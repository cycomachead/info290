overall
for
3
99
its
a
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
spend
much
more
than
that
on
it
though
at
this
point
to
me
its
better
than
high
life
its
got
some
toasted
bread
crust
flavors
and
i
like
that
try
it
you
might
just
like
it
when
the
ancient
babylonians
first
conceived
of
alcohol
they
could
scarcely
have
conceived
that
craft
brew
would
reach
such
heights
in
a
word
red
dog
is
magnificent
cosmopolitan
yet
accessible
pedestrian
but
somehow
suave
red
dog
is
the
great
equalizer
taking
the
complex
flavor
and
exquisite
texture
of
an
expensive
craft
beer
but
offering
it
a
price
point
that
puts
it
firmly
in
reach
of
the
average
8th
grader
if
you
drink
no
other
beer
before
you
die
drink
a
red
dog
whats
there
to
say
about
this
an
absolute
bottom
of
the
barrel
beer
great
stuff
when
youre
eighteen
and
working
up
the
courage
to
feel
up
your
girlfriend
for
the
first
time
subturpentine
probably
unrelated
but
i
had
to
poop
pretty
bad
after
drinking
this
look
at
the
red
dog
upside
down
it
looks
like
batman
eating
im
not
sure
the
rules
of
this
website
a
girls
vagina
red
dog
25
ah
red
dog
the
beer
my
parents
used
to
bribe
me
and
my
friends
with
to
help
clean
up
the
cottage
and
yard
when
opening
it
up
for
the
summer
maybe
its
just
good
memories
but
i
dont
think
it
is
that
bad
not
much
flavor
at
all
very
watery
but
nothing
bad
in
the
taste
either
either
way
the
only
reason
for
me
to
ever
drink
it
again
would
be
to
relive
some
old
memories
with
some
old
friends
a
trip
down
memory
lane
in
the
worst
way
the
beer
pours
a
near
clear
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
metallic
with
some
rice
smells
coming
through
taste
was
the
same
i
remember
it
as
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
had
and
almost
turned
me
away
from
beer
as
a
whole
not
good
by
any
stretch
but
it
was
interesting
to
relive
this
one
its
a
nostalgic
experience
for
me
it
was
the
very
first
beer
that
got
me
drunk
as
a
senior
in
high
school
i
also
remember
the
commercials
and
swag
from
the
mid90s
its
my
goto
beer
for
just
wanted
to
drink
one
after
another
when
working
in
the
garage
or
in
the
yard
red
dog
i
didnt
even
drink
this
when
i
was
in
college
i
wouldnt
drink
this
if
i
was
that
guy
from
127
hours
this
is
worse
than
any
beer
including
malt
liquor
i
have
ever
had
by
a
wide
margin
and
i
have
drank
a
lot
of
awful
beers
i
would
rather
siphon
and
drink
the
oil
from
my
lawnmower
than
taste
this
beer
again
it
is
not
safe
for
human
consumption
it
is
not
safe
for
rat
consumption
you
may
use
it
to
kill
the
weeds
in
your
yard
that
survive
other
products
advertised
for
such
purposes
which
fail
to
work
my
story
with
red
dog
began
a
long
while
ago
it
was
a
typical
morning
and
i
was
headed
to
my
local
liquor
store
here
in
rice
lake
wi
where
i
was
planning
on
purchasing
my
usual
24
ounce
miller
lite
i
had
brought
exact
change
to
buy
the
miller
but
to
my
dismay
there
had
been
a
sudden
increase
in
price
of
miller
and
i
no
longer
had
enough
for
it
because
of
this
i
was
forced
to
settle
for
a
less
expensive
beer
and
quickly
took
a
red
dog
out
of
the
cooler
instead
i
was
disappointed
while
leaving
the
liquor
store
but
my
sadness
was
quickly
alleviated
when
i
took
my
first
sip
of
red
dog
i
found
both
its
flavor
and
smoothness
to
be
uncommon
since
then
i
have
not
bought
any
other
kind
of
beer
red
dogs
flavor
is
bold
yet
smooth
and
takes
the
edge
off
of
a
stressful
morning
at
work
red
dog
is
a
beer
that
pairs
perfectly
with
a
nice
carton
of
marlboros
and
in
my
experience
is
best
enjoyed
early
in
the
morning
around
8am
red
dog
is
an
overall
flawless
beer
that
perfectly
embodies
all
qualities
that
an
american
stout
should
want
to
present
overallother
than
attending
your
20
year
reunion
to
see
if
your
old
girlfriend
got
fatwhat
were
you
thinking
when
you
asked
for
this
the
bartender
might
just
be
someone
you
stuffed
into
a
locker
back
in
high
school
otherwise
he
wouldnt
have
served
you
this
o
its
crisp
and
nicely
carbonated
little
bit
of
hops
theres
a
hint
of
mustiness
at
the
end
that
keeps
me
from
giving
a
definitive
endorsement
an
above
average
chugging
brew
for
the
price
this
is
a
great
budget
beer
and
one
that
i
truly
enjoy
to
have
from
time
to
time
in
indianapolis
a
30
pack
is
around
15
and
it
is
much
better
than
some
beers
at
the
same
price
for
50
cents
a
beer
it
is
an
a
plus
for
beer
overall
i
would
give
red
dog
a
solid
b
it
is
a
very
good
and
refreshing
cheap
aal
i
mean
i
cant
really
complain
at
11
06
for
a
30
pack
here
in
wisconsin
the
appearance
is
your
old
regular
american
adjunct
lager
the
smell
is
questionable
on
what
the
hell
am
i
drinking
the
taste
is
bold
but
cheap
in
flavors
its
a
adjunct
lager
folks
made
of
knock
off
products
id
stick
with
icehouse
its
big
brother
from
the
ficticious
plank
road
brewery
edit
after
pounding
a
few
i
reaffirm
my
previous
review
for
an
adjunct
id
give
it
a
not
bad
o
like
slightly
flavored
water
pretty
plane
and
bland
not
worth
the
dollar
bright
gold
lager
with
a
thin
sudsy
head
that
disappears
right
away
its
a
little
on
the
pale
side
looking
more
like
a
light
lager
aroma
of
sugary
grain
with
a
faint
musty
scent
dry
corn
and
grain
flavor
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
i
used
to
love
this
stuff
back
in
the
90s
but
it
doesnt
do
it
for
me
anymore
i
wonder
if
this
is
even
the
same
beer
i
remember
it
being
darker
final
thoughts
ive
never
had
red
dog
before
and
only
tried
it
now
because
one
was
left
in
my
fridge
i
couldnt
find
any
offflavors
only
a
refreshing
brew
that
caught
me
by
surprise
i
think
it
sells
for
something
like
10
a
30pack
probably
go
good
with
a
lime
would
i
drink
it
again
drink
it
yes
buy
it
unlikely
o
i
mostly
decided
to
order
this
one
for
nostalgias
sake
i
remember
having
this
beer
when
i
was
in
high
schoolcollege
and
before
there
were
a
lot
of
decent
craft
beers
to
enjoy
i
had
no
illusion
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
good
beer
but
honestly
it
was
not
as
bad
as
i
remembered
it
i
like
cheap
beers
and
this
one
is
near
perfect
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
light
wheaty
flavor
and
very
refreshing
i
know
that
by
beer
drinkers
standards
this
is
not
a
high
quality
item
but
thats
what
i
like
its
mild
and
not
at
all
overpowering
very
drinkable
im
not
one
to
savor
the
event
of
drinking
a
beer
this
is
one
you
can
guzzle
and
consume
mass
quantities
without
it
going
to
your
head
or
feeling
full
and
bloated
in
my
opinion
almost
the
perfect
beer
when
i
was
in
college
we
bought
this
for
6
a
12pack
that
was
20012003
this
is
a
pretty
simplistic
tasteless
beer
its
definitely
better
out
of
the
can
i
will
avoid
this
in
the
future
watching
some
saints
row
drinkin
some
red
dog
welcome
home
jonnycakes
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
light
wheat
and
a
smattering
of
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
corn
coming
through
sweeter
and
the
water
harder
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
given
this
beers
reputation
i
feel
its
not
all
that
bad
but
it
aint
anywhere
near
good
if
i
needed
a
cheap
sixpack
in
some
random
place
i
wouldnt
be
as
completely
averse
to
red
dog
as
i
would
be
toward
other
similar
options
i
would
be
lying
if
i
said
i
dont
get
nostalgic
whenever
i
pound
a
few
cans
just
look
at
the
badass
packaging
also
i
was
just
in
madison
a
couple
of
weekends
ago
where
i
saw
a
place
selling
a
30
pack
for
10
99
god
bless
america
ignore
the
beer
snobs
that
trash
this
beer
their
uber
sophisticated
palletes
will
never
be
able
to
appreciate
the
awesomeness
of
this
beer
this
beer
won
a
gold
medal
at
the
great
american
beer
festival
last
year
for
a
reason
its
one
of
the
best
american
adjunct
lagers
on
the
planet
this
beer
pours
from
the
can
looking
like
liquid
gold
the
smell
would
probably
bring
bob
mckenzie
to
his
knees
it
tastes
like
god
just
gave
me
a
golden
shower
overall
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
ever
created
and
should
be
a
constant
in
everyones
beer
rotation
good
luck
finding
a
better
beer
for
the
price
because
it
isnt
about
to
happen
the
taste
is
actually
where
the
divide
is
set
for
me
and
why
i
felt
compelled
to
write
a
review
for
this
beer
lets
be
fair
and
honest
at
12
99
a
30rack
where
im
from
you
know
exactly
what
youre
getting
when
you
set
youre
money
on
the
counter
but
inexplicably
it
tastes
better
to
me
than
a
lot
of
other
comparable
beers
i
e
american
genny
milwaukee
hard
alcohol
bite
that
shows
its
more
than
just
water
my
friends
and
i
have
dubbed
it
the
bite
of
the
dog
the
price
and
relatively
good
taste
make
it
perfect
for
a
basement
frat
party
or
a
trashy
family
reunion
o
overall
its
a
cheap
beer
in
the
price
range
you
either
get
this
or
hamms
and
i
guess
id
take
this
since
it
doesnt
have
the
same
sticky
consistency
that
hamms
has
nothing
special
but
you
could
purchase
far
worse
the
taste
is
quite
unique
though
i
find
its
got
an
odd
sweetness
to
it
that
i
dont
like
normally
i
have
no
problem
with
sweetness
but
this
is
a
strange
type
of
sweet
like
it
had
a
packet
of
artificial
sweetener
poured
into
what
was
otherwise
a
bland
dry
beer
its
not
terrible
its
probably
a
wee
bit
better
than
budweiser
but
there
are
better
beers
in
this
price
range
old
milwaukee
is
what
ill
be
sticking
with
much
better
than
this
garbage
it
does
its
job
as
what
its
intended
to
be
an
alcohol
delivery
system
its
got
to
be
ice
cold
or
its
nasty
i
like
its
little
brother
southpaw
better
o
best
shit
beer
if
i
need
beer
and
i
got
a
few
bucks
my
money
is
on
this
found
one
of
these
left
over
from
a
party
i
figured
i
would
rate
it
it
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
strong
head
that
fades
quickly
it
smells
faintly
like
a
floor
that
has
had
beer
spilled
on
it
a
week
ago
the
taste
is
tangy
sweet
with
a
crapload
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
an
adjunct
lager
that
is
cheap
and
a
vehicle
for
alcohol
not
much
more
clear
pale
body
12
fingers
of
white
foam
smells
and
tastes
like
what
it
is
a
cheap
adjunct
lager
you
know
exactly
what
youre
getting
when
you
buy
this
it
tastes
exactly
like
dozens
of
others
in
the
style
this
isnt
really
better
or
worse
than
any
of
the
others
just
another
mediocre
example
of
massproduced
cheap
beer
general
adjunct
lager
by
miller
under
the
guise
of
something
else
pours
a
pale
strawyellow
fizzy
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
that
recedes
to
just
about
nothing
aroma
of
pale
malts
grains
and
light
indistinct
hops
taste
of
beer
juice
light
mouthfeel
fizzy
and
weak
not
flavorful
at
all
but
goes
down
like
water
if
you
want
to
get
wasted
that
way
rough
aftertaste
flows
from
bitter
to
rancid
a
very
musty
taste
like
they
wanted
it
to
compliment
a
smoky
bar
with
such
an
aftertaste
i
think
this
beer
is
unfairly
bashed
when
i
judge
beers
i
factor
in
how
much
i
paid
for
it
and
honestly
when
i
can
get
a
30
pack
of
cans
for
12
or
a
12pk
of
bottles
for
6
i
am
not
expecting
an
amazing
beer
when
compared
to
all
the
other
cheap
beers
milwaukees
best
busch
light
keystone
etc
it
is
definitely
the
best
out
of
all
of
them
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
but
when
money
is
an
issue
or
if
it
is
the
only
thing
to
drink
i
would
not
be
upset
i
really
do
think
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
bow
wow
wow
yippy
yo
yippy
yea
rde
doggy
dawudogg
yeah
its
a
throw
back
but
gots
to
review
it
the
dawg
is
a
typical
miller
product
golden
clear
good
carbonation
that
gives
a
sudsy
white
head
for
a
short
time
there
is
no
smell
beside
grain
the
taste
is
typical
nothing
real
notible
the
mouthfeel
is
standard
lawn
mower
beer
the
beer
looks
like
your
average
macro
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
was
gone
in
seconds
it
smells
like
sweet
and
sour
corn
whoa
its
very
watery
tastes
like
old
water
its
musty
this
is
not
anything
i
would
ever
want
to
drink
again
it
is
very
thin
and
the
taste
is
not
pleasant
at
all
o
avoid
bad
cheap
beer
that
i
got
for
free
would
never
buy
as
it
has
no
quality
taste
and
smell
is
awful
attitude
going
in
to
a
night
of
red
dog
drinking
why
not
d
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
if
you
are
drinking
all
day
d
easy
to
drink
but
boring
musty
taste
is
a
turn
off
just
another
cheap
watered
down
bmc
beer
d
you
can
drink
this
stuff
all
day
and
not
worry
about
getting
full
but
for
those
of
you
college
dorm
room
kids
out
there
with
little
to
no
money
in
your
pocket
and
are
looking
for
a
way
to
say
you
drank
a
beer
or
two
this
is
your
best
choice
just
make
sure
you
dont
tell
anyone
who
knows
a
little
and
or
anything
about
beers
theyll
just
laugh
if
youre
in
college
with
no
money
then
red
dog
is
your
beer
but
if
you
like
a
good
flavor
with
your
beer
this
is
one
to
avoid
red
dog
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
and
has
the
familar
scent
that
american
adjunct
lagers
have
there
is
very
little
flavor
almost
to
the
point
that
it
tastes
like
beer
flavored
water
on
the
upside
it
does
drink
fairly
smooth
and
does
not
leave
a
bad
after
taste
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
and
taste
are
the
normal
macro
ingredients
this
beer
is
fresh
and
pretty
drinkable
i
imagine
this
is
at
its
best
during
the
hot
summer
months
when
its
ice
cold
i
would
recommend
and
would
purchase
again
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
three
fingers
of
white
head
this
offering
is
straw
colored
the
smell
is
sweet
and
grassy
the
taste
isnt
as
sweet
as
some
adjuncts
it
really
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
that
offers
a
slight
bite
it
goes
down
like
water
and
has
the
consistency
to
match
poured
a
dull
gold
into
my
pilsner
glass
a
nice
head
quickly
subsided
definitely
has
a
flavor
though
im
not
yet
adept
enough
to
describe
it
if
pressed
i
would
say
it
has
that
miller
flavor
the
beerlike
flavor
that
lite
has
just
a
little
more
of
it
theres
little
aroma
and
the
flavor
quickly
fades
away
drank
from
the
bottle
there
is
nothing
red
about
this
beer

a

it
might
be

for

breaking

not

the

is
a
little
stale

very
bitter
red

in

it
pours
a

with
a
big

that
doesnt
last
too
long
and
plenty
of
visible

the
smell
is
mercifully
weak

mostly
corny

sweetness
the
taste
is
watery
malt
that
if
fairly
clean
and
a
bit
of
a

taste
that
may
be
the
last
dying
attempt

get
noticed
of

the
big
problem
with

is
that
as

the
more
it

the

is
crisp

i

thats

when
youre

533overall
made
by
miller
actually
was
not
going
to
even
rate
this
but
beer
rating
means
every
beer
no
matter
what
reminded
me
of
what
my
dad
drank
years
ago
and
even
when
i
drank
mostly
macros
this
would
not
have
cut
it
simply
another
cheap
beer
along
the
lines
of
old
milwaukee
etc
fortunately
someone
left
this
at
my
house
so
i
actually
did
not
pay
good
money
for
it
i
am
somewhat
of
a
connoisseur
of
cheap
beer
this
one
isnt
very
good
though
high
life
and
schlitz
are
still
where
its
at
this
beer
is
fairly
decent
i
like
it
a
lot
a
plus
is
that
its
really
cheap
it
is
failry
smooth
has
a
bite
to
it
too
dont
think
its
bad
at
all
dont
know
why
people
think
its
so
bad
the
smell
of
the
beer
amazed
me
for
an
american
macro
lager
very
nice
its
worth
a
try
verdict
par
for
the
course
its
too
bad
red
dog
has
the
desired
strength
and
at
a
decent
price
but
in
this
case
millers
good
intentions
were
outstripped
by
its
execution
at
that
however
its
still
better
than
ice
beers
and
with
its
5
delivery
it
beats
a
surprising
number
of
other
cheap
stuff
it
was
very
cold
which
hid
most
of
the
smell
and
taste
picked
up
some
malt
grain
and
caramel
in
both
a
refreshing
drink
but
i
hesitate
to
call
it
a
refreshing
beer
nothing
special
cant
imagine
how
it
is
warmer
what
you
would
expect
maybe
a
touch
more
malt
presence
than
usual
in
this
style
ehhh
this
could
be
the
last
time
i
confront
the
red
dog
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
with
a
mediumsized
white
fizzy
quickly
diminishing
head
some
very
spotty
lacing
the
smell
is
very
mild
of
grain
and
corn
the
taste
is
well
not
great
but
not
as
horrible
as
i
was
expecting
corn
and
cereal
with
some
hay
and
a
slightly
crisp
finish
not
disgustingly
sweet
on
the
finish
either
thin
body
watery
texture
and
oddly
a
rather
low
carbonation
like
its
fizzed
it
all
out
on
the
pour
no
real
prize
here
but
far
from
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
oh
dear
god
taking
style
into
account
im
actually
giving
this
a
thumbsup
rating
nope
cant
bring
myself
to
do
it
nasty
a
really
awesome
example
of
a
horrid
attempt
at
making
a
red
beer
it
tastes
like
sour
funky
bread
terrible
i
cannot
understand
how
they
thought
a
red
beer
should
be
pale
yellow
in
color
grainy
and
astringent
in
smell
and
sour
and
bready
in
the
taste
not
impressed
and
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
not
try
this
one
again
holy
crap
this
is
bad
just
figured
i
would
try
it
cause
a
huge
can
was
1
29
knew
it
was
gonna
be
bad
though
this
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
color
people
mock
the
beer
because
it
isnt
red
but
who
the
hell
bought
a
red
dog
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
red
this
is
is
a
piss
swill
beer
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
unhealthy
looking
head
typical
macro
smell
of
ass
and
grains
the
chemical
smell
is
there
the
taste
is
fairly
harsh
lighty
sweet
but
disgustingly
sweet
and
corny
light
but
dirty
tasting
light
body
fizzy
and
prickly
mouthfeel
not
drinkable
well
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
since
i
wanted
to
try
it
in
1999
and
just
this
year
i
was
able
to
do
it
very
pale
almost
green
the
beer
foam
as
a
lager
but
just
a
few
but
what
is
great
is
the
dog
actually
it
looks
like
welcoming
you
and
like
showing
you
a
bottle
of
the
beerm
but
below
the
picture
if
alf
was
a
beer
he
would
be
an
ice
cold
red
dog
let
me
explain
why
miller
brought
this
adjunct
into
the
world
in
the
early
1990s
when
red
beers
were
a
fad
remember
that
oh
yeah
and
that
plank
road
brewery
thing
yeah
that
was
a
fad
too
having
macro
conglomerate
companies
make
virtually
the
same
product
under
a
different
name
now
that
the
red
beer
phase
has
sadly
come
and
gone
i
miss
my
red
wolf
anheuser
busch
this
beer
is
without
a
home
from
the
days
when
my
older
brother
picked
up
6packs
of
bottles
at
premium
prices
to
the
days
of
on
sale
30racks
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
robust
scent
of
barely
malt
and
corn
taste
is
also
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
left
in
the
palate
not
an
impressionable
beer
at
all
especially
when
trying
to
get
the
most
of
your
money
for
now
this
beer
will
live
on
in
college
frat
house
basements
with
all
loss
of
the
prestige
it
once
had
notes
not
a
good
one
im
not
sure
how
the
final
tally
will
come
out
since
i
havent
put
in
the
scores
yet
but
the
only
score
that
really
matters
to
me
is
taste
in
the
end
red
dog
is
the
slight
winner
over
the
more
highly
heralded
michelob
lager
i
could
drink
a
can
or
two
of
this
stuff
if
i
absolutely
had
too
ice
cold
and
accompanied
by
tonguenumbing
spicy
food
ideally
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
abundant
white
puffy
head
smell
is
minimal
with
only
a
slight
sweetness
noted
taste
is
very
mild
with
little
hops
or
malt
to
be
found
only
wetness
finishes
refreshing
but
not
much
more
good
thirst
quencher
spacer
beer
pours
pale
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
fades
to
abundant
lacing
in
a
few
seconds
no
detectable
hop
aroma
but
strong
with
malt
the
lack
of
hops
gives
an
unbalanced
flavor
tastes
like
low
alcohol
malt
liquor
adjunct
is
present
possibly
corn
or
rice
naturally
bad
tasting
beer
is
one
that
is
difficult
to
drink
even
the
high
carbonation
does
not
smooth
out
the
lingerng
aftertaste
a
bad
choice
for
a
cheap
session
brew
i
tell
myself
the
reason
i
review
these
types
of
beers
is
so
i
have
a
firm
appreciation
for
what
a
good
beer
is
when
i
taste
it
this
aint
it
the
mighty
red
dog
its
never
bad
when
its
free
it
pours
the
typical
golden
macro
color
and
has
no
head
the
aroma
is
bitter
a
chemical
bitter
so
it
is
wise
not
to
smell
it
before
you
drink
it
the
bland
corn
flavor
is
not
terrible
when
ice
cold
but
can
become
quite
gross
if
allowed
to
warm
up
this
is
not
the
worst
beer
made
but
it
is
by
no
means
worth
drinking
if
mgd
or
bud
is
available
a
refugeee
in
my
fridge
came
from
i
dont
know
where
clear
light
gold
color
with
about
2
of
foamy
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
smell
is
not
very
prominent
but
when
you
get
close
enough
smells
like
skunky
corn
taste
is
bland
but
whatever
flavor
it
has
is
fairly
off
not
a
lot
of
hops
presence
a
cheap
nasty
macro
which
ill
recommend
a
pass
on
from
the
22
cheaper
to
buy
this
than
a
12oz
poured
a
yello
with
a
white
head
aroma
metallic
corn
strawhints
of
malt
and
hops
flavor
corn
husks
wheat
light
malts
and
hops
the
only
reason
i
bought
this
that
bieristgut
said
i
should
rate
this
ill
get
even
with
him
red
dog
big
surprise
its
not
red
but
thats
okay
because
this
is
only
three
dollar
macroswill
in
fact
its
the
most
tasteless
macroswill
miller
has
to
offer
this
is
even
more
tasteless
than
budweiser
products
not
a
bad
job
for
a
cheap
macro
adjunct
lager
not
bad
at
all
if
i
want
a
crisp
clean
refreshing
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
anything
to
speak
of
ill
drink
red
dog
instead
of
paying
two
dollars
more
for
a
budweiser
this
mouthfeel
and
the
beer
is
under
carbonated
for
this
style
drinkabity
is
fine
for
what
it
is
the
beer
is
better
than
bud
coors
but
pales
next
to
some
of
the
good
regional
brews
think
point
old
style
etc
drinkability
id
have
this
again
when
im
low
on
money
and
still
want
some
beer
better
drinkability
than
light
macros
but
still
not
the
best
of
all
macros
we
used
to
call
our
diet
body
by
red
dog
for
good
reason
when
it
got
warmer
major
rice
or
corn
flavors
appeared
thumbs
down
ah
yes
the
dogs
red
not
the
beer
light
golden
color
slightly
bubbly
champagne
like
presence
tender
sweetness
combined
with
the
everpresent
adjunct
offerings
yet
they
mask
themselves
well
mainly
behind
some
malty
sweetness
crisp
and
slightly
carbonated
a
tiny
notch
above
the
standard
macro
a
mid90s
staple
that
has
since
disappeared
a
dear
old
friend
with
many
memories
a
friend
that
i
may
see
again
the
name
is
red
dog
the
colour
is
transparent
yellow
do
you
see
what
im
gettig
at
here
red
yellow
anyway
this
is
a
lackluster
poor
showing
for
a
beer
it
pours
a
weak
yellow
colour
with
a
thin
quickly
disipating
head
the
smell
was
all
skunk
it
was
absolutly
dreadful
looking
past
the
smell
i
took
a
taste
light
malts
with
a
healthy
dose
of
corn
thats
right
corn
the
same
stuff
you
eat
on
the
cob
you
know
goes
well
with
a
burger
thats
the
one
this
beer
wont
go
well
with
anything
one
good
thing
about
it
the
dog
on
the
label
looks
cool
an
all
round
crappy
beer
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
spotty
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
less
than
average
it
boasts
of
pale
malts
rice
and
lager
yeast
simply
awful
the
taste
is
awful
as
well
it
is
light
and
without
flavor
it
has
zero
malt
character
and
finishes
with
a
musty
aftertaste
very
watered
down
the
mouthfeel
sucks
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
was
my
beer
of
choice
when
i
was
16
but
now
i
wouldnt
drink
another
if
i
was
paid
drinkable
well
you
can
swallow
it
without
being
poisoned
cheers
drinkability

i
cant
actually
recommend
the
red
dog
but
if
you
have
to
choose
between
this
and
an
mgd
id
go
for
this
one
f
red
dog
attempts
to
suggest
its
a
microbrew
but
its
really
closer
to
massproduced
beer
although
im
always
grateful
to
a
friend
who
offers
me
a
beer
i
told
him
that
next
time
he
buys
cheaply
he
should
buy
pabst
blue
ribbonat
least
theres
a
hint
of
integrity
there
i
actually
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
heard
quite
a
few
bad
things
about
it
but
certainly
for
the
price
of
3
26
for
a
six
pack
ya
gotta
at
least
like
that
it
had
a
decent
aroma
and
had
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
as
well
it
was
nothing
spectacular
but
its
definitely
something
id
buy
again
in
the
future
this
is
my
absolute
favorite
of
the
cheap
american
beers
pale
yellow
in
color
rarely
retains
a
head
and
smells
like
preservatives
but
it
goes
down
the
best
of
any
of
them
slight
sweetness
in
taste
which
fades
quickly
and
leaves
little
to
no
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
nice
inwarm
weather
with
a
lime
i
always
have
this
in
my
fridge
for
my
cheap
beer
i
really
tried
hard
to
come
up
with
a
raison
detre
for
this
one
i
bought
it
thinking
it
might
be
somewhat
red
but
it
poured
out
of
the
bottle
the
usual
pissyellow
cheap
lager
color
no
smell
whatsoever
tastes
just
like
what
it
is
a
cheap
generic
lager
im
impressed
i
didnt
think
plank
road
could
come
up
with
something
even
less
interesting
than
icehouse
good
shot
miller
avoid
at
all
costs
this
isnt
red
in
color
like
i
thought
it
would
be
given
the
name
aroma
is
of
some
sweet
adjuncts
taste
is
of
corn
adjuncts
and
slight
hops
and
grain
but
it
goes
down
with
a
harsh
flavor
that
is
unyielding
to
backing
off
medium
body
and
decently
carbonated
just
not
that
good
of
a
beer
could
be
psychological
but
i
almost
think
there
is
a
reddish
tint
to
this
brew
in
any
event
the
head
is
weak
and
gone
in
no
time
theres
not
much
of
a
nose
but
well
call
it
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
watered
down
malt
the
taste
lets
see
there
must
be
some
taste
here
is
well
fruit
syrup
and
malt
certainly
no
hops
also
certainly
no
chance
that
ill
have
another
or
even
finish
this
one
next
now
it
tastes
like
a
typical
cheapo
american
lager
certainlly
a
better
deal
than
bud
or
coors
but
way
inferior
to
miller
high
life
red
dog
beer
is
not
so
great
though
but
for
cheap
cheap
macro
swill
it
is
my
favorite
soooo
cheap
a
buddy
of
mine
drinks
this
all
the
time
i
try
to
stay
away
from
it
a
light
yellow
color
with
hardly
any
head
no
aroma
with
very
little
taste
to
speak
of
i
would
choose
this
over
many
others
though
because
it
doesnt
have
a
bad
aftertaste
like
many
other
canned
beers
red
dog
came
off
very
harsh
it
had
a
high
alcohol
flavor
and
little
or
no
hops
or
corn
taste
to
me
it
was
nothing
more
than
water
and
alcohol
for
the
price
this
is
a
budget
beer
it
is
run
of
the
mill
when
consitering
quaility
i
would
recommend
icehouse
as
an
alternative
this
beer
poured
surprisingly
reddish
in
color
just
kidding
it
poured
a
straw
gold
color
the
head
was
white
in
color
but
you
better
not
blink
because
it
is
gone
that
fast
no
lace
the
aroma
was
of
corn
on
the
cob
in
the
boiling
water
cereal
grain
and
light
sweet
hop
lightly
carbonated
the
taste
was
watery
the
flavors
were
of
the
corn
grain
cereal
slight
sweet
malt
and
some
barely
noticeable
hops
it
ended
watery
again
with
the
corn
i
guess
if
it
were
free
and
there
was
nothing
else
and
it
were
very
hot
out
i
might
drink
again
i
dont
know
if
this
an
original
thought
but
i
feel
red
dog
is
miller
brewing
companys
attempt
at
bridging
the
gap
between
high
life
and
budweiser
the
corn
aromas
that
are
so
prevalent
in
miller
beers
are
very
muted
in
red
dog
although
perceptible
it
has
a
strange
metallic
feel
to
it
but
is
very
smooth
in
the
same
respect
lots
of
coarse
graininess
and
there
is
a
definite
malt
flavor
but
its
so
watered
down
that
it
obviously
distracts
the
taste
buds
into
noticing
the
metallic
twang
more
maybe
from
the
can
strangely
its
sort
of
crisp
and
refreshing
too
faint
hops
are
present
throughout
the
body
what
really
disturbs
me
is
that
ive
spent
so
much
time
thinking
so
hard
about
this
american
lager
swill
and
the
only
conclusion
i
can
come
to
is
that
this
really
is
swill
somebody
save
me
not
red
at
all
in
color
more
of
a
light
yellow
i
didnt
expect
much
taste
from
this
and
what
i
got
was
not
pleasant
the
small
hop
flavor
isnt
enough
to
save
this
beer
the
quality
reminds
me
of
armour
potted
meat
food
product
with
partially
defatted
cooked
pork
fatty
tissue
a
step
below
spam
i
dumped
out
about
half
this
beer
and
grabbed
the
only
other
beverage
at
the
party
an
alcopop
it
wasnt
a
good
night
for
drinking

very
unremarkable

decent

of

disappears
very
quickly

very

oh

better
than

jordanmay

but
this
is
a
rather
obvious
attmept
at
disguising
crap
beer
for
a
premium
product
id
rather
not
drink
than
have
one
of
these
johnjan

know
how
to
drink
the
beast
no
words
for
this
beer
i
dont
know
when
they
started
calling
this
premium
but
that
is
a
misnomer
to
say
the
least
gets
a
bad
rap
i
think
due
to
the
low
price
but
this
beer
is
not
bad
for
aal
i
go
b
decent
it
definitely
beats
bud
light
ahh
premium
beast
very
drinkable
but
nothing
else
when
you
attend
texas
tech
but
are
under
drinking
age
and
your
roommate
is
of
drinking
age
but
from
illinois
this
is
what
you
end
up
drinking
most
nights
thank
goodness
i
graduated
whats
the
point
i
mean
seriously
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
that
lingers
smells
quite
putrid
like
most
other
adjunct
lagers
goes
down
smooth
but
a
little
bitter
on
the
palate
not
much
flavor
but
not
bad
either
overall
not
bad
for
a
adjunct
lager
i
used
to
drink
this
in
high
school
when
it
first
came
out
and
good
thing
i
didnt
know
any
better
it
is
still
one
of
the
weakest
tasting
beers
out
there
it
is
cheap
so
if
your
beer
budget
is
10
per
month
this
might
be
the
beer
for
you
for
the
most
part
i
dont
find
this
much
different
than
so
many
adjuncts
as
the
corn
is
sweet
and
pervasive
it
does
have
a
bit
of
metallic
flavor
and
a
harsh
carbonated
feel
it
tastes
cheap
and
is
cheap
overall
a
solid

its

on
the

note
its
nothing
out

id
get
this
for
a
big
ass
party
that
mainly
would
consist
of
people
that
dont
even
know
what
the
term

retention
is
ill
give
the

the

this

the

milwaukees
best

has
the
look
and
smell
of
an
american
style
lager
the
taste
is
mild
with
corns
and
grans
lighter
than
what
i
was
expecting
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
not
bad
i
have
had
a
lot
worse
for
what
it
is
worth
this
brew
goes
down
smooth
with
a
nice
clean
finish
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
it
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
miller

co
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
overall
im
giving
milwaukees
best
premium
a
4
5
out
of
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
worst
of
the
cheap
beers
cheap
stuff
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
lwaukee
best
pours
to
a
clear
yellow
the
smell
is
nothing
new
to
me
just
your
typical
of
cook
vegetables
and
grains
it
does
not
bother
me
taste
like
a
typical
american
lager
grains
and
malts
the
hops
are
their
to
balance
the
beer
out
it
has
very
tiny
taste
of
cardboard
if
warm
but
other
the
that
milkwaulees
best
can
hold
its
own
against
high
price
budwesier
mgd
your
typical
american
lager
with
out
the
price
tags
it
is
the
lowest
price
beer
in
most
market
in
the
country
you
can
take
the
label
off
milwaukee
best
premium
beer
an
put
a
coors
or
mgd
label
on
this
beer
and
99
percent
of
the
people
would
not
know
they
would
be
drinking
a
cheap
beer
this
beer
is
excellent
for
what
it
is
american
adjunct
lager
i
rate
milwukee
best
preuim
with
other
maerican
adjunct
lagers
an
apples
with
apples
rating
meaning
i
rate
milwaukee
best
preuim
with
other
american
lager
ithis
beer
beats
out
95
percent
of
american
lagers
out
their
on
the
market
specially
mexical
lagers
with
their
high
price
milkwaulee
best
premium
is
the
best
value
on
market
for
taste
price
and
quality
for
a
cheap
beer
i
think
this
one
might
be
the
way
to
go
its
the
smoothest
of
all
the
beers
that
its
similar
to
and
has
a
slightly
more
refined
taste
it
also
drinks
very
light
you
can
chug
a
bunch
without
starting
to
feel
bloated
the
only
thing
i
would
change
is
that
its
less
than
5
alcohol
a
little
more
would
be
nice
overall
not
a
complete
disaster
for
the
price
point
but
ive
had
better
cheap
beers
than
this
this
isnt
terrible
for
what
it
is
good
hot
weather
beverage
and
in
my
opinion
is
as
good
as
any
other
aal
it
holds
it
own
with
such
brands
as
a
hamms
pbr
high
life
busch
etc
purchased
as
part
of
a
12
pack
for
8
49
thats
71
cents
a
can
folks
cheapest
beer
on
the
rack
this
is
a
somewhat
harsh
but
tasty
economy
macro
lager
miller
goes
too
heavy
with
the
corn
every
time
that
being
said
i
still
like
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
tasty
has
potential
good
value
not
the
highest
quality
ill
be
sure
to
try
this
one
again
in
a
week
or
so
id
like
to
give
it
that
second
chance
o
this
doesnt
taste
like
the
same
brew
i
had
15
20
years
ago
very
good
beer
peerless
in
its
price
range
1
for
24
oz
can
kudos
to
miller
o
overall
not
a
good
beer
at
all
though
honestly
not
the
worst
of
the
aals
nos
eis
terrible
but
the
taste
isnt
oto
bad
and
same
look
and
body
as
the
rest
in
the
bottom
half
of
the
normal
shelf
aals
but
not
the
worst
please
note
this
is
still
better
then
the
walgreens
beer
not
sure
how
they
justify
using
the
word
best
high
f
considering
the
price
and
fact
that
theres
nothing
that
makes
me
cringe
about
this
beer
id
certainly
have
it
again
middle
of
the
road
beer
o
overall
just
another
cheap
swill
oh
well
at
88
cents
for
a
24oz
can
i
knew
that
i
was
getting
realistically
at
that
price
it
makes
me
wonder
how
much
the
company
spends
to
make
a
24oz
can
of
this
stuff
i
mean
if
they
didnt
make
a
large
enough
profit
from
the
beer
youd
figure
that
they
would
stop
making
im
assuming
the
production
cost
per
can
is
somewhere
around
10
cents
think
about
that
before
you
buy
this
to
me
its
one
of
the
best
beers
for
its
price
the
light
is
ok
and
the
ice
beer
has
great
taste
but
i
get
headaches
after
a
few
it
has
great
taste
and
is
better
served
ice
cold
wish
you
could
find
it
on
tap
more
but
you
can
buy
it
at
most
super
markets
and
gas
stations
around
sc
o
i
am
not
as
repulsed
as
i
used
to
be
im
more
bored
now
12
ozers
in
a
suitcase
poured
into
a
styrofoam
cup
in
my
motel
one
by
one
took
about
9
of
these
before
i
could
swig
down
a
swallow
without
making
a
clicking
sound
with
my
cheeks
once
i
got
past
that
though
it
was
all
i
thought
it
could
be
got
me
crosseyed
piss
in
my
roomies
sock
drawer
drunk
left
me
with
a
skull
splitting
hangover
the
next
morning
everything
i
remember
from
it
in
college
is
still
true
final
thoughts
i
have
a
hard
time
really
slamming
this
beer
too
hard
because
its
basically
just
another
average
macrolager
while
not
particularly
enjoyable
this
is
just
the
usual
joesixpack
beer
i
have
no
idea
why
anyone
would
choose
to
drink
this
more
than
once
but
to
each
his
own
the
beast
as
its
called
is
very
drinkable
and
very
plain
no
offensive
sweetness
or
astringency
to
speak
of
that
being
said
i
consider
this
a
dirty
beer
as
in
youll
wake
up
feeling
crappy
the
next
day
not
bad
for
the
price
i
guess
milwaukees
best
beer
well
sometimes
you
need
a
break
from
oilthick
imperial
stouts
and
blast
your
tongue
away
signature
ipas
as
great
as
they
may
be
milwaukees
best
is
just
that
beer
as
a
beverage
the
golden
color
light
carbonation
and
thin
head
let
you
know
this
is
just
beer
while
not
as
pretty
as
a
salvation
ipa
from
avery
it
looks
more
refreshing
than
a
coke
or
mountain
dew
there
is
some
aroma
which
is
a
plus
flavor
combines
light
malt
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
overall
its
beer
as
a
beverage
and
no
more
but
as
summer
approaches
and
it
is
time
to
shed
the
pounds
that
all
of
those
stouts
and
ipas
added
over
the
winter
a
spell
of
just
drinking
plain
jane
beer
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
i
didnt
bother
pouring
this
one
out
of
the
can
in
order
to
observe
appearance
that
was
not
how
this
beer
was
intended
to
be
consumed
i
did
decide
to
compare
it
side
by
side
to
my
current
favourite
economy
beer
old
milwaukee
ive
got
to
say
its
a
pretty
good
supereconomy
beer
nothing
offensive
about
it
whatsoever
fairly
dry
and
crisp
with
just
a
hint
of
corn
i
like
it
when
brewers
dont
try
to
hide
corn
flavour
with
something
more
offensive
or
when
they
just
remove
all
flavour
it
does
not
stack
up
to
old
milwaukee
though
old
milwaukee
has
more
taste
and
i
think
might
even
be
cheaper
so
this
may
not
be
the
best
option
and
i
may
not
buy
it
again
but
its
definitely
a
better
option
than
busch
lone
star
keystone
etc
its
about
on
par
with
the
average
batch
of
the
ultracheap
big
flats
but
as
my
review
of
that
beer
indicates
the
flavour
of
that
beer
is
not
consistent
its
pretty
much
what
i
expected
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
the
color
of
straw
with
a
tall
white
head
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
mild
there
are
aromas
of
malt
corn
and
some
hops
the
flavor
is
also
mild
the
malt
corn
and
hop
flavors
are
mild
but
balanced
it
is
watery
but
also
grainygritty
the
body
is
light
there
is
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
the
drinkability
is
fair
overall
the
beast
is
the
very
definition
of
getting
what
you
pay
for
if
youre
on
a
budget
skip
this
and
go
with
old
milwaukee
o
i
cant
beat
up
on
this
beer
too
much
for
1
20
you
get
an
easy
drinking
beer
thats
low
on
flavor
its
not
offensive
and
its
not
too
corny
or
overtly
sweet
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
another
college
tick
pours
light
golden
with
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
stale
corn
and
straw
with
some
additional
unpleasant
funk
flavor
follows
with
light
corn
and
a
rather
dirty
finish
to
boot
light
body
and
high
carbonation
but
thats
about
all
this
has
going
for
it
avoid
o
yes
this
is
a
cheap
beer
like
most
things
you
get
what
you
pay
for
i
actually
like
the
beast
more
than
the
mgd
i
punished
myself
with
the
other
day
this
was
the
main
beer
we
drank
in
college
and
it
soothed
many
a
pain
post
rugby
games
maybe
i
am
just
conditioned
to
its
lack
luster
taste
out
of
a
40
bottle
hey
this
is
baltimore
this
beer
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
super
fluffy
white
head
the
retention
was
good
especially
as
a
collar
and
it
left
consistent
spots
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
corn
rice
and
faint
malt
the
flavors
were
mostly
of
corn
and
sweet
malt
as
well
as
a
little
floral
hops
at
the
end
simple
but
nonoffensive
and
actually
much
better
than
most
beers
available
in
40s
the
mouthfeel
was
average
albeit
watery
standard
for
the
style
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
medium
overall
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
but
i
readily
admit
i
have
had
much
worse
beast
indeed
but
not
a
complete
abomination
am
i
really
drinking
this
poured
this
american
lager
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
produces
a
below
average
white
head
retention
was
poor
the
aroma
smelled
of
faint
traces
of
grain
faint
traces
of
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
light
in
body
flavor
of
grain
and
corn
semi
sweet
very
thin
brew
overall
very
cheap
piss
poor
beer
even
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
i
think
this
has
recently
been
restaged
as
premium
and
im
not
sure
if
the
recipe
was
changed
but
its
pretty
bad
it
tastes
like
rotgut
bottomofthebarrell
stuff
i
think
sabm
has
relegated
the
whole
miller
family
to
the
budget
category
and
this
is
the
lowest
rung
headache
material
for
sure
try
to
avoid
poured
one
into
a
glass
for
reviewing
purposes
pours
a
straw
gold
with
an
inch
of
foamy
white
on
top
the
nose
is
cheap
and
weak
with
a
metallic
twang
to
it
slick
body
that
goes
down
easily
mild
husky
flavors
that
are
spot
on
for
this
inexpensive
brew
simple
thirstquenching
cheap
most
likely
wont
have
again
but
its
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
had
o
this
stuff
is
even
worse
than
i
remember
it
being
the
beast
deserves
to
be
feared
overall
this
beer
is
bad

which
you
pay

pours
to
a
quickly
dissipating
head
and
a
strange
goldstraw
color
with
a
slight
tint
of
caramel
color
smells
of
cooked
corn
and
slight
sulfur
form
the
yeast
flavor
is
grainy
corny
with
a
splash
of
cheap
chablis
in
the
finish
no
discernible
hop
presence
just
a
nondescript
bite
that
balances
the
grain
finishes
dry
with
lingering
corn
notes
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
overall
for
me
today
this
beer
is
not
terrible
just
not
anything
particularly
interesting
its
dry
crisp
refreshing
and
a
great
value
for
the
price
overall
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
catastrophe
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
i
will
never
buy
this
again
overall
its
a
good
sub
when
drinking
with
the
masses
who
dont
enjoy
good
beer
overall
this
beer
really
isnt
too
bad
i
really
liked
that
i
could
actually
taste
hops
in
it
i
would
recommend
this
for
people
on
a
budget
and
to
people
who
are
sick
of
budweiser
and
coors
i
will
get
this
again
keep
it
part
of
my
cheap
can
beer
rotation
never
again
d
i
was
surprised
this
is
nowhere
near
as
bad
as
i
had
remembered
from
many
drunken
nights
at
the
fraternity
house
typical
for
the
style
and
yet
without
the
shortcomings
of
many
brews
milwaukees
best
holds
strong
amongst
many
bmc
brews
d
drinkable
cold
this
is
actually
the
beer
i
buy
for
mindless
beers
with
friends
cheap
imageless
flavorless
the
beast
is
even
worse
than
i
remember
it
being
in
college
im
sticking
with
pbr
drinkability
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
bar
none
it
literally
is
nearly
flavorless
with
the
only
flavor
it
does
have
being
unpleasant
and
offputting
milwaukees
best
premium
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
that
faded
before
i
finished
pouring
the
aroma
is
light
and
grainy
more
slightly
sweet
graininess
appears
in
the
flavor
with
no
hint
of
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
overall
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
the
price
but
its
not
really
offensive
either
its
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
remember
from
my
early
college
days
this
is
another
beer
to
mow
and
play
golf
with
it
is
good
for
that
at
least
i
usually
have
this
in
cans
when
i
do
have
it
and
it
tastes
fine
smells
ok
drinks
well
and
is
cheap
and
easy
to
find
it
is
like
the
rest
of
these
mass
produced
beers
i
would
not
drink
it
again
possibly
one
of
the
worst
beers
ever
invented
alongside
its
counterparts
old
milwaukee
milwaukees
best
ice
it
has
the
same
textures
as
any
regular
malt
liquor
the
smell
is
faint
when
it
goes
down
even
when
its
cold
it
has
a
very
watery
but
thick
taste
its
not
a
very
pleasant
experience
it
is
a
very
foamy
one
it
when
it
is
poured
in
a
glass
i
will
admit
it
is
a
challenge
to
any
beer
drinker
specially
ones
who
are
in
to
more
higher
end
lagers
ales
milwaukees
best
premium
has
a
light
orange
colour
not
much
head
but
some
lacing
the
smell
is
grainy
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
little
malty
with
some
metallicness
at
the
end
its
quite
carbonated
so
it
feels
ok
in
your
mouth
quite
drinkable
this
isnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
drank
straight
from
the
32
oz
bottle
no
real
smell
goes
down
extremely
easy
was
in
the
freezer
for
about
45
mins
so
it
is
pretty
cold
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
for
something
this
cheap
would
definitely
do
this
one
again
but
i
would
probably
stick
with
the
bottle
taste
decent
taste
for
a
adjunct
lager
id
rather
drink
this
than
budweiser
theres
actually
some
noticeable
hops
awful
this
beer
just
smells
from
moldly
boiled
rice
and
distilled
alcohol
pale
yellowish
color
no
head
no
lacing
makes
me
wonder
why
i
am
drinking
this
and
who
would
buy
this
the
flavor
is
mostly
of
the
bitter
moldy
rice
avoid
unless
your
aying
beer
pong
pours
a
nasty
looking
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
head
no
lacing
smells
pretty
decent
for
adjunct
like
creamed
corn
and
some
acid
taste
like
crap
malty
sweet
bitter
from
what
i
do
not
know
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
carbonation
is
extraordinarily
high
drinkability
is
pretty
poor
verdict
itll
get
you
drunk
but
thats
about
the
only
thing
going
for
it
doesnt
really
taste
too
great
to
me
deasy
to
drink
if
youre
trying
to
get
drunk
for
cheap
milwaukees
best
d
actually
this
is
an
okay
brew
depending
on
the
situation
i
works
fine
as
a
lawnmower
beer
overall
it
was
not
terrible
but
i
doubt
i
would
go
there
again
i
did
not
really
mind
it
per
se
d
a
below
average
adjunct
nothing
really
to
seperate
it
from
the
rest
of
the
macro
pack
yet
i
will
never
buy
this
again
what
can
you
say
about
a
beer
thats
13
99
for
a
30
pack
this
is
some
seriously
bad
beer
but
it
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
alcoholics
hobis
and
poor
college
kids
if
you
know
anything
about
beer
you
already
know
better
than
to
crack
open
one
of
these
but
if
youre
desperate
and
broke
this
is
the
way
to
go
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
very
easily
and
its
not
too
filling
since
there
isnt
much
to
it
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
an
underwhelming
style
for
the
type
of
beer
its
made
to
be
it
isnt
bad
but
overall
its
just
another
fizzyyellowbeer
dpick
up
for
memories
or
only
when
you
are
low
on
cash
drinks
good
goes
down
easy
not
very
tasty
but
cheap
from
the
newly
designed
can
no

sampled
on
june

2010
well
the
new
can
design
highlights
it
as
a
premium
beer
it
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
rising
to
a
quick
burst
of
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
the
aroma
is
really
nothing
at
all
maybe
a
little
bit
of
grains
rice
and
a
faint
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
the
taste
has
a
microspoon
more
in
malts
than
the
aroma
but
it
is
otherwise
very
typical
of
adjunct
lagers
easy
to
drink
many
but
nothing
to
remember
it
by
as
long
as
it
is
cold
or
at
end
of
night
drinking
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
i
do
not
know
about
this
beer
i
cannot
find
anything
on
the
internet
about
it
so
it
is
either
a
new
labeling
nobody
knows
about
or
it
is
a
new
release
oh
well
overall
if
you
need
to
drink
this
and
want
a
buzz
drink
light
you
can
probably
stomach
more
of
that
drinkability
not
in
your
worst
nightmare
yuck
bottom
line
you
may
or
may
not
like
this
but
keeping
in
mind
what
i
paid
i
dont
think
it
can
beat
bad
beer
dont
drink
it
pours
a
light

cheers
milwaukees
best
was
the
worst
beer
of
the
three
and
maybe
the
worst
cheap
beer
ive
ever
had
but
that
doesnt
make
it
the
loser
of
the
tasting
that
would
be
me
seriously
who
does
a
beer
tasting
by
himself
with
three
crappy
beers
and
takes
notes
on
them
rjt
how
can
i
say
anything
bad
about
the
beast
mouthfeel
theres
really
nothing
to
grasp
onto
drinkability
it
gets
a
bump
up
because
its
cheap
and
people
do
drink
it
really
fast
because
its
like
water
wow
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
so
i
grabbed
up
a
40
ounce
bottle
for
under
2
its
not
impressive
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
clear
yellowish
color
watery
mouthfeel
almost
no
smell
and
pretty
bland
overall
flavor
not
to
bad
here
while
munching
on
chips
but
i
would
not
reach
for
it
again
thin
and
watery
almost
no
flavor
until
the
aftertaste
its
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
just
nothing
much
at
all
it
has
the
mouthfeel
of
water
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
no
bitterness
overall
im
just
really
bored
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
but
one
was
enough
d
i
wouldnt
drink
again
but
was
regular
to
accompany
my
meal
very
light
clear
yellow
color
the
smell
is
very
grainy
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
there
short
and
sweet
the
taste
is
pretty
much
water
and
alcohol
its
got
nasty
sting
to
it
poorly
brewed
in
my
opinion
i
dont
think
you
should
get
this
beer
unless
you
have
a
personal
preference
to
it
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
certainly
some
corn
here
taste
is
crisp
and
basically
flavorless
some
mild
bitterness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
a
very
easy
drinking
yet
very
boring
beer
this
is
definitely
a
cheap
drunk
beer
in
my
opinion
picked
up
a
30
pack
for
14
99
if
one
was
tired
of
malt
liquor
or
the
usual
5
9
abv
ice
lager
than
this
is
a
good
change
overall
id
pass
on
it
boring
but
nothing
offensive
either
just
for
tossing
back
with
ease
drinkability
if
you
want
to
use
this
crap
to
get
drunk
drink
it
cold
real
cold
and
for
all
thats
holy
dont
smell
the
stuff
i
used
to
drink
this
stuff
when
i
was
a
kid
but
i
cant
imagine
drinking
it
ever
again
mfd
overcarbonated
light
body
eh
edit
oh
dear
god
this
review
put
some
beer
in
my
mug
i
hope
its
not
this
beer
in
it
overall
oh
what
fond
memories
i
have
with
this
beer
not
because
its
good
but
the
parties
its
happened
to
be
at
unfortunately
this
beer
is
terrible
and
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
who
actually
likes
some
marcolagers
i
guess
at
16
for
a
30rack
you
cant
beat
the
value
but
bear
in
mind
its
cheap
for
a
reason
to
give
this
beer
some
credit
though
i
think
id
still
take
it
over
keystone
or
natty
ice
but
for
ever
so
slightly
more
money
youre
much
better
off
with
some
pbr
if
its
marco
lager
youre
after
to
its
credit
it
does
have
a
fair
amount
of
flavor
its
got
the
three
cs
unfortunately
those
would
be
corn
cardboard
and
carbonation
in
this
case
not
too
much
trouble
finishing
off
the
tall
boy
but
its
not
a
very
good
beer
and
there
are
many
other
adjunct
lagers
i
would
rather
drink
pours
a
pale
pale
yellow
color
with
a
slight
head
the
smell
is
of
cheap
alcohol
and
water
the
taste
is
metalic
with
no
hops
and
barely
a
little
grain
there
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
carbonated
overall
you
would
not
want
to
drink
many
of
these
it
is
a
typical
macro
smell
and
taste
of
cheap
corn
and
water

thankfully
it
was
free
d
throw
this
in
the

drinkability
i
suppose
if
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
had
i
could
choke
down
a
couple
but
its
not
really
worth
it
a
pale

with
a
big
fizzy

that
faded
very
quicklyno

nonexistantbut
as
it
warms
a
couple
of
degrees
it
takes
on

odd
sweet

tastethin
body
and
stinky
finish
i
can
drink
this
if
i
am
dying
from
thirst
but
save
your
money
and
buy
some
real
beer
eh
i
dont
even
know
why
i
drank
this
in
the
first
place
i
disappoint
myself
pale
yellow
with
a
solid
cap
of
fizzy
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
into
a
skim
smells
of
grits
and
faintly
of
grain
alcohol
and
just
a
whiff
of
used
up
hops
tastes
pissy
and
metallic
really
pretty
shitty
even
for
bargain
macro
swill
thin
and
watery
dont
bother
with
this
stuff
there
are
much
better
beers
even
for
this
price
it
really
needs
to
have
a
higher
abv
cause
the
only
reason
to
drink
this
is
to
get
drunk
immediate
skunk
aromahad
to
turn
away
poured
into
a
long
pilsner
glass
and
big
bubbles
camenot
my
girlfriend
the
beer
seemed
a
bit
too
aromatic
at
first
then
mellowed
to
a
bitter
bitter
mouthfeel
with
almost
promoted
a
protein
spill
half
way
through
it
became
drinkable
but
oh
my
god
it
was
tough
finally
after
seven
of
these
monsters
i
switched
to
bourbon
and
cokes
seemd
like
a
good
beer
at
the
time
of
purchase
but
it
compared
what
i
think
it
would
be
like
eating
sidewalk
chaulk
and
drinking
chicken
broth
at
the
same
time
very
shocked
at
how
bad
this
beer
is
no
redeeming
qualities
just
a
lot
of
bad
pale
in
color
and
light
in
flavor
the
fact
that
this
is
called
milwaukees
best
does
not
say
much
out
the
city
of
milwaukee
if
i
lived
there
i
would
protest
stay
clear
of
this
one
it
will
let
you
down
pale
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
and
taste
are
your
normal
macro
lagers
refreshing
and
smooth
perfect
for
summer
outdoor
outings
this
is
exactly
what
you
you
expect
from
a
macro
no
more
no
less
i
will
always
have
room
in
my
fridge
for
beast
overall
one
of
the
essential
college
frat
party
keg
beers
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
but
only
have
5
in
your
wallet
milwaukees
best
is
the
way
to
go
speaking
of
which
if
this
is
really
the
best
milwaukee
has
to
offer
then
i
dont
think
i
want
to
try
any
other
beers
from
there
you
wanted
cheap
beer
you
got
it
brother
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
little
head
with
no
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
adjunct
in
lager
fits
the
style
a
crisp
feel
with
low
carbonation
tastes
of
a
weak
lager
with
lots
of
adjunct
overall
not
worth
recommending
the
body
is
too
weak
for
anything
but
drinking
a
lot
of
beer
and
not
getting
full
getting
smashed
the
beast
easily
the
best
of
the
worst
pours
clear
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
aroma
is
metallic
and
veggie
kind
of
canned
beans
some
b
o
in
the
nose
and
a
bit
funky
in
the
taste
more
veggie
and
grass
some
actual
bitter
hops
and
pale
malt
its
bad
but
not
atrocious
i
filled
my
1
liter
oktoberfest
mug
with
a
40
oz
of
this
stuff
very
foamy
white
suds
like
a
washing
machine
with
too
much
soap
very
clear
yellowgold
fluid
its
stinky
beer
like
chemicals
hay
and
corn
nothing
pleasant
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
taste
but
otherwise
not
very
good
but
not
much
worse
than
bud
typical
cheap
beer
watery
and
cheaply
available
in
the
college
classic
40
oz
id
buy
it
again
if
i
only
had
two
bucks
in
my
pocket
and
i
was
walking
past
the
cvs
i
could
drink
it
behind
the
dumpster
pretty
bad
you
used
to
be
able
to
get
this
at
the
duty
free
shop
for
50
cents
a
can
at
that
you
gotta
be
a
real
asshole
to
complain
about
anything
in
the
taste
but
its
pretty
bad
id
love
to
be
more
specific
but
if
youre
reading
this
and
wondering
whether
to
buy
some
old
milwaukee
tonight
go
ahead
d
not
again
thank
you
very
much
if
youve
got
4
bucks
burning
a
hole
in
your
pocket
team
up
with
a
buddy
and
split
a
6pack
of
something
respectable
unless
youre
a
hundred
year
old
man
with
fond
memories
for
fishing
the
lakes
of
wisconsin
youve
got
no
business
drinking
this
beer
d
eh
it
looks
tastes
and
smells
pretty
blah
but
its
no
worse
or
more
difficult
to
drink
that
any
other
adjuncty
bargainbasement
macro
it
is
what
it
is
a
cheap
party
beer
dont
be
discouraged
with
the
mainstream
attitudes
towards
this
beer
just
because
a
beer
in
inexpensive
doesnt
mean
it
cannot
be
a
good
beer
hence
my
love
of
this
american
classic
the
beast
this
is
probably
one
of
the
worst
beers
out
there
like
many
others
im
sure
i
first
had
this
in
college
and
honestly
had
trouble
drinking
it
then
yellow
color
not
much
head
malty
corn
rice
taste
which
is
watery
and
semisyrupy
offensive
but
hey
at
least
its
cheap
d
doable
in
a
tight
situation
but
wouldnt
push
it
and
certainly
wouldnt
brag
about
it
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
with
a
slight
creaminess
from
the
carbonation
oddly
i
like
this
a
lot
better
than
miller
high
life
still
as
a
summer
lawnmower
beer
its
just
about
as
refreshing
as
they
come
ive
only
ever
tasted
it
on
tap
as
its
my
schools
crappy
beer
of
choice
every
college
has
one
after
drinking
it
for
so
long
ive
learned
not
to
mind
it
so
much
but
it
is
by
no
means
a
worthy
brew
after
all
this
conditioning
ill
admit
ive
learned
to
like
it
more
than
some
other
crap
beers
like
natty
light
and
if
youre
going
to
be
playing
beer
games
with
it
then
it
does
well
enough
however
id
never
recommend
tasting
it
while
you
drink
it
gulp
it
down
at
a
taste
budnumbing
temperature
even
fresh
it
has
a
weak
taste
neither
of
hops
nor
of
malt
and
is
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
not
too
appealing
but
very
chuggable
as
with
most
macro
lagers
and
malt
liquors
it
is
what
it
is
drink
it
as
cold
as
possible
and
dont
expect
much
going
in
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
texas
day
the
feel
is
way
to
light
and
has
way
too
much
carbonation
hard
to
drink
i
would
rather
have
a
water
i
bought
a
tall
boy
can
which
i
then
poured
into
a
glass
producing
two
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
foamy
head
which
slowly
reduced
to
about
a
halfafingers
worth
and
then
experienced
decent
retention
the
color
was
a
light
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
slightly
sweet
somewhat
lagerlike
but
underlain
with
a
musty
metallic
quality
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
with
only
a
faint
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
had
a
graininess
accompanied
by
a
metallic
aftertaste
oof
i
would
not
recommend
allow
this
to
achieve
anything
close
to
room
temperature
heck
i
would
not
recommend
this
period
my
friend
loves
this
for
some
reason
and
the
night
i
drank
it
it
was
free
dear
lord
how
dare
they
call
this
milwaukees
best
everyone
who
lives
in
milwaukee
should
be
outraged
that
their
citys
name
is
on
this
swillpiss
it
is
watery
thin
and
tastes
like
nothing
with
a
tick
of
old
corn
maybe
if
so
that
taste
is
even
faint
but
what
did
i
expect
anyway
for
a
cheap
brew
for
the
price
he
should
have
bought
pbr
it
tastes
much
better
and
for
about
the
same
price
in
nh
why
bother
ickickick
if
you
can
get
by
the
first
few
beers
this
brew
can
be
drunk
all
night
long
but
it
will
catch
up
with
you
in
the
morning
this
beer
has
earned
the
name
the
beast
d
drank
this
in
high
school
when
we
were
broke
or
stole
some
from
a
friends
old
man
only
for
the
alcohol
would
you
drink
this
not
good
md
smooth
like
water
not
much
here
nothing
particularly
attractive
about
this
beer
accept
for
the
price
and
then
you
still
find
yourself
weighing
the
pros
cons
i
had
to
laugh
when
i
read
reviews
of
this
because
i
couldnt
agree
more
this
is
a
college
beer
everyone
should
experience
in
their
younger
days
i
laughed
because
i
remember
this
and
beast
ice
before
turning
21
were
staples
in
my
college
partying
days
the
regular
beast
wasnt
my
preferred
option
because
i
wanted
to
get
drunk
but
it
is
a
better
beer
the
smell
is
slightly
more
grainy
and
less
metallic
and
it
has
a
smoother
slide
compared
to
the
bitter
ice
that
doesnt
mean
it
is
good
or
anything
in
fact
it
is
quite
pungent
also
but
not
too
horrible
probably
one
of
the
cheapest
domestics
you
can
get
and
for
good
reason
cheap
beer
it
should
be
cheaper
fitting
beer
to
wash
down
hot
wings
enter
a
drinking
contest
or
if
you
are
on
skid
row
and
are
allergic
to
grapes
commercial
beer
industrial
chimical
blonde
like
all
the
others
no
distinction
among
all
no
interest
for
the
beer
lover
exept
to
quentch
thirst
and
to
pollute
whith
the
empty
cans
bad
beer
but
still
it
has
its
public
d
i
didnt
actually
mean
to
buy
this
beer
i
thought
that
it
was
old
milwaukee
which
imo
is
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
rockbottom
price
and
picked
up
a
12pack
there
are
several
cheapo
beers
that
are
decent
pbr
old
milwaukee
stag
and
icehouse
this
however
is
nasty
so
if
you
have
to
go
the
cheapo
route
avoid
this
nasty
sour
rotgut
metallic
beast
at
all
costs
heaviness
of
the
beer
prevents
you
from
being
able
to
drink
many
of
these
d
refreshing
but
so
bland
it
seems
pointless
to
pay
for
it
hurt
by
slightly
off
cheap
beer
taste
very
drinkable
i
suppose
for
what
it
is
im
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
the
rest
of
the
12
pack
since
it
only
takes
three
cans
to
boil
the
brats
milwaukees
best
pours
a
surprisingly
golden
body
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
bright
white
foam
that
holds
fairly
well
before
dropping
to
a
standard
collar
some
minor
lacing
is
left
behind
the
aroma
is
a
fairly
generic
combination
of
malt
and
nondescript
hops
its
mediumlight
in
body
and
quite
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
as
the
aroma
suggests
its
basic
but
clean
theres
some
bitterness
to
it
but
not
much
is
really
needed
as
theres
not
really
that
much
malt
it
finishes
with
a
dull
residue
of
malt
left
behind
in
the
mouth
eric
milwaukees
best
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
twelve
ounce
can
nasty
aroma
some
of
these
sub
premium
macros
really
have
kind
of
a
chemical
aroma
flavors
seem
kind
of
raw
or
harsh
corn
is
the
predominant
taste
drink
it
cold
and
drink
it
quick
if
you
plan
on
drinking
this
one
by
the
time
it
warmed
up
it
was
truly
nasty
i
think
you
are
risking
a
bad
hangover
drinking
even
a
little
bit
of
this
stuff
this
beer
led
to
my
worst
beer
experience
ever
i
was
given
this
at
a
bar
in
memphis
tennessee
it
was
clear
enough
that
i
could
read
the
newspaper
through
the
full
glass
no
aroma
to
speak
of
and
very
little
flavour
i
asked
the
waitress
what
it
was
she
replied
its
milwaukees
best
i
replied
that
if
that
was
milwaukees
best
i
would
hate
to
taste
their
worst
i
was
promptly
asked
to
leave
the
bar
this
is
better
than
i
anticipated
there
are
far
worse
beers
out
there
than
this
well
worth
the
0
25
i
paid
for
it
one
is
enough
but
i
dont
feel
dirty
for
drinking
it
like
i
said
the
beast
is
only
good
for
a
cheap
substitute
do
not
expect
to
experience
much
and
if
your
beer
is
guiness
you
will
hate
it
do
not
drink
quality
beer
before
drinking
this
if
your
need
a
good
thirty
and
only
have
1015
this
is
perfect
for
you
this
is
just
what
the
average
fakebeer
drinker
would
pick
up
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
for
a
macro
it
should
be
served
ice
cold
kind
of
a
little
refreshing
then
a
few
days
later
i
talked
him
into
buying
us
some
budweiser
and
i
thought
it
was
the
best
beer
in
the
world
i
guess
compared
to
the
beast
bud
isnt
all
that
bad
all
and
all
an
average
cheap
macro
not
too
bad
if
youre
looking
for
flavor
from
something
cheap
for
a
similiar
price
i
would
choose
pbr
or
schlitz
hands
down
dont
be
fooled
this
beer
has
also
won
awards
drink
up
i
hadnt
had
this
one
in
years
and
couldnt
resist
the
4
99
12
pack
price
the
nose
is
cereal
grain
corn
with
a
whiff
of
the
inside
of
somebodys
pickup
truck
i
once
got
a
lift
in
ditto
on
the
flavor
thin
and
watery
it
goes
down
easily
but
without
any
satisfaction
what
little
finish
there
was
served
to
inform
me
that
now
i
had
become
that
old
pickup
truck
i
had
once
ridden
in
there
is
still
more
in
the
fridge
so
i
will
have
to
push
on
through
milwaukees
best
was
a
very
clear
light
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
was
of
decent
size
to
start
with
but
almost
immediatly
dissapeared
leaving
no
lace
the
aroma
was
grainy
the
taste
was
sweet
and
grainy
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
light
with
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
below
average
overall
it
is
a
crappy
beer
that
should
be
avoided
well
i
guess
its
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
though
this
is
a
beer
best
drunk
straight
from
the
can
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
very
little
head
what
is
there
slowly
disipates
to
a
thin
film
pungent
smell
overcooked
veggies
corn
and
corn
syrup
pretty
much
adjunct
ridden
scent
taste
is
a
bit
better
well
their
is
hardly
any
taste
to
be
offended
at
a
bit
of
an
artificial
sweetness
an
almost
sour
bitterness
not
impressed
but
not
overly
horrid
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
and
almost
salty
drinkable
well
i
have
had
far
far
worse
than
this
would
i
want
to
drink
it
again
hell
no
but
if
offered
to
me
in
a
can
at
temperatures
at
almost
absolute
zero
i
might
not
refuse
drinkability
its
a
no
brainer
its
just
a
good
beer
for
relaxing
and
not
thinking
about
it
but
rather
hanging
out
with
your
friends
yet
another
40oz
budget
beer
sure
why
not
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
head
that
disappears
quickly
smells
very
faintly
like
corn
syrup
tastes
a
weak
corn
syrup
flavor
slight
citrus
bitterness
thin
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
cheap
beer
for
a
cheap
buzz
if
that
is
what
your
looking
for
otherwise
go
elsewhere
i
was
helping
wcudwight
paint
and
we
sent
my
wife
out
with
the
instructions
to
bring
back
12
of
whatever
was
the
cheapest
this
was
the
winner
only
because
they
were
out
of
pbr
like
any
other
macro
it
smelled
like
a
mash
tub
at
a
moonshine
still
the
color
was
light
straw
and
little
head
the
taste
was
bearable
cold
mouthfeel
was
average
for
the
style
cold
this
beer
really
hit
the
spot
when
i
was
hot
as
hell
not
a
beer
to
drink
by
a
fireplace
with
snow
on
the
ground
but
a
summertime
work
beer
it
is
overall
the
beast
has
its
place
in
the
world
of
beerdom
typical
cheap
beer
there
are
better
choices
in
the
category
of
inexpensive
american
lagers
taste
is
salty
you
thought
i
was
going
to
lick
my
armpit
too
for
comparison
sorry
to
disappoint
actually
it
might
not
have
been
a
bad
comparison
theres
a
light
sweetness
too
like
watery
corn
mash
and
dull
hops
a
bit
peppery
no
aftertaste
at
least
goes
down
easy
despite
the
badness
but
why
am
i
drinking
this
after
these
few
sips
i
want
to
throw
it
away
but
people
might
see
me
and
it
was
free
am
i
being
a
jerk
if
i
toss
it
who
cares
hey
they
have
rolling
rock
too
after
the
best
milwaukee
has
to
offer
tm
this
doesnt
sound
so
bad
beast
is
not
as
bad
as
people
think
it
is
just
because
its
cheap
doesnt
mean
it
has
to
be
bad
i
enjoy
the
taste
of
milwaukees
best
but
hate
that
my
friends
are
always
giving
me
crap
about
drinking
it
it
tastes
similar
to
mgd
just
not
as
smooth
its
really
not
a
bad
beer
it
has
a
good
color
for
a
lager
i
laugh
when
i
see
people
say
this
color
is
pale
like
its
a
bad
thing
lagers
are
supposed
to
have
a
pale
color
look
for
richness
i
would
pay
more
than
i
do
for
a
beer
of
this
quality
not
that
its
the
best
beer
but
for
what
its
trying
to
be
it
is
excellent
the
drinkability
of
this
cheapo
beer
is
pretty
low
high
life
is
almost
the
same
price
and
tastes
ten
times
better
this
stuff
isnt
even
worth
the
1
59
i
paid
for
it
d
not
bad
actually
much
better
than
i
expected
not
a
tasty
beer
by
any
means
mind
you
but
there
arent
a
lot
of
off
flavours
or
anything
im
embarrassed
to
admit
but
this
is
the
beer
that
started
it
all
for
me
during
my
high
school
years
this
was
the
beer
of
choice
for
me
and
my
friends
1
99
for
a
six
pack
and
a
package
store
that
didnt
bother
to
card
16
and
17
year
olds
was
heaven
for
us
back
in
the
mid80s
i
decided
to
try
this
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
and
try
to
capture
some
of
that
nostalgia
the
beer
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
large
head
that
went
away
quickly
i
purposely
gave
it
a
vigorous
pour
smell
was
of
corn
vegetable
matter
and
adjuncts
pretty
lousy
taste
was
equally
lousy
very
watery
with
no
body
or
flavor
other
than
a
strong
adjunctveggie
taste
no
hop
flavor
detected
and
i
could
barely
taste
any
trace
of
malt
how
did
i
stomach
this
stuff
for
so
many
years
and
in
so
much
quantity
never
again
lord
help
me
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
very
thin
and
watery
the
beer
maintained
its
drinkability
as
long
as
the
beer
was
cold
a
very
difficult
beer
to
suck
down
drinkability
gave
me
a
headache
and
a
hangover
afterwards
spend
a
few
bucks
more
and
get
some
budnatty
lite
instead
color
wasnt
that
bad
yellowish
light
gold
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
evaporated
about
as
fast
as
my
enthusiasm
for
this
beer
smell
was
a
little
skunky
and
kinda
veggie
like
taste
was
not
very
distinct
watery
and
plain
and
nothing
redeeming
this
is
definitely
towards
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
of
ultra
cheap
mass
produced
american
lagers
d
i
made
it
through
one
of
these
and
stopped
this
beer
is
purely
for
the
frugal
drinker
wanting
to
catch
a
buzz
i
wont
drink
this
crap
anymore
smooth
and
a
no
brainer
a
very
inexpensive
brew
and
good
quality
for
the
price
if
all
you
desire
is
a
watered
down
beer
to
serve
at
a
backyard
bbq
goes
well
with
ribs
and
rich
foods
appearance
is
a
sort
of
light
watered
down
yellow
not
neon
bright
like
bud
more
an
offyellow
like
highlife
only
watered
down
smell
wasnt
too
good
im
not
sure
exaclty
what
i
smelled
but
it
wasnt
really
beer
there
was
alcohol
in
there
thats
the
only
scent
i
could
identify
taste
wasnt
too
great
either
thin
sickly
sweet
plus
you
can
definately
taste
the
can
no
hop
character
at
all
but
considering
the
hops
a
beer
of
this
price
must
use
that
can
only
be
a
good
thing
and
something
else
not
quite
sure
what
not
much
of
the
bitter
chemical
kind
of
adjunct
i
found
with
bud
or
highlife
but
theres
something
else
a
little
off
in
this
beer
like
the
yeast
was
sick
and
stunted
or
something
or
maybe
that
was
the
missing
hop
character
anyway
mouthfeel
was
definately
overcarbonated
drinkability
could
have
been
worse
i
didnt
have
to
supress
the
urge
to
gag
or
anything
but
even
like
18
assorted
beers
shots
and
mixed
drinks
in
the
hole
this
didnt
make
me
want
another
and
thats
really
saying
something
anything
less
than
completely
terrible
is
usually
delicious
once
im
that
acclimated
having
finished
this
beer
i
popped
open
a
cold
budwieser
afterwards
thereby
continuing
my
string
of
bad
drink
decisions
but
that
was
actually
worse
by
a
lot
this
beer
seems
to
be
not
very
beerlike
but
only
moderately
offensive
the
bud
being
bud
is
actually
a
little
more
beerlike
but
definately
tasted
worse
now
somehow
this
rating
worked
out
to
better
than
coors
light
dont
believe
that
i
dont
consider
coors
light
good
for
much
of
anything
but
if
it
comes
down
to
the
silver
bullet
and
the
beast
an
unconverted
and
unapologetic
macrolover
like
in
those
macro
lagers
around
can
provided
amid
a
bunch
of
stuff
given
to
me
for
volunteering
at
2005
gabf
uhm
thanks
guys
i
really
appreciate
the
opportunity
stamp
on
the
bottom
of
the
can
reads
12255
e11889
pours
a
1
12
finger
white
head
that
settles
really
fast
the
beer
is
clear
and
light
straw
in
color
smells
almost
like
water
very
weak
iron
honey
and
cardboard
tastes
not
so
good
the
malt
sweet
is
mild
and
i
think
there
is
a
soured
grain
character
in
there
hop
flavor
is
strong
compared
to
the
strength
of
other
flavors
in
this
beer
it
comes
across
as
dark
and
oily
and
doesnt
mix
well
with
the
overly
strong
carbonation
upon
the
swallow
there
is
a
nice
melon
sweetness
rounding
about
naer
the
tonsils
the
aftertaste
is
acrid
carb
on
the
tongue
and
ironish
malt
catfighting
with
the
hops
light
body
and
im
glad
this
review
is
over
i
drank
a
mbest
light
just
before
this
beer
and
think
the
light
version
is
much
better
than
the
regular
i
guess
it
may
be
that
the
flavors
in
the
light
are
so
subdued
that
they
cant
be
offensive
pours
a
very
clear
pale
straw
one
finger
head
has
about
a
30
second
lifespan
and
no
trace
of
lacing
corn
and
grain
aroma
that
doesnt
hide
the
sweet
estery
alcohol
smell
the
same
adjuncts
make
up
most
of
the
flavor
with
a
mild
alcoholic
bite
and
no
sign
of
hops
the
lightish
body
and
heavy
carbonation
fail
to
buffer
the
taste
of
harsh
alcohol
and
adjuncts
astringent
and
tangy
sweet
finish
for
casual
drinking
on
a
budget
the
ice
or
light
versions
of
milwaukees
best
are
far
superior
but
that
still
not
saying
much
aah
its
a
beaut
a
true
campers
beer
would
compete
for
the
smashthecanonyourhead
award
unlike
most
beers
you
have
to
drink
at
least
four
of
them
to
decern
any
flavors
at
all
a
powdery
cornlike
flavors
some
other
vegetable
and
grain
characteristics
but
in
too
low
of
detection
to
identify
quite
metalic
in
taste
and
feel
overcarbonate
equals
sandpaper
on
the
toung
light
hop
detection
aids
in
drying
and
leaves
the
mouth
void
of
flavor
or
body
i
like
this
beerit
makes
me
appreciate
other
beers
d
honestly
unless
i
was
drunk
already
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
more
than
one
of
these
if
you
serve
it
ice
cold
its
got
a
chance
but
let
this
baby
warm
and
youre
in
for
a
sour
stomach
if
its
free
ill
think
about
it
not
one
ill
ever
part
with
cash
for
theres
better
macrogarbage
out
there
so
let
the
beast
pass
you
by
drinkability
it
is
cheap
priced
because
it
is
cheap
you
pay
for
what
you
got
in
my
case
i
bought
just
a
single
one
for
that
review
and
it
will
probably
be
my
last
one
damn
this
is
swill
never
liked
this
brew
pours
out
to
a
cheap
yellow
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
notes
of
corn
and
a
metallic
like
odor
were
noted
taste
was
consistant
with
smell
i
would
recommend
many
other
beers
over
this
as
if
you
are
buying
this
you
are
1
in
college
2
broke
or
3
an
alcoholic
with
a
fetish
for
shitty
beer
go
with
old
milwaukee
instead
not
recommended
pale
yellow
color
very
thin
white
lace
for
a
head
very
think
bodied
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
smells
like
grains
and
cooked
corn
the
taste
might
as
well
not
exist
watery
with
some
sweet
corn
faint
hops
and
grains
kind
of
hard
to
drink
but
gets
the
job
down
when
people
want
to
beer
bong
at
a
frat
party
thank
goodness
i
live
in
my
fraternity
house
because
i
would
probably
never
get
to
review
this
bad
boy
otherwise
paid
2
89
for
a
sixer
of
16
oz
cans
i
dont
know
if
ive
ever
paid
less
for
that
much
beer
milwaukees
best
is
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
soapy
head
retention
is
nonexistant
the
aroma
is
typical
of
the
average
adjunct
lager
however
probably
less
sweet
smelling
than
most
there
isnt
much
here
to
talk
about
this
beer
has
all
the
bad
tastes
of
adjunct
lagers
without
some
of
the
possible
good
flavors
of
grains
or
mild
sweetness
this
is
pretty
tasteless
which
probably
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
you
can
do
a
lot
better
for
a
lawnmower
beer
spend
the
extra
50
cents
or
dollar
and
get
a
pabst
product
it
certainly
takes
some
hubris
to
call
your
beer
milwaukees
best
when
your
brew
is
perhaps
the
most
offensive
commercially
available
beer
a
little
surprised
too
that
miller
puts
their
logo
on
these
cans
just
knowing
that
miller
knows
how
to
make
this
beer
makes
me
reconsider
purchasing
their
other
beers
drinkability
despite
being
nasty
i
find
these
things
easy
to
drink
great
session
beer
this
beer
is
almost
as
clear
as
water
it
has
a
slight
yellow
tint
to
it
absolutely
clear
the
carbonation
looks
to
be
quite
active
a
decent
sized
blanket
of
white
sits
on
top
the
aroma
is
actually
pretty
good
grainy
and
sweet
just
a
little
corn
but
not
overdone
as
in
some
macros
the
carbonation
is
just
a
little
too
jacked
up
makes
drinking
a
little
tougher
than
it
should
be
the
flavor
profile
is
grainy
and
sweet
like
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
cereal
is
noted
as
well
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
barely
deceptible
overall
better
than
i
remember
from
my
college
days
12
ounce
can
sampled
yeah
now
we
are
livin
large
only
cost
me
60
cents
in
that
beer
rip

known
as
grand
central

in
nyc
duane

also
has

for

a

the
expected
light
pissy
yellow
medium

head
snow
white
nose
of

very
light
bodied
and
quite
watery
next
to
no

or

noted
crisp
and
cleansing
of
the
palateslight
metalic
note
only
decent
on
a
very
hot
day
another
fraternity
staple
smells
of
alcohol
and
grains
without
any
character
very
light
slight
sweetness
but
gets
very
dry
and
bitter
high
on
the
carbonation
as
well
the
bite
and
general
bitterness
make
this
one
of
the
tougher
swillers
still
its
price
will
keep
it
alive
on
the
party
scene
for
good
im
sure
just
dont
drink
it
willingly
well
not
that
it
matters
but
again
all
the
beast
products
are
for
frat
boys
and
getting
mass
amounts
of
people
drunk
they
do
the
job
and
they
do
it
well
for
10
a
30
pack
it
gets
the
job
done
no
matter
what
people
say
beast
will
always
have
a
place
in
the
hearts
of
americas
youth
and
for
that
i
tip
my
hat
to
them
for
the
price
its
not
a
bad
buy
if
you
have
money
to
spend
then
stray
away
from
this
beer
it
has
an
almost
sweet
taste
to
it
very
carbonated
but
goes
down
pretty
easy
this
beer
is
definitely
not
good
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
horrible
its
mostly
the
broke
mans
beer
overall
its
not
too
bad
for
the
price
and
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
when
my
wallets
looking
a
little
thin
canned
how
appropriate
most
bad
beers
i
try
to
think
of
something
interesting
or
witty
to
make
the
experience
worthwhile
however
this
beer
is
so
worthless
it
is
not
worth
the
effort
straw
color
with
tiny
bubbles
and
a
thin
white
head
no
lacing
musty
weak
hops
aroma
thinbodied
and
anemic
with
barely
any
flavor
and
what
is
there
is
not
pleasant
you
shouldnt
even
be
able
to
make
something
this
low
quality
with
malt
hops
and
water
the
fact
that
there
is
an
aftertaste
is
distressing
because
it
is
not
an
appealing
experience
never
again
overallbeast
light
is
better
overall
this
is
awful
i
see
many
people
scoring
it
high
because
they
have
memories
of
it
in
college
well
im
in
college
and
this
beer
still
sucks
no
matter
how
often
i
drink
it
a
cheap
horrible
beer
to
be
drank
in
high
quanities
for
a
quick
buzz
thats
it
this
mouthfeel
and
the
beer
is
under
carbonated
that
would
be
a
good
quick
and
cheap
way
to
improve
this
beer
drinkability
is
better
than
awful
lots
of
better
cheap
beers
to
drink
in
the
spirit
of
always
saying
something
nice
it
is
better
than
busch
drinkability
if
one
beer
makes
me
queezy
ive
either
got
the
stomach
flu
or
a
beast
in
my
hand
but
anyway
this
is
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
and
being
a
college
boy
ive
had
a
couple
pints
here
and
there
it
tastes
like
dogpiss
and
looks
like
it
too
no
buzz
whatsoever
and
after
a
while
its
just
a
chore
to
drink
if
you
want
a
cheap
college
beer
go
for
the
pabst
or
naturalkeystone
ice
ices
are
never
a
bad
choice
but
lights
are
just
disgusting
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
less
than
average
it
has
a
pale
malt
scent
with
the
addition
of
adjuncts
it
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
from
hops
and
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
horrible
it
is
tasteless
and
bland
it
has
no
character
and
doesnt
even
refresh
it
has
decent
mouthfeel
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
less
than
average
lager
it
has
little
flavor
and
less
aroma
its
one
and
done
for
me
overall
pretty
awful
tasteless
like
bud
rice
and
corn
present
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
nasty
greasy
finish
on
the
palette
drank
straight
from
the
cans
from
a
marketing
standpoint
i
would
guess
that
they
are
trying
to
impart
a
sense
of
royalty
by
making
the
cans
red
and
gold
but
it
just
reminds
me
of
drinking
an
old
mans
beer
taste
is
so
full
of
adjunct
and
skunk
that
it
is
hard
to
get
anything
else
out
of
it
do
not
buy
this
stuff
get
40s
instead
they
are
just
as
cheap
and
not
as
bad
as
this
crap
i
know
that
milwaukees
best
isnt
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
the
beer
is
also
know
as
beast
it
poured
a
putrid
yellow
with
no
foam
head
whatsoever
the
smell
is
very
grainy
and
corny
the
taste
however
isnt
half
bad
while
it
is
nowhere
near
average
it
is
better
that
some
other
more
expensive
macros
bud
especially
in
fact
i
find
the
taste
to
be
the
same
as
a
coors
feels
crisp
but
flat
in
the
mouth
but
is
very
refreshing
was
mowing
the
lawn
today
so
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
for
2
50
and
i
thought
very
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
for
a
swealtering
hot
day
not
for
sitting
around
a
pub
god
my
friends
and
i
use
to
drink
this
stuff
all
the
time
for
12
00
a
30
pack
i
guess
you
cant
go
wrong
when
this
stuff
is
poured
out
it
is
a
nice
yellowish
color
to
it
it
has
no
aroma
at
all
and
as
for
the
taste
it
tastes
like
an
aluminum
can
the
hops
in
this
beer
you
dont
even
no
exist
it
is
defiantly
a
cheap
beer
with
no
flavor
or
character
at
all
as
for
why
they
call
it
the
beast
i
guess
it
comes
from
two
things
first
the
horrible
taste
and
the
nice
hangover
you
get
after
drinking
this
beer
i
must
admit
a
certain
positive
prejudice
here
since
i
am
a
milwaukee
native
who
worked
at
miller
brewing
many
years
this
brand
was
an
old
gettleman
label
way
back
when
a
staple
at
colleges
milwaukees
best
is
more
affectionatly
known
as
beast
the
reason
for
this
is
quite
simple
it
sucks
the
color
is
unimpresive
taste
is
ungodly
when
it
is
anything
but
icecold
evenwhen
it
is
cold
i
find
it
difficult
to
drink
in
big
gulps
overall
hey
its
cheap
its
swill
and
it
aint
all
that
bad
has
a
surprisingly
good
taste
to
it
if
youre
feeling
like
slumming
it
go
ahead
and
grab
a
case
this
beer
is
a
very
light
yellow
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
that
leaves
quickly
the
nose
is
quite
offensive
with
a
grassy
smell
the
beer
tastes
very
watery
the
corn
is
prevalent
throughout
the
entire
beer
drinkability
is
low
for
this
beer
the
only
thing
going
for
milwaukees
best
is
the
price
but
it
is
probably
too
high
at
3
85
for
a
6
pack
of
16oz
cans
time
for
a
real
beer
but
before
i
leave
the
beast
behind
let
us
contemplate
the
phrase
on
the
label
below
the
lie
premium
beer
classic
taste
at
its
best
it
brings
to

pure
crap
im
trying
to
find
the
write
words
for
this
stuff
the
head
was
pale
thin
fuzzy
and
awful
the
color
was
an
ugly
yellow
off
white
tone
the
body
was
very
thin
like
water
with
bubbles
the
taste
was
that
of
a
light
beer
gone
wrong
watered
down
beer
flavor
with
a
tinny
aftertaste
not
really
refreshing
but
almost
heavy
in
taste
to
make
you
feel
blotted
leave
this
stuff
alonekwakdec

with
a
thin
graininess
the
beer
had
a
very
thin
body
from
a
complete
lack
of
malt
sweetness
only
corn
sweetness
was
present
grainy
its
obvious
one
can
consume
many
of
these
in
a
short
period
of
time
an
excellent
beer
for
beer
pong
plain
and
rather
tired
hops
and
places
where
old
guys
named
stan
hang
out
to
be
honest
though
i
just
cant
find
it
on
the
other
hand
it
was
cold
and
wet
the
main
thing
going
for
it
is
price
its
cheap
consume
it
as
cold
as
possible
freeze
your
taste
buds
this
was
my
first
beer
sadly
has
to
be
served
ice
cold
just
to
get
it
down
now
back
in
the
day
some
friends
and
i
went
to
visit
another
guy
who
went
away
to
college
this
stuff
was
everywhere
all
the
dorm
parties
frats
dives
long
story
short
ice
house
is
a
totally
forgetable
beer
however
the
timesi
had
drinking
it
were
wicked
pissah
no
words
for
this
swill
cheap
server
cold
otherwise
it
tastes
a
bit
like
rusty
water
could
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
harsh
grainy
adjunct
lager
cheap
dirty
its
not
trendy
nuanced
or
lovingly
crafted
dont
let
it
warm
up
and
drink
it
from
a
snifter
but
for
what
it
is
i
think
its
great
and
ill
buy
it
again
particularly
at
were
here
to
respect
beer
so
lets
not
call
things
awful
that
are
simply
out
of
fashion
feels
like
i
threw
up
and
havent
gotten
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
yet
good
drinking
beer
crisp
very
enjoyable
price
is
awesome
this
and
keystone
ice
are
my
favorite
ice
beers
pretty
rough
stuff
definitely
better
choices
out
there
a
terrible
beer
its
my
grandfathers
favorite
and
ive
had
more
of
these
than
i
care
to
admit
its
an
awful
beer
overall

this
stuff
will
get
you
hammered
fast
thats
not
my
goal
personally
as
im
more
of
a
connoisseur
than
a
drunk
however
icehouse
drinks
a
little
better
than
some
macro
tall
beers
but
not
very
many
better
than
keystone
ice
by
a
nose
and
now
the
alcohol
is
taking
effect
great
best
out
of
the
tall
macros
natty
ice
sorry
millercoors
cheap
above
5
and
not
as
offensive
as
some
of
its
peers
but
by
no
means
tasty
i
used
to
drink
this
in
college
i
hope
i
never
have
to
drink
it
again
my
1st
beer
i
ever
bought
at
21
thank
god
i
grew
up
to
better
beers
shit
house
more
to
the
point
thos
beer
was
an
okay
beer
for
a
cheap
beer
the
taste
was
not
that
bad
but
it
was
not
the
best
tasting
beer
the
aroma
was
just
ok
as
well
i
personally
would
pick
another
beer
over
this
one
but
that
is
just
me
but
for
a
cheap
beer
like
i
said
it
was
just
ok
o
a
little
better
than
i
remember
but
still
in
no
way
good
its
tolerable
not
a
bad
higher
abv
economy
beer
5
5
but
the
flavor
is
not
that
harsh
nothing
that
good
or
bad
about
it
a
decent
get
the
buzz
on
ice
lager
edit

appearance
is
really
excellent
for
this
beer
i
cant
think
of
another
aal
that
has
a
better
long
lasting
head
and
the
lacing
is
rather
superb
for
a
beer
of
this
type
icehouse
gah
ill
finish
it
though
im
just
grateful
that
there
is
no
taste
to
develop
a
taste
for
o
i
refuse
to
bash
any
beer
but
i
will
say
this
is
not
what
i
would
choose
to
drink
but
in
a
pinch
it
will
do
alright
it
is
what
you
would
expect
from
macro
breweries
the
taste
has
the
same
notes
as
others
to
me
it
was
drinkable
and
as
i
said
will
work
when
you
are
in
need
of
some
refreshment
overall
this
was
drinkable
but
not
exceptional
in
any
way
a
decent
brew
for
the
price
overall
it
tasted
like
licking
the
inside
of
a
metal
freezer
hence
the
name
i
guess
if
it
aint
the
house
youre
wearin
a
blouse
for
what
it
is
this
isnt
half
bad
though
quite
bland
overall
there
is
maybe
a
bit
more
hop
character
than
than
the
average
aal
and
its
cheap
enough
its
smooth
compared
to
a
typical
malt
liquor
and
as
strong
as
the
weaker
varieties
of
that
style
there
are
worse
beers
out
there
and
though
i
probably
wont
seek
this
out
again
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
either
o
this
is
nowhere
nearly
as
bad
as
the
51
beer
advocate
is
giving
it
while
its
not
a
good
or
even
solid
beer
its
better
than
the
bmcs
and
far
better
than
the
natty
and
keystone
level
beers
icehouse
is
a
brew
that
is
brewed
by
miller
brewing
co
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
5
5
and
it
pours
out
dark
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
i
like
the
color
of
this
brew
it
is
not
to
dark
but
not
too
light
the
smell
is
grain
malts
and
some
hops
it
has
the
smell
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
the
taste
is
bold
with
flavor
but
it
is
refreshing
and
smooth
you
pick
up
on
grains
and
malts
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
this
is
one
miller
brew
that
i
really
like
mouthfeel
is
bold
but
clean
i
will
get
this
brew
again
overall
im
giving
icehouse
a
4
out
of
5
icehouse
bought
from
sterks
grocery
in
hammond
in
when
i
was
a
youngin
outstanding
this
is
why
you
must
seek
local
brew
compassionate
brew
makes
for
better
brew
local
mkes
it
fine
however
if
your
looking
for
a
cheap
beer
that
will
get
you
drunk
in
short
order
than
this
is
for
you
smc
definitely
not
a
good
beer
but
one
i
feel
very
nostalgic
about
due
to
it
being
the
preferred
choice
of
friends
during
college
higher
abv
than
many
other
macrobrews
adult
soda
when
i
need
a
lot
of
light
refreshing
beer
ill
always
go
with
this
guy
overall
this
beer
has
a
decent
woodysmoky
flavor
up
front
the
finish
however
is
harsh
and
dry
it
leaves
a
prickly
dry
feeling
in
the
mouth
its
certainly
not
the
worst
or
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
the
price
is
right
on
this
beer
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
o
not
a
terrible
beer
i
like
it
better
then
a
lot
of
aal
beers
plus
it
comes
in
the
40oz
format
which
is
convenient
its
also
got
another
abv
point
at
5
5
then
most
aals
king
of
the
bank
accountfriendly
icebeers
cheers
overall
i
like
it
most
people
dont
but
oh
well
its
5
5
percent
alcohol
decent
flavor
on
mouth
and
its
a
all
around
go
to
beer
for
me
beings
its
from
miller
ugh
o
overall
this
is
a
rather
poor
beer
the
fusel
alcohol
is
horrendous
in
this
plus
the
wine
taste
i
used
to
drink
this
beer
alot
when
i
lived
in
minnesota
i
would
stick
a
few
cans
in
the
snowdrift
to
get
them
ice
cold
when
grilling
it
seems
to
taste
best
when
the
beer
is
near
freezing
it
has
a
crisp
taste
and
seems
to
have
more
carbonation
than
most
beers
not
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
its
light
and
goes
down
easily
for
the
price
13
99
a
30
pack
where
i
live
this
beer
is
good
it
better
then
most
in
the
same
price
range
has
a
strong
apple
cider
taste
with
a
sour
after
taste
some
metallic
taste
from
can
i
believe
aftertaste
goes
away
quick
really
a
smooth
taste
for
ice
brew
style
non
watered
down
has
what
i
call
ok
drinkability
not
top
dollar
but
not
the
worse
overall
this
brew
has
a
good
balance
between
cleancrispness
and
actually
having
some
flavor
its
got
more
flavor
than
most
beers
in
the
category
without
being
too
fruity
or
sweet
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
end
of
moderate
and
just
about
right
in
my
opinion
onot
bad
for
the
style
of
course
i
enjoy
the
taste
of
beer
period
so
its
tastes
like
beer
to
me
its
got
above
average
abv
points
for
that
a
decent
choice
if
you
want
to
slum
it
for
a
day
and
someone
else
is
buying
overall
a
decent
aal
option
ubiquitous
and
cheap
6
99
for
a
12
pack
in
my
area
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
amazing
could
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
would
not
highly
recommend
seeking
it
out
you
realize
why
this
beer
is
so
inexpensive
one
you
taste
it
this
brewery
spent
no
time
or
effort
making
a
good
tasting
bee
pousrs
clear
yellow
with
a
thick
soapy
head
that
fades
quickly
this
beer
is
very
grainy
corny
and
cheap
corn
all
the
way
through
the
nose
and
into
the
taste
cheap
grain
cheap
malts
decent
carbination
its
just
a
very
cheap
tasting
beer
its
only
purpose
is
getting
drunk
overall
while
there
are
much
better
brews
out
there
icehouse
is
better
then
i
was
expecting
not
really
offensive
and
rather
easy
drinking
with
an
even
little
bit
of
bitter
hop
working
its
way
into
the
taste
o
you
know
what
youre
getting
when
you
buy
a
case
no
surprises
here
their
is
so
much
better
ways
to
get
drunk
thin
head
on
a
brownish
gold
body
which
slightly
hazy
aroma
of
stale
honey
grains
and
tropical
fruit
this
beer
is
just
awful
its
mostly
sweet
and
barely
has
any
malt
or
grain
flavor
making
it
more
like
old
apple
juice
than
even
just
a
bad
beer
moderate
to
high
carbonation
basically
tried
it
for
the
review
i
understand
not
all
beers
are
good
but
they
should
at
least
be
drinkable
to
some
extent
well
its
icehouse
brewed
below
freezing
is
that
even
possible
o
while
this
is
probably
the
worst
tasting
beer
i
can
think
of
it
does
remind
me
of
college
and
having
a
good
time
it
is
higher
in
alcohol
than
your
average
beer
so
i
view
that
as
a
plus
this
beer
should
only
be
consumed
when
there
is
nothing
else
left
o
not
terrible
another
good
one
if
youre
short
on
cash
but
wants
lots
of
beer
it
is
what
it
is
o
overall
an
off
flavored
adjunct
that
provides
no
frills
1
0
d
i
dont
know
how
they
got
this
up
to
5
5
without
having
any
flavor
in
this
amazing
overall
even
for
a
cheap
beer
in
a
big
can
this
is
not
too
good
its
obviously
light
and
somewhat
thin
but
crisp
and
with
a
bit
of
smoothness
to
it
its
not
quite
creamy
but
almost
the
price
could
go
down
a
lil
bit
its
pretty
high
down
here
in
indiana
overall
you
cant
go
wrong
with
an
ice
cold
icehouse
it
is
what
it
is
a
cheap
ice
beer
nothing
special
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
it
started
out
pretty
well
but
the
taste
was
not
much
to
speak
of
the
beer
is
amazingly
clear
with
a
white
head
clean
aroma
with
a
strong
corn
character
some
grainiess
and
a
bit
of
yeast
very
simple
flavor
as
well
no
hop
character
or
anything
but
a
clean
flavor
and
moderate
sweetness
better
than
i
had
remembered
overall
i
dont
really
see
the
appeal
to
ice
beers
i
definitely
have
had
worse
but
this
just
was
not
a
great
beer
to
drink
whatsoever
dont
be
tempted
by
the
1
50
price
tag
spend
that
extra
2
and
get
a
bomber
of
fat
tire
instead
overall
pretty
rough
stuff
here
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
3
beer
that
has
been
iced
to
death
to
create
a
measly
few
abv
degrees
not
alot
of
flavor
and
the
flavor
there
is
not
tasty
and
very
metallic
there
are
better
cheap
beer
options
than
this
just
about
anything
but
dont
take
my
word
for
it
just
read
a
few
reviews
universally
awful
and
not
to
be
purchased
unless
youre
a
glutton
for
punishment
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
head
smells
of
corn
and
other
malt
that
is
about
it
tastes
of
bland
malt
that
is
it
a
little
taste
of
alcohol
but
nothing
too
bad
and
has
some
fullness
to
it
definitely
goes
down
smooth
for
a
light
bodied
beer
but
carbonation
seems
a
tad
heavy
overall
a
below
average
beer
infidel
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
i
drink
this
and
i
am
immediately
taken
back
to
my
days
before
i
was
of
legal
drinking
age
if
you
dont
have
a
choice
and
you
are
forced
to
drink
this
than
it
is
pretty
good
but
living
in
the
wonderful
world
we
do
and
being
of
legal
drinking
age
thank
god
this
isnt
something
i
have
to
be
forced
to
drink
if
you
are
going
to
drink
this
make
sure
it
is
cold
ice
cold
overall
very
very
good
much
more
of
a
bold
and
flavorful
brew
than
i
suspected
it
was
only
1
for
the
bottle
the
only
bone
with
this
beer
i
have
to
pick
is
the
very
noticeable
metallic
flavor
overall
not
sure
why
i
bought
this
i
think
it
was
to
amp
me
up
for
the
craft
brew
that
followed
it
steer
clear
o
not
bad
for
what
it
is
best
served
ice
cold
overall
this
isnt
the
worst
ice
beer
ever
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
its
cheap
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
this
wouldnt
be
ever
be
my
first
choice
for
a
beer
but
in
the
category
in
offers
things
other
dont
such
no
metallic
off
notes
and
not
off
applelike
yeast
notes
o
not
offensive
not
good
it
is
what
it
is
no
desire
to
really
drink
it
no
real
taste
overall
horrible
id
much
rather
have
a
lionshead
rolling
rock
or
high
life
d
a
surprisingly
decent
adjunct
lager
id
certainly
drink
this
over
pbr
or
other
similar
swill
if
forced
t
choose
probably
a
good
value
at
its
price
point
o
not
my
favorite
aal
probably
not
something
i
will
buying
again
in
the
future
o
ive
enjoyed
icehouse
so
many
times
that
it
was
interesting
to
actually
review
it
critically
for
me
icehouse
is
my
happy
place
of
affordable
macros
super
sessionable
cheap
and
available
everywhere
im
astounded
by
the
low
ratings
that
other
bas
give
this
beer
i
have
only
had
icehouse
once
before
about
8
years
ago
from
a
keg
at
a
halloween
party
at
the
university
of
toledo
obviously
i
had
come
to
this
party
armed
with
some
natty
light
so
i
really
dont
remember
tasting
the
icehouse
anyways
i
was
at
krogers
today
and
noticed
a
6pack
for
4
29
thought
i
might
be
nostalgic
to
be
honest
i
have
had
worse
its
for
sure
got
that
grainy
corn
taste
but
you
could
do
worse
i
can
kick
back
and
drink
a
6
of
this
get
a
good
buzz
and
thats
bout
it
for
the
price
i
recommend
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
if
you
can
afford
better
no
need
to
bother
o
perfect
representation
of
the
the
style
on
the
other
hand
it
is
terrible
considering
every
beer
in
this
style
is
a
perfect
representation
of
this
style
ill
give
it
a
2
and
tell
you
to
avoid
it
not
bad
for
a
cheap
drunk
though
overall
this
beer
is
just
below
mediocre
there
is
nothing
special
it
is
easy
to
throw
a
handful
of
these
back
on
a
hot
day
but
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
personally
would
spend
money
on
well
apparently
the
beer
ice
wars
that
spanned
the
49th
parallel
back
in
the
90s
have
left
some
stragglers
no
surprise
there
what
we
have
here
is
then
a
remnant
of
a
bygone
era
out
of
place
but
not
out
of
our
collective
consciousness
bloody
hell
pours
a
golden
color
with
super
thick
head
that
eventually
thins
to
a
lace
standard
putrid
adjunct
aromas
goes
down
smooth
like
water
a
hint
a
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
with
a
little
bit
of
that
ice
beer
alcohol
flavor
overall
this
beer
is
standard
adjunct
crap
but
if
your
into
ice
beers
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
this
beer
is
not
all
that
bad
not
great
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
if
money
was
an
issue
and
i
was
looking
to
buy
a
12
pack
of
something
cheap
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
this
or
if
i
went
to
a
friends
house
and
this
was
my
only
option
to
drink
i
would
not
hold
it
against
my
friend
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
does
have
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
taste
to
it
o
good
drinking
beer
for
mass
quantities
but
not
alway
tolarable
d
not
undrinkable
but
i
wont
be
hunting
icehouse
down
anytime
soon
i
couldnt
detect
the
5
5abv
tag
reminds
me
of
coors
light
or
just
about
any
other
american
adjunct
lager
overall
it
is
what
you
are
looking
for
in
an
american
lager
to
me
it
cheap
and
gets
the
job
down
overall
drinkability
maybe
its
the
bud
ice
i
just
had
but
this
beer
does
seem
to
be
suprisingly
complex
for
the
style
reminds
me
of
a
german
pilsner
maybe
a
watered
down
warsteiner
very
watered
down
icehouse
takes
me
back
to
my
younger
days
bar
hopping
icehouse
isnt
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
as
far
as
everyday
run
of
the
mill
beers
go
it
aint
bad
it
has
a
little
more
bite
than
some
other
beers
of
the
same
caliber
the
color
is
clear
yellow
there
is
nothing
really
great
about
the
smell
and
like
i
said
there
is
just
a
little
extra
bite
to
an
otherwise
bland
flavor
all
in
all
ill
drink
an
icehouse
from
time
to
time
you
could
do
worse
24
ounce
tallboy
with
icehouse
on
the
side
in
huge
letters
this
beer
looks
like
it
means
business
golden
lager
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
dissolves
pretty
quickly
tons
of
carbonation
sweet
corn
and
toasted
grain
aromas
odors
are
a
little
faint
sugary
malty
vegetable
taste
becomes
crisper
and
tangier
as
it
warms
but
retains
a
good
flavor
overall
you
get
what
you
pay
for
i
guess
very
clear
pour
resulting
in
a
two
finger
head
of
pure
white
thick
foam
that
lasted
about
three
minutes
and
left
a
broken
but
clinging
lace
the
color
is
a
4
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
yields
a
slight
aroma
of
floral
with
a
overtone
of
roasted
wheat
corn
and
rice
followed
with
the
sweetness
of
malt
the
taste
is
a
little
harsh
and
unbalanced
yet
sort
of
appealing
with
wheat
and
corn
flavor
in
the
lead
and
undertones
of
cooked
rice
and
just
a
shave
of
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
a
little
over
carbonated
but
what
it
short
on
smoothness
it
makes
up
in
zing
not
a
bad
cheap
beer
that
will
cool
you
down
after
a
hard
day
in
the
yard
or
sports
not
something
you
want
to
drink
warm
heaven
forbid
but
a
solid
after
a
hard
day
of
work
beer
icehouse
is
not
exactly
an
award
winning
beer
but
it
is
beer
than
natural
light
icehouse
is
a
little
darker
golden
than
your
standard
american
adjunct
lager
there
is
not
much
to
smell
but
grains
same
with
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
can
be
a
bit
bitter
thanks
buddy
overall
not
bad
tasting
but
very
bland
in
general
like
most
of
these
types
of
beers
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
little
to
no
head
on
it
smell
is
pretty
faint
maybe
some
grain
not
a
lot
to
speak
of
taste
is
not
good
but
not
too
bad
again
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
ass
just
a
bit
of
malt
flavor
and
some
grains
coming
through
very
light
mouthfeel
goes
down
pretty
easy
there
are
definitely
worse
beers
out
there
this
was
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
its
pretty
cheap
so
if
youre
looking
to
get
drunk
this
would
get
the
job
done
if
you
somehow
cant
afford
schlitz
this
will
do
as
such
i
give
a
schlitz
about
icehouse
this
is
a
beer
you
buy
when
you
want
a
cheep
party
beer
poured
a
dark
gold
colour
with
a
bonewhite
head
that
comprised
about
a
third
of
the
glass
it
smelled
sweet
metallic
and
like
corn
it
has
high
carbonation
the
taste
has
some
corn
in
it
but
mostly
it
tastes
like
bread
and
a
bit
metallic
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
too
that
i
like
its
not
a
particularly
harsh
bite
its
probably
partially
due
to
the
carbonation
and
that
metallic
offnote
but
its
there
its
got
a
bit
of
a
starchy
flavour
to
it
as
well
despite
being
watery
thats
what
i
like
about
this
beer
its
a
waterbeer
for
sure
but
despite
that
it
still
tastes
like
liquid
bread
and
its
got
a
5
5
alcohol
content
this
is
my
goto
beer
for
a
budget
beer
my
only
problem
with
it
is
that
it
doesnt
taste
fresh
something
about
it
tastes
old
and
stale
its
probably
due
to
that
metallic
taste
thats
no
bueno
but
all
in
all
i
like
that
good
old
bread
and
water
taste
drinkability
i
suppose
if
you
want
to
get
trashed
this
beer
is
a
winner
but
not
really
for
someone
with
a
discerning
taste
basically
this
beer
is
for
trashy
college
kids
overall
like
i
said
to
fans
of
real
beer
this
is
an
awful
beverage
but
as
a
cheap
beer
probably
meant
to
be
drank
en
masse
it
does
its
job
to
the
letter
than
nothing
more
honestly
not
an
awful
experience
just
nothing
remarkable
in
any
way

a
clear

with
a
half
inch
white
head
not
much
of
any
head
retention
or
lacing
aroma
is
very
very
weak
but
i
can
smell
some
corn
and
grain
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
slight
metallic
taste
noticable
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
thin
and
a
bit
watery
with
decent
carbonation
overall
i
just
dont
like
this
brew
even
for
the
style
of
beer
this
is
its
not
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
out
there
it
was
a
chore
just
to
finish
the
can
for
1
39
i
think
i
paid
too
much
for
this
the
appearance
is
just
like
any
other
tasteless
busch
beer
the
smell
is
horrible
and
the
taste
is
like
drinking
beer
that
has
gone
bad
for
like
ten
years
overall
this
beer
tastes
like
dirt
mixed
with
carbonated
water
it
seems
like
it
was
only
brewed
for
underage
drinkers
and
homeless
people
who
just
want
to
get
drunk
please
avoid
this
beer
sam
adams
and
fat
tire
is
where
it
is
at
i
had
picked
up
this
a
week
or
two
ago
while
i
was
out
and
wanted
more
beer
6
16
oz
for
4
75
saw
the
last
one
in
my
fridge
and
figured
i
would
review
it
while
i
had
the
chancebc
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
d
harsh
and
watery
musty
and
not
enjoyable
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
it
looks
and
smells
very
average
has
a
nice
flavor
and
drinks
well
the
higher
alchohol
content
adds
to
its
allure
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
it
is
not
watery
like
most
american
beers
wish
they
carried
it
at
our
golf
course
i
would
drink
more
feel
is
in
stride
with
the
smell
and
taste
a
touch
of
citrusy
grain
helping
it
along
fairly
good
drinkability
given
the
lack
of
challenges
and
decidedly
better
than
that
beer
30
i
had
last
night
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
too
much
carbonation
harsh
to
drink
a
terrible
beer
and
a
drain
pour
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
looks
like
every
other
macro
lager
but
even
lighter
and
more
watery
foamed
up
nicely
left
no
swirling
not
much
of
a
smell
but
what
is
there
is
slightly
floral
mostly
corn
tasted
like
metal
and
corn
not
much
beer
taste
at
all
but
a
metallic
unpleasant
after
taste
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tried
but
it
is
certainly
bottom
tier
smells
of
some
sweet
corn
and
some
floral
notes
tastes
much
the
same
maybe
some
hop
extract
in
there
somewhere
theres
not
that
much
going
on
here
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
and
moderate
drinkability
d
good
cheap
beer
i
would
say
a
malt
liquor
light
and
its
good
for
when
you
are
broke
and
wanna
get
drunk
but
hate
natural
ice
beer
3
during
swill
tour
2010
it
pours
a
clear
urine
topped
by
an
uberuriney
few
fingers
of
white
suds
the
nose
is
only
malt
husk
though
i
think
i
can
get
some
cashews
in
there
too
it
aint
bad
just
not
good
the
taste
makes
me
unhappy
maybe
some
wheat
corn
whatever
flavors
elicit
images
of
personalityless
folks
in
bowler
hats
seriously
this
is
one
lazyass
beer
folks
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crispish
finish
yeah
this
is
pretty
meek
it
aint
all
that
bad
just
its
the
wallflower
at
the
party
whos
all
really
shy
and
when
that
decentlooking
gal
over
there
asks
him
to
dance
i
assume
out
of
pity
or
something
he
stutters
and
wets
his
pants
fleeing
in
even
greater
ignominy
than
usual
yeah
this
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
fading
lacy
foam
on
the
surface
the
smell
is
light
on
the
nose
there
is
a
light
malty
sweetness
on
the
nose
and
and
a
slight
corn
smell
in
the
back
other
parts
of
the
nose
have
a
mineral
like
aroma
there
is
a
bit
of
a
spice
aroma
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
followed
swiftly
by
the
corn
syrup
flavor
which
to
its
credit
isnt
that
potent
there
is
a
slight
souring
from
the
cheap
hops
there
is
a
granola
like
husk
taste
throughout
its
not
really
that
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
just
as
weak
as
i
would
expect
you
could
probably
drink
this
if
you
want
a
cheap
beer
other
than
that
im
relatively
indifferent
with
this
beer
absolutely
the
worst
beer
in
my
opinion
very
rough
taste
and
bitter
after
taste
persistently
exist
after
every
swallow
color
seems
non
existent
can
not
hold
flavor
from
the
second
the
cap
is
cracked
no
refreshing
qualities
in
my
opinion
about
this
beer
1
39
a
tall
boy
at
my
local
cvs
i
dont
why
when
im
looking
for
a
cheap
beer
i
seem
to
pick
this
one
its
not
good
in
any
way
ive
seen
other
reviews
stating
the
aroma
and
taste
of
over
cooked
grains
kinda
cabbagey
all
true
its
good
for
a
quick
buzz
or
to
finish
off
a
night
of
drinking
but
thats
about
it
i
would
pick
this
over
a
bud
ice
but
then
again
thats
not
saying
much
is
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
almost
no
head
smells
like
over
cooked
grain
tastes
like
it
too
watery
in
the
mouth
and
all
i
can
say
it
is
possible
to
drink
but
whether
or
not
you
would
want
too
other
wise
if
you
want
american
macro
this
isnt
it
to
me
tough
to
get
down
tastewise
with
something
that
smells
awful
alcohol
is
there
not
much
else
maybe
some
ample
carbonation
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
thing
it
is
kinda
heavy
for
an
adjunct
lager
dont
look
for
any
hops
at
least
some
beers
just
taste
like
water
this
tastes
like
bad
water
and
alcohol
pass
if
you
love
horrible
hangovers
this
is
the
best
beer
you
can
have
icehouse
is
cheap
and
really
should
not
be
drank
by
anyone
who
considers
themselves
a
beer
connosseur
if
you
are
a
21
year
old
poor
college
kid
this
is
amazing
beer
if
you
are
not
this
is
a
skunky
brew
i
remember
the
days
when
an
ice
house
can
24
pack
was
considered
a
splurge
off
my
regular
diet
of
natural
light
this
beer
is
watery
and
skunky
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
this
bad
boy
will
give
you
the
worst
hangover
ever
but
its
really
not
that
bad
to
drink
d
overall
this
is
something
of
malt
liquor
light
better
than
some
adjuncts
and
good
enough
for
what
it
is
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
actually
quite
drinkable
the
taste
isnt
offputting
and
it
doesnt
make
you
want
to
pour
it
out
its
light
enough
and
refreshing
enough
that
you
can
put
away
quite
a
few
of
them
this
beer
smells
metallic
and
corny
it
tastes
like
cream
corn
and
malt
feels
bubbly
and
goes
down
easy
harder
to
drink
as
it
warms
for
the
price
itll
do
the
trick
not
bad
when
youre
paying
99
cents
for
a
24
oz
everyone
has
their
own
opinion
about
what
a
beer
should
be
even
within
its
own
style
icehouse
is
to
my
palate
not
something
that
should
be
consumed
i
typically
review
beers
at
room
temperature
since
i
dont
usually
mind
the
taste
at
room
temperature
and
in
some
beers
actually
prefer
it
at
room
temp
icehouse
is
harder
to
swill
than
most
cheap
beers
while
not
so
bad
as
milwaukees
best
ice
and
some
others
it
doesnt
have
many
redeeming
characteristics
the
aroma
is
very
metallic
and
almost
overwhelmingly
that
of
corn
instead
of
barley
malt
there
is
barely
any
hop
character
if
at
all
the
main
redeeming
quality
of
this
beer
is
its
price
point
which
admittedly
for
my
area
at
least
is
hard
to
beat
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
strohs
and
other
inexpensive
ice
beers
from
the
24
fl
oz

aug0910ro8011023

on

26
2010
ah
yes
it
is
93
degrees
the
air
conditioner
is
not
installed
yet
and
i
needed
a
beer
this
was
perfect
for
such
an
occasion
with
its
pale
yellow
pour
overly
carbonated
head
skunky
aroma
and
vaguely
malted
but
fizzy
taste
as
a
craft
beer
it
cannot
compare
to
anything
but
for
a
day
like
today
it
was
perfect
thats
about
all
i
have
to
say
about
that
for
the
cost
this
beer
isnt
bad
it
has
a
nice
malty
taste
and
it
has
a
high
alcohol
content
so
its
good
for
getting
humans
completely
wasted
id
say
buy
this
beer
if
you
want
a
high
alcohol
content
lager
for
a
low
price
as
a
side
note
their
new
labels
look
pretty
cool
rjt
first
taste
was
of
cooked
corn
and
also
grain
i
was
shocked
at
how
light
it
felt
in
the
mouth
not
much
malthop
detection
kind
of
a
dry
finish
not
much
aftertaste
as
for
drinkability
its
a
good
swill
and
session
if
you
want
something
like
this
haha
for
about
a
year
this
was
my
dad
and
uncles
go
to
beer
here
in
arkansas
a
30pack
can
be
had
for
about
13
up
at
the
missouri
state
line
and
this
quenched
our
thirst
for
a
whole
summer
and
more
to
be
honest
im
partial
to
icehouse
and
find
it
to
be
better
than
or
equitable
to
most
american
adjunct
lagers
overall
one
of
the
most
unrefined
beers
in
my
opinion
forget
coors
icehouse
is
like
a
freight
train
coming
into
your
living
room
drinkability
not
a
bad
quaffer
at
all
but
one
to
enjoy
quite
cold
as
theres
nothing
to
be
gained
by
letting
it
warm
up
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
well
this
pretty
much
an
average
example
of
this
style
clean
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
without
much
retention
or
lacing
a
slightly
sweet
grainy
aroma
a
neutral
slightly
sweet
slightly
grainy
flavor
the
thin
watery
body
we
expect
from
this
style
this
is
as
drinkable
as
beer
flavored
water
gets
if
youre
going
to
drink
this
style
there
both
better
and
worse
examples
from
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
highball
glass
it
has
a
dark
golden
color
that
doesnt
really
appeal
to
me
the
smell
not
so
bad
if
you
swirl
in
the
glass
and
smell
it
actually
has
really
grainy
smell
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
its
class
of
beer
and
its
drinkability
is
not
so
harsh
if
you
can
get
over
the
taste
i
would
much
rather
drink
bud
ice
and
its
the
same
price
all
and
all
to
me
not
a
good
beer
tastes
just
about
the
same
clean
with
maybe
a
bit
of
stale
corn
grainy
taste
and
almost
the
slightest
hint
of
sweetness
that
tries
to
come
through
with
a
faint
metallic
very
thin
alittle
dry
somewhat
drinkable
but
even
for
a
lighter
beer
this
could
give
you
a
stomach
ache
or
that
bloated
feeling
some
cheapo
brands
tend
to
do
i
dont
see
much
of
a
point
to
this
beer
save
your
money
or
get
yourself
a
couple
decent
40s
so
i
tried
the
can
version
of
this
btich
you
know
what
it
was
exactly
the
same
well
it
didnt
smell
like
i
was
actively
haivng
my
face
farted
on
but
it
was
close
enough
the
qualities
are
the
same
as
my
bottle
review
so
go
there
for
the
few
details
i
give
d
i
had
two
i
mean
i
had
to
i
mean
im
had
too
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
many
of
these
good
beer
if
youre
looking
to
get
drunk
or
play
a
drinking
game
not
good
for
its
taste
purposes
but
easy
to
get
down
surely
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
unless
you
just
want
to
get
wasted
there
is
hardly
anything
to
offer
gold
to
light
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
and
flavor
is
pretty
much
grainy
and
bready
a
good
macro
beer
that
is
a
good
fit
for
any
type
of
outing
drinkable
and
smoooth
a
good
deal
at
13
00
for
a
case
of
bottles
i
would
recommend
and
would
purchase
again
my
buddy
rob
reports
that
its
considerable
better
if
you
can
find
it
in
bottles
d
a
beed
bar
but
inoffensive
flavor
and
very
affordable
price
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
i
would
only
drink
it
to
get
to
get
drunk
not
a
sipping
beer
but
it
gets
the
job
done
poured
out
of
a
can
into
a
glass
golden
color

white
bubbly
head
actually
left
some
lacing
smells
like
corn
and
grains
very
crisp
taste
bitter
grainy
smooth
typical
american
pilsner
little
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
vanishes
pretty
quickly
i
still
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
pils
because
of
the
abv
this
leaves
one
feeling
pretty
relaxed
cant
beat
the
price
30
for
15
note
the
scoring
in
this
review
is
based
on
the
style
of
industrial
lager
it
should
be
viewed
as
a
reflection
of
this
beer
in
comparison
to
other
cheaply
made
mass
produced
fizzy
yellow
beers
appearance
is
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
crisp
head
smell
has
a
corny
adjunct
aroma
and
not
much
of
anything
else
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
light
sweet
corn
and
mild
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
theres
not
much
going
on
here
just
a
easy
drinking
adjunct
lager
poured
from
a
24oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
corn
and
malts
taste
is
crisp
some
malts
corn
is
present
fairly
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
for
1
25
a
24
oz
can
i
cant
complain
at
all
drinking
this
at
almost
50
degrees
was
my
first
mistake
this
puppy
needs
to
be
consumed
at
the
coldest
possible
temperature
to
choke
it
down
sweet
with
a
noticeable
fruity
alcohol
presence
the
grains
are
fairly
husky
and
rough
and
there
is
not
really
any
hop
presence
to
balance
things
out
icehouse
is
a
pretty
typical
higher
abv
offering
from
the
macros
not
really
meant
to
be
enjoyed
for
the
flavor
but
makes
an
efficient
alcohol
delivery
system
not
much
to
say
about
this
one

a
run

avoid
plenty
of
better
adjucts
to
be
had
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
beer
and
i
am
presently
surprised
after
being
hooked
on
red
dog
im
strapped
for
cash
so
cheap
40s
for
me
i
didnt
think
this
would
fair
much
better
but
i
have
found
a
new
love
the
taste
is
nothing
special
but
it
does
wonders
after
a
hard
day
of
work
smell
is
pleasantly
sweet
and
nice
im
quite
fond
of
this
beer
and
will
most
definitely
purchase
icehouse
again
good
job
plank
road
the
mouth
is
a
little
thin
i
thought
thered
be
a
bit
more
carbonation
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
decent
refreshing
lager
nothing
harsh
about
this
at
all
some
buttered
bread
and
corn
flavor
is
about
all
im
getting
but
its
more
flavorful
than
any
of
the
other
bmc
lager
mainstays
not
bad
for
the
beach
but
i
most
likely
wont
get
this
again
d
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
easy
drink
when
its
a
hot
summer
day
so
it
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
i
like
this
beer
dont
think
it
deserves
a
d
though
maybe
c
out
of
a
forty
bottle
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
gold
color
the
onefinger
of
offwhite
head
retained
well
as
a
collar
and
left
impressive
lacing
in
sheets
the
aroma
was
distinctly
unpleasant
macro
grains
stale
grains
skunky
malt
and
wet
wood
the
flavors
were
no
better
dry
grainy
skunky
and
boring
the
mouthfeel
was
rough
and
a
little
slick
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
medium
i
was
not
happy
to
have
a
full
forty
of
this
to
deal
with
i
always
hate
to
fail
a
beer
but
this
one
sucked
in
several
categories
especially
the
flavor
one
that
matters
cheers
d
this
is
surprisingly
adequate
for
a
bargain
ice
beer
from
miller
easily
drinkable
and
inoffensive
its
not
a
good
beer
but
it
is
a
complete
beer
it
at
least
achieves
mediocrity
if
only
coincidentally
my
first
thought
was
that
the
big
boys
sure
can
make
a
pretty
beer
it
had
a
fluffy
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
the
nose
was
pretty
weak
with
a
mild
lager
sweetness
deep
down
but
it
was
not
readily
obvious
the
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
again
think
pretty
not
good
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
with
a
very
unobtrusive
flavor
on
the
tongue
in
fact
my
tastebuds
decided
to
take
a
break
at
one
point
and
wait
for
something
to
happen
it
never
did
the
finish
just
went
down
like
tap
water
this
was
not
an
evil
beer
like
many
that
i
have
tried
in
cans
it
was
simply
hohum
boring
d
but
for
the
carbonation
goes
down
easy
and
fast
overall
it
was
a
standard
for
my
roomate
in
college
so
i
crushed
my
fair
share
i
can
still
see
havin
a
few
now
theres
worse
beer
out
there
poured
a
12oz
can
into
my
sam
adams
perfect
pour
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
light
clear
straw
with
a
nice
2
inch
white
fish
eyed
head
leaving
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
canned
corn
a
bit
of
sugar
and
fresh
corn
the
flavor
is
right
up
the
same
line
the
is
definite
flavors
of
corn
an
odd
aspartame
sweetness
just
a
hint
of
of
grass
and
a
bit
of
booze
the
mouthfeel
in
my
opinion
is
the
saving
grace
for
most
aals
but
this
one
blows
it
it
finishes
overly
sweet
and
not
dry
at
all
i
like
my
aals
to
finish
really
dry
leaving
the
palate
wanting
some
more
this
one
completely
lacks
the
quality
if
it
wasnt
for
how
crappy
the
mouthfeel
is
this
would
be
a
pretty
average
macro
lager
drinkability
is
decent
you
can
kill
a
whole
case
of
this
stuff
in
a
matter
of
hours
with
friends
as
well
as
drink
it
for
good
times
otherwise
this
is
a
college
101
class
beer
for
the
student
masses
overall
id
give
this
a
d
its
a
step
above
a
malt
liquor
of
some
kind
but
youd
probably
be
better
off
sticking
to
a
malt
liquor
than
this
stuff
a
pretty
average
beer
for
a
low
price
im
in
college
so
sometimes
its
all
i
can
afford
poured
out
of
bottle
into
a
normal
pint
glass
there
is
some
head
but
it
fades
rather
quickly
with
literally
no
lacing
at
all
the
smell
is
of
any
light
beer
although
this
one
isnt
the
taste
is
about
the
same
as
the
smell
very
light
followed
by
the
alcohol
not
much
here
but
its
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
was
visiting
in
south
carolina
and
picked
up
a
can
in
the
grocery
store
i
didnt
get
to
pour
into
a
glass
so
not
sure
about
the
appearance
the
smell
was
very
good
and
the
taste
was
refreshing
i
had
only
one
but
wished
that
i
could
have
had
several
normally
i
like
a
more
complex
taste
but
on
that
warm
day
it
hit
the
spot
perfectly
d
as
with

for
the

i
was

to
gag
on
this
one
i
had
never
tried
it
prior
to
this
tasting
not
much
of
anything
except
adjuncts
and
a
generic
lager
taste
but
its
not
thin
and
goes
down
decently
this
one
wasnt
made
to
taste
good
although
with
everything
it
could
be
bigger
and
bolder
the
flavor
features
malty
hints
this
time
along
with
some
other
sweet
notes
that
may
be
from
corn
or
another
cereal
grain
the
hop
notes
seem
to
be
limited
to
simple
bitterness
there
is
some
hint
of
astringency
at
the
end
as
well
that
is
kind
of
puckering
and
reminds
me
a
little
of

been
to

a
half
decent
macro
lager
and
for
ice
beer
it
is
not
half
bad
nothing
to
really
talk
about
vague
beer
flavor
no
real
characteristics
of
any
particular
kind
overall
cheap
beer
with
good
alcohol
content
nothing
fancy
expected
from
miller
rated
from
previous
tasting
notes
just
a
really
bad
beer
this
is
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
looks
way
better
than
youd
expect
and
it
pours
a
surprisingly
thick
and
creamy
head
it
actually
has
some
flavor
tasted
similar
to
pbr
to
me
but
not
nearly
as
good
kind
of
a
creamed
corn
taste
tastes
cheap
to
be
sure
but
it
could
be
worse
but
it
could
go
down
much
smoother
its
also
extremely
cheap
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
kids
in
college
who
just
want
to
get
drunk
it
is
the
milwaukee
beast
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
aal
that
ive
had
it
doesnt
have
that
offputting
finish
that
most
do
not
much
flavor
but
compared
to
others
in
its
class
pretty
good
badass
if
your
cheap
or
a
teenager
but
otherwise
cmon
man
lol
overall
1

i
gave
the
rest
of
the
12
pack
to
my
friend
and
he
left
the
three
slices
of
pizza
i
got
the
better
end
of
the
deal
we
are
not
huge
drinkers
so
he
got
six
cans
to
take
home
i
still
got
the
better
deal
i
never
expected
much
to
begin
with
but
this
is
truly
horrible
even
then
would
not
buy
again
not
even
for
2
a
12
pack
yeah
its
a
terrible
beer
tastes
like
miller
lites
reject
batch
from
experiments
gone
wrong
as
if
milwaukees
best
wasnt
bad
enough
this
kinda
like
a
sequel
to
a
bad
movie
as
far
as
cheap
beers
go
this
is
my
favorite
i
dont
expect
much
for
50can
and
this
one
surpassed
my
expectations
its
got
the
strongest
most
defined
flavor
imho
a
higher
alcohol
content
than
many
of
the
other
cheap
beers
so
its
great
for
a
party
but
also
really
easy
drinking
for
just
a
day
relaxing
i
dont
understand
the
piss
poor
ratings
for
this
tastewise
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
it
tastes
like
a
mixture
of
miller
light
and
malt
liquor
and
as
an
ice
brew
thats
practically
what
it
is
there
is
a
strong
grain
and
corn
taste
to
it
but
its
not
offensive
dont
let
it
get
warm
though
or
you
will
get
some
bad
tastes
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
for
my
taste
but
not
absurd
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
good
and
i
find
myself
actually
enjoying
them
milwaukees
best
ice
brewed
by
the
miller
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
5
9
this
beer
pours
out
of
the
can
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
taste
is
that
of
an
american
style
lager
and
malt
liquor
it
is
right
in
the
middle
of
the
two
the
beer
goes
down
ok
for
being
a
higher
abv
than
other
brews
on
the
market
nothing
bad
but
nothing
special
overall
i
give
this
brew
a
3
out
of
5
overall
overall
this
beer
is
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
its
a
party
beer
for
sure
a
cheap
option
that
you
can
buy
massive
quantities
of
for
little
money
i
got
a
32oz
can
for
1
70
and
used
it
to
wash
down
eight
chili
cheese
dogs
it
did
its
job
and
in
a
great
way
i
would
certainly
consider
this
for
a
college
kegger
with
that
said
semisharp
hop
smell
bitey
but
smooth
hoppy
mouthfeel
no
tracing
in
my
glass
when
i
poured
it
out
of
a
can
appearance
is
a
boring
typical
gold
color
doesnt
bother
me
though
ive
got
to
give
this
credit
its
cheap
and
it
cuts
to
the
point
at
5
9abv
its
kinda
noticable
but
goes
down
good
you
can
smell
the
grainsmalt
and
the
hint
of
alcohol
head
is
soapy
and
leaves
decent
lacing
i
know
lacing
really
i
will
give
it
a
full
swallow
beer
in
my
honest
opinion
it
will
get
you
where
you
want
to
go
this
beer
was
surprisingly
good
for
a
cheap
get
drunk
kinda
beer
it
has
a
clear
amber
red
appearance
there
is
a
this
malt
smell
it
has
a
malty
taste
with
a
dry
aftertaste
it
is
slightly
skunky
at
the
end
it
goes
down
pretty
hard
since
it
is
pretty
volatile
ive
had
worse
but
not
much
worse
the
corniness
seems
to
come
out
of
this
more
than
other
aals
ive
had
the
trace
of
alcohol
in
the
flavoraroma
confuses
me
the
flavor
is
too
heavy
on
the
corn
at
1
49
for
a
24oz
can
its
what
youd
expect
shitty
quality
but
it
is
pretty
drinkable
probably
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
again
though
i
will
say
that
the
price
is
hard
to
beat
for
the
abv
id
rather
have
this
over
a
bud
light
or
mostly
any
other
light
beer
for
sure
for
the
price
you
cant
really
go
wrong
very
clear
appearance
nominal
aroma
with
the
faintest
hint
of
malt
and
alcohol
a
very
crisp
taste
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
which
for
an
ice
beer
i
suppose
you
are
hoping
for
a
classic
drink
of
the
college
elite
taste
prett
crisp
with
a
light
body
some
hops
alcohol
comes
up
on
your
tongue
it
is
not
bad
for
an
ice
beer
at
6
99
at
12pack
but
does
not
up
to
par
stick
with

overall
2
5
its
a
lightbodied
underpowered
aal
what
did
you
expect
going
into
it
i
certainly
didnt
have
high
expectations
but
frankly
was
blown
away
by
the
appearance
if
nothing
else
everything
else
was
unimpressive
at
best
ride
the
beast
overall
this
beer
is
great
to
get
drunk
and
have
a
party
with
campfire
or
just
by
yourself
watching
uk
dominate
at
bball
overall
this
is
not
something
i
can
recommend
flavorless
iced
lager
1
5
d
bad
fucking
taste
therefore
try
it
yes
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
understand
brewing
but
there
are
times
when
you
want
cheap
beer
and
lots
of
it
like
at
keg
parties
bottom
line
is
the
people
that
give
this
beer
bad
reviews
wont
know
what
their
missing
until
its
gone
sure
i
enjoy
a
good
tasting
beer
occasionally
but
i
dont
want
the
best
to
dissappear
because
a
bunch
of
reviewers
felt
like
talking
smack
about
a
beer
that
they
didnt
even
understand
its
good
potent
and
cheap
and
it
doesnt
taste
too
bad
either
i
just
mentioned
four
positive
things
and
there
is
no
disputing
any
of
them
keep
this
on
the
market
and
ill
keep
buying
it
i
only
drink
the
best
its
good
to
buy
if
youre
having
people
you
dont
like
over
that
forgot
to
byob
or
the
alcohound
bros
are
over
and
you
dont
want
to
spend
a
fortune
as
the
provider
of
beer
for
the
party
it
has
enough
alcohol
to
kick
their
asses
and
leave
them
with
a
hangover
bad
enough
to
make
them
think
twice
before
they
mess
with
the
beast
again
unless
theyre
hardcore
bastards
then
they
probably
drink
this
on
the
reg
its
a
nice
can
of
beer
very
distinctive
it
has
a
good
head
and
good
carbonation
is
it
guinness
no
is
there
a
better
beer
you
can
buy
for
50
cents
a
can
no
does
it
fit
the
parameters
yes
5
9
alcohol
and
144
calories
its
like
drinking
two
beers
for
one
two
cans
of
light
beer
are
about
150
calories
and
will
probably
run
you
about
1
50
and
youll
still
only
get
about
6
0
alcohol
total
if
you
buy
the
30
pack
itll
last
you
a
month
im
disappointed
that
othe
reviewers
dont
see
the
value
of
this
beer
overall
could
do
worse
but
also
could
do
better
for
the
record
i
believe
that
miller
changed
the
recipe
on
this
beer
when
they
switched
to
the
current
label
circa
2010
i
emailed
miller
and
they
said
there
was
no
change
but
other
beers
of
the
same
ilk
have
left
the
same
impression
on
me
in
similar
circumstances
not
sure
what
the
appeal
of
this
one
is
it
seems
like
it
should
have
a
higher
abv
still
i
finished
the
can
me
and
2
of
my
friends
were
recently
sitting
around
having
a
slow
night
so
we
decide
to
go
on
over
to
the
good
ole
liquor
store
and
pick
up
a
30
pack
of
this
for
only
14
so
we
all
crack
one
open
with
no
smell
to
speak
of
a
decent
taste
along
with
a
decent
mouthfeel
as
we
tear
through
the
30
pack
we
all
start
to
get
drunk
at
a
fast
pace
if
there
is
one
thing
this
beer
is
good
at
it
is
getting
people
smashed
seriously
a
30
pack
of
this
could
get
6
or
7
lightweights
smashed
off
of
their
ass
no
it
isnt
particularly
good
tasting
but
im
not
a
beer
snob
pick
up
a
few
cases
for
a
party
of
15
and
i
can
guarantee
you
that
everybody
will
be
wasted
by
the
time
it
is
gone
overall
its
not
my
fav
for
the
cheep
lager
category
amongst
milwalkees
best
brands
i
prefer
the
light
its
funny
to
even
have
a
preference
on
this
sort
of
beer
but
hey
back
in
the
day
we
drank
a
lot
of
this
stuff
its
good
for
what
its
good
for
cheep
beer
very
cheep
this
one
is
fine
in
that
respect
im
not
entirely
sure
how
i
drank
so
much
of
this
in
college
its
not
awful
but
its
not
good
i
wouldnt
make
a
habit
of
picking
this
up
it
tasted
just
like
it
smelled
it
had
a
very
nice
old
man
beer
flavour
that
classic
bad
beer
taste
it
may
have
been
a
little
over
the
top
and
it
was
surprisingly
bad
to
pair
with
hot
dogs
probably
because
it
was
a
bit
too
boozy
for
that
but
it
really
wasnt
too
bad
the
taste
might
have
been
a
little
too
bold
but
often
times
i
like
that
in
an
adjunct
lager
i
dont
know
why
this
is
rated
so
badly
its
got
a
good

thoughts
well
i
got
to
say
or
something
like
that
not
really
lagerlike
as
a
poor
college
student
i
bought
this
beer
for
drinking
games
and
expected
nothing
it
was
disappointing
this
beer
is
so
bad
that
i
expected
nothing
from
it
but
it
still
managed
to
disappoint
drank
from
the
can
but
i
would
assume
it
looked
like
fizzy
swamp
water
because
that
is
what
it
tasted
like
the
smell
left
nothing
to
be
desired
but
it
could
have
probably
been
worse
the
taste
was
as
i
said
earlier
like
fizzy
swamp
water
this
is
the
epitome
of
piss
beer
in
fact
i
would
bet
that
this
beer
is
kidney
filtered
through
the
homeless
of
milwaukee
is
it
miller
time
not
if
beast
ice
is
involved
overall
a

college

are
more
likely
to
get

pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
short
head
and
no
retention
or
lacing
smells
of
an
adjunct
lager
definitely
fits
the
style
as
sad
as
that
is
crisp
feel
with
low
carbonation
weak
body
and
tastes
mostly
of
adjunct
overall
not
a
beer
for
anything
but
getting
smashed
it
is
a
bland
beer
as
a
whole
it
has
sweet
adjunct
aroma
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
in
the
aroma
almost
like
malt
liquor
it
has
a
very
watery
feel
to
it
the
flavor
is
also
watery
and
sweet
with
virtually
no
bitterness
at
all
the
can
states
the
use
of
quality
hops
i
just
want
to
know
what
quality
there
was
not
much
for
bubbles
in
the
body
but
there
was
a
lot
of
head
and
lace
it
is
a
good
party
beer
and
that
is
about
it
though
i
am
only
a
ripe
22
years
of
age
i
have
probably
have
at
least
90
of
the
beer
types
known
to
man
then
there
was
beast
ice
aka
milwaukees
best
ice
living
up
to
its
faithful
name
this
beer
is
quite
a
beast
and
i
do
mean
that
in
the
worst
way
possible
its
so
bad
it
doesnt
even
deserve
a
review
try
one
and
youll
know
what
i
mean
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
thin
body
the
carbonation
works
well
with
the
beer
and
may
actually
make
the
beer
better
this
is
just
another
pound
as
fast
as
you
can
beer
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
another
college
town
beer
that
is
more
of
a
tool
for
getting
drunk
than
a
real
beer
ice
beer
so
its
high
in
alcohol
and
low
in
taste
very
pale
and
little
to
no
head
retention
the
aroma
is
non
existent
no
good
characteristics
for
this
bland
flavorless
concoction
stay
clear
of
this
one
dale
why
i
like
this
i
cannot
tell
you
but
i
do
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
cheap
beer
perhaps
its
the
ice
brewing
aka
extra
alcohol
that
makes
this
one
extra
drinkable
very
sweet
very
corntasting
would
rather
drink
this
than
other
cheap
brews
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
big
billowy
head
that
dissipates
into
nothing
almost
immediately
smell
is
quite
nonexistant
taste
is
actually
nonoffensive
very
light
tasting
to
be
truthful
no
personality
but
not
godawful
mouthfeel
is
not
quite
as
thin
as
i
had
expected
easy
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
easy
going
nature
of
this
beer
its
weak
flavorless
and
watery
but
at
the
same
time
has
high
abv
and
is
nonoffensive
a
good
brokemans
party
beer
drinkability
is
very
very
low
i
refuse
to
drink
this
beer
anymore
even
when
its
free
and
in
copious
quantities
id
much
rather
pay
a
bit
extra
and
upgrade
to
miller
lite
or
almost
any
of
the
other
products
that
miller
brews
this
beer
poured
a
translucent
yellow
with
a
lot
of
visible
carbonation
and
a
singlefinger
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
smell
is
fairly
faint
with
some
whiffs
of
malt
and
maybe
some
corn
adjunct
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
malt
up
front
with
some
barely
perceptible
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
some
pretty
aggressive
carbonation
this
beer
is
basically
made
to
be
drank
in
large
quantities
by
already
inebriated
college
kids
and
hobos
i
wouldnt
get
this
beer
if
you
can
afford
anything
else
but
if
youre
seriously
considering
buying
this
beer
then
i
doubt
youre
really
looking
for
something
tasty

a

not
much
alcohol
on

nose
even
thought
its
an
ice
brew
it
comes
out
at
5
9
just
under
the
legal
limit
of
some
of
the
archaic
states
with
beer
laws
like
wv
flavor
unremarkable
but
yet
a
horrible
chemical
metallic
offness
comes
across
the
palate
with
dme
sweetness
after
a
few
sips
im
certain
im
not
going
to
finish
off
a
whole
24oz
can
i
will
not
waste
anymore
vibrant

on
this
beer
drain
pour
mouthfeel
is
thin
watery
textured
with
carbonation
so
high
it
makes
it
hard
to
swallow
shitty
industrial
beer
at
its
worst
drinkability
terrible
d
this
is
a
pretty
boring
beer
but
its
still
not
that
bad
considering
most
macros
and
further
more
american
ice
beers
this
one
is
a
notch
above
the
rest
d
for
the
price
5
for
a
12
pack
at
the
gas
station
this
is
eminently
drinkable
for
someone
on
a
budget
this
straddles
the
line
between
overboozed
malt
liquor
and
watery
lowabv
macro
brews
pours
a
pale
golden
color
and
has
a
decent
head
retention
with
a
nice
lace
smell
is
mostly
corn
but
i
can
detect
a
hint
of
malt
goes
down
pretty
and
is
very
dry
with
basically
no
bitterness
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
mostly
corn
but
does
have
that
ice
flavor
to
it
i
dont
care
for
adjunct
lagers
very
much
but
rating
this
with
the
style
in
mind
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
ahh
the
beast
for
what
it
cost
many
a
cans
were
devoured
by
myself
and
my
roomies
back
in
the
day
of
the
cheap
ice
beers
this
one
isnt
that
bad
it
has
that
pale
yellow
pee
look
and
that
bad
grainy
smell
but
the
taste
improves
after
the
first
few
sips
perhaps
there
is
rubbing
alcohol
in
there
and
it
sterilizes
the
tongue
and
the
body
is
almost
medium
there
are
some
malts
and
sweet
notes
of
rice
and
corn
to
taste
which
is
surprising
for
a
cheap
american
macro
ice
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
if
it
were
offered
to
me
even
if
it
made
me
appear
rude
but
it
is
not
a
horrible
pickup
swill
twelve
ounce
aluminum
can
color
of
pale
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
nose
of
grass
sweet
grass
lemon
white
rice
and
dry

taste
of
artificially
sweet
sour
and
rice
body
is
light
and
oily
and
with
medium
high
carbonation

aftertaste
of
sweet
and
bad
vegetation
the
beer
looks
ok
dark
gold
with
a
full
soapy
head
but
i
think
appearance
is
its
only
strongpoint
it
smells
like
metal
and
cheap
ingredients
old
musty
malt
and
wet
hay
it
tastes
like
any
cheap
malt
liquor
to
me
st
ides
or
olde
english
or
any
type
of
cheap
higher
alcohol
40oz
i
used
to
buy
when
i
was
young
and
broke
kind
of
heavy
and
not
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
bought
a
40oz
for
1
89
just
for
the
hell
of
it
i
probably
wont
again
clearly
not
the
best
beer
option
but
i
can
make
this
work
the
5
9
abv
price
tag
deserve
mention
if
i
want
something
that
taste
good
i
buy
blue
moon
normally
i
buy
busch
or
budweiser
for
a
nights
worth
of
drinking
when
im
broke
i
buy
beast
ice
less
than
six
bucks
for
a
12
pack
here
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
reason
i
dont
buy
it
more
is
because
at
5
9
abv
i
tend
to
regret
the
night
before
this
unfortunately
was
the
beer
i
grew
up
on
my
stepdad
drank
this
and
i
had
more
of
these
than
id
like
to
admit
without
a
doubt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
even
comparing
to
other
cheap
macros
the
higher
alcohol
content
isnt
enough
to
make
this
worthwhile
the
taste
is
just
horrible
i
cringe
just
thinking
about
it
the
only
way
to
even
attempt
to
drink
this
is
ice
cold
and
fast
even
then
it
is
quite
putrid
let
it
warm
even
a
couple
of
degrees
and
you
are
in
for
a
whole
mouthful
of
funk
avoid
at
all
costs
there
are
better
cheap
macros
to
get
you
drunk
i
bought
this
for
two
reasons
one
it
was
11
99
for
a
30
pack
two
its
5
9
abv
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
and
you
dont
care
about
taste
appearance
smell
having
a
horrible
hangover
and
feeling
like
crap
for
24
hours
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
otherwise
cough
up
a
few
extra
dollars
and
get
something
that
doesnt
taste
like
the
water
that
builds
up
at
the
bottom
of
a
trash
can
quaffed
a
few
of
these
on
the
golf
course
recently
i
guess
i
was
drawn
in
by
the
5
9
abv
and
the
price
was
certainly
right
pale
straw
in
appearance
no
noticeable
smell
slightly
sweet
in
taste
not
bad
but
not
great
overall
not
a
bad
macro
choice
on
a
hot
day
provided
ample
refreshment
and
booze
on
the
golf
course
eric
cheap
next
milwaukees
best
ice
has
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
well
maybe
it
does
but
not
in
the
context
of
this
hardfought
competition
it
doesnt
although
it
falls
just
a
wee
bit
short
in
the
flavor
department
its
a
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
in
a
pinch
icecold
of
course
not
a
bad
showing
miller
your
beer
is
still
clearly
superior
to
most
of
what
comes
out
of
st
louis
for
10
99
a
thirty
pack
this
beer
is
worth
every
penny
spent
it
is
very
economical
and
some
might
say
you
get
what
you
pay
for
but
for
a
cheap
macro
its
fairly
good
definitely
suitable
for
college
students
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
with
only
a
few
dollars
and
needs
to
pick
up
something
that
isnt
that
bad
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
for
a
macro
ice
strange
flavor
hints
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
but
i
think
this
is
a
cheap
beer
and
i
drank
a
lot
of
it
before
i
turned
21
24
ounce
tall
oil
can
light
golden
in
color
fizzy
and
sizzling
head
that
is
wiped
out
rather
quickly
pasty
malts
and
tender
grainy
hops
on
the
nose
for
the
style
no
complaints
here
fizzy
carbonated
malt
based

light
cooked
veggies
with
a
severe
warming
alcohol
backbone
palate
turns
grainy
yet
cleansed
with
slender
corn
flavorings
sweet
metallicacidic
finsh
for
the
style
not
too
bad
for
the
beer
advocate
worth
passing
up
steve
says
that
the
beast
sucks
no
excuse
for
a
beer
i
can
buy
that
but
since
i
was
low
on
funds
today
about
all
i
could
afford
was
milwaukees
best
ice
at
a
whopping
5
9
alcohol
by
volume
i
figured
that
after
two
or
three
i
could
forget
what
i
was
drinking
anyway
i
was
also
raised
to
believe
there
is
some
good
in
all
people
and
all
things
well
this
swill
really
put
my
upbringing
to
the
test
sure
i
got
drunk
but
getting
drunk
with
mb
ice
is
like
making
a
million
dollars
as
a
proctologist
for
rosie
odonnell
you
might
reach
your
goal
but
the
journey
is
far
too
unpleasant
for
most
i
give
this
beer
two
mugs
only
because
being
icebrewed
gives
it
more
of
a
punch
but
by
god
im
working
overtime
next
week
so
i
can
afford
something
good
i
rate
the
drinkability
low
because
i
couldnt
even
finish
a
glass
and
theres
still
more
in
the
can
it
may
be
very
drinkable
if
youre
just
looking
to
pound
back
a
few
and
get
fucked
up
and
if
you
also
dont
care
what
your
beer
actually
tastes
like
but
i
cant
consider
this
drinkable
in
any
way
this
is
milwaukees
best
im
sure
the
city
has
something
better
to
offer
than
this
swill
this
beer
though
not
great
is
probaly
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
that
you
can
find
a
highly
corny
taste
with
a
powerful
punch
and
low
cost
makes
this
the
beer
of
choice
for
those
looking
for
a
quick
buzz
at
a
low
cost
very
similar
to
natty
ice
yes
ive
been
slumming
a
bit
lately
poured
out
of
a
24
oz
can
into
a
styrofoam
cup
i
know
i
know
the
head
was
impressive
though
it
quickly
dissipated
into
a
dull
yellow
it
smelled
of
corn
with
a
hint
of
the
5
9
alcohol
the
taste
was
standard
macro
ice
fare
a
good
beertasting
beginning
denegrating
to
strong
metallic
and
alcohol
flavors
on
the
finish
its
not
a
horrible
beer
and
not
a
bad
accompaniment
to
tailgating
or
grilling
burgers
but
milwaukees
best
ice
isnt
a
beer
to
savor
hey
ya
know
id
say
this
si
the
benchmark
for
macro
ice
beers
its
got
the
flavor
of
mils
best
and
not
only
adds
the
extra
alcohol
but
i
think
does
a
better
job
of
masking
the
alcohol
than
keystone
ice
and
icehouse
for
example
serve
ice
cold
my
recipe
for
success
would
be
to
let
freeze
in
cooler
then
place
in
freezer
5
minutes
before
consuming
has
a
lower
freezing
point
than
normal
beer
because
of
the
extra
alcohol
pours
out
a
brassy
gold
with
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
up
top
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
body
smells
like
alcohol
grains
and
cooked
vegetables
this
does
have
a
sickening
alcohol
sweetness
corn
and
grain
quality
to
it
but
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
that
shines
through
at
the
end
so
i
give
it
kudos
on
that
note
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
slick
and
prickly
with
bubbles
just
sticks
to
my
tongue
i
hate
this
and
i
will
never
buy
this
again
high
gravity
malt
liquor
is
easier
going
down
wtf
miller
having
this
after
the
lucky
number
might
have
made
me
respect
it
more
than
i
would
normally
clear
gold
color
with
a
smallish
fizzy
head
head
dies
but
good
amount
of
bubbles
rise
smell
is
not
too
much
but
more
of
a
macro
beer
smell
taste
isnt
too
bad
not
really
any
off
flavors
a
touch
of
hops
combine
with
the
adjunct
malts
making
it
not
so
nasty
sweet
like
most
cheaper
beers
are
not
too
much
flavor
just
a
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
slightly
bitter
counterpart
body
is
lighter
alcohol
is
noticeable
on
the
tongue
but
doesnt
burn
fairly
drinkable
really
good
for
its
price
and
style
okay
so
my
candian
friends
had
some
of
this
stuff
and
i
had
heard
stories
of
the
beast
before
so
i
was
weary
i
was
thinking
5
9
ice
beer
and
remembering
the
horrid
taste
of
labatts
ice
so
i
cracked
one
open
i
smelt
hints
of
corn
and
malt
and
i
must
say
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
hey
for
the
money
its
defiinetly
worth
a
try
great
bargain
beer
and
at
5
9
it
gets
you
hammered
on
the
bright
side
if
you
are
poor
and
want
to
get
drunk
this
doesnt
taste
any
worse
than
regular
milwaukees
best
and
it
does
the
job
faster
milwaukees
best
ice
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
sixteen
ounce
can
very
mild
adjunct
aromas
tastes
like
corn
some
metallic
flavor
as
well
pretty
drinkable
for
a
cheap
ice
beer
decent
and
fairly
cheap
for
lawnmower
beer
otherwise
forget
it
not
bad
for
the
style
it
may
be
the
best
beer
i
have
had
in
a
24
oz
can
if
you
want
something
that
is
nonoffensive
and
easy
to
get
drunk
off
of
you
may
want
to
check
this
out
why
i
even
tried
this
to
get
drunk
of
course
milwaukees
best
ice
was
very
appealing
to
the
poor
mans
budget
with
5
9
alcohol
unfortunatley
the
taste
was
absolutley
horrid
i
would
drink
icehouse
over
this
when
its
ice
cold
it
isnt
completely
wretched
but
like
many
beers
of
this
style
when
it
even
thinks
about
warming
up
its
like
drinking
a
mixture
of
aluminum
and
carpet
cleaner
avoid
i
thought
i
was
done
with
the
beast
and
its
line
of
beers
from
my
days
in
college
guess
it
was
either
nostalgia
or
the
fact
that
i
am
flat
broke
but
i
bought
a
case
of
this
last
night
i
tried
one
and
about
23
of
the
way
through
it
i
poured
it
out
tonight
i
am
on
a
mission
after
almost
finishing
my
second
one
it
is
getting
less
and
less
painful
to
pour
this
down
the
ol
gullet
in
fact
it
doesnt
taste
that
bad
at
all
it
doesnt
taste
that
great
either
settle
on
the
stomach
a
little
heavy
though
thisll
do
bc
it
seems
like
it
gets
on
you
quick
with
a
buzz
if
i
had
my
druthersand
more
money
i
would
have
bought
something
much
better
but
at
10
dollars
a
case
you
cant
beat
it
for
when
you
looking
to
get
drunk
on
a
budget
what
is
there
basically
to
say
besides
that
it
is
a
party
beer
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
is
for
college
kids
on
a
low
budget
even
thought
he
commercials
beg
to
differ
and
say
its
a
real
mans
beer
not
true
the
only
reason
that
the
drinkability
is
at
a
2
5
is
because
once
you
drink
a
few
then
there
is
really
no
need
to
worry
aobut
taste
the
good
hting
about
this
beer
is
that
it
has
a
much
more
sharp
taste
than
its
sister
beer
milwaukees
best
light
the
flavor
is
not
far
from
what
the
nose
suggest
but
there
is
a
little
more
malt
than
you
might
expect
its
pretty
well
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
and
its
certainly
not
sweet
like
a
malt
liquor
the
generic
hops
return
though
only
lending
a
smear
of
muddled
flavor
where
there
could
be
so
much
more
to
give
it
interest
and
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
which
is
odd
as
its
only
5
9
by
volume
its
fairly
crisp
and
smooth
but
gets
watered
down
the
warmer
it
gets
taste
and
smell
make
this
much
harder
to
drink
than
any
other
american
macro
id
normally
rank
much
higher
for
drinkability
but
this
really
did
almost
make
me
feel
sick
even
regular
olde
milwaukees
beast
is
much
better
poured
a
pale
yellow
clor
with
initially
monstrous
white
puffy
head
that
was
very
quickly
gone
smell
is
so
light
as
to
be
virtually
nonexistent
with
a
mild
sweet
malt
present
and
no
hops
found
taste
is
very
light
but
some
alcohol
notes
to
be
tasted
finishe
is
refreshing
as
long
as
the
beer
is
cold
but
as
it
warms
it
becomes
less
enticing
ok
beer
but
a
bit
too
strong
as
a
spacer
d
ill
give
this
beer
a
good
score
in
this
category
simply
because
this
style
is
made
to
be
drinkable
however
comparing
it
to
other
macros
i
still
consider
it
quite
poundable
given
the
alcohol
content
the
drinkability
of
a
light
beer
and
the
low
price
its
the
perfect
buzzmaintainer
once
youre
too
hammered
to
care
about
what
you
taste
drinkability
well
for
a
quick
buzz
its
ok
but
id
rather
go
for
a
steel
reserve
i
think
it
tastes
better
and
with
a
higher
abv
its
preferable
i
dont
think
id
get
this
again
unless
i
was
really
in
a
fix
and
needed
the
buzz
this
is
my
first
macro
in
quite
a
while
even
though
i
bought
this
for
giggles
this
is
an
honest
review
of
the
beer
itself
i
strive
for
this
in
any
beer
that
i
try
pale
yellow
color
smell
is
a
weird
sugary
sweet
taste
is
flat
a
bit
sweet
no
hops
very
dull
thin
mouthfeel
i
know
why
i
drink
craft
beer
and
not
this
stuff
its
useless
for
beer
i
dont
consider
this
real
beer
i
might
throw
the
rest
out
since
i
bought
it
as
a
40oz
and
im
not
trying
to
impress
my
hommies
or
anything
i
only
spent
1
50
on
this
but
i
feel
bad
for
spending
that
much
on
it
presentation
packaged
in
a
sixteen
ounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
this
beer
poured
a
clear
pale
yellow
standard
macro
lagercheap
beer
color
a
small
head
formed
for
a
brief
period
again
nothing
exciting
strong
cheap
beer
smell
grain
and
corn
with
a
little
alcohol
the
taste
is
kind
of
metallic
with
grain
and
alcohol
nothing
special
but
not
horrible
either
mouthfeel
is
ok
fairly
watery
its
very
drinkable
24
ounces
for
99
cents
is
a
good
value
and
its
stronger
than
budweiser
but
id
avoid
it
if
i
had
more
money
good
clear
pale
apperance
with
bot
much
lace
the
smell
is
surprisingly
clean
also
this
tastes
nothing
like
regular
milwaukees
beast
which
is
a
good
thing
it
isnt
pretty
but
it
is
crisp
cheap
and
gets
you
drunk
watery
mouthfeel
fairly
drinkable
pours
pale
gold
crystal
clear
a
thin
and
bubbly
one
finger
head
remains
for
under
30
seconds
with
very
weak
lacing
the
smell
is
weak
for
an
ice
beer
corn
and
grain
adjuncts
with
no
hops
present
the
alcohol
is
finally
percieved
in
the
taste
but
is
not
so
strong
that
you
cant
still
taste
grain
and
aluminum
still
not
a
bad
flavor
for
its
price
its
also
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
bite
in
the
aftertaste
drys
up
quickly
leaving
a
crisp
mouthfeel
despite
low
carbonation
and
a
thicker
body
than
you
would
expect
in
a
macro
if
youre
a
fan
of
good
cheap
beer
remember
that
the
milwaukees
best
lineup
is
comparable
to
and
sometimes
cheaper
than
your
miller
high
lifes
and
pabst
drinkability
of
the
ice
cheapies
this
really
isnt
bad
and
compared
with
icehouse
or
the
tamer
malts
for
the
price
id
rather
have
a
high
life
still
okay
if
you
want
to
get
buzzed
cheap
this
is
a
cheap
beer
at
12
02
after
tax
for
a
case
it
is
the
cheapest
i
can
find
in
this
area
i
rate
everything
except
drinkability
at
3
0
because
i
dont
take
time
to
notice
nit
picky
bullshit
things
like
that
they
dont
matter
all
that
matters
in
a
beer
is
if
it
gets
you
drunk
and
drunk
i
am
5
9
alcvol
this
is
the
only
beer
i
drink
i
go
thru
about
6
cans
a
day
many
many
more
when
i
dont
have
to
work
in
the
monring
yes
im
an
alcoholic
and
i
find
it
exceptionally
drinkable
if
you
are
on
a
budget
or
just
dont
give
a
shit
about
anything
except
getting
wasted
this
is
the
beer
for
you
i
bought
this
for
5
99
a
30
pack
due
to
a
closeout
at
my
store
definatley
a
good
beer
to
drink
to
quench
your
thirst
but
it
does
seem
to
get
you
drunk
pretty
fast
5
9
abv
everytime
i
drunk
more
than
four
of
these
i
got
a
headache
i
dont
really
mind
the
tast
grainy
with
just
hints
of
malt
seltzer
water
i
have
never
been
so
confused
by
what
was
so
called
beer
it
just
confuses
me
on
how
some
business
could
make
a
beer
that
is
this
flavorless
i
would
recommend
this
to
college
student
or
a
person
on
a
extreme
budget
other
than
that
its
good
for
nothing
else
well
you
get
what
you
pay
for
here
a
good
appearance
for
50
cents
a
pop
the
six
was
three
bucks
not
all
that
bad
if
in
a
pinch
take
it
easy
boys
and
girls
save
me
this
is
complete
death
in
a
can
poured
out
to
an
average
golden
color
this
brew
hits
the
drinker
with
odors
of
alcohol
and
cooked
hops
carbonation
was
ok
but
a
touch
on
the
lets
add
extra
bubbles
to
cover
up
the
flavor
side
flavor
of
alcohol
and
malt
were
most
prevailant
finished
a
bit
dry
and
quickly
informs
the
drinker
that
if
they
do
not
change
brews
they
will
quickly
have
a
headache
from
hell
go
with
shlitz
ice
if
youre
looking
for
a
sub
premium
priced
ice
beer
much
better
flavor
value
etc
etc
not
recommended
this
is
a
terrible
beer
the
appearance
is
bizarre
its
the
only
beer
i
have
seen
with
a
yellow
greenish
color
like
lemon
gatorade
the
smell
is
awful
like
a
used
growler
that
hasnt
been
cleaned
out
the
taste
doesnt
really
have
any
recognizable
beer
characteristics
other
than
alcohol
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
finish
this
undrinkable
beer
stay
away
had
again
with
the
shit
beers
at
my
nieghboors
you
know
i
enjoyed
this
even
less
than
the
light
honesty
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
so
horribly
its
weird
5
9
abv
and
all
i
taste
is
alcohol
no
grains
hops
nothing
this
is
sheer
and
utter
crap
i
hate
beer
that
should
have
never
been
brewed
in
the
first
place
this
is
the
perfect
example
pours
almost
crystal
clear
with
no
head
and
lots
of
fizzies
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistant
the
taste
is
somewhat
metalic
and
has
a
strong
water
overtone
a
great
beer
for
someone
who
is
wandering
the
desert
other
than
that
bad
times
id
like
to
say
this
beer
looks
like
crap
seeings
how
it
is
the
beast
and
all
but
it
actually
looks
fairly
decent
with
a
golden
color
and
a
white
head
smell
is
almost
nonexistant
with
a
faint
adjunct
odor
detected
taste
is
very
faint
with
a
grainy
adjuct
flavor
that
builds
up
in
the
finish
very
light
bodied
not
much
different
than
water
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
but
so
is
waters
not
much
going
on
in
this
beer
but
it
has
some
alcohol
to
it
and
is
actually
not
the
worst
ice
beer
ive
ever
had
not
that
it
says
much
medium
straw
colored
super
size
head
that
has
decent
staying
power
collapses
and
then
brings
some
nice
lace
forget
about
everything
you
have
been
told
about
lace
nose
is
grassy
and
soap
like
some
off
scents
flavor
is
sugary
and
sweet
grain
is
dominant
but
not
much
syrupiness
finish
is
long
and
sweet
not
real
good
not
real
bad
pours
out
a
deep
gold
with
a
large
white
head
the
head
vanishes
almost
immediately
despite
the
large
number
of
carbonation
bubbles
however
the
residual
laces
with
great
gusto
the
nose
gives
a
scent
of
saaz
hops
but
intruded
upon
by
the
adjunct
aroma
the
taste
is
of
the
hops
and
adjuncts
as
well
the
feel
is
medium
with
a
good
deal
of
crispness
overall
drinkability
limited
by
the
lack
of
real
substance
in
the
taste
a
big
white
head
settles
to
a
14
ince
layer
before
nearly
disappearing
but
leaves
decent
lacing
oddly
enough
light
golden
gently
carbonated
liquid
sweet
adjunct
and
grainy
nose
clean
tasting
with
a
subtle
weakly
fruity
taste
in
the
background
with
some
hop
twang
present
finishes
sweetish
a
solid
and
decent
cheap
beer
is
what
we
have
here
first
things
first
lets
get
this
straight
this
is
a
beer
for
someone
wanting
to
get
very
drunk
for
very
cheap
10
dollers
for
30
beast
ices
and
its
5
9
this
beer
really
has
nothing
fantastic
about
it
skunky
smelling
almost
a
transparent
color
not
a
great
taste
light
in
the
mouth
about
the
only
thing
one
can
say
about
it
is
it
has
a
higher
abv
than
ice
house
and
it
tastes
just
slightly
better
well
maybe
a
lot
better
but
that
really
isnt
saying
much
if
you
are
budgeting
and
needing
a
drink
go
for
it
its
still
more
respectible
than
grabbing
wild
irish
rose
had
to
get
this
to
replace
a
keg
that
simply
could
not
be
procured
unfortunately
the
keg
was
going
to
be
of
saranac
pale
which
is
far
more
acceptable
the
appearances
is
light
yellow
with
a
huge
head
that
is
gone
almost
as
quickly
as
i
was
able
to
pour
it
the
smell
is
light
but
too
sweet
for
what
it
is
definately
you
can
smell
some
corn
and
al
the
rest
is
alcohol
taste
is
a
bit
of
wheat
and
some
metalics
with
an
overriding
salty
alcoholicness
it
goes
down
well
i
will
admit
and
i
find
that
this
isnt
actually
a
terrible
choice
when
the
choices
are
limited
plus
its
extra
alcohol
who
can
argue
for
a
party
poured
pale
yellowgold
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
counterintuitively
both
prevented
me
from
pouring
the
beer
all
at
once
in
my
glass
refusing
to
settle
quick
enough
for
me
to
continue
pouring
and
then
all
but
disappearing
once
it
was
all
in
the
glass
maybe
i
should
have
left
the
last
bit
in
the
can
if
id
known
it
was
a
head
retention
killer
smell
is
corn
with
very
little
malt
or
hops
sweetness
is
reminiscent
of
honey
almost
but
mostly
just
creamed
corn
the
taste
is
nondescript
except
for
the
corn
flavor
at
the
end
there
is
nothing
exciting
about
this
beers
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
quick
and
relatively
painless
that
much
can
be
said
drinkable
but
why
torture
yourself
drinkability

i
performed
this
tasting
over
my
sink
thinking
that
if
i
passed
out
the
giant
24
ounce
can
would
fall
down
in
the
drain
where
it
belonged
but
all
in
all
this
wasnt
that
bad
hell
i
might
even
finish
this
blue
and
silver
bullet
stay
away
from
this
brew
if
your
better
off
with
drinking
a
light
beer
than
this
simply
gross
an
econimcal
way
to
catch
a
buzz
is
all
this
is
taste
is
skunky
and
alcoholic
flavors
are
not
natural
for
beer
pale
yellow
in
color
with
head
that
is
not
impressive
tastes
just
awful
dont
buy
this
swill
your
tastebuds
will
thank
you
as
a
younger
man
i
regarded
mbi
to
be
the
worst
beer
made
its
not
but
its
in
the
running
good
clear
pale
apperance
with
some
lace
clean
aroma
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
quite
crisp
with
a
light
body
thin
on
the
malt
with
extremely
faint
hops
alcohol
shows
that
it
is
there
as
there
is
not
much
to
hind
behind
not
too
bad
for
an
ice
beer
at
5
99
at
12pack
its
a
bargin
dark
gold
clear
large
fizzy
white
head
with
some
stamina
some
metallic
quality
to
taste
very
light
flavor
overall
maybe
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
slightly
bitter
hightly
carbonated
some
softness
and
rather
watery
unbelievably
flavorless
even
less
than
many
light
beers
ive
had
ice
cold
and
with
a
blocked
nose
this
might
be
drinkable
but
for
79
cents
a
24
oz
can
i
suppose
you
get
what
you
pay
for
the
taste
is
evenly
balanced
but
does
not
finish
real
well
as
the
alcohol
becomes
evident
and
leaves
you
dry
drink
a
few
of
these
and
dont
even
think
about
driving
i
only
had
two
of
these
and
i
could
imagine
the
pain
id
be
in
if
i
had
a
12pack
or
even
a
6pack
if
youre
at
a
party
and
this
is
all
they
have
by
all
means
go
for
it
but
dont
drink
this
if
you
like
good
beer
already
half
in
the
bag
i
started
funneling
these
things
rank
skunky
odor
and
a
rough
flavor
made
it
hard
to
drink
any
other
way
this
is
just
not
right
i
could
make
out
the
piss
flavor
while
my
taste
buds
were
really
sleeping
if
you
know
what
i
mean
milwaukees
best
ice
if
that
ice
was
cut
from
an
outhouse
it
is
best
real
cold
left
outside
all
night
on
november
night
i
perfer
it
with
little
chunks
of
ice
swimming
in
it
real
bad
beer
but
a
good
way
to
get
loaded
it
stinks
like
corn
and
rubbing
alcohol
and
tastes
very
thin
and
highly
alcoholic
anyway
we
got
it
for
beer
pong
and
should
do
the
job
in
getting
people
all
druuunked
up
despite
the
nastiness
ill
probably
sneak
away
from
it
every
now
and
then
for
harpoon
ipa
surprisingly
good
for
beast
light
straw
in
color
with
fast
rising
bubbles
and
rich
head
almost
no
lace
slightly
malt
sweet
flavor
with
metallic
corn
and
cooked
veggie
flavor
surprisingly
this
works
pretty
well
not
a
bad
beer
when
drinking
just
to
wet
your
whistle
starts
with
plastic
then
goes
to
a
light
corn
with
a
hint
of
malt
colour
is
a
fair
amber
looks
are
so
misleading
here
some
unpleasant
sticky
palatability
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
if
you
need
this
beer
for
effect
then
go
for
it
hazmat
hazardous
material
teams
can
be
seen
unloading
this
stuff
from
the
beer
trucks
from
time
to
time
im
sure
once
you
get
past
the
first
few
cans
every
thing
settles
down
except
for
the
plastic
taste
that
never
goes
away
completely
darker
than
your
average
lager
with
a
slight
head
smells
like
crap
and
the
taste
isnt
much
better
it
is
better
than
regular
beast
but
what
does
that
matter
nice
alcohol
punch
some
smoothness
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
bite
in
the
end
a
beer
purely
to
get
drunk
fast
not
recommended
i
cannot
believe
i
drank
beast
ice
and
more
than
once
was
it
good
no
was
it
bad
no
this
beer
doesnt
have
that
miller
taste
like
the
rest
of
their
products
its
a
little
darker
slightly
than
i
expected
there
is
some
actual
taste
to
this
beer
that
for
some
reason
i
enjoyed
it
uneventful
to
say
the
least
but
the
gold
standard
of
the
beast
lineup
best
consumed
at
hunting
camps
with
guys
named
doug
pours
a
finger
of
sudsy
frothy
white
head
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
film
and
decent
spotty
lacing
clear
and
straw
colored
smells
of
cereal
grains
slightly
skunky
very
straightforward
bland
taste
with
a
short
bitter
hop
bite
slight
citric
tartness
and
notes
of
strawhay
in
aftertaste
feels
watery
with
higher
carbonation
taste
does
not
linger
at
all
not
that
id
want
it
to
overall
i
simply
cant
bring
myself
to
find
anything
really
pleasing
or
outstanding
about
this
macro
if
nothing
else
it
looks
good
decent
does
the
job
when
asked
it
is
mostly
grassy
sweet
with
some
just
a
hint
of
hops
bitterness
that
doesnt
last
or
bite
at
all
in
fact
none
of
the
flavor
lasts
or
really
asserts
itself
in
any
way
no
aftertaste
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
but
this
doesnt
come
through
in
the
taste
light
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
no
challenge
at
all
the
mac
and
cheese
of
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
a
bbq
but
im
not
going
to
be
the
one
to
bring
it
to
said
bbq
or
buy
this
unless
its
really
the
only
beer
in
the
one
local
store
out
in
the
middle
of
the
wild
very
good
overall
but
with
slightly
weak
smell
great
feel
a
great
beer
when
canned
for
all
day
ocean
fishing
trips
very
smooth
and
crisp
several
off
quality
batches
have
occurred
over
the
years
having
a
metallic
off
flavor
this
was
the
ultimate
hanging
out
beer
back
in
the
day
it
was
cheap
and
readily
available
served
in
a
mug
enjoy
this
one
always
gives
me
the
beer
farts
otherwise
harmless
and
not
truly
memorable
looks
good
stays
constant
better
taste
than
miller
lite
i
remember
drinking
a
lot
f
this
in
the
90s
now
i
ask
why
overall
people
who
desire
an
unbearable
feeling
of
bland
sensation
will
seek
miller
genuine
draft
as
a
confusing
compensation
horrible
you
take
the
first
sip
and
think
because
youve
spent
the
money
to
buy
a
beer
so
good
crisp
and
citrus
taste
gives
is
a
fresh
and
great
paring
beer
its
a
regular
draft
easy
to
drink
gets
points
for
appearance
is
crystal
clear
refreshing
slightly
boozy
adjunct
lager
nice
cold
straight
from
the
fridge
mainly
a
summer
drink
when
you
make
coors
look
good
your
doing
something
wrong
my
goto
beer
i
like
it
it
is
good
mgd
has
never
been
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
not
bad
once
in
a
while
at
a
party
more
watery
than
coors
and
thats
saying
a
lot
i
wish
i
could
rate
it
lower
absolutely
awful
tasteless
and
one
to
avoid
you
know
what
your
getting
of
you
drink
this
dominated
entirely
by
a
strange
mouthfilling
adjunct
fug
not
entirely
offensive
but
not
even
so
much
as
a
touch
of
grain
or
hops
pretty
ordinary
stuff
overall
thank
you
millers
for
living
up
to
my
expectations
this
is
a
pretty
nasty
and
boring
macro
lager
with
awkward
pungent
flavours
and
an
unsatisfying
and
watery
feel
worth
au44
a
case
not
nearly
its
not
the
worst
american
adjunct
lager
but
its
certainly
not
great
either
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
if
you
are
on
this
website
and
buy
this
beer
mgd
hits
the
spot
good
at
parties
miller
is
just
good
in
general
yeah
they
are
big
but
i
enjoy
miller
quite
a
lot
rating
this
against
the
style
this
is
good
stuff
should
not
that
i
dont
think
this
one
has
skunked
yet
as
i
did
get
it
in
milwaukee
and
that
helps
make
it
better
than
i
remembered
a
group
of
friends
did
a
cheap
beer
blind
taste
test
this
came
in
last
as
far
as
aal
swill
goes
it
is
by
far
the
easiest
to
choke
down
imho
overall
not
the
most
offensive
but
nothing
too
special
a
good
tailgating
brew
but
otherwise
not
a
go
too
typical
adjunct
lager
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
just
a
tad
more
malt
flavor
than
budweiser
overall
average
overall
not
good
that
is
all
i
can
say
the
taste
is
bland
and
the
finish
is
super
dry
terrible
smell
followed
by
terrible
flavor
that
has
an
evil
godawful
bite
to
it
avoid
at
all
costs
out
of
24
oz
can
smelled
of
adjuncts
but
was
a
good
smell
to
it
not
too
light
these
beers
such
as
pbr
rolling
rock
colors
miller
etc
almost
always
seem
to
leave
an
odd
dry
film
in
mouth
but
i
did
like
this
mgd
will
always
be
my
highest
rated
big
brewery
beer
when
i
was
young
miller
lite
was
my
go
to
beer
i
eventually
graduated
to
mgd
due
to
the
amount
of
taste
and
how
smooth
and
drinkable
it
was
i
do
tend
to
not
drink
it
anymore
because
if
im
out
partying
i
tend
to
go
to
miller
lite
because
it
is
easier
for
me
to
watch
my
alcohol
intake
but
its
really
awful
beer
truth
to
be
told
i
wouldnt
buy
this
on
purpose
in
a
scenario
short
of
the
zombie
apocalypse
once
in
a
while
a
friend
of
mine
will
offer
me
one
only
out
of
courtesy
will
i
drink
it
but
usually
give
it
away
another
beer
whose
fame
came
only
by
shoving
propaganda
down
the
throat
of
the
bluecollared
and
telling
them
that
this
is
what
real
men
drink
when
my
friends
request
that
i
pick
this
up
from
my
local
liquor
store
i
flat
refuse
to
buy
this
horrid
mess
of
a
beer
had
this
for
the
first
time
in
years
at
the
local
labor
day
picnic
for
what
its
worth
it
is
a
notch
above
miller
and
miller
lite
its
smoother
and
less
corny
for
some
reason
and
union
made
by
my
uaw
brothers
and
sisters
so
theres
that
not
sure
why
they
all
this
one
genuine
draft
taste
nothing
like
draft
too
me
has
none
of
the
sweetness
of
miller
high
life
i
actually
buy
these
and
coors
beers
i
rather
like
this
good
flavor
smooth
and
doesnt
leave
you
disappointed
i
drink
these
frequently
it
tastes
like
beer
smells
like
beer
and
is
high
quality
for
a
macro
good
show
miller
i
rather
like
this
beer
overall
a
3
is
given
to

from

i
am
not
biased
to
drink
and
review

supplying
this
brew
to
me
during

miller
genuine

by

this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
you
pick
up
on
grains
and
corn
the
look
and
smell
is
that
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
brew
so
far
the
taste
is
ok
you
pick
up
on
the
corn
in
this
brew
but
it
is
not
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
miller
genuine
draft
goes
down
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
25
out
of
5
this
is
not
the
worst
ive
had
but
not
the
best
i
would
get
this
brew
again
i
didnt
expect
much
and
got
what
i
expected
a
macro
brewed
adjunct
overall
the
massive
corn
adjunct
tastes
disgusting
never
again
this
was
the
beer
that
got
me
to
like
beer
i
didnt
care
for
bud
light
milwaukees
best
coors
pbr
or
any
of
the
other
bigname
generic
beers
out
there
they
tasted
like
waterdown
crap
i
remember
first
tasting
this
beer
and
liking
it
for
its
crisp
citrus
notes
and
then
seeking
out
beers
with
more
intense
flavors
while
it
pales
in
comparison
to
what
i
enjoy
drinking
now
thats
okay
its
still
very
easy
to
drink
cheap
and
tastes
decent
surprisingly
good
refreshing
and
clean
but
with
good
flavor
for
a
pale
lager
beer
this
beer
is
way
underappreciated
better
than
budweiser
or
coors
banquet
clean
refreshing
and
tasty
a
very
good
macro
lager
overall
if
you
like
drinking
sweaty
ass
drink
mgd
this
was
the
lowest
rated
beer
in
the
aal
bracket
finishing
just
below
bud
light
pale
golden
colored
with
a
trace
of
white
head
barely
appearing
light
brussels
lacing
aroma
of
corn
and
faint
bittering
hops
the
mouth
is
light
and
crisp
i
get
cornlight
malt
and
a
trace
of
bittering
hops
this
is
for
hot
weather
and
is
highly
quaffable
flavor
mild
flavor
of
corn
sweetness
some
white
bread
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
served
in
24
ounce
can
o
i
really
like
this
always
have
goes
down
smooth
very
refreshing
i
know
that
my
legcrossing
pansy
beer
aficionado
peers
sneer
at
this
brew
dont
listen
to
them
this
is
a
good
standard
that
stands
tall
among
its
throng
of
aal
competitors
miller
genuine
draft
25
o
nothing
special
or
good
here
if
you
need
a
cheap
american
lager
pick
miler
high
life
actually
this
however
is
derivative
at
not
really
worth
your
time
you
can
find
cheaper
that
you
wont
notice
if
its
worse
or
even
better
for
that
matter
this
beer
gets
a
bad
wrap
from
some
people
but
really
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
brews
from
miller
that
i
know
of
people
getting
this
and
complaining
seem
like
they
dont
even
realize
what
theyre
buying
it
isnt
meant
to
be
a
craft
beer
at
all
it
simply
suppose
to
taste
like
a
fresh
draft
beer
thats
it
and
to
me
it
tastes
better
than
many
drafts
i
will
admit
the
taste
can
vary
sometimes
they
taste
better
than
others
and
tbh
the
past
mgd
seemed
better
than
whats
made
now
but
maybe
its
my
tastes
changing
no
idea
but
it
has
a
very
cereal
grainy
smell
to
it
stronger
than
any
beer
i
can
think
of
everytime
i
smell
it
i
think
cereal
it
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
in
my
opinion
a
decent
taste
when
i
buy
beer
this
is
basically
the
cheapest
beer
i
will
ever
buy
and
it
sure
does
the
trick
for
what
it
is
the
only
complaint
i
might
have
is
i
can
drink
alot
of
them
seems
like
an
18
pack
of
these
doesnt
last
long
black
crown
is
the
same
way
something
about
them
makes
u
wanna
drink
em
fast
i
liked
this
beer
and
its
one
i
will
start
buying
more
often
as
the
days
turn
warmer
and
thoughts
turn
to
that
of
baseball
games
and
barbeques
quenches
the
thirst
nicely
i
always
keep
some
in
the
fridge
never
drink
water
when
you
can
drink
beer
hops
are
used
and
can
be
tasted
yet
dull
in
taste
and
palate
smell
husky
and
lite
well
it
looked

overall
no

here
but
this
is
not

beer
style
i
like
i
suppose
i
would
choose
this
over
budweiser
though
if
thats
all
the
choice
i
had
doesnt
deserve
the
scrutiny
it
seems
to
be
getting
i
would
defenitely
advise
someone
who
is

to
pick
up
a
few
bottles
of
this
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
for
adjunct
lagers
it
not
half
bad
it
does
have
a
draft
type
creamy
feel
but
it
is
just
your
standard
american
lager
but
i
was
pleasantly
supprised
to
see
how
the

stuck
around
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
wouldnt
ever
pass
up
an

id
just
not
go
out

buy
some

overall
ok
american
pilsner
i
prefer
this
to
the
other
mass
produced
pilsners
like
bud
or
pabst
would
not
buy
a
case
but
will
drink
it
if
only
american
pilsners
are
available
o
actually
not
as
bad
as
i
though
better
than
bud
light
i
like
the
taste
and
how
it
smell
maybe
because
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
you
can
drink
when
you
want
to
refresh
yourself
is
very
good
to
drink
in
hot
temperatures
and
when
people
is
tired
relaxing
etc
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
particularly
offensive
it
has
no
flavours
that
taste
particularly
bad
but
it
tastes
like
nothing
reminded
me
of
perrier
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
at
a
party
or
somewhere
that
i
want
to
get
drunk
cause
it
goes
down
smooth
like
the
water
it
tastes
like
but
nothing
i
would
ever
purchase
of
all
the
american
macro
lagers
i
have
tried
miller
genuine
draft
was
one
of
the
lightest
on
flavor
aroma
and
mouthfeel
this
is
truly
carbonated
water
disguised
as
beer
overall
not
as
bad
as
some
people
say
id
rather
have
this
than
bud
or
coors
and
probably
even
molson
canadian
highly
drinkable
and
easy
to
put
a
few
away
a
guilty
pleasure
sometimes
you
just
need
a
light
heavy
beer
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
nicely
pours
a
dark
golden
color
a
solid
head
that
condensed
quickly
it
drinks
easily
and
is
quite
carbonated
the
taste
dissipated
quickly
quite
refreshing
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
overall
this
is
what
i
thought
all
beer
tasted
like
when
i
was
a
kid
the
quintessential
ew
gross
taste
that
everyone
is
familiar
with
back
when
you
were
6
years
old
and
dad
let
you
get
a
sip
a
fond
memory
looking
back
on
it
back
to
the
beer
itself
id
never
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
and
9
times
out
of
10
id
pass
up
buying
it
if
i
saw
it
never
turn
down
a
free
one
though
and
this
would
be
great
while
doing
some
charcoal
grilling
gritty
yard
work
car
maintenance
or
after
a
rough
shift
theres
a
grit
to
it
that
is
kind
of
charming
but
also
kind
of
gross
serving
type
can
o
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
its
not
that
great
used
to
drink
it
all
the
time
but
i
cant
see
how
i
could
stand
it
i
only
drank
half
a
glass
and
then
gave
it
away
to
my
dad
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
again
since
it
is
more
expensive
than
the
usual
kokanee
or
canadian
but
its
fine
for
the
style
overall
a
refreshing
cheap
light
beer
drank
this
while
watching
a
hockey
game
and
it
was
really
the
perfect
thing
to
sip
on
during
the
game
a
typical
adjunct
but
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
over
other
similar
offerings
such
as
molson
well
its
probably
decent
to
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
night
but
otherwise
id
spend
my
money
on
something
else
overall
there
is
nothing
be
learned
about
this
beer
but
hey
isnt
that
kind
of
the
point
of
dranking
some
beer
was
this
beer
always
this
bad
i
feel
like
when
i
was
a
kid
and
i
went
fishing
with
my
dad
and
he
would
give
me
a
can
of
this
stuff
it
had
some
appeal
some
sort
of
honest
outdoorsy
quality
well
its
completely
gone
maybe
i
grew
up
maybe
they
changed
the
recipe
who
knows
but
this
stuff
isnt
even
fit
to
batter
the
fish
we
used
to
catch
with
the
color
is
closer
to
mountain
dew
than
a
lager
is
there
honestly
yellow
5
in
this
it
smells
like
a
corny
adjunct
but
it
tastes
more
chemical
than
that
almost
with
an
antifreeze
sort
of
potency
to
it
its
daunting
at
least
coors
light
and
its
peers
still
taste
like
beer
to
some
degree
this
taste
like
preservatives
and
artificial
sweeteners
i
can
imagine
how
bad
the
64
is
because
its
parent
beer
is
a
shocker
feel
isnt
that
bad
a
little
thicker
than
it
should
be
but
the
carbonation
is
fine
overall
this
is
something
to
avoid
it
would
chose
it
over
some
of
the
basement
dwellers
and
budlight
on
principle
but
this
is
really
disgusting
the
clear
bottles
do
it
no
favors
either
i
tried
this
beer
one
time
during
the
summer
of
2012
and
thought
it
was
an
ok
to
slightly
decent
beer
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
have
all
of
the
time
but
i
would
probably
recommend
it
to
another
to
try
it
the
taste
was
distinct
and
was
very
smooth
and
different
from
miller
high
life
the
process
of
making
a
draft
beer
gives
this
beer
a
different
characteristic
im
real
hard
pressed
to
find
a
reason
why
this
beer
is
so
hated
other
than
beer
snobbery
maybe
this
beer
is
different
in
the
states
but
i
doubt
it
since
it
is
imported
not
outsourced
brewed
up
to
canada
take
it
from
me
this
beer
is
good
there
may
not
be
anything
to
be
learned
about
beer
when
drinking
this
but
hey
isnt
that
kind
of
the
point
sometimes
i
bought
this
because
it
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
liked
when
i
first
started
drinking
when
i
turned
21
and
my
birthday
is
approaching
so
i
thought
it
would
be
good
to
retry
it
bad
decision
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
has
less
taste
than
miller
lite
avoid
this
if
all
possible
single
finger
white
frothy
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
state
to
bright
golden
clear
body
aroma
is
pretty
bad
with
mostly
pale
maltsbarley
and
musty
wet
sock
hops
a
lot
of
malt
in
the
flavor
with
mild
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
little
in
the
way
of
sweetness
light
to
medium
body
but
still
fairly
oily
coating
the
palate
and
moderate
carbonation
i
think
miller
is
the
worst
of
the
big
three
for
flavors
and
drinkability
this
one
reinforces
that
belief
24
oz
can
into
a
mason
jar
pours
clear
muted
urinesample
yellow
with
the
metallic
slightly
malty
fragrance
common
to
american
macro
lagers
watery
and
bubbly
in
the
mouth
little
taste
to
speak
of
but
lightly
sweet
lightly
bitter
and
very
easy
to
drink
an
inoffensive
crisp
cheap
beer
that
is
better
than
other
beers
at
its
price
point
pours
out
to
a
sudsy
white
head
that
falls
to
a
permanent
3mm
head
significant
lacing
and
pale
yellowgold
color
aroma
is
sweet
grainy
grassy
and
slightly
skunky
flavor
is
a
weak
mixture
of
sweet
grainy
corny
and
slight
tinge
of
over
processed
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
generous
and
rather
watery
on
the
balance
this
is
a
marginally
decent
adjunct
lager
and
reminds
me
a
bit
of
corona
o
it
has
a
little
more
flavor
than
other
bmc
mediocre
this
wasnt
meant
to
be
a
review
from
a
beer
aficionado
just
a
guy
who
likes
to
get
tipsy
overall
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
great
beer
too
bad
it
costs
150
a
bottle
here
when
i
can
afford
this
price
for
a
bottle
of
lager
at
home
this
would
be
among
my
preferences
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
transparent
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
disappears
smells
of
cereal
grain
and
corn
no
hops
at
all
tastes
of
corn
and
grain
not
much
in
the
ways
of
hops
and
very
bland
but
not
watered
down
carbonation
is
heavy
like
most
macros
but
it
is
very
smooth
for
its
light
body
overall
slightly
below
average
beer
it
is
true
to
the
style
light
bodied
balanced
nothing
really
standing
out
except
for
the
malt
taking
a
halfstep
foreward
the
appearance
is
expected
light
golden
showcased
in
the
clear
bottle
its
not
bad
but
not
something
i
go
for
often
these
days
o
overall
fairly
middle
of
the
road
no
major
attractors
or
detractors
fairly
bland
but
isnt
that
in
the
style
description
o
really
not
a
good
beer
i
would
compare
it
with
corona
in
a
sense
only
good
with
a
lime
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
best
overall
it
just
isnt
a
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
pretty
good
but
it
tastes
and
smell
bad
im
constantly
surprised
to
find
people
bringing
it
to
parties
or
storing
it
in
their
fridge
i
can
see
how
some
people
may
find
it
average
at
best
but
i
dont
also
it
is
utterly
terrible
if
not
served
chilled
good
for
the
style
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
what
it
is
would
take
a
michelob
or
yeungling
over
it
though
typical
american
lager
tastes
a
bit
better
than
some
though
o
pretty
bland
beer
could
have
been
worse
relating
this
beer
to
other
mass
produced
adjuncts
it
is
extremely
flavorful
and
refreshing
on
tap
at
the
ah
americsn
legion
208
served
in
a
plastic
cup
light
yellow
color
clear
forms
a
bubbly
white
head
that
quickly
reduces
to
a
patchy
surface
coating
smells
of
grain
and
corn
taste
is
more
of
the
same
sweet
corny
and
grainy
with
just
hint
of
toasty
bitterness
light
bodied
with
a
mealy
mouthfeel
heavy
carbonation
overall
a
standard
shitty
american
brew
overall
smells
terrible
but
tastes
a
little
better
not
that
bad
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
party
beer
othetwise
id
skip
this
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
a
dehydrate
urine
type
of
yellow
standard
of
most
adjunct
lagers
so
nothing
special
going
on
there
there
isnt
very
much
to
say
about
the
smell
either
smells
of
some
corn
and
perhaps
some
barley
here
and
there
the
taste
is
where
this
aal
surprised
me
easily
the
best
offering
from
the
miller
company
that
i
have
had
to
date
perhaps
slightly
beating
high
life
it
doesnt
just
taste
of
carbonated
water
like
most
other
standard
aals
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
has
some
bubbles
and
a
cooked
corn
aftertaste
though
sweet
corn
over
all
a
great
aal
overall
i
guess
i
have
found
a
very
lackluster
beer
even
for
an
adjunct
lager
giving
this
more
than
an
average
score
is
like
calling
yourself
an
alcoholic
overall
this
is
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
its
very
drinkable
but
nothing
special
high
life
is
cheaper
and
a
better
value
but
mgd
is
still
very
enjoyable
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
sweetness
and
a
small
skunkiness
in
the
taste
a
small
sweetness
in
the
malt
and
then
nothing
a
small
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
to
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
watery
and
a
sweetness
and
really
not
much
going
on
overall
not
a
bad
brew
for
what
its
worth
i
try
not
to
be
a
beer
snob
is
this
beer
bad
compared
to
what
else
is
out
there
yes
but
relatively
speaking
its
drinakable
i
would
buy
it
again
and
drink
it
again
its
a
good
change
of
pace
from
bud
diesel
and
coors
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
its
lite
counterpart
overall
slightly
below
average
overall
but
its
pretty
much
your
standard
bmc
product
nothing
special
at
all
for
the
slightly
lower
price
high
life
and
high
life
light
are
right
up
there
with
mgd
lager
is
great
bit
of
an
impulse
tasting
that
went
bad
in
appearance
it
resembles
any
light
beer
clear
and
empty
with
a
similar
taste
the
smell
was
week
but
consistant
mouthfeel
is
not
initially
unpleasant
but
rapidly
deteriorates
into
a
disappointing
aftertaste
overall
its
not
that
bad
if
i
were
to
enjoy
lighter
beers
i
might
not
mind
this
one
but
all
things
considered
this
is
not
my
go
to
beer
my
a
long
shot
pours
just
about
clear
smell
has
alot
of
grain
and
hop
very
plain
good
balance
in
the
taste
definitely
some
hops
in
there
acidic
character
alcohol
a
bit
of
metallic
taste
crispy
feel
but
burns
a
bit
and
a
little
sharp
and
watery
at
the
same
time
still
pretty
drinkable
leaves
a
dry
feeling
thin
body
but
designed
to
be
that
way
so
cant
give
it
too
low
marks
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
a
basic
mainstream
beer
but
i
liked
it
mgd
would
sell
alot
more
if
it
was
cheap
decent
beer
but
there
are
similar
beers
for
less
money
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
soapy
head
that
does
not
last
very
long
a
lot
of
carbonation
no
lacing
on
the
glass
to
speak
of
aroma
is
corn
and
cereal
with
a
faint
hop
smell
taste
is
pretty
much
a
match
of
the
aroma
very
watery
and
thin
bodied
overall
it
is
not
offensive
but
not
something
i
would
drink
o
mainstream
adjunct
lager
they
are
all
about
the
same
but
all
a
tad
different
too
it
is
what
it
is
o
a
very
drinkable
adjunct
i
like
this
for
casual
laid
back
drinking
my
guess
is
the
good
people
at
miller
will
eventually
phase
out
mgd
and
focus
on
high
life
a
far
superior
product
in
my
opinion
and
milwaukees
best
which
tastes
exactly
like
mgd
for
a
fraction
of
the
price
it
would
be
a
good
thirst
quencher
if
it
werent
so
icky
its
not
bad
icky
but
icky
enough
no
matter
its
bitter
and
crummy
whatever
the
name
on
the
label
says
o
i
had
forgotten
just
how
mush
i
hate
macrobeer
this
was
a
harsh
reminder
i
would
choose
water
or
a
car
in
summer
warmed
coke
over
this
swill
any
day
pours
out
an
extremely
clear
morning
urine
yellow
color
the
head
retention
is
actually
quite
impressive
as
is
the
amount
of
carbonation
however
i
dont
think
all
those
bubbles
will
add
anything
positive
to
the
mouthfeel
the
smell
is
actually
less
solvent
and
offensive
as
ive
found
their
other
beers
but
far
from
good
what
i
can
smell
is
a
barely
perceptible
bready
smell
and
other
weird
cereal
grain
smells
no
hop
presence
at
all
wow
tastes
like
your
average
mindless
american
beer
its
even
more
marginal
than
i
thought
it
would
be
its
not
even
bad
enough
to
suck
how
disappointing
some
stale
bread
flavors
old
soggy
grains
and
hmm
cant
pickup
the
corn
the
corn
adjuncts
must
have
been
genetic
bred
out
of
the
beer
and
covered
up
by
those
other
faint
flavors
i
am
describing
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
prickly
but
again
nothing
too
offensive
i
think
miller
has
developed
some
space
age
beer
flavor
now
that
they
are
just
adding
to
their
beers
rather
than
really
brewing
anything
how
do
you
think
they
pulled
of
mgd
64
carbonated
water
and
beer
flavor
concentrate
right
out
of
the
can
pours
a
pale
yellow
crystal
clear
with
a
white
soapy
head
smells
lightly
of
some
cereal
grains
the
flavor
is
light
grainy
character
very
litte
if
any
hop
profile
mouthfeel
is
watery
overall
not
something
i
would
spend
money
on
but
light
and
nonoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
o
avoid
if
you
like
interesting
and
flavourful
beer
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
feb0612b05040047
sampled
on
january
25
2012
i
would
prefer
this
in
a
can
but
i
also
prefer
not
to
buy
a
lot
of
it
so
i
could
only
find
a
6
pack
in
bottles
pretty
average
looking
american
lager
yellow
pour
with
a
burst
of
white
fizzy
head
then
nothing
aroma
is
grain
cereal
and
bread
the
body
is
thin
the
taste
also
rather
bready
with
a
clean
enough
hop
finish
for
the
american
adjunct
style
burger
beer
good
for
days
when
you
know
you
will
drink
more
than
you
should
otherwise
would
pass
the
mgd
looks
good
smells
good
and
tastes
good
it
definately
comes
across
as
trying
to
present
fresh
from
a
keg
i
like
that
which
is
why
i
rated
it
so
high
anything
out
of
a
bottle
is
going
to
taste
better
than
something
out
of
a
can
but
side
by
side
against
the
rolling
rock
id
have
to
give
it
to
the
mgd
this
beer
is
better
than
most
in
the
style
category
but
itll
leave
most
beer
drinkers
seeking
more
flavor
this
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
two
finger
head
good
lacing
the
smell
was
hard
to
define
corn
grass
and
maybe
a
little
skunk
the
carbonation
was
a
little
over
the
top
too
much
for
the
style
the
taste
was
bland
with
a
little
corn
flavor
overall
an
easy
session
beer
and
by
far
the
best
offering
miller
has
in
their
lineup
ive
had
this
many
times
but
after
starting
to
rate
beers
over
the
past
four
months
i
thought
this
would
be
lower
not
too
bad
when
compared
other
similar
types
cheap
beer
edit
after
letting
it
breathe
for
about
20
minutes
it
becomes
slightly
less
rancid
overall
another
beer
that
would
work
well
for
campingcutting
the
grass
etc
not
something
id
buy
again
however
o
i
did
not
hate
this
beer
as
much
i
expected
to
but
that
being
said
i
would
only
reach
for
this
if
i
were
severely
strapped
for
cash
decent
enough
for
what
it
is
o
unimpressive
but
smooth
as
it
is
very
watery
not
much
flavor
and
a
very
simple
brew
best
drunk
fast
and
cold
on
a
sweltering
night
overall
drinkability
pretty
good
in
style
not
a
good
beer
but
good
in
style
i
had
to
reiterate
refreshing
light
slightly
flavorful
am
i
the
only
person
here
who
actually
rates
by
style
still
dr
easily
poundable
as
evidenced
by
frat
boys
decent
price
but
low
quality
a
true
student
beer
though
budget
wise
high
gravity
steel
reserve
is
better
like
i
mentioned
before
this
beer
has
an
offputting
taste
that
i
believe
is
one
of
the
worst
in
the
business
i
gave
it
a
1
5
overall
because
beer
is
better
than
no
beer
bottom
line
desperation
beer
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
finger
of
bright
white
foam
on
top
clumpy
lacing
stuck
to
the
top
of
the
glass
decent

retention
the
aroma
was
quite
sweet
cereal
grains
and
slight
corn
low
bitterness
with
lingering
sweetness
perhaps
a
hint
of
grassiness
more

if

is
it
not
great
but
the
lesser
of
the
evils
it
doesnt
have
a
great
color
there
is
absolutely
no
head
retention
the
taste
is
that
of
adjunct
and
i
dont
even
know
if
your
could
describe
water
as
a
mouth
feel
probably
the
most
tolerable
mass
produced
american
lager
smells
of
grains
corn
is
most
prominent
and
perhaps
some
slight
hops
tastes
of
corn
and
some
malty
sweetness
slight
bitter
metallic
hop
flavor
but
much
less
discernible
than
is
found
in
other
american
lagers
definitely
smooth
and
more
drinkable
than
other
cheap
beers
but
still
tastes
pretty
bland
this
is
one
of
my
cheap
fallback
beer
when
i
cant
or
dont
want
to
spend
more
money
o
poor
yet
has
some
perks
i
cannot
understand
why
this
is
so
popular
maybe
it
is
simply
the
availability
who
knows
a
last
resort
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
blandest
beers
i
can
recall
having
im
glad
i
only
paid
a
dollar
for
this
bottle
food
match
anything
really
you
wont
taste
the
beer
anyhow
so
go
nuts
chilli
pastrami
wasabi
fries
with
a
side
of
hot
english
mustard
yeah
no
forget
the
last
one
d
maybe
okay
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
other
than
that
i
dont
really
care
for
anything
this
beer
has
to
offer
i
prefer
it
over
bud
but
this
is
still
a
very
weak
lager
very
nice
bottle
though
overall
its
not
something
id
actually
purchase
but
at
someone
elses
barbeque
it
was
free
so
i
gave
it
a
try
this
beer
is
a
pale
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
comes
and
goes
very
quickly
i
remember
not
minding
this
beer
at
one
time
but
now
i
cant
even
stand
it
the
smell
is
of
grains
and
corn
the
flavor
is
also
with
a
bit
of
rice
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
like
club
soda
almost
overall
it
just
doesnt
appeal
to
me
this
beer
is
ok
the
only
time
i
drink
it
is
when
the
waitress
at
some
restaurant
tells
me
they
dont
have
high
life
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
beer
its
not
bad
its
not
great
its
just
a
beer
that
is
carried
everywhere
and
is
better
than
its
bmc
light
brethren
verdict
while
its
still
bland
and
thin
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
world
mgd
actually
has
a
decent
wedge
of
malty
character
for
this
style
still
given
a
choice
between
this
and
its
cousin
high
life
id
choose
the
latter
every
time
this
isnt
as
good
as
most
macros
and
given
the
price
12
756
in
canada
is
likely
best
left
ignored
labatt
ver
final
grade
3
13
a
passable
c
mgd
is
nothing
special
but
its
still
a
serviceable
macro
lager
here
in
canada
miller
brands
seriously
lack
the
market
penetration
they
presumably
enjoy
in
the
states
i
literally
cannot
remember
the
last
time
i
saw
someone
buying
this
stuff
that
being
said
this
is
the
sort
of
pale
lager
i
could
drink
all
night
and
not
get
sick
of
light
and
refreshing
and
without
the
obnoxious
corn
and
cardboard
flavours
i
often
find
in
cheaper
offerings
of
this
stripe
its
not
the
sort
of
thing
id
ever
buy
regularly
but
if
someone
handed
me
one
of
these
at
a
party
or
campfire
id
just
be
thankful
it
wasnt
budweiser
or
even
worse
a
light
beer
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
light
bodied
yet
pretty
cloying
to
my
taste
cant
drink
too
many
macros
in
a
row
high
carbonation
an
average
example
of
an
undesirable
style
more
corn
taste
high
carbonation
corn
syrup
sweetness
without
the
viscosity
likely
from
copious
amounts
of
water
aftertaste
is
slightly
unpleasant
like
old
wood
and
bad
malt
liquor
just
not
a
good
beer
i
like
many
of
the
adjunct
products
made
in
wisconsin
and
this
smells
delicious
when
its
being
made
from
a
distance
like
right
around
the
marquette
interchange
but
it
is
simply
not
good
d
of
the
big
adjunct
junk
out
there
this
packs
more
flavor
than
most
there
something
nice
poured
a
clear
peepee
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
finger
of
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
of
peepee
and
stale
grains
indian
corn
thats
been
hanging
on
the
door
too
long
tastes
of
skunk
and
more
peepee
sickeningly
sweet
with
a
rotten
aftertaste
yummy
orefreshing
this
carbonated
water
has
hints
of
corn
and
beer
o
mgd
is
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
its
probably
not
the
best
adjunct
lager
in
its
price
range
though
d
not
bad
one
of
those
every
day
beers
overall
there
was
nothing
particularly
wrong
with
the
beer
but
there
was
also
not
anything
right
about
it
i
actually
had
trouble
finishing
it
because
i
just
lost
interest
i
can
now
bury
that
part
of
my
youth
and
move
on
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavours
and
aromas
this
beer
lacks
alot
of
flavours
and
i
dont
think
i
would
even
drink
this
to
get
drunk
it
was
bowling
night
last
saturday
and
yes
unfortunately
the
bowling
alley
in
the
small
town
i
live
in
has
a
dismal
selection
but
when
you
bowling
with
friends
pitchers
of
mgd
is
not
that
bad
the
appearance
of
mgd
is
fine
its
a
clear
golden
with
good
carbonation
and
head
the
smell
what
smell
the
taste
is
well
beer
certainly
can
call
this
a
lawn
mower
beer
for
several
obvious
reasons
enjoy
and
stay
thirsty
my
friends
incredibly
boring
bland
and
flavourless
its
dull
to
look
at
and
has
little
aroma
taste
or
body
amazing
to
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
selling
brands
in
the
us
avoid
there
are
so
many
better
beers
out
there
d
after
having
a
few
quality
craft
beers
you
could
probably
go
through
a
case
of
this
stuff
i
would
prefer
not
to
drink
this
often
but
i
dont
think
id
turn
one
down
if
i
was
in
want
of
a
beer
and
low
on
cash
it
isnt
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
had
id
rather
get
a
light
buzz
from
this
than
resort
to
drinking
certain
wretched
malt
liquors
just
because
of
the
higher
abv
overall
this
is
the
best
adjunct
lager
ive
had
good
on
a
summer
day
to
slug
down
im
grading
this
on
a
macro
lager
scale
and
its
a
good
one
for
the
style
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
corn
adjuncts
and
sweetness
very
bland
tastes
much
the
same
of
sweet
corn
light
malts
and
overall
very
common
to
light
shit
of
its
style
thick
carbonation
overall
it
is
pretty
trashy
drinkability
seriously
if
this
is
the
only
beer
available
ill
take
a
soft
drink
or
iced
tea
for
me
this
is
not
drinkable
drinkability
if
i
want
to
plow
through
a
dozen
beers
mgd
would
be
on
my
list
of
beers
to
use
slammed
back
one
of
these
this
past
weekend
with
a
few
hot
dogs
at
coney
island
in
worcester
ma
looks
like
a
standard
macro
pale
yellow
color
and
lots
of
carbonation
smell
was
sorta
like
a
cross
between
lettuce
and
rice
taste
was
mostly
bland
but
wasnt
super
offensive
or
anything
like
that
mouthfeel
was
decent
as
it
was
smooth
going
down
a
drinkable
beer
in
my
mind
nothing
horrible
flavorwise
and
tastes
a
bit
better
than
bud
a
bbq
beer
or
party
beer
if
nothing
else
is
available
miller
high
life
has
this
one
beat
as
do
thousands
of
other
beers
not
my
favorite
macro
lager
pretty
basic
beer
going
on
here
flavors
being
a
little
faint
my
be
helping
its
cause
had
this
in
many
different
cities
across
this
great
land
and
its
too
bad
this
was
my
beer
of
choice
when
i
was
a
young
lad
not
at
all
what
i
would
consider
to
be
a
choice
for
drinking
now
i
would
much
rather
have
water
and
wont
even
offer
to
my
friends
i
rated
this
high
in
drinkability
because
i
think
you
can
drink
your
own
weight
of
this
stuff
d
this
is
alcoholic
water
in
a
pinch
not
wanting
to
insult
friends
its
better
than
bud
not
saying
much
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
pours
a
golden
yellow
colour
with
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
no
lacing
but
head
retention
was
pretty
good
smells
quite
grainy
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
flavour
is
incredibly
clean
im
surprised
im
enjoying
this
when
i
fully
expected
to
hate
it
enjoying
doesnt
mean
it
is
good
but
it
isnt
awful
either
much
smoother
mouthfeel
than
many
macro
lagers
i
would
take
this
over
canadian
blue
etc
im
reviewing
this
beer
because
of
the
place
it
holds
in
my
heart
we
all
need
a
measuring
stick
when
it
comes
to
tasting
beer
and
i
use
this
beer
to
set
my
tasteobeer
meter
at
1
all
of
my
friends
thought
the
stuff
is
delicious
but
i
never
got
its
appeal
this
beer
looks
smells
and
tastes
bad
would
not
suggest
this
for
anyone
it
must
taste
good
to
some
people
or
it
would
not
be
around
it
is
like
most
miller
products
just
bad
wish
i
had
something
good
to
say
about
it
really
cant
think
of
anything
d
off
flavors
make
this
watery
beer
undeserving
of
even
the
word
refreshing
this
beer
served
its
purpose
today
well
it
reminded
us
just
how
great
a
great
beer
can
be
and
just
how
bad
a
bad
beer
can
be
compared
to
a
fine
belgian
ale
this
is
a
stark
contrast
now
lets
dump
the
rest
of
this
beer
into
the
soup
and
bring
out
an
ale
please
i
would
most
likely
swill
this
one
again
if
i
was
going
for
a
40oz
beer
rather
than
a
stronger
malt
liquor
this
was
one
of
the
first
brands
i
tried
when
i
hit
drinking
age
and
i
got
a
six
pack
now
just
to
retry
after
20
years
i
cant
believe
ive
got
5
more
of
these
i
have
to
use
up
notes
not
actually
too
bad
just
tasteless
but
i
would
actually
prefer
a
plain
budweiser
over
this
the
worst
part
about
this
beer
is
the
taste
and
that
is
all
that
you
really
need
to
know
avoid
this
one
at
all
costs
even
way
back
when
i
knew
nothing
about
good
beer
at
all
i
still
couldnt
stomach
this
beer
and
that
says
a
lot
horrible
stuff
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
brewers
that
bottle
their
hard
work
in
a
clear
bottle
i
guess
they
are
not
very
proud
of
this
one
neither
am
i
i
tried
to
get
a
head
during
the
pour
but
even
with
all
my
talent
no
luck
this
brew
is
a
light
yellow
color
rating
a
3
on
the
srm
chart
one
of
the
lightest
brews
i
have
seen
smells
like
wet
straw
and
rice
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
smell
because
there
is
less
of
it
rice
and
wet
wheat
are
the
predominate
tastes
with
a
little
malt
no
bite
at
all
mouthfeel
is
bland
almost
like
the
beer
takes
something
away
leaving
a
hole
this
is
another
lawn
work
beer
i
would
rather
do
yard
work
than
drink
this
beer
d
enjoyable
yet
strong
vegetal
flavours
aromas
take
away
form
my
ability
desire
to
have
another
even
after
drinking
a
few
d
easily
a
6pack
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
you
actually
like
it
great
in
the
ontap
version
as
well
either
way
very
easy
to
drink
inoffensive
but
very
thin
not
bad
for
a
summer
time
refreshment
from
a
plastic
twisttop
bottle
comes
beer
11
of
swill
tour
2010
and
another
oddly
short
and
tothepoint
collection
of
thoughts
it
pours
a
clear
jaundice
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
of
metallic
styrofoam
thats
all
i
can
say
about
this
smell
the
taste
is
closer
to
burnt
puffed
rice
and
corn
flakes
the
body
is
exceedingly
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crispish
finish
overall
a
sad
brew
not
offensive
but
nowhere
near
good
the
appearance
is
that
of
a
normal
aal
its
a
semilight
golden
clear
color
the
smell
is
of
rice
and
corn
syrup
the
smell
isnt
that
amazing
the
taste
is
ok
there
is
the
same
tastes
as
smells
plus
there
is
an
almost
ironsteellike
taste
thats
all
i
have
to
say
about
it
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
its
kinda
drinkable
very
chuggable
but
not
very
enjoyable
although
this
does
seem
just
the
same
as
alot
of
other
basic
full
flavored
beers
it
to
me
is
exceptionaly
refreshing
a
great
taste
an
easy
smell
and
a
smooth
quality
again
everybody
has
their
opinions
and
own
desired
taste
for
me
this
is
my
comfort
beer
drinkability
on
a
hot
hot
day
at
a
baseball
game
with
extremely
limited
choices
i
will
frequently
choose
mgd
over
having
no
beer
at
all
otherwise
not
particularly
drinkable
pours
a
pure
white
twofinger
head
that
goes
quickly
to
a
ring
and
leaving
some
lace
medium
carbonation
and
light
bodied
crystal
clear
pale
straw
color
nose
is
no
skunkiness
flavor
is
sweet
corn
and
grass
squeaky
clean
finish
good
lawn
mower
beer
better
than
mgd
64
light
but
that
isnt
saying
much
1
25
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
d
not
as
bad
as
bud
light
my
least
favourite
so
far
but
still
a
very
unimpressive
lager
gave
my
glass
away
after
a
few
sips
cant
believe
i
use
to
drink
this
stuff
d
i
could
physically
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
do
i
want
to
not
really
the
carbonation
makes
you
quite
gassy
i
could
see
this
giving
me
a
wicked
hanging
over
the
body
is
normal
for
the
style
light
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
not
really
any
problem
drinking
this
but
again
like
so
many
other
beers
id
really
rather
just
have
a
water
if
it
came
down
to
drinking
this
or
not
drinking
i
would
honestly
think
about
it
in
a
social
setting
like
a
bbq
i
perhaps
would
drink
a
few
while
hanging
out
but
this
is
certainly
not
something
i
would
have
sitting
at
my
house
d
this
is
a
summertime
party
guzzler
or
lawnmower
beer
and
nothing
else
the
exclusion
of
taste
has
worked
pretty
well
for
the
macro
brews
you
have
to
admit
bright
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
smells
sort
of
like
wet
hay
or
grassy
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
thicker
coating
on
the
mouth
feel
than
i
was
expecting
otherwise
leaves
little
aftertaste
and
not
as
watery
as
many
similar
brews
definitely
one
that
i
could
drink
during
those
hot
summer
days
camping
with
the
guys
i
actually
find
this
to
be
somewhat
pleasant
although
basic
would
go
well
with
peanuts
and
dogs
at
the
ball
game
also
overall
not
a
horrible
beer
by
any
means
but
the
lack
of
flavor
put
up
against
some
of
the
others
i
had
this
week
just
makes
it
pale
still
on
a
100
degree
day
they
can
go
down
like
water
oh
well
i
will
choke
down
the
six
pack
and
do
my
own
beer
runs
d
i
know
this
is
supposed
to
be
pretty
similar
to
high
life
and
there
are
some
obvious
parallels
but
this
is
more
expensive
and
a
lot
less
tasty
why
is
there
a
market
for
this
beer
not
out
and
out
bad
but
theres
little
to
suggest
it
even
amongst
american
macros
d
wouldnt
buy
again
wouldnt
drink
if
free
not
great
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
not
a
pourdownthedrain
either
on
occasion
not
a
big
deal
to
have
absolutely
the
worse
beer
on
the
planet
if
you
like
low
alcohol
no
taste
beer
you
are
either
an
alcoholic
or
a
bum
and
you
probably
love
this
stuff
if
you
are
a
real
beer
drinker
you
know
better
than
this
stay
away
definitely
in
the
top
23
worst
beers
in
the
world
and
im
ashamed
of
being
an
american
when
i
see
people
drink
this
drinkability
is
less
than
pond
water
overall
impression
mgd
is
boring
as
all
get
out
but
it
seems
to
be
a
spoton
manifestation
of
a
premium
american
american
adjunct
lager
it
is
watery
bland
and
hardly
memorable
a
positive
comment
would
be
that
it
has
no
significant
downsides
whereas
a
more
pertinent
comment
would
be
that
there
is
really
no
reason
to
drink
mgd
when
one
could
have
a
more
flavorful
pdb
or
coors
sorry
d
meh
there
are
better
macros
out
there
d
might
as
well
drink
a
water
with
lemon
in
it
why
even
pay
for
this
d
i
could
put
these
away
one
after
another
if
i
felt
like
it
very
light
and
refreshing
with
almost
nothing
to
it
the
beer
appears
the
color
of
gold
can
with
the
words
miller
genuine
draft
the
aroma
is
of
corn
aspirations
rice
and
grain
the
flavor
is
corn
and
grain
with
a
dash
of
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
metal
theres
a
lower
moderate
sweetness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
theres
not
much
else
to
say
the
beer
is
bland
and
inoffensive
drinkability
low
i
wouldnt
buy
nor
drink
this
beer
again
overall
not
at
par
with
high
life
way
too
much
corn
rjt
i
feel
like
a
real
beersnob
trashing
almost
every
common
lager
i
come
across
but
once
you
have
tasted
a
good
beer
these
just
cant
compare
my
pour
got
me
an
easy
two
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
that
immediately
began
to
settle
in
for
the
afternoon
only
the
stock
market
this
past
thursday
fell
faster
unlike
the
market
this
left
behind
something
pretty
in
its
wake
stone
may
poohpooh
fizzy
yellow
beers
all
they
want
but
this
was
nice
a
beautiful
sunshineyellow
beer
with
exemplary
nequality
clarity
the
nose
however
was
rank
with
adjuncts
corn
simply
jumped
out
at
me
speaking
of
nebraska
wow
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
and
there
was
a
slight
lager
sweetness
to
it
but
mostly
it
was
simply
bland
finish
was
moderately
sweet
with
a
slight
tang
but
nothing
worth
noting
i
fet
like
emilio
estevezs
character
in
repo
man
watching
the
circle
jerks
as
a
lounge
act
and
remarking
man
i
used
to
like
these
guys
was
it
enough
to
make
me
want
to
rip
the
badgespatches
off
of
my
first
jacket
no
but
dont
look
for
miller
products
to
get
that
kind
of
placement
on
recent
jackets
either
if
youre
looking
for
an
american
macro
lager
you
could
do
better
or
you
could
do
worse
than
this
it
is
what
it
is
a
clean
refreshing
nonoffensive
beer
light
a
little
thin
when
this
stuff
is
cold
its
great
for
slaking
a
hard
days
nights
thirst
personally
prefer
high
life
at
a
lower
cost
but
this
has
enough
of
that
miller
flavor
to
be
a
good
changeup
is
it
a
great
west
coast
ipa
or
a
great
german
dopplebock
no
does
it
try
to
be
no
what
it
is
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
in
the
american
macro
style
and
ive
drank
a
helluva
lot
worse
d
a
decent
beer
have
had
many
of
these
in
the
past
but
not
something
i
generally
seek
out
would
only
consider
having
another
in
the
absence
of
craft
beer
like
today
final
thoughts
used
to
pound
these
back
back
in
the
early
college
days
before
i
was
enlighted
in
beerdom
used
to
hate
beer
because
of
mgd
decided
to
try
it
a
few
days
ago
and
see
if
my
opinion
had
changed
it
didnt
d
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
worst
from
the
style
i
just
hate
those
tartfruityapple
like
notes
ugh
i
dont
hate
this
style
though
so
dont
get
me
wrong
dont
like
this
one
at
all
though
id
pass
for
a
bud
any
day
but
over
that
id
take
a
schlitz
which
is
currently
my
favorite
for
the
style
overall
i
honestly
dont
have
much
to
say
about
mgd
either
way
its
not
as
good
as
miller
lite
which
is
more
refined
but
isnt
repulsive
i
understand
that
i
write
these
reviews
almost
entirely
for
the
converted
those
who
like
me
share
in
the
pleasures
of
real
and
diverse
beers
and
although
there
cannot
be
many
whose
minds
can
be
converted
simply
by
the
act
of
reading
this
any
mgd
drinkers
out
there
i
implore
you
to
try
different
styles
and
give
your
local
microbrewery
a
chance
eh
not
really
one
to
seek
out
and
get
reviewed
at
a
beer
sampling
congratulations
mgd
you
are
the
winner
in
the
miller
taste
testing
of
12410
appearance
is
a
light
golden
color
with
a
light
crisp
head
smell
of
a
slightly
sweet
corn
cereal
taste
has
the
light
sweet
corn
mild
hop
and
a
metallic
flavor
thats
a
little
watered
down
mouthfeel
is
light
with
fair
body
with
good
carbonation
its
not
terrible
but
i
still
prefer
the
high
life
i
though
this
was
going
to
be
like
high
life
boy
was
i
wrong
this
is
definitely
noticeably
obviously
much
worse
than
highlife
holy
crap
was
this
sixer
a
waste
of
money
shit
well
its
watery
the
head
dies
quicker
than
charlie
up
against
some
silver
fish
and
the
smell
is
oddly
metallic
for
a
glass
bottle
the
feel
is
easy
drinking
easy
chugging
actually
d
i
did
not
find
this
an
altogether
enjoyable
experience
but
i
didnt
mind
drinking
it
for
old
times
sake
there
have
certainly
been
a
few
nights
of
mgd
in
the
past
but
now
i
remember
why
i
dont
drink
it
anymore
flat
undercarbonated
and
just
not
enjoyable
mouthfeel
in
any
way
unless
maybe
you
are
dehydrated
in
the
desert
an
unquestionable
and
dramatic
improvement
as
opposed
to
miller
high
life
you
may
be
mildly
surprised
then
again
there
are
way
better
macros
out
there
dont
settle
for
this
garbage
cheers
drinkability
too
damn
boring
to
enjoy
this
even
on
a
hot
summers
day
if
i
want
a
simple
lager
that
actually
is
refreshing
from
miller
ill
stick
with
the
high
life
carbonation
is
huge
and
of
course
the
body
is
extremely
watery
d
the
whole
point
of
this
beer
is
to
be
drinkable
get
tanked
on
well
with
its
lack
of
charactere
i
find
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
to
be
extremely
low
drinkability
ahh
coldfilter
me
away
to
beer
heaven
miller
its
a
pretty
good
beer
for
after
for
watching
a
football
game
with
the
guys
d
nothing
was
particularly
bad
about
this
beer
but
i
could
by
many
flavorful
beers
for
the
same
price
clean
almost
no
flavour
but
beside
that
no
defect
mgd
is
a
run
of
the
mill
american
lager
i
had
it
served
very
cold
poured
a
moderate
yellow
thin
head
with
a
grainy
smell
taste
was
strong
but
not
as
bitter
no
idea
why
less
bitter
sounds
like
a
good
idea
to
some
people
when
this
has
a
sticky
sugar
cereal
flavor
that
sticks
around
for
some
time
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
then
drank
one
of
these
only
to
find
that
i
taste
a
lot
of
concord
grapes
i
dont
know
why
or
how
but
allows
me
to
drink
a
mouthful
or
two
before
walking
out
of
the
beer
tent
with
its
uneven
grass
covered
ground
and
mud
everywhere
besides
the
barley
smell
there
is
very
little
aroma
present
stocking
in

of
this
would
probably
get
them
by

you
could
drink
a
lot
because
it

there
is

it

in

if
you
havent
downed

so
i

it
has

i
feel

thats
forsure
a

not
enough

even
so
in
a
pinch
which
i
always
am
with
most
of
my
family
or
friends
thisll
have
to
do
overall
flavor
is
definitely
the
high
point
for
this
beer
salud
pretty
much
a
standard
american
fizzy
yellow
flavorless
lager
the
smell
is
really
bad
but
the
flavor
is
ok
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
i
certainly
wouldnt
buy
this
but
at
a
wedding
reception
it
was
fun
to
review
just
another
faceless
macro
that
doesnt
distinguish
itself
in
any
way
from
the
masses
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
taste
and
smell
like
nothing
boy
was
i
wrong
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
of
foam
that
dissipated
quickly
at
first
the
only
aroma
was
alcohol
but
when
i
swirled
it
around
i
got
some
kind
of
a
fruit
smell
in
the
background
the
taste
was
average
but
it
had
just
a
little
bit
more
flavor
than
most
average
macros
this
was
another
beer
that
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
watery
and
thin
for
me
if
you
can
this
as
cheap
as
me
then
its
worth
it
now
this
is
what
i
was
talking
about
perhaps
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tried
the
tatse
is
like
drinking
a
tire
and
the
mouthfeel
is
the
worst
because
you
can
feel
it
even
after
5
years
believe
me
you
do
not
want
to
mess
with
this
beer
if
you
dirnk
it
it
will
get
even
with
your
worst
beer
dreams
overall
definitely
not
worth
buying
if
you
want
a
decent
tasting
lager
this
is
a
great
beer
drinking
game
beer
i
would
drink
it
if
that
was
all
there
was
at
the
party
but
i
wouldnt
be
having
a
good
time
some
years
ago
i
made
a
one
off
business
trip
to
milwaukee
and
on
a
free
afternoon
me
and
my
colleague
went
to
visit
the
miller
brewery
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
to
learn
that
despite
the
german
roots
of
the
founders
the
reinheitsgebot
purity
law
of
1516
stating
that
beer
be
made
only
from
malt
hops
and
water
is
not
adhered
to
such
is
rarely
a
sign
of
quality
and
in
the
case
of
the
big
american
brewers
ab
miller
coors
the
reasons
seem
to
be
rather
economic
no
surprise
then
the
brew
is
totally
bland
watery
and
insignificant
as
it
is
commercially
highly
successful
it
may
seem
that
some
drinkers
are
scared
of
taste
the
only
reason
i
took
notes
on
this
was
because
i
couldnt
remember
having
reviewed
it
before
same
ol
piss
yellow
pour
with
a
thin
canned
beer
head
okay
theres
something
of
a
malt
character
here
before
it
gets
overwhelmed
by
corn
not
so
much
saccharine
or
cloying
but
like
drinking
from
a
cup
smeared
with
lipstick
empty
barley
pop
drinkability
i
have
a
slight
preference
for
this
beer
over
the
many
others
in
the
style
thats
not
saying
much
theres
a
lot
to
dislike
about
this
beer
but
in
comparison
to
other
macro
beers
its
more
enjoyable
for
a
truly
tasty
beer
however
you
dont
need
me
to
tell
you
to
look
elsewhere
the
gold
of
the
american
beers
in
its
bottle
of
12
oz
the
perfect
serving
for
bbq
buddies
meeting
6
oclock
etc
its
appearance
is
exceptional
pure
nugget
smell
so
good
remain
my
first
draft
beer
in
mexico
malt
and
hops
really
balanced
and
the
best
thing
of
all
its
packaging
sorry
for
my
comments
on
the
bottles
package
and
presentation
i
am
a
professional
graphic
designer
its
an
option
when
i
hang
with
my
non
beer
geek
friends
in
places
like
dayton
ohio
and
go
to
bars
that
have
five
beers
available
and
this
is
inevitably
one
by
no
means
good
but
a
drinkable
macro
if
you
have
buddies
who
like
bars
with
mechanical
bulls
there
is
nothing
really
special
about
mgd
however
it
is
not
terrible
it
is
good
to
order
at
a
restaraunt
with
food
if
you
want
to
enjoy
a
good
beer
this
is
not
a
good
choice
have
it
maybe
with
a
pizza
as
it
wont
fill
you
up
but
it
will
wet
your
whistle
and
compliment
your
food
probably
one
of
the
better
college
aimed
session
brews
out
there
drinkability
owing
to
its
generally
inoffensive
smell
and
taste
properties
mgd
isnt
a
bad
session
beer
i
can
think
of
things
that
would
be
more
pleasant
to
drink
beers
i
might
be
less
ashamed
of
but
if
theres
nothing
else
id
take
mgd
over

oh
boy
before
i
knew
anything
about
beer
years
ago
this
was
my
favorite
can
pours
a
two
finger
fluffy
white
amusement
park
head
over
a
crystal
clear
light
tan
liquid
amusement
park
meaning
plasticfakelooking
like
purposefully
deteriorating
styrofoam
bubbles
smells
saaz
hoppy
with
some
dried
hay
and
faint
malt
there
is
an
edge
of
cardboard
tastes
mild
gentle
saaz
hoppy
that
almost
comes
across
as
wellchew
on
peppermint
gum
malt
sweet
is
below
this
and
is
corn
and
mildly
honey
covered
cardboard
pretty
disappointing
considering
my
high
expectations
oh
well
light
body
and
md
to
mdheavy
carbonation
i
dont
know
how
this
ended
up
in
my
fridge
but
sadly
im
out
of
good
beer
but
its
still
really
hot
here
and
im
really
thirsty
so
here
we
go
ladies
and
gents
this
really
doesnt
look
inviting
smell
is
pretty
terrible
soaked
cardboard
thats
been
run
over
by
a
car
maybe
a
few
cars
with
muddy
tires
yep
this
is
pretty
much
the
worst
beer
ive
had
granted
im
drinking
it
right
after
a
rogue
brutal
bitter
one
of
my
favs
but
this
stuff
sucks
ive
been
getting
by
this
summer
consuming
a
lot
of
labatt
blue
and
genny
cream
ale
with
my
macro
drinking
friends
but
this
is
almost
undoable
theres
a
gross
burpypuke
taste
to
this
beer
you
know
when
youre
real
full
and
you
take
a
sip
of
beer
and
then
burp
well
this
beer
tastes
like
that
burp
yuk
i
think
the
trick
to
this
beer
is
leaving
it
in
the
bottle
or
funneling
pours
a
pale
straw
with
a
head
that
raisies
just
above
one
finger
the
thin
white
head
remains
to
the
finish
and
it
has
good
lacing
you
can
smell
and
taste
the
adjuncts
in
this
one
and
not
much
else
poor
balance
the
higher
carbonation
helps
it
go
down
a
little
smoother
but
there
is
harsh
aftertaste
and
a
brutal
finish
the
cold
filtered
technique
to
make
this
taste
like
a
draft
beer
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
clear
golden
somewhat
pale
but
still
golden
with
a
large
white
foam
head
with
some
stickiness
to
boot
smell
was
mild
malt
some
cornlike
odors
but
nothing
harsh
or
skunky
taste
was
typical
for
the
style
with
a
rough
feel
toward
the
end
honestly
it
triggered
sensations
of
playing
baseball
either
from
the
crap
we
drank
after
a
game
or
from
my
days
in
the
kingdome
i
cant
recall
mouthfeel
was
expected
to
be
thin
and
was
but
the
carbonation
and
malthusk
flavors
were
damaging
to
any
smooth
finish
this
one
might
have
had
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
necessary
my
guess
is
that
miller
simply
wanted
a
beer
that
looked
like
a
decent
draft
when
poured
from
the
bottle
or
can
in
this
they
succeeded
but
they
forgot
that
their
demographic
doesnt
pour
its
pretentious
dont
you
know
i
know
now
that
miller
did
not
just
brew
one
beer
and
place
a
mgd
label
on
one
bottle
and
high
life
on
another
its
true
what
everyone
is
saying
miller
high
life
taste
better
mgd
pours
light
gold
with
good
white
head
light
and
watery
mouthfeel
like
most
macros
some
bitterness
and
aftertaste
at
finish
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
to
me
i
really
was
not
offended
by
the
taste
just
not
has
much
to
my
liking
as
other
macro
i
have
tried
while
this
isnt
a
beer
that
gives
you
a
whole
lot
in
the
flavour
department
there
isnt
anything
offensive
about
it
either
mgd
is
actually
one
of
the
better
macros
and
one
that
i
drink
regularly
when
in
establishments
that
dont
serve
craft
beer
it
makes
a
great
free
beer
it
looks
brightly
golden
with
yellow
tones
and
a
sparkling
white
head
dont
blinkyoull
miss
it
smells
grainy
sweet
with
vegitable
corn
flavors
acidic
and
scrubs
the
palate
a
bit
finishes
grainy
and
vegie
like
though
clean
all
in
all
its
an
average
beer
for
a
mass
produced
lager
havent
had
this
in
quite
a
while
but
remember
it
clearly
wasnt
glass
worthy
but
everyone
knows
this
stuff
is
pale
yellowgold
taste
was
the
same
as
most
of
macros
ive
had
except
the
finish
was
dominated
by
some
kind
of
metal
aluminum
thin
effervescent
mouthfeel
i
would
say
its
a
good
summer
thirst
quenching
beer
but
its
brother
high
life
does
that
better
this
is
not
a
macro
that
i
would
really
recommend
although
i
know
a
lot
of
people
who
swear
by
this
beer
its
just
a
little
too
sharp
and
raw
for
my
taste
if
im
going
macro
im
going
with
something
smooter
and
more
fullbodied
like
a
high
life
or
a
strohs
it
is
what
it
is
crap
this
macro
is
almost
painful
to
drink
the
aftertaste
is
really
tough
to
get
passed
youre
better
off
throwing
this
out
before
you
open
it
highly
carbonated
goes
down
pretty
easy
much
better
than
the
other
macros
in
my
opinion
but
that
still
isnt
saying
much
drinkability
after
the
smell
and
the
initial
taste
i
was
a
bit
impressed
even
started
thinking
could
this
be
a
new
camping
and
lawn
mowing
beer
but
no
the
finish
ruined
it
that
powdery
dryness
is
just
not
good
coming
from
a
cheap
watery
thirstquencher
lost
major
points
there
sampled
as
part
of
my
ongoing
quest
for
the
best
cheap
canned
beer
for
the
lake
havent
found
it
yet
poured
a
typical
pale
goldenstraw
easily
generated
a
meringuelike
fluffy
head
in
fact
on
fairly
vigorous
pour
caused
so
much
foaming
that
most
of
the
carbonation
went
out
of
that
part
of
the
beer
aroma
was
a
vague
suggestion
of
malt
and
cooked
corn
clean
and
astringent
bordering
on
tart
finish
was
a
bit
muddled
with
some
nondescript
but
not
particularly
hoppy
bittering
and
a
lingering
cooked
corn
grits
taste
poured
out
to
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
medium
bubbly
head
seemed
to
pour
with
a
bit
of
viscosity
aroma
of
corn
and
husk
are
noted
as
well
as
a
touch
of
sweetness
flavor
is
overpowering
with
corn
as
the
main
flavor
with
only
notes
of
alcohol
and
hops
being
present
finished
with
a
heavy
aftertaste
of
corn
and
almost
sticky
mouthfeel
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
for
what
it
is
i
suppose
its
not
terrible
worth
a
try
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
but
it
holds
a
place
for
me
in
memory
not
very
differnt
from
any
other
macro
asice
from
memories
of
12
a

pack
and
many

nights
straw
yellow

white
head
for
a
macro
i
must
say
the
head
retention
is
not

grainy

some
soft
malts
kind
of
bland
very
smooth
with
a
decent
amount

grains
light

not

not

just
your
average

i
think
the
cans
have
a
cool
color
scheme
so
thats
a
positive
calling
a
beer
in
a
can
genuine
draft
however
but
enough
to
cut
down
on
the
drinkability
a
bit
wherever
you
are
but
a
very
good
macro
i
dont
like
its
higher
price
here
heavily
carbonated
mouthfeel
makes
mgd
one
of
the
least
drinkable
massproduced
lagers
on
the
market
its
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
followed
by
a
nondescript
sour
aftertaste
on
subsequent
gulps
and
you
can
drink
more
than
one
without
retching
on
the
other
hand
nose
is
prototypical
malt
but
if
i
was
drinking
from
a
keg
on
someones
lawn
and
had
to
choose
between
mgd
but
i
am
not
averse
to
buying
a
sixpack
every
now
and
then
when
i
cant
decide
what
i
want
at

they
is
it
because
miller
high
life
is
was
and
always
will
be
the
best
party
beer
on
the
market
you
can
bet
your
only
can
of
heady
topper
it
is
try
drinking
12
cans
of
heady
topper
i
guarantee
you
will
puke
not
so
with
high
life
light
crisp
slight
hop
taste
with
a
wet
finish
easily
put
away
12
of
these
babies
with
no
sickness
or
bloated
feeling
no
headache
high
life
deserves
more
credit
it
taught
us
all
how
to
drink
beers
pretty
good
beer
to
party
with
if
u
dont
have
that
much
cash
i
have
always
liked
miller
high
life
it
is
pretty
refreshing
and
crisp
but
not
completely
tasteless
it
is
nothing
special
but
pretty
good
for
an
adjunct
lager
best
out
of
all
the
cheap
shitty
beers
crisp
easy
to
drink
much
better
than
bud
light
this
is
ok
in
bottles
almost
undrinkable
in
cans
for
a
pilsner
i
find
this
beer
good
much
better
than
most
american
beers
i
think
if
people
did
a
blind
taste
test
they
would
rate
it
higher
if
this
is
the
high
life
end
me
now
overall
it
would
not
be
hard
to
drink
a
6
pack
of
these
one
of
my
preferred
aals
and
one
of
the
best
quality
beers
for
the
price
a
good
beer
to
drink
just
to
relax
get
drunk
or
just
to
party
with
has
maybe
the
best
head
and
lacing
of
an
american
lager
ive
tasted
a
quality
beer
especially
considering
the
value
price
point
not
fancy
but
solid
good
in
bottles
bad
in
cans
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
its
cheap
and
good
it
smells
like
metal
dead
skunk
with
a
chemical
taste
to
it
man
color
like
piss
flat
taste
like
water
no
wonder
its
so
cheap
good
for
the
price
it
is
highly
carbonated
so
it
makes
you
burp
alot
one
of
the
best
cheap
party
beers
out
there
my
goto
for
quantity
over
quality
is
a
tie
between
this
and
yuengling
this
shit
is
legit
seriously
a
golden
oldie
grew
up
in
the
70s
and
every
other
beer
is
compared
to
it
nothing
special
or
pretentious
about
but
takes
you
back
like
you
are
meeting
an
old
friend
would
say
probably
the
best
value
beer
or
the
one
i
want
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
have
enjoyed
this
for
too
long
as
in
it
was
frequently
stolen
from
my
dad
i
think
that
it
is
very
refreshing
has
a
cool
look
to
the
bottle
and
is
carbonated
well
enough
so
it
doesnt
seem
to
go
skunky
and
flat
as
many
others
in
its
class
do
i
have
outgrown
it
but
will
take
one
without
hesitating
if
you
hand
it
to
me
unless
there
are
roofiies
in
it
or
lsd
or
urine
anything
else
is
cool
not
the
champagne
of
beers
i
guess
it
is
what
it
is
the
look
and
feel
scores
apply
to
the
bottled
i
always
pour
my
beer
into
a
glass
but
for
miller
high
life
i
drink
straight
from
the
bottle
and
its
the
only
exception
i
make
tastes
the
same
now
as
it
did
when
i
was
a
kid
retro
look
retro
feel
soso
taste
but
on
hot
summer
days
this
is
a
five
straight
across
the
board
good
beer
to
have
a
couple
but
more
than
that
usually
leaves
me
much
more
bloated
than
with
other
beers
must
be
all
the
carbonation
definitely
the
champagne
of
beers
better
taste
than
miller
lite
this
stuff
sucks
that
is
about
it
on
par
with
the
other
bmc
flagship
brands
although
this
one
does
have
a
slight
skunky
aspect
very
early
in
my
driniking
the
80s
i
moved
away
from
this
choice
to
find
other
lessworse
offerings
thet
werent
much
better
a
honest
beer
at
a
tasty
price
when
low
on
doe
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
it
is
what
it
is
an
american
classic
so
great
a
great
value
american
adjunct
delicious
beer
but
it
gets
heavy
to
drink
towards
the
end
and
old
this
beer
is
really
good
a
good
throwback
beer
drinkable
flavorful
nothing
wrong
with
cracking
one
of
these
open
after
a
hard
day
of
work
problem
is
it
is
watery
and
swilly
and
has
a
metallic
taste
to
it
also
some
dirty
corn
grain
flavors
little
surprised
by
this
one
tasted
great
in
fishbowl
at
marios
fishbowl
in
morgantown
west
by
god
virginia
shitty
beer
nothing
more
to
say
way
to
carbonated
no
real
taste
mostly
feels
like
water
would
not
drink
again
cheap
beer
i
find
myself
buying
it
a
lot
in
30
racks
hey
its
my
fav
cheap
american
beer
definitely
living
the
high
life
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
back
in
2007
because
i
just
turned
21
and
college
and
it
cost
about
five
cents
for
a
30rack
its
not
my
favorite
dirtcheap
lager
any
more
but
it
still
holds
a
place
in
my
heart
it
tastes
like
sweet
corn
and
nostalgia
horrible
mouth
feel
drinkable
but
not
pleasant
the
carbonation
is
the
real
gimmick
of
this
beer
which
just
makes
it
extra
easy
to
chug
when
this
beer
is
ice
cold
there
are
few
better
very
pleasing
to
the
palette
but
its
gotta
be
bottled
when
you
have
it
canned
you
miss
a
little
of
the
effervescence
this
is
right
up
there
with
grain
belt
nordeast
as
the
best
aal
nothing
that
will
blow
you
away
but
you
could
have
20
of
these
at
a
cookout
and
not
feel
full
im
craving
one
right
now
look
is
typical
of
american
adjacent
lagers
smell
is
if
metallic
copper
and
iron
with
hits
of
stale
grain
taste
is
even
worse
at
first
you
get
dank
grains
then
taken
by
overpowered
metallic
funk
this
stuff
tastes
like
a
result
of
a
bar
fight
just
metallic
blood
and
left
over
beer
feel
is
very
much
like
champagne
like
the
name
suggests
overall
is
terrible
i
would
have
to
be
very
sloshed
to
drink
this
and
not
want
to
punch
a
stranger
from
the
funky
twang
it
leaves
in
your
mouth
its
the
champagne
of
beers
what
else
is
there
to
say
obviously
you
dont
want
to
buy
this
if
your
looking
for
a
beer
drinking
experience
but
for
an
inexpensive
brew
that
is
a
known
quantity
you
can
do
worse
for
the
price
this
is
a
solid
beer
a
little
overcarbonated
and
skunky
but
what
you
are
paying
for
is
what
you
get
in
this
instance
it
is
really
not
a
bad
deal
miller
high
life
is
a
very
good
starting
light
beer
the
high
life
is
a
drinking
beer
not
terribly
bad
middle
of
the
road
for
aal
head
dissipated
to
an
ugly
river
foam
like
quality
while
the
pabst
i
had
poured
next
to
it
retained
a
creamy
dense
head
i
also
chose
pabst
3
for
3
blind
taste
testing
the
two
high
life
was
not
bad
just
not
great
ok
so
it
looks
like
piss
well
that
makes
it
correct
for
the
style
it
smells
like
rotting
hay
and
chemicals
again
correct
for
the
style
im
not
sure
i
can
detect
much
taste
its
good
on
a
hot
day
it
is
a
watery
swill
that
glides
down
my
binge
drinking
throat
i
love
this
beer
it
is
like
your
first
girlfriend
that
you
fingered
under
the
bleachers
at
a
school
pep
fest
yeah
she
looks
pretty
bad
by
todays
standards
but
i
prefer
to
fondly
remember
faint
memories
while
i
erase
the
current
nothing
to
really
say
about
this
usually
i
crack
open
a
pack
of
beer
on
the
uconn
huskies
games
also
ul
and
uk
for
basketball
as
well
as
the
boston
celtics
watch
nascar
too
this
beer
goes
well
with
all
of
those
things
also
goes
good
with
my
wings
that
i
put
in
ghost
pepper
sauce
o
k
its
easy
to
be
snobbish
and
dump
on
this
beer
its
nothing
special
granted
it
is
my
chosen
everyday
beer
though
its
very
economical
a
30
pack
runs
around
12
50
its
easy
drinking
and
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
hard
to
beat
formerly
i
had
been
drinking
bud
for
years
but
i
decided
that
high
life
has
a
smoother
finish
i
wouldnt
call
it
the
champagne
of
bottled
beer
maybe
the
wine
spritzer
this
brand
has
been
around
for
well
over
100
years
though
surviving
a
prohibition
which
killed
off
thousands
of
beers
and
breweries
so
even
if
you
dont
care
for
it
yourself
you
have
to
admit
its
a
survivor
good
cheap
i
dont
much
like
it
its
got
decent
body
and
flavor
but
it
has
a
sweetness
aftertaste
i
really
dont
like
fruity
palate
thats
for
sure
perhaps
drinkable
by
you
i
will
give
it
a
pass
every
time
do
not
care
for
millers
flavor
choices
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
enjoyable
my
friend
jokingly
used
it
as
a
palate
cleanser
during
a
big
stout
tasting
last
night
and
it
was
actually
a
very
refreshing
change
of
pace
im
now
thinking
of
throwing
this
or
something
similar
into
my
drinking
rotation
from
time
to
time
and
thats
fine
by
me
still
cheap
beer
does
have
its
place
sometimes
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
and
the
go
to
beer
light
yellow
very
heavily
carbonated
a
little
skunky
but
good
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
ok
beer
but
leaves
a
weird
dry
grainy
film
in
my
mouth
not
half
bad
as
far
as
aals
go
clear
pale
golden
served
in
its
familiar
clear
glass
bottle
at
texas
chili
parlor
in
austin
tx
light
bodied
fizzy
somewhat
sweetly
malty
but
without
some
of
the
harsher
off
flavors
of
its
brethren
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
just
right
with
a
bowl
of
red
it
says
it
right
on
the
label
the
champagne
of
beer
you
get
all
the
effervescence
and
character
of
a
fine
champagne
with
the
drinkability
and
flavor
of
a
light
pilsner
high
enough
abv
to
drink
all
day
but
classy
enough
to
impress
a
date
highlife
truly
has
it
all
i
stole
this
from
someones
garage
when
i
was
17
after
drinking
1
i
put
the
rest
back
enjoyed
some
while
watching
the
vintage
moto
races
at
barber
motorsports
park
in
birmingham
alabama
if
youre
looking
to
gag
this
is
the
beer
for
you
great
beer
for
the
money
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
16oz
cans
for
4
88
at
my
local
walmart
perfect
for
hot
days
like
many
have
said
i
just
wish
miller
lite
was
this
cheap
overall
hard
to
beat
a
beer
that
is
easy
on
the
wallet
and
easy
to
drink
14
gets
you
a
30cans
pack
which
is
more
than
double
for
the
same
price
as
imports
has
a
nasty
aroma
but
after
few
sips
it
goes
away
very
easy
to
drink
especially
with
snacks
decent
swill
for
5
high
life
is
an
odd
one
for
me
when
you
start
drinking
a
nice
fresh
cold
one
it
is
pretty
solid
and
easy
to
drink
nice
crisp
flavor
nothing
wrong
with
it
as
it
warms
up
though
it
becomes
pretty
bad
not
warm
warm
but
basically
as
warm
as
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
tends
to
be
when
you
get
down
there
luckily
they
make
grenades
those
7
ounce
bottles
and
this
helps
with
that
i
do
prefer
them
in
the
smaller
packaging
however
even
in
12
ounce
form
they
are
cheap
enough
to
dump
out
the
last
2
or
3
ounces
so
its
not
a
big
deal
while
im
usually
a
craft
drinker
and
primarily
an
import
drinker
before
craft
sometimes
i
want
a
lighter
tasting
lower
abv
beer
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
doing
some
yard
work
high
life
is
my
go
to
for
that
the
better
version
comes
from
the
can
not
the
clear
bottle
it
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
lingers
for
a
couple
of
minutes
nice
lacing
its
somewhat
sweet
to
the
taste
there
is
nothing
offensive
at
all
going
on
with
the
aroma
taste
or
mouthfeel
no
off
notes
nothing
exciting
going
on
either
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
for
the
type
of
beer
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
goto
beers
perfect
for
the
summer
o
not
the
worst
i
have
to
say
ive
had
some
craft
beer
a
lot
worse
than
this
but
this
was
pretty
bad
couldnt
really
finish
the
can
keep
in
mind
im
rating
this
a
5
because
im
new
to
beer
and
this
is
the
best
out
of
what
i
have
had
i
dont
really
know
what
to
describe
the
taste
like
just
kind
of
like
corn
sweet
i
drink
this
because
i
didnt
have
a
job
and
was
not
able
to
buy
more
expensive
things
i
have
read
however
this
has
won
the
gold
medal
for
best
american
style
lager
several
times
i
think
i
know
why
they
call
this
the
high
life
though
it
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
living
the
high
life
due
to
the
taste
and
quality
for
the
price
their
advertising
campaigns
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
this
is
a
testament
to
working
men
and
women
i
got
paid
my
first
paycheck
recently
and
i
bought
some
of
this
and
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
in
style
this
is
better
quality
in
my
opinion
than
budweiser
and
its
cheaper
there
is
a
reason
it
rated
highly
in
american
adjunct
lagers
as
you
categorize
them
on
the
site
apparently
the
alstrom
brothers
on
this
site
agree
with
me
they
gave
it
an
81
i
think
miller
is
the
best
out
of
the
as
you
guys
on
the
site
call
them
the
macro
brews
whether
its
fishing
or
a
barbeque
or
fourth
of
july
party
this
goes
good
with
anything
i
love
this
with
a
nice
hamburger
and
steak
fries
overall
3
29
dont
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
this
beer
isnt
out
to
compete
against
crafts
its
meant
to
be
a
working
mans
beer
after
a
long
day
in
the
sun
for
that
purpose
it
does
just
fine
high
life
is
a
tasty
treat
abundant
with
corn
if
you
hate
corn
or
cornbased
beers
stay
away
very
adjuncty
mildly
sweet
absolute
zero
bitter
no
hops
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
because
its
so
cheap
and
its
still
tasty
where
else
can
you
get
an
18
pack
of
bottles
for
10
or
a
30
pack
of
cans
for
15
or
a
24
oz
for
1
49
for
that
matter
long
live
high
life
very
sweet
among
the
sweetest
mass
production
beers
on
the
market
very
distinctive
corn
flavor
yes
it
is
not
good
beer
but
it
is
also
extremely
cheap
and
very
drinkable
make
sure
it
is
cold
really
cold
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
when
i
am
doing
yard
work
better
than
its
competition
frankly
if
i
go
to
an
event
where
only
aals
are
being
served
i
hope
i
can
find
this
swimming
in
the
bottom
of
the
ice
chest
the
color
is
pale
straw
with
a
big
but
fleeting
head
that
gives
way
to
minimum
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
dominated
by
adjuncts
but
if
cold
enough
the
flavor
is
tolerable
the
carbonation
level
is
good
and
the
beer
does
feel
rich
in
your
mouth
overall
one
of
the
best
in
a
generally
poor
class
overall
for
an
aal
this
is
actually
pretty
far
up
there
for
me
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
a
very
refreshing
unadulterated
beer
for
weather
when
its
hotter
than
hell
and
you
just
want
something
quaffable
i
would
never
get
this
in
a
format
other
than
a
can
considering
the
clear
bottle
for
this
style
i
would
argue
this
is
the
best
i
am
a
sea
creature
look
it
up
not
much
can
be
said
about
this
beer
its
a
cheap
beer
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
way
better
than
pabst
which
for
some
reason
has
become
cool
to
drink
over
the
last
decade
or
so
as
far
as
cheap
beers
go
this
is
in
my
opinion
among
the
best
not
that
i
am
saying
its
a
spectacular
beer
but
if
you
want
a
cold
beer
like
your
grandfather
drank
this
is
the
one
i
would
go
for
you
can
often
find
a
12
pack
on
sale
for
around
67
it
is
what
it
is
nothing
spectacular
but
drinkable
overall
american
adjunct
pale
lagers
need
to
be
reviewed
in
their
own
terms
similar
to
the
way
the
great
roger
ebert
rip
used
to
review
bmovies
if
you
compare
this
beer
to
a
belgian
lambic
or
a
graduatedegree
level
ipa
youre
basically
comparing
evil
dead
to
a
polanski
film
or
something
they
dont
serve
the
same
purpose
nor
should
they
be
judged
by
the
same
measuring
stick
now
that
those
cards
are
on
the
table
i
drank
this
high
life
with
hot
dogs
and
watermelon
while
watching
baseball
perfect
afternoon
its
not
my
favorite
american
budget
lager
id
certainly
take
gansett
or
pabst
over
this
but
its
certainly
better
than
budweiser
and
its
better
than
a
poorly
executed
complex
beer
as
a
bonus
this
offering
is
proudly
unionmade
by
uaw
workers
o
if
ive
been
mowing
on
sunday
good
beer
is
only
had
in
liquor
stores
here
and
they
arent
open
on
sunday
this
is
my
goto
its
really
not
horrible
but
theres
just
no
comparison
to
a
good
helles
if
someone
told
me
there
were
hops
used
in
this
beer
i
may
or
may
not
believe
them
this
is
a
palatecleanser
beer
and
nearperfect
swig
after
a
hot
day
of
yard
work
its
meant
for
eating
with
a
greasy
burger
a
juicy
steak
and
mashed
potatoes
or
bbq
pork
its
bubbly
carbonation
and
light
body
cut
through
all
this
and
leave
you
refreshed
for
the
next
bite
or
renewed
for
the
next
outdoor
activity
and
thats
all
some
beer
is
supposed
to
be
look
this
stuff
is
the
america
beer
for
broke
folks
im
not
going
to
lie
heck
ive
been
to
the
point
where
my
local
walmart
was
selling
this
stuff
near
the
price
of
budweiser
and
yes
it
was
because
budweiser
was
on
sale
im
not
going
to
say
hate
this
beer
but
for
some
reason
it
is
so
hard
to
kill
its
like
putting
ur
mouth
up
to
a
drain
full
of
piss
and
saying
damn
this
stuff
acutally
gets
you
drunk
it
should
be
less
than
9
79
a
12
pack
i
understand
the
nice
bottles
and
the
hot
little
blondie
we
all
wish
we
could
of
fuked
in
highschool
was
on
the
bottle
but
still
its
not
that
great
of
a
beer
would
i
buy
it
more
probably
not
because
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
work
overtime
so
i
can
get
good
beer
i
love
this
beer
thou
still
cause
it
can
provide
me
with
a
cheap
buzz
and
its
better
than
keystone
light
and
coor
by
far
so
im
so
undecide
on
what
to
go
to
i
guess
all
i
can
say
is
quit
drinking
and
save
ur
money
for
some
good
stuff
then
you
will
appreciate
beer
more
i
waste
all
my
money
on
beer
and
i
suffer
to
drink
this
like
you
know
who
as
well
good
luck
and
god
bless
america
overall
i
was
preparing
for
an
awful
experience
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
to
drink
at
home
but
wouldnt
mind
if
its
one
of
a
few
options
at
a
party
or
something
this
is
buy
far
the
best
beer
for
your
money
tastes
great
though
maybe
not
less
filling
that
high
life
lite
you
cant
beat
that
its
tastes
good
and
i
only
pay
7
99
for
a
12ver
of
bottles
not
enough
people
appreciate
a
good
crisp
clean
american
lager
i
poo
on
the
beer
snobs
overall
this
is
a
highly
underrated
beer
if
looking
for
40oz
that
pairs
well
with
fish
chicken
or
vegetarian
meal
look
no
further
than
miller
high
life
looking
for
a
gateway
beverage
between
malt
liquor
and
craft
beer
grab
a
high
life
40
the
semisweetness
of
the
malt
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
burn
of
the
alcohol
making
this
one
of
the
most
drinkable
40s
available
o
not
much
going
on
but
its
drinkable
you
have
to
drink
this
beer
many
times
to
really
appreciate
it
because
it
is
so
unique
compared
to
other
beers
out
there
today
this
is
a
unique
take
on
old
school
american
lager
beer
this
beer
brand
has
been
around
since
1903
before
it
was
called
high
life
it
was
just
called
miller
beer
dating
back
to
the
mid
nineteenth
century
high
life
is
one
of
the
best
values
in
the
beer
world
it
costs
7
99
a
twelve
pack
all
over
town
this
used
to
be
millers
flagship
brand
think
budweiser
or
coors
banquet
until
they
decided
to
abandon
it
for
mgd
now
it
is
a
budget
beer
like
busch
or
rolling
rock
it
is
just
as
drinkable
as
those
beers
but
it
has
more
character
that
character
can
be
offputting
if
you
fail
to
understand
what
you
are
really
drinking
this
is
an
adjunct
lager
this
in
the
granddaddy
of
adjunct
lagers
it
has
corn
in
it
that
is
the
style
for
a
corn
beer
this
is
very
good
it
is
meant
for
ice
cold
drinking
you
do
not
slowly
sip
one
of
these
at
a
time
at
60
degrees
fahrenheit
you
drink
several
of
these
at
a
time
ice
cold
that
is
the
high
life
for
that
purpose
this
beer
is
outstanding
the
value
is
there
the
taste
is
there
the
approachability
is
there
comparable
to
pbr
and
similar
brews
that
being
said
ill
crush
high
life
all
day
long
10
for
an
18
pack
this
is
my
sitting
in
the
sun
white
trash
beer
of
choice
dont
overthink
it
overall
not
a
bad
beer
this
was
the
best
offering
from
a
limited
selection
in
a
small
country
store
on
the
way
back
from
a
fishing
trip
to
the
gulf
i
have
always
thought
this
beer
was
a
bargain
for
the
taste
that
is
gives
pours
a
pale
transparent
straw
yellow
color
with
a
fizzyfoamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
the
expected
grassy
musty
hops
over
a
lightly
sweet
malt
base
the
flavor
is
largely
driven
by
sweet
grainy
malts
and
a
bit
of
a
sweet
corn
character
although
the
dull
musty
hops
can
be
identified
as
well
as
with
most
in
this
style
the
light
body
and
fizzy
carbonation
help
this
one
go
down
easy
but
it
has
more
substancebody
than
others
in
this
regard
this
beer
is
not
much
different
than
the
other
massproduced
adjunct
lagers
but
it
doesnt
come
across
as
so
watery
and
bland
as
others
overall
its
a
fine
beer
to
wash
down
a
hot
dog
or
any
other
situation
where
you
just
need
a
dumb
beer
but
its
certainly
not
something
to
crave
and
savor
poured
into
an
english
pint
glass
minimal
head
appears
a
bright
clear
yellow
color
smell
is
not
inviting
the
taste
is
ok
upfront
but
has
an
unpleasant
after
taste
metallic
cant
detect
any
good
flavors
tastewise
its
pretty
watery
i
would
not
choose
to
drink
this
beer
for
any
reason
other
than
price
if
you
can
get
passed
the
sweet
corn
flavor
then
it
is
better
than
budweiser
it
definitely
stands
above
coors
however
with
both
using
corn
as
an
adjunct
for
a
long
time
i
didnt
know
the
champagne
of
beers
meant
it
was
extra
frothy
and
bubbly
but
i
always
liked
the
nice
buzz
and
the
taste
in
those
12
ounce
bottles
ice
cold
the
taste
is
awesome
like
over
carbonated
unsweetened
black
tea
and
it
leaves
a
nice
flavor
to
marinate
in
your
mouth
i
havent
had
one
of
theses
in
a
while
i
think
i
might
pick
one
up
tomorrow
for
2
bucks
a
32
you
can
make
another
trip
to
the
store
overall
this
beer
is
ok
but
very
plain
it
tastes
the
closest
to
a
light
beer
i
e
very
close
to
plain
water
of
any
macro
lager
i
have
tried
yet
this
has
been
my
favorite
american
macro
for
many
years
smell
is
light
btw
i
cant
smell
things
that
well
nice
head
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
in
its
wake
its
hard
to
nail
down
in
words
why
its
so
good
a
robust
flavor
characterized
mostly
by
corn
light
malt
and
grain
highly
carbonated
nice
dry
finish
with
no
aftertaste
tastes
like
beer
o
a
bit
harsh
in
the
mouth
this
is
an
awesome
stepping
stone
beer
yo
teens
skip
the
budmillercoors
brigade
and
start
with
this
one
pretty
awesome
aal
overall
it
is
what
it
is
run
of
the
mill
american
adjunct
lager
with
minimal
redeeming
qualities
not
sure
i
could
pick
this
out
in
a
lineup
i
drank
this
from
a
tall
boy
purchased
from
a
711
in
a
rash
decision
however
i
do
really
like
high
life
its
great
to
bring
to
parties
and
its
always
cheap
it
has
that
classic
american
golden
tan
and
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
to
suffice
its
light
and
airy
so
it
quenches
your
thirst
pretty
well
great
for
outings
hikes
parties
or
just
lounging
around
overall
maybe
it
was
because
i
was
in
a
good
mood
but
this
beer
surprised
me
it
was
clean
tasting
without
any
odd
metallic
elements
like
a
lot
of
cheap
beers
overall
pretty
average
beer
from
a
macrobrewer
and
for
the
price
i
will
say
its
an
ok
beer
and
one
i
do
drink
in
college
because
of
it
this
beer
was
actually
quite
pleasant
had
no
off
flavors
no
fruitiness
at
all
and
drank
easily
and
without
effort
it
did
not
develop
any
off
flavors
as
it
warmed
it
leaves
a
touch
of
sweetness
as
it
finishes
dry
this
one
receives
a
lot
of
hate
but
it
really
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
that
it
is
unoffensive
flavors
easy
drinking
the
hipster
in
me
really
wants
to
like
miller
high
life
but
it
is
no
means
the
champagne
of
beers
each
time
i
somehow
end
up
drinking
it
i
just
cant
get
over
a
weird
musty
flavor
that
this
beer
has
when
i
have
it
in
a
can
it
does
oddly
taste
slightly
better
than
bottled
but
still
gross
if
im
going
to
go
for
a
super
cheap
beer
i
think
im
going
to
stick
with
pbr
or
schlitz
since
they
have
actual
decent
flavor
compared
to
this
swill
o
its
literally
the
middle
of
the
pack
as
far
as
aal
goes
there
is
some
redeming
qualities
to
these
brews
but
the
ones
that
have
that
chalky
finish
and
skunky
nose
just
kill
it
for
the
rest
that
might
be
decent
i
brought
a
24
oz
can
from
a
local
bodega
i
usually
drink
craft
but
i
decided
to
give
the
champagne
of
beers
a
try
i
poured
it
into
a
wine
glass
and
was
surprised
its
golden
hue
and
bubbly
carbonation
makes
it
look
like
champagne
other
than
that
there
is
nothing
special
about
its
appearance
it
smells
rather
sweet
probably
due
to
corn
or
other
adjunct
when
it
came
to
taste
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
can
actually
taste
a
mild
hop
character
this
paired
with
its
smoothness
makes
for
a
easy
drinking
beer
while
it
is
not
my
first
choice
i
would
choose
over
other
american
macro
brew
i
sometimes
have
one
because
of
its
placement
in
the
back
to
the
future
films
and
apparently
i
need
to
type
250
characters
so
i
will
say
this
why
does
biff
complain
about
the
mcflys
only
having
lite
beer
when
hes
at
their
house
i
guess
the
product
placement
was
for
the
entire
miller
line
this
is
the
champagne
of
beers
and
for
good
reason
this
is
the
beer
of
choice
for
folks
that
just
want
to
drink
beer
those
that
want
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
double
latte
with
1
shot
of
vanilla
12
shot
of
hazelnut
and
light
foamy
milk
should
try
one
of
the
microbeers
in
your
area
however
at
its
current
price
point
packaging
and
taste
you
cannot
go
wrong
bringing
a
6
pack
of
high
lifes
to
your
best
friends
bbq
o
honestly
what
does
one
expect
for
under
2
for
32
ounces
i
have
had
worse
i
dont
really
know
anymore
somehow
this
doesnt
taste
like
complete
shit
to
me
i
was
more
bothered
by
this
when
i
was
about
2021
but
now
i
find
lager
yeast
hints
leaves
you
wishing
for
more
and
lacks
anything
all
that
enjoyable
this
is
the
only
aal
that
i
can
say
i
enjoy
while
there
is
nothing
special
about
it
there
is
also
nothing
offensive
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
almost
creamy
which
is
what
makes
this
one
for
me
its
also
cheaper
than
its
bud
coors
miller
counterparts
miller
high
is
brewed
by
miller
the
champagne
of
beer
been
around
since
1903
pours
out
a
amber
color
this
brew
has
a
white
head
that
says
the
smell
is
that
of
an
american
style
beer
the
taste
is
nothing
special
but
it
ok
nothing
bad
but
nothing
good
overall
i
give
this
a
3
not
good
but
not
bad
i
may
get
this
brew
to
switch
it
up
from
the
budweiser
products
every
once
in
awhile
dont
think
too
much
about
it
not
very
complex
but
definitely
sweeter
honey
feel
than
other
american
lagers
my
go
to
for
cheap
american
lagers
overall
that
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
can
see
why
high
life
is
considered
one
of
the
better
ones
ill
need
to
find
some
schlitz
gusto
soon
though
but
in
all
actuality
i
like
the
taste
of
miller
high
life
i
do
and
i
apologize
not
for
finding
my
taste
receptors
enjoy
a
miller
every
now
and
again
and
even
twist
a
grinder
of
chunky
sea
salt
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
on
a
frozen
winter
one
too
enhancing
this
old
american
standard
beer
much
like
a
mustard
smeared
pretzel
and
good
talk
among
long
friends
does
good
tailgater
good
summer
time
beer
worth
a
shot
but
as
usual
with
anything
other
than
craft
beers
beer
snobs
should
avoid
i
still
cant
find
schlitz
or
blatz
wherever
i
might
stop
in
but
almost
everyplace
carries
high
life
this
was
9
99
for
a
18pk
of
bottles
not
bad
i
know
clear
bottles
get
a
bad
wrap
but
i
like
the
high
life
bottle
shape
and
looking
at
this
decent
american
beer
typical
american
adjunct
lager
smell
if
that
is
what
your
type
of
beer
very
soapy
head
on
it
the
mouthfeel
is
prickly
with
carbonation
but
very
smooth
its
actually
not
the
cornveggie
aftertaste
that
miller
usually
puts
out
im
actually
surprised
for
what
it
is
a
a
l
i
could
get
youst
to
buying
this
and
drinking
it
on
a
daily
basis
plus
the
price
is
about
17
99
usd
for
a
30
pack
one
of
my
favorite
cheap
poor
mans
beer
when
im
low
on
cash
and
need
some
beer
i
always
come
back
to
high
life
a
12
pack
of
bottles
for
8
50
is
a
bargain
when
i
first
turned
drinking
age
this
was
my
choice
beer
and
thought
it
was
great
i
mean
its
still
decent
once
ive
had
about
34
beers
decent
economy
beer
if
you
are
gonna
buy
this
stuff
may
as
well
get
some
steel
reserve
or
hurricane
or
whatever
but
whatever
you
do
please
do
not
buy
that
earthquake
crap
that
is
disgusting
even
for
heavy
drinkers
for
real
no
joke
o
this
is
my
go
to
cheap
beer
overall
its
not
that
bad
of
a
product
it
does
exactly
what
i
want
it
to
at
the
right
price
it
gets
easier
to
drink
after
one
or
two
but
theres
a
good
reason
for
that
if
im
having
several
different
beers
or
going
out
i
have
to
remember
to
use
a
palate
cleanser
after
this
one
as
it
diminishes
the
taste
of
everything
after
it
theres
definitely
better
beer
out
there
but
theres
most
certainly
worse
high
life
is
not
a
beer
you
should
be
ashamed
to
serve
your
buddies
or
drink
on
the
couch
at
home
its
a
great
cheap
alternative
to
other
beers
in
its
price
range
and
knocks
some
of
them
straigh
out
of
the
park
just
dont
expect
a
fantastic
dissolution
in
your
mouth
you
will
be
disappointed
and
probably
grossed
out
m
highly
carbonated
much
like
the
16th
century
benedictine
monks
who
honed
its
namesake
tiny
bubbles
make
the
beer
refreshing
and
highly
sessionable
pours
a
golden
color
with
some
head
which
disappears
very
quickly
head
leaves
some
lacing
smell
is
almost
entirely
absent
taste
is
pretty
crisp
but
empty
carbonation
is
not
overpowering
but
provides
more
to
the
taste
than
the
malt
and
hops
thin
mouthfeel
is
mildly
bubbly
somewhat
bitter
and
rotten
after
taste
cheers
and
peace2all
tastes
like
bad
decisions
do
o
i
like
mhl
i
wouldnt
call
it
the
champagne
of
beers
but
for
an
aal
i
find
it
enjoyable
plus
i
like
that
its
available
in
40oz
i
cant
believe
i
never
rated
this
alright
this
is
the
low
brow
class
of
beers
but
i
tend
to
make
this
my
goto
water
beer
however
i
do
enjoy
the
maltiness
and
carbonation
of
this
beer
there
is
a
consistency
for
this
beer
that
makes
me
think
it
is
very
good
value
for
the
money
now
am
i
a
sucker
for
the
marketing
and
schtick
of
the
champagne
ads
oh
hell
yeah
i
like
it
a
lot
but
also
think
this
is
a
good
beer
that
shouldnt
be
the
ugly
sister
of
their
bud
lite
and
coors
lite
competition
overall
high
life
gets
a
3
for
okay
its
not
my
favorite
american
lager
but
i
can
definitely
drink
the
hell
out
of
it
the
taste
isnt
my
favorite
but
the
appearance
and
mouth
on
it
kind
of
even
it
out
for
me
this
is
a
working
class
beer
for
working
class
americans
and
it
is
a
damn
decent
product
this
is
only
good
for
those
times
when
your
on
a
beer
budget
and
anything
will
do
and
even
then
their
are
better
options
out
their
i
drank
this
straight
from
the
bottle
i
would
not
insult
my
glassware
with
it
i
guess
in
the
end
beer
is
like
sex
even
when
its
bad
its
still
pretty
good
now
thats
living
the
high
life
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
for
a
cheap
beer
i
dont
know
if
it
is
the
champagne
of
beers
but
its
not
terrible
it
is
a
very
clear
light
yellow
color
and
very
fizzy
it
does
smell
a
little
sweaty
it
also
tastes
a
little
sweaty
but
it
is
not
the
bad
type
you
usually
associate
with
that
description
o
not
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
ill
be
drinking
this
time
and
time
again
as
a
filler
beer
i
guess
m
light
and
effervescent
with
slight
astringency
in
finish
for
the
style
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
do
not
get
much
better
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
top
of
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
beer
for
me
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
light
carbonation
a
light
body
and
a
grainy
and
almost
bready
sweet
finish
that
ligers
with
some
metallic
aftertaste
notes
overall
quite
average
in
every
way
the
champagne
of
beersright
on
overall
on
its
own
not
a
great
beer
but
as
for
mass
produced
adjuncts
this
one
is
actually
quite
enjoyable
and
would
quaff
without
hesitation
if
nothing
better
was
offered
i
think
overall
this
is
definitely
a
serviceable
brew
for
the
category
i
dont
think
its
as
clean
or
perhaps
flavorless
as
bud
though
it
has
more
character
the
lingering
corn
and
metallic
flavor
almost
simulate
real
beer
flavors
almost
o
i
love
the
fact
that
i
found
this
one
in
a
32
oz
can
actually
this
is
not
as
offensive
as
some
of
the
other
bmc
offerings
as
it
actually
has
some
flavor
and
is
drinkable
best
served
ice
cold
and
it
is
a
great
outdoor
grilling
beer
when
you
are
the
guy
manning
the
grill
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
this
4th
of
july
i
salute
the
nation
with
a
solid
unionmade
brew
miller
high
life
cheers
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
foamy
head
it
looks
like
a
bad
aal
scents
of
lager
yeast
and
maize
mostly
maize
maybe
a
bit
of
malt
in
there
but
i
couldnt
really
make
it
out
this
carried
over
into
the
taste
some
yeast
a
lot
of
maize
a
hint
of
bready
malt
but
not
much
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
hit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
why
is
that
in
a
lager
even
in
an
aal
its
standard
but
that
alcohol
hit
is
an
unwelcome
change
from
the
overall
mediocrity
of
the
rest
of
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
standard
for
the
style
the
same
as
any
other
overall
its
a
standard
aal
held
back
from
mediocrity
and
thrust
into
somewhat
bad
territory
by
a
weird
alcohol
presence
and
a
low
hop
character
its
not
worth
going
back
to
for
sure
o
again
one
of
the
best
cheap
beers
there
is
i
became
very
familiar
with
this
20
years
ago
as
it
was
is
my
wifes
families
goto
beer
for
any
group
get
together
it
is
just
good
enough
in
bottles
for
me
to
shlep
around
the
long
neck
24
case
boxes
go
on
sale
here
so
it
is
a
lower
cost
beverage
the
taste
comes
across
as
slightly
burned
corn
you
must
drink
it
quick
as
it
turns
quickly
if
left
alone
best
served
very
cold
by
a
campfire
other
than
the
nestalgic
priciple
of
it
this
is
my
go
to
cheap
beer
to
tired
from
a
hard
day
of
work
to
grab
a
glass
and
pour
simply
grab
a
piece
of
the
high
life
now
excuse
me
while
i
crack
one
open
and
relax
d
miller
high
life
is
an
unoffensive
and
refreshing
american
adjunct
lager
that
would
be
perfect
at
a
summer
cookout
overall
a
fairly
decent
beer
i
just
turned
21
about
2
months
ago
and
have
been
experimenting
with
a
ton
of
beers
to
find
my
own
this
one
for
some
reason
is
my
go
too
budget
beer
good
on
a
dry
hot
day
and
great
with
pizza
haha
not
too
bad
but
far
from
the
best
good
if
you
are
on
a
budget
and
want
a
quantity
17
97
for
a
30
atmosphere
is
pretty
decent
nice
hue
pretty
good
head
and
some
fair
lacing
nose
is
light
grains
nothing
else
a
little
pungent
and
sweet
malt
tone
with
something
of
a
very
subtle
woody
character
overall
this
is
a
fair
quaff
drank
alot
of
this
in
my
formative
years
aahhh
the
glorious
results
of
a
misspent
youth
pouring
into
a
tall
pilsner
brings
up
a
frothy
foamy
white
head
with
surprisingly
nice
lacing
the
beer
itself
is
pale
yellow
and
crystal
clear
i
get
corn
sweetness
with
a
whiff
of
lager
aroma
mouthfeel
is
typical
macro
lager
thin
kinda
watery
with
pinprick
bubbly
carbonation
due
to
the
cold
serving
temp
some
corngrasshay
flavor
verrry
little
in
the
way
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
finshes
sweetwatery
but
you
know
what
youre
getting
when
you
have
this
almost
cuts
it
on
a
hot
late
spring
day
here
at
the
shore
an
ok
lawn
mowerrefreshing
type
beer
a
guilty
pleasure
when
craft
is
not
present
it
drinks
a
bit
syrupy
but
that
is
part
of
its
charm
as
it
warms
it
is
still
enjoyable
great
for
baseball
games
and
anytime
you
are
looking
for
a
cheap
beer
but
dont
care
about
the
calorie
count
overall
for
cheap
american
lager
it
is
average
at
best
i
would
buy
icehouse
pbr
schlitz
oldd
milwaukee
over
this
beer
o
for
the
price
point
this
is
my
pick
all
the
time
not
bad
just
a
typical
adjunct
lager
miller
high
life
is
one
of
my
favorite
aals
and
is
a
regular
goto
when
hot
weather
appears
me
and
my
brother
bought
a
12
pack
a
couple
months
back
and
i
have
got
to
say
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
come
across
i
typically
like
cheap
beer
too
but
this
tasted
like
piss
mixed
with
rat
poison
it
does
have
a
good
pilsner
look
the
smell
is
of
sulfer
atleast
it
was
when
i
bought
it
its
taste
was
terrible
far
too
much
carbonation
mouthfeel
like
i
previously
stated
way
to
carbonated
overall
id
drink
this
beer
if
you
bought
me
one
but
thats
the
only
time
i
would
never
going
to
buy
this
sludge
again
disclaimer
written
under
the
influence
of
a
serious
macro
lager
kick
miller
high
life
is
a
beer
i
used
to
drink
often
like
many
folks
i
switched
to
a
lite
beer
after
a
few
years
of
swilling
various
brands
of
light
beer
i
found
myself
at
a
place
that
sold
out
of
lite
so
i
ordered
a
high
life
boyohboy
was
it
good
i
had
forgotten
just
how
good
a
real
beer
tasted
since
i
never
drink
more
than
two
brews
when
i
am
driving
i
always
order
miller
high
life
now

should
be
called
low
life
or
no
life
overall
my
great
american
adjunct
lager
hunt
is
almost
finished
i
have
a
couple
more
on
my
radar
this
one
rates
up
there
with
bud
and
pbr
this
brew
is
not
great
its
just
an
adjunct
i
cant
say
anything
more
about
it
ill
come
back
to
it
in
6
months
or
a
year
and
give
it
another
shot
maybe
not
drink
beer
for
a
week
or
more
then
open
one
of
these
they
used
to
hit
the
spot
o
an
enjoyable
sessionable
cheap
aal
that
has
nothing
wrong
with
it
its
not
great
but
its
not
bad
either
i
could
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
during
a
football
game
or
sporting
event
i
thought
this
beer
was
fairly
decent
but
nothing
that
i
would
drink
all
of
the
time
it
had
a
good
taste
and
ok
smell
to
it
on
a
hot
summers
day
while
cooking
on
the
grill
i
thought
it
really
hit
the
spot
but
most
anything
probably
would
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
also
average
for
a
lager
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
my
dad
and
grandpa
would
drink
but
not
really
my
favorite
lets
all
be
honest
here
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
this
is
as
average
as
a
beer
gets
this
beer
isnt
greatideal
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
either
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
very
simple
as
well
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
with
any
particular
flavor
in
my
mind
the
can
can
use
work
as
well
as
it
could
be
more
attractive
ps
was
my
first
review
on
this
fantastic
forum
to
all
who
are
concerned
keep
up
the
fantastic
work
i
love
this
place
and
all
the
info
i
have
retrieved
from
it
what
i
remember
from
my
wayward
youth
still
would
chose
the
king
of
beers
when
buying
this
style
but
would
enjoy
on
a
hot
georgia
afternoon
overall
a
lot
better
than
what
i
remember
which
has
got
to
be
a
good
8
or
so
years
still
not
a
beer
id
buy
unless
options
were
severely
limited
like
on
a
deserted
island
limited
alright
maybe
not
that
bad
but
you
get
the
point
o
not
a
beer
with
much
depth
but
for
a
lighter
cheaper
beer
i
think
it
is
very
tasty
i
will
continue
buying
because
it
is
cheap
and
widely
available
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
exactly
like
a
miller
golden
yellow
beer
should
but
its
the
carbonation
that
i
just
love
makes
it
feel
so
alive
ive
never
been
a
smooth
beer
drinker
so
miller
high
life
is
the
perfect
match
for
this
guy
cheers
to
livin
the
high
life
in
my
opinion
id
say
that
the
miller
high
life
is
potentially
the
best
tasting
beer
that
the
miller
brewing
co
makes
thats
not
to
say
its
a
great
beer
but
lets
face
it
if
i
had
to
choose
amongst
the
typical
miller
brands
it
would
probably
be
this
as
far
as
flavor
its
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
decent
it
certainly
isnt
anywhere
near
the
best
but
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
beer
is
light
and
watery
with
a
strong
grainy
aftertaste
that
really
dominated
the
beer
on
the
taste
side
of
things
it
is
otherwise
flavorless
and
the
aftertaste
is
really
unpleasant
i
sort
of
hate
it
the
second
and
third
drink
do
not
improve
the
beer
and
the
after
taste
goes
more
vegetal
until
it
tastes
like
im
drinking
cream
corn
and
boiled
cabbage
nope
not
a
repeat
d
easy
to
drink
with
mild
flavors
and
a
good
wash
of
crispness
a
tasty
american
lager
o
welp
its
a
high
life
the
champagne
of
beers
o
high
life
is
bland
on
all
counts
but
close
to
par
for
the
style
it
would
be
refreshing
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
not
very
enjoyable
for
much
else
its
not
the
worse
but
you
can
to
much
better
my
other
go
to
beer
when
i
need
a
change
of
pace
from
coors
banquet
i
go
with
mhl
a
great
summer
beer
when
your
bbqing
or
hanging
out
at
the
river
tastes
great
mhl
in
the
bottle
is
great
cans
arent
bad
either
but
the
bottled
mhl
tastes
better
to
me
i
love
the
classic
look
also
as
bad
as
miller
light
is
mhl
is
that
good
lol
final
thoughts
eh
its
your
basic
macrolager
not
much
to
like
but
not
the
worst
of
its
kind
this
will
always
be
my
go
to
beer
along
with
pbr
i
enjoy
euro
pale
lagers
micro
brews
and
craft
beers
but
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
the
high
life
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
clear
finish
its
slightly
musty
and
some
corn
sweetness
round
it
out
honestly
there
aint
much
here
but
what
there
is
does
not
offend
my
delicate
sensibilities
as
much
as
i
had
expected
overall
this
beer
does
what
it
intends
well
it
is
light
inoffensive
beery
tasting
beer
plus
you
can
get
a
six
pack
of
pint
cans
for
around
5
not
too
shabby
taste
is
typical
macro
with
a
little
more
malty
breadiness
and
a
noticeable
semidryness
very
nice
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
noncraft
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
but
still
has
at
least
a
smidge
of
complexity
in
the
malt
profile
if
youre
a
lager
fan
this
is
an
excellent
choice
if
youre
an
elitist
you
probably
wont
like
it
never
liked
this
beer
and
still
dont
like
it
when
rating
it
plenty
of
better
options
o
not
bad
for
a
macro
beer
could
do
a
lot
worse
o
it
is
what
it
is
but
one
of
the
lesser
offensive
of
the
ubiquitous
bmc
products
taste
starts
lightly
sweet
bitterness
and
some
saccharin
in
the
middle
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
yet
thin
and
drinkability
is
good
if
this
is
what
youre
looking
for
since
you
bought
it
one
would
think
you
know
what
to
expect
overall
certainly
nothing
special
but
not
too
shabby
not
bad
as
an
economical
beer
o
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
better
drinking
it
out
of
the
bottle
than
a
glass
good
beer
for
after
a
had
days
work
in
the
summertime
probably
one
of
the
best
highly
distributed
beers
out
there
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
and
yet
is
refreshing
and
crisp
ends
with
a
clean
finish
and
you
cant
beat
the
price
i
dont
always
drink
sub
premium
but
when
i
do
i
drink
the
champagne
of
sub
premium
beer
miller
high
life
claims
to
be
the
champagne
of
beers
is
it
true
lets
find
out
pick
up
a
30
pack
of
this
and
a
30
pack
of
regular
miller
lite
for
a
party
i
first
drank
the
miller
lite
they
tried
one
of
these
for
the
first
time
its
your
average
lager
yellow
with
no
real
smells
to
speak
off
with
the
typical
carbonation
but
the
taste
the
taste
for
the
type
of
beer
it
is
was
wonderful
sooo
easy
to
drink
sooo
smooth
and
it
was
a
steal
at
16
for
the
30
its
a
nice
change
here
and
there
from
my
usual
pabst
although
pabst
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
i
had
some
of
this
however
in
the
light
version
along
with
colt
45
the
first
time
i
had
ever
gotten
drunk
and
i
strongly
preferred
it
to
the
others
in
the
cooler
and
this
even
beats
out
the
light
edition
wish
i
would
have
known
about
this
stuff
as
a
teenager
would
have
wasted
less
money
on
bud
light
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
that
this
style
has
to
offer
mhl
is
a
good
beer
at
a
good
price
although
it
puts
up
with
a
lot
of
slanderous
comments
i
dont
think
there
is
a
thing
wrong
with
this
brew
when
you
factor
in
its
limitations
and
at
1
a
pint
seriously
i
would
buy
it
and
i
will
drink
it
again
for
sure
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
with
a
12
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
corn
flakes
and
some
sugarlike
aromas
taste
is
of
grain
and
sweetened
corn
flakes
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
but
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
the
feel
isnt
bad
light
for
what
i
like
but
not
terribly
light
even
almost
verging
toward
medium
in
the
light
body
crispness
is
there
but
not
overly
spritzy
theres
even
a
little
smoothness
overall
recommended
if
youre
on
a
budget
or
hosting
a
party
that
may
consist
of
folks
that
are
simply
not
on
your
level
of
sophistication
for
whatever
reason
miller
high
life
out
of
the
bottle
seems
by
my
judgment
much
less
flavorful
and
more
subdued
than
when
i
drink
from
or
out
of
a
can
its
still
a
good
beer
but
i
think
id
prefer
it
from
the
can
which
is
opposite
from
my
usual
preference
for
other
beers
o
well
it
sucks
typical
aal
tastes
like
corn
water
smells
like
gym
socks
the
body
is
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
loads
of
visible
carbonation
i
drank
mine
from
the
can
but
others
at
this
backyard
shindig
poured
theirs
into
a
glass
the
aroma
is
of
corn
and
grains
maybe
a
little
green
apple
the
flavor
profile
mimics
the
nose
green
apple
skins
corn
starch
and
grains
extremely
bland
lacking
any
real
flavors
lightbodied
high
carbonation
this
is
probably
a
little
more
palatable
than
others
in
its
style
but
it
is
still
not
very
desireable
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
straw
color
like
any
other
adjunct
lager
with
a
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
with
some
lacing
smells
of
adjunct
grain
especially
corn
really
sweet
sweet
malty
taste
dominates
probably
from
the
corn
used
but
actually
has
taste
unlike
many
adjuncts
this
light
bodied
beer
has
full
taste
can
go
down
really
easily
and
is
not
over
carbonated
overall
an
average
beer
but
better
than
most
adjuncts
official
beer
of
me
word
overall
this
beer
does
the
job
time
after
time
after
time
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
nothing
to
turn
my
nose
up
too
and
the
price
is
always
right
overall
im
not
too
fond
of
this
beer
lol
a
boring
beer
with
just
enough
taste
to
make
it
palatable
somewhere
between
a
light
and
adjunct
lager
in
taste
and
body
while
not
a
beer
i
would
refuse
if
offered
this
is
also
not
something
i
would
imbibe
of
my
own
volition
quite
simply
there
are
better
beers
in
the
same
price
range
or
cheaper
overall
for
a
classic
american
adjunct
lager
i
must
say
that
it
is
difficult
to
complain
about
this
one
its
been
around
since
my
grandfather
was
born
and
he
probably
drank
it
out
of
a
bottle
with
a
pacifier
instead
of
milk
as
an
infant
hell
for
3
99
a
six
and
the
significant
amount
of
quality
time
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
id
have
to
say
its
miller
time
even
though
i
enjoy
brewing
my
own
beer
as
well
this
is
good
inbetween
beer
what
can
i
say
union
made
last
time
i
checked
my
go
to
high
volume
beer
o
a
good
cheap
beer
kick
sessionable
nice
can
solid
retro
offering
goes
down
nice
after
cutting
the
lawn
on
a
hot
day
overall
its
a
nice
cheaper
beer
one
of
my
gotos
the
other
being
pabst
but
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
bachelor
or
a
college
student
on
a
budget
like
myself
a
lawnmower
beer
overall
not
to
bad
for
an
amarican
lager
poured
a
pint
can
into
a
glass
mug
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
towering
white
head
the
head
does
dissipate
but
it
leaves
a
nice
cap
on
top
with
some
lacing
around
the
edge
there
are
plenty
of
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
corn
there
is
some
mild
hop
aroma
as
well
but
its
hard
to
detect
the
flavors
of
grainy
barley
malt
and
slightly
sweet
corn
are
the
dominant
flavors
the
hops
are
very
mild
the
body
is
light
and
it
is
abundantly
carbonated
its
crisp
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
solid
adjunct
lager
that
is
good
for
a
tailgate
a
fishing
trip
a
picnic
or
just
for
a
nice
summer
day
when
you
have
the
barbecue
pit
going
for
the
price
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
serving
type
ontap
but
equally
good
in
bottle
not
as
nice
in
a
can
final
grade
3
09
in
the
c
range
this
stuff
is
apparently
available
in
canada
though
i
have
never
actually
seen
it
advertised
anywhere
and
if
its
anything
like
mgd
its
probably
too
expensive
to
be
worth
it
anyway
that
being
said
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
some
of
this
at
the
duty
free
the
next
time
i
return
from
a
stateside
trip
id
certainly
take
this
over
many
canadian
macros
o
i
was
surprised
when
i
revisited
this
college
standard
for
vaguelyclassy
cheap
drunks
it
was
much
better
than
expected
that
said
its
only
for
pizza
not
for
session
drinkability
it
is
not
much
but
it
is
cheap
and
decent
its
a
good
lawnmower
or
tailgating
beer
something
light
and
straightforward
to
provide
a
good
buzz
before
a
game
reviewed
on
31712
overall
since
i
paid
1
50
for
32
oz
what
should
i
expect
slightly
subpar
in
comparison
to
the
standard
american
adjunct
lager
o
very
drinkable
and
better
than
most
adjuncts
its
a
small
upgrade
from
miller
genuine
draft
however
in
cans
in
the
states
this
beer
is
crisp
smooth
and
delicious
as
long
as
its
cold
this
is
a
thirst
quenching
but
boring
beer
theres
nothing
good
about
it
theres
nothing
really
bad
about
it
o
a
pretty
solid
light
lager
and
definitely
one
that
is
a
people
pleaser
at
a
summer
day
or
evening
easy
to
drink
with
enough
enjoyment
along
the
way
what
do
you
do
when
75
cent
busch
light
bottles
run
out
replace
them
with
miller
high
life
looks
better
than
regular
bmc
products
and
smells
slightly
more
citrusy
as
well
but
far
from
good
tastes
old
and
stale
which
is
somewhat
of
a
let
down
but
overall
its
doable
follow
your
normal
free
beer
rules
with
this
i
wouldnt
even
do
beer
pong
or
tailgate
with
this
beer
i
could
easily
knock
back
several
of
these
at
a
party
and
it
is
ridiculously
cheap
so
i
suppose
it
does
have
its
place
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
unless
im
broke
pretty
decent
for
an
american
schwag
beer
definitely
my
go
to
when
trying
to
keep
it
econo
especially
with
the
price
of
mexi
beers
which
have
skyrocketed
in
san
diego
over
the
past
5
years
good
for
tailgating
and
all
day
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
get
rid
of
the
nasty
cleanser
flavor
that
is
so
consistent
with
this
one
and
youve
got
a
pretty
darn
good
american
lager
until
then
though
pretty
average
o
i
can
understand
why
people
drink
this
stuff
its
super
easy
to
drink
not
much
flavor
so
it
doesnt
offend
and
its
easy
on
the
wallet
i
have
had
a
lot
of
bad
beers
in
my
life
but
i
would
say
that
this
is
actually
one
of
the
better
adjunct
beers
o
another
easy
drinking
macro
i
dont
understand
why
people
find
these
so
offensive
if
anything
they
are
the
exact
opposite
bland
low
in
alcohol
and
easy
to
know
back
and
entire
six
pack
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
in
my
opinion
and
cheaper
overall
i
personally
would
not
purchase
this
beer
not
to
knock
on
miller
but
i
do
drink
before
i
look
anything
up
and
this
is
nothing
crazy
no
need
to
disrespect
but
if
you
consider
yourself
a
beer
connoisseur
you
have
to
be
a
low
life
to
like
the
high
life
salud
opretty
good
beer
for
how
cheap
it
is
dads
beer
classic
clear
bottle
great
label
not
much
nose
beery
taste
clean
probably
the
best
mouthfeel
among
all
american
adjuncts
sudsy
good
old
fashioned
beer
i
like
it
it
reminds
me
of
how
things
were
in
the
60s
i
would
keep
a
few
bottles
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
champagne
of
beers
poured
into
flute
looks
like
cheap
champagne
soapy
head
gone
at
2nd
glance
not
ugly
but
watery
clear
w
slight
gold
tint
smell
is
bare
with
faint
sweet
malts
taste
isnt
terrible
not
much
to
speak
of
though
just
a
sweetness
and
alcohol
burn
bubbly
kinda
watery
but
drinkable
overall
not
a
disagreeably
flavored
beer
for
me
but
certainly
on
the
bland
side
as
such
it
probably
hits
the
mark
for
an
american
macro
lager
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
and
in
fact
i
chose
it
over
about
6
other
macros
ultimately
though
it
lacks
substance
yeah
well
ya
know
i
drink
this
more
than
i
should
o
for
the
style
this
is
pretty
good
i
dont
mind
a
bottle
or
two
of
these
unfortunately
whatever
they
put
in
this
brew
will
usually
lead
to
a
headache
for
me
if
i
hit
the
45
range
this
might
be
a
popular
choise
for
say
college
students
because
it
is
cheap
by
no
means
do
i
think
it
is
that
good
just
a
less
expensive
knock
off
than
miller
lite
hops
are
non
existant
faint
taste
of
corn
easy
to
drink
beer
poor
choice
unless
you
are
looking
for
a
cheap
and
easy
drunken
binge
nothing
great
overall
its
great
among
the
adjunct
lagers
its
cheap
for
a
32
ounce
container
also
if
you
want
to
just
get
drunk
but
without
drinking
a
nasty
beer
this
one
is
good
i
like
it
but
its
not
something
that
i
drink
all
the
time
as
i
like
a
robust
character
lager
if
you
like
any
of
the
adjunct
lager
try
this
one
its
a
slight
step
above
the
rest
im
sure
almost
everyone
knows
what
the
american
adjunct
lagers
are
all
about
this
one
has
more
to
offer
than
some
ive
had
for
double
the
price
even
e
g
heineken
i
rarely
drink
adjunct
lagers
but
when
i
do
i
prefer
high
life
its
affordable
and
still
reasonably
tasty
got
some
left
over
from
a
party
i
threw
the
other
night
so
why
not
throw
a
review
up
here
you
know
what
color
this
is
golden
it
pours
with
a
two
finger
head
and
has
an
actual
reasonable
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
some
harsh
corn
bready
notes
and
that
wet
dog
thing
i
always
get
from
these
brews
the
taste
is
actually
quite
reasonable
for
the
style
it
goes
down
very
easily
with
just
a
bit
of
corn
mineral
taste
then
finishes
with
a
bready
aftertaste
just
enough
taste
to
remind
you
its
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
very
brisk
cmon
its
the
champagne
of
beers
overall
i
really
like
high
life
for
what
it
is
as
a
cheap
staple
beer
its
really
easy
to
do
worse
itll
handily
beat
out
most
common
import
lagers
corona
stella
you
know
what
kinda
beers
im
talking
about
at
a
third
the
price
o
a
decent
adjunct
lager
i
prefer
it
over
beers
like
budweiser
coors
etc
for
its
style
its
a
good
beer
overall
this
beer
is
not
spectacular
but
it
is
what
it
is
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
adjunct
lagers
overall
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
seeking
this
out
but
if
handed
it
at
a
party
id
still
drink
it
but
just
for
the
buzz
session
beer
look
no
further
all
the
hipsters
may
love
their
pbr
until
their
dying
day
but
that
just
means
that
theres
more
of
this
for
me
everyone
has
their
guilty
pleasure
and
this
is
mine
champagne
tends
to
go
down
easily
and
effortlessly
and
thats
the
case
with
this
too
some
of
us
know
the
deal
that
comes
with
living
the
high
life
and
were
ok
with
that
theres
a
good
reason
why
this
has
been
around
for
over
a
century
o
not
bad
for
an
adjunct
lager
nothing
really
bad
about
it
but
nothing
really
good
either
serve
cold
t
while
it
might
not
be
as
bad
as
some
of
the
adjuncts
out
there
its
far
from
being
good
has
a
strange
breadiness
towards
the
finish
that
was
pretty
nasty
better
than
bud
light
but
doesnt
top
too
much
else
o
well
its
not
bud
light
but
its
pretty
bad
the
smell
alone
makes
me
not
want
to
drink
it
if
you
want
great
pilsner
taste
try
warsteiner
premium
verum
or
pilsner
urquell
i
drank
about
half
of
it
before
drainpouring
the
rest
even
if
its
cheap
id
rather
have
a
lower
quantity
of
something
decent
than
this
not
recommended
the
commercials
for
miller
high
life
are
awesome
the
beer
is
not
quite
as
good
as
the
commercials
best
way
to
describe
it
is
servicable
the
beer
pours
yellowgolden
clear
with
big
carbonation
and
bubblely
head
to
start
then
it
fades
the
smell
and
taste
are
common
to
all
american
adjunct
lagers
wheatbarleygrain
with
balance
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
fine
it
beer
no
out
of
the
ordinary
flavors
to
twangs
overall
its
a
good
session
beer
cheers
of
course
the
real
question
is
would
you
want
to
i
know
i
dont
high
life
the
so
called
champagne
of
beers
is
your
typical
adjunct
lager
pours
a
pale
straw
color
the
head
dissipates
into
nothing
after
a
few
seconds
the
liquor
store
near
me
sells
these
in
40s
and
32
oz
cans
the
taste
is
of
corn
there
is
an
aftertaste
which
consists
of
corn
and
rice
overall
this
is
my
go
to
cheap
beer
o
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
its
not
my
first
choice
but
when
im
running
low
on
funds
itll
do
im
usually
not
a
miller
guy
i
find
miller
light
to
have
an
odd
after
taste
that
ive
always
attributed
to
their
pilsner
style
but
high
life
doesnt
have
it
it
may
have
a
small
trace
of
it
but
it
balances
out
with
the
adjuncts
and
slight
malty
profile
to
work
well
overall
i
would
consider
this
a
tailgate
or
pizza
beer
it
also
works
well
on
a
tight
budget
is
it
the
best
macro
beer
no
that
title
belongs
to
narragansett
is
it
great
bangforyourbuck
beer
you
bet
overall
its
decent
for
the
style
if
i
have
to
choose
a
bmc
product
to
drink
its
high
life
dr
very
drinkable
and
quite
cheap
you
could
do
far
worse
at
this
price
but
if
youre
doing
budget
beer
for
getting
bollocksed
i
recommend
high
gravity
steel
reserve
i
will
put
this
lager
up
with
my
other
favorite
macro
lagers
in
american
pabst
and
schlitz
clean
easy
drinking
lager
that
is
perfect
for
hotter
weather
yes
nothing
in
this
beer
is
over
done
but
that
is
why
many
like
it
just
clean
easy
drinking
with
no
nasty
after
taste
just
good
balance
for
the
style
a
beer
with
a
devoted
following
that
sometimes
verges
on
pbrish
irony
its
redeeming
qualities
are
few
and
far
between
with
the
bottle
being
the
best
part
as
i
said
before
easy
drinking
but
surprisingly
filling
more
flavorful
than
some
of
its
peers
but
still
a
pretty
flimsy
flavor
profile
i
dont
mind
a
high
life
when
im
offered
but
i
dont
think
ive
ever
been
in
the
mood
for
one
o
my
summer
mowing
pool
cleaning
landscaping
window
installing
fence
painting
house
staining
deck
building
beer
it
is
a
decent
clean
brew
that
must
be
drunk
cold
and
quick
abalanced
mix
of
cornmalthops
equal
a
neutral
taste
and
aroma
recommend
having
it
when
washing
down
a
big
mac
this
beer
had
a
clear
yellow
color
with
visible
carbonation
and
a
small
head
that
went
away
rather
quickly
smell
was
of
metallic
grains
and
corns
the
taste
was
a
bit
stale
with
the
typical
watery
corn
flavor
with
inconsistent
feel
overall
this
beer
has
the
well
known
characteristics
of
your
typical
adjunct
lager
p
s
40oz
to
freedom
d
back
in
the
day
i
would
drink
this
like
water
very
crisp
and
refreshing
though
that
are
its
only
strong
points
tastes
of
corn
with
a
slight
citrus
ting
in
the
carbonation
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
then
gives
way
to
sweet
bread
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
mass
produced
adjunct
slightly
better
than
the
others
i
will
drink
this
until
my
income
increases
greatly
for
now
heres
to
living
the
high
life
average
macro
lager
to
the
nth
degree
fizzy
bright
gold
white
frothy
lacing
corn
and
husky
grain
aroma
some
light
mineral
notes
lightly
sweet
with
minimal
bitterness
minor
flavors
of
wet
grain
honey
and
butter
crackers
dry
and
crisp
finish
but
largely
bland
and
inoffensive
gaseous
and
fizzy
carbonation
not
something
id
really
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
unlesss
circumstances
dictated
such
as
a
family
wedding
in
this
case
when
i
need
to
go
for
a
macro
pils
i
invariably
pick
this
one
over
all
others
pours
a
light
yellowish
color
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
that
does
not
stick
around
too
long
smell
is
of
grain
and
then
another
dose
of
grain
taste
is
not
very
complex
with
a
nice
non
overpowering
malt
sweetness
slight
hop
flavor
in
the
background
and
a
nice
crisp
finish
on
the
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
that
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
when
i
dont
want
something
too
complex
and
just
a
refreshing
brew
on
a
hot
day
ill
take
this
over
any
other
macro
any
day
of
the
week
the
appearance
is
the
best
score
because
it
comes
in
a
stylish
bottle
the
rest
is
self
explanatory
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
high
carbonation
levels
would
be
very
drinkable
if
the
flavor
wasnt
quite
so
offputting
definitely
one
of
the
better
options
when
it
comes
to
adjuncts
but
still
not
something
i
would
touch
if
i
really
had
a
choice
champagne
of
beers
sure
why
the
hell
not
in
a
market
where
bud
is
the
king
of
beer
this
only
makes
soulkilling
sense
since
i
didnt
grow
up
and
throw
up
with
this
particular
icon
i
have
no
such
justification
for
giving
this
nostalgia
points
a
bland
albeit
generally
inoffensive
allamerican
lager
there
lynch
mob
averted
please
pardon
my
french
but
i
feel
strongly
about
these
damn
bubbles
its
refreshing
all
right
the
downside
is
there
are
some
offflavors
that
i
dont
like
in
my
beer
they
dont
predominate
like
in
some
macros
but
they
are
there
just
enough
to
make
this
a
weak
substitute
for
a
victory
pils
or
any
number
of
fine
craft
lagers
one
can
find
easily
enough
o
if
this
is
the
champagne
of
beers
then
it
is
j
roget
well
for
years
now
the
lady
on
the
moon
has
been
my
saturady
afternoon
cheap
beer
booty
call
cannot
tell
if
it
looks
better
than
it
tastes
or
the
other
way
around
smells
sweet
like
most
straw
colored
beers
in
this
style
taste
is
not
so
bad
with
just
enough
carb
to
make
stand
out
from
my
other
swillin
beers
can
drink
this
one
all
afternoon
or
morning
for
that
matter
solid
beer
to
share
with
the
general
public
miller
high
life
is
about
the
same
as
any
other
american
lager
to
me
they
are
all
about
the
same
i
bought
a
case
of
it
to
just
try
to
save
some
money
and
though
its
not
terrible
there
is
nothing
unique
or
special
about
it
i
will
probably
buy
yuengling
if
i
am
looking
for
a
cheaper
lager
or
even
schlitz
both
have
more
of
an
interesting
flavor
than
this
beer
about
the
same
as
bud
coors
or
any
other
miller
offering
if
you
ask
me
but
good
on
a
hot
day
and
cheap
if
you
are
pinching
pennies
o
my
beer
of
choice
for
beer
pong
use
it
for
tailgating
parties
or
maybe
by
the
pool
its
cheap
smooth
and
refreshing
but
absolutely
nothing
special
probably
better
than
all
of
the
other
pale
lagers
ive
tried
but
would
only
buy
because
of
the
price
and
not
the
flavor
it
is
slightly
sweet
and
smells
of
grains
tastes
pretty
much
like
it
smells
decent
aftertaste
i
prefer
mgd
i
always
drink
beer
it
is
delicious
i
drink
macros
and
micros
and
they
all
have
a
time
and
place
its
summer
that
means
having
friends
over
and
hittin
the
pool
its
hot
and
my
names
harry
and
i
like
to
party
i
know
for
a
fact
that
people
reviewing
the
high
life
negatively
do
not
party
great
summer
beer
drink
it
yellow
and
full
of
carbonation
big
amount
of
fluffy
white
head
that
turned
into
a
thin
blanket
across
the
top
nose
is
light
grainy
lemon
and
grass
not
much
going
on
and
it
also
smells
a
little
sour
taste
is
the
same
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
sour
grainy
off
lemon
light
body
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
finishes
crisp
and
a
subtle
dryness
only
suitable
for
pounding
with
at
a
frat
partypubcrawlbeirut
tournament
or
when
there
are
dollar
drafts
its
just
plainol
beer
i
could
really
end
the
review
there
but
i
wont
the
brew
is
a
fizzy
straw
gold
like
most
beer
produced
on
earth
the
nose
is
just
beery
with
sweet
corn
adjunct
popping
out
a
bit
and
small
mineral
notes
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
except
that
the
feel
and
the
flavor
are
intrinsically
linked
the
bright
prickly
nature
of
the
brew
enhances
the
otherwise
slight
flavor
overall
average
not
as
good
as
the
draft
version
which
is
unpasteurized
this
is
just
a
bad
tasting
beer
the
commercials
and
high
life
name
got
me
excited
which
is
why
i
tried
it
this
was
not
a
good
idea
miller
markets
this
product
like
its
some
high
end
beer
but
it
tastes
like
an
extremely
below
average
getdrunkquick
beer
there
is
no
way
that
i
could
sip
and
enjoy
this
product
easy
to
drink
if
you
have
nothing
else
on
hand
the
cheap
alternative
is
my
nick
name
for
this
beer
it
definitely
drinks
easy
and
taste
is
non
existent
but
when
you
want
beer
and
you
only
have
4
or
so
here
is
your
product
are
you
having
a
party
and
plan
on
being
bored
here
you
go
they
do
support
the
troops
though
and
make
good
commercials
but
a
beer
should
be
more
than
that
how
did
they
make
this
stuff
but
then
also
make
a
master
piece
with
mgd
o
i
just
like
drinking
the
champagne
of
beers
so
if
i
need
a
pitcher
of
something
i
like
to
live
the
highlife
on
occasion
not
the
worst
of
the
macro
brews
and
actually
kind
of
tolerable
with
some
popcorn
this
is
something
i
have
drank
plenty
of
at
parties
etc
but
when
sitting
down
to
review
it
i
realize
this
isnt
one
of
the
good
adjunct
lagers
the
main
appeal
for
me
is
the
price
i
will
still
drink
this
in
mass
amounts
when
the
time
comes
but
i
wouldnt
just
choose
to
buy
this
for
myself
o
for
the
price
and
in
comparison
to
just
about
all
other
bmc
offerings
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
no
marketing
gimmicks
that
drive
up
prices
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
crap
so
i
feel
they
should
get
rid
of
the
slogan
champagne
of
beer
noe
that
some
breweries
are
a
tually
making
beers
with
champagne
yeast
in
them
the
high
life
poured
out
no
different
than
it
appears
in
the
bottle
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
of
malts
and
corn
the
taste
gives
off
the
same
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
isnt
even
that
refreshing
overall
for
me
its
a
picnic
beer
nothing
special
about
it
if
a
bee
or
other
bugs
gets
caught
in
the
can
you
can
just
throw
it
away
without
worrying
if
you
knock
it
over
its
not
a
big
deal
theres
like
29
more
cans
in
the
cooler
its
a
non
stress
beer
you
dont
haveto
worry
about
anything
when
drinkin
it
the
best
way
to
drink
high
life
is
straight
outta
the
bottle
as
cold
as
possible
without
freezing
this
beer
is
light
and
fizzy
without
a
lot
of
flavor
at
all
there
is
a
frightening
amount
of
metallic
chemically
taste
if
you
allow
it
to
warm
so
slug
it
back
quick
while
its
cold
not
bad
if
compared
to
other
aals
this
probably
falls
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
overall
when
i
think
of
the
high
life
i
think
of
in
this
order
brother
jer
bad
gas
and
a
case
that
costs
half
of
what
i
usually
spend
still
yuenglings
price
iss
comparable
and
sentimentality
cannot
offset
the
fact
that
this
beer
pairs
best
with
popcorn
and
silo
cups
i
love
this
beer
tastes
crisp
and
refreshing
especially
when
served
cold
and
drank
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
is
a
great
value
for
the
price
16
wo
tax
for
24
bottles
and
it
a
beer
i
can
drink
all
day
while
doing
yard
work
watching
sports
or
grilling
out
goes
pretty
well
with
any
meat
the
only
thing
that
will
ruin
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
the
warmer
it
gets
the
worse
it
starts
to
taste
not
a
very
full
flavor
tastes
watered
down
and
weak
it
doesnt
seem
to
hold
its
own
even
against
the
water
the
corn
additive
is
the
most
prevelant
flavor
in
this
one
but
its
weak
and
only
ends
up
leaving
an
iffy
aftertaste
considering
the
bubbliness
and
style
i
expected
more
carbonation
that
added
up
to
a
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
when
in
reality
its
on
the
creamy
side
not
a
good
beer
but
a
classic
in
american
history
and
everybody
should
at
least
give
it
a
chance
this
is
a
beer
thats
better
in
bottles
got
a
12
pack
of
bottles
for
7
bucks
not
a
great
beer
but
not
a
bad
one
either
but
they
brew
it
local
so
i
am
supporting
the
economy
o
overall
this
is
possibly
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
my
life
ive
only
drank
a
handful
of
these
in
the
past
because
even
in
my
macro
brew
days
i
steered
clear
of
my
fathers
beer
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
the
can
i
picked
up
has
a
pretty
lady
on
it
honestly
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
i
get
metal
and
corn
i
believe
this
will
be
my
last
in
my
lifetime
cheers
like
a
decent
champagne
it
is
light
and
refreshing
due
to
a
slightly
higher
carbonation
not
a
chemically
altered
lite
beer
but
its
not
going
wow
you
with
a
complex
flavor
this
is
a
basic
beer
for
celebrating
the
simple
victories
in
life
like
mowing
the
lawn
or
building
a
deck
the
oldest
miller
brand
a
simple
beer
from
a
simpler
time
definitely
not
a
replacement
for
pbr
ill
drink
the
rest
of
the
sixer
and
would
probably
accept
it
before
most
of
the
light
beers
at
a
party
but
this
is
definitely
a
pass
if
you
really
like
corny
sweetness
in
your
beer
it
might
be
up
your
alley
drink
it
cold
drink
it
fast
before
it
warms
up
man
what
a
stellar
example
of
what
the
champagne
of
beers
should
taste
like
that
was
sarcasm
but
this
stuff
aint
all
that
bad
as
you
can
see
from
the
picture
it
is
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
fizzy
head
it
has
very
little
smell
slightly
metalic
but
you
have
to
try
really
hard
to
get
any
kind
of
smell
the
taste
isnt
terrible
there
is
the
metallic
taste
from
the
smell
then
i
get
the
feeling
as
if
i
am
drinking
corn
its
just
a
regular
thin
watery
mouthfeel
of
a
cheap
beer
overall
this
is
what
i
drink
if
im
recovering
from
something
really
active
or
i
just
want
to
drink
with
my
friends
and
i
have
no
money
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
beer
however
if
you
find
yourself
knee
deep
in
a
wooded
area
in
the
backwoods
of
alabama
and
you
hear
hank
williams
jr
blaring
from
two
12
inch
speakers
hoisted
in
the
bed
of
a
1984
chevrolet
silverado
then
go
ahead
feel
confident
to
drink
one
o
not
terrible
easy
drinking
and
cheap
it
was
1
50
for
a
pint
better
than
many
bmc
products
long
live
the
high
life
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
pleasant
bubbles
and
a
delicate
tiny
white
head
nice
right
weak
aroma
of
grains
and
skunk
thin
tasting
with
minerals
and
stale
grains
metallic
and
a
skunky
aftertaste
light
fizzy
and
a
very
weak
drinkability
to
be
avoided
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
fat
soapy
head
of
shock
white
fizz
i
debated
the
rating
here
but
the
aroma
is
slightly
above
average
for
macro
swill
sugar
cookie
and
corn
with
the
faintest
suggestion
of
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
much
like
the
nose
sugar
cookie
up
front
with
faint
bitterness
and
a
squeaky
clean
finish
light
bodied
and
effervescent
certainly
drinkable
but
unremarkable
othis
brew
has
overtaken
bud
as
my
go
to
beer
when
i
want
something
simple
and
easy
to
drink
that
wont
fill
me
up
and
wont
disappoint
drinkabilityoverall
a
decent
average
beer
nothing
good
or
bad
to
really
say
about
it
certainly
not
the
worst
ajunct
lager
you
could
choose
on
a
hot
summer
day
priced
right
and
no
ill
aftertaste
just
not
much
taste
at
all
d
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
flavorless
end
of
the
spectrum
i
like
how
it
feels
in
the
mouth
but
there
just
isnt
enough
flavor
to
go
along
with
it
i
would
choose
mgd
over
this
o
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
crisp
and
clean
with
no
noticeable
off
flavors
other
than
the
faint
sourness
if
youre
trying
to
pair
this
with
anything
id
stick
to
basics
such
as
a
burger
pizza
hot
dog
etc
cheers
overall
a
decent
lager
for
an
adjunct
and
probably
the
best
bmc
product
out
there
pours
a
weak
one
finger
head
that
will
be
gone
in
seconds
the
body
is
completely
transparent
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
is
yellow
in
color
it
looks
like
it
might
be
leaving
decent
lacing
thought
well
see
miller
is
funny
because
it
actually
kind
of
tastes
like
champagne
on
the
smell
thats
exactly
what
i
get
a
champagne
smell
very
sour
maybe
even
berry
smell
to
it
i
mean
is
it
the
best
smell
ever
no
but
its
not
a
bad
smell
and
its
very
unique
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
also
let
it
be
noted
that
i
do
not
get
that
much
skunk
on
the
smell
which
is
good
considering
its
a
clear
bottle
the
taste
is
interesting
i
get
almost
no
skunk
which
is
mind
boggling
i
dont
know
how
that
is
possible
i
do
get
a
very
nice
berry
taste
to
this
it
kinda
tastes
like
champagne
i
mean
frankly
it
almost
has
characteristics
of
a
hefeweisen
there
is
a
nice
sour
maybe
even
bitter
after
taste
to
this
beer
as
well
i
mean
yeah
it
an
adjunct
lager
and
yeah
its
not
the
greatest
taste
ever
but
its
actually
not
bad
at
all
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
this
is
the
best
ive
had
so
far
accept
for
maybe
pbr
the
mouthfeel
isnt
too
great
but
thats
ok
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
only
because
its
light
but
because
its
tasty
too
overall
an
ok
beer
but
in
terms
of
adjunct
lagers
pretty
dang
good
i
have
always
subscribed
to
the
respect
beer
theory
but
this
one
makes
it
hard
i
can
respect
craft
brewers
who
put
work
into
their
beers
but
this
isnt
that
this
is
mildly
alcoholic
water
with
the
single
purpose
of
being
drank
with
a
funnel
and
hose
overall
this
is
a
great
goto
beer
especially
considering
the
price
under
20
for
a
30
rack
2
for
a
40oz
and
a
solid
enjoyable
drink
every
time
i
dont
only
go
to
high
life
because
its
cheap
though
i
really
do
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
solid
everyday
drinkable
beer
will
enjoy
high
life
and
chances
are
they
probably
already
do
617
before
i
got
into
different
types
of
beer
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
drank
pours
golden
as
you
can
see
through
the
clear
bottle
white
froth
head
fairly
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
much
to
taste
i
guess
sometimes
you
could
taste
an
apple
sorta
taste
but
not
much
taste
wise
just
tastes
like
generic
beer
to
me
something
if
i
was
to
drink
a
lot
ill
get
this
very
drinkable
its
not
bad
at
all
overall
tried
to
be
objective
here
but
there
just
isnt
much
to
this
beer
just
sweet
and
bubbly
i
actually
would
probably
buy
this
again
that
score
is
on
the
upper
side
of
average
miller
highlife
always
seems
to
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
i
do
love
all
types
and
styles
of
beer
craft
and
mass
produced
highlife
is
a
beer
i
go
for
time
and
time
again
on
common
days
it
is
very
easy
drinking
i
must
say
i
agree
with
what
i
remember
an
uncle
saying
long
ago
when
i
was
just
a
young
college
student
he
said
miller
highlife
is
probably
the
most
beautiful
looking
beers
of
its
type
i
still
agree
i
catch
myself
gazing
at
its
golden
color
and
slow
moving
little
bubbles
dancing
around
while
i
sip
it
in
the
florida
sunlight
this
beer
has
a
nice
crisp
start
and
a
soft
light
alcohol
finish
i
also
taste
hints
of
sweet
bread
flavors
it
also
has
a
better
lace
on
the
glass
than
most
of
its
competitors
this
is
a
favorite
of
mine
while
out
fishing
or
working
in
the
yard
beautiful
light
beer
american
beer
at
its
finest
as
a
canadian
when
i
go
to
the
states
i
get
this
on
tap
cheap
tasty
refreshing
i
can
drink
12
to
18
of
these
no
rim
scald
no
beagle
breath
no
hang
over
beautiful
the
best
part
is
is
a
6
pack
of
16
ounce
cans
is
about
5
50
d
what
do
i
feel
this
beer
is
its
a
better
version
of
mgd
imo
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
prominent
and
it
is
very
easy
drinking
i
wish
this
was
in
canada
i
would
love
to
enjoy
this
all
evening
or
at
the
pub
great
for
beginner
beer
drinker
but
also
great
for
a
discerning
ba
that
wants
something
cheap
yet
flavorful
d
standard
abv
and
though
not
complex
miller
high
life
does
offer
some
flavor
i
am
on
a
search
for
a
decent
and
cheap
light
beer
i
can
give
to
friends
who
are
not
into
microbrews
and
also
one
that
i
can
drink
myself
i
want
to
place
two
thoughts
into
consideration
lets
compare
macro
brews
with
other
macro
brews
lets
also
consider
that
union
brewed
beer
produces
family
wage
jobs
which
are
more
important
than
ever
today
i
like
to
think
that
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
is
good
for
our
economy
miller
high
life
should
be
considered
a
classic
beer
with
these
considerations
the
head
is
unique
for
macro
brews
the
creamy
mouth
feel
can
seem
luxurious
when
only
a
lighter
beer
will
satisfy
my
dry
the
taste
is
consistently
good
for
this
style
no
matter
how
many
glasses
you
drain
along
with
pbr
it
is
truly
the
working
persons
or
students
best
option
if
you
like
to
have
six
or
more
at
a
time
without
blowing
out
the
budget
and
you
want
something
that
is
refreshing
and
tastes
good
i
am
very
thankful
that
miller
high
life
is
still
available
at
a
reasonably
low
cost
this
is
known
as
the
high
life
for
those
of
us
who
like
to
drink
beer
frequently
within
our
budget
i
envy
anyone
who
can
afford
to
do
this
with
micro
brews
i
am
willing
to
label
miller
high
life
as
the
champagne
of
beer
for
the
common
person
it
deserves
a
lot
of
respect
for
this
reason
in
comparison
with
other
beers
in
its
class
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
lacks
taste
but
still
very
quaffable
this
beer
is
undrinkable
in
every
waybut
im
sure
theres
some
manwoman
out
there
driving
down
the
road
singing
along
to
acdc
waving
their
welfare
check
out
the
window
that
cant
wait
to
get
some
on
the
bright
side
this
beer
is
inexpensive
d
very
drinkable
this
is
my
party
beer
cheap
enough
to
buy
in
bulk
and
drinkable
enough
to
go
all
night
drinkability
i
could
see
this
as
a
goto
for
cheap
beer
certainly
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
this
will
become
one
of
my
fall
back
beers
besides
pbr
refreshing
crisp
and
dirt
cheap
sounds
like
a
plan
to
me
probably
one
of
the
best
bets
if
you
absolutely
have
to
pick
a
beer
from
the
big
three
pouring
gives
you
about
one
finger
of
head
which
sticks
around
for
a
fair
amount
of
time
smells
dry
and
a
little
musty
theres
some
sweetness
in
there
also
high
lifes
flavor
is
dry
and
a
slightly
bitter
i
taste
corn
and
something
leafy
this
isnt
the
first
beer
id
grab
from
the
mbc
section
but
itll
do
in
a
pinch
d
this
is
my
favorite
party
beer
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
and
do
d
very
easy
to
drink
as
the
taste
is
mild
and
unoffensive
this
is
the
perfect
cheap
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
good
for
a
sports
game
party
or
after
working
outside
it
can
only
be
enjoyed
if
it
ice
cold
truly
the
champagne
of
discount
beers
passing
grade
for
the
high
life
d
actually
quite
refreshing
in
a
shitty
way
serving
type
bottle
i
remember
drinking
it
twenty
years
ago
it
was
a
better
beer
not
the
same
recipe
as
they
cheapened
it
to
put
it
in
a
lower
price
category
d
you
can
drink
this
all
night
it
has
no
heaviness
to
it
so
you
can
keep
pulling
them
back
might
cause
some
gastronomical
distress
had
this
in
many
different
cities
across
this
great
land
and
its
too
bad
this
was
my
beer
of
choice
when
i
was
a
young
lad
not
at
all
what
i
would
consider
to
be
a
choice
for
drinking
now
i
would
much
rather
have
water
and
wont
even
offer
to
my
friends
i
rated
this
high
in
drinkability
because
i
think
you
can
drink
your
own
weight
of
this
stuff
d
these
go
down
so
easily
its
hard
to
describe
very
suprising
i
would
go
to
this
any
day
before
a
bud
or
coors
i
have
to
be
honest
i
am
pleasently
suprised
d
easily
drinkable
a
nice
change
of
pace
over
other
party
beers
this
is
a
good
beer
to
wash
down
a
nice
sandwich
or
barbecue
even
if
it
takes
two
although
i
think
for
those
with
really
refined
tastes
they
would
find
the
experience
to
be
pretty
mediocre
at
best
not
bat
not
great
for
me
its
a
good
beer
plain
and
simple
and
for
the
price
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
verdict
a
decent
adjunct
lager
an
affordable
lager
this
would
make
a
decent
party
beer
for
those
who
are
looking
for
quantity
over
quality
it
has
its
flaws
but
they
are
slightly
less
evident
than
the
horde
of
other
american
adjunct
lagers
this
beer
has
given
me
more
reasons
to
review
macros
it
wasnt
terrible
c
2
8
overall
great
beer
when
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
i
wouldnt
order
it
at
a
bar
but
its
nice
to
have
a
few
in
the
fridge
when
feel
like
having
a
decent
macro
in
short
beer
thats
fresh
tastes
better
macro
brews
get
trucked
all
over
the
place
and
even
with
multiple
breweries
most
of
the
big
guys
dont
want
to
admit
having
a
hard
time
keeping
their
product
fresh
bornon
dates
dont
reflect
weeks
in
a
110
degree
warehouse
or
stockroom
super
clear
and
fizzy
this
looks
a
bit
darker
than
normal
urine
not
a
totally
gross
looking
beer
nice
foamy
head
smells
of
adjuncts
mostly
corn
no
hops
noticeable
taste
is
the
same
a
little
sour
feels
thin
and
watery
of
course
a
little
worse
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
mostly
just
meh
one
of
the
best
of
the
adjunct
lagers
one
of
the
only
beers
that
can
be
served
in
a
glass
bottle
after
sitting
in
sun
for
a
week
and
then
thrown
in
the
freezer
without
any
skunkiness
at
all
goes
down
easy
when
very
cold
hard
to
drink
enough
of
these
to
even
get
a
buzz
due
to
the
sheer
volume
of
liquid
at
least
it
doesnt
taste
like
puke
like
most
of
the
adjuncts
its
merely
a
weak
beer
without
many
defining
characteristics
other
than
having
alcohol
and
the
approximate
color
and
nature
of
beer
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
much
body
could
put
down
a
lot
of
these
in
a
night
and
i
think
thats
how
most
people
drink
it
big
thick
head
of
two
plus
fingers
very
clingy
lace
color
is
a
2
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
lighter
than
some
light
beers
but
with
more
kick
smell
is
corn
and
corn
stalk
taste
is
corn
and
cereal
grain
and
malt
sort
of
crisp
as
long
as
it
is
cold
most
beers
start
to
taste
better
as
the
warm
not
this
one
not
heavy
in
mouthfeel
there
but
not
much
this
is
a
hot
day
beer
yard
work
good
beer
to
drink
while
washing
your
car
i
picked
up
a
four
pack
at
a
gas
station
half
and
hour
before
new
years
this
seemed
to
be
the
least
nasty
of
what
was
offered
i
have
seen
others
comparing
the
appearance
to
urine
that
is
a
lie
drinking
urine
would
be
an
improvement
pours
an
incredibly
foamy
white
head
the
stench
emanating
is
reminiscent
of
unscented
laundry
detergent
rotting
vegetable
matter
and
metal
has
a
bitter
sensation
unlike
a
good
ipa
imagine
consuming
arsenic
or
rat
poison
same
idea
oily
sudzy
metallic
non
edible
are
ways
to
describe
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
up
there
with
battery
acid
your
body
will
know
this
is
not
something
to
be
consumed
in
any
quantity
and
respond
with
near
instant
objections
well
all
of
that
said
it
drinks
better
than
all
else
but
still
a
little
weak
nothing
in
the
appearance
pleasant
smell
good
slightly
hoppy
taste
but
alas
the
drinkability
of
mhl
is
its
only
redeming
quality
it
goes
down
easy
and
does
what
alcohol
does
best
it
sits
just
about
the
same
place
that
most
macro
brews
sit
in
the
grand
scheme
of
beer
this
is
more
acceptable
than
most
other
choicesit
carries
a
decent
head
and
a
better
than
average
smell
for
an
adjunct
taste
can
vary
from
acceptable
to
awful
depending
on
how
cold
it
is
feel
is
thin
and
carbonated
just
like
one
would
expect
if
they
are
cold
enough
i
can
knock
a
few
of
these
back
its
my
ideal
choice
for
beer
pong
cheap
enough
and
not
as
awful
as
the
alternatives
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
both
clean
and
mildly
flavored
not
much
is
going
to
stop
you
from
putting
a
few
of
these
down
if
thats
what
you
want
to
do
there
could
be
some
better
flavors
to
lure
you
in
and
there
are
cleaner
less
floral
adjunct
lagers
out
there
but
high
life
does
a
pretty
good
job
45
value
wise
at
2
85
a
four
pack
of
tallboys
this
stuff
is
excellent
when
youre
looking
for
a
cheep
beer
to
satisfy
the
masses
so
they
dont
drink
all
your
expensive
craft
beers
ive
never
gotten
a
hangover
from
this
stuff
i
believe
hangovers
mostly
occur
from
not
having
much
liquid
or
food
in
your
system
because
i
know
i
cant
drink
much
if
i
havent
eaten
dan
okay
amount
of
flavor
a
bit
watery
for
a
lager
cant
believe
this
was
millers
flagship
brand
for
all
these
years
i
think
they
changed
the
recipe
after
repositioning
it
as
a
value
brew
simply
awful
ive
found
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
macro
pale
lager
nothing
really
special
going
on
here
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
nothing
really
bad
about
it
but
nothing
great
though
leaves
little
after
taste
has
a
slight
corny
taste
it
is
a
pale
yellow
with
a
touch
of
orange
it
is
quite
bubbly
and
pleasant
on
the
tongue
id
pick
this
one
over
most
other
pale
lagers
drinkability
ive
had
tons
of
high
life
in
my
day
and
i
do
not
remember
it
ever
being
this
bad
i
guess
thats
why
we
go
back
and
review
these
things
though
right
now
i
know
never
to
buy
this
again
d
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
in
my
opinion
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
though
only
if
it
was
the
only
thing
available
it
doesnt
offer
anything
special
to
drinkers
but
if
your
looking
for
a
good
cheap
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
choices
right
up
there
with
pbr
pours
a
golden
color
has
a
nice
fourfinger
white
head
high
level
of
carbonation
i
actually
find
it
a
pretty
beer
looks
appealing
to
me
aroma
is
mostly
corn
has
that
adjunct
smell
to
it
taste
is
corny
too
a
bit
sweet
basically
no
hops
has
a
slight
grainygrassy
aftertaste
i
find
common
in
adjunct
lagers
however
it
is
still
better
than
others
since
i
didnt
notice
any
skunkiness
or
really
unpleasant
flavors
to
it
for
what
it
is
high
life
is
a
decent
lager
nothing
special
but
still
highly
drinkable
i
bought
a
sixpack
for
casual
beer
drinkers
ended
up
trying
some
for
myself
its
also
quite
cheap
and
i
would
much
rather
buy
this
over
a
more
expensive
foreign
beer
that
i
like
less
corona
heineken
becks
etc
i
highly
recommend
the
high
life
back
in
the
high
life
again
prefer
this
to
pbr
simply
because
of
mouthfeel
but
thats
not
saying
much
what
a
terrible
color
miller
made
this
beer
though
in
reality
its
much
better
than
it
looks
usually
im
not
going
to
say
much
in
the
favor
of
a
bmc
beer
however
this
isnt
so
bad
this
beer
tastes
like
slighy
grains
a
very
bland
hint
of
hop
and
water
however
all
these
flavors
are
much
more
dominant
in
mhl
then
they
are
in
any
of
the
other
macro
lagers
that
i
can
by
a
sixer
for
under
5
dollars
it
looks
like
a
beer
smells
like
a
beer
and
tastes
like
a
beer
no
need
to
over
analyze
this
one
great
stuff
when
its
hot
outside
or
when
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
cold
beer
without
having
to
think
very
much
not
good
with
food
other
than
dogs
just
my
opinion
though
dm
very
crisp
and
tingly
beer
because
of
the
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
which
makes
this
the
perfect
summer
grilling
beer
refreshing
and
surprising
flavor
considering
that
this
is
something
from
a
mass
brewer
sort
of
plain
but
really
better
than
i
expected
nothing
particularly
interesting
about
it
but
nothing
to
truly
hate
unless
you
dont
like
corn
or
youre
looking
for
flavor
d
goes
down
easy
especially
when
served
ice
cold
hey
its
100
degrees
out
and
ive
got
a
few
bucks
in
my
pocket
i
know
what
im
getting
its
refreshing
in
all
ways
and
inoffensive
so
there
and
has
one
of
the
greatest
logos
around
seeking
distinct
character
look
elsewhere
look
here
because
its
the
best
example
of
what
it
is
aal
done
of
the
most
drinakble
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
i
got
this
at
2
for
1s
at
applebees
and
i
swallowed
both
mugs
like
it
were
water
it
stays
smooth
and
crisp
d
very
easy
to
down
which
i
suppose
is
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
its
a
fairly
typical
adjunct
but
better
than
all
the
lite
crap
pours
a
pure
white
threefinger
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaving
some
lace
lightmedium
carbonation
and
light
bodied
crystal
clear
pale

color
nose
is
flavor
is
sweet
corn
with
faint
hints
of
hops
in
background
squeaky
clean
finish
good
lawn

better
than
mgd
the
champagne
of
beers
who
are
they
kidding
1
25
for
a
12oz
bottle
from

acton
ma
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
decent
enough
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
sweet
corn
and
some
florals
tastes
semisweet
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
playing
with
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
needs
major
work
good
carbonation
poor
drinkability
d
cant
really
say
anything
here
other
than
i
would
take
it
over
any
light
beer
from
bmc
probably
one
of
the
better
macros
this
is
really
as
light
of
a
beer
as
i
can
go
but
it
really
is
one
of
lifes
simple
pleasures
to
crack
open
a
high
life
that
was
kept
on
ice
while
you
mow
the
lawn
miller
time
anyone
clear
and
yellowgold
in
color
large
fizzy
head
that
quickly
shrunk
to
a
few
bubbles
looks
like
a
stereotypical
american
beer
smell
is
pretty
unappealing
corn
husk
musty
grain
and
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
very
mild
little
to
no
hop
flavor
and
the
malts
are
a
little
sweet
basically
par
for
the
course
mouthfeel
is
fluid
and
crisp
from
the
full
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
pale
lager
i
dont
feel
like
seeking
this
beer
out
in
the
future
but
who
am
i
kidding
although
this
beer
is
made
by
miller
which
represents
the
american
beer
powerhouses
miller
coors
bud
of
which
i
do
not
like
at
al
this
beer
actually
isnt
too
bad
for
a
mainstream
american
light
lager
it
has
a
light
body
with
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
it
isnt
my
first
choice
but
miller
high
life
actually
isnt
that
bad
and
its
about
the
same
price
as
natural
light
which
i
will
never
again
drink
plus
high
life
has
a
great
slogan
the
champagne
of
beers
its
a
cheap
beer
so
you
cant
expect
a
lot
its
probably
better
than
other
macros
but
not
by
too
far
honestly
id
hoped
for
more
sure
there
is
nothing
impressive
about
it
but
you
can
always
find
this
beer
and
know
exactly
what
to
expect
i
prefer
the
taste
of
this
beer
to
the
bud
lights
miller
and
coors
beers
it
is
a
highly
carbonated
beer
but
the
taste
is
a
love
and
hate
relationship
i
think
the
taste
is
more
complex
than
your
typical
lagerpilsner
but
for
the
price
and
history
with
this
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
this
up
for
an
all
day
drink
secession
d
goes
down
smooth
and
is
extremely
affordable
not
bad
for
a
macro
mhl
is
such
a
huge
improvement
over
tecate
and
likely
much
better
than
pbr
and
probably
every
macro
aaj
a
simple
complement
to
battered
fish
that
has
its
place
keeps
its
price
and
knows
its
role
the
gentlemans
choice
overall
its
better
than
some
cheap
american
lagers
but
not
near
as
good
as
pbr
d
i
mean
for
a
light
bodied
beer
that
has
more
taste
than
youd
expect
this
is
pretty
downable
had
one
with
a
chicken
sandwich
i
got
tired
of
smelling
aluminum
when
i
drink
cheap
beer
so
i
began
pouring
it
into
my
20
oz
ikea
glass
tried
rainier
first
but
it
seemed
to
leave
a
headache
so
i
paid
about
70
cents
more
for
a
six
pack
of
16
oz
cans
and
poured
away
i
was
impressed
by
the
persistent
head
and
began
to
drink
i
found
it
rather
soft
and
vaugely
sweet
although
you
can
detect
hops
and
barley
there
it
is
appropriately
yellow
so
unless
they
used
food
coloring
it
must
be
real
beer
the
taste
was
smooth
and
the
aftertaste
was
somewhere
between
acceptable
and
undetectable
active
ingredient
being
5
the
buzz
from
16
oz
is
just
about
right
for
a
quiet
sunny
day
out
in
the
yard
you
could
probably
drink
this
all
day
and
then
run
out
in
your
front
yard
naked
waving
a
shotgun
and
still
wake
up
the
next
day
feeling
fine
and
ready
for
another
session
next
time
i
am
feeling
flush
with
cash
i
will
try
budweiser
which
is
about
2
more
than
rainier
for
16oz
6packs
its
so
cheap
7
and
change
for
a
12pack
of
bottles
for
like
0
64
cents
a
bottle
ill
take
it
however
nothing
about
this
beer
is
good
except
for
the
price
i
cant
recall
any
smell
at
all
which
could
be
a
good
thing
it
tastes
decent
though
and
it
goes
down
fairly
well
frothy
head
upon
initial
pouring
there
is
a
faint
smell
that
reminded
me
of
dish
water
or
cleaning
bleach
but
it
disappeared
quickly
and
had
no
effect
on
the
taste
the
flavor
is
ok
for
a
budget
macro
brew
i
found
the
mouth
feel
to
be
somewhat
on
the
lighter
side
a
decent
summer
time
lager
when
the
budget
is
tight
or
you
need
to
pass
a
kidney
stone
best
thing
about
mhl
i
found
was
the
feel
and
drinkability
no
bite
and
limited
fizz
drinks
somewhat
smooth
but
not
as
crisp
or
wateryclean
as
other
massmarketed
brands
and
thats
a
big
plus
content
to
have
this
again
if
its
laying
around
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
its
really
affordable
so
thats
also
a
plus
four
16ounce
cans
cost
me
a
bit
over
2
better
than
the
average
american
adjunct
lager
the
next
day
i
had
a
headache
lots
of
rice
and
or
corn
in
this
bad
boy
in
fact
it
is
a
step
down
in
quality
from
the
coors
light
i
had
yesterday
id
reach
for
a
coors
light
one
hundred
times
out
of
one
hundred
if
forced
to
choose
between
it
and
miller
high
life
this
sucks
in
a
hot
summer
blaze
one
could
easily
drink
a
case
of
mhl
its
not
bad
overall
i
never
pour
these
out
of
the
bottle
to
drink
mainly
because
one
of
the
reasons
i
purchase
it
is
because
i
like
the
bottle
its
a
great
beer
for
drinking
on
a
budget
or
when
hanging
out
with
non
craft
drinking
friends
very
drinkable
as
i
said
i
had
three
and
could
easily
have
had
more
if
i
were
not
driving
its
funny
that
i
can
remember
that
this
beer
was
derided
about
10
or
15
years
agoit
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
available
now
i
think
its
probably
about
one
of
the
best
of
the
big
brewery
beers
out
there
there
is
only
one
macro
that
i
enjoy
drinking
and
this
one
is
it
there
are
others
that
i
can
tolerate
but
this
one
i
will
buy
just
to
have
something
around
that
is
refreshing
to
drink
something
that
is
not
heavy
or
hoppy
or
malty
just
lightweight
and
enjoyable
even
with
the
adjuncts
there
is
nothing
offensive
here
and
it
does
the
job
that
it
is
supposed
to
do
crisp
thin
mouth
feel
excellent
head
and
lacing
down
the
glass
please
dont
drink
from
the
container
pour
this
one
i
like
the
6
pack
of
16oz
cans
best
poured
into
glass
because
i
have
had
some
inconsistent
quality
in
the
bottles
occasionally
yo
get
a
very
bitter
one
for
some
reason
theres
not
much
aroma
to
savor
but
the
balance
in
flavor
and
adequate
alcohol
content
make
this
one
the
best
macro
out
there
that
i
have
found
yet
not
to
mention
the
price
is
great
drinkability
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
since
you
dont
really
taste
anything
very
little
complexity
dits
cheap
to
drink
so
if
youre
broke
and
looking
to
get
drunk
go
for
this
over
some
others
the
name
might
be
impressive
but
the
beer
is
not
light
low
quality
hay
taste
seems
odd
because
this
beer
should
be
promoting
the
high
life
there
is
pretty
heavy
carbonation
and
it
just
seems
like
a
miller
bottled
with
a
high
life
special
tag
nothing
to
get
excited
over
goes
down
very
easy
when
u
r
in
the
mood
to
drink
but
if
im
notg
really
thirsty
its
hard
to
get
one
down
descent
for
the
price
overall
no
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
was
98
degrees
on
the
pier
and
it
did
its
job
i
have
had
far
worse
then
this
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
but
it
has
its
place
mainly
a
100
degree
day
or
a
ballgame
thats
pretty
much
it
a
bright
golden
hue
plenty
of
carbonation
sometimes
a
little
too
much
simple
beer
aroma
plain
taste
maybe
a
bit
sweet
the
carbonation
makes
this
a
smooth
drink
a
good
alternative
when
im
in
a
mood
where
im
not
much
interested
in
the
taste
of
my
beer
d
average
d
its
a
lawnmower
beer
as
adjunct
lagers
go
its
average
and
i
find
adjunct
lagers
highly
drinkable
at
proper
serving
temperatures
i
picked
up
this
40
only
because
it
was
2
dollars
and
i
was
broke
i
accompanied
this
40
with
another
40
of
genesee
which
i
believe
was
a
little
better
i
will
prolly
never
intentially
seek
this
out
again
but
im
sure
we
will
run
into
each
other
sooner
or
later
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
surprising
which
unfortunately
quickly
dissipated
not
a
lot
of
smell
to
it
but
i
can
sniff
a
little
bit
of
hops
it
has
a
clean
taste
of
grain
and
corn
feels
mike
a
mediumlight
body
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
i
only
had
this
at
a
party
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
have
found
that
in
general
when
things
come
out
of
camouflaged
can
they
dont
taste
super
great
although
i
am
sure
i
could
this
isnt
something
i
would
like
to
spend
my
evening
drinking
verdict
miller
high
life
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
perpetually
weak
style
out
there
please
excuse
the
backhanded
compliment
if
i
had
to
pick
one
american
adjunct
lager
out
of
a
cooler
at
a
party
i
think
this
would
be
it
the
beer
is
an
average
example
of
its
style
clean
clear
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
had
ok
retention
and
even
a
bit
of
lacing
a
slightly
sweet
but
mostly
neutral
aroma
and
taste
crisp
clean
smooth
and
balanced
body
good
drinkability
for
the
style
for
a
cheap
american
lager
this
is
better
than
some
not
as
good
as
others
pours
a
light
see
through
yellow
with
a
2
finger
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
and
very
carbonated
almost
burns
a
little
bit
after
the
first
sip
basic
macro
style
lager
taste
taste
like
bud
light
and
coors
it
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
not
a
beer
you
sit
and
enjoy
life
the
wind
whispers
as
the
man
finally
immerses
his
entire
being
both
physically
and
spiritually
into
the
sparkling
pool
once
suspended
face
merely
grazing
the
surface
the
man
now
enters
the
realm
of
cheapandrefreshing
d
for
being
so
fricking
cheap
it
is
pretty
frickin
decent
i
have
bought
this
stuff
for
a
while
and
it
passes
for
beer
in
my
book
d
well
i
have
lost
the
taste
for
this
beer
and
would
not
want
another
one
to
have
the
same
bland
taste
while
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
nonfilling
thats
what
they
wanted
i
would
say
lower
end
of
drinkability
for
the
lack
of
desire
to
return
for
more
drinking
in
regards
to
tasteflavor
and
aroma
the
best
thing
we
got
going
on
here
is
the
carbonation
the
bubbles
abound
this
literally
is
champagne
like
in
its
carbonation
pours
very
light
and
clear
golden
yellow
big
white
head
soon
turns
into
a
sudsy
yet
sticky
ring
smells
like
a
hay
field
that
was
cut
three
days
ago
taste
is
clean
and
light
biscuity
a
hint
of
leafy
bitters
on
the
end
adds
to
this
beer
being
a
step
above
the
average
adjunct
drinkability
is
not
that
high
imo
too
sticky
of
a
finish
for
increased
consumption
d
for
an
adjunct
this
is
a
decent
beer
also
their
commercials
are
humorous
pabst
has
more
hops
presence
and
mgd
has
more
malt
miller
high
life
is
just
about
in
the
middle
of
these
two
making
it
easier
to
drink
more
than
one
and
cooling
off
the
day
d
id
put
it
up
there
with
pbr
as
best
of
the
worst
for
what
it
is
not
too
shabby
pours
golden
and
pure
decent
white
head
retention
is
ok
nose
is
clean
grainy
and
corn
husky
taste
is
much
the
same
fresh
grain
almost
nonexistent
hops
thus
no
bitterness
cooked
corn
is
quite
prominent
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
quite
smooth
actually
malt
vs
crispness
balances
quite
well
for
an
aal
overall
this
beer
lacks
depth
and
complexity
but
what
it
lacks
in
depth
and
complexity
it
makes
up
for
in
refreshing
crispness
nothing
really
off
flavor
or
out
of
bounds
decent
well
rounded
simple
for
46pack
you
simply
can
not
beat
it
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
chlorinated
corn
absolutely
awful
the
flavor
is
corn
with
some
grassy
notes
luckily
the
chlorine
from
the
aroma
is
not
that
apparent
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
drinkability
high
life
is
light
enough
to
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
but
heavy
enough
to
be
satisfying
it
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
budget
macro
brews
d
pretty
good
drinkability
but
could
lead
to
a
bad
hangover
becuse
of
the
water
quality
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
enjoy
on
those
hot
summer
evenings
as
you
are
sitting
on
your
porchbalcony
watching
the
lightning
from
a
distance
while
eating
a
hearty
tomato
based
bbq
sandwich
it
smells
like
most
cheap
beers
a
hint
of
alcohol
mostly
corn
grain
and
a
little
metallic
the
taste
is
similar
corn
and
metal
not
really
any
hops
or
malt
theyre
there
but
you
cant
taste
them
feels
like
bubbly
carbonation
and
drinks
well
d
one
of
those
beers
that
nails
the
style
guidelines
but
gets
a
regular
beatdown
by
beer
advocates
that
grace
these
pages
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
cheap
beers
d
very
good
its
nothing
to
unsettling
with
taste
or
alcoholic
content
but
id
have
a
few
on
tap
for
affordability
and
the
overall
appeal
of
a
beer
of
this
caliber
cheap
and
effective
its
not
as
bad
as
you
think
it
is
when
i
want
a
cheap
drinkable
single
serving
can
of
beer
this
is
what
i
drink
sure
i
could
purchase
40s
but
then
i
would
have
to
completely
change
my
lifestyle
in
all
seriousness
this
beer
is
macro
style
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
the
others
one
of
the
positives
of
this
brew
is
that
it
does
leave
a
very
nice
lacing
on
my
glass
which
i
was
surprised
at
the
color
is
light
golden
with
a
heavy
co2
characteristic
to
it
flavor
well
is
sour
with
a
mish
mash
of
corn
grains
hops
unlike
most
beers
where
you
can
separate
the
hop
flavor
from
the
malt
flavor
and
enjoy
both
this
beer
presents
all
flavors
at
once
overall
a
nice
macro
treat
on
draft
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
while
cheap
may
actually
offer
more
than
some
of
its
more
expensive
relatives
e
g
miller
lite
while
the
corn
is
very
prevalent
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
consume
and
is
quite
refreshing
the
bottle
if
nothing
else
is
a
piece
of
nostalgic
history
that
echoes
the
glory
days
of
the
american
lager
even
when
consumed
warm
there
are
no
off
flavors
and
the
carbonation
stays
under
control
if
you
like
miller
lite
but
want
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
give
this
beer
a
try
good
drinkability
crisp
and
refreshing
good
solid
brew
d
went
ahead
and
bought
a
12pack
of
these
because
they
were
so
cheap
great
price
for
this
beer
expected
it
to
be
bad
because
the
price
was
so
good
but
its
one
ill
have
again
sometimes
these
are
cool
to
drink
for
kitsche
value
my
tour
of
duty
in
milwaukeemarquette
made
drinking
these
kind
of
obligatory
for
awhile
theres
definitely
worse
aals
out
there
corn
city
drinkability
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
so
wonderful
to
be
living
the
high
life
again
after
a
long
absence
pale
golden
color
with
a
billowing
white
head
smells
somewhat
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
graininess
and
absolutely
no
hops
tastes
similar
to
how
it
smells
a
little
sweetness
and
not
much
more
cold
crisp
and
carbonated
perfectly
fits
the
bill
it
was
designed
for
refreshing
and
not
at
all
unpleasant
in
the
right
situation
feeldrink
really
refreshing
when
you
just
want
a
beer
highly
carbonated
and
mild
bodied
drinkability
actually
pretty
damn
good
for
an
adjunct
lager
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
slam
down
a
few
crappy
version
of
miller
lite
which
is
pretty
crappy
itself
overall
not
something
i
would
buy
however
at
the
same
time
i
cant
say
much
thats
bad
about
it
for
its
category
and
thats
why
i
hate
it
its
just
so
boring
and
downthemiddle
there
are
no
exciting
flavors
here
nothing
differentiates
it
from
any
other
beer
no
character
because
of
that
sour
malt
quality
and
overall
lack
of
nuance
to
the
beer
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
the
list
of
one
of
my
favorites
however
it
is
still
somewhat
decent
drinkability
nothing
special
at
all
good
for
a
quick
refresher
or
to
get
drunk
other
than
that
should
be
avoided
but
i
doubt
anyone
here
needed
me
to
tell
them
that
drinkability
the
champagne
of
beers
please
the
only
connection
this
beer
has
to
champagne
is
color
and
carbonation
level
this
is
a
good
beer
for
quick
repeated
consumption
nothing
else
its
slightly
better
out
of
a
bottle
overall
high
life
is
nothing
more
than
a
more
carbonated
version
of
mgd
smell
and
flavor
are
corn
corn
and
corn
the
foam
for
whatever
reason
is
highly
bitter
but
theres
no
bitter
in
the
beer
itself
a
little
bit
of
malty
aftertaste
does
stick
around
for
a
while
and
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
nice
as
for
drinkability
i
finished
about
half
a
bottle
while
writing
this
review
no
bitterness
and
low
alcohol
content
means
thisll
do
just
fine
for
your
next
beer
pong
party
and
thats
living
the
high
life
typical
adjunct
lager
that
leaves
me
feeling
meh
hot
day
or
at
a
party
like
i
had
this
beer
is
perfect
otherwise
skip
it
and
go
for
something
better
overall
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
but
not
that
you
want
to
d
like
water
corny
fizzy
water
drinkability
is
above
average
for
the
same
reason
pat
on
the
back
for
miller
d
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
turn
to
if
the
price
wasnt
so
cheap
in
winter
months
this
beer
isnt
the
greatest
either
when
you
would
want
something
heavier
but
during
the
summertime
or
when
cash
is
tight
this
is
a
beer
to
go
with
however
i
still
feel
its
beer
than
most
other
macro
lagers
out
there
d
this
beer
is
very
clean
but
could
be
a
bit
more
crisp
with
a
little
hint
of
hops
or
malt
to
add
character
d
manufactured
to
finish
with
no
aftertaste
that
helps
the
drinkablility
this
is
not
an
absolutely
gross
beer
like
many
of
its
sisters
and
competitors
as
far
as
being
the
champagne
of
beers
they
have
never
heard
of
deus
poured
into
a
red
16oz
solo
plastic
cup
at
the
local
catholic
church
shindig
it
was
supercold
so
there
was
no
vapor
so
i
cant
comment
on
the
smell
it
had
a
head
it
was
a
very
basic
yellow
color
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
its
rep
as
the
champagne
of
bottled
beers
but
it
brought
back
reassuring
memories
of
early
adulthood
so
im
not
gonna
give
it
a
bad
review
my
only
regret
was
that
it
was
not
in
a
quart
bottle
with
a
screwon
cap
notes
not
bad
for
what
it
is
suppose
to
be
not
too
different
from
other
macros
probably
as
good
or
better
than
most
macros
cheers
rjt
thinbodied
with
aggressive
but
not
harsh
carbonation
smooth
and
grainy
mouthfeel
ive
already
reviewed
the
bottled
version
of
this
beer
while
the
canned
version
is
more
or
less
the
same
it
does
take
on
a
bit
of
a
steely
metallic
taste
this
is
somewhat
mitigated
by
pouring
it
into
a
glass
still
a
decent
brew
but
if
you
have
the
choice
between
bottled
or
canned
id
definitely
go
with
the
former
this
beer
is
rather
bitter
and
nothing
special
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
american
macro
lagers
i
have
tried
i
really
think
they
could
up
the
ante
on
such
a
hyped
up
beer
the
carbonation
is
super
low
and
its
not
one
bit
crisp
on
the
tongue
either
all
i
taste
is
stagnant
fizzy
water
that
seemed
to
have
been
passed
through
a
bag
of
metallic
minerals
drinkability
horrible
its
too
flavorful
to
be
a
chugging
beer
and
to
shitty
to
drink
for
the
purpose
of
appreciating
beer
the
sickly
sweetness
of
the
corn
and
barley
intermingling
with
a
brief
hop
bitterness
the
metallic
finish
the
striking
awareness
of
what
it
means
to
be
an
american
realizing
that
this
beer
is
brewed
in
kettles
bigger
than
anything
you
will
ever
own
that
slight
touch
of
something
it
cant
be
hops
only
miller
lite
is
triple
hopped
at
the
end
that
signifies
something
meaningful
yet
esoteric
such
is
the
way
of
the
american
dream
long
live
this
beautiful
land
as
for
the
people
as
long
as
they
are
cold
these
go
down
easy
something
light
and
cheap
with
a
bit
of
taste
high
carbonation
on
par
with
the
other
usual
suspects
i
give
this
bonus
points
for
having
such
an
attractive
bottle
design
timeless
the
champagne
of
beers
indeed
the
tap
version
of
this
was
by
and
far
the
best
of
all
of
the
mediums
of
drinking
there
was
a
slight
hint
of
what
might
be
called
hops
and
the
head
seemed
to
be
a
bit
better
off
other
than
that
the
whole
thing
was
still
generic
and
a
poor
choice
for
a
beer
poured
out
of
a
shiny
gold
24oz
can
the
beer
was
gold
but
rather
pale
in
comparison
fluffy
white
head
left
a
surprising
amount
of
lacing
the
champagne
of
beers
is
really
not
too
bad
for
the
style
theres
a
wet
grass
that
accompanies
the
adjunct
sweetness
the
grassy
scent
seems
to
show
itself
slightly
in
the
taste
theres
also
a
very
slight
hint
of
wheat
i
have
to
admit
that
this
would
be
my
macro
of
choice
at
the
current
time
looking
for
a
micro
brew
or
craft
brew
dont
bother
with
this
one
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
the
fiscally
challenged
another
staple
in
american
beer
the
champagne
of
beer
cheap
but
good
not
great
but
still
just
good
a
beer
that
does
have
its
place
but
isnt
the
first
pick
of
the
ice
chest
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
light
and
has
low
flavor
which
helps
along
with
its
easy
drinking
good
with
almost
any
barbecue
outdoor
picnic
at
the
bar
or
around
a
fire
a
good
beer
drank
a
lot
of
this
back
in
the
day
as
it
was
a
big
favorite
of
my
brother
i
never
could
get
into
it
always
had
a
real
syrupy
mouthfeel
for
a
pale
lager
which
defeated
a
lot
of
the
refreshment
purpose
of
these
types
of
beers
flavor
was
very
standard
for
the
style
gimme
a
pbr
over
this
any
day
drinkability
not
the
greatest
for
binge
drinking
but
still
very
good
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
good
tasting
either
this
beer
is
based
on
the
style
it
is
classified
in
nothing
special
but
its
a
good
beer
for
a
night
out
with
the
guys
not
so
sure
its
the
champagne
of
beers
but
for
my
money
id
buy
it
again
has
a
musky
taste
to
it
that
isnt
overpowering
you
can
definately
suck
down
quite
a
few
of
these
the
ones
i
had
were
in
tallboy
cans
cant
get
any
better
than
that
ive
had
this
beer
maybe
a
million
times
by
now
i
know
it
isnt
a
great
beer
geek
beer
but
its
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
will
satisfy
the
wallet
over
a
long
drinking
beer
night
it
actually
doesnt
taste
that
bad
but
i
do
prefer
the
bottles
over
the
can
the
thing
is
they
make
the
high
life
gear
stuff
so
damn
attractable
i
found
myself
buying
30pack
after
30pack
just
so
i
could
get
a
decent
gift
for
myself
and
i
did
in
the
mail
should
be
coming
a
nice
high
life
grill
apron
but
i
digress
this
beer
is
a
solid
session
beer
that
cant
compare
to
the
great
craft
beers
however
it
does
hold
its
own
and
washes
down
food
quite
nice
poured
from
a
refrigeratortemperature
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
crystal
clear
light
gold
with
a
pure
white
thick
head
quickly
dissipating
into
a
skim
of
lace
tiny
rising
bubbles
live
up
to
its
reputation
as
the
champagne
of
beers
aroma
is
of
light
sweet
malts
unremarkable
yet
inoffensive
flavor
is
of
corn
malts
with
no
hops
to
balance
a
slight
bitterness
up
front
yields
to
a
malty
sweetness
that
does
not
linger
i
cannot
believe
the
abv
there
is
no
real
flavor
of
alcohol
this
is
a
crisp
beer
the
bubbles
are
refreshing
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
as
befits
the
style
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
its
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
has
such
a
mild
flavor
that
it
doesnt
clash
with
edibles
and
the
price
is
right
served
in
a
fridge
temperature
bottle
because
the
best
way
to
experience
the
high
life
is
straight
from
the
bottle
its
a
clear
golden
beer
with
some
carbonation
bubbles
visible
within
in
the
bottle
you
get
no
head
at
all
but
if
someone
is
foolish
enough
to
pour
it
into
a
glass
youll
see
a
thick
pure
white
head
that
will
dissipate
quickly
ive
never
taken
the
time
to
smell
a
high
life
now
i
know
why
lots
of
sweet
malt
and
corn
that
is
rather
offputting
the
flavor
is
also
all
malt
but
cheap
sweet
malts
theres
a
bit
off
the
gross
aftertaste
common
to
this
style
but
not
as
much
as
high
lifes
competitors
considering
the
style
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
hence
the
3
5
rating
its
a
thin
beer
that
is
has
too
much
carbonation
to
really
taste
the
beer
so
maybe
thats
a
good
thing
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
you
dont
want
to
think
about
what
you
are
putting
into
your
body
i
never
drink
it
for
flavor
but
more
for
price
point
and
availability
cheers
have
a
high
life
note
i
recommend
the
bottles
over
the
cans
true
classic
overall
this
makes
a
nice
substitute
for
whenever
my
pockets
are
running
on
e
and
stag
is
nowhere
to
be
found
not
too
bad
all
in
all
of
all
the
yellow
beers
out
there
this
one
is
near
the
top
of
the
pack
sure
that
isnt
saying
much
but
sometimes
you
just
feel
like
a
cheap
lager
and
in
such
a
situation
high
life
isnt
a
very
bad
choice
it
smells
and
tastes
like
almost
every
other
macro
out
there
but
theres
a
certain
something
a
breadlike
taste
that
makes
it
a
bit
more
substantial
than
bud
or
pabst
d
very
easy
drinking
and
a
cheap
former
personal
standby
that
being
said
i
remember
why
i
no
longer
drink
it
pours
very
light
yellow
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
just
another
cheap
lager
tastes
more
adjunct
corn
heavy
than
comparably
priced
canned
beers
it
also
has
a
bit
of
a
harsh
chemical
aftertaste
thats
not
all
that
pleasant
its
not
undrinkable
but
id
stick
with
something
cleaner
tasting
such
as
pbr
or
genny
cream
ale
when
im
looking
for
a
cheap
12pk
of
cans
now
all
that
being
sad
here
in
texas
where
it
is
110
degrees
on
my
patio
when
i
am
grilling
i
need
an
easy
watery
beer
to
quench
my
thirst
while
grilling
very
drinkable
though
not
interesting
but
what
american
lagers
are
overall
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
macrolager
behind
pbr
even
taking
price
out
of
consideration
this
is
still
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
budwesier
as
it
has
much
more
character
and
body
that
said
since
prb
is
regaining
a
lot
of
popularity
and
therefore
going
up
in
price
miller
high
life
is
hard
to
beat
at
6
7912
pack
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
but
than
again
that
was
20
years
ago
and
i
was
still
underage
a
good
inexpensive
easy
to
drink
refreshing
beer
high
life
drinkers
are
a
band
of
brothers
every
time
a
pair
of
high
life
drinkers
cross
paths
at
a
party
there
is
a
high
five
or
a
hand
shake
its
unique
because
its
a
getting
drunk
beer
that
is
filled
with
class
as
well
as
alcohol4
6abv
im
going
to
go
out
and
have
some
more
tomorrow
morning
will
be
painful
my
industrial
pale
lager
of
choice
along
with
pbr
and
asahi
super
dry
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
not
my
beer
of
choice
but
after
working
outside
this
beer
does
quench
a
thirst
high
life
is
what
it
is
unlike
many
american
macros
the
ole
chanpagne
of
beers
has
a
taste
albeit
very
sweet
and
corny
the
smell
is
of
corn
and
the
appearance
of
highly
sedimented
urine
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
refreshing
sodalike
hit
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
first
rate
no
complexity
here
miller
is
my
american
macro
and
in
truth
id
just
as
soon
have
it
as
many
of
the
craft
lagers
i
have
tried
at
two
bucks
a
40
and
when
you
just
want
a
beer
miller
is
first
rate
i
may
however
be
biased
it
was
the
very
first
beer
i
ever
tasted
drinkability
if
your
going
out
to
have
a
few
you
can
drink
these
without
getting
in
too
much
trouble
mhl
is
my
favorite
macro
brew
it
has
a
little
bit
of
a
skunky
smell
to
it
but
i
think
it
adds
to
the
character
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
reasonable
2
finger
head
taste
is
crisp
light
and
refreshing
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
high
great
beer
for
having
a
couple
of
bbq
dogs
or
burgers
on
the
weekend
or
watching
a
ballgame
with
your
friends
goes
good
with
any
mexican
food
that
is
above
the
level
of
taco
bell
overall
obviously
its
not
a
high
end
beer
but
ill
take
it
every
time
over
other
budcoorsmiller
options
you
definitely
cant
beat
the
price
you
can
get
a
12
pack
of
bottles
here
in
nc
for
6
79
this
and
pbr
are
my
go
to
when
i
want
something
cheap
d
miller
drinkablity
and
gets
the
job
done
on
the
most
basic
level
beer
good
this
is
my
old
standby
when
im
short
on
cash
out
of
all
the
beers
on
the
lower
price
tier
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
straight
from
the
bottle
smells
like
corn
and
husk
a
hint
of
wheat
appearance
is
typical
macro
yellow
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
some
corn
and
grain
drinkability
is
high
it
glides
down
the
throat
with
exceptional
ease
if
you
are
short
on
cash
go
for
it
eric
mouthfeel
is
thinmedium
body
with
high
carbonation
drinkability
this
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
it
is
actually
more
drinkable
than
carbonated
water
taste
is
very
watery
and
bland
very
little
to
it
light
and
smooth
and
easy
drinking
is
its
only
redeemable
characteristic
no
bittereness
or
any
trace
of
hops
to
it
ok
for
the
style
but
skip
it
d
its
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
ab
advertises
bud
light
to
be
its
basically
water
the
flavors
are
very
watered
down
but
thats
what
i
expected
bright
golden
yellow
in
color
almost
artificial
looking
hues
huge
plume
of
frothy
head
leaves
quickly
with
no
trace
smell
is
of
light
grass
stale
water
and
bland
corn
taste
is
a
relatively
ineffensive
light
grass
and
corn
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
the
before
mentioned
stale
water
somewhat
bitter
bite
at
the
end
the
body
is
light
ampley
carbonated
and
very
dry
finnish
drinkability
is
low
because
it
always
seems
to
do
something
to
my
stomach
that
i
wont
review
here
the
taste
is
clean
sweet
and
grainy
quite
easy
to
drink
and
quite
easy
to
enjoy
i
told
myself
this
will
go
downhill
as
the
beer
sits
and
beer
warms
it
tasted
the
same
at
the
end
as
at
the
beginning
i
must
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
macro
made
in
america
the
quest
goes
on
but
i
think
i
have
had
most
of
them
drinkability
is
good
in
that
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
with
no
problems
but
not
as
much
as
id
enjoy
drinking
a
few
of
something
else
overall
this
isnt
a
terrible
option
if
youre
looking
for
a
twelve
pack
below
9
but
then
again
you
can
get
yuengling
for
that
price
point
too
still
i
can
confidently
say
that
this
isnt
as
repulsive
as
some
other
beers
in
the
style
beautiful
color
smell
well
it
smells
like
beer
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
the
red
white
and
blue
my
dad
used
to
drink
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
drinkability
you
can
easily
mow
through
610
beers
without
even
realizing
it
i
will
definitly
drink
it
again

pretty
nice
for
an
adjunct
lager
especially
at
the
price
they
sell
it
at
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
it
in
a
can
because
i
dont
get
that
creepy
monster
head
d
a
drinkable
beer
for
sure
but
nothing
special
better
than
many
other
macros
but
you
can
still
do
better
if
youre
on
a
budget
d
when
im
in
a
pinch
or
just
looking
for
something
light
i
usually
go
pbr
but
i
might
start
throwing
this
into
the
rotation
you
cant
compare
it
to
the
greats
or
even
the
mediocre
craft
beers
but
when
put
against
others
in
this
style
it
is
worth
a
shot
t
as
bubbly
as
it
gets
its
not
that
carbonated
in
taste
slight
sourish
aftertaste
it
has
only
limited
taste
really
better
than
many
american
macros
but
still
slightly
below
average
d
this
beer
is
lot
better
than
its
sister
beer
miller
genuine
draft
it
is
due
to
how
they
are
packaged
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
dude
its
miller
high
life
i
must
say
the
bottle
makes
the
difference
its
pretty
terrible
out
of
a
can
i
mean
if
you
want
to
compare
it
to
say
ruination
or
hopslam
it
sucks
but
ill
take
it
over
diesel
any
day
its
my
cheap
beer
of
choice
poured
from
the
40
oz
growler
no
06019b51179
sampled
during
monday
night
football
on
september
14
2009
yep
i
bought
a
bomber
of
the
stuff
already
knowing
what
to
expect
i
was
a
bit
surprised
that
i
had
not
rated
it
yet
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
with
frothy
puffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
your
basic
adjunct
lager
with
a
bit
of
grass
corn
and
faint
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
to
thin
the
taste
opens
with
grain
and
weak
malts
more
so
than
some
of
its
competitors
and
ends
with
a
background
of
hops
for
better
or
for
worse
this
is
the
classic
adjunct
experience
drinkability
of
the
macro
american
adjuct
lagers
its
actually
pretty
good
but
thats
not
saying
all
too
much
easy
to
drink
and
a
bland
but
unoffensive
taste
still
damn
drinkable
good
ole
union
made
champagne
of
beers
but
the
nostalgia
of
a
former
knownothing
isnt
enough
to
make
this
one
to
return
to
esp
in
late
2009
if
youve
got
the
time
weve
got
the
beer
d
a
macro
session
beer
that
i
drink
a
lot
of
when
i
have
nothing
else
to
drink
literally
like
in
certain
parts
of
iowa
and
oklahoma
really
not
a
bad
macro
very
cheap
and
has
a
bad
reputation
but
not
bad
probably
the
best
thing
miller
makes
finish
is
slightly
sweet
with
decent
amount
of
bitterness
cheers
to
life
the
taste
is
pretty
good
it
has
a
hint
of
corn
in
the
taste
and
no
hops
it
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
when
you
are
in
the
mood
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
for
1
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
im
not
complaining
as
far
as
macros
go
this
is
near
the
top
a
wellmade
but
not
particularly
noteworthy
beer
my
favorite
style
of
beers
are
pale
ales
porters
and
belgian
triples
but
im
always
gonna
have
a
place
in
my
belly
for
this
beer
quite
grainy
on
the
nose
though
primarily
of
raw
barley
vs
other
adjuncts
opens
up
to
offer
some
sweet
citric
hop
notes
taking
turns
with
a
vegetal
metallic
nature
sweeter
than
expected
on
the
tongue
and
with
a
lemony
orange
finish
texture
anticipated
from
the
smell
doesnt
materialize
average
feel
but
drink
is
limited
due
to
the
carbonation
reducing
too
quickly
and
what
might
become
a
one
dimensional
sweetness
on
the
finish
d
i
love
high
life
who
doesnt
its
5
99
a
12pack
and
you
know
when
you
pick
some
up
that
you
have
a
devlish
grin
on
your
face
because
in
a
few
hours
you
will
say
something
stupid
and
piss
off
your
wife
the
perfect
dads
beer
drinkability
is
so
so
still
if
i
go
macro
i
want
a
stag
from
a
16
oz
can
pours
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
a
12
inch
head
not
much
aroma
some
hints
of
corn
taste
is
crisp
mild
some
corn
is
present
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
great
for
beer
games
otherwise
very
mediocre
poured
from
a
12
ounce
can
into
a
pint
glass
plenty
of
head
with
sticky
foam
on
the
side
of
the
glass
this
beer
has
plenty
of
carbonation
that
even
after
a
few
minutes
is
giving
off
bubbles
strong
smell
of
corn
yeasty
smell
everything
you
would
come
to
expect
of
a
inexpensive
lagar
on
a
hot
day
this
is
very
refreshing
this
is
the
beer
that
started
it
all
for
me
my
first
beer
in
high
school
maybe
i
have
a
sweet
spot
for
it
but
if
im
out
playing
horseshoes
with
the
boys
or
in
the
need
of
something
refreshing
after
a
hot
day
at
work
this
is
where
i
go
for
a
cheap
refreshing
beer
not
much
for
the
other
light
flavored
beers
dont
get
me
wrong
if
you
hand
me
one
i
wont
turn
it
down
but
this
is
my
go
to
for
a
cool
off
after
work
if
you
dont
agree
i
dont
care
beer
advocate
would
be
nothing
if
all
we
did
was
bash
macro
lagers
overall
not
the
worst
macro
lager
but
by
no
means
my
favorite
dont
intend
to
drink
much
more
of
this
in
the
future
but
certainly
served
its
purpose
in
the
past
d
depends
not
a
great
beer
but
not
offensive
on
a
hot
july
nashville
day
its
seems
pretty
good
though
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
little
to
no
head
what
is
present
of
a
head
gives
way
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
a
slight
corn
but
not
really
anything
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
watery
but
of
slight
grains
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
slightly
over
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
beer
you
would
have
one
of
and
quit
it
is
very
simplistic
and
doesnt
have
very
much
character
to
it
d
none
i
finished
the
can
because
i
do
not
pur
beer
even
awful
beer
im
generally
not
one
to
trash
a
beer
this
thoroughly
but
this
might
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
tasted
i
figured
itd
be
inoffensive
enough
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
was
wrong
shouldve
stuck
to
pabst
this
beer
has
a
very
pale
brass
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
the
body
it
is
very
clear
it
actually
has
a
real
nice
thick
head
that
settles
to
a
moderate
head
with
some
staying
power
it
has
a
very
weird
fizzy
white
lace
it
has
a
very
grainy
adjunct
aroma
it
has
a
watery
body
with
some
carbonation
bite
the
flavor
has
some
mild
hops
but
it
has
a
lot
of
corny
tones
d
i
always
seem
to
enjoy
macros
a
bit
more
out
of
a
can
vs
a
bottle
i
drank
three
cans
of
this
easily
without
a
hitch
and
it
was
just
what
i
needed
on
this
hot
summer
day
ive
had
this
out
of
a
bottle
and
could
not
finish
it
so
there
is
that
d
this
beer
is
my
favorite
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
just
cause
its
a
classic
beer
that
you
cant
beat
for
its
price
drinkability
this
might
be
good
with
food
at
a
barbecue
or
something
but
its
nothing
special
d
good
drinking
gamesporting
eventbbq
beer
this
beer
gives
great
head
and
is
about
as
fizzy
as
any
i
have
drunk
drank
whatever
not
a
complex
brew
and
is
easy
to
drink
reminds
me
of
my
misspent
youth
and
the
price
has
seemed
to
go
up
much
since
then
this
is
still
my
first
choice
among
the
cheap
beers
it
was
clearly
very
pale
yellow
thrugh
the
clear
bottle
but
thats
fine
what
would
you
expect
it
smelled
of
corn
and
grain
like
any
other
adjuct
the
taste
was
ok
i
prefer
it
over
coors
any
day
it
was
very
corny
with
no
bitterness
whatsoever
mouthfeel
was
an
overcarbonated
water
all
together
a
drinkable
beer
for
a
big
party
or
something
since
its
so
cheap
and
readily
available
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
its
price
12
for
a
24
case
the
mouth
is
watery
as
water
very
thin
and
weak
flavor
is
weak
lemony
grass
and
cheap
grains
nothing
to
this
at
all
refreshing
yes
good
no
ill
pass
holy
hit
i
dont
believe
it
taste
is
not
as
bad
as
the
aroma
but
its
still
very
unremarkable
strange
sweetness
lots
of
corn
moreso
than
other
macros
i
think
id
rather
have
a
bud
or
a
pbr
over
this
stuff
wonder
if
its
any
better
out
of
the
bottle
drink
it
straight
from
the
can
to
spare
yourself
the
off
aroma
and
corn
pours
a
pale
straw
golden
yellow
with
a
large
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
dissolves
and
leaves
no
trace
of
existence
the
nose
is
filled
with
grain
and
some
earthy
hops
although
the
nose
overall
is
pretty
faint
i
would
say
that
is
mostly
grain
flavor
is
almost
identical
to
the
aroma
with
a
gentle
bitterness
its
light
bodied
and
is
very
carbonated
this
and
pbr
are
my
two
beers
of
choice
if
im
at
a
complete
dive
bar
or
if
im
going
to
camping
or
such
great
drinkability
this
is
what
i
used
to
drink
when
low
on
funds
it
is
the
champagne
of
beers
d
well
uh
yeah
its
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
as
the
bjcp
guidelines
says
it
is
but
so
is
water
this
beer
really
has
nothing
to
make
you
notice
it
which
is
fine
for
nonserious
beer
drinkers
and
it
fits
the
style
category
but
id
like
a
little
something
for
my
effort
i
enjoy
this
beer
im
not
sure
if
its
the
nostalgia
that
makes
me
like
it
or
if
its
just
a
decent
macro
probably
a
bit
of
both
this
is
not
a
beer
that
particularly
agrees
with
me
more
malt
less
corn
drinkability
is
good
not
much
to
excite
the
senses
but
refreshing
and
nonoffensive
ill
have
to
temper
my
disdain
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
medium
head
smells
like
sweet
nectar
pretty
tasty
for
a
super
cheap
beer
tastes
like
sweet
nectar
with
a
zest
of
honey
and
corn
watered
down
nice
and
refreshing
for
the
right
day
of
the
summer
nothing
quite
like
sitting
out
on
the
patio
on
a
hot
summer
day
sucking
down
a
cold
pitcher
of
miller
high
life
d
one
of
my
goto
beers
for
an
every
day
drinker
its
cheap
almost
as
cheap
as
the
beast
but
about
100x
better
and
good
for
what
its
worth
no
real
difference
between
can
and
bottle
to
me
great
drinkability
for
a
nonlight
beer
this
beats
any
other
and
the
price
wont
break
the
bank
either
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
any
sporting
event
when
youre
looking
to
pass
the
time
like
i
said
not
an
everyday
beer
but
it
works
well
in
a
pinch
excellent
drinkability
once
again
something
that
can
be
lended
to
the
marketing
but
this
a
great
beer
for
everybody
to
have
at
the
cookout
cheap
average
does
the
job
you
could
do
better
you
could
do
worse
all
in
all
it
is
a
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
is
not
over
filling
but
delivers
enough
flavor
to
make
it
substantially
better
than
your
average
macro
lager
d
it
is
what
it
is
i
got
a
twack
of
this
for
8
great
for
those
times
when
your
friends
who
have
no
money
come
over
and
just
want
to
get
drunk
overall
easydrinking
summertime
lawnmower
beer
not
great
but
not
horrible
living
the
high
life
high
life
passes
as
a
drinkable
macrolager
that
runs
a
few
nickles
cheaper
than
the
heavily
advertised
bmc
stuff
high
life
pbr
and
old
style
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
for
cheapass
beer
that
doesnt
bore
me
to
death
or
taste
like
vomit
d
so
easy
to
drink
nice
on
a
hot
day
d
it
is
what
it
is
pretty
drinkable
your
not
gonna
drink
this
when
you
want
a
nice
tasty
craft
beer
experience
the
champagne
of
beers
indeed
this
cult
macro
lager
is
clearly
mass
produced
and
not
of
the
most
interesting
or
flavorful
variety
but
with
its
fluted
casing
and
clean
bubbly
refreshing
flavor
it
will
forever
hold
a
place
in
my
heart
i
havent
had
any
beers
made
by
the
macros
since
2000
with
the
exception
of
reviewing
buds
american
ale
and
miller
high
life
this
is
the
only
beer
made
by
any
of
them
which
i
actually
go
to
as
a
default
beer
if
nothing
else
is
available
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
not
much
in
the
aroma
except
some
bready
malt
and
grain
taste
on
the
sweet
side
with
good
crispiness
aftertaste
had
some
veryt
light
lingering
honey
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
to
this
day
still
my
only
default
macro
beer
not
too
bad
bye
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
lager
for
the
style
certainly
not
terrible
but
not
one
id
want
to
drink
very
often
it
definitely
tasted
better
after
i
had
the
shot
of
old
overholt
though
nice
combo
d
same
as
the
mouthfeel
absolutely
stay
away
from
this
one
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
worst
of
the
macros
not
the
first
beer
id
reach
for
in
the
macro
section
of
the
beer
aisle
overall
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
simple
and
unexciting
having
never
tried
high
life
before
i
wasnt
sure
exactly
what
to
expect
im
actually
rather
enjoying
it
and
it
may
even
supplant
pbr
as
the
cheapie
of
choice
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
mouth
my
grandfather
used
to
drink
this
beer
while
mowing
the
lawn
in
the
summer
he
did
it
based
solely
on
how
refreshing
it
looked
hes
right
and
thats
why
im
scoring
it
so
high
on
appearance
it
smells
like
corn
but
not
too
strong
in
my
opinion
you
shouldnt
be
smelling
this
beer
anyway
beer
is
for
drinking
you
ass
it
tastes
crisp
and
fairly
clean
not
of
a
lot
of
corny
sliminess
that
happens
in
these
cheap
american
lagers
mouthfeel
is
on
target
of
the
style
light
and
the
drinkability
is
awesome
this
beer
is
designed
to
be
drank
in
a
session
clear
and
yellow
in
bottle
froths
slight
when
opened
smells
slightly
sour
and
urinelike
flavor
is
a
little
grainy
with
a
faint
flicker
of
hop
bitterness
but
mostly
a
flat
corny
sweetness
a
little
sourish
bitterness
on
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
leaving
a
little
sourness
behind
dgood
lawn
mowing
beer
outside
working
i
could
see
drinking
one
that
someone
handed
me
not
so
sure
the
situations
i
would
buy
it
in
tho
d
for
a
cheap
macro
its
pretty
easy
to
pound
these
puppies
all
night
long
so
if
your
at
a
college
party
and
your
already
drunk
might
as
well
knock
em
back
anyways
d
tolerable
id
enjoy
myself
if
a
college
party
had
this
as
its
staple
beer
mouth
is
light
and
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
really
quite
refreshing
drinks
fast
especially
on
a
hot
day
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
regularly
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
though
how
do
you
rate
drinkability
on
something
like
this
its
not
offensive
enough
to
pour
down
the
drain
but
also
something
where
id
probably
choose
water
soda
or
some
other
beer
if
served
at
a
party
thats
not
snobberythats
just
attempting
to
stay
a
contented
human
being
times
have
changedtheres
no
reason
for
beer
to
be
this
bland
so
not
my
new
favorite
beer
after
all
you
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
perfect
for
weddings
graduation
parties
or
a
short
budget
4
89
a
sixer
this
beer
is
designed
to
be
drinkable
by
the
masses
while
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
it
wouldnt
choose
it
either
there
is
just
so
much
more
potential
to
beer
d
yeah
its
drinkable
nothin
that
ill
hold
myself
to
drinking
by
the
case
but
its
the
average
joes
beer
and
its
an
all
around
good
beer
if
youre
really
not
into
microbrews
drinkability
ok
all
the
flaming
aside
this
is
where
this
beer
does
work
it
goes
down
as
smooth
as
honey
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
session
beer
for
a
bare
bone
price
this
is
it
this
is
actually
the
only
miller
product
that
i
will
actually
drink
under
my
own
provision
i
am
a
broke
college
student
so
i
cant
always
afford
my
favorite
beer
so
at
4
bucks
for
a
6
pack
of
tall
boy
cans
i
find
myself
drinking
alot
of
these
bottom
line
is
it
is
not
a
great
beer
it
is
a
relatively
decent
beer
that
wins
the
cheap
beer
war
between
natti
ice
busch
and
busch
light
i
must
say
there
are
some
great
memories
with
this
beer
but
it
is
nothing
special
overall
its
certainly
better
than
nati
light
but
certainly
not
something
i
would
drink
given
a
larger
budget
great
for
college
not
for
much
else
what
can
i
say
about
the
beer
of
champagnes
that
hasnt
already
been
said
to
me
high
life
is
the
lowest
possible
beer
you
can
buy
tastes
gross
too
fizzy
and
doesnt
even
get
you
drunk
unless
you
drink
like
twenty
while
running
laps
corpo
junk
brew
if
you
havent
had
it
then
dont
worry
im
sure
youll
be
able
to
see
it
at
every
store
in
the
entire
world
decent
drinkability
theres
not
much
to
fend
me
away
but
then
theres
also
not
much
to
draw
me
in
if
youre
at
a
gas
station
wondering
what
to
buy
in
the
45
dollar
range
this
is
it
poured
from
can
into
chalice
18
packet
christmas
gift
from
former
brewery
worker
pale
yellow
clear
appearance
head
is
fairly
tight
some
soapiness
little
to
no
lacing
smells
grainy
tastes
same
with
a
little
roasty
corn
hops
not
detected
finishes
pale
and
a
bit
sweet
too
sweet
for
me
poured
rest
in
for
cooking
brats
mouthfeel
great
in
terms
of
carb
light
body
not
unexpected
slightly
surprised
especially
in
terms
of
appearance
but
too
sweet
for
me
to
consider
good
session
wise
drinkability
im
on
my
2nd
in
this
tasteing
and
ill
be
drinking
the
other
4
this
evening
i
grew
up
in
the
corn
country
of
ill
and
had
many
of
these
growing
up
even
been
to
the
brewery
when
i
was
in
boot
camp
at
great
lakes
so
im
a
little
partial
to
this
beer
loved
it
then
and
love
it
now
will
always
be
my
stand
by
drinkability
the
drink
ability
to
this
is
great
for
sure
you
could
easily
have
one
of
these
and
want
many
more
its
one
of
the
better
american
macros
to
me
for
sure
full
flavor
is
here
for
the
style
of
what
it
is
it
is
better
than
many
of
the
other
macros
in
my
view
very
tasty
crisp
and
refreshing
and
you
have
to
also
admire
the
quality
considering
how
incredibly
low
the
cost
is
where
you
could
get
30
beers
for
only
13
bucks
pretty
incredible
considering
some
macros
are
7
or
more
bucks
and
not
even
better
at
all
good
for
what
they
are
they
are
a
one
i
would
visit
occasionally
especially
if
i
was
trying
to
stay
on
a
budget
appearance
is
light
golden
in
color
with
a
very
thin
head
and
lace
smell
has
a
very
light
sweet
adjunct
aroma
taste
is
a
light
but
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
and
the
hop
with
good
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
making
it
overall
one
of
the
best
american
adjunct
lagers
that
i
do
enjoy
drinking
what
a
delicious
beer
personally
i
would
rank
it
as
the
third
best
bmc
product
rich
golden
color
and
sweet
smell
and
a
bubbly
pour
the
beer
feels
great
in
your
mouth
but
more
importantly
tastes
amazing
just
a
great
allaround
beer
with
a
price
tag
that
is
begging
you
to
buy
it
it
has
a
nice
smooth
taste
that
you
usually
dont
find
in
a
cheap
beer
it
is
also
very
drinkable
its
not
filling
at
all
and
is
good
from
both
bottles
and
cans
drinkability
is
outstanding
as
i
could
probably
drink
10
of
these
in
a
night
if
i
wanted
to
drinkability
this
beer
is
extremely
light
and
goes
down
easy
well
suited
for
casual
drinking
games
with
a
group
because
it
doesnt
fill
you
up
an
average
macro
lager
no
standout
qualities
for
the
mass
market
tastes
as
it
has
a
decent
lager
cut
to
it
feels
like
carbonated
water
but
theres
nothing
really
horrible
about
this
beer
for
whatever
reason
it
seems
to
be
the
most
tolerable
macro
i
can
remember
but
obviously
id
still
avoid
it
if
i
can
help
it
but
hell
for
those
guys
who
just
drink
beer
for
the
effects
i
suppose
this
is
the
best
tasting
thing
you
can
get
for
about
the
cheapest
price
around
is
that
worth
anything
d
well
what
do
you
expect
from
a
value
priced
light
lager
i
personally
have
a
soft
spot
for
high
life
it
has
more
flavor
than
some
other
more
expensive
macro
lagers
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
way
too
many
of
these
not
a
great
beer
but
again
what
do
you
expect
from
the
champagne
of
beers
overall
one
of
the
better
adjuncts
in
my
book
decent
flavor
and
highly
drinkable
consume
in
large
quantities
overall
this
beer
is
what
it
is
a
decent
beer
at
a
cheap
price
its
not
a
beer
that
is
going
to
wow
anybody
or
make
someone
tell
all
of
their
friends
about
it
but
if
you
are
short
on
cash
and
need
some
beer
this
by
far
the
best
bet
for
your
money
poured
a
7
ounce
bottle
of
miller
high
life
into
my
sam
adams
sensory
glass
the
7
ounces
was
poured
aggressively
since
i
knew
i
had
plenty
of
glass
space
and
the
head
touches
the
sam
adams
boston
lager
line
the
appearance
is
average
3
0
but
i
guess
thats
good
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
up
through
the
yellow
swill
the
smell
is
neither
good
or
bad
there
just
isnt
any
the
taste
is
what
youd
expect
average
3
0
nothing
that
says
this
is
a
great
beer
mouthful
and
drinkability
go
from
average
3
0
to
good
4
0
because
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
a
night
of
socializing
i
guess
this
would
be
a
good
choice
high
life
is
the
king
of
cheap
beers
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
finest
of
the
bmc
beers
and
no
that
is
not
a
joke
this
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
and
tastes
smooth
and
bubbly
in
fact
for
a
macrobrew
the
taste
is
about
as
good
as
i
have
had
the
smell
is
a
bit
weird
and
is
the
only
true
knock
i
have
on
the
high
life
the
bottle
design
is
legendary
and
when
you
have
a
high
life
in
your
hand
at
a
college
party
you
feel
classy
even
though
you
have
spent
very
little
money
i
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
life
for
the
high
life
and
frequently
drink
even
when
i
have
more
expensive
better
options
to
choose
from
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
for
the
style
it
does
have
a
bit
of
gasiness
to
it
and
that
pulls
down
the
drinkability
score
drinkability
eh
ill
drink
it
if
you
set
it
in
front
of
me
or
give
it
to
me
free
its
basically
alcoholic
water
you
dont
drink
it
for
flavor
you
drink
it
for
the
effects
still
not
actively
unpleasant
and
there
are
worse
macros
out
there
straw
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
a
surprising
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
just
a
little
better
looking
than
most
macros
on
the
sweeter
side
of
aroma
and
taste
as
well
no
bitterness
or
hops
detected
nothing
really
spectacular
but
just
average
light
body
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
which
is
expected
in
the
style
an
average
macro
at
an
economical
price
i
am
convinced
that
my
dad
and
uncles
were
right
about
this
beer
unlike
pops
favorite
hamms
high
life
ranks
right
up
there
with
good
clean
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
fine
example
of
taste
price
look
mouthfeel
and
it
has
no
lingering
effects
of
yuck
afterwords
for
the
price
drink
the
crap
out
of
this
ah
the
high
life
fellas
the
high
life
overall
marginal
i
can
consistently
pick
up
a
4pack
16oz
cans
for
2
50
out
of
a
24
oz
can
this
classic
with
a
girl
on
the
moon
was
a
straw
gold
color
with
a
nice
twofinger
head
the
retention
was
good
and
it
left
curtains
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
grain
and
corn
mash
with
some
stale
notes
the
flavors
were
metallic
stale
and
yeast
with
all
the
mash
notes
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
slightly
citricsour
notes
that
arrived
as
it
warmed
up
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
rough
and
i
just
couldnt
get
past
the
flavors
as
it
warmed
up
d
decent
this
stuff
is
dirt
cheap
and
you
get
what
you
pay
for
bought
a
40
ouncer
just
because
i
could
i
must
say
i
now
understand
why
college
kids
buy
this
at
1
50
a
pop
it
tastes
like
junk
and
not
worth
a
penny
more
actually
they
should
pay
me
to
drink
it
i
guess
it
tastes
better
if
you
tape
it
to
your
hands
overall
drinkability
is
very
high
if
you
are
going
to
drink
a
beer
from
this
category
there
is
none
better
super
clean
and
refreshing
replace
your
daily
water
intake
with
miller
high
life
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
beer
is
very
clear
decent
head
retention
that
develops
a
nice
collar
and
good
laciness
simple
aroma
of
cereal
grains
primarily
barley
taste
is
also
simple
but
decent
mainley
barley
and
a
little
hops
simple
mouthfeel
light
and
thin
on
the
tongue
simple
but
enjoyable
beer
recommended
for
hanging
in
the
garage
or
in
the
outdoors
not
much
flavor
and
light
on
the
alcohol
for
recommendation
as
a
session
beer
drinkable
very
easy
to
put
alot
of
these
down
with
out
trying
not
filling
at
all
tried
living
the
high
life
for
the
first
time
for
the
cost
i
had
to
give
it
a
shot
standard
american
lager
look
yellow
color
but
one
thing
that
stood
out
is
the
incredibly
foamy
head
this
beer
creates
it
was
thick
and
quite
nice
looking
for
a
macro
lager
taste
was
decent
malt
and
corn
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
in
there
thin
in
the
mouth
and
a
standard
lager
smell
i
knocked
back
a
sixer
of
these
and
enjoyed
them
just
fine
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
for
those
looking
for
a
cheap
lager
to
go
with
the
game
ill
be
living
the
high
life
more
often
now
i
think
considering
the
price
the
type
of
beer
that
your
dad
might
drink
on
the
weekends
not
heavy
and
is
really
a
beer
for
those
times
that
your
short
in
cash
as
far
as
macros
go
its
not
bad
just
dont
smell
it
besides
that
i
dont
mind
the
high
life
i
like
the
clear
bottle
exposure
to
light
cant
hurt
it
anymore
than
it
already
is
it
pours
easy
and
it
drinks
easy
i
definitely
like
it
better
than
any
light
beer
and
anything
else
in
the
same
catgory
it
is
a
simple
cheap
macro
brew
that
pretty
much
anyone
can
stand
d
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
has
decent
flavor
a
really
nice
look
for
the
style
and
decent
feel
sure
it
smells
like
ass
but
its
a
macro
mind
you
i
am
not
comparing
this
beer
against
an
abyss
or
anything
just
other
macros
scoff
if
you
wish
but
if
high
life
was

rich
bitch
the
only
macrobrew
ill
willingly
purchase
and
keep
in
the
house
because
it
tastes
nothing
like
the
other
macros
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
tons
of
carbonation
creating
a
big
soapy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
in
its
wake
it
smells
very
much
like
corn
and
dead
grass
taste
is
mostly
bland
on
the
palate
though
some
of
the
corniness
no
pun
intended
is
detectable
and
is
actually
enjoyable
the
weight
is
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
try
this
beer
if
you
have
no
money
or
dont
want
to
get
drunk
while
drinking
a
12
pack
nose
is
about
like
the
keystone
i
just
tried
cheap
beer
night
with
some
faint
malty
note
that
lean
a
bit
to
corn
side
a
faint
dms
aroma
is
apparent
taste
is
not
so
hot
that
dms
came
back
and
it
has
a
bit
of
a
overthehill
character
akin
to
wet
cardboard
i
e
oxidation
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
astringent
i
dont
think
ill
having
another
unless
is
all
thats
left
in
the
boat
overall
this
one
is
pretty
bland
and
boring
nothing
exciting
pours
golden
with
a
large
head
pretty
smooth
for
a
light
beer
not
bitter
at
all
im
going
to
make
this
one
short
and
sweet
for
a
light
america
beer
it
isnt
bad
im
more
of
a
lagerbock
kinda
guy
but
this
isnt
a
bad
light
beer
also
great
for
playing
beer
pong
with
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
massive
amounts
of
head
and
some
very
decent
lacing
scent
was
fine
very
sweet
with
a
slight
jerky
undertone
nice
taste
crisp
and
refreshing
if
not
robust
little
bits
of
malt
with
noticable
adjuncts
very
sweet

it
does
go
down
very

of

racks
of
this

i
should
probably
review

a

with

taste
normally
considered
a

but
its
actually
not

bad
at

it
has
something
unike

and
shyt
like
that
some

come
in

this

is
a

on
a
curve
taking
in
account
the
taste
vs
price
aspect
as
for
all
of
the
mass
produced
big

out
there
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
much
better
then
coors

the

has
an

which
makes
it
quite

me
a

drank
straight
from

stronger

hard
to
get
by

itll
slow
you
down
considerably
overall
i
see
no
reason
for
high

when
lite
is
a
healthier
and

alternative
thatll
do
the

ill

can
i
say
about
this
beer
that

is
the
brew
i

it

decent

over

its

considering

the
fact
that
its

a

make
this
a
solid
choice
especially
since
it
comes
with
the

hangover
free
guarantee
my
cheap
stocked
brew
for

id
rather
have
a
red

a
grolsch
but
for
half
the
price
this
is
a
good
deal
d
not
a
horrible
beer
pretty
good
for
a
macro
just
too
light
for
my
tastes
it
has
a
pretty
good

was
holding
on
to
this

for
my

review
but
i
forgot
not
a
bad
beer
overall
great
to
wash
down
anything
from
a
grill
on
a
hot
day
a
decent
standout
against
to
many
lesser
choices
in
style
not
my
first
choice
but
a
good
go
to
macro
pours
a
clear
light
straw
color
with
a
dense
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
nice
cap
and
left
some
real
nice
chunk
lacing
the
smell
is
faint
corn
grain
metallic
protypcial
macro
stank
the
taste
is
of
corn
grain
but
has
a
slight
apple
tartness
that
cuts
the
artifical
sweetness
the
feel
is
light
watery
and
dry
probably
the
most
dry
macro
i
have
tried
perhaps
that
is
why
this
is
the
champagne
of
beers
one
of
the
better
macros
out
there
and
cheapest
cant
beat
12
for
a
30
pack
for
the
price
this
beer
cant
be
beat
ive
never
bothered
pouring
it
out
of
the
can
as
its
main
purpose
is
to
mostly
get
wasted
or
enjoy
a
really
cold
beer
at
the
bbq
or
while
mowing
the
lawn
smells
like
corn
tastes
like
a
sweet
beer
champange
hence
the
name
mothfeel
is
pretty
much
full
of
carbonation
but
not
like
a
soda
drinkablility
is
amazing
the
only
other
kind
of
beer
i
can
drink
like
this
might
be
newcastle
but
thats
expensive
at
15
bucks
a
12
pack
where
i
can
buy
a
dirty
30
of
the
high
life
for
11taxdep
this
beer
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
for
being
dirt
cheap
and
amazingly
drinkable
i
can
put
down
almost
half
a
30
at
parties
and
its
great
with
chinese
food
and
bbq
food
cant
go
wrong
with
living
the
high
life
just
wish
i
could
find
this
in
40s
there
is
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
that
is
good
not
for
me
anyway
the
beer
is
a
nice
light
gold
colour
that
is
reminiscent
of
american
lagers
there
is
no
discernable
smell
to
speak
of
nor
is
there
any
discernable
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
with
hints
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
try
again
nor
is
it
a
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
others
ive
been
drinking
high
life
for
many
years
and
even
when
i
say
im
not
gonna
drink
it
for
awhile
i
always
go
back
to
it
i
guess
its
my
goto
beer
thats
affordable
drinkable
and
respectable
it
is
to
me
an
american
classic
that
should
stay
around
forever
heres
to
american
lagers
heres
to
our
old
men
and
women
i
guess
and
grandpaps
and
heres
to
the
high
life
cheers
my
friends
id
take
this
brew
over
mgd
but
that
is
about
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
nice
and
cheap
a
good
college
brew
this
beer
would
be
bimmenselyb
improved
by
a
late
addition
of
saaz
or
some
other
spicy
noble
variety
tettnang
hallertauer
all
i
can
say
is
its
somewhat
refreshing
and
it
goes
down
easy
just
try
not
to
smell
or
taste
it
while
doing
so
i
guess
its
good
for
the
style
the
flavor
is
a
crisp
mix
of
pale
malts
and
corn
adjunct
no
hops
really
just
a
clean
beer
without
any
nasty
offflavors
one
of
the
better
macros
if
that
counts
for
anything
just
stick
to
pbr
if
youre
going
cheap
drinkability
is
outstanding
budweiser
is
full
of
shit
this
is
the
king
of
beers
this
being
my
first
review
i
wanted
to
go
with
a
beer
i
know
and
respect
overall
high
life
may
be
called
the
champagne
of
beers
but
is
more
like
a
sparkling
white
wine
not
excatly
from
the
champagne
region
of
france
if
you
know
what
i
mean
man
i
used
to
love
how
this
beer
looked
in
the
clear
bottle
and
loved
the
retro
coolness
now
i
know
they
do
some
frankenstein
shit
on
the
hops
so
they
dont
skunk
out
but
whatever
have
had
this
more
times
than
i
care
to
admit
10
30packs
were
a
fridge
staple
after
college
i
used
to
keep
a
glass
frozen
for
this
beer
since
it
is
almost
devoid
of
flavor
you
might
as
well
drink
it
super
cold
there
is
flavor
however
that
slightly
sweet
corn
adjunct
flavor
and
aroma
i
used
to
love
no
hops
or
malt
body
to
speak
of
light
pale
and
fizzy
poured
a
little
out
into
a
glass
to
judge
the
appearance
and
aroma
was
not
impressed
clear
straw
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
fastreceding
head
aroma
is
thin
and
malty
do
i
smell
corn
or
rice
or
both
because
i
definitely
do
not
smell
any
hops
considering
how
many
hop
fields
the
guys
at
miller
have
stationed
all
over
the
world
youd
think
they
could
do
something
to
make
their
beers
actually
smell
like
the
darn
things
the
taste
is
bland
but
crisp
and
clean
i
have
to
confess
that
i
like
the
high
life
because
its
very
drinkable
but
i
must
confess
that
i
dont
really
classify
it
as
beer
so
much
as
flavored
water
and
as
far
as
flavored
water
goes
its
really
not
too
bad
from
the
can
however
this
flavored
water
is
tinny
and
sharp
not
bad
if
you
need
to
clean
the
peanut
butter
off
the
roof
of
your
mouth
but
i
wouldnt
pair
it
with
a
fine
porterhouse
steak
or
anything
average
drinkability
just
because
it
does
go
down
easily
as
easy
as
any
flavored
water
ive
ever
had
another
one
of
your
run
of
the
mill
american
lagers
decent
flavor
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
satisfactory
carbonation
although
the
last
two
mouthfuls
are
pretty
darn
watery
my
advice
if
your
a
little
short
on
dough
grab
a
six
pack
of
this
stuffyou
could
do
worse
im
going
to
skip
the
astmd
etc
here
as
this
is
a
high
life
the
champagne
of
beers
obviously
its
a
macrolager
pale
straw
sticky
corntaste
for
some
reason
this
just
happens
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
cheap
american
macros
6
bucks
a
12
pack
very
sweet
refreshing
throw
a
lime
in
it
hah
and
its
the
poor
mans
corona
great
in
a
pinch
or
on
a
hot
day
for
tailgating
drinkability
compared
to
its
peers
this
beer
stands
up
for
itself
fairly
balanced
refreshing
and
drinkable
lightly
sweet
and
biscuity
this
is
for
a
taste
test
between
miller
high
life
and
mgd
as
per
forum
posts
this
same
day
beer
poured
from
24oz
big
can
into
large
okocim
glass
0
5l
this
glass
is
awesome
by
the
way
head
formation
was
brilliant
for
a
macro
lager
and
sticks
to
the
glass
in
large
chunks
puffy
cloudy
head
remains
after
a
few
sips
this
thing
wont
go
away
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
lesser
head
from
a
tripel
beer
a
very
pale
gold
with
tons
of
bubbles
its
so
nice
the
smell
is
not
great
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
very
smooth
and
crisp
almost
like
biting
into
an
apple
it
is
fairly
sweet
but
very
refreshing
this
definitely
goes
with
everybodys
idea
of
a
great
summer
beer
d
i
would
pick
mgd
over
miller
high
life
but
this
isnt
bad
my
scores
for
this
beer
are
judging
it
compared
to
its
style
which
got
it
a
5
bump
if
compared
to
most
microbrews
i
would
not
judge
this
beer
so
high
definitely
not
the
champagne
of
beers
carbonation
a
little
too
high
for
this
beer
it
overpowers
any
taste
it
might
try
to
have
aftertaste
is
bad
but
then
again
the
true
taste
is
nothing
impressive
decently
smooth
the
taste
is
distinct
but
not
in
the
best
way
of
all
the
cheap
beers
this
is
one
of
the
few
distinct
with
its
foul
aroma
and
bubbly
taste
dont
serve
warmer
than
ice
cold
its
typical
for
a
macro
with
the
exception
of
taste
its
a
classic
and
its
a
half
notch
above
average
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
for
a
macro
i
prefer
it
to
mgd
ice
cold
its
drinkable
not
sessionable
and
its
cheap
from
a
7
oz
bottle
pours
to
a
persistent
but
thin
white
head
with
bits
of
lace
pale
goldenstraw
color
aroma
is
corny
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
banana
ester
flavor
is
very
weak
a
bit
too
sweet
finishes
clean
and
sweetish
a
good
looking
beer
that
is
just
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
light
somewhat
watery
but
not
exactly
thin
the
light
body
and
lack
of
flavor
make
the
high
life
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
pick
for
an
undemanding
quencher
but
not
worth
seeking
out
over
most
other
macros
not
that
its
hard
to
find
or
anything
overall
pretty
much
average
macro
lager
meaning
pretty
much
a
belowaverage
beer
i
wouldnt
have
bothered
other
than
for
the
sake
of
completeness
how
can
anyone
hate
this
beer
yes
its
cheap
but
honestly
it
tastes
great
for
its
price
for
being
a
mass
produced
beer
it
is
incredibly
good
the
color
is
dull
and
the
smell
is
nothing
impressive
but
the
taste
is
perfectly
fine
and
the
head
is
is
quite
massive
very
carbonated
it
is
very
drinkable
and
finishes
fairly
smooth
i
would
say
this
is
the
real
beer
drinkers
cheap
beer
when
i
dont
have
the
cash
to
buy
a
case
of
sierra
nevada
ill
go
with
a
dirty
30
of
high
life
tastes
even
better
in
the
bottles
i
will
forever
respect
the
champagne
of
beers
cheers
d
it
is
still
a
descent
american
macro
lager
it
will
do
the
job
during
championship
week
on
espn
the
good
ole
high
life
havent
had
one
in
years
was
at
a
friends
and
we
opened
a
few
one
night
i
forgot
how
mellow
this
beer
is
nothing
at
all
stands
out
the
color
is
pale
straw
with
plenty
of
carbonation
to
create
a
nice
white
head
smell
was
very
plain
with
a
hint
of
grass
even
a
little
yeast
taste
is
very
light
not
much
to
detect
other
than
a
hint
of
grain
like
flavor
no
aftertaste
at
all
very
fizz
like
from
the
carbonation
for
a
mass
produced
beer
this
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
ones
about
as
middleoftheroad
as
it
gets
grainy
yellow
hue
grainy
smell
grainy
flavor
with
hints
of
sweetness
from
corn
grainy
mouthfeel
not
that
any
of
that
graininess
is
a
bad
thing
its
actually
kind
of
interesting
and
despite
the
ubermass
production
involved
it
tastes
pretty
natural
very
drinkable
with
my
only
complaint
being
that
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
hops
to
make
the
finish
a
bit
more
refreshing
probably
the
best
of
the
giganticbatch
american
macro
lagers
to
be
fair
beer
was
purchased
on
clearance
with
age
being
questionable
intend
to
review
again
at
a
later
time
and
ive
got
to
say
the
picture
with
the
empty
forties
is
the
icing
on
the
cake
the
most
drinkable
american
macro
imo
used
to
down
these
like
water
at
the
bowling
alley
in
my
personal
prohibition
time
cheap
and
available
everywhere
a
4
5
for
taste
compared
to
beers
of
this
style
not
compared
to
your
favorite
big
beer
a
pale
yellow
that
a
2watt
bulb
could
easily
penetrate
a
tall
foam
head
displays
its
high
carbonation
level
flavor
like
poorlyaged
corona
pretty
gross
id
suggest
bud
light
or
pabst
blue
ribbon
if
youre
looking
for
an
inexpensive
light
beer
this
pours
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
very
pale
and
watery
lookingmaking
this
not
very
attractive
the
smell
is
only
a
hint
of
vegatablescorn
and
nothing
else
it
was
so
weak
its
almost
nonexistant
the
taste
is
weak
and
watery
with
veggiescorn
and
sweet
malt
really
theirs
not
much
to
talk
about
the
mf
is
light
and
the
weak
flavors
mix
ok
this
is
what
it
is
a
beer
that
should
be
served
ice
cold
to
hide
its
imperfections
had
this
at
a
party
ice
cold
from
the
bottle
after
several
other
beers
nothing
special
here
just
a
typical
bmc
macro
okay
appearance
aroma
and
taste
of
grain
and
an
aftertaste
that
left
soemething
to
be
desired
however
in
the
absence
of
micros
and
good
imports
at
the
party
it
fit
the
bill
as
well
as
any
other
bmc
d
i
could
guzzle
this
stuff
on
a
hot
day
excellent
cheapo
summer
beer
if
you
want
to
slake
your
thirst
and
are
on
a
tight
budget
just
another
macro
lager
nothing
much
to
expect
here
this
actually
was
my
favorite
of
the
american
macro
lagers
back
when
i
first
started
with
beers
still
seems
sweeter
than
the
others
amls
overrall
this
beer
is
much
better
the
second
time
around
another
beer
from
my
younger
days
we
used
to
go
to
a
bar
in
ny
state
for
steamers
3
95
a
doz
that
was
a
saturday
ritual
along
with
miller
beer
pours
light
yellow
color
with
a
one
to
two
finger
head
with
some
lacing
smell
slight
corn
veggie
taste
same
mouthfeel
light
crisp
lots
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
best
served
nice
and
cold
d
great
american
macro
my
favorite
am
easy
to
drink
and
not
totally
bland
light
yellow
translucent
body
with
about
a
finger
of
head
smells
somewhat
malty
with
some
yeast
tastes
somewhat
sweet
corny
with
some
yeast
very
light
body
somewhat
watery
and
finishes
pretty
much
completely
clean
theres
some
off
flavor
to
it
though
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
it
not
impressed
but
not
dissappointed
either
this
pours
a
very
pale
fizzy
straw
color
with
a
large
head
and
great
retention
most
noted
for
the
light
and
frothy
head
as
far
as
the
smell
theres
nothing
there
a
bit
of
malts
here
some
grains
there
nothing
exciting
a
solid
taste
that
repeats
the
smell
with
a
bit
more
robustness
clean
and
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
well
balanced
but
lacks
in
complexity
drinkable
easy
to
finish
the
oldschool
40
oz
ive
had
better
ive
had
worse
not
bad
but
definitly
not
great
you
really
have
to
judge
this
in
regards
to
its
style
for
what
it
is
it
ranks
somewhere
behind
schlitz
for
me
poured
out
of
a
24
oz
can
tons
of
bubbles
straw
yellow
color
smells
really
clean
to
the
nose
not
offensive
goes
down
smooth
as
long
as
it
stays
cold
once
warmth
hits
its
every
man
for
himself
decent
enough
and
for
99
for
a
24
oz
can
makes
it
a
highly
drinkable
brew
when
you
are
faced
with
only
the
change
in
your
car
drink
holder
drinkability
for
a
wildly
popular
beer
that
you
can
get
anywhere
it
is
not
that
bad
great
cold
on
a
sunday
afternoon
watching
football
i
could
drink
this
untill
i
get
tired
of
drinking
tastless
beer
a
great
beer
in
a
cooler
full
of
ice
on
a
90
degree
dayother
than
a
very
uninteresting
beer
to
say
the
least
in
the
age
of
only
reviewing
good
beers
its
still
important
to
let
the
public
know
that
beers
like
miller
high
life
have
no
other
redeeming
qualities
than
to
get
people
drunk
offered
to
me
by
an
ol
college
buddy
a
notre
dame
tailgate
water
corn
adjuncts
mmm
boy
one
of
my
top
3
lager
macros
behind
pbr
and
schlitz
not
very
good
in
my
opinion
you
need
to
keep
it
cold
to
enjoy
it
good
luck
now
dont
get
me
wrong
but
this
sucker
has
a
pronounced
corny
taste
that
i
can
actually
respect
it
is
sweet
and
corny
but
in
a
way
i
can
identify
as
actual
corn
not
the
barnyard
leavings
of
some
beaked
bird
it
has
a
touch
of
the
bad
breath
i
find
on
my
burly
bearded
buddy
when
i
visit
him
in
the
cab
of
his
pickup
truck
he
was
living
there
for
a
few
months
when
i
am
angry
at
the
world
of
better
beer
and
my
wallet
is
in
turn
angry
at
me
i
will
reach
for
a
forty
of
this
wicked
foulness
is
a
way
that
keeps
me
giggling
and
cackling
inside
the
aroma
flavor
and
finish
is
all
sweet
corn
maybe
i
should
scarf
on
some
tamales
and
wash
it
down
with
this
one
a
very
carbonated
beer
makes
sense
i
guess
cause
it
is
the
champagne
of
beers
i
love
drinking
this
beer
inbetween
the
times
i
get
some
of
the
better
beers
i
cant
always
afford
the
better
beers
overal
this
is
a
beer
i
like
to
drink
kind
of
like
someone
else
would
drink
a
soda
or
something
typical
macro
taste
and
smell
here
lots
of
adjunct
in
the
nose
but
also
some
hop
action
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
almost
respectable
head
taste
is
mild
and
mouthfeel
is
pure
seltzer
aftertaste
is
fairly
terrible
gritty
and
burning
in
the
throat
you
could
do
worse
with
macro
and
it
is
cheap
but
ill
move
up
at
least
to
yeungling
next
time
and
let
the
mets
bats
do
the
work
just
to
bad
i
can
never
find
this
on
tap
anywhere
to
be
honest
im
not
really
sure
if
they
even
keg
this
stuff
they
really
should
though
d
good
for
washing
down
a
burger
or
acting
like
an
idiot
showing
up
to
a
party
with
two
30racks
of
it
it
isnt
really
the
champagne
of
beers
imo
but
if
you
want
to
live
your
trashy
side
for
a
night
cheers
to
ya
miller
high
life
was
a
very
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
had
fairly
decent
retention
leaving
a
little
lace
behind
the
smell
was
grainy
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
a
lightly
bitter
dry
finish
it
is
a
crisp
light
bodied
lager
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
are
on
a
tight
budget
the
taste
is
acceptable
its
cheaper
than
dirt
and
besides
it
is
the
champagne
of
beers
i
do
like
this
one
especially
out
of
the
can
its
really
a
nobrainer
the
less
you
think
about
this
one
the
better
it
tastes
miller
high
life
is
crisp
and
bubbly
hence
the
nickname
as
the
champagne
of
beers
but
dont
get
carried
away
with
this
name
high
life
is
pretty
ordinary
and
bland
overall
it
is
very
inexpensive
and
this
alone
will
continue
to
result
in
steady
sales
year
after
year
but
the
taste
is
very
plain
and
unexciting
the
type
of
beer
you
reach
for
when
you
need
some
crisp
refreshment
but
dont
want
anything
full
bodied
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
fair
head
retention
aroma
of
cooked
sweet
corn
somewhat
sweet
with
some
corn
flavor
a
bit
more
flavor
than
other
macros
restrained
hop
bitterness
however
it
does
not
become
cloying
light
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
this
may
be
a
small
step
above
the
usual
suspects
for
the
price
the
classic
bottle
and
15
a
thirty
pack
at
wal
mart
you
cant
go
wrong
this
is
the
champagne
of
beers
american
macros
anyway
both
this
and
pbr
have
enjoyed
quite
a
resurgence
on
the
local
beer
scene
over
the
past
few
years
theyve
become
more
of
a
staple
among
the
college
kids
which
is
o
k
as
long
as
its
anything
besides
the
putrid
ooze
that
is
bud
light
the
key
points
of
mhl
are
that
it
maintains
a
sweetness
of
flavor
that
is
not
overpowered
by
any
finishing
bitterness
the
main
flavors
are
corn
and
mild
grain
with
little
to
no
hops
if
all
you
have
at
your
disposal
is
domestic
macros
mhl
or
pbr
are
the
ways
to
go
overall
not
the
worst
macro
lagers
out
there
but
not
the
best
if
there
even
is
a
best
macro
lager
a
cool
old
dude
comes
in
the
beer
store
everyday
recently
retired
chaw
drippin
from
his
lower
lip
before
he
retired
every
weekday
boss
would
buy
a
deucedeuce
of
the
high
life
for
the
road
eventually
he
retired
and
i
would
see
him
only
on
two
or
three
random
days
a
week
when
he
would
do
menial
manual
chores
then
he
started
coming
in
almost
every
day
so
i
asked
him
why
hes
working
so
much
if
hes
retired
he
said
oh
you
know
gotta
stay
busy
i
just
realized
today
that
his
only
thrill
in
life
left
is
unapologetically
drinking
a
brew
while
driving
home
after
work
also
hes
an
old
man
he
can
get
away
with
anything
he
probably
has
a
garage
full
of
plates
in
case
he
gets
caught
that
is
how
i
will
live
my
last
quarter
century
salud
i
can
still
see
myself
buying
a
12pack
of
these
on
a
game
day
if
i
had
some
friends
over
but
i
wouldnt
drink
one
of
these
for
the
flavor
hittin
the
low
life
miller
high
life
is
a
confusing
beer
to
me
it
isnt
stale
and
doesnt
taste
like
it
was
sitting
in
a
wherehouse
for
a
year
like
mgd
but
has
the
very
corny
taste
of
a
miller
lite
confusing
brewery
anyways
nothing
is
yellowier
in
appearance
nothing
although
the
bottle
is
classic
which
is
what
you
want
to
drink
this
out
of
the
smell
is
of
very
faint
corn
making
it
hardly
offensive
but
not
impressive
nonetheless
the
taste
is
actually
damn
good
considering
its
price
for
a
12
pack
and
its
availability
better
than
most
other
swill
in
the
same
category
sans
pbr
the
moutfeel
is
watery
like
a
mexican
beer
but
has
a
stickiness
to
it
that
makes
it
seem
heavy
the
drinkability
is
the
absolute
high
point
of
this
beer
very
refreshing
and
you
can
down
these
like
water
which
is
exactly
what
they
are
good
for
about
as
average
as
average
can
get
my
dad
mentioned
to
me
that
when
mated
with
a
lime
slice
this
is
the
poor
mans
corona
ice
cold
with
a
lime
this
is
now
my
favorite
cheap
beer
while
high
life
has
a
bit
more
corn
taste
than
corona
close
enough
for
most
at
half
the
price
color
is
pretty
light
doesnt
have
any
outstanding
smell
but
you
can
tell
its
beer
taste
is
pretty
simple
little
malty
no
hops
to
speak
of
but
refreshing
none
the
less
feels
fairly
carbonated
compared
to
what
i
have
otherwise
been
drinking
lately
hence
the
champagne
of
beers
i
suppose
extremely
drinkable
and
at
six
for
the
price
of
one
micro
lately
you
cant
go
wrong
if
youre
strapped
for
cash
i
will
always
grab
a
miller
high
life
when
they
are
around
one
condition
they
must
be
very
cold
ill
be
buying
somemore
cheers
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
its
smoothness
comes
more
from
the
taste
and
the
feel
rather
than
the
water
as
is
the
case
with
most
american
macros
it
has
a
decent
taste
that
holds
on
for
awhile
making
this
much
better
than
most
others
of
its
style
in
fact
this
is
a
better
summer
thirst
quencher
than
most
craft
summer
brews
ive
had
and
it
is
very
inexpensive
considering
the
price
and
style
this
is
not
bad
at
all
a
good
one
to
bring
a
sixpack
of
when
going
to
the
pool
or
the
beach
d
its
a
macro
so
its
definitely
poundable
and
as
ive
found
with
most
miller
products
it
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
you
get
from
bud
or
coors
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
cheaper
out
there
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
major
american
macro
lagers
fairly
decent
golden
appearance
mild
head
sweet
smell
smooth
taste
with
slightly
malty
aftertaste
crisp
clean
and
cheap
it
does
what
it
was
intended
to
with
this
beer
you
get
what
you
pay
for
not
much
more
many
fun
nights
with
this
beer
in
college
and
beyond
what
does
one
look
for
when
drinking
an
american
macro
lager
he
wants
a
smooth
beer
with
some
flavor
not
too
much
he
wants
it
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
he
wants
a
nice
sweet
smell
as
well
as
far
as
american
macro
lagers
this
takes
the
cake
has
nice
flavor
and
doesnt
have
that
akward
dryness
that
mgd
has
much
better
than
mgd
miller
needs
to
make
this
their
main
beer
i
really
cant
complain
this
has
been
the
mainstay
beer
of
my
adolescence
life
and
you
know
what
it
has
done
the
job
it
gets
you
drunk
and
for
11
99
a
twentyfour
pack
it
isnt
all
that
bad
i
definitely
prefer
the
pabst
breweries
much
better
ive
had
much
better
times
with
rainier
schlitz
hamms
and
strohs
but
miller
high
life
has
always
been
a
standard
brew
that
is
easily
abtainable
anywhere
in
the
country
as
ive
matured
in
my
years
ive
tried
to
avoid
high
life
more
and
more
but
whenever
you
are
pinchin
pennies
high
life
always
tries
to
find
its
way
back
into
your
fridge
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
universally
available
cheap
domestic
lager
in
the
great
patriotic
nation
of
america
its
the
champagne
of
beers
d
a
good
lawn
mower
lager
probably
one
of
the
better
of
the
macros
i
would
say
its
my
bad
beer
go
to
easy
drinking
how
can
you
turn
down
the
champagne
of
beers
avoid
unless
the
woman
on
the
moon
is
handing
you
one
one
of
its
biggest
flaws
is
a
long
lasting
dry
aftertaste
not
really
a
beer
to
savor
more
of
a
beer
to
chug
down
it
is
the
king
of
miller
which
doesnt
say
much
i
physically
cannot
drink
cheap
macro
beers
anymore
whenever
i
do
i
get
an
upset
stomach
theres
not
much
to
say
that
hasnt
already
been
said
the
pour
is
golden
the
white
head
starts
out
frothy
then
fades
but
never
disappears
there
is
some
corn
in
the
nose
along
with
grain
the
taste
is
crisp
with
grain
and
light
hops
no
noticeable
corn
flavors
at
4
99
a
case
this
stuff
is
just
about
the
only
macro
worth
buying
perhaps
not
the
champagne
of
beers
but
certainly
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
i
think
this
tops
pbr
d
yeah
youll
forget
you
are
drinking
beer
d
high
easy
to
pound
in
sum
theres
definitely
a
reason
this
aged
recipe
has
endured
the
test
of
time
some
competitors
have
more
action
in
the
upper
register
but
this
one
is
hard
to
beat
for
a
good
fat
midrange
its
very
useful
as
a
yardstick
for
tasting
comparisons
too
solid
reliable
enjoyable
and
a
good
value
the
high
life
deserves
its
return
to
the
limelight
light
to
lightmedium
body
highly
overcarbonated
for
the
level
of
heaviness
finish
is
clean
and
dry
at
least
this
is
quite
refreshing
drinkability
of
this
beer
really
depends
on
the
context
its
drinkable
if
one
is
at
a
social
event
and
this
is
the
only
thing
available
theres
also
an
apparent
attraction
to
having
something
this
clean
and
dry
in
the
finish
on
a
warm
day
if
one
is
enjoying
beer
where
there
is
selection
however
theres
absolutely
no
reason
to
purchase
or
drink
this
this
is
the
best
beer
for
casual
drinking
forget
amstel
this
is
the
beer
drinkers
light
beer
it
must
be
consumed
in
bottles
for
one
to
fully
aprichiate
the
goodness
of
the
high
life
i
strongly
encorage
real
beer
drinkers
to
give
high
life
a
chance
it
might
not
look
classy
but
it
drinks
like
champange
if
im
going
to
buy
a
cheap
beer
at
a
bar
this
is
probably
what
im
going
to
get
it
goes
down
nicely
and
doesnt
get
revolting
if
the
temperature
drops
a
little
miller
high
life
is
also
great
on
a
hot
day
for
what
it
is
it
is
very
satisfying
dont
drink
this
with
a
lime
it
doesnt
need
one
found
one
in
the
fridge
downstairs
drank
about
half
of
it
for
this
rating
i
had
this
brew
at
a
neighbors
house
during
a
gettogether
i
know
that
ive
had
it
before
but
i
really
dont
recall
when
or
how
long
ago
its
an
extremely
light
clear
unassuming
straw
color
fizzy
white
head
no
real
aroma
at
all
i
couldnt
pick
out
any
hops
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
grain
very
faint
sweetness
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
other
than
that
the
flavor
is
absolutely
lifeless
watery
finish
if
you
could
call
it
that
theres
really
not
much
to
say
herethe
beer
has
no
flavor
and
no
character
call
it
yellow
fizz
water
that
about
sums
it
up
only
enjoyable
ice
cold
outside
on
a
hot
day
in
my
opinion
ive
lived
the
high
life
many
times
its
not
terrible
but
its
not
that
great
it
must
be
ice
cold
its
a
little
more
flavorful
than
miller
lite
which
is
why
i
choose
it
often
musings
ill
have
my
corn
on
the
cob
thank
you
leave
it
on
the
shelf
and
go
for
the
schlitz
or
pbr
poured
from
the
golden
can
into
an
american
pint
glass
lots
of
white
foam
appear
upon
pouring
lacing
throughout
the
entire
beer
piss
yellow
color
i
cant
pick
out
the
smell
of
hops
or
malt
both
are
probably
hidden
by
the
plethora
of
adjuncts
in
this
beer
taste
is
minimal
very
light
bodied
but
this
gives
it
a
thirst
quenching
appeal
these
are
good
on
a
hot
day
when
you
need
an
ice
cold
drink
to
cool
off
clean
in
the
mouth
but
alittle
sticky
on
the
lips
drinkability
is
this
beers
claim
to
fame
its
not
hard
to
drink
a
12pack
of
these
things
in
a
night
not
filling
not
a
high
abv
just
drinkable
beer
thats
all
this
beer
is
drinkable
im
not
going
to
comment
on
the
champagne
of
beers
assertion
ok
this
is
a
nice
cheap
beer
once
again
this
beer
isnt
meant
to
be
savored
its
pretty
sweet
and
id
agree
has
a
bit
of
a
corn
undertone
pours
a
decent
head
that
holds
well
but
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
is
easy
on
the
pockets
as
well
i
end
up
having
this
every
once
in
awhile
update
i
have
in
recent
weeks
made
a
conscious
effort
to
keep
my
fridge
stocked
with
bottled
high
life
at
all
times
i
have
always
enjoyed
hl
but
now
i
seem
to
have
decided
that
it
will
be
my
default
beer
for
when
id
rather
be
refreshed
than
worry
about
having
to
pay
attention
to
flavor
or
make
any
sort
of
investment
to
that
effect
indeed
there
are
many
nights
when
i
come
home
from
work
late
and
id
be
just
as
happy
to
have
two
or
three
hls
while
mindlessly
watching
tv
as
i
would
with
a
highquality
specialty
brew
that
i
can
sip
and
enjoy
for
a
while
i
will
note
also
that
as
a
rule
i
only
drink
hl
out
of
the
bottle
unlike
any
other
beer
i
drink
i
see
no
point
in
pouring
hl
into
a
glass
as
i
will
not
find
much
beauty
in
its
appearance
nor
do
i
feel
compelled
to
open
up
its
nose
as
i
will
not
be
put
in
awe
by
its
bouquet
no
give
me
cold
hl
in
the
bottle
where
itll
stay
colder
longer
by
the
way
and
im
all
right
drinkability
not
good
although
the
price
is
right
if
you
want
a
cheap
buzz
id
prefer
steel
reserve
personally
have
a
snooty
opinion
on
my
rating
if
you
want
but
as
far
as
style
goes
this
is
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
nice
light
mouthfeel
mixed
with
a
fantastic
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
if
it
only
had
a
touch
more
bitterness
it
would
be
even
better
and
yeah
the
price
is
right
at
9
99
a
24
pack
this
in
my
opinion
is
easily
the
best
of
the
megabrewery
american
offerings
you
can
tell
its
one
of
those
beers
but
its
really
not
all
that
bad
like
the
others
it
looks
like
urine
smells
almost
like
urine
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
urine
it
definitely
has
a
champagne
taste
to
it
i
cant
argue
with
their
motto
lol
to
me
its
extremely
similar
to
duvel
but
i
dare
say
to
me
it
is
better
perfect
for
buying
cans
in
bulk
and
drinking
a
the
beach
or
the
lake
first
there
is
a
daring
hops
presence
that
cant
be
found
in
any
other
massmarket
beers
not
bad
actually
it
also
isnt
sodasweet
like
bud
or
miller
its
actually
trying
to
taste
like
something
interesting
almost
floral
while
i
dont
care
for
the
slummy
champagne
of
beers
marketing
this
is
my
choice
if
im
forced
to
make
a
gas
station
beer
run
or
if
im
going
camping
with
friends
lets
give
it
credit
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
readily
available
beer
that
is
a
definite
step
up
from
bud
light
and
friends
sometimes
and
i
know
this
is
strange
i
just
dont
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
mellow
not
too
thin
because
of
all
the
carbonation
in
it
the
cola
of
beers
a
definate
economy
beer
but
very
drinkable
works
with
hot
weather
and
hot
dogs
best
served
ice
cold
beats
a
lot
of
cheap
beers
by
a
long
shot
notes
truly
the
champagne
of
beers
i
have
a
love
affair
with
this
beer
and
would
gladly
accept
one
any
day
of
the
week
not
the
highest
quality
macro
lager
i
have
tasted
but
definitely
my
favorite
the
price
and
the
epithet
champagne
a
la
christopher
walken
make
it
just
right
for
me
my
preferred
pokerbeer
pongdrinking
gamecookout
beer
this
beer
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
large
head
of
foam
it
was
so
pale
that
it
was
basically
just
a
shade
darker
than
water
the
aroma
was
very
uninviting
i
could
smell
a
mixture
of
rotting
tomatoes
and
a
kind
of
fruity
aroma
mixed
with
it
surprisingly
the
taste
was
not
too
bad
i
could
taste
the
ever
present
corn
and
adjuncts
but
there
was
also
a
nutty
aftertaste
that
was
kind
of
pleasing
honestly
i
dont
understand
how
anyone
could
put
out
a
product
like
this
and
still
make
money
id
take
a
bud
or
pbr
anyday
over
the
champagne
of
beers
not
recommended
drinkability
definetely
drinkable
im
surprised
i
havent
tried
it
until
now
but
im
quite
impressed
nothing
like
its
lite
counterpart
and
definetely
worth
the
price
recommended
for
a
macro
this
stuff
is
simple
but
pretty
good
a
12
pack
is
a
pretty
good
use
of
7
and
better
than
anything
else
in
the
price
range
except
yuengling
and
maybe
pbr
when
im
going
cheap
and
dont
feel
like
yuengling
traditional
lager
and
cant
find
pbr
this
does
the
trick
notes
if
its
on
sale
ill
pick
up
a
sixer
for
a
fishing
trip
or
the
likes
this
is
one
of
the
finer
macros
up
there
with
pabst
blue
ribbon
but
not
quite
well
im
not
sure
why
this
beer
is
so
much
worse
in
the
can
when
i
buy
a
macro
i
usually
get
cans
because
they
are
lighter
to
return
but
the
can
version
of
this
just
blows
in
comparision
this
poured
a
gold
color
with
an
allright
head
the
aroma
was
of
corn
and
harsh
ass
the
taste
is
similar
has
a
slight
sweet
hint
compared
to
the
bottle
though
the
taste
is
dirty
and
harsh
the
mouthfeel

kinda
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
for

evening
even
for

brew
this
beer
represents
the
average
i
guess
thats
pretty
much
what
theyre
going
for
though
every
once

i
have
to

up
a

just
to
remind
myself
of
why
i
spend
10
per
bottle
for
the
good
stuff
it
pretty
much
embodies
the
qualities
of
what
people
like
my
grandfather
expected
from
their
beer
essentially
something
devoid
of
any
immediate
bitterness
or
flavor
such
as
old

only
problem
was
it
was

im

still
is

is

the

of

also
the

is
very
low
i
drink
this
right
out
of

as
i
dont
see
much
point
in
pouring
this
one
so
it
is
a
good
choice
at

something
when
no

is
available
anyway
try
with

also

such

in

you
must

this
one
as
fresh
as
possible
or
youre
in
for

i
will
say
this
its
one
of
the

for

and
considering

not
overly
offensive
this
pours
smells
and
tastes
like
the
common
adjunct
lager
it
has
a
decent
amount
barley
graininess
with
some
rice
like
malts
the
tinny
after
taste
is
tempered
and
the
bubblegumlike
sweetness
that
i
find
common
in
the
style
is
present
but
soft
ahead
of
its
peers
but
this
is
a
style
thats
hard
to
pay
much
attention
too
its
cool
they
brought
back
an
original
recipe
and
i
agree
with
others
that
its
far
less
offensive
than
some
other
domestic
macros
but
again
not
something
i
ever
really
care
to
drink
again
a
little
more
grainy
in
malt
composition
than
others
less
adjuncty
ans
metallic
and
sweet
than
many
others
so
i
like
it
on
those
grounds
but
it
is
a
little
oxidized
in
the
bottle
stale
almost
and
the
hops
are
almost
entirely
absent
refreshing
enough
though
with
a
light
body
and
fine
carbonation
i
would
choose
this
one
over
a
lot
of
others
in
its
category
but
if
i
never
see
one
of
these
again
im
not
going
to
be
broken
up
about
it
a
nod
to
history
always
cool
but
the
beer
remains
woefully
pedestrian
you
couldnt
ask
much
more
out
of
a
beer
in
this
style
and
that
is
why
i
rated
it
so
highly
i
believe
it
is
the
best
in
class
i
drink
a
lot
of
craft
beer
but
sometimes
i
just
want
a
classic
lager
something
that
my
grandfather
would
have
drank
this
reminds
me
of
the
first
sip
of
beer
i
ever
had
it
is
head
and
shoulders
above
bud
miller
and
the
rest
of
the
competition
this
and
yeungling
are
right
at
the
top
for
the
style
tnot
offensive
at
all
with
a
little
hop
character
and
slight
achohol
with
little
corn
taste
my
favorite
aal
it
beats
budmillercoors
hands
down
light
but
tasty
malt
flavor
and
unlike
its
competitors
it
has
a
noticeable
hop
presence
it
makes
you
wonder
why
they
ever
changed
he
recipe
in
the
first
place
at
a
current
local
price
of
around
9
bucks12
pack
its
the
best
option
for
someone
on
a
budget
note
9
is
probably
more
than
people
pay

areas
hilife
and
pbr
cost
the

some
reason
cheap
beer
is

beer
is
priced
pretty
reasonably
best
american
domestic
i
have
ever
had
good
price
a
great
choice
when
you
want
a
regular
beer
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
i
think
is
a
best
in
class
had
it
in
bottles
looking
for
cans
by
the
case
this
is
the
best
aal
i
have
ever
had
best
of
the
big
boy
macros
overall
i
gave
this
such
a
high
rating
based
on
a
comparison
of
other
beers
of
its
type
at
7
and
change
for
a
12
pack
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
garbage
beer
i
was
shocked
at
the
first
taste
of
this
beer
best
adjunct
lager
ive
ever
tasted
pours
out
to
a
creamy
head
that
laces
well
light
gold
color
aroma
is
bready
grains
and
a
touch
of
hop
spice
flavor
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
clean
with
vinous
notes
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
tingly
very
good
wow
o
pretty
fantastic
really
considering
the
low
expectations
and
cheap
price
of
the
adjunct
its
really
sweet
and
while
the
malt
doesnt
hit
the
sweet
biscuitsbread
malt
range
its
doing
something
to
give
it
plenty
of
taste
and
the
grain
here
isnt
turning
the
whole
thing
into
a
liquid
tortilla
chip
again
its
just
giving
it
some
nice
sweet
taste
i
am
not
going
to
go
on
and
on
about
its
merits
however
if
you
can
find
this
awesome
nectar
of
the
gods
try
it
wow
what

old

beer
done

this

sweetness
mild

dryness

i
see

this
was

beer
in
america
for
a
long
time
overall
schlitz
is
a
great
example
of
an
adjunct
lager
glad
to
see
pabst
hasnt
totally
thrown
this
one
down
the
crapper
i
paid
12
49
for
the
12
pack
and
according
to
some
folks
from
across
the
country
i
got
ripped
off
but
its
still
a
great
little
lager
that
id
buy
again
no
problem
i
dont
get
this
often
because
i
only
see
it
in
suitcases
of
30
but
if
it
sold
in
six
packs
id
get
it
occasionally
it
is
a
decent
yet
cheap
beer
it
is
better
than
some
of
the
craft
beers
out
there
i
am
amazed
that
it
tastes
the
same
as
i
recall
from
1965
more
of
these
classic
recipes
should
come
back
vintage
reproguitars
vintage

are
fine
by

as

as

this

brought
this
over
for
me
to
give
it
a
go
not
much
to
look
at
weak
head
and
not
much
to
it
looks
like
tinted
water
with
minimal
head
decent
smell
though
has
me
more
optimistic
not
bad
flavor
weak
and
not
much
to
it
but
certainly
not
bad
and
easy
to
drink
would
not
buy
but
would
not
turn
down
o
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
and
frankly
was
disappointed
a
typical
aal
that
is
priced
way
too
high
for
what
you
get
since
i
wasnt
quite
of
beer
drinking
age
in
the
60s
other
than
the
occasional
sip
i
have
to
take
their
word
this
was
the
60s
formula
if
so
i
have
to
wonder
how
schlitz
ever
challenged
for
number
one
other
than
the
fact
their
competition
was
another
nondescript
aal
o
very
flavorful
representation
of
the
style
id
like
to
see
more
of
these
classic
recipes
come
back
itd
be
interesting
to
see
what
my
grandfather
drank
in
his
thirties
a
great
aal
style
beer
has
a
great
rich
flavor
with
good
hopmalt
balance
smooth
finish
with
slightly
sweet
grain
overtones
and
rich
bready
notes
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
no
watered
down
character
at
all
tastes
like
older
style
milwaukee
beers
used
to
the
perfect
lawnmower
beer
session
lager
or
summer
thirst
quencher
paid
5
99
for
a
six
pack
in
bottles
in
vonore
tennessee
beats
budweiser
coors
and
miller
for
only
a
slight
premium
in
price
worth
trying
at
least
once
a
pleasant
surprise
for
macro
lager
does
nothing
wrong
just
good
plain
beer
the
owners
of
pabst
have
no
idea
what
a
gem
they
have
on
their
hands
with
this
beer
o
the
least
offensive
of
all
macro
lagers
but
its
still
no
fun
to
drink
this
is
the
schlitz
of
my
youth
and
early
manhood
enjoy
ok
what
is
it
now
that
its
not
gusto
but
taste
like
gusto
but
not
in
a
gusto
can
anyway
glad
to
see
they
are
producing
this
a
little
more
after
its
summer
disappearance
beer
has
a
light
look
feel
pours
with
a
two
finger
head
into
a
schlitz
goblet
the
sip
is
clean
good
balance
like
a
macanudo
cigar
nothing
at
all
unpleasant
and
most
certainly
a
go
to
beer
for
all
occasions
this
isnt
a
craft
but
its
easily
still
one
of
the
most
balanced
drinkable
adjuncts
ive
ever
had
feel
the
nostalgia
to
back
when
the
gods
at
schlitz
ruled
the
earth
much
better
head
formation
and
retention
that
one
would
expect
for
an
adjunct
lager
corn
cereal
notes
very
present
in
the
aroma
overpowering
the
barley
when
tasting
the
corn
is
there
but
it
isnt
so
prominent
hop
flavor
is
mild
but
present
even
a
mild
hop
presence
is
much
more
than
your
average
american
macro
lager
this
beer
would
benefit
from
more
bitterness
i
think
too
much
corn
is
used
in
the
mash
bill
also
but
it
isnt
terrible
so
i
thought
id
give
this
a
go
based
on
some
of
the
above
average
reviews
for
an
american
lager
well
maybe
slightly
beeter
hard
to
say
i
personally
didnt
taste
any
hops
as
some
had
noted
its
maybe
an
above
average
lawn
mowing
beer
good
400
pm
beer
after
the
yard
works
done
nuff
said
overall
not
very
good
to
me
too
sour
and
metallic
is
what
theyre
offering
today
the
same
schlitz
as
back
then
hell
i
cant
tell
for
sure
my
taste
buds
have
changed
so
much
over
the
years
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
determine
all
i
can
say
is
this
beer
tastes
a
little
too
sweet
for
every
day
drinking
if
you
ask
me
they
used
to
advertise
that
it
had
just
a
kiss
of
the
hops
well
thats
for
sure
theres
hardly
any
noticeable
in
this
beer
to
me
its
fizzy
and
not
as
satisfying
as
it
once
was
its
hard
to
go
back
after
youve
tasted
heady
topper
like
it
did
years
ago
for
an
adjunct
lager
ill
take
this
one
way
before
the
vast
majority
of
the
others
in
its
class
it
doesnt
have
the
cornbrewed
taste
slapped
over
the
flavor
like
you
would
with
miller
nor
the
overly
crisp
profile
of
budweiser
its
what
an
adjunct
lager
should
be
surprise
i
liked
this
the
ultimate
lawnmower
beer
clean
drinkable
and
not
filling
snagged
a
single
could
easily
do
a
six
on
a
warm
day
like
today
i
hope
the
brewers
pay
attention
to
reviews
here
the
60s
formula
works
dont
revert
back
to
the
shit
that
made
your
brand
a
laughingstock
this
is
nice
solid
beer
overallthis
is
is
5
i
have
drank
the
standard
american
lagers
bud
high
life
pbr
red
stripe
and
this
is
the
best
of
t
hem
all
i
will
take
this
over
any
craft
beers
s
any
day
this
will
s
a
true
staple
beer
o
probably
the
most
enjoyable
aal
that
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
is
a
darn
shame
that
they
stopped
using
this
as
the
main
recipe
sometime
in
the
1970s
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
nicely
balanced
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
without
leaving
out
their
flavors
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
citrus
zest
and
floral
hops
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice
hop
aromas
and
flavors
for
the
style
o
full
discretion
i
actually
like
aals
this
one
is
right
up
there
in
the
top
of
the
tops
probably
better
than
gansett
the
light
toasted
element
gives
it
a
nice
splash
of
flavor
while
remaining
light
and
drinkable
drank
gallons
of
this
before
the
great
frank
sellinger
improvement
of
the
late
1970s
which
rightfully
put
the
company
out
of
business
the
new
reformulated
brew
tastes
just
like
the
schlitz
of
old
was
the
best
mass
produced
beer
then
and
still
is
with
this
formula
just
make
sure
you
get
the
new
reformulated
stuff
and
not
the
bargain
basement
stuff
usually
found
in
the
12
oz
cans
at
the
quickie
marts
better
than
bud
better
than
coors
and
better
than
miller
cannot
top
the
microbrews
but
it
never
was
intended
to
compete
with
this
market
hope
they
keep
producing
this
o
as
far
as
aals
go
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
look
past
the
miller
lites
budweisers
and
coors
out
there
and
grab
some
of
this
theres
a
lot
more
depth
to
this
beer
for
the
same
price
and
same
abv
in
my
opinion
there
is
absolutely
zero
reason
to
buy
any
of
the
bmc
beers
over
this
unless
of
course
you
cannot
find
it
which
is
definitely
possible
because
only
one
beer
store
in
my
area
carries
it
high
c
overall
for
a
adjunct
pale
lager
its
really
not
bad
id
reach
for
this
at
a
bbq
over
any
other
in
its
class
but
definetly
not
a
craft
pilsner
style
beer
served
in
a
tall
boy
and
not
easy
to
get
around
ri
as
compared
to
pbr
gansett
rolling
rock
or
coors
banquet
adjuncts
with
old
school
cache
this
my
favorite
of
the
retro
lagers
enjoyable
and
drinkable
the
tall
boy
presentation
was
nice
but
id
prefer
a
12
oz
the
color
was
unknown
as
i
drink
from
the
can
the
nose
was
real
beer
taste
was
full
and
crisp
beer
taste
clean
after
taste
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
because
i
think
i
received
a
bad
can
i
will
update
my
review
if
i
find
it
better
in
the
future
o
again
probably
my
favorite
of
the
rebranded
american
adjunct
beers
i
gave
it
an
overall
score
of
4
because
i
believe
it
to
be
above
average
in
that
it
delivered
everything
i
was
looking
for
in
this
particular
beer
flavorful
refreshing
and
an
all
around
solid
beer
super
underrated
and
very
well
done
most
likely
wont
appeal
to
fans
of
big
beers
but
this
beer
certainly
has
its
place
for
whatever
reason
here
in
central
pa
schlitz
has
become
almost
impossible
to
get
i
picked
this
up
at
a
distro
in
chester
county
and
will
make
it
a
point
to
stock
up
overall
a
very
light
german
pils
with
a
hint
of
saaz
hops
i
would
guess
quite
pleasant
given
its
competition
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
chimay
chalice
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
bigbubbled
head
that
slips
down
to
a
little
ring
clean
lagery
aroma
theres
actually
a
nice
spicy
hop
note
which
is
surprising
a
bit
of
lemon
sweet
cereal
grain
and
a
touch
of
sulfur
chuggable
inoffensive
flavor
crisp
spicy
hop
and
grain
not
bad
at
all
i
could
drink
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
these
on
a
hot
day
or
anytime
for
that
matter
this
just
might
be
my
goto
cheap
beer
of
choice
from
now
on
schlitz
i
usually
drink
wheat
beers
during
the
summer
but
thought
i
would
work
through
the
classic
mass
produced
us
beers
as
a
change
of
pace
the
schlitz
has
a
darker
golden
color
light
carbonation
and
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
very
mild
the
malt
flavor
is
up
front
and
finishes
with
some
bitter
the
only
drawback
to
this
beer
is
an
abrasive
aftertaste
which
takes
it
off
of
my
list
pbr
still
holds
the
lead
stay
tuned
a
very
well
done
and
refreshing
aal
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
the
greatest
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
price
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
tall
boys
on
sale
for
4
all
in
all
id
say
this
has
become
my
new
favorite
american
adjunct
ive
had
so
far
i
usually
pick
up
budweiser
high
life
and
pabst
but
id
say
this
tops
them
all
in
my
opinion
not
sure
i
could
say
the
same
if
they
hadnt
reintroduced
the
classic
formula
before
i
hit
21
but
oh
well
lucky
me
however
if
you
like
more
malt
and
less
bitter
hops
id
go
with
something
else
the
only
downside
about
this
beer
is
that
i
cant
get
it
where
i
currently
live
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
couple
12
packs
each
time
im
home
from
college
anyway
a
refreshing
satisfying
adjunct
to
quench
your
thirst
and
catch
a
buzz
on
a
hot
summer
day
now
all
i
need
is
a
wife
with
a
beehive
and
a
64
chevy
in
the
driveway
had
this
at
the
pamdemonium
mensa
gathering
aroma
is
weak
but
one
does
get
a
hint
of
malt
it
pours
a
typical
clear
yellow
with
an
unremarkable
white
head
flavor
though
is
better
than
i
expected
strong
malty
and
just
a
little
fruity
body
leaves
something
to
be
desired
but
not
the
fizz
overall
not
bad
for
an
industrial
lager
better
at
45f
rather
than
right
from
a
37f
fridge
o
not
quite
as
dry
as
most
aals
which
allows
a
bit
of
the
sweet
malt
character
to
come
out
pretty
nice
for
the
style
in
conclusion
after
such
a
long
story
its
nice
to
have
an
american
adjunct
lager
on
the
market
thats
got
some
hops
to
it
and
a
bit
of
malt
flavor
as
well
this
is
by
far
the
best
macro
brew
that
you
can
get
granted
it
is
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
micro
brew
stuff
however
i
was
surprised
about
how
good
this
is
schlitz
60s
recipe
is
hands
down
the
best
aal
available
i
buy
it
often
as
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
beers
the
appearance
is
rich
golden
hue
and
the
head
actually
lacesclumps
the
smell
is
grainy
yeasty
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
malt
forward
with
the
adjunct
adding
prickly
crispness
while
the
noticeable
hops
finishes
very
cleanly
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
4
7abv
i
believe
this
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
available
anywhere
esp
relative
to
pricing
on
a
recent
adventure
to
millwaukee
i
was
offered
a
tall
boy
of
schlitz
the
classic
60s
formula
it
poured
light
golden
with
sticky
white
foam
a
sweet
bready
aroma
wafted
above
the
glass
this
trend
continued
onto
the
palate
was
a
tad
hollow
in
the
center
before
being
whisked
away
with
the
lightest
dash
of
hops
i
highly
drinkable
and
gentle
brew
not
bad
really
bought
at
a
roadside
dive
bar
last
night
in
noblestown
pa
damn
this
beer
was
drinking
smooth
for
a
beer
that
just
drinks
like
a
classic
this
is
the
beer
that
made
milwaukee
famous
pours
a
sparkling
pale
light
golden
color
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
thick
actually
holds
onto
the
head
quite
a
bit
fine
speckled
lacing
layers
arounds
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
abright
cereal
grain
sweetness
seems
a
bit
mineral
in
the
middle
but
overall
a
nice
sweetness
meant
to
be
drank
by
the
masses
especially
during
the
industrial
revolution
this
neck
label
states
that
this
is
the
classic
1960s
formula
drinks
so
nicely
semie
sweet
cereal
notes
goes
down
smooth
its
actually
chuggable
and
likeable
and
sessionable
amazing
that
an
old
retro
beer
can
come
back
and
actually
be
drinkable
for
someone
like
me
who
has
tried
almost
2500
different
beers
happy
to
see
this
brew
in
a
dive
bar
i
actually
took
a
six
pack
home
and
cleared
them
out
of
their
schlitz
supply
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
yellow
color
not
much
to
really
say
here
it
had
a
small
white
head
on
top
for
a
little
while
but
faded
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
of
corn
and
other
grains
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
light
clean
and
simple
no
levels
of
complexity
at
all
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
drinkable
i
drank
it
rather
quickly
just
to
finish
it
overall
i
bought
a
bottle
with
the
only
intention
of
saying
i
had
it
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
from
it
or
even
expecting
to
like
it
its
a
beer
that
wraps
it
up
pretty
well
i
think
overall
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
this
style
it
was
refreshing
and
just
sitting
back
and
drinking
one
is
a
pleasant
experience
o
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
some
flavor
goes
down
easy
and
for
the
price
5
696
pack
you
really
cant
beat
it
poured
into
an
old
schlitz
flared
pilsner
glass
pours
straw
colored
with
a
fluffy
white
head
and
has
abundant
carbonation
the
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
smells
of
light
malt
the
taste
is
crisp
with
good
light
malt
and
hop
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
light
for
this
is
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
there
is
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
if
i
need
a
go
to
american
adjunct
lager
as
a
session
beer
i
would
look
no
further
than
schlitz
o
it
certainly
looks
nice
it
wont
overwhelm
you
in
any
category
but
this
is
the
way
to
go
if
you
are
strapped
for
cash
or
need
a
light
fizzy
drink
very
light
flavor
of
noble
hops
some
sweet
malt
crisp
lager
finish
refreshing
watery
spritzy
and
tall
this
is
a
goto
for
trivia
night
3
a
can
i
prefer
it
a
little
more
to
high
life
or
something
like
that
theres
a
little
more
flavor
but
i
can
still
pound
these
all
night
and
rock
it
out
with
the
woo
dudes
like
a
boss
overall
this
is
my
go
to
adjunct
brew
not
just
a
lawnmower
beer
but
a
spacera
beer
to
drink
in
between
expensive
beers
just
as
good
as
bud
miller
pbr
and
at
the
price
im
getting
them
for
id
be
crazy
not
to
pick
up
a
12
or
2
on
the
weekendevery
weekend
overall
a
tasty
macro
m
lighter
side
of
medium
flavor
yet
strangely
undercarbonated
it
just
lies
limp
on
my
tongue
without
any
effervescence
at
all
just
a
terrible
product
pabsts
new
owners
are
doing
a
great
job
of
ruining
the
company
which
began
to
catch
as
a
fluke
i
wish
this
beer
would
take
off
and
take
market
share
from
bmc
but
i
fear
bmcs
grip
on
the
minds
of
american
consumers
is
too
strong
o
the
best
aal
ive
ever
had
bmc
should
be
keeping
an
eye
on
this
one
i
could
see
this
coming
back
and
staking
a
claim
in
the
aal
landscape
blows
the
other
aals
ive
tried
out
of
the
water
no
pun
intended
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
thirst
quenching
lager
with
some
gritty
character
the
overall
flavour
and
character
makes
up
for
the
too
thin
body
and
mouthfeel
i
like
it
and
happy
10
year
ba
birthday
to
me
now
on
to
the
good
stuff
o
certainly
one
of
the
better
macro
lagers
ive
had
the
price
is
good
though
full
sail
session
is
better
at
the
same
price
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
budweiser
saw
some
hype
about
a
return
to
to
the
classic
formula
i
was
not
impressed
seems
to
be
the
same
old
macro
lager
taste
that
is
acceptable
when
very
cold
but
nothing
great
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
acceptable
as
a
spacer
but
not
much
else
very
dissapointing
overall
pretty
good
an
old
friend
returns
overall
this
is
pretty
inoffensive
lacks
a
little
bit
of
flavor
isnt
noticeably
faulty
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
most
adjuncts
ive
had
its
pretty
easy
i
must
say
but
i
think
thats
part
of
its
charm
which
makes
it
nice
i
could
have
several
of
these
and
enjoy
myself
no
problem
perhaps
the
60s
were
better
for
beer
after
all
in
america
uh
probably
not
all
things
considering
o
wow
very
good
for
the
style
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
lacks
many
of
the
off
flavors
associated
with
others
in
the
style
only
downside
to
this
one
is
its
a
little
pricey
for
what
it
is
and
hard
to
find
in
my
area
this
is
definitely
all
the
aal
can
be
i
had
this
and
i
swore
it
was
something
else
for
the
style
it
is
very
nice
drinkable
for
certain
i
caught
a
whiff
of
hops
but
mainly
the
typical
adjunct
effects
the
taste
though
was
grand
i
knew
i
was
drinking
something
a
little
more
upscale
than
whats
marketed
nowadays
the
only
true
downside
to
this
beer
is
its
appearance
this
is
a
lawnmower
beer
that
i
probably
would
only
drink
in
the
summer
o
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
ok
likewise
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
taste
is
light
and
airy
cleaner
than
regular
schlitz
it
seems
like
although
the
differences
are
not
too
wide
not
bad
seems
to
be
a
little
bit
of
a
leafy
hop
bitterness
on
the
end
which
is
nice
i
got
this
as
a
single
but
i
saw
sixers
of
this
selling
for
as
much
as
coors
or
bud
schlitz
has
always
been
a
decent
bargain
beer
but
at
premium
prices
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
much
for
an
aal
this
falls
right
on
the
better
side
of
middling
pours
light
gold
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
that
lingers
fairly
well
scent
is
typical
baseball
stadium
beer
taste
is
ricy
with
a
tin
twang
to
it
but
crisp
and
clean
one
of
the
better
adjuncts
o
overall
though
im
sure
my
judging
on
the
appearance
and
smell
will
probably
bring
my
overall
grade
down
i
honestly
think
this
is
a
fantastic
every
day
beer
especially
if
price
is
a
factor
if
this
were
more
prevalent
in
liquor
stores
in
my
area
it
would
be
my
regular
go
to
beer
too
bad
the
only
place
ive
seen
that
sells
it
around
these
parts
is
forty
five
minutes
away
from
me
standard
american
adjunct
fare
without
the
big
advertising
campaign
so
its
relatively
cheap
hint
of
hops
hint
of
barley
but
mostly
corn
or
rice
or
something
else
super
light
that
doesnt
impart
much
flavor
always
highly
carbonated
a
good
palate
cleanser
this
beer
works
on
any
hot
day
inwhich
you
want
a
cheap
decent
beer
at
5
99six
pack
its
pretty
solid
this
has
replaced
pbr
as
my
cheap
american
lager
of
choice
goes
great
with
football
games
o
not
bad
at
all
just
looking
for
something
light
to
have
during
the
week
paid
12
99
plus
tax
for
this
case
that
date
has
come
and
gone
i
just
recently
had
fort
george
1811
preprohibition
lager
which
blows
schlitz
and
every
other
aal
ive
had
out
of
the
water
i
wish
it
had
more
body
and
barley
flavor
but
this
is
pretty
darn
good
for
u
s
macro
i
get
more
too
i
drank
a
6
pack
of
bottles
without
pouring
into
a
glass
beer
did
not
seem
overcarbonated
and
smelled
very
fresh
when
i
popped
the
cap
the
balance
of
malt
corn
and
light
hops
was
pleasing
and
the
floral
notes
from
the
kiss
o
hops
sorry
had
to
do
it
made
this
classic
both
interesting
and
drinkable
the
pabst
stable
is
really
putting
out
some
great
beers
these
days
and
this
is
one
of
them
i
would
put
this
up
against
many
of
canadian
or
euromacros
any
day
go
for
the
gusto
when
funds
are
tight
you
cant
go
wrong
with
18
a
case
for
this
id
rather
have
any
number
of
craft
beers
over
this
but
at
least
it
proves
that
its
possible
to
brew
a
relatively
flavorful
and
satisfying
beer
in
the
style
exceptional
for
the
style
o
surprisingly
enjoyable
adjunct
lager
why
the
hell
did
they
change
the
formula
anyways
more
adjuncts
should
have
legitimate
flavors
like
this
congrats
schlitz
quality
vs
quantity
ftw
what
can
i
say
this
is
american
beer
at
its
best
that
is
if
you
are
talking
adjunct
lagers
i
just
like
to
call
it
an
american
lager
goes
down
to
easy
great
year
around
beer
if
you
are
broke
you
cannot
go
wrong
o
not
too
bad
really
a
basic
beer
for
the
summertime
a
step
up
from
the
plain
bmc
good
for
just
watching
the
game
a
fitting
tribute
to
our
manufacturing
past
and
the
beer
that
almost
beat
budweiser
o
this
is
a
good
beer
in
an
era
where
mass
produced
lagers
dominated
the
market
its
easy
to
see
how
this
is
the
beer
that
made
milwaukee
famous
it
kind
of
transports
me
to
some
extent
i
think
if
i
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
a
beer
with
my
grandfather
and
great
grandfather
in
the
garage
or
maybe
the
boathouse
well
it
might
have
been
an
ice
cold
schlitz
having
now
tried
this
classic
recipe
i
can
see
why
this
beer
was
once
so
popular
it
does
feel
like
a
true
throwback
that
im
tasting
what
all
the
guys
in
my
grandfathers
tavern
were
enjoying
back
in
the
day
anyone
who
writes
this
off
simply
because
of
the
style
is
missing
out
on
a
fun
beverage
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
is
worth
your
attention
keep
in
mind
when
reviewing
this
beer
that
its
not
competing
with
a
craft
brew
but
other
aals
when
you
consider
that
90
of
the
beer
sold
at
the
corner
shop
is
crap
those
are
the
beers
that
you
need
to
compare
this
one
to
in
that
context
it
excels
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
we
built
schlitz
city
overall
a
good
lager
at
a
good
price
if
only
all
cheap
american
beer
tasted
like
this
pours
a
clear
yellowgolden
color
with
a
pretty
good
white
head
and
some
slight
lacing
the
nose
brings
a
bit
of
bread
and
some
light
corn
character
nothing
cooked
or
dmslike
but
the
use
of
adjuncts
is
noticeable
flavor
falls
along
the
same
lines
nothing
offensive
its
fairly
bland
but
does
have
a
bit
of
malt
flavor
light
body
and
slightly
chewy
average
carbonation
i
wouldnt
complain
about
drinking
this
again
overall
my
go
to
american
adjunct
lager
i
had
been
waiting
for
this
to
come
to
nc
and
it
didnt
disappoint
o
schlitz
gusto
is
hands
down
the
best
aal
on
the
market
nothing
even
comes
close
this
brew
is
a
game
changer
and
absolutely
deserves
the
high
marks
it
receives
seek
this
out
regardless
of
style
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
a
quiet
enjoyable
beer
it
is
a
shame
this
isnt
the
top
seller
in
the
country
overall
a
very
good
lager
the
best
adjunct
lager
ive
ever
had
taste
is
a
firm
lightly
fruity
grain
lightly
sweet
malty
body
with
light
apple
and
a
balancing
light
but
very
firm
zesty
hop
bitterness
that
in
character
is
grassy
with
light
herbal
element
that
is
almost
minty
it
is
a
simple
straightforward
traditional
american
lager
but
with
unusually
good
malty
and
hoppy
body
and
character
with
the
hop
flavour
and
bitterness
really
standing
out
complared
to
others
in
the
style
this
is
better
than
the
regular
modern
schlitz
and
really
stands
out
in
the
class
after
drinking
this
and
comparing
it
to
several
other
such
american
lagers
at
the
time
the
others
are
utterly
bland
and
rough
by
comparison
o
first
time
having
this
one
its
actually
quite
nice
far
better
than
any
aal
ive
had
having
this
while
i
bbq
outside
it
pairs
perfect
this
will
make
more
appearances
in
my
fridge
odperhaps
narragansett
lager
has
been
supplanted
in
the
category
of
best
macro
in
my
book
by
the
gusto
the
light
body
combined
with
the
clean
grassy
hops
really
make
this
one
a
winner
my
new
goto
noncraft
i
think
so
poured
right
down
the
middle
of
the
glass
gave
a
nice
two
fingered
white
head
head
didnt
hang
around
to
long
but
head
did
settle
down
to
about
one
eighth
inch
then
dissapated
nice
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
beer
itself
was
a
light
golden
color
smelled
slightly
sweet
also
notes
of
corn
and
malt
actually
taste
i
thought
quite
good
not
bitter
but
did
have
a
sweet
taste
not
real
heavy
on
sweetness
just
slightly
sweet
probably
from
the
malt
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
i
thought
was
good
ill
buy
again
i
thought
better
than
pbr
or
coors
would
make
a
good
session
beer
or
lawnmower
beer
the
taste
has
light
grains
but
a
whole
lot
of
corn
this
has
a
big
corn
taste
and
really
is
like
corn
water
but
again
there
is
nothing
offensive
in
the
taste
just
a
boring
beer
instead
of
cussing
the
s
word
i
now
have
a
saying
ah

but
not
a
lot
it
doesnt
have
that
watered
down
weak
taste
that
so
many
american
adjunct
lagers
have
all
in
all
its
worth
the
money
it
is
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
it
is
about
this
beer
but
i
like
it
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
musty
grainy
aromas
start
off
the
top
with
a
little
weird
spice
from
somewhere
it
doesnt
smell
too
off
putting
its
just
odd
the
taste
of
woodsy
grain
starts
off
the
palette
the
sweet
taste
of
sweet
grains
mix
in
to
the
middle
of
it
and
it
turns
to
a
high
grain
cracker
it
finishes
as
a
bready
dry
finish
i
find
this
beer
exceedingly
drinkable
its
not
an
overly
impressive
beer
very
basic
but
i
like
it
dive
been
meaning
to
try
it
for
awhile
and
they
always
try
and
pick
some
beer
for
me
so
i
cant
complain
d
this
is
probably
the
best
brew
of
this
style
that
ive
had
it
tastes
like
a
real
beer
unlike
others
of
this
style
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
lively
three
finger
white
frothy
head
smells
of
sweet
hops
shockingly
awesome
especially
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
yeast
and
grain
like
youd
expect
but
no
metallic
tastes
of
high
carbonation
and
sweettart
watery
grain
not
too
bad
one
of
three
american
lagers
i
can
drink
and
be
happy
go
get
some
its
the
beer
that
made
milwaukee
famous
the
good
land
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
jan1110bo1201900
sampled
on
february
22
2010
it
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
short
burst
of
white
fizzy
head
and
busy
carbonation
there
is
a
little
malty
note
in
the
aroma
along
with
grass
and
weak
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
around
medium
with
a
taste
that
brings
out
a
lightly
sour
flavor
of
grass
and
thin
hops
it
does
have
something
over
the
current
formula
but
it
is
not
significant
notes
maybe
a
little
dry
and
bitter
for
me
in
the
long
run
over
a
session
but
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
carbonation
for
mouthfeel
but
thats
a
minor
complaint
pours
fizzy
yellow
with
about
an
inch
of
head
that
settles
quickly
very
very
clear
i
can
pretty
much
watch
tv
through
the
glass
the
aroma
is
much
sweeter
than
some
other
macrolagers
noticably
maltier
in
taste
than
the
lagers
im
used
to
tasting
not
much
hop
presence
the
taste
is
overall
a
little
more
grainy
sweetness
than
any
type
of
bitterness
a
very
easy
drinker
like
any
adjunct
lager
should
be
a
noticable
step
up
from
a
lot
of
cheap
lagers
but
not
really
heads
and
tails
better
than
a
yeungling
worth
buying
a
six
pack
to
watch
a
football
game
with
schlitz
original
60s
i
had
heard
about
this
and
i
figured
i
would
give
it

try
this
beer

to
look
at

pale

no

nice
hints
of
hops
and
malt
the
taste
was
sweet
with
some
hints
of
hops
very
clean
tasting
mouthfeel
was
good
and
of
course
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
better
then
almost
any
other
macro
that
i
can
think
of
its
a
no
nonsense
easy
drinking
lager
would
be
nice
on
a
summer
day
grilling
out
or
just
watching
a
game
probably
the
biggest
improvement
over
the
current
schlitz
is
the
mouth
feel
the
gusto
feels
richer
and
fuller
not
too
big
just
right
i
can
drink
this
all
night
and
wish
i
bought
more
than
just
a
six
pack
i
wish
the
gusto
was
distributed
in
kentucky
this
brew
would
have
a
regular
place
in
my
fridge
overall
well
worth
a
shot
for
an
adjunct
lager
very
reasonably
priced
and
not
overly
offensive
good
for
bmc
drinkers
looking
for
something
with
a
touch
of
flavor
nice
work
this
beer
is
all
about
nostalgia
it
is
the
taste
i
remember
as
a
kid
and
love
it
today
i
think
most
reviewers
have
stated
it
all
what
i
would
like
to
contribute
is
this
this
beer
is
what
american
lagers
use
to
taste
like
this
is
a
clean
tasting
refreshing
lager
a
good
session
beer
especially
on
hot
lazy
summer
days
the
thing
i
like
the
most
is
this
is
the
beer
i
can
keep
on
hand
for
guests
that
like
beer
but
maybe
not
an
ale
ipa
or
stout
when
they
leave
i
still
have
something
on
hand
that
i
can
enjoy
the
other
macrobrews
feed
my
garden
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
for
the
mostpart
though
the
review
could
lead
you
to
think
otherwise
it
does
have
more
of
a
bite
to
it
compared
to
other
beers
of
this
style
miller
high
life
coors
but
doesnt
stray
too
far
dont
know
if
that
is
for
better
or
worse
drinkability
the
definition
of
drinkable
a
tasty
refreshing
session
beer
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
prefer
it
to
nay
of
the
bmc
brews
out
there
its
got
a
bit
of
merit
all
on
its
own
due
to
its
great
mouthfeel
and
freshclean
flavors
no
off
flavors
on
the
macro
pretty
good
stuff
conclusion
the
bottom
line
is
that
if
im
at
a
bmconly
establishment
ill
order
this
over
the
other
macros
every
time
that
being
said
now
that
its
around
5
99
a
sixer
around
here
and
i
can
get
summit
on
sale
for
a
dollar
more
its
hard
to
make
a
case
for
buying
this
on
any
kind
of
a
regular
basis
though
i
do
miss
the
75
cent
schlitz
happy
hours
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
slight
white
head
smells
like
a
macrooverpowering
sour
with
a
little
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
average
for
a
macro
the
flavor
is
ah
yes
like
college
reminds
me
of
pbr
its
sour
but
at
least
its
cold
i
wasnt
going
to
say
it
was
horrible
but
its
horrible
i
got
it
for
the
novelty
and
thats
about
all
its
good
for
maybe
ill
buy
a
sixer
for
my
dad
or
grandpatheyd
probably
get
a
kick
out
of
it
i
have
always
wondered
what
the
iconic
american
brands
tasted
and
drank
like
back
in
the
day
if
schlitz
was
as
good
then
as
schlitz
gusto
is
now
then
its
even
more
disappointing
how
far
the
asshats
at
ab
miller
and
coors
have
taken
us
down
the
road
of
not
even
mediocrity
but
godforsaken
swillery
this
is
what
an
american
pale
lager
should
taste
like
i
feel
as
though
ive
been
gushing
all
over
this
beer
maybe
i
have
it
is
a
damn
fine
beer
when
i
take
the
style
in
mind
i
havent
come
across
a
better
example
yet
with
that
said
styles
be
damned
i
just
want
my
backyard
beers
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
schlitz
gusto
fits
the
bill
this
will
be
in
the
icebox
often
for
just
such
an
occasion
all
summer
long
whats
left
poured
a
clear
light
yellow
with
no
head
probably
not
even
meant
to
be
drank
from
a
glass
aroma
of
pilsner
malts
light
hops
and
a
champagne
note
light
bodied
mouthfeel
that
is
sweet
with
crisp
carbonation
and
subtle
hop
aftertaste
just
the
kiss
of
the
hops
as
the
commercials
used
to
say
very
good
drinkability
with
not
much
flavor
i
wouldnt
stock
my
fridge
at
home
with
this
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
from
someone
elses
d
its
no
prima
pils
but
its
definitely
head
and
shoulders
above
all
the
other
beers
in
its
price
range
overall
its
far
above
the
typical
watery
overcarbonated
flavorless
macros
that
we
get
today
a
very
good
session
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
and
easy
on
the
palate
i
will
be
drinking
it
again
because
it
offers
a
reasonably
good
quality
at
a
minimal
price
d
a
decent
flavor
with
an
easy
feel
really
drinkable
not
a
real
lager
fan
but
this
schlitz
is
a
very
drinkable
refreshing
beer
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
boulevard
chalice
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
with
just
a
slight
white
head
that
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
corn
crackers
and
just
a
whiff
of
grassy
hops
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
sweet
corn
dominating
the
flavor
profile
biscuits
and
crackers
come
out
from
the
pale
malts
there
is
definitely
a
kiss
of
grassfloral
hops
that
come
out
at
the
very
tail
of
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
sweet
for
the
style
and
doesnt
finish
with
any
of
the
dryness
thats
associated
with
the
american
adjunct
lagers
like
most
decently
done
macros
its
easily
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
i
have
no
problem
with
macro
lagers
when
they
are
decently
well
made
and
gusto
follows
along
those
lines
overall
one
of
the
better
american
macro
lagers
the
grassiness
borders
on
skunkiness
and
does
wear
on
me
a
bit
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
i
can
assume
from
the
packaging
their
60s
formula
is
superior
to
their
2000s
formula
macros
are
always
hard
to
review
compared
to
the
more
flavorful
brews
i
generally
drink
for
the
style
this
is
quite
nice
it
has
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
and
none
of
the
offflavors
often
found
in
the
style
i
probably
wont
sit
and
ponder
the
flavors
of
this
again
but
ill
be
back
to
it
when
choices
are
limited
tastewise
the
hops
play
a
good
role
in
the
flavour
as
well
as
the
nose
sure
the
malt
is
up
front
with
some
corny
tones
and
some
sweetish
tones
but
dag
nab
it
then
some
nice
hop
bitterness
moves
in
and
it
dominates
the
finish
good
aftertaste
from
those
hops
as
well
a
much
better
product
than
the
cans
that
they
have
been
putting
out
all
these
years
and
something
that
i
could
easily
revisit
darn
drinkable
and
darn
tasty
i
like
thanks
for
the
legend
for
the
sample
bottle
12oz
brown
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
brilliant
pale
straw
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
a
bit
of
sulfur
and
corn
in
the
aroma
also
some
noble
hops
sulfur
fades
quickly
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
crisp
with
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
fair
amount
of
noble
hop
bite
light
and
drinkable
im
not
sure
what
all
the
hype
is
about
give
me
a
good
euro
pilsner
or
helles
over
this
any
day
while
its
of
course
not
even
close
to
a
munich
helles
or
something
it
actually
has
some
flavor
that
isnt
bad
like
most
adjunct
lagers
for
the
cheap
price
its
not
bad
at
all
clear
pale
golden
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
thin
collar
smells
of
untoasted
grain
and
grits
with
a
lemon
citrus
hop
note
tastes
like
a
better
version
of
every
macro
lager
ive
ever
had
crisp
and
refreshing
with
soft
lemon
and
hay
flavors
balanced
nicely
with
mild
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
finishes
squeaky
clean
top
of
the
heap
in
this
category
this
is
not
the
greatest
beer
evar111eleventy
but
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
which
is
an
all
malt
american
lager
rock
your
world
hardly
but
it
may
rock
your
summer
cookout
if
youre
gutsy
enough
to
let
it
not
world
class
but
perhaps
top
of
its
class
im
old
enough
to
remember
when
schlitz
was
one
of
if
not
the
best
selling
beers
in
the
usa
go
for
all
the
gusto
you
can
grab
was
the
slogan
i
believe
ad
their
adds
featured
sailors
in
exotic
ports
anyway
more
to
the
point
schlitz
pours
a
nice
strawgolden
color
typical
of
american
lagers
there
is
little
head
and
what
there
is
rapidly
thins
to
a
trace
the
taste
is
mild
and
not
objectionable
the
body
is
thin
there
is
little
in
the
way
of
hop
flavour
or
odor
but
that
is
typical
of
the
style
i
would
say
it
is
a
little
better
than
average
for
this
category
i
keep
some
around
to
have
when
im
in
the
mood
for
an
aal
and
for
cooking
ham
d
very
clean
and
decent
easy
to
nail
a
bunch
of
these
guys
i
normally
cant
stand
to
drink
a
beer
from
the
bottle
but
would
have
no
trouble
with
this
will
buy
again
once
it
gets
hot
in
here
in
st
louis
sometimes
a
guy
just
needs
an
easy
drinking
lower
abv
plain
old
american
macro
style
lager
this
and
pbr
do
it
for
me
blipped
mucho
gusto
by
the
aquabats
perfect
beer
to
ice
down
and
throw
back
a
6pk
or
two
during
those
hot
muggy
summers
in
the
south
if
you
like
hops
like
i
do
then
this
is
the
new
lawn
mower
beer
for
you
drinkability
for
all
its
pluses
i
cant
see
drinking
all
that
many
of
these
maybe
its
all
the
old
timers
telling
me
schlitz
old
formula
gave
a
lot
of
people
head
aches
but
its
one
of
those
beers
that
i
dont
react
well
with
d
a
very
drinkable
session
domestic
beer
please
dont
let
this
one
go
into
hibernation
again
overall
its
really
hard
to
find
any
faults
with
this
beer
while
its
thinner
and
lighter
than
say
a
true
munich
helles
it
shares
many
of
the
same
qualitiesjust
scaled
down
overall
however
id
have
to
say
this
is
exceptional
for
its
style
whereas
i
generally
consider
the
best
macro
lagers
to
simply
be
the
least
offensive
this
is
affirmatively
good
i
would
take
this
hands
down
over
the
typical
macro
swill
available
at
your
corner
tavern
i
really
really
hope
they
start
carrying
this
at
my
local
bowling
alley
dvery
nice
with
food
one
to
savor
of
this
style
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
for
it
but
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
bed
taste
petty
flavorful
and
drinkable
for
an
adjunct
lager
it
seems
more
substantial
than
many
others
of
the
same
style
id
probably
give
it
a
4
out
of
5
on
the
taste
if
it
had
a
bigger
bitter
finish
im
a
craft
beer
and
beer
snob
first
and
foremost
so
understanding
that
i
like
a
hopdevil
or
a
good
rodenbach
is
key
to
the
fact
that
any
good
beer
can
be
balanced
with
the
quintessential
lawnmowerparty
beer
as
for
this
beer
i
give
it
high
marks
because
it
takes
a
lot
to
make
a
beer
that
will
show
imperfections
as
much
as
a
pimple
will
always
rear
its
ugly
head
on
prom
night
this
beer
pours
clean
and
clear
with
a
fine
head
in
the
right
pilsner
glass
i
happen
to
own
a
schlitz
glass
taste
of
malt
and
corn
with
a
lightbodied
finish
not
for
the
hopheads
the
belgian
freaks
or
the
barrelaged
fanatic
this
is
1960
in
a
bottle
ready
for
summer
and
a
stroll
through
suburbia
so
sit
back
and
have
a
brewski
with
the
buds
and
enjoy
dyes
but
not
necessarily
a
slammer
stop
to
enjoy
it
i
get
what
theyre
doing
here
obvious
parallels
in
taste
quality
image
to
high
life
and
that
is
totally
fine
by
me
what
can
u
say
about
schlitz
gusto
the
60s
formula
in
a
bottle
well
if
it
was
good
enough
for
my
late
father
and
grandfather
to
drink
then
i
must
say
its
good
enough
for
me
i
was
excited
when
i
found
out
schlitz
was
going
to
bottle
its
old
formula
and
the
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
at
least
for
me
i
gave
a
couple
of
warm
bottles
of
this
stuff
to
my
neighbor
to
put
in
his
fridge
but
he
couldnt
wait
and
drank
em
warm
and
he
loved
them
i
prefer
to
drink
my
beer
cold
and
its
pleasure
in
every
sip
maybe
im
just
being
nostalgic
but
i
do
like
this
beer
enough
to
give
it
high
marks
across
the
board
its
definitely
not
the
beer
schlitz
brews
in
a
can
i
picked
up
a
12pack
at
delocks
liquors
in
munster
indiana
over
the
christmas
holidays
and
i
plan
on
getting
more
on
my
next
trip
north
it
is
a
cheap
macro
that
is
widely
available
in
the
midwest
for
being
what
it
is
and
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
style
it
is
a
step
above
the
competition
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
taste
that
i
was
not
prepared
for
but
welcomed
great
macro
may
have
to
become
my
go
to
beer
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
grainadjuncts
not
an
offensive
aroma
but
not
exactly
pleasing
either
it
tastes
like
graincorn
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
lemon
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
has
a
clean
finish
and
isnt
watery
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
at
all
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
as
a
summerlawnmower
beer
for
the
style
its
pretty
good
i
think
its
a
good
macroadjunct
lager
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
this
style
of
beer
id
definitely
pick
this
up
its
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
its
certainly
a
step
up
from
most
bmc
beers
of
the
same
style
drinkability
well
gotta
admit
that
i
could
drink
at
least
a
couple
of
these
especially
when
hot
weather
hits
this
really
isnt
too
bad
at
all
definitely
one
of
the
better
macros
ive
had
in
my
opinion
the
best
lawn
mower
beer
ive
found
to
date
no
everyday
lager
from
bmc
this
well
made
however
at
6
50
a
six
pack
i
will
probably
fall
back
to
pbr
its
not
as
good
but
its
good
enough
and
priced
right
the
carbonation
adds
some
nice
mouthfeel
and
the
taste
is
about
what
youd
expect
for
a
good
american
macro
if
this
was
the
only
thing
around
id
not
object
d
this
beer
is
very
soft
and
mellow
with
very
little
flavor
however
there
are
no
off
flavors
that
stand
out
so
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
will
have
to
try
this
one
again
as
a
thirst
quencher
when
it
gets
to
110
degrees
next
summer
pours
much
like
any
bmc
product
with
a
bit
more
of
a
substantial
head
and
a
bit
more
lacing
slightly
corny
mild
hop
kiss
but
otherwise
listless
and
grainy
though
admittedly
a
step
up
from
the
sickening
sweetness
of
most
macros
less
corn
more
cereal
graininess
and
just
the
slightest
kiss
of
fruity
hops
light
bodied
and
fizzy
with
a
crisp
refreshingly
dry
finish
not
really
sure
what
the
bfd
is
about
this
beer
probably
a
pretty
decent
option
for
a
macro
lager
if
sam
adams
or
yuengling
is
not
available
but
really
just
an
average
though
refreshing
macro
lager
ordered
a
bottle
at
palmers
bar
on
cedar
ave
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
appears
a
clear
straw
gold
after
reading
about
this
beer
my
expectations
we
a
little
high
but
its
really
just
a
better
macro
lager
the
corn
element
is
still
present
though
there
is
a
quick
hint
of
hops
in
the
flavor
and
a
mix
of
bready
malts
with
the
vegetable
notes
drinkable
and
certainly
a
decent
macro
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thing
damn
decent
beer
even
if
it
isnt
flashy
or
big
in
body
or
flavors
i
like
the
freshness
it
makes
me
feel
like
i
got
my
dollars
worth
and
i
forget
that
i
am
drinking
cheap
beer
i
also
love
the
marketing
with
the
old
school
label
and
the
60s
looking
posters
i
really
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
brew
that
my
grandfather
might
have
swigged
on
well
done
schlitz
i
am
a
new
fan
d
gusto
more
than
any
other
macro
this
is
a
pretty
damn
fine
drinkable
macro
it
ranks
right
up
there
with
grain
belt
in
my
opinion
will
drink
again
once
i
get
past
the
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
some
malt
or
grain
and
some
hops
not
bad
mouth
feel
is
kind
of
dry
on
the
finish
and
this
beer
is
drinkable
asfar
as
american
macro
lagers
go
this
is
the
best
i
have
had
very
good
and
delisish
could
drink
this
all
day
long
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
half
inch
white
head
some
nice
lacing
too
off
to
a
good
start
the
aroma
is
small
but
can
pick
up
traces
of
crackers
hops
a
bit
buttery
and
clean
nothing
great
but
doesnt
detract
the
taste
is
solid
crisp
and
clean
pale
malt
some
crackers
and
a
nice
amount
of
hops
here
make
the
taste
above
average
for
the
style
with
a
solid
body
light
carbonation
and
pretty
smooth
in
all
pretty
darn
good
for
a
style
i
loath
wouldnt
mind
tipping
back
a
few
of
these
surprisingly
good
easily
the
best
macrostyle
lager
ive
ever
had
id
take
this
over
bmc
any
day
and
it
even
eclipses
high
life
and
grain
belt
my
son
just
bought
me
a
12
pack
of
the
old
60s
formula
schlitz
i
drank
schlitz
back
then
as
a
kid
and
in
the
army
and
its
every
bit
as
good
now
as
then
at
one
time
schlitz
was
the
best
selling
brand
in
the
u
s
next
to
bud
great
taste
for
a
non
dark
beer
id
take
this
over
any
of
its
macro
peers
in
a
heartbeat
it
makes
me
want
to
stay
up
all
night
play
poker
and
smoke
cheap
cigars
and
i
think
thats
exactly
the
point
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
the
1960s
formula
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
straw
color
with
a
quickly
diminishing
white
head
the
aroma
is
mediumlow
graininess
a
bit
of
corn
and
a
hint
of
spicy
hop
the
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
a
little
musty
malt
a
bit
of
corn
and
low
hop
bitterness
the
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
but
beer
is
still
rather
smooth
the
beer
finishes
clean
with
just
a
bit
of
lingering
malty
sweetness
overall
a
well
done
example
of
the
style
easy
drinking
but
with
more
flavor
than
most
examples
at
4
99
a
six
pack
worth
picking
up
maybe
even
go
for
the
12
pack
drinkablity
nice
quality
very
drinkable
and
easygoing
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
pale
malt
floral
hops
and
just
a
hint
of
yeast
flavor
is
pilsner
malt
light
fruit
and
light
hops
light
bodied
somewhat
sticky
texture
long
sweet
finish
really
quite
a
few
steps
above
any
other
mass
produced
pale
lager
available
this
might
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
they
pretty
much
hit
the
mark
with
bringing
back
this
recipe
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
reformulated
version
but
this
version
seems
far
less
bitter
from
what
i
recall
i
would
probably
have
to
drink
the
two
recipes
side
by
side
to
really
break
the
differences
down
but
i
like
this
newold
recipe
i
honestly
dont
think
a
macro
lager
can
get
any
better
than
this
true
its
no
two
hearted
or
arrogant
bastard
but
for
what
its
going
for
its
fantastic
very
light
beer
even
fresh
i
got
notes
of
lightstruck
almost
no
smell
and
almost
no
flavour
less
flavour
than
a
mexican
light
beer
overall
quilmes
is
a
beer
that
can
be
appreciated
with
heavy
meals
in
warm
climates
just
really
uninspiring
shit
the
sole
resemption
lies
in
that
if
youre
swilling
this
its
probably
3
in
the
morning
youre
probably
outdoors
and
youre
likely
surrounded
by
the
worlds
most
breathtakingly
gorgeous
humans
vive
argentina
refreshing
adjunct
lager
not
bad
when
cold
and
even
though
it
does
not
have
a
character
on
its
own
it
is
a
bit
above
local
average
cheap
adjunct
lagers
its
relative
bitterness
a
tick
above
average
partially
offsets
its
sweet
corn
notes
there
is
a
bitter
aftertaste
which
grows
on
you
it
certainly
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
light
and
good
for
a
session
esay
and
light
drink
good
for
summer
time
pours
a
straw
pale
yellow
with
a
medium
lasting
white
head
moderate
lacing
aroma
and
taste
is
of
grains
hay
with
light
malt
notes
and
maize
a
light
to
medium
body
and
mild
carbonation
on
the
palate
finish
is
sweet
mild
grains
and
grassy
flavors
and
light
fruity
notes
overall
a
somewhat
muted
and
bland
brew
but
ok
for
a
hot
summer
day
71100
when
i
taste
this
beer
it
takes
me
back
to
my
culture
and
heritage
crisp
yes
moderately
clean
and
even
with
some
smoothness
to
it
this
beer
is
just
unoffensive
all
the
way
around
if
you
have
your
choice
of
paleadjunct
lagers
this
will
be
better
than
many
of
your
other
albeit
limited
options
the
appearance
isnt
anything
out
of
this
world
neither
is
the
smell
but
the
taste
is
amazing
very
smooth
and
no
nasty
after
taste
great
for
on
the
beach
or
at
home
give
it
a
shot
o
welp
i
just
ticked
argentina
granted
the
tick
was
just
another
lame
macro
lager
but
who
cares
i
ticked
a
country
i
never
thought
i
would
be
able
to
relatively
soon
id
never
want
to
drink
this
again
though
even
among
similar
aals
it
blows
chunks
o
watery
and
cold
at
best
i
find
quilmes
a
great
beer
even
though
it
is
mass
produced
and
distributed
it
pours
light
golden
with
little
fizzle
bubbles
and
mediumaverage
head
it
has
a
hoppy
taste
with
hints
of
tropical
fruits
citric
and
rice
it
drinks
smooth
with
a
mild
edge
and
mild
aftertaste
it
leaves
the
plate
refreshed
and
wanting
more
it
is
widely
sold
in
the
united
states
clean
and
worked
fine
with
a
meal
but
no
legs
to
stand
on
its
own
refreshing
drinkable
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
really
o
drinkable
and
ok
with
a
burger
but
very
forgettable
not
enjoyable
o
ill
remember
this
beer
better
than
what
this
bottle
offered
having
a
chop
with
a
big
steak
is
unbeatable
overall
a
decent
lager
but
im
a
little
perplexed
by
the
price
of
au55
60
per
case
of
24
2013
seems
a
bit
steep
for
what
is
advertised
as
argentinas
most
prevalent
beer
i
e
new
vb
etc
certainly
not
worth
the
price
until
someone
realises
that
a
standard
cheap
lager
should
be
cheap
o
not
a
bad
pale
lager
with
it
had
a
bi
t
of
crispness
to
offset
the
lingering
sweetness
another
crappy
macro
lager
though
it
tilts
at
the
low
end
of
the
quality
scale
you
can
taste
the
corn
straight
away
fresh
out
of
the
fridge
it
looks
alright
and
thats
about
all
its
got
going
for
it
aroma
and
flavour
are
weak
and
beset
by
unpleasant
offnotes
watery
body
not
good
and
not
recommended
avoid
o
interesting
lager
went
down
smooth
just
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
it
goes
very
well
with
chicken
or
fish
has
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
not
too
sweet
and
the
hops
dont
overwhelm
your
palate
a
really
nice
back
porch
in
the
summer
brew
this
beer
compares
more
than
favorably
to
a
corona
for
example
but
it
will
never
be
mistaken
for
a
craft
beer
and
it
shouldnt
its
an
everyday
beer
and
it
kills
american
lagers
such
as
bud
coors
etc
it
has
a
decent
head
and
is
a
bit
thin
that
said
for
this
style
of
beer
it
rates
highly
for
me
o
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
very
pleasant
smell
or
taste
both
of
which
seem
bland
other
than
being
relatively
easy
to
drink
the
only
notable
aspect
about
this
beer
is
that
the
mouthfeel
isnt
that
bad
and
it
doesnt
taste
watery
poured
into
a
small
pilsner
glass
pours
pale
golden
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
a
little
slower
than
the
typical
adjunct
lager
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
present
in
this
beer
as
made
evident
by
abundant
streaming
bubbles
rising
in
this
beer
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
theres
a
touch
of
grassiness
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
grainy
and
bready
with
some
sweetness
the
hops
do
provide
some
mild
flavor
thats
a
little
grassy
theres
not
much
back
end
hop
bitterness
the
body
is
light
with
strong
carbonation
the
beer
finishes
crisp
and
clean
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
is
a
very
good
beer
overall

this
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
straw
color
with
a
small
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
are
sweet
full
of
adjuncts
no
hops
the
feel
is
light
the
taste
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
but
better
than
the
american
light
counter
parts
you
get
some
light
grass
light
hops

slightly
gassy
with

saltines

flavorful
though
clean
with
no

the
palate
nicely
when
paired
with
food
in
this
case
argentine
empanadas
from
buenos

deli
pours
a
clear
golden
with
foamy
head
malty
sweet
aromas
but
an
actual
hop
smell
it
almost
smells
like
it
was
dry
hopped
taste
is
not
bad
a
definite
malt
flavor
but
an
almost
sweet
hop
and
crisp
taste
its
way
diferent
than
an
american
adjunct
its
really
unique
in
the
adjunct
style
worth
a
try
just
because
its
a
bit
diff
than
most
of
the
style

weekend
thanks
to

pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
in
the
july
sun
smells
malty
sweet
and
lightly
grainy
with
the
faintest
of
floral
hops
to
provide
a
hint
of
balance
the
flavor
is
what
i
expected
a
bit
sweet
hints
of
honey
almost
no
hop
flavor
medium

a
moderate
level

a

along
with
an

flair
its
medium
light
bodied
with
tiny
but
aggressive
carbonation
fortunately
theres
no
metal
in

flavor
and
it
mellows
into
a
decent
grain
refreshment
this
is
another
beer
du

for
a

cuisine
i
guess
every
country
must
have
one
or
two
budweiser
beers
to
bring
to
the

restaurants
of
the
world
this
was
my
first

it

i
think
the
best
way
to
put
it
is
that
this
may
be
the
argentinian
version
of
bud
lite
drinkable
low
alcohol
beer
d
really
not
a
bad
little
lager
id
much
rather
drink
this
than
bud
or
coors
or
miller
overall
better
than
most
latin
american
lagers
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
not
a
very
impressive
beer
pours
very
clear
with
a
small
nice
white
head
smells
like
corn
and
malt
tastes
like
it
well
like
most
major
american
beers
watered
down
overall
it
does
seem
to
be
a
great
summer
beer
if
weather
was
right
and
it
was
cold
enough
there
is
a
light
malty
hoppy
taste
in
it
that
reminds
me
that
i
am
drinking
a
beer
not
something
that
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
to
get
or
even
get
again
overall
a
full
bodied
adjunct
lager
not
as
easy
to
drink
as
most
this
beer
is
a
small
step
up
from
the
usual
macro
fare
i
bought
a
six
pack
but
was
glad
when
it
was
all
gone
not
a
beer
ill
be
spending
money
on
again

tastes
of

nothing

about
it
just
a

of
the
style
grassy
with
a
light
bitterness
wouldnt
drink
this
if
i
were
in
argentina
the
local
beer
is
bound
to
be
better
d
not
that
pleasant
no
better
than
any
number
of
mediocre
beers
of
this
type
the
mineral
flavors
in
the
middle
were
this
beers
one
way
of
standing
out
unfortunately
those
flavors
were
unpleasant
i
guess
this
would
be
an
ok
summer
quencher
if
served
ice
cold
ill
pass
drinkability
also
like
the
mass
markets
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
all
day
long
and
with
the
low
alcohol
content
and
the
afternoon
siesta
nothing
is
stopping
you
brown
bottle
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
slightly
dark
golden
color
and
a
fairly
weak
aroma
it
has
a
good
but
not
very
strong
flavor
with
no
aftertaste
somewhat
watery
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
good
especially
in
warmer
weather
a
decent
but
not
great
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pale
yellowgolden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
faintly
of
grain
maybe
a
little
grassy
aroma
as
well
tastes
very
dry
with
a
slightly
metallic
finish
faint
grainy
malts
dominate
the
palate
theres
just
not
a
lot
too
this
beer
its
pretty
inoffensive
but
not
all
that
interesting
drinks
fairly
easy
but
i
cant
say
i
was
itching
to
have
another
one
after
this
especially
at
import
prices
hey
its
not
bad
but
neither
is
it
huge
or
spectacular
pretty
drinkable
though
drinkability
as
drinkable
as
water
mouthfeel
is
painfully
thin
drinkable
yeah
well
waters
drinkable
confuckulations
d
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
import
is
the
closest
in
style
to
the
american
macros
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
its
price
was
on
par
with
much
of
the
bmc
at
the
bottle
shop
so
its
got
that
going
for
it
that
and
its
pretty
refreshing
on
a
warm
evening
overall
like
i
said
if
everyone
is
drinking
it
and
it
is
so
cheap
why
not
this
is
a
great
import
beer
not
too
heavy
of
a
taste
but
the
elements
that
are
there
are
tied
together
nicely
and
make
a
delicious
beer
it
is
extremely
easy
drinking
and
would
go
down
smooth
and
refreshing
on
a
summer
day
from
the
moment
i
cracked
this
bottle
i
was
in
love
what
a
good
buy
i
tried
it
a
few
more
times
and
i
still
loved
it
i
know
there
isnt
much
going
on
with
this
beer
but
this
is
my
opinion
and
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
macro
beer
i
would
drink
this
over
sam
adams
light
any
day
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
that
give
this
beer
a
second
try
if
you
get
the
chance
and
really
examine
it
this
time
the
taste
is
corn
and
bread
with
a
nice
malt
back
not
too
bad
if
you
expect
nothing
but
busch
light
with
a
touch
of
presidente
quilmes
feels
clean
crisp
and
not
overly
carbonated
it
says
something
about
a
beer
if
you
can
drink
two
of
them
after
playing
basketball
for
two
hours
and
find
them
as
refreshing
as
gatorade
right
well
i
for
one
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
for
my
money
its
the
best
mass
market
south
of
the
border
beer
there
is
only
bohemia
mexico
and
belikin
belize
come
close
as
such
this
beer
gets
the
highest
possible
marks
for
drinkability
so
long
as
it
is
taken
for
what
it
is
this
is
the
two
and
half
men
of
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
light
blonde
in
color
completely
translucent
with
ample
carbonation
no
head
really
just
a
very
thin
sheet
of
white
fizz
nose
is
grains
and
grains
not
much
else
beer
is
watery
with
mild
bread
taste
about
what
i
expected
which
doesnt
make
it
good
however
if
you
want
something
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
will
work
drinkability
if
you
can
drink
water
you
can
drink
this
beer
notes
well
i
think
the
only
other
adjunct
ive
had
was
a
leinie
so
in
that
context
and
being
from
argentina
not
a
bad
job
i
guess
i
know
that
i
reviewed
this
here
years
ago
and
its
gone
eh
appears
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
bright
white
head
forms
thick
with
large
bubbles
and
a
thin
lacing
forms
spradically
with
each
methocdical
sip
aroamtics
offer
up
light
cereal
notes
light
cooked
veggies
and
a
mild
sweet
sugar
coated
pastry
flavor
provides
creamy
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
lemon
grass
in
the
finish
very
thirst
quenching
offering
along
with
the
cooked
veggies
and
creamy
corn
accents
definitely
not
overbearing
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
spritzy
natured
carbonation
bringling
clean
finished
with
no
residuals
noted
easily
unchallenging
to
the
senses
much
like
co2
the
watery
texture
adds
to
the
unrefined
and
non
complex
finish
drinkability
is
overall
very
enjoyable
but
it
definitely
is
not
remarkable
a
beer
i
dould
reach
for
on
a
sunny
day
to
quench
my
thirst
but
thats
about
it
pours
translucent
gold
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
retain
well
aromas
of
malt
and
corn
simple
on
the
palate
this
bear
is
watery
with
an
almost
artificial
malt
sweetness
with
more
corn
and
rather
thin
bodied
easy
drinking
almost
no
hops
but
certainly
would
prefer
this
over
any
bmc
offering
at
the
office
party
with
limited
selections
drinkable
pretty
much
year
round
in
texas
easily
a
session
beer
not
much
flavour
but
what
are
you
comparing
it
to
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
mass
produced
budweiser
coors
and
miller
this
would
get
the
nod
a
bit
of
a
corn
kinda
feel
to
it
like
presidente
from
dominican
republic
if
i
remember
right
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
decently
frothy
white
head
now
thats
an
unpleasant
nose
if
you
ask
me
stankin
corny
roasted
malt
sweaty
stale
metallic
machinelike
funk
corn
flakes
and
a
biscuit
like
sweetness
going
on
i
get
limes
initially
on
the
tongue
grassy
and
floral
this
beers
got
some
hop
character
to
it
even
if
its
not
such
a
pleasant
one
tingly
in
the
mouth
a
bit
too
over
carbonated
in
turn
making
what
little
malt
character
this
beer
has
drop
right
off
the
face
of
the
earth
mid
palate
the
after
taste
is
nothing
but
whiffs
at
bitterness
i
guess
this
would
be
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
im
not
going
to
stick
around
to
find
out
easy
to
drink
adjunct
larger
a
very
standard
example
of
the
style
not
much
of
any
smell
excepting
a
slight
super
sweet
malty
rice
smell
pours
to
a
pale
yellow
with
a
big
bubble
head
that
recedes
fast
but
stays
on
the
surface
taste
is
sweet
with
hopping
only
in
the
far
background
at
the
start
then
coming
towards
the
front
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
very
good
smooth
with
no
overpowering
carbonation
overall
too
sweet
for
me
if
this
is
argentinas
favorite
beer
as
stated
on
the
bottle
i
think
they
know
alot
about
wine
but
are
painfully
ignorant
when
it
comes
to
beer
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
beer
sampler
pack
and
this
was
the
argentinian
choice
i
guess
as
a
lawnmower
beer
it
could
work
but
my
advice
drink
this
one
cold
and
fast
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
lager
poured
into
a
pint
glass
same
old
pale
lager
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
no
lacing
aroma
is
corn
syrupy
sweet
with
little
grain
corn
syrup
flavored
mineral
water
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
blech
this
is
almost
cheap
malt
liquor
bad
no
coincidence
that
the
name
is
almost
kill
me
ok
lager
taste
but
nothing
stood
out
and
grabbed
me
with
this
beer
the
4
9
wasnt
to
be
found
either
it
wasnt
wishywashy
but
it
wasnt
a
full
bodied
little
babe
you
could
cuddle
up
too
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
but
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
ok
no
big
imperfections
that
tend
to
stick
ouot
in
this
style
just
nothing
special
i
hope
there
are
craft
brewers
in
argentina
the
taste
also
is
light
but
thoroughly
pleasant
with
a
hint
of
complexity
but
it
is
lighter
than
the
aroma
it
has
light
grain
lemon
7up
and
herbal
hoppy
bitterness
that
is
light
but
persistent
and
just
dominates
the
finish
its
clean
crisp
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
main
problem
is
that
the
taste
is
too
light
and
thin
which
is
too
bad
because
what
i
can
taste
is
good
drinkability
shamefully
watery
great
for
rinsing
out
your
glass
for
the
next
beer
hopefully
one
with
some
actual
flavor
and
character
watery
and
awful
drain
pour
pours
a
very
light
pale
color
with
a
small
almost
non
existent
head
smells
of
corn
and
not
much
malt
first
sip
is
tad
bitter
with
an
ok
hop
presence
but
not
much
flavor
very
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
very
typical
for
beers
from
south
america
not
enough
flavor
to
be
called
a
beer
a
330
cc
bottle
of
quilmes
cristal
cerveza
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
the
bottle
was
a
little
warmer
than
ice
cold
which
turned
out
to
be
unfortunate
a
bad
malty
and
unpleasant
palate
with
a
corn
background
probably
would
have
been
better
if
it
was
colder
but
as
is
i
didnt
enjoy
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
fizzy
yellow
beer
mouthfeel
as
it
should
be
carbonation
is
high
and
scrubs
the
palate
as
afore
mentioned
it
finishes
dry
this
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
is
in
fact
one
of
the
better
macros
ive
drank
on
the
other
hand
this
isnt
one
that
id
buy
again
for
9
99
a
sixer
its
overpriced
for
what
youre
getting
it
is
better
than
the
majority
of
macros
but
not
so
much
better
as
to
offset
the
price
a
nice
one
to
try
if
you
want
to
see
what
a
pretty
decent
macro
is
like
but
overall
not
worth
the
repeated
buy
macros
have
their
place
though
they
all
taste
so
similar
that
one
can
easily
be
substituted
for
the
other
especially
with
food
pairings
or
the
after
the
lawn
beer
this
one
is
too
much
money
for
pretty
much
the
same
product
im
torn
on
the
drinkability
of
this
one
because
it
is
a
higher
end
macro
but
on
the
other
side
it
is
overpriced
as
well
certainly
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
its
a
plain
kind
of
lager
but
no
major
defects
in
execution
so
that
alone
beats
a
lot
of
macros
still
its
mostly
uninteresting
in
the
taste
department
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
argentina
i
wont
turn
this
down
as
a
thirst
quencher
but
i
wont
be
seeking
out
much
otherwise
d
i
could
put
down
a
ton
of
these
but
i
really
wouldnt
want
to
it
is
however
better
than
most
of
the
macro
lagers
out
there
besides
bud
this
one
reminds
me
of
red
stripe
as
well
have
to
wonder
about
the
commonality
of
their
brewing
processes
overall
this
was
a
suprise
from
argentina
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
one
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
but
i
did
not
have
my
hopes
up
for
this
one
over
all
a
good
feel
in
a
beer
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
if
they
offered
it
in
oklahoma
but
i
bought
it
in
austin
drinkability
bad
id
sell
this
to
minors
to
teach
them
that
underage
drinking
is
wrong
d
gets
a
bit
more
bitter
and
metal
as
you
drink
starts
out
really
good
though
im
not
mad
at
myself
for
buying
it
drinkability
is
utterly
worthless
i
had
absolutely
no
desire
whatsoever
to
finish
this
beer
no
reason
to
drink
this
im
not
sure
if
i
can
think
of
another
beer
id
drink
less
than
this
i
would
even
drink
michelob
ultra
before
this
or
just
plain
water
avoid
i
will
an
acceptable
beer
but
has
absolutely
nothing
in
the
flavour
department
md
very
dry
and
not
very
smooth
as
it
goes
down
it
is
very
watered
down
and
not
very
flavorful
nothing
more
to
report
on
this
end
this
would
be
a
beer
that
the
average
person
would
enjoy
mouthfeel
is
pretty
clean
and
crisp
tight
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
drink
would
be
even
better
in
a
cafe
in
buenos
aries
light
yellow
watery
color
with
medium
lasting
white
head
smell
is
malty
and
yeasty
became
stronger
as
it
warmed
taste
is
light
flavored
and
bodied
with
a
malt
biscuity
yeasty
flavor
a
touch
doughy
flavored
for
me
but
drinkable
when
cold
nothing
special
here
argentina
is
pretty
hot
right
well
this
would
be
quite
refreshing
in
the
heat
but
so
would
a
cool
glass
of
water
i
wouldnt
turn
this
beer
down
but
there
really
is
very
little
to
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
goes
down
smooth
enough
since
its
so
watered
down
perhaps
tolerable
on
a
very
hot
day
even
then
theres
much
much
better
to
choose
from
overall
not
impressive
a
decent
beer
considering
its
classmates
id
certainly
try
one
over
brahma
if
in
sa
but
i
wount
be
running
to
my
preferred
beer
store
begging
him
to
stock
this
one
either
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
good
sized
white
head
but
it
falls
very
fast
nose
is
typical
but
no
skunky
attributes
or
metallic
tones
at
all
slight
earthy
tone
going
on
flavor
is
very
uneventful
just
typical
macro
lager
style
minimal
flavor
impact
still
though
it
isnt
total
garbage
feel
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
on
it
typical
liquid
feel
drinkable
sure
it
is
what
it
is
i
am
sure
it
would
be
even
better
if
i
was
stuck
somewhere
in
argentina
and
no
duvel
was
to
be
found
anywhere
decent
enough
to
try
but
no
great
shakes
here
way
better
than
most
macro
crap
though
would
not
drink
this
again
or
recommend
this
beer
unless
you
are
just
curious
to
try
a
cheap
beer
that
you
never
heard
of
like
i
did
d
not
too
bad
but
not
too
good
just
another
run
of
the
mill
import
lager
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
creamy
white
head
that
fades
away
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
thin
layer
on
top
smells
a
little
yeasty
and
vaguely
hoppy
the
taste
is
very
clean
but
fairly
well
balanced
im
not
tasting
any
malt
though
just
some
nondescript
sweetness
and
just
enuff
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
tingly
with
some
carbonation
burn
on
the
tongue
and
otherwise
pretty
light
and
airy
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
probably
real
nice
on
a
hot
day
while
not
a
great
beer
this
was
not
actually
too
bad
especially
for
a
south
american
beer
quilmes
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
theres
not
much
to
the
aroma
some
grainyness
the
taste
is
grainy
a
bit
grassy
maybe
even
a
bit
hoppy
nothing
special
but
on
the
other
hand
a
respectable
beer
for
a
latin
american
brewery
worth
a
try
not
interested
in
having
again
but
not
substantially
better
or
worse
than
a
lot
of
other
macro
lagers
and
a
better
body
than
some
pass
drinkability
alright
in
a
pinch
it
is
good
cold
and
some
what
refreshing
relax
and
enjoy
life
overall
made
for
the
masses
too
watery
and
boring
to
justify
a
second
try
overall
this
is
a
pretty
standard
american
lager
its
not
horrible
but
not
really
remarkable
just
kind
of
there
i
perceive
a
certain
amount
of
malt
adjuncts
that
make
it
somewhat
unappealing
to
my
palate
and
while
this
is
indicative
of
the
style
it
should
not
be
the
most
notable
characteristic
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
might
expect
to
be
popular
light
fizzy
crisp
and
quaffable
although
corn
is
detectable
there
are
no
major
offflavors
in
this
brew
the
result
is
a
semisweet
beer
with
a
slap
of
crisp
bitterness
on
the
tongue
a
decent
imported
brew
that
i
could
suck
on
for
awhile
this
goes
for
5
69
a
sixer
at
the
local
bevmo
i
could
drink
it
for
awhile
but
one
sample
from
the
travelers
pack
will
do
me
just
fine
drinks
alright
despite
all
the
weird
things
going
on
here
im
sure
this
is
better
if
tried
closer
to
the
source
fresher
id
still
take
this
over
bmc
any
day
overall
not
bad
but
really
not
too
good
it
isnt
offensive
but
i
would
have
liked
more
of
a
crispness
to
it
which
it
did
not
have
this
one
seemed
boring
to
me
even
for
an
american
macro
lager
the
finish
is
very
clean
with
very
little
flavor
beforehand
at
least
other
maco
lagers
have
a
little
more
character
to
them
than
this
perhaps
on
a
very
hot
day
by
the
beach
but
i
really
disagree
with
the
overall
rating
it
is
not
worth
a
try
drinkability
not
an
import
id
buy
when
there
are
so
many
lowbudget
similar
tasting
alternatives
in
the
macro
market
a
lawn
mower
beer
at
best
not
a
bad
thing
necessarily
drinkability
is
good
since
it
is
smooth
enough
to
down
a
few
after
work
without
much
strain
d
not
too
much
too
my
liking
but
did
have
some
positive
characteristics
taste
wasnt
up
my
alley
nothing
really
negative
to
say
about
this
beer
besides
its
not
really
anything
for
me
this
is
not
good
beer
even
for
the
style
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
this
because
i
never
had
beer
from
argentina
i
wasnt
missing
anything
in
this
case
save
this
one
for
the
macrodrinkers
the
flavor
is
nothing
to
rave
about
but
im
surprised
that
this
brew
could
offend
anyone
its
a
pleasant
light
bodied
lager
nothing
to
dislike
the
light
malt
body
offers
some
tastes
of
herbal
malt
grain
with
a
dose
of
sugary
sweetness
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
hoppy
any
kind
bitterness
but
it
is
what
it
is
salud
this
is
what
you
might
expect
as
an
argentinian
export
it
is
a
pale
lager
it
has
slight
malt
flavor
and
is
effervescent
it
has
little
hop
flavor
and
is
drinkable
in
small
quantities
or
more
if
you
want
to
become
bloated
the
color
is
suitable
for
the
style
and
is
formidible
with
little
aroma
and
light
body
a
pale
yellow
color
a
slight
white
head
forms
and
disappears
quickly
really
really
really
quickly
no
real
aroma
slight
scents
of
hoppiness
but
very
faint
the
taste
is
nada
zilch
a
goose
egg
totally
nonexistant
taste
the
feel
is
thinner
than
water
enough
said
this
beer
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
period
pours
with
a
three
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
no
lace
chrystal
clear
light
amber
color
very
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
hoppy

starts
slightly
hoppy
with

has
a
slight
bitterness
another
one
just
for
the
country
12
oz
bottle
part
of
mixed
6pak
for
7
99
from
friar
tucks
peoria
il
quilmes
was
something
of
a
surprise
i
know
itll
never
happen
but
bmc
should
take
a
few
cues
from
some
of
the
better
world
beer
that
makes
it
our
shores
this
argentinian
product
would
be
a
great
place
to
start
i
kind
of
feel
silly
now
after
having
written
such
a
rambling
explanation
about
why
i
bothered
to
try
this
beer
in
spite
of
its
rather
poor
ratings
seriously
this
aint
bad
in
the
least
argentines
need
to
step
up
in
my
opinion
theyve
got
some
upandcoming
wines
so
why
dont
they
have
a
good
beer
to
match
theres
enough
german
immigrants
there
to
help
get
the
brews
going
the
beer
pours
a
rich
golden
with
a
light
head
there
is
a
light
smell
the
taste
was
crisp
and
refreshing
but
it
had
a
tiny
after
taste
the
beer
is
light
and
does
not
linger
in
your
mouth
over
all
its
drinkable
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
a
bottle
overall
i
thought
a
slightly
better
than
usual
macro
lager
and
whilst
not
reaching
great
heights
stands
as
a
satisfactory
beer
is
smooth
in
taste
not
like
water
but
is
indeed
very
light
this
beer
poured
a
light
yellow
carried
a
half
inch
pure
white
head
that
left
lacing
along
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
though
i
know
that
this
is
a
macro
i
found
it
a
cut
above
the
american
macros
unlike
american
macros
this
beer
still
resembled
a
pilsner
which
all
macros
purport
to
be
dont
believe
the
bad
rankings
though
by
no
means
the
best
beer
around
this
is
about
as
enjoyable
as
a
macro
can
get
the
quilmes
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
about
an
inch
fizzy
head
it
smells
mainly
like
adjuncts
and
theres
also
a
slightly
metallic
smell
weird
considering
its
a
bottled
beer
theres
a
sweet
grainy
taste
to
the
beer
pretty
much
the
same
taste
as
most
macros
out
there
however
its
light
bodied
and
nonoffensive
and
it
goes
down
really
really
easy
its
appropriate
that
im
drinking
this
out
of
a
budweiser
glass
because
thats
what
quilmes
reminds
me
of
on
a
hot
day
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
but
theres
many
other
beers
out
there
id
rather
drink
if
youre
a
fan
of
macro
beers
then
quilmes
is
as
good
of
a
choice
as
any
out
there
the
pour
is
a
medium
gold
so
its
darker
than
bmc
barely
the
white
head
lasts
through
the
first
half
of
the
glass
before
fade
to
a
thin
ring
i
can
hardly
pick
out
any
aromas
from
the
faint
nose
maybe
sweet
malts
and
corn
the
flavor
is
crisp
clean
and
very
weak
but
at
least
its
not
offensive
this
is
hardly
a
beer
to
accompany
argentinas
meaty
cuisine
eric
clear
gold
color
smell
is
herbal
grassy
skunkiness
very
subdued
however
you
can
smell
some
adjuncts
like
corn
too
but
it
isnt
too
bad
the
taste
is
just
a
basic
gold
colored
beercertainly
more
flavor
than
our
own
bud
and
this
is
likely
the
bud
of
argentina
for
the
style
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
quite
swillish
but
i
still
think
its
decent
note
ba
indicates
this
is
a
6
5
abv
beer
if
that
were
true
it
would
make
this
beer
a
little
more
worth
drinking
unfortunately
the
label
reveals
that
the
abv
is
in
fact
4
9
drinkable
but
nothing
special
bought
a
six
pack
of
these
in
mexico
for
17
pesos
about
1
50usd
what
a
dea
so
i
was
not
expecting
much
here
for
the
price
this
is
not
bad
crisp
light
malt
aroma
where
is
the
aroma
watery
with
some
noticable
hops
clean
but
bland
some
lacing
noted
there
is
just
very
little
here
the
flavor
is
just
as
bland
with
perhaps
a
vague
grainy
sweetness
with
a
light
bitter
aftertaste
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
due
to
its
watery
character
better
than
a
bud
flavor
is
not
much
better
grainy
sweet
with
a
light
bitter
finish
better
than
bmc
but
not
by
much
well
another
good
lager
beer
for
hot
days
it
is
not
that
great
but
is
good
for
refreshing
very
crystal
and
light
yellow
although
i
got
i
a
little
frozen
is
the
most
comercial
beer
in
argentina
and
there
is
even
a
football
team
with
that
name
and
a
lot
fo
teams
has
the
quilmes
name
in
the
tshirts
sorry
for
the
belived
most
handsome
peoples
inthe
word
they
have
the
worst
beer
sell
in
mexico
its
remarked
grains
flavor
made
worst
its
patagonian
hops
not
help
its
flavor
but
in
general
is
good
only
one
or
two
no
more
they
give
a
several
head
pain
and
cruda
as
ive
said
before
one
of
the
hazards
of
country
collection
is
knowing
that
90
of
the
countries
are
going
to
feature
the
same
boring
adjunct
lager
as
their
national
beer
so
im
not
surprised
about
quilmes
if
i
ever
went
to
argentina
this
might
be
worth
having
in
the
spirit
of
when
in
rome
but
here
in
the
us
this
is
another
one
i
wouldnt
bother
with
again
ill
avoid
this
one
as
long
as
i
can
argentinas
favorite
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
strawgold
body
beneath
a
short
head
of
bright
white
foam
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
nice
splashes
of
spotty
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
displays
lightly
sweetish
adjunct
enhanced
malt
and
just
the
barest
essence
of
grassy
hops
in
the
mouth
its
crisp
with
a
slightly
elevated
carbonation
2
572
6
and
medium
light
body
the
flavor
displays
more
hops
than
the
nose
suggests
but
its
still
very
basic
surprisingly
theres
a
touch
more
hop
bitterness
than
might
be
expected
and
it
finishes
dry
with
some
quickly
fading
sweet
malt
absolutely
tasteless
anonimous
and
completely
useless
the
beer
after
its
decapitation
sets
in
the
glass
a
limpid
light
gold
with
a
modest
bright
white
head
that
is
frothy
in
texture
and
quite
short
lived
the
lace
left
behind
a
velum
like
sheet
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
as
expected
malt
crisp
and
clean
start
somewhat
sweet
and
lightly
malted
top
thin
as
water
finish
is
moderately
carbonated
the
hops
light
but
present
dry
aftertaste
id
pick
this
brew
of
the
pampas
over
the
legion
of
light
mexicans
with
spicy
food
and
if
this
is
the
budweiser
of
argentina
it
is
a
better
bud
all
relative
i
guess
sampled
at
the
southside
beer
expo
frankfort
il
well
i
may
be
sampling
this
just
so
i
can
finally
claim
to
have
had
a
south
american
beer
but
this
does
have
a
little
more
character
than
the
standard
pale
ale
served
a
little
warm
it
demonstrates
a
bit
more
hoppiness
and
a
few
good
malt
notes
than
the
standard
megabrew
just
not
too
much
more
insert
your
joke
about
argentinians
and
germans
here
i
long
ignored
this
beer
figuring
its
lack
of
positive
reputation
said
enough
my
wife
brought
one
home
so
i
had
to
try
it
it
pours
the
same
pale
yellow
as
the
bulk
of
massproduced
american
lagers
it
also
has
the
decidedly
nondescript
smell
of
most
massproduced
american
lagers
the
most
noticeable
smell
is
a
grassy
aroma
hops
are
lurking
far
offstage
somewhere
the
taste
just
like
a
massproduced
american
lager
again
a
grassy
flavor
and
also
some
metallic
taste
its
not
quite
bad
enough
for
a
drainpour
but
its
close
12oz
bottle
i
saw
this
and
decided
to
try
a
beer
from
a
country
that
i
had
not
yet
sampled
one
of
their
beers
it
pours
into
the
glass
a
plae
yellow
color
and
is
pretty
clear
a
big
white
head
that
fizzes
down
rapidly
there
is
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
to
the
beer
there
is
a
sweetness
to
the
nose
but
it
is
mostly
just
sweet
with
a
general
lack
of
character
maybe
a
hint
of
honey
the
taste
is
definitely
light
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sweetness
to
the
taste
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
incredibly
nondescript
and
forgettable
looking
for
something
new
and
interesting
from
a
country
i
have
not
sampled
i
found
this
at
the
local
pub
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
fell
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
was
slightly
honeysweet
with
a
healthy
dose
of
corn
and
a
slight
noble
hop
spice
the
flavor
was
pretty
pedestrian
a
slight
graineyness
and
corn
flavor
without
a
real
hop
character
the
feel
was
thin
almost
like
a
bubbly
water
not
a
great
beer
the
flavor
is
lacking
along
with
the
feel
i
wont
be
having
this
again
not
much
to
recommend
this
over
other
beers
probably
their
attempt
to
be
budweiser
nothing
horrendous
mind
you
just
nothing
interesting
would
not
have
even
picked
this
up
for
curiosity
sake
unless
no
other
option
would
be
available
this
time
i
received
it
in
a
beers
of
the
worlds
gift
pack
and
complemented
with
some
mexican
take
out
its
better
than
a
corona
or
any
commericalized
beer
but
not
by
much
tastes
of
light
corn
and
little
hops
okay
carbonation
and
lacing
who
knows
how
long
its
been
on
the
store
shelf
try
something
else
luckily
from
the
outset
i
didnt
expect
much
so
i
wasnt
disappointed
when
i
got
exactly
what
i
expected
the
beer
is
very
clear
yellow
in
color
has
a
nice
white
typically
sized
head
my
bottle
seemed
to
have
a
bit
less
carbonation
than
similar
americanstyle
lagers
faint
almost
nonexistent
aromaprimarily
composed
of
adjunct
and
vegetable
smells
very
faint
hops
in
the
smell
provided
you
really
look
for
them
soft
and
slightly
sweet
but
also
thin
watery
and
weak
finish
is
clean
but
devoid
of
much
taste
on
par
with
most
american
macros
it
featured
a
standard
factorygrade
anemic
graycolored
fizz
on
top
it
went
away
quickly
the
aromas
told
of
accelerated
fermentation
grain
sugar
and
alcohol
bland
and
dry
it
served
up
impressions
of
rice
pancake
and
mineral
water
very
bud
lightlike
in
its
candied
thin
flavor
profile
stale
freezedried
pea
flavors
lurked
on
the
finish
this
was
the
most
tasteless
imported
beer
ive
ever
consumed
utterly
meaningless
you
always
walk
a
fine
line
when
buying
a
beer
just
because
it
is
from
a
new
country
i
knew
this
wouldnt
be
good
but
darn
it
i
wanted
to
try
an
argentinian
beer
i
am
sure
i
am
not
the
only
one
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
lasted
pretty
long
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
lightly
hopped
thinbodied
and
adjunctridden
with
a
weak
hops
and
malt
flavor
struggling
to
be
noticed
the
finish
is
clean
but
nearly
flavorless
i
have
definitely
had
worse
but
this
beer
really
serves
no
purpose
other
than
being
from
argentina
pours
a
bright
clear
yellow
with
large
bubbles
in
a
1
head
i
dont
like
large
bubbles
aroma
is
of
burnt
grain
oily
with
a
slight
hop
touch
flavor
is
moderate
grainy
with
slight
hops
at
the
end
processed
flavor
with
alightly
sweet
nutty
notes
very
easy
to
drink
but
mainly
because
there
isnt
much
going
on
fuller
and
richer
that
standard
us
macrobrews
but
thats
about
it
i
really
like
this
beer
for
sitting
around
telling
lies
and
eating
bbq
i
will
most
certainly
pick
some
more
up
to
have
on
hand
the
beer
has
the
words
the
favorite
beer
of
argentina
on
it
wtf
who
is
gong
to
believe
that
crap
oh
shit
i
did
and
thats
why
i
picked
up
a
bottle
on
reflection
the
advertising
slogan
sounds
like
the
favorite
child
of
michael
jackson
or
the
favorite
battle
cry
of
france
noone
is
going
to
believe
it
is
either
good
or
even
for
real
sure
enough
its
neither
could
this
be
south
american
ab
argentine
bud
maybe
super
drinkable
brew
it
goes
down
fast
nothing
offensive
about
this
but
it
is
low
flavor
compare
the
craft
brews
that
most
here
are
used
to
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
but
it
is
a
good
foodchasing
brew
the
high
appearance
marks
are
related
to
the
consistent
liveliness
of
the
carbonation
fine
bubbles
and
holding
of
the
head
in
the
glass
overall
as
a
pilsner
lover
i
dont
love
this
beer
this
beer
has
no
taste
at
all
it
just
goes
down
fast
and
easy
pretty
clear
and
crisp
hopy
smell
and
a
lttle
malty
it
reminds
me
of
alot
of
the
other
latina
american
beers
that
have
mad
it
big
in
the
us
corona
dos
x
in
the
sense
that
it
should
be
consumend
if
you
are
going
to
fry
under
the
sun
good
substitute
for
water
i
thought
ultra
was
the
most
flavorless
beer
id
run
across
here
it
has
met
its
match
aroma
well
if
water
has
an
aroma
this
smelled
about
the
same
as
for
flavor
no
malt
no
hops
about
all
i
got
was
some
vague
olivejuice
sourness
i
had
no
idea
that
a
beer
could
have
some
an
utter
absence
of
flavor
if
this
is
argentinas
favorite
beer
heaven
help
me
if

flavour
not

quite
insipid
in

a
bit
of
hoppiness
for
a

fades
into
very
little
as
much
aftertaste
as
a
bottle
of
spring
water
no
nasty
chemical

processed
tastes
that
i
could
detect
though
a
fine
beer
to
choose
for
a
summer
thirst
quencher
apart
from
the
smell
maybe
but
little
else
adios
the
flavor
is
a
different
story
and
not
one
im
pleased
to
tell
as
this
brew
has
an
off
taste
that
is
just
not
that
pleasant
an
offputting
pungent
flavor
invades
the
palate
and
lingers
far
too
long
just
not
sweet
nor
sour
but
rather
strong
and
pushy
the
feel
is
acidic
and
peppery
not
one
ill
go
back
to
again
my
girlfriend
allowed
me
the
honor
of
sampling
her
bottle
of
this
at
the
brickskellar
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
thin
foamy
head
that
was
gone
in
a
few
seconds
big
bubbles
i
think
this
one
had
been
sitting
in
their
cooler
for
a
few
months
about
the
only
thing
it
had
going
for
it
was
its
lack
of
skunk
though
very
light
thin
body
with
almost
absolutely
no
flavor
theres
just
not
much
to
this
one
maybe
if
i
were
in
argentina
and
needed
a
thirst
quencher
id
drink
it
but
theres
absolutely
no
reason
to
have
one
here

with

the

the

sparse

pours
a
pale
golden
tone
with
a
slight
foam
head
the
smell
is
not
very
present
but
shows
a
few
hops
the
taste
sweet
and
somewhat
bitter
reflects
some
maltyness
which
leaves
behind
no
bad
aftertaste
a
good
south
american
beer
above
the
average
and
always
a
good
purchase
in
the
region
a
little
sourness
and
hints
of
hops
that
are
very
reminiscent
of
about
90
percent
of

at

a
pretty
boring
beer
overall
this
is
my
first
time
sampling
an
argentinean
beer
i
hope
their
other
brews
have
more
depth
i
was
expecting
something
interesting
from
this
beer
since
i
have
never
had
an
argentine
beer
before
but
i
came
to
find
out
that
it
is
average
at
best
the
beer
had
a
decent
frothy
white
head
that
lasted
for
a
little
bit
and
then
settled
into
a
small
white
lace
for
the
rest
of
the
glass
the
smell
did
nothing
for
me
and
was
a
little
sour
the
taste
was
average
at
best
and
reminded
me
a
little
of
the
usual
macro
beers
available
in
the
u
s
it
would
be
easy
to
pound
back
a
few
of
these
but
it
is
nothing
that
would
be
very
enjoyable

the
palate

few
sips
are

the
taste
seemed
to
improve
as
the
beer
warmed
up
slightly
clean
dry
aftertase
all
in
all
not
too
bad
but
the
price
almost
8

for
a

ensured
ill
not
be
buying
this
again
fuck
this
stupid

system
this
beer
is
excellent
it
simply
does
not

good
not
any
worse

better

review
bottle
of
imperial
pale
lager
4
60abv
an
interesting
lager
from
costa
rica
imperial
a
very
pleasant
refreshing
light
lager
appearance
was
a
crystal
clear
pale
golden
straw
colour
what
a
normal
looking
lager
should
look
like
when
pouring
a
small
frothy
white
appeared
that
dissipated
relatively
fast
with
some
lacing
remaining
sweet
aroma
of
lightly
toasted
malt
with
corn
smell
was
great
very
enticing
similar
to
the
smell
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
grassy
flavour
of
a
creamy
aftertaste
of
dry
corn
sweetness
that
leaves
a
dry
feeling
in
the
mouth
overall
imperial
beer
is
a
standard
good
lager
mouthfeel
light
bodied
slightly
too
much
residual
sugar
i
drank
it
at
the
san
jose
airport
it
was
good
ehhh
had
this
in
costa
rica
and
i
tend
to
factor
sentimentality
into
my
reviews
for
example
i
love
gallo
but
mostly
because
i
had
it
in
guatemala
but
i
cant
even
muster
up
any
extra
love
for
imperial
just
cuz
i
had
it
in
jaco
before
the
crowds
got
there
o
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
goes
down
easily
enough
doesnt
absolutely
smack
of
corn
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
still
subpar
at
best
o
very
light
tasting
light
feeling
beer
cant
say
that
i
will
ever
buy
this
again
in
the
us
considering
all
of
the
other
cheaper
light
beers
available
hard
to
pay
10
for
6
when
its
comparable
in
enjoyment
to
miller
lite
etc
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
though
2
755
tasted
decent
perhaps
because
i
was
in
costa
rica
on
vacation
o
straight
forward
and
singular
pura
vida
o
a
typical
beer
for
this
style
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
costa
rica
before
so
when
i
found
this
at
whole
foods
in
savannah
i
was
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
try
it
well
done
for
the
style
just
nothing
outstanding
in
a
craft
beer
world
drank
at
cocoa
beach
fl
july
10th
drinkable
but
not
desirable
overall
if
you
like
lagers
and
you
want
something
that
is
reasonable
in
price
and
different
because
its
not
what
you
normally
drink
try
it
it
isnt
going
to
blow
you
away
but
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
o
for
a
latin
american
lager
it
aint
bad
i
would
chose
this
over
a
lot
of
mexican
lagers
then
again
i
hope
i
rarely
have
that
choice
overall
a
very
pleasant
light
lager
really
not
a
bad
beer
but
dont
expect
any
innovation
this
is
a
drinkable
unoffensively
flavored
mindless
gulping
beer
costa
rica
august
2010
a
crisp
and
refreshing
adjunct
lager
above
average
with
less
intense
offflavors
especially
when
drank
cold
but
far
from
great
more
standard
massproduced
swill
probably
tastes
better
colder
and
under
a
hot
subtropical
sun
yadda
yadda
yadda
nothing
worthy
drinking
unless
you
have
no
other
options
or
you
have
costa
rica
on
the
mind
obviously
light
in
body
it
stays
more
on
the
thin
side
which
avoids
the
nasty
slickness
thats
the
other
side
of
the
spectrum
with
these
its
as
crisp
as
it
should
be
taste
very
light
bodied
almost
no
malt
sweetness
nor
hop
bitterness
somehow
it
is
all
balanced
and
very
smooth
drinking
as
a
consequence
this
is
fine
to
sip
on
a
hot
day
no
need
to
pair
with
anything
im
a
little
curious
what
the
calorie
content
is
overall
was
not
impress
with
this
beer
at
all
the
weakest
lager
i
have
had
outside
a
light
beer
ois
this
a
good
beer
no
not
really
is
it
a
beer
that
i
drank
repeatedly
on
my
vacation
in
costa
rica
a
few
years
back
yes
was
it
appropriate
for
said
costa
rican
vacation
absolutely
in
all
seriousness
this
is
a
lightdrinking
aal
with
very
little
going
on
smell
or
tastewise
i
can
suggest
this
brew
as
a
beachpool
beer
but
not
much
more
there
is
a
reason
costa
rica
is
not
known
for
there
fine
brews
this
is
the
reason
looks
like
a
basic
pilsner
smells
lke
a
basic
pilsner
tastes
like
a
stale
pilsner
and
leaves
a
dry
feel
in
mouth
after
the
first
swallow
over
all
id
say
if
let
with
this
as
your
option
for
beer
choose
anything
else
or
just
go
thirsty
o
the
crisp
clean
lager
has
a
nice
touch
of
green
hops
that
is
supported
by
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
the
carbonation
makes
it
very
drinkable
i
cut
my
teeth
on
beer
in
costa
rica
drinking
this
beer
so
it
may
be
the
memories
but
i
havent
tasted
it
in
years
and
it
still
taste
just
as
nice
without
the
scenery
o
nothing
exciting
but
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
i
might
as
well
drink
miller
highlife
and
save
a
few
bucks
recently
had
a
6
pack
of
these
beers
last
night
it
was
on
sale
for
6
and
liked
it
alot
with
my
mexican
dinner
nice
light
malt
mouthfeel
clean
crisp
hops
no
skunky
after
taste
reminds
me
of
something
better
than
a
corona
but
maybe
not
as
good
as
a
radeburger
overall
a
very
drinkable
pale
lager
on
a
hot
summer
day
that
shouldnt
break
the
piggy
bank
overall
actually
not
that
bad
just
very
plain
and
low
on
flavor
could
drink
like
water
on
a
hot
day
no
problem
12
ounce
bottle

of
30

printed
on
it
i
assume
thats
the
best
by
date
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
and
grainy
malt
along
with
a
bit
of
skunk
unfortunately
its
a
little
worse
tasting
than
it
smells
it
tastes
mostly
like
skunky
grainy
malt
ive
tasted
worse
but
i
cant
say
this
is
exactly
appealing
and
it
gets
worse
the
longer
i
drink
it
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
a
bit
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
its
worth
trying
just
for
the
tick
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
sixer
of
this
just
stick
with
one
bottle
like
i
did
1
59
a
single
this
is
no
good
i
guess
its
okay
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
the
can
but
it
does
taste
like
apple
juice
a
little
bit
for
some
odd
reason
the
pour
is
standard
piss
lots
of
bubbles
the
nose
is
pretty
off
putting
skunky
and
acidic
flavor
is
apple
juice
and
watery
malt
its
one
of
those
cheap
beers
that
ends
up
in
the
fridge
sometimes
because
my
roomates
traveled
in
latin
america
and
i
guess
it
reminds
them
of
good
times
or
something
but
to
me
this
is
crap
sits
heavy
in
the
gut
is
too
light
to
get
drunk
off
of
and
is
just
a
pretty
repulsive
adjunct
beer
no
thanks
fits
the
style
profile
to
a
t
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
with
that

man
just
pouring
this
into
a
glass
and
it
was
aal
city
baby
phew
but
i
havent
smelled
that
special
admixture
for
a
while
and
here
i
was
getting
a
full
frontal
assault
i
had
two
rocky
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
topping
the
experience
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
allowing
me
to
see
into
an
unpleasant
future
drinking
crappy
beer
nose
smelled
like
silage
and
cardboard
a
combination
that
makes
me
wonder
why
anyone
would
bother
to
import
such
dreck
when
so
much
of
it
is
domestically
available
oh
well
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
it
tasted
like
dumbeddown
lager
that
hearkens
back
to
the
great
mistake
known
as
prohibition
it
had
a
simple
lager
flavor
embedded
in
whatever
corn
and
rice
adjuncts
they
saw
fit
to
add
to
the
mix
it
was
not
unpleasant
per
se
just
boring
as
all
getout
it
was
like
one
more
goround
with
the
old
lady
in
the
missionary
position
bland
vanilla
lacking
any
variety
of
any
stripe
finish
was
total
snooze
time
utterly
boring
cheers
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
buy
a
case
of
this
here
in
milwaukee
however
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
little
more
balanced
compared
to
others
in
the
style
as
it
has
a
light
amount
of
bitterness
and
isnt
that
malty
o
probably
one
of
the
beers
i
was
surprised
by
the
balance
of
flavor
since
that
is
not
common
in
the
style
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
ov
this
may
just
become
my
goto
adjunct
cheap
fix
it
has
a
much
better
flavor
than
bud
smoother
texture
than
busch
and
pbr
while
still
refreshing
like
a
miller
high
life
without
the
heavy
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
winner
and
its
cheap
i
still
have
5
more
to
go
cheers
this
brew
is
refershing
and
inoffensive
standard
latin
american
mass
produced
macrolager
the
aroma
is
grassy
the
malt
is
crisp
with
standard
slightlager
bitterness
nice
and
refreshing
in
costa
rica
better
than
budweiser
this
is
a
light
lager
thats
easy
to
drink
unoffensive
smooth
and
refreshing
but
unfortunately
forgettable
flavors
of
biscuity
malt
some
floral
hops
mild
bitterness
subtle
corn
and
buttery
notes
very
smooth
and
even
flavors
well
balanced
doesnt
have
that
acrid
aftertaste
that
so
many
adjunct
lagers
seem
to
have
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
but
full
enough
overall
not
a
bad
beer
totally
drinkable
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
good
for
days
when
you
know
you
will
drink
more
than
you
should
and
it
is
100
degrees
outside
however
compared
to
other
costa
rican
beers
like
pilsen
and
god
save
us
rock
ice
imperial
is
very
decent
maybe
i
would
not
purchase
it
in
the
us
except
for
nostalgias
sake
given
that
adjunct
lager
is
not
my
first
choice
but
if
im
in
costa
rica
im
going
with
imperial
every
time
overall
this
is
kind
of
an
alright
beer
its
better
than
budweiser
its
certainly
better
than
the
coronasoletc

of

the

it
goes
down

on

all
in

there
is
nothing
good
nor
bad
about
this
beer
it
is
amazingly
mundane
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
though
but
buy
a
single
bottle
do
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
itd
be
refreshing
on
par
with
other

better

its

an
average
lager
all
around
with
nothing
special
whatsoever
crystal
clear
and
straw
yellow
with
a
lasting
thin
cap
of
fine
white
bubbles
spotty
lacing
mild
aroma
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
faint
cereal
notes
clean
but
thats
all
i
could
pick
up
there
was
a
bit
more
going
on
in
the
flavour
mild
bitterness
with
dry
malty
sweetness
a
hint
of
grassy
and
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
creamy
carbonation
a
bit
dry
overall
it
was
pretty
clean
and
had
a
better
texture
than
most
in
this
style
poured
from
the
can
into
a
pint
glass
yellowish
straw
in
color
corn
and
grain
aroma
light
bodied
and
watery
with
corn
flavor
and
moderate
carbonation
a
yellow
fizzy
beer
that
is
best
consumed
on
hot
days
and
can
be
refreshing
served
cold
this
is
the
beer
in
costa
rica
and
is
ubiquitous
taste
bland
watery
lightly
sweet
nothing
in
terms
of
hops
fizzy
highly
carbonated
total
hot
weather
beer
nothing
going
for
it
otherwise
really
had
worse
had
much
much
better
national
brand
lagers
are
the
easiest
reviews
to
write
when
the
beer
is
bad
and
the
hardest
to
write
its
just
boringly
average
like
this
one
not
much
can
be
said
about
a
beer
that
is
so
mundane
by
design
emasculated
and
yet
so
far
as
most
people
would
be
concerned
easy
and
agreeable
i
found
it
to
be
just
that
and
im
sure
most
costa
ricans
do
too
just
got
back
from
costa
rica
and
like
everyone
says
imperial
is
everywhere
cerveceria
costa
rica
rules
the
market
there
picked
up
a
sixer
for
the
the
hotel
room
plus
had
it
on
numerous
occasions
with
meals
fizzy
yellow
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
smell
was
a
bit
musty
taste
was
decent
with
mostly
notes
of
corn
not
offensive
or
skunky
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
that
was
expected
a
good
hot
weather
beer
that
you
can
drink
on
the
beach
or
with
any
meal
from
the
same
brewery
i
liked
it
more
than
pilsen
but
honestly
i
think
that
bavaria
gold
was
slightly
better
jh
this
beer
was
legendary
growing
up
in
a
surfcrazed
area
of
florida
i
was
a
skateboarder
so
i
never
traveled
to
costa
rica
and
therefore
never
got
to
drink
imperial
though
i
did
have
plenty
of
guarocacique
liquor
that
my
teenaged
friends
smuggled
home
decades
later
i
am
having
my
first
imperial
it
looks
pretty
good
for
the
style
as
it
has
a
persistent
head
some
lace
and
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
golden
fizzy
lager
the
nose
is
mildly
sweet
and
offers
pale
grain
corn
and
mineral
notes
the
flavor
is
about
the
same
elementally
but
it
is
more
impressive
than
the
nose
for
some
intangible
reason
i
take
that
back
as
the
brew
airs
out
the
nose
is
also
taking
on
some
additional
positive
traits
there
seems
to
be
some
legit
fruitiness
albeit
very
mild
from
either
the
yeast
or
hops
i
cannot
say
the
feel
is
light
and
refreshing
i
ilke
it
drinkability
very
highly
drinkable
and
highly
refreshing
typical
of
they
style
yet
certainly
alot
better
then
my
expectations
more
reminds
me
of
a
lot
of
euro
lagers
in
flavor
a
good
beer
for
hot
summer
time
weather
thats
extremely
affordable
and
one
i
would
try
again
for
sure
this
is
what
to
serve
at
a
cook
out
or
bbq
on
a
hot
summer
night
suttle
smoothness
more
then
other
pilsners
is
has
not
sense
of
bitterness
and
is
quite
refreshing
as
a
pislner
it
is
the
major
beer
in
the
country
ect
bud
in
the
us
it
is
everywhere
and
90
in
bottlecan
only
found
on
tap
in
resorts
for
a
macro
its
better
than
most
they
go
down
easy
and
id
rather
drink
this
than
a
corona
any
day
nothing
to
seek
out
but
does
the
job
of
quenching
a
thirst
having
recently
visited
costa
rica
i
had
a
chance
to
sample
this
beer
frequently
theres
really
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
its
pretty
plain
and
boring
i
would
say
its
costa
ricas
very
own
budweiser
i
do
think
i
liked
it
better
than
pilsen
which
seems
to
be
its
big
competitor
but
not
by
much
this
beer
is
not
something
i
would
ever
spend
my
own
money
on
should
be
a
refreshing
summer
drink
but
not
a
recommendable
beer
pours
pale
or
very
pale
straw
yellow
with
minimal
head
nose
is
grainy
cereal
grainy
sweetness
on
palate
light
body
and
flavor
almost
outright
watery
little
hop
presence
back
of
the
palate
and
through
the
finish
light
hops
on
aftertaste
too
beats
u
s
bmc
but
still
fyb
pours
a
typical
macro
brew
head
and
gold
body
color
really
quite
a
light
beer
but
when
you
are
in
costa
rica
nothing
tastes
better
no
it
is
not
a
world
class
beer
but
it
has
good
flavor
albeit
little
and
great
refreshment
value
overall
a
fun
and
tasty
beer
but
only
to
be
consumed
cold
and
during
a
warmer
time
of
year
bottle
this
is
going
to
be
the
first
of
a
long
list
of
rating
for
some
pale
lager
form
costa
rica
poured
a
bright
golden
color
lager
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
of
lightly
sweet
adjunct
and
not
much
else
is
bland
taste
is
also
quite
bland
with
balanced
sweetness
originating
form
adjunct
body
is
medium
for
style
with
ok
carbonation
not
gross
in
any
way
and
i
guess
it
is
just
what
it
intended
to
be
my
wonderful
girlfriend
brought
this
to
me
on
her
return
from
s
semester
abroad
in
central
america
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
1
finger
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
ring
between
glass
and
beer
smells
slightly
of
adjuncts
and
i
think
i
caught
a
whiff
of
alcohol
my
first
sip
was
pretty
cold
and
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
taste
to
it
but
as
it
warmed
it
actually
displayed
some
nice
flavors
once
it
warmed
a
little
you
could
taste
the
sweet
malts
and
little
bit
of
hops
light
bodied
with
a
bubbly
carbonation
and
a
crisp
mouthfeel
at
4
6
abv
its
pretty
sessionable
overall
this
is
not
a
good
beer
compared
to
many
of
the
exceptional
styles
of
beer
on
this
website
but
it
certainly
held
my
interest
more
than
a
bud
or
any
other
adjunct
lager
i
have
tried
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
even
considering
the
style
its
a
bit
subpar
ive
certainly
had
much
worse
but
this
still
isnt
a
beer
i
would
choose
unless
my
choices
were
severely
limited
adjunct
lagers
can
actually
be
drinkable
but
this
one
falls
quite
outside
that
range
or
whatever
even
icefn
cold
i
couldnt
deal
with
the
gut
bloat
hell
wit
that
drinkability
well
when
i
cracked
this
central
american
brewski
i
was
looking
for
a
bit
of
cool
refreshment
in
a
glass
on
this
it
delivered
not
a
stellar
beer
by
any
means
but
judged
within
its
context
its
relatively
acceptable
easy
to
drink
would
go
well
in
a
steamy
jungle
with
your
revolutionary
friendscaptors
in
the
mouth
it
is
fresh
and
lively
carbonation
means
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
taste
is
reminiscent
of
the
aromatic
features
with
soft
malt
dominated
by
an
equally
moderate
citruszest
imperial
is
not
a
terrible
beer
but
its
not
going
to
breed
millions
of
followers
either
would
be
a
perfect
remedy
for
a
hot
day
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
with
a
thick
white
froth
of
a
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
soapy
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
faint
corn
rice
and
grasses
with
a
hint
of
light
citrus
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
taste
is
a
general
light
bitterness
combined
with
a
light
malty
sweetness
with
corn
syrup
the
predominant
feature
the
body
is
light
with
a
good
carbonation
a
watery
texture
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
an
ok
brew
definitely
not
a
favorite
but
also
not
all
that
objectionable
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
very
high
easy
to
drink
not
too
filling
very
refreshing
although
not
as
flavorful
as
most
craft
beers
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
hot
day
the
beer
pours
a
clear
macro
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
corn
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
adjunct
tasting
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
basically
no
hop
bitterness
light
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
slightly
sweet
in
flavor
with
a
moderate
viscosity
on
the
feel
standard
malt
profile
with
a
good
carbonation
and
a
slightly
bready
texture
rather
easy
drinking
as
the
beer
treads
lightly
on
the
palate
yet
offering
enough
flavor
to
keep
from
distracting
some
crisp
malty
taste
to
it
but
not
much
in
flavor
out
side
that
it
has
a
sour
aftertaste
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
good
either
overall
this
was
my
first
costa
rican
beer
it
seemed
to
remind
me
of
a
decent
beer
called
tona
but
that
one
was
from
costa
rica
as
well
no
wait
that
one
was
from
mexi
no
it
was
from
equidor
nah
maybe
it
was
from
venezua
wait
it
was
from
nicaragua
dear
god
i
should
have
said
south
amer
no
maybe
i
meant
new
zeala
no
perhaps
not
quite
north
america
or
south
but
somewhere
in
between
it
was
a
good
beer
one
i
will
buy
again
330
ml
bottle
that
some
friends
of
mine
brought
to
from
costa
rica
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
good
head
that
last
for
a
while
and
leaves
some
lace
other
than
that
nothing
significant
in
this
beer
anodyne
aroma
just
grainy
and
with
some
malt
in
the
mouth
it
feels
the
same
with
a
bit
of
citrus
flavor
what
flavor
of
course
in
a
very
hot
weather
i
guess
i
could
have
some
of
them
its
just
refreshing
just
boring
flavor
is
as
expected
grainy
malt
lightly
sweet
finish
is
short
average
d
given
that
these
are
meant
for
a
hot
costa
rican
day
they
all
drink
well
ill
give
a
slight
nod
to
pilsen
and
bavaria
imperial

let
me
just
state
that
i
have
had
worse
beers
that
this
one
its
just
another
standard
macro
lager
that
you
can
buy
for
about
1
25
a
bottle
very
thin
watery
mouthfeel
just
a
slight
bite
of
carbonation
which
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
after
a
few
heartier
tastier
beers
this
one
is
ace
to
help
you
keep
going
in
a
session
i
dont
recommend
this
beer
i
wont
be
seeking
this
beer
fortunately
it
is
not
at
all
common
so
i
dont
have
to
worry
with
being
offered
it
and
i
wont
be
spending
my
money
on
this
one
ive
had
much
worse
its
not
out
and
out
offensive
like
other
beers
can
be
but
what
an
incredibly
pissweak
effort
if
this
werent
from
costa
rica
it
would
not
be
worth
it
even
for
a
try
costa
ricans
should
just
stick
to
what
is
it
costa
ricans
do
unfortunately
i
didnt
even
get
to
drink
this
beer
ive
had
this
before
and
wanted
to
try
it
again
and
when
i
poured
this
it
was
a
nice
straw
color
and
it
also
looked
like
someone
dumped
cottage
cheese
into
it
it
had
little
floating
globules
of
who
knows
what
could
possibly
be
yeast
ive
seen
yeast
in
a
glass
before
but
this
is
ridiculous
i
dont
even
trust
it
to
be
drank
straight
drain
pour
but
it
smelled
good
at
least
poured
a
yellow
golden
color
with
a
nice
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
white
head
nose
is
grainy
lightly
hopped
and
some
malts
taste
is
sweet
malty
light
hops
and
grain
pretty
fizzy
beer
and
has
some
good
mouthfeel
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
style
wont
drink
again
but
not
half
bad
pours
a
typical
clear
strawyellow
but
it
does
have
a
fairly
thick
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
aroma
is
not
strong
but
malty
flavor
is
fairly
malty
and
has
a
decent
yeasty
undertone
texture
is
fizzy
and
lively
this
brews
strongest
point
average
overall
but
drinkable
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
somewhat
pale
color
with
about
a
12
inch
head
aroma
is
faint
and
slightly
bitter
has
a
crisp
light
flavor
feels
watery
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
due
to
its
lightness
overall
a
mediocore
choice
notes
better
than
coronabut
hardly
what
i
would
like
to
call
good
still
a
beer
that
can
help
with
thirst
on
a
hot
day
and
i
like
to
keep
a
few
beers
like
this
but
slightly
better
ones
in
the
fridge
to
start
the
day
off
in
hot
temps
drinkability
fine
taste
is
above
average
in
the
quantity
of
flavor
that
it
presents
for
an
adjunct
lager
sweet
malts
are
there
followed
by
a
decent
hop
bitterness
this
really
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
for
kicking
it
on
a
central
american
beach
for
the
style
i
find
this
to
be
somewhat
enjoyable
thanks
goes
out
to
lauren
who
brought
this
home
for
me
on
a
warm
night
like
tonight
this
isnt
going
to
cut
it
but
in
costa
rica
thats
every
night
there
must
be
better
national
brands
from
there
to
enjoy
right
12
ounce
bottle
pours
the
expected
light
clear
yellowy
amber
minimal
near
white
head
zip
retention
and
very
minor
bits
of
lace
sliding
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
perhaps
a
hint
of
powdered
sugar
in
the
nose
light
fairly
taste
less
beverage
a
hint
of
dryness
in
the
finish
lawn
mower
beer
on
a
very
hot
day
at
the
beach
by
the
poolthis
would
be
enjoyable
with
a
burger
otherwise
pass
it
by
its
what
you
would
expect
with
color
head
and
smell
of
a
light
lager
but
i
agree
with
one
of
the
other
reviewers
in
that
if
you
have
a
choice
between
a
corona
and
an
imperial
the
latter
is
the
best
choice
especially
in
c
r
where
corona
is
double
the
price
and
it
needs
a
lime
to
give
it
a
better
flavor
while
imperial
is
fine
all
on
its
own
picked
up
a
sixer
for
7
from
publix
in
miami
and
brought
it
down
to
south
beach
this
was
a
great
beach
beer
sure
it
didnt
taste
like
much
but
it
was
refreshing
and
clean
really
its
just
a
plain
light
bready
water
taste
with
very
light
touch
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
really
this
beer
is
the
ideal
adjunct
lager
no
flavor
flavor
with
absolutely
no
offflavors
id
take
this
over
miller
lite
or
budweiser
any
day
overall
i
am
thankful
to
be
able
to
sample
this
because
i
love
trying
beer
form
all
over
but
i
dont
think
that
i
will
seek
this
one
out
this
would
probably
be
a
decent
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
with
a
sandwich
and
some
chips
at
the
current
price
i
may
buy
more
last
week
imperial
is
to
cr
what
budweiser
is
to
the
usa
you
see
locals
and
tourists
alike
sitting
around
with
quart
bottles
in
certain
locales
ok
to
quench
a
thirst
after
a
long
drive
hike
or
flight
served
its
purpose
at
the
time
but
i
preferred
the
other
popular
cr
option
pilsen
and
then
bavaria
dark
to
this
most
popular
national
brand
btw
the
canned
version
tasted
very
metallic
when
compared
to
the
bottle
d
the
only
thing
this
beer
proved
is
that
there
exists
a
beer
to
create
an
average
with
all
the
fantastic
beers
out
there
pours
like
any
typical
yellow
fizzy
beer
but
with
a
head
that
fades
to
nothing
pretty
quickly
smells
clean
and
lightly
hoppy
on
the
finish
not
bad
the
taste
is
grainy
and
somewhat
sweet
but
not
as
bad
as
some
of
these
adjunct
lagers
not
as
hoppy
as
the
smell
but
there
is
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
crisp
but
a
bit
too
grainy
in
the
mouth
better
than
some
but
really
just
for
consumption
on
the
beach
its
your
typical
latin
american
beer
light
watery
lacks
flavor
although
i
have
to
admit
after
trekking
through
the
forests
of
manual
antonio
for
5
hours
the
imperial
was
quite
refreshing
much
more
so
then
say
an
abyss
i
do
like
it
better
than
corona
though
so
i
give
it
that
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
my
rating
would
suggest
for
a
pilseneresque
lager
it
was
very
clean
and
refreshing
with
only
a
slight
hint
of
cereal
adjuncts
the
malts
were
evident
but
not
too
flavorful
while
hops
were
nowhere
to
be
found
mouthfeel
was
obviously
light
bubbly
and
crisp
and
the
finish
was
so
clean
that
it
nearly
evaporated
off
the
back
of
the
palate
great
after
a
long
day
of
hiking
in
the
costa
rican
sun
but
nothing
special
if
youre
expecting
a
flavorful
lager
this
brew
grew
on
me
quite
a
bit
this
is
not
a
style
that
i
particularly
enjoy
but
this
is
a
pretty
standard
example
doesnt
really
put
a
foot
wrong
not
that
its
going
to
set
the
world
on
fire
either
more
substantial
than
most
mexican
beers
i
guess
the
costa
ricans
wanted
more
but
not
much
more
clear
yellow
with
a
white
head
still
corny
and
sugary
but
actually
has
a
grassy
hoplike
flavor
crisper
than
most
but
still
cant
chake
the
candy
corn
taste
d
i
expected
to
not
really
like
this
so
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
dont
get
me
wrong
this
wasnt
complex
or
full
of
flavour
instead
it
was
quite
bland
but
had
good
balance
very
easy
to
drink
er
slam
down
given
my
review
i
should
give
a
low
rating
on
the
drinkability
however
this
beer
has
a
cerain
nostalgia
factor
to
me
given
it
is
the
primary
beer
you
drink
while
in
costa
1994
i
had
many
of
these
after
late
night
surf
sessions
in
cr
with
the
local
ticos
and
discotech
crowds
as
a
result
i
love
the
logo
the
tico
population
and
country
and
i
always
enjoy
one
of
these
to
step
back
to
some
good
vibes
and
memories
of
good
old
costa
rica
so
i
give
it
a
3
0
if
you
have
been
there
you
should
understand
d
i
had
a
few
as
it
was
the
best
thing
offered
at
the
bar
i
was
at
in
delaware
at
least
i
can
cross
costa
rica
off
my
list
drinkability
youve
gotta
equally
water
down
your
expectations
for
these
lackluster
foreign
lager
but
even
still
this
was
a
disappointment
pours
a
clear
pale
with
a
small
almost
non
existent
head
smells
of
tons
of
corn
and
not
much
malt
first
sip
is
corn
and
more
corn
with
a
not
much
hop
presence
very
light
bodied
and
typical
of
beers
from
latin
america
pretty
bad
stuff
hardly
worth
boiling
hot
dogs
in
an
absolute
failure
on
all
counts
this
beers
symbol
had
been
used
for
imperial
house
in
shc
at
psu
definitely
the
best
place
to
live
at
psu
from
20022004
i
finally
saw
this
at
a
local
grocery
store
so
of
course
i
had
to
pick
it
up
looks
pretty
standard
straw
color
moderately
persistent
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
not
much
to
speak
of
as
is
usual
for
the
style
some
grassy
hops
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
some
light
maltiness
very
little
hops
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
balanced
and
no
off
notes
light
but
it
has
some
body
fairly
drinkable
quite
pleasant
for
the
style
dnothing
to
write
home
about
unless
your
in
a
really
hot
environment
its
the
bud
of
costa
rica
non
offensive
tasting
that
can
go
down
very
quickly
without
knowing
it
again
only
drink
when
nothing
else
available
the
drink
is
lightbodied
crisp
and
refreshing
with
superb
drinkability
not
bad
this
is
almost
budwiser
with
out
the
beachwood
ageing
this
is
just
nasty
thank
god
it
was
1
50
i
would
have
felt
cheated
if
i
payed
more
this
beer
poured
a
week
golden
color
and
no
head
its
smell
was
corn
and
not
much
eles
it
was
week
all
around
i
would
avoide
this
one
at
all
cost
drinkability
no
bueno
a
cheap
beer
for
the
masses
id
drink
one
for
free
did
but
would
always
buy
something
else
i
choke
down
imperial
simply
because
there
are
few
alternatives
living
in
california
id
never
seek
out
a
beer
like
imperial
on
a
daily
basis
but
if
i
lived
in
a
climate
as
hot
as
costa
rica
im
sure
id
suck
these
things
down
by
the
case
load
its
a
very
light
lager
refreshing
and
very
clean
its
not
sweet
or
hoppy
just
refreshing
i
wont
ever
crave
one
again
but
if
i
go
back
to
costa
rica
ill
happily
drink
my
share
of
them
d
drinkability
is
ok
its
a
beer
that
doesnt
bring
much
new
to
the
table
it
certainly
isnt
bad
its
a
good
choice
while
in
costa
rica
as
its
also
the
most
common
beer
there
nice
grassy
smell
floral
hops
citrusy
taste
was
around
the
same
bland
aftertaste
not
much
to
it
very
drinkable
and
would
try
this
again
if
i
were
ever
in
costa
rica
drank
this
fishing
in
costa
rica
the
budweiser
of
costa
rica
drank
this
when
i
couldnt
get
my
hands
on
bavaria
dark
which
ill
review
later
this
brew
has
a
smell
of
corn
or
rice
with
not
much
else
pours
to
a
bright
yellow
into
the
chalice
which
is
way
to
elegant
for
this
beer
not
much
head
almost
pours
flat
taste
is
highly
carbonated
watery
and
niether
bitter
nor
sweet
is
this
colored
seltzer
water
yipes
this
beer
is
too
light
it
may
be
on
for
its
style
but
i
think
it
still
lacks
it
was
good
however
in
the
heat
and
for
that
it
gets
a
high
drinkability
rating
im
a
fan
of
the
label
only
super
super
boring
and
bland
but
its
not
offensive
and
therefore
could
be
drank
without
problem
if
youre
stuck
with
it
nothing
fancy
or
special
going
on
here
worth
a
try
for
sure
not
bad
cerveza
type
macro
i
got
a
huge
note
of
malt
sugar
straight
off
the
nose
that
persisted
through
to
the
end
malt
crystal
i
dont
know
finishes
clean
and
is
a
good
replacement
for
corona
swill
and
its
ilk
i
really
like
the
intense
malt
sugar
but
it
would
be
considered
a
flaw
in
a
show
i
would
certainly
prefer
this
to
the
usual
round
of
bland
southcentral
american
corona
types
imperial
pours
a
typical
lager
yellow
with
a
white
head
thats
laces
nicely
as
it
falls
it
was
packaged
in
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
lets
just
say
the
aroma
isnt
offensive
a
touch
of
corn
perhaps
the
flavor
is
also
inoffensive
its
not
in
the
corona
clone
family
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
malt
along
with
the
corn
not
bad
for
what
it
is
a
simple
crisp
light
lager
d
overall
theres
nothing
special
about
this
beer
costa
rica
can
keep
it
its
not
really
much
better
than
a
bmc
beer
very
disappointing
hand
delivered
from
costa
rica
to
south
bend
in
pours
pretty
clear
yellow
and
lightlooking
big
puffy
head
bubbles
rising
constantly
light
malt
odor
mildly
sour
hints
of
apples
taste
of
mild
malt
and
green
apples
hint
of
tanginess
clean
and
fresh
tasting
thin
bodied
maybe
a
bit
watery
a
good
lawnmowing
beer
though
not
right
now
in
december
6deg
outside
but
not
really
anything
superspecial
overall
a
good
looking
mexilager
but
nothing
special
better
than
a
corona
and
on
a
par
with
any
decent
american
macro
but
whats
the
point
a
reasonable
alternative
at
the
mexican
place
if
nothing
better
is
available
d
goes
down
smoothly
and
overall
not
a
bad
refreshing
lager
more
going
on
than
i
expected
and
if
i
had
to
choose
bt
a
lot
of
those
imported
lagers
you
get
at
mexican
restaurants
this
would
be
the
one
overall
i
think
it
is
pretty
good
i
was
expecting
another
third
world
piece
of
crap
beer
that
would
get
dumped
down
the
drain
but
i
ended
up
going
all
the
way
with
this
one
pretty
routine
macro
lager
nothing
really
terrible
nothing
really
memorable
it
is
what
it
is
didnt
enjoy
it
didnt
dislike
it
would
never
buy
it
in
a
store
or
order
it
in
a
restaurant
with
more
beer
options
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
spotty
lacing
there
are
lots
of
floaties
present
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
some
adjuncts
its
rather
sweet
smelling
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
dry
lager
taste
that
is
light
and
easy
drinking
there
is
little
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
light
lager
its
devoid
of
any
malt
character
i
suppose
its
a
great
beer
for
those
living
around
the
equator
overall
a
good
latin
american
lager
easy
to
drink
drinkability
at
4
6abv
this
doesnt
get
to
me
like
the
dfh
world
wide
stout
i
had
earlier
did
i
have
had
a
coouple
now
and
for
a
macro
lagertype
this
is
pretty
damn
good
i
had
my
standards
pretty
low
for
this
one
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
not
great
but
it
did
hit
the
spot
d
a
pretty
good
beer
could
see
it
being
great
in
the
tropical
costa
rican
climate
dthere
really
are
no
off
flavours
here
and
while
the
style
may
not
be
my
top
choice
this
is
excellent
for
the
style
i
am
slightly
shocked
at
the
quality
of
this
beer
most
foreign
macro
lagers
are
pretty
shitty
this
one
is
alright
if
i
am
in
the
need
for
a
lighter
style
this
one
beats
the
polishamerican
ones
available
in
my
neighbourhood
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
lot
of
white
fluffy
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
theres
a
lot
of
bubbles
coming
out
of
this
thing
smells
faintly
of
yeast
and
a
tiny
bit
floral
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
a
little
hoppy
flavor
but
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
it
balances
out
pretty
well
the
mouthfeel
is
creamier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
very
nice
overall
its
very
drinkable
very
nice
for
a
hot
day
notes
of
the
two
beers
head
to
head
i
liked
the
depth
and
the
fact
that
the
hops
actually
made
an
appearance
in
the
cuscuena
i
liked
the
imperial
better
for
being
lighter
and
more
refreshing
drinkability
not
the
best
session
beer
but
its
quite
refreshing
its
light
and
easy
going
in
my
mouth
its
a
very
easily
drinkable
beer
but
as
for
the
next
one
well
lets
try
something
else
i
was
actually
relatively
surprised
by
this
beer
its
much
better
than
other
central
american
beers
that
ive
had
in
the
past
nothing
spectacular
but
for
something
so
cheap
its
a
good
one
and
the
corn
elements
in
the
smell
and
taste
are
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
probably
goes
best
with
some
food
i
would
certainly
consider
getting
this
again
with
some
takeout
mexican
food
drinkability
is
pretty
good
on
this
one
i
wouldnt
turn
a
cold
one
down
especially
in
the
heat
and
humidity
of
costa
rica
but
i
prefer
pilsen
tried
this
beer
on
a
recent
trip
to
costa
rica
i
thought
it
was
pretty
darn
good
considering
cr
is
a
major
exporter
of
coffee
not
beer
very
refreshing
and
light
with
nice
clean
flavors
like
an
upscale
budwiser
perhaps
im
sure
the
tropical
weather
enhanced
its
taste
as
well
drinkability
its
a
little
better
than
most
of
our
adjunct
lagers
but
thats
not
saying
much
to
be
drunk
cold
and
quick
as
someone
else
said
but
after
a
long
day
in
the
sun
and
surf
i
needed
nothing
more
than
a
clean
light
beer
and
plenty
of
them
at
1
degree
c
they
hit
the
spot
i
really
enjoyed
this
refreshing
beer
the
apperance
is
average
golden
in
color
tiny
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
very
little
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
sweet
corn
and
banana
come
through
the
taste
is
similiar
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
makes
this
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
id
definitely
recommend
giving
this
a
try
pretty
much
michelob
from
costa
rica
avoid
if
possible
i
suppose
that
it
could
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
so
are
so
many
beers
with
an
actual
flavor
still
better
than
most
american
light
macros
easily
drinkable
just
another
average
at
best

much
your
standard
macro
lager
if
i
didnt
know
better
rough
graininess
dry
and
crisp
i
cant
see
it
but
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
with
mild
toasted
grain
and
light
spice
with
hint
of
floral
hops
and
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
overall
not
the
best
but
mediocre
exceeded
my
expectations
to
be
honest
this
beer
is
just
bad
nice
crisp
light
flavored
beer
could
definitely
pound
a
ton
of
these
without
getting
filled
up
i
like
this
beer
its
good
itll
do
in
a
pinch
for
the
cheapest
beer
at
the
beer
store
still
not
too
good
the
only
reason
to
drink
this
is
for
the
puzzles
under
the
cap
its
not
awful
i
guess
its
just
not
really
good
overallyou
get
what
you
pay
for
14
bucks
a
case
i
was
expecting
worse
if
youre
in
a
pinch
this
is
a
lot
better
than
natural
ice
old
milwaukee
or
any
of
the
other
cheap
and
awful
beers
if
you
can
afford
better
though
then
get
better
ahhhh
lions
head
what
can
i
say
this
might
be
the
best
basement
bargain
beer
in
a
bottle
oh
yes
buy
the
bottle
or
give
it
a
drain
poor
in
the
bottle
it
is
an
outstanding
cheap
drinker
but
they
must
buy
the
left
over
cans
from
steel
city
the
taste
coming
out
of
a
can
is
of
licking
the
aluminum
shavings
off
the
brewery
floor
and
stay
away
from
the
light
version
too
the
regular
pilsner
is
light
enough
so
if
you
need
a
cheap
bottle
that
goes
down
easy
and
will
please
most
on
a
hot
day
drink
up
my
friend
bonus
the
mind
teasers
under
the
caps
can
keep
a
group
of
local
drunks
amused
for
hours
of
cheap
fun
overall
nothing
fantastic
but
for
the
price
and
as
a
session
beer
it
is
a
good
go
to
on
any
occasion
when
drinking
is
more
a
background
activity
i
had
this
one
in
a
bottle
before
and
was
unimpressed
much
better
from
a
can
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
a
touch
of
corn
is
present
taste
is
crisp
refreshing
some
malts
and
corn
very
easy
drinking
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
at
this
price
point
makes
a
good
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
not
terrible
but
not
the
deluxe
pilsner
the
the
label
trumpets
but
i
paid
5
89
for
a
sixer
i
expect
more
beer
for
my
hard
earned
money
add
2
and
get
a
really
good
craft
is
my
suggestion
in
its
defense
it
wouldnt
be
bad
to
pour
a
couple
back
on
a
hot
sc
summer
day
forget
serve
very
cold
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
bready
cracker
like
cereal
tastes
very
malty
this
pilsner
is
tasty
and
blends
well
with
the
cajun
food
i
was
eating
bottom
line
for
under
15
00
bucks
a
case
this
stuff
is
a
steal
and
an
alcoholics
dream
o
supposed
to
be
a
pilsner
doesnt
really
taste
like
one
its
a
great
beer
for
the
price
16
a
case
tax
included
in
pa
as
a
college
student
this
beer
is
my
goto
for
throwing
back
1015
in
a
night
think
light
lager
not
deluxe
pilsner
as
per
the
can
and
youll
be
much
less
disappointed
this
is
my
first
beer
review
ever
so
i
thought
id
start
with
a
simple
beer
like
lionshead
i
was
first
introduced
to
lionshead
my
sophomore
year
at
penn
state
being
from
pa
i
often
see
this
beer
at
parties
its
cheap
and
decent
tasting
considering
its
inexpensiveness
and
sessioning
ability
most
importantly
its
a
crowdpleaser
each
cap
has
a
riddle
on
it
with
pictures
and
you
try
to
decide
what
phrase
the
pictures
mean
this
beer
does
not
smell
good
nor
do
i
think
it
was
even
meant
to
be
smelled
what
does
it
smell
like
well
the
only
good
descriptor
i
can
give
is
that
it
smells
like
beer
it
smells
like
a
frat
house
the
day
after
they
had
a
big
party
and
spilled
a
lot
of
natty
on
the
floor
it
pours
an
orangeishgold
very
clear
no
head
its
taste
is
very
watery
with
mild
carbonation
it
has
more
beer
taste
than
other
session
beers
like
miller
lite
coors
lite
and
bud
lite
but
less
than
a
regular
yuengling
also
its
mouthfeel
is
very
light
too
this
beer
is
a
good
choice
if
its
used
what
its
meant
for
buying
serving
and
drinking
in
bulk
one
of
the
better
session
beers
out
there
people
at
your
party
will
think
thank
god
not
another
party
with
only
bud
light
oooh
a
puzzle
overall
its
you
averagetypical
adjunct
lager
on
the
sweet
side
not
bad
for
what
it
is
and
rated
as
such
inoffensive
there
are
worse
lawn
mower
beers
out
there
for
sure
12
oz
bottle
pours
golden
with
a
short
lived
white
head
and
sodalike
carbonation
aroma
is
sourdough
and
hint
of
hops
body
is
light
and
smooth
taste
is
sourdough
some
sweet
malt
and
cooked
vegetables
finish
is
short
and
sour
i
dont
understand
why
college
kids
by
cases
of
this
crap
close
but
no
cigar
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
straw
color
with
little
head
smells
slightly
of
grain
but
not
much
else
tastes
of
a
regular
adjunct
lager
but
has
a
fuller
taste
than
most
carbonation
is
good
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
an
average
beer
lighter
medium
body
well
carbonated
pretty
watery
and
fast
on
the
palate
this
isnt
bad
for
an
adjunct
but
its
not
what
id
consider
to
be
a
good
beer
either
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
pils
like
hop
and
a
small
skunkyness
in
the
taste
a
small
pils
hop
and
a
small
sweetness
quite
muted
across
the
board
a
small
hop
bite
but
mainly
smooth
with
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
note
of
dry
to
clean
to
no
aftertaste
very
muted
eh
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
ah
college
overall
average
taste
and
overall
beer
but
its
great
for
the
price
and
is
certainly
better
than
bud
miller
or
coors
ale
yellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
what
so
ever
really
just
a
clear
over
carbonated
mess
of
a
look
for
me
but
a
trudge
on
weak
grains
touches
of
light
corn
and
bready
notes
abound
here
again
not
that
i
was
expecting
a
ton
of
wonderful
flavor
here
but
it
could
have
been
more
then
the
wet
cardboard
that
i
got
clean
and
crisp
light
feel
worked
for
the
style
and
it
went
down
smooth
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
decide
to
try
something
different
at
the
ball
game
since
the
majority
of
the
stand
was
malternatives
i
thought
i
give
a
lions
head
a
try
not
trying
to
make
it
this
review
like
goldielocks
but
it
wasnt
to
grainy
or
corny
the
smell
was
just
right
for
the
price
it
was
just
right
was
a
cheap
beer
but
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
either
pretty
smooth
and
not
too
light
by
no
means
is
it
one
of
my
favorites
just
a
descent
beer
to
get
when
i
have
no
money
the
smell
was
alright
and
it
gave
off
a
little
bit
of
an
aftertaste
i
would
prefer
it
over
most
light
beers
but
definitely
no
one
i
would
get
often
also
it
is
much
better
out
of
the
bottle
then
can
d
not
offensive
by
any
means
just
not
much
here
in
terms
of
flavor
o
the
beer
goes
down
easily
but
nothing
really
stands
out
in
the
taste
that
would
want
me
to
try
another
not
quite
sure
if
this
can
be
called
a
beer
or
not
smells
of
any
fine
watered
down
american
pilsner
the
taste
is
odd
in
that
it
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
what
i
would
call
grapes
it
ends
with
somewhat
of
a
bitter
note
but
just
a
little
the
appearance
along
with
price
is
about
all
this
has
going
for
it
cannot
complain
though
it
is
always
there
on
a
hot
day
when
i
have
no
money
overall
not
too
exciting
for
an
american
beer
but
went
well
with
dinner
prost
well
worth
the
money
and
for
the
price
not
likely
to
find
much
better
good
affordable
drinking
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
barely
any
head
to
it
aroma
is
of
light
hops
and
reminiscent
of
a
bmc
beer
taste
is
much
better
though
than
the
usual
cheap
beer
little
but
of
fruitiness
on
the
palate
and
nice
mouthfeel
and
finish
goes
down
easy
for
what
it
is
not
bad
at
all
a
nice
cheap
beer
to
throw
back
at
the
end
of
the
night
priced
right
and
plus
theres
cool
little
puzzles
on
the
back
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
beer
i
recommend
this
if
you
can
find
it
this
takes
me
back
to
college
not
that
i
enjoyed
it
there
but
everyone
around
me
loved
this
stuff
i
guess
its
because
it
was
affordable
and
local
to
us
here
in
pa
this
beer
is
a
traditional
lager
that
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
head
the
actually
has
a
little
lacing
down
the
glass
this
beer
is
light
bodied
and
not
overly
flavorful
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
it
smells
like
all
adjunct
lagers
corn
musty
and
kind
of
sweet
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
nose
as
it
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
cornmalts
no
real
hop
presence
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
on
par
for
the
style
maybe
just
slightly
less
carbonated
it
is
very
drinkable
given
it
is
not
that
flavorful
or
complex
as
far
as
the
style
goes
its
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
for
the
price
its
a
steal
my
favorite
part
about
this
beer
is
the
design
the
6
pack
handle
has
finger
holes
like
brass
knuckles
sort
of
totally
hardcorey
looking
branding
nice
unique
half
label
looks
very
nice
for
a
regular
bmcish
beer
well
this
seems
like
a
fruity
macro
lager
its
not
horrible
but
not
really
good
either
i
guess
it
would
be
a
bit
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
plus
it
goes
down
pretty
east
but
other
than
that
this
has
few
redeeming
qualities
like
many
reviewers
i
picked
up
a
case
of
this
based
on
price
in
my
case
har
at
a
bottle
king
in
nj
i
had
never
heard
of
it
nor
seen
it
in
ny
or
nj
before
unfortunately
the
nofrills
packaging
was
an
accurate
signal
of
the
contents
not
horrible
but
nothing
id
ever
repeat
id
love
to
find
a
great
unsung
american
beer
but
this
one
doesnt
do
it
if
you
are
in
the
pa
vicinity
best
to
go
with
yuengling
or
even
the
better
penn
offerings
lionshead
has
an
unpleasant
alcoholfortified
aftertaste
and
is
very
thin
on
the
palate
id
like
to
say
its
a
good
goto
budget
offering
but
i
cant
given
the
many
better
options
out
there
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
mildly
sweet
on
the
onset
the
finish
is
a
little
grainy
but
its
not
too
bad
overall
its
an
easy
drinking
sessionable
pilsner
i
sort
of
enjoyed
it
free
beer
right
lets
be
honest
for
me
its
local
contract
brewed
but
why
should
that
matter
its
cheap
around
13
a
case
and
its
just
drinkable
its
light
and
refreshing
no
frills
here
just
cold
and
good
when
a
dude
is
at
his
thirstiest
lionshead
will
always
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
used
to
buy
a
case
of
bottles
of
this
every
friday
for
a
while
from
the
local
beverage
the
taste
smooth
for
sure
goes
down
like
water
but
it
is
somewhat
filling
i
could
probly
only
put
down
about
12
of
these
in
one
night
no
more
than
that
but
all
in
all
its
a
good
beer
im
proud
to
be
from
pa
when
i
drink
this
beer
go
steelers
this
beer
isnt
terribly
filled
of
flaws
so
why
is
everything
they
contract
brew
seem
so
awful
d
a
below
average
pilsner
not
awful
but
nothing
too
enjoyable
about
it
either
some
basic
grain
and
bread
in
the
smell
and
taste
wouldnt
seek
out
again
but
better
than
some
macros
this
is
a
beer
that
your
gramps
and
his
pals
would
sit
around
and
drink
while
swapping
tales
about
the
big
war
and
i
mean
that
as
a
compliment
very
straight
forward
regular
pilsner
no
muss
no
fuss
pours
a
light
gold
and
has
a
very
small
head
very
easy
beer
to
drink
smells
and
tastes
better
than
most
big
named
beers
drinks
like
a
light
beer
and
tastes
better
than
bud
and
miller
the
price
makes
it
worth
it
there
are
also
puzzles
under
the
cap
im
gonna
reuse
the
shit
outta
that
image
no
just
kidding
this
beer
is
very
good
for
its
price
13
and
change
for
an
18
pack
of
16oz
cans
and
its
better
than
other
cheap
college
kid
beers
that
im
accustomed
to
drinking
about
15
for
a
24
of
12oz
bottles
for
you
glass
snobs
it
doesnt
have
that
piss
water
taste
like
natty
natural
light
for
the
older
folks
and
it
doesnt
have
that
i
think
im
gonna
puke
taste
like
pbr
pabst
blue
ribbon
overall
a
smart
purchase
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
to
drink
beer
for
social
occasions
but
dont
want
to
spend
that
much
money
plus
youll
also
stand
out
from
the
bud
light
miller
lite
crowd
had
from
the
bottle
in
a
case
a
friend
gave
me
really
vague
in
taste
much
more
flavourful
than
miller
light
but
less
then
a
craft
pilsner
barley
and
grain
malts
were
pretty
much
the
taste
through
out
with
a
hop
finish
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
though
a
noce
light
bodied
pilsner
for
sure
lionshead
on
draft
was
a
pretty
decent
experience
i
havent
had
this
beer
before
but
it
was
clean
refreshing
and
it
hit
the
spot
after
a
full
dinner
and
some
heavier
beers
earlier
in
the
night
the
beer
was
definitely
a
step
up
above
the
bmc
crowd
and
a
really
nice
affordable
option
to
have
late
in
the
night
when
youve
already
had
5
beers
previously
d
very
smooth
and
light
overall
so
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
multiple
in
a
sitting
would
not
be
the
unreasonable
in
the
least
following
the
crack
glug
i
was
looking
at
a
fingerandahalf
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
medium
retention
it
was
fading
but
not
as
quickly
as
its
rheingold
brother
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
yow
but
this
was
brighter
than
bright
nose
was
pretty
standard
for
the
style
a
lager
sweetness
overlain
by
all
of
the
adjuncts
that
they
could
throw
into
the
kettle
move
along
folks
nothing
new
here
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
fairly
pleasant
sweetness
on
the
tongue
frankly
this
was
much
better
than
what
i
had
in
a
bottle
i
have
noted
this
in
a
number
of
previous
clinkers
reinforcing
my
preference
for
canned
beer
finish
was
also
pleasant
slightly
refreshing
not
too
bad
now
would
i
take
up
cooler
space
with
this
it
would
really
depend
on
pricing
if
it
was
as
competitively
priced
as
it
is
in
bottles
then
yes

and
support
local
businesses
and
the
aroma
leads
one
to
believe
that
its
going
to
taste
the
same
the
first
taste
is
light
with
bubbles
dancing
no
real
descernable
flavors
perhaps
some
corn
and
a
little
hops
at
the
end
but
otherwise
nothing
i
did
notice
despite
the
lack
of
flavor
this
is
extremely
unique
i
am
not
sure
what
they
are
going
for
with
this
beer
meh
okay
summer
beer
but
nothing
special
at
all
on
draft
at
one
of
my
favorite
haunts
never
seen
it
and
asked
ahead
of
time
if
it
was
any
good
should
have
steered
clear
based
on
the
barmaids
response
maybe
it
will
get
better
with
this
big
plate
of
nachos
that
im
about
to
eat
but
i
doubt
it
ill
be
switching
up
after
this
one
a
better
version
of
corona
this
is
just
ok
id
get
it
over
a
bud
light
or
something
all
day
thats
about
it
though
one
of
my
favorite
beers
what
sucks
is
winter
time
no
one
buys
it
so
it
just
sits
on
shelves
but
summertime
one
of
the
best
beers
people
waste
money
in
corona
or
expensive
terrible
mexican
beers
this
island
style
lager
is
very
smooth
and
light
so
goes
great
with
any
food
also
12
pack
is
12
not
too
bad
one
of
the
better
terrible
beers
out
there
landshark
incorporates
a
plethora
of
flavor
ensuring
an
infusion
of
fruity
scents
and
tastes
the
only
problem
is
that
it
tastes
like
a
fruity
version
of
a
mainstream
american
light
lager
i
was
drinking
a
ton
of
this
stuff
when
it
was
in
cans
in
my
area
used
to
be
my
lawnmower
beer
cooler
on
the
mower
full
of
ice
cold
landshark
cans
wasnt
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
by
far
cant
see
myself
picking
them
up
in
bottles
for
no
real
reason
though
this
is
a
perfect
lager
for
a
hot
sumers
day
or
just
sitting
around
the
house
when
this
first
came
out
i
kind
of
liked
it
being
a
juvenile
in
my
beer
palate
and
definitely
preferring
it
to
a
corona
still
do
it
has
less
of
the
chemical
off
flavors
of
the
other
large
scale
island
lagers
and
is
really
pretty
easy
drinking
so
yellow
and
bright
and
clear
it
almost
looks
to
have
a
green
tint
in
some
lights
and
while
its
real
well
carbonated
and
cant
hold
much
head
its
smell
is
its
worst
feature
to
me
adjuncty
and
sweet
but
the
flavor
is
better
it
drinks
clean
and
there
is
no
residual
weirdness
or
metallic
tang
to
it
at
all
the
carbonation
is
outstanding
and
the
refreshment
value
is
high
when
its
cold
but
the
clear
bottles
lend
to
skunking
quickly
and
if
yours
isnt
real
fresh
its
probably
terrible
i
like
the
marketing
i
like
having
an
alternative
to
corona
for
that
purpose
but
for
some
reason
this
beer
gives
me
brutal
hangovers
i
can
drink
imperial
ipa
all
night
but
three
of
these
and
im
in
trouble
in
the
morning
not
sure
what
does
that
terrible
crap
aimed
at
jimmy
buffet
fans
proving
that
saturating
the
market
with
advertising
can
sell
anything
coronaish
kind
of
taste
i
tried
it
once
wouldnt
buy
it
again
just
another
horrible
beer
hahaha
well
this
is
a
decent
lager
for
chugging
and
enjoying
with
friends
and
family
winter
blues
making
me
dream
of
warmer
weather
and
i
just
really
enjoy
the
freshness
and
light
feel
of
his
beer
in
the
summer
bad
even
for
an
aal
sweet
and
pretty
gross
this
beer
is
one
of
the
worst
i
have
ever
had
overall
i
like
this
better
than
corona
it
might
be
closer
to
sol
lager
than
corona
i
enjoyed
it
and
the
price
was
6
47
a
sixer
at
walmart
it
is
finally
at
a
reasonable
price
point
for
this
type
of
beer
my
bottle
says
brewery
is
located
in
st
louis
mo
not
jacksonville
fl
yup
did
is
a
good
beer
extremely
disappointed
in
this
beer
weak
in
flavor
and
consistency
ill
stick
to
corona
i
expected
better
from
anything
associated
with
jimmy
buffett
overall
this
could
almost
pass
for
water
it
is
only
useful
for
fighting
off
dehydration
this
beer
is
pretty
good
jimmy
buffett
should
stick
to
doing
thing
he
does
well
wait
i
guess
that
is
only
making
money
nice
light
aroma
not
too
strong
of
an
after
taste
good
stuff
o
i
shouldnt
complain
much
about
free
beer
but
i
wish
i
didnt
have
two
more
of
these
its
decent
and
its
passable
but
theres
much
better
lagers
out
there
overall
3
83
i
desperately
wanted
to
trash
this
beer
because
i
hate
how
much
publicity
landshark
gets
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
horrible
a
drain
pour
even
but
honestly
its
better
than
most
of
the
macros
out
there
by
a
nose
and
it
seems
to
be
readily
available
and
cheap
to
purchase
its
not
amazing
but
heck
it
does
the
trick
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
with
a
burger
a
dog
or
by
itself
on
a
hot
afternoon
had
this
at
a
backyard
wedding
this
weekend
this
beer
is
marketed
as
if
it
were
some
craft
version
of
corona
it
tastes
better
than
corona
but
thats
not
saying
much
the
best
thing
that
i
can
say
about
this
offering
is
that
it
is
unionmade
not
even
worth
trying
you
can
get
better
beers
for
less
cash
money
not
well
spent
tastes
good
nice
and
refreshing
its
light
i
like
light
beer
because
i
like
how
refreshing
it
is
ice
cold
i
dont
like
drinking
something
heavy
in
the
sun
this
is
perfect
for
fishing
or
bbq
or
a
hot
day
believe
it
or
not
i
like
the
adjunct
style
i
may
not
like
the
bmc
adjunct
lagers
anymore
but
i
like
high
quality
adjuncts
this
is
light
and
sometimes
thats
just
what
is
needed
pours
a
nice
golden
color
i
like
looking
at
this
beer
in
a
pilsner
glass
bought
one
today
and
this
looks
nice
in
it
its
kind
of
low
in
complexity
but
lagers
for
the
most
part
are
or
at
least
so
ive
noticed
this
is
good
it
beats
bud
light
anyday
good
smooth
overall
pleasant
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
its
ordinary
but
contains
nothing
foul
or
offputting
o
one
of
the
poorer
adjunct
lagers
to
be
avoided
this
beer
is
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
sorta
like
a
corona
color
it
smells
great
and
taste
similar
to
a
light
beer
mixed
with
corona
its
really
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
could
drink
this
easily
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
with
a
nice
meal
its
not
a
heavy
beer
so
its
perfect
for
me
landshark
lager
was
a
lightbodied
disappointment
and
yes
i
actually
had
some
solid
expectations
ostensibly
i
was
expecting
something
of
a
lighter
lager
with
tones
of
flavorful
lime
and
refreshing
hops
something
i
could
easily
down
on
one
of
these
summer
nights
unfortunately
this
is
one
of
the
most
unremarkable
beers
ive
tried
in
a
while
the
flavor
is
indicative
of
extreme
amounts
of
corn
and
cheap
grains
so
much
so
that
the
margarittaville
brewing
company
label
couldnt
be
further
from
an
idea
of
what
the
final
product
actually
tastes
like
it
is
beyond
and
bland
and
almost
entirely
tasteless
outside
of
overpowering
corn
to
make
matters
worse
my
bottle
wasnt
as
chilled
as
it
couldve
been
which
proved
bad
for
about
the
first
nine
or
ten
ounces
but
detrimental
and
nearly
undrinkable
for
the
remaining
two
or
so
for
the
brewing
companys
bestselling
most
mainstream
beer
its
surely
a
miserably
tasteless
and
needless
offering
the
taste
is
unspectacular
with
its
grainy
malts
and
modest
sweetness
ends
clean
reasonably
refreshing
but
overall
pretty
basic
and
boring
hot
weather
lawn
mower
beer
the
land
shark
was
a
really
good
beer
i
had
it
on
vacation
once
and
i
liked
it
a
lot
you
can
tell
that
it
is
a
lager
by
the
taste
of
the
beer
i
liked
the
taste
of
it
and
how
smooth
it
was
when
you
drank
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
smells
really
good
as
well
it
is
not
too
strong
or
too
weak
landshark
is
essentially
all
american
lagers
on
steroids
pours
a
light
tan
color
with
a
1234
inch
that
sticks
around
smells
malty
tastes
malty
with
mild
hoppiness
moderate
lacing
bitter
aftertaste
i
will
be
buying
this
beer
again
because
it
is
clearly
the
best
american
lager
ive
ever
had
eric
o
not
much
for
taste
but
very
refreshing
after
a
long
day
overall
its
a
decent
summer
beer
for
the
warm
muggy
evenings
drinkable
and
cheap
overall
the
more
i
dissect
each
individual
part
of
this
beers
profile
the
worse
it
gets
enjoyed
41214
at
my
daughters
birthday
party
servied
in
a
long
neck
bottle
with
a
lime
wedge
similar
in
appearance
to
corona
but
no
skunky
aroma
taste
has
no
off
flavors
as
well
slightly
malty
and
lime
flavor
of
course
mouthfeel
is
thin
bodied
and
lower
carbonation
than
average
for
the
style
overall
its
just
a
smooth
easy
drinking
lager
that
fit
well
with
the
scene
and
great
weather
its
very
lightill
give
it
that
good
for
massconsumption
at
an
outdoor
concert
but
whereas
corona
can
hold
up
as
being
relatively
flavorless
as
a
refreshing
summery
beer
this
one
has
that
extra
aftertaste
of
metallic
unpleasantness
that
really
makes
this
beer
a
smart
one
to
miss
dont
bother
nothing
too
amazing
to
report
basically
a
corona
with
different
packaging
smell
and
taste
were
a
bit
skunky
and
it
was
light
in
both
mouthfeel
and
appearance
its
popular
due
to
availability
and
price
and
maybe
a
little
from
buffet
recognition
overall
you
could
pass
this
one
by
and
not
really
miss
anything
my
favorite
summer
beer
a
bit
over
priced
but
worth
it
to
me
this
is
drinkable
but
a
notch
below
other
beers
of
this
type
like
modelo
especial
and
corona
i
wouldnt
buy
it
out
of
my
money
but
it
is
decent
enough
to
drink
if
its
free
o
this
beer
isnt
very
flavorful
but
it
does
manage
to
have
a
slight
amount
of
bitterness
to
mask
any
sweetness
from
the
malts
while
not
very
exciting
it
is
rather
drinkable
light
yellow
urine
color
in
a
clear
bottle
almost
no
head
or
lacing
it
smells
a
lot
like
corona
tastes
like
it
too
its
a
little
sweeter
than
corona
leaves
a
corny
aftertaste
thats
a
little
sour
its
a
pretty
bad
beer
its
not
like
i
would
turn
it
down
if
it
was
the
last
beer
left
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
at
least
not
on
purpose
overall
well
nothing
too
exciting
or
exceptional
here
an
alright
brew
for
tailgating
or
other
activities
where
you
really
wont
appreciate
what
you
are
drinking
but
if
you
want
something
more
for
flavordeliciousness
then
you
may
want
to
pass
on
this
one
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
landshark
is
available
all
year
round
but
should
primarily
be
drank
in
the
summer
it
can
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
better
than
corona
since
you
dont
need
to
add
a
lime
to
it
originally
had
on
tap
in
key
west
in
margaritaville
but
better
out
of
a
bottle
created
for
the
beach
and
a
lime
this
lager
is
not
meant
for
straight
drinking
and
it
should
not
be
i
have
an
intense
disdain
for
jimmy
buffet
and
everything
that
he
stands
for
and
i
really
wanted
to
hate
this
beer
as
well
unfortunately
for
me
it
seemed
pretty
decent
for
the
style
this
might
not
be
a
bad
beer
to
have
at
the
beach
on
a
hot
day
then
again
there
are
so
many
better
options
out
there
i
really
wanted
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
the
first
whiff
of
skunky
aroma
turned
me
off
right
away
nothing
special
about
it
exept
for
the
marketing
who
wouldnt
want
a
landshark
advertising
surfboard
i
will
not
be
buying
it
again
add
a
little
lime
to
it
to
make
it
palatable
for
the
summer
o
thank
goodness
for
mixed
6ers
i
could
not
drink
another

light
looking
beer
had
this
with
dinner
at
cheeseburger
in
paradise
this
went
well
with
dinner
slight
foam
goes
down
smooth
could
really
drink
several
of
these
no
bad
aftertaste
not
filling
i
hope
they
come
out
with
possibly
darker
versions
of
this
beer
or
different
variations
a
little
more
hoppy
taste
would
be
good
d
drinkable
enough
it
is
refreshing
this
is
ok
for
the
style
ive
also
had
this
on
tap
and
thought
it
was
better
than
bottled
bottled
version
is
better
than
the
average
supermarket
lawnmower
beer
but
not
by
much
will
i
buy
it
probably
not
for
me
but
its
a
good
thing
to
have
around
for
buddies
who
like
budweiser
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
high
carbonation
aroma
is
grainy
and
corny
with
a
touch
of
something
hops
flavor
is
bland
and
lightly
grainy
density
is
light
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
not
much
to
the
brew
to
be
offensive
but
not
much
there
to
rate
either
sold
in
a
a
clear
bottle
but
even
the
particles
found
in
light
stay
away
from
this
beer
d
i
had
to
check
the
label
again
because
it
seemed
like
an
average
light
beer
but
really
is
not
d
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
its
not
offensive
just
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
alcohol
is
well
lets
just
say
i
had
to
check
to
see
if
it
was
na
beer
taste
didnt
improve
with
warmth
overall
this
is
a
below
average
beer
i
thought
the
taste
was
lacking
in
every
aspect
other
than
being
a
drinkable
beer
not
much
here
was
at
a
restaurant
without
any
beer
selection
so
this
was
the
only
new
beer
to
try
this
looks
like
the
typical
yellow
fizzy
lager
head
dies
down
fairly
quickly
no
lacing
at
all
bland
macro
lager
smell
and
flavour
carbonation
was
so
high
which
made
this
hard
to
drink
ill
never
have
again
i
would
drink
this
in
the
future
if
offered
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
especially
for
7
50
sixpack
maybe
if
it
was
a
1
50
i
bought
this
beer
on
mistake
not
much
to
say
here
just
another
corona
from
a
different
brand
it
is
a
flavorless
beer
perfect
for
those
who
love
the
mainstream
beers
like
miller
light
and
bud
light
you
actually
have
to
put
a
lime
in
the
bottle
to
give
it
any
flavor
at
all
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
and
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
out
there
jimmy
buffett
knows
his
market
summer
pounder
beer
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
this
beer
along
with
red
stripe
corona
are
way
overpriced
for
the
style
of
beer
you
can
buy
a
comparable
rolling
rock
for
12
the
price
if
i
spend
9
a
six
pack
im
buying
a
craftbrew
with
high
quality
ingredients
not
this
type
of
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
beerit
reminds
me
of
red
stripe
and
the
other
beers
from
jamaicatrinidad
a
little
cirtrus
reminds
of
the
caribbean
nice
light
color
tangy
crisp
a
very
drinkable
beer
easy
to
have
a
second
i
have
mostly
found
it
at
stadiums
in
dc
and
new
jersey
and
it
is
reliably
tasty
and
tangy
i
choose
it
above
most
others
drinkability
i
guess
so
if
its
hot
on
a
beach
perhaps
in
iowa
would
go
along
nicely
with
the
corn
fields
bordering
the
beaches
there
d
easily
kill
a
six
pack
in
the
situations
that
i
drank
it
it
was
drinkable
i
cant
say
this
is
one
that
id
come
back
to
but
if
forced
to
choose
between
adjunct
lagers
one
could
do
worse
poured
in
a
pilsenerbayern
glass
look
bright
golden
color
creamy
and
thick
foamy
head
but
quickly
disappeared
leaving
nothing
smell
fresh
corn
and
cooked
vegetables
taste
almost
zero
but
some
corn
and
root
essences
mouthfeel
very
clean
damper
thirst
mild
bitterness
and
extra
soft
body
almost
watery
drinkability
not
bad
first
quencher
nothing
else
to
say
i
like
this
particular
beer
during
a
summertime
setting
or
a
chill
night
like
it
says
on
the
bottle
its
an
island
style
lager
which
makes
sense
cause
this
is
the
type
of
lager
you
would
want
to
drink
while
on
the
white
sands
of
a
caribbean
island
looks
like
every
other
adjunct
ever
straw
color
thin
white
head
smells
like
nothing
virtually
no
smell
maybe
a
little
corn
or
a
little
rice
some
sort
of
adjunct
tastes
like
corn
with
a
little
sweet
malt
with
a
hop
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
awfully
thin
like
most
in
its
class
drinkability
is
a
complete
joke
another
beer
for
the
people
lost
in
the
abyss
not
the
beer
of
mass
market
beer
when
i
poured
the
beer
into
my
pint
glass
it
had
very
little
head
to
it
on
top
of
a
pale
yellow
color
body
the
smell
is
light
of
corn
and
little
bit
of
hops
it
has
a
nice
light
taste
to
it
which
goes
down
smooth
nice
mouth
feel
to
it
and
i
think
is
very
drinkable
for
a
summer
time
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
but
once
in
a
while
it
would
be
good
so
sad
targeting
the
vast
market
of
parrot
heads
riding
the
wave
of
buffett
escapism
visions
of
kicking
back
on
the
beach
with
just
enough
corona
overtones
to
complete
the
image
of
the
perfect
beach
beer
how
nice
if
this
had
turned
out
to
be
a
nice
crisp
lager
rather
than
vault
the
corona
bar
this
beer
slinks
just
below
it
rough
corn
adjunct
flavor
watery
body
and
flat
hops
finish
requires
a
lime
to
be
palatable
i
guess
that
was
what
they
were
going
for
poured
with
a
surprising
good
head
of
dense
bubbles
of
wedding
white
head
started
at
three
fingers
but
fizzled
down
to
a
donut
looking
covering
lace
slides
down
the
side
of
the
glass
as
fast
as
it
is
placed
this
brew
presents
a
very
light
amber
color
rating
a
srm
3
on
the
beer
color
chart
the
beer
smells
like
wet
straw
and
a
breeze
of
sweet
malt
tastes
much
like
it
smells
malt
corn
and
just
a
little
lime
very
little
feeling
in
the
mouth
watery
and
little
else
heard
this
was
quite
good
but
i
wouldnt
serve
this
to
those
who
like
a
flavorful
beer
but
still
it
is
a
bit
better
than
most
domestics
light
bodied
thin
and
watery
no
need
to
try
this
again
avoid
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
youre
having
a
barbecue
or
sitting
by
the
pool
it
is
light
and
refreshing
and
it
goes
down
easy
it
has
a
light
golden
color
similar
to
corona
it
has
a
citrusy
lemony
smell
and
taste
it
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
without
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
3
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
would
prefer
this
beer
over
any
other
tropical
beers
that
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
simple
decent
beer
that
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
fancy
overall
not
really
sure
what
just
happened
soo
light
it
was
almost
mistaken
for
water
and
i
should
have
ordered
a
tea
to
be
honest
this
i
consider
a
summer
beer
goes
down
easy
with
a
splash
of
lime
or
lemon
to
really
spice
it
up
add
a
shot
of
tequila
i
drink
this
as
an
alternative
to
corona
when
dont
feel
like
drinking
really
expensive
beers
it
hits
the
spot
every
now
and
then
especially
on
the
beach
or
by
the
pool
a
great
and
easy
drinking
beer
in
the
summer
and
dreams
of
hot
weather
in
the
fall
and
winter
it
is
a
lot
fresher
then
most
mexico
beers
i
love
it
i
dont
care
who
makes
the
beer
and
that
should
not
matter
it
comes
in
6
packs
and
12
pack
bottles
i
wish
it
came
in
cans
dwell
theyre
easy
to
drink
but
thats
about
it
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
crappy
corona
it
is
generic
in
just
about
every
way
you
might
as
well
buy
bud
light
instead
anyway
its
a
decent
summer
beer
thats
nothing
special
but
impressed
those
at
my
recent
barbecue
who
didnt
know
better
its
got
more
panache
then
a
rolling
rock
thanks
to
smart
marketing
itll
leave
your
guests
thinking
better
of
you
than
if
you
loaded
the
cooler
with
keystone
ice
taste
is
better
than
one
might
imagine
actually
not
too
bad
of
an
aal
very
clean
with
just
a
mild
graininess
and
thats
about
it
one
of
the
least
flavorful
nonlight
lagers
i
have
ever
had
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
considering
that
is
what
they
were
going
for
ive
spent
two
dollars
on
much
worse
than
this
d
i
couldnt
even
finish
half
this
beer
maybe
im
spoiled
by
belgians
but
this
is
just
bad
the
approach
to
an
island
style
lager
seems
to
be
to
make
it
taste
sweet
but
more
than
this
does
a
beer
need
the
only
good
thing
about
landshark
is
the
shark
fins
embossed
in
the
bottle
overall
a
bad
beer
lets
face
it
its
popular
due
to
jimmy
buffetts
involvement
brown
bottles
might
help
too
not
recommended
this
is
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
usual
skunkfests
from
mexico
and
the
caribbean
but
when
youre
looking
up
from
the
bottom
rung
theres
still
a
long
way
to
go
til
daylight
d
easy
to
drink
especially
if
youre
more
a
strongbeer
drinker
at
a
bbq
or
a
get
together
i
would
easily
reach
for
this
one
in
the
cooler
not
too
bad
it
is
what
it
is
i
prefer
this
to
most
mexican
or
island
beers
somehow
it
doesnt
have
the
formers
typical
skunkyness
overall
for
what
it
is
landshark
is
a
decent
brew
its
ok
would
choose
it
equally
amongst
corona
or
similar
beers
if
nothing
else
was
available
but
thats
about
it
dont
plan
to
buy
again
this
was
pretty
much
an
ok
summer
beer
good
with
hot
weather
and
a
bbq
what
i
had
with
it
its
plenty
drinkable
with
no
foul
tastes
and
a
low
alcohol
content
but
i
definitely
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
its
got
a
cool
name
but
that
cant
save
this
beer
i
partook
of
this
beer
over
at
a
friends
house
i
thought
the
name
of
the
beer
was
intriguing
as
it
reminded
me
of
my
ultimate
frisbee
days
in
college
but
like
the
ultimate
frisbee
landshark
this
beer
was
also
rather
unimpressive
the
beer
poured
clear
and
golden
there
was
a
head
right
after
the
pour
but
it
completely
disappeared
after
a
few
short
moments
leaving
a
rather
unimpressive
glass
the
beer
had
little
flavour
i
think
the
only
way
to
enjoy
this
one
is
to
get
a
nice
cold
glass
and
drink
after
a
hard
workout
making
it
more
of
a
replenishing
fluid
than
a
beer
this
isnt
a
world
beating
lager
by
any
standards
but
it
was
an
ideal
thirst
quencher
and
my
notes
told
me
to
give
in
an
overal
score
of
around
4
so
i
have
this
light
beer
has
all
the
attributes
of
a
classic
lager
pale
golden
appearance
and
an
easygoing
flavor
profile
thats
more
on
the
malty
side
the
clean
crisp
taste
compares
more
than
favorably
to
corona
so
summer
beer
fans
looking
for
a
light
and
tasty
alternative
to
the
more
mainstream
light
beers
should
find
landshark
ultimately
satisfying
i
say
give
this
one
a
chance
you
may
be
pleasantly
surprised

in

of
being
in

and
had
a

overall
this
was
a

pale
lager
there
wasnt
much
to
enjoy
in
the
scent

taste
or
body
it
was
at

light
and
crisp
for
summer
drinking
and

high
carbonation

the

is
similar
to

theres
really
nothing
special

unique
about
it
i

the

about

absolutely
one

i
have
had
i
really
cant

the
horrid

had
i

that
this
was
just
a
weird
bottle
and
they
wouldnt
vend
something
like
this
not

it
isnt
the
worst
and
it

does
beat

as
a

line
etc
i
ignored
the
fact
that
the
color
looked
almost
artificial
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
but
as
for
me
someone
could
swill
these
back
and
not
get
buzzed
but
if
youre
at
a
bar
and
the
best
value
for
your
buck
is
a
bucket
of
these
or
something
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
but
not
much
taste
is
ok
for
the
style
lemon
and
peppery
hops
the
flavor
is
of
club
soda
with
a
sweet
tint
light
to
mediumbodied
with
lively
carbonation
short
that
this
beer
is
not
worthwhile
white
head
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
with
white
head
nothing
really
stands
out
but
its
really
nothing
special
i
would
gladly
drink
a
few
of
these
corona
killers
on
a
scorching
day
at
the
beach
taste
pretty
refreshing
and
a
step
above
corona
still
slightly
weak
but
the
lemon
flavor
adds
at
least
something
to
the
brew
would
go
well
on
the
beach
which
is
what
its
designed
to
do
i
could
put
away
a
whole
case
of
these
easily
if
nothing
else
ill
buy
it
to
avoid
the
big

pretty
solid
beer
not
much
different
from
a
budweiser
in
all
honesty
pours
a
piss
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
not
much
lacing
on
the
glass
taste
is
refreshing
with
a
pretty
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
citrus
overtones
a
dry
finish
to
which
i
could
detect
a
little
banana
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
have
poolside
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
something
that
will
bowl
anyone
over
but
it
serves
its
purpose
drinkability
one
of
the
most
drinkable
and
refreshing
beers
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
sample
this
beer
reminded
me
of
corona
brewed
in
fl
nothing
more
a
yard
beer
and
not
much
more
i
could
and
did
drink
this
while
doing
work
outside
in
the
heat
and
humidity
d
a
okay
brew
it
would
work
fine
as
a
session
or
landmower
beer
cant
say
that
i
didnt
see
this
comming
a
local
offering
to
central
ky
i
figured
it
was
worth
a
try
pours
a
standard
lager
straw
color
with
sparkling
clarity
high
carbonation
and
a
bleachwhite
head
retention
that
falls
somewhere
between
fizzy
and
frothy
smells
light
but
sweetly
of
partmalt
partadjuct
giving
a
moderate
grain
and
vegetable
aroma
flavors
closely
mimic
the
aromas
with
a
grain
malt
combo
corn
flavors
are
quite
pronounced
along
with
a
buttery
note
that
cant
be
overlooked
body
is
quite
firm
but
riddled
with
adjuct
sweetness
and
oily
finishes
quite
clean
with
the
same
vegetable
flavor
that
never
disipated
probably
more
comparable
to
budweiser
than
corona
but
more
problematic
unless
its
free
ill
likely
pass
this
one
up
in
future
sessions
notes
you
have
to
give
some
credit
to
this
beer
for
being
brewed
to
the
restaurant
for
a
big
chains
rest
with
their
own
beernice
disappears
pretty
quickly
seemingly
somewhat
refreshing
in
the
heat
not
terrible
for
the
style
had
worse
not
worth
craft
beer
price
gimmicky
okay
for
style
though
not
the
best
there
either
soapiness
is
a
bit
annoying
if
buffet
has
anything
to
do
with
this
beer
at
least
this
beach
brew
dont
come
with
the
lemonlime
already
added
like
some
of
late
i
didnt
like
it
too
much
this
would
go
great
with
one
of
the
burgers
at
his
cheesburger
in
paradise
restaurants
it
wont
distract
from
the
margaritaville
songs
thatll
be
played
and
the
sourdough
on
the
burgers
has
a
similar
taste
to
it
than
the
back
of
this
beer
as
much
as
i
hate
to
say
this
this
is
not
the
brew
that
id
want
to
be
wasting
away
to
while
in
margaritaville
parrotheads
youve
been
warned
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
one
hot
north
carolina
evening
after
work
my
partnerintasting
pit
said
that
it
reminded
her
of
budweiser
only
with
a
little
more
flavor
wow
that
is
really
depressing
it
looks
and
feels
very
much
like
corona
to
me
its
light
and
refreshing
with
little
discernable
flavor
and
a
white
foamy
head
the
finish
is
at
least
yeasty
giving
it
a
small
bit
of
bread
flavor
nothing
much
to
say
i
suppose
its
representative
of
its
style
drank
straight
from
bottle
color
is
yellowy
almost
like
when
its
expelled
with
a
little
foam
lacing
around
the
bottle
smelled
yeasty
kinda
like
white
bread
doesnt
have
much
flavor
slightly
bitter
left
white
rice
flavors
in
the
mouth
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
not
too
thin
tasted
better
slightly
warm
than
cold
didnt
hit
the
spot
so
not
really
drinkable
overall
impession
tastes
quite
a
bit
like
corona
but
without
the
usual
skunk
not
great
but
it
serves
its
purpose
well
typical
macro
lager
with
a
twist
they
must
have
added
liquid
detergent
at
the
time
of
bottling
instead
of
lime
juice
after
three
drinks
all
i
could
comment
to
my
friends
is
soap
i
should
end
this
review
here
but
i
will
go
on
i
should
back
up
actually
the
appearance
and
smell
are
pretty
much
exactly
what
you
expect
from
a
light
lager
the
interesting
thing
is
that
the
body
did
not
feel
light
actually
pretty
full
after
getting
a
few
more
drinks
down
i
had
build
a
tolerance
up
to
the
soap
flavor
and
in
conclusion
i
wil
say
this
is
more
drinkable
than
any
other
mass
brewed
light
lager
i
have
tried
but
one
i
will
not
partake
of
again
pours
a
five
finger
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
clear
pale
yellowgreen
color
low
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
stale
water
nose
flavor
is
sweet
corn
with
hops
in
background
not
very
beer
like
good
lawn
mower
beer

for

12oz

nh
i
remember
hearing
a
david
allen
coe
song
making
fun
of
jimmy
buffett
jimmy
buffett
doesnt
live
in
key
west
anymore
im
wondering
if
he
could
make
a
better
beer
i
should
have
known
i
was
in
trouble
when
the
bartender
kind
of
chuckled
as
i
ordered
this
and
immediately
asked
lime
i
turned
it
down
and
wish
i
hadnt
it
wouldve
helped
there
was
nothing
beyond
corn
otherwise
not
that
i
put
lime
in
my
corn
mind
you
but
hell
anything
wouldve
improved
this
i
was
so
so
disappointed
i
wasnt
expecting
the
world
from
a
light
lager
but
come
on
seriously
libbys
should
sue
id
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
md
smooth
and
drinkable
easy
down
i
bet
in
margaritaville
it
sells
pretty
good
i
could
see
drinking
this
on
a
hot
day
beneath
a
palm
tree
on
the
beach
in
the
keys
like
those
corona
commercials
of
course
i
would
rather
drink
nearly
anything
else
like
water
ive
heard
this
compared
to
corona
so
i
went
into
the
taste
test
expecting
to
reach
for
a
lime
what
i
found
however
was
something
much
more
nothing
to
look
at
in
the
glass
except
for
longer
head
retention
than
i
expected
nice
clear
golden
color
with
bubbles
streaming
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
not
much
in
the
nose
except
a
hint
of
not
skunk
or
hops
but
malt
surprisingly
full
moderately
full
anyway
mouthfeel
with
pleasant
carbonation
and
some
foam
on
the
lip
fairly
decent
bready
malt
flavor
with
not
much
bitterness
to
speak
of
thankfully
nothing
like
corona
and
while
nothing
to
write
home
about
in
the
complexity
department
i
enjoyed
the
rich
simplicity
of
the
taste
and
the
buttery
slickness
of
the
malt
id
definitely
buy
this
againespecially
for
a
bbq
party
on
the
deck
and
yes
i
may
try
a
lime
the
bottle
after
all
has
a
nice
coronastyle
neck
that
would
work
very
well
for
that
really
worth
trying
i
hope
it
catches
on
a
nice
craftbrewed
alternative
to
corona
would
be
welcome
when
out
on
the
town
i
poured
this
overpriced
beer
into
a
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
beer
color
very
light
straw
golden
the
beer
had
a
nice
head
with
good
lacing
a
little
bready
tasting
maybe
but
really
nothing
outatanding
it
is
a
great
hot
weather
beer
i
will
buy
again
this
just
isnt
my
style
but
id
take
it
over
bmc
certainly
not
worth
the
craft
beer
price
could
have
bought
a
bells
kalamazoo
stout
for
the
same
1
65
instead
but
i
had
to
experiment
d
has
ok
drinkability
good
for
a
hot
day
but
the
adjunct
flavor
turned
me
off
a
bit
too
expensive
7
99
a
sixpack
for
what
it
is
but
i
probably
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
ordered
one
of
these
in
margaritaville
in
myrtle
beach
had
to
try
something
new
after
a
tooweak
margarita
odorless
like
most
beers
in
its
class
carbonated
and
crisp
taste
a
little
less
bitter
than
a
corona
or
a
bud
but
not
much
different
drinkable
with
a
lime
but
not
really
worth
the
8
for
a
6pack
that
i
found
the
next
day
at
the
local
grocery
store
buffett
is
the
luckiest
man
on
earth
being
able
to
market
his
brand
in
so
many
ways
but
hes
obviously
not
too
passionate
about
his
beer
overall
a
beach
beer
bland
but
easy
enough
to
drink
clear
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
faint
whiff
of
grain
and
nothing
much
in
the
are
of
hops
the
taste
is
cheap
macro
lager
that
is
borderline
offensive
no
thank
you
i
did
not
enjoy
this
one
at
all
it
tastes
like
a
cheap
version
of
budweiser
in
fact
i
kept
inspecting
the
label
to
see
any
signs
of
it
being
an
ab
product
because
it
was
so
reminiscent
of
budweiser
there
is
no
indication
on
the
label
but
after
logging
onto
ba
it
was
confirmed
that
ab
does
make
this
not
recommended
not
very
drinkable
just
dont
care
for
it
overall
i
dont
know
how
much
alcohol
it
has
in
it
but
i
find
it
tastes
and
feels
like
a
light
malt
liquor
i
dont
think
it
has
all
that
much
alchohol
in
it
but
it
suprisingly
fills
my
mouth
up
more
than
i
would
expect
or
would
want
on
a
hot
day
on
the
beach
great
packaging
clear
embossed
bottle
shark
fin
on
the
shoulder
with
clear
pressure
sensitive
labels
and
a
retro
looking
design
and
color
scheme
this
is
obviously
designed
to
compete
with
corona
but
does
it
really
need
to
regardless
it
looks
great
in
the
glass
as
well
its
clear
and
golden
with
a
finger
of
creamy
bright
white
foam
across
the
the
top
the
head
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
minor
lacing
about
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweetly
malty
with
some
grain
and
an
adjunct
side
and
a
suggestion
of
alcohol
and
some
grassy
hops
in
the
background
it
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
and
to
be
honest
its
not
that
different
from
corona
medium
bodied
soft
carbonation
i
dont
have
one
to
try
side
by
side
but
the
landshark
seems
a
little
sweeter
its
just
begging
for
a
lime
to
cut
through
it
and
balance
it
out
and
theres
even
a
suggestion
of
lime
flavor
to
it
already
and
i
wonder
if
theres
something
added
for
what
its
intended
to
be
it
hits
the
mark
and
as
to
why
its
what
its
intended
to
be
well
thats
all
about
the
money
pretty
golden
color
with
a
surprisingly
tenacious
bright
white
head
aromas
of
cooked
grains
a
bit
of
a
sulphury
corny
note
and
the
slightest
hint
of
saazish
hops
but
it
doesnt
smell
like
saaz
on
the
tongue
sweet
and
sulphur
notes
pop
up
first
followed
by
a
long
unpleasant
midsection
of
cloying
corn
notes
and
a
soapy
finish
mouthfeel
is
completely
nondescript
overall
this
beer
is
kind
of
sucky
theres
nothing
good
about
it
but
there
are
bad
things
not
a
good
combo
i
dont
understand
the
point
of
making
this
beer
why
not
just
drink
a
bud
bud
is
better
which
is
scary
all
in
all
i
didnt
find
this
to
be
a
terrible
beer
it
looks
about
the
same
as
your
typical
macro
lager
very
similar
to
a
corona
in
fact
smell
is
minimal
and
nothing
special
taste
was
pretty
good
for
a
macro
swill
better
than
corona
in
my
mind
because
it
was
smoother
and
a
little
less
skunky
tasting
mouthfeel
was
light
and
empty
once
you
swallow
it
the
taste
seems
to
exit
quickly
leaving
hardly
anything
on
the
tongue
pretty
good
drinkability
though
nothing
id
want
to
drink
often
very
easy
going
down
but
other
qualities
of
this
beer
keep
it
from
getting
a
4
in
any
respect
an
almost
average
macro
lager
and
better
than
most
that
ive
tried
drunk
straight
from
the
bottle
it
presented
a
light
yellow
colour
a
la
corona
light
i
was
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
flavour
the
second
half
of
the
beer
was
decidedly
bland
it
had
a
thin
taste
and
a
disappointing
lack
of
body
while
not
labeled
as
a
light
beer
i
can
think
of
no
other
way
to
categorize
it
worked
for
drinking
on
the
beach
where
i
was
but
dont
expect
much
outside
of
that
it
did
keep
my
throat
wet
which
was
what
i
was
looking
for
at
the
time
so
i
guess
it
succeeded
in
that
regard
landshark
lager
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
clear
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
very
little
aroma
a
slight
note
of
corn
is
noticeable
however
there
is
a
slight
corn
flavor
but
this
beer
is
really
quite
watery
at
least
its
not
skunky
i
didnt
realize
this
was
a
bud
product
the
bottle
gives
no
indication
what
the
bottle
should
say
is
we
spent
money
on
attractive
graphics
so
dont
expect
much
i
purchased
this
on
vacation
in
tampa
and
found
it
as
close
to
undrinkable
as
anything
ive
ever
had
a
horrible
blend
of
fizz
andgod
only
knows
what
picked
this
up
as
something
i
saw
that
was
new
looked
enticing
bottle
smell
is
very
sweet
and
corny
poured
into
a
glass
with
a
neon
yellow
color
nice
head
taste
is
highly
carbonated
but
without
substance
very
bland
steady
hopped
lager
taste
but
nothing
stands
out
at
the
start
or
finish
thought
this
was
a
microbrew
and
was
tricked
even
reading
all
over
the
package
even
for
a
macrobrew
it
is
in
my
opinion
substandard
i
think
ill
pawn
the
rest
of
the
sixer
off
on
my
friends
hopefully
they
remain
my
friends
ill
be
steering
clear
of
the
landshark
overall
another
pointless
and
boring
macro
lager
been
to
jimmys
restaurant
and
the
food
theres
pretty
good
i
really
expected
something
better
to
go
with
it
i
didnt
expect
much
and
i
didnt
get
a
whole
lot
from
this
beer
avoid
unless
you
absolutely
love
corona
put
in
a
lime
to
hide
some
of
the
bad
tastes
and
smells
of
this
beer
oh
yeah
the
beer
well
lets
see
lifeless
yellow
ochre
big
white
head
that
instantly
evaporates
to
a
bubble
nasty
adjuncty
nose
with
a
touch
of
fresh
citrus
surprisingly
decent
lace
taste
has
a
bit
of
rice
and
that
typical
macro
light
beer
flavor
but
it
does
go
down
pretty
smooth
definitely
not
recommended
unless
like
me
you
are
drawn
to
the
allure
of
the
packaging
and
moniker
still
better
than
most
mainstream
macros
and
it
surpasses
corona
for
flavor
and
drinkability
so
its
not
totally
terrible
by
any
means
this
just
arrived
in
pcb
like
corona
down
to
the
bottle
marketing
lacks
the
bitterness
that
makes
corona
a
more
slowly
drinking
beer
and
pretty
good
warm
my
novice
girlfriend
noticed
no
difference
to
most
other
beers
i
try
i
agree
with
the
previous
review
that
considering
the
obvious
beachy
appeal
this
should
have
a
citrus
flavor
i
add
lime
ab
could
have
remarketed
tequiza
as
this
and
i
would
have
been
pleasantly
surprised
a
good
beer
for
a
beach
day
or
florida
bbq
but
at
7
006pack
little
reason
to
not
just
get
corona
the
jacksonville
edge
gives
it
a
little
taste
of
the
tropics
but
it
lacks
the
originality
of
the
craft
beer
it
is
meant
to
be
ultimately
it
ranks
with
red
stripe
corona
and
others
as
an
obvious
choice
for
parrotheads
and
other
beachgoers
but
it
is
just
that
a
summery
mood
beer
overall
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
corona
maybe
a
bit
better
a
very
crisp
light
beer
im
guessing
all
the
bad
reviews
are
from
people
who
want
a
bold
slapintheface
taste
to
their
beer
sometimes
you
drink
beer
just
to
get
a
buzz
if
thats
what
youre
after
you
could
do
way
worse
than
rolling
rock
i
would
rank
beers
like
bud
light
coors
light
michelob
light
nattie
light
etc
below
rolling
rock
not
the
worst
beer
i
ever
had
there
are
way
worse
but
really
nothing
special
it
smells
like
glass
which
is
weird
because
on
the
bottle
it
states
that
it
comes
from
the
glass
lined
tanks
of
old
latrobe
the
power
of
suggestion
perhaps
overall
i
like
it
but
certainly
do
not
love
it
a
most
forgettable
ale
wheres
the
flavor
and
feel
there
is
so
little
depth
and
character
that
its
difficult
to
see
why
this
beer
is
still
made
one
is
better
off
with
a
budweiser
or
a
nice
glass
of
ice
water
well
my
wife
goes
for
this
and
i
use
to
settle
for
this
a
few
decades
ago
but
i
see
little
reason
to
go
for
this
beer
if
other
macro
american
adjuncts
are
available
just
checking
off
crappy
beers
i
drank
in
the
past
watery
skunky
cheap
looks
like
a
little
yellow
food
coloring
added
to
seltzer
water
nice
light
pale
air
beer
theres
really
nothing
good
nor
bad
about
the
beer
except
for
the
price
which
imo
makes
it
one
of
the
best
beers
for
the
buck
you
can
get
its
nothing
fancy
has
no
good
taste
nor
bad
no
good
smell
nor
bad
and
gives
you
a
decent
buzz
which
doesnt
hang
around
with
any
nasty
headaches
so
when
i
can
get
an
18
pack
for
12
bucks
its
hard
to
find
a
reason
not
to
when
funds
are
tight
its
no
aventinus
but
i
can
get
2
5
bottles
of
aventinus
for
the
price
of
an
18
pack
of
rolling
rock
one
is
an
everyday
drinker
the
other
is
a
weekend
brew
both
have
merit
great
beer
gets
you
hammered
quick
really
okay
this
beer
has
less
flavor
than
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
is
that
justification
enough
smh
this
was
not
great
we
tasted
this
beer
based
on
a
listeners
recommendation
what
happened
this
used
to
be
a
great
summertime
party
beer
now
it
is
just
lackluster
at
best
i
absolutely
hate
this
beer
it
is
the
wist
of
the
worst
cheap
beers
tastes
of
sweet
corn
and
grain
not
much
else
to
say
very
light
in
color
same
for
smell
flavor
is
on
the
light
side
also
not
much
to
rave
about
but
not
much
to
complain
about
either
low
on
the
abv
light
and
dry
on
the
after
taste
means
its
head
and
shoulders
above
most
aals
very
kind
to
all
the
senses
goes
down
easier
than
lemonade
this
is
a
great
summer
heat
slammer
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
something
about
the
green
bottle
if
you
buy
do
not
let
it
sit
around
long
flavor
changes
drastically
from
bottle
to
bottle
if
you
let
it
stay
in
the
fridge
for
any
extended
time
this
beer
is
an
everyday
drinking
kinda
beer
drink
em
like
pops
i
bought
a
sixpack
of
rolling
rock
last
night
valentines
day
partly
for
nostalgic
reasons
and
also
because
i
just
havent
had
this
in
a
long
long
time
in
fact
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
and
began
to
pour
it
i
noticed
that
it
differed
from
what
i
remembered
from
about
twenty
years
ago
its
a
very
light
pale
straw
color
watery
with
heavy
carbonation
almost
like
seltzer
water
the
taste
is
actually
blander
than
i
remember
too
but
i
do
like
the
dry
aftertaste
its
not
an
awful
beer
but
definitely
nothing
stellar
i
miss
what
it
used
to
be
but
then
again
maybe
my
memory
has
shifted
toward
the
optimistic
spectrum
given
my
youthful
appreciation
of
the
brew
and
also
my
grandpa
loved
this
stuff
when
it
was
brewed
in
pa
all
in
all
an
average
aal
in
every
sense
definitely
better
than
bud
mgd
etc
tasted
very
similar
to
any
other
macrolager

i
have
to
write
this
blast
from
the
past
and
really
smooth
and
easy
going
down
i
dont
care
about
the
head
or
any
foam
i
go
strictly
by
the
buzz
and
taste
it
sets
very
well
the
next
morning
and
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
imho
as
far
as
color
goes
i
dont
like
pale
beers
and
prefer
mahogany
colored
beer
to
me
it
taste
better
than
bud
light
i
do
get
a
corn
tastefor
those
who
like
the
taste
of
corn
try
busch
and
something
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
i
get
no
nasty
after
taste
like
i
do
on
other
brands
it
does
have
a
dry
finish
to
me
for
the
price
and
the
way
it
sets
on
you
the
next
day
i
would
recommend
it
to
friends
that
being
said
there
will
be
those
who
dont
like
it
am
i
a
beer
expert
not
by
any
means
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
my
taste
goes
from
ipa
to
this
give
it
a
chance
i
think
you
will
like
it
great
beer
if
you
want
to
change
it
up
i
usually
drink
heavy
craft
beer
but
rolling
rock
was
a
surprisingly
okay
beer
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
light
beers
granted
it
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
and
is
similar
to
coors
and
bud
but
it
is
an
easy
drinker
for
those
who
do
not
like
the
more
hearty
of
beers
light
refreshing
with
little
flavor
you
can
buy
a
30
pack
of
this
beer
for
13
99
where
i
live
not
bad
at
all
for
the
price
colored
water
horrible
wanted
to
a
accurate
list
of
beers
ive
had
that
the
only
reason
i
reviewed
this
one
dry
and
grainy
like
the
bottle
tho
easy
to
drink
tastes
light
not
very
filling
very
smooth
like
any
premium
beer
who
in
the
world
drinks
this
had
in
bottle
at
a
wedding
in
september
sorry
for
the
late
review
in
a
nutshell
i
didnt
like
it
all
give
me
a
bud
light
pbr
old
milwaukee
miller
high
life
or
just
about
any
other
aal
over
this
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
at
all
wont
choose
to
have
another
one
overall
this
seems
a
reasonably
good
beer
for
what
it
is
intended
to
be
light
refreshing
and
without
any
strong
flavors
also
it
seems
to
me
it
is
better
than
i
remember
some
of
its
competitors
being
easy
to
drink
1012
of
them
and
wake
up
no
worseforthewear
tastes
like
creamed
corn
yuck
great
beer
for
when
you
have
no
money
and
are
depressed
about
your
life
sad
but
true
i
dont
grab
a
rock
im
looking
to
build
a
memorable
craft
beer
experience
i
grab
one
when
i
want
a
casual
adult
bubbly
beverage
im
honestly
not
even
sure
if
its
possible
got
get
drunk
drinking
these
much
less
have
a
night
that
ruins
my
next
morning
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
depends
on
the
price
if
you
find
it
on
special
ok
you
can
give
it
a
try
or
else
not
worth
it
overall
i
poured
this
from
a
can
so
ill
admit
this
scores
better
than
a
skunked
green
bottle
but
its
still
cheap
and
really
bad
this
was
awful
no
flavor
very
light
mouth
feel
a
big
wet
cardboard
flavor
not
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
very
disappointed
this
beer
is
pretty
good
taste
like
heineken
its
fine
ive
drunk
enough
of
this
stuff
to
know
it
is
a
truly
nothing
beer
its
not
bad
but
its
not
very
good
a
regional
adjunct
lager
that
just
wont
die
i
guess
there
are
some
diehards
out
there
that
look
at
rolling
rock
as
their
goto
brew
but
i
have
precious
little
respect
for
this
line
from
the
glasslined
tanks
of
old
latrobe
sounds
like
a
pitch
for
a

it
will
be
very

and
taste
like
corn
lol
and
other
times
it
will
taste
like
stale

it
is
a
smooth
beer
with
a

and

o
not
bad
for
what
it
is
a
good
lawnmowerbbq
beer
that
goes
down
easy
a
better
choice
than
a
light
beer
and
you
cant
argue
with
the
price
thin
and
watery
with
high
carbonation
just
not
a
good
beer
and
the
green
bottle
doesnt
help
at
all
nobody
to
blame
but
the
brewery
for
this
mess
it
took
me
about
4
sips
to
finish
a
can
of
this
after
drinking
2
pints
of
spaten
optimator
its
an
extremely
watery
beer
but
the
price
is
right
i
could
definitely
continuously
put
these
down
even
after
a
day
of
drinking
rolling
rock
is
a
good
alternative
to
an
american
beer
like
budweiser
yet
not
as
feminine
as
drinkin
a
ligh
beer
it
is
light
on
the
palette
the
flavor
is
as
mild
as
the
nearly
clear
color
but
its
got
a
decent
abv
and
would
be
ideal
for
an
informal
social
event
over
fishing
beers
or
other
mass
produced
light
lagers
oi
do
not
recommend
this
beer
if
you
want
adjunct
lager
drink
mgd
maybe
it
was
a
bad
batch
i
dont
know
there
was
not
a
date
on
it
i
did
not
even
finish
the
whole
thing
i
dumped
it
in
the
sink
a
screw
off
cap
to
the
bottle
in
which
i
consumed
straight
the
effervescence
of
this
brew
is
interesting
pale
golden
in
color
with
an
excellent
blend
of
light
herbal
qualities
this
is
a
great
session
beer
that
goes
well
with
barbeques
and
it
is
light
on
the
stomach
in
addition
this
beer
reminds
you
of
an
alcohol
based
perrier
minus
the
bite
of
the
co2
goes
down
smooth
but
allows
for
belching
after
each
bottle
consumed
you
actually
dont
realize
the
alcohol
content
as
it
is
brilliantly
soft
on
the
palate
although
it
is
on
the
sweeter
side
for
the
abv
of
this
brand
a
definite
worthy
try
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
a
12
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps

on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
and
corn
flakes
taste
is
of
grain
corn
flakes
and
some
light
fruity
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
mainly
due
to
the
nice
mouthfeel
and
the
refreshing
quality
this
has
when
served
extremely
cold
i
would
much
rather
drink
this
than
other
beers
of
the
style
given
a
choice
overallfor
a
cheap
beer
rolling
rock
pale
ale
sets
a
bar
that
most
other
discount
brews
fail
to
achieve
that
being
said
however
it
lacks
the
inspiration
and
taste
necessary
to
separate
it
from
the
pack
drinkability
is
relatively
high
but
the
carbonation
inhibits
the
enjoyment
of
this
relatively
simple
yet
consistent
flavor
for
a
discount
beer
rolling
rock
certainly
surpasses
the
competition
but
falls
drastically
short
of
higher
quality
beer
simply
put
if
you
need
something
to
drink
dont
have
that
much
money
but
still
value
your
tastebuds
rolling
rock
extra
pale
is
the
way
to
go
it
leaves
something
to
be
desired
but
not
nearly
as
much
as

it
is
what

crisp
and

first
let
me
say
rr
tastes
different
post
ab
acquisition
the
old
rr
had
a
better
distinct
flavor
ab
rr
has
a
light
straw
color
and
little
head
but
the
beer
is
very
carbonated
smell
is
sour
with
adjunct
dominance
smells
like
a
house
the
day
after
a
large
keg
party
the
taste
is
similar
sour
and
corn
dominant
that
gets
worse
as
you
drink
it
down
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
you
can
pour
it
down
if
desired
overall
rr
now
seems
to
compete
with
the
low
end
of
the
spectrum
ala
beast
natty
etc
wouldnt
want
to
test
the
hangover
factor
on
this
one
20
years
ago
rr
had
a
more
hoppy
malty
flavor
it
is
definitely
hard
to
review
this
beer
i
have
just
recently
tried
this
beer
and
have
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
but
after
further
drinking
i
have
noticed
different
things
about
the
beer
that
can
put
me
off
the
appearance
is
quite
clear
and
no
color
high
carbonation
the
head
is
quick
to
dissipate
and
is
very
thin
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
sweet
somewhat
but
also
dry
the
taste
is
where
it
bothers
me
the
beer
is
called
extra
pale
but
does
not
taste
like
a
pale
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
but
arent
pales
supposed
to
be
a
bit
bitter
the
taste
is
sweet
and
is
very
similar
to
the
aromatic
qualities
of
the
beer
the
taste
does
go
very
well
with
sweet
meats
like
bbq
or
grilled
pork
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
different
from
this
style
of
beer
i
think
it
is
smooth
but
also
dry
o
not
a
great
beer
but
i
still
think
this
one
has
better
flavor
than
the
other
bmcs
out
there
maybe
a
decent
beer
to
session
with
if
you
feel
like
pounding
more
than
2
or
3
down
i
remember
rating
this
before
and
thinking
it
was
gross
perhaps
im
wrong
but
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
this
one
either
way
bad
beer
central
this
one
pours
from
the
green
bottle
a
light
golden
nearly
completely
water
colored
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
and
tastes
like
stale
skunk
maybe
a
bit
of
corn
and
hay
mouthfeel
is
light
and
yet
offensive
with
the
skunky
finish
with
high
carbonation
bad
stuff
here
bud
light
is
a
huge
upgrade
from
this
overall
very
mild
on
most
fronts
not
a
beer
to
go
to
if
looking
for
something
more
flavorful
and
heavy
but
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
after
working
outside
and
needing
something
lighter
and
more
refreshing
o
honestly
for
what
it
is
its
not
too
bad
pretty
cheap
and
a
touch
more
flavor
than
similar
macros
o
served
really
cold
this
beer
is
one
the
reasons
why
i
enjoy
getting
my
haircut
as
much
as
i
do
it
is
not
a
fantastic
beer
but
for
some
reason
it
really
matches
well
with
the
atmosphere
at
the
place
and
is
very
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
nowhere
near
crisp
enough
if
i
am
going
to
drink
something
like
this
it
needs
a
brighter
and
lighter
body
overall
a
decent
lawn
mower
or
tailgating
beer
not
something
id
buy
at
a
bar
but
some
friends
had
a
pitcher
on
the
guy
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
you
can
do
much
better
final
thought
well
i
had
this
after
a
night
of
skating
and
i
downed
it
fairly
quickly
and
easily
but
the
price
wasnt
quite
what
i
wanted
it
to
be
for
what
it
was
all
in
all
its
a
slightly
hoppier
spin
on
the
macro
lager
i
think
rolling
rock
slightly
pale
might
be
a
better
name
for
it
though
a
surprising
amount
of
flavour
though
for
a
4
6
offering
o
meh
a
cheap
buzz
kinda
beer
this
beer
is
barely
drinkablesmells
of
corn
tastes
of
corn
and
finishes
as
a
can
of
corn
i
cant
beleive
that
i
drank
this
beer
in
such
quantities
back
in
the
day
clearly
my
taste
in
beer
has
changed
if
im
in
your
typical
store
scenario
where
the
selection
is
mostly
all
bud
light
miller
light
coors
light
busch
various
ice
varieties
mikes
hard
lemonade
heineken
corona
or
rolling
rock
i
buy
the
rolling
rock
every
time
id
probably
even
choose
it
over
a
small
selection
of
sub
par
craft
beers
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
but
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
the
privilege
to
review
it
i
guess
pours
what
youd
expect
from
an
adjunct
lager
translucent
yellow
has
a
head
momentarily
but
it
quickly
bails
smells
kinda
metallic
with
corn
and
rice
present
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
almost
no
hops
detected
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
shines
however
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
its
nothing
to
get
too
excited
over
but
for
a
cheap
beer
it
gets
the
job
done
o
i
feel
like
i
enjoyed
this
a
little
more
on
tap
previously
but
that
may
be
just
because
it
was
part
of
a
long
drinking
session
its
your
typical
adjunct
lager
that
anyone
taking
the
time
to
do
beer
reviews
online
is
not
going
to
enjoy
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
o
its
a
decent
option
when
choosing
amongst
the
more
inexpensive
beers
the
taste
is
very
neutral
but
it
is
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
othis
is
the
beer
to
take
with
you
on
a
fishing
trip
with
the
guys
it
doesnt
taste
bad
at
all
but
then
again
theres
really
hardly
any
taste
to
it
period
its
very
easy
drinking
and
given
the
right
situation
this
can
be
a
fun
companion
do
id
rather
have
a
bmc
i
could
have
finished
it
but
i
poured
it
down
the
drain
because
lifes
too
short
to
drink
bad
beer
and
i
really
dont
need
these
extra
calories
24
oz
can
pilsner
glass
very
light
clear
gold
big
fluffy
head
that
lasts
about
a
minute
and
becomes
clumpy
faint
adjunct
scent
almost
no
taste
watery
faint
hop
and
grain
crisp
feel
i
remember
this
being
better
strait
from
a
12
oz
bottle
but
still
not
the
worst
one
shot
im
not
sure
if
ive
changed
or
if
the
beer
has
but
there
just
isnt
much
of
anything
here
ill
stick
with
my
schlitz
pbr
ballantine
xxx
and
high
life
rotation
when
i
need
a
cheap
adjunct
from
now
on
ahhhh
six
pack
of
pounders
for
5
thanks
for
the
bargain
this
pours
yellow
and
clear
white
head
disappears
almost
immediately
smells
a
bit
grainy
but
aroma
really
is
unremarkable
spot
on
for
style
taste
is
grainy
with
grassy
and
metallic
notes
also
its
like
some
other
cornadjuncted
beers
but
the
flavors
are
muted
sooo
if
you
dont
like
the
aal
style
theres
less
here
to
dislike
as
with
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
clean
finish
is
somewhat
sweet
and
good
if
you
like
sweet
corn
light
mouthfeel
fits
the
style
overall
this
is
an
unoffensive
offering
that
is
cheap
readily
available
and
theres
a
horse
on
the
can
solid
3
out
of
5
thumbs
up
the
beer
is
very
simple
very
weak
clear
yet
it
still
is
skunky
enough
to
turn
me
off
from
having
too
many
one
is
enough
i
would
imagine
on
a
hot
day
this
sort
of
thing
would
really
hit
the
spot
but
such
hot
days
dont
happen
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
often
so
unfortunately
id
have
to
give
this
runofthemillbeerinagreenbottle
a
pass
overall
its
nothing
special
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
buzz
its
not
bad
and
id
certainly
accept
it
at
a
party
or
bbq
much
like
other
adjunct
lagers
its
good
on
a
hot
day
12oz
bottle
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
quickly
fading
white
head
aroma
of
grass
some
corn
some
faint
malt
in
the
taste
a
light
body
with
very
little
carbonation
and
a
watery
mouth
feel
finish
is
some
grass
with
some
light
malt
in
there
i
do
not
taste
any
hops
and
flavor
is
quite
bland
and
watery
i
would
not
drink
this
again
one
of
these
goes
down
so
easy
out
of
the
big
adjunct
lagers
this
one
is
probably
near
the
top
for
me
i
forget
the
price
point
for
this
but
id
let
this
replace
pbr
sometimes
not
noteworthy
at
all
for
the
style
except
to
keep
in
mind
not
to
bother
buying
any
more
of
this
and
please
beware
of
dogfish
head
raison
detreit
has
the
power
to
drive
you
mad
can
poured
a
super
pale
yellow
color
lager
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
light
retention
aroma
of
sweet
adjunct
is
gross
when
i
was
expecting
plain
bland
aroma
taste
is
also
gross
with
weird
adjunct
notes
that
are
not
even
refreshing
this
is
worse
then
i
was
expecting
i
e
plain
boring
coors
light
style
lager
ive
a
distinct
feeling
a
could
have
found
something
better
to
do
with
this
five
minutes
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
strong
throughout
the
palate
vegetal
harsh
aftertaste
that
is
counter
balanced
by
the
skunked
body
of
this
beer
yep
it
is
horrid
just
as
i
remembered
and
expected
next
bottom
line
if
youre
looking
for
something
to
drink
lots
of
go
for
it
i
usually
dont
get
it
but
when
the
grocery
store
has
it
on
sale
for
12
a
case
who
can
complain
im
almost
positive
this
bottle
green
was
skunkedfunky
aromafizzy
body
yet
with
a
head
that
disappeared
instantly
almost
as
pale
as
water
disappointing
overall
i
like
a
macrobrew
but
this
doesnt
cut
it
beers
like
this
seem
to
have
a
following
but
i
suspect
its
more
due
to
the
inexpensiveness
of
getting
tanked
as
opposed
to
flavor
i
cant
imagine
id
ever
settle
for
a
rolling
rock
again
filthy
flavorless
beer
and
a
waste
of
two
bucks
i
have
just
decided
i
prefer
the
rock
from
their
classic
painted
green
bottle
the
aromas
detract
from
what
i
would
consider
an
above
average
american
macro
when
consumed
from
the
bottle
i
admit
that
i
have
a
bias
towards
painted
labels
and
lighter
colored
glass
when
im
drinking
this
type
of
beer
dont
know
why
but
so
it
goes
will
i
buy
the
6
rolling
rock
12er
of
cans
again
ill
take
it
over
keystone
pbr
or
the
like
sorry
but
this
one
is
just
not
worth
the
effort
o
easy
drinking
but
down
get
your
hopes
up
id
chalk
it
up
as
another
average
macro
produced
light
lager
i
think
every
beer
drinker
should
have
a
favorite
cheap
beer
for
me
this
is
it
it
pours
a
very
fizzy
head
and
has
a
very
clear
appearance
smells
slightly
sweet
and
corny
tastes
much
the
same
no
bitter
aftertaste
goes
down
smooth
very
easy
to
chug
these
all
day
long
its
an
easily
drinkable
though
obviously
unsophisticated
beer
you
buy
this
because
its
cheap
but
you
buy
it
over
coors
because
it
isnt
gross
very
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
lots
of
lacing
for
a
pale
lager
foam
still
coating
the
empty
glass
long
afterwards
just
a
slight
bit
too
much
corn
taste
for
my
liking
but
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
for
the
price
light
years
better
than
the
macro
adjuncts
this
beer
always
goes
down
extremely
smooth
for
me
so
whenever
i
drink
one
i
end
up
drinking
8
or
9
ill
probably
be
revisiting
this
one
a
good
bit
in
the
near
future
o
not
a
horrible
big
guy
lager
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
offenda
decent
hot
weather
beer
plain
is
as
plain
does
this
doesnt
overtly
offend
nor
does
it
inspire
in
the
least
another
boring
abinbev
shell
company
lager
is
not
what
we
need
around
here
especially
at
joints
that
profess
to
damned
well
know
better
not
the
best
around
but
a
decent
choice
for
the
price
o
tastes
like
a
light
macro
that
someone
added
a
splash
of
syrupsweetener
to
despite
this
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
encountered
for
the
style
and
i
would
choose
this
over
the
big
three
any
day
it
definitely
poured
like
a
real
beer
and
looks
great
in
the
glass
very
drinkable
but
theres
little
in
the
way
of
flavor
i
used
to
love
this
beer
in
college
but
something
changed
in
my
opinion
when
ab
took
over
this
is
a
decent
summer
beer
in
that
its
easy
to
drink
and
when
its
cold
it
tasted
pretty
good
nothing
spectacular
or
above
average
about
it
and
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
i
wouldnt
say
i
wont
give
it
another
shot
nothing
that
special
thats
for
sure
i
liked
how
it
was
local
for
me
but
since
they
moved
out
of
the
state
the
beer
got
alittle
worse
the
water
source
used
to
make
the
beer
it
is
relatively
cheap
could
be
while
a
lot
of
people
are
attracted
to
it
but
the
taste
isnt
too
pure
to
me
o
not
my
style
and
not
worth
trying
again
o
meh
nothing
to
report
cheap
beer
goes
down
easy
but
nothing
special
at
all
final
grade
2
63
a
c
i
had
a
choice
between
this
and
coors
and
this
looked
classier
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
i
should
have
gone
for
the
coors
not
good
at
all
very
watery
and
as
i
recall
even
slightly
bitter
very
clear
light
and
fizzy
smells
terrible
and
the
aftertaste
isnt
much
better
i
have
to
say
i
was
actually
quite
surprised
this
may
be
the
best
beer
in
a
green
bottle
ive
had
probably
because
all
the
other
beers
ive
had
in
a
green
bottle
taste
like
rotten
lettuce
but
even
so
id
take
this
over
plenty
of
other
macros
simple
unoffensive
clean
notes
if
finished
while
cold
once
was
one
of
the
best
beers
brewed
in
pennsylvania
a
fantastic
extra
pale
ale
until
it
got
bought
out
by
anheuserbusch
now
it
tastes
different
certainly
not
good
but
it
pours
a
very
light
golden
yellow
with
a
bright
white
head
not
the
best
anymore
overall
this
is
not
a
horrible
beer
but
it
is
not
good
i
might
have
enjoyed
this
one
when
i
was
16
if
i
am
going
to
drink
cheap
piss
beer
i
am
going
to
drink
pbr
oly
hamms
or
rainier
in
my
mind
all
are
much
better
o
its
not
the
worst
macro
you
can
buy
but
i
wish
i
had
saved
the
15
and
gotten
a
keg
of
keystone
for
my
party
over
this
its
been
a
chore
to
finish
off
this
keg
before
getting
a
decent
one
back
in
the
ole
kegerator
it
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
little
head
definitely
has
a
sweet
corn
taste
one
of
the
best
light
beers
ive
ever
had
o
this
is
a
straight
up
aal
this
is
an
alright
beer
that
would
probably
taste
its
best
after
mowing
or
when
out
disc
golfing
when
no
craft
in
cans
are
at
my
disposal
rating
this
to
style
its
my
2nd
choice
of
aals
next
to
pbr
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
10
2011
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlels
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
light
gold
colour
with
a
this
bubbly
head
that
dissipated
into
nothing
within
a
minute
the
aroma
is
grain
metal
and
corn
the
mouthfeel
is
weak
bodied
almost
watery
with
mild
carbonation
the
flavour
is
weak
grainy
malt
with
an
acidic
aftertaste
a
good
working
from
home
beer
this
review
really
shouldnt
be
this
long
i
just
want
to
say
that
i
cant
believe
this
beer
even
gets
a
c
it
should
be
one
of
the
last
cheap
beers
you
buy
has
a
fairly
unique
taste
for
the
style
and
makes
a
good
ice
coldhot
day
thirst
quencher
id
grab
this
over
most
other
macro
alternatives
but
frankly
its
still
kind
of
gross
this
was
my
other
grandfathers
favorite
beer
he
would
probably
be
rolling
in
his
grave
knowing
that
it
was
sold
to
ab
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
yellow
color
with
a
head
that
quickly
vanishes
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
light
skunkiness
to
it
and
some
fresh
grains
and
corn
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
on
the
sweeter
side
and
has
a
decent
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
drinkable
overall
is
a
decent
social
drinking
brew
very
pale
colored
beer
lively
with
bubbles
and
with
a
fine
white
soapy
head
highly
adjunct
smell
mildly
grassy
hops
aromas
are
faint
and
removed
taster
is
very
mild
grainy
and
with
a
quick
finish
of
more
adjuncts
and
haylike
cheap
hops
meh
pretty
boring
beer
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
less
expensive
beers
this
is
the
perfect
thing
to
drink
after
a
long
day
at
your
bluecollar
job
thee
working
class
beer
for
sure
everything
from
the
cheap
taste
to
the
notso
frothy
head
to
the
awesome
greenglass
bottle
gets
me
excited
we
always
keep
some
rolling
rock
around
the
house
along
with
other
more
expensive
beers
but
i
always
keep
coming
back
to
the
rock
classy
maybe
not
sophisticated
no
delicious
for
what
it
is
without
a
doubt
wow
i
actually
used
to
drink
this
pours
a
clear
residual
brownishyellow
color
that
is
one
shade
away
from
being
water
thin
bubbly
white
head
naught
in
the
aroma
other
than
skunk
and
a
touch
of
grain
cereal
grains
in
the
tastebarelymetallic
and
skunky
light
and
watery
easy
to
drink
if
you
just
wanna
down
a
case
and
get
fitshaced
really
pale
almost
transparent
blonde
big
head
that
disapates
almost
instantly
smell
is
corn
and
grain
big
hints
of
cheese
lightly
malty
but
lots
of
cooked
corn
taste
is
all
corn
at
points
its
faintly
malty
and
lightly
bitter
but
cooked
corn
is
everywhere
in
this
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
watery
carb
is
really
high
this
was
awfull
i
didnt
get
past
a
quarter
pint
before
this
found
the
drain
this
is
really
bad
even
keeping
style
in
mind
even
within
this
anemic
style
this
is
not
a
winner
also
dont
drink
rolling
rock
out
of
a
can
i
know
its
tempting
but
dont
do
it
its
a
completely
different
experience
narrative
just
another
day
at
the
latrobe
waterpark
day
in
day
out
same
water
rushing
through
the
same
pipes
same
heat
same
dingy
finish
yet
each
summer
the
staff
felt
fulfilled
sure
it
was
a
cheap
gig
no
one
felt
exceptionally
proud
as
a
wild
aqua
waterpark
attendant
but
it
paid
for
just
enough
steel
reserve
in
the
evenings
to
make
the
oppressive
days
worthwhile
sure
you
get
the
occasional
obese
preteen
exhibiting
his
rebellious
nature
coming
down
backwards
it
was
a
mild
hell
with
mild
rewards
but
long
term
sustainability
sure
you
get
100
patrons
in
a
day
urinating
in
the
fetid
pools
adolescents
having
tawdry
affairs
in
the
bushes
and
a
thousand
forgettable
days
however
some
days
the
employees
would
look
left
to
right
and
realize
how
good
they
had
it
stop
no
running
also
stop
uriniating
while
running
thank
you
for
not
running
now
stop
urinating
just
another
solid
sunday
in
july
watery
beer
thats
good
for
chugging
down
hard
to
pick
up
quality
tastes
to
it
for
that
reason
tastes
like
bud
light
or
other
american
macro
beers
o
other
than
being
slightly
better
than
coors
light
and
bud
light
this
beer
has
nothing
really
going
for
it
its
great
if
you
want
something
thats
easy
to
drink
15
of
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
light
bodied
beer
nothing
special
but
i
would
choose
it
over
bud
and
miller
and
the
likes
since
i
am
from
pa
this
beer
along
with
yuengling
has
a
substantial
following
it
is
just
a
shame
its
not
made
in
latrobe
anymore
and
it
has
become
consumed
by
the
inbev
anheuserbusch
giant
a
serviceable
and
unoffensive
adjunct
lager
good
for
the
style
but
the
style
doesnt
demand
a
lot
ill
take
this
over
a
bud
or
a
blue
d
it
is
what
it
is
i
suppose
typical
light
beer
without
noticeable
flaws
for
the
style
easy
drinking
o
pretty
similar
to
most
macro
lagers
drinking
it
cold
is
better
than
warm
when
it
starts
to
go
downhill
fast
pours
a
small
one
finger
white
head
that
will
probably
be
gone
soon
the
body
is
completely
see
through
and
here
is
loads
of
carbonation
coming
up
through
the
yellow
body
looks
like
i
might
get
decent
lacing
but
overall
nothing
special
on
the
look
here
looks
like
a
normal
adjunct
lager
with
possibly
some
ok
lacing
smell
is
sour
adjunct
malt
but
there
is
also
sweet
malt
smell
in
there
somewhere
which
is
good
considering
this
is
made
by
bud
no
real
hops
to
speak
of
on
the
smell
that
sweet
malt
smell
is
the
only
real
good
thing
and
thats
a
real
stretch
because
almost
all
adjunct
lagers
have
the
sweet
smell
its
only
the
real
bad
ones
that
only
have
the
sour
smell
the
taste
is
pretty
disappointing
though
no
real
sweet
malt
on
the
taste
only
sour
adjunct
flavor
on
the
taste
and
the
rest
of
the
taste
is
just
water
there
is
no
skunky
flavor
or
smell
and
that
is
good
because
its
in
a
green
bottle
the
taste
overall
though
just
isnt
good
its
honestly
tastes
like
soap
a
little
bit
it
finishes
really
dry
and
like
i
said
it
tastes
a
lot
like
soap
this
beer
is
disappointing
because
i
recall
like
rolling
rock
at
least
a
little
more
than
this
ill
give
it
a
1
5
instead
of
a
1
because
im
a
long
time
fan
and
because
it
did
end
up
giving
me
pretty
solid
lacing
even
though
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
flavor
i
mean
the
tastes
isnt
awful
it
isnt
much
worse
than
most
adjunct
lagers
but
that
soapy
taste
really
bothers
me
its
really
subtle
but
still
the
mouthfeel
is
bad
but
thats
to
be
expected
with
an
adjunct
lager
the
drinkability
is
ok
but
that
soapy
taste
for
sure
brings
it
down
overall
on
this
beer
i
dunno
in
terms
of
adjunct
lagers
its
ok
not
a
bad
appearance
and
not
the
worse
smell
but
the
soapy
flavor
really
dings
this
beer
for
me
i
hate
to
say
it
too
because
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
rolling
rock
drinkability
certainly
and
incredibly
drinkable
beer
it
lacks
in
complexity
as
pretty
much
all
of
this
style
tend
to
but
its
better
then
alot
of
the
others
in
this
field
its
made
for
sessioning
on
a
real
hot
summer
night
or
day
when
your
not
trying
to
think
much
or
spend
much
its
a
relative
value
considering
about
3
dollars
less
for
30
then
say
millercoorsbud
and
if
not
better
certainly
the
equal
not
sure
how
it
compares
to
the
days
of
old
but
certainly
and
inoffensive
beer
that
fits
well
for
what
it
is
this
is
listed
as
an
adjunct
lager
and
tastes
like
one
but
i
always
thought
it
was
a
pale
ale
anyways
its
pretty
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
its
a
beer
that
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
just
to
kill
my
thirst
more
corn
grits
and
biscuity
pale
malt
in
the
flavor
not
much
bitterness
or
hop
character
here
but
does
seem
to
have
a
bit
more
flavor
than
most
of
the
massproduced
adjunct
lagers
out
there
id
say
this
is
an
above
average
aal
but
not
worth
the
premium
prices
they
charge
for
it
rolling
rock
extra
pale
seems
to
get
a
lot
of
negative
reviews
but
i
have
to
wonder
what
people
were
expecting
when
they
bought
it
for
7
a
six
pack
its
on
the
lower
end
of
the
price
spectrum
i
would
put
it
a
peg
higher
than
the
traditional
domestic
macros
but
not
much
else
i
think
you
get
what
you
pay
for
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
if
ive
got
a
little
extra
cash
and
feel
like
getting
thoroughly
sloshed
i
would
probably
choose
this
over
budweiser
or
pbr
bottle
left
in
fridge
from
neighbor
pours
pale
golden
color
with
thin
head
nose
is
a
bit
offputting
with
some
cooked
veggies
and
a
weird
metalliclike
aroma
palate
has
a
light
character
overall
making
me
wonder
if
a
lot
of
rice
was
used
because
i
dont
get
a
decent
malt
component
like
some
other
adjunct
lagers
the
veggies
from
the
nose
are
on
the
palate
too
watery
used
to
be
a
decent
beer
when
it
was
not
owned
by
anheiser
bush
then
corporate
america
came
in
and
closed
the
plant
but
continue
to
falsely
advertise
and
market
the
beer
as
a
latrobe
beer
the
only
thing
still
tying
this
beer
back
to
latrobe
is
the
fact
that
it
taste
like
arnold
palmers
piss
now
there
is
no
difference
between
this
beer
and
a
bud
now
a
days
this
is
a
standard
american
macro
lager
similar
taste
to
bud
light
light
corn
taste
lots
of
carbonation
light
in
the
mouth
all
in
all
this
beer
blows
but
hey
im
no
advocate
of
macro
brew
beer
so
im
a
bit
prejudice
drunkabiliity
isnt
bad
tho
rolling

binge
drink
beer
o
i
used
to
like
this
stuff
when
i
was
in
high
school
but
the
more
i
drink
it
the
less
i
care
for
it
d
a
highlight
of
this
beer
several
can
be
had
in
a
single
sitting
there
is
something
nice
and
refreshing
about
a
rolling
rock
especially
in
a
can
that
green
color
gets
you
every
time
and
make
sure
its
ice
cold
this
pale
clear
yellow
straw
colored
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
is
overly
carbonated
its
fizzy
watery
and
has
no
body
the
smell
is
faint
sweet
corn
some
malt
a
touch
of
citrus
and
a
pound
of
skunk
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
some
metallic
notes
thrown
in
its
gross
musty
skunky
and
watery
super
light
and
bitter
note
it
is
subfreezing
when
i
write
this
if
i
were
reviewing
in
midaugust
rr
might
get
a
review
one
full
grade
higher
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
super
light
session
beer
thats
not
too
boring
then
this
might
be
a
better
compromise
than
some
of
the
other
similar
aals
out
there
drinkability
yes
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
dry
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
drinks
fairly
quick
but
more
due
to
lack
of
flavor
than
anything
else
definitely
another
crappy
adjunct
but
better
than
some
other
similar
beers
one
of
my
old
college
roommates
used
to
take
this
wherever
we
went
so
im
kind
of
partial
to
it
i
dont
exactly
put
it
in
the
macro
category
it
pours
a
very
pale
and
thin
straw
yellow
with
a
one
finger
bright
white
head
with
decent
lacing
it
smells
of
grass
yeast
hay
and
soda
water
for
the
style
i
like
the
flavor
it
features
possible
hops
and
grass
and
goes
down
very
light
its
a
little
watery
but
i
find
this
to
be
the
most
drinkable
aal
around
as
for
feel
and
drinkability
the
feel
is
crisp
but
smooth
light
but
not
watery
it
is
especially
refreshing
and
goes
down
with
the
best
of
them
recommend
it
with
pizza
or
burgers
a
good
bargrill
or
party
beer
congratulations
rolling
rock
you
have
survived
this
round
of
economy
class
beer
competition
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
over
most
pale
lagers
drinkability
its
about
average
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
i
was
at
a
gathering
and
there
was
nothing
left
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
go
after
this
on
a
regular
watery
enough
to
drink
a
lot
of
and
just
enough
lack
of
flavor
to
not
phase
you
in
a
negative
way
nearly
clear
pale
golden
with
minimal
white
head
that
fades
fast
and
very
apparent
carbonation
nearly
no
aroma
hint
of
malt
very
watery
flavor
and
palate
very
light
smooth
and
pretty
refreshing
not
very
pale
though
or
even
slightly
no
hops
nice
cheap

d
one
of
the
easiest
beers
to
drink
in
my
opinion
not
great
but
not

is
okay
i
guess
if
i
wanted
to
get
messed
up
and
this
was
all
they
had
id
take
it
d
i
could
certainly
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
gathering
but
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
those
looking
for
a
fuller
experience
m
d
dry
must
be
cold
the
sweet
floral
thing
is
a
bit
interesting
and
it
lingers
for
a
while
there
is
actually
a
bit
of
hops
there
moreso
than
other
macros
points
off
due
to
this
beer
being
postioned
as
a
premium
beer
dragging
through
the
bland
taste
to
create
a
beer
experience
that
is
not

when
the

are

you
are

look

i

when

this
one
is
hard
to
beat
if
you
dont
want
to
drink
down
the
fancy
beers
in
the
cellar
or
fridge
really
nice
head
and
it
holds
on
for
a
long
time
especially
for
the
style
the
lager
yeast
is
different
too
less
bready
more
compatible
with
the
light
hops
in
here
and
working
sugars
down
to
a
very
very
dry
finishing
beverage
tasty
really
no
complaints
for
this

group

make

a

richer
with
a

a
little

note
to
balance
the
taste
one
of

quenchers
easy

down

there

i
used
to
drink
this
beer
in
jr
high
i
hadnt
had
it
since
then
early
70s
so
when
i
had
it
recently
i
was
a
little
nervous
i
was
not
just
relieved
but
overjoyed
that
it
tasted
exactly
as
i
thought
i
had
remembered
it
even
though
it
was
the
first
time
i
think
i
had
had
it
actually
cold
a
flood
of
memories
came
to
me
of
hanging
out
with
my
friends
skipping
school
on
a
beautiful
spring
day
drinking
beers
by
the
lake
o
nothing
special
at
all
i
really
do
not
like
pbr
so
saying
it
is
a
better
version
is
not
high
praise
at
all
despite
what
nicolas
cage
says
pretty
neutral
beer
that
would
be
pretty
good
for
a
long
drinking
session
has
drinkability
but
tastes
pretty
typical
o
this
beer
surprised
me
a
bit
and
i
might
just
reach
for
another
on
a
sweltering
summer
day
definitely
a
cut
above
many
of
the
pale
watery
offerings
to
be
found
within

genre

color

soapy
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
grainy
corn
grass
and
light
malt
aromas
with
floral
hop
notes
carbonation
was
slightly
subdued
up
front
creating
a
creamy
feel
light
tangy
hop
crispness
through
the
middle
up
front
with
a
clean
semidry
finish
flavors
are
in
line
with
the
aromas
light
crisp
and
refreshing
by
far
the
best
lager
of
its
kind
that
ive
had
to
date
love
the
tall
boy
too
when
you
factor
in
the
price
you
cant
beat
it
overall
this
is
a
severely
underrated
style
due
to
its
simplicity
but
narragansett
lager
is
an
exemplary
addition
to
the
style
this
is
probably
my
favorite
aal
to
date
and
one
that
will
be
hard
to
beat
at
5
49sixer
of
16oz
cans
this
beer
is
impossible
to
beat
in
terms
of
flavor
and
value
this
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
during
the
hot
summer
months
where
a
simple
easy
drinking
beer
is
all
one
really
wants
until
the
sun
sets
and
the
heat
subsides
a
bit
would
highly
recommend
as
a
goto
everyday
cheap
beer
o
the
best
of
the
style
so
far
o
as
far
as
aals
go
this
is
up
for
the
best
more
flavorful
malt
forward
makes
it
stand
out
of
a
group
of
bland
watery
beers
a
standard
beer
by
definition
although
a
lot
of
their
seasonal
and
limited
beers
are
great
it
is
still
a
staple
in
my
house
this
is
comparable
to
most
of
the
big
guys
bud
coors
pbr
but
i
found
it
to
be
better
in
that
is
not
as
filling
nor
do
i
feel
as
bad
for
buying
a
six
pack
the
appearance
is
a
very
light
yellow
with
a
strong
smell
of
wheat
the
taste
is
okay
and
it
has
a
light
feel
to
it
without
sacrificing
too
much
flavor
so
if
you
want
to
get
something
to
appease
friends
who
are
used
to
drinking
bud
but
dont
want
to
give
anheuserbusch
your
money
this
is
a
great
way
to
go
not
my
normal
style
of
beer
but
is
a
good
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
also
a
safe
bet
to
buy
for
events
like
parties
and
whatnot
pours
with
bright
clarity
golden
amber
with
a
soapy
head
that
fell
fast
nose
is
corn
grits
corn
sweetness
and
some
fresh
cut
hay
lightly
sweet
and
no
apple
on
the
nose
at
all
taste
is
light
lightly
sweet
and
has
a
bit
of
thin
apple
thin
malt
with
a
bit
of
light
watery
body
touch
of
sulfur
on
the
nose
at
first
but
that
dissipates
smooth
but
has
a
nice
bite
on
the
tongue
from
carbonation
refreshing
with
no
real
hop
bitter
maybe
a
hint
of
it
and
some
lemon
in
the
dry
finish
this
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
fizzy
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
and
grainy
the
taste
is
fairly
simple
and
light
this
is
fairly
decent
tasting
for
being
a
lighter
beer
i
would
definitely
take
this
over
a
millerbudcoors
any
day
overall
a
very
well
done
adjunct
lager
hops
and
mouthfeel
make
it
stand
on
its
own
overall
for
the
price
it
cant
be
beat
and
its
cartoon
ads
from
back
in
the
day
are
still
the
best
this
is
my
favorite
beer
i
know
its
not
fancy
but
it
goes
with
any
food
occasion
and
drinks
well
i
love
the
history
of
the
brand
and
really
hope
that
they
can
bring
the
brewery
back
to
rhode
island
the
beer
isnt
heavy
or
loaded
with
hops
its
well
balanced
when
i
think
of
beer
this
is
the
beer
i
think
of
overall
gansett
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
classic
basic
american
beer
its
not
a
beer
that
makes
you
agonize
over
the
hop
profile
and
things
like
that
its
a
beer
to
pair
with
pizza
and
football
on
tv
like
im
doing
right
now
or
to
have
outside
on
a
hot
day
its
also
a
good
lager
to
cook
with
weve
used
it
to
make
vegetable
stews
and
beer
cheese
grits
and
it
always
holds
up
its
end
of
the
bargain
if
you
like
u
s
a
lager
youd
be
crazy
not
to
try
this
because
its
also
cheap
usually
around
6
for
six
tallboys
o
a
good
lager
a
little
above
the
mainstream
had
more
malt
flavor
the
first
time
i
had
one
this
one
was
strangely
fruity
at
first
although
that
faded
certainly
a
refreshing
warm
weather
beer
or
any
time
a
thirst
quencher
is
sought
o
i
can
score
a
6pack
of
16
ounce
cans
for
6
i
think
thats
a
pretty
good
deal
for
a
refreshing
beer
that
isnt
bmc
one
of
the
best
adjunct
lagers
on
the
market
not
offensive
in
the
slightest
actually
has
a
taste
that
brings
you
back
for
more
anyway
its
a
decent
beer
something
to
enjoy
after
vigorous
exercise
i
cant
finish
this
case
tried
it
4
or
5
different
times
and
its
a
drain
pour
perhaps
too
many
temperature
changes
before
i
bought
it
very
bad
overall
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
a
better
than
average
aal
has
more
flavor
than
most
and
is
easydrinking
i
would
pick
this
up
on
occassion
if
it
were
available
to
me
this
is
a
nostalgia
beer
for
me
lot
of
it
down
the
pipe
while
stationed
at
westover
afb
back
in
the
day
whenever
i
travel
to
mass
on
business
i
grab
a
gansett
since
it
came
back
in
2005
interesting
that
it
was
out
of
business
during
my
drinking
hiatus
still
my
favorite
upeast
lager
brewed
in
upstate
ny
good
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
nice
lace
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
the
beer
is
good
with
any
food
my
preference
is
some
good
new
england
chowder
a
burger
and
a
gansett
poured
this
from
a
can
to
a
pint
glass
at
scratch
kitchen
in
salem
ma
the
label
says
hi
neighbor
have
a
gansett
id
have
to
say
have
something
else
overall
a
simple
refreshing
relatively
clean
aal
could
easily
knock
a
few
of
these
back
on
a
warm
evening
o
definitely
outstanding
for
the
style
as
it
is
an
enjoyable
aal
which
only
makes
it
an
about
average
beer
nevertheless
i
wish
i
could
get
it
more
easily
in
my
area
because
it
deserves
periodic
rotation
in
my
fridge
o
tasty
aal
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
just
a
good
beer
beer
all
around
o
solid
lager
a
beer
geek
would
expect
the
worse
but
this
isnt
horribly
bad
honestly
id
drink
this
again
on
a
hot
afternoon
on
cape
cod
o
overall
there
isnt
a
ton
going
on
here
and
it
is
pretty
average
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
for
an
aal
lots
of
grains
and
bready
malts
and
easy
to
drink
id
prefer
this
over
most
bmc
products
yep
this
is
actually
quite
a
competent
beer
for
the
style
not
much
on
the
hops
but
still
not
offensive
with
the
hop
or
malt
profile
overall
3
75
pretty
much
fits
the
aal
profile
to
a
t
but
it
does
so
in
a
much
more
satisfying
way
than
the
standard
watereddown
fizzy
yellow
macro
it
doesnt
blow
anyone
away
but
it
does
what
its
supposed
to
do
well
and
in
a
much
more
satisfying
way
than
any
macro
aal
as
far
as
the
traditional
review
categories
id
just
say
that
gansett
is
really
just
on
par
with
the
course
its
tough
for
me
to
differentiate
it
from
other
aals
and
yet
i
still
opt
for
it
from
time
to
time
because
im
a
sucker
for
good
marketing
and
if
theyve
got
one
thing
going
for
them
down
in
providence
its
marketing
ogreat
for
hot
sunny
days
beaches
boat
rides
or
games
of
mario
kart
in
a
college
dorm
now
this
is
an
aal
that
i
can
back
my
support
for
totally
refreshing
and
flavorful
and
a
really
nice
thing
to
have
after
a
long
day
or
er
a
long
week
of
drinking
huge
beers
i
would
recommend
pairing
this
with
food
think
bbq
steak
tomato
soup
rather
than
on
its
own
but
it
works
well
with
the
warming
weather
over
here
glad
i
could
try
it
and
wish
we
got
it
out
here
in
the
west
bready
malts
up
front
with
honey
sweetness
hints
of
corn
cereal
and
toasted
grains
light
cideryfruitiness
mixes
with
spicy
peppery
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
lingering
honey
cereal
sweetness
moderate
body
with
a
lively
refreshing
feel
a
pretty
decent
aal
that
leans
on
the
sweet
side
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slightly
metallic
grassy
hop
note
and
a
bit
of
apple
cider
flavor
is
pretty
much
right
there
also
sweet
and
malty
up
front
sweeter
than
i
would
normally
like
but
does
taste
malty
rather
than
just
sugary
like
most
others
in
the
category
the
metallic
hoppiness
comes
out
about
midway
and
reigns
in
the
sweetness
a
bit
before
the
finish
carbonation
is
moderate
and
doesnt
bite
too
hard
a
crystal
clear
gold
on
the
pour
with
a
large
twofinger
white
head
scents
of
sweet
lemon
bars
dry
grains
slight
hints
of
fresh
hops
not
bad
crisp
refreshing
mouth
perfect
for
the
style
mild
light
citrus
notes
mild
hops
dry
husk
sweet
kiss
on
the
finish
this
is
always
an
easydrinking
ale
for
the
warm
months
its
got
a
bit
more
girth
and
flavor
than
most
other
adjuncts
so
ill
reach
for
this
again
nice
beer
o
not
actually
bad
but
trivially
different
from
other
macrobrewery
american
adjunct
lagers
notes
i
like
everything
about
this
beer
brewed
in
my
hometown
of
rochester
a
retro
brand
that
was
a
long
term
advertising
sponsor
of
my
boston
red
sox
the
attractive
old
school
can
and
is
easy
to
drink
and
good
looking
all
this
for
ninety
cents
a
pint
drinking
this
evokes
memories
of
what
i
think
retro
lagers
of
old
tasted
like
while
listening
to
a
baseball
game
on
the
radio
i
think
i
just
found
a
new
lawnmower
beer
one
of
the
better
american
adjunct
lagers
on
the
market
nice
and
clean
and
even
when
warm
it
doesnt
bottom
out
and
suck
drinkable
at
all
temperatures
and
thats
worth
a
little
something
especially
for
the
style
o
a
decent
easy
drinking
lager
ive
heard
about
this
since
i
started
reading
about
beer
especially
since
trying
to
find
which
economy
beer
is
most
worth
buying
this
beer
was
decent
and
worth
the
low
price
tag
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
at
all
ive
had
cheaper
beer
that
was
better
this
one
tastes
a
lot
like
the
cheapest
beer
in
america
big
flats
it
bears
some
similarities
to
asian
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
as
well
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
not
as
good
as
old
milwaukee
which
is
cheaper
and
a
tiny
bit
less
bland
overall
this
is
the
best
american
adjust
lager
i
have
had
isnt
offensive
and
actually
quite
easy
drinking
drinks
pretty
well
especially
for
its
style
not
bad
at
all
for
the
style
tastes
less
cheap
and
sweeter
than
many
others
thanks
to
merc7186
for
this
one
first
and
foremost
i
grew
up
in
narragansett
ri
the
town
for
which
the
beer
is
named
and
originally
from
with
that
said
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
beer
thin
and
gold
appearance
and
easy
to
drink
it
is
good
choice
among
pabst
blue
ribbon
and
other
inexpensive
beers
if
your
at
a
bar
and
have
2
bucks
in
your
pocket
you
wont
be
dissipated
by
this
great
brew
notes
this
one
is
not
to
shaby
a
good
dry
finish
and
quite
drinkable
cheers
i
rate
this
a
5
overall
because
i
am
rating
it
by
its
style
its
not
trying
to
be
an
ipa
or
euro
lager
white
head
but
not
much
too
it
slightly
malty
smell
clean
finish
very
refreshinging
lager
but
cleaner
than
most
adjuncts
happy
to
drink
it
again
can
is
better
than
bottle
for
carbonation
and
appearance
of
head
this
may
have
been
a
bad
bottle
cap
as
it
was
slightly
flat
tast
was
fine
but
carbonation
was
very
low
not
much
head
at
all
honestly
you
cant
beat
the
price
5
99
for
a
sixer
of
tall
boys
this
is
a
pretty
straightforward
example
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
o
my
friends
in
florida
think
im
goofy
for
taking
a
northeastern
lager
as
my
go
to
beer
it
truly
is
one
of
the
best
aals
around
and
at
6
for
6
pints
its
a
good
deal
theres
always
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
in
my
fridge
overall
though
still
quite
solid
for
a
mass
lager
style
i
could
have
this
again
easily
and
its
a
great
alternative
to
others
similar
in
the
style
overall
for
1
05
for
a
tall
boy
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
it
would
be
a
great
session
brew
so
if
going
for
a
long
steady
night
it
may
be
a
good
choice
o
pretty
standard
lager
i
would
drink
it
again
and
the
price
is
more
than
right
at
66pack
originally
reviewed
10182011
o
id
say
this
is
pretty
good
probably
come
back
to
it
eventually
in
the
summer
months
perhaps
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
midgrade
beer
it
doesnt
quite
have
enough
complexity
or
nuance
to
compete
with
say
a
dogfish
head
but
then
its
not
intended
to
instead
it
provides
a
clean
wellbalanced
refreshing
flavorful
profile
that
leaves
the
tongue
wanting
more
and
with
a
5
abv
is
nicely
suited
for
lunch
perfect
camping
or
beach
fare
not
really
an
impressive
beer
but
easy
to
quaff
during
the
summer
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
this
is
just
regular
genny
with
a
different
label
tastes
very
similar
poured
an
impressive
4
white
head
which
really
had
a
pretty
decent
lifespan
for
a
bmcstyled
lager
the
body
is
clear
straw
yellow
and
it
exhausted
all
the
carbonation
into
the
head
it
smells
of
grass
and
malt
but
more
on
the
malt
side
than
most
bmcs
taste
matched
the
smell
its
a
little
watery
but
thats
true
to
the
bmc
style
theres
a
nice
little
acidic
zing
at
the
end
kind
of
like
a
bud
ill
tell
you
what
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
of
the
bmc
persuasion
this
holds
its
own
against
the
big
boys
o
finally
well
not
technically
an
aal
with
flavor
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
cheap
and
of
course
readily
available
go
get
some
now
this
i
could
drink
all
summer
very
smooth
with
only
a
hint
of
sweetness
very
balanced
no
hop
bitterness
no
frills
at
all
it
doesnt
try
to
blow
you
away
yet
still
packs
some
flavor
very
well
done
this
american
adjunct
standard
lager
sets
the
standard
for
the
style
a
great
beer
for
a
notoriously
lousy
genre
narragansett
lager
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
want
to
drown
in
after
a
good
ole
fashioned
lawnmowing
session
while
you
kick
back
and
wait
for
the
coals
to
heat
up
very
nicely
priced
at
around
a
buck
a
tallboy
this
is
a
beer
you
should
always
have
on
hand
especially
if
youre
a
new
englander
o
good
for
what
it
is
drink
it
ice
cold
and
fast
and
its
a
decent
refreshing
beer
overall
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
certain
one
of
the
better
bargain
beers
out
there
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
a
lot
maltier
compared
to
other
adjunct
lagers
with
less
noticeable
presence
of
adjuncts
it
definitely
tastes
a
lot
better
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
overall
solid
offering
for
a
16
oz
can
and
affordable
budget
good
and
better
than
more
mass
produced
breweries
happy
to
enjoy
these
in
16
oz
cans
ganset
is
a
good
budget
beer
the
appearance
is
golden
with
little
head
that
quickly
fizzes
away
smell
is
yeasty
with
some
corngrain
scent
taste
is
similar
sweet
malt
with
mild
hop
on
the
backit
does
have
a
distinct
bite
mouthfeel
is
crisp
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
only
see
in
in
tallboy
cans
in
my
area
i
wish
the
other
ganset
beers
made
it
this
far
north
would
like
to
try
them
d
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
more
off
of
the
tap
the
appeal
of
this
went
away
after
6
oz
or
so
but
i
finished
the
liquid
with
ease
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
american
adjunct
lager
actually
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
recently
i
think
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
not
overpowering
this
beer
is
definitely
better
than
expected
better
balance
than
i
expected
drink
too
light
and
just
doesnt
work
together
un
balanced
and
lacks
a
certain
punch
i
know
its
a
aal
but
just
needs
more
from
a
craft
brewer
drinkability
generally
not
my
style
but
i
can
appreciate
nonetheless
this
is
a
well
executed
example
and
a
solid
and
refreshing
beer
this
is
an
alright
beer
for
the
style
its
balanced
unoffensive
and
refreshing
if
i
were
looking
for
a
tailgate
beer
this
would
be
a
good
choice
o
for
lager
in
a
can
one
of
the
better
choices
extra
points
for
local
in
a
can
not
my
favorite
style
but
better
than
the
macros
overall
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
and
could
easily
pass
as
a
regular
lager
probably
my
favorite
adjunct
golden
beer
with
a
big
foamy
head
strong
aroma
of
bread
with
some
hints
of
berries
and
grass
crisp
fruity
flavor
with
bread
and
grain
the
breadiness
fades
as
the
beer
gets
a
little
warmer
ive
already
reviewed
this
beer
from
a
can
and
this
is
radically
different
its
still
a
decent
adjunct
lager
but
buy
it
in
a
can
if
possible
i
would
recommend
this
lager
as
a
quality
brew
at
a
very
affordable
price
pours
a
clear
dark
yellow
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
of
corn
and
bread
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
mainly
doughy
with
some
hay
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
decent
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
in
the
beginning
but
it
gives
way
to
a
bmc
flavor
and
watery
thin
mouthfeel
as
it
warms
narragansett
lager
is
acceptable
barely
recommended
that
being
said
i
drink
these
its
not
bad
and
its
cheap
and
sessionable
i
would
buy
gansett
more
often
for
session
drinking
if
boston
lager
brooklyn
lager
and
prima
pils
werent
so
readily
available
and
reasonably
priced
in
12
packs
taste
it
for
yourself
you
can
buy
a
lot
more
expensive
beer
but
still
not
compare
to
what
narragansett
is
brewing
i
have
not
been
let
down
by
anything
that
has
their
name
on
it
the
lager
is
good
to
go
to
anytime
but
their
seasonal
releases
are
their
finest
works
even
their
prices
seem
fairly
low
for
a
product
this
good
great
job
narragansett
o
a
nice
american
lager
o
umm
its
a
lager
baby
definitly
better
than
bmc
one
of
the
best
adjunct
lagers
i
have
had
not
sure
if
that
is
saying
much
really
drinkable
goes
down
easy
not
really
my
style
but
it
is
very
good
for
what
it
is
o
not
a
bad
lager
this
would
be
an
awesome
tailgating
beer
as
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
and
so
could
most
everybody
i
know
pretty
tasty
stuff
a
solid
entry
in
the
lawnmower
beer
category
lively
carbonation
clean
moderately
crisp
malt
with
subdued
grain
notes
a
touch
of
grassyness
and
a
hint
of
nehi
grape
i
may
be
the
only
one
who
gets
this
from
some
lagers
i
find
it
prounounced
in
moelson
canadian
a
nice
classic
macro
feel
to
this
beer
not
particularly
flavorful
but
clean
and
easy
to
drink
well
this
lager
must
have
just
arrived
in
the
south
i
had
never
heard
about
it
until
a
few
weeks
go
this
is
a
classic
clean
easy
drinking
american
lager
that
has
flavor
to
it
pbr
schlitz
high
life
and
now
narragansett
these
are
the
american
macros
i
never
mind
picking
up
if
i
am
on
a
budget
overall
a
very
good
aal
but
an
aal
just
the
same
taste
is
pleasant
and
slightly
sweeter
than
the
nose
might
suggest
yet
still
subdued
as
one
would
expect
for
the
style
malty
enough
to
give
a
certain
slickness
to
the
feel
particularly
given
the
lack
of
coarseness
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
as
a
result
lending
a
bit
more
style
and
depth
than
you
might
get
from
the
big
boys
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
moderate
lemony
cracker
finish
not
sure
it
can
dethrone
pbr
as
a
preferred
macro
but
then
it
offers
a
very
different
and
welcome
approach
a
solid
american
lager
with
some
good
malt
flavor
nice
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
beer
america
is
known
for
and
thats
not
always
a
bad
thing
value
dont
even
go
there
i
can
get
a
sixer
of
tall
boys
of
this
stuff
in
florida
for
six
bucks
its
a
steal
notes
if
im
going
to
do
an
aal
this
is
usually
my
pick
great
value
at
7
for
a
six
pack
of
tall
boy
cans
a
great
choice
for
tailgaiting
and
other
such
activities
bad
beer
not
sure
where
the
hype
came
from
almost
guaranteed
from
the
name
pretty
typical
stuff
pale
malts
and
a
breeze
of
grassy
bitter
hops
not
a
bad
cheap
bbq
beer
but
not
something
thatll
really
wow
you
color
is
honey
gold
with
plenty
of
big
white
head
that
doesnt
last
worth
a
lick
nose
is
not
completely
unpleasant
but
does
show
adjunct
tendencies
and
some
basic
graininess
the
flavor
is
light
and
creamy
compared
to
most
from
the
style
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
once
you
get
used
to
the
surprising
creaminess
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
unique
local
lager
that
has
become
an
endangered
species
with
the
rise
of
bmc
for
what
category
this
beer
falls
into
for
most
people
it
really
isnt
bad
i
would
much
prefer
this
to
the
bud
coors
or
miller
product
lines
no
offensive
flavors
just
a
light
lager
profile
rjt
o
nice
beer
better
than
the
bmc
offerings
cant
beat
the
price
either
now
to
figure
out
my
hurricane
plan
i
dont
know
if
staying
at
the
bar
late
is
a
good
one
not
impressed
even
for
an
adjunct
good
served
very
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
generally
pretty
ordinary
but
ill
buy
it
every
now
and
then
for
the
nostalgia
official
beer
of
the
clam
pours
a
clear
pale
clear
color
hints
of
yellow
fluffy
head
does
not
last
scent
is
of
sweet
corn
but
understated
is
not
offensive
taste
is
grainy
slightly
sweet
does
not
get
in
its
own
way
of
being
a
drinkable
adjunct
lager
dors
have
a
bit
more
taste
than
others
ive
had
in
this
style
mouthfeel
is
neutral
and
leaves
this
a
highly
drinkable
lager
only
problem
for
me
no
clams
the
beer
has
a
substantial
corny
flavor
so
i
fear
if
this
warms
too
much
it
will
get
nasty
nothing
really
stands
out
middle
of
the
pack
for
a
lackluster
style
my
goto
beer
if
im
not
in
the
mood
for
a
craft
brew
flavor
bomb
great
value
too
d
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
sip
after
sip
surprisingly
quaffable
a
solid
adjunct
lager
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
a
respectable
alternative
when
better
craft
alternatives
are
not
available
overall
this
is
a
typical
adjunct
lager
it
is
better
than
some
but
not
as
good
as
pbr
high
life
or
schlitz
gusto
or
even
bud
in
my
opinion
o
not
terrible
but
not
great
hard
for
an
american
adjunct
to
really
wow
me
would
rather
drink
this
than
most
others
in
the
style
though
overall
keeping
style
in
mind
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
a
macro
that
actually
has
some
taste
and
character
in
comparison
to
its
generic
bmc
counterparts
the
cpj
clear
gold
with
a
soapy
white
head
not
much
retention
or
lacing
dry
malty
aroma
sweet
with
mild
grassyspicy
hops
tastes
pretty
good
low
bitterness
with
balanced
sweetness
grassy
and
spicy
hops
a
bit
floral
light
bodied
but
not
overly
dry
mediumlow
carbonation
decent
texture
overall
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
i
was
happy
i
grabbed
a
sixpack
rather
than
a
single
overall
crisp
and
clean
lager
with
full
flavor
great
beer
now
i
just
wish
they
distributed
here
in
nola
since
the
dawn
of
my
interest
in
beer
i
have
always
retained
an
odd
fascination
with
finding
the
best
of
the
cheap
narragansett
was
actually
one
of
the
beers
i
bought
on
my
21st
birthday
i
didnt
really
like
it
then
but
as
the
years
have
passed
i
have
tried
other
cheap
beers
and
i
eventually
decided
to
try
this
again
now
i
believe
that
this
just
might
be
the
best
5
six
pack
out
there
o
i
suppose
its
a
little
better
than
coors
light
but
its
not
like
i
would
make
a
big
deal
about
this
beer
this
is
a
gassy
beer
burp
that
can
easily
be
thrown
back
to
quench
a
summer
thirst
and
that
is
exactly
i
had
i
think
of
this
beer
bright
golden
hey
colored
with
a
huge
white
fizzy
head
on
top
that
quickly
faded
leaving
behind
nearly
nothing
in
its
wake
aroma
of
grain
light
notes
of
corn
and
bready
malts
then
proceeded
to
take
over
not
terrible
really
did
not
have
that
musky
and
cardboard
like
aroma
i
have
come
to
see
from
a
few
crisp
and
clean
flavor
for
sure
i
actually
found
myself
enjoying
a
touch
of
this
one
clean
taste
of
grain
and
bready
malts
light
corn
aftertaste
and
only
the
slightest
bit
of
hops
coming
through
enough
to
dry
off
the
palate
and
ready
it
for
the
next
go
round
ok
i
will
admit
it
a
small
bit
of
me
is
very
hip
now
0
o
a
good
lager
it
keeps
itself
pretty
clean
and
would
be
a
great
backyardbaseball
game
brew
o
its
flavorful
for
a
lager
i
would
probably
try
again
if
it
was
available
in
my
home
state
notes
this
is
a
standout
brew
for
the
style
light
to
moderate
in
body
with
a
lot
of
flavor
easily
drinkable
i
wish
this
one
was
more
widely
available
it
is
the
ideal
lawnmower
beer
o
i
like
it
is
a
nice
plain
ol
beer
o
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
for
the
style
its
incredibly
cheap
fairly
local
to
me
and
oh
so
nonoffensive
the
ultimate
party
beer
no
need
to
do
keg
stands
or
funnels
to
force
it
down
take
your
time
neighbor
its
damn
tasty
overall
it
was
the
old
school
label
that
first
drew
me
in
i
looked
closer
having
moved
recently
to
florida
and
was
appalled
that
i
didnt
grow
up
with
this
being
as
i
am
a
masshole
for
27
years
previous
call
me
a
trendster
if
you
will
but
i
cracked
it
open
simply
excited
for
a
product
of
my
homeland
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
a
perfect
sessioner
d
very
light
but
not
like
a
light
beer
just
easy
to
drink
it
is
slightly
sweet
as
most
adjunct
lagers
go
and
has
a
rounded
finish
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
little
less
zip
in
the
carbonation
like
a
high
life
or
pabst
blue
ribbon
there
is
some
malt
notes
shining
through
the
mediocrity
of
adjunct
flavors
maybe
im
biased
maybe
its
the
tom
brady
special
thats
on
tv
maybe
its
just
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
watery
feel
high
carbonation
and
a
hight
drinkability
if
you
are
looking
to
pound
tasteless
beer
might
be
spot
on
for
the
style
but
that
didnt
make
it
taste
good
for
5
99
a
six
pack
and
a
half
way
decent
ba
rating
i
had
to
grab
this
up
for
a
day
of
outside
work
today
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
pretty
nice
clingy
white
headgood
clarity
and
head
to
this
adj
lager
i
gotta
say
clean
aromas
with
a
bit
of
iron
and
husknot
much
in
the
sweet
department
wich
is
a
good
thin
in
my
mind
what
makes
this
adj
lager
better
than
most
is
the
restrained
sweetness
on
the
palatea
little
grainy
and
husky
with
light
residual
sweetness
in
the
back
end
this
is
a
frisby
golflawn
dayor
sitting
back
watchin
a
ballgame
beerits
not
all
that
bad
at
all
light
and
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
one
of
my
goto
cheap
beers
and
my
favorite
for
the
style
because
it
actually
taste
good
and
is
quite
refreshing
clear
and
golden
yellow
very
bubbly
a
faint
head
with
a
light
ring
of
lace
smells
very
typical
for
this
style
light
malt
and
rice
straw
and
grassy
a
pungent
tang
taste
is
extremely
light
and
carbonated
crisp
grassy
malt
slightly
biscuit
a
faint
hint
of
caramel
malts
with
almost
no
hop
characteristics
light
and
dry
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
a
bunch
go
down
well
while
checking
out
some
music
a
reliable
cheap
night
beer
nothing
overly
excited
me
about
this
beer
its
a
pretty
standard
lager
to
say
the
least
its
got
the
pale
yellow
color
that
were
all
very
familiar
with
a
white
head
thats
not
very
thick
and
dissapears
after
a
sip
or
two
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
old
fasion
look
that
the
can
has
i
dont
give
a
schlitz
for
narragansett
lager
long
live
schlitz
i
really
like
this
beer
got
it
at
trader
joes
in
hartsdale
ny
the
only
place
ive
seen
it
around
my
area
great
american
beer
taste
dry
not
sweet
the
16oz
can
is
the
perfect
size
and
at
1
per
can
easy
on
the
wallet
makes
you
really
pine
for
the
days
when
there
must
have
been
many
local
breweries
that
made
great
beer
before
the
multinationals
engulfed
and
devoured
everything
worthwhile
the
original
beer
of
the
boston
red
sox
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thick
head
taste
is
not
bad
for
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
brew
and
probably
a
great
a
choice
over
the
others
of
this
style
like
bmc
could
defintaly
see
serving
this
to
my
non
craft
loving
friends
pale
straw
color
whispy
white
head
minimal
lacing
corny
biscuity
aroma
light
malt
sweetness
and
nothing
else
taste
is
similar
crisp
some
sort
of
malts
biscuit
and
corn
crisp
light
sharp
feel
drinkability
is
ok
easy
but
not
inviting
in
a
sea
of
minnows
this
is
still
pretty
much
a
minnow
d
pretty
solid
beer
here
from
narragansett
one
of
the
better
examples
i
have
had
this
style
thanks
to
apollokim
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
straw
colored
with
a
nice
white
head
that
slowly
fades
leaving
behind
sticky
lacing
hmmm
an
adjunct
lager
with
an
aroma
nice
smells
kind
of
grainy
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
taste
like
cheerios
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
nice
mouthfill
its
fuller
than
most
bmc
and
more
creamy
carbonation
is
spot
on
if
this
were
readily
available
id
pick
it
up
from
time
to
time
good
beer
for
summer
and
certainly
better
than
bud
coors
miller
this
version
of
narragansett
is
worth
drinking
10
years
ago
not
so
much
pours
well
from
can
light
amber
with
a
decent
head
very
consistent
from
purchase
to
purchase
all
flavors
good
this
is
one
of
the
best
america
adjuncts
available
better
than
bud
as
a
value
and
a
beer
overall
very
good
adjunct
lager
overall
i
actually
prefer
it
out
of
the
can
ill
be
buying
many
more
of
these
when
i
decide
to
go
cheap
palatable
smooth
adjunct
with
a
nice
price
16oz
tall

slight
hops
taste
is
crisp
and
light
mostly
flavor
of
grain
but
a
bit
of
hops
creamy
mouthfeel
good
amount
of
flavor
paired
with
a
nice
smooth
drinkability
at
5
for
a
6
pack
of
tall
boys
this
is
one
of
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
beers
out
there
probably
the
best
adjunct
lager
ive
had
taste
is
fairly
well
balanced
for
an
adjunct
lager
its
crisp
light
a
bit
bitter
and
fairly
fresh
i
mean
its
not
an
amazing
beer
but
its
well
balanced
and
way
more
drinkable
than
most
d
session
beer
for
sure
this
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
toss
out
the
budcoors
and
get
this
instead
poured
gently
with
an
unexpectedly
high
head
of
2fingers
reduces
to
thin
film
with
betteraveragelacing
color
is
clear
straw
yellow
aroma
is
crisp
with
a
touch
of
corn
and
none
of
that
adjunct
skunkiness
taste
is
smooth
no
skunk
or
bad
bitterness
has
corn
on
the
tongue
as
well
this
is
considerably
good
for
an
adjunct
lager
i
really
enjoy
this
would
be
a
great
addition
to
finger
food
d
a
decent
brew
at
a
decent
price
4
99
for
a
6pack
of
tall
boys
its
not
going
to
wow
you
but
it
has
some
character
for
what
its
worth
i
would
take
pbr
over
this
any
day
yeah
thanks
go
out
to
knifestyles
for
this
can
as
repayment
for
the
grain
belt
premo
i
sent
him
little
did
he
know
that
this
is
valuable
tick
for
me
since
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
rhode
island
color
is
well
yellow
tall
white
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
with
few
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
pint
glass
aroma
is
very
grainy
with
a
hint
of
breadiness
and
little
corn
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
this
style
hobs
are
in
there
somewhere
which
a
touch
of
herbal
qualities
and
earthiness
to
the
aroma
much
like
the
smell
very
grainy
very
dry
with
some
decent
biscuitlike
maltiness
bringing
up
the
finish
bitterness
is
low
but
the
hops
do
add
a
bit
of
grassy
flavors
to
the
brew
taste
is
not
light
by
any
means
but
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
lower
carbonation
fuck
yeah
lawnmower
beer
id
drink
thehell
out
of
this
stuff
if
i
could
get
it
regularly
its
still
no
grain
belt
haha
nothing
is
but
its
excellent
for
the
style
thanks
for
the
tick
chris
the
body
is
light
but
has
more
depth
than
a
budweiser
the
carbonation
is
active
and
light
on
the
tongue
overall
a
great
value
at
6
sixpack
of
tallboys
and
it
is
better
than
any
macro
that
i
can
think
of
perfect
golden
pour
with
a
fizzy
white
head
classic
american
lager
here
aroma
is
corn
and
honey
but
not
the
overripe
cabbage
that
some
lesser
brews
have
this
is
beery
beer
taste
is
smooth
carbonated
and
crisp
perfectly
drinkable
brew
nice
grains
and
honey
with
some
hop
flavor
flashes
taste
finishes
dry
but
fresh
but
this
is
a
no
frills
brew
perfect
for
any
time
reminds
me
of
a
much
better
labatt
blue
glad
i
got
to
try
this
brew
a
true
american
original
this
should
be
the
widely
available
brew
here
not
bud
d
refreshing
beer
i
would
definitely
pick
this
beer
over
any
other
american
adjunct
beer
i
have
tried
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
just
the
pbr
of
the
north
east
but
stick
with
pbr
lighter
medium
body
medium
carbonation
drinks
as
well
as
any
other
adjunct
move
along
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
rests
mainly
in
its
accessibility
theres
just
not
enough
character
to
keep
you
wanting
to
come
back
for
more
but
given
limited
options
theres
not
really
anything
to
keep
you
away
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
american
lager
fairly
well
balanced
not
too
bitter
and
it
doesnt
have
those
weird
flavors
some
of
the
big
companies
have
in
their
products
this
beer
seems
more
natural
than
the
better
known
brands
i
wish
it
had
a
better
aroma
and
some
more
bitterness
this
just
might
be
my
new
go
to
beer
when
im
at
a
bar
with
a
poor
craft
beer
selection
or
its
a
hot
summer
day
as
a
rhode
islander
i
felt
obligated
to
try
this
one
i
was
not
disappointed
has
a
slight
sweet
malty
taste
and
mild
aroma
it
has
more
of
an
amber
color
than
most
pale
lagers
ive
tried
the
head
quickly
disappears
though
it
doesnt
look
very
carbonated
you
feel
it
on
you
tongue
highly
drinkable
has
more
taste
than
miller
high
lifemy
favorite
pale
lager
well
used
to
be
i
could
get
used
to
this
one
for
an
inexpensive
six
pack
on
a
sunday
afternoon
this
would
do
the
trick
poured
into
a
standard
pint
with
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
and
a
huge
pillowy
head
with
lots
of
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
like
loads
of
sweet
bread
and
a
decent
musty
scent
taste
is
really
grainy
cereallike
with
a
lot
of
sugar
flavor
and
a
nutty
aftertaste
no
hops
to
speak
of
and
all
flavors
clear
out
pretty
quickly
highly
carbonated
and
very
light
in
body
too
light
for
a
lager
i
would
say
but
considering
the
competition
not
bad
i
like
having
this
around
as
a
cheap
option
that
has
decent
flavor
worlds
better
than
other
cheap
beers
ive
had
and
equally
priced
but
in
a
larger
format
can
great
to
have
around
for
hot
days
or
when
i
want
a
beer
but
dont
want
anything
i
have
to
really
think
about
or
worry
about
savoring
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
straw
color
with
cap
of
soapy
white
head
minimal
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
of
light
grass
hay
and
grain
with
a
faint
touch
of
sweetness
taste
follows
scent
uber
clean
taste
of
fresh
hay
and
grain
with
a
minimal
lightly
sweet
impact
from
the
malt
must
note
there
are
no
vegetable
tastes
associated
with
adjunct
lagers
extremely
light
body
with
moderately
high
carbonation
extremely
clean
and
clear
scent
and
taste
with
no
off
notes
makes
for
a
surprisingly
drinkable
adjunct
lager
this
thing
is
just
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
honestly
its
light
with
absolutely
no
head
there
is
almost
no
smell
on
this
one
and
what
is
there
is
pretty
light
the
taste
where
is
it
anyways
and
i
can
literally
only
drink
one
of
these
before
i
need
something
more
complex
ive
tried
drinking
a
second
and
i
had
to
stop
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
malt
and
a
good
clean
lager
smell
in
the
taste
clean
saaz
hops
and
a
sweet
to
dry
malt
a
small
bite
and
a
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
hop
in
the
aftertaste
nice
clean
lager
nothing
uber
fantastic
but
nice
nonetheless
so
a
tall
can
of
lager
at
least
it
is
made
with
honor
i
am
always
wary
of
that
aluminum
slag
taste
but
if
it
not
in
a
bottle
to
begin
with
then
i
may
never
know
the
difference
there
are
other
perfectly
good
canned
only
beers
out
there
like
oskar
blues
but
enough
of
my
tangent
on
with
the
review
pours
a
bright
gold
like
a
heavenly
halo
smells
of
sweet
grains
and
some
mild
musty
hops
tastes
surprisingly
complex
with
a
creamy
texture
well
balanced
cereal
grains
with
a
crisp
finish
good
job
rhode

now
where
is
my
pawtucket
patriot
its
also
pretty
cheap
which
is
always
good
poured
into
a
pint
glass
bought
a
sixer
the
other
day
thinking
it
would
be
great
around
the
campfire
to
share
with
friends
and
at
5
50
for
a
the
lot
i
say
this
is
going
to
be
a
go
to
decent
purchase
for
company
that
i
dont
want
to
share
my
nice
beer
with
anyhow
as
i
said
before
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
has
a
big
white
head
that
sits
on
top
of
a
clear
light
bodied
yellow
beer
visible
carbonation
and
sticky
lacing
smells
typical
to
the
style
cereal
a
slight
amount
of
hops
and
that
undeniable
smell
of
beer
my
dad
used
to
drink
nostalgic
if
nothing
else
the
taste
isnt
anything
to
shake
a
stick
at
either
pale
malts
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
make
this
exactly
what
i
would
want
from
this
guy
the
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
lively
carbonated
and
light
body
as
for
my
opinion
with
most
adjunct
lagers
they
are
the
epitome
of
drinkable
this
will
certainly
be
around
for
company
and
myself
on
a
side
note
i
was
in
block
island
ri
last
weekend
off
the
coast
of
narragansett
and
in
the
grocery
store
there
was
a
sign
for
narragansett
lager
and
advertised
on
the
sign
was
a
note
saying
that
this
beer
was
rated
an
a
by
the
alstrom
brothers
granted
their
actual
rating
is
not
far
off
from
that

in
anticipation
of
my
trip
to
jamaica
next
week
i
couldnt
remember
the
last
time
i
had
a
red
stripe
but
its
been
years
its
what
you
would
expect
a
little
skunky
and
flavorless
but
refreshing
it
will
be
just
fine
for
consumption
poolside
in
jamaica
but
that
will
probably
be
the
last
time
i
drink
one
until
my
next
trip
to
that
island
nation
ya
mon
overall
this
would
satisfy
me
on
a
hot
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
its
not
offensive
but
i
would
never
seek
this
out
there
are
better
less
expensive
options
available
overall
one
step
better
than
the
average
macro
beer
but
still
a
little
stale
and
watery
overall
im
surprisingly
impressed
by
this
one
its
light
but
what
is
there
is
far
from
bad
certainly
a
few
steps
up
from
a
glass
of
plain
flavorless
alcoholfree
water
this
is
definitely
a
mealtime
beer
rather
than
a
have
one
beer
at
the
end
of
the
day
beer
if
you
feel
like
having
two
or
three
lighter
beers
with
some
good
food
rather
than
one
strong
flavorful
beer
as
a
meal
unto
itself
red
stripe
fills
that
role
nicely
and
i
can
definitely
imagine
this
being
a
good
beer
to
have
around
when
the
weathers
a
bit
warmer
and
youre
chowing
down
on
some
sweet
and
spicy
caribbeanstyle
food
i
may
have
to
revisit
this
one
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
and
ill
definitely
have
to
remember
to
make
sure
to
have
a
few
at
the
source
if
i
ever
end
up
visiting
jamaica
at
some
point
not
much
to
this
enjoyed
it
just
the
same
probably
because
ive
been
drinking
ipas
out
the
wazoo
lately
and
felt
like
something
light
lol
overall
it
feels
like
a
runofthemill
adjunct
lager
without
any
exceptional
flavors
its
definitely
a
taste
i
had
to
get
used
to
its
different
i
get
this
because
its
carribean
and
still
has
carribean
hit
its
just
not
my
go
to
with
options
nice
lager
to
have
with
supper
or
on
the
patio
in
the
summer
classic
bottle
is
always
a
conversation
starter
better
than
bud
all
i
got
to
say
about
it
drink
these
in
jamaica
dont
think
i
will
be
drinking
that
many
more
during
a
beer
drinking
tour
at
a
local
bar
i
discovered
this
little
gem
better
taste
and
smoother
than
other
similar
beers
it
defiantly
surprised
me
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
good
lager
thats
better
in
the
islands
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
red
stripe
and
i
think
it
is
actually
cleaner
and
smoother
than
the
other
beers
within
the
style
taste
is
less
bitter
metallic
corny
a
good
every
day
beer
overall
not
a
good
beer
overall
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
lager
perfect
for
a
hot
summers
day
or
just
washing
down
some
grub
the
corn
adjunct
doesnt
overpower
this
beer
at
all
which
is
a
in
my
books
a
very
good
beer
for
its
style
indeed
would
give
this
a
zero
if
i
could
i
am
not
exaggerating
when
i
say
that
this
tastes
like
corona
extra
and
smells
like
a
wet
dog
i
dont
know
how
this
aroma
was
produced
from
a
beer
but
it
is
awfully
unpleasant
i
really
enjoyed
this
lager
light
and
crisp
as
a
lager
should
be
but
it
has
a
nice
bite
and
some
substantial
flavor
looks
like
an
average
lager
smells
like
canadian
lager
tastes
great
probably
the
best
macro
brew
ive
had
in
ages
it
would
be
great
to
down
on
a
hot
day
or
to
drink
in
multiples
on
a
summer
night
its
not
a
complex
craft
brew
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
its
good
old
fashioned
lager
to
be
swilled
and
enjoyed
try
it
what
do
you
expect
from
a
place
like
this
in
the
us
its
mediocre
at
best
but
for
some
reason
in
jamaica
this
beer
tastes
like
the
nectar
of
the
gods
overall
3
46
id
buy
it
again
it
fit
the
bill
for
the
half
hour
i
was
in
there
its
tasty
even
if
some
of
the
ingredients
taste
stale
and
lowgrade
it
all
comes
together
and
as
i
said
its
a
bit
like
a
stronger
version
of
miller
lite
all
the
way
to
the
dry
finish
just
awful
its
ok
but
ill
eliminate
the
middle
man
and
just
buy
a
six
of
bud
which
i
rate
at
a
3
a
0

deduction
for
not
taking
my
taste
buds
to
da

mon
weighting
appearance

35
mouthfeel
15
overall
20
like
a
lot
of
massproduced
beers
its
grainy
with
a
touch
of
skunk
out
of
the
bottle
but
i
do
know
they
are
clear
not
much
head
golden
maybe
a
tad
bit
darker
side
of
gold
smoothish
decent
carbonation
a
little
sweet
but
a
little
zesty
and
grassy
i
enjoy
red
stripe
but
they
seem
to
catch
up
with
me
pretty
quick
tastes
of
feet
and
rotting
cabbage
3350
beer
of
my
graduation
party
so
it
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
good
for
summer
gatherings
and
goes
down
smooth
solid
option
for
summer
easy
drinking
the
bottle
is
fun
its
jamaican
the
flavor
has
a
little
spice
to
it
hooray
beeyah
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
red
stripe
first
of
all
i
love
the
bottle
it
comes
in
i
get
tired
of
macro
style
lagers
easily
but
red
stripe
i
can
throwback
easily
great
flavor
for
a
beer
of
this
kind
its
island
beer
all
the
way
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
fall
is
here
so
i
stay
away
from
mexican
island
beers
those
are
summer
only
in
my
opinion
very
little
better
than
big
macro
lager
sure
it
used
to
have
more
going
on
this
is
really
not
bad
for
an
adjunct
lager
even
with
that
soapy
taste
i
would
drink
it
again
this
could
be
a
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
drink
it
again
it
might
help
that
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
this
beer
good
beer
fruity
and
easy
to
drink
drank
a
lot
of
this
while
in
jamaica
nice
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
little
more
complexity
and
flavor
than
the
american
big
guns
like
bud
miller
and
coors
still
similar
to
those
though
this
lager
from
jamaica
is
just
okay
enjoy
o
easy
to
drink
and
it
was
refreshing
on
a
warm
afternoon
will
not
seek
out
and
purchase
again
got
a
bottle
from
a
salesman
for
free
and
figured
id
review
it
thin
yellow
with
no
head
after
the
pour
i
couldnt
smell
anything
really
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
mostly
rice
with
a
bite
at
the
finish
that
wasnt
very
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
too
heavily
carbonated
not
for
me
the
one
upside
is
the
packaging
the
stubby
paired
with
the
spot
on
red
and
white
label
is
attractive
and
well
composed
dont
be
fooled
though
the
only
positive
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
does
not
taste
bad
it
makes
it
slips
down
quite
easily
overall
a
rather
nice
3
25
for
red
stripe
jamaican
lager
from
desnoes
geddes
limited
this
is
a
refreshing
jamaican
brew
that
will
go
great
with
any
red
meat
meal
i
will
buy
this
brew
again
red
stripe
jamaican
lager
brewed
by
desnoes
geddes
limited
with
an
abv
of
4
7
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
red
stripe
is
a
filtered
brew
you
can
see
right
though
this
beer
the
smell
is
nice
with
some
grains
nothing
bad
so
far
the
taste
is
smooth
and
clean
you
pick
up
on
some
grain
and
hops
red
stripe
is
a
nice
well
balanced
beer
there
is
nothing
over
powering
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
smoothclean
and
also
refreshing
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
beer
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
of
5
nothing
different
here
maybe
a
notch
better
that
a
typical
light
lager
maybe
its
where
i
live
maybe
its
old
when
it
gets
here
i
have
not
been
to
jamaica
maybe
its
better
there
i
have
had
this
beer
numerous
times
since
i
began
drinking
and
at
first
i
thought
it
was
good
but
i
had
not
really
started
drinking
great
beer
at
that
point
the
last
few
times
i
have
tried
this
one
its
been
a
disappointment
it
has
this
strange
winelike
back
flavor
that
i
just
cant
get
used
to
its
like
a
sour
fruit
taste
very
much
like
a
cheap
wine
less
beer
flavor
maybe
if
i
drank
it
in
jamaica
it
would
taste
better
but
overall
i
would
much
rather
have
a
domestic
or
mexican
adjunct
lager
over
this
lager
for
the
price
its
just
not
all
that
great
o
certainly
better
than
other
beers
in
its
class
but
noting
to
rave
about
overall
a
decent
beer
it
is
not
gonna
win
many
races
for
me
but
is
a
nice
selection
every
now
and
then
at
a
tiki
bar
at
the
beach
overall
if
youre
in
jamaica
where
its
hotter
than
hell
and
the
airs
as
thick
as
soup
i
image
this
is
one
hell
of
a
delicious
thirst
quencher
elsewise
this
is
a
bland
beer
that
i
have
next
to
no
idea
why
people
buy
would
not
recommend
not
even
as
a
party
beer
to
feign
sophistication
its
a
good
beer
but
as
far
as
lagers
go
its
not
my
favorite
this
is
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
during
the
summer
its
very
clear
like
a
lager
should
be
and
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
taste
there
is
a
weird
after
taste
that
lingers
and
isnt
the
best
other
than
that
i
am
overall
happy
with
this
beer
its
been
awhile
since
i
tried
this
beer
and
this
is
better
than
i
remember
i
think
the
last
one
i
had
when
first
available
in
my
area
many
years
ago
was
skunkier
than
this
one
so
maybe
that
one
really
was
brewed
in
jamaica
this
particular
sample
was
quite
refreshing
with
no
offputting
flavors
and
the
bottle
is
a
keeper
if
you
bottle
your
homebrew
average
to
slightly
above
average
this
beer
was
ok
it
was
not
my
favorite
beer
that
i
have
had
but
it
was
ok
it
was
not
my
favorite
beer
i
was
not
too
fond
of
the
taste
i
do
not
know
why
but
this
beer
was
just
not
for
me
but
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
i
would
recommend
it
to
friends
who
like
this
kind
of
beer
though
i
am
still
glad
that
i
tried
it
though
o
the
main
draw
to
this
beer
for
me
is
the
fact
its
a
beer
from
jamaica
similar
to
any
american
macro
lager
its
fine
just
the
same
as
so
many
others
bought
from
a
guy
on
the
side
of
the
road
in
the
hills
above
kingston
jamaica
another
10
years
before
i
try
this
beer
again
jamaican
red
stripe
lager
i
didnt
realize
they
were
11
2
oz
bottle
and
it
really
ticked
me
off
i
hate
getting
jipped
anyway
i
put
that
aside
and
poured
me
one
of
these
little
bottles
and
hoped
for
the
best
well
it
wasnt
entirely
bad
but
it
wasnt
spectacularly
good
either
this
little
brew
does
have
a
nice
dark
golden
hue
to
it
that
is
very
appealing
it
pours
a
nice
pillowy
white
head
with
little
staying
power
but
the
lacing
sticks
around
pretty
good
the
smell
was
disappointing
almost
skunky
but
not
quite
mouthfeel
was
very
very
carbonated
with
a
slightly
sticky
aftertaste
i
did
however
enjoy
the
fullbodied
flavor
the
lager
not
watery
or
plain
hoppy
or
yeasty
overall
it
was
okay
but
i
still
feel
a
bit
cheated
by
the
smaller
bottles
pours
lighter
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
but
not
a
lot
the
aroma
is
of
some
grains
and
yeast
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
actually
better
with
the
grains
yeast
and
a
light
corn
sweetness
and
goes
down
easy
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
good
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
brew
overall
i
think
this
is
a
flavorful
refreshing
beer
and
probably
my
number
one
goto
lager
served
in
a
bottle
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavors
and
aromas
red
stripe
jamaican
for
beer
this
beer
pours
light
with
mild
carbonation
and
produces
a
medium
frothy
head
it
has
a
malty
taste
with
metal
aftertaste
and
you
can
feel
the
carbonation
as
you
drink
it
which
is
on
in
my
opinion
it
is
decent
tasting
filling
but
does
not
cause
much
bloating
overall
it
aint
half
bad
definitely
a
good
session
beer
especially
if
it
is
on
sale
d
as
good
as
but
over
priced
what
is
it
that
people
are
choosing
when
they
choose
red
stripe
a
life
style
the
branding
o
better
then
most
aals
but
also
significantly
more
expensive
its
a
4
because
im
rating
to
style
when
i
think
intoxicants
from
jamaica
beer
isnt
the
first
substance
to
cross
my
mind
red
strip
reaffirms
this
i
had
this
in
jamaica
where
youre
generally
stuck
choosing
between
this
heineken
or
sometimes
guinness
foreign
its
pours
a
typical
straw
color
with
an
unimpressive
head
the
bottle
design
is
sleek
the
smell
is
of
corn
and
grain
and
the
taste
follows
with
a
lot
of
grain
and
some
straw
in
there
the
beer
is
light
and
almost
as
light
as
a
light
beer
the
bottom
line
though
is
that
this
is
just
barely
decent
and
isnt
offensive
at
all
its
a
mild
beer
intended
for
sunny
days
and
spicy
food
both
of
which
jamaica
has
plenty
of
i
consumed
a
fair
number
of
these
in
grad
school
and
return
now
after
a
long
hiatus
had
a
good
old
stubby
bottle
with
a
fried
chicken
dinner
i
still
dig
the
bottles
a
lot
a
light
gold
color
a
hair
darker
than
many
other
aals
with
ample
white
foam
and
an
aroma
full
of
doughy
sweet
lager
malt
a
tangy
fruitiness
and
grassy
mystery
hops
an
old
colleague
used
to
describe
this
beer
as
tasting
like
lawn
clippings
and
i
must
say
i
dont
entirely
agree
i
was
surprised
by
the
rather
moderate
carbonation
for
the
style
relatively
speaking
its
still
fizzy
and
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
does
not
sear
the
tongue
with
scrubbing
bubbles
rather
sweet
with
the
aforementioned
doughy
malt
fruity
hard
candy
notes
sweet
clover
hay
i
dunno
fairly
fragrant
but
not
quite
bright
green
grass
as
per
my
colleagues
review
subdued
nondescript
citrus
rind
and
a
fizzy
lingering
bite

to
enjoy

if
its
on

i
just
got
a
case
the

day
and
wanted
to
review
it
i
enjoy
the

5was
stuck
and
had
no
choice
but
to
revisit
this
like
the
grenade
bottle
but
i
dont
think
red
stripe
is
up
to
the
challenge
i
liked
the
light
version
better
not
offensive
in
the
least
as
many
aals
esp
on
the
finish
overall
its
an
average
run
of
the
mill
aal
nothing
i
would
turn
my
nose
up
at
may
10
2011
the
taste
makes
it
a
forced
intake
not
recommended
and
if
there
is
anything
inherently
jamaican
about
this
beer
i
cant
find
it
pours
a
slog
ty
darker
gold
color
than
many
adjunct
lagers
moderate
cap
of
white
head
gone
quickly
scent
is
mild
and
contains
minimally
sweet
malts
with
faint
vegetal
touches
taste
is
rather
clean
higher
than
expected
maltyness
with
some
grassyness
not
quite
medium
bodied
but
some
more
heft
than
a
typical
adjunct
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
with
decent
maltyness
and
body
the
only
reason
why
i
tried
this
is
because
my
buddy
was
talking
about
it
the
other
day
i
never
tried
it
because
i
never
had
an
interest
in
trying
it
its
better
than
coors
heineken
and
budweiser
for
sure
overall
its
just
the
step
above
macro
a
good
bbq
beer
for
the
people
who
dont
know
better
overall
score4

keeping
in
mind
i
am
comparing
this
beer
to
others
of
its
style
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
is
it
good
enough
to
spend
twice
as
much
on
a
sixpack
as
your
average
preferred
nonimport
brand
probably
not
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
and
worth
a
try
at
least
o
against
its
peers
this
is
a
good
beer
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
if
im
lounging
on
the
beach
boat
or
near
a
grill
theres
something
cool
about
drinking
this
beer
straight
out
of
the
shorty
bottle
on
a
hot
summer
day
hooray
beer
right
overall
not
bad
for
the
style
for
the
price
it
just
isnt
feasible
to
drink
imported
adjunct
lagers
worth
a
try
is
your
down
in
jamaica
or
if
you
can
get
a
single
or
sixer
of
it
otherwise
just
go
with
your
normal
law
mowin
beer
drinks
ok
not
bad
although
not
great
a
bit
pricey
for
what
it
is
and
yet
there
is
nothing
else
quite
like
it
should
you
ever
be
lucky
enough
to
find
yourself
sitting
at
a
thatchedroof
bar
watching
the
clear
blue
waves
lap
at
a
white
sand
beach
in
jamaica
you
will
fervently
hope
that
the
bartender
isnt
too
stoned
to
keep
the
cold
red
stripe
coming
and
if
you
fly
home
to
texas
in
august
youll
find
it
works
just
as
well
here
its
the
best
in
its
category
and
that
is
a
massive
accomplishment
for
any
brewer
hooray
red
stripe
o
maybe
you
have
to
drink
it
in
jamacia
on
the
beach
and
listen
to
reggae
because
in
cold
holland
its
taste
like
a
light
beer
for
after
work
o
a
step
above
the
usual
adjunct
lager
and
is
one
of
few
that
i
believe
is
worth
importing
d
its
a
good
aal
for
me
this
is
a
great
party
beer
for
when
you
dont
want
to
drink
natty
light
or
bud
light
its
smooth
goes
down
easy
and
brings
you
back
for
another
overall
its
pretty
average
a
bit
overpriced
here
in
america
it
will
still
get
the
job
done
though
above
average
for
the
style
refreshingly
crisp
to
drink
the
lack
of
smell
is
annoying
somewhat
although
this
would
be
a
great
session
lager
drinkability
hooray
beer
seriously
not
to
bad
went
well
with
a
spicy
chinese
dish
kung
pao
pork
and
i
suspect
it
would
go
well
with
a
lot
of
other
spicy
dishes
not
a
very
flavorful
beer
but
washes
things
down
nicely
taste
is
maltdominated
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
water
with
sweet
beer
flavoring
aftertaste
is
also
slighly
sugary
drinkability
isnt
great
because
although
it
isnt
offensive
id
order
another
beer
in
its
place
poured
a
clear
sparkling
pale
yellow
with
a
large
fizzy
white
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
pretty
straight
forward
for
a
lager
it
consisted
of
grain
malts
piney
hops
and
a
soapy
yeast
it
tasted
lightly
sweet
and
grainy
at
first
and
ended
about
the
same
with
a
mild
bitter
hint
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
waterycreamy
in
texture
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
overall
just
a
basic
lager
with
not
a
bad
flavor
nice
on
a
hot
day
drinkabilitiy
for
its
style
its
actually
not
so
bad
the
muskiness
seperates
it
from
other
aals
and
is
a
bit
interesting
but
not
particularly
pleasant
better
then
i
expected
not
much
too
it
but
nothing
bad
just
pretty
basic
look
it
isnt
like
i
plan
on
buying
this
beer
anytime
soon
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
still
an
adjunct
lager
it
isnt
a
good
beer
in
the
abstract
rate
red
stripe
to
its
style
rate
it
against
its
peers
and
it
emerges
as
one
of
the
best
of
its
class
i
was
expecting
to
hate
this
i
had
some
snark
all
dialed
up
some
reggae
jokes
and
everything
but
i
cant
hate
this
beer
the
cpj
d
easily
drinkable
lager
with
no
strong
flavours
but
does
wonders
to
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
sunny
day
my
preferred
poolside
beer
while
visiting
jamaica
drinkability
a
beer
good
for
relaxing
on
a
summer
day
i
would
not
pick
this
up
by
my
own
choice
but
i
wouldnt
complain
if
this
is
all
they
had
somewhere
i
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
and
feel
great
the
taste
follows
through
with
some
corn
upfront
with
a
good
deal
of
grain
sweetness
going
along
with
it
finishes
pretty
crisply
but
leaves
behind
a
sugary
grain
sweetness
that
is
certainly
more
than
most
beers
of
this
style
that
said
its
extremely
drinkable
and
i
do
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
its
certainly
better
than
most
adjunct
lagers
and
doesnt
come
across
as
swill
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
an
average
light
lager
feel
perhaps
on
a
warm
jamaican
summer
day
but
not
in
the
middle
of
february
in
maine
d
yes
this
is
called
drinkable
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
refreshing
nonetheless
with
nothing
offensive
great
for
the
summer
or
with
spicy
foods
i
finally
tried
it
on
tap
and
was
very
surprised
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
the
cost
is
also
very
good
smooth
tasting
can
really
drink
alot
of
them
without
getting
too
full
i
really
recommend
this
one
drinkability
besides
a
budweiser
or
heineken
this
is
my
go
to
adjunct
beer
goes
down
easier
than
anything
enjoyed
all
three
without
even
a
piss
break
d
if
i
want
something
really
accessible
there
are
many
worse
choices
than
rs
pretty
decent
drinkable
d
compared
to
other
beers
in
this
style
red
stripe
is
very
drinkable
although
the
sweetness
would
keep
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
pale
strawyellow
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
ring
of
head
the
beer
has
a
slightly
sour
tone
to
its
smell
but
mostly
grains
flavor
is
also
slightly
sour
but
it
helps
to
balance
the
grainy
and
slightly
spiced
taste
characteristics
very
light
in
mouth
with
an
extremely
smooth
finish
aftertaste
is
a
bit
musty
but
dry
which
beckons
for
a
followup
sip
great
beer
for
the
beach
especially
in
jamaica
poured
from
12oz
bottle
no
date
into
dimpled
mug
or
outright
when
im
partying
havent
had
this
since
college
from
notes
poured
pale
clear
yellow
with
thick
foamy
white
head
much
lacing
faint
malt
aroma
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hay
thin
flavour
a
little
malt
sweetness
a
little
bitter
thin
finish
on
a
light
body
not
much
i
can
say
about
this
beer
but
is
quite
freshing
on
a
warmhot
day
and
when
the
mood
is
right
got
some
red
stripe
today
for
our
super
bowl
beer
just
something
that
can
go
down
easy
and
everyone
could
enjoy
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
so
that
wasnt
doing
it
any
favors
smell
was
pretty
simple
kind
of
earthy
and
floral
but
was
weak
taste
wise
it
isnt
very
complex
but
compared
to
other
adjuncts
its
quite
good
it
starts
off
sweet
then
finishes
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
is
kind
of
watery
though
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
light
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
see
a
sixer
going
down
quickly
all
in
all
its
a
good
beer
for
its
style
and
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
it
is
pricey
however
and
that
will
likely
keep
me
from
buying
more
great
drink
im
sure
this
would
be
a
wonderful
brew
in
warmer
weather
i
might
have
to
test
that
this
summer
great
brew
going
to
have
to
get
it
again
as
well
as
thank
my
grandfather
for
having
me
try
it
easy
drinker
on
the
beach
preferabley
rockin
the
roots
bland
and
typical
lager
feel
glad
ive
only
got
to
have
one
can
the
bottle
i
reviewed
was
a
bit
better
thank
goodness
red
stripe
the
consumate
lager
of
the
the
tropics
jamaicas
own
pours
a
american
adjunct
pale
yellow
head
recedes
quickly
crisp
mouthfeel
and
is
pleasant
but
the
taste
is
funky
for
me
and
would
not
be
drinking
this
as
a
session
beer
i
like
to
try
again
with
cuisine
that
befits
this
lager
perfect
on
a
hot
summers
day
when
you
want
a
cheap
beverage
you
dont
have
to
concentrate
much
on
d
gimmick
macroimport
adjunct
lager
for
me
save
your
money
for
the
good
stuff
when
pouring
the
foam
was
white
in
color
and
thin
the
color
was
deep
gold
with
yellow
highlights
it
had
an
overall
balance
of
wheat
hops
and
barley
with
hints
of
citrus
and
flowers
the
taste
was
identical
to
the
aroma
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
crisp
drinkability
not
too
bad
kind
of
has
a
summer
feel
to
it
due
to
the
citrus
and
flowery
tones
ok
session
drinkability
this
isnt
a
standout
for
flavor
but
it
sure
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
its
a
refreshing
lager
but
thats
where
the
complexity
stops
definitely
drinkable
nice
easy
drinking
lager
for
hot
days
or
hot
foods
slightly
sweet
i
swear
the
pint
sized
can
tastes
different
than
the
shorty
bottle
its
been
a
few
years
since
i
had
one
but
had
countless
ones
of
these
in
the
past
when
i
used
to
hang
out
at
the
royal
rack
reggae
pool
hall
so
i
have
fond
memories
but
really
it
tastes
like
most
massed
produced
central
american
lagers
a
decent
adjunct
lager
for
drinking
in
mass
quanitities
without
getting
too
hammered
to
that
end
it
is
very
drinkable
poured
from
a
330
ml
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
mild
white
foam
that
seemed
to
disappear
quickly
plenty
of
carbonation
and
some
mild
lacing
a
light
golden
colour
not
real
impressive
smell
or
taste
but
better
than
some
macrolagers
i
seem
to
remember
this
more
fondly
but
it
was
in
the
sun
and
i
was
really
thirsty
malts
are
weak
and
not
too
much
else
going
for
it
i
guess
i
should
not
have
drank
a
dab
prior
to
this
i
do
like
the
stubby
painted
bottle
mouthfeel
is
average
light
bodied
and
some
effervescence
drinkability
would
be
improved
by
warm
sun
blue
clear
waters
and
coconut
oil
will
try
again
under
those
circumstances
d
very
enjoyable
for
a
lager
when
im
at
places
that
tend
not
to
have
a
craft
selection
this
is
usually
what
i
go
for
a
bit
expensive
for
what
it
is
but
what
isnt
these
days
dif
you
can
drink
water
you
can
drink
this
thank
god
for
the
marketing
team
because
they
would
not
sell
any
of
this
stuff
without
their
efforts
all
in
all
red
stripe
has
some
funny
commercials
and
ill
have
one
from
time
to
time
but
there
are
better
beers
out
there
for
me
d
very
drinkable
as
it
is
for
all
the
beers
of
the
style
just
wont
keep
my
attention
i
swear
i
have
reviewed
this
beer
before
but
yet
it
says
i
dont
anyway
ive
had
this
several
times
from
the
bottle
pours
a
light
strawish
yellow
actually
has
pretty
good
carbonation
but
is
very
watery
the
aroma
is
skunky
mostly
with
a
little
hops
the
taste
is
mostly
skunky
but
has
a
terrible
harsh
bitter
finish
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
adjuncts
because
of
the
finish
would
rather
have
a
bmc
nice
light
and
golden
color
when
poured
while
a
decent
white
head
forms
and
then
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
sweet
corn
grain
and
cooked
veggies
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
hints
of
light
grain
husks
while
maintaining
a
favorable
hoppy
bitterness
in
each
sip
overall
its
a
light
bodied
low
abv
easy
drinking
lager
in
my
opinion
red
stripe
is
criminally
underrated
this
beer
is
excellent
it
pours
a
smooth
rich
golden
color
has
the
perfect
amount
of
head
medium
carbonation
and
a
sweet
sugary
taste
to
it
this
beer
is
crisp
and
goes
down
well
a
perfect
companion
to
a
barbeque
or
steak
dinner
very
good
definitely
is
one
of
the
better
lagers
dr
brilliant
for
this
price
range
but
nothing
special
in
terms
of
the
style
a
good
brew
in
hot
or
warm
weather
light
crisp
refreshing
tastes
best
on
tap
especially
down
in
jamaica
pairs
well
with
spicy
food
jerk
especially
but
also
with
seafood
or
salty
dishes
not
much
there
in
terms
of
aroma
or
flavor
but
its
not
trying
to
be
a
hop
bomb
or
malty
brew
drank
this
for
ten
days
during
my
honeymoon
in
jamaica
a
very
drinkable
beer
almost
like
water
this
is
so
much
better
on
draft
than
from
bottle
imo
doesnt
taste
all
that
great
back
in
the
states
d
easy
to
drink
after
getting
past
the
funky
musty
smell
the
abv
is
just
right
for
the
style
and
makes
this
all
the
more
drinkable
well
crafted
if
you
can
say
that
about
a
style
that
eschews
craft
and
pairs
well
with
food
collard
greens
and
black
eyed
peas
tonight
rated
to
style
conclusion
while
this
may
be
swill
it
is
at
least
distinctive
in
its
swillness
given
its
style
it
was
not
good
or
bad
it
was
simply
eeehh
take
it
or
leave
it
mahn
sometimes
to
appreciate
the
good
beers
you
have
to
drink
the
ehh
beers
and
the
bad
beers
thankfully
red
stripe
is
one
of
the
eehhh
beers
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
smell
that
thankfully
doesnt
match
the
taste
it
is
definetly
a
very
light
beer
in
comparison
to
microbrews
but
still
has
a
fair
amount
more
flavor
that
standard
macro
brews
overall
though
it
is
very
easy
drinking
its
hard
to
believe
they
make
a
light
form
of
this
somthing
different
than
bud
or
miller
but
not
anything
even
close
to
rave
about
conclusion
for
this
style
this
is
a
good
beer
and
is
better
than
most
of
the
big
macros
this
may
have
been
a
bad
batch
will
definitely
retry
tastes
like
sweet
grain
with
a
metallic
taste
in
there
this
better
be
served
cold
or
would
be
skunky
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
warmer
it
gets
sitting
there
the
lousier
the
taste
still
more
flavor
than
most
american
lagers
a
little
more
coloration
all
things
considered
it
could
go
with
a
lot
of
different
types
of
food
just
serve
it
cold
d
an
average
beer
for
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
good
taste
i
would
definitely
pick
this
over
most
of
the
macros
but
at
the
price
of
a
6pack
there
are
better
options
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
though
back
in
the
1980s
in
the
uk
there
was
a
variant
of
red
stripe
called
crucial
brew
it
was
a
knock
off
of
carlsberg
special
brew
the
crucial
brew
came
in
black
cans
with
a
red
stripe
on
it
and
was
a
high
alcohol
lager
probably
verging
on
being
a
malt
liquor
overall
impression
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
and
once
did
for
a
week
straight
d
good
light
refreshing
beer
highly
drinkable
good
to
wash
down
just
about
any
type
of
food
with
drinkability
when
tasting
this
critically
this
is
actually
fairly
good
for
the
style
nice
and
sweet
i
appreciate
the
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
maybe
my
new
go
to
cheap
beer
i
could
six
this
a
lot
more
easily
than
others
in
this
style
light
to
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
and
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
not
the
worse
adjunct
lager
i
have
had
but
not
something
i
will
try
to
seek
out
either
d
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
this
is
definitely
toward
the
top
end
of
things
not
terrible
at
all
and
heck
even
the
light
version
is
pretty
decent
mouthfeel
is
ok
with
light
body
and
sparkling
carbonation
not
the
most
drinkable
but
better
that
some
adjunct
lagers
ok
on
the
beach
when
its
hot
out
decent
drinkability
the
kickoff
to
the
epic
swill
tour
2010
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
like
my
fathers
jokes
is
quite
corny
both
in
terms
of
cob
and
syrup
some
old
wheat
and
grass
back
that
up
the
taste
resembles
the
smell
but
with
more
hard
water
in
there
i
dont
think
my
nose
can
detect
hardness
what
keeps
me
from
turning
up
my
mouths
nose
at
this
is
the
virtual
lack
of
an
aftertaste
if
there
was
the
usual
shitty
aftertaste
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
finish
my
partial
pour
the
body
is
decidedly
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
pretty
watery
feel
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
this
but
i
also
wont
necessarily
cringe
in
terror
if
its
offered
to
me
poured
a
good
three
finger
head
which
is
still
going
strong
after
four
minutes
best
head
to
date
maybe
it
is
the
weather
color
is
a
golden
amber
of
a
6
on
the
srm
chart
the
head
is
what
bring
the
appearance
score
up
the
aroma
is
that
of
stored
straw
nice
and
dry
with
a
little
fragrance
of
clover
i
was
slightly
taken
back
with
the
flavor
not
quite
the
same
as
the
smell
there
is
a
sweet
malt
over
a
main
flavor
of
wheat
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
well
enough
blend
of
flavor
to
keep
me
drinking
grows
in
me
as
the
temperature
gets
warmer
and
the
alcohol
takes
effect
sort
of
pricey
for
the
flavor
but
for
some
events
this
would
be
a
worth
while
addition
not
a
normal
staple
for
the
discerning
beer
drinker
this
one
pours
a
clear
lighter
golden
color
with
all
of
its
head
fading
as
fast
as
possible
though
coarse
bubbles
do
continue
to
flow
up
through
it
the
nose
consists
of
malty
sweetness
upfront
and
eventually
degrades
into
the
sharp
rice
liquor
smell
that
defines
the
aal
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
smell
the
cornmalt
sweetness
is
then
followed
by
a
sharp
bitterness
that
is
honestly
the
only
thing
bad
about
the
flavor
there
is
hints
of
breadiness
from
the
yeast
the
weird
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
i
honestly
think
that
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
which
is
weird
for
a
beer
of
lower
abv
the
body
is
light
as
would
be
expected
but
the
corn
syrupiness
isnt
that
pleasant
its
decently
drinkable
if
you
are
looking
for
the
oxymoron
that
is
a
quality
american
adjunct
lager
then
this
is
the
one
other
than
that
there
are
better
things
out
there
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
coworkers
spoke
respecfully
of
it
and
i
enjoy
some
of
their
commercials
sorry
poured
a
big
head
which
died
fast
and
faint
straw
yellow
in
color
smelled
a
tiny
touch
skunked
clear
glass
again
but
not
enough
to
make
it
undrinkable
mildy
sweet
and
along
the
bmc
american
style
i
noted
immediately
though
this
wasnt
sitting
well
in
my
stomach
sort
of
the
same
feeling
when
im
drinking
a
really
cheap
cruddy
wine
like
the
stomach
saying
do
you
honestly
plan
on
filling
me
with
this
really
d
terrible
for
sure
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
d
okay
drinkability
when
its
cold
as
it
warms
it
gets
pretty
gross
refreshing
when
it
is
icy
cold
on
a
hot
day
on
the
beach
drinkability
good
for
thirst
quenching
or
refreshment
not
so
much
for
taste
d
like
it
on
a
hot
day
dont
get
it
twisted
there
is
nothing
jamaican
about
this
beer
this
really
is
akin
to
a
cheap
american
adjunct
milwaukee
bestlike
cheap
dressed
in
a
sexy
bottle
and
imported
i
wont
stop
drinking
red
stripe
but
ill
probably
never
buy
it
myself
d
this
is
always
an
enjoyable
brew
and
usually
readily
available
drinkability
havent
had
this
beer
for
about
2
yrs
not
as
good
as
i
remember
i
can
drink
it
but
definitely
nothing
special
i
would
however
choose
this
over
most
macro
brews
d
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
and
refresher
in
hot
weather
rjt
never
had
it
on
tap
but
i
have
been
told
it
is
better
when
i
was
in
tempe
az
attending
asu
there
was
a
bar
called
mcduffys
near
my
apartment
they
would
serve
25
cent
redstripes
from
8
to
10pm
mth
we
went
there
one
night
and
drink
2
of
red
stripes
in
2
hours
it
was
super
gross
this
beer
is
not
as
good
in
the
states
is
it
the
romance
of
being
on
a
beach
in
paradise
or
is
beer
just
better
the
closer
you
are
to
the
source
some
say
red
stripe
tastes
a
little
rubbery
i
thought
that
after
my
first
sip
but
once
i
continued
and
finished
the
beer
it
was
actually
a
little
sweet
and
refreshing
the
second
time
i
had
it
there
was
no
hint
of
rubbery
synthetics
and
it
was
the
best
tasting
beer
among
the
selection
of
harpoon
corona
and
circus
boy
d
quiet
drinkable
yet
seeming
expensive
compared
to
similar
beers
within
the
style
almost
worth
the
price
may
stock
the
basement
fridge
with
a
case
for
bmc
friends
that
find
even
a
newcastle
to
unlike
blight
and
for
my
own
enjoyment
when
a
lager
is
desired
this
is
a
good
lager
for
being
an
island
type
beer
and
light
it
holds
a
good
flavor
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
fruitiness
that
i
cannot
pinpoint
but
i
do
enjoy
it
if
your
looking
for
a
lighter
beer
with
some
good
flavor
on
a
summer
day
this
would
be
a
good
choice
their
bottle
design
is
unique
as
well
pours
a
very
pale
yellowgold
color
with
a
white
head
that
is
quickly
gone
smells
like
champagne
taste
is
a
pretty
normal
lager
flavor
but
dialed
back
about
50
just
not
a
lot
of
taste
the
end
is
crisp
and
a
little
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
overall
i
could
drink
this
again
but
i
dont
really
enjoy
it
12
ounce
bottle
ive
always
appreciated
the
craftsmanship
of
red
stripe
from
the
shortened
nonexistent
really
neck
down
to
the
painted
label
red
stripe
has
also
been
one
of
my
standbys
something
to
drink
when
theres
nothing
else
around
or
no
other
real
options
when
im
at
a
restaraunt
or
bar
pours
a
light
straw
with
some
mild
carbonation
volumous
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
light
cereal
aroma
not
much
else
going
on
great
mouthfeel
the
beer
isnt
overly
carbonated
mild
cereal
notes
yield
to
a
super
crisp
and
super
clean
finish
theres
a
reason
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
for
so
long
im
not
a
fan
of
lagers
really
particularly
light
lagers
so
a
beer
like
this
really
has
to
work
to
impress
me
red
stripe
does
that
im
always
worried
that
im
going
to
get
the
bitterness
or
skunkiness
that
i
find
in
some
of
the
macro
beers
or
in
the
green
bottle
european
styles
but
its
always
crisp
fresh
and
clean
its
one
of
those
beers
that
just
leaves
you
wanting
to
drink
more
as
you
go
along
probably
one
of
the
best
versions
of
this
style
of
beer
that
you
can
find
youve
got
a
pale
gold
bubbly
beverage
with
nice
finger
of
creamy
white
head
nose
of
faint
sulfer
and
grain
palate
is
smooth
with
lightly
applied
flavors
of
hop
bitter
overall
grain
and
dryness
combined
in
a
way
to
be
refreshing
and
repeatedly
drinkable
drinkability
definitely
a
good
refreshing
beer
its
simple
and
uncomplex
but
not
offensive
in
anyway
maybe
a
touch
sweet
but
overall
a
simple
summer
refresher
thats
still
quite
a
bit
better
then
a
lot
of
the
mass
produced
stuff
in
that
at
least
it
still
has
some
flavor
i
had
had
red
stripe
a
number
of
separate
occasions
over
the
years
and
remember
regarding
it
as
being
an
ordinary
if
forgettable
beer
revisiting
it
now
id
like
to
go
back
on
anything
remotely
pleasant
or
even
polite
that
i
ever
had
to
say
about
it
this
is
not
only
emasculated
its
a
displeasing
dreadful
and
downright
detestable
excuse
for
a
beer
this
beer
is
just
ok
cant
say
its
my
favorite
probably
wont
have
it
again
p
s
best
drunk
straight
from
the
bottle
so
it
stays
simple
and
rereshing
cool
bottle
still
nothing
crazy
awesome
but
a
good
drinkable
lager
d
i
drank
this
one
before
i
knew
it
i
wish
i
hadnt
just
bought
one
sad
day
drinkability
its
not
too
sharp
in
the
mouth
to
chug
pleasant
enough
to
the
senses
to
sip
and
strong
enough
to
get
me
drunk
very
good
drinkability
is
good
if
the
budget
is
tight
it
is
a
better
buy
than
a
lot
of
other
aals
d
not
terrible
for
an
aal
hard
to
beleive
how
much
of
this
ive
drank
in
my
life
actually
sitting
down
and
reviewing
this
beer
it
low
points
are
way
evident
weird
metal
tastes
and
a
lack
of
depth
i
suppose
its
decent
for
the
style
but
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
overall
a
good
beer
in
a
brown
bottle
which
is
good
bad
that
it
is
only
11
2
oz
instead
of
traditional
12
oz
bottle
the
taste
of
hops
is
indescribable
but
makes
you
want
more
drinkability
is
only
average
after
3
drinkablity
weakens
so
dramatically
drinkability
is
actually
decent
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
while
but
i
can
remember
easily
drinking
7
or
8
of
these
in
a
night
at
a
bar
or
two
poured
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
single
finger
white
head
which
dissappeared
quickly
to
thin
lacing
aromas
balanced
of
sweet
grassy
hops
and
malts
slightly
sweet
malt
tones
on
the
palatte
with
a
fair
enough
hoppy
finish
much
in
the
same
way
it
smells
decent
lager
with
a
light
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
would
give
it
a
two
thumbs
up
overall
a
mess
and
dont
recommend
i
havent
had
one
of
these
in
at
least
15
years
before
i
discovered
craft
beers
back
then
i
liked
it
which
was
probably
helped
by
the
marketing
was
hoping
it
held
up
a
little
over
the
years
but
it
didnt
time
to
retire
this
one
for
good
nn
dnot
a
bad
beer
when
paired
with
some
food
as
a
stand
alone
beer
its
so
so
taste
follows
the
nose
a
bit
stale
but
not
horrible
up
front
is
a
quick
touch
of
citrus
then
malt
kicks
in
to
give
a
bit
of
sweetness
its
light
tasting
light
feeling
but
still
has
a
husky
aftertaste
good
when
drank
very
cold
this
beer
poured
a
white
medium
head
that
quickly
disappeared
the
body
of
this
beer
was
very
light
the
smell
was
a
blend
of
yeast
cereal
grains
and
maybe
rice
this
beer
really
didnt
have
a
taste
maybe
carbonated
sour
water
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
like
water
is
i
cant
believe
red
stripe
was
brewing
this
beer
for
75
years
1935
this
beer
has
anheuse
busch
miller
and
coors
presences
all
over
it
if
you
like
commercial
american
beers
you
will
love
it
but
you
get
to
pay
import
prices
for
it
if
you
like
red
stripe
save
your
money
pour
some
bud
light
into
red
stripe
bottles
decent
drinkability
for
the
type
its
a
worthy
beer
repeatdrinkability
is
high
it
feels
light
enough
in
body
and
abv
to
allow
for
you
to
have
a
few
in
a
row
just
fine
pours
a
pale
clear
light
gold
medium
sized
head
dissipates
quickly
light
sweet
malty
smell
taste
is
immediately
sweet
becoming
grainy
with
some
herbal
notes
in
the
finish
pretty
flavorful
for
the
style
well
carbonated
and
light
bodied
very
drinkable
nice
typical
beer
recommended
for
summer
cookouts
etc
hooray
beer
for
the
uninitiated
one
of
the
greatest
benefits
of
the
canquest
is
the
aural
pleasure
accompanying
the
crrack
glug
and
fizz
as
the
can
is
opened
and
poured
into
a
glass
i
mention
this
because
this
can
was
an
excellent
example
of
the
phenomenon
i
was
left
with
barely
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
excellent
retention
on
this
hot
hazy
humid
afternoon
hey
call
me
a
sissy
but
this
was
a
fizzy
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
i
was
looking
forward
to
it
the
nose
was
sweet
rich
with
cereal
adjuncts
hey
if
you
want
the
canquest
to
review
better
beers
sendtrade
me
for
some
in
the
meantime
i
am
becoming
eminently
familiar
with
the
style
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
the
characteristic
lager
sweetness
offset
by
adjuncts
frankly
if
you
have
tried
one
you
can
rest
easy
if
there
are
others
you
may
have
missed
finish
was
slightly
sweet
right
for
the
style
cold
and
wet
on
a
hot
day
this
goes
into
a
lot
of
coolers
so
why
not
mine
id
like
it
better
on
hula
in
the
coola
day
because
it
would
evoke
memories
of
days
like
these
d
nice
lager
and
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
florida
day
really
not
surprising
but
very
easy
to
drink
pass
will
drink
again
this
is
a
good
lager
jamaican
style
like
this
with
pizza
or
barbecue
prefer
it
medium
cool
really
a
typical
example
of
the
style
but
very
enjoyable
when
the
temperature
rises
if
youre
at
a
cookout
why
not
recommended
this
is
good
lawnmower
beer
this
is
something
i
could
enjoy
knocking
back
after
working
in
the
yard
its
thirst
quenching
simple
and
clean
it
also
has
little
bit
more
flavour
than
bud
miller
coors
and
much
of
the
like
my
only
complaint
is
the
bottle
sure
its
distinctive
but
its
too
small
it
literally
holds
11
2
fluid
ounces
which
of
course
is
less
than
a
typical
beer
i
was
not
aware
of
this
i
guess
ive
gotten
too
used
to
the
long
neck
styled
bottle
because
my
mouth
expected
the
opening
of
the
bottle
to
be
there
when
my
hand
was
the
normal
distance
away
oh
well
ill
have
to
adapt
because
im
thinking
about
picking
up
a
6pack
for
a
pool
party
tonight
red
stripe
pours
a
light
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
head
that
fades
quickly
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
some
light
tropical
fruit
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
with
some
hints
of
fragrant
apple
and
pear
overall
red
stripe
is
a
refreshing
beer
but
not
much
going
on
flavorwise
its
not
too
carbonated
drinks
eady
good
sessionable
beer
for
warm
weather
drinkability
overall
nothing
special
however
for
the
style
this
beer
is
very
good
and
id
be
willing
to
have
it
again
though
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
when
beer
shopping
red
stripe
hooray
canada
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
was
a
straw
yellow
with
medium
sized
head
that
laced
away
fairly
quickly
moderately
active
carbonation
smell
was
lightly
of
grain
with
a
little
hint
of
citrus
tasted
of
fresh
grain
with
a
slight
crisp
hop
finish
fairly
good
drinking
beverage
on
a
hot
day
a
simple
and
straight
forward
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
big
fluffy
white
head
it
is
straw
colored
and
clear
the
smell
is
very
sweet
i
get
white
grape
or
my
allergies
are
screwing
with
me
after
mowing
the
lawn
i
dont
get
a
whole
lot
on
the
taste
it
is
dry
and
crisp
it
goes
down
pretty
well
since
i
taste
nothing
taste
is
not
all
that
bad
and
i
am
actually
pretty
impressed
for
the
style
has
a
somewhat
creamy
body
and
displays
minimal
cardboard
aspects
that
i
find
inherent
with
most
any
aal
taste
is
light
and
could
use
some
more
grains
and
even
some
more
sweetness
as
it
is
now
it
is
pretty
decently
balanced
but
that
just
means
minimalistic
hops
and
malt
i
dont
see
a
whole
lot
wrong
with
this
beer
and
it
is
much
more
drinkable
than
your
average
macro
lager
not
half
bad
i
would
take
this
over
a
bud
or
corona
anyday
red
stripe
is
better
than
most
adjunctlagers
it
tastes
more
like
a
germanpilsner
than
an
adjunctlager
i
think
this
beer
would
be
really
good
on
a
hot
day
its
refreshing
and
smooth
beer
is
beer
and
when
youre
sitting
around
with
your
buddies
and
they
toss
you
a
red
stripe
you
got
to
take
it
for
what
it
is
and
just
enjoy
life
there
are
some
decent
aals
out
there
and
while
this
is
better
than
bmc
you
should
prob
avoid
this
one
is
generally
drinkable
all
the
more
so
because
its
not
the
horrible
swill
youre
limited
to
when
all
you
can
have
is
an
adjunct
if
thats
all
your
selection
pick
this
one
up
first
also
ive
never
found
a
beer
with
a
more
satisfying
bottle
i
usually
keep
holding
it
for
15
minutes
after
i
finish
just
for
the
hell
of
it
cheers
the
body
is
decently
crisp
though
a
little
thin
flavors
of
buttered
bread
sweet
corn
honey
crackers
and
just
a
twinge
of
hops
on
the
finish
for
an
adjunct
this
is
decent
pretty
refreshing
really
and
for
this
price
i
could
have
this
again
notes
overall
red
stripe
is
a
beer
that
is
imo
best
for
fall
drinking
not
a
summer
beer
or
a
spring
one
not
refreshing
enough
i
was
expecting
worse
given
the
fact
that
my
last
red
stripe
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
i
knew
it
had
to
have
been
off
this
one
doesnt
taste
off
its
just
really
not
too
good
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
i
kind
of
only
bought
it
to
add
a
notch
to
my
country
list
i
also
hadnt
yet
reviewed
an
american
adjunct
lager
kind
of
lame
they
brew
it
in
canada
does
this
really
count
as
a
jamaican
beer
then
overall
i
imagine
this
would
go
well
with
mexicancaribbean
food
underrated
hooray
beer
taste
is
similar
to
alot
of
lagers
that
ive
had
domestically
light
and
refreshing
with
a
fizz
to
it
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
given
the
opportunity
a
friend
gave
me
this
bottle
so
i
dont
know
the
cost
but
i
can
only
imagine
that
similar
domestic
beers
can
be
had
for
less
cost
light
and
malty
its
very
and
bad
worth
skippng
and
bland
skip
it
also
its
sharp
and
leaves
a
really
fuznky
after
taste
its
just
a
bad
beer
drinkability
quite
frankly
this
is
better
right
out
of
the
bottle
numerous
people
said
i
would
like
this
not
even
knowing
my
style
preferences
and
yet
they
were
right
14
for
a
6pack
is
too
much
and
yet
this
is
what
it
felt
like
to
drink
from
a
stubby
back
in
the
day
neat
24
oz
bottle
i
like
the
stout
bottle
poured
lighter
than
almost
any
beer
ive
ever
seen
with
an
actual
head
though
something
to
be
proud
of
doesnt
smell
like
much
of
anything
and
tastes
of
sweet
corn
maltodextrin
and
fresh
yeasty
bread
very
decent
just
completely
mild
and
unassuming
a
bit
of
upfront
and
mid
fruit
flavor
honey
lemonish
all
in
all
not
bad
fingers
worth
of
bone
white
head
loosely
knit
and
without
much
retention
a
touch
of
lacing
here
or
there
clear
transparent
yelloworange
in
color
nothing
too
distinctive
about
it
lightens
a
bit
at
the
rims
the
nose
has
lots
of
corn
syrup
pretzel
dough
cereal
grains
semisour
nature
to
the
apricot
apple
scents
some
spice
and
wet
minerally
earth
comes
through
with
a
big
swirl
inside
the
glass
mediumbodied
more
heavy
than
dense
frontloaded
into
the
mouth
entry
declining
from
there
the
carbonation
is
flatfooted
and
cant
seem
to
get
anything
moving
the
malts
add
smoothness
to
the
texture
but
not
only
minimal
sweetness
the
seems
mostly
to
come
from
the
corn
grains
and
apricot
pear
apple
fruit
the
spiciness
is
still
there
and
adds
some
life
as
does
the
lemon
peel
notes
the
thing
here
is
that
this
is
an
überfriendly
beer
that
deserves
better
than
intellectual
analysis
its
all
about
context
although
this
is
a
decent
mass
distributed
lager
i
would
much
rather
save
my
money
and
just
buy
some
natural
light
or
miller
light
and
get
the
same
effects
as
the
red
stripe
d
this
beer
is
an
excellent
example
of
its
style
and
goes
down
easy
it
is
versatile
and
goes
well
with
food
especially
with
piquant
or
heavily
spiced
foods
including
the
obvious
choice
of
jerked
dishes
d
nothing
outstanding
here
but
special
to
me
as
it
was
the
first
beer
that
i
ever
drank
not
my
favorite
but
it
always
brings
a
smile
this
is
a
tasty
american
adjunct
lager
and
more
interesting
than
the
average
this
is
a
must
try
at
the
beach
and
makes
me
look
forward
to
the
warmer
days
ahead
pours
a
light

the

slight

note
light

not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
d
for
the
price
about
8six
around
here
its
basically
a
novelty
lawnmower
beer
that
you
enjoy
once
a
summer
when
youre
randomly
in
the
mood
still
a
helluva
step
up
from
its
distant
cousin
corona
drinkability
i
definitely
wouldnt
session
this
beer
unless
i
was
laying
on
a
beach
in
jamaica
and
even
then
id
look
for
something
better
but
its
not
horrible
either
a
very
adequate
adjunct
lager
once
you
can
get
past
the
smell
we
found
ourselves
at
our
house
on
huntington
ave
on
sat
night
they
do
not
have
a
great
selection
of
beers
here
so
i
decided
to
ordered
a
beer
that
i
have
not
had
in
a
while
thus
red
stripe
now
i
did
not
pour
it
into
a
glass
as
the
rs
bottle
is
cool
enough
to
drink
out
of
thus
i
have
to
give
the
appearance
just
an
average
score
smell
was
just
average
too
nothing
special
taste
was
better
most
adjunct
lagers
as
it
wasnt
totally
repulsive
actually
i
didnt
mind
it
at
all
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
nondescript
but
thats
the
point
drinkability
is
why
you
buy
this
beer
goes
down
so
smooth
and
since
the
taste
isnt
half
bad
it
gets
high
scores
its
good
day
or
night
indoors
or
outdoors
wherever
you
may
be
even
if
not
on
a
beach
mouthfeel
is
very
light
bodied
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
easy
to
drink
a
ton
of
on
a
hot
day
the
mouthfeel
diminishes
halfway
through
loses
that
little
fruity
appeal
but
then
the
drinkability
would
be
good
if
the
stuff
wasnt
a
little
more
expensive
than
it
should
be
for
what
goes
into
it
marketing
not
alot
of
character
or
flavor
a
lighter
beer
nondescript
really
not
alot
to
say
about
it
good
or
bad
typical
golden
lager
light
crisp
taste
drinkability
is
average
as
the
smell
just
really
gets
in
the
way
drinkability
its
much
better
than
your
average
convenience
store
macro
from
st
louis
or
milwaukee
red
stripe
is
refreshing
and
has
quality
flavor
its
more
than
decent
d
drinkability
is
different
but
i
would
much
rather
have
a
wheat
beer
rather
than
a
lighter
lager
to
wash
down
dinner
3
55
as
far
as
flavor
aroma
etc
its
doesnt
stand
out
much
from
any
macro
swill
so
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
it
at
the
lower
abv
its
something
you
can
enjoy
early
and
often
pours
a
rusty
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
smells
of
sour
yeast
grass
corn
hay
and
semi
floral
not
too
pleasant
not
a
lot
of
flavors
stick
out
in
this
one
compared
to
any
macro
you
dont
get
that
metallic
taste
which
is
always
nice
light
maltiness
and
lower
carbonation
than
most
macros
my
girlfriend
loves
this
beer
but
american
lagers
jamaican
or
not
are
just
not
my
style
drinkability
a
very
sessionable
beer
especially
when
compared
to
the
more
bland
and
unexceptional
american
macros
or
import
adjuncts
it
can
be
a
bit
pricey
but
its
worth
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
refreshing
and
flavorful
light
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
big
white
head
this
beer
has
a
very
grainy
aroma
and
grainy
honeyish
taste
with
a
light
leafy
bitterness
to
list
all
the
characteristics
of
its
taste
doesnt
sufficiently
distinguish
it
from
other
lagers
of
its
style
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
tastes
better
than
almost
any
other
macrolager
out
there
and
doesnt
have
to
stay
ice
cold
to
be
enjoyable
i
do
not
like
this
beer
i
would
not
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
really
like
this
lager
it
has
a
really
light
yellow
color
and
lightly
carbonated
the
smell
took
me
by
suprise
it
smells
of
corn
with
a
nice
hint
of
hops
its
taste
is
good
leaving
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
kinda
holds
on
the
top
of
mouth
drinkability
is
nice
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
clean
i
think
its
uniquie
for
the
fact
that
its
not
available
everywhere
and
i
enjoy
it
everytime
i
have
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
about
it
cheers
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
drinkability
is
defining
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
now
ive
always
been
one
to
prefer
cans
and
i
think
this
may
be
a
good
example
of
what
the
oskar
blues
brewing
company
has
been
trying
to
tell
everyone
the
can
seemed
to
do
a
lot
to
preserve
the
freshness
of
this
beer
planning
to
visit
jamaica
in
march
hope
to
see
if
the
taste
varies
there
and
cant
wait
to
try
dragon
stout
d
not
as
bad
as
i
had
thought
this
being
the
second
time
a
friend
has
given
it
to
me
i
actually
enjoyed
it
much
better
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
would
i
pick
it
up
voluntarily
though
probably
not
i
dont
like
to
give
bad
reviews
but
this
is
a
beer
that
i
cannot
recommend
to
anyone
d
its
quite
good
nice
feeling
all
the
way
it
has
a
great
taste
and
my
over
all
opinion
is
that
this
beer
dose
its
job
very
good
and
can
be
warmly
recommend
for
the
right
actuation
might
be
one
of
my
standtos
for
the
summer
not
a
bad
little
brew
for
what
it
is
look
bright
yellow
urinetype
color
the
foamy
head
has
2
fingers
but
disappears
very
quickly
the
bottle
is
worse
seems
like
medical
packaging
smell
sweet
and
smooth
malt
and
grains
only
taste
acceptable
sweet
malt
and
lot
of
carbonation
no
hops
to
talk
about
mouthfeel
refreshing
denotes
slightest
bitterness
with
a
sweet
finish
very
carbonated
but
dont
being
offensive
drinkability
mediocre
12
oz
bottle
from
a
world
of
beer
gift
pack
so
who
knows
how
old
this
is
no
freshness
date
poured
to
glass
light
golden
yellow
practically
no
head
faded
to
almost
nothing
smell
was
a
bit
like
bmc
but
also
had
something
like
pee
or
ammonia
not
really
funk
or
skunk
hard
to
pin
it
taste
was
somewhat
sweet
but
again
hard
to
pin
what
the
grain
was
not
really
malt
or
wheat
or
even
rice
carbonation
was
very
prickly
and
gassy
not
something
i
really
liked
i
hate
to
be
too
hard
on
this
since
its
probably
past
its
prime
but
this
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
id
be
willing
to
try
again
if
im
ever
in
jamaica
uncomplicated
and
maybe
thats
just
the
point
obviously
not
a
first
option
but
in
situations
where
choices
are
limited
you
could
do
much
worse
brewed
in
canada
by
moosehead
review
number
666
cool
eh
notes
is
this
metallic
hint
normal
it
fades
as
it
warms
it
really
isnt
ever
too
unpleasant
thought
just
noticeable
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
is
still
just
about
average
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
some
reason
it
reminds
me
of
corona
extra
but
better
this
at
least
has
flavor
color
and
head
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
at
a
store
it
makes
for
a
good
addition
this
beer
is
also
great
for
back
yard
grilling
and
with
jerk
chicken
d
light
beer
which
is
very
plain
makes
it
a
very
good
session
beer
and
abv
is
low
well
im
not
on
a
jamaican
beach
so
red
stripe
gets
rated
accordingly
it
is
not
one
of
the
lost
gems
of
brewing
it
is
a
very
average
lager
which
means
not
a
lot
is
going
on
here
d
a
decent
lager
i
would
choose
before
other
similar
styles
d
theres
not
a
lot
of
flavor
or
aroma
to
this
beer
but
its
extremely
drinkable
and
has
its
place
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summertime
beers
partly
because
it
reminds
me
of
a
great
business
trip
to
kingston
its
great
on
a
hot
day
i
see
that
a
lot
of
people
are
critical
of
this
beer
but
for
what
it
is
its
a
good
beer
really
was
more
bitter
than
i
remember
maybe
my
palate
has
changed
over
the
years
from
craft
brew
but
this
used
to
be
a
treat
from
regular
rolling
rock
and
now
its
only
slightly
above
average
an
ok
beer
not
a
bad
beer
for
drinking
at
the
ball
game
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
drinkability
not
bad
this
is
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
and
this
would
be
perfect
with
a
burger
or
hot
dog
or
something
libation
what
can
i
say
its
neither
complex
nor
interesting
and
to
be
any
good
is
must
be
drunk
very
very
cold
i
know
this
is
an
adjunct
lager
and
people
tend
to
lower
standards
in
this
category
but
there
are
good
adjuncts
out
there
and
this
just
isnt
one
of
them
pours
out
with
a
huge
amount
of
foam
even
with
a
conservative
pour
dissipates
after
awhile
leaving
behind
no
lacing
for
the
smell
it
smells
as
youd
expect
from
an
adjunct
lager
which
is
very
similar
to
budweiser
for
the
taste
it
basically
tastes
bland
save
for
being
slightly
sweet
since
drinkability
is
this
styles
claim
to
fame
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
basically
its
no
surprises
except
for
the
sweetness
if
i
am
in
need
of
an
adjunct
lager
in
the
future
its
a
good
chance
itll
be
this
final
thoughts
after
having
banks
i
was
hoping
that
red
stripe
would
not
follow
the
same
tread
as
that
god
awful
caribbean
beer
however
this
beer
surprised
me
and
apart
from
the
smell
is
a
good
beer
especially
for
an
adjunct
really
the
only
thing
else
that
needs
to
be
said
is
hooray
beer
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
produces
a
10
mm
thin
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
appearance
is
wheatstraw
yellow
and
clear
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
little
bitterness
i
get
no
hint
of
any
adjunct
the
feel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
great
session
pick
if
youre
down
in
the
islands
mon
drinkability
high
marks
for
drinkability
depending
on
your
taste
some
may
not
be
able
to
handle
the
upfront
sweetness
and
lingering
bitter
finish
for
me
the
journey
is
pleasant
from
start
to
finish
d
i
look
forward
to
a
chance
of
drinking
red
stripe
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
that
makes
me
happy
when
i
tihnk
of
their
brilliant
advertising
hooray
beer
better
than
average
for
a
macro
lager
love
the
short
stout
round
bottle
goes
down
easy
with
a
crips
mouthfeel
and
semisweet
slightly
malty
smell
taste
is
good
compared
to
other
bigbrews
of
the
same
style
this
one
is
a
nice
thing
to
have
on
the
beach
in
jamaica
goes
good
with
spicey
caribean
food
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
on
occasion
its
a
nice
beer
to
sample
holy
moley
im
back
in
jamaica
on
my
honeymoon
this
was
the
goto
beer
at
the
resort
for
lack
of
any
other
brands
must
have
been
a
deal
with
the
club
anyway
light
straw
appearance
was
surprised
with
the
nice
foamy
head
that
lasted
a
few
sips
smell
was
macro
lager
slightly
sweet
the
taste
was
typical
but
not
as
bad
as
some
mouthfeel
was
spritzy
and
drinkability
was
easy
drinkability
better
than
your
average
macro
but
nothing
exciting
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
day
in
jamaica
its
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
but
a
little
light
on
flavor
overall
this
is
a
decent
american
style
lager
with
more
character
to
it
than
a
bmc
brew
its
a
good
session
beer
and
will
satisfy
a
crowd
well
enough
worth
trying
at
least
and
something
i
occasionally
go
for
in
the
right
situation
not
bad
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
much
better
alternative
to
bmc
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
it
has
good
flavor
for
an
american
lager
ive
decided
that
i
kinda
like
this
beer
its
still
a
cheap
grocery
store
lager
but
ill
take
it
over
bmc
anyday
kinda
comparable
to
yuengling
in
my
opinion
these
things
are
very
drinkable
the
body
is
what
is
expected
from
a
thin
blonde
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
having
multiples
would
be
very
easy
but
if
you
had
other
options
why
would
you
all
in
all
not
a
bad
macro
taste
is
fairly
watery
and
plain
extremely
thin
in
the
mouth
its
drinkable
but
not
at
all
enjoyable
or
apetising
i
had
trouble
finishing
mine
because
it
was
just
so
uninsprising
light
hint
of
hops
its
not
a
bad
taste
but
its
not
a
good
or
interesting
one
either
but
i
guess
thats
to
be
expected
of
this
style
all
in
all
not
bad
a
step
above
bmc
for
sure
and
very
sessionable
nothing
great
but
not
one
i
would
outright
turn
away
this
is
a
decent
beer
very
drinkable
actually
quite
good
fot
the
style
but
at
8
to
9
bucks
a
sixer
ill
pass
there
a
a
lot
better
beer
at
a
lot
better
price
point
such
as
michlob
pbr
and
my
personal
favorite
high
life
drinkability
an
easy
beer
to
drink
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
a
few
at
a
time
but
for
the
price
id
prefer
a
six
of
killians
or
coors
not
much
here
when
you
get
right
down
to
it
decent
pale
golden
appearance
with
a
moderate
head
that
quickly
dissipates
very
little
smell
of
any
kind
taste
fainly
of
hops
with
moderate
carbonation
a
disappointingly
watery
mouthfeel
i
suppose
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
the
mood
struck
you
but
whats
the
point
overall
an
above
average
adjunct
lager
drinkability
i
bought
this
because
i
liked
the
bigger
bottles
ive
tried
before
but
no
where
on
the
can
does
it
say
jamaican
lager
just
imported
lager
to
me
this
is
a
less
impressive
version
of
the
bottled
brew
and
much
less
drinkable
ill
have
to
check
the
bottles
again
to
see
if
the
info
is
the
same
d
goes
down
easy
i
might
buy
this
agian
if
vistiting
jamaca
and
worrying
about
thier
water
quality
lol
other
than
that
i
might
just
feel
more
comfortable
picking
up
an
everyday
american
canadian
macro
such
as
blue
or
bud
pretty
lame
overall
very
underwhelming
appearance
super
pale
with
almost
no
sign
of
any
head
aroma
is
a
bit
offputting
and
the
taste
unsurprisingly
is
equally
disappointing
theres
a
faint
sweetness
in
the
flavor
but
not
in
a
pleasant
way
almost
like
a
sticky
sugar
quality
overall
its
sour
and
musty
and
just
bad
dr
tolerable
but
there
are
soooo
many
better
beers
out
there
if
served
freezing
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
im
sure
this
would
be
really
slamable
yet
im
not
going
to
give
it
points
for
being
a
beer
you
can
chug
this
just
doesnt
taste
good
and
its
price
42
a
case
is
obscene
compared
to
the
bevy
of
better
brewed
beer
available
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
if
nothing
higher
end
were
available
this
is
one
beer
that
might
be
more
alluring
on
the
tongue
if
drank
from
the
bottle
i
remember
it
hitting
closer
to
the
target
vegetal
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
opening
into
a
slight
echo
of
sweetness
flushing
quickly
into
a
sharp
crisp
noble
hop
finish
bite
and
all
that
seems
to
be
the
highlight
of
most
adjunct
lagers
and
it
certainly
is
the
star
here
crisp
refreshing
light
and
effervescent
i
really
like
this
finish
i
realize
that
i
am
sipping
on
a
good
example
of
a
drinkable
crisp
and
well
lubed
adjunct
lager
drinkability
a
six
pack
of
red
stripe
will
go
down
really
quick
i
drank
5
durring
my
fantasy
football
draft
and
saved
one
for
this
good
but
when
your
drinking
it
you
know
its
8
bucks
a
six
pack
and
for
me
if
im
drinking
this
style
of
brew
i
would
much
rather
have
a
budweiser
perfect
refreshment
designed
to
be
drunk
several
to
the
sitting
in
hot
weather
a
hot
club
setting
or
with
spicy
caribbean
cuisine
d
this
has
a
bit
more
character
than
many
macro
lagers
and
it
fits
together
pretty
well
altogether
pretty
nice
on
such
a
sweltering
summer
night
simple
and
completely
inoffensive
drinkability
when
it
comes
to
adjunct
lagers
i
quite
like
red
stripe
and
under
the
right
circumstances
find
it
quite
drinkable
light
bodied
with
lots
of
prickly
carbonation
this
here
is
another
example
of
an
adjunct
lager
that
i
think
is
probably
a
notch
above
the
typical
bmc
lagers
out
there
a
cold
one
of
these
would
at
least
make
for
a
good
lawn
mower
beer
as
soon
as
the
weather
turns
colder
ill
be
back
to
sierra
nevada
and
bass
ale
but
in
the
meantime
hey
mon
ill
kick
back
with
this
jamaican
lager
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
which
disappears
almost
immediately
to
nothing
and
leaves
traces
of
lacing
the
smell
is
faint
smells
of
a
slight
grains
the
taste
is
of
sweet
grains
but
has
a
slight
skunk
bite
at
the
end
no
hops
to
speak
of
present
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
maybe
a
lil
watery
and
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
okay
nothing
to
object
to
but
very
simple
without
much
character
overall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
one
of
the
better
pure
clear
pale
yellow
macros
out
there
to
be
honest
on
par
with
your
pbrs
and
rainiers
good
for
what
it
is
very
glad
to
see
it
in
16oz
cans
though
very
cool
a
lawnmower
brew
period
red
stripe
is
a
beer
that
is
best
drank
within
its
environment
just
like
balashi
from
aruba
is
reminds
me
of
a
less
skunky
heineken
the
pickin
is
slim
in
jamaica
so
this
is
my
top
beer
choice
the
taste
was
very
light
very
refreshing
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bite
there
is
a
slight
sharpness
to
the
beer
underneath
the
bite
is
some
very
earthy
and
grainy
malts
some
definite
veggie
flavors
some
lagery
sulfer
tastes
as
well
this
beer
isnt
much
but
what
the
hell
it
was
refeshing
and
you
can
drink
more
than
one
went
to
a
party
with
a
buddy
of
mine
and
wanted
to
try
something
new
he
suggested
red
stripe
so
we
gave
it
a
try
i
was
suspicious
of
jamaican
beer
as
well
i
only
know
of
one
there
is
a
reason
the
jamaicans
are
not
known
for
their
beer
i
was
not
overly
impressed
with
red
stripe
as
it
was
average
or
a
little
below
average
across
the
board
for
me
it
is
drinkable
and
i
would
give
it
another
shot
but
not
any
time
soon
i
believe
a
slightlyabovemediocre
level
of
respect
is
due
to
red
stripe
any
time
i
have
had
it
it
was
the
or
one
of
the
only
options
available
other
than
bud
light
and
such
tasting
it
side
by
side
even
with
some
of
the
macro
fauxcrafts
such
as
michelob
amber
bock
have
displayed
that
red
stripe
in
fact
is
vastly
tastier
and
more
enjoyable
than
that
garbage
compared
to
michelob
amber
particularly
is
interesting
because
it
brings
out
maibocklike
characteristics
in
the
red
stripe
a
noticeable
caramel
malt
presence
blindly
tested
i
would
guess
red
stripe
was
the
bock
essentially
in
a
world
where
we
didnt
have
the
beer
market
flooded
with
garbage
this
sort
of
beer
should
be
whats
considered
your
average
c
however
thats
not
the
case
and
so
red
stripe
is
slightly
promoted
by
way
of
the
lousiness
of
the
other
popular
beers
terrible
beer
get
yourself
a
cheap
domestic
lager
instead
itll
cost
less
and
taste
better
d
i
like
this
beer
its
not
the
best
its
not
the
worst
but
still
a
unique
taste
d
well
i
hope
my
objectivety
wasnt
to
coloured
by
the
fact
that
im
no
friend
of
adjunct
lagers
but
this
is
a
beer
that
doesnt
have
strong
smells
or
tastes
if
your
into
this
kind
of
beer
i
think
you
will
like
the
head
and
the
fact
that
youll
get
really
refreshed
by
this
beer
not
bad
it
does
offer
something
a
lil
different
from
the
others
but
its
still
what
it
is
d
good
light
beer
that
you
can
drink
at
a
bbq
or
while
playing
poker
i
had
this
on
tap
while
staying
at
a
resort
in
jamaica
it
is
a
light
yellow
color
and
has
a
minimal
head
that
quickly
dissolves
it
has
that
classic
adjunct
lager
taste
mostly
malty
with
some
corn
and
it
was
slightly
sweet
it
smells
like
it
tastes
it
is
very
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
was
fine
for
drinking
while
lounging
in
or
around
the
pool
in
jamaica
but
not
something
i
would
ever
purchase
here
in
the
states
i
prefer
it
actually
in
the
bottle
over
being
on
tap
this
brew
will
not
win
any
prizes
for
its
looks
or
smell
but
is
damn
drinkable
very
crisp
very
refreshing
a
very
sweet
lager
which
is
a
bit
different
but
it
is
perfect
for
a
summer
day
this
beer
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
light
golden
color
and
a
very
thin
head
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
typical
of
a
lager
as
well
as
the
aroma
has
that
malty
lager
yeast
sweetness
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
they
are
good
with
advertising
i
can
see
myself
drinking
it
a
the
beach
small
white
head
not
a
bad
size
for
a
pale
lager
that
fades
quickly
with
fair
lacing
color
is
light
yellow
with
a
very
clear
body
and
no
particles
aroma
is
what
you
would
expect
with
maybe
some
fruit
present
thin
texture
and
a
light
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
very
shortlasting
finish
and
flavor
crisp
and
refreshing
one
of
the
better
beers
of
its
class
and
great
for
summer
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
gold
color
with
about
a
12
inchhead
does
not
have
a
strong
aroma
has
a
pretty
good
flavor
not
to
strong
and
a
tad
dry
feels
light
in
the
mouth
good
beer
for
drinking
on
a
hot
day
otherwise
its
pretty
average
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
above
average
this
is
certainly
something
id
go
back
toespecially
in
the
summer
or
for
a
good
lawnmower
beer
funny
thing
is
i
always
liked
this
beer
until
i
paid
close
attention
to
it
guess
the
moral
of
the
story
is
to
drink
more
and
think
less
thats
the
ticket
not
particularly
offensive
overall
but
not
good
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
either
ok
maybe
one
as
an
adequate
patio
thirst
quencher
in
hot
humid
weather
as
that
memory
remains
bonus
points
somewhat
for
continuing
to
employ
the
stubby
a
woefully
underrepresented
and
forgotten
packaging
style
around
these
parts
rr
no
seriously
its
drinkable
drinkability
very
high
drinkability
if
your
a
fan
of
the
beer
not
too
heavy
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
is
light
the
carbonation
is
lazy
perhaps
its
stoned
on
on
real
rhythm
and
pulse
of
jamaica
you
know
what
i
am
talking
about
the
ganja
pot
honesty
the
body
and
the
mouthfeel
are
limp
this
beer
needs
some
viagra
for
me
this
beer
is
only
ok
if
you
dont
have
anything
else
to
drink
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
stiff
head
that
melts
slowly
and
leaves
some
lace
behind
smells
weakly
of
spent
grain
and
faint
citric
hops
this
beer
is
very
light
even
for
the
style
very
little
going
on
more
continental
tasting
than
american
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
and
slightly
creamy
with
a
dry
slightly
citrusy
finish
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
great
d
you
could
definitely
suck
a
few
these
down
not
bad
but
not
very
much
to
it
d
very
drinkable
pretty
tasty
drinkability
inoffensive
taste
okay
mouthfeel
ill
give
it
good
ratings
for
that
on
here
otherwise
meh
not
really
excellent
its
an
adjunct
after
all
amazingly
drinkable
going
down
almost
like
water
only
more
pleasantly
smooth
balanced
and
thirstquenching
would
make
a
great
accompaniment
to
a
nearly
infinite
number
of
dishes
light
and
inoffensive
yet
much
more
characterful
than
its
american
counterparts
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
i
have
nothing
to
complain
about
this
was
this
first
time
ive
had
one
without
spitting
it
out
so
i
give
it
a
thumbs
up
it
was
actually
very
crisp
and
clean
and
possessed
no
offflavours
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
flat
i
have
to
wonder
if
something
went
wrong
with
this
bottling
dirnkability
is
ok
if
i
was
looking
for
a
cheap
summer
lager
overall
not
impressed
horray
beer
but
not
this
one
i
will
give
this
one
a
plus
on
drinkablity
it
contains
nothing
that
would
stop
a
party
beer
from
happening
its
from
jamaica
mon
very
drinkable
and
smooth
full
and
a
flavorful
lager
why
drink
bud
when
you
can
drink
this
d
a
nice
beer
to
drink
in
the
country
it
comes
from
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
here
in
the
states
unless
highly
intoxicated
fish
one
of
the
least
drinkable
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
due
to
the
various
off
tasting
flavors
md
the
feel
is
like
that
of
a
soda
highly
carbonated
light
and
sugary
the
drinkability
is
good
and
refreshing
like
what
it
brewed
for
honestly
if
you
ate
looking
for
an
alcoholic
soda
look
no
further
this
is
your
choice
d
easy
drinkin
even
out
of
the
cool
ass
bottle
even
cooler
if
you
have
a
red
stripe
beer
koozie
and
i
do
hooray
beer
d
good
for
what
its
worth
superior
to
most
lagers
taste
has
some
lemon
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
little
else
comes
across
for
me
very
light
little
body
could
down
one
of
these
in
a
nanosecond
on
a
hot
day
but
not
much
character
here
mfd
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
not
packed
with
flavor
but
goes
great
with
spicy
food
and
bbq
great
session
beer
even
better
in
the
heat
one
of
the
worse
beers
ive
had
i
have
no
problem
with
a
macor
here
and
there
but
this
was
rough
piss
yellow
color
with
thin
white
head
with
no
retention
whatsoever
smell
was
a
dry
malty
mess
taste
about
the
same
a
sweeter
dry
malt
some
grain
mouthfeel
was
light
and
thin
though
not
as
light
as
many
other
macros
overall
just
not
a
beer
for
me
id
take
a
pacifico
or
even
a
bud
light
over
this
any
day
drinkability
not
an
entirely
bad
beer
and
a
better
macro
than
most
by
no
means
is
this
beer
good
it
just
isnt
bad
either
lack
of
hops
makes
it
a
less
then
optimal
beer
pong
match
sweetness
is
somewhat
overwhelming
servem
cold
and
in
the
bottle
as
a
glass
doesnt
do
any
justice
to
this
pizza
partner
pours
a
light
brown
color
not
much
head
a
bit
fizzy
nose
is
kinda
skunky
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
possibly
ginger
taste
is
also
slightly
spicy
not
much
skunk
thankfully
and
also
a
little
sweet
rather
light
on
the
palate
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
summer
and
id
have
it
again
on
a
hot
day
when
it
was
cold
but
not
a
very
memorable
beer
the
taste
is
light
but
pleasant
grain
with
a
little
lemon
and
apple
peel
its
light
mostly
lightly
sweet
with
with
a
very
light
crisp
bitter
hint
d
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
keep
drinking
far
beyond
the
point
that
you
should
stop
just
interesting
enough
to
keep
you
drinking
it
and
not
at
all
interesting
enough
to
make
you
stop
and
think
about
it
d
ill
still
place
this
is
in
with
all
the
other
macros
but
give
it
a
bit
more
credit
it
is
slightly
better
and
definitely
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
d
very
drinkable
if
youre
in
the
summer
guzzling
thirstquenching
mood
this
beer
is
something
that
i
do
not
have
very
often
but
is
good
in
the
summer
i
usually
stay
away
from
any
big
beers
during
the
summer
months
and
a
red
strip
while
in
frount
of
the
grille
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
take
me
to
jamaica
d
3
5
more
hints
of
malt
than
i
expected
i
dig
the
subtle
balance
its
not
a
standout
and
i
like
this
as
i
used
to
always
drink
it
in
college
its
brings
back
good
vibes
dig
the
red
stripe
a
beer
ive
heard
much
talk
about
red
stripe
pours
golden
yellow
with
about
a
finger
width
head
the
beer
smells
very
much
like
corn
and
malt
smell
is
nothing
special
here
on
first
sip
the
beer
is
very
good
tasting
the
thing
that
i
find
most
apparent
in
the
taste
is
salt
it
just
seems
very
salty
i
noticed
after
having
a
couple
of
these
the
saltiness
makes
it
hard
to
continue
drinking
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
goes
down
like
water
overall
this
is
a
fairly
average
beer
not
something
i
would
buy
a
lot
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
definitely
recommended
cheers
d
its
an
ok
beer
goes
down
smooth
but
ive
had
other
beers
that
didnt
have
the
premium
price
and
tasted
better
d
easy
to
drink
and
worth
getting
again
although
i
wasnt
blown
away
an
ok
beer
overall
d
very
easy
to
drink
ill
invoke
the
island
here
and
say
that
this
beer
is
as
good
as
any
for
sitting
on
the
beach
a
warm
weather
beer
abv
is
manageable
flavors
integrate
well
drinkability
very
easy
only
good
for
long
hot
days
taste
starts
out
somewhat
sweet
bu
then
becomes
slightly
bitter
with
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
will
i
buy
this
again
yes
tastes
of
thin
malts
with
a
light
diacetyl
finish
feel
and
drink
are
better
that
many
of
the
style
yet
not
too
exciting
best
served
well
chilled
though
this
beer
is
still
palatable
well
above
the
recommended
serving
temperature
thus
enhancing
the
drinkability
somewhat
i
had
this
about
a
year
ago
out
of
the
bottle
it
is
much
better
when
poured
into
a
glass
but
that
might
be
because
the
only
beer
i
had
had
at
that
point
was
bud
out
of
the
bottle
it
might
have
a
semipermanent
home
in
my
fridge
for
those
times
when
my
pockets
are
running
low
very
drinkable
conclusion
for
a
style
that
does
not
lend
itself
to
greatness
or
even
mediocrity
it
may
be
argued
this
is
a
step
above
many
of
its
competitors
theres
a
decent
if
very
light
malt
presence
here
backed
with
hints
of
fruitiness
and
grainy
sweetness
its
nothing
special
but
its
good
for
the
style
and
would
be
great
for
washing
down
caribbean
or
mexican
grub
id
pick
this
over
a
corona
any
day
easy
drinking
lager
this
is
a
very
drinkable
adjunct
lager
and
if
the
price
is
right
it
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
reccommended
drinkability
though
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
or
have
a
need
for
it
its
not
a
bad
beer
easily
could
drink
this
throughout
sweltering
days
its
just
not
that
high
on
my
gotta
have
list
rated
may

2007
a
typical
mass
produced
import
here
but
i
find
it
much
more
drinkable
than
the
usual
one
has
a
sweeter
taste
to
it
and
the
adjuncts
really
come
out
but
it
does
make
it
much
more
flavorful
and
drinkable
because
of
the
lack
of
lacing
and
any
color
its
basically
off
white
it
loses
points
in
appearance
but
not
mad
overall
pours
a
clear
golden
color
14
inch
head
with
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
of
adjunct
in
lager
a
little
disappointing
because
i
was
expecting
more
fits
the
style
tastes
of
adjunct
in
lager
it
is
slightly
sweeter
than
other
adjunct
ive
had
overall
just
slightly
better
than
others
but
not
worth
trying
drinkability
sure
therere
better
lagers
but
there
are
also
far
far
worse
ones
to
be
found
the
metallic
aftertaste
definitely
mars
its
overall
drinkability
but
beyond
that
its
really
just
another
pale
lager
d
an
easy
beer
to
consume
pleasing
but
not
overwhelming
hooray
beer
fresh
spicy
nose
with
floral
accents
pours
a
clear
light
straw
yellow
the
tall
white
head
is
somewhere
between
frothy
and
creamy
the
head
is
mostly
lasting
with
good
lacing
the
flavor
has
a
spicy
alcoholic
quality
with
a
clean
finish
balanced
but
not
very
deep
the
light
body
is
creamy
and
lively
with
a
lightly
astringent
finish
better
than
countless
other
american
standards
ok
so
appearance
is
fizzy
straw
yellow
with
a
tiny
head
and
no
notable
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
average
some
corn
smell
that
is
absent
in
the
taste
a
relatively
clean
taste
no
notable
hops
mouthfeel
is
weak
even
for
this
style
drinkability
is
pretty
refreshing
but
that
is
largely
due
to
a
light
flavor
straw
like
color
with
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
the
nose
is
cooked
corn
floral
hops
and
malt
the
taste
is
corn
cereal
and
yeasty
a
very
thin
body
typical
to
the
style
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
it
is
a
okay
beer
for
its
style
better
than
bud
i
too
am
one
of
those
bastards
that
have
tasted
red
stripe
from
the
tap
in
jamaica
and
stand
before
you
to
proclaim
that
it
does
taste
really
good
maybe
it
was
the
island
that
it
was
100
degrees
and
that
i
had
drank
about
a
million
rumbased
drinks
and
was
looking
for
a
change
i
will
still
turn
to
my
fatbottle
friend
from
time
to
time
but
its
just
not
the
same
it
is
what
it
is
pours
a
body
that
is
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
big
fairly
quickly
diminishing
head
some
malts
and
wheat
in
the
aroma
has
a
slightly
malty
taste
with
no
aftertaste
not
a
very
complex
flavor
theyve
started
selling
this
one
all
across
music
venues
in
london
ouch
its
pretty
bad
in
many
ways
horrible
metallic
after
taste
meaty
taste
during
the
pint
quite
a
thick
lager
as
lagers
go
tastes
a
bit
like
an
off
stella
bad
bad
bad
better
alternatives
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
really
comes
through
to
me
its
quite
easy
to
drink
and
putting
away
a
6er
of
this
stuff
isnt
going
to
have
you
completely
gone
um
have
to
admit
im
not
anticpating
reviewing
this
but
nevermind
every
dog
has
its
day
it
pours
pale
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
and
looks
more
interesting
in
the
glass
than
in
the
commercial
it
smells
i
should
leave
it
at
that
it
smells
like
vacuum
cleaner
dust
the
taste
is
tinny
cardboard
with
lemons
herbs
a
slight
pepper
finish
and
a
lot
of
bland
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
with
more
body
than
youd
expect
or
than
i
would
its
drinkable
only
if
its
very
very
hot
this
is
a
mild
but
ugly
beer
overall
please
spend
your
money
on
something
of
the
craft
genre
i
put
this
in
a
byo
6
pk
so
it
wasnt
too
expensive
but
i
would
never
buy
this
again
i
guess
all
in
all
it
was
worth
a
the
try
because
i
think
every
beer
deserves
a
chance
but
i
will
still
stay
away
from
it
take
budweiser
down
to
jamaica
and
package
it
in
a
grenade
shaped
bottle
and
there
you
go
its
red
stripe
the
funky
bottle
is
the
only
good
aspect
of
this
swill
qualities
are
just
like
our
typical
american
pale
lagers
if
you
enjoy
this
one
save
yourself
some
cash
and
buy
domestic
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
little
head
and
no
lace
smells
like
malt
and
not
a
lot
else
tastes
about
the
same
very
simple
beer
feels
good
well
carbonated
but
not
overly
so
and
very
very
drinkable
still
a
damn
good
beer
d
undoubtably
drinkable
high
level
of
carbonation
made
it
more
filling
than
it
really
should
be
all
in
all
really
not
one
for
the
taking
d
a
decent
session
beer
not
necessarily
worth
the
premium
price
i
liked
the
bottle
it
was
different
better
than
macrobrewed
american
lagers
but
really
more
hype
than
substance
poured
golden
yellow
and
thats
how
it
tasted
this
whole
beer
is
offensive
to
good
beer
flavor
and
aroma
are
typical
of
an
american
macro
lager
but
a
little
better
not
a
fan
mouthfeel
was
thin
to
medium
smooth
solid
amer
lager
prost
d
overall
this
is
pretty
good
and
if
this
was
my
main
option
in
the
caribbean
id
be
fine
with
that
if
guinness
foreign
extra
werent
available
of
course
i
can
see
why
it
was
bond
creator
ian
flemings
beer
of
choice
bond
even
partakes
of
a
red
stripe
in
the
old
novels
this
isnt
worth
a
whole
sixer
but
it
would
make
a
decent
addition
to
a
mixed
session
sixer
dont
really
understand
how
it
symbolizes
jamaica
but
it
is
a
damn
good
beer
maybe
if
i
try
smoking
some
sinsemilla
with
it
i
would
understand
there
were
two
beers
id
wanted
to
try
for
a
while
red
stripe
and
smithwicks
my
wife
brought
me
one
of
each
so
i
could
try
them
while
watching
mccain
vs
obama
ii
while
i
will
be
buying
smithwicks
with
some
regularity
now
i
probably
wont
be
buying
red
stripe
except
when
i
want
the
bottles
as
a
conversation
piece
sorry
to
shit
all
over
this
beer
but
i
paid
12
for
6
and
could
only
drink
2
i
noticed
a
lot
of
people
saying
that
this
beer
is
skunky
very
true
this
beer
has
a
certain
skunked
quality
too
it
the
biggest
struggle
i
had
was
getting
it
in
my
head
that
the
skunky
taste
was
the
taste
was
that
they
were
going
for
im
not
saying
that
they
intentionally
brewed
a
skunked
beer
its
just
a
part
of
the
experience
with
this
beer
an
acquired
taste
though
for
sure
i
little
citrusy
too
smells
delicious
as
well
d
i
got
this
beer
because
i
hadnt
had
it
since
college
and
couldnt
remember
what
it
tasted
like
it
shouldve
stayed
that
way
this
is
a
totally
uninteresting
piece
of
brewing
not
bad
for
beer
flavored
water
though
poured
from
a
pint
bottle
this
brew
appears
a
golden
color
with
a
fleeting
craggy
head
no
lacing
smell
is
malts
and
wet
corn
sweet
grass
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
some
grainy
bitterness
more
flavorful
than
almost
any
american
macro
youll
find
mouthfeel
is
a
refreshing
and
the
beer
overall
is
a
highly
drinkable
macro
a
pale
gold
thin
layer
of
rice
crispy

d
as
red
stripe
was
originally
from
my
hometown
of
galena
illinois
many
many
years
ago
i
had
to
review
this
beer
sadly
it
was
a
big
disappointment
lacked
much
in
terms
of
good
qualities
and
the
thin
mouthfeel
really
stood
out
not
one
ill
be
going
back
to
2
50
light
carbonated
mouthfeel
good
beer
for
spicy
grilled
food
better
hot
weather
beer
for
sure
not
too
bad
for
a
macro
style
with
a
bit
of
a
twist
i
recently
spent
a
week
at
an
all
inclusive
resort
in
jamaica
and
i
drank
beaucoup
amounts
of
red
stripe
im
not
normally
a
big
fan
of
lagers
but
red
stripe
is
definitely
my
favorite
caribbean
brewed
beer
it
goes
well
with
anything
it
pours
a
little
more
golden
brown
than
your
typical
american
lager
and
it
offers
a
little
more
in
body
and
taste
i
could
and
did
drink
this
stuff
all
day
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
sidenote
any
beer
featured
in
the
greatest
james
bond
film
dr
no
of
alltime
gets
bonus
points
this
beer
poured
yellow
with
a
little
carbonation
action
and
twofinger
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
smell
is
pretty
typical
of
a
macro
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
some
corn
adjunct
the
taste
starts
with
some
sweetness
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
in
the
middle
with
a
pretty
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
a
bad
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
plain
lager
or
a
beer
that
pairs
well
with
spicy
food
i
occasionally
get
these
at
the
bar
when
they
dont
having
any
better
offerings
so
i
have
never
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
but
the
color
is
a
typical
golden
macro
color
smells
of
faint
malts
and
hops
the
taste
has
a
medium
body
and
is
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
nothing
spectacular
but
they
go
down
easy
and
i
have
no
complaints
with
this
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
texture
in
the
mouth
happens
to
be
great
having
the
zip
and
briskness
in
carbonation
without
the
sharpness
on
the
tongue
thats
about
it
though
i
feel
ripped
off
spending
7
49
the
same
as
a
good
sam
adams
sixer
for
this
pedestrian
import
ill
suggest
drinking
this
ice
cold
straight
from
the
bottle
as
there
is
nothing
here
that
rewards
any
effort
at
all
beer
its
not
just
a
beverage
beer
is
food
d
the
beer
was
meant
for
pounding
light
and
low
in
alcohol
poured
to
a
3
inch
head
that
settled
pretty
fast
although
it
did
leave
some
lacing
with
every
swallow
beer
was
light
yellow
in
colour
and
head
was
snow
white
smelled
slightly
sweet
and
of
corn
pretty
light
smelling
tasted
a
little
sweet
and
had
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
felt
good
in
the
mouth
and
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
about
right
i
actually
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
ill
buy
again
i
think
it
would
make
a
good

with
a
lingering

pretty
damn
good
for

a
little
sweet
for
a
lager
but
still
recommended
this
is
probably
my
favorite
tasting
macro
available
the
price
is
somewhat
expensive
for
a
macro
but
it
is
worth
it
after
you
consider
the
alternatives
great
session
beer
for
college
students
like
myself
and
even
better
for
the
beach
parties
or
what
have
you
d
very
drinkable
no
undesirable
flavors
i
kinda
like
this
but
its
not
going
to
get
an
amazing
score
because
this
is
not
the
top
end
of
the
style
sorry
jamaica
first
jamaican
beer
ive
had
and
the
only
one
i
know
of
the
first
time
i
had
it
a
friend
of
mine
had
it
sitting
in
his
room
for
some
time
so
it
was
kind
of
skunked
but
i
ordered
it
one
night
at
the
bar
and
i
was
glad
i
bought
it
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
or
slam
a
sixer
one
night
d
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
i
just
had
this
with
my
neighbor
and
i
finished
as
much
as
possible
just
to
be
polite
not
bad
good
for
a
change
sometimes
tried
this
stuff
for
the
first
time
when
i
actually
visited
jamaica
in
2005
so
i
like
to
think
i
had
it
pretty
fresh
it
was
on
tap
at
jimmy
buffets
bar
in
ocho
rios
any
beer
could
have
been
good
on
that
hot
day
but
this
really
hit
the
spot
seemed
almost
like
any
american
light
beer
my
buddy
and
i
winded
up
buying
two
cases
of
this
to
bring
back
with
us
on
our
cruise
ship
as
the
week
went
on
we
got
pretty
tired
of
it
as
it
wasnt
any
thing
special
in
our
minds
so
for
the
price
of
9
for
a
six
pack
in
the
states
something
like
20
usd
for
a
case
there
ill
wait
till
i
go
back
to
jamaica
to
get
more
personally
i
recommend
this
beer
at
least
being
tried
once
as
it
is
a
good
summer
treat
really
try
and
get
it
if
you
stop
in
jamaica
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
color
with
a
decent
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
pretty
malty
and
sugary
for
a
lager
taste
is
much
sweeter
than
is
typical
for
a
brew
of
this
type
very
malty
when
compared
to
its
competitors
moderate
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
brew
especially
in
the
summer
time
feel
is
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
definately
has
more
body
than
a
milwaukee
beast
carbonation
keeps
it
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
not
again
soon
d
i
am
not
looking
for
any
more
of
these
i
remember
having
this
beer
a
few
years
back
and
a
couple
gave
me
a
slight
stomach
ache
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
as
it
has
a
high
drinkability
rating
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
notes
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
lager
that
go
down
easy
on
a
hot
day
i
like
to
pair
this
with
a
fresh
cut
lawn
and
a
hammock
in
the
shade
if
i
wanted
to
drink
water
i
would
have
bought
water
d
definitely
drinkable
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
grainy
almost
biscuity
taste
with
a
very
faint
hop
tinge
to
it
not
bad
but
nothing
special
a
golden
yellow
forms
a
crisp
white
head
that
vanishes
fast
to
a
thin
lacing
thin
malts
and
light
hops
filled
the
air
with
a
light
scent
a
thin
and
malty
taste
that
goes
down
light
and
crisp
with
a
small
amount
of
fizz
over
all
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
if
someone
passed
me
one
i
would
gladly
take
it
nothing
special
this
one
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
far
amount
of
head
that
quickley
windes
down
to
a
slight
ring
around
the
glass
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sour
at
first
but
then
the
hop
kiss
washes
the
sour
away
this
has
a
good
all
around
flavor
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
thiss
one
is
alwayst
one
i
will
come
back
to
this
is
a
favorite
session
beer
of
mine
especially
on
summer
nights
like
tonight
the
4th
of
july
in
sunny
sweltering
florida
there
are
many
lagers
that
are
better
slightly
sweet
but
dry
on
the
finish
and
an
average
hop
bitterness
that
kicks
any
american
macros
ass

the
first
beer
i
ever
bought
once
i
turned

in
the
united
states
of
america
have
had
a
few
times
since
but
in
the
end
it
pales
still
but
wouldnt
choose
it
over
craft
beer
that
said
very
easy
to
drink
its
very
drinkable
it
makes
few
statements
so
its
hard
to
argue
with

the
cost
is
similar

would

with
a

of

is
alright
too
but
who
expected
greatness
its
decent
but
at
the
same
time
it
reminds
me
why
i
lean
away
from
these
types
im
sure
theres
better
in
the
style
has
some
good
points
being
that
its
relative
cheap

complimented

of

at

for

for
the

its
not
bad
pours
just
as
youd
imagine
a
macro
lager
to
pour
pissy
golden
yellow
with
little
head
the
smell
is
horrible
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
worst
smelling
beers
ive
tried
just
horrible
haylike

the
taste
on
the

is
quite
good
for
the
style
i
would
definitly
put
it
above
miller

life
and
even
maybe
schlitz
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
this
is
the
first
time
ive
poured
it
into
a
glass
instead
of
drinking
out
of
the
stubby
bottle
i
can
say
that
the
taste
is
definitly
better
in

nothing
to
write

about

5an
interesting
beer
if
your
benchmark
is
a
typical
american
macro
lager
theres
a
nice
head
which
pours
golden
with
a
pretty
average
head
smells
is
your
basic
beer
smell
taste
is
grainy
and
sweet
with
a
touch
slightly
bitter
hops
with
a
tiny
bit
of
a
fruityfunky
yeasty
taste
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
as
well
drinkability
is
pretty
high
but
the
more
i
drank
the
more
funky
taste
i
picked
up
so
it
got
pretty
old
fast
ever
so
slightly
better
than
your
average
macro
swill
though
drinkability
i
usually
drink
these
ice
cold
straight
from
the
bottle
at
manic
sweaty
ska
concerts
theyre
very
refreshing
and
theyre
really
not
bad
in
a
glass
and
at
a
more
moderate
temperature
either
i
would
say
yank
one
out
of
the
six
pack
before
you
buy
a
six
supermarkets
allow
it
and
most
cashiers
screw
the
price
up
and
charge
you
just
around
1
00
oh
well
enjoy
overall
leaning
towards
bland
with
nothing
inspiring
about
it
but
not
as
bad
as
i
had
expected
i
will
keep
this
one
short
and
to
the
point
i
recently
revisted
this
beer
over
the
weekend
i
decided
to
do
so
because
i
wanted
a
cold
beer
and
something
aside
from
the
usual
high
abv
beers
i
typically
have
in
the
fridge
overall
the
taste
of
this
lager
is
much
better
than
any
american
macro
i
can
think
of
and
it
is
refreshing
enough
and
small
enough
to
enjoy
several
i
dont
typically
drink
a
6er
but
this
went
down
with
ease
while
cooking
and
watching
the
hockey
game
if
you
want
something
light
and
crisp
pick
it
up
and
give
it
a
go
taste
is
sweet
malt
lightly
bitter
sour
finish
with
metallic
flavors
mixed
in
all
this
is
quite
unpleasant
a
crisp
and
clean
finish
i
usually
drink
this
out
of
a
bottle
if
i
find
myself
in
fl
with
no
better
option
and
thats
the
way
it
should
remain
if
you
can
actually
smell
and
taste
it
in
the
glass
its
brutal
no
thanks
drinkability
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
was
definitely
surprised
by
this
one
id
heard
of
it
but
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
so
i
stayed
away
but
then
my
brother
brought
a
couple
by
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
i
was
impressed
but
since
i
pretty
much
hate
lagers
dont
read
too
much
into
that
by
the
taste
its
smoother
than
the
american
lagers
ive
come
to
know
and
hate
not
super
hoppy
its
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
burrito
or
tacos
im
not
gonna
buy
this
on
my
own
but
if
someone
shoves
another
one
in
my
hand
ill
drink
it
happily
enough
red
stripe
jamaican
lager
gives
a
golden
pour
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
12
ounce
brown
barrel
bottle
the
smell
isnt
unpleasant
a
little
grain
maybe
a
little
hop
you
know
this
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
that
hits
you
over
the
head
but
it
is
actually
quite
well
balanced
and
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
particularly
on
a
hot
day
definitely
an
improvent
over
budmillercoors
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
lager
overall
not
bad
usually
its
a
bit
pricey
but
nice
from
time
to
time
like
at
a
bbq
or
something
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
it
has
a
thin
consistency
a
little
watery
this
beer
was
a
nice
beer
to
have
in
the
atmosphere
i
was
in
it
was
hot
and
sunny
it
was
real
nice
to
have
by
the
pool
or
on
the
beach
id
have
it
again
on
a
hotter
day
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
taste
is
lacking
a
bit
farely
popular
beer
with
a
lot
of
jamaican
hype
this
beers
best
quality
was
its
carbonation
was
like
sprite
this
drink
has
a
nice
head
that
doesnt
skip
town
on
you
it
sticks
around
to
keep
you
warm
the
taste
is
better
than
bud
light
so
i
recommend
it
to
light
drinkers
not
interested
in
a
lot
of
taste
not
bad
to
drink
i
think
i
could
throw
back
about
50
of
these
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
quarterinch
of
head
that
is
maintained
for
a
little
while
by
a
moderate
cascade
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
is
big
in
corn
sweetness
lacking
hops
its
very
clean
but
very
bland
flavor
is
slightly
grainey
but
in
a
way
that
gives
the
impression
of
wet
paper
or
cardboard
i
dont
think
this
one
is
oxidized
as
this
one
really
seems
to
have
these
qualities
from
the
grainey
character
the
corn
sweetness
carries
through
lightly
this
one
is
fairly
flavorful
thoght
id
still
like
to
see
a
kiss
of
hop
feel
is
light
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
this
is
what
i
expected
clean
lines
inoffensive
but
nothing
that
stands
out
as
different
from
any
other
standard
macro
style
this
one
would
probably
taste
pretty
good
sitting
on
the
beach
in
jamaica
about
the
only
thing
good
i
can
say
about
this
is
that
it
is
a
step
up
from
corona
but
not
by
much
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
faint
hop
aroma
with
some
sweet
malt
and
corn
very
thin
and
watery
lawnmover
beer
all
the
way
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
is
typical
of
any
macro
lager
fizzy
and
light
bodied
it
isnt
much
more
than
tonic
water
to
the
palate
it
goes
down
easy
and
can
be
quite
refreshing
i
can
see
this
beer
going
well
with
pizza
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
be
on
the
fence
about
buying
why
should
i
buy
this
when
there
are
so
many
better
beers
on
the
market
i
guess
i
would
buy
this
again
if
and
only
if
i
wanted
to
drink
macrolagers
it
is
definitely
the
best
the
style
has
to
offer
d
pretty
good
as
far
as
macros
go
i
guess
but
nothing
id
look
for
extremely
drinkable
when
served
very
very
cold
and
out
of
the
bottle
hands
down
one
of
the
coolest
beer
bottles
red
stripe
is
a
classic
summertime
staple
when
the
weather
is
80
degrees
i
also
find
red
stripe
to
be
a
much
favored
option
over
most
american
macros
and
corona
d

deff
a
pizza
or
any
food
brew
can
drink
a
whole
bunch
in
a
session
will
go
with
this
when
i
dont
have
too
much
money
d

i
was
able
to
finish
most
of
this
but
dont
plan
on
this
being
an
option
in
my
fridge
ill
stick
to
my
ales
and
wheat
beers
great
summer
thirst
quencher
good
pizza
beer
an
unexceptional
beer
that
has
quaffing
qualities
and
probably
would
be
great
watching
the
cricket
in
jamaica
as
long
as
australia
was
winning
very
average
not
really
worth
trying
though
the
bottle
is
cool
not
for
me
fellas
ive
got
3
more
of
these
and
ive
never
put
a
beer
down
the
drain
and
this
wont
be
my
first
drinkable
but
not
worth
approaching
again
opinion
i
drank
this
beer
quite
a
few
times
and
it
definitely
has
more
mouthfeel
than
the
majority
of
the
macros
i
also
like
the
balance
of
the
hops
to
malt
versus
the
budmilloors
i
think
that
the
recipe
started
out
in
the
right
place
but
now
there
are
too
many
adjuncts
being
used
that
take
the
actual
flavor
away
and
leave
you
with
a
substandard
flavor
better
than
a
lot
but
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
an
interesting
and
decent
brew
but
still
too
light
for
my
tastes
fairly
full
of
flavor
for
a
macro
so
definitely
a
step
above
our
domestic
macro
product
fairly
crisp
dry
finish
only
a
hint
of
hops
another
beer
that
needs
to
be
downed
as
cold
as
possible
should
be
good
after
mowing
the
grass
or
with
spicy
food
hmm
this
is
like
corona
in
the
fact
that
people
assume
that
if
its
imported
it
must
be
good
but
its
not
its
a
little
darker
than
a
regular
macro
with
no
head
to
speak
of
but
a
small
ring
of
froth
that
goes
away
in
short
order
smell
is
a
tiny
bit
of
skunky
hops
all
i
can
detect
taste
is
very
lacking
again
the
watereddown
skunky
lager
flavor
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
i
guess
you
could
drink
these
if
there
was
nothing
else
around
barely
a
notch
above
an
american
macro
if
you
ask
me
which
isnt
saying
much
its
a
little
thin
and
a
bit
pale
however
i
think
the
taste
and
the
fact
that
it
goes
down
easy
more
than
make
up
for
that
red
stripe
has
an
almost
fruity
taste
and
sweetness
to
it
which
i
think
make
it
very
very
drinkable
i
love
the
stuff
and
highly
recommend
it
for
anyone
looking
for
something
a
little
different
that
wont
break
the
bank
bottle
poured
a
light
yellow
lager
with
a
nice
huge
bubbly
pure
white
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
crisp
hops
with
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
also
very
refreshing
with
crisp
hops
and
fresh
slightly
sweet
malt
not
skunky
as
i
had
feared
nor
that
thin
could
have
been
a
lot
worse
the
salesman
at
the
local
high
volume
beer
store
recommended
this
as
something
different
it
poured
with
a
small
head
which
dissipated
to
a
small
necklace
the
smell
was
mild
with
a
light
green
tea
colour
the
taste
was
well
skunky
reminiscent
of
the
beers
of
my
youth
that
i
would
hide
outside
for
a
couple
of
days
and
drink
warm
not
recommended
12
ounce
bottle
great
macro
id
venture
to
say
my
favourite
highly
recommended
overall
im
giving
this
a
3
for
drinkability
its
decent
enough
for
a
macro
lager
but
im
not
going
to
be
buying
these
regularly
maybe
make
a
nice
party
beer
this
was
almost
like
drinking
a
shandy
the
beer
flavor
was
mixed
with
what
i
felt
was
a
spiced
lemonade
flavor
not
sour
at
all
but
sweet
and
lemony
pretty
good
but
the
flavor
starts
to
mellow
after
the
first
few
tastes
and
you
realize
that
it
doesnt
hold
up
as
well
as
expected
becoming
more
watery
and
less
tasty
but
i
think
it
does
ok
and
is
good
for
one
in
a
night
but
no
more
this
taste
better
than
most
macros
but
it
still
can
drift
into
that
state
of
being
just
another
beer
for
warm
beach
climates
which
if
found
in
one
then
dont
hesitate
to
drink
this
its
very
pale
and
taste
is
smooth
and
almost
non
excistenet
but
not
as
bad
as
others
you
can
have
a
dozen
of
these
and
still
be
up
for
more
this
beer
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
color
atop
which
rested
a
foamy
white
head
there
was
plenty
of
carbonation
to
be
seen
the
smell
was
malty
but
also
had
a
slight
metallic
note
to
it
as
well
tasted
of
malt
corn
again
with
a
hint
of
metal
probably
the
closest
thing
to
equate
the
texture
and
taste
to
was
soapy
water
this
beer
wasnt
as
light
as
i
expected
but
it
was
thin
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
but
definitely
not
the
best
lager
out
there
even
by
macro
standards
i
love
the
commercials
though
a
drinkable
macro
better
than
a
lot
of
the
others
not
much
in
the
way
of
character
as
it
almost
totally
lacks
both
good
looks
pleasant
scent
or
delectable
flavor
but
hey
itd
be
good
cold
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
is
tops
the
crisp
yet
smooth
taste
leaves
mouths
wanting
more
yet
the
potency
lets
you
enjoy
beer
cmon
guys
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
down
to
the
bottle
its
smooth
yet
tasteful
enjoyable
yet
manly
this
beer
has
weekend
written
all
over
it
and
if
you
dont
agree
well
then
have
a
miller
high
life
on
one
hand
this
beer
is
probably
very
thirst
drenching
but
if
i
become
really
thirsty
i
drink
some
mineral
water
or
soft
drink
instead

the

i
poured
my

for

into
a
pilsner
glass
not
as
cool
as
it
stands
an
average
macro
lager
at
best
that
is
way
over
priced
there
are
countless
better
choices
for
the
money
still
every
now
and
then
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
have
i
would
love
to
try
this
in
jamaica
some
time
clear
yellow
color
and
a
thin
lace
for
a
head
the
smell
is
a
grassy
hop
and
faint
grain
a
touch
of
sulfer
too
the
taste
is
very
clean
leafy
hops
and
light
grains
light
to
medium

and
finishes
semidry
drinkability
is
great
though
the
best
beer
you
can
drink
with
a
spicy
meal
alround
easy
drinking
lager
a
very
drinkable
beer
on
hot
summer
days
when
you
dont
have
ac
like
me
better
than
bud
but
also
more
money
not
a
beer
for
the
connoisseur
but
your
nonbeerdrinking
friends
will
drink
it
probably
an
all
around
average
beer
its
typically
available
when
only
macros
are
sold
so
it
can
be
a
good
fall
back
beer
nothing
terribly
exceptional
about
it
but
nothing
terribly
bad
either
its
a
good
beer
for
new
drinkers
to
cut
their
teeth
on
as
it
is
a
cut
above
your
classic
macroswill
but
not
so
rich
that
it
will
scare
them
away
from
good
craft
beers
before
they
are
ready
i
did
not
expect
much
but
this
one
was
disappointing
for
sure
fine
bubbled
thick
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
golden
clear

vaguely
alcohol
smell
appley
champaign
nose
sweetish
flavor
very
smooth

sweet
aftertaste
bubbles
continue
to
precipitate
from
top
to
bottom
not
bad
at
all
i
like
it
and
not
too
expensive
either
the
aroma
is
lemony
buttery
the
taste
is
very
mild
with
no
extra
bite
but
is
buttery
and
nutty
not
much
there
but
slightly
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
red
stripe
lager
comes
in
the
old
school
stubby
brown
bottles
when
poured
the
red
stripe
has
a
light
golden
color
with
an
average
head
that
left
quickly
the
aroma
was
quite
interesting
initially
it
smelt
moldy
but
after
having
a
few
more
whiffs
i
could
pick
up
some
of
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
with
average
carbonation
and
the
aftertaste
was
crisp
and
rather
short
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
red
stripe
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
might
be
ok
to
give
it
at
try
corn
beer
basically
looks
like
an
ordinary
lager
yellow
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
low
level
sweetness
and
high
corn
sugar
to
nose
tastes
the
same
with
abrupt
yeastiness
and
low
maltiness
obviously
a
low
quality
beer
but
an
easy
drinking
one
light
body
slightly
creamy
and
slick
finishes
quick
and
airy
not
overly
complex
i
cannot
beleive
that
people
pay
3
dollars
per
bottle
it
would
make
a
nice
free
beer
appearance
is
translucent
light
golden
with
milky
foam
and
good
lacing
carbonation
is
medium
as
is
the
medium
aroma
has
your
barley
your
hops
and
your
sulphur
initial
taste
begins
with
the
creamy
mouthfeel
citrusleafy
hops
sweet
corn

has
barley

featured
prominently
in
john
grishams
the
firm

ive
heard
about
this
beer
for
years
seen
it
in
moveies
so
i
felt
i
finally
needed
to
try
it
poured
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
white
head
smell
is
sweet
with
touch
of
tropical
fruits
taste
has
a
slight
crispness
and
is
very
refreshing
left
a
nice
pleasant
aftertaste
easy
drinking
good
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
tasted
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
bottle
golden
hue
witha
thick
white
foam
fairly
heavy
on
the
carbonation
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
very
similar
to
most
other
american
macro
lager
mild
hoppiness
cant
seem
to
find
the
right
descriptions
for
taste
it
similar
to
the
standard
but
still
distint
perhaps
a
bit
richer
fairly
light
bodied
with
a
fleeting
aftertaste
possible
very
subtle
fruitiness
good
summer
beer
id
buy
it
again
for
the
right
occasion
might
be
a
great
crossover
beer
for
someone
taking
tiny
wee
baby
steps
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
short
lived
bubbly
head
good
clarity
with
almost
no
lacing
pale
malt
nose
with
hints
of
esters
and
champagne
the
malt
is
fruity
and
sweet
but
not
residual
and
the
hop
flavor
is
mild
but
balances
the
taste
well
the
light
body
and
crisp
carbonation
leave
a
clean
finish
excellent
choice
for
a
summer
session
brew
macros
with
a
pleasent
flavor
are
hard
to
find
this
one
manages
to
also
be
light
and
drinkable
i
see
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
positive
reviews
yet
i
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
liking
this
beer
the
appearence
and
smell
are
normal
nothing
great
nothing
bad
yet
i
find
this
beers
flavor
which
is
distinct
just
isnt
that
good
i
do
not
know
if
i
had
a
bad
batch
but
from
the
people
i
asked
i
get
mixed
reviews
this
is
a
tolorable
beer
ice
cold
but
at
any
other
condition
i
find
it
nearly
undrinkable
sigh
the
bottle
is
unique
comically
so
pale
yellow
with
no
head
it
smells
like
skunky
lightlycopperscented
playdoh
it
tastes
lightly
skunky
and
artificially
sweet
i
like
the
pear
that
i
can
taste
before
the
hops
set
in
bleh
later
in
the
taste
comes
the
horrible
artificial
sweetness
again
dont
intend
to
make
this
a
regular
but
id
drink
it
if
offered
drinkability
i
guess
it
depends
on
the
circumstance
if
im
stateside
ill
pick
something
else
but
if
im
in
jamaica
and
u
s
imports
are
45
bucks
a
can
while
a
fresh
nonskunked
red
stripe
is
a
dollar
ill
go
with
the
stripe
unfortunately
for
the
marketers
of
this
beer
the
odds
of
me
going
to
jamaica
anytime
soon
are
slim
12
oz
stubby
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
shade
darker
than
your
average
macro
with
a
half
inch
off
white
head
that
leaves
little
lace
smells
of
malts
with
some
corn
and
a
bit
of
metal
the
flavor
is
this
plus
a
hint
of
lemon
a
trace
of
alcohol
and
a
light
body
that
is
crisp
and
tingly
its
easy
to
drink
but
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
poured
a
one
finger
head
that
left
the
building
prematurely
nice
yellow
to
the
color
definitely
not
just
water
has
a
malty
thick
mouthfeel
for
a
lager
smells
and
tastes
all
stylistically
appropriate
but
a
little
on
the
subdued
side
making
this
beer
a
taste
dissappointment
not
bad
however
and
quite
drinkable
considering
the
flare
of
other
cultural
gifts
from
jamaica
i
expected
an
experience
here
that
simply
did
not
come
to
fruition
plentiful
foam
that
dies
a
quick
death
and
lightly
laces
very
light
shade
of
gold
to
hue
and
crystal
clear
mute
washing
machine
remnants
on
nose
with
just
a
light
lemony
hue
and
wail
passable
just
barely
corn
presence
that
has
just
an
echo
of
malt
and
hops
are
but
a
distant
memory
given
the
right
circumstances
like
drinking
in
lawn
chairs
in
a
yard
of
freshly
cut
grass
moving
the
chairs
and
the
cooler
full
of
lager
to
follow
the
sun
this
could
be
fun
but
those
circumstances
are
few
and
far
between
bought
a
6
pack
of
these
nice
touch
with
the
stubbie
bottles
white
and
red
silkscreened
logo
import
abv
for
canada
is
5
pours
out
a
medium
gold
in
colour
lots
of
carbonation
which
induces
a
decent
sized
white
fizzy
head
with
some
pretty
impressive
head
retention
for
a
caribbean
lager
although
not
offensive
the
smell
isnt
too
pretty
either
crisp
malt
and
corn
adjunct
up
front
with
a
hint
of
veggies
lurking
in
the
background
the
taste
follows
along
the
same
lines
not
completely
offensive
but
not
overly
appealing
either
sweet
corn
and
malt
up
front
a
bit
grainy
and
husky
in
the
middle
with
a
surprising
lightly
hopped
aftertaste
although
im
assuming
those
are
hops
as
they
just
sort
of
creep
in
there
under
your
nose
the
mouthfeel
goes
from
smooth
and
creamy
to
carbonated
and
mildly
abrasive
in
a
short
amount
of
time
adding
a
bit
of
kick
to
the
finish
and
aftertaste
some
jekyll
and
hyde
action
going
on
in
that
respect
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
experience
an
average
lager
at
best
it
is
still
drinkable
as
a
lawnmower
beer
or
a
hot
day
quencher
but
not
something
youd
savour
for
the
aroma
or
the
flavour
drinkability
this
has
always
been
a
good
standby
or
session
beer
for
me
a
great
beach
brew
or
beer
on
a
real
hot
day
i
finally
got
the
courage
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
red
stripe
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
was
recommended
this
beer
by
a
bud
light
drinker
so
i
had
some
reservations
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
is
a
very
light
golden
color
and
has
no
head
after
10
seconds
but
it
smells
tasty
a
pleasant
sweetness
and
even
hops
for
an
adjunct
lager
this
is
fantastic
it
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
almost
citrusy
and
follows
with
a
very
mild
hop
bite
but
again
for
what
it
is
it
is
surprising
who
knew
that
jamaicans
could
brew
good
beer
and
fantastic
reefer
i
am
so
there
i
like
the
stubby
bottle
cute
big
fluffy
white
head
over
a
soft
glowing
pale
yellow
glow
nice
smells
of
honey
malts
lightly
sugared
rice
chex
and
lightly
europungeant
hops
not
skunked
but
kinda
good
skunky
not
bad
at
all
lightly
sweet
grainy
cereal
malt
flavors
up
front
tangy
lightly
bitter
hop
taste
comes
on
into
the
finish
finish
is
vegetal
bittersweet
and
surprisingly
long
lightbodied
with
good
crisp
refreshing
carbonation
one
of
the
better
adj
lagers
ive
had
a
clean
very
pale
yellowstraw
colored
beer
has
a
big
bright
white
fizzy
head
there
is
a
light
sweet
grassy
aroma
and
not
much
else
the
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
citrusy
lemon
but
all
of
that
is
washed
away
by
the
watery
mouthfeel
and
watery
finish
bought
this
beer
in
a
bottle
and
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
nice
rich
golden
color
pours
with
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
beautiful
lace
the
nose
smells
like
cabbage
grainy
the
taste
is
grainy
adjuncts
with
a
nice
bitter
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
about
what
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
for
a
bbq
or
sittting
on
the
beach
on
a
hot
day
not
among
jamaicas
finer
products
lots
of
trendy
hipster
douches
drink
this
beer
that
doesnt
mean
it
is
bad
though
if
this
brew
is
at
a
trenday
suck
bar
and
nothing
else
besides
bud
yeah
i
will
get
it
the
screenprinted
grenade
bottle
kicks
ass
not
much
going
on
here
the
hops
are
there
but
quiet
nothing
special
but
i
will
take
it
over
a
lot
in
certain
bars
its
a
pissyellow
fizzy
beer
with
a
sodalike
foamy
white
mostlydiminishing
head
and
speckled
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
aroma
is
malts
and
corn
and
that
rather
nasty
stink
that
is
commonplace
among
adjuncts
served
cold
enough
the
odor
isnt
too
much
of
a
problem
the
taste
is
light
light
malt
dough
and
a
slight
lemon
zest
in
there
that
is
nice
a
little
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
the
finish
is
short
and
crisp
and
the
bitterness
is
kicked
up
a
little
bit
by
the
fizziness
nothing
really
special
here
but
its
very
good
on
a
hot
humid
day
and
it
goes
well
with
spicy
foods
id
pick
this
one
over
most
american
macro
adjuncts
but
the
price
is
a
deterrent
pours
your
average
beer
color
with
no
visual
eye
candy
to
even
note
on
faint
bready
malt
aroma
with
a
light
hoppy
floweriness
and
a
seriously
faulty
cooked
corn
and
sulfur
aroma
some
mineral
qualities
in
the
water
show
through
but
overall
pretty
nasty
smelling
whoa
it
gets
worse
dimethyl
sulfide
plays
a
significant
role
in
this
beers
flavor
profile
a
bit
of
diacetyl
too
shameful
in
a
lager
theres
a
moderate
maltiness
a
light
floweriness
in
the
finish
and
its
carbonated
thats
about
as
positive
of
a
spin
as
i
can
put
on
this
beer
if
i
had
a
dog
im
not
sure
i
would
even
give
this
beer
to
it
sampled
about
4
oz
and
then
drainsville
joey
drinkability
is
ok
since
its
watery
i
could
drink
water
all
night
honestly
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
there
are
just
many
others
out
there
that
are
better
but
in
my
opinion
every
beer
is
worth
a
try
a
bit
fizzy
and
a
little
thin
but
very
refreshing
this
would
be
great
in
the
summer
straw
colored
very
pale
lightly
golden
with
a
thin
filmy
head
the
aroma
is
flat
and
uninviting
detected
some
sweet
and
sour
bitter
grains
fairly
musty
and
even
a
bit
soapy
taste
is
bittersweet
again
soapy
and
lemony
has
a
small
grainy
body
but
not
really
malty
i
have
had
this
beer
in
the
past
and
found
it
to
be
moderately
enjoyable
although
unexpressive
and
a
bit
muddled
this
isnt
that
bad
i
guess
you
can
say
its
fabtaboulessly
mediocre
overalla
slightly
more
than
solid
lager
its
adjunct
filled
but
still
retains
a
decent
flavor
and
smooth
quality
and
it
is
distinctive
however
at
9
49
a
sixpack
at
my
local
store
i
cannot
justify
it
an
interesting
beer
to
try
that
should
satisfy
though
better
than
bud
miller
or
coors
and
ill
be
damned
if
it
didnt
wash
down
the
spicy
chicken
wings
i
had
incredibly
well
when
you
pour
a
red
stripe
the
color
is
quite
worrisome
very
yellow
and
extremely
carbonated
there
was
also
very
little
head
and
no
lace
whatsoever
it
is
very
light
in
aroma
and
flavor
the
hops
are
sweet
and
barely
present
also
in
the
flavor
are
notes
of
honey
and
pineapple
more
of
a
warm
waether
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
in
the
dead
of
autumn
it
makes
me
think
of
the
caribbean
i
know
people
who
love
this
beer
but
it
is
always
tied
to
their
memories
of
consuming
it
on
vacation
i
used
to
drink
this
a
lot
after
cub
games
at
the
wild
hare
frog
sanctuary
the
wild
hare
is
big
reggae
bar
located
just
south
of
wrigley
great
post
game
atmosphere
with
free
bands
however
as
a
standalone
beer
the
experience
is
not
that
great
to
me
this
beer
has
a
very
pleasant
taste
to
it
and
goes
well
with
foods
normally
associated
with
summer
cookouts
although
it
is
average
in
about
all
categories
not
outstanding
but
definately
not
bad
the
taste
is
something
that
appears
to
differ
from
person
to
person
as
most
people
i
know
are
divided
on
their
liking
of
it
i
also
feel
that
their
commercials
and
bottles
are
great
however
that
definately
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
good
the
beer
is
definitely
the
class
of
the
caribbean
beers
that
ive
tried
hardly
impressive
but
good
drinkability
for
what
it
is
red
stripe
is
an
ideal
lawnmower
beer
and
has
some
complexities
and
character
that
its
regional
competitorscarib
lack
i
could
survive
nicely
with
this
if
i
got
stuck
in
a
jamaican
beach
town
for
a
couple
of
months
poured
a
piss
yellow
with
only
a
faint
dusting
of
lace
nothing
overly
outstanding
about
the
smell
taste
was
a
nice
mix
of
malt
and
hops
but
kind
of
boring
a
light
washing
mouthfeel
but
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
i
would
prefer
to
get
this
free
instead
of
buying
it
if
we
all
reviewed
this
beer
on
a
beach
in
negril
i
bet
the
marks
would
be
higher
but
alas
out
of
context
this
is
an
ok
lager
that
offers
no
surprises
but
on
the
other
hand
is
very
drinkable
the
slight
fruit
notes
in
the
finish
was
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
which
otherwise
is
a
standard
macro
lager
meant
for
sun
and
sand
i
prefer
alpine
from
down
east
or
even
pbr
as
this
beer
demands
import
prices
okay
so
some
people
say
its
odd
drinking
a
jamaican
beer
in
africa
but
hey
its
available
so
why
not
comes
in
a
355ml
stubby
bottle
i
find
the
stubbies
a
bit
ackward
to
pour
when
compared
to
the
longnecks
stubbies
are
too
damn
easy
to
chug
outta
the
bottle
and
into
the
glass
anyways
its
a
standard
yellow
colour
not
too
light
so
its
a
piss
yellow
but
a
decent
lager
yellow
bit
of
a
head
id
say
less
than
a
full
finger
lace
sticks
to
the
rim
and
slowly
creeps
down
good
smell
dry
hops
grass
and
barley
bit
of
sulphur
as
well
though
not
much
to
turn
it
off
nice
even
balanced
taste
starts
out
with
a
mellow
sweet
malt
and
butter
mix
ending
with
a
bitter
dry
grass
and
hop
aftertaste
not
wow
tasting
but
i
cant
help
but
admire
the
balance
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
astringent
thin
not
watery
thin
but
thin
not
bad
though
its
a
very
drinkable
lager
one
ill
buy
again
makes
for
a
great
session
brew
and
goes
great
with
zebra
this
beer
presents
itself
as
a
very
clear
very
light
yellow
color
theres
a
white
bright
moderately
sized
head
and
a
cornlike
vegetable
aroma
just
a
little
hop
aromavery
faint
the
taste
is
delicate
slightly
grainy
and
just
a
bit
astringent
very
little
hops
in
the
finish
and
the
overall
impression
is
light
clean
and
very
easy
to
drink
its
refreshing
but
also
hollow
better
than
a
typical
macro
but
not
by
much
bottle
is
a
retrostyle
like
old
malt
liquors
or
haffenreffers
private
stock
appearance
is
very
light
gold
straw
colored
like
an
american
macro
bmc
except
a
bit
darker
very
mild
nose
there
really
isnt
one
the
taste
is
better
than
the
average
yellow
bmc
because
it
does
still
have
some
flavor
and
would
be
far
more
thirst
quenching
on
a
hot
beach
in
jamaica
than
those
other
3
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fuzzyalmost

but
not
in

not

drinkablity
on
this
one
is
largely
dependent
on
the
circumstances
if
it
is

it

to

of

taste
is
much
richer
and
maltier
than
most

notes
of

with

mouthfeel
is
a

more

style
too
good

extremely
drinkable
better
than

imo
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
red
stripe
they
have
a
frisky
beer
to
go
with
their
cutesy
advertising
campaign
all
in
all
a
good
beer
the
body
is
a
little
thin
when
drank
from
a
glass
another
reason
to
drink
it
straight
from
a
bottle
the
carbonation
is
fairly
light
and
makes
these
little
guys
easy
to
drink
verdict
not
as
bad
as
i
remembered
it
i
wonder
what
i
found
so
distasteful
before
because
theres
really
nothing
here
good
or
bad
a
good
summertime
quaffer
for
those
hot
days
you
want
something
inoffensive
to
drink
and
forget
about
i
guess
i
realized
that
in
college
this
was
a
great
beer
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle
on
keg
nights
not
in
a
pint
glass
in
a
restaurant
this
was
literally
as
clear
as
water
for
some
reason
i
always
kind
of
figured
that
it
was
a
fairly
dark
lager
i
can
however
see
how
it
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
beach
very
crisp
and
refreshing
for
a
drink
though

nothing
to

about

my
biggest
problem
was
that
no
matter
how
much
of
this
stuff
i
drank
but
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
with
a
touch
of

just
a

try
this

it
was
a

with

capped
with

the

was
a

dare

though
budweiser
only
made
in

it

only
you
drink
it
somewhere
in

night
markets
nothing
too
bad
your
average
good
looking
dinner
beer
but
the

gave
a

you

taste
is

on

hop
note
but
in
a
skunky
way
it
goes
excellent
with
spicy
chinese
food
and
is
very
drinkable
no
it
is
not
the
greatest
beer
ever
nor
does
it
have
a
complex
flavor
but
for
an
average
beer
to
enjoy
with
dinner
that
is
drinkable
its
a
good
bet
very
hard
beer
just
how
i
like
it
doesnt
need
salt
but
it
definitely
gives
it
that
extra
kick
if
youre
looking
to
add
a
beer
to
the
list
its
a
fine
choice
however
i
have
heard
there
are
many
better
chinese
beers
out
there
have
not
personally
had
one
overall
its
refreshing
enough
tastes
alright
bit
watered
down
and
looks
not
bad
so
so
light
drinking
feeling
enjoy
i
found
this
beer
to
be
cheaper
than
water
while
working
in
china
would
i
buy
it
back
home
no
would
i
buy
it
while
living
in
beijing
sure
why
not
this
just
was
not
good
the
initial
taste
was
quite
strong
a
little
sour
and
thereafter
some
malts
and
hay
a
bit
grainy
with
the
rice
making
an
appearance
a
nicely
balanced
beer
not
overbearing
with
a
lot
of
subtle
flavours
not
much
in
the
aftertaste
but
overall
this
beer
was
very
smooth
and
not
at
all
heavy
the
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
makes
this
one
of
the
most
sessionable
lagers
you
can
find
in
my
opinion
i
like
tsingtao
beer
its
not
going
to
get
you
wasted
but
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
them
without
having
to
worry
too
much
about
the
night
or
indeed
not
expect
a
bad
hangover
was
expecting
this
to
be
very
bad
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
clean
read
lack
of
bad
aftertaste
profile
not
a
good
beer
basically
a
typical
asian
adjunct
beer
but
okay
if
cold
could
be
worse
and
many
are
amazing
with
chinese
food
and
sirracha
its
great
with
asian
food
the
the
feeling
is
nice
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
tingle
on
the
back
of
the
throat
not
bad
sort
of
on
the
level
of
bud
nothing
special
by
any
means
pretty
sessionable
lager
that
is
moderately
priced
not
the
best
goin
round
please
piss
poor
beer
in
a
green
bottle
this
shouldnt
be
a
surprise
ive
had
this
twice
in
a
japanese
restaurant
and
at
the
time
i
thought
it
was
pretty
skunky
but
the
one
im
drinking
now
is
perfect
a
perfect
amount
of
skunk
but
the
beer
is
very
mild
would
defiantly
get
again
if
im
at
an
oriental
restaurant
this
is
my
choice
and
usually
only
choice
at
chinese
restaurants
its
got
a
strong
grain
flavor
and
usually
a
bit
of
skunky
aroma
with
some
mild
hop
bitterness
it
cleanses
the
palate
nicely
and
goes
well
with
the
cuisine
light
and
a
bit
skunky
great
served
ice
cold
poured
into
a
glass
next
to
a
big
plate
of
kung
pao
chicken
nice
pale
and
bubbly
no
head
to
speak
of
mild
grains
and
skunk
in
the
nose
flavor
is
dominated
by
skunked
rice
adjuncts
light
bodied
with
an
odd
slick
texture
i
drank
just
enough
to
write
this
review
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
o
good
light
rice
beer
refreshing
not
excellent
but
good
its
alright
great
with
food
chinese
food
but
would
never
buy
a
six
pack
of
the
stuff
its
got
a
funky
taste
to
it
not
bad
just
funky
73100
over
all
i
hate
to
be
mean
and
if
i
compare
this
to
other
beers
in
the
same
style
it
is
not
the
worst
in
the
world
if
you
like
a
budweiser
then
this
is
a
better
brew
i
think
if
you
like
ales
or
bitters
then
give
this
one
a
wide
berth
for
what
it
is
trying
to
be
it
does
the
job
i
just
dont
like
what
it
is
trying
to
be
my
final
score
is
based
on
the
fact
this
beer
is
doing
what
it
set
out
to
do
but
what
it
is
trying
to
be
is
not
interesting
or
even
difficult
to
do
however
there
are
worse
beers
in
this
style
smooth
for
when
you
have
a
spicy
dish
i
use
it
for
when
i
have
salt
n
peeper
wings
of
all
the
places
to
find
chinese
beer
i
didnt
think
bavaria
would
be
on
the
list
picked
it
up
cuz
i
wanted
to
try
something
different
good
thing
it
was
cheap
the
chinese
do
a
lot
of
things
very
well
beer
isnt
one
of
those
things
id
rate
this
beer
marginally
higher
than
bud
light
only
for
the
higher
alcohol
content
o
not
much
here
like
an
empty
shell
overall
sour
and
skunky
nothing
resembling
beer
pours
a
light
almost
clear
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
was
fermented
rice
almost
skunky
smell
the
taste
was
the
same
and
the
skunky
aftertaste
lasted
way
too
long
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
but
overall
i
wasnt
a
fan
it
is
too
similar
to
heineken
in
all
the
worst
ways
basically
has
the
flavor
and
taste
of
a
check
heineken
cant
say
if
recommend
buying
it
as
it
isnt
an
inexpensive
beer
flavor
and
smell
were
both
on
the
skunky
side
bottle
is
nice
again
when
has
the
bottle
designed
similarly
to
heineken
would
be
interesting
to
taste
it
out
of
a
can
day
beer
overall
my
first
beer
from
china
and
one
ive
wanted
to
try
since
beginning
to
study
chinese
last
fall
good
for
the
tick
but
not
something
i
have
the
desire
to
ever
have
again
would
try
again
if
this
came
canned
or
if
i
knew
it
was
fresh
and
not
lightstruck
this
should
match
perfectly
to
spicy
asian
food
its
always
tough
to
review
an
aal
since
its
a
category
fabricated
to
house
certain
subpar
beers
to
style
this
beer
isnt
all
that
bad
what
kills
it
is
the
green
bottle
and
the
skunk
that
follows
it
not
quite
as
bad
as
moosehead
but
its
up
there
the
head
was
quite
nice
for
an
aal
downhill
after
that
a
bit
too
sweet
and
grainhusky
well
we
had
a
beer
with
a
pale
watery
yellow
hue
that
resembles
a
low
end
american
lager
it
has
not
much
of
a
smell
and
believe
me
the
flavor
is
dead
as
well
mouthfeel
is
terrible
feels
like
im
drinking
cold
mineral
water
over
here
overall
i
rate
it
1
5
halfway
between
poor
and
awful
because
thats
what
it
is
only
ordered
it
because
i
was
a
chinese
joint
and
never
tried
the
darn
thing
adding
insult
to
injury
is
the
fact
that
i
blew
three
fifty
on
twelve
ounces
of
it
very
mediocre
lager
watery
flavorless
in
seconds
typical
skunk
aroma
however
the
appearance
is
ok
nice
body
and
decent
lacing
overall
this
beer
is
okay
because
the
taste
was
refreshing
to
me
that
i
could
drink
more
a
likley
thumbs
up
if
you
like
pale
brews
but
not
if
you
enjoy
stouts
straw
yellow
in
color
when
poured
with
no
real
head
lots
of
small
carbonation
what
i
would
expect
from
a
lager
smells
alright
sort
of
yeasty
not
strong
smell
not
much
flavor
tasted
like
a
watereddown
decent
lager
the
flavor
was
not
offensive
at
all
it
was
very
drinkable
just
not
much
there
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
dry
finish
nothing
special
if
someone
gave
me
one
i
could
certainly
drink
it
it
was
light
i
felt
like
a
could
drink
several
and
not
get
full
i
drank
it
with
dinner
it
was
fine
in
the
sense
it
did
not
compete
with
the
food
since
there
wasnt
a
strong
flavor
flavor
white
bread
sweet
malt
grass
slight
hops
in
the
finish
if
anyone
knows
where
to
get
this
unfiltered
nectar
in
a
can
please
let
me
know
until
then
ill
have
to
wait
until
i
make
it
over
to
qingdao
again
and
get
some
on
tap
a
classic
blah
american
adjunct
style
lager
bland
boring
and
plain
ol
funkyweird
but
hey
its
wet
and
sure
does
look
outstanding
delicious
easytodrink
lager
that
is
not
arrogant
pretentious
or
hangoveronthefirstsip
inducing
this
is
chinas
top
beer
and
realistically
the
only
good
beer
coming
out
of
china
today
multiple
flavors
red
label
green
label
more
tastes
better
on
draft
in
mainland
the
bottles
travel
ok
to
america
the
rest
meh
what
can
you
say
its
an
adjunct
lager
gets
you
buy
in
a
pinch
poured
from
the
green
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
super
pale
straw
yellow
brew
maybe
just
a
hair
darker
than
some
american
examples
of
the
adjunct
lager
with
the
expected
foaming
white
bubbles
filling
the
glass
beer
remains
fizzy
and
effervescent
throughout
smells
grainy
and
slightly
tangy
rank
waterlogged
barley
and
no
trace
of
corn
sweetness
rice
is
king
here
astringent
crisp
and
clean
other
than
the
aforementioned
wet
grain
notes
palate
benefits
from
a
cold
temperature
drink
up
quick
some
tangy
lemon
rind
and
grape
flavors
vaporous
and
fleeting
followed
by
old
grain
mill
or
malt
liquor
a
little
like
singha
but
no
where
near
as
flavorful
some
medicinal
aspirin
and
a
sour
metallic
tang
throughout
plastic
flavors
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
somewhat
skunky
another
feature
that
unfortunately
gains
salience
over
time
stripped
down
far
less
sweet
than
most
american
adjunct
beers
finishes
dry
and
with
an
unexpected
american
hop
currant
twang
but
this
feature
is
decidedly
subtle
meets
expectations
this
beer
may
very
well
complement
chinese
food
but
that
aint
going
to
bump
up
my
ratings
appearance
is
a
light
gold
decent
head
that
recedes
to
a
fat
ring
with
little
to
no
lacing
wet
cardboard
is
the
aroma
skunkiness
is
dialed
down
flavor
is
mineral
and
salt
a
bit
fairly
bland
but
a
tinge
of
flavor
is
found
not
offensive
but
not
really
what
im
shooting
for
in
a
beer
still
for
the
price
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
this
beer
had
its
moments
for
sure
id
say
above
average
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
tastes
like
a
watereddown
heineken
has
a
strong
skunky
smell
and
offers
a
thin
yet
offputting
body
that
basically
amounts
to
a
chinese
heineken
light
i
had
but
one
bottled
poured
into
a
glass
and
im
glad
i
did
for
the
sake
of
trying
it
but
i
will
never
pay
for
one
again
cant
recommend
this
one
nothing
special
chinas
version
of
an
american
macrolager
overall
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
here
in
china
you
can
get
one
of
these
big
bottles
for
less
than
a
dollar
5
rmb
unless
you
are
at
one
of
shanghais
fine
nighttime
drinking
establishments
in
which
the
price
can
of
course
range
anywhere
from
2
to
10
dollars
1250
rmb
for
something
typical
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
you
could
do
much
worse
than
this
one
probably
one
of
the
better
mass
produced
chinese
lagers
ill
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
again
and
again
overall
it
is
whats
available
in
china
and
it
is
one
of
their
best
beers
it
is
thirst
quenching
and
is
excellent
for
the
last
days
of
summer
and
the
transition
into
fall
are
there
better
lagers
out
there
yes
does
this
one
hit
the
spot
hmmm
sure
i
was
morbidly
curious
as
to
what
a
chinese
beer
would
actually
taste
like
was
surprised
in
a
decent
way
not
exactly
a
stellar
beer
but
fit
the
chinese
food
we
were
eating
well
was
a
more
refreshing
light
kind
of
beer
than
anything
else
i
would
recommend
if
youre
not
looking
for
anything
fancy
and
want
to
try
something
new
despite
the
atrocious
smell
of
this
through
its
actually
quite
delightful
it
is
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
leaves
a
good
aftertaste
it
has
great
flavor
and
is
always
enjoyable
hands
down
my
favorite
chinese
beer
and
also
one
of
my
select
choice
beers
personally
as
well
i
would
always
recommend
tsingtao
on
its
own
i
could
not
session
thisat
all
this
is
for
me
is
a
beer
food
the
sweetness
and
lower
carbonation
pair
well
with
wasabi
soy
ginger
sushi
sweet
and
sours
etc
i
would
definitely
get
again
at
asian
restaurants
overall
i
give
this
beer
a
low
score
however
i
will
try
it
again
from
another
establishment
and
see
if
it
was
just
that
particular
bottle
that
did
indeed
get
skunked
apple
juice
color
almost
no
head
fades
quickly
decent
lacing
slow
rising
carbonation
not
really
a
discernible
smell
taste
is
better
than
the
appearance
and
smell
would
suggest
starts
very
carbonated
finishes
very
smooth
with
a
great
malty
taste
leaves
a
pleasurable
aftertaste
overall
not
bad
it
was
my
first
ever
chinese
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
overall
ah
easy
drinking
and
moderately
refreshing
but
nothing
really
good
in
this
one
o
a
pretty
poor
beer
in
all
aspects
besides
the
aftertaste
better
than
most
euro
pale
lagers
o
beer
is
quite
bland
but
nonoffensive
goes
best
with
spicy
foods
one
of
my
least
favorite
of
the
asian
beers
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
drinkably
light
but
thats
about
it
it
has
a
really
strong
adjunct
metallic
flavor
and
the
finish
is
mineral
heavy
and
always
a
tad
skunky
no
matter
where
it
comes
from
im
not
sure
if
there
is
rice
or
corn
in
this
but
it
tastes
starchy
sweet
for
the
wrong
reasons
and
it
is
unsettling
in
the
stomach
after
a
few
of
them
it
always
seems
to
be
available
at
the
asian
eateries
but
i
much
prefer
sapporo
or
asahi
or
even
tiger
or
kirin
to
this
it
is
bright
enough
to
cleanse
the
palate
but
it
almost
has
a
chemical
preservative
sort
of
finish
to
it
that
just
really
turns
me
off
maybe
at
the
source
this
beer
would
be
something
to
try
again
but
for
now
its
one
i
stay
away
form
when
there
are
other
options
in
front
of
me
wouldnt
this
be
a
chinese
adjunct
lager
whatever
nothing
different
here
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
mug
clear
pale
straw
color
ample
and
quickly
dissipating
white
head
no
lacing
nose
is
quite
sour
tastes
of
lime
with
a
faint
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
background
but
neither
malt
nor
hop
notes
are
recognizeable
actually
quite
reminiscent
of
radler
a
mixture
of
light
lager
and
sprite
and
a
popular
summer
refreshment
in
germany
thin
highly
carbonated
what
i
did
like
was
the
aroma
of
this
beer
it
smells
like
hay
and
there
were
some
herbs
and
grass
smells
can
be
found
at
almost
any
good
asian
restaurant
out
pours
a
nice
pale
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
lively
carbonation
but
it
fades
away
fast
faint
aroma
of
malt
sweet
corn
light
grains
and
no
bitterness
the
combination
of
a
thin
body
low
carbonation
and
sweet
taste
works
well
with
oriental
foods
overall
its
not
bad
maybe
a
little
watery
but
works
great
as
a
thirstquencher
good
in
the
summer
and
the
best
accompaniment
i
know
of
to
chinese
food
particularly
very
spicy
chinese
food
reminiscent
of
a
chinese
heineken
except
with
an
odd
medicinal
aftertaste
that
became
increasingly
difficult
to
drink
as
it
warmed
decent
to
drink
with
chinese
food
but
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
at
import
premiums
i
also
laughed
when
i
encountered
the
u
s
packaging
touting
tsingtao
as
the
number
1
selling
chinese
beer
in
the
usa
overall
my
favorite
pilsner
distinctly
crisp
clean
fresh
and
hoppy
with
none
of
the
soapy
flavor
or
yeasty
smell
of
macro
lagers
its
a
great
lunchtime
beer
it
beats
anything
else
in
the
category
than
i
can
think
of
and
the
bad
reviews
of
this
enjoyable
beer
simply
dont
make
any
sense
onot
terribly
appealing
little
flavor
overall
the
smell
is
very
skunky
and
prevalent
while
the
flavor
is
almost
nonexistent
although
im
not
sure
if
i
would
want
to
taste
the
beer
if
it
were
made
earlier
just
based
on
the
smell
i
was
getting
o
a
chugging
beer
will
not
have
again
this
isnt
the
best
tasting
drink
but
it
is
very
light
it
would
be
easy
to
kill
a
bunch
of
these
to
get
drunk
if
thats
how
you
roll
not
terrible
but
just
below
average
nothing
interesting
or
good
here
very
unoffensive
very
noninteresting
but
not
really
bad
o
not
very
good
refreshing
at
least
overall
an
old
chinese
restaurant
standby
pairs
well
with
most
offerings
but
goes
especially
well
with
spicy
dishes
like
generals
chicken
or
kung
pao
shrimp
light
smell
of
citrus
taste
is
flat
with
no
carbonation
feelable
in
the
mouth
as
a
beer
for
a
warm
day
this
beers
does
its
job
no
more
and
no
less
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
smells
of
grain
and
a
hint
of
earth
and
little
else
the
flavor
is
light
grain
with
some
earth
and
a
slight
mineral
metallic
flavor
light
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
even
for
a
light
lager
this
leaves
much
to
be
desired
light
body
with
minimal
flavor
had
this
in
nyc
chinatown
and
was
a
nice
complement
to
the
meal
surprisingly
pleasant
lager
washes
down
my
hoedubbap
and
kimchi
rather
well
3
5
a
passable
lager
but
nothing
special
perhaps
it
stands
out
well
in
china
at
least
the
taste
is
clean
if
uninspiring
ok
if
theres
nothing
else
going
but
no
need
to
seek
it
out
this
started
as
just
another
import
skunky
and
unpleasant
the
flavor
however
is
much
different
the
flavor
has
a
light
malt
character
and
a
moderate
grassy
hop
character
the
drinkability
is
great
crisp
clean
refreshing
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
out
there
transparent
yellow
in
body
with
white
bubbly
head
that
fades
fast
aroma
of
most
adjunct
lagers
light
grain
and
hops
tastes
of
light
grains
hop
bitterness
a
bit
grassy
and
some
sweetness
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
such
an
easy
drinker
that
doesnt
gross
me
out
overall
some
surprises
with
this
one
actually
a
decent
beer
for
the
genre
serving
type
bottle
overall
one
of
the
better
chinese
beers
ive
had
just
another
average
beer
o
this
beer
isnt
overly
flavorful
but
it
probably
be
a
good
accompaniment
to
chinese
food
if
you
were
looking
for
something
other
than
water
to
help
wash
down
spicy
dishes
o
not
bad
i
kind
of
equate
this
beer
to
the
heineken
of
china
especially
because
of
the
slightly
skunky
smell
due
to
the
green
bottle
this
beer
is
light
and
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
anything
special
i
will
likely
has
this
again
but
not
because
i
have
a
really
high
opinion
of
it
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavors
and
aromas
despite
the
smell
this
isnt
really
that
offensive
its
too
sweet
and
utterly
lacks
taste
it
has
the
body
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
with
about
as
much
or
less
flavor
as
a
light
lager
i
dont
know
when
i
would
ever
drink
this
again
but
i
must
once
again
note
that
this
isnt
awful
just
bad
overall
a
pretty
poor
beer
i
have
had
worse
though
overall
a
beer
that
i
wont
be
purchasing
again
but
its
not
atrocious
t
luckily
the
taste
wasnt
skunky
like
the
smell
unfortunately
it
still
wasnt
good
a
bit
of
lemon
and
pale
malt
and
maybe
a
bit
of
boiled
corn
strange
sour
grainy
taste
on
finish
not
really
a
fan
o
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
as
i
had
a
professor
of
chinese
studies
highly
recommend
it
apparently
she
has
never
had
any
other
kind
of
beer
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
not
more
readily
available
in
the
united
states
would
definitely
not
recommend
o
wow
i
would
like
to
drink
this
with
some
chinese
food
i
had
this
with
some
japanese
food
the
other
day
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
is
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
immediately
leaving
no
lacing
it
smells
slightly
skunky
with
a
hint
of
noble
hops
and
somewhat
grassy
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
as
there
is
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
but
is
dominated
by
the
malts
not
a
lot
of
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
carbonated
overall
nothing
special
but
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
i
will
probably
never
drink
this
again
overall
tastes
similar
to
lowenbrau
so
if
you
like
imported
premium
type
lagers
this
is
for
you
really
not
bad
when
nice
and
cold
as
it
warms
up
just
a
bit
the
flaws
of
the
style
start
to
show
it
is
hard
to
describe
but
it
must
just
lack
a
balance
that
beer
brewed
with
more
hops
and
malt
displays
a
decent
adjunct
lager
wellbalanced
with
no
genuinely
annoying
flaws
to
gripe
about
refreshing
and
serviceable
enough
but
i
doubt
most
people
would
have
trouble
finding
a
cheaper
domestic
equivalent
not
really
worth
trying
unless
youre
at
a
chinese
restaurant
and
dont
have
other
options
o
decent
and
probably
only
come
back
to
it
depending
upon
what
else
was
served
o
a
pretty
basic
lager
but
perfect
for
chinese
food
o
this
beer
is
a
bit
to
light
to
when
drinking
it
with
spicy
dishes
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
therefore
it
is
a
real
thirst
quencher
this
beer
does
not
thrill
but
it
does
have
a
smooth
feel
that
seems
to
slide
across
the
tongue
and
goes
down
with
little
effort
overall
a
good
adjunct
and
i
much
prefer
it
to
budweiser
and
the
like
i
dont
need
to
be
eating
chinese
food
to
enjoy
it
o
it
looks
like
i
wont
be
in
the
market
for
any
chinese
beers
after
this
one
o
unfortunately
i
didnt
like
this
beer
at
all
even
paired
with
chinese
food
which
i
was
hoping
would
go
good
with
it
im
looking
at
the
full
glass
i
have
left
and
wondering
if
ill
be
able
to
finish
it
overall
this
is
a
fairly
bland
lager
but
it
is
my
goto
beer
at
the
chinese
buffet
its
the
only
chinese
beer
i
typically
see
in
local
chinese
restaurants
and
i
prefer
it
to
any
domestic
macros
or
just
having
water
at
dinner
certainly
nothing
great
in
a
beer
but
its
not
bad
either
o
easily
drinkable
and
a
bit
more
flavourful
than
most
mass
produced
export
ales
but
still
rather
weak
great
cottage
drinking
ale
or
the
kind
you
crave
after
mowing
the
lawn
overall
not
too
bad
but
still
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
imo
there
are
better
asian
lagers
to
have
with
chinese
food
summary
im
really
not
impressed
by
this
brew
again
not
good
by
itself
but
decent
with
some
food
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
beer
is
crisp
would
be
great
on
the
porch
watching
the
sun
go
down
this
has
to
be
the
chinese
budweiser
at
any
rate
its
good
maybe
one
day
when
i
visit
china
i
can
drink
one
with
the
natives
yummy
bottoms
up
people
o
better
than
what
i
expected
nothing
special
at
all
its
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
or
drink
regularly
but
its
a
decent
option
in
a
chinese
restaurant
because
chinese
restaurants
normally
do
not
have
good
beer
selections
i
would
drink
this
again
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
bubbly
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
broken
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
grain
corn
flakes
and
grassyherbal
aromas
taste
is
of
the
toasted
grains
corn
flakes
and
slight
honey
this
beer
has
a
pretty
average
mouthfeel
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
texture
overall
this
is
my
first
beer
from
china
and
i
think
its
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
o
not
bad
just
leaves
you
wanting
more
light
for
a
lager
would
probably
do
well
with
heavier
spicy
asian
food
this
is
beer
i
will
say
it
didnt
actually
taste
bad
but
it
didnt
taste
good
either
id
rather
drink
water
overall
fine
for
sessioning
good
for
washing
down
snacks
but
cant
stand
on
its
own
very
comparable
to
the
other
worlds
large
brewers
which
is
both
its
blessing
and
its
curse
i
will
inevitably
have
it
again
as
i
currently
live
here
in
the
home
of
tsingtao
beer
but
if
given
a
choice
i
would
pick
something
with
more
flavor
updated
after
drinking
it
from
a
640ml
bottle
dwould
like
to
review
this
one
fresh
but
since
i
have
no
plans
to
visit
china
anytime
soon
this
will
have
to
suffice
is
it
fair
to
review
an
obviously
skunked
beer
yes
the
tsingtao
company
needs
to
get
its
act
together
and
drop
the
green
glass
act
that
seems
to
fool
only
stupid
yuppies
in
america
trying
to
impress
people
with
their
imported
swill
yeah
its
from
china
but
its
not
much
different
from
any
other
adjunct
lager
pours
a
pale
watery
goldenstraw
color
with
a
puff
of
white
head
that
fizzles
down
to
nearly
nothing
aroma
of
weak
grains
and
a
passing
touch
of
hops
with
the
classic
green
bottle
skunk
taste
of
watereddown
grains
and
corn
funk
and
skunk
harsh
and
metallic
light
and
watery
mouthfeel
and
definitely
to
be
avoided
at
all
costs
flavor
is
light
just
a
hint
of
hop
sharpness
cut
by
the
carbonation
of
the
beer
when
served
super
cold
its
the
simple
lager
style
that
can
be
refreshing
it
the
hot
months
carbonated
cold
and
in
no
way
complex
its
great
for
after
a
run
just
know
that
youre
not
getting
a
beer
thats
going
to
challenge
your
palate
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
very
small
white
head
aroma
is
very
grainy
with
a
very
faint
hoppy
character
the
body
is
extremely
light
and
hardly
any
hops
or
malts
are
noticeable
very
skunky
and
watery
to
be
quite
honest
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
tried
this
was
a
drain
pour
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
i
just
could
not
bring
myself
to
suffer
any
longer
for
the
record
im
used
to
some
fairly
pisspoor
australian
lagers
but
this
is
just
so
much
worse
just
based
on
the
colour
alone
i
didnt
want
to
drink
it
yes
it
looked
like
urine
the
smell
was
ok
but
it
just
let
itself
down
in
so
many
other
areas
easily
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
reviewed
food
match
im
gonna
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
say
chinese
food
of
course
that
probably
means
nothing
to
someone
who
is
actually
chinese
chinese
food
as
seen
by
western
eyes
is
a
mixed
bag
of
what
is
a
large
and
diverse
cuisine
no
doubt
but
you
get
what
i
mean
beer
3
for
reviewing
here
in
china
tsingtao
is
everywhere
seemingly
in
china
its
not
too
bad
not
too
good
just
something
to
go
with
the
good
food
youre
having
sitting
in
the
fc
lounge
in
hong
kong
on
my
way
to
singapore
and
i
am
trying
the
tsingtao
beer
from
a
can
the
appearance
is
fine
clear
golden
color
with
good
carbonation
that
provides
a
minimal
white
head
the
smell
is
dominated
by
grain
the
taste
is
over
powered
with
grain
and
comes
off
the
pallete
a
bit
bitter
toward
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
like
rubbing
dry
wheat
on
your
tongue
then
washing
the
dust
down
with
water
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
another
one
of
these
nothing
to
see
here
get
only
in
a
pinch
o
a
light
and
easy
to
drink
beer
not
really
my
favorite
but
it
goes
well
with
a
chinese
meal
this
beer
is
okay
like
any
other
adjunct
lager
but
more
watery
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
good
when
eating
spicy
foods
at
asian
restaurants
still
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
at
a
store
again
quite
drinkable
in
this
context
but
not
otherwise
pours
clear
yellowgold
with
a
half
finger
of
foam
aroma
is
abhorrent
cabbage
cooked
corn
and
skunkiness
first
sip
is
better
than
it
smells
thankfully
finishes
pretty
dry
with
minimal
sweetness
not
much
flavor
whatsoever
honestly
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
o
a
standard
import
adjunct
nothing
exciting
but
it
goes
down
easily
enough
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
simplicity
and
how
light
and
clean
it
is
this
style
can
be
overly
metallic
or
adjuncty
but
here
we
found
the
product
to
finish
fairly
smoothly
and
without
too
much
extraneous
junk
abarwithnoname
wordpress
com
okay
beer
but
just
average
and
simple
maybe
next
time
ill
match
this
with
chineses
food
would
be
better
not
as
bad
as
i
will
admit
i
thought
this
would
be
adjunct
sure
but
nothing
to
really
ruin
things
drinks
like
a
soda
overall
drinkability
started
off
rough
around
the
corners
but
this
beer
grew
on
me
noticeably
by
the
time
i
finished
tsingtao
is
the
chinese
beer
that
i
never
had
a
particular
reason
to
try
so
i
decided
to
give
is
a
shot
my
tsingtao
poured
from
the
can
with
next
to
no
head
over
a
clear
golden
body
it
really
looks
like
a
cup
of
chilled
piss
the
aroma
put
off
was
slightly
skanky
with
a
bit
of
citrus
the
taste
test
revealed
initial
grainy
maltiness
that
soon
gave
way
a
crisper
bitterness
that
has
some
citrus
quality
to
it
theres
some
prickliness
and
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
to
it
on
overall
drinkability
it
goes
down
like
a
charm
but
probably
because
theres
not
much
reason
to
reflect
on
this
one
the
only
poor
point
is
probably
the
smell
while
the
rest
render
it
merely
a
decent
means
by
which
to
get
drunk
d
if
this
is
all
you
have
youll
drink
it
and
session
on
it
believe
me
but
if
youre
in
most
places
where
choice
is
available
wave
this
one
on
by
bleh
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
12
white
fizzy
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
crisp
clean
pilsner
malt
and
adjunct
scent
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
they
must
have
used
a
ton
of
cornrice
in
this
beer
the
malt
aroma
is
so
faint
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
quaffable
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
so
clean
no
defects
present
there
is
little
malt
or
hop
character
either
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
drinkable
beer
its
light
and
refreshing
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
d
this
is
a
very
light
refreshing
beer
that
is
both
simple
and
solid
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
it
does
not
define
the
style
overall
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
but
like
many
beers
in
this
category
it
is
not
groundbreaking
or
complex
i
always
imagine
when
having
a
beer
from
another
country
that
its
going
to
be
an
interesting
and
unique
experience
instead
the
sensation
i
get
from
tsingtao
is
that
im
having
a
beer
from
a
brewery
that
rhymes
with
schmanheusertush
pours
clear
very
pale
yellow
color
very
fast
fading
thin
white
head
aroma
is
very
faint
sweet
malty
id
say
flavour
reminds
me
of
cardboard
and
some
cheap
white
wine
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
odd
taste
in
mouth
afterwards
usually
drunk
at
thai
or
chinese
restaurant
its
a
decent
beer
to
try
once
in
awhile
i
dont
think
ive
ever
seen
it
in
the
store
but
its
readily
available
at
chinese
restaurants
in
the
area
saw
this
at
the
lcbo
in
ontario
and
just
grabbed
one
bottle
of
a
broken
six
pack
this
is
my
first
beer
from
china
pours
the
lightest
yellow
colour
ive
seen
with
a
beer
very
close
to
clear
white
head
dissipates
pretty
quickly
with
some
spots
of
lacing
smells
of
grainy
malt
and
not
much
else
the
slightest
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
flavour
but
it
is
close
to
carbonated
water
pretty
much
nothing
wrong
with
this
other
the
lack
of
flavour
i
purchased
a
22
ounce
bomber
of
this
at
the
local
hibachi
style
restaraunt
the
beer
pours
a
clean
yellowgold
color
with
no
head
it
has
a
typical
lager
smell
although
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
the
beer
is
crisp
and
light
in
mouth
with
sour
undertones
weak
barley
notes
to
the
flavor
the
beer
has
a
clean
crisp
finish
with
no
discernable
aftertaste
decent
beer
to
go
along
with
the
meal
because
you
didnt
have
to
worry
about
it
interfering
with
any
of
the
food
flavors
there
is
not
much
going
on
in
that
bottle
light
grains
and
a
floral
malty
sweetness
das
drinkable
as
water
like
i
said
kind
of
an
odd
thin
grape
juice
flavor
other
than
that
just
inoffensive
bland
and
oh
hum
drinkability
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
would
be
great
during
the
summer
very
thirst
quenching
and
refreshing
lacks
a
bit
in
flavor
but
a
beer
for
socializing
without
complexity
a
beer
one
wouldnt
have
to
ponder
or
try
to
analyze
too
much
d
my
first
china
beer
not
the
best
beer
ever
pretty
average
overall
nothing
to
run
out
and
look
for
d
easy
drinking
and
slightly
watery
this
beer
did
not
stand
out
but
it
paired
well
with
my
chinese
food
this
beer
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
everyday
beers
since
i
have
started
drinking
it
many
of
my
pals
have
started
to
like
it
also
replacing
some
of
their
everyday
beers
too
my
coworker
and
i
joked
about
it
being
the
only
thing
of
quality
coming
from
china
including
tsingtao
id
be
more
curious
to
try
any
of
the
frankly
stomachwrenching
fear
factoresque
delicacies
above
than
sit
through
another
bottle
of
this
insipid
conventional
massproduced
swill
not
that
its
so
bad
but
at
least
the
other
items
would
offer
flavour
excitement
novelty
and
an
authentic
reflection
of
chinese
gastronomy
pours
a
thin
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
grain
and
maybe
some
rice
and
a
little
hops
hiding
somewhere
in
there
tastes
of
grain
and
a
little
corn
some
bitterness
probably
from
some
hop
extract
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
nasty
feeling
drinkability
is
decent
pours
a
moderate
golden
straw
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
tiny
amount
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
my
glass
nose
is
lightly
skunked
hops
and
a
bit
of
grain
the
taste
is
light
grain
and
straw
with
some
mildly
herbal
hops
light
body
with
good
carbonation
not
a
great
beer
but
drinks
well
enough
drinkability
drank
it
all
but
didnt
order
another
d
okay
d
if
you
happen
across
a
chinese
restaurant
or
wake
up
in
shanghai
for
whatever
reason
you
could
probably
do
far
worse
than
this
overall
i
am
sure
it
would
pair
well
with
thai
or
a
spicy
chinese
dish
like
general
tsos
chicken
or
a
kung
pao
dish
why
not
drink
this
at
a
chinese
restaurant
instead
of
a
bmc
not
much
else
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
same
stuff
no
nuances
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
pricey
for
what
it
is
where
is
the
head
i
tried
but
even
with
aggressive
pouring
i
came
up
with
nothing
color
is
a
dark
yellow
rating
a
3
on
the
srm
chart
not
much
for
smell
some
rice
corn
malt
and
yeast
taste
is
clean
and
well
balanced
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
not
a
lot
of
excitement
in
the
mouthfeel
category
sort
of
watery
and
bland
it
gets
an
ok
rating
on
drinkability
as
there
is
not
a
lot
of
flavor
to
offend
much
food
and
it
is
an
import
tsingtao
is
good
with
chinese
food
or
other
spicy
foods
but
only
enjoyable
with
food
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
could
be
a
social
beer
amongst
my
chinese
friends
thanks
to
nesi
marc
for
the
sixer
this
pours
pale
yellow
and
clear
fizzy
white
head
no
lacing
it
smells
eurolagerish
with
some
hints
of
cooked
vegetables
and
grains
flavor
is
similar
sweet
with
a
light
mouthfeel
finishes
a
bit
sweet
as
well
the
label
says
brewed
with
the
finest
malt
although
i
suspect
theres
a
lot
of
corn
syrup
in
this
one
still
it
you
like
becks
this
one
is
usually
available
to
pair
with
some
good
chinese
food
d
drinkable
but
not
enjoyable
and
not
recommended
to
have
more
than
one
d
绝佳伴侣
forgive
me
chinese
speakers
i
have
no
idea
how
accurate
google
translator
is
for
the
word
drinkability
is
really
quite
good
a
first
sniff
from
the
green
glass
showed
a
modicum
of
skunk
good
lord
world
bottlers
why
do
you
insist
but
this
is
otherwise
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
common
adjunct
lager
i
had
no
problem
slurping
this
one
down
谢谢
my
friends
a
fairly
typical
knockoff
of
cheap
american
pilsners
the
head
dissipates
almost
immediately
you
get
some
skunking
green
glass
but
ive
had
worse
you
do
get
some
grassiness
as
well
as
basic
grains
in
the
taste
not
undrinkable
but
also
not
special
in
anyway
and
in
a
blind
taste
testing
id
have
guessed
this
came
from
the
us
not
china
rjt
d
goes
great
with
slightly
spicy
asian
cuisine
and
certainly
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
adjunct
lagers
pours
a
pale
straw
color
not
much
of
a
head
at
all
noticeable
carbonation
and
light
mouthfeel
typical
of
a
macro
lager
overall
appearance
is
very
much
like
a
bmc
taste
was
actually
better
than
i
expected
i
noticed
a
bit
of
skunkiness
when
opening
the
bottle
but
i
didnt
notice
any
off
taste
it
was
actually
sweeter
than
i
expected
would
probably
be
highly
drinkable
i
just
chose
this
one
after
a
hot
day
walking
about
in
the
city
and
it
was
agreeable
as
a
refresher
overall
this
is
not
bad
by
any
means
its
not
great
but
it
serves
its
purpose
well
well
after
an
abysmal
introduction
the
flavour
settles
down
to
that
of
a
simple
sweet
adjunct
lager
suitable
enough
for
fiery
ethnicadjacent
fare
and
absolutely
nothing
more
i
poured
into
my
pint
glass
to
a
fleeting
white
head
that
left
no
traces
that
it
was
ever
present
this
beer
is
yellow
in
color
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
surprisingly
there
is
no
skunk
smell
or
taste
since
it
does
come
in
a
green
bottle
the
taste
is
overtly
sweet
if
it
wasnt
so
sweet
it
actually
would
not
be
a
horrible
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
as
expected
it
is
probably
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
bright
yellow
color
with
good
clarity
started
with
a
thin
white
head
that
reducedto
a
healthy
cap
unlike
most
lagers
of
this
type
though
the
foam
was
creamier
and
left
some
respectable
lacings
very
light
sweet
malty
aroma
good
carbonation
and
a
light
body
feel
light
sweet
malty
flavor
nothing
spectacular
but
far
better
than
bud
miller
etc
easy
to
drink
drinkability
well
while
unimpressive
its
certainly
not
offensive
as
a
light
thirstquencher
this
would
do
the
trick
were
having
a
heat
wave
today
so
its
ok
the
glug
was
not
as
pronounced
coming
out
of
the
poptop
as
from
the
nowstandard
crackopen
cans
at
least
not
until
the
end
when
it
suddenly
rushed
out
it
was
the
case
of
the
mysterious
disappearing
head
as
one
second
it
was
there
and
in
the
next
it
was
gone
vaporized
color
was
a
pale
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
pretty
much
standard
for
the
style
a
light
lager
sweetness
underlain
by
a
cereal
smell
oh
well
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
sweetness
born
of
malt
and
adjuncts
on
the
tongue
i
am
getting
to
the
point
that
i
do
not
mind
the
better
ones
as
much
as
i
used
to
this
was
really
not
too
bad
i
know
damning
with
faint
praise
but
at
least
it
was
not
gaginducing
like
some
i
have
tried
finish
was
crisp
and
dry
fairly
refreshing
and
i
think
that
wei
need
to
remember
why
beers
of
the
style
are
referred
to
as
lawnmower
beers
they
are
not
intended
to
be
wildly
hoppy
or
big
in
abv
so
as
long
as
i
can
drink
it
down
it
will
get
a
satisfactory
review
drinkability
meh
kind
of
reminds
me
of
heineken
but
maybe
a
little
sweeter
fortunately
it
doesnt
get
really
bad
as
it
warms
as
heineken
does
d
a
decent
beer
ive
had
more
than
my
fair
share
of
these
over
the
years
due
to
the
taste
and
the
low
cost
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
honestly
i
can
think
of
several
of
the
style
that
simply
taste
much
better
i
kind
of
get
that
budweiseresk
rice
adjunct
flavor
but
not
nearly
to
that
extent
pretty
good
tasting
beer
though
does
the
trick
on
a
ridiculously
hot
day
like
today
a
darn
good
green
bottled
beer
and
tastes
like
a
green
bottled
beer
i
compared
it
to
becks
or
heineken
immediately
its
nice
and
light
but
still
keeps
a
grainy
flavor
not
much
for
head
though
almost
poured
more
like
a
soda
i
would
like
to
find
this
in
my
grocery
store
or
get
a
keg
of
it
for
home
drinking
this
straight
from
the
source
or
pretty
close
to
it
i
do
have
to
say
i
think
it
is
real
funny
that
most
chinese
poar
your
beer
into
either
a
wiskeyold
fashond
glass
or
a
highball
glass
there
is
no
head
nor
any
much
of
anything
but
the
taste
is
40
times
better
than
budwiser
and
it
has
never
mad
me
sick
unlike
budwiser
and
although
i
paid
a
full
90
cents
usd
for
my
pint
i
have
to
say
it
was
worth
it
this
beer
is
the
best
chinese
beer
that
i
have
incountered
i
will
post
if
there
is
any
better
local
beer
for
the
price
and
whithin
the
catagory
tsingtao
qing
dao
is
the
best
beer
you
can
get
and
i
would
recan
in
the
us
it
still
beats
most
american
shit
y
lagers
d
could
drink
a
lot
but
there
are
more
interesting
beers
out
there
d
well
please
avoid
it
drinkability
much
much
much
better
then
the
tsingtao
pure
draft
very
drinkable
and
great
for
the
warm
weather
months
d
nothting
special
here
at
all
seems
like
drinking
any
bud
or
miller
products
notes
it
has
its
own
unique
taste
unlike
any
other
macro
adjunct
lager
and
this
beer
stands
out
from
its
competition
not
to
mention
it
is
affordable
and
very
easy
to
drink
id
say
buy
this
beer
if
you
like
a
nice
smooth
lager
drinkability
its
cold
and
wet
with
a
complete
absence
of
character
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
semisweet
a
touch
dry
crisp
and
easy
drinking
value
overpriced
by
a
buck
or
two
per
sixer
if
you
ask
me
tsingtao
is
a
decent
drinker
but
only
a
half
step
up
from
miller
high
life
overall
nice
beer
that
goes
great
with
chinese
food
obviously
or
anything
a
bit
spicy
in
other
words
more
of
a
meal
beer
thumbs
up
drinkability
this
is
better
than
what
i
expected
from
it
if
you
have
it
cold
enough
its
pretty
decent
the
caveat
is
that
just
because
the
flavor
isnt
bad
doesnt
mean
its
good
there
is
absolutely
nothing
here
that
would
compel
me
to
ever
have
this
beer
again
i
do
travel
to
china
occassionally
though
and
this
is
good
enough
that
i
may
switch
it
up
in
place
of
the
licensed
local
brews
of
heineken
and
bud
i
say
give
it
a
shot
at
least
once
you
might
be
glad
you
did
not
too
bad
if
you
are
pairing
this
with
some
sushi
or
sashimi
thankfully
it
isnt
sweet
as
it
suggested
very
light
crisp
and
smooth
nothing
skunky
though
stored
in
a
green
bottle
also
the
grains
come
across
in
a
way
that
certainly
does
pair
well
with
spicy
or
fried
asian
foods
a
very
drinkable
though
not
quite
remarkable
brew
would
love
to
see
something
from
them
with
more
pizazz
drink
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
to
be
sure
probably
goes
well
with
most
dishes
at
your
favorite
asian
restaurant
straw
color
with
a
large
whit
head
with
poor
retention
faint
smell
of
grain
and
grass
tells
me
the
flavor
will
not
be
very
bold
not
much
taste
bland
with
some
light
sweet
malt
the
hop
flavor
is
pretty
weak
at
best
overall
a
pretty
weak
effort
not
recommended
dthe
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
not
a
fan
of
the
taste
there
is
a
lot
of
platic
and
phenol
in
the
taste
which
is
not
enjoyable
what
can
you
expect
from
an
adjuct
lager
the
nose
is
very
sweet
with
the
scent
typical
of
a
lager
but
with
a
dose
of
freshness
and
more
the
flavor
is
that
of
a
lager
but
the
taste
is
weak
but
it
is
quite
aromatic
there
are
touches
of
metal
but
also
with
subtle
touches
of
rice
the
finish
though
somewhat
artificial
is
slightly
bitter
and
is
touched
once
more
to
the
taste
of
rice
beer
fairly
low
in
terms
of
bitterness
and
flavor
but
is
very
pleasant
to
drink
which
contains
a
heady
force
very
well
hidden
indispensable
when
you
went
to
a
chinese
restaurant
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
a
slightly
sweet
grain
but
nothing
more
pretty
much
the
same
when
it
comes
to
taste
not
a
horrible
beer
but
nothing
good
at
the
same
time
probably
the
only
decent
selection
when
you
go
to
a
chinese
restaurant
anyway
but
even
then
i
would
just
get
the
tea
this
is
a
nice
import
lager
it
has
very
light
straw
colored
look
that
is
quite
carbonated
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
of
sweet
notes
the
taste
is
good
it
does
taste
of
grain
but
does
finish
with
some
nice
hop
notes
mouth
feel
is
about
medium
not
to
light
not
to
heavy
and
it
has
a
nice
drinkability
i
would
defintely
drink
this
beer
while
eating
some
general
tsos
chicken
light
but
not
so
bubbly
mouthfeel
slightly
flat
almost
not
the
smoothest
out
there
was
alright
with
my
chinease
meal
body
was
typical
for
this
style
but
due
to
the
skunk
factor
drinkability
was
far
less
than
it
should
have
been
overall
an
ok
beer
no
need
to
seek
it
out
but
if
you
see
it
why
not
give
it
a
shot
very
unimpressive
bland
beer
easy
to
drink
but
the
only
time
i
could
see
myself
having
another
would
be
for
cooling
off
on
a
scorching
hot
day
d
weak
flavor
and
underwhelming
body
to
not
bodewell
for
overall
drinkability
could
work
fine
as
a
lawnmower
beer
though
d
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
and
with
asian
being
my
favorite
cuisine
after
kirin
ichiban
or
sapporo
its
a
great
compliment
to
a
meal
of
spicy
chinese
d
on
its
own
this
is
not
an
overly
impressive
beer
however
it
is
quite
a
functional
beer
and
is
a
great
compliment
to
the
wide
array
of
flavors
present
in
a
chinese
meal
the
lightness
and
high
carbonation
are
able
to
cut
through
spice
grease
and
salt
giving
this
beer
a
great
cleansing
quality
reminds
me
of
heineken
just
a
bit
i
wont
be
drinking
this
anytime
soon
not
because
its
a
bad
beer
only
because
theres
better
beers
for
the
same
price
overall
for
the
largest
country
in
the
world
population
wise
you
think
they
could
come
up
with
better
beer
overall
a
less
than
decent
brew
but
stays
on
par
with
the
other
adjuncts
out
there
it
seems
like
its
only
good
for
washing
down
hot
foods
or
a
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
blond
straw
color
the
beer
poured
a
nice
white
head
that
was
pretty
the
smell
was
skunky
and
not
good
at
all
the
taste
was
not
skunky
but
was
green
and
sweet
tasting
the
beer
had
decent
lacing
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
mouthfeeldrink
average
level
light
bodied
watery
mouthfeel
smooth
to
drink
due
to
the
soft
cabonation
12oz
bottle
at
a
chinese
restaurant
golden
color
no
surprise
there
it
didnt
have
much
smell
in
the
glass
at
all
the
flavor
was
surprisingly
better
than
average
with
a
fruitiness
that
i
was
not
expecting
from
a
macro
chinese
lager
great
beer
to
pair
with
hot
and
sour
soup
drinkability
it
sure
is
an
easy
quaffer
and
the
taste
is
respectable
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
pretty
good
middle
of
the
road
beer
and
better
than
most
of
its
american
counterparts
decent
in
the
drinkability
department
went
through
it
very
quickly
much
better
than
the
red
oval
if
this
stuff
were
as
cheap
as
it
should
be
id
drink
it
as
it
is
ill
unfortunately
probably
never
drink
it
again
nice
brew
the
feel
is
a
little
less
watery
than
i
thought
but
its
drinkability
is
held
back
by
a
bitter
skunked
finsih
poured
a
clear
blonde
with
a
moderate
head
that
faded
to
nothing
the
aroma
was
straight
out
of
a
skunks
arse
but
after
i
became
desensitized
just
a
sweet
grain
aroma
the
taste
was
sweet
malty
grain
with
no
bite
hop
or
carbonation
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
almost
no
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
nothing
outstanding
here
your
basic
lager
very
sessionable
this
beer
poured
a
darker
yellow
with
a
singlefinger
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
good
old
capitalist
cooked
corn
just
like
weve
got
over
here
the
taste
follows
suit
starting
off
with
some
corn
that
gives
way
to
a
fairly
clean
finish
as
with
every
beer
in
this
style
the
highlight
is
drinkability
it
wouldnt
hurt
someone
to
have
one
every
so
often
but
it
hardly
seems
worth
importing
mediocrity
of
this
level
when
we
already
have
supermarkets
full
of
the
stuff
first
impression
of
this
beer
came
from
my
fatherinlaw
who
somehow
clung
to
this
brews
name
taking
his
typical
style
preference
into
account
stouts
i
figured
this
may
be
ok
for
an
aaj
either
i
was
completely
overhyped
or
a
whole
lot
of
people
1
3
billion
just
dont
have
any
other
options
overall
you
can
do
worse
in
the
category
than
this
beer
its
light
and
refreshing
inoffensive
and
the
flavour
is
mild
enough
that
you
can
pretty
much
ignore
it
i
wont
be
searching
it
out
but
maybe
next
time
im
eating
chinese
ill
see
if
they
have
this
available
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
color
was
darker
than
its
american
counterparts
small
head
that
didnt
laste
its
very
carbonated
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
and
the
taste
is
bitter
without
a
good
finish
or
flavor
to
even
it
out
i
dont
see
this
as
a
good
choice
for
any
occasion
and
i
will
avoid
it
in
the
futre
drinkability
drinkable
in
modest
amounts
a
good
second
or
third
string
beer
would
compliment
savory
foods
like
fajitas
or
sirloin
out
of
pilsners
i
rate
it
well
d
in
all
a
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
beer
considering
all
the
low
marks
this
is
probably
due
to
its
resemblance
to
carbonated
water
final
thoughts
well
let
me
start
by
saying
that
there
are
worse
beers
out
there
but
this
stuff
makes
other
adjunct
lagers
look
good
this
isnt
just
a
case
of
a
beer
being
bad
as
a
result
of
getting
skunked
as
the
only
qualities
behind
the
skunking
are
either
boring
or
out
of
place
maybe
it
would
be
good
with
chinese
food
but
thats
a
stretch
youll
want
to
avoid
this
offering
drinkability
not
the
worst
adjunct
lager
out
there
goes
great
with
chinese
food
and
is
pretty
refreshing
dont
look
for
much
in
the
way
of
taste
however
this
is
maybe
my
favorite
adjunct
lager
i
know
the
style
is
much
maligned
on
this
website
but
i
had
to
pick
this
one
up
for
a
review
its
a
clean
easy
going
sessionable
beer
that
i
think
is
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
good
light
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
unique
taste
that
makes
me
well
think
of
chinese
food
my
640ml
bottle
disappeared
relatively
quickly
overall
a
surprisingly
unique
beer
for
the
style
will
drink
this
again
for
sure
drinkability
its
not
bad
but
its
not
very
good
there
are
better
lagers
out
there
to
drink
overall
better
than
most
asian
macros
better
than
every
other
chinese
beer
ive
had
potable
but
not
worth
paying
top
dollar
for
in
a
chinese
restaurant
unless
youre
trying
to
prove
how
cosmopolitan
you
are
in
which
case
you
should
be
drinking
rice
spirit
anyway
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is

taste
is
fresh
with
hints
of
barley
and
malts
overall
very
refreshing
and
smooth
drinking
this
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
be
a
perfect
match
overall
a
good
beer
and
something
i
would
purchase
again
drinkability
easy
down
but
not
entirely
enjoyable
in
terms
of
complexity
would
be
good
to
pair
with
cuisine
but
not
in
its
own
right
this
is
not
all
that
bad
of
a
beer
but
should
be
relegated
to
washing
down
chinese
food
easy
to
throwback
goes
great
with
chinese
or
mongolian
food
probably
not
something
youd
drink
just
for
the
sake
of
drinking
though
overall
something
you
can
pound
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
what
i
would
choose
for
its
flavor
and
complexity

and
is
crisp
and
dry
overall
there
isnt
much
to
the
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
because
it
isnt
overwhelming
very
refreshing
actually
its
hard
to
imagine
anybody
not
wanting
one
of
these
on
a
hot
day
outside
or
like
me
right
now
inside
on
a
friday
night
decent
beer
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
though
good
while
waiting
on
my
food
though
the
first
illegal
i
had
at
an
actual
restaurant
at
ocean
city
more
than
a
decade
ago
this
one
is
going
to
be
more
professionally
sampled
straw
colored
almost
light
in
its
presentationan
effervescence
helps
offset
thinness
and
the
runny
weak
head
yeasty
bread
dominates
with
the
ping
of
saaz
hops
as
its
butteralmost
hints
that
something
is
amiss
presents
a
bland
blanket
of
smoothness
akin
to
water
to
the
mouth
with
little
early
or
late
that
suggests
this
is
a
beer
such
a
light
body
leads
to
an
almost
phantom
taste
a
pilsneresque
presence
minus
the
snap
of
eastern
european
brew
without
really
finding
blemish
tsing
tao
finishes
crisp
but
not
sharp
one
senses
rice
or
corn
int
he
tank
here
but
no
skunk
infiltrates
stays
balanced
throughout
the
22
oz
bottle
never
bitter
or
malty
despite
its
aroma
very
pale
beer
with
little
head
and
extremely
light
grainy
flavor
its
biased
a
bit
sweet
so
i
like
it
quite
drinkable
and
with
an
appropriately
clean
finish
no
noticeable
aftertaste
but
for
my
money
id
prefer
to
pay
less
with
something
like
pbr
very
pale
head
dissappears
really
fast
i
dont
really
like
the
smell
like
of
most
of
the
lager
beers
taste
is
very
clean
and
light
reminds
me
a
bit
of
those
german
reinheitsgebotbeers
its
refreshing
drinks
easily
and
no
bad
aftertaste
whatsoever
mostly
because
the
taste
dissapears
rapidly
its
a
simple
but
honest
brew
this
beer
went
flat
before
i
was
through
with
it
i
am
a
power
drinker
and
did
not
sip
this
beer
slowly
look
i
know
some
comments
are
inappropriate
but
as
a
well
educated
business
man
i
find
these
comments
to
not
be
outofline
when
i
say
this
beer
cut
corners
on
its
carbonation
it
is
typical
not
a
prejudice
but
a
known
fact
in
the
professional
business
world
and
far
into
the
mainstream
that
chinese
business
are
notorious
to
cut
corners
that
may
work
with
billion
chinese
population
but
in
america
we
are
subject
are
own
free
will
and
can
buy
another
beer
from
just
about
anywhere
in
the
world
i
had
to
knock
down
my
results
across
the
board
except
smell
by
0
5
served
in
a
green
bottle
at
one
of
our
fave
chinesejapanese
restaurants
pours
golden
to
amber
and
clear
aroma
is
grainy
mostly
clean
taste
is
sweet
almost
doughy
expecting
malt
or
corn
and
am
sensing
neither
unexpected
but
certainly
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavier
than
expected
finish
is
sweet
and
this
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
a
little
heavier
feeling
compared
to
many
of
its
type
it
did
however
compliment
my
sushi
rolls
quite
nicely
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
virtually
no
head
and
a
very
mild
aroma
i
didnt
expect
much
of
a
taste
but
it
was
actually
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
a
liitle
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
and
slight
aftertaste
feels
light
in
the
mouth
goes
down
smooth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
not
a
bad
beer
d
an
average
light
lager
decent
with
chinese
food
which
is
the
only
time
ive
ever
had
and
ever
will
have
this
beer
drinkability
is
alright
drinkability
just
another
forgettable
faceless
lager
from
china
that
makes
me
really
wish
i
had
some
chinese
grub
to
pair
with
it
mongolian
chicken
pork
lo
mein
moo
goo
gai
pan
bring
it
on
heck
ill
even
go
for
broccoli
beef
notes
it
states
that
this
is
chinas
finest
beer
well
with
that
said
i
can
add
that
it
was
certainly
not
even
close
to
a
bad
beeryet
i
feel
china
can
still
do
better
it
did
go
well
with
my
sushi
overall
simple
and
fresh
resulting
in
a
quite
acceptable
oriental
beer
nothing
special
but
better
than
an
average
macro
lager
nicely
drinkable
something
to
have
at
a
chinese
restaurant
but
thats
about
it
d
this
is
an
okay
lager
easy
drinking
but
lacks
a
lot
of
punch
in
the
flavor
department
looks
quite
lovely
when
poured
a
slightly
translucent
pale
yellow
with
a
fresh
white
head
the
head
disappears
in
seconds
though
not
much
of
anything
in
the
nose
though
creditable
for
its
genre
no
skunkish
odour
either
slightly
sweet
watery
taste
and
no
aftertaste
at
all
overall
an
unremarkable
but
not
foul
beer
pale
gold
in
color
with
large
bubbles
of
prickle
that
are
mildly
active
no
head
the
nose
is
very
some
macro
brews
like
moosehead
or
perhaps
heineken
but
i
believe
that
moosehead
is
the
match
there
are
some
grain
notes
faint
hoppiness
and
it
is
surprisingly
more
appealing
than
i
had
expected
my
expectations
were
pretty
low
the
attack
is
consistent
with
the
nose
lots
of
grain
and
faint
hops
that
reads
as
somewhat
sour
notes
very
light
body
and
mouthfeel
prickly
aftertaste
that
dries
in
the
mouth
it
is
amazing
how
much
it
resembles
premium
beers
from
this
country
but
manages
to
be
drinkable
not
really
offensive
in
any
way
but
not
particularly
good
either
overall
this
is
something
i
would
never
want
to
get
again
i
would
rather
have
an
american
macro
lager
over
this
not
my
style
and
not
something
id
ever
recommend
drinkability
very
drinkable
though
not
very
desirable
drinkability
the
sweetness
makes
this
a
mediocre
lager
d
goes
with
chinese
food
decently
as
it
can
wash
down
even
the
spiciest
and
most
flavorful
of
dishes
however
theres
not
much
of
a
point
to
drinking
it
by
itself
or
buying
it
for
any
other
occasion
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
that
you
could
drink
throughout
the
day
i
enjoyed
in
both
bottle
form
at
parties
and
while
walking
around
epcot
center
it
pours
up
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
decent
lacing
at
first
the
nose
is
pale
grains
bready
oily
textured
aroma
subtle
sweet
malts
i
taste
the
exact
same
as
the
nose
with
subtle
sweet
malts
bread
pale
grains
very
buttery
texture
light
to
med
bodied
med
carbo
a
pretty
clean
lager
in
short
the
meal
in
the
restaurants
is
always
better
with
a
beer
than
without
but
this
beer
is
pretty
mediocre
final
thoughts
i
was
curious
about
chinese
beer
i
tried
this
one
and
was
wasnt
impressed
it
is
your
typical
macro
european
lager
style
nothing
terrible
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
the
price
tag
hurts
this
one
a
bit
as
it
runs
9
for
a
six
i
grabbed
the
24
oz
bottle
for
roughly
3
which
gave
me
the
chance
to
try
it
without
going
crazy
my
friend
has
tried
it
in
china
and
they
she
says
it
isnt
really
any
different
bonus
points
do
go
to
the
brewery
for
giving
it
to
you
in
a
plastic
bag
of
sorts
overall
this
is
palate
washer
nothing
id
ever
seek
in
a
six
but
at
a
chinese
restaurant
worth
drinking
with
the
cuisine
appearance
aside
i
am
seriously
impressed
by
this
chinese
lager
i
expected
it
to
be
bad
which
it
was
far
from
not
terrible
but
i
would
never
buy
this
again
d
very
high
not
bad
for
an
adjunct
lager
not
bad
at
all
i
would
say
its
better
than
most
other
offerings
still
not
really
a
reason
to
drink
this
unless
your
chinese
there
are
better
offerings
of
the
same
style
for
less
money
nikki
its
drinkable
easy
to
have
a
few
though
its
not
a
beer
id
get
excited
about
it
did
however
go
very
well
with
the
chinese
food
so
i
may
consider
it
again
in
that
situation
this
is
an
extremely
watery
thin
brew
im
sure
this
aids
the
drinkability
but
i
dont
like
this
all
im
tasting
is
the
adjuntness
tastes
fake
some
thin
vegetable
flavors
very
weak
beer
avoid
paired
this
with
a
nice
meal
at
a
chinese
restaurant
and
found
the
beer
to
be
a
huge
distraction
i
should
have
stuck
with
a
glass
of
water
carbonation
was
lower
than
i
expected
which
was
fine
i
would
have
liked
a
cleaner
finish
but
i
had
no
problems
cracking
open
a
second
bottle
drinkability
looks
pretty
funny
but
outside
of
that
there
are
no
complaints
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
asian
beers
i
have
had
thus
far
out
of
a
mixed
sixer
i
made
from
the
restaurant
i
worked
at
i
picked
out
sapporo
kirin
ichiban
kirin
light
asahi
budweiser
and
this
this
would
definitely
go
well
with
chinese
food
or
sushi
maybe
even
your
typical
american
bbq
overall
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
however
popular
it
may
be
in
chinahong
kong
it
is
a
weak
excuse
for
a
lager
uncharacteristic
bland
not
worth
the
money
once
in
a
lifetime
but
i
wouldnt
bother
had
this
in
hong
kong
reviewed
from
notes
taste
falls
off
from
the
nose
flavor
is
only
slightly
malty
with
a
bit
of
sulfur
taste
back
there
as
well
hops
dont
really
come
through
but
an
astringent
dry
aftertaste
does
hey
maybe
thats
lead
mouthfeel
is
light
and
overall
this
beer
a
low
degree
of
drinkability
only
23
more
to
go
i
picked
up
this
beer
on
sale
from
the
lcbo
pours
out
a
light
yellow
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
at
all
looks
decent
for
what
it
is
smells
like
all
other
macros
do
but
i
will
give
it
a
3
for
no
skunky
smells
like
many
imports
have
this
has
a
decent
taste
goes
down
like
water
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
not
much
else
for
a
light
lager
it
has
a
lot
more
taste
than
most
of
its
more
popular
counter
parts
coors
lightbud
light
etc
decent
also
has
a
much
better
mouthfeel
than
most
other
light
beers
nice
and
full
with
good
carbonation
i
gave
this
a
perfect
score
for
drinkability
because
since
it
goes
down
so
easily
you
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
goes
well
with
spicy
food
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
is
a
light
beer
that
actually
goes
well
with
spicy
food
to
drink
in
alone
as
a
session
beer
this
gets
boring
very
quickly
this
has
a
touch
more
flavor
than
some
others
in
the
style
for
me
this
is
a
situational
beer
yum
cha
for
sunday
lunch
wouldnt
be
the
same
without
a
couple
of
bottles
if
you
are
comparing
this
like
you
should
to
other
macro
lagers
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
do
not
be
affraid
d
good
with
a
refreshing
feeling
this
beer
was
sadly
bland
and
wannabe
grainy
in
an
entirely
noninspiring
way
i
drank
this
from
a
bottle
with
a
few
friends
for
the
first
time
a
few
days
ago
at
a
korean
restaurant
and
was
not
at
all
impressed
with
the
meek
color
and
watereddown
taste
despite
its
semi
yellow
color
which
looks
like
it
was
added
the
finish
is
overcarbonated
and
particularly
did
not
pair
well
with
the
korean
dishes
i
was
eating
it
with
drinkability
i
wouldnt
say
know
to
a
free
one
but
not
something
id
ever
purchase
not
off
flavour
other
then
overly
sweet
d
ive
had
this
many
times
with
chinese
food
it
is
a
nice
compliment
to
that
cuisine
as
a
stand
alone
beer
however
it
doesnt
do
much
for
me
pours
a
body
that
is
a
pale
golden
color
looks
like
domestic
fizzy
with
a
white
head
quickly
diminishing
has
a
sweet
aroma
has
a
sweet
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
and
lively
very
bland
flavor
d
this
is
my
first
chinese
beer
and
not
bad
i
would
drink
this
over
many
domestic
macro
lagers
but
still
not
a
top
vote
this
is
far
more
tasty
and
interesting
than
tsingtao
pure
draft
so
do
not
get
these
confused
as
a
couple
others
have
said
this
is
by
no
means
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
however
it
had
a
couple
qualities
i
really
enjoyed
its
an
excellent
beer
to
pair
with
chinese
or
any
type
of
food
really
probably
a
chicken
and
veggie
or
lighter
meal
also
it
had
an
extremely
light
almost
sweet
taste
to
it
sort
of
like
a
snow
pea
if
you
can
imagine
that
taste
in
a
beer
certainly
not
a
filling
beer
by
any
means
so
it
would
be
good
if
youre
looking
for
something
you
can
have
a
few
of
in
an
evening
as
for
negatives
at
first
i
wasnt
to
pleased
with
the
smell
its
got
a
skunky
aroma
initially
after
it
breathes
for
a
minute
or
two
that
goes
away
overall
it
was
a
win
in
my
book
its
always
at
my
local
hyvee
supermarket
and
its
one
ill
certainly
give
another
go
d
this
is
simply
not
a
good
beer
what
taste
there
is
evident
is
pungent
and
undrinkable
pass
paired
with
spicy
chicken
and
string
beans
great
combination
with
chinese
food
a
smooth
light
and
crisp
beer
not
too
much
more
to
say
the
texture
was
almost
like
water
the
carbonation
got
in
the
way
a
little
sort
of
stung
my
tongue
but
it
was
still
good
on
a
second
occasion
i
had
it
when
i
was
dehydrated
and
in
desperate
need
of
a
drink
and
it
went
down
just
as
well
the
first
time
i
would
say
its
not
a
good
sipping
beer
though
when
it
got
the
slightest
bit
warm
it
became
a
little
less
flavorful
ok
this
is
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
has
quite
a
few
pros
this
beer
is
intended
to
be
consumed
with
food
if
you
want
to
have
chinese
food
with
a
light
drink
then
this
one
is
just
what
you
are
looking
for
it
goes
perfectly
its
a
typical
lager
crystalclear
blonde
discreet
taste
and
weak
aroma
i
usually
dont
drink
lager
beers
but
this
one
i
can
have
by
the
barrels
while
theres
food
on
the
table
i
wouldnt
drink
it
alone
though
this
beer
is
what
you
want
to
drink
when
you
dont
want
to
drink
eating
kung
pao
i
had
to
have
a
liquid
supplement
so
i
ordered
one
of
these
out
of
a
bottle
the
glass
was
delivered
to
my
table
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
head
retained
itself
pretty
well
but
there
was
little
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
of
a
typical
macrolager
lager
malt
and
corn
mash
with
some
skunked
quality
the
flavors
were
a
little
better
light
dry
grains
malt
and
corn
with
some
huskiness
then
a
bit
of
citrus
rind
but
the
finish
was
metallic
reminded
me
of
bad
iced
tea
the
mouthfeel
however
was
light
and
crisp
and
it
did
help
to
wash
down
the
food
however
with
that
said
i
could
only
imagine
ordering
it
at
a
asian
restaurant
when
i
had
no
other
alternatives
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
that
is
clear
has
a
decent
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
not
collaring
or
laciness
very
skunky
aroma
bringing
the
glass
to
the
nose
gave
subtle
hints
of
cereal
grains
taste
was
all
skunk
and
cereal
grains
moderate
aftertaste
light
and
thin
on
the
tongue
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
for
being
a
skunky
beer
it
was
not
terrible
went
down
like
water
not
recommended
i
could
see
this
being
strictly
an
accompanying
drink
for
chinese
food
or
other
asian
cuisine
outside
of
that
i
couldnt
give
it
high
marks
in
any
category
d
a
big
pass
here
finishable
but
not
by
much
with
a
less
then
enjoyable
fun
factor
going
down
a
friend
of
mine
brought
over
some
tsingtao
imported
from
china
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
wispy
head
light
in
the
aroma
but
some
lager
malt
does
register
in
the
nose
fairly
crisp
clean
and
light
on
the
palate
the
beer
presents
mainly
grainy
and
bready
flavors
and
finishes
with
a
light
snap
of
bitterness
this
beer
isnt
too
shabby
considering
the
cringes
the
style
american
macro
lager
invokes
in
some
folks
keep
an
open
mind
and
enjoy
chinas
number
one
beer
was
the
only
option
i
had
at
a
chinese
restaurant
once
and
it
actually
wasnt
too
bad
maybe
because
i
thought
id
hate
it
or
the
chinese
food
masked
the
flavor
hay
sweet
malt
taste
slight
trace
of
bitterness
id
get
it
again
in
the
same
situation
but
i
wont
go
looking
for
it
i
have
heard
of
it
being
skunky
which
mine
wasnt
d
i
will
be
using
this
beer
to
hydrate
from
other
beers
the
wife
and
i
were
at
an
asian
place
having
dinner
on
saturday
and
the
olympics
were
on
to
salute
the
games
i
ordered
a
tsingtao
what
a
mistake
poured
into
a
beer
glass
bright
yellow
body
fizzy
yellow
color
and
a
white
head
that
took
a
heavy
pour
to
form
smelled
like
all
macros
do
tasted
like
old
apple
juice
or
maybe
stale
iced
tea
gross
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
stay
away
d
definitely
drinkable
a
little
too
expensive
to
buy
all
the
time
but
one
of
the
better
oriental
lagers
that
ive
had
this
one
is
a
good
choice
for
spicy
foods
of
all
kinds
not
just
chinese
if
you
must
go
eat
chinese
you
really
cant
go
wrong
drinking
this
it
did
help
to
put
the
fire
out
nicely
overall
a
fairly
enjoyable
imported
lager
i
would
recommend
it
to
someone
looking
for
what
it
is
however
if
this
is
not
your
fancy
its
not
so
great
as
to
be
worth
gong
way
out
of
your
way
just
to
get
one
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
my
first
beer
from
china
taste
is
quite
neutral
slightly
malty
and
also
maybe
a
bit
too
watery
carbonation
moderate
it
goes
down
very
quickly
and
is
quite
refreshing
i
liked
it
would
have
it
again
even
though
its
definately
not
my
favorite
lager
notes
overall
its
a
very
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
modest
light
flavor
average
it
pours
out
a
rather
typical
straw
yellow
not
impressive
but
the
white
head
is
thick
and
fluffy
and
hangs
around
for
a
bit
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
typical
for
a
lager
flavor
is
malty
with
a
surprising
hint
of
fruit
making
it
better
than
most
macrobrew
lagers
texture
is
smooth
and
pleasant
not
outstanding
but
ok
good
as
a
companion
to
a
meal
i
have
never
run
into
an
asian
beer
i
dont
like
tsing
tao
reminds
me
of
a
weaker
version
of
peroni
this
beer
i
believe
is
best
enjoyed
in
the
afternoon
while
being
lazy
or
just
finishing
a
big
project
and
want
to
cool
off
not
bad
and
i
always
enjoy
this
one
not
bad
its
ostensibly
a
pilsnerstyle
beer
very
light
and
crisp
with
flavors
of
malt
and
rice
but
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
flavorwise
typical
macro
lager
not
worth
it
for
its
own
merits
but
about
right
if
you
just
need
to
wash
down
some
inexpensive
spicy
food
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pale
muted
gold
color
an
aggressive
pour
left
it
with
an
inch
of
head
quickly
dissipated
to
almost
nothing
and
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
nose
the
smallest
hint
of
malts
simple
taste
of
just
beer
uninteresting
but
drinkable
lightly
carbonated
and
very
light
on
the
palate
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
definitely
the
most
common
beer
in
chinese
restaurants
and
i
dont
mind
ordering
one
good
beer
where
you
least
expect
it
if
i
drank
this
with
some
mushi
pork
id
be
a
happy
man
repeat
buy
it
certainly
is
spot
on
for
the
style
great
beer
to
enjoy
with
chinese
food
or
sushi
doesnt
fill
you
up
i
must
say
i
wasnt
expecting
much
when
i
ordered
this
one
at
a
restaurant
in
bostons
chinatown
but
its
surprisingly
good
who
would
have
thought
the
chinese
brewed
good
beer
go
figure
it
makes
more
sense
now
upon
learning
that
tsingtao
was
a
german
possession
in
the
1900s
the
beer
itself
is
refreshing
and
bizarrely
lighttasting
for
a
regular
beer
but
in
an
inoffensive
sort
of
way
its
a
bit
cloying
has
some
malt
sweetness
and
faint
hops
decent
brew
all
around
ab
owns
20ish
of
the
company
thoughts
apparantly
equivalent
to
the
chinese
budweiser
i
think
the
china
man
macro
is
alittle
better
than
the
american
counterparts
but
overall
not
too
impressive
does
well
for
its
category
just
not
my
favorite
style
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
as
far
as
macros
go
this
one
is
top
notch
session
last
night
in
manhattan
i
had
a
bottle
with
dinner
and
decided
it
was
time
to
review
the
beer
looks
like
any
macro
lager
clear
straw
color
with
a
sufficient
white
foam
the
aroma
and
taste
are
neutral
easier
to
detect
hops
bitterness
than
malt
sweetness
but
either
way
muted
just
a
refreshing
drink
to
try
to
wash
away
the
burn
of
spicy
peppers
ive
found
coating
my
tongue
in
rice
helps
more
d
if
it
had
any
sort
of
taste
i
would
have
rated
this
one
higher
frankly
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
one
of
these
again
its
little
more
than
a
notch
on
my
beer
glass
the
beer
was
golden
yellow
with
a
pitiful
head
of
a
few
white
bubbles
the
smell
was
pretty
grassy
and
the
taste
was
average
in
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
lite
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
it
was
a
beer
that
went
down
pretty
easy
but
had
nothing
to
make
it
very
special
going
for
it
good
if
you
want
a
lighter
beer
i
guess
smell
is
skunky
at
first
but
becomes
more
grain
like
after
a
few
out
of
green
bottle
taste
is
pleasant
a
lot
better
than
i
had
expected
light
malts
and
grain
not
to
bitter
but
a
bit
sweet
body
is
very
light
and
bubbles
are
present
but
not
obnoxious
finish
is
decent
with
little
aftertaste
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
is
okay
has
a
nice
crisp
bite
that
makes
it
mildly
interesting
goes
down
easy
enough
but
drinkability
is
severely
limited
due
to
its
blandness
overall
its
not
a
good
beer
not
something
id
seek
out
taste
saves
this
beer
from
utter
desolation
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
hops
on
the
mid
palate
but
by
mid
im
talking
in
terms
of
timing
from
the
first
sip
to
the
afterglow
of
the
back
palate
not
in
terms
of
the
actual
progression
of
taste
from
the
first
sip
to
the
afterglow
of
the
back
palate
since
there
is
actually
no
real
taste
the
hops
though
tell
me
that
i
am
definitely
drinking
beer
apart
from
that
theres
a
slight
cloying
character
to
the
mouthfeel
which
is
very
unpleasant
overall
very
very
little
character
or
anything
to
this
beer
its
bland
and
pretty
unappealing
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
light
straw
color
forming
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
skunky
mix
of
light
hops
and
grain
the
taste
is
very
bland
consisting
of
light
hops
and
alot
of
grain
clean
light
mouthfeel
as
far
as
drinkability
if
you
like
a
flavorless
light
beer
then
i
suppose
this
is
your
beer
for
me
this
beer
was
no
better
than
drinking
a
warm
bud
light
sorry
mouthfeeldrinkabilitymy
brotherin
law
brought
this
for
me
fron
china
and
if
i
ever
go
there
i
will
drink
this
and
the
other
brands
i
have
tried
this
over
here
and
it
didnt
taste
like
this
this
is
a
crisp
beer
you
should
try
enjoy
taste
is
light
and
crisp
but
has
a
horrible
aftertaste
not
so
dissimilar
from
a
typical
macro
lager
bit
more
skunk
though
this
beer
poured
a
nearly
clear
pale
gold
into
the
glass
with
a
thick
head
that
dissappeared
almost
instantaneously
it
left
no
lacing
it
smells
strongly
of
white
bread
and
is
equally
tasteless
it
is
bubbly
and
carbonated
when
you
first
sip
giving
it
a
lightbodied
feel
and
fairly
dulltasting
as
it
reaches
the
back
of
your
mouth
it
leaves
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
there
is
nothing
particularly
noteworthy
about
this
beer
it
is
comparable
to
a
bud
or
coors
d
this
one
is
flavorful
for
the
style
goes
down
easy
overall
comes
across
as
average
though
d
this
beer
goes
very
well
with
asian
cuisine
whether
it
be
general
tsos
chicken
or
sushi
tsingtao
is
always
an
excellent
complement
to
your
plate
but
outside
of
those
avenues
i
do
not
drink
it
bought
this
at
my
local
chinese
restaurant
just
to
say
i
drank
it
i
should
have
known
better
i
was
scared
the
minute
i
saw
a
light
green
bottle
this
usually
means
skunk
it
did
taste
fresh
but
taste
is
minimal
difficult
to
get
a
head
during
the
pour
and
goes
away
about
as
fast
as
you
pour
the
beer
clear
pale
yellow
taste
was
kind
of
malty
not
much
to
say
really
boring
ranks
up
there
with
our
macros
but
less
flavor
light
bodied
and
quite
smooth
goes
down
easy
and
actually
didnt
taste
too
bad
with
some
spicey
homemade
eggrolls
certainly
tastes
better
than
bud
ot
the
likes
12oz
brown
bottle
with
a
freshness
date
of
52308
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
1
finger
head
poor
longevity
and
poor
lace
slight
honey
malt
aromas
with
a
touch
of
citrus
this
stuff
is
pretty
watery
even
as
macros
go
some
honey
and
malt
tastes
with
a
small
bit
of
bitterness
its
crisp
light
and
easy
drinking
but
just
a
bit
too
watery
even
for
a
macro
still
if
youre
seeking
a
common
asian
lager
id
go
with
33
singha
or
even
one
of
the
japanese
rice
brews
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
amazingly
not
unduly
overly
carbonated
very
light
on
the
palate
aroma
and
taste
are
the
same
you
could
technically
say
well
balanced
but
that
is
just
because
there
is
really
no
bitterness
or
sweet
maltiness
there
is
a
faint
beeralcohol
note
somewhere
and
perhaps
some
rice
but
maybe
it
is
me
looking
for
something
not
bad
for
a
macro
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
and
besides
im
trying
to
boycott
all
things
from
the
peoples
repub
so
i
wont
be
having
another
anytime
soon
drinkability
bière
pils
correcte
light
straw
color
and
very
clear
with
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
running
around
the
flavor
in
this
one
is
relatively
light
so
there
isnt
much
to
talk
about
the
only
thing
i
can
add
is
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
brew
but
i
should
note
the
flavor
gets
better
when
it
warms
up
it
probably
hits
the
spot
when
eating
an
array
of
chinese
dishes
but
as
a
session
brew
theres
better
for
less
money
poured
out
an
average
straw
color
very
little
head
and
pretty
much
no
lacing
while
it
doesnt
have
a
bad
smell
it
borders
just
this
side
of
skunky
it
has
a
very
flat
and
bland
taste
nothing
worthy
of
note
and
nothing
that
stuck
out
goes
down
fine
as
it
is
but
dont
expect
much
pours
out
a
still
straw
color
with
a
thin
meager
head
lots
of
sulfur
and
dms
in
the
aroma
some
malt
and
graininess
underneath
the
defects
taste
is
rather
grainy
with
more
of
the
sulfury
and
vegetal
notes
coming
out
has
a
bit
of
hops
towards
the
end
the
finish
is
kind
of
harsh
drying
and
tannic
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
but
not
too
light
not
for
me
this
one
didnt
get
reviewed
the
first
time
cause
of
a
bad
batchcomes
in
a
green
bottle
and
it
was
completely
flatno
fizz
no
head
nothing
turned
me
off
but
here
i
am
trying
it
againand
this
time
i
got
a
decent
batch
pours
a
clear
light
golden
yellow
with
nice
size
bubbly
white
head
with
fair
retention
and
minimal
lacing
nose
is
skunk
upon
first
whiff
which
goes
away
and
than
its
musty
grains
and
grass
with
a
sulfitio
whiff
to
it
taste
is
sulfurywith
lite
tangy
bitterness
to
it
with
a
faint
sweetness
comming
thru
and
kinda
watery
flat
finish
not
much
therealmost
like
drinking
coors
lite
with
a
little
more
tang
and
sulfuric
taste
very
lite
mouthfeel
to
this
one
and
watery
feel
going
down
i
think
id
rather
drink
busch
or
mgd
at
a
cheaper
price
this
one
didnt
do
anything
for
me
im
stuck
in
china
for
the
time
being
so
stuff
like
this
is
pretty
much
the
standard
though
i
suppose
you
could
do
worse
it
tastes
not
like
much
of
anything
very
thin
watery
and
slightly
sweet
it
finishes
clean
with
no
aftertaste
not
much
point
in
drinking
this
because
if
i
want
an
american
macro
lager
i
could
buy
something
a
heck
a
lot
cheaper
with
more
taste
d
very
easy
to
drink
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
lots
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
also
good
when
you
want
to
have
a
beer
with
your
meal
that
wont
overpower
what
your
eating
and
leaves
your
mouth
refreshed
to
eat
more
food
or
just
as
easily
take
another
drink
not
too
heavy
so
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
probably
better
than
i
anticipated
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
a
six
but
certainly
enjoyable
in
my
setting
with
szechuan
spicy
beef
and
crab
rangoon
d
pretty
damn
good
reminds
me
of
a
malt
liquor
since
its
really
heavy
with
creamed
corn
adjuncts
assertively
boozy
and
really
sweet
i
would
drink
this
again
in
a
pinch
i
tried
this
beer
on
august
8
2007
at
a
korean
grill
restaurant
queenuniversity
location
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
a
golden
yellow
into
the
glass
with
no
head
there
was
no
aroma
to
speak
of
i
even
had
my
partner
smell
the
beer
and
she
couldnt
smell
anything
either
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
mild
carbonation
the
taste
was
slightly
malty
with
a
dry
finish
tsingtao
is
basically
like
a
chinese
macro
similar
to
budweiser
which
is
no
surprise
since
anheuser
owns
about
a
quarter
of
the
chinese
brewery
tsingtao
has
very
little
taste
or
smell
its
drinkable
enough
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
its
a
very
clear
pour
with
little
head
or
lacing
the
taste
was
nothing
special
very
watery
i
was
not
impressed
but
its
not
so
horrendous
that
i
wouldnt
drink
it
if
it
was
all
that
was
available
edit
1207
after
having
another
meal
of
chinese
short
ribs
a
couple
of
these
went
along
well
it
wasnt
as
skunky
but
that
biscuity
sweetness
was
there
it
reminded
me
of
a
pilsner
ive
had
this
beer
for
years
whenever
i
went
to
any
good
chinese
restaurant
that
served
tsingtao
on
a
recent
trip
to
china
this
became
my
mainstay
as
one
traveling
companion
noted
this
is
the
heineken
of
china
and
i
guess
that
is
about
as
spot
on
an
assessment
as
any
i
could
come
up
with
the
beer
is
pretty
good
but
not
exceptional
the
pour
is
slightly
frothy
with
not
much
lacing
and
a
quickly
dissipating
head
the
color
is
lightish
yellow
reasonably
carbonated
but
not
overly
so
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
reasonably
well
balanced
hops
vs
malt
but
you
arent
going
to
get
either
in
spades
so
the
term
well
balanced
needs
some
qualification
here
the
taste
is
a
bit
straw
a
bit
grassy
and
with
just
enough
hop
bite
to
let
you
know
there
is
some
substance
to
the
beer
there
is
a
bit
of
a
yeast
fizziness
to
this
beer
as
well
and
that
is
an
added
plus
tsingtao
goes
down
easy
leaves
very
little
after
taste
has
a
tinge
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
has
a
very
light
mouthtaste
that
does
clean
the
palate
when
eating
your
favorite
chinese
food
i
believe
the
tsingtao
in
china
is
fresher
and
noticably
better
in
china
than
over
here
lchaim
pours
like
your
typical
lager
fizzy
and
yellow
smell
has
some
florals
in
it
along
with
sweet
malt
light
grassy
tones
with
a
backing
of
hay
and
light
pomegranate
taste
is
crisp
and
a
bit
grainy
with
a
hint
of
hop
flavoring
the
flavor
is
never
predominantly
much
of
anything
just
a
nice
crisp
clean
flavor
which
makes
this
an
easy
beer
to
drink
especially
with
some
nice
spicy
shrimp
or
any
other
hot
chinese
cuisine
d
easy
to
drink
washed
down
my
chinese
takeout
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
outside
of
a
chinese
restaurant
d
not
terrible
but
not
very
good
and
boring
i
may
have
another
in
the
next
chinese
place
if
its
the
only
alternative
to
bmc
and
im
desperate
nice
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
held
to
a
quarter
inch
then
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
with
some
lacing
light
aromas
of
malt
and
yeast
taste
of
sweet
malt
and
yeast
with
a
grainy
slight
hop
finish
medium
body
crisp
lots
of
carbonation
slightly
different
from
the
run
of
the
mill
macro
lager
pretty
enjoyable
beer
good
for
summer
fare
overall
a
pretty
good
and
drinkable
lager
certainly
superior
to
the
bmc
grouping
ddespite
the
skunk
aroma
this
goes
well
with
some
salt
and
pepper
squid
and
red
vinegar
the
carbonation
cuts
through
everything
still
this
in
no
way
a
good
beer
fairly
refreshing
on
the
palate
good
for
thirst
quenching
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
an
underlying
slight
skunk
despite
the
freshness
of
the
bottle
that
makes
this
a
withspicyfoodonly
kind
of
beer
not
as
crisp
and
dry
as
one
would
like
there
are
certainly
better
options
in
this
category
beer
poured
out
fine
for
a
macro
lager
mild
carbonation
mild
head
a
deeper
golden
color
than
many
lagers
smell
as
others
have
said
bad
after
i
poured
the
beer
i
could
smell
it
from
about
two
feet
away
and
it
didnt
smell
good
after
a
few
drinks
i
could
not
even
smell
the
beer
with
my
nose
in
the
glass
taste
was
flat
and
a
bit
skunky
for
me
mouthfeel
very
light
very
flat
seemingly
no
carbonation
all
in
all
a
pretty
bad
experience
almost
as
if
the
beer
was
on
its
last
breath
and
just
flat
out
died
2
seconds
after
entering
the
glass
tsingtao
was
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
the
head
quickly
dissapated
to
a
thin
ring
with
very
little
lace
the
smell
was
light
grain
and
a
hint
of
skunk
the
taste
was
light
grainy
and
somewhat
harsh
the
finish
was
dry
it
was
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonantion
drinkability
was
below
average
due
to
the
taste
save
your
money
and
your
tastebuds
and
skip
this
one
d
easy
to
drink
but
the
smell
makes
you
not
want
to
drink
it
salud
d
i
didnt
find
it
tasty
at
all
and
had
a
hard
time
finishing
it
its
slightly
filling
for
the
style
my
fatherinlaw
loves
this
stuff
but
i
cant
understand
why
overall
its
decent
better
than
the
typical
american
macro
certainly
one
ill
order
next
time
im
out
for
chinese
i
have
a
hunch
it
will
complement
a
spicy
dish
quite
well
an
aboveaverage
macro
lager
not
too
bad
its
al
little
heavy
and
sweet
but
i
can
see
this
one
being
a
life
saver
paired
with
some
flaming
sichuan
d
very
average
for
the
style
inoffensive
and
very
refreshing
especially
with
a
hottish
chinese
dish
would
not
touch
it
outside
of
a
chinese
eatery
drinkability
what
can
i
say
its
refreshing
tasteless
maybe
ill
give
this
another
go
when
im
having
some
chinese
ill
chug
the
rest
overall
decent
if
you
drink
it
very
cold
typical
for
the
style
decent
session
beer
if
your
only
other
choice
was
a
bud
mouthfeel
a
nice
carbonation
bite
lingering
sweetness
with
just
the
faintest
sense
of
hop
bitterness
biting
light
a
bit
watery
but
crisp
this
pours
a
light
transparent
straw
hue
with
a
white
head
and
little
retention
at
all
the
aroma
is
rather
standard
for
american
macro
lagers
with
a
bit
of
hops
and
mail
to
it
the
taste
is
a
bit
malty
with
some
bitter
hops
its
a
subtle
yet
pleasant
taste
its
has
a
nice
balanced
feel
a
bit
more
to
it
that
usual
and
it
drinks
well
with
chinese
food
nice
carbonation
and
its
rather
drinkable
balancing
out
chilies
and
spices
in
a
good
chinese
meal
no
aroma
and
no
taste
rice
maybe
my
tastebuds
had
a
laugh
with
me
i
thought
it
was
sweet
at
first
then
a
heavy
dryness
appeared
and
is
all
i
can
comment
on
it
does
stay
dry
in
the
mouth
but
it
is
not
a
beer
i
could
recommend
even
with
a
curry
drinkablity
nice
easy
drinking
beer
good
on
warm
days
and
with
any
kind
of
oriental
food
not
a
type
i
would
normally
drink
this
offering
had
no
head
or
lacing
color
was
the
palest
of
yellow
aroma
was
that
of
a
rice
lager
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
and
fizzy
slightly
resinous
palate
crisp
light
taste
quite
nice
for
a
lager
actually
id
revisit
this
one
especially
if
i
were
out
to
retire
some
replicants
drinkablity
very
easy
to
drink
good
with
spicy
food
i
would
recommend
it
really
bland
taste
however
adjunct
pale
malts
nothing
to
get
excited
about
overall
quite
drinkable
but
not
anything
id
feel
compelled
to
have
again
the
smell
is
faint
some
pale
malt
comes
through
but
not
much
theres
a
little
more
flavor
in
the
taste
but
not
by
much
what
flavor
is
there
is
a
plain
mix
of
grains
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
sharp
while
drinkability
is
decent
drank
pretty
easy
certainally
a
cut
above
bmc
went
well
with
the
sushi
the
2
12
oz
bottles
went
down
easy
a
fairly
average
lager
in
all
respects
light
in
colour
and
lost
the
head
fairly
quickly
not
too
much
to
say
about
the
smell
taste
was
pleasant
enough
slightly
bitter
at
first
but
sweet
and
crisp
through
the
aftertaste
reasonably
light
carbonation
gives
a
pleasant
tingling
wihtout
being
overpowering
goes
very
nicely
with
chinese
food
or
heavy
curries
but
probably
not
worth
drinking
by
itself
unless
you
really
want
to
try
it
that
way
yellow
bubbly
pour
smells
of
grains
and
hops
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
up
front
with
sweetness
to
follow
that
continues
into
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
carbonated
side
but
mellowed
with
sweetness
drinkable
but
not
a
first
choice
hard
to
come
up
with
much
good
about
this
basically
a
typical
asian
beer
in
the
same
class
with
singha
kirin
etc
very
light
lager
with
virtually
no
head
or
lacing
strong
aroma
of
grain
and
more
if
this
in
the
taste
and
finish
not
much
to
write
home
about
on
this
one
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappates
quickly
leaving
no
evidence
that
it
was
even
there
no
aroma
that
truely
stands
out
biscuity
and
malt
aromas
with
a
slight
scent
of
hops
at
the
end
the
taste
of
biscuit
is
there
and
not
much
else
it
is
light
to
medium
bodied
coats
the
palate
but
the
carbonation
is
very
strong
the
chinese
macro
lager
is
not
very
impressive
just
ordinary
yellow
and
fizzy
stuff
i
guess
this
is
what
id
imagine
a
sinomacro
lager
to
be
and
thats
just
a
reflection
not
a
recommendation
it
has
some
fair
flavor
and
ive
had
it
with
chinese
food
an
actually
willing
companion
but
on
its
own
its
thin
and
a
challenge
to
latch
onto
its
pretty
drinakable
but
the
billions
in
china
are
welcome
to
as
much
as
they
want
to
drink
i
like
the
food
but
not
so
much
the
beer
its
perfectly
fine
for
a
basic
mass
produced
lager
if
thats
your
thing
and
its
on
sale
id
say
drink
it
but
its
not
for
me
drinkability

at
about
50
us
for
a
600ml
keep
them
coming
at
pace
with
the
lamb
kebobs
i
hope
this
isnt
the
finest
beer
in
china
as
the
label
states
a
sample
like
this
poorly
serves
the
reputation
of
such
a
majestic
nation
overall
a
decent
easy
drinking
macro
that
goes
well
with
chinese
and
other
heavily
spiced
foods
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
that
produces
a
white
lacing
aroma
is
faint
grains
and
a
tad
bit
of
the
hops
come
through
as
well
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
with
a
heavy
dose
of
carbonation
not
much
going
on
in
the
taste
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
yes
but
as
far
as
taste
goes
it
is
really
bland
the
only
way
i
will
get
this
again
is
if
i
am
in
a
chinese
restaraunt
and
it
being
the
only
thing
offered
light
yellow

white

frothy
crisp

is
above
avg
in
my
opinion
some
sweetness
but
not
overly
a
nice
crisp
rice
taste
and
some
hops
very
clean
and
smooth
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
i
wonder
why
i
havent
had
this
beer
before
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
to
style
i
prefer
ales
maybe
i
will
keep
this
in
the
fridge
for
visitors
and
let
them
taste
a
nice
clean
lager
granted
im
sure
i
rate
this
beer
on
the
higher
end
of
the
spectrum
compared
to
most
but
this
is
a
great
drinkable
beer
no
its
nothing
to
dissect
in
detail
and
analyze
life
over
but
with
any
asian
dish
this
one
sure
satisfies
not
very
depthy
or
complex
but
a
great
tasting
beer
a
nice
clean
pine
nut
hoppy
pilsner
taste
reminds
me
of
a
molsen
lager
only
arriving
at
a
clean
bitter
hop
taste
sooner
stronger
and
leaving
quicker
tastes
much
better
when
cold
in
a
bottle
than
a
somewhat
flat
poured
slightly
warm
beer
in
a
glass
again
nothing
to
analyze
just
a
great
drinkable
beer
the
beer
pours
a
golden
cider
color
with
a
light
carbonation
very
clear
with
almost
no
head
skunky
smell
with
a
faint
sweet
aromatic
smell
very
faint
grainy
sweet
taste
but
lacks
much
flavor
at
all
the
feel
is
flat
and
creamy
almost
coating
your
mouth
this
is
not
too
bad
to
drink
but
i
would
really
want
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
there
is
almost
no
flavor
and
the
beer
is
not
exciting
at
all
id
just
as
soon
order
a
water
d
if
you
cant
tell
by
now
i
hated
this
beer
big
time
only
thing
it
has
going
for
it
in
china
is
the
fact
that
it
is
always
availiable
and
damn
damn
cheap
avoid
it
folks
not
terrible
not
good
very
us
macro
like
in
flavor
but
was
fine
with
the
spicy
mongolian
food
i
had
it
with
not
only
does
it
taste
like
water
but
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
that
of
tonic
water
going
flat
the
feel
of
this
beer
on
the
palate
is
very
bland
it
goes
down
way
too
easy
and
is
probably
one
of
the
worst
beers
that
ive
ever
had
i
will
never
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
will
encourage
others
around
me
not
to
buy
this
beer
it
is
not
even
worth
a
penny
let
alone
what
asian
restaurants
charge
for
it
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
worst
macros
i
have
ever
had
its
innocuous
a
good
pairing
with
yum
cha
i
found
helped
me
wash
down
the
chilli
sauce
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
for
the
sake
of
it
tsingtao
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
smell
is
grassy
and
grainy
perhaps
a
bit
skunky
definitely
getting
both
grassy
and
grainy
tastes
this
is
an
average
macro
style
lager
nothing
to
particularly
recommend
it
basically
average
all
around
nothing
particularly
redeeming
only
worth
having
if
youre
out
at
a
restaurant
and
theres
nothing
better
what
you
taste
first
with
tsingtao
beer
is
the
sweet
grainy
flavor
from
the
malts
this
taste
is
a
little
bit
bisquity
and
a
little
bit
like
rice
with
other
flavors
that
seems
like
a
touch
of
honey
has
been
added
this
is
followed
by
the
crisp
taste
of
hops
geez
horible
smelling
beer
obviously
suffering
from
light
strikenness
very
skunky
but
i
kinda
expected
that
from
the
green
bottle
and
the
lacking
seriousness
of
american
macro
lagers
the
look
is
an
ok
straw
with
fading
head
retention
once
i
got
past
the
aroma
the
flavor
revealed
a
grainy
oily
vegital
flavor
similar
to
rice
cakes
a
decent
amount
of
dms
shines
the
way
into
the
finish
not
a
particularly
pleasant
experience
mouthfeel
is
watery
finish
is
crisp
but
the
aftertaste
lingers
carbonation
is
fine
despite
its
flaws
or
perhaps
because
of
them
its
pretty
drinkable
especially
when
washing
down
some
chinese
food
but
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
appeal
on
its
own
d
just
a
very
average
macro
pours
a
very
light
clear
yellow
with
a
perfectly
white
head
that
lasts
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
though
this
doesnt
last
smell
is
pretty
standard
green
bottle
lager
though
with
less
skunk
than
is
perhaps
to
be
expected
light
hoppiness
and
some
adjuncts
round
out
the
aroma
which
if
not
stellar
is
certainly
passable
taste
is
slight
a
mild
hop
bite
over
the
light
maltiness
and
nothing
offensive
to
put
me
off
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
and
while
its
pretty
thin
it
suits
this
beer
well
drinkability
is
pretty
good
obviously
the
perfact
match
for
chinese
food
but
not
a
bad
lager
on
its
own
overall
a
great
balance
of
hops
aroma
flavor
and
bitterness
against
maltiness
and
carbonation
at
present
this
is
my
favorite
pilslightlager
i
would
place
it
in
the
german
pils
category
very
light
body
watery
with
some
fizz
in
the
mouth
wheres
the
alcohol
in
this
one
goes
down
like
water
almost
looks
like
water
as
well
i
will
think
of
this
as
an
asian
pilz
good
hot
weather
refresher
maybe
a
squeeze
of
lime
overall
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
if
at
an
asian
restaurant
with
a
limited
beer
selection
or
if
you
order
chinese
food
its
a
good
selection
otherwise
i
would
not
recommend
it
so
much
as
it
is
in
the
end
not
anything
special
overall
not
bad
but
no
aspect
of
it
stands
out
in
my
mind
although
its
forgettable
it
would
be
a
great
summer
quencher
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
its
not
so
bad
im
pleasantly
surprised
one
of
those
beers
you
dont
think
about
getting
ever
other
than
trying
just
to
say
youve
tried
and
finding
it
rather
enjoyable
but
dont
get
your
hopes
up
too
high
opinion
well
i
have
drunk
this
beer
a
lot
in
china
somehow
it
seemed
to
taste
better
there
but
this
may
have
been
because
i
was
dying
of
thirst
san
miguel
is
really
common
over
there
also
and
i
would
normally
pick
that
one
over
this
one
in
some
bars
there
is
a
very
short
shelflife
version
of
tsingtao
that
has
a
higher
abv
and
has
a
better
flavor
this
one
is
ok
but
not
one
that
i
will
drink
much
of
in
the
states
although
its
nothing
to
rave
about
im
surprised
how
drinkable
this
is
a
macro
style
lager
with
some
actual
character
wow
and
a
good
pairing
with
chinese
food
verdict
just
when
you
start
to
sort
of
enjoy
the
flavors
they
disappear
in
the
finish
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
admittedly
i
will
drink
it
at
a
chinese
restaurant
but
did
not
enjoy
it
without
eating
food
to
mask
the
blandness
of
this
beer
it
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
an
initial
head
that
disapears
quickly
and
completely
leaving
no
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
slight
skunky
smell
and
rice
aroma
it
has
a
slight
sweet
flavor
to
it
with
minimal
hop
presence
i
didnt
even
want
to
finish
the
one
bottle
i
had
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
its
an
alright
looking
beer
for
its
type
the
head
is
alright
but
the
lacing
is
almost
not
there
which
is
to
be
expected
the
nose
is
a
very
mild
touch
of
hops
you
really
have
to
look
for
it
the
taste
is
very
average
very
similar
to
czechvar
budweiser
budvar
except
without
the
distinguishing
grassy
flavor
of
the
czech
pilsner
the
mouthfeel
is
unexceptional
thin
but
thats
to
be
expected
its
an
alright
beer
perhaps
just
not
my
style
but
other
than
its
averageness
its
got
nothing
going
against
it
it
could
be
easiliy
consumed
en
masse
if
there
werent
anything
better
around
taste
very
mellow
malts
with
some
light
yet
springy
hopping
a
lot
of
plain
grain
flavors
e
g
rice
had
this
at
the
peking
duck
house
in
chinatown
in
nyc
as
i
expected
it
was
a
thin
watery
pale
brew
that
had
the
faint
skunky
aroma
that
accompanies
all
green
bottle
beers
was
otherwise
unremarkable
aroma
was
faintly
hoppy
but
mosty
sweet
adjuncts
taste
was
mild
watery
with
some
cereal
grains
mostly
cornrice
and
dough
notes
litttle
or
no
aftertaste
just
overall
a
bland
brew
drinkable
kinda
sorta
yes
but
why
drink
this
when
there
is
so
much
better
available
the
body
is
light
and
weak
really
there
isnt
much
touch
overall
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
so
i
might
sing
tao
but
i
will
sing
thanks
rather
watery
looking
with
some
initial
head
passable
aroma
and
taste
not
a
great
rating
but
above
average
for
its
style
canadian
yeast
and
barley
you
say
crisp
and
slightly
better
than
expected
maybe
good
yangtzai
water
thanks
to
the
broken
6pak
lcbo
bin
drinkability
goes
down
easy
pours
a
yellow
color
some
carbonation
small
to
no
head
some
lacing
afterwards
which
does
not
hang
around
long
the
smell
is
kinda
sweet
and
skunky
the
taste
is
a
little
malty
and
watery
light
body
at
best
drinkable
but
not
by
much
i
would
not
recommend
this
at
all
pours
pale
straw
with
pristine
clarity
one
finger
head
fizzles
out
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
overpoweringly
lightstruck
and
blocks
out
any
other
odors
sweet
pale
malt
corn
and
rice
flavor
soon
overwhelmed
by
skunk
aftertaste
typical
light
body
and
high
carbonation
mouthfeel
slightly
acidic
finishes
fairly
clean
considering
the
spoilage
from
long
exposure
to
light
the
bottle
version
is
seriously
flawed
by
the
time
it
reaches
my
local
beer
store
but
id
love
to
try
some
on
tap
to
get
an
untainted
sample
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
white
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
nothing
no
layer
nothing
also
nothing
in
the
way
of
smell
except
a
lot
of
skunkiness
some
bitterness
but
no
maltiness
or
anything
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
weird
flavor
on
the
back
end
not
sure
what
it
is
but
it
isnt
good
theres
a
lot
of
carbonation
burn
and
real
thin
mouthfeel
this
isnt
very
drinkable
but
not
the
worst
ive
had
its
pretty
far
down
on
the
list
though
appearance
is
a
clear
straw
color
head
is
average
and
recedes
quickly
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
ok
slightly
sweet
theres
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
slightly
fruity
taste
to
the
beer
this
beer
goes
well
with
chinese
food
obviously
its
not
extraordinary
but
is
good
for
one
or
two
with
dinner
aside
from
that
i
wouldnt
really
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
one
this
brew
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
twofinger
in
height
white
and
recedes
quickly
the
aroma
screamed
of
skunk
when
the
bottle
was
first
opened
but
the
skunky
aroma
vanished
once
the
beer
was
poured
the
aroma
from
the
glass
is
midly
sweet
and
by
mild
i
mean
as
mild
as
it
can
be
the
taste
is
milder
than
the
aroma
if
that
is
even
possible
the
mouthfeel
is
to
style
light
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
not
too
much
overall
this
isnt
the
worst
macro
lager
i
have
ever
had
and
it
isnt
horrible
however
i
have
had
better
macro
lagers
and
know
they
can
have
more
flavor
nice
mediumgold
colour
not
much
head
but
the
carbonation
is
pretty
and
this
beer
dosent
look
flat
at
all
it
seems
to
have
travelled
well
in
that
green
bottle
because
im
not
getting
the
bad
skunkiness
that
most
euro
lagers
have
been
giving
me
smell
is
pleasantly
malty
a
bit
sweet
but
just
a
hint
of
cooked
veggies
to
make
you
realize
that
yes
this
is
a
macro
lager
taste
is
sweet
and
bready
mildly
alcoholic
very
lightly
hopped
a
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
but
the
carbonation
helps
you
forget
to
a
certain
extent
this
would
be
a
decent
lighttasting
lager
to
put
back
a
few
of
while
downing
asian
food
especially
the
spicy
variety
drinkabilityoverall
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
one
again
can
i
say
my
mom
forced
me
to
drink
it
ok
i
took
it
as
a
duty
to
review
it
not
the
worst
i
had
but
in
my
top
10
of
the
worst
unfotunately
worst
tasting
beer
ive
had
in
some
time
i
was
mildly
optimistic
after
the
pour
looks
nice
in
my
mug
but
holy
dinah
does
it
taste
terrible
drain
pour
avoid
drank
at
a
chinese
restaurant
was
a
little
worried
about
the
green
bottle
overall
a
decent
beer
was
pleasantly
surprised
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
film
of
head
scent
is
light
some
light
grains
grassy
and
floral
hops
no
skunk
i
guess
the
bottles
were
stored
properly
tastes
plain
but
good
sort
of
like
a
bland
decent
thirst
quenching
homebrew
light
sweet
crispness
followed
by
a
small
amount
of
floral
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
overall
a
drinkable
session
lager
tsingtao
can
take
its
place
among
the
worlds
best
german
beers
in
this
class
tsingtao
beer
is
a
great
german
beer
that
just
happens
to
have
been
brewed
in
china
lite
and
fairly
tasty
this
makes
for
a
decent
drinker

had
several
with
dinner
and
they
all
tasted
the
same
i
would
imagine
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
if
having
some
spicy
chinese
dishes
when
you
would
down
several
during
a
meal
it
is
not
at
all
heavy
or
filling
any
other
time
however
i
would
stay
clear
of
this
overall
a
nondescript
beer
its
verging
on
being
offensive
and
undrinkable
but
its
not
quite
that
far
gone
i
had
a
bottle
here
in
berne
yesterday
when
visiting
a
chinese
style
foodcourt
and
almost
had
a
shock
the
distinctive
taste
this
smoky
bitterness
of
tsingtao
was
there
however
very
diluted
and
watery
my
suspicion
is
tsingtao
is
using
a
milder
or
in
other
words
watery
style
for
export
sad
the
original
tsingtao
would
earn
a
3
definitely
drinkable
if
youre
in
the
right
mood
or
having
chinese
or
spicy
food
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
anything
about
the
beer
in
fact
im
dumping
34
of
the
bottle
down
the
drain
it
poured
a
straw
color
with
a
head
that
didnt
stick
around
all
that
long
and
left
no
lacing
the
beer
smelled
sweet
and
had
a
taste
on
the
sweet
side
as
well
i
got
a
lot
of
grain
flavors
and
a
surprising
although
neither
overpowering
or
negative
sweet
character
from
the
light
mouthfeel
beer
it
went
down
really
well
with
the
chinese
food
i
had
ordered
at
the
restaurant
and
something
that
i
could
imagine
being
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
all
and
all
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
am
pretty
surprised
with
the
level
my
level
of
enjoyment
with
this
one
the
taste
seems
to
compliment
chinese
food
well
and
goes
down
pretty
cleanly
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
and
ends
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
its
not
an
amazing
beer
but
it
is
a
very
ok
beer
especially
for
the
fun
of
drinking
a
chinese
beer
in
a
chinese
restaurant
as
a
side
note
ive
heard
that
this
is
easily
the
worst
of
the
tsingtao
products
and
that
the
ones
they
keep
in
china
are
vastly
superior
not
sure
if
its
true
but
makes
me
wanna
try
one
all
the
same
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
lager
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
weak
malt
and
hops
with
bad
case
of
skunk
in
the
back
taste
is
pretty
inoffensive
apart
from
the
bad
case
of
skunkyness
you
have
to
wondered
why
they
import
all
those
crappy
lager
into
north
amercia
composed
of
sweet
grassy
notes
some
malt
a
hint
of
skunky
sulphur
bitter
hops
and
bread
medium
body
light
carbonation

seems
to
be
designed
to
compliment
chinese
food
and
i
usually
order
one
when
at
a
chinese
restaurant
one
was
enough
it
was
on
to
a
tawny
port
with
dessert
anyway
not
a
great
lager
by
any
standards
it
does
however
have
an
odd
taste
all
its
own
almost
indescribably
weird
semisweet
malts
and
some
rather
lackluster
hops
fairly
nice
sweet
scent
though
more
flavorful
than
many
macros
but
not
really
in
any
good
way
i
dont
think
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
anytime
soon
the
taste
is
also
sweet
almost
a
little
sugary
very
very
faint
hops
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
typically
thin
for
this
style
not
a
bad
beer
to
chase
down
a
spicy
dish
of
kung
pao
triple
it
is
not
much
different
from
other
chinese
japanese
beers
i
have
had
pretty
straight
forward
nothing
memorable
but
i
think
that
is
what
they
are
going
for
a
good
drinkable
beer
served
to
me
at
a
vietnamese
restaraunt
in
a
glass
the
appearance
was
golden
with
a
good
amount
head
which
quickly
fizzled
not
distinctive
smell
except
a
slight
sweetness
taste
had
a
noticeable
sweetness
similar
to
a
miller
high
life
no
remarkable
characteristics
a
rather
thin
but
passable
mouthfeel
matches
up
well
to
spicy
food
but
not
as
enjoyable
as
a
thai
sigha
decent
with
a
meal
but
thats
pretty
much
all
its
good
for
i
was
expecting
quite
a
bit
more
perhaps
this
bottle
was
a
bit
old
but
it
tasted
exactly
as
it
looked
like
piss
my
bottle
poured
with
absolutely
no
head
and
was
a
horrifically
ugly
yellow
far
far
worse
than
the
budcoorsmiller
trifecta
for
a
mass
produced
lager
give
me
one
of
those
over
this
any
day
md
very
clean
feel
that
is
something
i
could
drink
again
especially
with
chinese
nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
i
can
think
of
about
10
micro
am
lagers
that
take
this
to
school
i
poured
this
one
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
must
be
an
old
picture
of
the
bottle
and
label
on
the
website
mine
is
different
looking
this
beer
pours
a
very
transparent
golden
yellow
color
practically
no
head
retention
and
not
much
visible
carbonation
at
all
quite
a
poor
looking
beer
by
any
standards
the
nose
is
a
little
skunky
but
not
too
overpowering
the
taste
is
not
bad
definitly
better
than
the
appearance
somewhat
skunky
at
first
yet
the
finishing
taste
is
a
little
bland
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
what
else
could
i
expect
im
not
sure
if
i
could
down
a
whole
lot
of
these
but
one
or
two
is
not
bad
not
good
but
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
either
pours
crystal
clear
like
an
adjuncy
should
nose
was
a
little
bready
with
faint
grass
and
malt
not
a
single
skunky
iota
of
smell
taste
was
bubbly
and
crisp
the
adjunct
must
be
rice
there
was
no
corn
taste
thin
mouthfeel
as
expected
man
this
goes
down
easy
with
spicy
or
sweet
sauces
nice
beverage
not
for
my
fridge
but
i
do
enjoy
it
with
my
chinese
repasts
sampled
at
the
chinese
restaurant
at
epcot
in
florida
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
2
finger
light
and
bubbly
head
the
nose
was
slightly
grainey
with
a
ever
so
slight
hop
nothing
really
special
the
flavor
surprised
me
a
bit
there
was
almost
a
gingery
tinge
in
there
i
found
it
very
refreshing
with
some
honey
seseame
chicken
the
feel
was
moderate
with
a
healthy
carbonation
also
very
refreshing
much
better
than
i
had
expected
from
the
initial
pour
i
would
probably
visit
this
again
when
dining
on
some
general
tsos
i
definitely
would
recommend
this
with
chinese
food
otherwise
id
say
its
about
an
average
beer
its
not
incredibly
remarkable
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
had
a
few
of
these
brews
at
a
pf
changs
restaurant
its
basically
an
everyday
common
lager
with
a
bit
more
malt
flavor
than
most
bright
yellow
color
with
a
respectable
head
and
a
grainy
smell
theres
a
little
sweetness
up
front
and
a
spicy
hoppiness
in
the
midtaste
the
beer
goes
well
with
food
and
is
fairly
drinkable
light
and
airy
simple
and
not
really
any
flaws
unfortunately
its
also
average
and
uninteresting
drinkability
i
dont
know
too
much
the
chinese
beer
scene
but
it
seems
to
be
typical
to
the
asian
macros
drinkable
but
not
exactly
an
exceptionnal
product
to
compete
on
the
world
markets
nasty
talk
about
a
skunky
macrobrew
pours
a
very
light
yellow
with
a
bit
of
white
head
that
is
gone
very
quickly
smells
of
skunky
hops
and
not
much
else
tastes
like
watereddown
american
macrobrew
but
has
a
strangeness
to
it
that
i
cannot
identify
a
unique
tinge
of
flavor
perhaps
resulting
from
the
regional
chinese
ingredients
used
mouthfeel
is
almost
like
a
sprite
extremely
carbonated
but
not
much
else
i
guess
its
drinkable
if
you
can
stand
the
taste
at
first
sip
it
tastes
like
many
cheap
eurolagers
but
after
a
few
more
its
better
character
comes
out
lightbodied
feel
breadlike
malt
flavor
backed
by
hops
slightly
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
crisp
finish
reminds
me
of
bitburger
i
imagine
it
would
go
great
with
spicy
oriental
dishes
this
is
what
american
macros
should
taste
like
im
not
quite
ready
for
a
6
pack
but
i
will
have
have
it
again
maybe
for
chinese
new
years
feb
8th
and
9th
and
raise
my
glass
of
green
island
beer
to
the
start
of
the
year
of
the
rooster
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
are
solidly
average
the
beer
does
hold
up
well
to
spicy
food
so
that
is
a
point
in
its
favor
what
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
unusual
by
domestic
stand
points
or
even
most
international
while
i
isnt
horrable
it
does
leave
a
bit
to
be
desired
moderate
flovor
not
weak
not
potent
about
this
biterness
of
a
back
but
with
not
as
clean
a
flavor
all
in
all
not
a
horrable
beer
but
one
i
cant
see
drinking
every
day
rather
drinkable
if
you
need
something
refreshing
clear
gold
body
small
fizzy
white
head
smells
of
skunked
grass
malts
and
not
much
else
taste
is
thin
and
weak
only
a
couple
hints
of
grassy
malt
breaks
through
the
watered
down
flavor
whats
the
point
of
this
beer
get
american
macros
that
are
better
for
less
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
thin
spritzy
head
that
leaves
decent
lace
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
grassy
hops
with
crackers
and
a
slight
malt
sweetness
to
balance
theres
also
a
distinctive
yeast
smell
the
taste
is
somewhat
hoppy
with
a
dry
firm
malt
base
i
think
i
detect
rice
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
though
quite
crisp
i
guess
from
the
yeast
strainand
or
carbonation
this
beer
is
hoppier
than
most
macro
lagers
and
is
therefore
better
to
me
i
will
often
order
this
beer
when
i
am
at
a
chinese
restaurant
and
it
compliments
various
dishes
well
a
nice
alternative
to
a
heineken
or
budweiser
if
i
am
at
a
store
and
searching
for
a
6
pack
this
is
very
rarely
a
preference
big
foamy
head
at
pour
that
hangs
around
too
long
pale
straw
color
and
generic
beer
smell
hard
to
get
a
good
sip
out
from
under
the
hunka
foam
taste
makes
me
yearn
for
the
more
complex
flavor
profile
of
a
budweiser
after
some
effort
i
can
taste
a
little
malt
sweetness
and
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
to
paraphrase
the
old
stereotype
it
takes
much
less
than
an
hour
again
for
me
to
be
thirsty
for
a
real
beer
again
it
doesnt
taste
bad
per
se
just
has
no
taste
at
all
drinkability
the
sweetness
ruins
it
for
me
had
it
with
my
freshly
made
korean
beef
with
noodles
and
it
slightly
spoiled
my
dinner
experience
should
have
stuck
with
a
nice
sweet
wine
instead
of
this
socalled
beer
green
355
ml
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pale
straw
body
with
a
crackly
wispy
white
head
gotta
love
green
bottles
gee
i
wonder
if
this
has
anything
to
do
with
these
skunky
aromas
pouring
out
of
the
glass
actually
the
skunk
isnt
too
bad
but
its
there
theres
also
some
light
cerealy
malt
and
a
touch
of
true
lowkey
hops
goes
down
with
some
lightly
sweet
malt
up
front
followed
up
with
a
very
modest
dose
of
balancing
hops
not
bad
could
wash
down
some
good
chinese
food
although
id
prefer
a
good
pale
ale
or
ipa
with
some
spicy
szechwan
i
cant
see
buying
this
again
unless
at
a
chinese
restaurant
or
back
in
china
where
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
there
trust
me
its
way
better
than
some
of
the
cheap
swill
youll
find
in
dirty
20
oz
bottles
taste
mostly
grains
and
slight
hop
bitterness
and
very
faint
floral
taste
as
it
warmed
drinkable
but
not
too
good
dont
really
care
for
this
one
a
good
pale
lager
great
little
refreshing
session
beer
great
with
chinese
or
indian
food
drinkability
i
wouldnt
drink
it
outside
a
chinese
restaurant
not
a
very
good
drinking
beer
on
par
with
michelob
ultra
in
my
opinion
tsingtao
is
a
barely
drinkable
adjunct
lager
that
would
leap
into
the
undrinkable
category
if
consumed
at
greater
than
55
degrees
maybe
i
was
able
to
consume
it
with
my
chinese
food
all
those
years
because
my
love
of
spicy
dishes
deadened
my
taste
buds
to
the
beery
depredations
of
this
closetonasty
far
east
import
stay
away
my
first
new
beer
in
quite
a
few
weeks
and
i
picked
a
fairly
good
one
of
course
it
would
have
helped
me
to
get
this
beer
if
only
id
known
that
its
name
is
pronounced
jntow
but
the
server
didnt
have
too
much
trouble
figuring
me
out
it
pours
a
dull
goldenyellow
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
thats
not
too
thick
or
lasting
the
smell
is
sweet
and
fairly
generic
without
too
much
of
a
distinctive
character
this
beer
starts
exceptionally
smooth
especially
for
a
lager
and
then
settles
on
the
tongue
with
even
amounts
of
sugar
and
cinnamonlike
flavors
it
is
mediumbodied
though
almost
lightbodied
the
finish
is
the
most
unusual
part
of
tsingtao
once
the
somewhat
weak
flavors
of
the
beer
are
headed
to
the
back
of
your
throat
a
practically
overpowering
alcoholic
flavor
invades
your
mouth
on
my
first
mouthful
i
compared
it
to
listerine
i
have
searched
far
and
wide
and
have
finally
found
a
lager
i
truly
enjoy
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
white
foam
cream
head
that
is
quite
impressive
lacing
is
thick
and
foamy
the
smell
is
of
grain
with
slight
skunk
hints
of
earth
and
slight
malt
the
taste
is
smooth
and
sweet
the
grains
have
a
sweetness
to
them
that
is
quite
unusual
almost
caramel
grains
slight
bready
taste
the
sweetness
is
creamy
and
refreshing
but
still
light
and
lager
like
cleans
the
palate
well
the
most
drinkable
lager
out
there
goes
great
with
chinese
food
great
cooking
beer
as
well
drinkability
this
beer
went
really
well
with
the
chinese
food
i
was
eating
even
without
the
food
i
could
imagine
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
however
at
tsingtaos
normal
price
there
are
better
beers
to
buy
and
many
of
equal
quality
that
cost
less
still
i
imagine
having
one
again
with
chinese
not
skunky
like
eurolager
nor
cornswilly
like
the
usual
north
american
suspects
i
could
deal
with
this
next
time
im
eating
chinese
food
or
better
yet
thai
if
pressed
remarkably
unremarkable
and
the
spicier
the
food
pairing
the
better
theres
really
not
much
to
this
brew
and
i
expected
more
as
i
remember
it
being
more
flavourful
in
the
past
pours
a
fairly
clear
golden
colour
not
american
macro
clear
but
not
much
better
minimal
to
no
head
here
rfom
a
vigerous
pour
the
smell
was
of
straw
grain
and
corn
perhaps
theres
somewhat
of
a
dirty
smell
and
flavour
here
too
which
makes
this
one
whilst
more
flavourful
and
fullerbodied
than
an
american
macro
less
appealing
to
drink
ive
had
far
more
enjoyable
asian
brews
than
this
one
certainly
nothing
special
thumbs
down
this
is
definitely
an
asian
tasting
beer
which
isnt
really
a
good
thing
strong
rice
flavor
along
with
a
semi
sweet
taste
a
little
like
sugar
added
to
a
beer
after
fermentation
is
complete
the
body
was
nice
and
full
but
there
wasnt
too
much
in
it
the
aftertaste
was
atrocious
like
said
before
a
sweaty
sock
this
might
go
well
with
a
rice
dish
bc
of
all
the
rice
in
it
actually
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
expected
this
beer
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
as
long
as
its
cold
my
only
objection
is
the
sweatlike
aftertaste
yuck
it
has
a
pleasant
color
only
no
head
to
speak
of
i
guess
the
old
idea
that
it
goes
well
with
chinese
food
held
true
although
its
not
a
beer
ill
buy
again
oelergud
not
an
outstanding
import
but
i
enjoy
this
with
spicy
asian
food
this
beer
exceeded
my
low
expectations
for
it
and
was
better
than
i
recalled
after
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
i
had
earlier
today
im
definitely
finding
my
feet
are
now
firmly
back
on
the
ground
always
super
drinkable
with
chinese
or
thai
food
a
reference
brew
for
a
class
i
call
asian
pale
asian
beers
are
just
different
really
need
their
own
classification
perhaps
if
it
was
ice
cold
it
wouldnt
be
so
bad
but
as
for
now
it
just
isnt
for
me
very
pale
straw
colored
body
with
a
frothy
white
short
lived
head
fed
by
fake
carbonation
clean
grainy
malt
smell
with
notes
of
grassy
hops
cloyingly
sweet
diluted
corn
syrup
like
taste
is
pretty
bad
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
make
this
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
it
would
otherwise
be
on
par
with
mass
produced
beers
from
the
big
three
and
only
worth
sampling
as
a
novelty
my
chinese
friend
at
work
handed
this
to
me
as
a
free
sample
i
would
not
buy
it
and
ill
have
to
try
to
get
him
to
sample
some
of
the
better
pale
lagers
so
that
he
wouldnt
either
yet
another
international
pale
lager
holy
moley
it
smells
like
someone
ran
over
a
skunk
in
alexgashs
kitchen
when
we
cracked
open
this
thing
ive
never
smelled
a
more
skunky
beer
looks
like
all
the
other
lager
pales
taste
is
a
pleasant
surprise
however
a
very
sweet
tasting
lager
sugared
bread
or
cereal
dominates
no
adjuncts
and
pretty
drinkable
if
only
the
skunk
was
gone
this
would
be
a
mighty
fine
pale
lager
i
know
thats
not
saying
much
very
pale
yellow
color
clean
no
floaties
and
almost
clear
appearence
pours
with
a
big
white
head
but
it
does
not
last
long
and
doesnt
leave
much
if
any
lace
the
only
aroma
i
got
from
this
beer
was
a
light
sweet
kinda
grain
smell
i
could
dissern
no
hops
at
all
the
taste
was
again
lightly
sweet
at
first
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
the
sweet
grainy
finish
i
was
not
impressed
because
the
flavor
doesnt
stay
with
you
very
long
this
isnt
bad
but
there
are
many
other
better
choices
even
if
you
limit
yourself
to
pale
lager
why
bother
it
looks
like
your
basic
lager
pale
yellow
but
it
does
have
a
decent
white
head
not
much
retention
or
lacing
it
smells
like
your
basic
lager
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
with
barely
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
much
the
same
mostly
sweet
with
not
quite
enough
hops
i
suppose
its
drinkable
because
there
isnt
much
to
it
but
i
have
to
admit
id
probably
take
a
high
life
or
a
grain
belt
premium
before
this
maybe
ill
try
this
again
at
a
chinese
restaurant
but
i
usually
default
to
sapporo
i
dont
think
this
is
better
its
ok
for
a
production
beer
the
archetypal
lager
color
a
bright
gold
typical
head
modest
and
bright
white
frothy
in
texture
the
lace
thin
nose
is
quintessential
lager
malt
and
crisp
start
is
sweet
top
is
cadaverous
finish
is
moderate
in
carbonation
hops
apropos
to
the
style
not
a
very
good
beer
by
any
countries
standards
but
they
sell
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
it
had
this
at
a
local
chinese
restaurant
and
i
will
make
sure
to
never
make
that
mistake
again
pours
a
straw
color
with
not
much
head
aroma
was
kinda
skunked
with
some
grainy
aromas
popping
thru
faintly
taste
is
pretty
bland
some
corn
flavors
with
a
very
light
fruitiness
but
not
much
here
at
all
a
light
malty
aftertaste
but
not
much
here
seemed
a
litttle
watery
not
much
here
a
waste
eating
space
the
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
and
had
a
decent
white
head
however
the
head
didnt
last
much
longer
than
those
stupid
crappy
snakes
that
you
light
on
july
4th
and
that
are
supposed
to
grow
but
really
only
leave
a
smoldering
stinking
mess
the
aroma
was
mild
a
little
flowery
not
much
malt
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
very
much
like
honey
almost
meadlikenot
sure
if
it
was
because
the
bottle
wasnt
a
good
one
i
was
drinking
it
with
other
people
who
had
it
before
and
said
it
tasted
off
i
didnt
mind
the
honey
though
it
enhanced
the
mouthfeel
but
this
beer
is
still
one
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
other
than
in
a
chinese
restaurant
12
oz
green
bottle
served
at
pf
changs
in
pbg
medium
yellow
to
light
golden
pour
dingy
rocky
off
white
head
lasted
for
a
few
sips
then
faded
some
nice
smells
of
bready
malt
way
in
the
distance
mostly
wet
grainy
smells
some
crisp
lager
like
tastes
not
alot
of
malt
spicy
hop
presence
toward
the
end
bitter
and
crisp
somewhat
muddled
flavors
but
somehow
faintly
refreshing
a
decent
lager
not
much
more
it
will
be
a
long
while
before
i
reach
for
another
one
a
nice
looking
golden
lager
with
minimal
head
and
very
little
if
any
lacing
this
beer
didnt
have
a
strong
smell
but
thats
not
really
to
be
expected
with
this
style
of
beer
the
taste
was
bold
and
mellow
with
a
nice
crisp
taste
a
little
flowery
and
grainy
still
a
decent
beer
and
again
goes
well
with
a
asian
oriented
meal
popured
a
clear
yellow
colour
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
thick
head
that
quickly
disapates
the
scent
was
grainy
yet
flowery
there
was
detection
of
hops
and
malt
the
taste
was
also
very
grainy
with
flowery
hop
accents
the
carbonation
was
a
little
too
strong
for
my
taste
but
it
wasnt
that
bad
a
beer
good
with
a
chinese
buffet
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
color
that
was
well
carbonated
it
produced
a
white
fluffy
head
that
lasted
only
a
short
moment
before
it
fell
to
almost
nothing
but
a
thin
ring
there
was
some
lace
detected
the
aromas
that
i
detected
were
of
grains
sweet
malt
hops
and
flowers
very
light
over
all
the
tastes
were
more
distinct
and
detectable
flavors
of
hops
grains
husks
some
light
malt
and
dandelions
seemed
to
be
the
only
things
that
were
stand
out
the
aftertaste
was
very
light
some
hops
were
noticeable
but
did
not
last
very
long
the
body
was
light
this
beer
to
me
was
surprisingly
crisp
and
clean
and
quenched
my
thirst
well
over
all
impression
is
very
light
in
aromas
and
the
tastes
were
decent
but
nonlasting
which
in
some
circumstances
is
a
good
thing
probably
a
fairly
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
for
me
tsingtao
is
one
of
my
favorite
asian
beers
its
especially
well
suited
for
spicy
asian
dishes
paired
off
against
most
american
macros
ill
take
a
tsingtao
every
time
overall
a
decent
beer
that
you
can
use
to
wash
down
a
meal
with
or
use
for
beer
drinking
games
nice
choice
if
better
opportunities
dont
present
themself
nothing
spectacular
however
head
to
head
with
molsons
canadian
and
golden
this
beer
has
the
fullbody
of
the
golden
and
the
dry
quenching
bitterness
of
the
canadian
a
good
triangulation
i
would
say
toasty
buttered
grain
flavors
are
delivered
without
any
condescending
sweetness
hops
are
unobtrusive
decent
lager
in
a
pinch
i
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
tsingdao
it
brings
back
a
lot
of
good
memories
of
my
visit
to
zhongshan
last
christmas
well
like
everyone
else
it
seems
i
had
this
while
out
at
a
chinese
restaraunt
last
night
if
anything
it
paired
ok
with
the
curry
chicken
i
had
but
in
drinking
and
reviewing
before
my
food
was
served
on
its
own
i
e
not
drunk
while
eating
its
not
quite
a
beer
masterpiece
here
goes
pours
a
clear
golden
with
no
head
you
can
watch
the
bubbles
float
up
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
musty
dry
cardboard
thankfully
it
didnt
taste
that
way
but
my
notes
say
that
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
the
taste
was
sweet
but
soapy
dont
run
out
and
buy
this
one
if
you
are
at
chinese
restaraunt
and
want
to
drink
locally
aah
i
guess
thisll
do
it
was
ok
to
drink
while
eating
but
overall
below
average
pat
2
goes
well
in
hot
weather
tonight
is
hot
so
it
gets
a
favourable
review
otherwise
its
just
run
of
the
mill
carbonation
is
there
in
the
mouthfeel
but
overall
the
feel
is
light
nothing
worth
seeking
out
it
comes
across
as
a
heineken
modification
but
it
works
well
with
chinese
food
i
like
having
beer
from
the
same
country
as
the
food
so
ill
probably
have
it
again
just
had
with
a
chinese
meal
and
it
is
a
very
good
choice
for
one
pours
a
very
beautiful
golden
color
unfortunately
the
head
disappears
almost
instantly
not
much
of
a
smell
a
little
whiff
of
alcohol
but
taste
is
quite
good
light
and
refreshing
tastes
a
little
like
rice
clears
the
palette
and
accompanies
salty
chinese
food
quite
well
not
bad
overall
poured
a
very
clear
yellow
gold
under
absolutely
no
head
whatsoever
just
a
few
shortlived
bubbles
a
la
soda
i
detected
no
smell
at
all
at
first
but
then
picked
up
a
bit
of
ricey
malt
the
mouth
was
light
and
very
prickly
sweet
rice
and
malt
attack
the
tastebuds
at
first
chased
by
some
hoppy
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
mainly
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
thanks
but
id
rather
drink
stella
as
i
said
earlier
i
only
drink
this
coz
it
goes
well
with
duck
apart
from
that
i
wouldnt
drink
it
the
tsingtao
premium
in
the
gold
labelled
bottle
is
much
much
better
s
d
it
kind
of
tastes
like
an
interpretation
of
miller
high
life
with
an
odd
ultra
sweet
chemical
metallic
taste
not
terrible
but
certainly
nothing
to
go
out
and
buy
definitely
not
worth
imported
price
but
it
did
compliment
my
mango
shrimp
nicely
light
color
full
but
quick
disappearing
head
full
but
not
distinctive
aroma
highly
bubbly
absolutely
no
sftertastehas
texture
and
mouthfeel
of
a
light
beer
very
simple
totally
loses
flavor
with
food
almost
like
seltzer
water
it
does
however
clean
your
mouth
so
you
can
enjoe
your
chinese
food
a
gulping
beer
strictly
for
quenching
thirst
this
bad
tasting
average
macro
aspect
beer
is
nothing
short
of
pisswater
with
a
spin
on
the
bitter
end
sharp
and
ugly
flavour
probably
suiting
the
chinese
politburo
but
not
my
capitalist
high
quality
demanding
arse
pour
the
next
one
mao
cuz
along
this
production
line
the
next
youd
expect
is
another
revolution
appearance
pours
a
clear
straw
golden
fizzy
hue
with
a
bubbly
short
lived
white
head
absolutely
no
lacing
to
note
here
aroma
some
rice
is
definitely
evident
a
spritzy
sweetness
without
any
real
character
to
it
taste
it
does
do
well
with
spicier
chinese
dishes
but
i
would
still
rather
have
something
else
of
better
quality
myself
this
is
a
beer
produced
toward
the
masses
and
meant
to
be
light
refreshing
almost
without
taste
some
adjunct
ridden
sweet
tones
with
a
quite
simplistic
hop
character
just
a
touch
there
mouthfeel
thin
just
like
carbonated
water
no
difference
to
me
drinkability
a
beer
meant
to
be
consumed
in
number
not
enjoyed
for
each
beers
flavor
but
the
mass
produced
chinese
beer
that
sells
the
most
midyellow
vanishing
white
head
and
no
lace
the
smell
was
strictly
skunky
and
of
rotten
veggies
the
taste
was
horrid
being
very
metallic
and
of
a
flatnatured
lager
mix
the
feel
is
watery
and
acidic
ugh
why
would
anybody
import
this
oh
yeh
for
bas
to
review
way
too
many
off
flavors
for
me
i
generally
like
pale
lagers
but
not
this
one
seems
to
have
a
funny
peanutlike
aftertaste
its
pale
very
carbonated
think
chinese
rendition
of
heineken
but
i
just
dont
like
this
one
very
few
redeeming
qualities
even
most
chinese
restaurants
have
something
better
if
this
were
not
skunked
it
would
have
its
place
amongst
the
more
drinkable
fizzy
yellow
beers
still
this
is
crisp
and
somewhat
refreshing
and
although
this
is
going
to
sound
cliched
and
predictable
i
would
recommend
it
with
chinese
food
or
other
asian
cuisine
it
seems
like
its
made
for
that
type
of
food
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
and
unintersting
the
flavor
is
somewhat
skunky
reminescent
of
heineken
but
slightly
better
its
a
little
sweet
and
fairly
crisp
but
still
not
very
enjoyable
not
a
bad
beer
not
spectacular
by
any
stretch
but
it
will
do
just
fine
pours
to
a
dense
white
head
that
falls
to
fine
ring
and
clumps
of
white
bubbles
aroma
is
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
adjuncts
too
finishes
dry
and
clean
it
tates
like
it
would
be
a
good
choice
with
asian
cuisine
better
than
sapporo
or
asahi
i
had
the
choice
of
this
heini
or
corona
all
for
the
same
price
at
a
chinese
restaurant
i
thought
i
should
go
with
the
chinese
brew
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
and
i
didnt
get
much
from
this
beer
lager
is
hardly
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
found
this
offering
to
be
fairly
inoffensive
the
light
golden
appearance
and
the
fluffy
white
head
were
unimpressive
the
taste
was
a
little
grainy
and
yet
sweet
with
pretty
good
carbonation
no
flavors
bothered
me
there
was
just
nothing
there
to
impress
me
basically
this
is
a
pretty
inoffensivegood
enough
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
i
wont
mind
getting
it
at
a
chinese
restaurant
over
the
more
common
alternatives
green
640ml
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
although
i
usually
order
this
when
eating
at
a
chinese
restaurant
thats
usually
the
only
time
i
buy
it
this
was
an
exception
and
without
the
ethnic
meal
partnered
up
with
it
it
seems
pretty
mediocre
pours
out
a
very
light
clear
straw
colour
with
a
big
bubbly
head
which
dissipates
after
a
few
minutes
leaving
no
sign
of
lacing
nose
is
a
bit
skunky
at
first
then
sweet
with
mellow
hops
taste
is
a
sweet
biscuity
malt
and
light
floral
hops
sweet
yet
crisp
nothing
exceptional
but
goes
down
smooth
enough
if
youre
going
to
be
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
or
three
in
a
sitting
best
with
hot
weather
and
chinese
food
color
is
a
pale
to
clear
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
some
very
small
tight
lacing
smell
is
faintly
sweet
and
some
grain
as
in
bread
thats
soft
in
the
back
taste
is
clean
and
sweet
with
a
grainy
backing
thats
lightly
breadlike
and
finishes
with
a
small
bitter
hop
bit
that
drys
slightly
feel
is
light
crisp
and
clean
with
a
sweetning
thats
light
and
finishes
slightly
dry
and
bitter
from
hop
this
was
very
refreshing
to
have
with
my
mildly
spicey
thai
food
would
settle
for
this
over
many
other
asian
imports
poured
out
goldstraw
in
color
with
a
medium
white
head
smell
was
awful
skunk
and
corn
what
a
combonationno
pun
intended
taste
was
just
about
the
same
its
a
chinese
version
of
bud
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
with
carbonation
not
bad
the
only
good
thing
it
had
going
its
a
good
thing
i
had
some
food
to
cover
up
the
flavor
of
this
beer
will
only
drink
this
again
when
at
a
chinese
restaurant
or
if
forced
to
drink
it
this
brew
was
a
very
light
clear
golden
color
with
an
impressive
head
that
lasted
for
about
five
seconds
a
small
ring
was
left
around
the
edges
but
that
too
was
gone
half
way
through
the
beer
this
beer
had
a
grainy
smell
with
hints
of
corn
and
not
much
else
the
taste
was
very
light
i
really
couldnt
find
anything
specific
very
bland
it
was
kind
of
like
drinking
carbonated
water
the
aftertaste
was
terrible
very
skunky
and
just
weird
the
mouthfeel
was
extremely
thin
this
just
wasnt
an
easy
beer
to
drink
i
would
not
drink
this
beer
again
overall
a
decent
beer
but
with
some
off
flavors
and
aromas
that
just
dont
seem
right
why
use
green
bottles
still
i
continue
to
order
it
occasionally
at
chinese
restaurants
and
will
probably
continue
to
do
so
the
budwieser
of
china
this
is
a
macro
all
the
way
very
faint
hops
and
little
maltiness
dry
in
character
a
little
skunky
grain
aftertaste
quite
bitter
if
i
try
this
again
i
want
it
ice
cold
i
recommend
this
if
you
want
to
see
what
the
chinese
drink
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
its
drinkable
i
bought
this
to
go
along
with
the
szechuan
chicken
i
prepared
at
home
it
does
a
good
job
with
this
spicy
dish
its
pale
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
par
for
the
course
lager
coming
in
green
bottles
it
frequently
has
just
a
hint
of
skunkiness
the
taste
is
not
bad
but
just
a
bit
on
the
grainy
side
it
does
pair
well
with
spicy
mongolian
barbecue
or
at
least
better
than
the
big
ones
this
is
probably
my
fav
chinese
brew
my
grandfather
got
me
hooked
on
it
after
he
brought
it
home
from
a
chinese
restruant
they
wanted
18
for
a
sixer
of
it
instead
i
just
went
down
to
the
local
grocery
store
and
got
it
for
8
anyways
its
a
nice
pale
yellow
color
with
a
short
lived
white
foamy
head
you
can
definately
taste
the
rice
in
the
brew
it
does
have
a
small
hint
of
skunk
but
its
really
not
that
bad
its
very
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easily
even
quenches
your
thirst
i
guess
the
only
bad
thing
about
it
is
that
the
money
goes
to
the
commy
government
of
china
oh
well
its
still
a
darn
good
brew
this
chinese
lager
pours
out
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
and
leaves
the
slightest
of
lace
aroma
of
pleasant
floral
hops
followed
by
a
hint
of
green
bottle
skunk
mixed
with
a
grainy
goodness
although
from
china
the
taste
follows
the
usual
euro
lager
flavors
providing
a
slight
twist
by
being
a
little
more
grainy
and
alcoholic
in
nature
while
still
seeming
light
on
the
palate
overall
it
seems
pretty
clean
and
quite
refreshing
im
guessing
that
this
would
be
a
proper
beer
to
wash
down
some
hot
and
spicy
chinese
food
and
it
would
take
more
than
a
few
to
quell
the
fire
as
i
like
my
chinese
spicy
would
be
good
with
mexican
and
other
texmex
dishes
too
a
grainy
malt
aroma
nothing
special
dry
grainy
palate
with
deeper
flavor
than
ordinary
macro
brews
highly
carbonation
but
lacking
head
no
bitterness
or
floral
aroma
would
be
a
better
beer
if
it
came
in
a
darker
bottle
and
had
more
hops
decent
beer
but
no
need
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
it
pours
without
much
head
and
the
carbonation
is
low
pale
colored
this
is
really
a
lawn
mower
beer
and
not
something
you
want
after
shovelling
snow
again
slightly
sweet
but
with
a
faint
skunky
nose
the
drinkability
is
high
because
it
is
a
smooth
brew
lemony
gold
in
appearance
with
some
active
carbonation
but
virtually
no
head
aside
from
delicate
lacing
along
the
sides
smell
is
reasonably
strong
with
grain
and
floral
notes
coming
through
taste
is
somewhat
flat
however
with
dry
grain
flavors
ruling
the
day
mouthfeel
is
rather
firm
and
a
bit
too
persistent
for
my
taste
still
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
a
fine
choice
at
your
favorite
chinese
restaurant
tried
this
beer
in
a
chinese
restaurant
i
wanted
to
try
a
chinese
beer
and
it
was
the
only
one
on
their
menu
it
pours
a
golden
colour
topped
by
an
average
white
head
that
disappears
quite
easily
and
leaves
no
lace
as
you
drink
the
beer
aroma
consists
of
malt
taste
is
quite
average
with
nothing
special
to
offer
its
an
average
to
poor
lager
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
with
large
bubbles
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
of
malt
and
grains
with
some
floral
hop
notes
flavor
is
a
bit
unusual
a
sweet
maltiness
is
present
but
it
is
blended
with
a
bready
grainlike
taste
and
something
else
i
cant
quite
identify
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
a
good
partner
with
spicy
chinese
takeout
just
an
average
pilsner
knockoff
no
great
malt
taste
here
and
just
the
faint
presence
of
hops
goes
good
with
chinese
or
thai
food
mainly
because
it
sets
the
moodother
than
that
just
a
novelty
poured
golden
in
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
present
aroma
was
pungent
with
a
feint
hop
scent
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
taste
is
rather
bland
with
a
stale
dry
finish
and
hop
bitterness
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
beer
again
with
food
but
by
itself
it
is
rather
boring
golden
color
with
small
foam
that
disipates
quickly
average
pilsner
nutty
smell
and
flavor
with
a
slightly
bitter
initial
taste
its
good
to
add
to
chinese
food
go
figure
a
very
average
pils
mimics
the
american
standard
in
everyway
it
is
a
refreshing
but
lacks
any
substantive
hop
or
malt
presence
could
be
drank
in
quantity
on
a
hot
day
the
green
bottle
lent
to
the
light
struck
aroma
green
bottle
you
have
been
warned
sharp
and
peppery
up
front
then
dissipating
into
a
smoother
sugar
coated
malty
finish
very
similar
to
mainstream
amerikan
brews
only
maybe
a
hint
of
added
flair
not
worth
the
added
tax
in
my
opinion
if
someone
offeres
me
one
of
these
in
a
kind
gesture
i
doubt
i
would
object
but
i
would
never
spend
my
money
on
this
again
clear
tawny
yellow
in
color
with
a
bigbubbled
foamy
brightwhite
head
that
holds
well
eventually
dropping
to
a
collar
but
keeping
a
misty
foam
across
the
surface
from
rising
carbonation
light
aroma
of
grainy
malt
with
some
hops
way
in
the
background
mediumlight
body
with
a
spritzy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
of
a
mild
bready
malt
thats
well
backed
by
hop
bitterness
very
clean
with
an
interesting
character
that
i
cant
identify
finishes
crisp
with
a
shortlingering
mediumdry
maltiness
a
very
nice
beer
free
of
flaws
and
with
a
unique
character
certainly
worth
trying
as
it
delivers
much
more
than
its
appearance
promises
this
is
my
mainstay
at
any
asia
chinese
restaurant
in
the
boston
area
i
know
it
is
quite
fresh
and
clean
the
palate
well
with
some
grain
and
crisp
carbonation
it
holds
onto
a
slim
sweetness
as
well
very
pale
and
clear
color
decent
head
but
with
large
and
even
bubbles
i
couldnt
smell
a
thing
in
this
brew
maybe
a
trace
of
skunk
body
is
very
light
malt
is
ok
in
flavor
not
great
but
in
the
category
of
a
fresh
loaf
of
white
bread
with
sugar
on
top
watery
finish
not
crisp
to
me
theres
not
a
lot
of
hop
whats
crisp
to
others
is
dying
flavor
at
the
finish
to
me
why
spoil
chinese
food
with
this
when
a
great
ipa
can
clean
the
palatte
pale
gold
crystal
clear
with
a
flood
of
co2
surging
its
way
to
the
surface
good
head
for
the
style
doesnt
last
long
but
co2
continually
keeps
a
layer
of
lace
on
the
brew
very
little
smell
or
taste
this
however
means
theres
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
special
either
the
taste
it
does
have
is
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
not
really
an
enjoyable
beer
but
a
good
palate
cleanser
whilst
enjoying
a
chinese
buffet
for
dinner
tsingtao
from
china
pours
clear
with
a
slightly
dark
yellow
color
no
head
to
speak
of
maltysweet
aroma
some
skunk
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
toffee
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
up
dry
finish
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
very
light
body
but
with
a
whiff
of
skunk
that
really
takes
this
beer
down
a
notch
pale
straw
color
medium
light
body
mild
bitterness
mild
malt
mild
hops
dry
reminscent
of
fruits
pleasantly
and
clean
with
a
refreshing
carbonated
note
and
lingering
bitterness
better
than
bud
but
definitely
a
beer
for
light
weights
similar
flavor
to
heineken
but
more
skunky
slightly
nutty
and
hoppy
but
you
will
never
know
because
the
skunkass
green
bottles
will
kill
it
for
you
75
of
the
time
the
sparkling
clear
straw
hued
brew
is
covered
by
a
large
bubbled
head
that
exhibits
better
retention
than
typical
american
megaswill
light
grainy
notes
and
a
touch
of
a
spicy
saaz
hop
nose
along
w
generic
sweetness
hop
bitterness
is
above
the
norm
for
the
insipid
style
while
the
mild
bready
grain
notes
are
fairly
pleasant
corn
flavors
are
thankfully
absent
but
the
body
is
typically
light
due
to
the
apparent
large
percentage
of
rice
in
the
grist
tsingtao
finishes
crisp
clean
and
cleansing
yeah
its
bland
but
ill
take
this
over
a
bud
anyday
it
always
goes
well
with
chinese
and
other
oriental
food
but
i
can
not
imagine
myself
drinking
it
somewhere
in
a
bar
a
sickly
looking
pale
yellow
colour
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
morphs
into
a
mildly
lacey
ring
the
smell
is
a
turn
off
musty
raw
wetgrains
perhaps
but
noticable
almost
twofeet
away
little
taste
with
weak
malts
and
nonexistant
hops
the
feel
is
airy
but
a
light
shade
of
medium
bodied
drinks
better
than
i
thought
compared
to
other
fareast
beers
anyhow
probably
best
with
a
meal
chinese
eh
i
drink
in
the
name
of
beer
note
some
reviews
say
this
goes
well
with
spicey
chinese
imo
i
dont
think
so
i
had
the
real
spicy
sesame
chicken
and
it
still
tasted
gross
i
agree
with
michael
kennedy
extremely
dirty
unclean
flavour
and
a
dirty
sock
sweetness
quite
horrible
i
wouldnt
even
drink
it
when
eating
chinese
food
repulsive
clean
and
crisp
appearance
light
to
medium
head
a
little
floral
and
hoppy
smelling
taste
is
clean
with
nice
hops
to
malt
ratio
almost
a
little
sweet
kinda
fizzy
drinkabilitynotes
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
warm
weather
beer
no
head
to
speak
of
overly
carbonated
smelled
like
armpit
tasted
mediocre
at
best
slightly
sweet
and
hoppy
a
bit
soapy
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
to
bring
home
and
enjoy
on
its
own
but
i
have
no
regrets
about
drinking
it
paired
with
the
appropriate
cuisine
a
decent
light
lager
slightly
sweet
with
a
faint
hop
character
went
well
with
thai
penang
curry
i
think
you
guys
are
being
to
hard
on
this
beer
if
it
smells
funky
you
got
a
bad
bottle
get
it
from
a
store
that
knows
how
to
treat
a
beer
yes
this
is
very
light
but
as
a
light
lager
style
beer
it
is
good
when
it
is
fresh
it
has
a
wonderful
floral
aroma
that
works
perfectly
with
the
slight
malty
sweetness
is
it
the
best
beer
i
ever
had
no
but
it
has
light
charater
that
i
will
definately
drink
again
i
dunno
are
we
drinking
the
same
beer
i
thought
this
might
pass
for
lightly
beerflavored
soda
water
notes
a
most
unique
sweet
lager
and
it
stands
apart
from
most
imports
as
a
result
it
goes
great
with
chinese
food
but
even
better
with
chinese
chocolate
treats
waffers
and
freshly
bought
chinese
pastries
only
better
then
bud
cause
has
more
alcohol
among
the
worst
beers
of
my
life
not
very
good
taste
for
me
try
it
and
please
write
a
review
o
pretty
unoffensive
but
not
much
more
than
carbonated
water
this
would
appeal
to
a
nonbeer
drinker
outlier
detected
eye
roll
its
not
great
my
first
go
to
beer
from
back
in
the
day
more
flavorful
than
its
world
renowned
relative
and
i
found
it
more
enjoyable
cheap
beer
with
higher
than
usually
booze
gotta
lovehate
it
good
mass
produced
beer
very
drinkable
o
i
appreciate
the
thicker
malt
constitution
of
malt
liquors
and
the
like
but
this
comes
across
almost
as
if
they
froze
off
and
removed
some
of
the
beer
and
left
the
all
the
water
as
a
vehicle
to
drunk
it
does
the
job
but
id
prefer
a
little
more
of
what
something
like
old
e
or
colt
45
has
going
on
ill
sum
up
by
saying
this
beer
is
technically
impressive
but
sensually
flaccid
very
light
not
a
lot
of
taste
very
drinkable
but
overall
nothing
great
looks
great
but
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
very
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
i
had
one
of
these
fresh
out
of
the
freezer
put
it
in
the
freezer
30
minutes
ago
yeah
its
cheap
obviously
if
you
can
look
past
the
price
and
not
consider
this
to
be
trashy
or
whatever
this
stuff
is
good
i
will
compare
this
on
scale
with
other
ice
beers
busch
is
maybe
about
the
same
as
this
but
this
is
stronger
slightly
busch
ice
is
some
good
stuff
when
you
are
wanting
to
crack
open
a
brewski
for
cheap
and
relax
its
a
nice
golden
color
one
thing
dont
let
this
get
remotely
warm
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
it
tastes
like
beer
bought
an
18
pack
of
this
on
my
quest
to
find
the
best
ice
beer
so
far
ive
had
busch
natty
and
then
this
also
keystone
keystone
is
gross
this
is
a
good
solid
american
lager
its
not
offputting
or
meant
for
craft
drinkers
its
just
a
cheap
beer
isnt
bad
i
find
it
refreshing
after
a
long
day
of
work
i
have
a
beer
periodically
because
its
good
for
you
overall
2
01
not
worth
a
12
pack
but
for
a
one
off
with
leftover
pizza
its
okay
nice
smooth
flavor
with
a
frozen
feel
and
a
malt
character
its
still
a
crime
to
make
a
beer
this
bad
and
bud
light
is
better
tasting
and
i
dont
even
like
bud
light
overall
comparing
this
to
all
other
aals
i
see
nothing
offensive
about
this
at
all
in
fact
it
tastes
almost
like
every
other
american
adjunct
lager
out
there
i
have
a
feeling
that
when
people
rate
these
cheap
macro
adjuncts
they
rate
them
compared
to
the
diipas
and
10
barrel
aged
imperial
stouts
that
they
love
5
more
alcohol
than
bud
5
better
also
while
i
was
picking
up
a
can
of
bud
light
lime
appaleahhhhrita
was
that
the
right
number
of
hs
there
i
spied
a
can
of
bud
ice
and
remembered
id
never
tried
it
time
to
change
that
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
barely
exists
though
i
think
some
processed
cereal
grains
and
hard
water
come
through
maybe
i
dont
know
though
the
taste
resembles
your
usual
bud
light
with
some
processed
corn
hard
water
and
mild
biscuitlike
sweetness
though
a
hint
of
extra
booze
is
in
there
its
not
terribly
perceptible
but
its
there
on
occasion
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
watery
feel
overall
this
is
your
basic
boozeboosted
adjunct
lager
not
really
bad
per
se
but
decidedly
boring
and
tedious
not
bad
run
of
the
mill
ice
beer
for
an
ice
beer
its
probably
the
best
ice
beer
available
bud
ice
is
a
tolerable
effort
one
that
is
a
bit
better
than
natural
ice
if
thats
saying
much
i
like
its
smoothness
and
its
surprising
lack
of
anything
bitter
or
harsh
but
also
am
underwhelmed
by
its
lack
of
zest
or
anything
outside
of
the
ordinary
to
a
degree
its
almost
offensively
predictable
overall
a
disappointment
i
thought
it
would
be
a
bigger
bud
but
it
was
not
recommended
for
those
who
dont
enjoy
the
taste
of
beer
this
is
the
epitome
of
cheapcollege
beers
horrible
taste
but
after
one
16oz
you
stop
caring
about
taste
this
is
great
for
wanting
to
get
plastered
on
a
budget
other
than
that
do
your
self
a
favor
and
pay
a
few
cents
more
for
a
full
flavored
budweiser
ok
let
me
see
here
this
is
cheap
its
average
it
tastes
like
a
mixture
of
beer
and
a
sweet
taste
its
cheap
for
something
you
could
get
a
30
pack
of
for
13
99
its
still
better
than
natural
light
for
something
thats
so
cheap
that
its
almost
malt
liquor
its
good
but
there
are
much
better
options
available
ahhh
bud
ice
my
broke
bitch
beer
2
bucks
and
a
few
dimes
gets
you
32
ozs
of
delicious
beer
that
tastes
great
nice
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
but
leaves
me
burping
a
lot
i
enjoy
this
brew
compared
to
bud
light
which
i
rarely
drink
except
for
last
week
it
is
a
lot
better
in
taste
whereas
bud
light
tastes
like
sparkling
water
overall
this
is
about
what
i
expect
for
this
style
of
beer
in
this
price
range
its
nothing
special
but
nothing
repugnant
either
i
paid
1
99
for
the
tallboy
o
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
a
very
poor
lager
this
is
what
it
is
no
reason
to
drink
this
first
ill
start
off
with
how
this
beer
ended
up
in
my
fridge
well
as
i
said
i
am
just
beginning
my
beer
adventure
and
a
local
beer
and
wine
store
carries
a
free
book
that
lists
all
of
their
available
beer
and
wines
not
knowing
a
damn
thing
about
either
i
simply
decided
to
try
the
first
one
in
the
book
which
was
a
listing
of
their
domestic
beer
first
on
the
list
was
this
and
luckily
i
actually
like
it
its
light
and
to
my
taste
buds
has
a
slightly
sweet
taste
to
it
after
reading
the
reviews
i
see
alot
of
people
arent
a
fan
but
i
find
this
to
be
a
good
starter
beer
especially
for
the
ladies
its
light
in
color
taste
and
the
impact
on
your
wallet
i
got
a
12
pk
of
the
bottles
for
about
8
dollars
i
think
this
would
be
great
hanging
out
at
the
beach
or
pool
or
outside
on
a
hot
day
no
bitter
after
taste
that
i
hate
from
the
stronger
flavored
craft
beer
im
a
fan
i
would
definitely
repurchase
go
bucs
o
bought
this
large
bottle
as
a
joke
for
me
and
my
brother
a
few
sips
and
we
poured
the
rest
out
not
worth
drinking
imo
even
for
99
cents
for
a
18
ouncer
we
jokingly
dub
it
a
big
ol
ice
o
bud
for
reasons
unknown
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
not
offensive
i
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
enjoy
it
more
than
standard
bud
overall
not
one
of
the
better
bud
products
feels
like
it
should
be
stronger
than
what
it
is
considering
the
drastic
change
in
flavor
over
bud
this
taste
like
bud
but
stronger
i
drank
mine
cold
it
would
have
had
a
bad
if
warm
drinkabiliity
is
good
for
the
price
i
would
buy
this
again
average
beer
for
good
price
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
and
the
overall
taste
is
neither
interesting
nor
offensive
if
there
was
a
0
i
would
have
put
it
a
hint
of
mouthfeel
other
wise
corn
seltzer
held
about
a
14
inch
head
for
about
1
minute
just
a
really
poor
excuse
for
a
beer
most
ices
are
sub
par
but
this
one
is
dreadful
i
remember
bud
dry
which
gave
way
to
the
ice
but
at
least
bud
dry
was
in
a
dark
bottle
and
had
a
hint
of
hops
i
first
tried
bud
ice
down
in
arkansas
where
bad
beer
is
the
norm
i
guess
its
all
opinion
but
i
just
dont
see
it
never
again
anheuserbusch
bud
ice
1
55
and
in
case
you
couldnt
tell
this
is
my
favorite
beer
overall
ah
nothing
you
really
want
to
go
to
even
for
a
cheap
session
overall
malt
liquor
lite
this
has
all
the
downfalls
of
cheap
malt
liquor
without
the
benefit
of
high
abv
overall
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
not
the
worst
example
of
the
style
that
said
i
still
dont
like
this
beer
very
much
the
feel
is
seltzer
water
just
carbonated
water
at
least
its
crisp
as
ab
likes
to
tout
they
can
keep
it
poured
this
american
adjunct
lager
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
straw
color
produced
a
white
head
retention
was
poor
and
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
clean
some
faint
grain
aroma
light
in
body
this
is
a
clean
beer
somewhat
strong
flavor
of
grain
sweet
and
some
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
overall
not
a
beer
that
i
would
go
back
to
anytime
soon
ehh
this
may
have
been
the
first
time
i
ever
had
this
beer
but
it
was
bad
either
way
you
look
at
it
just
stick
with
budweiser
regular
reminds
me
alot
of
michelob
golden
draft
which
was
one
of
the
best
sessioning
beers
ever
ceated
i
miss
mich
golden
draft
this
is
the
typical
american
ice
lager
very
comparable
to
natty
ice
except
slightly
more
smooth
and
less
harsh
tasting
very
light
and
carbonated
with
an
almost
maltliquor
scent
taste
is
in
line
with
most
all
aals
but
slightly
more
heavy
on
the
malts
pours
a
really
orangishgolden
color
no
head
retains
and
no
lacing
not
a
good
beer
but
if
you
want
something
with
ice
on
it
this
is
a
safe
bet
wow
a
beer
i
never
thought
id
review
but
here
goes
pours
brassygolden
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
gotta
bless
the
brewing
wizards
for
that
slight
sour
and
adjuncty
nose
mouthfeel
is
more
than
expected
much
better
than
the
mainstream
bud
we
were
weaned
on
finish
is
pretty
much
non
existent
but
for
what
its
worth
i
expected
less
sampled
at
a
party
would
i
buy
it
on
my
own
no
is
it
drinkable
yes
the
best
bud
beer
period
easily
the
smoothest
and
the
best
tasting
you
can
pick
it
up
for
cheap
and
it
does
a
great
job
at
getting
you
drunk
a
definite
party
favorite
doesnt
taste
much
different
than
most
american
beers
but
much
better
than
anything
budweiser
or
bud
light
can
offer
it
is
altogether
much
more
drinkable
and
the
high
alcohol
content
will
get
you
where
you
need
to
go
not
my
first
choice
when
the
budget
allows
but
at
five
dollars
a
six
pack
it
does
stand
out
among
cheaper
beers
id
rank
it
right
around
classic
budweiser
as
far
as
my
taste
goes
that
said
it
would
certainly
make
a
good
session
beer
for
the
light
of
pallet
and
tight
of
wallet
among
us
pours
a
clear
very
pale
amber
color
decent
head
but
disappears
quickly
scent
is
weak
but
mostly
of
grassy
grains
taste
is
smooth
and
weaker
but
does
have
some
good
features
that
are
refreshing
and
drinkable
leaves
a
semidry
after
taste
and
is
decently
tasty
for
a
cheap
bud
brew
taste
not
much
insipid
and
nearly
flavorless
unless
you
count
wet
paper
as
a
flavor
wet
manila
folders
corn
co2
watery
astringent
and
overly
charged
with
co2
gaseous
and
burpy
almost
instantly
this
is
a
very
poor
aal
but
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
f
o
decent
cheap
beer
to
get
the
job
done
dong
pours
clear
gold
into
pils
glass
3
finger
head
gone
in
30
seconds
smells
frankly
like
vomit
taste
isnt
horrible
off
the
bat
plain
adjunct
taste
nothing
more
or
less
moderate
carb
and
clean
finish
crispy
with
a
bite
to
it
below
average
but
at
least
the
taste
isnt
too
bothersome
smell
is
truly
unpleasant
though
and
for
that
alone
i
almost
despise
this
brew
overall
got
this
from
a
friend
sine
i
drink
anything
i
accepted
it
gladly
not
very
good
but
i
like
this
more
than
a
lot
of
other
things
harder
to
find
in
the
preferred
24
oz
but
when
i
see
it
i
grab
a
few
for
backup
when
im
in
a
pinch
tried
this
one
at
a
friends
house
a
couple
days
ago
i
have
drank
many
buds
in
my
life
but
this
one
ranks
down
there
with
bud
light
lime
and
the
chelada
just
nasty
taste
of
rottin
corn
and
barley
even
ice
cold
the
stuff
is
a
drainpour
my
buddy
said
it
was
only
7
a
twelve
pack
and
thats
why
he
bought
it
for
the
card
game
there
is
a
reason
it
is
that
cheap
because
it
sucks
bigtime
normal
bud
is
much
better
personally
i
think
natural
ice
has
more
flavor
a
better
flavor
and
theres
more
alcohol
all
for
a
lower
price
id
get
natty
over
this
but
this
is
a
good
beer
all
its
own
this
is
definitely
a
miss
theres
nothing
here
worth
a
second
glance
this
is
just
another
foul
macro
adjunct
lager
oh
dear
god
i
can
not
believe
i
had
one
of
these
i
was
at
a
college
party
and
my
buddy
bought
some
of
these
to
be
a
game
called
edward
beer
hands
or
something
like
that
but
i
dont
play
beer
games
so
i
just
had
a
few
sips
of
it
and
gave
it
to
him
to
play
with
my
other
friends
anyways
this
beer
is
just
terrible
it
tastes
like
beyond
cheap
malt
liquor
has
a
weird
liquory
with
slight
malt
smell
the
taste
is
just
awful
maybe
i
am
ruined
with
these
kind
of
beers
but
i
gag
on
beers
with
no
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
horrible
too
i
couldnt
stop
burping
after
this
beer
overall
this
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
o
as
unappealing
as
this
lager
is
there
are
worse
beers
of
this
type
out
there
reach
for
this
one
only
in
case
of
an
emergency
and
even
then
think
long
and
hard
about
it
overall
neither
good
nor
awful
just
a
standard
macro
ice
brew
still
considering
the
almost
identical
similarity
to
bud
light
you
might
as
well
get
a
little
more
bang
for
your
buck
and
essentially
get
drunker
quicker
the
abv
will
put
you
through
the
floor
quicker
than
light
will
still
though
unmemorable
enough
for
me
to
stash
the
remaining
few
bottles
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
to
never
touch
again
taste
and
looks
like
water
no
aroma
no
head
i
hear
its
very
hard
to
make
though
and
they
get
it
the
same
every
time
i
guess
that
is
one
positive
oh
and
they
do
have
good
commercials
o
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
due
to
the
metal
taste
and
lack
of
any
other
flavor
it
is
cheap
though
but
its
just
not
for
me
i
actually
really
like
this
brew
it
is
cheap
it
does
the
job
for
sure
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
crap
if
poured
into
glass
it
is
golden
in
color
with
a
nice
smell
of
malts
and
a
little
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
nice
mouth
feel
happens
to
be
great
it
feels
between
a
budweiser
and
natural
ice
but
with
a
nice
balance
overall
drinkability
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
in
one
word
unrefreshing
all
off
flavors
no
good
ones
d
this
beer
isnt
awful
and
i
could
certainly
have
a
few
but
it
is
not
what
i
would
choose
to
go
back
for
the
taste
is
more
mild
than
i
was
expecting
it
tastes
a
lot
like
carbonated
water
and
a
tiny
tiny
bit
like
bread
it
doesnt
have
any
negative
taste
like
a
light
beer
or
many
macrobeers
so
thats
a
plus
i
guess
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
good
about
it
cheers
smell
grainy
wow
5
5
was
such
a
big
number
back
in
the
day
pours
light
golden
yellow
smells
stale
and
urealike
tastes
the
same
with
more
sweetness
to
it
than
a
regular
bud
overly
light
mouthfeel
and
an
unpleasant
rotten
aftertaste
to
be
avoided
overall
generally
very
tasteless
not
bad
but
not
interesting
at
all
it
would
be
a
good
general
drinking
beer
24
ounce
can
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
that
didnt
stay
around
too
long
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
breadygrainy
and
sweet
malt
not
much
else
to
it
with
that
being
said
the
aroma
isnt
offensive
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
its
mostly
bready
and
sweet
malt
with
a
metallic
bitter
taste
noticable
mouthfeelbody
is
light
and
it
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
bad
at
all
its
easy
enough
to
drink
i
certainly
wouldnt
make
a
point
to
drink
this
very
often
but
for
1
29
a
can
its
not
bad
and
when
you
buy
bud
ice
you
pretty
much
know
what
youre
getting
d
yeah
its
drinkable
but
why
unless
youre
under
21
i
used
to
love
bud
and
anything
bud
when
i
was
younger
but
all
bud
seems
to
do
know
is
cause
headaches
and
fills
you
up
too
much
thats
not
that
enjoyable
bud
ice
though
seems
to
be
my
favorite
of
the
buds
the
alcohol
content
is
pretty
high
compared
to
a
normal
beer
but
this
is
not
something
i
would
buy
persistently
24oz
can
ice
brewed
with
born
on
date
stamped
on
can
2
finger
head
that
went
to
nothing
almost
instantly
ultra
clear
with
absolutly
no
carbonation
within
moments
color
is
apple
juice
dark
yellow
this
smells
like
nothing
but
maybe
a
wiff
of
grain
the
taste
is
sweet
from
the
malt
and
alcohol
which
strengthens
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
harsh
it
actually
kinda
burns
a
bit
i
dont
think
its
from
the
alchol
as
its
only
5
5
abv
kinda
weird
feel
though
almost
like
a
seltzer
burn
from
the
carbonation
but
theres
no
carbonation
here
i
wouldnt
really
try
this
again
nor
reccomend
it
to
anyone
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
they
were
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
other
than
refreshment
which
has
more
to
do
with
temperature
this
one
doesnt
have
much
to
offer
not
a
bad
party
beer
or
summer
beer
i
know
i
have
rated
it
higher
than
most
here
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
how
good
this
12
pack
tasted
so
i
will
give
it
its
due
this
time
half
a
finger
head
pure
white
gone
in
seconds
color
is
a
6
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
of
wet
straw
damp
corn
and
sweet
barley
taste
is
harsh
and
bitter
but
a
sweet
aftertaste
flavor
of
corn
wheat
and
malt
little
mouthfeel
leaving
a
dry
feeling
in
the
back
of
my
throat
may
be
better
after
a
few
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
that
many
d
boring
bland
and
corny
very
watery
when
this
first
came
out
i
liked
it
to
me
it
had
a
dry
finish
that
was
good
this
is
another
beer
to
mow
and
play
golf
with
it
is
good
for
that
at
least
i
usually
have
this
in
bottles
when
i
do
have
it
and
it
tastes
fine
smells
ok
drinks
well
and
is
cheap
and
easy
to
find
it
is
like
the
rest
of
these
mass
produced
beers
i
would
drink
it
again
d
sure
this
isnt
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
for
its
style
it
really
isnt
all
that
bad
plus
i
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
it
from
back
in
the
day
in
the
marines
when
i
could
only
buy
a
six
pack
at
a
time
on
base
d
at
first
it
wasnt
too
bad
but
i
found
myself
cringing
toward
the
end
or
it
had
this
one
straight
from
the
16
oz
bowling
pin
bottle
pretty
cool
not
a
bad
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
didnt
really
smell
it
after
raking
leaves
for
2
hours
it
went
down
smooth
and
was
quite
refreshing
would
i
drink
it
again
not
unless
i
wanted
the
ice
chunk
bottle
for
my
collection
all
in
all
not
a
horrible
ice
beer
but
it
is
still
an
ice
beer
from
24
fl
oz
can
10297na66
sampled
on
november
13
2010
it
pours
goldenyellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
does
bring
out
some
malts
but
otherwise
it
is
corny
grainy
and
metallic
theres
a
creaminess
in
the
thin
body
the
taste
does
have
something
sweet
about
it
with
thin
hops
toward
the
end
but
it
really
does
not
blow
me
away
cheap
though
save
yourself
from
this
beer
must
have
dogfish
barely
even
drinkable
for
those
unaware
of
beer
goodness
to
quote
dave
chappelle
in
his
samuel
jackson
beer
skit
its
beer
it
gets
ya
drunk
that
is
the
only
thing
bud
ice
is
good
for
getting
you
drunk
it
is
one
of
the
worst
macros
in
flavor
and
drinkabilty
and
thats
like
being
the
heaviest
person
at
weight
watchers
it
is
not
the
trophy
that
you
would
put
on
your
mantle
unless
you
need
a
fix
to
stop
the
shakes
dont
drink
this
beer
pretty
much
in
line
with
the
ice
beers
from
the
ice
beer
wars
i
remember
in
canada
back
in
the
90s
generally
smooth
generally
inoffensive
generally
more
boozy
for
that
extra
half
point
of
abv
more
going
on
that
i
would
have
given
budweiser
credit
for
but
that
said
it
aint
nothin
to
brag
about
ive
had
worse
the
only
bright
spot
was
that
after
the
game
we
had
to
track
down
a
restaurant
to
sober
up
so
we
errantly
wandered
into
pyramid
brewery
looked
like
a
food
place
to
drunk
people
im
sure
i
enjoyed
their
hefeweizen
but
i
cant
remember
d
bland
and
brainless
but
also
pretty
inoffensive
its
definitely
not
hard
to
drink
but
its
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
enjoy
or
appreciate
it
says
something
that
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
even
though
it
scores
fairly
low
d
bout
as
drinkable
as
water
but
not
as
appetizing
skunky
and
harsh
with
a
thin
but
carbonated
texture
that
is
anything
but
smooth
there
is
no
reason
to
buy
this
beer
im
really
glad
that
i
tried
one
can
for
free
because
if
i
had
bought
a
twelve
pack
of
this
i
would
have
regretted
it
two
of
my
friends
tried
it
with
me
all
of
us
had
it
straight
out
of
the
can
and
they
literally
couldnt
even
finish
theirs
they
dumped
out
half
their
cans
in
the
grass
i
managed
to
get
mine
down
but
it
wasnt
pleasant
dpoor
too
carbonated
and
drinkable
if
ice
cold
im
not
really
sure
of
the
reason
for
this
beer
i
guess
it
has
a
bit
more
maltiness
than
a
regular
bud
but
im
not
sure
that
it
has
anything
else
different
to
it
if
possible
i
think
it
actually
has
an
even
more
limited
taste
than
a
budweiser
in
the
past
ive
tried
to
appreciate
these
kinds
of
beer
but
no
more
ive
had
too
many
good
beer
and
there
is
no
other
way
to
describe
this
than
bad
bud
ice
well
what
can
you
say
other
than
look
its
a
bud
beer
trying
to
have
a
different
name
pretty
much
i
think
that
this
one
is
alright
not
going
to
be
what
i
reach
for
if
im
going
for
the
big
3
but
wouldnt
say
no
if
offered
with
no
other
options
i
mean
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
still
beer
its
a
light
color
smells
like
nothing
and
tastes
icy
it
was
ice
cold
thanks
to
the
cooler
and
that
made
it
tasty
watery
but
thats
alright
because
your
not
expecting
anything
but
that
from
bud
ice
d
i
picked
this
24oz
can
at
a
gas
station
for
99
cents
all
of
the
other
beer
stores
were
closed
and
this
was
something
i
hadnt
troed
before
not
terrible
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pay
much
more
for
this
that
being
said
it
has
a
following
that
only
hitler
would
be
jealous
of
and
for
mere
pennies
more
you
could
upgrade
to
the
much
improved
busch
light
you
make
the
call
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
light
this
beer
made
me
chuckle
it
said
an
ale
but
on
another
part
of
the
can
it
said
lager
this
beer
is
tolerable
on
a
low
level
the
drinkability
is
very
low
it
is
a
beer
to
slam
and
not
to
enjoy
dooby
dooby
doo
thin
body
fizzy
carbonation
and
boozy
taste
make
for
terrible
drinkability
avoid
avoid
avoid
just
eating
out
of
the
garbage

be
better

anheuserbusch
did
a
nice
job
with
this
brew
overall
im
giving
bud
ice
a
4
5
out
of
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
wouldnt
be
hard
to
take
a
few
if
drunk
fast
without
thinking
but
not
worth
paying
attention
to
d
if
you
dont
care
about
flavor
and
just
want
to
get
blitzed
then
yeah
this
is
the
beer
to
have
cant
detect
any
alcohol
and
there
is
hardly
and
flavor
and
it
is
watery
you
can
pound
this
stuff
d
id
not
really
recommend
this
natural
ice
is
even
better
but
if
you
can
find
it
id
recommend
you
try
it
at
least
once
i
dont
get
it
rjt
dark
gold
with
no
head
but
some
carbonation
heavy
grainy
aroma
not
really
adjuncty
to
the
extreme
medium
full
body
hops
uh
i
smell
something
more
along
the
lines
of
rubbing
alcohol
pretty
smooth
with
a
crisp
malt
liquor
type
feel
it
misses
the
mark
in
the
refreshment
category
because
it
leaves
a
strange
unwelcome
astringent
aftertaste
oh
well
slam
a
few
quick
get
a
good
buzz
and
beware
of
the
penguin
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small

with
some
sticky

behind
the
nose
is

slight

the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight

note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
d
although
it
is
light
in
body
it
certainly
isnt
something
that
i
could
drink
many
of
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
only
if
you
are
drinking
to
get
drunk
it
is
better
than
some
of
the
beers
you
would
get
from
a
keg
but
its
not
as
good
as
regular
budweiser
or
bud
light
for
that
matter
it
really
doesnt
have
that
much
of
a
smell
to
it
at
all
grabbed
a
can
of
this
to
use
in
a
dip
for
the
super
bowl
party
tonight
and
decided
to
finish
off
the
can
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
this
pours
a
darker
than
expected
gold
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
on
top
retention
is
zilch
and
there
is
no
lace
at
all
scents
of
corn
mash
and
sugar
the
body
is
crisp
and
refreshing
as
expected
flavor
is
of
creamed
corn
with
the
subtle
sweetness
and
buttered
white
bread
light
bitterness
huh
color
me
surprised
this
was
actually
decent
and
hit
the
spot
this
afternoon
this
is
one
of
the
better
bud
offerings
imo
in
a
world
of
light
thin
noflavor
beers
this
one
stands
above
with
a
bit
of
flavor
and
body
id
have
it
again
methinks
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
fairly
sweet
malts
and
corn
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
corn
and
malts
with
a
slight
metallic
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
mediocre
beer
d
not
drinkable
at
all
in
my
opinion
d
normally
adjunct
lagers
are
close
to
water
and
easy
to
take
down
this
one
just
isnt
good
and
makes
it
tough
to
drink
although
this
is
clearly
a
beer
i
steer
clear
of
it
is
still
not
the
worst
ice
beer
ive
ever
had
that
distinction
belongs
solely
to
the
beast
still
i
dont
recommend
this
to
anyone
unless
they
are
dead
broke
and
theres
no
busch
to
fill
their
cravings
dispensed
from
my
kegerator
into
my
frosty
mug
and
also
into
my
mouth
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
head
smells
kinda
like
straw
and
alcohol
not
as
corny
as
i
would
have
expected
fittingly
the
frosty
mug
was
so
cold
it
froze
some
of
the
beer
ice
cold
is
the
way
to
drink
bud
ice
and
any
american
ice
beer
for
that
matter
its
fairly
highly
carbonated
and
served
vary
cold
its
fairly
inoffensive
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
comes
out
a
bit
more
overall
a
bland
fizzy
beer
d
not
too
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
since
there
isnt
much
to
it
mild
kick
despite
the
ice
in
the
name
decent
representation
of
a
lackluster
style
just
another
fizzy
yellow
beer
but
its
better
than
some
of
the
others
ive
had
from
ab
why
does
this
beer
exist
the
obvious
answer
is
to
sell
to
people
who
want
to
get
drunk
but
considering
this
is
only
5
5
abv
why
pick
this
over
the
regular
bud
if
you
want
a
high
alcohol
cheap
beer
try
one
of
the
malt
liquors
with
8
instead
of
this
i
would
rather
drink
something
that
tastes
like
water
than
this
light
beer
drinkability
not
bad
it
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
on
the
whole
however
this
is
not
something
im
going
to
run
out
and
find
for
myself
a
flash
of
grainy
and
semisweet
malts
is
followed
by
a
carbonation
blast
and
then
poof
completely
gone
finishes
dry
and
quick
not
much
else
to
say
about
it
really
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
for
a
beer
like
this
it
is
probably
a
good
thing
the
flavor
leaves
the
palate
so
fast
out
of
a
can
this
beer
was
a
twentyfour
carat
gold
color
with
some
nice
rising
carbonation
the
two
finger
beige
head
retained
rather
poorly
and
the
lacing
was
good
at
first
though
it
left
only
tiny
bands
later
the
aroma
was
of
macro
grains
pale
malt
crystal
malty
alcohol
and
aluminum
the
flavors
were
bland
stale
and
dominated
by
macro
grains
with
some
pale
malt
a
slight
sourness
metal
sweet
malt
and
some
bitterness
of
herbal
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
rough
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
high
im
going
to
go
hug
my
penguins
now
i
have
a
rookery
and
try
to
forget
that
this
debacle
ever
took
place
very
plain
on
the
tongue
and
drinks
just
like
water
should
err
the
appearance
was
a
crystal
clear
bright
gold
with
no
lacing
the
smell
was
funky
mildly
sweet
and
skunky
the
taste
wasnt
awful
a
toosmall
kiss
of
hops
followed
up
with
a
tiny
bite
from
some
alcoholic
sweetness
that
gets
buried
in
an
avalanche
of
corn
flavor
until
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
it
serves
this
beer
well
cause
you
could
pound
these
things
but
theyll
catch
up
with
you
soon
because
there
seems
to
be
more
alcohol
than
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
yuck
the
beers
body
is
slightly
more
than
watery
so
this
is
what
the
water
from
the
millcreak
is
like
the
drinkability
for
me
is
shot
due
to
stinging
carbonation
verdict
lets
do
a
mental
exercise
i
want
you
to
imagine
a
bottle
of
bud
light
with
a
percent
more
alcohol
and
perhaps
a
little
more
grainy
malt
can
you
see
it
there
now
ive
saved
you
from
ever
bothering
to
try
this
bleh
drinking
this
beer
was
mildly
pleasurable
there
was
no
strong
aftertaste
or
harsh
alcohol
flavor
but
there
wasnt
much
flavor
at
all
it
goes
down
well
but
just
seemed
to
be
too
much
on
the
lighter
side
and
yes
it
is
remarkably
easy
to
drink
good
show
ab
i
rather
like
it
drinkability
doobydoobydoo
not
altogether
horrendous
when
it
comes
to
these
adjunctladen
macros
ill
take
mild
and
smooth
over
harsh
and
sickly
any
day
of
the
week
24oz

pale

yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
of
foam
that
dissolves
into
a
light
collar
surprisingly
little
carbonation
hardly
any
bubble
action
going
on
aroma
is
of
stale
wet
cardboard
and
overcooked
rotten
veggies
taste
is
weak
and
watery
rice
water
to
be
exact
kind
of
a
bitter
sour
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
fizzy
drinkability
would
be
higher
if
it
had
any
flavor
to
it
this
wasnt
even
worth
the
1
50
i
paid
for
it
the
only
redeeming
factor
is
that
the
higher
alcohol
content
means
itll
get
ya
drunk
when
you
really
think
about
it
isnt
that
the
only
reason
anyone
drinks
this
crap
bud
ice
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
looks
a
little
shitty
an
smells
a
little
weird
but
other
then
that
it
doesnt
really
taste
that
bad
but
it
has
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
watered
down
sensation
its
very
light
and
very
easy
to
pound
away
and
the
5
5
abv
isnt
that
bad
overall
very
good
party
beer
and
hot
summer
day
beer
wow
this
is
a
whole
bottle
of
suck
the
only
beer
below
this
one
is
beer
30
ice
beer
is
just
a
terrible
concept
and
should
be
purged
from
any
brewers
mind
nothing
good
about
color
taste
or
head
not
to
mention
being
seen
with
a
bud
ice
is
very
unattractive
ice
beer
has
only
one
quality
they
sacrifice
flavor
for
alcohol
content
if
youre
just
looking
to
get
drunk
you
might
have
a
problem
so
its
down
to
bud
ice
i
still
cant
understand
why
the
guys
at
ab
would
still
put
something
in
a
clear
bottle
can
they
not
have
the
icecuby
bottle
made
in
brown
or
would
it
just
look
like
it
was
covered
in
little
boxes
or
something
anyway
this
pours
completely
clear
and
yellow
with
not
much
of
a
head
at
all
little
more
alcohol
than
its
regular
non
ice
brother
and
a
little
more
pronounce
of
a
corn
flavor
overall
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
not
exactly
for
the
connoisseur
or
pretty
much
anyone
with
a
discriminating
palate
at
all
for
that
matter
as
far
as
good
things
the
blue
can
looks
cool
i
pick
up
something
like
this
once
and
a
while
just
to
try
it
and
rate
it
a
pale
golden
pour
with
a
thin
fizzy
headnot
much
of
an
aromaslightly
corny
maybe
something
that
resembled
pale
maltlots
of
lively
carbonation
i
must
have
been
really
thirsty
or
this
was
ultra
freshbecause
it
has
kind
of
a
fruity
dimly
hoppy
flavordry
finish
not
bad
for
1
99
i
dont
think
i
would
run
out
and
buy
this
again
but
i
would
drink
it
again
out
of
a
tallboy
can
i
now
refuse
to
buy
a
bottle
colored
anything
but
dark
brown
pours
darker
than
a
usual
american
macro
pale
lager
no
skunk
smell
thank
god
but
not
much
else
there
either
a
little
on
the
pour
and
nothing
afterwards
not
much
of
a
taste
here
a
little
more
than
bud
light
a
little
less
than
budweiser
really
nothing
to
it
but
it
is
refreshing
in
the
same
way
water
is
not
as
much
carbonation
as
some
other
beers
even
the
blue
moon
i
had
last
night
i
marked
down
more
for
excess
carbonation
for
what
it
is
it
aint
bad
but
in
the
whole
spectrum
of
things
its
trash
just
like
the
rest
of
the
american
macro
pales
i
have
a
smuttynose
ipa
to
try
after
this
so
this
is
really
just
a
warmup
brew
for
me
on
a
friday
night
d
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
you
could
probably
only
drink
a
few
of
these
before
the
5
5
sneaks
up
on
you
and
slaps
you
in
the
face
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
nothing
to
foul
or
offensive
about
it
which
is
good
and
for
1
50
a
32oz
plus
5
5
abv
that
makes
it
an
easy
to
drink
kick
back
get
a
buzz
beer
its
a
decent
adjunct
lager
but
a
little
one
profile
and
boring
id
still
say
give
it
a
try
sometime
when
your
low
on
cash
overall
yeah
in
its
time
and
place
serve
this
one
cold
as
possible
and
enjoy
the
benefits
of
the
5
5
abv
i
purchased
a
12
pack
of
bottles
for
sale
at
9
99
not
too
shabby
i
was
surprised
to
notice
that
i
havent
reviewed
this
beer
yet
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
not
much
aroma
some
barley
and
hops
the
taste
was
very
sweet
and
metallic
water
texture
and
very
carbonated
from
my
previous
experiences
with
ice
beers
i
was
pleasentaly
suprised
not
bad
overall
but
the
taste
was
was
not
quite
there
to
make
it
a
hot
day
beer
d
drinkability
was
uneventful
even
for
a
light
lawnmower
beer
cold
stale
and
was
like
licking
a
cold
steel
beam
at
times
the
one
thing
good
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
a
normal
budweiser
its
like
the
baby
of
coors
and
bud
light
poured
a
piss
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
fizzhead
that
disapeared
quickly
some
alcohol
in
the
smell
with
a
little
sweetness
tastes
like
carbonated
corn
water
metalic
booze
taste
also
feel
is
highly
carbonated
and
crisp
without
alot
going
on
i
cant
wait
to
go
to
my
cousins
house
and
bring
him
a
case
of
this
swill
golden
colored
not
quite
as
pale
looking
as
some
other
swill
some
head
and
a
little
retention
so
it
looks
a
little
better
than
standard
swill
doesnt
taste
any
better
i
feel
ive
said
this
before
malty
corn
grains
semiskunked
offensive
taste
no
thanks
d
not
a
horrible
macro
but
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
wont
buy
again
when
pbr
is
50
cents
less
mouthfeel
is
crisp
dry
highly
carbonated
not
amazing
in
the
least
just
a
poor
offering
wouldnt
disrespect
food
by
drinking
this
an
absolutely
must
avoid
id
rather
reach
for
a
water
if
given
the
choice
eww
ive
only
had
one
of
these
in
my
life
and
that
was
enough
i
barely
like
bud
products
as
is
average
light
beer
taste
if
not
more
watered
down
it
seems
despite
the
higher
abv
i
think
it
is
just
a
marketing
ploy
to
get
more
people
to
buy
it
i
just
say
splurge
the
extra
pennies
on
a
better
product
at
least
bud
light
if
you
prefer
bud
products
or
better
in
my
opinion
miller
products
all
in
all
avoid
unless
your
dirt
broke
in
that
case
give
it
a
shot
i
suppose
haha
d
a
pretty
subpar
beer
overall
but
at
least
is
mostly
unoffensive
the
sweetness
inherent
in
this
and
most
other
ice
beers
really
lower
the
drinkability
no
doubt
before
i
get
through
this
24
oz
can
i
will
find
it
sickeningly
cloying
purchased
cheap
just
to
do
the
review
wanted
to
compare
to
molson
ice
there
is
no
comparison
apparently
d
quite
possibly
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
no
hops
no
maltiness
not
even
a
little
sweet
it
reminds
me
of
a
movie
beer
you
know
a
completely
generic
labeled
beer
that
just
says
beer
on
the
label
d
the
only
reason
i
drank
this
stuff
was
because
its
cheap
and
has
a
5
5
abv
presentation
packaged
in
a
40ounce
clear
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
very
bland
a
sweeter
than
typical
macro
the
5
alcohol
is
part
of
the
gimmick
not
much
higher
abv
but
the
alcohol
i
assume
is
whats
lending
its
higher
sweetness
than
normal
for
the
style
i
had
to
force
it
down
as
its
rather
unpleasant
there
are
much
better
ice
beers
and
macros
out
there
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
nice
head
initially
but
dwindles
down
to
a
lace
the
smell
is
just
adjuncts
and
nothing
else
taste
is
not
too
bad
but
tastes
watery
for
5
5
abv
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
is
moderately
carbonated
there
taste
is
not
overloaded
with
adjuncts
like
you
might
expect
i
tried
to
keep
style
in
mind
when
reviewing
this
one
and
its
a
pretty
good
ice
beer
and
i
definitely
like
it
better
than
regular
bud
dont
expect
too
much
from
this
beer
but
its
not
the
worst
thing
out
there
either
drinkability
was
smooth
and
easy
though
the
beer
got
alittle
boring
by
cans
end
although
there
are
some
passable
cheap
swills
this
is
not
one
of
them
yucko
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
worst
in
the
bud
family
the
color
is
a
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
old
grains
and
grass
the
flavor
profile
is
really
bland
with
a
corny
bitterness
the
body
is
extremely
light
yet
this
one
is
still
hard
for
me
to
take
down
it
is
about
as
filling
as
a
regular
budweiser
and
has
a
mild
sweet
taste
but
not
enough
to
ruin
the
beer
flavor
well
rated
fairly
its
not
as
bad
as
some
ive
had
i
dont
like
the
style
though
so
i
wont
buy
it
again
d
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
more
than
24oz
of
just
doesnt
hold
my
interest
i
appreciate
a
decent
ice
beer
but
this
is
not
eisbock
i
am
not
impressed
to
say
the
least
this
is
best
used
as
a
palate
cleanser
i
generally
i
am
not
a
fan
of
fizzy
and
yellow
but
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
bud
if
pressed
i
say
avoid
this
it
isnt
worth
the
time
or
bladder
space
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beer
experiences
ive
ever
had
not
the
worst
but
damn
close
avoid
indeed
d
meh
its
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
but
if
push
comes
to
shove
i
would
drink
it
again
granted
i
have
not
had
it
from
the
clear
bottle
but
overall
its
not
a
terrible
ice
brew
nothing
extraordinary
but
palatable
in
highschool
this
was
my
beer
of
choice
well
this
or
red
dog
says
a
lot
for
my
tastes
back
then
doesnt
it
i
used
to
pound
these
back
and
remember
preferring
this
to
the
taste
of
the
budweiser
i
now
realise
that
i
was
horribly
mistaken
on
the
taste
what
the
hell
was
i
thinking
smells
like
skunky
vegetable
tastes
much
the
same
this
is
foul
and
awful
stuff
avoid
at
all
costs
basically
its
water
with
an
aftertaste
of
skunked
malt
a
clear
golden
body
that
has
nothing
but
a
light
alcohol
and
airy
smell
it
tastes
like
a
tart
budweiser
which
isnt
as
bad
as
that
sounds
but
there
is
a
horrible
aftertaste
and
it
leaves
me
even
more
thirsty
maybe
thats
how
they
get
people
to
keep
drinking
this
after
splitting
a
6pack
with
my
friend
mike
i
not
only
didnt
want
to
keep
drinking
this
stuff
i
was
done
drinking
for
the
night
if
you
want
cheap
this
is
the
beer
to
go
with
this
and
the
light
ice
beer
they
make
i
cannot
seem
to
find
this
beer
anymore
as
if
i
am
trying
but
overall
it
is
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
from
ab
i
would
recomend
this
beer
to
any
college
student
trying
to
get
drunk
cheap
drinkability
not
very
drinkable
at
all
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
a
lessthanspectacular
offering
from
the
famous
budweiser
company
this
is
a
slightly
stronger
beer
than
other
budweiser
products
but
where
it
scores
for
strength
it
lacks
in
flavor
and
character
a
resoundingly
oily
taste
has
you
feeling
like
your
drinking
petroleum
rather
than
a
worldclass
brew
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
beer
unless
i
was
trying
to
get
really
tipsy
for
as
cheap
as
i
possibly
could
definitely
not
worth
a
try
unless
youre
willing
to
part
with
a
1
09
to
try
24
ounces
of
a
liquid
that
might
as
well
have
been
pumped
out
of
your
local
texaco
the
taste
has
light
notes
of
malt
corn
and
even
smaller
hop
character
very
bland
its
almost
like
drinking
lightly
flavoured
water
i
cant
say
much
more
than
that
other
than
im
pouring
the
rest
down
the
drain
another
crappy
pale
lager
from
the
folks
at
anheuserbusch
again
pours
pale
yellow
with
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
except
for
the
smell
of
adjunct
the
higher
alcohol
content
is
evident
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
about
the
same
as
bud
but
this
beer
has
less
drinkability
probably
wont
have
this
again
moldy
stale
cooked
veggies
gritty
woody
and
ropey
taste
just
a
stronger
bud

and
at
only
5
5
what
a
waste
of
a
bottle
clear
one
at
that
maybe
a
light
striking
would
help
this
crap
if
i
could
give
this
beer
all
0s
i
would
this
was
once
a
staple
of
mine
in
high
school
just
because
of
the
price
but
i
went
back
to
this
recently
just
to
relive
some
good
ol
days
and
yuck
the
color
goes
along
with
the
yellowish
tint
of
most
american
brews
but
the
smell
was
horrific
smelled
like
rice
and
the
taste
was
just
as
horrible
i
cant
even
describe
it
never
agian
will
i
drink
this
or
even
allow
somone
to
drink
this
pours
a
clear
yellowish
color
seemingly
typical
with
a
nice
head
at
least
aroma
is
of
adjuncts
and
nothing
impressive
to
me
taste
is
much
of
the
sameexcept
that
it
reminds
me
somewhat
of
budweiser
but
stronger
not
much
else
to
say
except
that
its
good
if
you
like
a
cheap
buzz
steel
reserve
was
more
impressive
and
molson
canadian
lager
is
much
better
as
well
did
i
mention
the
alcohol
burrrp
d
pretty
good
for
an
ice
beer
ill
take
this
over
regular
bud
any
day
at
least
its
not
watered
down
when
this
came
out
i
was
13
maybe
i
was
seduced
by
the
advertising
more
alcohol
less
flavor
hell
yeah
had
this
more
times
than
i
care
to
remember
as
a
kid
this
beer
really
delivered
on
its
promise
a
full
51
more
abv
and
even
less
flavor
than
other
macro
lagers
how
was
this
even
possible
i
probably
owe
getting
laid
a
few
times
to
the
utter
lack
of
taste
in
this
beer
yeah
pretty
much
one
of
those
run
of
the
mill
american
beers
which
i
personally
enjoy
taste
is
your
normal
domestic
lager
decent
flavor
and
feel
until
the
last
2
watery
gulps
has
a
little
bit
more
of
a
kick
like
most
ice
beers
do
for
the
money
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
at
times
when
your
stash
is
low
bud
ice
was
a
pale
yellow
color
and
very
clear
it
had
a
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
a
ring
with
only
a
touch
of
lace
there
was
not
much
at
all
going
on
the
aroma
department
the
taste
was
grainy
and
not
at
all
pleasing
it
was
light
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
not
very
good
either
and
this
beer
is
not
recommended
overall
decent
overall
a
decent
choice
for
those
looking
for
a
slightly
higher
abv
offering
of
their
favorite
macro
swill
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
like
plank
road
brewery
if
your
looking
for
a
beer
to
sip
and
marvel
at
taste
with
this
isnt
it
but
if
you
dont
feel
like
spending
much
money
and
want
to
start
off
the
day
mowing
the
lawn
with
a
brew
dag
then
this
one
is
good
enough
only
a
decent
taste
at
first
but
after
a
few
and
you
will
start
to
like
the
taste
a
little
more
its
decent
for
your
domestic
macro
brewery
the
taste
is
well
bud
macro
grains
and
rice
a
sour
fizzy
finish
and
maybe
a
hint
stronger
than
regular
bud
mouthfeel
is
thin
carbonated
drinkability
no
thanks
i
honestly
drank
it
because
my
friend
had
nothing
else
this
is
bad
even
for
macros
id
rather
drink
bud
light
at
least
that
has
less
flavor
the
beer
was
another
pale
straw
yellow
macro
color
with
a
you
guessed
it
small
head
of
white
foam
that
just
dissipated
away
in
a
matter
of
a
nanosecond
the
aroma
was
that
of
ice
with
some
rice
in
the
background
can
ice
be
an
aroma
it
is
if
youre
talking
about
this
beer
taste
you
might
get
a
miniature
amount
of
ice
rice
and
other
grains
one
time
i
thought
i
had
tasted
some
juicy
fruits
in
this
but
i
could
have
been
day
dreaming
at
the
time
there
was
no
mouthfeel
unless
you
count
drinking
water
as
something
i
dont
so
no
if
its
the
cheapest
beer
at
a
bar
and
i
dont
feel
like
spending
extra
for
a
better
beer
then
i
would
give
it
another
go
it
would
make
a
good
alternative
if
bottled
water
prices
would
skyrocket
through
the
roof
drinkability
not
very
drinkable
at
all
i
do
not
recommend
this
ice
beer
there
are
better
ones
out
there
this
beer
is
right
in
line
with
the
style
really
as
far
as
mass
produced
brews
go
most
are
similar
i
bought
this
tonight
for
the
ride
home
no
need
to
worry
i
was
riding
shotgun
theres
just
something
about
a
nice
tall
boy
in
a
paper
sack
on
a
country
backroad
after
dark
this
beer
is
fine
for
that
actually
i
dont
think
you
would
want
to
redneck
it
too
much
with
a
barleywine
a
lighter
beer
in
a
sack
serves
this
purpose
pretty
good
the
drinkability
of
ok
good
for
a
hot
day
when
you
cant
find
good
water
or
you
have
had
too
much
water
mk
get
my
buzz
on
n
bud
ice
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
froma
clear
faceted
twelve
ounce
bottle
smell
is
grainy
the
taste
is
also
grainy
maybe
some
cooked
vegetabe
flavors
with
a
very
clean
finish
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
sweetness
nothing
too
offensive
yet
not
worth
looking
for
this
beer
is
a
little
stronger
than
regular
budweiser
but
it
is
only
one
half
percentage
point
higher
so
dont
let
this
fact
scare
you
away
from
trying
bud
ice
the
bland
boring
taste
is
enough
reason
not
to
waste
your
time
it
stands
as
yet
another
example
of
a
below
average
ice
brewed
beer
average
macro
and
much
better
than
a
lot
of
anheuserbuschs
brews
if
you
like
malty
macros
with
a
slight
kick
try
one
otherwise
it
seems
pretty
much
the
same
its
sweet
like
bud
without
becoming
cloying
and
still
offers
the
signature
yeastiness
of
a
kiss
of
light
apple
its
fairly
wellbalanced
and
surprisingly
drinkable
while
cold
drinkability
definately
drinkable
and
a
better
choice
than
most
lowestrung
macros
definetely
should
suffice
for
college
parties
could
use
more
flavor
though
this
beer
is
more
refined
than
lesser
ice
beers
and
could
possible
be
one
of
the
best
ice
beers
i
tried
comperable
to
icehouse
possibly
it
looks
like
what
you
would
expect
from
an
american
macro
lager
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
faint
the
taste
has
an
akwardly
sweet
bready
flavor
almost
reminds
me
of
a
cinnamon
roll
nothing
that
reminds
me
of
beer
not
even
bad
beer
huh
i
wonder
if
my
taste
buds
are
off
today
or
if
bud
ice
always
tastes
this
unusual
pretty
lame
it
gets
better
after
a
few
but
it
doesnt
ever
get
good
i
guess
its
worth
it
if
your
looking
to
catch
a
good
buzz
but
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
else
to
offer
pours
a
color
kin
to
concentrated
urine
or
apple
juice
to
be
polite
forms
a
white
overly
carbonated
head
leaves
thin
lacing
smells
of
cereal
grains
clean
overall
touch
of
chemically
engineered
hop
aroma
and
evident
alcohol
with
that
whopping
5
increase
in
abv
flavors
more

pretty
much

folks
drinkability
well
when
drinking
in
my
hometown
there
are
limited
options
i
figured
i
should
sneak
a
review
in
not
reaching
for
another
anytime
soon
poured
from
12oz
bottle
to
pint
glass
creating
one
inch
head
shortlived
yellow
straw
color
absolutely
clear
with
no
cloudiness
smell
is
very
processed
im
not
sure
how
to
put
my
finger
on
it
just
super
clean
and
processed
like
most
all
other
macro
brew
lagers
this
is
especially
true
with
this
brew
the
taste
to
be
really
honest
its
fun
its
tacky
you
know
what
youre
getting
from
the
beginning
and
it
does
the
job
well
it
may
be
watered
down
it
may
not
have
the
hops
or
the
malt
characters
to
set
it
apart
from
well
anything
but
what
i
found
to
be
the
attractive
aspect
was
just
being
fun
to
drink
like
watching
cops
or
jerry
springer
almost
you
feel
like
white
trash
but
hey
its
fun
right
its
refreshing
and
crisp
and
you
can
take
out
a
lot
in
one
sitting
so
points
for
that
poured
a
plae
yellow
crystal
clear
color
with
large
white
puffy
head
smell
is
minimal
but
not
unpleasant
being
maily
of
a
slightly
sweetish
character
taste
is
also
very
mild
with
a
slight
maltiness
and
no
hops
finishes
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
with
rapidly
disappearing
flavor
good
spacer
but
a
little
too
high
alcohol
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
clean
and
crisp
pale
malt
and
adjunct
scent
that
is
a
bit
husky
and
dry
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
is
dry
and
musty
with
a
light
pale
malt
flavor
as
well
as
a
clean
finish
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
slightly
skunky
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
macro
lager
there
is
little
flavor
and
almost
no
aroma
but
it
drinks
well
the
bonus
with
ice
beers
is
the
quicker
buzz
its
the
only
bright
side
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
fullon
vanishes
after
about
1
minute
serious
carbonation
just
keeps
on
coming
fizzy
fizzy
beer
not
much
to
the
nose
besides
some
adjunct
malt
and
a
touch
of
astringency
the
palate
follows
theres
just
not
much
to
it
a
bit
of
adjunct
malt
some
light
honeyish
sweetness
body
is
very
fizzy
i
will
say
this
its
easy
to
put
back
a
lot
of
this
stuff
still
its
just
not
a
very
good
experience
pass
on
it
this
beer
has
a
similar
taste
or
lack
thereof
of
bud
light
but
with
more
graininess
and
bite
in
the
sides
and
back
of
the
toung
less
malt
sweetness
and
hop
character
than
most
macro
brews
highly
carbonated
and
slightly
increased
alcohol
masks
the
flavors
and
numbs
the
palate
graininess
is
left
in
the
aftertaste
and
not
much
else
i
dont
know
why
but
ab
products
usually
give
me
an
instant
headache
after
a
mere
sip
or
two
thankfully
this
one
did
not
unfortunately
it
brought
upon
a
wicked
stomach
ache
about
halfway
through
the
brew
instead
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
two
finger
head
that
will
vanish
completely
in
less
than
20
seconds
and
leave
no
lacing
typical
budweiser
faint
rice
and
grain
smell
with
some
apple
ester
harsh
grain
and
fusel
aftertaste
a
more
fuller
body
than
expected
of
an
american
macro
and
only
slightly
crisp
ice
has
the
addition
of
a
sweeter
malt
liquor
flavor
and
mouthfeel
goes
down
hard
but
at
least
there
is
something
to
taste
besides
adjunct
i
give
a
bonus
point
for
the
bottle
design
they
used
clear
glass
but
it
is
still
one
of
the
very
most
creative
design
for
a
us
macro
i
saw
drinkability
im
not
sure
why
i
used
to
like
this
stuff
back
in
college
i
think
its
because
it
was
different
had
a
cool
bottle
and
had
more
alcohol
now
that
i
drink
for
taste
i
doubt
ill
ever
buy
this
beer
again
theres
nothing
to
this
beer
except
a
bottle
full
of
brewing
shortcuts
wow
i
didnt
think
ab
could
brew
a
beer
worse
than
bud
light
12
oz
born
on
4805
served
ice
cold
in
a
mug
pours
an
extremely
fizzy
pissyellow
with
a
2
finger
head
that
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
a
seminice
aroma
while
pouring
but
afterward
it
is
lots
of
metal
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
skunk
im
wincing
at
the
thought
of
drinking
this
i
tasted
absolutely
nothing
on
the
first
sip
by
the
end
there
is
a
trace
of
malts
and
hops
but
this
is
essentially
yellow
carbonated
water
with
some
alcohol
hard
to
finish
this
one
i
couldnt
even
imagine
making
this
a
session
beer
pale
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
bubbling
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
big
fizzy
head
at
first
and
then
nothing
buy
a
thin
lace
after
that
smells
clean
with
some
cooked
corn
the
mouth
feel
is
thin
with
a
sizzle
on
the
tounge
from
the
carbonation
the
taste
is
waterdown
with
a
cooked
grain
and
light
hoppiness
watery
aftertaste
there
is
really
no
point
in
this
beer
but
a
cheap
buzz
but
i
must
say
i
have
had
much
worse
well
it
is
yellow
and
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
head
there
isnt
any
aroma
to
speak
of
so
i
wasnt
offended
by
the
aroma
but
there
was
nothing
to
like
about
the
aroma
either
flavor
is
pretty
bland
as
well
some
grain
flavor
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
but
not
much
going
on
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
good
thick
for
the
style
theres
a
lot
of
better
macro
lagers
out
there
but
there
are
also
alot
worse
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
very
close
sample
16
at
radekfest
05
to
change
the
pace
no
colour
high
liquor
smell
taste
of
grass
and
lemon
in
water
left
a
long
time
with
cheap
soda
water
not
quaffable
keep
it
very
cold
like
vodka
on
second
thought
have
a
vodka
this
beer
appeared
in
my
fridge
for
some
reason
i
swear
i
didnt
buy
it
i
poured
this
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
duvel
glass
because
i
thought
the
incongruity
might
be
funny
this
glass
usually
holds
a
head
very
well
but
the
head
on
this
beer
was
gone
in
seconds
leaving
an
unattactive
pale
yellow
liquid
in
my
glass
there
is
a
hint
of
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
terrible
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
with
nasty
off
flavors
and
no
hops
i
did
not
find
this
beer
to
be
easy
to
drink

too
bubbly
enjoy
rrrr
in
the
end
it
all
comes
down
to
preference
neither
one
of
these
is
particularly
good
beer
but
i
do
like
the
natural
ice
better
because
i
feel
that
the
mild
sweetness
improves
the
flavor
slightly
and
improves
the
body
to
some
extent
the
extra
sugar
might
also
limit
drinkability
if
one
chose
to
pound
more
than
a
few
but
ill
never
be
drunk
enough
to
do
something
so
stupid
this
side
by
side
comparison
was
more
than
enough
thank
you
overall
a
step
above
natty
ice
a
smooth
beer
to
get
drunk
quick
and
have
fun
with
your
frat
brothers
in
terms
of
taste
and
hops
and
many
other
factors
it
leaves
much
to
be
desired
but
for
a
smooth
quick
buzz
go
here
for
just
about
any
other
occasion
pick
something
else
if
youre
going
to
drink
cheap
beer
you
may
as
well
drink
this
shit
the
beer
as
it
sallies
forth
from
the
12ounce
clear
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
faded
gold
color
with
a
moderate
frothy
head
that
is
white
in
color
and
the
residual
lace
a
thin
sheet
to
seal
off
the
glass
nose
is
typical
lager
crisp
and
clean
with
the
start
somewhat
sweet
and
the
grain
profile
weak
top
is
cadaverous
in
feel
finish
is
stinging
in
its
acidity
the
hops
meek
and
the
aftertaste
dry
as
a
desert
bone
been
a
little
over
four
years
since
i
sampled
this
beer
and
as
i
like
to
review
beers
on
occasion
this
one
i
should
have
missed
drinkablility
in
the
can
must
be
a
little
less
than
in
the
bottle
yeah
it
was
a
good
cold
macro
beer
but
the
ab
flavor
is
one
i
dont
care
for
anymore
the
color
is
mild
yellow
as
you
can
see
through
the
clear
bottle
we
bought
this
back
in
college
because
the
bottle
looked
kind
of
cool
well
to
a
college
kid
it
did
i
dont
get
hangovers
but
i
could
feel
one
coming
on
after
just
half
a
bottle
of
this
too
much
carbonation
combined
with
a
sweet
but
not
too
satisfying
flavor
that
alcohol
taste
you
get
with
high
gravity
lagers
such
as
camo
and
steel
reserve
211
follows
almost
immediately
after
the
initial
taste
yes
that
taste
that
seems
like
somebody
dropped
a
really
bad
shot
of
vodka
into
your
beer
i
would
pass
on
this
beer
instant
hangover
in
a
bottle
drinkability
too
carbonated
for
me
the
bubbles
will
catch
up
to
you
in
the
morning
if
you
make
a
session
of
these
not
bad
just
not
my
style
even
if
i
am
feeling
effects
after
one
24ouncer
a
heavy
pour
and
got
a
threefingered
white
head
that
faded
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
no
lace
clear
golden
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
light
bodied
starts
with
a
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
maybe
thats
what
gives
it
some
flavor
better
than
a
regular
budweiser
but
really
just
a
good
lawnmower
beer
1
25
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
i
could
drink
more
of
this
than
some
others
like
regular
budweiser
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
if
i
could
avoid
it
it
goes
down
smooth
though
in
high
school
this
is
what
the
kids
would
get
in
40s
in
order
to
get
drunk
really
fast
so
if
youre
a
high
schooler
or
any
other
type
of
lowlife
alcoholic
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
otherwise
steer
clear
this
beer
tastes
bad
but
bad
taste
coupled
with
memories
make
for
a
truely
heinous
beer
this
beer
is
yellower
than
the
darkest
piss
i
ever
seen
this
beer
has
but
1
purpose
to
get
you
drunk
the
fastest
and
leave
you
hung
over
like
ted
kennedy
the
taste
is
there
and
then
its
not
but
when
it
is
there
its
not
good
this
visions
of
my
friends
brother
uninating
in
public
shouting
racial
slurs
threatening
to
kill
people
shooting
fireworks
at
buildings
engaging
in
rediculos
conversation
and
making
statements
that
would
make
president
clinton
blush
have
tainted
my
feelings
about
this
beer
even
moreso
than
the
bad
flavor
stupid
bottle
can
i
have
to
admit
i
dont
like
ab
products
all
that
much
but
this
one
hit
a
note
in
me
strong
overtones
of
corn
hops
and
alcohol
this
brew
went
down
very
smoothly
to
my
suprise
short
aftertaste
of
hops
and
medium
carbonation
are
the
highlights
of
this
beer
a
good
entry
level
brew
for
those
looking
to
try
an
ice
beer
taste
was
more
than
i
was
expecting
more
corn
maybe
wait
its
the
alcohol
nothing
offensive
about
this
other
than
the
company
who
makes
it
bland
after
so
many
ice
beers
died
id
be
curious
to
see
where
they
sell
this
one
well
drinkability
is
acceptable
tastes
better
than
it
should
it
is
budweiser
concentrated
to
the
point
of
actual
flavor
not
a
good
beer
even
if
you
get
it
cheap
when
i
give
it
a
high
rating
in
appearance
i
only
meant
because
of
the
cool
bottle
it
was
in
other
then
that
it
was
very
light
and
almost
tasted
to
me
like
some
really
flat
budweiser
im
not
too
crazy
about
this
beer
it
is
decent
but
another
not
so
good
anheuiserbusch
product
id
still
drink
if
however
if
nothing
else
was
available
light
gold
color
with
a
tiny
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
corn
and
cereal
tastes
sweet
and
grainy
with
almost
no
trace
of
hops
a
little
malt
flavor
it
is
a
little
stronger
than
budweiser
so
i
would
get
this
instead
you
have
to
drink
less
of
it
its
drinkable
but
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
paycheck
next
week
this
has
been
a
sobering
expierience
which
has
taught
me
to
always
go
with
quality
over
quantity
this
is
easily
the
most
drinkable
ice
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
did
not
have
much
flavor
to
srart
out
with
other
than
grain
and
corn
but
the
taste
was
smoothe
and
not
to
intrusive
this
is
definantly
a
beer
to
get
wasted
on
and
not
to
seriously
drink
bud
dry
is
much
better
as
far
as
an
ab
beer
goes
but
if
i
were
you
id
stick
to
the
sierra
nevadas
or
stones
of
the
world
if
you
want
new
exciting
beers
cheerz
it
is
hard
to
find
anything
to
criticize
about
bud
ice
simply
because
there
is
so
little
flavor
it
is
hard
for
seltzer
to
be
offensive
so
processed
was
this
beer
that
it
retained
very
little
beer
qualities
thin
a
touch
of
malt
and
hops
and
that
is
pretty
much
it
it
made
the
strohs
i
had
been
drinking
look
like
an
ipa
even
when
an
insipid
beer
fits
the
bill
this
one
cant
measure
up
comments

sorry
for
the
short
review
but
this
one
was
uninspiring
to
say
the
least
causing
a
severe
case
of
writers
block
i
dont
know
what
to
say

it
was
blah

sure
its
nothing
grand
but
it
shouldnt
be
on
the
50
worst
beers
i
like
this
one
on
a
cheap
night
when
i
have
hardly
any
money
since
i
am
in
college
i
dont
usually
drink
to
get
drunk
because
it
is
rather
barberic
but
if
you
wanna
do
it
for
cheap
this
is
the
way
to
go
the
smell
is
pretty
basic
but
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
the
taste
it
simialr
nothing
else
needs
to
be
said
notes
dont
drink
i
guess
if
i
was
hot
and
thirsty
it
would
be
a
tossup
between
this
and
a
bottle
of
water
otherwise
i
wouldnt
bother
i
actually
like
this
more
than
other
bud
products
because
it
doesnt
have
any
of
that
horrid
cornriceweak
hops
flavor
im
still
not
sure
why
i
felt
like
watching
nascar
while
drinking
this
pours
a
yellow
straw
amber
with
a
white
head
tastes
almost
like
a
generic
bud
but
not
quite
it
has
that
grain
thing
going
on
with
that
sweetness
and
that
well
stop
this
is
really
a
nothing
tasting
beer
why
fight
it
one
of
the
worst
ice
brews
out
there
drinkable
maybe
but
there
are
many
better
ice
brews
out
there
i
just
keep
trying
to
find
an
ab
brew
that
doesnt
taste
the
same
as
bud
one
of
the
beers
i
just
cant
find
a
way
to
like
the
look
smell
amd
marketing
are
all
formula
standard
completely
the
picture
is
that
hateful
bud
taste
with
all
that
worst
grain
sense
how
can
i
review
a
beer
so
horrible
its
macrogarbage
at
its
worst
i
dont
even
care
to
think
about
how
bad
this
is
one
taste
will
tell
you
damn
what
am
i
thinking
and
drinking
stick
to
water
as
with
all
ab
products
it
doesnt
matter
which
beer
it
is
dry
ice
original
or
light
they
are
all
lousy
and
of
poor
quality
and
that
born
on
date
doesnt
matter
if
you
drank
it
from
the
brewery
itself
the
body
is
a
watery
coppergolden
color
with
absolutely
no
head
smells
of
sugary
malts
and
rice
come
to
the
nose
tatse
is
the
same
but
extremely
light
extremely
dry
finish
and
very
watery
and
thin
body
but
if
you
can
drink
hard
water
you
can
drink
this
hohum
acceptable
brew
but
nothing
more
good
colour
and
has
a
nice
glass
cling
but
taste
is
marginal
and
the
body
is
a
bit
heavy
well
balanced
but
leaves
you
lacking
dry
after
taste
is
persistant
i
would
not
recomend
this
brew
to
anyone
without
a
brown
paper
bag
small
bubbly
head
whitish
awful
retention
some
lace
light
ambergolden
hue
indistinguishable
nose
nothing
at
all
way
too
clean
bafflingly
plain
taste
very
faint
hints
of
sweetness
coupled
with
equally
difficult
to
detect
bitterness
harsh
yet
watery
the
sweetness
inflames
as
it
warms
unsophisticated
designed
for
a
quick
buzz
not
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
skip
it
not
recommended
at
all
not
a
good
choice
for
drinking
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
your
mouth
stick
with
bud
when
you
want
to
get
drunk
this
is
what
you
drink
tastes
like
piss
but
goes
down
easy
a
real
party
beer
but
thats
it
kind
of
scary
that
i
once
associated
with
people
who
thought
this
was
the
best
stuff
out
there
hey
atleast
the
commercials
were
great
a
cheap
beer
popular
in
high
school
and
college
parties
a
little
higher
in
alcohol
than
the
other
american
beers
to
me
that
rice
brewing
is
just
not
right
it
is
almost
unbearable
to
smell
let
alone
drink
nose
is
a
chemical
bitter
mix
with
some
cloy
sweet
notes
that
would
gag
a
maggot
so
its
better
to
drink
this
stuff
than
to
use
it
as
an
after
shave
if
youve
got
to
drink
it
then
just
drink
it
smelling
it
is
not
an
option
this
is
my
fathers
version
of
a
heavy
beer
so
he
usually
has
some
around
when
i
go
visit
him
it
does
have
an
attractive
pale
yellow
color
unlike
some
other
macros
that
look
too
yellow
for
my
tastes
because
they
remind
me
of
urine
it
did
have
a
slight
aroma
that
was
pleasant
but
faint
the
taste
is
barely
drinkable
after
it
warms
even
a
touch
so
drink
it
cold
if
you
must
drink
it
feels
like
carbonated
water
and
the
aftertaste
prevents
me
from
drinking
very
many
of
them
often
times
i
pass
on
them
when
dad
offers
in
college
we
used
to
say
any
beer
is
better
than
no
beer
im
not
sure
i
can
say
that
today
this
is
what
you
want
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
it
taste
like
piss
but
goes
down
fairly
easy
and
makes
a
great
party
beer
that
is
about
all
it
is
though
if
you
want
to
get
trashed
and
not
drink
hard
liqour
then
this
is
your
beer
if
there
is
any
other
reason
then
dont
drinkt
it
if
you
burn
your
mouth
on
hot
pizza
or
better
yet
are
a
flame
eater
this
beer
is
good
either
that
or
have
someone
urinate
in
your
mouth
you
probably
wont
tell
the
difference
dooby
dooby
doo
no
surprises
here
you
get
exactly
what
you
pay
for
unfortunately
this
was
the
best
beer
on
tap
at
the
two
closest
bars
to
my
new
residence
i
have
just
moved
to
hell
light
yellow
in
color
and
lacking
a
head
this
beer
smelled
a
little
grainy
and
cornsweet
no
real
hop
character
to
this
one
a
little
bit
of
sweet
taste
and
a
ton
of
carbonation
its
light
body
allows
one
to
drain
a
mug
very
quickly
after
that
mug
is
done
order
a
better
beer
if
you
can
im
sure
everyone
here
knows
what
ice
beer
is
brewed
at
cold
temperatures
ice
crystals
removed
higher
alcohol
yada
yada
so
i
will
get
right
to
my
review
the
6
pack
of
bottles
i
bought
were
a
couple
of
days
older
than
recommended
and
seeing
as
how
the
bottles
were
clear
i
feared
some
skunkage
not
so
it
poured
a
light
goldstraw
color
darker
than
bud
and
bud
light
and
actually
produced
a
decent
but
fizzy
head
that
lasted
about
a
minute
i
sniffed
it
and
there
was
no
skunkiness
it
was
a
very
clean
smell
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
probably
from
the
adjuncts
i
sipped
it
very
watery
feel
and
somewhat
sweet
taste
no
bitterness
but
some
slight
alcohol
warmth
in
my
stomach
after
the
first
few
sips
the
rest
went
down
like
beer
flavored
water
i
find
it
hard
to
hate
this
beer
because
it
is
so
lacking
in
taste
probably
a
good
beer
to
get
drunk
to
seeing
how
it
goes
down
easily
and
has
increased
alcohol
but
after
1
bottle
i
started
feeling
the
birth
of
a
headache
that
is
so
commonly
associated
with
bud
products
overall
not
entirely
bad
stuff
and
quite
refreshing
just
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
doobie
doobie
doo
its
an
ice
beer
hasnt
the
ice
beer
fad
gone
away
yet
pours
out
to
a
light
golden
color
with
a
fast
disappating
head
taste
is
very
light
with
heavy
carbination
very
little
hop
taste
i
can
see
these
being
chugged
easily
due
to
lack
of
tastebody
maybe
good
out
of
a
funnerbeer
bong
but
not
something
to
sit
and
enjoy
pale
yellow
clear
almost
light
off
color
water
extremely
carbonated
with
quickly
vanishing
head
smell
is
almost
non
existent
at
cold
temperatures
once
warming
the
beer
smells
slightly
of
hopps
and
grain
taste
is
similar
to
regular
budweiser
with
a
slightly
more
bitter
hoppiness
pared
with
a
more
pronounced
alcohol
flavor
not
much
better
if
at
all
than
the
rest
of
their
lineup
hey
its
ice
beer
its
a
little
better
than
nattie
ice
too
the
entire
point
of
ice
beer
is
too
kick
the
crap
out
of
you
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
bud
ice
does
its
job
wow
they
made
beer
with
no
taste
great
stuff
i
would
rather
drink
the
regular
bud
but
i
still
wouldnt
want
to
do
that
blaaaaahhh
coming
soon
bud
dry
ice
a
can
that
releases
clouds
of
fog
when
opened
pop
open
a
case
and
pretend
youre
at
a
kiss
concert
ice
beer
is
it
really
special
many
people
seem
to
think
so
what
is
ice
beer
it
is
malt
liquor
dropped
to
freezing
then
the
ice
is
removed
so
what
remains
is
a
much
stronger
malt
liquor
ice
beer
is
for
people
who
dont
really
like
beer
but
they
want
to
get
drunk
faster
i
suppose
here
is
another
fine
example
of
a
crappy
beer
from
the
king
of
crap
beer
anheuserbusch
inc
notes
somewhat
hard
to
coax
down
there
are
better
and
easier
drinking
american
ice
beers
out
there
some
breweries
should
stick
with
what
they
do
best
and
some
beer
drinkers
should
stick
to
what
they
can
drink
without
making
a
face
i
have
to
say
that
to
me
this
is
like
the
american
heineken
which
is
a
good
thing
you
can
taste
the
rice
in
it
but
this
will
probably
end
up
being
my
go
to
home
beer
since
its
so
incredibly
cheap
and
it
has
a
very
similar
flavor
profile
to
heineken
good
beer
this
is
my
go
to
brew
obviously
nothing
special
but
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
brews
that
the
big
three
put
out
overall
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
is
pretty
boring
perhaps
one
of
my
favorite
big
company
beers
almost
like
any
other
pale
yellow
beer
except
something
is
different
in
taste
compared
to
the
rest
not
bad
for
a
day
out
on
the
lake
not
to
over
priced
and
is
refreshing
probably
one
of
the
better
big
domestic
pilsner
beers
out
there
if
you
cant
get
a
good
canadian
beer
a
bud
is
your
next
best
bet
the
more
you
drink
the
better
they
get
lol
an
awful
beer
almost
tastes
off
way
better
than
craft
beer
good
beer
if
youre
low
on
cash
crisp
and
fresh
taste
pineappleapple
aromas
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
pretty
awful
smell
nothing
special
in
color
easy
to
drink
not
brewed
the
hard
way
two
thumbs
down
classic
lager
crisp
great
on
a
hot
day
if
youre
going
to
drink
budweiser
make
sure
its
in
a
cold
glass
bottle
its
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
its
a
dang
good
beer
and
very
underrated
drinking
it
out
of
a
can
is
a
different
story
there
is
always
a
weird
metallic
tatse
that
takes
over
and
makes
it
tatse
dirty
awful
smell
starts
within
few
minutes
but
otherwise
very
enjoyable
easytodrink
beer
that
i
can
just
drink
while
chilling
nothing
special
but
i
would
still
buy
it
this
beer
is
apparently
brewed
the
hard
way

5everyone
need
to
try
a
budweiser
even
if
it
is
only
once
this
is
not
as
bad
as
some
make
it
out
to
be
it
is
what
it
is
and
that
is
an
american
adjunct
lager
it
is
not
much
different
than
many
of
the
retro
brews
that
have
gain
popularity
i
have
done
a
few
blind
taste
test
against
some
of
the
other
more
favorable
adjunct
lagers
and
i
found
budweiser
actually
taste
better
the
beer
has
a
soft
water
feel
in
the
mouth
it
finishes
with
a
crisp
aftertaste
i
guess
if
i
had
a
choice
of
adjuncts

very
clear
yellow
color
does
have
a
nice
white
foamy
head
not
much
of
an
aroma
and
not
much
of
a
taste
a
notch
above
bud
light
but
still
only
tastes
like
water
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
burn
the
only
place
for
a
beer
like
this
is
when
its
the
only
thing
around
and
youre
doing
some
grilling
on
a
hot
day
just
plain
not
good
theres
really
not
much
to
say
about
budweiser
that
hasnt
already
been
said
it
pours
out
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
fleeting
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
very
light
there
is
some
perceptible
hoping
and
malt
but
it
is
very
faint
the
light
body
contributes
to
the
very
thin
mouthfeel
although
the
carbonation
level
is
good
for
what
it
is
bud
is
very
good
its
nothing
special
for
sure
but
hardly
as
bad
as
many
detractors
would
have
you
believe
o
again
we
all
know
what
this
is
but
i
will
never
turn
down
a
cold
bud
on
a
summer
day
ever
always
a
lil
room
in
my
fridge
for
this
classic
notes
bottle
poured
down
the
middle
of
a
glass
with
a
3
mouth
2
collar
of
foam
remained
for
most
of
the
glass
a
gentle
sweetness
on
the
tip
of
the
toungue
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
absolutely
no
aftertaste
the
beer
is
designed
to
allow
its
yeast
strain
to
stand
out
and
it
does
its
not
a
vehicle
for
giant
amounts
of
hops
its
just
a
damn
fine
beer
budweiser
the
great
american
lager
this
beer
is
goes
with
anything
and
everything
budweiser
has

this
brew
is

drink
anytime
this
brew
pours
out
a

smell
is

you
pick

an

budweiser
smells
like
what
beer
should
smell
like
the
taste
is
rich
with
flavor
you
pick
up
bold
taste
of
malts
and
grains
this
brew
is
smooth
with
a
clean
finish
this
is
nothing
bad
about
about
the
taste
of
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
5
0
out
5
a
great
american
beer
at
at
great
price
you
cant
get
anymore
american
than
budweiser
stay
true
to
the
red
white
and
blue
drink
budweiser
i
will
buy
this
brew
again
budweiser
is
often
criticized
for
having
a
bland
and
utterly
watered
down
taste
and
in
the
bottle
and
can
it
is
but
for
whatever
reason
budweiser
is
a
completely
different
beer
on
tap
now
granted
almost
every
beer
is
a
little
bit
better
on
draft
but
very
few
taste
as
noticeably
different
and
far
better
at
that
than
budweiser
does
on
tap
its
almost
staggering
because
the
draft
budweiser
is
very
smooth
but
not
bland
to
even
the
slightest
and
has
a
sweet
yet
malty
taste
with
an
after
taste
youd
expect
from
a
beer
aged
in
wooden
barrels
i
often
like
ordering
it
and
asking
bud
haters
beer
hipsters
to
try
it
playing
it
off
as
something
else
and
they
end
up
liking
it
a
lot
shocked
to
find
out
that
its
budweiser
my
guess
is
that
they
water
down
their
canned
and
bottled
counter
parts
to
save
money
because
its
awful
but
budweiser
is
a
damn
good
beer
on
tap
o
am
going
there
simply
put
piss
off
haters
pull
your
head
out
of
your
snobbish
tail
a
smooth
easy
drinking
good
lager
this
wont
set
the
world
on
fire
but
a
damn
fine
sessionable
lager
great
when
you
dont
have
to
think
about
it
beech
wood
aging
probably
removes
the
stronger
flavor
of
hops
and
leaves
the
woody
rice
flavor
quenches
a
thirst
but
only
good
for
the
easy
buzz
and
cheap
price
like
most
mass
produced
boring
offerings
of
us
megabreweries
king
of
beers
slogan
is
embarrassing
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
i
never
purchase
it
and
stay
away
from
it
unless
i
am
desperate
to
get
drunk
for
some
reason
and
have
no
other
options
some
may
love
its
taste
but
if
i
can
give
my
advice
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
for
the
same
price
overall
budweiser
is
a
respectable
lager
great
for
fishing
camping
bbq
etc
light
and
clean
tastes
good
easy
to
drink
budweiser
is
an
enjoyable
beer
besides
not
holding
a
head
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
taste
and
texture
are
excellent
smooth
and
flavorful
even
more
so
considering
the
style
sooner
or
later
a
beer
ticker
will
get
around
to
reviewing
this
classic
icon
of
american
macrobrewery
homogenous
mediocrity
and
my
opportunity
as
such
arrived
about
an
hour
before
midnight
this
new
years
eve
wondering
what
the
hell
to
have
from
a
really
limited
tap
selection
why
not
watch
the
flames
continue
to
stink
while
drinking
the
flagship
offering
of
the
huge
brewing
empire
that
basically
now
owns
the
dome
as
expected
this
one
is
ghostly
pale
although
maybe
a
tiny
bit
darker
than
some
of
its
competitors
a
light
golden
straw
color
speckled
with
white
foam
and
full
of
bubbly
geysers
from
top
to
bottom
looks
like
someone
dropped
an
alkaseltzer
tablet
into
diluted
apple
juice
smells
of
doughy
old
malt
corn
sugar
a
middling
green
apple
ting
and
wasted
youth
tastes
like
fizzy
water
perhaps
one
of
the
least
flavorful
beers
ive
tried
although
if
you
scrunch
up
your
brow
and
focus
you
will
get
a
little
sweet
white
bread
the
aforementioned
green
apple
fruitiness
a
stale
earthy
hop
bitterness
some
other
sweet
flavor
that
tastes
decidedly
artificial
to
be
fair
this
tastes
better
than
some
of
its
competitors
the
offflavors
are
muted
and
clearly
someone
wanted
this
to
taste
palatable
or
perhaps
taste
like
as
little
as
possible
i
get
a
little
plaster
or
starchy
glue
but
no
clear
metal
or
plastic
the
finish
is
remarkable
in
a
way
you
get
a
bit
of
that
artificial
sweetness
for
a
moment
followed
by
a
clean
bitterness
and
then
nothing
at
all
like
a
drop
of
water
instantly
evaporating
the
aftertaste
is
there
and
then
its
gone
poof
the
massive
carbonation
scrubs
the
palate
clean
apparently
the
distinctive
czech
pilsener
this
is
very
loosely
based
on
budvar
includes
a
hint
of
vanilla
flavor
from
the
malthops
combination
used
and
lo
and
behold
i
did
notice
this
here
although
perhaps
this
is
just
the
power
of
suggestion
there
it
is
moving
right
along
verdict
its
what
youd
expect
from
the
style
bland
and
boring
a
far
cry
from
anything
a
bavarian
would
call
beer
the
body
is
smooth
the
balance
of
flavor
is
nice
all
things
considered
but
the
flavors
themselves
arent
that
enjoyable
i
had
no
problem
finishing
a
12oz
can
but
its
not
something
id
like
to
revisit
anytime
soon
o
this
is
not
a
craft
beer
but
is
very
important
in
us
history
many
craft
beer
drinkers
anti
budweiser
miller
and
coors
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
made
i
guess
i
am
not
a
rebel
trying
to
be
differant
like
most
craft
beer
drinkers
are
if
you
grade
a
beer
you
must
respect
it
although
there
are
many
beers
with
more
taste
and
feel
there
are
not
any
with
more
history
and
tradition
as
budweiser
no
other
beer
rated
here
can
match
do
not
endorse
this
subpar
product
overall
this
beer
has
so
much
history
in
my
life
i
could
never
put
it
down
who
knows
what
the
long
term
effects
of
belgium
ownership
will
produce
appears
at
the
bottom
to
be
hands
off
for
now
perfect
clarity
with
a
soapy
foamy
white
head
that
dissipated
into
soapy
lacing
nose
is
sweet
somewhat
cloying
canned
vegetables
grain
husk
taste
follows
nose
with
a
sweet
sour
tangy
sharpness
with
some
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
grain
husk
slightly
grassy
and
vegetal
extremely
crisp
due
to
high
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
end
of
medium
american
budweiser
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
the
pretentious
beer
snobs
want
to
think
it
is
especially
fresh
on
draft
look
at
any
of
the
reviews
with
low
marks
how
many
people
actually
took
the
time
out
to
review
the
beer
and
state
why
it
sucks
it
doesnt
at
all
budweiser
isnt
a
microbrew
but
it
does
take
craft
to
brew
something
so
ubiquitous
yet
satisfying
this
beer
will
still
be
selling
when
the
ipa
fad
goes
the
way
of
the
dodo
drank
straight
out
of
the
bottle
taste
is
reminiscent
of
cherry
cough
syrup
quite
light
with
little
bitterness
no
layers
or
nuances
of
flavour
that
i
could
detect
no
scent
at
all
very
mild
carbonation
overall
an
unimpressive
beer
in
my
opinion
this
beer
came
last
score
wise
it
lacked
depth
flavour
and
character
it
was
like
a
cheap
supermarket
lager
with
lemonade
added
too
sweet
and
wishywashy
ive
no
idea
if
the
uk
brewed
version
is
identical
to
the
us
one
but
this
isnt
the
king
of
beers
in
my
eyes
at
all
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
pure
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
no
discernible
smell
light
taste
no
malt
discernible
some
disagreeable
hop
taste
present
almost
no
mouthfeel
feels
thinner
than
water
american
staple
i
like
it
good
party
beer
lawn
mowin
beer
etc
a
gift
from
god
the
greatest
thing
ever
put
in
a
bottle
overall
it
is
not
trying
to
be
a
ipa
or
stout
it
is
a
mass
produced
aa
lager
it
holds
its
own
against
any
american
adjuncts
lager
it
is
the
most
popular
beer
in
the
country
not
because
it
has
no
taste
as
some
contend
but
because
the
flavors
blend
together
seamlessly
good
word
describe
budweiser
seamlessly
what
if
your
dna
was
worth
500
billion
would
you
always
be
so
feminine
its
just
not
very
good
plain
and
simple
crystal
clear
pale
straw
color
with
a
decent
sized
bubbly
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
leaving
minimal
lace
aromas
of
light
coarse
grain
light
green
apple
and
a
moderate
spicy
floral
hop
the
flavor
is
a
light
sweet
honey
like
bready
maltiness
just
enough
spicy
hop
to
counter
the
sweetness
and
light
hop
bitterness
light
body
with
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
sharp
mouthfeel
quite
a
contrast
from
the
pbr
this
is
lighter
and
less
sweet
but
still
falls
well
into
the
style
guide
o
aal
they
are
what
we
thought
they
were
but
for
a
horrible
style
this
is
actually
one
of
the
best
of
the
bunch
not
something
id
choose
to
buy
only
have
this
cause
it
was
a
left
over
of
a
six
pack
i
bought
for
my
dad
but
if
you
have
to
have
an
aal
you
could
certainly
choose
worse
overall
much
better
than
i
expected
obviously
not
very
complex
but
ok
hail
to
the
redskins
overall
assuming
you
drink
this
cold
you
dont
want
this
to
warm
up
this
isnt
all
bad
its
a
beer
intended
for
those
who
just
want
to
get
drunk
quickly
and
dont
care
too
much
about
what
theyre
putting
in
their
body
this
is
good
for
that
purpose
as
its
bland
and
watery
but
it
just
doesnt
have
any
character
the
very
epitome
of
bland
budweiser
is
a
pale
lager
with
only
a
trace
grain
flavor
which
while
not
entirely
unpleasant
just
isnt
what
you
want
in
beer
it
doesnt
even
have
the
normal
refreshing
mouthfeel
of
a
lager
really
the
only
thing
keeping
it
from
having
1s
across
the
board
is
that
while
bland
its
not
completely
disgusting
only
approach
it
if
youre
after
a
cheap
buzz
or
if
theres
absolutely
nothing
else
to
drink
budweiser
is
a
classic
beer
if
youre
from
the
states
its
the
go
to
beer
on
hot
days
its
certainly
a
conditional
beer
not
what
i
would
puck
up
a
6
pack
of
to
relax
on
a
friday
night
but
certainly
refreshing
and
flavorful
i
have
to
disagree
with
it
being
king
of
beers
but
i
would
recommend
it
o
not
much
to
say
because
there
is
not
much
to
it
it
has
really
no
flavor
to
it
and
no
body
the
bros
gave
it
an
80
kick
backs
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
to
try
to
get
the
best
possible
results
smells
kind
of
like
an
old
barn
hey
smell
hey
and
carbonation
looks
exactly
like
a
glass
of
my
pee
there
is
a
small
head
that
quickly
instantaneously
evaporates
into
nothing
there
is
a
very
slight
cling
to
the
glass
all
thin
carbonation
it
doesnt
stick
though
it
just
leaves
the
glass
looking
spot
glean
like
i
just
rinsed
it
out
the
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
thin
and
instantly
washes
away
into
flat
carbonation
then
the
hey
taste
very
quickly
followed
by
lime
and
baking
soda
i
get
a
tongue
full
of
baking
soda
this
is
god
awful
beer
if
you
can
call
it
that
its
like
drinking
its
like
when
you
used
to
brush
your
teeth
with
baking
soda
as
a
kid
in
short
you
would
have
to
be
looking
for
a
very
cheap
buzz
to
drink
this
stuff
you
have
to
be
a
bit
of
an
alchi
to
get
any
enjoyment
at
all
basically
im
going
to
wait
until
my
friend
goes
and
takes
a
leak
and
then
have
the
bar
tender
drain
pour
it
then
im
going
to
order
some
onion
rings
i
have
no
idea
how
people
drink
this
stuff
had
to
take
a
taste
of
budweiser
now
that
i
know
what
i
know
and
taste
how
i
taste
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
showed
a
clear
yellowgolden
brew
with
a
2
finger
head
that
went
south
fast
nothing
much
came
through
in
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
clean
with
a
refreshing
finish
taste
was
simple
as
you
should
expect
from
a
adjunct
lager
the
fact
that
you
can
find
this
all
over
the
world
should
hint
at
the
respect
it
deserves
from
the
standpoint
of
the
brewmasters
who
started
this
brand
on
its
path
that
being
said
beers
such
as
grain
belt
have
more
flavor
sweet
corn
to
speak
of
but
arent
found
in
almost
every
store
in
the
united
states
people
can
afford
it
find
it
and
pound
it
thats
what
makes
it
the
king
of
beers
not
the
best
beer
by
any
means
neither
were
most
kings
if
you
think
about
it
but
a
beer
that
is
one
of
the
best
at
being
what
it
was
brewed
to
be
a
popular
beer
for
the
people
bud
heavy
also
know
as
the
diesel
isnt
terrible
too
bad
it
is
what
people
from
the
uk
get
for
american
beer
they
are
really
missing
out
for
cheap
beer
it
is
probably
the
best
out
of
all
of
them
it
has
a
grainy
flavor
with
no
bite
it
is
tingly
and
pleasant
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
feels
like
it
is
going
to
be
smooth
all
the
way
up
to
the
after
taste
it
goes
down
a
little
rough
o
as
expected
the
beer
is
not
very
good
there
arent
any
flavors
that
i
would
consider
noteworthy
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
too
damn
watery
it
gets
worse
towards
the
end
once
the
beer
begins
to
warm
up
normally
good
quality
beers
get
better
as
they
warm
up
since
you
get
more
flavors
but
with
this
one
all
you
get
is
more
diluted
flavors
and
a
stronger
alcohol
taste
it
does
have
some
flavor
but
its
weak
and
not
memorable
its
actually
kind
of
sad
since
i
know
that
anheuser
busch
has
the
capabilities
to
make
this
a
better
beer
but
they
never
will
american
macro
beers
dont
have
to
be
this
bland
it
is
what
it
is
and
unfortunately
this
is
what
americans
are
now
used
to
i
would
give
this
beer
a
below
average
rating
it
is
still
better
than
a
bud
light
or
a
coors
light
ill
damn
it
with
faint
praise
and
describe
it
as
cleantasting
so
clean
that
it
could
almost
be
mistaken
for
water
ultimately
while
bud
may
be
an
excellent
example
of
an
adjunct
lager
its
a
style
i
dont
much
care
for
hence
my
low
rating
i
believe
that
beer
should
have
more
character
and
presence
than
this
no
matter
the
circumstances
a
classic
and
a
marketing
success
but
theres
no
need
to
seek
it
out
its
a
decent
beer
cheers
this
beer
sucks
its
not
american
it
tastes
bad
its
tasteless
the
flavor
is
minimal
and
the
color
appears
to
be
the
same
as
my
cat
smooches
urine
this
beer
was
never
good
but
once
the
belgians
went
and
purchased
this
beer
it
got
worse
which
is
outrageously
suprising
seeing
as
the
belgians
usually
bring
the
noise
when
it
comes
to
cerveza
i
mean
if
you
are
trying
to
guzzle
a
sweet
sweet
sweeet
brew
check
that
tecate
light
tecate
light
has
all
the
flavor
you
would
ever
need
and
its
from
mexico
who
doesnt
love
mexico
lord
knows
i
do
get
turned
on
to
that
flave
and
step
your
game
up
kids
one
love
o
better
than
some
other
common
lagers
but
that
isnt
saying
much
either
not
the
worst
to
drink
but
pretty
average
at
best
o
cheap
and
easy
to
find
not
the
worst
of
the
domestic
beers
mostly
because
of
the
5
alcohol
but
the
taste
is
terrible
the
king
of
beers
is
not
worthy
of
a
crown
worst
beer
ever
and
its
the
only
beer
that
i
would
never
want
to
try
again
it
seems
to
be
only
enjoyed
by
those
who
settle
for
what
has
no
taste
i
would
choose
any
beer
over
this
beer
i
love
beer
but
if
budweiser
was
the
only
beer
made
i
would
give
up
beer
even
with
the
faults
its
like
the
beer
version
of
most
pinot
grigio
fairly
neutral
and
inoffensive
you
can
session
it
without
guilt
or
fault
but
there
will
be
no
epiphany
while
drinking
overall
i
think
most
people
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
is
something
widely
available
and
a
beer
everyone
has
had
this
ladies
and
germs
is
the
king
of
beers
all
this
time
you
thought
pliny
ht
or
westie
would
grace
the
throne
but
you
are
incorrect
while
i
dont
find
it
very
palatable
this
beer
does
for
most
americans
what
they
want
it
to
do
gets
them
a
buzz
without
giving
them
a
hassle
lets
them
forget
their
woes
by
imbibing
large
quantities
quickly
i
will
keep
my
dipas
and
my
riss
but
america
will
always
love
the
adjunct
lager
overall
i
think
this
classic
brew
succeeds
in
being
a
mostly
flavorless
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
crusher
i
also
have
noticed
many
people
commenting
on
the
corn
in
this
beer
there
is
no
corn
used
in
budweiser
there
is
however
rice
o
this
beer
goes
down
easily
the
smell
or
taste
isnt
offensive
but
are
ones
that
i
would
not
particularly
seek
out
the
above
numbers
represent
a
review
that
is
as
honest
and
straightforward
as
the
beer
it
evaluates
for
the
beer
advocates
who
get
it
this
buds
for
you
on
another
sidenote
i
wonder
if
freshness
is
an
issue
with
this
beer
this
is
much
better
than
i
remembered
it
being
maybe
this
one
was
fresher
than
usual
or
maybe
it
is
better
in
the
can
than
the
bottle
very
strange
indeed
remarks
about
what
i
remembered
i
cant
believe
i
cant
convince
my
brother
that
there
are
much
better
beers
than
this
worse
then
i
remembered
cooked
sweet
rice
no
hops
an
aftertaste
of
rubbing
alcohol
its
fusel
from
poor
brewing
never
again
maybe
i
got
the
wrong
batch
pabst
blue
ribbon
is
better
miller
highlife
is
better
national
bohemian
is
better
budweiser
is
the
overpriced
worst
american
beer
pick
the
other
ones
or
buy
a
real
beer
overall
the
classic
bud
taste
while
not
too
layered
isnt
all
that
bad
in
and
of
itself
but
the
smell
texture
and
consistancy
leave
something
to
be
desired
coming
from
st
louis
this
is
the
beer
ive
known
since
birth
the
king
of
beers
certainly
the
king
of
adjunct
lagers
this
and
probably
either
samuel
adams
pabst
blue
ribbon
or
lone
star
are
my
other
favorite
adjunct
beers
but
back
to
bud
i
love
this
beer
it
is
the
most
accessible
beer
at
a
fair
price
it
has
a
wonderful
taste
that
makes
up
for
its
faint
aroma
the
taste
is
mostly
consistent
of
corn
and
grain
its
got
a
nice
slick
mouth
feel
that
has
a
little
creaminess
to
it
but
not
a
lot
i
do
love
this
beer
its
drinkable
smooth
tasty
and
its
refreshing
a
lot
of
beer
geeks
snobs
slam
it
and
think
its
beneath
them
but
you
gotta
have
a
good
goto
beer
when
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
a
more
experimental
type
beer
maybe
im
a
tad
biased
since
im
from
st
louis
but
still
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
if
theyre
willing
to
actually
try
it
without
having
a
preconception
of
distaste
enjoy
friends
would
drink
again
like
many
fresh
brown
bottled
american
adjunct
lagers
the
king
of
beers
was
unoffensive
and
went
down
easily
overall
pretty
decent
for
the
style
only
1700
people
have
reviewd
this
beer
and
that
is
amazing
considering
i
bet
every
single
person
on
here
has
tried
it
at
least
one
time
nobody
picks
up
the
louisville
wooden
bat
and
jumps
into
the
bigs
they
start
with
a
tee
which
in
this
symbolic
move
is
a
mega
brewers
lager
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
it
is
extremely
clear
other
than
that
the
taste
head
retention
fizzyness
and
smell
are
all
below
par
as
for
the
beer
light
weight
mass
pro
american
lager
a
cold
one
on
a
hot
day
is
better
then
something
cold
that
isnt
beer
but
pretty
much
always
the
last
beer
i
am
going
to
choose
if
there
are
other
options
in
the
bucket
had
a
few
of
these
in
youth
and
id
have
to
say
this
is
a
standard
american
beer
going
back
now
23
or
so
years
i
believe
this
might
be
the
first
brew
i
had
at
around
2
or
3
years
old
i
remember
grabbin
the
bottle
and
goin
to
town
little
kid
like
and
all
at
some
party
my
parents
where
having
great
first
beer
but
will
not
be
my
last
thats
for
sure
is
that
a
beer
one
of
the
worst
and
most
disgusting
beer
i
have
ever
tried
unluckly
is
so
common
that
you
cannot
avoid
anyway
when
i
am
in
a
bar
with
just
this
beer
i
m
drinking
water
because
is
much
much
much
better
no
comment
no
no
no
and
no
again
o
its
cheap
and
drinkable
its
nice
on
hot
days
out
on
a
lake
or
around
a
swimming
pool
a
grainy
sort
of
murky
flavor
with
an
oddly
unpleasant
faint
bitter
edge
no
wonder
the
ladies
dont
like
it
ah
the
king
of
beers
yes
ab
has
roughly
47
of
the
market
47
people
sit
back
and
think
about
that
every
smallmedium
craftnanomicrohome
brewer
out
there
would
love
to
be
in
that
position
honestly
most
of
the
great
beers
ive
had
should
be
they
have
a
time
tested
formula
that
is
worth
billions
they
make
it
cheap
and
they
make
tons
of
it
ab
gets
a
lot
of
slack
rightfully
so
but
their
plain
ol
budweiser
isnt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
its
down
there
but
not
the
worst
if
i
had
to
say
anything
good
about
it
id
say
the
color
and
look
is
appealing
better
than
some
but
to
me
thats
where
it
ends
it
doesnt
smell
or
taste
good
however
the
taste
is
minimally
tolerable
i
would
not
recommend
but
i
would
love
to
shake
hands
with
the
person
who
drinks
beer
but
has
never
had
a
budweiser
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
finger
width
half
foamy
half
carbonated
head
poor
head
retention
very
mild
lacing
very
breadygrainy
aroma
with
ripened
bananas
mainly
bready
taste
with
slight
banana
at
the
end
moderately
carbonated
only
mild
hoppiness
but
not
very
bitter
at
all
somewhat
refreshing
but
definitely
not
a
go
to
beer
better
than
i
remembered
it
from
college
pours
a
clear
light
straw
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
fast
you
got
your
typical
lager
aroma
lots
if
nothing
this
beer
just
doesnt
hold
up
over
time
once
you
move
on
to
the
craft
market
i
see
no
reason
to
ever
drink
this
maybe
at
a
ball
game
where
the
only
other
option
is
bud
light
to
me
it
tastes
watered
down
i
know
it
not
the
flavors
just
dont
do
anything
for
me
only
reason
i
am
reviewing
is
because
it
was
left
in
my
fridge
o
just
a
typical
american
adjunct
lager
that
is
meant
for
people
to
slam
on
a
hot
day
after
maybe
some
lawn
work
or
whatever
but
if
youre
expecting
complexity
and
enjoyment
turn
somewhere
else
o
another
american
adjunct
lager
perfect
as
a
session
beer
in
hot
days
but
if
you
look
for
something
special
and
complex
avoid
budweiser
o
pretty
drinkable
im
not
sure
why
but
i
really
like
the
budweiser
yeast
the
taste
followed
the
nose
with
a
strong
metal
or
tin
malt
flavor
i
tend
to
enjoy
a
light
crisp
corn
adjunct
flavor
once
in
a
while
but
this
actually
possessed
none
of
that
the
tinnieness
follows
on
the
tongue
as
the
feel
never
lives
up
to
clean
crispness
that
should
be
there
the
color
was
a
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
frothy
head
there
is
a
consistent
taste
due
to
the
use
of
consistent
water
type
but
the
taste
isnt
that
great
tasted
like
corn
yet
the
beer
is
made
with
mostly
rice
and
was
quite
bland
the
beer
taste
bitter
if
poured
wrong
the
appearance
was
a
pale
light
yellowclear
beer
the
aroma
was
a
little
bit
sweet
but
just
smelled
like
normal
beer
and
nothing
too
special
i
was
surprised
with
the
taste
because
it
was
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
have
been
it
kind
of
had
a
grainycorn
taste
to
it
overall
i
thought
the
beer
was
mediocre
and
i
would
buy
bud
light
over
it
o
this
beer
is
not
anything
special
and
yes
its
corporate
interests
really
do
hurt
the
craft
beer
and
smaller
producers
but
the
beer
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
other
products
of
ab
that
being
said
i
would
likely
never
go
out
and
purchase
it
on
my
own
but
it
really
isnt
that
bad
overall
impressionmeh
overall
i
rate
according
to
style
and
compared
to
all
other
american
adjunct
lagers
budweiser
is
in
fact
above
average
but
dont
worry
i
deducted
25
points
on
my
overall
score
just
because
i
dont
like
budweiser
but
at
least
i
judged
this
beer
according
to
style
unlike
all
the
other
beer
snobs
who
dont
even
know
what
that
means
overall
this
is
often
seen
after
work
and
on
blistering
weekends
provided
by
my
friends
looking
to
swallow
a
few
back
over
conversation
barbecue
or
fishing
i
had
mine
today
with
an
old
pals
chatter
and
a
reuben
sandwich
this
is
a
daily
style
that
deserves
to
be
respected
for
what
it
is
and
for
the
intent
of
the
brewery
its
wellmade
by
people
who
care
about
what
they
are
doing
and
meets
its
mission
as
one
of
the
great
massmarket
drinkers
it
smells
okay
goes
down
smooth
leaves
little
aftertaste
and
lets
you
get
on
with
the
rest
of
your
day
not
the
worst
macro
but
id
never
buy
this
for
myself
overall
budweiser
is
decent
i
do
not
love
it
i
do
not
hate
it
but
i
do
drink
it
it
is
more
or
less
intended
for
mass
consumption
which
many
craft
brews
are
not
i
will
say
that
the
average
person
drinking
a
budweiser
is
most
likely
not
having
one
for
the
complex
taste
but
really
slamming
them
down
for
the
main
purpose
of
alcohol
overall
it
delivers
and
suits
its
purpose
overall
this
brew
gets
terrible
ratings
which
is
too
bad
because
it
is
a
classic
so
ill
give
it
mediocre
ratings
it
has
its
same
flat
tastes
from
a
bottle
ontap
and
from
a
can
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
cheap
crisp
beer
that
tastes
like
soda
water
and
rice
ill
buy
it
this
beer
has
an
undue
bad
name
all
their
other
products
are
garbage
from
shock
top
to
black
crown
to
bud
light
and
on
and
on
but
this
particular
brew
the
original
ive
always
preferred
to
its
competitors
and
it
does
have
a
useful
part
to
play
i
think
it
pours
a
yellow
straw
colored
watery
soda
fizz
mess
with
an
average
white
head
the
nose
is
a
lot
like
the
can
even
when
its
from
a
bottle
or
on
tap
an
odd
metallic
smell
but
there
is
some
grain
in
here
and
i
can
get
hops
if
i
focus
on
it
the
flavor
has
a
refreshing
mellowness
to
it
and
while
this
may
be
all
cut
up
with
corn
and
rice
and
whatever
else
it
does
retain
some
nice
malt
flavors
light
as
they
are
and
the
hopping
is
crisp
i
mean
im
never
going
to
go
out
and
buy
this
but
in
a
tiny
foreign
airport
a
concert
at
some
beer
wasteland
or
a
ballpark
with
no
better
options
i
actually
really
enjoy
a
budweiser
it
is
also
the
first
beer
i
ever
legally
bought
in
the
united
states
when
i
was
21
returning
from
overseas
so
it
has
some
sentimental
function
as
well
to
me
its
the
classic
american
working
mans
beer
nothing
special
but
far
from
repulsive
too
say
what
you
will
about
it
but
it
aint
half
as
bad
as
a
miller
or
coors
although
black
crown
is
unforgivable
sure
id
buy
a
lot
more
micro
brews
if
i
were
living
back
in
colorado
now
that
i
am
living
in
the
south
i
am
happy
to
have
a
budweiser
they
dont
have
much
of
anything
else
i
thought
that
budweiser
was
actually
a
decent
beer
when
i
tried
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
good
the
taste
of
hops
was
present
throughout
the
motuhfeel
of
this
was
actually
pretty
good
as
well
it
seemed
pretty
smooth
to
me
overall
this
historic
beer
is
worth
trying
and
isnt
a
bad
beer
to
have
once
in
awhile
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
overall
inoffensive
unfortunately
theres
not
much
here
in
terms
of
taste
or
flavor
and
it
only
gets
worse
as
it
warms
eerily
similar
to
a
cheap
carbonated
soda
overall
the
strength
of
this
beer
is
that
its
average
cheap
and
tasty
nothing
special
or
outstanding
but
thats
exactly
why
i
like
it
its
simply
a
tasty
beer
that
doesnt
overwhelm
your
mouth
or
your
stomach
not
an
excellent
beer
but
good
considering
it
is
a
mass
produced
brew
cheap
corn
grain
no
hop
presence
cheap
malts
not
a
good
beer
image
of
mass
production
poster
child
of
conforming
for
what
it
is
fake
beer
its
halfway
decent
people
who
drink
bud
i
beg
you
try
other
beers
the
corn
is
very
noticable
the
low
quality
is
in
your
face
if
a
friend
at
a
pub
bought
me
a
bud
i
would
drink
it
would
not
wanna
disrespect
him
but
its
garbage
budweiser
is
slightly
better
than
bud
light
but
really
what
is
that
saying
i
remember
after
years
of
drinking
bud
light
i
finally
had
a
budweiser
and
thought
it
had
so
much
flavor
heh
how
the
times
have
changed
tastes
like
this
beer
is
max
produced
as
quickly
and
cheaply
as
possible
in
order
to
reap
as
much
profit
as
possible
i
tried
my
best
ba
but
sometimes
a
beer
is
so
bad
that
its
incomprehensible
beyond
anything
but
piss
that
beer
is
budweiser
i
would
drink
the
contents
of
a
colostomy
bag
before
imbibing
this
swill
again
cheers
overall
this
is
a
pretty
crappy
beer
bad
flavor
and
too
sticky
a
mouthfeel
there
are
many
cheaper
aals
out
there
that
taste
much
better
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
but
nothing
special
i
hardly
ever
drink
bud
this
can
came
from
a
party
i
was
at
recently
and
got
me
thinking
that
i
never
reviewed
it
on
ba
so
i
brought
one
home
the
only
time
a
bud
is
good
is
when
you
are
feeling
a
little
cheap
or
short
on
cash
not
the
best
tasting
american
loggers
out
there
but
it
serves
its
purpose
if
you
only
want
to
get
drunk
and
dont
care
about
a
good
drinking
experience
some
times
the
first
one
could
taste
satisfying
after
a
long
day
of
work
then
it
begins
to
taste
syrupy
and
pissy
the
more
you
drink
and
if
you
do
have
too
many
lets
not
forget
about
the
budmud
the
next
day
injoy
i
dont
understand
when
i
see
people
walking
out
of
cvs
with
24
packs
of
this
stuff
at
least
go
with
miller
or
coors
if
youre
looking
for
cheapsit
game
day
beer
if
you
must
drink
a
beer
in
this
mileau
id
stick
to
pabst
good
drinkability
until
it
gets
warm
then
usual
adjunct
lager
offflavor
hits
you
with
no
mercy
overall
smooth
and
drinkable
is
not
an
unfair
description
but
theres
nothing
here
nothing
particularly
good
and
nothing
particularly
bad
there
are
far
worse
and
far
better
beers
extremely
consistent
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
adjunct
that
i
find
really
apealing
my
first
ever
beer
was
a
budweiser
its
solid
for
what
it
is
drank
out
of
a
bottle
this
is
the
3
2
percent
utah
version
im
drinking
not
the
5
0
like
most
get
budweiser
is
a
pretty
decent
american
adjunct
smelling
of
bread
corn
rice
and
some
barley
overall
70
out
of
100
pretty
decent
overall
the
king
of
beers
isnt
even
the
king
of
macros
budweiser
is
a
sorry
excuse
of
a
beer
i
used
to
say
this
before
i
had
ever
even
had
one
but
now
that
i
have
i
can
accurately
say
that
this
beer
sucks
overall
no
taste
no
head
rotten
colour
hopeless
packaging
just
about
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
o
it
is
what
it
is
an
aal
for
what
it
is
its
right
around
average
and
what
youd
expect
from
the
style
it
definitely
has
its
spot
in
the
beer
world
but
not
much
love
amongst
craft
lovers
kind
of
a
shame
overall
the
king
of
beers
is
nothing
more
than
a
bland
comparatively
flavorless
brew
even
amongst
other
adjuncts
nothing
too
offputting
in
the
flavor
but
theres
not
much
flavor
to
begin
with
give
me
a
red
stripe
tsingtao
or
pacifico
any
day
over
a
bud
oa
king
of
adjunct
rubbish
lagers
o
i
find
most
beers
are
better
ontap
but
not
bud
the
cans
are
way
better
then
this
crap
note
i
review
for
the
style
i
refuse
to
let
my
prejudices
slant
any
review
nothing
worse
than
the
typical
beer
snob
reviewing
an
aal
same
for
your
aal
drinker
reviewing
a
craft
brew
pound
for
pound
it
may
be
my
favorite
beer
tastes
like
america
the
classic
american
beer
atleast
anywhere
down
south
tastes
ok
the
price
is
right
for
what
you
are
getting
the
head
disappears
quickly
after
pouring
all
in
all
its
an
ok
brew
not
my
favorite
but
i
wont
pass
one
up
the
beer
has
a
decent
taste
not
what
i
would
call
great
the
beer
also
has
alot
of
carbination
so
it
kind
of
feels
like
you
are
drinking
an
alcoholic
soda
subtle
aroma
mouthfeel
and
taste
is
great
slightly
fruity
aroma
finishes
smoothly
with
little
aftertaste
very
good
session
beer
clear
golden
color
1
inch
collar
of
foam
in
the
glass
slight
bitterness
is
very
appealing
i
am
not
crazy
about
a
beer
that
has
an
aftertaste
that
stays
with
me
for
a
long
time
so
this
beer
works
very
well
for
me
fairly
standard
for
the
style
though
one
of
the
more
blanddrinkable
examples
compared
to
the
mostly
unpleasant
examples
usually
found
o
if
youre
some
where
and
you
dont
know
what
to
get
budweiser
is
you
standard
any
where
in
the
world
you
know
what
it
means
you
may
not
like
it
entirely
but
you
can
associate
with
it
and
it
doesnt
kill
you
usually
thats
why
you
will
buy
it
or
at
least
thats
why
i
will
buy
it
its
not
for
connoisseurs
but
those
those
who
want
reliability
over
having
mediocre
over
the
unknown
king
of
poop
thats
all
i
have
to
say
budweiser
is
in
my
opinion
the
worst
american
beer
out
there
way
too
much
sugar
and
carbonation
and
i
know
why
that
is
an
old
technique
to
cover
up
lousy
brew
also
sugar
is
one
of
the
most
addictive
substances
on
earth
so
why
do
you
think
it
is
so
popular
with
alchoholics
o
budweiser
it
is
what
it
is
and
that
aint
bad
ill
never
refuse
one
o
i
half
expected
this
to
taste
like
infected
monkey
anus
with
a
side
of
pus
in
other
words
like
bl
platinum
but
it
manages
to
be
merely
bad
if
its
offered
to
me
freely
at
a
party
without
anything
else
there
worthwhile
ill
drink
it
with
zero
complaints
still
itll
never
be
my
cheap
beer
fix
especially
when
yuenglings
lager
is
slightly
less
expensive
and
far
superior
in
quality
o
this
is
my
goto
bmc
but
im
not
going
to
sugar
coat
the
review
like
some
people
do
its
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
but
thats
only
because
the
price
is
super
low
i
dont
like
that
beer
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
the
appearance
is
a
clear
straw
color
the
smell
well
there
is
not
really
a
smell
it
only
smells
rice
the
taste
is
ok
but
it
isnt
the
best
too
it
tastes
rice
and
thats
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
overall
a
ok
beer
but
with
nothing
very
good
o
o
its
budweiser
if
i
had
to
stick
with
one
aal
the
rest
of
my
life
it
would
probably
be
this
and
they
date
their
bottles
a
lot
of
craft
breweries
need
to
learn
a
lesson
from
bud
theres
a
reason
they
call
it
the
king
of
beers
theres
also
a
reason
its
the
number
one
selling
import
noneuropean
beer
in
europe
and
the
fastest
growing
beer
in
the
world
by
volume
despite
what
beer
snobs
may
think
the
vast
majority
of
beer
drinkers
like
a
light
americanstyle
lager
beer
bud
is
the
quintessential
model
of
that
style
their
quality
control
is
absolutely
second
to
none
ive
met
with
the
management
a
number
of
times
and
their
penchant
for
quality
is
amazing
so
bud
it
delivers
exactly
what
it
promises
a
light
refreshing
beer
that
is
right
down
the
middle
of
the
road
not
hoppy
and
not
malty
if
you
want
a
smooth
easygoing
beer
bud
is
well
the
king
of
beers
overall
like
i
said
i
enjoy
it
call
me
crazy
but
for
what
it
is
its
a
pleasant
drinking
beer
much
better
than
some
of
the
garbage
out
there
in
the
more
budget
priced
sections
for
an
affordable
everyday
beer
its
the
one
i
go
for
solid
beer
nothing
fancy
overall
while
this
is
marketed
as
the
king
of
beer
it
is
more
like
the
anemic
prince
of
beers
it
is
easy
drinking
because
you
got
to
drink
two
cans
before
you
feel
like
you
had
one
overall
now
that
ive
been
a
ba
for
awhile
i
would
never
purchase
this
a
best
case
for
this
beer
would
be
to
mow
a
few
down
after
mowing
your
friends
lawn
and
this
is
all
he
had
in
his
fridge
a
typical
macro
i
spose
super
cheap
and
super
available
but
cant
recommend
overall
for
being
the
king
of
beers
its
not
very
good
it
has
its
places
like
when
there
is
nothing
else
to
drink
or
like
in
my
case
it
was
the
best
out
of
all
the
selection
at
an
open
bar
at
a
wedding
for
what
it
is
its
not
that
bad
honestly
ive
had
much
worse
craft
beers
and
how
can
you
argue
with
that
american
flag
can
o
high
abv
makes
it
nice
for
the
price
if
all
you
want
is
to
get
drunk
premium
budweiser
under
the
michelob
label
is
a
far
superior
product
if
youre
looking
for
something
similar
with
no
terrible
aftertaste
overall
bud
gets
a
bad
rep
on
these
boards
and
it
doesnt
really
bring
anything
to
the
table
but
it
didnt
taste
bad
i
will
probably
use
the
rest
of
the
6pack
for
cooking
ah
budweiser
everyone
has
heard
the
name
and
this
seemed
like
a
start
to
my
first
review
i
didnt
pour
it
into
a
glass
ive
done
so
many
time
before
and
it
is
a
straw
coloured
lager
with
a
good
dose
of
foam
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
with
a
lace
around
the
edges
faint
smell
of
adjunct
and
almost
no
flavor
but
that
metallic
adjunct
flavour
far
too
much
carbonation
appearance
is
what
it
should
be
its
a
go
to
beer
and
easily
accessible
theres
far
far
better
lagers
out
there
for
the
same
price
but
its
a
step
up
from
overpriced
corona
o
a
3
this
is
truly
an
average
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
purchased
cheaply
and
consumed
in
large
quantities
poured
from
a
can
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
standard
bright
yellow
with
a
one
finger
head
with
absolutely
no
lacing
the
fact
that
an
adjunct
retained
a
head
at
all
gives
it
a
slightly
above
average
score
on
the
appearance
the
smell
of
of
strong
adjunct
and
corn
with
some
wet
bread
actually
smelled
a
little
bit
better
than
the
standard
for
the
style
which
is
usually
adjunct
and
water
it
tasted
of
cooked
corn
with
a
slight
hint
of
some
sweetness
and
absolutely
no
water
worked
wonderfully
considering
the
fact
that
the
temperature
today
is
105
degrees
the
mouthfeel
is
this
beers
biggest
attribute
the
smoothest
adjunct
that
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
even
stronger
cooked
corn
flavor
comes
through
and
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
but
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
this
is
definitely
a
go
to
for
when
you
want
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
on
a
hot
day
o
this
isnt
a
bad
adjunct
lager
but
the
acetaldehyde
is
a
surprise
here
if
my
home
brewing
knowledge
serves
me
correctly
acetaldehyde
is
a
mark
of
a
beer
that
is
too
young
one
that
didnt
let
the
yeast
finish
its
job
when
i
think
about
it
this
doesnt
really
surprise
me
since
they
mass
produce
this
stuff
and
want
to
get
it
out
asap
aside
from
this
its
really
not
terrible
at
least
its
refreshing
den
i
get
why
this
is
considered
drinkable
i
can
drink
water
all
day
it
wouldnt
be
torture
to
drink
this
but
i
will
never
look
forward
to
getting
another
bottle
ill
drink
it
if
its
cheap
free
or
the
only
thing
available
if
theres
pabst
im
going
with
the
blue
ribbon
100
of
the
time
or
the
high
life
if
thats
whats
around
but
ill
gladly
throw
back
these
free
buds
with
nary
a
qualm
today
and
accept
the
resulting
buzz
this
beer
seems
to
have
changed
to
me
with
more
experience
in
better
beer
simply
has
no
taste
now
looks
even
worse
and
i
am
100
sure
after
the
merger
with
inbev
they
tampered
with
the
recipe
to
make
it
even
worse
the
beechwood
taste
that
used
to
be
there
is
now
completely
gone
and
now
has
a
taste
of
chemicals
o
for
some
reason
this
stuff
sometimes
gives
me
horrible
hangovers
and
terrible
headaches
really
not
the
case
with
any
other
macro
lager
ive
had
its
drinkable
but
i
usually
opt
for
others
of
the
style
before
this
one
folks
if
youre
on
a
budget
i
can
name
several
macros
that
are
more
suitable
the
above
mentioned
pbr
and
miller

even
coors
light
is
preferable

my

keep
your

good

serve
freeloaders
when
they
come

o
scored

this
one
nails
the
average

as
it
is
imo
the
quintessential
aal
score
here
is
based
on
a
quick

there

not

overall
the

up

i
havent
had
one
in
15
years
so
i
thought
it
was
time
to
sample
one
never
apreciated
this
beer
before
but
now
i
have
a
new
found
respect
and
the
classic

is
likewise
sweet
even
almost
syrupy
i
get
practically
all

as
id

for
such

a
bland
malt
taste
very
thin
with
soft
fullness
from

a
not

pleasing

on
your
palate
as
the

warmed
up
the

got
worse
o
macrogarbage
but
not
the
most

on

market
drinkable
ice
cold
on
a
stinking

how
can
you
be
american
and
insult
this
golden
delight
your
snobby
beer
taste
has
lead
you
in
the
direction
of
spoiled
connoisseur
do
yourselves
a
favor
and
try
to
open
up
and
make
famous
your
own
establishment
instead
of
ripping
on
others
miracle
creation
it
pours
a
clear
strawlike
color
with
a
instantly
dissipating
foam
no
discernible
aroma
the
flavor
is
middling
with
a
honeyed
cornliquor
sweetness
that
quickly
falls
flat
and
turns
harsh
this
is
a
quintessential
cornadjunct
lager
with
no
reason
other
than
a
powerful
marketing
budget
to
drink
final
reflection
this
beer
gave
me
a
headache
avoid
avoid
avoid
budweiser
is
still
a
top
selling
beer
despite
precipitous
sales
declines
in
the
last
decade
recently
saw
6
pack
tallboys
on
sale
for
5
so
what
the
hell
its
been
awhile
appearance
is
golden
with
foamy
head
that
quickly
fades
away
the
beer
stays
highly
carbonated
smell
has
a
adjunct
scent
to
it
but
mostly
neutral
taste
is
a
bit
bland
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
sour
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
overall
much
less
bitter
than
i
remember
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
never
turn
it
down
when
offered
but
rarely
buy
it
overall
not
bad
as
a
40
really
but
the
price
and
the
last
14
lose
it
3
12
for
this
40
compared
to
2
75
and
2
50
for
malt
liquor
40s
that
are
decidedly
better
in
the
spirit
of
a
40
ill
get
this
if
im
craving
a
40
and
bud
light
is
the
only
other
40
in
the
store
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
care
this
pours
a
pale
yellow
and
the
light
side
of
the
spectrum
tons
of
cascading
bubbles
and
a
thing
clinging
of
white
head
the
aroma
has
faint
malt
character
with
a
musty
corn
sweetness
i
have
never
taken
the
time
to
concentrate
on
the
aroma
of
this
on
the
past
but
damn
this
is
pretty
bad
the
taste
isnt
much
better
the
little
amount
of
taste
that
comes
through
the
prickly
carbonation
is
corn
bread
and
a
bit
of
a
twang
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
mouthfeel
is
atrocious
light
as
a
feather
and
carbonated
to
the
max
overall
i
think
this
12
pack
is
going
to
be
difficult
to
get
rid
of
back
in
mexico
this
beer
was
a
great
break
from
all
those
corn
flavoured
mexican
beers
back
here
though
its
just
a
below
the
average
beer
i
can
see
why
it
is
so
popular
in
some
places
though
its
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
and
if
you
just
came
back
home
from
work
on
a
summer
evening
this
is
a
great
thirst
quencher
if
i
was
living
in
such
a
climate
myself
and
the
price
was
right
i
would
certainly
keep
a
bunch
of
those
in
my
fridge
how
can
budweiser
be
rated
poor
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worlds
most
popular
beers
get
over
it
beer
snobs
i
know
price
and
availability
dont
matter
to
yall
but
come
on
its
budweiser
its
a
good
beer
no
poor
rating
here
budweiser
is
a
solid
beer
with
taste
and
its
so
popular
for
a
reason
ov
bud
isnt
horrible
it
is
refreshing
readily
available
tasty
and
inexpensive
it
is
the
go
to
adjunct
lager
when
you
can
afford
a
few
pennies
more
than
busch
or
pbr
i
never
understood
why
so
many
flock
to
bud
light
its
worth
sacrificing
a
few
calories
to
enjoy
a
more
robust
flavor
and
receive
a
mild
kick
from
the
5
0
abv
at
least
this
tastes
like
a
beer
certainly
nothing
spectacular
but
it
also
doesnt
deserve
all
the
hate
if
im
at
a
sporting
event
or
at
a
party
i
wont
shy
away
from
bud
there
is
always
a
better
beer
but
not
necessarily
at
this
price
cheers
living
in
st
louis
for
the
past
three
years
has
perhaps
colored
my
opinion
but
anybody
who
drinks
miller
or
coors
or
even
heineken
over
this
is
a
fool
not
bad
as
a
refreshment
but
fails
as
a
beer
something
i
would
only
drink
if
theres
no
other
choice
king
of
beers
who
gave
them
that
label
i
guess
when
you
have
so
much
money
you
can
give
yourself
whatever
label
you
want
anyways
you
know
what
this
smells
and
tastes
like
so
no
point
describing
it
its
drinkable
but
not
enjoyable
i
enjoy
the
commercials
though
funny
my
first
review
is
on
bud
but
im
sick
of
beer
snobs
so
i
had
to
for
what
it
is
bud
is
truly
the
king
of
beers
it
is
the
best
american
mass
produced
lager
can
it
hold
a
candle
to
your
local
brews
and
ipas
or
a
sam
adams
utopia
no
but
its
not
trying
to
it
is
a
good
refreshing
after
work
beer
im
a
chef
and
after
12
hrs
on
the
line
i
want
a
refreshing
easy
drinker
not
a
punch
you
in
the
face
complex
drink
i
have
a
friend
who
is
a
beer
sommelier
and
he
drinks
bud
on
the
regular
if
its
good
enough
for
a
professional
its
good
enough
for
me
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
everything
and
at
a
bbq
tailgate
or
a
few
after
work
bud
never
fails
im
not
a
critic
or
connoisseur
and
i
dont
bash
anheuserbusch
no
this
isnt
the
best
macro
beer
in
my
opinion
but
i
cant
see
why
it
has
such
low
ratings
massmarketed
for
the
people
who
dont
have
time
to
think
about
what
they
are
drinking
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
very
translucent
straw
color
with
a
2
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
there
is
not
much
smell
here
slight
malt
but
probably
because
of
the
adjuncts
used
rice
predominately
it
doesnt
have
much
of
one
tastes
like
most
adjuncts
having
very
little
however
there
is
a
little
bit
of
hops
so
this
brings
it
up
a
little
carbonation
seems
right
and
beer
goes
down
smoothly
without
any
aftertastes
overall
very
average
adjunct
lager
however
not
the
worst
overall
it
is
a
classic
average
and
refreshing
it
is
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
out
there
and
is
very
standard
but
as
with
any
beer
it
has
its
place
this
one
is
built
for
tailgating
the
like
edit
original
ratings
are
a
little
too
harsh
i
should
leave
room
for
the
worse
beers
out
there
run
away
from
this
my
homies
run
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
typical
straw
yellowgolden
with
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
the
head
build
quickly
and
died
with
a
lot
of
noise
the
aroma
is
husky
grain
sweetness
with
a
metallic
twinge
the
taste
is
very
sweet
almost
candy
like
with
a
nice
aftertaste
that
is
mildly
bitter
this
is
actually
a
pretty
tasty
adjunct
lager
in
my
opinion
it
is
typical
yes
but
it
is
also
not
offensive
and
rather
enjoyable
the
mf
is
the
standard
for
adjunct
lagers
i
feel
that
this
beer
isnt
bad
at
all
for
a
standard
adjunct
lager
it
is
a
little
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
though
there
is
a
bit
more
of
a
taste
than
with
light
beers
but
the
cost
is
that
you
feel
full
and
unsatisfied
quickly
other
than
being
very
easy
to
drink
i
cant
think
of
any
other
positive
dont
care
for
budweiser
at
all
looks
darker
than
its
little
brother
and
tastes
super
grainy
with
little
to
no
mouthfeel
except
some
carbonation
not
complex
or
tastey
which
leaves
me
wondering
why
this
is
their
main
beer
i
dont
get
it
and
i
dont
want
it
leaves
you
wanting
something
else
to
wash
the
taste
out
of
your
mouth
let
this
be
o
ok
for
the
style
as
for
me
kinda
a
grill
side
beer
summertime
if
theres
not
much
else
around
bottled
budweiser
in
lebanon
drinking
from
the
bottle
because
bar
wouldnt
provide
beer
glassware
odd
thus
could
not
judge
the
appearance
properly
in
terms
of
colour
too
fizzy
in
the
mouth
and
left
a
strange
bitter
after
taste
may
have
been
a
bad
batch
not
sure
just
another
adult
soft
drink
250
characters
ok
i
was
at
the
celtics
game
last
night
and
a
friend
bought
me
a
bud
ill
take
a
free
beer
sure
in
the
cup
it
had
a
pale
yellow
color
i
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
bit
of
lacing
and
also
the
head
that
lasted
the
whole
time
taste
and
smell
we
all
know
its
not
a
highlight
here
mouthfeel
was
on
the
smooth
side
and
it
went
down
fairly
easily
while
its
cold
not
as
watery
as
i
remember
not
a
great
beer
but
its
a
staple
at
all
sporting
venues
and
i
guess
its
better
than
bud
light
overall
this
american
classic
sits
heavy
in
the
stomach
and
is
for
the
most
part
undesirable
this
beer
is
bright
and
clear
it
has
a
quarter
inch
of
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
film
it
leaves
a
little
bit
of
spotty
lacing
but
really
not
much
aroma
is
light
and
inoffensive
mildly
grainy
not
much
hop
presence
it
is
not
bad
just
not
especially
good
flavor
is
similar
mildly
sweet
light
and
unassuming
mouthfeel
is
light
good
carbonation
dry
refreshing
exactly
what
this
beer
should
be
i
do
understand
why
people
give
this
lower
grades
and
i
expected
to
give
it
lower
marks
but
it
is
an
adjunct
lager
and
it
is
so
inoffensive
and
unassuming
without
any
significant
off
flavors
that
i
cant
just
drink
it
cold
and
youre
all
good
o
this
beer
is
made
for
chugging
by
those
who
want
cheap
most
common
denominator
party
beer
unless
you
are
broke
and
need
a
beer
any
beer
dont
bother
o
easy
to
drink
better
than
bud
light
but
thats
not
saying
much
this
is
pure
chugging
party
beer
no
other
reason
to
ever
drink
this
this
isnt
all
that
bad
considering
the
style
its
a
goto
beer
when
on
a
budget
with
pizza
or
chinese
food
or
if
youre
watching
nascar
and
feel
amurrican
o
perfect
for
style
guidelines
but
an
aweful
beer
none
the
less
and
i
hate
the
smell
overall
advertised
as
the
king
of
beers
i
can
get
a
bud
anywhere
in
the
world
on
any
day
and
it
will
always
taste
the
same
the
quality
control
for
macro
brews
is
outstanding
on
maintaining
the
same
thing
all
the
time
but
it
is
not
a
king
or
a
prince
for
that
matter
it
is
something
to
drink
when
there
is
no
other
choice
what
can
you
say
about
the
great
american
lager
that
hasnt
already
been
said
well
bud
heavy
will
get
you
drunk
pours
yellow
with
high
carbonation
head
is
thin
the
smell
is
skunky
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
taste
is
crisp
but
very
shallow
bitter
and
sour
but
not
in
a
good
way
overall
this
is
low
brow
id
rather
have
a
pbr
on
tap
o
i
may
have
rated
it
too
high
overall
certainly
not
the
worst
aal
out
there
but
a
little
bit
under
average
good
to
get
drunk
off
of
though
o
overall
this
is
the
king
of
beers
and
budweiser
has
been
around
for
so
long
it
is
impossible
to
not
like
its
iconic
image
in
some
way
ill
drink
it
especially
when
i
can
find
it
for
dollar
drafts
at
almost
any
bar
in
my
area
overall
if
i
am
going
to
buy
massmarket
beers
this
will
be
it
not
real
exciting
for
someone
who
sticks
solely
to
craft
beers
but
its
good
enough
it
does
disturb
my
gastrointestinal
tract
if
drank
in
copious
amounts
but
its
not
bad
rather
drink
this
than
any
of
the
macro
light
beers
o
i
would
have
given
this
beer
a
better
review
if
this
drink
had
not
given
me
a
headache
i
have
drank
all
sorts
of
cheap
beers
and
malt
liquors
and
not
one
of
them
gave
me
a
headache
this
is
one
of
those
few
beers
in
which
i
turn
down
if
asked
for
one
o
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
beer
growing
up
around
chicago
not
something
that
you
savor
but
not
horrible
on
par
or
better
than
most
beers
in
its
class
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
aroma
is
nothing
much
other
than
light
earthy
scents
and
grass
taste
is
light
malt
and
corn
with
a
decent
smooth
mouthfeel
but
wheres
the
hop
aroma
and
bitterness
wheres
the
uniqueness
of
character
well
we
all
know
it
really
isnt
there
and
isnt
meant
to
be
there
still
its
my
goto
beer
when
there
is
no
craft
or
micros
around
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
pick
up
any
distinct
taste
and
thats
because
i
was
secretly
given
bud
i
will
say
if
there
is
only
domestics
on
tap
at
a
bar
ill
go
for
this
one
as
opposed
to
the
light
beers
as
it
packs
the
most
punch
for
your
dollar
hey
its
american
if
nothing
else
heed
the
words
of
craft
beersmiths
throughout
the
nation
if
you
dont
like
budwiser
you
at
least
have
to
respect
their
consistancy
i
give
it
a
fair
rating
and
thus
i
was
forced
to
review
ooverall
this
isnt
a
very
exciting
beer
the
king
of
beers
seems
to
be
kind
of
an
overstatement
still
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
bud
light
this
beer
is
not
one
to
brag
about
by
any
means
it
is
way
over
carbonated
and
the
taste
is
something
that
i
personally
can
hardly
bare
at
times
i
always
finish
my
beer
but
with
this
beer
i
find
it
a
challenge
to
do
so
i
even
at
times
suffer
from
headaches
resulting
from
this
brew
however
it
is
a
cheap
beer
and
people
find
it
somewhat
american
to
drink
it
but
i
as
a
beer
drinker
prefer
a
beer
with
much
more
character
you
get
what
you
pay
for
but
i
will
not
pay
for
a
bud
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
light
mouth
feel
like
a
lightly
carbonated
sparkling
water
there
is
little
with
respect
to
a
hop
note
in
the
flavor
but
again
this
is
a
mass
produced
american
lager
on
a
positive
note
the
budweiser
you
buy
in
florida
will
taste
like
the
budweiser
you
buy
in
alaska
overall
this
is
actually
as
horrible
as
people
say
i
came
in
thinking
it
would
earn
a
33
5
from
me
being
forgiving
nope
its
swill
good
thing
i
didnt
have
to
buy
it
o
found
pretty
much
everywhere
and
although
not
offensive
tastewise
not
very
interesting
good
and
cheap
if
planning
on
drinking
alot
budweiser
gets
a
good
deal
of
hate
and
the
beer
snobs
give
it
a
1
like
they
have
something
to
prove
but
budweiser
fits
its
role
pretty
damn
well
its
an
inexpensive
beer
that
has
enough
flavor
yet
one
you
can
pound
i
like
alot
of
stouts
and
ales
but
sometimes
a
budweiser
is
more
appropriate
for
an
afternoon
of
fishin
in
the
sun
nice
crisp
feel
with
a
subdued
flavor
definitely
refreshing
nothing
better
than
an
ice
cold
bud
not
the
best
beer
on
the
planet
by
any
means
but
not
deserving
of
the
bad
rap
it
gets
after
all
its
the
king
of
beers
had
this
bad
boy
on
tap
multiple
times
out
da
kegerator
if
you
pour
it
good
you
can
get
absolutely
no
head
on
it
looks
like
apple
juice
when
you
do
smells
just
like
a
an
average
macro
brew
nothing
specific
jumps
out
has
a
weird
almost
corn
taste
that
i
dont
normally
detect
out
of
the
bottle
id
say
i
prefer
to
drink
this
out
of
the
bottle
than
the
keg
i
have
no
clue
why
it
just
tastes
better
to
me
overall
dont
buy
just
get
a
real
beer
taste
very
light
bodied
but
clean
and
smooth
slight
and
i
mean
a
slight
hop
taste
not
much
taste
or
flavor
typical
lager
which
is
good
for
days
when
you
know
you
will
drink
more
than
you
should
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
bad
theres
not
much
flavor
but
i
understand
thats
what
some
people
like
on
to
the
next
served
in
a
pint
glass
yellow
brown
gold
with
rising
carb
smell
is
almost
non
existent
faint
sweetness
and
hop
but
very
faint
surprisingly
crisp
feel
with
spicy
taste
grainy
finish
this
is
better
than
the
usual
bottle
not
a
bad
choice
for
an
on
a
budget
bar
visit
i
had
my
first
budweiser
at
a
local
tavern
understandably
my
review
seems
to
fall
out
of
the
norm
however
i
must
admit
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
brew
i
am
a
belgianwhite
lover
handsdown
but
the
crispness
was
hard
to
deny
frankly
it
was
quite
refreshing
the
head
left
something
to
be
desired
but
my
pallet
was
quenched
on
occasion
i
think
ill
be
back
overall
it
was
bit
higher
than
i
expected
but
i
knew
i
never
had
a
problem
with
budweiser
something
about
bud
in
a
can
seems
pretty
damn
manly
1
5
d
the
only
reason
this
gets
a
1
5
instead
of
a
1
0
is
because
the
mouthfeel
isnt
horrible
i
cant
believe
this
is
this
bad
though
o
cheaper
way
to
get
drunk
at
a
football
game
or
pool
party
but
not
something
to
drink
as
a
regular
overall
when
budget
is
tight
sad
to
say
this
is
a
drink
of
choice
nothing
special
but
i
do
still
enjoy
drinking
this
brew
from
time
to
time
fared
poorly
overall
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
bad
theres
not
much
flavor
but
i
understand
thats
what
some
people
like
on
to
the
next
like
it
or
not
budweiser
is
linked
to
americas
history
growing
up
just
southeast
of
st
louis
were
this
is
brewed
i
might
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
unremarkable
beverage
just
due
to
homesickness
but
this
stuff
really
isnt
as
bad
a
people
make
it
out
to
be
i
guess
it
depends
on
mindset
and
the
individual
himself
and
what
hes
looking
for
in
a
glass
of
beer
a
macro
i
would
buy
again
if
my
first
choices
were
unavailable
overall
well
this
is
a
good
reminder
as
to
why
i
never
buy
this
budweiser
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
big
3
no
thanks
a
beer
snob
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
it
just
flat
out
makes
my
mouth
feel
bad
i
feel
the
need
to
go
brush
my
teeth
immediately
jiminy
christmas
this
is
rankawful
ill
be
going
back
to
craft
beer
in
a
few
seconds
i
tried
my
very
best
not
to
bash
this
beer
but
for
its
popularity
its
just
unforgivable
o
okay
you
have
to
approach
this
beer
differently
than
most
it
gets
a
horrible
rap
for
being
a
bad
beer
but
adjuncts
are
pretty
bad
in
general
if
i
have
to
drink
adjunct
budweiser
is
the
easiest
this
is
way
too
sweet
too
carbonated
and
too
crisp
for
me
its
drinkable
but
i
struggle
through
each
sip
o
while
i
might
like
to
make
fun
of
this
beer
i
find
it
is
more
than
drinkable
and
definitely
not
as
bad
as
some
inbevmc
brands
though
i
have
to
say
since
inbev
acquired
ab
i
feel
that
budweiser
has
gone
downhill
a
little
bit
and
i
find
it
hard
to
tell
the
difference
between
bud
and
bud
light
it
is
the
king
of
beers
and
is
the
beer
all
others
are
judged
hated
and
liked
by
i
wouldnt
keep
this
in
my
fridge
but
would
look
forward
to
the
right
situation
to
enjoy
it
again
ah
budweiser
the
king
of
beers
thats
a
term
i
laugh
at
pours
like
your
typical
american
adjunct
lager
pale
straw
more
like
urine
the
smell
is
full
of
corn
the
taste
is
somewhat
dry
i
dont
know
if
this
is
the
rice
talking
to
us
or
not
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
over
carbonated
and
the
glass
shows
us
this
the
head
while
it
lasts
is
pure
white
the
head
dwindles
down
into
nothing
budweiser
is
just
a
beer
when
nothing
better
is
available
its
ahead
of
the
lite
american
beers
but
far
behind
anything
that
constitutes
a
solid
brew
its
everywhere
and
sponsors
enough
events
to
make
it
the
only
choice
sometimes
its
drank
because
its
around
really
this
one
doesnt
do
much
for
me
but
not
many
adjunct
lagers
do
had
this
at
a
party
and
grabbed
this
because
it
was
the
beer
with
the
most
alcohol
there
the
beer
poured
a
somewhat
decent
darker
yellow
color
the
smell
was
just
of
corn
and
wheat
the
taste
was
just
awful
i
have
never
had
two
sips
and
went
straight
for
the
drain
i
just
dont
know
how
i
use
to
drink
this
garbage
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
not
awful
but
not
good
i
hated
this
beer
so
much
i
just
dont
see
how
they
can
call
themselves
the
king
of
beers
to
me
its
one
of
the
worst
beers
on
the
markets
ooverall
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
its
price
nothing
exceptional
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
i
can
enjoy
drinking
it
but
dont
look
forward
to
getting
it
always
a
good
beer
for
the
long
haul
budweiser
better
than
expected
i
was
at
a
charity
event
and
my
choices
were
fat
tire
corona
coors
light
and
budweiser
well
i
was
breaking
my
one
beer
per
night
rule
due
to
the
festivity
of
the
occasion
my
first
of
the
evening
was
a
fat
tire
given
the
remaining
choices
what
is
one
to
do
i
have
not
had
the
king
of
beers
in
well
over
30
years
the
aroma
was
much
better
than
expected
the
color
clear
and
golden
and
the
head
was
thin
pure
white
but
did
last
and
lace
well
the
flavor
was
smooth
properly
sweet
with
faint
hop
and
other
flavors
and
a
thin
finish
overall
not
bad
this
is
not
the
place
to
get
into
the
state
of
us
beer
law
the
power
of
big
breweries
even
without
them
most
sporting
events
and
tv
programs
would
loose
a
lot
of
funding
and
all
of
the
other
reasons
i
should
dislike
budweiser
the
product
itself
the
antimicro
brew
held
up
well
in
my
tasting
the
enjoyment
of
beer
can
take
you
to
the
most
unexpected
places
overall
now
while
i
have
bashed
ab
in
the
past
i
have
to
say
bud
might
be
the
true
king
in
this
style
i
have
had
many
craft
lagers
that
are
barely
better
then
this
that
being
said
i
will
have
no
problems
ordering
a
bud
when
in
a
non
craft
bar
overall
budweiser
is
better
than
some
and
worse
than
most
im
having
it
out
of
a
pintsized
american
as
long
as
they
put
it
in
these
flag
cans
or
their
new
cans
im
a
sucker
for
marketing
and
will
probably
buy
it
and
yes
i
know
they
are
owned
by
a
belgium
company
but
the
americans
are
patriotic
and
great
marketing
you
could
say
this
is
a
boring
beer
o
theres
a
reason
i
stopped
drinking
this
after
my
first
try
i
thought
id
be
fair
and
give
it
a
second
go
but
it
really
doesnt
hold
much
appeal
for
me
even
now
its
not
the
worst
ive
had
that
belongs
to
tsingtao
but
its
certainly
nothing
id
drink
unless
i
was
in
college
and
living
off
of
peanuts
and
1
dollar
bills
in
my
opinion
the
king
of
beers
is
a
peasant
overall
not
disappointing
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
here
but
a
dollar
for
a
big
can
ill
take
it
id
bring
a
few
of
these
to
a
party
although
id
probably
choose
yuengling
over
this
i
hesitate
to
call
it
smooth
because
there
are
so
many
good
beers
out
there
that
are
more
complex
and
much
higher
abv
that
are
more
tasty
and
drinkable
this
is
proper
stadium
beer
or
building
fence
beer
recommendation
would
be
to
avoid
unless
other
alternatives
rate
lower
o
i
find
it
a
bit
offensive
that
this
beer
has
the
king
of
beers
motto
in
its
label
what
is
that
statement
based
on
this
beer
could
be
a
good
cheap
alternative
for
some
but
i
would
recommend
to
avoid
it
and
cough
a
few
more
bucks
for
something
better
and
with
more
taste
thin
watery
mouthfeel
tastes
carbonated
and
bland
with
an
almost
sweet
stale
taste
i
couldnt
get
over
that
strange
sweetness
reminded
me
of
the
aftertaste
of
applesauce
that
has
begun
to
ferment
i
would
go
for
just
about
any
other
massproduced
domestic
over
this
one
i
can
tolerate
a
poor
beer
but
i
couldnt
finish
this
one
thats
never
happened
to
me
before
yes
i
am
ashamed
i
am
simply
not
a
fan
this
is
truly
the
rodney
dangerfield
of
brewsit
gets
no
respect
in
fact
it
is
a
decent
thirst
quencher
that
is
ok
for
a
night
in
the
sports
bar
or
when
you
are
low
on
funds
it
pours
a
nice
clear
yellow
it
has
no
scent
to
speak
of
it
is
not
offensive
to
the
taste
being
very
neutral
and
has
no
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
sodalike
pleasant
budweiser
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
on
finger
head
that
vanishes
quickly
with
no
lacing
to
speak
of
i
doesnt
really
have
too
much
of
a
smell
at
most
a
touch
of
grain
in
the
nose
this
beer
is
just
offensive
tasting
to
me
i
have
to
say
this
is
the
most
unpleasant
of
the
macro
beers
the
others
are
light
enough
to
be
non
offensive
this
one
sits
poorly
it
has
a
similar
mouthfeel
to
seltzer
water
with
slightly
less
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
i
would
not
even
crack
open
in
an
emergency
i
find
it
strange
that
with
so
little
flavor
i
still
find
it
so
offensive
d
the
king
of
beers
i
have
to
say
i
was
biased
against
bud
and
other
american
adjuncts
for
awhile
but
lately
i
have
come
full
circle
i
just
recognize
the
value
in
these
brews
lately
they
are
refreshing
light
and
inexpensive
and
accompany
a
football
game
quite
nicely
dont
get
me
wrong
i
would
choose
any
sam
adams
beer
over
this
but
i
cant
hate
this
beer
for
the
price
i
think
its
pretty
darn
good
weve
all
drank
it
and
im
sure
had
mixed
feelings
in
my
opinion
its
not
as
bad
as
everyone
says
for
a
macro
lager
made
for
mass
consumption
it
has
more
flavor
than
one
should
expect
typical
appearance
for
a
lager
and
a
distinct
pretzel
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
which
is
its
best
quality
im
not
arguing
that
its
a
great
beer
just
good
for
what
it
is
at
barneys
beanery
you
cant
beat
the
3
00
budweiser
on
tap
special
in
all
reality
i
prefer
this
lager
over
heavyweights
as
heineken
pours
golden
yellow
slight
lace
only
knock
on
this
domestic
is
the
taste
enjoy
it
much
better
from
tap
than
from
a
can
or
a
bottle
food
match
not
much
out
there
that
wouldnt
completely
overpower
the
taste
of
this
beer
light
fare
it
is
then
grilled
chicken
with
a
green
salad
and
a
light
dressing
light
in
flavour
that
is
ok
so
im
not
going
to
shit
all
over
budweiser
because
when
it
comes
down
to
it
it
is
my
favorite
cheap
beer
i
must
say
that
if
im
picking
up
a
30rack
for
a
party
i
always
lean
towards
the
good
ol
bud
diesels
over
natty
or
coors
however
that
is
not
to
say
that
this
is
a
particularly
good
beer
if
i
had
to
give
it
an
adjective
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
bearable
beer
far
from
the
best
but
not
quite
at
the
bottom
of
the
pack
king
of
beers
eh
i
call
bullhit
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
regular
lager
glass
extremely
pale
even
more
pale
than
rolling
rock
which
claims
to
be
extra
pale
poured
pretty
aggressively
causing
a
1
inch
head
to
show
up
but
it
fizzled
away
immediately
smell
was
almost
nothing
except
maybe
some
grain
i
couldnt
smell
any
of
the
choicest
hops
or
best
barley
malt
it
claimed
to
have
on
the
bottle
taste
was
almost
nothing
except
maybe
some
grain
and
grassiness
theres
nothing
horrible
about
it
if
your
goal
is
to
get
drunk
you
can
slam
some
budweiser
pretty
easy
no
nasty
aftertaste
so
it
avoids
getting
an
f
due
to
its
affect
on
your
palette
i
recommend
reserving
this
beer
for
times
when
youre
specifically
only
going
to
be
enjoying
beer
without
food
or
after
a
meal
has
been
consumed
bud
light
may
be
the
superior
beverage
to
consume
with
food
but
budweiser
is
a
delicious
treat
all
on
its
own
i
enthusiastically
recommend
this
beer
to
all
of
my
friends
and
suggest
it
here
too
despite
its
faults
after
just
one
sip
youll
see
why
budweiser
is
americas
premier
beer
overall
a
little
more
robust
than
bud
light
very
light
and
refreshing
beer
fits
the
guidelines
all
in
all
i
feel
that
budweiser
deserves
its
spot
in
the
convenient
store
cooler
when
youre
kicking
it
with
your
buds
and
need
something
readily
available
to
get
wasted
on
budweiser
would
be
a
solid
choice
not
a
slam
but
definitely
avoid
this
beer
i
dont
know
why
there
is
so
much
popularity
of
it
maybe
mine
was
skunked
or
a
bad
batch
but
this
was
horrible
at
best
the
look
is
a
typical
american
lager
look
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
absolutely
horrid
overall
avoid
this
beer
and
go
for
some
coke
instead
caveat
i
always
rate
to
style
and
for
an
adjunct
lager
this
really
isnt
that
bad
it
is
closer
to
completely
average
a
little
lighter
on
flavour
than
its
canadian
competitors
but
it
probably
makes
up
for
this
in
drinkability
honestly
though
the
only
reason
i
bought
this
was
to
review
it
and
ill
probably
never
buy
bud
again
i
will
say
that
budweiser
is
my
favorite
of
the
major
american
names
bud
coors
miller
but
obviously
that
isnt
saying
much
i
can
deal
with
having
these
from
time
to
time
especially
if
my
options
are
bud
and
bud
light
although
water
would
do
too
or
soda
sometimes
you
just
want
an
unassuming
light
no
frills
beer
sometimes
o
oh
you
americans
stop
whining
please
be
thankful
that
at
least
you
have
this
en
masse
when
you
could
have
one
of
our
shitty
beers
overall
your
classic
lawnmower
beer
but
with
perhaps
a
bad
aftertaste
drink
enough
and
it
will
make
you
drunk
thats
the
best
i
can
say
for
this
yellowish
fermented
water
to
be
honest
i
can
barely
tell
the
difference
between
bud
coors
miller
and
any
other
american
domestic
swill
but
lets
be
honest
despite
the
commercials
they
really
arent
going
for
flavor
they
want
to
produce
the
most
beer
at
the
cheapest
expense
without
offending
your
senses
so
i
guess
their
market
share
has
proven
their
success
at
those
commercial
goals
good
for
them
budweiser
beer
is
truly
the
king
of
american
style
adjunct
lagers
it
tastes
the
way
it
should
taste
is
priced
the
way
it
should
be
priced
and
is
absolutely
one
of
the
most
consistent
beers
i
have
had
in
my
few
years
as
a
beer
drinker
o
this
stuff
is
disgusting
i
wont
drink
it
even
if
its
the
only
beer
at
a
party
im
25
and
so
is
one
of
my
good
friends
his
father
is
in
his
late
fifties
and
took
us
fishing
so
of
course
we
drank
good
old
bud
heavy
straight
out
of
the
can
is
how
this
was
drank
but
i
have
seen
many
buds
in
a
glass
so
i
know
there
is
decent
head
retention
at
first
but
that
fades
about
halfway
through
the
glass
nose
is
lightly
grainy
and
almost
sour
no
trace
of
hops
only
the
faint
cereal
and
adjunct
regularity
flavor
is
bitter
and
tingly
from
all
the
carbonation
best
served
ice
cold
because
the
sour
grains
will
ravage
your
palette
no
hops
again
in
the
flavor
just
the
plain
mildly
grainy
flavor
finishes
crisp
and
thirst
quenching
this
beer
serves
its
purpose
in
certain
situations
fishing
on
a
boat
baking
in
the
hot
sun
is
one
of
them
bland
overall
but
will
always
hold
a
ground
in
america
overall
it
is
really
not
a
terrible
beer
and
i
think
the
rating
should
be
much
higher
than
it
is
you
have
to
judge
the
beer
for
what
it
is
and
that
is
a
beer
for
the
mass
consumption
by
a
people
with
the
blandest
taste
in
food
and
drink
of
any
people
on
earth
by
that
standard
it
passes
with
flying
colors
for
those
of
us
who
desire
more
than
yes
you
should
look
elsewhere
like
most
people
i
imagine
ive
drank
my
fair
share
of
this
but
i
find
budweiser
to
be
just
plain
unpleasant
to
drink
this
to
me
is
among
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
for
macros
there
are
better
options
at
a
cheaper
price
king
of
beers
strong
statement
i
would
say
this
is
a
lager
that
is
over
priced
and
absolutely
not
the
king
of
beers
is
it
drinkable
sure
if
someone
offered
me
one
would
i
accept
sure
would
i
personally
go
buy
this
no
a
it
looks
like
a
beer
s
not
very
good
t
no
hops
detection
only
drinkable
if
its
very
cold
m
mouthfeel
is
ok
o
better
adjuct
lagers
out
there
would
never
buy
this
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
mainly
some
grass
and
corn
with
a
slight
woody
character
light
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
causing
the
beer
to
be
quite
refreshing
there
are
better
macros
but
bud
is
not
bad
drank
straight
from
the
can
lots
of
corn
rice
and
meal
smells
with
some
hops
and
bread
taste
was
grain
some
wet
grass
and
hops
and
malts
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
pure
well
carbonated
bud
is
what
it
is
and
they
make
it
very
well
its
not
a
bad
brew
and
every
once
in
awhile
i
enjoy
one
after
my
recent
tasting
of
bud
light
led
me
to
believe
that
my
standards
have
shifted
slightly
i
knew
i
had
to
review
this
beer
to
my
relief
its
pretty
much
what
i
remembered
its
an
average
macro
lager
there
are
better
and
cheaper
ones
out
there
but
this
is
not
embarrassingly
bad
i
may
never
drink
it
again
but
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
my
ability
to
swallow
24
ounces
of
this
without
gagging
makes
me
feel
like
less
of
a
beer
snob
overall
the
king
very
well
might
be
a
king
but
he
is
not
the
king
of
all
beer
he
spends
all
day
rolling
in
the
hay
cavorting
with
skunks
in
the
corn
fields
the
only
regularity
in
his
day
comes
with
his
morning
cereal
if
he
is
king
and
kate
is
queen
i
think
the
praying
mantis
does
it
right
the
king
is
a
playking
but
he
plays
well
beer
snobs
of
the
world
have
a
negative
opinion
but
where
ever
you
go
you
will
see
this
great
tasting
beer
being
sold
and
thats
the
bottom
line
theres
something
to
be
said
for
that
o
eh
not
much
to
say
about
the
self
styled
king
of
beers
good
enough
if
thats
all
thats
around
but
a
very
mediocre
brew
altogether
taste
and
looks
like
water
no
aroma
no
head
i
hear
its
very
hard
to
make
though
and
they
get
it
the
same
every
time
i
guess
that
is
one
positive
oh
and
they
do
have
good
commercials
o
not
very
enjoyable
wouldnt
be
having
this
if
anything
else
was
available
or
if
i
had
to
pay
for
it
overall
that
this
brew
dares
to
have
same
name
as
the
original
czech
budvar
with
just
the
tiniest
bit
of
self
respect
they
would
change
the
name
into
something
else
out
of
respect
for
the
czechs
this
beer
is
lightyears
away
from
their
quality
and
it
is
hardly
drinkable
d
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
six
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
i
dont
know
how
much
anyone
would
enjoy
that
o
well
i
thought
that
this
would
be
funny
its
actually
more
sad
than
anything
else
to
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
popular
beers
in
america
and
that
they
actually
make
a
light
version
of
thisand
its
even
more
popular
aaahhhh
im
very
happy
to
be
in
the
minority
there
pours
a
light
yellow
color
w
almost
zero
white
head
the
smell
is
that
of
corn
and
slight
malt
very
faint
taste
is
very
nondescript
w
the
corn
flavor
really
coming
out
very
waterlike
in
consistency
and
flavor
not
sure
why
anybody
who
really
enjoys
tasting
beer
would
drink
this
voluntarily
feel
is
super
thin
w
an
awful
aftertaste
which
thankfully
goes
away
quickly
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
for
anybody
who
really
enjoys
drinking
beer
id
rather
drink
water
or
iced
tea
if
this
is
my
only
option
very
light
pale
color
watery
slight
metallic
hop
flavor
and
a
little
corn
its
refreshing
ill
give
it
that
but
if
im
looking
for
flavor
with
my
refreshment
ill
go
elsewhere
its
a
typical
cheap
mass
produced
pale
lager
so
what
do
you
expect
final
thoughts
coming
in
with
a
unbiased
mind
it
helped
me
to
see
this
isnt
as
bad
as
i
had
thought
but
it
isnt
anywhere
as
good
as
even
the
lower
end
crafts
i
can
see
why
people
enjoy
it
its
very
easy
drinking
with
pretty
low
abv
not
the
best
by
a
long
shot
but
i
think
it
could
have
been
alot
worse
o
nope
in
the
batters
box
is
bud
lite
cant
imagine
whats
going
to
happen
here
drank
it
ice
cold
from
a
bottle
the
bottles
appearance
is
okay
i
guess
red
white
gold
blue
it
doesnt
smell
great
faintly
of
cooked
corn
full
flavored
but
in
not
good
way
concentrated
adjuncts
we
used
to
call
this
one
bud
heavy
as
i
recall
thats
still
a
good
name
the
taste
is
beyond
bad
a
lot
of
beers
get
knocked
on
hear
for
not
having
any
taste
particularly
the
huge
light
beers
coors
light
bud
light
etc
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
taste
with
budweiser
its
just
a
bad
taste
that
makes
me
want
to
drink
anything
else
but
the
smell
is
bland
but
with
a
decent
head
and
a
refreshing
taste
you
have
found
a
winner
in
budweiser
it
is
hands
down
the
best
macro
in
the
world
its
tough
to
rank
it
against
many
micros
because
different
times
call
for
different
brews
bbqs
baseball
games
concerts
etc
budweiser
cannot
be
beat
lounging
on
the
couch
at
a
relaxing
gathering
with
friends
maybe
it
can
be
beat
but
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
buy
for
any
circumstance
overall
a
below
average
beer
how
did
this
ever
become
so
popular
this
is
the
beer
id
steal
from
my
dad
need
to
review
it
had
warm
on
tap
at
concert
pours
a
pale
yellow
no
head
no
lacing
smells
of
corn
oil
taste
is
acrid
needs
to
be
cold
i
guzzled
one
on
line
for
restroom
so
i
wouldnt
have
to
prolong
the
agony
mouthfeel
is
off
tacky
needs
to
be
cold
easy
drinkin
though
yea
i
made
the
right
choice
to
mature
up
to
craft
o
certainly
not
my
beer
of
choice
but
i
would
never
turn
one
down
overall
what
more
to
say
its
just
a
bad
beer
of
course
compared
to
the
thousands
of
quality
beers
out
there
but
even
compared
to
other
bad
american
lagers
this
is
just
tasteless
and
borderline
offensive
the
fact
that
this
is
the
most
popular
beer
in
the
world
is
both
saddening
and
slightly
pathetic
o
budweiser
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
during
beer
pong
college
parties
and
whenever
its
the
last
brew
in
the
fridge
t
ill
take
this
over
bud
light
any
day
but
not
over
too
much
else
grains
malt
honey
and
a
strange
metallic
sourness
towards
the
finish
drinkable
but
not
exactly
memorable
the
average
american
adjunct
lager
no
more
no
less
no
good
though
to
be
fair
it
is
better
than
bud
light
and
bud
light
lime
so
theres
that
bad
beer
worse
than
busch
o
im
clearly
not
a
fan
of
the
companys
business
practices
or
their
swill
but
this
beer
isnt
offensive
its
just
not
good
the
one
thing
i
truly
take
away
from
this
beer
is
that
it
taste
like
just
beer
the
response
that
i
have
to
a
beer
seems
to
always
come
back
to
a
comparison
of
styles
to
budweiser
it
is
average
to
me
in
every
aspect
of
what
a
beer
is
the
label
is
the
most
impressive
feature
here
but
it
is
also
the
only
impressive
feature
not
an
attractive
beer
by
any
means
ill
need
help
running
through
the
case
will
likely
give
away
to
the
same
neighbor
even
still
ive
had
way
worse
have
to
hand
it
to
bud
for
putting
out
such
a
consistent
bland
product
for
the
masses
overall
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
tonight
hahaha
o
standard
macrobrew
content
yourself
for
what
it
is
certainly
not
the
worst
of
them
but
if
one
is
ever
stuck
it
would
do
it
has
been
quite
a
while
since
i
had
one
of
these
born
on
date
of
jan
06
2011
not
the
freshest
i
must
say
that
those
who
say
there
is
no
discernible
difference
in
taste
between
bud
bl
ml
coors
pbr
etc
are
flatout
wrong
this
bud
for
example
is
a
very
different
tasting
beer
compared
to
aals
that
i
am
more
acquainted
with
such
as
pbr
andor
narragansett
the
aroma
is
very
light
and
has
faint
sakelike
notes
of
rice
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
light
as
well
offering
almost
no
bitterness
but
lots
of
pale
crisp
dryness
and
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
punch
the
feel
is
sharply
effervescent
and
is
an
integral
part
of
the
overall
brew
not
the
best
beer
but
it
is
not
as
bad
as
say
bud
light
or
michelob
ultra
overall
for
a
flagship
beer
i
cant
for
the
life
of
me
figure
out
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
its
nearly
flavorless
and
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
another
in
any
way
this
beer
serves
its
purpose
well
as
a
thirst
quencher
no
offensively
bad
flavors
and
no
notable
good
ones
very
one
dimensional
and
plain
overall
serviceable
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
family
bbq
o
i
poured
this
brew
into
a
glass
but
drinking
it
out
of
a
can
is
almost
a
must
definitely
one
of
the
better
bmc
pairings
the
4th
of
july
can
is
the
shiz
best
can
ever
brew
is
best
served
ice
cold
overall
this
beer
is
just
good
for
beer
pong
really
wouldnt
enjoy
it
on
its
own
a
overall
a
very
weak
beer
especially
because
i
am
into
craftbeer
now
since
last
winter
would
work
well
while
sitting
outside
with
30
degrees
celsius
though
but
even
then
there
are
better
alternatives
o
just
as
bad
as
i
remember
it
not
very
flavorful
at
all
which
is
why
it
appeals
to
a
large
population
plenty
of
other
adjuncts
i
would
prefer
if
i
have
to
drink
one
so
i
am
sure
no
one
needs
to
read
these
reviews
anyways
but
the
beer
is
straw
yellow
a
half
finger
head
forms
the
smell
is
of
barely
taste
is
bitter
which
is
noticeable
immediately
and
remains
long
after
you
have
finished
the
beer
the
beer
tastes
and
looks
watered
down
but
really
its
just
lack
of
hop
flavoring
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
im
not
sure
it
deserves
the
across
the
board
1
scores
that
it
often
gets
sure
it
is
somewhat
offensive
smelling
and
if
served
at
any
temperature
above
ice
cold
it
doesnt
taste
much
better
than
it
smells
but
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
for
a
macro
beer
still
i
probably
wont
have
another
one
for
a
long
time
overall
this
is
absolutely
a
beer
to
avoid
just
poured
it
out
overall
i
suppose
this
is
a
pretty
fair
interpretation
of
the
standard
american
lager
style
on
a
personal
note
i
say
this
style
of
beer
sucks
on
a
more
personal
note
this
is
the
first
beer
i
can
remember
drinking
when
i
was
like
10
i
hated
it
and
it
would
be
the
last
beer
i
would
drink
for
like
five
or
six
years
had
that
first
beer
been
like
an
imperial
russian
stout
the
world
might
be
a
different
place
paired
with
chinese
food
o
when
im
in
the
mood
for
an
adjunct
lager
i
go
for
this
or
a
coors
light
they
both
are
very
inoffensive
and
clean
ill
drink
it
on
a
hot
summers
day
or
whenever
but
nothing
impressive
here
o
made
for
the
masses
not
for
the
few
the
proud
the
beer
advocates
overall
one
of
my
least
favorite
adjunct
lagers
and
least
favorite
beer
overall
next
to
corona
that
is
tasteless
to
a
large
degree
and
only
good
when
you
are
looking
for
something
cheap
to
play
beer
games
with
terrible
terrible
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
with
no
head
and
absolutely
no
lacing
the
only
reason
i
gave
this
obvious
detail
is
because
250
characters
were
required
smells
like
a
rotten
piece
of
beef
and
heavy
yeast
tastes
like
water
with
a
microbial
yeasty
finish
disgusting
beer
not
the
king
of
anything
seriously
bud
light
is
better
drinkability
the
epitome
of
american
lagerpilsners
very
basic
it
does
the
job
and
is
drinkable
yet
nothing
impressing
came
out
the
palest
of
yellows
with
a
thin
white
head
capping
it
off
no
lace
nose
was
dry
and
grainy
faint
citrus
and
husk
the
mouth
was
crisp
and
refreshing
excellent
feel
sweet
corn
lemon
zest
cheap
grains
make
up
the
flavor
profile
if
ever
i
were
to
get
this
beer
again
ontap
it
would
be
this
was
a
refreshing
and
simple
brew
good
one
to
wash
down
some
wings
verdict
not
surprisingly
im
not
going
to
be
ready
to
bow
down
to
this
king
any
time
soon
watery
boring
thin
and
too
sweet
budweiser
is
just
what
youd
expect
it
to
be
if
adjunct
lagers
are
your
thing
ud
be
a
fool
to
buy
this
not
much
better
than
carbonated
water
there
are
so
many
better
ones
out
there
ehhhemmm
pbr
yuengling
genesee
a
side
from
reviewing
purpose
ill
never
drink
this
again
mainly
due
to
there
ridiculous
advertisments
not
really
my
thing
overall
obviously
not
the
pinnacle
of
what
the
beer
industry
has
to
offer
but
i
think
that
there
are
worse
i
love
the
way
they
market
though
they
are
all
over
the
place
this
beer
is
nothing
fancy
its
a
domestic
very
easy
to
find
and
one
that
i
know
i
will
have
again
if
nothing
more
than
convenience
bottoms
up
and
hurry
up
you
dont
want
to
leave
the
taste
of
this
beer
in
your
mouth
for
long
add
a
lime
to
this
if
you
dont
mind
putting
fruit
in
your
beer
this
stuff
is
ok
basically
the
prototype
for
the
american
adjunct
lager
simply
put
this
stuff
is
the
definition
of
average
in
a
category
that
is
way
below
average
making
it
undesirable
overall
average
for
this
style
there
are
better
adjunct
lagers
you
get
a
very
subtle
slight
hop
taste
mixing
in
with
the
rice
taste
as
well
the
rice
taste
is
definitely
not
bad
at
all
though
i
really
detect
no
differences
between
the
on
tap
version
and
the
bottle
version
maybe
a
crisper
and
just
an
extreme
tad
bit
more
of
a
noticeable
hop
presence
which
really
is
approaching
zero
hop
taste
all
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
only
pick
it
if
theres
nothing
else
but
the
light
versions
of
the
big
3
companies
overall
i
really
probably
should
have
left
this
piss
in
the
bottle
at
least
it
might
have
retained
a
bit
of
carbonation
the
only
redeeming
quality
about
this
beer
is
that
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
water
not
all
the
creative
marketing
in
the
world
can
get
me
to
drink
this
beer
if
there
are
other
choices
this
beer
gives
me
headaches
like
champaign
the
color
is
surprise
golden
clear
with
bubbles
the
smell
and
taste
are
grainiy
mouth
feel
is
fine
just
cant
handle
the
headaches
o
it
is
what
it
is
flavorless
and
crisp
thankfully
this
will
be
my
last
and
only
experience
with
this
beer
clear
yellow
body
with
white
frothy
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
adjuncts
grain
and
some
hops
taste
is
very
similar
to
its
aroma
sweet
adjunct
grain
rice
subtle
hops
towards
the
finish
a
somewhat
coating
sugar
remains
on
the
palate
light
fizzy
body
the
best
of
the
adjunct
lagers
but
not
the
end
all
be
all
of
beer
that
too
many
people
believe
it
is
better
than
bud
light
at
least
but
seriously
water
pour
doesnt
start
off
that
bad
light
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
slightly
vegetal
slightly
sweet
and
really
hard
to
pick
up
im
able
to
pick
up
the
vegetal
feel
even
more
in
the
taste
along
with
that
slight
sweetness
no
presence
of
hops
it
certainly
isnt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
drank
but
it
is
far
from
the
best
either
o
extremely
mass
production
tasteless
adjunct
lager
no
soul
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
it
also
doesnt
have
a
strong
taste
of
anything
but
still
more
so
than
some
others
the
taste
was
clean
and
crackery
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
green
apple
note
nothing
foul
but
nothing
outstanding
the
beer
serves
two
purposes
to
cool
you
down
on
a
hot
day
and
to
wash
down
food
ive
had
my
fair
share
of
the
king
because
somebody
close
to
me
will
drink
nothing
else
id
never
gotten
around
to
reviewing
it
because
when
i
spend
time
with
these
people
its
precious
and
i
think
that
even
though
this
is
monstrously
watered
down
beer
many
times
having
a
beer
is
about
much
more
than
the
liquid
the
king
of
beers
the
great
american
lager
the
ultimate
ta
tvad
beer
yes
crap
in
a
bottle
all
the
way
i
give
it
a
0
1
because
censored
for
ba
pours
light
strawyellow
smells
of
metallic
stale
urine
and
tastes
about
the
same
with
maybe
some
small
semblance
of
a
hop
in
there
somewhere
light
and
nonrefreshing
leaving
a
metallic
unpleasant
aftertaste
obviously
to
be
avoided
pours
a
small
one
finger
head
the
body
is
completely
see
through
yellow
and
lots
of
carbonation
the
head
is
already
gone
oh
goody
small
possibility
of
lacing
we
shall
see
overall
the
appearance
is
pretty
bad
nothing
good
to
speak
of
here
looks
like
a
crappy
american
adjunct
lager
on
the
nose
i
get
that
sour
adjunct
lager
smell
maybe
some
sweet
malt
in
there
somewhere
no
hops
to
speak
of
maybe
its
the
fact
that
ive
had
way
too
many
adjunct
lagers
recently
or
maybe
its
budweiser
beer
but
bud
and
bud
light
have
seemed
especially
boring
on
the
smell
and
taste
like
nothing
to
them
at
all
wow
i
actually
think
i
like
bud
light
more
and
thats
hard
to
say
there
is
almost
no
taste
here
at
all
i
would
almost
venture
as
far
as
to
say
that
they
just
made
the
same
beer
and
slapped
two
different
labels
on
it
i
mean
i
get
that
sour
adjunct
taste
and
some
malt
and
thats
it
the
rest
is
water
yeah
there
is
just
nothing
else
to
this
beer
pretty
weak
beer
is
it
easy
to
drink
yes
is
it
the
worst
flavor
ever
close
to
it
but
its
not
a
busch
i
mean
i
feel
like
a
broken
record
im
saying
the
exact
same
thing
about
bud
as
i
did
about
bud
light
cause
they
are
the
same
fing
beer
mouthfeel
is
atrocious
too
much
carbonation
and
super
thin
and
watery
all
around
drinkability
is
ok
but
just
because
its
so
watery
i
mean
the
only
difference
between
these
two
beers
is
that
i
got
ok
lacing
in
the
bud
light
and
ok
to
bad
lacing
in
the
bud
overall
what
more
can
i
say
bud
light
with
worse
lacing
im
happy
to
say
i
only
have
one
more
bud
beer
to
review
avoid
avoid
avoid
d
like
i
said
earlier
american
adjunct
lager
is
far
from
my
favorite
beer
style
i
guess
if
i
was
forced
to
drink
the
style
this
would
be
toward
the
top
of
my
choices
would
be
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
still
not
sure
i
should
have
soiled
my
stone
nonic
with
it
though
o
purchased
for
the
sole
fact
that
it
was
2
at
bar
not
doing
that
again
was
not
impressed
with
budweiser
first
time
having
it
in
years
and
will
not
try
again
for
a
long
time
mo
very
fizzy
and
crisp
actually
quite
refreshing
even
though
i
give
this
beer
a
poor
review
we
all
know
its
a
cheap
macro
beer
it
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
crap
beers
ill
take
this
and
pbr
over
most
adjunct
lagers
especially
over
coors
and
coors
light
gross
so
if
im
on
a
budget
and
headed
to
a
boozer
theres
a
damn
good
chance
im
walking
out
with
a
616oz
pack
of
bud
ah
yes
the
king
of
beers
this
was
given
to
me
at
a
family
gathering
and
i
accepted
even
though
i
wasnt
thrilled
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
traditional
straw
pale
yellow
with
a
little
white
head
really
nothing
to
rave
about
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
but
doesnt
have
anything
but
a
malt
backbone
screaming
at
you
the
mouthfeel
is
drinkable
and
light
m
im
a
sucker
for
good
popping
carbonation
nothing
really
else
here
for
me
drinkability
budweiser
walks
a
fine
line
between
being
an
acceptable
light
american
lager
and
generic
bland
fizz
water
the
experience
can
be
pretty
dry
and
dehydrating
once
you
start
to
pound
them
and
get
used
to
the
taste
it
becomes
much
easier
to
drink
definitely
more
drinkable
than
miller
and
coors
original
just
not
as
flavorful
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
it
does
work
as
a
highly
drinkable
generic
beer
a
crowd
pleaser
drinkability
just
not
that
good
i
can
drink
it
and
i
dont
hate
it
but
it
doesnt
really
bring
anything
to
the
table
d
aside
from
the
taste
this
was
a
half
decent
beer
sadly
beers
need
to
taste
good
budweiser
is
a
solid
brew
of
course
it
is
quite
favorable
to
rip
this
beer
but
i
wont
do
that
with
the
advent
and
popularity
of
light
beer
budweiser
must
stand
above
and
beyond
this
budweiser
is
a
smooth
highly
drinkable
beer
its
not
necessarily
the
most
boldly
flavorful
brew
but
it
is
tasty
and
made
with
with
the
utmost
of
care
say
what
you
want
to
say
but
anheuser
busch
does
get
high
marks
for
quality
control
crisp
consistent
refreshing
that
is
budweiser
overall
well
it
is
what
it
is
it
really
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
is
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
adjunct
lager
category
this
particular
can
was
given
to
me
at
a
friends
house
and
i
didnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wouldnt
have
bought
it
for
myself
d
there
just
isnt
enough
here
to
bring
me
back
for
another
this
one
was
left
over
from
a
party
and
i
decided
to
give
it
a
crack
far
from
the
worst
beer
but
nothing
worth
drinking
beyond
the
sheer
alcohol
effects
value
horrible
should
be
1
99
per
sixer
but
its
actually
almost
as
much
as
yeungling
a
good
test
beer
if
someone
says
they
like
this
one
they
sure
dont
know
beer
d
it
has
high
drinkability
cause
its
as
easy
to
drink
as
water
you
could
fly
through
a
case
of
these
and
not
even
know
it
and
possibly
not
enjoy
it
i
loved
bud
years
ago
before
i
tried
a
real
beer
now
i
can
barely
drink
it
it
has
a
watery
quickly
dissolving
head
nice
clear
yellow
color
but
when
you
use
40
rice
and
corn
its
probably
easy
to
achieve
the
smell
is
pretty
bad
no
richness
or
malt
aroma
tastes
like
seltzer
water
and
cornmeal
mixed
together
its
really
sad
that
this
is
the
number
one
beer
in
america
sad
quite
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
if
i
can
call
it
that
i
call
it
co2
with
alcohol
and
water
basically
dr
cheap
enough
in
america
would
i
drink
it
again
not
over
most
cheaper
american
macros
if
i
were
looking
to
get
drunk
stick
to
steel
gravity
high
reserve
if
youre
sacrificing
taste
to
get
locked
elsewise
lads
truth
be
told
this
tastes
like
what
i
imagine
your
urine
would
taste
like
after
having
a
real
beer
to
its
credit
it
should
be
said
that
5
00
is
a
fair
bit
above
the
standard
4
3
of
many
beers
d
to
me
in
order
to
be
really
drinkable
a
beer
has
not
just
to
be
quaffable
it
has
got
to
have
some
character
to
make
things
interesting
this
is
just
quaffable
an
easy
drink
but
it
cannot
get
more
than
3
overall
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
horrifying
i
mean
its
by
no
means
a
good
beer
but
if
it
were
the
last
beer
on
earth
i
would
still
drink
it
it
isnt
that
bad
but
it
certainly
isnt
the
last
beer
on
earth
and
i
sure
hope
it
wont
be
drinkability
its
a
smooth
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavours
and
aromas
this
beer
lacks
alot
of
flavours
and
i
wouldnt
even
drink
this
to
get
drunk
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
anything
special
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
in
both
flavor
and
body
not
bad
for
an
american
lager
but
also
not
something
i
would
buy
too
often
only
when
im
low
on
cash
and
cant
afford
anything
more
interesting
d
for
5
it
goes
down
easy
not
my
favorite
american
adjunct
lager
but
it
isnt
the
worst
d
i
have
no
problem
drinking
macro
beers
i
often
do
when
im
with
friends
but
there
is
something
about
budweiser
that
makes
me
cringe
the
only
time
i
can
even
finish
a
bud
is
if
its
ice
cold
and
i
chug
it
i
also
feel
like
bud
light
has
more
taste
and
more
of
a
body
to
it
when
standing
next
to
its
cousins
this
one
is
not
the
worst
period
just
bad
avoid
drinking
this
one
even
if
its
beer
pong
do
they
really
still
do
fuckin
beechwood
aging
that
must
be
a
fuck
of
a
lot
of
beechwood
do
they
hire
a
bunch
of
drifters
to
comb
the
shoreline
everyday
for
new
pieces
of
wood
this
beechwood
claim
is
highly
suspect
drink
i
dont
suggest
it
to
anyone
i
dont
buy
it
unless
i
need
a
lot
of
cheap
beer
i
can
say
that
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
and
that
under
the
right
conditions
i
think
it
is
just
fine
ive
decided
to
edit
this
review
as
this
beer
really
has
got
worse
the
more
i
drink
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
why
would
you
i
finished
this
in
23
gulps
low
abv
makes
this
something
only
good
for
drinking
games
lawnmowing
or
your
kids
friends
when
they
stop
by
i
definitely
will
not
have
this
beer
on
my
list
as
a
havetohave
i
can
think
of
at
least
five
other
adjuncts
that
i
would
rather
have
but
ifwhen
i
am
in
the
position
to
have
another
i
most
likely
would
not
pass
one
up
drinkability
3rd
to
bud
light
and
bud
select
in
drinkability
but
awesome
can
enjoy
slam
or
have
anytime
of
the
day
had
three
in
a
row
and
will
now
switch
to
a
bud
select
to
see
how
this
tastes
on
tap
yuk
overall
the
budweiser
lasted
about
half
the
glass
before
getting
drain
poured
which
is
better
than
the
bl
it
was
more
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
it
was
vaguely
recognizable
as
beer
and
had
some
sparkle
to
it
also
on
tap
the
beer
was
a
bit
warmer
than
normal
out
of
a
cold
bottle
when
the
temperature
hides
some
of
the
flavor
it
is
much
easier
to
drink
for
a
standard
every
day
beer
the
king
of
beers
isnt
all
that
bad
sure
it
lacks
anything
extraordinary
but
this
beer
does
go
down
smooth
and
is
surprisingly
drinkable
this
is
my
go
to
standard
beer
this
beer
seems
to
me
to
be
less
carbonated
than
the
rest
of
the
beers
around
it
such
as
bud
light
pbr
miller
and
icehouse
i
respect
this
beer
simply
for
the
fact
that
it
has
endured
and
i
myself
could
never
really
say
no
to
a
budweiser
unless
there
was
some
ipa
or
belgian
style
goodness
around
serving
type
bottle
it
is
what
it
is
this
beer
is
average
at
best
and
im
sure
thats
what
anheuserbusch
want
it
to
be
i
would
never
buy
this
stuff
but
maybe
its
mostly
because
im
not
a
big
fan
of
light
lager
as
an
adjunct
lager
its
really
not
all
that
bad
ive
had
much
worse
an
averagely
drinkable
average
tasting
beer
for
average
people
who
enjoy
average
things
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
negative
reviews
on
here
but
overall
for
the
money
i
think
its
an
ok
beer
has
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
distinct
smooth
taste
ive
had
it
from
a
bottle
can
and
on
tap
each
time
i
feel
that
if
its
fresh
it
taste
smooth
dwell
we
know
you
okay
some
people
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
so
technically
its
drinkable
in
the
same
way
that
arbor
mist
is
a
drinkable
wine
overall
its
no
king
of
beers
but
a
beer
that
never
lets
me
down
tasty
and
drinkable
then
again
its
a
great
bet
if
you
are
drinking
through
a
funnel
drinkability
if
you
want
to
pound
down
some
beers
and
dont
want
flavor
getting
in
the
way
this
is
the
beer
for
you
not
for
me
though
finishing
one
was
a
trying
time
for
me
well
i
guess
if
you
can
stomach
very
easy
to
drink
as
it
lacks
all
things
beer
d
this
for
me
is
the
one
of
the
worst
american
macroadjunct
lagers
out
there
if
you
love
people
do
not
get
suckered
into
buying
this
for
a
party
d4
5
for
sure
you
could
rip
these
all
day
long
at
the
beach
that
is
this
beers
intention
and
for
that
i
am
rewarding
it
summary
this
is
a
good
beer
i
gave
it
7
810
or
c
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
after
drinking
bud
light
for
several
years
i
imagined
this
to
be
a
commercial
beer
flavored
water
overall
this
is
something
you
can
down
on
a
hot
summer
day
otherwise
its
best
to
stay
away
from
this
beer
drinkability
well
it
gets
props
for
ease
of
drinkability
though
desire
to
drink
more
is
really
nonexistent
there
is
nothing
compelling
that
really
entertains
the
idea
of
another
d
it
is
what
it
is
a
mass
produced
lager
that
tastes
pretty
awful
compared
to
abundance
of
great
beers
out
there
dit
is
what
it
is
a
standard
american
lager
light
easy
drinking
and
fairly
tame
in
both
hops
and
malt
not
my
glass
of
beer
but
i
applaud
ab
for
their
high
standards
that
they
assign
to
their
beers
no
flaws
and
consistent
everytime
note
if
i
reviewed
to
the
style
which
is
probably
the
best
way
to
review
this
would
get
slightly
higher
marks
but
since
i
already
tend
to
review
more
to
my
tastes
than
to
the
style
i
believe
i
should
stay
consistent
with
my
history
and
review
to
my
tastes
i
will
say
that
as
far
as
american
adjunct
lagers
go
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
a
budweiser
overall
i
am
not
going
to
slam
this
beer
like
others
have
its
a
beer
made
for
the
masses
and
isnt
that
bad
ab
has
been
making
this
for
a
long
time
and
are
consistent
with
the
final
product
drinkability
i
dont
even
find
it
as
drinkable
as
u
would
expect
a
watered
down
light
beer
to
be
its
not
that
its
heavy
or
has
any
unique
blast
of
flavor
its
simply
not
a
good
taste
and
not
a
good
beer
to
drink
thats
my
opinion
anyways
like
i
always
say
once
you
cross
the
sacred
river
over
to
the
land
of
craft
brew
you
must
leave
this
beer
behind
drinkability
i
cant
stomach
this
beer
not
just
because
im
a
beer
snob
ill
at
least
admit
to
that
but
because
this
beer
has
nothing
to
it
this
is
a
beer
youd
drink
if
all
you
wanted
was
to
get
drunk
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
these
though
id
take
a
sam
adams
or
heineken
over
these
anyday
but
theyre
good
for
a
cheap
grab
of
course
budweiser
is
the
beer
thats
cool
to
hate
among
people
here
who
compare
it
against
completely
different
styles
of
richer
darker
hoppy
microbrews
beers
but
i
love
it
and
im
not
afraid
to
admit
thats
its
a
fine
well
made
and
consistently
refreshing
brew
most
likely
the
second
most
consumed
beer
in
the
usa
but
must
be
because
of
the
amount
of
exposure
it
receives
in
advertising
two
finger
head
of
white
froth
with
no
lasting
power
lace
has
some
cling
but
not
for
long
color
matches
a
4
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smells
of
corn
wheat
and
barley
taste
is
muted
cereal
grains
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
water
in
my
mouth
good
for
yard
work
is
refreshing
but
not
much
more
flavor
than
water
just
more
kick
d
watery
lacking
in
flavor
rank
musty
hard
to
drink
d
can
easily
buy
a
12
pack
and
drink
the
whole
thing
cheap
beer
more
for
parties
d
if
youre
looking
to
get
a
quick
drink
of
nothing
special
at
about
3
004
50
you
can
get
a
40oz
of
this
cheep
beer
its
nothing
i
would
consider
as
a
top
10
a
top
15
even
but
at
the
same
time
its
beer
i
grabbed
this
beer
with
high
hopes
i
have
never
really
had
it
before
its
my
first
brew
of
2011
hopefully
the
worst
straight
from
the
bottle
tastes
sweet
light
malt
dont
pick
up
any
corn
but
for
the
matter
hops
are
missing
as
well
smell
is
minimal
sweet
light
malt
overloaded
on
carbonation
which
is
par
for
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
one
of
the
macros
ill
enjoy
freely
but
nothing
exceptional
edit
this
gets
worse
as
it
goes
wow
smh
d
nah
next
time
i
shall
reach
for
the
bottle
of
red
wine
sitting
there
this
is
another
beer
to
mow
and
play
golf
with
it
is
good
for
that
at
least
i
usually
have
this
in
cans
when
i
do
have
it
and
it
tastes
fine
smells
ok
drinks
well
and
is
cheap
and
easy
to
find
it
is
like
the
rest
of
these
mass
produced
beers
i
would
not
drink
it
again
the
taste
of
very
light
malt
w
slight
rice
sweetness
and
grainy
quality
begins
the
mild
effect
on
the
palate
the
slight
taste
of
pilsner
malt
is
there
but
overwhelmed
by
crisp
rice
taste
so
faint
it
almost
is
as
if
it
isnt
added
for
the
taste
a
pretty
bland
experience
to
me
overall
just
ok
if
no
other
better
options
are
available
too
light
and
thin
for
the
style
it
may
work
to
quench
or
as
a
palate
cleanser
with
greasy
food
but
it
really
is
poor
and
lackluster
drinkability
tastewise
overall
extremely
mediocre
beer
when
i
began
drinking
beer
i
started
with
this
and
stopped
after
trying
other
beers
it
is
drinkable
but
whats
the
point
when
thats
the
only
good
feature
visit
my
beer
blog
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
perfect
if
youve
mowed
your
lawn
and
your
fridge
is
empty
overall
if
youve
never
had
one
id
say
its
your
duty
as
an
american
if
u
are
one
to
drink
this
beer
at
least
once
ill
give
it
this
at
least
its
substantially
better
than
bud
light
but
hey
king
of
beers
where
do
they
get
that
nerve
budweiser
pours
crystal
yellow
off
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
except
you
should
have
one
once
in
your
life
to
remind
you
why
brewers
use
real
ingredients
and
pride
in
their
products
this
is
default
beer
for
beer
ignorance
yeah
its
mass
marketed
it
really
doesnt
look
that
great
smell
is
just
below
average
but
man
can
you
drink
these
budweiser
is
what
it
is
its
not
trying
to
impress
anyone
its
just
that
beer
thay
you
and
your
friends
are
sharing
pitchers
of
at
the
bar
when
1am
rolls
around
couldnt
think
of
a
better
beer
to
hoist
in
the
air
as
neil
diamond
sings
sweet
caroline
budweiser
isnt
ground
breaking
but
it
is
good
times
and
a
way
of
american
life
kind
of
a
funky
aftertaste
a
little
too
light
and
almost
a
funky
off
fruity
flavor
its
been
years
since
i
have
had
a
bud
its
not
horrible
but
its
not
that
great
either
budweiser
is
and
always
has
been
a
staple
of
the
american
lifestyle
that
said
i
do
not
like
the
beer
the
only
time
i
drink
it
anymore
is
between
shifts
when
i
know
there
is
nothing
in
the
fridge
at
home
steer
clear
if
possible
but
if
you
find
yourself
in
one
of
those
holeinthewall
joints
give
the
classic
a
try
the
tequilla
you
ask
it
does
a
great
job
of
clearing
the
bud
out
of
your
mouth
and
enough
will
actually
make
you
forget
that
you
ever
subjected
yourself
to
to
this
dissappointingly
lame
brew
overall
for
its
style
i
think
its
hard
to
beat
it
is
much
less
musty
and
malty
than
others
of
the
style
which
i
think
makes
it
much
more
enjoyable
like
i
said
not
a
beer
conisseurs
go
to
but
its
also
not
terrible
d
nice
beer
for
the
style
easy
drinker
best
when
served
cold
not
as
bad
as
some
people
advocate
a
least
it
is
a
real
beer
and
not
some
watered
down
light
beer
the
great
american
lager
obsessed
with
destroying
any
other
beer
that
does
not
look
like
urine
has
dispatched
thousands
of
remote
probes
into
the
far
reaches
of
space
needless
to
say
i
am
not
a
fan
of
budweiser
the
beer
borders
on
exceptional
in
appearance
always
clear
and
clean
looking
that
is
the
high
point
of
this
beer
though
the
aroma
is
sour
the
taste
is
bland
the
mouthfeel
is
like
water
and
the
beer
to
me
is
not
to
be
classified
as
drinkable
so
there
my
last
review
was
reactionary
this
one
is
fair
itd
be
damn
dishonest
to
say
this
is
anywhere
near
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
but
its
not
very
good
even
for
what
it
tries
to
be
why
the
king
of
beers
this
is
actually
a
quite
poor
beer
it
smells
like
metallic
diluted
cornrice
water
the
taste
is
not
much
better
way
too
much
rice
which
compromises
the
taste
which
there
is
little
of
if
you
want
a
cheap
beer
in
the
big
3
go
with
miller
high
life
i
understand
that
this
is
the
king
of
beers
and
one
of
the
best
selling
beers
in
the
world
that
being
said
i
did
not
really
care
for
this
beer
this
beer
was
a
little
too
light
for
my
taste
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
body
it
had
very
little
flavor
in
fact
it
just
tasted
like
tap
water
the
alcohol
was
the
only
thing
that
reminded
me
i
was
drinking
beer
with
out
a
doubt
there
are
better
beers
out
there
however
if
someone
were
to
offer
me
a
bud
i
wouldnt
refuse
after
all
that
just
wouldnt
be
good
etiquette
my
first
beers
were
primarily
foreign
beers
that
is
i
never
paid
much
attention
to
american
ones
when
i
tried
budweiser
i
was
very
impressed
i
think
a
lot
of
people
on
this
website
might
be
rating
bud
low
because
they
are
beer
snobs
and
know
they
have
to
because
they
have
a
reputation
to
uphold
overall
a
fair
brew
certainly
doesnt
live
up
to
the
name
the
great
american
lager

this

a

beer
how
the
hell
this

the
most
popular
beer
on

is
beyond

only
way
id
drink
this
is
if
there
was

thekingofwichitaoct

overall
about
what
i
expected
but
still
a
disappointment
its
just
amazing
how
much
of
this
stuff
gets
produced
and
consumed
on
a
daily
basis
beer
5
in
the
swill
tour
2010
it
pours
a
clear
pale
jaundice
topped
by
some
healthy
white
suds
the
nose
is
of
puffed
rice
tears
and
crappy
wheat
the
taste
is
of
orphans
disappointment
on
the
days
that
potential
parents
come
to
browse
the
selection
its
just
corny
water
damn
the
body
couldnt
really
be
much
lighter
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
this
is
really
just
cornflavored
ricewater
not
really
beer
d
at
5
i
could
drink
the
beer
all
day
long
im
not
inclined
to
but
in
a
pinch
or
at
2
per
pint
its
hard
to
pass
up
it
pours
an
super
pale
golden
color
the
smell
is
of
corn
and
rice
gone
wrong
this
incites
beer
pong
memories
of
old
there
is
a
vomit
like
wheat
tone
to
it
as
well
ive
had
this
before
but
i
believe
the
ignorance
that
i
brought
to
drinking
it
allowed
me
to
consume
it
the
taste
isnt
all
of
that
wonderful
but
at
least
its
smooth
the
crappiness
of
the
hops
do
not
do
it
too
much
justice
but
it
is
sadly
drinkable
so
i
cant
say
too
much
bad
about
it
eh
its
budweiser
lets
be
honest
with
ourselves
here
this
isnt
beer
genius
however
it
is
dependable
and
it
certainly
blows
most
of
its
brethren
out
of
the
water
if
youre
stuck
at
a
party
with
no
craft
brew
in
sight
this
is
your
back
up
this
is
by
far
the
best
macro
lager
i
dont
care
what
anybody
says
easy
to
drink
and
reasonably
tasty
if
your
fucked
up
the
drinkabilty
of
this
beer
is
good
considering
its
price
sure
there
are
better
beers
out
there
but
then
again
you
get
what
you
pay
for
drinkability
due
to
its
low
abv
you
can
knock
back
many
of
these
and
all
youd
get
was
bored
its
relatively
bland
but
its
kind
of
what
you
expect
from
anheuserbusch
drinkability
this
beer
is
technically
drinkable
and
i
aim
to
drink
the
whole
can
out
of
fairness
or
something
still
not
an
experience
id
relish
repeating
at
a
pig
roast
and
was
one
of
two
choices
the
other
being
miller
lite
so
i
cracked
open
an
icy
cold
can
super
light
straw
color
aroma
of
corn
and
additives
taste
was
bland
and
watery
compared
to
a
real
beer
but
not
so
offensive
i
suppose
the
best
thing
about
this
king
of
beers
is
the
easy
waterlike
drinkability
when
washing
down
barbecue
had
this
many
times
in
many
of
its
bottlingcanning
derivatives
but
tonight
im
having
it
ontap
at
the
local
round
table
pizza
with
the
company
of
a
king
arthur
supreme
a
60
oz
pitcher
to
share
with
my
wife
in
2
chilled
mugs
light
and
fizzy
average
on
smell
seems
worse
on
taste
ive
had
this
beer
so
many
times
but
it
seems
to
taste
dirtier
the
more
i
drink
it
the
so
called
king
of
beers
but
there
are
many
better
definitely
should
be
reserved
for
gas
station
desperation
purchases
but
is
always
surprisingly
decent
i
had
two
buds
the
other
day
one
was
warm
the
other
cold
obviously
cold
is
better
but
both
were
alright
by
me
sometimes
i
get
wrapped
up
in
getting
the
good
stuff
and
forget
that
the
cheap
stuff
is
often
not
too
far
behind
that
being
said
this
beer
does
not
look
or
smell
impressive
at
all
sometimes
it
does
not
really
matter
this
beer
pours
with
a
very
clear
straw
colour
and
a
head
that
lasts
but
10n
seconds
with
almost
no
further
carbonation
it
had
very
little
smell
it
has
a
fairly
weak
flavour
but
there
is
something
there
just
before
the
aftertaste
although
im
not
sure
what
drink
this
when
you
want
to
get
drunk
taste
is
mostly
carbonation
sting
ending
with
some
corn
grain
flavor
doesnt
feel
or
taste
bad
but
doesnt
feel
or
taste
good
it
is
drinkable
like
water
is
mindless
little
flavor
d
obviously
this
is
not
the
king
of
beers
however
i
dont
think
its
that
bad
dont
get
me
wrong
i
wont
be
buying
6
packs
of
bud
anytime
soon
however
if
served
ice
cold
and
in
the
proper
social
setting
i
wont
refuse
to
drink
a
few
of
these
as
far
as
american
adjuncts
go
there
are
worse
ones
out
there
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
near
the
top
with
a
foamy
paper
white
head
that
rises
quickly
and
falls
to
nothing
corn
and
rice
in
the
aroma
with
no
semblance
of
hops
the
flavor
or
lack
thereof
is
more
corn
and
rice
and
is
extremely
watered
down
carbonation
is
high
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
a
little
bit
of
corn
in
the
finish
this
is
just
a
boring
beer
its
not
as
terrible
as
some
of
its
counterparts
but
it
just
does
not
impress
by
any
stretch
this
is
not
the
worst
thing
ever
in
its
abomination
of
a
beer
style
i
feel
that
budweiser
actually
holds
up
pretty
well
dont
get
me
wrong
though
i
never
want
to
drink
another
one
but
rating
to
style
this
is
pretty
ok
i
did
not
rate
this
poorly
because
it
is
a
corporate
beer
it
is
just
not
a
high
caliber
beer
pours
a
straw
yellow
without
small
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quick
enough
no
lacing
at
all
has
an
almost
metallic
smell
to
it
with
faint
grainy
aroma
i
get
that
im
supposed
to
rate
to
style
but
this
beer
isnt
tasty
it
isnt
the
most
horrible
thing
either
carbonation
very
prickly
making
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
harsh
and
made
me
want
to
stop
drinking
drinkability
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
goes
down
easy
if
your
looking
for
a
refreshing
drinkable
beer
this
is
it
would
take
it
over
coors
any
day
otherwise
stick
with
the
craft
brews
for
fuller
flavor
and
body
not
saying
that
craft
brews
are
not
refreshing
and
drinkable
they
definitely
are
but
just
a
little
heavier
it
also
depends
on
the
meal
you
wish
to
drink
with
i
dunno
gonna
rate
this
to
style
as
i
have
probaly
had
about
ten
thousand
of
these
and
think
for
aal
you
really
cant
do
much
better
it
doesnt
smell
offenseive
it
looks
ok
it
tastes
refreshing
and
clean
you
can
do
alot
worse
than
bud
lemme
tell
ya
drinkability
it
is
what
it
is
probably
the
beers
best
quality
drinkability
buds
drinkability
is
another
one
of
its
highlights
its
quite
refreshing
mild
with
an
interesting
blend
of
flavors
that
makes
it
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
it
is
an
excellent
choice
to
serve
with
salty
snacks
or
a
bbq
meal
well
its
easy
to
drink
and
does
not
leave
a
lot
for
your
senses
this
is
actually
the
3
5
version
for
the
swedish
market
brewed
in
the
uk
a
bit
less
sweetalcoholic
than
its
big
brother
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
just
another
cheap
american
beer
heavily
carbonated
and
not
heavily
flavored
slightly
watery
when
compared
to
fancier
types
and
the
only
thing
that
keeps
this
beer
going
is
its
connection
to
america
and
patriotism
d
meh
on
tap
its
not
a
terrible
adjunct
better
than
light
beer
average
adjunct
pale
average
color
simple
aroma
of
beer
standard
runofthemill
favor
a
plain
simple
beer
for
a
regular
workaday
mood
id
have
to
say
this
is
a
consistently
brewed
beer
from
which
my
relative
tastes
refer
when
i
feel
like
i
dont
want
to
notice
much
flavor
from
my
beer
this
is
my
standby
drinkability
i
think
this
is
horrible
better
than
bud
light
but
still
a
statement
that
they
care
more
about
marketing
than
their
actual
beer
i
use
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
but
since
they
sold
out
to
inbev
i
have
for
the
most
part
abstained
from
purchasing
this
it
use
to
be
my
american
megabrewery
goto
beer
in
a
can
but
not
anymore
mostly
i
drink
it
for
nostalgia
sake
anheuserbush
is
not
an
exclusively
american
controlled
company
anymore
so
skip
the
all
american
patriotism
talk
i
drink
this
with
a
heavy
heart
why
couldnt
ab
remain
american
wwwhhhyyy
libation
what
is
there
to
say
its
a
standard
macro
adjunct
lager
its
not
good
and
i
will
probably
never
drink
it
again
soft
light
enough
in
the
nose
where
rice
is
felt
as
so
often
in
american
adjunct
lagers
quite
mild
in
flavor
supported
by
a
slight
hop
and
not
really
exceptional
it
offers
a
mouth
where
the
average
bitterness
sounds
a
bit
artificial
when
it
is
not
simply
nonexistent
there
is
a
small
taste
of
the
flavors
of
rice
but
unfortunately
no
real
appetite
drinkability
this
one
tasted
a
bit
too
sweet
and
i
suspect
that
its
too
old
still
budweiser
is
an
alright
macro
beer
and
extremely
drinkable
far
from
a
first
choice
i
dont
mind
getting
this
one
from
time
to
time
for
get
togethers
or
just
for
the
hell
of
it
it
is
what
it
is
d
might
as
well
drink
a
water
with
lemon
in
it
go
to
any
restaurant
and
theyll
give
you
water
with
lemon
for
free
i
dont
know
why
anyone
would
even
drop
a
dime
on
this
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
worthy
of
respect
but
it
is
repellingly
boring
when
most
individuals
think
of
beer
they
think
of
bud
this
is
the
original
and
any
beer
drinker
should
have
a
sip
of
budweiser
you
wont
be
that
impressed
but
youll
be
happy
to
know
that
your
beer
tasting
can
only
get
better
pours
a
cat
piss
yellow
with
a
decent
head
which
dissipates
quickly
at
first
sip
it
taste
like
most
pilsner
style
lagers
has
some
sweetness
with
moderate
carbonation
it
has
some
mild
bitterness
but
nothing
like
an
ipa
overall
this
beer
is
not
for
the
appreciative
crowd
and
more
for
watching
football
eating
crawfish
or
something
to
play
beer
pong
with
this
was
americas
beer
before
its
lighter
brother
displaced
it
it
is
a
light
yellow
beer
with
a
yeasty
smell
with
hints
of
metal
the
taste
is
overall
of
its
principle
ingredient
rice
it
is
crisp
to
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
slightly
malty
overtone
as
the
aftertaste
see
my
review
for
bud
light
it
is
made
for
the
american
working
man
at
a
middle
pricing
range
great
commercials
but
poor
product
overall
his
lager
should
be
appreciated
for
what
it
is
a
clean
crisp
refreshing
brew
that
appeals
to
the
masses
and
can
be
drank
whenever
and
wherever
there
are
many
other
much
better
lagers
and
ales
that
appeal
to
those
of
us
with
discerning
tastes
and
appreciation
for
really
good
beer
but
after
a
day
of
construction
work
in
the
sweltering
summer
heat
nothing
beats
an
ice
cold
budweiser
just
as
during
the
shortest
and
coldest
of
days
in
winter
sitting
in
my
favorite
pub
a
pint
of
stout
porter
or
doppel
bock
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
drinkability
is
gonna
have
to
be
decent
here
if
i
were
forced
to
pick
a
macro
this
would
be
it
d
i
really
didnt
want
another
d
its
drinkable
but
there
is
a
lot
better
options
out
there
this
is
the
fit
in

just
wanted
to
add
that
i
was
very
surprised
at
how
unhorrible
the
king
of
beers
really
is
when
i
take
an
objective
look
at
it
budweiser
is
certainly

there
are

of

to
bring

back
that
ill

until
the
next

comes

rather
pay

5i
am
not
going
to
do
a
traditional
review
of
this
beer
has
great
marketing
and
an
almost
iconic
image
it
most
certainly
is
a
usurper
kingcrowingdec

nice
carbonation
a
pretty
drinkable
summer
beer
for
me
cnozzydec
21
but
among
the
big
three
i
can
think
of
plenty
of
other
beers
at
a
similar
pricepoint
that
are
equally
as
easy
to
drink
but
that
offer
so
much
more
this
beer
deserves
the
bad
rap
it
gets
around
here
overall
just
avoid
there
are
better
american
adjuncts
out
there
drinkability
is
that
oft
debated
term
meaning
different
things
to
different
people
i
say
that
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
while
being
far
from
goodtasting
i
dont
know
how
that
is
exactlyyou
figure
that
youd
have
to
truly
enjoy
something
to
drink
itbut
bud
has
so
little
character
it
is
an
easy
and
disgusting
swill
drinkability
personally
i
feel
this
style
is
one
that
has
poor
flavored
beers
and
this
one
may
be
a
bit
better
than
some
others
out
there
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
the
bottle
but
i
can
see
why
some
chug
this
light
flavored
beer
typical
american
adjunct
look
and
smell
pale
yellow
with
a
white
fizzy
head
lots
of
carbonation
smells
of
grains
and
metal
tastes
about
the
same
watered
down
grainy
taste
with
a
slight
metallic
finish
lots
of
carbonation
to
make
up
for
all
that
is
lacking
if
nothing
else
bud
diesels
are
drinkable
not
my
go
to
cheap
beer
by
any
means
though
pbr
holds
that
place
in
my
heart
budweiser
is
a
great
beer
for
what
it
is
definetly
not
for
beer
snobs
but
sometimes
i
think
people
bash
it
just
for
being
so
popular
and
because
it
comes
from
a
huge
corporation
so
what
sure
theres
a
time
and
place
for
a
good
pale
aledopplebock
ipa
or
stoutbut
there
are
times
i
really
crave
a
good
american
macro
open
your
mindspeople
overall
it
is
what
i
expected
it
to
be
i
consumed
this
beer
a
bit
warmer
than
suggested
which
did
not
help
the
drinkability
all
in
all
a
terrible
macro
thats
probably
not
worth
drinking
has
a
bad
combo
of
bad
taste
and
a
few
too
many
calories
ok
mouthfeel
drinkable
in
the
sense
it
is
balanced
thats
about
it
in
a
pinch
take
this
over
miller
alright
heres
the
disclaimer
before
getting
into
craft
beers
i
was
a
bud
drinker
i
havent
had
one
for
about
a
year
and
decided
to
buy
one
for
reviewing
purposes
i
know
its
popular
to
bash
the
bmcs
but
imo
budweiser
is
decent
for
a
lager
budweiser
american
lager
makes
a
thin
pinky
sized
head
that
vanishes
quickly
without
a
trace
there
is
very
little
lacing
and
this
beer
is
a
total
fail
there
are
no
fragrances
i
detect
and
the
taste
is
of
corn
and
booty
this
is
okay
for
mindless
partying
and
working
in
the
yard
but
yields
no
respect
at
my
dinner
table
one
of
my
first
beers
ever
and
thought
it
was
good
then
but
my
taste
buds
grew
up
and
now
i
will
only
drink
this
if
there
is
nothing
else
available
it
will
do
in
a
pinch
but
considering
how
tasteless
this
is
i
will
choose
a
craft
brew
any
day
over
this
o
not
the
king
of
beers
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
honestly
prefer
miller
lite
over
this
i
had
forgot
how
bad
this
beer
can
be
lowest
rating
ive
given
to
date
d
well
its
drinkable
but
so
is
water
this
beer
doesnt
offend
like
may
others
so
for
its
style
you
can
handle
it
like
most
people
on
this
website
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
goes
down
easily
and
although
watery
doesnt
kill
the
taste
buds
dif
i
could
stand
the
taste
and
smell
i
would
find
this
beer
highly
drinkable
its
the
closest
you
can
get
to
drinking
water
without
really
drinking
water
i
had
3
at
the
party
and
felt
full
from
all
the
cheap
filler
this
beer
has
in
it
i
wont
be
buying
this
but
if
its
offered
i
wont
turn
it
down
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
in
the
sense
of
the
ability
to
drink
massive
amounts
of
it
the
taste
is
incredibly
bland
and
thats
the
point
unfortunately
pours
a
bright
golden
yellow
with
bubbly
carbonation
frothy
white
head
minimal
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
standard
watery
light
adjunct
and
light
grain
wih
hints
of
sulfur
taste
follows
smell
with
a
watery
blend
of
adjuncts
grain
and
a
minor
sulfury
taste
light
bodied
thin
and
watery
over
carbonated
its
drinkable
yes
because
it
only
has
a
minimal
amount
of
of
tastes
smell
is
a
little
malty
and
crisp
taste
is
completely
unremarkable

in

with
this
beer
drinkability
is
king
easy
to
put
away
many
doctorstrangiatojul
31
and
when
you
pour
it
right
down
teh
middle
the
head
retention
is
surprising
they
served
this
side
by
side
with
yuengling
lager
and
i
was
amazed
by
the
difference
bud
doesnt
have
any
corn
in
it
which
gives
yuengling
and
most
other
macros
their
typical
frathouse
stink
what
i
also
noticed
is
that
bud
uses
a
very
clean
tasting
yeast
that
leaves
no
hint
of
character
yuengling
on
the
other
hand
had
a
surprisingly
perceptible
spicy
bavarian
note
that
i
usually
get
from
a
traditional
bock
and
i
will
admit
i
only
managed
to
notice
in
the
bland
environment
of
a
budweiser
tasting
head
to
head
the
yuengling
actually
came
off
as
offensive
a
shrewd
tactic
on
abs
part
cleanliness
was
a
good
thing
for
what
i
expect
from
budweiser
though
amidst
the
subtelty
of
the
light
malt
and
rice
and
barely
perceptible
hops
a
flavorful
yeast
would
just
not
fit
in
if
you
view
budweiser
as
the
delicate
beer
that
it
is
the
result
is
actually
a
wellbalanced
refreshing
light
lager
i
wouldnt
pair
it
with
food
since
it
wouldnt
even
support
a
sauteed
white
fish
but
i
do
enjoy
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
thirst
quenching
is
the
chief
concern
it
is
what
it
is
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
of
grains
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
to
it
the
overall
taste
is
of
grain
and
an
ever
so
slightly
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
carbonation
and
dryer
than
most
american
adjuncts
the
drinkability
is
higher
than
most
in
this
class
you
could
have
a
couple
of
them
notes
can
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
only
if
served
icecold
im
not
a
big
fan
of
budweiser
but
i
must
say
that
i
tend
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
as
that
is
what
tends
to
be
offered
parties
had
some
most
recently
at
my
buddys
american
lager
challenge
beer
pong
tourney
and
must
say
that
the
beer
continues
to
not
impress
it
is
just
bad
i
guess
i
would
drink
it
if
water
wasnt
available
i
truly
dislike
that
this
is
what
90
of
the
world
thinks
is
true
beer
i
know
i
shouldnt
judge
this
beer
because
of
who
made
it
but
when
you
spend
that
much
money
of
pacs
to
keep
control
of
the
market
sorry
your
product
is
not
worthy
typicle
american
beer
not
that
impressed
good
beer
if
you
are
deinking
all
day
in
the
sun
or
at
an
outdoor
concert
other
than
that
let
the
frat
boys
keep
it
this
beer
is
not
awful
but
it
is
not
good
either
if
use
to
be
better
i
think
back
in
the
days
before
aluminum
cans
and
pull
up
tabs
but
times
change
and
so
have
some
folks
tastes
beer
is
fizzy
and
gives
a
good
head
and
that
is
about
the
only
good
quality
it
has
disgusting
just
horrible
i
would
never
drink
that
stuff
again
its
piss
colored
water
and
alcohol
smelled
of
adjuncts
and
other
nasty
stuff
tasted
all
wrong
i
never
want
to
go
near
this
ever
again
this
is
certainly
not
the
king
of
beers
that
would
be

thank
you
very
much
out
of
a
can
this
iconic
beer
was
a
straw
gold
color
with
lots
of
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
a
billowing
out
of
control
mass
though
the
retention
was
only
decent
as
a
layer
and
the
lacing
soso
the
aroma
was
stale
and
macrograin
dominated
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
the
flavors
were
similar
crisp
classic
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
rough
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
mediumhigh
as
it
warmed
up
the
macrograin
flavor
became
more
intrusive
and
took
a
lot
away
from
it
but
the
socalled
king
of
beers
does
still
have
a
place
in
the
world
of
quality
brew
when
served
ice
cold
cheers
drinkability
its
weak
but
it
tastes
pretty
bad
even
for
very
little
money
there
are
way
better
options
i
could
down
a
lot
of
these
i
drank
bud
for
the
first
time
in
the
early
80s
and
my
reaction
was
pretty
simply
if
this
is
what
beer
tastes
like
then
i
do
not
like
it
thank
god
for
imports
and
microbrews
which
introduced
me
to
real
beer
the
flavor
notes
are
bitter
and
rotten
and
that
is
about
the
best
i
can
say
for
it
the
aftertaste
is
simply
awful
with
no
redeeming
characteristics
other
than
poor
flavor
how
on
earth
anheiser
busch
sells
millions
of
gallons
of
this
garbage
every
year
is
beyond
me
it
aint
even
that
cheap
d
it
is
what
it
is
easily
drinkable
with
a
bland
flavor
not
something
i
will
be
picking
up
often
dont
spend
your
own
hard
earned
money
on
this
massmarketed
product
overall
overhyped
and
overpriced
when
compared
to
the
competiton
especially
miller
high
life
and
old
milwaukee
king
of
beers
maybe
but
probably
not
great
beer
to
throw
down
on
a
hot
day
though
drinkability
refreshing
and
easy
to
slam
but
would
rather
have
so
many
other
beers
the
label
states
its
made
with
hops
rice
and
barley
malt
so
i
guess
the
rice
takes
over
as
there
is
only
a
hint
of
malt
in
each
sip
its
dull
to
me
and
feels
like
drinking
a
watered
down
beer
after
indulging
in
ipas
stouts
and
belgians
for
the
past
few
years
too
bland
for
my
liking
although
the
masses
enjoy
it
lively
carbonation
attacks
my
tongue
appropriately
thin
bodied
d
these
i
could
slug
back
wholesale
it
is
my
favorite
drunken
softball
playing
drink
ill
take
one
in
the
absence
of
any
real
beer
d
great
beer
for
sporting
events
meals
or
other
times
for
general
enjoyment
definitely
a
classic
drinkability
it
would
be
pretty
good
with
food
but
it
is
nothing
fantastic
its
not
a
chore
to
drink
but
not
one
id
recommend
either
moderately
refreshing
drinkable
due
to
its
lack
of
flavour
and
clean
crisp
palate
rr
taste
starts
as
moderately
unimpressive
and
contrives
to
go
rapidly
downhill
from
there
front
palate
is
watery
and
weak
with
slight
minimal
hoppy
undertones
then
overtaken
by
a
bitter
chemical
flavour
quite
insipid
and
metallic
finish
is
dreadful
with
a
cloying
bread
yeast
character
killing
off
any
drinkability
this
beer
may
have
gained
from
being
otherwise
so
flavourless
just
tastes
like
so
many
other
adjunct
lagers
and
with
a
very
poor
profile
to
make
it
stand
out
as
a
particularly
offensive
one
mouthfeel
so
thin
its
like
licking
the
inside
of
a
vacuum
tube
none
of
the
bubbles
promised
on
the
pour
a
distasteful
drop
this
weak
and
unpleasant
but
then
i
must
be
mistaken
how
could
a
million
rednecks
worldwide
be
wrong
had
on
tap
after
a
rolling
rock
smells
faintly
of
some
grains
and
maybe
a
bit
of
corn
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
no
real
head
tastes
fairly
clean
with
some
grainy
sweetness
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
theres
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
too
bad
on
tap
ive
always
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
but
there
are
cheaper
alternatives
if
this
is
what
you
were
going
for
the
verdict
looks
like
beer
smells
like
beer
and
tastes
like
beer
cheers
d
what
more
can
you
say
about
plain
old
budweiser
boring
lame
fall
back
cheap
beer
my
uncles
and
my
grandpa
drink
this
stuff
i
am
not
a
fan
by
any
means
but
i
will
not
turn
down
an
ice
cold
budweiser
from
a
bottle
or
a
can
i
guess
its
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
all
in
all
very
drinkable
it
doesnt
have
the
sour
aftertaste
of
other
macro
lagers
which
leave
a
sick
feeling
in
my
stomach
its
very
balanced
and
a
thirstquencher
in
that
regard
it
is
the
quintessential
brew
of
its
style
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
there
is
first
beer
i
ever
drank
as
a
an
underage
drinker
so
it
has
a
special
place
for
me
not
great
but
not
horrible
the
one
beer
that
is
served
at
every
ballpark
and
stadium
in
america
so
just
accept
it
when
consumed
ice
cold
flavors
and
aroma
matter
little
and
thats
the
way
this
beer
needs
to
be
consumed
ya
d
you
could
drink
this
but
the
question
is
why
would
you
with
so
many
options
that
are
better
this
beer
poured
a
light
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
only
lasted
second
and
a
lot
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
slight
malt
and
some
grain
the
taste
is
real
simple
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
then
a
crisp
finish
thats
about
it
im
not
sure
what
the
hell
happened
to
the
choicest
hops
that
they
talk
about
on
the
outside
of
the
40oz
but
im
not
tasting
them
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
has
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
crisp
as
a
good
macrobrew
should
this
is
indeed
drinkable
and
nothing
can
take
that
away
from
it
the
undisputed
king
of
mediocrity
in
beers
by
the
way
i
hope
the
label
of
budweiser
being
a
hick
beer
subsides
in
the
near
future
its
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
especially
since
no
other
lager
goes
through
the
same
process
as
this
one
does
to
my
knowledge
anyway
d
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
turns
out
bud
needs
10
years
sometimes
you
just
dont
want
something
too
complicated
and
budweiser
fits
the
bill
perfect
drinkability
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
i
got
what
i
paid
for
i
really
dont
think
this
is
a
horrible
beer
ive
had
much
worse
d
when
i
set
out
to
review
this
i
was
all
set
to
sample
it
with
an
open
mind
and
take
all
the
bas
to
task
for
unfairly
dumping
on
it
because
of
its
popularity
and
accessibility
but
after
seriously
examining
it
i
can
unequivocally
say
that
it
really
is
that
bad
if
i
were
judging
a
bjcp
competition
and
this
were
an
entry
in
the
standard
american
lager
category
id
give
it
a
gold
medal
but
that
only
makes
it
the
tallest
pygmy
if
youre
too
old
for
beer
pong
stay
far
away
if
this
beer
is
the
king
of
beers
then

and
i
enjoy
it

i
said
earlier
its
my
favorite
of
the
macros
and
really
it
isnt
all
that
bad
not
as
much
flavor
as
many
others
but
for
appealing
to
the
masses
and
trying
to
be
a

it

who
knew
that

could
be
so
good
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
only
in
the
way
you
can
chug
a
glass
of
water
id
rather
a
beer
that
i
want
to
drink
a
little
slowly
to
savor
the
flavors
this
i
just
want
to
swill
so
i
can
get
it
over
with
not
much
smell
not
a
bad
taste
but
not
great
i
understand
it
is
a
top
seller
but
that
is
mostly
due
to
people
drinking
in
bars
just
to
get
drunk
great
for
that
but
not
so
great
as
a
beer
to
relax
with
if
only
bud
could
put
a
decent
beer
in
this
cool
bottle
this
beer
is
not
terrible
poured
into
a
small
lager
glass
the
head
is
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
color
is
a
bright
straw
golden
hue
tight
carbonation
and
crystal
clear
the
aroma
is
a
cooked
corn
flake
and
pale
malt
grain
there
is
a
crisp
upfront
taste
but
a
sweet
aftertaste
that
lingers
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
there
is
a
slickness
that
is
unpleasant
that
coats
your
palate
and
keeps
that
aftertaste
from
leaving
i
drink
it
when
there
is
nothing
else
but
if
i
can
i
will
drink
something
else
the
mouthfeel
was
fizzy
and
lively
probably
the
beers
best
feature
certainly
drinkable
goes
down
pretty
easily
again
like
seltzer
would
certainly
refresh
on
a
hot
day
and
does
a
good
job
trying
to
be
exactly
what
it
is
a
massproduced
massmarketed
beer
product
thats
uberconsistent
doesnt
make
it
a
good
beer
frankly
i
dont
see
the
point
of
having
one
of
these
for
a
couple
of
extra
bucks
there
are
lots
of
better
choices
that
are
just
as
drinkable
and
refreshing
that
wont
bust
your
budget
to
any
huge
extent
but
it
is
what
it
is
pours
a
clear
color
with
a
decent
head
at
least
aroma
is
one
of
corn
and
malt
which
is
to
be
expected
of
the
style
taste
is
much
of
the
same
except
that
its
a
little
sour
and
leaves
an
interesting
aftertaste
of
corn
and
malt
nothing
impressive
for
sure
but
not
too
bad
for
the
style
a
little
sweet
and
syrupy
as
well
d
this
beer
is
a
classic
hands
down
it
is
cost
effective
it
is
smooth
easy
to
drink
refreshing
consistant
and
everything
it
was
meant
to
be
though
craft
beers
and
micro
brews
may
rise
above
in
taste
and
aroma
ab
did
exactly
what
it
set
out
to
do
create
a
beer
for
the
masses
that
will
retain
its
american
popularity
forever
and
ever
and
ever
d
if
the
price
was
right
and
i
was
hard
up
for
money
i
still
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
this
beer
every
once
in
a
while
i
will
buy
a
ab
product
and
its
always
disapoints
me
perhaps
a
bottle
would
taste
better
well
budweiser
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
after
my
long
haitus
from
the
beverage
selfimposed
while
i
tried
every
craft
beer
i
could
find
the
appearance
was
clear
light
orangeyellow
with
a
finely
composed
thin
white
foam
the
smell
was
light
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
and
maybe
hops
but
so
neutral
it
was
hard
to
tell
maybe
most
important
there
were
no
negative
aromas
to
speak
of
the
flavor
was
a
light
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
backend
again
not
negative
in
any
way
just
tailored
for
the
masses
not
bad
for
a
baseball
game
and
a
damn
sight
better
than
miller
lite
if
these
2
are
all
the
selection
you
have
as
is
commonly
the
case
this
offering
from
the
king
of
beers
pours
out
a
pale
straw
color
leaving
a
thin
white
lace
the
aroma
is
really
faint
which
is
what
ab
is
going
for
grain
maybe
some
very
suttle
hops
and
malt
the
taste
is
clean
crisp
refreshing
nothing
really
exciting
to
the
palate
though
again
a
quality
ab
is
going
for
the
beer
does
its
job
refreshing
clean
solid
macro
lager
for
the
style
i
give
it
a
perfect
score
but
for
my
overall
enjoyment
it
is
what
it
is
macro
lagers
are
to
beer
as
fast
food
is
to
fine
dining
i
might
suppose
budweiser
then
is
the
macdonalds
although
unlike
eating
at
the
golden
arches
i
cant
say
i
find
even
any
guilty
pleasure
in
drinking
this
still
as
a
macro
lager
it
is
just
fine
drinkability
what
can
i
say
other
than
it
is
budweiser
its
not
amazing
but
its
not
horrible
if
i
was
at
a
party
and
this
is
what
they
had
sure
id
drink
it
not
too
bad
ice
cold
and
during
the
hot
summer
months
on
tap
fresh
from
the
source
after
the
tour
poured
into
a
sample
glass
like
a
typical
macro
clear
pale
yellow
foamy
white
head
not
much
retention
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
and
grassy
taste
is
also
fruity
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
as
advertised
it
is
what
it
is
and
can
be
a
refreshing
beer
and
as
far
as
the
category
it
is
towards
the
top
for
me
i
wasted
my
dollar
and
will
avoid
in
the
future
i
have
had
two
versions
of
this
beer
the
anheuserbusch
brewed
version
in
the
bars
of
memphis
tennessee
and
the
brewed
in
canada
by
labatt
under
license
ill
take
the
canadian
version
hands
down
sadly
the
canadian
version
sucks
too
for
a
beer
that
is
as
heavily
advertised
as
it
is
and
sells
as
much
as
it
does
the
rating
here
says
it
all
this
is
americas
finest
pisswater
labatt
blue
is
canadas
finest
pisswater
it
amazes
me
when
i
go
out
with
friends
there
is
always
one
who
orders
bud
take
a
gamble
people
try
one
of
the
beers
on
tap
youve
never
heard
of
theyre
great
with
all
due
respect
to
tony
the
tiger
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
avoid
having
it
in
your
fridge
is
a
great
way
to
get
taken
off
my
christmas
card
list
d
the
only
reason
this
gets
an
extra
5
is
because
you
theoretically
could
drink
12
of
these
personally
id
rather
drink
4
of
something
that
actually
has
some
character
though
16
oz
can
left
over
from
an
afterwork
cookout
born
on
date
25may07
looks
like
the
urine
sample
i
submitted
for
my
last
drug
test
only
fizzier
very
weak
sweet
malt
aroma
very
weak
sweet
malt
flavor
very
weak
watery
mouthfeel
budweiser
is
the
beer
equivalent
of
carbon
monoxide
colorless
odorless
tastelss
lethal
in
large
doses
i
only
give
it
a
4
on
drinkability
because
you
can
chug
it
like
theres
no
tomorrow
the
appearance
is
pale
yellow
like
a
discharge
we
know
the
taste
is
thin
because
they
use
very
little
malt
and
use
rice
syrups
to
boost
the
alcohol
strohs
is
not
really
good
but
its
way
better
than
bud
bud
has
an
eerie
similarity
among
all
its
breweries
quality
control
or
what
only
drink
if
you
have
to
compliment
the
host
ill
always
like
this
beer
for
what
it
is
dont
be
too
harsh
on
the
king
hes
got
the
crown
for
some
damn
reason
oh
and
after
several
of
these
ice
cold
who
the
hell
really
cares
what
youre
drinkin
anyway
right
take
care
and
happy
sippin
my
beerlovin
friends
ciao
for
now
this
buds
for
you
than
the
contents
so
do
recycle
clear
and
golden
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
thin
white
head
smell
is
mainly
of
malts
somewhat
grainy
the
smallest
hint
of
hops
is
present
as
well
taste
is
of
sweet
somewhat
tart
malts
more
flavor
than
other
macro
lagers
mouthfeel
seems
light
as
it
should
be
though
too
much
carbonation
isnt
its
best
match
drinkability
is
close
to
good
as
it
is
extremely
light
and
admittedly
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
yep
there
are
plenty
of
other
beers
id
like
to
drink
but
this
is
probably
near
the
top
among
macro
lagers
ive
enjoyed
this
24
ouncer
and
have
decided
further
investigation
is
in
order
overall
watery
bland
characterless
and
no
personality
light
mouthfeel
with
some
slight
grainyness
would
be
a
bit
more
drinkable
if
not
for
the
strange
aftertaste
best
when
cold
and
very
thirsty
not
a
beer
i
would
keep
in
my
fridge
pale
straw
yellow
with
some
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
metallic
highly
highly
metallic
dig
deeper
and
you
find
some
maltyness
dig
deeper
if
you
dare
anyway
taste
is
also
metallic
very
light
and
barely
malty
mouthfeel
has
a
bit
more
to
it
overall
this
is
what
it
is
a
bud
many
drink
it
because
its
light
and
goes
great
with
food
at
a
bbq
and
its
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
cant
blame
them
but
id
still
rather
have
a
pbr
or
something
else
similar
cheaper
and
tastes
better
the
more
i
learn
about
how
beer
is
made
the
more
i
can
appreciate
beers
like
this
10
years
ago
i
would
have
scoffed
cheers
it
is
what
it
is
budweiser
i
tried
three
new
single
bottles
tonight
harp
bass
and
peroni
reverting
back
to
this
crap
is
the
worst
like
i
said
its
a
budweiser
a
watery
piss
colored
standard
domestic
redneck
beer
thumbs
down
for
this
bottle
of
pee
water
note
somehow
on
the
golf
course
this
beer
is
transformed
into
a
heavenly
thirstquenching
brew
thats
miraculously
worth
the
3
for
a
can
seriously
something
about
the
outdoors
and
maybe
not
ice
ice
cold
brings
out
a
fullness
in
the
underdeveloped
fruit
nose
and
a
nice
sprightly
taste
i
read
somewhere
that
ab
uses
9
hops
for
this
one
at
least
a
few
of
those
show
up
in
the
right
setting
es
una
cerveza
gringa
sin
cuerpo
ni
sabor
ni
nada
de
las
peorcitas
que
he
probado
aunque
se
vende
mucho
y
tiene
muchisima
publicidad
y
tiene
la
exclusiva
de
los
mundiales
de
futbol
el
envase
es
ambar
con
etiqueta
de
papel
hay
ediciones
especiales
de
esta
cerveza
como
la
conmemorativa
al
mundial
lo
unico
que
cambia
es
la
etiqueta
i
drank
this
at
a
party
because
there
wasnt
anything
else
available
appearance
is
typical
of
an
american
macrobrew
lager
aroma
is
malty
and
better
than
i
expected
but
not
wonderful
taste
is
malty
and
rather
wan
though
it
is
zingy
and
jazzy
in
the
mouth
it
is
not
a
memorable
beer
well
i
had
to
try
it
after
drinking
craft
beers
for
so
long
id
call
this
one
a
little
underrated
almost
as
good
as
pbr
for
a
macro
the
color
is
a
little
to
dark
to
look
like
urine
as
some
people
like
to
say
th
taste
has
a
hint
all
the
flavors
are
hints
of
grains
with
a
slight
tang
the
drinkability
is
decent
and
the
overall
experience
isnt
offensive
still
this
beer
is
one
id
only
drink
if
given
or
free
beef
notes
i
needed
something
to
drink
with
my
pizza
and
this
did
the
job
not
nearly
as
bad
as
bud
light
and
actually
quite
serviceable
in
a
pinch
dont
be
afraid
to
crack
one
open
if
theres
nothing
better
next
please
please
this
beer
being
a
macro
lager
still
is
a
very
good
beeris
nothing
to
be
impress
aboutthis
beer
have
a
light
gold
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
hard
taste
or
a
hard
feeling
on
the
mouth
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
smell
good
beer
if
you
want
to
have
more
than
one
da
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
bottle
but
it
was
slightly
better
than
the
canned
version
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
pure
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
light
hops
corn
and
water
tastes
average
really
nothing
good
about
it
but
nothing
bad
better
than
most
american
macro
brewed
lagers
especially
the
light
ones
i
think
it
gets
a
bad
rap
but
it
isnt
that
undrinkable
mouthfell
does
leave
something
yearning
years
ago
i
thought
this
was
the
greatest
beer
on
the
market
however
i
grew
up
and
tried
other
kinds
of
beers
and
my
opinion
of
budweiser
has
changed
immensely
it
had
been
a
while
since
i
tried
budweiser
so
i
picked
up
a
12
pack
that
was
on
sale
the
other
day
what
a
waste
of
money
i
dont
know
what
i
ever
saw
in
this
swill
it
has
to
be
ice
cold
in
order
for
me
to
drink
it
its
actually
not
too
bad
ice
cold
but
once
it
warms
a
little
forget
it
drinkability
felt
like
i
was
wasting
my
time
hurried
the
beer
so
i
could
go
on
to
the
next
drink
im
in
college
so
we
drink
this
stuff
alot
much
to
my
dismay
its
your
stereotypical
macro
beer
doesnt
smell
very
good
doesnt
look
very
good
but
you
can
pound
them
very
easily
cheap
beer
means
you
can
share
them
when
your
on
the
college
budget
like
myself
but
if
you
want
to
buy
some
cheap
beer
you
might
as
well
by
keystone
light
or
somethin
10
bucks
a
30
pack
haha
cause
when
you
start
drinking
beers
that
are
this
dull
they
all
start
to
taste
the
same
even
before
i
knew
anything
about
good
beer
and
drank
mgd
and
little
kings
all
the
time
i
hated
bud
i
hated
how
flavorless
and
watery
it
was
even
back
then
even
compared
to
other
macros
super
light
in
color
and
of
course
overly
carbonated
necessary
to
balance
since
there
is
no
hop
character
faint
vegetal
and
metallic
aromas
no
flavor
to
speak
of
completely
absent
of
malt
or
hop
flavor
other
than
some
rice
adjuncts
detected
finishes
very
crisp
due
to
the
super
light
body
and
aforementioned
carbonation
this
is
a
minor
step
up
from
bud
light
and
why
would
anyone
drink
this
when
clean
drinking
water
is
readily
available
oh
yeah
gullible
ignorant
tough
guys
love
this
insipid
crap
along
with
our
media
saturated
youth
highly
drinkable
not
filling
i
can
suck
quite
a
few
of
these
down
classic
all
american
macro
beer
drinkability
funky
smell
a
nice
malty
sweetness
in
the
finish
bad
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
though
the
king
of
beers
eh
not
sure
what
type
of
kingdom
this
king
would
preside
over
appearance
is
inviting
to
say
the
least
what
with
how
weve
been
inundated
over
the
years
with
the
sight
of
this
beer
really
light
almost
neon
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
wilts
after
the
first
few
sips
smell
nothing
to
report
a
dry
sharp
acidity
in
the
smell
is
noticeable
tastes
like
carbonated
water
with
just
a
tart
tinge
of
hops
weak
mouthfeel
none
to
report
this
is
a
light
lager
which
could
easily
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
if
youre
mowing
the
lawn
and
want
something
cold
i
might
pick
this
over
water
as
it
does
have
alcohol
also
its
a
beer
ill
go
for
if
all
the
other
offerings
are
bud
light
coors
light
etc
d
its
light
smooth
but
im
still
not
fond
of
the
taste
even
if
it
is
light
as
well
pale
in
color
with
decent
head
and
an
awful
smell
you
could
drink
these
all
day
long
but
why
would
you
want
to
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
are
in
high
school
and
havent
experiend
real
beer
but
other
than
that
its
an
extremely
dissapointing
beer
in
flavor
and
smell
this
beer
is
so
poor
that
it
almost
turned
me
off
to
domestic
beers
altogether
until
i
found
rouge
and
highland
drinkability
is
pretty
fine
as
long
as
its
not
on
tap
you
should
have
no
problem
drinking
the
real
budweizer
all
night
a
fine
hess
beer
nothing
gourmet
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
paint
thinner
either
this
ones
as
low
as
i
go
and
thats
not
a
put
down
decent
average
stuff
overall
if
you
are
mowing
your
lawn
and
have
this
beer
ice
cold
it
might
do
the
trick
other
than
that
no
other
redeeming
qualities
under
no
circumstances
have
this
at
anything
above
freezing
temperature
i
let
mine
warm
slightly
and
it
got
unpleasant
very
quickly
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
but
served
very
very
cold
it
can
be
rather
refreshing
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
its
just
simply
not
very
good
and
i
dont
really
want
to
drink
anymore
overall
drinking
budweiser
is
a
nice
nostalgic
trip
down
memory
lane
other
than
that
i
certainly
wouldnt
recommend
it
bud
has
always
been
a
drinkable
beer
white
thick
head
from
tap
light
fizzy
head
from
bottle
not
impressed
with
the
taste
never
have
been
its
a
lot
like
s
strong
club
soda
not
the
worst
beer
far
from
the
best
looks
better
than
it
tastes
bottom
line
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
easy
to
drink
would
be
better
with
less
carbonation
or
more
flavor
ahh
the
king
of
beers
everyone
needs
a
bud
right
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
huge
white
head
that
just
sank
into
the
glass
after
a
few
seconds
lots
of
visible
carbonation
left
this
at
least
looking
halfway
decent
smell
was
light
but
what
was
there
was
of
rice
and
grain
slightly
musty
at
least
it
had
a
smell
albeit
muted
the
taste
was
very
bland
almost
like
wet
paper
born
on
date
said
it
was
fine
but
just
did
not
taste
well
at
all
very
carbonated
and
light
which
seems
to
be
the
case
with
most
of
these
macros
when
they
are
ice
cold
they
go
down
like
water
when
they
warm
its
just
a
mess
can
really
not
see
myself
drinking
this
again
anytime
soon
if
ever
at
all
this
poured
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
head
and
light
glass
retention
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
all
what
you
would
expect
as
this
is
the
goldstandard
of
american
macros
everything
average
with
nothing
remotely
complex
or
inventive
but
completely
runofthemill
its
amusing
to
me
that
most
of
my
friends
that
drink
macros
by
the
gallon
hate
this
stuff
but
those
of
us
that
enjoy
our
beers
from
the
crafted
variety
will
doent
always
despise
this
if
we
are
forced
to
choose
a
macro
hey
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
no
beer
at
all
simply
not
a
good
beer
looks
like
hell
light
and
fairly
complex
taste
but
most
the
nuances
are
unpleasant
refreshing
yes
hydrating
yes
but
i
would
rather
just
drink
tap
water
although
you
cant
argue
with
the
price
you
get
what
you
pay
for
stick
to
this
beer
on
draft
this
beer
gets
worse
light
golden
color
weak
smell
and
very
weak
flavor
it
felt
very
carbonated
but
because
of
its
weak
taste
it
was
very
drinkable
almost
like
water
compared
to
other
beers
d
there
is
no
point
in
drinking
this
beer
it
has
no
taste
poured
a
clear
straw
color
not
quite
corona
yellow
had
a
small
soapy
white
head
the
dissipated
into
nothingness
not
much
of
a
smell
maybe
a
bit
of
adjuncts
the
taste
is
quite
neutral
and
when
i
say
neutral
i
mean
dont
taste
like
nothing
it
has
just
enough
malt
taste
in
it
to
offset
the
adjunct
taste
not
like
bud
light
i
think
i
may
have
detected
a
hop
it
has
a
pretty
fizzy
watery
mouthfeel
that
finishes
like
seltzer
water
fine
cooler
beer
for
tailgating
and
mass
consumption
its
kind
of
worth
a
try
but
it
is
an
american
macro
notes
a
good
session
beer
but
nothing
more
overall
another
hohum
macro
lager
why
bother
its
not
the
worst
macro
lager
but
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
on
my
own
initiative
and
wouldnt
drink
it
unless
there
was
a
very
good
reason
its
very
bland
and
inoffensive
made
to
appeal
to
every
beer
drinker
in
the
world
not
trying
to
slam
the
beer
without
reason
its
just
gross
its
not
the
style
im
more
than
happy
to
have
a
high
life
or
a
pbr
in
front
of
me
just
about
any
time
this
is
undrinkable
a
slightly
distinguishable
brew
with
that
beechnut
corn
sweetness
but
for
a
couple
bucks
more
get
brooklyn
lager
or
dortmunder
gold
and
call
it
a
day
no
i
didnt
pour
it
down
the
drain
it
isnt
that
bad
i
finished
the
pint
but
it
truly
is
not
very
good
beer
american
macro
designed
to
be
as
inoffensive
as
possible
to
the
largest
number
of
people
drinkability
its
very
drinkable
when
ice
cold
but
as
it
warms
up
and
you
can
actually
taste
and
smell
it
well
it
aint
real
pleasant
anyways
here
goes
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
light
yellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
lacing
was
non
existant
except
about
an
inch
at
the
end
of
the
drink
smells
like
funky
water
i
dont
know
what
to
relate
the
taste
to
but
boring
watery
swill
mouthfeel
isnt
anything
to
declare
but
nothing
to
really
knock
either
i
can
drink
this
all
day
if
i
were
to
have
a
party
with
a
bunch
of
jocks
and
bros
this
would
probably
satisfy
them
quite
well
budweiser
everyone
knows
it
many
hate
it
many
love
it
some
dont
give
a
rats
ass
about
it
like
me
pours
a
very
weak
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
fuzziness
smells
like
water
tastes
sweet
slightly
malty
and
very
watery
mouthfeel
like
carbonated
water
overall
its
quite
drinkable
but
who
really
cares
budweiser
pride
themselves
in
only
using
the
best
ingredients
but
why
this
is
a
nothing
beer
for
tasteless
folk
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
watery
thin
and
borders
on
light
body
the
carbonation
is
probably
the
most
annoying
thing
about
this
beer
i
found
the
carbonation
to
be
stinging
this
beer
wasnt
the
chore
i
thought
it
would
be
to
drink
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
it
is
far
from
the
king
of
beers
this
beer
has
no
real
smells
or
taste
to
it
the
body
of
the
beer
really
doesnt
have
anything
to
reccomend
it
if
this
was
my
only
choice
i
think
i
would
do
without
a
beer
d
this
beer
is
very
light
and
clean
with
no
malt
taste
and
a
faint
hint
of
hops
but
it
is
not
a
bitterness
the
biggest
part
of
this
beer
is
the
bubbles
im
impressed
that
they
can
high
the
alcohol
in
a
beer
this
light
but
dont
forget
that
drinking
too
much
of
this
alcoholic
yellow
water
will
lead
to
very
bad
things
the
next
day
why
do
macros
do
such
evil
things
to
a
persons
digestive
system
not
that
good
but
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
tastes
sweet
though
not
sure
what
from
smells
slightly
sweet
crisp
and
clean
quite
drinkable
light
bodied
but
not
as
light
as
i
was
expecting
wish
i
had
more
to
say
but
this
beer
just
didnt
strike
me
okay
for
what
it
is
there
are
definitely
worse
macros
out
there
this
mass
produced
lager
poours
a
pale
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
disapated
quickly
a
bit
of
thin
lacing
and
a
crown
which
fades
fast
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
too
the
smell
is
rather
metallic
with
definite
rice
and
malts
the
taste
is
a
bland
with
a
bit
of
a
harsh
hoppy
aftertaste
which
i
found
frankly
nasty
its
crisping
and
watery
with
very
little
body
its
fairly
refreshing
maybe
after
a
number
of
pints
of
the
good
stuff
but
clearly
not
something
i
would
drink
i
merely
tried
it
because
i
had
the
opportunity
to
review
it
but
so
is
water
d
low
abv
and
relative
lack
of
taste
make
this
a
session
beer
that
appeals
to
millions
of
people
i
must
admit
it
does
go
down
easy
its
also
pretty
tasty
at
a
cookout
however
there
are
much
better
alternatives
within
the
macro
lager
category
finished
crisp
and
clean
since
it
really
didnt
get
warm
in
the
cup
with
the
freezing
weather
only
really
drinkable
if
you
keep
it
ice
cold
must
be
the
beach
wood
aging
drinkability
even
though
i
hate
this
beer
something
was
done
right
cause
it
is
one
of
the
biggest
selling
beer
in
the
world
so
for
drinkability
the
statistics
say
yes
while
i
say
no
this
beer
has
no
tastefull
malt
no
presence
of
hops
of
any
kind
has
a
nasty
after
taste
is
watery
and
lifeless
the
only
thing
that
is
respectfull
about
this
beer
is
its
filtering
and
the
fact
that
ab
sat
down
and
came
up
with
a
recipe
that
try
to
offend
the
least
amount
of
people
to
make
it
the
1
most
bought
beer
in
the
world
its
still
awful
drinkability
is
the
best
part
of
a
budweiser
no
offensive
tastes
clean
finish
cant
really
complain
when
it
comes
down
to
realizing
that
this
is
a
macrolager
looks
like
your
typical
american
macro
smells
like
it
taste
is
better
than
it
looks
or
smells
but
i
wont
flatter
mouth
is
bubbles
and
water
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
will
have
it
if
its
the
last
thing
available
chances
are
if
you
are
drinking
this
and
posting
a
review
your
buddy
gave
you
this
and
it
was
your
only
choice
i
really
tried
to
be
objective
and
review
solely
on
what
was
in
the
glass
not
what
was
on
the
label
in
all
honesty
the
only
thing
that
even
remotely
reminded
me
of
beer
was
the
color
and
modest
head
there
was
a
vague
recollection
of
hops
in
the
aroma
almost
as
if
this
beer
had
talked
to
a
hop
plant
in
some
dark
forgotten
history
beyond
the
appearance
of
a
classic
pilsner
any
trace
of
the
genes
of
the
true
lagers
from
europe
is
long
since
been
bred
out
of
this
beer
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
made
me
think
of
a
jones
soda
that
is
beer
flavored
the
carbonation
in
this
beer
is
way
overdone
as
if
it
had
just
come
out
of
a
bottle
with
a
co2
canister
attached
this
beer
might
be
suitable
to
pour
into
a
large
pot
for
a
crab
boil
but
only
if
you
add
enough
other
seasonings
slainte
going
to
drink
a
st
bernardus
prior
8
in
an
attempt
to
free
my
abused
tastebuds
notes
i
admire
this
beer
for
its
clean
aroma
and
flavor
it
takes
some
brewing
skill
and
the
right
equipment
to
produce
something
as
clean
and
consistent
as
this
however
ive
always
found
the
flavor
of
budweiser
and
the
like
to
be
quite
objectionable
i
can
barely
finish
12
ounces
of
this
drinkability
very
cheap
good
beer
to
drink
if
you
just
want
to
get
buzzed
id
drink
this
beer
once
in
every
blue
moon
for
its
alcohol
and
thats
about
it
and
in
that
event
id
go
with
something
quite
a
bit
cheaper
like
schlitz
or
old
style
overall
it
is
what
it
is
an
american
macro
than
serves
its
purpose
but
isnt
exactly
a
beer
advocate
brew
budweiser
was
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
quickly
dissipated
to
a
very
thin
layer
and
eventually
became
just
a
thin
ring
the
aroma
was
very
light
with
a
little
grain
the
taste
was
light
as
well
crisp
and
clean
with
a
dry
finish
it
did
not
taste
bad
but
there
is
just
not
much
there
to
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
highly
carbonated
drinkability
was
about
average
much
better
than
a
light
beer
overall
i
would
not
recommend
budweiser
to
anyone
that
actually
likes
beer
overall
taste
and
drinkability
are
passabe
but
not
to
my
liking
if
its
the
only
thing
available
ill
drink
it
but
most
times
ill
take
a
pass
i
realize
that
this
beer
outsells
anything
in
the
u
s
hands
down
but
ive
never
been
much
of
an
ab
fan
even
long
before
i
gained
an
appreciation
for
craft
beer
i
like
the
fact
that
it
is
american
owned
but
megacorporations
like
ab
and
wal
mart
are
just
bad
in
general
i
digress
a
standard
yellow
low
carbonated
american
lager
appearance
s
a
little
hoppier
than
many
american
macros
with
a
definite
corn
aroma
with
something
that
i
would
characterize
as
beechwood
t
pretty
smooth
mild
with
a
nice
clean
finish
really
not
too
bad
m
clean
and
crisp
nice
carbonation
balance
d
in
the
past
if
bud
approached
warmer
temps
i
would
pitch
it
but
this
session
it
actually
seemed
to
improve
when
not
ice
cold
i
was
surprised
to
say
the
least
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
it
still
pains
me
to
patronize
ab
but
if
i
find
myself
in
a
pinch
for
selectionmom
and
pop
markets
at
the
lake
are
a
prime
example
i
will
now
consider
something
that
i
previously
would
not
have
mouthfeeldrinkability
to
its
credit
the
carbonation
is
restrained
just
to
the
right
degree
there
is
much
action
and
life
but
it
doesnt
wreck
the
inside
of
the
mouth
soft
yet
busy
the
watery
finish
is
a
letdown
and
it
emphasizes
the
adjuncts
in
a
negative
way
not
a
good
beer
for
waxing
poetic
over
just
another
massproduced
american
macro
offering
for
the
majority
who
will
settle
fizzy
yellow
beer
the
only
thing
going
for
it
is
its
availability
and
drinkability
same
everytime
everywhere
whatever
serving
everybar
including
some
of
the
best
beer
bars
carry
this
or
bud
light
i
dont
recommend
it
but
it
is
what
it
is
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
its
not
too
bad
lookingbut
the
color
is
too
light
the
smell
is
were
the
big
macros
really
go
belly
up
there
is
almost
no
smell
at
all
in
thismaybe
a
small
scent
of
corn
or
sweet
maltbut
thats
it
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
with
sweet
malt
corn
and
floral
flavors
the
mf
is
light
and
what
little
flavors
there
are
mix
well
bud
is
very
drinkable
you
can
say
what
you
wantbut
it
goes
down
easywhen
cold
its
everywhere
and
you
can
drink
alot
of
it
budweiser
is
what
it
is
a
large
macro
that
appeals
to
the
masses
its
not
greatbut
it
has
its
place
in
the
beer
kingdom
im
quite
surprised
at
the
number
of
3
reviews
for
this
beer
notes
d
this
may
be
a
very
light
beer
and
extremely
light
on
flavor
but
in
no
way
does
it
taste
bad
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
i
am
not
ashamed
in
any
way
to
drink
them
from
time
to
time
its
drinkable
but
far
from
great
while
the
drinkability
is
very
high
the
thinness
of
the
brew
is
its
final
downfall
get
my
buzz
onno
d
i
prefer
this
to
the
light
no
frills
here
as
it
has
to
sacrifice
almost
all
character
to
appeal
to
the
50
of
the
market
it
dominates
very
quenchable
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
probably
took
your
beercherry
ah
the
memories
overall
not
a
good
lager
by
any
stretch
not
easy
to
drink
with
no
redeeming
qualities
im
no
ab
or
macro
lager
hater
if
this
was
a
good
beer
my
review
would
reflect
that
this
is
the
epitome
of
an
unimpressive
american
beer
that
said
this
is
also
the
least
bad
of
the
products
manufactured
by
the
big
3
if
im
somewhere
where
my
choices
are
limited
to
coors
miller
and
ab
products
and
the
ubiquitous
corona
and
i
simply
must
have
a
beer
ill
take
a
bud
i
doubt
i
need
to
explain
its
characteristics
to
anyone
22407
update
had
bud
in
a
tall
neck
with
recent
date
of
making
sorry
no
improvement
still
holding
out
for
draft
drinkability
up
there
with
the
best
how
can
anyone
honestly
say
otherwise
i
guess
considering
the
style
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
tiny
head
with
almost
no
retention
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
poured
from
a
can
into
a
mug
the
beer
smells
like
a
typical
macro
lager
and
very
weak
the
taste
is
also
typical
of
the
style
nothing
too
impressive
but
what
do
you
expect
definately
a
ricey
taste
to
it
very
crisp
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
typical
go
to
the
party
get
drunk
who
cares
about
the
taste
beer
if
thats
what
you
want
drink
it
well
actually
do
i
have
time
to
think
about
that
before
deciding
d
not
bad
a
generally
inoffensive
if
flavourless
beer
i
guess
this
is
what
macro
lagers
are
all
about
overall
not
too
bad
but
far
from
great
i
wouldnt
buy
it
this
one
is
very
drinkable
but
not
too
exciting
if
you
swapped
it
with
water
i
may
of
never
noticed
its
a
good
beer
when
there
are
no
other
options
and
you
just
want
to
get
drunk
if
you
want
something
good
to
drink
and
cant
find
another
type
of
beer
get
a
glass
of
water
its
cheaper
d
easy
to
drink
macro
beer
designed
to
be
drunk
in
large
quantities
not
a
bad
choice
among
american
macro
beers
i
could
drink
this
but
i
would
get
bored
by
the
time
i
finished
it
i
wouldnt
want
another
i
just
glad
i
dont
actually
buy
this
one
it
would
be
a
waste
of
my
money
the
drinkability
was
not
good
at
all
and
yea
thats
really
all
there
is
to
say
about
that
so
if
you
like
it
what
ever
but
its
not
my
first
choice
lets
put
it
that
way
as
a
beer
in
general
there
is
many
other
better
beers
out
there
but
for
a
macro
its
really
not
that
bad
budweiser
is
a
great
selling
product
due
to
the
relentless
advertising
that
appears
everywhere
you
turn
it
has
wide
availability
and
it
will
likely
continue
to
sell
in
spite
of
its
many
flaws
i
drink
it
only
when
i
have
no
other
choice
otherwise
the
so
called
king
of
beers
is
not
permitted
to
dine
at
my
table
ill
take
a
lesser
known
microbrewed
beer
any
day
had
one
for
the
hell
of
it
awhile
back
poured
that
nasty
putrid
looking
american
macro
color
of
dehydrated
piss
head
was
all
big
bubbles
didnt
have
any
retention
albeit
better
than
its
light
counterpart
smell
is
really
nothing
a
bit
corny
but
not
as
strong
as
millers
offerings
the
taste
is
decent
kind
of
malty
and
primarily
adjuncty
however
the
mouthfeel
water
just
like
anything
else
produced
by
ab
drinkability
is
the
only
high
part
of
this
beer
if
your
looking
to
throw
a
party
or
whatever
and
dont
want
to
slip
below
natty
light
this
or
coors
original
is
what
you
wanna
go
with
usually
on
sale
in
some
sort
of
different
packing
for
the
love
of
god
i
dont
know
why
people
pick
this
up
in
the
22
oz
can
all
the
time
a
40
must
be
hell
this
beer
pours
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
light
lace
of
head
the
head
stuck
around
until
i
was
finished
it
had
a
faint
smell
of
sweet
grain
but
not
much
of
any
other
smell
it
tasted
fairly
common
place
with
a
grainy
malt
flavor
but
unlike
many
caned
beers
there
wasnt
much
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
it
has
a
bubbly
feel
and
a
smooth
texture
over
all
it
has
been
around
as
long
as
it
has
for
a
reason
its
a
finely
drinkable
beer
that
would
appeal
to
most
people
its
not
too
complex
but
it
has
a
decent
taste
ok
here
is
the
one
and
only
king
of
beers
well
i
dont
know
where
they
came
up
with
that
tag
line
this
doesnt
taste
like
it
should
carry
that
tag
line
poured
into
a
pint
glass
yellow
and
fizzy
with
a
head
that
recedes
in
less
than
5
seconds
no
lace
left
taste
is
of
malt
with
corn
added
to
it
not
very
tasty
i
like
to
avoid
this
loser
of
beers
at
all
costs
salud
it
sort
of
quenches
a
thirst
and
i
can
drink
it
when
only
american
macros
are
available
or
in
a
pinch
but
it
really
lacks
character
and
a
good
taste
drinkability
is
something
like
this
could
i
session
it
no
could
i
chug
it
at
a
frat
party
yep
drinkability
easy
drinker
just
kinda
boring
and
not
very
appealing
tastewise
its
kinda
the
beer
youd
drink
after
you
just
got
done
mowing
the
grass
also
id
say
its
better
in
the
canbottle
i
can
see
why
its
been
about
10
years
since
i
had
one
of
these
and
itll
probably
be
atleast
that
long
until
i
have
one
again
every
now
and
then
i
go
down
to
the
local
biker
bar
and
drink
a
couple
of
beers
all
the
bikers
down
there
drink
bud
because
it
makes
them
look
tough
if
your
a
biker
looking
tough
especialy
in
front
of
your
buddies
is
big
medicine
what
do
i
drink
when
i
go
down
there
bud
of
course
hell
im
in
a
biker
bar
anyhow
i
dont
know
that
i
have
ever
bought
this
beer
until
this
weekend
i
wanted
to
try
some
beers
that
are
mainstream
and
that
i
havent
had
before
i
picked
up
a
24
ounce
can
of
bud
and
got
exactly
what
i
paid
for
yellow
low
flavor
low
hops
consistently
brewed
macro
lager
being
a
hot
day
it
went
down
smooth
d
easy
drinking
as
they
say
in
the
ads
i
could
drink
20
of
these
at
a
baseball
game
anyday
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
little
carbonation
and
has
minimal
head
which
thins
out
to
pretty
much
a
single
layer
of
bubbles
with
a
little
more
on
the
side
looks
like
water
with
a
drop
off
yellow
food
coloring
has
a
sweetier
malty
smell
than
i
remember
and
has
a
faint
piney
hop
aroma
also
the
taste
is
much
stronger
than
i
remember
also
and
kinda
just
sits
in
your
mouth
but
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
in
this
case
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
acidity
and
kinda
burns
in
the
back
of
the
throat
the
beer
isnt
very
well
balanced
this
beer
could
be
a
bit
better
if
the
flavor
and
carbonation
were
balanced
a
little
better
md
rather
sharp
on
the
mouthfeel
and
extremely
thinbodied
leaving
an
artificial
feel
down
the
palate
although
at
least
it
doesnt
have
too
much
negative
bearing
from
the
cheap
adjuncts
like
sticky
or
chemical
now
i
know
why
its
not
liked
to
say
the
least
by
so
many
people
who
know
their
beers
its
definitely
the
blandest
beer
ive
ever
had
so
much
so
that
even
those
cheap
replicates
of
this
legend
taste
more
exciting
than
this
simply
boring
and
bland
not
worth
my
single
penny
on
it
i
probably
would
never
drink
this
again
big
head
that
does
not
retain
well
save
a
small
crown
pale
pale
yellow
straw
color
not
much
there
to
smell
the
faintest
grains
same
with
the
flavor
you
really
have
to
let
it
linger
to
get
any
flavor
the
mildest
of
hops
everything
that
survives
the
watery
base
is
overwhelmed
by
the
fizz
a
little
bready
malt
on
the
finish
is
the
only
thing
that
separates
it
from
the
lite

perhaps
slightly
fuller
mouthfeel
too
but
that
might
be
a
reach
to
its
credit
you
know
what
you
are
getting
and
it
always
tastes
the
same
its
also
incredibly
easy
to
drink
refreshing
even
with
the
little
chunks
of
ice
floating
in
it
it
was
very
quaffable
it
was
cold
and
refreshing
and
went
well
with
the
pizza
if
i
have
to
drink
macro
it
might
as
well
be
a
bud
drinkability
my
last
one
was
4
years
ago
d
decent
but
not
as
high
as
pbr
or
high
life
ill
stick
with
them
in
the
future
when
free
squid
isnt
a
factor
drinkability
this
beer
is
chock
full
of
impurities
and
preservatives
that
give
me
a
massive
headache
i
would
reach
for
a
pbr
or
molson
before
i
reached
for
a
bud
ultimately
a
clean
refreshing
american
lager
that
defines
the
style
well
promotes
itself
to
ready
drinkability
quite
well
without
being
too
watery
and
with
no
other
clearly
discernible
faults
i
pray
to
god
i
never
drink
this
again
hmmm
were
to
begin
why
would
some
one
drink
a
bud
well
lets
just
say
it
was
there
and
leave
it
at
that
pours
a
clear
light
gold
color
there
was
a
nice
fizzy
head
i
wont
say
foamy
as
while
this
was
a
good
size
it
was
lacking
in
density
the
smell
is
yuck
nothing
but
corn
or
rice
or
what
ever
adjunct
has
been
added
to
this
brew
the
smell
does
not
bring
to
mind
malts
or
hops
taste
is
bland
no
flavor
of
desire
comes
through
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
beware
what
you
reach
for
as
you
might
get
one
of
these
when
there
are
far
better
american
macros
out
there
overall
it
is
the
king
of
american
macro
brewing
so
i
give
credit
for
that
but
praising
macrobrewed
american
beer
is
a
backhanded
compliment
indeed
taste
is
really
mellow
with
a
crisp
and
dry
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
mainly
grainy
i
think
bud
fits
the
profile
of
a
american
macro
pretty
well
however
with
limited
choices
and
friends
egging
me
on
i
took
one
can
ive
been
drinking
heavier
stuff
lately
so
it
tasted
like
water
slightly
flavored
water
but
still
so
i
suppose
bud
is
drinkable
its
just
not
good
its
appeal
is
that
it
has
no
flavor
and
its
cheap
like
mcdonalds
we
all
cheat
a
little
on
our
diets
so
bud
is
the
guilty
pleasure
of
the
beer
nut
after
all
it
could
be
worse
it
could
have
a
taste
and
yes
if
they
had
the
reach
mgd
would
try
to
take
over
the
world
cup
too
blame
fifa
not
bud
the
perennial
pale
us
maco
lager
thats
all
it
is
and
it
fills
that
niche
well
if
you
come
at
it
from
any
other
frame
of
reference
you
destroy
your
objectivity
so
what
does
budweiser
taste
like
almost
nothing
really
bud
has
a
clean
taste
compared
to
the
bottom
rung
beers
but
tastes
rather
impure
compared
to
what
brewers
are
capable
of
its
easy
to
see
why
its
so
popular
but
for
anyone
who
is
looking
to
experience
beer
with
a
corngrainy
smell
its
a
very
light
beer
but
this
has
a
nice
and
crisp
flavor
no
hops
noticeable
taste
is
dry
and
inoffensive

what
was
left
was
a
craving
for
beer
i
had
to
wait
through
the
door
prizes
before
i
could
hurry
home
and
have
something
with
malt
and
hops
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
large
head
full
of
large
soapy
looking
bubbles
nose
hmmm
didnt
really
pick
up
that
much
and
im
afraid
that
if
i
try
too
hard
ill
end
up
snorting
this
beer
instead
of
drinking
it
first
taste
doesnt
yield
much
information
this
beer
doesnt
want
to
be
profiled
finally
a
sweet
malt
flavor
from
cereals
comes
through
on
the
finish
there
is
nothing
too
offending
about
this
beer
but
there
isnt
really
anything
redeeming
about
it
either
i
guess
bud
will
always
have
a
place
on
the
shelf
and
it
continues
to
provide
enjoyment
to
a
slew
of
people
as
for
me
ill
leave
the
bud
to
all
those
who
enjoy
it
this
beer
is
good
i
guess
for
a
macro
but
not
compared
to
much
anything
else
it
may
be
good
to
have
around
when
your
working
hard
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
probably
not
for
much
else
i
figured
id
give
this
beer
more
of
a
chance
inead
of
bashing
it
so
much
still
not
impressed
but
its
a
step
better
tha
a
lot
of
its
macro
competion
basically
i
will
drink
bud
only
if
theres
no
other
beer
available
like
at
a
ball
game
or
street
fair
where
ab
has
obtained
monopoly
status
even
then
i
may
pour
out
the
last
14
of
the
cup
or
choose
a
coke
or
lemonade
instead
i
cant
really
say
its
a
bad
beer
just
mediocreminus
well
yeah
maybe
i
can
some
of
my
friends
call
it
buttwiper
or
crudweiser
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
beer
with
almost
no
head
i
wont
surprise
anybody
by
saying
that
there
is
no
aftertaste
and
general
aroma
is
very
weak
pretty
much
the
only
thing
i
could
pickup
was
some
sweetness
i
personally
dont
care
about
this
but
i
got
to
admit
that
this
the
perfect
macro
beer
i
e
no
taste
no
head
a
little
bit
sweet
for
that
extra
refreshing
feeling

everything
that
people
who
dont
really
like
beer
but
still
drink
it
like
to
see
and
taste
bud
the
american
icon
of
beer
well
i
guess
we
are
known
better
for
other
things
than
our
beer
here
in
america
popular
drink
at
my
local
biker
bar
in
cleveland
everyone
here
seems
to
be
split
between
it
and
rolling
rock
again
i
say
local
biker
bar
mostly
folks
who
have
never
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
anything
besides
bud
so
i
drink
it
on
occasion
when
i
win
one
off
the
pool
table
color
is
unimpressive
reminiscent
of
urine
in
a
bottle
smell
is
pretty
much
nonexisetent
after
taste
isnt
too
bad
flat
and
uninspiring
which
lends
to
its
drinkability
as
you
can
chug
it
like
a
bottle
of
water
the
taste
itself
is
beer
like
but
no
strong
features
about
it
in
any
department
i
would
cringe
when
i
was
stationed
in
germany
and
drinking
at
a
local
bar
when
i
would
see
young
servicemembers
come
in
and
order
a
buttwiper
your
in
germany
for
gods
sake
home
of
bier
forget
voting
for
president
vs
king
of
beers
we
need
a
revolution
and
institute
a
dictatorship
where
all
beer
is
required
to
taste
good
whatever
its
bud
i
got
an
18
pack
and
an
accompanying
seattle
seahawks
tshirt
as
a
present
and
im
not
enough
of
a
snob
to
criticize
the
giftgivers
perception
of
my
taste
in
beer
of
course
theres
the
almost
clear
yellow
color
and
the
hint
of
actual
beer
taste
but
as
long
as
its
really
cold
and
you
arent
drinking
enough
to
get
to
headache
levels
decent
alternative
to
a
soft
drink
note
that
this
bud
was
brewed
under
licence
by
labatts
bud
is
one
of
the
most
tasteless
brews
i
have
ever
encountered
and
had
the
unfortunate
luck
of
consuming
if
its
free
then
it
makes
it
less
painful
wedding
reception
to
consume
other
than
its
clear
it
has
no
redeeming
qualitiies
in
my
book
pure
crap
in
a
can
or
bottle
with
a
headache
attached
if
you
drink
too
much
free
at
a
party
reviewing
bud
is
a
tough
assignment
on
the
one
hand
im
pretty
sure
the
piss
from
the
horses
in
the
commercial
are
what
they
bottle
and
sell
to
us
as
the
beer
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
cultural
icon
and
a
dynasty
of
a
football
team
managing
to
beat
out
bud
light
for
the
budbowl
three
years
in
a
row
which
in
this
age
of
free
agency
and
salary
caps
is
quite
an
achievement
reviewing
bud
is
like
reviewing
america
and
it
turns
out
we
like
crap
that
we
can
make
a
lot
of
henry
ford
i
salute
you
if
you
feel
the
need
to
drink
this
shyte
make
sure
that
you
have
some
gatorade
and
extra
strength
tylenol
on
hand
the
next
morning
is
comparable
to
death
warmed
over
headache
in
a
bottle
the
beer
after
its
pour
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
an
unclouded
light
yellow
with
the
head
modest
in
size
frothy
in
texture
and
the
color
a
bright
white
as
it
dissolves
quite
quickly
the
lace
a
thin
sheet
nose
is
malt
and
clean
fresh
with
the
start
lightly
sweet
with
fair
to
middling
rice
profile
the
top
skeletal
in
feel
finish
is
stern
in
its
acidity
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
dry
aftertaste
it
is
what
it
is
a
mass
produced
beer
and
at
one
time
many
years
ago
it
was
my
beer
of
choice
wow
got
a
sample
of
the
factory
fresh
bottled
that
day
budweiser
woo
hoo
i
was
promised
that
factory
fresh
bud
was
amazing
and
well
nope
poured
the
same
weak
colour
that
it
always
is
a
bit
of
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
of
grain
and
not
much
else
taste
is
well
boring
no
hops
its
like
lite
malt
and
nothing
else
mouthfeel
isnt
horrid
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
low
i
dont
know
why
but
bud
gives
me
a
headache
every
time
it
maybe
the
king
of
beers
but
well
i
dont
like
royalty
bud
cans
everyone
knows
what
this
beer
tastes
like
even
though
some
people
will
never
admit
it
so
why
review
it
its
the
largest
selling
beer
in
the
world
its
yellow
carbonated
sweet
and
cold
enough
tasteless
but
they
sell
gazillion
gallons
of
this
stuff
its
cheap
enough
for
your
parties
where
nobody
knows
good
beer
the
can
fits
nicely
in
your
hand
at
95
degrees
out
it
flows
easily
down
your
throat
you
could
fit
a
bunch
in
your
cooler
not
my
first
second
or
fourtyish
choice
but
everyso
often
there
is
a
bud
can
in
my
hand
i
drink
this
when
my
friends
buy
and
they
know
no
better
and
ive
given
up
trying
to
lead
them
to
better
beer
sigh
the
taste
of
this
beer
varies
from
time
to
time
sometimes
flavourless
other
times
tolerable
i
could
not
have
more
than
one
sip
makes
club
soda
taste
decent
aggressive
carbonation
with
metallic
behind
it
some
bitter
sweetness
hit
me
and
thats
it
wheres
the
water
there
is
some
fruity
aroma
here
pale
colour
of
some
fizz
definately
awful
looking
well
well
well
the
king
of
beers
when
you
pure
this
beer
in
a
glass
and
take
a
look
at
it
you
see
a
really
light
bodied
lager
where
is
the
head
it
really
looks
like
a
light
beer
the
taste
isnt
the
best
but
it
is
drinkable
i
can
always
pick
up
a
ricy
taste
in
this
beer
i
will
drink
this
beer
occasionally
and
many
of
times
it
is
the
only
beer
available
at
some
establishments
as
for
buying
it
on
a
regular
basis
i
will
definetely
pass
in
my
opinion
the
bud
name
is
so
popular
do
to
many
years
of
advertising
most
people
drink
this
beer
just
for
the
name
not
very
drinkable
after
about
2
starts
to
taste
like
sweat
i
was
going
into
this
beer
expecting
to
taste
swill
though
i
had
a
surprise
when
it
wasnt
as
totally
disgusting
as
i
had
imagined
it
i
have
had
its
light
counterpart
in
the
past
and
this
i
expected
to
be
a
magnitude
greater
in
terribleness
however
this
beer
was
significantly
better
than
bud
light
i
have
to
say
that
this
higher
rating
must
be
due
to
the
keg
as
opposed
to
the
bottle
pours
light
amber
little
diffuse
head
smells
of
hops
alcohol
and
stink
i
didnt
let
this
one
get
warm
at
all
for
fear
of
retribution
very
cold
it
goes
down
surprisingly
smoothly
has
a
little
flavor
not
very
bitter
i
did
enjoy
this
much
more
than
i
would
have
thought
a
beet
with
minimal
flavor
in
that
it
has
more
than
bud
light
but
i
work
in
a
grocery
sotre
and
we
sell
a
hell
of
a
lot
fo
the
stuff
i
guess
it
wouldent
be
bad
if
you
are
in
an
economic
crunch
or
something
but
i
cant
see
too
many
reasons
to
pick
this
up
when
you
have
a
beer
case
full
of
much
better
beers
this
beer
reaks
a
foul
odor
and
does
not
taste
much
better
i
keep
hoping
peopel
who
really
like
this
are
just
uneducated
drinkers
because
theres
way
better
out
there
poured
a
pale
yellow
not
much
head
faded
fast
smell
was
slightly
hoppy
and
malty
sweetness
taste
follows
the
same
rather
creamy
mouthfeel
kinda
fillinggood
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
for
what
would
be
considered
a
weak
cheap
beer
on
this
site
it
still
is
better
than
most
in
this
category
id
sure
rather
drink
this
than
some
of
the
really
cheap
beer
like
buschlight
golden
anniversarysee
my
review
black
label
old
milwaukeeetc
basically
i
bought
this
one
for
two
reasons
first
to
put
it
on
my
beer
list
and
second
because
i
wanted
the
bowlingpin
shaped
bottle
thats
about
it
eh
its
ok
its
way
better
than
the
bud
light
i
just
drank
some
this
weekend
because
its
a
cheap
alternative
that
was
available
id
have
it
again
in
a
pinch
for
cheap
beer
and
it
was
between
that
and
bud
light
had
some
hop
body
to
it
but
nothing
over
the
edge
or
in
your
face
about
it
i
would
classify
this
as
a
duff
beer
its
there
and
thats
it
that
being
said
i
dont
buy
it
for
home
consumption
but
have
been
known
to
consume
it
otherwise
it
beats
water
however
you
look
at
it
what
a
beautiful
day
drinkability
very
pleasant

it
seems
that
this
beer
is
the
standard

so
its
hard
to
determine
what
it
is
even
supposed

i
guess
the
only
plus
about
this
beer
is
that
it
goes
down

i
could
think
of
while
i
was
drinking
this
was
when
will
the
torture
end
they
call
themselves
the
king
of
beers
the
biggest
selling
beer
in
the
land
was
i
impressed
no
the
light
yellow
color
reminded
me
of
what
a
good
beer
isnt
no
imagination
and
a
funky
flavorless
aftertaste
not
unlike
overcooked
rice
i
think
bud
is
better
straight
from
the
can
or
bottle
with
so
many
other
choices
for
pale
lagers
unbalanced
finish
of
not
enough
hops
very
tasteless
without
getting
too
much
into
the
flavor
profile
here
its
a
very
brief
profile
grain
this
is
truly
a
bad
beer
when
one
considers
the
countless
other
brews
in
this
world
of
ours
appearance
is
typical
for
a

american

comments

the
king
is
a
good
standard
for
american
piss
beers
its
smooth
well
carbonated
and
refreshing
of
course
its
mostly
water
with
little
to
no
body
but
it
goes
good
with
pretzels
pizza
or
a
four
pound
salt
lick
bud
is
what
it
is
they
give
me
soccer
on
tv
for
free
this
isnt
bad
at
all
better
than
basically
any
light
beer
there
is
the
adjuncts
are
still
strong
with
a
rice
flavor
that
is
listed
on
the
bottle
but
it
gives
me
more
taste
than
other
macro
lagers
can
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
something
i
need
after
working
in
this
summer
heat
bud
is
bud
it
is
an
amazing
fact
that
they
can
brew
so
much
of
this
stuff
and
it
always
tastes
the
same
lots
of
better
beers
and
lots
of
beers
that
are
worse
lt
gold
color
large
head
lt
flavor
no
maltyness
some
hoppyness
pilsner
style

but
very
light

neutral
mouthfeel
some
hoppyness
on
tongue
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
aftertaste
is
neutral
slightly
bitter
all
in
all
this
is
what
i
like
to
refer
to
as
a
beer
of
last
resort
ach
this
can
of
bud
came
from
the
ab
brewery
not
labatt
the
difference
is
amazing
when
the
tab
was
opened
an
immediate
smell
of
white
rice
came
wafting
through
the
air
poured
a
typical
budweiser
colour
with
a
very
faint
head
smelled
of
rice
corn
other
adjuncts
and
thats
it
no
malt
no
hops
tasted
bland
sort
of
a
molson
canadian
taste
but
weaker
i
can
see
why
people
slam
this
beer
i
dont
know
why
i
rate
these
i
guess
it
is
because
my
town
is
hung
up
on
nothing
but
macros
everywhere
you
go
pours
yellow
a
little
half
inch
head
yadayada
taste
is
a
little
hoppy
and
malty
served
cold
it
is
drinkable
not
that
bad
contrary
to
aging
beer
they
like
to
tell
you
when
it
will
spoil
i
hate
to
admit
i
drank
this
for
many
years
but
my
excuse
is
i
was
not
aware
of
what
was
available
bud
is
deliberately
brewed
exceptionally
crafted
and
completely
ounded
by
many
this
one
should
be
enjoyed
without
too
much
thought

much

lightning
show
nothing
short
of
awesome
what
a
rockroll
band
huh
very
impressive
this
beer
the
alcohol
taste
prevails
over
the
grain
but
i
dont
care
the
music
is
great
my
wife
is
by
my
side
ill
skip
any
innuendo
to
foreplaylong
time
here
if
you
dont
mind
and
we
have
a
peace
of
mind
as
boston
plays
for
2
and
a
half
hours
a
great
evening
despite
the
rain
an
even
better
band
a
topnotch
lady
by
my
side
but
just
an
adequate
beer
the
taste
somewhat
sweet
reflects
the
maltyness
and
is
a
tad
bitter
at
the
end
but
is
rather
too
soft
and
the
body
is
extremely
watery
which
concurs
with
what
should
be
its
motto
the
king
of
massproduction
i
poured
this
in
a
glass
for
reviewing
purposes
but
i
prefer
to
drink
a
beer
like
this
out
of
the
can
it
just
feels
right
to
me
its
a
pale
clear
yellow
with
little
head
or
carbonation
scent
is
slightly
grainy
actually
somewhat
malty
if
you
get
a
good
whiff
with
some
other
acidic
sort
of
scent
if
that
makes
any
sense
not
a
whole
lot
to
smell
the
taste
is
very
mild
but
not
completely
watery
there
is
something
in
the
taste
of
budweiser
that
sets
it
apart
slighly
from
the
other
american
mass
produced
lagers
just
enough
taste
for
me
to
choose
this
over
say
mgd
of
something
nothing
special
here
but
tolerable
leaves
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
mouthfel
never
noticed
that
before
really
very
easy
to
drink
not
really
that
exciting
to
drink
but
easy
ok
i
am
taking
my
ba
com
ratings
seriously
i
will
even
rate
a
ugh
must
i
say
it
budweiser
it
has
a
mild
fruity
to
no
aroma
it
has
a
head
of
fine
bubbles
that
disappears
quickly
and
body
with
a
watery
weak
light
yellow
color
you
can
taste
the
carbonation
in
you
r
mouth
i
look
at
the
glass
and
bubbles
are
still
rising
off
its
bottom
i
belch
after
the
first
taste
i
can
still
taste
the
carbonation
on
my
front
teeth
the
flavor
is
weak
to
nonexistent
definitely
a
nocharacter
brew
there
is
no
real
flavor
to
speak
of
there
was
very
little
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
i
belch
again
must
i
drink
more
of
this
swill
ok
i
finished
the
glass
and
just
had
to
come
back
and
add
one
more
point
i
did
get
a
buzz
off
this
beer
and
for
a
cheap
drunk
i
had
to
bump
up
its
rating
after
all
it
was
only
0
89
this
beer
poured
a
large
white
frothy
head
with
small
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
there
was
no
lacing
with
this
beer
the
body
was
clear
and
yellow
in
hue
the
carbonation
was
fizzy
the
aroma
was
somewhat
fruity
the
initial
flavor
was
moderately
sweet
and
the
finishing
flavor
was
lightly
sweet
and
lightly
acidic
the
mouthfeel
was
light
thin
and
watery
pours
golden
pale
with
a
soft
white
head
that
fades
immediately
the
aroma
is
mosty
green
apples
and
sour
maltiness
the
taste
is
clean
inoffensive
and
pretty
much
nonexistent
this
beer
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
so
i
guess
that
is
worth
something
but
i
was
painting
my
bedroom
midday
and
any
other
beer
might
have
made
me
tipsy
enough
to
have
problems
with
edging
fortuantely
i
was
able
to
drink
several
budwiesers
and
still
get
the
job
done
a
beer
so
inoffensive
its
offensive
a
light
straw
color
some
hops
and
corn
on
the
nose
but
overally
unoffensive
some
light
malt
and
light
hops
are
detected
thin
bodied
obvious
adjuncts
and
a
watery
finish
lacks
a
true
body
but
overall
drinkable
when
backed
in
a
corner
the
king
in
lower
case
letters
pours
a
mild
goden
color
topped
by
a
loose
white
head
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
distinct
grainy
note
the
taste
is
pretty
mellow
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
on
the
finish
and
something
resembling
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
agressive
due
to
the
large
and
prevalent
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
a
little
less
than
average
as
i
cant
seem
to
stomach
more
than
one
of
these
ever
this
beer
has
almost
all
the
qualities
of
a
lager
i
dont
like
and
none
that
i
do
the
king
of
beers
on
volume
alone
i
must
admit
that
they
always
taste
identical
it
poured
a
pale
unimpressive
yellow
but
the
head
retention
was
surprisingly
good
smell
was
of
hops
corn
and
some
funky
odor
that
i
cant
place
not
bad
enough
to
discourage
consumption
but
enough
to
discourage
further
smelling
the
taste
was
uneventful
carbonated
beerflavored
water
dry
finish
with
almost
a
hint
of
hops
this
beers
best
suit
you
can
pound
them
back
one
after
the
other
and
its
better
than
bud
light
an
average
mouthfeel
but
overall
a
drinkibility
thats
hard
to
beat
if
im
not
drinking
homebrew
or
micros
nothing
beats
a
bud
for
this
kid
i
dont
care
about
the
mass
marketing
and
that
im
paying
to
keep
the
speedboat
running
or
the

going

consistantly
decent
product
that
has
its
rightfull
place
in
beerdom
diesel
is
probably
one
of
my
favorites
made
by
the
annheuiser
busch
corporation
it
actually
goes
down
very
well
and
i
can
see
why
it
lives
up
to
the
name
of
the
king
of
all
beers
although
changing
the
logo
to
modernize
the
brand
might
not
hurt
either
from
a
marketing
aspect
definately
not
that
good
a
very
pale
coloured
beer
with
little
to
no
head
this
is
ok
to
drink
if
it
is
the
only
option
but
otherwise
i
would
go
with
almost
anything
else
this
tastes
like
beer
flavoured
water
and
it
has
basically
no
mouthfeel
it
does
not
smell
too
great
either
and
the
drinkability
is
crap
it
is
better
in
the
bottle
than
it
is
in
the
can
though
in
my
opinion
the
king
of
beers
is
the
best
of
the
american
macros
do
i
really
need
to
explain
it
to
anyone
i
go
to
school
in
williamsburg
right
next
to
busch
gardems
and
the
bud
brewery
and
this
beer
is
everywhere
this
is
always
the
beer
that
i
choose
when
i
go
somewhere
that
doesnt
have
decent
imports
much
better
than
the
silver
bullet
or
the
god
awful
bud
light
if
you
go
to
pizza
hut
or
outback
then
id
take
this
however
if
youre
drinking
in
your
house
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
a
decent
beer
it
is
hardly
worth
the
money
it
costs
but
is
not
a
beer
you
should
snobbishly
refuse
if
offered
why
did
i
drink
this
oh
yeah
i
was
at
a
bowling
alley
and
then
hung
out
with
people
that
have
no
respect
for
even
halfway
decent
beer
when
you
say
budweiseryou
want
to
hurl
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
beer
for
folks
who
hate
beer
king
indeed
the
emperor
has
no
clothes
most
everyone
here
puts
this
drink
in
a
certain
category
macroswill
that
it
may
be
but
as
far
as
it
goes
in
that
category
it
cant
be
topped
i
have
loved
this
beer
since
the
first
time
i
drank
it
now
i
put
it
at
the
top
of
the
shitbeers
category
nothing
special
by
any
means
but
if
all
else
fails
this
is
your
gotoguy
i
had
this
recently
while
sitting
in
the
stands
of
an
irl
race
here
in
phoenix
since
the
aluminum
bleachers
were
cooking
us
a
nice
medium
rare
we
had
to
drink
something
and
you
dont
drink
water
during
a
race
so
i
got
a
big
22
oz
can
of
budweiser
king
of
beers
after
my
first
sip
i
think
bud
should
be
know
as
the
queen
of
beers
because
it
is
so
outdone
by
the
micros
of
today
it
makes
bud
look
like
the
richard
simmons
of
the
group
however
it
did
quench
my
thirst
since
the
flavor
was
not
too
overpowering
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
the
taste
just
has
an
unnatural
flavor
to
it
possibly
from
the
aluminum
can
but
it
sits
in
my
mouth
longer
that
i
like
its
not
horrible
i
just
can
think
of
many
other
beers
i
would
have
much
rather
had
after
all
these
years
of
trying
this
beer
the
best
thing
about
it
is
its
consistency
you
always
know
what
your
about
to
taste
when
you
have
a
cold
one
usually
i
was
at
my
local
burger
joint
and
they
had
all
american
tap
beers
for
1
50
for
16
oz
i
have
not
had
an
american
lager
in
a
lonnnggg
time
so
i
gave
bud
a
try
it
was
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
and
had
a
good
sturdy
head
the
aroma
was
as
i
remembered
absent
it
tasted
crisp
and
had
a
slight
bite
of
hops
the
beer
was
very
cold
and
i
could
not
detect
any
adjuncts
probably
just
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
had
some
good
carbonation
tingle
for
eating
a
hot
pepper
burger
and
fries
this
beer
hit
the
spot
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
it
to
go
down
and
had
to
throw
out
half
of
it
it
has
turned
me
off
to
a
lot
of
pilsners
because
im
afraid
they
will
taste
the
same
just
say
no
i
believe
adolphus
busch
would
roll
over
in
his
grave
if
knew
what
had
become
of
his
beloved
brewery
the
largest
brewing
company
on
the
planet
and
no
doubt
has
the
largest
payroll
for
lawyers
accountants
marketing
and
advertising
to
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
they
do
have
remarkable
advertising
campaigns
the
beer
itself
is
totally
unremarkable
the
lager
is
straw
is
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
thin
body
is
made
possible
by
liberal
quantities
of
rice
the
aroma
smells
of
cardboard
and
stale
dishwater
with
a
trace
of
hops
the
flavor
is
bland
with
the
exception
of
the
seltzery
fizz
and
a
slightly
bitter
back
of
the
throat
hop
bitterness
dry
with
some
sweetness
but
overall
stale
tastingeven
within
the
born
on
date
limits
i
wish
they
would
put
as
much
energy
into
brewing
a
really
high
quality
lager
as
they
do
in
bullying
smaller
brewers
with
their
vast
and
powerful
legal
team
there
is
just
nothing
i
enjoy
about
this
beer
i
cant
describe
the
taste
element
that
tuns
me
off
so
much
perhaps
it
is
the
type
of
hops
that
is
in
every
anheuserbusch
product
the
appearance
is
ok
but
this
is
just
a
typically
macro
brew
as
to
be
below
average
in
the
categories
all
in
all
id
rather
drink
almost
anything
else
i
felt
weird
pouring
this
can
into
a
glass
you
might
as
well
drink
it
out
of
the
can
because
the
appearance
is
just
a
super
pale
straw
color
with
no
head
after
10
seconds
the
aroma
was
a
whole
lot
of
air
i
really
couldnt
smell
anything
from
this
beer
i
really
couldnt
taste
much
of
anything
either
the
carbonation
is
zingy
on
my
tongue
this
beer
defines
bland
theres
really
not
much
else
to
say
a
boring
beer
the
ford
taurus
of
beers
i
consider
the
taurus
a
very
boring
yet
smooth
driving
car
i
as
im
sure
most
beer
drinkers
have
had
budweiser
many
times
in
my
life
the
only
time
i
drank
it
consistently
was
for
a
while
when
i
was
about
19
or
20
and
i
liked
it
out
of
the
can
it
never
really
was
my
favorite
i
preferred
michelob
in
those
days
to
rate
this
i
had
it
in
a
taste
test
with
three
of
the
highest
rated
american
lagers
yeungling
miller
high
life
and
pabst
blue
ribbon
the
bud
was
by
far
the
worst
looking
beer
of
the
group
as
pale
as
any
beer
ive
ever
seen
small
head
disappeared
almost
immediately
no
lacing
smell
was
nuetral
taste
is
not
bad
in
this
company
i
am
not
a
fan
of
american
lagers
and
this
tasting
did
not
make
me
want
to
go
back
to
the
old
days
this
being
said
there
is
nothing
offputting
about
bud
and
it
was
as
good
as
the
miller
or
pabst
the
yuengling
as
expected
was
the
best
of
the
bunch
bud
is
a
refreshing
drinkable
beer
good
for
barbecues
fairs
and
the
beach
but
for
my
tastes
i
could
find
something
if
available
that
i
would
prefer
even
in
those
circumstances
ultimately
just
too
damn
nuetral
i
took
one
sip
out
of
the
can
for
old
times
sake
and
it
was
better
than
in
a
glass
these
beers
are
not
good
when
left
naked
all
in
all
a
delightful
experience
like
i
said
i
prefer
cold
water
but
i
really
wanted
to
say
good
things
about
this
beer
it
is
the
american
beer
like
it
or
not
pours
average
with
dismal
head
this
is
brewed
with
rice
as
the
main
ingredient
but
what
you
get
is
cereal
grains
and
more
cereal
grains
very
dry
with
only
a
slight
remnant
of
hops
this
is
the
ultimate
macro
its
ingredients
are
crap
so
is
the
end
result
disappointed
to
say
the
least
notes
i
guess
its
a
decent
american
pilsner
zillions
of
people
like
it
its
not
really
to
my
taste
and
theres
something
in
it
that
doesnt
work
well
in
my
bloodstream
i
always
seem
to
get
a
headache
when
i
drink
this
beer
funky
chemicals
compared
to
an
aching
head
from
a
5
sixpack
of
bud
its
worth
the
extra
1
to
buy
local
micro
brew
instead
andor
beers
that
adhere
to
the
german
brewing
purity
laws
i
can
drink
one
bud
safely
but
if
i
plan
to
drink
more
than
one
ill
drive
to
town
and
buy
something
i
can
process
better
drinkability
well
i
dont
think
it
is
drinkable
for
enjoyment
if
you
would
like
to
put
away
a
number
of
these
i
bet
you
could
it
is
smooth
and
practically
flavorless
although
this
is
a
less
than
average
beer
i
have
to
give
it
some
credit
out
of
all
the
american
macrobrews
excluding
sam
adams
it
is
my
favorite
not
only
does
it
have
decent
alcohol
content
but
it
has
a
decent
taste
nothing
great
here
but
it
is
heck
of
a
lot
better
than
any
light
beers
pours
thin
and
light
nice
initial
head
but
loses
overall
carbonation
rather
quickly
its
a
hop
soda
pop
and
smells
better
than
it
tastes
after
the
first
few
sips
of
bud
lager
all
traces
of
hop
and
malt
are
gone
kind
of
like
a
carbonated
water
really
nothing
to
love
or
hate
about
it
highly
drinkable
whats
all
the
hubub
about
bud
would
i
ever
buy
a
chase
for
home
use
no
even
for
guests
no
theres
better
yellow
lagers
that
i
would
actually
want
to
drink
would
i
turn
up
my
nose
if
offered
a
cold
one
no
id
drink
it
quickly
would
i
choke
down
a
warm
one
no
actually
death
would
be
better
truth
be
told
nothing
to
complex
here
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
fairly
good
foamy
white
head
has
a
nutty
wheat
taste
with
a
seltzer
like
mouthfeel
the
only
thing
that
makes
budweiser
the
king
is
the
price
and
its
drinkability
quality
they
are
easy
to
pound
when
your
at
a
bar
or
a
hockey
game
or
your
just
on
a
diet
from
darker
beers
for
awhile
not
a
very
good
beerbut
it
serves
its
purpose
sometimes
i
must
add
that
its
the
only
beer
that
gives
me
a
pounding
headache
the
next
day
it
never
fails
even
if
i
only
drink
a
few
i
still
get
a
headache
what
do
they
put
in
this
crap
pours
a
bright
pale
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
carbonation
is
very
good
on
the
nose
there
isnt
much
going
on
slight
graininess
pretty
much
just
clean
aroma
on
the
palate
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
crisp
traces
of
malt
grassy
taste
slight
apple
flavor
in
there
light
grain
but
overall
very
clean
and
to
the
point
always
fresh
is
what
makes
it
drinkable
crisp
refreshing
but
hardly
any
flavor
its
golden
its
beer
it
is
consistant
not
much
else
pours
pale
light
yellow
color
some
head
very
strange
looking
grainy
chemical
aroma
no
flavor
hops
or
malt
the
rice
adjunct
takes
away
the
flavors
light
body
and
clean
finish
i
used
to
drink
alot
of
this
a
long
time
ago
being
from
st
louis
i
thought
it
was
the
best
i
was
wrong
there
are
much
better
american
lagers
pbr
high
life
and
so
on
i
dont
like
paying
extra
for
their
marketing
they
do
have
great
commercials
not
worth
the
price
too
much
hype
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
tap
glass
though
its
very
close
to
water
at
least
its
not
natural
light
or
bud
light
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
white
head
not
any
overwhelming
flavor
just
a
very
basic
beer
nothing
objectionable
about
the
flavor
but
nothing
that
jumps
out
as
being
great
a
good
beer
for
quenching
thirst
as
opposed
to
drinking
for
enjoyment
one
of
the
most
known
brand
and
one
of
the
last
choices
on
my
list
pale
coloured
no
particular
smell
or
taste
com
on
guys
i
know
you
can
do
better
than
this
all
it
takes
is
a
little
effort
this
is
the
king
of
malt
based
rice
beverages
anyway
i
am
troubled
by
1
the
fact
they
brag
they
use
rice
on
the
label
2
this
beer
is
so
lacking
in
body
taste
and
especially
hops
that
they
should
not
even
call
it
a
beer
ive
said
it
before
augie
busch
would
go
to
jail
if
he
brewed
this
in
germany
and
ive
taken
this
beer
down
a
couple
of
notches
as
ab
is
the
evil
empire
and
my
friends
at
work
said
that
i
would
not
be
impartial
when
i
reviewed
this
huh
questioning
my
beer
intergrity
what
do
they
know
a
slight
step
up
from
original
coors
but
not
quite
millers
this
is
still
a
borrrrrring
beer
and
it
seems
to
have
a
watered
down
taste
just
nothing
there
took
a
tour
of
the
brewery
in
fairfield
california
and
was
interesting
to
bad
the
beer
isnt
after
writing
these
notes
the
identities
of
the
beers
were
revealed
i
was
not
surprised
that
this
was
what
it
was
best
if
taken
in
at
a
rapid
pace
and
very
cold
so
as
to
not
give
room
for
too
much
pondering
on
the
qualities
of
the
beer
while
drinking
it
the
only
reason
i
tried
to
drink
this
because
it
was
the
last
beer
and
the
game
was
under
2
minutes
i
say
tried
because
after
the
first
taste
i
thought
someone
had
slipped
me
a
zima
or
some
other
water
with
alcohol
in
it
whats
the
deal
with
the
continents
listed
on
the
can
is
that
all
the
places
its
been
poured
on
all
in
all
a
thoroughly
unobjectionable
if
unremarkable
beer
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
nothing
special
a
little
sweet
and
something
i
cant
quite
pinpoint
pale
straw
colored
and
crystal
clear
it
has
a
very
thin
body
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
there
is
just
a
little
bit
of
hops
after
the
fizz
just
enough
so
that
it
doesnt
taste
like
all
malt
it
finishes
with
a
little
grain
andor
rice
it
has
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
this
is
definately
the
budweisr
of
well
beer
this
is
garbage
it
is
a
shame
that
it
is
even
included
in
this
site
although
i
might
believe
ab
is
a
disservice
to
the
beer
community
others
may
disagree
and
i
gladly
support
them
with
that
said
bud
is
horrible
to
look
at
piss
water
from
a
urinal
is
more
easy
on
the
eyes
probably
taste
better
too
why
not
if
you
drink
bud
you
cant
be
that
far
from
sticking
your
head
in
a
urinal
the
mouthfeel
is
like
bad
warm
soda
too
effervescent
this
is
a
very
bloating
and
gassy
product
overloads
the
kidneys
as
well
ab
should
burn
this
recipe
and
pour
the
remaining
barrels
down
the
sewer
i
will
raise
a
glass
of
fine
brew
in
honor
of
the
sewer
that
takes
that
hit
golden
color
dissipating
head
with
little
aroma
straight
forward
malty
flavor
balanced
with
a
few
hops
flavor
and
body
were
pretty
thin
ho
hum
and
harmless
a
better
alternative
than
a
diet
coke
but
not
much
else
crystal
clear
very
light
yellowish
color
topped
by
a
full
and
foamy
bright
white
head
that
holds
very
well
the
carbonation
is
quite
fine
leaving
thin
steady
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
steadily
to
the
surface
nice
appearance
the
aroma
is
quite
limited
with
just
vaugue
indications
of
malt
hops
fermentation
esters
and
alcohol
the
body
is
light
with
a
gentle
carbonation
and
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
quite
onesided
however
with
only
a
very
light
malt
character
ever
so
gently
buoyed
by
hop
bitterness
and
a
light
apple
character
from
fermentation
the
finish
is
short
and
sweet
with
only
a
residual
malt
and
next
to
nonexistant
bitterness
refreshing
this
is
the
best
selling
beer
in
the
world
for
a
reason
although
limited
in
character
it
displays
no
flaws
whatsoever
there
is
nothing
even
remotely
objectable
about
it
a
true
beer
for
the
masses
the
only
thing
that
i
can
find
to
remark
on
is
that
budweiser
king
of
beers
is
quite
unremarkable
this
bud
does
not
offend
the
buds
but
it
does
nothing
for
them
either
my
recommendation
since
im
not
an
ab
hater
i
would
recommend
this
with
pizza
or
hanging
out
with
the
guys
just
a
normal
beer
when
you
dont
want
anything
special
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
its
just
another
way
to
consume
some
alcohol
without
to
much
trouble
refrshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
so
is
water
its
rather
dull
in
all
fields
king
of
beers
i
think
not
well
maybe
in
a
frat
house
clear
light
straw
hue
topped
by
a
thin
head
that
manages
to
leave
lace
a
hint
of
green
apple
in
aroma
but
theres
not
much
else
there
flavorwise
its
quite
bland
light
husky
6
row
barley
notes
and
light
residual
sweetness
due
to
the
paltry
hopping
are
all
that
is
there
hop
flavor
is
virtually
nonexistant
and
can
be
overlooked
altogether
thin
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
clean
and
abrupt
this
was
my
first
bud
in
years
lousy
appelbees
and
will
probably
be
my
last
no
outright
flaws
in
bud
however
just
a
total
lack
of
character
it
claims
to
be
the
king
of
beers
but
a
quick
look
at
the
ingredient
list
makes
you
wonder
quite
how
it
even
manages
to
be
a
subject
in
the
beer
kingdom
let
alone
the
ruler
then
you
taste
it
and
what
hops
and
malt
it
does
have
in
it
are
nowhere
to
be
found
a
great
example
of
the
power
of
advertising
why
else
would
so
many
people
pay
to
drink
something
that
the
rest
of
us
get
out
of
our
taps
okay
my
friends
caught
me
in
my
neiborhood
on
the
way
to
my
craftbeer
friendly
bettys
so
since
one
just
got
back
from
his
honeymoon
i
had
a
beer
with
them
this
beer
on
tap
is
why
i
avoid
it
whenever
it
is
usually
offered
on
tap
the
beer
was
a
light
straw
color
with
very
little
head
and
no
lace
the
aroma
was
next
nothing
and
was
mostly
hops
and
grain
the
flavor
was
faint
and
basically
hops
and
grain
with
a
bite
to
it
the
finish
was
very
light
with
little
character
and
a
bit
of
a
bit
to
it
as
much
as
this
beer
suffers
in
can
and
bottles
i
think
it
fares
the
worst
as
a
draft
and
i
am
an
old
seasoned
budweiser
drinker
this
is
perhaps
my
favorite
macro
the
color
is
a
deeper
golden
than
most
other
macros
giving
one
the
impression
that
it
will
have
more
flavor
the
smell
is
a
little
bitter
but
not
offending
in
my
book
the
bitterness
follows
through
into
the
flavor
but
leaves
relatively
quickly
i
am
not
one
to
say
i
hate
all
macros
and
i
like
this
for
a
change
every
once
in
a
while
one
of
the
best
macros
in
my
opinion
update
an
icecold
32
oz
draw
of
the
lowpoint
4abv
version
of
bud
seemed
to
hit
the
spot
on
a
nice
warm
fall
day
at
the
tulsa
state
fair
i
have
to
confess
i
actually
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
brew
while
walking
arond
at
the
fair
i
also
know
id
never
buy
it
and
drink
it
day
in
and
day
out
ever
i
love
beer
but
if
this
were
the
only
beer
in
the
world
well
i
say
pass
the
tea
this
beer
has
no
characteristic
that
impresses
me
except
for
the
marketing
of
anheuserbusch
it
gicves
me
headaches
among
other
things
lol
and
well
lets
just
say
great
commercials
ab
but
work
on
the
beer
cheers
budweiser
is
simply
a
good
dare
i
say
great
beer
it
doesnt
cost
50
dollars
a
case
and
no
one
will
think
youre
high
society
when
you
tell
them
you
drink
bud
but
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
the
truth
is
if
you
truely
love
beer
as
i
do
and
your
not
just
some
frasier
with
a
pention
for
beer
instead
of
wine
then
you
must
agree
this
beer
rules
the
school
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
this
will
do
the
trick
no
head
aches
unless
you
posses
a
vagina
and
even
then
it
is
a
matter
of
chance
it
goes
down
like
ice
water
and
it
taste
great
scourge
of
all
those
who
enjoy
good
beer
a
beer
that
is
an
american
classic
and
worth
revisiting
from
time
to
time
clear
slight
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
very
light
color
no
noticible
smell
other
than
a
slight
maltskunk
smell
taste
has
a
sweetness
but
the
brew
is
very
bland
first
off
let
me
say
ive
always
been
a
miller
man
worked
on
the
delivery
trucks
during
college
and
have
always
thought
bud
to
be
the
worst
of
the
worst
well
that
may
be
overstating
it
there
are
many
beers
worse
than
this
cheaper
beers
with
bad
off
flavors
this
is
certainly
no
powerhouse
of
flavor
it
pours
a
disgusting
very
very
light
straw
colorbasically
pour
a
glass
full
of
water
and
then
drop
in
two
or
three
drops
of
piss
for
color
and
you
have
this
color
it
is
not
bad
but
really
doesnt
have
much
taste
some
soft
maltrice
tones
but
overall
it
is
pretty
tasteless
and
easy
to
drink
no
hops
at
all
tastes
like
a
light
beer
had
this
at
the
ballgame
bought
by
a
friend
not
a
beer
advocate
mind
you
much
the
same
as
i
remembered
from
my
youth
slightly
sweet
ricelike
definitely
not
skunky
id
probably
take
this
over
a
heineken
there
are
worse
tasting
beers
out
there
but
there
are
far
far
more
better
tasting
beers
as
well
at
least
this
is
consistently
subaverage
footbal
soccer
nascar
etc
for
some
reason
budweiser
just
goes
real
well
while
watching
a
good
event
its
very
drinkable
and
smells
good
otherwise
its
just
well
bud
ahhh
liquid
rice
this
is
only
the
most
popular
beer
in
america
because
as
george
carlin
says
they
smear
their
logo
feces
everywhere
the
only
reason
to
drink
this
stuff
is
if
you
are
already
plowed
and
its
on
special
at
the
bar
in
addition
its
far
too
expensive
for
the
poor
quality
stick
with
something
else
i
hadnt
had
a
budweiser
in
a
long
time
when
my
neighbor
an
ab
employee
gave
me
a
sixpack
that
was
two
days
old
it
was
better
than
the
stuff
thats
been
sitting
around
forever
but
it
was
still
budweiser
on
the
rare
occasion
i
do
drink
a
bud
its
usually
out
of
the
can
or
a
plastic
cup
at
a
baseball
game
pouring
this
stuff
into
a
clean
glass
was
someting
of
a
shock
its
barely
a
shade
darker
than
water
it
more
or
less
smells
like
water
too
by
the
time
i
saw
and
smelled
it
the
watery
taste
came
as
no
surprise
i
like
it
better
than
coors
but
thats
not
saying
much
fortunately
most
of
the
beer
i
get
from
my
neighbor
is
his
homebrew
ahh
the
old
red
and
white
looks
like
colored
water
tastes
like
colored
water
and
smells
like
it
too
i
can
definitely
taste
some
adjuncts
probably
the
rice
incredibly
carbonated
you
will
still
be
burping
in
an
hour
i
would
have
to
say
that
among
the
macros
most
ab
products
are
on
the
bottom
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
well
i
have
always
been
a
huge
budweiser
fan
hey
its
not
extremely
complex
but
it
is
a
great
thirst
quenching
beer
and
they
are
a
very
respectable
company
when
it
comes
to
the
pride
they
put
into
their
product
they
are
legendary
and
always
will
be
and
i
will
always
take
a
bud
over
most
of
the
other
typical
beers
coors
light
miller
rolling
rock
etc
i
cant
manage
to
choke
down
a
full
bottlecanglass
of
the
stuff
i
can
at
least
polish
off
a
nasty
light
dont
think
ive
ever
been
able
to
finish
a
bottle
or
cup
of
draft
of
the
stuff
im
guarenteed
to
start
gagging
before
i
get
to
the
bottom
third
that
and
its
overpriced
for
what
it
is
i
dont
diss
the
beer
because
im
trying
to
judge
it
for
something
its
not
im
dissing
it
because
i
cant
drink
it
very
lightcolored
and
smells
as
refreshing
as
it
tastes
goes
down
smooth
and
stays
down
smooth
a
lot
of
people
like
to
knock
bud
but
at
least
it
makes
no
pretenses
and
ill
fall
back
on
it
anytime
clean
refreshing
and
inordinately
drinkableavailable
in
30packs
for
a
good
reason
you
know
going
in
that
its
not
meant
to
challenge
your
taste
buds
so
just
take
it
for
what
it
is
and
enjoy
what
could
be
the
easydrinkingest
beer
in
america
time
to
weigh
in
on
the
big
boy
sadly
second
to
bud
light
in
sales
in
the
us
what
have
we
come
to
americanbuy
american
as
some
have
said
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
are
american
micros
so
its
not
a
case
of
preferring
a
german
macro
product
bud
is
very
consistent
with
the
production
and
delivery
capacity
to
prove
it
and
adjunct
clean
but
alas
has
no
flavor
other
than
sweetremotest
bitter
in
the
most
fleeting
way
so
in
the
case
of
comparing
it
to
urine
cmon
is
it
like
that
acrid
smell
a
standard
setter
for
style
and
i
have
no
problem
drinking
one
the
color
is
lesser
than
many
macros
but
the
flavor
has
some
pleasant
cereal
grain
notes
actually
bud
is
one
my
favorite
macros
for
style
think
about
this
how
much
does
ab
spend
on
advertising
and
how
much
do
you
pay
for
a
six
now
remove
the
ad
budget
yep
its
a
2
50
a
six
beer
and
not
even
a
good
2
50
a
six
beer
but
youre
paying
4
00
a
six
for
the
priovelege
of
looking
at
talking
frogs
and
seeing
people
say
wazzaaaap
feel
dumb
you
should
theres
no
reason
to
subject
your
mouth
to
this
crap
there
really
is
no
reason
appearance
is
watered
down
looking
with
a
soap
bubble
head
taste
is
weak
but
odd
at
the
same
time
with
a
mild
ricesweetness
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
share
with
your
friends
because
most
dont
appreciate
the
imports
anyway
i
drank
plenty
of
this
is
my
younger
days
when
you
look
up
headache
in
the
dictionary
it
reads
drink
12
budweisers
and
take
a
nap
this
lager
should
be
appreciated
for
what
it
is
a
clean
crisp
refreshing
brew
that
appeals
to
the
masses
and
can
be
drank
whenever
and
wherever
there
are
many
other
much
better
lagers
and
ales
that
appeal
to
those
of
us
with
discerning
tastes
and
appreciation
for
really
good
beer
but
after
a
day
of
construction
work
in
the
sweltering
summer
heat
nothing
beats
an
ice
cold
budweiser
just
as
during
the
shortest
and
coldest
of
days
in
winter
sitting
in
my
favorite
pub
a
pint
of
stout
porter
or
doppel
bock
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
people
like
to
pile
on
this
beer
because
it
is
the
largest
selling
beer
in
the
world
and
its
always
fun
to
poke
at
the
guy
on
top
is
it
good
or
is
it
bad
neither
its
right
down
the
middle
it
is
a
cleantasting
american
lager
it
leaves
a
dry
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
but
is
overall
decent
on
a
warm
day
i
have
no
problem
admitting
that
i
dont
mind
drinking
bud
its
only
when
people
say
its
the
only
think
they
drink
is
when
i
find
it
questionable
a
consistant
brew
for
the
unwashed
nascar
masses
it
is
what
it
is
your
basic
bland
american
lager
it
is
very
light
tasting
and
easy
to
drink
every
once
in
a
while
i
pick
some
up
and
when
i
have
the
first
one
i
usually
wonder
why
i
dont
get
this
more
often
and
when
i
finish
the
last
one
i
usually
know
why
my
understanding
is
that
the
beech
wood
aged
propaganda
has
to
do
with
wood
chips
in
the
fermentation
vats
to
increase
the
yeast
surface
area
this
may
explain
why
this
beer
always
seems
to
me
to
have
a
funky
off
flavor
not
to
mention
that
corn
and
rice
adjuncts
seem
to
be
the
major
characteristics
i
hate
to
go
against
the
billions
who
love
this
beer
but
it
is
just
about
my
last
choice
as
i
fish
around
in
the
cooler
while
it
is
true
that
budweiser
is
the
everpresent
american
beer
and
that
it
garnishes
some
blame
from
folks
thinking
it
should
be
other
than
it
is
it
is
in
fact
a
good
allpurpose
beer
it
is
an
excellent
summer
beer
and
goes
well
with
barbeque
yes
i
could
just
have
less
but
better
beer
or
no
beer
at
all
but
during
march
madness
thats
not
an
option
try
it
its
cheap
and
no
worse
than
a
pbr
for
more
abv
the
skunk
mostly
rears
its
head
on
the
very
back
end
the
look
is
reasonable
the
smell
isnt
awful
and
its
not
immediately
a
regretful
decision
to
drink
this
beer
i
think
the
babros
are
closer
to
reasonable
than
the
overall
ba
score
a
perfect
college
beer
its
cheap
and
in
my
opinion
it
tastes
really
good
pours
a
translucent
yellow
with
little
head
the
smell
is
mostly
rice
but
with
some
chemical
smell
almost
metallic
there
is
very
little
to
the
taste
this
was
made
to
be
drank
fast
with
a
slightly
above
average
abv
this
beer
should
be
banned
awful
beer
cheap
beer
beer
pong
type
of
beer
high
abv
for
a
college
beer
thats
the
only
upside
very
dirty
beer
that
has
never
agreed
with
me
well
it
says
i
have
to
justify
says
i
have
to
justify
tastes
like
nothing
just
water
goes
down
easy
enough
and
if
i
wasnt
curious
to
see
if
the
taste
changed
when
it
warmed
it
didnt
i
could
have
tosses
the
glass
back
in
a
blink
like
i
said
easy
drinking
now
i
know
why
its
a
favorite
of
college
students
cheap
inoffensive
and
to
quote
dave
chapelle
itll
get
you
drunk
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
great
beer
im
a
college
student
and
compared
to
other
domestics
especially
cheap
ones
this
is
pretty
good
it
doesnt
have
much
flavor
to
it
at
all
and
is
very
smooth
to
drink
if
its
cold
other
cheap
domestics
like
keystone
or
milwaukees
best
have
an
odd
aftertaste
to
them
but
not
natty
if
i
want
something
with
flavor
i
would
definitely
look
elsewhere
but
if
i
want
a
buzz
to
party
or
need
to
unwind
after
a
hard
day
of
studying
natty
is
perfect
this
isnt
terrible
is
cheap
enough
and
will
make
an
acceptable
tomato
beer
im
drinking
this
while
watching
the
patsies
play
the
dolts
in
the
afc
championship
calling
this
a
beer
is
a
disgrace
this
is
some
real
crap
most
people
nailed
it
by
saying
its
only
good
for
getting
drunk
that
is
true
and
its
cheap
its
faux
beer
for
people
who
want
to
get
drunk
off
of
something
similar
to
beer
and
some
people
talk
about
how
its
refreshing
and
great
for
relaxing
must
be
crazy
to
think
that
if
you
have
5
and
want
to
get
drunk
you
can
get
6
pack
of
16oz
natties
a
couple
of
40s
which
are
far
worse
or
a
small
bottle
of
very
cheep
booze
your
call
one
of
the
best
beers
that
u
can
sit
relax
and
enjoy
the
outdoors
or
anything
really
way
better
then
what
most
of
these
naysayers
here
one
of
and
this
isnt
saying
much
the
better
ice
beers
around
actually
has
some
flavor
to
it
i
am
comparing
this
against
beers
in
its
class
namely
keystone
ice
milwaukees
best
ice
bud
ice
and
busch
ice
compared
to
those
things
this
seems
not
bad
not
that
it
matters
you
drink
a
few
bottles
of
natural
ice
you
forget
all
about
the
flavor
trust
me
this
stuff
will
fk
you
up
they
go
down
incredibly
easy
cold
anyway
dont
do
what
i
did
and
accept
a
wager
to
drink
it
hot
without
puking
its
pretty
awful
hot
then
again
what
beer
isnt
had
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
ice
cold
beats
all
of
these
things
ive
rated
once
it
gets
warm
its
just
as
bad
overall
the
cheapest
drinkable
beer
i
can
find
goes
down
like
water
and
thats
a
good
thing
in
this
case
i
wouldnt
want
to
actually
taste
it
my
daily
drinker
not
the
greatest
beer
on
earth
but
its
cheap
and
easy
to
drink
at
that
rate
though
just
drink
water
its
nothing
fancy
or
worth
being
snobby
about
but
i
can
snag
a
4pack
of
tall
boys
for
less
than
3
us
and
itll
get
the
job
done
quick
keep
it
cold
though
it
tastes
a
lot
worse
warm
nattie
ice
is
a
hard
hitting
yet
smooth
beer
its
not
very
good
but
dang
it
it
gets
the
job
done
this
is
the
type
of
cheap
beer
i
buy
when
i
want
to
get
drunk
boom
5
9
and
18
years
old
that
is
all
wait
5
per
12pack
i
cracked
it
open
one
night
and
took
a
few
sips
i
didnt
really
taste
anything
well
there
might
have
been
some
grain
there
but
it
was
faint
it
was
not
pleasant
i
wanted
to
pour
it
all
out
but
you
know
what
im
gonna
be
honest
here
i
did
the
thing
that
i
think
most
normal
people
do
with
natty
ice
i
hammered
the
rest
of
it
home
and
got
a
nice
cheap
buzz
overall
this
isnt
half
bad
and
for
what
you
pay
for
it
its
better
than
a
lot
of
macros
out
there
i
really
thought
this
would
be
terrible
but
its
not
its
worth
a
shot
if
youre
broke
and
want
a
tasty
lager
for
the
night
still
doesnt
beat
high
life
but
pretty
close
possibly
the
most
efficiently
drunk
off
of
beer
you
can
get
its
not
very
good
but
at
least
its
cheap
as
hell
id
drink
this
over
bud
or
that
awful
pbr
garbage
8
days
a
week
if
you
want
a
good
beer
leave
this
alone
but
if
you
want
a
cheap
beer
that
gets
the
job
done
and
tastes
better
than
most
horrible
watery
lagers
then
grab
yourself
a
natty
ice
stay
away
from
natty
light
if
you
are
drinking
this
for
the
flavor
theres
something
seriously
wrong
with
you
glad
brews
like
this
exist
because
sometimes
you
are
just
trying
to
get
a
buzz
o
another
poor
aal
i
really
need
to
stop
reviewing
this
stuff
i
guess
the
lesson
is
is
that
somewhere
out
there
is
a
guy
that
this
beer
is
the
perfect
match
for
watery
and
flavorless
thats
how
he
likes
his
beers
it
does
its
job
i
may
be
an
considered
an
alcoholic
but
my
wife
and
i
drink
this
to
get
drunk
and
it
works
no
bad
taste
we
drink
right
out
of
the
can
and
it
is
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
im
not
a
beer
snob
like
some
on
here
so
if
youre
looking
to
get
drunk
for
cheap
this
is
the
beer
to
drink
we
dont
get
a
hangover
from
it
and
it
doesnt
hurt
my
wallet
overall
first
time
i
have
ever
tried
this
i
wasnt
expecting
much
so
was
surprised
that
it
was
not
offensive
at
all
definitely
want
to
drink
this
one
ice
cold
overall
this
gets
me
loaded
when
i
need
it
ive
had
the
younger
heady
topper
elder
zombie
dust
etc
etc
eat
a
hit
beer
snobs
sometimes
you
need
to
get
loaded
and
this
does
it
doesnt
taste
all
that
bad
either
if
spotting
bananas
are
your
thing
look
no
further
overall
its
beer
it
not
good
nor
is
it
bad
if
you
cant
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
youre
missing
the
point
of
beers
like
this
natty
ice
dominates
in
the
category
of
collegebingedrinking
30
racks
considering
it
is
a
hefty
5
9
for
shitty
beer
and
goes
down
like
water
not
heavy
not
tasteful
but
gets
the
job
done
at
a
price
point
of
like
20
or
less
for
30
cans
you
cant
really
go
wrong
for
the
college
budget
beats
out
bud
light
and
miller
for
bang
for
your
buck
nothing
special
here
i
go
to
college
so
i
drink
it
a
lot
its
obviously
not
winning
any
awards
but
it
gets
you
drunk
many
people
might
say
its
a
terrible
beer
but
its
better
than
some
other
beers
on
the
same
level
great
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
goes
down
like
water
equivalent
taste
cold
piss
its
a
good
beer
for
the
buck
only
5
40
a
six
pack
of
16
oz
cans
where
i
live
in
silverbay
mn
but
it
is
a
good
beer
for
a
cheap
beer
better
than
bush
an
has
a
good
color
an
flavor
if
your
not
realy
into
the
hoppy
beers
other
wise
its
head
goes
to
quick
other
than
that
its
a
good
beer
as
much
as
i
consider
myself
a
beer
aficionado
i
am
thankful
that
there
are
brews
like
natural
ice
no
you
wont
be
sipping
it
and
admiring
its
aroma
ha
no
instead
when
your
on
a
budget
and
you
want
30
cold
5
9
puppies
to
guzzle
and
get
an
admirable
buzz
this
brew
is
for
you
o
if
i
didnt
collect
40
ounce
bottles
as
part
of
my
breweriana
collection
i
probably
would
pass
on
this
this
is
a
cheap
beer
with
a
sole
purpose
of
introducing
alcohol
into
the
body
if
this
stuff
get
warm
over
about
40f
it
becomes
intolerable
so
dont
buy
a
big
container
unless
you
are
going
to
share
of
put
it
back
in
the
refrigerator
between
pours
where
can
it
be
found
so
cheap
this
isnt
much
for
me
as
it
is
for
my
stepfather
whos
disabled
and
likes
natural
ice
any
tips
or
tricks
on
cheaper
is
great
for
his
purpose
i
like
it
as
well
since
it
does
the
job
for
the
low
buck
vs
most
thanks
i
have
got
to
give
this
beer
a
3
5
out
of
5
its
not
the
best
beer
but
its
a
damn
good
beer
for
your
buck
13
99
before
taxes
for
a
30
pack
to
me
it
tastes
pretty
good
got
a
good
color
and
a
pleasing
smell
and
taste
for
your
typical
american
adjunct
lager
so
yeah
at
5
9
abv
ice
beer
i
would
roll
with
this
and
i
am
usually
a
icehouse
fan
i
have
to
say
when
i
first
drank
this
beer
it
tasted
great
i
think
it
has
been
downgraded
in
quality
and
now
tastes
not
so
good
once
was
good
now
sucks
i
think
that
batches
differ
considerably
compounded
by
freshness
variables
like
everything
else
it
gets
cheaped
out
after
initial
success
this
was
not
what
i
wanted
to
buy
but
the
store
did
not
have
what
i
wanted
so
i
figures
i
would
try
natty
ice
yes
i
would
say
its
worse
than
bud
light
and
thats
pretty
bad
you
cant
taste
any
alcohol
so
i
suppose
it
would
be
ok
for
chugging
but
i
like
to
have
a
nice
tasting
beer
not
water
beer
and
while
coors
or
miller
are
certainly
not
craft
beer
they
do
taste
like
beer
o
this
beer
is
certainly
much
better
served
ice
cold
it
definitely
does
not
get
better
as
it
comes
up
to
room
temperature
certainly
not
offensive
but
definitely
nothing
special
either
i
think
i
remember
this
beer
as
being
much
worse
from
my
college
days
this
was
another
one
that
i
feared
was
in
a
keg
at
any
college
party
i
went
to
it
is
light
amber
and
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
taste
the
taste
it
does
have
is
a
sweaty
taste
it
also
goes
down
pretty
rough
so
its
not
even
as
smooth
as
water
it
is
a
cheap
beer
so
how
much
can
you
expect
right
when
one
thinks
of
modern
day
socalled
ice
beers
images
of
frat
boys
beer
pong
and
toga
parties
likely
come
to
mind
surprisingly
this
beer
was
pretty
decent
and
not
much
different
from
premium
american
adjunct
lagers
if
you
are
hard
up
for
cash
and
looking
to
get
drunk
there
are
definitely
worse
options
out
there
oh
just
to
add
to
this
this
beer
maybe
substituted
by
icehouse
beer
at
anytime
for
the
same
effect
this
beer
was
not
too
good
but
heres
the
thing
if
youre
looking
for
cheap
beer
that
doesnt
go
down
bad
natural
ice
is
the
beer
for
you
i
feel
like
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
people
drink
more
for
the
effect
and
less
for
the
over
all
experience
for
me
its
5050
on
a
day
that
i
feel
like
cutting
lose
but
i
cant
really
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
for
a
long
time
this
beer
taste
malty
then
carbonated
not
a
strong
taste
but
balanced
best
beer
for
your
money
13
99
a
30
pack
here
im
satisfied
and
would
recommend
seems
like
the
flavor
has
changed
since
inbev
and
anhueser
merged
i
drink
this
in
the
can
clean
taste
no
metallic
taste
light
mouth
fill
and
light
taste
overall
this
brew
is
remarkably
flavorless
for
the
near
6
abv
the
carbonation
is
probably
much
to
blame
as
you
can
almost
feel
it
scrubbing
the
flavor
off
your
tongue
as
you
drink
it
overcarbonated
light
beer
type
of
feel
this
beer
is
horrible
tastes
like
battery
acid
i
had
this
and
a
miller
lite
side
by
side
the
miller
was
miles
better
than
this
this
is
the
worst
of
the
cheap
beers
and
one
can
also
assume
that
means
it
is
the
worst
beer
on
the
market
which
it
is
horrible
beer
which
only
is
sold
for
high
school
and
college
partys
rest
assured
though
this
beer
does
its
job
to
get
people
drunk
and
laid
overall
rather
average
adjunct
lager
nothing
to
offensive
but
nothing
too
great
it
gets
the
job
done
o
its
an
adjunct
lageryou
know
what
youre
getting
nothing
special
just
a
fizzy
beer
with
a
low
price
tag
and
a
decent
bang
in
the
alcohol
department
not
a
great
brew
but
sure
hits
the
spot
after
a
few
hours
of

a
good

quickly
established
i
really
think
that
for
the
money
you
can
not
find
a
better
beer
i
have
spent
over
30
for
a
12
pack
for
beer
before
and
was
not
impressed
natural
iceimpressed
ohhh
natural
ice
had
it
last
night
sigh
our
friend
got
the
wrong
stuff
the
first
one
wasnt
that
bad
then
the
2nd
and
3rd
were
just
terrible
i
couldnt
even
drink
it
it
tasted
like
skunked
beer
even
though
it
was
ice
cold
we
just
threw
the
remaining
dozen
away
cause
it
wasnt
tolerable
i
feel
for
anyone
who
has
to
consume
this
overall
drank
this
beer
ice
cold
it
will
not
taste
bad
i
would
choose
this
over
miller
high
life
bud
lite
and
coors
lite
if
i
was
on
budget
or
for
beer
pong
or
dranking
game
buy
it
for
cheap
beer
it
is
good
appearance
isnt
that
great
to
dark
for
a
pilsner
in
my
opinion
smell
is
averege
i
suppose
taste
isnt
that
great
very
metallic
smooth
but
i
have
to
force
it
down
mouthfeel
is
alright
i
suppose
but
overall
this
isnt
a
good
beer
even
for
the
price
i
would
take
icehouse
over
this
anyday
of
the
week
i
used
to
like
it
but
now
that
ive
had
a
variety
of
beers
i
think
this
one
is
rather
overated
poured
this
american
adjunct
lager
from
a
22
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
pale
straw
color
produced
an
average
head
retention
was
poor
and
it
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
clean
perhaps
some
malt
and
rice
light
in
body
this
lager
has
a
foundation
of
corn
and
rice
all
adjuncts
here
not
much
of
any
malt
flavor
to
speak
of
only
a
small
helping
of
hops
overall
a
poorly
made
beer
keep
your
1
25
and
put
a
down
payment
on
a
real
beer
eric
big
head
at
first
then
dies
quickly
very
nice
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
then
finishes
with
a
good
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
creeps
up
on
you
very
quickly
and
then
bam
you
are
on
your
ass
whoa
ate
pretzels
and
sardines
in
mustard
sauce
to
keep
the
buzz
in
check
finally
finished
with
2
more
and
went
to
bed
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
when
its
a
hot
day
out
its
refreshing
but
you
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
in
the
initial
few
sips
this
is
bad
pours
the
color
of
urine
after
an
evening
drinking
bcbs
smells
like
vodka
in
my
years
as
a
server
of
cheap
beer
i
served
enough
of
this
to
fill
the
building
that
youre
stitting
in
everytime
i
made
the
mistake
of
drinking
it
i
vomited
light
body
highly
carbonated
if
you
drink
it
pound
it
because
if
it
even
warms
up
a
little
bit
it
tastes
like
the
devils
taint
this
beer
is
probably
one
of
the
worse
beers
you
can
buy
very
dull
and
watered
down
taste
makes
it
a
unwanted
beer
in
my
opinion
if
you
are
looking
for
a
cheap
beer
there
are
better
choices
than
natural
ice
to
choose
the
can
is
unattractive
as
well
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
as
simple
as
its
name
this
is
what
you
are
looking
for
o
overall
it
tasted
like
an
extremely
cheap
malt
liquor
it
was
pretty
bad
overall
pretty
bad
overall
this
is
not
a
good
beer
ive
had
this
plenty
of
times
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
rated
it
it
was
actually
a
bit
better
than
i
remember
it
and
i
still
swear
by
natty
light
for
my
cheap
beer
the
ratings
however
didnt
come
out
to
well
even
when
considering
the
style
it
is
funny
that
i
used
to
think
that
ice
beers
were
so
strong
for
13
99
a
case
you
really
cant
find
anything
thats
actually
better
for
that
cheap
possibly
red
dog
but
i
dont
see
that
beer
in
stores
anymore
at
least
in
my
state
this
is
an
average
example
of
a
macro
lager
it
is
extremely
cheap
at
11
25
a
case
i
found
out
that
my
now
exgirlfriend
is
a
dirty
lying
bitch
and
i
am
really
poor
so
i
bought
a
case
of
this
the
other
night
i
was
forced
to
drink
garbage
it
got
me
drunk
didnt
take
away
any
of
my
problems
and
made
me
feel
like
hell
the
next
day
but
when
you
drink
all
but
a
handful
of
the
whole
case
in
one
sitting
any
beer
is
bound
to
do
that
to
you
for
the
price
natty
isnt
to
shabby
why
am
i
wasting
my
time
with
this
beer
im
not
in
college
anymore
i
have
a
job
i
have
a
real
job
where
i
make
real
money
and
i
have
a
fridge
full
of
decenttoexcellent
craft
beer
im
not
standing
in
front
of
a
table
of
strategically
placed
plastic
cups
and
there
are
no
greek
letters
anywhere
around
me
even
for
magro
lagers
being
14
for
a
30
can
case
and
it
continues
to
get
better
and
better
yes

really
just
a

lots

thin

not
much
of
a
taste
either
some
faint
malts
and
grains
no
hops
presesnt
just
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
well
this
beer
is
good
for
only
one
thing
and
that
is
to
get
drunk
cheap
no
real
big
flavor
very
easy
drinking
as
long
as
it
stays
cold
may
be
slightly
more
drinkable
than
its
light
counterpart
this
is
good
in
terms
of
both
abv
and
the
ability
to
slam
a
lot
this
is
usually
bought
for
large
parties
so
it
serves
its
purpose
quite
well
it
has
next
to
no
smell
only
alcohol
really
comes
through
more
flavor
probably
comes
from
the
carbonation
if
thats
possible
really
nothing
more
to

just
dont

about
it

this
poor
beer
has
been
beaten
up
so
by
so
many
other
reviewers
i
hate
to
ass
insult
to
injury
but
this
beer
deserves
a
1
well
it
deserves
a
zero
but
one
is
the
lowest
it
goes
and
1
does
have
awful
next
to
it
so
its
the
best
i
can
do
this
beer
has
a
taste
and
it
isnt
good
cheap
malt
and
hops
combine
for
a
distinct
and
regretable
trip
to
beer
hell
putred
comes
to
mind
horrable
also
but
in
the
words
of
dr
forrester
and
tvs
frank
its
bad
its
just
bad
why
drink
this
the
only
upside
to
this
is
that
your
not
paying
a
lot
for
your
bad
beer
like
paying
4
for
some
guy
to
beat
you
with
a
baseball
bat
it
sucked
but
at
least
it
was
cheap
looks
like
i
differ
from
the
collective
wisdom
of
the
ba
community
on
the
relative
merits
of
these
two
but
at
least
we
almost
all
agree
on
one
thing
bud
ice
and
natural
ice
are
both
bad
beer
taste
paper
and
corn
but
barely
any
of
either
this
tastes
a
heck
of
a
lot
less
offensive
than
some
premium
macros
because
it
doesnt
taste
much
at
all
kudos
to
ab
for
brewing
something
so
close
to
the
taste
of
nothingwater
and
having
5
9
alcohol
at
the
same
time
that
must
take
remarkable
skill
makes
me
wonder
if
natty
light
has
absolutely
no
taste
whatsoever
i
havent
had
a
natty
light
in
so
long
that
i
cant
remember
but
it
very
well
could
i
suppose
if
you
want
a
cheap
buzz
without
tasting
anything
you
should
drink
some
of
this
i
assure
you
that
your
taste
buds
wont
be
offended
overallnatty
ice
is
brewed
for
two
things
buying
cheap
and
getting
wasted
quick
in
this
role
it
is
very
good
as
it
is
a
smooth
ice
beer
that
is
light
on
your
wallet
on
the
ba
scale
one
cant
expect
it
to
go
high
though
as
it
is
not
a
beer
to
rave
about
drinking
save
this
for
the
night
out
with
the
frat
boys
and
not
for
your
next
home
party
the
beer
after
its
pour
from
the
12ounce
can
sets
in
the
glass
a
pale
gold
with
a
modest
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
a
film
of
lace
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
all
malt
fresh
and
crisp
start
somewhat
sweet
and
the
top
thin
finish
is
moderately
acidic
the
hops
light
and
the
aftertaste
dry
like
others
before
me
have
stated
the
smell
is
very
bad
the
unfortunate
thing
about
it
is
that
a
lot
of
natty
ice
drinkers
have
to
endure
the
smell
of
it
coming
back
up
the
taste
is
less
than
desirable
althogh
i
have
personally
had
much
much
worse
the
beer
is
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
you
can
drink
them
at
a
party
with
the
intention
of
being
drunk
i
wouldnt
recommend
sitting
down
to
enjoy
one
especially
with
a
meal
overall
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
beer
that
appeals
mainly
to
poor
college
students
looking
for
a
good
time
i
cant
help
but
notice
most
of
the
reviews
of
this
beer
that
are
favorable
are
done
by
members
with
less
than
10
reviews
anyhow
just
an
observation
pours
out
to
a
dead
head
with
little
carbonation
unique
smell
reminds
me
of
a
steel
plant
ie
lots
of
sulfer
the
only
high
point
of
the
beer
is
the
5
9
alcohol
content
i
would
recommend
most
anything
else
but
again
i
cant
say
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
id
rather
have
a
natty
light
try
it
if
you
dare
well

so
score
is

than
it
would
be
overall
ni
is
the
cheapest
of
the
beers
in

that

at

your
gonna

something
about
this
classic
college
beer
cheap
and
easy
gets
the
job
done
the
camo
can
was
pretty
cool
thats
all
i
got
my
least
favorite
beer
ever
budweisers
little

is
no
prince
it
is
however
cheap
and
you
get
what
you
pay
for
good
beer
for
mowing
the
yard
if
only
i
could
rate
it
1
one
of
my
goto
cheap
beers
for
when
one
wants
something
clean
with
very
little
taste
and
there
are
certainly
times
for
that
if
this
is
made
from
natural
ingredients
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
beer
brewing
process
its
all
that
snow
the
midwest
gets
plowed
up
melted
and
mixed
with
old
drums
of
schlitz
this
is
my
favorite
cheap
beer
but
notice
the
cheap
part
if
im
just
looking
to
grab
a
case
with
a
buddy
ad
drink
this
is
what
i
go
to
grainy
trashy
adjunct
lager
but
still
crisp
drinkable
this
is
a
pale
colored
lager
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
minimal
head
and
had
little
bite
or
a
strong
beer
taste
a
popular
dads
beer
from
the
7090s
and
still
popular
with
the
young
adults
on
a
fixed
budget
not
horrible
but
definitely
not
a
craft
beer
worthy
of
playing
beer
pong
but
not
for
drinking
if
this
beer
mimmicks
the
qualities
of
moutain
air
then
fuck
mountains
tastes
awful
serve
cold
so
you
cant
taste
what
do
you
really
expect
from
this
beer
ill
proudly
drink
it
any
day
even
over
a

of

it
is
what
it

going
to
buy
a
30
pack
for
15
at
walmart
now
looks
great
but
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
very
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
lace
of
head
that
recedes
to
about
nothing
smells
the
same
as
every
other
adjunct
lager
kinda
harsh
going
down
not
much
flavor
at
all
but
has
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
one
of
the
crappiest
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
this
is
incredibly
cheap
beer
bought
a
6
pack
just
because
i
wanted
beer
wasnt
really
expecting
much
i
dont
drink
normally
and
when
i
do
its
either
coors
extra
gold
or
coors
banquet
honestly
this
is
a
flavorful
cheap
beer
sometimes
i
come
home
after
a
long
days
work
i
dont
spend
a
ridiculous
amount
on
booze
of
any
sort
i
just
want
the
flavor
of
beer
sometimes
i
drank
this
after
a
long
10
hour
shift
of
physically
demanding
work
in
a
warehouse
walking
constantly
all
day
for
4
to
5
days
a
week
this
is
so
good
also
i
enjoy
these
with
fishing
i
admit
im
biased
as
this
was
my
first
beer
certainly
beats
budweiser
and
its
cheaper
i
never
have
had
anything
too
expensive
sam
adams
was
the
most
expensive
coming
home
on
night
shift
and
buying
this
and
drinking
one
ice
cold
it
seems
so
good
certainly
would
buy
this
over
bud
light
bought
this
drank
it
ice
cold
it
certainly
makes
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
15
bucks
for
a
30
pack
or
6
for
a
12
pack
you
cant
go
wrong
craft
brew
drinkers
should
probably
stay
away
because
they
like
better
taste
and
more
hops
but
for
a
guy
who
just
drinks
a
beer
for
refreshment
this
will
do
the
trick
better
than
bud
light
mainly
because
bud
light
is
more
expensive
and
doesnt
have
any
flavor
honestly
this
is
better
than
budweiser
cant
go
wrong
with
it
i
buy
one
every
night
after
work
put
in
the
freezer
for
a
bit
then
i
drink
it
and
it
is
just
a
delicious
refreshment
that
goes
down
smooth
crisp
and
clean
i
substitute
this
with
busch
light
or
coors
light
sometimes
dont
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
booze
because
im
saving
up
for
a
house
so
this
is
good
when
i
usually
buy
coors
light
this
beats
that
and
doesnt
have
the
metallic
taste
this
is
not
great
beer
it
is
sweet

not
sure
to
call
this
beer
or
beerflavored
water
a
very
very
mild
bitterness
cornmeal
theres
malts
in
this
i
couldnt
taste
any
for
some
reason
ive
always
thought
this
a
somewhat
better
beer
than
bud
though
thats
hardly
a
high
bar
still
as
you
would
expect
this
beer
is
very
light
and
watery
but
with
a
crisp
fairly
clean
finish
still
a
pretty
lousy
beer
but
decidedly
average
to
above
average
for
an
ab
product
extremely
pale
in
color
with
a
fleeting
head
and
minimal
head
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
is
dominated
by
adjuncts
with
some
grains
the
taste
is
extremely
light
and
the
moutfeel
quite
thin
with
essentially
no
finish
this
is
perhaps
a
great
beer
fishing
or
some
other
outdoor
activity
since
everything
tastes
better
outdoors
not
as
bad
as
some
would
have
you
believe
but
even
within
its
class
there
are
better
choices
i
wish
this
would
go
away
for
good
no
one
can
actually
like
this
taste
was
that
pee
or
beer
not
bad
best
thing
about
the
beer
is
the
head
for
the
mountains
commercial
not
the
worst
but
not
the
best
beer
on
the
market
decent
cheap
better
than
natural
ice
and
natural
light
overall
3
13
pounders
are
best
it
is
for
sure
a
crappy
trailer
beer
its
got
that
cheap
bottom
of
the
vat
character
and
skunk
flavor
with
all
that
being
said
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
pound
a
16
oz
can
easy
no
sweat
for
those
evenings
or
days
or
nights
i
feel
like
a
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
still
provides
some
marginal
flavor
busch
is
a
sure
ticket
good
for
absolutely
nothing
else
but
what
it
does
it
does
with
honor
i
do
not
recommend
that
beer
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
beer
except
that
i
would
recommend
it
for
a
party
situation
when
you
want
a
lot
of
beer
or
something
to
start
off
the
night
this
is
what
i
refer
to
as
lake
beer
or
as
my
father
says
lawnmower
beer
basically
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
spent
outdoors
if
you
worked
all
day
in
the
103
heat
sweating
tired
and
soar
and
say
someone
gave
you
and
ice
cold
can
of
busch
you
would
think
the
sweet
nectar
of
the
gods
was
being
poured
down
your
gullet
by
the
almighty
hand
of
zeus
himself
okay
maybe
im
embellishing
a
bit
the
taste
is
average
but
its
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
love
all
types
of
beers
even
a
2
can
of
busch
next
time
you
find
yourself
on
a
hot
day
get
a
cooler
full
of
these
and
you
might
hear
yourself
say
you
know
this
is
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
pale
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
some
very
minor
spotty
lacing
is
seen
as
is
the
norm
for
this
kind
of
beer
the
aroma
is
of
some
light
grains
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
and
is
watery
light
bodied
and
nothing
special
i
have
had
bad
beer
and
this
is
a
bad
beer
i
think
miller
high
life
brings
a
bit
more
to
the
table
had
while
at
a
family
barbecue
some
time
ago
the
only
beer
ive
been
too
disgusted
by
to
finish
also
gave
me
heartburn
and
terrible
beer
farts
there
are
better
sometimes
even
cheaper
things
out
there
to
drink
negative
10
out
of
5
recommended
only
for
those
with
burnt
palates
and
survival
experts
surnamed
grylls
kind
of
nostalgic
about
busch
because
i
drank
a
lot
of
it
in
college
and
somehow
developed
a
taste
for
it
youve
got
to
be
thirsty
to
appreciate
it
light
mouth
feel
and
rather
high
carbonation
make
it
a
good
beverage
beer
especially
refreshing
after
mowing
the
lawn
in
90degree
heat
or
with
picnic
food
outside
on
a
hot
day
almost
borders
on
being
a
lite
beer
kind
of
a
sour
aftertaste
but
not
that
bad
best
when
drunk
quickly
not
a
beer
to
be
nursed
by
the
connoisseur
somehow
i
prefer
it
to
bud
and
coors
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
one
of
the
most
drinkable
cheap
beers
12packs
are
sometimes
on
sale
for
6
95
at
the
local
rite
aid
cant
beat
that
a
good
beer
for
chugging
ice
cold
a
good
fishing
beer
not
as
good
as
rolling
rock
busch
bavarian
is
a
good
cheap
beer
to
reach
for
when
you
only
have
a
few
bucks
and
want
a
good
buzz
or
at
the
lake
flavor
again
a
mild
combination
of
corn
sweetness
sweet
barley
malt
and
some
grassiness
overall
not
offensive
and
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
range
o
unimpressive
there
are
better
versions
of
this
style
there
are
also
worse
ones
this
is
a
surprisingly
refreshing
beer
no
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
strong
flavor
and
it
does
go
down
easy
it
does
remind
me
of
a
mountain
stream
its
really
smooth
and
the
almost
over
carbonation
gives
it
a
little
extra
pop
thats
relaxing
i
like
it
better
than
big
sister
budweiser
sure
its
far
from
great
its
really
mediocre
and
a
decent
choice
if
youre
tight
on
money
its
also
not
bad
to
drink
all
day
while
fishing
its
a
cheap
beer
its
drinkable
cold
and
quickly
i
grew
up
seeing
the
busch
beer
commercials
and
never
really
drank
until
i
was
in
my
mid
twenties
fearing
that
it
would
be
a
bad
beer
i
was
really
surprised
how
easy
and
drinkable
bucsh
beer
is
and
the
lack
of
hangover
it
produced
it
pours
light
golden
with
average
carbonation
and
a
light
head
it
has
a
ricey
malty
taste
with
hints
of
wheat
and
sweetness
there
is
a
little
edge
with
an
average
aftertaste
and
it
is
not
very
filling
its
not
the
worst
beer
but
not
the
best
beer
either
good
for
when
your
working
out
in
the
hot
sun
or
cup
can
whatever
you
get
it
this
brew
is
light
and
refreshing
nothing
too
much
to
complain
about
but
it
is
rather
watery
a
decent
hot
weather
brew
the
watery
taste
can
be
a
bit
of
a
shock
if
youve
drank
something
heavier
beforehand
but
it
is
thirst
quenching
easy
to
drink
and
can
sneak
up
on
you
i
e
a
highly
efficient
alcohol
delivery
system
for
someone
who
can
really
chug
down
the
suds
this
beer
is
one
of
my
alternative
cheap
aals
especially
in
summer
something
to
grab
when
in
youre
in
a
small
town
without
much
selection
and
the
price
is
right
style
notes
the
standard
lager
can
have
little
to
no
malt
aroma
fast
fallihg
head
light
body
from
the
use
of
adjunct
and
dms
is
allowed
in
low
levels
the
dms
did
creep
on
to
the
palate
in
sufficient
amounts
to
keep
from
wanting
another
one
of
these
but
the
green
apple
sweetness
was
less
than
some
other
beers
like
molson
canadian
an
d
even
heineken
so
i
teetered
between
2
75
and
3
0
for
a
taste
rating
i
gave
it
the
lower
rating
because
i
do
nto
want
another
overallnot
all
bad
not
very
flavorful
but
that
arguably
can
be
an
advantage
of
the
beer
overall
easy
to
drink
void
of
flavor
and
taste
just
smells
bad
enjoy
cant
go
wrong
with
busch
an
american
adjunct
lager
brewed
here
in
canada
on
license
by
labatts
accepted
a
generous
offer
of
a
can
figuring
what
the
heck
i
havent
tried
this
one
and
frankly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
why
not
capitalize
perhaps
the
most
translucent
beer
i
have
yet
to
see
almost
clear
with
just
the
barest
hint
of
pale
straw
tint
massively
overcarbonated
as
would
be
expected
standard
fizzy
soda
water
approach
to
imbibing
alcohol
that
caters
to
mainstream
palates
hey
it
is
what
it
is
its
an
affront
to
good
beer
but
we
still
live
in
a
world
where
a
preference
for
mediocrity
and
playing
it
safe
drive
peoples
decisions
for
what
its
worth
this
beer
tastes
like
corn
some
stale
grainy
malt
maybe
a
little
shortbread
sweetness
some
green
grass
but
its
all
buried
under
bubbles
and
this
brew
is
outstanding
in
its
major
lack
of
conspicuous
flavors
the
longer
brewing
process
seems
to
have
napalmed
all
the
flavor
along
with
the
dreaded
calories
i
have
had
adjunct
lagers
where
you
can
at
least
taste
said
adjuncts
i
did
taste
more
sweetness
and
cooked
flavors
as
it
warmed
up
but
alas
heres
where
the
cardboard
and
plastic
cutlery
notes
also
emerge
crisp
clean
finish
is
an
asset
i
suppose
although
here
some
grainy
alcohol
still
crashes
the
party
really
quite
fucking
awful
but
the
sweet
aint
so
sweet
without
the
sour
yes
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
aal
overall
35
or
60100
is
okay
and
thats
how
id
rate
this
beer
it
tastes
of
cheap
beer
mixed
it
with
carbonated
water
and
called
it
alcoholic
it
tastes
like
a
light
beer
with
all
the
calories
of
regular
i
would
probably
have
to
drink
6
to
feel
it
and
actually
enjoy
it
all
in
all
what
did
i
expect
from
anheiser
buschsdbp123oct
20
tastes
the
same
as
all
the
other
macros
nothing
to
see
here
o
overall
this
is
a
very
malty
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
way
better
tasting
big
flats
1901
and
a
light
malt
liquor
its
good
carry
on
citizens
busch
light
is
everywhere
but
busch
i
hadnt
seen
it
at
least
for
a
long
time
if
ever
so
i
was
curious
to
try
it
bland
is
the
operative
word
here
typical
pale
american
lager
plenty
of
carbonation
but
not
too
much
little
or
no
aroma
flavor
starts
as
completely
neutralneuter
with
a
hint
of
nothingness
a
slight
malt
flavor
begins
to
kick
in
it
is
a
pleasant
pale
malt
flavor
without
a
hint
of
any
toasted
quality
i
wish
there
was
more
of
it
this
flavor
fades
quickly
to
more
neutral
hints
of
nothingness
in
the
finish
best
consumed
very
cold
on
a
hot
day
after
strenuous
physical
exertion
i
have
to
say
not
too
bad
for
the
style
one
of
the
better
american
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
and
much
better
than
what
i
remember
from
when
i
was
drinking
this
in
high
school
and
college
d
piss
water
is
not
a
term
i
use
to
describe
many
beers
but
it
fits
this
one
perfectly
while
it
had
no
distinctly
offensive
qualities
i
found
its
complete
lack
of
character
offensive
i
guess
when
i
review
a
beer
im
reviewing
it
on
what
kind
of
beer
it
is
example
this
is
busch
its
cheap
im
not
going
to
give
it
a
1
or
2
since
im
rating
it
while
comparing
it
to
cheap
beers
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
has
a
decent
taste
and
isnt
all
that
filling
if
im
looking
for
a
relaxing
night
and
im
counting
my
pennies
busch
will
always
be
considered
nice
beer
great
price
overall
honestly
tastes
like
a
lot
of
other
american
adjunct
lagers
this
beer
brings
back
a
lot
of
memories
for
me
growing
up
in
the
woods
woods
that
happen
to
be
in
the
american
south
im
not
sure
if
it
is
the
fulfillment
of
a
stereotype
or
simply
mere
happenstance
that
i
was
drinking
busch
beer
at
many
of
the
quintessential
moments
in
my
young
life
including
the
moment
my
buicks
rear
window
was
shot
out
at
a
party
in
the
ocala
national
forest
however
in
retrospect
i
can
tell
you
that
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
busch
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
and
objectively
a
higher
rating
than
trash
like
natty
and
miller
light
as
others
have
stated
it
definitely
gives
you
less
of
a
hangover
as
long
as
you
stay
under
the
twelvepackinonenight
limit
there
is
a
reason
that
there
is
a
busch
beer
and
not
an
anheiser
beer
somewhere
along
the
line
inbev
must
have
realized
that
when
it
comes
to
cheap
beer
people
prefer
short
names
and
complex
connotations
its
almost
poetic
when
you
think
about
it
go
to
the
mountains
with
busch
reminds
me
of
junior
and
senior
year
of
high
school
with
my
friends
well
and
now
still
with
those
same
friends
o
not
an
offensive
taste
overall
could
see
this
as
something
you
could
down
a
few
of
easily
with
drinking
games
or
on
a
warm
summer
day
mowing
the
lawn
not
the
best
of
its
type
and
there
are
better
beers
in
the
price
range
busch
beer
to
me
is
probably
one
of
the
more
average
beers
ive
had
theres
really
nothing
that
truly
stands
out
nor
offends
not
to
say
its
a
really
bad
beer
just
more
forgettable
but
at
4
99
for
a
6pack
of
12oz
cans
you
cant
go
wrong
in
this
case
appearance
wise
it
looks
like
a
pale
lager
when
poured
into
my
beerfest
replica
36oz
boot
very
similar
to
other
beers
like
rolling
rock
budweiser
pbr
etc
smellwise
its
rather
weak
slight
bit
of
barley
but
not
too
much
going
on
tastewise
its
rather
smooth
and
watery
almost
like
a
light
beer
but
more
ballsy
and
between
you
and
i
it
goes
down
easy
while
not
provoking
a
hangover
the
next
day
like
many
other
cheap
beers
overall
its
a
good
goto
beer
for
budget
minded
folks
looking
for
a
smooth
inoffensive
beer
in
most
cases
you
will
get
more
than
your
moneys
worth
picked
up
4
24
oz
cans
and
split
it
with
my
brother
a
couple
days
ago
appearance
looks
like
a
fine
bright
golden
pilsner
the
smell
is
decent
taste
is
where
it
gets
good
though
its
defiantly
refreshing
maybe
a
little
watery
for
some
of
the
europeans
beer
drinkers
but
it
is
very
nice
its
a
beer
you
can
pound
back
one
after
another
light
amount
of
hops
present
defiantly
corn
or
rice
in
it
too
though
probably
more
rice
than
anything
good
tasting
they
defiantly
use
good
water
in
making
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
decent
the
carbonation
isnt
that
bad
at
all
and
overall
i
would
say
this
is
one
damn
fine
beer
if
you
like
beer
most
likely
you
will
like
this
it
may
not
be
a
craft
beer
but
its
a
working
mans
beer
its
a
beer
you
would
want
when
your
fishing
or
hiking
or
when
you
get
home
from
a
grueling
day
of
work
or
when
your
watching
a
sports
game
i
mean
who
would
want
a
rich
mans
beer
for
that
im
very
content
with
busch
and
will
definitely
buy
again
ive
had
a
lot
of
beers
overall
i
would
say
this
was
the
worst
i
have
tasted
ive
talked
to
plenty
of
people
who
say
the
like
the
beer
but
i
just
dont
see
it
wayyyy
better
options
out
there
if
ur
looking
for
cheap
beer
final
grade
2
34
a
regrettable
d
busch
is
alright
by
light
beer
standards
a
low
bar
i
grant
you
but
its
just
too
bland
and
watery
to
deserve
credit
as
anything
more
than
that
sorry
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
anything
and
one
of
the
things
i
look
for
in
my
beers
is
flavour
yes
even
the
adjunct
lagers
if
you
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
then
i
guess
you
could
consider
switching
from
budcoors
light
to
this
and
maybe
save
a
few
bucks
easy
to
drink
en
masse
but
there
isnt
a
beer
drinker
alive
who
couldnt
find
something
better
even
for
inebriative
purposes
o
i
gave
it
some
style
points
because
lets
face
it
its
one
of
the
cheapest
beers
available
no
one
is
buying
busch
because
they
are
a
beer
connoisseur
its
light
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
you
can
take
it
fishing
you
can
enjoy
it
by
the
pool
you
can
enjoy
more
than
one
of
them
at
a
social
event
take
it
for
what
it
is
dont
hate
it
for
what
it
isnt
thanks
to
buschbeer
for
his
signature
calling
card
can
the
only
way
to
buy
this
is
in
30
packs
its
light
and
straw
colored
this
being
the
first
one
i
have
ever
poured
into
a
glass
taste
is
light
and
grain
i
realize
why
i
buy
this
easy
to
drink
and
ready
when
you
want
to
drink
several
and
then
maybe
a
couple
more
oif
youre
expecting
this
to
be
a
world
class
beer
you
need
to
get
out
more
its
a
beer
you
can
drink
all
day
and
night
while
im
a
huge
fan
of
dark
heavy
strong
beers
i
always
have
me
some
busch
on
hand
i
really
was
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
the
first
time
i
tried
it
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
tried
the
taste
was
not
one
of
a
good
beer
with
very
little
hops
while
it
may
not
have
much
taste
it
seems
to
have
a
little
higher
alcohol
content
thanother
beers
i
know
this
is
a
cheap
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
even
that
good
cold
busch
is
perfect
for
a
barbeque
or
cookout
this
is
session
beer
this
is
not
high
class
or
high
hops
busch
is
what
your
grandfather
drank
after
mowing
the
yard
pale
straw
small
and
poorly
retained
white
head
mild
beery
aroma
like
carbonated
water
lightly
infused
with
corn
cereal
mildly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
green
apple
lightbodied
and
highly
carbonated
feels
thin
and
spritzy
in
the
mouth
like
perrier
i
doubt
i
could
easily
distinguish
this
from
its
beechwoodaged
sister
budweiser
or
from
most
other
beers
of
this
type
if
tasted
blind
has
that
green
character
common
to
many
aals
flavor
is
light
im
getting
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
a
little
corn
just
a
slight
hint
of
grass
bitterness
is
very
minimum
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
body
is
light
and
watery
fizzy
carbonation
easy
drinking
years
ago
there
was
this
beer
called
busch
bavarian
we
in
new
york
couldnt
find
it
as
i
recall
it
was
only
available
in
the
new
england
states
it
was
pretty
good
but
so
was
coors
at
the
time
i
grabbed
this
clear
and
bright
as
mountain
air
limited
edition
24
oz
can
thinking
it
might
be
like
the
above
mentioned
wrong
can
you
say
bland
and
tasteless
beers
like
this
make
me
appreciate
the
good
beers
all
the
more
this
has
very
little
taste
and
what
taste
it
does
have
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
no
wonder
craft
beers
are
so
popular
another
nothing
beer
overall
generic
lager
from
the
mega
conglomerate
still
it
is
ok
for
what
it
is
you
could
do
worse
overall
while
for
a
cheaper
brew
it
is
not
really
the
most
flavorful
or
smooth
out
there
not
offensive
but
pretty
bland
possibly
good
for
a
cheaper
session
as
it
is
easy
to
down
lighter
in
abv
and
subtle
in
taste
from
a
glass
this
is
foul
metallic
sweet
grainy
gross
from
a
can
when
ice
cold
its
incredible
drinkable
cheap
as
dirt
too
i
wouldnt
have
reviewed
this
is
someone
hadnt
left
it
in
my
fridge
i
cant
see
me
having
this
again
this
beer
looks
ok
and
smells
pretty
bad
the
taste
which
taste
it
tastes
like
water
and
thats
definetly
what
i
dont
want
when
i
drink
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
too
carbonated
well
you
pay
for
a
budget
beer
well
thats
what
you
get
but
i
think
it
is
brewed
to
be
it
for
what
it
is
this
beer
isnt
bad
cheap
and
heavier
on
the
alcohol
than
its
light
brethren
slightly
less
adjuncty
and
a
little
more
malty
pale
straw
yellow
in
the
glass
big
head
with
no
retention
or
lacing
smell
is
mainly
corny
but
a
little
bit
of
heavier
malts
taste
is
the
same
drink
it
when
youre
poor
and
want
to
get
drunk
or
a
great
beer
after
being
outside
in
the
heat
all
day
first
off
my
group
of
friends
drinks
way
too
much
shitty
beer
so
this
review
is
mostly
in
comparison
to
other
shitty
beers
purchased
a
30
pack
for
a
party
we
usually
buy
keystone
or
miller
high
life
busch
has
a
bit
more
taste
than
coors
or
keystone
and
doesnt
give
me
a
headache
once
i
drink
14
of
them
like
keystone
will
they
are
easy
to
shot
gun
and
i
really
dont
mind
the
taste
especially
compared
to
the
metallic
flavor
of
miller
my
uncle
always
drank
busch
in
front
of
me
and
when
i
was
a
teenager
he
would
give
me
one
sometimes
and
reefered
them
alaskan
sodas
il
admit
its
a
little
bit
like
drinking
urine
but
they
go
down
easy
and
it
gives
you
something
to
do
in
the
form
of
drinking
and
peeing
all
night
long
instead
of
getting
too
fucked
off
the
bat
its
also
nice
to
take
a
couple
tequila
shots
and
then
get
to
fine
tuning
your
drunk
and
eventually
passing
out
puking
and
you
dont
look
like
as
much
of
a
pussy
drinking
busch
as
you
would
rolling
rock
but
im
rambling
and
busch
is
goood
i
miss
brett
poured
this
adjunct
lager
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
straw
color
and
produced
a
decent
head
poor
retention
and
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
somewhat
skunky
fermented
grain
light
in
body
this
lager
has
a
very
watery
and
thin
mouthfeel
sweet
cooked
corn
some
slight
hop
flavor
and
mild
bitterness
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
even
for
the
standard
of
american
adjunct
lager
poured
into
a
clean
soapfree
pint
glass
foamy
1
inch
head
that
falls
to
a
18
layer
with
small
bits
of
foam
clinging
to
the
glass
could
hardly
call
it
lace
aroma
is
co2
and
cooked
corn
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
there
are
other
beers
for
the
price
that
have
more
flavor
in
terms
of
both
malt
and
hops
this
is
a
faint
corn
adjunct
and
seltzer
flavor
with
a
dry
and
veggie
finish
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
cheap
3
2
beer
watery
and
flat
overall
this
beer
is
not
terrible
tasting
it
just
tastes
like
beer
made
for
people
who
do
not
like
beer
o
for
a
macro
its
not
bad
i
personally
like
high
life
but
i
would
put
this
a
slight
notch
above
that
i
havent
had
regular
bud
in
a
while
so
hard
to
say
if
its
better
than
that
but
good
for
cookouts
and
enjoying
after
working
in
the
yard
or
something
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
commercial
beers
its
very
light
and
very
drinkable
the
main
difference
between
this
and
budweiser
is
busch
is
made
with
corn
and
not
rice
makes
it
a
bit
heavier
than
budweiser
yet
still
a
very
light
pale
lager
taste
is
light
a
bit
of
citrus
but
mostly
corn
pale
pale
pale
yellow
in
color
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
something
with
a
heavy
taste
like
pizza
or
hotdogs
something
that
beer
goes
good
with
but
something
you
dont
really
want
to
waste
a
great
beer
on
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
bubbly
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
scent
is
mild
with
wheat
and
some
slight
citrus
hints
taste
is
weak
thin
and
grainy
this
one
of
those
beers
that
i
call
beer
flavored
water
on
a
hot
summer
day
im
sure
youll
be
thankful
to
have
a
busch
if
you
are
out
of
every
other
form
of
liquids
but
thats
about
it
not
even
a
good
cheap
beer
for
the
same
price
you
can
get
pabst
that
actually
has
some
flavor
to
it
now
try
to
imagine
there
is
a
busch
light
blah
i
might
be
the
only
one
on
this
site
to
say
so
but
a
camo
can
makes
this
beer
taste
better
than
it
is
overall
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
this
is
a
cheap
beer
but
their
marketing
dollars
work
on
this
hunter
oh
well
sometimes
it
is
nice
to
enjoy
a
low
end
beer
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
really
bad
beer
if
you
havent
try
the
camo
can
if
you
are
in
a
mood
for
a
nonaggressive
beer
this
is
a
good
value
play
o
busch
ice
is
the
best
representation
of
the
busch
brand
busch
is
ok
definitely
better
than
busch
light
i
dont
know
why
they
even
bother
to
make
busch
light
when
busch
has
an
abv
of
only
4
6
you
arent
going
to
catch
a
buzz
off
of
this
one
which
is
another
reason
to
go
for
the
ice
version
at
the
same
price
this
beer
serves
as
a
pretty
good
palate
cleanser
and
goes
good
with
nonfancy
food
bbq
wings
at
14
99
for
a
30
pack
things
could
be
worse
o
overall
this
is
what
it
is
slightly
below
standard
for
my
liking
easy
drinking
macro
i
cant
really
say
anything
bad
about
busch
its
very
smooth
for
the
price
tastes
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
and
is
cheap
what
else
could
you
possibly
want
for
a
party
a
pbr
slightly
beats
it
in
the
taste
category
but
it
matches
virtually
everywhere
else
a
much
better
choice
than
natty
or
milwaukees
only
real
complaint
is
that
it
didnt
get
me
drunk
as
quickly
as
i
had
hoped
this
is
how
ok
smelled
offensive
yea
it
was
pale
yellow
and
had
no
head
but
we
all
knew
that
before
i
opened
the
can
it
was
like
this
jumbled
mess
of
watered
down
caramel
dirt
mud
and
pond
water
i
just
cant
get
past
it
i
mean
its
the
first
beer
that
i
can
honestly
say
i
hated
and
wouldnt
touch
again
poured
from
the
newold
labeled
bottle
into
pint
glass
looks
like
water
i
have
never
poured
a
beer
this
light
good
lord
tons
of
carbonation
small
head
that
falls
fast
smells
like
carbonated
water
i
honestly
dont
think
they
put
any
barley
or
hops
in
this
one
just
rice
and
water
maybe
a
hint
of
yeast
tastes
like
water
flavored
with
corn
very
carbonated
extremely
thin
and
light
just
like
the
color
shows
this
isnt
god
awful
but
this
isnt
anything
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
here
maybe
wouldnt
mind
having
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
mowing
the
lawn
but
i
could
find
something
better
for
the
occasion
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
price
tag
4
99
a
sixer
this
was
my
dads
beer
of
choice
when
i
was
a
kid
so
i
might
be
a
little
biased
but
i
think
it
tastes
a
bit
better
than
abs
other
more
popular
offering
aromas
of
cereal
and
fruit
and
similar
flavors
with
some
subtle
citrus
hop
bitterness
not
my
favorite
macro
lager
but
id
take
it
over
most
others
overall
like
a
macro
beer
was
frozen
and
then
thawed
lacks
most
of
anything
i
like
most
of
abs
products
but
this
is
just
flat
out
not
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
if
youre
looking
for
beer
with
a
mild
flavor
however
this
is
the
place
to
go
this
is
a
thirst
quenching
bland
beer
its
easy
to
drink
but
very
boring
well
this
one
wasnt
too
good
at
all
very
tasteless
and
kind
of
like
drinking
carbonated
water
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
typical
of
the
style
coming
from
a
macro
brewery
a
lot
is
sacrificed
by
using
the
less
expensive
ingredients
were
i
tasting
this
blind
i
would
think
that
this
is
a
light
beer
o
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
are
in
university
and
hosting
a
party
and
want
to
have
a
fridge
full
of
beer
in
fact
when
i
was
in
university
we
used
to
dink
bush
because
it
was
there
thank
god
i
got
older
and
came
to
my
grew
a
pallet
cheap
nasty
beer
should
be
avoided
ive
certainly
had
more
than
my
fair
share
of
busch
and
id
probably
drink
it
again
its
cheap
and
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
compared
to
others
of
the
style
its
actually
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
and
theres
nothing
to
really
dislike
about
it
overall
drink
only
to
get
sloshed
this
has
no
flavor
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
for
the
price
good
for
college
kids
who
leave
half
full
cans
all
over
the
place
ticked
this
fine
product
on
new
years
eve
pours
incredibly
pale
yellow
with
a
short
lived
white
head
smells
strongly
of
corn
and
corn
syrup
with
a
touch
of
metal
maybe
some
notes
of
green
apple
and
straw
decently
sweet
in
terms
of
the
flavor
with
quite
a
bit
of
corn
to
it
a
touch
watery
with
some
of
the
same
apple
and
straw
notes
not
overly
offensive
but
not
very
good
either
i
like
busch
im
goin
to
get
some
busch
these
are
unfortunately
the
best
things
about
talking
about
drinking
busch
i
guess
its
satisfying
on
some
level
because
the
stuff
isnt
vomit
inducing
and
well
you
get
to
say
some
suggestive
things
while
drinking
alcohol
good
for
you
this
used
to
be
my
goto
beer
before
a
world
of
possibilities
was
opened
to
me
in
the
form
of
craft
beer
mainly
due
to
the
price
its
pretty
offputting
now
of
course
but
you
could
do
worse
had
this
on
tap
in
the
sticks
of
colorado
lochbuie
just
as
nasty
as
the
stuff
in
the
can
or
the
bottle
i
have
had
both
before
and
thought
the
tap
might
be
a
little
better
but
was
proved
dead
wrong
plus
i
think
the
keg
was
old
and
the
lines
were
not
cleaned
well
the
can
was
better
and
that
says
it
all
right
there
i
just
saw
this
beer
at
7
50
for
a
20
pack
in
allenstownnh
i
bought
the
brooklyn
lager
for
8
99
a
six
pack
there
must
be
a
minimum
qualification
for
a
drink
that
is
considered
beer
busch
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
certainly
does
not
qualify
o
i
dont
want
to
rag
on
this
beer
for
simply
being
a
style
that
i
generally
try
to
avoid
but
i
agree
with
jason
here
this
really
is
crap
beer
that
is
good
to
have
once
in
a
while
just
to
remind
yourself
that
there
are
better
beers
out
there
overall
not
good
i
mean
a
lot
of
the
adjunct
beers
taste
similar
so
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
but
this
one
has
a
bit
of
a
odd
cooked
vegetable
type
taste
to
it
that
i
really
didnt
enjoy
it
didnt
even
do
the
job
of
being
a
refreshing
after
hockey
beer
which
is
what
i
expect
from
adjuncts
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
served
on
tap
at
seaworld
orlando
thank
god
i
didnt
have
to
buy
it
to
try
it
it
has
the
color
of
slightly
yellow
water
it
smells
like
sweet
corn
water
it
tastes
like
sweet
corn
water
and
only
the
mildest
hint
it
may
have
ever
been
near
barley
another
fine
abinbev
product
oh
boy
i
cant
wait
to
drink
11
more
of
these
shits
o
okay
so
this
is
a
shit
beer
we
all
know
that
i
find
new
empties
of
this
along
with
lots
of
coors
light
littering
the
road
i
live
on
daily
this
beer
is
what
it
is
and
it
is
drank
by
a
certain
class
of
people
for
the
most
part
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
long
time
and
i
can
say
it
was
worse
and
more
bland
than
i
ever
remembered
o
not
good
at
all
if
this
is
the
only
drink
available
at
a
party
take
your
chances
just
drank
this
for
the
first
time
im
an
all
micro
guy
and
i
know
busch
is
a
terrible
beer
just
by
reputation
but
i
bought
some
to
see
what
it
tastes
like
and
you
know
what
it
tastes
like
water
it
doesnt
even
resemble
the
taste
of
a
beer
its
barely
refreshing
extremely
drinkable
but
thats
it
smooth
as
its
name
are
you
kidding
me
its
water
plain
and
simple
during
my
time
at
central
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
a
lot
of
adjunct
lagers
and
this
might
be
one
of
the
worst
it
has
the
color
of
slightly
yellow
water
it
smells
like
sweet
corn
water
it
tastes
like
sweet
corn
water
while
there
are
good
adjunct
lagers
this
is
not
one
of
them
smells
vaguely
of
wet
cardboard
and
cooked
vegetables
dms
some
mild
apple
sweetness
when
swirled
around
tastes
like
cardboard
or
wet
paper
apple
juice
cooked
veggies
again
mealy
tacky
envelope
glue
texture
fizzy
and
overcarbonated
chugged
the
last
bit
as
there
was
no
sink
available
at
the
party
rip
hard
boiled
records
thanks
for
the
beer
and
memories
mark
when
i
poured
this
beer
in
late
afternoon
light
it
literally
looked
like
fizzy
water
with
froth
the
nose
is
fairly
nonexistent
consisting
of
only
the
faintest
beeriness
and
a
modicum
of
alcohol
adjunct
sweetness
is
mildly
perceptible
in
the
flavor
but
it
is
quite
flavorless
overall
even
for
the
style
the
feel
is
prickly
busch
is
not
very
impressive
and
seems
to
be
clearly
lesser
than
a
number
of
other
widely
available
aals
head
vanishes
quickly
leaving
not
much
to
see
smell
or
taste
o
i
bought
this
beer
on
a
tip
that
it
was
identical
to
other
american
macros
at
a
substantial
discount
pbrs
even
cheaper
and
much
better
though
if
for
some
reason
youre
looking
to
buy
an
american
macro
theres
no
good
reason
to
pick
this
up
overal
drinkability
watery
with
no
body
for
getting
drunk
on
the
cheap
without
tasting
anything
resembling
alcohol
great
for
what
its
purpose
is
otherwise
boring
and
not
worth
while
i
probably
just
described
90
of
aals
keep
in
mind
im
rating
to
style
this
time
my
last
busch
review
in
bottle
was
rated
more
towards
beer
in
general
very
nonoffensive
beer
feels
like
drinking
a
bud
light
but
with
a
bit
more
charactor
this
is
as
close
to
a
light
beer
as
i
try
to
go
when
ice
cold
this
is
a
great
lawnmower
beer
or
at
a
bbq
with
a
bunch
of
beer
moochers
this
is
the
beer
that
you
drink
when
you
want
some
alcohol
with
your
water
its
cheap
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
this
is
a
beer
that
can
carry
you
all
day
while
your
sitting
on
your
porch
or
out
fishing
if
they
did
a
taste
test
with
bottled
water
and
this
you
might
think
busch
is
tap
water
really
though
this
is
another
solid
cheap
easy
drinking
beer
that
will
enable
you
to
cruise
a
buzz
all
day
overall
this
was
not
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
not
want
to
have
another
i
enjoyed
the
lighter
version
more
this
beer
is
golden
clear
and
has
much
carbonation
the
taste
and
smeel
are
dominated
by
grain
and
barley
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
you
can
drink
alot
of
this
with
no
issues
i
remember
the
busch
and
busch
light
commercials
where
the
hand
grabs
a
six
pack
of
cans
out
of
the
icy
stream
bbbbuuussscccchhhh
clean
and
smooth
good
beer
for
the
price
cold
is
key
cold
is
key
bought
at
meijer
for
13
69
a
30
pack
i
like
this
beer
with
pretzels
andor
sardines
yummy
stuff
for
a
basic
beer
the
hint
of
hops
and
barley
were
very
evident
and
the
carbonation
was
constant
from
first
sip
to
last
d
easy
enough
to
drink
i
only
had
this
to
review
bc
a
buddy
brought
it
over
to
watch
the
hockey
game
so
it
did
its
job
wont
go
looking
for
this
again
as
there
are
better
aals
out
there
this
one
is
good
when
youre
done
sneezing
uncontrollably
after
cutting
the
lawn
for
the
first
time
in
the
spring
and
need
something
to
wet
your
throat
again
if
you
drink
this
expecting
to
taste
the
worst
thing
youve
ever
drank
you
might
enjoy
it
taste
notes
carbonated
water
and
very
mild
cheap
beer
taste
with
practically
no
finish
and
very
little
aftertaste
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
light
version
yellow
pale
minimal
aromas
no
head
after
the
pour
boring
mostly
corn
and
very
light
barley
taste
and
smell
its
hard
to
even
rate
this
because
i
dont
know
what
else
i
can
say
i
really
dont
plan
on
having
this
brew
again
i
can
barely
drink
this
and
if
given
the
choice
i
will
generally
choose
water
this
beer
has
a
very
unmistakable
corny
effervescence
that
does
not
belong
in
my
beer
at
all
this
beer
is
somewhat
chuggable
although
its
not
something
that
my
stomach
holds
well
i
will
take
high
life
pbr
gansett
and
maybe
even
a
few
others
before
i
go
in
on
this
beer
heck
i
will
even
take
busch
light
before
this
i
actually
got
a
very
thick
head
out
of
this
then
again
these
macros
seem
to
produce
fatter
heads
than
most
beers
very
faint
but
still
golden
yellow
straw
coloring
i
can
actually
smell
it
pretty
potent
for
an
adjunct
lager
very
sweet
malty
cereal
and
corn
faint
hops
also
present
has
a
taint
of
noble
pils
standard
lager
nose
but
it
is
prominent
taste
is
pretty
weak
and
watery
tastes
like
carbonated
water
with
a
dash
of
splenda
mouthfeel
is
not
overly
carbonated
but
a
bit
thin
and
even
though
i
like
oily
in
my
ipas
it
doesnt
fit
well
here
it
isnt
hard
to
get
down
but
the
carbonation
and
tartness
i
am
getting
now
takes
drinkability
down
a
notch
i
wanted
to
try
and
review
one
of
these
with
style
in
mind
i
did
struggle
with
the
taste
a
bit
budweiser
and
coors
are
leaps
and
bounds
better
with
taste
decent
beer
isnt
hard
and
can
be
cheap
this
beer
is
an
affront
to
sensibilities
d
it
is
actually
not
too
hard
to
drink
but
that
is
just
because
its
so
watery
and
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
its
kind
of
like
carbonated
beer
water
i
could
easily
drink
a
12pack
of
this
but
i
really
would
not
want
too
i
definitely
do
not
recommend
d
moderate
cold
its
drinkable
and
its
not
bad
its
not
one
id
care
to
revisit
but
ive
had
far
worse
am
adjuncts
better
than
i
expected
my
most
hated
beer
of
all
time
i
dont
know
what
they
do
to
this
beer
but
it
is
god
awful
flavor
is
gut
wrenching
full
of
rice
or
corn
not
sure
which
no
hops
or
malts
to
speak
of
of
course
no
head
or
lacing
just
a
horrible
horrible
beer
i
will
avoid
this
one
at
all
costs
d
drink
it
cold
and
fast
and
try
not
to
taste
it
d
the
flavor
isnt
as
bad
as
some
mass
produced
beers
as
long
as
it
is
nice
and
cold
easy
too
drink
but
once
it
starts
to
warm
it
is
awful
so
drink
fast
done
of
the
rare
cases
when
less
taste
is
a
plus
smooth
and
drinkable
if
cold
enough
good
bang
for
your
buck
if
quantity
is
more
important
than
quality
well
the
pour
from
the
can
resulted
in
a
one
finger
foam
head
with
little
lasting
power
the
lace
was
not
far
behind
but
had
a
good
pattern
color
was
a
3
on
the
srm
chart
not
good
for
a
nonlight
beer
smell
oooo
i
am
in
a
corn
field
and
the
corn
is
gone
i
smell
husks
and
rice
flavor
corn
rice
little
malt
water
in
my
mouth
less
than
yard
work
beer
this
is
a
beer
you
serve
after
all
the
low
priced
beer
runs
out
sorry
that
is
how
i
feel
d
well
an
extra
5
here
for
the
fact
that
its
50cents
a
can
its
really
bad
but
in
all
honesty
the
more
of
this
you
drink
the
more
you
forget
how
bad
it
is
taste
a
little
bit
of
corn
was
probably
cooked
enough
to
qualify
as
being
roasted
as
it
has
some
weak
flavor
to
it
even
the
muted
bastardized
wood
flavor
to
it
seemed
to
pop
in
every
now
and
then
its
cheap
but
still
not
worth
it
if
you
drink
this
stuff
with
any
degree
of
regularity
i
would
guess
you
are
not
in
a
good
place
this
is
another
beer
to
mow
and
play
golf
with
it
is
good
for
that
at
least
i
usually
have
this
in
cans
when
i
do
have
it
and
it
tastes
fine
smells
ok
drinks
well
and
is
cheap
and
easy
to
find
it
is
like
the
rest
of
these
mass
produced
beers
i
would
drink
it
again
extremely
pale
and
lacking
real
color
this
adjunct
is
lively
and
bubbly
smell
is
grainy
cooked
cafeteria
vegetables
corn
and
probably
a
good
amount
of
rice
in
here
malt
sweetness
and
a
hit
of
sour
odor
taste
is
light
sweet
and
finishing
of
grainy
mustiness
yes
lots
of
corn
in
here
finish
is
quick
and
neat
slight
lingering
metals
thin
and
watery
dousing
out
a
friend
who
is
on
fire
if
it
was
offered
to
me
at
a
bbq
and
thats
all
they
had
i
would
drink
it
its
overall
decent
and
far
from
the
worse
ive
had
poured
out
of
a
24oz
can
into
my
16oz
pint
glass
it
is
a
light
pale
straw
color
srm
of
maybe
2
i
mean
light
carbonation
is
uneven
and
they
are
all
sorts
of
sizes
smells
like
overcooked
veggies
and
corn
this
smell
is
enough
to
repel
you
tastes
like
come
on
guess
it
just
like
it
smells
again
overcooked
veggies
and
grain
with
hearty
helping
of
fodder
corn
not
even
good
sweet
corn
but
musty
fodder
corn
that
you
give
to
livestock
hops
are
minimal
if
they
are
there
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
wetting
i
guess
it
would
be
good
if
i
were
smoked
from
a
hard
days
worth
of
yard
work
drinkability
once
you
freeze
you
tastebuds
would
be
easy
serve
very
cold
if
you
want
some
good
ol
fashion
swill
btw
i
bought
this
for
1
09
for
a
24oz
this
beer
is
garbage
its
super
fake
tasting
with
no
real
character
and
just
tastes
like
sparkling
water
with
some
corn
and
grain
additives
i
usually
dont
even
detect
corn
in
the
other
typical
bmc
brews
but
i
really
picked
up
on
it
with
this
one
id
never
buy
busch
nor
would
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
even
if
they
preferred
the
usual
bmc
products
in
its
style
bud
is
better
though
a
bit
more
expensive
and
is
surely
a
more
wise
choice
and
rolling
rock
is
better
than
both
of
those
drinkability
figured
this
needed
a
try
since
the
last
one
i
had
was
20
years
ago
in
college
couldnt
even
finish
the
glass
just
bland
and
dull
pours
a
moderate
golden
color
and
actually
has
a
bit
of
head
smells
like
spent
grain
and
a
bit
of
bread
tastes
like
grain
husks
quite
light
mouthfeel
is
really
like
with
quite
a
bit
of
excess
carbonation
drinks
very
poorly
nothing
to
bring
me
back
for
more
and
i
didnt
enjoy
the
first
few
sips
poor
drinkability
beats
budweiser
and
mgd
in
my
tastetest
opinion
not
a
great
beer
but
great
for
its
category
and
thats
how
im
going
to
rate
it
since
im
still
talking
about
this
there
must
be
something
to
say
there
really
wasnt
much
degradation
as
this
one
warmed
and
though
its
pretty
much
unimpressive
all
around
nothing
overtly
offensive
arises
at
the
same
rate
mine
was
born
on
may
19
2010
which
puts
this
little
exercise
right
on
the
cusp
of
tasting
unfresh
glad
i
dodged
that
bullet
the
best
i
can
say
about
this
is
its
not
really
any
worse
than
bud
which
seems
barely
worth
the
whole
dollar
i
spent
on
this
dkind
of
reminds
of
seltzer
water
with
a
faint
fruitiness
to
it
not
trying
to
be
an
ass
it
just
goes
down
easy
for
what
is
a
pretty
watery
mainly
tasteless
beer
crystal
clear
very
pale
yellow
topped
by
a
shortlived
fizzy
cap
of
white
foam
faint
aroma
of
grain
a
little
bit
sweet
and
slightly
fruity
not
much
flavour
either
some
grain
low
bitterness
faint
yeast
or
bread
a
little
metallic
in
the
finish
very
dry
and
light
bodied
ample
carbonation
that
while
crisp
was
also
a
bit
coarse
overall
nothing
seriously
wrong
other
than
lack
of
character
just
not
a
lot
of
point
in
drinking
this
over
water
it
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
how
big
a
differenceread
drop
in
my
perceived
quality
there
is
in
beers
like
this
and
the
premium
beers
from
the
big
boys
i
could
not
really
recommend
this
one
but
again
i
was
on
the
beach
for
a
week
and
this
worked
at
that
exact
time
i
could
see
it
going
either
way
though
honestly
i
dont
hate
this
beer
it
kinda
has
a
dull
carbonation
taste
to
it
but
to
be
quite
frank
i
like
it
more
than
budweiser
it
smells
less
than
impressive
as
do
other
domestic
micros
the
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
becomes
tolerable
we
all
know
the
bud
bl
coors
keystone
etc
is
only
good
for
drinking
in
large
quantities
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
compared
to
the
others
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
to
me
this
is
like
a
middle
ground
between
bud
and
bud
light
if
you
can
tolerate
that
then
you
might
enjoy
this
beer
in
a
certain
circumstance
other
tasters
asked
me
about
a
tangy
taste
i
didnt
notice
it
but
figured
it
worthy
of
mention
they
were
unable
to
fully
describe
it
except
to
say
whats
that
tangy
bitterness
that
seems
to
come
from
the
carbonation
from
16
fl
oz
can
marked
06jun10hd17
sampled
on
july
6
2010
it
is
94
degrees
outside
and
this
is
perfect
for
such
an
occasion
cheap
to
buy
watered
down
and
easy
to
drink
it
pours
yellow
with
a
lot
of
fizz
that
dissolves
promptly
the
aroma
is
barley
driven
with
a
hint
of
hops
but
little
in
the
way
of
corn
and
grass
like
so
many
other
macros
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
miniscule
note
of
grains
and
hops
ok
so
it
is
not
a
craft
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
on
a
hazy
hot
humid
day
with
all
the
acs
running
it
hits
the
spot
better
in
the
can
than
bottle
i
think
d
i
dont
like
this
beer
its
not
that
i
particularly
hate
bmc
its
just
that
this
is
a
particularly
flavorless
and
painful
adjunct
lager
their
new
slogan
cold
as
a
mountain
stream
watery
as
a
sailors
grave
the
taste
is
cooked
vegetables
very
unappealing
a
little
malt
and
even
less
hops
are
also
present
thin
bodied
the
carbonation
is
fair
i
will
try
almost
anything
once
and
this
beer
is
proof
of
that
thanks
dude
d
i
guess
you
could
drink
it
to
get
drunk
but
other
then
that
there
is
no
point
to
buying
it
oh
yeah
its
cheap
we
need
to
get
more
people
away
from
this
beer
i
had
this
on
bottle
today
while
watching
baseball
it
was
a
bit
of
a
tastetest
exercise
i
had
a
pabst
first
one
of
my
favorite
macros
and
then
a
busch
second
an
unknown
to
me
i
preferred
the
pabst
maybe
because
i
was
predisposed
to
have
that
opinion
but
the
busch
was
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
with
some
flavor
busch
will
not
be
a
regular
for
me
but
i
will
not
pass
up
one
if
offered
also
my
friend
gave
5
99
at
the
local
grocery
store
for
a
12
pack
of
bottles
beer
should
not
be
judged
on
price
alone
of
course
but
that
seemed
like
a
fair
price
for
this
brew
it
is
a
gorgeous
beer
excellent
clarity
pale
golden
hue
and
generously
sized
head
nose
has
light
cereal
corn
husk
palate
is
watery
with
that
adjuncty
grain
flavor
but
not
too
offensive
easy
drinking
busch
beer
is
a
beer
that
is
brewed
by
anheuser
busch
with
an
abv
of

this
beer
is
just
an
average
american
beer
busch
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
appearance
is
like
every
outer
type
of
american
lager
the
small
is
sweet
with
some
grains
and
malts
the
taste
is
sweet
with
grains
and
malts
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
busch
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
drink
ability
is
high
good
down
smooth
overall
im
giving
busch
a
5
out
of
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
anheuserbusch
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
ok
since
there
isnt
much
to
it
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
this
beer
is
just
not
very
good
at
all
there
are
some
fairly
bad
beers
out
there
that
i
think
are
better
funky
corn
taste
with
a
tiny
bit
of
barley
malt
waterthin
drinkability
very
poor
avoid
i
have
consumed
enough
busch
to
float
a
boat
but
have
never
stopped
and
taken
the
time
to
appreciate
all
the
nuances
this
beer
has
to
offer
actually
poured
this
into
my
tulip
appears
a
bright
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
head
that
retreats
quickly
love
the
bubbles
from
the
laser
etching
though
they
amount
to
nothing
smell
is
th
typical
adjunct
corniness
not
much
else
going
on
in
this
department
taste
is
about
where
the
smell
is
has
a
very
light
flavor
nothing
to
write
home
about
here
feels
lightly
carbonated
and
surprisingly
smooth
easy
to
down
one
of
these
almost
average
drinkability
here
if
you
can
get
past
the
taste
i
suppose
this
beer
is
good
in
vast
quantities
at
tailgate
parties
and
ball
games
but
even
then
youd
be
better
off
with
regular
budweiser
which
isnt
saying
much
drinkable
but
only
just
if
youre
stuck
in
an
american
adjunct
situation
stick
with
pbr
this
is
pretty
bland
stuff
overall
it
seems
like
this
beer
is
not
as
well
known
as
other
economical
college
beers
thats
a
shame
because
its
one
of
the
better
ones
not
great
and
i
can
find
no
reason
to
drink
this
again
drinkability
nearly
entirely
devoid
of
flavor
and
character
it
works
to
get
some
alcohol
into
the
system
if
thats
your
thing
and
would
presumably
pair
with
essentially
any
foods
as
there
are
no
conflicting
flavors
appearance
is
light
golden

slight

note
light

would
not
buy
again
it
is
not
bad
it
is
not
good
it
is
a
cheap
nonoffensive
american
lager
that
millions
of
americans
drink
theres
goota
be
some
value
in
that
note
another
one
in
its
style
nothing
special
about
it
has
its
purposes
but
for
me
those
purposes
dont
come
around
much
anymore
very
thin
watery
and
alittle
dry
and
stale
but
it
is
smooth
regardless
this
isnt
bad
at
all
at
first
but
i
realize
not
even
half
way
through
the
glass
i
just
dont
want
anymore
poured

your
can
this

of
advertising
is
towards
the
good
ol
boys
i
guess
drinking
this
one
ice
cold
tastes
of
strong
rice
and
corn
and
can
also
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
no
head
but
lots
of
carbonated
bubbles
not
one
i
want
to
grab
on
a
regular
basis
bottoms
up
it
pours
to
a
light
straw
color
it
pours
to
about
12
in
head
that
hangs
around
for
about
3045
sec
it
has
a
decent
smell
that
to
me
smells
like
cereal
with
a
hint
of
hops
its
taste
is
average
but
not
very
strong
i
like
the
mouthfeel
it
is
light
in
your
mouth
which
is
to
me
is
odd
beings
that
the
beer
is
to
carbonated
its
drinkability
is
really
nice
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
clean
for
the
price
it
is
a
great
beer

drinkability
i
cannot
believe
i
used
to
drink
this
in
my
youth
its
a
beer
you
buy
in
12
barrels
to
host
college
parties
i
thought
i
would
take
a
step
back
in
time
and
now
i
wonder
what
the
hell
i
was
thinking
rjt
i
wouldnt
wish
this
over
much
on
anybody
but
sometimes
i
wouldnt
buy
it
with
my
own
money
but
if
its
ice
cold
i
will
drink
this
over
tap
water
busch
the
oldsmobile
of
beers
give
me
a
busch
over
a
natty
any
day
but
its
not
quite
as
filling
or
smooth
as
budweiser
which
isnt
saying
all
that
much
i
grew
up
drinking
this
stuff
in
high
school
and
college
i
liked
it
because
i
found
it
better
than
natty
and
most
light
beers
but
still
fairly
affordable
and
drinkable
hell
even
my
old
man
drinks
this
stuff
its
an
all
around
ok
beer
for
a
cheaper
american
lager
it
has
a
medium
amber
color
and
has
a
very
sharp
carbonated
taste
that
is
completely
unlike
natty
or
bud
overall
i
wouldnt
want
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
but
its
a
great
party
beer
or
a
really
good
cheaper
beer
on
a
hot
summers
day
just
as
a
thirst
quincher
its
drinkable
and
again
its
ok
for
what
it
is
d
if
you
want
to
drink
to
get
drunk
this
is
a
good
choice
otherwise
stay
away
from
busch
but
you
already
knew
that
didnt
you
cheers
not
the
worst
macro
out
there
its
better
than
coors
light
but
definitely
near
the
bottom
of
the
list
a
friend
of
mine
left
these
in
my
fridge
after
a
party
only
reason
i
tried
this
its
a
sink
pour
cool
can
though
the
special
edition
advantage
hd
camo
can
conclusion
a
not
very
good
representation
of
a
not
very
good
style
the
sweetness
just
kills
id
honestly
prefer
busch
light
over
this
its
a
bit
crisper
d
easy
to
pound
note
the
scoring
in
this
review
is
based
on
the
style
of
industrial
lager
it
should
be
viewed
as
a
reflection
of
this
beer
in
comparison
to
other
cheaply
made
mass
produced
fizzy
yellow
beers
d
this
is
absolutely
flavorless
i
guess
thats
an
impressive
accomplishment
given
the
fact
that
it
was
brewed
with
ingredients
of
some
sort
theres
really
no
reason
to
drink
this
its
like
someone
dropped
a
shot
glass
of
budweiser
into
a
cup
of
club
soda
another
of
the
if
its
offered
to
me
id
drink
it
but
wouldnt
buy
it
myself
beers
pours
a
light
yellow
with
small
head
smell
is
crips
but
unremarkable
taste
is
bland
but
not
offensive
ice
cold
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
itll
do
but
nothing
id
look
for
in
my
fridge
its
too
watery
d
it
has
a
little
alcohol
and
for
some
a
little
nostalgia
for
these
reasons
i
could
see
it
either
loved
or
hated
i
fall
in
the
latter
category
i
dont
traditionally
drink
a
lot
of
value
beers
other
than
hamms
or
the
occasional
pbr
so
i
thought
id
give
busch
a
try
this
can
came
in
a
brown
paper
bag
mfd
over
carbonated
light
in
body
corny
finish
busch
is
my
fav
cheap
beer
very
high
drinkability
rate
i
think
it
gets
a
bad
rep
if
you
would
try
a
fresh
busch
i
think
u
would
like
it
its
not
skunky
at
all
its
mellow
in
tastse
smell
is
fresh
its
got
a
little
kick
to
it
if
ur
use
to
drinkin
light
beer
so
go
get
some
salted
peanuts
in
the
shell
and
drink
a
cold
busch
drinkability
this
really
isnt
very
good
again
its
not
that
it
tastes
bad
so
to
speak
but
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
i
wouldnt
say
its
good
but
there
are
certainly
worse
options
this
is
easily
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
isnt
good
enough
to
be
a
lawnmower
beer
even
in
the
category
of
american
adjunct
lager
there
are
many
beers
that
are
better
stay
away
from
this
one
from
a
16
oz
can
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
corn
and
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
sweet
some
corn
and
malts
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
this
price
point
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
slight
head
the
smell
is
of
cheap
corn
and
rice
the
smell
is
very
faint
the
taste
is
of
cheap
grains
and
is
slightly
skunky
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
heavy
carbonation
overall
this
is
not
a
good
beer
the
taste
is
skunky
and
simple
it
is
slightly
harsh
to
take
down
this
my
friends
is
what
busch
did
to
me
when
i
drank
it
end
of
story
out
of
a
forty
bottle
this
beer
was
a
golden
color
with
a
good
amount
of
rising
carbonation
and
a
slightly
yellow
head
the
retention
was
good
as
a
collar
and
the
lacing
good
too
the
aroma
was
light
and
boring
macro
grains
and
some
stale
malt
the
flavors
were
dry
and
dominated
by
macro
grains
with
some
pale
malt
and
a
very
faint
hops
balancing
just
the
usual
junk
one
expects
from
this
style
the
mouthfeel
was
frothy
the
body
light
and
the
carbonation
high
in
truth
this
beer
is
exactly
what
i
expected
this
is
the
type
of
beer
you
shotgun
or
drink
like
water
to
get
total
smashed
not
something
i
would
drink
to
enjoy
thats
for
sure
not
a
great
beer
not
even
a
good
beer
but
if
these
are
free
send
another
my
way
pale
clear
pour
with
a
rocky
white
head
that
rapidly
fades
into
a
very
thin
lace
smells
of
clean
grains
maybe
a
lil
stale
funk
no
hop
aroma
no
corn
either
which
is
refreshing
many
cheaper
american
beers
are
too
corny
tastes
is
clean
and
fairly
dry
theres
a
bit
of
mild
sweetness
and
a
sting
of
hopshigh
carbonation
after
it
sits
in
the
glass
for
a
few
minutes
the
carbonation
fades
and
the
mouthfeel
becomes
a
little
slick
this
is
far
better
straight
from
the
can
as
it
wont
knock
the
fizz
out
of
it
by
pouring
it
drinks
easy
a
step
up
from
a
lot
of
cheap
beers
for
a
still
reasonable
price
pale
straw
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
melts
away
pretty
quickly
into
a
skim
the
smell
is
average
for
the
style
faint
grits
and
not
much
else
this
beer
lacks
flavor
but
what
it
does
have
isnt
very
good
a
slightly
more
sour
dry
husk
quality
than
most
of
its
ilk
highly
carbonated
with
a
dry
squeaky
clean
finish
not
very
good
overall
but
ive
had
worse
you
know
what
this
isnt
bad
imo
it
is
as
good
as
budweiser
and
much
cheaper
hey
its
yellowy
pissy
coloured
and
smells
like
cheap
beer
however
it
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
enjoy
this
at
a
bbq
and
although
not
very
sophisticated
it
serves
its
purpose
it
is
what
it
is
a
good
pour
resulted
in
two
fingers
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
the
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
this
must
have
been
what
greg
koch
had
in
mind
when
he
mentioned
fizzy
yellow
beer
the
nose
had
a
light
lagerlike
sweetness
but
i
really
had
to
inhale
deeply
to
experience
anything
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
with
a
very
mild
lager
taste
on
the
tongue
it
was
slightly
dry
and
refreshing
in
the
finish
but
i
might
as
well
have
been
drinking
air
i
drink
this
beer
more
often
than
not
because
im
pretty
broke
so
it
beats
drink
the
hard
shit
like
steel
reserve
or
natty
im
drinking
natty
right
now
becuase
im
broker
and
i
want
to
get
drunk
its
not
the
greatest
beer
and
i
agree
its
sub
par
to
most
beers
but
the
number
one
thing
its
great
for
parties
i
drink
busch
with
my
bikerfamily
buddies
and
with
my
best
friend
especially
when
money
is
tight
its
not
as
strong
as
natural
ice
but
the
taste
isnt
disgusting
at
least
compared
to
some
of
the
cheaper
things
out
there
busch
isnt
a
beer
i
crave
but
anyone
with
hair
on
their
chest
can
get
it
down
it
just
tastes
like
milwaukees
best
or
bud
light
final
thoughts
who
the
fuck
is
into
aging
canned
macros
and
the
name
busch
is
nowhere
near
being
smooth
the
only
thing
this
beer
delivers
on
is
the
carbonation
busch
heavy
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
mi
dont
even
know
what
to
put
here
its
busch
its
crisp
and
pretty
smooth
the
drinkability
is
reasonably
ok
its
not
quite
as
unappealing
as
my
review
comes
off
but
not
good
either
there
are
other
macro
lagers
id
go
for
before
i
resorted
to
this
one
d
when
in
need
for
cheap
beer
go
for
it
if
power
drinking
is
a
need
i
would
rather
drink
natty
light
for
mass
drinking
occations
my
brotherinlaw
gave
me
one
the
other
day
and
its
ok
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
taste
to
it
but
doesnt
taste
bad
either
to
me
i
guess
ill
be
drinking
it
when
i
go
over
there
to
visit
its
all
he
drinks
as
for
me
i
wouldnt
buy
it
though
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
this
is
a
very
bad
tasting
beer
i
will
say
that
it
looks
better
in
a
glass
than
most
cheap
mass
prodcued
beers
it
has
more
color
and
a
tad
better
of
a
smell
to
it
but
everything
else
is
terrible
ok
i
started
out
on
the
stuff
so
i
am
slightly
biased
i
fuigure
if
it
was
good
enough
for
me
as
a
youngun
then
its
good
enough
for
me
now
i
used
to
love
busch
but
as
my
palate
has
developed
i
very
rarely
drink
this
stuff
it
is
reserved
for
tailgating
at
michigan
games
i
rated
it
high
though
because
compared
to
bud
miller
and
coors
i
think
it
is
superior
it
has
also
appeared
in
at
least
two
movies
navy
seals
and
vegas
vacation
cousin
eddie
would
never
steer
me
wrong
okay
this
is
the
beer
i
was
weaned
on
so
there
is
no
way
i
can
give
it
a
really
bad
rating
grew
up
in
st
louis
area
toy
caldwell
the
legend
from
the
marshall
tucker
band
did
a
radio
commercial
in
early
90s
for
it
i
used
to
have
the
bottle
caps
cover
the
light
knob
and
such
on
my
74
maverick
busch
beer
is
what
it
is
and
actually
it
is
really
good
on
a
hot
daynight
too
many
fond
memories
to
crap
on
this
beer
cheers
forever
busch
poured
to
a
two
fingered
snow
white
head
with
a
hard
pour
right
down
the
middle
of
the
glass
beer
was
a
very
light
yellow
with
no
bubbles
also
no
lacing
head
disappeared
within
about
2
minutes
not
a
lot
of
smell
going
on
here
maybe
some
corn
and
a
whole
lot
of
nothing
tasted
very
light
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
not
a
lot
of
taste
either
carbonation
was
ok
at
best
maybe
if
you
cooled
this
beer
down
to
32
degress
and
drank
it
fast
after
mowing
your
lawn
it
might
quench
your
thirst
and
cool
you
off
if
that
didnt
work
pour
the
cold
beer
over
your
head
that
should
cool
you
off
i
wouldnt
buy
one
i
was
just
being
nice
to
dad
as
macro
lagers
go
this
is
not
too
bad
i
poured
it
in
a
glass
and
it
looks
unimpressive
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
disapears
has
a
pleasant
sweet
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
of
adjunct
lagers
not
as
sweet
as
grain
belt
but
sweeter
than
pbr
not
as
fizzy
as
well
overall
a
decent
lager
and
very
easy
to
drink
yes
this
beer
is
not
good
compared
to
oh
say
a
dales
or
well
to
almost
any
other
beer
ever
it
pours
yellow
has
a
metallic
smell
it
tastes
thin
and
watery
although
also
faintly
of
bananas
however
i
will
sure
choose
this
over
a
bud
or
coors
this
is
reminiscent
of
freezing
your
young
unrefined
ass
off
in
dead
winter
in
a
tiny
midwest
town
standing
around
a
bonfire
because
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
but
stare
at
a
fire
while
drinking
busch
thinking
of
how
to
escape
your
tiny
midwest
town
certainly
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
buy
but
if
given
i
will
drink
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
short
head
and
poor
retention
no
lacing
present
smells
of
adjunct
in
a
weak
lager
fits
the
style
tastes
of
adjunct
in
a
weak
lager
crisp
with
a
slight
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
low
carbonation
overall
not
a
real
good
beer
vaguely
yellow
pournot
much
of
an
aromasweet
cornish
rather
sweet
taste
and
very
light
bodied
with
just
some
creamed
corn
flavor
dull
mouthfeel
no
bitterness
no
hopskind
of
skunky
and
blanddrinkable
but
not
very
good
a
little
better
on
tap
but
really
the
only
upside
is
the
drinkabliity
im
not
saying
its
enjoyable
but
it
is
definitely
easy

the
can
inspired
me
im
going
to
drink
a
busch
beer
next
time
i
have
the
rifle
out
drinkability
goes
down
really
smooth
making
it
good
for
getting
drunk
on
the
cheap
if
thats
your
thing
it
has
plenty
of
off
white
head
there
is
only
a
little
bit
of
lace
it
has
a
golden
body
it
has
a
vague
and
plain
smell
there
is
a
little
bit
of
graininess
to
the
aroma
and
that
is
about
it
he
taste
is
also
pretty
basic
it
is
watery
and
grainy
slightly
adjunct
it
is
not
as
carbonated
as
most
beers
this
cheap
it
is
not
the
worst
of
the
cheap
beers
drinkability
i
can
drink
this
without
too
many
complaints
but
this
kinda
beer
isnt
forgiving
and
must
be
drank
cold
and
it
goes
skunky
very
easy
d
refreshing
and
drinkable
not
a
bad
macro
somewhat
on
the
sweet
side
lived
off
this
stuff
in
college
it
was
only
5
79
a
12
pack
remembered
it
being
more
fullflavored
not
so
much
anymore
above
average
bargain
beer
and
a
decent
yard
beer
not
very
drinkable
the
taste
is
terrible
very
below
average
a
step
above
natural
light
but
this
beer
really
lacks
flavor
and
is
unhealthily
pale
as
far
as
looks
are
concerned
dont
look
for
much
of
a
smell
from
this
beer
you
wont
get
any
its
macro
and
its
very
obvious
stay
away
from
this
one
pours
from
the
12
oz
can
the
standard
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
into
a
modest
collar
the
standard
macro
fizziness
shows
a
seemingly
endless
supply
of
tiny
bubbles
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
1st
sip
tastes
like
corn
chips
seriously
it
tastes
like
a
glass
of
liqified
fritos
after
letting
the
beer
warm
up
for
a
few
minutes
the
fritos
taste
diminshes
and
is
replaced
by
a
watery
slightly
metallic
bitterness
chased
by
a
corny
grainy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
superlight
drink
it
its
gone
overall
its
your
basic
standard
macro
lager
it
was
offered
to
me
by
a
friend
i
accepted
it
to
be
social
im
drinking
it
only
to
pad
my
number
of
reviews
this
is
strictly
for
the
diehard
macro
lover
i
usually
drink
this
beer
at
sports
bars
because
they
always
have
cheap
specials
on
cans
its
perfectly
fine
for
slamming
down
while
watching
a
football
game
and
grubbin
a
pile
of
wings
and
very
refreshing
on
hot
days
its
like
a
watered
down
bud
with
less
sweetness
but
more
flavor
alcohol
than
a
bud
light
adjunct
and
weak
malt
just
like
youd
expect
without
a
trace
of
hops
to
be
found
though
im
sure
they
add
a
little
for
posterity
still
its
pretty
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
when
its
ice
cold
nothing
noteworthy
but
nothing
offensive
sampled
quite
a
few
years
ago
dont
bother
with
this
one
seriously
in
college
i
preferred
the
light
or
even
natural
over
this
very
pale
looking
musty
mix
of
corn
grain
rice
malt
lots
of
water
but
doesnt
go
down
very
easily
i
dont
want
to
slam
it
but
this
beer
is
bad
avoid
at
all
costs
get
a
mickeys
instead
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
that
leaves
as
quick
as
it
came
smell
is
of
corn
and
sweetness
and
that
is
pretty
much
the
flavor
as
well
super
thin
mouthfeel
and
the
flavor
of
sweet
corn
prevail
like
i
said
stick
to
mickeys
if
you
want
a
decent
beer
at
budget
price
d
fairly
nonoffensive
though
comes
off
a
tad
corny
at
times
and
watery
ah
yes
buds
younger
red
headed
brother
i
used
to
drink
this
like
it
was
going
out
of
style
in
school
today
i
was
able
to
revisit
this
one
during
a
golf
outing
free
swill
sure
ill
sample
em
all
light
and
bitter
with
lots
of
adjuncts
mixed
in
it
isnt
horrible
to
drink
but
its
not
much
either
i
was
hesitant
because
of
the
beer
advocate
rating
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
busch
regular
is
a
very
good
beer
and
for
the
price
it
is
exceptional
i
will
definitely
start
purchasing
it
by
the
case
for
approximately
50
cents
per
can
you
can
pay
more
and
i
have
tasted
better
but
for
day
in
and
day
out
drinking
why
pale
yellow
some
would
call
it
pisscolored
with
a
bit
of
suds
smells
like
dms
lots
of
cooked
vegetable
with
a
little
bready
pale
malt
in
the
background
the
flavor
while
bland
isnt
offensive
which
is
alway
the
threshold
of
bad
beer
instead
this
lends
a
light
toast
taste
with
a
bit
of
lager
tang
which
is
almost
fruity
sort
of
like
an
artificial
fruit
flavor
the
carbonation
is
appropriate
not
too
sharp
not
too
flat
and
while
this
beer
isnt
out
and
out
offensive
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
another
still
considering
the
style
this
could
be
a
lot
worse
its
a
blue
collar
beer
and
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
that
it
isnt
this
is
without
question
the
single
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
foul
from
top
to
bottom
a
funky
tasting
over
carbonated
gas
bomb
i
made
it
through
half
a
glass
tossed
it
down
the
sink
and
gave
the
other
five
to
my
wife
shell
drink
any
fizzy
yellow
pee
pee
you
put
in
front
of
her
lucky
for
me
more
money
to
buy
myself
some
good
beer
if
anyone
gives
you
one
of
these
look
at
them
with
suspicion
obviously
they
mean
you
harm
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
12
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
the
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
gold
with
a
generous
white
fluffy
head
that
didnt
last
the
aroma
grassy
malts
with
some
hoppy
hints
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
bodied
but
not
totally
watery
there
is
a
dryness
in
the
mouthfeel
the
flavour
is
almost
nonexistent
the
taste
is
funky
with
lots
of
grain
i
detenct
bitterness
and
lots
of
off
flavors
not
the
best
feel
very
foamy
and
light
drinkability
is
through
the
floor
not
the
ceiling
this
stuff
is
just
plain
watery
and
near
tasteless
thanks
to
my
neighbor
denver
for
sharing
his
favorite
beer
with
me
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
straw
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
body
is
very
clear
and
clean
with
plenty
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
mostly
salty
and
hay
like
a
metal
can
note
is
also
detected
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
light
light
malts
cut
with
rice
are
most
noticeable
its
also
salty
and
has
some
very
light
bitterness
to
it
busch
is
light
bodied
and
thin
with
lots
of
fizzy
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
and
abrupt
the
taste
is
minerally
very
watery
bland
there
is
a
faint
hint
of
corn
or
other
grain
rather
sweet
on
the
first
sip
but
afterwards
this
vanishes
leaving
only
an
utterly
bland
watery
quality
tasting
only
very
faintly
of
metal
and
minerals
it
is
rough
like
most
macrolagers
best
to
avoid
completely
in
my
opinion
this
is
better
than
bud
and
cheaper
too
overall
while
not
an
awardwinning
micro
full
of
flavor
this
went
down
rather
easy
if
im
low
on
cash
next
time
i
wouldnt
rule
this
entirely
out
but
might
opt
for
the
pabst
instead
hey
in
my
humble
opinion
it
tasted
as
good
if
not
slightly
better
than
the
overpriced
budlight
budselect
etc
that
everybody
drinks
and
at
half
the
price
d
another
i
didnt
wanna
finish
but
i
almost
did
drinkability
the
taste
isnt
going
to
bring
you
back
only
reason
to
drink
this
is
if
you
are
offered
and
want
to
be
polite
not
horrendous
or
undrinkable
but
not
much
of
a
beer
at
all
i
was
house
sitting
for
my
friends
while
they
were
in
disney
world
and
they
had
two
30packs
left
over
from
new
years
dont
ask
me
why
i
believe
it
was
a
drunk
purchase
anyway
the
beer
doesnt
have
any
noticeable
flavors
to
it
all
malt
no
hoppyness
doesnt
have
much
of
a
smell
either
only
the
smell
you
get
from
an
aluminum
can
lots
of
carbonation
and
it
it
kind
of
smooth
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
it
wouldnt
be
bad
for
a
round
of
beer
pong
or
two
other
than
that
nothing
really
great
about
it
but
better
than
other
yellow
fizzy
beers
thin
beer
with
a
funny
aftertaste
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
it
down
beer
is
beer
so
i
dont
want
to
slam
busch
i
just
dont
like
it
i
wouldnt
proclaim
this
to
be
an
exemplary
beer
by
any
means
but
i
think
its
unfairly
judged
more
often
than
not
d
although
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
its
one
of
my
favorites
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
for
its
price
76pack
of
pounders
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
bit
of
head
does
not
have
much
of
a
scent
a
little
maltiness
but
not
much
same
with
the
taste
nearly
water
with
a
bit
of
malt
its
fairly
refreshing
but
only
so
much
as
water
is
it
goes
down
fine
fairly
smooth
as
far
as
all
beers
go
its
pretty
bad
but
for
a
macro
lager
its
not
horrible
around
average
sorry
auggie
12
ounce
bottle
born
on
date
of

served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
an
inch
and
half
white
head
head
retention
is
low
lacing
is
average
smells
like
sweet
malt
and
corn
the
aroma
isnt
bad
at
all
its
nonoffensive
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
tastes
like
sweet
malt
and
corn
no
offensive
flavors
at
all
mouthfeel
is
light
with
above
average
carbonation
also
its
a
little
bit
on
the
watery
side
however
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
if
i
wanted
to
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
for
a
macro
lager
its
really
not
bad
at
all
not
too
bad
on
a
hot
day
either
i
enjoyed
drinking
a
couple
tall
boys
of
these
at
a
cardinals
baseball
game
a
couple
years
ago
yeah
its
not
great
but
if
close
to
being
fresh
it
certainly
isnt
bad
either
there
are
certainly
worse
beers
in
this
style
to
choose
i
would
avoid
this
beer
even
at
its
very
low
cost
just
no
kick
or
taste
and
the
taste
that
is
there
is
bitter
and
not
very
smooth
when
youre
14
years
old
sneak
into
your
stepfathers
stash
with
the
sole
purpose
of
drinking
a
beer
for
the
alchoholic
affect
and
still
cant
finish
an
entire
can
because
the
taste
is
too
disgusting
you
can
rest
assured
as
a
legalaged
adult
this
is
a
label
from
which
to
stay
far
far
away
this
is
what
alot
of
us
grew
up
on
dont
forsake
the
past
because
youre
a
beer
snob
now
just
because
you
puked
it
in
college
does
not
make
it
a
bad
beer
now
easy
to
slam
not
pretty
but
very
quenching
lots
of
corn
and
it
gets
kinda
bad
as
it
warms
would
go
great
with
just
about
any
meal
only
because
the
flavor
isnt
strong
enough
to
offend
slightly
grainy
however
i
think
it
to
be
the
king
of
cheap
beers
d
average
drinking
beer
i
bought
this
to
review
and
seeing
as
how
id
never
had
one
at
the
age
of
32
i
expect
i
will
not
buy
this
regularly
heres
the
thing
if
i
could
hand
out
worst
beer
ever
made
award
id
hand
it
to
coors
light
but
there
are
tangible
factors
such
as
ad
campaign
and
availability
name
the
last
time
you
went
into
a
bar
that
wasnt
a
beer
bar
and
coors
light
was
a
not
on
draft
b
not
on
special
and
c
didnt
have
a
cardboard
woman
somewhere
but
this
is
the
worst
tasting
beer
ever
i
could
right
through
the
beer
as
if
i
were
superman
and
there
is
absolutely
no
smell
i
imagine
had
i
had
the
can
and
poured
from
there
i
might
have
smelled
aluminum
when
it
comes
to
the
taste
i
couldnt
pick
up
anything
except
a
few
grains
and
water
i
say
that
because
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
beer
wo
grain
and
water
correct
worse
part
i
was
drinking
while
watching
a
game
and
then
the
realization
came
that
i
had
paid
10
to
drink
flavored
water
hit
me
when
i
had
to
throw
the
empty
box
away
stonecold
sober
avoid
this
macro
at
all
costs
drinkability
i
got
this
one
free
and
i
never
turn
down
a
free
beer
but
this
time
the
joke
is
on
me
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
have
drank
many
of
them
bbqing
by
the
pool
during
the
summer
another
pale
lager
from
anheuserbusch
that
is
not
much
different
from
the
rest
of
their
pale
lager
lineup
pours
pale
yellow
with
fastfading
white
head
smell
aroma
is
a
good
thing
is
not
inviting
and
taste
is
not
too
good
either
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
used
to
drink
these
in
longnecks
how
my
palate
has
matured
not
a
good
beer
d
bland
yet
refreshing
macro
hurt
by
off
flavour
ill
be
avoiding
this
one
would
not
drink
this
again
even
if
it
was
given
to
me
not
a
fan
of
this
particular
beer
this
is
a
beer
you
have
just
for
the
sake
of
drinkning
beerit
goes
down
very
easylike
drinking
watervery
well
priced
and
i
buy
it
quite
oftenyou
know
when
you
just
want
to
grab
a
beer
and
drinkforget
about
the
high
priced
ones
and
no
judging
or
anything
just
drink
beer
i
do
like
this
one
for
some
reasonquite
drinkable
especially
ice
coldhell
i
can
drink
this
one
anytime
d
good
a
good
macro
lager
beer
i
went
into
this
beer
expecting
to
hate
it
but
you
cant
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
and
this
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
favourite
macro
beers
ever
i
am
now
a
busch
fan
busch
scores
adequately
by
college
standards
funny
thing
is
im
a
college
student
and
i
think
this
is
garbage
icehouse
is
coming
up
tomorrow
in
the
college
invitational
goes
down
easy
like
water
low
enough
abv
means
you
could
drink
more
if
you
like
but
therein
lies
the
problem
as
there
isnt
much
to
like
pours
a
light
pale
color
with
a
nice
head
smells
malty
and
sweet
with
the
aroma
of
rice
mixed
in
not
unlike
many
other
macro
lagers
taste
is
somewhat
smooth
and
bland
but
not
too
offensive
tastes
ok
cold
and
its
not
too
bad
for
a
macro
lager
i
actually
like
this
more
than
natural
ab
should
market
this
is
as
a
malt
liquorkiller
or
something
halfjoking
i
cant
rate
it
that
low
as
its
not
that
offensive
born
on

ps
i
get
a
kick
out
of
all
the
super
low
reviews
for
this
beer
for
an
american
macro
lager
its
dead
on
its
style
drinkability
really
light
for
a
regular
american
lager
not
much
beer
though
even
at
the
relatively
low
price
nothing
to
really
recommend
this
but
it
is
as
above
inoffensive
d
this
is
one
of
the
least
offensive
macro
lagers
that
ive
had
its
not
really
tasty
but
its
basically
flavorless
so
its
hard
to
like
and
hard
to
dislike
does
that
make
sense
so
for
those
who
just
want
to
slake
a
thirst
and
get
a
buzz
this
is
highly
drinkable
but
for
me
it
just
doesnt
hold
my
interest
labatts
blue
pbr
and
stag
have
much
more
character
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
was
watery
i
think
the
active
carbonation
helped
the
beer
over
all
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
if
you
drink
your
beer
fast
this
will
work
it
will
be
awhile
before
i
journey
into
the
gas
station
the
beer
was
honestly
better
from
the
can
than
a
glass
final
statement
better
than
i
expected
in
the
sense
it
had
no
flavour
but
still
very
poor
this
is
an
alcoholic
soft
drink
drinkability
is
average
for
the
style
i
guess
i
had
a
fresh
one
because
it
wasnt
that
bad
it
was
watery
and
thin
but
no
off
flavors
just
a
little
adjunct
flavor
on
top
of
the
water
and
lo
and
behold
i
actually
percieved
a
mild
gummy
hop
bitterness
and
aroma
like
i
said
i
guess
i
had
a
fresh
one
a
really
fresh
one
im
used
to
seeing
empty
cans
of
these
piled
all
over
my
brothers
sleeping
body
when
i
peak
in
on
him
most
saturday
mornings
most
recently
there
was
still
one
left
in
his
minifridge
in
his
bedroom
so
i
cracked
it
open
as
i
wated
for
him
to
wake
up
thats
how
i
came
across
this
one
i
try
with
fast
food
only
drink
3
of
a
six
the
other
i
got
for
a
collection
60
recommended
one
of
the
better
american
macros
it
certainly
isnt
a
showstopper
but
it
has
it
has
a
good
place
as
a
party
beer
and
a
way
to
beat
the
summer
heat
d
it
could
be
worse
the
aftertaste
really
got
to
me
a
couple
times
it
made
my
skin
crawl
i
used
to
drink
this
one
years
ago
as
a
kid
by
no
means
a
great
beer
but
while
ive
had
many
beers
that
are
much
better
in
my
new
sampling
hobby
ive
also
had
some
that
are
worse
had
this
over
the
holidays
poured
into
an
icy
cold
schooner
served
with
fried
onion
rings
taste
and
palate
were
not
much
but
a
smooth
refreshing
beer
especially
given
the
price
overall
a
light
tasting
easy
drinking
waterlike
beer
you
could
drink
these
all
day
but
why
would
you
want
to
the
beer
itself
however
is
boring
the
beer
is
a
light
color
lighter
than
some
ciders
there
is
almost
no
head
the
smell
is
slightly
corny
and
sweet
the
taste
is
not
bad
just
not
much
flavor
present
the
mouthfeel
is
fair
cold
it
is
smooth
and
drinkable
this
beer
is
good
for
camping
and
general
late
night
country
happenings
so
for
drinkability
this
is
actually
not
too
bad
good
for
the
intended
audience
gitrdone
d
i
found
that
after
23
of
these
puppies
the
horrible
aftertaste
just
gets
to
be
too
much
set
it
down
walk
away
overall
its
cheap
and
theres
a
reason
for
that
overall
a
very
poor
beer
even
for
style
this
is
pretty
bad
cheap
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
in
this
case
better
to
spend
the
extra
money
and
get
something
better
drinkability
was
pretty
bad
i
wouldnt
really
ever
have
more
than
one
cheers
update
071207
the
main
thing
i
remember
about
this
was
last
summer
it
was
a
regular
in
the
firdge
we
went
through
a
bunch
while
working
in
the
garden
yard
etc
i
have
since
lowered
my
opinion
eric
ill
probably
never
return
to
this
stuff
except
maybe
at
family
gatherings
reunions
and
such
about
all
thats
going
for
it
is
that
it
is
easy
to
down
d
high
especially
on
a
hot
day
while
the
coals
warm
up
for
the
grill
busch
beer
pours
a
typical
macro
fizzy
yellow
from
a
twenty
four
ounce
can
smells
like
cheap
beer
adjunct
city
corn
is
most
noticeable
to
me
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
tasting
of
the
macro
lagers
not
good
by
any
stretch
but
very
drinkable
i
prefer
this
to
most
of
the
macros
if
only
by
a
little
bit
the
story
some
of
my
buschbudweiser
drinking
friends
tell
is
that
they
were
at
the
brewery
and
they
were
told
that
busch
costs
more
to
make
than
bud
but
they
sell
it
for
less
than
bud
because
its
named
for
the
family
true
or
not
it
is
decent
by
macro
standards
i
had
a
another
thought
that
this
beer
actually
might
be
better
served
with
spicy
hot
chinese
food
and
dumplings
where
the
food
is
primary
though
a
bottle
of
tsing
tsao
would
be
my
first
choice
on
the
whole
a
very
competent
effort
at
this
market
level
from
ab
it
doesnt
have
budweisers
fleeting
fruitiness
and
its
not
as
supercrisp
as
bud
dry
but
it
does
have
more
midpalate
presence
than
either
its
priced
similarly
to
bud
dry
but
goes
for
a
mellowness
in
contrast
to
bud
drys
clean
sharpness
i
compared
it
directly
with
miller
high
life
and
it
did
not
register
a
knockout
but
neither
was
it
beaten
mhl
is
richer
but
the
busch
finishes
cleaner
and
has
better
texture
it
might
not
keep
up
with
pbr
or
schlitz
but
it
wont
be
embarrassed
by
them
either
heavily
underrated
owing
to
antiab
sentiment
and
i
suspect
its
redneck
image
but
the
brew
itself
particularly
given
the
price
has
nothing
to
apologize
for
a
good
side
about
this
beer
is
that
it
doesnt
have
heavy
additives
to
it
and
despite
the
lack
of
taste
literally
it
is
kind
of
refreshing
if
you
want
to
chug
down
a
bunch
to
get
drunk
and
it
will
take
at
least
10
of
these
for
super
cheap
here
you
go
this
beer
is
pretty
much
average
for
the
style
it
pours
a
strawyellow
with
a
bit
of
a
head
into
my
clearcollored
platic
cup
there
is
not
much
a
smell
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
what
i
would
expect
a
bit
of
adjuncty
corn
with
a
slight
skunky
hoppy
finish
this
beer
is
pretty
crisp
and
finishes
clean
so
it
works
well
for
inexpensive
session
drinking
notes
ehhh
i
can
drink
these
no
problem
if
your
forced
i
could
see
this
being
used
as
a
golf
course
beer
if
you
must
i
think
i
rated
bud
light
higher
than
this
but
if
im
going
to
actually
drink
shitty
beer
i
would
probably
save
my
money
and
buy
this
over
bud
i
mean
the
only
reason
to
drink
these
beers
is
to
get
wasted
so
why
spend
more
than
you
have
to
pale
yellow
with
a
medium
white
foamy
quickly
and
fully
diminishing
head
smells
of
cooked
veggie
and
weak
grain
taste
is
quite
lame
a
little
crisp
with
a
short
lightly
yeasty
finish
it
has
a
thin
body
and
a
sodalike
texture
even
when
compared
to
other
cheapos
this
stuff
still
sucks
as
far
as
american
macro
lagers
go
this
isnt
a
very
good
one
have
it
cold
and
its
not
too
bad
let
it
warm
up
and
taste
the
nonbarley
cereal
grain
hey
at
least
theyre
up
front
on
the
label
natural
indeed
watery
yet
manages
to
have
an
unpleasant
corn
syrup
flavor
as
well
honestly
i
prefer
busch
light
drinkability
gave
me
a
headache
after
drinking
it
spend
an
extra
2
bucks
and
buy
some
bud
or
natty
lite
instead
bottom
line
you
know
what
youre
getting
yourself
into
when
you
buy
busch
beer
a
means
of
intoxication
overall
it
is
a
waste
of
your
time
exactly
like
little
brother
but
for
pennies
more
meh
if
you
want
cheap
american
beer
schlitz
or
high
life
are
the
same
price
and
much
better
tasting
this
is
pretty
much
the
beer
that
i
cut

teeth
on

a

beer
really
not
very
good
i
think
rating
for
look
and
feel
is
bs
so
i
give
them
all
5s
grew
up
on
this
shitty
beer
and
will
always
drink
it
because
it
gets
the
job
done
my
ny
cheap
beer
of
choice
never
tasted
that
good
but
proud
to
drink
it
there
is
not
much
going
on
with
this
beer
but
for
this
style
of
beer
it
is
not
bad
i
actually
enjoy
it
it
brings
back
the
great
memories
of
college

at

i
am

its

with

nil

its
the
kind
of

you
drink
when
you
just
want
a
plain
ol
beer
style
wise
when
compared
to
its
peers
its
certainly
the
best
among
them
ill
take
this
any
day
if
my
options
are
bud
miller
or
coors
i
was
afraid
this
would
be
like
the
silver
stallion
i
once
encountered
at
the
same
place
but
this
was
a
decent
nofrills
macrostyle
lager
unlike
other
beer
finds
in
such
stores
this
didnt
appear
to
have
been
sitting
on
a
shelf
for
a
long
time
and
was
pretty
drinkable
for
what
it
was
by
no
means
was
this
something
id
tell
someone
to
seek
out
as
its
pretty
interchangeable
for
many
other
similar
beers
but
for
the
same
price
id
buy
it
again
light
on
the
palate
as
well
as
the
pocketbook
maybe
a
hint
of
metallic
out
of
the
can
as
it
warms
up
but
hey
thats
your
fault
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
and
a
smooth
drinking
lager
o
good
session
beer
its
a
bit
like
budweiser
except
this
tastes
like
a
real
beer
this
would
be
a
great
lawnmower
beer
if
i
had
lawn
opretty
typical
aal
a
good
choice
because
its
cheaper
then
most

go
pay
your
101520

you
think
is
amazing
however
most
of
you
snobs
would
not
know
a
decent
beer
if
it
bit
your
ass
off
and
stole
your
bmw
why
do
so
many
of
you
beer
snobs
hate
american
lagers
so
much
anyway
i
guess
it
really
does
not
matter
whybecause
those
of
us
that
actually
work
for
a
living
will
alwaysalways
enjoy
an
ice
cold
american
lager
after
a
hard
days
workand
appreciate
the
price
point
of
a
very
good
beerbeerwolf666
its
hard
to
beat
for
a
watching
the
game
beer
pours
beautifully
straw
colored
golden
with
a
fat
white
head
that
fell
fast
and
left
splotchy
lacing
brilliant
clarity
you
could
read
through
it
lots
of
bubbles
streaming
up
to
the
top
nose
is
faint
light
grain
and
a
touch
of
cooked
corn
a
bit
of
hop
herbal
and
perfectly
clean
no
fruity
esters
whatsoever
just
lovely
taste
is
crisp
with
some
firm
carbonation
light
sweet
grain
cooked
corn
that
is
sweet
and
delicious
there
is
a
touch
of
mineral
or
metallic
on
the
palate
but
its
from
the
water
this
finishes
dry
and
with
a
nice
little
bitter
to
tease
you
into
more
and
more
light
smooth
mouthfeel
and
you
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
but
it
is
thin
and
develops
a
watery
quality
as
it
warms
it
also
gains
a
bit
of
sour
taste
from
the
combined
grains
as
ti
warms
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
o
this
is
a
great
hot
day
beer
considering
what
it
is
it
isnt
too
bad
ill
take
a
cream
ale
or
12
horse
over
a
genesee
beer
but
i
wont
turn
one
down
if
its
all
there
is
overall
meh
as
expected
for
adjunct
lager
but
not
as
bad
as
the
off
flavors
are
not
overpowering
this
is
a
great
little
adjunct
lager
for
an
adjunct
lager
im
going
to
go
ahead
and
rate
it
within
its
style
because
why
not
its
very
very
smooth
inoffensive
and
has
a
supremely
pleasant
mouthfeel
to
it
while
delivering
a
desirable
taste
its
got
all
the
basics
the
basics
that
youd
think
are
the
bare
minimum
for
a
beer
but
many
of
the
most
popular
brands
seem
to
almost
try
to
sink
below
that
this
however
is
a
great
goto
inoffensive
lager
i
can
honestly
say
i
enjoyed
it
the
extremely
light
colour
worried
me
at
first
but
the
lacing
on
my
glass
mug
was
decent
and
it
had
more
taste
than
it
looked
like
it
would
i
made
a
good
choice
by
giving
this
a
try
overall
with
the
brewery
right
up
the
road
this
is
one
cheap
brew
thats
fresh
and
cold
beats
most
of
the
other
adjuncts
out
there
in
flavor
mouthfeel
is
just
carbonated
water
you
gotta
be
a
local
or
accept
advertising
money
to
think
this
is
good
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
nonic
the
beer
is
a
pale
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
bubbling
and
a
tall
frothy
light
white
head
that
settles
into
a
filmy
coating
clingy
all
over
the
glass
aromas
of
toasted
grains
and
not
much
else
a
bit
musty
and
stale
flavors
of
roast
with
a
buttery
backbone
and
corn
overtones
bleh
roasty
and
stale
aftertaste
with
a
quick
uneventful
finish
not
good
thanks
for
the
memory
genesse
no
marines
where
harmed
in
the
making
of
this
memory
just
a
couple
dozen
of
the
finest
sailors
you
would
ever
meet
bless
their
immortal
souls
you
will
find
that
trying
to
session
this
beer
will
be
difficult
the
pints
are
cheap
so
its
worth
a
try
at
a
minimum
thanks
o
genny
is
an
easy
to
drink
tasty
session
beer
imo
it
has
a
nicer
flavor
profile
than
bmc
it
is
a
lot
more
full
bodied
than
bmc
and
is
a
great
alternative
to
the
large
natl
brewery
offerings
i
forgot
to
mention
that
it
is
really
cheap
please
dont
let
that
turn
you
off
from
buying
it
you
won
t
be
disappointed
just
remember
what
style
of
beer
it
is
from
my
rating
book
back
in
1984
poured
to
a
golden
color
was
clear
in
appearance
and
did
not
develop
much
of
a
head
aroma
was
fruity
and
somewhat
stale
taste
was
sweet
and
on
the
bland
side
aftertaste
was
mild
reminded
me
of
a
weaker
lighter
version
of
genesee
cream
ale
for
the
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
id
entertain
drinking
this
if
i
had
something
productive
to
do
on
a
summer
afternoon
descent
flavor
and
low
abv
oh
get
your
favorite
aspirin
or
headache
medicine
ready
the
hangover
from
this
beer
is
nasty
it
tastes
of
corn
grain
about
even
with
sweet
and
bitter
both
lightly
done
easy
drinking
for
sure
while
its
cold
not
so
much
as
it
warms
up
a
decent
brew
to
have
on
a
hot
day
but
so
are
many
others
and
theres
the
odd
one
that
excels
i
like
their
cream
ale
more
i
would
choose
this
any
day
over
your
standard
budbud
lite
coors
lite
swill
if
your
in
the
mood
for
beer
but
are
on
a
budget
it
would
not
be
a
bad
choice
to
grab
a
few
of
these
its
too
sweet
and
has
too
little
hops
its
your
typical
not
very
good
american
lager
if
you
drink
it
with
a
good
beer
aftertaste
already
in
your
mouth
this
will
ruin
it
tastes
better
if
a
little
of
any
other
beer
is
left
in
the
glass
before
pouring
in
the
genny
me
and
jenny
were
like
peas
and
carrots
got
this
as
a
gag
extra
im
gagging
but
kind
of
enjoyed
the
experience
it
was
a
bit
funky
with
some
more
sweetness
than
a
bmc
i
dont
really
know
how
to
describe
this
other
than
a
funky
bmc
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
carbonated
and
left
quite
a
weird
sour
aftertaste
im
just
kind
of
confused
an
anemic
yellow
colored
brew
with
a
decent
white
head
that
quickly
shrivels
to
a
scant
breath
of
head
and
lacing
seems
generally
absent
the
aroma
indicates
classic
cereal
grains
with
an
accent
on
wheat
and
an
inference
of
some
light
lemon
not
all
that
bad
if
youre
thinking
in
terms
of
light
and
refreshing
the
flavor
brings
out
somewhat
watery
citrus
wheat
more
cereal
grain
and
its
not
offensive
in
my
estimation
but
its
clearly
a
drinker
for
the
driveway
and
burgers
a
light
refresher
with
a
peppery
idea
that
is
aided
by
a
lively
fine
carbonation
but
it
is
light
bodied
and
other
than
the
carbonation
its
pretty
much
watery
stuff
its
a
standard
cereal
brew
and
its
fine
to
pound
these
with
the
boys
but
clearly
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
if
you
want
to
truly
enjoy
a
tasty
beer
then
again
i
think
it
would
be
unamerican
to
be
without
some
of
these
traditional
lagers
that
can
go
down
like
well
water
owhat
you
would
expect
from
a
adjunct
but
honestly
genny
is
my
go
to
cheap
beer
much
rather
have
any
genny
beer
before
miller
or
coors
poured
extremely
vigorously
into
a
snifter
achieving
a
finger
of
white
head
zero
beading
smells
like
a
grain
belt
corn
lots
of
corn
a
bit
of
sugar
nothing
exciting
at
all
tastes
like
some
beer
that
someone
forgot
about
back
in
july
i
wouldnt
offer
this
beer
to
my
worst
enemy
seriously
this
sucks
all
beer
biases
aside
this
one
tastes
like
i
shouldnt
have
tasted
it
overall
like
most
adjunct
lagers
that
ive
had
its
isnt
particularly
bad
tasting
or
offensive
its
just
not
what
beer
should
be
and
definitely
not
something
i
would
pick
up
i
know
this
isnt
any
good
but
i
kind
of
dig
it
anyway
maybe
all
those
kegs
of
this
hillbilly
juice
in
my
youth
inoculated
me
against
its
fairly
noxious
taste
im
not
proud
of
it
but
i
can
drink
this
all
day
long
o
not
very
good
but
what
do
you
expect
rochester
represent
if
you
want
great
beer
from
rochester
try
three
heads
o
easy
to
drink
but
best
when
served
extremely
cold
would
be
a
great
beer
for
sitting
out
fishing
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
o
its
not
the
worst
beer
ever
in
fact
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
cans
at
a
bbq
on
a
hot
summer
day
to
quench
my
thirst
american
adjunct
lagers
have
their
place
if
you
want
to
experience
some
of
the
finer
brews
this
brewery
has
to
offer
go
for
dundee
dundee
beers
are
actually
pretty
good
comparable
to
craft
beers
especially
surprising
given
that
this
is
their
flagship
oin
western
ny
genny
is
not
as
beloved
as
some
other
regional
breweries
are
around
the
country
but
for
3
99
for
a
6
of
pounders
its
not
awful
better
than
most
things
from
bmc
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
below
average
for
the
style
overall
its
not
bad
for
the
style
but
its
not
very
good
either
there
just
wasnt
much
to
it
it
doesnt
compare
unfavorably
to
the
bmcs
of
the
world
though
i
much
prefer
their
cream
ale
myself
though
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
definitely
one
you
could
toss
back
and
finish
in
a
matter
of
minutes
the
body
is
about
average
for
an
aal
which
increases
the
drinkability
while
decreasing
the
flavor
profile
the
carbonation
is
actually
rather
weak
for
an
aal
and
is
barely
fizzy
overall
i
am
quite
surprised
by
this
beer
it
is
pretty
tasty
with
no
off
flavors
and
has
some
hoppyness
would
be
excellent
on
a
hot
day
one
of
the
better
aals
o
ugh
drain
pour
to
the
max
this
beer
is
just
not
good
at
all
gross
in
flavor
and
nose
i
would
most
definitely
not
want
to
experience
this
one
again
o
i
dont
usually
mind
genesee
brews
too
much
but
this
one
wasnt
for
me
i
picked
up
the
heritage
12
pack
today
of
genesse
today
at
portchester
beer
dist
great
place
to
go
to
get
beer
now
the
heritage
12
pack
comes
with
the
cream
ale
and
the
12
horse
ale
as
well
the
beer
is
good
better
than
some
of
the
other
adjunct
american
lagers
and
better
than
pabst
it
dosent
really
have
a
taste
to
it
but
most
american
adjunct
lagers
but
its
a
little
bit
sweeter
in
taste
overall
its
worth
trying
overall
average
for
a
standard
american
lager
at
only
8
for
a
12
pack
it
is
worth
the
price
a
good
beer
for
tailgating
and
massive
parties
where
you
dont
know
and
dont
care
to
know
most
of
the
people
there
i
cant
say
i
wont
have
some
of
this
around
for
nipping
at
when
im
workin
around
the
place
reviewed
blind
as
part
of
blind
bif
6
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
an
active
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comes
off
as
kinda
adjunct
lagerly
what
with
light
corn
lighter
wheat
and
dankish
grass
coming
through
a
small
tinge
of
what
seems
like
nutmeg
hangs
in
the
background
all
wallflowerly
and
whatnot
the
taste
runs
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
smell
but
without
that
spice
tinge
theres
a
flowery
crispness
to
the
finish
the
body
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
i
cant
say
as
i
truly
dislike
it
i
think
i
nothing
it
o
not
a
bad
beer
will
keep
some
of
this
in
stock
for
the
ones
in
my
life
that
dont
like
alot
of
flavor
in
their
beer
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
you
could
put
away
a
lot
of
these
ultimately
however
if
youre
looking
for
flavor
and
intricacies
go
elsewhere
o
for
an
adjunct
lager
its
not
the
worst
ive
had
as
long
as
this
beer
is
ice
cold
it
can
stand
up
against
its
brothers
o
i
like
some
aal
a
lot
this
is
terrible
point
blank
bad
no
nose
no
flavor
and
no
body
notes
this
is
an
average
cheap
blue
collarretro
beer
and
one
that
i
have
had
many
of
i
will
never
let
this
beer
touch
my
lips
again
the
last
time
i
drank
gensee
was
at
the
phish
festival
in
watkins
glen
this
past
summer
lets
just
say
that
they
probably
had
to
hose
down
the
portipoti
after
i
was
through
with
it
i
will
never
forgive
this
brewery
for
the
state
i
was
in
that
day
o
its
a
genny
man
what
did
you
expect
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
drinking
beers
notes
pretty
typical
adjunct
lager
not
overly
sweet
but
the
flavors
arent
great
nose
is
weak
its
cheap
and
not
horrible
so
i
will
get
it
for
nights
when
i
need
something
like
that
overall
just
what
you
would
expect
from
a
cheap
30
pack
of
cans
o
not
bad
for
a
cheap
lager
pretty
comparable
to
others
in
the
category
with
genesee
definitely
go
for
the
cream
ale
or
bock
over
this
one
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
to
be
very
flavorful
or
refreshing
basic
beer
good
any
time
you
need
a
change
of
pace
clear
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
white
foamy
but
short
lasting
head
very
bubbly
very
spotty
lacing
of
glass
taste
is
a
bit
watery
crispsomewhat
bland
neither
hoppy
nor
sweet
corn
flavor
is
apparent
really
disappointing
considering
that
their
cream
ale
is
to
die
for
overall
i
though
this
was
actually
pretty
good
for
the
style
it
had
a
nice
scent
and
the
taste
was
pretty
well
balanced
also
it
is
priced
very
reasonably
reviewed
from
notes
reviewed
here
for
the
first
time
after
many
tastings
over
the
years
poured
from
16oz
tall
boy
into
dimpled
glass
mug
for
the
purposes
of
this
review
as
i
normally
just
enjoy
it
from
the
can
pours
a
straw
colored
yellow
with
strong
carbonation
and
a
good
amount
of
head
topping
about
an
inch
in
height
obvious
smell
of
corn
and
sweet
sourdough
and
tastes
about
the
same
although
not
as
sweet
as
pbr
and
does
have
a
little
bitter
hop
in
the
the
finish
just
enough
to
leave
an
after
taste
though
nothing
to
offend
as
this
beer
is
made
for
sessions
and
hot
afternoons
better
then
the
bmc
stuff
imo
and
dirt
cheap
at
3
99
for
a
sixer
of
tall
boys
in
these
parts
or
13
99
for
a
30
pack
od
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
better
than
bmc
products
might
get
sick
of
them
but
the
price
is
right
look
this
beer
is
what
it
is
its
99
for
a
24
oz
can
and
it
beats
the
crap
out
of
bud
bud
light
mgd
coors
light
miller
light
or
the
ilk
it
reminds
me
of
the
great
old
midwestern
aals
like
schlitz
or
blatz
before
they
went
to
hell
its
not
as
good
as
coors
banquet
but
its
half
the
price
bottom
line
its
cheap
but
not
shitty
go
genesee
beer
othe
best
commercially
produced
adjunct
filled
beer
out
there
but
still
not
that
tasty
when
compared
to
some
real
beers
overall
im
very
pleased
and
find
this
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
no
bad
aftertaste
even
after
having
several
of
them
if
youre
on
a
tight
budget
and
cant
always
afford
a
craft
beer
definitely
give
genesee
beer
a
go
you
just
cant
go
wrong
for
13
99
for
a
30
pack
overall
it
looks
like
an
aal
smells
like
an
aal
but
tastes
a
little
better
than
one
i
personally
like
a
nice
change
up
for
ipas
and
belgian
ales
now
and
then
so
id
go
for
this
again
notes
14
years
in
rochester
and
this
is
my
1st
genny
this
easily
beats
any
bmc
product
overall
i
was
kind
of
surprised
by
this
one
but
boy
it
is
way
too
sweet
but
i
cant
complain
much
you
could
do
considerably
worse
i
am
drinking
this
hobostyle
out
of
a
bigass
can
replete
with
paper
bag
and
all
and
so
i
cannot
precisely
say
what
it
looks
like
so
ill
grant
it
a
score
of
average
if
the
look
is
like
the
aroma
then
an
average
score
is
generous
it
smells
like
bad
cheap
beer
sickly
sweet
grain
and
corn
alcohol
and
sweat
socks
but
perhaps
there
is
a
nostalgic
element
related
to
that
ungodly
combo
that
renders
it
better
than
horrible
the
flavor
is
more
inyourface
bad
with
the
same
elements
of
cheap
alcohol
corn
and
adjunct
dirty
grain
and
sweat
the
feel
is
about
average
overall
this
is
pretty
bad
stuff
o
this
is
an
oldtimers
brew
that
is
extremely
dirt
cheap
for
the
price
i
would
rather
have
it
over
bud
miller
or
coors
it
is
everything
i
expected
it
to
be
bland
vapid
and
overly
generic
the
can
even
looks
generic
like
something
out
of
an
old
health
book
that
is
just
a
white
can
with
black
print
that
reads
beer
i
think
we
could
all
use
a
little
more
genesee
every
now
and
again
btw
the
minimalist
can
design
is
a
stroke
of
genius
this
will
appeal
to
the
good
old
boys
and
the
hip
urban
dwellers
who
love
retro
stuff
good
thinking
genesee
golden
and
sudsy
with
lots
of
carbonation
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
smells
of
sugary
vegetable
and
grain
flavor
is
candied
grains
has
a
roasted
vegetable
aftertaste
good
flavor
for
this
style
and
it
gets
the
job
done
without
draining
your
wallet
overall
its
a
cheap
aal
not
the
worst
choice
especially
for
the
price
on
a
side
note
the
can
design
has
to
be
one
of
the
worst
ive
ever
seen
pours
a
clear
piss
colored
light
yellow
with
bubbly
2
finger
head
smells
of
grain
cornmeal
boiling
water
stale
fizz
is
fizz
a
scent
but
also
has
gentle
citrusy
lemon
on
top
of
the
sweet
malt
exactly
what
an
aal
should
smell
like
it
tastes
like
fucking
water
screams
a
man
in
the
crowd
im
not
sure
water
is
a
taste
but
it
sure
is
watered
down
sour
grains
sweet
lager
malts
slightly
offensive
on
the
after
taste
light
to
absent
in
body
and
feel
for
an
aal
i
guess
this
is
ok
but
will
undoubtably
be
the
last
time
it
touches
my
lips
what
was
i
thinking
a
little
dirty
but
the
cheapest
thing
i
can
find
now
since
the
gouging
went
into
full
effect
overall
i
will
never
ever
purchase
this
again
im
angry
i
wasted
my
money
on
a
6er
of
it
it
was
so
bad
the
worse
beer
i
can
say
that
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
has
a
c
rating
on
here
but
i
would
not
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
would
take
any
american
adjunctlight
beer
over
this
any
day
big
cheap
ass
can
from
habits
s
salem
99
cents
not
even
gonna
pour
this
the
can
is
different
than
the
one
showing
simple
red
genesee
logo
on
white
aroma
from
the
can
is
typical
cheap
corn
lager
taste
is
again
corn
slightly
sweet
and
semi
dry
to
be
honest
not
the
worst
mouthfeel
for
this
type
of
beer
nothing
greaqt
or
even
good
but
not
horrible
o
i
had
high
hopes
but
they
were
quickly
dashed
o
picked
up
for
0
93
per
24oz
can
which
now
boasts
the
retro
logo
i
have
downed
plenty
of
these
brews
in
my
days
at
rit
but
was
excited
to
see
it
down
here
in
fl
better
than
many
others
within
the
style
but
still
corny
o
better
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
of
the
same
style
the
good
ol
genny
this
was
the
first
and
only
time
ive
had
genny
beer
ive
had
their
other
brews
on
other
occasions
this
beer
was
poured
from
a
can
into
a
glass
at
a
steady
pace
the
head
billowed
and
settled
to
a
tiny
ring
around
the
glass
the
beer
smelled
much
like
it
tasted
kinda
on
te
sweet
side
but
had
enough
bitter
to
keep
it
balenced
drinkability
so
far
so
good
i
mean
i
think
id
rather
have
this
over
a
bunch
of
other
brands
beers
of
the
same
style
cant
say
id
turn
to
this
one
over
some
of
the
other
aals
but
at
89
cents
for
a
24oz
can
i
cant
really
complain
actually
yeah
i
guess
i
can
and
probably
wont
drink
another
any
time
soon
theres
better
cheap
crap
out
there
d
i
could
drink
the
amount
given
to
me
not
bad
stuff
and
to
all
the
haters
lighten
up
its
only
beer
not
everything
needs
to
be
over
the
top
ridiculously
maltyhoppy
high
in
alcohol
you
get
the
idea
its
beers
like
these
that
got
me
into
beer
to
begin
with
much
respect
enjoy
with
your
favorite
fast
food
meal
it
fits
right
in
any
true
beer
lovers
who
wish
to
take
a
break
from
those
hopmalt
bombs
shouldnt
have
any
problems
with
this
one
drinkability
is
fine
in
part
due
to
the
4
5
abv
good
hot
weather
beer
drank
this
after
3
or
4
pbrs
and
would
say
this
is
less
tasty
than
pbr
but
no
bad
flavors
and
the
low
abv
is
a
plus
when
drinking
multiples
good
beer
for
the
style
pours
a
nasty
sticky
looking
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
soapy
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
nasty
hop
extract
and
corn
tastes
of
sweet
corn
and
water
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
with
an
unpleasant
carbonation
drinkability
is
low
a
poor
beer
overall
stay
away
d
very
easy
to
rink
but
the
flavor
is
such
that
it
can
be
a
bit
challenging
to
down
a
lot
compared
to
most
adjunct
lagers
this
is
actually
pretty
good
but
that
doesnt
really
mean
much
consider
it
akin
to
a
first
place
loser
d
for
the
price
this
beats
almost
everything
else
it
was
stored
near
in
the
cooler
with
the
exception
of
yuengling
would
have
again
definitely
a
good
one
to
just
plop
some
change
down
for
and
get
buzz
on
out
of
a
can
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
pale
golden
color
the
one
finger
of
white
head
retained
poorly
and
left
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
corn
and
rice
adjuncts
on
top
of
a
pale
malt
background
the
flavors
were
classic
macrolager
adjunct
grains
hints
of
cardboard
dry
and
generic
malt
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
very
end
to
keep
it
crisp
better
than
budweiser
et
al
but
that
aint
sayin
much
forgettable
if
you
can
get
it
try
it
at
least
once
overall
a
basic
beer
ill
keep
this
on
hand
if
only
to
cook
with
has
a
low
abv
to
drink
id
go
with
the
ice
version
overall
this
was
different
than
i
expected
i
thought
it
would
at
least
taste
like
beer
i
should
have
known
after
looking
at
it
the
flavor
would
be
weak
but
i
never
expected
it
to
be
this
weak
i
would
hate
to
try
the
light
version
however
it
is
cheap
like
50
cents
a
can
and
the
can
is
really
old
school
drinkability
while
this
is
a
light
and
somewhat
refreshing
beer
its
overall
level
of
pleasantness
is
rather
low
i
brought
this
tailgating
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
it
was
universally
panned
i
dont
think
its
all
that
bad
but
it
is
far
from
my
favorite
cheap
lager
flavor
is
smooth
yet
subtle
offering
a
pleasant
feel
and
an
easy
drink
if
this
beer
met
bud
in
an
alley
it
would
kick
its
ass
all
over
town
and
come
up
smiling
d
good
for
a
regional
lager
beer
cant
beat
the
price
taste
is
pretty
good
grain
and
apple
with
light
apple
cider
hint
and
aftertaste
of
apple
and
grain
there
is
a
hint
of
grass
and
it
is
fairly
spritzy
feel
is
pretty
good
and
not
watery
although
basic
it
is
good
and
better
than
many
d
not
a
terrible
macro
definitely
better
than
bud
5
99
a
sixer
isnt
terrible
but
there
are
cheaper
and
tastier
options
if
youre
on
a
budget
drinkability
easy
to
salt
these
away
when
the
mercurys
up
not
much
to
recommend
these
really
other
than
their
nonoffensiveness
sometimes
though
thats
enough
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
sentimental
value
for
me
grew
up
watching
my
dad
and
his
friends
drink
this
kind
of
local
for
me
its
worth
a
shot
buying
this
due
to
its
really
cheap
price
to
me
its
better
than
most
of
your
big
name
macros
and
hey
you
cant
beat
the
price
one
of
the
cheapest
beers
i
know
of
rjt
although
the
thirty
pack
i
bought
was
in
the
cheap
beer
price
range
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
of
this
new
to
my
area
i
hope
it
sticks
around
as
it
would
definitely
be
welcome
in
my
rotation
of
cheap
lager
thirst
quenchers
overall
another
average
fyb
but
due
to
its
sentimental
value
it
gets
a
slightly
higher
score
from
me
what
the
hell
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
it
overall
just
a
typical
macro
nothing
special
relatively
drinkable
if
you
can
stand
drinking
something
with
so
little
flavor
i
personally
dont
want
a
lot
i
guess
its
not
horrible
but
i
sure
like
their
cream
ale
a
whole
lot
better
oh
i
did
not
think
highly
of
this
one
i
had
it
one
night
about
8
years
ago
in
college
and
i
still
remember
it
we
were
tricked
into
thinking
it
was
guinness
draft
for
a
dollar
its
just
a
cheap
beer
thats
not
as
popular
as
natural
or
busch
but
thats
what
i
would
compare
it
to
so
since
it
was
college
and
i
was
broke
we
ordered
several
of
these
and
im
very
surprised
i
remember
anything
from
that
night
among
be
better
macros
that
ive
had
despite
the
average
taste
and
adjunct
character
the
lacing
on
this
beer
compares
with
a
good
craft
beer
a
good
simple
food
or
when
you
just
need
a
cold
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
pepes
in
new
haven
if
youre
ever
there
its
a
must
it
seemed
like
to
perfect
time
to
review
this
genesee
after
running
on
a
warm
for
march
day
genesee
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
quickly
the
aroma
is
strongly
grainy
but
with
a
hint
of
bitter
herbal
hops
the
flavor
is
more
graininess
with
a
bit
of
cooked
corn
and
some
kind
of
astringent
bitterness
that
is
both
pleasant
and
unpleasant
the
finish
is
sweet
and
full
bodied
considering
the
lack
of
flavor
elsewhere
in
this
brew
overall
when
on
a
budget
i
wont
turn
this
beer
up
although
at
the
same
price
i
would
much
rather
the
bock
or
cream
ale
the
beer
that
made
rochester
famous
or
maybe
not
either
way
you
can
find
it
around
here
for
cheap
simply
because
its
made
in
the
state
its
not
a
bad
little
lawnmower
beer
pretty
standard
american
macro
fare
it
poured
a
light
yellow
minimal
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
straight
up
adjunct
its
an
average
beer
not
much
to
say
about
it
gun
to
my
head
i
probably
couldnt
pick
it
out
from
a
lineup
against
any
other
beer
in
the
style
notes
while
this
is
by
no
means
a
great
beer
for
what
it
is
and
the
competition
it
has
it
is
definitely
above
average
the
one
thing
i
hate
about
adjunct
lagers
is
that
gross
bizarre
sweetness
that
they
have
this
beer
doesnt
have
that
it
just
has
the
flavors
from
normal
malt
everything
everyone
else
says
is
true
but
theres
something
really
basic
about
this
beer
that
lifts
it
above
the
rest
interesting
how
theres
a
bit
of
a
cream
ale
vs
beer
issue
for
genesee
i
like
the
cream
ale
but
it
has
a
sweet
edge
i
could
do
without
i
wish
they
would
try
their
hand
at
a
more
sophisticated
brew
that
would
be
available
in
my
parts
downstate
ny
given
the
consolidation
among
beer
makers
over
the
past
5
years
mostly
resulting
in
ill
effects
on
quality
i
guess
i
want
to
find
a
decent
independent
i
can
hang
my
hat
on
this
comes
close
but
no
cigar
just
yet
drinkability
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head

without

some
notes
of

this

a
very
fresh
beer
that
fits
right
into
the
category
i
have
learned
to
expand
my
beer
taste
but
you
just
cant
beat
one
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
recommend
and
would
buy
again
pours
a
clear

1
finger
of
head
that
fades
quickly
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
smells
of

with
some
buttery
sweetness
ive
lived
in
rochester
for
28
years
and
have
never
had
this
before
and
given
all
the
horror
stories
ive
heard
about
genny
its
really
not
that
bad
the
front
end
is
fairly
bland
but
with
more
body
than
most
in
the
style
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
sweet
finish
thats
fairly
fast
and
clean

a
stale
odor
like
walking
into
the
r
r
tavern
when
i
delivered
newspapers
oof
mouthfeel
was
thin
without
much
flavor
it
was
lightly
sweet
with
the
cereal
quality
so
prevalent
in
the
style
finish
had
a
light
bitterness
but
nothing
worth
shouting
about
frankly
i
really
liked
genny
cream
as
a
kid
and
this
was
a
second
if
nothing
else
was
at
hand
not
much
has
changed

cereal

the

corn
most
notably
with
just
a
hint
of
citrussy
grassy
hops
tastes
sweet
with
cereal
grains
and
cooked
corn
initially
and
a
bit
more
hops
than
im
used
to
getting
from
the
style
expressing
themselves
mostly
as
a
grassy
citrussy
presence
toward
the
finish
finishes
clean
as
it
should
for
the
style
nothing
to
complex
or
profound
but
a
simple
easy
drinking
macrostyle
lager
thats
better
than
most
and
a
good
quaffable
brew
for
hot
summer
days
like
today
i
recommend
the
cream
ale
over
this
one
tm
the
mouthfeel
is
adequate
and
not
all
hat
watered
down
as
some
seem
to
think
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
with
a
slight
hint
of
dried
hops
i
like
it
a
bit
better
than
the
average
rating
calculated
by
ba
to
this
point
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
good
representation
of
style
i
suppose
this
beer
is
good
for
exactly
what
its
intended
to
be
which
is
an
inexpensive
and
poundable
beer
d
i
like
genny
a
lot
more
than
i
should
bland
corny
sweet
still
something
about
this
one
very
clean
and
pretty
refreshing
this
is
also
all
my
dad
drinks
so
maybe
theres
some
sort
of
residual
bias
whatever
not
bad
medium
light
body
with
medium
high
carbonation
keeps
things
refreshing
but
drinkability
is
hampered
by
an
excessive
slickness
coupled
with
the
unbalanced
sweetness
really
not
at
all
bad
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
better
than
most
of
the
big
brands
out
there
this
beer
isnt
setting
any
records
or
braking
any
molds
but
it
has
been
around
for
a
long
time
and
it
pretty
much
sums
up
the
catagory
it
belongs
in
it
is
a
golden
american
lager
crisp
clean
refreshing
it
has
more
flavor
than
most
of
the
others
in
the
style
in
that
style
and
goes
very
well
with
lunch
or
if
your
in
the
mood
for
something
easy
drinking
very
good
beer
and
a
good
price
harder
to
find
now
in
southern
teir
ny
genny
cream
is
very
good
too
but
cant
find
it
anymore
ontap
too
bad
most
people
drink

very
easy
to
drink
this
is
just
an
ordinary
macro
not
much
different
than
the
others
on
a
hot
summer
day
genesee
really
does
hit
the
spot
a
friend
of
mine
owns
a
campground
in
upstate
new
york
and
once
we
run
out
of
homebrew
and
the
good
stuff
this
is
it
that
normally
means
that
by
saturday
afternoon
were
sitting
around
a
smoldering
fire
with
a
can
of
genesee
in
our
hands
and
you
know
what
that
works
fine
for
me
theres
a
time
and
place
for
every
beer
and
i
think
for
completely
relaxing
and
doing
nothing
this
is
just
fine
its
a
basic
golden
lager
its
wellmade
it
could
use
a
little
more
maltiness
and
a
little
more
hop
flavor
but
its
really
just
fine
as
it
is
there
are
no
flaws
to
it
and
its
an
easydrinking
gently
hopped
clean
golden
lager
and
thats
my
review
im
not
going
to
go
into
the
clarity
color
aroma
and
so
forth
because
i
dont
think
its
really
necessary
if
you
need
that
check
out
my
review
of
genny
cream
ale
and
theyre
not
really
that
dissimilar
the
cream
ale
has
some
nice
fruitiness
a
little
more
maltiness
and
appears
less
bitter
if
you
see
it
though
get
some
it
will
help
you
relive
your
early
beer
tasting
years
this
was
litterally
the
lawnmower
beer
for
me
i
mowed
the
lawn
then
popped
the
tab
on
the
can
of
genesee
i
did
manage
to
find
a
glass
for
the
beer
rather
than
chugging
straight
from
the
can
in
hindsight
the
straightcan
method
would
have
kept
me
from
feeling
pretentious
about
the
beer
quite
fizzy
and
straw
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
head
retention
was
fair
but
efforvescent
aromas
of
partmalt
partgrain
first
took
hold
while
german
hops
sulfer
fruitiness
and
cereal
grains
follows
up
flavors
bring
in
the
maltgrain
balance
but
the
hops
fell
behind
allowing
the
sulfurs
esters
and
a
light
vegitable
character
to
gain
strength
a
carbonation
prickle
lifts
the
beer
off
the
toung
and
is
perhaps
its
saving
grace
the
beer
is
quite
thin
astringent
and
grainy
otherwise
finishes
with
apples
pears
and
a
light
corn
flavor
late
not
the
best
beer
out
there
but
not
a
drainpour
either
pours
a
bit
darker
than
the
average
macro
lager
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
as
it
drops
the
nose
is
slightly
grainy
with
some
light
hoppyearthy
scents
the
taste
comes
through
with
some
understated
caramel
malt
sweetness
that
teases
the
taste
budsbut
never
delivers
anything
more
than
any
other
cheap
lagera
small
amount
of
hop
dryness
is
a
nice
touchbut
too
little
too
late
could
be
a
sessionable
brewbut
it
really
lacks
creativity
genesee
out
of
the
keg
was
the
beer
of
choice
among
my
pals
up
in
cleveland
back
in
the
day
a
keg
or
two
would
accompany
a
weekly
cook
out
so
i
have
many
fond
yet
cloudy
memories
with
this
beer
tonight
i
grabbed
a
30
pack
for
the
heck
of
it
as
i
am
drinking
one
right
now
i
can
honestly
say
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
cheap
stand
by
which
happens
to
be
strohs
this
beer
is
unusually
smooth
and
has
a
really
good
finish
compared
to
most
american
mainstream
beers
my
only
wish
is
that
the
frothy
head
that
is
immediately
present
once
poured
into
a
glass
would
stick
around
for
a
bit
longer
all
in
all
i
cant
complain
poured
a
light
gold
that
was
seethru
and
a
small
head
that
died
quickly
metallic
smell
due
to
the
can
some
faint
hops
with
a
grassy
tone
a
smooth
beer
not
harsh
like
other
cheap
beers
that
has
some
faint
hoppy
notes
on
the
tongue
rather
bland
and
weak
but
agreeable
and
not
disgusting
i
could
have
another
this
beer
was
in
my
recession
refreshin
beer
group
with
other
sub
10
a
12pack
beers
it
starts
out
ok
but
after
a
few
you
really
begin
to
taste
the
corny
alcohol
flavor
which
just
isnt
good
easy
enough
to
drink
but
this
is
a
quite
boring
beer
mild
and
nonoffending
sum
this
up
best
for
this
style
of
beer
the
appearance
is
slightly
darker
still
very
typical
the
smell
has
some
adjuctscorn
but
not
offensive
the
taste
is
smooth
with
more
character
than
the
average
american
lager
highly
drinkable
great
smooth
taste
crispnice
carbonation
can
be
used
to
wash
down
wings
during
the
super
bowl
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
low
abv
was
nice
for
the
next
morning
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
and
purchase
but
for
the
atmosphere
like
the
american
legion
with
old
school
fellas
this
one
will
do
overall
very
typical
of
an
american
style
lager
no
flavor
or
smell
with
an
emphasis
on
trying
to
intoxicate
i
wouldnt
offer
this
to
anyone
but
my
worst
enemies
its
abysmal
and
it
still
shocks
me
to
see
so
many
old
hands
from
my
neck
of
the
woods
who
still
drink
this
swill
dont
try
ever
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
head
that
starts
out
amply
and
fades
aroma
is
light
thin
and
corny
a
bit
sweet
too
typical
of
the
style
taste
is
not
too
bad
though
some
alcoholic
aftertaste
with
sweetness
nothing
really
impressive
what
it
does
have
going
for
it
is
that
its
inoffensive
easy
to
drink
and
cheap
i
would
just
give
it
an
average
rating
still
much
higher
than
my
opinion
on
a
few
other
macros
its
a
rather
bland
cheap
beer
that
might
do
in
a
pinch
while
sitting
at
the
pool
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
thats
about
it
id
support
this
beer
especially
for
the
cheap
price
tag
but
also
because
they
are
not
one
of
the
big
three
and
dont
use
all
their
money
for
advertising
genny
is
a
classic
that
i
would
highly
recommend
if
you
like
this
style
and
i
do
it
wasnt
even
ice
cold
when
i
drank
a
couple
today
i
couldnt
wait
any
longer
and
it
still
was
very
smooth
and
yummy
finish
was
ohso
clean
and
left
no
aftertaste
at
all
very
clean
and
fresh
beer
props
to
high
falls
for
this
american
classic
i
hope
its
around
forever
and
im
really
glad
i
rediscovered
it
i
think
its
gonna
be
my
new
everyday
brew
if
youre
a
bud
or
miller
regular
give
this
a
try
and
tell
me
honestly
that
this
isnt
just
as
good
or
better
better
in
my
opinion
cheers
my
friends
cheers
genny
beer
is
far
better
than
b
m
or
c
and
as
a
macro
lager
its
really
pretty
darn
good
a
great
cheap
beer
and
perfect
for
camping
genesee
beer

to
particularly
recommend
it

than
low
price
though
karst
i
bought
a
12
pack
of
genny
cans
today
havent
had
any
in
maybe
30
years
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
wondered
why
i
took
so
long
to
come
back
to
our
local
brewer
big
head
left
a
little
lacing
a
slightly
sweet
taste
and
smell
and
a
toasty
aftertaste
which
i
had
completely
forgotten
about
over
the
years
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
after
the
pour
goes
good
with
food
especially
with
a
local
delicacy

taste
is
refreshing
with
some
adjunct
malt
being
noticeable
but
not
overly
and
dont
ruined
the
beer
hops
level
is
very
low
and
not
discernable
overall
this
is
another
bland
lager
without
any
flaw
or
any
complexity
either
as
far
as
macros
go
this
is
maybe
one
of
the
best
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
this
is
actually
very
good
its
one
of
those
products
that
doesnt
pretend
to
be
anything
other
than
what
it
actually
is
a
decent
macro
yes
its
kind
of
sweet
but
not
in
a
bad
or
sickening
way
it
really
does
a
lot
to
wet
things
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
a
full
flavored
beer
and
it
seems
to
go
well
with
just
about
any
food
afterwards
ive
never
had
any
negative
things
happening
as
far
as
headaches
or
digestive
system
problems
in
my
opinion
it
has
the
standard
brews
from
the
big
three
beaten
by
a
mile
and
it
costs
less
as
well
pours
a
vibrant
gold
with
a
very
large
white
pillowy
slowlydiminishing
head
thats
leaves
plenty
of
thick
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
lightly
sweet
with
grainy
malts
some
cooked
corn
and
no
detectable
hop
aromas
the
flavor
is
mild
but
not
terrible
for
an
obvious
adjunctheavy
lager
though
light
the
malt
flavor
that
is
there
is
pleasant
and
is
accompanied
by
some
yeast
and
a
very
light
touch
of
citrus
on
the
short
finish
it
has
a
thin
body
watery
texture
and
lively
carbonation
not
one
ill
be
having
again
anytime
soon
but
you
can
do
far
worse
this
wasnt
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
though
i
guess
its
easy
to
be
impressed
when
you
have
low
expectations
beats
the
hell
outta
most
other
macros
and
anything
bmc
has
ever
kicked
out
pours
out
to
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
head
that
dissipates
over
time
a
thin
layer
of
foam
is
left
over
the
beers
surface
some
minute
traces
of
lace
smell
is
weak
with
only
hints
of
adjunct
and
leathery
notes
taste
is
acceptable
grain
corn
mild
malt
and
some
hops
all
have
a
moment
with
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
a
lager
mild
and
smooth
a
decent
level
of
drinkability
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
either
if
i
was
gonna
drink
cheap
beer
at
a
hockey
game
or
at
the
bar
during
quarter
beer
night
this
would
be
a
good
choice
a
definite
step
over
most
macros
worth
a
try
i
live
in
rochester
how
can
i
give
this
a
bad
review
oh
allright
i
will
be
fair
actually
i
do
love
high
falls
brewing
but
this
is
one
of
the
weaker
ones
but
for
3
99
a
six
pack
bottles
it
still
is
a
good
deal
not
as
good
a
deal
as
genesee
red
or
genny
cream
ale
though
this
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
huge
airy
head
wsome
lacing
the
smell
is
unfortunately
a
little
chemically
but
also
sorta
malty
hoppy
but
most
of
all
corny
the
taste
is
grainy
yet
smooth
and
clean
malty
also
the
drinkability
is
average
i
would
rather
drink
this
though
over
a
bud
anyday
this
beer
should
be
bigger
than
it
is
respect
the
rock
it
was
a
straw
pale
yellow
color
with
a
nice
size
head
of
foam
on
it
it
smelled
a
bit
like
apple
juice
with
some
grains
it
the
taste
was
that
of
some
grains
that
were
watered
down
not
so
much
watered
down
like
some
other
beers
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
grainy
this
what
you
would
expect
for
a
macro
this
would
make
an
ok
cheap
session
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
abundant
white
foamy

is
slightly
sweet
and
not

else

only
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
little

or
hops

to
use

an

lager
that
just
about
says
it
all
dont
you
think
in

the

its

drinkable
in

pinch
and
is
marginally
better
than
the
national
brands
swill
it
aint
but
its
within
sniffing
distance
around
here
you
either
love
it
or
hate
it
it
pours
a
nice
golden
colorwith
a
good
amount
of
head
full
flavor
with
no
bad
after
taste
refreshing
but
not
too
light
i
would
take
it
over
a
bud
any
day
no
rice
or
other
fillers
either
3

for
a
six
pack
of
bottles
you
cant
go
wrong
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
small
head
little
retention
a
grain
malt
scent
with
a
similiar
taste
not
much
lacing
or
carbonation
below
average
taste
with
below
average
drinkability
combine
to
make
a
below
average
beer
but
its
cheap
so
if
you
are
just
interested
in
getting
drunk
on
a
budget
genesee
isnts
the
worst
choice
but
close
been
drinking
this
swill
for
years
and
love
it
hope
it
stays
arround
as
long
as
i
do
this
beer
has
a
clean
crisp
taste
holds
a
good
head
and
most
important
after
pounding
genny
all
nite
you
wake
up
with
no
hangoverso
get
30
and
go
for
it
your
boss
will
think
you
had
pepsi
all
nite
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
one
of
these
it
was
last
year
some
time
in
the
summer
at
some
parish
picnic
or
firemens
bazzar
anyway
if
you
do
try
this
youd
better
hope
that
genny
who
is
here
is
a
nurse
you
also
better
hope
shes
packing
some
immodium
every
time
i
drink
this
i
get
the
shits
every
time
at
least
the
brewing
process
is
consistent
if
youre
constipated
have
one
otherwise
stay
away
unless
of
course
theres
no
one
in
the
line
waiting
to
use
the
restroom
and
you
feel
the
need
for
a
good
bowel
cleansing
overallvirtually
a
clone
of
bud
only
even
cleaner
and
blander
if
your
cheap
pick
this
up
sometime
instead
of
bud
and
see
what
you
think
if
you
dont
like
bud
then
dont
even
bother
with
this
product
drinkability
im
only
drinking
this
because
my
brother
left
some
in
my
fridge
and
i
just
wanted
a
beer
any
beer
i
would
never
actively
seek
this
out
i
imagine
the
hangover
to
be
nasty
and
the
taste
is
awful
how
people
can
put
stuff
like
this
above
budweiser
is
beyond
me
although
bud
is
certainly
not
good
beer
its
at
least
a
notch
above
this
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
with
a
dry
yet
slightly
fruity
lager
yeast
aroma
it
is
clean
and
crisp
the
taste
is
average
it
is
virtually
devoid
of
any
real
flavor
besides
the
weak
pale
malt
taste
it
is
full
of
adjuncts
and
a
dry
lager
yeast
finish
the
goes
down
easy
but
is
quite
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
adjunct
lager
it
has
little
complexity
but
it
drinks
well
if
youre
going
to
buy
yellow
beer
buy
something
thats
not
going
to
go
to
keep
bud
controlling
everything

i
am
buying
this
more
in
the
can
because
its
a
decent
cheap
beverage
although
i
still
prefer
the
red
or
pbr
i
gotta
say
when
ice
cold
this
hits
the
cheapspot
i
have
had
bad
beers
in
my
day
but
i
had
the
misfortune
of
trying
this
it
was
in
my
friends
stepdads
frige
i
was
so
used
to
seeing
budlight
i
noticed
something
different
he
said
his
buddy
brought
it
down
from
new
york
eager
to
have
a
beer
other
than
budzepherhills
light
i
asked
if
he
would
mind
if
i
had
one
to
my
misfortune
he
said
sure
that
it
wasnt
available
here
only
up
north
seemed
hermless
enough
but
the
first
taste
was
putred
horrable
disgusting
taste
couldent
even
finish
it
got
half
way
and
dumped
it
and
went
for
the
bud
if
its
better
than
bud
its
got
to
be
bad
nearly
imposable
to
drink
it
pours
a
very
light
yellow
color
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
looks
disappointingly
thin
the
beer
presents
a
wispy
white
head
that
forms
just
a
little
lace
the
taste
is
adjunct
heavymore
corn
taste
than
malt
still
it
was
satisfying
its
clean
crisp
and
has
a
pleasant
lightly
mustyhop
finish
body
is
definitely
light
almost
watery
i
can
say
that
i
was
disappointed
but
not
extremely
so
still
ill
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
im
sure
the
dude
would
abide
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
genesee
never
boasts
of
superior
hops
or
malts
it
has
never
aimed
for
greatness
its
just
an
all
around
good
beer
in
its
rawest
form
i
must
put
this
beer
into
context
before
i
review
it
when
staying
at
my
inlaws
i
always
enjoy
the
ability
to
walk
to
a
bar
there
is
a
workingclass
bar
that
i
always
hit
up
it
is
ten
blocks
away
and
they
have
genny
on
tap
the
beer
decent
to
look
at
the
head
is
one
finger
and
stays
for
most
of
the
beer
the
color
is
yellow
but
not
overly
clear
it
seems
to
have
some
body
the
smell
is
of
corn
and
some
light
hops
the
taste
is
okay
for
a
pale
lager
there
is
definitely
corn
but
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
tasting
drinkability
of
course
is
up
to
the
drinker
sometimes
it
is
quite
drinkable
in
that
little
workingclass
bar
in
western
pennsylvania
wow
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
while
in
western
ny
at
my
wifes
hometown
local
barone
of
the
worse
beers
i
had
had
in
some
time
poures
a
fizzy
yellow
color
with
almost
no
headnot
much
smell
what
there
is
is
very
unpleasant
almost
skunky
taste
is
awful
something
sour
hits
ya
right
as
it
enters
the
mouth
than
fades
to
this
watery
fizzy
tasting
mass
incredably
bad
will
never
even
think
about
getting
this
again
in
the
world
of
genny
products
ill
stick
with
the
cream
ale
or
red
over
this
one
or
if
still
in
the
mood
for
a
cheap
beer
get
one
of
the
old
standbys
pabst
strohs
or
schlitz
they
always
seem
to
do
the
trick
when
moneys
tight
appears
filtered
clear
golden
with
a
white
fizzy
head
including
nice
scattered
webs
of
lacing
across
my
faceted
mug
aroma
is
light
sweetness
definitely
some
adjuncts
present
with
a
slight
touch
of
hops
clean
overall
taste
contains
a
crisp
rolling
gingery
sweet
not
bad
but
decent
bland
but
solid
flavor
balanced
and
cheap
and
better
than
most
macros
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
but
not
thin
there
some
decent
fluffy
texture
here
from
the
carbonation
drinkability
well
much
better
beer
exists
but
i
would
still
settle
for
this
over
most
macros
like
i
said
a
cheap
high
quantity
type
brew
12
oz
can
i
grew
up
on
this
stuff
and
have
to
admit
i
still
enjoy
a
few
whenever
i
make
it
home
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
moderate
head
that
recedes
quickly
aroma
of
the
malt
and
maybe
the
adjunts
good
carbonation
and
for
me
that
familiar
genny
taste
i
admit
its
a
little
lacking
in
any
real
body
or
depth
but
still
a
good
all
night
session
beer
this
is
another
of
the
many
pale
lagers
that
have
done
a
better
job
than
the
majors
in
everything
but
the
marketing
not
a
bad
effort
a
decent
lager
beer
the
malt
nose
is
joined
by
a
pleasant
grain
taste
that
indicates
both
barley
and
corn
decent
enough
straw
color
with
the
standard
white
head
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
great
beer
pale
gold
highly
carbonated
with
moderate
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
corn
aroma
mixed
with
a
bland
hop
smell
gristy
corn
taste
that
lingers
sort
of
bittersour
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lingering
due
to
the
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
does
not
aspire
to
be
great
it
simply
aims
to
be
drinkable
as
far
as
that
goes
this
is
actually
a
very
pleasant
beer
dont
waste
time
trying
to
find
any
complexity
to
the
flavor
softly
sweet
almost
a
touch
of
honey
malt
with
a
bit
sour
finish
is
all
you
will
find
but
pair
this
with
some
sharp
cheddar
and
crackers
and
it
wont
get
in
the
way
this
is
a
pretty
brew
but
it
wont
put
out
very
nice
mid
golden
colour
and
pours
a
nice
head
which
disapates
to
a
wide
ring
around
the
glass
however
the
taste
is
hollow
certainly
lacking
and
is
bitter
and
lingering
this
to
me
constitutes
a
limited
occasion
beer
limited
to
those
visitors
of
yours
that
you
do
not
want
to
return
since
that
time
small
lakes
canadian
imported
and
craft
brewed
beer
has
flowed
over
this
tired
palate
ya
know
what
genny
tastes
good
to
me
you
have
to
come
from
the
right
frame
of
reference
i
believe
you
yanks
are
too
hard
on
yourselves
when
it
comes
to
grading
the
local
commercial
sudz
this
gennesee
reminded
me
of
a
traditional
local
brewed
american
lager
from
a
time
when
the
local
breweries
cared
and
had
to
make
their
smaller
batches
consistantly
better
than
the
mega
brewers
to
keep
alive
id
give
this
new
offering
from
high
falls
an
overall
3
5
for
focusing
on
the
traditional
repeatable
quality
of
the
regional
american
brewer
before
the
70s
corporate
shitstorm
made
national
brands
taste
different
depending
on
where
you
bought
them
long
live
genny
if
the
cream
ale
was
not
enough
we
have
this
offering
bland
devoid
of
any
taste
this
would
make
a
good
stadium
beer
that
is
to
say
if
you
spill
a
cup
of
this
you
arent
going
to
lose
any
sleep
maybe
it
was
the
can
maybe
it
was
the
beer
i
was
faced
by
a
lack
of
options
at
a
party
so
i
though
id
give
it
a
try
i
poured
some
into
a
glass
exposing
the
light
color
and
releasing
some
funky
aromas
the
first
sip
was
ok
but
after
i
swallowed
all
kinds
of
bad
flavors
appeared
i
tried
it
straight
from
the
can
a
few
times
with
no
luck
i
hated
to
dump
a
beer
but
i
couldnt
drink
it
so
i
picked
up
a
rock
whats
this
rock
light
i
thought
rolling
rock
was
a
light
beer
a
review
for
a
later
time
a
very
bland
beer
not
impressed
at
all
it
is
light
in
color
with
a
nice
head
with
tightly
packed
bubbles
first
taste
if
of
a
fizzy
malt
rush
with
slight
hoppy
overtones
goes
down
pretty
smooth
but
the
simplicity
of
the
brew
quickly
annoys
you
finishes
with
a
heavy
adjunct
aftertaste
this
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
and
had
absolutely
no
head
and
thereby
creating
no
lace
it
had
an
aroma
of
hops
and
grain
the
flavor
was
weakly
of
hops
and
mostly
of
grain
the
finish
had
an
incredible
amount
of
bite
to
it
i
drank
this
back
in
my
poor
college
days
glad
i
am
a
working
stiff
now
so
i
can
avoid
beer
such
as
this
notes
beats
bud
hands
down
imo
comparable
to
other
american
lagers
of
the
sort
sadly
this
beer
is
not
as
big
as
either
of
the
big
three
macro
beers
of
the
us
this
is
one
of
the
better
macrobrewed
american
lagers
clean
and
flavorful
pretty
good
brew
recommend
it
a
smooth
beer
with
a
nice
clear
appearance
this
is
an
easy
inoffensive
brew
that
will
do
when
required
a
decent
beer
if
you
are
just
hanging
with
some
buds
good
with
a
few
sunflower
seeds
at
a
hot
baseball
game
overall
this
is
a
macro
but
a
really
good
macro
to
me
i
prefer
this
beer
in
bottles
and
i
hear
quite
often
the
cans
have
a
metallic
aftertaste
try
a
bottle
and
see
what
you
think
love
the
taste
and
easy
to
drink
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
this
works
for
me
poured
two
fingers
frothy
head
fair
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
head
maintains
a
film
all
the
way
down
very
light
golden
color
very
clear
light
banana
aroma
not
picking
up
much
else
not
very
flavorful
tastes
like
a
decent
balance
of
sugar
and
bitterness
also
tasting
banana
but
not
much
else
very
straightforward
much
expected
from
a
large
brewery
feels
watery
and
lacks
any
grit
or
tack
almost
oily
quality
overall
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
in
complexity
i
like
to
keep
some
in
fridge
for
when
i
want
to
catch
a
buzz
but
can
no
longer
appreciate
a
more
decent
beer
boo
for
use
of
gmo
corn
but
cant
expect
much
else
from
cheap
beer
at
least
it
doesnt
give
me
a
headache
like
other
macrobrews
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
its
light
refreshing
and
tastes
like
a
good
beer
its
not
overpriced
i
just
coors
would
push
it
more
around
here
philadelphia
it
isnt
commonly
found
in
bars
and
restaurants
coors
light
is
literally
everywhere
coors
is
just
awful
imho
one
of
the
better
macros
very
smooth
and
quaffable
very
good
beer
out
of
this
category
great
taste
and
rounded
out
body
tastes
like
what
you
dreamed
coors
light
should
taste
like
good
summer
beer
in
a
poor
drink
a
lot
kinda
way
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
2
625
not
wretched
and
decent
for
bmc
standards
better
than
high
life
not
as
good
as
bud
commercial
and
consistent
cheap
beer
has
its
time
and
place
85
of
the
time
im
going
to
drink
craft
the
other
15
this
beer
is
my
go
to
nasty
nasty
nasty
nasty
nasty
i
dont
know
why
i
avoided
the
banquet
beer
for
so
long
this
is
the
smoothest
american
macro
of
the
bunch
great
taste
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
pleasant
aftertaste
maybe
coors
is
on
to
something
with
this
one
this
is
a
great
goto
beer
much
better
than
coors
light
i
admit
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
a
slight
sweet
aroma
and
taste
which
is
refreshing
with
little
bitterness
not
bad
for
a
macro
brew
pale
lager
a
perfect
example
of
a
fine
american
beer
i
think
the
main
problem
i
have
is
it
has
a
sweet
flavor
with
a
metallic
finish
i
guess
thats
all
you
need
to
know
you
know
coors
is
for
whores
decent
old
school
macro
lager
grainy
full
of
adjuncts
but
classic
better
then
bud
but
thats
like
being
the
tallest
midget
better
than
miller
busch
or
budweiser
but
not
much
else
typical
grainy
mass
brewed
north
american
beer
with
no
hops
at
all
nothing
exciting
or
exceptional
crystal
clear
golden
wellcarbonated
body
with
a
white
head
sweet
corn
grain
bread
and
lightly
fruity
nose
taste
light
bodied
clean
exactly
what
you
expect
from
american
adjunct
lager
style
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
body
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
are
scrubbed
of
anything
interesting
except
for
a
hint
of
grain
and
chemlab
memories
flavors
of
light
grain
and
a
touch
of
chamomile
are
weak
and
sheepish
feels
light
and
crisp
its
mouthfeel
being
its
most
redeeming
quality
o
when
looking
at
this
beer
from
a
background
of
craft
beer
coors
is
about
as
low
as
you
can
get
it
is
uninteresting
in
about
every
aspect
despite
that
crutch
its
non
offensive
and
thats
the
point
its
a
beer
for
the
masses
its
a
crisp
and
clean
taste
that
is
extremely
refreshing
not
bad
on
new
years
eve
splash
thin
and
watery
no
body
never
understood
the
mystique
when
it
was
unavailable
east
of
the
mississippi
overall
its
a
2
00
terrible
i
am
not
sure
why
but
coors
has
a
mystique
for
this
canadian
kid
i
clearly
remember
what
a
big
deal
it
was
when
coors
came
to
alberta
in
the
1980s
for
whatever
reason
it
disappeared
until
the
last
couple
of
years
it
amazes
me
that
people
pay
nearly
30
for
a
dozen
banquets
in
alberta
for
a
mass
produced
lager
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
it
looks
like
beer
smells
like
a
vegetable
garden
and
has
a
surprisingly
refreshing
taste
this
batch
cost
me
21
for
a
30
pack
so
im
planning
to
make
it
last
for
the
rest
of
the
month
a
coors
a
day
keeps
the
doctor
away
for
a
macro
brew
this
holds
its
own
with
a
crisp
taste
that
doesnt
feel
as
watered
down
as
other
24
pack
contemporaries
in
the
grocery
aisle
it
would
complement
a
cheeseburger
on
a
hot
day
drinkable
mildly
strong
lager
slightly
smooth
and
curry
straight
up
water
an
all
time
classic
just
a
plain
beer
from
a
big
brewer
this
is
what
people
should
drink
instead
of
coors
light
or
bud
overall
an
average
beer
nothing
special
but
not
anything
i
would
turn
down
i
will
not
seek
this
out
but
if
it
is
all
i
can
get
ill
take
it
not
to
shabby
liked
it
heaps
i
think
this
beer
is
very
common
like
drinking
bad
tasting
water
hands
down
the
worst
choice
in
the
isle
my
main
beer
good
ol
rocky
mountain
koolaid
best
beer
in
my
eyes
i
drink
my
craft
and
many
micros
but
this
is
my
main
beer
of
choice
and
always
will
be
this
and
coors
light
or
coors
extra
gold
any
of
those
3
this
is
the
most
flavorful
aal
out
of
the
whole
bunch
crisp
lightly
bittered
and
not
too
lean
coors
has
just
enough
personality
to
keep
things
interesting
though
there
are
many
derisive
stories
of
its
manufacturing
process
while
it
surely
takes
a
slammin
from
the
craft
community
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
brew
delivers
oceans
of
decent
thirst
quenching
beer
enjoyment
at
a
fearless
price
point
certainly
one
of
the
better
mass
macros
out
there
nothing
no
body
precious
little
flavor
highly
worthless
beer
would
never
buy
dont
get
me
started
on
coors
light
complete
garbage
yup
its
beer
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
aal
light
golden
color
and
a
fleeting
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
grains
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
decent
enough
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
and
a
very
clean
neutral
finish
great
after
cutting
the
yard
and
raking
leaves
on
a
warm
fall
day
overall
its
fine
i
mean
thats
the
goal
of
all
the
macro
beers
to
be
the
same
all
the
time
its
good
and
its
available
and
i
buy
it
when
i
dont
want
to
blow
the
beer
budget
on
craft
i
buy
it
but
i
dont
feel
that
good
about
it
lol
a
good
taste
and
flavor
for
what
it
is
so
overall
would
recommend
it
damn
yes
this
would
be
my
first
beer
to
go
much
better
than
those
over
beer
who
have
5
abv
the
price
tag
is
a
bit
high
compare
to
budweiser
or
others
i
would
give
a
45
if
the
price
was
a
bit
lower
but
anyways
still
a
fantastic
beer
go
grab
a
pack
if
you
can
i
bet
you
you
won
t
be
disappointed
pleasant
memories
aside
rating
coors
against
craft
beers
would
not
be
a
fair
comparison
but
among
other
similar
tasting
american
adjunct
lagers
coors
is
a
3
star
just
okay
beer
no
better
no
worse
its
just
okay
you
can
always
relax
with
an
ice
cold
coors
easily
accessible
my
local
store
has
deals
on
them
weekly
not
my
first
choice
in
beer
but
if
im
on
a
budget
its
no
doubt
my
pick
of
the
litter
when
i
was
younger
in
upstate
ny
we
used
to
kill
to
get
enough
for
a
six
pack
lol
not
bad
if
you
got
no
better
beer
when
it
comes
to
getting
a
sixer
at
the
local
grocer
or
gas
station
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
coors
banquet
overall
not
all
that
good
but
at
the
same
time
theres
nothing
really
offensive
about
it
if
im
going
cheap
ill
look
elsewhere
but
wouldnt
turn
down

great
tasting
beer
its
very
smooth
the
kind
you
can
drink
all
day
edit
even
a
few
nights
later
the
aluminum
pints
are
still
impressing
me
i
knocked
it
down
a
couple
micro
points
but
barely
this
brew
is
downright
impressive
with
this
serving
style
this
beer
is
okay
its
not
my
favorite
but
its
the
most
likely
beer
that
you
can
have
around
at
a
party
with
all
your
friends
that
everyone
will
like
other
beers
you
could
probably
serve
at
your
party
miller
lite
budweiser
some
regional
macro
beer
pbr
in
certain
company
its
just
an
all

aokay
beer
o
this
isnt
too
bad
for
what
it
is
id
drink
it
again
if
the
timing
and
price
was
right
i
guess
i
am
just
a
lover
of
coors
best
aal
in
my
opinion
drink
these
all
the
time
tastes
stronger
than
the
light
version
its
refreshing
at
the
pay
lake
and
always
something
i
keep
around
i
love
the
taste
of
this
i
enjoy
these
good
refreshing

an

abv
tried
and
true
wonder
coors
banquet
is
my
flagship
east
or
west
of
the
rockies
this
beer
was
ok
it
was
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
me
it
made
me
feel
full
i
do
not
know
why
it
just
did
it
had
a
strong
aroma
to
it
as
well
their
was
a
decent
amount
of
head
to
this
beer
as
well
it
was
a
decent
beer
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
though
can
you
sit
on
the
beach
and
drink
it
all
day
yes
nothing
special
going
on
foam
is
weak
and
dissipates
very
quickly
mouth
feel
is
weak
flavor
is
subtle
but
not
objectionable
appearance
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
a
little
deeper
than
bud
not
bad
for
when
i
want
a
light
tasting
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
for
a
fairly
cheap
drink
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
good
this
was
i
love
this
beer
the
way
it
used
to
be
made
could
drink
it
all
night
long
doesnt
even
compare
to
most
cheap
beers
in
its
class
if
your
starved
for
cash
this
stuff
wont
let
you
down
and
if
but
the
throwback
1939
bottles
you
wont
even
have
to
talk
to
the
hot
women
they
will
talk
to
you
a
decent
beer
not
what
i
like
to
drink
everyday
but
my
choice
when
i
want
to
go
fishing
or
when
i
want
to
switch
it
up
with
a
cheap
beer
one
of
the
best
of
the
aals
an
american
classic
better
than
many
beers
that
cost
more
overall
i
am
not
going
to
dog
this
beer
though
it
is
not
anything
i
will
seek
out
again
it
is
a
perfect
american
adjunct
lager
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
but
it
is
as
solid
a
lawnmower
beer
as
has
ever
been
had
i
like
this
beer
a
whole
heck
of
a
lot
its
always
a
toss
up
for
me
to
get
either
a
bunch
of
coors
or
a
bunch
of
bud
i
get
excited
when
it
is
available
at
a
bar
on
the
east
coast
which
is
kinda
tough
even
though
coors
light
is
usually
available
everywhere
the
stubby
bottles
are
great
but
i
often
get
30
packs
of
the
cans
the
only
downfall
when
drinking
this
wonderful
beer
is
that
i
fart
more
than
beloved
budweiser
go
getcha
some
coors
ok
i
know
everyone
is
so
eager
to
sht
on
this
beer
but
what
im
rating
is
not
the
can

this

during
tour
of
the
brewery
at
golden
co
they
had
us
sample
some
of
the
beer
coming
straight
from
the
source
it
was
crisper
and
much
more
fresh
tasting
obviously
than
that
swill
you
buy
to
drown
your
consciousness
on
the
cheap
somewhere
between
the

and
your
local

the
brew
pours
out
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
to
me
this
is
how
brew
should
look
it
is
not
to
light
in
color
and
not
to
dark
the
smell
rich
with
flavor
also
smells
like
beer
the
taste
is
rich
and
smooth
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
coors
has
a
nice
clean
finish
this
brew
has
a
real
nice
balance
to
taste
and
smoothness
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
coors
is
a
good
drinking
brew
and
a
classy
brew
at
that
this
is
how
beer
should
be
not
overly
light
and
not
so
alcohol
taste
that
you
can
not
enjoy
the
brew
over
all
im
giving
coors
a
4
25
out
of
5
overall
i
didnt
judge
this
beer
too
harshly
because
it
is
intended
to
be
exactly
what
it
is
its
a
beer
meant
for
mass
consumption
not
necessarily
for
taste
that
being
said
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
for
a
hot
summery
day
after
doing
some
moving
or
lawn
work
or
just
working
hard
in
general
in
general
when
you
buy
this
type
of
beer
you
pretty
much
already
know
what
youve
gotten
yourself
into
a
beer
that
isnt
intimidating
and
complex
but
not
too
bad
either
overall
this
was
my
second
highest
rated
aal
below
pbr
this
one
is
still
a
pretty
bad
beer
however
and
has
redeeming
qualities
of
being
dirt
cheap
and
easy
to
drink
in
volume
o
as
far
as
innocuously
flavored
macro
lagers
go
this
isnt
horrible
accomplishes
what
its
intended
to
accomplish
of
the
three
bad

this
one
should
be
avoided

high
d
final
thoughts
the
banquet
beer
as
its
currently
being
advertised
here
offers
a
revelation
to
its
name
how
many
banquets
have
you
been
to
where
the
food
alright
or
good
but
certainly
wasnt
exceptional
myself
not
a
lot
as
the
cooks
generally
need
to
make
enough
food
quickly
for
everyone
see
the
parallel
on
this
one
so
coors
is
an
alright
beer
but
if
not
for
being
a
large
producer
whose
name
you
cannot
escape
it
is
a
rather
unremarkable
beer
its
certainly
not
an
unquaffable
brew
but
really
this
beer
exemplifies
a
just
plain
average
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
it
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
had
and
its
amazing
that
i
use
to
think
this
beer
was
hard
to
drink
because
now
for
as
much
as
i
have
learned
this
beer
is
crisp
and
really
light
relatively
speaking
not
a
bad
beer
o
im
pissed
that
i
payed
a
buck
a
can
for
this
buy
subpremium
brands
this
difference
between
this
and
pbr
is
minimal
pbr
sucks
but
so
does
this
beer
at
least
try
to
get
what
you
pay
for
coors
banquet
beer
which
is
also
known
as
coors
original
is
decent
big
brand
beer
that
competes
well
with
miller
and
budweiser
products
it
pours
real
pale
yellow
very
little
head
soapy
in
appearance
and
the
carbonation
dissipated
real
quick
surprisingly
there
was
no
metallic
taste
with
this
beer
it
is
watery
and
has
a
malty
corn
taste
it
is
not
filling
and
goes
good
with
food
nothing
sets
it
apart
from
other
big
brands
other
than
it
is
the
last
wholly
own
big
brand
company
because
miller
sabmiller
and
ab
inbev
are
both
foreign
controlled
note
back
in
1983
i
went
down
south
to
work
with
my
brother
in
virginia
at
the
age
of
19
i
worked
as
a
carpenter
each
day
i
would
get
dropped
off
at
a
job
site
and
i
work
in
90
heat
with
only
luke
warm
water
to
drink
from
a
garden
hose
every
night
i
was
picked
up
by
my
boss
and
he
have
a
ice
cold
6pack
of
coors
to
drink
beer
never
tasted
so
good
i
guess
any
beer
would
of
tasted
good
under
those
conditions
that
was
the
first
time
i
thought
beer
tasted
good
i
have
come
a
long
way
in
all
seriousness
though
its
not
one
of
the
worst
aals
ive
had
and
at
least
its
not
a
light
smells
of
sweet
corn
but
doesnt
have
too
much
of
an
adjunct
funk
to
it
its
pretty
smooth
and
doesnt
have
an
aftertaste
if
youve
had
molson
canadian
this
is
extremely
similar
to
it
although
this
one
is
a
little
nicer
im
not
going
to
comment
on
hop
and
malt
content
there
isnt
much
especially
to
a
newly
destroyed
palate
like
my
own
enough
rambling
if
you
like
aals
youll
like
this
one
try
it
this
is
a
great
beer
to
serve
freeloaders
that
come
to
your
house
to
drink
it
is
cheap
and
when
served
icecold
it
masks
the
straw
corn
sour
taste
of
the
malt
pours
a
big
bloated
foamy
sudzy
white
head
that
once
drank
develops
your
bowels
into
a
a
big
bloated
gas
pocket
causing
you
to
fart
the
rest
of
the
night
in
your
bed
and
then
fart
more
in
the
morning
coors
is
known
for
it
big
gas
yippy
in
the
summer
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
it
is
relatively
common
usually
fairly
cheap
and
comes
in
cans
good
for
camping
fishing
and
rafting
i
honestly
dont
think
coors
is
as
good
in
a
bottle
a
can
of
this
is
a
real
delight
when
the
beer
is
ice
cold
and
you
are
broiling
hot
just
what
this
type
of
beer
is
made
for
it
has
way
more
flavor
and
a
little
more
body
than
a
coors
light
which
for
some
reason
is
extremely
popular
around
here
it
goes
really
well
with
grilled
meat
o
so
this
is
a
simple
adjunct
lager
not
a
lot
of
flavor
or
aromas
but
it
is
crisp
and
clean
and
unoffensive
as
far
as
a
simple
cheap
brew
it
does
a
good
job
goes
well
with
burgers
chicken
wings
fried
squid
rolls
for
the
style
this
is
rather
good
and
in
my
opinion
does
not
get
enough
credit
for
an
american
adjunct
coors
has
so
much
more
flavor
than
any
other
macro
beer
the
bros
like
miller
high
life
and
pbr
better
than
coors
they
gave
budweiser
an
80
coors
is
a
great
everyday
beer
and
saddened
that
no
one
likes
it
mild
cooked
cabbage
all
in
all
coors
is
a
good
beer
can
poured
a
golden
color
lager
with
a
medium
bubbly
white
head
with
minimal
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
light
adjunct
notes
with
light
sweet
notes
taste
is
quite
bland
with
light
sweet
adjunct
notes
that
are
noticeable
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
nothing
shocking
here
and
probably
better
then
coors
light
but
still
incredibly
bland
at
the
end
of
the
day
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
adjunct
lagers
i
know
of
its
certainly
ok
nothing
is
really
off
with
this
beer
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
and
is
very
drinkable
in
quantity
with
5
percent
abv
its
a
good
backyard
bbq
beer
and
one
good
for
camping
other
other
outdoor
activities
coors
light
sucks
but
this
banquet
beer
is
ok
for
what
it
is
and
certainly
beats
miller
budwiser
etc
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
people
who
do
not
appreciate
craft
beer
when
you
are
doing
the
buying
banquet
has
an
excellent
mouthfeel
and
virtually
no
aftertaste
complimented
the
pizza
i
was
eating
very
well
love
love
love
this
beer
with
everyone
going
apeshit
over
this
one
being
released
in
alberta
i
thought
it
might
actually
be
worth
a
try
i
have
no
idea
why
the
masses
are
going
store
to
store
to
find
this
stuff
its
crap
overall
boring
but
not
offensive
though
on
the
thinner
side
theres
actually
a
little
bit
to
this
beer
the
body
is
light
but
not
terribly
watery
considering
it
doesnt
have
as
much
of
the
crispness
as
these
beers
seem
pride
themselves
on
but
a
little
more
of
the
smoothness
pours
a
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
1finger
foamy
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
too
long
some
light
spotty
lacing
was
seen
the
aroma
is
of
just
some
grain
and
corn
but
nothing
else
really
the
taste
is
a
little
watery
with
just
a
slight
sweet
aftertaste
high
carbonation
overall
a
decent
brew
for
during
the
warmer
months
pours
a
light
golden
color
lighter
than
most
adjunct
lagers
head
is
white
and
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
faint
banana
bread
and
grass
notes
predominate
slightly
malty
taste
with
hints
of
banana
the
powerful
carbonation
functions
like
a
palate
cleanser
clearing
most
tastes
mouthfeel
is
weak
with
some
malty
after
taste
overall
mediocre
but
better
than
some
aal
options
not
sure
why
i
picked
this
up
i
think
a
friend
of
mine
was
saying
how
good
it
was
for
what
it
is
its
drinkable
but
nothing
that
bas
will
be
even
close
to
impressed
with
aroma
is
maltsadjunct
sweetness
and
mild
tartness
the
flavor
is
sweetish
malts
light
fruit
and
a
tart
finish
one
of
the
few
macros
that
are
decent
smoother
than
most
nice
bubbles
thank
god
can
you
imagine
if
it
was
thick
with
that
shit
overall
not
really
the
best
brew
out
there
and
even
though
it
is
rather
cheap
there
are
much
better
beers
at
a
similar
price
that
one
could
substitute
for
this
od
a
decent
lager
respectable
stuff
nothing
crazy
but
what
youd
want
from
something
mass
produced
id
take
this
over
quite
a
few
poorly
done
craft
brews
pours
an
uberpale
straw
color
with
a
large
amount
of
white
foam
and
although
the
carbonation
starts
in
classic
overpowering
us
macrolager
fashion
i
find
that
it
dissipates
quickly
with
this
beer
and
reaches
a
more
manageable
level
aroma
is
sweet
for
an
adjunct
lager
with
a
lot
of
corn
and
some
subtle
hop
extract
that
veers
towards
the
fruity
palate
is
rounded
cornflake
sweetness
a
touch
of
green
weedy
hops
a
hint
of
butter
and
some
harsh
notes
that
recall
a
chemical
sweetener
like
aspartame
body
is
thin
and
sodalike
as
per
the
style
but
finish
is
less
astringent
than
rice
adjunct
beers
like
bud
my
ratings
might
be
a
tad
higher
than
deserved
but
coors
is
probably
the
best
in
a
bad
bunch
of
industrial
lagers
and
at
least
this
one
has
more
flavor
than
many
mainstream
euro
pale
lagers
or
american
adjunct
counterparts
i
try
to
keep
my
ratings
relative
coors
light
is
awful
devoid
of
flavor
and
meriting
no
consideration
coors
proper
isnt
a
musttry
but
you
might
be
surprised
by
how
drinkable
it
is
in
quantity
and
no
one
wants
to
empty
their
beer
fridge
of
superior
craft
offerings
during
a
binge
episode
mouthfeel
very
light
very
smooth
carbonation
was
lower
than
i
expected
its
better
than
coors
light
ill
give
it
that
pours
a
paler
than
piss
yellow
with
a
head
that
starts
off
two
fingers
and
within
two
minutes
turns
to
soap
suds
smells
grainy
with
a
hint
of
bread
tastes
a
little
bit
like
sourdough
which
is
quite
surprising
not
that
it
tastes
like
sourdough
but
that
it
has
any
taste
at
all
mouthfeel
is
thin
water
and
overcarbonated
if
it
were
cheap
at
a
bar
id
drink
it
over
the
standard
fair
but
if
im
at
a
bar
chances
are
im
drinking
double
ryes
final
grade
3

a
high
c
coors
banquet
beer
is
easily
one
of
the
better
macro
adjunct
lagers
available
on
the
market
right
now
while
i
have
little
doubt
that
the
usual
ba
set
will
poohpooh
this
brew
as
a
matter
of
habit
the
fact
remains
that
it
is
still
a
highly
quaffable
moderately
tasty
pale
lager
that
i
would
never
turn
down
as
opposed
to
coors
light
which
you
would
need
to
pay
me
to
consume
id
take
this
over
most
of
the
comparable
lagers
available
in
this
province
certainly
long
before
id
consider
picking
up
a
budweiser
labatt
blue
or
most
other
premium
snort
brands
this
gets
the
same
score
i
gave
to
molson
canadian
much
better
than
coors
light
coors
is
actually
a
really
good
beer
yes
i
did
just
say
that
but
when
you
are
looking
to
go
out
on
the
lake
and
have
a
great
time
coors
should
always
beat
out
bud
and
mgd
the
beer
is
a
light
color
the
aroma
is
crisp
and
clean
pours
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
does
not
have
a
battery
acid
taste
that
its
peers
do
a
good
beer
when
you
are
low
on
cash
and
options
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
when
consumed
ice
cold
just
drink
it
quick
and
youll
enjoy
its
refreshing
potential
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
perhaps
the
least
bad
of
the
big
macro
lagers
ive
always
thought
coors
was
a
little
cut
above
the
rest
the
flavor
is
decent
with
some
gentle
corn
pop
flavor
but
in
general
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
the
only
real
gripe
is
the
minimal
amount
of
malt
flavor
but
it
is
not
that
offensive
and
is
pretty
crisp
flavorwise
overall
i
dont
find
this
to
that
bad
of
an
example
of
the
style
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
perhaps
if
you
are
having
a
bowl
of
spicy
chili
or
some
extremely
hot
wings
it
would
not
be
a
bad
choice
since
it
is
pretty
mild
and
refreshes
the
palate
with
moderate
but
not
overdone
effervescent
quality
o
i
actually
prefer
this
to
many
other
aals
its
pretty
inoffensive
and
lacks
a
lot
of
those
nasty
cooked
veggie
flavors
has
its
flaws
but
when
ice
cold
its
very
refreshing
the
classic
banquet
beer
may
not
be
an
earth
shattering
macro
but
it
is
crisp
refreshing
and
would
be
perfect
for
summer
cookouts
this
is
definitely
a
step
or
two
better
than
your
average
american
adjunct
lager
i
can
taste
the
malt
in
this
can
it
tastes
good
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
on
the
big
red
bus
irish
pub
crawl
well
it
was
free
but
there
was
a
decent
maltiness
which
i
really
enjoyed
for
a
session
beer
i
need
to
try
it
again
but
this
was
surprising
to
me
pardon
my
higherthanexpected
scores
o
this
is
the
best
coors
has
to
offer
it
is
strangely
rare
in
my
area
it
has
more
flavor
than
their
other
beers
unfortunately
coors
beers
are
tasteless
it
is
decent
for
a
macro
lager
o
not
great
but
ive
definitely
had
worse
o
i
found
this
to
be
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
because
it
doesnt
have
a
lightbodied
or
watery
mouthfeel
and
has
enough
in
the
way
of
bitterness
to
balance
off
the
malts
not
too
proud
to
admit
i
like
this
beer
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
better
macro
aals
out
there
despite
its
flaws
its
very
inoffensive
and
highly
drinkable
overall
my
favorite
of
the
three
main
bmc
offerings
only
good
for
hot
summer
days
while
mowing
or
maybe
while
camping
maybe
another
mega
brewing
lager
that
taste
just
like
the
last
actually
you
let
this
one
sit
in
the
can
long
enough
it
will
start
to
taste
like
metal
which
might
be
an
upgrade
the
color
is
a
nice
clear
light
yellow
smell
flavor
and
mouth
feel
are
all
disgusting
however
if
your
at
a
tail
gate
i
would
rather
drink
beerwater
then
a
stout
i
just
hope
these
mega
brewers
create
a
good
beer
wishful
thinking
a
little
too
much
dms
even
with
the
acceptance
in
the
category
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
finish
as
well
still
rather
pleasant
and
very
clean
in
style
atmosphere
is
okay
solid
head
no
real
lacing
nose
is
very
light
grain
hop
combo
light
flavor
components
consisting
of
hay
malt
hops
and
something
sweet
in
the
background
overall
this
is
serviceable
at
best
this
is
that
standard
that
i
drank
in
highchool
in
my
adolescent
years
overall
grreat
appearance
bitter
tasting
more
bitterness
some
water
notes
with
more
bitterness
great
appearance
golden
brown
has
an
amasing
head
as
it
fizzes
out
of
the
aluminium
containment
vessel
great
mouthfeel
drink
it
now
coors
25
coors
banquet
is
the
by
far
best
of
the
big
three
it
has
a
full
well
rounded
flavor
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
i
do
enjoy
craft
beers
but
this
is
not
a
craft
beer
but
i
like
it
why
it
is
available
any
where
were
i
live
no
offensive
flavors
or
aftertaste
and
price
it
solid
american
adjunct
lager
beer
with
very
high
drinkability
poured
this
24
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
this
american
adjunct
lager
poured
a
slight
hazy
golden
color
produced
an
average
wight
head
poor
retention
and
it
left
only
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
faint
notes
of
grain
and
just
a
touch
of
floral
hops
light
in
body
this
brew
has
a
foundation
of
adjunct
ingredients
corn
minerals
and
lemon
citrus
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
clean
overall
for
the
style
its
not
worst
adjunct
lager
out
there
needs
to
be
served
ice
cold
once
it
hits
room
temp
throw
it
out
easy
drinking
light
beer
that
you
can
bbq
with
sit
back
have
a
couple
dozen
on
a
hot
summers
day
the
type
of
beer
if
you
are
doing
a
lot
of
shots
with
friends
you
can
do
chasers
with
all
night
long
its
better
than
a
bud
or
most
other
commercial
domestics
o
my
dad
has
told
me
stories
about
people
making
long
trips
to
colorado
to
buy
this
stuff
when
it
wasnt
available
everywhere
back
in
the
day
im
not
sure
about
it
being
that
good
but
im
pleasantly
surprised
after
having
coors
light
occasionally
for
years
and
never
bothering
to
try
the
original
im
impressed
actually
as
far
as
american
adjunctsmacros
go
this
one
is
pretty
solid
ill
get
it
again
sometime
poured
this
24
oz
can
into
a

glass
this
american
adjunct

and

mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
clean
overall
for
the
style
its
not
worst
adjunct
lager
out
there
o
overall
this
is
a
great
smooth
aal
very
refreshing
and
tastes
quite
good
i
will
be
buying
more
of
coors
i
just
became
a
fan
of
this
beer
for
taste
i
had
a
lovehate
relationship
at
first
to
me
it
had
an
odd
aftertaste
to
it
which
was
unique
nowadays
though
coors
has
a
very
refreshing
taste
to
me
not
much
sounds
better
to
me
than
popping
a
cold
coors
after
a
long
day
of
work
in
the
mouth
it
its
very
balanced
and
refreshing
overall
coors
banquet
beer
is
in
my
top
10
and
will
probably
always
be
my
goto
beer
for
years
to
come
this
inexpensive
american
classic
cant
be
stopped
though
its
available
in
a
bottle
and
on
taprarely
found
in
my
part
on
the
woods
you
just
cant
beat
it
in
a
can
when
served
in
an
icecold
can
coors
is
truly
an
enjoyable
brew
just
pop
the
top
punch
a
hole
in
the
top
and
let
it
flow
for
a
day
on
the
beach
forget
the
silver
bullet
and
reach
for
the
original
here
i
have
a
coors
original
not
too
bad
opened
a
bottle
from
a
6pack
purchased
cold
and
consumed
very
cold
the
best
out
of
the
adjuncts
in
my
opinion
this
beer
has
been
enjoyed
a
many
night
in
the
rocky
mountains
of
central
colorado
ive
toured
the
famed
coors
brewery
in
golden
witnessed
the
river
flowing
into
their
operation
indeed
flowing
out
of
the
mountains
driven
by
many
of
cold
mornings
seeing
the
brewery
in
full
swing
with
mass
production
my
point
is
this
beer
is
the
flagship
of
adolf
coors
and
his
legacy
im
sure
its
been
watered
down
and
modified
for
mass
production
and
distribution
since
its
original
inception
years
ago
so
we
have
the
modern
day
banquet
beer
as
it
were
it
is
what
it
is
coors
present
tense
still
my
favorite
sessionable
adjunct
american
lager
pound
them
down
cold
not
for
everyone
arguably
the
best
of
the
macros
i
kept
this
on
my
porch
during
a
blizzard
its
coors
its
meant
to
be
enjoyed
cold
and
sucked
down
rather
quickly
no
hops
presences
almost
a
syrupy
flavor
but
one
thats
actually
pleasing
whether
or
not
you
like
it
you
have
to
agree
that
it
tastes
like
something
which
is
sadly
more
than
you
can
say
about
its
competition
one
of
those
classic
cookout
beers
you
can
drink
a
ton
without
feeling
sick
coors
has
tried
to
step
up
their
game
as
of
late
with
third
shift
and
batch
19
and
in
hindsight
coors
banquet
aint
so
bad
just
dont
expect
a
new
usual
this
fails
to
meet
my
superlow
expectations
i
prefer
even
coors
light
to
coors
you
can
tell
by
the
effort
i
put
into
this
beer
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
o
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
more
flavorful
than
the
other
bmc
beers
and
probably
less
offensive
i
would
not
cringe
at
having
to
drink
this
one
at
the
ballparkstadium
or
a
concert
but
i
definitely
will
not
be
purchasing
this
one
for
home
consumption
the
flavor
severely
worsens
as
this
one
warms
up
needs
to
be
drank
very
cold
screw
all
the
bad
reviews
by
the
beer
snobs
coors
banquet
is
my
favorite
beer
by
far
i
cant
find
anything
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
at
all
the
smoothest
most
crisp
and
most
enjoyable
beer
in
the
world
plain
and
simple
glad
to
live
on
the
u
s
border
so
this
fine
beer
is
available
to
me
at
all
times
lots
of
bad
american
beers
coors
banquet
is
an
exception
this
is
one
of
the
most
underrated
beers
i
have
had
it
is
one
of
the
old
standbys
especially
if
you
are
going
to
drink
a
few
of
them
the
color
is
golden
typical
of
an
aal
the
smell
is
sweet
kind
of
grainy
but
not
overly
sweet
it
has
a
crispness
to
the
smell
clean
the
taste
is
smooth
and
has
a
clean
carbonated
mouthfeel
this
is
not
thing
really
surprising
to
the
style
but
as
this
is
one
of
the
first
good
mass
produced
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
has
a
special
place
in
my
memories
although
i
like
to
try
a
variety
of
beers
nowadays
this
one
is
one
i
will
go
back
to
on
a
hot
summer
night
you
know
during
the
beer
drinking
weather
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
out
there
for
the
price
and
pretty
remarkable
for
such
a
large
conglomerate
to
be
able
to
produce
such
a
quality
beer
so
consistently
smell
taste
and
appearance
sum
up
to
be
a
beautiful
thing
looks
wonderful
love
the
labeling
wish
more
places
around
here
florida
would
have
it
on
tap
what
can
be
said
honestly
to
me
pretty
much
all
adjunct
lagers
taste
the
same
they
have
that
cornymalty
taste
and
a
cornysweet
aftertaste
coors
isnt
an
awful
beer
but
cmon
its
not
a
beer
you
drink
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
for
cheap
and
get
drunk
on
plain
and
simple
i
can
say
that
its
slightly
better
than
budweiser
as
it
doesnt
have
an
extremely
corny
and
skunklike
taste
but
its
still
nothing
to
be
proud
to
drink
overall
i
can
drink
this
all
day
but
not
because
its
good
its
so
damn
watery
and
flavorless
that
its
literally
like
drinking
water
with
a
hint
of
sweetner
in
that
sense
i
like
it
better
than
budweiser
but
as
a
beer
its
virtually
nonexistent
for
that
reason
its
fairly
tricky
to
score
because
i
probably
like
it
slightly
better
than
my
score
presents
i
also
love
water
if
this
were
waterybeeradvocate
com
this
beer
would
get
a
near
perfect
score
but
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
its
below
average
at
best
odor
is
grain
taste
is
sort
of
bland
and
general
nothing
really
stands
out
not
terrible
for
a
hot
day
and
little
money
better
than
other
mass
marketsmiller
bud
amstel
light
it
is
what
it
is
really
as
good
in
cans
as
in
bottles
but
not
really
that
good
overall
just
had
2
officially
review
standard
coors
when
i
found
one
in
my
brother
in
laws
frig
macro
rice
beer
as
expected
standard
bud
is
much
better
in
general
coors
light
is
nice
on
a
hot
day
instead
of
water
but
i
digress
this
would
not
be
my
choice
for
that
deserted
island
scenario
not
bad
for
its
style
i
think
i
would
seek
this
out
on
draught
but
batch
19
is
superior
this
is
no
cowboy
classic
this
is
crap
watered
down
yellow
pee
looking
adjunct
brew
that
only
leaves
you
with
a
few
extra
bucks
in
your
pocket
and
a
hangover
for
the
ages
this
is
for
the
birds
weak
extracty
malt
nose
metallic
taste
minneraly
and
off
in
the
finish
a
little
sweet
and
oddly
grainy
in
feel
its
got
too
much
carbonation
not
enough
body
and
is
highly
lacking
in
the
tradition
and
western
values
it
seems
to
have
built
its
reputation
on
is
it
better
than
a
coors
light
maybe
in
certain
circumstances
but
in
isolation
this
is
a
terrible
beer
and
i
would
much
prefer
to
not
drink
than
to
drink
this
9
times
out
of
10
slightly
better
looking
and
tasting
than
some
adjunct
lagers
yet
theres
nothing
else
really
going
for
this
beer
it
would
be
easy
to
confuse
this
adjunct
lager
with
any
other
beer
of
the
same
style
in
a
blindtaste
test
and
thats
exactly
why
in
my
opinion
many
beers
of
this
style
garner
such
relatively
low
ratings
theres
very
little
if
anything
to
set
this
beer
apart
from
its
peers
i
used
to
like
this
before
i
got
into
craft
beer
but
now
i
dont
know
what
i
saw
in
this
pours
a
clear
slightly
pale
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
scent
is
weak
with
cheap
grassy
grains
and
corn
there
taste
is
rather
decent
for
a
cheap
domestic
beer
with
thorough
bold
grainy
flavors
sorry
but
like
most
cheap
beer
i
can
never
seem
to
find
the
hops
and
only
a
slight
bit
of
malts
it
has
a
decent
flavor
and
an
ok
volume
one
of
the
better
tasting
cheap
beers
along
with
pabst
to
say
the
least
i
would
drink
this
any
day
over
coors
light
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
a
distinct
popcorn
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
sweet
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
that
is
only
drinkable
when
its
super
cold
note
i
review
for
the
style
i
refuse
to
let
my
prejudices
slant
any
review
nothing
worse
than
the
typical
beer
snob
reviewing
an
aal
same
for
your
aal
drinker
reviewing
a
craft
brew
light
body
higher
carbonation
crisp
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
this
was
a
nice
reminder
of
why
i
dont
buy
or
drink
beers
like
this
o
i
dont
think
ive
ever
drank
real
coors
before
and
i
may
never
again
a
good
clean
not
over
carbonated
lager
they
dont
use
sugar
and
carbonation
to
cover
up
low
end
brewing
techniques
like
the
biggest
american
brewery
does
coors
banquet
has
a
real
lager
beer
taste
very
clean
and
balanced
as
far
as
macro
brews
go
i
prefer
coors
banquet
and
schiltz
60s
formula
they
taste
like
american
beer
should
i
dont
know
why
coors
banquet
has
such
a
low
rating
i
love
this
stuff
its
so
easy
drinking
tastes
good
perfect
beer
for
a
bbq
or
hanging
out
coors
has
been
a
fixture
for
my
nfl
sundays
for
years
go
seahawks
and
go
coors
good
stuff
o
overall
a
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
adjunct
would
i
have
it
again
yes
along
with
that
coors
has
a
great
american
history
from
beginning
as
the
dream
of
young
prussian
immigrant
adolph
coors
to
establishing
the
american
heritage
foundation
by
joseph
coors
o
for
the
cheaper
beers
i
would
say
this
would
have
the
advantage
over
the
millers
and
the
buds
i
didnt
taste
any
of
that
metallic
feel
in
it
i
would
have
this
again
preferably
with
food
just
a
typical
average
nonoffensive
aal
that
cant
compete
with
non
bmc
stuff
good
for
what
it
is
d
for
an
aal
this
isnt
half
bad
the
profile
seemed
to
provide
something
interesting
that
most
other
dont
and
id
rather
this
over
bud
but
even
then
i
dont
see
myself
revisiting
this
ever
again
especially
due
to
its
availability
this
was
the
bottle
of
the
month
at
a
local
bar
near
my
house
i
bought
so
many
that
i
lost
count
it
really
grew
on
me
i
like
it
better
than
coors
light
for
sure
it
actually
has
a
pretty
distinct
taste
that
i
like
and
the
price
for
a
case
isnt
terrible
either
being
pretty
new
to
the
beer
scene
i
was
unaware
of
this
beer
because
ive
always
been
so
inundated
with
commercials
for
the
light
but
this
is
certainly
a
superior
brew
give
it
a
try
not
the
worst
aal
but
still
nothing
truly
enjoyable
about
it
overall
better
to
me
than
the
other
adjuncts
but
not
by
much
if
im
drinking
to
get
drunk
a
bud
or
miller
or
coors
all
to
the
same
for
me
o
not
a
bad
as
people
make
it
out
to
be
way
ahead
of
the
bmc
light
beers
goes
best
ice
cold
with
outdoor
activities
its
a
very
basic
brew
and
thats
ok
i
would
recommend
it
as
one
of
the
best
starter
beers
for
any
new
beer
drinker
cheers
footnote
there
have
been
some
posters
that
have
wondered
how
coors
came
up
with
the
name
banquet
beer
heres
how
it
happened
in
1936
coors
adds
banquet
beer
to
its
name
as
legends
go
area
miners
would
throw
parties
during
the
1800s
called
banquetsstocked
with
requisite
coors
the
banquet
beer
became
a
part
of
the
coors
name
as
homage
to
lively
gatherings
and
a
western
legacy
original
review
on
07092010
overall
3
55
and
glad
i
got
to
try
it
it
is
good
the
beer
tastes
bready
and
slightly
sweet
from
the
corn
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
its
a
mild
flavor
its
a
clean
tasting
lager
the
body
is
light
with
adequate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
and
this
is
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
its
a
refreshing
lager
that
has
its
place
on
a
hot
summer
day
tailgates
or
as
a
cheaper
beer
option
while
watching
a
game
overall
meh
its
nothing
more
than
an
average
aal
low
taste
easy
to
drink
very
similar
to
the
other
big
names
miller
and
budweiser
albeit
a
bit
more
sweet
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
that
goes
down
rather
quickly
not
much
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
adjunct
corn
and
possibly
some
pungent
hops
taste
is
watered
down
with
some
corn
sweetness
followed
by
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
flavoring
became
worse
drinkability
is
ok
if
served
cold
a
bready
brew
i
prefer
this
over
budweiser
because
it
has
more
flavor
in
both
the
malt
and
hop
categories
the
positive
is
thats
its
fairly
smooth
the
negative
is
the
aftertaste
which
is
a
little
foul
coors
light
fans
will
be
in
for
a
surprise
as
this
is
much
much
more
flavorful
i
prefer
coors
banquet
in
a
bottle
coors
banquet
is
one
of
my
favorite
adjunct
lagers
the
appearance
is
golden
colored
with
soapy
fizzy
headafter
the
initial
pour
the
head
disappears
but
find
it
much
less
carbonated
than
other
macros
smell
is
slight
lemonbanana
and
sweet
grains
taste
is
sweet
grains
and
very
mild
hops
to
me
the
adjunct
taste
is
rice
not
corn
dominant
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
refreshing
you
can
drink
these
all
day
long
m
light
bodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
really
nice
and
smooth
a
typical
adjunct
lager
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
sizable
white
foamy
head
and
goes
away
rather
quickly
no
lacing
on
the
glass
initial
smell
is
of
corn
and
minimal
hops
tastes
is
really
the
same
with
a
bitter
finish
at
the
end
that
is
not
very
pleasant
very
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
if
you
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
o
easy
drinking
ale
mild
flavoured
though
a
typical
mass
produced
ale
not
worthy
of
drinking
unless
theres
no
other
options
available
its
okay
id
rather
have
coors
light
for
whatever
reason
it
has
less
taste
but
better
flavor
in
my
opinion
out
of
the
adjuncts
id
place
this
just
below
pbr
if
its
all
there
is
ill
certainly
drink
it
cheers
o
boring
but
at
the
time
hit
the
spot
but
i
think
any
beer
would
have
worked
the
group
i
got
it
from
also
had
some
new
belgium
and
six
point
and
when
they
offered
me
a
beer
i
was
excited
only
to
get
an
og
the
best
of
bmc
by
a
narrow
margin
has
all
the
adjunct
lager
hallmarks
sweet
corn
weak
malt
watery
little
hoppage
weak
sweet
and
watery
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
given
other
choices
feels
thin
and
leaves
the
palate
moist
overall
this
beer
isnt
as
bad
as
most
of
the
other
adjuncts
out
there
id
take
this
all
day
over
mgd
coors
light
bud
light
etc
if
i
had
to
drink
a
beer
in
this
style
i
would
probably
choose
coors
its
not
because
its
overly
flavorful
or
unique
but
because
it
avoids
all
of
the
off
flavors
associated
with
the
style
its
not
metallic
nor
does
it
have
an
applelike
off
flavor
from
the
yeast
the
body
is
creamy
and
medium
the
taste
is
alive
with
malts
and
crisp
hop
ending
enough
of
the
coors
criticism
this
beer
was
actually
halfway
decent
but
with
a
2010
date
maybe
the
storage
did
it
some
good
this
beer
is
really
not
too
bad
average
looks
and
smell
for
a
big
commercial
brewery
product
the
flavor
is
s
step
above
ok
bready
sweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
more
malty
than
hoppy
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
goes
down
very
clean
with
a
bit
of
sparkle
from
some
powerful
carbonation
no
reason
to
say
this
beer
is
not
good
for
its
pedigree
this
leans
towards
the
top
of
macro
brews
for
sure
overall
good
go
to
beer
for
gettin
drunk
a
decent
choice
for
horse
shoes
and
darts
d
nough
said
overall
this
is
much
better
than
the
light
version
nothing
exceptional
nice
change
from
budweiser
overall
ho
hum
boring
adjunct
taste
very
light
bodied
but
clean
and
smooth
slight
and
i
mean
a
slight
hop
taste
not
much
taste
or
flavor
typical
lager
like
bud
and
miller
overall
tolerable
adjunct
lager
i
like
the
outdoorsy
associations
more
than
the
beer
the
beer
poured
a
clear
light
golden
color
and
produced
a
fizzy
white
head
that
was
not
retained
at
all
noticeable
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
beer
gave
off
a
light
grainy
aroma
not
bad
but
not
all
that
good
either
the
taste
followed
the
aroma
but
i
honestly
thought
it
was
a
little
better
than
expected
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
and
it
borders
on
overcarbonation
but
i
do
have
to
say
that
the
beer
was
smooth
overall
a
less
than
average
beer
but
a
lot
better
than
most
in
the
style
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
short
lived
finger
of
white
head
no
lace
and
a
spot
of
retention
nose
has
some
light
corn
and
general
malty
grain
sweetness
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
sweet
and
almost
faintly
fruity
malt
a
hint
of
some
red
delicious
apple
flesh
high
carbonation
that
bites
very
light
in
weight
quite
watery
although
simple
this
is
wholly
unoffensive
i
thought
a
straight
up
aal
and
something
i
might
chance
to
option
for
in
light
of
lesser
offerings
in
the
style
overall
score
bumped
up
as
function
of
superiority
within
the
style
o
just
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
desire
to
drink
i
truly
tried
to
keep
style
in
mind
but
to
be
frank
i
would
prefer
a
budweiser
to
this
hell
id
take
a
corona
extra
over
this
if
i
could
stick
a
lime
in
it
i
still
believe
that
the
japanese
rice
lagers
are
the
best
mass
produced
adjunct
lager
strictly
in
the
american
adjunct
style
id
take
most
caribbean
lagers
over
most
of
their
american
counterparts
this
is
the
adjunct
lager
i
dont
mind
drinking
as
much
as
the
others
still
has
the
cooked
vegetables
taste
that
coors
light
has
but
with
more
body
and
more
excusable
grains
to
tolerate
it
its
not
as
bad
still
this
is
in
the
only
drink
because
its
the
lesser
evil
category
overall
never
ever
buy
this
beer
just
wrong
served
up
in
the
classic
yellow
can
aromas
of
bread
and
grain
with
some
dry
fruit
notes
tastes
of
sweet
fruit
with
mild
citrus
and
bread
very
different
flavor
from
the
other
two
major
brewers
its
a
lot
sweeter
but
a
bit
more
pleasant
to
drink
goes
down
really
smooth
on
those
occasions
that
my
choices
are
this
miller
or
budill
go
with
this
not
much
aroma
just
grassy
grainy
hints
looks
to
be
the
typical
adjunct
lager
but
it
isnt
skunky
so
that
is
a
big
plus
for
me
not
as
watery
as
a
light
lager
still
bland
and
lacking
in
hops
but
fits
the
style
coors
is
a
decent
lager
nothing
special
though
definitely
finish
this
one
while
it
is
still
cold
i
was
very
very
surprised
with
this
one
considering
how
much
i
hate
coors
light
i
would
give
it
another
try
o
the
drinkability
here
isnt
so
good
sure
it
goes
down
like
water
but
the
flavor
is
really
lacking
there
isnt
really
anything
going
on
but
a
grainy
sweetness
and
a
cornlike
flavor
the
aftertaste
also
has
some
off
flavors
overall
it
isnt
really
an
offensive
beer
but
it
really
isnt
very
good
i
do
find
it
better
than
any
of
abs
busch

the

hereso
not
very
fair
to
compare
i
will
continue
to
patron
this
company
o
just
your
average
light
malty
brew
on
that
scale
i
wish
i
were
drinking
a
labatte
o
one
for
the
ages
this
beer
will
always
remind
me
of
certain
things
in
life
its
not
the
best
for
the
style
but
its
still
pretty
damn
refreshing
when
ice
cold
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
for
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorites
when
i
want
to
have
more
than
a
few
overall
this
beers
ok
id
still
rather
drink
a
bud
poured
from
a
24oz
can
into
a
beer
glass
the
head
was
a
bright
white
and
foamy
the
beer
with
a
pale
golden
color
the
taste
of
this
canned
beer
has
a
kind
of
faint
solvent
like
taste
with
high
carbonation
i
dont
remember
the
bottled
beer
version
tasting
like
this
but
i
will
retry
that
to
confirm
this
can
beer
is
not
that
great
to
wash
down
food
or
drink
upon
cutting
the
lawn
on
a
hot
day
the
appearance
is
your
avearage
like
yellow
color
with
a
thick
head
the
smell
is
of
straw
and
maybe
corn
the
taste
is
pretty
like
how
it
tasted
with
corn
and
some
malt
the
mouthfeel
to
me
was
much
better
than
the
other
crappy
beers
and
wasnt
too
terrible
the
beer
overall
isnt
horrible
but
i
would
never
spend
money
on
it
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
sweet
and
fairly
drinkable
my
palate
has
come
a
long
way
since
the
mid
80s
but
coors
had
held
up
surprisingly
well
overall
i
find
that
the
coors
and
coors
light
beers
both
a
have
a
distinctive
taste
that
sets
it
apart
from
its
competitors
i
guess
that
the
macrodrinkers
either
love
it
or
hate
it
not
something
id
buy
again
but
after
having
countless
coors
lights
while
growing
up
its
nice
to
see
what
the
nonlight
version
tastes
like
a
run
of
the
mill
brew
fit
only
for
drinking
after
a
few
quality
brews
unimpressive
color
smell
and
taste
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
seltzer
with
a
hint
of
yeast
it
does
have
a
very
light
tingly
palate
making
it
good
fair
for
big
picnics
bbqs
or
a
day
at
the
beech
that
being
said
for
massproduced
cheap
beer
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
poured
a
3
velvety
white
head
light
clear
straw
yellow
color
and
very
few
body
bubbles
so
it
appears
all
the
carbonation
went
to
that
early
head
pour
smells
mildly
of
grain
taste
is
like
mildly
sweetened
water
in
fact
thats
what
this
is
water
dressed
up
to
look
and
smell
like
any
bmc
beer
plus
that
2
stage
cold
activation
bottle
label
is
a
joke
who
needs
help
telling
if
their
bottle
is
cold
why
not
just
feel
it
oh
wait
youre
supposed
to
drink
this
so
ice
cold
you
cant
really
taste
anything
ohhh
then
make
a
better
beer
instead
of
a
better
label
o
another
terrible
beer
from
a
macro
a
fair
lot
better
than
its
little
brother
the
only
coors
brand
currently
available
this
side
of
the
49th
parallel
but
thats
only
saying
so
much
still
plain
and
stiff
but
i
give
it
props
for
the
general
lack
of
skunk
and
even
though
ive
finally
sampled
this
i
suppose
ill
never
know
if
joe
the
cop
was
right
in
his
assertion
regarding
the
relative
quality
of
pawtucket
patriot
ale
another
standard
american
adjuct
beer
the
color
is
yellow
and
clear
with
good
carbonation
that
results
in
a
white
foam
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
and
taste
are
primarily
grain
with
attempted
balnace
of
hops
etc
the
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
light
drinkability
a
real
disappointment
i
have
not
had
an
original
coors
in
forever
and
expected
much
more
it
is
not
offensive
almost
but
not
quite
but
i
suppose
it
would
do
well
after
working
all
day
in
the
heat
frankly
though
i
think
i
would
rather
sip
sarsaparilla
with
sam
elliott
overall
drinkability
not
really
even
decent
for
an
aal
pours
a
typical
fizzy
pale
in
color
without
much
head
tastes
of
grains
sweet
malt
and
actually
a
fair
amount
of
hops
which
give
it
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
go
with
the
sweet
malts
finishes
crisp
dry
and
bitter
fairly
carbonated
but
very
smooth
i
think
the
water
is
what
really
makes
this
beer
stand
out
for
me
it
just
tastes
very
pure
o
ive
had
worse
pour
yields
a
nice
1
finger
head
at
first
i
thought
the
color
was
a
deep
amber
til
i
realized
it
was
just
so
transparent
i
could
see
my
desk
top
through
but
still
it
has
a
bright
and
bubbly
golden
yellow
not
to
thin
smell
is
kind
of
sharp
and
sour
grassy
and
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
shine
through
in
the
nose
the
cereal
and
corniness
is
dumbed
down
and
has
quite
a
nice
smell
to
it
taste
is
initially
somewhat
bitter
but
disappears
fast
nice
grassy
and
tart
hops
on
the
tongue
compared
to
something
like
summerfest
it
fails
obviously
although
it
they
just
amped
up
the
flavor
just
a
bit
then
it
would
come
close
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
could
use
some
work
not
as
overcarbonated
as
most
american
adjuncts
good
summertime
brew
oh
right
mouthfeel
starchy
water
overall
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
its
decent
but
otherwise
unimpressive
needs
some
oomph
that
its
sorely
lacking
to
make
it
anything
id
buy
on
its
own
merit
the
rest
body
is
pretty
thin
its
not
the
worst
of
the
macro
lagers
but
its
definitely
not
the
best
othis
is
a
beer
you
drink
to
get
drunk
because
of
its
price
and
quantity
you
get
for
it
would
drink
this
at
a
party
as
a
last
resort
but
would
never
stock
my
fridge
with
this
beer
a
lot
better
than
bud
and
miller
also
most
adjunct
lager
i
had
average
average
average
is
all
i
can
say
i
think
coors
or
whatever
foreign
company
owns
them
these
days
has
put
all
their
chips
on
coors
light
a
truly
terrible
beer
if
you
can
even
call
it
a
beer
while
regular
banquet
coors
could
do
with
a
little
marketing
muscle
better
than
bud
or
mgd
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
good
when
youve
got
a
lot
on
your
mind
and
want
an
easy
quaff
but
fwiw
it
does
a
good
job
at
what
i
think
the
intention
was
well
as
far
as
one
of
the
big
3
in
the
us
coors
is
far
and
away
the
the
best
choice
between
bud
bud
light
miller
high
life
or
miller
lite
this
straw
colored
brew
is
quite
good
i
am
not
beer
snob
i
will
drink
what
i
like
when
i
like
unlike
some
of
the
people
i
drink
with
i
know
i
take
some
shit
from
them
from
time
to
time
for
my
picks
in
beer
give
coors
a
shot
butyou
beer
experts
beer
snobs
know
it
all
or
you
think
you
do
just
maybe
its
a
status
thing
with
your
craft
brews
thanks
see
you
steveo
verdict
while
coors
banquet
suffers
from
the
same
problems
as
the
other
beers
in
the
style
its
balanced
better
than
much
of
its
competition
balance
alone
however
is
not
enough
to
win
the
day
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
poured
a
12oz
can
into
pint
glass
very
light
to
medium
light
straw
color
faint
smell
of
sweet
corn
and
slight
alcohol
sweeter
than
most
mass
produced
not
bad
but
not
good
either
average
beer
can
go
down
very
quickly
could
do
worse
much
much
better
than
its
light
counterpart
i
will
drink
if
available
but
not
going
to
make
a
special
trip
overall
this
beer
is
not
too
shabby
d
this
was
one
of
those
24ozers
you
can
pick
up
at
711
for
pocket
change
and
you
could
do
worse
for
sure
if
all
youre
looking
for
is
a
buzz
and
the
general
taste
of
beer
look
no
further
o
very
surprised
just
because
coors
light
sucks
so
hard
its
a
cheap
beer
i
feel
no
embarassment
purchasing
o
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
its
an
average
beer
and
its
not
any
better
than
that
once
again
with
a
coors
the
head
looks
very
nice
but
i
can
literally
hear
it
fizzing
away
the
body
is
completely
clear
and
yellow
it
doesnt
look
any
better
than
the
coors
light
even
though
it
gets
a
way
better
grade
for
some
reason
the
head
is
completely
gone
now
on
the
smell
i
pretty
much
get
the
same
thing
i
do
with
the
coors
light
adjuncts
small
amounts
of
malt
no
real
hops
to
speak
of
it
smells
sour
as
well
just
like
the
coors
light
did
the
smell
is
pretty
bad
one
thing
i
do
notice
is
that
the
flavor
is
a
tiny
bit
bigger
and
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
tiny
bit
bigger
than
the
coors
light
but
for
the
most
part
its
the
same
exact
taste
and
feel
not
comparing
it
to
the
coors
light
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
probably
the
most
surprising
part
its
not
that
bad
and
the
taste
is
bad
but
like
i
said
not
bad
as
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
though
is
actually
acceptable
drinkability
is
a
little
better
too
but
its
not
that
great
either
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
a
little
more
bearable
overall
obviously
a
bad
beer
nothing
too
different
from
the
coors
light
but
it
is
better
in
some
small
ways
overall
just
a
adjunct
lager
nose
is
of
light
grassy
hops
body
is
light
and
crisp
there
are
definitely
some
flavors
in
this
brew
some
light
earthiness
from
hops
and
sweetness
from
grain
there
is
not
much
of
a
finish
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
best
american
macro
i
finished
a
whole
bottle
coors
original
in
most
ways
is
a
pretty
standard
looking
and
tasting
beer
the
pour
is
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
vanishes
quickly
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
a
fresh
sweet
smell
of
grains
the
taste
backs
up
the
smell
with
a
little
bit
of
a
honey
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
much
better
than
their
light
version
i
wouldnt
mind
consuming
this
one
at
a
party
or
something
like
that
overall
a
leader
in
comparison
to
certain
peers
underappreciated
o
i
was
wondering
why
american
adjunct
lagers
never
receive
an
a
but
after
drinking
this
they
just
are
not
that
great
very
plain
but
if
its
hot
out
empty
stomach
and
the
beer
is
cold
drink
it
fast
it
might
be
allright
overall
impression
this
is
a
beer
i
have
had
occasionally
from
time
to
time
be
it
i
occasionally
reach
for
it
as
a
cheap
bargain
or
a
friend
or
family
member
has
it
around
its
in
offensive
yet
of
course
nothing
stunning
its
certainly
alot
better
then
coors
light
and
some
of
the
competition
in
american
adjunct
lagers
this
is
a
beer
meant
to
be
purchased
for
the
reasons
of
value
and
session
an
okay
beer
simply
put
d
despite
the
low
number
i
gave
on
this
it
is
actually
one
of
my
preferred
beers
when
it
comes
to
just
sitting
back
and
relaxing
very
drinkable
d
this
has
all
the
makings
of
drinkability
its
refreshing
crisp
nice
flavor
to
it
and
its
pretty
cheap
good
for
those
long
days
of
drinking
or
just
for
an
easy
beer
the
banquet
beer
takes
first
place
status
in
my
book
in
the
battle
of
bmc
very
good
for
its
style
but
if
i
were
to
choose
out
of
the
bmc
this
would
be
it
it
has
more
flavor
than
budweiser
or
miller
high
life
its
crisp
and
refreshing
its
a
satisfactory
cheap
beer
thats
great
to
drink
at
summer
cookouts
if
i
am
going
to
drink
a
domestic
big
label
this
is
it
coors
original
has
enough
flavor
to
please
my
palate
even
after
a
night
of
drinking
six
different
belgians
i
can
grab
one
of
these
to
wash
down
the
midnight
munchies
food
and
be
decently
satisfied
this
is
my
favorite
domestic
beer
to
drink
coors
has
a
great
flavor
to
it
compared
to
budweiser
or
miller
i
have
never
had
it
on
top
but
would
like
to
coors
has
a
light
crispness
to
it
a
little
better
than
budweiser
trust
me
it
isnt
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
does
taste
good
i
would
have
one
if
that
is
what
someone
gives
me
or
im
short
on
money
this
month
but
ill
stick
to
the
richer
smoother
ales
that
ive
been
enjoying
verdict
distinctive
sweet
taste
for
a
macro
nothing
too
outstanding
about
this
beer
but
it
does
have
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
for
a
macro
and
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
lager
c
2
65
pours
a
really
clear
yellow
with
a
head
that
dissolves
into
literally
nothing
looks
like
a
high
alcohol
beer
because
of
the
no
head
i
guess
it
doesnt
matter
with
appearance
of
this
beer
since
most
people
would
just
drink
this
out
of
the
can
or
bottle
anyways
i
can
smell
some
fruitiness
which
what
smells
like
to
me
belgian
yeast
strain
with
some
very
light
wheat
malt
the
taste
is
crisp
right
up
front
with
the
wheat
malt
and
belgian
yeast
combining
together
with
a
quick
flash
of
hop
which
is
so
subtle
its
barely
noticeable
until
it
warms
then
it
becomes
slightly
more
noticeable
i
can
tell
coors
makes
blue
moon
and
uses
the
same
yeast
in
that
beer
as
it
does
this
one
same
malt
too
its
so
drinkable
its
ridiculous
though
you
could
finish
this
beer
so
quickly
i
almost
think
they
dial
back
the
flavor
just
so
that
you
keep
drinking
it
more
and
faster
so
you
can
let
the
flavor
build
up
on
your
tongue
more
which
is
the
only
way
you
can
tell
what
flavors
it
has
you
also
get
your
typical
corn
smell
and
taste
in
this
as
well
but
not
as
much
as
other
adjunct
beers
i
actually
like
this
better
than
budweiser
regular
and
miller
because
of
that
slight
belgian
yeast
fruitiness
that
it
gives
off
combining
with
that
pretty
okay
subtle
wheat
malt
i
dont
know
why
youd
drink
coors
light
when
this
is
light
and
extremely
drinkable
enough
definitely
not
horrible
by
any
means
get
this
if
you
want
the
best
of
the
3
p
p
s
rating
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
enjoyment
of
this
wonderful
beer
just
marking
the
numbers
the
way
they
ought
to
be
done
per
review
if
you
like
american
lager
such
as
budweiser
you
might
enjoy
this
brew
the
apperance
is
a
light
golden
color
smell
of
grain
mostly
not
really
much
there
for
hops
the
taste
is
very
average
for
this
type
of
brew
with
a
very
light
mouthfeel
which
leads
to
a
superior
drinkability
especially
when
planning
to
some
drinking
this
beer
will
be
a
nice
choice
though
kind
of
watery
on
taste
it
is
not
filling
at
all
in
my
opinion
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
throwing
a
party
and
wants
a
decent
beer
at
a
decent
price
i
would
still
prefer
to
drink
budweiser
same
abv
and
to
me
a
much
taster
lager
pours
like
a
typical
yellow
fizzy
beer
pale
yellow
fizzy
head
without
great
retention
or
lacing
smell
actually
is
much
cleaner
than
bud
canadian
or
blue
some
grain
malt
in
the
smell
but
no
hops
at
all
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
though
overall
mild
id
drink
this
again
in
a
similar
situation
but
i
have
no
real
plans
to
have
it
a
solid
offering
from
the
coors
brewing
company
coors
banquet
is
the
best
of
the
big
three
it
has
a
full
well
rounded
flavor
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
as
it
is
a
cut
above
bud
or
miller
i
enjoy
craft
beer
and
have
a
palate
for
extreme
flavors
and
this
obviously
is
not
a
craft
beer
or
anything
extreme
in
terms
of
flavor
but
i
like
it
this
is
an
american
adjunct
lager
but
it
has
a
solid
flavor
and
body
much
better
than
its
light
sister
beer
it
definitely
has
much
more
character
and
dare
i
say
complexity
than
similar
style
full
flavor
american
adjunct
lager
beers
rjt
one
of
the
worst
out
of
the
three
bmc
better
than
a
finger
of
white
foam
which
lasted
more
than
a
minute
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
glass
with
good
cling
color
is

its

the

a
little
more
refined
i
stress
a
bit
better
obviously
this
beer
is
designed
for

consumption
but
its
not
quite
as
smooth
as
some
of
its

or
even

for
that

basically
not
a

this

overall
a

doesnt
hold
up

to

best
consumed
mindlessly
on

if
this
is
the

this
under
duress
ba
it
tastes
like
water
and
it
is
only
good
for
parties
with
high
volume
it
isnt
the
greatest
thing
but
isnt
the
worst
cheap
its
swill
really
still
not
bad
tastes
ok
when
people
give
things
like
this
a
1
or
2
what
are
they
comparing
it
to
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
but
no
head
smells
like
highly
fermented
corn
a
little
sweet
and
some
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
highly
carbonated
going
down
overall
2
02
pissed
i
spilled
it
all
over
my
reloading
desk
its
not
great
not
terrible
but
almost
words
cannot
describe
the
horrible
taste
of
this
beer
if
id
call
it
beer
i
picked
up
a
tallboy
on
my
way
home
from
work
i
popped
the
top
and
had
me
a
few
swigs
before
throwing
that
nasty
stuff
out
the
window
into
the
ditch
tastes
like
watered
down
milky
fruit
loops
dont
waste
your
99cents
served
in
a
pint
glass
keystone
ice
is
an
ice
brew
made
by
coors
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
can
says
always
smoothnot
as
smooth
as
the
light
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
for
being
5
9
avb
nothing
much
different
from
your
other
ice
brews
on
the
market
there
are
worse
cheap
swillsmalt
liquors
to
be
had
so
this
is
not
the
worst
cheapy
swill
out
there
but
it
is
as
i
say
very
industrial
and
a
bit
harsh
after
2
or
3
and
ive
noticed
the
hangover
can
be
pretty
gruesome
if
you
pound
a
bunch
of
it
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
and
pale
yellowgold
color
aroma
is
grainy
chemicals
and
faintly
vomitlike
and
not
much
else
flavor
is
corny
vegetal
grainy
and
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
light
overcarbonated
and
rough
although
the
can
says
it
is
smooth
no
mass
produced
beer
that
i
have
ever
tasted
that
boldly
claimed
it
was
smooth
on
the
label
actually
was
overall
it
is
a
cheap
way
to
get
drunk
and
not
much
else
overall
this
was
the
old
standby
for
the
college
beer
fridge
and
is
just
a
beer
you
buy
when
you
want
to
get
drunk
overall
a
pretty
good
ice
beer
thats
stronger
than
some
malt
liquors
and
easier
to
drink
than
some
brandname
light
beers
i
did
not
try
this
one
in
a
glass
i
dont
think
their
is
a
sutable
glass
for
it
anyway
it
smells
like
cornrice
it
taste
like
cornrice
and
it
has
one
of
the
most
present
tastes
of
alcohol
of
any
beer
ive
ever
drank
making
it
not
so
easy
to
enjoy
ice
cold
from
the
cooler
and
drank
with
an
open
mind
this
beer
to
me
reminded
me
of
a
whiskey
taste
mixed
with
a
glass
of
ice
that
had
been
melting
for
awhile
im
not
bashing
its
just
not
that
good
to
me
probably
my
least
favorite
of
all
light
bodied
too
much
carbonation
and
poorly
made
not
sure
who
likes
drinking
this
or
why
its
still
around
they
probably
sell
a
lot
of
this
on
april
fools
day
overall
as
a
party
lets
get
drink
for
cheap
beverage
it
works
people
dont
buy
this
expecting
to
be
blown
away
especially
when
the
tall
boys
are
2
for
2
22
when
i
drink
this
beer
theres
an
intangible
quality
i
can
sense
i
cant
explain
it
but
its
the
feeling
that
if
you
drink
a
lot
of
this
you
will
feel
like
death
the
next
morning
o
overall
this
was
a
good
adjunct
very
sessionable
and
it
would
be
great
for
a
party
at
1
59
for
a
24oz
can
id
have
it
again
in
a
party
scenario
now
remember
im
not
somebody
who
simply
bashes
an
aal
because
its
an
aal
i
give
every
beer
a
fair
review
and
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
better
adjuncts
that
ive
had
o
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
interesting
flavors
unless
you
like
adjunct
malts
and
apple
juice
o
crisp
and
refreshing
actually
better
than
i
expected
after
smelling
this
beer
certainly
not
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
again
but
not
as
bad
as
expected
or
remembered
from
college
in
the
mid1990s
theres
very
little
to
report
here
the
flavor
is
sweet
corn
and
grains
when
its
ice
cold
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
and
quickly
not
something
i
would
buy
again
o
keystone
ice
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
is
the
macro
ice
lager
i
would
use
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
although
bud
ice
is
smoother
it
has
less
character
costs
more
is
harder
to
find
and
has
less
impact
drunkenness
for
ice
beers
available
to
me
keystone
ice
is
the
winner
overall
it
really
has
nothing
going
for
it
except
its
crispness
this
would
be
good
for
right
after
a
run
or
hard
bike
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
want
something
without
too
complex
a
body
and
that
is
very
crisp
and
easy
to
sit
relax
and
cool
down
with
ov
while
its
easy
to
criticize
adjunct
lagers
this
beer
is
effective
at
achieving
a
moderate
buzz
thanks
to
the
higher
abv
this
will
forever
be
immortalized
as
long
as
there
are
frat
parties
in
existence
it
appeals
to
the
younger
inexperienced
and
to
the
bargain
hunters
you
could
easily
buy
a
similar
beer
and
not
feel
a
thing
at
least
with
this
you
are
guaranteed
some
kind
of
result
while
staying
at
this
price
point
i
would
rather
recommend
an
old
milwaukee
or
pbr
if
flavor
becomes
a
higher
priority
well
pretty
much
what
i
expected
here
its
drinkable
sure
but
the
only
highlight
i
can
tell
you
about
drinking
this
is
that
it
has
5
9
abv
of
which
i
keep
staring
at
as
i
drink
this
its
sweet
metallic
has
some
corn
in
it
and
looks
like
malt
liquor
the
can
says
it
is
specially
lined
i
wonder
what
is
so
special
about
the
liner
and
why
it
needs
to
be
mentioned
on
the
can
overall
a
great
ice
beer
made
by
coors
ill
be
sure
to
grab
another
24
ounce
can
for
1
25
for
an
affordable
buzzz
for
the
fact
it
does
not
taste
horrible
i
will
mark
it
down
like
many
others
as
something
to
get
a
buzz
on
but
at
least
drinkable
to
a
degree
i
cannot
wait
till
i
can
afford
better
beer
again
apparently
just
opening
the
can
has
resurrective
properties
gonna
have
to
try
this
tomorrow
with
the
inevitable
hangover
this
beer
will
cause
overall
a
terrible
beer
of
this
style
but
if
youre
looking
to
get
smashed
its
an
ok
option
i
almost
poured
mine
down
the
drain
but
felt
the
alcohol
coming
on
and
decided
to
finish
it
based
solely
on
that
i
drank
this
beer
because
im
a
sucker
for
cheap
beer
and
it
was
offered
to
me
by
a
friend
im
too
polite
to
be
such
a
snob
that
i
turn
someone
away
because
their
tastes
are
not
as
refined
as
mine
i
didnt
enjoy
it
but
its
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
drank
o
no
i
dont
want
another
but
if
its
there
and
you
want
to
get
drunk
then
it
will
do
the
job
not
a
good
beer
purchased
at
a
circle
k
in
the
ville
aka
steubenville
oh
price
check
if
anybody
cares
a
dollar
69
not
much
more
booze
than
your
typical
malt
lager
but
this
is
an
iced
version
of
keystone
appears
in
the
most
non
descript
form
of
a
yellow
fizzy
lager
plop
plop
fizzes
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
white
head
dwindles
pretty
rapidly
even
while
your
pouring
the
beer
the
head
races
to
meet
the
body
wtf
i
guess
a
true
college
beer
drinker
knows
how
to
pour
a
beer
without
any
or
much
head
more
beer
right
aroma
has
a
pure
cooked
corncereal
grain
aroma
faint
muddled
herbal
quality
not
quite
hops
flavor
wise
a
pretty
srong
cereal
grain
infusion
of
ricemaltscorn
with
a
bitter
unpleasant
offbeat
singing
through
the
melody
of
unconditioned
and
off
put
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
rough
heavy
carbonation
filling
my
senses
this
is
tough
sipping
beer
from
a
tallboy
can
overall
i
drank
most
of
this
not
sure
the
portion
that
i
didnt
get
down
but
ive
seen
much
worse
but
this
isnt
aiming
its
sights
very
high
a
really
mediocre
brew
that
is
put
out
there
with
extremly
low
expectations
although
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
hate
its
better
than
other
ice
lagers
on
the
market
the
appearance
is
nothing
special
but
the
flavor
is
far
less
offensive
than
other
ice
lagers
if
youre
strapped
for
cash
and
want
something
smooth
this
brew
is
a
decent
buy
from
a
can
marked
oct1011bo8060639
the
pour
is
yellow
with
no
head
and
busy
carbonation
the
aroma
is
more
subtle
than
many
ice
beers
with
a
crispy
hoppiness
sneaking
up
on
the
nose
but
little
in
the
way
of
malts
plenty
of
corn
and
adjuncts
the
body
is
thin
the
taste
is
a
tad
mellower
than
i
expected
but
otherwise
it
is
mainly
corn
metal
and
a
weak
hop
factor
its
a
macro
ice
beer
what
do
you
expect
better
than
some
though
i
only
drink
this
when
one
of
my
friends
friends
friend
ends
up
bringing
it
to
a
party
this
beer
is
really
only
good
for
beer
pong
tastes
pretty
bad
when
it
gets
warm
but
your
drinking
it
to
get
drunk
not
to
enjoy
if
this
was
left
over
after
a
party
id
make
them
disappear
but
i
would
never
use
my
hard
earned
cash
for
this
brew
this
beer
is
cheap
but
it
lacks
taste
and
what
it
has
is
a
very
inoffensive
cornrice
taste
so
to
sum
it
up
it
goes
down
easy
and
gets
you
drunk
as
long
as
you
have
no
expectations
now
if
i
was
comparing
this
to
a
good
quality
craft
beer
id
probably
give
it
a
d
the
finish
leaves
a
mouthfeel
that
coats
your
mouth
and
makes
you
want
to
spit
a
lot
over
all
im
not
impressed
but
somebody
left
it
in
my
fridge
and
i
wouldnt
let
one
go
to
waste
o
i
stopped
at
a
gas
station
and
looked
for
the
highest
abv
not
a
lot
of
options
ok
seriously
its
head
disappeared
within
a
couple
seconds
of
pouring
never
seen
that
happen
before
it
poured
a
clear
bright
yellow
i
thought
it
smelled
strongly
of
green
apples
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
high
carbonation
it
tastes
like
bread
essentially
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
tasted
more
of
bread
than
corn
or
of
alcohol
the
aftertaste
is
almost
the
same
as
the
aftertaste
after
youve
eaten
a
slice
of
an
89
cent
loaf
of
wheat
bread
so
for
the
price
its
almost
worth
it
one
problem
it
gives
me
terrible
heartburn
before
ive
ever
finished
the
can
never
experienced
that
with
any
other
beer
before
ive
had
problems
with
heartburn
before
but
never
before
finishing
a
single
can
of
beer
not
sure
whats
in
this
stuff
that
causes
such
a
problem
but
for
me
that
makes
it
not
worth
paying
any
money
for
a
good
alternative
big
flats
1901
it
has
more
flavour
doesnt
feel
weird
in
your
throat
or
stomach
and
is
cheaper
yes
i
said
cheaper
hard
to
beat
that
logic
pours
a
very
light
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
sweet
corn
and
maybe
rice
tastes
very
light
with
no
bitterness
and
a
lot
of
corn
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
and
has
a
very
heavy
carbonation
overall
pretty
nasty
i
do
fine
this
pretty
easy
to
tolerate
drinking
but
the
nasty
astringent
flavors
in
there
lead
me
to
believe
drinking
too
many
of
these
would
be
quite
regrettable
later
on
p
s
theyve
updated
the
can
since
the
profile
pic
here
was
taken
now
its
upside
down
to
conceal
your
shame
that
others
will
see
the
swill
youre
intaking
cheers
d
ice
tends
to
be
synonymous
with
horrendous
in
terms
of
beer
and
this
can
did
nothing
to
change
that
keystone
ice
just
really
doesnt
get
along
with
my
palette
i
guess
it
is
a
beer
i
will
never
buy
again
if
its
free
and
the
only
option
then
ill
definitely
be
the
d
d
for
the
night
either
my
palate
now
welcomes
the
style
or
im
starting
to
find
examples
that
seem
to
fit
it
best
as
cheap
as
this
is
i
already
prefer
it
to
natty
ice
it
is
an
ice
beer
after
all
theres
a
beer
for
all
income
brackets
and
though
this
is
not
as
cheap
as
mountain
brew
ice
it
is
just
as
tasty
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
total
waste
i
found
more
taste
in
an
odouls
hard
to
drink
beer
very
cheap
and
somewhat
strong
im
having
a
very
hard
time
drinking
this
beer
avoid
definately
d
i
poured
it
out
to
spare
my
self
the
calories
i
will
not
have
another
not
even
for
beer
pong
and
flip
cup
as
far
as
appearance
i
had
this
stuff
at
poker
night
in
college
so
its
hard
to
tell
the
appearance
of
a
beer
in
a
red
plastic
cup
however
on
the
pour
there
was
almost
no
head
except
for
some
oily
looking
foam
clinging
in
sparse
areas
of
the
surface
of
my
beer
and
the
color
of
the
pour
was
very
similar
to
say
well
lets
just
say
this
beer
must
have
been
dehydrated
and
taking
its
b
vitamins
cause
it
looked
and
smelled
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
initially
no
different
than
any
other
macro
brew
which
is
to
say
there
isnt
much
of
anything
going
on
here
on
the
finish
it
seems
to
mutate
into
something
altogether
different
leaving
a
funky
coating
on
the
palate
and
a
bit
of
a
sharp
bite
in
the
back
of
the
throat
that
could
be
the
vodka
theyre
pouring
in
this
stuff
to
up
the
alcohol
content
not
seriously
by
the
way
but
it
feels
like
it
the
taste
is
only
what
can
be
described
as
unbearable
although
i
did
bear
it
that
night
and
succeeded
in
getting
pretty
hammered
off
the
stuff
is
its
one
redeeming
quality
which
leads
me
to
the
point
i
am
today
one
of
my
college
buddies
bought
a
case
of
it
and
after
opening
the
can
i
knew
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
pull
another
night
off
with
this
one
i
literally
swallowed
a
chug
of
the
beer
and
it
immediately
reversed
directions
and
well
you
can
imagine
im
just
glad
i
was
close
to
the
trash
can
d
how
can
people
drink
this
i
gave
this
a
2
0
drink
ability
rating
because
its
a
damn
it
i
wanna
die
so
lets
get
drunk
chug
this
sucker
type
of
beer
d
a
rare
example
of
where
the
light
version
is
distinguishably
better
than
the
nonlight
you
can
drink
this
stuff
its
not
bad
for
the
price
but
its
definately
not
anything
special
what
would
you
expect
thoough
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
there
is
really
odd
meat
flavor
in
the
the
finish
of
the
beer
making
it
unpleasant
and
a
drain
pour
rjt
this
is
one
for
if
you
just
want
to
get
really
trashed
and
dont
care
about
beer
at
all
if
you
want
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
water
then
heres
your
beer
overall
if
you
could
keep
this
cold
for
more
than
30
seconds
it
could
be
a
bit
less
bad
if
you
must
just
shotgun
overall
worth
two
bucks
and
a
quarter
when
times
are
bad
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
taste
since
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
it
isnt
as
bad
as
the
bad
appearance
and
aroma
mouthfeel
doesnt
leave
anything
bad
aftertaste
i
guess
of
cornmeal
drinkability
rates
high
hey
its
cheap
and
since
its
like
alcohol
water
its
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
why
you
would
want
to
di
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
i
could
also
cut
my
hair
with
a
weedwacker
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
a
good
idea
this
is
for
people
who
want
a
cheap
quick
buzz
if
you
chug
it
i
suppose
i
didnt
chug
it
and
was
able
to
get
through
the
whole
24
oz
can
some
shortlived
sweetness
lingered
in
the
end
a
cheap
macro
with
a
bit
of
booze
bought
a
24
ounce
can
for
1
35
poured
from
can
appears
like
most
other
lagars
pale
yellow
lots
of
carbonated
bubbles
strong
smell
of
corn
lots
of
corn
sugar
and
yeast
in
the
flavor
somewhat
stale
flavor
no
real
malts
or
hops
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
pretty
watery
drinkability
in
one
word
no
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
mild
smell
some
malts
taste
is
lacking
some
malts
finishing
a
bit
metallic
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
not
a
whole
lot
to
like
about
this
one
d
i
suppose
if
its
ice
cold
its
at
least
drinkable
this
beer
is
what
it
is
a
really
cheap
buzz
bear
that
you
can
buy
in
large
quantities
at
gas
stations
and
grocery
stores
a
beer
pong
beer
in
my
book
really
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
im
not
one
of
those
people
that
is
unwilling
to
drink
macro
light
beers
i
dont
mind
an
occasional
coors
or
bud
light
with
some
chicken
wings
that
being
said
i
would
never
want
to
drink
this
outside
of
a
college
party
and
even
then
not
really
pale
crystal
clear
straw
with
a
mediumsized
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
of
weak
malts
light
yeast
and
veggie
taste
follows
very
adjunct
flavor
finish
is
crisp
with
light
fruity
whisps
of
fruit
on
the
finish
something
actually
enjoyable
but
as
you
go
the
finish
turns
chalky
and
husky
it
looks
cheap
it
tastes
cheap
but
as
long
as
thats
what
youre
going
for
its
not
terrible
is
it
a
good
beer
ha
but
in
the
category
of
american
adjunct
lager
its
not
bad
so
keeping
style
in
mind
i
wont
blast
this
beer
appearance
from
this
24
oz
can
is
straw
in
color
with
a
crisp
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
has
light
adjunct
but
clean
taste
of
slightly
sweet
corn
watered
down
with
a
light
bitter
bite
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
drinkable
cheap
buzz
whats
the
deal
with
ice
brews
keystone
premium
is
awful
keystone
light
is
worse
so
why
not
stop
there
the
abv
is
higher
but
that
doesnt
make
this
any
better
this
beer
is
watery
and
not
much
else
good
can
be
said
about
it
others
have
said
it
better
than
i
can
mouthfeel
is
weak
taste
is
atrocious
and
poured
appearance
is
without
obvious
merit
drinkability
is
not
improved
by
a
higher
abv
the
beer
is
a
very
light
gold
the
color
is
about
as
deep
as
sunlight
lots
of
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
but
the
head
dies
within
seconds
the
smell
holds
the
slight
burn
of
carbonation
and
hints
of
cheap
beer
adjunctness
the
alcohol
really
takes
over
the
beer
in
the
taste
its
really
sweet
with
a
hint
of
sour
adjuncts
the
carbonation
gets
the
back
of
your
throat
there
are
thinner
beers
out
there
and
i
could
drink
the
hell
out
of
it
but
i
dont
really
want
to
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
that
is
very
light
there
is
a
very
slight
head
to
it
the
smell
is
of
alcohol
and
grain
the
taste
is
of
alcohol
and
grain
the
taste
is
very
stingy
it
is
very
harsh
to
drink
taste
wise
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
very
harsh
the
drinkability
on
this
is
very
low
it
is
harsh
and
stings
of
alcohol
good
if
you
are
in
college
i
guess
nevertheless
keystone
ice
as
a
beer
on
its
own
doesnt
cut
it
but
what
did
you
expect
from
coors
as
i
poured
the
white
head
bubbled
and
fizzed
like
soda
pop
and
had
retention
commensurate
with
pop
none
that
left
me
with
a
glass
of
goldenyellow
beer
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
had
a
sweet
candylike
quality
to
it
not
lagersweet
but
candysweet
oof
pressing
on
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
with
a
bubble
gum
sweetness
coupled
with
an
alcohol
heat
on
the
tongue
finish
had
an
unpleasant
astringency
i
was
glad
that
i
was
eating
along
with
drinking
this
could
have
been
a
drain
pour
otherwise
d
i
suppose
for
a
higher
gravity
cheap
beer
got
it
for
50
cents
otherwise
id
never
try
it
its
ok
on
the
drinkability
level
even
if
the
alcohol
is
a
tad
low
for
an
ice
but
i
could
see
this
leaving
one
huge
headache
in
its
wake
i
was
able
to
finish
6
of
them
despite
the
horrible
taste
i
would
never
want
to
have
this
again
maybe
im
in
a
darn
fine
mood
with
the
80
degrees
and
golf
coming
up
but
this
was
a
easy
drinking
adjunct
lager
as
far
as
cheap
beer
goes
i
have
always
had
a
big
forgivability
towards
the
keystone
brand
picture
mcdonalds
fries
poured
into
a
can
however
even
though
this
ale
was
dirt
cheap
it
was
a
real
task
to
drink
on
its
own
hindsite
being
2020
it
turns
out
that
i
dont
care
how
little
i
pay
for
a
can
of
suds
when
i
feel
a
little
like
vomiting
after
every
drink
that
i
take
unless
you
are
just
getting
this
stuff
to
put
a
beer
into
your
obnoxious
cousins
hand
to
make
him
shutup
and
passout
then
dont
bother
paying
for
the
shit
im
doing
this
review
strictly
for
curiousitys
sake
this
beer
was
a
transparent
light
yellow
with
a
big
and
quicklyfading
head
after
a
vigorous
pour
lets
not
split
hairs
here
this
is
a
beer
for
homeless
people
that
cant
manage
to
stumble
into
a
place
that
sells
thunderbird
or
mad
dog
every
so
often
college
kids
will
also
buy
it
to
be
ironic
and
then
theyll
pop
their
collars
and
high
five
and
then
drink
a
case
of
this
swill
and
suck
each
others
dicks
the
taste
is
as
neutral
as
they
could
get
with
almost
six
percent
alcohol
theres
some
corn
theres
some
alcohol
theres
some
lingering
regret
the
good
news
is
that
if
you
chug
enough
of
it
it
begins
to
taste
like
water
and
that
daytime
hooker
begins
to
look
less
like
a
postop
tranny
if
its
cold
enough
you
could
almost
mistake
the
mouthfeel
for
beer
and
the
drinkability
for
something
rivaling
a
refreshing
beverage
this
is
a
beer
that
would
make
the
people
who
purchase
it
sad
if
they
still
had
the
capacity
for
that
type
of
emotion
i
would
drink
this
as
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
very
hot
day
or
if
i
wanted
to
get
hammered
for
less
than
4
bucks
i
cant
say
anything
nice
about
it
except
that
it
doesnt
look
terrible
for
a
cheap
beer
it
pours
nicely
and
looks
ok
in
a
beer
pong
cup
thats
about
it
terrible
taste
overall
a
pretty
decent
buy
at
14
a
30
pack
i
cant
stomach
this
type
of
beer
ice
beer
only
has
the
quality
of
being
more
alcoholic
than
regular
beer
it
sacrifices
flavor
for
alcohol
beer
should
not
be
about
getting
drunk
but
rather
the
flavor
therefore
this
is
the
opposite
of
what
beer
should
be
taste
water
corn
and
sugar
which
is
probably
the
three
main
ingredients
pours
a
little
more
gold
than
yellow
as
if
someone
ate
a
lot
of
carrots
before
they
peed
in
the
can
aroma
is
extrasugary
corn
syrup
weird
the
taste
is
beyond
bad
tons
of
grain
and
metal
with
a
heaping
of
sugar
the
beer
does
have
more
heft
to
it
than
its
cousins
and
that
is
not
a
good
thing
you
will
get
drunk
quickly
on
this
stuff
though
and
sick
just
as
fast
of
drinking
it
this
is
honestly
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
pours
a
pale
yellow
high
carbonation
quickly
dissipating
head
i
find
no
redeeming
factors
about
its
flavor
aroma
or
appearance
other
than
its
5
9
alcohol
level
which
makes
it
good
for
beer
pong
just
getting
this
rating
out
of
the
way
can
12
oz
strong
malty
aroma
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
that
dissipates
quickly
not
a
lot
of
bubbles
form
on
the
glass
sweet
flavor
that
hits
quickly
goes
down
smooth
and
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
after
the
sweetness
is
gone
theres
really
no
flavor
or
body
to
this
beer
speaking
as
a
college
student
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
4
99
for
a
12
pack
of
5
9
beer
d
honestly
it
just
doesnt
taste
good
decent
beer
for
someone
that
wants
to
pound
beers
and
get
drunk
quick
ive
been
to
college
and
i
know
this
beer
has
a
place
nothing
terrible
about
this
beer
but
nothing
great
about
it
i
bought
this
at
a
barbeer
joint
here
in
ktown
1
25
per
24
oz
can
cheapest
stuff
in
the
store
and
that
was
my
first
mistake
yuck
thats
my
one
word
review
it
is
not
even
worth
running
down
the
list
of
appearance
smell
etc
the
only
reason
this
is
still
being
made
is
so
poor
college
students
or
bums
can
get
drunk
quick
bottom
line
dont
buy
unless
you
are
really
short
on
cash
drinkability
tastes
bad
and
with
an
abv
of
5
90
this
beer
serves
one
purpose
it
gets
ya
drunk
if
you
want
an
ice
beer
this
is
the
best
that
being
said
this
beer
is
crap
tastes
like
liquid
aluminum
smells
like
bunghole
just
a
bad
brew
all
around
i
do
believe
it
is
the
best
ice
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
i
am
not
100
on
what
an
ice
beer
really
is
all
i
knw
is
this
one
tasted
the
least
like
death
its
not
great
but
when
compared
to
other
ice
beers
keystone
ice
is
one
of
the
better
ones
taste
as
with
all
ice
beers
is
of
lesser
importance
than
low
price
and
high
alcohol
content
12
pack
5
99
with
a
5
9
av
youre
getting
a
cheap
buzz
here
and
thats
what
ice
beers
are
for
however
some
do
taste
better
than
others
keystone
ice
is
much
better
than
say
natural
ice
and
milwaukees
best
ice
arguably
the
the
worst
beer
ive
had
keystone
ice
has
no
offensive
smell
it
actually
is
smooth
taste
is
corn
alcohol
and
the
can
with
an
aftertaste
that
is
popularly
described
as
bananalike
i
wont
get
into
color
head
or
any
appearance
qualities
because
in
my
opinion
ice
beers
should
be
left
in
the
can
or
bottle
they
come
in
pouring
them
into
a
glass
for
further
examination
not
only
further
reveals
their
cheapness
it
actually
can
make
them
taste
worse
it
seems
a
little
pointless
to
go
into
detail
about
ice
beers
i
doubt
most
of
those
that
consume
them
regularly
put
much
thought
into
it
still
if
youre
going
to
buy
one
you
might
as
well
get
one
you
dont
have
to
choke
down
i
made
the
mistake
of
drinking
24
of
these
in
a
sitting
not
long
ago
and
that
is
a
mistake
i
will
not
be
making
again
anytime
soon
however
as
far
as
ice
beers
this
one
tasted
better
than
most
i
have
tried
this
is
definitely
a
one
of
for
me
as
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
even
if
all
the
craft
brews
suddenly
disappeared
this
can
of
ice
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
and
has
a
poor
white
head
the
nose
is
of
grainy
malt
and
stale
bitter
hops
the
taste
is
super
light
with
some
corn
in
there
body
is
watery
and
over
carbonated
this
stuff
is
quite
similar
to
keystones
other
beers
they
are
all
equally
bad
what
do
you
expect
for
the
price
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
though
and
if
you
like
the
taste
of
alcohol
itself
go
for
it
verdict
a
cheap
college
beer
one
whose
only
purpose
is
to
fuel
200am
beer
pong
games
drinkability
surprisingly
tolerable
for
a
cheap
canned
macro
lager
you
cant
spell
nice
with
ice
baby
a
while
back
had
keystone
light
so
when
i
was
offered
a
can
of
their
ice
decided
to
give
it
a
go
this
one
is
noticeably
sweeter
than
the
lighter
version
a
certain
gasolinesweetness
pours
through
and
the
decent
5
9
abv
for
a
macro
wasnt
bad
either
not
the
best
american
selection
for
the
style
but
not
too
horrible
either
appearance
and
smell
were
not
impressive
at
all
and
the
taste
got
a
slight
boost
for
the
apparent
sugar
element
mouthfeel
was
oily
and
drinkability
was
average
at
best
for
this
styles
representation
not
bad
for
the
money
but
there
is
much
better
to
choose
from
overall
an
unappetizing
macro
that
i
wont
be
drinking
again
not
so
much
a
beer
as
an
alcohol
delivery
system
its
not
undrinkable
in
fact
its
not
unobectionable
in
terms
of
quality
as
it
sets
out
to
do
what
its
meant
to
do
but
theres
not
much
point
to
drinking
it
either
unless
you
feel
you
are
in
need
of
an
alcohol
delivery
system
and
nothing
else
i
suppose
it
fills
a
niche
for
fratboys
who
want
to
tell
themselves
that
theyre
a
badass
for
drinking
a
beer
thats
nearly
6
alcohol
tough
to
review
i
feel
that
i
have
a
cast
iron
palate
when
it
comes
to
drinking
beer
i
almost
exclusively
drink
high
gravity
lagers
because
it
has
the
most
bang
for
the
buck
i
would
prefer
to
drink
quality
micro
beers
and
imports
but
they
are
too
expensive
to
drink
regularly
i
would
consider
myself
somewhat
of
a
beer
connoisseur
i
can
drink
rot
gut
vodka
straight
without
any
problems
but
yet
i
would
have
to
say
keystone
ice
is
one
of
the
most
repulsive
beers
i
have
ever
tried
the
first
time
i
ever
tried
it
i
can
honestly
say
i
thought
it
could
possibly
be
contaminated
or
something
like
that
and
considered
contacting
the
brewery
i
tried
it
months
later
and
the
results
were
the
same
the
taste
is
very
metallic
and
chemical
you
know
its
beer
only
by
the
faint
hint
of
fermented
grain
anyone
who
says
this
is
an
ok
beer
is
a
liar
this
beer
is
a
beer
for
the
ages
the
extremely
pale
yellow
color
is
not
very
appetizing
and
the
smell
is
kind
of
pungeant
not
very
much
of
anything
good
going
on
here
except
the
price
real
cheap
and
it
will
get
you
drunk
very
fast
the
mouthfeel
is
alot
like
keystone
light
it
is
really
flat
and
could
use
more
carbonation
to
make
it
better
as
for
its
drinkability
it
is
not
drinkable
at
all
it
hurts
going
down
and
does
not
make
me
want
any
more
the
black
can
is
pretty
cool
though
could
drink
a
good
amount
of
these
if
you
can
handle
the
taste
this
beer
is
a
light
yellow
clear
with
little
head
i
gave
it
a
three
for
appearance
because
the
active
carbonation
in
my
larry
the
cable
guy
pilsner
glass
is
entertaining
if
nothing
else
the
smell
is
corny
and
as
i
have
noticed
before
in
a
few
brews
the
smell
of
machined
cast
aluminum
is
present
the
taste
is
corn
rice
and
a
slight
hint
of
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
this
beer
as
is
most
of
the
style
is
easy
to
drink
and
nonfilling
a
lot
of
people
bash
this
style
but
i
for
one
think
it
has
a
place
12
of
these
would
be
no
challenge
on
a
night
of
camping
d
not
bad
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
now
that
ive
reviewed
it
if
i
want
and
ice
beer
to
chug
on
a
hot
day
ill
take
icehouse
over
this
unless
i
see
a
24
ozer
for
99
cents
again
the
can
tells
me
that
keystone
ice
is
always
smooth
i
beg
to
differ
the
mouthfeel
isnt
full
enough
to
be
smooth
and
the
flavor
is
one
of
the
rockiest
most
gutwrenching
rides
that
ive
taken
in
quite
some
time
my
suggestion
is
that
if
you
find
yourself
with
no
other
choice
make
sure
the
can
is
ice
cold
on
second
thought
put
the
sucker
in
the
freezer
until
it
actually
turns
to
ice
and
then
throw
it
away
nothing
is
going
to
make
it
easier
to
get
this
one
down
not
much
flavor
here
maybe
recommend
at
summer
outings
where
the
goal
is
to
get
bit
fast
but
thats
about
it
look
for
flavor
from
milwaukees
best
ice
that
at
least
tastes
macro
beer
a
bit
with
some
flavor
and
will
get
you
just
as
tipsy
get
my
buzz
on
n
if
what
you
want
is
to
get
a
buzz
it
is
goood
for
that
i
have
had
alot
of
beers
this
isint
best
but
the
effect
is
good
i
guess
if
you
are
in
a
financial
strap
hold
go
for
it
there
is
nothing
much
to
say
about
it
i
like
that
i
can
get
30
stones
and
pay
like
15
bucks
for
them
keystone
ice
pours
a
typical
macro
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
sixteen
ounce
can
smell
is
a
cross
between
musty
and
estery
at
first
then
just
corn
tastes
like
corn
but
considerably
worse
than
a
typical
macro
it
has
some
off
flavors
that
i
cant
really
identify
bad
can
you
say
drain
pour
if
worse
comes
to
worse
and
youre
stuck
with
a
selection
of
mass
produced
beers
grab
a
12pack
of
keystone
ice
youll
survive
until
your
next
trip
to
the
specialty
shop
bottom
line
if
you
are
on
a
budget
and
need
to
get
your
buzz
on
this
will
do
the
trick
dont
drink
this
one
for
the
flavor
but
for
the
effect
overall
id
say
one
of
the
better
of
its
kind
ice
crap
one
thing
that
i
find
interesting
is
the
can
says
ice
brewed
ale
what
the
hell
does
that
mean
this
is
one
i
dont
really
care
to
have
much
at
all
but
in
all
honesty
for
the
price
and
knowing
how
other
beers
of
its
like
taste
it
aint
so
bad
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
large
white
puffy
head
good
retention
but
almost
no
lacing
to
be
found
smell
is
slightly
sweet
but
virtually
nothing
else
taste
in
so
minimal
as
to
be
nonexistant
finish
is
ciold
and
refreshing
too
strong
to
be
a
spacer
but
not
a
bad
all
around
beer
sort
of
reminds
me
of
beer
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
to
get
drunk
not
to
enjoy
it
is
by
far
the
best
ice
beer
i
have
had
to
date
it
doesnt
have
that
cheep
vodka
added
flavor
that
most
ice
beers
have
buy
this
over
bud
ice
its
cheaper
and
better
tasting
the
high
taste
and
mouthfeel
numbers
are
because
this
is
being
ranked
against
similar
style
beers
if
it
was
against
all
beers
i
would
probably
give
it
a
1
5
total
i
read
all
of
the
comments
from
college
students
saying
why
they
buy
bad
beers
i
usually
drink
bad
beers
because
my
dad
offers
them
to
me
and
i
dont
want
to
offend
him
so
i
accept
them
keystone
ice
is
pretty
rough
it
tastes
like
aluminum
foil
it
smells
like
corn
rice
and
aluminum
foil
it
looks
pale
yellow
and
fizzy
i
guess
i
actually
drank
it
from
the
can
there
is
some
alcohol
in
there
so
i
guess
it
really
is
beer
just
not
good
beer
has
a
grainy
metalic
bloodlike
finish
just
a
weak
flavor
and
harsh
texture
this
is
not
a
beer
for
beer
drinkers
pseudoaficionados
poseurs
whoever
this
is
a
beer
for
people
who
want
cheap
inebriation
but
for
whaterver
reason
dont
want
malt
liquor
i
dont
know
what
it
looks
like
because
nobody
who
buys
this
stuff
would
pour
it
into
a
glass
lightly
hopped
it
has
the
mouthfeel
of
water
that
has
been
lubricated
with
the
syrup
of
unfermentable
sugars
i
will
say
that
it
doesnt
taste
at
all
alcoholic
and
at
almost
6abv
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
all
you
have
to
do
is
walk
around
a
college
town
after
a
football
game
and
see
empty
cans
of
keystone
ice
lining
the
streets
to
understand
what
kind
of
brew
this
is
came
in
a
cool
skinny
can
silver
and
black
a
very
streamlined
beer
drinking
experience
when
enjoyed
from
the
can
i
came
into
the
room
with
this
poured
in
a
glass
though
and
my
dad
asked
me
if
i
had
pissed
in
the
glass
doesnt
taste
as
quite
as
bad
as
piss
though
this
pours
a
pee
yellow
with
no
head
the
armoa
is
sorta
chemically
but
besides
that
barely
detectable
the
taste
is
nothing
special
it
is
what
you
would
expect
from
an
ice
beer
this
one
is
very
inoffensive
i
would
only
drink
this
when
i
wanted
to
get
smashed
though
nothing
in
the
area
of
taste
here
that
can
be
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
was
blah
fairly
drinkable
a
heavier
version
of
its
light
brother
poured
out
to
a
medium
yellow
color
with
medium
high
carbonation
no
head
to
speak
of
dissipated
quite
fast
odors
of
chemical
and
malt
were
noted
as
was
a
scent
of
alcohol
that
hung
around
flavor
was
minimally
tolerable
with
overtones
of
corn
water
and
alcohol
for
an
ice
beer
i
guess
its
ok
but
id
much
rather
have
a
schlitz
or
coors
when
i
got
home
and
took
my
first
sip
i
was
pleasanty
suprised
this
was
a
damn
smooth
tasting
brew
quenched
my
thirst
for
damn
sure
for
both
a
buzz
and
literally
i
recommend
this
brew
for
anyone
after
a
cheap
beer
that
tastes
decent
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
most
other
macrolagers
and
a
better
price
i
rate
these
kind
of
beers
compared
to
the
others
in
the
category
and
with
regards
to
its
true
purpose
catching
a
tasty
buzz
you
probably
know
about
what
to
expect
pale
yellow
adjuct
laden
ice
beer
taste
that
being
said
this
is
one
of
the
better
tasting
brews
of
this
style
or
shoud
i
say
its
not
as
bad
as
the
others
this
is
not
drinkable
for
me
a
drain
pour
if
you
must
have
a
horribly
cheap
ice
beer
go
for
icehouse
pours
out
of
the
can
a
golden
straw
colour
with
an
artificial
thin
foamy
head
and
sparse
lace
aroma
is
more
of
the
that
fruit
like
banana
not
unlike
a
box
of
fruit
loops
some
mild
adjuncty
graininess
too
medium
spritzy
mouthfeel
somewhat
watery
and
minerally
taste
is
ghost
like
graininess
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
nothing
else
this
is
better
than
keystone
premium
but
still
pretty
bad
compared
to
other
ice
brews
double
blech
not
a
lot
going
on
here
but
if
you
want
to
go
slumming
go
with
keystone
ice
you
wont
go
wrong
an
embarrasing
beer
with
no
promise
i
will
never
buy
a
30
pack
again
i
should
have
myself
commited
for
buying
one
as
it
is
for
5
09
for
a
twelve
pack
of
this
stuff
hell
you
cant
beat
that
im
a
college
student
and
that
price
is
comparable
to
natty
ice
and
to
be
honest
i
think
i
would
take
keystone
ice
over
natty
ice
just
about
any
day
probably
one
of
the
decent
tasting
cheap
beers
out
on
the
market
for
us
college
students
right
now
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
almost
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
weak
and
bitter
with
a
slight
malt
scent
the
taste
is
awful
it
is
watered
down
and
skunky
with
a
mildly
refreshing
finish
there
is
little
malt
flavor
here
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
too
much
carbonation
this
beer
is
good
i
guess
if
youre
low
on
funds
otherwise
id
stay
away
from
it
its
one
and
done
for
me
sinkability

i
was
going
to
dump
this
in
the
sink
except
i
was
concerned
about
causing
a
major
environmental
catastrophe
so
i
took
it
to
the
local
sanitary
land
fill
where
they
charged
me
extra
to
dispose
of
it
professionally
i
think
its
buried
about
three
or
four
feet
deeper
than
the
radioactive
cones
from
a
destroyed
nuclear
site
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellowishlight
straw
gold
with
a
foamy
brightwhite
head
that
drops
almost
immediately
to
just
a
collar
the
aroma
is
quite
limited
but
offers
some
dull
sweetish
malt
if
you
seek
it
out
the
body
is
light
with
a
fine
carbonation
thats
quite
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
limited
as
well
but
offers
a
clean
subtle
adjunctmalt
character
it
finishes
exceptionally
clean
and
drying
with
a
delicate
note
of
sugary
maltiness
that
lingers
shortly
in
the
aftertaste
theres
not
much
real
beer
flavor
here
in
fact
its
almost
like
a
beer
flavored
malternative
not
worth
trying
this
beer
doesnt
really
qualify
as
having
color
there
are
different
shades
of
transparent
including
the
head
and
that
clear
part
beneath
the
head
there
is
no
smell
other
than
the
container
there
is
very
little
taste
but
several
feelings
its
dry
crisp
and
unobtrusive
you
hardly
realize
youre
getting
full
and
hardly
realize
you
should
be
making
your
way
to
the
bathroom
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
this
stuff
is
still
better
than
natural
ice
ugh
and
is
probably
better
than
most
ice
beers
but
i
still
cant
recommend
this
stuff
get
it
if
youre
flat
broke
and
need
a
buzz
not
if
youre
on
a
budget
and
looking
for
a
halfway
decent
beer
some
say
this
beer
takes
them
back
to
fond
memories
of
college
and
high
school
drinking
days
i
only
hope
and
pray
that
i
never
find
myself
doing
the
same
thing
with
this
or
a
similiar
brew
this
beer
will
get
you
through
some
rough
times
when
you
have
a
taste
for
a
beer
and
you
either
dont
have
anything
else
in
the
basement
or
you
only
have
a
few
in
the
wallet
i
keep
a
few
around
for
an
emergency
if
you
poured
this
beer
in
a
glass
next
to
most
of
the
other
beers
in
its
class
you
could
not
see
the
difference
as
far
as
appearance
this
is
one
nasty
beer
pours
out
to
the
typical
average
golden
color
we
are
all
used
to
in
regards
to
beer
of
this
type
it
has
a
funky
grainy
taste
with
a
disgusting
sweetness
to
it
a
drain
pour
it
was
that
bad
even
at
99c
for
a
24oz
can
i
would
avoid
this
crap
a
complete
flop
almost
completely
undrinkable
dont
let
it
warm
up
at
all
i
hope
this
is
a
fad
that
goes
away
i
see
i
am
writing
the
first
review
for
this
beer
and
i
cant
say
i
am
surprised
i
have
never
seen
this
beer
anywhere
near
where
i
live
i
only
happened
upon
a
12pack
in
northern
new
hampshire
if
you
do
actually
drink
this
stuff
dont
expect
anything
different
from
any
other
american
ice
beer
it
is
strictly
for
messing
up
your
mind
and
tasting
like
crap
enjoy
very
good
commercial
owned
but
better
taste
and
value
over
third
shift
well
had
to
try
this
it
was
all
the
pub
had
that
i
hadnt
already
tried
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
fluffy
and
finebubbled
wheat
head
have
to
give
the
big
brews
credit
they
know
how
to
make
their
pseudocraft
brews
look
strongly
fruity
and
rather
sweet
aroma
has
a
malty
undertone
flavor
though
is
quite
good
malty
fruity
and
hoppy
rather
toothsome
body
is
about
average
though
there
is
decent
fizz
coors
youre
not
fooling
anybody
but
your
batch
19
is
at
least
superior
to
your
other
stuff
gotta
give
the
devil
his
due
228
bottle
decent
malt
smell
ok
but
not
a
very
strong
taste
or
feel
and
very
light
to
drink
i
prefer
stronger
beers
and
tastes
but
this
was
a
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
was
a
product
of
coors
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
sugars
to
keep
it
mild
and
not
too
sweet
nor
bitter
almost
a
wheaty
soapy
colored
head
that
dyed
quickly
i
wasnt
overall
fond
of
after
smelling
a
slight
nutty
aroma
from
the
brew
i
enjoyed
the
beer
with
some
slow
cooked
pulled
pork
and
it
coincided
with
the
dinner
just
fine
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
above
average
in
its
category
look
is
a
bit
darker
than
others
smell
is
average
and
taster
a
bit
above
liken
it
to
a
yuengling
which
is
a
good
thing
i
really
wanted
to
dislike
this
beer
but
it
is
surprisingly
good
it
pours
brilliant
gold
with
a
pure
white
1
foam
cap
with
masses
of
tiny
bubbles
that
produce
excellent
lace
has
a
clean
light
malt
spicy
herbal
nose
with
a
hint
of
earthiness
and
a
light
touch
of
grainy
spice
the
initial
palate
suggests
light
fruit
hints
of
apple
but
this
soon
hides
behind
rich
grain
and
light
malt
with
a
crisp
bitter
emphasis
on
the
finish
with
a
faint
lingering
hint
of
anise
from
the
hops
medium
light
body
and
above
average
carbonation
seltzery
but
surprisingly
drinkable
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
was
really
quite
good
not
too
bitter
no
bad
after
taste
smooth
and
flavorful
altogether
a
pretty
decent
lager
and
better
than
expected
p
s
get
this
where
you
can
build
your
own
six
pack
because
its
laughably
expensive
on
its
own
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
hoppy
enough
and
it
has
some
citrus
undertones
i
was
very
surprised
to
find
out
it
was
brewed
by
coors
i
will
be
being
this
one
again
dont
let
the
brewer
put
you
off
this
is
sneaky
good
not
a
bad
lager
overall
3
03
not
a
bad
lager
again
its
much
like
an
amber
and
if
you
like
fat
tire
youll
love
this
beer
as
in
my
opinion
it
is
slightly
better
coors
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
and
im
not
quite
sure
what
preprohibition
is
completely
about
but
its
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
flavor
is
there
and
in
spades
its
just
not
my
favorite
style
of
flavor
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
me
not
liking
a
beer
but
respecting
it
for
what
it
is
about
and
the
flavors
it
presents
this
aint
your
typical
aal
this
is
more
along
the
lines
of
a
copper
lager
or
a
harsh
amber
red
i
bought
it
because
of
the
name
and
it
seems
to
be
a
success
not
the
greatest
beer
but
its
tasty
enough
will
not
seek
out
or
purchase
again
wont
even
drink
it
if
offered
the
beer
is
hazy
and
light
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
light
khaki
head
the
aroma
is
adjunct
sweetness
sweet
caramel
malt
smells
macro
all
the
way
the
taste
is
just
shitty
theres
really
no
other
way
to
say
it
i
try
to
rate
to
style
and
i
dont
expect
an
adjunct
lager
to
have
the
complexity
of
a
gueze
or
big
imperial
stout
that
said
this
beer
tastes
like
syrup
artificial
sweeteners
fake
fruity
crap
there
is
no
integrity
in
this
product
this
beer
was
designed
for
commercial
purposes
only
gross
on
so
many
levels
avoid
coors
did
a
real
nice
job
with
this
brew
o
there
is
some
nice
soft
hops
flavor
but
it
is
to
dry
and
astringent
to
really
enjoy
and
no
malt
character
shows
up
overall
a
very
well
deserved
3
75
for
batch
19
i
wouldve
gave
it
a
solid
4
but
the
lack
of
scent
did
away
with
that
this
is
up
there
with
dortmunder
gold
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
will
definitely
buy
this
brew
again
overall
well
though
coors
tried
to
make
something
different
did
it
work
not
really
for
me
overall
very
nice
lager
well
balanced
between
bitter
and
sweet
pours
a
medium
amber
with
not
much
a
2finger
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
lots
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
different
sweet
hops
and
malts
taste
of
like
a
corn
sweetness
followed
up
by
gentle
hops
overall
very
enjoyable
if
this
is
what
some
beer
tasted
like
before
prohibition
in
1919
then
fire
up
the
ol
delorean
and
lets
take
a
trip
back
to
the
future
to
taste
some
more
earlytype
brews
great
job
coors
this
beer
really
surprised
me
and
since
then
ive
drank
a
ton
of
it
i
actually
buy
it
by
the
case
the
look
and
taste
are
both
good
but
what
got
me
the
most
was
the
smells
as
the
beer
warmed
you
can
literally
smell
the
strongest
floral
smells
i
think
ive
ever
smelled
in
a
beer
it
literally
starts
smelling
like
flowers
are
in
the
beer
the
taste
also
gets
more
complex
as
the
beer
warms
i
recommend
drinking
this
only
slightly
cold
or
take
it
out
of
the
fridge
and
let
it
set
for
10
mins
or
so
when
i
seen
coors
brewed
this
i
couldnt
believe
it
at
least
someone
over
there
knows
wtf
theyre
doing
haha
sure
isnt
the
brewer
coors
light
and
that
other
crap
beer
they
make
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
you
should
nothing
special
but
i
liked
it
the
bottle
itself
is
pretty
cool
looking
its
a
thirst
quencher
that
id
like
to
try
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
have
a
feeling
the
bottle
will
go
down
smoothly
and
relieve
that
yearning
for
something
cool
unsweetened
and
wet
to
give
that
get
up
and
go
kind
of
vitality
you
need
when
youre
say
mowing
the
lawn
nice
trying
the
batch
19
at
the
ugs
lounge
at
dulles
airport
the
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
copper
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
carries
bready
malt
with
hint
of
bittering
hops
the
taste
is
very
nice
and
smooth
there
is
a
definite
malt
which
provides
a
biscuit
punch
then
finishes
clean
with
slight
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbontation
overall
this
is
a
solid
lager
and
was
worth
the
try
and
the
bottle
is
pretty
unique
as
well
o
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
that
i
will
certainly
buy
again
one
more
comment
everybody
has
their
taste
preferences
im
originally
from
the
pacific
northwest
and
have
probably
tried
more
microbrews
than
most
people
think
exist
within
the
caveat
that
everybody
likes
something
most
microbrew
stuff
is
bilge
i
like
good
beer
whether
its
a
global
brand
or
one
cooked
up
in
the
neighbors
garage
if
youre
in
the
camp
that
says
the
big
brewers
cant
possibly
make
great
beer
well
as
the
saying
goes
no
man
is
as
blind
as
one
who
refuses
to
see
or
taste
in
this
case
the
big
brewers
werent
always
big
which
is
still
irrelevant
but
prior
to
prohibition
they
all
had
great
recipes
every
once
in
a
while
they
bringem
back
and
batch
19
is
one
of
them
ab
has
done
it
in
the
past
as
well
so
if
youre
openminded
not
quite
ready
for
an
ipa
but
like
a
complex
hoppy
flavored
lager
that
will
go
great
on
a
hot
or
cold
day
give
this
a
shot
price
9
99
for
6pack
coors
batch
19
is
the
american
macrobrewerys
attempt
to
cash
in
on
the
recent
explosion
of
craft
brewing
in
the
us
i
purchased
this
bottle
expecting
not
to
like
it
what
a
surprise
no
what
a
shock
for
the
first
time
im
nostalgic
for
the
19th
century
and
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
these
preprohibition
beers
which
have
been
increasingly
visible
on
the
craft
beer
scene
of
late
overall
this
is
well
brewed
beer
the
lightly
roasted
malt
flavor
is
accented
with
well
balanced
hopped
finished
a
good
fairly
light
bodied
beer
with
decent
flavor
great
on
hot
day
hats
off
to
coors
for
this
one
o
an
all
malt
lager
with
a
balance
of
enjoyable
hop
character
a
good
example
of
a
style
i
really
get
to
enjoy
outside
of
home
brewing
circles
i
have
to
say
for
the
style
this
beer
was
much
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
definitely
a
good
alternative
to
the
bud
miller
lite
etc
fairly
drinkable
beer
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
thick
creamcolored
medium
size
head
that
settles
after
a
bit
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
few
slow
bubble
trails
aroma
is
a
tad
perfumey
malt
grass
flavors
like
nose
tang
and
mild
sweetness
up
front
bitter
in
back
not
too
complex
but
drinkable
bodycarbonation
decent
finish
is
like
flavor
on
the
short
side
over
all
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
if
i
wanted
to
drink
a
lighter
beer
id
consider
having
one
or
two
in
a
bar
try
this
to
bad
they
have
the
money
and
market
to
make
a
real
good
beer
this
is
not
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
i
really
love
this
stuff
this
and
third
shift
are
now
my
prime
lagers
ill
be
buying
another
sixer
in
the
future
my
favorite
beer
to
date
im
a
history
guy
so
when
i
saw
a
preprohibition
style
lager
i
had
to
get
it
could
not
be
happier
with
the
decision
good
color
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
smell
because
i
didnt
realize
that
the
first
batch
i
picked
up
was
way
past
the
suggested
date
it
still
tasted
great
though
then
had
to
buy
a
new
batch
not
past
the
date
and
it
was
even
better
cant
believe
its
made
by
coors
thanks
a
lot
prohibition
for
making
this
delicious
beer
disappear
for
almost
a
century
a
pleasant
surprise
i
had
no
idea
coors
was
capable
of
such
a
product
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
everyone
should
go
into
this
one
with
an
open
mind
and
prepare
to
be
blown
away
because
its
not
just
a
good
beer
for
a
domestic
brewery
its
just
a
good
beer
period
o
this
beer
is
a
lot
fuller
bodied
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
and
doesnt
have
any
adjunctlike
flavors
overall
i
really
like
coors
batch
19
if
beer
in
1919
was
really
as
tasty
as
that
i
can
see
why
prohibition
was
in
force
coors
has
made
a
solid
beer
here
if
they
can
manage
to
avoid
marking
it
up
to
craft
beer
prices
they
could
find
themselves
with
a
new
hit
just
a
few
bucks
more
than
a
12pack
of
the
banquet
would
be
perfect
the
fancy
bottles
are
nice
too
shame
they
arent
pryoff
o
overall
i
think
it
is
drinkable
it
is
an
interesting
departure
from
their
regular
beers
that
just
so
happens
to
taste
a
lot
like
all
their
other
beers
albeit
slightly
better
batch
19
preprohibition
style
lager
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
in
the
aroma
and
sweet
maltiness
also
is
noticeable
fairly
good
flavor
guess
i
wasnt
expecting
that
that
starts
with
a
sweet
malt
flavor
and
then
some
spicy
hops
make
themselves
noticeable
much
better
than
a
typical
macro
american
adjunct
lager
the
bottle
says
it
is
inspired
by
a
preprohibition
recipe
nmf
malts
hops
flavor
i
am
used
to
macro
lagers
being
wimpy
fizzy
beers
but
this
was
a
notable
exception
coors
really
came
through
big
time
with
this
preprohibition
style
lager
i
would
love
to
see
it
offered
in
tall
ball
cans
perhaps
taking
a
space
alongside
pbr
narragansett
and
schlitz
at
my
local
digs
im
wanting
to
compare
this
to
other
retrobrews

this
beer
was
much
better
than
i
expected
to
the
untrained
palate
this
might
almost
seem
like
a
weaker
american
pale
ale
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
my
advice
would
be
not
to
overlook
this
option

really
not
bad
for
cheap
beer
about
par
for
the
course
this
isnt
the
worst
american
adjunct
lager
ive
had
but
theres
not
much
to
stand
out
here
all
in
all
id
rather
have
an
oly
if
drinking
this
style
ahhhh
the
memories
of
days
gone
by
when
anything
was
glorious
so
long
was
it
ethyl
alcohol
but
really
you
could
do
worse
all
things
considered
hamms
is
a
great
value
adjunct
lager
coming
in
at
13
99
for
a
30
rack
its
a
great
working
mans
beer
c
overall
it
is
an
average
player
in
the
lowest
category
drinkable
on
a
budget
but
not
enjoyable
i
remember
it
as
being
pale
yellow
fizzy
and
bland
of
course
back
when
i
drank
swill
like
this
i
wasnt
going
for
taste
great
aal
good
with
any
food
an
ok
swill
beer
nothing
remarkable
either
good
or
bad
certainly
better
than
other
stuff
that
comes
out
of
milwaukee
it
was
what
it
was
this
beer
is
fine
for
an
all
day
beer
drinking
marathon
nothing
special
about
it
other
than
the
memories
you
create
while
drinking
it
o
not
bad
makes
for
a
good
lawn
mower
beer
holds
its
own
for
sure
against
more
highly
priced
offerings
in
the
style
the
old
school
can
is
really
cool
as
well
ok
its
charming
to
drink
hams
and
it
doesnt
taste
as
bad
as
a
few
others
but
being
from
minnesota
means
you
have
to
like
hamms
beer
not
liking
would
be
like
picking
a
lady
slipper
or
dissing
bud
grant
we
frown
on
things
like
that
this
is
really
the
perfect
beer
for
drinking
in
a
smoky
room
with
sticky
floors
late
at
night
after
you
may
have
overimbibed
the
sweet
corn
is
understated
considering
the
style
and
it
still
has
a
discernible
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
to
accompany
bonus
its
union
made
not
to
big
of
a
fan
of
hamms
my
parents
sell
it
for
1
a
can
at
there
bar
ive
had
a
few
but
really
just
dont
like
it
i
generally
only
order
this
when
a
group
of
us
are
sharing
rounds
on
the
cheap
an
elderly
friend
of
mine
gave
me
one
of
these
in
a
gesture
of
kindness
i
took
one
sip
and
poured
the
rest
down
his
kitchen
sink
when
he
wasnt
looking
maybe
it
was
skunky
but
damn
i
couldnt
stomach
it
appearance
has
a
yellow
and
gold
look
with
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
hams
smells
like
your
typical
american
adjunct
lager
grainy
and
cook
vegetables
taste
is
grainy
and
smooth
it
is
very
easy
drinking
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
watery
overall
hams
i
the
top
tasting
cheap
american
lagers
on
market
and
cam
compete
with
other
lagers
wich
are
priced
higher
i
believe
this
is
the
best
cheap
beer
out
there
at
12
19
a
thirty
its
an
unbelievable
value
for
me
way
above
stag
pbr
or
milwaukees
best
witch
i
tend
to
consume
in
high
volume
its
no
craft
beer
by
any
means
but
for
a
classic
american
beer
this
is
a
home
run
for
me
pours
a
pale
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
down
to
just
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
lots
of
small
streaming
bubbles
are
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
good
carbonation
some
very
light
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
grassgrains
with
a
hint
of
floral
and
hay
even
the
taste
is
pretty
close
to
the
aroma
with
some
corn
sweetness
in
the
mix
as
well
a
little
lightbodied
but
decent
goes
down
easy
and
is
really
cent
for
the
price
as
you
can
buy
a
30pack
for
14
98
or
a
6
of
tall
boys
for
just
4
98
overall
not
a
bad
brew
drink
some
and
enjoy
i
have
this
in
my
beer
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
its
my
work
in
the
yard
and
lawn
mower
beer
when
you
dont
want
a
craft
beer
and
its
not
the
place
or
time
for
one
its
an
easy
drinking
adjunct
american
lager
retro
beer
when
you
drink
it
you
have
visions
of
a
simpler
time
in
america
its
fun
to
take
a
30
pack
to
family
who
cant
get
it
and
view
their
amazement
its
still
around
if
you
havent
tried
it
give
it
a
try
remember
its
not
a
craft
but
an
a
american
original
think
hamms
bear
overall
this
is
a
pretty
standard
adjunct
lager
its
boring
but
inoffensive
i
got
it
out
of
a
1
grab
bag
at
a
local
liquor
store
but
otherwise
wouldnt
buy
another
one
id
recommend
this
to
a
buddy
tight
on
cash
this
is
the
new
session
beer
in
my
household
judge
all
you
want
this
is
the
beer
that
is
both
good
and
bad
so
moderate
consumption
is
required
overall
solid
especially
for
the
whole
1
i
paid
for
the
24
oz
can
not
a
thing
wrong
with
it
just
not
really
craft
beer
but
a
solid
adjunct
lager
from
a
can
hamms
25
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
real
its
not
expensive
it
taste
like
a
beer
should
taste
ive
tried
a
great
deal
of
different
types
of
beer
some
go
way
overboard
and
add
funky
flavors
or
way
too
much
hops
but
getting
back
to
basics
this
to
me
is
an
almost
perfect
beer
now
some
of
you
like
the
girly
flavored
beers
and
thats
ok
but
thats
not
real
beer
this
is
also
just
so
you
know
i
do
like
other
beers
such
as
stella
guinness
stout
boulevard
but
not
the
ipa
dos
equis
and
many
others
im
not
a
beer
snob
but
when
i
like
a
beer
that
is
good
regardless
of
price
ill
be
as
honest
as
i
can
going
with
my
taste
preferences
overall
this
is
a
classic
lawnmower
beer
the
adjunct
lager
is
inexpensive
but
satisfies
on
a
basic
level
hamms
is
better
than
most
beers
of
this
style
so
if
you
are
on
a
budget
this
is
a
good
choice
overall
a
previous
reviewer
said
it
best
hamms
is
nothing
more
than
a
thirst
quenching
lawnmower
beer
as
all
beer
should
be
although
a
bit
watery
finishes
clean
for
an
inexpensive
beer
wheres
my
mower
overall
hamms
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
kinda
gross
but
drinkable
i
stacked
three
macro
lagers
next
to
each
other
busch
high
life
and
hamms
hamms
was
by
far
the
worst
of
the
three
for
1230
pack
its
a
great
value
but
dont
expect
greatness
hamms
is
like
a
cornbread
tininfested
coors
banquet
flavor
not
a
lot
going
on
here
mostly
corn
sweetness
with
a
slight
malt
flavor
maybe
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
nearly
a
drain
pour
for
me
overall
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
thirst
quenching
lawnmower
beer
but
it
does
an
excellent
job
of
being
just
that
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
for
the
price
it
is
hard
to
beat
me
likes
hamms
and
will
always
cause
the
stuff
just
tastes
good
galldarnit
thanx
hamms
at
10
9930
pack
its
definitely
best
beer
for
your
money
i
live
around
a
lot
of
beer
snobs
who
only
drink
micros
but
i
honestly
think
this
tastes
better
real
smooth
taste
either
ice
cold
or
warm
not
too
much
of
a
head
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
perfect
beer
smell
that
brings
back
memories
of
old
of
my
old
man
n
his
friends
playing
horseshoes
perfect
beer
for
those
people
who
wanna
drink
a
beer
while
hanging
out
in
garage
with
neighbors
or
playing
horseshoes
with
neighbors
isnt
that
what
drinking
beer
is
supposed
to
be
about
top
grade
homeowners
beer
can
drink
a
quality
beer
and
still
afford
your
mortgage
would
i
buy
it
again
mostly
just
for
camping
overall
pretty
standard
average
adjunct
lager
seen
it
a
bunch
of
times
so
i
gave
it
a
whirl
tall
boy
can
six
pack
for
4
00
pours
straw
yellow
a
shade
darker
than
the
average
american
adjunct
lager
foamy
white
head
lingers
for
a
bit
then
stays
as
a
thin
wispy
lace
on
top
of
the
beer
aromas
is
faint
hops
and
cornbread
again
a
bit
above
average
for
the
style
taste
bready
with
a
corn
tinge
hops
are
definitely
apparent
but
very
light
very
clean
flavor
profile
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
just
a
touch
better
than
many
of
its
more
famous
competitors
given
that
this
is
one
of
the
cheapest
beers
out
there
it
is
not
bad
for
what
it
is
would
choose
over
coors
bud
or
pabst
o
its
an
alright
cheap
aal
beer
on
a
budget
check
it
out
nothing
special
but
better
than
light
beer
this
is
cheap
beer
and
below
average
for
that
in
my
opinion
not
enjoyable
though
i
was
able
to
chug
the
second
half
and
move
on
hamms
is
made
for
drinking
of
all
the
american
lagers
out
there
this
and
schlitz
tussle
for
king
of
the
mountain
if
you
noticed
in
my
review
i
mentioned
how
clean
and
grainy
this
beer
is
just
as
i
think
it
should
be
for
what
this
beer
is
its
respectable
overall
hamms
no
additional
comments
needed
o
its
hamms
for
damn
sake
i
wasnt
expecting
much
when
i
bought
this
beer
but
i
was
going
for
cheapness
its
15
99
for
a
30
pack
and
it
tastes
just
as
good
as
any
other
aal
cheers
tonight
after
bowling
league
i
picked
up
12
cans
of
hamms
beer
for
around
6
99
i
like
to
revisit
the
old
industrial
lagers
from
time
to
time
im
on
number
three
and
i
have
to
say
im
digging
this
beer
looks
like
an
old
time
lager
should
very
clear
and
very
pale
aroma
sort
of
leaps
out
you
for
an
adjunct
lager
that
is
first
of
all
it
doesnt
smell
like
corn
thats
something
right
there
second
i
can
smell
hops
honest
to
goodness
hops
not
like
really
powerful
hops
but
they
are
there
in
all
their
floral
grassy
ahem
glory
tastes
alright
again
doesnt
taste
like
corn
its
not
an
overly
sweet
corn
flavored
beer
its
light
and
wheaty
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
off
dry
finish
nice
full
carbed
up
mouth
this
beer
is
solid
and
mostly
stands
out
for
what
it
doesnt
have
that
is
its
lack
of
sweet
corny
flavour
clean
and
basic
with
a
touch
of
hops
hamms
the
beer
refreshing
great
with
a
shot
of
brandy
pizza
steak
or
any
american
fare
have
a
beer
have
a
hamms
o
ordered
this
for
fun
honestly
i
wasnt
expecting
more
than
i
received
id
rather
have
a
bud
i
would
like
to
see
how
it
drinks
out
of
the
can
sourcing
purchased
at
specs
in
texas
for
4
79
for
a
sixpack
of
sixteenounce
cans
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
i
pick
this
up
cause
i
wanted
something
cheap
to
bring
to
a
party
of
nonbeer
drinkers
plus
i
heard
it
was
the
new
hipster
beer
and
wanted
to
check
it
out
not
as
good
as
pbr
or
bud
and
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
overall
a
pretty
surprisingly
good
adjunct
lager
probably
the
perfect
lawnmower
beer
of
the
many
adjunct
lagers
that
i
have
tried
lately
hamms
ranks
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
at
around
6
a
sixpack
you
simply
cannot
find
a
better
deal
overall
truly
not
a
terrible
option
for
a
cheap
easily
drinkable
beer
for
social
events
where
drinking
for
taste
is
not
the
primary
goal
this
would
be
a
good
option
for
college
parties
tailgates
and
other
social
events
where
you
want
an
unassertive
crowd
pleaser
that
is
a
step
up
from
icecold
light
lagers
hamms
was
once
a
great
name
in
its
day
the
brand
was
practically
synonymous
with
beer
in
certain
parts
of
the
upper
midwest
my
earliest
memories
are
of
it
on
draft
at
a
certain
3
2
joint
in
minnesota
in
the
70s
it
had
a
reputation
as
a
shitty
beer
by
then
but
it
always
had
its
devotees
too
i
think
its
a
fine
beer
for
the
price
3
99
for
a
six
pack
of
pounders
at
my
local
cstore
not
a
beer
suitable
for
a
full
analysis
but
not
a
beer
that
is
asking
for
one
anyway
for
a
cheap
session
beer
this
one
is
nearunbeatable
nothing
about
it
is
repelling
and
the
taste
straight
wheat
is
actually
decent
if
unremarkable
just
as
palatable
as
any
other
adjunct
lager
and
wayyy
cheaper
plus
the
boxs
and
cans
artwork
if
you
can
call
it
that
is
classic
o
just
a
real
good
and
cheap
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
i
just
dont
know
where
u
would
find
this
i
havent
heard
of
this
until
a
few
weeks
ago
u
will
probably
never
find
something
that
tastes
like
this
httpwww
youtube
comwatchvdb9za4emrr4
o
well
as
to
be
expected
there
isnt
much
going
on
with
this
one
sadly
there
are
better
light
lagers
available
o
i
just
may
have
found
a
new
goto
cheap
beer
for
buying
en
masse
if
your
looking
for
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
great
taste
and
unbeatable
cost
then
hamms
is
your
beer
they
have
stayed
true
to
their
labeling
as
well
as
their
flavor
for
years
i
do
like
some
micros
and
i
absolutely
love
guinness
but
i
hate
that
folks
are
so
proud
of
them
i
can
by
30
hamms
or
less
then
12
case
of
a
micro
ill
take
hamms
thank
you
very
much
i
dont
care
about
grassy
this
or
that
the
only
question
for
is
whether
it
tastes
great
and
it
does
the
flavor
is
distinctive
balanced
and
enjoyable
again
as
long
as
its
fresh
youll
get
a
really
crisp
slightly
graindominated
start
which
develops
into
a
fresh
yeastier
finish
delightful
hops
are
present
in
a
correct
ratio
this
isnt
some
insanely
overhopped
liquid
black
dirt
microbrew
medium
to
lighter
bodied
its
just
the
thing
for
the
summer
it
doesnt
weigh
you
down
but
its
immensely
satisfying
update

okay
fine
hamms
has
been
our
house
cheepniss
all
summer
long
probably
on
our
12th
or
13th
case
at
this
point
and
its
always
in
the
fridge
now
for
handing
out
by
the
armload
to
a
bunch
of
guests
for
keeping
the
whistle
whetted
in
between
precious
glasses
of
hidolla
craft
for
pouring
on
the
flareups
when
grilling
burgers
and
for
soaking
the
grilled
brats
until
serving
time
basically
for
all
general
hey
its
beer
drinking
purposes
one
time
i
tried
dry
hopping
a
can
i
was
drinking
with
some
cascade
pellet
yeah
dont
do
that
take
it
for
what
it
is
and
it
wont
disappoint
much
expect
anything
more
and
youre
dumb
hamms
has
a
light
golden
color
lightly
carbonated
and
drinks
smoothly
hamms
is
very
similar
to
miller
high
life
grain
belt
premium
in
terms
of
appearance
and
smell
however
hamms
has
a
distinct
hop
flavor
that
makes
for
a
more
enjoyable
drinking
experience
hamms
is
a
no
nonsense
blue
collar
beer
that
satisfies
again
and
again
cheers
i
know
this
site
is
full
of
elitists
and
beer
snobs
but
hamms
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
session
beer
available
ever
great
taste
and
great
value
get
off
your
high
horse
and
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
because
hamms
is
truly
deserving
i
just
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
in
new
england
overall
this
is
an
adjunct
lager
and
i
cant
say
it
is
a
great
beer
it
serves
its
purpose
as
a
refreshing
lawnmower
companion
and
makes
my
relatives
feel
welcome
in
my
home
my
rating
for
this
beer
is
strictly
style
based
receiving
an
elevated
score
because
of
price
15
bucks
for
a
thirty
pack
its
not
my
favorite
adjunct
but
it
is
the
cheapest
one
i
am
willing
to
drink
and
beats
bmc
seven
days
a
week
milwaukees
best
used
to
be
the
cheapest
30pack
on
the
market
but
now
hamms
has
the
cheapest
30pack
in
town
a
30pack
of
hamms
is
under
12
before
tax
and
bottle
deposit
and
the
taste
is
decent
id
say
its
very
similar
to
red
dog
busch
and
milwaukees
best
sweet
grain
a
little
grassy
crisp
bitterness
just
a
touch
of
corn
slight
dry
finish
light
and
watery
very
crisp
well
carbonated
note
i
review
for
the
style
i
refuse
to
let
my
prejudices
slant
any
review
nothing
worse
than
the
typical
beer
snob
reviewing
an
aal
same
for
your
aal
drinker
reviewing
a
craft
brew
overall
not
something
i
would
seek
out
might
pick
this
up
since
its
around
15
bucks
for
a
30
pack
this
pours
a
foamy
pee
colorlight
yellow
with
lazy
bubbles
theres
a
light
corn
malt
aroma
with
the
classic
smell
of
adjuncts
its
not
offensive
but
not
terribly
appealing
either
the
flavor
starts
off
about
as
crisp
and
clean
and
its
going
to
getkeep
it
coldand
rapidly
falls
off
with
a
harsh
musty
finish
about
everything
i
expected
from
this
one
many
people
i
have
encountered
are
hating
on
the
hamms
i
have
to
say
for
what
it
is
it
is
good
i
like
the
fact
that
i
have
the
ability
to
enjoy
high
end
craft
beers
homebrew
and
hamms
all
beer
styles
have
that
one
beer
that
is
the
platonic
ideal
and
as
far
as
american
lagers
go
hamms
is
the
one
for
me
not
as
sweet
as
pbr
and
lighter
feeling
than
stag
hamms
is
a
go
to
beer
when
you
want
to
drink
up
american
history
an
american
classic
born
in
the
land
of
sky
blue
waters
nice
job
hamms
hamms
is
typical
american
adjunct
lager
reminiscent
of
coors
banquet
in
its
sweet
yet
subtle
flavor
light
watery
and
very
drinkable
no
off
flavors
or
smells
but
after
a
few
i
could
sense
a
coating
of
tongue
bum
breath
settling
in
i
think
hamms
holds
its
own
esp
since
normally
it
is
about
cheaper
than
anything
else
around
but
has
a
solid
drinkability
still
prefer
ballantine
banquet
or
schlitz
as
my
go
to
adjuncts
but
hamms
is
certainly
a
very
good
choice
when
on
a
budget
very
easy
drinking
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
a
bit
of
strong
on
the
adjuncts
i
suppose
it
hits
style
fairly
well
can
do
for
a
lawnmower
beer
if
you
enjoy
drinking
it
because
of
the
cool
classic
commericals
then
go
for
it
otherwise
pbr
is
a
superior
alternative
decent
amount
of
taste
albeit
cooked
grain
adjunct
taste
that
being
said
if
you
drink
this
excessively
plan
on
waking
up
with
a
massive
headache
i
consider
this
a
dirty
beer
unionmade
but
dirty
if
i
could
rate
this
lower
i
would
by
far
the
worst
beer
ive
had
the
taste
is
the
equivalent
to
a
in
heat
wheat
by
flying
dog
head
i
just
get
hit
with
wheat
and
awfulness
just
a
bad
beer
again
if
i
could
rate
this
lower
i
would
its
just
that
awful
in
conmparison
to
the
more
mainstream
lagers
hamms
looks
pretty
good
better
and
cheaper
a
double
win
just
dont
confuse
this
with
a
sam
adams
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
cost
is
appropriate
and
of
course
expected
results
are
met
i
mean
really
this
is
a
simple
beer
clean
of
any
technical
flaws
for
sure
just
not
memorable
great
for
summer
sun
rehydration
or
kayaking
trips
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
i
dont
know
if
it
is
the
hot
weather
or
lack
of
having
a
beer
for
awhile
but
i
found
this
one
to
go
down
fairly
easy
considering
the
style
with
the
assortment
of
other
mass
produced
products
in
this
classification
you
could
do
worse
if
given
the
option
of
nothing
but
bmc
products
i
would
probably
choose
this
one
over
them
literally
the
very
edge
of
the
cheap
corner
of
a
beer
shelf
hamms
brings
virtually
nothing
to
the
table
in
terms
of
anything
a
transparent
piss
yellow
color
with
your
average
lager
smell
taste
was
slightly
less
appealing
than
bud
light
and
the
mouthfeel
was
all
fizzy
and
carbonation
but
at
13
45
a
30
pack
you
cant
really
pass
it
up
if
you
want
to
get
a
few
people
drunk
for
very
cheap
although
id
shell
out
a
little
bit
extra
for
some
milwaukees
or
some
pabst
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
washed
this
beer
down
with
a
pabst
after
some
research
i
guess
this
is
a
millercoors
product
my
bad
and
i
do
love
the
generic
looking
retro
can
i
have
always
loved
those
o
it
has
a
little
more
taste
than
others
in
this
category
i
appreciate
the
history
of
this
beer
as
well
as
other
rust
belt
beers
so
im
kind
of
partial
to
it
from
the
can
stamped
sep1012co8031534
sampled
on
june
1
2012
it
pours
a
highly
carbonated
pale
yellow
with
a
head
that
rises
about
an
inch
and
eventually
settles
down
i
am
rating
this
on
whether
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
and
american
adjunct
should
the
look
is
right
the
aroma
is
of
grains
corn
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
creamy
the
taste
is
also
grainy
corny
but
the
hops
finish
it
surprisingly
crisp
and
clean
i
stumbled
across
this
in
a
beverage
store
in
southern
new
hampshire
and
i
have
not
seen
hamms
in
new
hampshire
since
the
1980s
easily
worth
the
3
75
i
paid
for
the
6pack
not
sure
who
brews
hamms
any
more
the
last
time
i
had
any
was
about
36
years
ago
at
the
oly
brewery
tour
but
one
of
our
local
stores
had
a
30case
for
17
so
i
thought
it
was
time
to
sock
some
away
for
casual
summer
sipping
then
i
broke
out
one
and
stuck
it
in
the
freezer
for
a
half
hour
and
then
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
i
dont
like
the
aluminum
smell
drinking
from
a
can
the
smell
wasnt
like
a
brewery
but
just
a
pleasant
nonspecific
fragrance
the
head
starts
off
ok
and
drops
off
to
near
nothing
after
a
couple
of
minutes
the
color
is
standard
for
american
beer
the
taste
is
pretty
much
bitter
malt
with
a
slightly
sweet
touch
and
the
flavor
fades
away
pleasantly
i
think
that
if
you
keep
this
beer
cool
you
could
continue
drinking
cans
of
it
all
day
half
a
can
provides
a
pleasant
buzz
and
this
beer
will
make
a
sunny
day
very
enjoyable
barely
drinkable
asis
ill
know
for
sure
if
i
wake
up
in
the
morning
with
a
wicked
headache
light
body
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
is
bad
my
friend
bought
this
and
i
want
him
to
get
his
money
back
all
five
dollars
for
the
six
pack
of
tall
boys
im
pretty
sure
if
there
was
a
purgatory
for
yeast
this
would
be
it
not
heaven
not
hell
but
somewhere
vaguely
inbetween
overall
im
honestly
impressed
by
how
bad
this
beer
isnt
lol
in
my
area
busch
is
the
cheapest
beer
you
can
buy
they
just
started
selling
this
stuff
and
its
about
a
dollar
cheaper
o
well
its
9
99
where
i
live
and
you
really
get
what
you
pay
for
33
apiece
beer
looks
good
for
what
is
in
a
glass
but
if
you
make
it
past
4
your
a
champ
for
having
put
that
much
crap
in
your
mouth
overall
for
as
cheap
as
this
beer
is
its
actually
just
as
good
as
any
other
massproduced
adjunct
lager
in
the
bmc
crowd
it
goes
down
very
smooth
has
very
low
abv
and
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
my
review
is
based
on
other
american
adjunct
lagers
i
rate
according
to
style
bottom
line
it
is
what
it
is
a
cheap
beer
for
people
on
a
budget
that
is
no
worse
than
any
of
the
bigger
names
with
lots
of
advertising
money
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
for
the
advocates
but
more
for
college
kids
trying
to
get
drunk
like
me
its
no
schlitz
but
at
12
99
a
30
pack
this
is
currently
the
most
bang
for
the
buck
in
town
anyway
if
you
drink
a
hamms
then
listen
to
some
george
jones
nothing
else
will
really
do
taste
is
crisp
and
again
non
offensive
light
with
prickly
carbonation
i
like
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
from
the
land
of
sky
blue
waters
the
taste
seems
very
separated
first
the
bitterness
with
the
carbonation
then
a
watery
lack
of
flavour
and
then
the
light
flavour
of
the
malt
that
carries
that
classic
bad
beer
taste
im
looking
for
it
doesnt
meld
together
well
due
to
the
high
carbonation
i
believe
this
kinda
sucks
but
kinda
makes
it
interesting
id
still
prefer
lower
carbonation
though
im
probably
not
going
to
buy
this
beer
again
since
schlitz
gusto
is
in
the
same
price
range
and
a
better
beer
but
if
schlitz
ends
up
costing
more
i
might
think
about
buying
hamms
again
its
better
than
the
big
names
marginally
certainly
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
taken
for
what
it
is
cheap
at
9
9924
cans
this
mops
the
floor
with
the
big
boys
lagers
providing
some
taste
for
the
buck
o
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
for
the
price
probably
about
on
par
with
pbr
definitely
preferable
to
the
big
macros
overall
its
quite
average
but
would
certainly
do
when
youre
fishin
and
someone
else
is
buying
the
beer
thanks
to
cpolking
for
providing
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
corn
and
grains
taste
is
mild
some
grains
just
a
touch
of
hops
nothing
offensive
but
not
exactly
flavorful
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
overall
what
a
great
brew
from
wisconsin
awesome
adjunct
and
cant
believe
i
havent
seen
this
sooner
havent
bought
a
pack
of
beer
over
6
in
more
than
months
always
cool
seeing
new
beer
on
the
gas
station
scene
prost
notes
too
sweet
lacking
in
hops
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
utica
club
i
think
i
am
over
my
nostalgia
for
this
beer
come
on
miller
coors
bring
it
back
to
pa
was
a
real
big
seller
in
the
old
days
here
and
i
think
the
way
retro
beers
are
selling
around
here
in
pa
would
sell
great
again
a
typical
old
time
real
working
mans
american
beer
drinking
it
i
could
imagin
the
hamms
beer
bear
dancing
in
the
old
time
ads
from
the
land
of
sky
blue
waters
hamms
the
beer
refreshing
update
hamms
is
back
in
pa
in
2012
just
bought
a
30
pack
at
epps
in
limerick
this
will
be
my
hot
weather
drink
a
bunch
beer
from
now
on
thanks
to
miller
coors
for
bringing
it
back
hamms
is
very
old
school
in
falvor
and
refreshment
for
its
type
o
a
decent
beer
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
was
a
poor
move
but
otherwise
its
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
out
there
rjt
da
drinkable
and
fairly
decent
version
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
o
sure
its
not
the
best
lager
out
there
but
on
a
hot
day
with
burgers
on
the
grill
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
for
the
price
and
taste
it
beats
the
the
other
macros
i
can
remember
the
tv
adds
for
this
beer
back
in
the
70s
one
of
my
northern
trucker
buddies
brought
be
a
six
of
this
since
i
havent
seen
any
since
the
mid
70s
brings
back
memories
very
impressive
head
three
fingers
of
dense
foam
with
much
lace
and
cling
clear
with
lots
of
micro
bubbles
a
4
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
the
smell
brings
be
back
to
days
of
camping
in
michigan
aromas
of
cereal
grains
a
slight
floral
array
and
a
wisp
of
lime
taste
is
not
quite
what
i
remember
from
the
70s
but
it
is
not
bad
lime
in
the
fringes
wheat
oats
and
malt
in
the
forefront
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
helped
by
the
massive
carbonation
great
for
old
time
sake
brings
back
lots
of
good
memories
when
i
taste
a
mouthful
continuing
with
the
throw
backs
that
have
seemed
to
make
its
way
into
main
stream
i
tried
a
hamms
it
is
like
pabsts
brother
the
color
is
golden
clear
with
decent
carbonation
the
smell
and
taste
are
grainy
like
you
would
expect
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
pours
a
huge
head
i
mean
huge
three
fingers
its
lasting
longer
than
i
thought
it
would
but
im
sure
it
will
be
gone
in
no
time
the
body
is
completely
see
through
damn
this
is
see
through
this
might
be
the
most
see
through
beer
yet
and
thats
saying
a
lot
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
surprisingly
the
beer
looks
like
it
is
leaving
good
lacing
im
in
awe
even
though
i
can
here
the
head
fizzing
away
the
appearance
actually
isnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
mean
the
body
is
atrocious
but
the
head
has
some
good
qualities
unlike
coors
and
coors
light
you
can
smell
a
little
hops
on
the
nose
very
very
small
but
still
there
other
than
that
there
is
a
malt
sweetness
and
a
sour
adjunct
smell
not
horrible
again
on
the
smell
but
for
sure
not
up
to
par
with
any
good
beer
the
taste
is
pretty
crappy
there
is
mostly
just
sweet
almost
stale
malt
taste
here
there
is
the
smallest
hop
taste
but
nothing
really
there
very
watery
i
mostly
just
get
that
gross
cheap
malt
taste
on
one
hand
it
has
more
of
a
flavor
than
coors
and
coors
light
but
its
not
a
good
flavor
mouthfeel
is
pretty
bad
but
not
as
bad
as
the
coors
light
it
has
some
girth
to
it
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
just
watery
the
drinkability
is
the
one
great
thing
about
this
beer
it
just
goes
down
like
no
other
it
is
super
light
and
now
that
i
drink
it
more
that
flavor
that
i
thought
it
had
has
kinda
gone
and
its
all
subdued
so
i
makes
it
easier
to
drink
overall
on
this
beer
eh
ok
for
an
adjunct
lager
the
beer
changes
a
lot
as
you
drink
it
gross
in
some
ways
smooth
in
some
other
ways
flavor
is
weak
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
to
give
a
baby
bite
to
the
flavor
of
this
beer
more
flavor
than
light
beers
that
are
glorified
mineral
water
but
not
too
much
to
think
about
here
either
carbonated
throughout
light
and
kind
of
refreshing
although
some
flavor
and
boldness
could
do
a
little
good
here
d
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
as
a
whole
but
this
is
far
better
than
bud
bud
light
corona
miller
lite
and
their
cohorts
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
fast
just
a
light
easy
drinking
beer
a
good
one
to
pick
up
in
the
warmer
weather
of
spring
and
summer
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
cheap
and
youre
tired
of
pabst
it
tastes
like
a
full
beer
not
any
of
the
light
beers
have
a
full
body
i
think
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
it
was
on
tap
and
not
from
a
can
it
is
quite
hoppy
and
has
lots
of
bitterness
to
it
followed
by
a
small
sweet
spot
right
at
the
end
the
body
was
a
smidge
fuller
than
usual
drinkability
was
about
what
i
expected
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
you
could
do
better
and
worse
than
this
d
very
disappointed
but
not
surpirsed
for
my
favorite
macro
i
drink
this
beer
with
pride
you
cant
find
garbage
like
this
anywhere
i
actually
found
a
dive
bar
that
served
this
and
enjoyed
every
second
of
it
pass
me
another
good
for
when
you
want
to
get
wasted
and
get
caught
up
with
old
friends
can
into
a
pint
glass
not
much
here
piss
yellow
no
real
body
flavor
or
aroma
pretty
much
what
i
expected
at
least
it
was
cheap
at
2
99
a
six
pack
even
in
downtown
chicago
being
originally
from
wisconsin
i
did
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
high
school
cheap
stuff
better
than
a
lot
of
adjuncts
but
still
not
real
beer
in
my
opinion
goes
down
super
easy
like
water
which
it
pretty
much
is
buy
it
if
youre
up
against
coors
or
one
of
the
others
but
otherwise
take
a
pass
taste
same
cooked
vegetal
corn
feel
for
it
but
lots
of
carbonation
even
detectable
hops
extremely
metallic
maybe
they
never
upgraded
to
those
cans
with
the
liner
pretty
thin
mouthfeel
super
easy
to
drink
and
cheap
enough
that
it
isnt
associated
with
the
hipster
ironic
drinking
revival
overall
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
as
far
as
adjunct
grain
beers
go
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
as
with
most
cheap
lagers
i
recommend
ice
cold
and
in
a
can
poured
a
very
transparent
pale
straw
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
doesnt
smell
like
much
but
its
the
typical
corn
smell
the
taste
also
doesnt
break
the
adjunct
lager
mold
you
can
taste
the
grain
corn
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
soda
carbonation
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
of
course
there
isnt
anything
offensive
in
water
so
it
makes
sense
i
had
the
is
the
other
day
at
the
beer
because
it
was
on
special
for
2
00
otherwise
i
would
not
have
ordered
it
i
think
its
smilliar
to
high
ligh
life
or
pbr
i
think
its
a
good
beer
if
you
want
to
drink
a
few
beers
for
a
cheep
price
i
would
buy
it
again
if
its
on
special
but
not
for
more
that
2
bucks
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
this
category
ive
had
several
way
worse
i
am
a
craft
beer
drinker
so
this
is
never
a
beer
i
purchase
but
have
had
several
times
i
have
friends
that
do
drink
the
bmc
and
others
and
im
never
one
to
turn
down
a
free
drink
this
is
one
that
im
not
terrified
to
drink
the
first
thing
you
will
notice
about
this
beer
is
the
strong
cat
urine
smell
there
is
a
reason
why
a
12
pack
of
this
stuff
is
only
1
more
than
a
12
pack
of
soda
it
is
not
good
in
any
sense
of
the
word
the
smell
is
putrid
the
taste
of
old
watered
down
mgd
extreme
carbonation
brown
frothy
head
and
leaves
a
horrible
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
avoid
at
all
costs
overall
if
i
have
zero
options
this
is
a
passable
cheap
option
wal
mart
here
sells
30s
of
these
babys
for
16
just
thought
others
might
like
to
compare
its
all
they
sell
winco
the
local
supermarket
chain
here
sells
the
12s
i
have
fond
memories
of
this
beer
from
years
ago
ice
cold
from
plastic
cups
while
playing
softball
at
one
of
my
dads
union
picnics
i
was
about
12
and
even
then
i
remember
this
one
being
inferior
to
some
of
the
others
my
dad
drank
erlanger
lowenbrau
etc
anyways
figured
id
try
it
again
pretty
much
the
same
as
a
lot
of
the
other
macros
with
little
to
distinguish
itself
clear
yellow
color
fluffy
white
head
big
carbonation
grains
but
with
a
bear
d
not
a
bad
al
i
actually
sort
of
like
it
a
little
it
was
cheap
as
balls
and
taste
like
nothing
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
wanted
to
get
smashed
enjoy
i
almost
said
screw
it
im
moving
to
wisconsin
because
of
the
beer
here
this
place
is
great
d
well
about
as
drinkable
as
any
other
bmc
brew
around
crack
open
a
case
get
the
party
started
this
beer
isnt
anything
special
though
reminded
me
exactly
of
a
bud
being
a
bud
drinker
im
very
familiar
with
the
taste
not
bad
not
good
to
me
either
though
so
far
shlitz
has
been
my
favorite
in
the
style
eh
i
dont
recommend
it
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
beer
its
a
little
better
than
budweiser
but
not
as
good
as
schlitz
overall
this
stuff
aint
gonna
win
any
medals
but
id
still
take
it
over
that
beechwood
aged
for
extra
plywood
flavor
crap
any
day
from
the
land
of
sky
blue
waters
light
flavor
but
still
a
nice
suprise
md
highly
carbonated
light
body
feel
the
drinkability
is
ok
considering
the
taste
and
feel
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
notes
this
beer
is
great
for
what
it
is
its
an
excellent
alternative
to
most
of
the
macro
adjuncts
out
there
in
terms
of
both
price
and
flavor
in
this
way
i
would
liken
it
to
pbr
which
i
am
a
fan
of
think
of
it
as
pbrs
kid
brother
looking
up
to
and
aspiring
to
be
pbr
hamms
is
better
than
you
might
expect
if
youre
looking
for
a
very
cheap
beer
under
7
for
a
12pack
there
isnt
anything
overly
special
about
this
beer
but
it
is
more
flavorful
than
other
cheap
light
beers
the
drinkability
is
high
because
there
isnt
a
significant
amount
of
taste
it
is
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
at
once
give
hamms
a
try
it
isnt
the
worst
beer
around
the
taste
is
pretty
neutral
with
cereal
grains
and
a
mild
but
noticeable
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
beer
does
a
nice
job
of
keeping
the
sweetness
to
a
minimum
for
the
style
not
a
bad
aal
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
without
much
of
a
problem
drinkability
meh
actually
it
aspires
to
be
meh
more
like
bleh
great
macro
swill
for
the
price
its
got
all
you
could
expect
and
more
my
favorite
style
is
american
classic
macro
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
along
side
schmidts
oly
and
the
new
schlitz
hamms
served
at
32
degrees
is
as
good
as
it
gets
for
drinkability
can
yellow
and
fizzy
and
clear
and
urinesque
smells
like
stale
grains
old
corn
cesspool
water
flavor
is
not
as
watery
as
some
pale
lagers
but
unfortunately
the
lack
of
wateriness
is
replaced
with
an
abundance
of
cloying
corn
syrup
and
cereal
finish
is
mineral
and
short
yawn
best
to
drink
it
quick
it
if
gets
remotely
warm
youre
done
for
i
was
introduced
to
it
at
a
little
outoftheway
place
in
chicago
but
being
that
is
so
cheap
that
might
not
be
the
worst
problem
for
you
an
okay
local
beer
if
you
find
yourself
out
in
the
midwest
final
analysis
pretty
much
a
generic
american
adjunct
lager
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
this
same
exact
beer
is
sold
under
a
few
other
names
as
well
not
bad
not
good
just
mainstream
inexpensive
brew
d
representative
of
style
and
affordable
nothing
very
special
but
i
wouoldnt
turn
one
down
honorable
mention
this
beer
wins
the
prize
for
cheapest
twelve
pack
i
have
ever
purchased
i
got
a
big
rocky
two
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
nose
had
the
distinct
cereal
sweetness
that
is
associated
with
the
style
color
was
a
light
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
a
watery
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
very
mild
lawnmower
beer
gold
color
with
a
little
bit
of
prickle
almost
full
coverage
of
lacing
and
a
rim
of
foam
lots
of
grain
on
the
nose
but
it
stays
in
balance
with
the
malt
grainy
attack
with
some
mild
hops
in
the
flavor
but
dominated
by
the
grain
finishes
with
some
graininess
in
true
premium
lager
fashion
good
for
the
style
the
style
being
what
is
often
sold
as
cold
beer
hv
conclusion
1dimensional
odd
aftertaste
toast
is
nice
but
meh
no
thanks
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
with
decent
retention
smell
is
of
corn
hops
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
aroma
i
can
taste
the
hops
and
some
sweetness
which
is
a
plus
the
corn
grain
taste
is
also
present
but
is
not
unexpected
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
but
also
crisp
and
clean
got
to
take
the
bad
with
the
good
the
drinkability
is
average
definatly
a
decent
brew
and
the
price
is
terrific
perfectly
clear
pale
golden
body
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
melts
quickly
into
a
skim
of
foam
the
nose
is
pure
corny
grits
with
no
discernable
hops
present
at
all
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
still
a
lot
of
corniness
but
more
dry
than
most
adjunct
lagers
with
a
faint
suggestion
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
mostly
squeaky
clean
finish
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
i
was
looking
for
a
new
cheap
lawnmower
beer
to
replace
the
old
discontinued
schlitz
cans
i
think
i
found
it
d
compared
to
the
other
macros
i
would
say
this
kicks
there
ass
the
taste
is
just
really
there
reminds
me
of
the
beer
my
dad
used
to
drink
if
it
were
3
more
it
wouldnt
be
as
drinkable
as
it
is
at
about
50
cents
a
can
funny
how
economics
can
make
some
beers
more
drinkable
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
beer
overall
impression
about
as
good
a
macro
lager
as
youre
gonna
get
helluva
lawnmower
beer
overall
this
is
just
another
macro
lager
that
is
cheap
and
nothing
exciting
i
dont
plan
on
drinking
this
again
unless
it
is
free
light
color
flavor
taste
smell
presence
pretty
much
everything
but
it
goes
down
easily
and
i
think
the
half
i
consumed
from
the
can
as
opposed
to
the
glass
actually
tasted
better
perhaps
it
was
that
it
was
the
second
half
as
well
overall
highly
recommended
poured
from
12
oz
can
into
a
stein
d
again
for
the
style
not
badeasy
to
have
a
few
also
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
variety
of
foods
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
faint
bready
graininess
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
it
is
simple
but
a
little
stronger
than
most
adjunct
lagers
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
smooth
velvety
feel
most
beers
of
its
style
dont
have
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
adjunct
lager
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
this
beer
is
one
of
those
beers
that
swill
but
its
cool
to
drink
it
it
is
a
watery
lager
with
unsetteling
sweetness
but
like
natty
the
beast
and
pbr
it
is
always
cheap
and
alway
chic
this
is
swill
but
i
love
it
good
with
bluegill
and
making
brats
ordered
a
can
at
the
bryant
lake
bowl
in
minnapolis
i
just
had
to
try
it
and
now
i
have
ok
this
is
basically
pbr
extra
same
watery
sweetness
with
a
cheap
lager
tang
and
a
slightly
bigger
touch
of
spicy
hops
yeah
it
worth
trying
for
the
sake
of
trying
hamms
but
its
not
a
terribly
pleasant
beer
not
patently
offensive
but
the
taste
is
most
easily
described
as
cheap
watery
american
beer
d
this
ranks
in
at
5
and
change
by
volume
so
its
very
drinkable
i
usually
pick
pbr
over
this
but
for
11
99case
you
cant
go
wrong
best
enjoyed
from
the
can
although
the
review
was
from
a
glass
i
was
excited
when
i
bought
this
beer
i
felt
cool
like
a
born
again
college
frat
kid
then
i
remembered
why
i
never
wanted
to
be
in
a
frat
and
i
hated
almost
everyone
in
college
d
a
good
yard
work
and
family
barbecue
beer
in
the
bargain
beer
department
this
slots
in
alongside
pbr
for
me
since
a
12pack
of
hamms
goes
for
less
than
pbr
this
is
my
new
goto
cheap
beer
drinkability
is
better
than
average
one
of
my
favorite
us
macros
d
once
again
i
could
drink
hamms
all
night
its
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
american
lager
its
definitely
pretty
good
it
doesnt
taste
as
much
like
hair
as
pabst
its
not
as
watery
as
olympia
its
just
a
decent
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
light
body
and
bland
overall
sits
in
the
mouth
alright
especially
when
ice
cold
i
could
see
this
in
my
fridge
from
time
to
time
it
is
a
subpar
macrolager
that
is
cheap
and
will
do
the
job
hard
to
come
by
this
beer
and
when
i
saw
it
for
3
99
for
a
sixer
of
16oz
cans
i
just
had
to
have
it
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
excellent
for
sitting
around
a
camp
fire
or
on
a
hot
day
to
enjoy
a
couple
okay
i
am
updating
my
rating
from
last
time
i
do
not
know
if
i
had
a
skunked
batch
or
what
but
hamms
is
really
not
too
bad
for
being
the
cheapest
brew
12
pack
at
the
local
liquor
store
decent
taste
and
drinkability
have
made
this
one
of
my
new
summer
beers
im
sorry
hamms
this
one
is
just
undrinkable
for
me
drinkability
is
inhibited
by
the
stalenss
9
99
a
case
i
had
to
try
it
you
know
what
its
not
bad
much
better
than
any
popular
bmc
brand
light
yellow
color
smelled
better
than
your
typical
macro
but
taste
fantastic
i
wish
this
was
available
in
bottles
looks
like
its
going
to
be
a
hamms
summer
drinkability
is
not
good
this
is
a
subpar
macro
lager
the
malt
is
not
malty
but
rather
grainy
and
stale
at
that
there
is
no
hop
presence
which
leads
to
an
unbalanced
composition
not
recommended
poured
a
12oz
can
into
my
newcastle
pint
glass
pours
a
yellow
straw
with
just
a
slight
carbonation
aroma
is
mostly
corn
with
a
slight
sweetness
not
much
more
its
really
straight
forward
this
beer
tells
you
exactly
what
it
is
in
its
aroma
the
taste
is
just
the
same
no
exception
mouthfeel
is
light
with
just
a
slight
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
better
retros
its
a
really
great
lawn
mower
beer
d
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
delivering
more
than
i
expected
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
i
will
throw
a
few
of
these
into
the
beer
fridge
as
the
yard
work
season
heats
up
here
in
the
land
of
sky
blue
waters
this
was
left
over
from
a
party
ya
i
am
a
grown
man
and
someone
brought
this
to
my
house
poured
into
a
glass
this
has
a
wheat
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
before
i
put
the
can
down
there
was
almost
no
smell
at
all
maybe
a
little
skunk
but
nothing
else
very
bland
taste
with
mild
carbonation
not
much
else
to
say
as
far
as
a
hang
out
with
buddies
and
drink
a
few
beers
beer
its
not
something
id
bring
to
a
social
gathering
but
i
have
to
admit
it
could
be
worse
this
will
always
remind
me
of
johnnies
in
chicago
rip
review
more
of
an
ipa
man
myself
however
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
me
in
the
least
especially
considering
the
fact
that
a
paid
6
49
for
12
pack
i
can
say
without
a
doubt
that
for
the
money
this
is
the
best
beer
out
there
of
course
there
is
better
beer
out
there
but
if
you
want
some
cheap
beer
this
the
beer
the
taste
is
weak
dont
remember
it
being
this
weak
maybe
get
a
little
bit
of
the
hops
but
otherwise
is
beer
flavored
water
it
is
light
and
crisp
so
pounding
these
all
night
would
be
no
problem
maybe
that
is
why
i
liked
it
back
in
the
day
cheap
cheap
this
beer
is
very
hard
to
even
find
anymore
pissy
and
fizzy
soapy
head
the
smell
of
cheap
beer
made
from
substandard
ingredients
tastes
like
metal
hay
and
dirt
thin
and
watery
but
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
them
with
your
jerkoff
friends
around
a
campfire
the
price
is
the
indicator
when
you
buy
this
product
you
dont
buy
this
for
the
quality
you
buy
this
for
drinking
large
amounts
and
thats
a
purpose
it
serves
well
cheap
d
one
of
the
better
macros
ive
had
and
cheaper
than
bmc
to
boot
a
good
choice
if
youre
short
on
cash
but
want
a
beer
light
pale
yellow
appearance
minimal
malt
smells
and
taste
characteristics
thin
mouthfeel
havent
seen
this
in
the
store
for
years
thought
it
was
long
gone
reading
the
commercial
description
made
me
laugh
out
loud
another
classic
beer
produced
by
pabst
brewing
thats
hard
to
say
with
a
straight
face
my
dad
used
to
drink
this
in
the
60s
i
drank
it
in
high
school
some
in
the
early
80s
cheap
american
beer
no
this
one
is
straw
pale
and
a
ridiculously
easy
drink
exactly
what
i
want
when
i
want
something
refreshing
and
light
which
is
what
you
get
do
you
see
how
i
rated
this
beer
3
3
on
the
richter
scale
i
mean
good
grief
give
this
beer
a
break
in
1964
when
i
first
drank
this
mothers
milk
i
would
have
rated
it
3
3
it
hasnt
changed
thank
goodness
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
my
grandpa
and
dad
drank
when
coming
in
from
lawn
mowing
push
mower
i
might
add
sheeesh
lets
get
with
the
program
my
friends
and
honor
the
name
cherished
by
millions
of
teenagers
in
the
middle
60s
from
the
land
of
sky
blue
waters
and
always
will
be
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
i
picked
it
up
cause
i
thought
it
would
be
cool
to
try
the
taste
on
first
sip
is
all
sweet
malt
and
corn
a
few
more
sips
in
and
theres
some
citrusy
hops
mostly
lemon
in
the
background
that
is
most
noticeable
near
and
through
the
finish
but
i
cant
say
it
does
a
good
enough
job
to
save
this
beer
from
a
short
and
less
than
stellar
review
from
yours
truly
drinkability
this
was
surprisingly
balanced
and
refreshing
stays
looking
good
superior
mouthfeel
to
other
aml
i
got
a
headache
after
i
finished
the
2nd
can
and
needed
to
take
asprin
and
switch
to
iced
tea
despite
all
of
that
it
is
very
drinkable
would
be
good
for
the
summer
after
mowing
the
lawn
and
they
had
a
cool
macot
once
dress
up
in
his
costume
visit
a
strip
club
and
see
what
happens
as
noted
in
the
old
style
review
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
pabst
the
beer
they
create
these
two
plus
pabst
blue
ribbon
especially
is
so
superior
to
budweiser
miller
and
coors
products
that
im
surprised
at
the
sales
figures
well
maybe
im
not
advertising
dollars
usually
win
out
even
though
hamms
is
technically
the
loser
of
macsmack
xiv
its
still
worthwhile
beer
for
when
you
have
a
hankering
to
go
old
school
i
found
this
little
gem
in
the
batesville
liquior
store
in
batesville
in
it
is
not
bad
for
a
macrobrew
it
is
also
very
cheap
it
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
a
crisp
finish
you
can
taste
the
corn
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
in
hoosierland
reviewing
this
for
what
it
is
an
inexpensive
lawnmower
beer
if
you
start
with
the
macro
brew
idea
firmly
implanted
you
wont
be
disappointed
drinkability
is
excellent
because
you
wont
notice
the
first
2
overall
a
better
choice
to
me
than
miller
lite
or
bud
for
a
softball
game
or
the
weekend
fishing
trip
d
overall
it
is
fairly
good
considering
the
price
it
is
a
bargain
i
bought
a
40
of
this
and
iced
that
baby
up
it
had
a
dirty
corn
taste
some
sweet
cereal
malts
and
a
little
more
body
than
your
average
cheapo
cruddy
lager
it
put
a
hurtin
on
me
somethin
fierce
though
dull
yellow
in
appearance
and
almost
no
head
this
one
needs
to
get
really
cold
before
one
should
attempt
it
finish
it
quick
before
it
warms
up
a
good
accompaniment
to
oreos
cheatoz
bbq
fritos
and
honeybuns
dim
sun
yellow
thick
and
frothy
white
head
great
retention
and
some
apeasing
lace
is
left
as
well
aroma
is
corny
grainy
and
sweet
not
off
putting
by
any
means
very
agreeable
taste
mild
malts
sweet
wort
like
graininess
a
touch
of
hop
dryness
i
think
body
is
heft
for
a
macro
id
call
it
medium
to
mediumfull
one
of
the
better
macros
ive
had
in
a
long
time
if
you
check
my
reviews
you
will
note
that
i
do
not
generally
give
such
low
scores
but
in
this
case
im
going
as
low
as
possible
to
save
my
fellow
advocates
the
pain
get
my
buzz
on
n
hamms
is
a
solid
beer
and
great
for
drinking
when
pbr
and
schlitz
arent
available
its
very
bitter
for
the
style
putting
bmc
brews
to
shame
the
best
part
about
drinking
hamms
is
that
when
you
drink
it
people
watching
all
think
wow
now
thats
a
manwell
either
that
or
wow
now
thats
a
drunk
hamms
appearance
is
very
similar
to
its
cousins
pbr
old
style
schlitz
and
blatz
when
you
poor
hamms
into
a
glass
which
should
always
be
frosted
because
hamms
in
a
frosted
glass
has
no
negative
flavors
whatsoever
you
will
see
that
it
has
a
two
inch
thick
frothy
white
head
for
nearly
1
3
seconds
after
that
the
froth
becomes
a
thin
glass
clinging
lace
the
body
is
hydrated
urine
with
tons
of
carbonation
hamms
has
a
great
lightly
hopped
metallic
aroma
and
really
tells
you
that
the
slightest
amount
of
malt
just
might
be
involved
someplace
in
the
beer
the
taste
is
even
better
and
makes
it
obvious
that
hamms
is
only
made
with
sky
blue
waters
there
is
even
a
little
bit
of
grain
in
hamms
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
as
aforementioned
bitter
it
goes
down
really
well
the
only
bad
thing
about
hamms
is
that
its
proudly
made
by
unions
which
means
that
for
every
8
you
spend
on
a
case
a
penny
or
so
is
going
to
eliminate
american
jobs
and
ruin
our
economy
thats
just
sad
but
overall
the
strong
points
of
hamms
more
then
make
up
for
that
one
small
down
side
pours
a
pale
straw
color
topped
by
a
small
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
not
good
not
bad
just
not
much
of
anything
palate
is
lightly
sweet
with
very
light
adjunct
malt
and
just
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
finish
is
clean
and
slightly
bitter
body
is
light
a
tad
fizzy
and
a
little
bit
tangy
on
the
finish
i
will
say
this
you
can
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
good
in
the
large
quantities
preferred
by
nondiscriminating
types
what
can
i
say
if
i
ever
had
to
drink
a
lot
of
beers
again
id
still
have
to
choose
hamms
at
14
a
30
pack
you
just
cant
go
wrong
well
perhaps
i
was
being
under
the
annoyance
of
those
central
america
beers
with
a
lot
of
corn
additives
but
i
really
did
not
like
this
one
i
found
a
lot
of
those
in
it
and
really
wanted
to
throw
it
away
after
a
while
but
going
backwards
it
had
a
nice
bread
smell
12
oz
can
obtained
from
a
local
grocery
hyvee
and
consumed
a
couple
days
later
pours
a
onefinger
white
fiszzy
settling
head
over
a
crystal
clear
very
light
straw
colored
liquid
smells
mild
hop
and
2row
barley
sweet
tastes
watery
malt
sweet
is
very
gentle
hop
presence
is
there
but
its
amazingly
low
as
it
warms
i
get
some
saaz
and
maybe
hallertauer
watery
mouthfeel
and
sharp
carbonation
thats
actually
part
of
the
taste
profile
because
theres
not
much
here
to
taste
in
conclusion
the
beer
refreshing
it
certainly
could
be
if
the
beer
is
cold
enough
and
the
day
is
hot
enough
land
of
sky
blue
waters
probably
not
unless
milwaukee
moved
away
from
milwaukee
the
taste
coming
from
the
same
sensory
mechanism
of
smell
is
not
that
different
its
thin
very
light
in
flavors
that
are
predominantly
sweet
malt
and
just
a
turning
edge
of
bitterness
nothing
strong
nothing
assertive
but
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
plus
its
union
made
that
helps
when
its
this
cheap
after
checking
my
records
it
has
been
some
ten
years
since
i
have
had
a
hamms
the
beer
spews
from
the
12ounce
aluminum
can
a
cloudless
gold
with
a
pleasant
bright
white
head
that
is
frothy
in
texture
with
the
resultant
lace
a
thin
covering
upon
the
glass
nose
is
all
malt
crisp
and
the
start
sweet
with
the
top
cadaverous
finish
is
caustic
in
its
acidity
the
hops
bitter
and
unpleasant
quite
dry
and
the
taste
sticks
to
your
palate
like
crazy
glue
a
once
decent
beer
that
has
now
become
a
joke
do
yourself
a
favor
and
buy
a
schlitz
or
pbr
instead
and
we
come
to
another
once
of
the
crappy
beers
on
my
list
to
purchase
and
try
this
is
the
current
case
i
have
sitting
in
my
fridge
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
this
was
the
worst
beer
he
has
ever
had
and
quite
frankly
he
couldnt
be
wrong
this
beer
just
has
a
bad
carbonated
corn
taste
that
turns
me
off
it
is
more
full
than
competing
beers
but
this
isnt
saying
much
at
all
each
of
the
cheap
macro
brews
has
their
own
subtle
taste
after
you
are
hit
with
the
carbonation
and
watery
generic
beer
flavor
and
hamms
has
been
the
worst
to
date
i
hold
this
up
there
with
strohs
schlitz
still
remains
my
number
one
go
to
beer
when
the
funds
are
low
and
the
need
for
feed
is
high
the
case
was
under
ten
dollars
so
it
is
one
of
the
few
beers
out
there
that
you
can
still
get
somewhat
of
a
bargain
on
this
tastes
like
the
breath
of
a
man
who
lives
on
the
street
and
does
nothing
but
drink
natural
ice
it
tastes
likes
that
mans
pee
there
is
nothing
nothing
in
this
world
worse
than
hamms
i
just
had
to
try
another
one
just
to
tell
myself
how
bad
it
was
this
was
a
shock
from
the
past
that
i
will
not
soon
forget
this
beer
is
almost
acceptable
medium
gold
with
a
big
white
head
smells
a
lot
like
grain
and
a
little
like
malt
taste
is
actually
more
complex
than
most
cheap
beers
starts
out
with
a
watery
malt
flavor
then
passes
into
an
adjunct
flavor
for
its
very
low
12
99
a
30
pack
price
this
is
quite
a
deal
okay
with
a
beer
fridge
full
of
imports
and
domestic
microbrews
i
really
feel
guilty
about
this
one
im
slummingit
in
the
greatest
sense
but
and
as
the
saying
goes
its
a
big
but
this
stuff
aint
bad
sure
it
lacks
anything
that
could
be
called
character
but
it
is
what
it
is
this
cheap
macroswill
actually
stands
up
its
got
more
taste
then
you
might
think
and
its
best
served
very
cold
in
a
tall
glass
the
quicker
you
drink
it
the
better
because
it
does
show
some
negativity
near
the
end
but
it
is
refreshing
and
the
first
few
sips
are
pretty
good
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
i
must
say
that
adds
something
but
at
4
5012
pack
you
cant
beat
it
its
a
quiet
beer
that
has
survived
no
mattter
what
part
of
the
bottom
shelf
its
hiding
on
beneath
the
boulevards
and
the
fullers
etc
etc
etc
dig
it
out
this
might
surprise
you
its
not
trying
to
be
great
but
it
does
a
pretty
good
job
at
being
good
better
than
average
and
most
of
all
refreshing
good
golly
here
we
go
same
look
as
most
beers
in
this
price
catagory
reminds
me
of
a
headache
the
smell
actually
gives
me
one
or
was
it
the
truckload
of
beer
i
had
last
night
either
way
you
are
getting
what
you
pay
for
with
this
one
a
buzz
taste
is
not
great
better
priced
than
some
of
the
other
shitty
beers
however
all
in
all
not
sweet
remember
when
hamms
was
huge
back
in
70s
for
a
while
this
stuff
was
truly
foul
when
general
or
pabst
owned
this
brand
i
really
think
they
just
mixed
together
some
chemicals
to
make
yellow
foaming
liquid
that
got
yo
buzzed
today
i
believe
sabmiller
brews
this
stuff
and
the
quality
of
their
operation
shows
in
the
product
definitely
worth
a
try
hamms
yes
the
beer
from
sky
blue
waters
hamms
refreshing
hamms
cripes
its
been
along
time
since
ive
seen
this
beer
and
longer
since
ive
had
it
it
pours
from
the
can
a
panther
piss
yellow
a
vigorous
pour
stirs
up
the
bubbles
but
not
long
enough
to
register
a
head
that
impresses
itself
thick
gorgeous
belgian
lace
true
or
false
the
last
sentence
was
not
sarcastic
adjuncty
barn
yard
aroma
the
taste
aint
half
as
bad
as
it
ought
to
be
mainly
because
its
not
got
much
taste
at
all
sweet
corny
light
bodied
hell
i
bought
it
as
a
lark
yet
im
not
wholly
dissatisfied
two
dollars
and
fortynine
cents
for
a
smoking
hot
six
of
hamms
money
not
totally
wasted
a
side
note
my
favourite
beer
glass
which
i
sample
most
of
my
beers
in
is
a
classic
hamms
pint
schooner
oh
the
nostalgia
another
of
the
great
american
classic
lagers
the
hamms
brew
filled
a
spot
in
the
lineup
of
not
bad
cheap
beers
good
looking
pour
of
clear
straw
color
and
a
34
inch
white
head
malt
nose
with
a
faint
trace
of
hops
the
flavor
moderates
with
warming
and
moves
from
sweet
maltiness
to
a
grain
sense
it
was
a
decent
enough
beer
for
the
price
but
not
enough
staying
power
against
the
macros
note
this
beer
grew
on
me
i
did
buy
more
much
more
a
good
backyard
bbq
swiller
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
had
when
i
went
off
to
college
i
tried
it
as
i
had
never
heard
of
if
and
wanted
to
do
something
different
than
all
my
roommates
who
were
bud
lovers
its
not
an
expensive
beer
and
it
shows
the
flavor
is
not
great
but
not
terrible
either
it
had
a
light
aroma
and
a
slightly
chemical
taste
there
was
little
or
no
corn
hops
flavor
and
seemed
kind
of
watery
either
way
i
cant
find
it
anymore
and
bud
has
taken
its
space
on
the
shelves
which
pisses
me
off
overall
not
bad
if
it
was
there
id
drink
it
this
is
not
as
bad
as
expected
it
is
not
a
great
beer
in
fact
it
borders
on
crap
but
i
wouldnt
complain
if
i
got
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
dry
white
head
which
is
gone
in
seconds
taste
is
of
corn
hoppiness
is
weak
very
little
if
any
malt
flavor
still
an
interesting
american
lager
light
yellow
head
reached
about
a
inch
spotty
lace
the
nose
is
sweet
like
corn
the
taste
is
sweet
like
corn
once
this
beer
warmed
even
minimally
it
really
started
to
taste
cheap
when
the
beer
was
cold
it
was
okay
now
that
i
have
tried
hamms
i
can
move
on
i
dont
need
to
go
back
as
far
as
cheap
beers
go
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
hamms
has
a
decent
taste
to
it
but
you
still
need
to
drink
it
quickly
since
its
taste
goes
downhill
when
achieving
room
temperature
i
would
never
buy
hamms
myself
but
i
dont
have
a
problem
drinking
it
at
a
buddies
house
since
im
from
the
land
of
sky
blue
waters
i
thought
it
was
worth
a
shot
as
i
really
like
the
hamms
genuine
draft
this
is
not
a
good
macro
lager
but
its
not
a
horrible
one
either
its
drinkable
crisp
and
clean
some
adjunct
taste
and
smell
cornish
im
not
sure
how
close
this
resembles
the
original
hamms
but
it
is
not
worth
seeking
out
i
think
the
original
hamms
was
a
coorsolympia
type
lighterthinner
style
lager
this
one
seems
to
have
too
much
adjunctcorn
taste
to
it
still
its
not
a
horrible
beer
this
label
i
think
was
first
sold
to
pabst
and
now
is
in
millers
hands
this
beer
was
a
very
pale
yellow
color
and
formed
really
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
of
grain
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
grain
and
some
alcohol
very
light
beer
and
not
much
in
the
finish
i
had
totally
forgotten
about
this
beer
i
really
think
that
some
macro
beer
companies
need
to
rethink
their
policies
cheap
beer
should
have
at
least
one
redeeming
quality
which
is
drinkability
this
one
does
not
have
that
holy
sin
this
was
bad
bad
bad
bad
it
was
rancid
and
tasted
the
part
yeast
from
here
to
there
not
the
good
culture
either
something
youd
go
to
the
pharmacy
for
thank
goodness
i
didnt
have
to
pay
for
it
notes
this
is
a
damn
fine
union
made
beer
and
certainly
better
than
its
more
marketable
brethren
its
simple
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
best
part
is
its
2
99
a
6pak
price
tag
regardless
if
it
were
at
a
party
id
take
it
instead
of
a
budweiser
any
day
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
totally
dissipated
within
60
seconds
not
much
taste
at
all
i
will
not
buy
this
again
i
thought
this
is
a
perfectly
serviceable
aal
on
par
with
old
milwaukee
this
is
pittsburgh
in
a
can
if
you
dont
like
it
leave
it
really
only
comes
into
its
own
when
you
drop
a
shot
of
jack
daniels
into
it
and
guzzle
it
down
cuts
through
the
dirt
and
dust
of
a
hard
days
work
and
makes
you
proud
to
be
a
steelers
fan
out
of
the
can
it
pours
the
typical
yellow
tinge
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
nothing
overly
special
the
scent
of
the
brew
is
just
not
appealing
to
me
however
i
did
note
some
hints
of
citrus
and
spice
in
the
overall
flavor
mixing
well
with
the
hops
so
that
was
a
plus
overall
its
not
quite
okay
but
its
certainly
not
the
worst
ive
had
this
beer
is
a
comfort
beer
for
me
i
grew
up
around
pittsburgh
and
iron
city
was
alway
supporting
the
local
sports
teams
steelers
pirates
and
penguins
i
like
it
because
it
reminds
me
of
my
favorite
city
pittsburgh
or
should
i
say
sixburgh
pours
a
hazy
honey
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
but
settled
back
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
corn
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
about
the
same
and
actually
surprised
how
sweet
this
beer
is
sweet
corn
and
grains
for
the
most
part
very
slight
dry
finish
overall
it
was
just
ok
i
made
the
mistake
of
trying
this
beer
with
a
buddy
of
mine
who
claimed
that
it
was
a
classic
im
not
going
to
waste
time
with
an
in
depth
review
but
believe
me
when
i
say
that
it
was
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
tried
it
after
having
drank
several
good
craft
brews
before
allowing
it
to
pass
my
lips
im
not
100
sure
either
way
it
wont
be
something
i
drink
again
unless
its
in
post
apocalyptic
world
and
its
the
only
beer
i
can
find
the
only
thing
good
about
iron
city
was
the
laugh
it
provided
my
buddy
as
i
spit
it
out
not
very
good
not
even
crisp
which
is
hard
not
to
do
for
the
style
tastes
the
same
going
in
as
it
does
going
out
avoid
unless
youre
deeply
and
delusionally
nostalgic
if
you
gotta
go
pennsylvanian
then
go
yuengling
or
troegs
or
even
rolling
rock
before
you
go
here
pitt
has
a
lot
of
other
things
going
for
it
warhol
stellers
u
pitt
etc
the
beer
aint
one
of
those
things
i
have
to
qualify
my
feelings
about
ic
beer
i
do
not
like
heavy
hops
ipa
beers
a
lot
of
mentions
of
icb
tasting
like
piss
ive
never
drunk
piss
but
i
imagine
the
piss
of
an
old
drunk
would
taste
like
an
ipa
i
drink
beer
because
im
thirsty
and
i
like
a
little
buzz
when
im
home
on
the
weekends
icb
is
refreshing
and
doesnt
make
me
want
to
go
gargle
to
get
rid
of
the
obnoxious
taste
in
my
throat
somebody
mentioned
pbr
in
their
comparison
with
icb
i
really
dont
care
for
the
the
taste
of
pbr
or
a
heavy
ipa
when
im
thirsty
and
thats
the
only
time
i
drink
beer
i
dont
give
a
crap
about
the
head
and
how
long
it
lasts
could
we
be
a
little
more
pretentious
lacing
jc
almighty
its
beer
i
like
a
beer
without
a
sour
aftertaste
like
most
ipas
ive
tried
i
like
iron
city
beer
i
dont
know
whats
wrong
with
your
noses
i
have
never
smelled
any
of
the
odors
others
have
described
maybe
they
should
pick
there
noses
and
blow
them
before
they
drink
i
wish
icb
was
distributed
in
va
but
it
isnt
when
my
mil
was
still
alive
and
wed
go
visit
her
id
bring
back
6
cases
of
ic
light
and
a
couple
of
regular
ic
beer
drinkers
that
try
to
act
like
wine
connoisseurs
are
a
little
over
the
top
for
me
its
beer
enjoy
it
when
youre
thirsty
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
drink
jack
i
find
is
tastes
and
smells
very
good
and
it
is
refreshing
o
it
is
not
as
bad
as
some
of
the
other
offerings
in
the
style
especially
the
bmc
offerings
i
could
easily
put
back
a
couple
of
these
when
tailgating
with
grilled
foods
but
not
really
interesting
enough
to
have
regularly
my
first
mistake
was
probably
getting
it
in
can
form
it
had
a
slightly
skunky
metallic
odor
to
it
much
like
a
can
of
steel
reserve
right
then
and
there
i
decided
not
to
bother
pouring
it
into
a
glass
i
didnt
want
to
dirty
another
dish
for
nothing
the
taste
screams
malt
liquor
only
it
doesnt
have
all
the
alcohol
percentage
to
make
up
for
the
bad
taste
the
flavor
i
can
only
describe
as
if
someone
cooled
a
molten
rod
of
steel
into
some
watered
down
horse
piss
it
had
a
carbonation
sting
at
the
tip
of
my
tongue
and
coats
the
back
of
my
throat
like
phlegm
from
a
mild
cold
and
then
after
only
one
beer
comes
the
headache
it
was
9
50
for
a
12
pack
i
could
have
made
a
better
choice
but
i
wanted
to
try
something
new
i
probably
wont
drink
it
again
unless
a
tribal
chief
of
headhunters
gave
it
to
me
as
a
gift
and
i
was
afraid
of
insulting
them
by
not
drinking
it
therefore
having
my
head
wind
up
on
a
pike
okay
it
says
i
need
to
make
more
words
so
go
steelers

who

its

just
shut
up
and
drink
it
like
a
man
overall
this
is
basically
what
i
expect
out
of
pittsburgh
a
subpar
beer
oh
well
they
give
us
the
steelers
ans
this
not
really
sure
which
one
is
less
offensive
frankly
o
sigh
im
feeling
generous
1
75
since
it
had
a
bit
of
utility
as
a
quick
fix
to
the
age
old
why
dont
we
have
any
beer
conundrum
everyone
should
try
drinking
a
12
oz
er
at
least
once
in
hisher
life
just
to
know
where
some
of
the
lowerlimits
on
industrial
beer
production
exist
ive
been
circling
this
one
like
an
uninterested
ticking
vulture
an
endangered
species
for
a
while
now
only
now
getting
around
to
actually
trying
it
gotta
love
mixed
sixers
amiright
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
corn
lightly
funky
wheat
and
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
strange
twinge
of
lemonlike
fruit
that
just
seems
out
of
place
and
enhances
a
heretofore
lowlying
metallic
quality
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
limp
little
beer
one
that
just
makes
me
wonder
why
im
not
just
drinking
water
pale
even
for
an
adjunct
lagerlooks
more
like
a
light
lager
looks
can
be
deceiving
though
as
the
aroma
is
a
complex
mix
of
corn
and
caramel
with
some
bready
notes
taste
is
heavy
on
the
corn
and
grain
at
first
with
some
apple
coming
through
as
the
beer
gets
warmer
very
dry
flavor
with
no
noticeable
must
or
bitterness
from
what
i
recall
of
the
canned
version
which
i
had
last
winter
this
one
is
a
lot
more
pleasant
to
drink
overall
mostly
an
average
american
adjunct
lager
but
possibly
a
slight
bit
above
average
as
its
flavors
are
a
bit
on
the
more
potent
and
easy
drinking
side
o
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
macro
maybe
slightly
better
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
if
youre
looking
for
something
cheap
to
drink
while
mowing
the
lawn
and
arent
in
the
mood
for
pbr
this
is
an
apt
replacement
if
your
going
to
drink
other
undistinguished
beers
like
budweiser
pabst
or
miller
give
iron
city
a
shot
iron
city
wont
win
any
brewing
medals
but
keep
a
six
pack
in
the
fridge
and
you
wont
find
anyone
turning
it
down
at
a
party
o
overall
a
good
beer
to
drink
at
ball
games
and
local
sporting
events
or
where
ever
so
there
it
is
have
some
neighbors
from
pa
who
probably
worship
the
stuff
so
thats
what
they
will
be
served
at
my
super
bowl
party
in
two
weeks
enjoy
drinking
local
beers
when
i
am
out
of
town
so
gave
this
a
try
because
its
been
in
pittsburgh
for
awhile
but
pretty
not
owned
locally
anymore
regardless
gave
it
a
try
didnt
enjoy
it
that
much
sometimes
can
beer
doesnt
taste
the
best
but
still
didnt
like
the
taste
nor
the
mouthful
smell
was
sub
par
and
had
left
a
bad
aftertaste
with
me
wouldnt
recommend
it
thin
and
astringent
harsh
metallic
tang
perceptible
alcohol
slightly
fruity
aftertaste
but
not
enough
to
redeem
it
papery
wet
mealy
soggy
crackers
the
astringency
is
awful
and
a
real
dealbreaker
here
not
real
sure
why
this
is
iron
citys
flagship
beer
its
terrible
this
is
my
first
iron
city
since
leaving
pa
i
can
see
why
i
had
so
many
of
these
in
college
for
the
style
its
better
than
most
rjt
overall
this
is
a
plainjane
lager
it
is
better
than
a
lot
of
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
but
it
is
not
a
particularly
good
or
exciting
beer
o
nothing
wrong
with
an
old
school
beer
once
in
a
while
better
than
most
of
the
bmc
offerings
dno
thanks
dont
have
to
try
this
again
it
is
a
big
beer
in
pittsburgh
but
i
can
do
with
out
trying
this
one
again
overall
not
something
i
would
buy
again
seems
like
this
brand
is
on
the
downfall
i
got
it
because
it
was
cheap
and
chose
it
because
it
was
local
but
dont
really
think
its
pittsburghs
true
beer
anymore
wasnt
that
fascinated
by
it
and
didnt
have
much
of
a
taste
either
had
a
bad
aftertaste
and
would
prefer
many
more
beers
in
front
of
this
one
taste
tastes
like
a
cheap
american
beer
but
id
take
this
over
a
bud
or
miller
any
day
if
only
to
drink
something
regional
and
local
overall
neither
bad
nor
good
but
leaning
towards
the
good
side
the
cpj
eh
m
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
quite
sweet
in
one
fell
swoop
i
can
cross
primanti
bros
and
ic
off
my
bucket
list
i
wasnt
impressed
with
either
overall
i
will
probably
never
buy
this
again
just
bought
it
because
ive
always
seen
it
and
heard
of
it
i
would
rather
buy
a
cheaper
bmc
product
mouthfeel
did
i
just
drink
something
overall
this
is
what
i
left
behind
when
i
started
drinking
craft
beer
and
its
good
to
be
reminded
why
i
wont
accept
any
crap
on
tap
d
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
except
perhaps
for
the
novelty
of
it
like
if
i
was
in
pittsburgh
or
wanted
to
punish
someone
well
for
a
beer
of
this
type
its
pretty
good
a
lot
beefier
in
terms
of
taste
than
other
adjunct
lagers
it
pours
a
nice
yellow
color
but
the
smell
im
not
crazy
about
drink
is
alright
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
d
the
beer
isnt
very
interesting
but
it
wasnt
a
drain
pour
because
it
has
enough
flavors
and
body
to
keep
it
from
being
watery
dthis
goes
down
easily
i
do
not
regret
getting
an
entire
6pack
for
the
game
but
seeing
how
this
game
is
progressing
i
might
need
to
upgrade
to
something
stronger
on
the
plus
side
there
are
some
hop
notes
and
the
malt
is
sweeter
than
many
cheap
beers
well
balanced
for
a
cheap
beer
usually
drink
this
when
i
visit
pittsburgh
apperance
is
actually
good
for
this
type
of
lager
light
golden
with
a
half
inch
thick
creamyfrothy
white
head
that
actually
sticks
around
aroma
however
is
the
usual
sour
corn
mash
cardboard
mess
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
the
corn
is
there
in
abundance
but
mt
so
sour
and
the
malts
actually
seem
nice
and
present
nice
semi
sweet
finish
good
on
the
palate
that
is
above
average
for
style
goes
down
well
overall
a
nice
american
lager
reminds
me
a
bit
of
full
sails
session
simple
traditional
american
beer
i
would
much
prefer
this
to
most
any
macro
product
out
there
i
havent
had
to
many
craft
adjunct
lagers
but
hopefully
i
can
try
more
of
those
soon
i
bought
this
because
it
reminded
me
of
the
steelers
and
i
needed
to
finish
a
mix
6
pack
was
looking
for
stuff
i
havent
had
will
i
buy
this
again
doubt
it
but
was
worth
a
try
a
clear
pale
gold
complexion
with
a
medium
head
looks
and
feels
a
lot
like
its
mainstream
lager
cousins
as
the
scent
and
flavor
are
grainy
with
hints
of
corn
and
honey
lightbodied
but
crisp
nonetheless
with
a
malty
adjunct
feel
not
spectacular
or
memorable
but
a
solid
light
lager
that
more
than
holds
its
own
against
the
corporate
beers
d
alright
for
a
lawnmower
beer
but
not
by
much
overly
adjunctcooked
corn
sweetness
not
enough
balance
no
noticeable
hops
very
little
malt
character
i
would
almost
rather
have
a
bl
lime
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
fast
receding
head
that
fades
just
as
quickly
as
it
forms
leaving
just
bubbles
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
aromas
of
faint
faded
malts
make
their
way
into
the
nose
along
with
notes
resembling
creamed
corn
from
the
can
a
bit
of
lime
or
citrus
sweetness
and
some
spicyness
this
beer
is
overly
sweet
while
at
the
same
time
lacking
a
decent
malt
presence
to
balance
it
out
their
is
a
faint
hoppiness
that
is
hardly
noticeable
while
definite
adjunct
notes
are
present
alcohol
is
just
barely
noticeable
in
the
taste
very
light
body
with
a
decent
carbonation
profile
overall
this
beer
is
way
too
sweet
and
very
unbalanced
avoid
d
these
adjunct
lagers
are
what
they
are
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
in
flavor
picked
this
up
as
a
testing
beer
while
brewing
my
3rd
batch
of
beer
my
friend
is
from
pittsburgh
so
we
gave
it
a
try
we
were
not
impressed
it
was
lighter
than
expected
sort
of
had
a
funky
smell
similar
to
that
of
steel
reserve
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
however
the
remaining
bottles
from
the
6
pack
will
probably
sit
in
my
beer
fridge
until
i
finally
decide
to
pour
them
out
when
poured
into
a
glass
it
did
not
retain
much
head
and
very
little
streaking
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
bought
at
lifesource
salem
12
oz
single
apperance
is
actually
good
for
this
type
of
lager
light
golden
with
a
half
inch
thick
creamyfrothy
white
head
that
actually
sticks
around
aroma
however
is
the
usual
sour
corn
mash
cardboard
mess
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
the
corn
is
there
in
abundance
but
mt
so
sour
and
the
malts
actually
seem
nice
and
present
nice
semi
sweet
finish
good
on
the
palate
that
is
above
average
for
style
goes
down
well
overall
a
nice
american
lager
reminds
me
a
bit
of
full
sails
session
simple
traditional
american
beer
dno
thanks
i
was
surprised
to
see
there
is
one
want
for
this
beer
good
tail
gating
beer
at
steelers
games
nothing
special
about
this
beer
though
other
than
its
name
in
my
opinion
fun
to
drink
but
it
will
leave
you
wanting
your
comfort
beer
the
taste
is
crisp
but
a
tad
bitter
in
the
after
taste
the
apperance
is
bland
but
hey
go
steelers
definately
worth
a
taste
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
just
the
kiss
of
death
for
my
night
no
more
for
me
d
i
always
have
at
least
one
in
pittsburgh
but
other
than
that
its
not
a
great
beer
easy
to
throw
back
though
but
no
flavor
poured
with
a
straw
color
and
a
non
existent
head
sporadic
carbonation
smells
like
metal
and
corn
not
pleasing
tastes
like
corn
flakes
hay
and
a
nickle
all
at
the
same
time
very
sweet
and
thin
its
adjunct
lager
and
it
passed
the
mouthfeel
test
for
this
style
you
can
drink
this
at
a
football
game
particularly
the
steelers
d
you
could
probably
drink
this
in
place
of
water
as
there
is
no
actual
bad
flavor
but
why
bother
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
decent
drinkability
i
bought
the
sixer
in
colorado
and
will
finish
the
other
cans
but
theres
no
reason
to
revisit
d
pretty
much
the
high
point
and
only
point
in
buying
as
with
any
run
of
the
mill
bmc
buy
again
only
in
pittsburgh
taste
is
a
little
sweet
bonus
no
hops
barely
cooked
malt
very
watery
no
mouthfeel
just
the
same
barely
there
affect
going
on
drinkable
like
water
but
a
little
pricey
for
what
it
is
pretty
hard
to
drink
cant
see
what
you
would
be
doing
drinking
this
unless
you
wanted
a
buzz
and
hated
your
life
i
buy
this
for
steelers
parties
and
the
like
as
it
is
from
near
the
burg
and
is
usually
really
cheap
if
i
am
looking
for
a
better
local
beer
usually
i
buy
yuengling
or
something
from
the
curch
pbr
is
a
much
better
cheep
beer
but
this
is
better
than
some
beers
like
the
beast
not
something
i
will
buy
or
give
to
someone
i
consider
a
friend
not
horrible
but
not
too
impressive
either
i
can
see
it
going
ok
with
a
pizza
or
on
a
warm
day
full
of
yard
work
otherwise
steer
clear
of
this
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
i
know
it
has
a
following
but
it
is
not
for
me
ok
i
love
iron
city
it
may
be
from
the
history
or
something
i
dont
know
always
loved
drinking
it
at
steelers
games
so
i
may
be
a
little
biased
i
still
like
though
have
to
admit
have
not
tried
it
since
it
is
now
brewed
in
latrobe
it
may
not
be
the
same
but
i
have
always
thought
iron
city
is
what
represents
pittsburgh
it
has
been
there
since
the
the
1800s
d
i
have
to
say
i
was
fairly
warned
and
this
beer
lived
up
to
its
nickname
if
given
the
option
between
this
and
bud
light
id
go
to
bud
light
provided
water
wasnt
even
available
it
seems
to
me
that
now
they
are
making
it
in
latrobe
they
have
compeltely
changed
it
for
the
worse
and
i
hate
that
as
i
compared
a
can
of
the
old
with
the
new
tonight
and
the
old
was
wonderful
and
like
drinking
good
sweet
corn
and
this
is
nothing
like
the
iron
city
i
drank
for
many
years
sadly
someone
has
competely
changed
its
makeup
meh
if
this
was
all
that
was
available
i
could
drink
it
as
long
as
im
not
paying
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hints
of
corn
taste
is
crisp
some
corn
and
malts
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
mediocre
in
every
catagory
overall
im
glad
my
buddy
got
this
for
me
i
know
never
to
pick
it
up
if
im
ever
in
the
burgh
this
is
way
too
sweet
and
uninteresting
to
make
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
dont
care
for
the
yellow
fizzy
lagers
of
bud
miller
and
coors
but
there
is
something
about
a
regional
yellow
fizzy
lager
that
i
feel
better
about
drinking
there
isnt
much
there
just
a
faint
taste
of
malt
and
the
basic
rice
and
corn
adjuncts
but
its
drinkability
is
pretty
good
wouldnt
be
too
hard
to
quaff
quite
a
few
of
these
with
hardly
any
aftertaste
though
it
does
need
to
be
quite
cold
i
am
redoing
my
review
on
this
one
i
actually
dont
mind
the
tatse
of
this
beer
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
not
alot
of
carbonation
and
at
a
ball
game
its
pretty
good
however
this
beer
gives
me
a
headache
i
ran
into
someone
who
sells
beer
and
he
mentioned
off
hand
it
does
the
same
to
him
he
says
the
water
used
to
make
this
beer
is
bad
with
alot
of
impurities
in
it
thus
causing
the
headaches
too
bad
because
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
to
me
a
hard
pour
only
produced
a
thin
layer
of
head
which
vanished
all
too
quickly
a
little
skunky
smell
which
is
somewhat
surprising
given
that
it
was
in
a
brown
bottle
judging
by
the
taste
i
would
say
this
is
an
all
malt
lager
and
not
an
adjunct
lager
hops
give
only
the
slightest
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
if
this
were
priced
like
a
macro
id
say
this
would
be
a
run
of
the
mill
lawnmower
beer
like
many
others
and
would
pick
this
over
the
3
usual
co
s
choices
just
to
support
an
independent
brewery
however
seeing
as
this
is
priced
at
over
6
per
6pk
ill
either
buy
a
much
better
micro
or
ill
pick
up
a
30pk
of
mhl
when
i
want
a
lawnmower
beer
its
gold
in
color
white
head
skunky
smell
bitter
taste
enough
said
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
nothing
really
good
looking
about
it
there
is
no
complexity
to
the
aroma
it
smells
faintly
of
grains
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
it
taste
along
the
lines
of
grain
however
it
taste
more
of
water
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
overall
drinkability
there
is
no
real
aroma
and
no
real
taste
it
is
kinda
just
blah
not
much
too
it
needs
at
least
some
complexity
d
goes
down
very
easy
i
was
surprised
that
the
taste
was
actually
not
bad
for
an
adjunct
lager
i
could
find
myself
going
for
another
pretty
easily
d
easy
to
drink
nothing
to
it
no
body
or
outstanding
flavors
d
due
to
the
lack
of
bitterness
and
no
complex
flavors
to
explore
this
is
a
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
beer
but
just
not
that
flavorful
to
drink
and
enjoy
dan
old
standby
regional
brew
that
fills
in
the
nostalga
niche
this
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
or
crave
unless
your
from
da
burgh
another
lifeless
example
of
an
american
macro
pils
why
do
people
drink
this
stuff
on
a
regular
basis
give
me
a
quality
pils
hefe
or
helles
if
i
need
something
crisp
and
refreshing
d
okay
to
drink
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
light
flavors
but
isnt
flavor
the
reason
to
drink
in
the
first
place
16oz
bottle
poured
into
bubble
pint
glass
poured
a
bright
clear
yellow
with
about
34
on
an
inch
of
bright
white
head
leaving
just
the
tiniest
possible
amount
of
lacing
a
strong
stale
beer
aroma
was
most
prominent
in
the
nose
slight
skunk
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
otherwise
no
noticeable
flavors
typical
body
for
the
style
typical
drinkability
for
the
style
thats
to
say
you
can
pour
em
back
like
water
except
for
the
aroma
this
would
be
an
acceptable
version
of
the
style
as
it
is
there
are
better
cheap
american
lagers
honestly
this
beer
is
not
very
appealing
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
and
i
would
probably
pass
it
over
if
there
was
just
about
anything
else
on
the
shelf
instead
of
buying
this
i
would
recommend
getting
anyone
of
your
mass
produced
major
beers
that
are
on
the
market
if
you
are
looking
for
just
a
beer
to
drink
and
you
could
get
this
on
sale
okay
but
its
nothing
special
overall
i
was
less
than
impressed
with
this
beer
i
dont
think
its
much
as
far
as
a
beer
goes
but
it
does
seem
to
capture
the
feel
of
the
city
d
the
offflavours
dont
make
for
a
clean
easy
drinking
lager
pass
on
this
one
drinkability
is
ok
because
it
is
not
too
bitter
or
not
to
tasty
this
wasnt
the
worst
adjunct
beer
as
some
people
would
call
it
it
had
an
even
finger
and
a
half
of
white
head
over
a
pale
straw
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
bubbles
there
was
not
much
for
lace
but
what
lace
did
exist
was
pretty
spread
out
it
had
an
average
mass
produced
lager
aroma
slightly
malty
and
hoppy
the
taste
was
metallic
spicy
with
some
grain
and
sour
apple
like
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
even
it
wasnt
a
horrible
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
beer
i
would
go
searching
for
the
taste
has
similar
qualities
definitely
it
has
a
standard
macroadjunct
pale
lager
character
to
it
but
its
slightly
unique
it
tastes
mostly
of
fermented
bread
dough
and
apple
cider
with
some
musty
grain
and
a
hint
of
lemon
in
the
finish
and
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertatse
it
soon
becomes
rather
bland
and
the
feel
is
soft
its
not
bad
is
quite
drinkable
and
better
than
many
but
also
far
from
very
good
it
actually
seems
somewhat
lacking
in
crispness
and
comes
off
a
tad
heavy
for
the
taste
there
are
many
macros
that
i
greatly
prefer
to
this
this
stuff
is
not
so
good
even
pittsburgh
macro
drinkers
tend
to
acknowledge
this
isnt
great
stuff
light
toasted
grain
backbone
with
a
hint
of
vegetables
flavorless
and
boring
overall
a
weird
sugarycream
taste
takes
over
the
palate
best
served
as
cold
as
possible
and
even
then
its
a
stretch
this
beer
continues
to
be
a
staple
of
my
hometown
i
have
found
myself
low
on
cash
of
late
and
i
figured
this
is
a
good
time
to
go
back
to
my
roots
pours
a
true
golden
tone
with
a
highly
carbonated
thin
white
head
everything
about
this
beer
says
its
classic
you
have
to
love
the
old
school
label
the
aroma
is
very
faint
with
some
sweet
corn
notes
hidden
in
there
the
taste
reminds
me
of
the
wilkinsburgpenn
joint
water
used
to
brew
this
beer
the
sweetness
of
corn
and
rice
adjuncts
is
the
backbone
with
some
mild
hop
bitterness
here
to
form
one
great
summertime
lawnmower
beer
not
an
all
grain
beer
but
much
better
than
the
adjunct
ridden
garbage
anhueser
busch
throws
at
us
i
will
definitely
drink
locally
and
think
globally
in
this
situation
a
light
to
medium
body
that
is
true
to
its
american
lager
profile
i
will
always
keep
a
place
in
my
heart
for
this
historic
beer
of
the
city
i
was
born
in
pale
lager
from
steeler
country
had
this
many
times
in
the
past
sampled
a
single
for
old
times
sake
corny
light
scent
light
gold
pour
minimal
white
head
crisp
yet
watery
on
the
palate
typical
swill
taste
blue
collar
beer
for
sure
used
to
be
able
to
get
this
at
one
of
my
college
hang
outs
for
50
cents
a
can
actually
turned
out
to
be
better
than
i
expected
a
step
above
its
mass
produced
peers
nothing
special
or
worth
noting
but
it
has
a
clean
taste
with
some
actual
hop
presence
very
drinkable
imo
with
little
skunky
smell
or
aftertaste
the
aroma
was
a
faint
malt
smell
the
taste
was
big
brewery
lager
not
much
in
the
flavor
category
i
would
of
probably
indulged
in
many
of
these
if
i
would
have
grown
up
around
the
pa
area
not
much
feel
and
overall
that
is
what
you
expect
for
a
1
29
for
a
pint
it
pours
a
transparent
yellow
with
a
decent
looking
foamy
white
head
and
some
visible
rising
carbonation
it
sports
the
classic
macromalt
nose
with
a
citrusy
hop
presence
bonus
its
everything
youd
expect
from
a
crisp
clean
american
lager
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
a
great
choice
if
you
have
to
pick
a
beer
to
drink
all
day
good
balance
great
drinkability
d
quite
honestly
i
can
drink
these
while
tailgating
all
day
it
is
a
beer
that
i
dont
have
to
think
about
md
good
level
or
carbonation
overall
a
less
than
average
beer
and
certainly
one
that
i
will
not
reach
for
often
and
not
one
that
i
would
probably
buy
if
i
saw
it
at
the
beer
store
d
like
most
beers
in
this
style
and
water
very
drinkable
good
to
wash
down
a
big
meal
but
id
rather
not
drink
much
of
this
d
hits
the
spot
and
is
very
refreshing
does
do
the
job
a
macro
sets
out
to
do
better
than
the
macro
styles
we
have
down
here
if
created
a
premium
version
of
the
domestic
macro
noncraft
beers
is
what
theyre
after
then
theyve
achieved
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
with
this
stuff
what
it
lacks
in
appearance
and
smell
does
a
pretty
good
job
in
the
aftertaste
and
feel
in
the
mouth
its
a
good
cheap
pennsylvania
lager
and
goes
well
with
fish
pours
a
very
weak
strawyellow
color
although
there
was
a
little
head
very
little
scent
beyond
a
little
sweet
sugary
matliness
low
taste
too
although
there
was
a
little
bit
of
malt
to
it
it
does
go
down
very
smooth
better
than
its
ic
light
coutnerpart
it
would
make
for
a
quick
refreshing
beer
to
quench
your
thirst
but
not
to
satisfy
the
inner
beer
geek
drinkability
soso
much
to
my
surprise
i
found
i
c
light
to
be
okay
maybe
not
better
but
more
tolerable
overall
a
smooth
american
macro
lager
which
isnt
big
on
taste
but
not
as
watery
or
thin
as
most
of
its
counterparts
likely
will
not
purchase
again
anytime
soon
i
have
never
heard
so
many
requests
for
a
beer
until
we
got
iron
city
into
my
store
i
just
had
to
try
it
i
was
somewhat
impressed
fo
how
dirt
cheap
this
beer
is
pours
a
yellowish
gold
with
a
sickly
head
the
malt
taste
was
speaking
to
me
but
it
was
just
a
whisper
i
could
drink
it
all
day
if
that
was
the
only
think
available
otherwise
i
would
find
something
dark
and
flavorful
d
this
isnt
the
best
lager
but
certainly
inst
the
worst
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
plastic
cup
at
spring
training
home
of
pittsburgh
pirates
in
bradenton
pours
gold
with
minimal
head
grassy
aroma
taste
average
pretty
much
just
tasted
sprizzly
if
that
makes
any
sense
refreshing
enough
for
roasting
in
the
florida
sun
at
the
ballpark
but
will
stick
with
budweiser
for
this
sort
of
scene
going
forward
we
actually
get
this
beer
in
florida
go
figure
pours
a
pale
hazy
yellow
with
no
head
but
a
ring
around
the
entire
drink
very
average
looking
smell
is
bready
and
yeasty
with
some
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
pretty
bland
a
bit
malty
but
over
all
very
carbonated
like
club
soda
you
can
really
hammer
these
down
since
they
dont
really
have
anytype
of
taste
to
them
overall
i
enjoy
somthing
a
bit
my
dynamic
in
my
book
drinkability
below
average
but
not
awful
like
most
macro
lagers
you
can
down
a
lot
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
you
dont
really
want
to
and
i
know
from
prior
encounters
that
this
beer
gives
the
worst
hangover
of
any
macro
lager
ive
ever
had
with
the
exception
of
subprime
beers
like
carling
black
label
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
aromas
of
a
small
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
small
malt
presence
yet
very
watery
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
pilsner
like
aftertaste
not
big
at
all
yet
very
non
offensive
good
for
summer
but
nothing
more
than
ok
look
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
you
have
to
understand
pittsburgh
it
is
the
only
city
w
an
entrance
ride
through
the
liberty
tubes
before
you
enter
the
city
and
youll
know
what
i
mean
but
it
is
not
pretty
sure
it
looks
great
w
the
rivers
and
bridges
on
a
poster
but
real
pittsburgh
is
cold
dirty
and
grimy
and
it
is
a
steel
town
you
work
in
a
mill
all
day
and
you
want
a
beer
that
just
goes
down
smooth
fast
and
is
cheap
i
have
stillmill
workers
in
my
family
or
when
you
want
about
12
beers
to
tailgate
for
a
stillers
game
in
that
regard
ill
always
have
a
spot
for
this
beer
and
will
tell
everyone
to
give
it
one
try
drinkability
good
regional
brew
fits
where
it
comes
from
i
enjoy
this
type
of
beer
to
keep
it
all
in
perspective
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
metallic
with
some
grainy
malt
the
taste
is
your
typical
macro
lager
with
malt
and
very
minimal
hops
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
drinkability
well
i
had
to
travel
for
about
35
minutes
to
pick
this
particular
drink
up
w
a
variety
of
other
drinks
i
also
tried
this
one
i
enjoy
the
least
amount
i
will
not
be
picking
up
another
bottle
of
this
there
are
other
micro
lagers
that
have
better
taste
and
many
more
generic
beers
that
taste
the
same
as
this
i
wanted
to
like
it
i
really
did
because
i
enjoy
lagers
so
much
but
this
one
just
did
nothing
for
me
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
even
though
it
is
a
burg
thing
arrived
with
the
expected
clear
pale
golden
yellow
color
but
disappointingly
devoid
of
any
head
smells
nebulously
grainy
and
virtually
devoid
of
malts
and
all
but
a
slight
note
of
hops
not
much
of
a
nose
at
all
actually
taste
is
merely
ok
in
the
way
that
i
expect
american
macros
to
be
grain
particularly
corn
takes
center
stage
with
again
just
a
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
semidry
helping
this
one
go
down
more
easily
than
it
deserves
i
will
say
thisits
a
fitting
pairing
with
a
primanti
brothers
fried
bologna
and
cheese
sandwich
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
after
all
these
years
id
never
tried
i
even
went
to
college
in
pittsburgh
but
somehow
the
strohs
30pack
was
more
appealing
picked
up
a
case
of
this
a
few
months
ago
and
was
surprised
at
the
price
about
18
poured
ok
decent
golden
color
not
much
foam
though
it
was
the
taste
that
really
got
me
at
first
it
was
like
any
other
macro
but
then
an
odd
sweet
aftertaste
almost
sour
is
that
corn
kicks
in
which
completely
turned
me
off
to
it
its
not
undrinkable
i
actually
got
through
the
case
eventually
but
its
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
d
not
horribly
undrinkable
this
beers
odd
combo
of
flavor
finish
and
carbonation
still
leave
much
to
be
desired
for
the
price
one
could
easily
find
beers
that
are
prettier
tastier
and
more
drinkable
well
this
beer
is
what
it
is
a
massproduced
chugging
beer
cant
say
i
really
can
recommend
it
though
a
decent
macro
lager
typical
adjunct
filled
lager
decent
appearance
and
adjunct
smell
taste
is
typical
macro
lager
crap
mouthfeel
is
fairly
crisp
but
dry
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
so
are
all
macro
lagers
if
you
can
drink
them
cold
and
not
taste
the
adjunct
crap
going
on
not
a
beer
id
turn
down
but
not
a
beer
id
order
for
myself
try
it
if
it
comes
by
you
cheap
otherwise
dont
waste
your
time
didnt
expect
much
from
this
one
pretty
much
your
standard
american
macro
lager
there
really
is
no
difference
between
this
one
an
others
of
the
same
style
its
all
personal
preference
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
anytime
soon
but
i
would
try
a
iron
city
ipa
if
they
made
one
beyond
the
surprisingly
crisp
hoppiness
iron
city
is
a
fairly
runofthemill
macro
lager
clean
and
light
refreshing
and
hydrating
at
best
nothing
objectionable
nothing
tasty
i
would
definitely
take
one
if
offered
but
dont
think
ill
be
needing
to
buy
another
from
the
store
not
good
at
all
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
aluminum
bottle
opinion
this
beer
really
isnt
too
bad
when
you
put
it
beside
so
many
others
in
this
category
there
is
a
malt
flavor
here
and
yes
i
said
flavor
of
course
i
like
my
beer
with
a
bit
more
flavor
but
this
beer
still
isnt
too
bad
and
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
had
it
to
pick
over
any
of
the
budmilloors
inoffensive
when
cold
this
beeer
is
definately
no
great
shakes
when
it
warms
up
this
sample
is
from
a
12
ounce
aluminum
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
which
goes
away
pretty
fast
it
smells
like
grain
adjuncts
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
it
tastes
like
most
macro
lagers
but
iron
city
does
have
a
little
bit
of
an
overall
sweeter
taste
and
the
taste
is
nonoffensive
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
drinkability
is
ok
it
is
easy
to
drink
for
the
most
part
its
a
typical
macro
lager
but
its
not
bad
imo
it
does
taste
a
little
better
when
watching
the
pirates
at
pnc
park
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
poured
a
light
yellow
and
had
a
medium
head
the
smell
had
a
faint
hop
aroma
and
a
bit
of
malt
too
the
taste
was
light
with
a
lightmedium
body
there
is
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavor
present
here
but
not
a
whole
lot
the
taste
isnt
too
bad
theres
just
not
a
whole
lot
of
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
medium
carbonation
this
isnt
a
real
heavy
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
a
bad
taste
i
consider
to
be
pretty
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
it
in
true
pittsburgher
fashion
with
a
primanti
brothers
sandwich
definately
worth
a
try
and
a
must
when
visiting
the
great
city
of
pittsburgh
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
color
forming
a
12
inch
fluffy
white
head
leaving
medium
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
light
hops
giving
it
a
slight
citrus
smell
the
taste
is
nothing
great
but
a
little
better
than
bud
or
miller
not
much
here
a
little
grain
and
a
little
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
i
could
see
how
light
drinkers
would
enjoy
this
but
this
really
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
mouthfeel
was
highly
carbonated
and
mediumthin
bodied
fizzy
action
when
held
in
the
mouth
notes
no
thanks
pbr
takes
this
behind
the
shed
and
kicks
its
ass
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
tastes
good
with
food
and
i
find
it
to
be
very
refreshing
im
worried
about
the
brewery
and
hope
that
the
bankrupcy
judge
doesnt
pull
the
plug
on
them
good
luck
to
all
that
work
there
i
kinda
enjoy
ic
as
far
as
macrolagers
go
its
pretty
good
beats
bmc
anyways
pick
one
up
yins
might
like
it
overall
i
dont
get
any
offflavors
or
cheap
flavors
to
it
maybe
a
little
heavy
on
the
adjunct
sweetness
but
its
ok
id
order
a
pitcher
if
i
was
in
pittsburgh
as
it
warms
it
does
get
a
little
harsher
tasting
a
few
signs
of
life
in
the
taste
but
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
watery
i
guess
i
could
mow
with
it
if
i
had
to
this
is
a
better
beer
than
i
expected
the
color
is
light
yellow
and
there
is
ample
carbonation
the
smell
is
grainy
but
the
taste
is
more
than
is
expected
of
the
style
the
beer
does
not
have
that
grainy
harshness
that
is
typical
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
inviting
this
is
a
session
beer
is
i
have
ever
seen
one
this
beer
is
better
than
any
macro
i
have
had
top
of
the
heap
in
that
style
thnks
to
wcudwight
for
the
bottle
this
was
my
first
aluminum
bottle
ahhh
you
know
youre
in
pittsburgh
when
you
have
a
bottle
of
iron
city
in
your
hand
although
i
cant
say
that
i
enjoy
iron
citybasically
just
a
super
fizzy
bland
lageri
would
encourage
anyone
that
visits
the
burgh
to
have
one
this
is
truly
a
steel
town
staple
iron
city
is
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
head
did
not
last
long
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
sort
of
grainy
its
taste
is
also
on
the
sweet
side
mainly
grainy
and
boring
it
is
light
bodied
and
fairly
thirst
quenching
if
you
can
tollerate
the
offtaste
best
macro
lager
ive
had
yet
overall
an
overly
sweet
macro
not
recommended
poured
a
clear
pale
goldenrod
with
pretty
much
no
head
and
a
bunch
of
fat
carbonation
rising
for
a
minute
or
so
smell
is
a
thin
mix
of
light
barleystraw
and
a
tinge
of
adjunt
aroma
taste
is
also
kind
of
thin
some
light
straw
maltiness
very
light
spicy
hop
mouthfeel
is
watery
it
is
a
drinkable
brew
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
iron
city
beer
pours
a
typical
macro
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
it
doesnt
smell
particularly
good
mild
vegetable
aromas
are
present
hmm
not
quite
what
i
expected
taste
wise
some
diacetyl
and
some
vegetable
flavor
not
particularly
good
not
particularly
bad
for
the
style
12
oz
glass
bottle
not
their
fancy
aluminum
bottle
the
bottle
just
had
a
simple
red
iron
city
logo
on
the
front
and
the
govt
warning
on
the
back
the
bottle
cap
had
a
nice
old
picture
of
what
the
brewery
looked
like
in
1861
the
bottom
of
the
six
pack
box
had
an
old
type
of
picture
of
a
man
talking
to
his
friends
on
how
pittsburgh
brewing
co
recycles
i
wanted
to
try
this
beer
and
i
actually
found
a
place
that
was
selling
it
really
cheap
it
was
only
4
for
a
six
pack
i
dont
have
much
to
lose
if
it
only
costs
4six
pack
when
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
the
beer
was
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
actually
a
nice
1
finger
head
of
white
foam
i
didnt
think
this
would
have
much
foam
let
alone
a
nice
white
1
finger
it
receded
away
very
nicly
leaving
behind
plenty
of
white
lace
i
felt
that
the
aroma
was
nonoffensive
by
having
an
aroma
of
swwet
grains
and
maybe
a
pinch
of
sweet
malt
in
the
background
i
thought
the
taste
was
complex
but
not
the
complex
taste
you
would
look
for
in
a
beer
the
taste
was
complex
in
grains
like
corn
and
rice
and
ended
with
a
slight
taste
of
sweet
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
with
an
aftertaste
of
sweet
grains
really
nothing
special
except
for
it
was
a
nice
decent
cheap
beer
that
would
be
good
after
working
outside
in
hot
weather
or
maybe
watching
some
pittsburgh
sports
for
years
iron
city
was
the
stock
beer
at
pittsburgh
pirate
baseball
games
and
through
that
advertising
and
promotion
it
probably
gained
its
foothold
in
the
city
thank
god
that
the
new
stadium
now
offers
penn
brewery
stock
instead
this
poured
like
almost
every
macro
on
the
planet
yellow
with
some
uninspired
head
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
sickly
sweet
and
has
some
rotten
cabbage
notes
to
it
this
brew
doesnt
have
much
of
a
flavor
to
it
very
watery
and
no
aftertaste
i
suppose
that
isnt
really
a
bad
thing
if
your
sole
aim
is
intoxication
its
unoffensive
going
down
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
character
and
flavor
which
makes
this
one
very
disappointing
pours
a
straw
gold
with
a
white
head
not
to
much
smell
going
on
similar
to
your
run
of
the
mill
macro
taste
is
similar
watered
down
with
no
huge
flavors
just
an
average
offering
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
decent
carbonation
it
is
a
balanced
beer
but
lacks
flavor
you
could
drink
these
all
day
if
you
are
looking
for
the
average
beer
and
want
a
taste
of
pittsburgh
compared
to
the
macros
it
isnt
the
best
but
also
not
the
worst
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
watery
thin
the
flavor
is
one
dimensional
there
is
not
enough
distinction
between
maltyness
or
hops
the
beer
is
drinkable
enough
while
it
is
cold
i
think
this
would
be
dam
near
undrinkable
with
any
degree
of
warmth
on
it
this
beer
should
be
served
blazing
cold
and
drank
fast
i
think
this
is
a
decent
lager
and
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
this
ones
smooth
and
crisp
and
indicative
of
the
style
too
bad
most
massproduced
american
lagers
arent
like
this
one
definitely
worth
the
purchase
i
had
to
try
it
at
least
once
now
i
have
pours
pale
gold
with
slight
haze
fizzy
onefinger
head
shows
very
poor
retention
and
absolutely
no
lacing
clean
nose
very
mild
adjunct
scent
and
slightest
hint
of
hops
ester
aroma
as
it
warms
taste
is
simple
and
unpleasent
adjunct
and
apple
ester
sweet
aftertaste
is
almost
dry
with
a
estery
sweet
slickness
that
seems
innappropriate
to
the
style
more
like
a
light
malt
liquor
this
has
very
few
redeeming
qualities
low
carbonation
in
a
light
body
deoes
not
help
mouthfeel
or
drinkability
and
the
only
character
present
in
the
finish
are
offflavors
if
you
want
to
get
cheap
drunk
buy
malt
liquor
if
you
want
cheap
session
beer
get
light
lager
this
falls
somewhere
inbetween
and
the
overall
presentation
makes
no
sense
being
from
the
burgh
i
grabbed
a
case
for
old
times
sake
just
for
the
super
bowl
i
dont
drink
macros
much
anymore
unless
in
a
pinch
so
this
was
my
first
in
about
6
months
we
used
to
drink
this
swill
with
a
shot
of
grain
alcohol
thrown
in
the
bottle
in
college
howd
we
do
that
anyway
light
golden
color
lotsa
carbonation
rising
grainy
corny
ricey
nose
and
a
hint
of
lemony
light
hops
after
a
couple
i
found
myself
kinda
liking
it
as
it
brought
back
steel
curtain
memories
from
1979
then
it
brought
back
another
memory
the
following
morning
now
i
remember
why
i
dont
drink
this
shit
anymore
but
it
served
its
purpose
in
its
day
clear
light
gold
colour
the
white
head
poured
with
lots
of
large
fizzy
bubbles
but
these
disappeared
almost
as
fast
as
they
appeared
crisp
malt
nose
faint
spicy
hops
mild
vegetal
aroma
as
well
same
characters
in
the
flavour
along
with
very
mild
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
cider
finishes
sweet
and
offdry
some
acidity
as
well
high
carbonation
and
light
body
it
didnt
quite
work
for
me
some
folks
at
the
party
were
drinking
it
and
enjoying
the
fact
that
it
was
a
pittsburgh
brew
drinkability
is
low
i
just
wasnt
impressed
with
this
brew
ive
had
it
before
but
that
was
with
a
garbage
plate
and
i
remember
being
better
at
that
time
anyhow
i
will
not
endorse
this
as
a
good
brew
d
not
good
i
will
never
have
this
again
more
flavor
here
than
a
typical
macro
but
more
isnt
always
a
good
thing
i
could
session
it
but
id
take
something
cheaper
and
more
readily
available
over
it
natty
boh
anyone
it
would
go
with
food
as
a
typical
macro
this
is
one
of
the
least
drinkable
macros
i
can
recall
having
to
me
this
is
just
like
any
other
macro
but
with
a
better
appearance
and
a
lot
better
taste
i
can
see
myself
buying
again
as
a
session
brew
pours
golden
not
much
head
retentionor
lace
smell
was
light
but
sweet
mouthfeel
was
light
and
carbonated
this
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
sour
edge
to
it
sournot
bitter
its
not
awful
i
would
put
it
in
the
same
catagory
as
pabst
schmidtsand
the
like
reviewed
this
during
the
pittsburghdenver
afc
championship
game
we
had
a
party
here
and
provided
rolling
rock
ic
ic
light
and
penn
pilsner
i
drank
all
of
the
iron
city
beer
not
reviewed
properly
but
this
was
definitely
a
tasty
beer
it
is
much
better
than
miller
lite
or
anything
similar
to
this
not
my
typical
beer
to
drink
a
daily
basis
but
during
a
sporting
event
does
very
well
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
that
live
in
kentucky
im
not
saying
this
because
it
is
a
local
fav
im
saying
this
bc
its
the
truth
this
beer
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
was
one
of
the
first
beers
to
come
in
a
aluminium
bottle
i
tried
the
beer
at
a
restraunt
that
served
pizza
and
it
went
well
with
a
good
meat
me
pizza
i
cant
really
describe
the
color
of
it
cuz
it
was
still
in
the
bottle
but
the
smell
and
taste
in
my
opinion
was
way
better
than
any
bud
coors
or
miller
brands
which
i
know
to
a
lot
of
ppl
doesnt
mean
shit
but
to
some
ppl
that
means
a
lot
i
would
recommend
trying
one
d
slightly
better
than
most
macrosand
alluminum
bottles
ftw
iron
city
beer
pours
nicely
and
generated
an
enormous
amount
of
head
a
surprisingly
pleasant
pale
amber
color
appeared
as
the
head
slowly
gave
way
to
liquid
the
surface
tension
of
the
head
was
stout
and
held
the
pull
tab
for
a
period
of
time
there
was
an
overabundance
of
carbonation
present
my
nose
felt
as
if
it
was
getting
rained
on
as
i
brought
the
glass
up
for
a
drink
this
is
what
really
made
terry
bradshaw
go
bald
12
ounce
aluminum
canbottle
iron
city
beer
pours
out
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
fades
to
nothing
lots
of
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
is
a
sharp
sour
cooked
vegetable
aroma
that
is
not
at
all
pleasant
starts
off
with
a
grain
flavor
that
isnt
bad
but
a
nasty
cooked
vegetable
flavor
comes
in
at
the
middle
this
is
one
of
those
drink
it
fast
before
you
taste
it
beers
i
saw
this
beer
on
a
shelf
of
singles
at
the
store
and
bought
it
because
the
bottle
looked
unique
which
is
a
pretty
stupid
reason
i
guess
i
got
what
i
deserved
sinkability

this
beer
sucks
overall
i
wouldnt
buy
it
which
i
dont
chugging
it
merrily
when
my
buddy
brings
it
from
pittsburg
aluminium
bottle
poured
a
pale
yellow
lager
with
a
medium
white
bubbly
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
corn
is
clearly
noticeable
and
very
little
else
seems
to
pop
out
taste
is
refreshing
with
some
malt
presence
and
crisper
hops
then
expected
just
above
your
average
pale
lager
anyways
i
dont
feel
the
least
bit
guilty
throwing
this
in
the
macro
category
after
all
it
smells
and
tastes
like
a
macro
tons
of
carbonation
this
stuff
is
the
definition
of
a
lawnmower
beer
light
mouthfeel
crisp
finish
final
verdict
a
macro
in
disguise
you
can
save
your
time
and
skip
this
one
i
buy
this
beer
in
mcallen
tx
area
and
i
was
fascinated
about
his
design
very
collectable
a
real
beer
from
the
area
of
the
american
birthplace
of
beer
the
northeast
of
usa
i
think
so
much
about
his
bottle
of
aluminum
what
keeps
his
flavor
not
so
rich
but
had
drinkability
and
his
flavor
is
much
better
with
a
lemmon
touch
the
beer
pours
from
the
355ml
aluminum
bottle
can
a
clear
gold
with
a
smallish
bright
white
head
that
is
semicreamy
in
texture
with
the
left
over
lace
a
fine
film
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is
the
prototypical
malt
lager
with
a
fresh
crisp
sweetness
start
is
lightly
sweet
and
nicely
malted
top
is
light
in
feel
finish
is
strongly
acidic
the
hops
light
but
pleasant
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
lingering
a
drinkable
lager
as
lagers
go
d
unoffensive
im
sure
frat
boys
pound
them
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
1
of
white
head
above
the
clear
straw
brew
head
lasts
reasonably
well
for
the
style
settling
to
about
18
while
i
was
off
answering
the
phone
and
calming
my
daughter
for
5
minutes
lacing
is
spotty
but
still
not
horrible
for
the
style
aroma
is
sweet
adjucty
heaven
or
hell
depending
on
your
viewpoint
i
guess
taste
is
starts
with
slight
adjunct
sweet
as
indicated
by
the
nose
a
light
citrus
hops
bite
int
he
middle
and
closes
plainly
mouthfeel
is
really
watery
and
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
meld
all
that
well
although
drinkability
on
this
one
assuming
you
are
down
with
the
flavor
is
probably
quite
high
very
pale
very
clear
very
bland
for
alot
of
bubbles
fizzing
up
their
is
no
head
none
just
a
light
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
outside
the
best
looking
thing
about
this
beer
is
well
the
aluminum
bottle
scent
is
clean
with
a
bit
of
cooked
vegetables
and
grass
not
much
else
tase
is
very
astringent
light
bit
of
a
lemon
hop
taste
and
very
faint
malts
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
astringent
pretty
much
substandard
swill
but
it
cost
75
cents
a
bottle
gold
on
colour
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
fast
head
some
malty
aromas
to
this
one
along
with
a
touch
of
corn
fairly
malty
in
flavor
as
well
with
some
faint
notes
of
caramel
and
earthy
hops
its
basically
a
halfstep
up
from
your
typical
north
american
macro
but
nothing
worth
celebrating
cool
aluminum
bottle
though
eh
better
than
a
macro
offering
or
just
more
of
the
same
medium
bodied
but
nicely
carbonated
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
this
one
is
more
of
a
one
trick
poney
that
is
decidedly
sweet
and
grainy
in
the
malt
areas
o
tries
to
make
its
way
through
towards
the
swallow
bitterness
comes
along
at
the
end
leaving
the
tongue
slightly
dry
the
slick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
leaves
it
slightly
better
than
average
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
as
i
have
been
told
by
others
actually
a
rather
drinkable
cheap
lager
poured
out
to
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
no
lace
in
the
glass
odors
of
corn
malt
and
a
sweet
character
was
noted
flavor
was
your
typical
lager
not
amazing
but
not
terrible
either
this
beer
was
nothing
special
flavors
of
corn
and
some
malt
and
hops
finished
crisp
and
clean
not
an
offensive
beer
but
not
an
amazing
one
either
worth
a
try
and
recommended
for
lager
fans
drinkability
lines
right
up
there
with
most
of
the
macro
brews
not
horrible
but
may
take
this
over
bm
or
c
slightly
malty
nose
slightly
malty
taste
pretty
much
unmemorable
without
being
offensive
yawn
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
highly
carbonated
i
drank
one
and
did
not
want
another
that
is
why
i
rated
the
drinkability
on
the
low
side
not
horrible
but
not
for
me
good
stuff
to
wash
your
teeth
with
watching
a
live
sports
event
but
youd
have
to
be
a
real
tar
to
actually
buy
it
to
enjoy
at
a
pub
or
at
home
i
couldnt
believe
how
clear
this
stuff
poured
the
most
hollow
gold
i
ever
saw
head
just
up
and
left
quickly
very
mild
scented
also
the
above
average
taste
of
maltgrain
with
a
slight
hop
finish
really
surprised
me
after
seeing
how
it
looked
the
alumabottle
is
cool
too
not
great
but
certainly
not
bad
at
all
way
too
sweetdextrose
makes
plain
lager
drinkable
though
artificial
candy
aroma
appropriately
carbonated
thin
mouthfeel
not
worth
finishing
bottle
or
quality
ingrediants
to
cook
with
rare
drain
pourout
like
the
aluminum
bottle
will
bounce
inexpensive
had
to
try
this
due
to
the
novel
silver
bottle
that
looks
like
something
out
of
a
scifi
film
unfortunately
the
bottle
design
is
where
the
interesting
characteristics
of
this
beer
end
it
pours
a
clear
yellow
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
lace
the
nose
has
some
sweetness
but
there
is
also
a
noticeable
aroma
of
stale
grains
and
a
bit
of
cooked
corn
the
taste
begins
with
a
light
sweetness
but
the
flavors
are
quite
thin
a
touch
of
hops
are
detectable
towards
the
end
but
again
the
flavors
are
all
very
faint
a
step
up
from
the
macros
i
suppose
but
not
by
much
drinkability
for
a
macro
lager
it
has
no
bad
aftertaste
it
is
slightly
off
balance
but
overall
it
is
decent
it
makes
an
alright
beer
for
something
like
washing
down
pizza
or
quenching
thirst
something
to
drink
when
you
dont
have
to
think
about
the
beer
my
first
and
last
iron
city
beer
mouthfeel
was
quite
thin
and
watery
somewhat
bland
drinkability
is
ok
overall
for
a
macro
actually
since
i
had
chili
for
dinner
i
can
see
how
it
would
go
somewhat
well
with
something
spicy
pours
a
translucent
golden
hue
that
has
the
slightest
flourish
of
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
immediately
a
touch
of
carbonation
continues
to
rise
from
the
bottom
for
a
while
an
almost
candyish
sweet
aroma
is
immediately
noticeable
dominateed
by
adjunct
grain
very
low
on
flavor
more
adjunct
malt
with
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
developing
into
an
almost
mediciney
astringency
towards
the
finish
body
is
thin
even
for
a
macro
lager
i
guess
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
the
stuff
if
you
wanted
to
not
terrible
or
anything
just
not
good
ok
back
to
woodys
soapbox
so
it
wasnt
any
great
shakes
so
what
does
it
invoke
memories
of
sitting
with
my
departed
pops
as
a
kid
watching
bucs
and
stillers
games
hell
yeah
will
it
remain
my
lawnmower
beer
of
choice
until
heaven
forbid
pgh
bc
closes
its
doors
or
is
bought
out
hell
yeah
will
i
continue
to
bring
cases
sixes
40s
et
al
to
tailgates
hell
yeah
a
small
fast
fizzy
level
white
head
dies
to
a
film
quickly
the
beer
is
ultra
clear
pale
gold
with
impatient
carbonation
smell
is
sweettart
like
apple
juice
with
some
nuts
and
sugar
the
beer
starts
fruity
and
a
little
bitter
then
turns
sweet
with
more
apple
juice
and
a
fairly
solid
body
the
finish
gives
major
nuts
and
nicely
fresh
bitterness
it
gets
a
little
chemically
at
temperature
but
overall
its
not
bad
some
pleasant
flavors
in
there

thanks

the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
lager
yeast
aroma
i
guess
there
are
adjuncts
present
but
it
seems
maltier
than
most
macros
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
crisp
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
clean
it
has
good
flavor
for
a
macro
lager
its
not
at
all
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
lager
everyone
always
jokes
about
this
beer
but
i
like
it
its
a
good
drinker
adjunct
adjunct
adjunct
i
had
this
once
and
i
wont
buy
it
no
more
i
got
caught
by
the
name
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
local
micro
yes
it
was
a
local
brewery
but
the
product
is
very
typical
of
macros
have
a
bud
or
this
one
and
you
wont
see
much
difference
it
is
just
another
yellow
fizzy
and
corny
beer
thats
all
about
it
presentation
packaged
in
an
aluminum
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
the
mouthfeel
provided
a
nice
bubbly
carbonation
as
it
passed
the
tongue
but
besides
that
i
found
this
beer
average
overall
impression
easy
drinking
uninspiring
i
see
this
as
a
beer
for
the
masses
id
choose
one
over
any
bmc
product
and
could
see
some
enjoying
a
session
of
this
but
overall
its
a
fairly
bland
lager
thanks
to
fellow
ba
mtanji
for
this
sample
poured
a
light
amber
color
typical
of
this
style
of
beer
not
much
smell
to
speak
of
taste
is
not
much
of
anything
mouth
feel
is
as
of
water
drinkablility
is
that
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
without
tasting
what
you
drink
this
is
your
beer
its
like
a
beer
only
instead
of
hops
they
used
garbage
instead
of
malt
they
used
garbage
and
instead
of
water
they
used
garbage
water
the
best
thing
i
can
say
is
that
the
ic
light
is
way
better
than
the
regular
probably
because
the
nasty
taste
is
more
watered
down
overall
if
im
going
to
drink
a
crappy
beer
ill
stick
to
budweiser
12
oz
aluminum
bottle
served
chilled
in
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
clear
orangeyellow
with
a
1
finger
head
that
dissolves
to
almost
nothing
and
leaves
very
few
spots
of
lace
smell
is
very
crisp
with
cooked
veggies
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
behind
it
taste
is
about
the
same
nothing
special
it
is
very
simple
but
probably
easy
to
drink
a
whole
bunch
pale
gold
in
hue
clear
no
animation
the
liquid
looks
limp
the
head
was
white
in
color
but
surprisingly
frothy
even
though
it
was
only
a
half
finger
in
height
at
its
highest
point
head
retention
was
fair
it
faded
quickly
to
a
soapy
cap
more
naked
spots
then
foam
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
the
appearance
is
average
my
first
sniff
said
corn

it
is
cold
enough
that
i
smell
little
else
the
aroma
is
obviously
simplistic
but
not
offensive
at
its
present
state
still
it
is
hardly
inviting
once
warmer
it
smells
like
husk
and
dog
food
that
isnt
good
i
guess
that
is
why
they
make
the
bottle
so
snazzy
if
you
drink
it
straight
from
the
aluminum
chamber
you
cant
smell
it
and
as
such
you
cant
taste
it
that
might
be
the
goal
of
most
beer
drinkers
not
me
though
well
the
palate
is
not
awful
it
is
sweet
and
corny
like
a
busch
i
cant
see
much
of
a
difference
actually
hop
bitterness
is
minimal
hop
flavor
is
none
maltiness
youre
joking
right
i
cant
taste
any
it
is
tolerable
when
cold
however
as
it
warms
it
turns
sloppy
like
wet
grain
husk
and
stale
water
with
a
sweet
empty
finish
ive
heard
horror
stories
about
this
beer
from
swill
drinkers
but
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
that
bad
could
i
set
down
and
drink
a
sixpack
i
wouldnt
want
too
and
since
i
only
have
one
bottle
i
dont
have
too
medium
in
body
modest
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
very
solid
and
it
saves
this
beer
from
being
too
watery
or
too
sweet
there
is
an
odd
lemony
aftertaste
on
the
whole
this
beer
for
an
adjunct
lager
is
okay
should
pittsburgh
be
proud
of
this
beer
no
ashamed
well
its
not
much
cup
of
beer
i
think
you
need
some
nostalgia
to
like
it
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
kansas
city
ks
for
around
a
1
50
this
was
a
onetime
thing
for
me
metal
bottle
version
pours
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
tiny
bubbles
and
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
sweet
but
nondistinct
lightbodied
and
actually
has
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
and
corn
flavor
at
least
there
is
nothing
offensive
going
on
the
finish
is
short
and
almost
flavorless
aside
from
a
bit
of
grain
and
malt
of
the
macro
lager
type
beers
this
is
one
of
the
better
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
for
this
beer
so
i
wasnt
to
disapointed
when
i
tryed
it
the
name
says
it
all
hints
of
metal
couldnt
help
but
think
it
was
chewing
up
my
belly
there
was
a
high
alcohol
content
if
thats
what
your
going
for
then
thats
the
beers
high
point
cheap
bad
beer
this
is
par
for
the
coarse
d
well
hmmm
it
goes
down
ok
but
again
just
a
weird
off
flavor
maybe
its
the
metal
bottle
appearance
was
a
clear
lemon
yellow
with
a
small
head
which
left
a
slight
foam
ring
malt
smell
and
lemon
sourness
taste
was
sour
with
a
hay
or
straw
quality
and
a
bit
of
doughiness
mouthfeel
was
light
not
much
else
to
say
not
a
bad
beer
to
kick
around
on
a
summer
afternoon
if
there
was
nothing
else
around
had
this
at
a
kegger
its
just
awful
awful
awful
just
a
bubbly
urinecolored
mess
through
a
clear
plastic
cup
smells
like
it
tastes
it
feels
like
a
highacid
grain
punch
no
thicker
than
water
in
the
mouth
i
know
this
is
the
stuff
that
goes
around
at
these
kinds
of
parties
but
its
worse
than
natty
beast
american
even
olde
english
for
crying
out
loud
i
would
personally
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
worse
beer
cool
12
oz
aluminum
bottle
that
pours
a
clear
straw
golden
with
a
decent
fizzy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
does
leaves
some
lacing
light
grainy
and
flowery
aromas
no
skunk
sweet
bready
grassy
and
grainy
flavors
light
bodied
with
a
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
with
some
sweetness
alright
for
what
it
is
19
99
case
aluminum
bottles
i
finished
it
almost
this
wasnt
my
first
iron
city
i
had
one
at
primanti
bros
on
a
road
trip
almost
ruined
the
sandwich
this
reminds
me
very
much
of
the
hudhepohl
we
used
to
drink
in
college
nasty
stuff
what
was
i
thinking
oh
yeah
the
aluminum
bottle
had
to
try
the
aluminum
bottle
yellowamber
color
and
weak
head
aroma
is
very
much
like
white
grape
juice
flavor
is
sweet
corn
adjunct
and
little
malt
or
hops
to
speak
of
finishes
dry
and
astringent
a
waste
of
time
and
money
i
am
going
to
save
the
aluminum
bottleit
can
be
recapped
i
will
put
one
of
my
homebrewed
ipas
in
it
to
get
a
real
read
on
what
it
does
to
good
beer
12
oz
aluminum
bottle
obtained
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
in
january
2005
and
consumed
that
same
evening
pours
a
halffinger
white
head
that
very
quickly
settled
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
crystal
clear
light
honey
color
with
a
few
streams
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
smells
mildly
sweet
honeylike
with
faint
hop
saaz
or
perhaps
thats
just
metal
from
the
bottle
and
maybe
a
bit
of
orange
tastes
weakly
malt
sweet
with
hop
bittera
bit
to
strong
for
the
limited
sweetness
a
metalic
flavor
im
hoping
is
from
the
hops
is
present
from
start
to
finish
fruity
flavors
consist
of
cantelope
which
i
think
is
correctly
called
muskmelon
and
a
bit
of
peach
a
sour
carbonation
fizz
persists
on
my
tongue
after
the
swallow
thin
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
much
better
than
i
expected
i
was
expecting
macroswill
but
the
fruit
flavors
are
a
bit
stronger
than
i
expect
in
a
lager
enjoyable
went
down
quick
on
to
the
next
beer
for
the
evening
the
can
had
a
cool
retro
look
made
me
wonder
if
it
was
good
marketing
or
just
a
holdover
from
years
ago
the
beer
poured
a
golden
color
deeper
than
those
massproduced
beers
with
a
decent
creamy
white
head
the
smell
was
that
typical
american
lager
smell
that
i
just
cant
seem
to
elaborate
on
as
for
the
taste
it
was
surprisingly
somewhat
tasty
mildly
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
mild
hop
flavor
but
no
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
there
was
none
of
that
metallic
flavor
that
always
seems
present
in
canned
beers
this
one
was
apparently
relatively
fresh
it
was
a
much
more
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
than
i
expected
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
find
yourself
at
a
steelers
game
this
is
not
a
bad
regional
and
i
would
choose
it
over
a
bmc
product
anytime
it
reminds
me
of
grain
belt
or
a
leines
i
admit
it
i
bought
this
because
i
wanted
to
try
the
new
alluminum
bottle
poured
a
medium
straw
color
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
hang
around
and
almost
non
existant
lace
smells
of
sweet
malt
with
corn
and
rice
very
evedent
almost
buttered
popcorn
like
taste
is
that
of
sweet
malt
again
with
corn
and
rice
very
evident
very
watery
even
for
an
adjuct
macro
this
one
needs
help
the
only
thing
this
one
has
going
for
it
is
the
bottle
the
only
way
i
would
ever
drink
this
again
is
if
someone
gave
one
to
me
well
being
from
western
pa
i
had
to
try
iron
city
in
its
new
aluminum
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
fled
the
scene
quickly
the
smell
was
somewhat
sweet
but
not
all
that
great
the
taste
was
sweet
yet
a
touch
bitter
maybe
even
sour
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
wasnt
too
horrible
either
i
could
not
picture
myself
drinking
this
ever
again
i
have
been
caught
drinking
worse
much
worse
i
got
this
beer
because
of
the
cool
looking
aluminum
bottle
when
i
was
at
a
hole
in
the
wall
middle
eastern
eatery
it
really
wasnt
worth
trying
at
all
not
much
flavor
except
for
adjuncts
and
they
seemed
to
really
get
in
the
way
of
everything
it
wasnt
even
thirst
quenching
because
it
was
so
adjunct
heavy
not
smooth
in
the
least
and
i
didnt
drink
it
fast
which
meant
that
it
warmed
and
that
was
not
a
good
thing
maybe
get
it
for
the
bottle
because
it
was
kinda
a
cool
thing
but
dont
think
about
getting
this
for
any
other
reason

a
white

the
water
seems
to
change
the
beer
the
aforementioned
rolling
rock
changed
when
it
went
away
from
latrobe
ic
changed
to
be
a
low
end
but
acceptable
lager
its
beaten
bmc
and
id
say
it
might
be
a
little
lower
than
pbr
but
still
not
bad
at
all

a
standard
american
lager
not
much
character
drinkable
but
nothing
special
pretty
boring
could
aluminum
bottles
be
the
wave
of
the
future
i
bought
this
bottle
of
iron
city
beer
because
of
nostalgia
even
though
i
dont
believe
ive
ever
had
it
before
i
remember
hearing
about
it
and
seeing
it
on
the
shelves
during
my
youth
in
ohio
well
my
curiosity
was
satisfied
what
is
it
that
they
say
about
curiosity
and
the
cat
paid
3
99
for
a
6pk
a
clear
yellowgold
body
reveals
averagesized
bubbles
rising
quickly
beneath
a
short
but
frothy
head
of
bright
white
foam
the
retention
is
as
might
be
expected
and
it
drops
readily
to
a
wide
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
the
nose
offers
some
sweet
lightly
grainy
malt
with
a
light
hint
of
floral
hops
mixed
in
the
body
is
medium
and
its
lightly
crisp
in
the
mouth
sweet
lightly
grainy
malt
dominates
the
flavor
although
the
same
hint
of
hops
found
in
the
nose
also
tries
to
make
its
way
through
towards
the
swallow
bitterness
is
kept
at
a
minimum
but
theres
just
enough
there
to
balance
it
and
it
finishes
drying
with
a
note
of
malt
whos
sweetness
fades
although
its
graininess
lingers
average
all
in
all
its
nothing
spectacular
but
its
welcome
on
this
day
pale
golden
hue
tiny
strings
of
carbonation
your
macrotypical
nose
offerings
in
the
way
of
husky
grain
and
the
much
desired
cooked
veggies
up
front
rather
weak
bodied
some
light
hop
detection
corn
and
husky
flavorings
watery
and
metallic
in
the
body
worsens
as
it
warms
dont
hurt
yourself
searching
for
this
one
i
figured
since
i
was
in
pittsburgh
well
west
virginia
really
id
drink
what
the
locals
drank
ive
had
thuse
brew
before
and
been
underwhelmed
and
was
once
again
though
less
so
than
before
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
virtually
no
head
typical
macro
smells
and
tastes
here
low
on
hop
malt
and
grain
characteristics
high
on
corn
and
watery
ones
not
as
bad
as
a
macro
but
not
much
better
would
i
get
it
again
sure
because
unless
your
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
ive
found
that
its
hard
to
come
across
anything
else
but
the
macros
and
maybe
a
heineken
here
and
there
in
that
area
of
the
country
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
this
is
simply
cheap
beer
that
is
drinkable
that
is
all
the
beer
is
pretty
much
water
and
filleralot
of
that
corn
flavor
thing
going
on
if
i
was
a
broke
factory
worker
in
need
of
some
decent
refreshment
after
a
long
hard
day
i
could
find
some
semblance
of
comfort
in
an
iron
city
a
decent
mass
produced
softie
that
will
whet
your
whistle
and
leave
your
wallet
be
that
is
all
this
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
in
color
with
little
aroma
its
typical
for
a
light
beer
such
as
bud
light
but
had
a
little
more
color
to
it
it
went
down
rather
smooth
much
like
water
i
drank
this
beer
because
it
was
the
only
option
at
a
church
picnic
in
pa
probably
would
not
have
had
it
otherwise
and
probably
wont
have
it
again
iron
city
this
beer
apparently
bought
on
a
lark
was
not
as
big
a
disappointment
as
i
had
expected
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
although
it
had
a
lot
more
color
than
a
bud
the
aroma
was
fairly
weak
and
predominately
adjuncts
the
beer
as
is
absolutely
typical
for
the
style
was
perfectly
clear
the
taste
was
surprising
smooth
for
an
american
style
macro
on
the
other
hand
the
corn
taste
overwhelmed
everything
else
in
the
brew
the
beer
did
taste
fresh
however
and
the
aftertaste
was
not
unpleasant
above
average
for
the
style
below
average
overall
could
this
be
a
bad
bud
clone
please
sir
no
more
forty
of
iron
city
this
was
and
continues
to
be
a
staple
of
my
hometown
i
have
found
myself
low
on
cash
as
of
lately
and
i
figured
what
better
times
to
go
back
to
my
roots
pours
a
true
golden
tone
with
a
highly
carbonated
thick
white
head
that
could
be
compared
to
the
billowing
smoke
clouds
that
that
left
the
steel
mills
of
pittsburghs
past
everything
about
this
beer
says
its
classic
you
have
to
love
the
old
school
label
the
aroma
is
a
very
faint
bitterness
with
some
sweet
tones
hidden
in
there
the
taste
however
is
the
true
reason
to
throw
back
this
beer
it
is
a
crisp
american
lager
not
too
watered
down
definitey
packs
some
flavor
the
sweetness
of
corn
and
rice
adjuncts
is
the
backbone
with
some
mild
hop
bitterness
here
to
form
one
great
summertime
lawnmower
beer
not
an
all
grain
beer
but
much
better
than
the
adjunct
ridden
garbage
anhueser
busch
throws
at
us
i
will
definitely
drink
local
and
think
globally
in
this
situation
a
light
to
medium
body
that
is
true
to
its
american
lager
profile
i
will
always
keep
a
place
in
my
heart
for
this
historic
beer
of
the
city
i
was
born
in
pours
a
medium
gold
color
topped
by
a
slightly
offwhite
head
this
beer
maintains
a
thin
layer
of
foam
atop
the
beer
but
not
quite
as
well
as
ic
light
the
fairly
light
aroma
is
very
grassy
with
a
slight
sweet
grain
note
the
taste
has
a
noticeable
sweetness
followed
by
a
bit
of
bitterness
there
is
a
slight
harshness
in
the
midtaste
the
aftertaste
is
a
lingering
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
especially
for
a
macro
carbonation
mixes
well
with
the
body
of
the
beer
so
you
actually
can
tell
there
is
something
in
your
mouth
and
it
feels
good
the
drinkability
is
pretty
much
average
you
can
drink
a
few
of
these
and
you
might
want
to
if
youre
in
the
right
mood
between
this
and
ic
light
the
ic
light
would
be
in
my
glass
but
what
can
be
better
than
drinking
a
cold
arn
on
a
rainy
day
while
the
pirates
are
on
tv
obviously
i
couldnt
think
of
anything
because
thats
my
afternoon
if
you
see
iron
city
give
it
a
try
too
bad
heard
pittsburgh
brewing
company
is
behind
on
its
payments
to
the
city
of
pittsburgh
was
hoping
for
a
better
product
hope
it
doesnt
become
another
victim
of
the
big
3
but
itll
have
to
do
a
better
job
of
defending
itself
a
very
good
session
beer
light
to
medium
golden
colour
with
a
matching
body
aroma
is
crisp
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
what
really
got
my
attention
well
balanced
and
clean
not
a
great
brew
but
a
very
good
brew
and
for
the
money
an
exellent
value
i
could
drink
gallons
of
this
and
probobly
will
in
pittsburgh
its
cheap
drinkable
and
fresh
it
was
pale
yellow
with
no
sustainable
head
it
kind
of
smelled
like
corn
and
grain
to
me
on
tasting
there
was
only
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
and
hops
but
mainly
grain
and
a
little
vegetable
it
was
quite
light
in
body
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
do
love
that
it
a
regional
brew
deeply
connected
with
the
city
crystal
clear
straw
hue
topped
by
a
typically
meager
head
indicative
of
ample
adjunct
use
the
relatively
clean
but
unenticing
aroma
is
comprised
of
sweet
corn
a
touch
of
dms
and
a
barely
perceptible
floral
hop
nose
the
bland
flavor
is
dominated
by
corn
but
corn
sweetness
and
cooked
cabbage
thankfully
arent
as
overbearing
as
other
american
lagers
husky
6
row
notes
are
assertive
but
arent
astringent
provide
the
only
noteable
malt
character
of
this
brew
the
hop
bitterness
is
above
the
norm
compared
to
the
mundane
american
lager
when
coupled
with
the
sharp
carbonation
this
beer
is
almost
biting
in
mouthfeel
finishes
bittersweet
from
corny
sweetness
and
light
hop
bitterness
iron
city
is
bland
and
expectedly
adjunct
laden
but
is
perhaps
a
notch
above
other
domestics
notes
not
very
clean
at
all
better
off
just
sticking
with
a
bud
miller
or
coors
than
tangling
with
this
brew
a
subpremium
american
lager
that
is
not
worth
my
time
this
beer
poured
a
verly
pale
yellow
color
and
formed
no
head
and
no
lace
an
aroma
of
hops
and
grain
a
flavor
of
grain
and
some
dough
aspects
finish
was
extremely
light
and
some
bite
present
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
on
many
occasions
i
find
it
to
be
no
better
than
the
other
smaller
macrobrews
like
rolling
rock
but
the
cult
following
of
this
is
amazing
i
went
to
a
party
in
college
and
all
the
people
who
lived
there
were
iron
city
drinkers
we
were
all
drinking
the
usual
keg
swill
and
they
were
walking
around
with
bottles
of
iron
city
went
upstairs
and
they
had
filled
the
bathtub
with
ice
and
filled
it
with
iron
city
this
beer
focuses
on
marketing
and
promotions
but
should
instead
change
their
recipe
first
glimpse
is
of
a
pale
sickly
yellow
brew
what
little
head
there
is
is
weak
and
artificial
smell
is
weak
and
not
fresh
and
is
reminiscent
of
cooked
corn
slight
sweet
malty
overtones
with
too
little
hops
corn
and
rice
adjuncts
are
almost
overpowering
and
get
worse
as
the
brew
warms
up
tastes
chemical
like
must
almost
be
drunk
at
near
freezing
temperatures
to
remain
palatable
hmmm
seems
like
fdoosey
has
a
point
as
our
sample
of
iron
city
wasnt
particularly
metallic
pours
with
a
small
white
head
has
a
clear
bright
yellow
color
smells
faintly
salty
sour
but
not
much
tastes
watery
malty
slightly
salty
sour
aftertaste
surprisingly
mediumlight
body
might
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
but
not
much
else
light
to
medium
yellow
mildly
grainy
nose
almost
discernible
hop
bitterness
a
slightly
sweet
underlying
flavor
makes
what
would
be
a
typical
american
lager
actually
taste
like
something
other
than
carbonated
water
i
will
say
this
beer
sux
assbut
one
of
my
good
buddies
it
ptown
took
me
to
a
steelers
game
and
i
tailgated
all
day
drinkin
this
stuffnot
good
but
drank
at
least
16
and
i
cheeredon
the
steelers
even
though
iam
lions
fan
better
than
ab
productsa
classic
in
the
iron
city
very
metallic
to
the
point
of
distracting
the
assessment
of
what
little
flavor
the
lager
would
have
anyway
color
clear
straw
smells
lightly
of
pine
bars
that
tend
to
have
this
on
tap
also
tend
to
maintain
their
tap
system
very
poorly
not
adding
to
the
beers
appeal
and
pittsburgh
brewing
contract
brews
samual
adams
historically
i
think
iron
city
was
one
of
the
first
canned
beers
i
think
with
pulloff
tabs
there
havent
been
many
beers
that
i
didnt
care
to
finish
however
this
was
one
of
them
had
this
from
a
12
oz
long
leck
bottle
the
flavor
was
astringent
and
metallic
to
the
point
that
i
felt
it
was
stripping
the
enamel
off
my
teeth
this
is
a
good
cheap
beer
it
has
a
very
unique
taste
which
some
love
but
i
admittedly
dont
still
looks
great
and
goes
down
smooth
it
also
gets
points
for
being
brewed
in
my
home
state
of
mn
this
is
a
classic
beer
with
rich
flavor
and
an
unpretentious
reputation
originating
in
northeast
minneapolis
i
rate
it
so
highly
based
on
its
simplicity
full
flavor
and
also
quite
if
bit
of
nostalgia
smells
fruity
kinda
like
bananas
this
is
what
i
drank
before
before
the
craft
beer
explosion
well
this
and
summit
pale
ale
its
got
a
whole
lot
more
flavor
than
bud
which
isnt
saying
much
and
i
still
buy
it
for
making
beer
bratsthen
save
the
leftovers
for
guests
who
dont
appreciate
the
good
stuff
overall
its
okay
but
if
i
want
to
really
enjoy
a
lager
ill
pick
up
some
brooklyn
as
a
minnesotan
this
is
what
i
grew
up
with
as
far
as
my
early
beerdrinking
days
went
its
better
than
your
typical
american
lager
and
is
sometimes
what
ill
buy
when
i
need
a
break
from
my
beloved
stouts
and
other
heavier
beers
especially
in
the
summer
is
it
a
worldclass
beer
no
but
its
a
quality
easydrinking
beer
thats
a
good
value
its
like
a
friend
you
occasionally
hook
up
with
but
dont
feel
awkward
or
ashamed
about
afterwards
this
is
my
fallback
when
not
drinking
craft
brews
it
doesnt
taste
like
water
like
most
macrobrews
easy
drinking
when
you
plan
on
having
more
than
one
i
also
like
that
it
is
brewed
in
my
home
state
of
mn
this
is
my
goto
favorite
beer
same
for
my
grandfather
and
his
grandfathers
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
tastes
soo
good
beats
bud
light
coors
light
etc
for
me
on
every
level
watery
very
little
taste
true
american
original
drain
pour
that
might
not
be
everyones
idea
of
a
good
time
but
i
always
have
some
grain
belt
standing
by
overall
well
balanced
and
outstanding
in
the
adjunct
lager
style
perhaps
the
best
i
have
had
thus
far
in
short
you
get
what
you
pay
for
hopped
crap
theres
a
ton
of
aals
especially
grain
belt
that
are
in
my
opinion
better
than
most
craft
beers
anyway
overall
a
great
beer
and
staple
of
the
midwest
overall
this
beer
is
a
clear
winner
its
got
the
right
flavor
in
the
right
areas
and
keeps
it
simple
this
beer
is
like
high
life
but
better
grain
belt
is
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
friends
for
almost
any
occasion
the
friendly
beer
not
going
to
lie
im
a
homer
and
this
is
the
home
town
beer
well
gbp
and
epa
are
the
home
town
beers
but
this
is
the
original
its
a
corny
lager
not
my
favourite
but
probably
my
second
favourite
its
sort
of
sweet
which
is
my
only
complaint
but
its
a
nice
sweetness
we
like
sweet
here
give
me
a
jucy
lucy
and
a
premo
and
some
fries
and
im
in
fucking
heaven
gbp
is
liquid
history
a
regional
brand
that
somehow
didnt
get
sucked
into
the
multinational
brewing
conglomeration
a
fucking
time
capsule
your
grandfather
drank
this
beer
and
so
do
his
grand
kids
im
grateful
for
that
and
im
proud
that
pennsylvania
and
minnesota
somehow
managed
to
keep
the
wolves
at
bay
and
retain
their
regional
brewers
schells
in
mns
case
who
keep
the
gb
torch
alight
a
far
from
useful
but
from
the
heart
drunken
review
you
are
welcome
what
can
i
say
this
is
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
for
the
price
where
else
can
you
get
a
case
of
tasty
suds
for
so
little
i
know
you
beer
snobs
will
turn
your
noses
up
at
this
awesome
midwest
treat
thats
been
passed
from
father
to
son
for
over
a
hundred
years
cleansmooth
and
sweet
i
love
it
goes
great
at
the
ball
gamedeer
campor
avoiding
the
wife
take
my
recomendation
and
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
you
wont
regret
it
all
hail
to
the
big
friendly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
purchase
as
a
workhorse
in
the
fridge
if
i
lived
local
see
why
it
is
very
populer
in
the
college
town
of
eau
claire
this
is
my
up
north
brew
in
the
taverns
as
well
as
the
cabin
i
love
seeing
the
old
grain
belt
signs
in
the
small
towns
in
north
western
wisconsin
and
minnesota
its
great
to
see
the
neon
premium
signs
and
places
still
serving
it
on
tap
the
name
grain
belt
how
working
class
no
nonsense
can
you
get
love
it
well
this
is
a
commercial
beer
that
schells
bought
out
some
years
ago
so
it
is
no
suprise
that
it
is
a
lot
like
other
commercial
american
lagers
however
i
think
this
one
is
a
cut
above
and
makes
for
a
great
brew
on
hot
day
a
flavorful
clean
crisp
lager
i
wanted
to
dislike
it
but
i
dont
sweetness
is
almost
too
much
but
it
backs
off
right
when
i
want
it
to
its
close
to
being
really
really
good
with
a
few
little
things
not
quite
measuring
up
but
overall
i
dig
it
at
home
i
pour
a
12
0z
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
out
draft
is
usually
pretty
tasty
overall
clean
crisp
refreshing
cheap
got
a
12
pack
of
tall
boys
for
12
a
bit
aboveaverage
for
the
style
it
is
what
it
is
and
hits
the
spot
after
too
many
ipas
or
imperial
stouts
it
helps
to
cleanse
the
palate
12
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
thanks
bennett
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
with
a
finger
of
awkward
white
foam
excellent
lacing
and
retention
smell
is
cereal
grains
sweet
corn
and
some
chemical
smelling
fruit
not
a
great
aroma
taste
is
spot
on
though
great
balance
between
the
grainy
malts
and
sweet
corn
with
an
underlying
hop
fruitiness
clean
and
crisp
this
drinks
very
easily
with
no
real
aftertaste
of
any
kind
not
overly
carbonated
or
too
thin
just
a
damn
solid
adjunct
lager
this
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
only
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
a
fair
amount
of
grains
in
the
mix
lots
of
flavorful
grains
in
the
taste
that
actually
make
this
somewhat
pleasant
to
drink
reminds
me
of
miller
genuine
draft
on
steroids
premium
is
kind
of
become
a
hipstery
beer
here
in
wisconsin
because
you
cant
find
it
everywhere
here
mostly
just
minnesota
or
wisconsin
city
near
the
border
its
a
better
than
some
of
the
other
big
macro
brews
but
not
really
better
than
high
life
old
milwaukee
or
pbr
in
my
opinion
fun
novelty
beer
in
the
sense
that
its
not
everywhere
taste
is
like
you
would
expect
pretty
much
the
same
as
a
miller
high
life
cereal
grains
with
a
sweet
after
taste
nice
light
mouth
feel
almost
a
sour
after
taste
its
not
offensive
or
over
powering
skunkiness
like
most
cheap
lagers
that
come
in
clear
bottles
if
you
are
in
some
small
midwestern
town
bar
and
are
looking
to
get
drunk
i
think
this
is
the
best
you
are
going
to
find
light
light
yellow
with
a
loose
fitting
cap
of
bone
white
foam
absolute
clarity
smells
super
light
some
grain
some
maize
some
grass
clippings
and
a
hint
of
bread
taste
is
also
really
light
with
some
light
malt
a
touch
of
cornbread
with
sweetness
some
slight
bitterness
and
a
overture
of
steel
thin
real
thin
with
moderate
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
could
slam
this
all
day
on
a
hot
one
maybe
im
biased
because
i
am
from
minnesota
but
i
have
always
liked
this
beer
what
i
really
like
is
the
balance
of
the
taste
the
initial
flavor
is
sweeter
and
somewhat
fruitier
than
most
american
lagers
but
the
after
taste
is
a
bit
malty
and
grainfilled
i
like
that
it
also
has
a
fullness
to
the
mouthful
that
i
enjoy
the
coloring
is
a
beautiful
gold
and
although
the
smell
is
faint
it
is
inviting
especially
on
warm
days
overall
its
okay
nothing
special
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
simple
but
delicious
i
love
the
malts
o
decent
beer
for
the
style
goes
down
easy
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
cant
beat
the
price
an
cheap
easy
drinker
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
poundable
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
better
version
of
a
macro
maybe
my
favorite
lager
definitely
one
of
my
go
to
session
brews
i
like
keeping
a
couple
big
friendlies
around
in
case
of
emergency
drinkability
it
is
decent
enough
but
the
sweetness
is
very
offputting
for
a
lawn
mower
lager
ill
drink
it
regardless
notes
grab
a
16
oz
can
for
a
dollar
figuring
it
was
worth
a
try
its
really
what
i
expected
light
crisp
refreshing
but
mostly
devoid
of
any
complex
flavor
it
has
its
time
and
place
but
its
nothing
special
even
for
the
style
a
buddy
brought
a
12pck
of
cans
back
with
him
from
a
recent
trip
to
minnesota
beer
poured
a
golden
clear
with
thin
white
head
the
smell
and
taste
were
a
nice
balance
of
malt
grain
and
hop
the
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
is
it
fantastic
not
really
its
cheap
tastes
decent
and
really
beats
the
heat
thumbs
up
overall
above
average
in
its
category
but
definitely
in
the
bottom
10
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
o
its
not
that
good
of
a
beer
but
you
know
what
theres
something
enjoyable
about
these
maybe
its
just
that
its
an
adjunct
lager
that
is
slightly
better
than
some
of
the
pack
has
worth
at
the
baseball
game
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
light
head
that
faded
to
lace
quickly
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
and
was
of
malts
and
grains
slighltly
fruity
as
well
taste
was
unique
malt
and
corn
with
an
interesting
finish
of
light
hoppiness
tasted
like
high
life
with
an
extra
dash
of
corn
just
for
good
measure
that
said
it
was
pleasantly
different
than
other
mass
produced
lagers
in
that
corn
flavor
was
not
as
bitter
and
unpleasant
as
many
of
them
palate
was
acceptable
but
nothing
special
overall
not
too
bad
for
a
cheaper
pale
lager
o
its
good
as
far
as
adjuncts
go
id
prefer
it
over
most
bmc
stuff
can
drink
all
day
its
smooth
and
light
d
extremely
drinkable
but
the
taste
might
get
a
little
bland
after
a
while
o
when
im
in
the
mood
for
crappy
beer
this
is
a
personal
favorite
it
has
a
fair
amount
of
taste
and
aroma
for
an
adjunct
lager
far
from
a
great
beer
but
its
not
terrible
either
its
a
good
beer
for
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
crappy
to
quote
a
coworker
of
mine
its
like
budweiser
but
good
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
corn
slightly
sweet
taste
is
crisp
malty
a
touch
of
sweetness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
can
poured
into
my
capital
brewery
tulip
just
cuz
pours
a
clear
light
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
big
white
head
looked
very
classically
like
beer
the
nose
is
very
bland
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
maybe
the
slightest
suggestion
of
exposure
to
a
hop
or
two
the
taste
is
really
nice
for
the
style
drinks
crisp
with
just
the
tinniest
hint
of
blueberry
which
really
works
for
me
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
leaving
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
one
of
my
preferred
options
for
the
aal
style
cant
call
it
a
fantastic
beer
in
any
capacity
but
that
little
hint
of
blueberry
helps
a
ton
notes
premium
is
a
decent
beer
with
a
little
more
body
and
flavor
than
others
of
the
style
have
to
offer
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
sometimes
its
just
whats
called
for
i
think
a
lot
of
people
just
dig
this
beer
for
the
old
school
retroness
of
it
its
like
pbr
but
for
the
working
man
who
doesnt
smell
and
dress
like
hipster
shit
my
homie
from
mn
swore
by
this
stuff
in
school
wasnt
bad
wouldnt
be
buying
it
anytime
soon
other
but
it
does
belong
in
that
cool
class
of
adjunct
beer
like
blatz
schlitz
rhinelander
etc
as
far
as
the
american
adjunct
lager
goes
this
is
the
best
ive
had
its
smooth
inexpensive
and
actually
tastes
fairly
decent
if
youre
a
bmc
kind
of
guy
that
wants
a
real
treat
id
say
check
this
one
out
d
i
was
expecting
some
sort
of
bmc
product
with
this
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
more
flavorful
and
better
drinking
than
its
counterparts
thanks
to
keefd
for
the
chance
overall
this
is
my
favorite
adjunct
lagger
and
it
also
bring
back
a
lot
of
memories
of
growing
up
here
in
minnesota
great
beer
for
the
style
but
low
on
the
complexity
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
for
an
adjunct
lager
by
far
my
favorite
for
the
style
and
a
great
tradition
here
in
minnesota
d
the
sweetness
some
have
reviewed
it
as
honey
but
it
was
more
corn
syrup
to
me
is
just
too
much
for
my
palate
there
are
several
other
adjuncts
such
as
pbr
that
i
would
rather
drink
there
seems
to
be
a
slight
sweetness
in
the
flavor
along
with
some
pronounced
grains
i
can
actually
taste
some
of
the
malts
although
no
hops
overall
very
drinkable
and
always
my
choice
over
bmc
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
pales
in
comparison
to
schlitz
the
corn
puts
the
adjunct
into
this
american
adjunct
lager
and
they
brewers
are
not
being
shy
about
it
in
the
end
a
drinkable
version
of
the
stylebetter
than
many
others
i
have
had
in
this
category
d
way
easy
to
drink
bottom
line
theres
little
to
commend
in
this
basically
light
watery
oddly
flavored
swill
sure
there
are
worse
beers
out
there
im
looking
at
you
inbevab
but
thats
hardly
an
excuse
for
this
crap
given
a
choice
id
probably
save
myself
the
calories
and
drink
the
equally
swill
like
premium
light
this
is
pretty
bad
do
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
was
last
night
after
hearing
from
a
couple
friends
from
mn
how
great
of
a
drinkable
beer
it
was
id
have
to
agree
drinkability
is
top
notch
perhaps
the
best
adjunct
lager
ive
ever
had
d
very
drinkable
so
easy
to
drink
and
it
actually
has
some
flavors
the
rare
times
that
i
do
want
an
adjunct
this
is
usually
the
one
i
go
to
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
barely
wanted
the
first
one
now
i
am
looking
at
my
second
all
adjunct
lagers
should
be
this
good
d
if
i
hadnt
been
so
full
of
beer
various
snacks
and
meals
and
who
knows
what
else
this
would
have
been
a
little
easier
to
drink
however
it
was
much
better
than
the
equivalently
priced
miller
lite
d
i
remember
now
why
i
choose
to
drink
this
over
other
adjunct
lagers
pretty
good
flavor
for
the
style
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
lighter
malt
liquor
i
can
see
why
my
grandpa
used
to
drink
this
but
not
warm
though
i
could
drink
this
beer
everyday
all
summer
long
everytime
we
go
up
to
the
cabin
this
is
the
beer
we
grab
out
of
the
fridge
and
have
on
the
boat
it
beats
all
of
the
macrobrews
lagers
anyday
and
is
brewed
right
here
in
minnesota
i
had
this
most
recently
on
tap
in
my
kegerator
with
a
15
5
gallon
keg
that
i
bought
from
zipps
in
minneapolis
my
pour
produced
two
fingers
worth
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
which
also
produced
a
good
bit
of
lacing
as
it
fell
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
liquid
sunshine
in
a
glass
nose
was
the
standard
for
the
style
a
slight
lager
sweetness
upstaged
by
odd
scents
in
this
case
including
a
grapiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
was
not
as
bad
in
the
mouth
as
i
was
girding
myself
for
it
was
a
typical
aal
with
the
usual
lager
sweetness
accompanied
by
cereal
flavors
finish
was
likewise
passable
but
somehow
my
fascination
may
have
also
passed
d
a
decent
lager
good
start
to
a
beer
session
d
goes
down
pretty
well
nothing
to
complain
about
just
a
simple
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
about
medium
for
a
lager
a
good
sumer
session
beer
and
even
better
since
this
is
sold
at
a
price
comparable
to
bmc
but
tastes
better
than
the
big
boys
d
a
decent
adjunt
lager
with
sustainable
drinkability
enjoy
brought
back
from
minnesota
and
shared
with
me
by
a
former
minnesota
resident
who
raved
about
it
nonstop
pours
from
the
can
a
light
to
medium
gold
color
seriously
carbonated
and
topped
with
a
decent
amount
of
white
foam
smells
a
bit
grainy
and
a
little
bit
sweet
nothing
unexpected
on
the
palate
a
somewhat
sweet
grainy
and
well
carbonated
beer
crisp
refreshing
and
very
good
for
what
it
is
great
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
its
frequently
discounted
in
minnesota
12pk
usually
making
it
not
only
a
very
respectable
american
adjunct
but
a
walletfriendly
one
too
update
415
i
went
out
and
purchased
a
12
pack
and
theres
no
cat
poop
smell
in
these
bottles
i
may
have
gotten
an
old
one
before
at
8
9912pk
here
in
the
midwest
its
not
too
bad
i
like
its
smoothness
i
possibly
may
get
tired
of
it
after
56
bottles
over
the
course
of
a
week
or
so
still
not
as
good
as
rolling
rock
my
current
fav
but
not
a
bad
beer
nonetheless
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
adjunct
yeast
and
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
pale
malt
adjunct
and
a
hint
of
hops
overall
a
slightly
better
than
average
adjunct
lager
properly
carbonated
light
bodied
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
refreshing
to
drink
if
only
all
american
adjunct
lagers
were
this
good
drinkability
ha
ha
yeah
this
beer
is
drinkable
a
case
goes
by
ridiculously
fast
easy
and
smooth
when
i
was
growing
up
my
dad
collected
old
beer
bottles
cans
and
glasses
so
being
from
minnesota
he
had
a
lot
of
grain
belt
stuff
so
when
i
was
old
enough
to
buy
my
own
beer
the
image
of
the
red
diamond
on
top
of
a
silver
cap
was
engraved
in
my
mind
my
first
taste
was
light
on
hops
and
had
a
nice
refreshing
almost
sweet
taste
with
a
kind
of
banana
taste
i
was
hooked
and
it
is
my
number
one
beer
for
daily
drinking
d
if
you
live
in
the
twin
cities
and
want
a
excellently
drinkable
barbecue
or
party
beer
that
you
can
down
gallons
of
this
is
the
one
i
gave
this
one
a
low
rating
because
it
isnt
that
good
of
a
beer
however
i
am
absolutely
in
love
with
it
and
cant
live
without
it
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cheap
tap
or
while
listening
to
a
twins
game
in
the
backyard
with
a
burger
something
everyone
in
the
state
of
minnesota
can
agree
upon
overall
for
what
this
beer
is
it
is
excellent
the
sweetness
is
just
slightly
offputting
but
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
lawnmower
beer
i
can
live
with
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
and
possibly
stock
it
for
my
family
that
drinks
what
they
call
light
beer
it
may
not
be
my
personal
flavor
of
choice
but
the
obvious
hop
presence
and
malt
flavor
makes
this
beer
a
winning
choice
for
my
go
to
american
lager
without
a
doubt
and
coming
from
an
ipa
fan
this
beer
should
be
about
as
out
of
my
range
as
they
can
get
but
it
wasnt
overall
i
actually
really
liked
this
for
the
style
i
thought
it
held
up
quite
well
and
i
would
not
mind
having
it
again
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
smaller
head
smells
of
sweet
grain
sweeter
than
normal
for
this
style
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
not
getting
anything
but
the
sweet
grainmalt
not
complex
but
still
pretty
satisfying
top
end
of
light
bodied
but
not
quite
medium
smooth
very
drinkable
its
easy
to
session
and
easy
to
find
i
could
do
a
day
of
these
d
this
is
a
great
beer
for
summers
and
nights
out
if
you
have
to
go
with
an
adjunct
go
with
grain
belt
nice
smooth
golden
color
with
a
scent
of
corn
malt
the
taste
is
very
good
for
an
adjunct
lager
almost
like
a
malty
popsickle
strange
way
to
define
it
i
know
but
very
true
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
pronounced
corn
malt
flavor
and
very
little
hop
profile
this
beer
is
way
too
drinkable
this
may
be
the
best
example
of
a
lawnmower
beer
out
there
pale
gold
with
very
little
lacing
on
the
surface
and
a
light
rim
of
foam
around
the
edges
pretty
still
with
just
some
light
prickle
popping
up
through
the
center
of
the
glass
mild
nose
of
malt
and
some
touches
of
grain
the
attack
is
pretty
simple
and
doesnt
really
surprise
you
the
finish
is
pretty
smooth
and
much
maltier
than
i
expected
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
low
presence
of
grains
and
hops
pretty
smooth
and
clean
and
if
i
am
ever
stuck
choosing
between
it
and
other
mass
produced
beers
i
will
go
this
way
d
good
stuff
here
i
like
this
beer
as
a
summer
bbqtype
brew
dvery
drinkable
i
may
have
a
slight
bias
as
this
was
the
beer
we
drank
in
college
to
drink
the
good
stuff
i
once
bought
three
casees
of
it
and
smuggled
it
into
my
dorm
in
a
suitcase
oh
the
days
as
a
result
of
my
history
with
this
beer
it
will
forever
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
session
brews
around
regardless
of
its
lessthangreat
taste
d
meh
md
the
feel
is
hard
and
rough
but
without
a
full
body
character
the
drinkability
is
tough
as
well
with
the
weird
taste
and
the
rough
feel
best
by
date
of
80509
logoembossed
clear
glass
bottle
this
is
considered
a
local
favorite
in
the
category
but
i
just
dont
like
the
corn
o
nice
but
fairly
bland
macroadjunct
a
minnesota
classic
my
dad
used
to
stock
his
fridge
with
this
stuff
and
hamms
and
pbr
it
has
survived
a
few
brewery
closings
but
thankfully
schells
picked
up
the
recipe
and
launched
a
great
marketing
campaign
to
reintroduce
this
beer
to
another
generation
not
going
to
win
any
beer
awards
but
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
its
a
great
beer
with
food
most
excellent
to
wash
down
brats
and
burgers
in
the
summertime
grain
belt
is
one
of
the
true
best
in
this
style
it
has
a
delicious
and
classic
taste
that
time
cannot
affect
it
pours
nice
and
although
it
doesnt
have
a
great
appearance
or
smell
it
goes
down
incredibly
easy
especially
when
icecold
a
true
mans
beer
grain
belt
is
an
excellent
choice
especially
with
food
pours
a
golden
body
with
a
stream
of
bubbles
supporting
a
two
finger
white
head
smells
fairly
corny
with
graint
malt
and
the
slightest
amount
of
hops
tastes
very
good
for
the
style
maybe
the
best
ive
had
strong
grain
with
hints
of
corn
and
hop
make
a
very
mellow
but
flavorful
adjunct
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
and
well
carbonated
very
drinkable
as
are
most
of
the
style
unless
the
taste
is
just
awful
i
am
reviewing
this
beer
based
on
its
style
not
on
how
it
compares
to
dipas
or
barleywines
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
two
finger
bone
white
head
that
left
some
pretty
decent
looking
lace
rings
down
the
glass
aroma
is
cereal
grain
and
corn
sweet
and
very
little
earthy
hops
taste
is
sweet
for
the
style
but
its
good
its
very
grainy
and
cereal
like
think
of
pale
malt
mixed
with
corn
flakes
very
tasty
for
the
style
hey
at
least
theres
no
rice
in
there
right
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
in
the
summertime
its
easily
my
favorite
adjunct
lager
d
good
to
have
with
food
or
if
im
gonna
be
having
several
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
macro
lager
style
beer
would
probably
be
better
in
summer
but
its
ok
as
a
substitute
for
bmc
for
high
quantity
drinking
although
at
10
99
for
a
12
of
bottles
it
is
not
very
cost
effective
im
not
dissapointed
i
tried
it
but
unless
i
find
this
for
89
a
12
ill
be
skipping
it
over
one
of
my
favorite
macros
brewed
in
new
ulm
so
it
doesnt
travel
far
before
it
hits
my
lips
the
large
premium
sign
in
st
paul
is
a
landmark
i
smile
at
whenever
i
see
it
ontap
at
the
blue
nile
appears
a
clear
brilliant
gold
with
no
head
i
think
this
beer
is
really
an
example
of
how
to
make
the
most
out
of
adjunct
beer
yes
it
tastes
like
corn
in
fact
it
tastes
a
lot
like
corn
but
unlike
miller
light
another
corny
beer
in
my
mind
grain
belt
is
smooth
with
subtle
bready
malts
i
mean
unless
you
dont
like
cornflavored
beer
and
thats
understandable
this
is
a
great
lawnmower
beer
macro
beer
at
its
best
d
its
the
perfect
beer
for
a
day
at
the
ball
park
or
an
outdoor
bbq
with
friends
drink
it
like
you
would
drink
a
bud
or
miller
only
enjoy
it
a
million
times
more
i
would
drink
this
often
one
of
the
beers
i
keep
on
hand
found
that
women
who
like
a
casual
beer
like
this
grain
belt
premium
on
tap
what
youll
get
is
a
fairly
bubbly
yellow
glass
of
beer
with
a
pretty
muted
smell
and
a
nice
effervescent
mouthfeel
and
a
good
grainy
flavor
this
is
a
humble
beer
that
more
than
holds
its
own
against
phony
craft
beers
like
leinenkugel
and
blows
macros
out
of
the
water
perfect
compliment
to
hot
dogs
on
the
grill
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
it
was
a
below
average
beer
in
par
with
the
bmcs
not
one
that
id
buy
but
glad
i
got
to
try
since
its
a
minnesota
legend
not
bad
not
tremendously
different
from
other
american
lagers
im
familiar
with
but
this
beer
offers
an
exceptionally
clean
probably
means
tasteless
taste
and
a
clean
but
not
really
watery
mouthfeel
it
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
but
is
definitely
not
skunky
appearance
is
yellow
brilliant
and
fizzy
with
a
think
and
soapy
head
not
bad
overall
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
going
on
but
it
is
a
local
favorite
it
doesnt
cost
that
much
which
is
nice
and
you
can
drink
a
few
without
filling
up
taste
is
smooth
sweet
and
a
hint
of
hops
as
with
other
macros
grain
is
also
predominant
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
with
middle
of
the
road
taste
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
it
reminds
me
of
a
low
alcohol
malt
liquor
avoid
this
beer
overall
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
picked
up
a
12
pack
for
cheapo
beer
over
the
4th
unfortunately
the
taste
reminded
me
too
much
of
malt
liquor
ill
still
finish
the
12
but
i
probably
wont
come
back
to
it
again
d
the
perfect
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
with
family
hands
down
grain
belt
is
the
best
adjunct
lager
ive
had
thus
far
i
think
ill
be
stocking
up
on
this
the
next
time
i
head
back
east
the
body
is
closer
to
light
than
moderate
next
to
no
carbonation
and
a
offsetting
finish
leaves
a
filmy
finish
overall
not
recommended
not
recommended
at
all
d
the
big
key
as
with
most
macros
at
least
for
me
is
bottle
vs
in
the
glass
for
me
this
beer
is
quite
a
bit
better
from
the
bottle
but
even
in
the
glass
it
beats
out
many
other
macros
because
of
its
thirst
quenching
abilities
and
low
abv
it
has
nice
drinkability
this
poured
from
the
tap
as
a
pale
yellow
gold
lager
with
sparse
white
head
and
soso
lacing
i
get
a
fairly
classic
weak
wheat
aroma
but
its
ok
a
bit
of
lemony
citrus
overtone
more
malt
presence
in
the
flavor
still
very
thin
with
a
fair
carbonation
present
a
bit
of
tang
on
the
tongue
pretty
watery
but
really
not
bad
tasting
ok
for
a
refreshing
guzzler
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
will
do
nicely
to
wash
down
most
anything
a
good
picnic
beer
i
guess
this
is
my
favorite
summertime
chugger
up
at
the
cabin
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
definite
crisp
appleapplepeel
quality
along
with
aromatic
grain
honey
and
flowers
in
the
finish
its
smooth
very
crisp
yet
flavourful
and
has
clean
taste
and
feel
surprisingly
tasty
flavors
of
apple
and
bready
malt
with
a
little
honey
on
the
back
end
a
dry
and
clean
aftertaste
is
what
sets
it
apart
from
other
lawnmower
beers
carbonation
is
steady
and
even
and
gives
it
a
light
feeling
the
clean
finish
makes
it
palatable
and
easy
to
session
no
doubt
this
is
a
surprising
beer
if
you
pop
a
cap
expecting
a
bmc
youll
be
shocked
real
flavor
exists
here
try
it
and
see
what
american
lagers
can
be
mouthfeel
is
good
almost
perfect
for
this
style
high
but
not
to
high
levels
of
carbonation
and
thin
but
what
did
you
expect
with
this
beer
easy
drinking
good
tasting
macro
lager
ill
have
a
few
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
the
head
is
small
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
thin
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
with
a
nice
spicy
hop
edge
the
taste
is
of
light
biscuity
malt
with
a
faint
hop
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
if
i
had
to
drink
an
adjunct
lager
this
would
be
it
it
has
more
malt
and
hop
flavor
than
any
other
macro
lager
i
have
had
and
the
carbonation
isnt
annoyingly
high
the
beer
flattens
quickly
with
too
modest
carbonation
letting
this
beer
down
im
far
from
impressed
with
this
and
will
studiously
avoid
it
in
the
future
not
worth
trying
in
my
estimation
d
this
is
the
first
beer
i
ever
tried
that
i
liked
a
few
years
ago
prior
to
advancing
to
the
fancier
stuff
so
its
nostalgic
for
me
aside
from
that
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
so
i
would
say
that
its
extremely
drinkable
i
have
been
a
consumer
of
the
premium
since
the
70s
when
my
attempt
to
keep
the
old
northeast
minneapolis
grain
belt
brewery
in
business
failed
i
am
an
avid
collector
of
grain
belt
memorabia
even
though
my
tastes
have
branched
out
into
the
ale
world
i
still
keep
a
case
of
premium
on
hand
i
believe
that
the
currrent
premium
is
very
close
to
the
original
recipe
it
will
always
be
my
favorite
lager
kudos
to
schells
for
keeping
the
premium
alive
for
future
generations
to
enjoy
a
minneapolis
classic
but
i
still
long
for
the
tougher
and
better
tasting
grain
belt
golden
august
schell
has
done
a
good
job
bringing
the
brand
back
to
relevance
the
premium
brand
has
a
semisweet
macro
taste
and
pale
yellow
appearance
it
is
a
good
example
of
an
everyday
midwestern
beer
this
beer
tastes
very
good
alongside
a
roast
beef
sandwich
at
mayslacks
in
nordeast
thinner
medium
body
good
carbonation
a
bit
drying
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
surprisingly
decent
if
this
was
available
in
my
area
i
may
even
keep
a
sixer
of
it
in
the
fridge
for
my
macro
buddies
and
me
occasionally
thanks
ed
very
drinkable
can
sit
around
and
drink
a
12
pack
if
you
really
want
to
pretty
cheap
and
enjoyable
also
being
that
im
in
mankato
this
is
brewed
about
a
half
hour
down
the
road
light
and
crisp
very
refreshing
moderately
carbonated
this
is
a
good
beer
great
for
social
occasions
i
prefer
this
macro
over
almost
any
other
no
ones
trying
to
impress
anyone
here
its
the
beer
grandma
used
to
drink
and
theyre
just
keeping
a
good
thing
going
my
main
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
tad
expensive
for
its
market
segment
if
there
are
added
costs
due
to
superior
ingredients
and
brewing
processes
than
i
will
give
a
pass
another
is
the
clear
bottle
put
it
in
a
proper
brown
bottle
for
longer
shelf
life
overall
this
regional
classic
isnt
too
bad
but
nothing
that
ill
order
again
last
swigs
reviewed
as
an
agreement
with
fellow
ba
darkerthebetter
he
sad
to
me
you
can
have
this
if
you
agree
to
review
it
so
it
goes
if
this
were
sold
around
here
ya
might
find
a
six
pack
in
my
fridge
cheers
the
aroma
has
a
malty
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
corn
and
very
faint
hop
aroma
the
appearance
is
exception
for
a
beer
of
this
style
with
a
nice
golden
color
and
a
nice
white
head
that
shrinks
to
a
thin
lacy
top
that
leaves
some
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
not
intense
but
that
seems
true
of
most
american
lagers
it
is
a
pleasant
aroma
but
not
very
strong
taste
is
crisp
and
somewhat
malty
in
the
begining
and
the
finish
has
an
unusal
sweetness
to
it
that
i
find
intriguing
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
as
it
should
be
for
this
style
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
around
i
keep
a
half
barrel
on
tap
in
my
basement
bar
and
when
people
come
over
all
they
can
talk
about
is
how
surprisingly
good
this
beer
is
it
is
the
perfect
beer
with
bbq
and
pizza
and
lots
of
other
good
food
a
great
all
around
beer
in
this
style
category
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
macro
lager
i
was
very
suprised
by
this
beer
considering
the
classic
generic
beer
packaging
i
only
wish
i
could
get
these
in
ny
thanks
to
mac56
for
the
sample
for
those
who
like
to
order
a
beer
with
their
spicy
bloody
mary
ive
found
that
this
is
a
perfect
compliment
not
the
highest
marks
but
still
impressive
d
it
doesnt
look
very
good
but
the
taste
is
just
good
also
the
classic
look
is
great
im
typically
a
brown
ale
or
pale
ale
drinker
but
for
summertime
refreshment
you
cant
beat
this
offering
from
august
shell
brewing
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
beer
lover
out
fishing
or
after
playing
a
summertime
sport
it
does
have
a
sweeter
tatse
than
most
beers
but
also
it
does
posess
a
clean
finish
d
a
minnesota
staple
that
ill
never
stop
drinking
i
had
this
one
night
on
my
recent
trip
to
the
twin
cities
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
white
head
as
for
taste
and
smell
there
is
not
much
you
can
say
about
this
beer
that
you
couldnt
say
about
pbr
or
hamms
however
i
would
say
that
grain
belt
wins
by
a
nose
there
was
a
little
bit
of
canned
corn
in
the
smell
and
a
slightly
metalic
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
wet
and
bubbly
i
think
that
freshness
played
a
factor
in
its
moderate
drinkability
i
woudlnt
really
got
for
this
stuff
after
it
had
been
shipped
2
or
3
states
away
this
beer
served
its
purpose
and
i
cant
really
complain
about
that
originally
reviewed

aroma

a

of

over
stale

pour
of
clear

with
a
surprsing
run
of
decent
malt
flavor
but
then
quickly
fades
into
something
a
little
skunky
finishes
extremely
clean
ok
so
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
can
drink
all

not

you

be
warned
run
o

from
a
regional
brewer
very
easy
on
the
palate
and
a
good
beer
to
seek
out
at
the
end
of
the
night
if
youve
already
shocked
your
tastebuds
with
good
beer
premium
is
not
going
to
impress
anyone
it
is
your
average
american
domestic
pilsner
that
actually
is
a
bit
sweeter
especailly
out
of
a
keg
but
i
love
this
beer
it
is
local
it
tastes
better
than
the
average
domestic
and
for
some
reason
i
seem
to
be
able
to
drink
this
all
night
long
and
not
make
a
fool
of
myself
much
easier
said
than
done
if
there
is
not
something
decent
on
tap
at
a
bar
this
is
the
first
thing
i
order
i
have
much
more
than
respect
for
this
beer
simply
because
it
has
treated
me
so
well
for
so
long
dnot
bad
i
would
drink
this
over
a
macro
maybe
in
the
summer
because
it
is
so
light
and
maybe
because
it
is
local
easily
drinkable
pours
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
some
sweet
malts
maybe
some
corn
and
surprisingly
some
earthy
floral
hops
as
well
taste
mimics
the
smell
pretty
well
there
is
a
nice
refreshing
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
as
expected
but
it
has
a
small
amount
of
body
nothing
here
inhibits
drinkability
in
any
way
i
would
take
this
over
the
big
three
any
day
this
beer
came
a
darker
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
film
of
head
smells
of
lemons
roses
seriously
and
corn
tastes
of
sticky
candylike
wheat
malt
with
a
good
pairing
of
citrus
there
was
also
an
odd
hamburgerlike
flavor
that
came
through
that
wasnt
entirely
unpleasant
mouth
feel
is
very
thick
with
a
light
carbonation
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
that
gives
little
resistance
to
the
palate
with
a
pretty
good
flavor
and
a
nice
body
macro
color
macro
taste
but
ill
try
to
keep
an
open
mind
on
the
much
talkedabout
grainbelt
lets
go
with
the
facts
it
is
a
strawyellow
color
no
head
no
lace
the
aroma
is
nothing
but
rice
grainy
grassy
herbal
smell
with
a
hint
of
corn
thrown
in
there
the
taste
comes
down
to
a
combination
of
very
mild
grainy
malts
and
possibly
good
dishwater
thin
mouthfeel
slides
down
as
easy
as
cornflavored
water
remarkably
thats
what
i
found
out
this
is
thank
god
this
was
the
premium
grain
belt
id
hate
to
taste
what
the
subpar
grain
belt
tastes
like
this
is
not
a
bad
macro
poured
out
to
a
solid
golden
color
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
looks
like
the
beer
you
see
holmer
drinking
on
the
simpsons
aroma
of
malt
and
sweetness
with
some
cooked
grain
not
bad
flavor
was
rather
good
i
must
say
bread
corn
malt
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
toward
the
finish
was
very
nice
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
nothing
amazing
a
decent
level
of
drinkability
this
is
an
oldie
but
a
goodie
wish
we
had
it
here
in
the
motor
city
beats
the
hell
outta
any
other
macro
around
here
this
beer
is
a
little
hard
to
find
in
bars
but
fairly
easy
to
get
at
booze
stores
all
over
the
city
it
looks
like
beer
always
a
plus
in
my
book
it
smells
like
any
other
mass
produced
beer
but
with
a
small
difference
not
sure
what
it
is
but
i
like
it
taste
like
beer
once
again
a
plus
still
it
is
sweeter
then
most
other
beers
and
it
is
verry
drinkable
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
i
have
gotten
this
numerous
times
on
tap
usually
to
go
with
a
sweeter
desert
since
this
is
a
rather
sweet
beer
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
it
lacks
carbonation
but
its
lack
adds
to
the
sweetness
and
smoothness
of
this
beer
primarily
it
smells
malty
to
be
specific
malt
sweetness
it
tastes
of
malt
sweetness
aswell
with
very
little
hop
character
to
be
noticed
however
despite
this
beers
failure
to
be
unique
and
different
it
does
go
down
as
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
with
a
sweeter
plate
of
food
or
desert
grain
belt
has
two
strikes
against
it
right
off
the
bat
the
name
and
the
clear
glass
bottle
ultimately
though
they
matter
not
i
do
like
the
label
and
the
cap
they
ooze
old
school
cool
this
is
one
of
the
better
microbrewed
macro
lagers
in
existence
like
anything
else
it
has
its
time
and
its
place
i
could
see
myself
buying
at
least
a
few
sixers
every
summer
if
it
ever
makes
its
way
this
far
south
hats
off
to
schell
for
making
this
wonderfully
drinkable
affordably
priced
brew
hands
down
way
better
then
the
tapped
version
i
had
earlier
but
still
not
what
the
old
belt
was
quite
sad
indeed
wow
ive
heard
so
much
about
this
from
old
timers
heres
my
chance
pours
a
onefinger
white
mildly
yellow
head
of
large
bubbles
over
a
crystal
clear
faint
golden
liquid
smells
of
noble
hops
and
faintly
of
malt
sweet
my
guess
would
be
hallertauer
hops
or
maybe
saaz
not
tinny
enough
to
be
saaz
imo
tastes
clean
and
malty
some
hop
floral
is
present
but
almost
no
hop
bitter
yeah
thin
malt
with
mild
hop
floral
and
thats
about
it
perhaps
a
hint
of
munich
malt
in
the
form
of
the
chalky
dry
i
associate
with
munich
pretty
easy
drinking
i
can
see
why
this
was
such
a
hit
many
years
ago
before
craft
beers
came
out
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
craft
beer
but
its
a
touch
better
than
macroswill
light
body
not
super
light
just
light
and
moderate
but
sharp
carbonation
pours
a
clear
and
crisp
golden
color
quick
fading
foamy
white
head
smells
of
corn
and
grains
very
sweet
taste
is
sweet
pretty
much
all
sweet
grains
no
noticable
hops
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
macro
not
bad
at
all
the
sweetness
can
get
to
you
and
unfortunately
a
night
of
grain
belts
leaves
me
feeling
like
crap
the
next
morning
props
to
the

setting
me
up
with
a
bunch
of
his
leftovers
from
his
macro
madness
zap
you
do
indeed
rule
except
on
the
hardcourt
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
granted
a
lot
of
my
love
for
this
beer
comes
from
the
fact
that
it
is
what
my
dad
drank
when
i
was
younger
and
i
distinctly
remember
fetching
these
beers
for
him
and
sometimes
getting
a
sip
in
addition
this
was
my
staple
sessionparty
beer
in
college
i
was
and
still
am
proud
to
drink
this
and
i
am
very
happy
that
schells
revived
it
smart
profit
move
on
their
part
too
anyway
pours
a
very
clear
light
yellow
straw
with
a
cottony
fluff
of
cloudwhite
head
that
sticks
around
and
even
laces
the
glass
aroma
is
mild
but
nice
lightly
sweet
crisp
honeyish
malts
and
some
lemony
hop
notes
smells
refreshing
crisp
light
malty
sweetness
up
front
with
whiffs
of
corngood
corn
fine
im
obviously
biased
about
this
beer
but
i
dont
care
light
hop
bitterness
has
a
hint
of
citrus
in
it
and
takes
it
into
the
finish
light
bodied
and
refreshing
a
great
summer
party
beer
takes
me
back
to
my
college
days

of
this

a

but
it
rapidly
faded
away
to
nothing
a
sweet

to

comes
to

maybe
corn

the
taste
is
a
dead
match
nothing

but
nothing
to
rave
about
it
is
a
decent

that
works

leave
the

that
showcases
its
extremely
pale

can
see
right

like
an

straight
off

folks
the
beer
actually
tastes
like
a
can
of
light
cream
cornif
there
is
such
a
thing
the
mouth
feel
is
redolent
of
water
and
as
the
beer
warms
in
the
glass
it
loses
its
carbonation
with
the
quickness
of
a
cat
and
actually
almost
passes
for
water

finishes
with
a
lingering

for

brave
drinker
draft
minneapolis
had
this
after
washing
the
taste
of
a
labatts
blue
out
of
my
mouth
but
it
was
only
a
slight
improvement
since
this
really
is
my
fathers
beer
that
and
hamms
and
because
it
has
such
a
generic
name
its
a
little
hard
to
approach
without
preconceptions
what
i
find
is
the
usual
pale
american
standard
color
not
much
head
i
did
get
a
hint
of
lager
yeast
taste
but
not
too
much
else
when
we
had
to
leave
i
didnt
really
want
to
stay
and
finish
this
schells
keeps
this
going
because
of
nostalgia
and
name
recognition
as
this
areas
standard
cheap
beer
but
theyd
really
do
well
to
push
more
of
their
own
brand
clear
pale
straw
decent
head
of
short
duration
but
a
left
over
ring
laces
the
glass
slighly
metallic
but
sweet
aroma
light
corn
syrup
malt
indications
the
taste
is
similar
fairly
corn
husk
in
nature
decent
body
sturdier
than
pigs
eye
but
with
flavor
demonstrating
less
fruit
slighly
less
carbonated
late
in
the
profile
than
the
minnesota
brewing
version
to
my
tongue
hops
are
a
little
disappointing
and
sort
of
miller
high
life
typical
a
decent
macro
for
those
who
like
to
support
local
economies
but
wont
stray
from
american
lager
thanks
to
schell
for
preserving
the
brand
it
meets
a
need
schells
may
have
made
this
a
better
beer
just
dont
drink
it
out
of
the
can
rated
from
previous
tasting
notes
its
alright
a
good
choice
if
your
choices
are
few
a
good
cheap
beer
nothing
more
best
beer
in
america
in
canada
very
easy
drinking
and
quality
for
the
style
i
used
to
live
this
stuff
a
long
time
ago
but
aroma
is
of
corn
and
virtually
no
flavor
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
after
working
outside
and
perhaps
slightly
better
than
other
adjunct
lagers
better
than
budweiser
and
every
time
i
partake
in
drinking
this
fine
canadian
offeringi
have
a
yearning
to
watch
slapshot
whats
not
to
like
about
this
beer
good
when
fishing
an
all
day
beer
tastes
great
anytime
fishing
beer
not
much
to
say
just
a
beer
canadas
budweiser
drink
9
of
them
and
play
only
slap
shots
on
a
pond
when
im
not
in
the
mood
to
make
my
stomach
feel
bloated
but
want
a
beer
this
is
a
solid
goto
just
wish
it
was
more
available
in
the
states
since
its
miles
ahead
of
any
macro
we
have
super
tasty
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
tasting
can
of
beer
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
me
great
canadian
beer
good
choice
in
a
hockey
household
standard
fair
bland
lager
great
when
its
very
hot
when
u
are
at
the
beach
light
crisp
goes
flat
quickly
not
as
bad
as
most
mass
produced
soulless
beer
decent
macroswill
for
when
you
just
want
something
simple
and
refreshing
without
a
tidal
wave
of
caustic
hop
bitterness
very
watery
taste
and
feel
only
bud
light
is
worse
simple
not
complicated
and
not
budweiser
compared
to
other
aals
this
isnt
horrible
little
sweet
with
a
kick
of
carbonated
water
on
the
finish
softly
drunk
strong
enough
amazing
taste
stadium
beer
personally
ill
take
it
over
budweiser
coors
or
miller
any
day
clean
tasty
canadian
lager
as
similar
to
american
lagers
in
its
own
way
hard
to
tell
from
labatts
or
moosehead
very
malty
with
no
detectable
hop
flavor
i
guess
you
would
cal
it
well
balanced
but
a
beer
like
samuel
adams
boston
lager
is
much
bolder
and
has
a
good
deal
more
flavor
recommended
for
bud
or
miller
drinkers
in
search
of
slightly
more
flavor
no
bad
attributes
just
a
bit
average
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
but
this
just
drinks
like
bready
vodka
molson
canadian
is
our
national
shame
ive
always
been
found
of
saying
that
no
beer
is
perfect
in
every
occasion
but
every
beer
is
perfect
for
some
occasion
and
molson
canadian
is
suitable
to
only
the
most
desperate
lastditch
circumstances
this
regrettable
lager
is
criminally
overvalued
those
that
drink
this
live
sad
lives
indeed
this
is
one
of
the
better
macro
lagers
it
is
crisp
but
is
limited
on
taste
but
at
least
there
is
a
hint
of
taste
unlike
other
mass
produced
beer
for
those
with
allergies
to
some
of
the
preservatives
commonly
found
in
macro
beers
this
beer
has
no
preservatives
this
beer
is
best
to
drink
while
watching
hockey
i
have
no
idea
why
this
is
the
case
it
just
is
this
is
very
crisp
very
clean
in
its
feel
and
flavor
and
actually
tops
molson
canadian
despite
it
being
an
adjunct
the
adjuncts
are
not
obvious
and
flavor
tends
to
a
more
pilsner
malt
the
corn
seems
absent
the
rice
more
for
smoothness
the
flavor
is
crackery
malt
with
and
easy
dry
crispness
pours
clear
light
golden
color
a
thin
course
head
that
dissipates
completely
in
a
matter
of
seconds
no
lacing
a
sweet
aroma
and
citrusy
flavor
clean
finish
almost
no
aftertaste
a
very
refreshing
brew
even
though
it
lacks
character
overall
a
poor
beer
it
is
drinkable
if
you
get
it
really
cold
but
if
it
heats
up
at
all
i
toss
it
way
too
much
corn
and
rice
but
the
real
kicker
is
the
astringent
flavour
that
is
always
present
overall
3
68
if
i
lived
in
canada
and
i
had
no
alternative
lager
like
rolling
rock
old
style
hauenstein
or
coors
id
grab
this
in
a
heartbeat
it
competes
well
with
all
of
those
brands
which
are
my
favorite
lagers
its
flavorful
sweet
toasty
and
has
a
bit
of
hop
character
not
ashamed
to
drink
this
one
my
favorite
macro
brew
very
nice
lager
with
a
pleasant
hoppy
aftertaste
one
of
the
better
mass
produced
lagers
of
north
america
im
surprised
that
molson
canadian
gets
such
bad
scores
on
ba
compared
to
budweiser
id
have
it
every
day
not
that
bud
is
bad
theyre
both
solid
beers
but
i
prefer
the
molson
as
its
got
a
little
more
bite
to
it
i
find
molson
golden
a
little
bit
below
average
because
its
kind
of
dull
all
around
but
molson
canadian
has
a
nice
malt
to
it
some
decent
herbal
and
grassy
hops
albeit
it
limited
and
a
nice
balance
of
crisp
carbonation
and
firm
bitterness
its
always
clean
and
its
refreshing
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
no
if
you
wanna
drink
molson
go
crab
coors
light
or
molson
export
but
not
this
one
if
you
choosing
between
a
budweiser
or
a
molson
canadian
go
get
a
budweiser
overall
i
am
disapointed
about
that
beer
still
have
19
cans
to
finish
damn
its
gonna
be
hard
good
stuff
overall
honestly
it
is
what
it
is
it
doesnt
taste
great
but
itll
get
you
there
i
call
this
and
beers
like
it
45s
after
the
old
colt
45
slogan
works
every
time
it
has
a
high
enough
abv
and
is
cheap
enough
that
it
will
do
its
job
without
tasting
like
keystone
or
god
forbid
natural
light
so
its
good
for
what
it
is
but
if
you
actually
want
to
drink
beer
for
beers
sake
it
really
isnt
worth
it
bottle
sampled
at
an
edmonton
alberta
restaurant
one
of
those
get
around
to
it
eventually
ticksreviews
and
now
is
eventually
obviously
a
top
seller
across
this
country
although
never
as
big
as
a
few
other
brands
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
this
probably
does
not
deserve
to
be
the
standardbearer
for
john
molsons
rich
brewing
legacy
but
nevertheless
does
manage
to
deliver
more
flavor
than
many
of
its
contemporaries
in
macrolager
land
thin
and
super
fizzy
as
expected
but
does
have
an
almost
buttery
rounded
grain
sweetness
that
comes
off
better
than
in
many
other
takes
on
this
style
less
dms
albeit
this
is
still
present
and
even
a
very
faint
fruitiness
that
recalls
apple
and
grape
hard
candy
dryish
metallic
grainy
finish
you
have
to
focus
to
taste
much
but
whats
there
is
less
rancid
than
expected
workmanlike
lawn
mower
beer
and
has
a
place
at
pizza
parties
postmoving
not
recommended
for
tasting
except
as
an
example
of
a
decent
canadian
macrobrew
for
comparison
purposes
3
55
would
drink
again
overall
i
am
shocked
and
astonished
by
how
much
im
enjoying
this
beer
its
actually
a
decent
quaff
on
its
own
but
for
the
style
its
quite
good
indeed
overall
i
skipped
the
drinking
because
wooo
beer
phase
and
went
straight
to
the
drinking
because
oh
that
looks
interesting
damn
thats
tasty
phase
so
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
beer
of
this
sort
clearly
i
didnt
miss
out
on
much
though
this
is
not
something
i
would
ever
choose
to
drink
its
not
horrible
or
anything
just
very
boring
overall
i
find
nothing
offensive
with
this
brew
but
nothing
exciting
either
conclusion
its
your
typical
north
american
marco
larger
not
the
best
but
not
a
drain
pour
either
i
would
drink
it
again
o
one
of
the
best
midpriced
beers
its
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
if
you
do
make
the
unfortunate
mistake
of
drinking
this
because
your
friend
from
alaska
swears
by
it
do
yourself
a
favor
and
let
it
warm
up
a
little
bit
this
actually
improves
this
bottled
dog
vomit
smooth
easy
drinking
fermented
corn
juice
there
is
too
much
corn
adjunct
in
this
beer
not
that
pleasant
to
drink
overall
a
better
adjunct
lager
than
many
others
out
there
not
overcarbonated
which
plays
well
with
its
flavor
and
drinkability
good
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
picnic
type
foods
in
summer
going
fishing
canoeing
potato
salad
hamburgers
hot
dogs
and
salty
sandwiches
like
pastrami
and
ham
would
all
fare
well
alongside
this
lightly
sweet
beer
this
beer
on
tap
served
sub
zero
is
actually
rather
refreshing
and
enjoyable
but
still
nothing
to
rave
about
mild
hoppy
taste
that
is
grainy
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
but
it
is
more
watery
than
anything
else
a
good
beer
to
get
on
draft
and
to
session
with
the
more
you
drink
this
the
more
tolerable
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
while
at
the
bar
eating
wings
and
spending
the
night
splitting
a
pitcher
with
friends
a
perfect
example
of
how
marketing
can
sell
a
beer
despite
what
the
commercials
say
enjoying
this
beer
does
not
make
you
canadian
o
this
beer
is
nothing
to
phone
home
about
but
i
do
have
to
say
that
it
is
well
worth
the
price
that
i
paid
for
it
when
comparing
molson
to
other
beers
of
the
style
it
is
definitely
centrefield
in
my
mind
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
refreshing
lager
or
a
satisfying
lawnmower
beer
i
recommend
that
you
give
molson
canadian
a
try
if
you
happen
to
pay
20
99
plus
tax
for
a
20
pack
like
i
did
all
the
better
cheers
bros
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
for
a
cold
minnesota
day
a
soso
macro
style
lager
a
notch
better
than
our
us
counterparts
like
bud
and
miller
probably
closest
to
coors
but
less
corn
in
the
flavor
which
is
a
plus
overall
not
especially
good
put
pairs
with
food
well
enough
and
you
can
ignore
it
at
least
ok
this
is
my
goto
beer
even
when
i
worked
in
the
headoffice
of
archenemy
labatts
nothing
to
blow
you
away
just
one
of
the
worlds
very
best
macrobrew
lagers
i
drink
my
beer
lukewarm
which
is
the
real
test
of
flavour
canadian
doesnt
ever
disappoint
it
is
the
exemplar
of
generic
canadian
beer
hoppier
and
punchier
than
any
american
offering
but
not
bitter
like
a
european
brew
its
a
crowd
pleaser
not
one
to
blow
the
socks
off
of
an
afficianado
but
really
if
you
are
out
in
north
america
it
is
a
safe
call
for
a
decent
beer
that
is
readily
commercially
available
funny
enough
it
is
actually
a
premium
brand
in
canada
with
a
premium
pricetag
american
beer
is
cheap
as
dirt
here
with
a
flavour
to
match
i
still
dont
mind
paying
a
little
bit
more
for
quality
simple
fact
is
there
isnt
much
of
a
nose
to
any
canadian
beer
i
mean
really
if
your
wife
has
complained
about
how
you
smell
so
much
like
beer
that
she
wants
some
then
she
is
a
special
lady
canadian
beer
has
a
certain
standard
amount
of
malty
sweetness
that
is
uncharacteristic
of
other
beers
worldwide
but
it
really
adds
to
the
drinkability
factor
i
am
just
more
of
a
massappeal
beer
drinker
than
a
nichemarket
microbrew
kinda
guy
but
for
the
most
part
i
notice
that
my
everyday
beers
are
still
rated
good
for
a
macro
brew
by
even
the
educated
drinkers
amongst
us
i
drink
canadian
warm
for
christsake
and
would
still
reccommend
it
to
anyone
who
will
listen
i
have
had
beers
from
all
over
the
civilized
world
its
comes
down
to
personal
taste
i
personally
like
canadian
belgian
and
danish
beer
in
that
order
that
is
just
me
though
overall
id
have
to
say
im
impressed
with
the
quality
of
this
beer
now
of
course
i
will
need
to
continue
to
purchase
one
every
so

one
of

in

in

top
5
commercial
mainstream
beers
out
there
this
is
a
everyday
drinker
great
beer
for
a
mass
produced
brew
dontcha
know
eh
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
it
makes
you
wish
it
was
hockey
season
molson
ive
had
a
million
of
these
funny
in
us
this
seems
to
be
the
most
popular
variant
while
in
canada
i
feel
molson
export
or
even
molson
dry
is
the
big
money
maker
in
recent
years
at
least
at
any
rate
this
is
a
solid
and
pretty
well
selling
beer
anywhere
in
north
america
pours
a
solid
golden
color
smell
is
pretty
unobtrusive
if
not
entirely
mindblowing
tastes
very
crisp
with
a
kind
of
sweet
finish
rather
than
the
dry
stickiness
i
find
with
budweiser
and
its
ilk
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
in
regards
to
the
style
i
prefer
sleemans
but
now
that
i
no
longer
live
in
canada
ill
take
what
i
can
get
the
definitive
b
brew
molson
is
a
damn
fine
beer
year
round
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
ive
had
draft
bottled
and
canned
that
is
best
canned
its
a
great
summer
beer
if
youre
looking
to
throw
back
with
old
friends
and
get
wasted
lol
cheap
price
but
decent
brew
it
is
almost
sweet
lots
of
flavor
and
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
all
in
all
a
beer
i
recommend
o
ive
had
far
worse
macro
lagers
than
this
and
ive
even
had
worse
craft
beers
than
this
too
this
is
perfectly
okay
if
not
exactly
good
i
can
now
see
where
some
of
you
canadians
are
coming
from
this
blows
our
bmc
out
of
the
water
hell
id
even
drink
this
again
like
just
about
all
american
adjunct
lagers
molson
canadian
failed
to
blow
me
away
for
the
style
however
this
beer
was
pretty
solid
overall
very
surprised
with
the
very
low
carbonation
its
not
a
good
beer
but
it
does
its
job
well
quenching
your
thirst
that
is
inoffensive
and
better
than
others
in
the
style
but
really
just
non
descript
overall
good
fishing
beer
but
the
beer
itself
is
okay
its
got
a
lot
of
corny
taste
but
some
nice
wheat
notes
as
well
the
flavour
is
pretty
potent
for
a
beer
of
its
type
but
not
terribly
offensive
either
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
the
typical
swill
that
canadians
who
are
not
desparate
enough
to
buy
lucky
lager
will
get
if
its
on
sale
cheap
beer
purchased
at
mejiers
in
canton
mi
oit
doesnt
taste
bad
its
just
completely
boring
it
is
very
drinkable
of
course
yuengling
wouldve
been
the
better
choice
in
addition
to
my
overall
rating
of
this
beer
being
very
poor
cheap
and
low
quality
i
also
want
to
make
mention
that
after
drinking
this
molson
product
it
is
also
appears
that
it
is
loaded
with
preservatives
again
another
reason
why
i
choose
to
avoid
low
quality
products
such
as
this
a
very
disappointing
experience
all
in
all
and
has
reinforced
why
i
generally
avoid
mass
produced
canadian
beer
products
if
what
your
looking
for
in
a
beer
is
very
simple
with
the
main
characteristics
of
cold
crisp
and
refreshing
then
this
beer
is
for
you
this
beer
is
served
best
on
tap
in
canada
it
really
brings
it
all
together
this
beer
does
not
have
many
specialties
it
is
just
you
common
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
simple
cold
crisp
refreshing
beer
than
this
is
the
beer
for
you
please
try
this
beer
on
tap
and
in
the
country
where
it
is
brewed
there
is
something
about
drinking
the
beer
in
canada
that
makes
it
that
much
better
this
is
the
beer
to
grab
when
you
do
not
want
to
mess
around
with
too
many
frills
o
although
this
beer
isnt
that
flavorful
its
definitely
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
overall
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
it
is
not
great
i
prefer
this
one
over
many
others
of
the
aal
variety
i
am
a
sucker
for
this
beer
during
hockey
season
makes
the
hockeywatching
experience
feel
complete
its
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
but
its
not
the
worst
investment
o
horrible
drinkability
standard
mass
production
adjunct
lager
dont
drink
it
there
was
a
time
decades
ago
where
i
rather
liked
molson
but
then
there
werent
many
other
choices
for
exotic
beers
then
i
guess
i
havent
really
missed
anything
in
through
the
intervening
years
rather
subpar
even
for
an
adjunct
lager
this
would
do
in
a
pinch
but
would
rather
scope
out
a
budweiser
or
strohs
beer
if
this
were
the
style
i
had
to
drink
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
o
very
enjoyable
tasting
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
drinking
or
session
beer
this
beer
has
more
of
a
flavor
profile
than
bmc
and
should
be
sought
out
if
you
need
an
enjoyable
session
beer
keep
in
mind
what
style
of
beer
this
is
when
you
try
it
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
is
a
crystal
clear
light
straw
color
thin
snow
white
head
that
huddles
around
inside
of
the
rim
aroma
is
cooked
vegetable
like
and
buttery
a
lightly
sweet
floral
taste
is
what
i
experienced
foremost
everything
is
very
light
not
much
bitterness
to
speak
of
has
a
light
tingly
feel
with
a
dry
finish
not
special
but
much
better
than
alot
of
offerings
from
this
category
would
be
a
good
option
poolside
in
the
summer
o
canada
and
so
on
and
so
forth
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
wheat
and
a
tiny
bit
of
sweet
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
sweetness
really
taking
control
of
the
proceedings
a
light
bit
of
macro
funk
spews
forth
every
now
and
again
to
remind
you
of
who
made
this
stuff
i
wanna
know
what
they
douse
to
create
that
character
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
fairly
meek
little
beer
but
one
of
the
better
more
tolerable
adjunct
lagers
out
there
overall
for
an
adjunct
this
is
not
one
i
would
likely
go
for
it
is
drinkable
but
not
anything
i
would
like
to
drink
on
any
occasion
well
its
not
a
very
good
beer
i
was
surprised
to
find
no
hints
of
skunk
though
probably
due
to
the
can
i
cant
really
get
into
specifics
about
the
smell
and
taste
because
it
really
is
your
typical
adjunct
fare
rather
than
being
corn
dominant
though
i
feel
like
theres
some
actual
malt
in
molson
theres
nothing
special
about
it
all
per
se
but
its
a
respectable
cheap
adjunct
that
id
take
any
day
especially
at
the
same
price
as
budweiser
and
such
over
some
others
of
the
style
as
ive
already
said
several
times
o
ill
finish
it
but
that
funkiness
is
definitely
a
problem
i
was
in
owen
sound
canada
a
few
years
back
and
i
had
several
molson
canadians
which
i
thought
were
outstanding
i
thought
i
would
buy
a
case
down
here
in
the
states
and
the
beer
purchased
in
the
states
is
nothing
like
the
molson
canadian
in
canada
its
not
even
close
the
case
of
beer
that
i
bought
just
a
week
ago
had
a
promo
called
only
one
is
worthy
of
the
cup
and
when
i
tried
to
register
it
said
the
contest
expired
in
june
of
2012
which
means
the
beer
is
almost
six
months
old
maybe
older
its
very
weak
and
watery
and
tastes
like
a
light
beer
thats
why
canadian
is
getting
a
5
star
review
from
me
its
the
best
of
what
it
is
if
you
dont
even
want
to
consider
that
then
go
listen
to
bon
iver
and
leave
me
alone
the
beer
tastes
like
grain
corn
at
first
rice
later
i
suspect
are
adjunct
ingredients
of
the
beer
it
does
have
a
touch
of
a
metallic
feel
but
overall
it
is
a
better
than
average
commercial
lager
with
good
taste
lively
carbonation
and
a
nice
crisp
mouth
feel
this
beer
is
obviously
not
a
delicacy
its
a
session
beer
that
is
best
consumed
at
a
cold
temperature
and
while
wearing
a
concert
shirt
pours
a
clear
straw
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
slight
hops
slight
sweet
malt
pale
malt
adjuncts
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
adjunct
pale
malt
slight
hops
and
slight
sweet
malt
overall
an
average
adjunct
lager
with
a
decent
appearance
ive
had
many
beers
both
lagers
and
ales
from
porters
dunkels
stouts
tripels
l
sorts
of
lagers
and
much
more
not
a
big
fan
of
many
lagers
mostly
an
ale
guy
prefer
nourishing
beers
over
quenching
beers
i
like
topfermenting
brews
more
so
than
bottomfermenting
brews
to
me
this
lager
is
not
too
much
of
my
liking
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
taste
to
it
yes
its
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
it
just
doesnt
have
much
to
it
o
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
beer
exactly
but
theres
something
about
it
that
just
seems
higherquality
than
others
its
related
to
nothing
spectacular
but
if
you
just
want
something
you
can
take
in
quantity
to
a
gettogether
or
a
night
of
hockeywatching
thats
a
little
better
than
average
but
not
too
expensive
this
is
it
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
pass
it
was
fitting
then
that
me
canad
canad
should
get
reacquainted
at
an
open
air
iron
maiden
concert
a
few
weeks
back
molson
ampitheatre
torona
ontario
run
to
the
hills
there
wasnt
much
choice
in
the
matter
serving
type
draft
in
a
very
large
plastic
cup
not
unlike
a
big
gulp
smell
didnt
taste
soapy
astringent
suds
unclean
lines
and
not
as
cold
as
it
ought
to
have
been
mouthfeel
didnt
let
it
linger
to
get
the
feel
understand
i
was
not
expecting
so
much
but
it
oozed
under
the
bar
somehow
i
did
finish
it
however
o
not
too
bad
i
would
take
over
a
bmc
but
not
over
a
yuengling
overall
it
is
actually
a
decent
beer
actually
not
bad
would
be
a
better
descriptor
it
is
certainly
a
drinkable
session
beer
but
for
that
price
you
can
easily
get
a
much
better
alternative
its
drawbacks
are
the
syrupy
taste
and
offputting
aftertaste
the
amazing
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
tastes
the
same
cold
as
it
does
warm
today
this
beer
poured
very
wellhad
a
very
cleanblonde
appearance
and
a
good
effervescence
energy
consequently
the
odor
too
was
very
freshand
the
taste
did
not
disappoint
a
sweet
malty
bready
flavor
and
yet
not
heavy
or
skunky
after
taste
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
really
cooled
off
a
hot
afternoon
by
the
pool
i
would
recommned
anytime
and
anywherehowever
molson
canadian
the
flagship
beer
of
corporate
canada
only
sampled
when
choices
are
limited
a
pale
lager
with
very
little
distinction
pours
well
and
looks
appealing
but
leaves
much
to
be
desired
often
is
accompanied
with
a
borderline
unpleasant
lingering
on
the
palate
tastes
much
better
when
you
have
the
distinct
pleasure
of
buying
them
at
8
a
piece
in
plastic
cups
at
hockey
games
poured
from
a
can
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
very
little
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
continuing
to
rise
to
the
top
even
well
into
drinking
the
beer
leaves
trace
amounts
of
lacing
pretty
average
for
the
style
smells
strongly
of
wet
bread
with
some
rice
grains
and
nothing
else
once
again
average
of
the
style
the
taste
is
filled
with
stale
bread
and
skunkiness
perhaps
slightly
better
than
your
average
aal
but
not
by
much
the
mouthfeel
follows
the
taste
but
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
1
5
d
another
terrible
example
of
a
terrible
style
good
for
thirst
not
that
great
for
taste
too
much
soda
character
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
goes
away
rather
quickly
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
macro
grain
possibly
corn
and
minimal
malt
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
a
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
overall
it
is
not
a
horrible
macro
beer
and
better
than
the
ones
south
of
the
border
when
i
think
back
to
what
kickstarted
my
interest
in
craft
beer
molson
canadian
is
one
of
three
beers
that
comes
to
my
mind
i
will
save
these
for
my
400th
and
500th
review
anyway
when
i
first
had
molson
canadian
it
was
remarkably
better
than
the
crap
i
had
tasted
up
to
that
point
honestly
its
not
that
great
and
it
isnt
as
good
as
narragansett
lager
but
it
is
worth
a
try
this
is
a
decent
sessionable
lager
its
not
overly
flavorful
but
its
not
offensive
in
any
way
either
its
clean
and
refreshing
i
would
have
this
again
overall
a
good
beer
to
drink
while
watching
the
grill
very
very
drinkable
this
is
not
a
beer
advocates
dream
but
on
a
comparative
basis
to
other
adjunct
lagers
this
one
tastes
good
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
simply
an
average
nothing
special
aal
bbq
beer
as
i
like
to
call
it
crisp
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
yet
pretty
tasteless
ah
the
pride
of
canada
right
pours
golden
copper
with
small
white
head
aroma
is
light
sweet
malt
a
little
biscuit
and
corn
flavor
follows
with
light
sweetness
a
bit
of
biscuit
and
some
light
hops
and
hay
to
go
along
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
little
dirty
on
the
finish
with
adequate
to
mediumhigh
carbonation
better
than
bud
light
i
guess
stadium
beer
pours
a
corn
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
turns
to
nothing
smells
like
a
frat
house
better
than
a
budlight
but
not
by
much
this
beer
is
at
every
sports
event
there
is
and
it
can
be
decent
after
a
hockey
game
but
its
just
another
mass
produced
lager
taste
isnt
bad
doesnt
taste
like
the
container
it
was
served
from
which
is
a
plus
light
feel
good
carbonation
makes
this
an
easy
drinker
especialy
when
its
cold
better
than
the
other
beers
in
its
price
range
i
cant
hate
this
too
bad
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
these
are
all
the
same
not
sure
why
its
my
old
mans
go
to
but
it
still
is
nothing
distinct
no
hop
presence
dectable
and
very
approachable
whatever
kind
of
drink
for
me
o
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
to
have
an
appreciation
for
this
isnt
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
session
beer
that
you
can
slam
down
a
12pack
of
and
get
buzzed
up
given
its
above
average
abv
for
the
style
this
would
be
a
decent
pick
for
that
purpose
i
give
a
schlitz
for
molson
canadian
and
this
time
around
its
an
apples
to
apples
comparison
not
great
but
not
terrible
either
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
and
not
complaining
too
much
first
canadian
lager
for
me
57
for
a
six
pack
can
hardly
compete
with
similar
tasting
beers
definitely
could
drink
higher
quantities
of
this
stuff
molson
canadian
is
like
most
typical
north
american
beers
it
pours
a
golden
clear
with
initial
big
head
that
dissapates
quickly
the
smell
and
taste
are
mostly
grain
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
drinkable
very
light
and
refreshing
has
a
distinct
sweetness
about
it
dry
and
especially
crisp
a
bit
watery
but
after
a
long
hot
day
working
outside
in
the
heat
in
florida
it
goes
down
smooth
hey
i
need
to
put
down
this
crap
im
drinking
and
go
and
get
a
box
of
this
stuff
overall
i
am
a
little
disappointed
not
because
of
how
it
tastes
or
smells
but
because
of
its
lack
of
taste
and
smell
it
reminds
me
almost
exactly
of
michelob
ultra
and
this
isnt
even
a
light
beer
for
imported
adjunct
lagers
id
rather
go
with
fosters
this
is
too
much
like
light
beer
i
sort
of
feel
cheated
i
drink
this
when
i
visit
my
boyfriends
family
in
canada
and
its
fit
for
purpose
its
light
yellow
in
color
smells
vaguely
sweetish
and
has
no
flavor
to
which
one
could
object
very
light
body
i
suppose
i
detected
one
but
good
carbonation
o
canada
rjt
on
tap
at
a
bar
over
by
north
station
served
in
a
regular
pint
glass
bright
yellow
colored
body
fluffy
foamy
white
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
admittedly
a
decent
looking
lager
smell
was
absent
taste
was
mostly
just
a
jumble
of
adjunct
product
flavors
mouthfeel
was
on
the
crisp
side
and
it
was
fairly
smooth
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
it
goes
down
fairly
easily
the
only
reason
i
ordered
it
was
that
i
hadnt
had
a
molson
in
years
so
now
i
have
and
i
probably
wont
again
anytime
soon
its
a
hockey
arena
cheapo
plastic
cup
beer
and
nothing
more
good
for
days
when
you
know
you
will
drink
more
than
you
should
light
clean
crisp
mild
taste
nary
a
hope
to
be
found
taste
drops
off
at
the
end
easy
drinker
better
than
us
macros
but
not
remarkable
o
this
is
a
mediocre
pale
lager
one
that
i
would
only
consume
if
i
had
no
other
options
its
better
than
many
other
mainstream
lagers
though
still
there
are
better
options
out
there
and
theres
no
point
in
wasting
time
on
beers
like
this
o
goes
down
ok
mildly
tasty
not
filling
expected
kick
for
the
style
a
nice
adaptation
of
the
style
a
decent
alternative
to
bmc
products
but
on
an
every
day
basis
not
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
overall
drinkability
truly
a
once
in
a
lifetime
beer
and
by
that
i
mean
im
not
planning
on
buying
it
again
light
only
slightly
flavorful
and
mostly
inoffensive
basically
an
imported
budweiser
o
overall
nonoffensive
flavor
easy
enough
drinkability
if
your
into
the
style
or
not
rather
clean
even
when
warmed
up
when
compared
to
south
of
the
border
examples
overall
this
is
my
go
to
cheap
beer
doesnt
have
as
much
of
that
weird
canadian
beer
taste
as
labatt
but
is
sitll
very
crisp
o
overall
while
far
from
my
favorite
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
for
what
it
is
i
bought
a
24
pack
of
this
that
was
on
sale
for
a
little
get
together
i
hosted
recently
and
it
went
over
big
with
my
noncraft
friends
for
what
thats
worth
while
you
can
definitely
find
worse
for
the
price
im
not
sure
if
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
if
something
else
were
available
mcl
sets
itself
apart
from
most
u
s
macro
adjunctspale
lagers
and
canadas
labatt
blue
shouldnt
even
be
mentioned
in
the
same
sentence
edit
edit
still
not
as
good
as
narragansetts
interpretation
of
the
style
o
a
good
basic
lager
should
be
considered
a
epl
instead
of
a
aal
perhaps
the
best
attribute
of
this
brew
is
its
crisp
finish
that
leaves
hardly
any
aftertaste
it
is
light
bodied
and
modestly
carbonated
clearly
this
is
a
beer
to
be
consumed
as
cold
as
possible
for
maximum
enjoyment
with
a
numbed
sense
of
smell
and
taste
as
this
brew
got
warm
it
became
a
burden
sitting
here
trying
to
enjoy
something
with
flavor
and
aroma
is
a
failure
it
does
however
fit
the
bill
of
an
adjunct
brew
and
it
is
for
the
most
part
without
fault
this
isnt
something
that
i
would
purchase
if
given
options
however
i
will
admit
that
in
my
years
between
the
age
of
16
and
20
i
consumed
a
metric
shit
ton
of
this
as
well
as
yuengling
sitting
here
tonight
i
am
thankful
i
have
seen
the
light
of
what
quality
beer
really
is
pours
a
clear
light
straw
yellow
with
a
2
finger
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
smells
of
boiled
corn
water
and
lager
funk
typical
for
an
aal
grainy
and
sweet
and
clean
light
crisp
refreshing
watered
down
overall
its
an
aal
thats
smack
dab
in
the
middle
taste
good
enough
to
be
with
the
best
of
em
but
bad
enough
to
be
with
the
worst
of
em
overall
i
have
to
give
the
canadians
credit
they
make
a
solid
adjunct
lager
its
got
enough
nuanced
flavor
to
be
interesting
but
still
carries
that
distinct
adjuncty
flair
to
make
it
go
down
with
ease
and
repetition
d
probably
my
favorite
macrolager
right
now
its
not
fantastic
but
i
never
find
it
unenjoyable
or
offensive
in
any
way
its
a
simple
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
feel
to
it
final
grade
3
18
a
c
o
this
is
a
light
beer
for
sure
its
drinkable
but
not
intriguing
or
memorable
not
my
style
not
my
style
at
all
ive
been
on
a
cheap
beer
kick
lately
and
while
theyre
all
relatively
similar
pbr
bud
highlife
etc
i
think
molson
canadian
takes
the
cake
thus
far
o
theres
certainly
better
canadian
beers
to
buy
but
i
would
never
turn
one
down
i
wish
this
wasnt
one
of
the
top
canadian
exports
but
im
inclined
to
think
it
might
be
youll
need
to
come
to
canada
to
see
what
we
really
have
to
offer
pours
a
pale
goldenyellow
fizzy
with
a
quicklydissipating
finger
or
two
of
bubbly
white
head
smell
of
old
grains
sweet
corn
and
similar
taste
with
plenty
of
funk
and
skunk
stale
rotten
garbage
aftertaste
very
light
and
very
undrinkable
probably
worse
than
most
us
adjunct
beers
the
ice
is
slightly
better
o
good
session
beer
especially
if
your
going
to
mow
down
some
heavy
appetizers
or
tailgate
food
the
beer
is
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
bubbles
rising
and
a
foamy
white
head
that
hung
around
and
left
a
lot
of
lacing
it
smells
of
hay
lemon
and
skunk
the
taste
is
a
bit
mettalic
with
some
other
grassy
and
bready
flavors
feels
a
bit
watery
with
carbonation
that
stings
the
tongue
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
beer
is
better
than
american
macros
and
i
would
drink
it
again
its
very
easy
drinking
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
small
dryness
with
a
corn
like
sweet
malt
a
small
bite
and
thin
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
to
a
clean
aftertaste
quite
thin
and
lacking
flavor
and
aroma
o
this
still
remains
to
be
my
favorite
macro
i
think
im
just
biased
to
the
taste
since
this
was
usually
what
id
drink
before
i
discovered
craft
beer
well
its
not
my
favorite
beer
but
could
be
bought
for
a
party
beer
if
you
dont
want
to
spend
a
lot
and
want
to
bring
beer
everyone
will
enjoy
it
is
definetely
the
best
tasting
beer
from
molson
that
i
have
had
so
far
another
adjunct
lager
such
a
bummer
the
color
is
the
standard
yellow
brew
with
a
little
head
on
it
quickly
fades
this
beer
isnt
skunky
which
is
awesome
its
rather
pleasant
to
drink
this
beer
is
one
of
the
better
generic
beers
from
canada
its
much
better
than
xxx
from
them
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
and
crips
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavours
and
aromas
its
an
overall
worthy

nice

well
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
there
are
many
better
beers
out
there
d
i
am
thinking
summer
over
70
degrees
light
and
refreshing
pours
a
stunningly
clear
yellow
a
pillowy
head
stays
around
for
a
while
smell
is
granddads
classic
beer
smell
which
is
to
say
slightly
sweet
biscuity
malts
and
slightly
bitter
hops
taste
is
a
little
less
impressive
most
of
the
quality
is
muted
and
a
tin
taste
comes
into
play
finishes
minerally
and
almost
too
bitter
feel
is
slick
and
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
drinks
ok
this
one
appeared
better
than
what
it
tasted
imo
light
bodied
average
carbonation
very
generic
not
worth
trying
again
this
stuff
is
great
its
one
of
those
market
beers
you
get
for
the
fridge
or
for
a
good
time
super
refreshing
just
like
its
canadian
friend
moosehead
and
easy
to
drink
not
much
to
say
just
go
buy
it
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
medium
bodied
and
finetuned
taste
i
was
impressed
with
this
lager
it
isnt
just
another
a
a
l
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
it
makes
me
want
to
go
ahhhh
after
every
drink
a
fair
canadian
brew
basically
canadas
budweiser
passing
grade
but
not
the
best
a
fizzy
yellow
pour
crystal
clear
and
so
are
the
sides
of
my
glass
unobstructed
by
any
lacing
not
a
good
start
smell
is
sweet
light
corn
and
a
little
grassiness
taste
is
grainy
and
sweet
some
corn
again
better
than
a
lot
of
adjunct
lagers
fizzy
and
dry
on
the
tongue
drinkability
in
that
you
could
drink
a
lot
if
you
had
to
dont
think
i
want
to
drink
great
quantities
of
any
adjunct
lager
though
i
am
slightly
embarrassed
that
this
is
one
of
the
beers
people
from
outside
canada
tend
to
think
is
indicative
of
what
canada
has
to
offer
same
goes
for
most
of
what
molson
and
labatt
have
to
offer
doesnt
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
step
above
a
light
beer
with
the
weight
of
many
a
normal
beer
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
plan
on
having
quite
a
few
this
wont
weigh
you
down
but
doesnt
completely
cut
out
flavor
still
drinkability
is
surprisingly
to
me
down
the
middle
and
its
surprisingly
not
as
bad
as
i
remember
it
but
not
the
beer
i
want
to
drink
at
anytime
since
there
is
so
much
better
to
be
had
d
this
would
have
to
be
my
favorite
macro
lager
ive
spent
plenty
of
saturdays
at
the
bar
drinking
pitcher
of
canadian
never
lets
you
down
so
this
is
canadian
beer
ehh
this
canadian
lager
pours
a
pale
yellowish
color
with
the
scent
of
cheap
grains
and
malts
there
is
grains
in
the
taste
as
well
as
hints
of
citrus
not
a
terrible
in
taste
its
just
really
weak
with
little
taste
and
no
volume
to
it
considering
the
costs
and
taste
miller
or
bud
would
be
a
better
pick
as
far
as
drinkability
i
think
its
one
of
the
best
regular
lager
beers
that
north
america
offers
from
our
freinds
up
in
canada
a
great
beer
if
you
plan
on
drinking
quite
a
few
beers
and
dont
want
a
whole
lot
of
that
annoying
fizzy
adjuct
taste
thats
found
in
lot
of
mass
produced
beer
brands
while
this
is
better
than
other
massproduced
pale
lagers
ive
had
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
as
a
beer
pick
it
up
if
its
being
put
up
against
the
likes
of
pbr
bud
etc
or
light
beers
avoid
otherwise
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
not
a
great
beer
however
for
an
aal
i
think
this
may
be
the
best
one
ive
had
yet
compared
to
the
big
breweries
aals
which
are
the
only
aals
ive
had
before
unimpressive
all
around
but
surprising
in
the
taste
goes
down
easy
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
if
offered
id
drink
it
aroma
and
taste
are
mainly
of
grains
and
corn
nothing
much
to
write
about
regarding
taste
and
aroma
decent
carbonation
and
lacing
along
the
glass
fairly
flat
taste
wise
does
good
at
quenching
thirst
and
thats
about
it
perfect
pairing
with
chips
and
pizza
decent
beer
for
a
hot
day
d
couldnt
drink
this
often
d
for
the
most
part
this
is
your
average
easy
drinking
macro
lager
with
a
taste
that
seems
better
than
most
from
the
style
making
it
a
decent
no
thought
just
a
beer
beer
dr
nice
but
a
bit
pricey
will
satisfy
lager
fans
easy
drinker
prolly
one
of
the
better
macros
out
there
but
still
average
swill
i
had
a
pbr
afterwords
and
it
was
heavenly
compared
to
molson
i
could
taste
things
at
the
kitchenerwaterloo
oktoberfest
and
the
beer
choices
were
canadian
or
coors
light
i
suppose
this
was
the
best
choice
though
not
a
good
choice
poured
a
straw
yellow
without
any
head
or
lacing
smells
slightly
metallic
grassy
and
some
malt
flavour
is
almost
nonexistent
way
too
carbonated
to
go
down
easy
i
had
to
drink
several
of
these
as
it
was
the
only
option
couldnt
handle
sipping
it
much
so
whenever
possible
i
got
into
chugging
competition
and
drinking
games
that
allowed
me
to
down
the
beer
in
a
few
seconds
btw
great
for
shotgunning
very
high
its
whole
lot
better
than
coors
bud
and
miller
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
so
the
other
5
bottles
wont
be
a
chore
to
drink
ive
had
this
beer
in
a
variety
of
formats
though
on
this
night
i
drink
from
the
bottle
pours
a
yellowy
orange
with
very
littlehead
drinks
okay
i
pick
up
on
the
barley
a
bit
leaves
no
very
little
to
no
lacing
as
far
as
macrobrewery
lagers
go
this
is
okay
overall
i
think
it
was
ok
compared
to
my
last
beer
of
the
night
but
do
not
think
i
will
be
doing
this
one
again
molson
canadian
pours
a
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
thin
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
very
grainy
the
flavour
is
much
the
same
with
some
light
fruitness
there
is
not
much
too
it
but
nothing
objectionable
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
with
a
slight
lingering
astringency
d
best
when
served
cold
at
least
it
is
a
step
up
from
the
light
beers
its
pretty
tasty
actually
the
label
says
that
this
beer
is
the
best
canada
has
to
offer
a
bit
sour
with
cheap
vodka
alcohol
flavors
the
alcohol
flavor
should
be
easy
to
hide
but
it
comes
right
to
the
front
in
this
beer
because
there
are
virtually
no
offsetting
flavors
there
is
a
time
and
a
place
for
all

already
better
than

beers
the
beer
was
light
id
take
the
american
alternative
we
wash
our

with

only
chose
this
to
enjoy
the

is
my
favorite
canadian
macro
lager
being
a
frenchcanadian
this
was
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
bubbly
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
two
finger
head
the
head
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
has
a
clean
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
smell
tastes
similar
to
many
other
mass
produced
lagers
tastes
a
little
grainy
with
light
sweet
flavors
kind
of
a
watery
finish
not
bad
though
notes
this
beer
is
not
the
best
beer
ever
however
for
an
adjunct
lager
id
say
its
pretty
good
i
would
much
rather
have
this
over
any
bmc
product
it
has
a
little
uniqueness
to
it
that
american
adjuncts
dont
have
even
if
it
is
only
the
result
of
different
adjuncts
i
still
like
it
better
this
is
my
favorite
beer
to
have
while
at
a
hockey
game
overall
i
can
see
why
someone
might
reach
for
this
if
theyre
in
the
mood
for
a
simple
brew
that
refreshes
the
palate
canadian
is
not
a
good
beer
but
for
a
weak
ass
mega
lager
it
surpasses
expectations
worth
a
try
if
your
options
are
limited
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
as
good
as
or
better
than
any
of
the
similarlypriced
bmc
products
bud
mgd
or
coors
original
highly
recommended
this
is
one
of
those
lagers
that
you
can
really
put
down
but
for
pure
enjoyment
it
is
not
a
good
choice
this
is
i
think
a
session
beer
where
if
your
at
a
bar
you
can
definalty
put
a
few
of
these
down
with
out
getting
sick
of
it
my
brother
in
law
is
a
fan
of
this
yet
he
is
not
a
fan
of
bud
cause
there
really
isnt
much
of
a
difference
between
the
two
other
then
the
taste
of
molson
being
a
little
bit
better
then
bud
if
you
decided
to
drink
it
it
wont
be
to
much
of
a
disappointment
but
still
i
would
go
for
something
with
a
little
bit
more
taste
then
this
one
d
i
have
no
desire
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
belongs
in
the
class
with
the
majority
of
macro
offerings
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
little
bit
of
head
that
goes
away
this
is
one
of
those
cheap
gets
the
job
done
kind
beers
it
is
a
nice
smooth
medium
bodied
lager
light
alcohol
flavor
and
very
decently
malty
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fizzy
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
golden

profile
is
the
same
lacking
in
character
imo
one
of
the
blandest
beers
ive
ever
had
upon
reflection
i
should
have
had
a
glass
of
wine
instead
of
taking
papis
last
beer
as
i
read
fellow
advocate
reviews
on
this
beer
i
am
actually
finding
myself
enjoying
this
fine
brew
from
our
neighbors
up
north
i
cant
say
i
relate
to
the
hockey
connection
being
a
football
guy
but
i
tell
you
whatthis
is
reminding
me
a
whole
lot
of
falstaff
back
in
the
70s
and
that
was
me
and
my
dads
favorite
beer
not
the
best
canada
has
to
offer
but
certainly
not
bad
pale

a
good

good
carbonation
sweet

a
crisp

good
taste
for
the
style
a
nice

if
your
out
and
want
something
different

one
can
go
all
night
and
not
get
boring
poured
from
a
bottle
into

12
packs
of
molson
were
on
sale
so
i
figured
id
try
the
one
not
in
the
green
bottle
its
not
bad
for
a
quick
thirst
quencher
or
something
to
drink
while
watching
the
game
not
what
i
want
people
to
think
of
when
they
hear
canadian
beer
this
beer
looks
better
then
it
is
dont
go
looking
this
one
i
doubt
you
would
have
too
look
far
anyways
ok
this
isnt
horrible
better
than

my

review
beer
is
good
value
for
the
price
nice
flavor
and
for
the
style
of
american
adjunct
very
on
point
and
i
rate
it
against
style
for
6
49
for
6
pack
would
visit
again
as
i
have
in
the
past
while
drinking
this
beeri
noticed
it
is
now
brewed
by
coors
in
americaand
even
says
in
very
small
print
product
of
u
s
a
anyway
it
looks
fine
pretty
much
like
most
american
adjunct
lagers
sort
of
a
clear
straw
color
however
the
smell
is
very
oddand
not
in
a
good
wayalmost
like
moldy
corn
that
has
souredalso
some
chemical
notesand
just
plain
nasty
to
be
honestthe
taste
is
not
as
bad
as
the
smell
however
you
get
a
ton
of
cornand
pick
up
some
of
that
moldy
corn
flavorand
a
light
chemical
taste
you
really
have
chill
this
beer
downjust
as
you
would
a
malt
liquor
and
drink
em
fastbecause
when
it
warms
all
those
moldychemicaland
off
flavors
become
even
strongerwould
i
buy
this
beer
again
no
however
i
have
had
much
worseand
it
is
drinkable
to
a
degreebut
a
chugging
beer
all
the
wayyou
really
do
not
want
to
savor
a
beer
this
badcheers
pours
a
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
good
12
finger
white
fizzyfoamy
head
that
finally
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
after
about
10
minutes
or
so
some
spotyy
lacing
is
seen
that
stuck
to
the
glass
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
hops
and
sweet
corn
pretty
much
the
same
is
said
for
the
taste
starts
out
a
bit
dry
and
finishes
with
a
slight
bitter
taste
lighter
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
was
just
ok
but
not
a
big
deal
just
a
one
time
deal
for
me
ok
beer
will
drink

id
say
go
and
try
this
if
youre

not

on

and
its

definitely
not
deserving
of
its
poor
rating
thats
reserved
for

for
crying
out

get
some
overall
this
beer
is
not
horrible
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
flavor
but
that
means
its
not
disgusting
just
kind
of
blah
overall
a
good
adjunct
lager
with
some
softer
mouthfeel
but
still
uninspiring
flavor
profile
score
are
based
on
to
style
rating
molson
ice
is
an
ice
brew
with
an
abv
of
5
6
not
a
bad
brew
the
taste
is
ok
reminds
me
a
of
budweiser
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
the
brew
is
smooth
but
it
has
a
kick
this
brew
is
better
than
what
i
thought
it
would
be
i
will
be
buying
this
this
brew
to
change
it
it
for
the
the
american
style
lagers
itll
get
you
drunk
and
youll
regret
drinking
it
in
the
morning
overall
its
another
mainstream
beer
that
is
easily
confused
with
all
the
others
bit
better
than
some
of
the
competition
i
suppose
molson
ice
is
a
decently
flavorful
adjunct
lager
but
pretty
rough
around
the
edges
if
i
had
to
chose
i
would
much
prefer
molsons
canadian
lager
to
this
so
called
ice
beer
its
kinda
harsh
but
sometimes
thats
what
youre
looking
for
o
like
pretty
much
every
ice
beer
it
just
cant
stand
up
to
the
regular
version
it
sprang
from
the
colder
the
better
to
match
the
ice
in
the
game
youre
watching
that
inspired
you
to
buy
it
o
overall
probably
the
best
aal
that
i
have
ever
had
perfectly
balanced
easy
drinking
and
very
sessionable
even
my
summer
shandy
loving
girlfriend
liked
it
so
thats
a
bonus
overall
well
nothing
really
all
that
fantastic
and
definitely
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
for
50
cents
a
bottle
thought
you
cant
expect
too
much
and
it
could
be
good
for
a
party
style
brew
i
suppose
lets
rock
some
ice
folks
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
corn
mineral
water
sweet
flowers
and
a
kiss
of
wheat
the
taste
holds
notes
of
hard
water
light
tin
funky
wheat
light
powdered
sugar
and
mild
corn
theres
an
off
taste
in
there
somewhere
it
moves
around
all
heisenbergian
and
whatnot
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
kinda
sad
little
beer
but
one
that
thankfully
isnt
entirely
offensive
do
yourself
a
favor
and
just
skip
this
beer
i
will
from
now
on
im
pretty
sure
now
that
labatt
ice
is
the
better
ice
beer
of
the
two
from
what
i
remember
after
retrying
this
soon
enough
though
i
will
be
giving
labatt
ice
another
shot
and
maybe
post
a
review
of
it
for
completeness
reasons
when
i
think
of
ice
beers
i
think
of
my
trip
to
montreal
4
years
ago
bring
clueless
about
beer
and
buying
all
the
repulsive
9
lagers
this
one
obviously
wasnt
great
but
for
this
style
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
and
not
really
harsh
in
the
least
you
can
certainly
drink
worse
1
5
d
this
is
bad
by
aal
standards
dont
know
how
im
gonna
finish
this
overall
just
an
average
beer
simple
drinking
nothing
to
really
think
about
my
guess
is
not
many
people
are
drinking
an
ice
beer
to
be
wowed
by
complexities
in
the
first
place
cheers
cheers
o
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
would
never
buy
this
of
my
own
volition
but
if
somebody
offered
me
one
i
wouldnt
refuse
rjt
better
than
other
ice
beers
that
ive
had
notably
keystone
over
the
years
pretty
good
at
a
bbq
and
if
in
a
bottle
wont
have
that
metallic
taste
which
is
common
with
canned
beers
is
it
still
available
ive
never
seen
it
here
in
texas
last
had
it
while
in
california
somehow
this
is
better
than
other
molson
products
not
that
i
drink
it
but
i
used
to
back
in
the
day
pours
a
pale
goldenyellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
doesnt
linger
long
light
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
corn
some
grain
sweetness
mainly
in
the
taste
fading
to
a
bit
of
what
could
almost
be
hop
bitterness
very
light
bodied
and
not
very
drinkable
but
a
tiny
step
above
other
tv
ad
ta
beers
molson
ice
poured
out
like
most
lagers
do
it
has
a
standard
yellow
color
very
clear
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
head
fades
and
leave
you
with
just
a
glass
of
yellow
liquid
the
smell
has
some
of
the
traditional
lager
aromas
theyre
a
little
funky
and
had
some
grassy
notes
the
taste
is
of
light
malts
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
here
just
an
average
brew
id
drink
it
again
because
i
like
variety
its
easy
to
drink
its
pretty
cheap
and
its
readily
available
drinkability
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
edit
i
am
not
changing
any
scoreswhat
i
give
is
what
i
give
but
ill
note
that
its
a
shame
this
score
is
brought
down
by
the
subpar
appearance
of
this
beer
basically
a
typical
adjunct
lager
mild
and
cheap
not
one
id
voluntarily
drink
overall
not
a
bad
macro
i
have
to
admit
would
not
mind
it
again
for
the
style
not
too
shabby
none
of
the
negative
aspects
are
very
prominent
the
extra
bit
of
alcohol
behaves
itself
and
if
you
like
corn
thats
what
you
do
get
here
in
spades
wow
strains
of
homerism
anyone
overall
this
seems
to
be
just
another
macrostyle
lager
for
tha
masses
nothing
to
savor
just
pound
and
repeat
if
neccessary
im
not
happy
i
tried
it
but
this
is
what
i
do
drinkability
not
nearly
as
smooth
as
id
hoped
for
started
off
eh
but
ended
up
closer
to
bleh
by
the
time
id
reached
the
end
of
these
twelve
ounces
if
you
must
drink
it
cold
and
drink
it
fast
i
certainly
got
a
nice
big
two
fingers
worth
of
head
off
of
the
pour
it
looked
like
a
puffy
pillow
laying
atop
the
golden
yellow
beer
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
not
good
evincing
a
metallic
tang
along
with
cereal
adjuncts
and
a
light
lager
sweetness
oof
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
with
a
light
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
just
feel
like
i
am
trapped
on
a
treadmill
at
times
i
could
cut
and
paste
many
of
my
previous
reviews
of
american
adjunct
lagers
and
only
feel
the
slightest
pangs
of
guilt
regardless
it
was
pretty
weak
in
terms
of
flavor
and
that
same
buyers
remorse
continued
well
into
the
finish
this
was
really
boring
so
far
molson
golden
has
been
the
winner
in
the
family
this
beer
pours
a
clear
extra
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
of
big
bubbled
foam
that
recedes
within
a
few
seconds
into
virtually
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
bready
malt
quite
boring
the
taste
has
the
same
breay
malt
character
with
the
addition
of
a
mild
grassy
hop
presence
it
is
slightly
more
interesting
than
the
aroma
but
still
lacks
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
annoyingly
high
carbonation
and
a
watery
texture
overall
this
beer
has
some
flavor
which
distinguishes
it
from
most
of
its
style
but
it
still
has
a
long
ways
to
go
in
terms
of
complexity
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
again
24
ounce
can
from
local
grocery
store
clean
pale
yellow
pour
it
tastes
like
it
always
has
mellow
hoppy
to
some
degree
and
smooth
you
can
definitely
put
these
back
if
you
feel
so
inclined
poured
from
a
24
oz

a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch

smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
also
mild
some
malts
and
corn
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
here
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
not
terrible
but
nothing
special
here
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
an
average
white
head
not
much
on
the
nose
here
taste
is
very
light
as
well
nothing
interesting
at
all
grainymalty
with
maybe
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
extremely
thin
so
watery
that
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
its
drinkable
in
that
it
doesnt
do
any
offensive
or
challenging
but
its
not
enjoyable
enough
that
youd
want
to
have
more
than
one
catch

i
guess
a
pale
staw
gold
color
body
with
a
light
creamy
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
skunkyand
malty
very
little
else
the
flavor
is
very
grainy
and
has
an
artificially
sweet
finish
but
not
too
bad
this
is
a
little
better
than
i
was
expecting
very
sessionable
d
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
from
the
24

marked

on

2009
the
pour
is
a
pretty
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
good
inch
or
more
of
foamy
bubbly
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
corn
some
hops
and
some
malts
but
for
an
ice
beer
the
alcohol
scent
is
diminished
the
mouthfeel
is
heavier
than
water
with
reasonable
texture
and
staying
power
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
comes
across
as
malty
and
bready
with
a
tinge
of
sweetness
better
than
i
expected
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
dry
pilsner
malt
and
adjunct
scent
along
with
little
to
no
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
has
a
clean
pilsner
malt
and
adjunct
taste
with
a
super
dry
finish
its
easy
drinking
but
lacking
any
real
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
your
standard
ice
brewed
lager
its
crisp
and
clean
and
devoid
of
any
real
beer
taste
drinkability
its
not
horrible
but
i
probably
wont
be
getting
it
again

unremarkable

from
americas
oldest

drinkable
yea
taste
is
bland
and
unoffensive
and
thats
what
its
supposed
to
be
cant
attack
this
for
being
an
adjunct
lager
d
this
is
okay
if
i
were
to
ever
go
ice
fishing
in
canada
i
could
see
myself
taking
some
of
this
this
beer
has
a
light
body
with
light
carbonation
to
it

pretty
easy

most
canadian
beers

sweetness
finishing
notes
of

water
drinkability
seems
to
decrease
with
time
but
buzzfactor
goes
up
quickly
why
because
it
was
cheap
and
available
why
not
chump
out
of
a
green
bottle
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
retention
was
weak
but
the
lacing
actually
pretty
good
the
aroma
was
quite
skunky
with
lots
of
corn
and
a
light
sweetness
the
flavors
were
about
what
one
would
expect
starting
on
a
dry
grainy
note
my
palate
had
trouble
pulling
specifics
out
of
it
until
the
pale
malt
sweetness
at
the
end
finally
showed
up
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
rough
and
oily
the
carbonation
mediumhigh
and
the
body
medium
d
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
my
last
molson
ice
and
for
some
reason
its
easier
to
drink
now
than
it
was
back
then
its
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
after
shoveling
the
driveway
or
watching
hockey
notes
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
cleaner
crisper
ice
beers
that
i
have
had
rated
sep
23
2008
if
it
has
ice
in
the
name
chances
are
its
a
cheap
and
quick
buzz
and
thats
really
all
its
good
for
i
will
most
likely
have
it
again
but
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
golden
color
has
a
nice
white
head
that
stays
around
a
laces
a
bit
smells
sweet
a
bit
sour
or
metallic
taste
is
very
crisp
with
a
carbonation
bite
watery
and
some
pale
hops
for
flavor
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
goes
down
easy
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
this
is
a
very
poor
excuse
for
a
beer
even
when
compared
to
other
american
macro
lagers
its
subpar
d
a
little
too
sweet
and
a
little
low
on
the
carbonation
end
for
me
to
choose
this
over
other
macro
lagers
not
a
bad
example
but
not
something
i
can
see
serving
a
specific
purpose

with

overall
a
decent
drinkable
alternative
when

tight
or
when
theres
only

choices
available
im
very
surprised
this
beer
got
such
low
ratings
it
may
be
mass
produced
and
it
may
not
be
all
that
unique
but
molson
ice
is
certainly
delicious
and
gets
you
very
drunk
on
the
cheap
this
is
not
a
craft
brew
but
for
what
it
is
there
arent
many
better
beers
out
there
molson
ice
manages
to
be
refreshing
tasty
and
full
of
alcoholic
goodness
a
trifecter
of
awesomeness
it
drinks
well
in
hot
and
cold
weather
you
can
down
one
after
mowing
your
lawn
or
let
it
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
winter
night
molson
ice
and
i
go
way
back
my
taste
in
beer
has
certainly
become
much
more
eclectic
since
the
days
of
chugging
molson
ice
in
my
parents
basement
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
get
sick
of
this
beer
d
this
is
a
decent
but
very
ordinary
macro
lager
light
body
but
not
overly
carbonated
not
very
impressive
but
maybe
a
small
step
above
some
of
the
others
had
this
up
in
canada
where
it
is
8
3
if
my
notes
are
correct
pours
a
flat
gold
color
which
is
seethru
and
the
big
frothy
head
dies
quickly
a
semimetallic
smell
coupled
with
grainy
hops
and
no
malts
passes
for
the
smell
while
it
is
sharp
and
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
burn
it
goes
down
mostly
smooth
with
some
veggie
and
sweet
malts
taste
combo
albeit
ever
so
tastey
and
by
that
i
mean
it
rarely
tastes
good
i
wouldnt
mind
having
the
canadian
version
one
more
time
since
a
couple
can
buzz
you
other
than
that
avoid
pale
swill
yellow
color
and
overall
appearance
the
flavor
is
a
combination
of
grainy
malty
bitterness
and
some
skunk
not
easy
drinking
actually
not
a
big
fan
of
any
molson
product
best
ive
had
is
probably
the
golden
but
even
thats
very
limited
d
drinkability
no
thanks
not
very
good
or
likely
will
revisit
avoid
and
dont
bother
d
its
your
general
macro
here
not
a
whole
lot
of
taste
or
character
i
however
can
say
there
are
a
lot
of
worse
macro
ice
beers
out
there
i
dont
think
ive
drank
one
of
these
since
i
was
in
college
12
years
ago
so
why
not
try
it
again
12

2008
served
in
a
sam
adams

the
beer
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
is
low
lacing
is
good
it
smells
like
corn
malt
and
grain
not
offensive
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
a
teeny
bit
of
grassy
hops
in
there
but
for
the
most
part
it
tastes
like
a
macro
lager
but
a
little
better
than
similar
beers
same
with
the
aroma
theres
nothing
offensive
about
the
taste
mouthfeelbody
is
light
but
its
not
watery
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
its
not
bad
at
all
drinkable
if
you
want
a
superbland
beer
i
suppose
there
are
some
out
there
that
think
this
gives
you
an
extra
kick
its
only
6
more
than
a
typical
macro
with
the
same
lack
of
flavor
whatever
d
goes
down
easy
enough
this
is
the
party
staple
its
a
little
more
fun
to
down
than
the
regulars
without
killing
the
pocketbook
d
as
long
as
you
dont
have
an
allergy
to
the
same
yeasts
that
i
do
go
for
it
dreally
just
mild
all
over
a
good
beer
for
teenagers
looking
to
impress
girls
by
buying
something
other
than

it
was
my
first
beer
so
i
still
have
some
affection
for
it

molson

presents
a
finger
of
white
head
on
a
body
of
light
gold
body
the
smell
is
horriblethe
skunkiness
from
molsons
green
bottles
is
so
notorious
that
the
company
should
actually
patent
it
what
a
pity
especially
since
canadian
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
ice
and
golden
unquestionably
suffer
from
the
green
bottle
blues
the
flavor
cannot
salvage
this
beerits
decent
mild
with
corn
and
modest
malt
semisweet
the
carbonation
helps
thisits
not
flat
and
doesnt
fade
easily
but
in
the
end
this
is
not
a
tremendous
beer
by
a
long
shot
and
suffers
from
firstscent
impression
not
all
bad
and
decent
when
ice
cold
but
there
are
far
better
brews
and
any
canadian
beer
in
a
brown
bottle
would
get
chosen
before
molson
ice
from
a
24
ounce
can
into
a
glass
pale
gold
with
a
good
white
head
minimal
lacing
smells
like
corn
and
cereal
grain
with
a
touch
of
rubbing
alcohol
the
tastes
reflects
the
smell
and
is
only
slightly
better
good
carbonation
and
medocre
drinkabilty
qualities
ehh
molson
ice
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
sticky
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
grainy
the
flavor
is
the
sweet
with
more
of
the
malty
grainy
taste
there
is
some
sulfur
but
not
too
much
considering
the
green
bottle
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
years
but
im
not
sure
i
missed
it
drinkability
an
easy
brew
to
pound
very
light
and
refreshing
but
with
enough
flavor
to
let
you
know
it
is
a
beer
not
the
best
offering
by
molson
but
not
that
bad
for
a
macro
if
you
want
more
abv
from
these
guys
pick
up
a
molson
xxx
or
if
its
more
tolerable
flavor
youre
after
check
out
the
molson
canadian
otherwise
keep
moving
in
the
beer
aisle
color
is
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
head
that
fades
quick
though
aroma
is
decent
and
malty
for
a
macro
lager
taste
is
much
of
the
same
except
that
theres
some
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
a
bite
in
the
back
of
the
throat
goes
down
smooth
though
with
some
adjunct
taste
possibly
corn
inoffensive
strong
and
not
too
bad
for
a
macro
lager
i
would
give
it
a
fair
rating
much
like
i
gave
molson
canadian
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
and
i
can
reuse
the
bottles
on
brew
day
id
pick
this
beer
over
bud
or
miller
i
remember
when
this
first
came
out
everyone
was
raving
about
the
alcohol
content
drink
and
get
fried
faster
honestly
i
couldnt
get
fried
fast
enough
to
keep
drinking
this
beer
far
from
the
worst
ive
had
sure
but
with
no
real
identity
and
a
dead
skunk
in
the
nose
i
can
safely
say
i
will
steer
well
clear
from
here
on
out
ice
cold
it
goes
down
but
anything
less
and
its
just
as
likely
to
come
back
up
cooked
cabbage
for
an
aroma
cooked
corn
for
the
taste
no
malt
anywhere

and
i
thought
the
ice
brews
were
stronger
this
lil
puppy
is
only
5
6
glad
this
was
left
by
a
brolaw
id
hate
to
think
of
buying
one
whata
crap
brew
i
hope
the
other
molson
brews
are
better
than
this
not
even
lawnmower
level
overall
not
too
impressed
id
rather
drink
golden
d
i
can
drink
it
ill
have
a
few
if
i
dont
pay
for
them
i
opened
the
bottle
and
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
was
the
bitter
aroma
it
was
very
pungent
and
hit
my
nose
quickly
after
i
took
the
light
sip
and
let
the
golden
liquid
roll
across
my
mouth
i
swallowed
i
noticed
two
very
distinct
problems
first
off
the
beer
seemed
to
coat
my
mouth
with
something
secondly
it
had
a
very
bitter
and
dry
aftertaste
after
a
few
more
i
ended
up
just
slamming
it
to
get
it
over
with
it
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
think
i
have
ever
had
although
i
am
by
no
means
a
beer
expert
i
am
sure
there
are
worse
but
i
ended
up
giving
it
another
shot
a
few
days
later
and
still
of
course
had
the
same
reaction
i
would
not
recommend
molson
ice
no
matter
how
much
canada
reminds
you
of
hockey
d
not
too
tasty
but
it
at
least
it
isnt
filling
if
im
forced
to
drink
a
beer
in
this
style
it
wouldnt
be
this
one
if
i
had
another
choice
poured
out
of
a
24oz
can
that
i
picked
up
for
the
train
ride
home
the
color
was
slightly
toasted
straw
clear
with
a
decent
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
slight
cap
that
left
some
soapy
lacing
the
smell
is
just
terrible
total
adjuncts
cooked
veggies
gross
the
taste
is
more
bland
than
the
smell
which
is
a
good
thing
in
this
case
it
has
an
artifical
sweetness
to
it
no
malt
or
hops
to
be
identified
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
poor
the
beer
goes
down
easy
but
doesnt
taste
like
anything
not
something
i
would
look
to
buy
i
dont
know
but
all
ice
beers
to
me
suck
this
is
definetly
one
of
the
better
ones
though
its
a
lot
better
than
labatts
ice
not
like
molson
to
put
out
something
like
this
but
i
blame
it
on
ice
beers
sucking
in
general
its
not
great
but
nothing
to
complain
about
ya
know
might
as
well
go
with
the
beast
my
dad
classified
this
as
a
ballpark
beer
im
inclined
to
agree
mouthfeeldrinkability
overly
carbonated
its
quick
and
fierce
in
the
mouth
leaving
no
rewards
during
or
after
the
swallow
the
cheap
fake
taste
of
this
beer
is
horrific
and
kills
drinkability
big
time
molson
ice
pours
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
at
first
the
aroma
seems
skunky
but
then
i
think
i
smell
some
hops
some
grain
aromas
too
doesnt
taste
like
much
slight
hop
flavor
is
noticeable
kind
of
a
dry
finish
alcohol
slightly
noticeable
bought
on
the
reccommendation
of
a
friend
who
likes
guinness
about
as
much
as
i
do
yellowlight
amber
body
with
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
looks
better
than
i
expected
smells
yeasty
and
hoppy
somewhat
sweet
smells
tasty
tastes
sweet
and
watered
down
but
agreeable
very
slight
hop
on
the
finish
not
great
but
better
than
i
thought
itd
be
give
me
this
over
any
anheuserbusch
at
least
that
ive
tried
any
day
of
the
week
if
i
have
to
drink
a
macro
i
decided
to
pour
this
in
a
mug
instead
of
chugging
it
out
of
the
can
when
it
settled
the
beer
was
a
straw
yellow
with
a
tall
fizzing
head
of
white
foam
it
fizzled
away
really
fast
and
it
decided
to
leave
few
rings
and
no
lace
around
the
glass
it
had
a
light
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
plenty
of
adjuncts
it
almost
basically
tasted
like
it
smelled
sweet
malts
plenty
of
adjuncts
like
corn
and
rice
splash
of
hops
and
some
alcohol
at
the
very
end
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
not
too
watery
and
with
an
aftertaste
of
corn
it
tasted
like
an
average
macro
lager
and
something
id
probably
not
buy
again
unless
its
1
for
a
24
oz
can
d
it
doesnt
start
out
very
drinkable
but
after
a
few
the
5
6
abv
fix
that
light
body
mouthfeel
improves
as
the
ale
warms
a
bit
i
think
it
pretty
drinkable
for
an
aml
and
it
does
pack
a
small
punch
one
was
enough
for
me
good
stuff
it
doesnt
have
that
heavy
bitter
taste
that
most
imports
have
you
can
drink
a
number
of
them
and
they
all
go
down
as
equally
smooth
it
gets
you
to
that
buzz
level
a
litttle
more
quicker
than
other
beers
if
you
never
had
one
before
its
worth
the
23
00
for
the
case
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
stein
its
a
very
average
looking
macro
lager
really
indistinuishable
from
any
other
its
a
light
yellow
with
very
little
head
what
head
there
is
is
white
and
dissipates
quickly
lacing
is
minimal
almost
nonexistant
but
to
be
expected
from
this
type
of
beer
theres
a
very
faint
skunky
aroma
but
its
gone
quickly
almost
no
nose
on
this
beer
the
palate
is
utterly
forgettable
it
tastes
similar
to
budweiser
coors
etc
theres
really
nothing
distinuishing
about
it
its
just
a
very
very
average
beer
straw
yellow
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
semi
sweet
malt
with
a
mild
alcoholic
sweetness
taste
like
your
average
macro
lager
soft
malts
a
little
bit
of
grassy
hop
metallic
dry
aftertaste
light
bodied
and
drinkable
next
not
a
bad
commercially
macro
lager
you
gotta
like
the
5
6
abv
i
think
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
very
cold
and
out
of
the
bottle
taste
has
a
good
thirst
quenchingness
to
it
lemonpear
some
hops
little
malt
carbonation
leaves
a
clean
finish
but
a
bit
of
skunk
on
the
tail
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
some
carbonation
small
head
some
lacing
afterwards
the
scent
is
kinda
skunky
but
not
to
bad
some
malts
and
citrus
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
and
a
dry
finish
lightmedium
body
drinkable
i
like
this
brew
much
better
than
the
golden
the
taste
is
sweet
and
has
that
same
mild
astringency
theres
a
tiny
hint
of
a
biscuity
taste
bittering
hops
just
barely
noticable
watery
but
inoffensive
overall
drinkability
is
low
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
this
bottle
fortunately
not
a
sixpack
is
for
science
not
enjoyment
never
again
in
comparison
to
molsons
lager
this
one
is
a
little
stronger
in
sweet
malts
and
a
little
harsh
with
the
hopping
hops
get
dangerously
close
to
lightstruck
flavors
are
rich
but
a
noticably
grainy
vegitol
and
biteey
has
almost
a
bakingsoda
finish
as
the
beer
qualities
relax
and
the
harshness
and
husky
bitterness
increases
still
a
worthwhile
attempt
but
the
higher
alcohol
is
not
worth
it
notes
not
a
good
one
the
only
saving
grace
for
this
beer
is
that
it
looks
nice
fluffy
white
head
somewhat
bronze
golden
color
nice
as
for
the
rest
of
this
beer
horrible
i
like
molson
i
prefer
it
over
american
macros
but
this
stuff
is
nasty
strong
alcohol
flavor
yet
abv
is
not
really
that
much
higher
than
the
regular
stuff
a
bit
of
a
rough
grainy
flavor
in
there
might
be
skunked
a
little
body
is
thicker
than
most
which
takes
away
from
smoothness
and
ease
this
is
tough
to
drink
really
tough
imo
ice
beers
are
stupid
and
pointless
and
this
one
is
in
particular
stupid
and
pointless
buy
regular
molson
instead
pours
a
very
clear
extra
pale
straw
with
a
big
threefinger
head
and
unlikely
retention
for
a
macro
hoppy
aroma
with
spent
grains
and
adjuncts
the
bitter
and
bland
taste
predicted
by
the
smell
prove
false
when
the
light
body
and
active
carbonation
glide
down
your
throat
extra
smooth
noble
hop
flavor
is
balanced
but
set
against
an
adjunct
lager
flavor
moderate
euro
skunk
taste
lingers
a
bit
but
finishes
mostly
clean
for
once
an
ice
version
turns
out
better
than
the
original
ive
got
to
say
for
an
ice
lager
this
wasnt
too
bad
poured
out
to
a
golden
color
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
not
too
much
not
too
little
no
lacing
noted
odors
of
corn
malt
and
dough
were
noted
as
was
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
was
decent
for
being
a
macro
brew
corn
malt
and
a
touch
of
barley
kind
of
dry
finished
a
little
on
the
watery
side
with
a
hint
of
dryness
not
bad
worth
a
try
it
is
drinkable
i
will
remember
this
beer
like
i
remember
miller
high
life
it
will
have
a
positive
mental
note
but
it
will
have
an
asterisk
next
to
it
drink
only
when
in
need
of
something
cheap
for
an
occasion
when
taste
is
approaching
secondary

in
reality
i
didnt
think
this
beer
was
bad
at
all
i
need
to
try
this
beer
again
maybe
it
was
a
fluke
i
purchased
one
12ounce
bottle
in
omaha
a
vertical
pour
will
give
you
a
5finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
but
it
does
leave
a
good
lace
clear
very
pale
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
very
light
bodied
nose
is
skunky
starts
slightly
sweet
but
both
the
malt
and
hops
are
very
light
theres
no
beef
to
this
beer
1
50
for
a
12oz
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
overallpassable
beer
in
my
opinion
but
i
will
say
that
as
far
as
ice
beers
go
it
is
one
of
the
most
tolerable
ive
had
so
if
this
is
your
style
go
for
it
you
may
have
found
your
new
favorite
beer
drinkability
yeah
sure
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
why
bother
little
satisfaction
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
not
too
terrible
but
nothing
special
either
more
drinkable
than
most
ices
but
pbr
is
better
tasting
cheaper
and
just
as
available
when
opting
to
go
slummin
another
con
is
that
too
often
i
get
a
bottle
that
is
skunked
or
damn
near
drinkability
is
average
i
remember
having
no
problems
knocking
these
back
when
i
was
younger
now
i
wouldnt
get
it
just
because
ice
beers
just
dont
make
me
go
out
of
my
way
still
this
is
an
okay
generic
burp
beer
poured
witha
froathy
meranguelike
white
head
on
a
clear
plae
yellow
body
soft
mild
maltcorn
aroma
and
thats
about
it
nothing
else
surprisingly
a
mouthfeel
with
some
heft
to
it
not
as
watery
as
i
though
it
would
be
has
a
creamy
finish
to
it
not
really
that
bad
if
you
degas
it
a
bit
upon
further
examinination
the
aroma
contained
an
asringent
corny
aroma
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
mouthfeel
this
was
experienced
as
it
warmed
up
dont
let
it
do
this
drinkability
its
ok
but
my
experience
with
this
beer
is
i
have
to
drink
them
quickly
or
else
they
tend
to
skunk
i
will
have
to
have
at
least
one
other
ice
beer
to
compair
this
to
but
as
far
as
macro
produced
adjunct
lagers
go
id
just
as
soon
not
purchase
this
one
again
poured
very
light
very
clear
very
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
just
the
faintist
wiff
of
malt
in
the
nose
watery
lame
a
waste
of
good
water
what
else
can
be
said
of
this
nasty
brew
to
bad
molson
doesnt
brew
a
classsier
product
this
stuff
is
ok
to
boil
some
brats
in
good
for
a
very
hot
humid
day
while
pushing
the
mower
besides
that
pass
it
by
buy
some
craft
brew
overall
this
beer
is
probably
among
the
best
of
the
ice
lager
beers
which
is
probably
one
of
the
most
disgusting
beer
styles
on
the
market
today
not
a
great
beer
but
better
than
a
few
of
them
out
there
the
brewery
says
that
molson
ice
is
americas
1
imported
ice
beer
think
about
that
for
a
minute
what
other
countries
besides
the
u
s
and
canada
even
brew
such
a
thing
as
an
ice
beer
its
all
hype
anyway
a
macro
lager
is
a
macro
lager
is
a
macro
lager
this
is
an
especially
bad
version
though
so
i
guess
that
there
are
degrees
of
badness
one
of
the
better
mass
produced
pale
lagers
drinkability
not
that
greatyeah
you
could
slam
down
some
of
these
but
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
o
k
is
the
best
i
can
give
it
although
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
just
to
get
it
under
my
belt
not
one
i
would
try
again
drinkability
all
the
mediocre
qualities
of
this
beer
aside
this
beer
is
a
worthy
session
beer
its
rather
strong
and
goes
down
easy
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
although
there
is
a
slight
fruity
twinge
to
it
the
taste
was
remarkably
smooth
very
a
little
bit
of
malt
taste
insterpersed
with
some
hops
overall
this
beer
is
ramarkably
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
definitely
one
of
the
better
ice
beers
that
i
have
had
it
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
for
tailgating
parties
molson
ice
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
isnt
a
bad
beer
to
drink
with
buddies
at
a
ball
game
or
fishing
its
not
offensive
and
can
really
be
quite
refreshing
drinkability

this
wasnt
bad
but
the
ice
treatment
of
this
lager
didnt
help
the
beer
at
all
and
only
gave
it
a
0
6
increase
in
abv
i
just
find
the
whole
thing
a
bit
too
rough
edged
over
all
no
polish
to
this
beer
and
you
can
substitute
anyone
one
of
dozens
of
other
beers
for
this
one
light
thin
and
corny
better
than
a
bud
i
spose
but
thats
damning
with
faint
praise
like
others
i
recommend
only
having
this
ice
cold
and
only
in
a
pinch
i
can
tolerate
it
once
in
a
great
while
but
its
still
a
very
plain
jane
brew
clear
pale
yellow
hue
thin
carbonated
head
faint
adjunct
present
aroma
some
grainy
and
earthy
smells
are
uninviting
husky
and
grainy
overcarbonated
champagne
like
feel
a
delicate
taste
of
corn
which
is
even
advertised
directly
on
the
can
very
thin
horrible
as
it
warms
not
much
going
on
here
other
than
a
highly
overhyped
mass
marketed
northern
tier
macro
better
than
average
molson
the
beer
to
have
when
there
is
no
good
beers
because
the
host
is
an
ignoramous
on
beer
the
ice
is
a
gimmick
but
if
you
serve
it
exceptionally
cold
it
taste
a
tad
like
vodka
left
in
the
freezer
and
thats
the
best
i
can
say
about
it
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
whispy
thin
white
shadow
of
a
head
very
little
aroma
to
speak
of
a
hint
of
graininess
and
faint
hops
theres
a
grassy
grainy
sweetness
but
theres
also
a
lack
of
depth
and
complexity
finish
is
crisp
and
sharp
alcohol
cant
be
tasted
but
its
faintly
evident
in
the
aroma
much
more
carbonated
than
is
necessary
average
and
everyday
and
unispiring
still
not
as
undrinkable
as
most
macros
cheers
not
a
bad
summertime
beer
if
you
are
in
a
jam
and
cannot
find
some
quality
stuff
this
will
get
you
through
typical
american
lager
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
thrown
in
i
experienced
no
skunkiness
due
to
the
fact
my
sample
was
from
a
big
24oz
can
i
could
enjoy
this
stuff
if
nothing
i
preferred
more
was
around
next
time
ill
panhandle
yellow
not
gold
when
poured
it
had
a
nice
head
that
lasted
thru
the
drink
the
green
bottle
used
to
be
cool
but
i
think
it
enhances
light
and
kills
what
taste
it
has
smelled
a
bit
of
skunk
but
not
overpowering
i
liked
this
ice
but
could
fair
better
if
i
wanted
the
higher
alcohol
i
would
drink
it
again
12
oz
green
bottle
poured
a
typical
straw
yellow
with
a
moderate
head
that
didnt
stick
around
long
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
out
jumped
the
skunk
after
letting
it
set
for
a
few
minutes
was
able
to
smell
some
faint
hints
of
malt
taste
was
fizzy
and
watery
and
bland
not
that
its
bad
it
is
just
nothing
special
good
session
beer
i
feel
as
if
im
stuck
in
a
rut
of
reviewing
average
to
below
average
brews
that
doesnt
change
with
molson
ice
actually
poured
a
deeper
goldyellow
than
i
expected
but
with
absoulutely
no
head
and
minimal
carbonation
smelled
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
remembered
and
the
taste
proved
my
nose
right
definitely
too
sweet
of
a
taste
here
for
me
and
i
was
put
off
by
the
hints
of
alchohol
as
well
not
a
major
problem
with
the
beer
itself
more
of
a
personal
preference
thing
but
i
was
still
not
that
impressed
overall
not
a
rewarding
expierience
one
of
the
better
ice
beers
out
there
straw
color
with
a
short
head
not
much
in
the
flavor
department
regular
molson
taste
but
in
ice
form
cheap
i
buy
this
sometimes
when
im
very
strapped
for
cash
in
the
summert
months
packs
a
punch
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
flavor
still
one
of
the
best
ice
beers
on
the
market
molson
ice
is
a
quaffable
beverage
that
doesnt
deliver
a
whole
lot
except
for
a
buzz
but
makes
for
a
good
hotweather
beer
some
of
the
unpleasantness
in
this
beer
can
definitely
be
cut
down
if
served
really
cold
altogether
an
average
macro
ice
beer
veryvery
light
beer
goes
down
just
like
water
it
is
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
on
it
after
taste
is
light
but
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
left
behind
not
bad
all
around
though
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
even
better
is
the
price
1
25
ill
definately
be
back
for
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
very
good
either
just
typical
north
americancanadian
macro
crap
drink
labatt
ice
if
you
want
a
better
ice
beer
this
beer
came
to
the
table
in
the
pint
glass
a
gold
straw
color
the
head
was
nonexistent
but
i
did
happen
to
look
over
and
notice
that
it
was
white
when
it
came
out
of
the
tap
the
aroma
was
not
all
that
there
smells
of
corn
grain
water
some
citrus
and
hops
the
taste
was
watery
and
not
that
impressive
some
malt
hops
and
corn
were
present
but
i
did
notice
the
taste
of
alcohol
in
my
glass
decent
carbonation
was
present
the
one
thing
wrong
with
this
beer
is
that
the
few
times
i
have
had
it
before
i
noticed
that
they
all
tasted
different
from
the
next
better
then
drinking
the
other
stuff
they
had
on
tap
this
is
like
the
canadian
bud
molson
ice
is
my
cheap
beer
the
old
stand
by
it
has
good
flavor
and
goes
down
easy
plus
its
no
that
filling
so
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
it
does
have
a
kick
almost
like
heiny
but
not
as
bad
if
you
want
to
get
buzzed
on
a
good
worth
the
money
beer
this
is
the
one
the
bottle
is
very
ugly
a
precurser
to
what
awaits
this
beer
needs
to
be
very
cold
just
to
make
it
past
your
tongue
gold
color
with
a
nice
thin
head
it
tastes
like
metal
if
warm
no
taste
if
chilled
properly
stick
to
colt
45
happy
drinking
clear
very
nice
yellowish
gold
color
topped
by
a
creamy
white
head
that
holds
well
the
aroma
is
limited
but
reveals
a
very
lightly
fruity
softly
grainy
malt
the
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
moderate
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
crisp
the
flavor
offers
far
more
character
than
the
aroma
suggests
with
a
fruity
sweetish
grainy
malt
thats
backed
by
a
gently
crisp
lightly
spicy
hoppiness
although
the
alcohol
is
only
5
6
by
volume
its
slightly
noticeable
combined
with
the
fruitiness
my
guess
would
be
that
theyre
fermenting
this
lager
fairly
warm
over
60f
it
finishes
fairly
short
and
dry
an
unremarkable
fairly
basic
beer
that
has
a
bit
of
malt
hop
character
and
an
easy
drinkability
my
first
canadian
ice
beer
it
poored
like
a
classic
pilsner
style
pale
gold
with
a
nice
head
it
gives
off
a
strong
oder
thats
more
noticed
than
the
taste
the
taste
is
alittle
bitter
but
not
bad
alcohol
is
up
at
5
9
but
not
like
the
strength
or
as
heavy
as
an
ipa
a
ok
hot
day
summer
brew
like
the
name
implies
serve
very
cold
yellow
color
with
a
fair
head
peculiar
smell
weak
hopsmalt
taste
but
not
unpleasant
no
headache
thats
a
plus
finishes
okay
i
normally
dont
drink
ice
beers
as
i
usually
take
that
as
meaning
no
flavor
high
alcohol
i
used
to
drink
molson
ice
in
college
and
when
it
first
came
out
i
prefered
it
to
bud
etc
the
one
value
it
has
is
that
it
is
beer
and
when
cold
it
drinkable
some
bitterness
gives
this
beer
taste
but
overall
not
very
good
i
used
to
like
this
beer
in
college
but
it
seems
to
be
skunky
more
often
than
not
not
worth
the
risk
even
though
it
is
a
smooth
clean
beer
on
its
good
days
thin
lace
with
good
clarity
a
bit
more
harsh
from
what
i
remember
mild
solvent
alcohol
in
the
nose
and
flavour
thin
on
the
malt
with
little
hop
to
balance
though
being
on
the
dry
side
it
is
not
too
bad
there
are
cheaper
ice
beers
that
taste
the
same
this
beer
is
not
less
than
average
but
not
more
ether
golden
yellow
in
color
with
medium
big
bubbled
head
firm
hop
character
is
balanced
by
its
smooth
medium
body
with
good
drinkability
slight
alcohol
taste
consumed
directly
from
the
bottle
while
playing
some
frisbee
golf
smell
is
classic
macro
lager
adjuncts
and
adjunct
sweetness
mostly
adjunct
sweetness
with
a
slight
bit
of
malt
detected
and
a
few
hops
thrown
in
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
as
far
as
ice
lagers
go
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
that
fits
the
style
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
when
the
cash
is
tight
and
im
not
in
it
to
savor
the
taste
i
will
go
with
this
one
i
found
this
addition
to
molsons
line
to
be
a
disappointment
as
a
macrobrew
i
usually
tend
to
get
molson
when
offered
a
canadian
beer
but
i
think
the
other
molson
holds
up
better
than
this
one
exactly
what
part
of
the
population
likes
to
drink
this
beer
it
tastes
like
sink
runoff
its
harsh
with
a
bad
aftertaste
and
it
has
no
odor
another
case
of
bottled
urine
this
i
will
never
ever
ever
touch
again
i
nearly
had
to
spit
it
out
the
first
time
i
had
one
i
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
since
then
i
have
a
few
times
taken
a
swig
of
someones
each
time
hoping
that
this
time
it
will
taste
good
it
never
does
absolutely
disgusting
beer
generally
i
dont
really
care
for
ice
beers
you
are
usually
left
with
an
aftertaste
that
resembles
swallowing
cologne
however
this
one
isnt
too
bad
somewhat
sweet
corn
and
actually
easy
to
drink
5
6
abv
which
is
slightly
lower
in
alcohol
than
many
of
the
other
ice
beers
out
there
and
not
too
bad
i
really
wanted
to
dislike
this
beer
but
i
found
myself
reaching
for
another
one
a
decent
bbq
quaffer
from
molson
so
what
does
it
taste
like
go
out
on
a
rainy
night
find
a
skunk
that
was
knocked
dead
by
a
case
of
cheap
beer
falling
off
a
truck
take
that
bad
boy
home
wring
him
out
in
a
glass
molson
makes
some
decent
brews
this
is
not
one
of
em
this
is
what
we
used
to
buy
to
get
drunk
quick
and
cheap
when
i
was
younger
7
bucks
a
twelve
pack
i
will
be
letting
a
few
more
secrets
out
about
other
strohs
beers
in
other
reviews
its
no
worse
than
anything
else
at
the
price
why
not
drink
the
detroit
version
of
bud
true
story
in
college
i
purchased
a
12
pack
of
strohs
i
could
only
drink
three
of
them
i
gave
the
next
six
away
to
one
person
at
a
time
because
no
one
would
take
a
second
one
i
ended
up
pouring
the
last
three
down
the
drain
after
a
year
in
the
fridge
make
of
that
what
you
will
used
to
tend
bar
30
yrs
ago
and
still
carries
the
same
taste
and
characteristics
today
was
a
very
popular
pour
in
the
rust
belt
region
mainly
used
to
chase
the
after
shift
shot
and
a
beer
the
price
is
about
the
same
today
as
it
was
30
yrs
ago
i
bought
a
15
pack
of
cans
for
8
49
in
october
2014
given
that
it
has
weathered
inflation
better
than
most
beers
light
corn
grist
faint
hops
near
toffee
like
malt
light
bitterness
coupled
with
corn
cob
ever
so
faint
diactel
but
not
too
bad
ive
had
dirtier
lagers
but
cant
call
it
clean
light
bodied
watery
brew
overall
this
is
an
ok
adjunct
lager
tastes
like
another
premium
beer
michelob
bland
taste
is
astringent
and
watery
slightly
harsh
papery
grainy
flavor
thats
extremely
hard
to
pick
up
bland
and
only
slightly
offensive
has
little
redeeming
value
its
not
one
of
the
better
nostalgia
macros
out
there
pbr
is
far
better
for
a
generic
macro
o
tastes
much
better
than
i
remember
20
years
ago
quite
refreshing
i
think
ill
have
a
couple
more
tonight
cheers
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
get
drunk
on
it
is
not
a
horrible
thirty
pack
like
a
natural
light
but
it
is
not
a
fantastic
beer
either
i
do
like
milwaukees
best
ice
better
but
this
is
god
for
the
price
and
ill
buy
it
again
because
i
definitely
like
it
better
than
bud
light
strohs
is
a
fire
roasted
hops
brew
this
brew
has
a
nice
golden
amber
color
has
a
rich
taste
and
smooth
a
taste
you
will
not
find
anywhere
else
it
is
your
everyday
american
larger
beer
this
is
a
good
drinking
brew
goes
down
smooth
priced
right
i
will
be
getting
this
brew
to
change
up
on
other
main
stream
brews
out
on
the

a
passable
c
strohs
obviously
isnt
the
greatest
beer
ive
ever
had
but
as
far
as
cheap
adjunct
lagers
go
you
could
do
worse
far
far
worse
this
is
a
serviceable
macro
brew
that
will
get
the
job
done
i
could
pound
these
all
night
and
thanks
to
the
relatively
clean
taste
and
lack
of
cloying
adjunct
notes
never
get
tired
of
it
one
of
3
or
4
value
brand
lagers
available
in
the
ontario
market
that
i
would
consider
worth
repurchasing
strohs
floats
amongst
the
rest
of
the
cream
of
the
crap
and
i
hold
it
in
roughly
similar
esteem
as
the
likes
of
pbr
miller
high
life
and
other
upper
tier
domestic
us
macros
bottoms
up
poured
into

foamed
and
quickly
went
to
thin
layer
slight

to

high

very
light
watered
down
flavorpale
yellow
better
then
bud
or
coors
for
a
cheap
beer
not
bad
for
just
a
plain
basic
no
frills
beer
i
will
buy
a
case
again
for
river
float
trips
a
good
riverfishing
kinda
of
beer
we
switched
to
national
bohemian
as
a
step
up
from
this
not
a
great
night
for
good
beer
i
liked
this
beer
as
compared
to
the
american
lagers
of
the
time
was
a
good
price
and
tasted
better
than
bud
or
miller
at
least
to
me
oh
youd
better
believe
this
is
part
of
a
spelunky
fest
it
pours
a
clear
yellow
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
and
very
light
wheat
the
taste
holds
notes
of
corn
flowers
and
a
slightly
odd
and
vague
sweetness
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
in
a
while
though
still
a
good
distance
away
from
a
truly
good
beer
ive
tried
many
different
beers
ales
etc
over
the
last
few
years
making
an
effort
to
visit
breweries
to
sample
their
products
at
their
freshest
while
there
are
certainly
many
wonderful
brews
available
today
strohs
is
the
one
to
which
i
continue
to
return
itll
always
bring
a
smile
to
your
face
and
the
certainty
that
it
tastes
the
way
beer
should
taste
i
got
this
expecting
it
to
maybe
be
like
a
blue
ribbon
but
strohs
pales
in
comparison
this
is
a
drinkable
betterthanbmc
macro
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
but
id
definitely
take
a
pbr
over
this
one
pbrs
hint
of
sweetness
and
seemingly
better
quality
makes
me
choose
that
one
over
strohs
o
overall
this
beer
wins
an
award
in
my
opinion
the
award
for
blandest
beer
i
have
ever
had
they
shouldnt
even
brew
this
stuff
it
actually
has
less
flavor
than
bud
light
luckily
i
didnt
pay
for
it
as
i
had
it
at
a
party
the
party
was
definitely
some
fun
after
knocking
back
10
of
these
though
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
even
for
the
style
i
didnt
know
this
was
brewed
by
pabst
personally
id
rather
just
have
a
pbr
this
beer
is
good
for
when
you
want
to
still
drink
abunch
of
beer
then
be
completely
fine
to
drive
ive
drank
this
all
day
and
had
buddies
call
me
at
night
to
go
get
a
bite
to
eat
and
do
some
real
partying
afterwards
so
if
anything
its
a
good
warm
up
beer
i
suppose
light
bodied
this
is
a
lawn
mower
beer
or
weekend
party
through
and
through
its
slightly
sticky
and
coats
the
tongue
a
little
going
down
also
slightly
drying
an
okay
beer
better
than
the
average
macro
but
not
better
than
anything
else
surprisingly
i
enjoyed
this
for
the
style
the
hops
were
impeccable
the
grainy
qualities
were
kept
to
a
minimum
and
it
was
easy
to
drink
it
succeeds
at
being
all
that
its
trying
to
be
and
how
many
of
us
can
say
that
strohs
is
a
light
colored
beer
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
for
the
style
it
goes
down
nice
and
simple
if
you
get
a
nice
batch
not
a
lot
to
talk
with
the
taste
really
like
that
you
can
buy
a
15
pack
made
by
pabst
better
then
the
bud
or
miller
offerings
overall
its
quite
unimpressive
but
not
entirely
undrinkable
pours
a
clear
straw
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
slight
sweet
malt
pale
malt
grain
and
slight
citrus
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
grain
pale
malt
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
overall
decent
aroma
blend
and
body
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
for
me
this
is
another
beer
i
can
add
to
list
of
fridge
beer
for
my
none
craft
friends
quite
a
pale
yellow
beer
typical
macro
looks
decent
head
a
little
thicker
than
most
and
lasts
about
as
long
as
any
massproduced
aal
that
is
not
very
long
not
much
visible
carbonation
glass
like
clarity
boring
looks

is
grainy
a
faint

subtle
metallic

wet

fades
quickly
to

lager

minimal
hops
bitterness
clean
finish
about
average
tastes
light
bubbly
carbonation
a
little
too
much
for
my
tastes
but
not
bad
overall
overall
i
definitely
think
that
strohs
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
of
the
macro
adjunct
lagers
the
fact
that
the
price
is
right
only
makes
it
better
while
i
would
still
rather
have
a
well
down
craft
ale
sometimes
you
just
want
a
simple
cheap
beer
and
this
fits
the
bill
i
wonder
how
many
people
referenced
30
pack
of
strohs
30
pack
of
hos
in
their
review
o
it
just
doesnt
have
that
detroit
river
water
taste
anymore
the
wife
has
me
on
a
beer
budget
this
week
and
i
needed
something
to
last
me
a
weekend
its
really
no
worse
than
most
premiumpriced
domestics
in
the
same
vein
and
actually
better
than
most
comparablypriced
beers
its
still
pretty
gross
though
if
what
youre
looking
for
is
a
cheap
beer
to
keep
your
fridge
full
this
is
my
first
suggestion
its
not
much
different
from
others
in
this
category
ie
macro
brew
adjunct
lager
yet
the
one
thing
that
sets
it
apart
is
hops
granted
its
no
ipa
im
no
noob
im
a
certified
hop
head
but
i
swear
to
you
there
is
an
essence
of
hop
oil
in
this
beer
certainly
more
than
can
be
found
in
high
life
oddly
enough
i
find
it
to
be
most
present
when
imbibed
directly
from
the
can
and
not
so
much
from
the
bottle
or
glass
put
it
in
a
keepercooler
on
a
hot
day
and
get
it
before
those
annoying
hipsters
do
thisll
be
the
next
pbr
on
campus
took
it
down
straight
from
the
can
not
a
ton
of
flavor
some
corn
and
grain
nothing
overpowering
light
bodied
beer
with
plenty
of
carbonation
went
down
smooth
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
without
a
problem
dreally
easy
drinking
cheap
domestic
beer
thats
nice
every
once
in
a
while
yet
another
classic
domestic
cheap
beer
from
random
notes
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
brew
with
an
average
white
head
that
quickly
dissolves
to
a
fine
film
and
white
ring
aroma
of
corn
grits
some
watery
citrus
peel
and
a
touch
of
burnt
ash
flavor
is
light
bodied
well
carbonated
a
gritty
texture
with
flavors
of
watery
corn
syrup
bread
crust
and
some
citrus
finish
is
crisp
clean
cut
with
a
very
short
lasting
bitterness
d
hop
character
in
an
american
lager
it
has
a
decent
body
and
mouthfeel
looks
okay
and
tastes
okay
but
does
fall
down
a
bit
on
the
nose
still
it
is
a
fair
bit
better
than
many
others
at
its
price
and
more
than
a
few
above
it
doverall
not
very
good
beer
but
not
terrible
for
what
was
paid
if
your
looking
for
a
beer
to
just
get
trashed
on
or
need
to
be
economical
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
consider
trust
me
im
an
engineering
student
pours
with
about
two
fingers
of
light
airy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
liquid
is
bright
gold
and
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
color
than
most
adjunct
lagers
odor
is
grassy
and
mild
dont
notice
much
from
the
malts
tastes
like
grains
or
grass
fairly
dry
for
this
style
strohs
is
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
not
too
sweet
and
not
sour
or
stale
if
youre
looking
for
a
brew
to
buy
in
mass
quantities
for
a
party
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
watery
but
still
a
very
crisp
clean
taste
better
than
many
others
anything
bud
except
for
the
new
wheat
which
might
be
better
overall
there
just
isnt
too
much
to
write
on
a
beer
like
this
not
a
lot
of
flavors
here
no
surprise
not
something
i
plan
on
drinking
again
but
i
could
if
i
had
to
overall
a
ok
beer
would
be
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
rjt
goes
down
easy
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
and
not
really
notice
much
less
offensive
than
other
examples
of
the
style
its
only
sold
by
one
supermarket
chain
in
15packs
for
8
99
making
me
wonder
whether
it
will
be
discontinued
a
la
oldsmobile
it
has
a
drier
taste
than
most
american
macros
not
ricey
and
sweet
but
fewer
hops
than
most
of
us
would
like
strohs
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
dry
graininess
dominates
the
aroma
not
too
much
else
there
the
flavor
is
crisp
dry
and
a
bit
grainy
with
a
surprising
decent
amount
of
bitterness
no
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
just
another
cheap
lager
but
i
think
its
a
hair
better
than
average
mouthfeel
is
sticky
with
a
below
average
amount
of
carbonation
for
an
adjunct
and
overall
nothing
special
this
is
something
i
could
drink
a
few
of
on
a
party
night
something
cheap
but
still
is
far
above
average
for
the
price
probably
wont
buy
it
ever
again
just
something
the
roommate
grabbed
on
a
whim
and
thought
id
give
it
a
try
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
picked
up
a
30pack
from
shangys
for
well
not
much
to
share
with
friends
that
enjoy
cheap
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
discover
i
could
actually
enjoy
a
can
sure
it
tastes
a
little
like
cooked
corn
and
white
bread
but
its
smooth
enough
without
any
offflavors
i
figure
dmscorn
adjunct
is
acceptable
for
the
style
its
simple
its
kinda
tasty
its
not
that
bad
i
said
a
clear
pale
golden
color
pour
with
a
two
finger
short
lasting
foamy
white
head
high
carbonation
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
with
some
actual
hop
notes
faint
but
thewre
flavor
is
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
a
nice
tiny
hop
note
in
there
crisp
clean
finish
and
mouthfeel
light
body
very
sessionable
and
non
offensive
for
the
style
notes
i
would
definitely
classify
this
as
a
premium
american
adjunct
lager
it
is
miles
above
any
bmc
product
in
this
category
the
fact
that
you
can
actual
taste
and
smell
the
hops
combined
with
the
normal
beer
looking
head
instead
of
sodalike
makes
it
memorable
local
bar
in
town
was
selling
6
strohs
in
an
ice
bucket
figured
id
give
it
a
try
i
had
been
surprised
at
how
well
i
liked
schlitz
and
strohs
like
schlitz
had
been
bought
out
by
pabst
i
was
surprised
had
a
really
good
taste
a
friend
with
me
said
it
is
much
better
than
miller
or
bud
i
have
to
say
i
enjoy
the
schlitz
better
for
one
reason
after
a
couple
of
beers
the
strohs
was
heavier
on
the
stomach
but
overall
taste
was
good
and
id
drink
it
again
6
cans
of
strohs
on
ice
beats
miller
or
bud
on
tap
anyday
dont
expect
much
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
its
cheap
beer
after
all
d
more
flavorful
than
most
others
in
the
style
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representative
of
a
lackluster
style
if
i
were
forced
to
drink
pick
a
beer
in
this
style
to
drink
this
one
would
be
at
the
top
of
that
list
i
have
two
different
standards
for
evaluating
beer
the
first
involves
new
or
interesting
brews
and
is
not
applicable
to
strohs
the
second
applies
to
older
brands
and
american
mass
brews
and
it
is
to
ask
whether
the
beer
in
question
tastes
and
feels
like
the
first
beer
i
sipped
from
a
crockery
mug
while
sitting
on
my
mothers
knee
many
many
years
ago
does
it
havebeer
flavor
more
tha
any
american
beer
i
know
strohs
gets
high
marks
forbeer
flavor
and
i
rate
it
highly
d
for
what
it
is
i
would
say
that
it
is
highly
drinkable
not
bursting
with
flavor
but
it
is
incredibly
smooth
and
nonoffensive
mouthfeel
was
pretty
watery
but
honestly
that
is
what
i
expected
at
less
than
8
for
a
15
pack
my
expectations
werent
all
that
high
all
i
know
is
that
this
is
a
better
choice
than
some
of
the
other
cheap
adjunct
lagers
in
the
beercave
at
the
local
gas
station
and
on
a
warm
summer
day
tending
the
bbq
grill
this
beer
does
the
trick
not
bad
to
quaf
on
a
hot
day
almost
pale
yellow
with
an
airy
finger
of
pure
white
head
the
smell
is
cereal
grain
with
a
whiff
of
lemony
hops
this
beer
is
simple
but
good
toasted
grain
a
slight
corny
sweetness
and
squeaky
clean
in
the
finish
smooth
carbonation
and
medium
light
bodied
this
beer
is
honestly
much
better
than
any
of
the
bmc
light
beer
crap
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
drinkability
while
this
isnt
awful
i
would
prefer
something
else
there
are
even
other
adjunct
lagers
that
i
feel
are
better
than
this
one
drinkability
is
good
for
an
american
lager
for
a
nonlight
beer
it
has
a
lighter
feel
to
it
than
most
normal
lagers
there
is
a
good
solid
taste
that
keeps
you
drinking
without
overwhelming
you
d
could
chug
it
as
a
thirst
quencher
but
other
than
that
its
only
a
hand
or
two
above
the
big
guys
d
very
light
bodied
and
airy
in
feel
yet
there
is
still
a
crisp
structure
here
its
totally
and
brainlessly
poundable
and
more
or
less
everything
a
lowermiddle
rung
macro
needs
to
be
inoffensive
and
thirstbusting
and
inexpensive
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
light
pilsner
malt
and
adjunct
scent
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
there
is
little
hop
aroma
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
below
average
it
has
a
weak
and
watery
mlat
flavor
thats
really
telling
of
the
amount
of
adjuncts
present
its
a
quick
drinker
with
a
dry
musty
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
below
average
as
well
its
a
low
bodied
beer
with
tons
of
carbonation
this
is
a
forgettable
brew
and
very
low
on
my
list
of
top
macro
lagers
poured
from
a
can
into
a
weizen
glass
very
pale
yellow
color
with
virtually
no
head
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
either
the
taste
was
very
light
and
watery
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
good
beer
for
chugging
on
a
hot
day
but
not
a
good
tasting
beer
at
3
39
for
a
sixpack
i
cant
complain
to
much
all
in
all
a
good
choice
comparable
to
pabst
or
miller
high
life
a
surprising
change
on
the
mouthfeel
almost
makes
this
beer
feel
substantial
definetely
taste
light
hops
very
clean
and
crisp
lager
nothing
glamorous
nothing
horrible
a
solid
cheap
macro
that
is
good
for
tipping
a
few
back
one
of
those
beers
when
you
dont
want
anything
too
complicated
drinkability
this
one
is
what
it
is
and
what
is
it
is
not
very
good
but
probably
average
or
a
little
above
for
the
style
so
ill
give
it
that
as
well
as
that
its
probably
4
abv
or
something
like
that
its
good
to
try
these
old
world
american
lagers
though
its
sad
that
they
were
likely
at
one
point
much
much
better
drinkability
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
m
d
a
sharp
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
foaminess
on
the
way
down
body
has
a
little
bit
to
it
at
least
for
the
style
its
unfortunate
that
the
flavour
seems
to
go
downhill
so
quickly
it
could
have
potential
as
a
lawnmower
beer
but
this
is
more
a
choice
to
simply
get
drunk
and
guzzle
this
is
my
lawn
mowing
beer
pours
very
light
gold
heads
quickly
and
fades
slight
hops
smell
and
clean
taste
after
an
hour
pushing
the
lawn
mower
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
two
or
three
of
this
is
a
good
thirst
quencher
costs
only
a
little
more
than
bottled
water
bright
yellow
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
small
head
of
foam
it
has
a
lightly
malted
flavour
with
a
pretty
nice
hop
bite
easy
to
drink
and
cheapfor
here
at
4
a
six
pack
a
pretty
good
value
for
what
you
get
imo
and
would
certainly
pass
as
a
good
summer
time
thirst
quencher
sampled
on
new
years
day
2009
and
poured
from
can
no
12018e50503
this
used
to
be
available
everywhere
in
new
hampshire
but
now
it
is
a
challenge
to
find
it
however
the
local
distributor
must
be
doing
some
kind
of
push
because
i
am
seeing
more
of
it
it
pours
a
carbonated
yellow
tone
with
fizzy
white
head
that
bubbles
lively
and
then
slowly
diminishes
during
the
course
of
the
tasting
aroma
is
grassy
and
metallic
the
taste
is
slightly
bolder
than
most
macros
and
finishes
on
the
dry
side
this
is
pretty
typical
of
american
macros
you
either
like
em
or
hate
em
this
is
more
tolerable
on
my
wallet
at
2
99
a
six
pack
d
some
of
the
other
reviewers
for
this
beer
compare
it
to
pbr
and
i
dont
think
thats
very
far
off
the
mark
compared
to
pabst
its
a
bit
maltier
and
not
quite
as
bitter
so
pick
your
poison
i
guess
very
drinkable
as
an
inoffensive
throwback
beer
and
obviously
quite
affordable
plus
the
cans
have
an
awesome
design
id
put
this
on
par
with
bud
pbr
and
high
life
atop
the
dubious
macro
throne
at
this
point
yikes
the
firebrewed
disaster
nearly
clear
with
a
hint
of
yellow
paper
metal
ash
and
bum
urine
in
the
nose
bizarre
sourmetallic
taste
throughout
must
be
the
firebrewing
just
terrible
you
are
high
if
you
think
this
beer
is
anywhere
above
a
d
d
a
purported
stepup
beer
from
our
friends
at
pabst
not
really
any
better
than
pbr
and
therefore
not
worth
the
premium
over
it
overall
for
the
price
i
paid
for
this
i
can
do
much
better
it
did
however
serve
its
purpose
for
washing
down
chips
dip
wings
and
pizza
if
your
sitting
around
with
your
buddies
just
shootin
the
shit
and
consuming
anything
of
a
salty
nature
this
beer
will
do
the
trick
id
say
give
it
a
try
it
really
isnt
that
bad
yes
yes
im
definitely
not
a
beer
connoisseur
as
of
yet
im
a
bloody
19
year
old
kid
so
at
least
im
somewhat
prone
to
drinking
this
right
pabst
this
pabst
that
i
like
pbr
too
but
for
the
price
and
taste
this
really
is
the
best
american
macro
lager
out
there
no
questions
asked
i
too
think
most
products
from
pabst
well
miller
taste
similar
but
strohs
really
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
even
though
i
acknowlege
this
isnt
the
premier
league
when
it
comes
to
beer
actually
this
tastes
similar
to
pabst
except
that
this
seems
to
have
a
little
more
taste
going
down
and
it
has
a
more
bitter
but
cleaner
aftertaste
when
compared
to
pbr
really
be
grateful
that
this
is
still
being
sold
in
some
parts
of
the
country
if
youre
gonna
get
a
macro
american
lager
check
out
strohs
it
really
is
the
most
earnest
in
price
and
taste
keep
it
alive
i
cant
believe
they
still
make
this
stuff
well
i
can
actually
as
long
as
people
drink
like
my
departed
grandfather
and
my
uncle
there
will
be
a
market
for
this
upper
end
cheap
macro
gave
it
a
3
just
because
i
didnt
pour
it
out
into
a
glass
of
course
the
can
smelled
metallic
but
also
like
dewey
grass
and
grainy
adjuncts
despite
its
wateriness
there
was
some
sweetness
in
this
otherwise
pale
immitation
of
a
real
beer
it
is
a
real
american
macro
though
not
harsh
at
all
on
the
aftertaste
and
in
fact
goes
down
smooth
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
people
my
age
pass
over
for
bud
or
natty
or
corona
at
a
bbq
but
people
the
generation
or
2
above
us
take
that
is
what
it
is
a
light
drinking
summer
beer
really
pours
a
average
golden
urine
color
with
a
three
finger
tall
fizzy
white
head
that
is
less
than
impressiveleaving
behind
zero
lacing
the
nose
is
grainy
and
just
a
tad
peppery
with
some
faint
earthy
hop
aromas
this
is
a
pretty
good
macro
when
it
comes
to
flavorthat
being
that
it
actually
has
some
flavornot
an
abundancebut
more
than
normal
mostly
malty
and
grainy
tastes
a
little
like
pringles
potatoe
chipswith
some
grassy
notes
on
the
tail
the
body
is
lightand
the
finish
is
clean
and
refreshing
well
what
can
i
say
this
is
my
every
day
beer
when
i
go
to
the
store
to
buy
a
30
pack
to
restock
my
fridge
strohs
is
my
old
stand
by
my
best
friends
uncle
got
me
hooked
on
this
a
few
years
ago
the
great
part
about
strohs
is
that
along
with
being
the
best
tasting
american
swill
around
here
is
that
it
is
also
very
cheap
compared
to
budweiser
coors
and
miller
the
only
downfall
is
that
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
find
so
i
am
forced
to
buy
it
at
room
temperature
at
the
local
grocery
store
things
could
be
worse
oh
by
the
way
around
here
we
call
it
by
its
name
if
you
spell
it
backwards
may
the
shorts
be
with
ya
d
im
floored
by
this
one
if
i
could
find
this
more
easily
this
would
be
my
cheap
fall
back
session
lager
of
choice
i
currently
drink
pbr
or
old
milwaukee
strangely
both
heilman
brews
when
i
just
want
to
drink
four
or
five
beers
with
my
buddies
on
the
cheap
good
stuff
for
what
it
is
drink
very
good
no
harsh
a
good
recommendation
for
strohs
overall
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
underrated
amongst
its
american
macro
lager
peers
a
nice
addition
to
any
cook
out
or
to
quench
your
thirst
after
chasing
your
dog
around
the
neighborhood
pale
yellow
colored
beer
with
the
expected
macro
taste
and
and
aroma
goes
down
smooth
and
has
no
offensive
aftertaste
another
one
of
those
beers
i
drank
as
a
youngster
and
will
continue
to
drink
in
the
future
its
good
on
the
palate
and
on
the
wallet
i
recommend
and
will
purchase
again
today
i
got
a
rocky
bonewhite
head
from
the
pour
with
good
retention
throughout
the
color
was
a
light
yellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
the
nose
was
somewhat
sweet
nowhere
near
as
bitter
as
i
remember
it
as
being
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
there
was
very
little
flavor
associated
with
this
beer
it
was
very
bland
even
more
than
the
corona
that
i
had
consumed
a
little
while
previously
to
think
that
this
was
what
used
to
routinely
kick
my
sixteen
yearold
ass
no
wonder
my
pops
used
to
laugh
at
all
of
us
bill
badass
wannabes
the
finish
had
a
slight
metallic
aspect
im
done
with
strohs
after
this
shorts
on
the
other
hand
now
theres
some
good
beer
yep
that
pretty
much
sums
it
all
up
if
youre
going
macrolager
and
want
to
get
a
good
laugh
from
your
buddies
this
is
a
mustbuy
often
overlooked
in
college
towns
alike
strohs
is
the
redheaded
stepchild
of
yellow
fizzy
beers
and
for
good
reason
at
least
the
others
go
down
smooth
or
taste
enough
like
water
to
get
you
by
but
no
strohs
affirms
its
place
as
party
pooper
emphasis
on
the
poop
right
in
your
mouth
get
it
for
a
good
laugh
but
youll
soon
reconsider
your
drink
to
get
drunk
binge
drinking
ways
this
was
my
dads
beer
of
choice
so
its
my
goto
when
im
feeling
old
school
im
told
it
used
to
be
better
when
they
still
firebrewed
it
though
i
havent
a
clue
if
thats
just
the
nostalgia
talking
drinkability
nothing
special
okay
if
you
want
a
cheaply
priced
beer
i
remember
going
the
stroh
brewery
in
detroit
back
in
the
early
nineties
for
my
first
ever
real
beer
tasting
i
never
grew
up
in
the
detroit
area
but
remember
many
of
my
friends
who
were
from
there
their
parents
always
had
this
stuff
in
their
fridges
nostalgia
play
a
part
in
my
slight
fondness
for
this
beer
but
truth
be
told
its
really
not
a
bad
macro
lager
d
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
at
the
end
of
the
eco
section
in
the
store
i
poured
the
longneck
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
decent
golden
color
not
much
head
it
faded
quickly
smells
better
than
budweiser
or
any
other
american
macro
that
i
can
think
of
hints
of
hops
malt
tastes
pretty
good
for
a
cheap
beer
probably
better
than
any
cheap
beer
that
i
can
think
of
growing
up
in
the
detroit
area
this
was
the
beer
my
old
man
drank
it
from
his
youth
and
continues
to
drink
it
today
this
is
about
the
best
3
99
six
pack
of
longnecks
out
there
the
30
pack
for
12
99
inticed
me
it
had
the
look
of
a
typical
american
lager
but
oh
my
god
it
was
like
drinking
ohio
river
water
with
a
hint
of
dead
carp
i
could
tell
that
there
was
a
hint
of
hops
but
it
was
over
powered
by
the
unfavorable
hint
of
mint
where
the
hell
did
that
come
from
never
again
will
i
consume
a
beer
that
had
absolutely
no
hint
of
flavor
except
the
morning
after
need
to
brush
my
tongue
and
apologize
to
my
wife
for
drinking
it
damn
this
might
be
the
most
watery
thinass
beer
ive
ever
had
except
for
strohs
light
of
course
it
has
the
pale
yellow
color
with
no
head
but
its
difficult
to
even
find
carbonation
in
this
one
they
could
of
atleast
gave
us
something
in
this
beer
to
enjoy
your
better
off
tossing
the
last
14
of
the
beer
and
grabbing
a
new
one
as
is
just
gets
worse
and
worse
the
further
into
the
can
you
go
my
cuttoff
limit
is
usually
the
whole
damn
thing
but
for
this
beer
i
cant
even
finish
the
whole
can
without
being
damn
well
sick
and
tired
of
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
expected
to
feel
fizzy
in
the
mouth
and
light
bodied
and
it
is
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
one
could
drink
this
all
night
however
i
think
that
there
are
better
macros
out
there
why
someone
would
want
to
regularly
drink
this
for
any
reason
but
to
get
drunk
is
beyond
me
a
good
beer
excellent
for
mowing
yard
work
and
hanging
around
certainly
not
like
bigfoot
decent
head
minimal
lacing
crisp
smell
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
hops
are
more
noticeable
in
the
taste
really
nice
american
lager
makes
bud
look
like
the
crap
it
is
a
bargain
wherever
you
buy
it
my
only
macro
beermaybe
amber
bock
too
me
and
my
friends
used
to
drink
this
during
our
college
days
in
pittsburgh
the
fine
years
of
88
to
90
i
think
strohs
was
the
first
to
do
the
30pack
please
correct
me
if
im
wrong
what
brought
me
back
was
a
few
years
ago
consumer
reports
rated
all
of
the
domestic
beers
and
strohs
won
i
was
like
wtf
really
so
i
bought
a
30pack
of
cans
and
wow
was
i
surprised
not
the
crap
beer
that
i
remembered
but
a
decent
smooth
american
lager
my
friends
laughed
in
my
face
when
i
told
them
i
was
drinking
it
again
ah
well
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
color
good
foam
and
lacing
taste
is
above
average
for
a
macro
a
great
session
beer
and
the
price
15
for
a
30
pack
tough
to
beat
this
is
a
great
one
to
just
have
on
hand
for
whenever
you
need
a
good
after
a
long
workday
beer
light
smell
and
not
as
bad
as
i
would
have
expected
taste
is
light
but
there
is
some
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
taste
than
most
maintream
brews
easy
to
sip
down
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
i
can
see
why
people
can
put
down
so
many
of
these
things
while
mowing
the
lawn
or
fishing
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
for
a
macro
this
isnt
half
bad
i
think
that
its
a
beer
ill
have
around
for
nights
that
ive
already
have
had
a
few
well
this
isnt
the
worst
macro
ive
had
its
certainly
smoother
than
your
standard
fare
corn
cereal
and
a
slight
sour
taste
dominate
the
flavor
all
that
said
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
ok
not
overly
fizzy
surprisingly
and
the
finish
is
tolerable
really
this
is
an
ok
beer
for
barbecuing
on
a
lazy
summer
day
but
not
something
id
have
regularly
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
but
the
beer
is
predictably
light
bodied
carbonation
is
a
little
heavy
handed
but
not
too
bad
it
improves
on
the
bud
by
providing
some
flavor
for
the
carbonation
to
contend
with
i
tend
to
go
with
the
strohs
simply
because
there
is
some
flavor
to
experience
even
if
it
isnt
very
good
my
comparison
tonight
reinfoces
this
idea
but
i
may
be
more
prone
to
buying
high
life
for
occasions
of
easy
summer
swilling
i
tend
to
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
some
of
the
retro
beers
pbr
high
life
olde
style
schlitz
etc
i
remember
drinking
fire
brewed
strohs
on
tap
during
a
beach
trip
after
my
freshman
year
of
college
i
have
to
say
like
many
of
the
aforementioned
granddad
beers
it
has
much
more
taste
and
character
than
bmc
the
color
and
carbonation
was
right
on
for
american
lager
the
smell
was
mostly
corn
but
enough
malt
to
note
taste
was
more
of
the
same
but
really
pretty
pleasing
considering
the
style
mouthfeel
was
fine
again
relative
to
style
and
the
drinkability
was
very
high
it
is
no
longer
sold
in
my
local
market
and
i
was
glad
to
have
found
some
on
a
recent
roadtrip
in
a
30
pack
for
12
bucks
definitely
a
better
bargain
than
most
macros
if
only
it
still
said
firebrewed
whatever
the
hell
that
means
i
had
my
first
strohs
when
i
was
in
basic
training
at
fort
knox
in
1969
at
that
time
it
was
still
advertised
as
fire
brewed
and
was
made
at
the
original
stroh
brewery
since
then
strohs
has
been
literally
around
the
block
and
has
turned
up
as
a
quite
average
beer
among
many
made
in
milwaukee
but
like
many
of
my
memories
of
3
cases
of
backyard
fence
beer
for
7
50
strohs
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
if
only
due
to
that
first
bottle
at
the
px
at
fort
knox
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
much
better
than
any
other
macro
i
have
tried
drinkability
is
high
with
this
one
strohs
in
a
can
why
not
lets
do
this
appears
a
golden
clear
bubbly
quote
unquote
beer
look
to
it
with
large
heavily
carbonated
bright
white
head
floating
above
body
dwindling
at
a
moderate
pace
leaves
some
nice
patches
of
sporadic
lacing
around
my
duvel
chalice
sorry
duvel
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
cooked
veggie
quality
often
described
with
these
types
of
brews
mild
corn
sweetness
something
gives
me
the
notion
that
theres
just
a
touch
of
mild
hop
herbal
quality
going
on
which
says
alot
when
compared
to
most
american
light
lagers
taste
not
overly
sweet
definitely
ridden
with
adjuncts
but
its
somewhat
enjoyable
combo
of
mild
sweetness
with
corn
and
rice
finish
and
a
light
herbal
undertow
of
hop
flavor
not
much
bitterness
of
course
but
balanced
and
finishes
with
a
touch
of
offness
grainymetallic
combo
while
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
solid
all
around
american
or
old
timer
beer
im
proud
to
still
be
able
to
drink
this
over
bud
miller
coors
just
to
be
different
sometimes
you
get
enjoyment
with
that
as
far
as
the
mouthfeel
goes
its
light
bodied
heavy
with
the
carbonation
prepare
to
say
excuse
me
honey
and
yeah
i
know
this
one
doesnt
smell
as
good
as
my
usual
ipas
but
come
on
our
grandfathers
drank
a
version
of
this
beer
this
has
a
nice
alcohol
bitein
that
it
has
it
then
it
doesnt
unlike
pbr
second
to
schlitz
on
my
under
3
99sixthatillbuy
grainy
watered
down
obviously
but
decent
gold
color
with
more
flavor
than
most
in
the
genre
excellent
for
cooking
beer
brats
beer
chickenetc
i
dont
know
why
but
this
is
my
preferred
beer
for
cooking
also
makes
mean
beer
batter
relatively
low
on
the
adjuncts
compared
to
bud
lightbuschbusch
lt
it
was
better
for
some
reason
about
15
yrs
ago
maybe
its
my
memory
or
i
think
someone
said
it
used
to
be
firebrewed
maybe
thats
it
maybe
its
the
stronger
aroma
and
flavor
than
that
of
its
competitiors
that
i
like
unlike
natty
when
you
drink
strohs
at
least
you
know
youre
drinkin
beer
now
this
one
is
for
sipping
around
the
campfire
all
night
and
the
can
is
pretty
too
i
was
buying
this
for
9
99
per
30pk
before
it
got
all
popular
or
something
clean
with
corn
and
some
burpy
rice
watery
to
quench
that
thirst
born
of
a
long
day
on
the
assembly
line
no
aroma
i
noticed
no
finish
save
a
trace
of
thin
grain
water
nice
looking
can
strohs
pours
your
typical
deep
yellow
with
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
mild
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
grain
mouthfeel
is
light
with
nice
carbonation
that
isnt
flat
or
fizzy
its
right
in
the
middle
the
taste
is
good
with
sweet
malts
on
the
tongue
not
fizzy
followed
by
a
finish
with
decent
hop
presence
and
a
litte
sweetness
not
much
complexity
at
all
but
certainly
nothing
that
would
offend
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
directly
from
the
can
as
is
pbr
and
schlitz
another
one
that
is
so
much
better
than
the
big

pretty

for

beer
typical
of
american
macro
lagers
in
that
it
has
a
pronounced
pilsner
malt
base
that
shows
moderately
high
grain
flavors
lightened
body
straw
colors
and
lacking

retention
a
bit
special
in
a

adds
to
the
refreshing
quality
quite
efforvescent
on
the
toung
and
dry
in
the
finish
though
not
a
great
beer
i
have
had
worse
from
some
good
craft
breweries
somewhat
muted
golden
color
thin
foamy
white
had
that
is
gone
in

even

like
that
some
macros
are
slight
malty

with
a
decent
grainy
tinge
to
it
just
a
slight
bitterness
to
be
found
decent
enough
mouthfeeltheres
not
much
there
it
does
hold
up
well
considering
the
style
above
average
drinkabilityhas
a
slight
snap
to
it
which
i
like
in
a
macro
i
am
all
over
it
for
hot
summer
drinkingand
i
love
to
point
out
that
strohs
spelled
backwards
is
shorts
i
havent
yet
entered
the
scores
but
it
looks
as
though
pabst
blue
ribbon
will
take
the
blue
ribbon
in
macro
smackdown
x
by
a
slight
margin
thats
not
to
say
that
strohs
is
a
dog
if
matched
against
almost
any
beer
in
the
macsmack
series
it
would
probably
emerge
victorious
im
surprised
and
pleased
by
both
of
these
old
school
brews
this
is
a
very
malty
brew
for
the
style
and
has
a
slightly
buttery
wheat
bread
taste
balanced
by
a
zippy
bitter
that
slides
in
smoothly
and
leaves
a
crackery
finish
it
is
mid
bodied
with
a
soft
carbonation
that
slowly
creeps
in
intensity
and
drinkability
is
limited
only
by
a
full
feeling
in
the
gut
this
may
be
the
best
macro
lager
ive
had
i
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
i
would
love
to
try
the
strohs
dark
i
didnt
even
know
strohs
made
a
dark
and
i
would
bet
its
a
step
up
strohs
is
a
beer
i
used
to
drink
many
moons
ago
it
was
a
beer
me
and
the
guys
could
all
agree
on
i
was
surprised
to
find
it
was
still
in
production
and
just
had
to
try
it
though
my
taste
has
changed
i
was
not
nearly
as
disapointed
in
this
old
beer
as
i
have
been
in
others
i
have
gone
back
and
tried
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
my
younger
days
and
i
havent
seen
it
since
i
moved
to
houston
its
really
not
a
bad
or
offensive
beer
but
better
cheap
beers
are
available
high
life
schlitz
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
either
bottom
line
beats
the
hell
out
of
bmc
the
mouth
is
a
trifle
thin
but
the
drinkablity
is
surprisingly
strong
i
would
love
to
find
this
on
tap
or
bottle
i
have
some
fond
memories
of
getting
16oz
returnable
bottles
of
this
back
in
college
i
suppose
i
can
buy
a
dozen
of
these
average
beers
many
are
cheaper
strohs
has
an
edge
a
slight
bit
on
flavor
but
it
seems
to
be
on
par
with
every
other
macro
lager
so
average
drinkability
i
did
enjoy
it
a
bit
better
from
the
bottle
ah
good
old
strohs
cheap
and
solid
clear
medium
yellow
with
a
medium
sized
white
foamy
slowly
diminishing
head
grainy
nose
with
a
light
hops
presence
thats
rather
good
for
a
cheapo
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
crisp
some
more
weak
malt
light
citrus
and
some
doughy
yeast
lightly
sweet
up
front
but
finishes
lightly
dry
it
has
a
thin
body
slightly
oily
in
a
good
way
texture
and
moderate
to
lively
carbonation
i
bought
a
case
of
this
for
pretty
cheap
and
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
its
nothing
special
but
among
the
domestic
macros
i
rank
it
high
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
a
foam
that
came
up
very
fast
and
dissipated
very
fast
leaving
a
small
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
that
of
sweet
grains
and
malt
with
an
alcohol
aroma
in
the
background
the
taste
was
that
of
bland
hops
and
malts
with
a
light
sweet
and
watery
mouthfeel
since
the
taste
was
bland
this
will
go
down
nice
and
smooth
since
this
beer
is
cheap
you
can
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
had
lawnmower
beer
written
all
over
it
this
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
worst
beers
ever
it
pours
a
poor
yellow
and
some
froth
the
smell
is
crappy
bland
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
the
worst
it
is
so
bad
it
sends
shivers
down
my
spine
just
thinking
about
it
it
starts
lame
and
uninspiring
with
the
taste
of
the
all
to
familiar
cereal
malts
then
comes
the
hops
and
that
adjunct
sweet
taste
oh
sweet
jesus
it
is
camo
all
over
again
luckily
it
is
a
very
watery
beer
so
it
is
just
drinkable
enough
to
chug
and
get
over
with
back
in
the
late
70s
this
was
my
favorite
beer
how
could
you
pass
up
a
beer
that
was
fire
brewed
whatever
that
means
lets
give
it
another
try
almost
30
years
later
poured
a
nonimpressive
pale
yellow
color
with
modet
white
head
that
fell
to
a
thin
ring
but
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
virtually
nonexistent
taste
is
also
very
minimal
but
at
least
not
disgusting
finishes
easy
and
refreshing
good
as
a
spacer
lawnmower
beer
or
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
pair
with
spicy
wings
an
american
lager
made
by
pabst
breweries
of
san
antonio
texas
in
general
is
like
a
few
of
mexican
beers
worst
to
drink
appearance
taste
and
drinkability
are
not
for
me
its
adjoincts
of
rice
and
grains
give
an
awful
flavor
mouthfeel
is
low
in
the
average
good
for
the
mexican
food
25
recommended
this
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
yellow
kind
of
similar
to
honey
with
a
small
and
shortlived
white
head
it
smells
nice
and
malty
much
better
smelling
than
say
a
budweiser
the
taste
is
good
and
malty
much
like
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
hops
to
balance
it
very
very
good
tasting
for
this
style
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
not
too
carbonated
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
at
7
for
a
15can
suitcase
its
just
about
unbeatable
in
terms
of
value
especially
considering
how
good
it
tastes
this
beer
tastes
good
it
seems
to
me
that
this
beer
is
a
combination
of
a
macrobrew
like
a
budweiser
mixed
with
a
quality
stout
this
beer
has
flavor
some
of
that
typical
macrobrew
flavor
but
some
of
that
good
stout
flavor
its
satisying
to
drink
ill
have
more
at
the
bars
in
the
future
the
second
one
i
poured
into
a
glass
to
get
a
look
at
this
beer
a
nice
slightly
darkened
yellow
with
a
fine
white
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
little
while
and
actually
leaves
some
lace
the
smell
is
of
a
malty
lager
there
is
none
of
the
corn
smell
i
was
expecting
the
hops
are
very
muted
though
and
there
is
still
this
cheap
beer
smell
it
has
a
pleasent
taste
i
welcomed
lots
of
malt
and
a
slight
bit
of
complexity
as
it
warms
the
hops
however
are
so
muted
and
dull
that
all
they
add
is
a
little
bitterness
it
does
have
a
full
body
and
i
would
cheap
drink
this
all
night
if
need
be
if
you
review
this
beer
objectively
according
to
style
this
is
pretty
damn
good
no
off
flavors
whatsoever
and
one
of
the
tastiest
macros
ive
ever
had
maybe
the
fact
its
an
all
barley
malt
beer
has
something
to
do
with
it
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
macro
this
would
be
the
one
this
was
a
decent
offering
esp
for
its
price
very
bright
in
color
with
almost
no
head
which
sucked
a
little
aroma
was
grainy
and
basically
like
a
lager
but
nothing
off
about
it
at
all
flavor
is
a
bit
bland
and
mellow
with
wheaty
notes
coming
through
not
really
any
adjunct
taste
or
off
flavors
the
body
was
real
mellow
and
not
all
fizzy
like
most
macros
i
liked
it
better
that
way
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
lingering
just
a
bit
not
sweet
not
dry
but
nice
the
body
is
crisp
and
smooth
quite
refreshing
and
it
goes
down
easy
light
gold
with
one
finger
head
poor
head
retention
but
nice
lacing
aroma
and
taste
are
a
pleasent
balance
of
malt
and
hops
smooth
and
the
crisp
bite
that
is
familiar
to
the
allmalt
lager
style
pabst
brewing
company
excells
at
making
affordable
session
beer
with
above
average
flavor
while
not
very
different
than
your
american
macro
the
absence
of
adjunct
malts
and
smooth
drinkability
make
it
superior
even
to
other
popular
allmalt
lagers
the
drinkablilty
of
this
beer
was
quite
good
i
could
drink
this
all
night
with
some
friends
around
a
camp
fire
strohs
is
hard
to
find
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
but
i
always
pick
some
up
when
i
see
it
at
less
than
5
50
for
12
short
necks
this
beer
blows
the
big
three
away
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
good
size
head
the
crisp
clean
aroma
is
nicely
balanced
between
the
malt
and
hops
sweet
malty
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
an
excellent
lawn
mower
beer
clean
crisp
and
slightly
dry
on
the
finish

final

to

for
a
cheap
ol
macro
not
terribly
bad
sure
fizzy
yellow
fast
disappearing

no
aroma

but
the
taste
was
somewhat
malty
behind
the
corn
if
some
guy
gave
me
one
i
would
finish
it
off
but
i
wouldnt
buy
any
except
for
the
one

not
a

there
moderate
in
quantity
aroma
is
all
corn
and
a

too
this
tastes
to
me
the
way
old
mil
used
to
taste
to
me
when
i
was
a
youngin
very
bluntly
sweet
and
grainy
the
mouthfeel
isnt
quite
as
fizzy
as
most
macros
but
rather
subdued
in
its
carbonation
not
one
im
gonna
hit
up
again
and
again
okay
this
was
the
cheapest
beer
available
and
since
i
havent
reviewed
it
yet
not
a
good
excuse
i
havent
had
a
strohs
since
my
freshman
year
in
college
when
we
hosted
a
huge
party
and
bought
15
cases
of
this
stuff
to
the
dismay
of
some
it
took
all
year
to
finish
it
off
not
as
good
as
a
miller
lite
but
ive
had
much
worse
still
a
good
choice
for
a
college
party
9
years
after
the
fact
pours
light
gold
in
color
which
is
pretty
good
for
a
american
macro
a
nice
white
head
which
is
gone
in
less
than
five
minutes
not
much
lacing
in
glass
just
a
bit
more
hops
than
what
normally
find
with
this
style
it
finishes
dry
and
crisp
when
face
with
the
choice
of
drinking
a
macro
vs
not
drinking
beer
at
all
i
choose
this
beer
a
michigan
classic
nice
pale
golden
color
with
a
solid
medium
carbonation
short
lived
head
leaves
a
touch
of
lace
around
the
glass
strong
scents
of
corn
and
barley
are
present
as
well
as
the
presence
of
alcohol
straight
forward
well
made
american
macro
not
what
it
used
to
be
as
i
am
told
by
the
old
timers
but
still
pretty
good
flavors
of
corn
and
grain
not
overpowering
but
not
wimpy
either
recommended
for
lager
lovers
very
light
almost
straw
gold
color
with
a
nice
looking
head
which
fades
to
a
layer
of
tiny
bubbles
smell
what
smell
maybe
a
light
touch
of
grain
but
that
is
it
taste
is
about
as
average
as
you
can
get
malty
but
at
least
its
not
corny
or
overly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
yet
thin
not
bad
for
a
macro
good
for
the
price
edit
it
was
a
can
i
reviewed
not
a
bottle
picked
a
sixer
up
in
mississippi
while
on
vacation
strohs
color
is
golden
yellow
with
an
averagesized
head
aroma
is
very
light
on
the
adjuncts
mainly
a
grassy
sweet
smell
is
noted
the
taste
is
fairly
average
overall
but
very
good
for
a
macro
product
this
is
very
smooth
without
adjunct
nastiness
strohs
flavor
starts
off
crisp
and
finishes
lightly
malty
this
probably
the
best
macro
ive
had
just
a
little
ahead
of
pbr
i
wish
i
could
get
this
in
houston
i
would
make
it
my
standard
lawnmower
beer
i
admit
a
bit
of
nostalgiac
feeling
toward
strohs
it
was
my
goto
beer
of
choice
during
college
when
my
wallet
was
a
bit
thin
it
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
few
minutes
and
even
manages
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
pale
malt
with
a
slightly
mineral
undertone
the
taste
is
again
malty
with
some
crisp
hops
bitterness
providing
balance
but
never
usurping
the
malt
thankfully
and
surprisingly
the
adjunct
flavors
which
dominate
other
macroswill
are
absent
here
a
great
value
id
choose
this
over
other
macroswill
in
a
heartbeat
on
a
hot
day
or
any
other
i
give
this
brew
a
slight
edge
over
miller
high
life
but
both
are
tops
in
cheap
u
s
macros
verdict
wow
ive
been
on
a
bit
of
a
macro
kick
lately
and
drinking
a
strohs
so
soon
after
drinking
a
budweiser
really
puts
this
beer
into
perspective
while
this
certainly
isnt
a
standout
beer
by
ba
standards
its
a
fantastic
budget
beer
that
tastes
way
better
than
it
has
any
right
to
nothing
to
see
here
folks
just
move
along
quitely
to
pleasanter
things
i
used
to
buy
keystone
light
in
college
because
it
was
always
10
for
a
30
pack
when
the
tax
on
alcohol
was
increased
i
hate
government
i
could
no
longer
spend
10
for
a
30
pack
of
stones
but
there
was
yet
another
beer
strohs
i
picked
up
a
30
of
this
and
started
drinking
a
few
while
playing
my
game
cube
a
few
easily
turned
into
8
or
more
as
there
were
cans
all
over
the
room
before
i
realized
it
the
beer
is
quite
tastey
for
what
it
is
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
but
much
more
flavor
than
stones
your
typical
lager
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
some
sweet
corn
flavors
and
a
slight
aluminum
taste
the
can
is
pretty
cool
looking
as
well
i
dont
mind
the
smell
but
many
girls
have
told
me
that
this
aweful
beer
smells
like
st
when
i
crack
open
a
can
pours
a
threefingered
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
clear
light
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
slightly
sweet
and
clean
tastes
like
a
light
good
lawnmower
beer
1
00
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
liquorbarn
lexington
ky
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
definately
not
great
very
average
but
for
the
price
its
a
good
deal
would
be
good
for
hot
summer
days
when
you
just
want
something
cheap
and
wet
this
beer
is
the
best
you
can
get
for
the
money
i
mean
anything
that
beats
the
hell
out
of
bud
miller
coors
etc
and
comes
in
a
30
pack
for
a
few
bucks
less
than
most
24s
is
a
sure
thing
im
a
poor
college
student
and
this
is
what
i
pick
up
all
the
time
when
i
want
to
chill
and
have
some
cheap
brews
pours
slightly
darker
than
pale
straw
big
white
head
that
quickly
runs
and
hides
but
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
behind
aroma
is
grassy
earthy
tiny
bit
of
hops
and
some
cardboard
flavor
is
sweet
a
bit
grassy
some
smokey
apple
and
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
thin
body
crisp
and
refreshing
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
although
it
seems
to
have
more
hops
than
the
typical
as
lager
i
was
looking
for
a
beer
thats
been
around
awhile
but
not
as
big
as
the
major
macs
strohs
came
to
mind
after
seeing
it
that
its
been
around
since
i
was
a
kid
i
had
to
search
alittle
for
the
bottle
cans
are
plenty
im
glad
i
found
it
an
american
classic
thats
easy
to
drink
and
affordable
no
major
standouts
about
it
pours
a
pure
gold
medium
carbonation
a
white
notfizzy
head
with
little
lace
taste
is
grassy
grain
slight
hopmaltbut
a
hint
of
sweetness
a
crisp
beer
that
goes
well
with
about
anything
thats
not
as
big
as
the
macs
but
yet
been
around
forever
and
it
wont
break
the
bank
this
is
a
very
drinkable
cheap
beer
at
6
a
15
pack
it
was
right
next
to
the
pbr
so
i
could
kind
of
figure
out
what
of
brew
it
was
i
was
skeptical
but
as
the
saying
goes
curiousity
didnt
kill
the
cat
well
it
was
a
little
different
from
that
but
you
get
the
idea
in
a
town
where
natty
and
bud
rule
its
good
to
finally
have
a
change
of
pave
from
the
usual
swill
its
apperance
wasnt
that
amazing
and
neither
was
the
smell
infact
i
really
didnt
smell
that
much
the
taste
was
light
on
the
hops
almost
no
hops
that
i
tasted
but
had
a
bit
of
a
honey
taste
to
it
thats
something
that
most
cheap
beers
do
not
possess
what
else
more
can
i
say
sure
its
no
weste
but
its
good
and
i
like
it
light
clear
gold
slightly
darker
than
straw
refuge
adjunct
head
of
big
thin
bubbles
and
no
lace
generation
malty
aroma
a
little
corn
husk
in
character
flavor
profile
is
based
on
maltiness
a
little
karo
syrup
nondescript
but
fairly
smooth
and
inoffensive
the
finish
falls
down
to
me
not
really
hoppy
but
a
metallic
bitterness
that
might
actually
indicate
that
but
thats
also
emphasized
by
too
much
co2
that
tends
to
shove
it
back
up
your
nasal
passages
ok
beer
not
a
favorite
sorry
proc
as
far
as
american
macrobrewed
beers
are
concerned
strohs
is
in
my
opinion
among
the
elite
it
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
disappears
way
too
quickly
lacing
is
sparse
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
grainy
husky
metallic
and
mildly
hoppy
there
are
some
hops
lingering
to
be
sure
but
a
malt
character
is
hard
to
detect
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
rather
mellow
and
pleasant
with
notes
of
grain
corn
hops
and
pale
malts
the
finish
is
crisp
fairly
clean
and
inoffensive
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
prickly
and
carbonated
but
not
overly
so
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
and
is
a
costeffective
lawnmower
beer
if
there
was
such
a
thing
it
would
also
work
wonderfully
for
beermarinated
bratwurst
on
the
grill
give
it
a
try
maybe
the
best
beer
youll
find
for
less
than
4
a
six
pack
as
far
as
beers
go
that
you
buy
in
packs
of
30
this
isnt
the
worst
one
that
you
can
come
across
its
pretty
much
your
basic
macro
brew
but
it
lacks
the
extreme
shittiness
that
most
of
them
have
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
outside
or
something
along
those
lines
this
would
be
a
decent
choice
on
an
aside
when
i
first
enjoyed
this
beer
my
buddy
and
i
saw
the
beer
episode
of
modern
marvels
on
the
history
channel
several
of
the
pictures
they
showed
during
the
program
were
of
guys
sitting
on
barrels
of
strohs
imagine
that
the
first
time
you
have
strohs
and
theres
a
bunch
of
hearty
early
1900s
guys
sitting
on
barrels
of
beer
that
probably
taste
a
lot
better
than
what
youre
drinking
oh
well
next
superbowl
american
lager
is
certainly
not
my
favorite
style
but
strohs
remains
my
pick
among
the
megas
not
as
tasty
as
i
remember
it
being
when
it
was
still
an
independent
but
not
offensive
either
not
to
get
carried
away
this
is
a
cheap
thin
lager
but
its
an
exceedingly
drinkable
cheap
thin
lager
much
drier
than
most
corn
or
rice
filled
swills
this
goes
down
easy
and
inoffensive
actually
tastes
like
beer
cheaper
and
better
than
most
macros
or
even
the
typical
premium
euroskunklager
this
beer
is
actually
not
too
shabby
when
compared
to
most
domestic
macroswill
it
is
brilliantly
clear
beautifully
golden
with
peach
accents
forming
a
large
seafoam
white
head
atop
mediumsized
bubbles
carbonation
is
moderate
and
retention
and
lacing
are
actually
pretty
good
ah
the
delectable
aroma
corn
fertilizer
im
not
kidding
rubbery
dirty
hops
alcohol
and
memories
of
throwing
up
on
the
beach
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
thin
body
taste
begins
with
fermentation
by
products
middle
is
mostly
harsh
alcohols
with
lots
of
sugary
sweet
corn
and
the
finish
is
rubbery
hop
extract
licking
the
lips
one
tastes
chemical
bitterness
and
feels
head
retention
agents
delicious
sentimentality
aside
this
is
still
a
decent
beer
like
many
others
whose
first
1000
beers
were
strohs
firebrewed
beer
its
hard
to
forget
the
glory
days
we
loved
this
beer
and
it
still
satisfies
much
the
same
as
it
once
did
it
pours
a
yellow
to
pale
gold
with
a
shortlived
white
head
and
little
lacing
some
hop
and
malt
sensed
in
smell
and
taste
lightbodied
but
less
watery
than
many
macro
brews
of
the
same
ilk
nice
finish
with
some
bitterness
noted
better
than
many
macros
the
quality
is
matched
to
the
price
taste
was
light
slightly
bitter
at
first
followed
by
a
touch
of
sweet
grain
adjunct
taste
was
not
really
evident
in
this
beer
super
fizzy
mouthfeel
which
i
really
did
not
care
for
bulldozed
itself
into
the
mix
overall
impression
of
this
beer
compared
to
its
other
macro
buddies
a
little
more
hoppier
then
average
a
bit
more
bitter
then
most
more
carbonation
then
some
very
light
in
body
hop
heads
could
dig
this
beer
i
suppose
definitely
leans
more
towards
bitter
then
sweet
however
for
me
i
think
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
very
clean
tasting
without
a
doubt
this
was
a
bargain
it
was
flavorful
and
only
7
50
for
a
15pk
great
for
the
style
pours
a
sligthly
darker
gold
than
many
macro
beers
the
bright
white
modest
head
quickly
fades
away
the
aroma
is
faint
and
grainy
the
taste
has
a
touch
of
sweetness
with
a
light
malt
taste
and
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
touch
of
lemon
also
slides
in
the
mouthfeel
is
harsh
with
excessive
carbonation
the
drinkability
well
its
drinkable
but
not
by
much
unlike
most
macors
it
actually
inproves
a
bit
as
it
warms
a
little
however
the
five
that
i
have
left
may
well
be
my
last
for
a
cheap
everyday
beer
ill
stick
to
rock
and
amber
bock
venom
and
proc
can
have
the
strohs
strohs
pours
out
a
clear
pale
light
golden
color
a
big
fizzy
head
works
its
way
up
and
dies
to
nothing
in
record
time
no
lace
and
somewhat
light
carbonation
it
does
have
a
pleasant
grassy
grainy
and
light
malty
aroma
with
a
just
hint
of
hoppiness
sort
of
a
light
but
rough
taste
pretty
grainy
with
more
grassy
flavors
mediumlight
bodied
not
real
sweet
but
dry
no
real
adjunct
obnoxiousness
a
little
spritzy
in
the
finish
i
can
see
why
some
macro
swillers
would
be
turned
off
by
the
dirty
tastes
in
this
lager
this
is
a
macro
with
some
flavors
to
think
about
and
has
some
refreshing
qualities
too
a
step
below
high
life
and
pbr
but
a
step
above
old
mil
and
coors
more
flavor
than
bud
and
mgd
strohs
is
a
cheap
beer
that
doesnt
taste
too
cheap
better
than
the
big
3
and
infinitely
better
than
their
subpremium
brands
has
good
flavor
and
is
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
had
to
strohs
fire
brewed
beer
i
am
more
than
a
little
surprised
at
the
low
rank
this
beer
has
it
is
hands
down
better
than
the
vast
run
of
american
macrolagers
and
in
fact
is
better
than
most
of
the
skunked
out
eurolagers
the
beer
is
slightly
darker
than
most
of
its
ilk
and
i
think
it
has
a
unique
taste
that
certainly
plays
down
whatever
adjuncts
it
may
have
ive
heard
it
has
none
but
i
find
that
hard
to
believe
cripes
in
a
thirty
pack
this
beer
is
well
nigh
unbeatable
except
for
its
stable
mate
pbr
my
college
favorite
always
on
sale
in
the
16oz
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
pay
all
day
the
next
day
on
the
throne
it
gives
you
the
worst
case
of
gasdiheara
it
tastes
cheap
barely
any
hops
or
malt
best
served
cold
this
is
a
below
average
beer
but
at
way
below
average
prices
this
beer
goes
along
with
the
law
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
in
the
case
of
strohs
youre
not
paying
much
so
one
shouldnt
expect
much
either
in
the
cheap
beer
category
its
my
third
or
fourth
choice
pbr
is
much
better
has
a
slight
hoppiness
to
it
but
much
stronger
in
the
malt
department
i
can
see
how
someone
might
like
this
beer
but
not
how
they
could
enjoy
it
it
has
no
appeal
other
than
a
cheap
way
of
getting
loaded
ahh
the
beer
of
our
fathers
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
beats
the
coors
lights
and
buds
hands
down
this
has
a
golden
color
with
decent
head
and
fairly
good
retention
the
nose
is
slightly
malty
and
a
hint
of
hops
there
is
a
reasonable
malt
taste
and
little
taste
of
adjuncts
theyre
there
but
not
overwhelming
not
a
great
beer
barely
a
good
beer
but
not
too
bad
at
the
local
hick
bar
ill
take
this
over
the
usual
swill
legend
has
it
one
of
my
uncles
used
to
kick
back
a
30pack
of
this
every
night
one
of
the
freshest
and
most
flavorfull
beers
i
ever
had
was
one
in
the
brewery
bar
in
st
paul
in
the
midtolate
80s
picked
up
a
15pack
for
kicks
the
other
day
and
thought
id
drop
in
a
review
this
has
a
bit
more
taste
than
most
macros
but
it
has
a
bite
to
it
as
well
that
most
macro
beer
drinkers
dont
care
for
if
you
try
real
hard
you
can
get
a
tich
of
a
caramel
flavor
not
sure
what
the
firebrewing
does
or
even
if
they
do
it
anymore
now
that
pabst
brews
it
overall
its
a
nice
changeup
for
the
every
day
american
lagers
available
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
121401
when
this
beer
was
made
in
detroit
it
was
handsdown
better
than
other
u
s
macros
when
production
shifted
out
of
state
the
taste
suffered
pabst
has
done
a
decent
job
of
reviving
it
in
recent
years
but
it
is
still
a
notch
below
what
it
was
years
ago
i
still
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
but
it
isnt
as
widely
available
as
it
used
to
be
good
old
detroit
strohs
was
a
very
good
american
lager
somehow
this
stuff
showed
up
at
the
hotel
bar
of
the
hyatt
in
new
delhi
of
all
places
while
i
was
there
awhile
back
i
thought
wow
i
cant
really
think
of
many
beers
which
wouldve
been
a
poorer
representation
of
american
beer
i
chose
the
indian
beer
this
stuff
is
a
quarter
notch
above
the
typical
mass
produced
swill
this
is
the
lake
beer
of
choice
moderate
body
with
a
bit
of
hops
a
surprise
in
a
macro
finish
is
clean
without
astringency
no
overwhelming
corn
or
rice
notes
again
a
surpise
in
a
macro
one
of
the
better
mega
beers
best
ice
cold
from
the
cooler
i
cant
be
too
hard
on
pbr
for
the
price
its
the
best
cheap
beer
out
there
and
definitely
the
beer
of
choice
if
i
just
want
to
get
drunk
with
friends
definitely
outcompetes
nattie
light
busch
light
and
all
that
other
stuff
i
like
it
as
a
session
beer
its
not
something
to
sit
there
and
appreciate
just
drink
it
as
a
good
friend
of
mine
said
it
goes
great
with
punk
rock
shows
and
smoking
cigarettes
i
wanted
something
cheap
and
drinkable
steel
reserve
need
not
apply
and
this
was
the
best
the
gas
station
had
to
offer
i
should
have
spent
the
exorbitant
mark
up
and
got
something
else
6
tall
boys
were
5
too
many
light
and
crisp
american
macrobrewery
lager
smells
faintly
of
apples
theres
a
time
and
a
place
for
this
beer
itll
get
ya
drunk
wont
taste
good
until
about
9
will
only
drink
it
if
its
free
i
would
never
pay
to
drink
this
beer
it
better
be
free
its
like
budweiser
but
a
little
better
never
understood
its
popularity
other
than
being
dirt
cheap
bad
beer
should
be
cheap
served
in
a
pint
glass
o
not
bad
for
what
it
is
picked
it
up
from
a
gas
station
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
on
the
way
back
from
fishing
in
the
gulf
so
something
has
to
be
said
for
availability
i
would
take
this
over
some
of
the
other
macros
for
sure
overall
fresh
but
bland
and
overly
accessible
too
bitter
for
a
lager
in
my
taste
this
is
the
best
cheap
adjunct
lager
pours
a
surprisingly
thick
and
creamy
head
and
while
it
is
watery
it
still
has
a
nice
creamed
corn
taste
the
only
real
complaint
i
have
is
the
inconsistent
feel
ive
had
this
beer
many
many
times
and
sometimes
its
incredibly
smooth
but
it
often
has
a
stinging
carbonation
still
an
excellent
beer
for
what
it
costs
overall
people
who
seek
cheap
beer
should
try
pabst
blue
ribbon
pbr
just
not
a
very
good
beer
imo
a
pretty
decent
beer
considering
how
cheap
it
is
i
can
down
one
after
the
other
of
pbr
just
a
runofthemill
lager
brew
that
is
a
good
fillercleanser
between
craft
brews
give
it
a
4
on
feel
purely
because
of
the
costquality
affect
of
having
fun
with
beer
nothing
overpowering
in
this
beer
but
clean
love
that
it
comes
in
pint
cans
to
wet
the
whistle
after
a
long
day
in
the
yard
at
the
lake
or
coming
off
the
slopes
serving
on
tap
at
a
st
patrick
day
probably
need
to
try
it
again
the
greatest
beer
at
this
price
point
best
macrobeer
in
my
opinion
great
for
long
nights
of
drinking
borderline
undrinkable
temperature
must
be
ice
cold
to
avoid
vomiting
best
beer
for
your
money
smooth
drinking
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
more
taste
than
most
american
style
lagers
aside
from
it
being
popular
now
and
i
see
no
way
how
this
beer
justifies
a
2
93
rating
it
tastes
as
though
it
is
made
with
spent
grain
icky
you
know
its
just
the
same
shit
not
good
just
cheap
mild
malt
aroma
and
taste
a
bit
better
than
a
typical
macro
lager
not
a
beer
worth
over
analyzing
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
cheap
and
drinkable
almost
anytime
enjoy
pretty
much
the
only
time
youre
going
to
enjoy
one
of
these
is
at
the
end
of
the
night
when
youve
already
had
too
much
to
drink
i
read
somewhere
that
every
time
a
pbr
is
drank
a
hipster
gets
his
vintage
bicycle
why
have
i
waited
so
long
to
review
this
gem
i
know
its
one
of
the
biggest
lovehate
beers
around
and
i
happen
to
be
a
lover
the
only
macro
i
purchased
regularly
in
college
a
30pack
a
week
while
buying
groceries
in
arizona
easy
to
drink
and
consistent
personally
i
think
its
best
from
a
can
rather
than
draft
and
bottle
once
upon
a
time
i
was
totally
okay
quaffing
these
down
like
water
at
parties
now
i
am
older
and
oh
so
slightly
wiser
i
e
employed
so
i
recognize
this
as
well
shit
that
said
i
cant
help
but
find
this
beer
comforting
in
the
right
scenario
even
if
those
scenarios
are
limited
to
getting
this
for
free
or
being
the
cheapest
notbudweiser
beer
available
at
the
concert
venue
it
may
be
decidedly
lowtier
but
theres
no
doubt
theres
a
function
for
it
somewhere
in
your
life
smooth
and
perfect
for
bbq
the
gold
standard
of
its
class
it
is
just
a
good
all
around
adjunct
there
is
a
reason
the
neohipster
types
have
clung
to
this
well
theyve
moved
on
by
now
im
sure
but
thats
just
this
generations
peripatetic
and
fickle
nature
pbr
will
stand
the
test
of
time
an
ice
cold
bottle
of
this
stuff
is
sublime
at
the
right
moments
one
of
my
fav
cheap
beers
wish
it
was
more
available
in
the
uk
as
the
price
over
here
is
not
representative
of
the
quality
and
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
draught
have
tried
both
can
and
bottle
versions
and
they
are
like
regular
lagers
but
with
an
extra
sweetness
can
also
distinctively
taste
corn
or
maize
syrup
my
girlfriend
doesnt
like
beer
but
likes
this
one
im
white
trash
and
im
in
trouble
like
many
others
i
used
to
drink
this
a
lot
when
i
was
younger
i
decided
to
try
this
again
to
see
if
i
still
liked
it
i
didnt
watery
with
a
bad
aftertaste
not
the
worst
cheap
beer
out
there
i
will
finish
the
six
pack
eventually
not
a
good
beer
at
all
not
worth
drinking
if
i
had
to
i
love
this
beer
when
im
partying
my
granpa
drank
it
my
father
drank
it
and
i
got
hold
that
tradition
americana
at
its
finest
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
accept
it
for
what
it
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
a
little
harsh
taste
it
has
a
lingering
after
taste
that
is
not
too
pleasant
but
for
a
macro
brew
its
ok
more
complex
than
bud
or
coors
the
ultimate
hipster
beer
this
beer
is
also
underrated
compared
to
all
other
macros
the
only
adjunct
ill
buy
just
glad
the
russians
didnt
get
their
hands
on
this
brew
i
feel
its
our
duty
as
baers
to
promote
this
to
the
youngercheaper
set
so
that
they
avoid
lining
the
pockets
of
bmc
you
see
a
college
kid
with
a
bud
lite
dope
slap
him
and
give
him
a
pbr
its
american
dammit
decent
beer
to
drink
on
a
summer
day
good
beer
for
17
for
a
30
pack
you
cant
get
anything
better
i
love
that
this
beer
comes
in
30
packs
not
many
good
beers
come
in
30
packs
good
old
american
white
trash
redneck
beer
can
never
go
wrong
with
it
sweeter
and
perhaps
more
flavourful
than
other
aals
that
can
be
good
or
bad
sometimes
i
want
something
more
watery
just
to
chug
back
like
busch
or
something
either
way
ill
play
the
hipster
game
when
i
want
to
pbr
is
the
white
trash
chic
trend
beer
today
i
have
always
liked
it
it
has
a
great
hop
flavor
and
is
very
smooth
i
will
never
understand
why
anyone
likes
this
beer
tastes
like
dirty
water
and
the
after
taste
is
even
worse
if
its
110
degrees
and
your
at
the
lake
and
you
wanna
be
able
to
drink
beer
all
day
then
grab
this
i
really
cant
see
any
other
time
where
it
would
be
a
good
idea
fresh
from
jackson
pub
in
downtown
milwaukee
not
what
is
was
2o
years
ago
the
label
isnt
so
bad
pabst
is
by
far
the
most
overhyped
macro
beer
in
the
north
america
it
looks
the
same
as
almost
all
other
macros
but
the
smell
of
grain
is
really
strong
and
the
taste
is
very
bitter
unless
served
ice
cold
i
still
take
regular
bud
any
day
best
cheap
beer
out
there
its
a
lot
better
on
tap
not
a
fan
of
pbr
never
have
been
its
pbr
what
can
you
say
it
won
a
blue
ribbon
what
do
you
really
expect
pbr
is
the
best
domestic
lager
you
can
buy
and
it
is
7
99
per
12er
enough
said
food
pairings
broken
pretzel
pieces
from
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
cold
pizza
marlboro
reds
jaegermeister
i
do
not
like
this
beer
simple
crappy
beer
but
easy
to
drink
i
know
this
is
a
cheap
beer
and
for
many
years
it
was
not
even
available
around
my
parts
of
the
woods
well
guess
what
folks
its
back
i
love
this
beer
i
dont
know
why
i
just
do
and
since
posting
on
fb
pages
ive
noticed
that
some
of
my
friends
that
i
grew
up
with
in
high
school
love
it
too
doesnt
matter
if
it
comes
from
a
can
or
a
bottle
still
taste
good
i
want
to
try
this
on
tap
some
day
2
585
heineken
fuck
that
shit
pabst
blue
ribbon
what
can
i
say
about
this
one
it
was
pretty
much
as
expected
and
not
at
all
good
the
smell
in
particular
being
a
poor
one
but
it
did
manage
to
remain
at
least
partially
drinkable
just
not
all
that
enjoyable
the
taste
was
fairly
basic
and
i
could
imagine
it
appealing
to
your
macro
lager
drinkers
due
to
its
crisp
clean
taste
but
it
wasnt
a
good
beer
at
all
i
still
give
this
more
points
for
being
cheap
and
largely
available
also
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
i
dont
mind
drinking
this
pbr
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
with
similar
lightness
i
would
buy
pbr
almost
exclusively
in
college
because
i
believed
and
still
believe
that
it
was
the
best
beer
i
could
buy
for
the
price
i
could
get
a
12er
for
7
99
unfortunately
pbr
has
seen
an
increase
in
demand
resulting
in
a
higher
price
in
my
area
now
i
think
a
12er
of
sam
adams
or
new
belgium
is
a
better
deal
pbr
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
and
is
very
refreshing
always
puts
off
those
who
like
to
rid
beer
of
all
of
its
taste
it
is
a
little
skunky
but
something
about
it
tastes
great
i
recommend
getting
in
cans
as
the
bottles
seem
to
add
some
offputting
skunkiness
great
adjunct
lager
lite
body
crisp
refreshing
for
an
aal
it
does
have
a
little
more
character
than
similar
brands
not
complex
just
a
little
more
character
very
drinkable
or
a
great
session
beer
also
a
good
burger
pizza
tacos
beer
etc
compare
with
other
more
expensive
beers
and
you
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
nectar
nectar
nectar
my
dads
beer
of
choice
good
stuff
it
is
what
it
is
slightly
more
hoppy
than
budweiser
pb
argg
its
the
best
of
the
worst
and
it
tastes
pretty
good
too
as
a
semi
broke
college
kid
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
night
of
heavy
and
excessive
drinking
or
when
watching
the
game
at
a
relaxed
restaurant
other
than
that
this
beer
is
just
okay
it
has
a
very
mild
taste
with
no
distinguishable
hops
and
it
goes
down
smoothly
it
is
best
to
drink
pbr
while
laying
in
the
darkest
corner
of
a
subway
stop
dont
knock
it
till
you
try
it
then
go
ahead
and
knock
it
its
cheap
so
it
tastes
cheap
good
for
a
day
on
the
lake
around
the
4th
of
july
personally
i
found
it
weird
when
my
friends
said
that
they
wanted
to
funnel
beer
into
their
butts
but
as
a
huge
howard
stern
fan
i
thought
if
richard
christie
can
identify
beer
through
his
ass
how
hard
can
it
be
so
i
depants
my
boy
dave
held
my
legs
behind
my
head
as
i
lay
on
my
back
and
my
other
buddy
handsome
mike
did
the
pouring
just
a
little
sip
at
first
as
i
didnt
want
to
get
too
giggly
all
i
can
say
is
yum

this
is
the
most
enjoyable
way
to
do
it
overall
i
really
dont
mind
a
pbr
at
all
especially
and
ice
cold
one
on
a
hot
arizona
summer
afternoon
i
find
the
best
way
to
enjoy
this
beer
is
can
poured
into
a
glass
the
appearance
is
a
little
nicer
than
most
american
style
lagers
smell
is
a
little
grassy
but
its
not
bad
at
all
its
really
kind
of
pleasant
and
refreshing
scent
not
as
skunky
as
most
in
its
class
the
taste
is
very
surprising
with
it
being
very
crisp
you
can
pick
up
some
grain
but
not
overpowering
very
drinkable
and
no
horrible
after
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
better
than
typical
without
the
carbonation
ruining
your
taste
buds
for
the
duration
of
the
session
i
think
its
the
best
in
its
class
definitely
very
drinkable
i
liked
it
the
pbr
pours
like
a
kellerweizen
piss
yellow
with
a
nice
fluffy
eggshell
white
head
though
that
skims
down
to
a
quarter
of
a
fingers
width
quite
quickly
the
beers
body
is
water
clear
with
a
torrent
of
bubbles
working
to
the
top
of
the
glass
in
truth
the
beer
looks
a
little
like
ginger
ale
in
the
glass
the
beers
head
leaves
a
lacing
of
medium
sized
and
tightly
packed
bubbles
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
sparse
scraggly
lines
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
weakly
of
sweet
grassy
malts
with
a
touch
of
caramel
that
stale
grain
smell
that
is
found
in
most
cheap
lagers
is
also
present
here
it
actually
smells
better
than
some
of
the
other
cheap
lagers
ive
reviewed
its
not
amazing
but
it
doesnt
turn
my
stomach
either
and
it
doesnt
have
a
completely
bland
character
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweetly
bready
with
a
touch
of
acid
and
the
faintest
touch
of
salt
the
beers
flavors
begin
with
water
slowly
opening
into
stale
bread
and
grassy
hops
that
turn
haylike
the
finish
is
clean
and
quick
giving
that
slightly
vegetal
chemical
sweet
taste
that
all
cheap
lagers
have
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
thin
with
a
medium
light
carbonation
that
does
fluff
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
wet
after
the
beer
passes
this
beer
is
supremely
drinkable
which
is
why
it
still
exists
today
it
also
leaves
the
mouth
in
flavor
soon
after
it
travels
down
your
throat
overall
this
is
pbr
it
is
cheap
beer
but
it
is
not
offensive
its
just
pretty
flavorless
to
pbrs
credit
i
find
more
flavor
in
it
than
in
other
comparable
cheap
lagers
that
ive
reviewed
i
e
red
stripe
buy
a
thirty
if
you
want
to
cheaply
drink
yourself
stupid
it
is
not
the
worst
thing
you
could
drink
overalltastes
good
with
spicy
and
salty
food
and
it
needs
to
be
very
cold
to
taste
okay
very
average
i
only
buy
it
when
i
feel
like
being
cheap
a
true
american
crud
beer
drinkable
yes
a
tall
can
of
pbr
is
the
true
champagne
of
beers
overall
i
thought
pabst
blue
ribbon
pbr
was
an
ok
beer
the
taste
wasnt
as
good
as
i
expected
but
it
was
still
not
a
terrible
beer
the
appearance
of
the
beer
was
nice
but
the
smell
was
not
that
good
if
i
was
offered
this
beer
sometime
in
the
future
again
i
would
have
one
but
i
would
not
buy
it
the
best
american
lager
out
there
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
its
competitors
not
as
watery
more
of
a
bite
and
a
refreshing
malty
finish
pbr
me
asap
if
you
like
classic
beer
you
need
not
look
further
pbr
will
do
the
trick
cool
brand
aesthetics
also
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
its
definatley
up
there
o
this
is
an
adjunct
lager
but
compared
to
the
others
in
its
class
i
think
its
the
best
more
flavor
and
drinkability
sometimes
a
light
lager
is
needed
if
thats
the
case
id
choose
pbr
over
the
big
three
any
day
recommended
by
a
college
student
and
a
patriot
its
also
fairly
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
shotgunned
from
a
16
ounce
tallboy
appearance
is
lacking
due
to
method
of
consumption
a
light
egg
shell
off
white
head
builds
in
my
mouth
runs
down
my
shirt
and
all
over
my
face
lingering
on
my
beard
very
pleasing
aroma
contains
hints
of
aluminum
tap
water
and
sugar
also
vomit
and
pizza
but
that
may
be
due
to
the
setting
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
frigid
all
around
very
hard
to
swallow
due
to
sheer
volume
and
flowing
pressure
the
taste
is
surprisingly
non
existent
hints
of
light
caramel
malt
are
muted
by
the
loud
chanting
of
chug
in
a
vicious
circle
around
me
the
palate
is
frozen
the
belly
is
full
overall
a
solid
lager
i
will
enjoy
another
in
a
few
seconds
unlike
the
tasters
before
me
i
wake
up
and
i
want
a
pbr
fullbodied
gross
and
cheap
however
pbr
delivers
it
is
a
true
lager
just
as
much
as
a
samuel
adams
darker
fizzy
and
just
allamerican
im
glad
its
a
hipster
beer
im
glad
its
its
on
the
same
level
as
budlight
but
quite
not
i
drank
a
hamms
as
cheap
as
a
hamms
is
its
great
it
s
just
like
pbr
survived
most
of
contemporary
american
history
its
supremely
average
and
weirdly
watery
its
not
a
stout
its
not
a
pilsner
its
not
a
porter
its
an
americanstyled
lager
whatever
that
may
be
pbr
reminds
me
of
the
4th
of
july
it
reminds
me
of
senior
year
it
reminds
me
of
an
alternative
crowd
its
reminds
me
of
every
beer
game
i
ever
played
ill
stay
loyal
pbr
as
a
case
and
nothing
else
this
is
a
beer
that
i
gladly
drink
and
enjoy
on
occasion
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
crave
it
poured
from
the
can
it
has
a
light
sunny
yellow
color
and
a
thick
but
light
whippedcreamlike
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
light
dry
sweetness
underneath
but
it
is
predominated
by
a
dull
mustiness
that
is
expected
but
doesnt
veer
towards
unpleasant
like
many
in
the
style
the
mild
cereal
sweetness
is
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
and
melds
with
a
wheatlike
almost
lemony
tanginess
unfortunately
the
fine
prickly
carbonation
in
this
beer
is
often
my
least
favorite
part
of
american
lagers
of
this
style
overall
though
it
has
more
and
better
flavor
than
the
massproduced
light
lagers
making
it
a
fine
option
to
have
for
nights
when
you
just
want
a
lighttasting
beer
bready
slightly
sweet
lots
of
grain
in
the
flavor
a
bit
of
lemony
hop
bitterness
on
the
tail
end
of
the
swallow
very
drinkable
when
served
very
cold
it
goes
great
with
pizza
wings
mexican
food
etc
also
pretty
refreshing
as
a
relaxing
beer
after
a
day
of
labor
no
bells
and
whistles
but
definitely
solid
for
the
pricepoint
5
50

pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a

tint
a

and
a
half
of

with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
malt
cereal
light
malt
light
mineral
and
a
hint
of
skunk
odd
from
a
brown
bottled
beer
pleasant
flavor
of
biscuit
malt
sweet
wheat
and
light
finishing
hops
no
evidence
of
mineral
or
skunk
from
the
aroma
flavor
is
light
to
moderate
and
well
balanced
for
its
style
light
bodied
as
expected
a
pleasant
surprise
for
an
adjunct
lager
if
im
ever
trapped
in
nocraftbeer
purgatory
i
will
pick
this
up
more
malt
flavor
than
some
examples
of
the
style
but
the
tang
is
offputting
one
of
the
shittiest
beers
out
there
i
cant
stand
the
after
taste
that
after
taste
you
get
just
ruins
it
for
me
all
you
get
is
corn
and
metallic
taste
never
buying
this
corn
cooler
again
i
would
much
perefer
a
budweiser
or
busch
to
this
at
least
your
not
geting
that
terrable
after
taste
this
is
a
great
beer
classic
american
brew
people
would
laugh
when
i
would
buy
this
but
when
when
they
tasted
it
they
quit
laughing
lol
ive
only
had
this
in
cans
for
some
reason
her
in
my
lil
corner
of
texas
they
do
not
sell
it
in
bottles
hell
sometimes
im
lucky
if
i
can
find
it
at
all
for
a
while
i
had
to
go
to
san
antonio
to
find
it
even
there
it
was
only
in
cans
ugh
such
a
great
beer
should
be
on
every
shelf
just
as
bud
and
bud
light
not
very
impressed
but
i
suppose
compared
to
other
american
adjunct
lagers
pbr
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
considering
the
style
this
may
be
the
best
in
fact
i
was
quite
surprised
i
enjoyed
this
as
much
as
i
did
its
been
awhile
since
i
had
one
while
im
still
partial
to
the
tall
boy
in
a
bag
the
12oz
can
has
some
staying
power
as
well
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
no
offensive
flavors
its
noting
special
but
pretty
good
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
o
the
best
american
adjunct
lager
i
have
ever
had
refreshing
and
tasty
i
have
had
this
straight
from
the
can
but
would
urge
you
pour
this
in
a
proper
glass
it
will
open
up
a
lot
24oz
can
at
the
wintersun
concert
at
house
of
blues
la
on
11292012
i
paid
10
for
this
drinking
it
out
of
the
can
so
who
knows
what
color
it
is
smells
like
rice
corn
and
pils
malt
a
little
metal
taste
is
inoffensive
sweet
and
corny
adjunct
lager
with
grainy
notes
tame
bitterness
not
terrible
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
paying
10
for
24oz
this
is
difficult
for
me
to
rate
to
style
its
spot
on
but
its
a
wretched
style
most
known
in
america
today
as
the
hipsters
brand
not
really
but
its
something
nice
and
easy
to
drink
when
you
just
want
something
to
drink

overall
not

by

find

better
than

54this
is
not
in
the
running
to
claim
the
title
of
best
in
the
world
but
can
compete
for
best
mass
produced
and
it
has
earned
reserved
shelf
space
in
my
fridge
crisp
pale
grainy
malty
lager
easy
to
drink
and
kinda
refreshing
too
a
very
good
lager
especially
for
the
price
that
it
is
sold
m
standard
adju
o
i
drink
this
once
in
a
while
because
its
cheap
and
not
bmc
reviewed
from
notes
enjoyed
many
many
times
over
the
years
and
formally
reviewed
here
for
the
first
time
as
it
is
my
king
of
the
cheapys
imo
and
ive
been
going
back
and
reviewing
some
of
my
favorite
old
man
brews
of
yore
that
ive
put
off
while
reviewing
craft
and
import
beers
poured
from
12oz
can
into
pilsner
glass
for
the
purposes
of
this
formal
review
for
an
informal
brew
pale
straw
yellow
color
pours
a
fluffy
head
of
about
and
inch
or
so
if
you
let
it
and
you
enjoy
that
sort
of
thing
usual
suspects
smell
wise
for
an
american
adjunct
lager
corn
mostly
and
mild
sourness
of
yeast
and
bread
taste
is
sweeter
then
most
and
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
though
their
is
that
bit
of
aal
funk
to
it
as
well
an
obvious
choice
for
a
session
beer
good
and
cheap
no
matter
if
its
can
bottle
or
draft
and
imo
creates
a
better
buzz
then
high
life
over
the
course
of
a
sessionnight
out
this
was
the
standard
american
adjunct
lager
i
came
to
enjoy
over
the
usual
bmc
stuff
thanks
to
dive
bars
rock
clubs
and
using
it
as
the
main
ingredient
in
flaming
dr
pepper
shots
at
parties
and
not
wanting
to
throw
away
the
rest
of
the
can
when
no
one
else
would
volunteer
to
finish
the
remains
not
used
in
the
shot
also
great
for
making
up
beer
bread
and
beer
can
chicken
i
prefer
the
can
to
the
bottle
or
the
draft
both
of
which
seem
a
bit
more
watery
and
rather
tasteless
where
the
can
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
and
the
metallic
taste
imo
adds
something
as
crazy
as
that
sounds
snobs
and
hipsters
be
damned
i
enjoy
this
blue
ribbon
devil
of
cheapness
of
all
the
adjunct
lagers
this
one
probably
comes
closest
to
actually
duplicating
a
pilsner
the
beer
as
most
everyone
knows
is
a
golden
yellow
like
most
macros
and
has
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
leaving
some
lacing
and
little
retention
i
could
hardly
get
any
smell
from
this
beer
so
not
much
to
be
impressed
with
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
corn
and
sweet
malts
and
later
get
some
hops
that
nicely
balance
the
malts
out
a
very
smooth
crisp
and
clean
finish
that
makes
this
one
of
the
very
few
aal
beers
that
is
tasty
and
is
also
satisfying
at
the
same
time
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
low
on
money
and
in
need
of
one
o
not
bad
but
far
from
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
would
do
a
good
job
of
cooling
you
off
however
as
a
beer
it
is
largely
simple
and
uninteresting
most
of
your
adjunct
lagers
are
pretty
much
the
same
there
is
little
difference
in
smell
taste
mouthfeel
that
said
as
far
as
appearance
smell
and
mouthfeel
it
falls
in
at
average
where
i
think
its
a
little
better
is
taste
which
to
me
is
most
important
and
drink
ability
a
nice
clear
light
golden
color
average
adjunct
smell
sweet
corn
malt
taste
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
crisp
carbonation
add
to
that
a
abv
of
4
74
i
think
adds
to
the
overall
drink
ability
o
im
rather
disappointed
dont
get
me
wrong
i
wasnt
hoping
for
craft
brew
quality
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
decent
beer
pbr
is
barely
above
budweiser
as
far
a
brews
go
oh
well
pretty
average
for
an
adjunct
lager
this
beer
is
just
not
good
i
bought
this
because
it
has
decent
ratings
on
this
site
but
i
hated
every
second
of
this
beer
the
appearance
and
smell
are
very
boring
a
bland
nothing
special
at
all
the
taste
is
the
worst
part
of
this
beer
imo
it
is
like
water
with
a
slight
rice
and
corn
taste
on
the
finish
the
mouthfell
is
very
carbonated
and
boring
overall
this
is
a
boring
beer
it
is
still
better
than
any
bmc
but
still
not
good
at
all
overall
i
guess
its
a
decent
lager
thats
clean
and
refreshing
this
came
in
a
twenty
four
ounce
can
large
oversized
threefinger
head
that
dwindled
to
virtually
nothing
in
a
minute
or
so
pale
yellow
virtually
see
through
the
mug
clear
though
not
with
perfect
clarity
leaves
small
number
of
small
streaks
of
lacing
smells
like
yeast
thin
watery
mouth
feel
can
see
taste
and
feel
the
carbonation
though
relatively
moderate
the
sweetness
comes
through
most
i
thought
i
could
never
enjoy
cheap
beer
again
but
this
is
not
bad
for
the
price
about
1
40
for
24
ounces
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
at
best
in
the
value
category
but
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
would
say
this
is
my
favorite
beer
in
the
cheap
beer
category
i
dont
really
expect
anyone
to
be
buying
this
beer
to
enjoy
the
flavor
its
cheap
and
its
drinkable
good
enough
heineken
fuck
heineken
pabst
blue
ribbon
havent
had
one
of
these
brews
in
a
while
but
a
buddy
handed
one
to
me
and
im
not
one
to
refuse
a
free
beer
this
was
actually
a
lot
better
than
i
had
remembered
tastes
like
grains
malts
and
rice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
carbonation
is
good
this
was
ice
cold
so
that
helped
out
for
sure
pretty
refreshing
id
probably
go
back
to
this
one
cant
beat
a
24
pack
for
12
bucks
hands
down
kills
the
other
beers
in
its
price
range
and
above
just
a
great
american
lager
grain
a
bit
of
malt
clean
and
refreshing
so
much
better
than
what
the
herd
drinks
do
yourself
a
favor
and
grab
a
blue
ribbon
the
bottle
is
just
freakin
cool
too
cheers
enough
carbonation
to
not
taste
watered
down
and
usually
surprisingly
drinkable
though
id
never
pass
up
something
from
even
the
lowest
rungs
of
microbreweries
for
this
i
was
away
on
a
beach
vacation
and
i
guess
felt
the
need
to
take
a
vacation
from
all
the
craft
beer
id
been
having
something
about
pbr
in
a
can
strikes
both
nostalgia
as
well
as
hipness
as
many
gastropubs
serve
it
with
a
shot
chaser
im
not
going
to
bother
going
through
all
the
characteristics
as
thats
kind
of
a
waste
of
time
i
just
think
that
every
once
in
a
while
its
an
interesting
change
of
pace
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
isnt
much
hey
it
looks
and
smells
like
beer
pale
straw
gold
with
a
decent
head
and
lacing
smell
is
clean
and
mildly
hoppy
with
cereal
graininess
and
light
bitter
notes
taste
has
is
much
the
same
with
light
malt
and
crisp
dry
hops
in
the
finish
clean
crisp
feel
that
while
light
and
thin
does
not
feel
watery
not
a
bad
aal
and
much
better
than
the
bmc
alternatives
for
a
can
which
comes
out
to
less
than
a
1
per
can
and
the
reputation
that
follows
a
cheap
beer
the
taste
of
this
beer
really
suprised
me
quite
a
bit
the
beer
has
a
nice
clean
taste
to
it
with
a
clear
corncrisp
to
it
and
a
little
wheat
too
and
what
was
that
i
faintly
detected
at
the
end
yes
even
had
a
very
subtle
hop
charecter
to
it
the
beer
is
very
carbonated
as
can
be
expected
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
even
someone
as
choosy
as
me
would
go
out
and
buy
a
nice
drinkable
summer
beer
a
really
pleasant
suprise
for
how
much
it
costs
if
you
are
on
a
budget
and
looking
for
a
beer
on
a
dime
or
even
not
check
out
pbr
thought
id
give
the
old
standard
a
formal
review
pabst
and
i
go
way
back
poured
from
a
pint
can
into
my
trusty
nonic
nice
white
frothy
two
finger
head
held
on
for
a
bit
but
didnt
leave
much
lacing
nice
pretty
straw
color
the
smell
was
mostly
grain
and
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
nothing
special
more
taste
than
miller
or
bud
in
my
opinion
a
nice
cereal
type
grain
taste
and
slightly
sweet
malt
followed
by
a
subtle
but
present
hop
finish
nicely
carbonated
and
refreshing
if
i
need
a
case
of
cans
for
camping
fishing
or
a
bbq
ill
definitely
go
pabst
o
you
get
what
you
pay
for
at
8
9912
pack
in
nyc
thats
a
steal
and
something
id
still
take
over
a
lot
of
things
overall
not
too
shabby
for
a
macro
but
still
pretty
macro
tasting
od
whats
there
to
say
stick
to
the
cans
its
a
different
beer
in
a
bottle
worse
poured
a
can
of
hipsters
delight
into
my
pilsner
glass
rather
aggressive
pour
yields
a
finger
and
a
half
of
champagney
head
straw
pale
gold
body
head
dies
quickly
leaving
a
thin
layer
at
the
top
lots
of
bubbles
much
more
pilsnerlike
on
the
nose
than
budweiser
or
coors
nice
grassiness
some
biscuit
corn
some
light
generic
hoppiness
tastes
light
grainy
a
little
bit
of
honey
and
corn
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
super
bubbly
but
on
the
creamier
side
of
an
adjunct
reviewing
for
style
its
hard
to
beat
the
best
adjunct
in
usa
today
beats
anything
from
bmc
i
am
from
the
north
so
i
might
be
biased
pours
a
nice
pale
yellow
with
a
little
sticking
to
the
glass
i
enjoy
the
carbonation
keeps
it
easy
to
drink
i
like
it
in
cans
its
easier
to
transport
with
a
beer
like
this
its
great
when
you
want
to
take
some
brews
along
and
you
dont
have
a
lot
of
cash
i
with
more
brewers
would
put
more
of
the
basic
four
ingredients
and
hold
back
more
of
the
adjuncts
like
pabst
brewing
does
pbr
is
cheap
its
intended
for
hipsters
but
i
will
order
this
all
day
long
i
would
prefer
this
over
any
other
domestic
beer
you
throw
at
me
well
done
for
such
a
cheap
crappy
beer
i
say
crappy
in
the
nicest
way
possible
and
from
the
reputation
that
this
beer
has
been
given
over
the
years
bottoms
up
people
minor
guilt
pangs
as
im
a
rochester
resident
and
somewhat
loyal
genny
drinker
but
how
do
you
keep
them
down
on
the
farm
after
theyve
seen
paree
so
compared
to
other
bad
adjunct
lagers
its
decent
smooth
taste
with
no
nasty
sticky
feeling
and
not
overcarbonated
smell
is
a
little
nasty
though
of
cheap
dry
grains
avoid
at
all
costs
light
and
clean
with
just
enough
hop
flavor
to
give
it
more
character
than
the
competition
light
on
malt
sweetness
and
when
cold
adjunct
dms
flavors
are
almost
nonexistent
cult
following
is
justified
especially
on
a
hot
day
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
one
of
those
that
is
as
good
out
of
the
can
as
on
tap
enjoy
poured
from
the
can
into
my
new
williamsburg
alewerks
pint
clear
golden
and
fizzy
with
one
half
inch
quickly
disappearing
foamy
head
smell
was
of
light
grains
taste
was
upscale
adjunct
lager
drinkability
was
easy
good
for
what
it
is
a
union
made
macro
lager
finally
had
one
of
these
sure
it
is
better
than
a
bud
it
has
average
head
retention
for
its
style
nothing
distinctive
in
the
color
or
smell
go
figure
but
its
crisp
and
you
can
actually
taste
some
hops
nice
malt
character
almost
robust
even
i
had
one
on
a
hot
day
so
that
must
account
for
my
impression
of
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
clean
thirst
quencher
and
a
good
american
brew
drink
this
cold
not
because
of
hiding
the
taste
but
when
it
warms
it
loses
some
of
that
bite
which
makes
the
entire
beer
in
my
opinion
at
7
99
a
12
pack
its
a
definite
solid
cheap
beer
though
this
is
a
good
lessexpensive
alternative
to
fullpriced
american
lagers
if
a
bottle
pint
or
can
is
2
or
less
at
a
dive
bar
i
will
usually
drink
one
or
two
overall
very
drinkable
beer
ill
drink
this
when
low
on
cash
or
just
outside
or
anytime
i
just
feel
like
drinking
ive
had
more
cans
of
this
than
i
am
often
willing
to
admit
its
certainly
not
a
great
beer
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
considering
how
ridiculously
cheap
it
is
its
worth
having
once
in
a
while
its
certainly
better
than
the
heavy
bmc
beers
d
not
quite
as
bad
as
i
remember
it
being
out
of
a
can
but
still
rather
unpleasant
i
guess
if
i
had
to
pick
up
a
12pack
of
something
to
drink
in
one
night
this
might
not
be
last
on
my
list
i
like
to
orderpurchase
pbr
somewhat
as
a
joke
but
i
truly
do
enjoy
it
a
little
i
often
get
it
when
i
see
it
on
tap
because
it
is
the
cheapest
in
the
house
it
goes
down
fairly
easily
and
isnt
as
wattery
tasting
as
most
value
brands
theres
something
about
the
can
that
just
makes
me
feel
good
when
im
holding
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
still
this
beer
is
drinkable
at
any
time
of
the
year
well
lets
be
honest
here
it
seems
that
pbr
always
gets
a
leg
up
over
all
the
bmc
products
i
would
definately
take
this
over
a
bud
any
day
appearance
is
pale
yellow
clear
with
a
small
frothy
head
that
dies
quickly
after
an
aggressive
pour
smell
is
light
buscuit
malt
some
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
a
tiny
wiff
of
hops
taste
is
similar
not
much
to
talk
about
a
buiscut
malt
with
a
tight
carbonation
that
brings
the
small
amount
of
hops
out
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
slick
but
not
watery
due
to
the
high
carbonation
that
affronts
it
with
some
fullness
overall
this
is
my
go
to
super
light
lager
i
can
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
and
dammit
that
is
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
with
beer
this
pours
a
clear
pale
piss
colored
straw
of
yellow
forms
a
big
bubbly
2
finger
head
that
turns
to
a
small
lace
around
the
glass
smells
of
sweet
boiled
corn
wet
hay
maybe
some
olives
i
could
be
reaching
the
way
an
aal
should
tastes
like
corn
water
sweet
sugary
a
tad
lemon
bitter
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
hmm
well
its
not
bad
its
like
all
beers
of
its
style
light
easy
to
gulp
up
however
pbr
doesnt
not
become
offensive
to
me
as
it
warms
up
as
is
with
most
macro
aals
overall
its
ok
its
cheap
and
it
taste
like
the
way
you
remembered
beer
to
taste
which
is
why
you
dont
buy
it
anymore
overall
this
beer
is
not
anything
too
special
but
at
the
same
time
it
does
stand
out
from
most
other
lagers
of
the
style
i
would
certainly
recommend
giving
it
a
try
overall
if
it
werent
for
the
fart
smell
this
wouldnt
be
half
bad
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
cheap
without
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
its
not
a
bad
way
to
go
hard
to
beat
the
price
too
an
amazing
beer
to
be
certain
nice
levels
of
carbonation
no
head
clean
refreshing
taste
best
served
ice
cold
it
won
a
blue
ribbon
you
know
dont
drink
it
warm
it
will
be
extra
nasty
also
they
put
a
best
buy
date
underneath
the
can
so
check
for
that
if
you
are
able
to
drinkability
i
like
pbr
but
it
is
what
it
is
an
adjunct
there
is
nothing
really
special
about
it
it
is
just
another
mass
produced
cost
efficient
american
lager
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
ones
well
its
not
super
impressive
but
for
the
style
its
acceptable
and
cheep
dont
forget
cheep
when
it
comes
to
domestics
massmarket
and
cheap
beers
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
bunch
higher
in
alcohol
content
and
beer
flavor
than
the
comparable
beers
pbr
is
a
great
go
to
session
beer
that
wont
even
remotely
break
the
bank
the
only
downside
is
that
hipsters
have
recently
discovered
the
beer
and
claimed
it
as
their
own
o
for
the
style
of
adjunct
lager
pbr
is
a
bar
setter
not
a
perfect
beer
but
for
something
that
isnt
all
malt
you
dont
notice
it
and
there
is
some
decent
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
recommend
this
for
sure
and
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
great
price
for
a
sixer
and
great
beer
for
the
style
a
college
staple
and
a
long
running
favorite
of
mine
when
drinking
meant
needing
plenty
of
beers
to
slam
in
a
night
it
sets
itself
apart
from
most
in
that
style
a
good
case
of
pbr
is
great
and
rough
when
bad
that
means
hit
or
miss
for
this
cheap
adjunct
i
like
to
drink
my
beer
from
a
glass
whether
it
comes
in
a
can
or
a
bottle
but
there
is
something
about
a
bottle
of
pbr
with
the
red
white
and
blue
and
the
no
bs
nature
of
what
is
inside
that
is
akin
to
a
p51
mustang
or
a
stratocaster
or
the
chrysler
building
that
i
can
roll
with
it
anyone
who
gives
this
beer
less
than
at
least
a
b
should
have
his
or
her
citizenship
revoked
before
being
told
to
go
f
himself
i
think
i
see
why
this
stuff
is
so
highly
recommended
its
actually
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
i
dont
think
im
hip
enough
to
go
out
and
buy
a
mac
or
wear
aviators
without
looking
like
a
turd
but
if
someone
hands
me
a
pbr
in
the
future
ill
happily
drink
it
within
the
style
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
something
of
comparable
quality
and
price
mouthfeel
is
a
plus
with
sharp
carbonation
that
really
digs
its
spurs
into
your
tounge
light
body
and
so
far
the
only
real
redeeming
quality
of
this
beer
all
that
being
said
i
like
the
flavor
of
pbr
and
find
it
useful
on
hot
dry
summer
days
to
quench
a
thirst
for
a
brew
not
my
first
pick
but
not
a
bad
one
to
have
a
full
cooler
of
by
the
lake
overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
drink
12
of
them
and
you
wont
have
a
headache
the
next
day
you
will
actually
feel
good
o
a
very
nice
american
style
brew
the
color
is
a
light
golden
yellow
light
head
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
flow
upward
this
has
a
light
mouth
feel
the
taste
is
good
some
grain
very
slight
bitterness
malty
sweetness
a
little
dry
better
than
something
like
a
bud
or
coors
overall
a
good
drinking
beer
and
a
nice
change
up
although
i
cant
help
thinking
of
dennis
hopper
in
blue
velvet
every
time
i
order
this
o
a
pretty
solid
american
adjunct
lager
better
than
most
that
are
readily
available
ok
so
you
have
to
review
this
beer
for
what
it
is
and
i
discovered
that
on
the
beach
this
weekend
definitely
got
some
bonus
points
for
value
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
the
aroma
has
bready
malt
notes
the
taste
is
the
typical
clean
breadymalty
lager
but
actually
has
some
substance
and
balance
unlike
the
other
cheap
alternatives
the
mouthfeel
is
like
your
typical
lager
bubbly
and
somewhat
dry
overall
if
youre
going
to
drink
a
cheap
beer
this
should
be
it
i
usually
hate
them
but
in
particular
circumstances
such
as
on
a
hot
day
on
the
beach
going
swimming
and
playing
football
this
definitely
hit
the
spot
and
was
the
perfect
beer
for
the
job
i
really
was
surprised
i
liked
it
so
much
best
enjoyed
in
quantity
at
a
dive
bar
i
wish
the
hipsters
hadnt
taken
over
this
brand
with
their
selfloathing
and
woolcapwearinginsummer
tendencies
i
cant
help
it
i
really
really
like
pbr
it
blows
every
other
similarly
priced
macro
lager
pretty
far
out
of
the
water
for
taste
and
its
spectacularly
average
beeriness
is
really
tough
to
beat
when
you
want
one
of
something
reliable
on
a
weeknight
i
cant
in
good
conscience
call
it
underrated
but
if
i
only
had
one
beer
to
drink
in
all
seasons
for
the
rest
of
my
life
sugar
this
is
hands
down
the
most
underrated
and
unappreciated
beer
in
american
history
in
most
places
you
can
purchase
a
30
pack
of
pabst
blue
ribbon
for
about
the
same
price
as
a
30
pack
of
keystone
light
and
not
only
does
it
taste
better
than
cheap
college
party
beers
it
tastes
much
better
than
many
of
its
fellow
american
lagers
i
personally
think
that
this
beer
blows
budweiser
out
of
the
water
and
at
about
half
the
price
im
not
sure
how
you
could
argue
that
t
again
its
not
undrinkable
it
doesnt
have
a
dirty
or
metallic
taste
it
just
has
a
taste
that
i
dont
particularly
think
is
appealing
grain
corn
and
a
hint
of
pale
malts
develops
a
bit
of
a
yeast
flavor
as
it
warms
but
remains
drinkable
verdict
while
the
hipsters
may
be
more
interested
in
the
can
design
than
the
beer
inside
pbr
is
actually
not
too
terrible
of
a
beer
i
suppose
the
highest
compliment
i
could
pay
this
beer
is
that
i
could
easily
believe
this
was
a
poor
attempt
at
an
easydrinking
lager
from
a
mediocre
craft
brewery
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
thin
and
watery
it
finishes
dry
crisp
refreshing
and
not
filling
o
better
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
overall
a
good
step
up
from
bmc
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
out
there
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
fizzy
layer
of
bubbles
weak
aroma
of
corn
and
grains
memories
of
pitchers
and
cheap
dates
tastes
the
same
corn
grains
watered
down
grass
juice
with
the
possibility
of
a
hop
sneaking
in
light
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
eeeeaaasssyyyy
and
ends
with
regret
but
a
stillfull
wallet
should
be
avoided
unless
absolutely
necessary
andor
youre
broke
overall
this
is
exactly
what
i
picture
an
adjunct
lager
to
be
the
biggest
bonus
for
me
is
that
the
carbonation
is
manageable
making
this
actually
drinkable
as
opposed
to
extremely
gasinducing
beyond
that
its
pretty
bland
but
not
bad
o
it
may
be
my
milwaukee
roots
but
when
it
comes
to
drinking
macro
brews
which
i
generally
avoid
i
do
prefer
pbr
served
in
my
garage
into
a
plastic
cup
smells
like
the
good
ol
us
of
a
corn
malt
with
something
sweet
looks
like
nothing
special
and
tastes
the
same
too
but
these
puppies
all
but
drink
themselves
make
sure
you
mow
the
lawn
with
a
push
mower
or
a
zero
turn
or
you
will
be
a
sixer
deep
quick
great
american
beer
should
be
kept
in
the
back
yard
next
to
the
horseshoe
pits
it
is
the
moped
of
beers
fun
to
drink
just
dont
let
your
friends
catch
you
with
one
overall
not
a
bad
offering
for
the
style
overall
great
frat
beer
or
maybe
one
to
be
used
for
a
beer
bong
or
a
chugging
contest
not
for
me
edit
no
longer
true
since
ive
found
narragansett
lager
pabst
has
made
a
come
back
in
main
stream
taverns
here
in
chicago
so
i
went
throwback
and
tried
it
again
for
the
first
time
the
color
is
golden
clear
with
decent
carbonation
the
smell
and
taste
are
grainy
the
mouthfeel
is
simple
which
makes
it
perfect
for
after
lawn
mowing
type
activities
served
cold
this
stuff
is
actually
pretty
refreshing
flavors
are
not
very
complex
but
it
has
a
clean
simplicity
which
makes
it
tasty
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
i
dont
usually
drink
a
lot
of
pbr
but
my
landlord
offered
me
a
beer
so
im
reveiwing
it
this
certainly
isnt
the
first
macro
i
reach
for
but
its
one
of
the
better
session
aals
out
there
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
adjunct
you
could
certainly
do
a
hell
of
a
lot
worse
the
one
draw
back
is
the
corn
note
present
in
the
finish
more
prevalent
than
if
i
were
to
make
the
beer
for
myself
o
i
am
biased
to
this
one
so
please
dont
hate
the
review
prost
pale
color
faint
aroma
but
it
does
have
a
good
mouthfeel
and
a
passable
taste
o
decent
swill
to
pound
back
when
you
maxed
out
your
credit
card
find
some
change
inside
your
couch
and
find
the
pack
in
the
clearance
aisle
of
your
favorite
supermarket
given
the
cost
20
for
12473
ml
in
ontario
i
can
see
why
pbr
is
popular
these
days
its
a
very
typical
example
of
the
style
but
with
a
bit
more
punch
than
comparable
beers
came
out
looking
flat
id
been
drinking
out
of
the
can
24oz
mancan
before
i
decided
to
review
so
that
could
be
why
it
smells
like
most
macrobrews
a
little
corny
that
nauseating
hint
of
sweetness
is
absent
in
the
nose
light
straw
color
crystal
clear
very
drinkable
and
im
not
being
sarcastic
much
better
than
my
beast
that
i
drink
theres
a
grainy
bitterness
but
very
light
no
hint
of
sweetness
which
i
really
despise
in
american
lite
lagers
sparkling
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
purewhite
head
on
top
lightly
sweet
anemic
grainy
aroma
faint
grass
and
corn
very
bland
nearly
flavorless
beery
flavor
its
not
awful
especially
on
a
hot
day
andor
to
wash
down
certain
food
light
grainy
sweetness
decently
crisp
not
too
corny
or
anything
i
dont
know
cheap
harmless
flavorless
beery
beer
judged
as
an
american
lager
this
is
a
classic
great
beer
its
better
than
its
bigger
competitors
and
a
joy
to
drink
when
youre
looking
for
a
crisp
clean
beer
that
goes
down
well
elegantly
simple
refreshingly
uncomplicated
i
feel
cool
drinking
it
just
popped
a
can
of
this
classic
while
this
beer
is
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
is
is
probably
my
favorite
american
adjunct
lager
id
take
a
pbr
any
day
over
a
bud
miller
or
coors
its
cheep
and
doesnt
taste
awful
while
still
getting
the
job
done
on
a
weekend
night
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
as
an
alternative
beer
for
casual
beer
drinkers
id
rather
have
a
bud
or
a
coors
sorry
to
say
it
but
it
be
the
truth
overall
this
beer
isnt
half
bad
if
your
looking
at
it
in
the
cheap
beer
realm
as
a
college
student
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
to
buy
a
30
its
cheap
its
tastes
good
enough
and
most
importantly
it
gets
the
job
done
of
course
id
rather
be
drinking
something
with
a
bit
more
class
but
as
far
as
bang
for
your
buck
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
way
better
then
busch
light
or
natty
everywhere
in
philly
overall
its
an
aal
which
is
just
meh
but
its
not
the
worst
that
is
out
there
and
its
not
a
terrible
brew
to
have
around
overall
overall
this
beer
is
a
pretty
solid
generic
american
lager
in
my
opinion
i
would
pick
it
time
and
again
over
most
of
the
other
american
beer
tyrants
such
as
budweiser
coors
and
miller
overall
drinkability
crap
no
real
redeeming
qualities
besides
the
price
even
that
doesnt
balance
out
the
worthiness
of
this
brew
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
but
compared
to
most
of
the
affordable
stuff
out
there
i
think
this
is
king
its
pretty
drinkable
and
i
will
still
drink
this
beer
in
the
future
probably
for
a
while
if
you
only
have
a
buck
or
two
and
want
to
enjoy
a
beer
i
recommend
this
very
refreshing
macro
lager
better
than
i
was
anticipating
poured
a
2
head
which
took
a
while
to
dissipate
clear
and
almost
neon
yellow
color
smell
and
taste
are
standard
bmc
weak
general
american
lager
however
it
has
a
little
zing
and
the
finish
is
longer
than
the
typical
bmc
if
i
regularly
chose
bmc
styles
as
my
standard

this

pretty
drinkable
even
though
its
a
light
beer
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
cheap
in
large
quantities
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
1
and
that
was
because
when
i
tried
this
i
just
wanted
to
see
what
it
tasted
like
mistakes
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
for
the
money
if
you
enjoy
drinking
frequently
for
that
reason

its
just
off

in
taste
and
drinkability
one
of
only
a

this

in

standing

barbecue
a
place
where
you
may
need
to
keep
few
extra
in
a
private
stash
to
deal
with
the
family
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
but
is
still
refreshing
and
the
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
one
american
classic
that
im
proud
to
say
is
one
of

things

here
this

is

or

it
doesnt

to
be
any
of
those
things

if

is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
mowing
the
lawn
it
gets
the
job
done
for
refreshment
it
really
is
better
than
the
huge
macro
light
beers
not
a
bad
quencher
for
a
hot
summer
day
while
doing
yard
work
though
taste
and
smell
were
almost
nonexistent
mouthfeel
was
like
soda
water
with
a
little
beer
flavoring
i
really
hate
to
beer
bash
because
someone
probably
put
their
heart
and
soul
into
brewing
this
so
im
not
going
to
say
i
hate
it
but
it
is
difficult
i
have
noticed
a
recent
trend
for
this
beer
lately
so
i
put
it
on
tap
for
oktoberfest
i
never
heard
the
end
of
that
one
needless
to
say
college
bar
i
cant
really
distinguish
why
this
loved
particularly
more
than
any
other
macro
other
than
the
marketing
campaign
behind
it
for
me
jan
31
2010
is
it
awful
no
not
really
and
certainly
not
when
its
compared
with
the
other
big
brews
its
probably
good
at
a
ball
game
or
as
a
lawnmower
beer
is
it
good
cant
say
that
it
is
that
either
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
again
considering
the
style
of
beer
it
is
would
i
take
this
over
craft
beer
no
but
if
i
had
a
long
days
work
and
wanted
to
unwind
while
saving
some
cash
id
settle
with
pbr
much
rather
have
this
than
bud
or
coors
or
miller
this
is
by
no
means
a
sipping
beer
for
anyone
that
isnt
currently
living
in
a
trailer
but
its
not
bad
either
pbr
straight
from
the
can
with
salt
on
the
rim
what
other
way
is
there
ok
maybe
thats
a
little
southern
but
a
can
of
pbr
with
some
jackyl
blasting
is
good
times
its
an
american
classic
and
better
then
any
of
the
common
macros
out
there
very
effervescent
very
very
yellow
and
i
will
not
bash
an
american
icon
dr
if
necessary
aah
memories
it
is
a
great
beer
to
buy
for
parties
and
a
great
alternative
at
an
event
its
nice
when
you
can
be
at
a
music
venue
and
have
a
great
tasting
pbr
and
not
get
your
wallet
assaulted
i
noticed
that
a
local
beer
distributor
had
24
packs
on
sale
for
10
99
so
i
said
why
not
me
and
a
friend
did
a
powerhour
with
a
case
of
this
a
few
months
ago
and
hated
this
beer
but
this
case
i
just
previously
purchased
was
great
its
drinkability
is
very
high
and
didnt
mind
the
taste
at
all
for
this
low
price
i
may
have
to
stock
up
d
very
easy
i
dont
see
why
some
just
plan
hate
this
beer
light
pale
yellow
color
with
a
large
head
with
decent
retention
smells
of
cooked
corn
and
sweet
malt
with
some
hops
the
malt
aroma
is
not
very
strong
taste
mostly
like
corn
and
grain
with
hops
and
malt
also
present
thin
and
watery
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
not
too
bad
appearance
is
of
light
golden
color
and
crisp
head
smell
has
a
corny
adjunct
graininess
to
it
taste
of
crisp
lightly
metallic
adjunct
with
a
clean
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
having
good
body
and
carbonation
not
one
of
the
smoothest
lagers
ive
had
but
not
bad
poured
my
pbr
into
a
frosty
mug
it
poured
a
medium
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
it
didnt
reveal
much
nose
but
i
wasnt
expecting
much
for
a
sunday
afternoon
watching
football
with
your
friends
beer
its
perfect
i
have
not
tasted
pbr
in
quite
some
time
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
again
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
well
considering
the
metal
tap
and
mouth
opening
makes
the
brunt
of
the
taste
i
would
say
this
is
worse
than
the
bud
cans
the
feel
and
colour
and
the
drinkability
is
the
same
in
comparison
to
the
standard
nonlight
versions
of
the
macros
availability
and
price
are
great
and
your
supporting
an
american
union
labor
supporting
i
still
think
there
closed
shop
brewery
average
drinkability
not
bad
not
great
its
funny
because
at
my
store
we
get
old
dudes
coming
in
all
the
time
saying
i
cant
believe
they
still
make
pbr
same
with
schaffer
and
a
few
others
anyways
i
tried
out
pbr
and
i
must
say
for
a
very
cheap
beer
i
was
kind
of
impressed
this
beer
remains
to
be
a
staple
in
american
beer
and
continues
to
deliver
the
essence
of
american
culture
namely
the
60s80s
this
beer
has
a
light
gold
color
with
a
silky
mouthful
that
lingers
on
your
palate
well
after
consuming
a
sip
an
easy
beer
to
chug
and
an
easy
beer
to
buy
very
assessable
and
generic
pbr
is
very
drinkable
while
maybe
not
the
best
but
certainly
not
the
worst
kudos
very
nice
beer
to
have
great
session
beer
if
i
am
short
on
money
this
is
one
of
the
beers
i
think
about
all
around
average
beer
i
wont
badmouth
this
one
because
it
delivers
what
it
promises
to
be
an
unassuming
beer
for
the
masses
ive
purchased
in
the
past
and
will
purchase
again
its
an
average
beer
all
around
but
maybe
thats
why
i
like
it
so
much
cheap
easy
drinking
and
a
step
up
from
the
massmarket
lights
i
3
my
pbr
m
watery
did
not
like
much
of
anything
about
the
king
of
college
beers
pbr
other
than
the
fact
it
was
very
cheap
and
a
fairly
smooth
drink
it
was
not
a
pleasant
experience
drinking
my
first
and
only
pbr
the
appearance
was
your
standard
yellow
american
lager
but
once
poured
had
very
little
foam
and
basically
looked
like
urine
that
had
been
sitting
around
for
a
while
taste
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
to
be
honest
if
you
plan
on
getting
drunk
and
dont
want
to
pay
much
for
it
then
go
for
some
pbr
if
you
actually
want
to
enjoy
your
beer
i
would
recommend
something
else
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
macro
its
still
a
macro
to
be
sure
but
its
not
a
complete
watery
fizzy
mess
like
ive
come
to
expect
i
actually
enjoyed
this
and
you
absolutely
cant
beat
that
price
think
thisll
be
my
new
goto
macro
rjt
complex
no
however
a
clear
win
in
domestic
adjuncts

at
least
now
i
can
say
that
ive
tried
it
and
it
confirms
my
suspicions
that
people
drink
it
because
its
trendy
not
because
its
especially
good
this
is
a
very
pale
copper
yellow
color
clear
with
minor
carbonation
the
head
quickly
resolves
to
a
thin
white
ring
lacing
is
short
lived
the
aroma
is
mild
cereal
with
a
kiss
of
lemon
the
taste
is
simple
bread
and
slightly
spicey
citrus
a
little
bit
of
bite
from
the
carbonation
so
its
reasonably
refreshing
though
not
over
bubbly
certainly
very
drinkable
nothing
horribly
wrong
here
better
than
a
lot
of
easy
drinking
macro
types
which
is
the
point
afterall
kudos
for
the
cheap
and
alright
medium
to
low
body
there
is
a
strong
aftertaste
mild
sweetness
up
front
aftertaste
negatively
affects
drinkability
overall
not
as
good
as
i
remember
taste
is
enhanced
by
a
decent
yeast
strain
that
is
marginally
sweet
minimal
hop
presence
probably
something
like
east
kent
goldings
or
glacier
those
seem
to
be
always
used
when
you
cant
taste
much
hops
mouthfeel
meh
but
hey
this
stuff
is
very
drinkable
they
get
better
the
more
you
have
if
you
like
freedom
buy
some
pbr
probably
tastes
better
than
other
us
macros
ie
bud
and
coors
but
unlike
those
pbr
is
actually
made
in
the
usaalso
it
usually
is
significantly
cheaper
than
its
us
macro
competition
if
you
want
to
get
some
cheap
beer
pbr
is
a
solid
choice
get
some
its
the
beer
that
party
kids
who
actually
enjoy
beer
tend
to
buy
and
theres
no
shame
in
that
at
all
a
little
more
taste
a
little
more
depth
and
a
little
more
character
than
almost
any
of
the
other
macros
out
there
of
course
make
no
mistake
its

a
case
for
a

reason

an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
and
a
great
brew
for
the
price
much
better
than
your
typical
light
or
adjunct
lager
and
just
as
inexpensive
thisll
be
my
cheap
beer
for
a
while
to
come
wahhmasterdec

and
ive
had
30
and
have
been
ever
more
happy
perfect
for
any

and
pabst
works
out
even
for
the
beer
snob
in
the
family
stangski83nov
08
its
always
nice
and
it
usually
tastes
a
little
fresher
i
had
this
beer
at
a
little
get
together
it
was
the
first
time
in
probably
15
years
since
ive
had
a
pbr
this
is
bland
tasteless
totally
innocuous
easy
to
drink
refreshing
with
a
touch
of
malt
but
nothing
too
much
else
the
thing
that
perplexes
me
most
about
adjunct
lagers
is
that
they
are
largely
tasteless
it
is
like
parsing
the
finer
qualities
of
water
there
is
just
a
flat
palate
of
flavors
from
which
to
choose
there
is
nothing
bad
about
a
pbr
there
just
isnt
much
there
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
grainy
with
a
metallic
after
taste
good
old
pbr
if
i
have
to
choose
a
cheap
grocerystore
adjunct
this
is
the
beer
i
reach
for
it
doesnt
really
repulse
me
like
many
other
macro
adjunct
lagers
rather
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
a
typical
grainy
adjunct
taste
with
a
slightly
sweetmetallic
aftertaste
high
amounts
of
carbonation
and
a
light
body
all
in
all
a
smooth
drinker
thats
easy
to
finish
i
always
associated
pbr
as
an
old
man
beer
my
brotherinlaw
hes
not
an
old
man
had
some
at
the
house
and
since
im
no
beer
snob
i
gave
it
a
shot
it
was
surprisingly
ok
not
a
bad
beer
not
great
average
in
all
regards
for
my
money
this
is
a
good
beer
for
drinking
with
likeminded
beer
fans
while
watching
a
game
etc
no
pbr
is
not
good
beer
it
is
not
bad
beer
it
has
no
color
really
no
smell
and
the
only
distinctive
feature
of
the
taste
is
a
metallic
piquant
moderate
carbonation
and
thin
drinkability
is
fairly
good
after
all
it
was
made
to
be
consumed
easily
pbr
has
good
street
cred
generations
have
relied
upon
it
and
even
in
this
era
it
has
its
uses
on
a
given
night
when
one
is
tired
and
has
the
blues
and
faces
the
convenience
store
dilemma
of
what
kind
of
alcohol
to
imbibe
a
24
oz
pbr
and
a
bag
of
peanuts
is
more
than
enough
to
help
one
cope
this
american
lager
has
quite
a
cult
following
but
not
much
better
or
worse
than
its
peers
still
a
good
choice
for
the
price
and
a
12pack
in
my
refridgerator
helps
me
space
out
my
indulgence
into
better
beer
look
we
cant
always
drink
hand
crafted
deluxe
microbrews
some
times
we
need
to
mix
it
up
or
maybe
just
get
drunk
pbr
is
my
gettingtrashedandwatchingfootball
beer
as
far
as
cheap
beer
goes
it
tastes
alright
and
is
pretty
smooth
the
best
thing
about
pbr
is
how
much
of
it
an
average
person
can
drink
im
not
saying
that
it
is
a
weak
beer
only
that
it
flows
smoothly
goes
down
easy
and
stays
down
great
for
tailgating
and
drinking
games
if
you
arent
feeling
snobby
and
just
want
to
pound
some
brews
for
the
sake
of
doing
so
go
grab
the
blue
ribbon
not
so
bad
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
doesnt
really
distinguish
itself
from
the
crowd
but
goes
down
just
fine
ok
on
taste
alone
this
was
pretty
drinkable
at
least
if
youre
not
expecting
beer
brilliance
but
a
decent
easily
accessable
brew
i
might
even
pay
for
the
next
one
dvery
easy
drinking
although
somewhat
lacking
in
taste
beats
bmc
hands
down
as
the
ads
used
to
say
pbr
me
asap
occasionally
i
want
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
pbr
fits
the
bill
not
bad
for
a
subpremium
i
actually
prefer
it
at
times
since
it
seems
to
be
a
little
more
flavorful
than
the
bmc
products
long
live
pbr
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
drink
it
a
lot
and
if
the
choices
or
wallet
are
slim
this
is
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
not
really
but
still
better
than
other
beers
at
a
similar
price
when
you
dont
have
the
money
to
drink
good
beer
at
least
pbr
will
always
be
there
for
you
not
much
finish
or
aroma
but
a
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
ahh
what
can
you
say
about
good
ole
pbr
for
the
cheap
price
it
is
the
best
beer
you
can
get
easy
to
drink
you
can
pound
multiple
of
them
if
that
is
what
youre
feeling
or
you
can
relax
and
enjoy
a
couple
like
i
said
before
it
definately
is
the
best
cheapest
beer
out
there
try
it
out
i
feel
a
sense
of
pride
when
i
drink
this
beer
this
is
a
classic
american
lager
that
i
hold
close
to
my
heart
so
it
is
going
to
be
hard
to
say
anything
negative
about
this
beermy
cousin
and
i
used
to
sneak
this
brew
from
my
grandmothers
fridge
when
we
were
just
11
or
12
and
take
it
to
the
woods
and
drink
them
for
my
first
ever
buzz
great
beer
great
price
it
pours
an
appealing
light
gold
color
it
smells
like
sweet
corn
and
malt
it
taste
like
liquid
gold
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sub
par
but
not
enough
to
complain
the
drinkability
is
unsurpassable
but
hey
im
biased
had
this
as
a
kid
growing
up
years
ago
still
tastes
and
smells
the
same
grainy
with
little
other
aroma
or
flavor
finish
is
short
lived
and
nondescript
however
this
one
takes
me
back
to
my
factoryworking
ballplaying
running
around
days
so
i
have
to
like
it
some
d
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
more
out
of
a
can
the
appeal
of
this
went
away
after
6
oz
or
so
did
not
finish
my
pint
i
mean
ive
shotgunned
hundreds
of
these
im
sure
as
this
was
my
go
to
beer
in
highschool
so
maybe
a
hold
a
bit
of
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
this
beer
i
feel
my
rating
is
fair
considering
im
reviewing
with
the
style
in
mind
however
in
conclusion
it
is
what
it
is
for
a
totally
utilitarian
beer
you
could
do
worse
ill
have
it
as
a
last
resort
but
is
that
really
the
point
md
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
session
beer
a
good
choice
over
the
other
bmc
crap
taste
is
especially
quenching
at
first
because
there
is
not
too
much
malt
sweetness
in
the
beginning
some
mild
bitterness
slightly
floral
slightly
skunky
not
sure
how
it
could
resemble
skunk
when
it
was
in
a
can
slightly
berrylike
probably
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
just
because
it
isnt
too
sweet
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
feels
quite
nice
drinks
lighter
than
most
adjunct
lagers
and
not
as
sweet
d
again
this
is
made
for
mass
consumption
and
that
is
about
all
it
is
a
better
than
most
mass
produced
beers
but
is
still
lacking
enjoy
though
if
you
are
a
hipster
i
had
it
poured
from
the
tap
d
it
is
very
easy
beer
to
drink
to
me
and
my
bro
it
is
just
like
drinking
water
on
a
side
note
no
other
beer
retains
its
flavor
like
pbr
whether
it
is
warm
or
cold
the
taste
is
the
same
excellent
camping
beer
ddrinkable
as
one
of
the
brews
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
with
which
to
session
drinkability
one
of
the
best
of
the
cheapo
american
beers
along
with
miller
high
life
though
pbr
is
way
better
than
mhl
but
schlitz
still
takes
the
crown
drk
as
good
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
d
well
its
mfing
pbr
drinkability
is
fairly
high
because
its
light
as
hell
notes
i
did
like
this
one
better
than
like
a
miller
or
coors
i
found
it
more
bearable
and
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
at
the
party
probably
one
of
the
best
value
beers
on
the
market
its
a
nice
change
up
from
a
world
filled
with
dopplebocks
and
imperial
stouts
poured
into
my
pilsner
glass
a
pale
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
on
top
little
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
cheap
grains
sweet
corn
and
bread
the
mouth
is
really
thin
and
wet
very
slick
flavor
is
cheap
and
buttery
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
but
thats
expected
i
liked
this
in
the
past
but
this
is
not
that
good
now
the
best
value
around
here
as
i
can
get
a
pitcher
of
it
anytime
for
3
tastes
better
than
the
other
american
macros
and
more
drinkable
as
well
ive
drank
so
much
of
this
stuff
im
sure
its
part
of
my
dna
i
only
hope
they
dont
use
any
genetically
modified
ingredients
this
is
the
best
beer
for
your
money
being
a
poor
college
student
i
cant
find
a
better
deal
most
bars
do
5
pitchers
and
a
12
pack
is
7
its
not
fancy
and
its
not
going
to
blow
your
mind
in
any
way
but
it
sure
beats
bud
coors
miller
any
day
of
the
week
it
won
a
blue
ribbon
didnt
it
d
easily
one
of
the
toughest
beers
for
me
to
choke
down
i
cant
find
much
good
to
say
about
this
beer
but
ill
refrain
from
bashing
it
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
options
out
there
as
far
as
macros
go
obviously
id
prefer
craft
beer
but
this
isnt
a
terrible
backup
this
is
very
drinkable
and
for
the
price
is
hard
to
beat
pretty
good
for
my
go
to
beer
nice
and
light
good
cold
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
i
used
to
drink
busch
but
this
shit
is
way
better
great
color
on
tap
or
even
out
of
the
can
had
a
sweet
keg
of
it
on
july
4th
doesnt
get
much
more
american
than
that
enjoy
with
a
nice
veggie
burger
light
bodied
with
lots
of
fizzy
carbonation
overall
pretty
inoffensive
and
makes
for
a
good
cheap
guzzler
on
a
hot
day
nothing
special
just
an
easy
drinking
americanstyle
lager
i
think
pbr
has
become
more
trendy
lately
as
the
price
of
a
30rack
has
went
up
from
13
to
17
still
its
cheaper
than
the
big
3
and
definetely
better
as
well
seems
to
be
hoppier
and
creamier
on
tap
than
from
the
can
or
bottle
solid
choice
when
youre
low
on
funds
d
you
can
definitely
put
down
a
lot
of
them
and
pbr
is
a
lot
better
tasting
than
most
beers
in
this
style
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
macro
lagers
around
but
still
isnt
anything
special
but
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
few
pbrs
definitely
hit
the
spot
other
than
that
its
on
par
if
not
slightly
above
in
taste
and
drinkability
when
compared
to
other
commercial
american
adjunct
lagers
d
well
its
drinkable
for
sureone
of
those
beers
you
could
pound
back
a
few
but
im
not
sure
if
that
makes
it
a
beer
you
would
want
to
spend
the
time
enjoying
and
drinking
throughout
the
night
poured
from
a
24
ounce
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
very
tasty
on
a
hot
day
sweet
corny
taste
nice
and
cold
this
is
a
favorite
for
the
price
it
is
a
classic
dont
look
for
anything
special
just
expect
a
solid
great
american
made
classic
this
beer
flows
down
on
a
hot
day
typical
american
macro
imo
except
that
it
excels
in
taste
and
drinkability
and
for
the
price
i
think
i
found
a
new
beer
to
keep
my
fridge
stocked
with
other
than
yuengling
lager
which
is
slightly
heavier
pbr
seems
to
be
a
love
it
or
hate
it
beer
overall
but
id
have
to
say
i
love
it
decent
american
adjunct
but
alot
cheaper
and
tastier
i
was
pleasently
surprised
notes
this
beer
is
far
from
perfect
but
if
your
having
a
drunken
party
and
need
alot
of
beer
for
cheap
that
you
can
stomach
with
a
smile
theres
no
better
place
to
turn
value
wise
this
beer
gets
a
5
d
very
drinkable
super
cheap
refreshing
i
think
this
is
my
new
go
to
30pack
for
13
dollars
crazy
nice
hop
smack
though
perfect
for
a
session
on
a
nice
hot
day
i
dont
normally
buy
macros
but
i
have
not
had
a
pbr
in
quite
some
time
super
light
yellow
in
color
generous
billowing
head
it
looks
like
the
stereotypical
fizzy
yellow
lager
smells
like
an
earthy
lager
not
bad
at
all
more
earthiness
in
the
flavor
minerals
a
fleeting
hint
of
sweet
fruitiness
for
the
price
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
makes
a
very
good
summer
bbqpiciniclawnmower

i

my

stuff
one
december
evening
she
glanced
over
looked
at
my
can
and
said
i
guess
were
all
out
of
money
this
time
of
night
a
classic
cheers
i
will
still
pick
up
a
six
pack
every
now
and
then
for
a
picnic
or
day
at
the
beach
was
a
thin
bodied
beer
with
alot
of
carbonation
i
could
put
alot
of
them
down
though
with
out
feeling
them
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
slightly
flat
but
very
drinkable
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
after
some
physical
labor
fine
for
a
macro
actually
pretty
good
for
a
macro
this
simpler
times
and
gansett
would
be
my
gotos
to
keep
around
for
that
kind
of
thing
pours
a
yellow
color
which
is
very
light
with
a
small
one
finger
head
the
smell
is
of
cheap
grains
the
grain
smell
is
of
rice
and
corn
not
as
faint
as
other
macros
the
taste
is
of
grain
rice
and
corn
the
mouthfeel
is
of
very
high
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
average
for
a
macro
not
too
bad
not
too
good
more
flavor
than
most
macors
its
a
beer
for
modern
livin
pabst
blue
ribbon
is
great
to
use
in
a
large
container
when
cooking
bratwurst
prior
to
hitting
the
grill
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
will
stick
with
stag
as
my
goto
macro
overall
my
favorite
macro
dont
let
my
poor
review
distract
you
if
you
are
strapped
for
cash
reach
for
pbr
d
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
or
just
to
get
a
buzz
when
your
broke
i
like
this
beer
alot
its
way
better
than
the
coors
bud
and
miller
from
a
12
oz
can
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smells
of
corn
and
malts
taste
is
crispsome
malts
finishes
somewhat
bitter
not
bad
but
not
full
of
flavor
feels
watery
in
the
mouth
it
is
fairly
drinkable
good
for
drinking
games
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
price
tag
drinkablity
one
of
the
most
drinkable
macros
out
there
its
a
staple
goto
thirst
quencher
for
me
if
youre
looking
for
complexity
and
full
bodiedness
then
an
american
adjunct
lager
aal
is
not
going
to
make
the
cut
if
you
want
to
quench
your
thirst
or
throw
back
a
few
beers
then
this
is
a
great
option
i
cant
stand
guys
that
give
this
and
other
decent
aals
bad
ratings
just
because
its
not
a
kick
you
in
the
ass
full
bodied
sipper
you
need
to
respect
the
style
respect
beer
drinkability
has
always
been
my
go
to
macro
when
i
have
one
the
only
one
i
stock
on
a
semiregular
basis
in
my
own
home
drinkable
any
day
normally
im
not
a
big
fan
of
adjunct
lagers
but
pbr
gets
props
in
my
book
for
being
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
the
vast
majority
of
other
beers
of
this
style
and
that
it
can
be
found
for
very
cheap
more
so
than
bud
miller
or
coors
a
good
option
for
something
cheap
or
party
beer
its
no
craft
brew
but
thats
not
what
its
meant
to
be
the
best
of
its
kind
in
my
opinion
d
if
im
having
this
style
of
beer
winding
down
on
a
hot
day
or
after
workingplaying
outdoors
this
is
a
fine
one
to
reach
for
not
in
my
regular
rotation
but
certainly
easy
to
drink
when
i
do
have
reason
to
have
one
pbr
carries
a
stigma
locally
as
a
hipster
beer
for
whatever
reason
gaining
favor
with
the
cool
kids
several
years
ago
though
theres
plenty
of
great
local
craft
options
here
i
suppose
they
could
do
worse
than
quaffing
down
assloads
of
pbr
i
can
appreciate
as
being
among
the
best
of
its
kind
this
is
yet
another
kegger
beer
perfect
for
getting
hammered
and
little
else
a
beer
pong
staple
goes
good
with
pizza
too
it
is
good
for
a
really
cheap
beer
i
have
to
give
it
that
for
what
it
is
i
guess
i
cant
complain
it
tops
the
light
beers
but
still
is
far
from
good
in
my
book
ill
pass
on
this
one
every
time
there
are
much
better
adjunct
lagers
out
there
including
coors
originalblatz
among
others
better
than
expected
for
a
cheap
beer
it
has
more
flavor
of
hops
than
any
other
similarly
priced
beer
ive
had
from
the
can
the
beer
tends
to
be
over
carbonated
but
is
normally
better
ontap
my
personal
favorite
from
the
cheap
easy
to
drink
category
meh
its
pbr
its
not
very
good
but
thats
not
why
you
buy
it
since
im
pretty
sure
everyone
has
had
this
or
knows
someone
who
has
all
ill
add
is
i
prefer
high
life
for
the
price
point
something
in
the
flavor
just
didnt
apeal
to
me
perhaps
ill
try
this
on
tap
one
day
and
see
if
its
any
better
but
for
the
can
dont
bother
trying
lawn
mowing
and
golfing
i
could
drink
this
anytime
oh
and
floating
on
the
river
in
need
of
some
good
cheap
beer
to
bring
along
drinkability
this
isnt
bad
its
not
the
best
thing
ive
ever
had
but
it
has
its
charm
d
its
pbr
normally
i
wouldnt
go
near
this
type
of
beer
but
i
was
at
a
wedding
over
the
weekend
and
the
reception
was
a
macrofest
and
this
was
the
best
offering
no
glassware
to
be
had
so
i
had
it
straight
from
the
can
very
muted
smell
not
as
grainy
as
i
expected
given
the
type
slight
metallic
aroma
and
taste
which
is
to
be
expected
pretty
watery
but
very
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
over
all
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
not
sorry
i
had
it
but
wont
look
for
it
again
this
is
a
very
cheap
beer
you
get
what
you
pay
for
but
out
of
all
the
cheap
beers
this
isnt
a
horrible
choice
especially
when
you
compare
it
to
the
buds
or
millers
it
is
actually
better
while
anyone
would
prefer
a
better
quality
beer
this
is
not
a
horrible
cost
effective
way
to
go
for
those
on
a
very
tight
budget
i
went
for
a
hot
dog
at
crif
dogs
in
nyc
and
for
a
dollar
extra
i
got
myself
a
pbr
to
be
honest
it
wasnt
as
sour
as
i
had
expected
it
really
lacked
any
real
taste
it
was
almost
like
a
beer
version
of
vitamin
water
sans
the
health
kick
what
ever
for
a
buck
you
get
what
you
get
as
expected
the
body
was
nearly
nonexistent
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
in
the
same
way
water
is
avoid
this
beer
its
poured
a
very
yellow
golden
color
with
little
white
head
and
too
much
carbonation
the
smell
was
what
you
expect
from
and
adjuct
corny
and
grainy
it
tasted
very
differetn
from
the
usual
bmc
beers
though
a
bit
sweeter
maybe
im
not
sure
how
to
nail
it
not
bad
though
it
felt
like
water
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
great
awesome
session
beer
for
the
price
not
bad
at
all
out
of
a
can
this
infamous
hipster
beer
was
a
bleached
gold
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
the
retention
of
a
thin
layer
of
foam
and
a
collar
was
good
and
the
lacing
was
in
bands
at
first
then
streaks
later
on
the
semisweet
aroma
was
of
macro
grains
sweet
corn
pale
malt
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
flavors
were
dry
and
semisweet
pale
malt
a
little
bright
citrus
grains
lots
of
acidity
and
a
crisp
finish
clean
and
refreshing
definitely
a
step
above
its
comparable
cohorts
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
a
bit
slick
and
oily
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
mediumhigh
d
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
like
a
potato
chip
once
you
pop
the
top
you
cant
stop
d
i
have
to
admit
this
has
some
nostalgic
appeal
for
me
because
my
grandmother
drank
this
religiously
but
its
actually
fairly
decent
on
its
own
merits
definitely
the
best
of
the
supercheap
beers
i
hate
to
admit
it
but
the
hipsters
might
be
on
to
something
drinkability
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
this
is
cold
its
a
really
nice
choice
to
have
around
if
other
brews
arent
available
for
the
price
its
tough
to
beat
for
a
barbecue
certainly
there
are
better
beers
read
much
much
more
flavor
and
complexity
but
i
wont
knock
on
pbr
with
everything
else
thats
out
there
maybe
a
touch
better
all
things
being
relative
than
many
of
the
other
adjunct
lagers
that
ive
had
from
south
of
the
border
or
here
for
that
matter
but
it
may
very
well
be
time
to
cut
or
just
plain
give
up
that
goddamned
ribbon
already
better
than
bud
and
miller
a
refreshing
take
on
mass
quantity
beer
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
to
be
honest
it
doesnt
make
you
have
to
think
about
it
not
impressive
at
all
but
also
a
good
beer
for
the
summertime
and
a
steady
stand
by
when
the
going
gets
tough
d
awesome
summer
session
lawnmower
whatever
you
call
it
quality
extremely
cheap
and
tasty
despite
the
less
than
steller
reviews
pbr
is
the
best
cheap
beer
money
can
buy
it
is
essentially
like
drinking
alcoholic
water
if
your
short
on
cash
but
want
to
throw
a
few
down
dont
deviate
with
other
crappy
mass
produced
american
lagers
grab
a
pbr
pbr
always
impresses
here
is
a
very
inexpensive
beer
that
while
very
good
in
a
bottle
is
even
better
on
tap
when
served
at
4045
degrees
f
and
drunk
relatively
quickly
pbr
is
one
of
the
most
satisfying
warm
weather
brews
bar
none
it
is
head
and
shoulders
better
than
the
big
3
and
is
a
cut
above
molson
canadian
lager
and
many
microw
brews
which
cost
significantly
more
money
the
character
is
malty
with
nice
smooth
body
and
vanilla
notes
predominate
the
hops
are
faint
but
pleasant
something
unusal
at
this
price
point
tastes
very
grainy
husky
and
a
bit
dirty
but
overall
not
a
bad
american
macro
this
is
one
of
the
few
macros
ive
had
that
actually
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
real
german
pilsner
kiss
of
hops
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
pbr
lets
hope
that
you
dont
have
to
i
had
not
had
a
pbr
in
years
i
shall
purchase
another
6
good
slammer
beer
good
for
bbq
spicy
food
etc
cheap
too
for
sitting
and
chillin
heavy
beer
serious
eatin
of
greasy
spicy
working
mans
food
bingo
d
one
of
my
favorite
cheap
beers
its
not
half
bad
and
it
certainly
is
an
easy
drinker
probably
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
it
outside
a
can
drinkability
in
the
battle
of
cheap
american
adjuncts
this
is
king
we
all
know
its
nothing
special
but
thats
the
point
its
a
nonpretentious
simple
beer
for
when
things
get
tedious
you
can
relax
and
have
a
few
because
you
know
its
cheap
dont
even
bother
taking
it
out
the
can
its
better
that
way
so
bring
it
anywhere
i
love
craft
beer
tasting
and
drinking
it
are
a
big
part
of
my
life
but
sometimes
drinking
expensive
beers
at
parties
or
just
for
the
hell
of
it
well
can
get
expensive
so
to
make
this
already
long
story
short
this
is
a
cheap
as
dirt
beer
thats
drinkable
plus
itll
get
you
drunk
drinkability
i
dont
know
im
looking
forward
to
finishing
this
so
i
can
enjoy
something
real
what
a
waste
a
beer
like
this
has
good
drinkability
as
for
how
many
of
these
one
can
take
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
easy
to
put
this
one
away
cheers
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
large
short
lived
fizzy
white
head
aroma
of
hops
corn
and
subtle
berry
fruits
slightly
metallic
taste
accents
of
malt
and
corn
slightly
bland
but
better
than
many
others
for
the
price
not
very
interesting
but
not
bad
at
all
overall
i
must
say
that
i
am
impressed
by
this
beer
not
simply
because
of
the
bargain
price
for
which
i
bought
it
but
because
i
think
it
tastes
good
i
have
heard
a
lot
of
harsh
comments
about
pbr
but
i
have
to
say
that
it
is
in
my
book
a
highly
underrated
beer
there
is
not
much
to
a
pbr
classic
american
pilsner
as
light
as
water
with
about
as
much
taste
but
unlike
water
pbr
is
5
a
great
beer
for
a
buck
in
a
can
at
almost
any
bar
around
town
personally
i
find
myself
spending
money
at
beer
stores
rather
than
bars
due
to
the
mark
up
so
pbr
is
nothing
to
rave
about
but
it
is
cheep
drinkable
and
gets
the
job
done
as
i
say
to
my
beer
snob
friends
it
is
the
best
of
the
worst
and
now
pabst
is
the
oldest
american
owned
brewery
in
the
country
america
fuck
yeah
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
goldenyellow
color
with
a
very
small
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
straw
and
grains
flavor
is
corn
straw
and
maybe
a
light
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
light
watery
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
mainly
just
an
altogether
bland
beer
not
offensive
drinkable
but
not
all
that
good
overall
great
cheap
evreryday
beer
especially
in
this
economy
look
forward
to
putting
a
few
back
tonight
maybe
its
not
even
beermaybe
its
a
sort
of
alcoholic
corn
soda
but
whatever
you
call
it
i
will
certainly
have
another
ill
try
it
in
a
can
and
i
hope
its
as
good
in
a
can
as
it
is
in
a
bottle
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
texture
begins
nice
and
prickly
with
the
bubbles
very
small
and
alive
it
does
thin
out
in
a
few
seconds
but
it
never
ends
up
too
boring
besides
my
last
experience
with
ballantine
a
few
years
back
this
is
the
only
macro
i
can
recall
actually
enjoying
from
a
glass
an
easy
choice
for
the
big
bbqs
this
year
until
things
turn
around
economically
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
recedes
to
lacing
the
aroma
doesnt
present
much
but
a
lightly
malty
lager
smell
the
taste
is
once
again
predominantly
of
light
malt
and
whatever
it
is
those
little
bottom
feeders
do
the
mouthfeel
is
of
course
light
with
a
crisp
aggressive
level
of
carbonation
of
course
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
that
makes
the
drinkability
all
that
great
pabst
blue
ribbon
pours
a
mild
yellow
in
my
glass
the
head
is
just
one
shade
darker
than
a
miller
high
life
smells
and
tastes
better
than
your
average
american
adjunct
lager
there
is
a
little
something
better
here
than
most
other
american
adjunct
lagers
it
has
a
somewhat
pleasant
flavor
that
i
could
drink
from
time
to
time
beats
out
miller
high
life
by
a
few
point
and
is
now
my
favorite
aal
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
crisp
pilsner
malt
and
adjunct
scent
thats
light
and
dry
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
pilsner
malt
flavor
that
low
on
hops
and
clean
in
the
finish
its
a
warm
weather
brew
no
doubt
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
its
one
of
the
only
macro
lagers
i
drink
md
smooth
as
water
feel
with
a
mild
dry
ending
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
make
you
feel
like
crap
in
the
morning
after
mass
drinking
sessions
d
definitely
a
beer
that
goes
down
easily
i
was
through
my
mug
in
a
flash
pbr
does
its
job
without
much
fanfare
its
at
least
on
par
with
the
more
expensive
bmc
mainstays
perhaps
this
is
my
new
yard
work
beer
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
cookout
with
friends
and
a
grill
great
summer
beer
does
its
job
as
a
refreshing
beverage
i
would
take
a
narragansett
over
it
any
time
though
while
in
the
new
england
area
d
buy
a
30
its
so
cheap
and
see
how
many
ou
can
throw
back
haha
not
recomended
gave
my
a
killer
hangover
very
average
drinkability
easy
because
its
so
weak
overall
this
is
one
macro
i
could
keep
stocked
in
my
fridge
i
never
thought
i
could
enjoy
a
beer
this
cheep
but
it
exceeded
my
expectations
by
far
cheers
to
pbr
the
best
of
the
worst
it
had
a
nice
golden
appearance
with
a
decent
head
i
got
a
wheatycereal
aroma
it
was
dry
and
crisp
and
pretty
drinkable
this
isnt
the
most
flavorful
beer
and
fairly
typical
for
an
adjunct
lager
but
it
should
not
be
totally
discounted
a
good
beer
for
when
you
are
done
cutting
the
lawn
goes
down
good
but
seriously
for
4
a
six
pack
you
could
be
doing
a
lot
worse
respect
beer
respect
pbr
hey
it
won
a
blue
ribbon
at
some
point
didnt
it
what
else
can
i
add
d
drinkable
much
better
than
standard
adjunct
lagers
drinkability
i
can
drink
this
refreshing
beer
any
time
its
great
with
bbq
and
grilled
food
its
carbonation
it
great
for
celebrating
events
because
its
a
champagne
of
beer
oh
wait
i
think
thats
taken
drinkability
in
reality
while
i
may
have
had
a
rough
bottle
and
it
theres
truly
nothing
that
strikes
me
as
remotely
remarkable
about
it
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
because
it
is
so
light
and
easy
take
that
for
what
it
is
to
drink
dflows
like
honey
this
has
officially
replaced
old
style
as
my
cheap
lager
of
choice
hows
that
for
high
praise
drinkability
is
the
strong
suit
for
this
brew
i
drank
mine
right
after
mowing
the
lawn
in
the
warm
florida
sun
it
went
down
easy
and
tasted
pretty
good
for
the
price
this
is
a
good
brew
to
keep
around
for
hot
summer
days
and
friends
or
neighbors
who
prefer
macro
lagers
i
like
this
beer
atmosphere
is
kinda
what
youd
expect
from
a
macro
brew
not
much
to
speak
of
flavor
is
more
than
serviceable
feel
is
nonoffensive
overall
decent
quaff
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
comfortably
above
average
as
far
as
macros
go
a
friend
of
mine
drinks
this
beer
often
and
offers
me
one
now
and
then
at
first
i
tried
to
get
used
to
the
tasteif
you
call
it
that
but
now
i
cant
stand
it
its
probably
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
d
a
very
simple
premium
lager
clean
and
light
i
find
this
to
be
much
more
bearable
than
say
budweiser
or
miller
a
goto
beer
for
pizza
or
other
such
cheap
foods
and
great
to
enjoy
with
friends
its
not
something
i
would
stick
with
all
the
time
or
even
most
of
the
time
yet
its
uncomplicated
and
can
be
a
great
change
of
pace
from
heavy
or
pretentious
beers
d
easily
the
most
drinkable
and
clean
of
the
adjunct
lagers
the
faint
hop
character
makes
this
seem
like
a
decent
beer
when
faced
with
pour
choices
can
be
consumed
very
easily
in
mass
quantities
and
is
actually
a
bit
refreshing
its
fun
to
take
a
break
from
really
intense
beers
and
ever
once
in
a
while
just
crack
open
a
can
of
simple
decent
brew
pbr
is
certainly
not
the
greatest
beer
ever
but
for
what
it
is
and
how
much
it
costs
its
difficult
to
beat
its
bright
yellow
impossibly
clear
energetically
carbonated
and
it
hangs
onto
a
layer
of
head
for
long
enough
to
respect
the
smell
is
pure
simple
clean
corn
and
other
adjuncts
the
flavor
is
acceptable
theres
a
tiny
tang
of
metallic
discordance
in
there
but
its
not
loud
enough
to
be
offensive
other
than
that
this
is
a
light
refreshing
clean
and
simple
beer
easy
to
drink
and
feels
good
in
my
mouth
the
taste
is
similar
and
like
the
bottle
or
can
grain
with
a
light
grassy
hop
bite
with
the
faintest
hint
of
lemon
clean
flavours
and
a
light
crisp
bitterness
compared
to
the
can
or
bottle
on
tap
it
has
an
even
stronger
fuller
more
lasting
taste
of
strong
fresh
grain
that
lingers
long
after
the
finish
drinkability
its
pbr
you
can
drink
a
few
without
even
noticing
overall
its
never
going
to
be
fantastic
but
its
nothing
to
scoff
at
especially
for
the
price
always
my
choice
over
bmc
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
i
remember
having
a
more
flavorful
pbr
in
the
past
what
happened
this
time
around
no
flavor
watery
to
lite
and
no
aroma
it
definitely
left
something
to
be
desired
and
im
frankly
a
little
disappointed
on
the
other
hand
this
beer
is
highly
sessionable
easy
to
toss
back
a
few
on
a
warm
day
or
drink
all
night
i
think
i
might
go
with
bud
over
this
though
just
wasnt
impressed
with
this
one
id
pass
overall
this
beer
is
not
something
id
buy
but
i
still
like
it
over
other
macros
such
as
the
dreaded
bud
if
nothing
else
ill
drink
it
in
honor
of
blue
velvet
pbr
overall
my
favorite
of
the
cheap
brews
during
such
pressing
economic
times
you
shouldnt
feel
the
need
to
cut
back
on
flavor
even
if
you
need
to
cut
back
on
price
as
an
already
broke
college
student
i
have
no
qualms
about
suggesting
this
fine
beer
for
any
occasion
this
is
one
heck
of
a
value
for
the
and
i
wish
other
brands
at
this
price
point
could
compare
to
the
almighty
pbr
whether
watching
the
big
game
or
out
grilling
with
neighbors
no
beer
is
more
drinkable
than
pabst
blue
ribbon
d
i
have
to
say
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
during
the
summer
in
a
session
but
im
going
to
put
the
rest
of
this
12
pack
on
hold
for
now
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
sudsy
white
lacing
which
quickly
dissipates
aroma
is
pretty
onedimensional
with
light
grain
corn
hay
with
the
faintest
whiff
of
some
light
fruit
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
accurate
for
the
style
light
and
loose
with
lots
of
spiky
carbonation
taste
is
like
the
nose
although
there
is
a
little
bit
more
evidence
of
the
hops
although
still
negligible
not
overly
sweet
finishes
a
little
dry
drinkability
is
high
since
i
basically
use
this
beer
as
a
substitute
for
soda
overall
this
beer
exemplifies
its
style
very
well
it
is
not
totally
devoid
of
flavor
and
it
also
doesnt
smash
you
over
the
head
with
sweetness
like
yuengling
traditional
does
6
50
a
12pack
doesnt
hurt
either
best
in
america
in
1893
times
have
changed
i
know
this
wasnt
the
best
formatted
review
but
i
cant
contribute
anything
that
hasnt
already
been
said
and
by
more
eloquent
reviewers
just
wanted
to
give
my
endorsement
fwiw
drinkability
this
is
where
i
feel
pbr
shines
the
smooth
balanced
and
not
overlystrong
pbr
can
be
drank
in
the
dozens
great
for
tailgating
block
parties
and
basically
situations
where
you
will
be
drinking
all
day
drinkability
great
if
you
dont
mind
the
smell
theres
not
much
to
overwhelm
you
here
ill
leave
this
one
to
13
year
old
kids
who
are
trying
to
get
sponsored
in
snowboarding
overall
standard
mouthfeel
for
the
style
maybe
a
little
on
the
carbonated
side
very
drinkable
as
well
one
of
my
favorite
adjuncts
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
i
have
when
all
is
said
and
done
i
think
this
might
be
the
most
highly
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
encountered
even
for
an
american
lager
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
the
carbonation
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
but
if
you
just
take
your
time
it
shouldnt
be
a
barrier
this
is
a
great
beer
when
you
arent
needingwanting
a
great
beer
its
great
with
some
bbq
or
just
kicking
back
watching
a
game
or
after
some
yard
work
this
beer
poured
alight
yellow
with
a
singlefinger
head
that
didnt
last
long
with
a
lot
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
grainy
malt
thats
very
typical
of
the
style
the
taste
is
slightly
sweetness
that
doesnt
last
long
with
a
pretty
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
crisp
due
to
the
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
by
design
not
the
worst
sixpack
you
can
get
if
you
only
have
4
but
theres
definitely
a
reason
it
hasnt
won
an
award
since
1893
poured
from
the
blueribbon
can
into
a
glass
this
brew
has
a
thin
looking
golden
wheat
color
with
a
little
white
head
that
fizzles
down
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
rice
corn
and
light
malts
the
taste
is
clean
a
little
watery
nice
crisp
carbonation
and
some
light
alcohol
after
taste
honestly
on
a
day
when
all
i
did
was
house
work
and
had
a
mighty
thirst
this
hit
the
spot
for
the
price
almost
cant
beat
i
do
not
see
what
the
hype
is
about
this
beer
aside
from
the
fact
that
its
cheap
but
so
are
natural
light
and
milwaukees
best
it
tastes
salty
and
does
not
feel
good
on
the
palate
it
sets
really
heavy
too
i
will
spend
the
extra
money
to
get
a
better
quality
beer
any
day
pbr
has
the
look
and
feel
of
a
bmc
product
yellow
color
thin
head
and
robust
carbonation
i
think
where
this
beer
differers
is
in
the
taste
it
has
a
little
bit
better
taste
than
a
bmc
but
not
by
much
the
malt
presence
is
slightly
more
noticeable
but
other
than
that
its
still
very
grainy
and
hints
of
corn
for
the
price
difference
for
a
61224
pack
its
really
anybodys
call
d
its
hard
to
review
this
its
my
go
tomacro
beer
but
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
really
have
anything
that
im
looking
for
in
a
beer
for
the
style
its
one
of
the
best
ones
as
far
as
im
concerned
but
in
the
grand
scope
of
all
that
is
beer
its
weak
as
best
take
this
with
a
grain
of
salt
im
sure
noone
on
here
is
looking
for
insight
when
it
comes
time
to
choose
the
best
30
can
beer
however
i
find
this
the
easiest
to
consume
of
all
of
its
peers
d
what
can
i
say
i
like
this
beer
its
very
clean
and
has
a
grainy
somewhat
rugged
character
for
such
a
mainstream
beer
every
time
i
try
to
hate
on
pbr
i
just
cant
make
myself
do
it
i
know
its
a
cheap
american
macro
but
it
is
probably
one
of
the
best
representatives
of
that
genre
for
some
reason
pbr
carries
more
of
an
image
than
the
others
bud
miller
coors
and
demands
at
least
some
respect
from
other
bar
patrons
appears
lightbut
goldenwith
a
fragile
and
fast
departing
head
decent
lace
classic
aroma
easy
drinkingwith
knock
out
taste
pairs
well
with
most
anything
off
the
grill
grab
some
friendssome
pbrand
relax
this
beer
pair
perfectly
with
a
pizza
or
a
burger
drinkability
is
hard
to
match
in
the
style
and
it
is
very
sessionable
it
is
going
to
be
my
09
summer
beer
i
have
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
but
i
was
holding
out
for
the
bottle
which
is
a
little
harder
to
find
i
am
very
pleased
and
excited
to
have
a
new
standard
in
my
beer
arsenal
thanks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
macro
should
mouthfeel
ok
drinkability
is
excellent
at
about
35f
but
go
above
40
and
watch
out
pbr
is
a
decent
macro
swill
but
budweiser
is
the
best
coors
banquet
schmidt
schlitz
and
schells
o
are
better
i
guess
when
it
comes
down
to
american
macro
it
is
really
about
personal
preference
one
guy
might
like
pbr
the
next
guy
bud
or
highlife
or
whatever
you
like
to
drink
the
point
is
its
american
macro
or
as
i
like
to
call
it
real
beer
and
thats
why
you
drink
it
amen
d
easy
as
fk
to
drink
if
a
little
boring
overall
i
cant
understand
why
pbr
has
become
the
king
of
cheap
beers
nothing
special
at
all
the
taste
is
well
quite
good
actually
the
hops
are
noticeable
and
the
beer
goes
down
extremely
smooth
it
is
light
tasting
and
the
adjuncts
are
most
certainly
there
but
shit
id
take
this
over
any
bmc
any
day
for
what
it
is
macro
adjunct
lager
its
one
of
my
favorites
i
could
pound
a
good
number
of
these
in
simple
words
this
is
just
a
straight
up
standard
easy
drinking
beer
its
cheap
wherever
you
go
typically
like
2
dollar
drafts
or
3
dollar
16oz
cans
at
bars
or
clubs
and
you
are
getting
what
you
pay
for
more
tasty
than
the
big
three
offerings
and
always
hits
the
spot
even
more
so
with
bbq
or
a
nice
juicy
burger
good
townie
bar
beer
consumed
out
of
frosted
pint
at
my
local
bar
at
a
dollar
a
pint
you
really
cant
go
wrong
if
you
lookin
to
get
wasted
on
macro
swills
its
a
great
crispclean
american
macro
lager
not
much
else
to
say
about
it
i
like
to
have
one
to
cleanse
the
palate
every
now
and
then
the
original
you
might
be
a
redneck
if
hail
to
pabst
ive
had
plenty
of
these
over
the
last
few
years
when
wanting
something
not
particularly
heavy
nor
needing
to
be
thought
over
its
a
cheap
beer
that
tasted
not
bad
before
but
seems
to
be
slightly
better
now
in
fact
unlike
other
macros
where
it
would
be
near
impossible
to
taste
any
malt
usually
they
are
tasteless
or
full
of
corn
flavors
this
beer
does
seem
to
present
some
malt
sweetness
that
normally
id
associate
with
traditional
lagers
whether
foreign
or
domestic
still
not
much
in
the
department
of
hops
bitterness
or
floral
citruslike
flavors
maybe
ive
bought
a
bad
batch
that
means
it
was
mistakenly
made
better
or
my
taste
buds
are
improving
or
dying
you
choose
regardless
im
enjoying
these
now
for
the
price
this
is
an
honest
beer
with
no
complaints
id
say
it
is
above
the
average
mark
and
for
the
price
it
cannot
be
beat
definitely
towers
over
coors
miller
you
name
it
do
yourself
a
favor
when
youre
going
out
to
buy
a
case
of
a
beer
that
is
on
the
cheaper
side
stick
with
pbr
or
oldstyle
oldstyle
tastes
the
same
as
pbr
in
my
experience
not
the
original
oldstyle
it
just
has
more
of
a
bite
very
refreshing
on
a
summer
day
i
know
from
experience
taste
is
similar
to
most
cheap
beers
very
light
easy
to
drink
more
than
you
should
nothing
too
great
but
would
take
a
blue
ribbon
over
a
bud
light
any
day
pbr
is
a
drinking
to
drink
beer
and
nothing
else
but
hey
were
supposed
to
reveiw
these
things
for
what
they
are
not
what
we
want
them
to
be
do
you
complain
when
an
ipa
tastes
like
hops
i
drank
this
sitting
in
a
hot
tub
at
my
hotel
after
a
long
day
of
skiing
i
didnt
pour
it
from
the
can
but
looking
in
the
mouth
showed
me
what
i
already
knew
this
beer
is
about
as
clear
yellow
as
it
gets
the
smell
is
grainy
and
not
appealing
the
taste
isnt
much
better
metallic
like
licking
tin
but
not
so
much
so
that
it
was
offensive
like
many
beers
of
the
type
it
was
loaded
with
carbonation
that
stings
the
tongue
and
covers
some
of
the
lack
of
flavor
its
made
to
be
drinkable
and
it
probably
wouldnt
be
tough
to
spend
a
whole
night
knocking
these
back
d
any
beerfanatic
could
survive
happily
with
pbr
if
they
were
stranded
on
a
remote
island
and
this
was
the
only
beer
available
i
say
that
kindly
its
not
a
bad
standardstock
inexpensive
beer
for
basic
swilling
or
dining
i
cant
argue
when
i
just
bought
a
24bottle
case
for
12
in
january
2009
drinkability
well
one
thing
you
can
say
for
pbr
is
that
its
drinkable
its
downright
sessionable
this
is
a
very
light
beer
with
no
unpleasant
adjunct
flavors
among
the
better
american
pils
lagers
approximately
on
par
with
miller
high
life
taste
is
pretty
boring
it
isnt
bad
just
a
generic
lager
without
alot
to
it
overall
not
a
real
exciting
or
different
beer
but
not
a
bad
one
a
mediocre
brew
but
a
standard
of
mine
especially
in
this
economy
you
can
get
12
oz
cans
at
two
for
a
dollar
at
some
bars
thats
what
i
call
the
perfect
date
beer
overall
this
is
as
good
as
american
standards
get
freshness
definitely
matters
here
as
hop
character
will
quickly
fade
and
give
way
to
corn
the
typical
bmc
profile
when
fresh
and
served
at
a
reasonable
temp
not
half
frozen
this
beer
exemplifies
the
style
and
offers
a
thirst
quenching
delicate
beer
that
can
entertain
the
most
experienced
palate
nothing
much
to
say
about
this
brew
a
very
standard
beer
light
flavor
and
light
color
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
either
being
cheap
is
probably
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
if
youre
looking
for
quality
look
elsewhere
not
bad
for
parties
though
mouthfeel
watery
and
thin
its
hard
to
count
that
against
pbr
though
as
a
thin
mouthfeel
is
a
trademark
of
the
style
pbr
isnt
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
for
its
style
it
is
inoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
d
excellent
this
is
one
of
the
better
representations
of
the
style
it
fills
a
void
drinkability
would
be
ok
if
i
was
still
in
college
but
ive
moved
on
and
this
one
doesnt
cut
it
i
feel
i
owe
a
lot
to
this
beer
if
only
for
the
fact
that
it
has
brought
me
so
many
good
times
in
my
sometimes
turbulent
youth
when
my
ungovernable
instincts
sometimes
pabstinducedled
me
to
some
riotous
good
times
nothing
is
exceptional
about
this
beer
except
its
drinkability
you
could
drink
ten
of
these
and
still
talk
to
you
friends
about
how
cool
elo
is
coherently
so
again
all
you
2124
year
olds
enjoy
this
one
in
your
povertyridden
youth
it
will
only
last
until
you
discover
a
better
tasting
cheap
beer
like
schlitz
its
clean
and
fizzy
and
thin
and
you
can
slam
it
down
without
thinking
about
it
so
long
as
you
dont
actually
think
about
it
md
very
drinkable
especially
when
you
only
have
the
selection
of
macro
lagers
ill
pick
it
up
every
once
in
a
while
to
have
in
the
fridge
i
think
of
it
as
a
lawnmowing
beer
or
coors
of
the
three
i
think
it
tastes
most
like
bud
this
stuff
is
1
a
pint
on
tape
then
a
small
punch
of
hops
and
then
to
a
dryness
beer
coats
the
mouth
and
the
carbonation
helps
balance
the
dryness
overall

ki9ajul

sierra
nevada
this
is
i
think
the
best
of
the
cheap
section
does
have
a
slightly
fluffy
easy
drinker
theres
nothing
about
this
beer
that
i
can
criticize
to
a
strong
degree
it
does
the
style
well
i
do
think
it
sits
a
bit
heavier
with
me
than
others
so
maybe
not
the
easiest
drinker
around
i
think
id
rather
take
labatt
blue
or
schlitz
if
ive
got
to
have
a
macro
still
pretty
decent
stuff
though
d
pbr
is
a
highly
drinkable
macro
lagerits
flavors
arent
offensive
and
its
rather
refreshing
the
only
reason
i
gave
it
a
formal
review
is
that
its
relatively
hard
to
find
in
alabama
d
i
was
in
my
sunroom
on
a
hot
summer
night
72
degrees
and
boy
did
this
16oz
pour
go
down
nice
i
was
afraid
to
let
it
get
warm
but
for
these
instances
thats
not
a
hard
task
overall
i
recommend
this
as
a
good
cheap
summer
session
perfect
for
tailgating
large
gettogethers
or
having
a
nice
beer
after
a
long
day
of
yard
work
whatever
the
occassion
pbr
doesnt
fail
to
deliver
the
basic
incentives
of
beer
drinking
a
magnificent
diet
beer
with
an
oldschool
attitude
its
way
above
my
drinkable
threshold
when
adequately
cooled
but
earnestly
tasty
i
could
pop
back
2
or
3
in
the
bat
of
an
eye
and
think
little
of
it
i
like
it
pours
a
clear
goldenyellowy
color
slightly
darker
towards
the
edges
with
a
foamy
white
head
which
doesnt
last
too
long
and
leaves
some
thin
lacing
behind
its
got
that
grainygeneric
beery
smell
but
theres
a
bit
of
something
else
going
on
maybe
a
touch
of
lemon
nice
crisp
taste
a
little
hop
bitterness
detected
grainy
sweet
aftertaste
its
got
a
good
mouthfeel
not
too
watery
at
all
a
real
easy
drinker
especially
in
the
warmer
weather
i
also
got
this
out
of
my
grandfathers
beercigar
fridge
which
makes
the
whole
thing
that
much
more
enjoyable
the
appearance
is
pale
the
smell
is
of
sweet
corn
and
perhaps
a
hop
or
two
but
the
taste
is
classic
i
didnt
drink
pbr
for
years
but
since
i
tried
it
for
the
first
time
it
has
become
my
regular
i
love
a
good
microbrew
but
pbr
has
a
permanent
spot
in
my
fridge
whether
cooking
out
or
just
finished
mowing
the
yard
pbr
is
a
welcome
sight
easy
to
drink
but
so
is
water
i
guess
with
macro
lagers
the
less
taste
you
get
is
best
if
my
memory
serves
me
right
bud
and
miller
have
some
very
foul
flavors
in
there
which
this
beer
doesnt
nothing
offensive
to
slow
you
down
and
i
can
see
where
folks
going
after
a
cheap
buzz
might
like
it
especially
those
who
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
me
ill
stick
with
something
with
a
lot
more
flavor
i
have
on
a
pabst
kick
no
for
several
weeks
and
its
hard
to
get
off
of
it
i
must
say
for
having
more
the
50
different
selection
to
choose
from
i
go
for
a
pabst
first
drinkability
is
pretty
spot
on
and
for
7
99
a
12pack
pbr
is
really
a
great
deal
if
youre
in
the
mood
to
pound
a
few
down
with
steak
and
potatoes
my
go
to
beer
since
schlitz
came
and
went
again
for
when
you
just
need
a
beer
something
light
and
refreshing
i
drink
pbr
often
but
didnt
think
to
review
it
til
now
this
is
one
of
my
goto
brews
when
i
can
find
it
pbr
is
a
very
inexpensive
beer
yet
for
the
price
it
is
the
best
of
its
class
a
cheap
drinkable
beer
the
lightness
of
a
pbr
is
its
downfall
they
tend
to
go
down
like
water
for
the
first
few
there
is
the
tiniest
hint
of
hops
that
linger
around
after
a
swallow
the
texture
left
in
the
mouth
is
very
dry
with
no
flavor
too
strong
pbr
is
a
nicely
balanced
average
beer
its
a
wonderful
drink
for
someone
not
looking
to
spend
too
much
money
on
a
night
of
drinking
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
unless
its
on
draft
and
its
the
best
choice
at
the
place
i
find
myself
its
happened
before
this
is
a
highly
under
rated
beer
who
has
set
itself
apart
from
budweiser
this
is
getting
back
to
the
beer
our
fathers
generation
was
drinking
not
as
good
as
the
micros
but
as
for
a
mass
produced
nationwide
seller
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
and
something
to
knock
back
after
the
yard
work
clear
light
yellowy
gold

a
fairly
creamy
lid

a

brew
shame
ive
ignored
this
for
so
long
while
i
drop
into
the
summertime
lighter
beer
phase
i
think
this
will
be
a
good
simple
standby
to
have
in

up
a
pale

with
a
decentsized
pure

some

a
shortlived
cameo
in
the

bitterness
rounding
it

rather
watery
allaround
but
expected
not
particularly
big
on
mouthfeel
but
ontarget
for
the

seems
just
about
right
i
could
see
how
my
father
liked
to
keep
this
beer
in
the
extra
fridge
in
the
basement
a
nice
simple
beer
for
chasing
away
the
accumulated
stress
of
the
workday
mfd
light
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
craft
beer
by
far
but
than
again
nobody
ever
said
it
was
a
good
summer
pounder
just
watch
out
for
the
headache
it
tends
to
provide
you
with
one
of
the
better
macros
out
there
d
this
is
my
favorite
macro
and
is
a
very
versatile
beer
you
can
serve
it
very
cold
to
quench
your
thirst
when
working
in
the
yard
or
on
cars
or
it
can
be
served
slightly
warmer
and
more
hop
and
grain
tastes
comes
through
this
is
a
great
beer
when
you
just
feel
like
having
something
simple
and
tasty
plenty
of
carbonation
but
not
overpowering
nothing
astounding
but
not
bad
at
all
ummm
its
drinkable
but
it
has
a
weird
taste
but
goes
down
fast
seems
to
taste
better
really
cold
like
almost
freezing
would
buy
this
again
especially
for
the
price
10
for
a
case
drinkability
is
not
good
not
bad
either
ill
go
with
average
d
a
great
session
beer
or
something
to
drink
when
you
want
a
simple
beer
the
best
of
the
macros
as
mass
produced
canned
lager
goes
pbr
is
still
one
of
the
best
of
a
bad
bunch
it
wont
make
you
do
backflips
for
joy
at
the
wonder
of
it
but
its
a
good
cheap
drinkable
cookout
beer
cant
ask
for
anything
more
than
it
is
beats
big
three
and
will
always
be
my
favorite
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
macro
with
clean
flavors
and
character
despite
its
thinness
one
of
the
better
macro
lagers
out
there
cheers
like
i
said
this
is
the
beer
your
grandfather
drank
there
were
no
fancy
imports
microbreweries
brew
pubs
etc
after
a
hard
days
work
he
went
for
an
honest
beer
he
went
for
a
pbr
notes
i
get
a
case
of
pbr
1
a
month
from
my
neighbor
for
mowing
his
lawn
very
much
appreciated
also
my
weiser
drinking
friends
like
it
when
they
stop
by
to
bs
dhands
down
favorite
macro
there
is
nothing
impressive
about
this
beer
but
its
just
plain
decent
and
delivers
a
solidsimple
taste
that
sates
the
palate
when
you
dont
want
anything
complicated
this
is
hands
down
my
favourite
buck
a
beer
and
favourite
macro
for
sure
no
there
may
not
be
much
taste
but
it
doesnt
taste
awful
this
is
a
very
thirst
quenching
get
wasted
beer
with
no
hangover
included
it
pours
a
nice
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
head
that
leads
into
perfect
lacing
exceptionally
drinkable
great
cheap
beer
to
supply
the
masses
not
a
bad
macro
lager
and
a
good
deal
at
30
a
keg
this
is
a
good
one
to
drink
if
you
dont
want
to
experience
much
it
is
golden
yellow
with
a
tan
head
not
much
of
a
smell
some
bad
hops
the
taste
is
very
neutral
not
as
bad
a
most
of
this
style
feel
is
very
light
with
ample
carbonation
no
bad
off
flavors
but
not
much
flavor
at
all
either
pbr
or
die
it
is
what
it
is
it
is
not
made
by
trappist
monks
in
a
remote
belgian
monastery
it
is
not
made
by
an
eccentric
quebecois
obsessed
with
tradition
it
isnt
even
made
by
some
rabidly
insane
american
beer
fanatic
it
is
the
quintessential
cheap
american
beer
unusual
only
in
that
it
has
not
been
changed
for
a
century
or
more
and
the
company
doesnt
attempt
to
convince
you
that
drinking
its
product
will
cause
scantily
clad
women
to
materialize
randomly
and
start
having
sex
with
you
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
good
d
oh
yeah
no
worries
here
you
could
drink
it
until
the
blood
vessels
rupture
in
your
brain
or
at
least
until
your
liver
fails
after
the
first
two
you
dont
taste
anything
anyways
thats
why
this
is
one
of
the
ultimate
college
kid
swill
choices
and
for
good
reason
d
people
on
here
seem
to
rip
the
style
very
much
because
its
so
mass
produced
and
has
been
so
overdone
in
our
society
that
said
this
beer
is
good
for
a
warm
day
or
just
if
you
simply
want
a
basic
beer
as
far
as
lagers
go
pbr
and
yuengling
are
good
choices
ah
yes
good
old
dollaracan
pbrs
the
cheapest
beer
you
can
find
in
a
bar
i
didnt
bother
pouring
this
one
into
anything
just
chugged
it
from
the
can
tastes
like
any
other
mass
produced
lager
drink
it
with
your
buddies
and
dont
forget
to
tip
your
bartender
for
having
to
get
you
so
many
drinkablity
solidly
drinkable
american
brew
drinking
one
of
these
is
a
comforting
as
entering
the
city
limits
of
your
hometown
after
being
gone
for
years
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
regular
size
head
the
carbonation
is
adequate
for
the
style
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
aroma
along
with
that
mixture
of
malt
and
corn
the
crispness
of
the
hops
and
is
present
in
every
sip
something
not
really
execpted
from
a
macro
lager
the
body
is
thin
and
there
is
an
drying
aftertaste
that
builds
up
after
a
couple
but
if
im
drinking
macros
this
and
shlitz
are
probably
the
two
im
drinking
first
ive
read
some
of
the
reviews
and
couldnt
agree
more
with
most
of
them
i
started
out
drinking
pbr
because
it
was
the
only
beer
i
could
afford
while
paying
an
older
person
to
buy
it
for
me
what
dont
look
at
me
like
that
we
all
did
it
i
went
back
to
pbr
a
few
weeks
ago
after
a
four
year
long
sabatical
i
have
to
say
its
the
most
drinkable
macrocheap
beer
that
ive
ever
drank
and
yes
its
better
drank
through
a
beerbong
tastes
so
good
when
it
touches
your
lips
its
so
good
frank
overall
its
a
drinkable
beer
and
good
for
the
price
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
sweet
i
popped
open
my
first
can
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
i
really
like
this
beer
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
to
drink
but
if
the
money
isnt
in
my
pocket
to
buy
a
nice
belgium
i
would
purchase
this
what
year
did
they
win
the
blue
ribbon
1884
this
is
a
good
bbq
beer
with
the
boys
this
is
an
aboveaverage
macro
lager
it
smells
faintly
of
corn
and
grain
husk
the
corn
flavors
are
stronger
on
the
palate
with
hints
of
pale
malt
and
hops
but
the
corn
is
not
as
overpowering
as
miller
high
life
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
and
everybody
seems
to
find
it
at
least
palatable
this
is
the
one
to
get
when
the
going
is
cheap
i
wont
go
wholesale
into
pbr
but
if
im
at
this
bar
again
there
are
worse
choices
to
be
made
much
better
than
the
last
bud
product
i
had
a
perfect
change
up
when
things
get
a
bit
tedious
and
want
to
drink
a
simple
beer
well
put
great
gotobeer
drinkability
is
a
perfect
5
as
the
low
abv
and
more
than
decent
taste
means
you
and
your
buddies
can
smash
a
bunch
of
these
and
have
a
good
time
d
far
more
flavorable
than
many
macro
lagners
with
a
light
body
adn
low
abv
it
would
easily
outlast
a
long
session
decent
macro
with
good
drinkability
tastes
great
with
cornbread
mellow
flavor
that
doesnt
dominate
the
food
you
are
eating
pbr
is
truly
an
american
original
great
beer
at
a
great
price
drank
my
first
beer
out
of
a
dodger
blue
pint
glass
that
i
had
my
girlfriend
steal
in
her
purse
from
the
nearby
bar
the
roadhouse
pours
like
any
other
mac
lag
golden
yellow
body
with
a
fat
frothy
white
head
that
disapates
within
a
matter
of
15
seconds
settles
then
sparkles
with
a
multitude
of
champengesk
bubbles
does
not
possess
the
smell
of
a
stale
tin
car
like
other
macs
a
tad
yeasty
and
sweet
like
sweet
grain
bread
mild
malty
taste
maybe
a
little
sourdough
bread
white
corn
sunflower
seeds
nothing
overwhelming
just
hints
of
these
flavors
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
mild
aftertaste
does
not
have
the
pasty
roof
of
your
mouthfeel
like
other
shitty
macros
suprisingly
the
warmer
it
gets
the
easier
it
is
the
drink
im
not
suggesting
you
let
it
sit
under
your
bed
for
a
week
but
you
can
take
your
time
drinkin
a
sixy
thank
god
for
a
cheap
non
shitty
tasting
beer
for
beer
lovers
that
fell
on
hard
times
d
depends
on
the
situation
if
your
going
out
to
camp
or
hitting
up
a
college
party
pbr
is
my
choice
over
any
mass
produced
might
be
the
cultish
thing
but
it
does
the
job
i
suppose
if
your
a
poor
college
kid
get
a
24
oz
sam
adams
and
some
pbr
and
your
set
eh
why
do
some
establishments
chill
the
hell
out
of
their
mugs
thats
what
i
was
thinking
when
i
received
my
25oz
sample
at
an
ice
cold
temperature
its
still
decent
ice
cold
but
it
tastes
better
at
merely
cold
it
took
time
for
my
sample
to
warm
up
as
the
corn
and
hop
flavors
loosen
up
simple
and
refreshing
beer
without
any
astringent
flavors
drinkability
was
decent
easy
to
pound
down
but
nothing
i
would
relish
having
overall
this
lagers
dryness
and
texture
really
sets
it
apart
from
most
macros
ive
tasted
no
funky
flavors
just
a
nice
tame
character
thats
easy
and
breezy
a
good
nonthinking
beer
try
it
pours
clear
straw
with
sudsy
white
head
which
fades
to
a
thin
layer
in
seconds
spotty
lacing
smell
sweet
grain
slight
corn
and
grainygrassy
hops
taste
lightly
grainy
thin
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
ever
so
slight
touch
of
alcohol
medium
carbonation
fairly
clean
for
a
macro
lager
although
the
cereal
grains
and
corn
syrup
really
hit
in
the
finish
if
it
warms
still
one
of
the
better
american
macro
lagers
around
md
very
good
for
a
cheaper
beer
anyway
back
to
the
beer
pbr
is
just
as
good
as
bmc
plus
its
inexpensive
long
live
pbr
we
live
in
a
great
age
you
can
buy
a
lot
of
beer
for
little
money
forget
buying
a

for

you
can
get
a

pack
for
12
we
can
make
it

can
as
far
as

this
beer
is
like
highlife
in
that
it
has
to
be
cold

in

to
really
be

less
distinctive
than
some
but
still
tastes
fine
the

here
may

this
seems
to
me
to
feel
and
taste
like
a

or
so
lager
if
it
wasnt
for
the

id
insist
it
was
stronger
but
i

they
have
no

taste
is
also
quit
remarkable
for
a

a
slight
sweet

and
hoppiness
on
the

but
unfortunately
this
all
is
spoiled
by
a

aftertaste
it
is
light
bodied
and
carbonation
isnt
out

down
easily
i
think
this
is
a
nicely
done
macro
between
pbr
and

i
might
have
to
go

on

this
is
probably
my
favorite
after
schlitz
actually
has
some
taste
extremely
drinkable
a
nostalgic
choice
for
my
brother
and
i
average
beer
overall
i
fail
to
understand
the
cult
fascination
with
this
brew
its
a
merely
acceptable
macro
not
recommended
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
for
sure
id
certainly
fish
it
out
of
a
bucket
before
id
touch
natural
light
which
i
suppose
can
be
considered
praise
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tall
straightsided
pilsner
glass
the
bottle
has
no
date
clear
pale
yellow
with
12
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
relatively
slowly
while
drinking
leaving
no
lace
light
malt
with
wet
cardboard
aroma
crisp
light
acidic
initial
flavor
that
transitions
into
a
light
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
short
lived
surprisingly
not
bad
relatively
refreshing
it
had
a
slightly
funny
off
flavor
as
it
warmed
light
bodied
with
dry
texture
and
relatively
active
carbonation
i
dont
drink
this
style
very
often
but
i
found
the
pbr
to
be
a
decent
summer
beer
that
pairs
well
with
a
sandwich
or
burger
and
chips
probably
makes
a
good
session
beer
and
is
not
nearly
as
terrible
as
some
beer
snobs
would
have
you
believe
as
said
before
this
is
the
old
standby
better
than
the
macro
brews
done
by
the
same
company
miller
this
is
the
perfect
prepay
day
beer
i
enjoyed
it
in
the
military
in
college
and
now
during
baseball
games
this
is
your
average
beer
for
your
average
guy
i
still
like
it
keeps
me
true
to
my
roots
doesnt
look
like
much
nothing
outstanding
about
it
its
just
beer
plain
and
simple
another
macro
beer
whose
best
feature
is
its
low
price
it
does
go
down
smooth
when
ice
cold
and
its
taste
is
pretty
decent
if
you
are
looking
for
a
cheap
beer
for
a
hot
day
or
just
bumming
around
this
is
a
good
choice
i
will
buy
again
and
would
recommend
for
those
who
enjoy
macros
just
found
a
place
around
here
that
serves
pbr
on
tap
cant
wait
to
try
it
draft
would
not
purchase
but
will
drink
it
if
its
free
folks
this
is
not
to
bad
at
all
some
of
you
may
think
im
crazy
but
it
tastes
like
a
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
that
has
been
toned
down
and
cheapend
a
bit
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
cheap
beer
much
better
than
the
big
three
considering
its
place
in
the
world
of
beer
pbr
aint
that
bad
it
is
my
favorite
of
the
cheap
macros
much
rather
drink
this
than
busch
high
life
or
godforbid
milwaukees
best
its
a
little
sweeter
than
the
others
which
helps
its
drinkability
for
me
helps
overcome
some
of
the
inherent
nastiness
of
this
style
of
beer
prefer
to
get
it
in
the
bottles
which
i
cannot
do
here
in
georgia
but
tennessee
is
just
a
few
miles
away
if
you
need
beer
on
the
cheap
on
a
hot
summer
day
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
than
pbr
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
moneyit
seems
to
get
either
way
too
much
praise
or
gets
relentlessly
slammed
the
truth
lays
somewhere
in
the
middle
this
beer
is
meant
for
drinking
its
very
drinkable
fizzy
overcarbonated
smells
like
creamed
corn
taste
is
corny
but
with
a
sweet
finish
that
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
some
graininess
moderately
refreshing
pretty
crisp
i
doubt
anything
more
has
to
be
said
about
this
ubiquitous
beer
its
good
for
a
macro
but
thats
it
notes
it
all
comes
down
to
price
here
and
for
the
price
this
one
is
pretty
damn
good
its
a
bit
more
than
50
cents
per
can
at
my
local
grocery
store
and
its
worth
every
penny
perfect
on
gamedays
before
going
into
the
stadium
i
would
take
pbr
over
bud
miller
coors
schlitz
milwaukees
best
etc
etc
etc
any
day
the
best
of
the
bad
pbr
still
reigns
after
all
these
years
poured
from
a
can
light
yellow
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
foam
that
fades
aroma
is
sweet
and
grainy
not
far
from
a
macro
lager
taste
is
inoffensive
with
some
bitterness
good
malt
taste
on
tongue
definitely
tastes
better
than
the
last
time
i
had
it
not
too
bad
drank
this
from
a
12
oz
can
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
almost
immediately
can
barely
smell
anything
taste
begins
alright
centers
around
the
malt
but
then
it
drops
out
altogether
no
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
fizzy
but
not
much
else
easily
drinkable
not
altogether
bad
but
theres
just
nothing
much
to
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
refreshing
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
highly
carbonated
white
head
in
the
nose
is
european
hops
and
slightly
skunky
it
tastes
of
a
smooth
sweetness
and
a
small
bitter
end
smooth
dry
end
and
no
aftertaste
i
think
it
might
be
the
hoppiest
of
the
big
5
refreshing
and
i
alway
sing
in
my
head
every
time
i
drink
this
the
beer
that
made
milwaukee
famous
made
a
fool
out
of
me
i
have
often
wondered
what
the
original
formula
tasted
like
when
it
was
actually
brewed
in
milwaukee
not
san
antonio
can
anyone
provide
me
with
this
information
heads
and
shoulders
above
the
big
3
macros
a
fine
brew
for
an
afternoon
thirst
and
goes
along
with
most
foods
just
fine
excellent
at
8am
with
a
reheated
mesquite
grilled
steak
leftover
from
the
night
before
notes
where
i
buy
this
beer
theres
sign
of
pabst
that
says
viva
la
beer
that
makes
me
think
isnt
this
the
most
patriotic
beer
i
dont
think
the
sign
was
a
good
marketing
strategy
drinkability
is
so
so
i
am
not
against
the
idea
of
macro
lagers
some
i
dont
mind
drinking
this
is
one
that
i
would
probably
pass
on
again
not
as
clean
and
refreshing
as
some
of
the
others
in
the
style
in
conclusion
these
beers
have
their
place
in
our
world
god
bless
them
every
one
pour
this
why
the
hell
would
you
its
an
american
classic
that
has
very
little
flavor
a
tiny
hop
bite
in
the
finish
and
is
in
my
opinion
very
smooth
and
poundable
now
like
1630pk
and
was
only
10
the
last
time
i
bought
it
again
6
years
ago
why
the
hell
are
they
raising
the
price
of
this
anyway
id
recommend
it
for
a
cheaper
than
b
m
c
etc
spacer
brew
not
bad
i
remember
seeing
empties
of
these
around
the
house
from
my
dad
when
i
was
little
brings
back
memories
of
the
old
man
he
drank
anything
cheap
but
american
id
go
back
to
this
again
and
sooner
than
6
years
but
i
can
see
that
i
really
didnt
miss
alot
in
those
6
years
of
not
having
pbr
dont
be
too
hard
on
it
though
remember
what
it
is
and
that
it
did
win
a
blue
ribbon
like
over
a
hundred
years
ago
but
it
must
be
the
same
recipe
right
have
a
pbr
if
youre
into
the
macro
lagers
and
im
sure
you
wont
be
disappointed
ciao
for
now
my
beerdrinking
alcoholic
friends
cheers
terrible
absolutely
terrible
the
only
fans
i
know
of
this
beer
like
it
because
its
such
a
joke
the
flavour
has
a
faint
maltiness
thats
mostly
not
present
and
no
lace
its
mouthfeel
is
less
viscous
than
water
the
overcarbonation
stings
the
tongue
and
the
skunkiness
is
unreal
it
was
a
cross
between
rancid
goneoff
cocktail
olives
and
the
aftertaste
of
oral
surgery
i
found
a
sort
of
bitter
aftertaste
that
left
me
far
thirstier
than
a
beer
should
this
beer
has
only
served
any
purpose
after
many
rounds
of
scotch
and
guinness
extra
cold
when
one
is
still
thirsty
but
broke
going
at
3
a
pitcher
fans
of
craft
beers
even
american
macro
should
stay
away
taste
is
a
bit
more
fruitful
not
literally
with
a
more
friendly
malt
seeping
through
mouthfeel
was
thin
to
medium
in
body
with
high
carbonation
appropriate
to
style
and
nonoffensive
this
is
liquid
fritos
even
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
the
frito
aftertaste
i
like
it
better
than
the
big
three
i
still
favor
schlitz
far
more
over
this
brew
but
this
is
still
a
good
choice
if
looking
for
a
hot
summer
day
cheap
throw
back
beer
this
brew
was
the
laughingstock
at
my
graduate
school
department
i
avoided
it
as
long
as
i
could
but
alas
i
did
eventually
try
it
it
was
rank
right
out
of
the
bottle
and
thankfully
it
had
a
more
yellowish
tinge
than
some
other
brews
and
thats
a
very
minor
thankfully
there
is
no
discernable
smell
to
speak
of
nor
is
there
any
discernable
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
with
hints
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
try
again
nor
is
it
a
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
others
pbr
probably
the
best
macro
lager
out
there
pour
is
a
golden
carbonated
average
appearance
white
head
of
a
decent
size
that
fades
somewhat
quickly
smell
is
of
grain
and
malts
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
there
at
least
more
noticeably
so
that
other
macro
lagers
taste
is
much
less
watered
down
and
actually
contains
some
decent
flavor
for
what
is
there
slightly
bitter
hops
and
more
grain
and
malts
somewhat
sweet
mouthfeel
is
light
refreshing
and
because
this
beer
has
flavor
its
much
more
balanced
and
contains
some
substance
drinkability
considering
all
other
aspects
of
this
beer
is
good
thats
hard
to
say
for
most
other
macro
lagers
yet
somehow
i
cant
deny
this
one
a
4
cheap
and
better
than
decent
i
see
why
this
one
still
wins
its
fair
share
of
awards
ok
so
i
was
at
hooters
and
had
to
drink
something
had
never
and
i
mean
that
never
had
a
pbr
so
what
the
hell
was
actually
very
impressed
poured
a
dull
unremarkable
pale
golden
yellow
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
white
fizzy
head
that
faded
immediatly
smell
was
non
descript
and
uneventful
nothing
really
to
discuus
to
here
the
taste
was
actually
quite
pleasent
now
dont
get
me
wrong
it
was
not
complex
and
full
of
flavor
but
for
the
style
it
was
superb
light
corngrain
taste
but
mostly
fizzy
water
very
smooth
and
well
carbonated
and
easily
poundable
all
night
long
i
would
have
to
say
hands
down
thi
is
the
best
macro
lager
i
have
ever
had
not
that
that
is
saying
alot
but
this
was
nnot
actually
that
bad
with
some
wings
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
its
all
right
for
an
inexpensive
beer
but
there
are
certainly
much
better
beers
out
there
even
within
the
style
i
might
just
stock
up
on
this
myself
next
time
i
shop
for
beer
d
very
drinkable
and
better
tasting
imho
than
most
other
macros
out
there
also
considerably
cheaper
30
cans
for
10
99
as
opposed
for
13
99
for
24
cans
of
bud
or
miller
always
will
be
my
first
choice
for
cheap
macros
ok
so
im
reviewing
pbr
but
i
must
say
its
really
good
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
lets
drink
a
bunch
dont
give
a
care
beer
its
like
saying
airplane
and
gone
with
the
wind
or
whatever
oscar
winning
movie
are
both
great
movies
its
good
for
what
it
represents
onto
the
review
i
poured
one
from
a
can
drank
the
rest
of
them
from
the
can
and
it
actually
had
a
really
big
head
it
dissipated
rather
quickly
verry
yellow
golden
typical
of
this
kind
of
beer
the
beer
had
little
aroma
but
had
decent
body
and
taste
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
and
they
can
go
down
rather
quickly
much
better
than
the
other
mass
produced
swill
that
dominates
sales
people
laugh
at
it
but
this
is
a
classic
american
brew
that
is
good
for
what
it
represents
its
obviously
not
complex
but
on
the
other
hand
i
wouldnt
detest
drinking
the
smell
is
neutral
an
inoffensive
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
strong
hints
of
corn
syrup
and
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
probably
the
only
macro
lager
with
hops
flavors
that
i
can
detect
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
too
carbonated
and
sweet
i
found
myself
unable
to
down
larger
gulps
of
this
one
as
it
was
powerful
in
my
throat
and
this
is
not
a
good
thing
i

it
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
head
about
2inches
think
and
fluffy
that
quickly
dies
though
smell
was
corn
and
believe
it
or
not
a
hint
of
floral
hops
in
there
as
well
this
was
surprising
the
taste
was
very
weak
i
couldnt
find
anything
more
than
corn
it
was
an
easy
drink
since
there
was
really
nothing
to
focus
on
hochfliegenmar

drink
it
cold
drink
it
fast
and
in
case
you
were
wondering
this
bottle
had
a
two
of
clubs
d
lets
face
it
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
the
weak
taste
makes
it
an
easy
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
especially
if
a
berlinerweiss
isnt
available
a
fairly
refreshing
brew
when
chilled
and
a
great
beer
for
cooking
and
eating
since
it
doesnt
hit
the
tastebuds
hard
if
at
all
as
a
macro
american
brew
it
is
an
example
of
the
style
that
sits
above
the
others
mouthfeel
drinkabilty
the
beer
is
thin
almost
watery
the
carbonation
is
in
porportion
to
the
beer
and
makes
it
easier
to
drink
this
is
a
classic
lawnmower
beer
that
has
just
found
its
way
back
into
my
beer
mix
pale
light
strawcolored
with
virtually
no
head
shades
of
carbonation
a
sweet
grassy
smell
and
taste
complexity
is
the
last
thing
this
offers
which
leads
to
a
subtle
smoothness
not
the
most
highly
pleasant
sour
aftertaste
remains
in
the
mouth
which
is
a
strange
blend
between
that
and
the
carbonation
limp
puny
yellow
you
can
see
the
carbonation
meager
white
head
smells
a
little
off
and
gets
worse
as
the
beer
warms
not
a
good
testament
to
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
some
slight
malt
smells
yeast
grassy
hops
overly
ripe
corn
tastes
like
harsh
grains
a
bit
too
much
sugar
and
a
slight
hop
kick
more
so
than
in
the
other
common
place
macro
lagers
drink
it
cold
drink
it
fast
i
would
have
to
give
the
pbr
the
slight
edge
here
very
slight
though
it
might
be
not
the
best
beer
but
passible
on
my
scale
but
hey
you
cant
beat
a
pitcher
on
draft
for
four
bucks
on
a
friday
night
the
best
bang
for
the
buck
as
far
as
marcos
go
drank
a
lot
of
these
beers
in
the
days
never
turn
one
of
these
down
go
pbr
a
classic
macro
overall
not
a
bad
beer
when
options
are
limited
very
crisp
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
incredibly
thin
but
it
is
smooth
refreshing
and
definitely
not
filling
this
beer
doesnt
pretend
to
be
anything
its
not
and
it
is
damned
good
considering
its
counterparts
definitely
not
one
of
my
first
choices
but
i
have
yet
to
find
anything
that
goes
quite
as
well
on
a
100
summer
day
or
with
a
pizza
especially
considering
the
price
that
being
said
you
will
rarely
find
my
fridge
without
at
least
a
6pack
of
pbr
d
this
has
always
been
my
macro
of
choice
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
one
of
the
palest
i
have
seen
low
aromasort
of
just
says
beer
rather
bland
and
unimpressive
flavorlacks
the
crisp
snap
that
i
find
in
a
bud
and
others
very
1
dimensional
thin
and
watery
body
as
i
said
i
love
a
good
macrotheres
a
place
and
time
for
them
in
my
book
i
think
i
would
grab
a
strohs
or
old
milwaukee
first
poured
a
clear
straw
color
a
bit
yellow
had
a
decent
whispy
white
head
that
dissipated
as
i
poured
it
and
left
no
lacing
the
smell
is
of
corn
grainy
a
bit
of
sulfer
the
taste
is
better
it
has
a
some
sweet
malt
notes
to
it
not
too
artficially
sweet
like
other
macros
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
nicely
carbonated
another
good
cooler
beer
and
this
doesnt
have
that
ick
taste
that
other
macros
have
which
makes
it
quite
drinkable
sometimes
you
just
need
to
slum
a
little
and
when
in
portland
or
this
is
the
way
to
go
its
pours
pretty
yellow
and
normally
that
scares
me
but
it
sort
of
works
not
much
for
a
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
rather
standard
for
an
american
macro
lager
but
their
not
unpleasant
a
bit
bland
and
not
too
much
of
an
aftertaste
it
has
be
be
cold
though
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
after
a
couple
pints
of
the
good
stuff
this
can
maintain
a
pretty
good
buzz
for
hours
im
still
note
sure
why
a
texan
beer
is
so
popular
in
portland
what
with
all
the
craft
breweries
there
and
it
just
doesnt
drink
the
same
anywhere
else
for
me
i
was
rather
suprised
when
i
had
prb
for
the
first
time
with
an
open
mind
the
fundamental
features
of
it
were
pretty
poor
such
as
no
retention
no
head
no
lace
no
smell
the
look
was
a
light
coppery
color
not
that
bad
looking
the
taste
was
a
bit
spicy
with
a
hint
of
malts
and
hops
well
blended
together
a
very
solid
draft
brew
dont
drink
and
review
it
pours
very
nicely
into
my
beer
clean
glass
with
abundant
head
a
very
faint
yellow
color
but
thats
where
my
pleasant
trip
down
memory
lane
ends
aroma
is
bad
smells
like
malted
corn
and
not
in
a
good
way
flavor
is
more
appealing
with
some
maltiness
and
corn
taste
which
is
much
less
potent
than
the
odor
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
i
wouldnt
call
this
very
drinkable
its
a
punk
rock
beer
and
its
cooler
to
order
a
pbr
than
a
coors
light
but
dont
expect
to
get
much
more
flavor
or
satisfaction
i
can
appreciate
why
people
like
it
but
it
seems
like
a
waste
of
timemoney
to
ever
drink
this
stuff
when
there
is
so
much
better
out
there
it
serves
a
purpose
for
the
financially
struggling
college
kids
and
rock
wannabes
but
id
rather
have
one
or
two
good
beers
than
a
sixpack
of
swill
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
cheap
to
buy
i
like
this
beer
to
drink
when
im
playing
cards
with
the
guys
for
taste
it
is
some
bitterness
but
not
bad
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
not
grainy
or
anything
like
that
smells
like
beer
nothing
fancy
there
all
in
all
its
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
looks
like
beer
smells
like
beer
nothing
special
there
tastes
better
than
any
of
the
big
boy
beers
bud
coors
miller
etc
and
is
usually
cheaper
to
boot
i
would
not
go
around
preaching
its
virtues
but
a
great
beer
for
playing
drinking
games
as
it
is
easy
to
pound
and
does
not
leave
me
felling
like
a
2

doing
so
quite
pale
and
transparant
piss
yellow
clear

is
minimal
nice
nose
on
this
beer
for
the

also

hay

find

overall
this
beer

each
other
it
is
what
it
is
an
american
macro
lager

again
you
pay

always
in

for

off
i
can
really
appreciate
the
way
this

tastes
it
has
very
little
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
or
any
flavor
at
all
for
that
matter
but
there
is
also
very
little
about

not

this

my
favorite
cheap
beer
especially
after
a
long
day
of
work
if
the
corny
aftertaste
wasnt
there
it
would
be
exceptional
for
the
price
pabst
blue
ribbon
was
pale
golgen
in
color
and
very
clear
it
had
a
thick
bubbly
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
grainy
the
taste
was
about
the
same
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
dry
finish
it
had
a
mediumlight
body
and
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
its
not
to
bad
for
a
macro
lager
d
designed
to
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
and
very
appropriate
for
doing
so
not
bad
for
how
cheap
it
is
not
bad
at
all
i
know
what
the
fuss
is
about
current
hipness
of
retroblue
collar
posturing
but
i
just
dont
know
what
the
fuss
is
about
ive
had
this
one
in
the
12
oz
can
the
12
oz
bottle
on
draught
in
a
24
oz
can
and
in
the
40
oz
i
watch
people
pay
three
dollars
a
can
for
this
in
an
affluent
neighborhood
bar
that
has
fifteen
good
taps
i
presume
they
are
making
their
ironic
social
statement
though
the
true
irony
eludes
them
ok
so
its
thin
bodied
with
a
weird
offputting
fruity
cheap
cereal
flavor
the
finish
makes
me
want
to
drink
a
glass
of
water
and
eat
a
handful
of
pretzel
nuggets
before
switching
to
something
better
is
there
a
time
and
place
for
this
yes
but
not
here
not
now
a
beer
for
the
long
haul
even
light
weights
find
this
beer
in
their
hand
no
less
than
10
times
in
an
evening
not
the
best
macro
lager
ive
ever
had
but
its
a
damn
good
one
in
my
opinion
very
pale
yellow
body
with
about
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
malty
with
a
hint
of
hop
tastes
sweet
and
watery
not
really
noticing
any
hops
here
reminds
me
in
some
ways
of
molson
ice
in
its
flavor
becomes
somewhat
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
but
still
fairly
watery
very
drinkable
though
and
very
cheap
i
would
say
this
beats
anything

makes
it
now
im
sure
its
better
on
tap
than
from
the
16
oz
can
im
drinking
looks
and
smells
like
cheap
beer
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
out
of
the
park
this
is
some
good
tasting
stuff
and
highly
drinkable
for
the
910
a
24
pack
pbr
me
can
poured
a
very
light
yellow
color
beer
with
a
medium
white
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
corn
and
adjunct
is
not
surprisingly
dominating
taste
is
as
bland
as
it
can
be
done
with
no
aftertaste
at
all
which
is
probably
the
purpose
but
does
not
provide
me
with
any
satisfaction
for
a
very
cheap
macro
it
could
be
much
worse
i
had
a
few
of
these
at
the
pool
in
the
heat
on
sunday
and
found
that
i
felt
more
like
i
was
drinking
beer
than
if
i
had
many
the
big
more
expensive
macros
if
you
are
in
a
place
that
allows
only
cans
you
can
do
worse
especially
for
the
price
the
color
is
almost
clear
little
to
no
body
foamy
head
that
reminds
me
of
the
foam
youd
see
on
a
questionable
lake
the
color
of
urine
when
you
are
close
to
hydrated
smell
of
metal
a
tinge
skunky
no
real
hops
or
barley
character
taste
is
subtle
with
little
to
no
complexity
taste
of
metal
mild
yeast
a
little
sour
thin
no
alcohol
warmth
really
this
is
not
a
good
beer
but
out
of
the
macros
id
rather
drink
it
than
bud
or
any
other
cheep
completely
quantitative
beers
maybe
simply
for
old
times
sake
but
likely
not
i
could
imagine
wanting
one
of
these
after
along
day
of
work
or
mowing
the
lawn
or
something
we
had
a
saying
when
i
was
in
college
4
rebate
you
cant
afford
not
to
drink
it
this
is
a
classic
macro
that
has
enjoyed
quite
a
resurgence
in
the
market
at
least
in
the
southeast
while
in
college
the
only
place
one
could
find
pbr
was
at
either
sketchy
roadhouses
or
frat
houses
when
money
was
low
now
its
at
practically
every
beer
bar
out
there
pabst
among
others
has
really
stepped
up
their
marketing
and
many
classic
macros
have
a
much
larger
presence
now
e
g
miller
high
life
and
even
schlitz
pbr
is
beer
that
brings
back
nostalgia
as
i
drank
it
regularly
in
college
it
has
more
flavor
and
body
than
most
macros
and
is
very
easy
drinking
i
just
enjoyed
3
of
them
for
2
each
genes
haufbrau
in
charleston
s
c
when
moneys
low
pbr
is
always
a
decent
alternative
fyi
it
was
pabst
who
originally
invented
the
6
pack
i
got
pbr
because
i
heard
that
it
might
be
a
decent
macro
brew
well
it
is
it
pours
extremely
pale
with
a
frothy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
i
can
smell
corn
before
even
puting
might
nose
near
the
glass
but
this
subsides
into
a
flowery
sweet
aroma
it
tastes
almost
as
light
as
it
looks
and
leaves
light
sweet
taste
on
the
toungue
imminently
refreshing
this
is
with
a
drinkability
that
would
embarass
any
other
beer
i
can
think
of
and
whats
more
its
cheap
as
hell
apparently
its
a
classic
though
i
would
never
know
this
gets
a
five
for
drinkabilty
for
the
ease
with
which
it
is
drunk
and
for
the
ease
with
which
it
is
purchased
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
pretty
much
no
head
poured
from
a
can
into
a
mug
average
macro
lager
smell
to
it
with
a
hint
of
corn
the
taste
matches
the
smell
a
typical
macro
lager
with
a
hint
of
corn
has
a
slightly
sour
taste
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
making
it
nice
light
and
crisp
feels
very
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
good
for
a
cheap
beer
very
good
for
the
style
eric
this
beer
pours
a
very
pale
golden
with
no
more
head
then
you
would
get
from
soda
by
the
time
i
has
poured
out
the
whole
beer
there
was
absolutely
no
head
not
very
impressive
smell
with
a
sour
wheat
quality
it
has
a
light
hops
taste
with
not
much
of
an
after
taste
it
has
a
slightly
heavy
feel
with
a
little
bit
of
a
sudsy
texture
over
all
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
taste
but
it
doesnt
have
a
bad
taste
if
you
looking
for
a
smooth
beer
thats
really
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
good
one
pale
golden
body
that
crystal
clear
and
constant
carbonation
rising
it
looks
like
any
other
american
macro
lager
the
smell
and
taste
are
nothing
to
special
either
the
both
are
filled
with
corny
adjuncts
the
mouthfeel
is
paper
thin
and
it
goes
down
like
water
not
the
worse
beer
ive
had
but
not
the
best
by
a
long
shot
this
is
a
solid
affordable
beer
a
bit
boring
compared
to
other
lagers
with
corn
hops
but
still
respectable
went
to
pick
up
some
beers
to
take
to
the
lake
and
finally
took
up
the
recommendation
from
kmpitz2
and
purchased
a
sixer
for
the
trip
the
good
thing
about
the
beer
is
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
the
look
is
a
crystal
clear
and
hightly
carbonated
canary
yellow
could
have
better
head
retetion
the
flavors
are
grain
adjuncts
and
vegetablelike
nice
tones
of
green
apples
and
a
light
lemonzest
very
light
and
playful
in
the
body
with
a
very
clean
finish
a
little
dry
and
a
little
watery
but
it
is
to
be
expected
though
there
are
no
real
standout
characters
the
flaws
are
what
youd
expect
for
the
style
not
bad
stuff
it
has
a
decent
taste
and
its
very
drinkable
slightly
sour
of
course
but
its
better
than
you
might
expect
also
its
generally
cheaper
at
the
bars
if
youre
needing
cheap
beer
try
this
over
your
usual
bud
miller
coors
varieties
actually
this
is
a
little
icky
i
think
ill
avoid
it
in
the
future
definitely
one
of
the
best
american
macros
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
at
all
and
much
better
than
90
of
bmc
offerings
give
this
one
a
try
extremely
pale
straw
color
topped
with
some
white
head
that
quickly
disappers
sweet
smell
of
white
bread
sweet
corn
and
college
very
simple
and
bland
tastes
nothing
stands
out
as
good
but
nothing
stands
out
as
offensive
either
mostly
a
sweet
corny
malt
flavor
no
hop
taste
but
they
must
be
there
because
it
finishes
pretty
clean
very
bubbly
and
light
easy
and
fun
to
drink
because
of
all
the
memories
not
great
but
the
price
is
right
for
a
big
night
of
drinking
frank
booth
heineken
fuck
that
shit
pabst
blue
ribbon
both
strohs
and
pbr
have
come
through
with
flying
colors
in
the
tenth
iteration
of
the
macsmack
series
its
a
shame
that
there
has
to
be
a
loser
by
virtue
of
its
superior
head
and
slightly
creamier
mouthfeel
pabst
blue
ribbon
takes
the
muchcoveted
crown
really
though
either
one
of
these
venerable
american
beers
would
be
a
good
choice
for
reliving
the
good
old
days
of
ones
youth
ah
yes
the
good
old
pbr
its
been
quite
the
staple
of
my
college
life
always
finding
its
time
honored
place
in
our
refrigerator
its
a
good
beer
for
a
nice
cold
shower
after
a
day
in
the
muggy
new
orleans
summer
heat
however
this
is
by
no
means
a
good
beer
i
do
prefer
a
pabst
blue
ribbon
over
any
budmiller
product
any
day
but
this
is
only
when
im
too
broke
to
get
a
quality
craft
brew
after
having
an
assortment
of
abita
and
sierra
nevada
kegs
over
the
last
month
or
so
we
got
a
little
pour
and
decided
to
toss
in
a
59
keg
of
pbr
into
the
kegerator
the
pbr
pours
a
light
pale
yellow
and
has
a
repulsive
smell
after
a
night
of
drinking
i
woke
up
to
find
some
beer
stains
on
my
shirt
which
were
emitting
quite
a
repulsive
odor
however
the
beer
does
go
down
smooth
and
is
very
very
easy
to
drink
pbr
not
the
best
of
beers
but
maybe
one
of
the
best
of
the
cheap
domestics
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
very
little
head
smell
has
a
faint
grassy
aroma
taste
likewise
has
a
faint
malt
presence
a
very
light
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
creamy
not
bad
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
during
a
round
of
golf
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
better
than
bud
it
is
however
fairly
cheap
and
a
throwback
to
what
i
used
to
think
beer
tasted
like
as
a
kid
recommended
not
really
but
you
can
do
far
worse
i
wont
waste
any
time
with
how
it
pours
how
it
looks
how
it
smells
on
those
counts
it
is
exactly
like
any
american
macro
out
there
at
6
a
12pack
bottles
or
cans
there
is
a
simple
way
to
review
this
beer
it
is
way
above
average
for
what
it
is
for
an
american
macro
on
the
cheap
it
has
flavor
and
there
is
nothing
offending
about
it
it
is
better
than
most
american
macros
out
there
and
even
those
pushing
twice
the
price
for
whatever
reason
i
find
the
beer
out
of
a
can
better
than
the
bottle
a
good
lawnmower
beer
if
you
can
find
schlitz
i
would
go
for
it
instead
but
if
not
pabst
is
a
good
choice
cheers
overall
its
one
of
those
cheaper
beers
worth
getting
over
miller
light
milwakee
and
all
for
cheap
beers
id
prefer
shlitz
anyday
but
i
know
a
lot
of
people
loving
this
good
for
them
i
feel
guilty
giving
scores
this
high
to
an
american
macro
but
judging
by
style
im
probably
marking
it
low
drinkability
below
average
drinkability
there
are
better
macros
out
there
but
its
drinkable
when
it
comes
to
macros
drinkability
easy
to
drink
not
offensive
as
it
is
mostly
concieved
great
beer
for
social
gatherings
i
will
keep
this
one
as
my
session
beer
it
was
better
than
i
expected
somehow
i
had
never
had
pbr
while
i
was
a
poorcollege
student
beer
guzzler
i
had
to
try
it
and
see
how
it
tasted
i
cant
listen
to
someone
tell
me
that
this
beer
tastes
so
much
better
than
other
macros
what
is
the
deal
here
heres
what
this
beer
has
going
for
it
it
is
not
as
repulsive
as
natty
light
but
is
just
as
cheap
itll
get
you
drunk
and
can
wash
down
food
pours
the
typical
light
yellow
with
the
quickly
disipating
head
no
surprises
smell
is
really
grainy
with
a
hint
of
booze
surprising
for
the
low
abv
really
pleasant
and
not
too
sweet
in
the
taste
kind
of
drying
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
doesnt
suffer
from
the
typical
prickliness
of
excess
carbonation
this
is
really
good
if
you
want
to
drink
at
homeat
the
bar
on
the
cheap
and
makes
a
good
summertime
refreshment
light
yellow
color
the
head
is
very
large
initially
and
retains
fairly
well
considering
its
a
macro
unbelievably
disgusting
oceanic
aroma
sea
water
salt
seaweed
along
with
light
grains
and
corn
watery
corny
flavor
with
hints
of
light
grains
and
sauvignon
blanc
terrifying
i
forgot
to
note
the
cool
poker
caps
the
bottle
caps
have
card
values
on
the
inside
so
you
can
play
games
like
poker
and
blackjack
pit
your
caps
against
everyone
elses
and
the
loser
pays
had
this
at
the
showplace
theatre
in
buffalo
ny
for
2
bucks
a
pop
this
is
a
whole
nother
beast
on
tap
the
beer
was
an
average
looking
american
macro
gold
with
a
very
small
faom
cap
the
aroma
was
really
sweet
and
grainy
very
clean
and
inoffensive
when
compared
to
bud
or
miller
taste
is
actually
kinda
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
moderate
very
smooth
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
espcially
when
you
compare
the
tap
version
to
the
bottle
or
can
this
is
much
sweeter
and
smooth
on
tap
if
this
is
on
tap
with
the
other
standard
crap
i
will
have
to
go
with
this
drinkabitly
is
ok
leaving
me
in
a
search
for
the
perfect
summer
quencher
pours
a
light
golden
fluffy
head
quickly
disappears
not
much
lacebut
lots
of
bubbles
smell
is
of
light
malt
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hop
this
beer
is
by
no
means
offensiveand
its
cheep
im
sure
thats
why
the
college
kids
love
it
verdict
solid
canned
lager
nothing
great
but
it
quenches
the
thirst
in
a
reasonably
satisfying
manner
seeing
the
4
7
abv
proves
to
me
why
this
is
so
popular
among
the
young
trendy
and
closetobroke
theres
no
introspection
here
no
depth
no
notes
nothing
hidden
or
worth
finding
on
the
2nd
or
3rd
tasting
its
a
blue
collar
brew
that
does
its
job
and
nothing
more
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
oh
right
nostalgia
yawn
this
is
a
nice
macro
lager
nothing
offensive
about
it
just
a
nice
clean
crisp
flavor
that
is
able
to
avoid
the
just
took
a
breath
of
wet
air
finish
that
comes
from
some
macros
best
served
quite
cold
as
a
refreshing
beverage
after
hard
work
on
a
hot
day
it
also
doesnt
seem
to
lose
too
much
when
drunk
from
the
can
so
its
great
to
take
camping
or
fishing
really
not
a
bad
beer
and
pretty
good
by
macro
standards
id
prefer
high
life
or
schlitz
but
would
do
nicely
in
a
pinch
a
pabst
blue
ribbon
can
be
a
refreshing
beer
under
the
right
circumstances
iy
pours
a
clear
lihky
golden
color
into
the
glass
the
head
is
nice
and
foamy
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
an
bar
you
have
been
into
it
makes
your
think
of
stale
beer
and
sloppy
floors
the
taste
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
this
is
not
necessarily
an
achievement
considering
the
absence
of
flavor
to
begin
with
not
the
macro
lage
i
would
reach
for
again
dont
get
got
up
in
the
fad
i
would
recommend
a
miller
high
life
instead
pours
a
clear
straw
sort
of
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
leaving
no
lace
bubbles
flying
up
from
the
bottom
mostly
a
grain
smell
pretty
clean
with
a
hint
of
floralness
grainy
in
taste
but
not
in
a
bad
way
a
little
bit
of
corn
and
only
a
touch
of
hops
taste
almost
dances
on
your
tongue
with
the
amount
of
carbonation
i
imagine
this
as
a
great
beer
with
many
different
foods
higher
carbonation
but
seems
to
be
a
nice
addition
to
this
one
light
to
medium
body
i
expected
very
light
body
but
having
a
little
something
there
is
nice
i
usually
dont
save
any
room
for
macros
in
my
fridge
but
i
may
be
able
to
squeeze
a
little
room
for
this
seems
like
this
would
be
good
for
many
occasions
bbq

simple
pbr
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
one
inch
head
that
went
away
rather
quickly
aroma
was
citrusy
and
fruity
with
a
faint
whiff
of
corn
taste
was
very
fruity
and
spritzy
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
and
some
malt
character
in
the
finish
but
not
much
this
beer
had
an
incredibly
thin
mouthfeel
it
was
pretty
bland
and
watery
tasting
which
is
the
standard
for
most
macros
i
guess
i
could
see
this
as
a
refreshing
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
in
90
degree
temperatures
notes
im
in
pabst
and
budweiser
are
the
two
macros
that
see
time
in
my
fridge
they
know
how
to
make
a
fairly
tasteless
beer
without
any
edges
or
something
to
possibly
send
you
to
another
brand
it
is
what
it
is
a
cheap
brew
that
doesnt
offend
with
other
options
on
the
grocery
shelfnamely
miller
high
life
and
milwaukee

lightthe
low
price
is
not
even
a
saving
grace
some
people
get
used
to
the
taste
from
buying
the
cheap
beer
on
the
shelf
but
i
honestly
cant
support
anyone
even
tasting
this
beer
so
i
was
at
a
bar
and
didnt
feel
like
anything
but
a
thirst
quencher
and
as
id
never
had
pbr
i
thought
id
give
it
a
go
not
expecting
anything
except
a
cool
boring
liquid
well
it
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
surprisingly
long
lasting
head
really
little
smell
to
it
just
a
thin
grassy
grainy
malt
good
medium
body
and
nice
carbonation
up
front
with
a
grainy
malt
through
the
middle
and
if
i
remember
a
slightly
bitter
ending
basically
pour
this
and
dont
give
me
the
name
and
id
mistake
it
as
a
micro
maybe
pretty
drinkable
beer
though
a
real
thirst
quencher
this
beer
is
actually
tasty
on
tap
the
taste
and
smell
are
about
the
same
as
from
the
can
but
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
quite
a
bit
superior
it
feels
fuller
and
smoother
the
head
on
the
beer
is
also
creamier
and
softer
good
choice
for
a
cheaper
keg
at
a
party
the
lessharsh
carbonation
also
makes
this
more
drinkable
as
far
as
american
macro
lagers
go
this
is
up
there
musings
along
with
schlitz
my
macro
of
choice
for
the
pounding
sessions
i
dont
find
the
flavor
of
the
pbr
as
noticeably
sweet
as
the
other
macros
i
like
it
from
the
can
and
not
the
bottle
this
is
one
of
the
best
mass
produced
beers
i
have
run
across
i
prefer
it
to
many
of
the
others
in
its
class
i
feel
it
packs
more
flavor
and
color
then
many
of
its
competitors
it
pours
a
nice
yellow
and
has
a
faint
citrus
taste
to
go
along
with
it
clear
to
watery
and
brownish
corny
malt
odor
is
weak
and
watery
smelling
taste
is
ok
for
its
type
regular
old
macro
flavor
sweet
grassy
corny
some
malt
taste
evident
kind
of
watery
but
pretty
drinkable
overall
tastes
like
daves
party
pants
this
beer
pours
a
very
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
is
sort
of
fruity
or
grainy
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
up
front
but
not
cloying
definitely
a
good
choice
if
youre
going
macro
clean
crisp
taste
not
bad
compared
to
the
competition
listenthis
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
is
the
best
of
its
breed
american
macro
lagers
are
expected
to
be
lightcolored
and
virtually
flavorless
with
littletono
hop
aroma
and
this
divebar
classic
does
it
without
making
you
feel
like
youre
drinking
a
mensroom
special
the
body
is
slightly
more
full
more
maltdriven
than
your
bud
or
miller
varieties
and
it
delivers
a
surprisingly
complex
albeit
slight
clean
almostcitrus
like
finsh
that
at
least
gives
you
some
indication
that
youve
just
taken
a
sip
of
something
other
than
water
add
in
the
nostalgia
factor
which
is
no
small
part
and
youre
looking
at
a
classic
american
brew
that
definitely
has
a
time
and
a
place
to
be
enjoyed
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
my
friends
dont
let
retro
lovers
convince
you
that
this
is
a
good
beer
sure
it
may
be
cleaner
tasting
than
bud
but
it
is
still
a
macro
adjunct
lager
so
speaking
of
adjuncts
aroma
is
of
sour
corn
mash
and
yeast
pours
a
nice
golden
color
brilliant
to
the
light
for
a
macro
nice
amount
of
hops
bitterness
zero
hop
aroma
fairly
light
bodied
for
a
non
light
beer
very
bright
clear
yellow
watery
thin
and
no
hop
aroma
nor
much
malt
either
very
grainy
in
aroma
and
in
flavor
yet
this
grain
isnt
real
strong
so
you
can
power
tons
of
this
stuff
it
is
difficult
to
write
two
hundred
and
fifty
characters
to
describe
a
beer
that
has
nothing
really
going
on
other
than
the
fact
it
makes
you
pee
and
make
you
look
studly
because
you
cam
power
a
case
and
still
operate
a
lawn
mower
hence
the
name
lawnmower
beer
88
cents
for
a
pint
can
not
bad
price
for
macro
stuff
pours
a
piss
yellow
smells
quite
grainy
and
sweet
tastes
sweet
with
an
unusual
citrusy
flavor
but
its
kind
of
weak
mouthfeel
is
watery
as
normal
for
macros
ive
had
very
drinkable
as
this
is
supposed
to
be
for
a
mass
market
it
wont
win
any
awards
except
best
in
redneck
category
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
about
average
for
a
macro
lager
it
smells
grainy
not
much
more
than
that
tastes
similar
to
the
smell
a
mild
grainy
maltiness
with
a
small
but
noticable
amount
of
hops
pbr
goes
down
easy
enough
and
at
48
for
a
12
barrel
its
the
perfect
beer
for
a
college
party
i
would
still
take
it
over
most
macros
given
the
choice
at
the
bar
where
i
reviewed
this
the
pbr
was
three
bucks
a
pitcher
hence
the
reason
i
drank
it
though
i
do
usually
get
a
bad
hangover
after
drinking
alot
of
this
stuff
i
still
consider
it
my
favorite
macro
oh
boy
what
can
i
say
basic
yellow
color
no
head
to
speak
of
smells
and
tastes
like
cheap
malt
with
almost
zero
hops
mouthfeel
is
kinda
crisp
but
not
really
why
did
i
bother
to
review
it
ill
tell
you
why
i
drink
it
almost
every
sunday
for
a
buck
served
from
the
tap
in
a
pbr
goblet
no
less
which
i
find
totally
hysterical
with
my
chicken
dinner
at
the
tavern
and
despite
the
fact
that
it
sucks
i
enjoy
it
every
time
d
mild
flavor
easy
to
drink
absurdly
easy
to
session
i
would
pick
other
beers
over
pbr
for
food
choices
though
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
almost
always
drank
out
of
the
can
and
sometimes
the
bottle
the
appearance
is
a
slightly
slightly
darker
straw
color
the
head
is
there
for
a
second
and
quickly
turns
into
a
collar
if
you
pour
agressively
its
usually
a
bit
impressive
looking
the
smell
is
just
normal
apa
beer
which
is
still
good
to
me
as
a
smell
thats
what
were
going
for
here
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
dull
malts
with
a
slightly
crisp
hop
finish
still
good
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
drinkability
is
quite
good
as
long
as
you
dont
get
tired
of
it
and
want
something
highbrow
not
my
fantasy
island
beer
but
if
i
had
to
drink
this
i
wouldnt
complain
overall
what
can
i
say
its
a
macro
and
cheap
and
not
very
good
one
could
probably
easily
chug
a
whole
bunch
of
these
there
would
be
no
true
beer
appreciation
though
next
time
someone
offers
ill
pass
the
drinkinkability
is
quite
good
considering
all
of
the
above
it
does
quench
some
thirst
believe
me
will
i
buy
this
beer
again
well
hopefully
itll
be
just
as
cheap
as
last
time
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
based
on
what
it
is
definately
better
than
anything
spat
out
by
the
big
3
and
for
those
who
want
to
turn
their
nose
up
at
you
for
drinking
an
old
mans
beer
especially
during
a
red
sox
game
while
eating
peanuts
not
cashews
but
the
better
kind
of
macro
standard
at
least
head
is
thin
bitter
finish
its
clearly
a
macro
but
not
in
a
bad
way
more
like
a
comfortable
old
pair
of
shoes
if
you
dont
know
what
this
is

no

smell
is
sweet
and
honeylike
hot
days
beer
but
this
vanishes
upon
the
swallow
to
leave
and
empty
space
in
the
flavor
despite
this
even
after
letting
it
warm
up
a
bit
i
find
pbr
to
have
a
slightly
better
taste
which
is
more
enjoyable
than
say
pa
pours
the
standard
macro
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
goes
away
i
was
surprised
by
how
little
carbonation
there
was
and
no
lacing
to
speak
off
smells
like
corn
to
me
and
i
find
it
to
have
a
nice
sweet
taste
goes
well
with
bratwurst
some
hops

basic
homebrew
sweet
at

maybe
because
of
the
beer
snobbery
that
has
taken
over

thats
too
bad
because
this
one
can
get
a
bad
rap
since
its
the
chaepest
beer
around
and
its
the
beer
many
of
our
fathers
drank
not
too
bad
typical
macro
and
now
i
am
out
of
college
and
having
to
pinch
every
penny
and
muted
hops
bitterness
tastes
like

its

since

for

on
no

the

what
a

i
would
prefer
this
one
over
ab
and
if
i
found
myself
in
a
dive
that
was
classy
enough
to
stock
this
one
and
definitely
dont
have
the
money
for
something
good
otherwise
this
one
takes
home
a
prize
for
having
a

of

no

its

52at
first
i
was
somewhat
surprised
that
this
beer
seemed
drinkable
i
wasnt
expecting
much
grain
and
hops
are
more
apparent
the
overall
strong
point
of
the
taste
is
a
grainy
sweetness
this
is
very
drinkable
and
well
worth
the
very
low
price
for
a
12
pack
hands
down
this
is
my
money
saver
beer
choice
gagnonsuxfeb
01
crisp
taste
which
is
eventually
followed
by
an
very
abstract
aftertaste
that
i
have
never
found
the
words
to
describe
overall
it
really
does
have
a
prized
flavor
when
in
the
company
of
macrobrews
captain
pabst
is
my
hero
brownbottlehalljan
01
im
not
much
of
a
macro
drinker
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
drinkable
it
also
didnt
have
the
typical
chemical
flavor
i
find
in
other
macros
id
probably
get
another
pabst
if
i
was
in
a
place
that
had
this
as
the
best
selection
you
are
incredibly
drinkable
mr
pabst
that
i
cannot
ignore
and
your
taste
well
lets
just
say
its
heads
and
tails
above
the
other
beers
of
your
ilk
grainy
and
bready
with
hints
of
weeds
it
serves
to
wash
down
just
about
any
food
quite
well
you
have
a
nice
head
too
all
big
and
foamy
im
posting
this
one
because
pbr
in
a
bottle
is
noticably
different
from
pbr
in
a
can
its
your
usual
fizzy
yellow
beer
appearance
head
is
quickly
gone
usual
macro
smell
however
i
give
this
beer
the
distinction
of
the
only
macro
ive
ever
tasted
hops
in
its
not
like
im
even
drinking
a
decent
ipa
but
the
hops
are
there
in
the
middle
and
the
finish
not
bad
not
great
but
ill
choose
it
over
any
macro
and
quite
a
few
crappy
micros
mmmmm
pbr
the
best
beer
in
america
as
voted
in
1893
when
it
was
probably
in
competition
against
one
other
beer
gold
color
with
a
slight
head
that
even
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
wowwww
the
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
but
damnit
it
tastes
just
fine
and
you
can
drink
it
til
the
cows
come
home
by
far
my
favorite
of
any
cheap
beer
out
there
we
will
make
this
world
a
better
place
one
pabst
at
a
time
pours
a
simple
light
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
and
no
lcaing
whatsoever
smells
like
a
decent
macrolager
but
nothing
special
tastes
like
water
with
a
pinch
of
grain
mixed
in
no
complexity
and
no
flavor
so
bland
i
could
barely
finish
it
i
used
to
like
this
is
but
no
more
avoid
this
was
one
of
my
dads
favorite
beers
from
a
can
poured
into
a
footed
pilsner
glass
this
is
a
light
transparent
yellow
color
with
a
white
pretty
head
unfortunately
the
head
doesnt
last
very
long
seems
to
have
a
little
less
carbonation
than
other
similar
macros
not
much
of
an
aromagrain
cornnothing
else
slightly
sweet
very
lightfairly
smooth
with
a
lessthancrisp
finish
nothing
distasteful
but
nothing
worthwhile
either
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
dies
off
quickly
almost
no
lacing
the
smell
is
light
with
just
a
hint
of
malty
and
grassy
aromas
the
taste
is
also
grassy
and
malty
but
its
very
light
on
flavor
nothing
offensive
though
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
watery
the
drinkability
is
good
though
if
i
had
to
choose
a
macro
to
pair
with
pizza
this
would
be
it
tried
pbr
again
for
the
first
time
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
much
more
flavor
than
the
big
three
hoppy
aroma
and
a
clean
fresh
taste
maybe
i
just
was
lucky
and
got
a
fresh
bottle
but
for
the
money
it
cant
be
beat
my
new
go
to
beer
when
money
is
tight
i
started
drinking
this
beer
after
i
became
tired
of
the
overhyped
premium
brews
out
there
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
with
little
or
no
head
smells
like
malt
and
nothing
else
taste
of
the
beer
is
balanced
not
too
overpowering
of
hopsmalt
and
cant
detect
the
alcohol
in
the
beer
i
can
drink
this
beer
all
day
while
i
like
the
premiums
i
am
not
afraid
to
slum
it
pours
like
seltzer
with
the
slightest
tinge
of
pee
smells
like
seltzer
with
the
slightest
tinge
of
pee
as
well
taste
is
rather
nonexistent
it
is
impressively
smooth
no
skunk
from
this
macro
but
the
smoothness
is
so
easy
to
create
if
there
is
no
taste
however
i
could
down
probably
2x
the
number
of
these
than
any
other
beer
overall
id
pick
this
over
all
the
other
macros
if
im
playing
beer
pong
taste
is
upfront
sweet
adjunct
presence
with
the
slightest
of
crispness
at
the
outset
the
main
observation
i
am
presented
with
is
watery
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
okay
for
the
style
fits
the
3
average
for
me
the
only
negatives
are
lacks
of
positives
good
for
mowing
the
lawn
which
i
will
be
doing
momentarily
final
thought
this
is
the
second
best
beer
for
price
per
quality
honey
brown
definately
a
session
beer
when
taste
is
irrelevant
to
your
state
of
drunkeness
now
from
a
goblet
i
find
there
is
an
objectionable
odor
vaguely
nutty
only
putrid
and
rotten
nuts
phony
cotton
candy
sweetness
and
ad
hoc
bittterness
i
had
hoped
this
would
showup
a
baltic
lager
open
on
my
desk
it
did
not
i
cant
figure
out
why
this
is
the
darling
of
slumming
bas
mhl
is
lots
better
no
change
of
score
pours
out
a
dingy
but
clean
yellow
a
big
ole
snow
white
head
to
begin
with
that
settled
down
a
thin
film
lacing
wasnt
much
to
speak
of
aroma
was
of
cooked
cabbage
like
smell
as
well
taste
was
thin
watery
and
not
overly
exciting
a
grainy
taste
corn
husks
and
steamed
veggies
carbonation
was
biting
but
tolerable
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
not
very
bitter
not
very
malty
but
dry
as
a
bucket
of
sand
not
a
terrible
beer
pretty
standard
macro
lager
i
wont
complain
but
there
are
better
macros
out
there
enjoy
so
far
ive
pretty
much
only
been
reviewing
beers
that
i
thought
were
exceptional
but
tonight
im
paying
a
little
homage
to
our
old
friend
pbr
looks
like
any
cheap
beer
pale
yellow
not
much
head
at
all
too
many
bubbles
smell
doesnt
really
entice
me
at
all
just
reminds
me
of
keggers
the
taste
actually
isnt
as
bad
as
most
cheap
beers
not
much
flavor
at
all
pretty
much
just
watery
with
a
touch
of
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
i
can
actually
feel
the
bubbles
popping
in
my
mouth
well
i
dont
enjoy
it
a
whole
lot
but
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
ok
so
we
all
know
pbr
isnt
the
best
of
beers
but
its
not
the
worst
at
all
id
say
its
the
best
macro
beer
out
there
perhaps
after
all
it
was
selected
as
americas
best
in
1893
anyway
plenty
of
more
interesting
beers
out
there
we
are
all
aware
of
this
i
would
hope
but
hey
go
easy
on
the
little
guy
when
youre
in
a
pinch
for
cash
and
in
need
of
a
party
a
case
of
pabst
may
come
in
handy
cheers
beer
is
good
happy
beering
still
the
20
oz
chalice
i
received
for
4
00
on
a
hot
day
to
down
my
mexican
food
was
aok
as
it
is
refreshing
and
a
little
more
exciting
than
water
its
like
beerflavored
soda
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
mass
produced
american
beer
as
a
responsible
journalist
ill
admit
my
bias
this
is
the
house
beer
at
nyabinghi
in
youngstown
oh
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
clubs
buck
a
can
on
monday
nights
come
on
down
and
join
the
pb
army
the
taste
was
pretty
awful
strong
presence
of
adjuncts
either
rice
or
corn
i
guess
a
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
like
tonic
water
and
even
though
we
were
out
on
a
boat
in
the
sun
i
couldnt
drink
any
more
of
these
a
decent
looking
lager
from
the
pour
out
of
the
can
pale
golden
but
lots
of
carbonation
as
well
as
a
fairly
impressive
foamy
white
head
it
doesnt
last
long
but
its
also
something
i
dont
see
very
often
on
an
adjunct
lager
either
the
aroma
is
light
slightly
sour
accompanied
by
a
corn
sweetness
as
well
although
i
begin
to
wonder
if
there
is
a
contingent
of
rice
adjunct
in
there
too
the
flavour
is
light
and
pretty
unoffensive
there
is
a
slight
underlying
sweetness
and
the
mouthfeel
and
body
makes
me
think
that
rice
is
the
primary
adjunct
at
work
here
not
much
malt
thats
for
sure
this
would
probably
be
the
best
cheap
lager
you
can
pick
up
in
canada
at
the
moment
given
the
price
damn
near
a
buck
a
can
which
is
almost
unheard
of
and
completely
unheard
of
for
other
drinkable
beer
in
that
category

what
do
you
expect
beer
is
expensive
in
oklahoma
because
of
high

taxes
btw
i
didnt
go
into
this
tasting
with
too
many
high
hopes
and
didnt
come
away
feeling
any

this

might
be

that
i
usually
get

there
wasnt

have

youre
in

drinkability
a
little
grainy
and
crisp
not
offensive
mouthfeel
was
watery
it
is
drinkable
most
think
its
far
from
being
a
good
beer
period
but
i
really
do
enjoy
pbr
its
quite
possibly
the
perfect
simple
beer
go
into
it
not
expecting
much
and
youll
be
rewarded
hansomely
its
certainly
better
than
the
major
macros
out
there
it
even
has
some
mild
character
to
it
i
like
it
i
probably
drink
more
of
this
than
any
other
single
beer
with
a
matching
light
flavor
mostly
corn
coming
through
for
me
kinda
sweet
i
place
this
brew
in
the
same
company
as
strohs
my
own
cheap
brew
of
choice
in
college
and
miller
high
life
a
step
above
most
of
what
the
big
three
macros
have
to
offer
as
it
is
enjoyed
by
everyone
from
jocks
to
punks
to
hillibillies
i
hung
out
with
a
few
guys
who
used
to
live
across
the
street
from
a
beer
distributor
in
pittsburgh
they
would
buy
a
few
cases
of
pbr
in
the
afternoon
hard
to
get
much
head
on
it
a
little
sweet
tasting
with
some
hops
not
that
bad
easy
to
slam
several
down
when
youre
used
to
drinking
8
beer
all

wanted
to
get
another

under

two
this

can
do
you
proudespecially
if
on
a
budget
the
only
problem
is
if
you
drink
more
than
three
or
i
am
doing
yard
work
this
is
my
beer
it
tastes
damn
good
a
bit
of
a
head
that
goes
away
after
a
bit
there
isnt
much
to
the
taste

driven
by

with

very

there
ive
done
it
nice
lawnmower
brew
but
given
the
choice
id
cough
up
the
extra
sawbuck
for
a
sixer
of
ballantine
xxx
i
heard
that
this
was
the
beer
of
choice
at
my
school
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
and
bought
a
case
for
8
99
from
the
can
the
pbr
poured
a
pale
golden
yellow
the
originally
fluffy
head
disappeared
pretty
quickly
and
the
beer
looked
painfully
macrobland
the
smell
was
of
adjunct
corn
i
think
but
with
a
tiny
hint
of
malt
still
not
much
happening
the
taste
really
wasnt
too
shabby
though
refreshing
with
a
pleasant
malt
taste
and
a
small
sample
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
perhaps
a
bit
gritty
on
the
tongue
but
overall
pretty
clean
and
smooth
for
a
cheap
beer
this
isnt
bad
i
have
to
give
the
frat
guys
at
school
more
credit
among
the
cheapies
pbr
gets
my
vote
this
thinly
malted
light
lager
gets
most
of
its
elevated
status
as
result
of
hollywood
created
propaganda
this
rest
of
its
reputation
is
based
on
the
fact
that
even
though
its
cheap
swill
its
pretty
decent
cheap
swill
pale
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
and
fast
fading
lace
the
aroma
is
pretty
bland
and
smells
like
american
beer
poured
from
a
can
oh
yeah
it
was
medium
hops
with
a
slight
metallic
bite
and
some
citrus
bitterness
theres
something
cool
about
pabst
truly
an
original
try
pabst
in
a
bar
bottle

forget
the
can
poured
out
a
bubbly
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
one
but
i
was
surprised
to
say
that
it
was
a
well
blended
and
smooth
light
pale
lager
does
not
have
the
harshness
of
a
bud
or
a
miller
slightly
hoppy
and
grainy
drinkable
and
not
that
bad
at
all
enjoy
note
pbr
is
the
official
beer
of
geologists
yeah
at
12
50
for
a
30
pack
of
cans
its
hard
to
beat
this
for
a
lawnmower
macroswill
selection
i
prefer
the
bottles
in
overall
taste
but
poured
out
of
the
can
this
one
has
a
very
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
fizzy
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
going
on
this
beer
is
designed
for
people
like
me
in
college
and
broke
so
as
far
as
aroma
goes
its
has
a
cereal
grain
adjunct
based
aroma
but
its
actually
not
that
bad
kind
of
pleasant
in
fact
i
can
definitely
get
down
with
this
beer
for
its
taste
price
and
flavor
cant
go
wrong
taste
is
sweet
with
some
balancing
hop
bitterness
to
create
one
of
the
best
shittiest
beers
in
the
world
an
american
classic
that
is
designed
to
be
drank
in
high
capacity
not
usually
the
beer
i
drink
but
i
would
choose
it
over
bud
coors
miller
etc
in
a
heartbeat
hadnt
tasted
it
until
now
picked
up
a
sixpack
because
the
recent
resurgence
of
its
popularity
peaked
my
interest
hard
to
find
out
here
in
the
phoenix
area
though
red
white
and
blue
you
cant
go
wrong
pbr
the
king
of
massproduced
swill
appearance
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
a
pale
lager
golden
color
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
the
faintest
of
lace
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
but
the
smell
hmm
thats
different
an
american
macrobrew
with
hops
say
it
isnt
so
the
taste
is
very
crisp
very
clear
sharp
and
biting
on
the
tongue
mellowing
afterwards
a
little
grainy
but
nowhere
near
millers
grainy
taste
its
not
much
but
its
cheap
and
it
beats
anything
ab
can
put
out
for
generic
swill
this
is
definitely
btb
the
old
pabst
quality
is
still
here
and
still
wining
friends
for
the
formula
while
it
is
still
in
the
class
of
mainstream
lagers
it
is
a
cut
above
many
others
inviting
appearance
but
with
a
quickly
departing
white
head
the
taste
is
fullbodied
and
has
a
bit
of
corn
added
but
the
hops
cut
into
the
sweetness
this
is
a
thirst
style
lager
that
is
still
a
go
to
in
many
markets
presentation
the
classic
12
ounce
can
with
the
recognizable
pabst
blue
ribbon
logo
pours
a
faint
yellow
thin
head
which
quickly
disappears
slight
husky
and
corn
aroma
but
was
very
difficult
to
detect
a
little
malt
and
somewhat
of
a
grassy
or
hay
taste
very
light
body
pleasant
to
drink
based
on
the
undetectable
adjuncts
i
wont
let
the
six
pack
go
to
waste
but
still
only
slightly
above
average
pbr
is
difficult
to
find
in
eastern
s
d
no
joke
well
after
hearing
how
people
liked
this
beer
compared
to
the
other
big
macros
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
at
first
it
looked
like
any
other
macro
beer
little
smell
very
bubbly
when
i
first
tasted
it
i
thought
this
tastes
like
every
average
light
beer
however
my
mind
changed
after
it
got
a
little
air
and
warmed
slightly
suddenly
i
could
taste
some
light
malt
and
a
slight
wheat
flavor
it
is
more
complex
than
most
macros
while
this
is
still
not
a
terrific
beer
it
is
amazing
for
the
price
6
50
for
a
12pk
pretty
cheap
even
if
it
was
the
same
price
as
bud
or
bud
light
i
would
probably
still
buy
it
over
those
it
has
better
character
overall
its
not
really
anything
special
but
quite
good
for
a
cheap
macro
beer
24
oz
2x4
can
pours
a
bright
clear
goldenyellow
color
has
a
decent
foamy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
light
grainy
aromas
starts
with
a
light
dry
grainy
flavor
finishes
clean
with
a
little
sweetness
not
much
aftertaste
i
have
to
admit
pbr
maybe
the
best
american
macro
i
have
ever
had
a
well
spent
99
cents
f
feels
grat
and
is
very
drinkable
as
a
result
all
in
all
a
good
american
lager
no
frills
but
beware
in
my
opinion
its
far
better
this
way
in
the
bottle
than
in
the
can
if
you
havent
had
a
pabst
please
withhold
judgement
until
you
tried
it
a
very
good
budget
beer
smooth
state
and
highly
drinkable
it
pours
out
a
short
head
that
disappears
in
very
short
time
overall
i
would
much
rather
have
this
than
a
bud
or
coors
something
about
this
beer
simply
has
more
to
offer
than
many
others
that
are
higher
priced
okay
i
couldnt
resist
bettys
which
had
nothing
but
craft
beers
on
tap
decided
to
add
this
beer
as
their
one
macro
it
was
a
straw
color
and
had
a
very
small
white
head
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
had
a
slight
hop
aroma
but
the
major
aroma
was
of
grain
the
flavor
was
also
of
grain
had
a
slight
bit
of
bite
to
the
finish
much
better
beer
on
tap
than
budweiser
or
miller
probably
why
bettys
picked
it
taste
sweet
malt
balanced
pretty
well
with
the
hops
big
flavor
for
an
inexpensive
american
lager
filling
a
chewy
mouthfeel
semicreamy
sweet
my
main
impression
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
short
finish
i
am
in
agreement
with
other
bas
that
this
beer
while
not
especially
good
is
certainly
no
worse
than
many
common
heavily
advertised
mainstream
lagers
american
or
otherwise
why
pay
more
if
this
is
what
you
want
to
drink
didnt
a
character
from
david
lynchs
blue
velvet
emphasize
this
point
about
pbr
in
rather
strong
terms
pairs
well
with
cheap
mexican
food
pbr
pours
a
white
head
over
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
beer
but
unfortuntly
it
all
goes
downhill
from
here
this
beer
has
a
mild
skunky
smell
but
hardly
any
aroma
at
all
its
taste
is
nonexistent
and
its
body
thin
its
only
saving
grace
is
that
you
can
drink
it
like
water
if
i
paid
more
than
the
25
cents
a
beer
i
would
have
felt
ripped
off
but
at
that
price
i
guess
i
cant
complain
this
was
quite
enjoyable
for
such
a
cheap
beer
i
call
this
a
working
on
the
cartruck
type
of
beer
i
think
it
would
pair
well
with
bbq
food
or
corn
chips
along
with
strohs
pabst
makes
two
cheap
beers
that
are
quite
consumable
pabst
on
tap
what
more
can
i
say
well
actually
a
lot
this
beer
is
really
cheap
and
fairly
good
especially
for
the
price
can
you
beat
1
a
glass
i
think
not
anyways
back
to
the
good
stuff
has
real
light
color
and
real
light
taste
you
can
definately
tast
the
malt
in
it
but
it
doesnt
ruin
the
flavor
also
nice
on
the
tastebuds
its
definately
not
some
beer
made
by
monks
in
france
but
its
worth
buying
especially
if
your
poor
or
in
college
like
most
beers
its
better
on
tap
easy
drinking
brew
with
questionable
appearance
but
seriously
folks
there
is
no
head
on
this
beer
this
little
critter
is
bald
having
said
that
taste
is
well
rounded
tad
malty
sweetness
no
lingering
after
taste
medium
body
that
promotes
session
awareness
i
finally
broke
down
and
purchased
my
first
pabst
blue
ribbon
tonight
ive
been
scared
to
death
of
this
beer
but
i
faced
my
demons
and
took
the
challenge
this
was
actually
a
pretty
good
cheap
beer
for
the
price
i
rank
it
up
there
with
miller
high
life
bottom
line
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
cheap
beer
that
reminds
you
of
the
good
old
days
high
school
and
college
this
is
the
beer
for
you
being
poor
lately
i
have
had
a
chance
to
sample
some
of
the
cheaper
beers
this
is
only
an
average
brew
and
that
even
takes
into
account
the
price
of
it
it
has
a
light
straw
color
that
leaves
something
to
be
desired
but
it
does
pour
with
a
much
better
head
than
most
poor
mans
beer
and
it
thins
out
to
leave
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
minimal
lace
the
taste
is
very
decent
with
nice
malty
flavor
it
has
an
aroma
of
corn
and
not
much
else
it
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
very
easy
i
barely
enjoyed
this
beer
but
found
it
to
be
drinkable
but
there
are
still
many
other
brews
that
i
would
put
in
my
list
above
this
one
one
thing
about
this
beer
that
i
really
did
not
like
was
the
tightness
in
my
head
that
it
caused
that
appeared
after
i
only
drank
like
four
i
dont
think
i
will
get
this
one
again
even
if
i
am
running
low
on
funds
my
experience
with
the
sleemans
rendering
was
pleasant
enough
that
i
may
buy
a
6pack
or
so
in
hot
weather
if
my
cashflow
is
a
bit
limp
at
the
time
brilliant
yellow
color
and
has
a
white
head
that
melts
away
into
a
fine
lace
it
is
laden
with
that
familliar
domestic
lager
aroma
a
bit
of
skunky
adjuncts
tastes
husky
at
first
followed
by
a
slight
corn
sweetness
which
is
quickly
cut
by
a
brief
grassy
bitterness
wich
gives
the
beer
a
relatively
dry
finish
the
only
aftertaste
to
speak
of
is
that
of
alcohol
and
wood
no
malt
flavor
neither
too
bubbly
nor
thin
though
not
a
particularly
good
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
either
it
may
replace
schmidts
as
my
cheap
domestic
lager
of
choice
my
favorite
low
grade
beer
can
not
beat
the
price
it
does
not
have
that
over
manufactured
taste
that
most
macros
have
smooth
and
easy
going
a
kegger
favorite
must
be
consumed
in
a
plastic
cup
ill
take
this
over
most
other
macros
notes
this
is
a
great
premium
american
lager
hands
down
beats
the
big
three
about
the
same
in
the
bottle
but
obviously
better
on
tap
a
perfect
change
up
when
things
get
a
bit
tedious
and
want
to
drink
a
simple
beer
good
ole
pbr
as
reliable
that
old
pick
up
truck
or
a
good
dog
pbr
is
my
emptywallet
beer
of
choice
as
i
can
get
a
case
of
16oz
tall
gentleman
for
11
50
it
definetly
beats
any
macro
hog
wash
for
alot
less
money
yea
man
i
know
what
you
mean
by
cringing
when
people
make
jokes
about
it
when
they
actually
think
heinekein
is
a
good
beer
it
bothers
me
too
the
mouthfeel
is
a
lil
watery
but
the
carbonation
evens
it
out
so
that
it
is
not
a
detriment
to
enjoying
it
the
taste
is
balanced
a
slight
hoppy
grain
and
lightly
malted
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
its
balance
realtive
lightness
and
cost
doesnt
inhibit
anyone
from
pounding
them
out
pours
translucent
light
gold
with
a
pretty
impressive
white
foam
the
foam
dissapates
and
leaves
a
lace
around
the
glass
smell
leaves
something
to
be
desired
mostly
corn
adjuncts
and
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
taste
is
actually
somewhat
complex
corn
malt
a
little
fruity
flavor
no
hops
to
speak
of
has
a
thin
mouthfeel
as
one
would
expect
with
high
carbonation
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
need
a
3
six
pack
and
better
than
most
american
macro
lagers
pours
exceptionally
well
is
a
pale
yellow
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
lasts
amazingly
long
for
the
style
and
actually
leaves
some
lace
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
definitely
the
weak
point
of
this
brew
it
is
better
than
most
with
a
slightly
corn
and
adjunct
smell
but
still
not
all
that
great
of
a
smell
taste
is
great
for
the
style
with
its
incredibly
creamy
and
smooth
sweetnessslight
fruitiness
and
fairly
crisp
mouthfeel
the
brew
is
very
drinkable
and
an
absolute
pleasure
compared
to
the
other
macros
and
even
compared
to
a
lot
of
cheap
brew
you
really
cant
get
any
better
for
the
price
at
9
a
case
it
is
a
steal
ultra
pale
yellow
tinge
ultra
translucent
with
a
head
that
reached
about
inch
before
it
dissipated
soapy
retention
very
sporadic
and
spotty
lace
it
is
not
very
much
to
look
at
sweetish
nose
adjuncts
would
seem
to
be
influential
honestly
it
isnt
very
inviting
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malt
is
very
much
noticeable
vague
influence
of
adjuncts
the
mildestlightest
hops
influence
the
palate
is
decent
it
can
warm
to
a
degree
and
it
doesnt
have
to
be
served
icecold
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body
very
drinkable
there
always
seems
to
be
a
time
and
a
place
for
some
pbr
it
is
just
too
cheap
not
to
drink
3
80
for
a
6pack
this
is
a
great
fridge
stocker
and
you
cant
beat
the
price
pbr
leaves
a
pleasant
bitter
hops
aftertaste
that
says
put
more
pbr
in
please
i
must
admit
i
really
wanted
to
dislike
this
beer
going
in
but
it
wasnt
that
bad
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
decent
pours
out
to
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
fluffly
white
head
smell
is
somewhat
funky
almost
chemical
but
the
actual
taste
has
some
hints
of
caramel
and
a
very
slight
hop
bitterness
seeing
as
pabst
brews
this
and
schlitz
i
can
see
why
they
taste
similar
i
could
swear
they
were
the
same
beer
with
very
subtle
differences
am
american
classic
that
might
be
stretching
it
drinkable
yes
and
no
different
than
most
american
standard
lagers
rock
on
pbr
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
that
is
about
all
i
can
say
about
it
i
absolutely
despise
the
mass
produced
garbage
that
is
made
in
this
country
but
for
some
reason
i
can
always
tolerate
a
little
pbr
stranger
things
have
happened
i
dont
know
this
has
been
reviewed
a
lot
here
and
a
lot
seem
to
like
it
but
i
just
dont
know
very
boring
imho
simple
easy
almost
like
your
not
having
a
beer
at
all
take
a
big
sip
swallow
and
its
like
did
i
just
take
a
sip
of
beer
or
was
that
i
day
dream
it
is
cheap
for
sure
and
when
i
bought
it
it
was
like
90
degrees
and
i
had
a
bunch
of
beer
sitting
in
the
cellar
that
wasnt
very
cold
and
i
just
needed
some
cold
damn
beer
so
i
figured
10
99
what
the
hell
ok
i
guess
i
dont
know
had
always
heard
of
this
beer
growing
up
but
never
tried
one
figured
it
for
lawnmower
beer
even
though
i
would
not
choose
it
again
if
i
had
better
choices
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
very
light
in
color
and
the
smell
is
really
the
only
drawback
better
than
most
of
the
beers
we
see
all
the
time
on
tv
cheers
sampled
straight
from
the
can
how
else
are
you
supposed
to
drink
a
pbr
this
beer
is
no
better
or
worse
than
any
other
macro
american
light
lager
but
it
has
a
serious
advantage
of
being
2
69
a
six
the
only
problem
with
it
is
that
holding
a
can
of
it
makes
you
want
to
have
sex
with
your
cousin
beer
my
grandpa
and
uncle
used
to
drink
swill
or
pound
it
was
and
still
is
cheeep
pbr
is
the
brew
i
was
weened
on
used
to
steal
a
sip
when
i
was
just
a
wee
lad
pabst
has
a
unique
flavor
which
actually
has
a
slight
hop
after
taste
i
have
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
for
many
years
despite
its
shortcomings
however
it
is
a
gem
compared
to
others
in
its
price
class
can
you
blame
me
for
trying
other
types
of
beer
im
going
to
rate
this
beer
in
context
to
schlitz
mainly
because
they
are
similiar
beers
and
i
really
have
trouble
finding
stuff
to
rate
about
these
kinds
of
beers
because
they
are
so
simple
its
hard
to
describe
them
while
i
found
the
schlitz
to
possess
both
more
hop
flavors
grassythan
any
other
common
macro
i
can
think
of
the
pbr
was
much
less
bitter
the
schlitz
was
also
metallic
tasting
the
grassy
hops
meshing
with
another
flavor
perhaps
and
the
pbr
lacked
this
the
pbr
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
schlitz
but
still
remains
crisp
it
doesnt
even
become
undrinkable
cold
too
bad
typical
beer
swillers
think
this
beer
is
below
them
it
really
is
a
good
cheap
beer
that
being
said
the
only
times
ill
be
likely
to
buy
this
is
for
times
when
im
not
looking
to
really
enjoy
the
beer
but
looking
for
something
that
goes
down
easily
and
provides
some
social
lubrication
pours
a
very
light
pale
yellow
and
is
very
clear
it
has
a
soapy
type
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
the
smell
is
very
faint
and
slightly
sweet
the
creamy
mouthfeel
is
well
above
all
the
other
big
macro
brews
the
taste
is
fair
with
no
off
tastes
at
all
just
lacking
in
distinct
character
there
are
actually
slight
hints
of
hops
in
this
brew
unfortunately
i
couldnt
find
it
in
bottles
so
i
had
to
pour
mine
out
of
a
can
very
drinkable
cheap
cheers
light
straw
with
thick
big
bubbled
head
quick
to
disappate
smells
sweet
with
noticible
adjunct
smell
tastes
smooth
and
somewhat
sweet
with
a
smooth
drinkable
mothfeel
goes
down
clean
and
refreshing
moderate
carbonation
adds
to
this
fine
macro
lager
surprisingly
good
i
was
curious
about
a
bettertasting
macro
lager
so
here
i
am
pale
and
clear
yellow
head
is
not
stiff
and
has
little
staying
power
just
a
bit
of
a
malty
smell
its
pretty
pleasant
in
flavor
not
overcarbonated
hops
shortlasting
but
not
inandout
malt
is
sweet
if
nondescript
but
theres
ok
balance
here
doesnt
finish
with
an
unsettling
impression
in
my
stomach
well
pbrs
are
more
or
less
drinkable
in
a
pinch
but
its
no
undiscovered
miracle
thanks
to
michael
p
for
buying
a
twelve
pack
and
his
sister
liza
p
for
bringing
me
a
can

for
a
standard
american
beer
this
stuff
isnt
all
that
bad
there
is
nothing
bad
i
can
really
say
yet
nothing
good
either
the
plain
jane
of
all
beers
the
best
american
macro
lager
it
has
a
clean
taste
with
good
body
it
pains
me
to
see
that
this
classic
american
beer
is
not
beating
the
pants
off
bud
i
respectfully
suggest
that
when
the
need
arises
warm
weather
you
find
it
in
long
neck
bottles
chilled
down
cold
and
enjoy
please
tell
your
establishment
to
buy
it
now
before
its
too
late
now
on
to
this
beer
pbr
is
a
better
beer
than
most
people
give
it
credit
for
being
this
was
my
dads
beer
back
in
the
70s
the
first
thing
that
impressed
me
when
i
sat
down
to
grade
it
was
the
aroma
for
a
basic
american
lager
the
smell
is
inviting
about
the
perfect
bodycharacter
for
its
style
not
a
lot
of
maltinessnowhere
close
to
high
life
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
a
tich
of
hops
evident
but
not
as
heavy
as
strohs
jvery
smooth
though
and
creamy
on
the
back
of
the
tounge
just
a
basic
solid
version
of
an
american
lager
i
plan
on
doing
a
blind
taste
test
between
this
and
high
life
the
only
other
macro
i
have
around
the
house
i
like
high
life
better
but
believe
it
or
not
pbr
is
one
of
the
better
american
lagers
out
there
in
my
opinion
i
would
have
to
agree
that
pbr
is
a
solid
american
lager
that
exceeds
expectations
in
all
categories
better
than
bud
mgd
michelob
coors
etc
and
in
my
book
battles
high
life
for
best
american
macro
it
has
a
pleasant
kind
of
a
floral
hop
aroma
relatively
full
bodied
a
bit
sweet
and
a
grainy
grassy
flavor
with
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
that
allows
it
slide
down
like
silk
nothing
special
but
nothing
bad
which
is
good
pretty
tart
at
the
beginning
and
then
vanishes
other
than
a
lingering
alcohol
bitterness
which
is
the
primary
flavoring
agent
pbr
was
the
first
beer
i
had
back
in
the
stone
age
and
i
drank
a
good
bit
of
it
in
those
days
ah
the
folly
of
youth
rated
from
previous
tasting
notes
overall
this
brought
me
way
back
to
my
days
in
the
marines
old
milwaukee
beer
tents
out
in
the
field
it
tasted
better
back
then
but
hey
it
isnt
horrible
now
im
not
a
lager
guy
but
if
i
dont
have
a
choice
and
i
have
to
pick
one
i
will
pick
this
one
for
the
price
actually
not
bad
lol
absolutely
awful
the
taste
of
old
milwaukee
is
so
repulsive
i
would
only
drink
it
if
the
life
of
another
human
being
depended
on
it
worst
macro
ever
very
similar
to
pbr
as
with
pbr
id
say
avoid
bottles
and
go
with
cans
cheers
could
it
get
any
worse
middle
of
the
road
aal
have
had
worse
good
lawnmower
type
beer
lite
crisp
and
refreshing
overall

hey
its
not
all
that
bad
its
a
bottom
shelf
beer
sure
but
ive
had
way
way
way
way
worse
for
8
a
12
pack
or
4
a
6
pack
its
a
cheap
beer
and
great
with
beef
sticks
which
i
opted
for
as
a
combo
instead
of
buying
a
bar
beer
at
2
a
pop
while
i
went
to
waste
10
at
the
vid
lot
machine
seemed
much
more
economical
to
spend
4
on
a
six
pack
drank
from
the
can
can
see
light
yellow
some
little
lace
smell
is
yeast
and
adjuncts
dry
smell
taste
is
dry
and
yeasty
and
adjuncts
almost
like
pbr
but
boozier
to
me
makes
my
face
hot
fairly
quickly
i
like
it
as
much
as
my
go
to
pbr
parties
in
college
i
paid
the
5
dollars
entrance
fee
before
i
knew
what
they
were
serving
for
what
it
is
om
comes
in
just
behind
pbr
as
the
dirt
cheap
ajunct
ale
of
choice
overall
i
rated
this
in
comparison
with
other
adjunct
lagers
and
quite
frankly
this
beer
tastes
as
clean
and
refreshing
as
all
the
others
at
a
cheaper
price
this
will
be
my
cheap
goto
beer
when
needed
maybe
this
beer
was
not
stored
properly
or
was
abused
somehow
i
was
expecting
more
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
the
appearance
and
aroma
are
inviting
but
it
just
doesnt
taste
that
good
not
bad
brew
very
similar
to
pbr
but
not
as
good
still
rather
have
an
ice
cold
old
mil
than
a
budweiser
or
coors
any
day
old
mil
has
decent
hops
for
a
cheap
beer
and
it
is
excellent
for
mixing
with
stouts
and
porters
to
make
cheap
amber
lagers
for
6
99
a
12
pack
it
is
hard
to
beat
and
much
better
than
its
main
competitor
on
the
shelf
milwaukees
best
this
beer
actually
won
some
awards
back
in
the
day
so
give
it
a
break
and
evaluate
it
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
american
style
beer
its
not
going
to
challenge
or
excite
your
tongue
but
it
dosnt
bother
mine
at
all
i
think
pbr
is
better
but
this
one
is
better
that
high
life
in
my
opinion
overall
ok
especially
at
the
bargain
price
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
old
milwaukee
beer
is
classic
brew
it
pours
a
golden
amber
color
this
brew
has
a
little
white
head
old
milwaukee
has
a
sweet
taste
it
not
bad
mouth
feel
is
that
of
an
american
style
beer
nice
and
smooth
over
all
i
give
this
beer
a
3
out
of
5
it
is
nothing
special
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
pale
yellowishamber
color
clear
with
no
cloudiness
lots
of
carbonation
malty
aromas
but
not
from
barley
corn
rice
tastes
of
sweet
maltiness
cant
really
discern
any
hops
feels
robust
but
the
carbonation
balances
it
out
a
bit
look
this
is
just
not
a
great
beer
but
i
had
to
go
grab
one
and
review
it
for
a
couple
of
reasons
1
takes
me
back
to
golfing
with
the
boys
in
college
and
2
reminds
me
of
my
grandfather
a
mans
man
who
took
it
to
the
nazis
back
in
44
in
a
b24
got
shot
down
and
walked
200
miles
to
the
adriatic
sea
to
be
rescued
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
if
this
is
all
you
got
it
isnt
that
bad
for
some
reason
i
actually
like
this
karp
the
best
of
the
style
imo
i
typically
wait
to
try
mainstream
americancanadian
adjunct
lagers
if
they
happen
to
show
up
at
various
social
functions
or
restaurants
where
there
are
few
other
better
beer
options
too
fizzy
and
weak
flavorwise
as
a
general
rule
although
these
beers
can
be
nostalgic
and
are
great
if
you
really
are
just
in
the
mood
to
drink
socially
without
constantly
taking
tasting
notes
or
analyzing
everything
else
going
on
with
the
brew
old
milwaukee
is
very
very
pale
straw
colored
with
the
requisite
level
of
mouthnumbing
carbonation
and
white
foam
also
classic
is
the
muted
tenuous
flavor
profile
and
aroma
this
example
is
cornforward
and
fairly
sweet
corn
meal
and
boiled
dough
along
with
some
subtle
offflavors
the
sweetness
tastes
a
bit
artificial
like
aspartame
chalky
and
dry
body
keeps
the
sweetness
lower
than
in
some
other
adjunct
lagers
but
the
corniness
and
cooked
flavors
do
add
a
little
nuance
i
suppose
mellow
and
largely
unoffensive
typical
american
adjunct
lager
straw
color
no
lacing
tastes
like
every
other
adjunct
lager
cheap
but
better
than
a
light
beer
id
recommend
this
if
your
going
to
a
party
and
want
to
bring
alot
of
it
for
cheap
this
is
a
way
to
go
its
crispcarbonated
and
you
can
drink
alot
of
these
before
you
feel
it
overall
one
is
the
best
discounted
american
adjunct
lagers
out
there
old
milwaukee
has
that
old
school
beer
taste
which
you
real
can
not
find
in
many
beers
today
o
no
surprises
this
is
pretty
bad
if
you
dropped
a
shot
glass
of
pbr
into
a
cup
of
club
soda
itd
be
pretty
close
to
old
milwaukee
not
much
difference
between
this
macro
and
the
others
o
this
is
a
very
cheap
beer
with
a
bad
rep
and
i
would
argue
a
bad
rap
as
well
i
think
it
is
great
for
the
price
point
which
is
3
99
for
a
sixer
of
pounders
by
me
that
makes
it
just
about
the
cheapest
notonsale
beer
i
can
buy
however
it
is
light
years
away
from
great
or
even
good
and
i
would
likely
be
telling
a
completely
different
tale
if
it
wasnt
just
out
of
a
cold
fridge
p
s
i
have
just
been
informed
by
my
son
that
he
no
longer
has
to
drink
old
mill
as
he
can
now
afford
better
beer
its
a
great
beer
to
buy
in
bulk
if
you
are
supplying
free
beer
for
a
bbq
or
something
well
it
says
on
the
top
of
the
can
americas
best
tasting
beer
if
that
was
true
id
move
now
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
should
only
drink
if
its
free
and
even
then
not
always
its
your
average
watered
down
nothing
to
it
beer
heavily
carbonated
theres
a
hint
of
hoppiness
which
is
nice
but
theres
a
weird
sweetmetalic
flavor
that
just
shouldnt
be
there
its
a
little
malty
and
is
drinkable
the
bad
tastes
that
are
there
arent
overbearing
but
thats
probably
because
simply
everything
about
this
beer
is
not
overbearing
it
smells
like
someone
spilled
beer
on
your
couch
three
days
ago
but
to
its
credit
it
also
smells
crisp
and
grassy
like
a
corn
field
aftertaste
is
nonexistent
which
is
nice
because
as
bad
as
this
beer
is
at
least
it
doesnt
stick
around
old
milwaukee
from
a
can
poured
into
dimpled
mug
appearance
is
light
yellow
fizzy
with
huge
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
is
harsh
and
grainy
taste
is
smooth
drinkability
is
very
high
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
little
watery
old
milwaukee
is
a
great
lawnmower
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
cheap
beers
its
a
good
beer
cheap
price
if
its
cold
its
very
refreshing
ill
pick
it
up
once
in
a
while
this
and
if
i
recall
this
beer
won
5
gold
medals
from
2003
2007
at
the
great
american
beer
festival
tastes
like
corn
and
water
just
like
all
of
the
other
unexciting
american
macrolagers
surprisingly
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
subdued
in
comparison
to
other
adjunct
pale
lagers
and
i
kind
of
wish
it
wasnt
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
slick
this
is
bad
but
not
horrible
especially
for
the
price
overall
simple
and
highly
drinkable
with
no
highly
offensive
off
flavors
with
its
cheap
price
it
makes
for
a
decent
partysession
brew
hoping
to
finish
this
spelunky
spree
soon
as
one
can
only
take
so
much
death
before
it
starts
to
grate
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
wheat
and
light
grass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
some
added
sweet
corn
and
some
funkier
wheat
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
sad
little
adjunct
lager
one
that
hardly
seems
suitable
for
drinking
on
its
own
without
some
effort
read
beer
ping
and
the
like
oh
well
back
to
dying
pathetically
and
not
learning
from
my
mistakes
drink
why
didnt
i
try
this
sooner
i
guess
i
listened
to
the
stereotypes
about
this
beer
picked
up
2
6packs
of
the
16
oz
variety
at
walmart
in
san
antonio
it
was
only
3
45
a
6pack
well
worth
every
penny
i
should
have
bought
more
we
dont
have
it
in
my
lil
hole
in
the
wall
town
it
goes
down
so
smoothly
has
a
hint
of
a
sweet
taste
to
it
i
will
definitely
buy
this
the
next
time
i
head
to
s
a
pretty
rotten
gear
here
but
still
better
than
some
crappy
30
pack
stuff
pours
pale
and
yellow
but
who
pours
an
old
milwaukee
right
this
is
a
right
out
of
the
can
product
for
sure
it
smells
a
tad
metallic
but
mostly
just
watery
not
much
of
a
nose
at
all
which
i
guess
is
better
than
a
repulsive
aroma
boring
the
flavor
is
about
as
exciting
as
the
nose
maybe
a
touch
of
pale
pale
malt
but
thats
about
it
this
is
flavored
water
to
me
but
the
feel
isnt
horrible
great
carbonation
maybe
even
too
much
and
a
real
light
body
very
drinkable
if
you
like
but
dont
plan
on
getting
drunk
on
this
stuff
and
feeling
very
good
not
bad
when
its
freezing
cold
but
i
will
never
ever
ever
buy
this
o
overall
its
a
cheap
beer
not
impressive
but
much
better
than
that
wrongly
marketed
flavored
water
know
as
strohs
but
it
definitely
doesnt
hold
up
to
its
lables
claim
as
americas
best
tasting
beer
fine
adjunct
drinking
with
the
guys
beer
tastes
bland
and
insipid
like
soggy
saltines
and
watery
tea
astringent
feel
not
bitter
so
many
confuse
the
two
with
a
carbonic
bite
from
high
co2
levels
if
you
want
to
get
bloated
here
is
the
beer
for
you
smoother
than
strohs
but
thats
not
saying
much
not
something
im
inclined
to
finish
especially
as
it
warms
up
in
the
summer
heat
best
thing
going
for
it
is
the
nostalgiathrowback
brand
appeal
and
the
will
ferrell
commercials
drinkability
though
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
in
regards
to
adjuncts
it
is
not
bad
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
for
a
camping
trip
its
pretty
easy
to
understand
why
this
beer
wins
gold
medals
when
you
try
it
it
is
a
solid
beer
with
good
flavor
and
it
is
also
very
refreshing
this
is
a
very
good
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
an
adjunct
lager
on
a
budget
but
also
want
some
flavor
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
old
milwaukee
it
may
not
be
americas
best
tasting
beer
but
it
is
a
very
good
beer
old
mill
was
as
staple
of
the
70s
and
80s
everyone
knows
it
simply
dont
get
no
better
than
this
keystone

i
will
keep
trying
new
ones
when
i

them
this
one
is
so
damn
cheap

would
do
at
a
party
or
a
camping
trip
nothing
bad
at
all
about
carbonated
pbr
quantity
makes
up
for
quality
the
old
old
swillwaukee
of
my
college
days
is
back
with
all
of
the
gusto
of
a

there
just

this
has
gotta
be
the
best
adjunct
lager
ive
had
since
schlitz
and
olympia
its
very
very
easy
to
drink
like
most
of
em
its
om
for

534for
being
an
economy
brand
it
was
good
plus
it
was
steve
mcqueens
favorite
brew
so
that
adds
some
cool
points
poured
into
glass
from
can
nice
fluffy
foamy
head
on
this
one
clear
and
yellow
as
expected
smell
is
a
bit
stale
and
corny
initial
taste
is
suprisingly
not
terrible
clean
and
bright
american
beer
taste
corn
without
much
aftertaste
no
hop
taste
or
bitter
finish
just
a
straightforward
adjunct
pale
lager
mouthfeel
is
nearly
invisible
for
a
heavy
not
great
but
better
than
some
of
its
style
mates
tastes
like
regular
beer
too
nothing
special
but
it
does
remind
me
of
the
beer
i
had
when
i
was
younger
that
i
would
taste
from
my
dad
pretty
nasty
stuff
it
has
only
a
tangential
relationship
with
the
way
beer
should
taste
im
well
acquainted
with
lowcost
american
beers
as
my
reviews
attest
and
om
is
really
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
dont
even
consider
it
fratparty
material
a
la
milwaukees
best
it
just
doesnt
even
try
will
not
be
missed
if
and
when
it
fades
away
except
by
some
of
my
buds
who
went
to
college
in
the
upper
midwest
and
maybe
not
even
by
them
poured
a
light
yellow
with
a
decent
head
and
carbonation
smell
is
a
generic
stale
odor
but
not
bad
taste
is
clean
with
a
slight
grainy
flavor
goes
down
smooth
easy
enough
flavor
to
put
it
way
ahead
of
any
light
beer
good
summer
beer
when
served
cold
or
session
drinkers
on
a
tight
budget
its
ok
though
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
overall
id
say
its
a
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
good
for
a
game
of
beer
pong
or
something
like
that
but
if
im
going
to
sit
down
and
relax
with
a
good
beer
i
wont
choose
this
rjt
d
isnt
true
the
slogan
that
says
americas
best
tasting
beer
taste
is
pretty
clean
with
some
husky
grain
coming
through
a
touch
of
stale
cardboard
flavor
can
be
found
along
with
a
mild
sparkling
water
taste
not
a
whole
lot
here
but
i
can
see
this
being
refreshing
when
thirsty
not
bad
for
an
aal
pretty
average
actually
has
a
pretty
cheap
price
tag
to
boot
i
got
6
tallboys
for
4
99
it
is
what
it
is
and
for
what
it
is
an
adjunct
lager
it
is
pretty
damn
good
poured
from
a
16oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
mild
some
notes
of
corn
taste
is
greatly
lacking
not
much
flavor
at
all
here
feels
light
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
fairly
good
overall
there
is
not
much
to
say
or
like
about
this
beer
overall
for
5
39
a
sixer
of
16oz
cans
this
will
be
my
go
to
when
pbr
or
schlitz
isnt
available
or
if
im
not
in
the
micro
mood
or
um
broke
i
have
to
admit
ive
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
ole
mil
pour
is
typical
of
beers
of
this
style
in
both
color
and
head
it
also
has
the
slight
corn
aroma
associated
with
adjunct
lagers
as
far
as
taste
id
much
rather
have
one
of
these
than
a
host
of
other
macros
real
easy
drinking
as
long
as
you
get
it
drank
while
its
nice
and
cold
i
would
say
this
is
under
appreciated
as
far
as
american
macros
go
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
fast
white
head
aggressive
pours
that
was
gone
as
quick
as
it
came
no
lacing
no
retention
thin
corn
and
malt
smell
thin
mouthfeel
with
some
slight
malt
taste
and
a
little
grainy
in
the
finish
lets
be
honest
on
a
hot
day
at
the
lake
fishing
or
boating
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
for
the
cost
why
not
compare
to
some
others
you
know
what
i
am
talking
about
not
something
to
give
to
guests
but
for
a
refreshing
brew
on
a
hot
day
it
is
tolerable
the
mouth
is
thin
and
wet
no
carbonation
bite
at
all
flavor
is
muted
grains
light
bread
and
finishes
slightly
buttery
and
sweet
this
is
a
decent
cookout
brew
but
thats
about
it
honestly
if
you
must
there
are
better
macros
than
this
out
there
smeone
once
told
me
i
had
to
try
old
milwaukee
when
i
couldnt
afford
a
case
of
bud
so
here
i
am
drinking
my
4th
one
on
monday
afternoon
tricky
beer
couldnt
discern
any
hops
or
grains
mainly
water
however
it
does
promote
a
nice
mouthfeel
some
beers
in
this
category
ring
a
bitter
taste
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
but
this
one
does
not
i
think
my
30
pack
was
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
because
it
has
a
definate
hint
of
age
i
will
call
this
one
old
mildue
but
will
buy
again
for
the
second
fridge
when
things
are
desperate
picked
up
a
cheap
12
pack
for
a
campout
this
was
a
family
friends
1
and
only
beer
when
i
was
growing
up
its
not
too
bad
for
a
subpremium
lager
11
49
a
case
12
ounce
cans
i
actually
poured
one
into
a
pint
glass
so
i
could
see
the
color
and
stuff
for
the
review
this
is
one
of
the
quintessential
old
school
american
adjunct
brews
it
isnt
great
but
it
is
definitely
drinkable
pale
gold
a
decent
bit
of
head
that
goes
poof
quick
taste
is
beer
as
imagined
by
that
machine
that
makes
arthur
dent
some
tea
in
the
hitchhikers
guide
i
recognize
corn
a
bit
of
malty
sweet
up
front
and
a
teeny
tiny
bit
of
hops
on
the
back
end
of
the
deal
at
this
price
point
nothing
ive
tasted
is
better
and
anyways
whats
chewbaccas
favorite
beer
old
milwookie
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
there
was
a
one
finger
head
which
disappeared
quickly
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
somewhat
musty
with
a
lot
of
corn
on
the
nose
it
is
thin
and
watery
without
much
flavor
or
character
i
dont
know
how
anybody
drinks
this
it
was
free
to
me
so
i
didnt
lose
any
money
buying
it
it
goes
down
real
easy
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
to
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
not
exactly
an
award
winner
overall
old
milwaukee
is
a
decent
adjunct
lager
at
an
incredible
price
probably
the
best
beer
value
on
the
market
go
for
it
if
you
want
an
inexpensive
brew
that
gets
the
job
done
had
a
schlitz
and
decided
to
try
and
old
milwaukee
same
company
not
the
same
beer
schlitz
is
far
superior
it
was
almost
like
drinking
a
flat
schlitz
nothing
exciting
rather
dull
not
bad
no
aftertaste
just
kind
of
boring
fairly
drinkable
and
probably
as
good
as
miller
maybe
better
but
nothing
to
make
me
run
out
and
buy
it
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
but
it
doesnt
taste
bad
to
me
cheap
beer
exposes
itself
when
drank
with
food
and
old
milwaukees
flaws
are
evident
but
its
okay
out
of
a
16
0z
can
this
brew
was
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
perfect
clarity
the
head
was
pure
white
two
fingers
large
and
displayed
average
retention
and
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
was
slightly
stale
pale
malt
macro
lager
malt
dry
grains
corn
and
minerals
the
flavors
were
very
dry
and
grainy
pale
malt
and
some
light
hops
clean
and
simple
the
finish
was
a
little
off
however
bitter
but
not
in
a
hoppy
way
the
mouthfeel
was
rough
and
foamy
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
high
if
the
finish
and
the
body
were
worked
on
this
one
could
be
pretty
good
but
as
is
even
for
the
style
i
found
it
subpar
bottum
line
the
slogan
americas
bet
tasting
beer
may
be
a
bit
ambitious
but
for
50
cents
a
can
it
may
as
well
be
this
is
a
brew
that
holds
a
nostalgic
place
in
my
heart
had
a
case
of
these
at
about
4550
degrees
the
day
before
my
and
my
friends
left
for
college
stayed
in
the
can
so
i
cant
say
much
about
the
color
but
the
taste
was
decent
considering
the
cost
of
the
beers
once
again
considering
cost
i
would
buy
this
beer
great
party
stocker
if
youre
expecting
a
lot
of
people
poured
from
a
16
fl
oz
can
marked
02029d50621
this
is
one
of
those
rare
instances
where
the
brands
light
beer
is
tastier
than
its
regular
old
standby
this
pours
pale
yellow
into
the
pint
glass
with
about
12
inch
of
white
foamy
head
typical
beer
aroma
of
american
pales
with
that
sort
of
metallic
grassy
and
lightly
hopped
scent
lots
of
bubbling
carbonation
watery
for
the
most
part
theres
something
grassy
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
in
the
taste
nothing
exciting
their
slogan
is
americas
best
tasting
beer
it
doesnt
get
much
cheaper
than
this
old
mil
in
a
can
a
light
clear
golden
with
a
large
white
head
and
big
carbonation
aroma
is
corn
grains
light
citrus
and
soapy
hints
flavor
is
mild
bitter
malts
hops
corn
wheat
it
is
just
a
typical
cheap
macro
swill
but
i
find
it
refreshing
and
i
sort
of
like
cheap
swill
from
time
to
time
there
was
a
can
in
the
fridge
so
i
decided
i
might
as
well
review
it
the
beer
poured
a
a
yellowtinted
clear
with
a
twofinger
head
caused
by
a
vigorous
pour
that
didnt
last
long
the
smell
is
all
corny
malt
adjunct
tastewise
theres
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
it
starts
off
with
some
sweet
corn
taste
and
then
that
goes
away
and
thats
it
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
how
drinkable
it
is
its
slightlyalcoholic
carbonated
cornwater
but
goddamn
if
it
isnt
crisp
and
refreshing
after
something
like
mowing
the
lawn
or
putting
a
new
different
colored
door
on
the
irocz
sitting
up
on
blocks
in
the
yard
felt
good
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
actually
pretty
good
i
saw
these
at
the
store
and
thought
what
the
hell
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
one
and
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
actually
not
bad
would
make
a
good
lawnmower
beer
it
pours
a
light
pee
color
small
head
tastes
terrible
and
id
rather
spend
the
extra
2
dollars
for
a
12
of
miller
lite
im
not
a
big
cheap
beer
drinker
i
go
for
the
more
microbrewed
beer
so
i
might
not
be
so
good
at
judging
these
beers
but
i
didnt
like
it
for
the
price
this
beer
is
one
of
my
overall
favorite
discount
macros
very
well
done
a
simple
beer
that
gets
the
job
done
i
like
this
one
working
on
a
12pack
so
far
dont
really
mind
drinking
it
except
at
first
for
the
seltzer
qualities
followed
quickly
by
a
slight
sense
of
flatness
and
after
a
while
the
corn
seems
more
and
more
emphasized
but
hey
i
like
corn
flakes
so
why
not
have
this
sometimes
mmm
beer
on
a
cob
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
the
carbonation
has
a
scrubbing
effect
goes
down
easy
enough
but
i
dont
think
ill
go
back
to
this
one
drinkability
as
far
as
american
macro
lagers
go
this
is
very
easy
drinking
and
might
be
my
favorite
wow
i
hadnt
had
this
in
years
and
now
i
wont
have
to
drink
it
again
for
several
years
i
hope
theres
little
about
the
flavor
that
resembles
an
allmalt
beer
it
relies
heavily
of
yeast
character
which
is
just
a
bit
like
the
green
apple
found
in
budweiser
but
watered
down
and
gone
rancid
avoid
this
one
at
all
costs
yes
it
could
have
been
more
offensive
but
it
was
still
no
treat
to
drink
didnt
pour
it
out
of
the
can
to
be
honest
had
a
metallic
smell
this
is
a
decent
watery
cheap
beer
to
buy
when
youre
reliving
the
ol
college
days
and
playing
drinking
card
games
with
some
buddies
has
a
quasisweet
malt
taste
and
the
use
of
adjuncts
is
minimal
very
light
hop
presence
but
is
not
at
all
bitter
or
going
to
nuke
your
taste
budsstomach
like
other
cheap
american
macros
goes
down
lightbodied
and
smooth
because
of
the
wateriness
but
this
isnt
horrible
easy
going
down
after
23
you
cant
even
tell
you
have
started
in
overall
i
feel
this
is
just
a
run
of
mill
american
lager
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
nothing
to
avoid
as
it
runs
right
along
with
the
other
budget
lagers
well
this
is
what
it
is
it
can
get
worse
but
not
a
whole
lot
worse
very
pale
looking
beer
with
very
little
head
or
lacing
better
than
the
beast
but
still
not
much
in
flavor
and
has
an
old
musty
grainy
foul
malty
taste
and
aftertaste
at
least
its
cheap
d
while
wont
blow
you
away
it
wont
totally
turn
you
off
a
tad
sweet
but
fairly
clean
would
drink
if
the
greater
of
lesser
options
at
a
party
but
wouldnt
spend
my
money
at
it
average
for
what
it
is
i
highly
doubt
that
i
will
ever
drink
this
beer
again
on
draft
at
a
nice
little
biker
bar
i
was
at
yesterday
been
a
long
time
so
i
enjoyed
a
few
i
used
to
drink
this
from
time
to
time
back
in
the
day
it
was
inexpensive
and
always
made
for
a
good
camp
fire
beer
no
redeeming
qualities
just
good
old
cheap
pale
lager
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
feels
like
cold
tonic
water
in
the
mouth
not
much
here
light
and
fizzy
with
no
lasting
flavor
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
my
fall
back
macro
get
smashed
and
goes
good
with
greasy
american
foods
burgers
pizzaokay
its
italian
etc
would
have
to
be
strohs
or
old
style
the
can
states
this
was
brewed
byjos
schlitz
brewing
company
milwaukee
wi
but
we
all
now
its
another
of
pabsts
beer
corpses
i
get
a
kick
out
of
its
trademark
slogan
americas
best
tasting
beer
and
wonder
what
critical
methodology
they
used
to
come
to
that
conclusion
easily
drinkable
in
the
way
water
is
drinkable
it
works
after
work
on
a
98
degree
day
like
today
2008
3
2138

54dgood
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
on
a
hot
day
jun
07
2008
i
was
recently
in
whitewater
and
had
to
stop
at
one
of
my
favorite
liquor
stores
in
search
for
tasting
all
of
the
beers
that
pabst
brewery
makes
i
looked
but
came
to
no
avail
so
i
decided
to
pick
up
one
of
my
staple
beers
old
milwaukee
the
cans
have
a
new
design
which
are
cooler
looking
then
the
old
dumb
om
symbol
the
look
i
poured
straight
into
a
mug
foam
quickly
appears
at
the
top
and
quickly
disappears
light
golden
transparent
color
average
taste
nothing
overpowering
about
it
more
alcohol
than
anything
corn
and
other
grains
mixed
in
with
it
mouthfeel
dry
easy
going
down
not
much
to
offer
drinkability
average
nothing
to
bad
about
this
beer
good
for
drinking
all
day
doesnt
get
old
fast
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
a
beer
but
i
wouldnt
jump
up
and
down
about
it
a
light
body
and
large
carbonation
does
make
it
a
fun
beer
to
drink
if
you
are
doing
manual
labor
ice
one
down
and
shotgun
it
after
mowing
the
lawn
i
will
use
this
one
to
cook
with
but
thats
about
it
unless
i
am
in
a
real
pinch
well
i
tried
this
beer
as
a
joke
but
i
ended
up
liking
it
12oz
can
and
after
drinking
a
few
of
these
i
went
for
a
bud
and
i
thought
bud
was
way
to
bitter
for
my
liking
so
i
gave
those
away
at
my
last
softball
game
where
i
am
it
is
11
67
per
case
of
cans
and
i
cant
go
wrong
with
that
no
hangovers
for
me
with
this
brew
it
tastes
great
ice
cold
after
work
too
it
doesnt
break
my
wallet
either
my
new
everyday
beer
or
pbr
im
forgetting
about
bud
products
there
is
a
reason
my
friends
call
this
old
mill
water
tried
this
one
when
their
was
nothing
else
to
drink
poured
a
pale
straw
color
with
some
fizzy
shooting
bubbles
smells
of
some
soaked
cereal
grains
and
a
hint
of
malts
tastes
like
watered
down
corn
flakes
with
nothing
jumping
out
at
me
at
all
md
quite
thin
a
slight
bite
i
wouldnt
recommend
drinking
this
stuff
pretty
tough
to
choke
down
pours
a
clear
straw
with
fast
fading
dense
white
head
and
spotty
lacing
smell
cereal
grains
sweet
malt
quite
crisp
hops
taste
cereal
grains
touch
of
alcohol
slight
hop
and
dms
mouthfeel
overly
crisp
and
thin
not
bad
for
a
cheap
macro
lager
d
ill
never
drink
this
again
not
even
on
a
dare
this
stuff
it
that
bad
there
are
better
cheap
as
dirt
beers
out
there
serious
yellow
fizzy
stuff
going
on
here
it
could
be
ginger
ale
until
the
corn
kicks
in
smooooth
corn
hoss
and
the
flavor
is
real
mellow
too
i
bought
a
case
of
16
oz
cans
of
this
stuff
in
pennsylvania
and
i
havent
looked
back
since
i
cant
see
much
anyway
on
this
beer
but
really
its
not
a
bad
macro
totally
harmless
and
almost
flavorless
but
it
has
a
grip
on
the
tongue
and
the
adjunct
cereal
grain
character
is
perfect
for
fishing
lunchtime
or
warm
joyrides
finishes
less
corny
sweet
than
most
macros
so
i
can
reach
for
one
more
a
pint
can
actually
on
the
pour
my
first
thought
was
wow
the
color
is
virtually
nonexistent
i
just
put
a
stream
into
the
urinal
that
had
more
color
than
this
not
a
good
start
i
will
however
say
this
for
the
cheapies
they
create
a
big
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
tremendous
retention
throughout
it
was
very
impressive
actually
the
nose
was
grainy
sweet
silagelike
on
this
last
if
you
have
done
any
farming
you
will
get
my
drift
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
approaching
creamy
there
was
a
light
sweetness
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
finish
did
i
get
my
2
00
worth
sure
but
it
was
not
something
that
i
would
scrounge
for
again
even
worse
than
budweiser
miller
and
coors
used
to
drink
the
14
ounce
cans
twentyfive
years
ago
in
high
school
a
beer
of
mass
consumption
with
only
one
purpose
only
redeeming
quality
is
cheap
price
no
taste
character
aroma
or
complexity
next
taste
is
heavily
adjunctladen
yet
somehow
the
whole
is
slightly
more
than
the
parts
light
malt
sweetness
mingles
with
cereal
grains
that
remain
smooth
with
no
truly
offputting
flavors
strong
metallic
finish
could
be
blamed
on
a
can
yet
sadly
this
is
in
a
glass
bottle
would
be
baseline
drinkable
if
not
for
the
metal
twinge
i
had
a
really
tough
time
getting
past
the
smell
of
this
beer
it
is
just
unpleasantly
cerealy
and
reminds
me
of
everything
i
dont
like
about
bad
beer
combine
that
with
a
rather
unimpressive
appearance
and
a
light
yet
unpleasant
cereal
flavor
and
you
have
yourself
a
real
winner
here
id
rather
have
a
miller
lite
any
day
pours
a
very
light
yellow
with
head
that
fades
fast
aroma
is
very
light
and
somewhat
bland
somewhat
sweet
as
well
taste
is
very
sweet
corny
and
light
on
aftertaste
not
offensive
goes
down
easy
just
not
impressive
at
all
its
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
though
so
im
going
to
give
it
an
average
rating
down
here
sc
everything
is
bud
so
om
isnt
that
bad
goes
down
cold
nicely
i
used
to
drink
this
beer
back
in
the
early
70s
quantity
over
quality
and
after
drinking
bud
light
and
miller
lite
its
pretty
good
does
bud
make
anything
worth
while
anyhow
for
lawnmower
beers
this
rivals
pbr
as
the
most
drinkable
to
me
you
can
taste
the
malts
which
automatically
puts
it
above
most
macrolagers
its
refreshing
and
does
what
its
supposed
to
for
that
id
say
not
bad
overall
your
average
macro
may
be
sweeter
than
most
however
d
not
bad
for
cheapo
shitbeer
heilemans
is
about
the
best
in
the
buisness
but
they
also
make
pbr
and
stag
which
are
much
better
beers
imo
but
i
might
buy
this
again
who
knows
in
short
old
milwaukee
is
a
solid
american
beer
and
can
take
care
of
you
in
a
pinch
the
taste
is
semi
sweet
theres
some
malt
and
grain
going
on
with
some
hop
character
that
bitters
it
but
the
flavours
are
light
on
the
palate
i
havent
tasted
this
for
years
and
im
sure
ill
not
taste
it
again
for
many
more
years
to
come
just
too
damn
common
and
bland
old
milwaukee
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
an
enormous
white
head
from
a
sixteen
ounce
can
the
aroma
starts
out
being
sweet
but
then
something
chemical
seems
to
pop
up
to
the
front
bland
grainy
and
unfortunately
a
chemical
taste
too
i
have
bad
memories
of
this
beer
as
a
youth
instant
hangover
no
matter
how
little
imbibed
avoid
a
must
have
for
any
beer
bong
overall
its
a
cheap
beer
i
believe
a
dirty
thirty
was
only
around
10
but
i
would
much
rather
have
passed
on
this
d
this
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
however
it
was
not
as
good
as
pbr
i
might
try
this
again
but
only
if
left
with
very
few
options
1
50
12
oz
bottle
at
old
fashioned
in
madison
wi
ugly
new
label
tries
to
court
nostalgic
but
ends
up
offending
them
pours
light
yellow
with
some
bubbles
and
a
nice
white
lacing
ultra
transparent
smells
likenot
much
maybe
a
little
corn
and
some
veggies
but
really
not
a
whole
lot
smooth
and
creamy
with
almost
no
taste
there
could
be
malt
andor
hops
in
this
beer
but
its
difficult
to
tell
there
could
also
be
corn
or
rice
but
again
i
cant
taste
much
of
anything
drinks
well
though
goes
right
down
tastes
clean
no
noticeable
adjuncts
at
least
not
overly
sweet
or
carbonated
just
perfectly
balanced
balancedon
nothingness
ill
take
a
pbr
over
this
but
it
beets
most
of
the
other
cheap
swill
out
there
this
is
cheap
and
not
much
of
a
brew
it
pours
a
nice
light
gold
and
actually
has
a
nice
head
if
you
could
make
it
on
appearance
alone
we
would
on
our
way
to
a
decent
rating
but
the
nose
is
a
sour
fermeted
rice
aroma
and
the
flavor
is
not
much
better
it
has
a
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
and
has
excessive
cabonation
in
a
world
with
so
many
great
beers
to
select
from
there
is
no
reason
to
choose
this
one
pale
yellow
beer
with
a
smallish
fizzy
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
very
little
lacing
of
note
smells
of
sweet
grainy
malts
taste
is
surprising
decent
given
the
price
of
this
beer
unoffensive
if
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
a
tad
too
fizzy
in
the
mouthfeel
department
an
average
macro
brew
at
best
24oz
can
very
very
light
yellow
translucent
body
almost
water
colored
smells
like
many
other
macro
lagers
with
hints
of
hop
malt
and
corn
light
watery
taste
with
a
little
corn
sweetness
and
hints
of
dms
very
light
watery
body
with
only
moderate
carbonation
the
good
news
is
that
its
drinkable
enough
considering
the
nonoffensive
flavor
and
watery
mouthfeel
otherwise
this
beer
isnt
good
for
much
other
than
when
you
dont
have
much
money
i
guess
cheers
pale
goldenyellow
with
a
mediumlarge
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
thin
film
smell
is
grain
yeast
and
light
corn
with
a
little
stink
to
it
the
taste
is
actually
rather
good
for
a
macro
cheapo
bready
lightly
sweet
and
some
very
light
berry
in
there
it
has
a
thin
body
lightly
dry
texture
about
the
only
sign
of
hops
in
this
beer
and
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
was
refreshing
and
satisfying
its
not
all
that
good
and
the
smell
isnt
too
pleasant
but
overall
its
not
bad
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
in
the
realm
of
macros
can
poured
a
lightly
carbonated
golden
yellow
color
lager
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
corn
adjunct
is
way
too
powerful
and
gross
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
adjunct
with
too
much
sugar
another
bland
offering
from
this
awful
brewery
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
initial
large
white
chunky
head
that
rather
quickly
dissapeared
smell
is
slightly
sweet
but
little
else
taste
is
very
light
with
some
mild
sweetness
found
finishes
very
thin
in
the
mouth
very
freshing
when
ice
cold
but
less
so
as
it
warms
5
99
for
a
12pack
that
should
tell
you
how
crappy
this
beer
is
this
is
the
palest
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
pure
white
head
is
at
first
quite
impressive
but
soon
fades
to
nothing
the
only
thing
that
distinguishes
this
glass
from
a
glass
of
cold
piss
is
the
slight
carbonation
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
not
much
else
corn
comes
out
the
strongest
taste
is
the
same
that
tangy
grimaceinducing
flavor
common
to
macros
corn
aftertaste
is
no
better
if
you
try
you
can
taste
a
little
alcohol
which
so
far
is
the
only
reason
to
ingest
this
substance
as
for
mouthfeel
this
beer
somehow
seems
thinner
than
water
very
slight
carbonation
very
drinkable
if
you
have
a
cold
dont
try
this
at
home
overall
a
fine
macro
as
far
as
macros
go
you
may
find
yourself
reaching
for
a
second
can
of
this
stuff
a
close
3rd
to
pbr
and
schlitz
for
ne
for
cheap
macros
definately
a
good
beer
for
the
buck
also
its
great
to
have
during
the
summer
outside
when
you
just
want
to
relax
and
get
drunk
i
would
buy
again
but
only
in
the
summer
time
just
a
very
casual
drinking
beer
when
i
dont
really
care
about
quality
very
pale
color
with
a
fizzy
head
head
is
large
and
dies
instantly
smells
cereal
grainy
with
a
touch
of
corn
more
taste
than
many
macros
but
the
taste
is
downright
bad
a
very
strong
metallic
flavor
lies
in
there
combined
with
an
adjunct
corn
flake
flavor
once
the
corn
flake
flavor
leaves
the
metallic
flavor
dominates
and
lingers
in
the
finish
body
is
a
touch
fizzy
but
a
bit
more
substantial
than
some
in
its
category
maybe
this
used
to
be
good
but
i
got
a
headache
after
drinking
this
can
terrible
the
mouth
is
thin
and
unassuming
drinkable
only
in
the
most
dire
circumstances
drinkability
for
iced
tea
very
drinkable
for
beer
how
can
they
make
this
claim
i
remember
somewhat
hazily
that
this
beer
years
ago
was
a
staple
for
myself
and
my
fraternity
brethren
also
that
it
required
a
special
draft
system
as
the
keg
taps
were
different
from
all
the
other
swill
beers
we
we
were
copiously
imbibing
on
a
daily
basis
it
also
came
in
smaller
diameter
cans
like
coors
products
at
the
timelate
80searly
90s
we
drank
enough
of
this
stuff
to
float
a
battleship
esp
during
our
annual
beer
olympicsa
la
beerfest
the
movie
because
of
the
speed
of
intake
i
really
dont
remember
much
about
the
taste
ergo
i
picked
up
a
5
00
12
pack
to
stumble
down
amnesia
lane
a
standard
macro
color
straw
yellow
but
with
more
carbonation
and
head
than
most
bmc
products
with
a
surprisingly
enduring
lace
s
sweet
corn
and
grains
no
real
hops
to
speak
of
t
not
bad
with
a
mild
smoothness
and
slight
corn
sweetness
it
also
doesnt
worsen
as
the
beer
warms
like
budweiser
m
standard
macro
watery
with
lack
of
viscosity
d
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
choice
if
cash
is
low
and
the
plan
is
to
obtain
a
buzz
which
was
always
the
plan
in
college
om
and
esp
om
light
are
very
nice
choices
for
cheap
macros
when
selection
is
limited
and
volume
consumption
is
the
main
objective
drinkability
do
i
have
to
finish
the
glass
tastes
better
when
chugged
that
says
something
overall
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
unless
it
was
given
to
me
on
a
hot
day
as
a
cool
down
beverage
ah
this
beer
brings
back
fond
memories
of
my
underage
drinking
days
in
high
school
and
college
hanging
out
by
the
river
with
my
buddies
and
some
half
naked
women
while
guzzling
six
packs
of
this
stuff
and
then
waking
up
in
the
morning
next
to
a
girl
that
i
dont
recognize
now
on
to
the
review
as
expected
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
large
one
inch
head
that
dissipated
quickly
aroma
was
very
strong
of
cornadjuncts
along
with
a
cooked
vegetable
smell
not
very
good
taste
was
slightly
better
as
long
as
the
beer
was
very
cold
i
could
taste
the
ever
present
corny
flavor
with
some
malt
character
way
in
the
backround
there
was
also
a
lemonycitrusy
taste
that
was
thirstquenching
and
pleasant
in
the
94
degree
heat
of
the
afternoon
hop
flavor
was
not
present
the
finish
was
very
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
as
the
beer
warmed
i
was
unable
to
finish
the
can
and
had
to
dump
it
oh
well
my
memories
will
always
be
there
but
i
will
not
be
drinking
om
again
my
tastes
in
beer
have
matured
too
much
since
then
while
the
american
macro
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
style
this
one
is
one
of
the
worse
ive
tasted
give
it
a
try
dont
let
the
price
scare
you
this
cheap
brew
is
pretty
good
you
know
what
it
isnt
bad
no
worse
than
any
other
macro
out
there
i
mean
its
skunky
but
doesnt
taste
bad
and
is
extremely
drinkable
its
a
thirst
quencher
if
you
are
going
for
a
macro
no
reason
to
spend
any
more
money
than
is
necessary
710
ml
can
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
really
pissy
looking
strange
fluffy
loose
white
head
no
lace
or
retention
smell
is
sweet
honey
metallic
maybe
citrus
taste
is
nasty
really
pissy
and
sweet
strange
metallic
flavour
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
one
of
the
nastiest
beers
ive
ever
had
and
not
what
i
would
expect
the
pabst
brewery
cheers
very
typical
macro
lager
pours
yellowygolden
color
white
head
that
is
here
one
minute
gone
the
next
smells
like
beer
tastes
like
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
nothing
bad
either
thin
but
not
watered
down
doesnt
have
that
sour
finish
like
some
other
macros
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
and
it
is
priced
right
average
do
not
get
a
very
nice
smell
or
any
at
all
taste
like
water
with
some
malt
added
in
very
little
and
i
mean
very
little
as
about
non
at
all
this
is
not
really
the
best
tasteing
brew
but
what
else
can
you
expect
for
five
dollars
a
12
pack
ultimate
budget
beer
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
is
the
motto
on
the
can
really
drinking
carbonated
water
pours
quite
fizzy
the
head
disappears
quickly
the
clearest
yellow
coloring
youve
ever
seen
taste
well
i
can
detect
the
slightest
grainy
malt
flavor
and
that
is
it
nothing
but
water
granted
this
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
but
how
can
you
really
call
this
beer
i
wonder
what
a
light
version
of
this
beer
would
be
like
so
i
broke
down
and
bought
a
couple
of
24oz
cans
of
this
stuff
a
little
earlier
as
empty
as
my
pockets
are
good
beer
just
isnt
accessible
thought
i
might
as
well
rate
it
at
first
it
tastes
just
like
any
other
american
macro
brew
only
with
a
little
touch
of
sourbitterness
during
the
aftertaste
but
maybe
thats
just
a
tincan
flavor
the
closer
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
can
the
more
watery
it
begins
to
taste
almost
like
the
little
flavor
that
is
there
is
all
at
the
top
i
do
notice
that
this
beer
actually
smells
fairly
nice
the
nose
is
quite
mild
but
the
smell
i
get
almost
reminds
me
of
stella
im
not
sure
how
thats
possible
and
im
going
to
assume
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
my
smelling
senses
tonight
weird
mouthfeel
is
alright
i
guess
a
little
thin
but
what
can
you
expect
drinkability
is
decent
if
youre
broke
and
in
need
of
a
cheap
buzz
can
obtained
in
a
bunch
of
stuff
given
to
me
for
volunteering
for
2005

reviewed
from
detailed

liquid
crystal
clear
smells
of
corn
mild

and
some
dark
hops
tastes
thin
and
mild
a

and
iron
floral
hops
in

aftertaste
are
weak
and
easy
on
the
tongue
corn

main
players
light

and
md
carbonation
hurray
a
macro
where
carbonation
isnt
a
dominant
flavor
scored
to
style
not
my
preferences
most
of
my
family
dont
like
this
beer
is
piss
water
said
but
for
me
is
good
better
i
say
than
the
anheuser
busch
family
beers
macros
of
course
its
palate
is
wide
smell
like
broiled
hops
little
herbal
too
taste
had
a
touch
of
yeast
rice
and
very
soft
for
me
try
direct
from
the
can
or
serve
in
a
pint
glass
85
recommended
for
being
a
macro
lager
it
was
ok
and
i
think
it
is
the
best
among
the
old
milwaukee
variety
the
colour
is
not
green
at
all
and
it
is
very
goldy
very
good
and
the
foam
is
nice
very
bubbling
and
it
is
what
it
counts
for
a
lager
at
least
for
me
i
cant
even
follow
my
normal
criteria
for
this
one
old
mil
is
your
everyday
normal
adjunctfilled
american
lager
with
fans
reminiscent
of
beast
or
pabst
looking
back
at
it
as
if
it
were
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
well
its
far
from
it
flat
taste
not
so
great
appearance
and
minimal
recollection
soon
after
drinking
of
any
difference
from
other
massproduced
beers
avoid
if
your
at
all
a
serious
beer
drinker
for
beers
with
mass
fan
clubs
though
you
could
do
worse
at
my
days
working
in
a
grocery
store
i
see
a
lot
of
people
mainly
the
elderly
buy
this
beer
people
would
come
in
3
even
4
times
a
week
and
purchase
18
24
andor
30
packs
of
old
milwaukee
after
witnessing
this
i
had
to
at
least
give
it
a
shot
i
obtained
a
24
oz
can
cracked
it
open
and
took
a
swig
the
taste
was
plain
and
flat
reminiscent
of
an
anheuserbusch
product
as
sick
as
it
was
i
thought
at
the
very
least
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
i
could
drink
it
quickly
and
move
on
however
a
terrible
extremely
bitter
aftertaste
followed
as
if
overcompensating
for
the
original
weak
taste
overall
the
taste
was
grainy
with
a
hint
of
corn
the
aroma
was
unappetizing
it
had
little
frothy
head
to
get
in
the
way
and
the
color
was
a
thicker
yellow
than
most
the
only
reason
i
finished
it
was
because
i
spent
my
own
money
on
it
and
by
time
i
was
done
i
was
barely
buzzing
if
there
was
a
beer
worse
than
the
swill
anheuserbusch
siphoned
from
the
sewers
this
would
be
it
not
much
say
here
looks
lighter
and
dirtier
than
piss
almost
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
nasty
metallic
horses
ass
it
might
make
you
cry
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
getting
stabbed
in
the
face
incredibly
not
drinkable
i
would
rather
drink
my
own
urine
this
is
a
good
cheap
beer
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
definetly
drinkable
not
bad
by
any
means
good
value
i
had
the
big
can
much
better
than
bud
light
and
the
like
it
is
best
cold
but
i
threw
the
last
few
swigs
out
as
it
warmed
and
grabbed
another
cold
one
if
your
going
to
buy
budweiser
buy
this
instead
it
tastes
much
better
and
is
way
easier
on
your
wallet
if
your
on
a
budget
and
you
want
something
that
doesnt
taste
like
crap
this
is
the
way
to
go
sometimes
i
use
this
as
a
spacer
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
average
at
best
moderate
carbonation
with
a
very
light
body
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
i
would
say
the
drinkability
is
about
average
because
the
flavor
doesnt
make
you
want
to
drink
a
bunch
its
an
o
k
beer
for
an
all
day
type
of
session
not
terrible
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
below
average
it
has
a
very
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
adjuncts
and
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
it
has
a
metallic
aroma
the
hops
are
light
and
it
has
a
musty
quality
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
dry
and
musty
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
slow
due
to
overcarbonation
and
finishes
clean
with
some
lingering
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
macro
lager
it
has
little
flavor
or
aroma
but
on
a
hot
day
this
would
go
down
easy
this
is
not
bad
but
not
recommended
by
any
means
12
oz
can
with
no
freshness
date
served
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
its
a
pale
gold
with
a
1
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
smells
of
adjuncts
and
cooked
veggies
flavors
are
corn
and
some
malts
with
a
light
and
tingy
body
serves
its
purpose
but
theres
more
drinkable
macros
old
milwaukee
isnt
good
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
it
is
good
enough
though
to
have
bested
one
of
americas
favorite
beers
beechwoodaged
budweiser
even
though
this
is
one
of
the
more
lopsided
macsmacks
so
far
im
still
not
interested
in
ever
having
this
stuff
cross
my
palate
again
old
milwaukee
has
a
reputation
around
these
parts
as
being
a
rather
poor
beer
clearly
its
better
than
many
macrobrews
simply
because
it
doesnt
actively
offend
add
to
that
a
relatively
low
price
and
youve
got
an
acceptable
emergency
hot
weather
beer
looks
like
white
apple
juice
decent
sized
white
fizzy
head
carbonation
rises
aggressively
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
in
a
macro
kind
of
way
and
a
little
grainy
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
body
is
medium
taste
has
some
decent
maltiness
to
it
for
a
macro
just
a
splash
of
hops
evident
in
the
dry
finish
not
too
bad
id
place
it
just
about
in
the
middle
of
my
spectrum
of
macro
brews
not
bad
tasting
but
way
too
fizzy
avoid
summary
i
may
have
had
this
beer
once
in
my
days
but
since
om
na
has
become
my
fave
na
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
look
see
again
i
paid
5
49
for
a
12
its
okay
but
nothing
will
make
me
buy
it
again
regular
genessee
is
about
the
cheapest
beer
ill
buy
when
i
want
something
cheap
pbr
is
still
my
autoworker
special
standard
for
cheap
beers
i
picked
up
a
32
ouncer
at
circle
k
because
i
was
feeling
like
something
simple
and
cheap
color
is
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
aroma
is
typical
of
cheap
macro
lagers
ive
smelled
a
lot
worse
than
this
within
this
style
of
beer
taste
isnt
very
flavorful
which
actually
may
make
old
milwaukee
better
than
some
of
its
counterparts
there
arent
any
bad
flavors
to
complain
about
seeing
how
cheap
and
unoffensive
this
is
i
would
consider
this
a
good
choice
for
a
lawnmower
beer
still
om
will
never
compete
with
my
craft
brew
choices
when
in
a
dive
bar
do
as
the
locals
do
i
figure
seems
to
me
that
the
locals
drink
a
lot
of
old
milwaukee
pouring
a
fizzy
yellow
colour
with
little
head
it
seemed
that
this
would
be
an
uneventful
tasting
the
aroma
was
sweet
i
couldnt
quite
place
the
smell
the
taste
was
coppery
hints
of
corn
came
through
but
nothing
original
heres
my
issue
with
this
beer
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
price
lager
but
up
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
its
priced
damn
near
the
buds
mgd
and
coors
its
of
lesser
quality
than
those
hasa
hint
of
cheap
beer
taste
to
it
very
corny
and
sweet
body
is
thin
almost
fizzy
finishes
a
little
tart
ok
not
worth
buying
though
another
on
my
crappy
beers
to
purchase
list
i
bought
this
after
a
case
of
schlitz
it
really
isnt
too
bad
not
much
to
her
at
all
some
sweetness
and
fizzles
here
and
there
but
nothing
too
crazy
a
much
better
beer
than
i
was
expecting
but
then
again
i
was
expecting
the
worst
for
the
price
you
really
cannot
beat
it
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
like
budweiser
but
much
cheaper
overall
this
isnt
bad
for
the
style
and
especially
for
the
price
like
so
many
american
macros
it
seems
like
a
little
more
flavor
and
aroma
hops
would
improve
it
a
lot
overall
a
strong
average
this
is
no
different
from
all
the
other
mass
produced
swill
i
have
poured
down
my
throat
over
the
past
few
weeks
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
bad
it
simply
just
does
not
taste
i
would
never
turn
this
phil
his
arm
extends
with
an
old
mil
in
hand
with
my
name
on
it
kinda
hits
the
spot
during
my
work
breaks
drinkability
this
stuff
drinks
to
fast
the
alcohol
content
seems
very
low
i
finished
off
the
box
in
2
afterwork
sessions
without
much
of
a
buzz
drinkability
for
the
price
and
the
taste
its
a
decent
value
i
doubt
if
most
macro
swillers
could
tell
the
difference
between
this
and
the
rmegalager
not
a
special
beer
but
for
the
money
a
good
beer
straw
yellow
color
and
odors
of
grain
and
alcohol
short
lived
white
head
strong
flavors
of
corn
dominate
this
brew
with
a
watery
finish
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
typical
pabst
brews
this
one
wont
dissapoint
ok
i
know
im
scrapin
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
here
but
we
all
need
to
consume
some
mass
produced
crap
to
keep
us
honest
and
keep
us
abreast
of
what
is
out
there
this
stuff
is
suprise
piss
yellow
with
a
large
bubble
short
lasting
head
not
much
nose
to
speak
of
ditto
for
malt
and
hops
it
is
cold
and
wet
and
did
help
me
wash
down
my
dinner
clear
yellow
color
small
white
head
slightly
malty
not
a
lot
in
the
hops
department
not
skunky
metallic
or
musty
like
many
beers
in
this
price
range
this
beer
when
judged
against
other
american
macros
is
actually
somewhat
of
a
standout
its
drinkability
affordablity
lack
of
off
flavors
and
wide
availabitlity
add
up
to
a
cheap
beer
that
wont
make
you
gag
at
least
this
is
a
brew
that
claims
to
only
be
a
cheap
yet
drinkable
and
nonoffensive
brew
and
in
that
capacity
is
succeeds
fully
i
have
drunk
a
lot
of
this
with
dinner
when
i
hit
the
supermarket
deli
for
dinner
and
just
wanted
a
beer
to
go
with
say
fried
chicken
which
is
exactly
why
i
am
even
reviewing
this
brew
here
this
beer
is
one
of
those
beers
that
comes
in
a
can
compared
to
those
other
canned
brews
it
is
on
the
sweeter
maltier
side
of
taste
no
bitterness
there
must
be
a
lot
of
great
ingredients
cause
my
head
is
ringing
now
and
i
didnt
even
drink
that
many
of
these
better
than
some
shitty
macros
worse
than
the
rest
of
the
beers
we
love
transparent
lightest
gold
color
widebubbled
head
of
a
very
thin
character
but
better
duration
than
some
partial
ring
laces
aroma
is
all
sweetness
corn
and
cane
sugar
mouthfeel
is
thinnish
but
the
carbonation
is
adequately
done
no
real
sense
of
hops
malt
is
sweet
and
neutral
without
nasty
qualities
aftertaste
is
lightly
honeyish
without
the
overdone
fizziness
and
mineral
water
taste
of
some
macros
cheap
and
forgetable
but
not
the
worst
of
drinkabilities
in
the
beer
world
i
had
this
beast
out
of
a
40oz
bottle
i
was
drinking
it
during
one
of
radfords
infamous
card
games
that
they
play
to
get
wasted
i
actually
did
get
to
critique
this
beer
so
all
was
not
wasted
the
appearance
wasnt
mind
bending
like
the
wwstout
that
i
divulged
myself
in
earlier
but
it
was
nice
straw
colored
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
smell
was
of
citrusy
and
corn
proportions
the
taste
was
similar
but
not
too
strong
all
in
all
a
good
cheap
one
suffice
it
to
say
that
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
to
be
said
about
this
beer
so
i
am
going
to
get
right
to
my
rating
canit
formed
a
large
white
creamy
sized
head
with
fine
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
with
lively
carbonation
and
the
hue
was
yellow
there
was
not
much
of
a
nose
to
this
beer
other
than
some
malt
notes
the
flavor
was
blah
and
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
smooth
thin
watery
and
light
bodied
this
beer
left
very
little
in
the
way
of
any
lacing
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
lagers
available
at
the
nearest
small
gas
station
drinkable
if
only
just
not
good
enough
for
enthusiasm
not
bad
enough
to
slam
its
beer
drink
it
overall
this
is
almost
drinkable
i
mean
hey
its
an
american
pilsner
a
product
of
pabst
nothing
fancy
nothing
tasty
my
grandfather
lives
by
it
but
what
does
that
mean
it
seems
to
be
a
case
of
product
identity
someday
i
will
make
a
long
line
up
of
all
the
usual
suspects
and
see
just
what
the
difference
is
between
them
all
until
then
i
will
drink
good
beer
not
that
bad
cant
get
much
of
a
head
or
much
smell
clear
yellow
i
can
taste
a
little
malt
grain
and
some
hops

choices
at

my

drinks
margueritas
i
guess
it
could
be
worse
usually
pretty
fresh
and
cold
its
hard
to
blow
sunshine
up
the
ass
of
the
average
cheap
beer
but
old
milwaukee
makes
it
a
little
eaiser
the
mildly
sweet
malt
taste
is
quite
the
delicacy
in
a
512
pack
beer
my
dad
told
me
this
was
the
cheapest
crap
his
fraternity
could
get
we
should
all
be
so
lucky
a

clear
strawgold

by
a

holds
well
its
retention
is
surprisingly
good
and
it
leaves
some
nice
lace
to
boot
the
nose
is
exceptionally
clean
with
just
a
light
touch
of
sweet
malt
the
body
is
light
and
its
crisp
in

a

sweet
malt
makes
up
the

of
the
flavor
coming
on

at
the
start
and
slowly
fading
through
the
swallow
its
quite
clean
and
devoid
of
any
yeast
characteristics
adjunct
is
obviously
being
used
at
a
high
level
as
theres
no
real
grain
character
present
it
finishes
drying
with
a
dollop
of
sweet

receeds

very
well
made

lacking

this
beer
has
only
availability

interestingly
enough
the
can

reads
the

american
beer
festival
1999
gold
medal
winner

this
fact
seems
quite
extraordinary
considering
the
relative
mediocrity
of
this
beer
a
pretty
standard
beer
that
fills
a
niche
carved
out
for
the
macros
by
the
marketing
guys
yellow

standard

drinkable
in
a
crunch
but
not
one
to
be
sought
after
pale
clear
yellow
with
a
weak
head
little
flavor
initially
then
a
some
sweetness
comes
in
id
like
to
say
it
is
malt
but
feels
too
coarse
more
likely
corn
or
some
kind
of
sugar
no
real
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
not
a
bad
cheap
beer
although
there
are
a
few
id
put
ahead
of
it
pretty
much
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
of
cheap
american
lager
this
pours
with
very
little
excitement
the
nose
gets
the
odor
of
corn
and
oats
taste
is
sweet
and
dry
but
with
a
very
grainy
chemical
like
finish
the
malted
cereal
grains
are
the
big
player
in
this
brew
this
is
a
very
cheap
beer
next
time
ill
spend
the
extra
for
pabst
blue
ribbon
pours
a
very
light
golden
with
almost
no
head
has
the
appearance
of
being
flat
which
the
taste
is
quick
to
confirm
after
a
slight
fizzy
mouthfeel
aroma
is
non
descript
and
the
taste
is
weak
not
a
very
good
beer
but
for
the
price
it
is
acceptable
sleemans
did
this
beer
the
best
it
has
probably
ever
been
done
just
as
they
did
blue
ribbon
this
offering
was
a
testament
to
sleemans
qc
and
not
neccesarily
the
original
om
recipe
mouthfeel
is
average
and
it
is
easy
to
guzzle
when
it
is
ice
cold
and
you
want
a
cheap
thrillor
you
are
on
a
strict
budget
like
i
am
right
now
judging
from
reviews
from
less
oppressive
regimes
states
the
added
water
in
the
3
2
version
actually
may
help
the
flavor
this
is
a
cheap
beer
that
tastes
cheap
not
very
pleasing
on
the
palette
whatsoever
in
the
line
of
cheap
beers
pabst
or
strohs
is
probably
the
way
to
go
stay
away
from
this
stuff
poured
this
beer
in
a
glass
and
drank
it
then
the
second
time
i
drank
it
out
of
the
glass
and
it
did
taste
better
only
because
by
the
time
i
drank
it
i
was
feeling
no
pain
the
first
glass
of
this
beer
was
bad
but
a
100
degrees
it
tasted
so
so
if
it
was
under
normal
conditions
id
have
throwed
it
in
the
rose
garden
there
very
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
decent
amount
of
froth
the
head
stuck
around
for
some
time
and
settled
in
at
about
15
of
fine
bubbles
this
was
a
pretty
good
looking
american
lager
fairly
clean
tasting
with
only
a
touch
of
corn
in
the
nose
it
tasted
good
almost
this
was
one
of
the
few
popular
american
lagers
where
the
malt
was
noticeable
crisp
and
clean
that
was
the
theme
of
the
beer
the
only
place
this
beer
was
lacking
was
in
the
hops
very
little
hops
there
was
nothing
that
said
hey
this
is
what
hops
taste
like
instead
the
thought
was
more
like
hmm
this
is
slightly
bitter
but
where
did
it
come
from
in
the
mouth
the
beer
was
quite
pleasant
much
carbonation
at
first
so
i
let
it
sit
for
about
a
minute
while
a
looked
at
it
waiting
for
the
waves
of
rising
bubbles
to
subside
im
glad
i
did
after
a
minute
when
i
tasted
it
there
was
still
much
carbonation
but
rather
being
huge
forced
bubbles
they
were
small
and
prickly
this
was
not
as
watery
as
the
light
version
why
they
evenmake
this
crap
old
milwaukee
must
have
been
some
fouls
smelling
place
for
this
stuff
to
be
named
after
it
another
in
the
line
of
old
man
beers
this
stuff
has
less
of
a
corn
taste
than
its
counterparts
i
rarely
see
this
in
most
stores
just
the
high
volume
macro
vendors
if
not
for
that
unknown
and
unpleasant
chemical
note
old
milwaukee
would
not
be
too
bad
for
a
low
priced
macro
sickly
gold
white
head
minimal
retention
no
lace
lightly
sweet
nose
adjucts
i
assume
harshly
metallic
taste
almost
impossible
to
drink
it
brought
pain
to
my
throat
i
really
cant
tolerate
old
mud
frankly
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
had
please
stay
away
from
it
notes
as
close
to
not
having
much
flavour
at
all
oddly
it
was
not
that
bad
going
down
compared
to
other
cheap
american
lagers
this
is
the
stuff
to
get
when
you
only
have
a
couple
bucks
in
your
pocket
good
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
to
get
the
flavour
of
cheap
lager
and
realize
that
there
are
so
many
great
beers
out
there
other
than
this
this
beer
was
a
pale
yellow
color
and
had
very
little
white
head
and
no
lace
an
aroma
of
grain
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
grain
and
alcohol
the
body
is
extremely
light
and
the
finish
mostly
just
bite
okay
this
has
to
be
the
most
popular
cheap
beer
that
me
and
my
friends
used
to
pickup
and
what
some
of
my
older
friends
still
try
to
bring
over
on
occasion
if
your
going
to
go
cheap
you
might
as
well
pick
this
over
things
like
miller
this
beer
has
a
very
strange
aftertaste
for
some
reason
that
taste
can
best
be
described
as
tin
i
believe
it
interracts
with
the
can
to
form
this
taste
a
watery
beverage
that
to
be
honest
wasnt
that
good
i
think
you
must
be
over
60
to
drink
this
beer
as
that
is
all
i
ever
see
buy
it
in
the
stores
old
mil
has
a
bit
more
body
and
character
than
typical
mass
produced
lagers
it
doesnt
have
that
awful
adjunt
odor
and
has
some
malt
body
and
a
bit
of
restrained
hop
flavor
it
goes
down
well
and
id
rather
drink
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
rather
than
pour
it
into
a
glass
all
that
said
reviewing
american
lagers
is
boring
and
more
time
should
be
spent
pounding
them
rather
than
reviewing
them
so
im
off
to
do
my
duty
mineral
and
salty
with
a
harsh
finish
that
passes
for
hops
tastes
like
some
sort
of
medicine
to
clean
out
your
colon
which
is
does
pretty
effectively
too
overall
pedestrian
but
not
offensive
a
good
lawnmower
beer
gave
it
a
2
5
based
on
nostalgia
only
probably
a
2
0
beer
nothing
at
all
stands
out
kinda
musty
almost
spoiled
tasting
its
like
buying
ocean
pacific
brand
at
walmart
not
real
you
are
paying
for
the
label
only
pretty
typical
adjunct
lager
drink
it
fast
because
the
off
flavors
show
when
it
warms
same
crap
different
can
okay
when
free
piss
beer
texan
pbr
trash
lets
not
kid
anybody
this
isnt
very
good
beer
it
used
to
be
back
in
the
early
70s
but
a
lot
of
things
have
changed
since
then
when
i
can
find
it
and
thats
not
very
often
i
drink
it
because
of
the
nostalgia
effect
i
put
on
some
jerry
jeff
close
my
eyes
and
imagine
myself
40
years
younger
driving
my
56
chevy
sedan
delivery
around
texas
listening
to
am
radio
and
going
into
austin
on
occasion
to
hear
some
good
music
at
the
armadillo
for
that
alone
its
worth
the
price
and
the
hangover
lone
star
its
name
and
also
its
rating
watery
corn
flavor
and
aroma
zero
head
flat
mouthfeel
pretty
bad
the
national
beer
if
texas
a
sweet
lager
with
a
grassy
finish
piss
beer
i
had
to
try
just
because
pbr
bottled
with
a
different
label
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
my
grandpa
might
have
liked
in
boot
camp
back
in
the
40s
that
being
said
its
easy
drinking
for
guys
that
dont
require
much
out
of
their
brew
for
a
basic
goto
americanstyle
lager
lone
star
stands
alone
at
the
top
of
the
list
easily
drinkable
with
a
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
pairs
perfectly
with
brisket
steak
hunting
tailgating
etc
lone
star
wont
be
found
at
the
top
of
most
beer
snobs
lists
but
it
remains
an
excellent
americanstyle
lager
and
holds
a
proud
place
as
a
staple
of
this
texans
fridge
my
friend
brought
this
up
from
texas
for
me
it
was
a
very
average
beer
id
rather
drink
it
than
bud
light
any
day
ok
first
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
state
beer
of
texas
but
its
made
in
california
my
first
sip
and
i
seriously
thought
this
was
diluted
with
water
very
weak
take
your
average
beer
and
then
mix
it
5050
with
water
and
there
you
have
it
lone
star
beer
i
could
not
even
finish
14
of
the
bottle
and
not
wanting
the
waitress
to
get
offended
i
poured
most
of
it
on
my
12
dozen
finished
oyster
shells
and
leftover
bread
to
look
like
i
at
least
drank
most
of
it
would
i
drink
this
if
there
was
nothing
else
sure
but
this
stuff
is
not
really
good
at
all
out
of
all
the
readily
available
adjucts
out
there
i
find
this
one
to
be
the
least
offensive
to
the
senses
im
rating
this
on
style
not
personal
preference
but
actually
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
if
i
go
to
lonestar
steakhouse
for
dinner
thats
usually
what
i
order
even
though
im
a
beer
snob
i
still
have
a
soft
spot
for
an
easy
drinking
american
lager
this
one
fits
the
bill
perfectly
way
underrated
and
millions
of
texans
cant
be
wrong
i
like
this
beer
it
was
never
really
available
for
me
when
i
was
younger
since
i
was
not
living
near
texas
at
all
but
i
have
grown
to
drink
and
love
it
its
cheap
which
is
so
awesome
its
refreshing
which
is
so
awesome
again
its
great
to
drink
all
night
and
all
day
which
is
the
best
awesome
i
get
it
when
i
can
find
it
i
enjoy
it
when
i
get
it
lone
star
is
a
super
star
beer
overall
on
the
positive
side
it
is
cheap
and
no
worse
than
other
mass
produced
beers
the
excessive
sweetness
can
amplify
the
hangover
if
youre
visiting
in
texas
go
for
a
shiner
instead
pours
a
lightmedium
straw
yellow
in
color
with
about
a
half
of
a
finger
white
fizzy
head
that
settles
down
quickly
to
just
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
of
some
basic
grains
nothing
special
really
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
hint
of
sweet
corn
with
a
slight
tart
finish
above
average
carbonation
drinkable
but
once
again
nothing
really
special
be
warned
at
the
end
of
every
sixer
theres
a
monster
o
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
lot
more
drinkability
compared
to
other
adjunct
lagers
as
it
doesnt
have
any
off
flavors
or
skunk
in
the
taste
lone
star
beer
is
a
refreshing
and
relatively
flavorful
american
adjunct
lager
all
in
all
definitely
a
notch
or
two
better
than
most
beers
of
this
style
i
mean
it
is
what
it
is
had
this
at
atlantic
beer
garden
in
boston
its
got
a
sweet
but
musty
smell
to
it
a
little
dull
this
hails
as
the
national
beer
of
texas
come
on
texas
you
can
do
better
than
that
id
probably
rather
go
with
a
pbr
if
this
is
the
genre
of
beer
that
is
called
for
avoid
this
beer
i
had
never
had
this
one
before
and
it
is
not
available
where
i
live
but
on
a
trip
through
an
adjacent
state
i
stopped
to
pick
up
a
few
beers
when
i
noticed
this
store
had
six
packs
of
this
stuff
i
had
listened
to
texas
musicians
and
others
praise
this
stuff
for
so
long
i
had
made
it
a
point
to
try
at
some
time
in
my
life
i
did
not
realize
it
would
be
yesterday
sometimes
when
you
are
not
looking
for
something
it
just
appears
anyway
this
beer
was
alright
nothing
to
sing
about
even
though
people
have
this
is
more
a
novelty
to
me
but
overall
had
it
been
the
middle
of
summer
and
i
was
going
to
listen
to
some
texas
troubadour
sing
about
it
it
would
fit
the
bill
rather
well
anyway
to
the
review
it
smelled
sweet
and
grainy
and
when
i
poured
it
in
the
glass
it
was
a
very
pale
yellow
almost
colorless
really
the
taste
did
have
a
bite
to
it
that
i
wasnt
expecting
but
overall
not
bad
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
grilling
out
and
listening
to
some
good
tunes
like
i
said
before
it
is
what
it
is
but
lone
star
had
a
certain
appeal
which
precipitated
the
purchase
o
average
i
have
not
had
this
in
a
looong
time
glad
to
see
an
old
friend
watching
some
live
spelunky
action
and
downing
some
beers
good
times
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlyfunky
wheat
light
hard
water
and
very
light
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
extra
minerals
in
the
water
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
your
basic
nonlight
adjunct
lager
not
much
to
see
or
taste
here
folks
overall
its
not
something
id
recommend
unless
maybe
youre
scrounging
for
quarters
out
of
the
back
of
your
pickup
truck
o
easy
to
drink
and
pairs
relatively
well
with
the
smokey
flavors
and
spices
of
bbq
could
definitely
be
sessionable
but
would
not
be
my
first
choice
beer
for
it
d
its
an
adjunct
lager
and
it
doesnt
really
do
much
to
differentiate
itself
from
its
competitors
i
was
able
to
finish
the
12oz
can
thanks
to
the
relative
dearth
of
flavor
light
body
and
minimal
alcohol
but
its
not
an
experience
im
dying
to
repeat
o
guess
its
not
totally
fair
since
i
tried
an
expired
bottle
after
trying
100
texas
beers
i
would
say
this
beats
shiners
ruby
redbird
and
thats
about
it
well
worth
the
money
i
spent
being
a
avid
craft
beer
drinker
you
need
to
have
a
beer
that
you
just
have
everyday
this
is
my
beer
just
for
that
purpose
ive
probably
had
every
top
notch
beer
made
in
the
world
but
this
always
sits
in
my
fridge
its
a
good
cheap
beer
that
does
its
job
well
quenching
my
thirst
after
a
long
day
of
work
then
i
will
dig
deeper
into
the
fridge
and
pull
out
something
else
to
sip
on
its
good
for
what
its
worth
a
somewhat
tastier
macro
lager
than
the
run
of
the
mill
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
fizzles
smell
is
beery
for
lack
of
a
better
descriptive
and
the
flavor
is
grainy
as
can
be
ice
cold
it
is
quite
refreshing
i
wouldnt
think
about
it
much
past
that
aroma
is
well
crisp
and
malty
but
lacking
complexity
at
least
it
smells
like
a
beer
albeit
an
industrial
brew
it
pours
a
typical
clear
straw
yellow
not
much
head
flavor
is
meh
a
little
malty
thats
all
ive
had
lite
beers
with
more
flavor
texture
is
fizzy
but
rather
watery
i
had
to
try
it
and
at
least
now
i
know
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
barley
and
corn
are
detectable
and
typical
of
the
adjunct
lager
taste
the
hop
flavor
is
mild
the
body
is
light
with
plentiful
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
its
unoffensive
and
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
do
a
shot
of
whiskey
with
a
16oz
ice
cold
lone
star
chaser
works
for
me
1001

blog
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
overall
drinkability
goes
perfectly
well
with
bbq
on
a
hot
day
which
is
how
i
had
it
in
santa
fe
light
bodied
plenty
of
carbonation
not
much
aftertaste
not
the
best
or
worst
adjunct
lager
i
have
tried
nothing
to
get
to
excited
about
either
the
taste
followed
the
aroma
flat
watery
and
lukewarm
this
cup
was
like
one
of
prousts
madeleines
taking
me
back
my
first
encounter
with
beer
a
keg
of
this
at
a
family
reunion
as
a
gradeschooler
in
the
late
70s
some
things
havent
changed
o
yeah
its
cheap
macro
beer
but
while
in
texas
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
hits
the
spot
when
its
cold
its
refreshing
and
light
enough
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
a
good
everyday
sort
of
beer
that
you
dont
have
to
think
about
just
enjoy
it
o
overall
glad
to
have
another
beer
under
my
belt
but
would
not
seek
this
out
again
not
the
worst
beer
ever
drank
but
slightly
under
the
middle
line
take
any
weak
bmc
and
put
a
texasproud
label
on
it
and
there
you
go
lone
star
beer
poured
a
3
white
soap
suds
head
which
faded
fast
standard
clear
pale
straw
yellow
color
almost
no
smell
or
taste
but
i
suppose
you
could
say
it
has
a
very
weak
grassiness
to
it
about
as
watery
as
they
come
everything
is
big
in
texas
except
this
beer
carbonation
is
pretty
high
for
the
style
very
prickly
starts
off
pretty
sweet
and
with
a
definite
presence
of
corn
fades
into
a
finish
with
a
vegetal
taste
and
a
little
bit
of
grain
helping
to
end
the
beer
nothing
amazing
but
as
others
have
noted
it
does
have
a
pabstlike
flavor
this
makes
it
better
than
most
adjunct
lagers
but
nothing
exciting
drink
it
cold
for
as
it
warms
up
the
flavor
what
little
there
is
to
speak
of
drops
off
completely
as
mentioned
lone
star
is
my
goto
bar
beer
if
im
feeling
frugal
other
than
that
i
typically
dont
drink
it
but
that
by
no
means
should
mean
its
a
bad
beer
just
no
where
close
to
be
the
best
most
exciting
beer
youll
ever
have
as
for
the
advertisements
of
this
being
the
beer
of
texas
ive
never
actually
seen
a
texan
drink
this
at
least
not
in
the
panhandle
where
the
beer
of
up
here
is
usually
coors
light
or
shiner
6
pack
of
bottles
was
5
99
very
hard
to
find
here
but
worth
a
try
verdict
im
sad
to
say
it
but
lone
star
is
a
pisspoor
representation
of
texas
beer
its
has
a
bit
more
malt
bite
than
most
of
its
competition
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
just
another
in
a
sea
of
faceless
beers
in
this
style
o
d
well
its
better
than
i
expected
i
dont
think
its
very
good
attempting
to
review
to
style
why
is
lone
star
made
in
illinois
these
days
one
finger
head
of
pure
white
dense
foam
which
lasted
less
than
a
minute
leaving
a
few
bits
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
color
is
a
3
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
clear
with
lots
of
micro
bubble
action
smell
is
of
cereal
grain
and
that
is
about
it
taste
is
not
much
there
flavors
of
corn
wheat
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
almost
water
save
the
zing
from
loads
of
carbonation
cheap
beer
for
days
working
in
the
yard
but
there
are
a
lot
of
those
with
more
flavor
and
less
cost
smells
like
sweet
corn
and
grain
however
sweetness
does
not
jump
out
of
the
taste
it
has
high
carbonation
it
tastes
like
really
cheap
bread
it
has
an
interesting
bitter
taste
that
is
refreshingly
different
from
the
corn
sweetness
in
most
beers
of
this
type
but
still
it
mostly
just
tastes
like
a
mouthful
of
soggy
offbrand
bread
overall
drinkability
this
beer
has
no
redeeming
qualities
other
than
the
fact
that
it
tastes
like
water
and
it
is
conceivable
that
someone
might
want
to
get
drunk
while
drinking
water
so
this
would
be
the
solution
to
that
need
pours
a
piss
yellow
with
a
decent
amount
of
pure
white
head
the
frothy
head
hangs
around
forever
smells
pretty
bland
some
light
maltiness
and
sweetness
but
no
other
smells
tastes
blah
not
awful
but
really
nothing
to
say
its
a
bit
thin
and
the
corn
is
prominent
but
its
fairly
decent
overall
for
the
style
i
had
to
try
this
at
some
point
now
that
i
live
in
texas
it
pretty
much
lived
up
to
its
reputation
which
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
i
guess
its
greatest
assest
is
as
somebody
else
already
said
its
not
an
annoying
beer
drink
1
or
6
and
well
it
works
well
enough
to
quench
your
thirst
mediocre
it
offers
no
redeeming
value
and
it
will
take
you
an
entire
6
pack
to
feel
a
buzz
lame
lone
star
is
a
yellowish
brew
with
a
little
white
head
the
aroma
to
the
extent
that
you
can
detect
it
is
sweet
with
adjunct
more
of
the
same
on
the
light
bodied
palate
i
believe
corn
is
the
culprit
here
very
little
bitterness
to
counteract
the
sweetness
as
i
drink
more
the
sweet
residue
builds
producing
almost
a
syruplike
coating
of
the
mouth
cloying
appropriately
sums
this
one
up
as
a
texas
i
want
to
point
out
that
lone
star
even
gets
a
bad
rap
in
the
lone
star
state
snobbishly
looked
down
upon
by
texans
who
prefer
bud
and
miller
which
i
find
pretty
hilarious
i
started
drinking
lone
star
in
high
school
mostly
due
to
its
low
price
at
the
time
and
it
has
become
sort
of
a
comfort
beer
for
me
i
know
its
not
the
best
beer
on
the
market
but
if
you
want
a
cold
one
while
mowing
the
yard
in
100
degree
texas
summers
or
to
wash
down
brisket
at
a
backyard
barbecue
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
lone
star
lone
dtar
beer
is
another
favorite
of
mine
besides
the
little
puzzles
on
the
bottom
of
each
bottle
cap
the
beer
isnt
that
bad
i
was
surprised
that
it
is
made
by
pabst
brewing
lone
star
has
to
be
the
best
beer
from
this
brewery
atleast
by
what
ive
had
the
smell
is
not
impressive
but
it
is
easily
drinkabe
you
can
have
quit
a
few
without
being
annoyed
by
it
at
has
a
little
bitter
bite
toward
the
end
of
a
drink
it
tastes
slightly
hoppy
and
grainy
it
is
a
step
above
bud
light
and
coors
light
pretty
good
dud
sud
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
little
head
which
dissipates
quickly
lacing
doesnt
stick
around
long
either
odor
is
faint
but
comes
across
as
dry
and
grainy
tastes
like
watery
grains
with
a
very
slight
hop
bitterness
not
the
worst
brew
ive
ever
had
but
far
from
the
best
not
a
bad
looking
beer
not
something
to
write
home
about
but
not
bad
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
moment
no
lacing
smells
of
corn
and
grass
and
a
little
grain
tastes
of
corn
and
sweet
malts
a
little
hops
and
some
simple
syrup
or
something
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
drinkability
is
pretty
average
too
this
beer
is
incredibly
average
at
every
level
except
i
thought
it
was
an
excellent
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
alright
it
is
a
bit
grassy
grainy
and
a
little
adjunct
but
no
worse
than
other
beers
in
this
category
it
has
a
brass
colored
body
with
good
carbonation
a
good
white
head
and
a
little
above
average
head
the
flavor
is
mild
and
reminds
me
of
the
aroma
with
some
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
way
too
carbonated
drinks
ok
i
guess
overall
i
was
expecting
something
of
a
surprise
when
i
initially
bought
this
became
disappointed
after
i
learned
pabst
brews
this
then
was
surprised
again
when
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
initially
thought
after
learning
this
was
from
pabst
overall
it
was
just
another
in
a
lone
of
light
lagers
that
just
lack
depth
and
profile
not
terrible
just
uninteresting
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
crisp
with
very
high
and
champagnelike
carbonation
and
an
extremely
light
body
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
its
watery
and
kind
of
boring
and
overall
an
ok
beer
thats
just
very
dull
i
usually
drink
this
straight
out
of
a
16oz
can
which
is
the
best
way
to
have
it
in
my
opinion
it
does
not
really
matter
how
you
drink
it
it
still
wont
taste
good
for
some
oddball
reason
i
tend
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
whenever
im
in
texas
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
notes
of
corn
taste
is
very
mild
almost
nothing
to
this
beer
maybe
a
touch
of
malts
and
corn
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
other
than
for
drinking
games
this
is
a
miss
mouthfeel
is
a
smooth
light
body
that
finishes
clean
this
is
a
beer
for
hot
weather
not
just
warm
weather
hot
weather
im
talking
about
a
heat
index
over
100
degrees
drinkability
this
is
not
bad
at
all
for
a
semimacro
beer
theres
nothing
offensive
in
here
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
most
aals
and
everything
is
in
balance
nice
to
finally
get
this
here
in
socal
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
lets
be
honest
they
arent
trying
to
be
the
next
hop
bomb
or
coffeee
stout
it
is
what
it
is
a
simple
american
lager
i
recommend
getting
these
in
cans
and
serving
them
extremely
cold
great
beer
for
after
mowing
the
lawn
fuller
bodied
than
i
expected
with
a
subtle
dry
hop
presence
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
over
the
pale
malt
and
sweet
grainy
corn
notes
into
a
long
mettalic
dry
finish
this
beer
is
about
what
i
expected
except
fir
mouthfeel
and
since
its
95
degrees
here
today
i
ws
able
to
pound
this
down
pretty
quickly
rjt
had
this
beer
in
the
great
state
of
texas
the
appearance
is
pale
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
not
bad
for
an
adjunct
lager
but
not
really
noticeable
what
stands
out
about
this
beer
is
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
lone
star
is
my
favorite
session
beer
and
thats
all
that
i
expect
from
it
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
the
can
had
homages
to
stephen
f
austin
william
b
travis
the
alamo
and
the
words
since
1845
it
also
read
texas
born
brewed
d
very
bad
to
drink
maybe
if
you
accompany
any
snack
with
it
should
be
fine
md
goes
down
about
cheap
vodka
come
to
think
about
it
its
as
drinkable
as
9
dollar
handles
of
vodka
at
the
grocery
store
bottle
pale
pae
sparkling
gold
with
a
short
lived
white
fizz
very
faint
aroma
of
pale
malt
and
wet
paper
a
whiff
of
grains
slightly
sweet
grain
and
vegetal
flavour
with
strange
bitterness
and
watery
palate
not
offensive
just
doesnt
smell
or
taste
like
much
because
nothing
says
texas
like
wisconsin
thanks
david
for
the
bottle
ordered
a
bottle
with
a
bbq
brisket
sandwich
at
soulfire
bbq
in
allston
poured
into
a
pint
glass
clear
yellow
color
fizzy
body
soapy
head
that
quickly
vanishes
some
lacing
on
the
glass
though
smelled
a
bit
skunky
tasted
was
straight
up
macro
loads
of
corn
and
other
adjuncts
kind
of
unappealing
on
the
palate
tastes
like
nothing
so
its
only
slightly
more
easyenjoyable
to
drink
than
water
this
is
what
you
get
from
a
3
bottle
of
beer
from
texas
i
guess
had
a
bottle
of
this
in
gruene
tx
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
dark
yellow
with
little
white
head
or
lacing
very
grainy
nose
mouthfeel
and
taste
short
nondescript
finish
that
left
me
thirsty
but
not
for
more
this
beer
really
was
not
very
good
and
i
plan
to
avoid
it
in
the
future
this
is
a
below
average
beer
can
be
refreshing
after
long
day
of
yard
work
appearance
is
dismal
yellow
and
unimpressive
head
nonexistent
the
bottle
is
where
this
should
be
drunk
from
it
improves
the
appearance
greatly
the
national
beer
of
texas
the
smell
is
grainy
if
your
lucky
and
skunkish
if
not
the
taste
is
similar
but
of
corn
and
sweet
with
little
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
with
okay
carbonation
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
better
american
adjuncts
grain
belt
premium
pabst
and
schlit
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
d
i
just
nailed
3
of
these
during
the
usc
game
and
was
quite
satisfied
low
abv
plus
great
food
and
beer
salt
make
this
very
drinkable
ill
be
done
with
the
sixer
before
the
4th
this
beer
tastes
like
a
mix
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
and
a
malt
liquour
it
has
the
normal
pale
yellow
color
tinny
smell
and
watery
mouthfeel
it
is
really
only
worth
drinking
once
since
it
is
the
national
beer
of
texas
but
it
does
not
taste
very
good
and
is
not
worth
pouring
into
a
glass
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
bland
with
metalic
undertones
not
my
favorite
beer
for
sure
as
a
beer
this
is
a
macrolager
there
is
nothing
worth
reporting
on
this
other
than
that
if
you
are
faced
with
the
choice
of
this
or
a
bmc
flip
a
coin
because
it
does
not
matter
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
but
not
even
as
good
as
from
the
bottle
its
pretty
crisp
with
some
smoothness
its
very
thin
and
watery
body
is
very
light
wow
that
is
pretty
damn
watery
does
not
taste
like
much
at
all
nearly
like
a
sparkling
water
with
a
very
mild
grain
characteristic
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
while
this
beer
is
not
really
that
offensive
when
served
very
cold
it
does
very
little
for
anyone
with
an
appreciation
for
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
thin
fizzy
body
this
beer
is
crisp
and
clean
and
boring
this
is
bmc
by
another
name
pours
a
yellowish
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
smells
like
rice
and
corn
tastes
clean
at
first
goes
down
fairly
easy
its
very
carbonated
the
faint
flavor
of
grains
comes
through
as
it
warms
its
not
offensive
but
who
cares
this
is
better
in
the
bottle
still
at
1
50
a
pint
i
cant
blame
it
for
being
what
it
is
good
enough
value
beer
edited
to
increase
drinkability
score
this
stuff
does
go
down
like
water
now
i
know
why
i
never
sampled
lone
star
from
a
pint
glass
before
this
review
the
saving
grace
of
this
beer
is
the
price
and
ultimately
the
picture
puzzles
beneath
each
cap
lone
star
winning
2
gold
medals
at
gabf
is
beyond
me
enjoyed
it
and
i
will
buy
it
again
d
ouch
this
was
one
of
only
three
texas
beers
i
could
find
near
bush
airport
in
houston
the
hotel
bar
had
it
on
tap
for
6
00
6
00
for
lone
star
are
these
people
nuts
the
convenience
store
across
the
street
however
had
a
bunch
of
single
16oz
cans
for
a
much
more
realistic
price
so
i
grabbed
one
not
my
wisest
investment
even
the
special
limited
edition
can
didnt
help
had
a
case
this
past
weekend
now
lone
star
comes
with
a
red
pull
tab
with
a
little
white
texas
star
on
it
how
cool
is
that
haha
this
beer
really
isnt
half
bad
i
guess
its
fresh
cause
the
cans
are
new
maybe
lone
star
will
keep
up
the
good
work
drinkability
for
the
style
i
think
this
is
highly
drinkablecertainly
better
that
coors
miller
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
which
made
this
stand
out
on
my
own
scale
i
would
give
this
a
dc
it
is
however
an
above
average
adjunct
lager
i
could
certainly
drink
six
or
more
if
i
was
in
a
macro
drinking
mood
being
from
the
capital
city
in
texas
lone
star
is
around
everywhere
and
for
the
most
part
can
be
found
for
5
99
a
six
pack
alot
of
times
4
99
all
of
my
friends
drink
it
in
mass
quantities
because
they
are
not
beer
snobs
like
me
also
it
is
way
cheap
and
tastes
way
better
than
other
beers
of
its
price
range
busch
bud
coors
pbr
all
those
types
also
its
claim
to
texas
heritage
gives
it
another
flavor
that
most
outside
of
texas
could
not
describe
however
since
the
company
got
bought
a
few
years
ago
by
pabst
it
has
lost
most
of
that
appeal
and
i
myself
feel
as
if
i
have
lost
almost
every
attachment
to
this
beer
because
of
it
corporate
america
claims
another
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
weak
and
watery
pilsner
malt
and
adjunct
scent
with
little
trace
of
hops
anywhere
the
taste
is
less
than
desirable
its
an
adjunct
loaded
beer
thats
crisp
and
clean
and
devoid
of
any
character
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
too
much
co2
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
nothing
special
had
a
couple
while
waiting
around
for
a
table
at
a
restaurant
last
night
clear
and
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
whaddya
know
its
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
not
a
lot
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
isnt
offensive
this
beer
is
fizzy
and
refreshing
makes
its
name
for
being
very
cheap
and
very
drinkable
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
a
beer
like
this
it
is
what
it
is
pours
an
extremely
fizzy
but
extremely
diminishing
white
head
like
a
soda
body
is
a
very
clear
amber
yellow
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
fruity
sweet
roma
some
vegetable
too
lots
of
malts
not
very
appealing
some
skunky
sourness
present
too
malty
nutty
crisp
taste
not
too
bad
pretty
refreshing
very
malty
nuttiness
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
that
would
probably
be
much
better
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
i
appreciate
the
brand
association
with
willie
nelson
during
the
70s
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
an
average
brew
taste
sour
and
stale
not
pleasant
at
all
served
icecold
which
didnt
help
mask
the
taste
no
aftertaste
and
very
light
i
will
stick
with
the
other
american
lager
standards
in
the
future
surprisingly
serviceable
atmosphere
and
a
more
complex
flavor
than
i
anticipated
given
the
price
okay
feel
but
solid
drinkability
just
terrible
smells
old
tastes
flat
pours
a
darker
yellow
with
a
short
bubbly
head
aroma
of
corn
and
dirt
not
earth
dirt
taste
is
sour
and
bitter
very
metallic
and
old
i
only
knew
one
guy
that
loved
this
beer
he
was
from
corsicana
tx
i
later
found
out
this
was
a
dry
town
possibly
to
keep
this
beer
away
a
local
favorite
lone
star
is
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
cant
touch
the
drinkability
or
flavor
of
the
similar
nonlights
heineken
becks
or
shiner
99
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
12
finger
white
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
kind
of
sweet
the
flavor
has
an
ok
malt
base
to
it
with
no
hops
flavor
i
would
much
prefer
this
beer
to
a
bud
or
others
but
still
hard
for
me
to
consume
mouthfeel
seems
way
undercarbonated
and
not
the
smoothest
of
beers
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
but
my
taste
buds
would
certainly
hold
me
back
very
cheap
beer
i
buy
6pack
of
24
oz
cans
for
3
88
d
not
offensive
but
there
are
definitely
better
macro
options
out
there
these
are
readily
available
all
over
the
lone
star
state
is
it
a
worthy
flag
bearer
of
texas
well
out
of
the
can
this
one
poured
a
bleached
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
minimal
retention
or
lacing
the
nose
was
cereal
malt
and
pale
malt
with
some
lemony
sourness
the
flavors
were
washed
out
and
similar
mostly
pale
malt
with
some
lemon
from
the
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
butter
watery
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
getting
wasted
at
the
lake
kinda
beer
and
nothing
more
lets
be
honest
its
really
pabst
in
the
south
love
it
or
hate
it
texas
deserves
a
better
brew
uses
id
probably
sell
this
beer
to
minors
to
teach
them
that
underage
drinking
is
bad
this
is
a
local
staple
here
in
san
antonio
and
as
such
it
is
cheap
and
readily
available
i
prefer
other
light
style
beers
but
lone
star
can
do
in
a
pinch
and
did
in
this
case
not
a
bad
value
for
your
money
not
much
to
report
not
a
horrible
beer
one
good
for
summer
afternoons
i
had
one
several
years
ago
in
texas
at
the
big
texan
steakhouse
overall
good
id
buy
it
again
but
not
for
15
also
there
are
some
writings
on
the
bottle
caps
drinkability
could
possibly
be
tolerable
but
im
definitely
not
digging
that
sour
lemon
taste
d
drinkability
was
unimpressing
a
struggle
to
finish
and
enjoy
one
sample
let
alone
multiples
would
give
this
a
big
texas
pass
sorry
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
straw
color
with
loose
sudsy
pure
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
sparse
cap
its
lighter
than
most
macros
the
aroma
faint
grainy
and
a
corn
like
sweetness
the
taste
is
of
grain
artificial
sweetner
adjuncts
are
very
noticable
but
the
hops
are
not
typical
macro
stuff
here
doesnt
really
stand
out
not
that
most
do
the
feel
is
light
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
neutral
perhaps
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
i
drank
it
when
cold
so
the
drinkability
was
fine
wouldnt
recommend
letting
it
warm
overall
an
ok
macro
it
doesnt
unseat
the
high
life
overall
if
i
lived
in
texas
i
might
get
it
every
so
often
for
tasks
that
require
cheap
beer
not
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
but
far
from
the
best
i
would
rate
this
at
par
with
miller
high
life
or
coors
even
though
where
i
get
it
usually
in
24oz
cans
it
sells
for
about
half
the
price
if
you
are
low
on
cash
and
want
a
buzz
go
for
it
just
make
sure
its
ice
cold
somehow
it
tastes
slightly
better
in
cans
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
is
decent
slightly
crisp
drinkability
is
low
due
to
its
blandness
and
lack
of
flavor
overall
its
not
a
good
beer
how
could
i
go
to
texas
and
not
at
least
try
lone
star
it
met
my
expectations
in
that
it
really
wasnt
that
good
it
was
a
fairly
typical
macro
lager
it
poured
a
starcolored
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
smell
was
light
a
bit
of
malt
some
corn
and
that
was
about
it
taste
followed
suit
a
bit
of
malts
corn
adjuncts
most
likely
and
that
was
about
it
maybe
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
but
not
much
more
it
was
clean
and
crisp
to
drink
though
and
went
down
very
smoothly
still
i
wouldnt
exactly
recommend
drinking
this
though
youll
find
there
are
some
places
where
it
really
is
your
only
option
this
beer
poured
a
yellowish
straw
color
with
very
little
head
the
smell
was
very
subtle
and
hard
to
pin
down
perhaps
some
malts
the
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
bit
of
hops
towards
the
end
and
an
aftertaste
that
reminds
me
very
much
of
malt
liquor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
not
offensive
as
far
as
a
cheap
beer
goes
this
seems
to
be
pretty
drinkable
beer
im
not
sure
id
ever
choose
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
turn
it
down
whether
you
love
it
or
hate
it
this
one
always
has
a
home
in
my
fridge
to
help
through
the
hot
texas
summers
slight
metallic
bitter
smell
and
similar
taste
except
watered
down
too
maybe
some
corn
too
a
very
generic
beer
without
anything
special
going
for
it
medium
to
high
carbonation
and
somewhat
refreshing
ice
cold
but
not
a
great
beer
tastewise
obviously
and
most
people
over
21
wont
want
this
unless
theyre
on
a
budget
a
very
very
strict
budget
like
any
good
macro
this
beer
isnt
inherently
offensive
it
doesnt
really
resemble
beer
but
it
was
sweet
and
smooth
enough
the
flavor
just
tasted
like
maltinfused
water
in
that
it
had
a
bland
sweetness
that
didnt
taste
like
any
grains
in
particular
i
kept
trying
to
pull
more
flavors
out
of
it
but
it
was
to
no
avail
will
say
however
that
if
i
was
in
texas
on
a
hot
day
and
someone
handed
me
a
lone
star
id
drink
it
no
reason
to
drink
this
as
there
are
many
equally
dull
beers
around
i
grew
up
drinking
lone
star
as
a
kid
back
in
san
antone
back
then
it
was
locally
owned
locally
brewed
and
a
superior
product
to
the
current
edition
i
still
like
the
smell
and
the
after
taste
of
lone
star
but
overall
its
just
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
i
had
a
friend
come
into
town
and
bring
me
a
case
of
long
neck
bottles
ill
certainly
drink
them
all
probably
with
chili
and
or
barbecue
its
not
my
favorite
drink
anymore
but
it
still
reminds
me
of
home
this
is
still
a
pretty
good
session
brew
lower
in
alcohol
than
a
lot
of
other
lagers
this
beer
is
a
pale
yellowgold
color
with
a
thin
and
shortlasting
white
head
specks
of
lacing
on
the
glass
mild
aroma
of
hops
and
grainy
malt
lightbodied
with
an
unappealing
flavor
profile
of
grain
corn
and
weak
hops
the
finish
is
moderately
bitter
and
not
very
flavorful
slight
lingering
grain
flavor
overall
this
beer
doesnt
know
when
to
fold
em
drinkability
it
would
be
easy
to
chug
a
sixer
in
under
an
hour
been
there
done
that
but
i
am
not
proud
of
it
or
anything
i
dont
buy
this
type
of
beer
anymore
but
i
would
reach
for
it
every
time
over
any
of
the
big
3
i
guess
it
is
technically
the
big
2
now
anyday
it
is
an
easy
drinking
macro
but
i
just
dont
desire
that
type
of
thing
drinkability
if
you
have
to
drink
lone
star
for
some
reason
drink
it
out
of
the
bottle
and
not
from
a
glass
you
dont
want
to
waste
your
time
scrubbing
the
hell
out
of
your
glass
to
get
this
beer
out
of
your
life
this
is
clearly
an
example
of
the
saying
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
for
about
4
a
six
pack
youre
not
getting
much
this
one
surprised
me
i
had
5
beers
in
my
make
your
own
6er
and
eyed
the
shelf
looking
for
something
i
hadnt
tried
this
one
jumped
out
and
i
stuck
it
in
the
6th
slot
i
had
little
hope
it
would
be
much
of
anything
but
i
was
surprised
a
bit
better
than
expected
as
macros
go
pabst
is
one
that
has
a
little
bit
more
drinkability
than
others
so
its
no
surprise
that
this
reminded
me
of
its
less
expensive
brother
in
terms
of
taste
or
lack
thereof
and
complexity
or
lack
thereof
no
the
gold
color
the
moderate
head
the
thin
to
moderate
body
and
the
bubbles
all
said
bland
when
i
saw
it
but
it
actually
tasted
a
bit
better
than
that
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
more
substantive
than
i
thought
it
would
be
all
malt
all
the
time
and
some
great
texas
water
i
assue
but
one
of
those
beers
you
could
enjoy
to
wash
down
bbq
and
go
right
back
for
another
and
another
very
smooth
and
unpretentious
and
sometimes
thats
what
you
want
in
a
beer
the
taste
is
nothing
special
big
surprise
weak
malt
character
thats
mostly
sweet
and
sticky
hop
character
is
very
subdued
theres
just
some
slight
tartness
that
weakens
the
sweetness
a
tad
but
not
enough
for
my
liking
blah
once
is
enough
for
this
one
cant
recommend
described
to
me
as
the
national
beer
of
texas
by
the
bartender
not
everything
is
bigger
in
texas
drinks
pretty
easy
i
could
23
on
a
warm
day
way
better
than
bmc
a
pleasant
suprise
went
well
with
my
chopped
beef
bbq
sandwich
jalapeno
even
in
style
this
is
pretty
bad
though
not
the
worst
still
why
bother
d
not
so
good
as
far
as
inexpensive
american
lagers
go
id
rather
have
a
stag

pbr
cheap

maybe
ive
tasted
better
from
pabst
this
was
not
good
overall
a
typical
and
unremarkable
macro
not
much
else
to
say
here
drinkability
ehhhh
didnt
want
another
drinkability
an
easy
drinker
by
far
its
just
a
bit
too
boring
for
me
though
had
this
in
a
bottle
today
at
joe
tejas
in
nj
this
ber
looks
like
its
probably
going
to
get
a
better
score
out
of
me
than
it
really
deserves
heres
the
thing
theres
nothing
to
it
it
smells
like
a
very
light
beer
it
astes
like
a
very
light
beer
theres
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
not
much
in
terms
fo
the
head
a
very
basic
nose
it
goe
down
really
easy
and
is
super
drinkable
id
ather
have
this
than
a
bud
if
youre
in
the
market
for
that
sort
of
a
beerbut
here
was
nothing
bad
or
offensive
about
it
it
just
doesnt
have
anything
gret
about
it
either
drinkability
nothing
about
this
beer
makes
this
unique
versus
other
macro
lagers
personally
i
did
not
enjoy
it
but
i
am
sure
all
the
texas
marketing
makes
this
popular
in
the
lone
star
state
this
was
actually
slightly
better
than
what
i
expected
its
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
im
sure
they
get
lots
of
sales
due
to
the
big
can
im
reasonably
sure
this
is
contract
brewed
in
canada
somewhere
forgot
to
check
the
can
possibly
great
western
who
does
pbr
and
olympia
around
here
possibly
sleeman
who
does
it
out
east
and
would
more
likely
have
the
canning
line
for
these
710ml
brutes
id
drink
this
again
but
i
wont
be
running
out
the
door
to
get
some
good
american
lager
not
great
not
awfull
fairly
cheap
clean
aftertaste
not
as
bad
as
many
people
think
it
is
worth
its
price
the
most
intresting
part
is
how
many
times
the
bottle
mentions
texas
dont
mess
with
texas

is
the
only
beer
i
buy
in
a
can
it
is
dirt
cheap
here
in
the
lone
star
state
and
is
my
everyday
beer
it
is
a
great
thirst
quincher
and
good
with
a
meal
it
is
the
water
of
my
beers
i
always
pour
into
a
glass
as
i
cannot
be
reduced
to
complete
beer
barbarism
it
pours
a
one
finger
head
that
speeds
away
in
two
minutes
it
is
a
medium
yellow
that
leaves
the
faintest
hints
of
lace
on
a
glass
giving
away
its
cheap
manufacture
with
a
healthy
dose
of
corn
sugar
i
enjoy
a
grainy
flavor
in
any
beer
and
that
is
fortunate
because
that
is
about
all
that
can
be
detected
in
the
taste
and
aroma
of
a
lone
star
there
is
an
ample
amount
of
carbonation
but
light
on
the
malt
which
is
why
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
long
after
poured
this
is
about
as
predictably
macro
in
its
characteristics
as
can
be
expected
but
there
is
nothing
unpleasant
here
i
found
a
case
on
a
bench
with
this
brew
after
borrowing
one
and
at

a

and
if
that
is
so

this
wasnt

the

also
goes

a

no

with

overall
i
actually
liked
this

as
i
never

it
before
refreshing
and
would
be
even
better
for
the
warmer
months
served
in
a

i
was
raised
on
the
southside
of
chicago
in

school
in

this
was
the
brew
i
didnt
know
any

and
i
loved
it
nothing

on

day
than
one
of
those
ice
cold
little
round
bottles
dare
to
dream
now
im
old
and
can
afford
better

and
i
buy
better
beer
every
now
and
then
i
have
an
old

im

cheap
nasty
mass
produced
tasteless
american
swill
beer
in
a
bottle
when
you
can
only
afford
cans
just
awful
for
me
it
was
easily
the
very
worst
of
the
ultra
lowend
beers
smells
like
overly
sweet
corn
and
has
a
very
sugary
and
unbalanced
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
us
the
best
thing
it
has
the
look
of
the
beer
is
pretty
good
for
the
styleno
pun
intended
the
main
reason
i
enjoy
this
beer
is
the
location
and
circumstance
under
which
i
am
drinking
it
it
is
almost
always
in
chicago
at
wrigley
field
how
could
you
not
enjoy
almost
any
beer
on
a
nice
day
at
wrigley
so
yeah
the
beer
isnt
that
great
but
the
beer
and
the
experience
together
take
it
up
a
couple
notches
july
at
wrigley
field
thats
what
this
beer
is
for
real
though
one
of
my
favorite
aal
out
there
it
is
no
better
or
worse
than
you
will
expect
nothing
special
cheap
beer
but
better
that
bud
light
and
coors
light
by
far
tight
budget
get
old
style
overall
i
didnt
think
pouring
this
one
would
help
much
but
it
actually
did
i
cant
speak
for
others
but
old
style
is
one
of
my
top
favorite
lagers
bar
none
its
miles
above
pbr
and
rivals
my
current
favorite
hauenstein
these
beers
are
both
cheap
hauenstein
and
old
style
and
i
cant
imagine
finding
a
better
lager
for
the
price
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
beer
if
you
can
find
it
given
the
price
and
the
ubiquity
of
this
brand
you
cant
expect
the
style
and
complexity
of
craft
beers
yet
old
style
is
a
healthier
heavierbody
brew
not
too
watery
not
too
grainy
and
not
too
reliant
on
one
particular
bitter
or
unappetizing
flavor
it
has
a
light
drinkability
to
it
and
favorable
qualities
that
make
it
a
solid
beer
all
around
overall
35
i
tried
this
because
it
was
one
of
my
grandpas
favorites
and
i
grew
up
new
chicago
so
i
figured
i
had
to
by
mere
association
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
feel
the
need
to
ever
have
one
again
overall
old
style
is
good
lager
with
more
taste
then
85
percent
of
lagers
on
market
old
style
beats
out
high
life
modello
bud
ice
busch
natural
ice
and
all
of
light
beers
on
the
market
the
good
news
is
that
pabst
has
been
recently
floated
on
the
market
march
2014
and
it
is
hoped
that
a
new
buyer
will
bring
better
stewardship
to
old
style
and
the
dozens
of
other
brands
that
fall
under
the
pabst
banner
the
color
was
the
standard
pale
straw
the
smell
was
pretty
standard
as
well
it
didnt
smell
bad
it
just
smelled
like
your
granddads
beer
he
kept
out
in
the
garage
grainy
malty
ah
brings
me
back
on
so
many
levels
the
taste
was
great
i
like
this
style
of
beer
and
i
wish
that
other
companies
could
get
this
down
it
tastes
like
a
beer
should
taste
like
this
is
beer
not
an
ale
i
know
we
can
discuss
semantics
all
you
want
but
this
is
what
reminds
me
of
what
i
was
introduced
to
as
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
much
better
than
highlife
and
beers
like
that
for
the
price
tho
would
rather
drink
yuengling
yep
the
best
beer
to
me
is
old
style
beer
i
keep
it
in
the
family
my
grandfather
on
my
moms
side
use
to
drink
old
style
when
i
was
growing
up
my
uncles
to
then
as
i
got
old
enough
to
drink
beer
ive
always
new
i
would
be
drinking
this
great
beer
its
funny
when
i
started
hanging
out
with
new
friends
when
i
moved
to
my
grandparents
neighborhood
those
friends
were
drinking
old
style
to
reach
for
the
best
beer
old
style
beer
i
was
mainly
brewed
in
la
cross
wisconsin
and
then
semi
loads
to
chicago
and
the
suburbs
outside
chicago
old
style
every
where
back
then
and
now
i
live
in
southern
illinois
right
outside
of
st
louis
missouri
and
its
very
hard
to
find
it
anywhere
and
then
when
you
do
find
it
your
paying
an
arm
an
a
leg
crazyly
high
price
is
there
any
where
in
the
st
louis
area
i
can
by
it
cheapter
then
dierbergs
grocery
store
in
edwardsville
illinois
so
damn
high
there
for
a
12
pack
of
bottles
they
higherd
the
12
pack
price
3x
this
year
im
a
big
fan
of
craft
beers
wheat
beers
are
my
favorite
and
like
to
grab
an
ipa
on
occasion
when
im
on
a
tight
budget
i
turn
to
old
style
or
rolling
rock
only
macro
beers
i
remotely
respect
lot
of
my
friends
like
coors
lite
bud
lite
busch
lite
idk
how
they
enjoy
them
anyway
old
style
is
smooth
crisp
far
from
unpleasant
and
the
only
beer
i
can
drink
out
a
can
it
smell
and
appearence
are
nothing
special
but
it
got
a
smooth
mouthfeel
n
nice
taste
ur
ever
low
on
finances
check
it
out
not
bad
and
it
gives
u
your
moneys
worth
o
this
beer
goes
down
easily
and
seems
to
be
a
slight
cut
above
the
common
adjunct
lagers
o
the
one
good
thing
about
the
rust
belt
breweries
is
that
they
actually
have
a
little
flavor
this
one
didnt
taste
as
good
as
the
last
one
but
my
last
one
was
at
wrigley
watching
the
reds
shutout
the
cubs
that
one
tasted
sweet
and
old
style
is
just
that
one
or
two
is
ok
but
beware
of
three
and
beyond
this
actually
doesnt
suck
the
problem
i
have
with
this
is
that
it
may
be
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
i
could
see
me
not
wanting
much
more
after
a
few
of
these
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
that
lasts
and
straw
yellow
color
aroma
is
stale
popcorn
flavor
is
pale
malt
corn
muddy
water
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
light
salty
and
fizzy
overall
it
is
easy
to
quaff
but
not
too
special
give
me
me
a
312
pabst
old
style
2
55
o
one
of
the
best
macro
brews
on
the
market
another
good
one
by
pabst
there
is
a
reason
this
is
a
classic
ballpark
beer
i
guess
they
recently
implemented
a
krausening
process
the
last
few
years
that
helps
the
flavor
i
cant
speak
for
that
since
i
did
not
try
this
beer
prior
to
that
process
but
others
seem
to
think
it
has
made
a
big
difference
very
enjoyable
beer
on
a
warm
day
if
you
like
adjunct
american
lagers
not
my
style
but
they
serve
their
purpose
dont
waste
your
time
with
bud
miller
or
coors
go
with
this
bad
boy
very
drinkable
and
its
my
favorite
tastes
great
and
theres
a
lot
of
history
behind
this
beer
i
am
definately
bias
when
it
comes
to
where
the
beer
is
made
because
all
the
best
beer
is
made
in
wisconsin
think
local
drink
local
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
12
oz
cans
for
3
59
the
first
drink
i
knew
this
was
something
different
i
am
a
budweiser
drinker
and
this
instantly
reminded
me
of
bud
it
has
great
mouthfeel
and
no
nasty
aftertaste
like
the
old
cheap
beer
did
the
cost
has
increased
18
pack
was
7
99
in
08
and
now
its
10
but
still
a
good
price
for
a
good
beer
drinkability
instead
of
being
cursed
by
a
goat
i
think
the
cubs
are
cursed
by
old
style
i
am
pretty
disappointed
it
does
the
job
but
it
lacks
a
lot
of
the
bite
and
flavor
i
associate
with
classic
beers
like
this
overall
about
what
i
was
expecting
for
the
1
70
i
got
for
this
and
its
fairly
nonoffensive
for
this
style
of
beer
theres
a
lot
of
malty
sweetness
on
this
one
and
even
though
it
reminds
me
of
harar
from
ethiopia
i
still
feel
like
its
a
bit
too
much
when
it
comes
down
to
it
but
its
a
just
barely
kinda
thing
but
still
its
smooth
overall
very
little
grain
tones
hit
you
and
when
they
do
its
much
later
on
for
an
adjunct
this
isnt
all
that
bad
really
i
mean
i
doubt
im
going
to
run
out
and
make
it
my
standard
but
for
the
experience
and
price
its
not
too
shabby
hey
its
not
remarkable
but
its
easy
drinking
and
good
enough
better
than
bmc
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
aal
a
lot
more
flavor
than
bmc
and
a
nice
cheap
option
thought
i
would
give
this
a
try
bscause
i
like
pbr
big
mistake
this
stuff
is
undrinkable
i
couldnt
even
make
one
bottle
those
saying
this
beer
has
no
off
flavors
i
am
not
sure
what
they
didnt
taste
bc
this
beer
tastes
like
stale
moldy
corn
and
urine
it
is
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
o
pabst
makes
some
of
the
most
tolerable
aals
including
old
style
the
grain
taste
is
just
enough
to
make
it
worth
it
when
its
very
cold
not
that
bad
this
is
the
cubs
beer
so
as
a
reds
fan
its
everything
i
despise
that
being
said
if
youre
looking
for
an
adjunct
lager
to
drink
its
not
bad
appearance
is
typical
aal
light
golden
little
head
retention
and
little
lacing
smell
is
all
rice
and
other
adjunct
grains
taste
is
pretty
smooth
light
and
all
adjuncts
nothing
terrific
here
as
far
as
cheap
shitty
beers
go
but
better
than
coors
or
miller
one
of
the
better
macros
out
there
a
very
good
summer
beer
i
would
imagine
most
persons
who
are
consulting
beeradvocate
might
choose
to
go
with
a
more
expensive
or
refined
beer
but
for
an
american
style
lager
its
pretty
good
taste
is
creamy
and
sweetly
malty
with
a
definite
lack
of
hops
presence
really
a
typical
adjunct
though
with
much
more
flavor
and
character
than
its
big
brother
pbr
or
the
bigger
boys
a
step
above
the
aforementioned
but
not
outstanding
what
can
i
say
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
budweiser
coors
and
all
the
other
frat
beers
definitely
my
session
beer
of
choice
i
love
the
richness
the
krausening
process
adds
to
this
light
flavorful
beer
hardley
bitter
and
far
from
malty
kinda
like
chicken
soup
when
your
sick
o
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
as
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
worth
a
try
o
overall
this
one
has
little
taste
and
smell
probably
meant
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
to
much
very
thin
watery
and
has
no
taste
water
beer
very
basic
and
easy
drinking
notes
this
is
not
light
your
socks
on
fire
beer
but
it
is
an
immensely
drinkable
american
adjunct
lager
that
has
no
off
taste
or
impurities
it
is
sooo
easy
to
drink
if
you
are
in
a
mood
where
you
dont
need
to
be
challenged
or
surprised
this
beer
drop
kicks
bud
miller
coors
and
is
a
cheap
quaffable
lager
that
anyone
could
drink
it
is
a
step
better
than
pbr
and
two
steps
ahead
of
schlitz
it
is
too
bad
that
it
is
not
distributed
in
the
northeast
as
i
would
keep
a
case
of
it
on
hand
at
all
times
o
if
reviewing
this
against
similar
beers
from
the
macros
it
is
good
in
the
grand
spectrum
of
beer
this
would
be
on
the
lowlow
end
that
being
said
it
is
consistent
and
traditional
beer
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
and
corn
taste
is
rather
mild
some
grains
and
malts
are
present
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
wish
we
could
get
bottles
in
ohio
but
next
trip
chicago
i
am
stocking
up
12
oz
bottle
straight
out
of
the
bottle
handed
to
me
by
a
friend
at
the
continental
at
about
430
in
the
morning
dont
pour
this
in
a
glass
its
a
waste
of
water
to
wash
the
glass
after
this
beer
doesnt
deserve
it
tons
of
corn
flavor
some
hop
flavor
better
than
budweiser
and
miller
and
coors
the
worst
of
tasting
of
all
beers
went
down
pretty
easy
anyway
and
quenched
my
thirst
ok
but
not
a
must
have
it
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
you
could
easily
drink
these
all
day
long
this
beer
is
anything
but
intricate
aromatic
and
complex
friends
this
is
simply
beer
it
pours
from
a
cheap
20
oz
can
into
my
beer
mug
it
is
highly
carbonated
and
therefore
boasts
an
enormous
head
if
you
want
it
to
but
this
head
fades
within
a
minute
or
so
leaves
almost
no
lacing
at
all
since
there
isnt
much
in
this
beer
it
barely
embodies
the
yellow
hue
of
a
light
lager
and
is
crystal
clear
it
smells
faintly
and
by
faintly
i
mean
im
so
used
to
smelling
beers
that
actually
have
an
aroma
that
i
cant
be
sure
my
brain
didnt
just
fabricate
the
faint
malt
aroma
all
on
its
own
of
malt
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
and
grainsweet
taste
is
clean
and
dry
with
a
nonoffensive
aftertaste
there
is
a
head
to
this
beer
that
is
somewhat
sticky
far
from
awful
but
not
awfly
good
a
chicago
cub
favorite
i
have
this
everytime
i
visit
chicago
especially
at
a
cubbie
game
this
brew
pours
a
large
head
of
mostly
diminishing
white
mediumly
sized
bubbles
and
a
carbonated
transparent
yellow
rice
beer
colored
body
it
had
a
very
very
mild
malt
aroma
and
a
smooth
almost
unnoticable
malty
and
hop
flavor
with
no
bite
medium
bodied
and
good
carbonation
d
too
metallic
on
the
nose
and
really
really
sweet
but
the
flavor
isnt
as
offensive
as
it
could
have
been
score
one
in
the
moral
victory
column
if
i
hear
one
more
commercial
about
how
kraeusening
makes
things
better
im
gonna
freak
out
deep
breath
this
bit
pours
a
clear
jaundice
topped
by
a
quicklydying
halffinger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
flowers
grass
fake
coriander
and
what
may
or
may
not
be
wheat
i
honestly
cant
tell
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mild
wheat
and
hops
lemon
zest
and
a
lot
of
rather
hard
water
the
body
is
very
light
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
fizzy
weakling
of
a
beer
but
very
easy
to
down
quickly
if
one
so
desires
beer
is
dated
nov
10
pulled
from
the
back
of
the
fridge
at
the
gas
station
pours
out
a
crystalclear
golden
macro
lager
yellow
you
know
the
classic
piss
beer
color
actually
has
some
head
retention
on
the
top
very
effervescent
with
lots
of
active
carbonation
smells
clean
with
some
herbal
hop
notes
in
the
background
with
some
sweet
adjuncts
thrown
in
there
smell
is
so
clean
it
reminds
me
of
fabric
softener
and
i
swear
i
am
get
a
floral
whiffs
that
smell
has
to
be
coming
from
somewhere
else
anyway
smells
interesting
for
such
a
beer
taste
is
somewhat
clear
and
crisp
too
and
dry
picking
up
an
unpleasant
corn
syrupyness
in
there
but
that
is
no
surprise
this
is
the
first
beer
i
ever
tasted
my
dad
would
very
occasionally
drink
one
of
these
if
he
ever
drank
beer
and
i
just
remember
how
awful
beer
tasted
and
it
kinda
still
does
all
do
respect
this
one
is
better
smelling
believe
it
or
not
than
tasting
and
it
is
smooth
and
not
as
carbonated
as
it
appears
which
begs
the
next
question
i
was
tasting
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
before
the
kreusening
and
i
honestly
cannot
taste
much
difference
i
always
have
wondered
why
in
the
world
would
anyone
kreusen
an
adjunct
lager
why
polish
a
turd
clean
and
crisp
finishing
smooth
with
just
a
little
bite
aromas
of
roasted
corn
this
is
a
beer
that
would
make
me
feel
snobbish
for
putting
it
in
a
glass
but
if
you
do
the
color
is
a
nice
bright
light
golden
amber
perfect
for
pounding
down
hot
wings
pizza
a
hot
dog
or
a
burger
theres
a
reason
they
sell
this
at
chicago
cubs
games
great
in
the
summer
but
i
wouldnt
imagine
craving
one
in
december
tasty
and
clean
for
a
retro
lager
great
for
when
you
are
not
looking
for
something
exotic
or
extreme
and
just
want
a
plain
beer
a
perfect
beer
for
that
greasy
slice
of
pepperoni
pizza
or
that
ballpark
dog
slathered
with
chili
md
there
is
some
body
here
but
the
carbonation
is
nasty
too
big
of
bubbles
or
something
the
beer
kind
of
makes
you
feel
full
like
your
stomach
is
going
to
explode
d
the
only
excuse
to
ever
consume
old
style
is
when
you
must
with
no
exceptions
have
a
beer
at
a
chicago
cubs
game
sure
but
is
available
but
who
would
chose
that
drinkability
its
a
nice
beer
to
drink
at
the
ballpark
with
hotdogs
on
the
other
hand
for
the
craft
beer
drinker
chances
are
if
you
are
the
type
who
has
no
problem
purchasing
one
30
bottle
of
beer
that
came
from
an
obscure
craft
brewer
or
belgium
old
style
is
not
likely
a
regular
part
of
your
stock
though
the
30
belgian
and
old
style
are
both
beer
its
clearly
not
apples
to
apples
in
terms
of
ingredients
brewing
process
or
taste
its
not
even
worth
comparing
the
two
deasy
drinkin
adjunct
nothing
special
besides
the
50th
anniversary
of
oktoberfest
in
la
crosse
can
for
cheap
beer
isnt
the
can
novelty
half
the
battle
anyways
drinkability
i
was
impressed
with
this
effort
from
pabst
it
has
a
nice
flavor
nothing
offensive
but
the
feel

mbetter
than

overall
i
drank
this
at
the
blackhawks
stanley
cup
rally
in
chicago
made
me
feel
at
home
a
very
solid
beer
and
easy
to
get
in
the
area
ditch
bmc
and
try
this
d
definitely
a
beer
that
goes
down
easily
its
a
good
sports
in
the
sun
beer
but
not
one
id
seek
out
outside
of
the
friendly
confines
this
beer
was
different
that
much
is
certain
it
had
a
much
i
guess
stronger
is
the
word
i
want
stronger
taste
than
what
you
usually
find
in
an
american
adjunct
lager
it
has
a
bold
taste
that
is
very
drinkable
a
moderate
amount
of
active
carbonation
which
gives
it
a
slight
crispness
when
you
drink
it
it
has
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
much
like
a
traditional
german
lager
would
a
good
beer
for
the
money
and
a
very
nice
american
adjunct
lager
if
you
are
expecting
a
watered
down
taste
like
with
most
a
a
l
s
then
you
are
in
for
a
pleasant
surprise
merely
average
for
the
style
but
its
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
any
of
the
big
3
beer
has
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
and
high
carbonation
the
aroma
seems
to
be
slightly
grainy
it
has
a
light
refreshing
taste
and
was
surprisingly
smooth
i
consider
this
beer
drinkable
especially
at
group
outings
that
calls
for
mass
quantities
of
ice
cold
beer
i
would
select
this
beer
hands
down
over
a
light
beer
taste
is
quite
acceptable
and
it
was
cheap
so
i
cant
argue
with
that
notes
good
for
a
adjunctlight
lager
decent
amount
of
hops
for
the
style
not
a
great
beer
but
good
amount
of
hops
for
the
style
a
clear
pale

with
a
two

fizzy

high

aroma
is
slightly

with
some
corn
notes
hops
barely
detectable
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
for
the

much
like
miller
corn
and
faint
hops
light
body
with
a
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
nothing
offensive
and
a
pretty
smooth
drinker
sessionable
with
a
short
corn
lager
finish
drinkable
and
not
too
bad
d
for
the
style
its
really
not
that
bad
i
could
see
pounding
theses
on
a
hot
day
during
the
summer
pours
a
fair
amount
of
foam
that
quickly
fades
away
some
grain
and
miscellaneous
smells
on
the
nose
nothing
much
taste
is
even
more
lacking
compared
to
other
cheap
beers
of
this
style
old
style
does
have
some
distinctive
qualities
to
it
but
not
in
a
good
way
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
exactly
what
it
is
back
in
college
i
drank
my
fair
share
of
cheap
american
macro
beers
and
many
were
much
more
drinkable
than
this
i
would
pick
just
about
anything
over
this
d
these
beers
were
made
to
be
drank
is
mass
consumption
i
am
a
cubs
fan
so
i
may
be
a
little
biased
but
does
it
get
any
better
than
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
ballpark
or
mowing
the
yard
its
cheap
it
tastes
pretty
good
especially
icecold
it
has
great
carbonation
and
you
can
drink
it
all
day
long
for
what
it
is
i
dont
think
it
can
be
beat
in
its
market
the
bottom
line
is
thisits
a
typical
big
corporate
beer
brewed
by
the
last
of
the
american
owned
big
brewers
in
the
u
s
nice
2009
commemorative
cubs
bottle
though
it
began
with
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
but
quickly
fell
to
mere
wisps
color
was
a
sunshine
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
somewhat
sweetish
with
the
standard
cereal
quality
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
and
mildly
sweet
finish
was
moderately
sweet
but
tasty
i
like
this
for
its
nostalgic
quality
i
would
routinely
drink
it
at
union
station
in
chi
when
passing
through
and
on
a
couple
of
trips
made
a
case
a
carryon
prior
to
911
yeah
its
stones
fizzy
yellow
beer
but
of
some
of
the
american
adjunct
lagers
that
i
have
drank
in
a
can
this
was
passable
pale
gold
with
a
skimpy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
collar
corn
and
steely
grain
in
the
nose
and
not
much
else
tastes
of
grits
and
faint
grain
with
just
the
slightest
touch
of
hop
extract
to
balance
flavors
light
and
effervescent
finishes
clean
a
decent
cheap
beer
that
reminds
me
of
pbr
conclusion
better
than
bmc
for
sure
but
nothing
special
going
on
here
toward
the
upper
middle
of
the
adjunct
lager
pack
not
something
i
would
seek
out
unless
on
a
tight
budget
and
even
then
it
would
be
a
strech
this
beer
is
my
beer
of
choice
when
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
money
it
has
a
medium
golden
color
not
to
light
poured
a
1
cm
head
this
beer
is
very
clean
in
the
mouth
with
quite
pronounced
carbonation
this
beer
does
not
sit
in
your
stomach
like
other
beers
can
such
as
budweiser
but
it
has
a
fuller
taste
that
isnt
as
tart
as
other
beers
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
especially
on
a
hot
day
it
is
by
no
means
a
great
beer
but
for
the
price
and
with
the
right
occasion
it
can
be
a
good
beer
taste
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
compared
to
similar
beers
of
this
style
it
is
better
there
is
no
off
taste
to
it
and
the
flavor
is
slightly
grainy
slightly
yeasty
d
great
super
fine
beer
to
have
at
the
ball
game
not
even
trying
to
bash

but
this
had
more

that

smells
barely
of
anything
but
malt
and

are

taste
is
light
and

not
much
in
the
flavor
department
but
it
does
not
offend
in
any

down

of
these
would
not

a

to
say

a
good
lawnmower
beer
i
friend
of
mine
came
home
friday
with
a
case
of
old
style
returnables
the
beer
has
a
very
sharp
distinctive
taste
almost
like
the
taste
from
a
premium
grain
belt
i
was
told
it
was
dirt
cheap
but
i
probably
wouldnt
by
it
myself
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
post
script
my
memories
of
this
beer
will
forever
be
attached
to
the
image
of
my
fiancee
getting
violently
sick
for
an
entire
day
after
a
bottle
of
hennepin
and
about
5
old
styles
i
got
a
sixer
to
compare
it
to
lacrosse
lager
which
is
now
being
microbrewed
in
the
original
old
style
brewery
even
without
a
comparison
i
could
tell
this
was
the
loser
corny
taste
among
other
adjuncts
at
work
although
there
is
wait
a
minute
a
hint
of
hops
and
yeasty
lager
taste
poking
through
at
the
end
so
not
totally
beyond
redemption
but
still
pale
straw
color
fizzy
like
soda
pop
why
bother
ng
crystalclear
yellow
the
white
head
fizzes
quickly
from
its
apex
of
a
inch
soapy
no
lace
sweet
and
malty
adjuncts
too
mild
potency
it
is
not
inviting
but
not
really
offensive
either
the
first
sip
is
somewhat
jarring
and
so
stereotypical
in
taste
beer
sweet
and
malty
its
not
cloying
or
gross
the
graininess
balances
the
taste
nicely
the
hops
are
soft
kisses
peppered
throughout
the
finish
is
dry
slightly
toasty
and
grainy
solid
seems
free
of
chemicals
medium
body
firm
carbonation
this
is
a
very
respectable
pale
lageramerican
lager
id
drink
this
over
bmcs
standard
products
any
day
if
you
factor
in
the
low
price
a
sixpack
of
tall
boy
cans
run
about
4
00
it
is
hard
not
to
imbibe
in
old
style
on
occasion
this
is
just
not
a
good
beer
at
all
it
also
gives
me
the
runs
the
morning
after
i
drink
it
but
it
is
good
for
drinking
games
because
it
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
have
quite
as
strong
of
an
adjunct
taste
as
other
macros
i
read
this
beer
was
only
3
2
abv
and
i
was
wondering
if
that
was
true
because
i
cant
find
anywhere
that
says
how
strong
it
is
i
know
it
tastes
watery
but
3
2
is
ridiculous
this
beer
was
given
to
me
by
my
roommate
who
is
from
chicago
he
tells
me
that
this
is
the
beer
of
wrigley
field
and
thats
why
theres
a
special
place
for
it
in
his
heart
not
being
a
chicagoinian
i
dont
have
that
feeling
and
without
it
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
to
you
its
a
standard
pale
lager
not
much
flavor
besides
the
water
only
real
purpose
is
a
nice
buzz
so
if
thats
whats
youre
after
this
is
for
you

faint

the

are

the

is
not
a
really
good

but
not
awfull
either

it

i
have

beers

this

remains

this
beer
in
my
mind
is
the
epitome
of
what
a
budget
beer
should
be
difficult
to
find
in
the
detroit
area
its
worth
the
4

is
an

regional
brand
that
used
to
be

area
not
sure
if
its
true
to
its
style
anymore
but
its
a
decent
american
lager
that
goes
down
easy
and
quenches
accordingly
otherwise
nothing
special
but
a
nice
change
up
from
the
usual
suspects
if
there
was
a
rating
for
nostalgia
this
gets
a

a

american
lager
but
surprisingly
it
has
some

to
it

just
a

i
am
sure
the
fine
folks
of

still
drink
enough
of
this
to
keep
the
brand
alive

for

is
the
way
to
goh
a
baltimore
classic
amy
kanooski
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
aal
granted
aal
is
far
from
my
go
to
style
near
the
bottom
in
fact
however
measured
against
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
those
keeping
an
open
mind
and
not
having
the
expectations
this
is
something
its
not
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
typical
bad
yet
refreshing
and
drinkable
adjunct
with
a
little
bit
of
a
funny
taste
in
the
nose
nothing
to
see
here
so
i
thought
why
the
hell
not
while
at
the
green
turtle
in
annapolis
ended
up
with
a
glass
of
fizzy
yellow
water
that
mayvor
may
not
have
contained
corn
byproduct
at
some
point
in
time
needless
to
say
this
is
a
boring
bland
beer
that
apparently
has
niche
hipstrt
appeal
go
figure
almost
at
the
us
defined
session
beer
at
4
6
id
take
this
over
the
few
other
aals
that
linger
in
the
stores
around
town
that
include
bmcold
name
of
course
and
non
bmc
actually
fairly
decent
for
what
it
is
theres
a
little
hoppiness
accompanying
the
normal
macro
corn
flavors
but
is
not
cloying
i
cant
drink
much
of
it
before
im
sick
of
it
but
that
goes
for
pretty
much
every
domestic
lager
better
than
most
a
sixer
takes
me
down
memory
lane
every
now
then
feeling
generous
with
the
rating
but
it
deserves
it
i
hate
the
city
of
baltimore
and
their
criminal
football
team
but
oh
boy
what
a
beer
i
love
me
a
cheap
light
novelty
beer
and
i
always
drink
natty
bo
from
16
oz
pounder
cans
ratings
are
earned
through
finesse
rather
than
impress
you
get
what
you
pay
for
for
excellent
sip
to
sip
value
no
bs
here
this
is
a
smooth
beer
that
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
or
after
work
goes
great
with
some
maryland
blue
crab
i
am
arn
ipa
drinker
so
to
me
its
kinda
bland
but
quite
refreshing
when
served
cold
on
a
hot
summers
day
overall
3
54
the
label
says
it
was
made
in
wi
i
think
its
still
pabst
made
though
anyways
this
lager
tastes
paerrrrty
good
its
a
good
pair
for
food
and
a
night
on
the
couch
watching
the
office
love
the
one
eyed
guy
on
the
label
and
i
wish
they
made
it
up
here
nice
stuff
back
to
the
couch
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
a
nascar
race
or
a
tailgate
for
some
reason
i
smell
hot
dog
from
this
beer
best
served
in
an
old
bayrimmed
glass
overall
if
i
want
to
drink
a
beer
where
i
dont
want
to
think
or
be
disappointed
or
horrified
this
is
pretty
much
it
in
a
nutshell
ive
had
a
lot
of
adjunct
lagers
and
pilsners
and
for
its
style
natty
boh
isnt
terrible
theres
no
complexity
but
thats
not
what
pabst
is
aiming
for
good
for
baseball
good
old
boh
so
many
great
memories
were
made
with
this
beer
which
may
be
the
reason
for
my
higher
rating
i
still
say
the
best
way
to
enjoy
natty
boh
is
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
at
an
os
game
on
a
mid
summer
night
although
it
will
cost
you
8
well
worth
it
in
my
opinion
i
only
drink
this
beer
from
a
long
neck
bottle
the
cap
has
puzzle
on
it
there
r
413
different
puzzles
they
r
fun
to
solve
and
we
do
not
let
drink
the
beer
until
u
solve
the
puzzle
i
will
have
a
few
tonight
with
some
maryland
steamed
crabs
oh
what
a
beer
i
like
this
beer
i
like
baltimore
i
like
camden
yards
i
like
to
drink
this
beer
when
in
baltimore
and
maybe
even
at
camden
yards
watching
the
red
sox
whoopin
some
robin
birds
good
beer
great
logo
ice
cold
gimme
gimme
yum
yum
if
not
in
baltimore
and
i
can
find
it
wherever
i
live
i
like
to
drink
em
and
watch
the
wire
and
perhaps
listen
to
j
roddy
walston
the
business
born
raised
and
educated
in
md
this
offering
was
available
everywhere
during
my
salad
years
yeah
its
an
adjunct
but
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
while
eating
crabs
better
when
ice
cold
dont
let
it
warm
it
will
ruin
your
day
sentimentality
aside
a
decent
adjunct
lager
what
else
is
to
be
said
about
good
old
natty
boh
its
a
baltimore
delicacy
hon
well
not
really
since
its
been
bought
out
by
milwaukee
brewing
co
best
served
with
crabs
or
another
natty
boh
considered
a
staple
of
the
city
many
people
take
pride
in
drinking
this
questionable
beverage
most
likely
brewed
with
corn
and
leftover
hops
from
the
miller
light
batches
this
beer
is
downright
bad
however
it
has
the
best
deal
you
can
get
30
packs
for
14
bucks
oh
yeahhhh
poor
scores
across
the
board
except
for
the
overall
category
which
i
gave
a
5
my
reasoning
has
nothing
to
do
with
beer
the
ravens
have
won
every
playoff
game
including
the
super
bowl
in
which
i
drank
natty
boh
therefore
overall
the
beer
is
outstanding
o
not
half
bad
cant
say
that
i
dont
like
it
as
a
maryland
resident
natty
boh
is
a
requirement
watching
sports
and
eating
wings
at
bdubs
certainly
aided
the
drinking
of
this
beer
if
i
were
to
sit
down
and
drink
this
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
certainly
would
not
be
impressed
nevertheless
there
are
beers
for
different
atmospheres
and
this
is
great
for
redskins
wizards
games
better
than
bmc
for
sure
o
theres
nothing
good
about
this
beer
but
i
hate
to
kill
a
beer
so
ill
give
a
nod
to
its
name
which
is
catchy
the
notion
that
this
beer
evokes
maryland
pride
is
scary
this
isnt
the
best
beer
for
most
places
but
at
a
baseball
game
especially
at
camden
yards
this
is
the
beer
to
drink
its
a
perfect
pale
beer
and
very
refreshing
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
and
really
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
afternoon
this
is
what
the
other
yellow
water
beers
should
try
to
be
the
feel
is
okay
its
got
the
crispness
and
is
reasonably
clean
in
its
appropriately
light
body
without
too
much
slickness
threatening
o
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
sessionable
better
than
most
of
the
other
bmc
products
as
it
does
not
taste
of
preservatives
cheersand
peace
to
all
maryland
crabs
redskins
games
and
national
bohemian
great
times
appearance
yeah
it
looks
great
in
the
can
no
way
am
i
pouring
this
into
a
glass
smells
very
clean
a
bit
of
hops
and
carbonic
acid
and
maybe
the
slightest
impression
of
malt
but
it
does
smell
a
tad
sugary
starts
off
wanting
to
have
a
taste
then
there
is
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
in
the
middle
before
the
mostly
clean
stinging
carbonic
finish
doesnt
sound
too
appetizing
but
for
the
category
its
a
winner
overall
better
than
most
in
this
category
got
the
can
from
a
friend
who
is
from
baltimore
i
guess
it
id
there
state
beer
very
drinkable
but
basic
this
is
baltimore
baby
crabs
and
boh
it
doesnt
get
much
better
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
versions
of
the
style
which
is
why
i
gave
it
a
4
in
the
overall
category
even
though
my
ratings
would
suggest
otherwise
its
not
as
good
as
schlitz
gusto
but
to
me
it
is
more
enjoyable
than
most
of
the
others
in
the
category
its
also
cheap
which
is
nice
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
sweet
grain
that
is
it
tastes
of
water
grain
and
maybe
a
little
corn
beer
is
carbonated
correctly
and
is
very
drinkable
for
its
light
body
overall
a
slightly
below
average
beer
but
not
a
bad
adjunct
lager
if
youve
ever
been
to
baltimore
in
the
past
10
years
youve
seen
natty
boh
out
at
the
bars
it
is
a
seventies
style
american
beer
it
is
made
to
be
cheap
people
only
drink
it
in
the
city
because
of
its
price
and
nostalgia
everyones
parents
in
baltimore
ate
steamed
crabs
and
swigged
down
the
old
bay
with
some
natty
boh
and
so
the
tradition
continues
buy
some
natty
boh
its
baltimore
in
a
can
one
of
the
better
shitty
beers
on
par
with
pbr
though
not
much
of
a
surprise
since
theyre
made
by
the
same
brewer
the
beer
is
very
clear
and
has
is
slightly
straw
colored
this
beer
looks
like
water
more
than
any
other
ive
had
the
white
foam
head
settles
down
quickly
aroma
is
standard
for
the
style
sweet
malt
and
rice
and
not
a
hop
to
be
found
big
corn
flavors
abound
when
i
taste
it
light
body
and
not
too
much
carbonation
surprisingly
there
is
little
coating
whats
there
is
sweet
but
not
all
that
sticky
all
in
all
this
is
just
another
adjunct
lager
it
may
have
some
local
pride
the
way
naragansett
does
here
in
new
england
but
outside
of
slumming
it
while
drinking
in
dc
there
isnt
much
reason
to
seek
this
beer
out
people
need
to
like
beers
for
what
they
are
and
not
what
they
want
not
everybody
is
trying
to
be
russian
river
beers
like
this
have
a
place
which
is
why
it
has
a
category
all
the
real
people
i
know
presumably
im
one
dont
drink
4
year
old
ris
every
weekend
they
have
fillers
beers
like
these
give
it
a
rest
with
the
poor
most
of
you
wouldnt
dare
take
a
blind
taste
test
and
if
you
did
im
guessing
most
would
be
magically
surprised
that
some
beers
taste
better
than
their
label
and
some
taste
worse
overall
a
better
than
average
adjunct
lager
but
not
a
lot
to
set
it
apart
from
others
better
and
cheaper
than
bmc
so
that
is
a
definite
plus
this
is
better
than
pbr
and
the
faint
biscuit
notes
make
it
a
bit
more
interesting
than
your
average
macro
and
its
cheap
despite
these
positives
this
is
yet
another
cheap
mass
produced
beer
that
fails
to
excite
me
not
much
going
on
with
the
lager
i
must
admit
is
beats
a
majority
of
your
mainstream
adjunct
lagers
there
may
be
a
lack
of
taste
but
nothing
about
this
beer
is
unpleasant
overall
other
than
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
standard
adjunct
lager
very
drinkable
but
not
very
special
all
that
said
this
is
comically
easy
to
put
down
in
quantity
which
has
its
virtues
i
will
get
this
on
occasion
although
it
is
not
up
there
with
pbr
and
schlitz
which
are
the
outside
beers
of
summer
in
my
book
o
really
not
impressed
by
this
brew
i
thought
pabst
would
try
to
put
out
something
a
notch
above
what
they
usually
do
but
instead
they
put
out
their
own
version
of
coors
light
watery
excessively
carbonated
and
boring
avoid
this
brew
unless
youre
trying
to
get
shtfaced
2
5
mouthfeel
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
very
crisp
pretty
much
the
official
beer
you
should
drink
at
os
games
tastes
better
and
cheaper
than
your
usual
macros
taking
into
account
that
this
is
a
cheap
beer
and
knowing
that
it
should
reviewed
as
such
and
compared
to
other
lower
mass
produced
beer
i
didnt
think
that
this
beer
had
any
great
qualities
for
this
self
proclaimed
category
but
when
in
maryland
you
must
drink
what
the
locals
drink
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
the
greatest
but
good
for
a
good
backyard
party
exactly
how
i
had
it
so
if
you
need
a
cheap
beer
and
your
perhaps
from
outofstate
could
be
a
good
change
up
from
the
usual
overall
its
what
youd
expect
from
a
popular
local
lager
at
a
good
price
it
would
make
a
fair
trip
substitute
for
something
like
budweiser
or
miller
but
over
craft
options
its
not
even
worth
the
couple
of
bucks
one
of
the
lightest
flavored
aa
lagers
i
have
ever
had
and
theres
little
wrong
with
that
if
youre
in
the
right
mode
3
o
this
beer
is
nothing
special
it
is
however
good
for
what
it
is
it
obviously
sets
out
to
be
lighter
and
easy
drinkingwhich
it
most
certainly
is
plus
being
from
bmore
i
cant
hate
on
natty
boh
m
d
an
easy
downermoderate
carbonation
keeps
it
from
stinging
like
a
soda
a
good
simple
outdoor
beer
that
i
was
satisfied
spending
some
time
in
the
sun
with
well
i
had
to
go
all
the
down
to
maryland
just
to
get
my
hands
on
some
natty
boh
though
it
isnt
brewed
in
baltimore
anymore
its
a
smooth
pale
macro
lager
and
its
great
i
recommend
it
over
all
its
got
a
slight
taste
but
thats
the
way
i
like
my
beer
and
it
a
summer
beer
perfect
to
sit
down
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
pound
down
about
8
or
10
or
so
great
beer
indeed
o
if
you
are
from
the
baltimore
area
you
have
probably
swilled
a
natty
boh
this
is
beer
is
a
baltimore
institution
cult
people
actually
tattoo
them
selves
the
the
natty
boh
guy
enjoy
i
think
overall
i
last
had
this
beer
20
years
ago
in
college
can
i
really
didnt
like
it
then
at
all
i
find
it
much
easier
to
drink
today
owned
by
papst
but
much
better
than
a
pbr
enjoyed
a
natty
boh
on
tap
at
dogwatch
tavern
very
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
negligible
head
and
ample
carbonation
very
little
in
the
way
of
aroma
beyond
the
faint
wheat
smell
the
beer
is
a
decent
one
as
far
as
inexpensive
mass
produced
beers
go
the
flavor
is
clean
with
some
wheat
taste
present
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
compared
to
my
normal
favorites
this
is
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
baltimore
area
watching
a
ball
game
76
but
you
know
the
deal
its
a
macro
lager
so
drink
it
straight
from
the
can
as
frosty
cold
as
possible
without
over
analyzing
it
i
love
the
boh
plain
and
simple
natty
boh
please
dont
go
ill
drive
to
and
fro
so
you
can
go
into
my
stomach
below
a
wonderful
beverage
from
americas
past
that
has
surpassed
potential
extinction
and
emerged
unscathed
to
the
bright
side
o
refreshing
yet
gritty
its
baltimore
in
a
can
nuff
said
out
of
a
can
this
retro
sixpack
cost
me
only
3
50
this
beer
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
the
retention
of
the
head
was
not
bad
and
it
left
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
pilsner
malt
corn
and
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
the
flavors
were
very
similar
but
very
drinkable
for
a
macrobeer
i
tasted
mostly
pale
malt
and
corn
with
a
bit
of
lingering
sugar
that
helped
to
fill
it
out
the
body
was
medium
the
carbonation
appropriate
and
the
mouthfeel
good
simple
but
solid
upon
reflection
i
concluded
that
this
bargain
beer
had
some
real
substance
and
better
than
almost
all
of
its
competition
in
my
opinion
o
baltimore
legend
dont
get
me
wrong
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
was
only
a
step
above
on
a
budweiser
a
classic
a
necessity
for
anyone
visiting
downtown
baltimore
for
the
first
time
cannot
beat
natty
boh
when
you
are
looking
for
a
satisfying
cheap
beer
in
maryland
while
it
will
not
please
those
who
strictly
drink
craft
beers
i
will
take
a
natty
boh
over
any
other
similar
macrolager
any
day
of
the
week
o
for
what
it
is
natty
boh
is
one
of
my
favorite
cheap
adjuncts
its
refreshing
and
doesnt
have
any
off
flavors
to
it
as
long
as
you
keep
the
style
in
mind
natty
boh
is
definitely
worth
your
time
too
bad
i
cant
get
it
in
va
though
md
is
a
short
drive
but
natty
boh
will
be
my
goto
when
i
want
a
lawnmower
beer
every
big
city
has
one
their
own
cheap
plentiful
shamelessly
promoted
cheap
beer
baltimore
has
natty
boh
as
cheap
beers
go
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
a
nice
crispness
to
the
beer
and
some
actual
hops
detected
while
you
drink
it
you
can
pick
up
24
of
these
bad
boys
for
1213
while
it
isnt
special
by
any
means
it
isnt
meant
to
be
its
a
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
night
or
to
take
advantage
of
the
1
special
at
the
bar
and
its
delicious
and
refreshing
no
frills
but
above
average
for
its
style
the
cpj
enjoy
o
for
the
style
really
not
bad
at
all
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
a
good
substitute
for
the
watery
light
lagers
out
there
o
easily
one
of
the
better
adjuncts
on
the
shelf
and
the
memories
i
have
associated
with
this
beer
are
unquantifiable
ill
always
pick
up
a
case
or
two
when
im
visiting
home
d
not
a
very
good
beer
if
youre
in
baltimore
you
might
be
obligated
to
have
one
outside
of
that
its
not
much
better
than
your
standard
lager
past
the
looks
and
mouthfeel
drinkability
its
a
hometown
favorite
cheap
drinkable
and
not
that
discernable
from
other
more
pricey
beers
of
the
same
adjunct
style
i
love
natty
boh
i
drank
a
ton
of
this
during
my
7
years
living
in
baltimore
my
local
corner
bar
had
it
on
tap
for
1
a
pintalways
ice
cold
with
a
plate
of
steamed
shrimp
or
a
crab
pick
goes
well
its
a
simple
adjunct
lagercrisp
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
drinks
easy
oh
did
i
mention
its
cheap
whenever
im
back
in
town
i
always
stop
for
a
case
or
two
to
bring
home
in
all
honesty
its
no
better
or
worse
than
the
higher
priced
adjuncts
like
coors
or
bud
only
cheap
beers
i
prefer
would
be
miller
high
life
or
yuengling
lager
o
overall
this
beer
was
average
at
best
with
nothing
that
makes
it
better
than
most
adjuncts
in
my
opinion
it
was
a
good
and
well
made
for
what
it
was
suppose
to
be
the
lower
abv
makes
it
easy
to
have
many
pints
of
this
if
this
were
around
where
i
lived
i
would
have
this
after
mowing
the
lawn
in
the
hot
sun
easy
for
the
price
of
a
six
pack
of
bottles

you
can
make

im
from

we
are
apparently
the
only
people
that
love
this
as
much
we
put
this
stuff
down
like
theres
no
tomorrow
by
far
my
favorite
crap

a
step
up
from
your
traditional
light
beers
for
similar

except
boh
is
not
a
light

goes
great
with

very
easy

good

well
many
times
d
on

what
more

i
need
oh
yeah
happy
hour
pricing
a
nice
way
to
end
the
belgian
beer

taste
a
light
in
flavor
cant
wait
to
try
natty
boh
on
tap
this
year
d
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
crab
feasts
or
long
days
at

a
bigger
beer
basically
any

may
do
you
in
review

this
natty
boh
beer
is
special
to
me
as
i
usually
have
it
before
the
orioles
baseball
game
where
they
sell
tall
cans
cheap
2
to
3
good
times
national
bohemian
has
a
thick
white
head
and
a
very
clear
golden
appearance
carbonation
is
high
aroma
is
faint
but
what
one
would
expect
from
an
americanstyle
adjunct
lager
that
beer
smell
taste
is
delightful
with
a
nice
hop
balance
hop
character
is
a
bit
more
pronounced
than
others
in
this
style
category
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
natty
boh
finishes
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
usually
reserve
it
for
prebaseball
tailgating
in
baltimore
nattyboh
baby
d
id
love
to
give
this
a
worse
review
but
it
is
up
to
adjunct
lager
standards
and
it
has
a
lot
of
eastern
md
nostalgia
its
my
beer
of
choice
when
playing
beer
pong
and
such
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
to
sip
on
or
pair
with
a
meal
beer
is
thin
and
grainy
almost
no
sweetness
the
finish
is
boring
as
well
its
a
grainy
watery
beer
with
almost
no
flavor
i
was
expecting
too
much
from
pabst
in
this
case
pale
light
golden
in
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
of
very
slight
grain
a
bit
metallic
a
tad
of
lager
and
some
hop
bitterness
it
is
very
finely
carbonated
giving
a
tickle
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
light
without
being
watery
the
taste
has
the
same
notes
as
the
aroma
grain
slight
applemetal
tartness
bit
of
lager
and
very
slight
hop
bitterness
but
i
would
say
that
the
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
this
is
good
solid
cheap
beer
is
it
the
best
cheap
beer
not
at
all
there
are
some
with
better
aroma
and
flavor
but
there
are
also
many
that
are
worse
in
addition
i
did
really
like
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
at
least
for
a
cheap
american
adjunct
lager
drinkability
i
rated
the
drinkability
unusually
high
due
to
the
nostalgia
that
natty
boh
brings
this
is
by
no
means
a
craft
beer
but
still
enjoyable
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
when
watching
the
game
if
nothing
else
its
a
good
alternative
to
a
bmc
when
available
im
not
sure
about
anywhere
else
that
you
can
get
it
but
if
you
have
a
couple
bucks
you
can
get
a
decent
amount
of
this
stuff
in
baltimore
like
a
sixer
for
3
you
have
no
excuse
to
not
at
least
try
it
here
d
i
was
drinking
this
since
i
was
with
a
group
and
it
was
offered
but
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
this
personally
it
is
bland
and
there
are
too
many
canned
options
with
way
more
flavor
out
there
rjt
overall
this
is
my
favorite
macro
lager
probably
cuz
i
grew
up
in
baltimore
and
still
live
there
so
its
iconic
of
home
i
prefer
almost
any
craft
offering
over
this
but
as
far
as
macros
go
this
is
my
go
to
beer
ill
be
honest
granting
you
the
reader
full
disclosure
i
wasnt
going
to
do
an
astmd
review
of
this
beer
however
i
changed
my
mind
because
i
didnt
want
to
appear
to
be
too
biased
do
you
want
me
to
be
honest
though
i
am
biased
with
this
beer
i
loose
my
objectivity
and
i
think
back
to
experiences
around
fells
point
and
the
west
side
of
baltimore
this
brew
has
history
on
its
side
and
regardless
of
where
you
stand
im
in
mr
bos
corner
not
a
good
beer
but
not
a
bad
cheap
beer
the
cheap
beer
costbenefit
analysis
works
out
comparatively
well
unless
you
live
close
to
the
college
park
shoppers
food
warehouse
where
12packs
of
schlitz
are
by
some
act
of
god
less
than
five
dollars
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
really
have
to
score
nattyboh
on
a
scale
of
smell
taste
drinkability
and
nostalgia
its
a
part
of
our
history
and
when
given
the
choice
between
this
and
miller
lite
ill
spend
the
evening
with
mr
boh
anytime
wink
wink
natty
boh
is
drinkable
for
what
it
is
it
doesnt
become
atrocious
when
it
warms
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
that
awful
metallic
macro
taste
even
when
drinking
from
the
can
and
its
cheap
as
hell
not
worth
searching
out
but
if
youre
visiting
maryland
you
ought
to
try
it
at
least
once
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
rather
bland
some
sweetness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
fairly
good
overall
not
much
going
for
this
beer
other
than
the
cheap

i
was
not
impressed
with
this
at
all
it
took
quite
a
while
just
to
guzzle
down
the
first
bottle
then
again
im
not
a

this
lightly
golden
lager
had
a
clean
smell
a
bit
of
grainygrassiness

otherwise
unremarkable

was
lightly

generic

d
not
the
worst
choice
for
a
frat
party
but
far
from
the
best
the
mouthfeel
is
not
great
as
well
almost
no
carbonation
with
no
head
the
only
thing
is
that
you
can
drink
this
all
day
although
you
mouth
wont
taste
very
good
the
next
morning
i
will
stick
to
drinking
it
for
old
times
once
a
year
not
the
best
brew
out
there
but
nothing
to
really
complain
about
would
make
a
great
dinner
beer
natty
boh
is
a
given
with
a
table
full
of
hot
steamed
crabs
d
nothing
offensive
about
it
at
all
although
the
flavor
is
somewhat
weak
and
watery
the
taste
is
actually
well
above
average
but
its
just
a
little
too
muted
still
better
and
more
drinkable
than
most
comparable
bargainbasement
macros
throwback
beer
for
what
natty
boh
intends
to
be
you
cant
beat
it
the
price
is
great
about
9
for
a
case
of
cans
and
the
taste
is
not
at
all
foul
although
i
do
prefer
and
recommend
the
slighlty
more
expensive
bottles
the
cans
fit
the
bill
just
fine
bottoms
up
this
was
the
last
of
a
six
pack
and
i
thought
that
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
get
a
review
on
file
it
poured
with
a
fingers
worth
of
bone
white
head
with
lousy
retention
it
was
disappearing
as
quickly
as
i
could
pour
the
color
was
a
crystal
clear
palestraw
yellow
the
nose
was
on
the
sweet
side
very
lagerlike
but
with
an
underlying
sugary
smell
at
the
same
time
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
and
there
was
a
faint
sweetness
on
the
tongue
but
that
was
about
it
the
finish
was
unobtrusive
at
best
this
is
truly
a
lawnmower
beer
it
would
be
nice
and
refreshing
cold
out
of
the
cooler
on
a
hot
day
but
beyond
that
it
was
pretty
nondescript
so
this
crappy
beer
lets
not
kid
ourselves
sort
of
reminds
me
a
bit
of
strohs
but
with
a
somewhat
cleaner
flavor
profile
of
course
its
a
terrible
beer
but
in
the
world
of
lousy
macros
i
have
to
say
ive
had
much
worse
pretty
much
everything
made
by
bmc
this
beer
would
make
good
snail
bait
or
for
that
matter
probably
wouldnt
be
bad
in
beer
chile
or
beer
bread
this
is
a
lousy
beer
but
in
all
fairness
is
not
nearly
as
lousy
as
i
was
expecting
in
a
blind
taste
test
im
not
sure
but
i
wouldnt
rate
it
higher
then
yuengling
lager
i
know
thats
not
saying
a
whole
lot
but
this
truly
isnt
nearly
as
wretched
a
beer
as
i
was
expecting
though
the
longer
it
sits
in
the
glass
the
more
tiringboring
it
is
to
drink
ho
hum
ive
had
worse
d
for
the
style
its
an
average
beer
not
great
but
not
bad
this
could
be
a
session
beer
on
a
summer
day
while
bbqing
this
was
probably
one
of
the
most
disappointing
beers
i
have
ever
drank
trying
to
be
unbiased
but
the
most
noticeable
taste
was
the
aluminum
in
the
can
smell
was
sort
of
funky
has
an
ok
middle
taste
but
an
aftertaste
which
is
slightly
light
less
enjouable
follows
felt
a
bit
watery
ok
for
one
drink
or
2
but
not
one
id
go
out
out
of
my
way
to
get
or
drink
first
choice
of
beer
to
drink
with
maryland
blue
crabs
its
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
pretty
good
give
it
a
try
overall
a
fantastic
macro
lager
too
bad
i
cant
get
it
here
in
mi
now
this
isnt
to
say
those
of
you
that
enjoy
the
hearty
beer
and
like
to
sip
and
enjoy
a
beer
versus
a
few
or
more
in
a
sitting
should
switch
brands
or
anything
natty
boh
doesnt
try
too
hard
to
impress
it
just
does
for
those
of
you
that
drink
a
lot
of
macrobeers
like
coors
and
budweiser
deff
gives
this
one
a
shot
i
think
you
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
overall
this
is
a
classic
collegeesque
beer
dont
expect
much
more
out
of
it
the
mouth
is
blessed
with
crackling
carbonation
that
adds
to
the
enjoyment
of
this
simple
beer
you
could
do
much
worse
than
this
old
time
favorite
very
easy
to
pair
with
crabs
and
oysters
i
grew
up
in
maryland
so
i
know
this
beer
well
despite
the
fact
that
i
moved
out
of
the
state
before
i
really
had
a
chance
to
give
it
a
shot
i
had
my
friend
pick
up
a
twelve
pack
on
his
recent
visit
natty
boh
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
short
lived
head
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
grainy
not
too
much
else
taste
is
a
sweet
grainy
malt
flavor
no
hops
really
to
speak
of
fuller
body
and
more
flavor
than
i
would
expect
from
a
4
2
macro
lager
this
one
is
definitely
a
good
party
beer
when
youre
on
a
very
low
budget
and
i
would
drink
it
every
now
and
then
if
it
was
around
my
area
next
time
im
eating
crabs
in
maryland
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
to
help
them
go
down
now
stand
back
a
minute
pardner
why
such
high
marks
on
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
well
its
the
funnest
water
i
ever
swallowed
with
a
slight
buzz
to
boot
at
the
end
of
a
long
night
of
british
and
belgian
ale
drinking
i
thought
i
was
down
for
the
count
but
i
was
still
thirsty
and
not
ready
for
my
prebedtime
glass
of
water
mr
boh
to
the
rescue
it
was
nothing
short
of
miraculous
i
got
a
whole
can
of
it
down
quenched
my
thirst
for
one
more
beer
and
didnt
add
to
the
risk
factor
of
my
heavy
evening
score
cheers
as
a
side
note
after
the
old
national
brewery
closed
a
small
corner
of
it
eventually
went
on
to
house
brimstone
brewing
operated
by
marc
tewey
reminds
me
of
my
first
homebrewed
pilsner
i
didnt
drink
much
of
that
either
this
beer
is
a
bit
muddy
but
intriguing
nevertheless
a
dirty
bruised
apple
and
peach
yeasty
confectionate
sugar
sweetness
eminates
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
has
a
typical
lager
look
with
good
head
formation
and
retention
body
actually
stood
up
a
bit
better
than
expected
an
extra
cornsugar
sweetness
persists
and
leaves
the
body
a
bit
heavier
problematic
is
a
heavy
presence
of
buttererd
popcorn
celery
and
cooked
vegetable
flavors
that
was
difficult
to
look
past
as
you
could
imagine
the
finish
had
a
thick
lingering
and
left
the
mouth
very
slick
and
oily
figured
i
should
review
this
since
its
logo
is
my
avatar
so
here
is
my
500th
review
rather
pale
golden
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
very
low
aromanothing
there
really
its
not
bad
or
anything
just
isnt
there
mild
malt
flavor
with
a
trace
of
bitterness
somewhat
sweet
in
the
finish
average
body
for
the
usual
macros
out
there
fairly
average
overall
i
love
a
good
macro
but
think
i
would
pass
on
this
one
from
what
people
tell
me
this
and
national
premium
were
quite
the
beers
in
their
day
d
lets
just
say
this
if
this
was
available
in
my
area
and
i
was
in
high
school
again
this
would
be
my
beer
of
choice
id
much
rather
be
drinking
this
as
apposed
to
mickeys
or
beast
in
fact
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
now
on
occasion
not
bad
i
have
to
agree
with
palffyfan
from
boston
tiz
a
malty
beverage
and
thats
what
i
notice
more
than
anything
not
a
bad
thing
however
as
its
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
smooth
plus
i
get
sick
of
hearing
about
hops
theyre
decent
but
what
the
hell
thats
not
what
beer
is
all
about
malt
is
another
aspect
and
nat
boh
seems
to
deliver
in
that
category
nice
switch
from
the
hop
craze
and
i
really
dont
mind
this
classic
brew
at
all
again
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
decent
flavor
light
on
the
palette
or
tongue
if
you
will
and
pretty
coollooking
oldfashioned
design
i
do
think
thats
the
pringles
dude
he
must
be
moonlighting
i
recommend
this
and
at
11
79
for
24
of
these
how
could
you
beat
it
although
ive
yet
to
try
em
with
crabs
as
everyone
recommends
its
pretty
damn
good
just
drinkin
by
its
lonesome
whilst
sittin
here
on
the
pc
give
em
a
try
especially
if
you
like
a
more
malty
brew
with
less
of
a
hop
character
you
wont
be
disappointed
and
your
wallet
wont
hurt
either
bottoms
up
my
friends
i
know
there
is
a
strong
regional
following
for
this
beer
but
without
the
ballgame
association
this
stuff
is
pretty
bland
approaching
flavorless
has
the
same
fizzy
slightly
sour
thinness
that
one
finds
in
light
beers
not
much
malt
no
hops
that
i
could
find
about
the
only
thing
i
can
say
about
the
beer
is
that
it
lacks
the
flavor
to
offend
drinkability
beers
maltiness
would
wear
on
me
not
much
of
a
character
to
this
beer
so
i
would
avoid
this
in
the
future
a
real
thirstquencer
that
i
always
keep
in
stock
sometimes
its
hard
to
find
bottles
though
because
popularity
among
the
masses
has
skyrocketed
around
here
this
review
is
dedicated
to
the
people
of
maryland
who
according
to
legend
live
off
of
this
shit
and
to
our
regional
hero
national
treasure
and
friend

uhm
thanks
guys
i
really
appreciate
the
opportunity
the

c50668
pours
a
fizzy
white
three
finger
head
over
a
crystal
clear
light
straw
colored
liquid
the
head
started
out
like
a
soda
but
its
turned
sticky
and
has
left
decent
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
smells
very
mild
mostly
i
get
a
dark
noble
hop
something
like
spalt
hops
there
is
a
nondescript
sweet
way
beneath
and
thats
about
it
for
the
aromas
tastes
are
out
of
balance
the
primary
flavor
is
a
dark
edgy
hop
greasy
and
dirty
perhaps
tettnanger
hops
the
hop
character
is
bolstered
by
an
acrid
from
carbonation
sweet
is
much
too
far
below
to
contribute
helpfully
light
body
and
heavily
carbonated
i
would
describe
this
as
the
ipa
of
american
macro
lagers
tough
to
put
down
watered
down
piss
color
with
a
rocky
white
head
metallic
corn
aroma
corn
taste
watery
glad
this
was
freezing
cold
not
exactly
what
id
call
a
goo
dbeer
had
it
for
the
first
time
just
last
night
and
i
think
it
is
quite
safe
to
say
that
it
will
be
the
last
time
i
ever
have
it
again
d
ah
boh
goes
does
easily
one
of
my
favorite
cheap
beers
nothing
washes
down
a
bushel
of
crabs
like
boh
i
heard
someone
talking
about
natty
bo
and
i
wasnt
sure
what
it
was
until
my
roommate
brought
some
of
this
stuff
back
from
annapolis
apparently
its
a
big
maryland
beer
the
can
is
awesome
from
the
land
of
pleasant
living
with
a
oneeyed
face
that
resembles
the
pringles
guy
served
chilled
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
pours
a
very
light
gold
with
few
streams
of
carbonation
and
a
2
finger
white
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
smells
very
clean
with
grains
a
touch
of
fruits
hops
floral
and
a
hint
of
metal
taste
delivers
about
the
same
with
a
mediumlight
tingly
body
overall
way
better
than
other
macro
beers
and
just
as
drinkable
if
not
more
so
for
the
same
price
this
is
your
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
whilst
tailgating
andor
eating
bushels
of
crabs
ive
seen
a
lot
of
negative
reviews
however
most
appear
to
come
from
the
rancid
can
version
and
not
from
the
fine
fresh
bottled
versions
around
for
the
price
34
a
sixer
retail
and
as
low
as
1
25
at
some
local
bars
you
cant
really
beat
it
this
is
my
go
to
brew
when
stuck
somewhere
with
nothing
but
macros
or
questionable
taps
which
happen
to
be
too
many
of
the
bars
in
the
area
ill
try
to
throw
this
one
in
with
the
next
few
bifs
to
get
some
nonregional
love

is
coming

mystique
natty
boh
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
by
the
pool
with
good
friends
and
a
couple
dozen
steamed
crabs
its
light
flavor
doesnt
interfere
with
the
taste
of
the
foods
and
its
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
a
good
spacer
beer
at
8
99
a
case
it
has
its
niche
on
draft
served
cold
in
7oz
old
man
glasses
and
an
attentive
bartender
to
keep
thiem
coming
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
experience
in
cans
eh
brewed
at
the
lion
in
wilkesbarre
pa
a
retro
classic
it
pours
a
clear
golden
body
beneath
a
creamy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
an
average
collar
and
leaves
only
minimal
spotty
lacing
about
the
glass
the
nose
displays
sweetish
malt
and
not
much
more
perhaps
a
subtle
touch
of
yeasty
sulphur
there
are
no
noticeable
hops
its
medium
bodied
smooth
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
offers
a
lightly
sweet
and
gently
crisp
maltiness
with
just
a
touch
of
yeasty
fruitiness
it
finishes
short
and
drying
with
a
touch
of
residual
sweetness
an
enjoyable
and
refreshing
basic
americanstyle
lager
natty
boh
is
a
baltimore
institution
and
the
king
of
the
supercheap
macros
although
quality
has
suffered
since
pabst
bought
the
brewery
and
you
can
no
longer
get
the
boh
in
kegs
this
beer
is
still
a
hero
to
students
and
baltimores
working
class
if
you
ever
see
this
at
a
liquor
store
and
youre
looking
for
a
dirt
cheap

3
9912pack
near
me
alternative
to
high
life
busch
etc
buy
a
case
of
this
and
toast
the
land
of
pleasant
living
this
is
a
cheap
beer
where
you
get
what
you
pay
for
nothing
more
nothing
less
there
was
nothing
foul
here
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
as
a
lawnmower
beer
sort
of
tastes
like
a
better
light
beer
theres
an
oxymoron
theres
not
much
you
can
say
about
these
lawnmower
beers
they
go
down
great
on
a
hot
day
but
leave
much
to
be
desired
in
the
flavor
category
this
is
typical
of
the
name
brand
american
lagers
with
a
high
percentage
of
adjuncts
for
the
money
though
on
a
cost
per
can
basis
a
much
better
value
than
the
big
labels
cheers
rated
from
notes
on
previous
tasting
ok
beer
better
that
some
domestics
overall
i
havent
had
labatt
blue
in
25
years
and
i
remember
it
being
more
shall
we
say
drinkable
i
dont
know
if
my
taste
buds
changed
or
if
they
tinkered
with
the
recipe
but
this
is
terrible
i
want
to
like
this
but
its
just
another
adjunct
beer
heavily
marketed
around
here
i
guess
moderate
carbonation
made
the
mouthfeel
ok
and
it
is
not
completely
offensive
when
cold
corn
aroma
and
taste
become
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
perhaps
it
gets
a
gold
star
for
nostalgia
sake
hey
listen
its
not
on
the
top
of
the
list
of
awesome
craft
beers
but
in
a
pinch
1
15
for
a
24oz
it
works
and
isnt
bad
plus
when
your
friends
come
over
for
football
they
will
relish
drinking
an
import
instead
of
miller
or
bud
32
bottle
clear
pour
not
very
thick
or
heavy
minimal
smell
not
many
flavours
while
tasting
minimal
carbonation
its
truly
an
awful
beer
overall
bland
beer
with
added
sugar
to
compensate
still
feels
relatively
fresh
i
dont
understand
some
of
the
reviews
top
rated
beers
are
nasty
and
some
of
my
favorite
are
ranked
6
or
7
ive
tried
the
beers
that
are
ranked
high
and
have
to
ask
why
ive
read
the
reviews
and
dont
get
it
i
think
if
its
not
bac
over
5
9
its
considered
piss
water
but
flavor
that
doesnt
make
me
squeal
and
want
my
eyes
to
water
isnt
a
qualifying
factor
for
a
great
beer
for
me
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
this
is
a
better
one
great
appearance
with
color
and
head
nose
is
a
weak
spot
though
with
some
cereal
grain
and
hint
of
canned
veggies
but
the
flavor
on
the
palate
is
a
decent
maltygrainy
taste
with
balance
of
hops
to
make
it
have
some
overall
flavor
worth
enjoying
too
many
adjunct
lagers
seem
designed
to
have
as
little
flavor
as
possible
but
this
one
is
more
flavor
forward
and
a
decent
flavor
if
i
was
a
regular
adjunct
drinker
then
this
would
be
in
my
fridge
fairly
often
i
recon
ill
stick
ta
drinkin
dem
buds
my
only
problem
is
that
the
bottles
are
only
11
5
oz
and
cans
are
12oz
hey
do
the
math
regardless
im
a
big
fan
of
blue
not
so
much
blue
light
i
love
the
taste
and
color
its
a
beer
that
serves
many
purposes
great
for
getting
a
buzz
great
for
relaxing
and
great
for
watching
sports
cant
really
go
wrong
with
labatt
blue
tastes
like
spoiled
rice
did
not
pair
well
with
the
barleywine
i
was
drinking
at
the
time
awful
beer
dont
know
what
it
looks
like
because
i
drank
it
out
of
a
can
straw
colored
beer
not
much
happening
here
in
the
way
of
flavor
i
like
it
oh
yeah
one
of
the
worst
aal
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
honestly
cannot
believe
people
regularly
drink
this
crap
all
in
all
this
beer
is
a
somewhat
better
adjunct
lager
than
others
ive
had
namely
budweiser
miller
or
coors
however
as
with
any
adjunct
lager
i
advise
this
be
very
cold
when
you
drink
it
or
the
funky
sweet
grain
and
corn
notes
will
come
alive
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
itll
be
much
harder
to
drink
but
this
beer
does
have
a
nice
crisp
smooth
finish
to
it
other
than
that
its
got
all
the
qualities
of
a
typical
adjunct
lager
easy
drinking
better
than
domestic
us
beers
light
in
body
and
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
and
smooth
an
ok
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
must
be
served
very
cold
goes
bad
fast
once
warm
shared
a
pitcher
with
the
bowling
team
they
always
have
a
different
7
pitcher
and
this
week
was
labatt
wow
was
it
bad
ugly
traw
colored
body
taste
like
stale
bud
with
some
sugar
water
added
i
dont
mind
when
the
7
pitcher
special
is
pabst
coors
or
miller
but
this
stuff
was
terrible
we
ended
up
not
finishing
the
pitcher
great
beervery
floral
and
refreshing
pours
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
only
a
slight
lacing
heavy
carbonation
mild
flavor
but
not
watery
hints
of
citrus
and
nutty
bitter
finish
easy
drinking
a
very
good
everyday
beer
even
if
unremarkable
has
a
hint
of
wallpaper
paste
its
certainly
not
a
great
beer
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
poor
as
the
ratings
imply
its
got
a
little
flavor
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
its
one
of
the
better
beers
in
its
price
range
ok
is
what
i
would
call
it
great
beer
full
flavor
i
just
like
this
it
is
mostly
a
historical
liking
on
my
part
but
its
a
nice
standard
pilsner
for
a
cheap
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
not
bad
its
definitely
no
craft
beer
but
i
always
like
a
good
labatt
once
in
a
while
really
boring
not
as
gross
as
corona
or
the
like
but
super
boring
no
flavor
aroma
to
be
had
here
but
it
was
cheap
and
its
refreshing
with
food
i
guess
when
i
lived
in
north
carolina
for
several
years
blue
was
as
expensive
as
any
craft
beer
in
the
store
so
i
chose
other
options
take
from
that
what
you
will
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
in
a
calgary
pub
devoid
of
other
options
there
is
a
decent
chance
that
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
tried
when
i
was
probably
around
8
years
old
it
tasted
awful
back
then
and
is
marginally
better
now
this
was
once
a
bestseller
out
here
in
the
west
along
with
molson
canadian
and
the
still
ubiquitous
molson
pilsener
but
has
since
receded
into
the
background
as
tastes
have
evolved
and
as
other
macrobreweries
have
gained
ascendency
since
the
80s
and
90s
a
pale
straw
color
and
almost
devoid
of
aroma
beyond
a
vague
sweet
graininess
you
might
read
things
about
the
blue
jacket
on
certain
western
canadian
barley
varieties
that
imparts
a
distinctive
dryness
sure
whatever
although
it
is
indeed
the
case
that
this
brew
is
more
crisp
and
dry
than
many
of
its
adjunct
lager
competitors
features
a
very
subtle
fruitiness
that
evokes
apples
and
grapes
a
generic
white
bread
maltiness
almost
no
hop
aroma
or
flavor
a
massive
dose
of
carbonation
and
a
faintly
metallic
semidry
finish
i
think
this
compares
favorably
to
something
like
the
massively
sweet
sleemans
original
draught
but
you
might
be
better
served
saving
such
comparisons
for
tickers
like
myself
who
keep
finding
themselves
in
places
that
remain
craftphobic
i
do
not
get
the
same
nostalgia
here
that
molson
pilsener
evokes
at
least
its
union
made
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
free
hat
they
offer
as
a
promotion
with
the
nhl
or
mlb
would
i
recommend
it
as
a
pilsner
no
but
if
you
are
at
the
bar
with
some
friend
you
can
always
have
a
glasse
of
it
this
was
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
not
horrible
id
drink
it
again
its
perfect
for
a
weekend
relaxing
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
o
if
youre
near
canada
and
your
options
are
domestic
lights
and
labatt
blue
take
the
blue
otherwise
get
something
else
this
beer
was
just
okay
for
me
it
was
not
my
favorite
beer
to
me
it
did
not
taste
good
it
was
ok
but
i
have
had
better
the
aroma
was
ok
as
well
i
personally
could
just
taste
the
alcohol
more
than
the
flavor
in
thos
beer
i
do
not
know
maybe
i
got
an
old
one
but
this
was
just
me
but
i
am
not
going
to
try
to
put
down
any
beer
because
everyone
has
their
own
taste
and
likes
this
is
the
epitome
of
average
in
terms
of
beers
remarkably
lacking
a
body
or
a
real
strong
flavor
and
feeling
like
a
domestic
beer
playing
dressup
in
imported
beers
clothes
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
surprisingly
very
flat
and
doesnt
bear
much
taste
although
i
wouldnt
say
it
isnt
drinkable
and
likely
easy
to
session
i
will
try
to
see
if
i
can
pick
up
other
labatt
flavors
throughout
the
rest
of
the
year
light
royale
light
lime
max
ice
etc
but
these
beers
after
the
disappointing
flagship
brand
will
be
one
of
the
last
i
seek
out
especially
since
finding
single
bottles
of
some
of
them
proves
to
be
a
grating
challenge
and
i
doubt
ill
be
able
to
drink
a
six
or
twelve
pack
of
these
before
they
expire
if
theyre
anything
like
regular
blue
overall
eh
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
although
ive
quaffed
quarts
of
it
during
band
practice
good
rehydration
beer
overall
this
beer
is
your
average
north
american
adjunct
lager
its
not
horrible
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
gave
me
one
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
a
six
pack
as
far
as
canadian
beer
goes
i
prefer
molson
overall
i
do
not
like
this
beer
although
there
is
something
nice
about
it
which
i
cannot
place
high
school
nastalgia
sorta
yuck
ok
for
what
it
is
overall
a
decent
lager
i
would
have
this
again
if
the
price
is
right
overall
taste
overall
this
is
a
brew
that
is
simply
ok
better
than
some
other
adjunct
brews
ive
had
would
i
buy
it
again
maybe
i
have
had
it
before
and
i
am
drinking
it
now

this
brew
has
an
avb
of
5
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
this
brew
looks
like
american
style
lager
nothing
good
but
nothing
bad
the
smell
is
goodhas
a
rich
smell
of
beer
at
this
point
im
liking
this
brew
now
for
the
taste
at
first
you
get
some
richness
but
goes
away
fast
after
that
it
is
just
flat
and
than
nothing
to
me
it
tastes
like
flat
bud
light
it
is
smooth
but
the
taste
there
is
nothing
there
mouth
feel
is
ok
it
reminds
me
of
a
light
beer
i
can
not
tell
the
5
0
abv
i
feel
if
there
was
more
of
a
taste
this
brew
i
would
like
it
better
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
out
of
5
not
the
worst
brew
i
had
but
not
the
best
overall
a
below
average
american
lager
low
c
to
me
its
the
budweiser
of
canada
the
cocacola
and
the
mcdonalds
ya
know
the
meh
the
widely
distributed
the
average
no
disrespect
to
any
of
those
corporations
ya
pay
a
little
more
in
the
states
with
it
being
imported
the
color
and
mouthfeel
is
light
and
uneventful
but
not
offensive
slight
tracing
in
the
glass
goes
away
quickly
dont
get
me
wrong
a
drinkable
beer
a
buyable
beer
drank
it
in
toronto
and
thought
it
was
better
there
on
tap
leaves
a
heavy
sharpy
alcohol
residue
on
the
tongue
so
i
wouldnt
recommend
combining
it
with
other
brews
as
for
me
taint
bad
a
very
simple
biere
bottled
clear
and
golden
with
a
white
head
it
has
a
sweet
smooth
taste
of
hops
and
malt
throughout
could
swear
there
is
an
after
taste
of
wine
grape
skins
overall
this
is
a
mass
production
beer
that
is
a
little
different
than
other
canadian
beers
ive
tried
theres
nothing
to
complain
about
and
nothing
remarkable
either
this
run
of
the
mill
beer
goes
with
anything
you
want
to
drink
beer
with
enjoy
the
color
is
way
too
weak
to
have
any
real
respect
and
the
nose
holds
little
to
no
personality
despite
the
lack
of
nose
i
found
the
cereal
grain
and
light
pilsner
malts
to
be
better
than
average
there
is
an
easy
drinkability
but
its
highly
carbonated
and
very
crisp
overall
its
not
the
worlds
best
pilsner
but
it
will
do
in
a
pinch
we
sometime
try
to
fortify
the
taste
by
mixing
it
with
quality
brews

so
it

overall
revisiting
a

i
had
over

the

is
much
shorter
than
the

i
felt
holding

then
cookiecutter
and
mouthrinsing
with
little
to
suggest
a

o
overall
yeah
well
you
know
already
just
another
fizzy
yellow
drink
that
the
masses
drink
however
i
am
able
to
stomach
this
more
than
its
competitors
its
alright
overall
pretty
mediocre
but
better
than
some
of
the
swill
offered
in
bars
if
im
looking
for
something
in
this
style
though
im
looking
canadian
as
its
better
than
this
obviously
anyone
enjoying
this
i
recommend
serving
it
cold
and
a
frosted
mug
while
not
my
thing
wouldnt
hinder
this
beer
in
any
manner
o
definitely
a
beer
to
try
my
good
friend
tried
it
and
labatte
became
his
all
time
favorite
beer
this
has
always
been
my
favorite
a
distinct
taste
with
this
beer
great
and
amazing
taste
of
canada
plain
uninteresting
boring
dull
lifeless
this
beer
seems
like
a
lighter
very
of
pbr
overall
its
a
typical
aal
which
is
to
say
not
very
good
within
that
classification
its
neither
the
best
or
the
worst
of
the
bunch
overall
a
poor
beer
and
one
that
i
would
not
drink
again
a
step
below
pbr
and
even
other
mass
produced
adjuncts
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
seem
as
watery
compared
to
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
style
theres
no
off
flavors
o
this
is
a
nostalgic
beer
for
me
lots
of
labatt
blue
was
consumed
when
i
was
a
college
student
in
upstate
ny
during
the
early
to
mid
1990s
not
really
any
better
than
i
remembered
it
being
but
not
horrible
aside
from
the
mouthfeel
labatt
blue
is
a
respectable
adjunct
lager
this
might
be
good
lawnmower
beer
or
a
budgetminded
pounder
during
hockey
season
overall
this
is
a
quality
canadian
lager
anyone
who
appreciates
a
simple
yet
refreshing
brew
can
appreciate
this
no
need
at
all
to
bash
it
as
it
does
indeed
have
its
place
in
the
beer
world
it
would
be
easy
to
be
a
beer
snob
and
belittle
this
it
is
not
what
i
would
pick
most
of
the
time
but
there
really
wasnt
anything
wrong
with
it
it
is
a
bit
blah
to
my
liking
but
was
fine
with
for
the
social
gathering
and
would
likewise
be
fine
to
cool
off
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
warm
day
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
slight
vegetal
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
slightly
below
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
vegetal
quality
i
am
getting
in
the
flavor
isnt
too
enjoyable
the
flavor
has
light
malt
up
front
slightly
obscured
by
the
highly
carbonated
quality
with
gentle
hop
balancing
the
light
sweetness
wout
any
real
depth
or
complexity
in
taste
overall
a
pretty
bland
lager
just
ok
without
any
real
noticeable
flaws
in
the
flavor
department
not
recommended
based
on
enjoyment
it
isnt
bad
per
se
unless
you
expect
the
taste
of
malt
or
hops
fun
fact
if
you
purchase
labatt
from
one
of
canadas
liquor
stores
which
close

vanish

and
co2
is

a
very
common
north
american
lager
that
is
rather
unremarkable
overall
classic
beer
reminds
me
of
hockey
and
enjoying
a
game
with
a
cold
one
i
was
not
a
big
fan
of
labatt
blue
the
only
time
i
ever
tried
it
while
sitting
around
a
camp
fire
for
a
field
trip
in
grand
marais
michigan
i
was
given
one
of
these
beers
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
horrible
while
the
taste
of
it
wasnt
much
better
i
may
give
it
another
try
sometime
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
o
pretty
good
one
of
the
best
adjunctsmacros
approving
of
this
staple
will
enjoy
from
timetotime
you
know
what
it
is
worse
than
coors
light
nothing
good
about
it
overall
this
is
a
dry
bright
macro
brew
less
sweet
than
coors
and
molson
less
skunky
than
stella
more
personality
than
budweiser
and
miller
the
first
beer
i
ever
drank
was
labatt
blue
in
a
red
solo
cup
it
was
the
beer
we
brought
to
the
park
before
we
were
old
enough
to
drink
in
bars
and
probably
what
i
drank
the
night
i
kissed
my
first
college
girlfriend
my
tastes
have
changed
since
then
but
i
still
consider
it
a
great
beer
for
parties
camping
trips
tailgating
and
other
situations
where
you
just
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
watery
beer
with
your
friends
for
all
the
massproduced
north
america
beers
out
there
this
one
tastes
the
best
keep
in
mind
make
sure
you
drink
it
cold
or
it
wont
taste
good
perhaps
its
bc
there
are
no
preservatives
in
this
beer
anyway
this
beer
actually
has
a
pleasant
taste
no
aftertaste
and
is
best
among
beers
priced
in
the
same
catagory
such
as
bud
miller
lite
and
coors
you
know
as
the
cheap
after
hockey
beers
go
i
dont
mind
this
in
the
craft
context
its
obviously
crap
but
in
the
cheap
beer
world
its
decently
solid
the
pour
is
of
course
an
adjuncty
piss
color
with
a
marshmallowy
white
head
nose
is
watery
malts
generic
yeast
and
a
touch
of
aluminum
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
nose
slightly
less
off
bready
malts
a
lot
more
flavor
than
the
blue
light
aftertaste
is
a
little
metallic
but
comparably
less
so
drinkability
is
high
with
a
pretty
light
body
and
very
active
carbonation
it
turns
the
stomach
a
bit
which
has
to
knock
it
down
a
peg
but
after
a
hockey
game
or
on
the
golf
course
there
is
a
lot
worse
you
can
do
for
yourself
than
one
of
these
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
isnt
delicious
but
its
alright
its
an
adjunct
lager
if
im
not
mistaken
so
no
sense
getting
too
much
into
the
taste
it
has
a
decent
beer
taste
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
as
ot
warms
it
leaves
a
slight
filmy
coating
in
the
mouth
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
ice
cold
with
friends
and
youll
have
a
good
time
overall
i
like
it
a
lot
better
than
any
other
cheap
beer
ive
had
i
give
it
the
relatively
negative
reviews
that
i
have
because
its
just
a
weak
pilsener
with
no
real
substance
as
a
beer
it
is
ok
but
as
a
pilsener
its
terrible
the
appearance
is
ok
and
the
smell
too
but
the
taste
isnt
good
for
a
pilsener
the
mouthfeel
is
average
tough
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
certainly
below
average
in
general
this
beer
is
fine
but
it
isnt
a
pilsener
i
would
definetly
give
it
a
3
if
it
was
a
normal
lager
overall
id
definitely
choose
this
over
some
other
cheap
beers
of
its
kind
id
choose
this
over
some
other
american
beers
of
this
variety
to
be
honest
probably
my
goto
aal
when
its
available
inoffensive
and
actually
kind
of
enjoyable
definitely
my
favorite
cheap
brew
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
wont
be
having
it
again
unless
it
is
the
only
decent
option
poured
into
becker
pint
glass
light
fizzy
yellow
with
minimal
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
fast
into
a
thin
ring
of
foam
that
leaves
no
lacing
at
all
smell
is
weak
mostly
grain
malt
strong
on
corn
a
little
grassy
hop
smell
is
barely
noticeable
im
having
trouble
picking
out
any
specific
thing
in
the
taste
to
describe
its
incredibly
watery
with
thin
flavors
of
corn
and
not
much
else
finish
is
metallic
and
dry
overall
its
drinkable
but
almost
literally
tasteless
its
not
offensive
ill
give
it
that
but
only
because
there
are
no
flavors
strong
enough
to
be
offensive
but
i
guess
thats
the
goal
of
the
aal
style
to
be
inoffensive
to
the
largest
amount
of
people
in
that
this
beer
if
you
can
call
it
that
succeeds
your
typical
macro
lager
nothing
special
here
overall
not
offensive
but
also
lacking
on
flavor
may
it
be
offensive
or
not
overall
drinkable
and
about
what
i
expected
not
terrible
but
not
great
either
just
a
small
step
above
your
average
adjunct
lager
tastes
better
than
most
of
its
adjunct
competition
and
in
canada
is
usually
a
bit
cheaper
as
well
if
im
looking
for
24
beers
for
29
99
to
drink
on
a
summer
afternoon
at
the
beach
rather
than
better
stuff
at
2
bucks
or
more
a
pop
ill
reach
for
blue
easily
the
best
tasting
beer
in
the
standard
section
of
most
supermarkets
labatt
blue
has
a
somewhat
distinct
taste
and
it
is
surprisingly
very
smooth
for
being
a
so
called
average
beer
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
for
about
7
which
is
a
great
price
for
what
you
get
muchhh
better
than
bud
light
this
beer
makes
me
wonder
why
people
even
still
pay
the
same
price
for
something
as
horrendous
as
that
famous
carbonated
piss
water
definitely
my
beer
of
choice
if
im
just
looking
to
get
a
quick
drunk
for
cheap
overall
it
is
stark
flavor
and
aroma
are
almost
nonexistent
so
all
the
bubbles
just
nip
and
nip
with
nothing
to
release
onto
your
tongue
overall
a
tolerable
and
ok
session
drinker
ive
had
more
refreshing
adjuncts
but
this
one
still
serves
the
purpose
ok
3
0
d
it
might
just
be
nostalgia
but
i
swear
this
isnt
as
bad
as
some
of
the
other
aals
ive
had
lately
theres
no
sickly
corny
sweetness
that
is
prevalent
in
others
overall
the
bud
of
canada
easy
to
drink
with
nice
flavor
best
when
cold
would
buy
again
poured
from
a
11
5
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
but
it
does
not
stay
very
long
at
all
doesnt
really
smell
of
anything
mainly
of
malt
if
anything
tastes
like
a
regular
adjunct
lager
just
a
little
better
than
most
it
is
light
bodied
that
is
not
overly
carbonated
and
is
definitely
drinkable
all
night
overall
a
slightly
below
average
beer
but
definitely
not
offensive
they
really
shouldnt
sell
this
beer
i
dont
know
how
they
stay
in
business
it
tastes
like
sweet
skunk
its
so
weak
though
it
could
be
a
lot
more
objectionable
ive
actually
had
a
lot
worse
but
this
is
definitely
not
worth
drinking
overall
the
first
one
was
good
it
all
went
downhill
from
there
but
still
a
decent
grilling
beer
just
for
a
change
of
pace
once
overall
this
beer
is
very
popular
in
my
area
but
this
is
actually
my
first
time
trying
it
its
not
the
greatest
beer
out
there
but
its
not
terrible
i
dont
understand
why
so
many
people
buy
it
though
overall
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
its
subtle
flavor
profile
and
light
body
and
aromas
make
it
very
easy
to
down
like
water
likely
would
be
good
on
a
very
hot
day
when
served
very
cold
otherwise
nothing
to
pine
over
and
just
pretty
ordinary
overall
this
is
almost
alcoholic
water
i
swear
miller
lite
has
more
flavor
than
this
i
havent
tried
many
canadian
beers
but
the
ones
i
have
tried
including
this
one
all
tasted
quite
the
same
they
all
had
a
sweet
front
fading
into
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
and
the
color
is
nice
i
guess
i
need
to
try
more
canadian
styles
so
i
will
have
a
better
understanding
much
like
canadians
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
which
is
perhaps
its
biggest
strong
suite
its
nice
that
there
wasnt
any
noticeable
corn
flavors
in
this
brew
and
while
far
from
impressive
the
cereal
grains
translate
into
a
simple
and
clean
brew
i
would
take
this
over
most
of
the
mexican
and
american
adjunct
lagers
that
i
have
sampled
so
far
and
would
even
consider
purchasing
it
as
a
plain
simple
no
frills
cheap
beer
for
the
summer
o
the
first
time
that
i
recall
having
this
beer
i
liked
it
that
was
in
canada
and
about
11
years
ago
its
better
than
bmc
its
a
slight
bit
darker
than
the
light
version
which
isnt
saying
too
much
mild
malt
scent
o
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
im
glad
the
cans
i
got
were
free
cant
recommend
this
one
at
all
this
stuff
had
some
taste
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
its
average
with
nothing
really
going
for
it
except
its
cheaper
and
you
can
drink
it
like
water
so
yeah
its
only
poor
by
a
beer
connoisseurs
standards
but
to
the
lay
person
its
among
the
better
major
domestic
brews
final
thoughts
labatt
blue
markets
itself
as
the
good
stuff
however
unless
you
are
comparing
it
to
a
buck
a
beer
good
stuff
it
is
not
unlike
in
the
states
where
bud
and
coors
seem
to
be
the
macro
standard
up
here
in
canada
its
molson
canadian
and
labatt
blue
this
is
representative
of
what
canadian
bulk
brewing
has
to
offer
so
yeah
o
run
of
the
mill
aal
would
take
it
if
offered
to
me
for
free
but
wouldnt
spend
money
on
it
overall
drinkability
meh
is
about
the
best
i
can
say
when
its
very
cold
there
is
still
something
there
but
as
it
warms
up
its
all
gone
and
at
that
point
you
really
have
to
chug
the
stuff
fast
to
get
much
of
anything
out
of
it
taste
and
appearance
average
for
this
style
of
beer
and
nothing
special
but
not
bad
might
be
good
during
a
hot
day
but
otherwise
im
not
impressed
oh
well
not
everything
can
be
good
labatt
blue
is
typical
beer
from
north
america
pours
golden
clear
with
thin
white
head
that
eventually
dissapates
the
smell
and
taste
include
mostly
grains
and
subtle
hop
to
clear
the
pallet
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
drinkable
o
there
was
a
time
when
i
looked
forward
to
going
to
syracuse
to
visit
an
old
college
roommate
he
swore
by
this
stuff
then
mainly
i
think
because
it
was
cheap
and
perceived
as
fresh
having
come
not
too
far
from
canada
but
now
when
i
go
to
syracuse
i
visit
blue
tusk
and
drink
good
beer
for
what
this
is
its
ok
ive
had
worse
in
the
great
canadian
macro
lager
battle
this
loses
out
to
molson
fizzy
weak
odorless
and
just
kind
of
weak
tasting
with
a
distinctly
watery
and
undercarbonated
quality
theres
really
very
little
to
say
about
some
beers
just
that
i
found
this
had
even
less
taste
than
molson
and
what
was
there
was
tinny
overall
it
goes
down
easy
if
your
goal
is
to
chug
a
few
beers
at
a
tailgate
overall
this
beer
is
not
very
good
the
whole
grape
thing
was
just
odd
and
there
are
better
alternatives
out
there
for
aals
d
light
and
neutral
it
us
hard
to
say
anything
about
this
beer
good
or
bad
a
generic
adjunct
lager
overall
im
sorry
i
chose
this
over
the
molson
xxx
i
was
about
to
pick
up
hey
for
2
i
cant
be
too
mad
good
thing
ive
got
some
homebrew
in
the
fridge
to
get
this
taste
out
of
my
mouth
final
thought
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
bud
and
the
like
only
1
a
pop
not
bad
o
one
of
the
very
few
commercial
beers
out
there
that
i
would
buy
again
when
i
am
low
in
money
the
best
aal
out
there
a
brew
that
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
o
right
on
for
the
style
but
just
an
average
beer
for
me
probably
better
with
food
overall
my
hockey
team
swears
by
pitchers
this
stuff
after
games
i
guess
it
serves
a
decent
purpose
in
the
refreshingcheap
beer
department
not
something
i
would
select
at
1
25
for
a
24
oz
can
the
price
is
right
not
a
bad
choice
out
of
its
category
o
just
a
descent
all
around
beer
of
the
basic
cheap
beers
labatt
blue
is
a
favorite
easy
to
drink
and
as
refreshing
as
water
overall
i
recommend
this
for
anyone
looking
to
get
drunk
fast
easy
to
drink
not
bad
tasting
compared
to
other
similar
options
and
if
its
88
per
24oz
tall
boy
go
for
m
the
mouthfeel
is
dull
but
quite
drinkable
when
cold
im
guessing
that
i
could
have
gotten
through
the
can
in
under
five
minutes
overall
not
a
bad
beer
goes
well
while
watching
hockey
labatt
whatever
that
means
in
french
it
must
be
close
to
the
fword
i
brought
this
back
from
a
recent
trip
to
western
ny
seems
very
popular
in
downtown
alfred
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thinnish
white
head
that
dissipates

looks
like
carbonated
apple
juice
smells
of
grainy
malt
hints
of
honey
slightly
earthy

taste
is
grainy
grassy
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
medium
to
low
body
medium
level
of
carbonation
sweet
watery
mouthfeel
this
is
a
bit
better
than
a
typical
macro
lager
clean
a
bit
sweet
nothing
objectionable
just
nothing
remarkable
either
o
no
real
negatives
other
than
the
lack
of
substance
for
the
style
its
not
bad
none
of
those
metallic
or
overly
adjuncty
flavors
one
would
associate
with
this
style
for
beer
like
this
a
6th
catagory
should
be
added
for
sound
as
the
fizz
is
as
audible
as
a
can
of
coke
well
lump
that
into
appearance
smell
is
of
corn
taste
was
a
surprising
step
up
from
the
smellnothing
involving
but
a
pleasant
pilsner
sweetness
taste
does
not
reveal
itself
more
with
warming
rather
it
begins
to
break
down
despite
the
good
deal
i
got
it
was
a
mistake
to
buy
this
in
24
oz
cans
if
youre
going
to
drink
this
keep
to
small
serving
sizes
in
order
to
keep
it
cold
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
saaz
pils
like
hops
and
a
nice
maltiness
to
back
it
up
a
hop
bite
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
ok
better
than
most
but
still
standard
overall
this
is
a
slightly
better
then
average
adjunct
lager
that
is
good
for
an
after
bike
ride
session
beer
not
going
to
win
any
awards
but
it
does
the
trick
o
its
drinkable
but
why
would
you
want
to
maybe
to
cleanse
the
palate
and
make
way
for
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
however
it
wasnt
horrible
final
grade
2
94
a
c
o
this
was
my
college
beer
after
i
graduated
i
still
got
12
packs
once
in
a
while
to
drink
along
with
my
craft
beers
and
still
have
a
few
of
these
left
over
from
last
year
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
buzz
that
i
liked
better
than
most
of
the
other
aals
at
the
time
not
sure
if
i
would
still
feel
that
way
but
i
dont
really
drink
them
anymore
probably
my
first
time
drinking
this
in
a
glass
other
than
having
it
in
pitchers
at
the
bar
it
is
definitely
quite
sweet
but
does
have
a
little
more
bitterness
than
most
aals
imo
i
dont
really
see
my
self
buying
this
in
the
store
again
anytime
soon
but
will
revisit
it
at
the
bars
every
once
in
a
while
i
kind
of
wanted
a
canadian
adjunct
to
be
better
but
its
was
average
at
best
poured
a
bright
clear
yellowish
gold
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
smelled
of
rice
and
water
chemical
even
taste
was
not
so
bad
refreshingly
crisp
did
have
a
dry
rice
like
quality
but
drinkable
overall
a
drinkable
adjunct
but
unimpressive
on
a
good
day
o
fairly
drinkable
and
quite
inoffensive
but
it
is
definitely
not
above
mediocre
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
just
had
this
on
tap
a
few
days
ago
lets
see
how
it
compares
the
pour
yields
the
same
pale
gold
with
a
thin
white
cap
the
nose
is
just
a
mild
corn
grass
faint
citrus
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
refreshing
still
albeit
on
the
thin
side
the
flavors
seem
more
pronounced
from
the
bottle
though
i
think
that
has
more
to
do
with
the
icecold
glass
my
draft
was
served
in
how
i
hate
that
creamy
corn
light
malt
mild
bitterness
grainy
finish
not
a
bad
brew
id
reach
for
this
before
many
other
adjuncts
tried
for
the
first
time
while
at
comerica
park
in
detroit
for
a
tigers
game
the
beer
appeared
a
light
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
held
up
nicely
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
spotty
cap
the
aroma
was
kind
of
typical
light
and
grainy
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
better
than
expected
maybe
it
was
just
because
i
was
at
the
ballpark
but
i
felt
that
it
was
strong
than
most
in
its
class
but
still
grainy
with
no
real
hint
of
hops
it
has
a
light
feel
was
clean
crisp
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
personal
favorites
when
i
want
to
drink
a
quality
beer
at
an
affordable
price
whether
it
is
in
a
bottle
or
can
labatt
blue
always
seems
to
hit
the
spot
it
has
a
sweet
taste
to
it
with
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
its
a
lot
different
than
other
canadian
imports
as
a
result
of
that
sweet
taste
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
anyone
especially
someone
that
wants
a
quality
beer
without
spending
a
lot
of
money
odhave
had
much
worse
not
a
bad
macro
when
compared
to
a
few
others
probably
would
not
by
this
as
a
cheap
get
drunk
beer
because
its
a
bit
pricier
than
a
high
life
or
a
pbr
but
not
too
bad
would
drink
one
over
most
any
bud
or
coors
onot
impressed
will
buy
others
from
now
on
poured
into
a
pint
a
light
yellow
with
a
lot
of
head
that
died
down
fast
to
leave
almost
nothing
nose
is
nothing
short
of
any
other
mass
produced
lager
a
bitterness
and
pale
malt
if
anything
the
flavor
is
watery
but
with
a
brighter
grain
character
than
expected
a
light
bitterness
that
finishes
the
finish
has
a
light
sour
taste
ill
drink
it
if
im
handed
one
at
a
hockey
game
taste
is
corn
and
a
light
bitterness
but
not
of
the
hop
variety
very
bland
light
and
tame
skip
it
overall
labatt
blue
is
about
drinking
not
thinking
it
is
meant
to
be
consumed
quickly
without
tasting
it
hockey

beer

hot

cheap

drink
it

so
i
can
get

its
scary
to
me
that
i
still
occasionally
purchase
and
consume
something
so
frighteningly
meh
but
imprinting
is
powerful
and
the
buffalo
beer
gods
must
be
appeased

runs
twist
cap
at
your
own
risk
o
not
a
beer
id
drink
on
the
regular
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
if
im
offered
one
ill
take
it
thanks
this
is
my
grandads
favorite
beer
he
likes
it
in
paper
cups
and
thats
how
we
drink
it
together
somehow
drinking
ice
cold
labatts
out
of
7oz
paper
shooter
cups
while
gazing
out
at
a
lake
makes
it
taste
pretty
damn
good
but
for
the
more
formal
purposes
of
this
review
however
sorry
blue
and
i
mean
that
all
in
all
a
decent
if
only
a
little
underwhelming
beer
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
fairly
crisp
and
refreshing
but
nothing
about
it
is
noteworthy
better
than
the
alternatives
if
you
were
to
say
buy
cases
for
a
party
id
recommend
spending
the
extra
dollar
or
two
to
upgrade
from
bud
or
miller
to
this
labatt
blue
is
a
pretty
decent
drinking
beer
its
best
when
its
ice
cold
its
much
like
other
pale
lagers
yellow
in
color
dissipating
head
and
pretty
smooth
tasting
id
go
for
a
labatts
before
ever
going
after
miller
or
bud
this
beer
gives
us
some
good
flavors
and
it
could
easily
be
much
worse
drinkability
easy
to
drink
this
is
definitely
a
lawnmower
beer
that
you
can
knock
back
a
few
of
12
inch
fizzy
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
collar
around
the
top

of
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface

with
good

labatt

pours
a

theres
a
wispy
white
head
that
never
rises
in
stature
enough
for
there
to
be
even
a
chance
of
having
a
discussion
about
head
retention
or
lacing
what
nose
there
is
is
largely
of
pale
and
cereal
grains
and
just
a
little
bit
corny
a
faint
herbal
noble
hop
presence
is
a
pleasant
surprise
the
flavor
follows
to
a
t
and
im
struggling
to
temper
my
disappointment
in
the
relative
lack
of
flavor
with
my
expectations
of
the
style
the
body
is
predictably
watery
but
the
carbonation
does
show
some
signs
of
lifeassertiveness
all
in
all
labatt
blue
is
a
serviceable
macro
pilsner
but
then
again
i
always
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
still
pretty
easy
drinking
all
things
considered
but
it
gets
into
bubblegum

territory

this

is
not

some

less
than

some

not

else
mostly
watery
finishes
very
smooth
not
a
brutal
as
some
others
from
this
style
actually
very
refreshing
its
not
a
lot
different
than
water
but
thats
what
youre
looking
for
here
definitely
at
the
drinkable
end
of
this
style
d
excellent
much
like
the
water
that
makes
up
most
of
this
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
due
to
its
similarity
to
water
if
you
just
want
a
light
refreshing
beer
then
this
is
your
beer
passable
for
what
it
is
though
it
starts
getting
old
after
just
a
few
it
pours
with
virtually
no
foam
it
is
clear
yellow
smell
is
not
pleasant
and
the
taste
is
watery
with
a
hint
of
skunk
drinkable
maybe
if
im
on
the
lake
with
no
other
lager
in
sight
i
would
much
rather
have
a
keystone
they
both
taste
similar
and
one
is
a
heck
of
a
lot
cheaper
drinkability
is
pretty
good
when
this
beer
is
on
sale
i
dont
hesitate
to
pick
it
up
over
other
macros
just
to
have
something
in
the
fridge
and
its
probably
a
little
better
than
the
score
suggests
by
no
means
a
masterpiece
but
definitely
a
good

i
do

good
memories
drinking
this
stuff
my
freshman
year
of
college
up
around
erie
seemed
like
this
bmc
and
yuengling
were
every
where
you
went
to
drink
labatt
blue
is
a
buffalo
favorite
if
you
were
to
walk
into
any
bar
in
buffalo
your
sure
to
find
labatt
blue
or
blue
light
on
tap
or
in
bottles
labatt
blue
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
big
foamy
head
it
has
good
carbonation
and
clarity
the
aroma
is
light
with
rice
cereal
malts
and
grassy
straw
like
hops
the
flavor
is
delicate
with
some
sweet
cereal
malts
up
front
that
turn
dry
with
a
crisp
citrusy
bitter
finish
blue
is
light
bodied
thin
and
a
highly
drinkable
canadian
pilsner
its
a
great
beer
for
watching
hockey
go

or
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
traditional
buffalo
style
fish
fry
md
overly
carbonated
but
not
bad
very
drinkable
given
the
type
a
nice
canadian
beer
color
pours
dark
yellow
with
a
strong
yet
not
overbearring
smell
a
beer
you
can
have
by
the
pool
and
at
dinner
tastes
strong
but
not
overbarring
either
the
kind
of
beer
you
keep
in
stock
not
a
one
and
done
a
beer
you
can
keep
and
offer
up
to
friends
this
beer
is
on
a
level
with
the
millers
buds
corrs
nothing
at
all
special
d
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
especially
if
looking
to
tie
one
on
it
is
boring
and
uninteresting
and
would
make
a
great
party
beer
something
to
drink
but
nothing
spectacular
at
all
id
rather
have
a
pbr
otherwise
its
your
typical
corn
and
grain
tasting
macro
lager
it
seems
to
go
a
little
heavier
on
the
grainy
flavors
which
would
work
if
there
was
some
carbonation
to
clean
it
away
after
drinking
overall
a
beer
you
get
when
youre
having
a
ton
of
people
over
and
you
cant
afford
the
good
stuff
yet
people
love
it
so
youll
please
them
and
please
your
wallet
a
decent
social
drink
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
light
and
cheap
d
this
is
far
from
drinkable
however
if
youre
already
drunk
then
this
will
go
down
smoother
than
most
other
macros
on
the
market
warning
dont
drink
sober
djust
not
very
good
even
for
this
style
bud
of
the
north
kinda
thin
and
fizzy
although
the
drinkability
is
a
bit
above
bmc
if
this
is
your
bag
this
beer
is
very
canadian
sounds
better
than
the
american
version
but
really
is
just
a
different
take
dont
be
afraid
to
drink
it
without
though
actually
a
higher
quality
beer
than
expected
not
much
here
as
far
as
depth
of
taste
but
this
is
definately
an
upscale
beer
of
the
style
it
is
very
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
and
it
is
popularly
used
as
such
it
should
definately
be
chosen
over
many
american
rivals
but
does
not
have
any
miraculous
quality
for
being
canadian
nonetheless
its
still
a
basic
mans
basic
brainwashed
beer
the
bottom
line
is
that
while
this
is
far
from
the
premium
beer
that
many
americans
seem
to
think
it
is
its
inexpensive
easydrinking
and
a
bit
better
than
bmc
swill
if
my
budget
is
tight
when
im
shopping
for
some
weekend
brews
labatt
blue
will
usually
suffice
the
experience
got
better
as
i
creeped
along
this
beer
perhaps
i
got
used
to
the
adjuncts
there
are
imports
in
the
us
which
are
worse
and
more
expensive
than
this
but
remember
americans
i
sampled
mine
in
canada
where
its
considered
domestic
beer
i
would
take
a
labatt
blue
over
any
american
macrobrew
anyday
not
horrible
for
the
price
i
only
drink
it
after
i
have
had
something
else
that
is
good
on
draft
or
if
it
is
a
cheap
draft
at
a
bar
like
for
a
dollar
i
have
found
this
beer
is
a
little
more
tolerable
with
a
slice
of
lemon
in
it
color
is
yellow
with
white
head

if
you
are

to
order
the
second

can
drink
them
all

this
is
a
great
style
of
beer
but
within
the
style
labatt
is
not
bad
this
is
a
nice
steady
reliable
canadian
beverage
its
better
than
similar
american
staples
such
as
budweiser
but
not
spectacular
its
a
nice
golden
ale
presenting
nothing
special
upon
pouring
but
the
taste
is
nice
clean
and
mild
with
no

aftertaste
its
an
easy
beer
to
consume
on
a
hot
day
or
hanging
out
on

with

nothing
about
it
will
wow
you
but
its
a

steadygood
to
go
back
to
after
sampling
other
styles
drinkability
consumable
beer
seems
to
be
trying
hard
not
to
offend
i
remember
that
this
beer
used
to
have
more
character
than
this
i
was
hoping
to
find
a
decent
cheap
canadian
macro
here
going
on
memories
of
yesteryear
and
attracted
to
the
cool
blue
graphics
but
the
reality
is
this
beer
sucks
tried
to
drink
2
cans
on
2
separate
occasions
and
proceeded
to
pour
both
down
the
sink
its
sweet
evoking
dormroom
cleaner
it
tastes
like
adjunct
with
no
hop
for
a
goto
pilsner
style
macro
im
sticking
with
becks
i
had
three
of
these
tonight
only
thing
available
and
i
came
away
being
distinctly
unimpressed
as
far
as
macro
lagers
go
i
suppose
its
better
than
budweiser
but
still
very
generic
and
almost
watery
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
wouldnt
waste
my
money
on
a
such
a
forgettable
brew
too
much
rice
and
corn
in
this
one
i
think
because
you
cant
hardly
taste
any
hops
give
this
one
a
pass
its
made
for
the
market
that
doesnt
want
any
flavor
in
their
beer
drinkability
drinkable
as
in
not
filling
but
there
are
several
lagers
out
there
that
can
say
the
same
thing
but
taste
better
pours
a
typical
golden
yellow
color
with
minimal
white
head
average
smell
with
some
corn
some
grain
and
a
little
bit
bit
of
a
yeast
presence
taste
is
a
little
watered
down
with
a
nice
refreshing
carbonation
too
some
sweetness
comes
through
in
the
end
the
only
issue
with
this
beer
in
my
view
is
that
theres
a
twang
at
the
end
of
any
pull
from
it
some
people
might
like
that
hate
it
or
just
dont
care
d
refreshing
clean
and
easy
to
drink
as
a
thirst
quencher
but
molson
or
moosehead
make
a
much
better
canadian
macro
lager
sampled
qutie
a
few
lagers
and
pilsners
during
this
session
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
the
most
sulfuric
and
illbalanced
of
the
bunch
starts
off
with
a
typical
crystalclear
fizzy
carbonated
active
beer
with
a
head
formation
that
failed
to
retain
aromas
of
cereal
grains
adjuncts
and
light
pilsner
malt
are
dominated
by
sulfury
aromas
of
cooked
vegetables
corn
and
a
harsh
matchstick
burning
sensation
in
the
nose
flavors
also
pick
up
on
the
corn
flavors
from
sulfur
and
pilsner
malts
a
residual
cornlike
sweetness
proves
quite
distracting
a
followup
of
astingent
husk
flavors
and
green
apples
round
out
the
beer
a
bit
heavy
oily
in
the
mouthfeel
with
a
finish
that
emphasizes
the
unbalanced
sweetness

crazy
northerners
will

anything

bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
and
taste
are
both
representative
of
your
typical
macro
lager
flavors
with
some
faint
grainy
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
overall
there
is
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
brew
nothing
special
here
just
your
typical
macro
lager
that
simply
blends
in
with
bmc
pours
a
clear
straw
with
a
pure
white
loose
head
drops
quickly
to
almost
nothing
smells
typically
macroy
and
tastes
about
the
same
maybe
even
less
flavour
than
a
typical
macro
light
bodied
fizzy
nothing
really
interesting
here
theres
a
odd
chemical
smell
i
associate
with
clothing
stores
in
this
one
also
the
finish
is
a
touch
sweeter
than
the
average
not
terrible
and
oddly
not
as
bad
as
i
remembered
it
still
one
of
the
blandest
beers
ive
ever
had
i
wanted
to
pick
up

decided
on
this
instead
im

the

from

breer
are
a

yellow
with
1
finger
head
thats
bright
white
and
dont
last
and
no
lacing
at
allit
smells
kinda
green
and
hints
of
corn
and
it
tastes
refreshing
upon
first
swig
but
than
the
bitterness
kinda
kicks
in
along
with
the
green
and
skunky
aftertasteyou
really
notice
the
skunkiness
when
it
warms
upits
got
a
med
to
heavy
feel
to
it
with
the
carbonation
like
i
said
beforei
wont
buy
this
beer
but
will
continue
to
drink
it
if
my
buddy
keeps
offeringbut
drink
it
ice
cold
and
before
it
get
warmed
so
down
it
fast
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
plenty
of
light
fluffy
head
theres
a
very
very
faint
yeasty
scent
to
it
but
thats
about
it
it
really
doesnt
smell
like
much
at
all
doesnt
taste
like
a
whole
lot
either
its
very
clean
tasting
with
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
there
but
i
dont
detect
any
hop
or
malt
flavor
finishes
clean
surprise
surprise
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thin
overall
its
drinkable
mostly
because
theres
nothing
there
to
object
to
unless
you
object
to
flavorless
beer
d
overall
its
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
swilled
pours
a
mild
yellow
color
with
carbonation
that
fades
after
a
minute
very
strong
aroma
with
some
malt
somewhat
sweet
in
taste
with
a
weird
mouthfeel
somewhat
grainy
not
too
bad
but
again
nothing
really
impressive
i
forgot
the
last
time
i
had
blue
anyway
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
no
head
retention
or
lacing
ontap
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
weak
smell
to
it
which
consists
of
the
standard
corn
and
rice
malts
weak
taste
too
which
also
tastes
like
malted
corn
and
rice
this
beer
has
a
very
very
light
mouthfeel
and
is
highly
carbonated
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
but
lacking
in
taste
and
depth
drink
this
at
the
bar
when
you
dont
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
flavor
is
worse
than
i
expected
i
think
this
is
worse
than
even
the
big
light
american
macros
out
there
standard
mechanical
grainy
flavor
no
hops
just
as
watery
as
a
light
beer
which
is
depressing
this
is
also
my
first
review
of
a
really
big
macrolager
mostly
because
i
just
havent
had
much
since
i
started
reviewing
and
this
blue
reminded
me
why
that
is
revisited
this
one
when
i
needed
some
beer
to
parboil
some
brats
at
someones
lake
house
and
did
not
want
to
waste
any
precious
3fs
beer
this
is
a
light
straw
in
color
and
perfectly
clear
obviously
a
snow
white
head
as
for
aroma
i
was
able
to
detect
some
sweet
malts
and
adjuncts
along
with
just
a
hint
of
grassy
straw
taste
had
a
not
so
bad
light
malt
sweetness
that
was
balanced
by
carbonation
and
very
little
hop
bitterness
light
in
body
on
the
better
end
of
macro
swill
that
and
50
cents
will
get
you
a
newspaper
wow
i
didnt
expect
it
but
it
makes
sense
in
hindsight
this
tastes
worse
than
its
light
version
i
guess
the
additional
flavor
is
more
than
it
can
handle
if
youre
going
to
drink
this
beer
i
guess
the
key
is
to
not
let
it
warm
up
at
all
chilled
its
plain
and
sweet
but
all
sorts
of
nasties
come
out
with
warmth
lawnmower
applications
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
light
gold
without
forming
any
kind
of
head
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
suprise
considering
it
is
a
macrolager
style
there
are
actually
hints
of
hops
on
the
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
more
flavorful
than
your
typical
american
macro
lager
not
by
much
but
there
are
hints
of
hops
and
malts
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
little
bit
thicker
for
the
style
a
very
drinkable
lager
overall
i
was
impressed
this
is
a
step
up
from
from
the
usual
bmc
lager

a
try

that

either
taste
is
about

would

not

this

and
its

if
your
a

than
you
should
give
this
one
a

drinkability
is
okay
certainly
consuming
it
on
a
hot
day
or
at
a
hockey
game
labatt
currently
sponsors
hockey

in

will
enhance
your
experience
with
this

this
isnt
a
bad
macro
it
jsut
isnt
good
either
want
a
good
macro
drink
some
gumballhead
its
tasty
pretty
darn
drinkable
was
skeptical
so
i
had
2
more
this
was
tasty
i
would
say
this
beer
must
need
to
turn
quick
to
stay
in
form
but
maybe
it
just
hit
the
right
notes
that
evening
kinda
boring
eh
drinkability
i
would
recomend
it
for
a
frat
party
otherwise
i
would
keep
away
drinkability
hey
did
i
mention
this
beer
is
watery
and
nonoffensive
a
person
could
suck
these
down
all
day
the
beer
is
not
terrible
but
i
would
only
drink
this
again
if
it
was
free
and
nothing
else
was
available
straw
yellow
in
color
good
initial
head
kind
of
like
colored
water
smells
of
corn
and
vegetables
still
not
skunky
like
some
ive
tried
taste
is
similarly
mainly
corn
with
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
had
this
in
my
sunroom
where
it
was
hot
so
it
was
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
light
fairly
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
good
on
a
hot
day
i
definitely
prefer
the
better
brews
but
this
would
defintely
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
this
beer
is
absolutely
atrocious
there
is
no
flavor
to
it
whatsoever
it
is
like
drinking
flat
flavorless
soda
i
would
take
bud
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
it
is
truly
repulsive
due
to
its
absolute
lack
of
flavor
call
it
a
triplelast
resort
beer
it
isnt
terrible
it
can
actually
be
quite
refreshing
in
some
circumstances
think
a
hot
sunny
day
at
the
ballpark
has
a
thin
yet
consistent
mouthfeel
unlike
many
macros
the
carbonation
isnt
overpowering
weak
taste
a
bit
hoppy
but
not
much
else
there
due
to
this
weak
taste
and
thin
consistency
it
is
very
asy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
if
youre
not
looking
to
shell
out
the
cash
for
a
microbrew
but
for
a
couple
more
bucks
one
could
get
an
18
pack
of
american
macro
rather
than
a
halfrack
of
this
i
dont
see
much
of
a
quality
difference
between
the
two
even
for
the
style
just
not
a
good
beer
the
only
reason
i
can
think
the
bros
would
recommend
it
is
as
a
lesson
in
pain
and
appreciation
of
much
better
beers
ive
had
this
in
canada
before
and
i
swear
it
tasted
better
there
i
am
perplexed
i
usually
drink
cans
of
this
stuff
and
i
dont
like
it
for
the
style
i
have
even
expressed
the
thought
that
other
than
corona
it
is
the
worst
beerforthebuck
there
is
paying
import
price
for
macro
swill
too
carbonated
hops
just
taste
skunky
and
hard
to
get
drunk
off
of
which
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
macro
lager
not
the
same
on
the
18th
barrel
though
quite
a
different
story
this
requires
more
research
and
maybe
a
new
review
for
now
the
higher
rating
this
one
stands
overall
i
must
say
it
is
still
rather
refreshing
for
a
macro
on
a
hot
summers
day
cheers
forget
it
i
had
to
try
it
out
for
old
times
sake
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
beer
and
definitely
beats
most
american
macros
bottom
line
is
this
beer
always
tastes
a
lot
better
while
watching
hockey
pours
a
yellow
pale
color
some
carbonation
small
head
some
lacing
afterwards
the
smell
is
malty
but
skunky
the
taste
is
malty
watery
with
a
dry
finish
light
body
drinkable
if
given
for
free
i
remember
drinking
this
alot
in
ca
way
better
than
bud
or
coors
though
ok
this
is
not
my
standard
review
i
drink
on
rare
occasions
this
macro
larger
all
i
can
say
is
it
beats
budweiser
and
miller
for
the
price
paid
its
a
totally
clear
larger
that
is
a
totally
clear
straw
colored
larger
with
little
flavor
qualities
might
be
good
just
to
drink
with
food
as
a
byproduct
it
does
have
a
light
flavor
but
not
very
bold
i
have
to
begin
by
saying
i
remember
this
as
a
different
beer
a
bit
bolder
and
more
flavorful
that
this
tasting
needless
to
say
my
view
has
changed
in
the
macrolager
world
i
think
id
now
walk
somewhere
else
the
head
is
dense
and
disappears
quickly
has
a
strong
corn
smell
first
taste
is
of
sharp
cornalcohol
with
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
and
malt
coming
in
afterwards
the
mouthfeel
however
is
actually
quite
nice
the
aftertaste
is
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
mostly
corn
sweetness
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
but
there
is
no
head
or
lace
the
smell
is
dominated
by
corn
as
is
the
taste
this
is
quite
overwhelming
it
feels
overcarbonated
and
watery
overall
though
it
is
easy
to
drink
compared
to
others
in
its
style
poured
a
paule
yellow
color
with
abundant
white
puffy
head
that
quickly
fell
little
lacing
to
be
found
smell
is
minimal
with
only
a
slight
sweetness
to
be
found
taste
is
crisp
but
very
little
maltiness
or
hops
to
be
found
cold
and
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
but
not
much
else
had
labatt
blue
on
tap
at
the
cats
eye
saloon
in
athens
oh
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
with
very
little
head
it
smelled
a
little
bit
skunky
some
of
that
typical
macrobrew
smell
the
taste
is
not
good
couldnt
find
any
hops
or
any
other
good
flavors
had
a
slight
sweetness
overall
not
a
good
beer
for
any
purpose
this
is
probably
the
most
dead
average
beer
ive
ever
had
its
certainly
tolerable
but
also
very
obviously
unspectacular
color
is
dark
enough
that
you
probably
wont
mistake
it
for
bud
or
miller
but
not
dark
enough
that
youd
ever
mistake
it
for
say
pilsner
urquell
head
is
a
little
less
foamy
than
something
like
bud
but
still
not
very
stable
smell
is
of
a
little
bit
of
grain
with
the
adjunct
fortunately
towards
the
background
the
hops
are
pretty
light
but
at
least
detectable
taste
is
middle
of
the
road
too
the
grain
taste
is
there
if
a
little
bit
light
with
the
adjunct
once
again
just
barely
detectable
there
is
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
balanced
out
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
its
not
a
deep
flavor
but
its
stronger
than
any
of
the
big
3
so
i
choose
this
instead
of
the
other
bmc
offerings
canadian
budweiser

it
sells
for
less
than

when

i

that
of

this

not

to

taste

relatively
devoid

in

similar
to

of

is
just

to
remind

this
is

no

the
hops
are

its
is

and
you
can
drink
abunch
of
these
its
an

and
still
better
than

etc
i
remember
these
tasting
much
better
when
i
was

i
grew
up
in

the

there
are

about

to
the
fact
that
its
from

and
i
really
do
not

canada
all
that
much
either
way

it
tastes
more

faint
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
watery
the
drinkability
is
at
least
fair
there
are
many
pale
lagers
that
can

my
wife
really
likes
this
beer
and
every
so
often
i
get
hankering
for
it
myself
its
a
nice
beer
to
drink
if
you
want
something
that
you
dont
have
to
think
about
much
kinda
lika
an
old
pal
itll
just
come
on
over
and
watch
a
little
tv
or
play
some
dominoes
with
you
its
actually
a
blessing
to
have
friends
like
that
labatt
should
be
called
lablah
backdated
tasting
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
on
21sep03
this
post
is
based
on
notes
from
that
review
nondistinctive
there
are
better
not
recommended
it
beats
drinking
miller
sorta
i
guess
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
a
moderate
head
that
didnt
last
long
and
no
visible
lacing
aroma
is
slightly
hoppy
with
maybe
a
hint
of
grain
but
that
is
about
all
the
taste
is
that
of
most
macros
watery
weak
and
bland
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
because
there
isnt
much
flavor
to
get
in
the
way
labatt
blue
has
some
corn
and
fruity
flavors
and
i
think
it
is
somewhat
of
a
hybrid
of
soda
and
beer
goes
down
really
well
at
a
sporting
event
or
a
barbeque
or
something
but
nothing
too
memorable
the
price
of
this
stuff
is
the
only
reason
i
buy
it
every
once
in
awhile
poured
pale
gold
with
a
short
lived
foamy
white
head
slight
hop
aroma
with
some
corn
ok
mouthful
with
medium
carbonation
taste
was
typical
mass
produced
macro
style
with
no
off
flavors
unless
you
consider
corn
off
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
one
inoffensive
and
refreshing
enough
to
satisfy
thirst
at
a
summer
bbq
but
not
something
id
pay
for
light
gold
color
small
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
very
sweetish
a
light
bodied
light
tasting
pilsner
not
very
hoppy
some
citrus
mouthfeel
is
slightly
hoppy
crisp
and
refreshing
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
average
beer
not
skunky
this
beer
takes
me
right
back
to
high
school
i
grew
up
in
michigan
and
this
stuff
showed
up
at
alot
of
events
the
drinking
age
was
18
at
the
time
by
the
way
uninspiring
in
colorwatery
looking
pale
goldenalmost
a
shade
of
yellow
aromas
include
corn
and
more
filler
type
aromas
the
mouthfeel
is
ultra
carbonated
and
sodapopish
the
taste
is
almost
of
nothing
with
a
hint
of
beer
flavor
i
could
probably
stomach
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
baseball
game
but
id
need
a
hot
dog
to
give
the
beer
a
reason
to
existi
guess
it
would
wash
down
a
dog
ok
other
than
that
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
stuff
mouthfeel
is
ok
beer
is
slightly
harsh
as
if
it
wasnt
aged
long
enough
drinkabillity
is
just
ok
not
my
favorite
labatts
product
well
at
least
the
fishing
was
good
umm
not
good
not
bad
but
definitely
not
good
i
got
a
large
30
oz
can
from
a
neighbour
who
claimed
to
have
too
many
blue
this
poured
a
grainy
lemon
colour
with
a
head
that
was
too
large
hell
it
was
half
the
glass
and
it
took
5
minutes
too
settle
down
poured
again
this
time
much
slower
and
the
head
still
rose
since
this
is
a
huge
can
i
spilled
a
bit
of
the
head
to
try
and
get
more
actual
beer
smelled
of
lemon
corn
malt
corn
hops
corn
sweet
corn
corn
and
corn
tasted
very
citrusy
not
much
difference
from
the
bottle
version
if
i
remember
correctly
fizzy
mouthfeel
below
average
beer
good
for
the
masses
a
crystal
clear
golden
body
rests
below
a
short
creamy
bright
white
head
the
retention
is
limited
and
it
shortly
drops
to
a
thin
surface
covering
although
it
does
leave
some
thin
streaks
and
spotty
lace
the
nose
offers
a
twist
on
the
generic
beer
aroma
with
the
addition
of
some
mild
haylike
graininess
a
touch
of
fruitiness
and
some
very
background
hops
the
body
is
lightmedium
and
its
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
vibrant
carbonation
the
flavor
delivers
a
thin
sweetish
obviously
adjunctladen
theres
no
real
grain
flavor
present
malt
thats
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
it
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
little
residual
aftertaste
its
not
a
bad
massproduced
lager
by
any
means
in
fact
its
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
but
the
slightly
elevated
hop
bitterness
leaves
me
wanting
more
and
its
just
not
there
no
real
hop
aroma
no
hop
flavor
no
real
graininess
crisp
and
wellbalanced
but
lacking
in
character
this
heres
yer
draught
beer
in
canada
eh
i
remember
when
i
drank
this
and
thought
that
i
was
better
than
the
budweiser
people
because
i
was
drinking
such
a
higher
quality
beer
ah
memories
this
really
is
not
that
good
but
not
bad
either
very
light
piss
colored
with
no
head
which
makes
me
never
want
to
pour
it
into
a
glass
again
its
not
like
i
am
getting
more
flavor
eitherways
might
as
well
just
drink
it
from
a
bottle
adjunct
flavors
are
very
noticeable
with
a
slight
amount
of
dextrin
sweetness
too
expensive
to
buy
buffalo
is
a
drinking
town
and
this
is
our
beer
it
will
never
cause
anyone
to
wax
poetic
over
its
virtues
but
it
could
be
much
much
worse
body
is
waterlike
very
little
lace
on
the
glass
gets
worse
in
taste
as
it
warms
as
the
adjuncts
come
out
in
force
my
advice
is
unless
you
want
to
swill
down
beer
like
no
tomorrow
and
could
care
less
about
taste
and
body
go
for
it
and
i
always
advise
going
with
anything
that
is
not
made
by
ab
so
again
go
for
it
personally
i
would
look
for
a
micro
any
micro
before
drinking
any
macro
beer
ever
again
pours
a
very
pale
color
with
light
carbonation
very
sweet
corn
syrup
smell
with
a
slight
hint
of
grain
and
hop
a
very
light
tasting
beer
with
somewhat
decent
flavor
fairly
sweet
and
lightly
bitter
overall
its
an
easy
to
drink
beer
thats
refreshing
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
definately
not
something
i
would
drink
if
i
wanted
flavor
not
a
very
drinkable
lager
maybe
if
im
trapped
in
a
snowed
in
cabin
in
the
yukon
with
a
case
of
this
i
might
try
it
again
this
is
a
clean
beer
but
not
as
clean
as
its
main
competitor
molson
canadian
the
smell
isnt
the
best
and
the
adjuncts
are
much
more
noticeable
than
molson
i
recommend
this
as
a
swillin
beer
and
nothing
else
definitely
a
party
beer
at
best
blue
is
siginificantly
better
on
tap
it
goes
from
one
of
the
most
overrated
beers
to
one
that
is
not
all
that
bad
not
to
say
its
transformed
to
a
good
beer
it
is
meerly
better
appearance
and
smell
is
much
the
same
except
it
has
a
slightly
more
yeasty
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
also
more
yeasty
therefore
somewhat
more
interesting
this
really
improves
its
drinkability
i
threw
back
quite
a
few
without
problems
or
shame
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
little
white
head
nothing
very
noticable
or
exciting
in
the
aroma
i
was
actually
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
flavor
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
even
more
watery
than
it
was
this
beer
is
nothing
special
but
for
an
americancanadian
lager
it
is
pretty
good
i
had
no
problem
downing
many
the
night
i
had
it
of
course
that
could
be
because
i
had
just
completed
my
first
successful
black
bear
hunt
and
was
celebrating
all
around
this
is
slightly
less
than
average
beer
mostly
like
an
average
macro
lager
it
has
more
graininess
and
body
than
some
the
light
gold
or
yellow
appearance
is
matched
to
a
quickly
dissipated
white
head
watery
mouthfeel
and
standard
carbonation
add
little
to
the
overall
sense
of
enjoyment
lots
better
than
bud
but
thats
not
saying
much
positive
medium
faded
yellow
color
thin
white
bubbly
head
smells
were
mostly
of
slightly
roasted
corn
aluminium
shavings
and
sour
beer
watery
sweetness
dominates
the
taste
corn
water
finishes
the
feel
a
faint
hop
presence
as
it
finishes
watery
and
harsh
to
get
down
flavors
got
rougher
after
it
warmed
a
bit
a
decent
ballpark
beer
but
i
switched
to
water
after
2
stay
hydrated
thats
the
key
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown

in
a
standard
pint

what
taste
there
is
was
sweet
no
hops

to
speak
of
unless
youre
buying
em
ill
pass
not
a
good
beer
i
cant
think
of
anything
good
to
say
except
that
its
not
horrible
its
what
you
drink
if
you
know
the
bar
hasnt
had
an
order
other
than
bud
or
bud
light
in
a
few
years
i
keep
hearing
about
it
being
better
in
canada
sorry
its
still
garbage
living
in
detroit
i
spend
too
much
time
visiting
our
neighbor
to
the
south
windsor
and
i
can
say
its
no
better
on
either
side
of
the
bridge
i
actually
think
blue
light
is
better
at
least
you
can
pound
it
faster
to
get
it
over
with
sickly
pale
gold
hue
translucent
brilliant
white
head
that
reached

id
be
hard
pressed
to
say
this
beer
is
any
better
that
an
american
macro
while
i
once
thought
of
labatt
blue
as
premium
and
exotic
i
now
realize
that
it
is
swill
the
beer
is
a
reasonable
change
from
heavier
and
maltier
ales
when
you
are
looking
for
a
thirst
quenching
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
golden
in
color
with
no
head
or
lace
when
it
was
brought
to
my
table
typical
beer
smell
with
a
little
hop
nose
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
just
not
much
to
it
tastes
like
a
slighlty
above
average
macro
thin
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
watery
taste
it
cooled
down
my
mouth
after
an
order
of
buffalo
shrimp
but
left
me
wishing
i
had
ordered
carryout
and
eaten
this
at
home
with
a
real
beer
better
than
budweiser
imo
this
beer
would
not
offend
a
soul
and
because
of
the
light
carbonation
would
make
for
very
easy
drinking
things
that
come
to
mind
the
bear
singing
with
the
japanese
men
no
you
didnt
no
you
didnt
aside
from
a
good
marketing
plan
please
do
not
confuse
the
canadian
blue
with
its
exported
counterpart
yes
taste
is
similar
but
the
original
is
full
bodied
with
a
slight
after
taste
and
not
as
sweet
and
a
tad
lighter
in
colour
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
temporary
white
head
bland
adjunct
flavor
no
real

the

is
hard
to
give
anything
but
a

the
aroma
was
very
faint
hops
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
the
high
carbonation
but
watery
thin
flavor
deserved
an
average
mouthfeel
i
gave
it
above
average
drinkability
however
as
it
is
one
of
those
beers
you
can
throw
back
and
not
notice
you
are
drinking
beer
ie
macro
lager
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
but
not
bad
i
had
this
beer
at
a
recent
summer
party
not
much
aroma
the
taste
was
mildly
sweet
and
grassy
very
little
hops
watery
mouthfeel
unfortunately
theres
not
much
to
add
ordinary
borderline
bad
not
something
id
want
to
have
to
drink
that
often
either
even
if
it
was
handed
to
me
at
a
party
a
run
of
the
mill
cheap
american
lager
with
a
funny
smell
and
a
bland
taste
there
are
so
many
other
beers
even
macro
beers
that
are
better
than
this

it

macros
hey
this
is
great
beer
my
friend
tells
me
then
again
his
favorite
is
bass
ale
well
i
gave
it
a
shot
not
surprisingly
it
sucked
tried
it
later
on
draught
and
it
was
still
no
good
light
and
mediocre

a

contribute
to

not
quite
the
weird
aftertaste
of
many
macros
ordinary
in
many
respects
but
i
appreciated
a
restrained
carbonation
wheres
the
lawn
mower
about
the
only
lighter
beer
i
can
enjoy
it
is
a
beer
you
dont
have
to
think
about
too
much
as
you
drink
it
a
small
step
up
for
the
typical
ab
crowd
right
now
i
am
chilling
down
the
last
beer
to
see
if
i
can
get
that
wow
taste
back
this
beer
has
the
typical
color
of
most
of
the
macrobrews
nothing
special
about
it
but
it
does
drink
fairly
decently
which
gives
it
points
over
alot
of
its
american
counterparts

head
unpleasant
chemical
aroma
hey
the
taste
aint
bad
at
all
not
at
all
it
has
a
typical
canadian
taste
but
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hops
without
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
get
in
the
way
for
a
macrolager
i
think
its
giving
my
pbr
a
run
for
its
money
typical
of
a
canadian
export
clean
crispt
and
simple
light
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
head
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
but
slightly
fizzy
and
bitter
but
in
a
good
way
very
drinkable
just
a
poor
poor
beer
the
smell
is
awful
and
strong
ultrathin
aftertase
like
you
were
sucking
on
a
battery
my
first
experience
with
labatt
blue
was
quite
a
forgettable
one
i
suppose
we
got
a
skunky
batch
because
the
smell
was
absolutely
horrific
it
was
similar
to
that
of
rotten
pork
it
was
indescribable
since
then
i
have
had
a
few
more
of
these
in
bottled
form
and
they
are
at
the
very
least
drinkable
the
smell
also
was
not
there
later
on
but
still
nothing
great
a
little
too
pricey
considering
it
really
isnt
much
better
than
the
cheaper
beers
out
there
but
if
swill
is
your
thing
here
you
go
better
than
alot
of
its
peers
well
the
previous
reviews
were
all
over
the
board
for
this
one
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
little
head
that
sticks
around
smells
of
adjuncts
but
the
medium
body
and
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
make
up
for
that
all
around
a
nice
tasting
lagerpilsener
sort
of
reminds
me
of
high
life
a
little
bit
definitely
better
than
most
macros
within
its
style
canadas
version
of
bud
notes
water
anyone
for
those
of
you
that
appreciate
hardly
any
flavour
body
aroma
or
beers
that
you
can
suck
down
just
like
water
here
you
go
seriously
this
beer
is
a
great
alternative
to
budmillercoors
anyday
not
as
clean
as
these
other
big
boys
but
its
different
so
if
those
are
the
sort
of
beers
that
you
are
into
why
not
make
a
switch
to
labatt
blue
for
a
change
lots
of
body
malt
is
slightly
sweet
and
hops
are
mild
and
good
enough
to
get
the
job
done
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
very
bland
empty
bodied
beer
not
for
me
was
our
go
to
while
in
thailand
as
there
was
not
much
else
was
a
good
value
but
did
come
with
a
vicious
changover
clear
golden
bubbly
body
with
a
soap
bubbly
head
that
thins
quick
thin
sweet
grass
aroma
faint
malt
and
spice
taste
clean
and
crisp
finish
tried
this
at
a
local
thai
place
way
to
dry
and
flavorless
not
much
to
say
about
chang
specifically
cheap
bad
beer
from
thailand
piss
yes
it
is
bland
and
boring
but
nothing
unpleasant
like
some
of
these
aals
a
touch
of
sweet
malts
in
the
finish
easy
drinker
that
pretty
much
goes
down
like
water
i
could
easily
polish
off
a
few
of
these
in
a
warm
climate
and
isnt
that
kind
of
the
point
of
these
export
aals
goes
perfectly
well
spice
thai
food
besides
that
its
pretty
flavorless
refreshing
boring
and
a
bit
unpleasant
beer
that
lacks
character
quite
expensive
too
i
am
at
my
hotel
in
bangkok
this
is
crappy
thai
beer
its
6
so
its
doing
the
job
a
little
better
than
the
5
piss
available
dont
expect
anything
spectacular
tastes
like
singha
tiger
san
miguel
asahi
or
any
other
asian
piss
had
one
while
waiting
for
my
takeout
at
my
local
thai
restaurant
i
have
to
say
its
not
terrible
and
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
pretty
bad
reminds
me
a
bit
more
of
a
czech
pilsner
thanan
adjunct
lager
definitely
has
a
sweet
malt
backbone
that
beers
of
this
type
dont
usually
have
no
particularly
off
flavors
and
i
have
to
attribute
that
to
its
51515
sell
be
date
in
truth
its
actually
pretty
good
so
based
on
the
reviews
ive
seen
get
one
of
these
fresh
if
you
can
or
dont
bother
pretty
mucha
carbon
copy
of
the
aroma
profile
mildly
sweet
with
orange
and
mandarin
and
a
slightly
sour
nip
at
the
end
so
it
is
like
eating
a
mandarin
that
is
just
on
the
turn
overall
a
suprisingly
tasty
beer
i
will
try
to
find
a
fresher
version
to
see
if
it
improves
any
not
a
good
beer
very
sweet
taste
almost
no
hopsbitterness
detectable
aroma
is
the
same
probably
some
dms
drink
it
cold
overall
slightly
better
than
i
had
expected
this
beer
is
not
dreadful
and
with
some
spicy
food
it
is
drinkable
but
it
is
not
one
i
will
ever
buy
again
and
i
would
never
serve
it
to
real
people
between
chang
and
singha
i
prefer
singha
this
is
what
i
expected
an
imported
probably
mass
produced
beer
from
from
thailand
did
i
actually
expect
more
the
color
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
it
is
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
small
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
thr
glass
and
gently
nudging
the
top
of
the
beer
head
was
fast
and
gone
just
as
fast
tiny
lacing
aroma
is
kind
of
like
a
damp
skunk
taste
also
is
like
a
damp
skunk
lol
seriously
it
is
an
ok
beer
that
i
would
drink
very
cold
when
i
am
looking
for
a
quick
buzz
and
i
can
pound
a
few
of
them
not
a
exciting
beer
was
it
worth
the
8
dollar
a
pack
yea
i
suppose
and
sure
it
was
more
warmly
received
in
my
circle
then
a
budweiser
or
corona
but
i
can
go
the
rest
of
my
life
without
it
and
would
rather
spend
money
on
something
else
drinkabilityoverall
overall
has
the
character
of
a
typical
massproduced
lager
fairly
refreshing
at
first
and
i
could
picture
drinking
it
in
absence
of
other
choices
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
other
than
that
i
would
not
want
to
try
it
again
and
barely
did
not
mind
trying
it
in
the
first
place
o
not
great
there
are
better
lagers
in
asia
drink
if
free
but
if
choose
something
else
if
its
available
o
a
mediocre
aal
o
citrus
pale
lager
not
too
much
flavor
almost
watery
however
very
drinkable
reminds
me
of
the
japanese
beer
asahi
dry
goes
down
smooth
and
is
the
type
of
beer
that
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
at
a
barbeque
on
a
sunny
day
nothing
special
very
little
aroma
and
after
taste
im
having
a
really
tough
time
rating
this
beer
it
has
a
certain
adjunct
laden
taste
that
is
unappetizing
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
fairly
drinkable
even
if
a
little
sweeter
and
less
balanced
than
i
prefer
i
can
think
of
better
tasting
asian
brews
but
this
one
is
tolerable
if
its
all
you
can
find
it
is
clean
and
reasonably
crisp
even
if
quite
bland
and
plain
overall
a
light
inoffensive
lager
that
succeeds
in
being
a
good
complement
to
spicy
foods
its
not
as
bad
as
some
of
the
reviews
claim
hop
fans
will
want
to
look
elsewhere
as
the
hop
flavor
is
almost
nonexistent
although
it
does
provide
a
little
bitterness
to
counteract
the
malty
sweetness
this
should
not
be
classified
as
an
adjunct
lager
as
it
is
an
allmalt
beer
and
its
maltiness
is
its
most
pleasant
characteristic
the
bottle
i
drank
was
near
the
sellby
date
so
while
it
was
pretty
drinkable
i
am
sure
it
would
have
been
better
10
months
ago
overall
really
uninspiring
even
for
a
cheap
import
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
just
like
any
other
asian
pale
lager
and
in
many
ways
it
is
it
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
pale
strawyellow
color
topped
by
a
fizzy
white
head
and
there
is
almost
no
discernible
aroma
other
than
a
mild
mustiness
and
a
faint
graininess
the
flavor
does
have
a
bit
more
character
than
most
though
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
and
a
nicely
sweet
cereal
malt
character
overall
this
beer
isnt
going
to
be
something
i
search
out
but
it
went
just
fine
with
a
nice
green
curry
had
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
really
good
green
curry
i
am
fairly
familiar
with
this
beer
from
years
of
eating
in
thai
restaurants
but
usually
choose
singha
here
chang
gets
the
formal
review
treatment
a
pale
straw
yellow
beer
maybe
just
veering
towards
lemon
with
minimal
white
foam
even
when
poured
aggressively
aroma
is
primarily
cooked
vegetable
dms
old
malt
and
a
nondescript
spice
note
i
might
be
getting
a
hint
of
lemon
or
some
other
dried
out
citrus
fruit
palate
is
also
dominated
by
dms
doughy
pale
malt
that
evokes
cheap
white
bread
and
low
key
grassy
hops
coupled
with
the
odd
apple
juice
or
artificial
banana
fruity
note
that
pokes
out
here
and
there
diacetyl
thin
super
fizzy
and
finishes
crisp
and
clean
despite
the
sweet
start
although
i
did
notice
a
propensity
to
get
sweeter
and
a
bit
rank
as
the
beer
warmed
up
its
a
standard
american
adjunct
lager
from
asia
cooked
sweet
bland
i
choose
singha
for
a
reason
this
is
much
worse
than
its
local
competitor
singha
and
also
behind
our
local
mass
adjunct
lagers
awkward
flavor
with
lots
of
offflavors
with
a
low
drinkability
to
toss
it
a
sin
i
at
any
cost
overall
drinkability
surprisingly
enjoyable
and
very
nonoffensive
o
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
easily
and
not
too
filling
since
there
isnt
much
to
the
beer
mild
kick
typical
representation
of
style
its
not
completely
bad
but
there
are
many
other
beers
even
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
o
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
with
how
great
it
tastes
but
needs
more
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
its
honeybreadytobacco
taste
sad
to
think
that
the
only
redeeming
quality
of
this
beer
is
to
put
out
the
fire
if
you
eat
spicy
food
a
very
plain
adjunct
lager
that
should
be
sold
at
pbr
prices
i
am
disappointed
by
all
aspects
of
this
beer
going
out
on
a
limb
to
try
a
new
beer
is
not
always
rewarding
food
match
thai
vietnamese
cambodian
indonesian
cuisines
all
work
with
beers
like
chang
again
its
all
about
washing
down
that
curry
nothing
more
nothing
less
pairs
well
with
an
anthology
of
chinese
experimental
music
19922008
well
its
one
of
the
worst
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
overal
a
decent
lager
and
a
vast
improvement
over
the
last
time
i
had
it
the
beer
is
not
very
impressive
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
if
it
was
hot
outside
i
could
see
myself
chugging
three
or
four
of
these
maybe
even
on
the
golf
course
this
is
not
my
first
beer
from
thailand
and
i
am
sure
it
wont
be
my
last
but
this
is
nothing
worth
writing
home
about
if
you
are
out
and
it
is
the
same
price
as
whatever
domestic
you
are
offered
try
it
oh
and
if
you
are
in
thailand
try
it
of
course
you
have
to
try
it
over
there
overall
nothing
too
special
but
easily
drinkable
would
be
even
better
with
less
carboantion
overall
impression
did
not
enjoy
at
all
meh
just
another
bland
characterless
massproduced
lager
hardly
any
flavour
or
aroma
probably
quenches
your
thirst
in
a
hot
climate
but
no
great
shakes
otherwise
no
need
to
seek
it
out
rjt
o
a
tasty
brew
but
nothing
memorable
it
paired
well
with
my
pad
thai
but
i
would
prefer
a
lot
of
more
flavorful
beers
to
pair
with
my
thai
dish
o
no
this
wasnt
great
it
was
an
addin
on
a
mixed
sixer
better
than
a
lot
of
other
green
bottle
imports
of
this
style
you
know
for
the
asian
mass
beers
i
kind
of
like
this
one
especially
decent
with
authentic
thai
food
as
was
the
case
last
night
at
bangkok
cafe
on
the
corner
of
hampden
and
downing
poured
into
a
frosted
metal
mug
a
good
head
rose
up
smell
was
off
extracty
and
chemical
but
not
offensively
so
just
not
maybe
as
fresh
as
it
could
be
flavor
really
isnt
bad
middle
of
the
road
malt
profile
with
just
a
touch
of
pseudohop
bitterness
to
crisp
things
up
in
the
finish
feel
isnt
bad
either
very
light
body
and
good
carbonation
kind
of
stits
in
the
belly
weird
and
could
be
filling
despite
its
lightness
i
remember
running
amok
on
these
during
songkran
on
the
streets
of
bangkok
its
a
good
party
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
a
little
light
on
the
flavor
and
aroma
but
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
obviously
this
would
pair
well
with
spicy
food
due
to
the
sweetness
something
i
would
likely
order
again
when
out
for
thai
food
as
most
of
the
thai
restaurants
in
the
area
stock
thai
beers
and
this
one
is
a
little
bit
superior
to
some
of
the
others
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
the
brew
was
how
it
evened
out
through
the
flavoring
and
how
nicely
it
finished
for
the
style
it
was
nicely
balanced
and
not
overly
sour
or
biting
with
the
adjuncts
and
mineral
bitters
there
was
a
creamy
pop
and
good
look
to
it
as
well
making
for
a
decent
beer
to
go
with
some
cheap
chinese
food
or
sushi
this
was
the
one
unusual
beer
in
a
crappy
liquor
store
in
palm
springs
calif
i
suppose
it
wouldnt
harm
too
much
to
give
it
a
try
in
a
thai
restaurant
but
otherwise
give
a
wide
birth
i
tried
this
beer
one
night
eating
out
at
a
thai
restaurant
the
waiter
insisted
that
i
try
it
the
color
was
a
dark
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
was
kind
of
skunky
with
a
normal
domestic
smell
mixed
in
as
for
the
taste
its
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
asian
beer
dry
and
bitter
out
of
a
bottle
this
thai
beer
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
the
retention
of
the
cap
was
average
and
it
left
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
adjunct
grains
especially
corn
along
with
some
light
sweet
malt
the
flavors
were
similar
dominated
by
the
corny
grain
with
some
hints
of
sweet
malt
bread
and
grassy
hops
behind
that
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
appropriate
passable
but
little
more
than
that
d
couldve
used
a
lot
more
body
and
carbonation
there
is
very
little
of
interest
here
this
lands
somewhere
between
an
american
adjunct
and
a
euro
pale
its
weak
subdued
but
in
the
end
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
probably
one
of
the
better
brews
thats
brewed
in
thailand
hard
to
choose
between
this
and
chang
extra
this
one
is
more
expensive
a
bit
more
refined
in
flavor
but
has
lower
alcohol
content
than
the
chang
extra6
5
try
it
and
see
for
yourself
overall
drinkability
possibly
the
best
american
adjunct
lager
ive
ever
had
and
its
not
even
made
in
america
keep
in
mind
im
rating
in
style
here
absolutely
great
in
style
id
almost
dare
to
say
i
hate
aals
but
i
actually
really
like
this
beer
the
delicateness
and
balance
of
the
flavors
reminds
me
of
the
westvleteren
blonde
i
dont
make
these
comments
lightly
d
easy
drinking
poundable
brew
say
what
you
want
but
for
an
adjunct
lager
this
isnt
that
bad
any
bits
of
flavor
are
a
good
thing
obest
served
on
a
hot
sunny
day
in
thailand
otherwise
better
off
with
something
else
d
would
be
much
better
with
more
carbonation
by
the
way
this
beer
looked
initially
i
expected
something
better
and
closer
to
a
pils
as
far
as
asian
pale
lagers
ill
go
with
a
rice
lager
like
sapporo
before
chang
overall
this
is
an
incredibly
accurate
representation
of
the
aal
categorybland
and
uninspiring
will
not
be
drinking
again
not
much
to
recommend
this
one
although
it
doesnt
have
any
obvious
flaws
and
works
as
a
good
beverage
to
accompany
a
meal
httpabarwithnoname

com
md
light
and
watery
just
like
a
macrolager
of
course
its
drinkable
but
really
good
for
parties
o
a
rather
nice
adjunct
lager
not
too
watery
overall
i
am
surprised
one
of
the
few
lagers
i
have
had
in
recent
months
that
i
didnt
struggle
to
finish
i
could
drink
this
with
a
good
curry
and
be
quite
happy
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
modest
white
ring
on
top
and
fair
lacing
on
the
chilled
pilsner
glass
the
aroma
is
firm
wheat
and
ricecorn
sort
of
breadiness
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
grainy
goodness
in
a
medium
light
bodied
brew
with
plenty
of
light
but
lively
carbonation
for
a
refreshing
feel
there
is
an
interesting
grape
idea
mixed
in
but
basically
this
is
just
another
international
generic
beer
that
is
plenty
drinkable
and
goes
good
with
food
feel
free
to
have
one
but
i
doubt
youll
be
motivated
to
stock
up
lighter
bodied
good
carbonation
not
hated
but
not
great
the
bitterness
works
but
there
isnt
much
else
to
this
one
very
light
flavors
straw
yellow
with
faint
haze
and
a
white
cap
that
quickly
disappeared
other
than
a
thin
collar
and
a
few
spotty
specks
clinging
to
the
glass
mild
aroma
dry
malt
extract
and
cooked
corn
sweet
with
cereal
graininess
a
little
grassy
the
flavour
is
poorly
balanced
too
much
sweetness
up
front
not
just
malty
but
nearly
sugary
grainy
character
with
bitterness
that
was
quite
low
yet
still
sort
of
harsh
and
sharp
a
bit
fruity
with
lingering
astringency
and
a
hint
of
spiciness
the
texture
wasnt
terrible
but
wasnt
appealing
either
low
to
medium
bodied
with
rough
carbonation
id
pass
on
this
in
the
future
even
if
it
was
free
not
the
most
flavorfull
beer
around
would
be
good
to
swig
on
if
your
eating
spicy
food
otherwise
only
worth
it
to
try
a
beer
from
thailand
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
drip
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
grains
and
corn
flakes
with
a
slight
honey
aroma
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
of
sweet
grains
and
corn
flakes
too
this
beer
has
an
average
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
lager
in
every
sense
nothing
too
bad
but
nothing
too
great
either
not
much
to
talk
about
good
if
you
want
a
modest
experience
t
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
smell
lager
yeast
some
faint
breadiness
maybe
a
touch
of
grass
and
some
grain
not
the
worst
but
far
from
the
best
the
beer
pours
a
basic
light
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
corn
and
grain
with
nothing
else
going
on
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
other
than
the
grain
i
get
a
little
bit
of
grass
but
that
is
it
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
outside
of
the
fact
the
beer
was
not
skunked
as
i
expected
it
to
be
i
dont
have
anything
else
nice
to
say
more
expensive
than
bmc
but
the
quality
is
in
line
with
them
a
very
light
dryish
aftertaste
a
very
forgettable
beer
not
really
good
but
not
really
bad
either
just
a
middle
of
the
road
straightforward
lager
a
half
step
above
the
average
american
macro
probably
for
not
other
reason
than
novelty
but
with
some
spicy
thai
food
it
really
hits
the
spot
nothing
to
drink
just
for
drinking
it
but
it
complements
food
well
enough
to
be
passable
not
much
of
a
head
that
was
gone
before
i
even
sat
down
slighty
cloudy
straw
color
smells
mostly
of
cerealcorn
w
some
grass
taste
is
typical
island
lager
style
refreshing
in
a
lawn
mowing
beer
kinda
way
at
least
its
not
crossing
that
sickning
sweet
threshold
and
does
taste
pretty
fresh
watery
and
lacking
in
the
carbination
department
thinking
this
would
probably
be
great
at
taming
a
spicy
plate
of
pad
kee
mao
thai
drunken
noodle
i
will
probably
seek
it
out
next
time
i
go
to
a
thai
restaurant
but
probably
wont
have
it
again
at
home
like
its
fellow
compatriots
offering
around
here
this
comes
off
better
than
expected
even
though
i
wasnt
having
thai
food
when
i
had
it
and
thus
i
cant
do
the
usual
ethnic
x
food
with
x
beverage
comparison
it
still
went
down
easily
i
suppose
and
was
agreeable
enough
for
this
typically
alltoo
underwhelming
style
an
innofensive
decenttasting
macro
lager
that
did
its
job
well
as
far
as
being
a
countryticker
brew
this
one
is
certainly
better
than
most
sometimes
all
you
need
is
a
pale
lager
o
not
a
bad
beer
it
sort
of
tastes
like
grain
belt
premium
a
bit
but
more
expensive
and
not
as
local
to
me
d
its
a
beer
very
much
akin
to
a
us
macro
brew
there
is
nothing
special
it
isnt
bad
but
its
far
from
good
pours
a
typical
clear
amber
with
not
much
head
but
this
may
have
been
a
result
of
the
way
it
was
poured
scanty
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
not
impressive
flavor
is
malty
and
a
little
fruity
average
but
still
palatable
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
fizzy
overall
an
average
beer
but
still
drinkable
this
one
is
better
for
a
party
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
dinner
rather
than
by
itself
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
with
very
little
head
the
head
that
is
present
disapates
very
quickly
its
very
similar
in
color
to
a
miller
lite
didnt
get
much
of
an
aroma
i
found
it
similar
to
iron
city
or
lone
star
and
the
taste
left
something
to
be
desired
as
well
it
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
domestic
light
beer
easy
to
drink
little
flavor
little
aroma
little
mouth
feel
little
aftertaste
end
i
had
it
at
a
thai
restaurant
straight
from
the
bottle
obviously
it
was
difficult
to
smell
but
slightly
sweet
and
a
hint
of
nondescript
hops
some
hop
flavor
and
balanced
light
mouthfeel
the
food
was
the
focus
and
the
beer
complimented
it
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
overallnot
too
bad
and
actually
goes
well
with
full
flavored
thai
food
still
judging
on
its
own
merits
its
an
ok
adjunct
and
nothing
more
had
12oz
bottle
at
thai
restaurant
yellowish
straw
in
color
noting
too
intriguing
about
the
color
yet
a
small
head
with
a
nice
small
consistent
lacing
through
out
the
whole
beer
a
slight
sweet
soft
candy
note
but
with
a
distinct
grain
backbone
a
little
corn
a
little
sweet
a
sweet
grainy
build
to
it
not
completely
off
putting
compared
to
most
american
adjuncts
light
bodied
but
not
watery
medium
carbonation
d
the
taste
isnt
all
that
bad
but
it
is
rather
grainy
like
rice
not
good
but
not
horrible
i
was
invited
to
a
thai
place
and
when
i
arrived
i
realized
there
wasnt
anything
for
me
to
drink
and
then
after
being
offered
this
i
was
surprised
to
say
the
least
my
perspective
was
that
this
is
gonna
be
another
crappy
adjutant
lager
well
it
wasnt
next
time
im
in
a
thai
place
ill
get
one
of
these
it
not
bad
this
could
work
fairly
well
with
a
spicy
thai
meal
but
as
a
session
brew
its
too
sweet
d
one
is
good
for
me
it
beats
out
a
lot
of
other
macro
adjunct
lagers
in
my
opinion
but
it
is
not
amazing
enough
to
merit
anything
above
average
fine
but
not
something
you
do
an
extra
effort
for
not
impressed
would
not
purchase
not
worth
trying
i
will
never
drink
it
again
overall
i
always
like
to
try
new
beer
so
i
enjoyed
the
opportunity
but
i
will
not
be
buying
this
one
again
cheers
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
really
stands
out
in
the
smell
or
taste
that
would
make
me
want
to
have
another
one
of
these
as
a
standalone
beer
i
guess
its
not
a
bad
accompaniment
if
youre
having
spicy
asian
cuisine
drinkability
really
the
flavor
is
kind
of
getting
to
me
on
this
one
its
very
mild
unpleasantness
is
just
sort
of
building
and
though
its
not
worthy
of
a
drain
pour
i
might
have
to
suck
it
down
quick
to
get
it
over
with
not
a
must
have
d
no
impressive
the
extreme
taste
of
adjunct
cereals
does
not
help
too
much
here
notes
not
even
a
decent
beer
if
youre
one
of
those
people
who
want
to
drink
one
while
you
eat
at
a
thai
restaurant
dont
its
not
even
worth
a
try
just
a
foreign
take
on
this
style
the
thai
have
some
problems
with
making
beer
from
my
experiences
330
ml
bottle
best
before
july
14
2010
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
average
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
grainadjuncts
not
much
else
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
its
all
maltgrainadjuncts
however
there
arent
any
offensive
aromasflavors
at
all
mouthfeelbody
is
light
and
also
crisp
drinkability
isnt
awful
its
not
exactly
enjoyable
to
drink
but
its
not
bad
to
drink
either
for
the
style
its
a
decent
enough
brew
ive
certainly
had
worse
d
i
could
have
several
of
these
fairly
quickly
on
a
hot
day
but
not
worth
it
for
the
money
d
well
this
beer
is
certainly
light
and
easy
to
down
pretty
much
like
any
passable
beer
of
its
type
it
has
no
offensive
flavors
which
is
a
plus
but
i
really
wish
it
had
something
going
on
to
peak
my
interest
alas
it
doesnt
its
basically
thailands
budweiser
d
not
very
tasty
although
goes
down
easily
on
its
own
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
once
the
food
started
rolling
it
did
pair
nicely
with
the
thai
food
that
i
was
consuming
d
good
for
cooling
off
all
the
spicy
thai
food
i
was
eating
but
not
much
else
this
is
basically
the
beer
i
expected
from
thailand
simple
light
and
quite
banal
its
not
good
beer
its
not
bad
beer
its
just
beer
kinda
like
budweizer
coors
or
high
life
not
something
i
would
offer
to
anyone
else
without
a
disclaimer
mouthfeel
is
typical
for
this
style
thin
smooth
and
whispery
drinkability
is
well
um
drinkable
it
certainly
goes
down
smooth
and
you
could
drink
them
all
day
long
but
why
overall
this
is
no
worse
than
the
major
american
examples
of
the
style
so
if
thats
what
youre
in
the
mood
for
why
not
give
this
brew
a
shot
bleh
this
is
just
another
crappy
macro
lager
its
sweet
and
vegetal
theres
a
sickly
sourness
in
the
aroma
that
is
offputting
the
head
fades
almost
immediately
and
a
pale
golden
glass
perfectly
calm
is
not
terribly
appetizing
the
flavor
lacks
for
hops
and
the
malt
tastes
cheap
and
adjuncty
this
beer
must
sell
solely
on
the
strength
of
its
country
of
origin
this
was
a
disappointment
even
as
a
curiosity
chang
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
green
11
15
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
grainy
maybe
a
little
grassy
i
might
taste
a
little
bit
of
malt
in
the
flavor
but
otherwise
its
just
grainy
light
easy
to
drink
but
has
a
bit
of
an
off
flavor
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
feel
and
drinkability
finish
is
semidry
feel
is
light
and
spritzy
this
is
one
that
ill
drink
but
not
necessarily
enjoy
but
ill
not
hate
it
either
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
either
is
it
worth
the
money
no
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
beers
like
this
shouldnt
be
as
expensive
as
they
are
d
east
to
drink
fair
impression
not
bad
but
would
not
drink
another
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
this
is
the
first
time
i
saw
this
beer
here
in
the
states
and
it
reminded
me
of
some
crazy
times
in
thailand
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
malts
taste
is
very
light
some
malts
and
grains
not
a
lot
going
on
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
very
mediocre
yellow
lager
with
a
decent
head
retention
that
sort
of
smells
like
fermented
apples
it
actually
has
the
taste
to
match
with
a
bit
of
bittersweet
undertone
i
was
surprised
at
the
taste
because
it
was
rather
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
medium
will
coat
the
inside
of
your
mouth
but
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
while
drinking
d
this
is
probably
the
lightest
most
waterlike
beer
ive
had
it
would
make
for
a
good
ballgame
or
lawnmowing
beer
but
thats
about
it
drinkability
glad
to
have
met
it
though
this
is
definitely
a
oneanddone
deal
for
me
while
it
is
by
no
means
great
thailand
could
certainly
do
much
worse
for
their
number
1
beer
sugarysweet
malts
are
the
chief
aroma
with
a
little
grassy
chaser
and
almost
nothing
in
the
way
of
hops
but
because
it
is
so
thin
it
is
easy
to
chug
down
that
may
not
necessarily
be
a
great
quality
but
there
you
have
it
a
slightly
skunked
smell
along
with
some
faint
stale
malt
not
pleasant
but
ive
smelled
worse
taste
is
suprisingly
less
skunked
and
matly
very
light
some
hops
comes
into
play
with
some
faint
spice
and
crispness
as
it
warms
it
becomes
a
bit
stale
still
not
bad
enough
for
me
to
pour
out
not
bad
drink
cold
was
out
last
night
at
a
thai
vietnamese
restaurant
and
ordered
a
chang
with
my
bowl
of
pho
poured
into
a
pint
glass
no
head
at
all
orange
color
looked
a
lot
like
apple
juice
smell
and
taste
were
barely
passable
as
beer
just
bland
and
no
flavor
had
to
add
a
few
drops
of
siracha
to
my
noodle
soup
to
get
some
kind
of
flavor
to
this
meal
as
this
beer
added
nothing
this
beer
is
too
much
like
water
just
something
to
drink
along
with
dinner
not
worth
trying
d
if
you
are
in
thailand
and
it
is
95
degrees
and
90
percent
humidity
i
can
see
where
this
would
be
worth
drinking
i
am
not
and
nor
would
i
drink
this
ick
really
bland
and
fairly
flavorless
until
the
skunky
bitter
taste
in
the
end
no
thanks
d
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
its
not
a
that
bad
but
its
not
good
enough
for
me
to
want
to
drink
more
than
one
however
i
could
not
recommend
this
not
a
clean
lager
by
any
means
you
have
to
feel
pity
for
the
people
of
thailand
if
this
is
their
topselling
beer
wed
certainly
prefer
a
solid
pilsner
or
ipa
over
this
beer
when
we
want
a
plate
of
pad
thai
all
in
all
pass
on
this
one
not
even
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
was
watery
thin
and
it
did
not
help
the
beers
drinkability
as
hinted
at
in
the
beginning
of
this
review
i
had
enough
in
the
bottle
for
a
second
serving
head
was
nonexistant
at
second
pour
sweetness
came
through
a
little
more
but
the
corniness
and
lingering
aftertaste
remained
though
by
this
point
the
aftertaste
was
less
distracting
the
beer
goes
down
easy
enough
but
im
just
not
impressed
by
the
flavor
ive
had
adjunct
lagers
as
session
beers
before
but
i
wouldnt
count
this
among
them
i
have
had
quite
a
few
of
these
changs
before
most
often
with
some
sort
of
chinese
food
i
will
continue
in
that
vein
and
otherwise
avoid
this
as
an
afternoon
thirst
quencher
overall
an
oddly
sweet
beer
that
is
very
one
dimensional
a
decent
example
of
this
ubiquitous
lifeless
style
m
d
sparkling
carbonation
and
finishes
pretty
smooth
and
clean
a
great
beer
it
may
not
be
but
its
not
what
i
would
consider
a
bad
beer
either
i
could
stand
sucking
back
a
couple
of
these
on
a
sunny
afternoon
without
complaint
d
good
pairing
for
eating
spicy
thai
food
this
complimented
my
extra
spicy
cashew
chicken
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
drinkability
refreshing
but
nothing
special
the
packaging
is
what
drew
me
to
this
just
an
average
beer
not
as
thin
as
a
typical
american
macro
but
the
rest
is
pure
massproduced
grainy
wannabe
pilsner
again
no
real
hop
to
be
found
in
the
taste
and
the
aftertaste
dies
immediately
after
the
swallow
still
id
say
this
is
better
than
most
factory
beers
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
thin
creamy
short
lived
head
smells
of
pale
malt
and
some
floral
hops
not
too
bad
flavor
profile
is
fairly
close
to
a
euro
pale
lager
thaineken
as
far
as
beers
that
you
can
get
in
thai
restaurant
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
did
a
fair
job
at
cooling
down
the
food
i
was
eating
reading
some
of
these
reviews
other
people
seem
to
have
had
a
different
experience
i
dunno
maybe
i
was
in
a
good
mood
d
all
in
all
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
not
my
first
choice
of
course
but
to
be
honest
not
my
worst
i
have
tasted
micros
that
i
would
put
below
this
in
terms
of
taste
doesnt
mean
ill
be
buying
it
anytime
soon
though
d
2
0
id
stay
away
from
this
i
would
only
accept
one
if
it
was
purchased
for
me
and
if
i
were
in
company
where
refusing
to
drink
it
would
be
an
insult
beyond
that
i
wouldnt
even
get
intentionally
drunk
off
this
beer
solid
pils
style
served
from
a
bottle
i
had
this
right
after
a
pu
and
this
showed
much
better
lighter
on
the
hops
but
with
a
perfect
malt
balance
it
actually
reminds
a
bit
of
the
easter
european
beers
maybe
just
a
touch
less
body
i
would
love
love
to
serve
this
in
a
blind
tasting
i
have
a
feeling
it
would
fool
plenty
a
beer
geek
typical
lager
no
great
depth
or
power
and
a
dry
aftertaste
left
in
the
mouth
ruined
the
tasting
for
me
tasty
beer
much
to
my
surprise
i
really
expected
a
forgettable
budweiser
clone
but
this
isnt
one
sweet
like
asian
lagers
tend
to
be
this
one
has
the
hops
to
make
it
all
balance
out
and
your
taste
buds
sing
you
can
still
drink
it
but
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
its
what
it
is
notes
i
had
this
with
thai
food
and
while
it
was
not
a
great
or
even
a
good
beerit
was
decent
enough
and
complimented
the
food
just
fine
there
are
better
beers
for
spicy
foodbut
this
did
well
notes
reminds
me
of
the
few
chinese
beers
ive
had
in
the
states
nothing
going
on
here
except
old
lager
if
i
had
to
have
a
far
east
beer
i
would
take
tiger
over
this
any
day
o
surprisingly
drinkable
theres
nothing
wrong
here
even
given
the
fact
that
we
were
dumped
with
out
of
date
product
the
curse
of
texas
it
seems
while
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
just
to
drink
i
would
certainly
order
some
with
thai
food
macro
lager
what
do
you
think
it
looks
like
nose
is
incredibly
sweet
in
that
insipid
can
a
smell
be
insipid
caramel
malt
with
a
healthy
dollop
of
ricecorn
im
sure
candy
that
this
kind
of
beer
often
has
flavor
is
sickly
sweet
as
well
reminds
me
of
rolling
rock
fortunately
theres
a
ton
of
carbonation
in
here
so
it
masks
the
flavor
fairly
well
overall
this
beer
is
bad
a
buddy
told
me
that
the
brewery
is
a
hot
mess
so
every
beer
tastes
different
but
i
tried
two
and
they
both
sucked
so
forget
this
pours
a
pale
yellow
colored
body
with
a
whitish
colored
head
and
is
somewhat
lasting
has
a
malty
somewhat
englishlike
aroma
similar
to
other
english
beers
ive
had
might
be
the
hops
has
a
pretty
grainy
taste
with
some
maltiness
somewhat
flattish
overall
i
never
thought
i
would
see
this
beer
again
but
it
was
part
of
the
beers
of
the
world
box
that
was
givin
to
me
by
my
cousins
girlfriend
for
christmas
i
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
d
the
dryness
in
my
mouth
after
this
beer
and
lack
of
flavor
gave
me
very
little
to
enjoy
here
chang
is
definitely
a
session
beer
there
is
nothing
too
strong
to
the
taste
that
would
stop
one
from
putting
down
a
case
of
these
with
ease
the
5
abv
doesnt
show
up
in
the
taste
which
may
be
dangerous
too
be
honest
this
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
after
the
look
and
smell
of
it
it
had
the
feel
of
a
us
macro
brew
it
has
a
sour
aftertaste
but
it
will
do
if
i
were
in
thailand
i
can
imagine
enjoying
a
few
changs
for
lack
of
other
beer
water
probably
would
be
a
better
choice
probably
my
favorite
asian
beer
to
date
poured
into
a
pint
glass
light
yellow
gold
with
a
snow
white
head
that
fizzes
out
with
medium
rapidity
and
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
is
strong
adjunct
mealy
corn
syrup
flavor
is
literally
almost
nonexistent
the
slightest
ricey
sweetness
and
the
ample
carbonation
make
this
just
distinguishable
from
water
ive
had
quite
a
few
absurd
pale
lagers
from
random
countries
and
this
one
is
still
astonishing
with
each
sip
in
how
thin
and
watery
it
is
at
least
its
inoffensive
it
is
what
is
simple
and
effective
nothing
about
this
beer
made
me
want
to
have
another
or
for
that
matter
even
finish
the
one
i
started
i
poured
one
glass
which
left
about
half
the
bottle
full
it
was
a
chore
to
finish
the
glass
and
the
rest
of
the
bottle
never
made
it
that
far
avoid
this
one
unless
you
enjoy
drinking
lousy
beer
as
noted
above
chang
beer
is
kinda
sorta
acceptable
as
a
food
washerdowner
theres
nothing
here
that
you
cant
find
at
your
local
quickie
mart
except
perhaps
a
fraction
more
bitterness
that
alone
will
turn
off
most
aficionados
of
real
american
macro
lagers
there
are
some
good
examples
of
quality
asian
lagers
however
this
one
is
definitely
not
working
smells
and
tastes
like
a
grapefruitflavoredjuice
mixed
with
formaldehyde
sweetish
and
sticky
this
one
might
work
in
a
patpong
bar
but
certainly
not
in
comparison
with
well
crafted
brews
jk
not
bad
d
i
would
not
recommend
this
one
to
anybody
this
is
just
not
good
at
all
didnt
even
taste
good
with
my
thai
dinner
well
its
as
drinkable
as
any
megalager
in
that
it
tastes
vaguely
like
beer
and
goes
down
easy
but
as
a
fan
of
craft
brews
this
doesnt
hold
any
further
interest
for
me
hey
it
has
a
cool
bottlecap
got
this
at
tongs
thai
on
austin
hwy
a
totally
drinkable
brew
not
great
as
ive
already
mentioned
but
not
all
that
bad
either
its
not
fancy
but
it
serves
a
purpose
a
fine
lawnmower
beer
for
those
who
want
to
seek
it
out
i
bet
it
goes
just
fine
with
a
spicy
curry
or
a
sweet
pad
thai
overall
i
thought
chang
would
be
something
fun
to
try
while
i
was
at
an
authentic
thai
restaurant
but
to
be
honest
i
was
highly
disappointed
when
i
got
the
equivalent
of
a
pocket
friendly
good
old
american
beer
cute
bottle
standard
straw
lager
color
small
white
head
recedes
to
nothing
grainy
aroma
not
especially
fresh
smelling
on
teh
mouth
this
was
not
skunked
but
did
not
have
a
refreshing
snaptasted
like
several
terribly
mediocre
asian
macrolagers
bland
bitterness
with
a
stale
malt
flavor
makes
singha
taste
great
tasted
on
5308
there
must
be
lots
of
lawns
to
mow
in
thailand
because
as
a
summer
lawnmower
beer
this
one
fits
the
bill
d
if
its
really
hot
youre
in
thailand
and
you
have
a
quarter
buy
a
chang
if
youre
in
the
us
use
it
to
buy
a
gumball
d
unless
you
find
yourself
in
thailand
getting
a
special
massage
avoid
d
nothing
special
here
but
the
higher
abv
may
bump
it
over
singha
the
taste
is
slightly
fullbodied
for
the
style
overall
rather
dry
although
it
has
a
light
sweetness
and
a
very
light
bite
the
flavour
is
very
light
being
mostly
apple
with
a
hint
og
grain
and
a
light
alcoholic
quality
as
it
warms
a
very
light
slightly
unpleasant
chemically
soap
quality
develops
especially
in
the
finish
d
it
has
a
light
body
but
a
funky
flavor
that
diminishes
the
enjoyment
of
the
beer
as
the
glass
emptied
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
that
will
likely
never
cross
my
lips
again
pours
with
a
white
threefinger
head
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
a
trace
of
lace
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
crystal
clear
pale
amber
color
nose
is
slightly
grassy
flavor
is
bland
some
sweetness
easy
enough
to
drink
but
so
is
water
would
make
a
good
lawn
mower
beer
1
85
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
another
bland
lager
nothing
to
see
here
drinkability
light
enough
to
drink
a
caseful
but
not
flavorful
enough
to
want
to
in
the
wide
world
of
beer
its
mediocre
but
its
good
for
the
style
aroma
is
more
akin
to
a
euro
lager
than
an
american
macro
faint
malt
and
floral
in
nature
tasted
mostly
sweet
with
a
faint
hop
bite
and
just
a
smidge
of
spiciness
medium
light
in
body
this
beer
would
certainly
pair
well
with
thai
cusine
and
i
wish
the
local
restaurant
would
stock
it
a
solid
macro
lager
easydrinking
for
the
warm
thai
climate
as
well
as
i
presume
spicy
thai
cuisine
you
dont
need
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
but
if
you
can
get
a
single
thai
it
try
it
a
pretty
poor
thai
beer
clear
yellow
with
no
head
and
nose
is
metallic
grain
taste
is
grains
with
slight
hops
on
the
end
but
an
odd
alcoholic
taste
like
turpentine
maybe
its
the
rumored
formaldehyde
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
drinkability
is
lacking
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
logo
maybe
it
would
be
better
served
with
some
spicy
thai
chicken
but
on
its
own
not
good
i
had
this
beer
in
a
local
thai
restaurant
down
the
street
i
am
a
man
who
loves
flavorful
food
and
flavorful
beer
i
poured
this
beer
in
a
pilsner
glass
that
was
given
to
me
and
the
head
immediately
disappeared
the
pale
yellow
hue
reminded
me
of
the
same
color
as
bud
light
the
beer
was
refreshing
only
because
it
was
cold
but
lacked
flavor
in
every
way
possible
i
suggest
to
everyone
to
pass
on
this
one
because
it
was
definitely
a
big
waste
of
time
try
singha
if
youre
in
a
thai
restaurant
and
dont
waste
your
money
or
time
on
chang
like
i
did
the
oe
of
thai
beers
beer
chang
has
that
artificial
sourness
of
a
beer
that
has
been
made
for
one
purposeto
get
you
drunk
appearence
is
what
youd
expect
from
a
cheap
lager
and
the
smell
is
similar
to
that
of
an
american
malt
liquor
i
usually
give
some
leniency
to
third
world
beers
but
in
this
case
there
is
no
reason
to
choose
beer
chang
over
its
drinkable
counterparts
best
thai
beer
ive
had
but
the
competition
aint
intense
still
leans
toward
the
ordinary
but
its
enjoyable
reminds
me
more
of
carolina
blonde
than
anything
else
go
figure
overall
keep
very
far
away
from
this
beer
use
only
to
wash
out
your
mouth
after
drinking
flaming
shots
of
mekong
as
previously
stated
the
main
benefits
of
this
beer
are
price
and
alcohol
content
deffinitely
give
it
a
try
when
in
thailand
but
dont
be
bothered
to
pay
the
export
import
price
unless
youre
looking
for
an
exotic
change
from
your
regular
mickeys
very
pale
straw
hued
with
a
shortlived
white
beer
head
and
a
moderately
carbonated
body
the
nose
is
pretty
modest
if
anything
with
some
malts
and
cornlike
grainy
smell
very
faint
trace
of
lemony
hops
the
palate
is
the
same
sharply
gassy
upfront
then
thinbodied
flavour
of
some
sweet
grains
and
sugars
but
turning
more
and
more
watery
as
it
goes
almost
like
a
lemonade
without
the
lemony
edge
finished
with
less
sugary
touch
than
its
previous
version
6
4
but
still
a
bit
sticky
on
the
palate
overall
it
has
all
the
cheap
and
overly
light
texture
i
havent
confronted
for
a
long
long
time
and
even
its
predecessor
tastes
better
than
this
one
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
and
not
as
a
result
of
mishandling
or
any
excusable
factors
i
believe
not
recommended
at
all
the
pour
clear
light
golden

color
the
head
adequate
as
is
the
lace
both
bright
white
in
color

somewhat

and
fresh

the
top
cadaverous
finish
bitingly
acidic
the

pertinent
to
the
style
dry
lingering
aftertaste
beats
water
sweeter
spanish
beer
smooth
flavor
and
taste
nice
toffee
malts
and
a
crisp
interesting

flavour
good
for
a
macro
poured
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
inch
of

dissipated
within
2
minutes
smells
absolutely
horrid
slight
sappy
hops
aroma
hardly
any
taste
at
all
slight
bitterness
very
dry
almost
feels
grainy
on
the
tongue
id
drink
it
if
i
was
thirsty
enough
very
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
pretty
decent
for
what
it
is
which
is
extremely
cheap
and
ubiquitous
similar
to
pbr
in
taste
when
options
are
incredibly
limited
stella
4
budweiser
and
keg
bombardier
its
not
too
bad
in
other
situation
i
would
stay
clear
decent
not
great
crisp
clean
but
not
special
overall
crisp
and
refreshing
but
nothing
all
that
extraordinary
here
a
decent
summer
party
brew
not
entirely
flavourless
quite
light
very
drinkable
forgettable
beer
but
quite
satisfying
in
the
warm
sun
overall
a
pretty
ordinary
and
cheaptasting
lager
particularly
for
au50
a
case
no
way
there
are
much
better
lagers
for
less
even
on
hot
barcelona
nights
did
not
care
for
it
im
not
a
fan
of
the
romance
beer
i
mean
french
spanish
italian
this
lager
is
not
a
typical
european
lager
its
something
strange
its
not
bad
and
its
not
good
its
average
beer
not
bad
when
fresh
anyway
this
is
just
your
pale
refreshing
lager
with
more
hops
than
typical
in
southern
europe
not
the
fullest
flavor
but
drinks
smooth
palate

no
real
complaints
nothing

about
either
o
light

crisp
refreshing
lager
that
is
a
nice
cold
drink
but
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
way
of
flavor
will
not
be

anytime

happy
to
have
had

come
to
find
out
this
brew
i
had

on
tap
at
the
9th
door
in
lodo
this
was
the
only
draft
offering
and
id
already
ticked
the
bottles
they
had
bright
yellow
fizzy
looking
lager
aroma
was
nothing
to
write
home
typical
lager
grains
and
a
hint
of
mineral
the
flavor
was
not
half
bad
pretty
standard
fizzy
lager
crisp
refreshing
easy
to
drink
not
sure
why
this
gets
such
low
reviews

othis
beer
is
not
going
to
win
any
awards
from
me
but
i
dont
think
it
compares
poorly
to
other
macro
adjunct
lagers
it
packs
a
bit
more
flavor
than
say
coors
light
or
bud
light
etc
and
it
doesnt
have
the
skunky
rotten
vegetable
flavor
that
i
get
from
big
mexican
lagers
like
corona
of
course
the
real
question
is
why
drink
this
over
a
good
pils
or
other
craft
lager
i
have
consume
this
beer
in
numerous
places
in
the
united
states
spain
morocco
and
el
salvador
fairly
uniformly
tasting
in
all
these
countries
pours
bright
yellow
foamysoapy
head
that
dissipated
rapidly
and
average
carbonation
the
aroma
disappeared
rapidly
after
pouring
it
had
a
watery
taste
with
hops
wheat
rice
and
malty
yeast
mixed
in
there
no
real
edge
and
pretty
light
filling
had
this
on
draft
on
a
warm
evening
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
it
is
not
poor
just
nothing
special
found
it
to
be
easily
drinkable
and
would
happily
have
a
few
overall
one
of
the
better
aals
ive
had
but
thats
not
terribly
inspiring
and
the
tap
selection
would
have
to
be
really
poor
for
me
to
order
this
on
tap
i
had
this
beer
on
my
first
visit
to
barcelona
and
didnt
realize
it
was
their
local
beer
until
i
tried
to
find
it
in
the
states
at
first
taste
it
wasnt
a
winner
but
after
the
second
round
i
realized
this
was
going
to
be
a
favorite
this
beer
is
impossible
to
find
back
home
but
there
is
a
bar
in
venice
beach
near
the
pier
that
has
it
available
and
i
always
make
sure
to
have
a
round
when
i
am
in
town
i
dont
normally
completely
hate
any
aals
but
this
is
one
that
id
love
to
never
have
again
it
smells
of
skunky
hay
and
tastes
the
same
way
the
worst
thing
about
this
beer
though
is
the
aftertaste
i
say
this
in
a
decent
number
of
my
reviews
but
it
has
an
off
bitterness
its
weird
its
unwelcome
its
gross
its
a
metallic
sort
of
bitterness
that
ruins
an
already
pretty
awful
beer
considering
the
67
rating
which
isnt
bad
by
any
means
for
an
aal
ill
have
to
just
guess
that
this
is
a
skunked
bottle
it
sure
tastes
and
smells
like
one
pass
overall
another
poor
euro
lager
that
is
too
sweet
for
its
own
good
there
are
many
good
examples
of
the
style
out
there
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
i
guess
im
not
sure
why
this
one
has
such
low
reviews
i
thought
it
to
be
a
far
superior
beer
to
the
average
euro
lager
it
pours
beautiful
and
elegant
into
a
tulip
with
crystal
clear
golden
hues
and
about
an
inch
of
white
head
that
doesnt
recede
one
bit
nice
lacing
left
behind
and
lazy
carbonation
haphazardly
rising
to
the
surface
the
nose
is
a
little
dusty
some
czech
or
german
pilsener
malts
for
sure
and
just
a
very
common
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
indeed
bready
akin
to
the
pilsener
style
but
it
has
a
lot
less
hops
and
is
instead
balanced
by
a
dryer
malt
complexion
that
finishes
impossibly
clean
it
may
get
a
little
filling
over
time
but
a
few
of
these
to
me
is
a
pretty
solid
session
excellent
carbonation
and
a
sturdy
body
for
its
color
i
have
no
problem
with
this
beer
at
all
a
nice
surprise
from
a
champagne
bar
in
chicago
o
lower
rung
on
the
euro
lager
ladder
too
sweet
to
enjoy
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
accents
of
cream
corn
and
rice
hops
are
there
but
ohsolightly
resigned
to
the
background
the
bud
lite
of
spain
seems
like
it
nothing
more
to
see
here
o
its
whats
in
tapas
bars
so
you
have
little
other
choice
but
honestly
its
not
that
good
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
nice
dry
and
bittersweet
the
sweetness
you
get
from
the
flavor
hangs
on
and
it
just
continues
to
get
dry
as
i
swallow
i
bet
the
aftertaste
hangs
around
a
good
57
minutes
very
impressed
with
this
offering
fun
learning
what
estrella
means
and
neat
knowing
the
man
that
started
this
was
named
damm
consider
this
beer
a
learning
experience
all
around
overall
very
similar
to
american
made
adjunct
lagers
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
a
fruity
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
but
its
drinkable
and
not
offensive
not
terribly
offensive
but
the
fizziness
and
boring
flavor
make
this
a
one
and
done
the
taste
begins
malty
and
has
this
low
to
moderate
bitterness
on
the
backside
but
it
leaves
an
odd
aftertaste
really
nothing
special
here
o
about
to
the
level
of
many
of
the
other
mass
produced
euro
lagers
unfortunately
its
a
bit
more
expensive
would
probably
be
better
in
barcelona
watching
some
poor
bastard
getting
gored
during
the
bull
run
i
feel
for
the
spanish
this
would
be
a
good
beer
if
you
were
stranded
in
the
desert
otherwise
dont
bother
overall
not
a
horrible
beer
i
can
honestly
say
i
enjoyed
it
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
and
i
drank
the
whole
six
pack
not
my
immediate
choice
but
would
have
again
smell
is
a
bit
grassy
taste
is
a
bit
too
watery
for
me
no
crispyness
in
this
beer
it
is
a
good
lager
but
not
more
than
that
no
real
bitterness
or
sweetness
in
this
beer
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
the
beer
is
not
anything
special
but
it
was
sessionable
and
seemed
to
go
down
quite
well
during
the
euro
game
with
my
cornish
pastie
this
beer
goes
well
with
a
euro
soccer
match
dontcha
think
good
postfinal
with
a
sweet
bitterness
refreshing
and
nice
tasty
almost
good
and
better
that
the
other
usual
spanish
offerings
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
retention
is
above
average
for
the
style
and
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
lacing
going
on
little
sweetness
in
the
nose
light
malts
and
grains
not
much
else
nothing
offensive
i
like
that
there
isnt
any
metal
smell
the
taste
is
where
i
think
it
fails
its
a
little
off
balance
too
much
artificial
tasting
sweetness
and
not
enough
hop
profile
if
they
toned
down
the
sweetness
it
would
get
a
better
grade
kinda
reminds
me
of
dog
bit
high
gravity
lager
mouth
feel
is
average
medium
bodied
with
bordering
high
carbonation
this
stuff
is
typical
i
guess
i
know
its
an
american
adjunct
lager
but
i
had
high
hopes
for
some
reason
oh
well
no
reason
to
ever
purchase
this
again
rjt
body
is
very
watery
httpabarwithnoname

very
light
straw

unnatural
white

quickly
smells
of

like
the

with

overall
i
am
personally
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
beer
but
my
older
brother
likes
it
because
he
says
it
is
easy
drinking
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
with
grains
and
malts
the
taste
of
those
same
things
came
through
and
had
very
little
hop
bitterness
at
all
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
brew
isnt
anything
special
i
dont
even
know
if
id
buy
it
again
or
not
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
m
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
thickness
carbonation
is
just
adequate
overall
this
is
a
nice
but
forgettable
lager
o
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
it
is
very
weak
and
bland
and
just
like
a
lot
of
the
other
adjunct
lagers
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
for
an
adjunct
lager
its
decently
enjoyable
and
inoffensive
by
adjunct
standards
its
worth
a
try
dr
a
lime
ester
is
direly
needed
or
something
to
add
to
the
complexity
its
too
expensive
4
quid
in
ibiza
for
the
quality
it
refreshes
but
doesnt
satisfy
o
frankly
disappointing
not
much
flavor
or
nose
to
this
i
will
not
buy
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
skunk
probably
due
to
the
green
bottle
and
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
little
less
skunk
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
lively
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
actually
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bad
beer
that
i
will
not
be
drinking
again

pale

a
large
pure

unfortunately
there
is
also

no

presence
body
is
a
little
heavier
than
i
expected
for
a
lager
good

except
for
the
funky
aroma
the
beer
was
not
as
bad
as
the
rating
it
has
been
getting
i
will
bet
in
a
blind
taste
test
this
beer
would
fair
much
better
oagain
nothing
specialbut
must
say
best
lager
from
spain
i
tried
in
all
this
is
a
typical
mass
produced
european
pilsner
better
than
some
but
nothing
notable
i
can
see
how
this
would
work
in
its
place
of
origin
a
light
refresher
in
a
very
warm
winedrinking
region
i
am
not
one
to
chug
beer
but
this
one
would
go
down
like
water
the
elmblem
of
estrella
damm
is
in
the
shape
of
a
stop
sign
perhaps
its
a
hint
of
what
to
do
should
you
pick
up
a
bottle
o
im
sure
this
would
be
fairly
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
i
wouldnt
pick
up
another
bottle
to
find
out
its
straightup
bland
across
the
board
i
drink
this
often
is
spain
drinking
it
now
in
london
takes
me
back
so
half
a
point
extra
on
overall
for
nostalgia
and
escapism
o
i
guess
i
shouldve
expected
as
much
seeing
how
this
is
as
ubiquitous
in
spain
as
budweiser
in
the
states
easy
to
access
but
other
beer
options
will
likely
taste
better
bitter
and
ascorbic
very
offflavors
of
corn
and
raw
untoasted
malt
hop
profile
is
exaggurated
far
too
much
in
this
beer
leaving
it
taste
like
a
boozy
copper
penny
my
first
spanish
spain
not
mexico
beer
and
this
one
screams
a
bit
too
loud
for
its
own
good
it
just
doesnt
taste
right
and
would
not
make
its
way
in
a
session
under
any
circumstances
its
too
boozy
and
offflavored
below
average
epa
overall
drinkability
good
overall
beer
could
use
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
if
only
the
taste
matched
the
rest
of
the
beer
it
would
be
ace
overall
yeah
its
drinkable
but
not
memorable
the
skunkymetallic
taste
seemed
to
die
down
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
beer
so
that
helped
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
beer
again
wont
be
buying
again
time
to
find
out
if
there
are
any
decent
breweries
in
madrid
easy
drinking
is
the
best
thing
about
it
i
suppose
itd
be
refreshing
on
the
beach
in
the
summer
in
dc
in
february
not
so
much
d
refreshing
and
crisp
but
nothing
incredibly
special
still
i
see
how
this
would
complement
nicely
dishes
like
paella
what
estrella
damm
has
is
fine
balance
in
flavor
a
neat
look
and
much
drinkability
what
it
doesnt
have
what
it
lacks
and
why
i
like
it
is
a
cooked
corn
flavor
thats
unavoidable
or
overbearing
sorry
i
only
bought
a
single
honestly
i
wanted
another
d
typical
bubbly
euro
lager
nothing
special
here
not
awful
but
not
good
overall
this
beer
reminded
me
of
super
bock
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
it
it
tastes
pretty
good
it
isnt
offensive
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
beer
does
not
taste
like
an
american
adjunct
lager
it
tastes
more
like
a
euro
pale
lager
d
this
is
good
but
not
perfect
i
find
it
gets
a
little
cloying
after
several
tastes
but
its
not
an
offensive
tasting
beer
just
a
little
too
much
sticky
sweetness
its
a
beer
that
doesnt
stick
out
but
i
feel
that
its
better
than
the
standard
lagers
available
good
when
really
really
cold
d
not
the
tastest
of
beers
but
one
that
can
lead
to
very
adventrous
nights
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
example
of
the
style
but
so
are
a
lot
of
others
i
only
bought
a
couple
of
bottles
to
test
but
i
would
surely
buy
this
beer
again
right
up
my
alley
d
not
very
flavorful
light
and
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
certainly
not
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
never
had
any
brews
from
spain
this
one
was
being
busted
out
straight
from
the
case
only
a
buck
and
some
change
euro
lager
so
far
appears
a
pale
golden
hue
with
bright
white
head
forming
thick
fine
speckled
lacing
aroma
has
cereal
notes
mild
grainadjuncts
nothing
offensive
clean
slight
citrusy
edge
flavor
has
a
nice
riding
sweetness
alot
of
lemon
notes
actually
in
there
finishes
grassy
with
a
kiss
of
hops
overall
refreshing
great
flagship
mass
produced
lager
from
espana
estrella
equals
star
but
what
is
damm
mouthfeel
is
clean
easy
drinking
sturdy
carbonation
not
over
done
of
course
its
light
bodied
pale
lager
but
its
done
right
here
not
bad
extremely
fresh
example
im
sure
helps
out
a
bit
still
no
fireworks
just
extremely
safe
thirst
quenching
industrial
lager
the
foam
was
white
in
color
bubbly
and
dissapated
quickly
the
color
was
a
crisp
clear
gold
the
smell
was
a
overall
nice
balance
of
hops
and
wheat
with
hints
of
lemon
and
malted
barley
the
taste
was
exactly
the
same
as
the
aroma
a
spanish
version
of
an
american
pilsner
mouthfeel
light
bodied
and
crisp
drinkability
ok
if
you
like
the
basic
american
pilsners
and
lagers
youll
like
this
ok
session
this
is
a
very
sweet
lager
this
is
my
first
estrella
product
as
it
is
generally
hard
to
find
in
the
us
anyways
it
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
light
carbonation
minimal
hoppiness
medium
head
and
leaves
a
slight
tinge
on
the
palette
after
each
swig
this
beer
is
relatively
decent
and
it
somewhat
exceeded
my
expectations
straw
colored
with
a
slight
haze
possibly
due
to
very
small
particulates
short
lived
head
grassy
aroma
with
corn
notes
strong
carbonation
up
front
some
of
the
hops
show
up
in
the
beginning
but
all
quickly
fades
to
nothing
beer
flavored
carbonated
water
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
corn
and
riceriddled
its
right
on
the
label
folks
albeit
in
rather
small
type
beer
this
actually
turns
out
all
right
when
keeping
the
style
in
mind
nothing
to
brush
past
your
mother
for
but
agreeable
enough
if
cold
and
its
sweaty
outside
and
thats
your
prime
brewseeking
directive
at
the
moment
d
this
is
an
easily
sessionable
lager
boasting
the
typical
euro
stle
flavours
its
nothing
special
but
its
by
no
means
terrible
in
fact
i
prefer
this
to
most
other
mass
produced
euro
imports
that
we
get
overall
this
is
an
unbalanced
mediocre
beer
comes
off
as
light
but
hits
you
with
a
strange
aftertaste
would
only
recommend
if
you
want
to
try
a
spanish
beer
closer
to
many
american
beers
that
most
of
the
things
i
have
had
in
europe
so
a
welcome
change
good
with
a
meal
but
i
dont
think
it
would
provide
much
of
an
experience
if
enjoyed
on
its
own
drinkability
a
surprisingly
good
euro
lager
while
i
dont
think
that
this
beer
is
worth
the
high
import
prices
youll
pay
for
it
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
macro
lagers
out
there
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
drinkability
i
would
not
lean
twds
this
beer
again
in
the
future
it
offers
a
limited
amount
of
taste
only
thing
is
its
a
light
and
refreshing
based
beer
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
with
surprisingly
nice
white
head
smells
metallic
and
like
some
grain
but
very
faint
overall
flavour
is
about
as
close
to
nothing
as
beer
could
be
but
a
little
off
tinge
to
it
ok
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
good
as
i
do
not
want
another
one
oh
well
at
least
i
tried
a
beer
from
spain
overallnot
memorable
nothing
wrong
but
not
much
there
that
said
it
went
ok
on
a
hot
day
still
not
much
here
to
recommend
it
over
anything
else
drinkability
is
low
import
price
but
an
adjunct
only
euro
adjunct
i
know
of
why
cant
they
do
a
pale
lager
like
most
euros
do
notes
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
with
a
typical
mass
produced
lager
has
a
lot
of
the
euro
pale
lager
cooked
vegetable
flavors
something
cold
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
maybe
in
barcelona
but
other
than
that
not
really
worth
getting
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
decent
beer
for
a
warm
climate
and
a
class
above
other
major
spanish
beers
available
in
mallorca
however
i
have
the
feeling
if
i
was
drinking
this
in
the
cold
and
dampness
of
england
i
wouldnt
particularly
enjoy
it
pale
gold
and
crystal
clear
with
a
lot
of
fizzy
carbonation
an
inch
and
a
half
of
white
foam
covered
the
beer
fine
in
texture
at
first
but
more
rocky
as
the
high
carbonation
supported
the
cap
decent
head
retention
a
bit
of
clumpy
lacing
the
foam
started
looking
a
bit
strange
after
a
while
looking
really
creamy
on
top
and
rocky
underneath
which
could
be
due
to
the
stabilizer
listed
in
the
ingredients
it
just
didnt
look
right
sweet
grain
and
corn
aroma
a
bit
fruity
mild
grassy
hops
the
flavour
was
pretty
basic
some
sugary
sweetness
cereal
grains
with
some
cooked
veggies
and
fruity
hops
in
the
background
slightly
mineral
in
the
finish
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
quite
dry
fairly
mediocre
and
not
something
ill
go
back
to
level
flavors
either
in
the
nose
or
mouth
there
are
few
flavors
really
appreciable
the
body
is
too
unpleasant
and
finish
a
little
dry
and
bitter
has
a
strange
and
bitter
little
interesting
for
the
fans
certainly
due
to
the
label
glutenless
gives
him
a
taste
forgettable
overall
i
had
this
multiple
times
while
in
barcelona
but
the
tap
version
at
this
particular
place
was
head
and
shoulders
above
the
rest
maybe
it
was
the
tap
lines
but
its
certainly
a
different
beast
fresh
worth
a
shot
if
youre
near
the
source
i
hade
a
5
liter
can
brought
back
from
spain
it
poured
a
clear
gold
in
my
20oz
glass
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
th
aroma
has
its
good
point
and
back
theres
a
sharp
unpleasant
boiled
vegetable
note
but
also
a
nice
bread
and
brown
sugar
character
the
flavor
is
a
little
better
with
bread
crust
and
a
fruity
lager
notes
backed
by
a
lightly
spicy
hop
finish
this
beer
actually
tastes
fairly
decent
but
there
is
an
odd
vodka
note
in
background
still
on
a
sweaty
summer
day
id
enjoy
a
pint
taste
is
very
sweet
and
very
carbonated
did
not
see
that
one
coming
very
nearly
like
sugarwater
cloying
almost
which
is
strange
for
such
a
light
bodied
beer
i
want
something
more
crisp
for
a
hot
day
which
i
am
sure
barcelona
sees
plenty
of
where
is
the
bitterness
on
the
finish
what
minute
amount
does
make
it
there
is
far
too
little
and
too
late
i
can
dig
on
some
aals
but
this
is
one
of
the
worst
ones
i
have
had
in
a
looong
time
and
at
import
prices
f
that
gimmie
a
pbr
over
this
anyday
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
totally
forgettable
i
have
to
wonder
why
the
government
beer
monopoly
wastes
precious
limited
cooler
space
on
mundane
foreign
imports
like
this
when
its
hard
to
get
the
decent
micro
beers
from
other
provinces
imported
theres
nothing
special
about
this
beer
but
sometimes
context
matters
i
can
remember
quaffing
one
or
two
of
these
in
the
plaza
at
granada
or
toledo
at
midnight
in
the
hot
spanish
summer
refreshing
doesnt
get
much
better
than
that
d
easily
drinkable
but
hop
crispness
is
not
strong
enough
and
just
dies
a
bit
in
the
finish
fine
for
a
hot
climate
but
id
prefer
it
to
lean
more
to
the
hop
crispness
than
the
malt
tried
this
beer
as
a
sampler
and
it
was
a
pretty
decent
example
of
a
european
lager
could
see
this
being
a
nice
enjoyable
summer
time
brew
good
amount
of
sweetness
yet
nicely
check
with
a
little
bit
hop
bitterness
like
most
euro
lagers
highly
drinkable
and
not
extremely
complex
non
the
less
alot
better
beer
then
many
of
the
other
example
out
there
on
the
market
today
of
lagers
worth
a
try
its
good
not
life
changing
but
a
respectable
lager
this
beer
was
crisp
and
had
some
hop
presence
and
it
was
probably
the
best
spanish
beer
that
we
had
on
the
trip
second
beer
of
the
night
at
toro
in
the
south
end
poured
into
a
tall
drink
glass
slightly
orange
tinted
colored
body
smell
reminded
me
of
most
euro
lagers
with
hints
of
corn
flavor
was
decent
there
was
a
bit
more
malt
in
this
beer
which
added
to
its
flavor
and
mouthfeel
again
its
not
a
great
beer
but
it
pairs
well
with
tapas
and
its
always
more
fun
to
match
spanish
beer
with
spanish
food
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
with
not
much
of
a
white
head
with
almost
no
lacing
very
grainy
aroma
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
a
slightly
crisp
beer
with
a
clean
taste
and
very
slight
bitter
finish
a
good
beer
to
suck
down
on
a
hot
day
but
not
much
memorable
about
it
the
taste
is
not
terribly
appealing
cooked
corn
and
vegetables
alcohol
and
carbonation
slight
bitterness
thin
watery
mouthfeel
drinkability
degrades
significantly
as
the
temperature
of
the
beer
rises
can
from
lcbo
another
frequently
marketed
pale
lager
i
could
not
open
he
can
with
the
little
tab
a
can
opener
worked
but
had
to
suffer
through
the
cheesy
aroma
first
pale
body
with
foamy
off
white
head
below
average
mouthfeel
there
was
a
little
malt
in
the
taste
a
tad
of
bitterness
it
was
not
the
worst
yellow
fizzy
beer
i
have
had
but
not
too
drinkable
12oz
brown
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
brilliant
pale
straw
with
a
thin
head
fairly
grainy
aroma
maybe
a
bit
of
corn
light
bodied
with
some
malt
sweetness
bit
of
a
noble
hop
bite
clean
flavor
profile
would
be
very
drinkable
in
the
summer
time
above
average
light
lager
the
taste
is
pretty
typical
beer
flavors
though
it
does
start
to
taste
a
bit
like
apple
juice
it
is
better
than
others
i
wont
mention
you
know
who
they
are
not
worth
the
price
at
all
for
a
craft
drinker
the
taste
is
almost
more
powerful
than
it
needs
to
be
which
cuts
down
on
the
refreshment
wont
buy
it
again
not
really
glad
i
tried
it
oh
well
good
drinkabilit
unspectacular
but
good
tasty
lager
pretty
average
stuff
more
bold
than
most
larges
of
this
style
but
that
isnt
necessarily
better
i
expected
more
from
the
kingdom
of
spain
i
love
spanish
food
and
wine
but
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
fail
well
not
such
a
great
beer
pale
almost
greenish
color
with
a
thin
head
and
little
to
no
lace
smell
is
of
alcohol
and
bacteria
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
taste
is
almost
a
sweet
barleywine
type
taste
with
notes
of
alcohol
not
very
drinkable
i
may
try
this
one
again
some
other
time
im
not
terribly
excited
to
finish
the
6pack
its
kinda
skunky
awful
awful
awful
yellow
in
color
terrible
smell
thin
overcarbonated
piss
d
i
would
definitely
order
this
in
a
restaurant
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
at
the
store
given
a
reasonable
selection
the
very
drinkable
pilsner
lager
from
spain
is
by
far
easily
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
in
the
world
its
humble
in
appearance
and
smell
but
it
has
a
quite
common
ground
taste
which
goes
hand
in
hand
with
its
smoothness
definitely
a
bars
high
end
beer
with
happy
hour
price
tag
reviewed
on

1900
overall
this
is
a
pretty
standard
adjunct
lager
its
nothing
really
special
and
i
probably
will
never
have
it
again
especially
considering
how
expensive
it
is
in
the
us
like
9
a
sixer
in
nc
decent
alternative
to
other
adjunct
lagers
though
taste
is
rather
similar
light
but
somewhat
firm
basic
grain
hint
of
veg
light
wisp
of
sharp
grassy
bitterness
at
finish
and
lingering
with
warm
fusel
alcohol
my
wife
popinted
out
that
it
tastes
like
kerosene
in
the
end
it
is
rather
like
a
weak
basic
malt
liquor
d
if
anything
this
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
but
only
probably
because
its
so
light
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
some
hints
of
corn
taste
is
mostly
of
malts
and
corn
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
overall
an
ok
beer
that
could
easily
pass
as
one
of
the
bmcs
easy
drinker
and
would
go
down
quickly
on
a
hot
day
if
you
want
something
light
and
without
a
bunch
of
flavor
you
could
do
worse
rotation
avail
here
not
much
flavor
so
one
is
enough
unless
at
a
spanish
restaurant
and
this
is
best
choice
no
tap
unless
best
choice
drinkability
beer
was
light
easy
drinking
i
could
through
back
a
couple
with
friend
i
drank
this
for
the
first
time
in
barcelona
sitting
under
a
hot
sun
and
i
remember
enjoying
it
more
there
on
the
beach
d
certainly
one
of
the
best
adjunct
lagers
out
there
i
was
certainly
suprised
by
this
effort
and
would
defintely
drink
it
again
if
i
wanted
a
euro
style
lager
t
it
has
something
of
a
malt
taste
but
the
aftertaste
is
very
sour
it
progessively
gets
more
horrible
terrible
beer
d
if
i
were
in
a
bar
in
barcelona
then
i
would
have
4
or
5
if
i
were
at
the
supermarket
i
would
only
pick
one
up
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
could
put
many
of
these
away
in
one
sitting
however
will
holdout
for
something
will
more
body
and
flavor
d
better
than
most
american
macros
but
thats
not
saying
much
but
for
the
style
i
kinda
like
it
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
nothing
special
but
not
offputting
aroma
is
richly
malty
and
has
a
strong
fruity
component
to
it
flavor
is
mainly
malty
and
has
traces
of
apple
and
cherry
and
is
rather
sweet
texture
is
very
smooth
and
somewhat
thick
fizzy
and
lively
not
great
but
worthy
of
a
try
overall
an
ideal
beer
for
the
thirsty
traveler
easy
to
drink
to
say
the
least
da
a
step
up
from
mahou
but
not
more
than
that
im
still
on
the
lookout
for
a
good
adjunct
lager
this
is
obviously
nothing
special
but
i
would
put
this
just
slightly
above
the
typical
adjunct
because
it
seems
that
at
least
someone
understands
the
concept
of
beer
being
made
with
hops
d
not
a
bad
beer
would
have
again
better
and
heavier
than
other
light
spanish
beers
ive
tried
can
from
the
lcbo
pours
sparkling
gold
a
frothy
white
cap
nose
is
quite
grainy
of
vegetables
mostly
asparagus
wet
paper
this
is
fucking
rank
tastes
not
as
bad
as
the
nose
but
still
pretty
stale
creamed
corn
a
full
platter
of
wet
paper
this
tastes
quite
stale
the
finish
is
quick
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
but
this
is
really
not
at
all
good
pours
clear
gold
with
a
smallish
head
but
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
pretty
typical
very
faint
light
malt
and
some
grassy
herbal
hops
taste
is
malty
with
some
toastiness
herbal
hops
and
a
pleasant
bitterness
in
the
finish
actually
pretty
balanced
and
good
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
easily
drinkable
pretty
good
for
the
style
exactly
what
youd
expect
of
an
american
lager
crisp
some
malt
adjunct
flavors
present
low
bitterness
perfect
for
kicking
back
about
a
dozen
the
only
thing
that
surprised
me
about
this
beer
is
that
it
had
a
greater
floral
hop
presence
than
most
american
lagers
i
picked
some
up
in
the
smell
and
a
bit
in
the
taste
as
well
i
wouldnt
try
seeking
this
one
out
but
if
you
come
across
it
or
happen
to
be
in
barcelona
why
not
notes
very
drinkable
and
seemed
to
be
a
step
up
from
the
usual
lager
notes
this
is
my
first
beer
from
spain
and
it
is
on
par
with
any
american
light
lager
style
beer
that
i
have
had
this
is
nice
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
complex
for
spain
bottle
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
lager
with
a
large
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
lightly
sweet
malt
withs
some
notes
of
crisp
hops
taste
is
somewhat
light
with
light
malt
with
no
distinctive
notes
of
adjunct
and
some
light
dry
hops
presence
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
not
sure
if
i
was
more
thirsty
then
usual
but
this
did
tasted
not
too
bad
d
definitely
a
warmweather
summery
brew
flavours
are
boring
but
inoffensive
and
accomplishes
the
task
of
refreshing
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
soapy
head
smelled
of
grain
husks
and
some
corn
not
horrible
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
very
dry
finish
pale
malt
dominates
and
theres
is
little
to
no
bitterness
a
decent
clean
tasting
lager
but
not
one
to
pay
for
at
import
prices
drinkability
another
basic
straightup
average
lager
but
from
barcelona
spain
and
0
8
less
ounces
natch
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
but
its
inoffensive
enough
to
drink
casually
saved
only
by
its
utter
inoffensiveness
hows
that
for
being
damned
with
faint
praise
worth
drinking
in
the
above
contexts
only
drinkability
it
worked
as
was
one
of
the
beer
adjunct
lagers
i
have
had
in
a
while
it
quenched
the
thai
mission
accomplished
only
recently
have
i
seen
this
available
in
these
parts
in
a
red
can
yellow
liquid
id
like
to
say
yellow
gold
but
thats
a
bit
of
a
stretch
clear
and
transparent
my
rather
hurried
pour
produced
a
tall
foamwhite
head
with
soap
suds
lace
that
slid
down
the
glass
without
much
sticking
lightbodied
in
the
mouth
thin
and
lacking
in
taste
this
mass
produced
lager
had
almost
no
smell
perhaps
a
corn
syrup
presence
that
was
totally
uninspiring
taste
was
also
rather
flat
lemony
hint
of
bitter
or
did
i
imagine
that
aftertaste
a
touch
sour
it
was
difficult
to
find
much
to
say
about
this
beer
nothing
about
it
stood
out
except
a
rather
tasteless
earthiness
that
was
annoying
if
ever
in
spain
ill
look
for
this
on
tap
surely
it
must
be
better
than
this
my
first
spain
beer
i
wonder
what
else
they
have
to
offer
spain
both
at
the
national
and
regional
levels
is
full
of
rich
distinctive
cuisines
and
gastronomic
traditions
so
why
dont
they
brew
good
beer
to
go
with
them
sure
spaniards
could
point
out
climate
history
and
the
cultural
and
economic
importance
of
wine
but
id
point
out
to
them
italys
emerging
micro
scene
and
show
that
creative
artisan
beers
can
succeed
if
not
flourish
in
such
a
culture
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
drinkability
while
within
a
style
that
doesnt
lend
itself
to
grand
complexity
its
still
relatively
rich
compared
to
most
other
beers
of
this
style
for
that
alone
i
think
it
deserves
a
decent
score
it
is
also
very
cheap
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
generous
white
head
nose
is
disappointingly
a
little
vegetal
with
a
suggestion
of
pears
and
an
herbal
quality
palate
is
somewhat
creamy
crisp
and
a
pleasantly
mild
malt
focus
light
overall
but
that
vegetal
component
comes
through
and
is
somewhat
putrid
it
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
tiny
flash
in
the
pan
head
that
managed
to
leave
a
few
streaks
of
lace
behind
on
the
glass
corn
and
vapid
sweet
malt
mix
with
a
bit
of
hop
earthiness
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
watery
and
uneventful
some
malt
and
crackers
mix
with
a
subdued
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
the
finish
is
simple
and
on
the
sweet
side
this
beer
has
a
nice
deep
color
based
on
that
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
heavy
it
is
surprisingly
light
with
a
very
sweet
taste
to
it
it
almost
tastes
like
something
you
might
marinate
a
steak
in
i
bet
it
would
be
good
for
that
but
as
a
beer
i
would
have
to
say
it
did
not
do
it
for
me
average
or
even
less
than
so
probably
not
a
bad
thing
on
a
hot
afternoon
but
id
never
buy
it
again
d
meh
given
a
hot
day
and
not
a
lot
of
choice
id
be
happy
to
see
this
in
my
hand
no
overly
impressed
at
all
d
it
wasnt
bad
i
could
see
pairing
this
up
with
some
tapas
when
you
might
want
to
drink
more
than
1
or
2
it
just
doesnt
do
anything
to
set
itself
apart
from
many
of
the
other
import
lagers
on
the
market
for
the
price
there
are
a
good
many
german
or
czech
beers
that
id
pick
up
before
going
back
to
this
one
d
its
drinkable
probably
over
a
six
pack
for
me
very
clean
and
crisp
but
the
body
is
too
light
for
me
overall
an
okay
lager
nothing
special
drinking
simple
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
flippant
lager
american
adjunct
lager
not
bad
at
all
clean
and
crisp
with
some
fair
flavors
for
a
macro
lager
the
freshness
and
green
qualities
that
the
hops
and
even
malt
bill
provide
makes
it
a
pleasurable
drink
not
necessarily
one
i
would
seek
out
but
definitely
worth
a
shot
especially
if
exploring
import
lagers
this
is
definitely
one
to
consider
d
easy
to
drink
easier
without
so
much
carbonation
though
again
nothing
offensive
which
can
be
tough
damn
a
spanish
beer
out
of
the
bottle
this
one
was
a
perfectly
clear
pale
straw
gold
the
cap
was
white
and
very
short
lived
but
there
was
some
lacing
the
aromas
was
classic
macro
lager
dry
grains
a
yeasty
twang
and
some
lager
malt
the
flavors
were
parallel
but
a
little
better
a
variation
on
the
tradition
macro
stuff
it
had
more
of
a
tart
crisp
flavors
than
budweiser
et
al
and
it
was
much
more
clean
too
in
this
regard
it
was
very
bright
summery
and
sessionable
if
you
like
the
style
this
was
aided
by
the
light
carbonation
and
light
body
however
it
was
by
no
means
complex
and
not
really
worth
finding
unless
you
want
to
try
a
little
latin
flavor
barecelona
is
not
known
for
its
beer
but
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
was
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
crisp
refreshing
tatse
with
little
negative
aftertaste
i
drank
it
on
my
honeymmon
alot
there
and
when
i
came
back
to
the
states
it
was
remarkably
similar
to
what
i
had
most
euro
beers
taste
different
to
me
here
mouthfeel
is
of
good
carbonation
hop
spice
not
bad
overall
and
easy
to
drink
i
wont
place
this
in
my
top
tier
but
certainly
wont
turn
it
down
if
offered
by
anyone
very
disappointing
im
glad
i
only
purchased
one
bottle
because
with
the
metallic
flavor
the
rest
would
be
undrinkable
d
its
a
macro
but
i
fear
that
there
are
better
examples
of
the
macro
style
out
there
i
was
expecting
more
i
guess
nothing
just
sat
up
and
me
go
damm
ah
well
i
am
not
saying
i
will
never
drink
it
again
but
i
am
not
saying
it
is
the
most
worthy
of
beers
or
macros
pours
an
extremely
pale
yellow
color
which
could
be
described
as
urine
crystal
clear
with
a
decent
chunky
head
after
a
very
sturdy
pour
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
which
is
the
only
impressive
thing
about
this
brew
aroma
of
skunk
it
comes
in
a
brown
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
0309
so
i
doubt
age
or
green
bottle
issues
have
anything
to
do
with
this
funkyskunk
flavor
dominates
vegetal
slight
hop
bitterness
theres
some
crisp
malt
presence
but
nothing
exciting
in
the
least
just
not
very
good
its
like
heineken
only
worse
flavor
becomes
less
skunky
as
it
warms
crisp
and
dry
average
carbonation
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
this
one
again
for
any
reason
i
was
only
intrigued
by
this
single
bottle
because
id
never
had
a
spanish
beer
before
ill
pass
on
this
stuff
next
time
it
doesnt
sit
well
and
my
mouth
tastes
of
weeds
and
ashfault
now
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
light
feel
with
some
carbonation
tingling
an
overall
boring
corn
beer
that
wouldnt
be
too
awful
consumed
at
the
bar
via
ice
cold
bottle
and
an
alcohol
loosened
mind
d
this
isnt
a
particularly
well
made
beer
that
being
said
is
there
a
decent
version
of
the
american
macro
lager
out
there
probably
not
d
drinkable
i
was
mildly
surprised
by
this
beer
and
would
not
be
opposed
to
having
again
felt
kind
of
like
a
pretty
standard
major
lager
that
slightly
dry
taste
and
lingering
afterfeel
in
the
mouth
are
not
much
to
my
liking
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
maybe
give
it
a
try
but
otherwise
not
really
worth
the
investment
may
as
well
drink
a
miller
etc
d
this
is
an
okay
lager
not
offensive
in
any
way
and
easy
drinking
perhaps
if
it
came
from
a
bottle
rather
than
a
can
it
might
have
been
better
drinkability
oh
just
fine
worth
a
shot
a
golden
yellow
has
a
good
white
head
but
not
as
much
carobnation
than
i
expect
in
a
lager
the
flavor
is
week
and
lacking
a
little
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
was
the
only
enjoyable
thing
about
this
beer
it
was
a
little
sour
for
my
taste
my
mom
liked
it
though
altho
she
likes
coors
light
the
best
so
that
should
give
you
some
idea
d
i
had
one
and
thats
all
i
needed
its
drinkable
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
2
50
a
can
might
be
ok
as
a
novelty
in
the
summer
bbq
cooler
nothing
great
though
clean
fresh
uncomplicated
with
some
dry
notes
just
what
i
want
from
a
macrobrewed
lager
ill
give
it
a
slight
bump
for
drinkablity
if
only
for
it
costing
the
same
as
a
coke
in
europe
yet
another
bud
from
another
land
pretty
much
the
budweiser
of
spain
and
about
as
flavorful
not
worth
more
than
one
try
mf
d
thin
and
medium
carbonation
dont
you
dare
let
this
one
get

330

head
that
leaves
a
good

deep

its
always

smells
of
hops
some

and

citrus
standard
taste
of
nothing
just
a
bit
citrus
and
grain
maybe
some
sweetness
but
with
a
bitter
finish
refreshing
yes
but
nothing
more
to
say
in
its

d
ok
with
some
spicier
foods
like
mexican
or
curry

that
is
about
it

the

and
some

light

not
drinkable
my
first
from
this
brewery
noticeable
adjunct
taste
slight
hop
zing
bland
and
uninspired
but
refreshing
when
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
macro
lagers
mouthfeel
is
typical
just
a
bit
better
than
very
thin
drink
is
high
pretty
refreshing
but
with
more
flavor
than
your
typical
macro
lager
yields
a
pretty
reasonable
brew
for
a
hot
day
or
celebration
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
i
dont
know
that
i
would
necessarily
seek
it
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
and
its
definately
a
brew
that
you
can
put
a
few
down
in
one
session
when
i
pulled
estrella
damm
from
the
fridge
today
i
thought
it
was
my
first
beer
from
spain
it
turns
out
that
the
forgettable
estrella
galicia
earned
that
honor
back
in
2006
this
one
is
no
more
memorable
and
isnt
recommended
unless
youre
looking
to
add
to
the
countries
number
on
your
profile
page
while
certainly
not
mindblowing
im
not
sure
how
many
macro
lagers
would
be
in
the
first
place
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
out
of
spain
drinkability
beer
looks
good
smells
not
so
good
tastes
not
so
good
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
low
in
flavor
and
alcohol
just
not
sure
why
i
would
want
another
a
six
pack
is
very
expensive
maybe
if
i
am
in
barcelona
not
likely
so
i
would
say
it
is
likely
i
will
not
be
having
another
smooth
enough
to
chug
if
thats
what
youre
into
nothng
interesting
though
could
be
worse
mediocreish
in
style
from
a
one
litter
bottle
this
brew
pours
a
light
yellow
and
transparent
color
the
head
is
initially
tall
and
puffy
and
produces
some
nice
lace
the
foam
doesnt
last
long
though
the
aroma
is
all
grain
and
grass
its
got
some
husk
and
moderately
musty
hop
qualities
as
well
very
dry
and
effervescent
the
beer
when
combined
with
its
lightness
takes
on
a
tonicwater
characteristic
almost
zero
sweetness
there
is
a
hint
of
malt
somewhere
there
for
a
fleeting
instant
in
the
midtaste
the
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
its
not
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
its
moderately
drinkable
a
clear
miss
although
id
say
it
is
better
than
most
of
the
american
macros
overall
a
bland
almost
tasteless
macro
lager
its
very
refreshing
and
dry
which
im
sure
would
pair
well
with
many
onedimensional
foods
hot
dogs
chili
cheese
fries
and
even
chicken
noodle
soup
not
bad
just
unmemorable
even
though
it
did
a
good
job
of
cutting
through
the
cheese
and
spice
of
the
nachos
its
not
worth
seeking
out
however
if
youre
out
having
tapas
and
selections
are
limited
this
will
suffice
d
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
food
but
otherwise
a
very
average
euro
macro
lager
looks
a
lot
better
than
it
tastes
quite
drinkable
however
and
i
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
quite
easily
id
try
it
again
in
spain
but
i
wont
be
hunting
for
it
around
my
neck
of
the
woods
hoped
for
a
clean
euro
lager
but
instead
got
a
flavourless
corona
style
lager
not
much
to
say
but
avoid
since
there
are
lots
of
decent
canned
pils
on
the
shelves
that
have
some
personality
put
a
lime
in
it
to
make
it
a
beach
beer
maybe
it
tastes
better
in
spain
drinkability
this
one
just
doesnt
fit
the
bill
for
any
flavor
not
worth
a
try
in
my
book
very
drinkable
smooth
and
dry
great
warm
weather
beer
with
taste
a
nice
refreshing
beer
that
is
a
notch
above
the
beers
made
in
the
usa
a
typical
and
utterly
forgettable
macro
brew
not
worth
the
import
price
just
buy
pabst
if
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
want
easy
enough
to
drink
for
a
summer
cooler
or
just
general
purposes
nothing
special
but
nothing
objectionable
either
beautiful
golden
color
with
some
white
head
that
is
very
fleeting
and
leaves
just
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
smell
and
taste
were
pretty
typical
macro
lager
but
avoids
most
of
the
potential
disasters
that
cheaper
macro
lagers
tend
to
have
skunkiness
oversweetness
etc
this
beer
goes
down
easily
but
the
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
price
and
the
fact
that
i
dont
really
want
another
i
am
not
even
sure
that
i
had
one
in
the
first
place
it
left
absolutely
no
lasting
impression
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
buy
something
cheaper
if
you
want
to
enjoy
a
good
beer
pick
up
a
better
beer
for
the
same
price
no
reason
to
even
try
this
one
really
the
overall
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
what
keeps
it
from
being
a
disaster
but
it
cant
quite
pull
it
from
mediocrity
there
is
low
bitterness
no
skunk
flavor
and
no
awkward
vegetablecorn
oil
taste
its
just
a
smooth
drinking
lager
not
unlike
the
typical
macro
pale
lagers
you
find
all
over
europe
not
the
worst
not
the
best
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
creamy
white
head
with
big
bubbles
on
top
fading
away
to
an
even
thinner
layer
pretty
quickly
it
does
leave
its
mark
on
the
glass
al
the
way
down
though
smells
faintly
of
noble
hops
and
a
little
yeasty
tastes
very
clean
and
balanced
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
the
bitterness
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
finish
clean
theres
a
little
bit
of
lager
malt
flavor
there
but
not
much
no

that
i
could

on

with
some

for

its
a

little
flavor
but
did
well
with
food
this
beer
is
hard
to
get
where
i
live
and
its
not
that
good
i
know
its
very
popular
in
the
northern
states
but
here
in
central
mexico
it
has
a
bad
rep
ok
with
some
tacos
needs
salt
and
lime
fantastic
mouthfeel
and
the
flavor
seems
to
downplay
the
adjuncts
in
favor
of
very
soft
malts
the
aroma
suffers
as
with
many
of
these
beers
but
this
is
a
solid
choice
with
mexican
fare
ill
stick
to
staying
thirsty
my
friends
better
than
pacifico
a
very
light
beer
overall
ah
nothing
all
that
spectacular
here
it
is
pretty

really

its

typical
of
the
style
like
dozens

nothing

just
what
a
beer
needs
to
do
definitely
will
buy
this
again
overall
a
pleasant
drinkable
light
lager
that
pairs
well
with
spicy
mexican
food
typical
mexican
adjunct
served
best
with
a
lime
for
hot
sunny
days
pours
a
goldenyellow
in

very
thin

some
very

spotty

is
seen
the

is
really
nothing
special
at
all
some
yeast
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
some
grains
with
a
hint
of
corn
a
little
on
the
watereddown
side
and
slightly
stale
even
though
no
date
is
found
on
the
bottle
and
bought
it
just
in
the
past
2
weeks
average
to
above
average
carbonation
really
nothing
special
about
this
brew
beyond
that
cb
really
has
two
practical
uses
we
have
used
it
for
cooking
namely
in
borracho
beans
and
slowcooked
beef
beyond
that
i
suppose
you
can
use
cb
to
put
out
a
small
fire
id
choose
a
carta
blanca
over
a
us
macro
lager
but
thats
not
saying
much
this
is
a
pretty
lousy
beer
another
one
of
the
mexican
beers
thats
okay
from
the
bottle
but
flattens
right
out
when
you
pour
it
this
one
has
a
caramel
color
to
it
virtually
no
carbonation
and
a
lot
less
refreshment
and
relief
from
spicy
food
that
i
anticipated
the
lime
wedge
it
is
generally
served
with
actually
helps
a
bit
giving
some
acidity
and
making
it
pop
but
i
hate
to
rely
on
fruit
to
bail
out
a
poor
brew
the
malts
taste
watered
down
and
overly
sweet
and
there
are
no
hops
at
all
to
speak
of
i
still
prefer
it
to
corona
as
i
do
with
mostly
all
beers
but
this
is
more
of
a
lateral
move
than
a
vertical
one
fairly
pedestrian
but
short
of
awful
not
a
bad
mexican
lager
choice
atmosphere
is
okay
pale
washedout
coloration
pretty
nice
foamy
head
and
fair
lacing
not
much
in
the
nose
light
grain
and
a
little
yeasty
very
light
body
white
bread
and
a
little
yeast
not
much
else
overall
this
is
a
not
so
good
quaff
o
while
this
beer
didnt
have
much
in
the
aromas
or
flavors
of
adjuncts
it
is
really
lacking
when
it
comes
to
hops
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
but
close
to
it
probably
wouldnt
kill
you
if
you
were
dying
of
thirst
but
thats
the
only
other
time
id
want
one
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
smell
is
very
mild
and
watery
with
some
malt
grain
and
cornlike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
very
watery
and
pretty
flavorless
quality
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
and
another
one
of
the
gross
mass
produced
mexican
beers
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
pale
golden
with
a
tall
white
head
and
plenty
of
streaming
bubbles
the
head
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
has
the
aroma
of
lightly
toasted
malts
and
crackers
there
are
some
mild
hops
in
the
smell
as
well
the
beer
has
a
mild
bready
flavor
with
some
bitter
hops
in
the
background
it
tastes
like
a
standard
pale
lager
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
good
beer
that
stands
above
most
mexican
lagers
easy
drink
not
much
substance
but
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
filmy
white
coating
along
the
surface
aromas
of
butter
toasted
cereal
and
floral
highlights
flavors
are
watered
down
with
a
subtle
buttered
toast
backbone
and
a
sharp
slightly
sour
overtone
musty
slightly
roasted
aftertaste
with
a
watery
limp
finish
not
good
this
beer
is
pretty
average
and
boring
but
theres
a
little
salt
taste
that
doesnt
belong
in
any
drink
it
would
be
more
than
easy
to
do
better
with
another
beer
this
is
a
crystal
clear
yellow
gold
color
musty
light
beer
aroma
smells
stale
even
when
its
fresh
virtually
no
flavor
keep
it
cold
so
it
stays
crisp
and
drinkable
anything
above
32
degrees
and
the
flavor
such
as
it
is
drops
off
completely
o
nothing
special
here
it
was
good
enough
while
eating
mexican
food
but
nothing
i
would
have
again
overall
for
the
price
point
this
is
not
any
worse
than
any
other
mexican
beer
it
may
be
better
id
say
this
is
better
than
tecate
at
the
very
least
given
that
beer
is
mostly
water
i
tend
to
want
to
drink
beers
made
as
far
north
as
possible
but
i
have
some
sentimental
memories
of
drinking
carta
blanca
on
draft
in
tijuana
at
the
bol
corona
to
be
exact
so
i
picked
up
a
32
oz
at
my
local
because
well
i
dont
know
why
exactly
tastes
like
a
generic
if
somewhat
watery
american
beer
but
with
that
mexican
dryness
that
i
guess
comes
from
the
water
down
there
salud
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
its
not
outstanding
the
taste
does
have
a
little
something
different
to
it
i
cantplace
the
taste
but
whatever
it
is
it
quickly
fades
i
wish
they
would
have
taken
whatever
it
was
they
were
doing
a
little
farther
over
all
though
this
isnt
bad
you
can
drink
it
without
a
problem
for
a
change
of
pace
from
a
regular
light
beer
this
will
do
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
no
off
flavors
great
for
the
style
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
nothing
to
brag
about
hear
but
also
not
necessarily
offensive
in
any
way
as
with
most
mexican
beers
it
goes
well
with
the
food
of
a
somewhat
similar
origin
o
a
drinkable
beer
simple
and
easy
to
drink
poured
a
very
light
transparent
gold
with
a
head
that
contained
enormous
bubbles
the
kind
that
fade
to
nothing
very
quickly
the
smell
cheapo
malt
the
taste
carbonation
with
some
super
cheapo
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
i
poured
it
into
a
beer
stein
and
im
putting
the
rest
of
the
32
in
the
freezer
as
it
tastes
like
it
will
be
better
if
its
colder
there
is
very
little
taste
in
this
beer
its
gotta
be
like
the
busch
of
mexico
it
has
a
different
flavour
than
busch
though
its
a
bit
more
bitter
itd
probably
be
easy
to
drink
enormous
quantities
of
this
so
its
got
that
going
for
it
theres
nothing
else
good
to
say
about
it
its
incredibly
watery
but
not
really
refreshing
in
the
way
that
club
sodas
not
very
refreshing
since
thats
basically
what
this
tastes
like
o
add
lime
and
it
gets
better
3
5
d
there
are
certainly
worse
beers
out
there
but
this
one
is
pretty
bad
and
i
could
not
recommend
this
one
had
this
at
a
mexican
restaurant
this
evening
played
nicely
with
the
enchiladas
and
was
a
pleasant
smooth
beer
while
not
something
id
go
to
for
everything
its
a
great
example
of
a
mexican
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
goes
well
with
lots
of
things
on
a
hot
summer
day
right
when
you
open
the
bottle
of
this
beer
you
catch
the
aroma
that
is
distinctive
o
carta
blanca
it
smells
sweet
like
a
lemon
has
been
dropped
in
it
carta
blanca
is
one
of
my
favorites
mexican
cervezas
have
always
been
partial
to
me
it
goes
down
smooth
and
tastes
light
and
dark
at
the
same
time
it
leaves
no
bitter
after
taste
its
is
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
them
but
i
use
the
word
couple
delicately
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
rjt
for
super
hot
weather
only
d
there
are
better
mexican
beers
out
there
best
with
mexican
food
this
beer
drinks
almost
like
a
carbonated
water
overrall
i
have
had
worse
and
on
a
hot
day
it
was
not
that
bad
at
al
dont
think
i
will
be
rushing
out
to
buy
it
though
d
there
are
better
mexican
beers
out
there
best
with
mexican
food
picked
this
pup
up
at
my
local
ethnic
supermarket
with
a
decent
manufacture
date
pours
light
gold
with
a
shortlived
carbonic
head
the
nose
is
soft
light
grains
even
slightly
malty
and
way
understated
i
was
ready
to
reach
in
the
fridge
for
a
lime
but
resisted
the
temptation
its
very
light
in
taste
and
texture
it
makes
corona
appear
muscular
by
comparison
c
b
quenches
well
in
this
lousy
torridly
hot
and
humid
weather
here
in
se
ny
these
days
so
fire
up
the
lawn
mower
bbq
or
sit
outside
with
a
copy
of
car
driver
but
dont
forget
the
lime
carta
blanca
is
a
clean
lightly
flavored
beer
from
mexico
it
goes
down
easy
there
is
bit
of
adjunct
sweetness
through
the
center
but
not
much
and
overall
not
much
flavor
at
all
which
is
what
makes
it
drinkable
the
color
was
as
yellow
a
beer
as
i
have
seen
but
the
cap
of
foam
was
white
and
pillowy
mmmm
mexican
beer
should
only
be
compared
to
mexican
beer
when
a
countrys
water
has
the
reputation
that
mexicos
has
one
shouldnt
expect
the
beer
thats
produced
there
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
other
beers
from
around
the
world
that
being
said
carta
blanca
is
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
it
is
very
smooth
with
a
pleasant
after
taste
it
goes
great
with
mexican
food
but
i
acually
prefer
other
mexican
beers
for
that
purpose
this
is
a
good
beer
for
drinking
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
or
out
on
the
porch
on
a
hot
day
you
can
drink
a
six
pack
while
grilling
and
your
tongue
will
still
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
between
the
cabrito
and
the
menudo
i
like
it
i
really
love
this
mexican
beer
im
my
opinion
it
has
a
nice
rich
taste
if
your
in
the
mood
for
some
smooth
mexican
beer
give
this
one
a
try
this
goes
great
with
almost
any
kind
off
food
or
just
to
sit
back
and
pound
some
down
with
friends
next
time
your
in
the
store
and
see
a
6
pack
pick
one
up
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
corn
but
is
very
faint
the
taste
is
much
the
same
there
is
something
there
but
not
much
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
annoyingly
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
disappointing
adjunct
lager
i
have
come
to
expect
more
from
this
style
taste
is
typical
for
the
style
heavy
and
noticeable
amount
of
corn
malty
sweetness
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
noticeable
in
this
beer
and
gives
it
a
slight
malt
liquor
fell
to
it
but
the
body
is
not
thick
or
creamy
at
all
not
a
bad
brew
and
is
really
easy
to
throw
back
i
am
sure
i
will
find
myself
face
to
face
with
another
quart
of
white
label
at
some
point
in
the
future
for
an
adjunct
lager
this
is
actually
pretty
good
it
pours
a
yellow
that
is
a
few
shades
darker
than
most
adjuncts
a
bit
more
bready
and
grapelike
than
most
adjunct
lagers
and
also
the
mouthfeel
though
light
is
not
as
fizzy
its
a
good
beer
to
wash
down
mexican
food
with
and
good
for
a
summer
day
but
i
prefer
bohemia
a
beer
thats
worth
trying
if
youre
at
a
mexican
restaurant
not
too
bitter
fairly
smooth
this
beer
reminded
me
of
what
i
would
expect
from
the
most
popular
domestics
except
that
it
was
served
with
a
lime
i
will
definitely
give
it
another
try
but
im
not
dying
for
another
bottle
of
it
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
this
beer
was
extremely
drinkable
but
extremely
flavorless
as
well
a
bud
light
will
have
more
flavor
than
this
beer
i
just
wont
be
buying
this
again
and
i
dont
recommend
it
at
all
i
do
recommend
you
go
for
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
like
modelo
especial
tecate
or
my
favorite
of
the
style
so
far
budweiser
as
far
as
bland
mexican
macros
are
concerned
this
isnt
too
bad
could
do
worse
easy
enough
to
drink
a
few
while
washing
down
some
tacos
without
adding
or
detracting
much
though
for
a
mexican
macro
to
do
the
same
i
would
go
with
bohemia
very
bready
for
a
pilsner
i
usually
like
a
bit
more
hop
presence
i
didnt
notice
the
skunk
that
others
have
reported
but
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
new
bottle
that
hasnt
had
much
light
exposure
reviewing
pilsners
are
tough
because
i
usually
find
them
so
boring
this
is
no
exception
the
aroma
is
light
hops
and
a
lot
of
skunk
the
taste
is
basically
the
same
the
mouthfeel
is
less
than
water
is
that
possible
drinkable
is
ok
but
whats
the
point
with
the
abv
i
have
a
problem
reviewing
beers
of
this
nature
there
arent
really
palatable
examples
in
this
category
i
rated
this
beer
based
on
a
mixture
of
bias
and
trueness
to
style
will
i
ever
drink
this
beer
again
probably
not
is
this
a
good
example
of
its
style
its
above
average
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
this
at
my
local
liquor
store
because
i
needed
something
for
a
family
members
mexicanthemed
birthday
dinner
and
it
was
cheap
as
im
sure
you
can
infer
from
my
review
this
beer
doesnt
really
seem
very
mexican
the
excessive
graininess
far
outweighs
any
citrus
character
so
this
beer
tastes
much
like
the
listed
style
american
adjunct
lager
i
dont
suggest
going
out
of
your
way
to
try
this
beer
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
cheap
i
suppose
you
could
do
worse
another
local
aal
with
a
better
price
will
serve
just
as
well
absolutely
nothing
special
here
appearance
is
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
fair
head
that
dissapates
quickly
having
very
light
lace
smell
of
very
light
sweet
grains
and
hops
taste
is
lightly
sweet
grainy
corn
cereal
with
light
hops
mouthfeel
does
have
good
body
and
carbonation
definitely
better
than
what
i
originally
expected
d
overall
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
a
solid
effort
out
of
the
mexican
industrial
lager
category
tmd
a
modlight
body
kinda
syrupy
for
a
lager
i
wanted
a
bit
more
crispness
from
it
not
a
horrible
mouthfeel
but
a
little
below
par
for
its
style
for
me
the
taste
is
mostly
predictable
a
litle
sweetness
from
grain
tortilla
rice
nothing
too
off
but
just
below
par
its
a
little
watery
and
not
very
flavorful
drink
ice
ice
cold
for
maximum
injoyment
better
yet
pick
something
else
mfd
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
thirst
quencher
or
paired
up
with
mexican
cusine
a
lot
better
than
i
had
expected
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
gold
color
with
a
12
inch
head
mild
corn
aroma
taste
is
rather
bland
not
much
going
on
here
feels
watery
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
good
especially
in
heat
overall
this
is
a
fairly
average
beer
finish
dry
and
with
a
little
bitter
aftertaste
d
not
bad
if
you
are
in
a
pinch
and
want
to
try
something
different
probably
against
my
better
judgment
ive
been
trying
all
of
the
beers
that
are
readily
available
at
the
mexican
restaurants
in
denver
after
carta
i
have
two
more
to
go
before
i
return
to
a
steady
diet
of
bohemia
and
negra
modelo
with
my
enchiladas
d
probably
the
worst
beer
from
ccm
the
more
you
drink
it
tastes
worst
i
had
one
of
these
last
night
at
a
good
nofrills
mexican
joint
with
the
purpose
of
reviewing
ive
had
a
few
carta
blancas
over
the
years
i
gotta
say
its
not
bad
a
good
working
mans
lager
without
expecting
much
it
actually
tastes
alright
nothing
particularly
bad
here
just
nothing
great
it
was
fine
with
the
authentic
type
tacos
i
ordered
id
have
another
this
one
poured
a
pale
golden
with
little
head
seemingly
low
carbonation
it
smelled
of
corny
malt
and
actually
kind
of
sourish
the
taste
was
much
better
than
the
smellvery
corny
malt
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
the
body
was
on
the
upper
end
of
low
which
isnt
saying
much
but
not
far
off
what
i
imagine
a
brew
from
south
of
the
border
to
be
overall
this
is
an
average
mexican
brew
it
was
pretty
far
off
my
favorite
pacifico
but
at
least
it
was
drinkable
d
had
this
while
eating
mexican
food
so
it
wasnt
horrible
but
other
wise
id
say
stay
away
from
this
beer
smells
very
corny
pours
to
a
bright
yellow
with
a
lacy
head
that
quickly
recedes
but
leaves
lacing
taste
is
very
watery
with
some
sweet
corn
and
hardly
any
hopping
but
what
there
is
more
floral
than
bitter
finish
is
watery
and
thin
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
carbonation
seems
low
i
guess
its
better
than
drinking
the
water
if
in
mexico
to
avoid
moctezumas
revenge
i
think
its
also
part
of
his
revenge
to
have
a
beer
like
this
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malts
quickly
subdued
by
real
hops
carbonation
is
just
right
slightly
dry
mildly
bitter
finish
very
pleasant
easy
drinker
good
session
beer
due
to
mild
flavors
and
low
4
5
abv
i
would
probably
keep
some
of
this
around
but
the
price
runs
8
or
9
per
sixer
ive
never
seen
a
short
case
for
sale
in
my
area
only
sixers
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
lager
here
compared
to
most
others
in
the
genre
i
like
it
im
not
sure
why
i
continue
to
drink
this
beer
there
are
better
alternatives
available
for
the
price
and
quality
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
its
readily
available
here
in
town
and
occasionally
i
crave
cheap
mexican
beer
go
figure
on
the
whole
though
its
just
not
a
great
brew
this
beer
was
not
an
incredibly
great
beer
but
overall
nothing
i
would
kick
out
of
bed
it
is
not
as
fullfilling
compared
to
most
of
the
other
mexican
beers
i
have
had
this
beer
would
go
okay
with
a
bland
food
maybe
just
a
flour
tortila
oh
well
i
would
recomend
this
for
anything
but
mexican
food
one
of
the
weekest
mexican
beers
i
have
had
a
not
to
complex
macro
that
hits
the
spot
when
having
some
mexican
food
other
than
that
i
would
avoid
this
d
fairly
easy
enough
to
put
down
sweet
nonoffensive
wont
blow
you
away
but
wont
turn
you
off
and
a
good
macroalternative
or
entry
level
beer
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
sampled
out
of
mexico
well
it
was
1130
when
i
got
home
so
its
all
about
gettin
the
job
done
with
my
beer
selection
tonight
and
i
have
to
say
this
did
the
trick
good
night
drinkability
if
you
dont
expect
more
than
it
offers
it
does
the
job
with
grace
avoid
this
one
pours
a
fairly
pale
gold
with
a
couple
fingers
worth
of
soft
white
foam
that
retains
nicely
before
leaving
some
abundant
lacing
as
it
falls
smells
a
lot
like
ritz
crackerswith
some
grassy
notes
as
well
this
lager
is
crisp
with
a
grainy
backbone
that
turns
earthy
and
dry
nearly
perfect
on
the
carbonationthe
body
could
use
some
more
gonads
this
is
pretty
good
for
a
mexilagerno
complaints
d
about
the
same
as
all
mexican
macro
styles
just
a
good
average
beer
that
is
going
to
get
the
job
done
d
this
isnt
bad
for
a
mexican
beer
it
does
just
fine
while
throwing
down
so
tacos
thin
and
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
excellent
for
washing
down
spicy
texmex
chow
forgive
me
but
i
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
easily
my
favorite
mexican
macro
lager
this
stuff
doesnt
have
the
metallic
notes
of
sol
and
doesnt
have
the
skunkfunk
of
corona
crisp
grainy
and
well
carbonated
its
easy
to
drink
these
quickly
in
the
sun
or
help
to
chase
down
a
spicy
salsa
i
also
rarely
find
this
stuff
unless
im
in
south
florida
where
they
have
it
at
one
of
my
favorite
mexican
restaurants
i
say
skip
the
lime
and
as
with
most
macro
lagers
never
get
it
in
a
can
the
taste
is
much
better
thankfully
and
its
light
with
a
persistent
grain
and
a
light
watery
applecider
element
the
finish
is
soft
with
an
aftertaste
of
grain
compared
to
pacifico
it
has
more
flavour
but
it
is
more
rough
compared
to
corona
its
better
all
round
except
maybe
the
smell
a
light
yellow
color
lager
with
a
flimsy
white
head
and
a
bit
of
big
bubbled
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
crispy
wheat
and
some
citrus
it
tastes
somewhat
more
mellow
than
the
aroma
suggests
perhaps
a
bit
of
malt
noted
pretty
fizzy
stuff
very
thin
with
a
watery
wheat
base
a
little
sweetness
not
complex
but
reasonably
crisp
and
very
drinkable
its
really
not
that
bad
for
what
it
is
it
has
a
mild
yet
pleasant
flavor
decent
mouthfeel
inoffensive
aroma
and
pretty
good
finish
for
a
cheap
beer
please
pass
me
the
hops
ive
got
to
day
i
just
really
really
like
this
beer
i
could
drink
it
over
and
over
again
and
seems
to
go
perfectly
with
crackers
and
appetizers
its
really
nothing
exceptional
and
its
really
not
goint
to
blow
your
mind
away
but
its
kind
of
like
a
really
delicious
cracker
turned
into
a
liquid
carbonated
drinkable
form
i
like
it
because
it
definitely
doesnt
have
the
sweetness
present
in
most
beers
but
more
of
a
dry
taste
for
the
savory
palate
its
definitely
smooth
but
without
exceptional
flavor
though
its
hard
to
say
why
i
prefer
carta
blanca
so
much
except
that
its
just
so
unoffensive
so
unintense
yet
distinct
and
smooth
its
great
if
you
dont
want
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
beer
but
want
it
to
complement
everything
and
anything
savory
that
is
drinkablity
easy
to
pound
no
real
flavor
though
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
most
people
think
about
when
they
hear
the
word
beer
a
pale
yellow
body
fizzy
soda
head
slightly
sweet
note
of
corn
and
watery
it
was
a
chore
to
put
down
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
when
it
warmed
up
it
became
unpalatable
even
a
slice
of
lemon
couldnt
save
it
very
nondescript
and
unenjoyable
better
than
average
for
the
type
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
has
little
to
no
originality
and
has
zero
aftertaste
to
it
very
weak
in
the
flavor
department
another
from
a
mix
received
for
xmas
drinkability
is
good
there
is
not
much
taste
here
so
most
any
drinker
can
tolerate
it
if
for
only
a
couple
sips
i
really
think
that
this
type
of
beer
has
enough
characteristics
to
separate
it
from
an
american
macro
lager
im
thinking
cerveza
is
a
style
that
should
be
adopted
for
this
type
of
lager
drinkability
it
is
a
light
easy
to
drink
beer
and
it
goes
alright
with
the
local
food
carta
blanca
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
sweet
corny
aroma
there
is
a
mild
hop
flavor
that
hits
me
instantly
the
malt
is
noticeable
as
is
a
sweet
corn
flavor
not
bad
really
for
what
it
is
one
of
the
better
mexican
macro
lagers
fairly
drinkable
brew
but
kind
of
heavy
for
its
beer
type
spritzy
yet
buttery
mouthfeel
with
the
sweet
flavor
staying
with
you
from
start
to
finish
i
didnt
notice
a
trace
of
alcoholic
presence
whatsoever
making
this
an
easy
drinker
i
only
bought
it
because
i
never
saw
it
before
with
the
caguama
label
on
it
and
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
it
was
surprisingly
good
for
what
it
is
carta
blanca
pours
a
clear
golden
body
beneath
an
averagesized
head
of
white
foam
that
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
pretty
nice
walls
of
very
thin
lace
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
brightly
grassy
and
slightly
spicy
even
a
touch
citrusy
over
notes
of
husky
cereallike
grain
the
flavor
is
even
more
grainy
and
strawlike
with
the
hops
falling
towards
the
back
its
a
good
balance
though
except
that
the
bitterness
level
seems
a
touch
low
some
dimethyl
sulfide
appears
and
perhaps
some
dialkyl
sulfides
as
well
giving
it
a
cooked
corncooked
vegetable
character
thats
distracting
but
not
offputting
its
rather
dull
in
the
finish
with
a
smear
of
husky
and
mealy
grain
followed
by
a
minor
showing
of
hoppy
spiciness
an
average
beer
at
best
cervecería
cuauhtémoc
moctezuma
should
be
able
to
do
much
better
unless
of
course
theyre
keeping
it
this
way
because
the
consumer
likes
it
and
expects
it
d
drinkable
enough
for
a
mexican
summer
lager
but
its
not
a
memorable
brew
by
any
means
went
well
with
mexican
food
but
their
are
better
beers
at
most
mexican
restaurants
d
a
little
tastier
than
most
beers
ive
had
in
the
style
goes
down
easy
not
filling
at
all
i
have
to
say
that
it
was
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
although
i
wasnt
expecting
much
i
highly
recommend
this
version
32
oz
if
you
can
get
it
a
not
very
impressive
beer
on
the
other
hand
at
least
it
isnt
horrible
aroma
is
beery
but
weak
and
the
color
is
typical
with
a
little
bit
of
head
that
doesnt
persist
flavor
is
fair
to
middlin
malty
without
any
bitterness
it
is
not
much
by
itself
so
drink
it
with
dinner
or
at
a
party
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
clear
lightgolden
color
with
a
thin
soapy
head
not
much
going
on
with
the
smell
a
very
slight
citrus
note
mostly
grainy
malt
the
taste
is
also
of
grainy
malt
slight
hoppiness
that
balances
the
beer
well
smooth
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
is
well
carbonated
this
is
an
average
beer
on
all
accounts
a
lightcreamy
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
tang
a
good
refreshing
beers
not
bad
for
a
marco
beats
bmc
a
decent
beer
in
a
mexician
restraunt
went
down
very
smooth
and
easy
was
really
good
with
the
spicy
food
drinks
slow
due
to
the
thiness
lack
of
flavors
still
better
than
many
of
its
cousins
north
of
the
rio
grande
basically
a
lower
than
average
mexican
lager
theres
better
things
out
there
that
id
much
rather
have
drinkability
needs
to
be
ice
cold
to
be
enjoyable
this
may
be
the
worst
beer
to
drink
in
the
dead
of
winter
in
new
york
besides
that
this
beer
is
not
terrible
for
what
it
is
its
fizzy
and
yellow
has
no
smell
taste
grainy
but
is
easy
to
drink
and
washes
town
tostadas
nicely
much
better
than
corona
almost
as
good
as
tecate
not
great
for
30
degree
night
but
pretty
good
for
warm
beachside
day
add
a
lime
for
flavor

did
i
get

ive
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
while
so
again
thanks
chris
not
horrible
but
in
the
same
zip
code
this
is
more
mediocre
mexican
macrononsense
from
the
folks
at
cualhtemoc
moctezuma
in
monterrey
ok
at
the
beach
or
a
summer
day
of
mowing
or
with
a
fiery
taco
platter
thats
about
it
in
all
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
poured
a
pale
golden
yellow
topped
by
a
modest
white
head
aroma
is
a
little
grainy
not
much
going
on
maybe
a
hint
of
sweet
corn
flavor
is
clean
lightly
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
nobletype
hops
actually
much
better
than
expected
mouthfeel
is
not
really
thin
but
far
from
solid
or
thick
good
for
the
style
drinkability
is
ok
typically
id
have
a
second
beer
but
didnt
want
a
second
of
this
good
beer
for
mexican
or
latin
cuisine
but
thats
about
it
beer
poured
a
pale
caramel
color
with
a
decent
head
in
the
glass
the
smell
had
a
strong
grain
componentrice
taste
was
a
little
better
than
the
typical
mega
beer
and
it
had
a
clean
finish
it
had
decent
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
and
went
very
well
with
the
awesome
chicken
mole
we
had
at
el
norteno
in
albuquerque
pours
with
a
pale
yellow
head
with
a
small
white
foamy
head
which
leave
no
lacing
smells
like
most
macros
slightly
sweet
has
a
clean
crisp
taste
and
light
mouthfeel
fairly
drinkable
although
i
think
two
and
half
would
be
my
max
for
the
day
i
might
buy
it
again
but
thats
doubtful
bottom
line
i
can
heartily
recommend
the
restaurant
but
not
the
beer
overall
a
substandard
cerveza
stick
with
modelo
or
dos
equis
note
its
much
better
with
a
lime
which
is
not
a
good
thing
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
straw
with
a
half
finger
head
quickly
fizzles
out
leaving
just
a
touch
of
spotty
lacing
clean
aroma
mabye
some
weak
adjuncts
pilsener
malt
and
mild
rice
flavor
with
a
spicy
saazlike
hop
bite
in
the
aftertaste
the
offflavor
is
subdued
and
the
overall
taste
has
excellent
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
niether
dry
nor
slick
and
very
smooth
finishes
clean
and
very
drinkable
outstanding
compliment
for
mexican
cuisine
or
a
humid
summer
day
continuing
in
the
cincodemayo
festivities
i
owe
it
to
our
neighbors
to
the
south
to
drink
a
few
beers
from
the
homeland
to
those
neighbors
your
beer
sucks
no
all
kidding
aside
its
similar
to
our
u
s
lagers
just
as
sweet
with
adjucnts
just
as
vegetol
just
as
grainy
just
as
void
of
flavor
as
our
macro
lagers
are
straw
yes
smells
like
cream
corn
yes
tastes
grainy
yes
watery
mouthfeel
yes
finishes
biteey
yes
so
what
does
it
have
thats
good
there
is
a
light
sweetness
that
is
balanced
with
a
grain
husk
hop
bittering
good
for
washing
down
those
burritos
light
bodied
with
a
light
creaminess
its
not
bad
i
actually
enjoyed
it
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
rather
inexpensive

a
quart
considering
its
shipped
from
mexico
to
new
york
and
then
lands
here
in
so
cal
definitely
worth
a
try
cheers
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
mild
flavor
i
would
have
this
beer
again
but
probably
only
while
dining
on
mexican
cuisine
behold
the
mesiterbrau
of
mexico
if
nothing
else
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
i
was
stuck
in
some
mexican
hotel
during
malaria
season
i
might
consider
doing
so
otherwise
i
would
avoid
light
clear
gold

nice
looking
head
fades
steadily
lots
of
visible
carbonation
cooked
grain
smell
slightly
sour
pretty
weak
taste
is
miserably
plain
to
the
point
of
it
being
bad
tasting
lightly
grainy
this
beer
has
ben
done
many
times
before
another
boring
bland
yet
offensive
mexican
beer
pass
says
on
the
sixpack
the
first
mexican
beer
since
1890
im
not
quite
sure
what
the
hell
that
means
maybe
something
was
lost
in
the
translation
very
light
yellow
color
with
no
head
light
grassy
herbal
aroma
and
a
clean
taste
with
no
aftertaste
whatsoever
i
can
imagine
this
being
a
cult
summer
classic
sort
of
like
corona
because
it
is
so
watery
and
drinkable
however
it
lacks
any
unique
characteristics
and
doesnt
even
come
close
to
being
able
to
merit
the
7
99
price
tag
i
saw
the
sixers
listed
at
thank
god
i
swiped
a
free
sample
i
drink
this
one
when
i
go
to
stadium
to
support
my
favorite
football
team
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
with
massive
white
puffy
head
very
attractive
lacing
smell
is
virtually
nonexistant
but
at
least
not
offensive
taste
is
also
minimal
with
also
a
slight
sweetness
noted
finish
is
cold
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
good
spacer
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
slight
head
that
disappears
quickly
smell
is
uninteresting
at
bestindiscernible
grains
with
a
bit
of
spice
the
taste
is
even
less
noteworthy
beyond
some
grains
there
was
nothing
therenot
even
the
bit
of
quenching
flavor
that
makes
many
mexican
beers
nice
pairings
with
mexican
food
in
this
case
the
beer
added
nothing
at
all
to
the
meal
the
relative
highpoint
was
the
mouthfeel
which
was
fuller
than
the
nose
and
taste
would
lead
one
to
expect
i
kept
thinking
at
least
this
is
pretty
drinkable
but
the
fact
is
it
wasnt
bittebieroct

maybe
with
the
mexican
mixtures
of
lemon
with
hints
of
hops
and
barley
finished
rather
clean
with
notes
of
mild
bitterness
and

blanca
reminds
me
in
appearance
and
taste
of
an
american
light
beer
but
alcohol
taste
is
noticible
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
but
short
lived
head
the
aroma
was
mild
and
grainy
the
taste
was
grainy
and
slightly
sweet
the
carbonation
was
alright
and
there
was
some
hop
bite
it
had
a
slightly
dry
finish
it
wasnt
a
skunky
beer
however
ave
enjoyable
but
weak
when
eating
mexican
cuisine
out
and
about
i
like
to
order
this
onepours
a
light
straw
color

nothing
special
just
mexican
budweiser
bad
beer
and
slam
a
lime
in
it
to
make
it
go
down
o
easy
drinking
lager
thats
much
better
than
corona
and
its
just
as
available
no
lime
necessary
tastes
just
like
water
to
me
not
as
good
as
amber
version
overall
poor
flavors
too
watery
and
a
little
stale
when
you
go
to
a
mexican
restaurant
and
the
waiter
tells
you
that
they
have
dos
equis
be
sure
its
ambar
amber
or
better
drink
something
else
pours
what
you
kind
of
expect
an
adjunct
lager
to
pour
with
this
being
said
it
definitely
leads
the
pack
in
this
category
personally
not
a
fan
of
beers
that
requires
something
like
a
lime
to
be
drinkable
this
is
a
decent
lager
i
cant
say
anything
bad
about
it
if
youre
biased
towards
to
mexican
beer
such
as
corona
make
sure
to
leave
that
aside
this
beer
has
a
bad
rep
but
it
sits
well
and
is
good
for
having
on
the
deck
in
the
summer
that
being
said
there
are
many
more
better
choices
when
compared
to
the
most
common
mexican
beers
and
even
the
macro
american
stuff
this
is
consistent
and
a
cold
can
is
always
welcomed
its
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
overall
this
would
barely
pass
as
a
lawnmower
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
even
for
that
i
would
never
willingly
consume
this
beer
again
we
seriously
need
to
rethink
nafta
fairly
typical
pale
lager
thats
drinkable
more
substantial
than
others
in
its
class
they
should
just
make
the
amber
and
call
it
a
day
light
and
crisp
similar
to
corona
but
i
think
a
bit
more
flavor
always
best
with
a
wedge
of
lime
and
a
pinch
of
salt
easy
to
find
this
or
modelo
especially
are
my
go
to
mexican
beer
not
bad
while
sitting
poolocean
side
in
mexico
its
a
really
good
beer
decent
but
can
end
up
tasting
like
blood
andor
rust
half
the
time
great
bbq
beer
during
the
summer
drink
only
the
green
bottles
i
dont
hear
too
many
positive
reviews
about
mexican
beers
but
i
like
them
i
cant
imagine
eating
a
nice
mexican
dinner
with
a
heineken
dos
equis
is
the
perfect
brew
for
that
occasion
its
light
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
that
south
o
the
border
maltiness
a
twist
of
lime
and
you
are
set
enjoy
smooth
drinkable
decent
flavor
its
not
good
but
it
is
definitely
not
natty
not
bad
has
some
bite
to
it
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
significant
but
fleeting
head
that
retreats
to
minimal
lacing
smell
and
taste
have
some
malt
but
adjuncts
are
clearly
present
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
finish
almost
nonexistent
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
dos
equis
amber
is
a
much
better
choice
if
both
are
available

c
enjoy
horrible
im
no
beer
geek
but
this
is
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
no
hops
no
flavor
at
all
watery
bread
and
piss
yuck
this
beer
sucks
horrible
lingering
after
taste
tried
it
twice
thinking
maybe
i
had
a
bad
batch
the
first
time
but
nope
its
just
nasty
all
the
time
you
want
a
cheap
beer
to
party
with
tecate
its
cheaper
then
this
shit
and
way
better
you
know
as
far
as
mainstream
lagers
go
i
like
it
it
has
a
pleasant
almost
sweet
flavor
and
i
can
drink
it
all
night
if
i
want
good
for
parties
and
large
gatherings
with
a
lot
of
noncraft
beer
people
3
75
for
a
quart
local
so
the
price
was
nice
o
pretty
much
par
for
the
style
a
much
better
alternative
to
corona
one
of
my
favorite
go
to
beers
when
i
feel
like
drinking
something
familiar
and
refreshing
best
during
the
summer
i
personally
like
dos
equis
a
lot
because
i
find
it
super
refreshing
theres
not
a
ton
of
depth
to
it
but
it
tastes
light
and
cool
on
a
warm
summer
day
i
enjoy
the
lightness
and
the
tang
on
the
other
hand
i
also
love
a
good
dark
beer
and
this
is
about
as
far
as
youre
going
to
get
from
that
bleah
overall
decent
amber
lager
but
nothing
i
need
to
really
seek
out
id
only
have
again
if
i
was
handed
this
i
first
tried
dos
equis
in
cozumel
mexico
i
found
that
it
pairs
quite
well
as
a
chaser
to
a
sweeter
liquor
my
personal
favorite
pairing
is
disarrono
on
the
rocks
with
a
dos
equis
to
clear
the
sweetness
off
the
palate
in
between
golden
hued
with
good
clarity
minimal
head
barely
covers
part
of
the
top
of
this
beer
aroma
of
light
grain
and
corn
is
prevalent
mouth
is
thin
and
watery
i
get
pretty
much
entirely
corn
with
the
flavor
and
a
bit
of
saaz
hops
another
hot
weather
brew
that
is
highly
quaffable
ook
beer
nothing
impressive
about
flavor
or
experience
a
relatively
clean
drinking
beer
but
very
lacking
in
flavor
it
was
ok
tried
it
for
the
first
time
it
was
a
hoppy
for
my
taste
i
like
stout
they
have
a
good
taste
texture
and
look
it
wasnt
bad
that
looking
and
it
was
not
that
hoppy
but
just
a
little
to
hoppy
for
me
everyone
likes
different
things
if
you
would
like
to
try
it
its
ok
not
to
hoppy
which
is
a
good
thing
for
me
poured
from
a
12oz
can
into
a
12oz
glass
pours
translucent
straw
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
nothing
smells
of
sweet
grain
but
very
weakly
tastes
of
sweet
grain
not
much
else
but
a
fuller
flavor
than
most
adjuncts
beer
is
light
bodied
nice
carbonation
crisp
finish
overall
an
average
beer
i
had
high
expectations
from
this
beer
possibly
because
of
the
good
marketing
this
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
ever
smelled
and
tasted
i
tried
it
warm
and
ice
cold
both
had
a
greasy
scent
almost
like
left
over
grease
smell
i
am
not
the
pickiest
beer
enthusiast
either
i
just
love
beer
but
the
awfulness
brought
me
here
to
rate
overall
decent
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
poured
from
the
green
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
pub
fare
after
i
tried
the
only
craft
offering
in
the
house
rogue
dead
guy
ale
if
you
care
first
off
yes
it
is
better
than
corona
or
sol
id
propose
that
said
feat
is
not
difficult
to
achieve
secondly
while
there
is
indeed
some
german
lager
character
present
one
has
to
dig
deep
to
appreciate
this
feature
a
light
honey
hue
with
tons
of
white
bubbles
smells
vaguely
sour
and
metallic
old
wet
grain
and
a
skunky
vegetal
note
that
for
some
reason
reminds
me
of
cilantro
perhaps
i
am
smelling
some
noble
hop
or
noble
hop
extract
tastes
like
fizzy
alcoholic
water
with
some
faint
lemon
rind
and
green
apple
character
actually
the
apple
isnt
all
that
faint
the
skunk
spray
effect
coupled
with
the
fruitiness
presumably
acetaldehyde
and
a
decent
dose
of
cooked
corn
yield
this
soapy
pungent
herbal
note
that
again
makes
me
think
cilantro
and
by
and
large
this
beer
remains
something
id
drink
in
mexico
over
tecate
or
corona
but
has
previous
little
else
to
recommend
the
dos
equis
amber
is
better
without
being
spectacular
for
whats
its
worth
theres
a
whole
lot
of
mexican
american
adjunct
lagers
out
there
and
this
one
actually
professes
to
be
the
work
of
a
german
brewmaster
it
holds
little
german
influence
but
ranks
better
than
most
mexican
beers
as
i
was
not
compelled
to
throw
a
lime
in
it
for
the
most
part
the
palate
is
met
with
a
barley
grain
but
hints
of
rice
and
a
corn
sugar
sweetness
take
hold
the
feel
is
very
crisp
sugary
sweet
and
a
tad
thicker
than
others
from
south
of
the
border
this
is
better
than
some
worst
than
others
and
right
around
ok
i
personally
did
not
care
for
this
beer
it
tasted
very
watery
i
cannot
give
a
fair
analysis
of
the
smell
appearance
or
mouthfeel
because
i
dont
remember
it
all
that
well
as
it
has
been
a
while
since
ive
had
it
but
the
taste
didnt
do
anything
for
me
yes
its
pretty
mediocre
it
has
that
sweet
corn
smell
and
taste
that
is
expected
but
its
really
not
that
bad
at
all
i
would
absolutely
enjoy
this
during
or
after
a
hard
working
day
on
a
farm
in
the
hot
sun
however
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
this
up
dos
equis
lager
especial
25
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
it
does
not
have
that
characteristic
and
ever
intensifying
aal
sweetness
that
lasts
much
too
long
into
the
after
taste
remarkably
fresh
light
thin
balanced
and
delicious
i
liked
this
beer
more
than
i
ever
thought
i
would
a
pretty
good
american
adjust
lager
despite
the
green
bottle
theres
low
skunkiness
which
is
nice
overall
mediocre
but
drinkable
lawnmower
beer
but
this
isnt
anything
i
would
purchase
on
my
own
again
i
dont
agree
that
this
beer
should
be
classified
as
aal
i
think
the
ba
needs
a
new
category
such
as
caribbean
lager
very
good
tastng
beer
in
my
opinion
way
better
choice
than
coors
lite
or
bud
light
smooth
and
good
taste
way
too
many
people
on
here
complain
a
lot
but
i
think
its
a
great
beer
i
may
not
be
a
huge
beer
person
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
what
i
recommend
i
say
leave
the
xx
across
the
rio
grande
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
it
just
doesnt
have
much
of
a
taste
it
has
a
smooth
start
which
is
interrupted
with
an
unpleasant
acid
carbonation
a
decent
beer
on
a
scorning
hot
day
for
those
of
you
who
dont
always
drink
beer
but
when
you
do
i
e
if
you
are
a
non
beer
drinker
this
is
a
good
choice
for
you
o
i
recall
dos
equis
amber
being
an
unexciting
but
acceptable
beer
though
ive
got
to
admit
i
havent
had
one
in
years
however
this
special
lager
just
isnt
very
good
very
little
character
to
speak
of
and
what
is
there
isnt
anything
to
brag
about
im
going
to
go
squeeze
a
lime
in
it
and
hopefully
that
will
make
it
taste
like
something
better
than
what
it
is
i
used
to
love
this
stuff
when
i
was
a
kid
in
my
early
20s
before
i
started
experimenting
with
craft
beer
i
havent
had
one
in
over
10
years
and
saw
a
16oz
can
on
sale
at
the
gas
station
and
picked
it
up
after
spoiling
myself
with
a
decade
of
sampling
some
of
the
finest
beers
in
the
world
today
i
didnt
expect
to
care
for
it
nowadays
and
i
was
right
this
is
just
your
typical
lousy
runofthemill
american
adjunct
piss
yellow
almost
no
head
and
an
even
flatter
flavor
this
is
even
worse
than
corona
its
basically
rolling
rock
with
a
mexican
themed
label
i
let
my
desire
for
a
little
nostalgia
rob
me
of
1
49
it
wont
be
happening
again
overall
probably
my
favorite
mexican
beer
that
i
know
of
i
have
not
had
many
i
think
the
green
bottle
ruined
the
taste
a
bit
light
enough
to
drink
all
night
not
my
favorite
light
beer
but
i
wont
turn
one
down
that
said
this
is
a
pretty
good
adjunct
lager
on
the
basis
of
taste
since
i
can
finish
the
bottle
no
problem
some
of
the
local
adjunct
beers
here
are
just
junk
do
not
know
why
this
beer
has
sun
low
ratings
i
dont
think
people
realize
it
os
not
suppose
to
be
a
flavor
monster
i
love
this
beer
when
it
is
freeking
got
outside
and
i
go
in
to
one
of
my
favorite
restaurants
and
get
a
24oz
glass
and
it
is
freezing
cold
it
goes
down
super
smooth
light
hoppyness
great
beer
if
im
looking
for
a
light
yet
complex
smooth
flavor
overall
moderately
refreshing
but
not
good
enough
to
warrant
drinking
a
ton
of
it
that
said
this
is
by
far
not
the
worst
adjunct
lager
ive
had
its
a
decent
beer
theres
no
off
flavor
its
just
bland
its
very
refreshing
and
high
drinkable
goplden
crystal
beer
with
white
foam
that
vanishes
very
fasttiny
bubbles
no
lace
aroma
is
no
t
present
its
taste
is
very
poorsome
kind
of
nothing
a
very
watery
beer
as
many
other
industrial
massive
beers
in
market
nowadays
very
light
bodied
something
to
avoid
for
sure
overall
really
after
all
of
the
fantastic
advertising
and
cost
of
this
beer
i
would
have
expected
it
to
be
a
bit
better
i
really
could
not
tell
it
apart
from
a
regular
macro
brew
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
ever
between
the
light
skunkiness
and
the
subtle
flavor
profile
dos
equis
special
lager
was
barely
drinkable
it
is
definitely
a
far
cry
from
their
amber
lager
they
may
have
a
good
marketing
campaign
but
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
does
not
drink
this
beer
and
he
wasnt
dumb
enough
to
try
it
overall
the
best
you
can
say
is
its
easy
drinking
and
relatively
inoffensive
but
thats
only
because
it
doesnt
take
like
much
of
anything
i
will
pass
on
this
one
ever
again
and
not
recomend
it
to
anyone
there
are
much
better
beers
for
the
price
out
their
in
the
store
like
its
brethren
corona
this
doesnt
deliver
much
for
flavor
as
expected
but
is
definitely
a
step
above
many
in
its
style
the
taste
is
decent
surprisingly
good
mouthfeel
no
offflavors
wouldnt
mind
throwing
back
a
couple
of
these
pours
a
little
stiller
than
the
standard
bmc
beers
taste
is
more
pleasant
with
a
little
grain
taste
and
less
skunkiness
than
most
mexibeers
its
a
real
easy
drinker
on
a
hot
day
thanks
to
the
wateriness
and
the
low
abv
there
were
pbrs
miller
lites
and
this
in
the
fridge
i
kept
going
with
the
xxs
thats
all
the
praise
ill
offer
this
one
i
had
been
curious
about
this
particular
beer
for
awhile
so
i
purchased
a
six
pack
of
bottles
at
a
local
convenience
store
definitely
not
a
great
beer
but
certainly
not
a
bad
one
the
beer
was
a
pale
yellow
with
no
real
distinct
odor
that
i
was
able
to
detect
although
it
had
a
slightly
sweet
smell
to
it
the
taste
was
quite
clean
and
rather
on
the
light
side
this
is
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
would
picture
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
drinking
but
it
would
not
be
a
bad
beer
served
ice
cold
with
some
wings
or
good
mexican
food
overall
the
can
is
so
much
better
than
the
bottle
but
still
one
of
my
least
favorite
mexican
beers
o
its
a
nice
beer
definitely
not
offensive
has
great
drinkability
all
in
all
it
has
its
place
just
an
average
beer
for
this
style
the
weird
aroma
really
distracts
from
things
as
well
drinkable
sure
makes
you
want
more
not
unless
there
is
absolutely
nothing
else
available
i
had
it
with
an
average
plate
of
wings
at
the
mundane
buffalo
wild
wings
in
tacoma
on
a
wednesday
overall
not
the
best
of
the
mexican
beers
but
inexpensive
and
great
for
a
hot
day
bit
too
much
corn
going
on
overall
so
apparently
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
drinks
the
most
uninteresting
beer
in
the
world
cool
ive
had
tap
water
with
more
character
reading
the
date
code
i
believe
this
was
bottled
on
january
30th
2012
if
these
kinds
of
beers
are
supposed
to
quench
ones
thirst
then
i
guess
everyone
is
taking
interesting
mans
motto
of
stay
thirsty
my
friends
to
heart
as
indifferent
as
i
am
to
this
beer
it
is
a
candidate
for
a
rereview
overall
this
trumps
the
natty
daddy
that
i
just
had
no
contest
natty
had
a
bizarre
sweetness
to
it
but
dos
equis
is
actually
a
decent
adjunct
lager
in
comparison
to
budweiser
or
coors
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
more
as
it
doesnt
have
that
extremely
skunky
corn
aroma
or
flavor
quite
carbonated
and
lacking
flavor
that
damn
metallic
taste
but
still
a
decent
choice
if
you
want
to
get
a
buzz
summary
as
a
lager
this
is
overall
pretty
poor
the
smell
and
taste
is
nonexistent
and
it
is
much
too
fizzy
to
be
enjoyable
on
its
own
with
a
lime
wedge
and
some
nice
texmex
however
dos
equis
is
a
great
option
i
tried
the
bottled
version
i
was
very
impressed
i
really
came
to
believe
that
all
mexican
beers
were
as
bad
as
the
american
but
it
wasnt
the
case
this
beer
is
above
average
very
smooth
very
drinkable
dos
equis
became
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
watching
a
game
o
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
aroma
is
good
but
no
flavours
not
a
great
beer
by
any
standard
but
in
the
mexican
adjunct
category
its
not
bad
at
all
draft
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
lager
with
a
medium
white
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
overly
sweet
adjunct
is
quite
gross
taste
is
also
dominated
by
loads
of
gross
sweet
adjunct
notes
with
a
bland
aftertaste
body
is
light
with
light
oily
notes
overly
sweet
bland
lager
serving
type
bottle
overall
terrible
terrible
beer
im
more
than
willing
to
tolerate
an
adjunct
lager
but
not
this
i
find
myself
alone
no
where
is
there
a
trace
of
my
captors
or
anyone
else
i
am
a
null
in
the
void
i
feel
completely
alone
in
the
universe
there
is
no
light
in
the
darkness
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
definitely
a
good
one
either
i
am
pretty
sure
during
the
right
climate
it
is
incredibly
appreciated
salud
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
ok
the
brew
smells
like
sweet
malt
corn
and
some
light
citrus
it
tastes
like
sweet
malt
and
corn
not
much
to
this
brew
at
all
mouthfeelbody
is
light
and
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
its
really
not
bad
but
its
not
exactly
good
either
i
have
no
problem
drinking
this
occasionally
but
i
wouldnt
make
a
point
to
buy
it
got
a
bottle
from
one
of
my
buddies
for
free
so
i
figured
i
might
as
well
tick
it
the
lemon
piece
that
i
took
out
for
degustation
would
help
to
hide
its
flaws
overall
thin
watery
and
without
much
flavour
a
little
sweet
corn
and
grains
nice
on
a
hot
day
when
you
dont
need
flavour
so
much
as
you
do
refreshment
i
still
say
that
there
are
better
beers
even
in
this
price
range
au43
a
case
in
2012
the
taste
is
quite
grainy
with
a
slight
acidity
and
crisp
hop
ending
here
is
a
beer
with
a
popular
advertising
campaign
and
it
is
a
average
to
above
average
for
the
style
there
is
no
way
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
drinks
this
beer
it
is
not
the
least
interesting
beer
in
the
world
but
worse
it
clearly
tastes
like
an
adjunct
lager
but
its
not
as
carbonated
as
bud
and
the
like
to
at
least
improve
the
feel
i
would
prefer
a
bud
because
while
the
flavor
isnt
as
strong
it
goes
down
easier
realistically
i
wouldnt
want
either
but
for
those
rare
times
i
want
cheap
beer
im
not
getting
xx
love
the
commercials
but
the
beer
is
a
tad
bit
lacking
it
pours
well
and
the
head
looks
good
but
its
taste
is
a
bit
watery
feels
fine
in
the
mouth
but
it
has
that
spilledbeerinabar
smell
not
the
kind
of
aroma
that
inspires
one
to
spend
lots
of
money
on
the
stale
and
off
character
here
is
pretty
grim
not
whether
its
the
batch
or
this
beer
in
general
but
not
eager
to
rush
out
to
find
out
owill
pass
it
in
the
future
o
this
actually
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
i
would
be
ive
had
this
beer
more
than
several
times
over
the
years
and
finally
got
a
chance
to
review
it
here
since
its
pretty
drinkable
and
a
decent
sweetness
in
the
taste
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
aals
out
there
o
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
really
anything
special
with
this
beer
overall
i
have
to
say
id
never
buy
this
beer
again
if
someone
handed
me
one
id
down
it
without
a
thought
but
as
far
a
plopping
down
money
for
one
no
way
its
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
it
just
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
outside
of
the
fact
that
its
wet
cold
and
if
you
drink
enough
you
could
catch
a
buzz
great
advert
campaign
but
i
guess
this
review
renders
me
the
least
interesting
man
in
the
world
o
this
beer
isnt
horrible
but
the
taste
is
relatively
bland
and
uninteresting
very
subtle
grainy
flavor
with
a
watery
feel
goes
down
easy
with
a
crisp
finish
despite
the
lack
of
flavor
i
find
it
to
be
fairly
inoffensive
this
is
a
good
choice
if
you
are
eating
something
spicy
like
mexican
or
anything
with
a
strong
flavor
i
do
not
recommend
drinking
this
on
its
own
not
enough
taste
to
be
had
o
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
thats
about
it

similar

clean
bitterness
is
missed
even
though
someone
left
a
few
of
these
at
my
house
so
i
figured
why
not
ive
been
drinking
ipas
so
maybe
being
a
little
buzzed
will
help
it
go
down
poured
from
a
green
bottled
12
oz
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
high
foaming
white
head
which
leaves
some
type
of
lacingleft
over
foam
with
a
light
yellow
color
the
smells
are
pretty
light
and
a
little
watery
maybe
some
adjuncts
the
feel
is
light
and
watery
the
taste
is
about
the
same
not
really
my
thing
but
to
each
their
own
thankfully
i
didnt
pay
for
them
picked
up
a
six
pack
right
before
a
nice
few
hours
cleaning
the
pool
wonderful
mouthfeel
and
a
great
taste
make
this
stuff
what
it
is
if
mexico
has
this
stuff
why
do
they
still
make
corona
its
sad
that
most
people
think
of
corona
when
they
think
of
mexican
beer
cant
say
much
for
the
smell
because
well
why
in
the
hell
would
you
be
smelling
a
beer
and
not
drinking
it
but
this
stuff
is
almost
like
a
smoother
slightly
better
tasting
labatt
blue
the
color
was
pretty
much
that
of
a
standard
lager
with
some
carbonation
definitely
not
disappointed
with
this
but
it
must
be
ice
cold
to
be
thoroughly
enjoyed
seriously
its
summer
time
dont
be
pretentious
grab
a
dos
equis
special
or
like
10
final
thoughts
to
be
honest
if
i
was
blindfolded
and
given
this
i
would
think
someone
filled
the
glass
5050
bud
and
bud
light
not
interested
personally
but
it
could
have
been
alot
worse
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
sugar
and
some
metallic
aromas
taste
is
the
same
but
there
is
also
an
off
flavor
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
is
almost
medicinal
there
is
a
very
light
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
that
is
somewhat
undrinkable
especially
with
the
off
flavor
i
am
getting
t
light
somewhat
lemony
watery
little
in
the
way
of
hops
of
course
and
the
malt
is
not
all
that
prominent
either
very
easy
going
down
and
no
wretched
aftertaste
thats
not
bad
for
this
genre
so
it
gets
higher
marks
than
most
of
this
sort
overall
only
on
cinco
de
mayo
imo
it
was
better
than
some
other
beers
of
the
same
kind
but
thats
about
it
certainly
not
what
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
would
drink
oonly
on
cinco
de
mayo
thin
and
gross
light
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
mexican
brewed
adjuncts
oprobably
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
but
nothing
special
24
ounce
can
states
crafted
in
mexico
since
1897
to
commemorate
the
arrival
of
the
20th
century
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
with
fizzy
carbonation
forming
a
white
head
that
dwindles
quickly
aroma
has
corn
and
rice
adjuncts
with
a
slightly
metallic
note
not
bad
overall
another
mass
produced
lager
for
sure
cereal
grains
noted
for
sure
full
of
creamed
corn
and
cooke
veggie
notes
this
beer
is
something
else
to
be
entertained
by
tastes
like
a
cooked
vegetable
note
with
cereal
corn
and
rice
grains
in
the
flavor
minimal
hops
becomes
cloying
after
a
short
amount
of
imbibing
not
the
best
or
worst
beer
ive
ever
tried
but
something
i
shall
steer
clear
of
in
the
future
god
bless
america
this
is
horrible
adjunct
lager
we
are
forced
to
drink
due
to
an
large
amount
of
mexicans
entering
the
culture
always
a
beer
i
enjoyed
the
amber
lager
version
of
the
lager
especial
just
isnt
up
to
my
standards
o
an
easy
drinking
mild
flavoured
lager
that
is
suitable
for
hot
sunny
days
typical
mexican
import
that
doesnt
bring
much
to
the
table
not
bad
overall
nothing
to
spectacular
here
doesnt
really
have
a
huge
taste
and
the
nose
and
appearance
leave
something
to
be
desired
from
now
on
this
beer
will
reminds
me
the
cacun
sun
and
the
great
time
i
had
at
least
its
that
overall
i
found
this
one
to
be
great
poured
this
american
adjunct
lager
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
straw
color
produced
a
average
white
head
with
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
off
putting
smelled
of
sweet
corn
and
some
grain
light
in
body
this
macro
mexican
brewed
version
of
a
american
lager
is
thin
with
the
flavor
of
cooked
corn
malted
grain
and
some
small
amount
of
hop
finish
better
then
some
mexican
brewed
american
beers
i
e
corona
but
still
a
sub
par
low
quality
brew
prost
o
its
nothing
amazing
but
a
decent
brew
to
have
with
a
meal
that
has
a
lot
of
flavors
spice
haha
almost
like
mexican
its
not
overwhelming
but
its
definitely
a
macro
that
id
choose
again
o
didnt
expect
much
and
got
a
macro
produced
lager
as
expected
dont
expect
the
slick
marketing
to
make
it
anything
special
d
just
another
run
of
the
mill
adjunct
lager
with
some
spanish
branding
on
it
avoid
overall
an
above
average
american
adjunct
lager
worthy
of
a
try
in
my
opinion
neighbor
had
a
case
for
the
superbowl
so
i
took
one
its
been
a
while
poured
to
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
head
that
has
some
retention
and
lacing
but
not
much
the
nose
is
strong
in
grassy
tones
but
not
a
lot
else
to
report
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
that
starts
off
with
a
sweetness
i
likened
to
corn
with
hints
of
barely
and
a
mild
bitterness
finishes
with
a
hint
of
grass
and
cereal
grain
light
bodied
and
decently
carbonated
overall
i
remember
loving
this
beer
in
high
school
my
tastes
have
changed
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
though
my
any
means
on
tap
at
chilis
not
a
very
good
beer
there
are
a
handful
of
other
mexican
lagers
id
rather
drink
m
mouthfeel
its
moist
with
a
drip
of
citrus
about
what
i
expected
o
this
is
another
subpar
lager
i
honestly
dont
understand
why
this
beer
is
so
hyped
by
mainstream
drinkers
overall
not
a
very
remarkable
beer
but
not
offensive
either
a
good
choice
for
washing
down
some
dinner
dos
equis
slightly
edges
out
most
macros
in
terms
of
smell
mouthfeel
and
flavor
but
not
enough
to
compensate
for
the
premium
price
think
of
it
as
mexican
bud
for
when
you
want
to
look
more
cultured
than
your
plebeian
friends
and
to
my
fellow
beer
enthusiasts
stay
thirsty
my
friends
or
else
you
wont
want
to
touch
this
o
very
boring
and
below
average
even
for
an
aal
if
you
like
mexican
beer
at
least
go
for
a
modelo
or
something
you
would
think
the
worlds
most
interesting
man
would
drink
and
interesting
beer
but
what
can
you
do
avoid
dos
equis
thats
what
overall
just
a
awful
beer
why
do
people
buy
this
shit
thin
head
doesnt
last
long
disappointing
pale
clear
yellow
body
pale
malts
not
much
flavor
kinda
grassy
very
easy
drinking
this
is
the
most
waterlike
beer
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
on
water
go
for
this
beer
o
i
got
this
in
a
build
your
own
sixpack
special
and
even
with
low
expectations
i
did
not
enjoy
this
one
bit
it
was
like
a
mexican
pissed
into
a
glass
bottle
filled
the
rest
with
water
froze
it
and
shipped
it
to
my
liquor
store
if
given
this
beer
for
free
i
would
actually
refuse
it
tasted
as
bad
as
it
smelled
with
its
musk
and
watery
smell
and
nothing
set
this
beer
apart
from
other
adjuncts
i
apologize
if
this
was
a
slammer
but
i
honestly
have
nothing
positive
to
say
about
this
beer
and
felt
my
review
should
show
my
honesty
final

macro
lagers
go
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
though
thats
obviously
not
saying
much
o
well
this
definitely
is
a
cut
above
modelo
especial
and
tends
to
be
refreshing
while
sitting
in
the
sun
on
the
beach
i
would
say
the
amber
version
edges
this
one
out
all
in
all
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
or
offensive
just
bland
and
flavorless
as
i
would
expect
overall
to
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
you
picked
a
very
uninteresting
beer
to
drink
overall
seems
closer
to
heineken
than
corona
not
bad
but
not
a
whole
ton
of
flavor
or
a
whole
lot
going
on
ill
drink
it
but
it
isnt
my
preferred
style
o
this
would
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
as
far
as
macrolagers
go
this
is
not
a
bad
choice
full
carbonation
fizzy
and
foamy
smells
skunked
although
i
think
thats
how
its
supposed
to
smell
to
say
no
flavor
is
a
lie
theres
a
flavor
here
but
its
not
pleasant
thin
body
leaves
me
with
that
nasty
beer
mouth
feeling
how
did
i
ever
drink
so
much
of
this
one
in
the
past
adding
salt
and
squeezing
a
lime
would
improve
the
flavor
only
because
then
it
would
taste
like
salt
and
lime
in
fact
midway
through
i
ended
up
squeezing
the
lime
into
it
my
friends
treat
and
i
appreciate
the
gesture
o
overall
for
a
south
of
the
border
lager
is
is
not
too
bad
light
and
refreshing
while
still
having
a
bit
of
flavor
dr
very
drinkable
and
pairs
well
with
mexican
food
the
price
is
high
and
the
quality
is
low
othis
beer
is
designed
for
drinking
mass
quantities
of
so
for
what
its
worth
it
is
pretty
easy
to
get
down
it
is
better
than
many
other
adjunct
lagers
but
does
not
really
add
anything
i
would
say
it
is
better
than
other
domestics
but
is
not
very
useful
for
anything
besides
a
hot
summer
day
o
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
alternative
to
the
common
beers
o
perhaps
better
than
your
typical
macro
but
still
not
very
good
o
i
dont
always
drink
lagers
produced
in
mexico
but
when
i
do
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
i
prefer
it
to
its
amber
counterpart
and
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
adjunct
lagers
out
there
o
smooth
and
inoffensive
this
is
my
choice
with
light
mexican
fair
especially
considering
most
cheap
mexican
restaurants
dont
have
any
better
offerings
helps
when
eating
the
really
spicy
stuff
just
fine
too
which
i
love
pours
a
goldenyellow
color
and
smells
of
grain
grasses
and
perhaps
some
citrus
flavor
is
fairly
mild
and
watery
with
a
sweet
grain
and
citrus
flavor
finish
is
slightly
bitter
yet
pleasant
tasting
drank
this
at
a
birthday
bbq
and
it
really
hit
the
spot
though
if
youre
looking
for
complexity
look
elsewhere
i
love
this
cervezai
have
tried
a
few
spanish
brews
that
i
have
not
been
impressed
it
smell
like
a
little
skunky
but
the
taste
is
great
mouthfeel
is
like
a
bud
and
this
beer
is
very
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
try
this
beer
and
you
will
not
be
mad
with
yourself
not
horrific
for
the
style
but
i
find
that
this
could
be
better
wanted
some
crisp
edges
got
some
bitter
edges
but
some
sugars
where
i
didnt
want
them
skunk
is
skunk
and
the
nose
wasnt
so
overpowering
to
make
this
entirely
offputting
but
this
is
middle
of
the
road
american
adjunct
cheers
drink
it
is
what
it
is
low
abv
low
flavor
for
the
masses
o
this
is
a
decent
option
for
a
picnic
on
a
warm
summer
day
a
little
more
flavor
than
most
adjuncts
my
pour
netted
me
a
finger
of
foaming
fizzy
bonewhite
head
with
lousy
retention
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
the
all
toofamiliar
cereal
quality
associated
with
aals
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
the
light
lager
taste
that
is
a
staple
of
the
style
finish
was
refreshing
sure
but
it
was
cold
and
it
is
a
hot
day
so
water
might
be
equally
refreshing
it
was
not
bad
but
it
was
simply
a
standard
interpretation
of
a
lesser
style
d
not
the
best
not
the
worst
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
youre
at
the
airport
in
san
antonio
no
complaints
here
it
is
what
it
is
and
thats
not
bad
i
like
it
alot
it
is
nothing
special
but
very
drinkable
and
has
a
solid
taste
the
only
problem
is
that
i
can
get
just
as
good
a
beer
for
way
less
i
would
definetly
drink
this
beer
again
and
will
enjoy
several
at
the
event
im
going
to
appearance
is
an
amber
color
with
a
paltry
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
i
couldnt
pick
up
much
scent
maybe
some
very
weak
bread
but
at
least
theres
nothing
funky
going
on
here
taste
was
surprisingly
decent
for
an
aal
malt
flavors
with
a
slight
hint
of
lemon
or
lime
a
little
sweetness
and
a
buttery
taste
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thin
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
and
goes
great
with
some
mexican
food
if
your
beer
choices
are
slim
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
to
make
compared
to
other
aals
overallthe
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
should
stick
to
whatever
other
beverage
he
drinks
this
beer
sucks
overall
a
utilitarian
lager
that
does
the
job
on
a
90f
early
evening
the
first
one
i
had
as
soon
as
i
got
home
from
work
actually
delivered
more
simple
satisfaction
straight
outta
the
green
bottle
this
one
isnt
to
be
disectedpondered
mouthfeel
best
thing
about
this
beer
its
like
what
and
quenches
my
summer
hotness
its
not
terrible
but
it
really
has
no
life
to
it
the
only
thing
going
for
it
is
the
crisp
finish
its
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
d
typical
mass
produced
and
massmarketed
beer
makes
a
good
beer
to
drink
in
the
summer
time
under
the
sun
poured
a
perfectly
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
bone
white
head
that
diminished
but
did
not
disappear
it
smells
metallic
of
corn
and
cereal
grains
it
has
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
of
dry
bland
bread
i
often
dont
mind
if
my
beer
just
tastes
like
bread
but
this
doesnt
taste
like
very
good
bread
though
ive
had
worse
its
a
tad
bit
starchy
the
dryness
is
notable
its
definitely
not
overly
sweet
like
many
adjunct
lagers
but
the
taste
is
disagreeable
im
not
buying
this
again
ill
be
sticking
with
sol
as
my
mexican
beer
of
choice
o
love
the
adcampaign
but
pass
on
this
beer
for
me
admittedly
i
had
a
few
these
10
years
ago
while
on
vacation
in
rosarito
before
i
knew
any
better
but
adjunct
lagers
no
longer
satisfy
and
dos
equis
special
lager
is
no
exception
the
amber
variant
is
marginally
better
though
onot
an
awful
beer
for
a
hot
mexican
day
though
it
seems
to
get
more
watery
its
best
to
keep
your
glass
full
i
definitely
prefer
this
to
the
us
macros
it
has
more
flavor
and
is
more
balanced
finishes
off
with
a
thick
creamy
milky
mouthfeel
happy
cinco
de
mayo
o
i
buy
this
from
time
to
time
when
having
crab
legs
i
think
this
and
corona
go
perfectly
with
crabs
but
i
would
not
drink
this
alone
overall
this
beer
has
nothing
to
bring
to
the
table
poured
like
a
typical
macro
straw
color
thin
head
that
fizzled
out
fizzy
carbonation
rancid
aroma
mulched
grass
and
stale
hops
which
carried
through
in
the
taste
light
watered
down
mouthfeel
with
no
real
flavor
at
all
sickeningly
sweet
aftertaste
with
lots
of
funk
and
skunk
too
be
avoided
the
xx
amber
is
a
lot
better
in
my
opinion
overall
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
it
might
be
drinkable
but
its
drinkability
doesnt
do
it
justice
its
just
plain
gross
and
i
will
pass
it
up
every
time
i
see
it
no
wonder
my
wife
likes
it
another
at
my
watering
hole
typical
yellow
fizzy
brew
in
a
pint
shaker
glass
little
to
no
head
and
no
lacing
no
aroma
that
i
could
pick
up
taste
was
probably
slightly
better
than
the
other
yellow
fizzy
brews
on
the
tour
sweet
malt
corn
crisp
no
bitetaste
standard
average
mexican
brew
good
on
a
hot
day
im
sure
but
nothing
to
analyze
too
deeply
i
hate
to
pour
beer
down
the
drain
but
i
might
just
save
myself
the
calories
honestly
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
just
might
prefer
a
coors
light
over
this
one
steer
clear
of
them
both
pours
a
2
soap
bubble
head
clear
straw
yellow
in
color
smells
of
corn
or
some
other
nondescript
grain
taste
is
water
with
a
hint
of
grain
and
hint
of
sweetener
theres
the
slightest
of
a
zing
overall
thirst
quenching
and
nothing
at
all
disagreeable
the
epitome
of
average
c
they
say
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
drinks
this
well
if
thats
true
then
he
chose
the
boring
to
balance
out
all
the
rest
of
that
excitement
drinkability
is
amazing
in
this
beer
the
best
mexican
lager
by
far
it
is
refreshing
and
smooth
all
the
way
down
you
can
drink
them
all
day
long
in
nice
weather
and
it
has
a
good
taste
to
match
unlike
other
watered
down
mexicans
corona
d
high
on
drinkability
i
think
the
amber
dos
equis
is
a
better
quality
beer
and
would
get
that
over
this
any
day
would
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
to
me
by
a
friend
or
something
but
its
lacking
in
flavor
and
body
an
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
its
better
than
most
other
american
adjunct
lagers
but
not
by
much
o
extremely
easy
drinking
because
it
isnt
offensive
in
any
way
id
prefer
this
to
light
lagers
and
the
bmcs
but
on
the
same
hand
id
rather
have
a
pbr
or
schlitz
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
texas
roadhouse
5262008
the
pour
was
a
typical
pale
yellow
the
head
faded
rather
quickly
had
a
little
bit
of
a
skunky
smell
to
it
taste
was
a
little
hoppy
but
not
much
at
all
some
light
grains
and
malts
shine
through
this
type
of
beer
is
so
common
that
its
hard
to
say
much
different
about
it
the
stuff
would
be
outstanding
ice
cold
with
a
plate
of
enchiladas
poured
ontap
at
a
resort
in
mexico
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellowgold
with
a
thin
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
malt
and
corn
the
beer
is
slightly
sour
malt
flavored
with
a
crisp
light
body
minimal
toasty
aftertaste
with
a
quick
light
finish
pretty
easy
to
drink
when
you
have
no
other
choices
dreally
drinkable
most
of
this
style
is
so
i
am
not
suprised
here
d
drinking
several
wouldnt
be
a
problem
this
beer
is
very
average
nothing
offensive
and
nothing
really
interesting
about
it
adding
a
lime
to
it
adds
some
flavor
but
its
still
pretty
mediocre
fairly
easy
drinking
though
poured
into
flared
pilsner
glass
poured
a
clean
clear
straw
gold
with
no
head
thus
no
retention
or
lacing
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
sweet
but
fairly
bland
the
taste
sweet
and
grainy
as
well
the
body
was
fairly
typical
but
had
a
nice
level
carbonation
on
the
tongue
drinkability
was
ok
but
with
a
beer
this
bland
why
bother
i
tried
it
you
dont
have
to
nice
frothy
one
finger
head
with
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
very
pale
clear
straw
body
very
faint
coffee
and
even
fainter
caramelnut
smell
light
tobacco
taste
very
thin
on
the
alcohol
not
particularly
flavorful
very
dry
for
its
style
its
actually
a
decent
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
doesnt
feel
watery
theres
plenty
of
spice
on
the
tongue
i
dont
always
drink
a
dos
equis
but
when
i
do
its
pretty
enjoyable
probably
one
of
the
better
mexican
lagers
ive
had
had
this
on
tap
at
a
mexican
restaurant
because
it
was
happy
hour
and
24
oz
taps
were
2
75
should
have
just
gone
with
the
budweiser
a
brew
that
i
dont
particularly
like
but
would
have
been
a
better
choice
why
do
i
think
that
mexican
beer
is
going
to
taste
better
in
a
mexican
joint
than
a
home
nothing
to
write
home
about
maybe
i
would
think
different
about
this
beer
having
it
in
mexico
but
in
willmar
minnesota
i
could
easily
stick
with
bud
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
but
mostly
malt
and
corn
the
appearance
is
pale
gold
with
a
tiny
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
its
very
inoffensive
and
clean
the
palate
is
typical
for
the
style
overall
not
much
here
in
the
way
of
bad
but
not
much
to
taste
the
only
good
thing
is
that
its
refreshing
taste
simple
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
recall
enjoying
this
one
at
restaurants
but
this
6pack
is
almost
worthy
of
a
drain
pour
i
may
try
another
review
if
i
get
one
while
dinning
out
in
the
future
spring

light
sweet

with
a

of

this
is
ok
beer
besides
the
skunk
smell
that
comes
from
it
green
bottles
dont
help
the
smell
it
has
a
horrible
after
taste
but
takes
ok
when
you
first
sip
it
i
have
to
admit
the
commercials
are
coolput
this
in
a
can
and
it
will
be
better
havent
tried
the
amber
version
yet
hopes
it
better
the
only
really
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
i
ran
out
and
dont
have
to
drink
it
ever
again
d
this
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
good
for
a
hot
day
which
tonight
is
not
light
bodied
average
carbonation
feels
about
average
not
a
good
beer
and
not
the
worst
i
have
had
d
as
far
as
the
mexicansouth
american
beers
go
its
decent
but
its
still
a
diluted
session
beer
ill
take
it
over
coronatecatemodeloetc
light
and
golden
crystal
clear
with
a
minimal
head
some
lacing
present
smell
is
strongly
of
corn
and
grains
a
bit
sweet
nothing
more
nothing
less
at
first
taste
this
beer
introduces
some
very
grainy
and
nutty
flavors
to
the
palate
followed
by
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
very
very
faint
floral
hop
character
that
is
short
lived
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
moderate
carbonation
with
a
very
dry
aftertaste
its
almost
as
if
all
the
saliva
and
moisture
from
the
mouth
has
vanished
after
a
sip
of
this
swill
not
too
refreshing
though
it
does
have
a
crisp
grainycarbonation
bite
to
it
at
first
sip
nothing
to
seek
out
but
it
is
drinkable
just
not
much
going
on
as
far
as
flavor
goes
d
not
really
great
ive
had
it
before
and
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
are
you
supposed
to
start
thirsty
and
stay
thirsty
what
does
the
commercial
imply
tough
to
say
i
guess
as
i
sip
the
watery
lager
i
can
feel
my
beard
growing
more
sexy
by
the
swallow
at
each
faint
brush
of
hop
i
become
more
mysterious
what
kind
of
man
would
drink
such
a
flavorless
beverage
its
tasty
if
you
like
that
wet
dog
flavor
in
a
beer
not
bad
at
all
eh
very
little
to
it
some
faint
hops
and
malt
distinctively
watery
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
standard
appearance
and
the
chuggable
drinkability
while
many
of
these
adjunct
lagers
use
corn
it
is
rarely
exhibited
so
forwardly
in
the
taste
as
it
is
here
leading
to
a
bland
unremarkable
brew
for
the
style
it
passes
but
is
not
necessarily
delectable
by
any
means
not
a
beer
to
get
drunk
on
perhaps
a
gateway
to
liquor
like
i
use
it
for
but
not
for
the
actual
purpose
definitely
good
for
just
relaxing
one
evening
watching
sports
or
a
movie
overall
this
is
a
simple
beer
has
little
characteristics
but
i
can
see
it
being
a
refreshing
summer
beer
would
only
recommend
if
your
into
mexican
lagers
overall
i
think
the
beer
deserves
a
c
good

only

a

when
there
arent

of

but
not
that
great
an
overall
beer
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
erosierdec
09
but
mostly
very
clean
the
taste
is
also
very
clean
not
much
sweetness
not
to
compare
with
the
amber
one
beerdreadzsep
04
and
while
most
of
the
mexican
beers
i
drank
tasted
much
better
than
they
do
in
the
us
giblet
overall
brisk
and
refreshing
but
without
character
and
no
personality
at
all
better
than
sol
and
corona
no
compliment
there
but
still
bland
my
quest
for
a
good
mexican
beer
continues
not
as
good
as
its
amber
brother
but
not
bad
for
a
massproduced
mexican
beer
as
with
most
of
these
its
best
enjoyed
icecold
with
a
squeeze
of
lime
while
eating
chorizo
sausage
or
other
mexican
spicy
dishes
actually
prefer
this
over
many
of
the
bmcs
which
isnt
saying
much
dos
equis
lager
especial
was
golden
in
color
and
very
clear
it
had
a
white
head
that
didnt
last
the
smell
was
light
and
mostly
grain
with
a
little
skunk
the
taste
was
sweet
grainy
and
a
little
harsh
with
a
dry
finish
it
was
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonantion
drinkability
was
below
average
the
dos
equis
amber
was
a
much
better
beer
than
this
one
was
pours
like
any
euro
lager
clean
and
pale
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
the
adjuncts
very
bready
and
grainy
tasted
well
like
a
mgd
adjunct
rich
hints
of
cooked
corn
maybe
a
little
hop
bitterness
what
a
disappointment
if
i
wanted
a
mgd
i
would
have
bought
mgd
and
saved
myself
a
few
bucks
a
good
party
beer
if
everyone
is
tired
of
the
normal
cheap
beers
as
it
has
a
slight
better
taste
than
the
average
beer
served
in
a
mason
jar
this
beer
had
a
faint
gold
mostly
yellow
appearance
with
only
a
few
suds
on
top
due
to
the
streaming
carbonation
coming
up
from
the
bottom
reviewing
it
in
the
style
it
is
made
its
not
a
bad
beer
overall
compared
to
its
competitors
the
smell
is
faint
grain
combined
with
alcohol
basically
the
same
aroma
you
get
from
other
macros
that
arent
skunked
the
taste
was
very
faint
malt
alcohol
but
not
too
much
of
a
carbonated
bite
which
is
why
i
rate
the
mouthfeel
at
a
little
bit
better
than
average
not
a
horrible
beer
it
had
slightly
more
sustenance
than
its
competitors
picked
up
at
costco
in
a
mexican
beer
sample
case
of
sol
dos
equis
lager
dos
equis
amber
and
tecate
they
were
out
of
sams
brewmaster
collection
so
i
gave
this
a
whirl
bottle
smell
is
a
strange
braunschweiger
poured
into
my
chalice
with
little
to
no
head
color
is
golden
with
a
bronze
hint
there
is
now
a
slight
corn
smell
taste
is
quite
bland
not
sweet
not
bitter
almost
without
flavor
only
a
slight
hop
finish
the
carbonation
is
evident
and
actually
more
prevalent
than
anything
else
this
is
definitely
only
a
lawnmower
beer
nothing
at
all
to
brag
about
here
maybe
this
is
a
bad
bottle
for
some
reason
if
trying
another
improves
i
will
return
to
edit
this
review
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
and
it
goes
down
easy
but
like
most
macros
it
doesnt
taste
good
one
is
about
all
i
can
handle
its
not
enticing
enough
for
another
overall
its
not
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
all
in
all
an
ok
mexican
beer
i
pair
this
beer
with
stuffed
jalopanos
and
the
hottest
mexican
fare
it
quenches
the
thirst
and
is
much
better
than
carona
typical
pale
gold
with
little
head
malt
overdoes
the
grain
in
the
nose
and
has
a
pinch
of
hop
taste
goes
downhill
from
the
aromas
and
is
just
selztery
flavors
start
off
decent
but
then
plummet
into
nothingness
pretty
quickly
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
spritzy
i
can
down
this
alright
d
easily
drunk
and
not
bad
overall
much
better
than
corona
sol
pacifico
and
others
of
its
ilk
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
thin
white
head
is
gone
in
seconds
aroma
is
light
caramel
grain
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
taste
is
sweet
and
grainy
up
front
with
a
mild
grassy
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
body
not
much
more
to
say
one
you
will
not
sit
and
ponder
but
a
solid
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
taste
is
barely
a
notch
above
the
macrobrewed
american
junk
metallic
some
rice
and
hop
notes
present
the
mouthfeel
is
the
highlight
of
this
beer
surprisingly
hoppy
aftertaste
with
a
nice
juciness
and
smooth
finish
overall
it
lacks
any
noticable
complexity
but
you
can
drink
it
all
night
goes
down
easily
d
easy
to
drink
not
very
filling
it
went
well
with
my
quesadilla
but
the
beer
itself
was
not
very
tasty
in
my
humble
opinion
this
is
the
best
american
macro
around
appearance
is
kinda
flat
but
the
smell
picks
it
up
much
sharper
than
most
macros
and
no
corn
smell
taste
is
similar
to
a
euro
pale
mouthfeel
is
light
but
decent
drinkability
is
fantastic
a
fair
to
average
mexican
lager
a
bit
spicer
than
some
others
but
its
also
a
bit
more
tedious
than
some
others
the
dos
equis
amber
is
much
better
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
prefer
a
heineken
style
finish
not
as
good
as
on
draft
add
a
lime
at
the
bottom
of
a
glass
then
pour
in
and
enjoy
for
a
twist
overall
decent
for
texmex
fare
when
nothing
better
is
available
its
agreeable
though
neutral
definitely
benefits
from
a
frosty
mug
and
a
lime
overall
its
a
pretty
average
beer
better
than
corona
in
my
opinion
but
a
little
over
priced
i
dont
know
if
its
the
water
or
what
but
all
mexican
beers
have
that
skunkiness
to
them
and
this
is
no
exception
no
lime
required
on
this
one
its
not
as
skunky
as
corona
i
actually
prefer
xx
over
it
corn
adjucts
present
a
little
more
flavorful
than
other
mex
beers
not
too
bad
at
the
price
though
ill
pass
the
head
wasnt
impressive
in
the
bottle
and
it
would
dissapear
quick
after
each
sip
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
taste
it
started
with
a
cornlike
sweetness
and
ended
in
cooked
veggies
with
a
mild
spicy
hoppiness
though
not
overpowering
despite
being
a
middleoftheroad
brew
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
cut
the
spiciness
on
my
palate
from
the
burrito
ive
definately
had
worse
macros
especially
in
green
bottles
or
from
mexico
this
one
can
be
filed
under
clean
and
unoffensive
like
heineken
but
with
a
little
less
flavor
it
was
just
sweet
with
a
faint
taste
of
adjuncts
a
lime
doesnt
really
ruin
this
one
or
cover
up
flavor
so
much
as
improve
upon
a
nearly
blank
slate
of
a
beer
although
it
lacks
in
the
flavor
department
is
watereddown
and
overly
husky
its
not
the
worst
mexican
beer
ive
had
but
thats
not
saying
much
in
fact
it
says
virtually
nothing
in
fact
i
would
prefer
some
american
macros
if
i
had
to
over
this
beats
corona
and
some
other
mexican
beers
ive
had
but
still
is
not
worthwhile
even
for
the
style
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
mexican
beers
i
have
tried
no
need
to
salt
the
mug
and
stick
a
lime
in
this
one
a
pale
amber
in
appearance
light
head
and
moderate
lacing
down
the
glass
this
isnt
a
bad
session
beer
best
enjoyed
buy
the
bucket
outside
when
south
of
the
border
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
i
would
actually
drink
in
the
future
but
include
the
limes
in
it
does
a
nice
job
of
going
with
chips
and
salsa
as
well
as
texmex
food
nothing
complex
not
the
best
flavor
but
still
a
good
thirst
quencher
and
goes
down
easy
with
food
poured
into
a
big
ol
mug
dark
yellow
decent
head
smell
is
not
very
strong
taste
is
good
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
overall
its
really
an
average
beer
in
my
opinion
nothing
really
bad
about
it
its
just
so
average
to
me
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
this
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
head
it
had
a
hoppy
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
and
slightly
salty
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
this
is
one
of
those
that
is
drinkable
very
cold
on
a
hot
day
this
is
very
average
beer
but
quenching
orale
this
is
really
a
situational
beer
only
for
me
i
only
drink
it
when
im
eating
mexican
food
as
it
complements
perfectly
it
does
not
stand
well
on
its
own
though
so
i
will
score
it
accordingly
drinkability
is
top
notch
a
thin
yellow
beer
with
crazy
soda
carbonation
not
much
smell
and
a
very
thin
grain
taste
with
bitter
bite
and
prominant
booziness
mothfeel
is
prettymuch
like
watery
soda
definately
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
for
mexican
lager
move
along
folks
nothing
to
see
here
dos
equis
falls
into
the
third
camp
the
taste
starts
off
with
hops
which
were
all
but
absent
in
the
aroma
and
finishes
with
a
grainy
sweetness
no
es
nada
especial
but
its
not
so
bad
get
my
buzz
on
y
d
it
is
like
german
lager
with
corn
adjuncts
on
the
high
end
of
mexican
beers
which
doesnt
say
much
but
this
beer
is
actually
not
bad
i
tend
to
lean
torward
this
if
given
the
choice
between
macros
smooths
out
spicy
food
so
it
does
have
that
going
for
it
good
beer
to
wash
tacos
down
with
saludas
this
is
about
your
best
bet
for
a
decent
beer
when
eating
at
most
mexican
restaurantsor
maybe
negor
modelo
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
low
carbonation
and
lacing
smell
is
not
unlike
the
tortilla
chips
moderately
corny
the
taste
is
very
mild
with
corn
dominating
all
flavors
and
a
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
what
one
would
expect
in
this
style
beer
this
a
very
smooth
drinker
that
is
not
overly
heavy
on
the
stomach
a
good
bet
for
warm
weather
during
outdoor
activities
dos
equis
special
lager
pours
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
smell
is
corn
maybe
corn
husk
tastes
like
adjunct
especially
corn
and
cereal
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
one
to
throw
a
wedge
of
lime
into
and
drink
on
a
hot
day
review
is
no
lime
no
reason
to
recommend
this
beer
appearance
is
pretty
boring
light
yellow
golden
color
with
small
white
head
that
leaves
very
little
to
no
lacing
smell
is
grainy
taste
is
grainy
watery
and
a
bit
of
a
sweet
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
watery
this
beer
is
light
on
taste
as
is
typical
with
macros
while
this
earns
it
little
points
in
the
taste
department
it
does
make
it
fairly
drinkable
overall
a
typical
mexican
american
macro
lager
i
think
mexican
breweries
should
stick
to
the
vienna
larger
style
d
decent
drinkability
if
you
are
looking
to
wash
some
nasty
nachos
down
at
the
cheesy
hotel
happy
hour
on
the
beach
other
than
that
i
cant
recommend
this
drinks
okay
if
you
like
oversweet
lagers
would
go
okay
with
some
firery
foods
but
dissapoints
on
its
own
i
remember
this
being
better
maybe
memory
is
playing
tricks
i
guess
this
is
the
type
of
beer
to
drink
with
some
flamethrowing
mexican
dish
because
there
isnt
much
taste
its
a
yellow
beer
with
a
small
white
head
it
had
a
mildly
floral
aroma
and
that
is
about
all
youll
get
from
it
i
couldnt
taste
much
of
anything
very
insipid
drink
it
if
you
must
with
some
spicy
dish
otherwise
leave
it
alone
drinkability
is
good
for
what
this
is
which
is
a
mexican
lager
and
the
best
of
the
mexicans
ive
had
drink
xx
with
a
big
plate
of
texmex
enchiladas
and
its
the
perfect
compliment
poured
a
clear
amber
body
with
a
fairly
insignificant
head
the
head
disappeared
quite
quickly
smelled
okay
if
a
bit
bland
some
hops
in
the
taste
no
malts
hint
of
caramel
mouthfeel
was
syrupy
average
salud
overall
an
average
beer
when
drinking
it
alone
but
with
food
this
beer
is
magnificent
its
obvious
that
you
dont
want
a
beer
so
flavorful
and
strong
with
a
full
meal
that
it
overpowers
the
food
youre
eating
and
while
dos
equis
does
have
some
flavors
it
maintains
itself
subservient
to
the
meal
you
eat
which
is
why
i
rated
it
better
than
some
one
must
look
at
the
common
intended
use
for
the
beer
before
one
attacks
it
on
characteristics
reserved
for
beers
meant
to
be
drank
alone
dos
equis
is
a
notch
above
most
of
the
other
big
name
mexican
beers
that
ive
had
but
thats
not
a
large
notch
pale
thin
almost
flavorless
this
beer
gives
the
advertisement
of
being
a
thirst
quenching
summer
fav
but
it
gets
old
after
a
while
i
didnt
really
detect
much
of
a
nose
from
it
other
than
the
dry
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
hop
masked
corn
tastes
kind
of
skunky
but
i
think
in
this
case
that
is
a
bit
of
a
good
thing
there
isnt
much
else
going
for
it
again
this
beer
feels
typical
of
most
large
pilslager
styles
the
only
way
i
would
recommend
this
beer
is
to
grab
a
twelve
pack
grab
your
beach
gear
and
go
get
drunk
in
the
sun
dos
equis
special
is
a
poor
mans
dos
equis
amber
thats
probably
an
unfair
comparison
since
the
latter
is
a
vienna
lager
and
almost
certainly
contains
higher
quality
ingredients
other
than
color
the
bottles
and
labels
are
identical
so
make
sure
to
buy
the
average
one
amber
rather
than
the
lousy
one
special
better
yet
grab
a
sixer
of
bohemia
instead
youre
welcome
a
refreshing
lager
enjoyed
best
on
the
beach
with
a
slice
of
lime
but
then
again
all
beer
tastes
better
when
your
in
the
sun
on
the
beach
while
a
lime
is
not
required
it
does
enhance
the
flavor
of
the
beer
it
is
because
of
its
smooth
sweet
taste
or
maybe
the
lime
just
goes
with
the
green
bottle
i
wouldnt
recommend
a
lime
with
the
amber
verison
of
dos
xx
cheers
to
mexico
a
standard
beachbeer
why
are
there
no
good
beers
sold
at
the
beach
anyhow
this
one
albeit
grainy
and
biteey
has
a
cleanliness
and
crispness
with
it
sweetness
is
low
in
the
aromas
and
flavors
again
the
malt
profile
included
adjunct
grains
and
contribute
a
vegetable
flavor
flavors
fade
leaving
a
light
medicinal
flavor
remaining
more
biteey
toward
the
finish
a
little
dry
still
a
thirst
quincher
but
not
for
serious
beer
tasting
one
good
attribute
of
this
beer
would
be
its
drinkability
on
a
warm
summer
day
if
you
want
to
drink
six
or
more
this
could
be
a
somewhat
decent
option
poured
this
beer
in
zihuatanejo
and
puerto
vallarta
and
it
tasted
so
good
being
so
hot
out
side
this
has
to
be
my
best
mexican
beer
second
is
modelo
especial
the
rest
of
the
mexican
beer
you
can
have
this
had
a
nice
clean
flavor
and
had
a
fairly
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
not
over
powering
flavor
just
medium
mild
and
a
good
quincher
on
hot
muggy
days
if
it
was
cheaper
id
say
go
for
it
and
drink
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
but
you
wont
be
impressed
this
beer
has
a
milder
taste
than
a
lot
of
lagers
but
its
special
a
great
alternative
to
corona
this
beer
has
a
real
nice
sweeter
smell
with
a
citric
afterstaste
nice
and
hoppy
poured
with
a
medium
head
not
much
to
brag
about
thought
this
beer
tasted
very
nice
i
will
undoubtedly
drink
it
again
recommended
especially
for
lighter
drinkers
straight
from
the
bottle
its
a
rather
bland
beer
theres
no
noteworthy
characteristics
about
the
nose
and
im
going
to
have
to
assume
that
the
head
and
lacing
is
pretty
much
in
line
with
just
about
every
other
american
style
macro
lager
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
taste
is
not
bad
nothing
at
all
to
complain
about
except
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
have
more
flavor
you
could
easily
forget
what
youre
drinking
with
this
one
because
theres
absolutely
nothing
that
stands
out
about
it
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
like
a
better
more
pleasant
budweiser
but
even
less
memorable
you
could
drink
this
beer
like
water
its
got
no
inherent
flaws
other
than
being
entirely
generic
final
thought
about
how
i
thought
it
would
fare
ill
stick
to
buying
this
at
cheap
mexican
restaurants
where
the
only
other
option
is
corona
drinkability
i
will
pass
on
this
one
ever
again
and
not
recomend
it
to
anyone
there
are
much
better
beers
for
the
price
so
its
dry
and
cripe
all
in
all
not
bad

its
middle
of
the
road
stuff
and
when
better
options
are
available
on
tap
it
lags
behind
this
is
a
rather
watery
international
lager
that
still
is
more
flavorful
than
bud
or
canadian
its
pretty
refreshing
in
the
heat
on
the
beach
but
doesnt
have
much
flavor
or
complexity
to
offer
hmm
i
sit
here
not
hating
this
beer
cause
im
thirsty
and
tired
but
in
reality
this
is
a
fairly
watery
lager
that
has
little
real
character
the
nose
is
ciderlike
a
sign
of
age
but
the
taste
is
still
ok
hints
of
corn
but
not
too
sweet
in
the
finish
make
this
ok
fresh
in
a
mexican
bar
but
not
worth
paying
import
prices
for
consuming
it
in
an
ideal
setting
undoubtedly
added
to
my
experience
which
was
enjoyable
so
im
edging
up
the
points
on
taste
and
drinkability
im
very
likely
to
drink
a
beer
like
this
in
a
similar
situation
in
the
future
and
im
not
going
to
penalize
a
brew
for
playing
to
its
strengths
drinkability
is
good
for
what
this
is
which
is
a
mexican
lager
nothing
really
special
about
it
but
it
isnt
off
putting
either
not
a
bad
lawnmower
brew
a
middle
of
the
road
lager
nothing
special
about
this
beer
i
dont
particularly
like
this
beer
it
is
clear
staw
colored
sparkly
fizz
it
does
have
some
sweeter
malty
smell
to
it
and
the
taste
is
malty
unbalanced
tinny
and
just
too
acidic
for
me
light
and
crisp
drinkable
only
because
it
is
light
and
isnt
so
bad
out
of
the
bottle
a
light
bodied
lager
well
suited
for
hot
weather
in
the
southern
climes
not
for
the
fall
season
in
mid
america
pours
a
full
gold
color
and
is
brilliantly
clear
it
is
well
carbonated
but
cant
really
manage
to
hold
more
than
a
wisp
of
a
pale
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
spicy
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
there
is
also
a
note
of
sweet
grain
the
beer
is
quite
thin
on
the
palate
and
other
than
a
little
bitterness
does
not
linger
at
all
the
taste
is
crisp
and
flavorless
up
front
but
manages
to
finish
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
sweet
thin
graininess
as
expected
there
is
not
much
to
this
beer
it
is
fairly
clean
except
for
the
sweet
grainy
character
really
not
much
to
say
about
this
like
most
of
the
lager
beers
its
blond
color
and
low
fermentation
without
abuse
of
hops
beach
favorite
beer
good
with
seafood
and
chinese
cuisine
smell
give
an
alcaline
sensation
smell
plane
soft
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
under
the
average
is
not
common
in
my
city
78
recommended
a
bit
watery
and
thin
on
malt
flavor
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
drinkable
nothing
to
get
exited
about
probably
good
with
tacos
i
found
this
to
be
sub
par
in
the
drinkability
realm
i
think
water
or
iced
tea
would
be
a
much
better
alternative
as
a
beer
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
this
one
again
ive
not
had
any
mexican
food
that
this
would
be
good
with
not
even
taco
bell
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
omaha
skip
it
worst
beer
in
mexico
ever
plus
the
light
ones
maybe
the
lager
concept
was
mistaken
by
light
because
this
beer
ahs
been
always
very
light
water
flavor
and
easy
to
get
spoiled
with
a
little
heat
over
it
some
amateur
drinkers
like
it
because
of
it
smootness
and
not
getting
drunk
so
easy
taste
is
much
less
grassy
and
much
more
sweet
fruity
malt
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
a
nice
crispness
to
finish
it
off
rinse
your
tongue
and
repeat
thin
and
fizzy
clean
finish
some
fruity
aftertaste
not
much
else
is
not
too
drinkable
for
a
pale
lager
not
bad
not
good
a
suitable
alternative
to
the
big
3
is
you
must
have
a
beer
somewhere
this
is
a
pretty
unimpressive
bland
macro
lager
very
similar
to
the
big
american
ones
i
cant
name
one
redeeming
quality
of
it
except
that
its
watered
down
and
easy
to
drink
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
bland
that
wont
fill
you
up
might
as
well
just
drink
a
bud
or
coors
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
gold
one
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
sticky
lacing
are
two
aspects
you
wont
find
in
many
other
macros
however
the
european
influence
on
mexican
beer
is
heavily
percieved
in
the
taste
and
smell
skunky
hops
and
spicy
grain
dominate
while
lending
a
dry
bittness
and
smooth
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
with
a
clean
finish
not
very
different
but
certainly
better
than
the
average
macro
or
euro
lager
drinkability
the
best
mexican
lager
available
up
here
in
canada
overallsimply
unremarkable
i
feel
like
ive
tasted
this
beer
a
thousand
times
and
i
have
because
it
is
just
like
any
bmc
product
dissapointing
especially
compared
to
the
decent
vienna
amber
overall
its
acceptable
if
this
is
what
your
looking
for
but
the
amber
is
a
much
better
choice
on
a
whim
i
recently
tried
a
bottle
of
dos
equis
with
a
meal
ive
got
to
say
i
didnt
realize
what
id
been
missing
by
always
picking
a
craft
brew
or
lesserknown
beer
instead
of
dos
equis
during
all
those
trips
to
beer
stores
the
only
real
real
disappointment
in
this
beer
was
the
smell
perhaps
its
allergy
season
kicking
in
but
i
had
real
trouble
drawing
any
distinct
aroma
from
either
the
brew
or
the
empty
bottle
usually
the
bottle
will
provide
aroma
even
when
the
beer
hasnt
appearance
seemed
like
the
hohum
average
for
crystaline
lagers
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
also
werent
worthy
of
top
marks
in
my
book
but
they
did
make
the
beer
more
appealing
than
the
lack
of
smell
might
suggest
starts
a
gentle
almost
sweet
flavor
and
settles
onto
the
tongue
with
a
lightbodied
yet
complex
palatte
hop
wheat
and
oat
undertones
finishes
as
it
begins
and
i
was
glad
to
find
out
that
it
left
without
the
least
hint
of
bitter
or
sour
afterthoughts
no
part
of
this
beer
stays
on
the
tongue
after
the
brew
has
been
consumed
id
say
this
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
to
start
out
the
night
as
you
could
head
right
into
your
next
bottle
without
fear
that
itll
taste
like
dos
equis
nice
color
no
head
nor
lace
barely
a
smell
lightly
hoppy
watery
bubbly
if
you
know
your
beers
youll
hardly
want
another
one
thin
mouthfeel
with
the
only
saving
grace
that
the
beer
has
some
excellent
active
carbonation
this
is
another
why
bother
beer
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
should
have
a
got
a
margarita
instead
final
thought
like
some
other
mexican
beers
corona
not
included
this
just
seems
better
when
consumed
in
the
right
setting
namely
mexico
pours
a
light
color
with
not
much
head
and
zip
lacing
smells
like
a
typical
lager
malt
malt
malt
however
it
tastes
really
good
great
carbonation
level
nice
malt
taste
and
goes
down
easy
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
when
low
on
cash
my
1
beer
in
mexico
so
far
drinkability
if
youre
at
a
mexican
restaurant
havent
tried
dos
equis
and
are
really
thirsty
order
a
few
but
if
any
of
the
above
terms
dont
apply
then
id
probably
skip
this
one
nothing
to
get
excited
about
pours
a
clear
typical
adjunct
lager
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
goes
away
quicky
smells
like
your
normal
skunky
green
bottle
beer
with
hints
of
grain
and
corn
tastes
again
like
an
average
lager
malts
and
hops
are
very
very
minimal
also
has
the
thinnest
taste
of
corn
much
more
carbonated
than
it
looks
feels
like
an
mbc
beer
in
the
mouth
this
would
be
a
completely
average
session
beer
if
nothing
else
is
around
all
in
all
its
better
than
corona
and
your
typical
mexican
beers
but
not
by
much
a
good
beer
to
have
when
trying
a
couple
of
different
dos
equis
varieties
for
comparison
but
definately
not
one
to
go
back
to
this
isnt
the
beer
for
that
i
have
tried
this
at
mexican
restaruants
and
it
complements
spicy
food
salsa
and
chips
magnificently
by
itself
it
kinda
sucks
though
an
average
lager
i
tend
to
go
with
this
in
mexican
restaurants
because
about
as
decent
as
mexican
lagers
get
pours
a
lazy
yellow
with
a
little
lace
head
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
hints
of
sugared
malt
slight
skunk
the
taste
is
of
a
nice
breaded
grain
mixed
with
a
smooth
crisp
malt
that
cleanses
the
palate
light
bodied
and
a
good
lawnmower
beer
its
an
unimpressive
straw
color
that
is
really
not
much
different
than
typical
american
lagers
it
has
a
bold
bitter
taste
that
is
killed
completely
by
the
lime
wedges
that
rude
waiters
will
put
in
it
unless
you
specifically
tell
them
not
to
oelergud
this
is
definently
a
better
brew
than
the
majority
of
the
mexican
lagers
ive
had
appearance
is
golden
fairly
bright
but
head
is
quite
weak
with
almost
no
retention
smell
is
standard
luckily
not
skunked
slightly
sweet
not
powerful
at
all
taste
is
fairly
average
which
is
quite
good
for
a
mexican
beer
hops
bite
is
minimal
beer
tastes
mainly
of
average
malty
sweetness
taste
ends
up
equalling
a
nice
middleoftheroad
lager
dos
equis
special
lager
is
a
nice
easydrinkin
beer
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
with
mexican
food
or
in
a
weekend
session
the
beer
poured
a
yellow
color
and
i
thought
to
myself
it
looks
like
bud
the
smell
however
is
a
bit
more
appealing
than
buds
the
taste
is
better
i
enjoyed
the
mild
sweet
graniness
of
the
flavor
the
slight
hops
and
malt
seemed
to
balance
each
other
nicely
this
beer
is
more
fullbodied
than
tecate
sol
or
superior
but
that
is
not
saying
much
i
cannot
picture
myself
ordering
this
beer
in
an
american
bar
but
in
mexico
it
taste
nice
pale
crystal
clear
appearance
this
beer
has
the
tone
of
white
grapefruit
juice
maybe
just
a
little
darker
no
head
a
slight
dirty
white
collar
appearance
is
lacking
light
grainy
malts
and
hay
on
the
nose
maybe
a
titch
of
floral
hop
aroma
mouthfeel
is
more
carbonated
than
it
looks
malts
are
grainy
and
corny
on
the
buds
just
a
little
bit
of
an
astringent
bitterness
a
little
metallic
character
comes
into
play
in
the
aftertaste
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
ive
had
worse
i
picked
thisone
on
tap
at
a
poolside
bar
for
ive
had
the
amber
but
not
the
lager
it
came
with
a
lime
in
it
that
im
sure
put
a
citric
spin
on
the
taste
and
flattened
the
appearance
that
said
it
was
a
well
carbonated
gold
that
had
a
white
head
that
sorta
fizzed
to
nothing
very
little
lace
spots
could
be
seen
the
aroma
of
corn
grain
greet
you
as
the
same
taste
follows
the
taste
also
had
a
metallic
hint
to
it
as
well
an
ok
lager
on
a
hot
day
by
the
pool
esp
when
its
the
only
off
macro
offered
though
loose
the
lime
quickly
the
dos
equis
poured
a
very
light
clear
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
that
was
very
quickly
completely
gone
it
has
a
skunky
yet
slightly
floral
nose
its
very
thin
and
watery
there
is
very
little
flavor
just
a
sweetish
starch
and
some
slight
skunkiness
overall
its
a
little
better
than
some
macros
but
not
by
much
ve4ry
refreshing
beer
and
it
does
taste
better
than
corona
as
a
matter
afact
it
dosnt
need
a
lime
it
does
have
a
little
corny
taste
to
it
but
it
has
more
subsatnce
and
body
than
corona
thats
why
its
better
evn
though
im
not
saying
i
would
buy
this
beer
i
wouldnt
ever
this
was
horrific
corn
and
adjcunts
aplenty
watery
mouthfeel
typical
mexican
yellow
as
piss
lager
some
plastic
flavours
pop
up
every
now
and
then
luckily
i
had
the
footy
to
watch
to
distract
me
from
the
weak
as
piss
mexican
lager
this
is
easily
just
as
bad
as
corona
beats
corona
for
washing
down
mexican
food
as
far
as
mexican
brews
go
this
is
one
that
is
on
the
edge
of
being
something
really
good
it
porued
a
medium
golden
color
with
minimal
head
that
subsided
quickly
the
smell
was
grainy
but
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
there
the
taste
was
almost
pure
eurolager
skunk
but
it
was
saved
by
a
nice
dry
aftertaste
the
caught
me
by
suprise
this
is
much
better
than
corona
and
pacifico
but
there
must
be
better
mexican
brews
out
there
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
spotty
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
its
typical
lager
scent
all
the
way
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
sweet
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
light
with
a
simple
pale
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
dry
finish
and
that
mexican
lager
zing
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
it
drinks
average
this
is
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
nothing
special
this
was
sampled
at
hotel
nelson
in
tijuana
with
some
excellent
nachos
and
some
wonderful
mexican
dinners
this
was
poured
into
a
foam
cup
as
we
were
sitting
outside
and
suprisingly
the
cup
did
not
impart
any
off
flavors
in
this
beer
the
aromas
are
all
light
hops
and
malts
and
the
taste
follows
suit
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
has
more
oomph
than
a
corona
or
sol
and
the
drinkability
is
great
overall
this
isnt
terrible
if
youre
pairing
it
up
with
something
like
chips
and
salsa
or
a
spicey
dish
by
itself
dos
equis
special
lager
is
pretty
bland
and
uninspired
the
head
was
small
and
irregular
but
the
lacing
wasnt
too
bad
except
for
a
slightly
skunky
pungency
the
aroma
of
dos
equis
was
similar
to
most
other
mass
produced
lagers
sweet
corn
mingled
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
thought
i
could
detect
a
minute
suggestion
of
citrus
balanced
in
a
very
small
dose
mind
you
with
a
very
small
hint
of
honey
average
the
taste
was
bland
watery
and
pretty
much
tasteless
on
the
palate
dos
equis
was
thin
and
didnt
feature
much
of
an
aftertaste
very
dull
and
unexciting
stuff
22
oz
bottle
i
was
prepared
to
dislike
it
green
bottle
of
overhyped
import
purchased
from
drug
store
cooler
with
flourescent
lights
etc
but
this
just
didnt
suck
the
way
i
thought
it
is
kind
of
plain
with
a
standard
beery
smell
not
a
lot
of
flavor
and
perhaps
filled
with
adjuncts
still
nothing
really
offensive
mostly
what
youd
expect
in
this
style
and
probably
a
better
choice
in
most
mexican
restaurants
just
why
do
socalled
mexican
beers
try
to
taste
just
like
american
ones
dont
see
what
the
special
part
of
this
lager
is
this
lager
will
serve
to
quench
your
thirst
but
will
not
make
you
wish
for
another
based
upon
the
taste
it
pours
to
a
decent
head
with
a
fair
color
the
nose
leaves
lots
to
be
desired
no
rush
of
malts
or
hops
the
beer
fills
your
mouth
but
nothing
stands
out
and
the
finish
consists
of
some
decent
lager
crispness
but
it
is
very
shortlived
went
down
alright
with
my
quesadillas
but
considering
im
paying
top
shelf
price
for
it
i
can
surely
do
better
especially
when
its
not
a
whole
lot
better
than
local
swill
i
spose
at
least
the
flavor
wasnt
offensive
but
still
dull
as
dishwater
hundreds
of
tiny
bubbles
streaming
through
its
crystalclear
yellowgold
body
support
a
creamy
white
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
craggy
and
spotty
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
generic
beer
with
a
distinct
note
of
dimethyl
sulfite
and
some
mild
skunkiness
remaining
from
what
little
hops
were
there
to
begin
with
its
lightly
crisp
and
then
somewhat
creamy
in
the
mouth
as
it
warms
across
the
palate
the
flavor
delivers
all
that
might
be
expected
which
is
little
its
sweetish
adjunctladen
and
dms
laced
malt
is
held
in
check
by
a
sublime
bitterness
and
it
finishes
short
and
dry
with
a
light
note
of
refreshing
hop
spice
and
some
short
lingering
malt
sugar
basically
i
would
consider
this
an
upper
class
of
corona
i
didnt
like
the
taste
at
first
but
after
a
few
minutes
i
actually
began
to
enjoy
it
it
seems
as
if
it
tasted
a
little
strong
at
first
but
then
the
more
and
more
i
drank
it
it
seemed
to
diminish
in
strength
a
decent
imported
mexican
beer
i
recommend
it
over
corona
for
those
summer
time
parties
it
is
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
with
the
exception
of
casta
which
isnt
even
in
the
same
class
pours
a
boring
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
nothing
much
in
the
aroma
smells
like
a
mass
produced
beer
slightly
bitter
taste
and
drinkable
with
a
lime
ive
had
this
beer
when
it
tasted
really
good
and
other
times
ive
had
it
and
not
liked
it
at
all
so
im
not
sure
what
to
say
to
conclude
its
not
bad
at
all
for
a
massproduction
beer
but
its
still
nothing
special
drinkability

its
made
to

typical
mexican
party
beeer
when
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
glass
the
head
quickly
dissolved
and
there
were
small
bubbles
with
this
beer
this
beer
was
watery
and
did
not
have
much
taste
to
it
in
my
opinion
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
yellow
it
had
an
aftertaste
to
it
which
i
did
not
like
and
there
is
not
much
character
to
this
beer
crispclear
light

no

this
one
with
maltiness
a
bit
sweet
and
not
at
all
dry
could
this
possibly
be
allbarley
brewed
doubt
it
taste
is
just
there
and
barely
worth
remembering
not
for
me
in
or
out
of
the
sun
and
wouldnt
give
dos
pesos
to
take
one
home
when
i
drank
this
i
found
myself
comparing
this
to
rolling
rock
only
with
dos
equis
having
a
fuller
body
and
flavor
the
offflavors
in
rock
are
a
bit
similar
to
this
altogether
this
is
a
somewhat
decent
beer
that
would
pair
up
well
with
mexican
food
but
the
taste
seems
a
bit
too
corny
for
my
liking
drinkabilitynotes
one
of
the
better
macro
brews
from
mexico
one
could
do
far
worse
dos
xx
goes
well
with
mexican
food
and
it
can
be
found
any
mexican
restaurant
in
texas
thats
worth
its
salt
very
refreshing
in
hot
summer
weather
pours
a
decent
enough
golden
color
that
is
clear
with
a
thin
short
lived
head
the
nose
is
very
sweet
malt
and
mid
level
hops
that
are
crisp
the
flavor
is
also
quite
sweet
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
that
adds
more
of
a
spicey
falvor
than
a
hoppy
one
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
soft
not
heavy
carbonation
the
finish
is
fair
as
well
with
a
sweet
and
bitter
blend
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
the
only
beer
out
my
mexican
sampling
that
had
any
hop
presence
even
though
here
it
is
still
weak
color
is
golden
pale
yellow
trying
hard
to
be
dark
head
was
white
just
hovering
over
14
inch
high
some
bubble
lace
smells
faintly
of
sweet
spiced
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
just
a
bit
more
boldness
and
sharpness
in
the
flavor
department
mostly
sweet
malt
thats
got
a
slight
spice
to
it
and
has
slight
noticeable
hop
nearing
the
back
feel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
crisp
and
clean
a
bit
sharper
then
the
others
easy
drinker
and
bit
more
to
it
then
just
water
like
its
darker
stablemate
amber
lager
this
a
good
beer
if
not
a
top
beer
for
lagers
it
is
on
target
and
is
relatively
true
to
the
pale
lager
style
the
mid
yellow
coloring
is
good
if
not
strong
but
the
head
is
thin
and
quickly
gone
very
little
lacing
a
grain
sense
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
this
is
not
a
disappointing
brew
but
it
offers
only
a
limited
set
of
reasons
to
choose
it
over
others
a
good
beer
where
better
choices
cannot
be
found
a
decent

taste
better
than
corona
pours
a
gold
color
with
little
or
no

this
like
corona
is
good
on
a
hot
mexican
summer
day
ive
had
this
both
here
and
in
mexico
and
it
did
taste
better
in
mexico
but
one
thing
either
here
or
there
its
watery
there
is
very
little
carbonation
goes
down
just
like
water
amber
is
better
more
flavor
drinkability
notes
for
what
it
is
worth
this
is
better
than
corona
other
than
that
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
it
comes
around
the
mexican
restaurant
i
usually
go
to
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
i
had
never
tried
it
on
tap
before
the
beer
poured
clear
and
had
a
good
head
which
lasted
for
quite
awhile
the
aroma
was
not
much
no
malt
nor
hops
the
flavor
was
quite
subdued
its
coldness
and
refreshing
quality
made
a
good
companion
for
a
great
tamale
dinner
for
a
dinner
drink
it
is
great
it
would
make
a
great
summer
cooler
not
as
good
as
the
amber
but
still
worth
a
try
had
kind
of
a
malty
taste
but
not
too
malty
i
like
the
logo
pretty
original
not
as
cool
as
sol
logo
but
still
cool
finished
smooth
a
little
watery
but
not
too
bad
i
like
it
with
mexican
food
or
on
a
hot
summer
day
clearish
straw
color
with
a
better
head
than
some
and
lacks
adjunct
qualities
a
bit
of
skunk
smell
some
sense
of
a
weak
hay
malt
is
decent
some
estery
sense
and
elements
of
subdued
nutiness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
attenuates
into
a
dryishness
late
some
senses
of
raw
grain
and
corn
syrup
this
brew
is
fairly
mediocre
overall
but
has
more
malt
goodness
than
many
others
from
south
of
the
border
a
rarity
in
that
its
a
lager
with
some
character
nothing
amazing
but
the
clearly
the
best
mexican
pils
it
has
a
decent
amber
color
and
medium
and
lively
body
basic
but
attractive
malt
aroma
and
lovely
balanced
acidity
the
pour
a
limpid
golden
straw
color
the
head
masterful
and
bright
white
the
lace
in
fine
sheets
to
coat
the
glass
malt
makes
up
the
nose
with
a
nice
lightly
sweet
front
and
the
top
skinny
finish
is
perkily
acidic
the
hops
adequate
and
the
aftertaste
dry
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
and
flavor
are
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
very
crisp
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
a
big
plate
of
spicy
texmex
cries
out
for
screw
corona
this
is
the
mexican
beer
good
amber
color
light
head
light
yet
a
good
body
the
only
beer
to
drink
with
mexican
food
very
thirst
quenching
so
you
can
eat
as
many
peppers
as
you
like
good
head
doesnt
linger
but
there
is
a
head
nice
rich
copper
color
i
cant
exactly
spot
the
aroma
but
there
are
hints
of
bannana
and
other
tropical
things
semisweet
flavor
but
does
not
reflect
exactly
the
aroma
makes
the
mind
think
that
you
are
in
mexico
good
finish
but
must
have
a
lime
to
balance
it
out
nice
fine
head
good
rich
color
smells
like
green
bananas
toasted
corn
flour
and
corn
syrup
a
little
exotic
in
a
way
but
over
sweet
by
far
the
flavors
are
much
more
dilute
than
the
aromas
suggest
with
repetition
of
the
toasted
corn
theme
dry
and
lightning
quick
finish
leaving
a
parched
grainy
bitterness
one
to
avoid
i
remember
a
college
buddy
raving
about
this
beer
i
dont
think
id
had
it
in
about
8
or
9
years
when
i
bought
this
six
pack
in
conclusion
its
nothing
worth
raving
about
but
its
not
terrible
either
on
the
whole
dos
equis
is
better
than
the
typical
macro
mediumdark
straw
color
with
negligible
head
cereal
grains
grassiness
and
a
little
dms
are
some
minor
distracting
flaws
nice
clean
hop
finish
has
a
little
more
character
than
i
expected
just
your
average
lager
with
a
different
twist
a
cross
breed
between
euro
lager
and
american
adjunct
not
really
bad
but
not
really
exciting
enough
to
wax
poetic
the
graininess
in
the
taste
and
aroma
may
turn
people
off
but
with
some
spicy
hot
mexican
food
whos
gonna
know
the
difference
actually
its
pretty
bold
for
a
lager
and
should
be
drank
with
food
that
is
just
as
bold
no
where
near
as
good
as
the
amber
the
flavor
was
there
and
then
gone
instantly
reminding
me
of
a
nonalcoholic
beer
not
worth
mentioning
any
other
characteristics
except
for
the
lack
of
flavor
2
5s
across
the
board
on
this
one
a
very
average
pils
i
guess
its
appearance
at
every
mexican
restaurant
makes
it
better
than
other
bland
offerings
face
it
when
you
pair
it
with
spicy
food
its
not
that
bad
special
lager
no
to
me
all
i
kept
hearing
was
better
than
corona
as
far
as
mexican
beers
go
i
dont
think
so
this
had
a
really
funny
taste
to
it
it
was
not
too
bad
but
when
i
think
special
i
think
of
that
excellent
brew
that
just
leaves
a
big
smile
on
your
face
and
some
naked
women
on
your
lap
they
are
drinkable
but
not
enjoyable
dark
straw
light
golden
in
hue
and
typically
clear
the
head
settles
into
a
moderate
layer
that
persists
well
enough
to
leave
lace
the
overall
malt
aroma
is
very
mild
and
consists
of
light
grainy
notes
and
just
a
hint
of
cooked
corn
dimethyl
sulfide
hop
nose
is
absent
its
clean
but
unenticing
aroma
wise
the
overall
flavor
is
balanced
but
bland
the
mild
hop
bitterness
is
balanced
by
both
residual
malt
and
adjunct
corn
sweetness
malt
complexity
is
lacking
due
to
the
adjuncts
in
the
grist
only
a
light
husky
flavor
from
the
basemalt
contributes
flavor
hop
flavor
is
virtually
absent
the
finish
is
clean
dry
and
leaves
much
to
be
desired
special
lager
is
reminiscent
of
a
domestic
macrobrew
w
more
flavor
its
definitely
not
a
beer
to
be
appreciated
by
itself
this
one
is
runnerup
to
bohemia
for
mexican
beers
in
my
opinion
its
actually
got
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
and
lacks
the
stickysweetness
of
some
other
mexican
lagers
it
goes
well
with
the
likes
of
carnitas
and
chile
relleno
this
is
another
one
of
those
beers
that
i
used
to
enjoy
before
my
pallate
evolved
the
amber
color
of
the
brew
had
me
feeling
hopeful
but
the
flavor
was
exceedingly
thin
a
little
hop
a
little
sweet
but
mostly
not
much
it
was
a
fine
beer
to
match
up
with
the
barbecue
i
was
having
that
night
but
thats
about
all
i
can
say
positive
for
it
you
really
gotta
be
desperate
to
drink
alot
of
this
dos
equis
is
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
big
malty
molasses
flavor
and
a
hop
finish
this
beer
stays
reasonably
dry
throughout
corny
rice
filler
aftertaste
makes
this
brew
a
one
time
experience
only
for
me
good
continentalstyle
lager
goes
well
with
mexican
dishes
or
any
other
spicy
food
good
beer
if
you
can
get
it
for
a
decent
price
comes
in
green
bottles
so
beware
the
skunks
this
beer
was
a
surprise
im
not
really
big
on
the
light
colored
beers
i
usually
only
drink
them
when
the
goal
is
getting
drunk
dos
equis
is
similar
to
corona
in
flavor
color
and
most
of
the
other
factors
but
its
just
better
tasting
and
a
darker
fuller
color
squeeze
in
a
little
lime
or
not
its
just
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
a
meal
especially
if
youre
eating
mexican
a
mexican
take
on
heineken
fairly
clean
with
some
mild
corn
influence
but
not
much
going
on
here
notes
europeangerman
brewing
influences
are
apparent
with
this
brew
its
not
your
typical
mexican
lagerpils
and
even
though
its
essentially
a
mediocre
beer
its
not
an
entirely
bad
beer
pairs
nicely
with
mexican
food
or
a
nice
alternative
to
american
lagers
as
it
has
a
bit
more
body
and
flavour
not
much
going
here
weak
on
smell
taste
and
body
taste
is
light
grain
and
wheat
with
a
touch
of
lemon
i
would
never
rush
out
and
purchase
this
beer
as
it
is
slightly
above
its
competitors
in
the
adjunct
lager
style
that
said
i
think
this
is
infinitely
more
drinkable
than
corona
and
several
other
caribbean
adjunct
lagers
if
i
was
not
rating
to
style
this
would
come
closer
to
a
2
nothing
special
decent
light
beer
though
for
those
summer
session
drinking
days
prefer
this
beer
over
a
corona
any
day
beer
hunt
said
the
abv
is
1
4
anyway
very
sour
cerveza
plain
taste
smell
of
corn
better
option
than
corona
if
your
in
mexico
overall
maybe
this
might
pair
well
with
mexican
food
but
i
probably
wont
try
it
again
there
are
to
many
other
mexican
beers
that
go
well
with
food
just
another
beer
from
the
south
flavor
like
corona
pacifico
etc
very
light
beer
with
dominant
skunky
notes
in
the
aroma
i
hate
it
i
ordered
sol
directly
after
the
modelo
especial
so
this
lager
tasted
like
a
watered
down
miller
lite
yes
you
heard
me
correctly
watered
down
and
thats
saying
something
given
how
watered
down
miller
lite
is
there
was
no
body
or
carbonation
to
speak
of
and
the
taste
was
well
there
wasnt
much
taste
i
learned
my
lesson
here
i
will
not
be
revisiting
this
one
a
very
light
tasting
mexican
beer
i
squeeze
a
wedge
of
lime
in
to
it
my
days
of
strong
tasting
beer
are
few
and
far
between
good
alternative
to
dos
xxx
this
beer
is
downright
enjoyable
when
it
is
ice
cold
and
you
are
on
the
beach
in
mexico
any
other
time
i
would
take
a
pass
regardless
of
the
qualities
of
this
brew
ill
never
turn
down
a
sol
overall
this
is
a
lawnmower
beer
nothing
more
i
would
not
willingly
seek
this
out
again
unless
there
were
no
other
options
available
better
tasting
than
i
expected
nothing
to
look
at
more
like
yellow
water
no
smell
but
for
some
reason
that
was
not
a
bad
thing
feel
is
watery
but
overall
i
did
not
mind
drinking
it
of
the
three
beers
we
had
at
our
resort
dos
equis
corona
light
and
sol
i
definitely
enjoyed
sol
the
most
excellent
for
poolocean
side
drinking
especially
with
a
lime
this
is
not
any
different
than
corona
maybe
even
worse
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
f
no
even
if
a
friend
give
it
to
u
for
your
birthday
but
that
directly
im
the
garbage
dosent
even
satisfy
that
rare
urge
for
a
cheap
mexican
beer
just
plain
bad
no
redeeming
factors
for
me
mexican
shit
south
of
the
border
high
life
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
tastes
better
then
corona
i
once
saw
this
listed
as
the
best
mexican
beer
you
can
buy
wonder
what
they
were
smoking
lol
i
just
sampled
a
great
many
beers
in
mexico
most
mediocre
at
best
although
i
will
endeavor
to
provide
a
focus
on
any
differences
i
was
able
to
discern
and
will
also
attempt
some
degree
of
objectivity
this
one
is
actually
harder
to
find
than
corona
and
pacifico
at
least
in
cabo
san
lucas
and
surrounding
area
finally
snagged
one
at
an
american
burger
joint
a
pale
yellow
maybe
just
a
hair
darker
than
corona
with
obvious
effervescent
fizz
but
no
true
head
of
which
to
speak
aroma
is
the
expected
meld
of
creamed
corn
skunk
rank
grass
and
ever
so
subtle
citrus
fruit
notes
little
in
the
way
of
aroma
per
se
though
again
just
a
hair
more
flavor
than
corona
but
a
near
clone
thereof
less
corn
and
perhaps
more
of
a
citrus
and
grape
candy
note
in
other
words
slightly
more
mainstream
lager
character
does
not
improve
as
it
warms
needless
to
say
nil
hop
aroma
or
flavor
but
plenty
of
skunk
in
this
here
example
far
too
fizzy
which
serves
to
mask
the
few
flavor
elements
present
not
great
not
worth
a
serious
tasting
session
not
the
worst
mexican
aal
ive
tasted
but
pretty
bad
even
with
a
lime
in
it
yea
not
the
worst
ive
had
requires
a
lime
to
enjoy
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
again
smells
like
piss
better
than
corrona
this
mexican
beer
poured
nicely
with
a
clear
yellow
color
1
finger
head
and
decent
lacing
looked
pretty
good
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
a
back
road
along
a
farm
that
had
recently
been
fertilized
add
to
that
a
dead
skunk
and
it
sums
it
up
nicely
the
taste
this
is
just
one
nasty
beer
lets
put
it
this
way
an
ice
cold
rolling
rock
is
a
glorious
thing
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
piss
warm
rolling
rock
is
well
like
piss
this
beer
even
served
ice
cold
makes
me
prefer
a
warm
rolling
rock
it
was
actually
difficult
to
finish
a
drain
pourer
for
sure
and
not
worthy
of
even
beer
batter
for
frying
4
5abv
edit
upon
review
of
other
writeups
from
baers
perhaps
sol
changed
their
formula
and
its
now
great
my
sample
had
a
great
head
with
rings
of
lacing
good
crisp
flavor
and
no
skunk
hm
sol
brewed
by
cervecería
cuauhtémoc
moctezuma
s
a
de
c
v
with
an
abv
of
4
5
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
rich
grains
and
corn
there
is
some
skunkiness
to
this
brew
the
skunkness
is
not
to
overpowering
in
this
brew
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
grains
this
brew
has
a
light
body
to
it
there
is
not
a
lot
to
this
brew
but
it
is
good
sol
goes
down
smooth
with
no
bad
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
overall
im
giving
this
brew
4
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
im
reviewing
the
bottle
version
of
this
brew
but
it
is
better
in
a
can
if
you
are
going
to
get
this
brew
get
in
a
can
looks
like
a
soda
and
corn
barley
slightly
bitter
fill
your
belly
but
does
not
cause
anything
but
taste
is
taste
surprisingly
the
aftertaste
is
not
an
overwhelmingly
bitter
or
metallicrocky
taste
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
tastes
like
a
slightly
improved
corona
it
has
very
little
merit
no
character
little
or
no
flavour
rather
sweet
but
there
is
nothing
bad
about
it
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
buy
it
but
its
okay
i
expected
a
lot
worse
overall
nothing
outstanding
but
not
offensive
either
should
pair
well
with
spicy
food
great
taste
attractive
design
one
of
oldest
mexican
beer
full
of
history
and
tradition
from
german
founders
full
of
tsar
and
refreshing
most
of
people
in
usa
like
to
introduce
a
lime
in
the
bottle
not
necessary
at
all
perfect
companion
for
beef
strongly
recommended
final
grade

a
c
sol
is
one
of
the
better
imported
cervezas
i
have
tried
but
believe
me
when
i
say
that
this
is
far
from
a
ringing
endorsement
it
is
fairly
bland
and
corn
sodalike
with
no
especially
offensive
attributes
this
ones
main
attraction
is
the
relatively
low
price
but
there
are
domestic
corona
knockoffs
that
manage
to
beat
it
in
that
department
in
hot
weather
this
beer
will
refresh
you
but
i
can
think
of
plenty
of
other
lagers
id
rather
be
drinking
to
be
fair
corona
is
not
one
of
them
so
you
could
certainly
do
worse
sol
is
a
decent
beer
i
have
had
it
a
few
times
i
enjoyed
it
every
time
that
i
have
had
it
it
has
a
champaign
look
to
it
as
well
the
taste
is
not
that
bad
it
goes
down
smooth
and
it
does
not
make
you
feel
full
like
some
beers
make
you
feel
if
you
have
never
tried
this
beer
you
should
at
least
try
it
once
o
decent
thirst
quencher
but
lacking
in
flavor
omeh
reminds
me
of
beer
i
stole
from
grandpas
fridge
as
a
kid
that
came
in
a
plain
white
can
with
the
word
beer
written
in
black
on
the
side
its
pretty
close
to
drinking
water
while
i
do
tend
to
like
the
darker
beers
i
didnt
think
this
one
was
too
bad
scent
is
not
too
great
taste
is
mildly
bitter
but
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
background
not
too
deep
of
a
flavor
reminds
me
of
other
mexican
beers
not
too
serious
good
cold
after
a
dip
in
the
pool
maybe
with
a
lime
pours
a
clear
gold
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
corn
hint
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
hint
of
hops
and
rice
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
fits
the
style
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
tastes
of
strong
adjunct
hint
of
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
hop
overall
not
much
to
report
almost
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
taste
is
more
corn
and
adjuncts
body
is
very
light
even
watery
beer
flavored
water

that
it

i

am

i

i

its

will
i

yes
i
will
here
are
my
five
words
o
hey
i
kinda
like
it
sure
its
an
adjunct
lager
that
ultimately
can
be
beaten
by
any
craft
beer
out
there
but
for
what
it
is
its
alright
nothing
special
generic
lager
taste
horrible
very
disappointing
i
wanted
to
like
based
on
its
history
in
the
culture
not
a
very
good
beer
fosters
because
why
not
its
australian
for
bored
saw
the
oil
can
at
the
local
publix
and
couldnt
help
but
remember
how
i
used
to
think
this
was
a
premium
beer
lol
pours
from
the
obnoxiously
large
can
in
to
a
modelo
pint
glass
with
gusto
the
massive
loose
head
of
fizzy
white
crackling
suds
is
as
big
as
the
can
it
rests
atop
a
pale
yellow
lager
with
copious
amounts
of
bubbles
hugging
the
glass
before
disappearing
in
record
time
whats
left
is
an
uninspired
pint
of
pale
lifeless
liquid
about
as
transparent
as
a
beer
can
be
a
slightly
sulfurous
smell
melds
with
metallic
accents
and
a
subtle
sour
floral
hop
note
in
a
nutshell
cheap
lager
the
taste
is
dominated
by
malty
corn
sweetness
with
scant
balancing
bitterness
but
not
a
sugary
sweetness
like
chewing
on
unpopped
popcorn
kernels
with
a
hint
of
aspartame
the
finish
is
relatively
crisp
and
clean
with
little
residual
flavor
surprisingly
mild
carbonation
with
a
smooth
slick
and
easy
mouthfeel
i
could
easily
shotgun
this
entire
oil
can
with
little
effort
almost
like
beerflavored
water
overall
aside
from
the
unappealing
aroma
this
is
your
typical
pale
fizzy
swill
from
time
to
time
its
just
the
right
change
of
pace
surprised
i
said
that
its
an
adjunct
lager
for
the
style
its
not
half
bad
if
i
was
selfmedicating
id
probably
choose
a
beer
like
this
as
an
angloaustralian
i
like
this
beer
i
like
to
drink
the
local
brew
in
most
places
i
travel
to
but
this
one
is
above
average
the
oversize
cans
appeal
to
the
english
and
scottish
lager
louts
perhaps
giving
the
beer
a
worse
name
than
it
deserves
better
than
water
or
rainier
overall
skip
this
beer
an
adjunct
lager
does
not
mean
the
beer
has
to
be
flavorless
which
this
is
i
recommend
passing
on
it
i
would
sometimes
buy
these
in
the
oil
cans
just
because
they
looked
cool
but
not
great
ok
beer
nothing
special
very
crappy
beer
really
only
bought
this
beer
for
the
can
for
my
collection
i
had
heard
nothing
but
negative
things
about
it
i
was
not
disappointed
it
was
bad
a
standard
lager
with
nothing
special
to
offer
but
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
and
fun
to
drink
out
of
a
massive
can
i
dont
understand
why
i
drank
this
overall
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
seems
most
mass
beers
like
this
are
very
watery
and
have
almost
no
flavor
this
one
at
least
has
flavor
i
can
see
how
something
like
this
would
appeal
on
a
hot
day
it
goes
down
easy
and
at
least
to
me
is
a
bit
more
than
just
water
with
a
touch
of
beer
flavoring
o
this
used
to
be
a
splurgetype
beer
in
college
i
could
see
drinking
one
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
around
the
grill
but
it
doesnt
set
itself
apart
from
its
truly
cheap
domestic
counterparts
more
of
a
thirst
quencher
than
something
to
savor
i
think
my
rankings
are
off
because
the
system
detected
an
outlier
but
to
me
this
is
a
reasonable
aal
i
havent
drank
one
in
many
years
but
i
preferred
it
to
coors
lite
way
back
when
pours
a
straw
yellow
slightly
on
the
dark
side
compared
to
other
adjunct
beers
a
frothy
head
of
modest
size
ensues
the
lace
retention
not
so
much
the
smell
was
the
only
thing
that
really
bothered
me
it
had
a
graininess
to
it
that
didnt
feel
fresh
in
addition
there
was
an
odor
of
cooked
vegetables
that
was
not
so
pleasant
the
taste
surprised
me
however
a
smooth
and
clean
taste
that
was
malty
and
grainy
not
complex
at
all
but
not
so
watery
that
it
rendered
it
flavorless
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
beer
not
my
favorite
but
not
as
bad
for
me
at
least
as
its
portrayed
here
had
in
the
oil
can
tailgating
for
a
football
game
in
november
sorry
for
late
upload
very
unimpressive
for
the
aal
category
there
are
so
many
cheaper
domestic
aal
beers
that
are
so
much
better
had
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
just
after
christmas
2014
selected
this
beer
as
it
was
the
best
option
of
the
beers
available
at
the
party
we
attended
tolerable
at
first
because
it
was
cold
worsened
as
it
warmed
as
the
corn
flavor
started
to
emerge
wouldnt
pay
money
for
his
stuff
i
had
this
ice
cold
on
tap
at
outback
steakhouse
on
new
years
eve
in
the
light
of
the
restaurant
the
brew
looked
pretty
good
a
nice
golden
hue
with
delicate
carbonation
and
a
puffy
white
head
there
was
minimal
lacing
smell
is
of
whet
and
some
slight
malt
taste
was
well
actually
upon
first
tasting
it
i
thought
it
was
pretty
awful
stuff
not
much
subtlety
and
too
much
malt
but
upon
taking
a
few
more
tastes
i
consider
fosters
to
be
an
acceptable
tasting
lager
it
beats
the
budweisers
and
millers
or
the
world
but
not
by
too
much
it
has
a
light
body
and
good
carbonation
on
the
tongue
it
certainly
gets
the
job
done
and
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
but
again
i
had
it
on
tap
its
probably
better
that
way
what
beer
isnt
pretty
terrible
its
kind
of
amazing
how
bad
fosters
actually
tastes

b
funny
when
younger
i
thought
this
was
a
premium
beer
still
ok
but
only
ice
cold
ill
get
one
with
a
steak
at
good
ole
outback
steakhouse
now
and
then
overall
i
actually
quite
like
fosters
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
absolutely
hit
the
spot
when
it
is
hot
outside
and
has
just
enough
to
be
a
bit
different
to
the
standard
aussie
macro
lager
decent
too
for
around
au46
a
case
australian
for
not
good
fosters
australian
for
piss
they
foist
this
swill
off
on
tourists
while
they
chug
the
good
stuff
themselves
dont
let
the
commercials
fool
you
stay
far
far
away
overall
a
pretty
straight
up
beer
nothing
huge
in
terms
of
flavour
but
bearing
in
mind
the
style
this
is
to
be
expected
so
this
beer
is
doing
what
the
style
asks
of
it
and
it
is
doing
it
better
than
most
in
the
category
poured
this
from
a
large
can
into
a
glass
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
as
well
id
prefer
a
budweiser
over
this
and

overall
a
suprisingly
good
beer
for
the
style
served
as
cold
as
possible
as
the
beer
warmed
it
still
tasted
alright
with
no
off
tastes
not
completely
unimpressed
but
i
dont
plan
on
buying
any
soon
a
decent
recommendation
for
a
session
beer
or
summer
postchore
refreshment
however
this
beer
is
not
that
bad
it
was
refreshing
i
do
like
the
taste
of
it
but
it
was
not
my
favorite
beer
out
their
i
liked
the
golden
look
that
it
has
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
not
that
bad
at
all
i
had
it
in
a
can
wich
does
change
the
taste
some
i
never
have
had
it
in
a
bottle
but
over
all
this
beer
was
not
all
that
bad
this
a
good
drinking
beer
and
i
would
get
this
again
o
this
beer
gets
slammed
too
much
around
here
its
not
fantastic
but
it
is
worth
more
than
the
2
it
costs
good
session
beer
overall
nothing
exciting
but
not
terrible
either
why
is
this
classified
as
american
lager
is
it
perhaps
made
here
or
in
canada
anyhow
this
is
a
classic
that
goes
way
back
with
me
when
i
was
in
eighth
grade
such
a
large
can
steel
in
those
days
was
quite
a
novelty
and
when
i
found
an
empty
i
just
had
to
take
it
to
school
for
showandtell
well
i
was
so
proud
of
it
that
i
showed
it
to
my
social
studies
teacher
straight
away
his
horrified
countenance
took
me
by
surprise
and
bitter
was
my
anguish
when
he
promptly
confiscated
my
novelty
can
utterly
deflated
i
had
nothing
for
showand
tell
that
day
not
even
dried
dog
food
to
eat
in
front
of
the
class
another
specialty
of
mine
awe
memories
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
here
but
i
was
still
let
down
first
off
its
brewed
in
ga
and
tx
so
its
not
an
import
at
all
i
was
expecting
a
non
adjunct
premium
lager
which
i
did
not
get
over
priced
and
in
the
wrong
cooler
import
cooler
should
be
placed
next
to
other
adjuncts
not
next
to
real
premium
imports
just
stay
away
from
this
one
adjunct
and
not
a
real
import
fosters
was
always
one
of
my
favorites
but
under
the
lens
of
beer
snobbery
i
have
to
admit
that
its
just
not
that
good
now
i
understand
why
ive
never
seen
an
australian
drink
fosters
and
ive
spent
a
fair
amount
of
time
oz
pours
with
exceptional
clarity
light
gold
with
lots
of
lager
bubbles
wafting
toward
the
top
to
meet
a
fat
soapy
head
of
white
foam
that
had
better
retention
that
i
thought
it
might
nose
is
crisp
with
only
a
slight
bit
of
apple
sweet
grain
and
a
bright
hops
character
a
bit
of
lemon
from
those
pride
of
ringwood
hops
as
it
warms
taste
follows
the
nose
all
the
way
the
malt
stays
in
the
background
until
it
warms
and
brings
a
light
dry
cracker
the
apple
is
thin
and
delicious
adding
something
cheerful
and
crisp
the
carbonation
has
a
small
bite
and
the
yeast
imparts
a
bit
of
sourness
to
really
round
out
this
beer
even
though
the
middle
is
quite
dry
and
palate
cleansing
this
beer
finishes
off
dry
and
with
a
bit
of
sweet
lemon
and
is
very
delicious
i
would
have
this
again
fosters
is
okay
i
would
order
one
when
fresh
if
left
to
macro
options
only
the
taste
is
refreshingly
good
just
slightly
sweet
at
first
with
a
more
than
pleasant
bitterness
following
thats
also
how
it
finishes
not
watery
light
but
still
lots
of
taste
overall
this
beer
almost
starts
smooth
the
body
taste
of
weakly
roasted
malts
the
harsh
carbonation
takes
away
from
what
would
be
a
smooth
finish
this
could
almost
have
been
a
good
beer
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
i
would
defenitely
advise
people
to
try
a
few
on
tap
if
given
the
chance
pours
a
strawyellow
in
color
with
about
a
finger
of
a
white
fizzy
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
some
sticky
lacing
was
seen
which
each
sip
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
glass
from
lots
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
some
sweet
grains
thats
about
it
taste
is
the
same
with
a
very
slight
dry
finish
also
has
a
very
slight
bitter
aftertaste
which
isnt
bad
at
all
and
does
not
linger
at
all
overall
i
like
fosters
as
the
adjuncts
go
i
like
fosters
interesting
fact
is
that
nobody
in
australia
drinks
this
but
it
has
been
marketed
in
the
united
states
as
their
national
drink
remarkable
commentary
on
global
capitalism
but
i
digress
oil
can
is
a
great
serving
after
a
long
shift
as
a
line
cook
let
me
tell
you
crisp
and
clean
no
off
aromas
or
flavors
and
while
it
lacks
the
feel
and
complexity
and
richness
of
a
great
ipa
which
i
would
always
prefer
it
refreshes
with
the
best
of
them
light
malt
and
hops
in
balance
but
the
point
is
to
be
drinkable
and
that
it
is
perhaps
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
necessary
but
it
works
for
me
i
just
burp
a
lot
this
is
not
australian
for
beer
at
all
as
they
have
a
diverse
and
burgeoning
craft
industry
there
that
is
way
underrepresented
in
american
markets
but
fosters
has
a
niche
here
and
it
fills
it
well
a
little
more
to
this
one
than
the
american
crap
beers
so
i
choose
it
for
those
reasons
this
is
a
beer
a
lager
what
lager
should
be
if
miller
and
bud
where
this
good
i
would
buy
it
im
not
sure
the
recipe
is
the
same
as
always
but
the
folks
in
texas
got
it
right
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
more
than
20
years
i
can
tell
you
it
has
changed
over
the
years
the
first
ones
had
pull
tabs
and
where
from
australia
then
came
the
canadian
ones
which
wasnt
so
good
now
is
the
texas
brew
which
i
love
its
my
go
to
beer
i
always
buy
the
750
ml
big
cans
its
the
best
in
those
cans
taste
like
lager
should
a
bit
bitter
yet
goes
down
smooth
and
taste
like
beer
use
too
when
i
remember
beer
being
good
most
of
todays
lager
is
too
sweet
and
has
no
taste
or
just
too
watery
this
one
is
a
goodie
as
for
pour
well
i
drink
straight
from
the
can
dont
care
how
she
pours
i
enjoy
it
and
thats
a
rare
find
these
days
in
mass
market
beer
thanks
folks
in
texas
for
making
this
fine
lager
may
there
be
many
days
in
your
venture
the
can
is
very
unique
which
is
why
i
rated
a
high
appearance
overall
just
a
classic
easy
going
taste
with
more
flavor
than
light
mexican
lagers
not
much
to
say
here
crappy
beer
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
fluffy
white
head
good
start
i
guess
aroma
of
stale
corn
and
weak
grass
hops
some
hay
flavor
follows
the
aroma
with
a
slightly
cleaner
finish
than
some
of
the
u
s
garbage
light
body
and
goes
down
rather
easy
do
aussies
drink
this
for
real
i
doubt
it
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
standard
for
the
style
scents
of
crystal
malt
and
the
usual
maize
adjuncts
again
standard
nothing
offensive
nothing
standout
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
a
good
bit
of
maize
adjunct
flavors
and
a
very
very
slight
hop
bitterness
its
a
light
on
complexity
sweet
aal
its
not
offensive
like
some
but
its
nothing
special
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
standard
everything
about
this
beer
is
standard
for
an
aal
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
amazing
either
its
a
decent
warm
weather
aal
way
better
than
its
american
competition
even
if
it
is
brewed
in
texas
a
good
thirst
quencher
in
that
it
is
more
watery
than
any
kind
of
good
beer
flavor
one
might
hope
for
a
big
flavor
from
a
big
beer
can
but
this
lager
is
pretty
nondescript
in
fact
there
is
very
little
taste
or
aroma
worth
getting
excited
about
but
it
is
wet
and
does
have
a
decent
abv
so
if
youre
looking
for
something
to
slake
a
parched
throat
and
you
dont
have
any
decent
cold
water
about
fosters
will
get
the
job
done
otherwise
there
are
too
many
other
better
lagers
out
there
to
satisfy
a
beer
thirst
after
a
long
day
at
work
i
stop
by
the
nearest
corner
store
for
a
cold
one
fosters
in
a
big
ass
can
will
do
had
it
before
in

not
in
the

why
standard
crap
big

lager
by
the
time
i
finished
it
and
tossed
that
huge
can
out
on
the
interstate
i
promise
the
next
time
i
drink
this
will
be
when
im
stranded
on
a

i
can
live
with
this
beer
and
its
imported
novelty
pretty
bad
stuff
overall
i
think
fosters
lager
is
a
rather
solid
beer
its
not
quite
a
beer
that
will
most
likely
have
you
saying
wow
this
is
the
best
beer
ever
but
if
youre
a
beer
drinker
that
doesnt
like
lighter
beers
too
much
i
guarantee
you
wont
be
pushing
it
aside
the
taste
carries
some
of
the
aroma
qualities
which
are
mild
malt
flavor
and
slight
sweetness
with
light
adjuncttype
corny
element
with
thin
body
and
mild
yeast
with
gentle
spice
of
hops
but
pretty
bland
yet
a
slick
and
mildly
fruity
almost
buttery
quality
hints
at
diacetyl
with
a
drying
finish
overall
not
the
worst
i
have
ever
drank
but
not
great
in
a
category
with
so
many
options
this
is
substantially
less
than
average
in
overall
enjoyment
overall
a
relatively
average
beer
that
goes
down
easy
if
you
just
want
something
to
chug
down
in
this
styleprice
range
though
id
probably
stick
with
pbr
or
bud
above
average
adjunct
lager
you
can
feel
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
relatively
speaking
when
i
lived
in
ny
a
long
time
ago
and
there
wasnt
this
craft
beer
scene
this
was
one
of
my
favorities
o
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
the
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
seems
to
be
a
little
more
palatable
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
because
the
bitterness
helps
to
mask
some
of
the
flavors
of
adjunct
malts
o
not
horrible
but
im
certainly
glad
that
more
craft
beer
from
australia
is
becoming
available
in
the
us
this
one
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
pretty
sweet
but
is
certainly
not
anything
special
i
will
likely
not
be
getting
this
one
again
but
if
you
are
going
to
get
it
i
recommend
the
oil
can
final
thoughts
while
better
than
its
american
counterparts
although
i
think
this
import
is
actually
brewed
in
tx
fosters
lager
is
just
plain
bland
theres
nothing
bad
about
its
flavor
but
theres
really
nothing
good
either
would
i
drink
it
again
i
want
to
say
no
but
ill
probably
have
it
again
at
some
point
the
oil
can
gets
this
a
few
style
points
which
is
as
generous
as
i
can
be
fosters
tastes
bitter
and
unpleasant
whatever
flavor
it
might
have
is
overcome
entirely
by
this
enduring
bitterness
surprisingly
fosters
has
some
body
and
isnt
simply
like
water
in
a
can
but
it
isnt
enough
to
make
this
worth
trying
skip
it
i
am
fairly
sure
the
commercials
mean
to
say
fosters
australian
for
gross
overall
fosters
lager
is
an
average
beer
not
great
but
its
from
australia
there
was
nothing
overly
offensive
about
this
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
drink
meh
only
because
it
was
free
and
my
last
name
did
i
drink
another
one
overall
im
glad
i
can
say
ive
had
it
but
sorely
dissatisfied
with
the
product
i
wont
be
having
it
again
anytime
soon
not
bad
at
all
for
a
beer
of
its
type
not
a
great
one
but
i
would
take
this
over
a
bush
any
day
overall
a
pretty
standard
adjunct
lager
rather
bland
as
there
is
not
too
much
going
on
in
the
flavor
profile
section
but
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
making
it
a
decent
session
o
this
beer
is
like
a
sweet
carbonated
beverage
nothing
really
here
to
offer
unless
you
like
bland
sweetness
atop
of
alcohol
australias
classic
lager
soft

and
with

brewed
firtst
time
in

good

qenchener
its
well
past
average
overall
it
is
what
it
is
a
fairly
bland
fizzy
lager
but
honestly
is
isnt
half
bad
i
wouldnt
buy
it
all
the
time
but
the
oil
can
is
cheap
and
convenient
on
occasion
o
i
havent
tried
this
beer
in
years
thinking
that
i
did
not
like
the
taste
hell
i
would
be
happy
with
some
sort
of
taste
comes
to
the
table
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
smallish
but
disappearing
white
head
and
a
steady
stream
of
carb
bubbles
the
aroma
is
lackluster
at
best
sweet
grainy
malt
with
a
hint
of
corn
and
some
light
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
mild
lightly
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
and
a
grassy
grainy
flavor
thrown
in
there
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
to
heavy
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
it
was
a
step
above
the
other
macros
offered
on
tap
note
to
self
sam
adams
was
the
better
choice
today
overall
this
is
odd
in
that
its
a
real
easy
drinking
beer
but
strangely
the
aftertaste
is
not
sitting
well
with
me
however
if
i
continue
drinking
it
it
masks
this
until
i
swallow
strangely
passable
but
a
real
weird
aftertaste
on
this
brew
i
could
live
with
it
but
theres
more
to
beer
than
this
poured
from
a
25
6
oz
can
into
a
lager
glass
beer
pours
a
standard
yellow
with
a
massive
bubbly
white
head
the
smell
is
strongly
of
skunk
and
some
corn
flakes
and
perhapsa
faint
amount
of
grains
nothing
impressive
the
taste
is
pretty
good
some
grains
perhaps
some
creamed
corn
in
the
mixture
pretty
standard
of
an
aal
the
mouthfeel
though
pretty
much
feels
like
any
other
aal
over
all
would
i
buy
it
again
sure
if
i
needed
an
easy
drunk
for
cheap
fosters
in
the
uk
is
viewed
as
just
another
characterless
corporate
pale
lager
brewed
cheaply
with
no
regard
to
quality
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
there
are
many
beers
i
would
rate
as
average
that
are
far
superior
to
this
overall
oh
fosters
if
thats
australian
for
beer
then
you
guys
have
got
a
long
way
to
go
in
so
far
as
aals
go
this
ones
one
of
the
better
ones
but
thats
not
saying
much
this
beer
is
always
served
ice
cold
maybe
to
mask
the
lack
of
flavour
while
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
light
golden
colour
this
tastes
like
any
lager
beer
available
in
india
the
beer
is
simple
no
nonsense
and
a
thirst
quencher
works
well
in
indian
humid
and
hot
weather
ok
to
have
one
once
in
a
while
overall
this
beer
is
decent
not
unique
not
original
but
not
bad
either
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
very
simple
single
flavor
i
wouldnt
drink
these
all
night
or
suggest
it
as
a
favorite
but
one
from
time
to
time
is
fine
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
2
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
random
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
corn
flakes
and
sugar
taste
is
of
grain
and
sweetened
corn
flake
flavors
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
that
quickly
fades
after
each
sip
and
turns
into
a
slightly
medicinal
flavor
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
in
the
main
area
flavor
the
sweet
corn
mixed
with
the
medicinal
flavors
on
the
aftertaste
arent
too
tasty
in
this
one
overall
theres
unfortunately
not
much
to
elaborate
on
this
beer
in
my
opinion
there
could
definitely
be
taste
improvements
instead
the
lager
comes
across
as
very
bland
and
unoriginal
for
down
under
not
too
bad
for
a
mass
produced
product
except
that
i
must
consider
the
bis
involving
this
lovely
summer
weather
which
tells
me
to
sweat
then
subconsciously
find
any
form
of
beer
i
have
been
a
bit
crazy
lately
so
i
figured
this
would
suffice
the
wide
body
can
provides
that
manly
american
pride
that
we
too
often
take
for
granted
we
often
figure
that
the
smell
dictates
the
taste
to
be
similar
but
the
aroma
was
much
more
refreshing
than
the
taste
the
taste
resembles
that
of
good
enough
as
i
guess
most
people
will
not
go
out
of
their
way
to
discover
what
can
be
coined
better

free
o
yeah
drinkable

its

d
not
a
fan
of
this
one
every
pub
in
england
has
this
on
tap
and
is
much
better
that
way
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
lacking
and
only
able
to
get
some
malty
grain
taste
is
again
grainy
and
a
slight
hop
presence
in
the
finish
feels
a
bit
watered
down
fosters
is
how
you
say
not
good
in
australian
overall
the
thing
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
clean
finish
really
this
is
good
and
bad
because
it
speaks
both
to
a
refreshing
quality
about
the
beer
and
an
utter
lack
of
flavor
at
least
the
flavors
that
were
there
were
relatively
well
blended
and
less
offensive
or
starkly
metallic
than
many
others
within
the
style
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
no
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
adjunct
corn
cereal
and
minimal
hops
taste
for
the
most
part
follows
the
smell
and
consistent
with
macrobrew
although
i
found
it
less
repulsive
than
the
bud
family
very
thin
mouthfeel
ok
drinkability
this
is
mediocre
stuff
which
is
strange
i
dont
recall
fosters
being
that
bad
overall
a
very
average
cheap
larger
it
would
be
nice
to
have
one
of
these
beers
for
the
sake
of
having
something
different
even
if
its
not
really
good
its
not
bad
though
overall
im
not
opposed
to
a
good
beach
beer
now
and
then
ill
take
a
fosters
in
an
oil
can
any
day
over
any
other
american
adjunct
lager
however
judging
this
beer
objectively
its
as
average
as
all
of
the
others
in
its
class
but
since
im
a
beer
geek
and
not
a
snob
i
can
drink
this
oil

the

with
a
tremendous
foamy

the
aroma
is
of
adjunct

malts
and
cool
clean

the
body
is
light
the
taste
is
typically
grainy
for
the
style
but
there
is
also
a
slightly
bitter
ending
the
can
is
the
way
to
go
on
this
one
drinkability
i
think
the
can
is
what
provides
most
of
the
flavor
it
is
not
offensive
and
is
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
now
i
know
why
australians
dont
drink
it
enough
said
during
the
summer
this
would
be
refreshing
but
beyond
that
its
not
worth
your
time
sulfur
and
some
sweet
cereal
grain
quite
faint
in
aroma
light
grain
in
taste
and
very
light
bitterness
from
hop
slight
sour
in
the
finish
the
body
is
light
with
watery
mouth
feel
but
very
crisp
yet
fizzy
overall
not
a
worthy
brew
a
bit
dull
wow
id
never
thought
i
review
this
but
after
travelling
overseas
and
seeing
alot
of
this
especially
in
the
uk
i
thought
i
set
the
record
straight
this
isnt
our
only
macro
beer
but
it
seems
to
be
doing
well
especially
in
europe
and
unfortunately
is
well
known
and
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
colour
and
leaves
a
frothy
two
finger
head
and
no
lacing
reallythe
smell
is
grainsbarley
sugar
and
a
touch
of
herbalnessthe
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fuller
than
expected
and
definately
a
little
fuller
than
our
other
macros
and
the
taste
is
basically
the
same
as
smell
pretty
insipid
really
with
hints
of
malted
barleygrains
and
liquid
hops
and
overall
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
unless
of
course
its
the
only
aussie
macro
option
if
you
wanted
a
lesson
on
pride
of
ringwood
hops
here
you
go
id
love
to
try
more
beers
that
feature
a
single
hop
the
beer
is
completely
transparent
and
light
yellow
colored
with
a
thin
wispy
head
the
aroma
is
really
mild
hard
to
get
much
in
the
nose
even
after
letting
the
beer
warm
up
a
bit
perhaps
some
grain
and
general
macro
lager
scents
the
flavor
is
pretty
bland
with
some
hints
of
corn
and
grain
not
awful
or
offensive
in
any
way
but
wholly
unexciting
the
body
is
extremely
thin
as
expected
from
an
adjunct
lager
watery
and
easy
to
drink
rapidly
perhaps
a
decent
beer
to
guzzle
whilst
eating
spicy
chicken
wings
or
play
beer
games
with
but
not
something
i
would
choose
to
savor
or
relish
you
cant
really
hate
any
beer
type
unless
it
smells
like
you
know
however
this
particular
brew
is
a
commercially
successful
and
is
quite
quaffable
for
the
money
pours
golden
nice
but
light
acidity
to
the
taste
goes
down
smooth
this
beer
despite
the
ratings
on
the
board
is
not
going
anywhere
o
meh
novelty
can
thats
all
this
beers
got
going
for
it
overall
not
recommended
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
would
pass
on
it
fosters
i
was
in
a
small
town
in
minnesota
on
business
and
was
trying
to
go
the
week
without
beer
but
after
a
hard
day
i
broke
down
and
did
purchase
a
can
of
fosters
from
the
limited
singles
selection
at
the
only
liquor
store
poured
into
my
hotels
plastic
cup
the
fosters
looked
like
a
drug
test
sample
with
a
fine
white
foam
on
top
the
aroma
was
unpleasant
like
wet
rags
the
flavor
was
a
disappointment
there
was
an
overtone
of
an
unnatural
chemical
like
taste
followed
by
an
unpleasant
bitter
aftertaste
there
is
hardly
a
beer
i
do
not
like
but
fosters
did
fall
into
avoid
at
all
cost
category
overall
this
beer
is
solid
as
far
as
adjuncts
go
this
one
is
superb
the
balance
is
there
the
sweetness
is
minimal
and
theres
no
hint
of
metal
as
is
usually
noticeable
in
this
style
i
would
definitely
put
this
in
my
tailgate
cooler
although
there
are
beers
like
this
with
more
flavor
and
lower
price
thats
not
to
demean
it
in
any
way
its
not
worth
the
price
in
my
opinion
but
its
a
good
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
really
special
that
stands
out
id
rather
stick
to
something
cheaper
maybe
its
just
a
grass
is
greener
effect
but
the
aussies
seem
to
really
know
how
to
make
a
proper
adjunct
lager
i
like
this
stuff
probably
more
than
i
should
and
i
had
a
similar
opinion
of
vb
dont
get
me
wrong
its
an
adjunct
lager
so
ultimately
its
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
but
its
an
adjunct
lager
done
properly
with
some
character
id
take
this
over
most
other
molson
products
any
day
it
is
not
something
i
would
buy
on
my
own
like
i
said
just
an
average
beer
i
just
dont
get
where
this
beer
went
i
know
that
as
soon
as
millercoors
took
it
over
it
hasnt
been
as
good
anyways
i
had
this
beer
at
buffalo
wild
wings
the
other
day
and
i
was
so
disappointed
the
appearance
and
smell
were
just
terrible
it
smelled
and
looked
like
your
basic
crap
beer
and
i
just
wasnt
impressed
the
taste
was
the
worst
part
of
the
beer
it
was
just
of
faint
malt
and
that
was
really
it
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
cant
stand
anything
about
it
and
definitely
the
perfect
drain
pour
it
looks
nice
standard
medium
yellow
frothy
short
lasting
head
it
tastes
just
ok
a
ricey
grain
flavor
to
it
with
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
the
oil
can
is
cute
though
one
of
the
least
offensive
adjunct
lagers
out
there
pours
golden
good
clarity
nice
white
head
nose
has
slight
cooked
vegetables
cereal
grains
and
a
trace
of
smokymetallicherbal
hops
cereal
grain
sweet
on
the
palate
and
the
metallic
hop
element
comes
through
not
harsh
not
cooked
veggies
in
palate
either
novelty
oil
can
packaging
is
a
change
for
me
should
i
go
sit
on
a
street
corner
to
imbibe
it
was
ok
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
i
just
had
to
try
it
though
call
it
a
right
of
passage
if
you
want
o
not
the
greatest
not
the
worst
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
if
it
were
free
i
might
drink
it
overall
i
know
this
beer
is
rated
poorly
on
this
site
but
theres
something
about
the
taste
that
i
enjoy
its
still
just
an
adjunct
beer
but
it
has
a
few
nuances
that
set
it
apart
from
the
rest
you
could
do
worse

i
was

my

my
but
the

was
heavy
in

of
cereal
adjuncts
man
if
they
were
looking
to
nail
the
style
this
was
how
to
do
it
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
curious
admixture
of
cereal
adjuncts
and
a
metallic
tang
on
the
tongue
still
think
that
taste
is
relegated
to
the
area
of
cans
guess
again
finish
was
bland
cereallike
and
that
metallic
taste
was
what
lingered
if
i
am
ever
to
drink
this
again
it
will
be
either
ontap
or
out
of
a
can
this
was
brutal
not
exemplary
particularly
given
that
this
tends
to
represent
australian
beer
to
most
people
although
i
have
it
on
authority
from
an
ozzie
that
it
isnt
really
sold
in
australia
so
its
just
for
export
bland
and
pretty
flavourless
with
an
unpleasant
note
to
the
aroma
if
you
must
drink
it
keep
it
cold
o
an
ok
aal
o
overall
its
fairly
predictable
not
much
aroma
or
flavor
but
not
as
bad
as

and
just
happy
to
have
beer
again
after
being
in
saudi
arabia
fostersis
a
golden
clear
colored
beer
it
has
nice
carbonation
and
white
foamy
head
that
appears
to
be
lacing
well
there
is
no
smell
maybe
grain
if
any
taste
is
ok
not
the
greatest
there
is
a
bit
of
heaviness
with
this
beer
unusual
for
an
american
adjuct
lager
i
dont
mind
heaviness
but
cmon
give
me
some
better
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
maybe
there
is
a
reason
they
dont
serve
fosters
in
australia
overall
this
is
a
beer
to
avoid
even
if
you
like
lagers
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
got
a
little
less
carbonation
than
standard
for
the
style
although
its
obvious
this
was
designed
to
be
drank
straight
from
the
can
as
the
carb
is
huge
from
there
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
as
far
as
a
cheap
drink
goes
this
is
not
bad
at
all
the
huge
can
cost
me
a
buck
and
some
change
and
its
perfectly
drinkable
if
not
anything
thatll
wow
me
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
on
a
budget
overall
i
must
say
that
even
though
fosters
is
australian
for
beer
it
shouldve
been
named
the
word
that
is
australian
for
mediocre
its
cheap
at
my
local
bar
and
now
i
see
why
id
be
happy
to
invite
all
you
df
ba
beer
snobs
to
my
desert
dwelling
for
an
icecold
fosters
but
youd
probably
rather
die
of
thirst
poured
clear
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
fizzles
out
pretty
quickly
light
aroma
of
malts
and
stale
hops
more
of
the
same
to
the
tongue
with
an
acidic
bitterness
that
leaves
a
rotten
aftertaste
thin
sodalike
body
crikey
not
very
drinkable
at
all
mate
sorry
for
that
please
avoid
this
beer
overall
i
would
order
it
again
as
i
enjoyed
it
along
with
my
pizza
d
very
good
drinkability
the
ideal
party
beer
easy
to
throw
a
few
of
these
back
with
no
problem
at
all
nothing
special
but
considering
the
style
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
put
it
up
against
bmc
beers
and
it
would
win
hands
down
malt
profile
is
more
complex
than
would
be
expected
for
the
style
adjucts
are
tasted
but
theyre
actually
balance
with
the
malts
and
taste
quite
good
some
earthy
and
stale
ragidy
hops
in
there
but
eh
thats
the
style
less
watery
with
more
of
a
body
very
crisp
and
refreshing
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
a
pale
gold
with
an
enormous
head
lets
say
four
inches
or
so
mostly
because
i
just
couldnt
get
it
to
pour
out
of
the
can
right
the
mouth
opening
was
poorly
designed
or
something
smelled
very
clearly
metallic
and
sweet
cest
tout
it
tastes
like
grainy
metallic
water
refreshing
but
the
aftertaste
is
once
again
metallic
however
if
it
werent
for
that
this
beer
could
almost
rival
singha
for
refreshment
as
it
doesnt
taste
too
sweet
and
doesnt
taste
like
corn
still
singha
is
clearly
better
fosters
totally
beats
busch
though
if
this
is
on
the
same
price
scale
in
australia
as
busch
is
here
id
say
they
have
it
a
bit
better
over
there
cheers
this
is
what
i
ordered
the
first
time
i
ate
at
the
outback
steakhouse
i
ordered
it
simply
because
i
hadnt
tried
this
beer
yet
i
knew
going
into
it
that
it
was
a
standard
lager
and
wouldnt
be
overly
amazed
by
this
the
beer
is
basically
what
i
expected
its
yellow
and
clear
with
a
pretty
good
head
on
it
the
head
actually
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
flavors
are
of
the
standard
hops
and
malts
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
heavier
on
the
belly
than
something
like
a
coors
original
or
budweiser
apart
from
its
fuller
body
this
beer
isnt
much
different
than
the
rest
of
the
lagers
in
america
overall
there
have
been
only
two
beers
that
i
have
ever
tried
and
vomited
directly
after
drinking
them
one
is
miller
low
life
the
other
is
fosters
lager
i
had
the
displeasure
of
trying
this
beer
during
my
college
years
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
if
i
had
to
choose
between
fosters
or
a
hand
can
of
steel
reserve
with
a
wedge
of
swiss
cheese
blended
into
it
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
the
steel
reserve
avoid
like
the
plague
d
only
one
other
beer
i
have
ever
had
is
worse
than
this
hogwash
san
miguel
one
to
avoid
like
the
plague
o
it
is
a
decnet
beer
for
the
macro
crowd
but
would
not
recommend
it
as
a
craft
offering
pours
a
clean
clear
light
yellow
with
active
carbonation
big
initial
rush
of
head
diminishing
into
nothing
quickly
pale
light
and
watery
scent
with
only
faint
touches
of
grain
and
grass
taste
follows
scent
with
the
pale
and
almost
undetectable
notes
of
pale
malt
and
very
faint
presence
of
grassy
hops
about
the
only
positive
is
that
there
are
now
major
off
notes
not
even
vegitable
notes
found
in
many
aals
light
bodied
bubbly
carbonation
notable
only
for
its
lack
of
off
notes
in
the
style
i
definitely
will
not
have
this
beer
again
but
its
good
to
know
what
you
like
and
what
you
dont
like
so
im
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
almost
completely
clear
with
a
hint
of
yellow
like
i
just
washed
my
tea
bottle
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
just
a
hint
of
grain
the
taste
is
very
light
a
hint
of
grain
and
corn
going
down
its
almost
like
flavored
water
but
you
can
down
a
lot
of
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
chug
session
beer
this
is
a
good
choice
if
youre
looking
for
quality
look
elsewhere
a
typical
tonic
water
type
mouthfeel
very
similar
to
the
majority
of
bmc
products
not
something
ill
drink
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
decent
minimal
aftertaste
is
cold
a
flavor
it
is
very
underwhelming
but
maybe
thats
the
point
im
interested
in
trying
the
lager
but
i
wont
have
it
again
dont
know
how
i
liked
this
more
before
dont
think
it
has
changed
i
have
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
another
one
of
these
but
in
a
pinch
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
if
this
is
australian
for
beer
just
buy
something
better

we

up

two
pitchers
of

with

this

goes

with

after
mowing

and
a

finish
essentially
non
existent
with
just
a
light
bread
like
taste
overall
this
was
just
not
very
good
as
is
the
taste
neither
is
complex
coors
so
i
figured
i
would
see
what
he
was
raving
about
poured
from
a
24oz
oil
can
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
forming
large
head
that
quickly
faded
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
almost
all
grain
nothing
special
there
the
taste
is
very
light
malt
sweetness
but
mostly
the
grainy
flavor
associated
with
this
type
of
beer
light
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
barely
a
step
up
from
bud
or
miller
this
is
just
your
basic
mass
produced
lager
nothing
special
and
not
something
i
care
to
spend
any
money
on
in
the
future
im
not
a
fan
the
head
is
large
and
lasts
and
even
leaves
some
lacing
suprising
i
know
taste
is
weak
slightly
peppery
malts
and
the
faintest
touch
of
citrus
hops
leaves
a
bad
aftertaste
drinkable
but
only
because
its
so
weak
not
somthing
i
would
choose
if
there
were
options
light
nondescript
refreshing
but
watery
drink
up
mates
you
can
really
drink
this
one
though
went
great
with
my
steaks
d
not
bad
for
the
style
it
has
a
little
more
hops
than
most
of
this

i
had
another
choice
overall
not
bad
but
down
the
list
of
imports
id
pick
up
at
the
store
on
the

id
push
aside
several
domestic
macros
to
get
to
this
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
at
a
party
notes
as
a
reformed
macro
fiend
i
must
admit
that
this
is
the
beer
that
i
turned
to
first
it
has
the
drinkability
of
water
with
more
flavor
than
most
am
macros
allinall
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
good
beer
either
this
beer
is
fit
for
cookouts
or
raceday
when
it
is
a
quantity
rather
than
quality
kind
of
occasion
made
in
canada
by
an
australian
company
but
it
is
still
an
american
macro
and
not
a
very
good
one
as
the
philosophy
department
dons
of
the
australian
university
would
say
like
making
love
in
a
canoe
fking
close
to
water
this
beer
pours
a
heavy
golden
head
that
laces
the
glass
adequately
the
scent
is
crisp
clear
and
a
bit
malty
one
of
my
favorite
drinkable
beers
but
the
scent
could
use
improvement
the
taste
is
light
crisp
and
sweet
with
a
slight
hop
after
taste
among
domestics
it
is
defiantly
worth
the
extra
cost
besides
among
foreign
beers
you
get
more
of
a
flavor
for
less
of
the
price
then
other
beers
pours
clear
yellow
with
a
five
finger
white
head
that
surprised
me
by
holding
fairly
well
and
some
lacing
to
the
finish
musty
earthy
smell
taste
has
a
little
more
malt
and
a
little
more
hop
which
gives
it
a
little
more
body
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
fresh
i
think
it
would
great
in
the
summer
with
your
cheeseburgers
and
hot
dogs
leave
this
one
alone
this
brew
was
pretty
damn
bad
of
course
that
is
in
my
opinion
the
functional
features
were
awful
there
was
no
head
no
retention
no
lace
and
no
smell
since
it
wasnt
totally
water
there
was
a
very
light
yellow
peaking
through
the
glass
the
taste
was
rather
rancid
im
not
sure
what
it
was
that
i
was
tasting
but
i
did
not
like
it
the
mouthfeel
was
well
felt
dont
drink
and
review
funny
note
the
can
states
that
fosters
is
the
official
beer
of
formula
1
racing
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
yellow
fizzy
beer
i
couldnt
stomach
much
of
it
but
i
think
they
nailed
the
style
well
enough
this
is
a
decent
lager
a
bit
better
than
average
pours
pale
yellowish
gold
with
a
big
white
head
with
reasonable
retention
pretty
much
standard
smell
and
mouthfeel
for
any
large
produced
lager
but
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
bit
of
malt
to
it
it
drinks
well
but
isnt
anything
special
good
with
seafood
havent
got
around
to
reviewing
this
average
beer
drank
this
one
years
ago
and
recently
tried
a
bottle
and
the
minikeg
can
they
massproduce
the
oil
can
which
i
havent
in
a
long
while
now
remember
why
the
taste
was
very
average
with
a
touch
of
tin
the
best
part
was
the
appearence
which
was
very
average
as
well
the
bottled
version
wasnt
much
better
sans
the
tin
flavor
that
said
the
remaining
beer
in
the
turkeys
butt
did
a
damn
fine
job
bird
was
moist
tasty
and
it
didnt
fall
over
so
for
that
reason
alone
i
see
myself
saying
that
a
12
can
of
fosters
every
last
thursday
in
november
could
become
a
tradition
i
highly
recommend
it
for
its
beer
can
turkey
qualities
and
it
could
be
a
lot
worse
as
far
as
the
beer
you
drink
to
make
room
in
the
can
to
do
so
gobble
gobble
gobble
clear
golden
yellow
pour
with
average
head
and
unremarkable
lacing
nose
is
dominated
by
nondesscript
grainssome
sweetness
and
little
else
likewise
for
the
taste
which
is
sweet
and
malty
up
front
and
a
bit
drier
toward
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
similarly
ok
as
for
the
drinkability
well
i
got
through
34
of
the
glass
before
i
dumped
it
drinkability
not
bad
lager
but
its
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
the
concensus
among
the
australians
that
ive
met
over
the
years
is
that
none
of
them
drink
fosters
at
home
its
either
victoria
bitter
or
castlemaine
xxxx
for
most
that
ive
spoken
with
coopers
is
my
personal
aussie
favorite
and
fosters
definitely
aint
coopers
all
the
above
categories
could
be
summed
up
very
easily
see
also
my
review
for
budweiser
fosters
is
simply
a
pretty
good
lager
beer
that
is
appropriately
categorized
in
with
american
macros
it
may
be
a
little
hoppier
than
bud
but
that
s
pretty
much
the
only
difference
that
i
can
discern
solid
middle
of
the
road
macro
lager
that
is
best
suited
for
repetitive
consumption
during
yardwork
barbeques
and
other
warmer
weather
activities
i
seem
to
recall
from
my
younger
days
many
years
ago
that
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
not
any
more
we
were
flying
back
from
texas
and
i
wanted
a
couple
beers
this
seemed
like
the
best
of
some
bad
choices
it
was
a
clear
yellow
with
a
small
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
it
had
an
aroma
of
graincorn
taste
was
very
vague
id
describe
it
as
somewhat
sweet
and
leave
it
at
that
not
much
either
way
for
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
like
water
is
drinkable
australian
for
bud
you
would
drink
this
in
australia
if
youre
rebelling
from
the
throngs
of
carlton
draughtvb
aficionadoes
if
youre
trying
to
experience
beer
even
australian
beer
please
look
further
afield
the
beer
cleared
up
a
little
and
drank
easily
but
then
the
smokey
flavor
came
back
later
that
was
strange
for
me
and
i
hoped
this
would
be
better
on
tap
not
sure
what
the
commercial
description
was
talking
about
but
apparently
was
not
this
brew
aroma
was
next
to
nothng
flavor
was
very
heavy
grain
with
some
hops
which
led
to
a
dry
bitter
not
in
a
good
way
aftertaste
coopers
is
australian
for
beer
fosters
is
australian
for
stay
in
australia
fosters
i
dont
want
you
here
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
a
ring
of
lace
clean
aroma
with
not
much
going
on
except
for
a
bit
of
faint
malty
grain
taste
is
extremely
bland
that
features
a
bit
of
grain
and
a
slight
hop
presence
in
the
finish
not
too
impressed
at
all
with
this
one
save
your
time
money
and
effort
not
a
lot
more
to
say
really
australia
can
do
better
well
a
nice
pour

lemon
yellow
and
a
frisky
white
head

some
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
too
but
wow
what
a
horrid
aroma
of
stinkin
cooked
veggies
and
the
quaff
of
raw
fish
doesnt
do
much
for
my
afternoon
this
crap
is
bad
but
im
not
the
one
to
toss
it
down
the
sink

thats
alcohol
abuse
im
gonna
tough
this
out
and
move
on

if
this
is
what
they
brew
down
under
i
feel
for
the
bas
down
there
pours
a
thin
yellow
gold
with
a
white
foamy
head
nice
headbut
lousy
color
the
smell
is
very
light
with
sweet
malt
and
vegatables
pretty
much
typical
macro
the
taste
is
a
thin
watery
corn
malt
flavor
thats
not
too
pleasant
and
its
tough
to
finish
the
mf
is
light
with
the
flavors
mixing
well
what
flavors
there
are
this
is
not
good
and
i
had
a
tough
time
finishing
this
beer
in
my
youth
i
liked
this
and
its
amazing
how
after
drinking
good
craft
beer
how
bad
the
large
macros
are
its
pretty
much
as
i
remember
it
prior
to
83
when
carlton
and
united
was
bought
by
elders
but
its
smoother
now
and
maybe
thats
just
my
changing
palate
im
not
sure
where
it
was
brewed
then
fosters
lager
was
light
golden
in
color
and
very
clear
it
started
out
with
a
decent
white
head
but
soon
only
a
thin
layer
remained
it
had
a
faint
hop
aroma
it
tasted
a
little
better
than
the
average
macro
but
thats
not
saying
much
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
and
fizzy
it
does
go
down
fairly
easily
on
hot
day
but
is
far
from
my
first
choice
overall
not
a
bad
brew
it
is
nothing
spectacular
but
i
would
pick
this
up
again
when
selection
is
low
had
an
oilcan
paired
with
some
honey
dijon
kettle
chips
and
the
chips
completely
overwhelmed
the
taste
of
this
beer
not
a
good
start
appearance
is
slightly
better
than
most
of
the
american
macros
has
a
slight
redcopper
hue
to
it
the
smell
is
mostly
of
rice
and
budweiser
bleh
the
taste
again
wiped
out
by
chips
for
crying
out
loud
but
mostly
malt
little
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
below
average
like
most
mass
produced
lagers
would
be
watery
but
the
drinkabilty
is
good
plus
its
an
oil
can
yo
be
hip
ill
give
it
to
them
on
that
cool
idea
with
the
oil
can
dont
know
why
my
buddy
enjoys
this
so
much
this
beer
looks
great
when
you
pour
it
it
has
a
clean
golden
color
like
a
lot
of
lagers
but
it
has
a
nice
head
on
it
that
settles
into
a
medium
light
lacing
it
has
a
mellow
fruity
smell
and
it
seems
like
it
will
taste
the
same
when
you
take
a
drink
however
it
has
almost
no
taste
and
a
grainy
after
taste
that
makes
it
a
little
hard
to
swallow
it
has
a
crisp
feel
that
is
reminiscent
of
its
watery
taste
it
has
no
real
exciting
qualities
to
its
drinking
i
wouldnt
mind
comparing
it
to
its
real
australian
counterpart
sorry
fosters
drinkable
while
mowing
the
yard
or
eating
at
outback
otherwise
avoid
drinkability
i
got
through
it
thats
an
accomplishment
avoid
this
beer
at
all
costs
drinkability
is
very
easy
goes
down
smooth
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
that
hangs
with
you
my
only
complaint
is
with
the
carbonation
which
hurts
a
lot
more
than
it
helps
the
flavour
would
come
through
just
fine
if
it
were
allowed
to
sit
and
lose
its
fizzyness
provided
the
temperature
was
maintained
bottom
line
refreshing
beer
for
hot
summer
days
when
your
nonba
pals
dont
want
any
weird
beers
like
wheats
or
kolsches
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
watery
slightly
dry
finish
d
barely
drinkable
frankly
high
carbonation
and
sweetness
fills
you
up
promptly
just
way
too
sweet
drinkability
drinks
like
a
somewhat
deeper
version
of
budweiser
plenty
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
entries
in
this
style
ive
had
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
a
very
even
nice
typical
yellow
i
always
pictured
beer
to
be
this
color
but
as
we
know
usually
it
is
off
from
expectations
the
initial
head
is
nice
and
leaves
a
respectable
amount
throughout
the
drinking
process
the
smell
is
exceptionally
better
than
most
beers
i
have
been
tasting
lately
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
then
you
tilt
your
cup
back
and
let
it
hit
your
mouth
hmmm
this
isnt
what
i
expected
quite
bitter
but
still
decent
i
think
this
beer
would
be
great
with
some
bbq
or
if
you
want
something
with
a
bit
more
taste
than
the
typical
macrobrews
that
closely
resemble
water
definately
worth
a
try
ill
probably
have
this
in
my
fridge
again
someday
but
not
in
the
foreseeable
future
medium
yellow
with
a
pillowy
white
mediumsized
slowly
diminishing
head
smell
is
of
weak
grainy
malt
and
just
the
slightest
whiff
of
hops
the
taste
is
weak
as
well
and
a
bit
uninteresting
but
fairly
good
for
what
it
is
lightly
sweet
grainy
bread
with
only
really
showing
up
on
the
dry
finish
it
has
a
mediumthin
body
dry
texture
and
moderatelow
carbonation
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
it
would
be
fine
with
bbq
or
buffalo
wings
a
small
step
from
the
usual
macros
but
hey
if
you
like
fine
there
is
worse
a
mediumlight
body
and
not
much
flavor
i
remember
this
stuff
tasting
much
better
in
australia
ontap
there
are
some
aussie
beers
id
recommend
this
is
not
one
of
them
too
much
hype
not
enough
taste
poured
a
thick
head
that
quickly
was
cut
in
half
a
very
golden
clear
color
very
active
carbonation
looked
like
it
was
snowing
upside
down
smelled
slightly
better
than
most
commercial
brands
the
taste
was
soso
its
not
a
very
complex
beer
like
the
micro
brews
i
usually
drink
it
just
tasted
like
beer
to
me
nothing
special
overall
a
refreshing
beer
the
sweetness
could
be
a
matter
of
taste
i
would
recommend
and
would
get
it
again
very
little
head
and
no
lace
for
this
sickly
pale
everage
that
being
said
it
has
a
nonoffensive
neutral
taste
with
an
exceptable
smoothness
that
goes
down
without
a
struggle
it
doesnt
have
the
stink
of
a
lot
macro
brews
either
and
its
not
overly
sweet
this
is
an
acceptable
macro
brew
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
ill
take
it
over
bud
any
day
d
drinkability
for
a
macro
lager
is
decent
easily
washes
down
a
steak
or
any
other
food
in
front
of
you
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
fizzy
drinkability
is
not
good
too
much
corn
for
my
tastes
but
i
was
on
the
plane
and
i
felt
like
a
beer
so
in
this
case
it
did
the
trick
next
time
ill
have
to
try
the
budweiser
select
which
i
heard
will
soon
be
replacing
fosters
on
southwest
to
be
continued
this
is
the
final
offering
from
the
beer
down
under
6
pack
this
offering
poured
a
banana
yellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
just
bubbles
on
top
the
nose
is
clean
hoppy
with
a
small
fruit
essence
the
taste
is
clean
crisp
clear
highly
malty
with
a
soda
consistancy
the
finish
is
nice
a
hop
bite
in
the
end
that
finishes
clean
and
refreshing
your
typical
macro
lager
nothing
special
but
very
drinkable
da
moderation
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
you
could
get
carried
away
with
so
i
wouldnt
go
further
than
23
of
these
without
expecting
a
headache
the
next
morning
hahaha
d
all
of
that
said
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
its
just
boring
in
other
words
they
go
down
easy
its
canadian
for
beer
mate

4
ounce
oil
can
i
remember
when
the
cans
really
looked
a
lot
like
oil
cans
not
that
ive
seen
an
oil
can
in
10
years
or
more
pours
a
typical
macro
yellow
with
a
decent
head
smells
like
adjunct
tastes
like
adjunct
decent
lawnmower
beer
not
really
good
for
much
else
though
i
think
thats
rice
in
the
taste
along
with
the
watery
texture
and
mighty
carbonation
there
isnt
much
here
for
the
discerning
beer
drinker
but
mild
enough
for
non
beer
nerds
to
quaff
at
the
barbecue
i
could
see
it
being
better
on
a
hot
day
at
the
beach
with
a
steak
or
a
burger
but
the
same
could
be
said
for
a
lot
of
beers
pass
note
the
can
says
its
brewed
by
fgb
breweries
in
toronto
under
the
supervision
of
carlton
united
breweries
melbourne
austrailia
molson
brews
a
fosters
lager
out
of
ontario
but
this
does
not
appear
to
be
it
it
doesnt
appear
to
be
the
real
australian
beer
either
so
im
not
sure
what
is
up
with
this
brew
i
guess
its
a
true
macro
you
cant
tell
who
made
it
or
where
or
why
d
due
to
the
skunky
factor
i
cant
see
drinking
more
than
two
of
these
however
if
you
are
looking
for
something
a
bit
lighter
with
more
flavor
its
a
definite
thumbs
up
maybe
a
little
better
than
budweiser
no
just
diferent
really
not
a
beer
for
people
who
get
bored
easily
notice
thats
not
a
value
judgement
just
a
simple
brew
that
doesnt
pic
my
interest
drinkability
comparable
to
bud
one
of
the
prototypical
neutral
macrobeers
however
considering
the
price
of
this
export
youre
better
off
with
a
sam
adams
instead
sweet
honey
and
raw
corn
taste
a
tad
grassy
and
grainy
its
one
of
those
major
adjuct
lagers
and
you
know
what
to
expect
going
in
served
better
at
a
colder
temp
and
has
a
regular
drinkability
level
drinkability
i
am
sure
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
them
but
would
get
pretty
bored
after
one
6
pack
and
would
want
to
get
somthing
else
all
in
all
decent
session
brew
a
six
pack
of
this
was
given
to
me
by
my
future
motherinlaw
who
said
i
know
you
like
fancy
beer
help
me
in
glass
has
a
nice
yellow
gold
color
with
a
pure
white
head
smells
like
rotting
vegatables
and
tastes
about
the
same
couldnt
get
half
of
this
stuff
down
my
throat
hmmm
maybe
use
the
rest
to
boil
shrimp
in
fosters
australian
for
budweiser
this
was
definately
a
disappointing
beer
i
thought
it
would
be
a
pleasant
experience
i
was
expcting
something
like
labatt
blue
turned
out
to
be
not
spectacular
or
too
exciting
but
a
decent
brew
that
would
be
readily
drinkable
no
such
luck
fosters
turns
out
to
be
sort
of
like
bud
on
steroids
color
is
decent
though
pale
fosters
has
some
noticable
tan
in
with
the
yellow
head
is
high
and
relatively
well
formed
and
though
it
will
die
long
before
you
finish
the
beer
it
will
also
leave
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
where
you
can
tell
something
is
wrong
theres
some
wierd
chemical
scent
in
there
with
the
grains
turns
out
its
some
combination
of
crappy
hops
and
our
old
friend
adjunct
grains
the
grain
part
of
the
beer
really
isnt
that
bad
its
slightly
sweet
and
like
the
color
suggests
stronger
than
the
lightest
of
american
macros
but
the
hops
suck
and
there
are
some
inferior
grains
in
there
and
they
combine
to
produce
lingering
chemical
nastiness
and
astringent
bitterness
that
ruin
the
beer
and
theres
no
excuse
for
this
fosters
thats
sold
in
america
is
actually
brewed
in
canada
so
the
taste
isnt
from
skunking
due
to
a
trip
around
the
world
and
molson
who
can
make
a
decent
beer
when
they
sell
it
under
their
own
name
is
the
subcontractor
so
the
problem
isnt
that
fosters
picked
a
bad
partner
the
crappiness
of
this
beer
is
their
own
fault
and
seems
to
be
due
to
inferior
ingredients
fortunately
australian
for
bud
does
not
translate
to
as
bad
as
bud
this
still
was
my
48th
of
50
beers
i
drank
for
a
beer
club
so
it
wasnt
like
id
been
rushing
to
drink
this

initially
this
beer
showed
a
lot
of
promise
okay
flat
malt
quality
in
the
smell
that
was
quite
surprising
taste
is
the
same
very
bready
like
drinking
whole
wheat
wonderbread
not
bad
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
drinkable
as
a
session
quaffer

which
i
believe
are
leading
to
the

jun

2004
taste
has
more
character
than
a
budweiser
but
just
barely
thin
mouthfeel
but
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
when
theres
nothing
else
lying
about
but
domestic
macrobrews
but
theres
little
to
distinguish
it
from
us
macros
sorry
to
say
this
is
a
drain
pour
the
label
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
says
that
fosters
lager
is
the
definitive
australian
beer
ive
had
very
few
beers
from
the
land
down
under
but
that
has
to
be
the
biggest
load
of
bollocks
that
ive
heard
in
a
very
long
time
i
guess
fosters
is
austrialian
for
mediocre
i
didnt
like
this
brew
much
and
would
probably
rather
save
the
money
and
buy
a
similair
tasting
american
macro
for
less
well
yesterday
was
the
big
memorial
day
bbq
after
a
few
hours
my
personal
stash
was
depleted
and
since
im
never
one
to
turn
down
a
free
beer
i
hit
up
the
fosters
this
stuff
is
your
basic
golden
yellow
leaning
a
little
more
towards
golden
than
yellow
big
super
foamy
white
head
smells
like
a
cheap
lager
some
grain
tatse
hella
corn
esp
if
it
warms
a
bit
cooked
corn
veggies
very
light
hop
bite
eh
pretty
crisp
in
the
mouth
served
ice
cold
it
was
refreshing
its
not
a
good
beer
but
its
a
beer
and
i
like
beer
from
the
oil
can
pours
a
light
golden
clear
liquid
with
a
white
foamy
almost
fluffy
head
this
was
more
colorful
than
other
pale
lagers
the
head
actually
stayed
for
a
little
while
but
there
was
no
lace
on
the
glass
smells
slightly
skunky
and
metallic
but
there
could
be
trace
amounts
of
hops
here
taste
is
very
sweet
and
grainy
at
first
followed
by
a
subtly
amount
of
hops
thin
but
true
to
style
and
highly
carbonated
overall
there
are
worse
beers
than
this
it
was
sort
of
refreshing
i
wouldnt
buy
this
from
a
store
but
that
is
all
that
is
available
i
would
probably
choke
one
down
again
a
fine
white
collar
on
a
pale
golden
color
the
smell
is
very
sweet
with
lots
of
citrus
and
maybe
even
some
ginger
the
taste
is
malty
and
round
very
citric
and
sweet
the
thin
hoppiness
is
a
bit
skunky
not
a
complex
beer
but
a
drinkable
one
a
truly
average
beer
pours
clear
and
light
gassycabadgy
nose
watery
no

typical
macro
lager
no

no
hops
tasts
like
alot

from
down

nothing
more
nothing
less
skip
this
stuff
if
you
can
a
shameful
waste
of
good
water
served
cold
in
a
pilsner
glass
from
a
cold
bottle
midsized
rocky
head
tops
a
golden
clear
liquid
moderate
carbonation
aroma
is
a
mix
of
corn
sulfur
faint
hops
with
a
bit
of
malt
underneath
the
foretaste
is
sweeter
than
an
everyday
macro
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
very
little
malt
character
in
the
midtaste
finish
is
an
underdone
crisp
bitterness
the
bottles
i
had
may
have
been
a
little
lightstruck
this
beer
offers
nothing
extraordinary
it
was
an
utter
disappointment
poured
into
my
plastic
cup
with
minmal
head
that
doesnt
cover
the
beers
surface
yellow
clear
big
bubbles
zero
aroma
taste
is
all
obscured
by
the
freezing
serving
temperature
and
the
intense
carbonation
barely
a
hint
of
grain
thin
gaseous
i
guess
you
could
say
this
is
balanced
if
youre
balancing
zero
hop
presence
with
zero
malt
pretty
crap
it
pours
from
the
oil
can
a
light
transparent
yellow
with
absolutly
no
head
the
aroma
well
didnt
exist
it
was
completly
scent
free
the
taste
was
very
watered
down
there
was
a
strong
sweetness
to
it
but
not
any
sign
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
at
all
i
feel
like
i
wasted
my
time
on
this
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
where
else
an
australianthemed
steakhouse
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
long
while
and
i
always
remember
enjoying
it
this
was
served
in
a
nearly
frosted
mug
and
was
very
cold
light
yellow
color
and
fizzy
with
a
small
fizzy
head
no
real
aroma
to
speak
of
since
the
temperature
was
holding
it
back
and
theres
the
fact
that
the
pungent
smell
from
a
cheeseburger
at
the
table
next
to
me
is
wafting
right
into
my
face
i
did
pick
up
a
hint
of
slightly
metallic
grains
the
taste
is
pleasantly
sweet
and
slightly
malty
sweet
tang
with
some
fruitiness
crisp
finish
and
overall
surprisingly
smooth
an
enjoyable
lager
that
complimented
my
steak
nicely
i
always
dismiss
this
beer
for
something
else
but
it
seems
to
be
one
i
routinely
enjoy
i
havent
had
a
fosters
in
years
tonights
experience
ensures
that
i
wont
have
another
one
in
the
next
decade
im
reluctant
to
trash
a
beer
but
most
of
this
was
poured
down
my
sink
hopefully
a
snpa
will
clean
my
palate
and
get
rid
of
the
aftertaste
of
this
swill
it
is
ok
drinkable
if
you
are
in
need
and
us
macros
are
the
only
choice
there
are
better
brews
for
the
price
like
a
sam
adams
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
short
lived
white
foamy
head
you
can
smell
the
malts
with
slight
hints
of
hops
and
the
yeast
is
very
funky
smelling
in
this
beer
the
taste
is
subpar
tastes
like
a
to
sweet
of
a
malt
that
doesnt
have
enough
hops
to
round
out
the
sweetness
feels
light
and
flat
in
the
mouth
and
is
not
a
drinkable
beer
go
with
other
lagers
easy
to
drink
not
a
great
a
beer
but
an
ok
brew
to
drink
when
the
bar
only
offers
macro
beers
ay
mate
it
is
drinkable
but
then
so
is
water
and
i
dont
want
water
when
i
want
beer
look
its
not
truly
vile
but
its
so
unsubstantial
that
everything
about
it
just
seems
to
fall
short
and
its
the
lack
of
any
real
gravity
that
makes
it
drinkable
but
just
because
i
can
drink
more
than
one
doesnt
mean
i
will
if
i
ever
make
it
down
under
it
wont
be
in
pursuit
of
beer
but
i
do
hope
theres
better
than
this
waiting
for
me
if
i
want
one
drank
the
big
can
really
liked
it
its
a
beer
when
your
really
thirsty
i
thought
it
was
a
little
bit
heavier
than
a
light
beer
and
at
the
end
when
you
swaloe
it
taste
like
a
dark
beer
for
a
second
way
better
then
mgd
coors
light
more
flavor
but
you
must
drink
this
beer
ice
cold
keep
the
can
as
soon
as
this
beer
gets
hotter
it
is
awfl
to
drink
like
a
typical
american
macro
i
probably
could
not
tell
it
apart
in
a
blind
taste
test
and
i
had
to
pay
more
for
this
i
used
to
like
this
and
probably
will
still
buy
a
big
oil
can
now
and
then
for
the
coolness
factor
impresses
people
at
bbqs
at
least
the
store
didnt
have
light
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
average
or
slightly
less
than
it
is
of
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
it
is
dry
and
musty
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
the
can
from
which
it
came
the
taste
is
weak
and
bitter
the
musty
flavor
is
bold
it
is
a
bit
grainy
and
simplistic
i
sense
the
presence
of
brewing
adjuncts
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
like
most
commercial
lagers
the
body
is
low
and
the
carbonation
is
high
it
drinks
awful
i
must
admit
this
one
was
had
only
for
the
beer
karma
this
beer
comes
a
no
supprise
but
i
was
still
hoping
for
better
it
poured
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
small
head
that
faded
very
quickly
into
a
thin
layer
of
foam
the
smell
was
grain
all
the
way
with
not
much
else
detectable
the
taste
was
not
quite
as
sweet
as
a
coors
or
a
miller
but
was
still
overly
sweet
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
bite
at
the
end
i
have
not
had
this
beer
in
quite
a
while
untill
tonight
and
i
think
i
can
go
the
rest
of
my
life
without
having
another
one
thumbs
down
canadian
for
beer
pale
straw
colored
white
lacing
subtle
carbonation
malt
rice
and
hops
noticable
an
off
metallic
twang
to
it
pretty
lackluster
but
ive
put
my
lips
up
to
worse
its
mostly
sweet
and
finishes
with
crisp
with
evidence
that
the
brewers
use
less
than
quality
hops
kind
of
musty
not
so
fresh
regular
hoppy
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
a
keggy
taste
too
nothing
spectacular
but
if
i
went
to
a
barbecue
id
much
like
seeing
this
beer
in
the
cooler
than
coars
light
poured
from
a
bottle
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
last
at
all
there
isnt
much
of
a
smell
at
all
maybe
some
corn
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
equally
as
disappointing
seems
to
be
very
sweet
all
the
way
through
creamy
but
not
in
a
good
way
i
cant
pick
up
any
hops
what
so
ever
i
can
think
of
many
other
pale
lagers
that
i
would
prefer
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
pbr
on
tap
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
on
a
hot
summers
day
but
that
is
about
it
this
brew
pours
a
light
golden
colour
with
a
small
white
head
of
foam
the
aromas
are
all
light
zesty
hops
and
slight
bready
malts
the
taste
is
very
uncomplex
yet
thirst
quenching
at
the
same
time
the
mouthfeel
is
light
in
the
mouth
and
the
same
as
the
canned
version
of
this
brew
however
for
some
reason
i
find
the
drinkability
to
be
less
from
the
bottled
version
go
figure
at
one
time
this
was
my
wifes
favorite
brew
im
glad
to
say
that
she
now
likes
ipas
hefes
etc
so
at
least
it
didnt
turn
her
off
beer
for
good
i
usually
like
just
about
any
kind
of
beer
out
there
but
this
beer
actually
proves
that
the
only
good
alleged
thing
to
come
out
of
australia
really
does
suck
even
a
guy
like
dan
grimaldi
would
not
drink
crap
like
this
and
he
is
the
kind
of
guy
who
would
lick
beer
off
of
a
floor
very
little
head
mouthfeel
is
not
so
desirable
it
kinda
pissed
me
off
that
i
even
bought
it
brewed
in
canada
i
remember
this
as
a
beer
that
gave
me
a
nasty
headache
the
next
morning
not
any
more
an
at
least
unoffensive
odor
taste
is
just
a
bit
more
malty
than
in
a
normal
american
beer
and
i
catch
a
bit
of
hop
in
the
aftertaste
had
i
not
found
much
more
interesting
brewpub
lagers
i
might
have
rated
this
higher
but
now
i
know
better
theres
so
much
more
out
there
and
this
is
so
much
less
drinkability
i
was
fully
expecting
to
slam
this
by
saying
the
only
really
good
thing
about
this
is
the
manly
sized
container
but
its
not
all
that
bad
does
what
a
lager
ought
to
do
hits
the
right
notes
and
all
that
rot
too
bad
the
notes
make
for
britney
spears
when
im
looking
for
velvet
underground
im
ashamed
that
we
get
lumped
with
this
beer
alas
its
deserved
on
some
levels
if
aussies
in
general
knew
anything
about
beer
we
wouldnt
allow
it
dammit
that
this
is
not
the
case
on

canadian
version
clear
yellow
brew
with
a
nice
head
usual
macro
brewery
taste
of
maltsugarwater
maybe
a
tad
too
much
water
this
is
drinkable
but
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
lager
for
hot
summer
days
i
get
the
feeling
this
might
not
even
be
imported
ber
bu

license
in

the
beer
pours
the
archetypal

it
is
a
beer
when
the

yes
better
than

it
is

most
people
would
like
this
watery
concoction
it
has
a

in

with
its

cousins
from
north
america
and
might
be
enjoyable
enough
with
a
barbecued
hamburger
or
hot
dog
on
its
own
it
offers
very
little
satisfaction
except
perhaps
as
a
thirst
quencher

americas
unholy
macro
trinity
fosters
is
a
lifeless
brew
drank
by
the
exceedingly
desperate
me
in
this
case
or
those
who
think
drinking
an
aussie
macro
makes
them
cool
if
fosters
is
australian
for
beer
as
the
advert
goes
then
there
are
some
serious
problems
in
the
land
down
under
not
for
snobs
but
excellent
for
what
it
is
this
beer
tops
its
category
light
lager
drinkability

the
kangaroos
are
probably
spitting
this
one
out
fosters
adds
a
smooth
style
to
the
standard
piss
formula
but
this
ale
has
little
else
to
offer
appearance
fizzy
golden
with
a
nice
sized
frothy
white
head
with
decent
scattered
patches
of
lacing
aroma
grassy
hop
character
with
a
mild
sweet
tone
not
bad
just
clean
and
decently
hopped
for
most
lagers
taste
a
trickle
of
bitter
sweetness
here
some
corn
and
rice
is
probably
present
doesnt
seem
all
grain
not
a
bad
hop
profile
decently
bitter
for
a
lager
too
bad
this
is
the
biggest
knockoff
of
an
australian
beer
considering
its
brewed
in
canada
other
than
that
it
finishes
clean
and
unoffensively
take
it
for
what
it
is
a
mass
produced
lager
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
artificially
carbonated
not
cloying
pretty
smooth
just
uninteresting
drinkability
as
much
as
you
can
put
down
before
you
cant
handle
the
flavor
anymore
not
filling
and
doesnt
make
me
yearn
for
another
yet
i
cant
tear
it
apart
glad
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
not
a
beer
for
2
times
id
still
skip
it
next
time
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
ever
had
this
but
it
was
all
there
was
today
at
suzannes
house
well
banish
me
to
beer
hell
it
wasnt
all
that
bad
pale
straw
color
with
big
white
head
that
settled
in
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
that
left
pretty
good
lace
aroma
is
pretty
standard
for
a
lager
smooth
malty
taste
with
a
decent
hint
of
bitterness
you
know
for
an
import
lager
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
im
not
going
to
seek
this
one
out
of
course
but
i
wont
blow
it
off
if
its
available
and
i
dont
have
many
options
drinkable
in
a
relative
sense
if
you
know
what
i
mean
funny
that
the
commercials
promote
this
as
australian
for
beer
but
its
really
not
one
of
the
more
popular
beers
in
australia
anyway
pours
a
very
average
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
the
aroma
is
grainy
but
not
too
interesting
the
taste
is
a
little
watered
down
and
a
little
grainy
as
well
so
its
not
all
that
enjoyable
but
not
bad
for
a
macrobrew
had
one
ontap
whereelse
an
outback
steakhouse
it
arrived
very
cold
in
a
frosted
mug
i
think
that
put
stress
on
the
head
for
it
was
thick
but
more
like
thick
in
spots
lace
was
good
but
not
a
good
read
from
the
mug
carbonation
was
medium
the
straw
color
and
white
head
matched
the
somewhat
grassy
aroma
the
taste
was
crisp
well
balance
of
malt
and
some
hop
bitter
to
roundout
the
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
brew
but
rather
drinkable
with
a
burger
or
a
heavy
breaded
onion
goodenough
that
ill
pick
some
up
for
a
home
bottle
taste
nor
will
i
shy
away
from
it
out
when
its
available
i
didnt
find
this
beer
objectionable
at
all
it
was
a
perfectly
fine
representative
of
an
international
macrobrewed
pale
lager
in
other
words
utterly
average
light
gold
color
large
white
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
sweet
light
hops
and
malts
light
tasting
lager
full
round
mouthfeel
good
flavor
nice
balance
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
aftertaste
is
smooth
and
slightly
bitter
that
said
it
still
a
lager
other
than
the
corn
taste
not
much
really
stands
out
on
this
one
reminds
me
of
budweiser
in
a
few
ways
label
both
under
the
boring
macro
category
not
my
favorite
lager
but
certainly
completely
drinkable
in
its
own
right
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
if
faced
with
a
lousy
beer
selection
you
could
probably
fall
back
on
it
and
be
alright
better
than
most
macros
though
it
seems
to
have
something
of
a
funky
aftertaste
which
prevents
me
from
rating
it
more
highly
i
just
got
this
at
the
whitecaps
single
a
pro
baseball
team
game
the
only
reason
i
got
this
was
because
my
other
choices
were
standard
macro
swill
it
actually
poured
really
nice
with
a
solid
clean
head
better
than
most
lagers
the
smell
sort
of
threw
me
off
because
it
was
sweeter
than
most
lagers
and
i
didnt
like
it
but
the
taste
was
good
enough
nothing
special
just
a
solid
amount
of
malts
and
hops
were
present
not
a
bad
beer
for
watching
a
ballgame
on
a
hot
day
this
brew
poured
a
creamy
while
head
of
fine
bubbles
it
had
a
standard
hoppy
lager
beer
aroma
and
a
transparent
straw
orange
color
with
carbonation
it
left
some
lacing
as
the
head
receded
it
had
a
slightly
fizzy
foretaste
of
hops
with
a
very
mild
somewhat
bitter
after
bite
it
went
down
real
easy
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
not
great
not
bad
just
middle
of
the
road
this
brew
poured
a
white
foamy
head
it
left
excellent
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
it
was
gold
color
in
body
it
had
a
bitter
taste
to
it
it
also
had
an
aftertaste
that
seemed
to
linger
this
beer
does
not
have
much
character
to
it
it
reminded
me
of
when
i
rated
bud
in
other
words
i
was
not
very
impressed
with
this
brew
notes
my
opinion
of
fosters
lager
keeps
getting
worse
and
worse
i
first
tasted
this
beer
many
moons
ago
when
i
was
a
teenager
19
expierienceing
my
first
trip
to
london
it
was
better
then
made
in
aussie
then
much
later
i
tasted
it
again
in
america
the
canadian
version
it
was
reasonable
in
the
oilcan
but
this
in
the
12
oz
bottle
was
pretty
bad
stuff
whats
going
on
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
thin
white
head
left
in
a
hurry
noticable
smells
were
mostly
corn
and
metal
taste
was
along
the
same
lines
sweet
corn
water
sulfer
smells
and
metallic
tinged
water
some
buttery
flavors
finish
sweetness
lingers
bubbly
fizzy
feel
watery
and
light
not
much
to
impress
here
and
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
hey
it
was
free
this
can
was
brewed
in
canada
straw
colored
and
very
thin
malt
malt
hops
i
cant
positively
identify
any
common
beer
ingredients
bread
soaked
in
dishwater
aroma
fizzy
white
head
disappears
rapidly
but
i
dont
miss
it
evenly
weak
and
sad
follows
the
american
megabrewing
formula
for
making
good
commercials
awful
beer
aussies
must
cringe
at
the
australian
for
beer
claims
on
draught
via
the
outback
no
head
but
the
glass
was
filled
to
the
rim
dark
gold
in
color
mostly
a
malt
presence
maybe
a
slight
hint
of
hops
a
semi
sweet
malt
taste
with
a
slight
dry
finish
pretty
decent
mouth
feel
and
drinkable
i
didnt
like
the
frosted
mug
made
the
beer
too
cold
a
average
brew
fosters
is
the
beer
to
go
to
at
the
gas
station
when
all
they
have
is
macros
and
luckily
this
sitting
by
the
tequiza
it
gets
a
little
warm
here
in
phoenix
every
now
and
then
and
a
nice
cold
fosters
really
hits
the
spot
when
you
are
out
working
in
the
yard
the
beer
is
a
standard
looking
beer
with
the
typical
foamy
head
of
a
lager
such
as
this
the
smell
takes
me
a
little
off
guard
each
time
almost
metallic
in
nature
which
coincides
with
the
way
it
feels
in
my
mouth
i
find
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
nice
but
lacks
in
complexity
all
in
all
still
a
good
drinkable
beer
of
course
if
youre
going
to
get
a
fosters
you
had
better
get
the
big
can
comes
out
looking
real
yellow
pretty
big
head
but
my
pour
was
splashing
all
over
not
a
bad
beer
if
youre
going
for
a
standard
lager
but
nothing
special
by
any
means
couldnt
taste
it
much
but
granted
i
had
a
nice
goose
island
right
before
give
it
a
shot
i
guess
dont
get
your
hopes
up
to
high
though
25
4
ounce
the
oil
can
as
it
is
commonly
referred
to
this
sucker
is
heavy
pours
a
transparent
clean
yellow
with
some
instant
carbonation
and
a
huge
white
bubbly
head
that
makes
efforts
to
cling
throughout
initial
smell
was
tough
maybe
of
corn
and
a
bit
floral
not
too
much
to
get
excited
about
a
taste
of
malt
and
light
corn
both
very
thin
and
light
finishing
with
somewhat
of
a
watery
wheat
taste
clearly
a
step
up
just
one
from
the
macros
nothing
spectacular
though
memo
to
fosters
put
some
type
of
freshness
date
on
these
it
scares
me
when
a
grocery
store
puts
these
oil
cans
on
sale
for
1
25
not
a
good
sign
i
wish
i
had
been
able
to
try
a
fosters
from
australia
this
one
is
from
canada
pretty
much
like
an
american
style
lager
straw
in
color
with
a
medium
white
head
taste
is
malty
with
decent
hops
not
bad
going
down
this
is
better
than
bud
by
far
i
liked
this
australian
offering
brewed
under
license
in
canada
it
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
fair
head
that
fades
quickly
and
a
nice
aroma
crisp
clean
taste
of
grainy
goodness
enough
hops
to
balance
the
fairly
sweet
start
reasonably
fullbodied
for
a
macro
brew
there
was
much
to
like
and
nothing
offputting
about
this
nice
clean
lager
clearly
this
would
be
very
tempting
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
lager
was
the
2
50
fire
sale
at
the
flying
saucer
tonight
it
was
a
clear
golden
with
a
fair
head
the
malt
was
present
in
the
nose
with
a
slight
presence
of
hops
the
bitterness
was
more
noticable
on
the
tongue
than
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
good
good
enough
to
have
a
second
pint
the
mouthfeel
was
light
it
was
good
for
2
50
to
have
several
rounds
but
was
not
a
memorable
beer
any
time
i
drink
a
fosters
its
only
because
i
feel
like
drinking
a
beer
that
comes
in
a
bigass
can
thats
about
its
only
appeal
to
me
its
basically
australias
and
by
australias
i
mean
canadas
version
of
a
budweiser
minimal
flavour
save
for
that
sweet
sweet
taste
of
tin
and
minimal
colour
pours
just
like
it
tastes
light
and
boring
blah
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
lace
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
grains
with
a
hint
of
honey
taste
is
light
and
crisp
flavors
of
sweet
malts
come
through
up
front
followed
by
a
bready
taste
and
then
a
mildly
bitter
hop
finish
an
average
beer
thats
nice
on
a
hot
day
this
was
one
average
well
actually
below
average
beer
i
thought
it
would
be
good
since
most
things
from
australia
is
good
ie
surfing
rugby
and
women
it
was
really
light
and
had
no
head
at
all
except
for
the
carbonation
the
taste
was
that
of
a
skunky
one
i
had
it
once
and
that
was
enough
for
me
i
would
be
willing
to
try
this
drink
on
tap
sometime
to
contrast
the
difference
with
the
canned
product
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
do
give
it
approval
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
aroma
was
crisp
and
clean
and
was
a
very
well
balanced
brew
a
joy
to
drink
this
beer
has
the
appearance
of
a
brew
of
far
less
quality
that
is
not
to
say
that
this
is
a
good
beer
its
merely
average
many
people
say
this
is
a
good
beer
simply
because
of
its
allure
of
being
imported
and
slightly
above
average
price
pours
a
light
head
on
top
of
its
molson
golden
look
a
like
body
just
looks
flavorless
has
no
noticable
fragerances
worth
mentioning
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
not
many
beers
are
meant
to
be
drank
very
cold
but
this
is
one
that
is
as
it
has
no
real
prominent
flavors
to
hide
it
serves
best
as
a
cooler
offer
than
something
to
relax
and
indulge
in
fairly
average
beer
not
very
impressive
but
not
too
bad
either
one
of
its
characteristics
its
that
its
easy
to
drink
and
i
mean
really
easy
to
drink
not
that
its
watery
but
refreshing
grabbed

a
slight
amber
hue
body
had
small
bubbles
and
a
thin
white
foamy

very
watery
and
the
only
taste
comes
in
the
mild
bitterness
of
the
finish
taste
gets
more
bitter
and
unpleasant
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
this
is
an
overrated
import
beer
pairs
well
with
bbq
and
spicy
foods
and
is
very
refreshing
when
icy
cold
light
colored
not
too
much

this
is
a
bad
beer
one
oil

is
all
it
takes
to
realize
how
bad
it
really
is
you
have
to
force
down
every
sip

must
be
something
better

just
a

but
not
a
dissappearing
act
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
this
brew
seemed
better
than
all
the
oil
cans
from
my
memory
hardly
a
world
beater
though
fosters
is
not
austrailian
for
beer
a
few
of
my
best
friends
are
austrailian
and
they
swear
by
coopers
which
i
have
yet
to
sample
but
they
all
say
fosters
is
not
what
you
should
think
of
when
you
think
of
oz
it
is
light
and
it
is
a
decent
lager
it
is
nothing
special
a
little
bitter
but
definitely
drinkable
out
of
the
oil
can
it
was
not
so
bad
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
soon
but
you
can
drink
it
nothing
striking
but
drinkable
the
brew
has
an
odd
crystal
yellow
with
a
foamy
head
that
actually
stuck
around
for
a
while
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
fraction
of
a
hop
present
and
absent
malts
a
pretty
light
body
with
a
slight
scratch
of
the
tongue
its
light
sweet
body
and
taste
make
it
best
for
quenching
a
warm
thirst
try
it
so
you
can
say
you
have
clear
light
golden
hue
topped
by
a
fluffy
relatively
persistant
head
that
leaves
a
loose
lace
cooked
corn
light
graininess
generic
sweetness
and
a
metallic
note
in
the
aroma
hop
nose
is
virtually
absent
husky
almost
astringent
grain
hit
the
palette
upfront
and
are
followed
by
flavors
of
corn
and
subtle
sulfur
typically
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
a
touch
grainy
w
residual
lingering
sweetness
that
isnt
particularly
enjoyable
theres
nothing
to
be
savored
here
at
all
rough
yet
weak
all
around
just
like
my
rating
of
this
lager
average
across
the
board
the
aroma
is
not
bad
and
the
taste
is
ok
at
best
but
there
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
here
i
would
rather
drink
a
yuengling
if
i
had
a
choice
and
for
me
that
is
really
saying
somethign
about
this
beer
slightly
above
average
standard
beer
i
would
only
advise
if
your
only
other
options
were
along
the
budweiser
line
that
isnt
really
meant
as
a
compliment
either
back
in
my
college
days
i
thought
fostersmoosehead
and
michelob
were
the
smoothest
best
tasting
beers
to
be
found
on
tap
i
always
kind
of
equated
fosters
with
michelob
for
smoothnessive
learned
about
michelob
since
then
too
im
drinking
this
one
out
of
the
ol
master
cylinder
and
the
memories
outshine
the
actual
product
in
my
hand
this
is
decent
for
a
basic
lager
clean
crisp
thirst
quenching
and
it
does
have
a
smoothness
to
it
what
i
also
notice
is
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
on
the
long
finish
it
is
not
loaded
with
flavor
and
in
some
regards
tastes
like
the
canadien
beers
where
it
is
now
made
for
u
s
consumption
on
a
par
or
better
than
most
american
lagers
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
special
beer
by
any
means
like
i
used
to
pours
a
light
pale
yellow
with
a
2
finger
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
a
very
strange
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
not
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
watery
and
drinkability
is
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
a
highly
marketed
beer
that
are
usually
smooth
due
to
lack
of
character
not
recommended
at
all
medium
gold
color
with
a
decent
snow
white
head
quite
carbonated
good
lace
aroma
of
cooked
grains
with
faint
malt
tasting
yields
an
initial
slight
sting
of
carbonation
followed
by
slight
malt
finish
is
very
dry
with
an
odd
bitterness
another
reviewer
noted
that
the
bitterness
is
not
like
that
typically
associated
with
hops
i
found
this
to
be
true
as
well
more
of
a
medicinal
character
than
hoppy
unless
its
free
i
will
not
be
trying
this
one
again
the
medicinal
bitterness
put
me
off
fosters
lager
in
the
25
4
ounce
oil
can
brewed
in
canada
very
light
looking
lager
with
a
dense
head
adjuncty
aroma
awful
the
overwhelming
taste
is
bitter
but
not
hops
bitter
aspirin
melting
on
your
mouth
bitter
soapy
aftertaste
but
not
a
pleasant
aftertaste
i
used
to
like
this
beer
not
anymore
an
australian
beer
brewed
in
canada
and
drank
by
me
in
the
u
s
very
uninspiring
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
finish
but
nothing
exciting
where
are
the
big
oil
cans
of
this
stuff
that
i
remember
from
years
ago
below
average
at
best
taste
is
very
average
solid
refreshing
but
not
challenging
or
complex
by
any
means
fosters
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
body
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
then
others
of
the
same
style
after
being
raised
in
a
budweiser
family
fosters
was
my
first
effort
to
try
something
different
in
my
younger
days
i
really
liked
it
in
the
old
metal
can
before
they
switched
to
aluminum
the
fact
that
i
liked
the
beer
better
with
a
bit
of
tin
flavor
should
have
been
a
clue
its
pretty
average
down
the
line
for
a
bigbrewery
lager
it
has
nothing
to
distinguish
it
as
exceptionally
good
or
bad
i
have
friends
that
are
drawn
to
the
novelty
of
the
big
can
the
flavor
of
the
beer
however
isnt
any
better
than
a
domestic
macrobrew
that
you
can
pick
up
has
a
slight
smell
to
it
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
it
skunky
havent
really
tried
it
in
a
bottle
to
see
if
that
would
help
it
out
as
an
aussie
and
a
self
proclaimed
experienced
beer
drinker
the
other
day
i
had
my
first
ever
fosters
strange
that
noone
drinks
the
stuff
over
here
with
that
out
of
the
way
i
bought
one
sat
down
at
my
seat
my
usual
drinking
companion
was
having
his
first
also
and
at
the
same
time
we
said
water
then
struggled
to
finish
the
rest
of
it
no
taste
really
probably
not
going
to
have
another
for
quite
some
time
i
hear
that
this
beer
is
considered
to
be
swill
in
austrailia
the
american
import
version
is
brewed
under
license
in
canada
with
that
said
i
say
who
cares
i
like
this
beer
because
it
is
usually
easy
to
find
in
restaurants
and
has
a
smooth
malty
bready
flavor
and
aroma
thirst
quenching
and
reasonably
priced
if
i
cant
get
a
high
quality
micro
or
a
sam
adams
ill
gladly
default
to
this
brew
light
golden
looks
like
any
runofthemill
lager
no
smell
to
speak
of
tastes
rather
runofthemill
but
doesnt
have
any
aftertaste
to
speak
of
smooth
and
refreshing
at
any
temperature
perhaps
its
more
acceptable
because
it
isnt
american
placebo
effect
gloden
lager
with
a
thick
airy
head
very
smooth
feel
and
taste
for
a
lager
malty
smooth
finish
tasty
very
thin
but
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
like
this
ground
maize
aromas
if
youve
ever
had
asahi
its
almost
identical
faint
straw
color
completely
transparent
mild
bitterness
in
the
mix
id
prefer
a
bud
or
coors
to
be
quite
honest
notes
a
pretty
drinkable
lager
nothing
to
go
beer
crazy
over
a
good
beer
to
wash
down
a
working
mans
meat
and
potatoes
meal
gold
in
color
not
much
adjunct
smell
smell
to
speak
of
poured
a
big
rocky
head
which
stuck
around
for
the
entire
oil
can
has
a
sort
of
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
was
rather
boring
with
a
rather
crap
beer
aftertaste
i
am
rather
dissapointed
not
something
id
turn
down
if
offered
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
consume
in
fact
id
say
that
most
american
macros
are
more
worthy
of
consumption
than
this
stuff
despite
what
the
world
thinks
we
aussies
dont
drink
this
crap
once
again
i
think
it
must
be
brewed
by
someone
else
in
north
america
coz
the
aussie
version
tastes
like
chemicals
this
one
falls
under
the
classification
of
lawnmower
beer
had
just
a
bit
more
character
when
it
was
made
in
australia
now
its
contract
brewed
in
canada
uncomplicated
but
uninspired
but
better
than
ab
brands
mass
produced
run
of
the
mill
swill
growing
up
this
one
of
my
favorites
probably
because
of
the
oil
can
i
tried
it
again
recently
and
was
a
bit
dissapointed
taste
is
similar
to
an
american
lager
very
light
nothing
special
bottled
seems
a
little
better
than
the
canned
version
contract
brewed
for
the
north
american
market
in
canada
this
beer
has
always
struck
me
as
being
more
like
a
lessthanaverage
canadian
lager
it
looks
and
smells
like
an
aright
lager
but
one
taste
from
its
oil
can
container
and
it
becomes
this
beergod
awful
beverage
from
down
under
hell
sure
the
adverts
in
the
us
are
funny
but
it
hardly
helps
to
mask
its
hard
to
swallow
taste
thanks
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
oh
what
the
hell
drank
thisw
for
a
short
amount
of
time
wandered
away
from
it
one
of
those
beers
that
take
son
a
different
personality
when
doctored
up
with
lime
and
salt
but
unadjusted
it
is
a
fairly
fizzy
joint
that
lacks
taste
whats
there
is
corned
up
and
barely
bitter
just
not
a
good
thing
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
or
spice
it
pours
and
looks
nice
rancid
corn
no
smell
a
little
bit
of
lemon
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
a
pale
lager
after
that
not
very
unique
apart
from
the
small
impact
of
lemon
flavor
although
it
is
decent
my
favorite
mexican
import
try
it
to
be
honest
here
this
beer
has
some
horrible
reviews
because
it
is
considered
the
garbage
of
garbage
beers
because
it
is
cheap
and
people
turn
their
noses
to
it
i
honestly
believe
if
the
company
relabeled
the
brand
it
would
do
pretty
good
it
has
a
miller
high
life
taste
to
it
with
a
lemon
zest
after
taste
i
do
not
care
for
non
dark
beers
but
this
one
i
love
o
better
than
i
though
sub
decent
drinking
experience
2
and
a
quarter
out
of
5
ok
not
great
good
on
a
hot
day
made
my
review
comparing
to
other
cervazes
great
color
and
smell
not
as
great
tasting
as
dos
equis
amber
or
corona
firmiliar
but
not
bad
a
little
too
much
carbonation
o
bad
beer
would
rather
have
a
bud
it
tastes
better
than
corona
i
dont
have
too
much
to
say
about
this
weak
lager
it
tastes
similar
to
other
mexican
beers
like
sol
and
corona
there
isnt
too
much
to
this
beer
its
not
the
worst
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
definitely
below
average
surprisingly
this
beer
rates
better
among
bas
than
pacifico
which
i
thought
was
a
much
superior
beer
oh
well
to
each
their
own
i
wont
be
returning
to
this
one
lite
gold
and
thin
white
head
disappears
immediately
bread
notes
and
flavor
lite
crisp
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
cerveza
on
a
hot
florida
day
in
my
opinion
the
best
mexican
beer
still
better
than
many
inexpensive
brews
for
a
hot
afternoon
good
beer
with
some
mexican
food
tecate
is
a
tricky
beer
if
you
can
get
some
made
in
the
northern
states
of
mexico
youll
get
a
good
beer
if
you
get
some
from
middle
or
southern
mexico
youll
get
something
awful
smooth
needs
salt
good
chugger
if
in
mexico
good
for
getting
drunk
while
your
eating
tacos
in
the
summer
thats
it
served
in
a
pint
glass
its
that
beer
that
dont
taste
so
good
but
youll
end
up
keep
drinking
them
taste
is
similarly
bland
and
unassuming
few
of
the
rough
edges
found
in
its
competitors
but
whats
left
over
is
pretty
hard
to
pin
down
might
just
be
the
most
dull
beer
ive
yet
to
sample
at
least
skunk
tastes
like
something
theres
a
corn
syrup
sweetness
and
thats
about
all
watery
body
that
is
oddly
coupled
with
fairly
mellow
carbonation
usually
thin
beers
are
fizzy
if
one
really
and
truly
focuses
theres
a
grassy
hop
note
shouldnt
be
this
hard
though
far
too
sterile
and
stripped
down
although
some
might
rank
it
above
its
countrymen
due
to
a
lack
of
clear
cut
flaws
its
hard
to
criticize
a
performance
when
the
performer
takes
no
risks
nice
n
crispy
refreshing
beer
not
terrible
but
nothing
special
nothing
nice
to
say
about
this
beer
overall
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
nafta
was
clearly
a
big
mistake
i
have
never
given
a
rating
this
low
if
i
finished
mowing
the
lawn
and
had
to
choose
between
bottled
water
and
tecate
i
would
just
drink
water
just
bad
all
around
bad
better
than
corona
and
dos
equis
and
cheaper
i
actually
find
it
quite
nice
when
it
is
ice
cold
with
a
lime
there
are
better
lagers
out
there
but
id
give
this
a
try
personal
opinion
try
to
find
it
in
a
can
these
aals
get
skunky
and
not
in
a
good
way
to
me
in
bottles
no
good
really
really
bad
not
as
bitter
as
other
cervesa
i
freaking
love
this
beer
dont
expect
much
other
than
a
cheap
mexican
beer
not
bad
not
horrible
i
could
drink
this
smells
and
tastes
like
cheap
swill
bad
beer
in
a
can
im
guessing
they
import
this
stuff
to
the
us
because
they
dont
want
it
i
first
noticed
tecate
in
the
movie
hellboy
2
of
all
places
out
of
curiosity
i
picked
some
up
and
tried
it
fairly
tasty
but
i
thought
itd
be
stronger
great
session
beer
great
refreshing
taste
mexican
economy
class
beer
the
taste
is
also
more
malty
than
anything
else
akin
to
a
german
lager
a
clean
finish
there
is
nothing
unique
about
it
overall
3
07
not
too
impressed
and
i
liked
sol
a
lot
better
next
time
i
reach
for
a
mexican
lager
beer
ill
go
for
sol
or
modelo
especial
those
are
my
top
two
taco
beers
haha
im
a
bit
of
a
beer
snob
but
tecate
tecate
and
i
go
way
back
this
beer
is
the
best
cheap
beer
in
the
market
tied
up
with
pbr
best
party
beer
when
you
dont
wanna
break
out
the
good
stuff
rub
a
little
lime
salt
and
cayenne
on
the
rim
of
the
can
and
have
a
good
time
best
when
chasing
tequilas
overall
this
is
not
the
most
terrible
beer
in
the
world
its
certainly
not
something
ill
pay
for
but
in
a
pinch
with
no
craft
options
this
could
be
an
acceptable
choice
i
first
had
this
beer
on
a
sailboat
called
hotel
california
off
the
coast
of
santa
barbara
california
it
was
all
part
of
the
experience
something
new
i
drank
it
so
it
couldnt
have
been
too
bad
my
first
beer
when
i
was
15
in
mexico
i
will
give
it
a
5
because
in
mexico
its
a
whole
different
beer
than
what
they
sell
in
the
states
i
liked
it
at
first
but
it
got
musty
and
left
a
grainy
kind
of
feeling
in
my
mouth
smelled
just
how
it
tasted
i
am
no
connoisseur
but
i
really
like
this
beer
i
like
a
thicker
mouth
feel
and
this
seems
to
be
just
right
i
also
dont
like
very
bitter
beer
and
this
has
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
enough
to
let
me
know
it
is
beer
but
thats
just
about
it
i
find
a
depth
to
the
flavor
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
carbonation
is
on
the
light
side
and
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
like
others
mentioned
head
is
light
but
that
does
not
matter
when
you
like
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle
not
as
bad
as
you
have
been
led
to
believe
this
is
the
definitive
mexican
macrobrew
and
its
better
than
any
american
macro
still
a
little
too
much
corn
and
maybe
rice
tecate
brewed
by
cervecería
cuauhtémoc
moctezuma
s
a
de
c
v
with
an
abv
of
4
5
this
brew
pours
out
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
tecate
is
a
filtered
brew
you
can
see
right
though
it
this
looks
an
american
style
lager
this
brew
smells
like
corn
and
grains
nothing
bad
but
not
good
i
would
say
the
smell
is
decent
to
this
brew
the
taste
to
this
brew
is
real
nice
it
goes
nice
and
smooth
this
reminds
minds
me
of
an
american
style
lager
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
and
taste
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
and
refreshing
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
this
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
they
did
a
real
nice
job
with
this
brew
i
will
buy
this
brew
again
in
terms
of
mexican
beer
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
along
with
corona
it
has
a
medium
flavor
background
in
my
opinion
and
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
though
not
in
an
overpowering
way
its
probably
great
with
some
yummy
mexican
food
and
is
perfect
as
an
everyday
sort
of
beer
reasonably
priced
too
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
great
to
drink
straight
outta
the
canbottle
or
adding
some
lime
andor
salt
to
the
rim
i
love
it
with
tacos
burritos
enchiladas
quesadillas
chalupas
rice
nachos
beans
refried
beans
tortillas
and
salsa
and
so
much
more
it
is
a
perfect
beach
beer
cold
from
the
cracked
styrofoam
cooler
as
you
lounge
with
some
hot
babes
and
the
suns
in
your
eyes
drink
some
tecate
and
then
go
boogie
boarding
youll
love
it
o
very
refreshing
and
sessionable
lager
cheers
overall
a
decent
if
unmemorable
lager
better
than
the
bigger
boys
purchased
as
part
of
a
variety
12
pack
of
mexican
beers
this
beer
is
only
a
little
better
than
the
previous
one
sol
and
is
probably
also
a
little
better
than
a
corona
faint
praise
indeed
i
was
looking
for
something
a
little
lighter
and
ive
certainly
enjoyed
some
mexican
beers
in
the
past
but
these
are
terribly
bland
i
suspect
that
they
are
intended
to
be
spruced
up
with
some
salt
hot
sauce
lime
andor
tomato
excellent
medium
mexican
beer
that
hits
that
pitch
between
light
and
heavy
with
a
look
that
says
the
same
good
choice
to
have
with
a
mexican
dinner
barbeque
meal
pairing
or
alone
with
a
springtimefall
appeal
for
me
light
fragrance
agreeable
only
a
slight
bite
o
not
much
nose
not
much
flavor
typical
mexibeer
many
years
ago
before
i
discovered
the
joys
of
craft
beers
i
used
to
drink
tecate
and
busch
but
thats
another
story
and
really
enjoyed
it
when
i
drank
this
can
i
was
unpleasantly
surprised
by
the
lack
of
flavor
and
body
i
remember
this
as
a
darker
chewier
beer
either
the
beer
or
my
taste
have
radically
changed
maybe
both
this
is
a
good
beer
at
a
good
value
tecate
is
a
corn
adjunct
lager
that
blends
the
corn
flavor
with
barley
malt
flavor
in
a
unique
and
satisfying
way
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
12
oz
glass
pours
translucent
straw
with
a
nice
white
head
but
it
dissipates
almost
immediately
smells
of
grain
and
corn
very
sweet
tastes
of
water
and
grain
very
watery
beer
is
very
watery
but
good
carbonation
overall
a
below
average
beer
overall
decent
for
the
price
overall
not
bad
for
a
mexican
beer
not
quite
dos
equies
but
better
than
corona
im
all
danked
out
having
survived
on
nothing
but
high
ibu
ipas
for
months
i
bought
a
12pack
of
tecate
wanting
something
cold
and
refreshing
that
serves
its
duty
then
goes
away
without
making
a
big
relationship
out
of
things
the
way
ipas
are
want
to
do
and
for
a
fling
tecate
is
the
way
to
go
crisp
and
slightly
dry
with
soda
crackers
toasted
white
bread
and
other
innocuous
starches
being
the
main
flavors
detected
finishes
extremely
clean
slight
hop
flavors
but
also
no
big
adjuncts
either
cornvegetable
husk
is
not
a
discernible
flavor
possibly
rice
which
also
may
be
why
this
brew
finishes
so
dry
this
beer
gets
low
ratings
because
it
is
ubiquitous
and
macro
not
because
it
tastes
bad
one
of
the
better
warm
weather
beers
youll
find
and
surprisingly
good
o
there
are
far
better
choices
if
you
want
a
mexican
beer
this
one
is
like
drinking
an
aal
the
taste
is
similarly
nondistinctive
slightly
sweet
watery
with
a
very
weak
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
a
disappointmnet
really
o
somehow
this
tecate
tastes
better
than
any
ive
ever
had
before
i
had
many
and
always
enjoyed
tecate
for
what
it
is
a
great
cheap
beach
beer
overall
definitely
not
a
favorite
as
far
as
mexican
aals
go
its
passable
t
malty
alcohol
and
clean
hop
presence
i
would
not
buy
this
regularly
but
it
beats
a
bud
or
any
other
mexican
lager
o
overall
an
easydrinking
and
unoffensive
beer
that
underwhelms
tecate
beer
is
part
of
the
familys
reunions
over
in
méxico
so
i
cant
be
a
little
snob
and
choose
what
type
of
beer
i
want
either
you
man
up
and
drink
it
or
go
watch
the
kids
and
help
out
in
the
kitchen
anyways
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
although
i
prefer
it
from
the
bottle
we
mostly
get
in
cans
its
a
strong
bodied
full
flavor
beer
that
will
get
you
felling
good
within
2
simply
put
the
beer
is
a
beer
pong
beer
something
you
dont
mind
spilling
or
wasting
accidentally
and
things
of
that
nature
the
abv
is
so
low
it
takes
me
1012
to
feel
buzzed
overal
this
beer
is
not
good
i
take
a
corona
and
pacifico
before
this
beer
even
a
natural
ice
and
icehouse
the
feel
is
a
bit
less
refreshing
then
other
mexican
adjuncts
but
the
flavors
and
scent
are
better
so
i
feel
it
makes
it
better
than
so
many
others
in
the
final
analysis
despite
modelo
especials
slightly
more
complex
flavor
profile
i
might
still
choose
a
tecate
over
a
modelo
especial
im
a
fan
of
crisp
lagers
and
mild
hop
flavors
and
despite
feeling
somewhat
watery
towards
the
end
tecate
delivered
in
those
two
departments
more
than
modelo
especial
did
cheers
peace2all
o
theres
no
upside
to
this
brew
and
adding
lime
would
be
wasteful
i
try
to
be
open
minded
to
this
style
i
like
corona
and
landshark
for
example
tecate
however
is
quite
poor
to
me
o
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
the
smell
is
horrible
but
the
taste
isnt
as
bad
still
the
flavor
is
full
of
adjunct
and
there
is
no
detectable
quality
ingredients
i
would
only
have
this
if
it
was
this
or
budweiser
or
bud
light
with
all
of
that
said
however
this
beer
will
probably
not
win
any
awards
at
beeradvocate
because
it
lacks
any
qualities
or
features
that
distinguishes
itself
from
the
average
light
lager
overall
just
your
typical
mexican
light
beer
yet
worse
at
least
they
give
you
a
lime
with
a
corona
and
dos
equis
has
some
darker
malts
to
compensate
hulk
its
your
typical
mexican
beer
light
and
only
drinkable
in
a
mexican
all
inclusive
resort
at
the
pool
side
bar
with
that
said
since
i
walked
into
a
bar
in
arrlington
va
and
was
offered
it
for
1
00
i
had
to
at
least
try
it
below
average
adjunct
lager
sweeter
more
use
of
corn
high
on
offflavors
and
less
crispy
given
lack
of
hops
and
low
carbonation
stay
away
hard
to
get
worse
i
just
had
3
mexican
adjunct
lagers
and
they
all
tasted
almost
exactly
alike
only
saddle
differences
these
were
even
worse
than
the
american
versions
i
would
definatly
avoid
both
at
all
costs
dont
waste
your
money
even
if
you
are
in
mexico
overall
its
a
cheap
way
to
get
drunk
with
a
group
of
friends
or
wash
down
some
barbeque
or
party
food
not
something
id
drink
if
im
trying
to
savor
the
beer
at
first
pouring
it
out
of
the
bottle
is
none
too
impressive
it
has
an
adverse
yellow
look
although
it
does
create
a
fluffy
white
head
with
some
lacing
down
the
pint
glass
the
smell
also
we
your
average
hoppy
scent
now
for
the
interesting
part
for
pouring
such
a
head
the
beer
had
very
little
carbonation
feel
in
the
mouth
it
also
had
very
little
after
taste
where
i
expected
quite
a
bit
speaking
of
taste
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
plenty
of
barley
a
nice
mix
of
malt
which
these
mex
beers
specialize
at
it
seems
to
me
and
just
an
overall
taste
that
left
me
wanting
for
more
final
thoughts
it
might
not
be
a
fair
comparison
but
this
stuff
to
me
is
corona
done
right
make
no
mistake
an
award
winning
beer
it
is
not
and
im
honestly
a
bit
perplexed
at
how
they
managed
to
give
the
hops
that
sandy
accent
but
all
in
all
you
could
do
worse
o
overall
its
a
below
average
beer
the
smell
and
taste
gave
me
a
headache
not
sure
why
other
people
might
like
it
better
have
i
seriously
never
had
tecate
before
hm
time
to
fix
that
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
relatively
shortlived
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
corn
light
white
bread
and
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
more
hard
water
and
a
touch
of
toasted
cornmeal
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
limp
little
beer
but
one
that
avoids
becoming
entirely
offensive
overallbetter
than
corona
not
better
than
pacifico
great
beer
with
jalapeno
cheese
chex
mix
the
beer
was
satisfying
when
my
mouth
was
on
fire
it
is
better
straight
from
a
bottle
it
doesnt
look
good
in
a
glass
its
just
the
type
of
cheap
brew
to
drink
while
eating
baja
fish
tacos
in
a
taco
shack
on
the
beach
i
tried
the
canned
version
from
a
gas
station
it
is
definitely
better
than
corona
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
someone
brought
a
case
to
watch
a
game
id
drink
it
but
i
would
not
buy
it
myself
below
average
now
to
be
fair
if
its
cold
enough
it
can
be
very
drinkable
overall
heavier
than
the
us
version
and
much
more
enjoyed
an
hispanic
friend
introduced
this
to
me
and
it
shows
how
different
a
beer
can
be
from
the
export
version
i
can
drink
probably
several
of
these
as
opposed
to
the
us
version
which
is
thin
corny
pathetically
disgusting
the
natural
mexican
version
is
a
much
heartier
version
of
the
beer
and
much
more
enjoyed
this
is
a
much
more
enjoyable
version
than
the
typical
uspurchased
version
salud
the
beer
poured

i
review
for

i
refuse
to
let
my
prejudices
slant
any
review
nothing
worse
than
the
typical
beer
snob
reviewing
an
aal
same
for
your
aal
drinker
reviewing
a
craft
brew
o
it
is
what
it
is
overall
its
not
a
beer
i
hate
its
not
something
id
make
a
habit
of
drinking
but
it
wouldnt
kill
me
to
drink
another
after
cutting
the
grass
on
a
hot
afternoon
tecate
i
never
met
a
beer
i
did
not
like
but
some
i
like
less
than
others
and
the
tecate
fits
into
the
like
less
than
other
category
the
tecate
has
a
golden
color
ample
carbonation
and
a
weak
head
the
aroma
is
of
corn
mash
and
having
been
in
ethanol
plants
i
know
what
corn
mash
smells
like
the
flavor
is
watery
with
a
weak
malt
sweetness
and
no
appreciable
hop
flavor
or
bite
pbr
or
bud
has
this
brew
beat
by
a
mile
i
am
surprised
that
there
is
enough
demand
for
this
beer
to
get
a
spot
on
the
shelf
a
watereddown
brew
inoffensive
there
are
worst
brews
out
there
is
about
it
reviewed
keeping
the
style
in
mind
poured
this
american
adjunct
lager
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
lager
poured
a
pale
straw
color
produced
a
thin
white
head
poor
retention
and
below
average
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
lager
has
some
suggestions
of
grain
and
hops
not
much
to
talk
about
on
that
front
light
in
body
the
lager
features
some
malted
grain
some
sweet
notes
and
just
a
touch
of
citric
hops
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
slightly
dry
finish
classic
low
quality
mexican
lager
probably
no
better
and
no
worse
then
the
others
something
i
tried
once
but
wont
buy
again
in
the
future
prost
back
in
the
late
70s
when
i
lived
in
southern
california
tecate
was
a
favorite
beer
it
was
malty
with
a
slightly
bitter
kick
my
mexicanamerican
girlfriend
who
became
my
wife
taught
me
to
drink
it
from
the
can
and
squeezing
a
lime
onto
the
rim
on
many
a
visit
to
mexico
we
would
enjoy
tecate
with
limes
after
moving
back
to
the
east
coast
i
would
always
keep
cans
of
tecate
around
to
enjoy
with
mexican
food
recently
it
seems
to
have
changed
to
a
hoppier
formulation
that
has
less
malt
probably
due
to
the
use
of
the
more
cost
effective
hop
extract
most
commercial
north
american
brewers
have
adopted
as
a
substitute
to
using
real
hops
in
any
case
we
have
stopped
drinking
tecate
and
switched
to
other
smoother
adjunct
lagers
same
old
song

dance
kinda

something
else

i

i
would
have
it
again
depending
upon
what
else
was
served
and
perhaps
the
food
as
a
beer
i
want
to
say
it
is
perhaps
a

too
watery
so
it
leaves
me
to
say
just
average
altogether
light

theres
plenty

coming
craft

but
this
was
one
of
the
worst
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
type
im
trying
to
rate
these
more

will
probably
go

overall
this
was
pretty
bad
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
great
but
its
at
least
mildly
drinkable
pretty
standard
beer
in
my
opinion
doesnt
taste
much
different
than
a
pabst
except
for
the
addition
of
some
metallic
flavor
im
not
a
beer
snob
i
typically
review
beers
based
on
how
successful
they
would
be
at
a
party
and
everybody
seemed
to
like
this
with
no
negative
comments
however
it
didnt
wow
anybody
nothing
great
but
its
worth
a
try
if
you
want
something
from
the
usual
overall
not
the
worst
mexican
brew
no
sharp
or
harsh
edges
not
too
corny
or
sugary
some
fair
balance
a
worthy
option
when
options
are
limited
a
good
alternative
to
tap
water
while
on
vacation
down
south
but
i
wouldnt
bother
otherwise

sugar

taste
is
pretty

and
like
the

is
watery
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
all
around
with
nothing
that
would
make
me
try
this
one
again
not
great
or
even
average
taste
similarly
is

mildly
sweet

good

pretty
fair
example
of
an

which
may
or
may
not
be

much
i
added
the

to
the

why
not

that
good
if
you
are
looking
for

mexican
version
of
bmc
just
another
macro
brew
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
can
be
gulped
as
easily
as
it
is
sipped
the
body
is
light
and
playful
allowing
the
flavors
to
come
through
while
keeping
good
drinkability
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
less
fizzy
than
some
other
beers
in
this
category
which
actually
adds
to
the
experience
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
not
worth
saying
too
much
about
reviewed
mostly
so
i
remember
not
to
try
this
again
overall
i
would
give
it
an
average
score
but
the
appearance
is
so
disappointing
that
im
going
to
mark
it
just
below
average
ya
know
what
as
the
mexican
cheapos
go
i
like
tecate
its
been
described
by
my
flatmate
wilson
as
mexican
gatorade
and
with
a
lime
wedge
dropped
right
in
the
can
i
agree
smells
like
a
crappy
lager
nothing
else
flavor
though
isnt
bad
some
mild
malts
in
their
watered
down
form
and
i
guess
the
balance
in
there
is
hops
but
its
nothing
distinguishable
mouthfeel
is
its
savior
light
and
well
carbonated
its
just
right
sometimes
either
when
you
are
traveling
in
the
southwest
on
a
budget
or
its
just
flat
out
hot
outside
it
has
a
role
to
play
in
the
beer
world
and
for
that
i
keep
it
on
the
island
say
what
you
will
light
gold
with
a
monstrous
head
that
left
in
seconds
leaving
about
two
spots
of
lace
the
aroms
is
of
sweet
corn
and
faint
malts
the
hops
are
somewhere
in
that
mix
the
flavor
leaves
you
with
the
same
impression
the
body
is
watery
and
thin
ok
lawn
mower
beer
o
its
difficult
to
differentiate
the
flavours
from
the
traditional
corona
import
im
used
to
nothing
spectacular
here
just
an
easy
drinking
tropical
destination
bevy
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
tecate
and
my
expectations
were
set
appropriately
for
an
adjunct
lager
theres
nothing
really
offensive
about
this
beer
and
its
easy
to
drink
but
in
the
end
its
just
a
average
americanmexican
style
beer
that
has
nothing
going
for
it
dont
get
this
playa
wrong
it
wuznt
terrible
but
damn
not
my
first
choice
o
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
good
on
a
real
hot
day
with
some
food
i
would
not
go
out
to
buy
this
beer
but
would
drink
it
when
choices
are
limited
i
would
like
to
try
a
couple
when
its
90
out
and
humid
and
see
if
that
if
an
influence
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
the
mexican
lager
beers
and
think
there
will
be
better
to
experience
give
it
a
try
on
a
warm
day
o
the
beer
is
not
that
bad
compared
to
others
in
the
style
particularly
if
it
is
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
i
find
this
beer
to
be
best
with
lime
and
some
salt
around
the
edge
great
with
anything
spice
and
mexican
but
as
far
as
beers
go
by
itself
is
pretty
poor
overall
this
is
a
terrible
beer
to
review
in
a
pint
glass
its
not
skunky
like
corona
so
i
can
drink
this
out
of
the
can
in
the
right
situation
adding
lime
and
salt
on
the
can
is
the
way
to
go
with
this
one
allegedly
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
something
i
need
to
drink
more
of
to
get
a
good
hadle
on
but
definetly
think
this
beer
is
worth
trying
o
more
expensive
than
cheap
american
lager
bottom
line
if
you
like
golden
lagers
of
any
kind
try
tecate
you
might
enjoy
this
nice
mexican
brew
overall
id
take
corona
its
not
a
horrible
macro
its
malty
heavy
and
skunky
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
but
i
wouldnt
buy
unless
i
was
in
mexico
or
it
was
the
best
beer
available
which
is
the
case
here
better
than
bud
but
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
carona
ive
had
so
much
tecate
over
the
years
by
itself
and
in
micheladas
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
it
on
this
site
so
better
late
than
never
for
the
style
and
price
it
cant
be
beat
definately
have
it
in
a
can
or
cold
glass
but
not
a
glass
bottle
much
better
than
overhyped
dos
equis
lager
and
you
probably
wont
touch
corona
or
sol
again
o
i
bought
it
once
and
will
never
have
it
again
my
buddy
told
me
to
try
it
because
it
was
good
but
my
goodness
it
was
bad
i
dont
get
how
people
love
this
stuff
overall
this
is
a
pretty
crappy
beer
bought
a
1
can
just
to
try
it
so
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
d
a
very
average
industrial
lager
the
corny
character
is
noticeable
but
not
particularly
unpleasant
and
the
aroma
is
agreeable
due
to
some
light
notes
of
malt
and
floral
hops
it
certainly
beats
skunky
corona
with
a
lime
had
this
beer
while
in
mexico
for
the
baja
race
omg
this
is
worse
than
coors
nothing
but
carb
water
and
a
touch
of
hop
and
grains
that
just
get
choked
down
by
the
patron
we
were
drinkin
as
well
would
never
drink
this
state
side
as
my
would
be
wasted
on
a
drainpour
final
grade

a
c
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
just
what
i
need
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
miserable
winter
day
or
just
whenever
im
craving
a
tecate
certainly
nothing
to
excite
even
the
lager
lover
but
in
a
mexican
restaurant
faced
with
the
full
range
of
lites
this
is
not
a
bad
option
oa
very
easy
drinking
and
not
terrible
beer
as
far
as
lighter
beers
go
this
is
awesome
its
not
a
kick
in
the
mouth
but
its
great
when
you
dont
feel
like
getting
your
taste
buds
raped
light
crisp
refreshingish
like
club
soda
tastes
like
lime
if
you
squeeze
a
lime
in
it
i
pick
up
flavors
of
plastic
from
the
serving
cup
theres
a
muted
honey
sweet
note
on
the
otherwise
unremarkable
finish
eh
ill
drink
it
if
its
there
and
my
only
other
choices
are
bmclonestar
this
is
texas
after
all
but
i
could
easily
never
ever
have
this
again
and
not
miss
it
for
mexican
independence
day
liberate
yourself
from
crappy
import
lagers
and
drink
something
with
real
flavor
viva
mexico
tecattteee
o
sweet
light
and
easy
to
drink
more
importantly
this
beer
doesnt
taste
like
gross
stale
water
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
in
a
pinch
this
is
a
better
alternative
to
most
overall
not
a
bad
mexican
lager
overall
nat
a
good
beer
for
anything
but
slamming
a
few
at
a
party
or
something
would
never
sit
down
to
sip
on
a
tecate
for
the
taste
thats
for
sure
overallwhen
i
have
a
hankering
for
an
inexpensive
6
pack
out
of
a
can
tecate
will
continue
to
be
a
go
to
for
me
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
im
surprised
how
little
i
like
this
before
writing
this
review
ive
already
had
half
a
case
of
these
while
in
the
pool
this
week
and
i
enjoyed
them
all
quite
thoroughly
moral
of
the
story
i
guess
keep
the
beer
in
the
can
put
the
can
in
a
coozy
o
not
too
bad
for
the
style
i
would
prefer
this
over
some
of
the
adjunct
lagers
brewed
in
the
us
although
it
still
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
poured
a
12
ounce
can
into
a
frosted
mug
at
a
local
mexican
restaurant
i
had
to
request
the
mug
they
were
out
of
the
draft
version
it
was
not
easy
to
see
the
color
but
it
was
a
pale
yellow
with
a
mild
head
of
foam
this
was
a
mild
lager
with
no
noticeable
aroma
of
corn
the
flavor
was
had
a
mild
bite
of
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
i
enjoyed
the
beer
i
skipped
the
lime
mediocre
but
better
than
most
adjunct
lagers
a
red
16oz
can
a
decent
lager
especially
when
compared
to
corona
and
dos
equis
slightly
fuller
bodied
and
more
flavorful
than
the
others
this
tastes
like
a
real
beer
and
not
like
cold
carbonated
piss
this
is
the
cheap
summer
beach
beer
for
the
masses
while
not
the
best
mexican
beer
its
good
for
drinking
on
the
beach
or
by
the
pool
id
take
this
over
the
dominant
brand
of
mexican
beer
every
time
crystal
clear
and
pale
yellow
in
colour
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
disappeared
fast
somewhat
sweet
in
aroma
a
bit
of
cereal
slight
spiciness
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
were
mild
and
there
was
a
fruity
character
to
it
light
mineral
finish
more
body
than
i
expected
certainly
not
thin
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
edged
towards
soft
rather
than
crisp
and
aggressive
quite
dry
while
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
it
was
mostly
inoffensive
and
fairly
drinkable
pretty
decent
when
compared
to
others
in
the
style
tecate
as
in
most
mexican
beers
taste
best
in
teh
summer
with
a
lime
however
judging
tecate
solo
its
just
another
no
frills
cerveza
the
beer
poors
golden
clear
with
good
carbonation
that
give
a
white
foamy
head
for
a
brief
time
the
smell
and
taste
are
enhanced
with
grain
the
hops
help
somewhat
with
teh
taste
so
that
it
is
not
bread
water
mouthfeel
is
easy
especially
on
hot
days
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
partylawnmower
beer
in
every
aspect
simply
a
cheap
and
not
bad
tasting
beer
that
goes
with
most
food
overall
i
dont
know
why
i
reviewed
this
other
than
everyone
at
work
telling
me
how
great
it
is
it
isnt
the
initial
reaction
reminded
me
of
a
typical
american
style
lager
light
somewhat
watery
i
didnt
get
a
lot
from
the
sniff
test
and
after
later
sampling
the
same
beer
in
a
glass
the
color
confirmed
my
thoughts
very
light
in
color
with
a
tint
of
amber
but
more
yellowish
when
it
was
ice
cold
i
wasnt
totally
disappointed
and
in
its
defense
its
hard
to
keep
a
beer
that
supposed
to
be
cold
well
cold
when
its
90
degrees
overall
in
taste
i
put
it
slightly
above
sol
very
similar
but
below
corona
and
modelo
booze
delivery
system
cheap
and
hardly
with
it
not
a
lot
going
on
here
no
big
surprise
but
as
expected
it
matched
with
the
food
just
fine
i
e
didnt
mess
with
the
simple
and
pleasurable
south
of
the
border
cafeteriastyle
offerings
especially
once
i
went
with
natch
the
top
end
of
the
spicy
salsa
spectrum
same
deal
as
years
ago
slamming
this
back
in
a
more
or
less
equivalent
joint
in
downtown
las
vegas
for
a
buck
a
beer
at
the
time
as
much
as
the
taste
improves
that
nose
is
just
disgusting
and
id
grab
something
else
before
having
this
thing
it
is
very
easy
drinking
i
must
admit
but
real
sweet
too
overall
not
my
favorite
mexican
lager
its
ok
though
flavor
thats
fine
ill
keep
my
flavor
overall
why
waste
money
on
this
skip
it
o
its
not
bad
but
nothing
special
a
cheap
beer
that
comes
in
cans
easy
enough
to
get
when
in
mexico
and
overall
middle
of
the
road
for
easy
to
get
mexican
beers
special
thanks
to
the
iris
interns
for
donating
this
to
me
this
is
a
stereotypical
americanstyle
lager
of
which
im
partial
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
very
clear
golden
color
carbonation
is
high
the
aroma
had
a
slightly
off
grain
smell
that
i
was
unable
to
place
but
as
i
drank
it
it
was
not
as
prominent
in
the
glass
the
taste
is
okay
with
a
decent
barleygrainhop
balance
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
and
it
finishes
crisp
and
refreshing
certainly
this
is
an
ordinary
type
beer
but
id
say
its
as
good
as
other
runofthemill
lagers
i
think
you
should
try
it
i
drank
this
sample
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
likely
better
from
the
can
where
the
weak
aroma
is
not
a
factor
and
the
carbonation
would
stick
around
a
bit
longer
overall
dont
mind
it
its
not
skunked
id
have
again
if
its
the
only
thing
there
overall
perhaps
a
decent
lawnomower
beer
but
certainly
not
one
to
purchase
for
the
love
of
beer
itself
had
a
couple
of
these
icecold
and
i
do
mean
icecold
out
of
the
cooler
after
a
recent
backpacking
trip
and
they
were
delicious
i
am
admittedly
biased
towards
refreshing
beers
over
heavier
beers
though
and
love
me
some
cervezas
mexicanas
as
well
perhaps
because
i
am
a
southern
california
guy
at
any
rate
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
many
occasions
the
ballpark
after
a
hike
or
to
wash
down
a
meal
disfrutalo
overall
another
beer
to
file
under
the
lawnmower
category
this
would
be
pretty
refreshing
in
95
degree
heat
but
thats
about
all
it
has
going
for
it
not
worth
the
import
price
of
13
a
12
pack
there
are
plenty
of
equal
alternatives
for
a
better
price
overall
its
not
bad
not
something
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
but
if
im
somewhere
out
and
thats
all
they
have
sure
i
would
drink
it
another
fine
choice
on
the
mini
tour
at
old
chicago
poured
the
typical
yellow
fizzy
stuff
with
little
head
no
aroma
and
again
too
sweet
of
malt
i
guess
swet
corn
malt
is
a
must
have
for
these
brews
not
offensive
but
again
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
ill
keep
doing
the
mini
tours
to
keep
the
shirts
going
since
92
but
it
smells
like
metallic
cheap
cereal
grains
it
tastes
a
bit
metallic
and
a
bit
like
cheap
wet
cereal
grain
it
isnt
sweet
at
all
it
has
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
even
so
thats
a
plus
but
overall
its
not
very
good
id
consider
sol
to
be
better
this
is
a
lot
like
busch
but
more
bitter
and
with
a
bit
more
flavour
yeah
look
it
is
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
is
bad
beer
much
like
any
other
traditional
lager
minimal
color
taste
and
quality
poured
into
a
glass
and
watched
the
head
disappear
rather
quickly
the
aroma
of
malts
are
there
but
not
much
else
its
got
a
nice
drinkable
body
to
it
but
still
nothing
overly
impressive
watery
very
light
poured
from
a
can
while
at
a
resort
in
mexico
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellowgold
color
with
thick
bubbly
white
head
that
vanished
quickly
smells
a
bit
musty
with
slight
sour
tones
malt
and
corn
the
beer
is
light
round
and
crisp
in
mouth
with
toasted
oat
and
malty
flavors
aftertaste
is
musty
and
lingers
a
bit
it
leaves
a
slight
film
in
mouth
nothing
remarkable
but
when
in
rome
goes
down
with
the
sounds
of
brazilian
jazz
artist
airto
moreira
and
flora
purim
i
poured
a
12
oz
can
into
a
clear
plastic
cup
the
beer
was
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
pretty
big
white
head
smells
like
grains
and
corn
with
as
hint
of
lime
tastes
kind
of
salty
mettalic
and
bready
the
beer
is
watery
it
is
refreshing
in
the
heat
drinks
like
water
so
over
all
i
think
tecate
beer
is
very
good
and
pretty
smooth
i
really
liked
the
flavor
and
i
thought
the
beer
was
strong
enough
to
give
me
a
nice
buzz
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
market
if
you
have
not
tried
it
yet
go
get
a
pack
they
are
worth
the
money
long
live
tecate
beer
after
2
beers
of
doing
this
the
feeling
is
lost
so
go
to
drinking
it
straight
or
better
yet
go
to
drinking
something
stronger
drink
nothing
special
here
but
also
nothing
offensive
for
the
price
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
you
could
do
worse
for
sure
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
very
little
lacing
smells
of
corn
and
hay
and
a
little
sweetness
tastes
much
the
same
some
corn
hay
and
some
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
okay
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
medium
its
not
the
worst
of
its
style
d
very
drinkable
if
u
dont
mind
it
being
pretty
much
flavorless
for
the
style
it
aint
terrible

slight
scents
of
grain
and
malts
has
a
very
light
taste
with
the
only
main
elements
that
i
can
pick
out
are
grassy
grains
and
some
malts
very
silmilar
as
cheap
mass
produced
domestic
beer
something
new
to
try
if
you
havent
had
it
before
but
no
taste
here
as
it
is
very
bland
drinkability
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
its
like
12
bux
a
12
pk
i
can
buy
something
better
for
less
drinkability
selected
this
with
a
mexican
meal
it
did
not
pair
well
with
the
spiciness
boring
beer
overall
d
easily
chugged
d
drinkable
to
be
sure
but
i
dont
really
want
another
one
any
time
soon
one
finger
snow
white
head
lace
broken
and
little
cling
color
is
a
5
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
of
wet
corn
and
malt
taste
is
of
corn
and
malt
much
water
feel
in
my
mouth
this
beer
was
given
to
me
by
a
friend
and
i
doubt
i
would
ever
pay
good
money
for
another
d
low
abv
and
easy
to
drink
by
not
much
here
pretty
average
overall
served
with
lime
and
salt
its
fine
for
mexican
food
but
mostly
the
additions
make
it
taste
like
salty
limes
interesting
session
though
cheers
side
notesgrowing
up
mexican
in
southern
california
ive
drank
this
beer
alot
if
you
can
get
it
in
mexico
its
better
its
probably
best
served
ice
cold
and
with
some
lime
and
salt
andor
chilie
powder
beware
if
you
drink
too
many
of
these
they
can
deal
a
hangover
that
can
make
you
throw
things
up
that
you
ate
in
high
school
i
kept
seeing
this
on
the
shelf
at
the
liquor
store
and
didnt
know
what
it
was
instead
of
looking
it
up
decided
to
pick
it
up
to
give
it
a
try
pours
an
almost
clear
pale
yellow
colour
with
fairly
big
white
head
that
dissipates
leaving
almost
half
an
inch
some
spotty
lacing
smells
a
bit
off
vegetables
and
grains
flavour
is
almost
nonexistent
i
may
as
well
be
drinking
carbonated
water
i
suppose
the
carbonation
level
is
actually
quite
nice
basically
the
beer
is
nice
to
look
at
and
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
everything
else
about
it
is
pretty
bad
d
this
was
always
my
least
favorite
of
the
mexican
lagers
that
id
had
and
this
can
reminds
me
why
just
no
good
d
since
ive
moved
on
to
better
beer
at
the
most
id
have
to
slam
down
this
stuff
when
its
really
cold
although
its
better
than
budweiser
coors
and
pabst
d
although
not
the
most
impressive
beer
around
itd
make
an
ok
at
best
beach
beer
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
any
other
occasion
after
the
initial
review
i
went
with
the
fresh
lime
squeezedrubbed
on
the
lip
of
the
can
and
sprinkled
with
sea
salt
ala
tony
bordain
it
was
really
refreshing
though
i
cant
give
bonus
points
for
a
beer
making
a
good
cocktail
it
went
really
well
with
tacos
doused
in
habanero
salsa
they
serve
this
a
lot
in
rosarito
mexico
which
is
the
first
place
i
ever
had
it
now
years
later
i
still
enjoy
it
from
time
to
time
as
my
go
to
pale
yellow
mexican
lager
its
not
bad
by
any
respect
but
certainly
isnt
gonna
blow
you
away
its
pale
yellow
fizzy
and
tastes
like
corn
not
offensive
like
some
other
mexican
brews
ahem
corona
ahem
good
for
washing
down
some
beef
jerky
which
is
what
im
using
it
for
right
now
or
a
home
cooked
mexican
meal
this
beer
is
not
just
simply
good
but
very
enjoyable
as
a
light
beer
d
highly
drinkinable
nothing
more
than
a
good
easy
to
drink
beer
with
spicy
food
really
no
dimension
pours
an
almost
clear
golden
straw
color
with
cap
of
frothy
head
gone
quickly
with
no
lacing
scent
is
of
musty
grass
hint
of
mildew
taste
does
not
improve
on
the
qualities
of
scent
much
musty
and
grassy
with
no
real
hints
of
good
ingredients
light
bodied
overly
carbonated
a
poor
aa
lager
it
is
easy
to
drink
though
i
grew
up
drinking
tecate
in
my
family
so
maybe
thats
why
i
think
its
not
the
worst
beer
out
there
i
like
the
taste
of
it
when
its
nice
and
cold
in
a
bottle
and
to
make
it
way
better
add
lime
and
salt
plus
its
really
not
that
expinsive
to
buy
just
give
it
a
chance
youll
end
up
liking
it
i
guess
with
some
spicy
food
or
a
hot
day
it
would
be
doable
but
for
your
average
session
i
would
pass
i
will
admit
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
in
the
bottom
list
i
have
had
much
worse
pretty
darn
boring
to
say
the
least
icecold
tecate
is
a
useful
utility
in
certain
situations
but
do
yourself
a
favor
suck
ice
and
leave
this
for
the
beezies
that
is
the
insect
variety
they
effing
love
this
stuff
trust
me
your
spring
break
experience
will
be
much
better
for
it
usual
mouthfeel
for
the
style
and
its
fairly
drinkable
and
when
i
say
that
i
mean
when
its
good
and
cold
i
dont
want
something
like
this
to
warm
up
i
might
have
this
again
if
it
were
free
and
i
was
in
a
hot
and
sweaty
cantina
w
no
ventilation
nonetheless
senior
tecate
i
see
no
reason
to
converse
with
you
anytime
soon
not
even
over
chips
and
salsa
adios
i
will
never
buy
this
stuff
ever
again
i
would
rather
drink
corona
lets
face
it
this
beer
wont
be
winning
any
awards
any
time
soon
however
for
a
beer
to
quaff
during
the
summer
it
fits
the
bill
d
average
drinkability
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
likely
why
they
are
cheap
and
inexpensive
way
too
pricey
for
what
it
brings
to
the
table
d
not
bad
for
an
adjunct
better
than
corona
id
say
one
must
always
remember
to
rate
to
the
style
so
while
this
beer
may
not
be
great
for
an
adjunct
its
tolerable
enough
cheers
overallnotes
drank
this
last
night
while
sitting
on
the
balcony
looking
out
to
the
ocean
it
was
a
pleasant
overall
feeling
as
an
american
adjunct
this
gets
the
job
done
just
fine
certainly
more
acceptable
than
corona
a
million
poets
working
for
a
million
years
could
still
only
describe
but
three
eights
of
this
beers
repulsiveness
it
completely
eclipses
anything
bad
that
has
ever
been
said
about
corona
feel
free
to
recognize
the
things
written
here
as
just
my
own
opinions
but
heed
them
as
warnings
and
proceed
to
ignore
them
at
your
own
risk
drinkability
potable
but
not
enjoyable
perhaps
this
beer
is
better
in
the
extreme
heat
of
mexico
d
given
its
status
as
a
cheapass
macro
swill
brew
by
mexicans
and
its
whats
that
factor
amongst
your
friends
at
a
mexican
joint
you
cant
be
faulted
for
going
there
ive
seen
it
cheap
enough
for
sixers
in
stores
where
id
get
it
over
corona
to
bring
to
a
mexicantheme
party
or
something
but
the
buck
stops
there
fine
for
what
it
is
the
mexican
high
life
d
it
goes
down
just
nice
but
still
the
taste
factor
isnt
there
d
not
great
here
but
that
is
what
i
was
expecting
you
dont
buy
tecate
for
classy
refined
enjoyment
its
a
hot
day
gulper
thats
about
it
drinkability
blehh
this
beer
is
terrible
i
would
actually
rather
drink
american
light
macro
swill
than
this
abomination
this
beer
clearly
serves
only
one
purpose
inebriation
dont
even
bother
there
are
bettertasting
beers
to
get
drunk
on
d
tecate
is
definitely
an
easydrinker
but
i
wouldnt
say
that
the
drinkability
is
very
high
since
i
think
i
could
get
the
same
flavor
by
blending
a
shot
of
vodka
a
piece
of
cornbread
and
tonic
water
maybe
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
scorching
hot
summer
day
floating
the
river
but
aside
from
that
this
beer
has
no
purpose
d
unappealing
and
lackluster
beer
its
tough
enough
just
to
get
through
one
bottle
a
few
shades
darker
than
a
typical
strawcolored
adjunct
lager
thing
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
smells
very
light
of
corn
and
grass
and
hardly
any
hopsmalt
taste
is
light
and
watery
but
somewhat
bitter
in
a
way
not
reminiscent
of
hops
carbonation
makes
it
a
bit
tougher
to
drink
when
it
overpowers
nearly
any
beer
flavor
it
has
but
the
corn
and
vegetablegrass
flavors
are
still
ther
it
isnt
an
offensive
taste
just
very
light
and
wholly
unimpressive
i
was
reluctant
to
finish
one
while
drinking
it
without
food
though
it
seems
like
it
could
be
a
decent
beer
to
accompany
some
spicier
foods
it
just
lacks
good
flavors
of
its
own
pouring
a
light
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head
with
decent
retention
this
looks
acceptably
good
no
real
lace
though
the
nose
is
rather
bad
vegies
and
corn
this
has
no
hop
character
none
expected
no
malt
just
nothing
but
some
corn
and
vegies
the
palate
is
the
same
and
arguably
worse
vegies
corn
and
watery
thin
with
no
flavor
of
any
significance
and
an
awful
watery
finish
with
a
lingering
nastiness
i
could
not
drink
more
than
2
sips
of
this
overall
this
beer
isnt
anything
special
id
say
its
just
another
macro
lager
felt
good
on
draft
at
my
local
mexican
restaurant
decided
to
pick
up
a
12
at
kroger
for
11
99
chilled
for
about
5
hours
with
my
budweiser
good
beer
a
good
complement
to
chips
pretzels
and
even
shrimp
took
a
moment
to
get
past
the
smell
but
after
that
good
clean
and
drinkable
beats
corona
by
a
longshot
picked
up
a
six
pack
for
an
impromptu
cinco
de
mayo
dinner
at
my
house
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pale
yellow
colored
body
quick
fizzy
head
quietly
faded
fast
surprisingly
there
was
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
was
not
really
there
at
all
flavor
has
mostly
just
an
adjunct
lager
corn
and
malt
were
the
only
real
discernible
flavors
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
very
watery
though
it
was
pretty
smooth
going
down
and
it
didnt
have
a
skunky
or
boring
mexican
beer
flavor
actually
tasted
like
a
fresh
lager
so
ill
rate
the
drinkability
a
bit
higher
went
nicely
with
a
meal
of
grilled
chicken
fajitas
since
this
six
pack
was
almost
a
1
cheaper
than
other
south
of
the
border
options
it
was
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
drinkability
would
drink
again
considering
it
is
a
cheap
import
beer
d
i
would
consider
this
the
coors
of
mexico
nothing
i
want
to
consume
again
reallybut
if
you
are
only
looking
to
quench
your
thirst
perhaps
this
would
do
it
has
nothing
to
really
separate
it
from
the
legions
of
other
mass
produced
lagers
imo
thin
and
grainy
drinkability
is
ok
not
really
meant
to
be
anything
more
than
a
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
even
though
hefeweizens
or
witbiers
would
be
the
refreshing
beers
of
choice
for
me
beer
has
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
light
head
and
moderate
carbonation
smell
was
a
generic
bland
taste
was
light
and
refreshing
the
finish
was
a
bit
watery
and
went
down
easy
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
minus
the
lemon
of
course
and
the
price
is
also
a
factor
mexican
beer
should
only
be
compared
to
mexican
beer
when
a
countrys
water
has
the
reputation
that
mexicos
has
one
shouldnt
expect
the
beer
thats
produced
there
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
other
beers
from
around
the
world
that
being
said
this
is
the
salt
and
lime
beer
they
go
down
like
water
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
cant
walk
much
less
drive
good
for
getting
wasted
but
thats
about
it
pours
a
very
transparent
light
straw
with
just
a
bit
of
fizzy
head
can
see
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
smell
is
not
particularly
strong
its
the
usual
grainy
mexican
beer
smell
taste
is
beerflavored
sort
of
carbonation
is
very
forward
a
little
bit
of
malt
in
the
aftertaste
and
in
the
middle
it
might
as
well
be
seltzer
all
told
theres
nothing
to
offend
because
theres
really
not
much
of
anything
at
all
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
i
guess
but
thats
about
all
its
got
going
for
it
that
and
price
its
the
only
import
going
for
less
than
66pack
at
my
local
supermarket
tastes
pretty
good
especially
with
a
homemade
bean
and
cheese
tostada
d
extreme
thirst
or
a
party
would
both
be
incentives
to
drink
this
stuff
and
its
thin
body
and
lack
of
flavor
lend
it
refreshing
qualities
i
see
why
people
add
a
lime
but
on
that
note
id
prefer
a
corona
d
i
dont
think
ill
ever
be
able
to
drink
more
than
two
ounces
at
a
time
of
this
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
just
your
run
of
the
mill
macro
lager
i
can
barely
tell
the
difference
between
tecate
and
other
brews
of
the
style
including
dos
equis
not
worth
it
if
youre
going
to
drink
it
do
it
quickly
and
make
sure
its
cold
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
seconds
into
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
grassy
and
floral
hops
for
an
adjunct
lager
this
is
actually
a
really
nice
aroma
and
has
solid
complexity
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
a
little
milder
there
is
still
nice
complexity
but
it
would
be
nice
if
it
came
out
a
little
more
as
it
did
in
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
it
has
a
lot
more
complexity
and
flavor
that
most
beers
in
its
style
and
it
very
easy
drinking
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
why
is
it
the
more
beers
you
sample
the
worse
a
certain
beer
gets
a
few
years
ago
tecate
tasted
fine
did
they
change
the
recipe
once
they
merged
or
have
my
taste
buds
grown
and
developed
perhaps
its
a
bit
of
both
there
is
a
definite
mexican
taste
in
the
beers
finish
somewhat
similar
to
corona
but
more
pronounced
it
is
the
finish
that
saves
this
beer
from
just
being
another
miller
or
budweiser
on
a
hot
day
it
is
drinkable
especially
after
youve
had
too
many
to
care
what
you
are
drinking
pouring
it
out
of
a
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
brings
out
more
flavor
highly
suggested
that
you
do
not
drink
it
straight
from
a
can
had
the
beer
in
mexico
in
a
bottle
a
few
years
back
and
it
seemed
to
taste
better
again
recipe
change
bottle
vs
can
who
knows
at
least
it
isnt
as
pricey
as
it
used
to
be
light
and
smooth
on
the
palate
more
bland
malt
on
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
this
beer
has
a
certain
stale
quality
to
it
that
i
did
not
enjoy
probably
will
not
drink
again
a
pleasant
surprise
is
that
the
body
is
a
wee
bit
fuller
than
expected
drinkability
is
typical
it
just
flows
right
down
the
throat
if
you
dont
approach
this
brew
with
any
great
expectations
you
wont
be
disappointed
not
bad
when
drunk
cold
mostly
can
pick
up
barley
malt
flavor
with
some
cornyness
no
hops
to
speak
of
lots
of
carbonation
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
cloying
well
simply
put
its
a
run
of
the
mill
cheap
drinkable
beer
its
light
not
much
head
to
it
on
the
pour
if
any
at
all
i
put
lime
and
salt
in
it
to
add
to
the
flavor
wouldnt
drink
it
without
the
two
i
prefer
this
to
corona
which
i
hate
i
could
drink
these
if
i
wanted
to
get
drunk
and
not
drink
bmc
i
would
call
this
a
classy
college
beer
lol
simply
put
if
going
for
a
mexican
beer
i
prefer
this
to
corona
i
am
still
putting
modelo
and
negra
modelo
as
my
preferred
mexican
beers
but
tecate
will
do
in
a
pinch
i
prefer
mine
with
a
bunch
of
lime
and
a
touch
of
salt
chelada
style
it
hides
the
mediocre
beer
that
inhabits
this
can
had
this
at
some
tavern
on
the
lower
east
side
got
it
as
a
special
a
shot
of
tequila
and
a
can
of
tecate
appearance
is
a
straw
colour
and
both
the
smell
and
taste
are
citrusy
somewhat
better
than
your
average
adjunct
lager
however
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
light
if
i
was
in
a
warmer
climate
and
i
had
a
choice
between
this
and
bmc
i
would
take
the
tecate
but
i
greatly
prefer
a
bohemia
a
negra
modelo
or
even
a
carta
blanca
i
dont
feel
regret
leaving
beers
like
this
behind
and
next
time
i
see
one
of
these
in
a
fridge
curiosity
will
not
tempt
me
again
but
i
dont
find
it
as
horrible
as
some
seem
to
although
ill
admit
i
only
finished
enough
to
complete
the
review
id
put
in
on
par
with
pbr
which
seems
to
get
love
on
this
site
for
reasons
i
dont
understand
d
i
wound
up
running
into
another
beer
nerd
at
the
party
and
he
told
me
this
was
his
favorite
of
all
the
macros
i
havent
had
any
in
years
but
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
macros
was
that
they
are
flavorless
not
actually
bad
ordered
a
bottle
for
3
at
papa
gallo
and
poured
it
into
a
pilsner
glass
this
clear
gold
lager
had
a
distinct
roasted
corn
and
husk
flavor
which
isnt
offputting
but
isnt
the
most
pleasant
taste
i
give
this
brew
credit
for
actually
having
flavor
and
at
3
for
a
decent
restaurant
its
also
not
a
bad
option
between
tequila
drinks
the
aroma
is
light
hops
and
a
lot
of
skunk
the
taste
is
basically
the
same
the
mouthfeel
is
less
than
water
is
that
possible
drinkable
is
ok
but
whats
the
point
with
the
abv
d
if
someone
serves
this
absurdly
cold
it
might
be
palatable
i
just
dont
know
if
you
could
get
it
that
cold
without
freezing
it
altogether
dlow
wouldnt
even
be
good
on
the
beach
didnt
finish
this
one
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
its
pretty
average
in
every
way
i
envision
this
as
the
mexicanmans
budweiser
nothing
remarkable
but
nothing
truly
offensive
pale
light
yellow
with
minimal
head
no
real
strong
smell
to
pick
up
other
than
some
hints
of
corn
and
malt
taste
is
soso
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
boring
its
drinkable
but
i
wasnt
impressed
at
all
d
i
cant
even
say
this
is
good
in
a
pinch
since
there
are
at
least
three
other
beers
i
would
pick
over
it
and
which
are
cheaper
drinkability
sadly
the
overall
nastiness
of
the
flavor
brings
the
drinkability
way
down
sure
its
a
light
lager
suitable
for
outdoor
work
but
damn
it
just
aint
good
d
well
its
light
and
crisp
but
then
again
it
also
tastes
terrible
so
drinkability
is
not
very
good
would
not
turn
one
down
but
not
worth
the
money
to
keep
stocked
in
the
fridge
lost
my
detailed
notes
on
this
one
suffice
to
say
this
is
below
average
beer
even
by
mexican
beer
standards
started
off
nice
with
a
clear
yellow
color
and
an
impressive
bit
of
head
with
even
more
impressive
retention
but
that
was
the
best
of
it
smell
was
sweet
full
of
corn
and
grains
and
the
taste
was
no
better
just
more
sweet
corn
rice
straw
and
grains
in
general
lighter
body
with
heavy
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
decent
mexican
lager
goes
down
easy
and
is
refreshing
surprisingly
poor
especially
now
that
this
popularly
sells
at
the
same
price
point
as
the
regular
bmc
crowd
i
love
my
mexican
friends
but
this
only
sells
because
they
slap
a
mexican
flag
on
it
had
it
at
uncle
julio
in
virginia
it
was
the
closest
beer
to
water
beats
even
fosters
lager
had
to
migrate
to
negra
after
this
medium
carbonation
and
amazing
waterlike
mouthfeel
and
tatse
only
good
part
is
that
you
can
keep
chugging
at
it
without
feeling
a
thing
i
guess
not
too
bad
if
served
ice
cold
with
a
plate
of
greasy
mexican
food
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
after
all
it
is
pretty
light
but
the
taste
isnt
good
enough
to
make
me
want
a
lot
nothing
special
but
extremely
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
i
hinted
my
feelings
about
it
above
its
the
right
beer
with
mexican
maybe
the
only
one
in
my
book
but
outside
that
class
of
food
there
are
better
d
i
find
this
one
really
easy
to
drink
and
dont
mind
it
at
all
on
a
hot
day
or
when
im
eating
junk
and
watching
tv
it
doesnt
taste
particularly
good
but
its
definately
not
bad
and
tastes
better
than
water
not
a
bad
thirst
quenching
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
body
with
a
dry
finish
tecate
this
is
a
good
mexican
lager
for
a
hot
day
drank
it
from
the
can
just
like
when
i
was
on
a
mexican
beach
golden
color
minimal
head
lots
of
carbonation
and
often
served
with
a
lime
and
some
salt
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
adding
any
lime
and
salt
to
any
beer
so
i
didnt
get
any
topping
its
a
thirst
quenching
beer
but
dont
perfer
it
when
there
are
so
many
other
great
mexican
beers
d
definitely
better
than
corona
imo
not
bad
stuff
better
than
most
other
adjuncts
d
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
and
will
probably
stay
away
from
it
in
the
future
d
this
beer
is
incredibly
bland
and
watery
if
your
looking
for
crap
mexican
beer
there
are
much
better
alternatives
its
not
offensive
in
anyway
just
very
boring
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
aroma
is
very
mild
some
hints
of
corn
taste
is
also
mild
some
corn
and
malt
flavors
feels
light
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
average
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
brew
notes
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
t
kind
of
watery
it
has
a
graincorn
kind
of
taste
to
it
but
really
nothing
there
no
real
taste
that
jumps
out
but
its
not
bad
and
is
probably
my
favorite
mass
produced
mexican
beer
light
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
its
like
slightly
beerflavoured
water
meh
id
rather
drink
modelo
ill
pass
next
time
d
drink
one
drink
two
what
the
hell
its
cheap
its
a
mexican
beer
think
outside
of
the
u
s
think
tacate
andy
d
best
on
a
hot
day
when
you
need
something
ice
cold
to
quench
your
thirst
a
wedge
of
lime
doesnt
hurt
the
taste
finish
dry
finish
with
bitter
aftertaste
some
metallic
notes
and
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
refreshing
mexican
lager
if
you
want
beer
taste
though
i
would
look
elsewhere
this
is
a
very
unpretentious
adjunct
lager
the
working
mans
beer
of
mexico
looks
like
a
typical
mexican
lager
pale
yellow
with
a
crisp
white
head
for
what
it
is
it
is
fine
a
little
more
hoppy
than
most
of
its
competitors
and
doesnt
have
that
awful
corona
taste

this
beer
is
okay
for
a
budget
brew
similiar
to
a
miller
high
life
in
taset
and
price
you
can
get
this
on
the
cheap
at
10
for
a
12
pack
of
cans
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
carbonation
works
well
with
the
beer
this
is
simply
another
alcohol
delivery
system
dhate
to
say
it
but
better
wlime
and
salt
this
one
is
the
low
one
on
the
totem
today
and
weve
had
some
good
times
wthis
one
in
the
past
but
its
not
too
tasty
wout
some
help
bought
these
to
refill
the
bottles
with
home
brew
at
2
50
a
quart
bottle
well
worth
it
taste
is
pretty
watery
with
a
hefty
corn
presence
mixed
with
some
husky
grains
not
as
bad
as
i
remember
tecate
being
it
has
more
flavor
than
the
typical
mexican
lager
but
it
is
not
the
best
of
flavor
profiles
i
considered
giving
this
one
some
credit
for
its
light
regular
lager
brand
appeal
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
play
beer
pong
with
it
even
in
its
hometown
in
mexico
dont
people
there
prefer
bud
light
does
tecate
advertise
and
market
itself
well
like
the
king
of
beers
im
just
trying
to
figure
out
howwhy
a
beverage
like
this
makes
such

another

on

loses
a
few
of
them
for

even
for
a

drinkable
and
refreshing
nothing
to
write

about
but
for
the
genre
pretty
decent
d
its
pretty
light

and
bland
so
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
d
goes
down
easily
but
so
does
water
better
than
the
light
north
american
macros
which
it
resembles
yet
really
refreshing
the
cuauhtémoc
moctezuma
brewing
company
is
well
capable
of
producing
a
good
lager
when
it
sets
its
mind
on
it
but
this
emblematic
brand
seems
to
be
produced
enmass
and
as
cheaply
as
possible
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
yeast
cleanliness
strong
adjunct
aroma
and
very
weak
malt
note
fits
the
style
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
adjunct
up
front
and
then
some
yeast
cleanliness
comes
through
overall
the
not
a
very
strong
flavor
but
also
no
strong
adjunct
aftertaste
which
is
a
plus
d
pretty
drinkable
in
the
warm
weather
here
in
phoenix
d
thats
the
whole
idea
something
light
and
crisp
for
a
summer
day
it
meets
that
goal
headon
as
i
said
its
like
a
corona
turned
into
a
better
drink
it
has
a
better
taste
smell
well
better
everything
its
not
exactly
an
amazing
drink
though
d
better
than
the
american
macro
lagers
but
still
has
a
ways
to
go
before
hitting
the
big
time
of
such
lagers
as
session
or
red
stripe
not
a
bad
beer
simple
and
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
its
certainly
one
of
the
nicer
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
nothing
amazing
here
and
taste
a
lot
like
other
mexican
beers
d
this
one
goes
down
easy
enough
i
picture
a
generic
can
of
beer
labeled
as
such
beer
i
could
drink
this
or
most
of
the
similar
clones
but
why
bother
answer
becuase
it
was
a
free
nonskunky
newtome
beer
drinkability
el
yawno
a
boring
and
altogether
bland
lager
to
pair
up
and
down
with
mexican
chow
i
suppose
ill
have
to
search
the
freezer
for
some
taquitos
average
mexican
brew
thirst
quenching
on
a
long
day
on
the
links
or
the
beach
when
in
the
neighborhood
not
really
worth
seeking
out
above
the
49th
pretty
not
much
huh
im
yearning
to
switch
this
for
a
real
beer
ah
real
beer
i
just
cant
live
without
you
drinkability
is
better
than
average
mostly
due
to
the
4
5
abv
fairly
refreshing
when
served
cold
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
spicey
mexican
food
i
got
this
with
a
variety
pack
from
world
market
i
had
this
beer
with
a
thai
dish
and
it
actually
was
a
very
good
match
with
it
it
had
decent
appearance
pouring
yellow
with
a
ok
head
that
did
stay
around
longer
than
i
thought
it
would
this
was
not
a
great
beer
but
it
was
good
with
the
thai
dish
for
some
reason
this
is
far
far
different
and
better
pours
clear
gold
with
a
decent
white
head
moderate
lacing
sweet
cornmeal
sugar
and
the
metal
is
replaced
by
grass
smooth
sweet
taste
with
actual
grassy
hops
dry
finish
the
pour
gives
it
a
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipates
a
pale
straw
color
with
lots
of
effervesces
there
is
little
smell
i
could
pick
up
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
wheat
and
yeast
it
has
a
yeasty
tastes
with
a
bumpy
finish
overall
it
is
semi
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
d
even
for
an
adjunct
lager
this
is
pretty
poor
i
will
not
be
having
another
glad
i
just
bought
a
single
do
not
attempt
to
pair
this
with
seafood
or
anything
else
for
that
matter
an
ok
summer
brew
when
ice
cold
outside
of
that
i
dont
think
id
ever
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
my
hands
on
it
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
one
could
drink
this
all
night
long
nothing
special
kind
of
just
another
vegetablecorny
adjunct
brew
easy
to
toss
back
one
of
the
smoother
liter
macros
out
there
refreshing
i
suppose
but
nothing
special
d
i
used
to
think
the
tecate
and
corona
were
on
par
with
one
another
i
was
wrong
this
is
the
better
beer
its
nothing
special
however
but
it
does
go
well
with
mexican
food
cheers
overall
for
the
price
which
is
really
cheap
this
is
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
ive
had
next
to
negro
modello
just
a
cheap
straight
forward
beer
highly
recommended
22oz
can
bought
at
smiths
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
small
white
head
a
decent
aroma
of
corn
and
sweet
malts
the
flavor
is
decent
lots
of
sweet
malt
straw
and
corn
a
light
hops
perhaps
in
the
finish
not
bad
at
all
but
not
good
either
just
a
ok
drinkable
lager
tried
this
at
acapulcos
mexican
restaurant
the
beer
poured
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
though
darker
than
a
corona
with
minimal
white
lace
relatvely
clean
aroma
virtually
nothing
in
the
scent
other
than
a
faint
grain
and
corn
girt
smell
intense
crispness
in
a
light
body
clean
palate
with
a
thin
grain
flavour
throughout
some
corn
grit
and
light
hop
bitterness
rounded
out
this
brew
and
its
dry
finish
not
a
bad
beer
preferable
than
a
corona
the
taste
is
grain
with
a
hint
of
bland
fresh
green
apples
faintly
sweet
with
the
faintest
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
its
really
very
bland
and
a
bit
watery
but
clean
crisp
and
pleasant
this
is
one
beer
that
even
i
say
really
is
better
very
cold
when
i
makes
up
for
lack
of
flavour
with
a
very
clean
refreshing
hoppy
crispness
with
food
and
warmed
its
character
tends
to
become
more
grassy
and
bitter
to
the
exclusion
of
other
traits
but
not
terribly
so
d
very
easy
to
drink
d
tecate
is
just
another
massproduced
beer
with
little
or
no
personality
the
taste
is
simply
nondescript
pass
drinkability
not
bad
its
a
decent
macro
lager
and
if
your
south
of
the
border
you
can
do
much
worse
the
beer
poured
a
clear
light
golden
yellow
with
a
very
light
highly
carbonated
head
that
was
not
well
retained
this
was
probably
the
best
part
of
the
beer
the
aroma
was
very
thin
cornish
aroma
but
also
had
a
slight
sweet
hint
to
it
the
taste
was
not
good
very
weak
thin
again
with
the
corn
and
also
a
grain
flavor
i
could
barely
get
the
one
down
the
beer
was
way
overcarbonated
and
felt
very
light
i
could
only
drink
one
and
i
am
glad
that
we
finished
off
that
6pack
yet
it
took
about
3
weeks
overall
not
a
good
beer
avoid
you
could
slam
a
good
bit
of
this
typical
for
a
macro
lager
but
not
very
desireable
im
sorry
i
wasted
2
on
it
this
beer
poured
muted
yellow
with
a
very
small
head
and
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
faint
with
a
bit
of
buscuity
yeast
and
corn
the
taste
is
mostly
sweet
malt
with
tiny
bit
of
hops
in
the
midpallate
and
a
fairly
crisp
finish
a
bit
of
a
watery
mouthfeel
with
some
fine
carbonation
id
say
where
this
beer
shines
is
in
its
drinkability
and
its
pairing
with
spicy
foods
i
tend
to
enjoy
it
the
most
in
large
quanitities
or
with
a
nice
spicy
burrito
avoid
like
the
mexican
plague
overall
not
bad
for
the
style
and
i
scored
it
as
such
i
would
take
a
can
of
this
any
day
over
a
corona
or
bmc
tecate
is
a
great
no
frills
no
thinking
beer
i
could
put
away
a
few
of
these
on
a
sweltering
hot
day
and
not
think
twice
good
for
what
it
is
a
macro
lager
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
golden
with
a
fairly
decent
head
fair
lacing
smells
like
straw
grains
and
fairly
yeasty
tastes
fairly
sweet
intially
and
finishes
a
touch
bitter
light
body
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
ive
had
this
cinco
de
mayo
pours
golden
amber
with
a
white
head
that
goes
snap
crackel
pop
mld
malt
nose
but
better
than
most
us
macros
taste
has
slight
roast
malt
with
just
enough
hops
to
give
it
a
dry
finish
which
was
a
good
match
with
baja
fish
tacos
i
know
from
those
nights
of
drinking
cans
you
really
dont
want
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
but
this
was
fine
to
go
with
tacos
dosed
with
a
hot
habanero
sauce
d
pretty
drinkable
and
i
might
get
it
again
when
im
at
my
favorite
mexican
restaurant
the
mexican
equivalent
of
bmc
the
pour
is
piss
yellow
with
no
lace
and
a
distinctly
acidic
scent
that
is
not
inviting
at
all
flavor
is
all
corn
and
grain
mixed
in
with
too
much
carbonation
i
guess
the
figure
the
more
carbonation
the
more
it
will
mask
the
bad
flavor
well
in
that
case
they
need
to
add
some
more
because
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
non
existent
and
when
you
do
taste
something
it
tastes
like
dry
skunk
not
recommended
good
thirst
quencher
not
a
good
beer
there
are
worse
beers
out
there
but
there
are
more
better
beers
out
there
i
do
not
mind
this
beer
at
all
it
is
definitely
my
goto
session
beer
when
i
am
drinking
cheap
beer
with
my
friends
because
we
all
love
it
compared
to
other
macros
i
think
this
is
my
personal
preference
drinkability
is
very
good
making
it
ideal
for
beachfishing
days
when
the
florida
sun
is
beating
on
you
www
theviceblog
com
first
of
all
you
want
to
drink
this
beer
cold
warm
tecate
is
bad
news
secondly
there
are
worse
macro
lagers
to
drink
on
a
hot
texas
summer
day
id
much
rather
have
a
tecate
in
a
can
over
a
bud
or
bud
light
any
day
a
totally
average
beer
to
be
sure
but
if
you
temper
your
expectations
accordingly
you
wont
be
disappointed
i
pour
it
into
a
pint
glass
to
investigate
pale
yellow
gold
color
and
a
crappy
little
fizzy
head
that
goes
away
rapidly
it
stinks
of
inferior
ingredients
i
would
describe
it
as
smelling
like
old
corn
duck
feed
and
a
sour
dish
rag
theres
a
hint
of
sweetness
from
maltyness
in
the
flavor
but
this
budweiserofmexico
is
thinbodied
mediocre
and
not
very
tasty
in
other
words
its
exactly
what
i
expected
i
go
down
to
mexico
every
december
and
this
is
the
most
popular
beer
in
the
town
trevino
which
is
located
right
outside
of
monterrey
where
its
brewed
so
its
always
fresh
this
beer
is
amazing
it
is
way
better
when
bought
in
mexico
than
it
is
in
america
even
the
ones
in
texas
dont
taste
the
same
never
buy
in
a
bottle
you
will
be
disappointed
canned
is
the
way
to
go
at
five
dollars
a
6pack
you
cant
beat
it
by
far
my
favorite
beer
and
mexicos
finest
i
wanna
brush
my
teeth
with
it
overall
not
a
great
mexican
stab
at
the
style
so
blah
im
hard
pressed
to
even
come
up
with
thoughts
or
opinions
on
this
beer
its
not
so
offensive
that
i
would
turn
one
down
and
im
sure
it
washes
down
food
well
enough
but
its
just
dull
i
was
so
bored
by
halfway
through
the
can
that
i
forgot
it
was
in
front
of
me
if
i
was
preoccupied
im
sure
i
could
down
a
couple
the
price
discourages
future
buys
how
mexican
beers
are
consistently
more
expensive
than
canadian
ones
that
are
almost
always
better
confuses
me
not
the
best
or
worst
mexican
beer
this
is
an
incredibly
bad
beer
the
dms
vegital
flavors
and
aromas
combined
with
the
grainy
husky
characters
are
very
unappealing
recently
at
a
barbecue
these
were
available
in
the
bottle
iced
nice
and
cold
from
an
ice
chest
drank
sans
lime
tasted
like
mexican
beer
as
usual
but
something
a
little
sweeter
and
less
offensive
than
corona
many
comments
from
others
along
the
lines
of
this
tasting
better
than
corona
which
seems
to
be
ubiquitous
at
these
functions
had
four
or
five
left
over
didnt
realize
my
wife
had
bought
these
so
i
got
to
take
them
home
and
enjoy
in
the
following
week
still
have
a
couple
so
theyre
not
that
great
but
nothing
to
shy
away
from
if
theyre
on
special
at
the
supermarket
a
friend
brough
a
sixer
to
the
house
and
left
three
on
his
departure
i
drank
one
there
are
still
two
left
and
will
be
for
some
time
unless
he
comes
back
soon
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
it
were
the
thin
nature
works
toward
a
drinkable
character
but
as
is
so
often
the
case
in
macro
style
beers
the
question
to
ask
is
why
would
i
drink
this
over
other
more
worthy
possibilities
the
answer
for
me
is
i
wouldnt
not
again
anyway
overall
never
would
have
guessed
it
but
this
was
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
d
a
little
boring
to
drink
too
many
of
these
and
if
i
was
drunk
and
reaching
for
a
macro
tecate
probably
wouldnt
come
to
mind
first
decent
and
unoffensive
enough
though
suprising
to
me
was
how
much
better
this
was
then
i
feared
bmc
drinkers
will
love
this
as
its
spot
on
for
a
light
american
style
lager
it
was
head
and
shoulders
above
corona
but
a
step
behind
modelo
as
far
as
mexican
beers
go
though
its
not
bad
drinkablity
similar
to
that
of
flavored
water
which
this
beer
strongly
remembles
ugh
this
is
bad
although
as
most
reviewers
have
observed
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
at
all
so
whatever
it
pours
i
light
pee
color
and
really
smells
awful
like
hard
core
cat
pee
and
im
not
exaggerating
well
maybe
a
little
flavor
is
skunky
malt
and
grain
with
a
ton
of
insipid
crap
tossed
in
corn
body
is
thin
its
exactly
like
youd
expect
a
macro
lager
to
be
only
its
from
mexico
i
will
say
it
seems
like
most
of
the
mexican
beer
ive
tried
is
the
definitely
of
lawnmower
high

the

they
should

called

mild
taste
of

and
grain
served
in
a
24oz
tall
boy
can
the
start
was
quite
alright
but
the
rest
accounts
for
the
overall
low
scores
i
tried
this
beer
on
february
21
2008
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
an
a
translucent
gold
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
and
significant
effervescence
the
smell
was
quite
awful
actually
grainy
vomit
describes
it
best
the
mouthfeel
was
highly
carbonated
and
watery
the
flavour
was
metallic
in
nature
a
bit
of
malt
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
no
hoppy
bitterness
pours
out
the
can
a
dark
straw
yellowwith
a
thin
pillow
white
head
aroma
is
not
of
hops
but
a
sweet
corn
aroma
taste
is
soapy
and
adjunct
sweet
mouthfeel
is
thin
highly
carbonated
and
crisp
i
have
to
say
the
drinkability
is
very
highi
would
drink
this
over
bud
or
an
american
big
boy
lager
decent
lager
for
the
summer
the
color
is
fizzy
yello
with
very
little
smell
to
it
what
smell
there
is
gives
off
a
slight
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
thin
the
moderateheavy
carbonation
makes
this
a
crisp
beer
but
easy
to
drink
a
good
session
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
while
eating
burgers
or
grilling
some
dogs
light
body
with
no
depth
had
this
at
old
cs
and
had
heartburn
the
whole
next
day
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
even
to
my
enemy
a
pale
yellow
urinish
color
with
a
weak
white
head
smells
yeasty
and
a
bit
grainy
pours
with
a
pretty
ok
head
but
it
is
gone
all
too
soon
the
taste
is
fairly
standard
for
any
mexican
lager
or
any
macro
lager
for
that
matter
grainy
and
bitter
corn
mixed
with
cheap
hops
overall
it
is
an
average
macro
lager
but
the
again
most
of
them
fall
under
standard
id
rather
have
a
water
it
went
pretty
well
with
the
food
and
was
better
than
i
expected
certainly
better
than
corona
and
i
think
its
even
cheaper
than
corona
if
you
buy
it
from
the
store
while
there
is
nothing
truly
remarkable
about
this
beer
in
any
way
if
you
are
looking
for
a
very
drinkable
standard
mexican
beer
you
should
probably
give
it
a
shot
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
this
is
a
really
awful
cerveca
final
thoughts
definately
had
an
idea
of
what
i
was
stepping
into
when
i
picked
up
this
watery
golden
potion
however
it
did
come
with
some
body
if
only
the
brewers
could
take
that
note
and
try
and
brew
a
beer
worth
drinking
never
be
afraid
to
take
chances
friends
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
unless
they
had
a
low
price
range
drinkability
notes
i
was
expecting
one
of
the
worst
beers
so
since
i
set
my
sights
so
low
it
wasnt
that
bad
i
probably
would
never
get
again
but
its
not
as
though
anything
north
of
the
border
of
this
style
is
any
better
pours
clear
fizzy
pale
gold
doesnt
smell
like
much
corny
as
sweet
as
high
life
but
it
has
slightly
more
hop
and
yeast
flavor
i
mean
its
subtle
but
its
supposed
to
be
a
pretty
flavorless
style
too
fizzy
a
little
syrupy
but
ultimately
leaves
you
with
that
take
another
sip
feeling
that
i
expect
from
a
decent
lager
definitely
goes
down
easy
a
fine
canned
macro
by
me
this
is
another
beer
that
could
be
best
used
as
a
good
thirst
quencher
with
nothing
there
that
really
offends
you
stock
up
for
cinco
de
mayo
d
a
good
beer
to
play
beer
pong
and
other
drinking
games
with
you
can
definitely
tell
that
this
stuff
was
mass
produced
this
beer
had
no
taste
or
consistency
and
definitely
could
not
see
any
need
to
drink
it
unless
you
are
planning
to
get
sloshed
serving
type
bottle
its
a
good
beer
for
the
style
in
all
honesty
certainly
not
my
favorite
style
but
within
it
i
would
pick
this
one
over
most
others
a
great
lawnmower
beer
for
bas
as
it
actually
tastes
and
smells
like
barley
ill
probably
pick
it
up
again
if
i
need
a
light
beer
in
a
can
for
the
beach
or
whatever
gold
colored
beer
with
quickly
fading
head
aroma
and
taste
are
your
typical
vegetables
served
ice
cold
and
with
a
hot
mexican
dish
this
can
be
one
solid
beer
i
would
buy
again
especially
if
it
was
a
hot
humid
day
or
eating
spicy
foodi
rate
this
slightly
above
average
d
the
only
times
to
drink
this
is
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
while
eating
some
mexican
food
otherwise
its
just
your
typical
macro
ive
had
this
beer
on
2
different
occasions
once
in
baltimore
in
winter
and
the
other
in
venice
beach
ca
in
summer
both
were
great
experiences
but
i
think
its
more
of
a
summer
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
doesnt
interrupt
the
flavor
of
your
food
does
not
go
well
with
american
cook
out
favorites
but
for
carne
asada
on
the
grill
with
friends
it
can
bee
a
crowd
pleaser
taste
is
a
little
hoppy
and
malty
not
offensive
but
doesnt
stand
out
either
mouthfeel
is
forced
carbonation
drinkable
but
the
blind
taste
test
would
be
hard
to
discern
from
any
of
these
macros
a
boring
brew
in
my
opinion
that
doesnt
this
was
that
good
either
watery
still
on
the
backend
as
it
slides
down
but
there
is
some
hop
variance
to
give
it
a
taste
at
least
it
wasnt
rough
still
havent
found
a
latino
beer
that
is
really
really
good
i
dont
mind
i
just
prefer
a
lot
of
other
beers
before
this
ok
with
a
meal
i
guess
but
nothing
id
try
again
this
poured
with
a
light
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
the
color
was
a
bright
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
light
slightly
sweet
faintly
lagerlike
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
slightly
sweet
and
again
lagerlike
in
its
taste
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
light
smooth
and
lagerlike
does
anyone
else
notice
a
trend
it
has
always
been
a
good
accompaniment
to
mexican
food
especially
at
el
zoccolo
restaurant
in
the
outer
mission
district
of
san
francisco
where
i
had
many
meals
with
my
uncle
and
a
buddy
of
his
r
i
p
jack
fleiner
12
oz
can
trying
to
rate
easy
to
find
stuff
wow
worse
smelling
beer
i
have
had
so
far
the
strong
smells
dust
cardboard
bandaid
and
sweat
masking
very
light
bready
malts
nothing
great
to
look
at
either
typical
of
the
style
looks
light
clear
yellow
white
head
no
lacing
flavor
is
not
great
but
much
better
than
the
modelo
i
just
had
cleaner
and
sweet
throughout
much
better
tasting
than
the
smell
goes
down
like
water
hmm
pouring
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
bottle
produced
light
foaming
that
dissipates
very
quickly
to
nothing
there
is
absolutely
no
lacing
with
this
brew
the
color
is
a
pale
gold
hue
that
is
crystal
clear
smell
was
weak
with
nothing
notable
about
it
the
taste
was
different
from
a
lot
of
the
american
macros
in
that
it
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
or
at
least
no
bittering
but
doesnt
really
seem
out
of
balance
the
finish
is
mostly
clean
with
nothing
really
left
behind
slightly
watery
and
goes
down
easy
but
not
entirely
satisfying
not
bad
either
not
a
complex
beer
but
a
decent
beer
to
wash
down
some
grub
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
brew
was
served
in
a
can
with
a
lime
slice
which
i
thought
was
a
little
odd
i
didnt
use
the
lime
just
drank
the
brew
out
of
the
can
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
are
all
unremarkable
not
a
bad
brew
to
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
one
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
nothing
to
scream
about
but
makes
an
ok
lawnmowing
beer
like
many
other
macros
do
d
thirst
quenching
and
fresh
this
is
a
fine
choice
for
a
mexican
beach
lager
to
drink
on
vacation
nothing
special
but
its
better
than
corona
although
thats
not
really
saying
much
this
thing
is
pretty
simplenot
much
there
from
the
start
to
the
finish
it
pours
goldwith
a
thin
snow
white
head
that
dissipates
in
the
blink
of
an
eyesmells
kind
of
like
playdough
there
is
a
faint
biscuit
taste
with

i
enjoy
this

more
than
bud
but
it
is
the
last
beer
i
would
get
at
a
mexican
restaraunt
the
restaraunts
around
here
usually
serve
this
beer
cheap
with
salt
and
lime
but
i
would
rather
enjoy
a
sol
or
modelo
especial
as
opposed
to
this
i
enjoy
it
more
than
some
of
the
generic
domestics
not
a
bad
mixer
for
michelada
though
which
is
why
i
keep
drinking
it
d
i
had
a
six
pack
of
these
with
lime
over
a
nice
authentic
mexican
dinner
made
for
me
at
a

house
then
i
had
another

just

id
toss
it
in
there
pours
that
fizzy
golden
yellow
color
and
has
virtually
no
smell
at
all
basically
has
no
taste
either
a
bit
malty
with
a
few
astringents
but
youll
never
find
any
sort
of

in

like

that
this

has
to
offer
mouthfeel
is
thin

highly
carbonated
rough
on
the
gag
reflex
really
does
induce
it
a
bit
drinkability
i
will
always
pass
on
this
but
i
have
fond
memories
drinking
it
while
visiting
ensenada
now
on
to
the
beer
itself
no
real
smell
no
real
taste
either
just
maybe
a
bit
of
malt
and
an
astringent
aftertaste
needs
lime
real
bad
color
is
a
nondescript
brownish
no
real
head
just
a
light
coating
of
foam
pours
a
sort
of
darkish
golden
color
with
a
minimum
of
head
but
what
is
there
positively
clings
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
i
cant
smell
anything
on
this
beer
the
taste
is
clean
but
a
little
nondescript
sweetness
theres
no
bitterness
or
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
not
much
there
at
all
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavier
than
water
but
water
is
the
closest
thing
to
it
no
creaminess
or
tingling
or
anything
else
just
water
overall
its
drinkable
but
so
is
water
ive
had
vodka
water
that
had
more
flavor
than
this
ok
beer
for
the
buck
d
very
good
one
of
the
better
macro
lagers
that
ive
had
not
a
great
beer
but
drinkable
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
good
job
tecate
normally
this
is
the
best
of
the
lot
of
mex
lagers
and
fresh
its
clean
and
decent
if
unchallenging
but
canned
and
shipped
2500
miles
to
the
lcbo
to
mortify
on
their
shelves
well
losing
the
light
flavor
it
had
fresh
it
becomes
great
to
down
in
a
bong
and
recite
belch
poetry
nothing
special
here
pours
with
a
fairly
well
sized
head
that
dies
right
away
leaves
behind
some
lacing
clear
golden
colour
smell
is
rather
bland
some
grain
and
malt
not
much
else
has
some
corn
like
notes
on
the
palate
nothing
to
over
power
the
tongue
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
i
am
not
impressed
by
this
beer
it
pours
a
nice
golden
color
but
thats
where
the
positives
end
for
me
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
what
this
beer
seems
flat
and
has
very
little
taste
i
think
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
needed
some
beer
flavored
seltzer
water
pours
straw
yellow
with
adequate
head
aforementioned
foamy
stuff
does
a
decent
job
of
sticking
around
smell
is
faint
of
corn
and
mildew
taste
is
well
of
corn
and
mildew
but
ive
gotta
hand
it
to
it
on
the
finish
clean
as
can
be
and
not
offensive
in
any
way
other
than
in
a
beer
geek
kind
of
way
mouthfeel
is
totally
ordinary
but
refreshing
and
crisp
this
is
the
most
ordinary
beer
imaginable
but
my
friend
brought
some
over
and
ive
gotta
say
that
it
goes
down
pretty
well
on
a
hot
day
a
light
golden
colored
brew
with
notable
head
that
settled
to
a
fine
lace
there
is
a
faint
wheat
smell
but
primarily
i
get
that
cardboard
scent
that
sort
of
kills
your
taste
buds
right
off
the
flavor
is
slightly
malty
a
bit
of
cereal
grain
action
very
mild
dry
and
kind
of
sweet
but
its
all
watered
down
too
watery
for
me
seems
more
like
a
light
beer
its
drinkable
and
probably
works
better
when
hidden
behind
some
enchiladas
with
mole
sauce
but
why
would
you
pass
up
on
a
solid
dos
equis
amber
for
this
thanks
doug
i
probably
wouldnt
have
bought
this
and
certainly
wont
now
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
a
little
lighter
on
the
corn
flavor
but
its
there
needs
a
lime
to
cut
the
corny
sweetness
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
very
filling
its
pretty
decent
for
a
macro
but
overall
its
just
a
runofthemill
beer
in
a
lackluster
style
and
tastes
a
lot
like
the
other
beers
from
this
company
drinkability
at
a
buck
per
12
ounces
this
doesnt
even
make
lawnmower
class
those
have
to
be
affordable
for
what
youre
getting
nothing
here
to
make
me
want
another
drinkable
hey
i
had
4
that
night
so
it
couldnt
be
all
bad
not
that
i
had
a
choice
of
anything
else
but
still
not
so
bad
i
know
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
in
the
distant
past
but
wanted
to
try
it
again
for
old
times
sake
pale
pale
piss
yellow
color
as
you
would
expect
for
a
mcro
lager
smells
sweet
and
thin
tastes
a
bit
better
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
the
flavor
is
fine
and
inoffensive
some
very
slight
citrus
tones
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fuzzy
overall
its
very
average
tasting
but
refreshing
too
im
not
gonna
go
rush
out
and
buy
more
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
hot
day
or
spicy
food
appearance
is
typical
for
this
sort
of
beer
aroma
is
malty
and
rather
weak
taste
is
malty
and
thin
nothing
special
though
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
it
did
not
impress
me
then
again
i
drank
it
from
a
can
maybe
a
bottle
or
ontap
serving
would
have
tasted
better
tecate
beer
is
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
i
dont
find
it
objectionable
in
the
least
its
better
than
most
other
mexican
lagers
and
most
american
macro
lagers
and
its
really
cheap
too
had
this
the
other
night
at
a
mexican
restaurant
it
went
pretty
well
with
the
food
and
was
better
than
i
expected
certainly
better
than
corona
and
i
think
its
even
cheaper
than
corona
if
you
buy
it
from
the
store
while
there
is
nothing
truly
remarkable
about
this
beer
in
any
way
if
you
are
looking
for
a
very
drinkable
standard
mexican
beer
you
should
probably
give
it
a
shot
ill
have
to
try
again
in
mex
restaurants
with
meals
drank
pretty
easy
better
than
most
mexican
offerings
recall
the
no
detectable
bitterness
i
described
in
the
taste
many
people
ive
talked
to
who
arent
crazy
about
beer
find
this
as
one
of
the
beer
beers
they
can
tolerate
i
cant
tell
you
that
personally
because
i
never
had
a
tecate
in
my
beer
palate
development
days
might
be
a
good
beer
to
start
out
with
though
not
one
id
have
even
on
occasion
at
least
its
better
and
cheaper
than
sol
this
is
an
alcopop
especially
with
the
lime
an
alcohol
delivery
vehicle
theoretically
made
from
malted
barley
and
hops
but
with
absolutely
no
flavor
it
might
be
better
than
some
north
american
macros
because
it
practically
tastes
like
nothing
while
other
us
beers
actually
taste
worse
than
nothing
notes
my
review
here
is
quite
a
bit
above
average
taking
into
account
the
style
i
think
3
45
is
fitting
tecate
is

to
my
mouth
much
better
than
corona
budweiser
miller
and
the
other
runofthemill
beers
that
are
the
average
aml
brew
dit
is
what
it
is
a
fizzy
relatively
unoffensive
but
unflavorful
macro
lager
i
cant
see
paying
import
prices
for
this
toss
it
in
a
milwaukees
best
can
and
noone
would
know
the
difference
not
a
horrible
beer
but
nothing
i
would
drink
again
probably
better
than
corona
but
not
as
good
as
carta
blanca
drank
this
strait
out
of
the
bottle
side
by
side
with
one
in
a
pint
glass
pale
as
hell
and
very
fizzy
looking
not
as
disgusting
looking
as
corona
though
the
appearance
is
light
light
yellow
almost
like
some
light
beer
made
in
america
the
smell
is
nonexistance
nothing
to
smell
which
i
guess
is
a
good
thing
for
a
mexican
beer
the
taste
is
light
corn
and
wheat
nothing
more
nothing
less
a
carlsberg
overpowered
this
beer
by
a
longshot
to
say
that
much
it
just
screamed
no
ingredients
the
mouthfeel
is
pure
water
almost
michelob
ultraish
but
still
loads
better
than
any
of
that
crap
good
part
you
could
probably
drink
a
12
pack
over
the
course
of
an
afternoon
and
not
feel
any
aftereffects
of
hop
oil
or
bloating
just
like
drinking
alot
of
water
in
a
way
but
better
of
course
overall
serve
cold
and
with
a
lime
when
your
local
mexican
joint
doesnt
carry
negra
modelo
drinkability
very
sessionable
and
decent
drinking
on
a
hot
day
when
its
ice
cold
thats
about
it
tho
there
are
certainly
better
mexican
beers
out
there
pours
a
light
yellow

large
coarse

dissipates
quickly
some

surprisingly
not

light

very
light
taste
of
corn
light
malt
some
faint
hops
mild
skunk
big
carbonation
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
of
the
beer
overall
a
super
light
and
easy
drinking
brew
to
go
along
with
food
or
as
an
icecold
thirst
quencher
this
poured
a
darker
golden
with
really
no
head
at
all
smell
very
weak
not
much
to
take
from
it
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
like
a
flat
corona
theres
not
a
lot
to
really
say
about
this
beer
its
just
decent
something
you
might
find
a
high
school
or
college
house
party
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
it
but
if
youre
just
looking
for
something
to
get
you
by
for
an
evening
for
little
price
i
guess
its
a
decent
possibility
drinkability
i
hate
to
give
a
beer
credit
for
not
being
awful
but
this
is
a
fairly
tolerable
mexican
macro
its
certainly
better
than
the
corona
that
my
cousins
probably
paid
quite
a
bit
more
for
this
is
a
decent
solid
cerveza
it
pours
a
fairy
pale
gold
to
tan
with
very
little
head
retention
barely
any
smell
perhaps
some
hops
but
the
taste
brings
out
the
hops
a
bit
more
well
carbonated
with
an
average
mouth
feel
its
a
good
choice
with
take
out
mexican
food
or
even
a
bowl
of
chips
and
salsa
very
good
at
cooling
the
heat
add
lime
to
punch
it
up
a
bit
tasted
like
a
cross
between
a
budwiser
and
a
corona
decent
but
far
from
great
had
it
as
part
of
a
popular
mexican
cocktail
called
a
la
michelada
but
i
was
sure
to
try
it
on
its
own
first
then
i
mixed
it
with
worcestershire
sauce
and
not
awful
i
would
agree
that
this
is
better
than
corona
its
just
another
boring
macro
lager

this
is
what
they
always
have
on
hand
on
poker
night
over
at
my
buddys
place
so
i
end
up
drinking
more
of
this
than
i
care
to
its
not
terrible
its
just
not
good
while
its
drinkable
its
not
enjoyable
its
just
passable
good
enough
to
go
down
overall
pretty
bad
not
as
bad
as
some
other
mexican
beers
available
but
not
one
i
would
really
ever
want
again
avoid
stopped
in
at
the
gasser
with
a
thirst
but
they
had
little
to
choose
from
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
brew
bottle
smell
is
very
sweet
poured
into
a
glass
has
a
big
bubbled
head
that
dies
immediately
glass
smell
is
also
sweet
color
is
a
deep
yellow
almost
reminds
me
of
lagers
i
grew
up
on
like
swing
with
the
king
and
roar
for
more
lightly
carbonated
flavor
kind
of
bland
sweet
start
but
not
much
finish
to
speak
of
fades
very
rapidly
amazingly
i
remember
this
beer
being
better
out
of
a
can
i
think
because
i
was
in
the
blazing
sun
and
it
was
good
as
an
ice
cold
thirst
quencher
i
probably
will
only
return
to
drink
this
if
choices
are
very
limited
notes
this
is
terrible
definitely
one
of
the
worse
beers
that
i
have
had
theres
nothing
to
this
beer
light
carbonation
overly
sweet
no
flavor
and
a
aroma
laden
with
faults
this
is
the
believably
the
worst
beer
i
have
drank
yet
drinkability
utterly
awful
another
bad
lager
from
mexico
still
i
can
see
myself
downing
several
as
my
taste
buds
sleep
this
is
a
very
bland
beer
still
a
little
more
flavorful
than
sol
or
corona
it
was
refreshing
in
the
hot
mexican
climate
but
then
so
was
the
bottled
water
pours
an
extra
clear
straw
color
with
a
soapy
one
and
a
half
finger
head
rapid
carbonation
and
poor
head
retention
leave
weak
lacing
very
faint
nose
extra
pale
malt
aroma
but
mainly
adjunct
grainy
malt
flavor
with
herbal
and
haylike
hop
taste
aftertaste
is
clean
the
drinkability
high
and
the
mouthfeel
crisp
appropriate
for
a
very
humid
day
south
of
the
border
but
too
light
and
bland
for
any
other
occasion
pours
dark
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
is
faint
mainly
of
sugar
with
a
bit
hop
the
taste
as
mostly
adjunct
and
malt
but
there
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
it
overall
the
feels
is
pretty
smooth
i
cant
say
this
is
an
awfull
beer
it
does
go
good
with
some
spicy
fajitas
but
its
not
great
i
cant
see
drinking
this
on
its
own
i
had
this
one
in
a
mexican
restaurant
in
texas
its
a
light
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
unimpressive
head
moderate
carbonation
adjunct
laden
aroma
with
a
little
malt
and
hops
hiding
underneath
actually
the
aroma
is
actually
notably
better
than
many
macros
the
taste
is
initially
sweet
in
a
cornadjunct
hollow
way
theres
a
notable
hop
finish
but
the
body
is
incredibly
light
and
watery
i
didnt
come
into
this
one
with
high
expectations
so
i
cant
say
that
i
was
really
disappointed
still
this
is
unquestionably
a

with

white
head
not
picking
much
up
in
the
nose
at
all
maybe
a
little
bit
of
grains
tastes
like
any
other
macro
to
me
very
bland
but
not
offensive
and
rather
refreshing
if
you
get
it
very
cold
mouthfeel
is
decent
very
clean
finishes
dry
and
i
could
easily
have
quite
a
few
of
these
overall
slightly
better
than
the
other
macros
would
be
my
choice
at
a
mexican
restaurent
if
modelo
especial
is
not
available
old
picture
you
have
but
anyway
a
lot
of
people
say
it
is
nasty
but
once
again
the
more
close
you
are
from
the
brewery
the
better
it
taste
in
this
case
t
is
brewed
in
tecate
baja
california
and
for
a
sunny
day
it
worths
a
little
bitter
the
back
taste
for
a
lager
but
tastes
good
after
all
in
some
presentations
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
decent
summer
beer
the
smell
is
a
cross
between
sweet
champagne
and
the
nasty
smell
of
day
old
stale
beer
on
the
floor
initial
strong
carbonation
gives
way
to
a
sweet
sugary
or
maybe
more
like
one
of
the
better
artificial
sweeteners
flavour
on
the
tongue
which
gradually
dissipates
leaving
a
stale
flavour
and
ultimately
dry
feel
this
stuff
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
if
i
had
already
drunk
a
couple
of
better
beers
to
deaden
my
critical
faculties
to
a
degree
tecate
is
an
excruciatingly
unchallenging
beer
that
nevertheless
is
a
decent
south
of
the
border
thirst
quencher
that
fulfills
its
mission
statement
perfectly
its
a
light
semiflavorful
unfailingly
polite
dont
wanna
think
too
much
about
it
goes
with
mexican
food
rehydrating
grows
on
you
after
a
while
put
away
a
sixpack
with
ease
no
limes
in
the
vicinity
inexpensive

be

kind
of

obtained
from
the

rack
of

a
finger
and
a
half
nearly
white
linght
tint
of
yellow
head
over
a
crystal
clear
very
light
rust
liquid
add
a
very
pale
rust
to
the
very
pale
straw
of
color
of
a
macro
and
you
get
this
bubbles
form
randomly
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
float
to
the
surface
smells
potently
hopped
with
something
like
saaz
that
would
impart
a
tin
smell
to
many
people
this
comes
across
as
smelling
skunked
tastes
mildly
hoppy
with
noticable
malt
sweet
hops
have
some
hallertauer
roundness
and
a
touch
of
coho
roughness
malt
is
pretty
clean
but
has
some
honey
upopn
swallowing
there
is
an
acrid
taste
from
carbonation
release
this
sting
on
the
tongue
settles
fairly
rapidly
and
leaving
some
floral
hop
and
some
flat
malt
sweet
as
an
aftertaste
body
is
thin
but
with
some
quality
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
makes
it
come
across
to
casual
taste
as
mdlight
carbonation
is
high
amazingly
there
is
still
a
tiny
layer
of
head
still
on
top
of
the
last
little
bit
in
my
glass
and
the
inside
of
my
glass
shows
incredible
lacing
judged
to
style
its
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
yet
another
pale
lager
which
isnt
much
in
the
first
place
pours
a
decent
thick
head
color
is
almost
a
decent
golden
pilsener
taste
is
bland
at
first
but
begins
to
reveal
a
little
malt
character
and
a
suggestion
of
german
hops
at
least
it
goes
well
with
mexican
food
and
yes
with
a
touch
of
lime
but
you
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
by
itself
poured
a
pale
gold
color
with
an
overactive
white
bollowly
head
that
lasted
throughtout
the
brew
smell
is
nothing
taste
is
sweetish
and
not
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
wet
but
little
if
any
hops
or
malt
average
at
best
id
rather
drink
a
schlitz
at
half
the
price
not
a
bad
brew
sure
kicks
the
crap
outta
corona
though
clear
yellowgold
pour
with
a
nearbleached
thick
white
head
that
stuck
for
a
while
and
thats
when
things
started
going
into
a
downward
spiral
it
reminded
me
of
goopy
burned
corn
oil
on
the
nose
something
unpleasant
and
somewhat
rancid
about
it
a
good
hop
on
the
tongue
if
you
can
avoid
the
smell
but
it
isnt
really
countered
by
anything
and
leaves
an
oily
film
and
aftertaste
on
your
tongue
not
readily
drinkable
but
mostly
because
of
the
smell
the
taste
and
feel
i
could
have
swallowed
if
the
smell
hadnt
gotten
to
me
drinkability
is
soso
at
best
while
better
than
most
megabrew
offerings
its
nothing
special
unless
you
just
want
something
cold
and
wet
that
wont
make
you
gag
and
has
some
alcohol
in
it
while
certainly
a
great
beer
at
least
it
doesnt
require
a
lime
wedge
to
make
it
drinkable
pale
yellow
color
with
a
decent
head
head
retention
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
smells
like
light
grains
with
a
metallic
aroma
taste
pretty
bland
grains
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
clean
finish
light
but
not
over
carbonated
mouthfeel
not
bad
basically
a
budweiser
from
mexico
reviewed
from
4204
taken
from
notes
straw
colored
nice
carbonation
and
small
to
medium
bright
white
head
nose
is
mostly
neutral
with
hint
of
malt
sweet
malty
flavor
medium
to
full
body
short
sweet
flavor
enjoyable
finish
is
very
short
crisp
and
dry
pours
with
a
frothy
pale
head
that
quickly
dissapears
it
is
a
bright
pale
strow
color
and
is
pretty
well
carbonated
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
notes
of
grain
corn
and
an
actual
light
hoppy
spiciness
though
with
an
emphasis
on
light
this
beer
is
light
and
fizzy
with
a
sweet
finish
that
has
hints
of
dms
sweet
corn
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
bitterness
this
beer
as
expected
is
pretty
flavorless
but
that
is
really
the
only
complaint
i
can
make
if
you
drink
it
cold
there
is
nothing
to
distract
you
from
thinking
that
it
is
just
watery
refreshment
just
a
note
if
someone
had
not
handed
me
this
beer
i
would
not
be
drinking
it
company
beer
oclock
what
can
you
do
pours
like
any
macro
lager
would
pale
wheat
yellow
color
with
minimal
white
lacey
head
smells
decent
i
noted
a
little
apricot
like
fruitiness
along
with
the
thin
and
sour
hop
smell
one
would
associate
with
a
macro
lager
taste
is
one
dimensional
nothing
impressive
tastes
like
a
macro
brew
but
not
overly
sweet
and
with
a
faint
orange
citrus
note
toward
the
end
alcohol
is
hardly
detectable
watery
unexciting
mouth
presence
this
beer
lacks
the
crisp
corniness
i
associate
with
mexican
imports
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
would
only
do
so
if
well
never
mind
drinkability
with
so
many
other
lighter
domestic
style
beers
out
there
why
would
you
pay
more
to
drink
this
beer
when
there
are
better
versions
of
the
watered
down
macro
that
dont
cost
as
much
but
its
not
really
all
that
bad
either
an
automatic
buy
when
you
go
to
a
gathering
where
you
dont
know
who
is
attending
nothing
horrible
or
outstanding
very
nondescriptaverage
thirst
quencher
on
tap
at
taco
surf
and
many
other
places
over
the
years
pours
slightly
bubbly
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
clean
just
a
hint
of
adjunct
and
not
much
else
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
by
no
means
a
great
beer
but
i
would
take
it
over
corona
any
day
and
its
a
nice
happy
hour
choice
possibly
one
of
the
greatest
sins
against
beer
ever
perpetrated
run
dont
walk
away
from
this
beer
trust
me
on
this
one
definitely
rates
highest
on
the
urine
scale
amongst
mexican
beers
whereas
most
of
the
time
you
can
find
something
positive
to
say
about
a
mexican
beer
consumed
while
on
a
beach
or
something
this
stuff
is
way
too
bad
corn
husks
and
skunked
grain
dominate
this
beer
pretty
fizzy
leaves
that
draino
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
after
being
consumed
from
the
can
even
if
youre
looking
for
mexican
crapbeer
to
have
on
the
beach
there
are
so
many
better
options
i
had
my
inlaws
over
last
september
and
after
they
left
i
found
this
can
in
my
refirgerator
it
sat
there
until
now
when
i
fianlly
decided
to
get
rid
of
it
instead
of
just
pouring
it
down
the
drain
i
thought
to
review
it
so
here
it
is
this
beer
pours
like
urine
it
looks
like
piss
in
a
toilet
the
head
looks
like
white
soap
bubbles
in
the
sink
the
head
disappers
very
fast
leaving
absolutely
no
laces
it
smells
very
bad
maybe
like
rotting
corn
i
cant
really
place
it
it
tasted
skunky
other
than
that
it
didnt
really
have
any
distiguishable
flavors
it
was
too
carbonated
i
think
it
was
a
harsh
beer
that
didnt
sit
well
on
the
palate
drinking
more
than
one
of
there
beers
would
probably
make
you
sick
i
just
poured
mine
out
probably
the
smartest
thin
i
did
since
i
opened
the
can
do
not
drink
this
beer
i
can
see
how
this
is
popular
in
that
it
washes
down
spicy
tacos
and
other
food
well
and
does
not
interfere
in
any
of
their
flavors
at
all
i
give
this
beer
a
good
rating
because
it
is
well
above
average
as
an
american
style
lager
if
others
give
this
a
below
average
rating
i
wonder
what
would
make
a
beer
in
this
style
a
perfect
5
0
pale
golden
color
thin
white
foamy

lots
and
lots
of
tiny
bubbles

pale

not
much

pale

slightly

some

flavor
slight

very
high
carbonation
light

decent
amount
of

to
go
with
the
hops
not
the
worst
of
the
mexican
lagers
i
could
see
myself
pounding
these
if
i
was
forced
to
if
nothing
else
tecate
is
completely
inoffensive
but
really
why
bother
this
is
beach
beer
light
no
real
strong
tastes
no
real
off
tastes
or
smells
clean
and
available
in
cans
to
comply
with
the
national
park
service
regulations
with
respect
to
sandy
hook
an
adjuct
lager
that
will
take
the
heat
out
of
the
day
and
not
get
you
intoxicated
too
quickly
i
like
tecate
because
the
price
is
good
and
the
taste
with
or
without
the
lime
is
mild
and
quenching
bavik
and
wittekerke
are
two
other
can
beers
that
seem
to
work
these
days
with
an
aggressive
pour
it
produced
large
soapy
bubbles
over
its
clear
yellowish
color
there
was
definitely
a
malty
nose
which
i
didnt
expect
and
i
could
smell
it
inside
of
a
mexican
restaurant
the
taste
was
very
average
and
inoffensive
there
was
the
cooked
veggie
taste
maybe
it
was
corn
i
dont
know
the
mouthfeel
also
surprised
me
it
was
not
as
thin
as
i
anticipated
it
filled
the
mouth
a
little
overall
an
acceptable
hot
weather
lawn
mower
beer
nothing
to
seek
out
the
beer
poures
a
true
corn
oil
gold
and
has
a
minimal
trace
of
head
the
aroma
is
of
corn
malt
the
taste
is
truly
a
corn
based
beer
and
features
a
sweet
corn
start
with
a
twinge
of
hop
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
oily
tecate
is
passable
as
a
macro
type
session
beer
but
when
you
sit
down
with
a
plate
of
enchiladas
and
tamales
this
is
the
beer
to
have
it
perfectly
cuts
the
chile
oils
and
cleanses
the
palate
for
another
taste
drinkability
o
k
but
for
some
reason
these
are
just
better
when
consumed
on
a
warm
day
or
evening
in
mexico
in
that
setting
i
would
rank
it
higher
but
at
the
time
i
am
in
nebraska
and
it
is
about
36
degrees
would
i
buy
iy
again
not
for
the
regular
price
of
7
49
but
maybe
for

comments
this
beer
is
basically
macro
swill
the
taste
gets
progressively
worse
as
you
drink
the
beer
if
no
other
beer
was
available
i
probably
would
still
pass
on
this
stuff
i
recommend
that
you
also
avoid
it
this
one
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
stanky
grainy
and
a
little
hops
taste
is
stanky
too
very
little
flavor
some
bitterness
dry
finish
with
some
acid
notes
pretty
crappy
beer
here
drinkable
hell
yes
i
could
pound
down
six
of
these
like
they
were
ginger
ale
and
probably
feel
as
much
of
a
buzz
consumed
in
october
2004
in
cancun
mexico
from
the
bottle
geez
all
these
beers
are
the
same
too
bad
they
arent
good
beers
pours
a
light
copper
yellow
color
smells
of
grain
and
maybe
a
few
hops
taste
of
a
few
hops
and
a
few
spices
very
acidic
finish
very
dry
also
had
some
decent
heartburn
after
this
beer
maybe
the
6
tacos
i
had
with
it
didnt
help
ill
stay
away
from
this
one
in
the
future
as
others
have
noted
this
beer
is
better
than
corona
if
corona
is
the
mexican
bud
tecate
is
the
mexican
miller
when
served
icecold
tecate
is
a
pleasant
enough
accompaniment
to
a
burger
or
a
fish
taco
and
its
light
enough
that
you
can
knock
down
quite
a
few
without
feeling
bloated
logy
or
bombed
golden
color
very
fizzy
carbonation
almost
no
foam
or
lacing
slightly
metallic
nose
some
corn
and
vegetables
thin
in
the
malt
department
watery
slightly
sweet
negligible
hops
that
disappear
almost
immediately
the
mouth
feel
is
skunky
like
a
lot
of
mexican
beers
dry
ascerbic
finish
and
one
is
left
with
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
that
lingers
try
sol
or
carta
blanca
avoid
tecate
as
mexican
brews
go
this
one
isnt
half
bad
its
not
good
but
certainly
beats
stuff
like
corona
it
pours
a
crisp
and
bubbly
medium
gold
colour
with
pretty
much
no
head
and
certainly
not
a
sticky
one
it
smells
somewhat
of
corn
grain
and
some
sweetness
very
basic
and
bland
exactly
what
youd
expect
from
this
type
of
brew
the
flavour
is
neat
and
balanced
amongst
the
same
characteristics
as
noted
in
the
smell
while
i
love
my
big
beers
nine
times
out
of
ten
i
dont
want
em
when
eatin
mexican
food
that
said
this
onell
do
just
fine
i
still
prefer
negra
modelo
and
even
dos
equis
to
this
but
its
more
than
serviceable
for
what
its
needed
for
the
beer
pours
a
clarion
gold
with
a
modest
white
head
that
is
frothy
in
texture
and
the
lace
a
concealing
sheet
nose
is
malt
sweet
crisp
and
clean
start
somewhat
sweet
thin
of
the
malt
and
the
top
light
finish
is
dastardly
acidic
the
hops
benign
in
their
spiciness
dry
as
the
sonoran
desert
tecate
is
ok
on
a
hot
day
like
today
looks
like
your
everyday
macro
thicker
head
than
expected
wait
a
minute
its
gone
smell
is
weak
grain
and
wet
paper
taste
is
minimal
a
weak
garainy
corn
like
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
and
unimpressive
drinkabilty
is
pretty
good
a
beer
that
could
go
down
rather
easily
and
quickly
when
hot
and
humid
better
than
a
lot
of
mexican
swill
out
there
this
definitely
is
not
a
bad
imported
mexican
beer
at
all
there
are
some
days
that
i
will
actually
prefer
this
over
corona
it
is
almost
up
to
par
in
the
dos
equiis
region
not
too
bad
it
had
a
very
light
head
and
went
down
smoothly
all
in
all
better
then
most
mexican
beers
around
this
is
the
miller
lite
of
mexican
beers
there
was
very
minimal
taste
and
smell
the
grain
was
detectable
also
slightly
detectable
was
hops
the
liquid
was
clear
and
crisp
but
overall
i
found
this
beer
very
unappealing
one
of
the
worst
mexican
beers
bought
this
on
sale
for
7
99
for
a
12
pack
of
bottles
appearance
is
a
medium
pale
color
head
is
minimal
and
disappears
quickly
smell
is
really
faint
its
clean
but
barely
there
the
taste
is
really
bland
not
exactly
watered
down
just
mild
to
the
point
of
extreme
blandness
the
taste
isnt
offensive
mainly
because
there
isnt
much
to
taste
as
for
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
for
drinking
in
a
cold
mug
on
a
hot
day
good
as
a
thrist
quencher
but
not
for
flavor
this
is
a
decent
knockback
beer
for
a
hot
day
and
one
id
take
over
corona
or
budweiser
anyday
the
price
is
competitive
too
drink
it
from
the
bottle
with
lime
for
best
results
oh
man
pours
as
clear
a
golden
as
you
can
possibly
imagine
nose
totally
of
adjunct
grain
mainly
corn
taste
again
of
corn
adjunct
astringency
bad
grain
no
hops
whatsoever
very
thin
in
the
mouth
not
much
use
not
totally
offensive
just
not
really
much
taste
i
guess
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
session
but
i
dont
know
why
youd
want
to
no
real
reason
to
buy
this
one
unless
youre
faced
with
the
choice
of
this
or
the
traditional
american
macros
not
a
great
beer
but
id
drink
it
over
some
burritos
first
of
all
as
far
as
beers
go
mexico
is
not
the
top
exporter
of
good
beers
but
i
will
admit
that
they
produe
some
damn
good
lawn
mowing
beer
there
really
is
nothing
to
this
but
i
cant
honestly
find
much
out
of
any
pale
lager
watered
down
but
sure
tastes
good
in
the
heat
this
is
one
that
you
can
literally
drink
all
day
not
saying
your
bowels
would
want
you
to
the
head
on
this
one
is
very
poor
big
white
bubbles
that
fade
into
nothingness
it
is
a
very
clear
beer
taste
is
crisp
refreshing
and
simple
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
drinking
bout
or
just
laying
on
a
summers
day
very
drinkable
not
that
great
not
that
bad
ten
times
better
than
corona
the
mouthfeel
and
drink
ability
are
fine
the
beer
goes
great
with
mexican
foods
and
is
worlds
better
than
the
sols
or
coronas
while
not
a
top
tier
mexican
beer
this
is
plenty
to
like
about
it
enjoy
anyhow
everyone
who
gave
this
stuff
a
sorry
rating
i
suppose
this
was
just
not
for
them
because
personally
i
drink
a
ton
of
this
stuff
by
itself
and
with
spanish
food
and
i
think
its
great
not
impressed
with
this
beer
although
ive
heard
diffrently
it
seemed
almost
like
pop
to
me
dont
know
why
couldnt
detect
to
much
falvor
i
was
suprised
at
the
highcarbonated
mouthfeel
which
i
think
led
me
to
feel
like
i
was
drinking
soda
pop
i
wouldnt
necesarrily
throw
this
beer
out
a
window
but
if
presented
with
choices
like
dos
x
i
think
i
would
chose
the
later
tecate
isnt
bad
and
it
is
alot
better
than
other
mexican
beers
at
a
fraction
of
the
price
it
pours
a
gold
yellow
with
minimul
head
the
taste
is
average
blast
of
hops
with
a
little
citrus
thrown
in
at
the
end
feels
carbonated
and
light
in
the
mouth
a
drinkable
beer
in
hot
weather
but
during
the
winter
it
wasnt
my
touch
drinkable
not
a
fine
sipping
beer
but
a
chugging
to
fight
the
heat
beer
way
better
than
corona
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
it
has
a
very
pleasant
smell
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
it
has
a
sweet
malt
palate
but
there
is
no
complexity
this
better
than
most
lagers
it
does
taste
a
bit
watery
but
not
that
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
this
is
a
very
low
bodied
beer
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
very
well
an
excellent
beer
from
south
of
the
border
starting
off
we
have
a
clear
gold
beer
with
a
nice
head
the
aroma
is
mild
and
grainy
the
taste
is
mellow
grainy
and
slightly
sweet
with
not
much
hop
presence
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
carbonation
and
it
is
sort
of
watery
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
there
were
no
new
revelations
here
the
best
part
was
it
came
in
a
brown
bottle
note
to
self
never
ever
ask
a
barkeep
no
matter
how
cute
she
is
to
pick
you
a
beer
my
only
condition
was
no
light
beer
this
thing
is
what
she
picked
me
poured
a
light
yellow
with
some
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
looked
safe
but
thats
about
as
far
as
it
went
smelled
funky
like
corn
husks
and
rotten
water
tasted
about
the
same
sour
corn
funk
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
better
than
that
adding
a
lime
didnt
help
much
but
i
guess
itll
stop
scurvy
what
possessed
me
to
drink
this
had
a
bite
to
it
due
to
the
carbonation
with
decent
flavor
it
could
have
been
crisp
i
dont
think
ill
ever
drink
this
again
even
for
free
ok
maybe
for
free
but
it
tastes
really
good
for
my
money
its
one
of
the
better
pale
lagers
out
there
and
its
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
mexican
beers
on
the
market
very
smooth
and
full
of
character
it
goes
down
real
easy
somewhat
malty
you
get
a
real
feel
for
the
hops
about
halfway
through
the
can
above
average
mouthfeel
i
give
it
a
very
high
score
for
drinkabilty
because
you
can
throw
down
several
of
these
without
even
knowing
it
its
great
for
road
trips
or
backyard
gettogethers
not
easily
found
in
bottles
i
usually
buy
it
in
cans
get
you
some
and
have
a
perfect
beer
moment
of
your
own
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
it
was
actually
fairly
drinkable
and
didnt
become
undrinkable
after
it
warmed
a
little
theres
actually
a
surprising
bit
of
malt
flavor
and
while
that
doesnt
mean
it
was
malty
it
just
means
that
it
was
maltier
than
more
beers
in
the
style
i
even
started
to
pick
up
a
little
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
i
had
this
from
the
bottle
light
gold
color
medium
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
cornish
and
sweet
a
light
bodied
lager
style
beer
light
malt
and
hops
very
little
flavor
or
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
aftertaste
is
nearly
neutral
not
much
to
this
beer
well
made
but
just
not
much
taste
this
beer
poured
a
clear
bright
pale
yellow
gold
color
that
was
incredibly
carbonated
as
we
watched
the
bubble
dance
in
the
light
the
small
white
colored
foam
was
produced
in
the
first
pour
then
fell
to
nothing
except
a
small
ring
on
the
edges
lace
was
present
but
faint
and
barely
visible
the
aroma
was
fresh
clean
and
crisp
but
no
real
smell
except
some
sweet
corn
grain
and
malts
plus
i
did
get
a
whiff
of
lime
but
i
think
it
was
from
the
one
sitting
next
to
the
glass
in
the
napkin
the
tastes
that
i
experienced
were
sweet
malts
faint
citrus
not
from
lime
sweet
grains
ands
a
real
slight
hop
bite
no
after
taste
present
light
medium
bodied
this
is
a
crisp
and
clean
beer
from
down
under
mexico
nothing
really
spectacular
just
what
it
is
refreshing
and
a
good
accompaniment
to
the
carnitas
that
i
was
eating
i
would
get
again
over
some
beers
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
i
mean
it
this
is
doppelganger
bitterness
at
first
peppery
and
refreshing
then
pale
and
stewed
like
an
old
boot
very
drinkable
for
such
awful
material
comments

im
all
over
the
board
on
this
one
ill
rewrite
the
review
if
any
of
the
other
cans
show
improvement
bottle
this
was
not
what
i
would
describe
as
a
good
beer
there
was
not
much
to
it
at
all
the
head
dissolved
very
quickly
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
it
was
bitter
and
watery
tasting
and
it
also
had
an
aftertaste
to
go
along
with
it
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
pale
yellow
i
would
not
commend
this
beer
at
all
except
for
being
a
thirstquench
style
lager
pours
a
pale
and
clean
bright
golden
tone
with
close
to
no
head
at
all
the
smell
very
very
slight
is
of
some
malt
and
hops
but
no
other
than
that
which
suggests
some
maltyness
the
taste
sweet
but
bitter
showing
the
obvious
main
ingredients
is
also
faint
which
makes
it
watery
lacking
flavour
its
like
an
upgraded
corona
which
makes
it
so
far
one
of
the
better
mexicans
a
few
years
ago
i
ordered
this
in
a
mexican
restaurant
and
was
presented
a
bottle
with
a
lime
adding
the
lime
further
increases
the
drinkability
factor
to
this
lacks
the
harshness
and
nastiness
of
corona
this
stuff
goes
down
like
water
a
great
summertime
brew
although
this
is
far
from
being
a
quality
beverage
i
have
found
somewhat
of
a
pbrlike
sanctity
in
this
brew
a
simple
yet
effective
thirst
quencher
i
would
say
this
beer
is
pretty
similar
to
miller
high
life
but
not
quite
as
good
drinkability
a
good
swiller
i
prefer
it
over
corona
if
im
in
the
mood
for
mexican
macroswill
negra
modelo
wears
the
crown
when
it
comes
to
beer
from
south
of
the
border
though
this
guy
has
a
fair
fluffy
white
head
real
clear
paler
gold
color
its
about
what
you
would
be
expecting
from
a
mexican
lager
not
that
great
tasting
but
on
a
nice
hot
day
you
could
put
down
a
ton
of
them
better
than
corona
anywho
not
recommended
not
the
worst
either
color
is
golden
pale
yellow
with
no
head
from
pouring
a
few
clearish
bubbles
sit
around
the
edge
smells
very
faintly
of
spiced
sweet
malt
no
hop
presence
what
so
ever
taste
is
more
of
the
same
very
slightly
spiced
sweet
malt
and
no
hop
to
be
found
its
very
clean
crisp
and
lightly
refreshing
feel
is
a
bit
more
medium
body
but
lacks
in
roundness
mostly
watery
malts
easy
drinker
but
stick
with
dos
equis
pours
a
clear
golden
in
color
with
a
lingering
white
head
aroma
is
feint
with
some
hints
of
grain
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
crisp
light
malt
sweetness
on
the
tongue
with
a
very
mild
hop
yet
rather
clean
finish
goes
down
easy
on
a
warm
day
or
to
wash
down
some
spicy
mexican
food
nothing
fancy
just
a
clean
tasting
mexican
beer
that
provides
a
decent
alternative
to
corona
grabbed
a
bunch
of
big
bottles
at
the
store
and
this
was
among
them
pours
pretty
plain
very
little
head
no
lacing
taste
is
grainy
hard
to
find
any
hops
the
taste
is
only
lightly
malty
it
is
crisp
tasting
and
refreshing
this
is
much
better
than
other
mexican
beers
prefer
this
to
crapona
anyday
lime
and
eat
some
good
food
and
this
beer
will
do
its
job
we
went
to
our
local
mexican
restaurant
tonight
and
my
wife
ordered
a
bicardi
and
diet
coke
and
got
a
tecate
and
a
large
diet
coke
so
i
drank
her
beer
after
a
good
laugh
the
beer
poured
a
fairly
dark
golden
the
head
was
not
strong
but
it
did
linger
on
the
edges
of
the
liquid
throughout
the
glass
it
had
no
aroma
either
good
or
bad
the
taste
fit
the
dinner
but
was
very
mild
with
no
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
light
it
was
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
mexican
food
i
would
rather
have
a
bud
than
a
tecate
for
just
drinking
eh
just
your
average
mexican
beer
what
else
can
i
say
well
ill
have
to
say
why
the
color
is
a
pale
golden
the
taste
is
a
very
light
taste
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
the
consistencey
is
watery
well
it
might
as
well
be
water
overall
nothing
to
get
fired
up
about
go
with
bohemia
negra
modelo
or
even
sol
this
is
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
that
i
have
tried
but
it
is
not
a
good
beer
it
is
very
similar
to
a
corona
but
doesnt
need
a
lime
to
cover
the
smell
and
tastes
a
little
better
the
only
positive
that
i
have
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
drinkable
i
will
not
be
purchasing
this
beer
again
two
thumbs
down
skip
it
id
take
the
red
stripe
over
tecate
any
day
this
is
pretty
much
on
the
same
level
as
corona
carta
blanca
pacifico
etc
lower
than
average
lager
that
seems
to
be
the
norm
for
most
mexican
beers
think
i
will
get
a
margarita
next
time
pours
a
clear
goldenorange
with
a
small
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
that
of
adjuncty
sweet
corn
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
immediate
crispness
along
with
corn
husk
and
grain
with
a
slight
bit
of
sweetness
it
is
light
bodied
and
finishes
with
a
crisp
clean
taste
yet
there
is
almost
no
trace
of
flavor
on
the
end
not
bad
for
the
style
but
nothing
to
hunt
for
salud
clear
golden
color
with
moderate

after
hard

high
carbonation
and
very
faint

with
malt
in
the
background
if
you
really
tried
to
smell
it
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
and
this
is
one
that
you
have
to
add
lemon
to
i
still
like
the
dos

i
like

have

for

i
could

maybe
with

a
better
pick
a
than

clear

is
an

although
the
hop
bitterness
is
atypically
high
for

the

leave
this

most

now
drinkabilitynotes
nothing
terrible
about
this
beer
but
not
that
exceptional
either
there
are
a
number
of
beers
from
mexico
that
for
the
same
money
are
much
better
as
an
aside
i
do
not
do
that
slice
of
lime
thing
that
seems
to
be
so
popular
with
mexican
beers
i
suppose
average
is
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
of
course
its
available
at
nearly
every
mexican
restaurant
and
people
really
think
they
are
being
authentic
to
the
cuisine
drinking
this
decent
cold
with
enchiladas
but
thats
about
it
its
better
than
corona
but
thats
not
necessarily
saying
much
this
is
another
popular
beer
to
drink
with
lime
and
for
good
reason
the
lime
helps
mask
the
taste
a
bit
about
the
only
thing
it
has
going
for
it
is
cheer
factor
and
its
better
than
corona
oh
yeah
its
not
bad
either
i
dont
mind
drinking
these
at
mex
restaurants
but
outside
of
that
theres
no
reason
to
drink
it
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
particularly
good
one
either
comparable
to
most
u
s
macrobrew
lagers
notes
not
one
of
the
best
lagers
to
come
out
of
mexico
its
palatable
but
bland
a
run
of
the
mill
beer
its
flavor
almost
could
take
it
one
step
further
leaving
just
enough
for
you
to
want
to
keep
drinking
a
solid
go
to
that
has
just
a
bit
more
than
the
average
bear
tasty
enough
for
a
repeat
or
two
another
beer
i
remembered
fondly
from
my
youth
that
i
decided
to
try
again
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
it
a
refreshing
lager
that
would
be
great
anytime
i
think
all
of
leinenkugels
fruit
beers
are
the
same
fruity
and
delicious
but
leave
you
wishing
they
had
something
more
distinguishing
than
which
fruit
is
in
this
particular
beer
youre
drinking
at
that
moment
overall
3

yeah
id
drink
it
again
its
not
the
horse
pee
i
remember
it
being
but
it
isnt
really
fantastic
either
id
say
if
you
mixed
pabst
and
miller
high
life
this
is
what
youd
get
dirty
hop
leaf
creamed
corn
gritty
finish
great
daily
drinker
a
bland
lager
with
an
odd
though
mild
soapy
undertone
personally
if
i
had
to
choose
i
would
take
miller
high
life
over
this
there
are
cheaper
bland
brews
out
there
too
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
after
smelling
it
smell
was
definitely
of
a
light
struck
beer
but
the
flavor
of
the
beer
was
actually
more
full
and
malty
the
feel
is
what
can
be
expected
its
lightbodied
with
a
firm
crispness
carboantion
is
moderate
not
too
heavy
which
is
nice
its
got
a
touch
of
smoothness
in
the
body
too
leinies
is
a
very
good
northwoods
brew
the
brewery
isnt
that
far
from
where
i
live
either
chris
lemke
of
wisconsinbrewreview
com
however
id
choose
a
leinies
original
over
its
competitors
any
day
it
does
its
job
well
note
i
review
for
the
style
i
refuse
to
let
my
prejudices
slant
any
review
nothing
worse
than
the
typical
beer
snob
reviewing
an
aal
same
for
your
aal
drinker
reviewing
a
craft
brew
rjt
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
generic
type
lager
id
like
it
better
if
there
was
less
carbonation
appears
straw
yellow
with
a
typical
shortlived
one
finger
head
and
bland
sweet
corn
on
weak
grains
aroma
flavor
light
watery
body
but
at
least
it
is
well
carbonated
really
just
barely
a
tiny
step
above
any
bmc
you
may
encounter
but
not
quite
better
enough
to
justify
the
price
tag
imo
the
worst
are
the
people
paying
5
for
these
on
water
street
at
the
leinie
lodge
no
dude
you
arent
totally
into
bad
ass
craft
beer
its
just
a
brand
that
was
bought
by
miller
please
stop
embarrasing
yourself
o
we
initially
bought
this
and
some
1960s
schlitz
for
a
party
we
were
attending
where
thered
be
beer
pong
and
flip
cup
i
preferred
the
schlitz
at
the
time
review
forthcoming
but
am
surprised
by
how
drinkable
i
find
this
compared
to
the
pbr
i
had
recently
o
not
bad
for
the
style
better
than
the
bmc
alternative
lienenkugels
original
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
good
carbonation
that
provides
a
bubblely
white
head
bot
which
dissipate
overtime
some
lacing
was
present
the
smell
had
sweet
corn
and
light
grain
with
balance
hop
the
taste
followed
suit
sweet
corn
grain
hint
of
malt
and
hop
with
good
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
could
be
sessioned
easily
overall
it
is
a
fine
american
adjunct
beer
best
of
all
is
the
free
native
american
female
with
every
case
ymmv
mine
was
on
hand
to
assist
with
the
crack
glug
and
she
did
a
fine
job
producing
a
fingerandahalf
of
bubbly
bonewhite
head
with
moderate
retention
that
would
make
any
lodge
member
proud
color
was
a
goldenyellow
that
would
have
made
eitherboth
king
midas
and
croesus
proud
the
nose
would
make
any
local
pig
farmer
proud
given
its
distinct
resemblance
to
silage
the
mouthfeel
would
make
any
chemist
proud
given
its
resemblance
to
co2
the
taste
would
make
greg
koch
proud
since
he
revels
in
being
able
to
measure
his
beers
by
using
aals
as
his
yardstick
the
finish
would
make
a
drain
proud
as
it
either
came
from
one
or
belonged
there
no
sorry
that
last
was
too
harsh
but
i
was
at
a
loss
it
was
simply
a
standard
aal
i
remain
a
proud
member
of
the
leinie
lodge
but
i
have
better
beer
to
put
in
my
cooler
again
ymmv
ok
not
must
have
theres
a
good
mouthfeel
excellent
hopmalt
balance
and
good
drinkability
overall
the
adjunct
quality
never
detracts
too
much
from
the
beers
better
traits
and
this
is
just
about
the
right
weight
at
4
6
for
several
in
one
sitting
especially
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
tried
this
on
tap
in
a
plastic
cup
sorry
i
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
this
lager
poured
an
almost
clear
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
head
retention
is
poor
and
there
was
no
lacing
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
was
mostly
sweet
with
slight
hints
of
grain
i
didnt
pick
up
much
of
a
hop
flavor
this
for
sure
was
not
triple
hops
brewed
not
very
good
lawn
mower
beer
at
best
its
a
nice
golden
color
with
plenty
of
fizz
and
a
fat
finger
of
foam
the
aroma
was
light
with
corn
or
grain
and
some
hops
the
taste
was
some
grain
fair
amount
of
crispness
its
super
drinkable
with
a
small
amount
of
the
crispness
remaining
it
isnt
complex
not
very
distinctive
but
you
can
enjoy
it
bottle
after
bottle
this
was
the
first
bottle
of
original
ive
seen
in
the
dsm
area
so
i
hope
to
see
more
of
it
d
served
cold
its
one
of
those
beers
that
you
can
put
back
a
couple
in
a
sitting
as
ive
done
with
family
during
holiday
evenings
doing
a
formal
review
makes
me
see
some
of
the
mediocre
if
not
flawed
aspects
of
this
beer
its
a
good
bmc
substitute
it
is
quite
bubbly
in
the
mouth
a
bit
too
much
actually
the
body
is
also
quite
light
not
wretched
like
some
adjuncts
yet
unless
you
have
some
non
ba
buddies
and
it
is
on
sale
it
is
undrinkable
substandard
adjunct
lager
is
there
anything
else
to
say
its
sweet
pale
malt
which
fades
into
watery
grainy
nothingness
with
maybe
a
hop
or
two
peeking
through
its
lightbodied
and
i
drank
one
over
two
hours
of
talking
to
somebody
about
how
bad
the
job
market
is
which
is
usually
a
threebeer
conversation
i
do
not
think
these
are
all
that
similar
to
each
other
my
brother
in
a
law
is
a
miller
light
drinker
who
love
yuengling
on
vacation
im
not
surprised
he
liked
leinenkugels
more
it
is
more
like
miller
light
to
me
d
i
find
this
to
be
a
good
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
one
that
is
easy
to
put
down
and
does
make
me
want
to
have
more
not
that
i
could
say
that
about
most
adjuncts
great
in
cans
and
represents
the
style
in
good
fashion
ah
fishing
in
northern
wisconsin
the
perfect
opportunity
to
enjoy
more
leinies
than
in
any
other
situation
get
some
this
original
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
very
quicklydying
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
corn
syrup
brown
rice
and
what
the
group
collectively
agreed
was
a
mixture
of
taco
seasoning
and
jacob
leinenkugels
sweat
and
tears
no
word
on
what
happened
to
the
blood
though
count
yorga
or
iorga
to
some
is
a
suspect
the
other
cans
didnt
really
smell
this
way
nor
did
this
odor
come
out
of
the
can
itself
we
believe
the
snifter
clean
by
the
way
brought
out
some
hidden
smells
something
like
that
regardless
it
smelled
pretty
damn
awful
the
taste
mirrored
the
smell
minus
that
noxious
second
half
of
pain
though
some
tin
and
hard
water
seeped
their
way
into
the
rice
and
corn
syrup
the
body
is
very
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
not
the
best
of
choices
for
fermented
enjoyment
but
the
price
and
source
are
right
for
downing
some
brews
on
a
boat
while
attempting
to
catch
some
fish
this
was
the
main
beer
consumed
on
guys
weekend
appropriately
it
was
in
the
northwoods
of
wisconsin
just
like
this
brew
was
intended
to
be
enjoyed
the
appearance
as
expected
is
a
pale
straw
color
with
light
head
on
it
the
smell
makes
me
think
i
shouldnt
have
poured
it
into
a
glass
it
smells
of
corn
syrup
and
stale
hops
or
some
other
foul
off
smell
its
rather
sharp
on
the
nose
the
taste
has
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
which
seems
ok
for
a
pale
lager
that
it
is
other
than
that
it
tastes
similar
to
the
smell
just
a
little
less
foul
bitterness
seems
to
come
from
the
corn
syrup
but
there
is
some
malt
and
maybe
honey
in
it
that
makes
it
surprisingly
a
lot
smoother
than
i
expected
i
will
consume
a
lot
of
this
so
i
hope
its
as
drinkable
as
i
think
it
is
good
mouthfeel
here
and
i
find
this
very
drinkable
the
original
just
showed
up
in
town
and
i
quite
favour
it
for
further
sessions
md
light
body
pretty
thin
and
watery
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
pretty
easy
drinking
though
probably
would
be
one
of
my
top
adjunct
lager
choices
especially
being
pretty
local
overall
this
is
a
macro
i
can
drink
without
grimacing
thats
what
i
mean
when
i
say
best
aal
this
has
been
my
old
mans
brand
forever
i
have
good
memories
of
sneaking
them
from
the
garage
fridge
growing
up
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
not
any
head
retention
to
speak
of
just
drink
it
from
the
can
and
you
dont
have
to
care
what
it
looks
like
not
much
in
the
way
of
smell
some
light
grainy
corn
but
not
much
else
absolutly
nothing
great
about
it
but
to
quote
wendell
its
good
honest
beer
nice
crisp
coarbonation
very
drinkable
just
a
normal
yellow
beer
from
a
can
nothing
wrong
with
that
taste
is
grainy
malts
that
taste
and
feel
a
bit
stale
and
cardboardy
very
light
tasting
beer
and
certainly
corn
oriented
a
bit
too
much
fruitiness
shows
through
for
a
lager
green
apples
and
grapes
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
carbonation
is
not
that
high
for
the
style
not
too
much
to
get
excited
about
but
i
would
choose
this
over
a
bud
light
anyday
12
pack
for
10
bucks
i
might
do
that
every
once
in
a
while
for
an
adjunct
lager
one
could
do
worse
d
im
sure
many
of
us
from
wisconsin
all
have
stories
of
wild
nights
drinking
with
this
beer
in
wisconsin
this
has
a
bigger
following
than
miller
in
my
opinion
and
its
quite
enjoyable
in
just
about
any
experience
the
smooth
clean
body
makes
it
drinkable
at
just
about
any
time
or
occasion
cheers
not
much
to
this
one
as
much
as
i
had
heard
profess
to
liking
leiny
49
owner
of
the
company
very
sessionable
this
definitely
is
not
one
of
their

but
not
bad
either
i
like
to
sample
the
local
brew
wherever
i
go
this
is
good
enough
when
im
in
se
asia
this
is
beer
pin
at
its
finest
pale
clear
straw
color
not
much
head
not
much
smell
a
little
corn
same
with
the
taste
very
little
flavor
not
too
bad
but
bland
thin
body
medium
carbonation
just
a
mass
produced
beer
not
so
great
but
had
to
try
anyway
enjoy
overall
a
complete
disappointment
i
have
had
this
overseas
many
times
in
the
90s
and
when
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
i
was
hoping
to
relive
some
good
times
from
years
back
that
is
not
the
case
i
am
not
sure
if
my
palate
has
changed
or
the
beer
doesnt
travel
overseas
very
well
when
imported
not
the
best
but
drinkable
a
better
aal
than
bud
miller
and
coors
went
nicely
with
some
thai
food
but
i
doubt
i
will
make
the
effort
to
have
it
again
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
bought
this
because
i
have
not
had
it
not
because
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
an
awesome
beer
well
not
too
shabby
considering
1
it
comes
from
singapore
and
2
it
is
probably
mass
produced
and
3
it
is
probably
cheaply
made
with
cheap
ingredients
this
lager
beats
out
the
other
foreign
cheap
ass
lagers
by
quite
a
bit
still
have
to
deal
with
the
malty
cereal
cheap
flavor
but
this
one
goes
a
bit
above
with
a
smooth
mouth
feel
and
drinkability
that
i
did
not
expect
dont
get
me
wrong
this
beer
is
on
the
bottom
of
most
scales
but
overall
a
nice
effort
and
much
better
than
the
palma
loucas
and
famousas
of
the
beer
world
brew
pours
a
lighter
to
medium
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
cap
with
some
light
lacing
seen
the
aroma
is
of
some
sweet
malt
pretty
much
the
same
of
the
taste
with
what
appears
to
be
a
light
hint
of
apple
also
not
real
easy
to
drink
as
there
is
some
bitterness
for
the
finish
strange
taste
also
like
it
was
made
of
stale
grains
lighter
bodied
with
good
carbonation
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
and
of
this
style
much
either
drank
way
too
many
gallons
of
tiger
in
the
then
british
crown
colony
of
singapore
would
love
to
try
the
export
version
just
for
old
times
sake
very
solid
and
delicious
tasting
lager
tastes
great
alongside
vietnamese
food
specifically
vermicelli
noodles
and
chicken
nothing
too
spectacular
but
it
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
the
rating
state
cheap
and
satisfying
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
light
to
medium
golden
amber
with
a
thin
patchy
white
head
that
persists
light
lacng
classic
adjunct
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
hints
of
apple
and
grassy
hops
flavor
follows
light
sweet
malt
with
mild
biscuit
light
apple
a
hint
of
butter
finishes
with
light
biscuit
and
grassy
hops
light
to
medium
bodied
one
nice
thing
about
adjunct
lagers
is
that
they
are
designed
not
to
offend
and
this
is
a
bland
but
pleasant
light
lager
with
perhaps
a
bit
more
biscuit
and
light
apple
than
is
typical
to
its
benefit
not
sure
why
this
rates
at
poor
here
it
seems
to
be
right
on
the
spot
for
style
perhaps
a
bit
more
character
if
i
was
stuck
in
singapore
not
a
hot
bed
of
craft
beer
i
suspect
i
would
have
no
problem
ordering
this
tiger
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
massive
head
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
enjoyable
during
the
summer
and
its
a
beer
that
has
a
light
taste
but
still
retains
a
flavor
that
ranks
for
me
as
a
fine
asian
brew
one
that
is
much
better
than
sapporo
or
others
on
the
market
watery
stuff
what
can
i
say
about
tiger
its
the
asian
corona
light
ive
had
this
on
balmy
nyc
sumer
nights
with
friends
and
its
an
easy
drinker
best
when
cold
and
with
fried
dumplings
beats
coors
lift
anyway
when
with
the
guys
cold
tiger
on
a
hot
saigon
night
is
as
good
as
it
gets
overall
certainly
not
the
greatest
lager
you
will
ever
come
across
but
for
a
european
light
lager
style
beer
this
is
more
than
drinkable
the
flavour
is
really
rather
mild
so
if
you
want
something
with
more
punch
then
it
is
not
for
you
but
if
you
want
something
that
is
light
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
then
get
a
bottle
and
at
the
risk
of
sounding
silly
try
with
asian
food
overall
average
across
the
board
cheers
its
another
average
asian
yellow
beer
but
i
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
tiger
beer
and
not
just
because
of
my
travels
around
the
south
pacific
but
because
i
think
it
plays
an
important
role
in
the
beer
world
its
bright
carbonation
and
lack
of
metallic
flavors
makes
it
a
nice
compliment
to
the
spicy
cuisine
of
its
homeland
it
cuts
it
well
through
heat
and
seafood
flavors
and
finishes
super
clean
i
love
it
with
good
malaysian
food
because
it
cleans
up
each
bite
so
i
can
taste
it
anew
better
than
many
of
its
peers
its
mouthfeel
makes
it
work
pale
malt
flavors
a
little
watered
down
but
this
is
hard
to
beat
after
some
time
in
the
jungle
for
refreshment
and
its
also
hard
to
beat
with
authentic
thai
or
indonesian
food
too
its
clean
and
drinkable
without
the
strange
extract
sweetness
of
others
it
also
for
whatever
reason
doesnt
give
me
the
same
hangover
that
most
other
asian
beer
does
i
dont
know
why
but
it
just
seems
milder
on
the
comedown
for
me
nothing
special
obviously
below
average
of
course
in
terms
of
all
craft
beer
but
in
its
context
its
a
little
better
than
most
flavor
white
bread
dough
sweet
barley
malt
biscuit
cracker
with
some
mild
herbal
hop
flavor
overall
very
nice
lager
more
complex
than
many
pale
lagers
i
found
this
singaporean
beer
at
binnys
beverage
depot
in
chicago
and
at
feldmans
market
in
mcallen
texas
i
must
say
this
is
a
good
beer
from
asia
it
has
a
simple
but
complex
taste
goes
down
great
and
does
not
leave
you
to
bloated
it
pours
clear
with
a
light
golden
color
with
white
laces
running
up
to
the
average
head
which
dissapates
quicky
the
body
is
solid
with
decent
carbonation
and
has
decent
malt
aroma
there
is
a
slight
metalic
edge
but
is
overshadowed
by
a
malty
aftertaste
overall
ok
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
and
not
even
a
very
good
beer
but
for
what
it
is
it
isnt
terrible
of
course
there
are
other
options
at
cheaper
price
points
that
are
better
too
tiger
2
55
overall
a
beer
i
only
got
because
it
was
a
2
16oz
at
the
food
spot
i
was
at
and
i
really
wanted
a
beer
drinkable
light
with
enough
bittereness
to
freshen
you
up
thumbs
up
this
is
a
sorry
excuse
for
the
beer
no
getting
around
it
on
the
top
range
of
adjunct
lagers
very
refreshing
and
not
immediate
or
screaming
offflavors
good
beer
to
drink
at
a
tropical
beach
or
with
spicy
food
more
or
less
the
same
as
the
other
macrobrewed
lagers
maybe
a
touch
more
complexity
than
its
american
counterparts
carbonation
is
pretty
high
and
its
really
crisp
its
light
and
thin
obviously
though
not
overly
watery
considering
its
not
too
sticky
on
the
tongue
considering
the
sweetness
in
the
flavor
its
also
got
some
smoothness
to
it
o
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
all
around
it
was
boring
and
poor
in
all
categories
tiger
on
the
other
hand
tastes
like
something
has
gone
terribly
wrong
in
the
adjunct
department
kind
of
like
too
much
corn
really
spoils
a
lot
of
american
adjuncts
mostly
saw
this
in
malaysia
but
also
in
indonesia
and
elsewhere
avoid
it
overall
this
was
inoffensive
though
uneventful
as
well
just
when
i
thought
i
had
tried
the
worst
adjunct
lager
on
the
face
of
the
earth
something
else
comes
along
to
up
the
ante
like
a
number
of
other
imported
beers
of
this
style
this
one
contained
some
horrible
hop
extracts
that
made
the
finish
offensively
bitter
and
dry
this
was
a
definite
drain
pour
o
slightly
better
than
average
but
still
rather
mediocre
not
one
to
get
if
you
have
plans
to
enjoy
a
beer
at
home
but
a
better
drink
to
get
on
a
night
out
instead
of
the
common
lagers
a
little
more
flavor
than
some
adjunct
lagers
but
nothing
too
exciting
i
love
the
detroit
tigers
still
like
tiger
woods
swear
by
tiger
brand
underwear
used
to
love
tiger
beat
magazine
and
tigger
from
winnie
the
pooh
but
cant
say
im
too
fond
of
tiger
beer
lets
call
this
one
a
j
5
to
the
point
i
do
like
this
lager
it
is
like
i
said
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
a
very
good
beer
for
playing
yard
games
or
other
summer
activities
detroit
tiger
fans
should
give
this
a
try
this
beer
is
not
terrible
its
deep
gold
with
a
small
head
but
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
clean
and
crisp
with
noticeable
alcohol
just
not
that
outstanding
taste
is
not
that
strong
whats
there
is
ok
some
malt
bitterness
toward
the
end
with
a
sweeter
herbal
taste
at
first
way
too
carbonated
so
much
that
it
takes
away
from
the
taste
thats
the
biggest
flaw
i
see
this
beer
is
ok
worth
drinking
if
its
in
front
of
you
o
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
tropical
climate
and
goes
very
well
with
the
many
asian
cusines
available
in
singapore
this
is
my
first
drain
pour
after
30some
reviews
its
just
its
just
not
good
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
crystal
clear
pale
straw
color
light
carbonation
and
very
light
bodied
sweet
grainy
nose
flavor
is
sweet
corn
and
light
hops
good
lawnmower
beer
not
much
else
12oz
bottle
from
gift
specialists
oceanside
california
tiger
is
the
big
beer
from
singapore
it
tastes
mostly
like
becks
if
you
imagine
a
heavier
somewhat
breadieryeastier
somewhat
sweeter
becks
youll
get
tiger
its
not
my
favorite
beer
of
its
type
and
i
doubt
its
worth
actively
searching
out
but
its
okay
and
probably
suits
the
local
cuisine
fine
mildly
recommended
for
those
purposes
od
decent
lager
that
was
clean
but
lacking
goodness
avoids
common
faults
of
the
style
went
well
with
pizza
but
nothing
i
would
look
into
too
much
overall
not
much
going
on
here
beer
was
gone
in
a
few
sips
overall
not
bad
glad
i
went
to
a
unique
place
for
dinner
with
the
girl
and
followed
it
up
with
a
unique
beer
choice
no
socks
will
be
blown
off
but
this
went
very
well
with
my
dinner
worth
a
shot
i
am
not
blown
away
by
tiger
beer
but
i
am
not
as
upset
as
i
expected
to
be
when
we
started
reviewing
this
lager
its
clean
simple
and
boring
but
its
not
terrible
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
unless
food
was
involved
o
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
definitely
in
the
top
decile
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
the
rice
character
makes
it
interesting
and
i
would
sooner
drink
this
than
any
of
its
americanmade
peers
given
the
choice
overal
meh
not
my
thing
can
see
why
this
is
a
popular
beer
sessionable
thats
about
it
330ml
bottle
poured
into
leffe
chalice
golden
colour
head
was
tiny
and
faded
fast
clear
aroma
was
corn
rice
yeast
syrup
and
berries
tasted
corn
rice
yeast
syrup
had
a
fairly
bitter
finish
that
didnt
balance
out
the
sweetness
not
much
carbonation
texture
was
syrupy
and
thick
smooth
overall
what
you
would
expect
an
ajunct
lager
to
be
wont
be
rushing
out
to
buy
more
but
it
wasnt
offensive
it
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
frothy
head
the
smell
is
slightly
metallic
with
some
grass
lemon
and
bread
the
flavor
is
lacking
all
i
could
pick
up
was
the
typical
continental
lager
flavor
with
lots
of
bread
and
metal
really
not
too
bad
though
it
is
pretty
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
id
drink
this
beer
plenty
if
it
was
cheaper
overall
a
way
below
average
lager
i
tend
to
enjoy
most
foreign
pale
lagers
but
not
this
one
dial
back
the
dms
and
sweetness
and
it
would
be
tolerable
golden
yellow
with
very
little
head
light
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
grass
and
citrus
old
citrus
very
strange
metallic
taste
with
a
harsh
aftertaste
this
is
truly
a
horrible
beer
supposedly
the
most
popular
beer
in
singapore
id
assume
this
is
the
asian
equivalent
to
keystone
pretty
horrible
here
its
drinkable
if
its
the
only
beer
around
and
youre
coming
off
of
a
long
period
of
not
drinking
like
a
year
or
so
pours
a
clear
darker
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
mild
and
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
grassy
and
hay
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
and
slightly
metallic
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
herbal
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
but
its
drinkable
and
even
has
a
slightly
hoppy
edge
in
the
flavor
unlike
other
asian
beers
of
the
same
style
a
very
uninteresting
beer
thin
head
on
a
clear
deep
golden
body
aroma
is
light
with
breads
light
floral
grains
and
sweet
corn
flavor
is
also
fairly
bready
sweet
corn
pale
malts
and
almost
no
hop
character
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
as
far
as
american
adjunct
lagers
go
this
one
has
decent
flavor
without
off
putting
flavors
not
bad
for
what
it
is
as
the
bombersized
bottle
was
more
commonplace
during
a
recent
trip
to
singapore
i
decided
to
revisit
the
tiger
it
poured
a
pale
goldentan
with
nice
foam
still
not
much
of
an
aroma
and
the
honeyedsweet
corn
cereal
flavor
dominated
the
flavor
profile
however
the
combination
of
an
ice
cold
lager
and
the
hot
humid
temperatures
made
this
more
enjoyable
than
it
had
any
right
being
the
most
popular
beer
in
singapore
its
brewed
on
malt
from
europe
and
australia
its
developed
by
heineken
acia
pacific
breweries
started
to
brew
it
in
1931
it
got
really
popular
in
ww2
by
the
allied
groups
in
the
far
eastthe
soldiers
took
some
beers
home
to
introduce
it
lighth
yellow
lager

the
texture
is
crystal
clear
with
golden
color
along
with
small
white
foamy
head
that
dissipates
rather
swift
into
some
sheet
of
bubble
atop
visible
carbonation
is
high
and
yields
smooth
yet
refreshing
mouth
feel
through
the
palate
within
its
medium
body
the
aroma
and
taste
are
rather
clean
and
predominated
by
grain
while
malty
sweet
a
bit
husk
and
light
hop
bitterness
come
in
supporting
actually
there
is
nothing
to
remember
about
this
macro
brew
but
anyway
it
still
can
invigorate
my
day
when
i
need
to
get
something
not
too
serious
pours
a
light
soft
lemon
yellow
color
with
a
big
but
quickly
vanishing
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
unfortunately
typical
of
the
style
with
little
but
a
musty
light
bready
aroma
the
flavor
is
likewise
thin
and
common
with
a
light
grainy
sweetness
predominating
overall
this
is
a
decent
alternative
to
other
fizzy
yellow
lagers
but
it
doesnt
provide
much
pleasure
beyond
that
o
just
a
bad
lager
not
drinking
this
one
again
very
large
pillowey
white
head
over
a
effervescent
yellow
body
really
lively
head
lasts
longer
than
most
beers
aroma
is
light
spicy
hops
mild
tastes
are
balanced
but
unremarkable
fairly
creamy
palate
much
softer
carbonation
than
i
expected
from
the
appearance
good
but
nothing
great
easy
drinking
on
a
hot
day
i
went
with
an
aggro
pour
just
to
see
what
would
happen
i
got
a
fingerandahalf
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
limited
retention
color
was
a
straw
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
of
silage
hmm
what
once
was
new
is
old
again
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
filled
with
corn
finish
was
semisweet
very
cornlike
and
as
boring
as
the
old
lady
in
the
missionary
position
man
it
made
me
long
for
twister
yum
yum
you
know
lift
your
left
leg
to
blue
meh
a
runthegamut
macro
lager
nothing
special
dull
and
devoid
of
character
with
some
faint
but
unwelcome
corn
notes
probably
ok
on
a
hot
day
in
singapore
but
not
worth
spending
your
money
on
over
here
give
it
a
miss
overall
a
standard
american
adjunct
lager
with
a
slight
edge
over
the
competition
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
briskly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
good
for
an
adjunct
lager
you
can
do
a
whole
lot
worse
at
least
this
has
a
bit
of
flavor
to
it
and
finishes
clean
that
said
its
also
far
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
give
me
a
yuengling
premium
or
gannset
lager
over
this
any
day
overall
3
55
not
a
bad
lager
but
nothing
that
really
grabs
my
attention
either
o
the
light
flavors
in
this
beer
would
probably
make
it
a
nice
accompaniment
to
spicy
asian
food
o
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
was
expecting
and
i
could
see
how
it
would
pair
well
with
the
local
cuisine
in
singapore
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
which
is
what
makes
it
sessionable
i
dont
understand
why
this
beer
is
expensive
theres
nothing
to
it
really
pours
clear
straw
with
a
good
sized
head
smell
is
very
faint
mild
grainy
sweetness
taste
is
mellow
sweet
malt
just
a
little
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
low
bitterness
medium
to
light
bodied
crisp
and
well
carbonated
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
i
cant
really
find
anything
to
complain
about
it
is
very
ordinary
but
there
are
no
offnotes
overall
drinkability
probably
just
a
good
spicy
food
beer
and
thats
about
it
overallso
glad
i
got
to
try
beer
from
singapore
too
bad
it
wasnt
remotely
memorable
not
awful
but
i
cant
recommend
seeking
this
out
o
way
better
than
the
corona
i
enjoyed
on
christmas
eve
although
it
was
well
past
its
recommended
drink
by
date
just
a
hint
above
average
overall
another
beer
that
wont
knock
your
sock
off
but
it
highly
drinkable
and
pretty
refreshing
i
had
this
while
out
eating
some
spicy
food
and
it
worked
quite
well
to
cool
the
heat
o
pedestrian
lager
but
there
a
many
worse
out
there
a
decent
light
moderately
refreshing
adjunct
lager
with
a
few
lessthancrippling
flaws
drinkable
but
other
than
that
there
is
nothing
noteworthy
about
this
beer
not
really
worth
trying
unless
youre
a
pale
lager
fan
or
you
want
to
be
able
to
say
youve
had
beer
from
singapore
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
i
doubt
id
directly
purchase
it
again
maybe
ontap
d
pretty
bland
and
boring
the
flavors
arent
great
and
with
the
addition
of
the
metallic
component
is
a
bit
detracting
now
i
know
why
these
se
asian
beers
are
so
light
they
usually
wont
survive
the
hot
and
lengthy
travel
dont
bother
reviewing
them
if
youre
pulling
them
off
a
us
shelf
cause
its
not
the
crisp
clean
quaffer
you
get
in
se
asia
thats
not
to
say
this
is
something
special
fresh
out
of
the
brewery
its
just
a
very
simple
beer
meant
to
be
refreshing
after
a
long
hot
day
or
paired
w
spicy
hot
food
airport
sushi
bar
limited
beer
selection
might
as
well
give
it
a
try
overall
not
bad
for
what
it
is
which
is
a
generic
adjunct
lager
there
are
certainly
worse
examples
of
the
style
up
front
the
beer
is
clean
but
not
flavorless
with
cereal
notes
and
a
passable
amount
of
hops
nothing
memorable
or
even
particularly
worthwhile
but
not
offensive
either
next
time
id
opt
for
a
japanese
rice
lager
but
this
was
fine
for
washing
down
some
rolls
overall
im
not
impressed
and
would
not
buy
a
six
pack
or
recommend
it
to
my
buddies
o
by
no
means
terrible
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
a
can
taste
like
any
other
canadian
macro
lager
o
overall
i
like
this
better
than
say
budweiser
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
want
to
drink
this
every
day
another
country
checked
off
and
slightly
surprised
in
the
quality
this
beer
tasted
like
any
typical
lager
imagine
budweiser
with
a
little
more
flavor
the
appearance
was
very
light
and
looked
like
a
typical
adjunct
lager
there
was
hardly
any
smell
to
it
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
very
fizzy
and
light
as
the
beer
got
warmer
the
taste
got
worse
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
any
one
well
worth
the
try
a
solid
macro
lager
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
in
singapore
o
nothing
offensive
for
sure
but
nothing
memorable
either
relatively
bland
overall
i
dig
this
this
might
be
my
macro
lager
of
choice
now
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
basic
lager
that
doesnt
suck
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
faint
i
get
a
little
bit
of
unattractive
grain
notes
in
the
aroma
but
that
is
about
it
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
some
malt
and
grain
notes
not
real
hops
character
but
at
least
there
are
not
any
real
off
flavors
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
a
beer
i
will
try
again
had
this
in
a
12
ounce
can
at
the
macau
tower
in
macau
least
expensive
item
i
purchased
in
macau
15
mop
or
about
2
00
usd
it
was
a
typical
macro
lager
light
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
poured
a
fizzy
yellow
into
my
glass
light
white
head
that
quickly
receded
aroma
of
grain
and
some
faint
grassy
hops
taste
was
light
and
cornlike
with
hints
of
bread
dough
and
some
faint
bittering
was
refreshing
enough
in
the
steamy
morass
that
is
macau
it
does
however
avoid
the
pitfall
of
being
harsh
in
flavor
only
to
fall
into
the
pitfall
of
having
too
little
flavor
watery
and
thin
in
feel
at
least
it
is
carbonated
correctly
and
refreshing
to
drink
but
than
again
so
is
plain
water
maybe
its
better
with
food
i
have
to
say
im
surprised
maybe
even
astonished
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
at
how
little
i
hate
this
its
fairly
bland
but
its
inoffensive
unpretentious
and
very
drinkable
waiting
in
the
singapore
airlines
lounge
waiting
for
flight
to
jakarta
and
they
had
tiger
on
tap
poured
into
a
refrigerated
mug
the
appearance
was
ok
clear
golden
color
with
some
carbonation
that
frothed
to
a
nice
head
which
has
dissapated
to
very
thin
the
smell
is
balanced
meaning
not
much
going
on
but
not
overpowered
by
grain
which
is
common
for
american
adjuct
lagers
the
taste
is
quite
different
then
other
beers
of
this
style
this
beer
has
a
interesting
malt
character
that
changes
the
taste
somewhat
its
a
decent
beer
and
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
would
be
afraid
of
the
hangover
from
this
one
maybe
it
was
that
i
just
really
needed
a
cold
beer
at
the
time
stay
away
you
have
been
warned
if
youre
coming
to
singapore
try
it
once
youll
be
disappointed
head
to
restaurants
with
craft
brews
i
think
the
water
we
have
here
is
too
clean
and
soft
for
good
brews
had
this
with
spicy
chinese
food
a
bomber
in
short
i
could
close
my
eyes
and
think
tis
a
bmc
overall
its
nothing
special
at
all
i
am
sure
if
i
was
surfing
in
bali
i
would
be
all
over
this
this
beer
needs
to
be
as
cold
as
can
be
once
it
warms
up
at
all
the
flavors
go
south
in
a
hurry
not
worht
a
try
unless
in
bali
o
offaroma
but
ok
taste
body
could
use
a
little
work
pours
a
light
golden
semi
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
just
a
tad
of
simple
lacing
smells
of
straw
paper
hay
and
a
little
bit
of
corn
adjunct
and
some
sweetness
tastes
of
a
little
mellow
barely
bitter
hops
corn
oils
and
some
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
it
isnt
bad
for
its
style
but
not
something
i
would
ever
consider
decent
picked
this
one
up
pretty
much
to
just
finish
filling
a
6
pack
up
mostly
this
beer
is
like
many
other
lagers
im
sure
its
got
hops
barley
and
malts
in
it
but
to
what
extreme
are
they
putting
in
anyway
the
beer
is
pee
yellow
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
no
hop
aroma
unfortunately
this
beer
is
rather
bland
with
something
as
wild
as
a
tiger
on
the
label
should
this
brew
be
a
little
more
aggressive
o
not
the
best
asian
lager
ive
had
by
a
long
stretch
avoid
the
flavor
is
sweet
definitely
all
maltiness
a
little
corn
a
little
citrus
maybe
the
hop
content
is
subdued
tiger
is
smooth
and
easytodrink
and
though
its
pretty
unremarkable
this
one
fares
better
than
most
american
adjuncts
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
no
noticeable
alcohol
either
so
if
you
dont
mind
the
sugar
drink
up
rjt
d
very
downable
and
good
enough
for
the
1
worth
it
perhaps
but
not
anything
id
really
drink
not
recommended
unless
youre
eating
asian
food
and
dont
want
to
think
about
drinking
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
quickly
disappearing
white
soda
like
head
surprisingly
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
there
are
lots
of
grains
and
a
bit
of
grass
in
the
nose
there
is
a
small
amount
of
hops
in
the
middle
of
the
nose
then
it
finishes
with
a
metallic
flavor
the
taste
is
grainy
and
a
little
sweet
it
ends
clean
with
a
bitter
tinge
its
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
very
crisp
and
sudsy
drinkability
is
great
nothing
offensive
one
of
the
best
american
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
actually
i
was
surprised
at
this
one
this
is
certainly
not
the
best
american
adjunct
lager
but
its
a
cut
above
many
of
them
d
very
good
mild
with
a
lightmedium
body
easy
to
drink
ironic
how
the
best
aals
ive
had
have
been
produced
outside
the
us
d
better
than
budweiser
but
not
by
much
overall
for
a
lager
very
good
its
plain
compared
to
my
favourite
overall
beers
but
still
good
d
now
i
know
most
people
bash
these
mass
produced
beers
but
picture
yourself
in
singapore
with
a
hot
laksa
drinking
tiger
beer
it
would
go
down
a
treat
this
is
a
good
clean
inoffensive
lager
that
is
of
a
good
quality
see
more
at
abarwithnoname

com
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
for
whatever
thats
worth
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
i
would
rather
drink
if
my
choices
were
that
limited
the
taste
and
drinkability
are
the
standouts
of
tiger
i
really
enjoy
the
flavor
its
a
lot
like
any
other
light
tasting
asian
beer
but
im
a
fan
of
asian
beers
tastes
of
straw
and
hops
a
pretty
average
and
normal
flavor
d
decent
for
this
price
level
compared
to
budweiser
and
other
american
macrolagers
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
nothing
special
would
probably
go
well
with
a
spicy
food
however
its
very
cheap
quality
and
lacking
of
flavor
could
get
the
same
thing
with
a
domestic
american
beer
pick
one
bud
miller
coors
etc
they
all
are
chaep
flavorless
but
effective
drinkability
give
me
this
with
lots
of
singaporean
spicy
food
during
the
hot
weather
of
chinese
new
year
in
singapore
i
would
gladly
say
that
im
in
heaven
would
pick
this
up
for
some
heart
to
heart
talk
session
with
friends
back
in
singapore
overseas
yes
only
if
the
price
is
lower
or
same
as
in
singapore
this
beer
aint
cheap
in
us
or
aussie
all
the
typical
pieces
are
there
from
the
light
look
to
the
light
taste
to
the
easy
consumption
this
is
a
standard
drinkwhileyouwatchfootball
taste
which
you
can
easily
avoid
for
much
smaller
prices
this
is
only
good
for
the
labelvarietytiger
and
otherwise
bud
itself
does
the
job
and
its
american
d
drinkable
because
it
is
bland
its
not
doing
it
for
me
what
it
does
is
fit
the
mold
of
a
proper
pilsner
unfailingly
theres
enough
pleasant
taste
and
palatepleasing
character
to
recommend
it
i
think
i
will
drink
this
one
more
than
once
md
medium
carbonation
light
bodied
with
a
watery
thinness
goes
down
easy
enough
though
overall
for
the
style
it
was
not
terrible
but
compared
to
my
normal
fair
i
will
pass
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
bbq
picnic
beer
promo
at
a
bar
its
no
surprise
that
one
of
the
worlds
leading
financial
centers
should
brew
a
beer
that
is
so
clearly
rooted
in
values
of
economy
and
efficiency
brewed
according
to
concerns
of
scale
and
cost
one
that
discounts
taste
and
quality
all
but
entirely
well
tiger
brewery
let
me
say
this
to
you
in
a
language
you
can
understand
no
repeat
purchase
md
typical
macro
d
fairly
basic
lager
could
be
drank
steadily
if
desired
but
nothing
special
d
smoothe
drinkable
no
offensive
flavours
very
average
but
it
would
work
well
on
a
blazingly
hot
day
i
think
id
prefer
something
with
a
cleaner
profile
but
this
will
do
if
youre
stuck
in
a
virtual
beer
desert
nothing
to
see
here
as
adjuncts
go
i
have
certainly
tried
better
for
cheaper
and
more
local
not
a
fan
but
some
people
like
the
exoticness
of
it
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
fluffy
white
head
it
is
yellow
in
color
it
smells
sweet
and
grainygrassy
better
than
i
expected
the
taste
is
sweet
but
it
seems
to
have
that
bitter
metal
taste
i
get
a
lot
in
imported
lagers
this
isnt
as
bad
as
some
other
imported
lagers
but
it
isnt
going
to
be
making
it
into
my
rotation
d
not
bad
extremely
watery
beer
should
come
with
a
bit
more
hops
d
an
average
mass
produced
lager
but
the
skunked
sweet
popcorn
notes
make
this
a
poorer
example
drinkability
nothing
at
all
about
this
beer
stands
out
it
isnt
bad
but
its
definitely
not
good
either
i
probably
wouldnt
have
this
again
md
easy
drinker
reminds
me
of
a
macro
brew
dont
need
to
name
names
we
can
figure
out
which
ones
slight
citrus
sweetness
but
almost
not
that
noticeable
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
reminded
me
to
much
of
a
macro
brew
d
not
too
bad
this
would
be
great
with
asian
food
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
definately
sessionable
thought
im
not
sure
i
ever
will
this
was
probably
a
one
timer
ive
gotta
give
credit
its
better
than
many
other
adjuncts
that
ive
had
in
the
past
d
avoid
unless
its
all
thats
available
or
you
really
just
dont
give
a
damn
d
average
to
below
its
the
smell
that
puts
me
off
this
beer
everytime
d
as
asian
lagers
go
this
is
workable
good
for
a
hot
day
and
want
to
quench
your
thirst
quickly
one
is
good
enough
to
suffice
a
little
too
much
sweetness
to
do
more
than
2
though
as
would
get
an
upset
stomach
from
the
sugar
and
corn
best
way
to
go
with
this
beer
is
pair
it
with
stuff
like
salt
and
pepper
squid
crab
or
some
spicy
asian
dish
much
better
beer
when
paired
with
food
and
far
more
sessionable
with
the
right
foods
also
a
half
to
a
full
letter
grade
better
when
paired
with
the
right
foods
nothin
better
than
drinking
an
asian
aal
while
watching
some
lowgrade
chop
socky
shaolin
exmonk
to
be
exact
the
clear
very
pale
straw
is
just
as
bland
and
unexciting
as
the
dubbed
dialogue
im
being
forced
to
listen
to
if
only
this
brew
had
such
an
awesome
fake
moustache
as
this
guy
here
ah
without
visuals
that
didnt
work
as
well
as
id
hoped
but
trust
me
its
a
cool
fake
moustache
and
those
sound
effects
every
movement
of
an
arm
or
leg
produces
a
beast
of
a
whoosh
just
as
unsatisfying
as
the
weak
ricy
corny
almost
metallically
sour
nose
on
this
thing
along
side
the
usual
corn
syrup
toasted
rice
and
baked
wheat
tastes
is
a
hint
of
vague
blunt
bitterness
with
a
tiny
bit
of
tinny
edge
wow
do
these
attempts
at
physical
comedy
suck
and
in
the
best
way
now
as
lame
as
the
taste
is
as
is
this
movie
at
least
its
nice
and
light
both
in
body
and
in
carbonation
and
goes
down
easily
allowing
it
to
be
done
with
quickly
if
only
this
movie
would
move
along
so
easily
it
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
to
taste
bad
really
but
its
also
not
good
its
probably
not
the
worst
of
the
style
ive
had
but
it
hardly
stands
out
poured
into
a
pint
glass
where
the
foamy
head
disappeared
in
mere
moments
leaving
no
head
atop
a
straw
yellow
lager
the
nose
was
what
you
have
come
to
expect
from
a
lager
sweet
without
bitterness
the
beer
itself
initially
comes
across
as
a
smooth
finishing
lager
but
gives
up
a
metallic
aftertaste
over
time
that
kills
any
flavours
within
the
beer
no
evidence
this
beer
ever
came
into
contact
with
a
hop
either
the
carbonation
is
low
which
contributes
a
terribly
thin
mouthfeel
waterlike
in
its
consistency
dpretty
drinkable
due
to
its
water
consistency
and
no
offensive
flavors
if
you
are
at
an
asian
restaurant
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
decision
to
try
it
what
makes
this
rise
above
what
is
expected
is
that
this
simply
tastes
solid
the
cheapy
sweetness
one
would
expect
is
nowhere
to
be
found
instead
there
is
a
nice
crispness
and
lack
of
thinness
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
permeates
giving
this
some
sense
of
body
true
nothing
spectacular
but
this
is
better
than
90
of
the
crap
american
mexican
euro
and
asian
brews
not
to
say
this
is
the
best
crap
brew
at
this
price
i
found
a
damn
good
asian
lager
that
sizzles
out
most
japanese
and
chinese
beers
ive
had
maybe
this
was
just
a
lucky
bottle
worth
a
try
beats
the
u
s
macro
market
with
ease
overall
i
would
choose
this
over
most
other
crappy
beers
but
i
would
never
buy
this
if
given
a
choice
this
shouldnt
even
be
a
beer
in
germany
as
the
ingredient
list
reveals
sugar
the
smell
is
sharp
and
discordant
it
tastes
like
a
sweeter
version
of
the
style
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
syrupy
but
not
necessarily
unpleasant
pretty
decent
with
spicy
food
d
pretty
much
run
of
the
mill
for
me
seems
better
than
bmc
due
to
slightly
more
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
and
a
touch
more
hop
bitterness
easy
going
easy
drinking
i
could
have
thought
it
was
a
light
beer
if
it
wasnt
5
abv
md
nothing
special
but
given
the
alternatives
this
is
a
good
session
beer
in
a
place
far
from
home
especially
when
the
pool
tables
are
free
appearance
is
light
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
crisp
head
smell
has
nothing
that
really
stands
out
light
grains
and
hop
taste
has
the
adjuct
and
then
leaves
your
mouth
with
a
light
bitter
dryness
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
nothing
special
but
not
bad
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
it
is
an
easily
consumed
brew
despite
the
spicy
note
if
you
ever
travel
on
air
singapore
you
will
get
to
drink
plenty
of
this
i
promise
drinkability
perhaps
this
goes
well
with
chicken
rice
who
knows
but
i
doubt
ill
be
drinking
this
again
anytime
soon
not
terrible
but
one
of
the
lower
rated
beers
i
tried
this
weekend
dont
think
ill
ever
get
it
again
d
its
ok
thats
about
the
best
i
can
say
keep
it
cold
to
stop
what
little
flavor
there
is
from
going
down
hill
carbonation
is
way
too
strong
and
the
body
is
very
watery
i
was
skeptical
about
this
brew
and
rightfully
so
it
was
a
pretty
gold
color
with
medium
carbonation
it
smelled
of
wheat
the
taste
was
wheat
and
slightly
acidic
on
the
aftertaste
it
had
almost
no
lacing
at
all
i
noticed
a
few
hours
later
that
same
acidic
feeling
in
my
throat
was
still
there
this
will
not
be
a
repeat
purchase
overall
a
macro
lager
plain
and
simple
but
it
did
help
to
add
a
little
more
vividness
to
some
memories
so
well
worth
the
10
for
the
sixer
even
though
its
15
that
price
in
nam
haha
had
in
a
thai
restaurant
very
limited
choices
with
soup
and
salad
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
pale
golden
yellow
and
typical
of
most
asian
beers
had
little
nose
or
taste
however
as
with
a
lot
of
those
it
was
not
overly
disgusting
either
just
a
cold
way
to
wash
down
spicy
food
all
in
all
i
think
this
tiger
beer
would
probably
be
one
of
the
most
likely
adjunct
lagers
i
would
be
willing
to
pick
up
if
its
fresh
served
cold
in
a
pilsener
glass
and
drank
quickly
it
can
be
a
pretty
decent
lager
for
an
adjunct
lager
kind
of
impressed
appearance
is
average
a
bit
more
golden
than
most
of
the
others
smell
is
ok
nothing
really
prominent
but
very
clean
and
no
skunkiness
taste
is
nice
some
mild
maltiness
and
thats
about
it
mouthfeel
is
right
on
par
for
the
style
drinkability
was
good
notes
overall
its
not
bad
at
all
for
a
pale
lager
seemed
like
the
japanese
budweiser
next
standard
lager
from
asia
tart
smell
golden
color
med
carbonation
sour
grainy
taste
thats
it
its
a
decent
choice
when
youre
in
se
asia
otherwise
just
ok
the
brew
is
very
popular
in
thailand
and
singapore
but
the
time
for
tiger
may
be
just
once
gold
color
and
pretty
clear
loads
of
tiny
prickle
that
looks
like
you
plunked
an
alkaseltzer
in
the
glass
some
light
lacing
and
rim
of
foam
the
aroma
explodes
out
of
the
bottle
and
the
glass
as
its
poured
very
grainy
and
little
bit
sour
on
that
nose
mostly
grains
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
little
sour
in
the
nose
category
those
hops
must
be
what
they
triple
hop
a
very
popular
macrobrew
with
as
there
is
not
much
of
it
in
the
flavor
the
attack
is
clean
and
much
maltier
than
i
had
anticipated
all
of
the
grain
and
hops
of
the
nose
are
really
absent
from
the
flavor
and
i
am
somewhat
let
down
even
the
sour
tones
would
have
been
welcome
average
to
slightly
above
on
the
mouthfeel
as
its
a
little
thicker
than
most
beers
of
this
category
and
thicker
than
you
would
assume
from
its
appearance
and
smell
pretty
clean
and
straightforward
not
bad
but
not
noteworthy
maybe
average
to
a
shade
below
it
would
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
on
the
golf
course
or
the
softball
field
i
bet
it
makes
me
think
of
something
that
you
might
drink
after
a
hard
day
of
construction
or
landscaping
it
made
me
hearken
back
to
my
college
summers
of
construction
work
just
down
the
hatch
and
start
looking
for
another
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
begs
you
to
do
what
a
lager
beer
wants
you
to
do
drink
another
and
another
and
another
seriously
a
clean
crisp
lager
beer
for
those
times
when
you
really
dont
want
to
be
overwhelmed
by
taste
flavor
smell
etc
a
fair
beer
reasonably
priced
nothing
more
and
what
is
it
with
animals
on
labels
of
massproduced
lager
moosehead
antarctica
tiger
are
the
marketers
aware
of
the
animalpiss
jokes
if
the
beer
is
substandard
to
the
consumer
while
this
seems
to
fulfill
the
trope
of
working
well
with
various
spicy
southeast
asian
cuisines
on
its
own
its
pretty
below
average
even
for
this
generally
less
than
impressive
style
id
love
to
say
that
this
beer
is
really
good
but
its
just
not
still
it
has
a
cool
bottle
cap
so
collectors
have
something
to
look
forward
to
and
honestly
there
are
worse
beers
on
the
market
im
glad
i
only
grabbed
one
of
these
badboys
though
as
i
dont
anticipate
going
back
for
more
any
time
soon
not
bad
really
its
a
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
nothing
that
will
offend
anybody
and
is
pretty
drinkable
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
many
macros
we
have
here
i
think
id
choose
this
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
pale
gold
color
with
virtually
no
head
there
is
a
sweetness
in
the
aroma
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
not
overly
flavorful
feels
a
little
watery
in
the
mouth
goes
down
very
smooth
and
quickly
i
drank
this
on
tap
in
singapore
and
remember
it
was
quite
tasty
overall
a
good
mild
tasting
beer
pours
a
shiney
bright
yellow
with
small
column
of
sluggish
bubbles
and
no
head
the
aroma
is
nothing
i
smell
nothing
thats
not
terrible
but
i
do
expect
a
little
aroma
in
a
beer
the
taste
some
super
faint
toasted
pilsner
malt
indian
corn
and
grassy
hops
hasa
grainy
grist
feel
upfront
then
leaves
a
watery
adjunct
finish
a
beer
that
isnt
bad
and
you
can
drin
and
not
think
about
pours
medium
yellow
somewhat
like
urine
when
dehydrated
very
skunky
smell
with
not
the
faintest
hint
of
typical
beer
aromas
tastes
of
alcohol
and
not
much
else
lots
of
glycerine
and
clashing
sour
and
sweet
tones
foul
aftertaste
and
unpleasant
reminders
for
hours
after
drinking
thanks
to
the
flavours
reappearing
in
burps
i
wouldnt
drink
this
at
gunpoint
ok
maybe
i
would
but
only
if
on
tap
and
very
very
cold
mouthfeel
is
watery
light
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
not
excessive
enough
to
be
prickly
or
biting
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
so
easy
you
may
not
realize
that
you
had
a
beer
at
all
in
a
word
boring
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
and
drinkability
is
average
i
only
plan
on
drinking
if
nothing
else
is
available
or
if
i
cant
afford
anything
else
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
most
likely
wont
buy
it
again
as
there
are
often
much
better
beers
available
in
the
uk
at
low
prices
overall
a
must
if
in
singapore
when
eating
at
the
hauka
but
otherwise
just
your
average
asian
brew
mouthfeel
is
thin
on
body
and
higher
in
carbonation
than
i
would
prefer
drinkability
is
good
in
the
sense
that
its
a
lawnmower
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
out
6
packs
for
regular
consumption
that
said
if
its
fresh
i
would
choose
it
over
american
macro
lagers
like
bud
any
time
d
clean
finish
pretty
tasteless
but
honestly
great
for
a
muggy
afternoon
at
orchard
towers
wanted
something
totally
different
and
on
the
light
side
while
having
lunch
with
friends
so
i
ordered
a
bottle
dont
see
this
on
menus
too
often
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
yellow
color
with
a
slight
hint
of
orange
decent
head
but
faded
fast
slight
bit
of
lacing
smelled
a
bit
malty
and
yes
it
tasted
like
an
average
lager
but
it
had
a
bit
of
malt
backbone
that
allowed
it
to
stand
on
its
own
a
bit
not
great
but
not
horrible
slightly
sticky
aftertaste
though
easy
to
drink
not
forgettable
probably
would
be
good
with
asian
food
decent
midday
drink
but
not
something
to
order
at
a
place
with
better
choices
uninspired
poured
a
12oz
beer
into
my
maredsous
chalice
this
beer
pours
a
corn
yellow
with
a
pretty
supple
head
for
the
style
its
pretty
creamy
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
as
the
beer
recedes
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
what
i
consider
mildly
generically
sweet
there
really
isnt
that
canned
corn
aroma
that
comes
with
most
macro
lagers
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
mix
between
heineken
and
bud
select
it
has
a
bit
of
a
sulfuric
funk
and
bland
canned
corn
sweetness
also
there
is
an
odd
aspartame
chemicallyness
to
it
also
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
just
a
touch
of
dryness
as
with
all
macro
lagers
i
think
its
pretty
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
oh
come
on
its
not
so
bad
really
though
it
leaves
me
wishing
i
had
some
tasty
asian
grub
to
wash
it
down
with
drinkability
some
of
the
beers
i
have
had
in
india
and
asia
are
so
bad
that
i
can
not
even
finish
one
so
with
a
decent
level
of
smoothness
and
a
light
sweet
character
i
would
put
this
ahead
of
those
in
terms
of
tolerability
that
said
it
certainly
is
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
and
i
would
probably
laugh
at
anyone
drinking
it
in
the
u
s
as
an
import
pours
like
a
typical
macrolager
yellow
with
a
thin
pure
white
head
the
head
sticks
around
as
a
thin
cap
smells
of
adjuncts
but
relatively
clean
and
not
too
sweet
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
there
is
a
slight
graininess
that
comes
through
as
well
some
very
slight
hops
on
the
finish
that
are
mostly
overwhelmed
by
the
adjunct
sweetness
not
terrible
but
a
bit
too
sweet
and
uninspired
the
carbonation
is
right
but
it
would
be
crisper
without
the
adjuncts
just
okay
one
of
those
beers
you
end
up
drinking
at
an
asian
restaurant
because
the
other
options
are
worse
meh
a
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
a
macro
lager
got
turned
on
to
this
one
in
asia
and
like
to
have
a
few
with
spicy
asian
foods
i
would
have
a
hard
time
pairing
that
with
a
russian
imperial
stout
or
many
of
my
other
favorite
beers
d
its
a
very
average
beer
i
wouldnt
pay
the
premium
price
for
this
import
when
many
of
the
more
common
domestic
or
canadian
lagers
are
of
the
same
quality
at
a
better
price

com20090112delhibestpubfood
overall
not
great
nonetheless
a
clean
adjunct
lager
comparable
to
miller
etc
d
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
lacked
anything
worth
remembering
but
not
terrible
drinkable
if
youre
looking
for
something
light
without
too
much
flavor
d
very
drinkable
especially
with
thai
food
pretty
drinkable
misc
lager
i
dont
have
many
light
lager
favorites
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
nothing
special
much
better
lagers
out
there
d
meh
for
the
style
it
isnt
that
bad
sure
there
are
macros
id
rather
have
but
if
this
was
all
that
was
available
i
wouldnt
really
suffer
im
glad
i
tried
something
from
asia
this
is
the
typical
asian
attempt
at
american
style
macro
beer
its
got
that
nasty
smell
thats
associated
with
the
style
too
however
its
the
best
beer
in
asia
and
it
tastes
more
like
a
malt
liquor
than
beer
looks
like
im
in
the
minority
here
but
i
thought
this
beer
was
well
above
average
got
mine
in
a
6
pack
of
bottles
from
our
local
hyvee
supermarket
and
poured
in
to
a
glass
the
most
noticeable
attribute
of
this
one
for
me
was
that
it
was
extremely
smooth
and
crisp
i
found
it
to
be
one
of
the
smoothest
lagers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
it
was
sort
of
heavy
though
so
not
the
best
choice
for
a
long
session
beer
it
had
a
very
non
obtrusive
aroma
almost
nothing
there
i
think
that
contributes
to
the
overall
appeal
to
me
if
your
looking
for
a
smooth
crisp
somewhat
filling
beer
without
the
hoppyness
or
odor
of
other
beer
styles
that
might
be
this
thick
this
is
a
good
bet
would
go
well
with
spicy
thai
food
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
looking
for
it
outside
a
restaurant
type
venue
had
this
with
some
cambodian
food
certainly
addressed
the
fire
curry
and
multispiced
dish
by
cleaning
the
palate
without
taking
away
from
the
food
not
something
id
knock
a
6er
down
on
but
if
you
find
yourself
in
a
particular
restaurant
give
it
a
try
it
works
with
the
cuisine
this
beer
poured
a
deep
yellow
with
a
twofinger
head
that
didnt
last
long
and
some
aggressive
carbonation
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
a
lot
of
the
corn
adjunct
thats
prominent
in
american
macrostyle
beers
the
taste
is
sweet
bread
with
a
little
bit
of
corn
that
doesnt
linger
and
leaves
next
to
no
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
if
a
bit
watery
id
say
where
this
beer
shines
is
its
drinkability
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
would
probably
make
a
good
companion
beer
to
some
spicy
food
or
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
was
the
last
beer
i
had
on
my
way
home
from
bali
when
we
stopped
overnight
in
kuala
lumpur
what
a
way
to
end
a
trip
the
tiger
poured
very
clear
with
a
pale
gold
colour
the
white
cap
disappeared
fast
leaving
a
few
fizzy
soapy
bubbles
behind
the
aroma
was
mild
and
inoffensive
just
a
little
sweet
with
a
clean
yeast
profile
and
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
very
mild
bitterness
sweet
with
some
grain
and
faint
hop
character
it
also
seemed
to
be
a
bit
sour
with
some
acidity
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
carbonation
light
bodied
and
dry
co2
was
crisp
not
a
bad
beer
in
the
heat
but
theres
not
much
here
as
far
as
character
a
decent
industrial
lager
just
not
something
id
go
looking
for
not
at
all
impressed
with
this
but
i
honestly
didnt
think
i
would
be
except
as
a
bland
shit
beer
still
i
can
find
shit
beers
that
were
at
least
brewed
in
this
country
for
less
money
that
are
still
better
tasting
than
this
tiger
more
like
that
pissy
prima
donna
housecat
one
might
have
encountered
as
a
child
at
their
dotty
aunts
house
d
i
cant
do
it
itll
make
me
vomit
especially
after
a
night
of
good
drinking
at
mahars
d
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
color
lager
with
a
large
pure
white
foamy
head
with
some
good
retention
but
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
sweet
malt
with
some
minimal
adjunct
showing
taste
is
also
dominated
by
a
bland
medium
sweet
malt
taste
with
no
easily
discernable
adjunct
not
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
but
definitely
not
the
worst
pale
lager
out
there
drinkability
average
and
a
little
bit
refreshing
pretty
easy
drinker
although
its
not
really
anything
creative
it
still
tastes
pretty
good
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
medium
quickly
disappearing
head
on
a
lager
yellow
faint
sweet
smell
at
the
end
but
other
than
that
it
smelled
and
tasted
very
unremarkable
had
a
nice
smoothness
however
went
down
pretty
easily
not
bad
but
nothing
exciting
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
yet
nothing
above
and
beyond
this
is
a
fairly
straightforward
beer
the
flavor
is
very
clean
with
light
sweet
bready
malts
theres
nothing
offensive
on
the
palate
unlike
so
many
macros
and
theres
a
pleasant
bitter
aftertaste
no
hop
flavor
but
well
balanced
i
guess
thats
really
what
this
beer
excels
at
being
balanced
there
isnt
a
lot
to
taste
but
what
there
is
is
quite
nice
and
easy
to
drink
haha
this
is
beer
got
this
one
cause
nothing
else
was
available
shockingly
this
waterbrew
costs
6
at
a
cheapo
bar
in
dc
pours
straw
nose
is
not
there
really
and
for
that
matter
neither
is
the
taste
one
of
the
blandest
beers
ive
ever
tasted
which
would
really
make
it
highly
drinkable
certainly
not
objectionable
as
a
drink
although
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
flavor
i
might
go
elsewhere
pours
a
pale
fizzy
yellow
smells
lightly
of
grain
smooth
and
relatively
flavorful
asian
macrolager
this
would
get
comparatively
high
points
if
imbibing
a
single
tiger
did
not
already
start
to
give
me
a
mild
headache
theres
rumors
of
this
and
other
asian
beers
using
formaline
as
a
fining
agent
i
dont
know
if
thats
true
but
the
headaches
are
real
as
a
result
i
give
it
a
1
for
drinkability
the
flavor
is
reasonable
but
i
could
not
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
without
risking
myself
pain
d
one
of
my
favorite
macros
a
definite
session
beer
for
hot
days
d
this
is
one
of
those
below
average
beers
its
designed
for
the
mass
audience
and
little
more
not
the
worst
macrobrew
ive
ever
had
but
this
doesnt
make
it
good
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
is
okay
its
crisp
and
might
be
remotely
tolerable
on
a
hot
day
but
drinkability
is
severely
limited
by
its
lack
of
flavor
overall
its
not
a
good
beer
cant
recommend
it
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
pale
lager
d
not
a
bad
asian
lager
like
most
asian
beers
this
is
pretty
unimpressive
but
its
head
and
shoulders
above
similar
american
beers
would
do
well
with
spicy
asian
cuisine
honestly
you
might
as
well
get
bud
light
there
is
no
wonderful
aroma
permeating
from
the
open
pop
top
but
as
you
sip
the
tanins
unlock
and
a
mild
flavor
erupts
barley
detectable
the
coloration
is
like
weak
piss
but
after
a
lengthy
session
with
my
band
members
in
the
ill
mayhem
we
decided
to
try
this
sigaporean
classic
this
was
a
shock
to
our
eastern
mores
nonetheless
we
will
sample
this
again
int
he
future
d
not
a
very
good
beer
one
of
very
few
that
will
be
poured
out
cant
even
finish
11
2
ounces
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
has
flavor
and
accomplishes
the
task
of
remaining
light
in
body
while
staying
flavorful
and
not
watered
down
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
very
boring
even
for
a
macro
lager
but
being
boring
it
is
not
offensive
either
a
straw
colored
brew
with
modest
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
lacing
has
a
bit
of
diacetyl
in
the
nose
but
not
in
the
taste
lively
carbonation
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
easy
to
drink
and
it
would
probably
appeal
to
people
who
only
drink
this
kind
of
stuff
it
looks
pretty
good
but
it
is
basically
a
standard
american
macro
lager
it
is
crisp
pretty
refreshing
etc
but
in
the
end
is
pretty
boring
and
unimpressive
not
worth
the
purchase
another
boring
asian
beer
tried
this
at
my
local
chinese
restaurant
pours
a
yellow
color
a
head
can
be
forced
by
no
matter
goes
away
to
a
smooth
surface
not
much
taste
more
carbonation
than
anything
a
little
bit
of
hops
even
less
taste
than
our
macros
not
worth
repeating
d
not
bad
i
suppose
for
how
inoffensive
and
bland
it
is
overall
it
is
reminiscent
of
bud
light
with
lawn
clippings
in
it
i
guess
if
you
want
a
macro
this
probably
isnt
too
bad
of
a
choice
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
small
head
and
little
carbonation
opening
it
i
noticed
a
skunky
aroma
very
pilsner
like
smell
is
of
corn
and
skunkiness
and
water
a
tiny
hop
note
is
barely
distinguishable
taste
is
almost
nonexistent
mostly
just
water
it
isnt
any
better
than
budweiser
really
might
actually
be
worse
d
not
bad
decent
macro
pours
as
is
expected
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
smells
as
expected
slightly
bitter
and
sweet
flavor
is
as
expected
slightly
bitter
tone
to
a
beer
that
has
a
mild
sweetness
to
it
tastes
watered
down
on
the
end
as
no
significant
traits
hang
around
feel
is
standard
drinkable
sure
why
bother
though
a
standard
macro
but
hey
at
least
i
add
another
country
to
my
growing
list
the
appearance
was
average
nothing
out
of
the
oridnary
which
was
true
for
much
of
the
beer
but
while
swirling
it
around
my
mouth
it
was
at
its
highest
point
overall
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
with
a
cool
logo
d
i
suppose
if
needs
be
this
could
be
used
as
a
standard
bland
lager
to
relax
with
but
it
is
really
unremarkable
so
i
would
not
recommend
it
drinkability
better
than
most
lagers
available
on
the
chinese
mainland
d
sure
not
the
most
interesting
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
not
horrible
either
and
quite
refreshing
on
a
warm
summers
eve
m
a
light
to
medium
body
brew
with
a
sour
aftertaste
all
that
said
i
suppose
this
is
drinkable
with
a
spicy
thai
or
malay
dish
for
a
macro
lager
this
is
pretty
damn
good
and
i
think
it
is
very
underrated
on
this
site
it
is
a
refreshing
lager
that
is
mostly
absent
of
offflavours
and
is
more
interesting
and
better
quality
than
almost
every
other
macro
ive
tried
its
a
bit
pricey
though
as
the
same
money
would
buy
some
pretty
decent
ales
from
australian
micro
breweries
that
are
clearly
superior
to
this
beer
still
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
and
would
pretty
much
never
say
no
to
one
beer
poured
a
mid
amber
colour
with
a
rather
thick
creamy
head
that
disappeared
quite
quickly
it
smelled
clean
and
fresh
with
citrusy
notes
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
a
lot
like
the
bottom
of
a
canoe
close
to
water
but
it
does
have
some
flavour
that
builds
and
a
slight
bitterness
to
its
aftertaste
it
is
quite
light
on
mouthfeel
but
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
tasty
brew
nice
light
balance
very
refreshing
d
highly
drinkable
beer
the
balance
of
the
body
and
flavors
make
it
that
way
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
pours
a
very
clear
slightly
amber
tint
fizzy
white
head
settles
very
quickly
heavy
carbonation
aroma
is
fairly
plain
some
light
malty
notes
that
give
an
applelike
smell
but
nothing
memorable
tastes
is
almost
nonexistent
some
faint
watered
down
malty
sweetness
no
hops
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
with
some
faint
fizzyness
on
the
finish
drinkability
is
the
one
area
where
this
beer
shines
to
me
its
very
eazy
to
drink
and
would
pair
well
with
some
spicy
asian
food
or
in
my
case
a
bowl
full
of
wasabi
peas
a
very
forgettable
beer
in
a
sea
of
amazing
ones
drank
all
six
like
a
lush
in
one
night
could
have
drank
even
more
super
light
and
goes
down
very
smooth
and
easy
this
beer
is
a
clear
straw
color
with
columns
of
bubbles
and
a
shortlived
thin
white
head
very
little
lacing
is
present
sweetish
malt
and
light
hops
aroma
lightbodied
and
somewhat
crisp
with
a
fairly
bland
hops
and
malt
flavor
the
finish
is
short
and
lightly
bitter
indistinguishable
from
similar
beers
the
world
over
served
in
a
shaker
pint
d
this
is
a
below
average
beer
it
is
fairly
bland
and
doesnt
bring
much
in
terms
of
flavor
if
you
like
macros
give
this
a
try
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
a
light
macro
lager
slightly
better
than
bmc
im
scoring
this
as
average
since
it
is
just
an
average
macro
lager
not
worse
than
anything
available
here
but
not
any
better
this
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
a
bubbly
head
that
wasnt
very
impressive
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
but
hot
a
lot
of
smell
to
it
the
taste
was
unimpressive
it
has
an
american
lager
quality
with
nothing
too
exciting
to
say
it
is
a
crisp
beer
and
goes
down
smooth
and
refreshing
in
all
this
is
a
clean
refreshing
beer
i
would
rather
drink
it
after
a
hard
day
then
water
but
i
wouldnt
grab
it
out
of
my
refrigerator
over
most
other
beers
thanks
to
pegasus
for
the
karma
point
cheers
i
tried
this
beer
on
july
6
2007
after
purchasing
it
from
my
local
lcbo
store
it
poured
a
golden
orange
colour
into
the
glass
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
leaving
almost
no
foam
on
the
top
lots
of
effervescence
the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
malts
and
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
dances
on
the
tongue
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
some
malty
tones
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
a
touch
above
the
average
generic
lager
fairly
ok
on
tap
it
needs
to
develop
some
form
of
immunity
i
guess
this
is
basically
just
a
beer
to
have
with
food
works
fine
with
vietnamese
and
other
south
asian
foods
though
there
are
other
beers
i
would
prefer
not
recommended
for
having
on
its
own
d
this
might
be
a
good
beer
to
was
down
some
food
but
it
is
not
a
good
stand
alone
beer
dont
drink
and
review
well
it
appears
asia
has
mastered
a
tasteless
macro
american
lager
style
beer
it
has
gotten
more
rave
than
it
is
worth
but
i
would
prefer
it
over
an
american
because
it
has
a
little
bit
of
flavor
it
smells
yeasty
with
no
hops
at
all
yet
i
detect
a
slight
bit
of
flavoring
hops
and
some
bittering
hops
to
balance
it
out
well
not
a
bad
lawnmower
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
i
paid
about
8
bucks
a
six
pack
very
clean
beer
i
would
like
to
try
the
local
version
since
the
bottle
says
brewed
for
export
im
not
sure
if
they
add
more
hops
to
make
it
last
longer
like
they
did
with
the
ipa
or
not
but
i
expect
not
based
on
how
it
tastes
tiger
lager
beer
was
a
pale
golden
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
was
quickly
became
a
very
thin
layer
with
no
lace
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
grainy
the
taste
was
a
little
sweet
upfront
light
grain
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
clean
dry
finish
it
was
fairly
light
bodied
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
its
pretty
much
just
an
average
macro
lager
at
the
end
a
bit
heavy
i
poured
this
nice
beer
into
a
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
very
pale
beer
with
a
big
wite
foamy
head
that
did
not
hang
around
long
the
beer
had
a
bready
yeasty
nose
to
it
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
clean
and
crisp
not
much
really
exciting
but
just
a
good
summer
thirst
quenching
beer
i
will
buy
again
drinkability
hurts
would
not
recommend
unless
you
could
absolutely
find
nothing
else
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
it
american
macrobrews
except
their
tv
spots
which
are
amazing
it
seems
that
the
distributors
in
the
central
kentucky
area
are
pushing
this
beer
quite
hard
i
finally
ordered
one
under
the
pressure
gladly
it
didnt
seem
to
be
a
mistake
i
thought
the
beer
was
as
clean
tasting
as
it
looked
the
brightly
colored
straw
brew
with
a
bleached
head
retention
prevailed
with
a
solid
pilsner
malt
sweetness
and
low
levels
of
vegial
grain
flavors
spiced
with
hip
bittering
a
light
grassy
flavors
mostly
clean
in
the
feel
with
a
mild
grain
lingering
overall
decent
but
my
money
will
be
better
served
on
other
good
germal
lagers
d
not
a
terrible
rendition
of
a
macro
lager
but
nothing
outstanding
either
something
just
isnt
right
about
this
beer
theres
using
some
sort
of
weird
adjunct
id
rather
not
have
anything
to
do
with
i
dont
think
im
coming
back
to
this
one
i
guess
this
works
great
as
a
premium
lawnmower
beer
but
it
doesnt
go
well
with
my
cheese
plate
notes
for
the
price
this
is
a
solid
deal
was
perfect
for
an
after
work
chill
out
brew
on
a
hot
winter
day
78
notes
loads
of
this
stuff
wound
up
in

motorcity
when
the
tigers
were
hot
last
season
if
they
knew
how
bad
this
beer
sucked
theyd
probably
change
their
name
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
from
this
to
begin
with
but
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
perhaps
when
it
gets
hot
out
again
ill
get
some
more
of
this
or
maybe
order
it
with
food
at
the
thai
place
down
the
road
either
way
its
about
an
average
asian
copy
of
the
yellowfizzy
macrolager
this
is
not
my
usual
type
of
beer
however
it
did
prove
to
be
very
drinkable
with
a
curry
there
is
a
bit
of
sweet
aftertaste
but
it
is
clean
thus
bringing
me
to
the
conclusion
that
this
beer
can
be
a
session
beer
if
the
taste
were
better
drinks
pretty
easy
nothing
too
complex
here
but
rate
this
upperechelon
a
far
as
this
style
goes
whats
weird
is
this
tastes
better
than
it
did
in
thailand
just
next
door
where
it
displayed
more
earthy
hops
profilewise
this
is
probably
the
best
imported
beer
ive
had
from
mainland
asia
though
that
is
not
really
saying
much
this
is
basically
a
typical
macro
lager
with
one
slight
exception
sweetness
the
lager
hits
instantly
with
a
slight
sugary
taste
that
kind
of
distract
away
from
the
bland
taste
of
the
beer
itself
its
likely
some
adjuunct
that
gives
it
this
taste
tiger
works
well
in
relief
from
spicy
asian
cuisine
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
but
not
much
more
this
beer
has
clearly
been
made
as
bland
as
possible
for
mass
distribution
i
bought
it
under
the
auspice
that
it
was
actually
a
good
beer
from
singapore
upon
pouring
it
looked
almost
identical
and
smelled
identical
to
miller
lite
the
taste
was
not
there
at
all
it
just
ran
through
my
mouth
like
smooth
flavored
water
i
expected
way
more
but
ended
up
being
overcharged
on
a
macrobrew
import
nice
average
lager
overall
but
nothing
that
stands
out
in
my
mind
not
great
but
considering
it
is
almost
a
year
past
its
prime
it
wasnt
horrible
id
like
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
fresher
sample
and
try
again
this
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
big
head

well
carbonate
the
smell
is
very
generic
beer
like
the
taste
is
crisp
and
mellow
but
not
exciting
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
pronounced
carbonation
bite
id
consider
this
an
average
drinking
beer
suited
to
be
served
extremely
cold
on
hot
days
another
beer
that
to
me
did
not
spark
my
taste
buds
tasted
a
lot
like
a
lot
of
other
beers
i
have
tried
i
gave
it
a
chance
i
have
tried
beers
from
japan
that
i
thought
were
very
good
but
singapore
didnt
get
it
right
with
this
one
i
hope
this
is
not
their
only
beer
a
drink
for
hot
sunny
days
not
much
call
for
it
in
great
britain
so
i
shall
not
be
looking
out
for
it
unless
we
have
a
heatwave
or
global
warming
starts
to
mess
with
my
town
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
smells
like
grain
and
corn
it
tastes
like
sweet
grains
and
malt
with
a
small
bitter
aftertaste
the
taste
is
nonoffensive
but
its
not
great
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
with
that
being
said
it
does
go
down
pretty
smooth
and
is
easy
to
drink
for
a
macro
lager
its
not
too
bad
at
all
like
the
ba
score
for
this
beer
says
its
worth
a
try
this
brew
pours
a
clear
goldenstraw
color
a
little
darker
than
most
other
macro
lagers
the
head
is
a
solid
one
finger
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
there
might
be
some
mild
sweetness
but
it
is
hard
to
detect
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
very
weak
the
mouthfeel
however
is
actually
quite
nice
for
the
style
it
is
light
bodied
but
there
is
still
a
bit
more
to
it
than
your
average
bmc
overall
this
isnt
the
worst
macro
lager
i
have
ever
had
but
i
still
would
not
buy
it
again
may
be
best
with
a
mouthfull
of
pepper
seafood
dont
drink
it
on
its
own
overall
a
disappointing
beer
with
a
cool
beer
cap
fun
origami
beer
holder
and
perfect
to
down
while
watching
the
ds
tigues
i
do
enjoy
many
asian
beers
but
tiger
did
not
impress
me
it
had
a
flat
overly
grassy
taste
that
hardly
quenched
my
thirst
it
was
not
complex
what
so
ever
and
didnt
really
pair
well
with
the
food
that
was
recommended
with
it
if
picking
an
asian
beer
go
with
kirin
ichiban
before
this
one
an
asian
american
macro
lager
hmm
interesting
pours
a
champagne
bubbly
gold
with
a
three
finger
head
that
quickly
disipates
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
cheap
grain
smell
nothing
that
really
catches
the
nose
reminds
me
a
bit
of
cheerios
tastes
light
in
malts
finishing
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bitterness
grassy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
and
crisp
drinkable
in
the
same
way
soft
drinks
are
drinkable
probably
what
singapore
deserves
pours
a
light
golden
lots
of
bubbles
not
much
head
and
just
a
bit
of
lace
smell
is
of
weak
malts
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
is
malty
up
frontwith
some
hops
in
the
finish
refreshing
not
great
tasting
but
not
offensive
could
be
a
headach
waiting
to
happen
if
you
have
too
many
however
back
in
europe
i
find
this
brew
rather
bland
and
quite
forgetable
the
taste
is
the
same
quite
malty
for
a
lager
and
mediumlight
in
body
but
the
climate
is
different
how
to
review
it
then
the
first
time
i
ever
had
a
tiger
beer
was
on
an
overnight
train
from
beijing
to
inner
mongolia
as
a
buddy
of
mine
once
said
drinking
tiger
is
all
in
the
state
of
mind
it
means
youre
on
the
prowl
for
me
imported
microswill
gets
no
better
than
cold
tiger
beer
bought
one
bottle
as
part
of
a
make
your
own
sixer
mainly
bought
it
for
the
cap
clear
yellow
no
head
ethanol
malt
odor
corn
bananay
flavor
improves
slightly
as
it
warms
almost
tastes
belgian
which
is
weird
and
unexpected
but
its
still
not
a
good
taste
easy
drinkin
overall
a
very
forgetful
beer
nothing
sticks
out
that
makes
it
good
but
nothing
is
horrible
pours
thin
and
yellow
amber
with
a
wispy
white
head
aroma
is
malt
liquorish
just
some
metallic
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
funky
hops
sweet
malts
start
off
the
palate
lots
of
corn
and
rice
flavors
characteristics
not
terrible
just
very
very
boring
it
was
quite
smooth
refreshing
a
decent
alternative
to
most
american
macros
while
nothing
particularly
great
its
a
decent
choice
for
a
hot
day
it
had
a
bit
of
body
and
a
taste
that
is
absent
in
most
american
macros
for
the
style
its
not
bad
at
all
tiger
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
eleven
point
two
ounce
bottle
i
smell
a
little
malt
and
thats
about
it
malt
and
grain
adjunct
flavors
really
nothing
special
nothing
too
offensive
either
i
wont
likely
buy
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
fairly
average
this
one
isnt
terrible
would
go
well
with
some
good
asian
food
im
still
looking
for
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
south
asian
food
i
guess
if
you
drink
it
cold
enough
on
a
hot
enough
day
its
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
average
and
unimpressive
first
sip
isnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
not
as
cheap
tasting
as
a
lot
of
asian
lagers
tend
to
be
there
is
a
slight
lemony
tartness
that
tends
to
hit
the
tongue
as
it
warms
and
a
faint
roasted
character
alcohol
is
present
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
bites
the
tongue
well
this
would
pair
very
well
with
asian
food
and
is
one
of
the
better
asian
lagers
ive
tried
its
still
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
though
not
bad
really
it
would
never
beat
something
like
sam
smiths
organic
lager
or
rogues
uber
pils
but
its
a
good
lawnmower
beer
thats
better
than
the
macros
the
mouth
was
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
the
very
active
carbonation
helped
while
not
offensive
this
beer
does
not
have
much
to
recommend
it
it
did
go
fairly
well
with
the
sushi
but
was
bit
overwhelmed
by
the
spicier
rolls
pale
golden
color
with
a
larger
but
thin
bright
white
head
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
ring
of
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
malty
with
a
cereal
adjunct
note
being
dominant
theres
also
an
herbal
edge
in
there
which
seems
to
cut
the
aroma
short
its
all
a
bit
weak
really
taste
isnt
quite
as
weak
but
still
fairly
flavorless
once
again
the
sweeter
malts
come
out
and
they
are
definitely
adjunct
derived
tastes
cereal
like
to
me
a
bit
of
grassyness
is
there
and
dries
out
in
the
finish
which
is
quite
crisp
and
thirst
quenching
really
for
that
the
beer
accomplishes
what
i
wanted
it
to
and
the
mouthfeel
gets
some
good
points
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
average
at
best
i
actually
much
to
my
surprise
found
this
quite
nice
and
easilly
drinkable
on
the
can
it
says
to
serve
this
cold
46c4043f
and
i
might
not
have
this
as
cold
as
that
i
would
guess
that
if
you
drank
it
that
cold
that
alot
of
the
flavours
and
aromas
would
die
down
perhaps
and
hopefully
the
chemical
dry
finish
and
actually
make
this
beer
taste
a
bit
better
but
it
probably
wouldnt
smell
as
good
not
a
terrific
beer
but
average
to
better
than
average
for
a
macro
lager
its
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
and
better
than
many
asian
lagers
ive
tried
overall
this
beer
is
okay
kind
of
watered
down
but
not
bad
in
its
own
way
good
for
washing
down
spicy
foods
refreshing
enough
with
the
meal
im
glad
the
unagi
was
good
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
i
was
happy
to
get
to
try
this
out
at
wolfgang
pucks
in
lake
buena
vista
fl
i
love
the
bottlecap
that
i
managed
to
remove
without
so
much
as
a
scratch
or
dent
its
the
same
tiger
under
a
palm
tree
that
is
seen
on
the
main
label
and
the
neck
label
thats
pretty
much
it
for
the
high
points
having
said
that
one
could
do
much
worse
the
fact
that
i
could
down
34
cold
bottles
of
tiger
beer
with
a
minimal
amount
of
complaining
should
count
for
something
dont
reccommend
it
if
you
are
not
on
holiday
in
asia
not
a
pleasant
experience

cant
believe
this
brew
is
still
in
production
clear
lemon
yellow
pour
quick
vanishing
white
head
aroma
of
veggies
and
some
euro
skunk
musty
quaff
maybe
some
hints
of
bread

an
earthy
finish
that
left
me
wanting
a
water
to
help
wash
out
the
taste
was
a
free
gift
drank
the
whole
500ml
of
course
overall
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
big
macro
companies
give
this
one
a
try
its
a
definitely
improvement
although
not
much
of
one
id
never
go
back
to
it
unless
it
was
the
only
brand
of
beer
available
in
the
county
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
nice
retention
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
light
and
dry
pale
malt
scent
that
is
a
bit
husky
and
devoid
of
any
real
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
below
average
it
has
absolutely
no
malt
character
at
all
along
with
no
hop
flavor
or
finish
it
tastes
like
the
second
runnings
of
a
light
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
not
a
very
good
beer
i
guess
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
or
with
spicey
food
but
otherwise
its
one
and
done
for
me
a
half
decent
lager
an
easy
pick
when
you
want
a
weak
flavored
beer
to
wash
down
extra
spicy
panasian
cuisine
this
beer
pours
a
nice
straw
color
with
a
white
fluffy
head
looks
very
good
theres
very
little
aroma
but
what
is
there
is
a
little
yeasty
a
little
hoppy
not
too
bad
tastemouthfeel
is
very
nice
its
very
creamy
a
little
yeasty
pretty
sweet
with
a
clean
finish
all
around
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
this
one
heck
i
even
like
some
macro
swill
more
than
this
one
tiger
pours
a
crystalclear
strawgold
body
beneath
a
bright
white
head
that
holds
very
well
but
leaves
no
lace
the
nose
is
basic
but
there
are
some
floral
grassy
and
spicy
hops
present
its
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
standard
carbonation
and
lightmedium
body
the
flavor
delivers
a
wellbalanced
combination
of
sweetish
adjunctladen
malt
a
solid
bitterness
and
spicy
hops
that
linger
shortly
in
the
dry
aftertaste
a
basic
but
nicely
hopped
golden
lager
the
smell
is
faint
but
at
least
its
not
turning
me
away
the
taste
is
of
bland
malts
with
a
moderate
pepper
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
it
isnt
very
appealing
but
there
are
worse
aroma
was
nonexistant
the
flavor
was
of
mild
malt
grass
and
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
very
bland
and
boring
for
the
tastebuds
smooth
and
lightly
crisp
at
the
start
with
a
clean
finish
drinkability
is
very
average
due
to
bland
flavor
but
for
the
upcoming
spicey
food
ill
be
eating
i
wont
be
able
to
taste
it
anyway
from
tap
poured
very
light
gold
with
about
a
finger
of
artificial
looking
head
which
disappeared
pretty
quick
aroma
what
aroma
my
senses
could
have
been
a
little
attenuated
as
i
was
following
the
abc
extra
stout
but
all
i
could
detect
was
a
faint
hint
of
vomit
taste
what
taste
best
that
can
be
said
is
that
it
was
not
offensive
someone
has
obviously
beaten
this
tiger
with
a
very
large
stick
and
turned
it
into
a
pussy
cat
palate
was
watery
and
weak
the
one
redeeming
factor
is
that
it
goes
down
very
easily
in
the
tropical
heat
this
is
nothing
like
the
beer
i
remember
15
years
ago
since
the
can
is
old
i
can
say
for
sure
how
much
it
changed
its
caracteristics
according
to
me
it
seems
to
be
another
average
macro
also
the
others
reviews
leads
me
to
believe
this
is
another
instable
brand
it
seems
to
lack
some
standards
sometime
i
would
be
ok
sometime
not
thats
about
it
bottled
pour
reveals
a
standard
pale
gold
clear
mega
lager
with
a
bubbly
white
cap
minimal
retention
and
lacing
fizzy
reasonable
aroma
some
garins
and
grassy
hops
over
a
light
fruit
tone
light
bosy
easily
drinkable
fair
balance
between
sweet
malts
and
hops
dry
clean
finish
this
is
a
premium
mega
lager
taste
pours
a
dark
gold
color
the
smell
is
pleasant
like
many
fruits
with
a
refreshing
undertone
the
initial
taste
is
like
a
white
wine
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
fruits
although
its
not
till
the
beer
is
swallowed
that
you
get
the
true
flavor
it
seems
to
coat
your
throat
with
the
same
winey
acidic
taste
that
lingers
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
until
you
take
another
sip
the
otherwise
blandness
in
the
flavor
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
made
for
spicy
asian
food
when
you
would
want
to
have
something
that
quells
the
heat
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
the
main
flaw
being
its
bland
appearance
it
was
great
with
my
chinese
food
from
the
mandarin

probably
the
corn
i

tasting
not
much
here
at
all
and
not
very
pleasant
thin

not
that
drinkable
will
take
the
sting
out
of

there
i
said
something
nice
a
clean
light
yellow
beer
with
a
small
white
heat
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
witha
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
has
a
light
hint
of
sweetness
over
the
tongue
with
an
even
lighter
dry
hop
finish
i
guess
this
might
be
refreshing
in
the
sweltering
heat
but
so
would
a

no

you

with

that
quickly

very
little

thin
watery
taste
ever
so
slight
hopiness
after
a
while
carbonation
pretty
much
gone
and
taste
fades
to
nothingness
no
aftertaste
at
all
good
or
bad
on
its
own
a
bland
brew
but
would
probably
be
a
very
nice
compliment
to
a
spicy
asian
meal
will
try
with
food
next
time
reflection
why
import

when
there
are

minimal

and
zero

almost

the

is

very
prickly
standard
basic
normal

theres
nothing
offensive
here
except
for
the
fact
that
i
know
beer
can
taste
so
much
better
theres
some
malt
in
the
opening
bland
and
watery
there
is
no
hops
followup
leaving
a
musty
wet

kind
of
aftertaste
lord
knows
i
drank
enough
of
this
kind
of
stuff
before
sam
adams
changed
my
world
no
need
to
go
back
to
this
now
the

claims
a
distinctive

that
is
winning
the

seemed

i
dug

into

alsobut
really
almost
nothing
detectable
taste
is
similarly
light
and
sweet
and
not
so
interesting
a
smooth
creamy
rush
of
soft
bubbles
through
the
mouth
makes
this
beer
drinkable
and
mildly
unique
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
though
no
reason
to
drink
this
one
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
quick
to
fade
white
burst
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
too
faint
for
me
to
really
care
to
bother
describing
it
the
flavor
has
a
little
bit
of
malt
to
it
but
more
of
this
vegetalcorn
thing
that
was
really
giving
me
a
bit
of
trouble
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
youve
got
to
keep
this
one
ice
cold
or
its
nearly
undrinkable
incredibly
light
lager
not
a
head
to
be
seen
but
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
skunky
as
all
hell
in
the
aroma
department
i
also
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
the
taste
i
dont
recomend
this
to
anyone
i
would
give
this
to
someone
i
dont
like
that
much
not
bad
if
your
looking
for
a
simple
workhorse
lager
but
still
nothin
special
overall
a
watery
cheap
beer
that
you
should
not
waste
your
money
on
although
the
bottle
cap
is
kinda
cool
appearance
golden
and
fizzy
thats
about
it
thin
short
lived
head
just
poor
looking
brew
aroma
wretchedness
as
my
lovely
girlfriend
carrie
put
it
so
eloquently
smells
worse
than
old
e
grainy
malt
liquor
like
approach
no
hopes
bland
blah
taste
tolerable
only
because
of
its
lack
of
flavor
there
is
also
a
distinct
offness
ridden
with
rice
as
its
evil
adjunct
of
choice
mouthfeel
thin
bodied
watery
who
cares
about
carbonation
drinkability
wow
i
cant
believe
they
export
this
shit
who
else
in
the
world
would
send
this
shitty
beer
ill
tell
you
the
same
one
that
beats
their
citizens
with
rods
nothing
spectacular
but
tigers
still
a
nice
if
a
little
expensive
quaffer
great
when
its
hot
and
alongside
stir
fry
noodles
or
curries
worth
a
go
every
so
often
the
color
of
this
beer
is
light
clear
gold
with
an
undistinguished
head
there
is
some
grainy
aroma
the
light
grainy
taste
has
a
little
hop
bite
to
it
it
does
have
good
carbonation
although
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
and
dry
there
is
not
too
much
going
on
here
this
beer
doesnt
taste
or
smell
awful
and
probably
is
a
thirstquenching
hot
climate
beer
but
i
didnt
care
too
much
for
it
the
best
things
about
it
were
the
label
and
the
bottle
cap
nothing
remarkable
happening
here
if
i
were
blindfolded
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
differentiate
singapores
tiger
beer
from
japanese
and
korean
beers
overall
this
rates
as
probably
my
favorite
asian
beer
easily
beating
out
others
like
singha
and
san
miguel
this
brew
has
a
fuller
more
rounded
and
balanced
profile
than
most
asian
lagers
it
also
brings
back
some
pretty
fine
memories
of
good
times
in
singapore
slighty
malty
aroma
with
maybe
a
hint
of
corn
or
some
other
adjunctnot
exactly
sure
though
somewhat
thin
watery
mouthfeel
followed
by
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
and
some
co2
to
balance
off
the
malt
make
this
a
very
refreshing
lager
as
an
import
it
costs
a
lot
more
than
the
average
local
stuff
pass
drinkability
ranks
right
up
there
with
most
domestic
macro
lagers
bland
pretty
boring
and
straightforward
thank
goodness
this
was
a
gift
give
me
an
asahi
over
it
though
light

medium
white
foamy

is
grainy
and
swet
a
light

style
beer
light

hoppy
mild

mouthfeel
is
full
and

finish
is

and

aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
fairly
standard
lager
my
advice
for
what
its
worth
keep
a
few
in
the
beer
frig
for
your
friends
who
are
still
exploring
the
world
of
beer
and
for
yourself
for
a
good
breakfast
beer
flavor
is
light
yet
fairly
rich
and
mildly
hoppy
a
little
plain
and
bland
the
hops
are
actually
very
nice
providing
a
spicy
finish
the
malting
isnt
perfect
kind
of
muddy
with
a
light
corny
taste
not
super
crisp
but
the
finish
is
very
good
reminds
me
of
heineken
or
becks
well
carbonated
light
body
a
decent
pilsener
or
american
style
lager
but
plain
it
beats
bud
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
theres
a
dry
aftertaste
that
leaves
a
clean
feeling
in
the
mouth
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
thin
lace
nose
is
sweet
malt
and
bitter
grain
husks
light
to
medium
in
body
and
quite
crisp
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
some
grassy
notes
followed
by
some
spicy
alcohol
this
is
a
good
quencher
and
would
make
a
great
lawn

i
can
taste
no
adjuncts
so
i
imagine
the
malt
content
to
be
high
marvelous
extralight
beer
if
that
is
not
a
contradiction
in
terms
this
was
a
great
beer
for
the
tpo
my
favorite
beer
from
asia
its
lost
its
charm
over
the
years
but
i
still
come
back
to
it
from
time
to
time
especially
when
eating
out
thai
or
vietnamese
food
this
one
came
in
a
big
640ml
brown
bottle
with
gold
foil
around
the
neck
and
cap
a
clear
golden
colour
it
pours
out
with
a
sizable
white
head
which
sinks
to
about
a
dimes
width
after
a
short
while
cant
pick
up
any
discernable
nose
at
all
but
the
taste
is
sweet
and
light
and
not
as
dry
as
one
would
initially
expect
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
great
partnered
up
with
spicy
asian
food
or
just
really
hot
weather
the
taste
was
excellent
full
bodied
with
a
hint
of
spice
tiger
has
a
nice
malt
sweet
nice
that
balances
the
spice
and
a
very
smooth
even
finish
i
would
rank
this
by
far
the
best
pacificrim
beer
and
put
it
against
any
lager
around
the
world
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
the
right
dish
maybe
a
pasta
or
a
salad
compared
to
say
heineken
this
is
better
its
not
a
spectaculr
beer
but
for
its
style
it
is
very
good
and
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
gold
color
with
a
head
that
barely
there
the
color
white
and
the
texture
frothy
with
some
scraps
of
lace
nose
is
all
malt
sweet
as
is
the
start
the
malt
profile
sparing
and
the
top
cadaverous
in
feel
finish
is
spitefully
acidic
with
the
hops
meek
and
mild
to
the
palate
quite
dry
aftertaste
and
it
truly
does
live
up
to
its
name
of
tiger
piss
but
it
was
better
than
the
american
macros
we
received
in
viet
nam
laced
with
formaldehyde
had
this
at
a
thai
restaurant
in
my
neighbourhood
posters
on
the
wall
proclaiming
its
gold
medal
at
the
brewing
industry
awards
or
some
such
in
london
99
im
not
really
all
that
impressed
virtually
no
head
undistinguished
aroma
and
flavour
its
not
bad
but
its
barely
better
than
a
labatt
or
molson
if
at
all
good
thing
i
didnt
go
for
the
thai
beer
though
singha
turns
out
to
be
a
malt
liquor
i
found
this
tiger
lager
a
disappointment
very
little
head
and
what
there
was
quickly
disapaited
there
is
no
sparkle
to
this
product
and
certainly
no
fizz
nice
colour
full
bodied
but
flat
as
if
it
had
been
poured
the
night
before
how
sad
an
average
beer
medium
straw
in
color
with
slight
head
and
no
lace
slightly
sweet
cooked
veggie
taste
with
slight
hop
aftertaste
goes
down
smoothly
but
lacks
more
character
a
little
too
fizzy
quite
a
light
lager
but
mananges
to
maintain
an
ok
rounded
flavour
good
when
the
weathre
shot
gos
down
smooth
a
super
light
pilsener
beer
bland
and
inocuous
yellow
and
fizzy
no
real
flavor
to
speak
of
other
than
some
rice
adjuncts
popular
in
asia
as
many
similar
beers
are
this
one
is
about
the
lightest
one
ive
tried
on
this
trip
to
china
skip
over
this
one
and
try
something
else
my
favorite
beer
to
drink
with
some
mariscos
on
a
hot
day
bumping
some
corridos
con
mi
gente
ahuevosaludos
o
well
its
at
least
as
good
as
corona
and
better
than
some
light
beers
blah
not
overtly
offensive
i
can
see
certain
climate
and
cuisine
situations
where
this
would
um
work
but
not
really
enjoyable
in
the
least
when
held
up
on
its
own
cheap
plain
and
boring
beyond
the
cutesy
squat
bottle
but
we
all
knew
that
coming
in
i
like
it
if
i
have
to
drink
a
beer
of
this
nature
this
is
my
favorite
beer
to
drink
while
floating
the
river
in
95
degree
heat
tastes
great
with
limebeer
salt
and
isnt
much
more
expensive
than
the
traditional
american
macro
lagers
in
texas
great
session
beer
if
youre
sweating
had
bottle
with
dinner
hit
the
spot
with
burritos
very
drinkable
lager
good
with
dinner
or
a
hot
day
served
in
a
mug

this

good
beer
for

drink
it
often

i
need
to
quench
my
thirst
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
definitely
my
go
to
beer
when
i
need
one
best
mexican
beer
out
there
its
a

mexican
beer
dosxx
is
prolly
my
favorite
mexican
beer
as
of
22315
nice
mexican
lager
that
avoids
skunkiness
being
in
a
can
not
bad
this
beer
is
really
good
i
got
this
at
my
local
tex
mex
joint
as
a
change
of
pace
i
guess
what
i
got
of
course
was
a
fairly
mediocre
slightly
below
average
adjunct
lager
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
its
not
good
either
it
ranks
with
corona
this
is
a
true
barley
pop
true
to

overall
this
is

its

you

boom
felt

pbr
not

a

more

drinkable
than
most
aals
can
poured
into

somewhere
in

actually
in

san

whatever
a
dark
than
expected
orangeyellow
with
a
light
dappling
of
white
bubbles
rimming
the
glass
aroma
is
slightly
astringent
and
grainy
with
an
overarching
corn
sweetness
i
was
actually
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
taste
perhaps
because
the
expectancy
bar
was
set
appropriately
low
there
is
a
subtle
buttery
raisin
note
in
there
along
with
a
watermelon
rindlike
element
noble
hops
whoa
almost
like
a
drastically
watereddown
oktoberfest
and
distinct
from
other
mexican
mainstream
adjunct
lagers
in
this
regard
the
expected
corn
sweetness
is
of
course
still
present
obviously
its
thin
and
watery
but
there
are
at
least
some
other
low
key
flavors
to
note
here
perhaps
i
am
guilty
of
overstating
the
case
at
least
this
is
almost
as
available
as
corona
and
pacifico

these
parts

a
fingernail

and
a

in

middle
some
light

in
the
glass
i
smell
corn
and
perhaps
some
german
bittering
hops
the
taste
is
corn
and
well
water
like
lager
yeast
the

also

but
thats
about
all
it
has
going
for
it
smell
and
flavor
are
typical
for
an
aal
with
adjuncts
dominating
the
carbonation
is
weak
and
it
flattens
quickly
only
got
it
at
a
texmex
restaurant
because
it
was
a
happy
hour
special
there
are
far
better
choices
in
mexican
beers
for
what
it
is
its
great
this
really
isnt
bad
ive
liked
negra
modelo
since
i
started
drinking
beer
but
never
had
modelo
especial
until
recently
very
big
on
the
malt
flavor
and
very
mexican
in
taste
in
that
it
tastes
like
many
other
mexican
brews
a
friend
handed
me
one
of
these
and
while
i
probably
wouldnt
pay
for
a
six
pack
myself
id
definitely
have
this
one
again
this
was
my
drink
of
choice
while
in
mexico
had
a
nice
flavor
and
not
just
water
now
and
again
i
will
pick
up
a
6
pack
modelo
especial
has
a
smooth
flavour
of
beer
with
medium
hops
no
bitterness
within
modelo
especial
medium
foam
is
a
characteristic
of
modelo
especial
carbonation
disappears
quickly
within
modelo
especial
i
am
the
person
who
posted
the
photo
of
modelo
especial
overall
3
12
again
this
beer
is
leagues
better
than
corona
extra
i
dont
even
want
to
look
at
a
corona
again
modelo
especial
is
still
pretty
terrible
but
drinkable
if
someone
showed
up
to
a
party
with
modelo
or
if
it
was
in
a
cooler
full
of
macro
light
lagers
id
take
this
in
a
second
if
there
were
anything
else
that
was
in
the
running
however
i
would
leave
it
chilling
in
the
icebox
i
hope
that
makes
sense
ill
pass
on
this
brew
next
time
well
what
can
i
say
some
drunk
left
behind
a
can
of
this
so
i
put
it
my
fridge
until
the
moment
when
it
was
all
i
had
i
really
hadnt
tasted
beer
like
this
for
a
long
long
time
back
in
the
day
you
could
buy
a
six
pack
of
red
white
and
blue
for
maybe
two
bucks
or
some
dive
might
have
pitcher
night
or
something
if
you
were
to
overhear
a
party
discussing
this
beer
and
one
said
taste
like
piss
his
mate
would
probably
just
retort
how
would
you
know

plan
on
buying
myself
a
pack
on
occassion
it
poured
a
head
of
foam
that
vanished
fairly
quickly
on

of
the
lightly
colored
liquid
i
have
never
really
enjoyed
a
corona
which
made
me
skeptical
of
this
taste
as
far
as
adjunct
lagers
go
you
could
do
a

worse
not
doing
a
whole
lot
for
me
prickly
and
abrasive
on
the
tongue
i
suppose
this
drinks
quickly
but
the
flavor
isnt
great
for
an
adjunct
id
take
a
pabst
or
bud
over
this
any

added
a

at

pleasantly
surprised
the

prevents
skunking
from

with
a

traditional
right
whats
to
say
about
the
look
its
light
golden
smell
is
citrusy
on

at

the
only
place
i
drink
it
and
the
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
with
the
lime
smooth
medium
bodied
with
a
pleasant
taste
overall
best
for
a
hot
day
at
the

this
is
overpriced
crap
the
only
way
i
can
enjoy
one
of
these
is
when
its
ice
cold
and
with
a
lime
wedge
which
covers
up
the
bad
flavor
tastes
like
urine
when
served
normally
this
has
no
business
being
as
expensive
as
it

id
rather

i
could
many
of

complete

if

youre

someone
is
giving
this

go
for
it
if
it
is
any
other
scenario
why
are
you
drinking
it
you
know
on
a
nice
summer
day
outside
on
the

i
just
like
to
have
a

faint

good
freshness
the
sugar
is
good

does
not
feel
artificial

no

enjoy

you

your

gets

by
the
as

taste
utterly
devoid

yuck
there
is
a
place
and
time
for
these
coronas
look
great
but
they
have
a
horrible

and
horrible
taste
definitely
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
awful
need
i
say
more
looks
ill
tastes
watery
inconsistent
carbonation
even
fruiting
the
beer
doesnt

looks

its

fucking
close

not

but
not
a

either
smells
horrible
but
taste
fine
a
mexican
version
of
budweiser
and
about
the
same
taste
wise
o
beer
for
the
general
public
not
for

lovers
its
good
for

not
great
but
better

city

thank

this
would

did
someone
piss
in
a
bottle
and
mark
it
beer
has
a
nice
solid
straight
up
look
smells
refreshing
to
most
the
taste
is
going
to
be
an
acquired
taste
aka
youll
get
used
to
it
if
you
have
to
add
something
to
mask
the
bad
taste
then
it
sucks
that
being
said
ice
cold
with
a
wedge
of
fresh
lime
this
is
hard
to
beat
on
a
hot
summer
day
take
the
lime
and
hot
summer
day
away
i
prefer
piss
warm
chango
o
avoid
this
beer
nice
mouthfeel
cant
make
up
for
everything
else
even
lime
cant
help
this
favorite
new
beer
to
sit
around
and
get
drunk
on
its
the
best
beer
ever
created
its
always
fresher
wen
u
get
one
from
mexico
in
t
j
mexico
refreshing
beer
with
very
little
taste
it
is
similar
to
american
lagers
nothing
special
not
a
great
beer
but
refreshing
during
the
summer
light
refreshing
decent
in
the
bottle
with
a
lime
tangy
taste
with
a
lime
in
summer
unusual
sweet
taste
even
when
i
was
a
youngster
and
didnt
know
any
better
i
still
never
pick
this
beer
the
only
reason
i
did
a
rating
is
to
have
a
accurate
list
of
beers
ive
had
i
get
sad
looking
at
the
bottle
lol
less
offensive
than
budweiser
coors
miller
or
bush
but
lets
put
it
this
way
if
corona
isnt
a
drunk
mexicans
piss
in
a
bottle
it
sure
as
hell
tastes
like
it
the
fact
that
people
only
seem
to
drink
this
beer
with
plenty
of
lime
or
lemon
juice
added
is
a
testament
to
how
undrinkable
this
beer
truly
is
not
bad
easy
to
drink
i
could
knock
a
couple
down
at
some
dive
very
light
and
tasty
i
like
mine
with
a
wedge
of
lime
and
a
healthy
pinch
of
salt
not
for
beer
snobs
but
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
its
good
for
summer
parties
and
with
lemon
i
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
a
girl
nekkid
i
was
glistening
with
joy
and
excited
about
the
fruits
i
was
about
to
partake
of
after
it
was
over
i
thought
to
myself
that
was
the
greatest
thing
ever
then
i
met
a
real
woman
and
saw
her
nekkid
and
she
blew
my
mind
and
i
totally
forgot
about
the
first
girl
well
corona
is
the
first
nekkid
chick
i
saw
forgettable
good
beer
that
you
can
find
anywhere
corona
is
my
go
to
for
a
good
mexican
beer
its
not
great
but
prefer
it
over
del
sol
acceptable
lawnmower
beer
if
thirsty
enough
and
need
to
operate
machinery
god
awful
regret
buying
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
a
beach
with
a
slice
of
lemon
or
lime
on
a
hot
day
a
cold
corona
is
a
beautiful
sight
with
that
golden
color
and
the
sweat
beads
collecting
on
the
bottle
its
not
heavy
its
not
a
designer
beer
its
not
an
ipa
but
its
got
a
great
taste
and
its
perfect
for
quenching
a
thirst
built
up
in
the
august
mexican
sun
corona
has
its
place
best
enjoyed
while
floating
around
on
something
inflatable
with
a
slice
of
lime
jammed
into
the
neck
sampling
this
beer
from
a
glass
was
strange
it
is
no
better
or
worse
that
your
usual
macros
suited
for
quenching
thirst
end
of
story
slightly
better
than
water
dont
see
the
attraction
light
beer
has
more
flavour
had
one
too
many
at
a
friends
birthday
party
otherwise
wouldnt
dream
of
purchasing
this
shite
an
okay
beer
but
way
overpriced
t
like
skunk
using
lime
and
serving
ice
cold
can
cover
some
of
this
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
this
beer
its
best
to
drink
on
a
beach
lime
needed
for
better
taste
hard
to
belive
that
i
used
to
like
this
it
is
real
beer
or
another
drink
so
i
am
not
afraid
to
say
that
i
truly
enjoy
a
corona
with
lime
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
that
said
i
tried
it
without
a
lime
and
it
was
really
tough
to
drink
skunky
murky
and
strange
i
will
continue
to
drink
it
in
the
summer
at
times
but
it
makes
me
wonder
what
the
lime
is
covering
up
i
would
give
it
a
3
25
overall
with
the
lime
but
i
am
trying
to
just
rate
the
beer
here
and
i
think
i
may
have
been
generous
reviewed
at
long
last
one
of
several
consumed
over
the
christmas
break
in
cabo
san
lucas
an
embarrassing
previous
staple
of
mine
and
the
sort
of
thing
you
want
to
kick
someone
for
daring
to
drink
here
yet
loaded
with
nostalgia
and
primed
via
years
of
social
conditioning
that
says
skunked
corn
actually
tastes
good
everyone
knows
the
color
but
for
posteritys
sake
its
bright
yellow
and
has
pretty
minimal
white
fizz
rimming
the
glass
smells
like
creamed
corn
seasoned
with
a
nondescript
applelike
fruitiness
due
to
underaging
with
a
dash
of
skunky
marsh
vegetation
true
to
form
i
do
find
this
to
be
the
corniest
of
the
mainstream
mexican
fizz
parade
with
corn
bread
and
dms
cooked
veggie
flavors
running
the
show
sweeter
and
breadier
than
pacifico
with
subtle
apple
and
citrus
notes
some
people
claim
they
can
taste
a
hint
of
lime
in
this
even
without
the
iconic
wedge
added
sure
although
its
probably
a
mirage
id
actually
say
the
carbonation
is
moderate
thin
watery
and
finishes
predictably
sweet
with
a
bare
hint
of
grass
the
corn
and
skunk
elements
do
add
some
character
than
is
missing
from
american
examples
of
the
style
but
see
my
above
remark
about
conditioning
dont
mistake
this
preference
for
good
beer
most
people
pay
little
attention
when
drinking
this
but
i
suggest
you
do
so
for
educational
purposes
if
nothing
else
skip
the
lime
too
at
least
once
refreshing
very
refreshing
like
water
330ml
clear
bottle
not
terrible
sweet
grain
corn
with
a
light
ugly
bitterness
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
unless
there
are
no
other
choices
a
decent
beer
for
a
restaurant
outing
not
spectacular
but
its
fine
enough
for
what
it
is
solid
lager
fare
a
little
better
than
similar
american
offerings
in
my
opinion
smells
like
cat
urine
tastes
wicked
awful
like
sex
in
a
canoe
on
a
river
near
a
water
treatment
plant
but
not
as
bad
as
bud
light
though
its
not
the
best
beer
its
comfort
food
for
us
left
coasters
simple
almost
a
light
beer
in
disguise
coronas
very
light
in
taste
mild
clean
with
no
bitterness
and
has
a
rather
thin
tasting
watery
feel
its
flavour
is
minimal
but
on
a
hot
day
it
quenches
the
thirst
i
cant
understand
how
people
drop
24

a
case
on
this
beer
and
then
proclaim
its
something
drastically
different
and
superior
to
the
traditional
american
adjunct
lagers
this
is
a
subpar
beer
overpriced
and
bland
and
would
be
commendable
for
its
sole
purpose
to
be
consumed
on
a
beach
with
a
citrus
wedge
if
it
wasnt
so
astronomically
expensive
modelo
while
by
no
means
great
is
much
more
flavorful
and
heavier
probably
why
its
not
as
big
of
a
sessionable
beer
although
its
sales
blow
corona
out
of
the
water
at
the
particular
liquor
store
i
work
at
most
refreshing
beer
when
its
not
skunked
coronas
very
light
in
taste
mild
clean
with
no
bitterness
and
has
a
rather
thin
tasting

feel
its

but
on
a
hot

it
quenches
the
thirst
i
see
this
is
rated
lowly
once
again
i
dont
really
know
what
you
all
are
comparing
this
to
it
doesnt
remotely
compare
to
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
or
any
of
that
compared
to
budweiser
and
others
in
its
class
its
a
step
up
this
beer
is
just
a
fancy
pabst
blue
ribbon
heavy
enunciation
on
the
quotation
marks
there
is
honestly
nothing
good
to
say
about
this
beer
its
complete
butt
buy
it
if
you
wanna
look
cool
at
your
high
school
party
otherwise
stay
away
nothing
to
see
here
keep
it
moving
i
created
an
account
and
gave
this
beer
a
5
simply
to
try
and
offest
all
the
terribly
negative
reviews
this
is
a
massproduced
pale
lager
its
not
going
to
be
anything
like
your
supahfancy
exquiste
craft
brews
alone
without
the
customary
lime
it
is
sorta
nasty
and
smells
skunky
and
it
looks
like
straight
up
piss
but
add
that
magical
slice
of
lime
make
sure
to
squeeze
out
all
the
juices
i
mean
really
lime
it
up
use
a
gigantic
slice
of
lime
and
bam
you
have
a
kickass
refreshing
beverage
sure
its
not
really
the
beer
we
are
reviewing
at
this
point
more
of
a
beerlime
shandy
type
thing
but
my
god
it
is
refreshing
and
delicious
tell
me
a
better
beer
to
put
a
lime
in
this
blows
bud
light
lime
out
of
the

it
is

than

anheuserbusch
will

if
theres
nothing

around
it
is
beer
in
the
most
technical
sense
probably
the
most
overrated
overhyped
and
overmarketed
beer
of
all
time
the
popularity
of
this
beer
proves
that
strategic
marketing
can
sell
millions
of
beers
not
the
taste
or
quality
of
the
product
the
brew
has
a
waterysour
grain
and
flat
taste
that
can
be
rather
repulsive
people
that
defend
this
beer
always
say
you
have
to
drink
it
with
lime
i
understand
where
they
are
coming
from
the
lime
masks
the
bland
taste
and
adds
some
flavour
lime
should
never
need
to
be
added
in
order
to
make
a
beer
tolerable
it
amazes
me
how
popular
corona
extra
is
and
how
they
try
to
position
it
as
a
premium
brew
this
is
proof
that
marketing
and
presenting
a
certain
image
with
beer
does
not
reflect
a
quality
product
i
certainly
agree
with
others
on
this
site
that
corona
is
not
good
beer
it
is
a
very
tepid
aal
and
not
much
more
can
be
said
about
it
the
color
is
a
light
yellow
a
couple
others
said
it
looks
like
urine
they
are
not
wrong
i
drink
it
at
my
local
tex
mex
joint
on
corona
thursdays
special
low
price
as
it
should
be
i
wedge
a
lime
in
the
neck
of
the
bottle
to
pretend
theres
something
flavorful
about
this
beer
but
there
really
isnt
aroma
is
not
rotten
vegetables
though
its
just
faint
corn
grains
nothing
special
no
head
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
weak
but
smooth
mouthfeel
is
acceptable
its
an
acceptable
mediocre
beer
you
can
drink
a
few
at
a
time
and
its
not
going
to
faze
you
get
it
on
special
and
wedge
that
lime
in
enough
said
second
worst
beer
on
the
planet
after
heineken
fact
it
is
what
it
is
if
you
need
to
add
an
actual
fruit
how
can
the
beer
be
good
overall
popular
with
the
18
to
20
somethings
at
university
this
beer
is
really
only
drinkable
with
half
a
lime
wedged
in
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
chilled
to
the
point
were
your
taste
buds
cant
tell
what
you
are
actually
drinking
this
is
my
safety
beer
if
i
know
i
have
a
night
of
drinking
ahead
of
me
ill
stick
with
corona
delicious
lime
water
g
g
g
g
g
is
this
beer
i
will
drink
this
if
someone
pays
for
it
in
the
summer
and
there
is
nothing
else
to
drink
i
think
its
quite
insulting
to
call
this
beer
to
be
honest
yes
its
refreshing
but
its
not
beer
its
a
soft
drink
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
somewhat
light
flavor
but
somewhat
refreshing
despite
this
for
what
it
is
its
quite
good
to
really
open
up
the
flavor
add
a
wedge
of
lime
i
find
corona
to
be
an
underrated
brew
its
not
the
best
but
it
certainly
isnt
awful
and
its
far
better
than
other
mass
produced
beers
enjoyable
around
summer
time
not
much
to
say
no
mas
i
gotta
give
this
piss
water
a
5
yes
it
taste
horrible
yes
it
probably
does
have
some
pee
in
it
but
this
beer
was
my
first
beer
ever
and
thats
special
to
me
its
gotten
me
hella
wasted
its
gotten
me
into
a
lot
of
fun
most
of
all
it
brings
great
memories
of
me
relaxing
on
a
beach
with
my
wife
this
is
the
vacation
beer
but
once
summer
is
over
i
do
not
drink
this
piss
water
ugh
seasonal
all
the
way
smells
like
moldy
bread
and
canned
corn
tastes
like
pennies
and
corn
steeped
in
tap
water
vile
with
lime
this
is
a
heavier
beer
i
enjoy
i
like
this
a

overall

i
do
feel
like
i
wasted
a

im
not
kidding
i
will
probably
pour
the
rest
of
this
down
the
drain
for
fear
of
illness
never
ever
felt
that
way
about
a
beer
before
this
one
id
avoid
it
if
i
were
you
worst
part
is
over
half
the
beer
is
left
probably
the
worst
lager
ive
had
in
a
long
time
if
not
ever
so
would
i
recommend
it
only
if
its
a
very
hot
summer
day
you
find
it
on
special
have
some
lime
and
need
some
waterbeer
then
yes
but
otherwise
its
a
no
its
just
a
big

this
stuff
like
most
mexican
beers
is
simply
bad
with
or
without
the
lime
a
marketing
made
swill
at
best
id
rather
have
a
malt
liquor
and
before
anyone
accuses
me
of
being
an
affluent
beer
snob
i
am
a
seasoned
biker
who
tolerates
pabst
on
occasion
because
its
cheap
not
too
horrible
and
often
the
only
nonlight
beer
at
a
biker
clubhouse
but
i
wont
touch
corona
tijuana
river

not

money
who
gave

me
back
to

for
me
this

realistically
this
is

everyone
knows
that
so
there
is
no
need
to
go
through
a

review
but
cmon
on
a
hot
summer
day
an
ice
cold
corona
with
a
lime
wedge
reminds
me
of
a
simpler
time
of
chasing

at

for
that
i
have

i
do
believe
this

would
have
been
more
complimentary
if
the

were
present
as
i
even
had
difficulty
selecting
a

imho
it
looks

it
tastes
like

id
rather
not

the

in

just
like
the
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
very
light
skunk
smell
then
some
grassy
hops
and
corn
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
touch
of
corn
sweetness
at
the
end
always
a
popular
brew
in
the
warmer
months
and
always
with
a
lime
wedge
as
well
corona
is
also
known
for
being
a
great
summer
drink
theres
nothing
like
a
corona
on
the
beach
overall
not
offensive
my
biggest
gripe
with
this
beer
is
that
it
costs
much
more
than
it
is
worth
plenty
of
other
options
that
taste
just
as
good
for
half
the
price
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
it
has
a
good
refreshing
taste
the
taste
is
not
to
strong
or
to
weak
the
smell
is
pretty
good
it
also
taste
really
good
when
you
put
a
lime
in
it
as
well
i
would
recomend
to
a
frend
to
try
this
beer
i
know
that
i
liked
this
beer
and
that
will
have
this
beer
again
a
rather
well
done
corn
dominant

not
bad

cold
for
maximum
enjoyment
tasts
of
sweet

and

crusty

light
to
medium
feel
with

id
take
corona
over
the
scores
of
similar
beers
foreign
or
domestic
any
day
overall
this
is
by
no
means
a
great
beer
but
everybody
knows
that
that
being
said
this
is
a
brew
i
do
find
myself
enjoying
on
occasion
at
the
stinking
hot
beach
in
mexico
yes
a
corona
is
welcome
while
its
composition
is
not
a
masterpiece
by
any
means
it
is
refreshing
and
dare
i
say
pleasant
its
skunkiness
is
debatably
by
design
and
has
become
a
characteristic
trait
of
this
brew
its
abv
is
low
and
its
produced
in
the
millions
of
barrels
yet
again
it
is
refreshing
and
hydrating
with
the
right
setting
would
i
pick
this
over
a
fresh
dipa
at
home
no
would
i
pick
a
fresh
dipa
over
a
corona
in
115
degree
weather
in
a
sunny
beach
maybe
never
had
the
option
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
drank
in
a
long
time
and
the
fact
that
it
is
best
served
with
a
lemon
is
the
best
prove
of
its
poor
quality
which
even
the
sour
cant
hide
they
say
corona
is
refreshing
in
the
sun
on
the
beach
but
lager
beers
in
general
are
and
there
are
much
better
picks
o
if
youre
gonna
buy
a
light
drinking
adjunct
lager
just
buy
budweiser
in
cans
its
essentially
the
same
thing
except
it
wont
be
light
struck
itll
be
20
cheaper
and
taste
better
mouthful
was
okay
besides
the
taste
it
wasnt
bad
or
good
definitely
something
i
wouldnt
keep
around
in
the
fridge
but
i
can
see
how
there
is
a
market
for
this
one
really
enjoy
coronas
just
returned
from
a
vacation
and
the
first
beer
that
i
wanted
to
drink
while
at
the
beach
was
sure
enough
a
corona
very
light
and
crisp
beer
that
is
extremely
refreshing
especially
in
the
hot
sun
always
add
the
lime
as
well
for
a
little
extra
bitterness
and
flavor
to
top
it
off
corona
was
really
just
a
test
i
am
trying
to
expand
my
horizon
i
did
not
care
for
it
if
i
had
to
chose
between
guinness
and
corona
i
would
chose
guinness
i
know
its
a
completely
different
style
of
beer
i
am
just
trying
to
broaden
my
beers
i
just
guess
i
like
dark
beers
more
than
light
beers
everyone
has
different
tastes
but
if
looking
for
a
light
beer
this
is
pretty
good
corona
has
a
very
watery
taste
with
a
hint
of
skunk
it
has
a
very
skunky
smell
and
it
feels
flat
and
uncarbonated
coronas
very
light
in
taste
but
at
least
their
commercials
are
cool
anyone
who
doesnt
like
this
beer
is
just
a
hater
because
of
the
hype
the
beer
is
light
and
is
very
refreshing
nobody
ever
says
nah
man
i
dont
like
corona
that
sentence
should
be
followed
by
a
slap
to
the
face
because
they
are
clearly
lying
to
your
face
classic
beer
pop
one
of
these
open
at
the
beach
and
youll
surely
enjoy
yourself
if
youre
feeling
extra
adventurous
stick
a
lime
slice
in
it
and
youll
have
a
great
time
this
is
very
refreshing
and
youll
get
to
taste
a
little
bit
of
mexico
awful
what
the
fk
are
all
you
people
drinking
because
i
want
some
what
bullshit
how
the
fk
can
anyone
think
corona
extra
is
awful
i
smell
a
rat
here
ok
it
is
over
pricedand
advertising
has
made
it
a
huge
huge
seller
due
to
its
beach
ice
bucketcell
phone
in
the
sea
dealand
the
whole
dumb
as
shit
put
a
lime
wedge
in
it
crap
but
awful
on
a
hot
as
hell
dayand
you
just
pulled
a
14
hour
shift
outside
sweating
your
ass
off
pounding
nailsor
paving
roadsor
doing
tree
workor
any
kind
of
real
workan
ice
cold
corona
taste
fucking
great
so
all
you
beer
snobs
in
your
air
conditioned
officespending
all
your
time
bashing
beer
that
is
actually
pretty
damn
awesomedo
all
of
us
real
beer
drinkers
a
huge
favor
and
just
shut
the
fk
up
and
dont
forget
to
tip
the
mexican
who
just
spent
12
fucking
hours
trimming
your
hedges
or
washing
and
waxing
your
beamer
in
the
100
degree
heatsnobby
bastards
overall
i
have
had
many
coronas
in
my
day
it
is
easy
to
drink
many
at
once
especially
with
lime
i
actually
prefer
it
over
your
typical
budweiser
or
miller
even
with
the
skunked
smell
and
flavor
but
given
the
choice
i
would
rather
have
something
else
honestly
its
not
worth
drinking
corona
if
you
dont
have
a
wedge
of
lime
to
put
in
it
drinking
corona
on
its
own
is
just
nasty
the
only
time
i
find
myself
drinking
this
stuff
is
if
im
getting
mexican
food
since
it
pairs
ok
or
if
im
at
the
beach
and
looking
for
a
cold
beer
to
drink
othis
beer
is
just
as
bad
as
i
remembered
i
would
not
suggest
it
ever
in
any
case
while
i
hate
having
to
review
this
beer
its
better
than
any
of
the
american
standards
miller
bud
coors
etc
overall
this
is
a
beer
where
i
find
the
first
one
tolerable
but
from
there
things
go
steadily
downhill
no
lime
added
here
either
i
imagine
it
may
make
it
a
little
more
palatable
though
overall
an
okay
sessional
beer
for
the
hottest
of
days
but
honestly
there
are
cheaper
sessionals
around
corona
has
dropped
in
price
over
the
last
couple
of
years
by
around
25
maybe
people
are
finally
realising
that
they
should
judge
a
beer
on
its
merits
rather
than
its
marketing
hate
the
color
of
this
placid
yellow
with
no
much
life
though
there
is
a
thin
ring
of
foam
aroma
isnt
great
not
too
skunky
thankfully
flavor
is
better
than
i
remember
meaning
it
doesnt
taste
like
piss
has
a
semblance
of
fruit
and
grain
and
skunkiness
is
dialed
down
this
particular
tasting
was
decent
but
ive
had
worse
bottles
wedge
of
lime
might
have
knocked
it
a
point
up
overall
this
is
alight
flavored
light
bodied
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
beer
on
100
degree
summer
day
if
splashed
with
a
slice
of
lime
the
beer
was
moderately
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
was
the
most
pleasant
part
of
it
it
had
a
refreshing
feeling
was
light
bodied
and
just
washed
down
so
clean
and
easy
this
is
not
at
all
unpleasant
it
is
not
sour
it
is
not
offensive
the
corn
sweetness
is
not
syrupy
and
the
lager
character
is
light
its
called
a
light
lager
its
easy
to
drink
and
because
it
does
not
have
any
complex
flavors
it
would
compliment
a
variety
of
food
from
chinese
to
mexican
to
italian
or
just
a
pastrami
sandwich
you
dont
have
to
think
about
this
beer
it
drinks
as
easily
as
water
with
a
sessionable
abv
there
is
a
faint
odor
of
sulfur
that
develops
as
it
warms
drank
1
because
it
was
in
the
bottom
of
the
cooler
where
i
was
nothing
else
left
tried
it
and
vowed
i
would
never
have
another
appearance
ive
given
better
looking
urine
samples
smell
smells
like
sugar
pops
taste
not
enough
fruit
in
the
world
to
make
this
taste
go
away
mouthfeel
carbonation
and
bubbles
overall
this
beer
and
the
people
from
mexico
should
be
sent
packing
back
across
the
border
while
this
was
a
step
up
from
my
busch
light
days
in
college
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wont
be
drinking
again
unless
its
the
last
beer
at
the
bottom
of
a
cooler
and
im
very
thirsty
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
skunky
aspect
made
this
different
from
the
usual
macro
adjunct
i
think
i
did
a
great
disservice
to
this
brew
by
pouring
it
into
a
glass
had
i
shoved
a
lime
down
the
bottle
neck
and
chugged
it
it
would
have
been
enjoyed
slightly
more
overall
there
is
not
a
beer
in
the
world
that
screams
summer
like
corona
with
a
lime
i
drink
this
one
solely
for
that
reason
that
sitting
outside
when
its
90
degrees
with
80
humidity
just
goes
perfect
with
a
pale
yellow
beer
in
a
clear
bottle
with
a
lime
stuck
in
it
even
when
drank
after
thanksgiving
dinner
it
hearkens
back
to
that
sticky
hot
summer
day
when
you
last
had
a
sip
and
felt
refreshed
for
refreshments
sake
not
because
its
a
good
beer
o
weak
thin
not
offensive
just
not
good
so
weak
and
watery
this
was
difficult
to
review
because
theres
so
little
depth
and
few
characteristics
this
is
my
58th
beer
review
and
only
my
first
typical
beer
brutal
seriously
this
beer
is
a
chick
beer
and
i
mean
that
chicks
drink
this
because
it
is
week
and
taste
watered
down
with
corny
corn
syrup
and
then
these
peasant
women
put
lime
in
it
to
over
foul
that
bad
waste
products
that
the
after
taste
is
cheep
beer
and
i
know
my
mexican
friends
who
grew
up
with
lots
of
money
from
their
parents
even
despise
this
uncultured
commoners
drool
i
could
not
imagine
offering
one
of
the
peasant
brews
to
some
one
like
michael
jordan
he
gets
the
sierra
nevada
torpedo
what
kind
of
vagrant
scum
trailer
trash
would
take
such
pride
in
furnishing
their
fridge
with
such
a
paupers
brew
and
then
to
compensate
they
put
lime
in
it
so
it
removes
the
taste
of
the
cancer
this
beer
is
to
my
mouth
a
beer
to
be
exclusively
drank
on
a
mexican
beach
or
as
a
michelada
not
worth
it
otherwise
off
flavors
are
very
mild
but
still
its
a
tasteless
beer
bit
shit
see
john
smiths
bitter
for
a
pint
now
that
is
a
pint
could
be
improved
by
being
john
smiths
bitter
we
feel
a
yorkshire
bite
could
be
added
to
this
watered
down
piss
we
feel
in
our
considered
opinion
that
a
barrel
of
john
smiths
bitter
cannot
be
matched
by
your
weak
weak
impersonation
if
its
not
an
impersonation
that
merely
makes
it
worse
always
impersonate
the
best
the
worst
stuff
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
considered
giving
up
drinking
after
this
took
one
sip
and
then
took
one
more
to
be
sure
poured
the
rest
out
removed
remaining
bottles
from
fridge
called
brotherinlaw
and
chastised
him
for
bringing
such
sludge
into
my
house
i
then
retired
to
bed
fearing
that
i
would
have
nightmares
never
again
my
initial
thoughts
were
that
i
had
wasted
a
1
75
on
this
bottle
of
beer
but
to
the
beer
defense
i
did
not
try
it
with
a
lime
wedge
or
two
and
i
know
or
now
i
know
what
that
is
so
only
time
anyone
should
drink
this
is
when
its
the
only
beer
available
at
a
resort
down
south
but
the
body
of
the
beer
its
main
flavor
is
what
really
sinks
it
the
flavor
is
that
of
an
oddly
rubberycompound
tasting
liquid
not
pleasant
no
complexity
take
away
the
harsh
jalapeno
bitterness
and
what
youre
left
with
is
a
one
dimensional
beer
of
no
particular
high
quality
compared
to
the
bursting
complexity
of
strohs
its
a
onenote
bitter
pill
as
i
said
i
just
dont
understand
its
popularity
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aromas
of
light
sweet
fruity
and
grainy
malt
with
hints
of
floral
hops
to
counter
the
taste
is
sweet
with
honey
and
fruit
light
bready
grainy
flavor
with
a
sharp
spicy
hop
flavor
with
a
low
to
moderate
level
of
hop
bitterness
light
to
medium
light
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
sharp
crisp
mouthfeel
nice
grainy
bready
aroma
this
actually
tastes
pretty
decent
without
a
lime
stuffed
into
it
corona
extra
has
been
my
favorite
beer
for
the
last
5
years
or
so
its
light
stout
but
not
bitter
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
however
corona
extra
contains
barley
malt
rice
or
corn
with
gmos
antioxidants
and
propylene
glycol
stabilizer
it
is
off
my
beer
list
what
a
shame
simply
put
lawnmower
beer
light
corn
adjunct
beer
with
the
faintest
trace
of
hops
slight
stewed
vegetable
aroma
straw
yellow
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
not
worth
my
time
writing
up
this
review
nor
your
time
reading
mine
pair
with
self
loathing
with
a
side
of
bad
taste
oi
am
a
sucker
for
cheap
mexicanamerican
adjunct
lagers
in
the
right
setting
but
i
fail
to
see
how
any
setting
could
be
right
for
corona
the
smell
is
either
skunky
or
nonexistent
and
the
taste
generally
follows
suit
i
dont
think
there
are
enough
limes
to
save
this
stuff
aka
wiawg
water
in
a
wine
glass
even
amongst
american
adjunct
lagers
people
really
seem
to
hate
on
corona
i
however
found
it
to
be
rather
unoffensive
and
noticeably
more
flavorful
than
many
of
its
american
counterparts
perhaps
getting
a
fresh
bottle
keeping
it
out
of
direct
sunlight
and
holding
off
on
that
lime
is
key
to
enjoying
this
o
one
of
the
worst
massproduced
light
lagers
out
there
i
hate
to
sound
so
harsh
but
if
it
werent
for
the
three
limes
that
i
shoved
in
the
bottle
this
would
have
been
an
absolute
drainpour
from
the
beginning
as
the
beer
sat
and
warmed
out
of
pure
neglect
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
continue
sipping
on
a
regular
basis
it
got
even
worse
i
suppose
its
drinkable
if
you
add
a
lime
or
two
while
its
ice
cold
anything
less
and
its
drain
material
go
for
miller
lite
if
youre
reduced
to
drinking
a
light
lager
i
taste
a
great
deal
of
german
influence
with
grainy
cereal
malts
a
pilsner
like
quality
it
simply
is
overwhelmed
in
water
obviously
water
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
and
so
does
corona
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
for
what
it
is
not
sure
why
it
gets
so
low
marks
on
here
its
not
horrible
i
have
had
friends
call
corona
mexican
p
water
and
i
respectfully
disagree
i
still
think
that
corona
triumphs
over
its
american
counterparts
such
as
budweiser
i
am
not
sure
when
skunking
a
beer
on
purpose
became
a
selling
point
for
a
beer
but
its
what
we
have
here
a
generic
yellow
color
not
much
aroma
a
light
flavor
best
accented
with
a
lime
and
not
much
as
far
as
finish
goes
besides
that
though
theyll
work
in
a
pinch
after
finishing
the
last
few
sips
i
concluded
that
this
was
my
refresher
course
on
why
i
stopped
drinking
this
beer
over
a
decade
ago
even
if
its
the
only
beer
at
the
party
i
would
avoid
this
and
drink
soda
or
water
over
it
o
i
am
antibeer
snobbery
but
this
beer
is
plain
foul
i
cant
think
of
any
type
of
meal
this
beer
can
be
good
with
theres
no
saving
grace
about
it
other
than
the
fact
its
good
for
slamming
down
on
a
hot
day
if
its
the
only
thing
you
had
at
the
moment
and
its
overpriced
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
then
again
nothing
remarkable
either
it
stands
in
well
as
a
lawnmower
beer
or
something
to
wash
down
your
meal
with
overall
its
always
an
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
the
summer
heat
not
the
most
flavorful
but
beats
some
of
the
other
aals
d
world
class
ok
i
know
that
corona
extra
is
not
technically
a
good
beer
it
has
a
generic
yellow
color
reminiscent
of
bud
light
it
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
and
what
is
there
has
a
slightly
skunky
aspect
to
it
as
far
as
taste
goes
its
just
ok
and
for
the
price
there
are
a
lot
of
better
beers
you
could
get
however
that
being
said
i
will
admit
that
i
enjoy
this
beer
when
it
is
served
very
cold
with
fresh
lime
on
a
hot
day
and
its
light
and
crisp
feel
are
probably
its
best
attribute
split
a
6
pack
with
my
brother
appearance
is
fine
looking
the
smell
is
decent
but
nothing
to
great
the
taste
is
alright
i
suppose
nothing
bad
nothing
good
its
fairly
light
and
much
better
with
a
lime
mouth
feel
is
also
average
overall
its
an
okay
beer
but
its
nothing
special
and
definitely
shouldnt
be
priced
to
what
it
is
theres
a
few
beers
i
would
prefer
this
to
but
many
many
more
i
would
rather
take
for
instance
busch
pabst
icehouse
samuel
adams
rolling
rock
hell
i
would
even
rather
have
budweiser
and
also
notice
how
all
those
options
are
far
cheaper
than
corona
i
do
think
they
put
something
in
the
water
in
making
this
beer
because
while
i
wasnt
impressed
i
craved
another
for
a
week
or
two
i
have
no
idea
how
this
beer
is
more
popular
than
heineken
i
must
admit
in
the
summertime
ive
probably
drunk
gallons
of
this
stuff
when
i
think
about
this
i
realize
why
i
always
made
sure
it
was
as
cold
as
possible
if
it
warmed
up
i
was
always
sorry
i
often
drank
it
in
mini
bottles
added
a
pinch
of
salt
then
juiced
about
12
a
lime
by
this
time
there
was
very
little
remnant
of
the
actual
flavor
of
the
beer
remaining
its
a
very
musty
smelling
beer
theres
this
faint
bitterness
accompanied
by
a
corn
after
taste
the
carbonation
is
also
a
killer
that
being
said
as
long
as
it
was
fully
doctored
i
wouldnt
completely
avoid
this
beer
but
i
definitely
cannot
and
have
not
ever
been
able
to
drink
one
straight
for
now
i
will
stick
to
beer
that
has
the
ability
to
be
delicious
on
its
own
o
the
clear
victor
and
still
champion
corona
with
a
lime
3
ugh
i
like
corona
extra
ok
ok
it
doesnt
get
good
reviews
on
ba
but
its
always
in
my
fridge
during
the
summer
i
think
it
has
a
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
all
thou
it
does
finish
a
little
harsh
its
inexpensive
and
available
everywhere
and
yes
i
do
drink
it
with
lime
rapido
rapido
i
woke
from
my
slumber
to
a
pounding
headache
resembling
an
intense
hangover
whatever
i
was
riding
in
was
dark
dusty
and
shaking
from
side
to
side
sweat
beaded
down
my
face
and
i
came
to
realize
my
situation
i
somehow
made
it
to
mexico
again
fuck
suddenly
my
transport
halted
and
i
flew
face
first
into
the
front
of
the
hot
metal
cab
i
heard
several
footsteps
definitely
those
of
short
mexican
men
the
back
doors
flew
open
and
i
was
blinded
by
the
sun
they
grabbed
me
and
threw
me
onto
the
dirt
no
mas
amigo
andale
i
looked
around
to
see
what
looked
to
be
the
great
wall
of
arizona
and
walked
in
what
i
thought
was
a
straight
line
the
mexican
van
took
off
spitting
dust
into
the
air
as
i
approached
the
border
line
i
reached
into
my
pocket
finding
a
little
crumpled
paper
with
my
handwriting
it
read
the
secret
ingredient
to
corona
one
part
mexican
water
one
part
chicken
piss
not
a
beer
worth
drinking
in
just
my
humble
opinion
mexico
makes
so
many
great
beers
sorry
this
is
to
one
of
them
no
taste
whatsoever
for
a
full
beer
it
tastes
lighter
than
a
light
beer
and
what
is
with
adding
the
lime
not
for
me
but
hey
whatever
floats
your
boat
this
is
the
mexican
version
of
budlight
absolutely
no
taste
to
it
a
beerflavored
water
you
are
better
off
drinking
water
at
a
party
it
has
a
nasty
skunky
smell
an
insult
to
beers
worldwide
i
can
only
imagine
what
corona
light
must
taste
like
good
lord
overall
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
again
unless
it
was
free
i
have
to
admit
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
before
i
tried
it
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
that
i
should
try
it
so
i
did
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
i
have
tried
the
smell
of
a
corona
is
unpleasant
and
skunky
at
first
but
the
taste
is
great
the
appearance
is
a
yellowish
color
and
looks
very
good
at
first
sight
some
people
say
adding
a
lime
wedge
to
your
corona
will
make
it
taste
even
better
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
this
beer
is
only
to
be
enjoyed
in
3
situations
1
the
beach
2
the
pool
3
a
hot
day
other
than
that
this
beer
will
be
too
much
this
beer
just
like
how
it
looks
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
beautiful
day
this
beer
is
light
and
has
a
bit
of
a
grainy
taste
to
it
but
in
a
sweet
way
the
bottle
is
very
attractive
and
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
on
vacation
corona
beer
is
a
bit
like
the
eagles
i
cannot
imagine
anyone
taking
the
trouble
to
really
dislike
something
as
light
and
smooth
as
the
eagles
music
but
if
the
eagles
are
your
favorite
band

you

i

it
gets
better
after

the

and
wearing
their
logo
and
the
fact
that
college
kids
and
girls
would
really
like
this
makes
me
not
want
to
buy
or
drink
it
if
something
bad
happened
and
i
wanted
some
beer
to
down
this
would
work
perfect
or
if
it
was
real
hot
and
i
was
bored

some
bubbles

aroma
hit
as
soon
as

some

821222why
this
beer
is
popular
is
a
huge
mystery
to
me
this
is
definitely
manufactured
for
the
gringos
and
no
actual
mexican
would
ever
drink
this
poor
excuse
of
a
beer
just
looking
at
the
gross
color
you
know
youre
in
for
a
bad
ride
the
beer
tastes
flat
and
stale
and
the
skunkiness
is
overwhelming
the
reason
people
drink
this
with
a
lime
is
because
without
the
lime
pale
yellow
the
smell
is
not
enticing
at
all
and
i
dont
recall
it
being
this
bad
cheers
very
light
an
watery
its
lawnmower
beer
and
it
accomplishes
the
wet
your
whistle
mission
drinkability
is
high
if
you
are
blitzed
not
so
much
unless
you
can
stomach
the
smell
d
i
would
take
any
canadian
macro
over
a
corona
but
its
still
beer
and
i
love
all
beer
so
i
cant
hate
on
it
too
much
i
mean
lets
face
it
this
beer
is
coming
from
a
country
which
doesnt
even
have
the
cleanest
water
so
how
can
their
beer
be
all
that
good
one
thing
they
have
done
well
is
commercialized
the
hell
out
of
it
so
i
gotta
give
credit
where
its
due
this
is
anything
but
good
i
wouldnt
even
drink
this
in
sweltering
heat
in
the
summer
like
the
commercials
suggest
i
honestly
dont
even
know
how
to
describe
it
but
its
a
bit
skunky
and
doesnt
even
taste
like
beer
its
borderline
syrupy
to
me
never
again
thats
all
i
know
does
the
nose
of
lime
is
due
to
the
scents
of
the
beverage
or
just
the
citrus
that
automatically
served
with
corona
i
do
not
know
anyway
the
taste
is
that
of
the
bottom
floor
of
adjuncts
lagers
just
a
little
stale
cereal
in
his
mouth
to
support
the
citrus
taste
and
recalled
as
a
little
cactus
juice
finish
unconvincing
and
without
great
power
that
recalls
both
the
corn
and
not
too
fresh
cactus
juice
one
wonders
just
how
the
joke
is
able
to
penetrate
all
markets
just
a
little
poor
thing
notes
maybe
a
drain
pour
ill
see
how
much
of
the
32oz
bottle
i
can
drink
poured
into
a
pint
glass
not
sure
what
the
point
of
that
is
considering
that
this
doesnt
really
form
a
head
or
produce
lacing
and
i
can
tell
its
color
by
looking
through
the
bottle
color
is
golden
no
head
nose
is
skunky
hops
thats
about
it
light
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
can
see
why
people
like
to
lime
this
up
faint
whiff
of
light
bread
not
really
much
like
beer
and
what
is
does
not
taste
good
pours
the
lightest
pale
straw
color
ive
seen
in
a
beer
active
bubbles
minimal
head
scent
is
light
watery
with
very
very
very
faint
notes
of
straw
and
hop
extract
taste
is
also
extremely
pale
with
faint
notes
of
pale
straw
and
hop
extract
one
item
to
note
the
scent
and
taste
is
so
faint
that
there
is
not
much
there
to
signify
any
cooked
vegetable
adjunct
notes
light
bodies
moderately
active
carbonation
dry
not
a
fantastic
beer
by
any
means
but
manages
to
avoid
too
many
off
notes
note
really
goes
taste
better
with
lime
i
strongly
believe
that
a
good
beer
will
taste
great
on
its
own
if
it
needs
a
little
assistance
with
other
accouterment
then
its
usually
a
red
flag
since
corona
is
always
served
with
a
lime
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
this
beer
is
not
the
best
beer
available
ive
tried
corona
without
the
lime
and
i
quickly
understood
why
the
lime
was
necessary
without
the
lime
i
found
it
to
be
undrinkable
the
lime
added
a
nice
citrus
flavor
that
made
it
a
little
bit
more
palatable
but
the
only
saving
grace
of
this
beer
is
that
it
pairs
quite
nicely
it
mexican
food
so
the
next
time
youre
at
a
cantina
enjoying
some
carne
asada
tacos
get
yourself
a
corona
for
all
other
occasions
drink
something
else
poured
out
a
can
with
no
lime
beer
has
a
soapy
looking
head
pale
yellow
lots
of
fizz
smells
sweet
some
processed
corn
and
faintly
smells
of
apply
juice
weird
taste
is
sort
of
cloying
and
corn
syrupy
some
mild
bitterness
and
some
annoying
bitter
seltzer
aftertaste
which
contributes
to
the
lame
mouthfeel
i
have
no
idea
why
or
how
this
beer
got
as
popular
as
it
is
oh
yeah
when
you
cover
up
the
terribie
skunkiness
with
a
lime
you
get
the
idea
perhaps
the
industry
standard
in
lousy
skunked
beer
and
sadly
i
doubt
anyone
can
avoid
it
until
the
day
they
die
everyone
eats
a
pound
of
dirt
and
everyone
drinks
a
pint
of
corona
this
will
be
the
last
time
i
pay
money
for
this
swill
i
never
thought
id
say
to
myself
that
id
rather
have
a
miller
lite
im
amazed
i
never
understood
why
this
is
the
most
famous
beach
beer
or
what
genius
decided
that
a
clear
bottle
was
a
good
choice
for
beers
that
youre
going
to
drink
while
sitting
out
in
the
sun
either
way
do
yourself
a
favor
and
avoid
this
beer
whenever
possible
there
are
many
more
refreshing
beers
that
arent
skunked
and
cost
less
crap
beer
hard
to
imagine
something
this
bad
is
the
third
most
purchased
beer
in
the
world
even
when
i
knew
nothing
about
good
beer
i
never
actually
liked
this
and
that
says
a
lot
d
average
d
summer
drink
when
nothing
else
is
available
but
other
than
that
very
simple
beer
with
almost
nothing
in
it
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
following
but
i
am
not
impressed
poured
into
my
chilled
but
not
frozen
mug
it
produced
a
two
finger
very
white
head
of
thin
bubbles
that
dissipated
in
less
than
twenty
seconds
its
color
is
that
of
light
amber
rating
a
4
on
the
srm
chart
smells
like
roasted
corn
and
malt
with
a
hint
of
lime
tastes
what
there
is
of
it
like
little
to
nothing
maybe
a
bit
of
yeast
sweet
malt
and
corn
very
weak
in
the
mouthfeel
department
watery
with
just
some
carbonation
sorry
someone
will
have
to
pay
for
my
next
round
of
this
brew
maybe
good
for
yard
work
but
not
food
as
it
does
not
lend
any
real
flavor
to
enhance
anything
i
suppose
it
is
so
popular
with
the
notreallyoldenoughtodrinkyet
crowd
because
it
is
cheap
and
because
having
a
limited
reference
as
far
as
beer
goes
they
do
not
know
a
good
beer
when
they
taste
one
d
ok
still
has
a
spot
in
my
heart
cold
one
on
a
hot
day
ok
d
drinkablity
is
good
an
easy
beer
to
pound
and
get
drunk
on
thats
really
the
only
thing
its
good
for
the
price
is
ridiculous
though
not
even
worth
it
d
very
average
if
your
the
type
to
not
get
easily
bored
d
it
goes
down
easy
ice
cold
beyond
that
buyer
beware
drinkabilty
not
very
by
itself
but
with
added
lime
and
little
salt
very
drinkable
on
the
beach
or
bbq
but
the
price
doesnt
make
it
a
regular
choice
of
mine
this
is
my
first
corona
in
quite
awhile
and
the
first
ive
ever
poured
into
a
glass
the
marketing
for
this
beer
is
amazing
they
somehow
take
a
terrible
product
sell
it
for
top
dollar
3032
a
case
here
in
pa
and
end
up
being
the
top
selling
import
oh
and
you
have
to
buy
some
limes
to
add
to
it
this
is
just
poorly
brewed
beer
people
the
nose
and
palate
are
loaded
with
corn
husk
cooked
veggies
and
off
chemicals
i
see
why
the
lime
is
needed
mouthfeel
is
watery
even
for
the
style
its
not
cheap
and
i
shouldnt
have
to
add
anything
to
my
beer
to
mask
its
taste
this
is
one
beer
i
will
always
try
to
avoid
d
in
reviewing
mass
producedconsumed
beers
im
aiming
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
not
just
be
another
beer
snob
writing
off
a
laymans
favorite
but
there
really
isnt
much
too
this
beer
in
terms
of
aromas
flavours
or
feel
the
only
real
plus
is
that
you
can
basically
chug
this
like
water
and
it
is
light
and
refreshing
with
a
lime
on
a
hot
day
its
not
a
bad
beer
theres
just
nothing
to
it
drinkability
the
addition
of
the
lime
is
its
only
saving
grace
its
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
casually
but
nothing
spectacular
dout
of
all
the
large
scale
beers
out
there
i
think
corona
pisses
me
off
the
most
only
really
enjoyable
with
a
lime
i
do
not
understand
why
limes
do
not
come
with
a
box
of
coronas
is
anybody
drinking
this
stuff
by
itself
without
a
lime
ive
never
seen
it
and
for
good
reason
because
the
beer
does
not
taste
well
on
its
own
wo
a
lime
or
lemon
but
it
can
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
at
least
thats
what
the
commercials
tell
me
seriously
this
stuff
is
that
bad
drinkability
well
okay
its
drinkable
sure
although
its
better
with
a
lime
to
mask
the
sulfur
and
even
better
when
actually
on
a
beach
in
mexico
otherwise
i
do
believe
its
nuts
to
pay
20
for
a
case
of
this
stuff
im
not
sure
what
i
hate
more
the
beer
itself
or
the
mindless
fanboi
zombie
culture
that
loves
it
yea
on
about
3
seconds
of
contemplation
im
sure
i
hate
the
idea
of
corona
even
more
than
i
hate
corona
itself
and
thats
saying
a
lot
this
beer
probably
more
than
anything
else
on
earth
ever
spawned
from
a
very
unlucky
yeast
cell
has
a
huge
following
built
on
nothing
but
image
and
advertising
dollars
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
yeast
reincarnation
no
doubt
only
those
unfortunate
fungal
microbes
with
the
worst
sort
of
karma
would
ever
find
themselves
in
a
vat
of
corona
wort
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
couple
fingers
of
white
head
that
lacks
any
sort
of
retention
no
lacing
smells
skunky
with
notes
of
grain
bland
lackluster
flavor
with
an
unpleasant
bitterness
to
it
this
is
what
necessitates
the
lime
as
noted
in
other
reviews
this
is
not
a
good
tasting
beer
even
by
macro
standards
still
also
as
others
have
mentioned
i
will
admit
accepting
one
from
time
to
time
under
the
right
read
beach
circumstances
with
a
lime
d
yes
on
a
cold
or
hot
day
especially
the
beer
does
taste
rather
bad
when
hot
almost
undrinkable
so
ice
cold
is
the
way
to
go
the
party
beer
imo
clear
bottle
crystal
clear
beer
pale
yellow
with
a
bright
white
head
that
disappeared
almost
immediately
leaving
a
thin
collar
i
really
dont
like
the
aroma
too
much
of
a
sulfury
hop
character
and
some
skunkiness
make
it
hard
to
take
musty
and
a
bit
sour
smelling
grainy
sweetness
and
the
same
skunky
hop
flavour
sort
of
floral
but
not
good
light
bodied
average
carbonation
dry
ill
continue
to
avoid
this
in
the
future
o
its
consumable
enough
except
for
the
abrasive
aftertaste
on
the
insistence
of
a
friend
i
squeezed
a
lime
into
the
remaining
half
of
my
beer
now
it
tastes
like
limeade
with
grain
squeezed
into
it
make
of
that
what
you
will
its
more
drinkable
but
no
longer
tastes
like
beer
overall
pretty
bad
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
gets
off
to
a
good
start
but
everything
is
downhill
from
there
the
nose
is
vibrantly
grainy
but
not
venture
into
more
interesting
hop
territory
the
taste
is
also
a
one
note
wonder
its
not
terrible
but
neither
is
worth
my
while
to
ever
have
another
for
any
reason
taste
become
outright
atrocious
if
its
anything
less
than
ice
cold
overall
i
enjoy
having
these
while
in
mexico
i
find
it
heavily
carbonated
and
slightly
overrated
the
taste
has
no
distinguishable
characteristics
no
hints
of
flavor
just
carbonation
with
lime
on
a
beach
in
mexico
i
can
enjoy
it
but
as
an
import
especially
any
time
outside
of
the
summer
this
is
not
my
beer
of
choice
very
low
i
couldnt
drink
the
rest
of
this
beer
i
rather
drink
bud
or
coors
over
this
awful
beer
d
very
very
drinkable
trying
to
be
generous
here
drink
these
by
the
dozen
if
you
care
to
d
im
not
knocking
this
beer
because
its
an
adjunct
lager
im
knocking
it
because
its
one
of
the
worst
adjunct
lagers
the
only
time
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
was
as
a
water
replacement
in
mexico
i
like
almost
all
the
other
bmc
style
beers
more
than
this
one
stick
a
couple
limes
in
it
and
serve
it
ice
cold
if
you
must
d
ill
admit
that
if
im
lying
on
a
beach
chair
and
someone
hands
be
a
cold
corona
with
a
lime
ill
drink
it
but
it
is
a
poor
beer
i
feel
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
overhyped
beers
on
the
market
id
heard
great
things
before
i
actually
tried
it
it
was
very
disappointing
if
im
going
to
drink
a
mexican
beer
id
prefer
modelo
negro
even
though
similar
i
think
its
a
good
alternative
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
chilled
probably
a
good
thing
because
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
awful
pisslike
smell
a
skunkiness
looks
the
same
too
i
guess
corona
is
an
acquired
taste
it
manages
to
be
stinky
and
watery
at
the
same
time
like
a
bud
light
gone
sour
alcohol
content
is
a
bit
lower
than
other
lagers
so
id
say
the
drinkability
would
be
on
par
with
a
light
beer
id
not
want
another
because
i
dont
enjoy
the
taste
or
smell
and
dont
drink
just
to
get
a
buzz
i
give
this
two
thumbs
down
especially
since
the
price
isnt
as
low
as
the
quality
still
a
lot
of
gulf
coast
floridians
love
this
stuff
their
choice
d
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
quickly
but
it
does
not
have
me
coming
back
to
the
taste
this
one
was
free
so
dont
judge
me
haha
served
from
bottle
into
a
blue
ridge
standard
pint
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
aggressive
pour
that
subsides
to
none
almost
instantly
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
present
at
all
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
and
a
small
hint
of
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
malt
sour
fruit
water
and
citrus
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
i
tried
to
be
fair
with
this
brew
in
my
rating
but
it
is
just
bad
i
have
never
really
been
a
fan
of
this
brew
and
will
probably
never
be
it
is
just
missing
too
much
to
be
good
maybe
this
is
why
the
tell
you
not
to
drink
the
water
in
mexico
p
s
anyone
who
says
this
beer
tastes
of
citrus
or
it
tastes
limey
should
think
about
the
fact
that
they
might
have
put
a
lime
in
the
beer
and
that
might
be
where
the
taste
came
from
if
so
that
is
not
good
reviewing
because
we
are
not
here
to
review
the
lime
juice
that
is
added
i
did
not
use
a
lime
and
i
am
here
to
tell
you
that
this
beer
has
absolutely
positively
no
lime
or
citrus
flavor
at
all
not
even
a
little
bit
nope
you
are
totally
wrong
if
you
think
there
is
try
again
with
out
the
lime
in
it
it
really
has
no
lime
flavor
none
whatsoever
really
seriously
no
lime
not
even
a
hint
of
citrus
none
nada
no
need
for
a
long
winded
explanation
it
looks
bad
smells
and
tastes
horrendous
and
gives
me
a
headache
every
time
i
drink
it
knowing
this
i
bought
another
six
pack
to
rate
yep
still
awful
pity
the
person
who
forgets
to
buy
a
lime
to
kill
the
flavor
d
light
beer
so
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
over
a
session
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
in
the
summer
only
i
never
buy
corona
in
the
winter
there
is
no
reason
doing
so
d
the
limes
make
this
beer
possible
there
are
better
mexican
beers
out
there
cheers
years
gone
by
billions
of
dollars
spent
corona
has
become
immersed
in
idyllic
images
of
pristine
beaches
sunny
settings
and
vacation
lifestyles
this
is
the
deceit
of
advertising
and
nothing
more
there
is
nothing
about
the
beer
itself
that
accounts
for
these
associations
it
is
as
lifeless
insipid
and
ordinary
as
any
other
massproduced
lager
overall
who
knew
that
a
wedge
of
lime
would
make
such
a
big
difference
without
the
lime
this
beer
would
not
even
be
worth
rating
but
add
the
lime
and
a
blazing
hot
day
it
becomes
somewhat
drinkable
so
heres
to
citrus
i
highly
recommend
the
chunk
of
line
that
most
bars
add
to
this
beer
it
is
the
only
flavor
there
is
to
the
watery
mess
they
try
to
pass
off
as
beer
rjt
not
very
good
overall
just
had
one
of
these
for
the
first
time
didnt
expect
much
from
it
but
it
was
better
than
expected
that
may
have
been
improved
by
the
addition
of
a
lime
wedge
i
usually
dont
have
much
of
an
appreciation
for
thin
beers
like
this
but
at
a
friends
house
on
a
nice
summer
day
i
would
definitely
drink
one
drinkability
must
admit
i
do
have
them
at
parties
and
bbqs
i
would
never
buy
themfor
myself
though
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
can
easily
demolish
a
6
pack
and
its
essential
for
summer
days
near
the
pool
this
beer
is
a
good
beer
just
to
relax
and
chill
out
you
dont
really
need
to
have
it
with
food
however
it
goes
with
most
meals
for
a
very
drinkable
everyday
beer
if
you
agree
with
this
review
you
will
also
probably
like
lionshead
d
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
but
only
if
im
in
the
mood
for
it
and
i
have
a
lime
to
drop
in
to
give
this
known
skunky
beer
any
flavor
review
must
be
over
250
characters
and
less
than
5000
apparently
we
shouldnt
be
snobs
but
shouldnt
not
be
snobs
either
d
while
not
awful
this
is
certainly
not
good
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
marginally
refreshing
but
generally
a
somewhat
rough
middling
mexican
macro
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
a
little
more
than
light
this
beer
isnt
very
good
overall
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
it
does
not
taste
good
it
is
decent
with
a
lime
in
it
but
what
good
is
a
beer
if
you
need
to
add
fruit
to
make
it
drinkable
this
was
probably
skunked
i
poured
it
out
after
a
few
sips
so
it
goes
d
despite
all
those
aforementioned
defects
eh
its
pretty
drinkable
it
is
pretty
similar
to
water
and
therefore
pretty
refreshing
if
its
available
its
easy
to
drink
drinkability
potable
but
nothing
to
it
no
depth
d
would
drink
this
more
than
the
extra
just
becuse
of
the
higher
abv
crispish
with
only
moderate
carbonation
and
a
remarkably
thin
body
dry
enough
that
you
dont
have
to
worry
about
the
flavor
hanging
around
too
long
but
nothing
offensive
enough
to
warrant
a
drain
pour
whether
you
want
the
extra
calories
without
any
kind
of
flavor
payoff
is
another
question
entirely
i
dont
so
i
poured
the
other
half
down
the
sink
i
got
the
idea
well
enough
to
know
i
dont
care
much
about
this
beer
one
way
or
another
think
its
time
for
a
green
flash
west
coast
ipa
still
not
sure
why
people
put
a
lime
in
it
though
and
this
stuff
is
just
as
expensive
as
sn
pale
jeez
notes
it
did
have
an
ok
mouthfeel
overall
take
this
for
what
it
is
good
cheap
beer
d
light
beer
so
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
over
a
session
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
in
the
summer
only
i
never
buy
corona
in
the
winter
there
is
no
reason
doing
so
if
it
was
free
id
drink
them
assuming
there
was
nothing
better
would
drink
before
almost
any
aussie
beer
and
easily
beats
budweiser
being
the
only
american
beer
ive
tried
d
theres
some
potential
to
drink
a
few
with
the
light
body
but
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
make
it
the
least
bit
enjoyable
wow
there
is
not
much
malt
flavor
in
here
at
all
i
am
guessing
the
adjunct
percentage
is
pretty
high
on
this
one
finishes
dry
and
with
plenty
of
carbonation
scrubbing
there
is
actually
a
fleeting
hop
presence
at
the
end
too
breath
of
alcohol
makes
it
feel
heavier
than
4
6
i
would
have
guessed
more
like
5
5
or
so
it
is
not
as
bad
as
i
remember
from
back
in
the
day
it
seems
these
cans
help
keep
some
of
the
skunky
flavor
i
remember
being
so
prevalent
at
bay
those
damn
clear
bottles
cannot
be
good
for
the
beer
middle
of
the
road
mexican
lager
for
me
could
certainly
do
worse
the
marketing
department
for
corona
has
the
easiest
job
on
the
planet
just
by
having
a
corona
in
your
hand
makes
you
feel
more
tropical
and
who
doesnt
want
that
i
love
drinking
corona
despite
it
not
being
a
great
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
on
a
cruise
ship
a
few
months
ago
and
it
was
not
good
at
all
but
i
will
continue
to
drink
and
enjoy
corona
my
motto
in
life
is
someday
my
life
will
be
a
corona
commercial
dgood
drinkablity
for
a
quick
fix
of
beer
with
minamal
enjoyment
should
be
left
for
college
students
or
thous
that
would
like
to
drink
beer
to
drink
and
not
really
for
its
taste
and
deeper
flavors
mfd
extremely
light
overcarbonated
prickly
feel
and
a
sour
metallic
twang
to
it
d
between
a
choice
of
this
and
the
mexican
water
supply
id
choose
this
handsdown
thank
god
i
live
in
america
yet
somehow
i
cant
turn
these
babies
away
if
offered
one
at
someones
party
they
also
seem
to
disappear
rather
quickly
every
time
i
drink
one
i
get
flashbacks
of
when
i
was
in
college
and
watching
hot
girls
get
sloppy
drinking
these
down
and
spraying
themselves
with
beer
as
they
tried
to
figure
out
how
to
get
the
lime
in
good
times
body
is
very
watery
but
surprisingly
this
could
actually
use
more
carbonation
its
quite
low
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
i
never
understood
the
hype
of
this
beer
and
thankfully
the
popularity
is
starting
to
wane
and
the
price
coming
down
for
shame
modelo
bottom
line
is
i
really
like
beer
so
even
a
sub
par
beer
aint
so
bad
notes
pretty
similar
to
other
beers
of
its
style
not
great
but
there
are
some
occasions
that
it
would
fit
well
in
never
really
a
supporter
of
fruit
pieces
in
beer
but
a
slice
of
citrus
isnt
a
bad
addition
to
this
this
is
not
as
good
a
beer
as
i
thought
it
would
be
you
must
shove
a
lime
wedge
in
the
neck
of
the
bottle
to
fully
enjoy
it
and
it
really
should
be
a
summer
beach
beer
not
that
good
a
taste
and
also
not
that
drinkable
not
worth
it
get
something
better
if
you
want
a
lighter
lager
libation
a
watery
mess
that
i
simply
cant
drink
unless
i
mash
citrus
into
the
glass
surprisingly
bitter
for
the
lack
of
flavor
its
really
surprising
the
popularity
this
beer
i
do
not
like
it
sam
i
am
note
also
why
would
we
need
a
lime
to
make
this
beer
taste
good
should
be
a
red
flag
right
there
its
a
bad
beer
all
the
way
first
of
all
there
is
way
too
much
hype
around
corona
amazing
the
affects
a
huge
marketing
budget
has
on
consumer
behavior
in
america
this
is
nothing
more
than
an
over
priced
american
style
lager
one
saturday
in
college
we
actually
did
a
blind
taste
test
to
see
if
anyone
could
tell
the
difference
between
a
miler
high
life
with
a
wedge
of
lime
or
a
corona
with
lime
and
alas
nobody
knew
the
difference
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
actually
preferred
the
high
life
over
corona
where
do
i
start
oh
boy
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
skunky
un
appetising
yet
morons
drink
this
all
night
long
its
appearance
is
extremely
pale
though
it
is
packaged
in
a
nice
looking
bottle
shame
that
little
to
no
taste
though
perhaps
you
could
compare
it
to
dirty
water
very
light
texture
in
mouth
though
not
smooth
at
all
drinkable
i
guess
if
only
option
and
basically
you
just
want
to
get
wasted
then
i
would
consider
it
2
thumbs
down
nice
after
a
good
jog
in
a
hot
beach
ice
cold
and
it
can
get
you
drunk
cheaply
other
than
that
no
point
in
drinking
this
pale
urine
like
colour
slightly
sweet
smell
starts
off
with
a
frothy
head
that
quickly
diminishes
no
lacing
whatsoever
tastes
flat
and
bland
its
only
distinctive
feature
is
a
very
average
sweet
citrusy
flavour
for
me
its
a
very
unenjoyable
beer
to
have
but
it
always
manages
to
make
an
appearance
at
parties
this
is
the
one
time
it
may
be
accecptable
to
drink
it
also
i
wouldnt
even
attempt
to
drink
it
unless
its
ice
cold
poured
from
a
bomber
size
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
no
freshness
date
on
the
clear
bottle
no
head
at
all
clear
pale
yellow
color
smells
is
distinct
almost
like
rotten
vegetables
flavor
is
pretty
flat
nothing
really
sticks
out
i
can
see
why
salt
and
citrus
are
often
used
when
drinking
corona
pardon
me
while
i
chug
this
while
it
is
cold
d
its
a
hot
day
out
so
i
wont
say
no
to
another
this
bewared
splits
me
in
two
before
i
became
enlighten
i
though
this
was
a
good
think
to
drink
the
problem
is
just
that
i
have
liked
this
and
without
it
i
would
never
attack
the
finner
things
of
the
industry
this
philosophic
thinking
may
go
on
a
while
but
i
will
hold
my
ground
right
here
you
can
read
30
different
reviews
and
you
will
get
30
different
opinions
i
am
a
proud
supporter
of
coronas
and
im
not
mexican
btw
lol
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
unlike
most
adjunct
lagers
can
actually
taste
the
pilsner
roots
i
hadnt
had
this
in
years
and
expected
to
hate
it
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
prefer
this
over
most
macros
maybe
it
helped
that
it
was
from
a
can
instead
of
the
clear
bottles
i
had
in
the
past
i
thought
this
beer
was
at
least
okay
a
few
years
ago
but
after
drinking
nothing
but
craft
for
the
last
couple
years
i
was
surprised
at
how
bad
this
was
we
now
what
it
looks
like
foamy
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
almost
no
trace
of
lacing
aroma
offers
munich
malt
corn
adjuncts
and
booze
taste
is
more
corn
cereal
german
malts
and
little
to
no
hops
carbonation
is
excessive
and
sharp
finish
is
moderately
dry
overall
lacking
real
flavor
very
drinkable
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
for
tailgating
however
it
has
very
little
flavor
and
does
not
really
compare
with
better
beer
this
beer
is
good
with
a
lime
or
lemon
some
people
like
to
add
some
margarita
salt
on
the
bottle
top
this
beer
is
also
known
as
panther
piss
this
beer
is
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
this
beer
is
simply
water
it
is
not
as
bad
as
some
i
e
miller
light
with
lime
but
is
only
better
because
its
flavor
is
not
repulsive
it
is
a
fine
drink
for
those
who
do
not
like
beer
but
if
you
are
looking
for
malt
or
hops
you
should
stay
away
overall
this
is
a
brew
for
those
whom
do
not
like
beer
or
simply
wish
to
party
and
have
no
need
for
quality
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
a
very
plain
and
generic
looking
beer
it
is
hardly
different
in
flavor
than
similar
beers
such
as
bud
although
it
may
beat
out
having
a
bud
light
lime
its
not
a
terrible
beer
to
have
if
you
out
to
a
mexican
restaurant
but
probably
not
my
first
choice
this
is
a
slight
improvement
over
the
light
version
the
body
is
darker
and
there
is
a
little
more
of
a
discernible
taste
to
the
beer
do
i
want
to
drink
this
no
but
given
a
choice
i
guess
i
would
take
the
extra
over
most
american
adjuncts
except
regular
budweiser
as
long
as
i
was
eating
texmex
again
this
beer
is
crap
gets
alot
of
hype
tastes
like
crap
and
is
priced
the
same
as
bass
ale
in
the
supermarket
what
gives
d
this
is
just
another
beer
to
use
to
get
drunk
with
one
of
the
last
beers
you
can
count
on
to
be
skunky
if
you
like
that
it
taste
almost
exactly
like
miller
used
to
taste
corn
and
clear
bottles
at
least
thats
how
i
remember
it
the
beer
does
look
pretty
in
that
bottle
it
isnt
bad
i
got
a
case
as
a
gift
and
im
not
complaining
cheers
gross
notes
now
i
know
there
are
different
opinions
with
regards
to
reviewing
these
adjunct
lagers
however
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
under
the
right
circumstances
i
love
an
ice
cold
corona
however
when
i
review
this
it
is
under
controlled
conditions
compared
to
other
beers
this
one
isnt
great
but
dont
let
that
affect
whether
or
not
you
would
drink
this
occasionally
you
dont
stick
a
lime
in
here
for
decoration
there
isnt
anything
special
to
say
about
this
one
but
it
has
its
purpose
its
needs
to
be
ice
cold
with
the
lime
on
a
hot
day
it
goes
down
as
easy
as
water
and
has
a
better
quench
factor
so
dont
run
out
and
buy
this
for
the
taste
or
for
may

imported

i
am
reviewing
this
without
a

which
seems
to
be
the
best
feature
of
this
beer
skunky
smell
thats
what
happends
with
clear

i
guess
the
lime
would
have
hid
that
no

crystal
clear

and
not

great

which
is
better
than
the

reviewed
this
only
to
bump
up
my
numbers
i
would
usually
avoid
but
it
was
free
why
do
people
pay
imported

for

there
are
much
better

beers
out
there
salud
edit
crap
i
actually
ranked
this
high
in
a
blind
taste
test
of
lowend
adjunct
lagers
need
to
at

increase
the
score
from
an
f
to
a
d
since
its
decent
for
a
crappy
version
of
this
already
crappy
joke
of
a

i
hate
american
adjunk
lagers
with
a
passion
p
s
better
drink
it
when
it
is
ice
cold
the
taste
is
the
same
its
light
but
highly
drinkable
nothing
special
here
at
all
but
in
mexico
do
mexico
pretty
drinkable
when
its
ice
cold
and
i
understand
the
whole
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
argument
but
ive
had
other
beers
that
are
equally
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
still
have
good
flavor
e
g
a
good
hefe
blond
or
wit
also
the
price
is
surprisingly
high
enough
that
i
could
never
justify
purchasing
it
d
this
is
probably
the
least
drinkable
of
the
adjunct
lagers
ive
had
the
smell
just
puts
me
off
before
it
even
gets
to
my
mouth
in
closing
this
bottle
was
actually
slightly
better
than
most
of
my
experiences
with
corona
it
was
definitely
less
skunked
but
for
the
price
there
are
a
myriad
of
better
options
out
there
taste
is
very
light
and
a
bit
hoppy
im
tasting
some
saaz
here
its
almost
like
a
really
bad
pilsner
ok
but
not
great
i
think
the
can
is
good
so
its
less
skunked
if
you
want
some
good
mexican
beer
try
negra
modelo
d
tough
to
force
down
for
some
reason
people
love
it
and
it
gets
drank
on
beaches
everywhere
i
just
dont
get
it
people
think
it
so
sweet
to
throw
fruit
into
your
beer
its
a
lot
cooler
to
drink
beer
with
fruit
fermented
into
it
final
thoughts
as
the
top
selling
import
in
the
world
corona
is
a
testament
to
the
power
of
marketing
a
squirt
of
lime
would
give
this
beer
some
flavor
and
help
its
case
but
on
its
own
its
really
only
appropriate
for
dousing
ridiculously
hot
mexican
food
or
having
one
after
sweating
on
a
beach
at
some
resort
frankly
if
you
put
it
next
to
a
light
lager
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
tell
the
difference
had
at
peppitos
on
chicago
ave
i
know
this
is
bile
but
i
will
say
there
is
a
place
and
time
for
this
lager
and
that
would
be
at
a
mexican
restaurant
it
was
ok
flavorful
and
went
down
easy
with
the
chips
and
salsa
and
my
tamales
so
as
i
said
corona
is
ok
at
this
point
and
time
and
not
much
else
i
did
enjoy
the
brew
while
at
the
restaurant
i
must
say
drinkability
i
really
dont
like
this
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
actually
can
say
i
dislike
rather
than
just
saying
i
dont
want
it
or
it
doesnt
fit
my
mood
or
that
theres
something
better
however
if
it
were
hot
outside
and
this
were
served
to
me
icecold
with
some
lime
a
bit
of
salt
and
maybe
a
burrito
no
problems
there
it
cracks
me
up
that
corona
which
is
lite
to
begin
with
actually
makes
a
lite
version
the
reason
you
have
to
add
a
lime
is
because
of
the
complete
lack
of
flavor
in
this
beer
i
know
that
the
lime
is
the
kitch
factor
making
it
look
cool
and
trendy
but
the
fact
that
it
just
doesnt
taste
all
that
good
should
keep
you
away
from
this
one
if
you
want
to
drink
something
mexican
with
your
mexican
food
grab
a
dos
equis
or
sol
theyre
both
much
better
choices
it
has
a
very
thin
appearance
in
the
glass
with
light
bubbles
resting
on
the
top
smell
is
bland
better
with
a
lime
on
the
top
the
flavor
is
ok
but
best
when
having
with
food
especially
mexican
it
is
heavy
in
the
mouth
with
carbonation
drink
on
a
hot
day
with
good
friends
i
must
have
been
lured
back
by
my
own
fond
remembrances
of
precraft
beer
life
where
the
sweet
paletteableness
of
this
beer
plus
lemonslice
and
the
unfailingly
good
times
that
surrounded
its
consumption
had
left
a
mark
in
my
mind
well
it
is
what
it
is
and
thats
an
adjunctladen
macro
with
little
to
excite
my
senses
when
not
surrounded
by
drunken
frivolity
pale
strawcolor
fizzy
shortlasting
head
thin
smelling
and
thinner
on
the
mouthfeel
the
overall
experience
is
of
an
ok
thirstquencher
and
little
more
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
thinking
it
wouldnt
be
all
that
bad
but
i
was
definitely
wrong
the
site
of
this
was
extremely
pale
almost
like
tinted
water
the
smell
up
close
smelled
skunky
and
unappealing
the
taste
was
nothing
special
at
first
but
after
a
few
sips
it
definitely
became
clear
to
me
that
this
beer
had
nothing
for
me
the
drinkabilty
was
ok
but
the
smell
and
taste
overpowered
me
from
even
finishing
the
stuff
drinkability
i
really
do
see
the
appeal
that
this
beer
has
for
some
people
it
would
certainly
be
refreshing
if
you
were
outside
especially
on
a
hot
day
its
extremely
chuggable
which
would
make
it
good
for
parties
as
well
trust
me
i
know
with
a
wedge
of
lime
there
might
even
be
some
flavor
to
this
beer
that
said
this
is
one
of
the
most
tasteless
beers
ive
ever
had
if
your
looking
for
flavor
go
elsewhere
the
6
was
about
a
dollar
each
the
smell
is
skunky
as
is
the
taste
not
much
to
the
taste
but
i
can
see
why
it
may
be
so
popular
due
to
the
lack
of
an
aftertaste
those
who
dont
like
strong
beers
and
just
want
to
drink
would
be
drawn
to
it
i
imagine
like
so
many
import
beers
if
i
was
to
grab
one
very
soon
after
it
was
born
and
drink
it
at
the
source
it
would
be
somewhat
a
good
beer
truth
is
it
just
is
not
any
sort
of
beer
to
enjoy
d
aside
from
the
complete
lack
of
flavor
it
really
isnt
offensive
way
too
pricey
for
what
you
get
the
quintessential
beach
beer
we
have
quite
a
few
beaches
in
minnesota
but
you
are
far
better
off
drinking
summit
or
grainbelt
up
in
the
north
woods
dont
bring
this
week
shit
up
around
me
the
one
thing
i
will
say
is
that
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
abundance
of
malt
i
felt
still
crappy
though
so
hey
its
corona
not
great
and
make
sure
you
drink
it
cold
if
its
what
cheap
and
they
have
some
limes
the
lime
is
almost
required
i
also
like
a
little
salt
around
the
rim
and
down
in
the
neck
its
not
a
good
thing
though
when
you
have
to
add
lime
and
salt
to
your
beer
to
make
it
passable
that
said
its
still
a
pretty
good
entrylevel
beer
once
you
dress
it
up
and
it
just
kind
of
works
with
mexican
food
pizza
or
a
day
at
the
beach
drinkability
is
there
if
only
on
hot
days
or
a
neighbors
party
when
nothing
else
is
available
found
one
of
these
in
the
fridge
and
figured
why
not
after
all
i
just
downed
a
double
dog
double
ipa
so
my
palate
should
be
pretty
well
toasted
maybe
itll
block
the
taste
i
know
corona
to
have
pour
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
vanishes
unfortunately
the
taste
is
the
same
as
i
remember
hint
of
skunkiness
though
not
as
bad
as
heineken
taste
is
american
macro
although
it
does
have
slight
hint
of
bitterness
this
is
ok
on
a
hot
summer
day
ill
drink
it
occasionally
if
its
around
but
its
not
something
id
ever
buy
cheers
this
beer
ivwe
drank
a
good
many
times
and
rather
drink
a
natural
light
or
a
budweiser
instead
it
tatse
like
what
i
would
get
if
i
held
head
under
a
cows
rear
end
to
long
i
drank
quite
a
few
when
i
was
very
drunk
so
the
next
day
i
ordered
one
at
a
bar
and
could
not
beleieve
i
even
drank
one
the
nite
before
pours
a
weak
pale
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
is
about
a
millimeter
and
fizzes
out
instantly
and
leaves
no
lacing
no
the
most
appetizing
looking
beer
carb
can
be
seen
rising
not
much
of
a
smell
some
malts
some
citrus
and
some
sweetnees
weak
smell
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
lots
of
citrus
water
a
small
malt
backbone
that
dies
fast
sweetness
too
yucky
mouthfeel
very
thin
way
too
much
carbs
and
a
weird
citrus
malt
aftertaste
that
im
not
a
fan
of
drinkability
pros
are
that
it
is
so
light
you
can
drink
it
like
water
cons
are
that
it
tastes
not
so
good
extra
what
anyway
pours
a
clear
straw
with
a
weak
wispy
head
vegetal
nose
maybe
the
barest
hint
of
grass
kinda
cidery
aroma
bland
watery
flavour
balanced
towards
bitterness
but
thats
fairly
relative
harsh
carbonation
and
light
body
somewhat
mineral
watery
pretty
bad
even
for
the
style
i
dont
trust
any
beer
that
is
required
to
have
a
lime
in
it
which
this
one
pretty
much
unanimously
is
ive
never
met
a
corona
purist
who
only
drinks
it
sans
lime
that
being
said
i
dont
think
a
whole
lime
saves
this
beast
it
looks
like
the
urine
of
somebody
who
is
well
hydrated
and
doesnt
taste
far
from
the
same
it
just
has
a
sour
grainy
taste
like
somebody
left
the
bottle
on
the
beach
for
a
week
im
sorry
but
this
is
as
far
from
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
as
you
possibly
can
get
verdict
dont
be
fooled
by
the
spanish
on
the
bottle
corona
extra
is
just
another
bland
and
watery
american
lager
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
served
with
beer
but
in
this
ones
case
a
lime
certainly
cant
hurt
d
the
taste
is
really
awful
i
would
have
pegged
it
for
a
non
alcoholic
brew
if
i
didnt
know
better
drinkability
i
mean
its
refreshing
when
served
really
cold
the
carbonation
and
cold
are
the
two
things
that
really
make
it
worth
drinking
on
a
hot
day
but
really
iced
tea
or
water
would
do
the
same
thing
if
youre
having
one
put
some
lime
in
it
its
more
a
citrusy
drink
at
that
point
and
less
of
a
beer
and
a
little
more
enjoyable
that
way
if
i
am
going
to
drink
fermented
rice
i
would
go
for
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
or
is
that
an
oxymoron
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
visible
carbonation
and
a
very
slight
head
the
smell
is
of
cheaper
hops
and
some
grain
notes
taste
wise
there
is
a
taste
of
cheaper
hops
and
of
grain
rice
or
corn
variety
the
taste
is
more
flavorful
than
most
adjucts
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
high
a
little
fizzy
the
overall
drinkability
is
above
average
for
an
american
adjunct
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
low
alcohol
volume
makes
it
very
drinkable
almost
no
aroma
what
so
ever
and
very
poor
foam
head
surely
not
a
beer
either
for
beer
snobs
or
connoisseurs
but
a
very
good
option
for
a
105
degree
summer
day
with
friends
very
drinkable
not
good
warm
but
who
cares
after
a
12hr
drinking
binge
in
cancun
gc
looks
brilliant
golden
yellow
in
the
transparent
bottle
always
had
it
with
a
lemon
wedged
in
the
bottle
gives
it
a
likeable
twang
to
the
otherwise
plain
taste
an
exceptional
summer
beer
that
can
be
consumed
all
6
pack
at
once
light
on
the
palate
could
have
been
more
malty
smell
is
hoppy
and
fresh
great
beer
to
go
especially
for
a
macro
level
produce
small
bit
of
foam
on
top
of
a
light
yellow
not
too
much
to
smell
or
taste
really
goes
down
pretty
well
mostly
because
its
pretty
thin
like
water
decent
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
when
your
thirsty
but
other
than
that
nothing
special
wouldnt
go
anywhere
seeking
for
it
guilty
pleasure
goes
great
with
spicy
mexican
food
i
like
whats
in
the
glass
better
in
any
case
this
swill
is
a
testament
to
how
dumb
people
can
be
shelling
out
15
or
more
bucks
for
a
twelve
pack
of
crap
beer
while
they
imagine
themselves
swinging
on
a
hammock
over
some
white
sandy
beach
in
wonderland
this
is
prob
what
coors
light
drinkers
go
with
when
theyre
on
vacation
d
its
drinkable
but
thats
as
far
as
i
go
i
only
drink
this
when
i
go
to
partys
and
free
i
fail
to
see
the
need
to
go
and
spend
imported
beer
prices
for
a
beer
that
im
going
to
modify
d
somewhat
drinkable
poured
from
a
clear
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
12
inch
head
mild
corn
aroma
taste
is
light
and
rather
bland
feels
watery
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
o
k
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
a
lot
to
it
very
ordinary
drinkability
for
what
it
is
i
feel
this
might
be
one
of
the
better
american
adjunct
lagers
that
i
have
tried
corona
always
tastes
the
same
the
bad
thing
is
that
it
tastes
like
racoons
ass
straw
yellow
pale
color
with
medium
head
formation
and
little
lace
retention
aromas
with
minimal
presence
of
malts
and
little
hops
very
much
bitter
in
smell
notes
tastes
of
little
malts
with
bitterness
finishes
dry
and
with
the
lime
in
the
bottle
and
the
beach
can
be
a
decent
avergae
macro
beer
for
all
that
though
yes
it
is
clean
and
inoffensive
but
its
also
shamefully
weak
good
for
chugging
and
getting
drunk
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thing
but
not
one
to
be
savoured
or
in
any
way
enjoyed
dont
even
know
why
im
reviewing
this
beer
but
its
the
only
beer
they
had
my
mates
place
as
im
sure
we
all
know
about
corona
already
it
pours
a
golden
straw
colour
and
has
hardly
any
smell
to
it
maybe
a
grainy
smell
but
nothing
else
and
does
not
have
much
taste
to
it
at
alldefinately
an
easy
drinking
beer
if
you
like
those
sorts
of
beers
but
the
only
time
i
tend
to
drink
this
is
when
there
is
nothing
else
on
offer
and
even
when
i
do
im
still
trying
to
reach
for
the
limes
this
is
another
of
those
beers
that
i
would
cane
if
i
was
in
country
but
not
gonna
touch
it
again
here
verdict
cheap
non
domestic
beer
that
is
slightly
different
than
domestics
in
taste
so
drink
if
you
want
to
down
some
beers
but
are
tired
of
the
sameolesameole
drinkability
with
a
lime
and
served
ice
cold
it
is
quite
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
if
youve
bought
into
the
advertising
campaign
overall
not
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
and
definitely
not
worth
the
import
price
if
you
want
a
lawnmower
beer
there
are
countless
other
options
for
a
better
price
drinkability
can
possibly
be
drank
again
wouldnt
usually
do
it
maybe
on
a
hot
day
or
something
thin
enough
where
it
might
be
thirst
quenching
but
probably
only
one
i
find
it
drinkable
but
i
think
if
i
had
to
drink
it
all
day
i
would
have
to
break
down
and
put
a
lime
it
to
cover
the
skunky
smell
i
donk
think
i
would
ever
but
this
its
not
worth
it
for
the
price
insted
of
30
they
should
sell
it
for
12
and
i
still
prolly
wouldnt
buy
it
ugh
rue
the
situations
where
corona
is
your
best
option
whereas
certain
hefes
or
such
could
gain
some
taboo
frivolous
sweetaccent
by
the
addition
of
citrus
this
beer
requires
it
just
to
reach
the
level
of
tolerable
it
looks
just
like
yellow
nothing
no
thank
you
smells
simply
of
adjuncts
sure
its
not
actually
an
offensive
odor
but
theres
nothing
enticing
about
it
flavor
is
just
all
adjunt
and
should
you
encounter
the
horror
of
sipping
it
once
its
warmed
a
bit
towards
roomtemp
is
mildlyenraging
mouth
is
thin
not
light
but
thin
and
has
an
acrid
feeling
drinkability
well
how
do
you
want
to
define
it
sure
you
could
chug
tons
of
it
while
at
your
frat
houses
party
or
at
some
sort
of
bbq
whilst
waering
your
khakis
and
possibly
before
pushing
one
of
your
bros
into
the
pool
while
hes
still
fully
clothes
but
as
for
considering
what
makes
me
want
to
drink
something
i
dont
think
so
bottom
line
is
that
lime
makes
all
the
difference
this
beer
is
perilously
imperfect
without
it
with
it
it
is
at
best
mediocre
poured
into
a
pint
glass
no
lime
white
soapy
head
that
disappears
into
nothing
within
seconds
pours
a
pale
yellow
smells
grainy
fairly
clean
but
with
a
bit
of
funkyskunkiness
i
cant
place
my
finger
on
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
and
undercarbonated
i
think
pouring
this
people
typically
have
this
out
of
the
bottle
knocks
out
the
fizziness
youd
want
tastes
has
a
faint
skuniness
to
it
and
a
little
bit
of
a
vegetablelike
sweetness
not
at
all
bitter
the
shear
simplicity
of
it
warrants
some
drinkablity
a
clear
bottle
makes
it
look
fairly
refreshing
drinkability
for
what
it
is
i
can
drink
several
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
think
of
plenty
of
better
beers
i
could
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
ive
had
plenty
of
these
over
the
years
when
those
others
werent
an
option
i
know
a
lot
of
you
will
disagree
with
me
but
this
isnt
a
totally
horrible
beer
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
extra
light
mexican
brew
just
dont
forget
the
lime
this
stuff
tastes
almost
toxic
as
it
gets
warm
and
theres
no
lime
added
drinkability
this
is
highly
drinkable
goes
well
with
pizza
wings
burgers
etc
pretty
well
anyone
can
get
a
corona
down
this
is
a
beer
you
can
slam
all
you
want
it
is
what
it
is
and
its
popular
under
the
right
set
of
circumstances
you
can
enjoy
it
for
what
its
worth
for
free
this
one
really
is
a
steal
this
beer
is
a
flat
out
embarrassment
especially
given
the
cost
and
marketing
of
this
swill
i
dont
care
how
hot
it
is
outside
or
how
many
lawns
ive
mowed
i
will
not
be
ordering
this
beer
ever
again
even
for
free
as
bad
a
beer
as
ive
had
in
some
time
d
easy
to
drink
not
becuase
of
taste
but
becuase
of
its
thin
body
dont
let
it
warm
would
never
buy
this
beer
but
would
drink
it
if
someone
handed
me
one
like
tonight
i
liked
it
better
then
dos
equis
d
this
is
probably
the
best
part
of
the
beer
i
believe
this
is
still
a
drinkable
summer
beer
as
long
as
you
wedge
a
good
piece
of
lime
in
there
it
wont
win
a
blue
ribbon
after
all
but
its
drinkable
good
carbonation
keeps
this
from
being
a
complete
stinker
fairly
light
bodied
so
a
decent
hot
weather
chugger
this
beer
is
a
guilty
pleasure
for
me
i
have
no
trouble
downing
these
with
spicy
texmex
or
wings
or
whatever
the
lime
actually
gives
it
complexity
but
if
you
have
to
introduce
something
to
the
final
product
you
need
to
suspect
so
major
faults
theres
other
much
better
macro
out
there
and
much
better
mexican
beer
ill
be
honest
this
isnt
all
that
bad
but
it
is
a
hot
day
and
i
just
had
a
burger
with
some
slightly
spicy
bbq
sauce
so
it
may
be
the
situation
helping
the
beer
that
being
said
i
could
think
of
plenty
of
beers
that
id
rather
have
in
the
summer
heat
d
for
me
its
very
drinkable
for
what
it
is
nice
cold
summer
beverage
you
dont
expect
the
world
when
you
have
a
corona
and
always
add
the
lime
mouthfeel
drinkability
perhaps
its
the
bomber
of
corona
i
have
drank
speaking
the
beer
is
thin
and
watery
while
the
beer
is
absolutely
cold
the
drinkability
isnt
terrible
the
carbonation
is
active
but
not
stinging
so
for
me
this
is
an
improvement
over
bud
and
its
ilk
if
i
had
some
lime
in
this
beer
i
might
even
be
enjoying
it
ok
if
the
price
is
right
whats
the
right
price
when
someone
else
is
buying
you
a
beer
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
free
it
has
one
of
the
most
solid
bodies
of
any
macro
adjunct
lager
which
is
still
only
mediumlight
decent
carbonation
as
with
other
adjunct
lagers
the
lack
of
flavor
lends
to
drinkability
its
easy
to
put
back
but
lets
call
it
what
it
is
fermented
junk
food
do
not
drink
this
unless
its
an
emergency
average
in
feel
and
quite
drinkable
given
its
light
structure
and
lack
of
offenses
nonetheless
this
beer
is
ridiculously
overpriced
for
what
it
is
d
i
love
this
beer
down
by
the
shore
pool
or
bbq
slam
them
back
and
have
a
good
time
my
friends
rave
about
corona
and
if
they
like
it
thats
cool
problem
is
i
really
dont
see
the
appeal
i
think
its
because
before
i
tried
it
i
was
drinking
the
more
expensive
stuff
like
guiness
and
sam
adams
i
think
im
a
spoiled
beer
drinker
taste
more
skunk
to
quote
the
notes
i
wrote
when
i
drank
the
beer
yuck
final
thoughts
if
you
wanna
drink
it
get
a
lime
it
helps
with
the
unpleasent
taste
drink
on
hot
days
cinco
de
mayo
sorry
if
i
offended
anyone
and
i
realize
that
beer
in
clear
bottles
gets
skunked
quickly
in
the
sun
but
this
beer
did
not
see
the
sun
and
it
was
bad
they
get
even
worse
with
age
two
thums
down
final
thoughts
this
shit
straight
blows
its
expensive
shit
too
d
i
had
to
drop
a
lime
in
it
as
it
warms
up
but
still
not
very
good
out
of
a
pint
glass
i
just
popped
open
another
one
dropped
a
lime
in
and
took
a
swig
thats
a
world
of
difference
it
just
hits
the
palate
differently
of
the
bottle
also
if
its
hot
out
and
im
by
the
pool
or
on
the
beach
ill
give
it
a
shot
no
sense
in
bringing
a
nice
ipa
out
the
sun
to
skunk
thats
about
it
i
exaggerate
a
little
dont
pretend
you
didnt
enjoy
it
overall
i
think
this
beer
gets
an
undeserved
bad
reputation
if
its
the
skunk
taste
that
gets
you
give
it
a
try
in
cans
if
you
can
find
it
really
above
average
taste
for
a
macro
adjunct
can
be
a
little
pricy
for
what
it
is
though
picked
up
a
big
24
oz
bottle
and
a
burrito
to
celebrate
cinco
de
mayo
popped
a
couple
of
lime
wedges
into
bottle
fizzy
yellow
color
almost
see
through
body
smelled
like
water
tasted
like
fizzy
lime
water
gotta
have
some
lime
in
here
to
give
it
a
little
zing
otherwise
you
are
not
working
with
much
listen
you
dont
drink
corona
for
flavor
it
became
the
king
of
beach
beers
for
a
reason
drinkability
you
can
drink
one
of
these
in
your
sleep
awake
or
asleep
not
much
to
write
home
about
when
youre
done
d
being
it
cinco
de
mayo
ill
probably
put
my
entire
6
pack
down
no
problem
but
from
now
on
i
will
never
have
them
without
the
lime
in
the
bottle
its
the
only
way
everyone
ive
talked
to
either
hates
or
loves
this
beer
i
as
a
matter
of
fact
think
its
great
its
the
perfect
summer
beer
just
add
a
lime
and
your
set
to
enjoy
the
day
in
the
backyard
pool
or
a
swimup
bar
its
light
and
refreshing
its
not
meant
to
be
the
king
of
beers
so
dont
go
buying
this
beer
thinking
youre
gonna
get
some
overthetop
quality
mexican
beer
ill
always
chose
corona
over
its
peers
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
but
the
whole
beer
gets
bumped
up
a
couple
grades
with
a
lime
in
it
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
i
can
only
imagine
how
awful
the
light
must
be
d
i
feel
violated
honestly
i
think
this
would
be
pretty
good
served
ice
cold
as
part
of
a
michelada
but
as
a
standalone
drink
its
pretty
rough
sailing
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
corny
sweetness
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
faint
bland
boring
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
this
isnt
a
very
good
beer
and
i
dont
understand
its
popularity
for
the
style
this
is
not
drinkable
at
all
this
isnt
beer
it
ceased
being
beer
about
2
weeks
into
its
clear
bottle
journey
to
america
nothing
distinguishable
and
its
pretty
much
only
drinkable
when
the
weather
is
blistering
the
beer
is
ice
cold
so
you
dont
notice
the
taste
and
with
a
lime
mmmm
lime
i
will
never
get
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
and
how
people
think
they
have
a
distinguished
taste
by
drinking
it
because
its
not
bud
light
the
only
time
its
acceptable
to
drink
corona
is
at
a
beach
party
with
buddies
other
than
this
corona
serves
no
purpose
an
absolute
sorry
excuse
for
a
beer
tastes
smells
looks
and
drinks
terrible
i
would
much
rather
go
with
a
tecate
or
negra
modelo
if
i
want
something
south
of
the
border
drinkability
not
a
favorite
in
the
macro
group
even
if
you
add
a
lime
it
still
does
not
taste
good
i
would
not
turn
it
down
at
a
party
but
i
would
also
never
buy
it
despite
all
of
its
flaws
and
lack
thereofs
corona
can
be
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
maybe
theyve
done
a
hell
of
a
marketing
job
but
if
its
a
hot
summer
day
particularly
on
the
beach
this
is
the
first
thing
ill
pick
up
in
the
store
quenches
the
thirst
refreshes
and
washes
down
really
it
wasnt
meant
for
much
else
was
it
drinkability
not
good
at
least
i
tried
it
in
summary
is
it
just
canned
overcarbonated
water
with
poorly
brewed
and
processed
cereal
grains
as
with
others
this
beer
has
a
great
color
and
appearance
but
when
you
get
down
to
tasting
the
beer
it
is
very
unpleasant
and
does
not
fit
my
personal
beer
drinking
tastes
i
dont
ever
imagine
me
going
anywhere
and
picking
this
beer
up
with
a
meal
or
for
any
other
reason
no
lime
for
me
since
i
was
reviewing
but
usually
i
squeeze
the
lime
over
the
top
of
the
bottle
pour
the
beer
out
and
then
lick
the
bottle
while
sitting
on
the
beach
like
a
lime
popsicle
d
world
class
i
have
friends
that
love
this
but
i
cannot
understand
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
skunky
smell
worst
of
any
beer
ive
ever
drank
after
2
of
these
im
done
heavy
feeling
and
nausea
ive
heard
people
say
corona
doesnt
taste
like
beer
they
are
right
it
doesnt
i
guess
the
limes
make
it
better
it
would
have
too
no
offense
corona
folks
but
i
just
cant
handle
it
but
to
each
its
own
dr
based
on
this
one
today
id
have
to
say
not
so
much
but
based
on
last
summer
hammocksweatlime
its
very
very
drinkable
i
think
more
research
is
necessary
overall
its
not
the
quite
thing
you
would
actually
enjoy
either
drink
something
else
or
dont
drink
at
all
well
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
either
like
it
or
you
dont
we
i
dont
the
appearance
is
very
commercialized
very
pale
to
yellow
the
smell
is
that
of
gym
socks
the
taste
is
well
there
really
is
no
taste
the
drinkability
is
very
bad
the
after
taste
makes
you
want
to
use
sandpaper
to
get
rid
of
it
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
beer
a
lot
but
this
is
not
one
worthy
of
calling
beer
d
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
youre
laying
on
the
beach
eating
street
food
in
an
exotic
caribbean
destination
a
corona
is
called
for
other
than
that
look
around
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
with
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
very
weak
but
atleast
theres
noticeable
tones
such
as
weak
hop
even
weaker
malt
and
a
small
amount
of
citrus
tastes
is
the
exact
same
as
the
smell
however
i
find
the
citrus
note
to
just
be
annoying
mouthfeel
was
poorly
carbonated
and
only
a
small
step
above
water
still
just
as
drinkable
as
anything
else
of
the
style
i
almost
forget
that
i
am
drinking
a
beer
when
i
have
this
it
more
reminds
me
of
a
soda
that
was
never
sweetened
pours
a
yellow
sand
like
color
or
maybe
im
just
associating
it
with
those
great
commercials
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
no
head
worthy
of
mention
smelled
malty
and
bitter
with
a
very
light
bitter
taste
that
mellows
out
dont
drink
it
without
a
lime
wedge
my
favorite
macro
beer
and
i
dont
mind
it
at
times
but
definitely
should
only
be
consumed
during
the
three
warm
months
of
the
year
d
lots
of
macros
are
at
least
easy
to
take
down
but
ive
never
really
enjoyed
corona
something
about
a
beer
that
99
of
the
time
you
see
with
a
lime
in
it
seems
odd
to
me
if
it
needed
something
extra
shouldnt
it
have
come
that
way
i
wouldnt
recomend
this
at
all
try
something
else
note
that
after
this
beer
i
had
a
blue
moon
man
did
it
taste
good
by
comparison
d
i
find
it
hard
to
drink
based
on
the
aftertaste
and
the
lingering
presence
of
its
poor
quality
d
almost
as
easy
to
drink
as
water
but
not
tastier
than
water
this
is
making
me
wish
that
this
wasnt
the
last
beer
left
in
the
office
fridge
after
an
overly
long
friday
afternoon
company
staff
meeting
but
thats
now
neither
here
nor
there
corona
is
what
it
sets
out
to
be
fizzy
grainy
skunky
as
a
feature
not
a
flaw
and
sexy
in
its
foreign
grittiness
blah
but
im
not
about
to
lay
down
in
front
of
this
particular
bulldozer
tastes
similar
a
little
bit
skunky
and
metalish
but
not
so
horrible
that
you
want
to
spit
it
out
all
over
the
place
i
just
kept
thinking
to
myself
what
the
hell
is
that
taste
it
is
drinkable
but
i
can
remember
why
i
prefer
these
things
with
a
lime
it
it
its
corona
i
mean
what
do
you
expect
its
pretty
awful
but
somehow
drinkable
d
3
0
i
actually
dig
the
high
carbo
citrus
hints
in
this
brew
comments
not
really
an
off
taste
until
it
warms
up
and
then
it
is
not
good
to
drink
at
all
refreshing
while
still
cold
without
a
lime
it
is
plain
but
with
a
lime
it
is
not
too
bad
i
know
fruit
shouldnt
be
added
but
trying
it
with
and
without
is
a
good
idea
this
beers
has
its
place
but
its
usually
with
a
lime
and
some
salt
and
being
sipped
on
a
beach
somewhere
not
strong
its
real
good
on
a
hot
day
or
a
bbq
drinkability
the
only
thing
about
this
beer
thats
expected
to
be
decent
at
all
is
the
drinkability
as
you
can
drink
it
just
as
good
as
you
could
any
water
you
would
get
from
the
tap
gotta
be
a
beer
you
have
ice
cold
in
the
summer
at
the
beach
or
something
nothing
stellar
here
and
if
looking
for
a
light
beer
even
id
still
go
else
where
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
just
on
a
regular
night
while
watching
a
fight
or
a
game
this
can
be
an
extremely
good
beer
to
just
kick
back
and
hammer
dont
have
to
worry
about
tasting
notessavoring
i
can
drink
12
of
these
in
one
night
with
no
problem
minus
the
stumbling
mouthfeel
is
spritzy
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
lemony
semidry
in
the
finish
notes
from
71504
despite
the
bad
rap
this
south
of
the
border
brew
gets
its
still
my
favorite
macro
and
definitely
has
its
time
and
place
i
usually
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
and
yes
gasp
i
use
a
lime
yummy
sigh
im
really
quite
surprised
at
the
consistent
ds
and
fs
this
beer
receives
compared
to
others
in
its
class
i
dont
really
think
it
deserves
them
i
tried
to
rate
it
fairly
here
and
compare
it
to
other
beers
in
its
class
lets
be
honest
its
not
a
great
beer
but
in
its
class
it
certainly
rates
better
than
some
of
the
other
american
macros
i
remember
once
upon
a
time
thinking
that
all
beers
were
like
macro
lagers
and
someone
suggested
that
i
try
corona
i
was
actually
pleasantly
surprised
comparatively
speaking
i
wont
buy
it
now
and
if
someone
handed
me
one
i
would
sip
it
to
be
polite
but
i
probably
wouldnt
finish
it
but
compared
to
say
bud
or
coors
its
definitely
better
lets
just
say
if
this
were
to
go
above
40f
i
think
youd
have
to
get
rid
of
it
immediately
but
hey
if
its
a
hot
day
and
you
can
polish
this
off
in
under
23
minutes
then
mission
accomplished
i
suppose
and
yeah
forget
about
a
glass
just
do
the
lime
thing
and
go
straight
out
the
bottle
i
cant
imagine
why
people
pay
for
this
stuff
its
basically
just
overpriced
imported
budweiser
if
prices
were
equal
id
probably
choose
this
over
bud
but
is
that
honestly
saying
much
i
prefer
bud
over
this
lager
and
many
many
others
drinkability
very
easy
only
good
for
long
hot
days
drink
this
ice
cold
with
a
wedge
of
lime
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
its
awesome
without
the
lime
and
in
the
middle
of
winter
its
just
not
very
nice
why
bother
with
this
i
have
no
idea
why
it
is
so
popular
d
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
these
all
night
i
dont
understand
why
pop
culture
has
let
us
believe
that
this
is
good
beer
i
remembering
being
younger
and
seeing
in
movies
hearing
music
and
other
places
that
corona
was
great
beer
what
really
it
tastes
like
its
been
left
in
a
steel
drum
for
months
when
i
drink
a
corona
all
i
can
taste
is
metal
and
the
piss
coming
through
there
are
some
many
better
mexican
beers
out
there
do
yourself
a
favor
and
stay
far
away
from
corona
great
session
beer
especially
if
you
are
just
planning
on
relaxing
outside
on
a
warm
summer
evening
you
know
what
despite
the
fact
that
the
beer
doesnt
have
an
exceptional
taste
it
still
is
a
good
kickback
beer
better
than
light
beers
it
is
refreshing
and
crisp
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
most
other
beers
but
as
far
as
good
beers
to
just
relax
with
it
is
really
nice
no
bad
smell
no
bad
taste
i
just
think
of
the
bad
guy
from
el
mariachi
smile
and
drink
taste
is
mild
malt
sweetness
with
a
fair
amount
of
hop
or
hop
extract
leaving
a
bitterness
in
the
back
and
center
of
the
tongue
reminds
me
of
many
european
pilsners
though
a
bit
light
on
the
hops
finish
is
slightly
dry
thanks
to
the
4
6abv
it
is
quite
sessionable
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
very
similar
to
many
american
macros
but
this
has
a
bit
more
hops
good
beer
with
food
and
it
wont
fill
you
up
overall
for
the
love
of
god
stop
importing
this
crap
there
are
plenty
of
equally
crap
beers
brewed
in
your
country
unless
you
are
unlucky
enough
to
live
in
a
country
with
little
beer
production
a
very
light
tasteless
beer
drinkable
no
drainpour
yes
what
can
one
say
about
this
beer
it
doesnt
have
an
offensive
taste
or
a
good
taste
to
start
its
an
ugly
looking
color
which
makes
me
wonder
why
they
have
it
in
a
clear
bottle
it
has
a
bitter
skunk
buildup
that
leaves
a
nasty
aftertaste
if
you
continue
to
drink
it
smell
is
bleh
mouthfeel
nothing
special
all
and
all
life
is
too
short
to
waste
on
this
kind
of
lager
which
there
is
far
to
much
of
in
the
world
today
i
wouldnt
have
even
drank
it
except
my
aunt
sent
it
along
with
some
other
stuff
she
gave
us
from
her
bar
ive
had
seltzer
water
with
a
more
pleasant
and
strong
taste
what
can
you
say
about
this
classic
summertime
drink
obviously
this
wont
win
over
any
beer
purists
or
those
who
actually
enjoy
the
taste
of
a
good
beer
but
it
does
have
its
place
on
a
hot
day
with
a
slice
of
lime
not
a
good
beer
but
a
very
good
drink
on
a
hot
day
preferably
in
mexico

overall
i
used
to
think
this
was
drinkable
but
last
night
i
couldnt
even
finish
the
beer
corona
is
only
palatable
if
you
hide
its
smell
and
taste
with
a
lemon
or
lime
wedge
ive
never
liked
corona
i
always
thought
it
was
overpriced
when
i
was
in
high
school
because
all
my
friends
drank
it
i
never
understood
why
i
guess
it
was
the
cool
thing
whenever
someone
handed
me
one
the
only
way
i
could
drink
it
without
giving
a
shot
face
yea
a
shot
face
after
drinking
beer
was
to
put
a
lime
wedge
in
it
for
this
i
got
so
much
crap
from
my
friends
real
men
dont
put
fruit
in

i
must

on

i
dont

one
of

etc
all
are
considered
not
recommended
drinkability
at
parties
in
the
summer
where
my
options
are
miller
lite
from
the
keg
or
corona
from
the
fridge
i
can
happily
drink
a
half
dozen
of
these
perros
or
more
without
feeling
much
of
anything
gotta
have
about
5
limes
wedged
in
to
the
last
one
if
youre
gonna
drink
that
many
though
i
had
this
in
the
bottle
with
no
lime
i
only
had
two
and
got
no
buzz
but
somehow
it
gave
me
a
terrible
headache
this
is
a
very
overrated
beer
it
reminds
of
some
miller
stuff
except
its
nastier
and
more
expensive
than
anything
miller
makes
i
will
never
buy
this
again
for
me
this
is
good
at
the
beach
or
barbecue
but
once
fall
arrives
i
dont
consider
another
until
memorial
day
unless
its
free
of
course
pale
yellow
with
a
little
foam
in
general
it
tastes
like
if
it
was
frozen
and
then
put
in
the
sun
what
is
sometimes
called
burned
i
would
avoid
to
drink
this
beer
as
much
as
possible
since
the
after
taste
is
a
little
anoying
it
is
known
as
coronita
in
spain
due
to
some
legal
issues
but
coronita
in
mexico
is
a
smaller
presentation
no
cans
found
in
mexico
but
available
in
the
usa
unless
served
with
limes
plural
this
beer
is
very
unenjoyable
and
most
likely
undrinkable
drinkability
a
worldfamous
brand
but
one
of
the
most
overrated
ones
too
i
have
had
better
stuff
from
mèxico
uh

quite
possibly
one
of
the
worst
beers
on
the

5notes
my
1st
review
its
fitting
that
it
should
be
of
a
beer
that
i
thought
was
so
cool
in
my
younger
days
ive
since
tasted
beer
that
makes
corona
taste
like
water
and
from
my
experience
pale
gold
clear
liquid
tiny
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
moving
very
slow
thick
white
foamy
head
head
retention
was
ok
pale
skunky
aroma
slightly
floral
very
pale
malt
flavor
not
much
bitterness
maybe
a
hint
of
floral
hop
flavor
at
the
end
but
not
much
standing
out
light
body
watery
high
carbonation
not
much
going
on
here
in
terms
of
flavor
or
eye
candy
pass
mouthfeel
is
paper
thin
with
small
bubbly
carbonation
but
no
backbone
at
all
this
is
not
a
brew
i
would
choose
to
drink
as
there
are
many
better
however
if
i
can
drink
it
at
work
and
its
free
why
not
probably
the
first
time
ive
ever
poured
this
into
a
glass
rather
than
drinking
it
in
the
bottle
with
a
slice
of
lime
very
pale
golden
hue
with
a
very
small
fizzy
white
head
that
vanishes
almost
immediately
held
up
the
glass
and
hey
i
can
watch
tv
right
through
it
aroma
of
adjunct
malt
astringency
and
some
skunkiness
light
but
not
delicate
taste
of
cheap
adjunct
malt
and
just
a
whiff
of
generic
hops
slightly
foamy
mouthfeel
by
almost
any
measure
pretty
bad
but
you
know
what
i
can
drink
this
all
day
especially
in
vegas
or
at
the
beach
where
there
are
few
alternatives
pours
a
pale
straw
with
a
fizzy
shortlived
head
with
pathetic
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
corn
and
malt
with
no
hops
the
taste
is
of
sweetish
plasticy
malts
with
some
dms
the
finish
is
watery
with
a
matallic
zing
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
this
is
one
bland
watery
beer
its
not
even
worth
trying
what
a
waste
of
time
drinkability
actually
relatively
high
compared
to
other
scores
this
muust
be
my
fond
all
in
all
nothing
terrific
but
a
nice
beer
to
relax
with
every
so
often
during
the
summer
overalli
wont
slam
corona
without
explanation
as
many
others
do
but
i
must
admit
that
i
am
shocked
many
uninformed
people
consider
this
a
topquality
beer
the
sour
mouthfeel
could
make
you
gag
the
lack
of
any
head
ruins
its
fine
color
and
it
isnt
at
all
refreshing
if
not
drank
ice
cold
in
my
book
this
is
a
substandard
beer
overall
not
at
all
worth
the
price
tag
any
beer
that
needs
an
outside
influence
a
lime
in
this
case
to
taste
good
should
immediately
be
considered
a
tasting
hazard
surprisingly
this
beer
pours
a
decentsized
head
i
wasnt
expecting
that
since
if
i
have
to
drink
this
stuff
i
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
i
dont
like
to
think
much
about
the
color
of
this
beer
since
it
reminds
me
of
urine
the
smell
is
really
not
very
appetizing
im
not
sure
how
to
describe
it
but
its
not
pleasant
this
beer
really
doesnt
like
much
of
anything
but
it
is
often
fairly
skunky
it
really
tastes
much
better
with
a
lime
in
it
as
for
mouthfeel
its
lightbodied
but
leaves
a
bad
aftertaste
its
actually
pretty
drinkable
unless
you
prefer
beer
that
actually
tastes
like
something
the
main
thing
i
dislike
about
this
beer
is
how
expensive
it
is
yet
its
not
exactly
something
of
great
quality
had
this
beer
this
summer
at
a
graduation
party
from
the
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
didnt
last1st
one
no
lime
little
aroma
and
flavor
2nd
one
with
lime
there
is
the
flavor
to
bad
it
was
lime
another
one
to
drink
ice
cold
and
fast
drinkability
imo
very
low
get
something
else
my
friend
and
i
did
get
a
few
chuckles
as
we
thought
of
the
movie
fast
and
the
furious
where
vin
diesel
tells
paul
walkers
character
you
can
have
any
beer
you
want
as
long
as
its
a
corona
we
both
agreed
if
we
were
in
that
position
the
movie
would
be
over
i
would
never
go
out
and
buy
a
corona
i
am
only
reviewing
it
since
a
sixpack
was
left
in
my
fridge
by
a
friend
if
you
must
drink
one
do
so
very
quicky
at
the
coldest
temperature
possible
just
to
move
on
to
something
anything
better
perhaps
the
most
successful
advertisingmarketing
scam
of
all
time
bud
never
looked
so
good
consumed
in
september
2004
from
a
12oz
bottle
well
im
sorry
to
disappoint
everyone
but
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
but
it
only
serves
one
purpose
when
you
are
dying
of
thirst
on
a
beach
this
is
a
good
one
to
grab
its
not
a
pretty
pour
it
doesnt
smell
like
anything
special
but
its
a
decent
beer
when
you
want
a
quick
one
and
there
isnt
anything
else
around
but
budmillercoors
at
least
this
one
has
a
bit
more
taste
dont
understand
why
its
so
expensive
though
i
always
have
a
12pk
on
hand
for
when
i
am
moving
the
lawn
of
doing
something
outside
my
only
question
is
will
i
get
scurvy
now
that
ive
had
a
corona
without
a
lime
as
often
as
you
see
people
ordering
this
in
bars
youd
think
it
might
be
half
decent
its
actually
pretty
atrocious
no
wonder
they
put
the
lime
in
it
everything
about
this
beer
is
unimpressive
yet
oddly
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
i
was
offered
one
why
is
this
so
popular
what
can
i
say
that
other
reviewers
havent
already
said
basically
corona
extra
is
the
mexican
equivalent
of
crudweiser
perhaps
a
bit
better
but
not
much
it
has
a
tendency
to
go
skunky
perhaps
cause
its
shipped
in
those
clear
bottles
that
offer
no
protection
against
harmful
uv
rays
or
whatever
it
is
that
ruins
beer
ill
have
to
concur
with
the
avoid
rating
on
this
one
although
i
think
that
grupo
modelos
dark
beer
negra
modelo
is
quite
good
if
youre
in
an
establishment
that
serves
grupo
modelo
products
go
for
the
negra
instead
i
truly
believe
that
every
time
someone
purchases
this
product
they
are
buying
status
chic
and
the
only
way
you
can
like
this
beer
is
through
systematic
desensitisation
put
the
corona
down
and
step
away
from
the
suckiness
these
numbers
would
be
lower
if
no
lime
were
added
1
5s
at
the
most
however
with
a
lime
dont
drink
it
without
the
lime
im
begging
you
it
works
to
quench
your
thirst
with
some
decent
beer
taste
the
color
is
unappealing
yellow
the
head
quickly
disappears
if
you
pour
it
and
it
tastes
a
bit
like
beer
i
usually
dont
want
more
than
one
corona
extra
is
nothing
special
but
not
horrible
either
it
is
a
light
gold
color
smell
is
certainly
adjuncty
as
is
the
taste
which
is
rather
watery
this
is
the
type
of
beer
which
is
best
enjoyed
straight
out
of
the
bottle
and
only
when
all
other
options
have
proven
elusive
yes
i
really
love
this
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
prefer
it
with
out
the
lime
there
is
no
other
beer
i
can
sit
around
and
drink
like
water
i
know
this
is
a
below
average
beer
and
many
like
to
slam
it
due
to
the
fact
its
cool
to
drink
but
in
actuallity
there
isnt
another
beer
that
goes
down
so
easily
on
a
hot
day
the
smell
is
aweful
but
the
taste
isnt
poor
i
just
wish
the
price
reflected
the
taste
because
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
i
only
drink
this
now
if
someone
offers
me
one
or
if
we
are
getting
tanked
on
the
golf
course
durring
may
5th
well
its
been
just
a
month
shy
of
4
years
since
ive
had
a
corona
and
now
i
remember
why
the
beer
sleazes
from
the
12ounce
clear
bottle
a
limpid
light
gold
color
with
the
head
small
and
white
frothy
in
texture
and
the
lace
thin
nose
is
dominated
by
the
malt
sweet
as
is
the
start
top
is
ultra
thin
finish
is
mildly
acidic
the
hops
sparse
and
the
aftertaste
dry
the
reason
even
after
4
years
was
the
fact
i
was
helping
someone
move
and
the
only
beer
he
had
was
a
six
pack
of
corona
must
admit
it
did
fend
off
the
heat
stroke
i
was
getting
from
moving
several
million
tones
of
stuff
up
a
flight
and
half
of
stairs
in
112
degree
heat
this
is
a
beer
that
if
offered
free
i
would
drink
but
if
i
have
to
pay
now
way
it
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
slight
head
that
fades
very
quickly
the
nose
is
of
grain
and
a
little
malt
the
flavor
is
quite
unobtrusive
with
a
slight
malt
background
and
a
crisp
bite
but
nothing
exciting
whatsoever
a
drinkable
beer
that
could
definantly
use
a
lime
to
help
out
with
the
flavor
obviously
corona
is
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
or
even
close
to
it
but
i
dont
quite
understand
all
the
coronabashing
from
reviewers
just
because
something
is
popular
doesnt
mean
it
isnt
actually
decent
satisfactory
if
cold
on
a
hot
day
some
foam
otherwise
yellow
nothing
special
maltcorn
sweetener
carbonation
whallop
on
the
aggressive
side
just
mediocre
ok
with
food
like
veggies
or
spicy
mexican
somewhat
astringent
aftertaste
slightly
better
than
most
other
macros
pale
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
i
get
the
normal
marco
lager
smell
which
is
usually
not
offensive
this
is
the
tastelessness
is
accompanied
by
an
off
flavor
more
or
different
adjuncts
than
im
used
to
this
odd
flavor
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
bought
a
24
ounce
bottle
for
2
50
pours
a
fizzy
light
yellow
very
little
head
nose
is
skunky
body
is
actually
a
little
fuller
than
i
expected
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
a
little
skunkiness
on
the
taste
but
not
bad
in
that
regard
some
cooked
vegy
notes
on
the
tastes
corny
sweetness
nothing
real
appealing
to
this
but
its
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
ill
never
pay
premium
for
this
but
i
could
see
a
few
of
these
sliding
down
ok
on
the
beach
errrr
for
9
bucks
a
case
or
something
a
below
average
but
not
horrible
beer
that
is
tremendously
overpriced
and
hyped
i
like
carta
blanca
tecate
dos
equis
and
a
few
others
better
than
this
but
id
drink
it
if
offered
it
for
free
i
wouldnt
order
it
though
i
was
really
expecting
this
to
be
a
horrible
beer
based
on
other
reviews
and
the
opinions
of
most
on
this
site
actually
extra
wasnt
too
bad
for
me
just
mediocre
the
appearance
isnt
too
bad
better
than
some
similiar
macros
but
still
not
too
impressive
smell
was
a
little
skanky
but
not
overly
bothersome
taste
was
fairly
smooth
not
complex
but
not
bad
i
wouldnt
praise
the
beer
for
its
taste
but
it
compared
decently
to
american
macros
the
most
positive
thing
i
have
to
say
about
extra
is
that
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
that
i
could
easily
session
it
overall
corona
extra
is
mediocre
i
think
it
would
work
good
as
a
thirst
quencher
type
beer
also
a
lime
spruced
up
the
flavor
a
little
bit
extra
horrible
granted
this
was
given
to
me
at
a
picnic
i
dont
know
if
i
could
do
worse
next
time
poured
out
a
piss
yellow
with
some
carbonation
visible
smell
was
not
there
there
was
nothing
to
smell
at
taste
was
nada
as
well
was
that
a
hop
bite
perhaps
not
must
of
been
the
water
that
they
use
heck
people
say
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
could
do
well
sometimes
no
way
give
me
a
cold
bottle
of
water
instead
this
is
as
low
as
it
gets
folks
avoid
this
by
all
costs
ill
grab
a
soda
next
time
instead
of
this
stuff
i
know
that
im
supposed
to
hate
this
beer
but
being
in
the
wasteland
of
beer
at
the
jersey
shore
left
me
little
choice
but
to
try
a
few
i
can
stand
this
beer
it
is
not
impressive
appearing
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
the
taste
is
just
passable
but
it
is
refreshing
since
the
beers
not
that
great
i
push
the
lime
into
it
and
it
is
like
a
limeade
i
wouldnt
make
a
steady
diet
of
this
but
it
is
okay
on
a
hot
summer
day
especially
when
the
alternative
is
bud
and
bud
lite
one
of
the
few
beers
where
the
light
version
is
actually
better
than
the
regular
because
the
taste
is
even
less
every
time
i
drink
this
stuff
i
swear
it
will
be
the
last
time
to
say
it
is
bad
is
an
understatement
this
beer
tastes
like
watered
down
urine
with
no
disrespect
to
mexico
they
say
dont
drink
the
water
there
this
beer
is
brewed
there
do
you
think
they
import
bottled
water
to
brew
the
alcohol
content
is
the
only
think
keeping
people
from
dying
from
food
poisoning
considering
the
price
its
probably
good
that
frat
boys
are
using
their
parents
money
to
buy
this
stuff
as
otherwise
it
would
not
sell
i
ended
up
at
a
cookout
this
evening
and
there
was
nothing
available
to
drink
other
than
four
kinds
of
macroswill
corona
being
one
of
the
imported
varieties
along
with
kronenbourg
1664
the
domestic
swills
included
budweiser
and
yuengling
light
instead
of
leaving
and
embarrasing
my
family
i
took
this
as
an
opportunity
to
try
beers
i
had
not
had
in
over
two
years
i
wish
i
had
just
left
the
corona
poured
a
distinctly
mellow
yellow
that
was
the
best
of
it
the
smell
and
taste
were
weakthe
most
distinctive
part
of
it
was
the
bubbles
there
were
no
hops
that
i
could
detect
not
worth
the
time
and
effort
i
poured
most
of
it
out
well
i
must
say
that
this
brew
is
not
very
tasty
never
has
been
have
experienced
it
with
and
with
out
lime
and
unfortunately
i
must
say
that
the
lime
does
help
it
out
a
bit
the
brew
pours
to
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
is
very
bubbly
and
has
no
real
retention
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
boring
and
heading
on
nasty
without
the
lime
somewhat
skunky
smells
seem
to
dominate
others
going
on
as
well
but
not
overly
that
pleasant
the
taste
is
of
corn
and
a
sweetness
that
overall
is
not
that
great
along
with
a
little
hop
not
a
very
good
beer
by
it
self
now
with
me
bad
mouthing
is
so
much
i
must
say
that
i
do
not
mind
it
when
i
have
a
lime
wedge
or
two
in
the
bottle
and
it
is
about
90
out
had
a
few
while
down
in
progreso
mexico
on
the
beach
and
i
am
not
sure
if
it
was
the
sun
ocean
relaxing
or
a
combination
of
all
but
i
actually
enjoyed
it
now
i
would
be
very
hard
pressed
to
have
the
same
experience
here
in
ny
light
yellow
and
clear
bottle
clear
with
engraved
label
mexican
symbols
and
stuff
corn
in
the
nose
medium
bubble
head
which
fades
quickly
minimal
flavor
no
hops
noticable
we
all
have
tried
and
probably
had
our
thirsts
quenched
by
this
stuff
its
better
then
budmillerfosters
etc
crisp
and
refreshing
good
on
the
beach
or
on
a
very
warm
day
it
is
a
bit
more
golden
than
many
macros
but
it
is
thin
sourish
and
gives
little
hint
that
its
based
on
barley
hah
and
hops
however
its
not
as
corny
as
some
other
macros
which
would
probably
benefit
it
anyway
i
didnt
even
finish
my
bottle
of
this
choosing
a
ginger
ale
instead
i
dont
care
where
under
what
situation
how
cold
or
how
cheap
this
is
not
worth
your
time
or
effort
to
even
drink
drinkability
only
if
youre
looking
to
improve
the
appearance
of
your
blind
date
after
5
of
them
you
may
not
notice
anymore
either
the
flavor
or
your
dates
ugliness
clear
gold
color
tiny
white
head
olores
del
maíz
y
de
la
mofeta
smells
of
corn
and
skunk
i
drank
it
from
a
mug
no
fruit
a
light
malty
flavor
which
is
overshadowed
by
the
large
amounts
of
skunk
this
was
packaged
in
a
beers
of
summer
sampler
between
an
oberon
and
a
curve
ball
a
very
overrated
beer
with
pretty
much
no
conceivable
positives
i
can
think
of
let
me
go
on
the
record
as
saying
that
my
preference
in
beer
is
highly
influenced
by
context
i
love
chimay
and
other
belgian
dark
beers
but
if
i
were
on
a
beach
or
at
the
pool
that
would
be
the
last
beer
i
would
ever
consider
drinking
in
that
atmosphere
pairing
beer
with
context
is
like
pairing
wine
with
food
if
you
have
a
mismatch
like
a
light
white
wine
with
beef
it
is
a
disaster
that
being
said
i
like
corona
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
when
i
am
at
the
beach
granted
a
lime
is
necessary
hence
the
1
5
smell
factor
but
this
beer
tastes
like
vacation
and
it
is
very
drinkable
limes
do
prevent
scurry
too
ask
the
pirates
so
i
am
giving
this
beer
a
higher
rating
than
many
of
you
have
viva
summertime
viva
corona
drinkable
it
is
in
a
flavorless
chugable
way
i
can
find
67
better
beers
in
mexico
without
really
trying
like
its
been
stated
so
many
times
before
this
before
should
probbaly
only
be
used
as
a
subbstitute
for
water
on
hot
summer
days
it
is
a
light
yellow
color
and
smells
skunky
it
taste
is
watery
overall
with
a
very
light
feel
on
the
tongue
and
some
hints
of
sourness
even
with
out
the
lime
corona
extra
is
awful
for
a
couple
of
reasons
it
is
7
to
8
bucks
for
a
six
pack
that
is
rediculous
for
a
crappy
beer
i
cant
believe
this
beer
does
so
well
it
almost
needs
two
categories
with
lime
and
without
it
no
beer
should
need
a
lime
to
make
better
this
beer
however
does
this
review
is
based
on
no
lime
corona
pours
a
light
yellow
with
no
head
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
skunky
and
the
taste
is
watery
and
flat
hints
of
sourness
as
well
feels
flat
and
dull
and
light
in
the
mouth
the
drinkability
is
a
2
here
because
on
a
hot
day
with
lime
you
can
pound
these
with
a
lime
the
drink
may
be
a
3
only
time
you
should
be
drinking
this
on
a
hot
beach
in
mexico
even
then
casta
would
be
better
i
never
put
anything
in
my
beer
such
as
fruit
or
fruit
juice
but
might
make
an
exception
if
corona
extra
was
the
only
thing
available
equal
parts
beer
and
lime
juice
might
make
it
palatable
or
not
an
ok
bar
drinkinoffensive
however
when
there
are
many
substitutes
from
europe
which
beat
it
hands
down
it
doesnt
stand
a
chance
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
since
some
of
my
friends
said
it
was
good
but
now
its
my
list
of
those
to
avoid
the
head
comes
and
goes
very
quickly
and
the
smell
is
that
of
a
skunk
that
reminds
me
of
driving
on
the
highway
the
taste
was
skunky
and
watery
as
well
i
tried
it
with
a
lime
and
found
it
bearable
after
i
had
already
had
a
significant
amount
to
drink
and
the
beer
simply
tasted
watery
at
that
point
the
finish
was
slightly
dry
with
no
sweetness
over
all
a
meek
watery
beer
to
quench
ones
thirst
another
nostalgic
beer
that
survives
on
an
exotic
image
f
there
really
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
beer
the
color
is
yellow
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
not
very
strong
couldnt
really
detect
hops
maybe
a
little
malt
smell
to
it
the
taste
was
very
plain
as
well
with
no
mouthfeel
was
like
drinking
water
on
the
drinkability
aspect
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
since
it
is
like
water
there
are
so
many
better
but
many
worse
too
whilst
out
gambling
at
the
suncoast
today
the
cocktail
waitress
brought
me
one
of
these
bad
boys
pale
yellow
with
a
lime
shoved
down
the
neck
smells
a
lil
funky
and
basically
like
a
lame
beer
taste
whats
up
corn
flakes
watered
down
corny
but
yet
i
found
it
drinkable
thin
in
the
mouth
maybe
it
was
the
fact
i
was
losing
at
blackjack
and
it
made
me
feel
better
but
this
wasnt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
ok
look
you
can
truly
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
especially
on
a
damned
hot
day
with
a
wedge
of
lime
floating
in
the
ice
cold
bottle
and
i
guess
on
some
level
there
are
days
i
might
actually
enjoy
the
feeling
of
sucking
down
a
citrus
flavored
alcoholic
beverage
labeled
as
beer
but
man
i
just
cant
be
as
gracious
as
to
give
this
beer
anything
more
than
it
deserves
which
is
a
rating
of
submediocre
because
where
i
come
from
flavor
actually
counts
for
something
and
im
not
talking
about
the
slug
of
fruit
im
jamming
down
the
neck
of
the
bottle
pours
a
clear
greenish
yello
under
a
thin
white
head
with
no
retention
to
speak
of
and
no
body
the
nose
reminds
me
of
sour
cabbage
the
mouth
is
very
light
and
prickly
the
taste
is
hard
to
figure
because
the
carbonation
dominates
everything
there
really
isnt
much
up
front
not
even
corn
the
finish
has
a
surprisingly
good
crisp
hoppy
bite
but
mild
is
the
operative
word
here
there
is
basically
no
aftertaste
ive
had
a
lot
of
more
vile
soviet
beers
but
ultimately
this
brew
deserves
its
bad
rep
redeeming
qualities
were
the
appearance
and
mouthful
both
more
substantial
than
expected
but
when
it
comes
right
down
to
it
if
beer
looks
good
but
does
not
taste
good
well
then
hang
it
on
the
wall
and
call
it
art
but
do
not
expect
me
to
allow
it
into
my
body
never
again
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
impression
as
it
is
just
another
average
pale
lager
on
a
positive
note
the
bottle
was
not
skunked
as
ive
been
warned
about
bottle
this
one
needs
to
be
drink
on
the
beach
during
hot
summer
days
with
lime
i
see
no
other
purpose
or
reason
to
drink
this
also
ensure
it
is
fresh
because
the
skunky
taste
will
overpower
everything
else
about
this
beer
i
guess
this
might
be
a
result
of
using
a
clear
bottle
well
served
at
a
bar
so
it
may
have
been
kept
in
a
carton
and
not
lightstruck
since
its
not
as
sucky
as
id
expect
it
is
just
a
little
bit
maltier
than
most
american
megabrews
so
ill
at
least
rate
it
a
little
above
the
average
swill
as
you
might
guess
the
was
the
most
exotic
import
the
bar
had
pale
yellow
with
quickly
vanishing
head
this
had
no
aroma
flavor
was
thin
light
and
watery
i
believe
this
beer
wanted
to
be
skunked
but
lacked
enough
hops
to
really
do
so
in
its
defense
there
were
no
off
flavors
but
there
were
no
on
flavors
either
slightly
sweet
malt
a
metallic
twang
in
the
finish
and
mucho
water
thank
god
i
didnt
pay
for
this
theres
no
way
it
should
cost
more
than
the
most
humble
strohs
or
genny
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
spotty
lace
head
the
smell
is
weak
but
pleasant
there
is
a
faint
odor
of
pale
malts
the
taste
is
watery
and
ordinary
it
has
that
mexican
beer
taste
to
it
im
not
exactly
sure
how
thats
acheived
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
just
not
too
enjoyable
as
far
as
commercial
imports
are
concerned
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
its
hard
to
beleive
thatfor
a
while
this
was
my
favorite
beer
when
i
first
moved
to
florida
it
is
clearly
all
image
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
my
first
mistake
very
weak
appearance
grainy
cornlike
aroma
tastewise
nothing
not
bad
just
nothing
refreshing
maybe
if
on
the
beach
with
a
lime
otherwise
worse
than
the
big
three
no
redeeming
qualities
at
all
this
beer
must
be
evaluated
for
what
it
sets
out
to
be
a
refreshing
hot
weather
thirst
quencher
that
said
lets
start
with
the
aroma
corny
yes
skunky
no
this
smell
i
find
to
be
one
of
the
charming
things
about
this
beer
and
i
never
drink
it
with
a
lime
the
carbonation
level
is
appropriate
for
a
easy
drinking
lager
and
drinkability
is
this
beers
strongest
point
smooth
mouthfeel
i
believe
that
some
of
the
unique
aromas
and
flavors
that
emanate
from
this
brew
are
due
to
adjuncts
namely
corn
but
i
have
always
found
them
pleasant
and
what
gives
corona
its
appeal
ive
been
drinking
it
it
for
about
30
years
way
before
the
yuppies
discovered
it
and
started
shoving
limes
down
its
throat
my
advice
dont
be
bullied
by
the
ale
snobs
into
calling
every
yellow
beer
flavorless
enjoy
sublety
and
loosen
up
a
little
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
in
creation
if
this
was
the
bottle
version
i
would
have
given
it
an
even
worse
review
correction
of
beer
name
in
october
2003
i
incorrectly
reviewed
corona
light
as
corona
extra
i
have
since
tried
corona
extra
transplanted
the
previous
review
to
its
proper
place
and
edited
this
review
to
cover
the
correct
beer
overall
i
dont
know
which
is
worse
that
this
is
actually
considered
good
beer
by
the
majority
in
his
country
or
that
there
is
actually
a
corona
light
it
is
a
fun
summer
beer
but
nothing
to
speak
of
cotnained
within
if
you
have
to
put
a
lime
in
it
to
taste
good
it
has
to
be
bad
i
had
two
of
these
one
with
a
lime
and
one
without
first
thing
is
first
beer
should
never
come
in
a
clear
bottle
someone
should
tell
the
fine
folks
at
corona
this
the
color
of
the
beer
was
kind
if
a
neon
yellow
with
no
head
off
to
a
bad
start
the
smell
was
that
of
rice
and
bad
skunk
which
is
what
i
also
got
from
the
taste
i
put
in
a
couple
lime
wedges
and
they
did
little
to
mask
the
flavor
ok
it
did
look
cool
when
the
lime
was
dropped
in
it
fizzed
im
sorry
mexico
your
1
beer
failed
poured
light
yellow
with
little
head
retention
ricey
small
hoppy
aroma
very
little
hoppy
taste
just
a
thirst
quencher
seems
to
go
ok
when
your
in
a
mexican
establishment
and
your
trying
to
cleanse
your
mouth
for
a
new
taste
really
not
worthy
of
sipping
by
itself
elsewhere
i
have
stated
that
many
mexican
beers
have
the
same
problem
that
i
can
describe
in
two
words
skunky
sulfurous
fumes
emanate
from
the
bottle
upon
opening
ye
gods
open
a
window
if
you
can
somehow
get
past
the
initial
bouquet
the
beer
isnt
too
bad
i
prefer
carta
blanca
or
dos
equis
or
sol
the
only
time
i
would
venture
here
is
on
a
very
hot
day
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
the
fridge
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
undercarbonated
the
finish
is
a
rather
poor
attempt
at
sweetness
unimpressive
aftertaste
try
a
different
beer
i
have
had
a
number
of
these
beers
in
my
less
informed
days
yet
i
have
never
had
one
in
a
glass
i
have
had
them
in
the
bottle
with
a
lime
and
even
in
a
can
with
a
lime
it
is
a
light
golden
color
with
little
aroma
its
nothing
really
special
tasting
either
like
most
mass
produced
beers
but
im
here
to
say
that
given
the
right
situation
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
going
out
to
a
mexican
restaurant
to
eat
you
almost
have
to
have
a
corona
or
on
the
beach
a
corona
is
not
a
bad
choice
but
other
then
a
few
situations
i
would
suggest
to
pass
must
have
a
lime
to
drink
it
do
not
attempt
it
with
out
the
lime
was
at
a
friends
party
and
his
wife
chose
a
fiesta
theme
guess
what
beer
they
had
corona
or
corona
light
it
had
been
a
while
so
i
figured
before
i
left
to
buy
the
host
some
decent
beer
id
give
it
a
go
well
one
can
clearly
see
the
colour
is
a
very
pale
yellow
aromas
were
chemical
and
astringent
mouthfeel
was
brutal
due
to
the
carbonation
and
over
all
taste
the
taste
was
not
that
of
beer
but
of
a
sweetish
water
with
a
metallic
bitter
aftertaste
i
tried
this
with
out
the
lime
but
the
lime
might
help
a
litte
to
give
it
some
sort
of
flavour
drinkability
is
low
i
would
have
to
be
very
drunk
to
drink
one
of
these
again
drinkability
i
hate
this
category
it
implies
this
beers
drinkable
it
isnt
screw
the
lime
this
stuff
sucks
finishing
the
pint
i
bought
is
going
to
be
a
chore
this
beer
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
wouldnt
that
cause
it
to
become
skunky
if
exposed
to
sunlight
it
is
a
simple
yellow
beer
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
nothing
special
smells
like
any
other
mass
produced
beer
on
the
market
the
taste
is
acceptable
with
a
lemon
slice
in
it
slightly
better
than
most
other
middleamerican
beers
ive
had
but
still
not
anywhere
near
the
top
of
my
list
comments

not
much
positive
to
write
about
on
this
one
sorry
but
it
just
wasnt
very
good
i
saw
that
some
karma
midgets
fived
it
but
only
three
mugged
bas
gave
it
a
three
or
higher
this
one
is
not
on
my
christmas
list
i
guess
its
pretty
much
adios
now
corona
ill
stick
to
beer
a
friend
of
mine
recently
had
a
birthday
party
and
free
coronas
were
offered
so
i
decided
to
have
one
without
the
lime
none
were
offered
everyone
knows
how
not
good
it
is
so
i
wont
waste
our
time
by
repeating
it
lets
focus
on
the
positives
it
isnt
corona
light
um
thats
it
well
its
better
than
coors
or
buttwiper
thats
the
only
positive
it
has
no
aroma
nor
flavor
in
fact
you
have
to
put
the
lime
in
to
make
it
drinkable
oh
christ
why
did
they
offer
me
this
corona
comes
in
clear
bottles
so
you
can
see
the
light
colour
of
the
brew
and
possibly
get
that
skunked
smell
and
taste
pours
a
very
pale
pale
yellow
and
gold
colour
that
you
can
see
through
like
a
pair
of
contact
lenses
no
head
whatsoever
add
a
little
salt
you
barely
get
a
bubble
smelled
skunky
every
corona
ive
had
which
isnt
very
many
had
this
skunked
smell
it
is
so
overpowering
that
any
malt
or
hop
scent
is
undetectable
sour
tasting
add
a
lime
and
its
barely
tolerable
mostly
because
you
can
taste
the
lime
the
aftertaste
is
a
sourbitter
combination
perhaps
some
evidence
of
hops
sorry
not
enough
thin
light
watery
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
at
all
one
of
the
biggest
overhyped
and
worst
beers
one
can
get
light
gold
color
small
head
light
tasting
lager
style
beer
light
bodied
and
moderately
hoppy
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
a
little
yeasty
finish
is
crisp
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
trendy
swill
best
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
i
always
have
a
fit
when
i
see
this
beer
for
7
or
8
buck
a
six
pack
in
some
places
i
remember
when
i
could
by
this
stuff
for
25
cents
a
sixer
in
baja
notes
we
all
know
this
beers
worthless
and
overhyped
ripping
it
would
be
a
waste
of
my
time
the
best
choice
i
had
out
of
a
fridge
full
of
bad
brews
is
this
exact
same
brew
as
corona
light
just
in
a
slightly
different
bottle
methinks
so
looks
the
same
smells
the
same
tastes
the
same
looks
like
piss
tastes
like
water
no
characteristics
whatsoever
add
a
lime
and
create
lime
water
should
you
desire
i
certainly
didnt
i
hate
when
people
drink
this
stuff
and
think
theyre
enjoying
a
quality
brew
that
is
all
i
drink
this
beer
for
the
image
alone
and
think
you
should
to
mass
produced
from
mexico
light
yellow
color
with
little
flavor
if
any
its
on
the
bitter
end
flat
low
carboantion
with
no
lasting
belgian
lace
is
not
very
drinkable
either
with
lime
or
without
it
mouthfeel
is
light
and
no
body
with
not
much
substance
smell
is
weak
and
non
impressive
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
small
to
large
sized
white
bubbles
that
left
very
little
lacing
it
has
a
wheat
yellow
body
with
a
mild
if
any
aroma
it
has
an
initial
bite
that
lingers
slightly
into
the
aftertaste
it
has
a
mild
hoppy
malt
flavor
this
review
covers
corona
with
the
requisite
lime
and
salt
it
pours
a
rather
plain
yellow
and
the
smell
is
quite
average
as
well
the
taste
a
pleasent
bitter
and
salty
combination
which
occurs
for
obvious
reasons
is
fantastic
however
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
satisfying
not
a
bad
beer
in
all
but
there
exist
better
while
my
wife
will
strongly
disagree
with
this
review
why
almost
all
chicks
love
this
swill
is
beyond
comprehension
i
have
to
be
honest
and
say
this
is
one
of
the
worlds
worst
beers
i
guess
if
your
idea
of
beer
is
a
brew
almost
devoid
of
taste
and
what
taste
there
is
reminds
you
of
cardboard
or
rotting
wood
smell
a
nasty
metallic
bitter
aftertaste
watery
as
hell
body
and
even
paler
looking
in
color
then
go
buy
yourself
a
case
of
this
swill
er
beer
good
luck
to
you
rating
listen
to
the
warning
bells
going
off
in
your
head
whenever
someone
tries
to
squeeze
a
lemon
or
lime
wedge
into
your
bottle
its
either
flavorless
or
disgusting
this
pale
yellow
swill
with
the
fast
fading
white
head
lager
holds
a
light
pasty
malt
almost
flavorless
light
hops
and
a
sweet
wet
corncob
aroma
and
taste
this
beer
is
not
disgusting
with
the
lime
added
it
is
however
a
poor
excuse
for
a
beer
odd
how
so
many
fall
for
marketing
over
substance
tonight
is
my
light
night
at
the
flying
saucer
after
a
coors
light
i
had
a
corona
extra
it
poured
a
clear
yellow
but
was
relatively
flat
no
head
it
had
no
aroma
which
could
be
good
since
it
was
not
skunked
in
that
clear
bottle
the
flavor
was
equally
bland
the
mouthfeel
was
similar
to
water
one
of
the
folks
at
the
table
said
that
corona
makes
a
great
pool
beer
well
i
was
not
at
the
pool
so
i
found
it
less
than
desirable
it
was
not
horrible
but
not
even
good
all
of
us
have
been
at
a
swanky
party
or
mexican
restaurant
that
have
pushed
us
to
try
a
corona
with
a
lime
lemon
or
shot
of
tequila
while
i
cant
speak
for
everyone
this
is
one
beer
that
i
wish
that
i
had
not
tasted
first
off
it
is
beer
in
a
clear
bottle
which
leads
to
the
beer
becoming
a
skunk
beer
the
day
it
was
bottled
when
the
beer
is
opened
the
aroma
is
strong
and
smells
like
wet
paper
towels
that
have
been
sitting
in
the
sun
taste
was
lackluster
and
i
have
found
like
most
malt
liquors
it
was
drinkable
albeit
when
it
was
very
very
cold
if
someone
offers
you
a
bottle
of
this
brew
run
away
and
throw
the
lemon
or
lime
at
them
and
grab
the
shot
of
tequila
now
i
understand
that
this
board
is
full
of
people
that
strongly
believe
you
have
to
be
able
to
cut
your
beer
with
a
knofe
corona
isnt
a
bad
beer
especially
for
one
day
a
year
55
i
would
consider
it
the
best
of
the
shit
beers
and
i
wouldnt
be
ashamed
to
have
it
in
my
fridge
of
course
right
now
i
have
a
bent
tree
and
a
tripel
but
hey
it
could
happen
i
wish
there
were
negative
points
available
one
star
seems
too
charitable
theres
something
about
corona
that
makes
me
feel
dirty
when
i
drink
it
dont
ask
but
its
enough
to
prevent
my
from
buying
it
under
my
own
free
will
not
exactly
the
biggest
fan
of
corona
i
have
to
admit
i
like
drinking
it
in
the
summer
time
outside
maybe
when
at
a
jimmy
buffett
concert
or
something
like
that
otherwise
i
generally
dont
drinkt
his
stuff
unless
there
is
absolutely
nothing
else
around
not
recommended
the
addition
of
lime
masks
almost
all
the
foul
and
not
so
foul
qualities
of
this
beer
and
in
turn
make
it
taste
like
an
alcoholic
limeflavored
seltzer
water
can
be
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
especially
with
the
lime
i
would
still
recommend
this
over
some
really
foul
american
beers
that
ive
had
but
in
general
i
would
advise
beer
drinkers
to
steer
clear
remember
the
lime
was
originally
used
so
that
the
citric
acid
would
disinfect
the
top
i
may
love
jimmy
buffet
but
i
still
dont
want
to
drink
this
stuff
this
beer
poured
a
medium
head
that
left
a
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
mug
there
was
some
carbonation
to
this
beer
it
had
a
smooth
taste
to
it
i
did
not
notice
any
bitterness
or
any
aftertaste
with
this
beer
there
was
nothing
outstanding
about
this
beer
as
i
did
not
feel
that
it
had
any
character
to
it
i
definitely
will
not
be
drinking
this
beer
again
i
am
glad
i
have
this
rating
out
of
the
way
a
trademark
mexican
beer
with
not
much
to
be
proud
about
it
pours
yet
again
your
average
golden
tone
even
clearer
which
would
make
me
guess
it
was
rather
watery
especially
after
the
mild
foam
head
faded
quickly
and
guess
what
i
was
right
this
beer
has
no
smell
and
no
taste
at
all
it
is
the
worst
of
the
light
beers
you
can
throw
in
a
lemon
to
give
it
some
taste
but
you
can
also
do
that
for
a
more
cheaper
edition
of
water
and
have
some
lemonade
a
beer
that
actually
needs
help
on
the
taste
the
color
is
your
typical
horsewhiz
yellow
that
we
are
all
familiar
with
the
head
is
white
and
disappears
faster
than
it
took
me
to
type
this
sentence
the
smell
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
you
add
lime
to
it
it
becomes
the
predominant
aroma
instantly
the
taste
is
not
spectacular
full
of
adjuncts
very
grainy
in
nature
unless
youve
added
enough
lime
to
kill
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
but
thats
about
it
sure
you
could
drink
this
all
day
long
but
why
would
you
want
to
pours
a
light
yellow
there
was
a
head
but
quickly
faded
with
zero
lace
aroma
was
not
much
a
hint
of
malt
and
may
be
some
hops
the
taste
is
very
light
not
much
of
a
beer
flavor
to
it
it
is
a
bit
watered
down
if
flavor
sure
you
can
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
but
is
it
worth
it
is
this
the
yellow
fizzy
stuff
they
talk
about
on
the
bottle
of
arrogant
bastard
ale
good
summertime
drink
thats
all
it
has
to
be
ice
cold
and
with
a
lime
wedge
to
give
it
some
flavor
it
is
gold
in
color
and
clear
little
or
no
head
some
carbonation
and
easily
drinkable
the
only
time
youll
see
this
in
my
hand
is
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
while
in
mexico
during
spring
break
sampled
in
the
bottle
classic
style
with
a
thin
lime
wedge
the
corona
signature
initially
surprised
at
how
clear
in
color
this
beverage
is
smell
without
the
lime
is
very
skunky
with
the
lime
a
little
citrus
and
some
skunk
aroma
this
beer
has
tons
of
carbonation
and
the
taste
is
a
tad
of
corn
finishing
a
bit
watery
a
very
onesided
beer
for
the
price
in
most
markets
ive
been
in
this
goes
for
67
dollars
a
sixer
anyone
can
do
much
better
the
only
plus
is
these
are
awfully
smooth
and
just
a
touch
drinkable
on
a
hot
hot
day
light
yellow
pour
with
very
little
lasting
white
head
this
is
a
very
watery
beer
that
presents
little
to
like
or
dislike
the
sense
is
of
light
carbonation
with
very
little
smell
or
taste
some
light
citrus
sense
a
lightweight
beer
that
seems
overly
popular
for
what
it
is
which
below
average
in
every
category
why
waste
time
with
this
ive
had
it
both
mexico
and
us
and
it
makes
little
difference
its
bad
the
fact
that
its
over
priced
adds
to
the
poor
impression
best
thing
i
ever
did
with
the
brew
was
a
small
blind
taste
test
with
a
couple
of
friends
with
notoriously
long
neck
swilling
taste
and
it
was
soundly
beated
by
all
of
the
usual
mass
produced
lites
only
positive
note
is
the
lemon
that
adds
some
vitamins
otherwise
its
a
waste
of
calories
if
you
look
at
the
pilsner
standards
the
color
isnt
bad
but
under
achieves
on
aroma
mouth
and
finish
not
a
very
impressive
beer
standard
amber
color
with
a
flat
taste
not
much
better
than
american
massproduced
lagers
but
it
is
acceptable
at
the
shore
on
a
hot
day
with
a
lime
for
extra
flavor
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
you
can
do
much
better
for
the
price
drinkability
ok
in
a
pinch
i
give
it
an
extra
half
point
because
i
realize
this
beer
is
drinkable
icecold
on
a
hot
day
here
in
minnesota
corona
seems
like
an
exotic
import
beer
i
still
cannot
believe
a
brewer
would
have
the
guts
to
package
beer
in
clear
bottles
maybe
thats
why
i
wasnt
impressed
pours
with
little
fanfare
what
head
exists
is
very
dry
and
gone
quickly
smell
is
of
rotten
veggiesfruit
taste
is
well
bad
sickly
sweet
corn
abounds
no
hop
bitterness
the
beer
was
skunky
clear
bottles
i
really
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
fair
shake
i
do
not
recommend
this
a
hamms
or
schlitz
beer
is
cheaper
and
better
and
thats
not
saying
a
lot
well
i
was
once
told
that
this
beer
had
its
particular
time
and
place
i
am
guessing
that
this
person
is
referring
to
being
in
mexico
or
on
any
beach
partying
however
while
in
ensenada
this
summer
this
beer
was
no
where
to
be
seen
you
had
to
specially
ask
for
this
beer
and
it
wasnt
on
billboards
or
the
television
commercials
no
the
marketing
is
for
those
americans
just
show
them
the
picture
with
the
lime
wedged
in
the
bottle
then
well
see
some
response
from
them
yep
that
is
basically
what
happened
this
beer
became
popularized
with
commercials
not
with
a
good
taste
so
as
i
pour
this
beer
in
wv
during
early
january
i
almost
know
it
is
a
mistake
however
i
am
giving
it
a
shot
when
i
poured
this
golden
as
in
color
of
piss
it
fizzled
like
a
can
of
soda
and
the
head
was
gone
by
the
time
i
looked
at
the
screen
and
back
down
to
my
pint
glass
at
first
scent
it
seems
very
unpleasant
but
when
i
taste
it
this
beer
contains
relatively
no
flavors
it
does
have
a
mild
citrusy
sweetness
but
there
is
really
nothing
here
for
being
so
big
with
the
average
beer
drinker
i
wasnt
expecting
much
here
this
beer
is
not
one
that
i
plan
to
drink
ever
again
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
this
beer
and
this
is
not
one
of
them
no
taste
what
so
ever
comes
through
for
me
corn
and
maybe
rice
are
what
i
taste
and
smell
nothing
to
spectacular
and
nothing
that
i
would
strive
for
good
but
not
that
good
i
think
that
there
are
some
better
mexican
beers
out
there
hopefully
i
will
find
one
some
day
urine
yellow
in
color
head
disappears
in
no
time
this
one
has
a
slight
skunky
smell
that
i
cant
get
past
not
much
flavor
to
speak
of
maybe
thats
what
the
lime
is
for
it
does
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
but
it
doesnt
taste
good
doing
it
they
say
not
to
drink
the
water
in
mexico
thats
beers
1
ingredient
so
just
dont
drink
the
corona
this
brew
was
a
disappointment
very
light
offering
in
colour
body
and
taste
the
crown
is
nonexistant
and
has
the
mouthfeel
of
a
flat
ginger
ale
the
taste
is
however
fairly
well
balanced
but
a
little
dry
tastes
skunky
and
bitter
it
is
really
light
and
thin
not
much
to
it
except
for
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
lack
of
flavor
not
to
mention
that
the
flavor
that
is
there
is
just
not
good
at
all
i
heard
that
people
originally
used
limes
to
keep
the
flies
away
and
people
do
it
because
they
think
it
is
a
trendy
foreign
thing
to
do
whatever
the
case
may
be
that
little
lime
is
all
you
will
enjoy
with
this
beer
it
helps
when
i
tried
this
beer
for
the
first
time
i
wondered
if
this
was
beer
or
tequilla
awfull
taste
and
smell
an
important
characteristic
of
the
beer
is
the
appearance
and
i
rate
it
with
1
55
imagine
as
you
can
notice
this
beer
tasted
like
panther
piss
one
sip
and
i
mean
sip
and
this
is
the
third
time
in
my
life
that
i
poured
a
beer
down
the
drain
how
can
anyone
drink
this
garbage
beer
luck
has
it
i
didnt
buy
it
i
tasted
it
over
at
a
gathering
overall
not
a
bad
taste
and
texture
but
definitely
decline
if
no
lime
wedge
is
available
not
impossible
to
enjoy
texture
is
ok
another
great
choice
for
the
college
generation
and
financially
impaired
very
yellow
in
color
and
clear
any
head
quickly
reduced
to
a
ring
along
the
glass
this
beer
is
very
carbonated
but
i
guess
there
are
so
few
proteins
that
all
the
gas
just
goes
away
it
smelled
like
corn
sugar
and
vegetables
it
didnt
taste
too
much
different
it
had
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
grain
and
vegetables
and
a
touch
of
hops
all
of
these
flavors
were
bullied
around
by
the
intense
carbonation
though
not
a
particularly
good
beer
i
would
much
rather
have
a
negro
modelo
or
dos
equis
amber
if
i
had
to
go
for
a
south
of
the
border
lager
sweet
tart
briny
maltiness
on
the
nose
candied
apple
aloe
corn
husk
and
mineral
flavors
predominate
it
actually
doesnt
tasted
too
fed
with
its
like
they
set
out
to
make
a
cheap
beer
and
they
did
it
they
didnt
try
to
cover
their
tracks
with
chemistry
decent
balance
on
the
finish
whats
the
water
source
i
suspect
it
is
a
good
one
due
to
the
funny
looks
i
get
when
i
start
barking
out
big
beers
to
drink
when
i
visit
vegas
i
stick
with
corona
just
to
keep
things
simple
when
throwing
the
dice
anyway
i
decided
to
try
this
one
at
home
just
to
see
if
it
is
just
a
vegas
thing
for
me
well
the
color
is
nearly
identical
going
down
when
it
come
out
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
not
a
great
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
but
after
a
frustrating
day
at
work
and
the
unusal
sunny
skies
and
hot
weather
here
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
keep
from
getting
too
parched
dont
let
this
one
get
anywhere
close
to
getting
warm
though
drink
it
cold
and
drink
it
fast
not
such
a
great
beer
corona
extra
has
little
if
any
character
of
an
earth
shattering
beer
if
modelo
would
put
more
money
into
the
beer
instead
of
the
tv
ads
every
body
would
be
better
off
not
too
many
good
reviews
for
this
beer
in
fact
scathing
and
yet
the
numbers
are
ok
hmmm
obviously
its
not
about
the
beer
wheres
it
coming
from
the
painted
bottle
yes
people
love
it
the
image
of
a
relaxed
carefree
coastal
attitude
yes
trendiness
yes
marketing
yes
the
lime
can
we
forget
about
all
of
the
history
and
just
taste
the
beer
the
color
is
a
nice
yellow
gold
with
a
white
head
that
holds
up
ok
no
lace
theres
a
distinct
somewhat
unique
and
lightly
sweet
malty
aroma
with
maybe
a
touch
of
hop
lurking
in
the
background
nothing
really
off
the
bodys
mediumlight
with
a
fine
and
moderate
carbonation
level
the
flavor
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
suggests
but
rather
its
accompanied
by
a
dull
earthy
bitterness
the
finish
leaves
a
lingering
bitterness
and
some
light
maltiness
but
no
hop
flavor
but
then
again
there
are
no
offflavors
either
not
a
real
well
made
beer
but
not
horrid
by
any
stretch
now
i
have
something
to
add
to
the
history
when
this
beer
came
on
the
scene
miller
lite
was
still
big
dry
beers
had
just
passed
through
town
this
offered
something
more
without
being
hoppy
or
bitter
apart
from
all
the
marketing
people
liked
it
let
it
go
slightly
better
than
the
corona
light
the
darker
golden
color
hints
at
more
flavor
than
the
light
the
aroma
is
bitter
as
are
most
of
the
mexican
beers
the
flavor
is
bitter
also
but
at
least
it
exists
when
compared
to
the
light
lime
is
needed
for
this
beer
also
but
not
bad
with
mexican
food
however
when
eating
mexican
my
beer
of
choice
is
the
dos
equis
amber
much
more
flavor
extra
what
i
have
avoided
trying
this
based
on
wordofmouth
i
tried
someone
elses
and
quickly
figured
out
why
it
is
served
with
lime
the
lime
is
the
only
ingredient
that
gives
it
any
flavor
i
wouldnt
pay
money
for
this
dont
bother
with
this
one
it
is
not
even
refreshing
a
highly
underrated
summer
brew
light
and
refreshing
sans
lemon
or
lime
slice
the
aroma
is
nothing
to
write
home
to
mother
about
and
neither
is
the
flavor
however
the
drinkabillity
factor
is
there
in
the
summer
time
prost
the
only
way
this
beer
gets
even
and
average
taste
is
using
a
lime
smells
terrible
and
skunky
and
without
the
lime
i
will
not
drink
it
is
a
good
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
but
so
is
water
cheers
notes
this
is
the
1
imported
beer
in
the
us
though
there
are
numerous
others
southoftheborder
brews
that
are
worth
checking
out
as
for
the
lime
thing
you
wont
see
it
here
is
it
really
worth
the
2024
a
case
not
to
us
aside
from
being
slightly
lightstruck
no
apparent
aroma
little
head
and
no
distinct
malt
or
hop
attribute
crisp
finish
and
slightly
bitter
but
also
watery
better
than
budwieser
can
swill
many
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
watered
down
hop
flavor
makes
this
brew
easy
to
pound
definitely
a
chick
beer
this
is
typical
of
mexican
beers
they
are
meant
to
cut
the
dust
and
cool
you
down
you
wont
find
anyone
south
of
the
border
drinking
a
rogue
shakpespeare
stoudt
this
beer
is
light
in
color
taste
and
small
smell
is
somewhat
sour
and
ricey
almost
no
head
when
poured
can
get
skunky
easlity
because
of
the
clear
bottle
taste
is
light
and
watery
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
or
with
tacos
drinkability
is
high
because
it
goes
down
easily
alternately
try
a
negra
modelo
for
yuppies
and
girls
i
feel
so
dirty
admitting
this
but
i
dont
mind
corona
no
i
dont
drink
it
all
the
time
i
bet
i
drink
one
six
of
it
during
the
summer
its
the
situations
that
i
will
consume
of
these
i
e
while
bbqing
on
a
very
hot
day
or
after
a
softball
game
not
much
in
terms
of
taste
but
very
drinkable
in
terms
of
being
able
to
slap
em
down
without
thinking
no
it
wont
replace
a
good
ipa
or
even
a
poor
ipa
but
its
drinkable
im
going
back
in
the
closet
now
nice
color
and
head
but
after
that
you
might
as
well
as
stop
the
taste
is
very
very
bland
which
imakes
this
beer
good
when
eating
mexican
food
other
than
that
forget
it
there
are
so
many
better
brews
out
their
an
excited
champange
carbonation
level
pale
straw
yellow
a
spicey
clover
nose
and
a
sweet
clover
maltiness
on
the
tongue
texture
has
quite
the
bite
like
fizzy
soda
very
straightforward
very
simple
refreshing
really
nothing
to
look
at
in
a
glass
and
no
head
slight
skunk
and
grain
adjunct
aroma
watery
mouthfeel
and
the
weakest
hint
of
hops
tastes
like
nothing
i
cant
believe
they
make
a
light
version
of
this
i
do
understand
why
people
drink
this
with
a
lemon
or
lime
it
actually
improves
the
beer
this
is
worse
than
any
us
macroswill
no
two
ways
about
it
this
is
just
bad
beer
in
our
teens
we
used
to
drink
it
on
mexico
road
trips
because
it
was
about
25
cents
a
bottle
and
we
didnt
know
any
better
if
i
end
up
at
a
picnic
with
all
the
us
macrolagers
and
corona
as
my
only
choices
in
the
cooler
ill
pick
bud
miller
or
even
coors
over
the
corona
with
that
said
if
you
can
throw
the
first
one
down
without
barfing
they
get
a
little
easier
to
tolerate
if
you
want
to
drink
mexican
beer
almost
any
other
choice
is
better
and
no
more
expensive
although
it
at
times
resembles
urine
corona
is
quite
refreshing
provided
the
lime
is
in
there
to
mask
the
taste
there
isnt
much
to
the
appearance
and
it
goes
down
like
water
which
is
why
i
dont
mind
throwin
back
a
few
of
these
sometimes
gives
me
nice
memories
of
my
high
school
days
when
i
was
indifferent
to
crap
beer
such
as
this
looks
like
ginger
ale
no
smell
and
lots
of
big
bubbles
zero
head
and
zero
retention
watery
and
lacks
any
real
distinct
flavors
use
a
lime
if
there
is
any
around
because
it
needs
something
not
bad
tasting
just
boring
just
ok
nothing
special
but
not
undrinkable
in
fact
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
its
just
pretty
forgettable
but
it
is
pretty
easy
to
chug
see
my
review
for
corona
light
bigger
twitching
skunk
bigger
corn
patch
same
damned
clown
somebody
at
modelo
must
be
looking
at
the
sales
and
peeing
his
pants
laughing
i
try
and
i
try
but
other
than
a
vague
sweetness
and
carbonation
i
cant
taste
a
thing
given
the
media
buzz
on
this
tasteless
brew
im
still
waiting
for
the
fuss
to
die
down
not
much
taste
but
it
has
its
moments
on
hot
summer
days
a
bit
pricey
for
what
you
get
in
the
end
really
out
of
the
few
mexican
beers
that
i
have
tasted
i
can
probably
say
this
is
one
of
worst
pours
a
bright
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
a
faint
lace
on
the
nose
there
isnt
much
light
cooked
veggies
on
the
palate
the
flavors
of
husk
light
sweetness
slight
bitterness
fairly
clean
just
not
much
going
on
still
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
though
but
why
bother
ok
when
its
really
hot
out
and
youre
slaving
over
the
grill
cooking
up
some
fajitas
and
youre
wife
gives
you
one
of
these
really
cold
with
a
wedge
of
lime
to
mask
the
skunkiness
then
maybe
just
maybe
you
drink
it
that
is
unless
theres
something
better
in
your
fridge
do
you
believe
theres
a
light
version
of
this
this
is
already
light
tasteless
beer
to
call
this
chick
beer
2001
one
of
the
best
mexican
imports
i
have
tried
this
is
going
to
be
my
beer
for
the
summer
of
2015
o
not
a
great
beer
but
it
was
quite
refreshing
on
a
30
degree
mexican
cloudless
day
i
drank
this
coming
straight
off
a
negra
modelo
so
perhaps
my
rating
will
be
a
bit
skewed
i
actually
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
malty
kick
and
good
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
golden
color
sprouting
a
white
head
the
beer
looked
and
tasted
above
average
to
me
now
is
that
because
i
already
had
two
negra
modelos
before
i
tried
this
perhaps
but
as
of
now
im
giving
it
a
half
decent
rating
pretty
standard
aal
cardboard
and
malt
only
drinkable
extremely
cold
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
spice
mexican
food
also
doesnt
hurt
when
you
buy
a
case
of
these
for
under
15
just
another
light
beer
like
corona
maybe
alittle
better
good
beer
tastes
like
that
carribean
flavor
i
love
but
just
a
hint
bumps
up
a
grade
with
salt
refreshing
good
for
the
summer
and
good
with
fish
tacos
honestly
my
favorite
mexican
beer
right
next
to
victorias
it
tastes
like
a
mixture
of
horse
cum
and
gasoline
but
is
quite
earthy
no
floral
or
tropical
aromas
other
than
the
lime
that
instantaneously
went
rotten
the
moment
it
touched
the
beer
mexican
piss
water
would
be
an
upgrade
to
this
concoction
shame
on
myself
for
paying
actual
currency
for
this
quite
under
whelming
even
for
a
mexican
lager
to
use
the
words
of
a
certain
arrogant
bastard
its
just
fizzy
yellow
beer
drinkable
though
this
is
a
beer
i
drink
when
i
go
to
the
beach
and
i
want
something
else
than
water
a
fresh
lime
and
its
good
to
go
still
bad
but
better
than
water
my
favorite
beer
hands
down
for
summertime
drinking
can
put
down
a
lot
of
these
o
i
am
cooking
mexican
dishes
today
so
i
thought
i
would
try
an
unreviewed
by
me
mexican
lager
this
is
a
lot
better
than
corona
it
will
wash
down
the
spicy
food
nicely
pacifico
reminds
me
of
mexico
pacífico
brewed
by
grupo
modelo
s
a
de
c
v
with
an
abv
of
4
50
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
it
has
the
look
of
most
lager
brews
on
the
market
the
smell
is
skunky
with
grains
and
malts
you
pick
up
a
hit
of
hops
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
bold
with
flavor
you
pick
up
on
grains
malts
and
a
hit
of
hops
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
with
flavor
i
like
how
this
brew
goes
down
smooth
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
it
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
grupo
modelo

c

did
a
nice
job
with
this
brew
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
move
it
along
if
you
want
to
drink
beer
south
of
the
border
go
corona
or
dos
equis
at
a
minimum
this
is
pretty
bad
meh
nothing
to
see

there
is
so
much
good
beer
out
there
no
need
to
drink
this
stuff
light
easy
drink
no

flavor
need
a

to
enhance
the
weakness
one
bottle
of
several
poured
into
a
pint
glass
in
cabo
san
lucas
perhaps
the
most
widely
available
shitty
macrolager
in
these
parts
with
the
possible
likely
exception
of
corona
a
pale
yellow
fizzbomb
with
no
head
to
speak
off
although
if
you
deliberately
do
an
aggressive
pour
into
a
clean
glass
you
can
get
about
four
fingers
of
blink
and
you
miss
it
creamy
white
foam
sorry
i
fuck
around
a
little
when
i
get
bored
smells
pretty
mellow
but
whats
there
speaks
of
cooked
corn
whiffs
of
apple
and
grape
hard
candy
skunk
dead
grass
i
am
not
exaggerating
and
sweet
dough
classic
macro
lager
taste
and
feel
has
almost
a
cotton
candy
sweetness
marginally
thicker
and
less
corny
than
corona
but
this
is
not
saying
that
much
more
apple
and
grainy
notes
late
there
is
a
german
brewing
tradition
in
this
beers
pedigree
but
youd
never
know
it
based
on
taste
terrible
brew
truth
be
told
although
a
good
study
for
those
interested
in
intimate
knowledge
of
dms
and
the
odd
fruity
notes
one
gets
with
underaged
beers
if
you
got
a
lime
this
beer
is
wonderful
otherwise
its
just
a
cheep
beer
super
light
watered
down
crap
that
said
it
does
kinda
suck
by
itself
but
so
does
every
other
mexican
style
beer
purchased
from
a
local
liquor
store
served
wellchilled
it
took
me
awhile
to
choke
this
down
and
ill
probably
try
to
pawn
the
other
five
bottles
on
one
of
my
sons
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
lot
but
im
not
getting
a
light
grain
and
slight
lemon
taste
instead
i
got
a
dadgummed
corn
done
spoiled
taste
albeit
a
sweetish
note
along
with
the
spoiled
grain
this
was
offered
on
tap
at
toby
keiths
i
love
this
bar
grill
restaurant
i
was
tempted
just
couldnt
do
it
ordered
a
bud
instead
o
it
could
be
worse
and
could
serve
a
purpose
as
a
lawnmower
beer
but
that
corn
just
ruins
it
for
me
again
dark
beer
lovers
should
refrain
from
rating
a
light
or
medium
lager
brewed
in
the
americas
or
anywhere
for
that
matter
if
ones
pallet
is
partial
toward
sharp
cheddars
why
would
heshe
flapoff
about
a
muenster
or
provolone
something
they
wouldnt
normally
consume
pacifico
is
per
my
experience
one
of
the
two
best
light
lagers
brewed
in
mexico
victoria
being
slightly
crisper
in
my
opinion
lagerspilsners
are
not
known
for
having
heavy
bouquets
as
they
should
not
pacifico
has
an
enjoyable
but
not
overpowering
flavor
therefor
it
mixes
indominantly
with
many
different
meals
pacifico
also
delivers
a
creeping
delightful
wallop
that
should
be
languished
in
not
used
as
an
appetizer
for
a
hard
booze
finish
the
mexican
victoria
has
a
slightly
better
flavor
in
my
opinion
average
summer
lager
golden
color
white
head
malty
aroma
and
taste
etc
nothing
to
explain
light
hoppy
notes
honestly
i
cant
tell
the
difference
between
this
or
a
corona
in
any
case
its
good
but
doesnt
give
me
the
nostalgic
pleasure
of
corona
its
a
decent
beer
this
beer
has
a
time
and
place
it
is
not
to
be
dismissed
out
if
hand
while
lacking
complexity
and
balance
it
hits
the
spot
in
a
hit
day
out
doors
when
you
are
looking
to
throw
back
a
quite
a
few
a
crowd
pleaser
for
good
old
beer
drinkers
good
mouthfeel
and
a
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
mexican
food
thats
how
it
should
be
enjoyed
the
best
mexican
beer
period
overall
well
made
and
enjoyable
mexican
lager
nothing
unpleasant
and
better
than
ordinary
if
hanging
out
and
having
some
ceviche
it
will
certainly
do
the
trick
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
ontap
at
jose
s
blue
sombero
in
waukesha
wi
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
slight
white
head
served
with
lime
the
scent
from
the
lime
overpowers
the
aroma
of
the
beer
taste
is
light
thin
and
pretty
much
absent
smooth
and
easy
drinking
but
not
very
interesting
overall
overall
as
far
as
mexican
lagers
go
i
like
this
one
much
better
than
the
ubiquitous
corona
this
would
be
sublime
with
a
lime
and
a
massive
quantity
of
cheap
tacos
not
much
to
say
other
than
it
was
a
waste
of
time
and
money
id
never
had
this
before
and
didnt
read
reviews
before
buying
little
to
no
aroma
and
not
much
action
for
the
taste
buds
poured
a
whispy
that
dissipated
quite
rapidly
my
money
will
be
better
spent
elsewhere
thats
all
i
have
to
say
bout
that
boy
this
is
nothing
like
i
remember
it
this
is
just
plain
friggin
weird
took
one
hit
for
the
team
there
goes
my
2
50
but
i
am
a
better
man
now
that
i
know
i
didnt
like
sol
or
corona
and
pacifico
isnt
much
better
but
i
think
its
better
take
that
has
a
golden
yellow
hue
much
better
than
other
lighter
cheap
beers
the
smell
is
my
favorite
attribute
smells
strong
of
rich
barley
has
that
grainy
scent
the
taste
is
pretty
good
id
say
well
considering
what
kind
of
beer
youre
dealing
with
somehting
that
of
course
is
great
on
a
hot
day
slightly
alcoholic
but
fades
back
to
refreshing
grains
the
mouthfeel
actually
surprised
me
semifull
good
end
note
this
is
my
favorite
from
mexico
not
a
great
beer
great
for
warm
days
and
camping
when
you
dont
want
something
heavy
and
dont
want
crap
american
lager
fun
to
experiment
with
too
throw
a
chili
in
there
or
some
tabasco
a
fun
beer
you
dont
have
to
think
about
too
hard
o
this
beer
really
paired
well
with
my
enchiladas
just
for
kicks
i
squeezed
the
limes
into
one
and
found
the
taste
to
be
very
pleasant
i
find
some
mexican
beers
to
have
some
off
tastes
but
none
were
evident
with
this
one
if
youre
in
a
mexican
restaurant
and
see
this
one
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
pale
golden
color
with
just
a
wisp
of
white
foam
partially
covering
the
top
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
is
corn
and
vienna
lager
yeast
the
mouth
is
a
bit
thinbut
crisp
flavor
is
corn
and
more
vienna
lager
yeast
this
is
meant
to
be
drank
cold
i
think
it
is
still
my
favorite
mexican
lager
ummm
not
so
good
had
this
straight
out
of
the
bottle
pretty
boring
pilsner
like
a
worse
version
of
a
mexican
rolling
rock
watered
down
pilsner
flavor
it
actually
doesnt
go
that
bad
with
a
spicy
burrito
but
you
can
do
better
for
pilsner
beers
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
no
head
typical
aal
appearance
scents
of
maize
creamed
corn
apple
juice
and
slight
lager
yeast
a
weak
scent
very
sweet
nothing
much
there
to
like
tastes
of
maize
creamed
corn
maize
sugar
watery
apple
juice
and
very
very
slight
hop
extracts
its
a
pretty
bad
aal
flavor
very
sweet
and
just
not
fun
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
high
carbonation
and
watery
its
very
light
let
some
what
hard
to
drink
because
its
so
carbonated
overall
this
was
a
pretty
bad
aal
it
just
wasnt
very
good
at
all
im
only
slightly
biased
with
this
beer
due
to
the
many
awesome
moments
ive
had
drinking
it
in
mexico
dont
expect
much
from
it
but
drop
a
slice
of
lime
in
the
bottle
and
enjoy
with
your
chips
and
salsa
id
take
this
to
the
beach
over
corona
the
beer
isnt
sewer
water
but
it
is
far
from
being
worthy
of
praise
o
make
no
mistake
this
is
much
better
than
corona
but
so
is
getting
bitten
in
the
balls
by
a
honey
badger
i
really
dont
hate
this
one
at
all
and
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
for
free
bohemia
is
still
my
mexican
lager
of
choice
though
the
feel
is
amazingly
refreshing
not
nearly
as
thin
as
one
would
expect
and
excessively
easy
to
drink
pacifico
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
goes
down
smooth
but
leaves
a
slight
unpleasant
after
taste
possibly
from
the
corn
no
freshness
date
to
be
found
on
the
brown
bottle
with
bright
yellow
lable
it
is
comparable
to
other
mexican
beers
like
corona
and
sol
this
has
to
be
my
new
second
favorite
mexican
brew
its
delicious
with
mexican
dining
and
pairs
perfectly
with
it
bought
on
a
whim
from
the
ranch
market
near
my
home
and
was
pleasently
surprised
by
the
taste
and
smell
all
around
great
taco
beer
negro
modelo
is
still
1
but
this
is
a
close
second
i
think
this
beer
should
be
taken
for
what
it
is
a
great
session
beer
there
are
beers
out
there
that
taste
phenomenal
but
you
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
23
of
them
while
this
beer
has
a
pretty
sticky
aftertaste
probably
the
corn
it
doesnt
have
the
tang
of
the
other
americana
mainstays
corona
bud
et
al
it
also
has
a
surprising
maltiness
that
i
would
have
thought
would
not
appeal
to
the
market
try
a
warm
one
as
opposed
to
a
cold
one
that
gives
a
very
nicely
rounded
mouth
feel
while
it
does
have
the
sticky
aftertaste
it
is
in
every
other
way
quite
clean
which
is
a
nice
compromise
between
pure
bitters
and
pure
lagers
this
is
a
good
beer
for
good
sunny
times
i
dont
think
its
going
to
be
winning
any
awards
for
being
super
amazing
or
innovative
but
sometimes
having
your
socks
blown
off
only
means
you
need
to
be
buying
new
socks
all
the
time
it
also
has
the
nice
attribute
of
not
giving
a
man
next
morning
fog
thats
what
the
outstanding
is
for
overall
very
refreshing
beer
its
gets
the
ok
from
me
pacifico
clara
is
a
better
than
average
everyday
beer
with
a
nice
copper
color
and
a
refreshing
thirstquenching
quality
understanding
this
beer
is
not
intended
to
be
a
craft
beer
or
high
gravity
it
beats
most
us
massproduced
beers
hands
down
for
taste
and
quality
mouth
feel
is
nice
though
slightly
watery
which
is
outstanding
on
a
hot
afternoon
once
on
an
early
june
day
hike
in
the
arizona
mountains
i
stuck
a
few
bottles
in
a
melting
snow
bank
at
the
trail
head
before
taking
off
on
my
weary
return
i
cracked
open
bottle
after
bottle
of
pc
and
was
warmly
welcomed
by
an
ice
cold
mexican
kiss
looking
for
a
decent
but
low
key
beer
to
enjoy
with
friends
by
the
grill
pacifico
clara
will
fill
the
bill
nicely
of
all
the
macro
lagers
that
i
have
drunk
lately
pacifico
was
definitely
the
most
offensive
i
cannot
image
why
this
beer
was
so
terrible
on
the
finish
but
i
will
definitely
avoid
it
at
all
costs
in
the
future
mexican
lagers
are
historically
based
on
pilsners
from
germany
and
vienna
and
have
since
gained
their
own
unique
character
light
in
body
and
color
with
a
mild
flavor
pacifico
is
very
appropriate
for
the
style
if
not
at
all
impressive
for
it
featuring
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
pairing
with
southwestern
and
latin
based
dishes
but
is
not
very
enjoyable
on
its
own
there
is
a
blandness
and
a
softness
to
it
that
adventerous
beer
lovers
may
be
left
unimpressed
by
as
a
ubiquitous
and
commercialized
beer
meant
for
consumption
by
the
general
public
it
does
exactly
what
its
supposed
to
do
and
nothing
more
much
more
palatable
than
corona
not
a
beer
id
buy
or
spend
any
of
my
money
on
if
youre
looking
for
watered
down
subpar
beer
then
this
ones
for
you
rather
onedimensional
crisp
and
refreshing
but
sadly
forgettable
o
decent
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
atmosphere
is
okay
decent
head
and
some
respectable
lacing
nose
is
light
and
grainy
light
and
grainy
flavor
as
well
with
a
light
hop
and
a
bit
of
an
offputting
soapy
palate
overall
this
is
a
serviceable
at
best
quaff
overall
i
would
say
this
is
neither
the
worst
and
certainly
not
the
best
beer
of
its
type
i
purchased
a
bomber
of
this
for
2
69
so
i
cant
complain
too
much
in
my
opinion
these
light
lagers
from
the
latin
american
regions
should
have
their
own
classification
aside
from
aal

what
was
a
semi
decent
beach
beer
in
a
bottle
completely
morphs
into
a
flavorless
watery
brew
when
poured
into
a
glass
im
actually
quite
surprised
at
how
drastic
the
difference
is
while
i
cant
say
ill
never
drink
this
again
typical
adjunct
smell
of
grains
and
yeast
the
taste
is
mix
of
old
grains
judging
pacifico
sin
limon
its
just
another
no
frills
cerveza
the
beer
poors
golden
clear
with
good
carbonation
that
give
a
white
foamy
head
for
a
brief
time
the
smell
and
taste
are
enhanced
with
grain
the
hops
help
somewhat
with
the
taste
so
that
it
is
not
bread
water
mouthfeel
is
easy
especially
on
hot

with

but
when
i
tried
to
bottle
some
of
my
homebrew
in
it
the
caps
wouldnt
go
on
straight
so
overall
for
the
mexican
lager
category
not
bad
at
all
in
a
pinch
i
would
take
it
over

their
is

this
is

what
do
you
expect
however
if
you
pair
with
the
right
food

it
a
lager
that
can
be
enjoyed
will
i
try
it

poured
from

to
a

it
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
faded
quickly
it
is
not
a
bad
looking
beer
it
has
the
appearance
of
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
it
has
okay
carbonation
it
smells
a
little
sweet
the
nose
just
isnt
there
pacifico
leaves
a
strange
tasting
film
in
my
mouth
not
that
great
beer
is
medium
to
light
bodied
has
a
harsh
cereal
flavor
that
damages
the
drinkability
there
isnt
much
in
flavor
some
corn
and
some
mild
sweetness
up
front
that
disappears
and
gives
way
to
a
terrible
aftertaste

again
no

required

drinkability
is
probably
on
the
lower
end
of
the
scale
for
adjunct
macros
a
notch
below
corona
or
modello
especial
kind
of
the
busch
beer
of
mexico
i
suppose
its
no
worse
than
a
typical
american
adjunct
its
just
a
mexican
version
of
the
same
d
what
a
sad
beer
i
not
a
huge
fan
of
mexican
beers
to
begin
with
but
there
are
a
few
out
there
that
are
respectable
enough
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
mexican
meal
but
this
one
is
one
of
the
worst
ive
come
across
truly
a
pitiful
beer
once
i
finished
my
notes
i
decided
to
drop
a
lime
into
it
so
i
could
at
least
have
the
pleasure
of
having
a
shred
of
flavor
in
my
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
decent
mex
beer
look
somewhere
else
overall
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
give
an
american
adjunct
lager
and
a
if
it
succeeds
for
what
it
is
but
this
beer
does
not
it
looks
ok
but
beyond
that
it
fails
my
advice
if
you
want
a
cheap
american
adjunct
lager
that
actually
tastes
good
and
is
consistent
go
with
miller
high
life
drinkability
your
typical
macro
lager
this
beer
is
pretty
much
corona
under
a
different
label
dont
be
fooled
d
hot
day
lawn
mower
drinkable
but
thats
about
it
pours
a
light
yellow
straw
with
an
abundance
of
carbonation
but
not
much
of
a
head
smell
is
pungent
grassy
skunky
cat
urine
maybe
a
hint
of
light
malt
taste
is
right
on
par
with
the
smell
kinda
sour
and
expired
tasting
mouthfeel
is
not
the
greatest
i
might
as
well
be
drinking
sparkling
water
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
hatefilled
spiteriddled
beer
that
wants
to
destroy
you
your
pallette
and
other
beers
who
look
like
theyre
having
a
good
time
beware
the
mexican
assassin
i
never
poured
this
into
a
glass
so
i
cant
really
describe
appearance
i
imagine
its
like
a
corona
or
dos
equies
smells
like
a
corona
the
taste
is
a
good
though
refreshing
thankfully
which
is
probably
why
its
a
common
in
my
house
its
decent
to
have
on
a
hot
day
if
nothing
else
is
around
d
i
guess
its
drinkable
but
so
is
water
probably
would
go
well
with
spicy
mexican
food
d
washes
down
more
flavorful
mexican
foods
but
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
drink
this
by
itself
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
expiration
date
or
lot
code
sampled
on
august
8
2009
the
pour
is
straw
yellow
with
virtually
no
head
but
the
head
that
is
there
lingers
the
entire
time
no
lime
used
the
aroma
is
corny
grainy
and
a
bit
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
basically
medium
to
thin
but
is
has
a
kind
of
honey
texture
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
has
a
little
malts
and
a
smidgen
of
hops
but
actually
the
taste
makes
me
think
of
some
kind
of
steak
sauce
or
seasoning
it
is
hard
to
describe
but
that
was
what
i
felt
next
time
i
will
use
the
lime
not
recommend
buy
golden
anniversary
instead
that
way
at
least
you
will
have
a
conversation
starter
still
my
favorite
mexican
adjunct
lager
despite
the
less
than
glowing
review
i
like
it
better
than
corona
drinkability
the
flavor
profile
is
so
weak
and
bland
having
more
than
one
would
leave
the
tastebuds
screaming
for
some
flavor
ok
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
better
then
the
american
major
beers
its
supposed
to
be
a
light
brew
with
little
taste
designed
for
hot
weather
and
it
fits
that
quite
well
d
i
only
buy
this
when
it
is
on
sale
but
by
far
it
is
they
best
tasting
mexican
beer
in
my
opinion
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
golden
color
with
small
head
decent
aroma
with
hints
of
corn
taste
is
soso
and
rather
dry
not
a
lot
of
flavor
feels
light
and
watery
in
the
mouth
average
drinkability
i
guess
not
horrible
but
nothing
special
here
d
not
my
favorite
mexican
beer
and
if
anything
it
tastes
a
little
better
out
of
the
bottle
there
are
better
mexican
beers
than
this
pours
a
pissy
yellow
with
soapy
bubbles
that
float
around
on
top
of
it
no
real
head
retention
to
speak
of
smells
vaguely
corny
and
not
much
else
tastes
of
corn
and
clean
husky
grains
theres
no
hop
bitterness
its
overcarbonated
i
think
but
still
manages
to
have
a
slick
unpleasant
finish
neat
trick
pacifico
marked
the
last
stop
on
my
tour
through
the
beers
at
my
favorite
mexican
restaurants
my
final
conclusion
from
the
tour
is
that
ill
be
drinking
a
steady
flow
of
bohemia
from
here
on
out
you
know
what
i
like
it
for
an
adjunct
lager
sometimes
you
could
see
yourself
drinking
a
beer
that
doesnt
necessarily
knock
you
away
it
is
smooth
and
flavorful
enough
and
is
very
good
for
this
style
its
just
one
of
those
situations
where
you
have
an
import
thats
lackluster
even
when
compared
with
us
macros
and
there
are
tons
of
mexican
imports
that
cost
the
same
and
are
better
cheers
this
drinks
well
enough
on
one
account
because
it
holds
a
fair
amount
of
flavor
however
the
heavier
body
and
excessive
adjunct
make
it
tough
to
tolerate
it
seems
to
lack
a
thirst
quenching
quality
i
feel
full
after
one
and
as
it
typical
with
this
style
any
enjoyable
flavors
leave
as
it
warms
drinkability
is
where
it
should
be
for
the
style
d
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
is
great
or
if
you
are
eating
mexican
food
otherwise
i
would
stay
away
from
it
d
this
is
a
beer
for
people
who
really
dont
like
beer
or
just
want
to
get
a
buzz
off
of
something
that
is
so
light
that
it
tastes
next
to
nothing
although
due
to
that
it
wouldnt
be
impossible
to
drink
a
bunch
because
of
its
light
and
simple
nature
altogether
not
great
but
not
terrible
d
goes
down
really
easily
out
of
all
the
mexican
beers
i
can
get
my
hands
on
this
one
will
probably
be
the
go
to
choice
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
i
wouldnt
necessarily
recommend
it
but
its
definitely
better
than
corona
way
better
than
corona
it
tastes
exactly
like
a
weak
cheap
ordinary
crappy
old
beer
except
for
the
9volt
battery
factor
d
not
exactly
distasteful
but
not
pleasant
for
me
either
not
quite
up
to
par
with
the
fabled
lawnmower
beer
no
real
reason
to
drink
this
one
shockingly
i
dont
think
this
is
even
a
cheap
brand
but
pbr
or
high
life
has
a
lot
more
flavor
and
drinkability
to
it
this
is
beer
for
people
who
dont
want
beer
drinkability
is
alright
refreshing
and
easy
to
pound
away
when
needed

if

could

it

overall
a

beer
that
i
only

if
done

only
makes

overall
not
very

flavor
at
all
ordered
a
bottle
while
eating
at
a
mexican
restaurant
on
a

night
poured
into
a

glass
mostly
yellow
color
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
hue
lots
of
carbonation
thin
fizzy
head
smell
was
unnoticeable
taste
was
pretty
basic
corn
and
sweet
malt
coat
the
throat
slightly
sticky
aftertaste
pretty
watery
so
that
didnt
add
to
the
mouthfeel
but
it
did
add
to
the
only
redeeming
factor
to
this
beer
its
drinkability
very
easy
going
down
matches
up
with
the
cuisine
its
usually
served
with
having
one
with
mexican
food
or
perhaps
on
a
mexican
beach
would
be
the
only
real
reason
to
order
one
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
overall
not
bad
surprisingly
had
some
slightly
different
hop
characteristics
with
some
dryness
on
the
finish
something
i
havent
experienced
in
a
beer
of
its
type
it
definitely
reminded
me
of
dos
equis
lager
easy
drinking
not
complex
but
manages
to
pull
some
flavor
out
i
thought
it
was
okay
but
i
would
have
appreciated
more
flavor
the
flavors
were
a
little
drowned
out
id
say
give
it
a
try
because
it
does
taste
better
than
allot
of
beers
out
there
in
the
same
category
cheers
bland
crisp
drinkable
but
not
very
tasty
your
typical
mexican
lager
not
very
good
but
easy
to
drink
and
relatively
cheap
get
something
else
if
youre
going
for
flavor
as
this
is
just
watered
down
hops
and
grains
with
not
much
else
happening
d
above
average
drinkability
wellworth
the
price
of
a
sixer
for
the
sake
of
experimentation
so
yeah
rock
pacifico
as
instructed
and
youll
be
ok
it
gets
a
3
for
serving
its
purpose
well
and
for
being
drinkable
in
fairly
large
quantities
this
is
one
beer
to
goes
well
with
a
plate
of
spicy
tacos
dont
bother
pouring
into
a
glass
the
bottle
works
just
fine
for
its
smooth
delivery
sweet
with
the
typical
macrobrew
taste
nothing
special
but
makes
a
summer
time
beer
sometimes
i
find
it
for
56pk
not
a
bad
deal
average
beer
from
mexico
i
expected
worse
but
this
is
really
quite
average
its
hardly
a
beer
but
it
excels
at
being
average
small
white
head
didnt
last
for
long
pale
golden
yellow
with
some
subpar
carbonation
this
beer
has
some
serious
graininess
in
the
taste
modelo
makes
a
few
decent
mexican
beers
but
this
one
is
lackluster
from
start
to
finish
overall
you
could
pound
a
ton
of
these
and
feel
like
you
have
been
drinking
water
good
for
a
hot
summer
probably
a
better
lager
than
most
this
beer
has
a
very
harsh
flavor
for
how
light
it
is
lots
of
astringent
bitterness
not
pleasant
while
i
usually
dont
care
too
much
for
mexican
beers
this
was
a
nice
suprise
and
much
better
than
the
much
more
often
seen
corona
color
and
appearance
were
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
i
was
suprised
by
the
taste
and
found
it
pretty
enjoyable
was
picked
up
for
a
mexican
themed
night
with
our
friends
sure
we
switched
between
these
and
margaritas
but
everyone
agreed
that
this
beer
was
a
solid
ok
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
crisp
and
drinkable
enough
for
me
to
finish
it
and
think
twice
about
going
for
another
while
on
vacation
the
taste
is
slightly
different
than
i
expected
as
the
beer
first
hits
the
palate
i
catch
some
citrus
that
i
was
not
expecting
unless
i
added
a
lime
i
definitely
can
taste
the
corn
and
grain
throughout
nothing
spectacular
after
some
margaritas
this
beer
was
an
ok
finisher
went
well
with
tortilla
chips
and
such
but
i
would
have
liked
something
else
not
a
big
fan
of
the
fruit
in
the
beer
but
it
was
a
mexican
restaurant
afterall
i
thought
the
drinkability
was
good
but
i
wish
i
would
have
chosen
a
carona
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
wellcarbonated
and
lively
mouthfeel
aroma
was
corn
and
some
lemon
grass
hop
notes
flavor
of
citrus
and
graina
little
pale
malta
clean
crisp
mouthfeelrefreshingand
drinkable
pretty
good
for
its
style
its
harder
to
grade
these
personally
i
dont
fancy
these
beers
that
much
but
if
i
were
to
grade
within
its
category
it
sort
of
makes
the
cut
bland
drinkable
fizz
water
i
cant
give
it
horrible
grades
for
tasting
the
way
its
supposed
to
so
this
explains
the
higher
rating
sort
of
higher
at
least
compared
to
the
average
pours
gold
with
a
one
inch
fluffy
white
head
minor
lacings
which
disappear
fairly
soon
aroma
is
typical
macro
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malts
with
a
decent
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
kind
of
a
junior
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
makes
you
want
another
taste
easy
drinker
and
would
be
a
good
beach
beer
or
any
other
hot
day
event
certainly
more
character
than
corona
extra
and
as
an
added
bonus
no
skunk
whatsoever
d
i
dont
mind
negro
modelo
and
gave
this
brewer
a
shot
and
pacifico
wont
offend
you
nor
impress
either
this
was
a
pretty
mixed
review
the
appearance
was
terrible
no
head
and
certainly
no
lacing
and
i
couldnt
pick
up
much
from
the
nose
the
taste
oddly
refreshing
with
a
dry
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
was
what
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
really
im
not
sure
what
taste
i
was
getting
from
this
beer
but
i
did
suprisingly
like
it
and
it
was
easy
to
drink
i
always
considered
this
to
be
the
mexican
version
of
grain
belt
premium
maybe
it
was
the
corn
taste
or
it
being
slightly
sweeter
than
usual
either
way
i
dont
care
what
most
people
say
i
rather
enjoyed
this
very
drinkable
good
carbonation
and
taste
this
is
not
a
good
beer
unless
you
take
a
couple
of
shot
first
a
good
afternoon
drinker
for
sure
pours
clear
gold
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
grassy
straw
and
grain
aroma
clean
crisp
taste
of
grain
and
weak
hops
but
not
enough
to
offend
and
you
dont
even
need
a
lime
to
cut
the
taste
drinkability
poor
even
by
macro
lager
standards
not
recommended
enough
is
enough
its
hard
to
finish
one
of
these
christ
wheres
my
slice
of
lime
drinkability
would
prefer
a
corona
well
it
tastes
like
how
i
expected
it
to
a
coronalandshark
clone
i
would
say
this
is
better
by
than
those
other
two
but
its
a
subpar
beer
none
the
less
this
beer
pours
with
zero
head
not
even
like
116
of
an
inch
almost
amazing
to
see
really
drinkable
and
tastes
like
nothing
would
drink
if
it
was
free
but
never
would
buy
it
again
drinkability
especially
since
there
are
much
better
beers
from
mexico
i
would
not
buy
this
again
i
do
not
think
even
a
lime
could
salvage
this
color
is
a
not
very
impressive
clear
strawyellow
aroma
is
crisp
and
typically
lagerish
not
complex
and
not
at
all
promising
flavor
is
rather
thin
and
watery
a
little
malty
with
just
a
little
bit
of
a
zing
and
a
teeny
hint
of
hop
bitterness
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
rather
watery
not
a
serious
beer
but
excellent
for
what
it
is
intended
and
for
what
it
accomplishes
i
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
for
its
ordinary
qualities
it
drinks
very
well
with
pseudocreoletexmex
it
works
just
fine
d
quite
refreshing
and
a
good
palatecleanser
d
yet
another
beer
modelled
after
the
american
macro
swill
totally
uninteresting
and
devoid
of
character
d
well
its
ok
drinkable
but
not
preferable
its
got
a
little
bit
more
going
on
than
a
typical
bmc
macro
lager
but
other
than
that
not
much
to
mention
d
like
corona
with
slightly
more
flavor
but
how
hard
is
that
another
pale
lager
of
a
mexican
beer
from
the
bottle
golden
color
gentle
corn
grainy
uhh
mexican
beer
flavor
which
is
perhaps
a
bit
better
than
some
alternatives
better
than
corona
ok
in
the
sun
or
with
spicy
foods
somewhat
refreshing
and
clean
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
south
of
the
border
and
for
the
price
it
is
ok
if
you
are
going
that
taste
route
you
could
pick
something
with
a
bit
more
structure
and
uh
smoothness
not
offering
much
here
but
a
way
to
quench
your
thirst
a
true
get
tanked
after
mowing
the
lawn
beverage
overall
if
you
must
pale
straw
yellowwhite
head
that
was
gone
in
a
flash
and
little
stickingnot
much
at
all
here
to
the
nosesome
grains
and
grass
is
all
i
getvery
refreshing
on
the
drinkcrisp
and
mild
sweetness
upon
the
early
sipsvery
very
litethis
brew
was
gone
in
a
flashmaybe
with
a
little
bit
of
lime
it
would
have
more
flavorbut
easily
consumed
and
could
be
dranked
all
nite
on
a
hot
dayother
than
thatill
pass
on
it
for
a
evening
beer
this
isnt
even
refreshing
it
leaves
a
pretty
nasty
aftertaste
to
boot
something
pretty
harsh
about
it
though
on
a
hot
day
its
not
impossible
to
finish
but
thats
it
as
for
me
ill
pass
would
rather
drink
water
very
little
redeeming
qualities
to
this
one
thinbodied
and
really
drinkable
what
the
hell
right
drinkability
well
if
you
like
skunked
lagers
this
baby
is
your
cup
of
tea
but
its
not
mine
whoa
this
is
a
very
different
beer
in
the
u
s
after
reviewing
this
beer
in
mexico
last
year
i
think
the
u
s
version
is
quite
different
less
corn
on
the
nose
and
more
hops
similar
creaminess
vs
corona
unlike
the
u
s
mex
and
centralsouth
america
seem
to
celebrate
the
mais
in
their
beer
and
this
is
surely
a
modified
version
of
the
homeland
recipe
not
bad
and
rating
adjusted
for
u
s
edition
not
bad
d
for
what
this
beer
is
it
pretty
refreshing
and
unoffensive
if
it
smelled
and
tasted
better
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
beer
but
to
me
its
just
about
average
decent
head
but
dissipates
quickly
no
lacing
typical
golden
tan
color
perfectly
clear
smell
is
weak
and
what
is
there
isnt
that
pleasant
initial
taste
is
ok
but
very
bland
unimpressive
and
the
aftertaste
is
just
unpleasant
dry
and
a
little
skunky
and
a
little
bitter
overaal
its
not
a
horrible
beer
overall
drinkable
enough
depending
on
the
circumstance
maybe
sitting
on
the
beach
somewhere
it
could
be
more
drinkable
d
not
flavorful
at
all
goes
down
ok
not
filling
at
all
not
much
kick
this
definitely
not
a
good
beer
in
any
way
now
i
would
say
this
is
a
beer
you
should
run
out
to
try
but
its
drinkable
and
certainly
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
its
mexican
beer
thats
a
step
up
from
corona
maybe
even
just
a
baby
step
but
better
still
could
turn
a
few
corona
fans
onto
the
idea
of
drinking
something
a
touch
better
d
light
watery
boring
and
bland
dont
feel
cheated
if
this
is
drainod
10
minutes
of
drinking
this
in
no
way
justifies
the
money
wasted
call
it
a
flush
and
move
on
d
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
but
it
isnt
the
best
macro
out
there
d
very
after
all
this
is
an
american
style
macro
and
it
pulls
it
off
well
not
only
that
it
is
better
than
most
macros
may
not
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
does
represent
the
style
and
i
believe
it
sits
pretty
high
with
the
style
i
think
i
might
be
in
the
minority
here
this
is
not
a
good
beer
as
far
as
complex
taste
depth
or
appeal
however
it
has
some
malt
flavor
slighly
more
than
the
average
macro
and
is
doesnt
have
a
strange
dull
flavor
you
often
find
in
macro
mexican
basic
lagars
overall
drinkable
with
spicey
mexican
food
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crispwith
drinkability
highif
you
want
to
get
hammered
at
the
beachotherwise
stay
clear
of
this
beer
there
are
much
better
mexican
beers
out
thereyes
there
are
good
mexican
beers
to
be
had
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
like
that
of
soda
has
that
distinct
aroma
of
pungent
old
adjunct
malt
although
its
pretty
faint
flavor
is
corny
and
grainy
with
a
finish
like
tap
water
extremely
drinkable
but
why
would
you
want
any
more
this
is
only
slightly
better
than
corona
imo
and
youll
still
likely
pay
through
the
nose
so
id
stay
away
gross
off
flavors
in
the
aroma
almost
smells
like
watered
down
moldy
wort
weak
white
head
atop
yellow
soda
malts
and
hops
have
a
little
bitterness
and
reming
me
of
hay
and
corn
the
body
is
light
and
has
way
too
much
carbonation
a
lime
would
make
this
beer
more
drinkable
not
so
good
though
a
nice
amber
color
to
the
brew
nothing
exceptional
but
very
drinkable
with
no
serious
aftertaste
even
when
accompanied
by
food
overall
i
would
rate
it
as
decent
even
though
it
has
no
real
standout
qualities
which
i
recorded
or
found
worth
writing
down
my
favorite
mexican
macro
and
perfect
for
cinco
de
mayo
i
hadnt
had
a
pacifico
in
awhile
so
im
glad
i
finally
get
to
rate
one
nothing
spectacular
but
with
a
fresh
lime
wedge
it
went
great
with
both
my
chips
and
salsa
and
also
my
steak
and
chicken
fajitas
however
now
im
so
full
i
almost
had
to
be
rolled
home
feliz
cinco
de
mayo
d
well
its
not
offensive
not
much
to
it
boring
but
easy
to
drink
bruce
if
i
find
myself
south
of
the
border
or
at
the
local
mexican
dive
ill
pick
pacifico
over
corona
for
the
fact
that
its
less
likely
to
be
skunky
i
dont
see
where
all
the
dislike
of
this
beer
comes
from
sure
its
nothing
spectacular
but
a
plenty
alright
way
to
wash
down
some
salty
mexican
food
on
a
hot
day
the
taste
is
very
light
mostly
like
hard
apple
cider
but
not
sweet
fairly
dry
and
very
bland
it
has
only
a
faint
hint
of
grain
and
lacks
sweetness
bitterness
or
body
there
is
a
faint
mineral
character
and
it
is
rather
watery
that
said
it
is
not
unpleasant
in
any
way
d
i
had
on
of
these
at
headliners
at
the
meat
puppets
concert
and
i
took
it
back
and
told
them
it
was
bad
when
really
i
just
think
its
fucking
bunk
to
begin
with
bottom
line
flavorless
lawn
mower
beer
d
it
is
drinkable
and
sessionable
i
would
rate
it
as
one
of
the
better
beers
to
have
at
a
mexican
eatery
pours
the
typical
yellow
with
some
white
head
not
much
smell
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
an
average
macro
a
little
malt
with
a
little
hops
the
rest
is
grain
mouthfeel
is
not
good
overcarbonated
no
aftertaste
all
in
all
was
ok
to
drink
not
noteworthy
avoidable
swill
but
not
horrible
i
personally
like
it
better
than
corona
but
that
isnt
saying
too
much
it
is
light
and
some
what
refreshing
obviously
not
a
craft
or
quality
brew
so
i
find
it
fine
to
serve
way
too
cold
with
lime
good
with
food
especially
any
sort
of
grilled
fish
nothing
special
but
good
for
a
mexican
macro
medium
gold
with
a
bit
of
quickly
fading
head
smell
is
very
mild
and
minimal
with
a
touch
of
malt
and
yeast
flavor
is
light
some
malt
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
fades
quickly
and
finishes
lightly
sweet
and
it
is
fairly
highly
carbonated
refreshing
and
probably
my
favorite
mexican
beer
not
great
but
drinkable
and
would
be
one
of
my
top
choices
for
a
cheap
pale
lager
perhaps
d
i
would
never
pay
money
to
drink
this
beer
drinkability
is
decent
there
is
not
anything
here
to
warrent
a
second
bottle
but
nothing
offensive
for
the
palate
either
i
know
it
is
december
so
why
am
i
drinking
quintessential
summer
beers
they
just
sounded
good
today
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
session
glass
it
pours
to
be
a
fairly
pale
clear
beer
with
little
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
on
a
side
not
the
appearance
is
slightly
darker
than
corona
just
because
i
am
comparing
these
beers
side
by
side
the
nose
is
very
faint
some
corn
and
some
weird
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
standard
fare
for
this
type
of
beer
again
with
the
strange
citrus
note
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
especially
when
first
opened
this
beer
want
to
burn
your
tongue
like
corona
i
gave
this
beer
a
higher
score
based
on
drinkability
this
is
another
beer
that
just
goes
great
with
hot
weather
and
the
beach
mouthfeeldrinkability
prickly
and
active
at
first
this
beer
explodes
on
impact
and
then
fades
away
in
seconds
its
thin
and
uninteresting
the
blandest
of
macro
lagers
i
would
never
hit
this
again
it
probably
is
as
good
or
better
than
say
a
corona
it
has
decent
quality
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
bad
made
by
the
same
company
as
corona
but
more
flavor
and
body
i
will
grab
one
of
these
any
time
over
corona
or
some
of
the
other
generic
mexican
lagers
the
taste
has
some
kind
of
citrus
taste
up
front
thats
on
the
bitter
side
but
not
too
pleasant
oh
and
theres
the
corn
thats
enough
theres
not
much
more
that
i
can
say
about
it
than
that
its
a
pretty
poor
excuse
for
a
beer
i
wont
buy
this
again
an
average
looking
beer
from
a
very
elegant
looking
bottle
maybe
a
touch
more
amber
in
its
coloring
than
other
mexcarib
type
brews
a
one
fingered
head
left
the
scene
quicker
than
a
snowball
in
mazatlan
where
this
is
brewed
leaving
nothing
more
than
a
thin
ring
smells
was
faint
some
sweet
malt
and
very
faint
floral
hop
taste
was
right
in
line
with
the
aroma
weak
malt
that
was
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
watery
and
light
bodied
in
mouthfeel
although
this
is
consistant
with
most
brews
from
this
part
of
the
planet
would
drink
this
over
sol
or
corona
anyday
taste
followed
the
malt
but
barely
actually
the
taste
is
rather
tasteless
just
leaves
a
sticky
stale
aftertaste
however
its
rather
unstructured
form
did
drink
like
water
it
went
down
easy
as
long
as
i
didnt
think
about
it
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
you
were
in
the
mood
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
the
best
tasting
but
one
i
will
always
enjoy
carbonation
is
present
and
makes
it
a
nice
refreshing
finish
but
i
added
another
lime
as
that
was
more
enjoyable
than
the
beer
d
easy
to
drink
and
very
thirstquenching
hot
weather
lager
if
you
ever
see
somebody
ask
for
a
corona
over
this
please
show
them
the
error
of
their
ways
d
an
ok
beer
one
of
the
better
macro
lagers
that
i
have
had
pretty
drinkable
as
well
just
nothing
special
about
it
would
not
use
my
own
money
to
purchase
it
in
the
near
future
overall
its
a
bit
weak
on
taste
but
is
drinkable
overallmy
memory
serves
me
half
correctly
it
does
have
more
flavor
than
corona
it
is
just
bad
flavor
i
tried
another
with
the
ubiquitous
lime
wedge
it
was
better
but
still
bad
pours
a
nice
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
lacking
but
definitely
not
skunky
as
in
other
mexican
beers
that
i
have
tried
the
taste
is
not
bad
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
is
certainly
refreshing
lots
of
carbonation
but
not
too
much
not
a
heavy
beer
which
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
straw
yellow
crystal
clear
thin
white
head
some
lace
spots
settles
to
a
thin
layer
smell
is
sweet
corny
citrus
kind
of
odd
taste
is
similar
sweet
and
corny
some
citrus
somewhat
nasty
very
weak
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
another
stellar
beer
courtesy
of
jan
thanks
man
pacifico
clara
is
an
easy
to
drink
thirstquenching
hot
weather
lager
its
a
step
up
tastewise
from
the
traditional
bmcs
though
not
a
huge
step
recommended
but
only
if
its
served
at
35
degrees
on
an
85
degree
day
seems
more
authentic
than
the
corona
but
that
could
just
be
my
ignorance
shining
through
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
better
than
corona
poured
into
pint
glass
yellow
and
clear
head
quickly
dissolves
i
like
the
taste
but
in
order
to
fully
appreciate
it
add
a
slice
of
lemon
or
lime
i
found
that
this
is
one
of
only
a
few
beers
where
that
actually
works
high
carbonation
as
everyone
else
stated
overall
not
too
bad
i
havent
yet
tasted
a
lot
of
other
mexican
beers
but
this
one
isnt
too
bad
light
and
easy
drinking
pretty
much
a
standard
run
of
the
mill
beer
as
far
as
american
style
macro
lagers
go
this
is
actually
an
import
from
mexico
it
was
definitely
not
worth
the
4
50
i
paid
for
it
on
a
recent
trip
to
the
boneyard
with
my
twin
sister
this
beer
is
a
very
light
pale
clear
golden
color
head
is
about
12
inch
when
poured
doesnt
stick
around
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
and
settles
to
a
thin
ring
lining
the
inside
of
the
glass
with
very
little
surface
covering
or
lacing
aromas
of
nothing
i
can
really
identify
are
present
maybe
a
hint
of
floral
hops
andor
malt
along
with
some
vegetable
adjuncts
there
was
something
there
though
taste
hmm
well
i
guess
there
was
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
along
with
some
corn
and
grain
maybe
has
a
fairly
thin
and
watery
but
also
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
with
light
to
moderate
carbonation
pretty
light
body
it
sure
goes
down
easy
but
not
in
the
way
that
good
beer
should
i
feel
that
i
may
be
too
generous
in
giving
this
beer
as
high
ratings
as
i
am
giving
it
it
wasnt
terrible
but
far
from
great
just
average
better
than
corona
but
certainly
not
as
good
as
dos
equis
d
this
is
easily
the
best
mexican
beer
that
you
can
find
at
a
bar
but
in
absolutely
no
terms
is
it
the
best
mexican
beer
produced
this
obviously
pairs
well
with
northwestern
mexican
cuisine
but
dont
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
you
can
pair
this
beer
with
any
cuisine
south
of
jalisco
drinkability
is
ok
bland
and
fairly
unoffensive
this
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
memorable
one
it
would
great
ice
cold
on
a
beach
somewhere
or
paired
with
mexican
food
for
authenticity
and
effect
other
than
that
its
nothing
special
this
beer
was
being
given
away
during
cinco
de
mayo
so
i
grabbed
one
nothing
notable
about
this
beer
didnt
smell
very
strong
or
taste
very
good
not
too
offensive
though
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
but
if
found
for
free
it
is
better
then
drinking
no
beer
not
too
bad
for
a
macro
looks
like
the
rest
and
basically
the
same
in
other
respects
but
with
a
bit
more
pilsner
character
you
can
almost
detect
some
vegetal
hop
aromas
in
this
one
very
crisp
and
light
mouthfeel
lots
of
force
carbonation
of
course
malt
adjuncts
are
not
as
noticeable
in
this
one
as
with
most
macro
lagers
wouldnt
be
terrible
on
a
hot
summer
day
notes
the
apperance
of
this
one
is
its
real
downfall
it
looks
unimpressive
from
the
nohead
soft
drink
like
pour
no
lacing
standard
macro
color
the
only
saving
grace
are
its
tiny
bubbles
that
rise
from
the
side
of
the
glass
odd
duck
on
one
hand
i
like
it
due
to
its
floral
hopping
on
the
other
hand
its
a
somewhat
insipid
thin
beer
shizobrew
cheers
pours
with
a
white
head
and
no
lace
bit
overcarbonated
also
a
bit
thin
floral
qualities
are
less
than
they
used
to
be
a
shame
used
to
remind
me
of
bohemia
which
in
turn
is
also
lamer
than
it
used
to
be
forgetable
12

aftertaste
of
and
at
a
few
local
mexican
restaurants
in
my
town
your
options
are
this
or
corona
funny
thing
is
unless
i
had
them
side
by
side
i
might
have
trouble
telling
the
difference
best
to
give
them
both
a
miss
and
order
the
tequila
ive
had
worse
ones
but
this
one
still
isnt
great
this
beer
is
a
rather
normal
looking
cerveza
yellow
and
thin
as
usual
the
smell
is
a
bit
of
that
sour
musty
smell
you
get
from
a
corona
but
not
as
pungent
and
stinky
the
taste
is
a
pretty
smooth
even
gold
but
leaves
the
tounge
feeling
slightly
dry
the
mouth
being
dry
may
make
you
want
to
drink
more
which
may
be
the
point
however
when
this
beer
is
cold
and
its
hot
as
hell
id
grab
one
any
day
they
dont
taste
that
bad
and
are
pretty
easy
to
swill
down
one
after
the
other
some
people
like
their
cerveza
with
a
lime
and
it
might
taste
good
in
this
but
i
prefer
to
leave
mine
alone
so
grab
a
pacifico
and
tell
corona
to
get
bent
drinkability
is
good
in
some
cases
it
is
even
excellent
such
as
the
drive
from
the
airport
in
cabo
san
lucas
to
the
resorts
about
an
hour
drive
let
the
taxi
driver
actually
command
the
vehicle
just
sit
back
relax
and
plan
some
deep
sea
fishing
for
the
next
day
poured
into
a
glass
the
color
looks
appetizing
but
the
head
does
not
it
has
faint
smells
of
corn
husks
and
a
small
dose
of
malts
the
taste
uhhh
fudge
it
im
thirsty
husky
husky
husky
this
beers
role
is
to
quench
your
thirst
not
your
taste
buds
so
maybe
now
i
see
why
this
beers
popularity
is
growing
fast
assuming
the
beer
is
cold
you
can
drink
it
like
water
without
many
flavors
getting
in
the
way
doesnt
taste
like
much
but
it
goes
great
with
enchiladas
chips
and
hot
sauce
if
im
going
for
a
light
mexican
beer
pacifico
aint
bad
i
definitely
wouldnt
recommend
drinking
it
without
food
though
hope
this
helps
drinkability
is
good
if
you
are
thirsty
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
you
dont
have
water
or
soda
overall
recommend
if
used
to
drinking
corona
youll
find
a
bit
more
flavor
here
i
think
this
is
a
rough
cerveza
to
take
it
is
a
very
light
pale
straw
and
has
no
head
retention
at
all
the
smell
is
notably
citrus
in
nature
but
smells
completely
off
the
taste
is
light
bland
and
sour
a
not
completely
painful
mouthfeel
but
way
too
thin
this
is
a
drain
flush
for
me
at
worst
and
chokable
at
best
another
corona
wanttobe
light
and
fizzy
on
the
palate
exactly
how
this
style
is
supposed
to
be
i
could
drink
this
all
night
just
about
anyone
could
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
better
than
a
bmc
brew
however
why
would
i
want
to
waste
my
time
and
money
drinking
this
swill
when
i
could
be
drinking
something
much
better
with
much
more
flavor
the
only
reason
i
would
buy
this
again
is
for
the
bottles
which
i
use
for
homebrewing
anyway
this
poured
the
standard
golden
straw
colour
with
a
snow
white
frost
on
top
that
faded
away
pretty
quick
co2
bubbles
steadily
stream
upwards
smell
was
was
yeasty
and
bready
with
a
little
bit
of
grain
in
there
as
well
taste
was
very
light
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
i
wasnt
expecting
nice
a
bit
grassy
as
well
i
could
drink
mexiswill
all
day
long
and
especially
with
fajitas
or
nachos
this
was
like
100s
of
other
mexican
latin
american
brews
i
have
had
in
the
past
except
for
the
bitterness
thing
mediumlight
brownishyellow
similar
to
apple
juice
with
a
small
white
fizzy
quickly
and
fully
diminishing
head
smells
moderately
sweet
biscuitlike
malt
corn
apple
and
very
light
hops
taste
is
a
bit
better
sweet
and
fruity
pear
most
notable
with
some
weak
malts
and
butter
it
has
a
thin
body
sodalike
carbonation
and
texture
this
tastes
like
a
more
refreshing
version
of
corona
but
that
doesnt
say
much
oddly
good
in
a
way
though
but
subpar
overall
pacifico
was
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
was
small
to
start
with
and
quicky
dissapeared
leaving
only
a
thin
ring
with
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
malt
the
taste
was
grainy
and
odd
with
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
highly
carbonated
drinkablity
was
not
the
best
its
even
subpar
for
a
mexican
macro
lager
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
weak
corona
when
i
drank
this
beer
the
color
was
alright
and
the
taste
was
alright
but
thats
it
i
mean
i
would
much
rather
drink
a
dos
equis
i
enjoy
a
good
mexican
beer
every
once
in
a
while
just
a
little
too
light
for
my
taste
this
is
an
alright
macro
lager
taste
is
non
offensive
as
well
as
the
smell
its
worth
at
least
one
try
if
i
lived
in
mexico
and
was
hot
and
sweaty
all
the
time
and
eating
a
lot
of
spicy
food
and
this
was
priced
reasonably
id
drink
it
but
in
my
store
its
89
for
a
sixer
i
cant
justify
buying
it
at
that
price
wouldnt
mind
doing
a
blind
taster
sometime
with
the
mexican
lagers
if
i
could
be
assured
they
were
all
fresh
i
always
think
of
corona
when
i
drink
pacifico
it
has
a
bit
more
character
of
course
with
better
mouthfeel
it
also
seems
less
skunky
than
corona
a
slight
floral
scent
followed
by
adjuncts
maybe
corn
very
carbonated
drinkability
is
better
than
i
expected
it
would
be
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
especially
if
you
enjoy
mexican
beers
such
as
modelo
or
corona
i
would
suggest
drinking
this
with
a
lime
a
lime
isnt
going
to
hurt
anything
here
regardless
of
the
brown
bottle
everyone
loves
pacifico
in
san
diego
its
the
in
beer
at
the
moment
so
i
figured
id
tag
along
the
appearance
isnt
really
that
bad
its
pale
but
its
got
a
sort
of
cloudiness
to
it
youll
want
to
drink
this
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
lime
by
the
way
the
smell
is
hardly
there
a
bit
floral
distant
corn
the
taste
average
nothing
impressive
nothing
offensive
a
nice
beer
to
chill
with
needless
to
say
much
better
than
corona
has
a
nice
mildly
sweet
floral
character
to
it
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
water
like
all
mexican
beers
sans
modelo
negro
drinkability
is
the
best
part
about
this
beer
endless
days
by
the
pool
with
a
lime
in
one
are
always
good
no
matter
what
the
beer
geeks
might
say
d
amazingly
drinkable
much
like
water
d
easy
to
drink
for
a
while
but
the
taste
is
somewhat
prohibitive
salud
somewhere
in
between
a
regular
macro
and
corona
i
definitely
prefer
this
to
corona
but
that
isnt
saying
much
pours
very
pale
straw
with
outstanding
clarity
fizzy
one
finger
head
but
holds
a
thin
cap
for
a
moment
and
leaves
a
spec
or
two
of
lace
clean
nose
just
some
faint
corn
and
rice
aromas
malted
rice
bite
upfront
followed
by
a
flash
of
extra
pale
malt
sweetness
semidry
aftertaste
that
hints
at
a
saazesque
spiciness
and
skunk
very
light
in
flavor
but
balanced
an
in
no
way
offensive
thin
body
and
high
carbonation
give
it
crisp
and
watery
mouthfeel
but
seems
conducive
to
high
drinkability
in
a
humid
weather
thin
and
watery
theres
nothing
complex
about
it
thats
not
to
say
the
subtleties
make
it
a
fine
lager
its
the
wateriness
that
makes
it
refreshing
that
and
it
being
generally
served
very
cold
another
sign
of
poor
quality
the
color
is
not
particularly
enticing
and
its
possibly
overcarbonated
its
grainy
with
a
slight
bitterness
that
neither
adds
nor
detracts
from
the
flavor
its
drinkable
but
generally
speaking
ill
reach
for
something
else
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
bland
taste
whats
nice
about
it
is
that
it
does
have
a
nice
hint
of
floral
aroma
and
a
slight
hops
taste
very
clean
though
the
taste
of
the
beer
becomes
even
cleaner
with
along
with
some
salt
potatoe
chips
slight
corn
taste
but
its
all
good
overall
however
its
quite
basic
and
offers
next
to
nothing
to
hold
your
interest
save
this
one
for
when
your
boat
goes
up
in
flames
burning
all
but
the
plexiglass
hull
and
youre
left
to
drift
in
shark
infested
waters
awaiting
rescue
taste
is
thin
but
some
burning
soapiness
and
some
wishywashy
too
sweet
malt
a
slight
unpleasant
sourness
that
could
be
hops
but
again
wholly
unpleasant
mouthfeel
is
thin
bodied
dry
and
a
bit
fizzy
better
than
corona
but
not
by
much
thats
forsure
pours
to
a
golden
yellow
with
a
quickly
disapating
head
smell
is
cornylike
with
hints
of
cascade
hops
taste
is
not
overly
exciting
but
consistent
throughout
not
bitter
nor
sweet
from
lips
to
throat
flavor
is
steady
finishes
clean
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
very
refreshing
and
clean
on
a
hot
day
a
good
thirst
quenching
beer
with
a
hint
of
lime
maybe
even
more
so
for
my
buck
better
than
the
more
popular
corona
a
crisp
yellow
color
with
a
rocky
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
to
a
thin
whisp
of
white
on
top
my
beer
smell
is
sweet
and
grainy
not
else
really
more
of
a
corn
like
scent
than
anything
dont
really
care
for
that
the
taste
is
sweet
and
nothing
else
really
not
a
very
descriptive
sweetness
just
kinda
bland
with
little
or

in

i
will
say
that
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this

on

on
a

about
what
youd
expect

this

drinkability
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
but
the
lack
of
taste
may
get
to
be
too
much
i
could
have
this
with
a
meal
and
stand
it
but
i
wouldnt
drink
a
lot
of
them
this
beer
gave
me
cottonmouth
to
sum
it
up
in
one
word
before
i
get
into
specifics
awful
and
theres
a
good
chance
your
local
liquor
store
already
discontinued
it
for
low
sales
the
tavern
that
still
has
it
for
a
buckfifty
a
bottle
well
they
are
just
trying
to
get
rid
of
it
straw
color
rusty
flavor
no
nose
whatsoever
had
the
head
of
a
cola
i
mean
i
know
most
all
mexican
beers
are
for
the
most
part
crappy
but
damn
they
could
have
at
least
tried
to
make
a
decent
beer
the
one
thing
i
did
like
was
the
drinkability
one
could
drink
this
for
days
if
only
looking
to
get
soused
spring
breakers
alert
stock
up
on
this
when
going
to
your
southwesternmexican
destinations
its
cheap
and
its
cheap
but
beer
is
beer
and
this
is
cheap
beer
but
it
will
get
the
job
done
other
than
that
dont
bother
with
pacifico
even
a
skunked
corona
would
be
better
than
this

finally
a

not
in

clear

with
a

dissipates
quickly
smells
of

with
more
of

taste
some
fruitiness
in
the

crisp

nothing

i
will
take
this
over

any
time
receives
slightly
higher

i

thats

you
add

over
a

clear

bright

colored
body
smells
of
saaz
hops
ie
tin
with
a
very
mild
malt
sweet
underneath
plus
a
touch
of
carboard
amazingly
there
is
a
hint
of
grassy
hop
coho
in
the
nose
tastes
more
sweet
than
hoppy
malt
is
clean
of
fruity
esters
its
a
simple
sweet
with
some
dry
bisuity
character
that
stands
over
a
saaz
hop
tin
flavor
thats
got
a
dirty
character
to
it
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
such
that
acrid
carb
is
a
bit
of
the
taste
profile
some
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
burns
my
tastebuds
a
bit
with
each
gulp
i
was
expecting
a
skunked
foul
beer
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
macro
lagers
ive
ever
had
judged
to
style
not
my
stoutloving
preferences
cant
put
a
finger
on
this
beer
is
it
a
corona
without
skunk
it
is
not
a
terrible
brew
its
way
better
that
huge
domestics
like
the
ab
or
coors
light
malty
aroma
vienna
type
malts
in
flavor
and
subdued
bitterness
on
the
beach
you
could
drink
cold
ones
for
a
long
time
decent
mouthfeel
and
not
til
you
hit
the
10th
one
do
you
start
to
get
that
bad
aftertaste
since
it
was
in
the
bottle
i
coudnt
see
it
but
as
i
would
imagine
it
would
be
a
light
yellow
the
smell
it
wasnt
skunky
but
there
was
no
sweetness
to
it
nor
was
it
a
bitter
smell
it
just
smelled
bad
kind
of
like
how
it
tasted
nothing
jumps
out
at
all
in
this
beer
especially
when
warm
it
wasnt
even
refreshing
for
christs
sakes
i
wouldnt
even
consider
it
a
beer
the
only
quality
that
would
put
it
in
the
same
category
is
that
it
has
alcohol
the
end
this
is
a
step
below
corona
as
far
as
im
concerned
because
without
the
lime
and
warm
no
way
i
would
ever
want
this
beer
again
this
brew
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
mildly
sweet
but
very
faint
the
taste
is
of
water
and
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
is
worse
than
the
taste
it
is
of
carbonation
mixed
with
water
overall
this
is
one
off
the
worst
beers
i
have
every
had
this
is
something
i
would
wish
upon
my
enemies
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
especially
when
paired
with
regional
dishes
andor
warm
weather
i
really
like
this
beer
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
standby
lager
to
keep
in
the
fridge
dont
let
bias
overcome
you
try
it
with
an
open
mind
highly
carbonated
punch
with
a
light
corn
flavor
taste
watered
down
mouthfeel
that
reminds
me
of
seltzer
water
slightest
presence
of
hops
on
the
finish
d
very
harsh
and
hard
to
knock
back
tastes
like
they
rush
the
fermentation
not
recommended
poured
a
pale
golden
not
much
smell
not
much
taste
a
bit
of
malt
coats
the
tongue
but
a
bit
watery
not
much
to
recommend
here
another
brew
to
slam
on
a
hot
day
its
better
than
some
american
macros
in
that
it
doesnt
have
any
unpleasant
tastes
just
not
much
taste
at
all
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
tiny
white
head
very
bubbly
looking
the
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
maybe
a
little
corn
and
a
little
club
soda
the
taste
is
similar
not
offensive
but
not
really
anything
damn
id
like
to
pull
some
kind
of
flavor
out
of
the
bottle
i
guess
its
a
little
sweet
here
and
there
the
mouthfeel
is
all
carbonation
actually
the
whole
beer
could
be
summed
up
by
its
massive
and
prickly
carbonation
dry
finish
drinkable
i
suppose
it
would
probably
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
maybe
it
would
taste
good
if
i
went
a
few
months
without
drinking
any
real
beer
very
limited
appeal
in
this
one
a
thin
hollow

watery

with

decently
clean

sure
if
accompanied
by
a
spicy
meal
or
at
the
end
of
a
drinking
eve
when
your
palate
is
wrecked
anyway
but
ultimately
pass
this
one
by
go
with
brooklyn

be

some

this
washed
down

alright
but
thats
about
it
im
still
looking
for
something
from
mexico
which
might
compete
with
bohemia
an
exceptional
mexican
pilsner
beer
made
only
regionally
at
the
beginning
of
twenty
century
in
the
sinaloas
area
before
was
commercialized
in
all
the
country
this
beer
is
special
for
the
sushi
fish
and
seafood
smell
and
taste
with
a
touch
of
hops

like
a
classic
pilsener
with
a
fragant
and

99recommended
drinkability
i
give
this
high
scores
for
drinkability
it
really
is
a
solid
summer
beer
and
it
goes
fast
when
its
on
hand
perhaps
the
new
distribution
of
this
beer
has
been
a
goal
for
the
brewery
a
lot
of
people
like
it
in
sunny
days
it
is
very
drinkable
and
wont
get
you
durnk
so
easy
the
colour
is
pale
yellow
the
one
for
a
lager
here
but
the
closest
you
are
to
the
city
were
it
is
brewed
the
best
it
tastes
drinkability
well
average
i
would
prefer
this
to
many
american
macros
at
a
party
i
even
went
and
bought
a
tshirt
off
of
ebay
this
is
still
however
my
macro
choice
not
as
painful
as
most
and
fun
when
youre
at
a
mexican
restaraunt
pours
from
the
bottle

with

spit

that
fades
very
quickly

with

barley
malt
and
flowery

initial
taste
is
barley
malt
and
a
few
hops
then

because
it
is
a
mexican
beer

there
has
to
be
at
least
an
homage
to
the
obligatory
sulphur
and
skunk

but
thankfully
not
too
bad
mouth
feel
is

oh
well
a
good
lawn
mowing
brew
well
its
quaffable
i
have
no
idea
how
long
this
particular
six
pack
had
been
sitting
in
my
friends
outdoor
frig
in
the
middle
of
the
mohave
desert
but
i
had
high
hopes
for
it
for
some
reason
perhaps
because
they
were
smart
enough
to
put
it
in
a
brown
bottle
as
if
they
had
something
to
preserve
i
popped
it
open
poured
it
in
a
cup
yes
a
cup
so
i
have
no
idea
what
the
clarity
was
like
the
smell
was
a
little
sour
with
some
grain
behind
it
and
the
head
was
fairly
large
and
then
gone
the
taste
too
was
of
light
grain
and
hops
overwhelmed
by
the
sour
astringency
hmm
i
should
give
this
one
another
chance
in
a
controlled
environment
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
living
life
south
of
the
border
youre
better
off
with
a
corona
or
better
yet
a
drink
with
that
little
umbrella
in
it
overall
impression
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
as
far
as
the
mexican
swills
go
it
isnt
bad
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
virtually
no
head
smell
is
typical
macro
grainy
malt
smell
and
not
much
else
taste
is
pretty
standard
mexican
lager
although
i
was
suprised
that
it
was
more
tasty
than
average
a
step
above
corona
or
modelo
taste
is
dominated
by
a
grainy
malt
flavor
and
a
very
light
grassy
hops
flavor
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
and
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
high
carbonation
i
see
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
in
mexico
it
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
had
part
of
a
12pack
of
this
last
time
i
was
in
chicago
i
thought
it
was
horrible
much
worse
than
i
had
remembered
this
shit
tastes
like
cheap
cheap
malt
liquor
and
i
know
my
malts
no
one
else
drinking
them
thought
they
were
so
bad
but
i
could
hardly
swallow
this
astringent
funk
not
recommended
i
would
much
rather
have
sol
modelo
especial
or
even
corona
extra
over
this
pisswater
overall
it
is
decent
and
better
than
a
lot
of
mexican
beers
but
not
all
that
great
on
the
whole
apparently
this
beer
is
known
to
be
had
with
seafood
well
for
me
i
had
it
with
mexican
food
and
tasted
just
fine
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
few
lagers
that
i
have
had
from
mexico
that
is
not
weak
and
watery
this
is
definitely
one
of
mexicos
better
beers
thin
water
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
want
another
of
these
ick
keep
it
away
whats
worst
than
corona
its
idiot
stepcousin
i
just
cant
have
another
of
these
served
icy
cold
it
complements
an
authentic
unpronouncable

not
taking

thrown

certainly
drinkable
worth
a
nod
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
light
and
refreshing
but
dont
want
to
stoop
to
light
beer
certainly
a
good
thistquencher
on
a
hot
day
but
one
dimensional
d
very
light
but
not
very
pleasant
to
drink
the
light
hops
and
malt
makes
this
beer
beg
for
a
lime
or
fruit
to
hide
what
taste
there
it
has
it
would
be
nice
to
see
a
little
floral
hops
or
a
light
pale
malt
taste
in
this
beer
picked
this
up
tonight
because
it
is
one
of
the
few
mexican
beers
available
here
that
i
havent
tried
next
up
is
the

just

appearance
is

adjuct
yellow
not
too
watery
with
almost
no

is
clean
no
skunk
because
of
the
brown
bottle
otherwise
its
grainy
taste
is
predictably
grainy
and
middleoftheroad
onedimensional
but
not
really
bad
this
is
better
than
its
american
counterparts
but
not
worth

in

mexico
from
a
bottle
ive
had
many
of
these
before
so
i
figured
i
would
have
it
again
and
actually
write
some
notes
on
it
a
pretty
decnt
beer
im
even
a
little
impressed
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
and
the
slightest
of
lacing
smells
of
sweet
maybe
fruity
or
floral
hops
maybe
a
bit
of
corn
or
rice
or
something
i
cant
really
tell
what
the
other
scent
is
the
hops
in
this
beer
are
pretty
tasty
good
in
fact
maybe
a
bit
too
mach
carbonation
not
really
watery
at
all
a
very
good
beer
while
sitting
on
the
beach
or
kicking
back
with
a
few
fish
tacos
wish
they
had
buckets
of
these
on
the
beach
instead
of
corona
nothing
spectacular
but
id
definitely
take
it
over
corona
or
any
of
the
american
macros
any
day
this
is
an
extraordinarily
clear
golden
brew
with
a
small
white
head
its
effervescent
in
a
sodawater
sort
of
way
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
faint
hops
mingled
with
a
faint
vegetable
smell
taste
is
grainy
and
only
slightly
sweet
not
much
going
on
here
the
body
is
light
and
almost
watery
the
beer
is
a
disappointment
but
the
finish
does
have
a
nice
clean
hoppiness
overallits
unimpressive
and
not
worth
the
effort
slightly
better
than
corona
but
that
is
not
saying
much
pours
the
standard
golden
pale
yellow
with
the
fizzle
of
a
head
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
corn
but
this
one
has
a
nice
citrus
floral
brush
that
pleases
the
nose
the
taste
is
slightly
fruity
grain
is
the
strong
note
hear

and
get
something
better

need
water
beer
pale
very
clear
almost
metallic
body
with
a
thin
bigbubbled
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
completely
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
actually
has
a
respectable
bit
of
grassy
hops
theres
a
bit
of
cooked
rice
in
the
mix
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
tad
sweet
up
front
but
fairly
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
something
thats
almost
salty
i
dont
think
i
really
like
it
all
that
much
very
watery
better
than
expected
but
still
not
that
good
its
pretty
much
like
mexican
heineken
pours
a
crisp
gold
colour
with
a
slight
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
well
the
smell
is
pretty
faint
a
bit
sweetfloral
with
some
grain
perhaps
very
basic
the
taste
here
again
remineded
me
a
bit
of
heineken
but
without
the
skunk
some
grain
and
some
sweetness
like
in
the
smell
but
thats
about
it
sadly
for
a
mass
produced
lager
this
is
one
of
the
better
tasting
ones
and
its
far
from
great
far
from
good
even
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
just
the
same
id
only
really
ever
try
this
again
if
at
a
mexican
restaurant
and
they
didnt
carry
or
were
out
of
negra
modelo
far
and
away
the
best
mexibrew
or
dos
equis
amber
this
one
is
definitely
better
than
a
corona
but
what
isnt
when
in
mexico
drink
something
else
pacifico
isnt
as
offensive
as
some
amls
but
thats
hardly
a
recommendation
the
only
thing
memorable
about
it
is
that
it
may
be
the
cheapest
single
that
ive
ever
purchased
0
79
i
cant
decide
if
i
got
my
moneys
worth
or
not
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
too
much
it
distracts
the
tongue
from
any
flavor
that
may
be
in
there
decided
to
get
a
sixpack
of
pacifico
for
cinco
de
mayo
and
have
just
finished
them
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
when
doing
something
like
a
cinco
de
mayo
gathering
but
not
something
i
would
normally
get
the
brew
pours
to
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
very
short
lived
white
bubbly
head
that
breaks
down
to
hardly
no
lacing
what
so
ever
the
aroma
is
noting
to
write
home
about
grass
and
a
sweetness
that
is
ok
the
taste
is
ok
reminds
me
of
american
macros
but
with
some
more
character
a
lot
of
nice
carbonation
with
a
corn
and
light
malt
flavor
not
bad
on
a
very
hot
day
would
take
this
one
before
a
corona
this
thing
pours
the
typical
yellow
fizz
and
sports
a
tiny
little
head
aromas
are
none
the
appealingadjuncty
and
disjointed
this
beer
seems
to
plead
for
a
slice
a
lime
to
lift
it
to
greater
heights
and
hide
its
flaws
its
like
the
beer
forgot
to
apply
deodorant
and
now
its
all
in
the
raw
and
smelling
ripe
the
mouthfeel
is
soda
like
in
texture
fizzy
and
very
watery
flavors
are
virtually
non
existant
an
unnatural
grainy
cloying
sweet
nastiness
remains
on
the
finish
reminding
me
to
switch
brands
this
is
the
stuff
that
you
get
sick
on
in
high
school
and
no
wonder
a
thin
clear
yellow
in
appearance
a
splash
of
white
head
that
quickly
fizzles
out
grainy
metallic
on
the
nose
a
little
skunky
with
a
phantom
of
citrus
that
i
thought
i
was
imagining
at
first
no
lemon
in
the
glass
more
graincorn
for
the
flavour
up
front
becomes
a
bit
sweeter
on
the
finish
but
no
real
complexities
to
take
note
of
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
a
beer
to
throw
back
when
its
scorching
outside
but
i
didnt
take
much
pleasure
in
sampling
this
ill
pass
next
time
pours
forth
with
a
clean
white
head
settling
over
clear
pale
yellow
amply
carbonated
liquid
nose
is
clean
malt
with
a
background
corny
adjunct
and
zip
in
the
hop
dept
the
taste
is
sweet
at
first
then
a
carbonic
palate
burn
some
delicate
maltiness
and
the
barest
suggestion
of
hoppiness
finishes
semisweet
and
light
all
in
all
a
decent
lawnmower
brew
nothing
more
nothing
less
senor
a
drinkable
brew
that
some
will
not
like
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
mexican
beer
its
been
four
or
five
years
since
ive
had
one
so
i
wont
be
able
to
compare
this
to
a
corona
or
any
other
mexican
this
one
pours
a
clear
light
peach
color
with
a
one
finger
soapy
white
head
that
lasts
about
twenty
seconds
not
much
to
the
aroma
maybe
some
faint
lemon
soda
mouthfeel
is
all
carbonation
taste
is
lemony
tart
all
the
way
through
with
active
carbonation
no
offtastes
but
nothing
to
mention
in
all
honesty
i
would
use
a
dark
beer
like
negro
modelo
to
boil
fresh
pacific
or
gulf
shrimp
in
and
enjoy
this
clara
to
wash
down
the
shrimp
while
watching
the
sun
set
in
the
western
sky
from
the
veranda
of
an
ancient
seaside
villa
this
is
some
nasty
stuff
very
light
very
clear
mediciny
nose
minimal
malt
some
grainy
hop
bitterness
nasty
off
flavors
astrigent
and
harsh
this
is
an
unpleasant
product
that
i
poured
out
after
about
12
of
the
bottle
life
is
too
short
to
drink
this
ps
pacifico
came
in
a
brown
bottle
and
was
a
light
clear
gold
color
with
good
carbonation
the
head
was
unimpressive
and
was
quickly
gone
there
was
no
lace
the
smell
was
a
little
grainy
not
skunky
with
a
trace
of
citrus
the
taste
was
also
grainy
with
some
hop
bite
and
a
little
sweetness
the
finish
was
dry
and
grainy
something
to
shoot
down
on
hot
day
and
not
really
dwell
on
i
hadnt
had
this
beer
for
years
and
i
remembered
it
tasting
better
i
was
inspired
to
try
it
again
after
seeing
the
high
commander
and
his
crew
supposedly
drinking
it
on
a
rerun
of
third
rock
from
the
sun
that
product
placement
sold
at
least
one
bottle
of
pacifico
i
cant
vouch
for
the
history
of
this
batch
someone
brought
it
over
so
it
may
be
skunked
as
it
stands
now
though
one
of
the
worst
ive
had
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
the
aroma
is
actually
not
bad
it
has
a
bit
of
citrousalmost
belgian
like
scent
the
taste
is
good
also
yes
it
is
still
another
mexican
lager
but
it
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
there
is
a
zing
to
it
almost
like
someone
squeezed
some
fresh
lemon
into
it
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
it
drinks
well
and
is
really
quite
enjoyable
id
like
to
be
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summers
day
pale
gold
color
head
bubbles
up
quick
and
leaves
faster
after
a
couple
seconds
there
is
no
head
left
at
all
smells
of
grass
and
grain
has
a
sweet
corn
taste
that
is
very
thin
and
watery
not
good
at
all
this
just
adds
to
the
list
and
the
image
of
mexican
beers
as
being
subpar
its
drinkable
if
ice
cold
its
better
than
corona
thats
as
good
as
this
beer
gets
one
of
the
few
beers
that
makes
corona
look
like
a
premium
brand
hint
of
funky
plastic
in
the
aroma
and
more
in
the
taste
harsh
whallop
of
bitterness
hits
the
tongue
and
hangs
on
with
a
onedimensional
tenacity
that
makes
another
mouthtfull
a
dreaded
chore
simply
awful
overall
if
you
are
having
a
fiesta
on
the
weekend
serve
this
instead
of
corona
mexicans
actually
drink
it
and
it
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
i
am
not
a
fan
of
light
beers
overcarbonated
and
not
very
good
very
light
gold
color
medium
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
grassy
and
sweet
a
light
tasting
lager
very
light
malts
prevalent
lemony
flavor
not
very
appealing
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thin
finish
is
crisp
aftertaste
is
lemony
and
neutral
not
a
very
good
beer
id
have
to
say
that
this
one
tastes
a
lot
like
miller
lite
but
it
has
more
of
a
mouthdrying
effect
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
little
head
that
dies
quickly
the
aroma
is
boring
mass
produced
style
the
malts
are
slightly
detectable
in
the
flavor
and
the
carbonation
shows
itself
pretty
well
also
still
it
has
the
massproduct
taste
the
aftertaste
was
pretty
dry
not
a
favorite
ahh
pacifico
i
would
choose
this
beer
over
corona
every
single
time
and
i
dare
say
that
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
with
a
wedge
of
lime
squeezed
on
in
i
have
had
this
beer
plenty
of
times
over
the
years
in
numerous
mexican
restaurants
and
other
places
as
i
drink
i
am
thinking
about
cabo
san
lucas
and
lobster
dinners
on
the
beach
eating
with
your
feet
in
the
sand
on
a
beautiful
mexican
night
drinking
pacificos
bright
and
clear
fizzy
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
slightly
metallic
in
the
aroma
i
dont
remember
that
with
some
whiffs
of
grains
and
lemons
theres
a
sweetness
in
the
body
and
finishes
harshly
bitter
and
dry
if
this
beer
was
cheaper
i
would
probably
buy
more
of
it
but
once
and
awhile
is
fine
drinkability

imho
just
what
a
mexican
beer
should
be
lots
of
water
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
enough
taste
to
pass
for
cervesa
i
served
this
one
up
muy
frio

half
hour
in
the
freezer

made
sure
i
was
hot
and
tired
from
lots
of
yard
work
and
guzzled
it
after
the
tasting
drinks
notes
better
than
corona
who
cares
this
beer
poured
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
was
just
awful
the
hue
was
golden
and
there
was
carbonation
observed
the
mouthfeel
was
weak
and
watery
and
lacked
character
i
was
not
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
to
say
the
least
it
had
a
bitter
taste
to
it
as
well
an
an
aftertaste
that
lingered
taste
is
adequate
and
no
more
a
real
average
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
good
carbonation
helps
to
keep
the
slightly
sweet
taste
moving
minimal
hints
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
the
drinkability
is
fairly
high
seems
to
go
well
with
mexican
food
and
is
far
superior
to
the
other
beer
at
the
party
which
surprise
surprise
was
corona
a
very
decent
mexican
brew
this
poured
a
typical
straw
colour
and
had
a
minimal
head
smelled
of
grain
and
slightly
of
hops
served
very
cold
this
beer
is
good
a
definant
step
above
corona
and
quite
drinkable
with
mexican
dishes
this
brew
has
a
slight
skunkyness
to
it
though
but
it
does
not
come
out
too
bad
untill
it
warms
up
a
very
drinkable
mexican
beer
a
supermarket
grab
and
an
alternative
to
corona
poured
a
honey
color
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
died
before
i
finished
typing
this
sentence
smell
is
nothing
spectacular
grainy
malt
with
a
barely
detectable
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
not
too
bad
malt
overtones
dry
hop
finish
slightly
overbalanced
on
the
side
of
the
hops
carbonation
is
very
active
in
the
mouth
and
it
really
hits
the
tip
and
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
should
go
quite
well
with
burritos
tonight
not
a
great
beer
at
best
a
rather
ordinary
one
served
ice
cold
it
probably
is
okay
to
chase
down
some
spicy
beans
and
rice
with
this
lager

and
a
merging

but
this
argicultural
theme
is
very
restrained
this
bottle
was
not
skunky
as
much
as
the
aroma
and
appearance
are
of
little
note
they
are
the
most
distinctive
features
of
the
beer
sweet
start
very
little
at
the
close
medium
carbonation
pretty
close
to
tasteless
not

but
below
many
macros
in
impression

out

clear
and
bright
yellow
golden
colour
thin
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
nonexistant
aroma
maybe
a
hint
of
corn
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
virtually
not
there
either
is
this
beer
battles
corona
for
most
tasteless
mexican
brew
clean
and
smooth
and
with
hardly
a
hint
of
any
real
aftertaste
might
score
a
bit
higher
for
drinkability
for
easy
poundability
without
even
realizing
you
might
drinking
beer
either
that
or
it
would
make
for
a
good
tequila
chaser
or
a
cool
liquid
to
wash
down
spicy
mexican
food
otherwise
not
much
to
write
about
a
pretty
lame
beer
all
in
all
a
very
average
beer
better
than
corona
for
sure
and
the
brown
bottles
were
probably
a
lifesaver
for
this
beer
this
stuff
would
probably
be
rancid
if
skunked
if
served
very
cold
this
could
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
i
didnt
need
any
limes
to
cover
up
the
flavor
so
that
must
be
a
plus
there
are
a
lot
better
beers
out
there
that
are
less
expensive
as
well
ariba
good
drinkable
beer
for
mexican
texmex
parties
i
have
issues
giving
this
beer
a
bad
review
for
the
style
its
probably
one
of
the
best
i
drank
it
out
of
a
snifter
and
savored
what
there
were
of
flavors
which
may
not
have
been
the
best
way
to
review
this
beer
much
like
fine
belgian
beers
that
have
their
own
dedicated
glass
and
way
of
being
drunk
this
beer
was
meant
to
have
a
lime
stuck
in
it
and
drunk
straight
out
of
the
bottle
preferably
while
chillin
on
a
beach
in
mexico
this
beer
poured
a
very
very
pale
yellow
the
head
was
robust
and
stayed
on
the
glass
in
a
nice
lace
the
beer
was
very
clear
the
smell
well
there
was
none
i
had
to
give
them
a
couple
points
for
not
having
an
off
smell
the
taste
was
very
light
and
no
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
also
light
i
had
this
beer
at
a
mexican
restaurant
it
went
with
my
dinner
better
than
a
coke
it
provided
liquid
to
go
along
with
the
meal
before
i
review
this
beer
i
noticed
something
strange
about
all
of
the
bottles
in
this
sixer
they
all
look
like
lowfills
but
they
are
all
dead
even
on
the
level
hmmm
chinchy
or
what
pours
a
clear
pale
color
with
a
modest
white
sodalike
head
that
disappeared
rapidly
while
making
a
fizzy
noise
the
smell
consists
of
light
corn
an
earthy
grain
and
a
light
sweetness
not
too
enticing
the
flavor
mimics
the
aromas
with
a
light
carb
bite
to
boot
this
beer
should
be
considered
a
light
lager
with
its
watery
mouthfeel
not
a
good
beer
at
all
although
its
blandness
makes
for
a
slightly
better
than
average
drinker

good
either
i
tried
it
one
day
and
it
was
hohum
very
light
just
like
most
other
mexican
brews
that
are
mainstream
on
the
market
ie
corona
not
much
of
a
taste
mostly
of
water
with
a
smidge
of
hops
the
only
head
i
got
was
from
the
carbonation
salud
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
tastes
like
a
light
lager
with
a
pinch
of
skunk
a
mexican
light
flavored
lager
with
little
flavor
beyond
the
mild
skunkiness
i
would
not
recommend
this
stuff
unless
it
is
free
i
have
to
say
that
as
far
as
mexicans
beers
go
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
yet
to
rate
dos
xx
but
this
is
definitely
a
better
tasting
beer
than
corona
crisp
taste
straw
color
virtually
no
head
to
mention
goes
down
well
on
a
hot
day
i
would
recommend
it
over
any
of
the
popular
swilling
macrobrews
bud
miller
etc
beer
pours
a
translucent
bright
gold
and
the
head
modest
in
size
brilliantly
white
with
the
lace
thin
sheets
clinging
to
the
glass
malt
nose
crisp
and
clean
front
is
malt
the
top
cadaverous
finish
astringent
hops
awol
dry
aftertaste
drinkable
but
leaves
me
lost
in
space
danger
will
robinson
contagion
in
a
bottle
this
is
not
a
beer
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
again
this
brew
is
a
step
above
a
corona
pours
a
very
light
straw
with
very
little
head
that
leaves
no
lace
your
average
american
lager
style
brew
with
that
hint
of
mexican
skunk
piss
not
a
bad
brew
but
mexican
beers
are
not
my
cup
of
tea
a
friend
thought
he
was
being
nice
by
bringing
me
over
a
sixer
of
it
one
of
my
first
ventures
into
the
mexican
beer
world
corona
doesnt
count
i
found
it
to
be
a
pretty
good
and
drinkable
beer
i
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
with
the
lime
jammed
into
it
doesnt
compare
to
our
good
micros
but
on
a
hot
day
i
would
think
about
geting
it
again
maybe
ive
had
club
soda
that
had
more
of
everything
except
for
the
alcohol
no
untoward
flavors
or
skunk
but
on
the
other
hand
skunk
would
not
be
such
a
bad
thing
in
this
case
just
about
any
flavor
would
be
a
welcomed
change
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
not
bad
for
an
exotic
beer
and
definitely
better
than
corona
however
it
is
not
really
worth
drinking
unless
you
are
stranded
in
mexico
and
cant
pronounce
anything
else
it
is
not
too
bad
these
bad
boys
can
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
they
go
down
smooth
and
light
but
i
can
only
drink
one
if
i
really
feel
like
it
it
makes
an
occasional
appearance
in
my
tummy
better
than
corona
i
would
say
like
an
american
macrobrew
the
lack
of
protein
from
the
excessive
use
of
corn
andor
rice
as
adjuncts
prevents
any
head
retention
a
touch
of
dimethyl
sulfide
cooked
cabbage
in
aroma
w
just
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
hop
nose
is
absent
theres
a
bit
more
going
on
in
flavor
when
compared
to
budmillercoors
hop
bitterness
is
above
the
norm
and
cooked
corn
and
residual
malt
sweetness
is
thus
thankfully
masked
not
quite
as
thin
in
body
as
a
typical
macrobrew
but
quite
light
nonetheless
finishes
dry
and
bland
pacifico
is
a
notch
above
the
typical
domestic
lager
but
thats
not
saying
much
i
had
2
cold
bottles
at
my
buddies
house
hes
cuban
he
loves
the
stuff
and
i
agreed
to
give
it
a
try
nice
pour
golden
straw
color
clear
as
can
be
nice
head
nothing
to
note
aroma
wise
tasted
decent
enough
not
much
but
a
decent
lager
some
balance
but
mostly
watery
and
some
malt
i
thought
it
was
much
better
than
any
corona
i
have
had
i
would
order
this
at
a
mexican
restaurant
over
a
bud
miller
etc
eds
note
i
hour
later
serious
bad
belches
and
heartburn
wow
they
never
should
have
let
this
one
leave
mexico
its
seems
to
stick
to
the
tongue
which
is
unfortunate
because
its
got
a
pretty
nasty
taste
probably
a
bit
better
than
corona
but
that
doesnt
say
much
at
all
no
real
character
whatsoever
but
easy
to
drink
enjoy
overall
3
25
good
beer
i
am
sure
this
would
be
like
finding
an
oasis
in
the
desert
if
you
could
drink
one
or
more
of
these
on
a
hot
day
in
equatorial
africa
where
it
is
brewed
this
is
a
good
lager
and
not
everyone
is
fond
of
or
really
appreciates
a
lager
these
days
with
good
reason
regardless
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
and
worth
a
try
if
you
are
at
a
restaurant
or
at
a
beer
store
on
the
sweet
side
of
lagers
generally
average
beer
but
drinkable
nothing
to
hate
nothing
to
stand
out
very
good
creamy
smooth
pale
lager
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
white
head
cereal
grains
on
the
nose
follows
onto
the
palate
some
sweetness
on
the
palate
as
well
finishes
with
a
typical
lager
finish
lightly
sweet
final
thoughts
i
honestly
did
not
expect
this
beer
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
this
one
was
not
another
tried
one
lager
tried
them
all
as
there
were
enough
unique
aspects
to
this
one
that
made
me
appreciate
the
nuance
is
it
worth
the
cost
of
importing
yeah
id
say
just
barely
im
gonna
give
it
a
thumb
up
give
it
a
shot
sweet
edge
that
does
not
become
pervasive
citric
fruitiness
as
an
underlying
flavor
that
adds
a
nice
character
that
differentiates
tusker
from
other
lagers
nothing
standout
but
enjoyable
like
the
overall
taste
and
the
look
overall
there
is
nothing
amazing
going
on
with
this
lager
it
is
not
the
worst
adjunct
lager
i
have
tasted
but
it
is
not
the
best
either
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
will
not
go
looking
for
it
nice
and
subtle
on
the
tongue
good
beer
here
aroma
was
grainy
biscuit
ricecorn
smells
bland
and
very
much
like
an
adjunct
lager
there
was
a
very
slight
earthy
hop
character
and
it
took
on
a
slight
tang
as
it
warmed
it
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
and
it
had
a
body
that
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
water
and
got
something
light
to
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
level
taste
was
boring
that
blandness
really
carried
through
to
the
palate
grainy
biscuit
from
the
malt
subtle
earthy
hop
but
mostly
a
whole
lotta
nothin
its
just
not
a
good
beer
if
this
is
the
style
im
going
for
i
might
as
well
be
handed
a
bud
light
smooth
lager
poured
from
a
bottle
no
head
but
minimal
lacing
clean
with
no
after
taste
this
is
just
a
nice
change
of
pace
very
pale
in
color
and
certainly
with
a
hint
of
adjuncts
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
neutral
with
sufficient
carbonation
overall
nothing
particularly
special
but
certainly
worth
a
try
given
a
selection
of
lagers
from
various
areas
that
included
this
i
would
definitely
recommend
tusker
as
a
solid
choice
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
and
very
much
native
to
kenya
one
can
find
it
everywhere
in
kenya
and
comes
darn
cheap
500
ml
bottles
of
the
tusker
are
sold
at
us1
for
the
price
its
a
bargain
being
a
lager
it
is
quite
smooth
and
light
one
can
definitely
swap
water
for
a
tusker
any
day
o
pretty
decent
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
if
it
was
the
only
thing
around
o
just
another
adjunct
lager
jaal
this
time
from
africa
overall
a
simple
easy
drinking
american
adjunct
nothing
really
stands
out
here
from
other
american
adjuncts
this
brew
would
be
good
after
doing
some
yardwork
im
surprised
at
how
tasty
this
was
o
great
for
an
african
beer
again
cool
bottle
and
label
and
unique
coming
from
africa
this
was
my
first
beer
ever
at
the
university
of
guelph
years
ago
nice
to
have
found
it
again
today
in
port
perry
on
o
drinkable
and
not
that
bad
for
an
adjunct
lager
still
drinkable
enough
to
enjoy
it
tusker
poured
a
very
clear
yellowgold
colour
with
plenty
of
rising
bubbles
visible
pouring
produced
about
1
5
of
pure
white
head
that
lasted
for
several
minutes
leaving
a
considerable
amount
of
lacing
all
down
the
far
side
of
the
glass
its
aroma
is
quite
simple
bready
light
malts
and
not
much
of
anything
else
the
beers
flavour
begins
with
a
fleeting
light
malt
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
very
very
subtle
hop
bitterness
and
no
aftertaste
despite
the
quantity
of
visible
bubbles
i
found
the
carbonation
to
be
quite
light
and
i
would
describe
the
mouthfeel
as
light
and
watery
i
guess
this
makes
sense
if
i
was
living
in
an
african
climate
i
probably
wouldnt
be
looking
for
a
hefty
porter
or
stout
the
good
news
my
first
african
beer
was
drinkable
the
not
so
good
i
found
tusker
to
be
too
light
in
aroma
flavour
and
body
for
my
particular
taste
though
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
i
doubt
that
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
tusker
was
selling
for
3
35
per
500
ml
bottle
at
the
time
or
writing
this
beer
pours
light
golden
with
light
head
and
had
average
carbonation
it
has
little
to
no
aroma
its
has
the
tastes
of
fruits
hops
vegetables
and
goes
down
fairly
easy
it
finishes
dirty
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
is
no
better
than
the
average
domestic
pale
lager
i
wanted
to
like
this
will
try
again
but
too
watery
and
nondescript
stella
is
better
pour
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
decent
sized
tightly
bubbled
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
faint
cap
on
top
aromas
of
sweet
grainy
honey
like
pilsner
malt
and
a
faint
floral
hop
im
a
bit
surprised
that
the
aroma
is
so
damn
inviting
the
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
and
honey
like
with
some
faint
earthy
spicy
hop
to
balance
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
slick
sugary
water
mouthfeel
very
nice
example
of
a
pale
lager
i
could
see
some
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
o
i
can
see
how
this
would
be
refreshing
in
its
native
climate
but
then
again
id
probably
chug
any
beer
you
put
in
front
of
me
while
the
hot
african
sun
was
beating
down
me
a
pretty
average
euro
feeling
lager
in
every
respect
it
has
a
nice
african
history
tradition
nevertheless
is
not
even
a
superior
adjunct
lager
i
would
pass
aroma
isnt
very
strong
but
appealing
too
bad
the
flavor
is
rather
diffused
and
weak
okay
overall
makes
for
a
decent
thirst
quencher
but
wont
do
much
for
you
if
youre
seeking
memorable
taste
overall
very
mediocre
to
almost
poor
weve
all
had
this
beer
before
and
its
pretty
much
the
reason
why
many
of
us
are
so
obsessive
about
craft
beer
we
want
a
beer
that
tastes
like
something
this
doesnt
you
can
pass
on
it
o
an
expensive
pbr
i
have
a
fond
memory
of
this
beer
from
college
but
upon
a
real
reflection
of
it
i
realize
that
it
just
isnt
that
great
of
a
brew
i
think
ill
pass
on
it
next
time
i
see
one
and
leave
that
memory
mostly
untarnished
o
not
very
interesting
to
be
sure
but
as
far
as
macro
lagers
go
this
one
is
actually
kind
of
good
import
prices
kill
any
chance
of
me
buying
this
again
in
merica
though
o
a
nonoffensive
beer
that
is
bland
and
has
no
character
i
likely
wont
buy
a
bottle
of
this
again
but
it
was
basically
what
i
expected
would
come
out
of
a
hot
place
like
kenya
a
refreshing
and
not
intensely
flavoured
lager
but
pleasantly
not
full
of
adjuncts
nice
work
at
making
a
good
adjunct
lager
where
the
adjuncts
are
not
the
first
thing
you
notice
atmosphere
is
decent
light
hue
nice
head
and
thick
lacing
nose
is
pungent
and
nutty
pale
and
washed
out
malt
with
a
synthetic
sweetsoapy
palate
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
quaff
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
nothing
special
here
just
a
typical
adjunct
lager
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
too
bad
the
beer
wasnt
better
pours
a
clear
straw
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
rice
hint
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
sorghum
fits
the
style
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
slight
dryness
tastes
of
rice
pale
malt
hint
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
sorghum
overall
decent
appearance
but
otherwise
average
at
best
in
all
other
categories
o
refreshing
enough
middle
of
the
road
but
very
acceptable
and
happy
to
see
kenya
producing
a
decent
brew
i
can
drink
it
again
o
this
is
just
what
the
body
needed
if
you
find
yourself
in
the
same
situation
pass
on
the
kilimanjaro
lager
and
have
this
instead
the
best
youll
get
in
the
area
rjt
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
faint
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
grassy
wheat
flavor
is
light
slightly
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
finishes
rather
dry
and
abruptly
leaving
a
slightly
mineral
aftertaste
light
bodied
a
very
bland
and
lightly
flavored
lager
with
no
off
flavors
but
nothing
really
to
recommend
it
at
least
i
can
tick
kenya
without
flying
thousands
of
miles
for
this
overall
nothing
extremely
special
probably
about
right
for
a
typical
lager
with
an
extra
point
or
two
for
not
tasting
skunky
and
id
guess
when
having
a
fresh
bottle
in
the
country
it
originates
from
it
would
be
very
thirst
quenching
and
agreeable
o
decent
light
lager
i
doubt
ill
ever
find
myself
in
kenya
but
if
i
do
id
probably
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
drinkable
yes
collectible
maybe
for
he
bottle
o
comparing
to
other
foreign
lagers
excellent
not
worth
the
3
49
a
bottle
but
still
very
good
average
lager
that
has
better
than
average
flavor
and
they
do
it
better
then
the
macros
here
overall
nothing
too
special
about
the
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
bad
the
website
says
all
of
the
ingredients
are
sourced
in
africa
which
is
pretty
cool
id
say
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
im
glad
i
can
say
ive
tried
something
from
africa
but
probably
wont
seek
this
out
again
overall
drinkability
despite
not
being
much
to
look
its
still
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
i
could
easily
have
another
its
a
simple
and
unassuming
beer
and
it
goes
quite
well
with
food
to
wash
it
down
fish
tacos
in
my
case
i
suspect
it
would
go
quite
well
with
highly
spicy
african
food
as
well
to
counter
the
fire
and
heavy
flavor
from
that
type
of
food
glad
i
tried
it
i
really
liked
the
fact
that
they
still
reuse
the
bottles
not
crush
melt
and
make
a
new
bottle
like
in
the
us
i
didnt
find
this
a
very
flavorful
beer
but
what
flavor
it
did
have
was
nice
it
is
a
decent
beer
for
those
hot
summer
nights
i
wouldnt
bother
trying
to
save
a
lot
of
luggage
space
to
bring
some
back
maybe
a
bottle
or
two
good
on
a
hot
day
not
offensive
and
pretty
refreshing
but
not
terribly
inspiring
another
bottle
ive
been
drinking
pale
yellow
fizzy
adjunct
lagers
for
basically
a
decade
now
and
as
with
my
original
review
i
still
feel
tusker
is
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
tried
the
only
issue
its
just
too
expensive
to
be
worth
it
if
money
were
no
object
then
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
summer
beer
fridge
but
until
then
i
probably
wont
bother
frequently
o
its
actually
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
it
has
some
taste
or
it
is
mildly
pleasing
o
for
as
bad
the
score
im
giving
it
it
is
actually
fairly
drinkable
it
would
be
hard
not
to
be
considering
it
is
so
watery
people
mention
sweet
water
i
didnt
taste
no
sweetness
just
water
o
this
was
a
pretty
forgettable
lager
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
but
nothing
i
would
grab
again
although
i
am
pretty
sure
this
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
in
africa
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
like
this
i
just
dont
dig
it
overall
this
was
a
terrible
larger
it
was
undrinkable
and
the
smell
was
truely
awful
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
maybe
i
havent
had
an
adjunct
lager
in
awhile
but
this
was
a
decent
drink
no
offflavors
or
bad
smell
d
as
far
as
an
adjunct
lagers
go
this
one
is
okay
good
nose
and
flavor
considering
what
little
there
is
to
start
with
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
due
to
the
light
flavors
smell
and
abv
but
honestly
im
not
sure
that
i
would
really
want
to
drink
many
of
these
or
have
it
again
i
prefer
a
little
more
flavor
and
something
a
little
more
interesting
o
hey
not
bad
man
would
tusker
be
a
gold
medal
award
winner
at
international
monde
selection
if
it
were
carbonation
could
use
a
boost
i
think
it
would
help
a
bit
but
not
too
much
bubbles
as
they
would
detract
from
the
flavors
at
last
an
african
beer
slowly
my
list
is
being
completed
but
will
it
be
done
before
my
liver
and
my
life
is
doubtful
at
least
when
i
meet
st
peter
ill
be
able
to
say
take
me
or
leave
me
i
drank
an
african
brew
bitch
so
anyway
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
from
the
dark
continent
was
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
the
one
finger
of
white
head
fizzed
out
rather
quickly
and
only
a
few
streaks
of
sticky
lacing
remained
to
show
for
it
the
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
with
an
unexpected
note
of
berries
as
well
as
sweet
malt
some
rice
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
flavors
were
drier
than
the
aroma
suggested
but
still
pleasant
enough
and
appropriate
for
the
style
i
tasted
biscuity
malt
the
sweet
berrylike
malt
and
the
floral
hops
at
the
end
all
of
these
notes
were
subtle
and
in
general
i
would
describe
the
beer
as
understated
and
yet
it
was
altogether
pleasant
and
in
no
way
offensive
unlike
many
adjunct
lagers
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
soft
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
would
no
doubt
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
as
im
sure
it
was
intended
furthermore
i
think
its
worth
noting
this
was
one
of
the
best
adjunct
lagers
ive
ever
tasted
a
gem
and
an
oddity
like
that
girl
i
dated
in
vt
with
truly
tremendous
assets
this
specimen
proved
to
be
the
best
kind
of
novelty
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
and
very
good
for
the
style
definitely
a
thirst
quencher
perfect
for
a
hot
day
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
average
lacing
and
carbonation
the
nose
is
skunk
grain
and
slight
malt
fairly
disappointing
even
for
the
style
taste
is
actually
average
for
the
style
its
not
too
sweet
got
a
decent
malt
background
and
is
not
bad
for
a
aal
feel
is
light
undercarbonated
with
good
malt
bill
overall
a
better
choice
than
some
others
in
the
style
but
i
wont
seek
this
out
again
notes
not
anything
spectacular
but
if
you
want
a
quick
beer
to
drink
quick
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
will
do
the
job
cheers
pours
a
very
light
yellow
color
that
is
clear
with
a
slight
head
very
similar
looking
to
miller
lite
scent
has
some
slight
grassy
tones
mixed
with
wheat
taste
is
what
you
can
expect
from
an
adjunct
lager
the
taste
reminds
me
a
lot
of
red
stripe
and
red
dog
it
does
however
have
a
little
thicker
texture
and
a
quite
crisp
finish
i
enjoyed
trying
a
beer
from
a
different
country
but
this
was
a
rather
ordinary
tasting
beer
12oz
bottle
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
small
short
lived
white
head
aroma
and
taste
of
cereal
and
grains
light
malty
notes
and
light
hops
bitterness
light
body
with
soda
like
carbonation
and
watery
mouth
feel
finish
is
cereal
grains
sweet
light
bitterness
ending
with
a
watery
bland
and
metalic
flavor
overall
not
much
to
say
did
not
like
this
could
not
finish
drinking
this
beer
would
not
reccomend
o
very
simple
adjunct
lager
not
much
was
expected
and
this
lager
proved
to
be
just
that
i
would
not
recommend
it
onot
bad
but
for
2
99
for
a
12oz
bottle
i
think
i
would
rather
drink
bmc
for
0
50
a
can
and
not
have
the
floaties
o
its
not
worse
than
many
adjunct
lagers
but
its
not
much
better
either
wouldnt
seek
out
again
o
not
a
horrible
adjunct
lager
but
not
very
good
either
certainly
not
at
the
price
of
2
50
a
bottle
i
admittedly
bought
this
as
a
bit
of
a
novelty
having
never
had
an
african
brewed
beer
and
really
liking
the
cap
to
add
to
the
collection
that
being
said
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
sure
mildly
clouded
pale
straw
yellow
very
fizzy
head
like
a
soft
drink
that
goes
away
completely
in
an
instant
no
lacing
smells
like
a
malt
with
lots
of
sweet
corn
adjuncts
and
strange
metallic
odors
some
earthytype
noble
hops
but
not
very
strong
taste
includes
more
of
the
annoying
metallic
presence
some
sweet
malts
completely
out
of
balance
with
the
faint
attempt
at
hopping
mouthfeel
is
overly
watery
and
not
very
satisfying
at
all
im
probably
never
going
to
visit
this
one
ever
again
i
do
not
recommend
it
too
similar
to
any
other
bmc
to
justify
the
price
i
would
not
move
to
africa
just
to
get
this
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
decent
brew
light
honey
color
and
sublime
hoppiness
clean
rereshing
taste
but
a
bit
middle
of
the
road
then
again
the
style
of
pale
lager
itself
is
middle
of
the
road
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
it
goes
down
smooth
though
and
fast
ideal
for
a
hot
day
when
flavor
might
take
a
back
seat
to
refreshment
but
very
average
otherwise
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
small
12
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
broken
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
grain
corn
flakes
and
slight
buttered
bread
taste
is
of
sweet
grain
light
fruit
flavors
and
some
slight
citrus
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
and
my
first
beer
ever
from
africa
i
am
impressed
with
this
one
to
be
quite
honest
t
pretty
similar
to
the
smell
lots
of
grain
some
butter
corn
yeast
and
a
bit
of
malt
not
exactly
a
clean
finish
kind
of
a
lingering
yeasty
flavor
at
the
end
yuck
overall
if
i
had
just
climbed
kilimanjaro
i
could
drink
it
sitting
in
a
comfortable
chair
in
my
room
no
translucent
yellow
with
no
head
only
a
small
ring
around
the
glass
light
and
sweet
grainy
corn
and
some
hay
in
the
nose
flavor
is
crisp
and
sweet
however
it
is
grainy
and
bland
the
finish
has
a
mild
amount
of
carbonation
which
leaves
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
no
hops
are
evident
it
was
descent
nothing
exciting
id
drink
it
over
any
macro
o
not
a
bad
beer
again
judging
according
to
the
style
light
and
refreshing
no
offflavors
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
might
not
seek
it
out
though
worth
a
try

d
didnt
expect
much
from
this
and
thats
what
i
got
not
as
bad
as
a
lot
of
swill
though
poured
into
a
standard
water
glass
in
djibouti
nice
golden
straw
appearance
clear
and
provided
some
head
and
mild
lacing
nice
skunky
aroma
like
some
european
or
german
lagers
actually
flavour
was
better
than
expected
some
breadiness
some
mild
bitterness
and
some
mild
metallic
taste
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
in
east
africa
overall
a
very
average
lager
but
would
drink
again
if
the
situation
arises
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
had
a
tusker
whilst
visitng
the
tusker
restaurant
in
the
animal
kingdom
of
walt
disney
tusker
lagar
has
a
clear
golden
color
with
decent
carbonation
which
provided
a
nice
white
foamy
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
powered
by
grain
but
there
is
an
interesting
taste
as
it
comes
off
the
pallete
not
sure
if
that
is
a
malt
that
they
are
using
or
not
the
beer
is
easy
on
teh
mouth
and
is
best
suited
to
be
drank
on
hot
summer
days
overall
this
is
a
really
refreshing
beer
and
i
can
imagine
that
its
incredibly
satisfying
on
a
hot
kenyan
afternoon
if
this
was
slightly
cheaper
id
drink
it
all
the
time
in
the
summer
not
surprised
the
pour
resulted
in
a
finger
of
dense
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
really
light
yellow
so
light
that
it
made
me
think
that
i
have
passed
darker
urine
neplus
quality
clarity
in
that
i
could
see
into
the
future
with
this
one
nose
had
a
very
cerealsilagecooked
vegetable
scent
and
i
was
not
terribly
surprised
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
unexpected
blandness
in
the
mouth
this
was
almost
like
drinking
water
in
terms
of
its
lack
of
taste
finish
was
equally
bland
and
boring
it
was
not
bad
just
unimpressive
o
overall
not
a
bad
adjunct
lager
while
im
not
really
a
fan
of
this
style
at
all
im
glad
i
got
to
try
an
african
beer
wouldnt
buy
it
again
though
o
overall
i
wasnt
entirely
impressed
but
not
turned
off
this
is
actually
the
first
african
beer
ive
ever
had
so
im
looking
forward
to
exploring
other
flavours
and
styles
o
african
coors
pretty
much
albeit
a
little
more
interesting
sweet
and
appealing
not
a
great
beer
but
still
a
pleasant
and
refreshing
beverage
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
and
better
than
the
average
beer
in
this
category
it
was
a
little
bit
on
the
pricey
side
for
what
it
is
but
id
still
probably
buy
it
again
this
poured
just
like
any
other
lager
would
a
yellowish
gold
with
a
good
head
at
first
that
faded
quickly
the
aroma
had
some
hints
of
citrus
to
me
not
really
sure
where
that
was
coming
from
but
it
sparked
my
interest
the
taste
was
basically
like
most
lagers
out
there
this
brew
wasnt
too
bad
but
it
wasnt
anything
overly
special
either
not
awful
but
not
amazing
if
you
have
the
chance
its
not
bad
when
compared
to
other
beers
its
a
mediocre
adjunct
lager
but
not
bad
for
a
lighter
beer
and
refreshing
worth
it
just
to
try
a
beer
from
kenya
all
in
all
this
isnt
a
beer
to
avoid
at
all
costs
but
its
nothing
to
get
your
hopes
up
about
either
its
designed
like
i
said
to
appeal
to
the
highest
number
of
people
so
a
lot
of
the
qualities
that
could
make
it
stand
out
are
diluted
that
said
im
sure
africa
has
better
beers
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
considering
where
it
is
mostly
consumed
a
perfect
brew
for
hot
climates
to
quench
thirst
very
light
and
smooth
therefore
very
drinkable
over
all
a
interesting
different
kind
of
beer
dthe
offtaste
that
i
experienced
made
this
very
difficult
to
stick
with
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
pale
lager
im
guessing
this
stuff
needs
to
be
sampled
fresh
and
then
it
would
be
a
passable
light
lager
but
this
bottle
is
awful
a
bit
uneventful
its
rather
bland
this
probably
goes
down
better
in
a
hot
climate
where
you
want
something
refreshing
but
it
doesnt
do
much
for
me
dokay
for
the
style
the
style
is
just
not
great
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
get
it
with
african
food
what
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
very
clean
crisp
and
flavorful
for
the
style
overall
not
bad
this
beer
seems
similar
to
spanish
style
lagers
and
gets
my
better
than
budweiser
approval
unfortunetly
the
price
doesnt
match
up
with
the
taste
kinda
cool
to
say
you
have
drink
a
beer
made
in
kenya
but
its
not
2
99
worth
of
beer
domestic
brewerys
make
way
better
lagers
for
a
lot
cheaper
mainly
paying
for
importing
price
taste
is
very
light
starts
sharp
dry
and
sparkly
and
ends
corn
sweet
and
metallic
lawnmower
drinkable
tempered
the
spicy
sauce
that
went
with
the
african
food
i
was
enjoying
not
surprising
in
any
way
fine
so
long
as
you
have
appropriate
expectations
d
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
it
is
a
good
african
beer
overall
when
we
were
drinking
this
brew
we
kept
saying
apple
juice
it
packs
a
light
punch
in
the
flavor
department
and
the
overwhelming
carbonation
leaves
the
drinker
somewhat
burpy
and
unsatisfied
while
the
american
adjuct
lager
is
not
by
any
means
one
of
my
top
favorite
styles
i
have
to
say
this
beer
wears
on
me
with
each
pull
it
seems
to
get
a
bit
better
that
being
said
its
hard
to
rate
the
drinkability
anything
less
than
good
d
for
what
it
is
its
not
all
that
bad
and
pretty
much
fits
the
style
its
a
decent
tasting
lager
thats
refreshing
if
you
havent
had
an
african
beer
yet
this
is
one
to
try

maybe
im
a
little
late
on
this
bottle
poured
into
a
tall
clear
glass
proud
puffy
multifinger
head
extremely
pale
yellow
color
light
aroma
of
hops
and
barley
very
watery
with
little
carbonation
very
simple
tasting
character
not
much
flavor
or
taste
just
basic
thirst
quenching
stuff
very
innocuous
brew
that
could
probably
fit
in
very
well
with
other
tv
beers
id
rather
drink
tusker
than
those
any
day
very
simple
stuff
here
try
it
for
the
novelty
but
not
much
else
clear
light
yellow
brew
is
extremely
fizzy
tons
of
carbonation
on
the
glass
a
fizzy
white
head
fizzles
out
in
a
matter
of
seconds
smell
is
practically
nonexistent
just
a
little
adjunct
sweetness
feel
has
mostly
settled
down
certainly
didnt
hold
its
fizz
it
went
from
explosive
to
nearly
flat
in
about
3
minutes
taste
is
mild
adjunct
sweetness
maybe
a
little
muddy
hop
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
interesting
either
surprise
present
from
my
dad
i
saw
that
it
was
a
kenyan
lager
and
i
almost
didnt
even
want
to
try
it
being
the
ticker
that
i
am
i
gave
it
a
shot
and
this
is
exactly
why
we
dont
judge
a
beer
by
its
location
appearance
nothing
to
note
aroma
is
light
and
sweet
corn
but
youd
expect
tons
of
skunk
and
none
is
present
the
aroma
is
light
and
sweet
not
at
all
a
typical
lager
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
exceeds
expectations
for
a
lager
and
a
kenyan
beer
beer
is
thin
and
clean
in
the
palate
not
much
sweetness
or
anything
no
aftertaste
drinkability
is
fine
but
its
kind
of
boring
drinkability
with
its
inoffensive
flavor
and
light
body
its
pretty
quaffable
throw
in
its
great
aroma
and
general
sessionableness
and
i
find
it
quite
drinkable
d
the
beer
goes
down
much
too
easily
this
is
the
perfect
lawnmower
beer
its
great
if
youre
looking
for
something
very
light
on
a
hot
summer
day
that
actually
has
some
flavor
drinkability
overall
quality
appears
poor
drinking
the
beer
gives
little
worth
noting
would
not
drink
regularly
overall
a
bad
beer
its
balanced
but
just
has
a
lack
of
overall
quality
not
recommended
drinkability
no
wonder
hemingway
drank
it
for
breakfast
tusker
stands
out
on
its
own
damn
good
lager
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
which
is
good
for
a
kenyan
beer
however
at
6
a
pop
poolside
in
disney
it
will
be
my
last
drinkability
really
there
are
worse
lagers
out
there
highly
drinkable
smooth
and
sweet
easy
to
chug
down
and
enjoy
comments
a
lager
that
surprised
me
a
little
i
did
not
expect
much
but
this
beer
did
leave
me
believing
i
may
have
missed
something
about
it
however
in
the
end
a
runofthemill
lager
pours
a
very
pale
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
aroma
of
grass
and
sour
apples
i
did
not
like
light
flavor
the
taste
has
a
little
sweet
malt
and
lemon
and
some
more
of
that
sour
apple
body
is
quite
thin
typical
for
a
lager
not
completely
undrinkable
but
not
something
id
buy
again
d
much
better
than
the
big
american
ones
not
much
flavor
or
anything
but
its
not
overly
sweet
and
it
doesnt
have
that
nasty
adjunct
aftertaste
very
clean
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
these
pale
lagers
and
maybe
that
because
the
only
ones
i
drink
are
the
macro
brews
so
if
there
are
some
good
pale
lagers
out
there
then
i
am
just
not
aware
of
them
but
this
beer
is
a
slightly
better
version
that
any
of
the
main
macro
brews
if
you
only
like
macro
brews
then
you
can
drink
this
to
make
yourself
look
cultured
smooth
and
drinkable
but
unfortunately
not
great
tasting
finding
a
superfresh
bottle
would
have
to
be
ideal
for
this
beer
its
pretty
much
kenyas
answer
to
the
macro
lager
theyve
done
a
better
job
however
you
pay
for
that
and
the
whole
its
from
kenya
thing
on
the
occasion
of
my
200th
review
ive
opted
for
my
first
african
brew
hailing
from
the
southern
portion
of
the
horn
tusker
looks
droopyesque
all
sad
and
unappealing
with
its
runofthemill
sallow
color
and
foamy
white
head
frankly
if
i
saw
an
elephant
looking
like
this
id
be
afeared
of
cathcing
some
newfangled
elephant
flu
the
high
compliments
dont
end
there
as
the
smell
though
intriguing
is
generally
offputtingly
sour
now
im
not
tslking
gueuze
or
flanders
red
here
but
just
a
subtle
faint
funk
the
rest
of
the
smell
is
very
hohum
rice
corn
wheat
oh
my
how
boring
and
aal
of
it
which
reminds
me
why
do
so
many
nonamerican
countries
seemingly
exclusively
brew
up
aals
i
guess
its
efficient
and
cheap
and
whatnot
but
still
what
would
be
nice
would
be
a
new
and
different
take
on
the
aal
but
no
its
all
the
same
old
song
here
just
with
a
different
label
from
where
its
from
the
temps
didnt
like
that
version
of
the
song
corn
syrup
rice
cake
and
vague
wheat
somber
the
proceedings
the
way
the
big
3
have
for
decades
a
slight
tin
flavor
makes
things
extra
disappointing
apparently
in
keeping
with
tradition
the
light
body
moderate
carbonation
and
watery
feel
are
all
maintained
in
accordance
with
the
bmc
neutrality
laws
at
least
you
can
just
pound
it
down
right
all
the
better
to
get
to
your
next
brew
appears
clear
straw
gold
with
a
short
white
head
with
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
and
slightly
metallic
with
a
hint
of
bread
and
corn
the
flavor
has
a
touch
of
sweet
candy
white
bread
crust
and
an
mild
offputting
tang
which
really
is
normal
for
the
style
in
the
summer
heat
this
would
make
for
a
respectable
lager
to
wash
down
brats
and
beat
the
heat
d
this
one
surprised
me
im
not
a
fan
of
the
american
adjunct
style
of
brewing
but
if
i
did
have
to
drink
it
i
think
i
would
choose
tusker
this
has
been
a
pleasant
surprise
from
a
country
that
i
didnt
think
would
surprise
me
drinkability
was
good
as
the
beer
had
no
serious
negatives
a
good
lager
but
as
with
most
lagers
damned
with
faint
praise
notes
overall
this
is
your
basic
pale
thin
hot
weather
lager
it
was
clean
drinkable
and
well
boring
anyway
i
can
now
say
that
i
have
had
a
beer
from
the
continent
of
africa
tuskers
lager
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
pale
grainy
malt
with
a
bit
of
sour
apple
the
flavor
is
just
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
with
more
sour
apple
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
this
beer
may
be
past
its
prime
but
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
with
no
freshness
date
a
pretty
standard
lager
but
not
bad
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
its
a
clear
slightly
warm
pale
yellow
colour
with
a
small
foamy
white
head
and
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
is
lightly
lemon
scented
with
a
sweet
almost
marshmellow
candyfloss
sat
behind
the
taste
is
creamy
and
buttery
upfront
not
what
i
was
expecting
there
is
a
sweet
caramel
edge
to
it
with
a
slight
floral
hoppy
finish
its
an
interesting
taste
but
i
really
like
it
well
worth
a
try
d
the
sweet
honey
flavor
of
the
malts
make
this
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
i
can
see
myself
having
this
with
ethiopian
food
this
kenyan
brew
poured
up
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
good
retentive
lacing
on
my
glassy
poo
the
aroma
was
pretty
plain
jane
sweet
corn
malts
the
taste
was
also
sweet
corn
malts
a
lil
bitter
hop
finish
lingering
on
my
black
tongue
pretty
full
bodied
brew
with
moderate
carbo
if
i
lived
in
an
african
desert
this
beer
would
be
bomb
but
thank
god
i
live
in
america
where
i
can
fart
away
my
whole
day
and
drink
waaay
better
beers
not
shabby
tho
i
learned
a
big
lesson
in
not
making
assumptions
as
to
where
a
beer
is
brewed
i
will
definitely
try
beers
from
other
places
that
you
dont
think
of
typically
for
their
beers
not
too
bad
probably
would
be
quite
good
in
the
summer
a
bit
thin
nothing
too
exciting
about
it
but
it
did
the
trick
and
wasnt
offensive
golden
yellow
with
a
white
bubbly
head
metalic
canned
vegetable
skunk
smell
not
great
clean
dry
grainy
taste
a
fair
amoutnt
of
bitterness
with
light
carbonation
not
much
from
the
malts
more
of
a
hard
metalic
grain
than
anything
some
skunk
in
the
aftertaste
that
reminded
me
of
red
stripe
light
crisp
bubbly
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
recomend
going
out
of
your
way
for
this
not
the
worst
thing
ever
but
the
flavors
just
arent
very
good
this
would
probably
be
one
that
grows
on
you
im
sure
the
fifth
one
would
be
much
better
than
the
first
drinkablity
much
better
than
expected
a
good
brew
from
a
far
away
land
i
never
expected
to
try
a
beer
from
kenya
d
a
good
lager
for
what
it
is
i
remember
drinking
this
under
the
shadow
of
mt
kilimanjaroit
quenched
by
thirst
in
the
hot
equitorial
sun
then
and
it
does
the
same
today
a
good
lager
when
all
is
said
and
done
not
what
i
expect
from
kenya
this
beer
is
bland
and
boring
but
better
than
most
macro
lagers
its
a
dull
yelllow
beer
clear
as
a
bell
with
a
thin
white
dissipating
head
my
new
sn
hop
tulip
is
actually
keeping
some
head
on
the
beer
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
simple
but
without
any
real
fault
the
flavor
is
a
lemony
sugar
malt
its
a
quite
refreshing
beer
id
certainly
be
happier
with
this
beer
than
most
in
the
style
pours
light
clear
gold
with
a
big
white
head
aroma
is
cereal
sweet
breads
corn
very
muted
flavor
is
mainly
corny
sweetness
with
pilsenerish
grains
some
hay
and
zero
hops
sticky
and
not
refreshing
about
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
kenya
pale
lager
really
tastes
like
a
beer
you
dont
even
notice
youre
drinking
not
necessarily
what
i
usually
look
for
in
a
beer
but
i
have
to
admit
itd
be
easy
to
drink
back
these
babies
all
night
fairly
easy
drinking
but
too
bland
to
provide
more
than
a
refreshing
palate
cleanser
sweet
and
slick
the
diacetyl
is
somewhat
overbearing
here
buttery
with
a
smattering
of
cooked
vegetables
and
frozen
white
corn
almost
crisp
but
the
buttery
slickness
really
impairs
both
the
flavor
and
texture
finishes
sweet
grainy
corny
this
is
actually
quite
bad
a
barely
decent
enough
tipple
for
the
style
as
transposed
across
a
few
continents
and
an
ocean
or
so
meaning
that
being
an
interesting
thing
to
try
from
east
africa
trumps
overtly
rejecting
it
as
the
same
shit
produced
in
the
western
world
i
dont
know
where
to
justify
that
particular
piece
of
commercial
and
geopolitical
bullshit
but
im
not
about
to
grab
another
of
these
all
the
same
as
our
native
african
friends
conquer
the
world
their
brew
and
other
food
items
seem
to
follow
them
honestly
i
am
not
an
enthousiast
of
african
cuisine
actually
one
of
the
3
most
horrible
culinary
experience
was
in
a
nigerian
restaurant
in
london
and
as
a
fact
i
will
neither
become
an
enthousiast
of
african
brews
this
one
smells
and
tastes
rather
odd
grenadine
paired
with
motor
oil
and
valerian
at
least
the
label
is
quite
interesting
tusker
does
not
have
the
flavour
and
character
of
many
other
beers
of
different
styles
but
it
is
an
ok
lager
particularly
compared
to
the
domestic
macrobrews
it
is
not
something
to
rave
over
but
it
is
ok
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
very
cold
on
a
hot
day
had
at
the
demera
ethiopian
restaurant
in
chicago
fortunately
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
skunkiness
referred
to
in
other
reviews
and
found
this
to
be
a
pleasant
drinkable
beer
clean
and
crisp
and
very
userfriendly
dont
know
what
this
retails
for
but
it
was
6
for
the
12ounce
bottle
at
the
restaurant
and
this
accompanied
the
tasty
food
nicely
so
the
blandness
continues
in
the
taste
is
it
bud
is
it
miller
it
could
be
thin
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
wheres
the
hop
the
brewer
must
have
waved
it
over
the
kettle
without
letting
fall
in
if
you
like
corn
in
your
beer
this
should
serve
you
well
drinlability
weve
got
a
winner
here
this
satisfies
very
well
when
youre
thirsty
and
you
could
pound
a
few
litres
of
this
away
without
getting
messy
i
would
go
for
this
whenever
convenient
to
do
so
recommended
poured
from
bottle
into
an
ale
glass
i
know
transparent
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
short
lived
finer
of
foam
good
clean
taste
is
above
average
for
an
american
style
lager
nice
mouthfeel
with
slight
residual
carbonation
above
average
drinkability
drinkability
is
great
im
really
kicking
myself
for
not
getting
a
6
pack
of
this
especially
when
i
though
to
myself
this
is
gona
suck
awesome
light
beer
give
it
a
try
fantastic
with
salad
d
decent
beer
for
an
adjunct
lager
good
session
beer
and
one
that
i
would
drink
again
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
rich
gold
color
with
1
inch
head
there
is
a
light
sweet
aroma
taste
is
very
flavorfull
starts
a
little
grainy
and
finishes
sweet
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
quite
delicious
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
had
this
beer
last
night
and
didnt
write
down
any
of
the
finer
points
of
the
beer
for
a
sophisticated
review
and
that
was
because
there
really
wasnt
much
to
record
and
there
were
no
real
qualities
that
jumped
out
this
is
an
adjunct
lager
with
a
slightly
drying
salty
finish
there
was
plenty
of
cooked
veggie
musty
lager
aromas
and
tastes
this
was
entirely
mediocre
beer
that
i
didnt
finish
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
but
i
really
wouldnt
want
to
an
okay
lager
its
actually
somewhat
enjoyable
and
id
certainly
except
one
in
kenya
or
actually
several
places
a
little
too
much
of
the
vegetable
flavor
in
this
one
although
its
barely
there
good
but
plenty
room
for
improvement

brews
d
just
fine
for
drinking
as

but
not
a
beer
i
have
to
return
to
by
itself
this
was
a
gamble
a
tryworthy
beer
from
a
foreign
land
as
such
it
was
decent
enough
but
not
one
worth
seeking
out
wouldnt
refuse
if
offered
but
wont
seek
out
either
another
example
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
done
better
by
nonamericans
named
after
george
hurst
a
cofounder
of
kenya
breweries
ltd
who
was
killed
by
an
elephant
during
a
hunting
expedition
in
1923
d
very
easy
light
in
body
and
decently
carbonated
refreshing
thirst
quencher
but
that
is
all
i
can
see
where
this
would
be
a
choice
in
120
degree
heat
overall
not
horrific
and
no
real
offweird
flavors
just
not
alot
going
on
either
cool
to
try
but
not
worth
seeking
it
was
a
dull
yellow
in
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
and
average
lace
malt
scent
to
it
very
dry
taste
to
it
not
bad
at
all
but
doesnt
really
do
anything
for
me
either
a
very
light
golden
color
with
a
white
one
finger
head
of
relatively
thin
foam
beer
was
fairly
carbonated
aroma
was
light
grass
and
a
hint
of
hops
if
you
strained
hard
enough
taste
was
thin
watery
and
carbonated
a
hint
of
biting
hops
id
say
slightly
better
than
a
normal
macro
d
i
hope
to
try
more
beers
from
the
african
continent
i
am
certain
there
are
better
beers
than
this
for
the
people
to
enjoy
drinkability
very
light
and
boring
beer
easy
to
quaff
but
youll
tire
of
this
one
quickly
d
i
guess
this
is
pretty
drinkable
i
could
probably
drink
a
whole
case
although
i
dont
know
why
i
would
maybe
good
for
a
hot
summer

not
a
good

no
real
shock
as
it
is
from

not
going
to
get
again
but
worth
trying
drinkability
is
on

with
any
macro
lager
slightly
more

miller
high
life
next
time
ill
look
for
a
bottled
on
date
d
if
this
is
what
africa
has
to
offer
as
a
premium
quality
lager
ill
import
my
own
if
i
visit
found
this
at
my
favorite
sofa
bar
and
loved
it
it
pours
well
with
a
good
amount
of
head
this
kenyan
lager
blows
most
american
lagers
away
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
everything
a
lager
should
be
if
you
see
this
one
in
your
local
beer
store
give
it
a
shot
as
its
made
in
kenya
i
hope
it
will
make
me
a
faster
marathoner
i
was
drawn
to
this
beer
mostly
because
i
wanted
to
try
an
africanstyle
beverage
but
my
hopes
for
this
beer
were
quickly
dashed
this
beer
is
rather
metallic
in
taste
and
has
an
overall
sloppy
feeling
on
the
palate
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
you
can
cross
off
your
list
but
probably
not
worth
going
back
for
ordered
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
restaurant
i
poured
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
no
head
to
speak
of
and
no
lacing
the
color
is
very
light
sitting
next
to
my
glass
of
water
i
could
barely
tell
the
difference
between
the
two
the
aroma
is
subdued
to
say
the
least
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
hops
and
malt
and
i
really
had
to
take
a
few
deep
sniffs
to
register
the
aroma
the
taste
is
much
the
same
very
mild
on
hops
and
grain
with
a
bit
of
a
funky
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
bubbly
overall
a
rather
underwhelming
beer
that
barely
registered
on
my
senses
i
think
the
bottle
with
the
elephant
logo
was
the
coolest
part
of
this
beer
pours
very
clear
pale
yellow
with
small
head
smell
is
not
very
strong
grassy
and
sweet
malts
pretty
normal
lager
smell
clean
taste
average
sweetness
very
crisp
and
light
pretty
pleasant
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
good
lager
im
glad
i
tryed
it
and
would
have
it
again
overall
a
very
good
lager
very
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
decent
flavor
give
it
a
whirl
it
probably
wont
rock
your
world
but
its
a
decent
lager
that
is
quite
drinkable
and
should
go
well
with
food
even
if
its
a
bit
forgetable
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
but
it
is
highly
drinkable
particularly
in
a
hotweather
climate
got
from
the
ls
pours
with
a
great
big
healthy
head
lacing
is
quite
supreme
good
start
here
has
some
corn
and
a
hop
smell
similar
to
saaz
some
sweetness
in
the
chewer
is
a
very
refreshing
lager
beer
also
has
a
low
to
medium
crispness
not
bad
stuff
i
can
see
drinking
this
in
nairobi
i
picked
is
up
at
disneys
aninal
kingdom
d
not
very
flavorful
but
goes
down
ok
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
its
a
typical
beer
for
the
style
but
not
one
that
id
want
to
drink
again
if
i
had
too
many
other
choices
d
a
decent
smooth
and
sweet
drink
that
was
easy
to
put
down
but
may
be
limited
in
quantities
due
to
its
high
sweet
character
as
a
single
moderately
enjoyable
pale
lager
i
guess
a
very
pale
clear
looking
golden
color
a
pretty
good
sized
head
that
did
fizzle
away
pretty
quickly
but
left
some
on
top
the
aroma
is
grassy
grainy
floral
and
a
little
fruity
and
not
bad
this
however
isnt
a
very
good
tasting
beer
first
of
all
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
leaving
me
wanting
a
lot
more
the
flavor
consists
of
mild
hops
but
more
grainy
and
grassy
and
an
all
around
typical
mass
marketed
below
average
lager
taste
except
it
wasnt
that
cheap
i
bought
a
single
at
a
local
store
and
compare
to
the
other
pricesquality
they
had
this
was
a
horrible
deal
i
think
i
may
at
least
get
to
cross
off
another
country
ill
pound
one
if
someone
gives
it
to
me
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
reminds
me
of
red
stripe
with
the
heavy
sweet
buttered
corn
flavor
but
not
as
good
best
by
date
of

pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
a
nice
amount
white
foam
that
slowly
recedes
leaving
behind
little
lacing
smell
is
of
some
sweet
malt
and
not
much
else
taste
is
surprisingly
refreshing
and
quite
nice
for
this
style
its
simple
yet
good
some
lightly
toasted
malt
small
amount
of
spiciness
tiny
notes
of
fruitiness
and
a
very
light
hop
character
slightly
sweet
up
front
dry
on
the
finish
crisp
and
decent
carbonation
easily
drinkable
and
a
great
session
macrostyle
lager
an
all
around
nice
beer
and
my
first
from
africa
id
take
this
over
any
bmc
aml
any
day
easy
to
drink
and
a
step
up
from
many
macro
lagers
worth
a
try
d
an
excellent
drinkable
refreshing
beer
cheers
i
surely
hope
that
not
all
african
beers
taste
like
this
one
it
was
just
a
cheap
watery
beer
with
a
small
taste
of
malted
grains
thats
all
folks
for
this
beer
if
you
find
2
on
the
street
and
you
want
to
buy
a
beer
with
it
then
you
might
want
to
buy
it
would
buy
again
not
bad
the
exotic
nature
of
this
brew
from
africa
is
tough
to
not
be
excited
over
still
responsible
scrutiny
must
be
adhered
to
predominantly
transparent
straw
yellow

with
discernable
carbonation

one
slithers
a
seltzery

cinches
it
im
not
going
to
enjoy
this
unless
i
have
a
six
of
it
in
kenya
poured
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
pleasant
bubbly
white
head
smell
was
fairly
average
and
mild
some
grainy
malts
and
a
little
grassy
hops
the
taste
had
malts
up
front
that
were
kind
of
bready
plus
hops
that
were
a
little
earthy
and
tangy
leaving
a
light
zing
at
the
end
a
tad
watery
a
dry
finish
but
the
taste
was
what
a
light
macro
lager
should
be
crisp
and
freshing
m
d
light
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
the
sensation
on
the
palate
is
a
little
thin
very
drinkable
but
theres
not
much
complexity
here
to
entice
me
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
this
beer
definitely
has
two
things
going
for
it
though
its
damn
refreshing
and
not
offensive
in
the
least
i
guess
i
was
just
hoping
for
a
little
more
flavor
and
aroma
d
for
the
style
quite
good
a
step
up
in
flavour
and
quality
than
your
average
light
lager
ive
yet
to
travel
to
kenya
but
id
imagine
that
under
a
humid
east
africa
sun
this
may
be
exactly
the
kind
of
beer
youd
hope
to
see
in
front
of
you
even
still
ive
had
tusker
finest
quality
lager
on
many
occasions
over
the
years
and
even
from
the
confines
of
my
suburban
canadian
dwellings
never
once
thought
it
a
bad
beer
in
fact
its
consistency
and
quality
are
exemplary
id
take
this
over
most
any
domestic
commercial
lager
drinkability
is
great
and
the
crsip
refreshment
is
very
nice
for
a
warm
weather
beer
this
pours
an
extreme
pale
goldso
pale
im
not
sure
ive
ever
seen
one
so
light
in
colorthe
head
looks
nice
and
bleach
whitewith
lots
of
lace
left
behind
the
nose
is
strange
to
me
like
chlorine
or
somthing
so
clean
it
almost
has
no
smell
this
tastes
like
raw
uncooked
spagetti
noodleswith
some
grassy
grainy
flavors
on
the
tail
its
light
in
body
and
semi
creamy
evenfinishing
extremly
crisp
and
clean
not
bad
at
allrefreshingeasy
drinker
taste
was
along
the
same
lines
but
underwhelming
the
hop
character
was
herbal
and
did
keep
it
from
being
completely
boring
a
decent
beer
but
why
pay
more
for
something
so
mediocre
d
while
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
macrobrewed
beer
it
still
isnt
all
that
great
not
without
its
good
qualities
though
i
remember
i
couldnt
keep
this
beer
on
the
shelf
at
total
wine
when
i
worked
there
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
myself
had
it
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
thick
gold
color
the
smell
was
of
creamy
caramel
the
taste
was
the
same
and
i
love
that
taste
in
general
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
me
because
i
cant
get
enough
of
the
caramel
taste
i
could
see
enjoying
this
deep
in
the
jungle
on
a
safari
good
times
foamy
head
not
too
bad
to
have
on
occasion
not
a
beer
that
grows
on
you
quickly
d
think
water
but
with
carbonation
d
this
is
why
i
love
this
beer
super
drinkable
and
halfway
decent
taste
d
a
one
this
beer
is
different
than
any
other
macro
lager
that
ive
had
refreshing
and
fresh
my
first
african
beer
and
a
yummy
first
at
that
d
this
basic
but
tasty
lager
went
well
with
some
big
sausages
and
turkey
dogs
nothing
special
going
on
here
but
its
a
very
respectable
if
a
bit
basic
lager
if
this
is
classified
as
an
american
macro
then
its
probably
about
the
best
aml
that
ive
ever
had
pours
a
typical
strawyellow
but
the
head
is
nice
and
thick
and
sticks
around
for
a
bit
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
rather
typical
of
a
lager
except
there
is
a
fruity
hint
flavor
is
malty
about
average
for
a
lager
but
better
than
the
typical
megabrew
lager
it
feels
a
little
thin
and
watery
but
is
still
pleasant
to
drink
d
easy
going
down
this
one
drank
a
little
better
than
a
typical
american
macro
lager
still
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
my
first
beer
from
africa
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
some
malt
character
in
the
nose
and
perhaps
some
grassy
notes
the
palate
is
light
and
dry
malt
and
breadiness
on
the
palate
balanced
by
some
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
dry
and
quick
not
too
bad
if
only
it
were
hot
and
sunny
day
if
i
had
reviewed
this
beer
in
africa
the
score
would
have
been
a
lot
higher
sadly
in
the
cold
light
of
an
english
day
it
didnt
come
up
to
muster
dvery
smooth
it
reminds
me
of
what
a
good
light
beer
could
taste
like
this
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
and
quite
clear
with
decent
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
average
as
i
cant
pick
up
many
characteristics
in
it
the
taste
is
consistent
with
a
macro
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
i
did
manage
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
pretty
easily
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
drinkability
nothing
special
here
avoid
in
favor
of
some
richer
more
robust
beers
this
is
an
exception
to
my
rule
that
brew
is
best
closer
to
home
the
only
reason
i
believe
that
tusker
has
become
so
popular
is
because
there
are
so
many
tourists
in
kenya
and
it
is
a
novelty
to
drink
an
african
beer
with
that
ohsoafrican
elephant
on
the
label
this
one
is
basically
plain
old
beer
and
is
a
very
far
cry
from
the
malt
lager
by
tusker
which
i
think
is
supremely
better
and
shows
more
attention
to
craft
all
of
this
brews
qualities
are
the
standard
mass
produced
ones
the
end
brilliantly
clear
straw
color
under
a
tall
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
some
patchy
lace
dripping
down
the
sides
doughy
sweet
pale
malt
aroma
with
clean
fruity
honey
notes
almost
pilsenerlike
in
character
clean
sweet
grainy
flavor
follows
the
nose
there
is
a
papery
taste
that
cheapens
the
experience
considerably
the
body
is
light
but
not
watery
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
extremely
easy
to
consume
and
probably
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
african
day
not
bad
for
what
it
is
im
always
a
sucker
for
these
brews
from
countries
that
have
no
brewing
tradition
what
you
get
is
generally
this
sort
of
beer
boring
american
macro
the
beer
exits
the
12ounce
bottle
a
light
gold
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
crowns
the
body
as
it
erodes
the
lace
forms
a
thin
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
sweet
malt
aroma
almost
maple
syrup
crisp
and
clean
start
has
a
fair
malt
presence
thin
at
the
top
which
was
expected
finish
has
a
pedestrian
acidity
the
hops
mild
but
present
dry
aftertaste
a
fair
to
middling
beer
a
product
of
its
environment
certainly
better
than
many
beers
from
such
countries
the
taste
is
standard
import
macro
lager
that
could
of
come
from
anywhere
a
little
malt
is
detectable
in
an
otherwise
adjunct
heavy
beer
very
watery
but
it
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
tried
it
because
it
was
unique
compared
to
what
else
was
there
however
it
was
really
not
that
special
at
all
i
am
glad
i
chose
it
over
the
bmc
making
up
the
majority
of
the
rest
of
the
choices
however
it
was
of
the
same
vain
i
suppose
you
could
do
much
worse
in
a
selection
however
this
was
really
not
that
great
i
would
have
it
again
if
it
was
ice
cold
and
i
was
thirsty
and
did
not
have
to
pay
for
it
but
either
then
that
i
will
find
one
from
somewhere
else
drinkability
another
okay
but
odd
african
lager
drinking
price
is
nice
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
a
highly
drinkable
lager
with
a
crisp
and
balanced
taste
well
done
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
had
a
small
thin
head
that
was
gone
like
right
now
the
beer
was
very
light
pale
looking
and
smelled
like
some
weird
flowers
or
something
the
taste
was
very
yeasty
to
me
and
just
not
very
good
i
will
not
be
purchasing
this
beer
again
i
tried
this
beer
on
september
13
2007
at
smokeless
joe
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
grainy
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
some
yeast
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
high
carbonation
the
taste
was
grassy
as
with
a
lot
of
macro
style
lagers
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
white
in
color
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparce
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
caramel
and
corn
bread
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
annoyingly
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
marco
lagers
i
have
had
alcohol
was
4
2
with
an
exp
date
of
feb
08
light
straw
yellow
shade
of
clear
a
frothy
white
head
on
pouring
but
it
settled
quickly
some
decent
lacing
looked
promising
gentle
carbonation
mild
grass
or
daisies
on
the
nose
very
feint
almost
unnoticeable
taste
has
a
hint
of
hops
but
then
a
bit
sweet
on
the
finish
bitterness
is
fleeting
mouthfeel
started
out
smooth
but
turned
a
bit
syrupy
very
light
body
this
beer
is
pleasant
enough
but
not
a
taste
sensation
by
a
long
shot
a
bit
boring
did
not
live
up
to
its
label
then
again
it
might
be
a
crossover
beer
for
macro
drinkers
in
north
america
who
want
to
pretend
theyre
on
safari
tasted
thin
but
had
a
slight
trace
of
hips
and
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
certainly
no
strong
taste
to
write
home
about
and
resembled
a
slightly
more
malty
macrobrew
that
you
might
get
here
this
is
kenyas
attempt
at
the
american
ie
budweiser
lager
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
large
head
the
head
disappates
quickly
but
a
lace
remains
for
the
entire
glass
the
malty
taste
was
a
little
dry
which
sticks
in
your
mouth
after
you
swallow
leaves
the
tongue
dry
and
slightly
metallic
a
dry
lager
not
undrinkable
but
could
use
some
work
this
fails
entirely
on
its
relatively
simple
premises
drinkability
it
was
okay
i
dont
know
why
but
i
expected
a
little
bit
more
from
it
d
pretty
high
a
solid
picnic
beer
or
something
for
summery
days
clean
smooth
but
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
was
very
good
i
dont
care
for
lagers
in
general
but
ordered
a
second
because
it
was
so
smooth
tusker
premium
lager
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
grainy
i
can
taste
a
fair
amount
of
malt
and
lots
of
grain
theres
not
much
more
to
it
very
light
bodied
this
is
a
decent
enough
lager
worth
a
try
an
all
around
good
lager
the
perfect
lawnmower
beer
and
its
made
in
kenya
certainly
a
decent
enough
lager
and
one
id
have
on
safari
in
africa
or
my
backyard
though
nothing
to
get
excited
over
the
beer
has
some
freshness
and
crispness
that
cary
it
a
long
way
pours
a
vivid
straw
color
with
airy
head
retention
for
about
a
minute
aromas
of
green
apples
pilsner
malts
and
earthy
hops
seem
well
balanced
the
flavors
of
apples
pears
light
malt
and
fresh
hops
spice
things
up
a
bit
but
never
interfere
with
the
fresh
yeast
hop
character
the
body
is
lighter
than
the
flavors
but
never
seem
watery
finihses
wiht
a
minty
snap
and
a
crisp
dryness
the
beer
is
put
together
well
but
lacks
the
character
to
raise
far
above
average
d
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
it
looked
better
than
it
smelled
or
tasted
there
just
was
much
in
terms
of
flavor
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
and
grainy
the
taste
is
smooth
with
no
negative
bite
there
is
hints
of
vanilla
and
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
a
chore
to
drink
one
of
the
better
macro
style
beers
i
have
had
a
much
better
choice
than
some
others
i
could
easily
session
this
beer
although
the
price
would
kindly
limit
that

into
a

tiny

malty

with
skunky
hops
throughout
relatively
active
carbonation
rising
through
the
pale

saturated
hue
of
yellow
the
first
sip
was
actually
better
than
i
had
expected
big
malty
flavor
and
a
slightly
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
aftertaste
has
a
little
tinge
to
it
but
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
way
better
than
most
americancanadian
macro

1
95
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
i
first
tried
this
beer
many
years
ago
when
a
fraternity
brother
was
sent
to
somalia
in
the
early
90s
and
he
returned
with
large
bottles
of
tusker
i
found
a
12
oz
bottle
recently
and
thought
i
would
test
it
against
my
more
complex
palate
some
10
years
later
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
middle
of
the
road
macro
lager
really
nothing
more
or
less
it
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
do
it
could
be
mistaken
for
any
of
a
hundred
other
beers
but
if
one
finds
themselves
in
the
bush
of
the
serengeti
it
would
more
than
quench
your
thirst
kenyas
version
of
bud
not
a
bad
impression
but
nothing
more
either
a
grassy
astringency
early
quickly
leaves
as
there
is
little
to
no
aftertaste
consistant
for
the
style
but
way
overpriced
a
little
hops
can
be
detected
early
underwhelming
but
probobly
a
touch
better
in
taste
and
distinction
than
most
massprolags
bought
on
a
recommendation
but
i
cannot
give
the
same
recommendation
because
this
is
overpriced
and
only
slighty
above
average
warsteiner
meets
budweiser
perhaps
the
most
overpriced
beer
of
all
time
this
lager
pours
a
nice
clear
birght
yellow
with
a
massive
head
that
lefts
its
mark
as
it
was
consumed
fruityfloral
sweet
smell
with
a
little
vienna
malt
aroma
probably
not
vienna
but
that
is
what
it
smells
like
heavier
on
the
tongue
that
most
lagers
with
a
nice
malt
character
to
it
the
hops
are
very
well
balanced
with
plenty
of
malt
to
back
it
up
a
clean
and
tangy
taste
with
a
kind
of
dry
aftertaste
a
good
example
of
the
lager
style
kenya
is
much
better
known
for
their
long
distance
runners
than
for
their
beer
and
tusker
beer
illustrates
why
maybe
they
run
a
long
way
to
get
better
beer
drinks
semiokay
more
malt
please
id
take
this
over
a
bmc
any
time
love
to
get
a
semfresh
bottle
of
this
d
you
could
probably
go
all
night
on
this
if
you
were
so
inclined
drawback
im
not
paying
2
a
12oz
bottle
for
lawnmower
brew
i
was
reintroduced
to
this
beer
at
nyala
resturaunt
in
los
angeles
the
first
time
i
drank
tusker
was
in
kenya
while
in
the
marine
corps
from
what
i
remember
this
was
a
great
tasting
thrist
quenching
beer
it
was
poured
into
a
chilled
beer
mug
the
appearance
was
a
yellowish
gold
the
nose
was
malty
and
wet
metal
the
taste
is
malt
with
slightly
sweet
notes
with
the
food
mug
and
memories
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
decent
flavor
a
little
white
in
another
pale
lager
passable
aroma
light
mouthfeel
even
a
tad
grainy
rather
than
creamy
and
little
taste
macro
type
ale
a
tad
metallic
midsip
can
drink
it
if
thirsty
fresh
more
malty
than
bitter
suitably
carbonated
passable
overall
rather
than
a
standard
macro
somewhat
watery
but
clean
and
refreshing
not
bad
ive
had
worse
but
not
exciting
either
overalli
really
hope
bill
clinton
has
better
taste
in
beer
than
this
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
batch
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
buying
it
anytime
soon
to
find
out
everyone
who
had
one
at
the
party
just
thought
it
was
gross
presentation
sample
reviewed
was
a
500
ml
short
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
the
legend
beer
only
is
molded
into
the
bottle
i
could
not
agree
more
with
this
sentiment
tusker
was
formerly
packaged
in
a
12
oz
green
glass
long
neck
bottle
this
package
is
a
significant
improvement
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
decent
head
and
heavy
carbonation
nothing
really
special
about
this
just
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
went
down
almost
too
quickly
almost
as
good
as
chechvar
but
with
the
carbonation
of
a
san
miguel
a
good
choice
for
a
session
beer
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
slightly
raspy
finish
medium
body
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
overall
kenya
beer
nah
more
of
a
keenno
beer

this
is
a
i
am
not
so
keen
on
this
beer
actually
i
always
wanted
to
give
it
a
whirl
though
well
thats
my
curiosity
well
and
truly
put
down
i
have
no
plans
to
head
out
to
kenya
thats
for
sure
give
it
a
shot
this
poured
from
the
bottle
a
very
average
yellow
with
a
slight
ring
of
head
at
the
top
of
the
glass
a
grassy
smell
makes
its
way
to
the
nose
in
this
one
not
too
bad
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
very
subtle
in
the
hops
and
malt
with
a
very
clean
finish
this
is
one
of
the
more
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
brews
ive
had
overall
not
bad
for
as
much
as
this
beer
cost
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
ive
been
disappointed
by
imports
in
the
past
but
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
for
the
style
its
not
horrible
but
if
im
going
to
drink
a
bland
macro
lager
ill
stick
with
a
u
s
product
like
rolling
rock
iron
city
straub
or
yuengling
premium
it
was
however
my
first
african
beer
most
likely
not
the
last
review
when
called
to
but
first
you
must
drink
beer
wow
what
a
lot
of
nothing
the
aroma
totally
lies
to
you
i
was
expecting
atleast
some
grassy
hops
on
the
palate
but
nothing
goes
down
like
nothing
so
drinkability
should
be
good
but
whod
want
to
drink
another
one
of
these
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
fairly
light
and
thin
starts
off
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
but
the
finish
again
has
a
slight
honey
flavor
comes
off
as
sweeter
but
more
balanced
than
most
other
massproduced
lagers
and
is
very
drinkable
if
uninteresting
imo
its
not
awful
there
are
worse
out
there
but
nothing
about
it
would
have
me
buy
it
again
this
is
a
sticky
sweet
lager
with
flavors
of
grain
covered
up
by
sugar
and
has
what
seems
to
be
a
subdued
sugary
fruit
aftertaste
something
like
a
fruit
roll
up
nothing
offensive
about
the
taste
and
its
actually
quite
addicting
considering
the
low
abv
i
would
have
expected
this
to
be
very
thin
but
the
sugar
seems
to
beef
it
up
a
bit
this
is
unexpectedly
balanced
and
i
would
place
it
somewhere
in
the
malt
liquor
category
somehow
i
could
see
this
coming
in
a
40
everything
was
going
good
until
the
taste
if
youre
looking
for
a
top
quality
macro
this
isnt
it
do
yourself
a
favour
and
get
a
red
stripe
there
was
a
respectable
head
on
the
beer
while
i
was
pouring
it
but
it
shrunk
way
down
the
nose
and
taste
has
grains
and
a
weak
grassy
hop
aroma
theres
nothing
spectacularly
exciting
about
this
lager
but
its
head
and
shoulders
above
bmc
and
things
like
heineken
the
most
impressive
thing
is
how
well
this
4
2
abv
beer
holds
up
in
transit
across
the
world
everybody
seems
to
forget
myself
included
that
drinkability
should
factor
in
whether
you
want
to
drink
or
buy
the
beer
again
sure
its
easy
to
drink
and
mighty
refreshing
but
i
dont
plan
on
spending
2
99
for
another
one
of
these
anytime
soon
d
not
too
bad
at
all
cant
say
its
flavourful
but
within
the
style
its
really
quite
good
better
than
i
was
expecting
this
is
an
uncomplex
but
refreshing
lager
fun
to
drink
as
far
as
being
sessionable
but
not
an
exceptional
beer
on
any
real
scale
guess
i
drank
a
little
more
then
i
thought
it
in
england
i
hope
it
doesnt
give
me
a
headache
after
reading
the
reviews
i
was
kinda
scared
of
this
one
but
i
persevered
poured
from
500
ml
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
color
a
clear
gold
with
tight
bubbles
taste
was
full
and
clean
and
refreshing
maybe
the
american
macro
lagers
should
be
called
african
macro
lagers
medium
yellow
with
a
bit
of
chill
haze
bright
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thick
collar
with
some
lacing
evident
malty
aroma
with
floral
and
fruity
hops
maybe
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
as
well
clean
flavour
with
lightly
fruity
malt
sweetness
and
delicate
floral
hops
bitterness
appears
towards
the
end
and
contributes
to
a
slightly
drying
finish
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
not
bad
at
all
i
kind
of
like
it
d
this
beer
was
very
light
and
didnt
have
much
character
to
it
for
the
style
it
did
have
some
faint
notes
of
kolsch
beers
and
it
would
have
been
nice
to
pull
those
out
if
i
had
to
drink
this
style
it
would
probably
be
this
beer
bright
clean
straw
to
pale
yellow
colored
beer
has
a
big
foamy
white
head
and
good
lace
kinda
a
sweet
honey
character
up
front
with
a
sweet
grassy
note
following
there
is
a
light
sweet
malty
character
at
the
start
of
the
taste
with
a
little
nibble
of
hop
bite
on
the
finish
which
carries
with
it
a
hint
of
honey
easy
drinking
and
not
bad
tasting
mouthfeel
is
smooth
light
and
refreshing
goes
down
like
water
becuase
its
about
the
same
consistency
carbonation
is
nice
and
not
overly
excited
drinkability
is
good
here
i
could
easily
session
this
brew
and
maybe
i
would
one
day
if
i
travel
to
kenya
obviously
living
in
the
us
there
are
many
other
beers
id
choose
first
but
this
suprised
me
for
an
import
lager
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
has
a
cool
looking
500
ml
bottle
with
an
elephant
on
it
not
great
but
worth
trying
this
brew
doesnt
offer
that
much
even
icecold
but
it
doesnt
include
anything
unexpected
either
glad
i
tried
it
on
to
something
else
maybe
not
great
without
the
authentic
atmosphere
if
youre
going
to
mow
your
lawn
and
you
can
buy
this
beer
for
1
like
i
did
then
you
might
as
well
chug
a
tusker
after
you
are
done
mowing
it
will
blend
right
in
with
all
the
other
aromas
and
tastes
in
your
mouth
overall
really
not
a
bad
beer
much
better
then
other
macros
such
as
budmiller
and
the
like
went
great
with
the
burger
with
the
first
bottle
very
refreshing
and
the
taste
seems
to
grow
on
you
the
more
you
drink
worth
a
taste
in
my
book
if
i
was
in
kenya
i
wouldnt
go
thirsty
by
not
drinking
it
but
not
one
i
would
try
again
500ml
bottle
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
color
lager
with
nice
foamy
with
head
with
better
retention
then
expected
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
are
very
faint
and
almost
nonexistent
taste
is
refreshing
with
some
malt
and
very
little
hops
the
surprising
thing
about
this
one
is
that
it
is
not
skunk
even
though
is
traveled
5000
miles
in
a
light
brown
bottle
the
tusker
i
tried
was
the
one
brewed
in
tanzania
beer
drinkers
say
that
it
is
better
than
the
kenyan
original
it
is
a
light
beer
with
only
4
2
alc
good
for
a
hot
day
in
dar
taste
and
aroma
are
neutral
good
for
thirst
quenching
but
not
for
pleasure
overall
i
thought
it
was
drinkable
but
barely
if
your
having
a
bbq
or
laying
around
in
the
hammock
or
something
this
is
decent
i
like
lagers
too
so
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
style
it
does
the
job
it
is
supposed
to
do
this
isnt
for
a
heavy
beer
geek
night
maybe
for
a
summer
night
at
the
grill
hockin
down
steamers
and
other
light
fare
session
beer
ahoy
drinkability
plenty
light
enough
to
drink
without
thinking
but
nothing
to
go
chasing
after
flavor
is
plain
to
slightly
better
than
plain
adjunct
but
hey
its
from
kenya
and
its
got
a
friggin
elephant
on
the
label
extra
12
point
in
the
drinkability
column
for
hippnes
bia
yangu
nehi
yangu
kenyan
for
try
it
once
if
you
like
to
try
a
large
number
of
beers
because
it
is
ok
but
nothing
unusual
or
extraordinary
i
would
drink
this
one
again
in
hot
weather
solid
macro
lager
500
ml
brown
bottle
best
before
date
clipped
into
label
same
bottle
as
picture
pours
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
1
inch
white
head
the
foam
quickly
shrank
to
a
thin
ring
aroound
the
edge
of
the
glass
didnt
leave
any
lacing
smell
was
very
mild
and
weak
the
taste
has
some
slight
grains
some
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
hopat
the
end
full
carbonation
leaves
a
tingling
bite
on
the
tongue
with
enough
dryness
to
erase
any
aftertaste
clean
finish
at
only
4
2
it
could
be
a
better
than
average
light
beer
i
thought
a
bit
overpriced
but
i
guess
it
is
an
import
500
ml
bottle
this
beer
is
almost
completely
clear
there
is
just
a
shade
of
yellow
the
head
is
big
white
and
fizzy
the
aroma
is
a
grainy
its
the
smell
you
often
get
walking
into
a
brewery
the
flavor
is
bland
but
inoffensive
just
a
bit
of
maltiness
but
otherwise
this
is
seltzer
water
no
bitterness
maybe
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
pretty
refreshing
so
it
gets
a
high
drinkability
rating
as
a
light
beer
this
is
pretty
solid
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
a
solid
beer
if
not
overly
impressive
would
probably
pick
it
over
many
of
the
standard
macro
lagers
besides
how
often
do
you
find
kenyan
beer
my
first
and
only
african
beer
i
have
tried
went
in
with
low
expectations
and
well
it
was
pretty
average
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
decent
head
but
it
is
gone
in
a
flashlight
iron
aromas
with
some
toasted
grain
but
not
much
to
it
but
it
didnt
offend
me
so
ok
taste
is
light
just
to
watered
down
there
is
some
graininess
but
just
not
enough
going
on
i
could
see
this
beer
being
chugged
in
the
kenya
heat
maybe
even
the
nc
heat
but
no
other
timeill
pass
again
this
lager
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
but
clung
a
bit
and
left
a
little
lacing
there
was
a
steady
bubbling
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
minimal
but
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
to
room
temperature
a
very
light
biscuity
malt
aroma
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
biscuit
with
a
light
floral
hop
flavor
and
very
very
light
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
smooth
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
feel
it
was
relatively
clean
with
a
trace
of
sweetness
this
was
a
decent
lager
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
crystal
clear
lager
pale
gold
with
a
bigbubbled
foamy
head
that
didnt
last
a
minute
buttered
corn
smell
overpowers
any
grassiness
honestly
this
tasted
about
like
most
macros
a
solid
adjunct
lager
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
lighter
than
i
expected
as
if
water
had
somehow
separated
from
the
beer
and
remained
on
the
tongue
unless
it
is
skunked
or
warm
most
adjuncts
are
relatively
easy
drinkers
ill
get
some
of
these
and
have
folks
over
to
watch
hatari
and
the
snows
of
kilimanjaro
i
heard
someone
say
that
hemingway
liked
this
stuff
so
its
only
fitting
bia
y
angu
nchi
yangu
my
beer
my
country
the
body
is
very
very
light
neal
was
right
this
is
a
good
lawnmower
beer
it
is
superior
to
the
mainstream
american
lagers
and
good
for
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
coming
from
kenya
i
see
why
this
beer
is
the
way
it
is
when
poured
into
a
glass
the
only
way
ive
ever
enjoyed
a
tusker
most
beer
is
better
this
way
tusker
offers
an
abundant
head
that
leaves
a
noticeable
lacing
mouthfeel
is
excellent
with
a
subtle
carbonation
that
almost
tickles
the
tongue
rather
than
overpower
the
beer
nice
and
refreshing
a
beer
i
enjoy
in
a
style
i
generally
dont
enjoy
ill
defintely
buy
more
of
this
on
a
pairing
note
pairs
well
with
mild
buttery
foods
like
juicy
roast
chicken
or
buttery
potatoes
drinkability
this
one
did
the
trick
it
both
quenched
my
thirst
and
tasted
good
at
the
same
time
recommended
it
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
foamy
collar
that
leaves
lots
of
lace
trails
behind
the
aroma
is
very
weak
with
some
limpid
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
of
wet
cardboard
grain
husks
and
stale
white
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
and
theres
virtually
no
hop
bitterness
carbonation
is
less
fizzy
than
other
adjunct
lagers
this
is
an
average
lager
its
definitely
more
flavorful
that
labatt
blue
or
bud
but
not
as
flavorful
as
becks
or
grolsch
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
laced
well
smell
had
a
lot
of
cooked
vegetable
smell
and
a
bit
of
hops
taste
wasnt
too
bad
not
overly
carbonated
like
many
adjunct
lagers
quite
a
good
amount
of
hops
and
good
clean
finish
light
mouthfeel
and
was
quite
drinkable
for
an
adjunct
lager
but
certainly
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
perhaps
if
i
am
ever
in
kenya
and
this
is
on
tap
id
appreciate
it
more
i
still
wouldnt
pick
tusker
premium
lager
unless
nothing
else
good
was
available
but
for
a
macro
lager
its
tough
to
beat
a
pleasant
surprise
from
kenya
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
cream
white
ivory
head
that
resembles
the
elephant
tusks
on
the
bottle
the
smell
is
of
honeygrain
and
subtle
dough
a
nice
lemon
zest
refreshes
the
nose
the
tate
is
clean
and
refreshing
a
nice
citrus
upfront
leads
to
the
honey
smooth
taste
better
than
i
expected
good
beer
for
watching
the
ball
games
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
and
a
decent
white
head
lace
is
minimal
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
kind
of
grassy
or
strawlike
the
taste
is
much
the
same
kind
of
grassy
with
a
small
afterbite
that
you
can
taste
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
more
average
than
anything
bought
2
500ml
bottles
the
other
day
and
drank
them
on
two
distinct
evenings
i
was
actually
able
to
detect
the
subtle
flavors
better
in
the
second
bottle
the
beer
pours
very
very
pale
yellow
almost
clear
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
decent
head
moderate
density
though
it
has
the
same
color
as
many
macros
none
of
the
metallic
macro
smell
in
fact
there
is
little
smell
at
all
outside
mild
honey
subtle
herb
flavor
plus
a
decent
undertone
of
honey
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
the
deserts
of
kenya
country
of
origin
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
refreshing
drink
but
you
have
to
search
to
find
its
distinctive
qualities
enjoyable
if
not
exceptional
this
kenyan
is
crisp
and
refreshing
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
nice
thirst
quencher
worth
a
try
nevertheless
it
is
an
easytodrink
beer
but
since
it
lacks
personality
and
body
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
i
realize
that
90
of
national
beers
are
going
to
be
pale
lagers
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
amongst
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
that
national
pale
lager
category
not
that
this
is
something
id
rush
out
to
find
but
the
kenyans
should
be
proud
of
a
betterthanaverage
national
beer
drinkable
extremely
well
suited
to
eating
wild
game
dishes
like
antelope
good
african
lager
one
thing
about
africa
they
have
a
love
affair
with
lagers
this
beer
poured
a
faint
standard
yellow
sort
of
what
most
north
americans
would
think
of
when
they
think
of
beer
head
was
a
short
12
finger
height
but
boy
was
it
strong
that
foam
lasted
til
it
was
suds
at
the
bottom
of
the
mug
sparce
strips
of
lace
were
left
in
purely
random
places
on
the
glass
very
odd
apparent
almost
soda
cracker
smell
dominated
the
nostrils
it
was
pleasantly
refreshing
a
bit
of
a
sweetstarchy
smell
overall
same
soda
crackerlike
taste
sort
of
a
dry
starchy
taste
never
experienced
that
in
a
beer
before
but
hey
i
like
it
and
my
judgement
will
show
it
their
is
a
hop
presence
when
swallowing
refreshing
dry
and
crisp
mouthfeel
very
refreshing
lager
appearance
pale
golden
straw
color
to
it
not
bad
with
a
visible
frothy
white
head
does
leave
behind
semi
decent
specks
of
lacing
not
bad
aroma
lemongrass
light
and
airy
a
touch
of
herbal
hop
note
very
mild
smell
to
it
but
nice
and
simple
taste
a
nice
blend
of
semi
sweet
graininess
with
very
clean
tasting
lager
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
there
mouthfeel
a
light
bodied
lager
with
a
fizzy
note
to
the
overall
texture
drinkability
very
refreshing
the
type
of
beer
i
would
consume
if
residing
in
kenya
theres
is
nothing
offensive
its
just
a
clean
tasting
lager
with
a
nice
citrus
grassy
note
to
the
overall
flavor
well
this
is
a
definite
step
up
from
bmc
which
was
my
worry
before
i
tried
this
beer
this
beer
is
a
bit
fuller
has
a
bit
more
flavor
to
it
there
are
some
definite
soft
complementing
spicy
hop
notes
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
a
nice
subtle
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
crisp
clean
beer
with
a
bit
of
maltgrain
sweetness
to
it
having
said
all
this
it
is
still
not
a
great
beer
worth
trying
perhaps
because
it
is
from
kenya
but
just
barely
the
beer
pours
an
almost
clear
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
weak
and
almost
nonexistant
what
little
there
was
smelled
of
pale
malts
and
little
else
the
taste
is
less
than
average
it
is
quite
watery
and
bitter
it
has
little
malt
flavor
but
does
go
down
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
i
feel
like
one
of
those
dudes
in
the
miller
lite
commercials
i
cant
taste
my
beer
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
decent
carbonation
this
beer
sucks
its
one
and
done
for
me
light
and
thin
bodied
it
comes
across
kind
of
like
unskunked
heineken
i
imagine
it
would
be
rather
drinkable
in
an
incredibly
hot
and
humid
area
nothing
special
just
about
budmiller
range
but
how
often
would
i
have
a
beer
from
kenya
worth
buying
once
just
for
that
fact
theres
just
something
off
about
this
beer
i
cant
say
id
ever
have
it
again
or
recommend
it
far
too
expensive
at
the
lcbo
for
this2
85
canadian
per
bottle
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
actively
seek
out
by
any
means
its
cheap
and
adjuncty
and
i
could
pick
dozens
of
american
macros
if
i
wanted
that
in
a
beer
overall
just
plain
and
unexciting
cracked
the
bottle
open
and
instant
skunk
aroma
came
out
luckily
and
strangely
it
disappeared
for
the
most
part
shortly
thereafter
this
one
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
colour
witha
nice
white
frothy
head
that
dissolves
rather
quickly
to
a
lasting
lace
with
surprising
stickiness
the
smell
did
retain
a
bit
of
the
skunkiness
but
aside
from
that
there
wasnt
much
else
in
the
smell
department
save
for
maybe
some
grain
and
hop
smells
the
taste
is
again
grain
and
hop
though
mostly
watered
down
yet
crisp
and
refreshing
without
being
overly
carbonated
theres
a
bit
of
a
sweet
aftertaste
that
did
not
compliment
the
dry
finish
so
much
a
slightly
below

this

is
pretty

what
i
expected

buttery

not
impressive
it
pours
a
clear
strawgold
body
topped
by
a
full
and
creamy
brightwhite
head
that
holds
fairly
well
before
dropping
and
leaves
some
nice

the
bouquet
expresses
a
grainy
malt
sweetness
with
some
mild
grassy
and
floral
hoppiness
in
the
background
the
body
is
thin
but
exceptionally
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
fine
carbonation
the
palate
is
limited
to
a
gently
sweet
maltiness

obviously
thinned
by
a
liberal
use
of
adjunct
and
balanced
by
an
understated
bitterness
some
minor
floral

flavor
is
present
if
you
seek
it
out

doesnt
present
itself
otherwise
it
finishes
short
and
sweet
just
vanishing
from
the
palate
in
much
the
same
way
it
came
in
its
a
teasing
beer
that
continually
leaves
you
looking
for
more
which
adds
to
its
drinkability

not

its

job
of
cutting
the
humidity
of
the
summer
and
quenching
my
thirst
i
did
note
with
some
curiosity
that
the
bottle
had
a
best
before
notch
date
which
was
9
months
later
than
my
purchase
i
doubt
this
beer
made
it
from
kenya
to
kentucky
in
a
big
hurry
which
makes
me
wonder
if
the
brewer
promotes
a
oneyear
shelflife
ive
always
assumed
a
sixmonth
shelf
life
was
pretty
standard
for
nonbottle
conditioned
beer
and
i
cant
imagine
a
oneyear
shelf
life
for
a
light
lager
like
this
one
great
for
the
beach
even
better
when
its
free
at
an
all
inclusive
resort
pretty
watery
minimal
taste
but
refreshing
if
cold
and
served
on
a
beach
cheap
adjunct
lager
not
my
thing
not
great
not
awful
ok
for
an
island
beer
what
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
should
be
one
of
my
favorite
industrial
lagers
great
with
caribbean
food
i
compare
beers
against
their
own
style
so
this
scores
high
for
me
firmly
mediocre
and
uncrafty
but
drinkable
fairly
light
but
more
interesting
than
many
tropical
beers
better
than
light
if
you
dont
want
rum
for
a
night
go
with
these
its
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
in
hot
weather
not
a
winter
beer
i
love
presidente
id
choose
it
over
dos
equis
corona
and
just
about
any
other
mass
produced
mexican
or
dominican
beer
i
had
it
first
at
port
on
the
island
of
saint
maarten
during
a
cruise
vacation
so
i
thought
maybe
my
intoxication
affected
my
perceptions
so
i
tried
it
again
when
i
got
home
still
great
very
refreshing
crisp
clean
and
easy
to
drink
perfect
for
hot
days
and
bbqs
if
youre
looking
to
grab
something
cheap
and
in
mass
best
when
served
near
freezing
right
out
of
bottle
this
beer
is
shit
if
no
better
option
then
this
will
suffice
but
if
you
have
a
choice
pick
anything
else
go
corona
dr
has
corona
hell
go
coors
light
it
was
the
only
beer
we
had
to
drink
in
the
d
r
last
year
it
remained
mediocre
under
all
circumstances
even
in
the
caribbean
sun
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
sides
aromas
of
sweet
bready
pilsner
malt
with
an
hint
of
sulfur
and
some
faint
floral
essence
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
hint
of
spice
light
body
with
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
and
just
shy
of
watery
in
the
mouth
ive
had
much
worse
but
i
could
see
a
few
of
these
going
down
easily
on
a
beach
somewhere
dont
see
why
it
has
bad
reviews
pairs
very
good
with
food
and
its
very
crisp
generic
south
american
lager
no
more
or
less
pleasant
than
corona
but
certainly
not
very
good
much
more
on
the
dry
side
than
many
this
one
builds
up
to
a
sort
of
chalky
finish
that
said
its
crispness
is
consistently
strong
and
its
not
horribly
unclean
it
avoids
stickiness
which
is
something
overall
eh
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
again
unless
i
found
myself
in
the
dr
and
wanted
a
local
quaff
on
the
beach
othis
was
a
okay
was
smooth
and
refreshing
it
o
im
not
a
fan
of
pilseners
nor
lagersadjunct
lagers
but
i
have
to
say
that
im
honestly
impressed
by
this
i
hold
dominican
cuisine
near
and
dear
to
my
heart
so
when
i
saw
a
dominican
brewed
beer
in
the
cooler
i
had
to
pick
it
up
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
while
its
very
much
along
the
lines
of
a
bmc
offering
presidente
offers
more
flavor
a
lot
more
character
in
the
mouth
and
serves
as
a
refreshing
beverage
alongside
some
summer
food
will
definitely
be
keeping
this
in
mind
for
my
next
family
bbq
switzerland
italy
mayjune
2013
o
this
is
a
beer
thats
very
much
like
other
tropical
lagers
ive
had
its
not
my
favorite
but
its
not
repulsive
either
its
just
kind
of
there
ive
rated
it
relatively
highly
because
it
is
in
my
opinion
and
experience
exactly
what
i
expected
from
a
lager
exported
from
a
tropical
country
it
gets
lots
of
points
for
being
true
to
the
style
but
loses
points
subjectively
because
as
true
to
style
as
it
is
its
not
a
style
that
im
in
love
with
by
any
means
beats
the
hell
out
of
corona
though
well
balanced
and
refreshing
a
good
example
of
the
adjunct
style
the
hops
are
non
aromatic
but
provide
the
expected
refreshing
bitterness
that
lets
you
quench
your
thirst
pleasant
yeasty
nose
combined
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
a
very
clean
finish
make
this
an
excellent
choice
for
warm
weather
chillin
at
12
for
a
12
pack
its
really
worth
checking
out
if
we
ever
get
through
the
winter
great
beer
to
have
on
a
sunny
beach
but
not
so
great
if
you
want
a
lot
of
taste
out
of
it
overall
nice
and
refreshing
can
see
how
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
beach
not
bad
for
an
adjunct
the
beer
has
little
character
and
cannot
be
recommended
but
it
may
the
lesser
of
evils
if
you
find
yourself
in
this
part
of
the
world
it
was
better
than
the
local
aruba
beer
the
presentation
and
bottling
were
first
rate
cheers
aruba
cheers
dominican
republic
overall
meh
go
with
port
royal
after
a
holiday
in
the
dominican
i
went
on
a
mad
5
year
search
for
this
beer
when
served
as
the
natives
do
at
home
with
a
pinch
of
sugar
in
a
stout
glass
this
beer
has
become
my
absolute
favorite
strong
head
no
after
taste
no
heavy
beer
drag
but
with
a
nice
5
pop
it
is
no
wonder
that
thou
the
dominican
is
one
of
the
poorest
countries
in
the
world
the
people
all
seem
to
have
a
smile
on
their
face
i
always
have
one
when
drinking
presidente
overall
pretty
straightforward
and
normal
pilsner
it
could
be
more
crisp
and
refreshing
but
just
middle
of
the
road
perfectly
average
also
forgettable
but
by
no
means
terrible
good
beach
beer
this
beer
is
just
bleh
i
actually
shuddered
after
a
few
drinks
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
if
im
ever
in
the
dominican
republic
ill
stick
to
wine
stay
away
unless
its
your
only
choice
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentytwo
ounce
green
glass
bomber
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
i
had
this
ontap
in
bottles
and
cans
all
while
in
the
dominican
republic
it
tastes
pretty
close
to
bud
light
or
miller
light
which
is
to
say
not
bad
for
a
day
at
the
beachpool
but
not
something
you
drink
for
its
flavor
its
light
on
the
alcohol
so
you
can
definitely
enjoy
a
good
amount
of
em
and
it
doesnt
really
do
you
in
i
enjoyed
it
because
i
was
out
in
the
sun
and
it
didnt
dehydrate
me
quite
as
much
as
heavier
stuff
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
with
a
beer
like
this
this
beer
is
alright
to
try
once
if
you
are
in
the
dominican
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
good
beer
a
below
average
macro
tasting
pilsner
with
good
looks
nothing
spectacular
here
yellowish
color
light
head
that
dissipates
quickly
overly
carbonated
which
im
learning
i
just
dont
like
it
has
the
taste
of
a
lite
beer
and
no
i
had
the
regular
type
not
lite
i
even
had
two
this
evening
just
to
make
sure
of
my
impression
i
sure
do
like
trying
beers
from
other
countries
but
the
dominican
republic
wont
be
one
country
ill
be
looking
at
any
time
soon
o
overall
my
two
cents
would
be
that
this
beer
is
one
of
the
better
american
adjunct
lagers
oxymoron
it
was
a
bit
more
than
the
fizzy
carbonated
water
i
expected
finally
getting
down
to
reviewing
presidente
a
beer
that
many
caribbean
travelers
finally
had
the
chance
to
purchase
in
these
parts
a
few
months
ago
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
puffed
rice
and
a
touch
of
mild
skunk
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
in
true
adjunct
beer
fashion
though
there
is
now
a
bit
more
corn
and
a
bit
less
skunk
thank
god
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
sad
boring
beer
i
assume
those
who
have
fond
memories
of
this
beer
were
really
just
remembering
the
good
times
they
had
on
cruises
and
whatnot
corn
saltine
crackers
adjunct
laden
thankfully
clean
and
not
too
weird
fairly
crisp
and
not
sweet
at
all
dry
and
bland
vague
noble
hop
character
seltzer
water
mouthfeel
however
simple
it
manages
to
be
pretty
quenching
not
something
id
grab
again
but
it
gets
the
job
done
while
passing
the
time
overall
its
always
taking
a
chance
to
try
a
beer
from
a
new
country
not
much
of
a
risk
here
though
presidente
thy
name
is
coors
light
my
beer
of
choice
when
vacationing
in
the
caribbean
without
a
doubt
o
when
i
was
in
the
dominican
republic
my
beer
choices
were
this
or
miller
high
life
so
i
went
with
this
nothing
to
write
home
about
by
any
means
o
not
recommended
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
it
doesnt
really
offer
much
in
the
terms
of
taste
most
of
the
bars
in
the
places
i
was
in
left
you
with
a
choice
between
heineken
corona
bud
light
and
presidente
in
this
class
presidente
was
and
still
is
president
overall
a
fine
adjunct
lager
o
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
beer
that
matched
very
well
with
the
spicy
latin
american
food
that
i
had
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
beers
and
they
were
quite
refreshing
on
a
warm
late
spring
evening
gets
pretty
bad
ratings
here
but
compared
to
other
aals
ive
had
i
was
more
bullish
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
faint
yellowish
coloring
that
is
very
translucent
a
chunky
frothy
white
head
sits
atop
the
surface
and
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
are
toasted
grain
and
a
hint
of
roasted
corn
with
a
tangy
floral
highlight
throughout
flavors
are
very
watered
down
with
a
sharpness
to
them
that
makes
this
a
tough
drink
toasted
grains
and
a
tangy
musty
breadlike
character
make
up
most
of
the
palate
part
of
this
reaches
a
point
where
you
dont
want
to
know
what
else
it
is
you
are
tasting
bleh
the
aftertaste
is
astringent
and
corn
sweet
almost
becoming
syrupy
rough
finish
leaving
the
mouth
battered
and
limp
not
good
thin
head
and
no
lacing
on
a
clear
straw
yellow
body
aroma
is
mostly
pale
malt
and
sweet
corn
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
sweet
corn
little
malt
and
no
bitterness
light
body
and
high
carbonation
i
stand
by
my
belief
that
most
of
these
adjunct
lagers
are
just
regular
budweiser
in
a
different
bottle
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
voluminous
white
head
heavily
carbed
evident
in
the
body
and
the
ridiculous
head
generation
spotty
lacing
but
rocky
and
almost
whipped
creamlike
retention
pretty
good
looking
for
an
aal
a
bit
of
corn
in
the
nose
cooked
veggies
grainy
malts
and
a
bit
of
metal
taste
has
some
sweet
and
vegetal
notes
malty
a
bit
of
cereal
and
again
a
bit
metallic
plain
and
mildly
sweet
in
the
finish
blegh
overall
not
the
advertised
pilsner
but
probably
something
conducive
for
getting
blasted
with
on
a
beach
in
the
caribbean
presidente
doesnt
get
my
vote
not
for
best
beer
nor
for
worst
in
fact
i
am
utterly
disinterested
in
it
this
unless
one
is
in
the
mood
for
something
fast
and
mindless
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
worst
things
that
can
be
said
about
any
beer
mind
you
however
i
am
not
most
drinkers
and
more
likely
than
not
others
will
find
that
a
very
positive
attribute
this
wasnt
an
awful
beer
it
was
fine
with
dinner
it
didnt
offer
much
in
terms
of
flavor
or
character
its
unoffensive
but
ultimately
it
can
be
ignored
i
figured
a
cruise
was
the
perfect
time
to
try
beers
id
not
had
before
so
since
this
boat
had
a
dr
flag
flying
off
the
back
of
it
i
felt
i
should
rep
the
pseudoterrain
that
i
was
living
in
it
appears
as
a
golden
color
that
you
would
expect
from
the
style
the
aroma
had
that
cooked
corn
smell
typical
of
lower
quality
ingredients
the
flavor
had
some
flaked
corn
and
cheaper
barley
taste
but
it
wasnt
all
that
bad
for
a
drink
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
nice
and
a
lot
more
hearty
that
i
would
have
assumed
overall
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
but
i
didnt
order
it
again
on
the
boat
i
went
back
to
the
hard
stuff
o
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
to
rave
about
its
basic
beer
od
easy
not
bad
for
the
style
enough
flavour
to
be
drinkable
inoffensive
but
not
interesting
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
and
have
it
only
depending
on
the
situation
i
come
from
a
dominican
family
i
really
try
my
best
to
respect
this
beer
but
in
my
honest
opinion
this
is
nothing
more
than
your
basic
lager
maybe
a
little
more
dry
granted
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
your
at
the
beach
in
dr
believe
me
the
review
for
this
beer
is
definitely
much
higher
but
unfortunately
i
am
not
on
that
beach
every
day
hope
you
all
enjoy
but
be
warned
salud
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
clean
beer
light
flavored
and
generic
for
sure
but
gulpable
not
to
gassy
and
a
touch
stronger
then
some
of
the
other
locals
although
the
label
clearly
states
5
abv
not
the
6
listed
at
the
time
of
this
review
although
ive
submitted
the
change
o
a
decent
cheap
brew
pretty
much
what
i
expected
one
and
done
for
me
a
nice
gesture
but
like
i
said
never
have
a
stranger
buy
you
a
beer
o
this
lager
is
a
good
cheap
option
since
its
very
drinkable
and
decent
consumed
straight
from
the
bottle
at
villa
pizza
in
manhattan
nyc
paired
with
some
supreme
pizza
basic
pilsner
taste
with
kind
of
a
skunk
background
not
light
struck
just
heineken
style
i
figured
a
czech
pilsner
would
go
well
with
the
pizza
the
thin
and
high
carbonation
washed
down
the
pepperoni
and
sausage
pretty
well
sure
its
not
super
delicious
but
it
washed
my
food
down
nicely
the
best
and
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
from
the
dominican
republic
if
im
not
mistaken
cheezy

skunked

grain
and
a
very
mild

there

very
refreshing

not
a
beer
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy

not
one
i
would
not
buy

it

and
good
enough
flavor
d
this
beer
is
above
my
expectations
i
realize
thats
not
the
highest
praise
but
this
is
a
good
emulation
of
simple
traditional
german
lagers
like
some
of
the
smoother
viennas
etc
this
is
widely
available
in
new
york
supermarkets
and
i
will
have
to
rate
it
higher
than
some
of
its
mexican
competitors
cough
corona
cough
cough
d
nothing
special
for
its
style
but
as
far
as
a
common
american
lagerpilsner
draft
this
was
solid
not
too
filling
for
the
alcohol
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
on
draft
since
its
more
common
in
south
florida
poured
a
clear
straw
color
uhoh
i
see
where
this
is
going
carbonation
and
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
fizzled
out
to
nothing
mostly
grains
and
staleness
in
the
aroma
weak
taste
of
grains
corn
metallic
hops
bitter
and
very
unflavorful
very
light
and
not
very
drinkable
at
all
unless
bland
and
unimaginative
and
adjunct
is
your
thing
what
can
you
say
about
this
one
it
was
widely
available
in
the
caribbean
and
for
the
most
part
cheaper
than
water
which
is
the
flavor
i
get
most
from
it
pretty
much
the
bmc
of
the
caribbean
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
but
it
was
ok
to
drink
when
it
was
free
on
a
hot
boat
ride
glad
i
brought
my
own
beer
this
isnt
a
sharp
tangy
pilsner
almost
mellow
in
its
mouthfeel
ok
but
not
a
lagerpilsner
id
stock
a
regular
basis
overall
its
a
classic
dook
lager
typical
drunk
ass
slammable
lager
brew
no
worse
than
the
american
eqiuvalents
but
probably
significantly
cheaper
and
produced
in
better
conditions
than
the
third
world
ghettos
of
st
louis
poured
on
tap
at
mia
thin
white
head
some
lacing
color
is
clear
strawgold
aroma
is
sweet
and
corny
flavor
is
a
typical
blend
of
sweet
malt
corn
adjunct
and
noble
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
overall
a
good
caribbean
refresher
enjoyed
on
special
at
sergios
in
miami
fl
this
beer
poured
into
a
chilled
mug
which
means
way
too
much
head
was
produced
and
took
a
while
to
be
able
to
drink
the
beer
is
a
clear
pale
golden
color
the
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
with
some
grassy
hop
notes
but
not
very
strong
or
well
balanced
the
taste
is
crisp
and
grassy
with
a
little
skunky
note
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
overcarbonated
but
finishes
very
clean
with
no
lingering
harsh
flavors
goes
well
with
a
salad
but
overall
nothing
i
would
ever
choose
to
get
again
since
there
was
nothing
else
left
to
try
on
the
menu
i
picked
up
one
of
these
its
a
drinkable
lager
but
its
just
nothing
special
if
youve
had
one
adjunct
lager
then
youve
probably
had
this
one
too
the
beer
is
yellow
without
much
of
any
head
the
smell
is
bitter
and
the
flavor
is
grassy
and
bitter
not
much
else
to
really
say
about
it
o
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
are
on
a
resort
sitting
on
the
beach
with
a
novel
trying
to
avoid
getting
too
sunburned
certainly
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
in
the
states
given
the
probable
mark
up
ive
never
seen
it
in
the
states
but
for
my
money
much
better
than
corona
pacifico
etc
then
again
i
dont
ever
buy
those
here
either
overall
i
say
a
good
beer
for
the
style
d
very
drinkable
but
a
premiem
price
ill
have
to
pass
lay
over
miami
international
might
as
well
try
a
beer
from
the
dominican
i
will
go
against
the
grain
and
comment
that
this
beer
is
better
than
a
lot
of
mexicanbraziliancolombian
beers
that
i
have
tried
its
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
decent
yellow
in
color
no
smell
white
head
some
lacing
could
seriously
put
these
down
with
no
problem
which
means
tastedrinkabilitymouthfeel
are
all
solid
cmon
man
try
it
dont
buy
in
states
but
when
on
vacation
its
a
nice
afternoon
beer
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
his
brew
was
the
look
for
the
quality
of
the
beer
and
the
price
there
was
a
surprisingly
robust
head
atop
the
beer
while
the
coloring
was
mute
and
the
tastes
bland
this
was
one
nice
thing
about
a
beer
that
fits
comfortably
around
the
same
level
as
its
competitors
this
would
be
the
type
of
beer
you
would
expect
to
cost
a
buck
at
the
ballgame
my
aggro
pour
resulted
in
just
over
a
fingers
worth
of
foamybonewhite
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
it
was
the
one
aspect
of
the
style
that
i
truly
cansistently
enjoy
it
looked
like
liquid
sunshine
in
the
glass
brightening
otherwise
dull
winter
days
i
know
stones
stance
fizzy
yellow
beer
is
for
wussies
and
so
i
am
not
worthy
of
some
all
of
their
flagship
beers
but
so
be
it
this
looked
like
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
beer
the
nose
was
still
heavy
on
saaz
but
not
skunky
so
it
must
have
been
a
pentup
whiff
that
escaped
when
i
prised
it
open
opening
a
green
bottle
forrest
gumps
box
ochocolates
russian
roulette
you
just
never
know
what
you
are
going
to
get
the
head
had
fallen
leaving
a
little
bit
of
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
it
still
tasted
more
of
saaz
hops
than
of
adjuncts
in
the
mouth
it
was
more
like
a
watery
czech
pils
than
an
aal
finish
was
slightly
husky
towards
but
not
heavy
on
silage
frankly
it
was
not
too
bad
for
the
style
and
i
wonder
if
it
might
be
any
better
from
a
can
m
refreshing
for
sure
plenty
of
carbonation
with
a
heavy
body
d
it
must
be
drank
ice
cold
anything
less
and
the
beer
will
be
insulting
to
pallate
a
friend
brought
this
over
tonight
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
i
could
definitley
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
has
a
nice
crispness
to
it
i
really
like
this
beer
compared
to
bud
this
is
an
a
in
the
american
adjunt
lager
category
enjoyed
a
presidente
right
out
of
the
freezer
stright
from
teh
bottle
once
i
opened
the
bottle
the
beer
started
to
crystalize
to
frozen
leaving
me
a
very
very
cool
beer
great
stuff
i
have
had
this
beer
before
on
the
golf
course
great
summer
beer
everything
about
this
beer
is
wrong
but
the
fact
that
its
somewhat
drinkable
when
ice
cold
on
a
beach
or
in
a
dive
bar
in
the
latitudes
pale
yellow
has
a
head
smell
not
good
corn
and
earth
taste
corn
and
syrup
and
earth
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
like
i
said
drinkable
but
atmosphere
has
to
right
and
taste
buds
need
to
be
asleep
d
ive
been
killing
these
nonstop
since
i
got
to
the
dominican
republic
surprised
it
comes
in
at
6
was
expecting
it
to
be
around
4
overall
if
you
looking
for
a
beer
order
a
millerbud
light
or
some
other
brand
of
beer
before
spending
the
extra
cash
for
this
import
final
thoughts
well
i
did
get
bombed
on
it
once
during
my
stay
in
the
dominican
but
as
the
week
dragged
on
i
found
myself
turning
to
rum
so
it
certainly
did
overstay
its
welcome
although
given
it
was
the
only
beer
i
could
get
without
having
to
pay
an
arm
and
a
leg
i
cant
say
i
minded
however
lets
just
say
im
not
surprised
this
stuff
isnt
widely
imported
as
far
as
caribbean
beer
is
concerned
id
prefer
red
stripe
i
had
this
beer
while
on
a
vacation
to
the
dominican
republic
i
had
this
beer
during
my
week
stay
at
a
resort
in
la
romana
dr
because
it
was
the
only
beer
option
offered
at
the
resort
this
was
unfortunate
because
this
beer
falls
somewhere
between
a
budweiser
and
a
corona
which
is
not
a
good
thing
the
beer
seemed
very
watered
down
and
had
little
flavor
it
was
a
very
light
beer
so
you
could
drink
a
lot
in
one
sitting
if
you
could
ignore
the
fact
that
there
is
not
much
good
about
this
beer
as
far
as
taste
goes
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
rjt
it
tastes
a
lot
like
miller
genuine
draft
with
a
tad
more
maltyness
and
some
skunkyness
after
a
little
research
the
brewery
also
produces
miller
genuine
draft
coincidence
nah
it
is
nothing
special
and
is
just
a
mediocre
bland
americanstyle
pilsnerlager
smelled
a
little
hoppy
with
an
overpowering
skunk
aroma
the
taste
was
pretty
skunky
as
well
but
there
was
a
little
hop
taste
and
enough
flavor
to
identify
it
as
a
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
first
couple
of
beers
it
is
really
sort
of
like
water
after
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
by
the
pool
it
starts
to
taste
pretty
bad
but
if
youre
just
having
2
or
3
and
are
providing
for
people
that
arent
really
beer
drinkers
its
a
good
choice
overall
it
was
not
that
the
flavor
was
that
terrible
but
there
was
just
something
about
this
that
i
just
could
not
do
its
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
unfortunately
its
the
preferred
beer
for
some
people
in
my
crowd
and
its
hard
to
steer
them
away
for
being
an
american
adjunct
lager
its
pretty
good
although
its
marketed
as
a
pilsner
that
being
said
i
like
it
for
a
drink
but
i
wont
be
going
out
and
getting
this
for
myself
i
had
a
very
tough
time
drinking
more
than
2
of
these
in
a
row
i
have
had
quite
a
few
latin
american
light
lagers
and
this
actually
was
on
of
my
least
favorites
dr
very
drinkable
but
unremarkable
d
light
crisp
and
tastier
than
the
average
american
macro

simple

not
spectacular
but
still
palatable
texture
is
fairly
smooth

tingly
overall
an

advertises
theres
a

detectable
perhaps
very
crisp
as
a
pilsner
must
be
although
i
see
this
categorized
as
a
plain

its

very
easy
drinking
of
course
not
offensive
at
all
in
my
book
crisp

refreshing

sure
most
anybody
would
be
okay
with
this

not

beer
from
my
limited

definitely
more
in

with
macro
pilsners
from
europe
its
okay
not

to
report
if
its
all
they
have
at

consider
yourself
better
off

d
although
i
would
not
usually
buy
it
under
the
right
circumstances
i
will
chug
the
hell
out
of
it
because
it
works
well
with
mexican
food
or
anything
spicy
and
its
nice
in
the
sun
too
for
2
dollars
on
a
hot
caribbean
day
id
say
this
is
a
winner
drinkability
this
is
not
a
very
impressive
beer
there
are
way
better
beers
from
the
carribean
region
its
a
nice
golden
color
producing
a
bunch
of
foamy
white
head
it
smells
a
bit
of
wheat
with
a
trace
of
corn
it
goes
down
easily
enough
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
this
was
the
only
beer
available
at
the
allinclusive
resort
i
stayed
at
i
grew
fond
of
it
not
out
of
necessity
but
because
its
enjoyable
id
take
this
over
any
american
macro
pilsner
this
is
a
pretty
weak
hack
at
a
pilsner
plenty
of
overcooked
grain
and
that
classic
coronalike
skunk
nothing
doing
in
terms
of
hops
this
might
be
appropriate
to
quaff
on
the
beach
with
a
few
lime
wedges
but
makes
for
a
disappointing
brew
overall
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
yeast
very
slight
hops
and
strong
adjunct
fits
the
style
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
pale
malt
slight
hops
and
strong
finish
of
adjunct
overall
right
on
par
with
other
adjuncts
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
this
again
there
is
too
much
to
be
desired
drink
is
good
all
and
all
i
like
this
beer
i
really
didnt
know
anything
about
it
and
i
seen
the
handle
and
gave
it
a
shot
i
would
much
rather
have
this
than
a
corona
as
there
is
some
taste
to
this
now
to
drinkability
it
is
slightly
higher
in
alcohol
than
most
bmc
products
so
the
fact
that
you
would
subject
yourself
to
less
uh
quality
challenged
beer
is
a
big
plus
the
fact
that
the
beer
is
still
mediocre
pretty
much
negates
that
however
living
in
a
subtropical
climate
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
it
has
a
cooling
quenching
quality
d
the
drinkability
is
alright
aside
from
the
metallic
finish
and
lack
of
significant
flavor
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
deceiving
d
maybe
bc
it
was
the
only
beer
available
while
suffering
through
the
90
degree
100
humidity
days
but
average
at
best
but
not
horrific
several
years
back
on
a
vacation
to
a
dominican
resort
they
had
this
on
tap
for
free
they
had
some
beers
you
could
purchase
but
i
drank
free
all
week
and
i
would
not
have
done
that
if
i
thought
this
beer
was
crap
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
mild
hop
balance
at
6
the
alcohol
is
detectable
as
there
is
not
much
to
hide
behind
with
presidente
you
at
least
know
you
are
drinking
a
beer
instead
of
flavored
water
falls
somewhere
between
a
adjunct
lager
and
malt
liquor
not
too
shabby
i
could
drink
this
again
drinkability
does
it
get
the
job
done
when
youre
at
the
beach
and
the
pool
as
far
as
quenching
thirst
sure
does
id
never
buy
it
otherwise
though
and
yes
clearly
its
not
a
great
brew
at
6
though
youll
feel
good
after
a
day
in
the
sun
after
two
or
three
of
them
overall
unimpressive
lager
that
is
easily
drinkable
in
the
hot
humid
dr
weather
sitting
in
a
pool
all
week
this
was
easy
to
drink
but
i
wont
intentially
look
for
this
notes
i
read
the
info
that
this
beer
does
not
travel
well
the
green
bottle
does
not
help
this
beer
was
a
single
from
a
case
in
miami
it
traveled
in
the
carry
on
of
a
good
friend
and
while
subjected
to
air
travel
it
faired
quite
well
much
thanks
to
the
kind
hearted
gal
this
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
the
abv
was
right
on
the
money
nonot
a
complex
beernot
exciting
yet
it
quenched
my
thirst
on
this
hot
night
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
rich
gold
color
with
a
1
inch
head
has
a
decent
aroma
mildly
malty
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
goes
down
smooth
with
a
mild
aftertaste
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
aroma
is
light
but
noticeable
corn
and
a
touch
of
hops
light
and
mobile
on
the
palate
malt
and
sweet
corn
dominate
the
flavor
the
finish
lacks
bitterness
but
the
light
flavors
make
this
beer
drinkable
not
bad
considering
the
style
the
taste
is
about
what
youd
expect
from
the
smell
very
reminicent
of
the
aforementioned
dutch
beers
pretty
crisp
in
the
front
somewhat
astringent
this
fades
into
well
a
skunky
taste
with
some
grains
faintly
appearing
in
the
finish
aftertaste
is
of
some
corn
adjuncts
on
the
tongue
a
little
sweetness
showing
up
surprisingly
a
bit
thicker
than
id
expect
for
this
beer
as
it
does
coat
the
tongue
after
swallowed
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
i
were
to
want
a
beer
of
this
style
id
look
somewhere
else
presidente
is
a
sparkling
crystal
clear
pale
straw
colored
cerveza
with
a
thin
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
lacing
it
smells
like
someone
ran
over
a
skunk
its
very
light
bodied
and
watery
with
a
scratchy
finish
it
tastes
like
funk
corn
and
funk
and
skunk
i
guess
someone
had
this
tiny
green
bottle
under
a
grow
light
for
a
while
d
i
can
throw
these
back
like
no
tomorrow
i
am
definitely
going
to
buy
presidente
again
corona
by
day
presidente
by
night
perhaps
drinkability
refreshing
and
worth
a
drink
when
poured
into
a
bells
pint
glass
presidente
was
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
an
ant
sized
head
of
foam
on
top
this
head
of
foam
quickly
fizzled
down
into
a
few
rings
along
the
sides
not
much
of
aroma
but
at
least
it
wasnt
offensive
or
foul
the
aroma
was
about
the
malted
cereal
grains
with
a
spatter
of
green
olives
and
apple
juice
it
sounds
worse
than
what
it
actually
was
the
taste
was
all
about
the
cheap
malted
cereal
grains
no
hops
or
apple
juice
just
malted
grains
i
could
actually
taste
the
grains
get
maltier
as
the
taste
went
on
that
was
until
the
end
of
the
taste
when
they
just
faded
away
into
oblivion
as
you
tell
already
this
was
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
to
it
the
aftertaste
was
just
a
quick
flash
of
malted
grains
despite
my
low
score
this
wasnt
a
totally
bad
beer
i
know
for
a
fact
that
i
would
choose
this
over
a
quite
a
few
domestic
adjunct
lagers
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
enough
not
too
filling
decent
kick
for
the
style
and
a
good
representation
of
style
ive
certainly
had
much
worse
but
this
still
isnt
a
beer
that
i
would
want
to
drink
again
if
i
had
other
choices
certainly
not
a
great
beer
by
any
standard
but
drinkable
i
went
to
a
friends
house
of
poker
night
and
broke
out
the
good
stuff
poured
a
lighter
yellow
color
with
a
smaller
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
corn
and
some
graininess
tastes
of
corn
sweet
maltiness
and
grainy
yep
it
is
a
pale
lager
alright
d
its
easy
to
slug
a
bunch
of
these
at
once
but
if
youre
looking
for
flavor
go
elsewhere
still
better
than
youre
standard
adjunct
though

not
a
good
beer
this
green
bottle
traveled
all
the
way
from
the
dominican
republic
to
new
york
city
where
i
bought
it
it
was
a
perfectly
clear
pale
gold
color
with
a
three
finger
head
of
creamcolored
foam
the
aroma
was
dry
and
grainy
typical
macro
stuff
with
a
slight
skunkiness
the
flavors
were
actually
decent
stale
malt
and
some
weak
citrus
hops
with
a
general
grainy
quality
the
mouthfeel
was
rough
because
the
carbonation
was
so
high
and
the
body
light
generally
generic
but
not
quite
offensive
drinkability
in
dominican
the
best
beer
to
put
back
and
drink
lots
of
on
the
beach
very
pale
golden
color
thin
white
head
pale
malt
aroma
a
trace
of
grassiness
quite
clean
tasting
not
much
of
the
skunkiness
i
expected
flavor
is
quite
thin
and
nondescript
but
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
some
light
grassy
hop
flavor
pretty
quaffable
and
much
better
than
i
would
have
thought
i
drank
at
least
a
case
of
this
while
in
st
thomas
would
buy
here
in
michigan
for
kicks
and
grinns
this
needs
something
mild
carbonation
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
sour
after
taste
not
even
very
drinkable
had
as
the
finish
on
some
mexican
food
nothing
really
but
a
flavor
washer
not
going
there
again
a
good
sub
par
beer
that
tastes
better
when
your
on
vacation
i
can
drink
this
with
some
good
cuban
food
and
it
doesnt
seem
so
bad
in
fact
it
goes
great
with
the
half
roasted
chicken
black
beans
and
rice
i
just
ordered
from
puerto
sagua
here
on
south
beach
not
really
impressed
with
this
one
pours
a
yellowish
wheat
color
with
a
very
thin
head
smell
is
nothing
special
i
saw
that
most
people
said
it
smelled
of
corn
and
malt
and
that
is
dead
on
taste
is
smooth
but
not
good
tastes
like
watery
beer
which
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
smooth
yet
no
taste
as
i
said
before
this
beer
is
nothing
to
fight
over
somewhat
watery
spend
your
money
somewhere
else
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
white
lace
head
it
has
an
ok
mild
hop
aroma
to
it
there
is
the
scent
of
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
weak
and
watery
but
not
that
bad
it
lacks
any
malt
character
and
actually
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
a
budweiser
in
taste
tad
more
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
and
could
be
quite
drinkable
goes
down
relatively
easily
but
doesnt
have
much
character
to
it
it
is
what
it
is
golden
colored
with
a
thin
head
its
pretty
smooth
but
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
flavor
and
seemed
watery
im
actually
very
surprised
at
the
6
abv
doesnt
taste
like
it
very
light
somewhat
refreshing
and
knock
this
one
up
a
grade
during
the
summer
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
for
the
style
one
of
the
better
options
at
some
locales
in
the
bvi
good
mouthfeel
and
an
equally
good
level
of
drinkability
make
for
a
light
easily
drinkable
brew
bottle
pale
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
and
short
lived
white
cap
the
nose
is
grassy
with
lots
of
pale
malts
and
a
heavy
dose
of
vegetables
tastes
of
mild
bitter
grassy
hops
with
veggies
and
straw
quick
and
spritzy
finish
not
offensive
just
not
good
last
beer
of
the
night
at
the
milky
way
in
jp
given
to
me
by
a
friend
whos
gonna
pass
up
a
free
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
looked
like
an
average
lager
smell
was
a
bit
musty
taste
was
pretty
bleak
mostly
corn
and
water
i
couldnt
believe
how
sticky
this
beer
was
in
my
mouth
bordering
on
sugary
i
have
tried
lots
of
macro
lagers
from
counties
south
of
the
border
but
this
one
is
bottom
of
the
barrel
barely
drinkable
d
for
a
pilsner
was
a
tad
rough
around
the
edges
and
didnt
make
me
look
forward
to
the
next
sip
did
not
find
it
particularly
refreshing
or
crisp
per
style
not
bad
id
drink
this
on
a
beach
off
a
beach
well
thats
another
story
the
aroma
is
light
and
grainy
no
dms
at
least
the
flavor
is
pretty
mild
with
a
lager
character
and
subtle
grain
taste
it
finishes
with
a
balancing
bitterness
and
crisp
dry
mouthfeel
not
bad
pretty
drinkable
and
completely
inoffensive
was
recently
in
the
dominican
republic
on
vacation
our
resort
had
this
beer
on
tap
only
this
beer
on
tap
only
this
beer
in
bottles
needless
to
say
for
one
week
i
became
a
lover
of
vodka
this
was
not
a
good
beer
tasted
watered
down
was
always
served
slightly
chilled
and
a
flavor
relative
to
any
us
mass
produced
beer
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
the
people
and
their
island
except
that
if
this
is
their
national
beer
a
revolution
might
not
be
a
bad
thing
drinkability
a
well
known
beer
in
dominicana
republic
but
a
bad
copy
of
pilsener
style
d
had
several
of
these
and
they
went
down
easy
so
id
have
to
say
this
is
drinkable
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
alcohol
weighs
in
at
6
more
than
some
other
macros
this
has
the
same
abv
as
dfh
60
min
ipa
and
i
cant
drink
60
min
nearly
as
quick
as
i
did
this
so
this
is
a
pretty
dangerous
macro
to
toss
back
pitchers
of
when
taking
all
of
this
into
account
and
having
lived
amongst
these
people
this
beer
is
daggone
good
nothing
tastes
better
than
an
icecold
presidente
on
a
hot
steamy
dominican
afternoon
or
night
yes
its
still
hot
and
steamy
at
night
d
goes
down
like
water
d
dont
drink
this
beer
ever
please
i
beg
of
you
it
was
downright
awful
perhaps
in
the
dominican
republic
where
its
fresh
its
mildly
better
but
man
this
was
one
horrible
beer
the
second
time
i
had
this
was
several
months
later
i
found
12packs
for
sale
at
a
large
store
in
boston
allston
across
from
the
sunset
bar
grill
upon
trying
a
bottle
it
was
evident
that
this
beer
must
be
served
very
young
and
fresh
and
does
not
travel
well
unfortunately
they
only
come
in
green
bottles
and
the
result
is
as
bad
as
any
skunky
import
presidente
is
popular
in
south
florida
and
the
caribbean
they
are
decent
to
help
wash
down
a
meal
with
but
there
are
better
brews
in
that

well
it
mentions
corn
grits
on
the
label
so
you
have
to
know
what
to
expect
its
thin
watery
and
proud
of
its
adjunct
i
dont
really
like
it
here
and
i
dont
think
id
like
it
any
better
at
home
in
the
dr
im
not
sure
a
slice
of
fruit
in
the
neck
of
a
bottle
would
save
it
either
i
finished
the
bottle
please
dont
ask
more
of
me
than
that
prosit
if
only
it
smelled
a
little
better
maybe
i
would
have
been
a
little
nicer
in
the
rating

spotty
lacing
aroma
of
straw
and
weak
malt
lightbodied
and
bubbly
with
notes
of
hay
corn
and
mild
hops
the
finish
is
relatively
flavorless
aside
from
some
weak
hops
easy
to
drink
is
about
the
best
thing
i
can
say
for
it
this
beer
is
more
or
less
an
overglorified
busch
light
though
it
has
a
bit
more
alcohol
it
usually
tastes
pretty
skunked
the
light
color
doesnt
really
help
it
much
as
it
leaves
me
wondering
why
it
was
only
2
a
bottle
at
the
bar
then
i
found
out
first
of
all
it
was
warm
so
i
gave
it
another
shot
cold
a
few
days
ago
same
result
not
very
much
taste
of
anything
except
a
little
skunky
flavor
very
watery
and
a
hint
of
light
malt
taste
with
a
very
light
hint
of
some
mild
hops
fairly
drinkable
as
it
does
not
have
much
taste
of
anything
except
the
skunky
flavor
which
knocks
some
points
off
overpriced
and
not
really
worth
it
at
all
presidente
is
a
great
southoftheborder
beer
i
know
most
people
on
this
site
would
say
that
it
takes
too
much
like
a
macro
but
it
doesnt
i
am
not
judging
this
beer
against
belgians
and
other
great
beers
it
is
a
pilsner
and
for
a
pilsner
it
is
very
good
it
ours
golden
and
crisp
and
has
a
fruity
tint
to
the
taste
very
good
pilsner
beer
perfect
for
sitting
on
the
beach
basic
yellow
golden
color
with
a
small
foam
cap
a
clean
lager
smell
as
long
as
its
draft
every
bottle
i
have
tried
has
had
a
bit
of
skunk
ahhhh
green
bottles
the
taste
is
again
basic
clean
macro
flavor
good
body
light
and
crisp
just
what
you
want
on
a
hot
tropical
day
nothing
spectacular
but
does
the
job
fairly
mild
beer
would
pair
well
with
a
mild
cigar
like
a
macanudo
i
would
never
drink
it
hear
out
of
fear
that
it
will
ruin
my
island
memories
but
somehow
there
it
has
a
quality
to
make
you
forget
anything
else
that
i
could
get
in
the
states
fine
beer
in
context
drinkability
i
would
not
got
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
but
it
is
a
good
vacation
beach
type
beer
like
most
of
the
ones
in
the
caribbean
dnot
the
best
beer
in
the
world
they
could
stand
to
use
brown
bottles
the
imperial
i
had
with
this
is
clearly
the
winner
and
will
be
my
choice
if
it
is
presented
to
me
if
you
go
the
the
dr
while
there
have
the
bohemia
and
stick
mainly
to
rum
drinks
and
have
good
beer
when
you
return
mouth
feels
dry
after
while
having
this
beer
not
the
most
refreshing
one
worth
a
try
but
not
to
drink
it
often
d
smooth
and
easy
going
down
great
on
a
hot
day
probably
just
a
tad
better
than
bmcs
ive
got
great
vacation
memories
associated
with
this
beer
therefore
im
afraid
to
try
it
out
of
the
bottle
stateside
interesting
that
this
one
falls
in
as
an
american
macro
lager
although
not
really
surprising
given
the
flavor
tastes

an
ever
so
slightly
stronger
version
of

decent
enough
but
had
a
poor
aftertaste
it
really
lingers
in

and
not
in
the
good
way
overall
the
taj
mahal
reminded
me
of
a
tasty
version
of
budweiser
i
e
it
has
more
flavor
the
beer
was
light
tasting
but
also
had
a
bit
of
hops
and
malt
it
wasnt
anything
spectacular
but
not
anything
awful
either
this
indian
lager
is
a
very
good
american
styled
lager
beer
i
bought
it
from
a
whole
foods
store
in
marietta
ga
and
it
traveled
well
from
the
brewery
no
hint
of
skunkiness
a
good
crisp
taste
a
nonoverpowering
aroma
and
a
pretty
full
body
for
a
lager
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
i
would
compare
it
with
the
other
well
known
indian
brew

like

it

ok
maybe
i
am
being
too
generous
because
i
did
just
have
a
worse
beer
and
because
it
was
free
but
im
going
to
bet
that
this
got
some
worse
grades
than
it
deserves
because
it
is
an
american
adjunct
lager
when
judging
i
believe
we
should
consider
the
style
that
said
i
never
plan
to
buy
one
unless
eating
indian
cuisine
otherwise
as
officer
barbrady
would
say
move
along
nothing
to
see
here
d
drinkability
was
fairly
decent
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
at
4
5
abv
was
a
light
refreshing
lager
making
for
a
good
picnic
beer
that
both
craft
and
micro
drinkers
should
both
be
able
to
enjoy
with
little
complaint
a
nice
clean
crisp
quality
that
showcases
the
good
brewing
technique
should
hit
the
spot
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
for
a
light
affair
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
respect
the
style
and
just
want
to
put
back
a
few
and
not
get
filled
up
i
think
i
will
pass
next
time
do
they
get
any
points
for
a
cool
label
drinkability
ugh
this
beer
is
barely
drinkable
it
might
be
better
with
food
but
i
doubt
it
stay
away
does
its
job
of
washing
down
curry
d
very
easy
if
not
boring
im
afraid
i
have
little
to
say
about
this
other
than
its
an
americanstyle
adjunct
lager
that
didnt
make
me
retch
and
washed
down
a
chicken
jalfrezi
quite
easily
while
not
something
i
would
ever
choose
to
have
again
on
its
own
merits
some
kind
of
brainpalate
association
made
this
beer
go
down
well
enough
with
some
very
decent
lamb
vindaloo
which
i
suppose
is
the
point
of
the
geographical
foodbeverage
connection
real
or
imagined
pass
mouthfeel
is
okay
quite
chewy
actually
not
as
thin
as
some
and
has
a
nice
fuzzy
foamy
texture
from
the
light
bubbling
drinkable
has
that
sourness
and
the
yeast
aftertaste
that
lowers
its
clean
asian
lager
character
but
is
a
touch
more
interesting
than
others
ive
had
d
a
pretty
uninspired
lager
that
said
it
accompanied
my
fish
curry
well
enough
not
many
uses
for
this
beer
other
than
that
there
are
better
macro
lagers
available
and
likely
at
a
cheaper
price
d
drinkable
only
to
cut
through
the
more
flavorful
indian
curries
otherwise
quite
runofthemill
for
a
lager
and
definitely
not
catered
to
the
connoisseur
a
bit
of
sweet
corniness
that
gave
way
to
a
watery
finish
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
the
mouthfeel
though
the
use
of
adjuncts
in
the
beer
is
apparent
from
the
first
sip
when
my
german
professor
asked
about
the

this

is

goes

a
bit
beefier
overall
then
the
other
usual
offering
of
kingfisher
i
must
have
had
a
very
fresh
bottle
compared
to
some
of
the
other
reviews
here
the
hop
level
was
quite
pronounced
outside
of
having
it
in
a
restaurant
i
doubt
i
would
buy
this
but
i
find
it
quite
good
overall
a
poor
choice
for
an
imported
lager
the
fact
that
mine
was
15
months
old
probably
didnt
help
but
this
one
offers
nothing
that
cannot
be
found
elsewhere
and
cheaper
avoid
d
not
very
tasty
and
its
not
the
easiest
beer
going
down
the
label
also
reads
slow
brewed
for
the
connoisseur
in
4
different
places
but
since
this
just
seems
like
fizzyyellowbeer
from
india
to
me
and
the
bomber
cost
only
0

im
not
really
sure
what
type
of
connoisseur
they
brewed
this
for
maybe
a
bud
drinker
that
wants
to
be
able
to
say
he
tried
a
beer
from
india
emporer
shah
jahan
would
be
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
bearing
the
name
of
his
famous
tribute
nothing
like
this
one
to
put
down
the
fire
on
a
good
indian
curry
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
high
carbonation
head
but
loses
the
head
quickly
the
smell
is
quite
grainy
with
some
earthy
hop
qualities
the
taste
is
fairly
average
refreshing
and
rather
balanced
with
some
sweet
maltiness
and
moderate
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
helps
balance
out
heat
from
the
food
quite
drinkable
with
a
good
dal
curry
or
samosas
its
just
not
what
i
expected
probably
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
just
wanna
pound
one
at
the
bar
while
watching
a
game
i
would
recommend
someone
drinking
one
just
to
say
they
had
consumed
a
beer
from
india
but
that
is
about
it
this
has
to
be
the
clearest
beer
ive
ever
had
i
poured
it
from
the
bottle
and
it
looked
like
water
with
a
drop
or
two
of
yellow
food
coloring
a
good
white
head
that
disspatted
quickly
and
little
lacing
aroma
was
nothing
i
could
pick
out
that
being
said
this
was
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
i
liked
it
much
better
than
the
bmc
macros
and
could
actually
see
drinking
several
if
available
at
a
party
it
did
have
a
strange
dry
aftertaste
but
all
and
all
not
bad
and
i
have
now
sampled
indian
beer
ive
never
seen
the
taj
mahal
but
ill
wager
its
way
more
impressive
than
this
likenamed
beer
its
an
indian
macro
with
all
that
status
entails
maybe
it
would
be
a
quickdraining
match
for
a
macho
curry
but
on
its
own
in
spite
of
some
fair
drinkability
i
say
why
bother
fairly
drinkable
just
not
by
any
means
an
epic
beer
i
would
have
expected
more
of
a
dry
and
distinct
hop
taste
from
this
india
lager
but
oh
well
there
are
more
beers
in
this
category
to
enjoy
dont
bother
with
this
one
its
overpriced
for
what
it
is
and
not
its
not
a
tasty
brew
served
in
a
650ml
bottle
at
my
local
indian
restaurant
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
this
is
an
ok
loooking
beer
bright
sunshine
yellow
with
a
fair
sized
frothy
white
head
not
much
aroma
at
all
some
hops
i
didnt
get
in
skunk
at
least
nice
enough
flavor
for
a
lager
sort
of
hoppy
in
the
end
malt
was
quite
sweet
and
rather
unusual
but
for
me
ok
crisp
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
dry
finish
overall
this
was
just
average
but
way
better
than
bmc
i
enjoyed
this
with
lamb
madrasi
a
medium
hot
dish
the
taj
mahal
which
means
literally
the
best
of
buildings
is
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
taj
mahal
the
indian
pale
lager
is
a
wonder
in
the
sense
that
its
the
best
beer
from
that
nation
that
ive
ever
had
and
has
exceeded
my
expectations
by
a
country
mile
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
to
drink
solo
but
i
wont
hesitate
to
order
a
bottle
or
two
if
i
happen
to
see
it
in
an
indian
restaurant
indian
beers
are
rather
on
the
sweetish
side
this
brew
is
no
exception
however
pairs
a
clean
as
opposed
to
sticky
sweetness
with
quite
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
would
think
this
being
the
best
indian
beer
i
have
tasted
so
far
on
a
rather
a
low
level
this
beer
poured
almost
completely
translucent
and
waterlike
a
very
pale
yellow
color
many
many
bubbles
there
was
a
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
but
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
taste
was
less
than
stellar
it
had
sort
of
a
smokey
smell
and
taste
some
bitterness
and
this
really
strange
sweetish
aftertaste
high
carbonation
while
drinking
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
it
really
just
had
no
flavor
i
guess
its
ok
if
youre
out
eating
indian
and
they
dont
serve
any
other
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
one
that
i
will
just
buy
a
bottle
of
again
probably
hurt
a
bit
by
its
age
but
couldnt
see
this
being
much
better
fresh
go
fo
the
mango
lassi
taste
is
bready
too
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
but
no
hops
flavor
all
around
very
light
in
the
flavor
department
mouthfeel
is
watery
especially
after
the
first
few
sips
carbonation
is
just
right
for
the
style
the
breadiness
and
the
wateriness
detract
from
drinkability
add
a
full
point
if
youre
chowing
hard
on
a
monster
vindaloo
or
for
non
spiceheads
korma
otherwise
ignore
and
ridicule
taj
mahal
premium
lager
pours
a

orange
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
is
slow
to
dissipate
from
a
brown
22
ounce
bottle
smells
okay
kind
of
fruity
maybe
a
slight
bit
spicy
taste
is
a
bit
fruity
and
malt
definitely
kicks
in
too
not
very
balanced
flavor
fairly
inoffensive
if
not
particularly
good
your
money
is
probably
better
spent
elsewhere
on
the
label
this
beer
is
said
to
be
fit
for
kings
or
pharoahs
or
soemthing
like
that
not
true
save
some
money
and
buy
yourself
a
bud
light
think
about
it
this
beer
hails
from
a
region
of
the
planet
where
the
only
crop
to
be
farmed
is
rice
and
the
prime
ingredient
of
budweiser
beers
is
what
rice
its
thin
grainy
waterypissyellow
and
just
not
worth
it
flavorless
and
boring
subtle
carbonation
feverishly
waning
head
and
a
completley
poor
foundation
of
brewing
technique
find
this
beer
in
my
book
as
an
afterthought
of
disgust
try
again
fellas
another
of
13
beers
from
this
months
michiana
coalition
of
the
drinking
meeting
ive
seen
this
for
5
75
at
all
the
indian
resteraunts
we
go
to
but
ive
never
ordered
it
because
i
like
to
save
room
for
food
after
having
tried
it
i
believe
i
will
continue
to
not
order
it
clear
lager
some
bubbles
malty
odor
kind
of
skunky
but
in
the
way
than
macro
lagers
usually
are
malty
flavor
no
finish
really
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
this
is
actually
pretty
drinkable
despite
itself
eeeek
the
bottle
says
its
for
the
true
connisuer
aparently
india
does
not
set
their
standards
very
high
when
it
comes
to
beer
appreciation
though
the
beer
does
not
smell
or
taste
or
look
or
feel
bad
its
certainly
far
from
good
totally
emensed
with
cereal
grain
particularly
rice
and
or
corn
a
little
too
sweet
to
the
point
that
it
detracts
from
the
cleanliness
and
crispness
the
subtleties
that
make
great
lagers
great
are
either
missing
or
covered
up
by
adjuncts
it
would
be
a
fine
beer
if
it
were
free
had
this
with
some
tendoori
chicken
at
an
indian
place
in
fairfax
and
i
must
say
it
was
a
good
pairing
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
sustaining
sticky
lace
mostly
a
grain
and
caramel
aroma
in
the
moderate
nose
the
beers
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
caramel
grain
and
spearminty
hops
but
while
its
drinkable
and
it
paired
well
with
my
meal
theres
noting
really
substaintial
about
it
still
its
worth
a
try
recommended
especially
if
youre
having
it
with
indian
cuisine
drinkability
this
beer
has
an
odd
flavor
and
with
the
right
food
i
think
it
could
be
quite
good
on
its
own
though
its
not
particularly
enjoyable
pours
light
golden
wheat
very
translucent
huge
foamy
head
looks
like
a
pilsner
smell
is
a
bit
corny
hoppy
with
some
alcohol
skunk
taste
was
not
gross
bitter
nor
metallic
like
i
was
expecting
it
didnt
have
much
of
anything
in
there
though
very
light
airy
and
mildly
flavored
went
well
with
my
meal
easy
drinker
this
brew
pours
a
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
with
a
large
white
fluffy
head
the
head
lingers
for
a
long
while
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
and
corny
the
taste
is
corny
and
slightly
bitter
but
not
bitter
in
a
good
way
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
overall
this
beer
isnt
my
thing
light
golden
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
not
much
in
the
way
of
smells
some
roasted
tones
along
with
a
bit
of
fruit
very
faint
i
taste
some
indian
spices
but
they
are
just
too
subtle
to
be
enjoyable
i
also
taste
the
crisp
backbone
of
a
brew
of
this
style
rather
smooth
and
refreshing
but
not
memorable
from
a
taste
perspective
mild
and
quite
bland
pairs
well
with
indian
food
because
it
doesnt
overpower
any
dish
but
needs
a
stronger
bite
perhaps
more
hops
and
a
bit
more
intense
spices
a
beer
worth
having
now
and
again
but
not
a
favorite
this
seems
a
bit
thin
and
almost
under
carbonated
but
on
the
whole
is
tasty
and
is
great
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
notes
the
bottle
states
slow
brewed
for
the
connoisseur
does
this
mean
anything
is
this
the
indian
way
of
flattering
the
consumer
into
buying
this
product
at
least
theres
a
nice
picture
of
the
eponymous
building
on
the
label
from
the
bottle
in
a
india
rest
poured
a
hazy
golden
with
a
white
head
aroma
malts
some
hops
fruity
and
citrus
flavor
now
this
will
sound
strange
as
i
was
sitting
there
waiting
for
my
food
trying
to
figure
what
that
taste
was
my
wife
took
a
sip
and
said
olive
oil
and
that
was
it
the
couple
that
was
with
us
agreed
and
that
is
about
all
i
got
maybe
hints
of
malt
awful
just
plain
awful
it
looks
pretty
average
for
macro
swill
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
so
bad
it
detracts
from
what
little
it
has
going
for
it
in
the
appearance
department
it
has
a
terrible
sweet
corny
aroma
and
some
other
garbage
like
smell
maybe
its
the
water
the
taste
is
sweet
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
and
then
a
horrible
bitterness
takes
over
and
kills
the
rest
of
the
experience
i
expected
better
and
was
blown
away
at
how
bad
this
beer
is
buddha
would
be
ashamed
i
bought
this
beer
solely
because
i
had
never
before
tried
an
indian
beer
in
the
end
it
turned
out
the
that
the
best
thing
about
the
beer
was
the
bottle
a
big
shapely
pint
and
6
bottle
the
beer
is
a
golden
yellow
and
is
constantly
bubbling
it
had
a
respectable
head
much
better
than
a
budweisers
but
not
impressive
when
compared
to
the
average
import
the
first
taste
was
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
had
expected
from
a
lager
but
the
only
thing
remarkable
about
the
subsequent
flavor
wsa
just
how
bland
the
beer
was
this
beer
isnt
that
good
but
it
isnt
that
bad
youll
forget
what
it
tastes
like
5
minutes
after
you
finish
it
try
it
if
you
find
it
but
dont
bother
to
make
an
effort
searching
for
it
went
here
last
night
with
my
fiance
for
valentines
day
and
automatically
ordered
a
taj
mahal
with
dinner
whenever
ive
gone
to
an
indian
restaurant
ive
always
ordered
this
beer
and
have
always
liked
it
would
i
like
it
outside
of
the
restaurant
nope
wouldnt
even
give
it
a
second
look
somehow
paired
with
this
food
its
almost
magical
and
tastes
much
better
than
the
schlitz
that
it
most
resembles
surprised
by
this
beer
my
few
samplings
of
indian
beer
have
been
much
worse
but
this
one
was
not
bad
served
extremely
cold
but
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
and
the
malts
came
out
a
little
bit
more
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
in
color
with
heavy
carbonation
the
head
was
shockingly
thick
with
very
dense
bubbles
the
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
mild
hop
tone
the
taste
was
not
particularly
complex
basic
lager
malts
and
hops
but
it
was
a
tad
sweeter
than
expected
not
really
much
of
a
bite
got
this
beer
at
an
indian
resturaunt
it
came
in
a
22
oz
bottle
when
poured
into
glass
a
small
head
formed
and
dissipated
very
quickly
it
had
the
standard
adjunct
lager
golden
yellow
apperance
i
could
only
really
pick
up
a
malty
smell
from
it
the
taste
was
what
you
would
expect
from
a
cheap
american
lager
with
maltier
notes
for
the
price
i
paid
i
just
would
have
assumed
getting
a
couple
of
cheaper
american
beers
drinkability
next
later
added
i
was
doin
some
shrooms
okay
and
i
preluded
the
onset
with
this
beer
i
am
a
big
lover
or
the
indian
food
this
shit
tastes
just
like
naan
bread
if
it
were
a
liquid
if
you
can
grasp
my
meaning
there
i
like
it
and
it
is
fricking
weird
but
i
have
to
give
it
a
higher
ranking
for
what
it
is
a
strange
ass
brew
if
u
want
naan
bread
in
a
bottle
then
heres
your
ticket
mate
d
i
dont
mean
to
intentionally
slam
haze
or
rant
about
this
stuff
but
its
truly
awful
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
avert
your
eyes
and
hastily
run
away
it
may
take
on
other
more
demonic
forms
i
had
this
with
a
nice
hot
rogan
josh
that
i
made
and
kicked
the
spice
up
a
couple
of
notches
this
beer
cut
through
the
spice
well
and
i
can
see
why
it
would
do
well
in
india
not
a
beer
i
would
sip
and
savor
but
it
goes
well
with
a
fine
curry
pours
from
the
650
ml
bottle
a
light
golden
with
a
one
centimeter
thick
white
head
a
bit
of
sticky
lace
remains
on
the
glass
not
a
great
smelling
beer
the
aroma
is
not
particularly
strongin
fact
its
almost
not
there
but
what
there
is
is
not
good
fairly
mild
unpleasant
taste
some
malt
flavors
with
a
bit
of
hops
present
in
the
slightly
bitter
finish
im
not
sure
how
im
going
to
get
through
all
22
oz
of
this
stuffhopefully
one
of
my
roommates
will
come
home
and
finish
it
leaves
a
weird
feeling
on
the
tongue
a
bit
oily
perhaps
not
a
smooth
beer
medium
to
thin
bodied
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
and
certainly
will
not
have
it
again
serving
a
500ml
bottle
this
pleasant
lager
is
best
enjoyed
nicely
chilled
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
mixture
of
hops
and
malt
as
is
the
refreshing
taste
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
there
is
a
nice
head
formation
this
is
an
enjoyable
import
from
india
well
i
had
another
country
so
thats
good
but
thats
all
here
just
not
a
good
beer
even
for
a
light
lager
and
this
certainly
isnt
one
im
going
to
have
in
the
future
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
boasts
of
mainly
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
it
has
a
slight
grainy
scent
the
taste
is
horrible
it
is
extremely
light
and
watery
with
an
intense
musty
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
decent
carbonation
this
was
a
real
disappointment
this
is
a
less
than
average
lager
drinkability

yes
ill
actually
finish
this
bomber
off
myself
as
opposed
to
sharing
it
with
that
pale
lagerloving
friend
of
mine
mr
sink
its
still
winter
here
in
seattle
but
ill
bet
this
would
be
downright
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
poured
a
straw
gold
with
sodafizzy
carbonation
aroma
was
indistinct
with
some
sourish
notes
flavor
was
muted
with
some
grainy
tartness
that
lent
a
dry
aspect
to
the
beer
a
bit
of
green
grass
but
the
predominent
aspect
was
a
moderated
acidity
that
finished
up
rather
well
can
certainly
hold
its
own
against
domestic
macro
brews
of
the
same
class
drinkability
quite
a
decent
lager
i
thought
i
may
be
inflating
the
scores
a
bit
as
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
mediocre
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
worth
getting
if
youre
eating
indian
food
it
accompanied
the
mulligatawny
soup
naan
and
festival
of
tandoori
meat
i
had
rather
well
the
mouthfeel
starts
off
with
a
sharp
crisp
bite
on
the
tongue
that
fades
to
a
dry
feeling
rather
quickly

theres
not
much
going
on
here
if
it
werent
an
exotic
import
it
might
qualify
as
a
lawnmower
beer
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
the
labels
state
three
times
this
is
slow
brewed
for
the
connoisseur
if
they
mean
us
bas
then
they
are

off

average
sized

diminishing

a
note
of

grassy
slight

some

sugary
slightly
bitter
with
a
touch
of

in

the
beer

the
standard
limpid
light
gold
color
with
the
head
bright
white
and
modest
lace
adequate
to
cover
the
glass
malt
dominated
nose
pleasant
enough
i
guess
with
a
lightly
sweet
taste
at
the
start
the
top
skeletal
and
the
finish
spiteful
in
its
acidity
scarcely
hopped
and
dry
as
the
sun
bleached
sands
of
the
atacama
desert
honey
colored
beer
with
no
lasting
head
toasty
and
malty
aroma
with
no
hops
in
the
nose
malt
diacetyl
toast
and
honey
were
the
flavors
most
dominant
to
me
and
there
was
a
tiny
little
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
nicely
done
the
beer
was
also
a
little
smokey
at
first
i
felt
the
body
was
too
thin
for
the
tastes
though
a
good
beer
with
appropriate
carbonation
bump
up
the
gravity
a
little
and
it
would
be
much
better
i
wish
i
had
read
the
reviews
for
this
before
i
bought
it
pours
light
straw
color
a
little
tiny
white
head
on
the
nose
there
is
a
cooked
veggie
aroma
on
the
palate
the
flavor
just
sucks
cooked
veggies
grassy
husky
grain
little
maltiness
this
is
a
brew
i
would
never
recommend
lucky
me
i
had
a
nice
big
650ml
bottle
buy
at
your
own
risk
one
of
the
palest
lagers
this
side
of
a
silver
bullet
decent
head
a
little
macrolike
but
holds
some
rocky
shapes
smell
of
detergentlike
hops
wow
this
stuff
is
pretty
tasteless
greasy
cornsyrup
maltiness
and
a
nasty
but
light
hop
flavor
thats
as
subtle
as
whackin
your
thumb
with
a
hammer
i
should
have
given
it
a
flash
freeze
down
to
35
degrees
f
one
of
those
beers
you
try
just
so
you
can
say
you
had
a
brew
from
india
3
50
a
bottle
way
too
much
notes
i
dont
suggest
this
beer
at
all
there
are
many
other
subpremium
imported
lagers
that
are
not
only
cheaper
in
price
but
cleaner
and
more
flavourful
this
is
an
uninspired
lager
that
is
probably
imported
primarily
so
well
feel
like
were
complimenting
an
authentic
meal
in
an
indian
restaurant
its
yellow
and
fizzy
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
it
will
work
to
wash
down
a
spicy
lamb
saag
but
just
about
any
inexpensive
lager
will
do
just
as
well
light
yellow
lager
with
no
discernable
head
a
tad
bit
of
lemon
and
spice
on
the
nose
very
light
spice
on
the
finish
but
no
taste
until
then
thin
its
drinkable
like
evian
ick
dissapointing
medium
amber
in
color
with
strong
carbonation
and
medium
head
slightly
fizzy
with
generic
mouthfeel
with
slight
strong
hoppiness
finishes
dry
and
satisfying
for
me
this
is
the
beer
to
drink
with
indian
food
of
course
it
is
good
because
it
made
for
this
type
of
food
it
does
have
a
nice
crispness
to
it
not
much
complexity
though
i
do
drink
this
every
time
i
have
indian
as
it
really
cools
of
the
and
enhances
the
flavors
of
indian
