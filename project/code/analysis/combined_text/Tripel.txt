persistent
foam
cap
that
leaves
thick

driven

palate
large
pitted

with
touches
of

on
a

backbone
with
a

accent
on
the
finish
a
hint
of
cardamom
and
herbs
medium
body
and
medium
to
medium
low
carbonation
from
bottle
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
not
the
best
triple
ive
had
but
not
bad
im
a
big
belgian
fan
this
lacks
the
balance
to
the
sweet
side
that
i
anticipated
id
like
to
find
it
on
tap
to
be
sure
serving
type
bottle
quit
enjoyable
tripel
the
10
alcohol
was
barely
evident
this
is
a
well
done
hop
forward
beer
that
went
down
a
little
too
easy
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
has
a
somewhat
boozy
aftertaste
not
made
as
well
as
i
would
have
hoped
for
but
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
m
medium
body
chewy
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer
but
this
isnt
the
ultimate
tripel
for
myself
wouldnt
turn
this
down
though
for
a
second
and
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
o
this
is
not
your
typical
type
of
tripel
and
is
quite
interesting
as
it
has
some
hop
aromas
and
flavors
that
you
would
expect
to
find
in
an
ipa
but
without
any
bitterness
a
lil
bland
for
such
a
big
beer
but
incredible
deniability
at
its
strength
tastes
a
bit
old
like
some
of
the
flavors
are
faded
but
the
beer
itself
is
very
smooth
i
could
be
wrong
though
initial
sweetness
along
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
dry
finish
with
a
very
mellow
alcohol
bite
reminds
me
of
golden
monkey
a
bit
in
its
simplicity
but
its
dangerous
drinkability
on
that
note
though
i
do
like
it
better
as
theres
a
bit
more
balance
rather
than
the
super
dry
after
taste
that
golden
monkey
has
this
beer
leaves
a
faint
belgian
like
sweetness
lingering
in
the
mouth
reminding
you
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
tripel
and
one
of
the
best
from
a
usa
brewery
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
find
it
o
like
bitting
into
a
tangerine
skin
and
all
dusted
with
some
spice
a
good
belgian
triple
hit
all
the
notes
for
style
which
in
bjcp
doesnt
say
you
have
to
use
continental
hops
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
perhaps
not
traditional
lighter
mouthfeel
medium
light
moderate
carbonation
not
any
resin
but
an
earthy
feel
this
tripel
is
out
of
the
ordinary
but
they
do
specify
that
its
an
american
tripel
and
not
trying
to
imitate
the
belgian
tradition
a
lovely
beer
nothing
wonderfully
sophisticated
except
how
hidden
the
alcohol
is
but
very
nice
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
nice
complex
tripel
with

a

keep

or
share
it
with
a
friend
overall
quite
good
an
interesting
beer
i
find
it
a
bit
hard
to
call
it
a
tripel
really
since
it
is
so
hop
focused
at
least
my
bottle
is
still
tasty
overall
i
dont
know
if
they
are
the
first
to
do
this
but
its
my
first
american
tripel
and
the
captain
does
it
again
i
seriously
love
everything
ive
had
from
them
except
liquid
gold
first
tripel
i
could
say
i
really
liked
almost
loved
the
taste
is
exquisitely
hoppy
with
a
clean
lingering
sweetness
followed
by
an
extended
dry
bitterness
towards
the
end
of
drinking
and
after
most
of
the
beers
incredible
carbonation
has
burned
off
a
lot
more
of
the
malt
comes
forward
but
the
alcohol
will
still
melt
your
eyebrows
off
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
this
beer
drinks
and
its
definitely
a
tasty
tripel
othe
problem
is
that
spices
starts
to
dominate
and
the
hops
are
not
really
there
for
this
american
version
overall
usually
with
tripels
you
expect
the
apples
pears
and
belgian
candy
this
is
insanely
hopped
and
you
seem
to
miss
out
on
the
characteristics
due
to
the
hops
but
they
are
all
still
there
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
its
not
a
traditional
tripel
by
any
means
but
i
am
really
cottoning
to
it
i
just
wish
it
were
more
readily
available
in
my
area
this
one
was
a
gusher
upon
opening
pours
a
cloudy
golden
hue
with
a
huge
white
head
the
nose
is
spicy
with
hints
of
hops
and
light
bready
malt
the
first
sit
is
excellent
the
hops
really
yield
themselves
nicely
to
the
backbone
tripel
flavors
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
interpretation
of
a
tripel
and
drinks
very
easy
for
a
10
beer
recommended
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
one
perhaps
it
was
past
its
prime
but
it
was
not
a
good
representation
of
the
tripel
style
the
rest
of
the
experience
with
the
xtra
gold
was
great
very
flavorful
complex
and
delicious
the
best
captain
lawrence
brew
ive
had
yet
explosive
cracked
the
crown
on
this
and
nearly
half
the
bottle
came
flooding
out
all
over
the
counter
brutally
either
overcarbonated
or
infected
anyway
after
about
five
minutes
of
letting
this
one
air
out
i
poured
a
half
glass
lovely
golden
with
a
fine
white
foam
atop
slightly
herbal
hops
some
nice
sourish
tones
nearly
tart
apple
with
hint
of
lime
tastes
like
a
tripel
with
refined
tones
of
yeast
and
a
really
pleasant
lees
creaminess
medium
bodied
with
lighter
carb
now
nice
beer
wish
it
wasnt
a
brutal
gusher
o
this
beer
really
impressed
me
an
american
tripel
would
have
never
guessed
but
i
love
the
confidence
complex
taste
quite
good
o
not
a
fan
of
funky
beers
and
i
drainpoured
it
really
a
bummer
because
it
seemed
like
it
was
going
to
be
halfway
decent
if
you
like
funky
beers
you
will
probably
love
it
pretty
good
tripel
in
the
american
style
i
hadnt
had
one
of
these
in
a
while
and
this
was
one
of
my
gateway
styles
very
nice
to
see
it
still
alive

its

on

noticed
overall
this
is
definitely
an
excellent
tripel
with
big
fruitiness
and
nice
flavor
balance
d
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
beer
that
respects
its
belgian
roots
while
adding
a
unique
american
interpretation
its
dangerously
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
and
the
flavors
will
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
highly
recommended
despite
the
relatively
high
pricepoint
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
tripel
there
are
definite
true
belgian
tripel
characteristics
in
this
beer
but
the
bitterness
and
light
fruitiness
is
very
american
an
interesting
take
from
a
brewery
i
am
really
enjoying
d
an
exceptional
tripel
all
the
way
around
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
quite
remarkable
none
the
less
i
would
gladly
purchase
another
and
can
recommend
with
a
clear
conscience
to
my
fellow
bas
d
this
is
an
unusually
nice
example
of
the
style
especially
coming
from
an
american
brewery
the
yeast
character
is
as
complex
and
appropriate
as
any
belgian
brewed
tripel
with
plenty
of
thick
malt
to
back
it
up
it
is
sufficiently
dry
to
keep
it
drinkable
and
there
is
just
a
touch
of
herbal
hop
character
in
the
background
to
balance
things
o
i
totally
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
to
date
the
best
damn
tripel
ive
ever
tasted
seriously
highly
impressed
another
quality
brew
by
capt
lawrence
drinkability
i
didnt
read
anything
saying
this
beer
has
any
brett
but
there
is
a
definite
phenolic
funk
that
screams
brettanomyces
nice
malty
notes
of
honey
and
fruit
finish
is
perfect
with
a
balance
of
spice
funk
and
sweet
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
wish
its
flavors
had
a
little
more
cohesiveness
i
think
that
this
beer
can
really
improve
with
some
tweaking
of
the
hops
to
go
a
little
less
citrusy
and
more
floral
and
to
dial
down
the
phenolic
medicinal
components
still
good
job
captain
lawrence
both
this
and
the
reserve
iipa
were
damn
fine
brews
o
very
enjoyable
take
on
the
tripel
in
some
ways
there
was
a
resemblance
to
sofie
from
goose
island
which
is
probably
why
i
enjoyed
this
so
much

pouring
a

also

plenty
of

a
touch
of

the
hops
lend
a
bitterness
while
the
yeast
adds
a
fresh
blend
of
apples
pears

stone
fruit
the
palate
opens
fresh
and
fruity
with
all
pears
and
peaches
making
this
seem
bright
and
vibrant
a
bready
mildly
strawlike
malt
character
is
present
along
with
a
noticeable
honey
character
towards
the
end
of
my

i
get
a
little
more
of
the
phenolic
character
from
the
yeast
drying

mildly
bitter

of
alcohol
this
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
soft
smooth

much
better
than
the

variant
this
is
a
very
good

o
im
not
a
gigantic
fan
of
tripels
to
begin
with
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
im
not
too
interested
in
the
style
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
love
the
hop
flavor
balanced
with
all
the
traditional
aspects
of
a
tripel
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
others
o
interesting
beer

interesting
take
on
this

like
a

this
one
isnt
bad
this

brilliant

a
bit
of
swirling
and
good
pour
releases
amazing
smells
of
what
i
believe
to
be
a
huge
amarillo
dry
hop
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
is
amazing
as
it
is
like
a
very
hoppy
belgian
trippel
and
pretty
much
kicks
you
in
the
mouth
between
the
hops
and
the
booze
this
is
another
wonderful
beer
from
captain
lawrence
the
draft
version
is
as
good
or
better
one
of
my
favorite
captain
lawrence
offerings
the
brewery
is
one
of
the
best
on
the
east
coast
and
very
adept
and
both
american

highly
recommend

going
crazy
about
another
brew
from
captain
lawrence
xtra
gold
is
so
delicious
and
drinkable
as
well
they
need
to
get
to
syracuse
asap
ive
had
this
many
times
at
the
brewery
its
a
staple
at
tasting
room
times
but
i
decided
to
review
it
while
i
enjoy
the
bomber
i
just
opened
been
cleaning
my
house
all
day
took
a
break
to
quench
my
thirst
and
wouldnt
you
know
it
this
bottle
was
peeking
up
at
me
from
the
lower
shelf
on
the
fridge
door
big
pure
white
fluffy
head
on
the
pour
it
was
a
little
too
cold
so
it
was
huge
let
it
settle
but
its
hangin
on
citrus
hops
and
booze
on
the
nose
but
the
fruity
component
is
making
my
mouth
water
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
fruit
all
the
way
through
but
citrus
up
front
and
hops
to
finish
nice
clean
smooth
burn
of
alcohol
this
is
a
fine
beer
captain
lawrence
is
my
friend
now
back
to
cleaning
overall
grade
ba
overall
a
well
made
beer
great
style
fusion
i
wish
i
had
access
to
thisif
i
did
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
alot
complex
enough
to
make
you
want
to
sip
but
refreshing
and
tasty
enough
to
want
to
down
a
whole
glass
great
beer
750ml

this
one
pours

clear
straw
yellowgolden
color
there
was
a
huge
frothy
white
head
on
it
that
last
a
while
and
leaves
some

this
one
has
a
nice
nose
to
it
bready
and
yeasty
up
front
some
spices
and
fruits
coming
through
also
lemon
and
pineapple
nice
silky
feel
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
bready
yeasty
hint
of
pineapple
and
lemon
to
go
with
some
spices
drinks
real
easy
a
nice
tripel
im
not
sure
this
is
an
entirely
successfull
marriage
of
styles
as
im
left
prefering
an
ipa
or
a
tripel
on
their
own
merits
none
the
less
it
is
a
tasty
hybrid
if
you
can
put
expectations
out
of
your
mind
particularly
if
you
are
a
hophead
who
can
enjoy
belgian
styles
though
perhaps
less
so
if
you
are
the
otherwayaround
d
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
for
me
as
tripels
arent
always
my
favorite
not
too
sweet
and
approachable
hop
profile
nice
drinkability
a
drinkable
beer
but
a
cautionary
note
outlined
above
in
mouthfeel
stands
at
10
this
was
a
sipper
that
should
have
perhaps
been
sipped
a
little
faster
but
was
also
fairly
solid
at
the
rate
at
which
i
took
it
truly
looking
forward
to
cracking
the
bottled
version
soon
to
see
both
what
it
looks
like
with
a
year
or
so
of
age
on
it
how
much
of
those
hops
have
faded
and
what
its
like
with
actual
carbonation
regardless
a
great
take
on
an
old
favorite
alcohol
is
well
hidden
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
stylewise
id
say
this
lies
somewhere
between
a
saison
and
a
tripel
an
easy
drinker
its
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
come
by
as
i
dont
get
the
captain
down
here
in
cincy
but
i
am
impressed
with
my
first
offering
from
them
will
be
seeking
out
some
brews
in
the
future
overall
nice
but
may
have
to
revisit

d
for
how
yeasty

different
enough
to
keep
things
fresh

me
overall
no
problems
thumbs
up
for
this
hazy
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
quickly
settled
to
a
thin
film
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
not
really
belgium
in
appearance
really
hoppy
aroma
of
citrus
i
have
a
hard
time
detecting
any
belgian
qualities
in
the
aroma
pale
malt
is
the
only
other
player
in
the
aroma
it
does
smell
inviting
with
the
american
hops
these
american
hops
dominate
the
flavor
and
that
hurts
the
overall
score
of
this
beer
the
belgian
malt
and
yeast
do
their
best
to
overcome
the
hops
but
fall
short
of
doing
something
great
the
belgian
qualities
do
make
their
appearance
near
the
finish
with
some
nice
clove
and
vinous
qualities
bitterness
is
very
high
for
a
tripel
but
knowing
this
is
an
american
intrerpation
of
the
style
it
seems
appropriate
medium
body
with
peppy
carbonation
helps
lift
this
hoppy
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
too
hoppy
with
american
hops
to
work
but
at
the
same
time
those
hops
are
quite
flavorfull
and
adds
its
own
charactor
drinkability
at
around
10
this
is
a
pretty
awesome
sipper
i
feel
like
i
may
have
recently
had
a
brew
like
this
not
an
overly
hopped
american
version
of
the
style
but
something
thats
less
heavy
on
the
belgian
characteristics
but
still
imparts
enough
to
give
full
credit
to
the
original
style
another
stellar
brew
from
a
brewery
that
i
continue
to
be
impressed
with
d
fairly
high
boozy
but
very
tasty
this
onell
sneak
up
on
you
as
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
ill
be
buying
more
when
i
go
back
to
ny
one
of
the
better
us
tripels
ive
come
across
avoids
being
too
sweet
or
syrupy
i
really
like
this
beer
and
was
surprised
at
how
high
it
scored
when
the
dust
settled
a
pretty
good
beer
d
wow
definitely
doesnt
taste
like
10
abv
more
than
drinkable
doesnt
have
the
typical
banana
and
clove
tripel
taste
but
it
works
quite
well
the
way
it
is
drinkability
good
man
i
love
all
things
sweet
fill
me
up
with
chocolate
maple
syrup
ice
cream
but
this
just
too
sweet
pretty
good
but
i
can
feel
my
dentist
laughing
every
time
i
take
a
swig
too
sweet
d
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
not
a
terrible
beer
but
a
pretty
mediocre
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
the
carbonation
was
especially
off
below
average
750
from
manchester
wine
manchester
ct
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
captain
lawrence
continues
to
impress
me
and
i
recommend
trying
this
out
as
soon
as
you
can
worthy
cheers
d
decent
tripel
with
a
well
hidden
abv
so
be
careful
would
definitely
recommend
it
this
is
a
bit
of
a
tough
beer
to
review
because
its
not
a
typical
tripel
but
it
wasnt
intended
to
be
still
i
expected
it
to
resemble
a
tripel
a
bit
more
while
adding
some
hop
character
instead
it
doesnt
bring
the
sweetness
and
yeast
complexity
that
i
had
expected
it
drinks
as
a
pretty
simple
beer
which
is
why
even
if
i
blur
style
guidelines
in
my
mind
it
still
is
just
a
good
one
and
doesnt
really
come
very
close
to
being
great
regardless
of
style
more
complexity
would
have
been
nice
particularly
if
it
were
yeast
derived
a
pretty
good
beer
but
there
are
better
american
made
tripels
out
there
d
yum
what
is
most
striking
about
this
beer
is
that
although
it
changes
drastically
in
flavor
as
the
temperature
rises
the
peaks
and
valleys
becoming
more
and
more
dramatic
with
each
degree
its
damn
damn
tasty
throughout
the
spectrum
served
it
around
40
degrees
a
bit
cold
and
drank
routinely
up
through
room
temperature
awesome
beer
the
whole
way
up
overall
i
was
pleased
with
this
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
a
lot
of
american
tripels
although
it
is
sweeter
than
the
belgian
examples
worth
trying
this
one
was
a
gusher
way
over
carbonated
popped
the
cap
and
14
the
bottle
was
all
over
the
marble
no
lacing
fruity
aroma
flavor
isnt
right
for
a
triple
hops
are
adding
a
lont
but
in
the
wrong
way
mouthfeel
suffers
from
the
heavy
carbonation
as
well
as
does
the
drinkability
wasnt
particularly
crazy
about
this
one
give
me
curieux
adequately
carbonated
with
a
spritzy
and
peppery
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
americanbelgian
pale
aletripel
mix
captain
lawrence
suggested
drinking
this
out
of
a
goblet
i
did
but
since
i
always
enjoy
my
tripels
in
tulips
i
had
my
second
glass
out
of
a
la
chouffe
tulip
i
thought
the
presentation
the
nose
where
superior
when
it
was
in
the
tulip
glass
the
taste
maybe
it
was
more
psychological
also
tasted
much
better
in
the
tulip
i
say
go
with
a
tulip
glass
instead
d
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
didnt
think
it
smelled
or
tasted
too
much
like
a
tripel
but
it
had
some
notes
of
that
style
in
each
lots
of
bananas
citrus
and
fruity
malts
would
try
again
f
finishes
with
a
lingering
hot
booze
with
spicy
booze
some
sticky
sweetness
but
mostly
dry
some
lingering
belgian
malts
and
tripel
like
flavors
a
slight
rustic
flavor
too
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
good
tripel
if
thats
what
you
were
wanting
to
drink
worth
trying
if
its
around
dont
trade
for
it
d
this
is
a
solid
tripel
not
as
spicy
as
i
like
but
still
quite
good
d
incredibly
drinkable
for
10
abv
nothing
in
the
flavor
aroma
or
mouthfeel
is
overpowering
i
will
definitely
finish
this
750ml
tonight
and
im
sure
it
will
leave
me
feeling
good
drinkability
very
complex
i
like
the
dryness
of
this
tripel
and
the
tropical
fruit
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
this
is
a
one
per
sitting
beer
as
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
very
worth
the
price
poured
into
a
chalice
a
cloudy
golden

nice

huge

which
finally
settles
down
to

with

medium

brew
d
very
easy
to
down
a
couple
of
six
ounce
pours
of
this
tripel
the
10
abv
xtra
gold
is
a
pretty
harmonious
marriage
of
the
american
ipa
and
belgian
tripel
just
the
right
amount
of
funky
spicy
belgian
yeast
strain
character
to
go
along
with
those
pungent
and
citrusy
yet
balanced
hop
influences
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
by
no
means
great
drink
a
straffe
hendrik
brugse
tripel
instead
youll
thank
me
overall
a
fair
approximation
of
a
belgian
tripel
but
falls
well
short
of
the
best
in
the
style
and
well
short
of
my
expectations
from
this
brewer
based
on
their
other
beers
ive
tried
it
has
a
lot
of
the
elements
for
a
good
tripel
but
somehow
it
doesnt
quite
come
together
for
me
now
that
ive
posted
this
review
and
see
how
highly
this
is
rated
i
can
only
assume
theres
some
variation
bottle
to
bottle
overall
this
is
another
quality
beer
from
captain
lawrence
sours
seem
to
be
their
specialty
but
based
on
this
beer
it
looks
like
they
can
probably
do
a
pretty
good
job
with
any
style
they
brew
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
this
tripel
and
i
will
probably
seek
out
some
of
their
other
brews
also
if
you
like
strong
sours
then
youll
love
their
rosso
e
marrone
quality
brewery
i
really
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
a
mess
but
it
is
extremely
well
balanced
for
all
the
flavors
definitely
will
go
back
for
more
overall
its
pretty
impressive
especially
taking
into
account
the
american
twist
on
the
tripel
style
its
an
easy
drinker
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
unique
take
on
the
style
to
me
it
was
like
a
blend
of
a
tripel
saison
and
belgian
ipa
it
is
a
bit
too
peppery
for
my
liking
but
i
still
kept
reaching
for
the
glass
out
of
curiosity
cheers
to
cuzco
for
sending
this
bottle
along
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
the
fluffy
white
cap
is
initially
impressive
3
fingers
or
so
and
leaves
plenty
of
lace
but
retention
is
poor
the
nose
is
primarily
of
lemonorange
citrus
notes
from
the
hops
with
some
clove
and
traditional
yeast
spiciness
there
as
well
the
taste
is
largely
a
blend
of
the
same
and
the
problem
with
both
is
that
the
balance
is
too
far
tilited
towards
the
hops
the
bottle
refers
itself
as
an
american
tripel
and
the
beer
is
just
a
little
too
much
american
hops
and
not
enough
traditional
belgian
tripel
flavor
to
live
up
to
its
billing
the
beer
has
a
nice
body
to
it
suitably
creamy
but
its
noticeably
undercarbonated
the
best
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
its
drinkability
as
the
hops
are
focused
on
flavor
rather
than
bitterness
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
a
presence
i
appreciate
what
captain
lawrence
was
going
for
but
for
my
money
they
went
to
far
in
mixing
american
hops
and
belgian
style
d
although
it
has
a
high
abv
it
still
comes
across
as
refreshing
with
crispness
and
high
carbonation
d
this
was
a
good
drinker
but
after
one
glass
i
was
ready
to
jump
into
something
else
look
forward
to
drinking
this
again
but
just
not
back
to
back
nice
beer
overall
though
would
recommend
this
isnt
a
huge
old
belgian
strain
tripel
this
is
a
more
subdues
and
drinkable
american
take
on
the
style
and
it
works
well
here
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
below
average
for
the
style
but
fits
well
the
body
is
thick
and
sugary
with
an
almost
grainy
feel
to
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
one
bottle
is
plenty
for
right
now
but
ill
get
it
again
m
d
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
best
points
of
this
beer
i
found
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
an
active
carbonation
and
absolutely
no
stickiness
which
works
well
for
the
sweet
flavours
it
keeps
them
in
check
and
doesnt
make
anything
seem
cloying
though
i
dont
think
that
would
happen
anyways
honestly
alcohol
is
barely
noticed
with
just
that
little
bit
of
spiciness
adding
to
the
mix
quite
nicely
done
and
a
good
choice
for
evening
sipping
overall
impression
a
fine
tripel
and
certainly
worth
seeking
out
quality
craft
brew
from
the
capt
fresh
and
clean
characters
aid
in
the
enjoyment
of
this
brew
great
twist
with
the
additions
of
amarillo
hops
and
increased
sweet
malts
great
to
see
brewers
taking
there
craft
to
outter
boundaries
cant
wait
for
distribution
to
massachusetts
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
brew
almost
too
easy
a
unique
take
on
an
american
tripel
that
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
in
regards
to
both
flavor
and
body
appearance
is
average
pale
and
cloudy
golden
with
a
short
lasting
cream
head
aroma
is
sweet
solvent
and
tonicy
age
has
taken
edge
off
the
hop
bitterness
but
the
hops
are
still
much
more
present
than
expected
for
the
style
and
provide
some
of
the
sweetness
flavors
of
ripe
fruit
apple
pear
lime
some
tropical
flavors
and
a
lingering
dry
and
sweet
finish
hard
to
get
an
objective
take
on
the
body
and
mouthfeel
with
the
extremely
sharp
fine
carbonation
alcohol
is
still
present
and
warming
throughout
even
with
the
at
least
year
age
despite
the
negatives
i
still
found
this
to
be
an
interesting
blend
of
flavors
but
this
is
the
most
disappointing
beer
ive
had
from
cl
so
far
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
nice
drinking
belgian
inspired
beer
the
citrus
and
fruit
flavors
went
very
well
with
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
and
helped
make
it
more
drinkable
probably
one
of
the
best
triples
ive
had
so
far
otherwise
a
decent
medium
bodied
pour
not
a
bad
tripel
for
the
americans
but
this
is
a
field
i
believe
theyve
still
to
master
smooth
malty
and
balanced
the
peppery
spice
is
again
present
on
the
palate
but
is
matched
by
a
sweet
and
tart
lemonadelike
quality
there
is
a
little
warmth
going
down
but
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
carbonation
is
soft
there
is
a
bubble
gum
quality
that
comes
in
at
the
end
but
overall
the
beer
finishes
dry
delicious
and
well
rounded
d
smooth
again
and
light
for
a
such
a
strong
beer
im
not
crazy
about
belgians
and
this
one
is
very
similar
so
i
could
have
a
glass
but
thats
probably
it
oh
boy
my
first
review
been
a
beer
geek
for
a
while
and
have
known
about
ba
for
some
time
thought
it
was
time
to
start
rating
cheers
all
nice
i
like
a
good
surprise
one
in
a
while
and
this
one
really
shocked
me
with
how
good
it
was
well
balanced
with
a
fresh
hoppy
vibrancy
to
it
and
a
killer
feel
and
drinkibility
for
the
size
im
glad
that
this
is
one
of
the
easier
captain
selections
to
find
ill
definitely
be
revisiting
this
again
in
the
future
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
take
on
a
trippel
that
i
thouroughly
enjoy
reminds
me
of
a
stone
calibelgique
i
wouldnt
grab
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
classic
trippel
but
if
you
enjoy
beer
and
outofthebox
beers
youll
probably
enjoy
this
one
i
always
enjoy
the
cl
offerings
drinkability
very
good
for
a
strong
sugary
brew
i
think
the
hops
and
the
mouthfeel
are
helping
here
drinkability
i
have
been
sitting
on
this
bottle
for
a
year
maybe
two
which
i
imagine
has
reduced
the
hoppy
bitterness
a
notch
perhaps
that
adds
to
the
enjoyment
as
a
lot
of
the
fruity
complexity
is
able
to
join
with
the
bitterness
neverthelss
this
is
not
a
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
in
quantity
as
the
fruit
and
citrus
tend
to
wear
out
the
tastebuds
after
a
while
drinkability
drinks
very
light
for
such
high
alcohol
level
this
is
going
to
sneak
up
on
me
later
but
i
would
go
back
for
a
second
bottle
in
a
heartbeat
very
nice
beer
seek
this
out
d
pretty
good
a
nice
american
version
of
the
style
the
appearance
is
a
cloudy
golden
straw
color
with
a
full
white
fluffy
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
breadymusty
clove
and
sweet
yeasty
malt
the
flavor
is
very
consistent
with
the
aroma
i
get
orange
and
lemon
highlights
as
well
at
first
there
is
a
metallic
edge
but
it
disipates
quickly
with
a
little
warming
its
well
carbonated
finely
and
bites
the
tongue
with
tart
citrus
clove
there
is
plenty
of
rye
bread
in
this
midbodied
beauty
with
lots
of
fine
suspension
refreshing
fairly
drinkable
if
you
like
the
style
this
does
better
as
it
warms
and
ultimately
is
a
slightly
muted
and
enjoyable
version
of
a
typical
belgian
trippel
it
has
some
guts
a
bit
of
alcohol
a
good
entry
from
the
quality
crew
at
captain
lawrence
overall
i
am
glad
i
am
splitting
this
one
with
friends
i
could
hardly
finish
my
glass
of
this
it
just
wasnt
my
type
of
triple
the
alcohol
presence
in
this
beer
is
certainly
there
but
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
drinkability
in
fact
it
enhances
the
flavor
character
of
the
hop
additions
and
helps
to
create
interesting
floral
aromas
for
its
10
heft
extremely
drinkable
almost
quaffable
that
is
until
you
stand

for
the
chance
to
try
it

a

taste
consistent
with

lacking
some
of
the
sweetness
that
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
hops
bittering
in
the
mix
mouthfeel

mediumlight
with
a
carbonation

just
shy
of
lively
some
astringency
and
fairly
dry
finishing
pretty
delicious
tripel
and
top
notch
on
draft
lacking
some
of
the
sweetness
typical
of
the
style
but
i
actually
think
that
enhances
its
drinkability
well
done
captain
lawrence
very
well
balanced
with
a
lot
of
estery
belgian
yest
notes
and
amarillo
hops
earthy
hop
bitterness
balances
out
the
crisp
light
fruit
notes
apple
and
pear
along
with
some
grape
notes
nice
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
alcohol
well
masked
making
it
quite
quaffable
well
this
takes
some
xtra
time
to
consume
and
on
a
night
where
i
wanted
to
drink
a
lot
i
still
took
my
time
with
it
not
as
bold
as
other
examples
but
i
guess
the
slight
alcohol
taste
combined
with
a
odd
yeast
strain
makes
the
taste
hurt
a
bit
and
maybe
cuts
down
on
the
fruits
true
cababilities
i
would
suggest
spliting
this
with
a
friend
if
you
can
find
one
d
easy
sipping
beer
and
very
nice
for
the
fall
medium

a
bit
over
carbonated
but
still
nice

pour

please
d
very
drinkable
another
winner
from
cl
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
tripels
out
there
an
excellent
tripel
with
a
complex
and
wellintegrated
taste
that
brings
a
bunch
of
different
elements
together
extremely
well
highly
recommended
cheers
a
750ml
bottle
one
of
at
least
a
dozen
ive
had
of
this
beer
this
particular
bottle
was
shared
by
psycohops
thanks
bob
poured
into
a
matching
pair
of
basic
tulip
glasses
the
tripel
appears
a
crystal
clear
rich
golden
yellow
color
with
at
least
two
fingers
of
fluffy
cloudlike
off
white
foam
the
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
fresh
citrus
hops
such
as
tangerine
and
orange
tropical
fruits
melon
apples
spicy
yeast
great
sweet
malt
balance
a
bit
of
black
pepper
and
some
white
grapes
an
awesome
hoppy
american
tripel
the
ale
is
just
as
good
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
a
notch
or
two
better
than
medium
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
high
abv
great
stuff
d
a
nicely
hopped
triple
the
american
hops
do
nothing
but
help
add
dimension
to
a
trully
strong
almost
boozy
tripel
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
would
have
to
take
my
time
if
consuming
a
bottle
hv
m
d
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
but
it
goes
well
with
the
belgian
candi
sugars
and
fruitiness
drinkability
is
alright
the
alcohol
is
defiantly
a
defining
factor
here
i
poured
the
xtra
gold
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
the
appearance
is
a
medium
hazy
yellow
with
a
large
frothy
head
it
smells
of
citrus
and
some
light
spice
taking
a
sip
i
taste
grapefruit
hops
and
some
of
the
malt
it
tastes
very
very
good
and
it
is
a
great
tripel
from
the
u
s
which
is
not
always
the
end
result
of
this
style
from
u
s
brewers
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
hoppy
some
of
that
warm
alcohol
comes
through
as
well
but
for
10
xtra
gold
is
by
no
means
overpowering
drinkability
is
there
on
this
spectacular
beer
from
captain
lawrence
very
glad
that
i
picked
up
this
bottle
after
finally
making
the
trip
down
to
see
their
brewery
in
person
i
really
like
this
beer
and
its
a
perfect
compliment
to
a
warm
summer
day
picked
up
a
750
capped
bottle
at
new
beer
distributors
in
the
bowery
i
like
it
when
labels
tell
the
truth
and
this
really
does
taste
like
an
americanstyle
tripel
its
more
crisp
and
fresh
with
juicy
citrus
hops
rounding
out
a
more
traditional
spice
and
pepper
malt
and
yeast
flavor
sometimes
us
brewers
try
to
put
their
own
american
spin
on
a
belgian
but
the
beer
just
comes
out
too
plain
this
beer
doesnt
do
any
of
that
it
takes
the
best
of
both
worlds
making
for
a
delicious
and
satisfying
beer
ill
also
note
that
fans
of
hoppy
belgians
should
look
to
this
beer
overall
a
really
good
tripel
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
especially
to
fans
of
hoppier
belgianstyle
brews
this
is
a
refreshing
good
beer
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
solid
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
warming
alcohol
and
fruity
yeast
ester
aroma
there
is
a
bit
of
citrus
and
an
earthy
undertone
the
taste
is
exceptional
it
has
a
very
nice
pale
malt
flavor
thats
warming
the
yeast
adds
a
ton
of
character
it
has
an
awesome
fruitiness
with
a
dry
earthy
finish
its
also
quite
bitter
im
guessing
chinook
hops
because
of
the
grapefruit
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
drinking
tripel
its
loaded
with
taste
and
aroma
a
well
brewed
beer
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
ahold
of
it
zesty
yet
dry

the

wow
maybe
the
best
american
beer
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
masterpiece
right
up
there
with
cls
noreaster
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
it
needed
to
be
a
little
more
delicate
with
the
spice
and
alcohol
as
they
do
get
cloying
not
terrible
d
excellent
great
balance
between
hoppy
spicy
and
sweet
i
found
it
hard
to
detect
any
alcohol
and
i
was
shocked
when
i
went
to
enter
my
review
and
i
saw
that
this
weighs
in
at
10
abv
taste
is
sweet
spicy
cloves
caramel
malt
yeasty
breadiness
and
a
very
distinct
dry
hoppy
mint
tropical
pineapple
unique
and
delicious
finished
dry
crisp
minty
hop
bitterness
very
easy
drinking
beer
im
not
a
stickler
for
beer
styles
so
i
can
accept
this
beer
as
an
american
tripel
and
just
enjoy
it
interesting
beer
i
like
it
but
dont
love
it
i
put
this
with
calibelgique
and
le
freak
for
me
le
freak
is
solidly
the
best
with
xtra
gold
way
ahead
of
stone
calibelgique
a
nice
american
version
of
the
tripel
a
great
one
to
keep
around
and
change
pace
from
traditional
belgians
not
as
in
your
face
as
a
bipa
and
therefore
a
wonderful
surprise
for
all
who
partake
get
two
bottles
as
one
is
a
tease
d
great
sipper
compelling
nose
balanced
taste
d
as
far
as
sheer
drinkability
goes
after
at
least
6
months
the
abv
is
very
subdues
and
barely
noticeable
making
this
very
deceptive
the
flavors
of
this
brew
are
very
goodand
very
soft
if
chilled
its
best
to
let
this
warm
a
bit
before
drinkingotherwise
you
are
doing
yourself
a
disservice
its
very
good
but
very
soft
so
i
really
didnt
taste
much
during
the
first
glass
which
was
slightly
chilled
another
wonderful
brew
by
captain
lawrence
overall
for
a
triple
this
was
fantastically
drinkable
no
hints
of
alcohol
at
all
and
really
just
amazingly
complex
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
as
i
heard
it
is
mind
blowing
this
is
one
that
needs
to
be
sought
out
d
very
drinkable
for
a
10
beer
d
clean
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
however
cl
has
put
out
better
beers
d
i
was
pleasently
surprised
by
this
beer
the
boottle
describes
it
as
an
american
triple
it
is
a
fitting
description
as
it
takes
the
best
of
the
belgium
style
triple
and
puts
a
good
old
american
spin
on
it
i
thought
it
was
very
balanced
between
the
fruity
sweetness
and
floral
hops
it
definatly
stand
out
in
its
catagory
for
me
and
a
joy
to
drink
i
will
be
picking
up
a
few
more
next
time
im
at
whole
foods
cheers
d
i
found
this
to
be
quite
a
complex
tripel
with
a
noticeable
hop
presence
nothing
really
overpowered
the
flavor
profile
making
this
a
wellbalanced
brew
that
was
easy
to
drink
oh
and
the
bottle
art
pictured
here
is
quite
old
d
a
great
belgian
style
american
beer
warm
spicy
great
hopping
that
stands
out
and
good
cola
flavor
great
yeast
bite
compliments
an
already
good
beer
definitely
a
recommend
taste
is
a
perfect
balance
of
belgian
and
ipa
this
is
the
first
of
the
style
that
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
hops
are
very
citrusy
and
work
well
in
this
tripel
plenty
of
carbonation
and
bitterness
in
the
hops
that
create
a
wonderful
mouth
feel
wonderful
beer
and
you
never
notice
the
10
abv
i
could
drink
this
regularly
very
well
done
and
enjoyable
smoke
from
the
oak
to
follow
im
pretty
sure
this
bottle
has
been
sitting
in
a
warehouse
for
a
while
because
the
hop
flavors
are
not
nearly
as
intense
as
noted
by
others
but
thats
the
beauty
of
it
while
the
hop
flavors
have
become
less
intense
over
time
its
still
a
damned
fine
tripel
i
hope
to
get
a
taste
of
this
fresh
in
the
near
future
notes
from
22007
excellent
aroma
of
spices
apple
apricot
quaff
just
mirrors
these
and
adds
a
sturdy
malt
backbone
a
touch
of
hops
still
kick
in
the
finish
well
carbonated
and
sips
like
a
dream
no
hint
of
the
high
power
abv
maybe
its
the
aging
but
this
is
a
topnotch
tripel
american
style
d
westcoast
hoppy
take
on
the
triple
style
captain
lawrences
pale
ales
are
ver
popular
and
this
creation
has
some
cross
pollination
to
the
triple
more
spicey
and
light
than
the
full
body
and
sweeter
versions
this
is
a
beer
that
i
have
heard
good
things
about
it
pours
a
cloudy
yellowgold
with
a
gigantic
white
frothy
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
the
smell
is
pungent
with
bananaclovescitrus
scentswheatand
pepper
the
taste
is
very
crisp
with
a
bitter
hop
and
citrus
lemon
flavor
there
are
also
lemonpepperbananaclovesand
some
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
good
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
tamebut
the
citrus
flavor
is
fantastic
the
mf
is
light
for
a
high
octane
brew
which
makes
this
a
very
good
beer
its
my
first
from
this
brewerybut
it
wont
be
the
last
da
very
interesting
take
on
the
tripel
style
very
american
in
the
liberal
use
of
hops
but
with
all
the
classic
hallmarks
of
the
style
i
have
had
this
on
tap
a
few
times
before
without
reviewing
it
but
i
have
to
say
i
am
glad
to
have
that
i
havent
the
bottled
version
is
superior
d
really
great
beer
the
orange
flavor
on
this
beer
makes
it
amazing
i
have
a
2006
in
the
cellar
this
one
might
be
better
fresh
and
you
would
loose
the
wonderful
hop
taste
xtra
gold
is
very
nice
more
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
then
a
true
tripel
this
belgian
ipa
is
very
very
tasty
regardless
of
style
well
worth
sampling
if
a
fan
of
belgians
or
ipas
d
certainly
a
unique
brew
with
a
distinct
flavor
profile
that
doesnt
quite
fit
into
any
one
category
i
enjoyed
it
though
i
usually
dont
enjoy
the
style
notes
when
i
decided
to
step
it
up
a
notch
at
the
cask
fest
i
picked
this
one
and
it
was
in
among
the
top
5
for
the
night
this
was
a
tripel
i
could
sip
slowly
and
would
want
to
share
a
bottle
with
12
others
if
i
can
get
a
fresher
sample
ill
rereview
this
thanks
to
eehaicj
for
sharing
d
a
heavy
and
heady
brew
but
i
drank
most
of
a
growler
by
myself
anyway
not
sure
if
this
says
more
about
me
or
the
beer
i
am
having
this
with
lunch
on
a
workday
which
might
be
a
mistake
because
a
750
of
10
which
is
extremely
well
hidden
might
make
for
a
very
unproductive
afternoon
but
what
can
i
do
now
its
open
i
have
one
more
of
these
i
am
cherishing
now
i
think
xtra
gold
is
my
favorite
from
captain
lawrence
so
far
after
only
5
or
6
of
their
beers
i
love
the
twist
they
put
on
this
tripel
with
the
amarillo
addition
im
going
to
try
and
get
my
hands
on
more
of
these
bottles
because
theyre
damn
good
thanks
again
shannon
drinks
too
well
while
thiere
is
a
slight
alcohol
bite
it
doesnt
show
its
true
abv
intil
the
tongue
gets
numb
even
after
slowsipping
halfway
through
the
bottle
this
is
interesting
not
a
true
example
of
a
tripel
but
it
wasnt
meant
to
be
an
american
invention
with
a
nod
to
the
belgians
as
claimed
on
the
label
doesnt
matter
its
so
unusual
and
changing
that
my
written
notes
are
in
a
mess
its
one
of
those
that
i
like
more
for
its
uniquenessinventiveness
that
works
than
as
something
i
would
regularly
purchase
unique
and
interesting
an
american
twist
in
a
heavyhanded
way
to
a
broadly
fitting
in
with
a
belgian
tripel
inspirated
brew
pours
a
foggy
sunset
orange
hue
with
a
full
two
finger
pillowy
white
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
soft
layer
of
foam
nice
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
pretty
hoppy
up
front
i
guess
thats
why
scott
calls
it
an
american
tripel
sweet
grapefruit
honey
and
yeast
in
the
nose
to
begin
with
some
apple
and
pear
combined
with
faint
pepper
and
spice
as
well
sweet
fruit
flavors
consisting
of
pear
tangerine
and
white
grapes
at
first
midway
the
breadlike
characteristics
emerge
with
the
yeasts
and
pale
malts
aftertaste
is
a
touch
dry
with
honey
grapefruit
lemongrass
and
lingering
alcohol
best
tasting
tripel
that
i
have
experienced
by
far
soft
medium
body
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
the
10
abv
is
hidden
extremely
well
be
careful
with
this
one
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
and
i
havent
tried
too
many
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
overall
tripel
ive
sampled
im
thinking
because
its
hopped
up
but
hey
thats
the
hophead
in
me
hell
of
a
beer
get
your
hands
on
this
one
for
sure
an
interesting
american
take
on
the
style
and
a
good
bottle
to
split
with
a
friend
very
enjoyable
bottle
courtesy
of
beerlando
poured
a
deep
golden
and
lightly
hazy
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
amarillo
hops
with
a
medium
sweet
malt
base
with
some
light
fruity
ester
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
light
fruity
ester
with
some
mediumsweet
malt
base
and
a
hoppy
finish
which
kind
of
detract
from
the
fine
mal
base
full
body
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
interesting
and
different
take
from
the
classic
belgian
style
but
in
the
end
the
finish
is
too
dry
and
hoppy
to
raise
this
beer
to
classic
level
i
thought
this
one
was
very
tasty
and
refreshing
despite
the
high
alcohol
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
chunky
cap
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
tropical
fruit
light
lemon
tart
apple
and
booze
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
quick
shot
of
bitter
hops
which
is
quickly
neutralized
by
a
sugary
lemon
sweetnes
and
tart
apple
the
brew
also
has
a
tin
like
metal
flavor
the
feel
is
moderate
and
quite
fizzy
there
is
a
good
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
finishes
with
a
slight
belly
burn
this
beer
definitely
gets
better
as
you
drink
it
at
first
the
mix
of
flavors
seemed
to
be
a
mess
but
as
i
got
through
the
glass
the
flavors
came
together
a
very
good
tripel
not
cloying
or
overly
sugary
drinkability
is
good
a
very
nice
american
take
on
the
belgian
tripel
i
am
glad
i
got
to
drink
this
one
quite
tasty
and
well
worth
trying
this
batch
was
not
as
well
integrated
and
due
to
the
fact
that
less
amarillo
was
used
was
not
nearly
as
aromatic
and
hoppy
it
was
still
funky
and
good
though
i
much
prefer
the
new
batch
by
the
time
i
finished
my
pint
i
was
completely
blown
away
this
immediately
became
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
said
i
had
it
again
a
few
days
later
at
barcade
and
it
was
overly
lemony
in
both
nose
and
taste
and
the
body
wasnt
as
impressive
not
sure
if
this
was
from
batch
variation
or
handling
or
tap
lines
or
what
but
that
one
i
had
at
the
ginger
man
came
pretty
close
to
the
perfect
pint
d
nice
and
rich
light
body
and
a
big
punch
this
is
a
refreshing
unique
brew
that
is
entertaining
and
worth
a
long
session
notes
not
sure
what
the
big
deal
about
this
one
is
decent
stuff
but
nothing
special
over
all
a
decent
beer
that
i
recall
being
much
better
in
the
bottle
ill
have
to
go
back
and
test
a
bottle
again
when
i
get
a
chance
for
only
5
a
glass
at
spuyten
duyvil
its
definitely
worth
a
try
thanks
go
out
to
scootny
for
this
one
pours
a
foggy
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
spiced
with
some
citrus
and
a
pleasant
tone
of
alcohol
lemon
is
definitely
there
flavor
is
spiced
and
funky
slight
alcohol
its
pretty
tangy
nice
feel
to
it
good
liquid
body
and
a
biting
and
distinct
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
tripel
its
a
bit
hot
but
still
well
made
beer
poured
a
light
golden
body
with
a
medium
white
head
nice
lacing
and
ring
on
the
edge
there
was
a
pleasing
citrus
note
that
mirrored
the
taste
as
well
the
nose
and
taste
also
had
definite
tones
of
hops
bitterness
as
well
balancing
this
all
out
was
a
present
but
not
overpowering
malty
sweetness
i
also
detected
some
peach
notes
in
the
taste
as
well
overall
a
solid
beer
it
matched
perfectly
with
a
roasted
salmon
on
lemons
drinkability
is
moderate
this
is
a
peculiar
beer
that
seems
to
be
a
bit
offstyle
with
the
high
hop
presence
that
is
compounded
by
overcarbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
but
a
bit
disappointing
from
what
ive
heard
about
cl
either
way
i
definitely
look
forward
to
trying
more
styles
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
drinkability
complex
flavor
but
nice
finish
this
beer
hides
its
strength
well
if
looks
are
any
indication
of
the
high
price
than
i
can
certainly
understand
one
of
the
best
appearances
i
have
seen
in
the
style
with
a
golden
colored
hue
that
included
obvious
carbonation
and
a
gigantic
foamy
and
frothy
head
with
immense
staying
power
the
head
was
absolutely
huge
and
actually
kept
rising
instead
of
shrinking
and
then
just
proceeded
to
sit
on
top
of
the
goldencolored
brew
the
smell
was
very
spritzy
with
citrus
and
lemonlike
nuances
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
authentic
belgianlike
brews
i
have
come
across
or
tried
that
have
actually
been
americanmade
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
many
fantome
beers
that
i
have
sampled
with
an
apparent
champagnelike
characteristic
and
pepperessence
and
less
of
the
sweet
candied
flavors
that
are
in
other
depictions
of
the
style
mouthfeel
was
very
thick
rich
and
creamy
with
a
candiedflavor
certainly
noticeable
drinkability
was
good
and
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
detect
behind
an
amazing
conglomeration
of
rich
flavors
it
only
took
a
hit
due
to
the
hefty
10
abv
otherwise
an
outstanding
brew
definitely
recommended
this
one
is
worth
a
repeat
in
my
book
drink
yeah
could
in
fact
did
finish
this
750
myself
nice
would
certainly
like
more
and
im
sure
i
would
have
the
same
tastes
and
experience
from
first
sip
to
last
not
near
as
good
as
their
cuvee
de
castleton
but
most
of
their
beers
probably
are
not
this
is
one
hoppy
tripel
a
nice
american
mix
of
a
belgian
beer
indeed
recommended
if
you
can
make
a
trip
to
the
brewery
or
get
in
a
trade
not
too
bad
overall
overcarbonation
might
have
occured
at
the
time
of
bottling
or
it
might
be
due
to
faulty
bottle
conditioning
in
any
case
captain
lawrence
brewings
xtra
gold
tripel
ale
is
a
disappointment
relative
to
expectations
maybe
this
years
batch
will
be
better
another
great
captain
lawrence
this
yummy
hybrid
of
a
bitter
ipa
and
yeastiness
looked
good
smelled
good
and
tasted
great
so
what
the
person
i
shared
this
with
and
supper
thought
it
overly
hoppy
and
likes
sweeter
belgiums
more
for
me
very
drinkable
creaminess
from
the
yeast
which
starts
sweet
and
then
gives
a
good
controlled
bitterness
from
the
tasty
amarillo
i
gotta
say
that
i
wanted
to
take
a
sip
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
and
smelled
the
wonderful
aroma
i
am
a
big
fan
of
captain
lawrence
and
scott
vaccaro
it
was
a
big
plus
for
our
area
when
scott
moved
back
to
ny
state
such
a
wonderful
ale
big
thanks
to
erikthered
for
hooking
me
up
wonderful
citrus
nose
and
flavor
sweet
taste
upfront
with
a
pleasantly
bitter
taste
on
the
back
end
lots
of
grapefruit
taste
very
interesting
beer
alcohol
taste
was
a
bit
too
present
a
very
unique
beer
definitely
worth
trying
i
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
other
dank
beers
from
this
fine
captain

is

and
lightly

taste
is
malt
sweetness
upfront
dpicing
in
the
middle
and
a
warming
alcohol
close
that
radiates
down
the
throat
as
it
goes
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
on
par
with
the
style
not
liking
this
one
quite
as
much
as
the
first
time
around
but
still
a
good
tip
belgian
style
ipa
or
american
tripel
it
boils
down
to
a
basic
brew
thats
blended
enough
to
come
off
as
nicely
complex
the
hops
and
yeast
are
interesting
bedfellows
the
abv
comes
up
big
but
hey
nothing
wrong
with
a
nicedrinking
buzz
this
is
my
first
captain
lawrence
beer
but
rest
assured
it
will
not
be
my
last
pours
a
pale
straw
gold
nice
haziness
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
that
very
slowly
recedes
leaving
some
nice
lacing
as
it
does
so
aroma
is
lemony
and
clean
citrusy
pineapple
a
sugary
sweetness
and
evidence
of
the
alcohol
strength
taste
is
large
hoppiness
strong
mango
flavor
more
soapy
and
perfumy
clean
a
good
alcohol
punch
with
a
spicy
pepperiness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
good
amount
of
soft
sugary
feeling
balanced
with
thye
pepperiness
on
the
tongue
from
the
hops
and
slightly
effervescent
carbonation
there
are
hints
of
belgian
sugars
and
yeast
but
this
beer
is
screaming
with
hops
my
first
cl
beer
and
it
is
unique
and
a
surprise
definitely
not
what
i
expected
when
i
saw
it
listed
as
a
tripel
id
like
to
age
this
beer
a
bit
to
let
the
bitter
edge
back
down
and
allow
the
fruitiness
to
come
forward
a
bit
thanks
alex
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
a
wonderful
version
of
a
belgian
tripel
that
pleases
the
tastebuds
and
puts
a
smile
on
your
face
noticeable
alcohol
knocks
the
score
down
a
notch
but
this
is
still
quite
easy
to
quaff
great
beer
worth
picking
up
excellent
scotty
beam
me
up
i
have
been
to
heaven
and
back
in
the
world
of
american
tripels
the
citrus
sweetness
and
bitterness
are
all
pretty
amazingly
perfect
reminds
of
something
similar
in
philosophy
to
the
houblon
chouffe
which
is
a
compliment
indeed
this
is
superbly
drinkable
and
i
like
it
as
much
as
if
not
better
than
the
original
though
the
original
was
really
good
in
my
eyes
i
have
not
reviewed
it
yet
was
supposed
to
but
oh
well
i
have
a
few

left

it

an

that

the

suggests

i
wouldnt
want
it
to
either
just
the
right
amount
of
apple
and
brandy
flavors
mixed
with
sweet
malts
and
a
minor
hop
presence
to
impress
upon
the

that
its

beer
its
easy
to
get
caught

this
because
its

doesnt

with

notes
and
some
light

notes
also
noticeable
body
is
full
with
good
carbonation
i
quite
enjoyed
that
one
with
loads
of
nice
drinkability
notes
and
the
brandy
notes
rounding
off
some
of
rough
edges
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
short
white

and
touch

that
belgian

character
sweet

apples
with
a
subtle
woody
oak
the
yeast
comes
through
on
the
palate
as
well
along
with
lots
of
alcohol
from
the
apple
brandy
it
is
a
bit
to
sweet
and
boozy
for
me
which
masks
some
of
the
other
characteristics
of
the
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
allagash
curieux
with
the
barrelaged
tripel
thing
going
on
but
with
a
completely
different
barrel
type
and
with
a
big
resulting
difference
it
comes
together
well
and
i
could
see
splitting
another
bottle
of
this
with
friends
triple
aged
in
apple
brandy
barrels
an
overwhelming
success
this
pours
like
a
triple

light
and
bright
with
a
fading
white
head
and
some
slowly
rising
bubbles
tons
of
green
apple
character
on
the
nose
from
the
brandy
very
fresh
and
autumnal
smells
hot
too
almost
like
a
spirit
more
than
a
beer
complex
but
subtle
grain
profile
some
oats
likely
in
here
giving
it
a
round
body
and
a
smoothness
thats
just
awesome
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
classically
belgian
yeast
at
all
but
i
go
get
very
intense
apple
flavors
from
the
brandy
not
too
too
sweet
just
right
a
long
fruity
finish
is
a
nice
way
to
cap
this
brew
off
very
well
done
overall
medium
body
but
the
residual
sugar
makes
it
drink
a
little
heavy
they
have
gotten
a
lot
of
influence
from
the
interesting
barrel
here
this
is
unique
and
delicious
a
style
that
doesnt
get
much
barrel
attention
but
this
proves
it
should
probably
command
some
more
hits
the
concept
but
does
that
matter
pours
hazy
cloudy
light
orange
with
a
foamy
and
somewhat
rocky
head
be
careful
of
the
overpour
because
it
will
give
you
too
much
head
nose
is
defined
by
the
essence
of
apples
as
if
you
opened
a
real
hard
cider
not
sweetness
just
appleness
flavor
up
front
is
very
offensive
from
the
alcohols
but
as
it
breathes
it
becomes
relatively
malty
with
slight
sweetness
alcohols
subside
into
a
better
balance
after
breathing
hard
to
taste
the
apples
to
be
honest
but
it
is
a
very
approachable
tripel
for
flavor
overall
enjoyable
and
i
would
have
again
which
is
not
what
i
could
say
for
many
other
tripels
one
of
the
more
innovative
barrelaged
beers
ive
had
a
real
winner
from
captain
lawrence
proud
to
have
their
barrel
program
in
my
state
m
light
body
warm
on
the
tongue
prickly
carbonation
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
purchase
it
again
second
review
from
bottle
poured
slightly
hazy
golden
in
golden
decent
aromas
some
barrel
and
apple
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
pretty
good
subtle
apple
and
more
boozy
heat
than
i
think
it
should
have
mouthfeel
is
good
but
warms
the
throat
overall
boozy
as
hell
not
bad
but
should
sipped
like
a
heavily
applefied
belgian
ale
interesting
and
quite
tasty
but
some
of
the
pieces
dont
work
all
that
well
not
sure
exactly
what
id
improve
but
somehow
its
just
lacking
a
special
something
o
very
interesting
ale
complex
yet
very
balanced
i
do
like
the
way
the
hops
and
yeast
played
off
each
other
the
bomber
cost
me
15
50
and
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
worth
a
try
but
i
was
expecting
a
delicious
tripel
now
im
wondering
how
fast
i
can
get
through
this
so
i
can
move
on
to
a
st
bernardus
tripel
o
interesting
a
bit
too
boozy
for
my
preferences
right
now
but
a
nice
sipper
bottle
appearance
slightly
cloudy
golden
amber
with
short
lasting
white
head
aroma
apple
juice
slight
sournessvinegar
taste
starts
a
bit
sweet
then
transitions
into
a
nice
light
apple
flavor
palate
light
body
sour
tinge
at
the
finish
overall
very
light
for
a
tripel
and
the
apple
brandy
comes
out
nicely
alcohol
is
hidden
except
for
a
slight
warming
sensation
o
a
delightful
take
on
the
tripel
lots
of
apple
and
orchard
bringing
tart
and
sweet
notes
to
the
mix
solidly
complementing
the
malts
hops
and
yeasts
from
the
tripel
definite
win
for
tripel
and
strong
pale
belgian
fans
sure
to
please
apple
brandy
big
in
this
with
some
good
barrel
influence
big
beer
the
brandy
barrel
usage
is
unique
and
fits
nicely
here
tasty
although
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
bit
more
golden
pour
clear
with
a
finger
i
head
smells
of
apples
wine
very
boozy
but
so
awesomely
fruity
i
cant
stop
smelling
it
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
most
mindblowing
beers
ive
ever
had
wood
apple
bourbon
bartender
corrected
me
its
brandy
so
boozy
yet
so
sweet
this
is
amazing
full
body
low
carb
def
a
sipper
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
its
in
its
own
completely
different
category
coming
from
someone
whoe
really
isnt
that
into
tripel
style
belgian
beers
o
a
phenomenal
beer
that
brings
together
flavors
of
tropical
hops
malt
sweetness
and
oak
in
an
pleasing
if
not
slightly
bold
manner
the
finish
is
just
a
bit
too
tannic
and
woody
but
this
is
still
very
impressive
taste
wise
glad
i
got
to
try
it
id
be
curious
if
they
used
barrels
that
housed
the
real
brandy
or
just
ordinary
applejack
either
way
it
made
a
memorable
tripel
i
was
really
planing
on
liking
this
beer
a
lot
before
i
opened
it
but
it
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
most
likely
an
older
bottle
it
would
probably
be
great
if
it
wasnt
for
all
the
oxidation
type
flavors
right
its
just
topping
out
as
good
to
ok
ill
have
to
seek
out
a
fresher
bottle
pours
golden
orange
with
a
small
off
eggshell
white
head
smells
like
a
belgian
triple
should
candi
sugar
with
bready
malts
tastes
like
apple
pie
absolutly
amazing
starts
off
as
a
classic
belgian
triple
bananna
clove
belgian
sugar
and
ends
with
a
very
nice
apple
brandy
finish
really
reminds
me
of
liquid
apple
pie
mouth
feel
has
the
high
carbonation
of
a
triple
and
a
light
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
finish
overall
amazing
beer
on
this
first
warm
night
in
front
of
a
fire
tgreat
fresh
fruity
taste
mixed
with
a
really
nice
malt
balance
bad
bottle
or
bad
beer
i
dont
know
but
id
like
to
try
it
again
to
be
sure
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
might
be
a
little
bit
on
the
outside
of
the
tripel
definition
barrelaged
belgian
strong
ale
maybe
but
i
am
enjoying
it
its
definitely
something
to
try
again
albeit
maybe
a
year
or
two
down
the
road
d
very
drinkable
the
apple
brandy
goes
really
nicely
with
the
big
tripel
base
overall
the
apple
flavours
go
great
with
the
style
but
the
alcohol
taste
wasnt
very
welcome
glad
to
try
it
this
unique
brew
is
a
cloudy
yellow
tan
color
with
a
fantastic
creamy
white
head
and
blanketing
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
wild
apple
clove
and
flaky
pie
crust
nuances
very
nice
and
intriguing
the
flavor
offers
a
definitive
sweet
clove
and
vegetable
hop
with
a
mild
corn
whisky
vibe
and
orange
caramel
theres
a
little
alcohol
but
it
blends
well
medium
light
bodied
with
a
smooth
but
spritzy
feel
with
balanced
carbonation
unusual
but
an
enjoyable
blend
of
apple
and
a
trippel
bravo
opened
over
the
sink
just
in
case
pours
a
deep
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
dissipates
almost
instantly
smells
of
apple
oak
tannins
vanilla
ethanol
sweet
fruit
and
light
sugars
the
flavor
is
a
little
hot
theres
lots
of
sweet
fruitiness
up
front
mixed
with
a
bit
of
sweet
brandy
then
a
solid
shot
of
alcohol
and
oak
then
we
get
some
non
descript
spices
and
an
earthy
flavor
yeasty
esters
and
sweet
light
sugary
malt
fight
against
a
lingering
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
hot
mouthfeel
this
is
kind
of
a
hodgepodge
of
flavors
and
its
a
bit
hot
even
after
a
few
years
that
being
said
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
m
medium
leading
to
full
this
type
is
just
not
my
type
of
beer
i
generally
love
anything
that
they
make
there
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
odthe
first
few
sips
i
enjoyed
the
last
few
i
really
did
not
like
very
much
too
bold
with
the
apple
brandy
flavor
and
quite
boozy
started
off
well
then
deteriorated
quickly
i
respect
the
effort
to
make
something
new
and
unusual
side
note
should
def
not
be
classified
as
a
triple
the
base
beer
is
an
american
triple
and
this
is
and
american
sour
aged
beer
new
category
should
be
made
lol
if
not
switched
cause
ppl
may
get
the
wrong
idea
and
not
want
to
try
this
beer
the
beer
is
indeed
golden
colord
with
a
thick
whit
head
the
aroma
offers
yeast
light
spice
malt
booze
brandy
emerges
more
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
prominent
apple
and
pears
throughout
a
bit
hot
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
oak
character
emerges
more
as
the
beer
warms
lingering
alcoholic
warmth
with
a
touch
of
spices
and
yeast
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
try
but
not
among
my
favorites
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
both
golden
and
delicious
there
is
a
half
inch
of
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
sticky
lacing
and
a
perpetual
thin
white
halo
the
nose
is
slightly
tart
and
boozy
reminiscent
of
apples
but
certainly
not
screaming
apple
pie
almost
no
yeast
detectable
in
the
beers
nose
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
big
hit
of
brandy
followed
by
a
dry
apple
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
buttery
and
tart
and
its
definitely
boozy
but
still
drinkable
guaranteed
to
burn
with
a
12abv
which
is
much
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
overall
this
beer
was
quite
taste
and
different
but
didnt
win
me
over
o
wow
this
beer
is
out
there
the
rich
butterscotch
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
just
plays
so
wonderfully
off
of
the
initial
tart
and
sweet
apple
flavors
the
spice
and
yeast
from
the
base
beer
just
adds
to
the
complexity
its
boozy
but
in
the
best
way
possible
major
props
to
captain
lawrence
for
making
such
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
crazy
delicious
mmedium
body
and
full
of
carbonation
great
beer
othis
is
one
nice
brew
would
love
to
have
more
the
apple
brandy
is
just
a
great
combo
with
this
style
o
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
but
i
thought
this
was
really
well
done
crisp
tripel
flavors
with
an
interesting
apple
brandy
complexity
sweet
but
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
again
pours
a
dense
hazy
golden
hue
with
a
tinge
of
apricot
translucent
head
is
very
effervescent
and
recedes
with
the
quickness
remaining
lacy
is
spotty
at
best
nose
has
a
nice
blast
of
apple
with
the
traditional
belgian
yeast
associated
with
the
style
while
im
not
a
fan
of
of
belgian
beers
even
a
little
this
one
is
palatable
as
the
barrel
characteristics
are
pretty
dominant
the
taste
has
a
nice
green
apple
kind
of
tartness
to
it
while
simultneously
having
a
caramel
type
of
sweetness
to
it
this
works
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
hot
but
i
like
it
this
has
a
genuine
beeralchohol
hybrid
feel
to
it
its
hard
to
tell
what
it
is
youre
drinking
at
times
and
i
guess
i
enjoy
that
theres
a
lingering
tartness
on
this
that
just
works
so
well
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
especially
since
i
hate
belgian
style
beers
very
pleasant
surprise
indeed
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
coating
on
the
tongue
i
know
this
beer
has
some
mixed
reviews
but
ive
always
liked
it
especially
the
somewhat
aggressiveness
of
the
apple
brandy
overall
really
nice
unique
brew
from
a
great
brewer
o
a
very
unique
and
memorable
beer
id
like
to
see
other
brews
receive
these
unique
barrel
treatments
my
earlier
self
is
just
the
kind
of
person
i
tend
to
deride
now
you
buy
a
barrel
aged
12
abv
beer
and
say
its
too
boozy
shoulda
stuck
to
the
shallow
end
of
the
pool
revisiting
early
ticks
and
reviews
is
extremely
illuminating
give
it
a
try
sometime
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
creamy
texture
and
a
very
prominent
barrel
character
some
dry
toasted
oak
along
with
vanilla
caramel
apple
and
brandy
although
there
is
a
lot
of
brandy
flavor
its
very
sweet
and
smooth
with
just
a
little
heat
only
subtle
warmth
in
the
finish
the
apply
brandy
is
complimented
by
light
fruit
notes
from
the
yeast
some
zesty
spice
and
faint
earthy
hops
for
balance
but
its
still
very
sweet
and
slightly
onedimensional
i
could
see
how
some
would
think
that
its
way
too
sweet
but
i
had
no
trouble
polishing
off
the
whole
750ml
o
really
like
what
the
barrel
aging
did
here
may
be
sweet
for
some
but
was
tasty
is
the
quantity
i
had
the
heat
was
also
non
existent
to
the
taste
which
was
more
pleasant
than
expected
very
enjoyable
beer
captain
lawrence
picked
a
might
fine
beer
to
put
into
those
apple
brandy
barrels
flavors
are
very
complimentary
while
the
beer
is
certainly
boozy
it
was
never
off
putting
this
is
one
i
will
seek
out
again
overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
captain
lawrence
has
been
delivering
quality
products
i
want
more
this
is
another
beer
that
should
warm
up
a
bit
before
you
can
really
drink
it
the
aroma
grows
on
me
a
bit
also
but
for
some
reason
i
like
the
flavor
much
more
than
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
it
started
off
pretty
sour
and
tart
but
that
quickly
faded
into
the
apple
and
grape
flavors
as
it
warmed
great
range
of
flavors
to
it
and
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
overall
the
apple
brandy
is
very
prevalent
particularly
as
this
one
warms
up
this
beer
was
very
good
cold
but
the
boozyness
killed
it
as
it
warmed
drinkability
is
high
if
you
drink
it
cold
overall
this
is
most
certainly
delicious
while
it
doesnt
have
the
spicy
yeast
authentic
belgian
triples
have
this
is
a
great
brew
light
and
refreshing
with
an
interesting
taste
that
will
keep
you
sipping
a
slightly
hazed
orange
infused
straw
color
with
a
bubbly
one
finger
cap
the
aroma
is
of
oranges
and
tangerines
with
tart
granny
smiths
oak
and
some
booze
the
flavor
profile
is
tart
off
the
bat
with
sticky
citrus
in
tow
oak
and
some
vanilla
toffee
like
flavors
come
through
before
a
dry
oak
laden
finish
a
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
booze
throughout
the
finish
is
mildly
puckering
but
largely
dry
overall
this
is
a
unique
take
on
a
triple
that
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
barrel
aging
added
some
nice
elements
to
an
already
well
crafted
triple
o
not
a
bad
idea
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
flavors
of
a
triple
this
is
a
bit
sweet
overall
for
my
liking
that
said
this
beer
is
richly
fruited
with
red
and
yellow
apples
and
carries
a
nice
amount
of
spice
all
these
things
work
quite
well
together
another
good
beer
from
the
captain
pours
an
opaque
golden
orange
with
serious
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
is
complex
made
up
of
vanilla
and
fruit
backed
by
bread
wood
and
malt
there
is
a
hint
of
booze
the
taste
is
sweet
like
a
fruit
basket
apples
with
some
other
indiscernible
fruit
flavors
with
notes
of
citrus
caramel
on
the
finish
moderate
body
and
carbonation
nothing
unusual
a
very
flavorful
and
delicious
beer
the
high
abv
lends
it
a
special
heat
that
may
appeal
to
some
more
than
others
the
cpj
o
the
nose
had
a
little
too
much
heat
for
my
liking
but
the
flavor
was
good
and
the
beer
was
enjoyable
all
around
o
very
tasty
the
apple
flavor
is
fantasti
very
different
for
a
tripel
but
a
nice
change
sneaky
alcohol
content
as
this
goes
down
very
easy
want
more
overall
a
unique
triple
as
stated
id
be
interested
to
see
how
some
age
would
do
to
this
beer
the
alcohol
warmthtastearoma
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
perhaps
some
time
would
subdue
this
and
let
a
bit
more
funk
develop
750
ml
bottle
into
wine
glass
this
was
a
gusher
as
soon
as
i
opened
it
didnt
lose
too
much
beer
pours
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
dense
1
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin

cap
decent
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
apple
cider
apple
skin
brandy
booziness
and
a
bit
of
spice
interesting
aromas
with
good
strength
taste
of
huge
slightly
tart
apples
apple
skin
honey
spiciness
and
a
bit
of
citrus
lingering
notes
of
spice
apple
and
citrus
sweetness
on
the
finish
no
bitterness
noticed
as
expected
for
a
tripel
medium
carbonation
and
fairly
full
bodied
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
with
only
a
slight
warming
on
the
finish
noticed
very
smooth
drinking
as
well
for
being
10
nice

of
flavors
without
having
too
much
sweetness
overall
and
excellent
tripel
a
little
to
boozy
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
tells
a
whole
different
story

a
very
interesting
take
on
the
tripel
style
which
is
known
for
its
fruity
characteristics
instead
of
the
typical
banana
its
a
ton
of
apples
through
and
through
quite
tasty
but
with
a
definite
kick
this
one
will
keep
you
sipping
mouthfeel
is
nicely
crisp
and
fairly
effervescent
like
any
other
tripel
leaves
a
dryness
in
the
mouth
too
picked
this
bottle
up
on
a
whim
due
to
the
apple
brandy
aging
glad
i
did
too
definitely
pick
it
up
purchased
at
the
2011
rosso
release
bottle
opened
with
a
pop
and
a
slow
gush
served
in
a
chalice
pours
a
goldenorange
with
a
semihazy
clarity
and
a
loose
quarter
inch
white
head
that
quickly
disperses
into
a
soapy
skim
some
lacing
but
weak
legs
fantastic
nose
on
this
beer
apple
brandy
citrus
and
a
sweet
character
taste
is
consistent
with
nose
but
really
quite
boozy
some
apple
pie
spice
is
definitely
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
pricklygassy
carbonation
theres
also
quite
a
bit
of
residual
alcohol
heat
at
the
finish
an
interesting
beer
but
i
think
i
needs
to
be
laid
down
for
a
quite
a
while
to
even
it
out
a
bit
if
you
are
opening
it
fresh
share
it
with
a
few
people
that
said
i
plan
on
picking
up
a
bottle
when
the
opportunity
presents
to
cellar
for
35
years
very
pleased
i
cellared
this
until
the
weather
got
hot
as
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
despite
being
more
of
a
sipper
while
it
isnt
quite
in
line
with
the
style
and
time
may
have
mellowed
the
hops
probably
dulling
the
impact
intended
by
the
brewer
this
is
an
excellent
creative
gentle
and
almost
sour
ale
well
worth
seeking
out
wow
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
holds
and
leaves
a
touch
of
lace
nose
is
bright
brilliant
golden
delicious
apple
up
front
followed
by
hops
a
spicy
belgianstyle
maltyeast
backbone
and
a
faint
vanillabrandywood
character
very
very
pretty
everything
comes
together
in
harmony
in
the
taste
as
flavors
play
off
of
each
other
extremely
well
my
palate
cant
tell
what
is
what
and
that
means
it
has
come
together
seamlessly
fruit
coming
from
the
barrel
the
hops
and
the
yeast
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
turn
the
spiciness
into
yumminess
beers
like
this
are
usually
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
turns
my
gears
like
crazy
awesome
medium
body
with
lower
carbonation
than
expected
and
the
booze
never
seems
to
get
hot
awesome
great
beer
from
one
of
the
uss
most
talented
breweries
thanks
captain
overall
im
really
glad
i
had
this
but
not
much
about
this
shouted
tripel
likely
due
to
the
dryhopping
and
the
apple
brandy
barrel
still
i
strongly
suggest
you
try
this
provided
you
have
the
opportunity
the
fresher
the
better
o
overall
while
its
not
a
bad
smelling
beer
its
not
something
i
would
spend
the
money
on
again
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
since
i
love
apple
brandy
and
tripels
but
this
one
just
doesnt
work
for
me
if
you
factor
in
the
price
i
dont
it
just
gets
worse
m
another
very
well
done
beer
by
cl
brewing
love
the
fact
that
this
stuff
is
local
and
i
can
swing
by
the
brewery
at
any
time
to
pick
up
a
bottle
or
sixtel
for
that
matter
o
a
beer
for
the
wife
would
enjoy
on
a
special
occasion
would
not
appreciate
this
beer
every
day
would
seek
it
out
for
the
wife
just
will
not
be
a
beer
for
me
really
clean
for
a
big
beer
true
to
its
name
it
is
golden
and
delicious
im
glad
cl
decided
to
make
this
a
year
round
beer
it
makes
it
easier
to
get
me
fingaz
on
it
overall
this
exceeded
my
expectations
because
ive
had
a
few
disaster
ba
triples
from
the
northeast
i
think
this
is
cool
and
not
overly
barreled
up
because
of
the
repeated
use
of
the
barrels
i
tried
this
brew
on
tap
at
the
good
life
the
beer
preented
a
somewhat
cloudy
pear
green
color
with
a
white
creamy
head
the
nose
was
floral
with
green
apple
and
hops
the
taste
was
tart
and
crisp
with
a
subtle
taste
of
ranny
smith
apples
not
too
sweet
and
very
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
yet
crisp
and
not
nearly
boozy
for
the
lofty
10
abv
listed
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
an
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
summer
or
pringtime
refreshing
brew
the
beer
worlds
version
of
the
apple
martini
enjoy
d
the
only
issue
is
what
you
almost
expect
from
the
get
go
its
a
hot
brew
really
a
sipper
nevertheless
i
will
grab
several
of
these
whenever
i
can
keep
it
coming
captain
capt
lawrence
do
you
feel
like
i
do
it
was
sweeter
than
i
expected
very
unusual
and
very
unique
overall
i
expected
to
like
this
more
than
i
did
there
was
just
a
bit
too
much
dominance
from
the
barrel
aging
relative
to
the
other
elements
in
the
flavor
profile
aroma
is
strong
and
mainly
of
sour
apple
it
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
hazy
honey
golden
with
a
thick
and
finebubbled
white
head
malty
and
fruity
flavor
has
a
firm
but
not
nasty
alcohol
nip
lively
fizzy
texture
leaves
behind
a
firm
persistent
tingle
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
that
initially
seemed
over
the
top
but
as
im
nearing
the
end
of
my
glass
im
wishing
for
a
bit
more
visually
the
carbonation
was
lasting
but
lacking
a
bit
in
the
feel
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
that
was
deep
complex
and
enjoyable
my
only
gripe
is
that
this
brew
was
a
bit
hot
i
wish
i
knew
a
bottle
date
so
i
could
try
this
again
bit
with
an
older
vintage
im
sure
the
bottle
i
had
would
have
been
a
pleasure
to
drink
with
another
year
or
so
on
it
the
body
is
a
little
light
plenty
of
carbonation
though
except
for
the
alcohol
burn
this
is
very
tasty
and
drinkable
not
a
pounder
but
it
goes
down
fast
for
what
it
is
d
the
drinkability
improves
as
the
beer
warms
up
although
im
still
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
its
definitely
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
sipped
did
not
enjoy
this
one
at
all
this
brew
is
a
boozy
hot
mess
hopefully
age
might
help
this
one
but
i
doubt
it
this
was
a
very
quaffable
beer
that
i
hope
to
see
again
soon

pours
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
that
retreats
oh
so
fast
not
to
return
aroma
is
a
blend
of
white
oak
barrel
apple
brandy
and
estery
fruity
belgian
yeast
alcohol
is
also
present
on
the
nose
the
oak
and
apple
flavors
are
up

here
with
some
fruity
notes
hidden
below
them
alot
of
brandy
flavor
comes
through
the
flavor
is
somewhat
tart
and
somewhat
dry
definatly
alcoholic
i
shared
a
16oz
growler
of
this
with
my
lady
and
can
honestly
say
that
was
enough
for
me
powerfully
flavored
its
good
but
in
moderation
appearance
is
a
cloudy
honey
tone
with
very
little
head
its
smell
has
apple
caramel
alcohol
and
some
oak
taking
a
sip
of
golden
delicious
some
of
those
same
flavors
are
still
there
along
with
some
brandy
and
in
the
end
a
tartness
mf
is
medium
bodied
light
on
the
carbonation
i
believe
this
clocks
in
at
10
abv
and
with
all
that
is
going
on
with
the
beer
is
a
sipper
gd
is
definitely
a
very
good
reincarnation
of
xtra
gold
with
some
new
characteristics
thanks
to
hopp
for
grabbing
this
for
me
at
bierkraft
last
fall
pours
a
bright
lemon
yellow
with
a
white
head
nose
is
sour
granny
smith
apples
and
a
hint
of
lemon
although
the
smell
is
tart
i
dont
detect
any
of
the
funk
other
reviewers
have
noticed
flavor
is
dominated
by
tart
apples
and
refreshing
lemon
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
brandy
before
so
cant
pick
out
that
flavor
this
is
a
fairly
sugary
beer
thick
coating
sticky
and
highly
carbonated
overall
quite
good
this
is
a
great
hot
weather
beer
for
those
like
me
who
prefer
to
avoid
drinking
anything
under
9
abv
not
sure
what
abv
this
is
but
id
be
surprised
if
its
less
than
9
5
however
this
should
be
sold
in
smaller
bottles
750ml
is
ridiculous
no
way
i
can
finish
a
bottle
of
this
in
one
night
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
rapidly
fading
white
head
smells
of
apple
yeast
a
touch
of
brandy
and
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
i
have
only
recently
started
to
dabble
with
sour
beers
and
this
nose
the
slightest
twinge
of
being
an
apple
sour
the
triple
is
an
interesting
canvas
for
the
rest
of
this
beer
to
paint
on
over
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
nose
yeasty
and
a
bit
dry
on
the
back
with
indications
of
apple
and
a
bit
of
booziness
i
have
never
said
this
before
but
a
bit
of
spice
might
have
gone
a
long
way
to
finish
this
beer
that
being
said
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
despite
leaving
me
wanting
something
this
beer
is
rather
carbonated
and
gave
a
minigush
when
opened
actually
is
pleasant
in
the
beer
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
whatever
the
beer
is
di
am
kind
of
torn
here
this
is
clearly
very
tasty
but
there
is
a
bit
too
much
fusel
alcohol
which
makes
it
weird
perhaps
a
bit
more
aging
on
the
bottle
would
tone
this
down
still
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
the
apple
does
not
dominate
but
adds
to
the
overall
package
well
bold
and
unique
one
or
two
glasses
would
be
enough
i
would
drink
this
again
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
filmy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
boozy
tart
apples
theres
some
spice
there
but
its
not
apple
pie
spices
more
like
black
pepper
also
very
champagney
flavor
is
boozy
tart
crabapples
not
sweet
or
spicy
enough
to
evoke
apple
pie
like
the
label
says
but
the
fruitiness
is
pretty
nice
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
in
there
as
well
pretty
solid
in
sampletasting
size
but
fusel
headache
central
if
youre
foolish
enough
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
had
a
large
snifter
at
the
ginger
man
in
nyc
certainly
an
interesting
beer
theres
a
slightly
funky
apple
aroma
the
from
barrels
i
presume
that
mild
tang
and
fruit
carries
over
into
the
flavor
with
dry
grains
and
belgian
spice
followed
by
a
kick
of
citrus
hops
the
ale
has
a
medium
body
with
a
little
sweetness
enough
to
enjoy
more
as
a
sipper
o
in
a
bottle
i
would
say
this
needs
time
to
cellar
probably
a
year
would
mellow
it
nicely
young
and
on
tap
the
booziness
overwhelms
the
balance
of
the
beer
it
is
a
nice
sipper
and
would
pair
fantastically
well
with
some
slow
cooked
pork
loin
but
for
me
it
was
too
hot
right
now
that
being
said
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
it
and
if
i
found
a
bottle
i
would
buy
it
to
cellar
overall
this
is
a
really
unique
beer
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
its
dangerously
drinkable
a
little
sweet
but
not
cloying
just
imagine
the
sweetness
of
a
tart
green
apple
and
that
is
a
good
indicator
by
far
my
favorite
offering
from
capt
lawrence
hands
down
d
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
a
nice
twist
on
the
standard
bourbon
barrel
thing
id
like
to
see
what
a
bit
of
lay
down
time
would
do
to
this

something
id
likely
have
again
after
i
finish
my
second
bottle
id
say
the
drinkability
is
somewhat
lacking
considering
the
booze
factor
and
just
that
its
not
screaming
at
me
to
take
another
drink
having
said
that
its
not
all
bad
perhaps
im
being
overly
critical

damn
it
i
had
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
finally
got
some
this
is
disappointing
i
have
an
09
as
well
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
that
aged
this
is
a
beer
that
probably
should
be
blended
extra
gold
with
portion
of
extra
gold
barrel
aged
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
im
hoping
the
other
bottle
ive
got
will
age
well
with
more
of
the
barrel
coming
forward
the
mouthfeel
is
defined
by
medium
body
and
some
good
carbonation
that
works
to
make
this
more
drinkable
than
it
should
be
for
such
a
big
tasting
beer
some
notable
booze
is
quick
to
flee
away
and
this
ends
up
finishing
with
lingering
sweetness
and
brandy
a
unique
and
rewarding
beer
from
the
good
captain
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
is
almost
medium
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
prickly
but
i
think
lightens
the
beer
up
the
alcohol
may
be
a
bit
hot
for
some
folks
however
i
think
its
perfect
and
adds
another
layer
this
beer
disappeared
from
my
glass
way
fast
d
man
i
need
some
help
here
this
is
a
very
interesting
idea
i
wanted
to
love
it
hell
i
loved
it
before
i
actually
had
a
bottle
but
it
needs
some
tweaking
good
on
ya
captain
and
tim
dl
easily
drinkable
very
good
d
the
strong
alcohol
taste
makes
you
think
twice
before
your
second
sip
but
fortunately
all
that
alcohol
taste
comes
with
alcohol
and
after
a
few
more
sips
the
beer
becomes
easier
to
drink
that
said
the
strong
flavors
linger
with
you
and
half
of
a
750ml
bottle
was
more
than
enough
for
my
liking
d
not
sure
how
much
alcohol
there
is
in
here
probably
dont
want
to
either
figuring
this
is
on
the
high
side
as
a
tripel
but
it
is
largely
hidden
pretty
well
alcohol
in
the
flavor
is
minor
and
there
isnt
much
heat
the
most
noticeable
alcohol
evidence
is
the
brandy
from
the
barrels
this
is
a
pretty
outstanding
barrel
aged
tripe
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
poured
into
a
tulip
appearance
is
a
slightly
hazed
golden
apricot
color
with
a
nice
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
quite
nice
with
a
good
bouquet
of
green
apple
and
some
slight
sweetness
a
bit
tart
taste
is
light
apple
with
a
bit
of
spice
good
medium
feel
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
another
nice
brew
from
the
folks
in
pleasantville
d
the
boozy
nature
of
the
beer
diminishes
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
id
really
like
to
try
it
a
year
from
now
to
see
how
a
more
balanced
beer
would
taste
like
nevertheless
its
a
terrific
example
of
the
beer
i
like
it
but
ill
like
it
better
with
some
time
on
it
d
a
sipper
for
sure
the
fglavors
are
good
for
a
triple
but
its
really
not
my
style
interesting
combo
for
the
style
with
the
apple
brandy
barrel
i
did
enjoy
it
but
im
ok
with
maybe
trying
this
again
in
a
few
months
or
so
thanks
again
chris
this
is
like
a
sour
tripel
that
kind
of
tastes
like
apples
the
beer
is
light
in
body
and
quite
effervescent
in
the
mouth
its
tart
at
the
corners
but
leads
off
with
lactic
acid
in
the
mouth
tastes
really
good
beer
finishes
pretty
cleanly
and
overall
its
a
nice
experience
thanks
tmd
interesting
in
an
interesting
way
the
apple
brandy
is
pretty
prominent
elements
of
a
tripel
are
also
there
which
gives
it
an
almost
sour
vibe
it
is
somewhat
boozy
but
the
tripel
flavors
kind
of
balance
it
out
it
is
one
of
if
not
the
most
unique
beer
ive
ever
tasted
sour
apple
brandy
with
a
vibrant
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
some
people
hate
it
but
the
apple
flavor
makes
it
almost
sangrialike
leaves
a
pretty
cooling
and
refreshing
fruity
feel
long
after
putting
the
glass
down
easy
to
drink
and
something
that
i
hope
i
come
across
again
since
i
was
so
impressed
with
the
uniqueness
and
in
a
good
way
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
yet
tight
frothy
white
head
that
settles
into
a
sparse
cap
with
some
sheets
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
tart
apples
and
a
bit
of
perfume
a
light
apple
cider
aroma
the
taste
is
of
a
pale
malt
a
beligan
yeast
strain
which
produces
a
juicy
fruit
flavor
and
some
bananaclove
there
is
a
bit
of
a
dirtyearthy
hop
bitterness
oh
and
then
there
are
the
apples
solid
apple
flavor
which
bring
some
of
the
sweet
and
tart
aspects
of
the
apple
the
apple
flavor
works
very
well
with
the
style
mixes
into
a
unique
flavor
profile
the
feel
is
on
the
light
side
of
moderate
with
active
carbonation
a
nice
mixture
of
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
ever
so
slight
touch
of
sour
drinks
quite
crisp
and
easy
seems
to
have
clean
flavors
i
would
like
to
see
some
more
traditional
belgian
flavors
to
this
beer
but
that
is
completely
nitpicking
very
solid
bottle
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
sweet
sour
apple
smelling
with
some
belgian
type
aromas
with
a
slight
touch
of
booze
very
interesting
tasting
in
a
good
way
sour
apple
tart
taste
that
is
very
reminiscent
of
sour
green
apple
jolly
ranchers
or
nowandlaters
you
know
i
really
kind
of
like
this
one
light
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable
edit
as
it
warms
a
bit
i
am
getting
a
green
apple
bite
to
it
granny
smith
apples
fo
sho
kind
of
disappointed
about
the
whole
experience
but
not
the
worst
beer
that
ive
ever
had
drinkability
is
extremely
high
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
like
nothing
ive
had
before
this
is
a
unique
beer
well
worth
trying
so
keep
your
eye
on
captain
lawrence
and
hope
that
theyll
do
more
batches
according
to
cl
this
is
an
attempt
at
apple
pie
using
alcohol
as
the
sweetener
and
apple
brandy
barrels
for
the
apple
character
with
the
spicy
breadiness
of
a
begian
triple
for
the
pie
crust
nice
concept
it
could
be
better
executed
but
im
not
sure
how
maybe
starting
with
a
less
boozy
beer
to
start
with
the
drinkability
is
high
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
great
brew
overall
apple
is
the
highlight
as
the
hops
have
become
very
earthy
with
some
age
dry
and
slightly
champagnelikei
think
this
is
a
brew
that
is
hard
to
not
like
not
quite
as
classic
or
complex
as
the
xtra
gold
but
another
great
brew
from
captain
lawrence
an
aggresive
pour
of
golden
delicious
results
in
a
beer
thats
a
nice
light
gold
in
color
the
white
head
despite
decent
retention
never
rises
past
a
finger
in
height
and
no
lacing
at
all
is
left
behind
the
nose
is
a
decent
mix
of
pale
malt
sweetness
with
an
added
emphasis
on
apples
spices
and
alcohol
some
of
those
flavors
get
a
little
bit
muddled
in
the
transition
to
taste
though
specifically
a
lot
of
the
spicy
yeast
flavors
get
lost
in
the
heavy
alcohol
presence
from
the
barrel
aging
this
murkyness
fades
somewhat
as
the
beer
warms
and
all
the
different
flavors
become
a
bit
more
distinct
the
beers
body
is
nice
for
they
style
but
carbonation
is
woefully
lacking
this
beers
definitely
a
sipper
and
the
alcohol
flavor
from
the
barrel
is
a
bit
overbearing
at
first
but
it
really
opens
up
nicely
later
on
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
golden
delicious
is
a
beer
with
a
great
idea
behind
it
but
like
xtra
gold
i
think
captain
lawrence
lost
sight
of
the
tripel
aspect
a
little
bit
and
focused
too
much
on
the
other
stuff
in
this
case
barrel
aging
with
xg
it
was
too
heavily
dry
hopped
still
definitely
one
worth
trying
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
light
on
the
palate
but
with
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
on
the
back
the
body
is
pretty
spot
on
and
adds
to
the
quality
of
the
beer
this
was
interesting
to
split
between
four
people
but
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
the
original
version
of
this
beer
xtra
gold
is
much
better
consumed
6132010
drinkability
a
pretty
interesting
and
fruity
twist
on
a
tripel
its
always
good
to
see
a
brewery
that
can
successfully
master
a
fruit
twist
on
a
beer
the
abv
combined
with
the
typical
triple
astringency
makes
it
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
but
it
is
delicious
and
probably
more
drinkable
than
the
average
tripel
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
though
one
i
wasnt
positively
thrilled
about
its
also
fairly
high
in
alcohol
the
xtra
gold
is
high
enough
as
it
is
note
not
from
experience
and
the
brandy
barrelaging
not
only
adds
booze
but
also
adds
plenty
of
heat
i
find
it
odd
how
i
react
to
this
beer
versus
say
allagashs
curieux
which
i
adore
the
heat
is
just
as
strong
in
that
beer
but
whereas
this
beers
heat
seems
to
react
cumulatively
with
the
base
beer
in
a
negative
way
appearing
one
dimensional
and
oftentimes
too
intense
the
curieux
seems
to
fill
out
all
the
gaps
evenly
with
noting
accentuating
anything
else
in
too
extreme
a
way
this
beer
is
still
well
made
solid
enjoyable
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
interested
in
such
things
but
ill
say
im
glad
i
instead
chose
to
go
to
the
southampton
release
out
on
long
island
this
day
instead
of
to
captain
lawrence
for
the
release
of
this
brew
looking
forward
to
that
double
ice
bock
one
day
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
very
much
liked
the
nose
on
this
and
thought
it
had
a
solid
flavor
profile
as
well
however
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
heft
in
the
mouth
and
a
little
less
alcohol
on
the
finish
definitely
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
though
high
drinkability
thats
very
refreshing
and
a
very
nice
beer
could
drink
these
all
night
and
all
summer
since
there
was
no
hint
of
alcohol
though
its
strong
still
quite
drinkable
considering
im
about
to
polish
off
this
bomber
solo
tonite
split
the
750ml
bottle
with
my
wife
on
our
anniversary
a
marginally
hazy
medium
gold
color
with
just
a
wisp
of
white
lace
and
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aromas
of
yeast
apple
skins
horse
blanket
and
lemon
zest
crisp
and
refreshing
with
nicely
balanced
flavors
juicy
apple
wood
belgian
spices
alcohol
heat
and
a
lingering
sweetness
a
very
nicely
done
tripel
pours
a
clouded
golden
with
hints
of
green
with
a
centimeter
of
white
head
fair
retention
and
lace
aroma
has
much
belgian
yeast
spiciness
fruity
esters
apple
and
some
buttery
heat
to
it
no
evidence
of
barrel
aging
in
the
nose
that
i
can
detect
mostly
a
very
spicy
tripel
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
spicy
belgian
yeast
cloves
peppery
bitterness
then
mild
apple
and
cookie
sweetness
on
the
finish
body
is
medium
maybe
on
the
lighter
side
due
to
the
vibrant
amount
of
fizzy
carbonation
this
is
an
okay
tripel
apparently
aged
in
apple
brandy
barrels
which
seems
to
have
no
or
a
negative
effect
on
the
flavor
profile
many
thanks
to
todd
for
grabbing
a
couple
bottles
of
this
during
his
weekend
venture
to
southhampton
on
easter
sunday
ya
have
to
open
something
special
right
it
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
murky
golden
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
white
heading
fruity
nose
of
apples
and
dry
champagne
but
in
a
very
subtle
way
taste
is
so
well
rounded
between
the
apple
hops
grains
and
brandy
it
is
astonishing
how
well
rounded
all
of
the
flavors
are
and
how
they
interact
in
perfect
harmony
mouthfeel
is
right
in
the
middle
and
quite
honestly
is
just
right
there
is
no
over
carbonation
or
excessive
use
of
hops
this
is
simply
put
together
responsibly
drinkability
is
second
to
none
as
the
alcohol
cannot
even
be
noticed
and
the
stuff
is
just
so
damned
tasty
i
do
not
say
these
sorts
of
things
very
often
but
this
is
most
definitely
the
best
tripel
i
have
ever
encountered
some
have
said
that
these
bottles
need
to
sit
for
a
while
to
let
the
alcohol
die
down
but
to
hell
with
that
this
beer
is
more
than
drinkable
now
originally
i
was
planning
on
trading
my
other
bottle
but
not
now
i
eagerly
await
what
some
time
in
the
cellar
aging
will
do
to
this
gem
of
a
brew
cheers
j
d
very
nice
though
the
alcohol
presence
felt
at
a
minimum
as
far
as
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
concerned
this
one
definitely
had
a
warming
affect
on
my
belly
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
thanks
joe
d
complex
yet
subtle
the
fruit
really
works
nicely
with
the
woody
characteristics
and
yeast
here
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
in
this
case
the
addition
of
apples
and
the
faint
brandy
barrel
character
really
enhanced
this
tripel
and
transformed
it
into
something
really
special
taste
is
tart
apples
without
a
whole
lot
of
belgian
yeast
influence
unfortunately
alcohol
plays
a
major
role
in
the
flavor
while
the
woody
tones
from
barrel
aging
are
pretty
mild
fairly
low
carbonation
for
the
style
accentuates
the
apple
nuances
and
brandy
aspect
juicy
amarillo
hops
are
a
nice
touch
this
is
my
first
captain
lawrence
beer
and
i
am
digging
it
quite
a
bit
a
unique
and
very
fun
beer
to
try
thanks
again
adam
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
slim
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
your
typical
tripel
aroma
lots
of
pale
malts
alcohol
warmth
some
sweetness
the
twist
here
is
the
apple
brandy
barrels
they
lend
a
very
nice
character
to
the
beer
its
a
mildly
aggressive
and
seems
to
tame
the
alcohol
warmth
quite
well
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
flavor
thats
a
bit
heavy
handed
in
alcohol
warmth
there
is
a
light
touch
of
hops
and
then
the
delicious
apple
brandy
flavor
i
cant
get
enough
of
these
barrel
aged
beers
it
definitely
makes
this
a
much
more
complex
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
another
quality
beer
from
captain
lawrence
its
a
solid
tripel
with
outstanding
barrel
character
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
fantastic
excellent
i
daresay
this
is
what
many
brewers
aspire
too
when
they
try
to
create
a
beer
that
hasnt
been
done
363
times
before
kudos
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
brew
on
an
autumn
or
winter
day
night
d
wiked
people
loved
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
was
able
to
get
a
few
bottles
of
it
although
the
barrel
aging
fruit
flavor
seems
to
dominate
it
does
not
diminish
in
any
way
i
do
question
the
carbonation
but
dont
feel
that
it
takes
away
from
it
at
all
if
it
was
more
like
white
oak
from
the
the
bruerygreat
balance
of
flowers
and
wood
this
beer
would
be
awesome
close
but
not
there
yet
it
was
nice
to
try
this
one
cl
always
makes
good
use
of
their
barrels
thanks
again
anthony
drinkability
is
so
so
the
mouthfeel
killed
this
beer
an
interesting
beer
not
very
drinkable
at
all
too
much
seasoning
mouthfeel
was
decnt
thought
it
wa
smuch
better
than
fresh
and
really
mellows
out
would
recommend
getting
a
bottle
of
two
and
laying
it
down
for
23
years
edit
emailed
cl
and
they
put
the
abv
around
11
it
is
fairly
easy
to
sip
except
for
a
slight
booziness
that
shines
through
on
the
finish
there
is
enough
acidity
to
balance
any
perceived
sweetness
but
the
heat
seems
to
be
a
little
misplaced
i
wonder
if
with
time
it
wont
come
together
more
and
any
heat
would
fade
smooth
good
carbonation
overall
easy
to
drink
really
and
the
alcohol
heat
has
mellowed
nicely
from
when
i
first
drank
this
brew
yummy
stuff
and
well
worth
cracking
if
you
have
one
lying
around
a
capped
750ml
bottle
batch
1
from
2007
poured
into
a
snifter
appears
a
hazed
golden
yellow
color
with
about
a
finger
of
fizzy
quickly
fading
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
a
good
dose
of
brandy
pretty
boozy
even
after
a
few
years
in
the
bottle
oak
pears
apple
skins
apple
brandy
sweet
malts
decent
body
with
ample
effervescent
carbonation
you
have
to
like
brandy
to
get
into
this
one
a
sipper
for
sure
taste
mirrors
this
but
is
surprisingly
hot
for
such
an
old
bottle
how
much
apple
brandy
was
left
in
the
barrels
when
they
were
filled
that
would
definitely
explain
the
hotness
and
the
lack
of
head
formation
definitely
hurts
the
drinkability
i
look
forward
to
another
future
batch
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
rapidly
great
clarity
the
nose
is
boozy
and
hot
with
apple
pie
spices
a
big
spicy
apple
brandy
character
and
some
alcohol
mild
honey
mild
fruit
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
almost
harsh
the
palate
opens
up
with
a
combo
of
boozy
heat
apple
brandy
and
some
hot
almost
solventy
alcohol
apples
honey
and
a
dry
spicy
finish
with
hot
alcohol
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
decent
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
d
as
much
as
i
enjoy
the
complexity
the
ale
is
a
bold
drink
that
is
tough
to
get
through
it
gushed
heavily
not
a
surprise
from
this
brewery
but
it
is
once
again
disappointing
when
the
yeast
gets
completely
agitated
upon
opening
and
you
lose
a
couple
ounces
nose
is
really
nice
and
enticing
showing
notes
of
caramel
fruit
vanilla
wood
flavor
is
juicy
well
balanced
between
the
sweetness
and
fruitiness
of
the
original
beer
and
the
apple
brandy
wood
really
nice
stuff
once
again
though
whats
with
the
gushing
drinkability
damn
good
beer
it
was
slightly
colder
than
cellar
temp
on
my
first
glass
and
i
think
i
liked
it
better
than
when
it
warmed
to
ambient
temp
it
was
a
quite
a
bit
fruitier
in
a
sense
than
it
was
warm
either
way
that
is
really
my
only
complaint
as
this
beer
is
really
good
and
im
feeling
good
big
thanks
to
geoff
for
his
generosity
i
just
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
this
one
plenty
of
sour
apple
in
the
taste
lots
of
fruity
spice
and
alcohol
coming
through
as
well
an
alcohol
infused
sour
apple
jolly
rancher
got
very
cloying
and
there
is
no
way
i
could
drink
an
entire
bottle
by
myself
overall
this
was
about
as
solid
of
a
big
beer
as
you
are
going
to
run
across
really
just
wonderfully
done
and
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
from
tasting

body
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
decent
drinkability
hard
to
get
a
fix
on
this
one
one
sip
i
love
it
the
next
its
ok
probably
wouldnt
buy
another
bottle
but
definitely
worth
trying
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
doesnt
stick
too
close
to
traditional
tripel
expectations
very
drinkable
d
excellent
and
unique
brew
a
very
different
tripel
that
is
interesting
and
enjoyable
i
could
easily
make
my
way
through
a
long
session
with
this
fine
beer
overall
i
probably
wont
drink
this
one
again
unless
i
end
up
getting
in
to
sours
in
the
future
d
ill
be
at
this
one
for
a
while
its
more
akin
to
drinking
liquor
that
beer
taddy
an
interesting
idea
from
captain
lawrence
but
falls
a
bit
short
of
expectations
one
i
was
anxiously
awaiting
the
release
of
golden
delicious
is
good
but
i
think
the
barrel
aging
was
overdone
i
have
another
bottle
im
going
to
give
a
year
or
two
maybe
thatll
help
mellow
things
out
bottle
sampled
courtesy
of
my
cousin
on
a
recent
trip
back
to
the
u
s
sampled
along
side
the
xtra
gold
as
well
this
beer
poured
a
deeper
golden
almost
brown
color
compared
to
the
xtra
gold
there
was
a
definite
apple
note
in
the
aroma
pleasing
the
taste
was
apple
alcohol
but
had
a
nice
hop
bitterness
the
taste
overall
i
felt
was
a
little
dominated
by
a
hot
alochol
taste
from
the
brandy
barrel
aging
maybe
this
beer
needs
a
little
time
to
sit
and
mellow
the
second
one
will
be
aged
two
or
more
years
because
this
first
one
was
very
disappointing
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
spicy
and
hot
for
this
beer
to
be
truly
great
in
fact
it
really
can
detract
from
the
experience
of
this
beer
some
age
might
help
some
but
it
will
be
a
race
between
oxidation
and
long
lingering
oak
notes
if
the
barrel
character
can
mellow
before
the
base
tripel
over
oxidizes
then
this
might
end
up
really
tasty
but
it
will
take
at
least
a
year
if
not
multiple
years
before
this
is
evident
i
really
like
the
idea
of
this
brew
and
hope
that
later
releases
of
this
brew
show
a
better
balance
between
tripel
and
barrel
character
drinkability
a
nice
beer
it
certainly
brings
new
life
to
the
tripel
style
bless
them
for
that
d
this
is
a
bit
tough
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
it
is
tasty
in
small
glasses
the
higher
alcohol
makes
it
a
slow
drinker
definitely
worth
the
effort
if
you
can
try
this
taste
starts
with
a
harsh
alcohol
slap
smooths
out
with
maltiness
and
vanilla
in
the
middle
then
goes
fruity
for
a
moment
before
giving
way
to
the
somewhat
more
sedate
this
time
alcohol
fleeting
gum
numbness
also
makes
an
appearance
in
the
afterglow
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
a
bit
tough
on
this
one
but
the
variety
of
flavors
working
together
and
the
potential
changes
over
the
bottles
volume
makes
me
want
to
come
back
again
and
again
heres
hoping
a
bit
of
age
mellows
this
one
some
but
still
a
very
interesting
idea
and
product
i
absolutely
loved
this
one
taking
a
sip
my
first
thought
is
a
tripel
mixed
with
apple
pucker
and
brandy
a
little
bit
better
than
i
make
it
sound
though
the
caramel
flavor
on
the
end
isnt
a
nice
finish
in
my
book
this
delivers
exactly
what
the
nose
announces
no
surprises
as
it
warms
the
apple
flavor
overtakes
the
more
mellow
quince
and
really
does
impersonate
a
golden
delicious
perfectly
way
too
boozy
though
not
in
the
sense
of
being
too
alcoholic
but
for
taking
on
the
qualities
of
its
aging
vessel
to
the
detriment
of
the
beers
own
flavors
heavily
carbonated
as
id
anticipate
from
the
style
but
its
locked
in
a
battle
with
the
syrupy
body
gets
even
tougher
to
drink
as
it
goes
i
appreciate
the
creative
effort
but
not
something
im
enjoying
a
great
deal
dvery
nice
but
quite
big
i
think
it
would
take
a
while
to
get
through
an
entire
bottle
solo
this
one
is
certainly
a
brandy
lovers
brew
i
found
the
combonation
to
be
wonderful
large
green
bottle
purchased
a
few
weeks
ago
when
it
first
came
out
the
brewery
pours
dark
cloudy
apricot
under
an
off
white
short
lasting
head
and
leaving
thick
and
splotchy
lacing
initially
this
one
was
aggressively
carbonated
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
after
the
bottle
was
allowed
to
sit
open
for
about
45
mins
the
carbonation
calmed
down
and
became
more
appealing
and
more
drinkable
the
nose
similarly
was
initially
sharp
and
somewhat
off
putting
but
with
time
calmed
down
and
became
more
rounded
out
in
short
this
one
imho
has
some
carbonation
issues
that
need
some
special
handling
and
perhaps
will
be
dealt
if
and
when
this
one
gets
brewed
and
aged
in
barrels
again
anyway
after
a
little
time
to
calm
down
and
cool
out
this
one
smells
of
alcohol
tastes
of
alcohol
apple
brandy
and
candied
apple
its
clearly
a
strong
sweet
and
currently
hot
beer
i
believe
scott
said
its
about
10
its
heady
complex
flavorful
and
currently
in
need
of
some
more
time
to
age
and
hopefully
relax
a
wee
bit
currently
it
is
a
warming
yet
tasty
and
interesting
sipper
ive
got
10
bottles
sitting
in
my
beer
closet
ill
give
em
at
least
a
few
more
months
in
the
bottle
likely
till
its
gets
summary
warm
in
my
house
and
then
continue
to
crack
em
open
enjoy
em
and
evaluate
how
this
local
at
least
to
me
offering
changes
and
hopefully
improves
over
time
pretty
aggresive
now
well
see
what
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
will
do
final
note
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
after
hearingreading
the
hype
about
it
pours
a
very
foggy
orange
that
carries
some
dull
brown
tints
creme
head
nose
at
first
was
like
those
little
antiseptic
wipes
that
you
use
to
clean
a
cit
kind
of
like
the
ones
you
get
loads
of
when
you
eat
wings
but
the
medical
kind
weird
eh
that
doesnt
take
long
to
die
thankfully
what
comes
next
and
stays
is
a
fairly
firm
wood
character
with
obvious
hints
of
apples
taste
is
nice
real
smooth
delivery
of
wood
and
apples
the
problem
is
that
the
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
here
feel
has
a
nice
biting
carbonation
and
a
good
liquid
feel
overall
the
problem
for
me
here
is
that
this
thing
is
too
hot
the
alcohol
burn
just
knocks
it
down
a
bit
too
much
though
much
less
after
well
over
an
hour
of
sitting
besides
that
flaw
i
think
it
is
fairly
nice
though
a
bottle
is
best
to
share
really
awesome
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
once
it
has
a
bit
of
time
on
it
mother
of
god
this
is
an
animal
who
does
not
care
about
feelings
it
has
become
so
smooth
and
wonderful
the
hotness
is
gone
all
you
get
it
apples
and
a
hint
of
brandy
no
wonder
this
won
a
gold
medal
at
the
gabf
also
a
touch
of
funk
for
those
who
are
down
while
i
understand
that
brandy
barrels
were
used
to
condition
the
ale
this
was
a
unique
one
and
not
something
i
would
drink
every
weekend
i
was
mildly
grateful
that
exposure
to
air
calmed
the
ale
down
after
1
hour
the
others
i
shared
this
with
thought
better
of
it
than
i
and
remarked
that
it
might
be
a
good
with
turkey
heros
on
super
bowl
sunday
wow
thick
gooey
caramel
front
and
middle
that
a
sour
apple
comes
and
covers
than
a
candied
apple
flavor
makes
its
way
in
and
mingles
with
its
brandy
brother
an
vanilla
barrel
goodness
so
thick
and
creamy
with
big
wood
and
brandy
on
the
finish
and
a
big
dose
of
throat
burning
alcohol
however
in
deters
in
no
way
from
this
masterpiece
this
will
only
tame
and
mellow
out
with
time
in
the
bottle
carbonation
is
a
little
stingy
right
now
but
again
that
should
change
with
time
cant
wait
to
crack
another
in
about
a
year
so
much
caramel
and
brandy
notes
man
this
is
delicous
an
enjoyable
drink
but
not
a
top
notch
tripel
serving
type
bottle
very
underrated
imo
this
one
has
some
rather
amazingcomplex
yeasty
grassybanana
esters
and
not
too
sweet
just
slight
touch
of
sweetness
etc
accompanying
tastefeel
associated
with
that
very
refreshingsurprising
xd
very
very
continuously
sessionable
xd
overall
this
is
not
a
special
beer
by
any
means
but
is
a
good
soft
introduction
for
the
tripel
style
i
would
probably
not
drink
this
again
because
i
know
much
better
beers
are
much
more
available
o
sprechers
abbey
triple
was
one
of
my
first
adventurous
craft
beer
endeavors
years
ago
and
made
my
top
five
list
when
i
was
featured
on
the
podcast
the
high
five
since
then
ive
had
it
now
and
again
revisiting
bottles
from
time
to
time
including
some
more
than
five
years
old
my
experiences
have
been
this
beer
does
not
age
gracefully
but
this
fresh
bottle
of
abbey
triple
wonderfully
showcases
belgian
yeast
and
the
juxtaposition
of
both
subtle
and
powerful
fruity
and
spicy
components
brought
about
wholly
by
fermentation
abbey
triple
is
a
lovely
beer
thats
also
dangerously
drinkable
o
decent
but
with
a
harsh
feel
this
beer
pours
out
darker
than
i
expect
for
a
tripel
and
has
almost
no
lasting
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
where
i
would
expect
a
tripel
except
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
which
i
does
not
belong
it
ends
up
making
the
beer
taste
sweet
and
i
believe
gives
it
a
viscous
mouthfeel
an
excellent
tripel
would
be
drier
than
this
which
registers
with
me
merely
as
an
interesting
belgian
style
ale
that
comes
up
lacking
in
the
deadly
deceitful
drinkability
that
a
tripel
should
have
o
this
beer
has
enough
going
on
to
compare
with
some
of
the
better
trippels
out
there
but
doesnt
pull
the
whole
package
altogether
like
st
bernardus
or
tripel
karmeleit
the
yeastforward
approach
is
nice
here
and
the
beer
is
very
attenuated
and
refreshing
the
acidity
of
the
flavor
could
be
toned
down
some
which
is
maybe
suggestive
of
hotter
fermenation
temps
this
has
a
nice
taste
and
not
a
bad
interpretation
for
a
germanstyle
brewery
my
dog
growing
ups
name
was
abbey
this
does
not
taste
like
dogs
this
is
clearly
beer
it
was
okay
beer
like
other
sprecher
ones
it
is
kind
of
a
pseudoeuropean
style
perhaps
it
is
okay
if
i
had
nothing
else
but
they
seem
to
not
be
on
the
forefront
or
cutting
edge
of
craft
brewing
beer
of
thr
month
club
beer
pours
goldenish
copper
with
fluffy
one
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
yeast
pear
banana
honey
dry
smelling
with
just
a
hint
of
funk
but
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
sweet
flavor
with
lots
of
pears
and
honey
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
light
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
not
half
bad
low
c
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
to
light
body
with
high
carbonation
overall
not
bad
but
a
little
middleoftheroad
for
me
overall
nice
tripel
alcohol
seems
half
of
what
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
tastes
like
a
belgian
the
orange
flavor
gives
it
a
great
all
around
mouthfeel
that
isnt
overwhelming
at
all
something
id
like
to
drink
again
no
doubt
this
was
part
of
this
months
beer
of
the
month
club
so
im
glad
ive
got
a
couple
more
bottles
after
this
one
because
this
was
pretty
good
the
belgians
wont
lose
any
sleep
over
this
but
its
pretty
good
for
an
american
rendition
overall
not
my
favorite
belgian
ale
taste
is
complex
but
i
find
the
aftertaste
to
be
mildly
unpleasant
funky
is
really
the
only
way
that
i
can
describe
it
not
bad
but
not
a
beer
i
would
look
for
again
not
a
great
example
but
not
a
bad
example
either
a
good
am
version
that
is
well
priced
and
acceptable
for
style
fruity
and
a
bit
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
nice
pearish
aromas
solid
mouthfeel
without
being
cloying
i
enjoyed
it
enough
to
buy
some
at
the
brewery
which
is
an
awesome
place
to
tour
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
sprecher
is
almost
more
european
than
the
europeans
o
overall
this
was
ok
not
sure
i
would
go
back
to
it
but
it
was
a
nice
offering
sampled
as
part
of
a
flight
at
sprechers
in
wisonsin
dells
pour
was
golden
without
much
head
or
lace
smell
lightly
of
bananas
malt
and
sweetness
tastes
has
bananas
fruit
as
well
as
a
layer
of
spice
cloves
finish
is
mildly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
firm
and
somewhat
creamy
overall
has
good
belgian
elements
but
is
uncomplex
in
a
way
that
actually
makes
it
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
kind
of
a
mediocre
tripel
it
doesnt
excel
in
any
particular
category
not
terrible
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
again
16
ounce
bottle
into
chalice
bottled
on
1282011
pours
hazy
deep
orange
amber
color
with
a
fairly
dense
1
finger
off
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
decent
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
streaming
up
aromas
of
apple
grape
banana
caramel
candi
sugar
clove
pepper
herbal
bread
honey
and
spicy
yeast
esters
pretty
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
strength
and
complexity
they
were
slightly
offensive
at
first
but
got
a
lot
better
as
it
warmed
up
taste
of
pear
apple
banana
caramel
candi
sugar
honey
herbal
clove
bread
and
light
spicy
yeast
lingering
notes
of
light
fruits
caramel
candi
sugar
honey
herbal
clove
and
light
yeast
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
pretty
good
complexity
and
balance
of
flavors
with
no
cloying
sweetness
at
all
surprisingly
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
slick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
tripel
with
a
pretty
unique
flavor
profile
it
could
use
some
more
carbonation
and
spiciness
to
balance
out
the
malty
fruitiness
but
overall
it
is
still
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
the
taste
overpowers
the
mouthfeel
but
i
suppose
that
its
on
par
and
average
m
theres
a
sort
of
faintly
greasy
oily
texture
going
on
in
here
that
i
really
dislike
other
than
that
mediumheavy
thickness
with
light
carbonation
overall
damn
this
beer
was
old
and
yeasty
but
held
true
to
its
base
of
a
pretty
nice
belgium
ale
would
like
to
try
it
again
and
probably
will
hopefully
fresh
this
time
good
especially
at
the
6
79
price
i
paid
for
4
bottles
will
be
buying
this
year
after
year
it
is
a
nice
belgian
when
you
do
not
want
to
be
knocked
over
with
power
and
flavor
it
wasnt
until
this
year
i
found
out
sprecher
makes
something
besides
root
beer
this
one
was
a
nice
treat
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
low
carbonation
it
smelled
of
orange
and
a
bit
of
yeast
the
taste
was
nice
orange
clove
citrus
blended
in
a
way
that
had
several
elements
and
presented
them
well
but
not
in
a
striking
manner
quite
smooth
and
just
a
hair
on
the
thin
side
it
hides
the
alcohol
until
the
very
end
of
the
glass
would
i
get
again
yup
overall
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
brew
wasnt
impress
with
the
moutfeel
all
the
fruit
and
floral
hops
with
the
alcohol
burn
just
didnt
cut
it
cheers
ive
had
this
on
brewery
tours
but
finally
picked
up
a
single
to
review
cardboard
in
the
smell
was
light
probably
shouldnt
be
there
on
a
4
month
old
tripel
though
taste
was
high
gravity
malt
liquor
grape
flavors
with
better
quality
malt
backbone
not
too
good
oa
very
nice
triple
smooth
and
well
balanced
blend
of
yeast
malt
and
hops
i
really
like
the
body
of
this
beer
nice
to
get
a
good
triple
at
this
price
comparable
to
most
good
triples
ive
had
and
would
drink
this
one
again
d
almost
too
drinkable
really
tasty
different
from
real
belgian
tripels
but
a
fun
drinking
experience
this
was
a
very
meh
beer
i
know
that
alcohol
is
supposed
to
be
present
but
not
dominant
like
in
this
one
got
way
way
sweet
and
cloying
in
the
end
little
to
no
head
smells
of
yeast
with
a
pronounced
banana
flavor
taste
deviates
little
from
the
smell
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
more
like
a
belgian
strong
ale
than
a
triple
it
feels
more
fragile
and
brittle
than
the
fluffy
head
and
body
i
would
have
expected
alcohol
comes
to
the
fore
upon
warming
a
little
overwhelming
overall
better
than
i
remember
it
being
im
wondering
if
when
they
switched
from
16
to
12
oz
bottles
if
they
didnt
tweek
the
recipe
a
bit
definitely
worth
a
spin
for
those
whose
palates
have
not
become
too
spoiled
by
the
top
shelf
stuff
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
slight
head
but
diminishes
quickly
leaving
only
a
little
lacing
scent
is
very
floral
and
fruity
im
pickiny
out
appricots
hibiscus
and
banana
all
of
which
is
very
inviting
taste
is
rather
interesting
with
a
lot
of
the
same
taste
as
the
scents
with
a
yeasty
taste
very
smooth
and
mellow
with
a
great
full
texture
leaves
a
little
bit
of
a
biiterdry
after
taste
probably
one
of
the
most
interesting
sprechers
products
ive
had
o
best
bang
for
the
buck
considering
the
higher
than
average
abv
would
be
my
beer
of
choice
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
i
didnt
get
a
whole
lot
of
malty
flavor
just
a
little
bit
with
a
nice
roasted
note
in
the
middle
i
keep
a
4
pack
of
growlers
around
all
the
time
now
love
it
o
i
dug
this
one
more
than
the
average
bear
even
this
was
my
first
sprecher
beer
and
it
didnt
disappoint
o
overall
a
good
tripel
and
very
reasonably
priced
i
could
use
more
fruit
aromas
and
flavors
and
a
lighter
body
still
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
o
over
sugar
ending
and
heavy
mouth
feel
really
misses
the
true
style
of
this
beer
do
nothing
sticks
out
tastewise
either
good
or
bad
to
be
blunt
sixteen
ounces
was
tough
to
finish
knowing
there
are
better
options
in
the
refrigerator
still
weirded
out
by
the
sprecher
twistoff
caps
o
a
good
beer
overall
but
timid
and
prosaic
compared
to
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
think
my
rating
compares
it
more
to
beer
in
general
than
to
this
tripel
versus
all
others
on
that
scale
it
would
be
rated
lower
nevertheless
enjoyable
dirt
cheap
and
always
available
perfect
for
the
2
days
until
payday
and
i
dont
want
to
drink
bmc
if
i
dont
have
to
type
of
situation
fuller
medium
body
milder
carbonation
sticky
and
syrupy
this
really
wasnt
my
style
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
overall
this
tripel
pours
out
as
a
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
that
fades
by
the
end
of
the
last
sip
the
aroma
is
quite
lively
here
its
got
a
lot
of
strong
white
grapes
on
the
nose
that
kind
of
remind
me
of
midas
touch
the
flavors
basically
mimicked
the
midas
touch
as
well
not
really
my
favorite
tasting
triple
out
there
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
which
didnt
really
help
this
brew
in
my
opinion
i
think
if
it
was
a
little
thicker
itd
be
much
better
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
id
like
to
try
it
aged
one
day
just
to
see
how
much
it
would
change
d
alright
beer
not
bad
for
a
tripel
makes
a
better
food
pairing
beer
without
to
much
strength
and
overpowering
aromas
could
be
ok
for
the
summer
value
amazing
the
snobs
will
score
this
one
low
but
read
their
other
reviews
and
take
heed
for
a
snob
is
always
a
snob
and
if
it
dont
cost
8
bucks
a
bottle
they
dont
like
it
overall
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
true
it
wasnt
exactly
a
triple
way
too
clean
sweet
americanish
pumpkinpie
but
it
was
quite
drinkable
although
i
was
happy
to
cut
myself
off
after
just
one
full
serving
a
super
local
extremely
fresh
product
with
a
nice
taste
high
abv
it
is
a
drinkable
beersprecher
rarely
makes
a
total
dud
theyre
pretty
solidand
its
a
great
deal
compared
to
expensive
belgian
tripelsyou
can
buy
a
whole
4
pk
of
16
oz
this
for
less
than
some
single
trappist
11
2
oz
great
value
although
i
probably
wont
purchase
often
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orange
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
compost
there
are
rotten
tangerines
lemons
and
flowers
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
again
the
finish
is
only
slightly
dry
unlike
true
belgian
abbey
ales
the
flavors
hide
the
alcohol
content
very
well
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
pours
golden
with
a
really
nice
white
head
and
a
good
dose
of
lacing
transparent
with
some
good
carbonation
and
a
thick
collar
the
nose
brings
pear
banana
spice
and
yeast
quite
delicate
the
taste
is
as
well
with
some
light
pepper
and
mild
fruits
really
smooth
with
great
carbonation
levels
quite
drinkable
i
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
the
dubbel
thanks
again
andy
d
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
relatively
enjoyable
beer
it
just
isnt
what
i
expected
from
a
9
tripel
an
easy
drinking
beer
just
a
little
uneventful
not
one
id
seek
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
d
there
are
better
tripels
out
there
but
this
is
still
a
nice
beer
spresher
has
done
an
excellent
job
of
masking
the
beers
strength
i
just
wish
that
there
was
more
complexity
at
work
overall
this
is
a
very
mixed
offering
but
im
still
glad
i
picked
it
up
once
again
this
isnt
bad
but
i
was
pretty
eager
to
finish
this
and
order
something
else
luckily
the
next
beer
made
up
for
this
another
offering
set
aside
for
me
by
vdubb86
and
enjoyed
in
his
basement
bar
didnt
rush
sing
of
basement
bars
good
times
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
orangeamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
banana
clove
orange
zest
and
black
pepper
the
taste
holds
the
above
as
well
as
ginger
coriander
and
a
pinch
o
nutmeg
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
solid
tripel
but
nothing
overtly
special
or
impressive
id
call
it
a
very
nice
goto
sessionable
relativelyspeaking
i
guess
tripel
definitely
a
sipping
beer
due
to
both
its
sweetness
and
high
abv
i
dont
know
its
not
too
bad
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
tiring
still
i
finished
this
alright
drinkable
for
what
it
is
the
appearance
was
spot
on
with
a
nice
light
golden
orange
color
with
an
extremely
thin
layer
of
white
foam
on
the
top
the
aroma
was
of
bananas
clove
and
a
smidge
of
orange
zest
the
taste
was
of
honey
and
ginger
with
hints
of
lemon
behind
them
the
higher
alcohol
level
was
a
bit
apparent
in
the
taste
by
causing
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
a
nice
crispness
that
was
accentuated
by
the
higher
levels
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
yet
it
still
remained
light
on
the
palate
overall
it
was
an
easygoing
tripel
style
beer
but
at
16oz
a
pop
definitely
a
one
per
night
deal
a
recommendation
from
me
its
one
of
the
better
brews
that
sprecher
puts
out
d
average
drinkability
abv
might
move
me
off
having
more
then
one
or
two
but
overall
not
bad
d
this
is
a
decent
attempt
at
a
tripel
but
its
almost
like
a
really
strong
weizen
beer
also
probably
because
of
the
bananayeast
character
which
is
not
uncommon
to
a
tripel
but
usually
not
the
biggest
player
hows
that
for
a
runon
sentence
for
a
more
traditional
tripel
it
could
be
a
little
dried
lighter
and
spicier
that
said
not
a
bad
beer
and
its
in
my
grocery
store
aisle
so
the
bar
is
being
raised
drinkability
very
smooth
tasty
and
refreshing
a
good
brew
from
a
great
brewery
it
is
a
fine
regular
offering
of
this
excellent
brewery
the
quality
of
the
beer
is
on
par
with
others
from
sprecher
and
matches
the
smokey
character
you
will
remember
from
most
of
the
beers
they
produce
still
it
is
unique
enough
to
have
a
regular
place
in
the
offerings
and
i
was
glad
to
have
bought
the
4
bottle
pack
which
my
wife
and
i
both
enjoyed
it
was
worth
the
price
i
thought
this
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
you
can
probably
get
better
tripels
for
cheaper
but
ill
enjoy
the
4
pack
for
the
price
this
and
kerberos
represent
a
solid
tripel
rotation
for
me
d
it
was
overall
just
alright
for
me
not
something
i
will
really
come
back
to
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
unfortunately
i
only
purchased
one
of
these
tripels
a
year
ago
i
wish
i
had
another
one
a
bit
more
boozy
than
i
look
for
in
a
true
triple
abv
shouldbe
hidden
a
bit
more
stealthy
looking
for
larger
head
and
more
lace
not
as
complex
as
some
triples
i
have
had
but
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
appears
a
clouded
golden
amber
heu
with
a
bright
white
head
fine
speckled
lacing
coats
the
glass
aroma
has
banana
clover
and
all
sorts
of
belgian
or
german
inspired
tones
flavor
has
a
very
thick
sweet
banana
and
clove
explosion
going
on
syrup
and
alcohol
notes
hit
the
palate
this
is
not
an
abbey
triple
this
is
underfermented
wisoconsin
triple
anyways
it
tastes
like
a
dessert
beer
nothing
wrong
with
that
just
dont
call
it
an
abbey
triple
carbonation
was
fine
just
the
body
was
filled
with
residual
sugars
alcohol
clearly
evident
just
not
the
beer
im
lookin
for
drinkability
overall
was
okay
not
a
beer
id
reach
for
within
the
style
but
theres
something
about
sprecher
brews
that
i
do
enjoy
even
though
theyre
not
up
to
style
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
cloudy
golden
orangeyellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
yeast
notes
and
spiced
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
slightly
bitter
yeasty
and
spiced
medium
body
drinkable
a
pretty
tasty
brew
d
overall
a
decent
beer
the
problem
is
that
the
price
of
a
4
pack
would
make
it
difficult
to
pick
this
over
other
belgians
or
belgianstyle
beers
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
from
sprecher
it
seemed
like
an
authentic
belgian
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
like
that
in
the
sprecher
gift
shop
it
has
the
same
price
point
as
the
other
beers
purchased
from
the
sprecher
gift
shop
in
glendale
wi
pours
an
orangish
golden
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
fruity
esters
of
apricot
and
apple
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
spicy
carbonation
good
fruity
flavors
slight
sourness
good
drinkability
d
very
i
cant
complain
when
a
four
pack
4
of
16
oz
bottles
costs
me
7
40
definitely
think
sprecher
could
do
a
bit
more
with
this
though
d
a
solid
to
great
triple
that
was
the
first
one
to
introduce
me
to
this
style
there
are
better
ones
out
there
but
for
the
price
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
simply
delicious
nice
job
at
a
belgian
triple
but
still
not
as
good
as
the
real
thing
d
some
people
may
be
inhibited
by
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
but
i
rather
enjoy
it
and
thus
makes
it
more
drinkable
the
abv
is
rather
high
but
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
back
with
ease
overall
not
a
bad
tripel
a
lot
of
flavors
a
decent
rep
of
the
style
but
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
d
i
think
i
could
drink
for
a
while
and
i
think
i
would
get
pretty
hammered
i
did
not
think
this
was
over
eight
percent
with
the
medium
body
and
almost
flat
carbonation
i
cant
stand
to
drink
too
much
of
this
strong
concoction
mouthfeel
is
sweet
candi
like
yeasty
and
semi
dry
the
high
level
of
sweetness
almost
bothers
me
and
im
usually
ok
with
sweet
so
its
not
bad
for
drinkability
and
the
alcohol
is
well
covered
while
not
a
bad
beer
i
dont
think
it
fits
the
style
in
enough
ways
dark
gold
to
light
amber
in
color
very
active
prickle
and
no
head
i
can
hear
the
sounds
of
the
carbonation
as
i
pour
it
into
the
glass
mildly
fruity
on
the
nose
fresh
and
light
attack
but
it
instantly
goes
into
a
heavy
and
malty
presentation
the
flavor
is
heavy
and
malty
and
the
mouthfeel
is
consistent
with
this
as
well
there
is
a
mild
sweetness
imparted
upon
the
beer
by
its
heavy
malt
concentration
the
finish
leaves
the
mouth
dry
with
a
mild
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
body
does
a
nice
job
of
hiding
the
8
4
abv
a
little
different
from
the
other
sprecher
offerings
that
i
have
tried
tastemouthfeel
smooth
and
has
a
malty
sweetness
with
a
light
bit
of
hoppy
citrus
for
some
reason
i
think
of
sweet
tarts
i
love
the
feel
of
the
beer
very
smooth
and
silky
on
the
tongue
with
a
delicate
sizzle
from
the
carbonation
the
alcohol
gives
is
a
spiciness
overall
this
is
a
reasonable
beer
for
a
local
tripel
the
flavor
could
have
been
packed
in
a
bit
more
and
the
balance
and
mouthfeel
oculd
have
been
better
it
is
a
decent
beer
although
not
something
i
will
readily
search
out
din
the
end
becomes
to
much
for
my
palate
as
the
sweetness
starts
to
overwhelm
as
it
warms
up
a
well
made
brew
for
sure
just
not
what
i
like
overall
not
a
balanced
beer
not
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
which
are
in
my
opinion
the
best
in
the
world
and
i
found
it
only
moderately
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
someone
only
try
a
single
of
this
first
to
see
if
they
like
it
and
then
move
onto
a
4pack
if
they
find
it
good
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
golden
color
with
a
clean
white
head
that
foams
with
an
aggressive
pour
there
is
nice
lacing
and
the
visible
carbonation
sparkles
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
smell
is
full
of
fruitiness
orange
lemon
some
hints
of
clove
and
a
mild
yeasts
the
taste
has
a
strong
wheat
flavor
a
strong
bouquet
of
fruit
a
little
more
than
my
liking
ok
balance
in
the
finish
could
have
one
or
two
of
these
but
that
is
about
all
this
is
a
great
tripel
and
well
worth
seeking
out
d
i
frequent
this
beer
very
often
and
it
just
keeps
me
comin
back
for
more
its
a
great
triple
and
i
think
anyone
can
say
that
if
they
like
a
triple
they
will
like
sprechers
triple
even
as
it
warms
its
tastes
and
aromas
just
jump
out
at
you
drinkability
i
dont
see
any
reason
why
this
couldnt
be
the
best
triple
ive
ever
had
it
is
complex
and
powerful
it
has
the
right
amount
of
earthy
spice
to
negate
any
chance
of
cloying
sweetness
which
usually
occurs
in
this
style
top
notch
note
the
bottle
label
has
completely
changed
mouthfeel
is
watery
despite
the
appearance
of
lots
of
carbonation
chill
hazed
deep
gold
with
a
wisp
of
whitish
foam
that
disappeared

goes
but
it
was
merely
a
very

perhaps
subpar
attempt
at
a
tripel
overall
this
is
a
very
disappointing
example
of
a
tripel
it
is
unfitting
of
the
style
it
seems
to
me
more
like
a
malt
liquor
with
dates
and
a
watered
down
taste
i
would
not
recommend
it
unless
you
enjoy
subpar
surprises
reviewed
from
notes
this
beer
has
a
fruity
wheat
beer
taste
then
there
are
no
hops
and
it
mellows
out
fast
in
your
mouth
it
tastes
like
no
other
and
if
your
into
lambeic
or
flemish
red
this
may
be
in
the
ballpark
for
you
my
wife
did
not
care
much
for
this
beer
due
to
its
oddball
sour
taste
but
hay
i
loved
it
and
would
get
it
again
it
makes
me
proud
that
this
beer
is
brewed
in
the
us
of
a
pours
a
golden
honey
amber
with
just
a
little
foam
after
the
pour
no
foam
whatsoever
after
a

ok
bubbling
toasted

with
some

and
a

ripe
apples
small
stawberries
maybe
even
some
red
currants
start
the
fruit
palate
off
but
its
all
too
dry
and
sudden
with
a
somewhat
alcoholic
finish
this
beer
lacks
balance
an
even
keel
would
round
ot
this
beer
much
better
ok
aromas
notsohot
appearance
and
a
mediocre

make
for

nice

very

much
better
then

maybe
they
should
start

this

before

i
will
not

alright
a

for
me
to

just
not

for

pretty
good

is
slightly
alcoholy

some
nice
dark

comes

the

seems
a
bit
watered

mouthfeel
is
good

and
a

carbonation
drinkability
is
average
opinion
well
it
is
beer
i
would
have
liked
to
have
tried
this
beer
when
there
was
still
some
life
left
in
it
this
example
is
getting
old
so
my
review
will
reflect
that
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
as
a
fresher
example
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
beer
out
because
i
can
tell
that
it
was
never
really
a
world
class
tripel
even
when
it
was
fresh
i
have
tasted
a
lot
of
old
tripels
and
this
one
is
lacking
in
quite
a
few
respects
even
though
it
is
old
try
it
if
it
is
convenient
and
if
not
stick
to
the
boys
in
belgium
drinkability
nice
not
the
best
or
most
interesting
tripel
but
a
good
stab
at
the
style
even
if
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
prevalent
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
d
decent
beer
worth
a
try
this
is
style
i
am
not
huge
fan
of
but
i
enjoyed
the
one
i
had
this
is
a
loser
not
even
remotely
close
to
a
good
tripel
and
pretty
bland
and
bad
overall
if
it
werent
for
merry
monks
i
would
say
this
is
the
worst
tripel
ive
ever
had
lucky
for
me
i
think
no
nevermind
not
lucky
at
all
ive
had
merry
monks
pass
d
a
very
nice
american
version
of
a
belgian
tripel
solid
brew
and
worth
a
try
d
decently
drinkable
overall
sprecher
offers
some
quality
beers
this
one
is
average
for
them
have
cellared
this
over
1
year
perhaps
too
long
for
this
one
seems
a
little
past
peak
will
have
to
come
back
to
this
one
again
in
the
future
this
abbey
triple
might
be
the
hefeweizen
ive
been
looking
for
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
a
little
too
quickly
the
smell
is
very
upfront
with
the
fruity
esthers
i
love
what
the
little
yeasties
did
there
and
is
there
some
spice
and
the
taste
is
much
the
same
fruit
malt
and
spice
followed
up
by
some
pretty
heavy
carbonation
a
tastey
beverage
thanks
a
lot
weswes
average
drinkability
the
8
4

would
put
my
limit
at
two
worth
trying
but
nothing
compared
to
the
best
of
the
tripels
while
this
is
a
really
good
beer
overall
it
is
certainly
nowhere
near
my
favorite
tripel
still
worth
a
try
as
it
was
enjoyable
goes
down

at

positive
is

no
expert
on
this
style
o
you
do
not
notice
the
alcohol
while
drinking
this
beer
my
perfect
look
to
a
fresh
poured
beer
out
of
a
tap
i
drank
it
out
of
a
13
5
belgian
snifter
this
allowed
the
trip
i
loved
this
beer
after
a
long
day
of
work
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
citrusy
but
not
overwhelming
in
either
area
this
was
an
easy
drinking
hop
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
beer
i
loved
the
alcohol
content
while
being
so
easy
to
drink
which
can
be
risky
business
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
belgian
trippel
im
a
fan
of
both
dark
horse
and
tripels
but
his
seems
a
rather
poor
effort
that
lacks
refinement
there
is
a
spicy
note
to
this
tripel
clove
and
banana
dominate
here
with
a
yeastiness
that
comes
right
through
has
a
dustiness
to
the
mouthfeel
good
but
muddled
in
a
sense
if
you
are
a
tripel
fan
you
may
really
enjoy
orange

me
going

a
thick
foggy
amber
with
a
ring
of
foam
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
almost
no
initial
appeal
to
this
in
fact
there
was
a
ton
of
sediment
that
i
didnt
care
for
at
all
looked

rocks
in

i
dove
in

the

was
to
come
i
was
pleased
slightly
warming
with
the
all
the
belgian
yeasty
goodness
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
nice
tripel
characters
but
just
feels
lacking
in
the
complex
sugars
that
makes
the
best
belgian
versions
sing
in
such
beautiful
harmony
surely
not
the
most
complex
yeast
ester
profile
and
the
malt
is
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
but
a
very
approachable
inexpensive
belgian
style
beer
a
minerally
character
emerges
that
is
offputting
and
the
bitterness
is
more
than
i
prefer
sapent

pours
a
nice
golden

with
a
good
sized
non

head
there
is

the
flavor
has
a
strong
banana
taste
and
is
very
creamy
there
is
a
good
feel

good
body
to
this

was

close

being

of
those
it
might
even
be
the
worst
example
of
the
style
ive
had
yet
the
best
i
can
say
about
this
is
that
i
can
power
through
it
without
dumping
it
even
better
dark
horse
makes
a
bunch
of
solid
beer
that
i
can
drink
instead
of
this
crap
overall
whilst
i
am
a
big
fan
of
tripels
this
was
a
very
poor
attempt
no
complexity
and
no
body
leaving
just
a
halfhearted
awkward
whack
of
belgianish
flavours
add
a
price
over
au150
for
a
case
and
this
one
doesnt
make
the
cut
ok
nothing
special
o
not
terrible
for
the
price
but
not
something
to
be
amazed
by
middle
of
the
line
beer
that
is
worth
trying
if
you
are
in
desperate
need
of
a
new
beer
but
not
something
to
continue
buying
stick
with
belgian
produced
beers
if
you
want
a
satisfying
belgian
style
trippel
overall
an
okay
american
tripel
mild
spices
and
yeast
fruity
body
just
okay
i
will
be
honest
in
that
i
am
a
bit
intimidated
with
how
folks
can
review
beers
like
they
do
i
will
say
i
am
definitely
in
for
some
big
time
beer
education
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
more
i
drink
it
which
is
interesting
because
at
first
i
truly
did
not
enjoy
it
particularly
because
it
was
way
to
hoppy
for
me
i
have
somewhat
forced
myself
to
drink
more
hoppy
beers
and
my
palate
is
being
refined
that
is
all
for
now
overall
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
but
this
isnt
a
great
tripel
p
s
is
there
a
way
to
dispense
with
the
cheesy
commentfree
smart
phone
reviews
im
just
so
busy
i
cannot
be
bothered
to
comment
well
then
dont
bother
overall
tripels
kind
of
have
to
work
hard
to
set
themselves
apart
and
this
one
is
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
i
really
like
the
honeyorange
angle
on
this
one
and
i
would
definitely
spring
for
it
again
o
strange
tripel
that
tastes
more
like
an
eisbock
or
hefeweizen
than
a
belgian
tripel
the
feel
is
nice
low
carbonation
and
smooth
but
not
particularly
full
the
9
5
abv
is
completely
hidden
as
i
was
a
touch
surprised
to
read
that
figure
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
spicy
belgian
tripel
ale
it
pours
a
particulated
orangish
color
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
scent
is
typical
of
most
tripels
so
is
the
taste
but
it
carries
a
nice
spice
and
clove
the
mouthfeel
is
fuller
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
one
for
those
that
enjoy
belgian
tripels
overall
a
decent
belgian
inspired
brew
not
up
there
with
the
best
belgian
tripels
but
ok
ha
s
some
nice
dried
fruit
notes
overall
i
rank
this
right
up
there
with
my
other
favorite
belgian
trippels
and
would
get
it
again
poured
into
a
goblet
color
was
a
medium
amber
with
next
to
no
head
a
few
small
streams
of
bubbles
rose
from
the
bottom
aroma
had
a
bit
of
alcohol
but
shifted
to
a
primarily
fruity
sweet
hints
of
prune
reminded
me
a
milder
barleywine
flavor
was
sweet
more
on
the
sugary
side
but
not
excessively
so
despite
the
sweetness
came
across
a
little
thin
and
watery
overall
it
was
pretty
good
but
not
great
o
overall
worthy
drinkability
dry
grains
and
fruit
touch
light
warming
of
alcohol
but
is
highly
manageable
wont
blow
your
socks
off
but
would
readily
reach
for
another
one
a
little
loose
could
use
some
tightening
up
i
e
sharper
crisper
flavor
and
carbonation
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
alcohol
should
blend
better
other
flavors
should
have
more
kick
from
reading
the
review
above
im
sure
it
sounds
like
i
hate
this
beer
i
dont
i
guess
i
was
being
hard
on
it
because
i
expected
much
more
its
definitely
good
in
the
sense
that
id
have
it
again
and
i
have
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
some
of
the
bigboy
tripels
out
there
it
lacks
the
robustness
finesse
and
complexity
that
the
style
commands
although
its
still
a
reasonably
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
in
a
more
broad
sense
pours
fairly
flat
for
a
belgian
trippel
and
has
an
pretty
hazy
orange
look
the
smell
hit
you
with
a
little
spice
which
is
mostly
cloves
but
nothing
that
seems
to
impressive
the
taste
is
pretty
lacking
too
it
hits
you
with
some
cloves
and
like
the
look
it
was
kind
of
flat
keeps
reminding
me
of
a
watered
down
version
of
weyerbacher
merry
monk
overall
nothing
great
going
on
here
i
probably
will
pass
on
this
in
the
beer
isle
o
just
great
ill
be
repurchasing
the
shit
out
of
this
this
is
a
pretty
decent
tripel
nice
fruity
esters
with
an
underlying
sweetness
that
works
its
a
bit
boozy
though
which
would
probably
be
a
big
detractor
for
me
but
it
isnt
like
a
lot
of
the
disastrous
tripels
you
see
american
breweries
putting
out
great
addition
to
the
mix
six
i
picked
out
im
sorry
to
say
that
this
is
quite
disappointing
first
the
appearance
is
frightening
its
murky
and
has
a
ton
of
stuff
floating
around
if
this
came
out
of
a
faucet
i
would
have
freaked
out
the
nose
is
almost
nonexistent
the
taste
is
intensely
bitter
which
takes
away
from
everything
else
the
booze
is
also
intense
the
finish
is
quite
dry
which
seems
to
leave
the
intense
bitterness
on
the
palate
the
esters
that
come
through
are
nice
but
that
doesnt
make
up
for
the
rest
of
it
i
wont
be
picking
this
up
again
ok
attempt
flawed
but
what
works
works
well
worth
a
try
overall
this
was
my
first
dark
horse
beer
i
know
they
are
rated
highly
but
i
would
say
that
if
you
want
a
triple
get
another
brand
nothing
special
here
overall
a
very
different
tripel
and
i
love
that
im
used
to
the
typical
banana
and
clove
flavors
to
the
point
where
ive
often
had
some
trouble
deciphering
between
a
dunkelweizen
and
a
tripel
so
this
is
a
welcome
change
the
bit
of
tartness
is
also
nice
a
wonderfully
fruity
tasty
beer
o
this
is
a
deliciously
malty
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
i
am
more
of
an
ipaimperial
stout
guy
but
this
beer
could
certainly
satiate
my
occasional
thirst
for
something
sweeter
and
maltier
o
overall
it
quite
good
smooth
mellow
has
good
texture
not
too
pricey
local
id
recommend
it
o
the
beer
definitely
tastes
strong
but
for
the
most
part
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
its
not
very
complex
but
is
a
pretty
good
american
representation
of
a
belgian
style
o
overall
at
9
5
this
beer
is
an
easy
drinking
killer
although
it
tastes
nothing
as
i
had
expected
not
a
great
craft
brew
honestly
but
id
have
it
again
overall
a
tasty
triple
a
touch
less
boozy
smell
and
taste
could
help
it
quite
a
bit
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
it
had
as
much
in
common
with
some
strong
ales
ive
had
as
it
did
a
tripel
fruity
orchard
flavors
but
also
savory
earthy
and
musky
had
a
chewy
consistency
whereas
i
think
of
tripels
being
a
little
more
soft
and
fuzzy
again
this
was
a
great
beer
i
suspect
it
may
be
better
than
the
reviews
its
getting
simply
because
it
is
a
little
off
as
a
tripel
o
overall
im
from
marhsall
home
of
the
dark
horse
and
this
is
one
of
my
my
favorite
regular
beers
it
is
no
westmalle
but
is
a
fantastic
american
version
of
a
tripel
and
a
dark
horse
staple
that
means
spring
has
arrived
and
scotty
must
leave
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
tripels
but
overall
i
think
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
a
fine
part
of
dark
horses
stable
for
big
fans
of
the
style
or
fans
of
this
brewery
only
there
are
far
better
tripels
out
there
if
youre
just
starting
to
explore
o
not
a
terrible
tripel
but
not
very
good
either
it
lacks
complexity
and
attenuation
and
is
a
bit
too
boozy
as
well
a
decent
sipper
overall
this
tripel
is
not
delivering
theres
no
body
no
malt
sweetness
no
candy
tasting
goodness
even
the
wonderful
bouquet
on
this
is
not
coming
out
in
the
palate
too
bad
because
it
smells
really
good
do
nothing
jumped
out
at
me
i
had
thoughts
of
drainpouring
but
i
finished
it
pass
on
this
one
there
are
better
tripels
out
there
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
just
sort
of
unpleasant
in
the
mouth
quite
bland
and
simple
the
abv
is
completely
hidden
under
the
wheat
malt
i
like
dark
horse
as
a
brewery
but
this
one
just
really
didnt
do
anything
for
me
compared
to
other
dark
horse
beers
as
well
as
tripels
came
from
a
tap
head
was
fine
and
lingered
nice
lacing
golden
color
slightly
cloudy
smells
of
apricots
malt
some
spice
tastes
of
biscuit
banana
not
a
bad
mouthfee
crisp
came
to
mind
overall
a
nice
beverage
not
really
what
i
have
learned
to
expect
from
a
triple
but
quite
drinkable
o
this
beer
is
an
adventure
it
is
novel
it
is
cool
a
beer
definetly
worth
experiencing
even
if
it
is
just
to
say
been
there
done
that
this
is
really
what
craft
brewing
is
about
diversity
the
boldness
to
put
something
different
out
there
something
that
is
really
one
of
a
kind
this
beer
may
not
please
everyone
but
it
is
definetly
worth
the
expereince
notes
certainly
not
that
sweet
as
most
tripels
but
its
still
drinkable
cheers
not
bad
but
not
a
great
tripple
drinkable
enough
and
i
will
enjoy
it
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
the
taste
in
particular
is
a
little
bland
overall
good
flavor
i
was
disappointed
at
first
but
its
grown
on
me
the
dry
yeasty
finish
helps
this
has
been
an
inconsistent
sixpack
though
flavors
and
haze
have
fluctuated
dwhat
a
nice
surprise
great
tasting
triple
with
a
lot
of
sweet
fruity
flavors
just
enough
clove
on
the
finish
to
add
some
complexity
definitely
worth
buying
only
thing
i
dont
care
for
is
the
slight
b
o
yeastiness
aroma
i
cannot
really
recommend
this
one
drinkability
not
the
best
tripel
not
even
the
best
out
of
michigan
ive
had
recently
but
a
solid
one
nonetheless
and
if
you
like
yours
on
the
fruitier
side
of
things
its
worth
a
try
then
again
a
lot
of
this
could
be
the
age
on
this
bottle
its
at
least
three
years
old
so
who
knows
worth
a
try
either
way
though
i
wouldnt
imagine
it
being
a
goto
for
me
if
i
had
the
opportunity
to
make
it
as
much
pours
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
hazy
light
amber
color
some
yeast
left
in
bottle
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
light
fruity
nose
and
flavor
is
fruit
and
caramel
higher
abv
is
hidden
2
49
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
overall
too
mild
flavorless
and
bland
for
me
this
is
way
to
easy
to
drink
and
lacks
flavor
not
very
good
maybe
good
as
a
starter
tripel
other
then
that
alot
better
out
there
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
golden
color
with
a
smallish
tightly
bubbled
white
head
that
displays
moderate
retention
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
candy
sugar
slightly
spicy
and
peppery
with
some
belgian
yeasty
esters
taste
starts
off
sweet
and
malty
with
some
sweet
candy
sugar
that
slowly
gives
way
to
some
peppery
spicy
notes
finish
is
a
long
lingering
spicy
earthy
belgian
yeast
kind
of
thing
medium
body
and
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
decent
triple
ale
but
not
my
favorite
this
really
needs
more
of
a
sweet
malt
backbone
to
stand
up
to
the
spicy
peppery
flavors
at
work
here
all
my
friends
and
i
are
obsessed
with
this
beer
come
summer
screw
oberon
this
tastes
better
and
is
a
lot
stronger
for
the
same
price
very
pleasant
balance
of
grainyness
slight
citral
and
clovelike
flavors
with
some
banana
as
well
hides
alcohol
very
well
a
staple
to
all
my
summers
like
it
yep
d
one
and
done
not
liking
this
at
all
love
the
black
ale
this
nope
just
too
messy
spicey
dry
no
malt
no
hops
no
real
fruit
notes
not
a
huge
tripel
fan
but
ive
had
better
i
like
the
style
but
this
one
seems
so
clean
and
flavorful
my
pick
for
best
tripel
this
year
rich
yet
well
balanced
pours
a
very
nice
bright
copperorange
color
with
some
nice
initial
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nice
deep
aroma
with
good
malt
sweetness
and
a
huge
hit
of
spice
decent
thick
malt
flavor
with
a
huge
sweetness
and
huge
spiciness
peppery
a
bit
although
its
almost
too
much
and
slightly
cloying
nice
thickness
but
a
bit
too
much
spiciness
that
causes
some
roughness
what
the
hells
going
on
on
this
label
anyway
the
contents
pour
a
clear
auburnbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
and
populated
by
streaks
of
floaties
kinda
reminds
me
of
liquid
sandstone
the
nose
comprises
clove
light
maple
syrup
lemon
zest
orange
zest
black
pepper
light
banana
and
a
touch
of
toasted
caramel
in
the
back
the
taste
holds
notes
of
heavy
clove
black
pepper
light
banana
toasted
caramel
honey
mandarin
orange
syrup
and
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
lightly
syrupy
feel
overall
an
interesting
and
solid
brew
as
a
true
tripel
i
think
it
misses
the
mark
a
bit
but
its
unique
take
on
the
style
is
still
pretty
easy
to
appreciate
not
bad
while
im
still
getting
my
bearings
regarding
tripel
style
beers
it
is
my
distinct
impression
that
they
would
not
typically
be
as
sharp
as
this
one
is
still
i
found
it
to
be
a
pleasant
brew
overall
and
am
glad
to
given
this
dark
horse
offering
a
try
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
yeast
some
alcohol
not
overly
flavorful
taste
is
the
same
yeast
fruits
alcohol
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
pours
a
dark
yellow
color
w
decent
one
finger
off
white
head
average
carbonation
and
lacing
on
this
beer
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
style
nose
is
yeast
fruit
some
hops
and
a
little
clove
its
ok
but
everything
seems
a
little
off
balance
to
me
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
profile
its
just
not
quite
right
feel
is
decent
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
its
definitely
a
substandard
tripel
i
would
drink
this
again
but
only
if
there
werent
any
better
offerings
o
its
average
to
below
average
wont
try
it
again
it
tastes
good
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
id
rather
have
a
rochefort
10
or
la
trappe
quad
anytime
ive
liked
all
the
darkhorse
brews
ive
sampled
but
this
one
i
do
not
like
it
sam
i
am
next
time
im
in
ill
ask
for
a
sample
of
sapient
make
sure
i
got
the
right
stuff
a
very
mediocre
tripel
overall
a
little
washed
out
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
i
just
wish
the
alcohol
content
was
covered
bettered
o
not
bad
at
all
i
wasnt
expecting
a
stellar
tripel
for
a
whole
10
for
a
6pk
theyve
kept
it
simple
and
smooth
very
drinkable
sometimes
you
dont
want
a
beer
with
20
different
characteristics
i
like
it
i
love
dark
horses
beers
so
glad
i
tried
it
its
not
their
best
offering
but
not
bad
poured
a
hazy
orange
with
a
quick
receding

was
sweet
with
a

to
it

use
a

work

o
got
for
only
2
25
due
to
the
stock
crash
at

exchange
not

well

overall
a
good
beer

my

for
a
tripel
as
i
like
mine
to
be
a
little
more
crisp
drinkability
is
high
as
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
overall
not
the
best
example
of
this
particular
style
but
it
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
drinking
triple
that
i
dont
expect
to
remember
although
there
was
nothing
close
to
unpleasant
about
it
either
v
at
10
99
its
a
decent
price
for
a
tripel
but
the
quality
just
isnt
there
tastebelgian
yeast
earthy

orange
rind
very
smooth
for
the
strength
with
a
refreshing
saisonlike
quality
tasty
and
very
drinkable
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
this
tastes
more
like
a
strong
belgian
style
wit
beer
it
seems
too
lightwatered
down
for
a
tripel
the
flavor
is
decent
and
nice
for
a
warm
weather
beer
but
for
the
style
not
great
the
flavors
are
too
earthen
and
muddy
to
accurately
represent
the
style
not
quite
my
taste
but
pleasant
qualities
e
g
aroma
mouthfeel
and
appearance
mf
very
crisp
very
smooth
with
a
nice
warming
effect
the
finish
d
good
tasting
brew
not
overly
strong
in
general
except
some
sweetness
up
front
more
bready
and
wheat
then
expected
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
but
glad
i
tried
this
one
i
recommend
it
good
thing
i
just
have
the
one
or
this
could
get
dangerous
quick
o
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
that
hides
its
8
5
abv
very
well
and
if
most
tripels
taste
this
good
than
this
could
easily
become
one
of
my
favorite
styles
if
anyone
has
any
suggestions
on
what
other
tripels
to
try
than
let
me
know
overall
good
i
wish
it
was
warmer
out
it
seems
like
it
would
be
more
appreciated
the
alcohol
is
hid
rather
well

overall
a

and
another
very
good
beer
from
dark
horse
something
i
would
love
to
have
again
overall
i
did
have
a
good
portion
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
so
i
give
some
leeway
to
dark
horse
that
this
bottle
might
be
old
but
i
did
like
how
hop
forward
this
was
and
how
well
the
abv
was
concealed
might
consider
buying
it
again
fresh
to
try
or
maybe
pick
up
another
single
from
ds
for
me
this
is

drinkable

herbal
in
the
nose
malty
smooth
in
the
mouth
european
hops
background
maybe
more
intresting
with
sa
little
bit
of
yeast
sleeping
in
the
bottle
nice
belgian
tribute
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
with
an
8
5
alcohol
level
but
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
or
dominant
here
its
a
bit
pricey
but
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
dark
horse
makes
some
interesting
and
fine
beers
this
one
is
good
simple
and
could
creep
up
on
ya
murky
dark
orange
with
a
slight
lumpy
head
barley
orange
peel
and
burnt
sugar
in
the
nose
not
much
in
the
way
of
belgian
spiciness
in
the
aroma
tangy
malt
flavors
citrus
and
a
cookielike
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
a
tasty
beer
but
not
the
best
from
dark
horse
and
not
really
true
to
the
style
theyll
find
their
groove
with
this
one
its
a
strong
belgian
contender
and
better
than
many
us
belgoans
but
is
just
not
quite
there
yet
not
the
best
tripel
around
still
a
bit
too
sweet
but
quite
good
would
buy
again
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
style
a
good
example
not
as
epic
as
i
hoped
d
while
the
nose
is
sweet
and
zesty
tropical
fruit
exotic
spice
the
taste
is
dry
earthy
and
uninspired
possible
overfermentation
or
overhopping
plus
too
much
sediment
reminds
me
a
little
of
bit
o
honey
candy
seems
exciting
and
sweet
at
first
but
ends
up
flat
and
almost
flavorless
halfway
through
perhaps
this
brewery
should
stick
to
american
ales
d
goes
down
better
than
most
belgians
ive
tried
welldone
ale
this
is
one
of
the
only
tripels
ive
liked
ever
di
remember
liking
this
one
a
bit
more
in
previous
visits
certainly
a
very
solid
tripel
but
not
a
standout
i
recommend
the
brew
for
people
who
enjoy
the
style
and
dark
horse
is
great
brewery
this
is
another
winner
for
dark
horse
the
sapient
triple
ale
has
most
of
the
attributes
of
its
belgian
forebearers
but
doesnt
have
to
cross
national
borders
and
comes
at
a
much
more
reasonable
price
despite
its
high
alcohol
content
this
triple
is
very
drinkable
ones
good
two
is
better
bye
i
was
excited
to
get
this
beer
home
i
love
the
beers
dark
horse
producesbut
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
from
their
but
it
is
my
top
three
the
beer
pours
as
a
trip
ale
would
with
foam
not
hanging
around
long
the
flavor
is
nice
this
beer
would
be
refreshing
on
a
spring
day
thanks
dark
hourse
overall
impression
not
exactly
memorable
but
worth
a
shot
a
good
looking
tripel
with
a
golden
brown
color
that
is
slightly
hazy
the
nose
reminds
me
of
pears
golden
dirt
and
macha
root
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
more
fruit
nuances
and
bready
yeast
characteristics
added
into
the
heavy
macha
and
earthy
flavors
a
good
smooth
clean
mouthfeel
slightly
chewy
and
a
good
medium
low
carbonation
level
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
brings
some
flavors
out
i
just
dont
want
in
a
beer
macha
is
not
a
flavor
i
would
ever
seek
out
in
a
beer
and
dirt
flavors
are
best
suited
to
adventures
in
funk
not
something
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
overall
not
an
overly
impressive
triple
and
probably
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
taste
is
delightfully
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
under
a
nice
amount
of
yeasty
fruit
and
liquid
bread
flavors
grainy
malts
and
some
darker
fruits
show
up
a
bit
as
it
warms
which
is
surprising
almost
raisiny
mouthfeel
is
decently
full
but
the
carbonation
is
low
which
is
odd
for
a
tripel
all
in
all
this
is
a
unique
tripel
and
is
pretty
good
but
lacks
in
a
few
areas
that
is
pretty
crucial
for
the
style
easy
to
finish
but
not
necessarily
craving
another
one
poured
into
a
tulip
color
is
a
bright
honey
gold
with
a
mild
white
head
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
retention
or
lacing
nose
is
strange
with
some
cardboard
and
phenols
plus
a
great
deal
of
slice
taste
falls
under
the
same
rubric
body
is
off
with
fairly
low
carbonation
while
the
off
flavors
werent
terribly
apparent
when
combined
with
a
lack
of
true
character
this
just
wasnt
my
favorite
brew
especially
coming
from
a
brewery
whose
beers
i
normally
enjoy
very
much
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
fruit
hints
and
an
underlying
of
candy
sugar
in
the
taste
dry
fruit
hints
and
a
dry
bubblegum
like
taste
a
smooth
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
bubblegum
aftertaste
i
kind
of
feel
like
i
ate
a
piece
of
bazooka
joe
not
bad
but
bubblegum
like
d
not
great
drinkability
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
again
the
metallic
tinge
was
off
putting
nice
triple
ale
hazy
orange
appearance
complex
yeasty
flavor
expected
from
a
triple
the
beer
was
deceptively
smooth
for
8
5
and
it
wasnt
until
a
few
of
these
were
consumed
that
this
became
apparent
overall
it
was
very
good
would
definitely
have
again
lightmedium
bodied
not
what
i
originally
asked
for
but
i
had
no
problem
finishing
it
12

clouded
orange
hued

a

skimpy
light
tan

that
leaves

then
a
booze
hot
first
sip
yikes
this
one
is
a
mess
on
the
unpleasant
side
unfortunately
it
lacks
the
characteristics
of
a
well
crafted
tripel
pass
this
one
by
so
many
other
more
enjoyable
belgians
out
there
sweet
and
yeasty
flavor
lots
of
up
front
alcohol
the
yeast
is
subtler
on
the
tongue
my
first
thought
was
barley
wine
at
a
far
higher
abv
the
carbonation
is
quite
hightoo
much
for
the
body
overall
its
probably
easier
to
grab
a
true
belgian
tripel
even
though
this
is
a
decent
american
version
i
really
like
dark
horse
brewing
company
they
make
great
beer
unfortunately
sapient
trip
ale
is
one
of
their
weaker
releases
perhaps
belgian
beer
isnt
their
thing
frankly
it
needs
much
more
of
a
belgian
yeast
presence
to
succeed
it
just
doesnt
have
it
its
not
terrible
if
you
see
a
single
bottle
its
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
pick
up
a
six
pack
an
interesting
american
tripel
but
a
little
odd
not
as
overly
sweet
and
simple
as
victorys
its
flavors
are
perhaps
strangely
balanced
man
i
love
tripels
and
this
one
in
particular
i
tried
it
back
in
june
but
never
got
around
to
reviewing
it
and
then
couldnt
find
it
up
until
now
the
mouthfeel
really
does
it
for
me
with
this
one
i
rarely
find
a
beer
that
i
would
rate
a
5
in
anything
but
this
beer
gets
a
5
for
that
absolute
flavor
explosion
followed
by
a
smooth
clean
rinse
d
not
drinkable
might
not
be
able
to
reasonably
drink
more
than
1
of
these
and
i
dont
think
id
want
to
thick
overly
sugary
and
a
maze
of
flavors
which
all
taste
musty
and
not
very
fresh
mouthfeel
is
ok
theres
decent
body
making
this
medium
and
the
carb
is
refreshing
and
zippy
this
one
goes
in
the
pile
with
all
the
other
somethingstyle
somethings
that
really
mean
a
poor
substitute
for
just
underwhelming
this
ones
pretty
good
though
id
prefer
more
balance
heavier
malts
presence
and
a
more
effectively
masked
alcohol
presence
that
said
i
wont
shy
way
from
having
this
again
the
appearance
is
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
becomes
a
faint
ring
the
smell
consists
of
various
spices
yeast
and
clove
seems
to
specifically
stand
out
taking
a
sip
the
sapient
from
dark
horse
tastes
vaguely
appropriate
for
the
style
the
overall
taste
seems
too
metallic
with
a
drier
aftertaste
than
i
would
expect
good
idea
to
have
water
nearby
drinkability
is
average
proper
abv
for
the
style
but
not
as
enjoyable
as
others
produced
in
belgium
and
the
u
s
still
a
good
beer
all
in
all
overall
this
is
another
great
brew
by
dark
horse
and
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
i
really
dont
have
too
much
experience
with
tripels
but
this
beer
may
have
sparked
an
interest
to
explore
this
style
a
little
more
keep
up
the
good
work
dark
horse
the
nose
is
pleasant
as
is
the
taste
up
front
but
i
just
find
the
lingering
flavor
to
be
less
than
desirable
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
f
lots
of
that
weird
off
flavor
with
boozy
malty
wheat
and
bad
bitter
flavor
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
was
it
also
has
a
creamy
flavor
that
bad
flavor
that
is
the
bitter
root
earthy
flavor
just
doesnt
go
away
perhaps
its
a
form
of
diacetyl
with
some
almost
butter
popcorn
flavor
in
that
weird
creamy
bitterness
not
a
great
finish
some
boozy
tingly
warming
alcohol
on
the
finish
as
well
d
drinkability
is
good
for
what
it
is
its
a
tripel
so
its
heavy
and
strong
but
itd
be
hard
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
quick
succession
not
bad
fairly
drinkable
drinkability
it
may
go
down
smoothly
but
i
couldnt
incorporate
this
beer
into
a
feasible
diet
it
is
not
for
the
meek
or
casual
beer
drinker
but
one
who
desires
strong
and
unique
flavors
and
does
not
mind
syrupyness
d
a
slow
drinker
with
lots
of
complexities
to
savor
good
beer
and
something
i
would
drink
again
m
very
dry
thick
side
of
medium
body
this
was
my
first
beer
from
dark
horse
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
this
beer
started
a
little
slow
for
me
but
by
the
time
i
finished
i
was
in
love
great
american
tripel
recommended
very
pleasant
highly
recommended
for
those
wishing
to
visit
brussels
or
ghent
without
leaving
the
comfort
of
their
living
room
chair
drinkability
pretty
solid
overall
ive
had
better
versions
of
tripels
la
fin
du
monde
comes
to
mind
but
it
does
the
trick
dark
horse
is
kind
of
a
hit
or
miss
brewery
with
me
but
this
would
be
on
the
hit
list
and
i
would
mind
getting
some
more
of
this
later
on
and
try
it
from
the
bottle
d
just
too
much
clove
for
me
to
be
something
i
would
buy
again
if
you
like
cloves
and
bananas
then
you
will
definitely
like
this
i
love
this
beer
it
is
the
first
craft
brew
that
i
fell
head
over
heels
for
it
starts
a
little
bitter
then
turns
sweet
with
a
finish
that
is
a
nice
spice
like
nutmeg
or
allspice
the
fact
that
i
live
20
miles
from
the
brewery
makes
life
awsome
they
have
inspired
me
to
get
serious
about
my
own
beer
making
the
one
draw
back
is
that
this
beer
must
be
enjoyed
draft
rather
than
in
the
bottle
d
not
a
bad
beer
split
a
sixer
with
a
good
friend
and
enjoyed
the
experience
nothing
too
special
about
this
though
edit
the
next
5
bottles
in
the
sixer
i
bought
didnt
have
that
salty
thing
i
mentioned
before
maybe
it
was
my
palate
and
not
the
beer
so
i
enjoyed
the
next
five
bottles
but
still
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
of
those
classic
belgian
flavors
i
also
wish
you
could
get
a
better
head
you
really
have
to
pour
hard
to
get
anything
going
anyway
im
bumping
my
taste
score
up
a
half
point
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
just
something
seems
off
on
this
one
this
beer
pours
orange
light
amber
and
is
slightly
hazy
the
head
is
minimal
bright
white
and
leaves
fairly
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
fruity
and
spicy
with
plenty
of
white
pepper
and
some
clove
though
it
is
not
overpowering
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
with
a
very
round
fruity
malt
sweetness
that
is
accentuated
by
the
spicy
yeast
and
soft
herbal
hops
while
not
as
pronounced
as
usual
for
this
style
i
am
definitely
picking
up
some
pear
and
green
apple
notes
this
is
a
very
mild
rendition
of
a
triple
but
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
i
am
very
much
enjoying
drinking
this
medium
body
with
a
nice
soft
mouthfeel
that
could
maybe
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
for
style
but
is
pleasant
none
the
less
this
is
one
extremely
drinkable
triple
and
while
it
may
not
be
exactly
to
style
i
still
find
it
to
be
a
solid
offering
a
bit
too
much
clove
not
enough
fruit
not
enough
complexity
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
so
far
everything
ive
had
by
dark
horse
has
been
great
or
fairly
good
this
falling
into
the
latter
group
better
tripels
out
there
but
not
always
available
in
a
12oz
portion
as
this
is
drinkability
a
slightly
above
average
tripel
the
spicing
is
good
and
hits
the
mark
however
nothing
really
jumped
out
to
me
about
this
one
md
medium
carbonation
lots
of
fine
carbonation
makes
for
a
slicker
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
okay
i
would
get
sick
of
this
after
2
or
so
smells
of
fruit
and
spice
the
taste
is
of
apple
and
spice
clove
very
good
d
i
always
look
for
this
beer
when
it
comes
into
season
nice
springtime
beer
could
and
have
drank
a
sixer
of
this
d
not
up
on
my
list
as
a
session
beer
due
to
the
8
5
abv
but
very
enjoyable
will
come
back
for
this
one
later
in
the
summer
drinkability
was
good
id
have
another
not
la
fin
du
monde
but
a
very
respectable
tripel
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
most
clove
i
have
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
the
smell
was
great
for
the
style
but
upon
tasting
i
was
overwhelmed
and
squinted
from
the
cloves
i
love
most
beers
that
come
from
dark
horse
but
this
is
not
on
my
wish
list
i
should
give
it
another
try
but
i
dont
know
if
i
can
its
easy
to
drink
once
you
get
past
the
alcohol
but
i
think
i
really
needed
to
have
it
fresh
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
from
an
american
brewery
it
tastes
like
an
authentic
belgian
ale
quite
the
murky
trip
ale
with
a
deep
bronzegolden
body
and
a
bright
white
head
pretty
clouded
lacing
is
fine
and
even
carbonation
was
effervescent
and
smooth
versus
most
of
the
recent
dark
horse
brews
ive
had
with
supper
fizzy
carbonation
blasts
of
sugar
and
booze
tropical
fruit
including
mango
and
pineapple
for
sure
theres
a
bit
of
nutty
yeast
like
notes
and
mild
spices
flavor
brings
out
more
tropical
fruit
content
with
excellent
spicing
balance
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
enough
to
make
it
a
rough
experience
slightly
fusel
the
yeast
doughnut
combo
is
almost
like
one
of
those
italian
nougat
desserts
not
much
in
the
way
of
an
evident
hop
profile
here
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
cloying
with
residual
sugars
this
one
has
a
ton
of
malt
in
it
carbonation
is
better
than
most
of
their
other
offerings
still
not
world
class
but
acceptable
drinkability
is
solid
an
americanized
version
of
the
style
one
of
the
better
ones
in
that
regards
but
compared
to
a
belgian
tripel
its
hard
to
compare
the
two
not
sure
if
a
whole
lot
of
love
went
into
this
triple
a
bigger
body
and
more
fruit
would
have
been
nice
in
the
mean
time
ill
go
to
my
staple
of
mad
bitch
and
be
content
if
dh
would
have
named
this
a
saison
than
i
would
have
been
satisfied
a
ok
attempt
that
perhaps
will
be
tweaked
in
the
future
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
a
cloudy
golden
color
possibly
unfiltered
and
well
carbonated
the
overwhelming
smell
i
detect
is
canned
fruit
either
peaches
or
general
fruit
cocktail
very
sweet
and
syrupy
the
taste
is
actually
much
more
sour
best
described
as
yeasty
lemon
juice
theres
not
much
of
the
spiciness
found
in
many
tripels
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
but
the
taste
just
isnt
that
pleasant
drinkability
the
booze
and
the
mouthfeel
are
factors
here
that
slow
down
the
session
more
than
should
be
but
seeing
thats
its
like
12f
outside
the
significant
warming
is
actually
welcomed
a
prety
good
example
of
the
style
overall
an
okay
tripel
i
would
avoid
this
one
next
time
ill
stick
to
the
true
belgians
as
the
ones
ive
had
have
been
outstanding
a
nice
apple
ciderish
orange
color
with
minimal
white
head
smell
is
of
sugar
and
alcohol
phenols
some
cloves
taste
is
fruity
with
nice
alcoholic
notes
to
it
apples
and
spiced
rum
creamy
and
very
effervescent
a
somewhat
dry
finish
drinkability
is
fine
for
that
abv
but
i
probably
wont
be
having
it
again
d
not
the
best
belgian
but
not
terrible
for
an
american
attempt
at
the
style
not
dark
horses
best
brew
by
a
long
shot
dark
horse
makes
some
really
good
beers
and
some
not
so
really
good
sapient
trip
ale
is
about
as
bastardized
a
version
of
the
style
as
its
spelling
of
it
would
let
on
in
all
fairness
however
it
might
have
earned
and
may
deserve
higher
scores
than
the
ones
posted
above
if
it
werent
for
the
fact
that
the
best
examples
of
this
style
also
just
so
happen
to
be
some
of
the
best
examples
of
beer
period
some
ok
hops
and
flowers
nothing
that
you
would
go
out
and
look
for
d
this
triple
has
come
work
to
do
to
fix
itself
a
bit
but
its
close
it
also
could
be
a
bit
old
too
the
alcohol
really
hinders
it
in
the
drinkability
category
do
to
its
high
level
its
too
offputting
because
it
dominates
everything
else
not
a
bad
beer
though
feel
and
drinkability
this
is
one
that
is
easy
enough
to
drink
and
one
that
i
rather
enjoy
feel
is
mediumlight
bodied
and
works
well
for
what
this
beer
is
finish
is
semidry
and
theres
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
there
this
is
one
that
ill
not
hesitate
to
buy
again
however
ill
be
going
after
more
tripels
before
i
come
back
to
this
one
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
ill
want
to
try
more
before
coming
back
to
this
one
a
solid
offering
d
pretty
good
triple
i
was
very
impressed
i
really
like
dark
horses
stouts
but
this
is
a
totally
different
style
i
wasnt
expecting
something
like
this
from
dark
horse
well
done
this
beer
pours
an
light
amberorange
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
orange
and
lemon
zest
and
floral
funk
it
is
a
nice
aroma
but
could
be
a
little
more
forward
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
less
prominent
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
which
i
consider
way
too
light
for
a
tripel
carbonation
is
also
to
low
for
the
style
overall
this
tripel
leave
almost
everything
to
be
desired
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
again
notes
i
am
disappointed
due
to
the
potential
that
this
beer
had
i
will
take
merry
monks
from
weyerbacher
any
day
over
this
tripel
i
was
happy
to
see
sapient
back
on
the
shelves
for
the
season
it
was
my
introduction
to
dark
horse
last
year
the
color
is
an
odd
cloudy
orange
with
a
white
bubbly
head
that
does
not
retain
for
to
long
the
smell
is
a
little
boozy
with
banana
bread
raisin
and
spice
the
flavor
is
similar
with
an
accent
on
the
spice
and
a
backing
of
almost
bitter
alcohol
i
could
only
take
a
couple
of
these
in
a
row
i
would
guess
the
alcohol
with
mellow
with
time
my
memory
of
this
beer
from
last
year
is
a
little
better
than
this
experience
i
will
have
to
lay
one
down
for
a
little
while
and
see
how
it
is
around
christmas
drinkability
is
respectable
more
balanced
than
some
of
its
genre
and
adequately
tasty
alcohol
is
present
without
ever
becoming
so
prominent
that
you
really
start
dwelling
on
it
it
pretty
much
tastes
like
it
smells
and
if
you
enjoy
tripels
then
this
one
is
a
good
bargan
if
you
can
get
it
for
about
10
bones
per
six
pack
drinkability
is
pretty
good
sometimes
i
like
the
spicy
character
in
tripels
sometimes
not
so
much
which
this
is
one
of
those
times
but
thats
just
personal
since
this
beer
fits
the
style
reasonably
well
d
im
iffy
on
this
beer
its
not
terribly
bad
per
se
but
on
the
whole
it
comes
off
as
too
murky
it
it
approachable
just
do
so
with
caution
hazy
amber
gold
with
a
medium
size
bubbly
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
film
and
streaks
of
wet
lacing
not
sure
whats
going
on
with
the
aroma
from
this
bottle
fairly
pungent
and
sour
strong
dark
fruitiness
mild
alcohol
burn
not
very
pleasant
all
together
medium
creamy
body
with
sharp
carbonation
and
a
mild
alcohol
finish
though
the
mouthfeel
is
much
softer
and
less
crisp
than
i
would
expect
for
this
style
flavor
is
of
malt
and
candy
sugar
fruity
but
again
some
lingering
sourness
ill
have
to
review
this
beer
again
when
i
get
another
bottle
since
this
doesnt
seem
to
match
other
reviews
well
but
nothing
seems
obviously
wrong
pours
a
murky
golden
color
with
a
lot
of
particulate
matter
involved
the
head
was
small
and
faded
almost
immediatly
just
a
little
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
a
lot
of
spice
malt
and
brown
sugar
smells
more
like
a
quad
some
alcohol
is
also
detected
starts
of
with
a
sweet
taste
but
it
is
fleeting
the
spice
and
malt
takeover
and
dominate
the
flavor
a
little
warmth
is
sensed
in
the
finish
this
tripel
is
missing
the
vinous
and
fruit
qualities
i
love
in
them
medium
body
and
nice
carbonation
goes
well
with
the
flavors
not
that
good
of
a
tripel
but
it
is
a
nice
belgian
type
beer
murky
goldenbrown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
quickly
receding
head
smell
is
strong
spices
caramel
clove
and
super
sweet
dark
fruit
taste
is
upfront
malt
overload
before
the
subtle
spices
kick
in
to
wash
it
down
no
sting
or
harshness
from
the
spices
which
i
often
find
to
be
the
case
but
there
is
a
bit
of
an
odd
lingering
cinnamonnutmeg
on
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
very
easy
drinking
not
bigger
than
medium
bodied
but
there
is
a
slight
sense
of
creaminess
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
simply
because
it
is
not
a
preferred
style
but
i
definitely
would
recommend
it
to
others
another
dark
horse
drinkable
treat
this
one
at
ashleys
ontap
hazy
light
golden
with
caesar
head
decent
yeast
aroma
above
average
mouthfeel
good
fresh
yeastiness
and
it
is
fruitybannana
and
apricot
with
some
bitter
hop
in
the
finish
a
sipper
very
good
offering
from
dark
horse
i
will
pick
this
up
again
overall
not
a
bad
attempt
its
a
good
beer
kind
of
a
homebrew
tinge
to
it
but
over
all
decent
id
like
to
try
this
one
at
the
bar
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
1
head
that
leaves
a
nice
fresh
ring
til
the
end
the
smell
is
good
lots
of
fruits
in
this
one
bananas
apples
pears
melons
spices
like
coriander
cumin
pepper
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
the
same
as
b4
mentioned
smell
with
some
sweet
malts
and
belgium
yeast
tastes
that
nicely
balance
the
fruit
and
spice
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
that
is
well
balanced
with
nothing
dominating
the
palete
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
like
this
one
and
several
other
dark
horse
offerings
a
top
notch
brewery
from
michigan
recommended
eric
the
beer
does
a
lot
to
immulate
whats
going
on
in
traditional
belgian
tripel
ales
but
the
lack
of
hop
flavor
and
the
richer
textures
to
start
are
just
a
few
reminders
that
this
is
in
fact
a
belgianinspired
american
tripel
ale
d
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
triple
style
its
got
all
the
right
flavors
in
the
right
places
but
its
still
a
triple
and
thus
is
indeed
a
sipper
but
a
good
summer
sipper
at
that
the
smell
department
was
very
disappointing
though
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
bit
of
alcohol
comes
across
but
not
enough
to
make
it
less
drinkable
overall
a
decent
tripel
12oz

belgian
yeasts

a

somewhat
syrupy

overripe

well
alcohol

present
and
warming
on
the
throat
finishes
dry
with
some
white
grape
flavors
and
some
spiciness
white
pepper
perhaps
decent
tripel
and
represents
the
style
finely
i
just
find
it
very
hard
to
compete
with
the
authentic
belgians
still
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
this
beer
is
one
of
the
worst
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
dont
care
for
belgian
ales
to
begin
with
but
this
exibits
flavors
that
are
pretty
offensive
not
recommended
but
give
it
a
try
if
you
are
feeling
brave
this
was
a
decent
beer
if
i
want
a
tripel
there
are
far
better
examples
of
the
style
but
if
offered
this
again
i
would
gladly
drink
it

nice

nothing

do

this
is
merely
ok
i
dont
find
the
yeast
strain
all
that
interesting
and
as
previously
mentioned
i
think
it
needs
to
be
a
tad
sweeter
worth
a
try
but
not
something
id
be
likely
to
come
back
to
d
this
is
really
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
had
this
the
brewery
and
really
enjoyed
it
w
pizza
overall
this
was
a
solid
trippel
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
that
being
said
i
still
appreciate
shrlsu
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
this
ive
had
my
eye
on
this
one
for
a
while
and
i
must
say
that
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
my
only
past
experience
with
a
tripel
was
via
the
good
folks
at
chimay
but
this
one
kept
me
quite
intrigued
throughout
the
entire
glass
another
solid
offering
from
dark
horse
very
much
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
in
your
area
this
is
a
decent
tripel
though
probably
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
still
pretty
drinkable
this
is
the
worst
by
far
of
the
dark
horse
beers
that
i
had
but
its
not
horrible
by
any
means
and
it
might
be
a
good
introduction
to
a
new
style
of
ale
for
novice
drinkers
d
bitter
taste
that
does
not
go
down
easily
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
conclusion
dark
horse
has
an
ok
beer
here
but
nothing
special
their
true
genius
lies
in
their
ct
and
dct
ipas
for
the
price
id
deft
pick
up
a
4
pack
of
la
fin
du
monde
instead
out
of
the
bottle
i
would
recommend
pouring
half
swirling
the
remaining
contents
in
the
bottle
and
pouring
the
rest
to
get
all
of
the
yeast
into
the
glass
i
noticed
a
fair
amount
of
yeast
left
in
the
bottle
when
i
did
not
follow
this
procedure
definitely
a
solid
tripel
from
dark
horse
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
helping
to
make
this
an
easy
drinker
d
very
drinkable
overall
good
d
dont
like
this
one
much
i
am
enjoying
dark
horses
offerings
more
and
more
luckily
they
are
not
that
far
away
d
killer
drinkability
no
abv
listed
but
i
can
bet
its
pretty
high
who
cares
id
still
session
this
one
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
better
tripels
our
there
imo
especially
for
an
american
take
on
the
style
i
think
im
a
sucker
for
the
hops
and
the
high
level
of
malt
sweetness
in
this
one
is
just
the
perfect
balance
for
the
flavors
presented
here
pours
a
dark
cloudy
gold
in
color
with
a
slight
ring
of
froth
sitting
on
top
there
are
a
bunch
of
floating
yeasties
in
the
glass
smell
and
taste
is
very
yeasty
and
musty
taste
there
is
some
pear
flavors
as
well
as
slight
bubblegum
decent
mouthfeel
a
little
cloying
and
tiring
i
love
dark
horse
brewing
but
this
was
a
miss
for
me
overall
i
think
of
this
as
a
near
miss
on
the
style
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
im
betting
from
my
armchair
that
a
different
yeast
and
a
little
wheat
could
make
this
good
beer
into
a
great
beer
poured
into
my
westmalle
chalice
a
hazy
orange
color
with
yellow
around
the
edges
no
foam
and
very
little
lacing
has
a
powdery
cottoncandy
aroma
with
hints
of
grassiness
and
light
citrus
zip
a
sweet
malty
nose
to
say
the
least
plenty
of
tropical
fruit
flavors
certainly
sweet
notes
of
licorice
pineapple
pear
and
light
citrus
some
bready
malts
make
their
way
to
the
front
midsip
and
turns
somewhat
dry
and
yeasty
on
the
finish
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
but
its
wellhidden
as
there
is
not
much
of
a
warming
effect
full
bodied
almost
creamy
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
going
on
drinkability
is
on
the
lower
side
as
i
usually
prefer
tripels
as
a
sipper
as
i
get
further
into
the

the
alcohol
lets
itself
be
known

nice
version
of
the
style

white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
of
a
typical
belgian
some
alochol
fruit
and
a
sweet
malt
taste
is
good
but
a
bit
much
on
the
candi
sugar
side
some
sweet
fruit
malt
and
a
light
grassy
and
alcohol
bite
to
it
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
a
bit
on
the
light
side
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
amazing
something
about
this
was
just
a
little
lacking
for
me
perhaps
it
was
just
a
little
too
much
like
many
others
of
this
style
and
it
didnt
stand
out
im
not
sure
what
the
abv
of
this
brew
is
but
watch
out
for
me
this
one
was
certainly
enough
the
heavy
nature
and
the
strong
alcohol
content
make
it
deliciously
dangerous
this
would
make
a
great
capper
or
even
an
event
in
itself
the
artwork
on
the
bottle
is
deadon
appropriate
edit
i
should
have
been
more
patient
as
this
glass
warmed
the
alcohol
bite
disappeared
and
the
beer
became
much
more
balanced
as
a
result
i
took
my
taste

very
interesting
flavors
not
my
favorite
tripel

not
terrible

banana
yeast
taste
follows
right
along
with
a
slight
burning
alcohol
taste
and
a
bit
of
bubblegum
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
thin
to
me
boozy
aftertaste
its
good
im
not
losing
my
mind
over
it
but
i
can
see
this
pairing
up
nicely
with
the
right
meal
drinkability
this
is
a
little
off
the
beaten
path
of
the
classic
tripel
example
cant
say
i
cared
for
it
too
much
compared
to
most
dark
horse
stuff
way
too
boozy
for
it
to
be
a
revisited
beer
d
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
have
a
couple
of
these
even
though
its
pretty
strong
an
interesting
choice
for
a
summer
seasonal
brew
this
certainly
was
my
wifes
cousins
favorite
beer
of
the
night
certainly
a
well
crafted
belgium
ale
it
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
very
slight
head
it
was
pretty
much
exactally
how
a
belian
ale
should
taste
imo
but
they
are
not
my
favorite
so
oh
well
the
smell
was
nice
and
the
flavors
were
very
deep
i
am
not
sure
what
the
overlying
flavor
is
but
its
the
same
flavor
from
all
the
other
belgian
ales
i
have
drank
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
i
would
suggest
it
to
any
belgian
ale
lovers
out
there
this
is
a
struggle
to
get
through
my
first
impression
is
fermentation
problems
too
hot
too
soon
thanks
to
iceicebaby
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
out
served
in
my
delirium
tremens
tulip
poured
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
very
little
light
penetration
halfinch
offwhite
head
dissipated
within
seconds
into
a
light
oily
slick
remnants
coalesced
around
the
perimeter
into
a
thin
band
of
foam
nose
consists
of
candy
sugar
light
fruit
and
a
trace
of
the
alcohol
character
is
revealed
but
not
at
all
boozy
flavors
consistent
with
nose
perhaps
a
hint
of
peach
as
well
as
a
subtle
spicy
character
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
in
consistency
gravitating
slightly
towards
syrupy
but
not
unpleasantly
so
also
a
light
effervescence
present
across
the
palate
and
tongue
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
packs
a
punch
im
twothirds
through
and
really
starting
to
feel
it
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
of
the
line
not
a
bad
tripel
but
not
my
favorite
either
it
lacks
the
complexity
that
characterizes
belgian
tripels
not
one
to
reject
outright
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
around
drinkability
has
some
potential
sure
but
as
it
stands
its
not
the
tripel
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
with
moderately
strong
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
unexpected
for
an
american
belgianstyle
triple
its
good
but
just
not
terribly
remarkable
overall
drinkablity
is
limited
due
to
abv
and
how
much
this
demands
to
be
drunk
slowly
and
enjoyed
an
interesting
take
on
a
the
style
and
definately
stronger
than
most
d
overall
this
was
one
rather
tasty
tripel
that
exceeded
my
expectations
it
had
a
ton
of
flavor
and
was
easy
to
drink
as
well
my
one
criticism
was
that
the
nose
did
not
come
close
to
mirroring
the
other
factors
of
this
beer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
and
served
in
a
tulip
this
beer
poured
a
bright
orange
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
thin
head
of
offwhite
foam
not
much
lace
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
made
up
of
oranges
spicy
yeast
and
some
bread
the
flavor
was
much
the
same
with
a
more
pronounced
hoppy
citrus
note
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
fullbodied
with
mild
carbonation
a
pretty
decent
tripel
sapient
trip
ale
is
a
fine
beer
overall
but
simply
nothing
great
its
good
but
could
use
some
more
depth
complexity
and
carbonation
to
up
its
status
on
my
tripel
list
a
gentle
beer
and
tasty
too
spicy
clove
in
the
flavor
with
a
big
wheaty
yeastenhanced
mouthfeel
bitter
lemon
peel
sweetness
is
there
but
in
check
some
phenols
tingle
the
palate
it
feels
a
little
heavier
than
the
first
time
i
tried
this
on
tap
easy
to
have
a
couple
bottles
or
drafts
very
drinkable
with
a
sweet
and
fruity
flavor
profile
no
off
flavors
here
high
abv
is
concealed
i
could
go
for
more
complexity
in
a
true
belgian
tripel
but
this
really
isnt
bad
at
all
overall
a
very
good
american
belgian
tripel
which
seems
to
becoming
the
norm
these
days
from
a
brewery
im
very
proud
to
have
in
the
midwest
sapient
adj
having
or
showing
great
wisdom
or
sound
judgment
anyone
who
is
a
huge
fan
of
belgian

would
show
great

and
impeccable

in
choosing

it
is
an
interesting
enough
tripel
to
hold
my
interest
if
only
i
had
a
second
third
and
fourth
bottle
i
obviously
need
to
get
back
to
the
midwest
soon
pours

a

murky
straw
colored

with
tiny
bits
of
sedimet
floating
around
the
glass

an
almost
white
inch
and
a
half
of
fuzzy
foam
that
leaves
lots
of
consistant
lace
on
the
glass
nose
is
full
of
sweet
floral
notes
ans
spicey
vanilla
banana
and
yeast
as
you
take
first
sip
you
get
a
syruty
battle
of
thick
sweetness
and
a
slight
tangy
sour
spiceyness
there
is
a
smooth
creamy
feel
to
the
mouth
all
over
created
by
the
yeasty
sweetness
jlavors
of
mellon
honey
vanilla
and
softly
rich
spice
makes
up
a
solid
palate
this
is
nicely
drinkable
but
very
sweet
slightly
unbalanced
feel
keeps
it
from
being
rated
a
bit
higher
d
kind
of
a
yeasty
aftertaste
that
leaves
your
mouth
a
bit
sour
and
pasty
but
this
beer
is
good
nonetheless
overall
impression
honey
malt
and
candi
sugar
taken
to
the
logical
conclusion
good
flavors
simply
done
good
stuff
cloudy
golden
color
but
zip
for
head
no
lacing
due
to
the
total
lack
of
a
cap
on
this
one
smell
of
candied
sugar
sweetness
and
belgian
yeast
spicyness
sweetness
takes
the
forefront
in
the
taste
too
some
citrus
fruityness
shows
itself
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
but
not
enough
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
it
just
dosnt
hold
my
interest
the
sweetness
becomes
cloying
and
drinkability
really
suffers
a
really
have
no
interest
in
trying
this
one
again
this
was
okay
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
overall
it
seemed
very
flawed
to
me
while
still
drinkable
not
worth
drinking
again
d
just
another
tripel
on
the
market
not
bad
overall
i
would
probably
not
grab
this
brew
again
it
might
be
skunked
i
guess
i
could
give
it
a
shot
however
i
dont
know
how
much
better
it
would
be
fresh
the
mouthfeel
is
average
to
solid
in
respects
to
the
style
d
lacks
the
complexity
of
a
good
belgian
tripel
yet
i
found
this
to
be
strangely
appealing
quite
easy
to
drink
a
medium
bodied
selection
with
a
somewhat
heavy
breadlike
texture
moderate
carbonation
thins
out
the
starchiness
a
bit
a
classic
tripel
for
the
most
part
flavorful
and
well
balanced
a
very
solid
selection
certainly
worth
a
try
drinkability
its
a
decent
attempt
on
a
belgian
trippel
a
few
years
wouldnt
hurt
it
maybe
mellow
it
out
some
and
meld
the
flavors
i
gotta
be
in
a
mood
to
drink
a
high
octane
brew
like
this
again
but
it
happens
now
and
then
this
is
a
good
american
made
representation
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
solid
pale
malt
scent
along
with
an
earthyfruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
it
appears
warm
with
some
sweet
malt
character
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
i
actually
like
the
taste
its
sweet
yet
very
smooth
with
some
belgian
fruit
esters
its
not
very
aggressive
with
an
in
your
face
alcohol
blast
there
is
a
bit
of
earthiness
in
the
finish
i
feel
its
too
sweet
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tastey
beer
im
just
not
sure
how
true
to
style
it
really
is
overall
pretty
solid
brew
well
made
and
i
like
how
drinkable
it
is
but
the
flavors
were
not
quite
as
vibrant
and
enticing
as
some
others
in
the
style
fruity
notes
seemed
a
bit
toned
back
with
spicyness
taking
a
front
seat
cheers
d
this
beer
had
some
nice
flavor
but
not
very
complex
especially
for
this
style
it
didnt
really
have
any
sweetness
and
the
bitterness
was
much
stronger
than
most
beers
in
this
style
pours
darker
than
most
tripels
ive
experienced
so
far
and
seems
a
lot
cloudier
as
well
a
dark
apple
juice
color
with
a
shallow
white
head
thats
gone
in
a
flash
a
little
bit
of

at
the
end
smells
a
little
heavier
and
spicier
medium
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
less
carbonated
than
most
also
the
texture
is
on
the
syrupy
side
the
flavor
is
good
spicy
and
yeasty
i
think
its
a
really
nice
drinker
but
im
not
sure
how
true
style
it
is
im
really
glad
that
i
was
able
to
experience

according
to
the
web
site
i
think
i
could
go
back
for
a
few
of
these
i
think
i
might
be
a
sucker
for
tripels
because
they
never
seem
to
disappoint
me
with
the
possible
exception
of
golden
monkey
this
one
goes
up
there
with
the

a
really
fantastic
beer
that
ill
look
for
again
this
could
easily
be
an
obese
gooey
blob
of
a
tripel
but
the
persistent
tiny
carbonation
slakes
the
mouth
and
forms
scaffolding
that
brace
the
sweetness
to
give
it
support
and
functionality
and
create
a
numbingly
drinkable
nectar
in
the
literal
sense
as
this
often
seems
pollinated
rather
than
brewed
d
for
a
belgian
tripel
this
was
dangerously
easy
to
consume
still
somewhat
on
the
sweeter
side

still
rather
tasty
nicely

a
really
nice

is
getting
to
be
a
favorite
brewery
and
this
beer
is
right
in
line
with
that
i
gave
it
a
3
5
because
its
not
something
i
would
choose
to
drink
often
but
its
good
just
a
plain
version
of
a
tripel
its
a
little
over
spiced
like
too
much
corriander
and
pepper
flavors
the
malt
is
too
mellow
and
while
its
smooth
theres
no
depth
to
the
taste
the
only
redeeming
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
its
high
alcohol
and
pretty
drinkable

pretty

this
is
the

that
i

i
really

these
guys
are
the
real
deal
seek
them
out

available

half
of
a
pint
it
gets
a
little
hard
to
sup
cantelope
smack
finish
of
sweet
sugar
and
grapes
almost
feel
like
im
drinking
a
glass
of
koolaid
or
juice
with
this
between
the
honey
lack
of
alcohol
and
no
carbonation
either
this
take
on
the
style
isnt
for
me
or
i
got
an
off
bottle
ill
have
to
try
again
some
day
and
update
if
necessary
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
tripel
a
light
amber
body
props
up
a
solid
frothy
head
that
leaves
slight
lacing
this
beer
seems
to
be
almost
meady
with
its
honey
sweetness
little
spice
perhaps
a
bit
too
dry
on
the
end
the
alcohol
is
nice
very
drinkable
great
tripel
color
cantaloupe
and
honey
with
some
orange
as
well
but
hardly
any
carbonation
lacing
or
bubbling
doesnt
look
like
a
tripel
to
me
the
aroma
is
a
very
sweet
fruity
and
suagry
malt
the
flavor
makes
me
think
of
candied
apples
honeydew
and
cantaloupe
an
overall
candy
like
beer
the
palate
was
ok
but
take
into
consideration
the
lack
of
carbonation
this
is
not
a
real
tripel
if
you
cant
feel
the
carbonation
d
i
wont
get
it
again
its
far
too
sweet
for
the
style
imo
this
is
the
first
of
any
of
the
dark
horse
brews
that
i
have
had
to
say
the
least
i
am
impressed
this
is
a
very
interesting
belgian
trippel
that
i
would
buy
again

poured
out
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
hazy
peachy
gold
color
with
a
sparkly
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
rim
lacing
is
good
and
slides
down
the
glass
with
the
beer
smell
is
of
spice
and
cloves
taste
is
initially
of
hops
but
is
quickly
overpowered
with
a
bananacaramel
malt
taste
aftertaste
is
good
and
lasting
definitely
of
malt
and
a
slight
tinge
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
very
good
a
light
bodied
beer
with
excellent
carbonation
it
dances
on
the
tongue
and
finishes
smooth
this
beer
is
a
good
tasting
beer
but
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
too
many
of
them
in
one
night
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
a
nightcap
id
say
the
drinkability
is
better
than
good
pours
out
a
cloudy
dark
honey
color
with
big
white
creamy
head
big
drippy
lacing
smells
are
hefelike
phenols
alcohol
honey
and
a
very
faint
spice
this
is
a
very
light
and
fresh
tasting
beer
honey
berry
fig
sugar
peppery
spice
grassy
flavor
and
tart
alcohol
come
out
more
or
less
in
that
order
mouthfeel
is
midbodied
with
very
active
but
really
teenytiny
carbonation
bubbles
that
give
it
an
overall
fuzziness
may
come
off
a
little
flimsy
compared
to
its
begian
couterparts
but
for
the
price
difference
it
is
well
worth
considering
mouthfeel
is
sweet
sugary
medium
bodied
and
warming
overall
impression
nicely
done
not
the
typical
punchinyourface
yeasty
trippel
seemed
very
balanced
and
accented
the
ripe
fruit
characters
well
another
good
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
no
thank
you
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
syrupy
needs
a
bit
more
dryness
definitely
needs
something
to
balance
out
the
banana
as
well
or
at
least
less
of
it
drinkable
but
could
be
much
better
this
is
the
weakest
of
the
dark
horse
beers
my
roommate
brought
back
from
mi
this
bottle
had
to
have
been
aged
over
two
years
it
was
old
when
i
got
it
and
ive
had
it
forever
aside
from
that
i
cant
wonder
where
all
the
mor
reviews
are
coming
from
this
is
an
exceptional
americanbelgian
light
copper
color
with
short
white
head
odor
is
of
spices
and
alcohol
taste
is
not
super
strong
some
sourness
lots
of
alcohol
evident
i
actually
like
it
because
most
tripels
are
too
spiceystrong
for
my
taste
a
vaguely
malty
finish
good
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
alcohol
hits
hard
this
has
got
to
be
above
67
good
drinkability
i
would
recommend
it
overall
impression
individually
all
the
traits
of
this
beer
seem
good
but
when
you
add
it
all
up
it
comes
up
a
bit
short
nothing
particular
it
just
didnt
strike
me
as
a
great
example
of
the
style
still
tasty
but
not
great
taste
is
ok
not
belgian
enough
for
me
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
which
is
good
for
this
beer
i
think
drinkability
is
average
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
get
excited
and
run
to
the
store
about
a
nice
offering
especially
among
a
limited
selection
the
mediumbody
is
smooth
and
enjoyable
but
what
detracts
from
the
beers
drinakbility
is
its
sweetness
a
noble
though
slightly
flawed
effort
at
a
difficult
style
from
dark
horse
this
is
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
happen
to
come
across
it
but
probably
not
worth
adding
to
a
list
of
musttrys
the
mouth
is
full
with
the
citric
notes
and
carbonation
cutting
through
and
washing
everything
clean
a
solid
triple
i
could
drink
a
sixer
over
the
course
of
a
night
taste
yeasty
bread
dough
as
with
the
nose
the
bananas
and
cloves
really
come
through
and
it
has
a
bit
of
a
citrus
zing
to
it
slightly
sweet
on
the
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
this
was
much
better
than
i
had
anticipated
mouthfeel
was
was
full
and
just
a
bit
syrupy
really
good
beer
a
good
place
to
start
when
getting
into
tripels
dark
horse
has
got
this
one
down
poured
out
to
a
slightly
hazy
rich
yellow
golden
color
wiht
an
nice
12
inch
head
no
lace
noted
medium
carbonation
aromas
could
have
been
stronger
but
hints
of
zesty
yeast
and
weak
hops
were
noted
the
taste
was
complex
and
very
well
balanced
flavors
of
buttery
biscuts
malt
yeast
and
some
citrus
notes
meshed
very
well
finished
crisp
and
a
bit
dry
quite
sweet
all
around
good
drinkability
this
would
go
well
with
many
meals
or
just
fine
on
its
own
recommended
this
beer
finishes
a
bit
heavy
but
it
is
clean
and
very
quaffable
i
like
it
i
would
buy
it
again
i
would
like
it
more
with
its
sweetness
if
it
had
a
more
pronounced
yeast
character
to
go
with
it
its
nice
to
see
d
horse
stray
from
the
british
iles
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
is
an
eminently
flavorful
and
very
sippable
beer
it
carries
enough
bite
to
be
substantal
and
is
definately
a
dark
horse
among
american
brewed
belgians
pours
a
deep
goldlight
copper
with
w
quite
persistent
12
inch
white
head
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
tropical
fruits
coriander
and
pepper
quite
a
lovely
smelling
brew
flavor
doesnt
have
quite
the
depth
that
the
aroma
would
suggest
beginning
slightly
sweet
then
finishing
with
some
light
fruit
and
spice
notes
as
it
warmed
a
bit
the
flavor
began
to
take
a
little
more
shape
has
a
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
quite
smooth
actually
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
pretty
much
right
on
for
the
style
the
taste
and
feel
of
this
beer
run
together
to
deliver
a
smooth
and
delicious
treat
well
drinkable
density
in
body
the
spice
factor
is
just
perfect
here
no
overbeering
attributes
to
the
flavour
in
my
estimation
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
chambly
stock
delightful
and
soothing
brilliant
sweetness
that
never
becomes
a
burden
the
flavours
dance
across
the
palate
creating
a
crisp
brunt
and
a
welcome
afterglow
of
sweetness
the
spice
character
that
so
often
overemphasizes
the
belgian
style
is
tuned
to
precision
here
i
love
it
when
a
beer
i
hypothesize
to
be
be
not
my
cup
of
tea
turns
out
to
be
an
absolute
pleasure
to
consume
fine
craftsmanship
darkhorse
thanks
to
hopdog
for
a
great
trading
experience
i
highly
recommend
nice
a
drinkable
and
i
will
buy
again
when
in
indiana
in
general
i
would
say
this
beer
is
decent
but
i
expect
great
things
from
belgian
style
beers
and
for
my
money
this
isnt
even
the
best
example
of
the
breed
from
michigan
dragonmeads
final
absolution
worth
a
try
but
i
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
this
is
a
good
beer
worth
trying
but
i
am
not
going
to
stock
up
on
it
by
the
way
my
wife
has
said
i
am
nuts
it
does
not
smell
like
hot
dogs

take
on

i
have
to
say
that
is
an
interesting
label
on
this
beer
and
the
beer
inside
is
just
as
interesting

with
a
strong
english
ale
and
you
get
this
first
sip
gives
the
appearance
of
a
hefe
but
it
immedately
fades
into
the
fruityness
that
tripples
are
known
for
nice
hop
presence
also
not
sipcy
at
all
just
a
nice
presence
due
to
its
complexity
it
lowers
the
drinkability
that
is
to
say
you
cant
drink
a
bunch
of
them
a
very
nice
beer
i
have
to
disagree
with
one
reviewers
belief
that
this
is
a
fairly
low
abv
beer
i
was
feeling
woozy
about
halfway
through
this
was
99
on
my
ratebeer
site
thought
i
would
finish
with
2
mich
beers
poured
cloudy
yellow
gold
with
a
medium
sized
head
aroma
citrus
yeast
some
sweetness
fruity
flavor
fruity
sweet
like
pineapple
and
hints
of
orange
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
wonder
if
this
might
benefit
from
aging
it
costs
about
89
bucks
a
sixer
i
should
try
it
i
finished
this
beer
with
my
dinner
of
omelet
and
toast
my
conclusion
is
that
this
would
make
a
great
breakfast
beer
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
12
of
white
head
over
the
cloudy
honey
amber
hued
brew
head
is
shortlived
but
returns
upon
swirling
and
laces
well
aroma
is
sweet
wheaty
lightly
fruity
and
alcohol
presence
is
apparent
taste
is
everything
the
nose
portends
it
to
be
which
is
great
seems
more
generic
bitterness
than
hops
character
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
drinkability
well
id
be
looking
for
another
if
i
had
one
another
dark
horse
to
be
rooting
for
thanks
tikigod
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
brew
hazy
copper
colored
murky
body
with
a
thin
white
film
of
head
sweet
bublegum
and
spice
aroma
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
sour
in
the
finish
theres
a
tanginess
and
brisk
carbonation
that
keeps
the
mouthfeel
light
there
were
a
couple
very
slight
off
flavors
but
nothing
to
keep
it
from
being
a
good
beer
ill
definatly
try
it
again
i
could
tell
this
wasnt
from
belgium
more
spices
too
sweet
not
as
dry
but
i
dont
really
care
thank
you
to
trbeer
for
the
gift
to
take
home
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
an
outstanding
tripel
maybe
those
who
prefer
it
on
the
drier
side
wouldnt
like
this
one
but
since
i
like
that
candi
sugar
sweetness
im
loving
this
one
im
just
upset
that
i
heard
that
dark
horse
was
coming
to
pittsburgh
but
i
confirmed
with
aaron
at
the
summer
beer
festival
that
event
was
far
away
which
is
a
shame
since
dark
horse
is
an
amazing
brewery
still
ill
be
enjoying
this
beer
whenever
i
get
the
chance
sampled
from
a
2l
growler
poured
a
clear
orangish
yellow
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
candied
sugar
on
the
nose
with
some
tropical
fruits
spice
flavors
of
butterscotch
banana
pineapple
and
spicy
yeast
very
syrupy
in
the
mouth
finishes
leaving
you
with
a
long
lasting
flavor
of
sweet
candy
fruit
licorice
definitely
a
unique
version
worth
trying
i
am
floored
one
of
the
best
trippels
ive
ever
had
let
alone
the
best
tripel
in
michigan
this
reminds
me
in
many
ways
of
unibroue
10
or
11
its
that
good
or
better
perfectly
drinkable
satisfying
complex
rich
what
can
i
say
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
highly
recommended
this
little
brewery
is
a
hidden
gem
get
on
board
and
try
their
beers
if
you
can
get
the
chance
hard
to
drink
to
much
of
this
more
of
a
strong
sipping
beer
what
a
great
american
tripel
i
think
i
may
prefer
great
lakes
brewing
anniversary
ale
but
this
beats
my
beloved
bells
sparkling
ale
hands
down
pours
a
cloudy
honey
and
mango
color
with
a
nice
lace
rim
smells
like
fresh
spring
air
theres
no
real
character
but
freshness
perhaps
after
a
rain
nicely
carbonated
fizzy
and
spunky
that
you
dont
taste
actual
flavors
until
swallowing
at
first
i
thought
i
perceived
an
orange
honey
yeast
and
tangelo
flavor
but
as
i
began
to
write
the
review
i
swiped
a
drink
without
concentrating
and
epiphany
this
tastes
like
a
malolactic
not
overoaked
california
style
chardonnay
with
a
yeast
and
malt
twist
the
very
final
note
of
flavor
is
in
the
aftertaste
bitter
but
understated
on
the
palate
it
is
sweet
and
juicy
with
pulpy
plump
red
apple
flesh
tangerine
hot
electrical
wires
and
powdered
sugar
there
is
a
naiive
candied
sweetness
to
this
beer
that
prevents
it
from
acheiving
much
better
than
average
drinkability
body
is
really
high
impossible
to
feel
the
alcohol
i
would
say
this
beer
deserves
a
bitter
ending
but
its
ok
overall
a
great
example
of
a
tripel
very
well
done
overall
very
smooth
drinkable
tripel
i
wish
it
had
more
aroma
i
am
glad
that
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
tons
of
taste
notes
long
lingering
finish
wheaty
and
hoppy
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
one
nice
clean
tripel

drink

i

rate
it

if

not

its
interesting
light

little
noticeable
effect
of

i
do
not
get
the
high
reviews
for
this
tripel
i
think
it
is
resoundingly
mediocre
yep
this
one
heck
of
a
good
tripel
in
my
book
pardon
me
while
i
sip
the
rest
of
the
bottle
away
of
all
the
belgian
made
authentic
triples
from
the
motherland
there
this
may
be
my
favorite
its
so
decadent
yet
drinkable
and
really
bright
in
feel
just
wonderful
blonde
and
hazy
radiant
though
and
glowing
brightly
huge
white
head
rises
well
above
the
rim
of
my
glass
the
nose
on
this
is
awesome
all
yeasty
warm
temperature
belgian
esters
of
sweet
raisin
vanilla
and
dried
grass
its
a
neat
complexion
over
the
blonde
barley
base
the
flavor
is
similarly
propelled
by
the
yeast
sweet
for
a
minute
but
drying
out
beautifully
in
the
finish
dynamic
and
layered
so
creamy
in
feel
rich
but
i
keep
drinking
it
faster
than
i
should
for
a
9
abv
beer
it
just
goes
down
too
easy
love
all
the
carbonation
and
the
way
it
lingers
with
just
a
hint
of
candy
sugar
in
the
finish
i
dont
get
a
ton
of
grain
nuance
in
this
one
but
its
simplicity
lets
the
yeast
just
rock
out
distinct
and
delicious
cant
say
enough
about
this
one
a
perfect
classic
example
of
the
belgian
tripel
style
very
tasty
but
be
careful
pouring
it
and
try
and
keep
the
yeast
dregs
out
of
your
glass
blegh
on
tap
at
rattle
n

nyc
nice
honey
colored
liquid
with
barely
any

delicate
lacing
and
deceptively
sweet
for
something
with
an
abv
of
9
not
much
on
the
nose
even
less
on
the
back
end
where
do
they
hide
the
alcohol
nicely
done
but
probably
good
for
just
the
one
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
had
although
faithful
to
style
it
has
a
character
of
its
own
and
an
elegant
and
complex
taste
thankfully
not
a
sugar
bomb
as
other
belgian
beers
highly
recommendable
this
must
have
been
a
bad
bottle
i
cant
imagine
it
was
designed
to
taste
this
way
a
few
tastes
into
it
and
its
surely
headed
for
the
drain
infection
really
really
old
no
bottle
date
no
idea
ill
try
to
revisit
this
someday
to
see
if
this
was
an
anomalous
experience
but
i
cant
imagine
someone
drinking
this
on
purpose
especially
as
a
tripel
was
hoping
to
like
this
better
the
tart
character
is
overpowering
rendering
the
beer
fairly
onenote
poured
in
to
a
tulip
dark
yellow
and
gold
wih
a
frothy
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
the
whole
beer
smell
of
banana
bread
and
sweet
alcohol
very
fruity
on
the
nose
like
a
grand
mariner
soaked
fruit
cake
taste
earthy
and
bready
up
front
sticks
to
the
mouth
with
a
light
alcohol
burning
moving
to
the
sweet

and
banana
notes
smooth
delicious
very
well
done
33cl
bottle
into
a
goblet
slightly
hazy
golden

with
a

that
slowly
came
down
to
half

carbonation
and
good

with
some

first
taste
with
some

thats
followed
by
a
dryish
lemony
aftertaste
with
some
hops
pepper
and
apricots
became
more
sweet
as
it
warmed
up
some
warmness
but
no
apparent
taste
of
alcohol
medium
body
and
a
high
carbonation
very
drinkable
i
great
enjoyed
the
finish
spicy
and
carbonated
this
is
an
outstanding
example
of
a
tripel
hits
all
the
bases
would
have
again
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
this
is
a
very
spoton
tripel
and
will
please
any
fans
of
the
style
it
doesnt
do
anything
special
to
set
itself
apart
from
others
in
the
style
so
how
much
anyone
likes
it
will
depend
mostly
on
their
particular
flavor
preferences
certainly
a
great
tripel
to
goto
as
traditional
belgian
tripels
go
this
one
is
in
the
same
neighborhood
as
chimay
and
la
fin
du
monde
for
my
tastes
just
a
touch
behind
westmalle
and
karmeliet
overall
extremely
unique
and
absolutely
worth
the
try
i
generally
like
a
little
more
malt
in
my
belgian
beers
so
this
wouldnt
become
a
gotobrew
for
me
still
this
is
excellent
overall
and
sure
stands
out
from
the
rest
gouden
carolus
tripel
is
one
of
those
beers
that
becomes
more
impressive
with
each
successive
sip
stands
among
the
elites
in
its
style
othis
is
a
nice
tripel
i
like
the
style
to
be
lighter
in
color
which
this
beer
certainly
is
and
although
i
often
go
for
the
sweet
bubblegum
belgian
sugar
bombs
this
brew
managed
to
please
without
going
that
route
that
is
not
to
say
that
it
was
dry
or
hugely
hopped
instead
it
is
just
a
nicely
balanced
slightly
aggressive
tripel
o
my
all
time
favorite
tripel
period
ive
had
a
lot
of
good
ones
but
nothing
puts
on
an
overall
display
like
het
ankers
gouden
carolus
tripel
does
each
time
i
enjoy
it
its
actually
shocking
how
this
brew
brings
excitement
with
every
experience
it
just
keeps
throwing
unprecedented
qualities
at
me
each
time
this
is
a
tripel
i
can
have
any
time
of
year
and
know
i
just
bought
an
enjoyable
belgian
ale
every
time
i
buy
it
this
thing
is
brilliant
and
hands
down
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
highly
recommended
and
something
ill
always
enjoy
o
pretty
good
tripel
not
an
amazing
one
because
it
doesnt
hit
all
my
preferred
style
buttons
the
right
way
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
slight
metallic
finish
and
the
booze
doesnt
quite
have
that
just
concealed
enough
quality
of
the
topflight
tripels
doubt
id
buy
it
again
but
id
never
refuse
a
sample
a
very
citrusy
and
spicy
beer
with
orange
and
pepper
dominating
the
flavor
and
aroma
a
nice
balance
of
all
the
flavors
a
tripel
should
have
orange
pepper
honey
ad
alcohol
a
classic
tripel
well
rounded
with
notes
of
candied
orange
bubble
gum
clove
white
pepper
corriander
tropical
fruit
tangerine
very
versatile
and
a
compliment
to
all
sorts
of
dishes
very
good
stuff
overall
quite
the
scrumptious
tripel
if
you
are
looking
for
something
in
that
style
wit
a
nice
light
fruitiness
and
smooth
finish
then
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
overall
it
doesnt
get
clovey
or
banana
y
like
a
typical
belgian
the
booze
is
noticable
but
well
played
also
ive
had
this
out
of
a
tulip
and
the
companys
chalice
i
prefer
the
companys
method
of
delivery
mf
bright
with
a
medium
body
o
exceptional
this
is
a
well
balanced
triple
with
some
great
sourness
balanced
with
sweetness
o
a
tasty
tripel
and
a
tad
lighter
than
ive
had
lately
which
was
nice
for
a
change
this
one
was
heavy
on
the
citrus
flavour
profile
which
i
really
enjoyed
i
would
certainly
buy
this
one
again
unfortunately
as
is
the
case
with
the
lcbo
these
offerings
dont
last
long
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
to
mediumhigh
intensity
resulting
in
a
slightly
fizzy
prickly
feel
at
first
but
quickly
becoming
very
foamy
smooth
and
creamy
ultimately
as
soft
on
the
palate
as
it
is
in
smell
and
taste
quite
a
nice

overall
i
dont

this
brewer
makes
a
bad

this
is
another
wonderfully
balanced

complex
beer
the

are
great
and
dont
taste
artificial
and
the

nothing
wrong
with
it
and
overall
a
very
good
tripel
though
id
probably
not
get
it
again
for
myself
i
would
recommend
it
though
and
id
probably
buy
a

give
as
a

bring

quite
light
but
nicely

arent

this
is
a

and
fresh
not
bad
at
all
o
descent
beer
not
wild
of
the
peppery
aspects
well
balance
not
very
complex
o
a
classic
tripel
that
stays
totally
true
to
the
style
and
a
great
one
at
that
i
would
ask
no
more
very
nice
balance
and
drinkability
given
the
9abv
o
good
tripel
a
bit
too
biting
for
my
taste
really
warm
which
was
nice
looks
phenomenal
tumbs
up
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
but
the
musty
finish
really
take
a
lot
away
in
my
mind
for
me
tripels
are
always
pretty
hit
and
miss
and
this
one
missed
a
little
for
me
while
not
as
bad
as
some
others
ive
had
it
doesnt
really
shine
above
o
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
that
is
also
quite
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
the
head
is
also
very
impressive
and
deserving
of
having
this
served
in
a
tulip
glass
overall
it
may
be
simply
because
its
the
style
of
ale
i
prefer
but
the
belgians
are
far
and
away
the
worlds
best
brewmasters
another
choice
for
me
to
add
to
my
regular
rotation
d
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
and
a
great
representation
of
what
one
should
be
while
not
the
most
complex
brew
in
the
style
its
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
id
love
to
see
how
some
age
treats
this
one
o
its
a
very
yeasty
beer
overall
and
not
as
dry
like
other
triple
however
its
a
nice
and
pleasant
beer
to
go
with

department
but
this
is
made
up

this

reminds

of

highly
recommended

a
quality
tripel
balanced
with
real
good

a
bit
more
depth
wouldve
been
nice
but
this
was
a
real
good
drink
o
an
american

would
call
this
an

taste
like
an
import
no
mistaking
that
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
not
as
heavy
as

more

imo
i

the

i

this

theres

id

its
an

overall
this
is
a
nicely
true
to
form
tripel
the
aroma
is

and
spicy
as
befits
the
style
but
also
quite
deep
and
complex
a
fine
example
of

with

overall
impression

quite

with
the
mix
of
spicy

and

flavors

medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
and
mediumlight
carbonation
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
fairly
onpoint
for
the
style
though
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
low
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
take
on
a
belgian
tripel
it
is
true
to
style
in
aroma
and
flavor
and
mostly
true
in
mouthfeel
and
is
quite
pleasant
to
drink
its
lower
price
relative
to
imported
and
highend
domestic
tripels
make
up
for
its
few
shortcomings
relative
to
those
higher
priced
examples
a
nice
beer
and
a
shame
its
not
yearround
too
much
coriander
on
the
nose
and
the
tongue
for
my
taste
still
pretty
balanced
and
refreshing
looks
nice
in
the
glass
just
not
my
style
pours
a
nice
golden
hue
about
an
inch
of
a
head
on
it
it
smells
rich
of
fruit
and
the
fruity
undertones
stick
with
you
all
the
way
down
a
very
solid
beer
from
a
solid
company
and
more
than
worth
it
for
the
price
taste
smooth
grainy
soft
rustic
bread
nutty

very

moderate

dry
finish
ive
yet
to
taste
an
american
brewer
either
nail
this
style
or
build
on
it
in
a
unique
way
like
new
belgium
its
just
a
rougher
take
with
more
hop
after
bite
still
worth
a
try
but
their
saison
is
better
because
its
a
more
forgiving
style
the
verdict
good
beer
very
smooth
much
lighter
than
i
expected
highly
drinkable
beautiful
golden
cloudy
beer
nice
spices
easy
pleasant
drink
whatever
it
strengths
and
weaknesses
the
average
out
to
a
really
fine
drinkable
tripel
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
though
there
are
better
easily
available
had
at
pittsburgh
winter
beerfest
overall
its
ok
but
ive
definately
had
better
trippels
from
other
american
brewers
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
but
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
no
aging
this
one
drink
fresh
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
not
up
to
bar
with
the
belgians
and
there
are
better
local
offerings
new
belgium
tripel
theres
nothing
obviously
bad
about
orabelle
its
just
sort
of
middling
overall
while
not
up
there
with
the
best
belgian
tripels
i
thought
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
look
forward
to
its
release
every
year
and
always
buy
a
couple
of
sixers
favorite
every
year
o
nice
beer
good
food
beer
hot
day
you
will
want
something
less
complex
and
not
as
heavy
but
with
a
meal
meats
and
cheese
yes
it
would
do
nicely
the
beer
sipper
i
tend
to
favor
belgium
style
beers
so
i
love
this
one
i
love
the
golden
color
and
the
slightly
sweet
yet
fullflavor
that
this
beer
offers
i
found
it
very
easy
drinking
but
you
do
have
to
be
careful
of
the
8
3
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
i
have
tried
a
few
other
beers
by
great
divide
so
far
they
have
not
let
me
down
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
a
belgian
with
a
slight
fruit
edge
i
did
find
it
quite
drinkable
which
might
be
bad
at
8
3
a
nice
somewhat
subdued
tripel
with
hardly
any
indication
of
it
being
a
big
beer
not
as
sweet
or
sugary
as
many
other
tripelsit
even
tastes
a
bit
drybut
the
mouthfeel
and
creaminess
are
solid
also
not
as
spicy
but
the
flavors
are
still
appealing
with
a
hint
of
peppery
taste
cloudy
color
with
lots
of
head
and
decent
retention
very
drinkable
oa
boring
run
of
the
mill
tripel
that
doesnt
bring
much
to
the
table
my
beer
guru
brought
this
one
over
to
split
much
murkier
than
the
normal
triple
and
the
smell
and
taste
reminded
me
of
a
saison
or
a
wit
enjoyed
the
beer
very
much
i
would
consider
this
a
strong
saison
that
is
really
easy
to
drink
which
gives
it
big
bonus
points
overall
because
of
its
abv
and
drinkability
certainly
would
drink
this
any
day
on
tap
at
lous
food
bar
delicious
by
the
way
hazy
yellow
cloudy
hints
if
belgian
yeast
and
spice
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
yeasty
and
yet
subdued
extremely
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
overall
good
but
not
worthy
of
a
revisit
im
still
not
sure
if
this
is
a
different
recipe
than
the
triple
they
used
to
put
in
bottles
mouthfeel
is
fairly
rich
overall
a
pleasant
drink
just
not
a
top
tripel
overall
orabelle
wasnt
horrible
it
does
have
that
going
for
it
it
doesnt
feel
like
much
of
a
tripel
reading
the
label
is
seemed
more
like
an
amped
up
wit
o
an
alright
american
representation
of
the
style
very
full
of
spicy
yeast
its
a
good
mouthfeel
and
harmonizes
the
flavors
pretty
well
as
mentioned
above
there
is
an
odd
flavor
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
that
is
slightly
offputting
but
does
not
kill
the
beer
i
think
this
beer
would
benefit
from
some
brett
pours
a
cloudy
straw
gold
with
a
shortlasting
white
head
even
though
it
doesnt
hang
around
there
is
still
some
nice
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
everything
you
want
from
a
tripel
citrusy
spicy
and
grainy
theres
a
very
nice
thickness
to
this
ale
with
a
pleasant
silky
feeling
this
is
a
great
belgianstyle
ale
this
is
a
decent
sipping
beer
best
enjoyed
with
a
sharp
tangy
cheese
i
enjoyed
it
while
reading
on
the
front
porch
during
a
cool
midsummer
day
overall
very
drinkable
for
an
8
3
abv
i
need
to
remind
myself
while
i
am
drinking
this
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
definitely
see
myself
purchasing
more
of
it
in
the
springtime
i
can
also
see
this
as
a
great
beer
to
help
out
those
novice
beer
drinker
that
want
to
expand
their
beer
palate
from
blue
moon
and
shock
top
beer
served
on
tap
in
a
goblet
glass
lemon
yellow
color
cloudy
almost
like
a

thin

with
good

is
faint
with
distant
smell
of
citrus
and
hops
taste
is
great
slightly
sweet
complex
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
as
it
is
a
solid
tripel
with
a
wonderful
flavor
profile
this
isnt
an
abbey
triple
but
what
outside
an
abbey
is
this
is
a
good
triple
and
worth
seeking
great
divide
does
a
good
job
with
every
style
they
brew
and
it
shows
in
the
feel
particularly
in
a
wellmade
belgian
this
beer
has
the
depth
a
few
layers
on
the
palate
bright
and
crisp
while
rolling
smoothly
and
imparting
a
softness
without
giving
up
firmness
a
very
very
slight
stickiness
coming
out
in
the
heft
from
the
middle
to
end
is
one
of
very
few
things
but
the
most
notable
keeping
the
score
down
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
belgian
beer
very
enjoyable
after
the
first
sip
this
hazy
golden
belgian
style
ale
serves
up
some
nice

big
white

forms
fine
even

aromatics
are
pleasant
with

by

glad
i
tried
but
cant
afford
to
have
regularly
apart
from
price
though
the
palate
was
a
little
too
mundane
to
catch
my
continued
interest
everything
in
this
little
bottle
was
onpoint
the
nose
the
palate
the
feel
the
overall
impression
but
nothing
ever
jumped
out
as
great
basically
this
isnt
one
for
the
record
books
but
youd
be
hardpressed
to
be
disappointed
in
this
beer
overall
good
to
really
good
beer
pretty
much
in
between
and
though
ive
enjoyed
many
great
divide
beers
i
was
still
surprised
by
this
beer
many
cheaper
tripels
tend
to
be
overwhelmingly
phenolic
while
this
is
smooth
and
based
on
mild
fruit
esters
definitely
worth
a
try
and
something
i
will
buy
again
o
one
of
the
better
bodies
on
a
triple
in
terms
of
carbonation
though
it
could
have
been
better
with
a
bit
more
substance
taste
is
quite
good
definitely
recommended
t
a
unique
and
refreshing
tripel
the
8
3
is
hidden
very
well
which
is
a
nice
quality
overall
great
spring
beer
a
must
try
overall
i
like
the
flavors
and
aroma
of
this
beer
i
do
not
like
its
finish
and
linger
quality
on
the
tongue
the
withefetripel
type
combo
is
interesting
and
tasty
biting
quality
in

does

with
some
time
overall
a
pretty
decent
tripel
could
be
a

crisper

mouthfeel
12

from

has

titan
this

poured
a
pale
cloudy
gold
body
with
minimal
head
and
lace
a
airy
aroma
that
is
light
and
mostly
citrusy
and
yeasty
although
a
touch
of
spice
and
sugariness
seem
to
be
in
there
beer
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
although
it
came
across
as
more
of
a
wit
than
triple
at
times
i
say
this
because
some
of
my
sips
were
dominated
by
both
a
citric
profile
bordering
on
orange
with
possible
lemonzest
and
spices
like
coriander
couple
with
a
sharp
crisp
finish
and
at
times
the
beer
didnt
resemble
a
triple
to
me
that
being
said
there
are
hints
of
sweetness
and
other
tropical
fruits
pineapple
and
it
was
enjoyable
to
sip
on
so
i
could
care
less
of
the
designated
title
for
this
beer
i
tend
to
rate
low
hopefully
consistently
osuper
beer
that
has
many
smells
and
flavors
that
seem
to
blend
well
together
o
do
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
need
to
be
there
probably
not
but
they
dont
hurt
a
little
rough
and
as
far
as
complexity
goes
it
aint
a
rubix
cube
still
it
drinks
easily
and
theres
enough
charm
to
warrant
a
closer
look
the
orabelles
cloudy
golden
orange
color
and
frothy
white
head
gave
off
whiffs
of
orange
peel
belgian
yeast
and
fruitiness
the
taste
was
very
delicate
yet
deceptively
deep
with
a
good
dose
of
belgian
yeast
some
light
fruits
and
a
spiciness
that
was
perfectly
in
the
belgian
tripel
realm
the
light
color
and
subtle
flavors
belittled
its
bold
ambitions
and
held
no
hints
of
booze
or
alcohol
the
orabelle
was
a
very
smooth
and
solid
tripel
overall
an
okay
tripel
overall
an
okay
stab
at
a
great
style
but
not
especially
impressive
overall
easy
to
quaff
this
beer
flavors
are
nice
but
not
overwhelming
worthy
of
a

pretty
decent
belgianinspired
ale
not
quite
in

with
the
style
to
me
but
that
aside
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
has
some
saisonlike
elements
definitely
worth
a
try
cheers
overall
a
solid
beer
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
tripel
and
a
wit
easy
drinking
but
with
a
bang
orabelle
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
tiny
head
the
aroma
has
a
strong
citrus
component
over
spices
and
yeast
the
taste
is
a
bit
odd
i
was
excited
when
i
saw
rye
on
the
label
but
the
rye
here
just
doesnt
work
that
well
with
the
strong
citrus
clashing
and
making
the
middle
to
finish
section
of
the
beer
rather
awkward
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
gently
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
alright
all
things
considered
overall
orabelle
isnt
that
good
a
beer
it
has
promise
but
falls
apart
pretty
quickly

offering

enjoyable
fairly
well
done
tripel
pleasant
flavors
though
nothing
particularly
exciting
about
it
the
carbonation
should
be
upped
a
good
tripel
that
leans
alittle
too
much
into
the
wit
side
for
me
o
overall
you
can
easily
warm
up
to
this
spicy
yeasty
and
fruity
while
the
8

abv
is
easy
to
handle
making
this
go
down
fairly
easy
inticing
another
mouthful
could
be
a
bit
crisper
flavor
is
respectable
and
the
weak
visual
can
be
overlooked
d
a
poor
example
of
the
style
i
expect
more
from
great
divide
takes
a
hit
on
drinkabiity
due
to
the
excessive
alcohol
presence
ill
pass
on
this
in
the
future
overy
very
complex
this
is
one
of
the
better
noses
on
a
beer
ive
personally
ever
reviewed
half
of
the
nose
transitions
into
the
taste
where
i
pick
up
an
array
of
new
flavors
great
divide
does
not
brew
a
subpar
beer
had
on
tap
at
the
corner
slice
here
in
gboro
thursday
night
poured
a
hazy
lemony
yellow
with
a
tinge
of

atop
that
lasted
for
a
good
while
aromas

came
together
pretty
well
with
the
phenols
not
being
over
bearing
lemony
flavors
along
with
white
pepper
spice
up
front
on
the
palate
followed
by
some
toasted
grain
and
a
faint
sharpness
in
the
finish
a
nice
tripel
not
overly
phenolic
and
the
alcohol
is
subduedwell
done
this
is
a
very
spicy
tripel
a
lot
of
rye
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
it
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
overall
this
is
fairly
tasty
and
worth
a
try
i
like
this
and
reminds
me
a
bit
of
golden
monkey
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
one
with
some
sweetness
but
not
overly
so
like
so
many
other
american
versions
can
be
something
i
would
recommend
12oz
bottle
with
freshness

into
a

this
on

with

crusty

and
a
selection

o
a
very

is
a
fine

beer
for
roasted
food
in

o
i
would
love
to
see
more
sixpack
tripels
on
the
market
flavor
and
aroma
wise
this
is
a
really
solid
tripel
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lighter
and
does
linger
on
the
palate
some
pleasant
alcohol
warming
but
overall
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
masked
o
solid
offering
from
great
divide
will
buy
again
4
stars
the
taste
is
of
belgium
not
colorado
its
just
right
yeasty
and
fruity
like
the
aroma
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
a
little
dark
this
isnt
quite
like
some
of
the
belgians
that
will
totally
fool
you
it
is
obvious
this
has
some
kick
i
will
need
to
remember
the
name
this
is
a
good
one
overall
a
pretty
good
american
take
on
a
tripel
good
mix
of
yeast
spices
and
fruit
flavors
well
balanced
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
for
about
ten
bucks
nice
to
see
something
over
8
available
in
a
sixer
typical
cleanlooking
great
divide
label
on
bottle
sillouhette
of
a
girl
aiming
a
bow
and
arrow
im
guessing
some
kind
of
cupidtheme
almost
no
head
after
pouring
into
a
goblet
cloudy
warm
butterscotchyellow
color
is
pleasing
not
sure
if
its
because
i
just
said
butterscotch
but
im
detecting
some
of
that
in
the
nose
candy
and
alcohol
plus
some
yeast
and
maybe
some
light
citrus
the
flavor
is
good
and
i
get
more
of
the
citrus
from
it
orange
for
sure
and
they
do
indicate
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
its
brewed
with
orange
peel
alcohol
taste
is
negligible
mouthfeel
is
thick
nicely
carbonated
and
punchy
plus
sort
of
a
nice
lightly
bitter
finish
to
balance
again
im
going
to
guess
orange
peels
on
that
one
overall
love
this
beer
suprised
to
see
the
lower
score
when
i
signed
in
but
to
each
his
own
overall
a
nice
attempt
from
the
boys
of
denver
but
ill
stick
with
other
favorites
still
a
decent
beer
though
overall
certainly
worth
a
try
as
it
is
very
mellow
and
a
smooth
drinking
beer
good
introduction
for
some
of
the
more
extreme
belgian
tripels
taste
is
strong
and
malty
but
wellbalanced
the
orange
comes
through
well
before
the
double
yeasts
and
coriander
add
a
peppery
note
finishes
with
a
little
booziness
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
fine
and
welldone
tripel
o
this
tripel
has
an
interesting
taste
kind
of
like
a
belgian
beer
meets
a
pilsner
the
malt
flavors
are
very
complex
od
a
good
tripel
abv
isnt
too
high
and
its
not
overly
filling
cant
argue
against
the
price
point
the
dry
graininess
is
a
little
much
for
me
this
is
your
typical
american
attempt
at
the
style
it
doesnt
come
close
to
the
examples
from
overseas
but
its
still
an
alright
beer
for
what
it
is
overall
really
good
but
not
as
big
and
bold
as
alot
of
other
tripels
would
be
a
great
starter
tripel
or
for
someone
that
cant
handle
the
big
flavors
that
a
la
fin
du
monde
would
provide
solid
and
very
easy
to
drink
nice
rich
yellow
color
small
head
but
it
does
leave
some
lacing
smell
is
good
yeast
coriander
fruity
rye
good
flavor
and
very
easy
to
drink
for
8
a
bit
heavier
and
maltier
than
a
whit
but
similar
in
flavor
full
plush
mouthfeel
complex
malt
profile
spicy
bite
finish
very
enjoyable
first
triple
ive
really
liked
a
pretty
good
craft
tripel
that
ill
have
to
try
again
but
not
tonight
overall
not
something
i
would
get
all
the
time
especially
at
3
dollars
a
pop
but
a
very
smooth
drinking
triple
kind
of
disappointed
going
in
i
expected
an
golden
pale
ale
but
its
still
a
great
beer
the
spicing
is
not
over
the
top
but
it
is
easily
the
most
dominant
combo
of
flavors
and
gives
it
a
sweetness
that
the
beer
could
have
gotten
by
easily
without
it
tastes
more
like
an
imperial
wit
than
a
tripel
with
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
fine
carbonation
feels
great
i
just
dont
like
it
when
the
spice
additions
overpower
the
light
grainy
malt
and
belgian
yeast
in
a
tripel
this
one
does
it
and
it
is
definitely
not
subtle
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
one
again
would
rather
grab
a
golden
monkey
if
in
the
market
for
a
10
six
pack
tripel
o
a
nice
beer
havent
had
many
in
this
style
but
this
is
a
good
drinker
nice
and
refreshing
and
hides
the
moderate
abv
well
great
spring
seasonal
recommended
but
i
think
gd
could
blend
this
one
out
better
im
anxious
to
see
if
it
changes
next
spring
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
wasnt
a
world
class
tripel
but
it
held
its
own
the
fruity
esters
played
the
biggest
role
the
yeast
was
noticeable
with
its
spiciness
as
well
my
biggest
complaint
with
this
one
was
the
mouthfeel
i
thought
it
could
have
been
a
bit
fuller
i
did
however
think
the
crispness
stood
up
to
the
alcohol
quite
well
this
is
one
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
orabelle
from
great
divide
pours
a
very
light
cloudy
straw
yellow
the
smellhas
a
very
light
citrus
with
a
little
touch
of
spices
but
over
all
the
smell
is
very
weak
the
taste
is
just
the
opposite
its
very
full
after
such
a
weak
smell
i
was
surprised
at
how
flavorful
this
beer
is
this
is
a
really
good
play
on
the
belgian
style
you
can
really
taste
the
orange
and
the
coriander
i
hate
to
bring
up
bluemoon
here
but
if
you
like
bluemoon
you
should
really
try
this
and
see
how
a
real
craft
brewery
does
the
orange
coriander
thing
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
with
this
flavor
combo
o
orabelle
is
a
pretty
tasty
easy
to
like
beer
definitely
drinkable
inviting
beer
terrific
aroma
complex
and
bright
but
really
doesnt
do
well
after
astringent
finish
and
lack
of
substantial
carbonation
really
make
this
beer
sluggish
good
attempt
i
dont
know
if
they
have
the
right
yeast
to
pull
this
one
off
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
as
great
divide
is
usually
solid
leave
it
on
the
shelf
overall
a
nice
belgianstyle
beer
but
with
weak
head
and
a
style
that
is
at
most
midway
between
a
belgian
white
and
belgian
tripel
this
worked
out
to
be
an
easy
drinking
tripel
not
as
good
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
ok
flavors
but
every
thing
seemed
dull
the
very
low
carbonation
didnt
help
either
hades
was
the
last
belgian
style
that
this
brewery
did
well
i
was
going
to
quick
review
this
but
i
cant
poured
12oz
into
goose
island
belgian
chalice
this
beer
pours
golden
yellow
hazy
small
white
head
the
smell
is
divine
banana
belgian
yeast
orange
coriander
hint
of
vanilla
tastes
as
good
as
it
smells
very
refreshing
belgian
yeast
sweet
orange
and
coriander
some
lemon
and
the
texture
is
almost
silky
its
like
a
more
flavorful
hefe
this
beer
is
very
very
good
glad
to
see
it
on
ohio
shelves
overall
its
kind
of
a
weird
and
distinct
one
but
its
still
pretty
solid
and
quite
unique
for
a
tripel
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
light
yellowish
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
mild
aroma
of
sweet
malt
belgian
spicing
particularly
coriander
light
stone
fruit
flavor
of
stone
fruit
belgian
yeast
coriander
clove
sweet
malt
medium
body
with
some
creaminess
good
mouth
feel
flavors
are
a
bit
subdued
for
a
tripel
but
the
flavor
profile
hits
the
style
quite
nicely
a
pleasant
domestic
tripel
o
superb
i
always
forget
how
amazing
great
divide
is
overall
really
good
american
interpretation
on
a
belgian
style
tripel
great
divide
doesnt
get
the
same
level
of
hype
as
some
other
craft
breweries
but
ive
yet
to
have
a
beer
from
them
that
disappoints
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
the
label
claims
this
is
a
tripel
but
theyve
gone
a
lot
further
into
witbier
territory
than
i
like
to
have
in
a
tripel
overall
a
lot
of
hop
punks
and
beli
snobs
rated
this
beer
way
to
low
i
drinkand
rate
as
my
fav
bev
a
french
canadian
tripel
all
the
time
and
this
one
is
so
close
to
it
great
divide
listen
to
my
praises
and
keep
making
this
beer
i
love
it
o
good
but
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
body
in
this
beer
given
the
different
grains
listed
in
it
wheat
rye
oats
wonder
what
would
have
happened
if
a
less
efficient
yeast
went
to
work
on
this
or
if
i
drank
it
a
bit
younger
if
it
tasted
more
like
it
smelled
this
would
be
a
goto
o
this
is
about
what
i
expected
it
to
be
very
good
but
not
amazing
rather
nice
solid
sample
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
citrus
fruit
spices
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slightly
tart
citrus
fruit
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
quite
tasty
and
a
solid
american
take
on
the
style
a
note
about
the
carbonation
i
tried
multiple
bottles
and
experienced
the
same
underwhelming
carbonation
with
each
bottle
from
the
same
sixpack
the
lack
of
carbonation
doesnt
kill
this
beer
but
it
does
drag
down
the
score
a
bit
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
its
more
of
a
wit
then
it
is
a
tripel
though
i
suppose
the
two
arent
too
different
but
its
still
very
tasty
slightly
foggy
golden
yellow
color
covered
by
a
slim
layer
of
milky
suds
spicy
fruity
aroma
coriander
orange
peel
banana
clove
flowers
and
mild
dough
big
fruity
esters
burst
forth
in
the
mouth
peppery
phenols
citrus
zest
some
tart
acidity
coriander
spice
and
a
tangyness
that
i
assume
comes
from
the
wheat
only
a
little
grain
near
the
end
but
all
the
bright
yeasty
spicy
flavors
overwhelm
any
malt
and
i
really
like
to
have
some
noticeable
pale
malt
in
my
tripels
to
soften
and
balance
things
out
the
finish
is
sweet
but
nondescript
medium
bodied
and
low
on
carbonation
which
hurts
the
drinkability
though
a
pleasant
dryness
helps
not
bad
far
from
the
best
another
really
good
belgianstyle
brew
from
great
divide
they
make
so
many
good
beers
that
dont
involve
bales
of
hops
from
the
12
oz
bottle
brought
to
me
from
denver
label
says
bottled
on
dec
12
2012
decent
tripel
style
but
aside
from
the
belgian
yeti
and
maybe
hades
i
dont
care
for
great
divides
forays
into
belgians
this
one
pours
more
clear
than
expected
but
still
with
some
suspended
yeast
bright
golden
in
color
more
of
a
sexy
blonde
actually
a
ton
of
bubbles
build
a
tall
white
head
i
smell
corriander
and
some
bready
floral
yeast
like
some
kind
of
fruit
muffin
theres
some
peppery
element
as
well
more
complex
than
i
thought
itd
be
and
less
frilly
than
new
belgiums
tripel
flavor
is
yeast
driven
without
much
citrus
happening
at
all
its
quite
refreshing
and
its
alcohol
content
is
expertly
disguised
erratic
carbonation
like
a
sodapop
but
a
quick
finish
feels
like
carbonated
water
light
body
for
a
bigger
brew
alcohol
wise
appropriate
from
early
spring
not
the
best
thing
great
divide
has
done
but
i
like
it
a
whole
lot
better
than
that
saison
they
did
last
year
they
had
a
tripel
in
bombers
last
year
and
it
was
pretty
good
but
a
little
pricey
this
is
even
better
and
at
a
very
reasonable
price
ill
definately
be
back
for
more
o
a
well
made
american
tripel
the
flavours
are
good
the
mouthfeel
could
use
a
little
work
but
its
a
minor
quibble
all
and
all
i
enjoyed
this
effort
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
like
the
spice
it
is
not
over
powering
i
can
have
a
few
of
these
i
still
like
great
divides
stronger
darker
offering
much
better
rumbleipa
o
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
extremely
easy
drinking
for
8
3
but
it
is
not
lacking
taste
either
one
of
the
best
triples
iv
tried
finally
a
begian
style
tripel
that
does
not
break
the
bank
i
have
a
bottle
of
la
trappe
in
the
fridge
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
but
that
set
me
back
12
for
a
bomber
which
is
6
for
a
glass
of
beer
great
for
a
special
event
but
where
is
the
common
mans
tripel
dry
dock
brews
a
good
one
but
it
is
still
6
for
a
bomber
and
not
always
available
new
belgium
comes
close
with
their
trippel
but
it
has
a
bit
much
coriander
for
my
taste
so
i
jumped
at
the
chance
to
try
the
great
divide
orabelle
when
i
saw
the
six
pack
in
the
beer
cooler
for
10
the
color
is
a
cloudy
peach
with
a
thin
head
and
little
carbonation
belgian
yeast
and
bready
sweetness
come
through
the
aroma
so
far
so
good
the
flavor
is
big
on
apricot
with
a
touch
of
honey
very
light
pepper
touches
the
finish
to
make
for
an
outstanding
belgian
style
tripel
thank
you
great
divide
the
great
divide
colette
is
worth
a
try
as
well
a
tripel
brewed
with
barley
wheat
oats
and
rye
along
with
the
other
accoutrements
of
the
style
right
on
it
pours
a
hazy
sunflower
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
orange
zest
mango
belgian
yeast
light
black
pepper
and
light
cracked
wheat
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemon
zest
belgian
yeast
banana
clove
light
black
pepper
and
light
coriander
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
grainy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
one
that
showcases
a
bit
more
in
the
way
of
fruitiness
than
spiciness
and
somehow
makes
it
work
this
has
got
to
be
the
first
beer
from
tallgrass
that
i
genuinely
dont
enjoy
o
probably
not
a
great
triple
but
i
like
it
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
nothing
offensive
at
all
like
the
brewery
description
says
id
like
to
do
it
next
time
from
a
champagne
flute
an
americanized
tripel
to
be
sure
i
recommend
drinking
this
fresh
it
seems
that
age
has
not
done
it
any
favors
i
certainly
wouldnt
reach
for
this
over
a
belgian
tripel
or
even
over
allagashs
version
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
overall
a
little
hoppy
but
in
general
a
very
satisfying
tripel
o
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
maybe
not
a
classic
belgian
trippel
but
a
very
good
american
version
will
have
to
grab
a
few
more
of
these
next
time
im
through
the
midwest
light
golden
hued
with
great
clarity
a
quarter
inch
of
off
white
foam
rests
on
top
and
there
is
light
brussels
lacing
i
smell
faint
light
malt
and
belgian
candy
sugar
theres
a
sweetness
of
light
malt
and
belgian
candy
sugar
in
the
flavor
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
dry
the
sweetness
in
the
flavor
is
slightly
cloying
i
have
to
give
this
one
a
few
points
for
can
graphics
ontap
at
bernies
in
waukesha
wi
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
yeasty
banana
the
taste
is
light
and
smooth
no
big
bold
yeast
and
carbonation
here
smooth
and
delicious
like
everything
from
tall
grass
o
great
base
materials
are
somewhat
hidden
by
missteps
but
it
is
still
appreciable
as
a
great
belgianstyle
tripel
from
kansas
of
all
places
highly
refreshing
original
and
wonderfully
hides
the
high
abv
the
prominent
yeastiness
is
good
in
the
nose
but
murks
the
palate
somewhat
but
not
enough
to
dissuade
me
from
buying
a
tall
fourpack
of
this
handsome
rooster
again
as
for
the
beer
part
of
this
review
it
definitely
does
fill
the
description
you
see
on
their
website
its
champagnelike
and
you
can
taste
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
in
this
one
but
not
overpowering
has
some
saison
features
which
i
personally
like
but
not
everyone
else
may
feel
the
same
almost
as
if
this
is
a
part
french
beer
instead
of
just
belgian
tripel
some
citrus
sweet
candy
notes
along
with
the
overall
champagne
quite
unique
not
amazing
but
very
good
this
beers
alcohol
content
makes
you
feel
really
good
and
relaxed
unlike
a
maiboch
which
gives
you
a
headache
o
decent
beer
the
bitterness
takes
over
after
a
few
sips
and
the
roasted
flavors
and
sugars
disappear
rather
quickly
leaving
you
with
a
bitter
taste
that
lingers
for
a
long
time
probably
would
pair
well
with
a
sweet
chicken
dish
like
a
marsala
something
to
offset
the
bitter
that
just
hangs
most
ipas
have
a
bitter
that
lingers
but
there
are
discernable
characteristics
of
the
lingering
bitter
this
just
well
is
not
a
session
beer
due
to
8
5abv
a
few
of
these
and
youre
right
as
rain
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
the
floral
finish
sets
it
apart
in
the
style
o
overall
this
was
just
an
okay
tripel
at
best
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
pretty
solid
the
amount
of
biscuit
here
though
just
kills
this
o
a
good
interpretation
of
a
tripel
slightly
off
beat
and
pushing
the
envelop
velvet
rooster
is
a
solid
beer
maybe
not
a
solid
or
great
tripel
by
the
belgian
standard
but
i
would
have
it
again
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
tallgrass
offering
so
far
o
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
deceiving
as
it
tricks
you
into
thinking
great
things
lie
ahead
in
the
end
its
just
your
standard
tripel
16oz
can
pours
hazygolden
with
a
bubbly
white
head
good
retention
and
lace
aromas
are
yeast
fruit
banana
spice
biscuit
tastes
are
bready
spicy
yeast
biscuit
banana
orange
grass
and
more
boozy
as
it
warms
mediumfullish
body
with
a
dry
but
fairly
clean
finish
overall
not
a
bad
tripel
but
without
a
wow
factor
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
topnotch
belgian
brewed
tripels
love
the
style
love
this
take
on
it
and
really
love
that
i
am
enjoying
a
quality
tripel
in
a
can
brewed
in
kansas
id
have
this
one
in
my
regular
rotation
if
i
could
get
it
locally
or
if
i
lived
in
kansas
o
not
bad
def
not
my
favorite
beer
i
would
only
buy
this
if
someone
else
i
know
liked
it
it
is
a
once
in
a
while
beer
for
me
for
a
belgian
triple
style
i
have
very
high
expectations
this
just
doesnt
meet
what
i
have
come
to
expect
however
pretty
good
for
american
interpretation
o
velvet
rooster
is
a
fine
belgian
style
tripel
that
showcases
what
yeast
can
really
add
to
a
beer
spice
sweetness
and
earthy
hops
all
blend
well
with
a
kiss
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
for
a
delectable
brew
oa
great
tripel
and
it
comes
in
a
can
its
a
simple
brew
but
sometimes
simple
is
just
what
you
need
the
feel
is
clean
and
refreshing
just
as
the
name
says
it
is
velvety
smooth
but
with
a
kick
smell
some
florals
but
the
taste
is
what
really
got
me
light
fruits
that
give
it
a
nice
candied
sweetness
delicious
belgian
yeast
and
some
warm
spice
this
was
delicious
and
will
soon
become
a
4
pack
purchase
this
is
a
pretty
nice
american
example
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
the
fruity
and
floral
notes
accompanying
the
nose
and
flavor
as
well
as
the
fresh
finish
final
thoughts
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
an
american
craft
brewery
taking
on
such
a
highly
acclaimed
belgian
style
but
im
definitely
impressed
usually
tripels
have
a
yeasty
flavor
that
ruins
part
of
the
experience
for
me
but
velvet
roosters
clean
taste
is
exactly
what
ive
been
looking
for
in
this
style
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
special
thanks
to
bulbman
for
sending
this
one
over
this
beer
poured
out
as
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
were
pretty
good
on
this
one
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
with
some
bready
wheat
and
spice
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
with
some
soft
fruity
notes
as
hints
of
spice
and
more
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
overall
its
a
really
nice
beer
not
the
best
tripel
out
there
but
still
worth
trying
this
is
an
overall
satisfying
beerthat
says
a
lot
d
a
pretty
solid
sessionable
tripel
from
an
american
brewery
wouldnt
hate
it
if
more
american
breweries
could
make
tripels
like
this
one
tasty
o
as
good
a
tripel
as
ive
ever
tried
from
a
can
ok
so
this
is
my
first
and
a
worthy
example
if
tallgrass
cans
were
available
in
our
area
id
seek
these
out
as
such
ill
look
again
next
time
im
in
the
midwest
mouthfeel
is
perfect
out
of
a
can
even
cant
wait
to
try
this
on
tap
o
nice
aroma
profile
but
never
really
jumping
out
of
my
glass
flavor
was
quite
complex
like
a
good
tripel
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
stayed
a
little
lighter
on
my
palate
d
the
sweetness
and
over
ripe
fruits
of
this
one
make
it
a
little
too
much
for
me
the
aroma
is
overly
polite
seeming
to
hold
back
certain
depths
of
fruit
and
grass
and
freshbaked
dinner
roll
the
flavor
in
the
mouth
is
plenty
upfront
showing
the
way
to
a
wonderland
of
hop
brightness
tempered
by
sweet
malt
and
expanded
by
a
diaphanous
barnyard
funk
o
this
beer
definitely
tastes
strong
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
its
not
a
bad
tripel
considering
it
came
from
a
can
overall
a
tasty
tripel
and
a
sneaky
amount
of
alcohol
that
can
get
you
but
a
really
tasty
beer
here
o
certainly
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
belgian
styled
tripels
from
a
can
before
if
ever
but
this
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
if
tallgrass
was
available
where
i
lived
i
could
see
this
being
a
great
tailgating
beer
during
football
season
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
and
the
fairly
high
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
drinkability
tommy
likey
tommy
want
rooster
wingy
this
is
the
best
tallgrass
offering
i
have
had
so
far
and
probably
the
de
facto
best
beer
i
have
had
from
kansas
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
tripel
because
im
not
a
big
fan
of
them
and
im
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
tallgrass
im
impressed
with
velvet
rooster
and
will
be
seeking
it
out
again
overall
i
dont
mind
this
i
am
sort
of
really
just
above
borderline
its
very
unique
and
interesting
but
its
also
missing
lots
of
things
i
like
in
this
style
particularly
a
sense
of
richness
and
sweetness
but
not
too
sweet
i
could
have
this
again
but
dont
desire
to
o
a
nice
surprise
coming
from
a
can
trippel
meets
farmhouse
ale
even
smoother
as
it
warms
cock
a
doddle
doo
would
drink
more
not
great
but
not
my
favorite
sr
enjoyable
and
available
without
a
bottle
opener
everything
you
want
for
a
summer
afternoon
golf
game
thanks
to
thebishopco
for
this
one
overall
a
solid
american
take
on
a
tripel
could
of
been
stronger
in
the
spices
but
it
avoids
the
overly
sweet
flavor
that
some
american
belgian
style
beers
have
m
the
ale
lives
up
to
its
name
the
velvet
part
not
the
rooster
thankfully
tingly
carbonation
but
i
could
do
with
a
little
bit
more
also
not
as
dry
as
some
tripels
i
have
had
which
makes
this
one
a
bit
more
syrupy
than
i
prefer
for
a
belgian
ale
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
initially
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
behind
the
residual
sweetness
but
as
the
brew
comes
up
to
temperature
the
candy
quality
becomes
almost
cloying
and
the
alcohol
evolves
and
starts
to
clash
i
am
appreciative
of
the
chance
to
try
this
brew
but
honestly
dont
think
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
this
can
is
another
masterpiece
in
the
world
of
graphic
design
by
the
tallgrass
brewery
poured
into
nb
globe
glass
appearance
is
a
hazy
yellow
with
generous
mounds
of
white
head
tons
of
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
full
of
ripe
bananas
spicy
cloves
and
notes
of
bready
yeast
the
nose
is
right
on
for
the
style
the
taste
features
waves
of
lemon
zest
banana
clove
and
bread
lots
of
belgo
flavors
workin
in
this
brew
the
body
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
beer
provides
a
great
value
for
a
flavorful
and
authentic
tasting
tripel
definitely
worth
a
try
if
not
for
anything
more
than
having
these
artistic
cans
around
for
display
more
grain
and
sweet
bread
come
out
in
the
flavor
almost
like
a
pound
cake
slathered
with
peanut
butter
hops
do
a
good
job
of
adding
some
bite
on
the
back
end
along
with
a
rather
unique
alcohol
presence
body
is
right
at
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
so
fine
it
is
easy
to
overlook
little
bit
of
earthy
grain
as
it
warms
almost
like
some
maris
otter
malt
is
used
pretty
good
for
an
american
brewed
tripel
and
i
will
surely
purchase
a
fourpack
next
time
i
find
myself
heading
to
arrowhead
to
soak
in
a
chiefs
game
would
be
a
dangerous
tailgate
companion
this
psychedelic
rooster
o
not
bad
falls
a
little
short
on
the
nose
and
the
finish
is
not
too
pleasant
drinkability
suffers
because
of
the
latter
mouthfeel
was
not
anything
special
poured
a
pale
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
receded
to
a
wispy
layer
of
bubbles
aroma
of
bready
yeast
grass
grape
and
apple
skins
flavor
was
a
bit
stale
but
not
to
the
point
where
i
could
call
this
a
bad
beer
toasted
bread
yeast
grass
and
wood
more
green
apple
skin
very
earthy
in
the
finish
lightmedium
body
pretty
drying
higher
alcohol
not
very
noticeable
overall
a
decent
quaff
though
nothing
unique
or
amazing
going
on
overall
i
find
it
pretty
good
but
the
taste
is
lacking
complexity
and
nuance
its
pretty
bland
and
dominated
by
vegetabley
lightlybitter
hops
fantastic
yeast
in
the
smell
but
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
taste
the
sweetness
of
this
one
makes
it
perfect
every
season
a
heavy
beer
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
very
tasty
and
great
looking
well
cockadoodledoo
this
rooster
has
soul
i
can
dig
it
i
like
that
tallgrass
is
putting
out
a
great
new
beer
that
is
unique
and
is
in
a
can
long
live
the
can
solid
taste
good
looking
pour
i
will
keep
this
one
around
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
an
inch
and
a
half
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
minimal
lacing
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
of
mandarin
oranges
passion
fruit
and
leather
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
has
of
interesting
aspects
but
still
seems
to
lack
the
kind
of
complexity
i
look
for
in
a
tripel
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
with
so
many
better
examples
of
the
style
easily
available
i
cant
see
myself
purchasing
this
beer
again
o
tallgrass
has
a
very
solid
tripel
in
their
roster
with
velvet
rooster
while
it
isnt
exactly
a
standout
this
beer
will
hold
its
own
in
the
category
especially
for
an
american
brewery
o
overall
this
was
a
great
canned
beer
however
for
the
style
it
really
misses
the
mark
doesnt
come
across
as
a
true
triple
a
tasty
brew
none
the
less
glad
i
gave
this
a
try
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
hides
the
alcohol
insanely
well
nice
body
and
flavor
mildly
bready
sweet
decent
finish
not
too
dry
not
wonderful
but
a
very
decent
tripel
i
might
have
it
again
this
is
one
nice
looking
triple
it
rivals
the
look
of
some
belgians
ive
seen
straw
goldorange
appearance
a
nice
full
white
pillowy
head
that
retains
and
sticks
smell
is
of
faint
ripe
fruit
apple
pear
faint
grape
bubblegum
taste
i
get
candi
sugar
apple
pear
bubblegum
and
nice
belgian
yeast
feel
is
great
lively
with
active
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
one
of
the
better
american
belgian
triples
ive
had
recently
because
its
not
blogged
down
with
to
many
hops
great
beer
well
made
and
nicely
balanced
this
tripel
is
a
little
ordinary
lots
of
citrus
orange
up
front
with
grapefruit
in
the
back
a
subtle
belgian
breadiness
hints
of
biscuit
and
faint
cloves
there
isnt
a
strong
unique
character
or
unique
flavor
profile
to
the
brew
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
without
being
offensive
or
extraordinary
though
not
category
for
which
points
are
awarded
velvet
rooster
is
one
of
the
most
creative
beer
titles
i
have
seen
props
to
tallgrass
for
the
originality
o
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
very
good
in
all
honestly
it
reminds
me
more
of
an
adjunct
lager
than
an
belgian
triple
i
was
looking
forward
to
opening
this
can
and
was
let
down
quite
a
bit
i
suppose
it
has
all
the
right
flavors
but
the
balance
of
those
flavors
is
way
off
from
where
it
should
be
tastes
okay
but
not
much
like
a
tripel
bit
of
traditional
overripe
fruit
up
front
along
with
nodes
of
mint
this
moves
into
a
spiciness
that
tastes
somehow
ersatz
and
followed
up
by
a
strange
graininess
that
would
be
more
at
home
in
an
all
malt
lager
things
come
together
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
smooth
and
caramely
but
the
back
end
just
does
not
resemble
a
tripel
at
all
blonde
with
bleached
highlights
when
backlit
and
a
creamy
ivory
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
sweet
with
fresh
grainy
notes
in
the
nose
big
and
flavorful
tastes
like
a
brewery
wet
grain
and
raw
fresh
hops
with
a
bit
of
belgian
yeastiness
and
a
powerful
spice
kick
coriander
of
course
and
white
pepper
dry
and
yeasty
in
the
finish
with
an
american
hoppy
finish
full
bodied
and
smoothly
carbonated
finishes
mostly
dry
a
tasty
brew
from
tallgrass
d
this
was
actually
pretty
good
theres
more
sweetness
and
less
belgian
yeast
character
than
id
prefer
from
this
style
but
its
definitely
in
my
top
5
canned
belgianstyle
beers
particularly
those
from
kansas
a
tripel
in
a
can
big
time
this
is
not
a
perfect
tripel
by
any
means
but
its
very
interesting
and
its
in
a
can
lots
of
floral
and
herbal
flavors
going
on
its
pretty
sweet
but
the
herbs
and
black
pepper
help
even
it
out
give
it
a
go
hazed
gold
with
an
orange
glow
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
dense
white
head
of
foam
grain
husk
medicinal
phenolics
sublte
banana
and
cherry
alcohol
definitely
speaks
up
at
the
end
of
each
sip
a
bit
too
sweet
but
certainly
not
cloying
this
one
needs
a
bit
more
yeast
character
and
more
dryness
but
why
the
hell
am
i
complaining
a
canned
belgianstyle
tripel
brewed
in
kansas
god
damned
the
american
craft
beer
scene
is
awesome
and
oh
yeah
the
can
is
pretty
damn
awesome
too
o
a
pretty
average
tripel
the
dms
presence
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
really
hold
it
back
o
like
i
said
not
their
best
work
or
the
best
of
the
tripels
but
it
had
a
good
cloak
for
the
abv
and
didnt
put
you
off
in
its
thickness
the
body
is
pretty
slick
for
a
tripel
the
trademark
belgian
effervescence
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
its
place
is
an
amount
of
carbonation
that
simultaneously
livens
up
the
beer
and
lets
you
forget
about
it
real
quick
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
below
average
for
the
style
itd
maybe
be
worth
trying
one
of
these
tallgrass
is
a
brewery
that
i
like
but
this
is
perhaps
their
poorest
widerelease
beer
o
this
is
my
favorite
offering
to
date
from
tall
grass
the
mouthfeel
is
good
creamy
appropriate
carbonation
not
a
bad
trippel
not
a
great
one
either
a
good
beer
but
just
ok
for
its
style
o
this
is
a
really
nice
trippelso
creamy
yeasty
bready
slightly
funky
mmmm
very
dry
and
nice
carbonation
a
great
beer
no
sense
of
alcohol
easy
to
love
hard
to
hate
wow
second
taste
of
tallgrass
offerings
and
already
im
wondering
what
else
im
missing
picked
up
a
fresh
four
pack
of
tallboy
cans
from
midtown
liquors
in
tulsa
ok
what
a
great
shop
pours
out
a
deeper
orangetinted
golden
hue
with
a
medium
amount
of
clouded
haze
with
a
nice
fluffy
cap
of
bubblebath
foam
on
top
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
but
looks
pretty
for
the
short
time
that
it
lasts
texture
is
sort
of
thick
and
slightly
undercarbonated
for
my
taste
in
the
style
smells
like
an
overripe
mushy
pear
that
has
been
dipped
in
cereal
grains
and
than
sprinkled
thoroughly
with
green
cardamom
gains
an
unwanted
slight
metallic
tinge
when
allowed
to
warm
up
all
the
way
to
room
temperature
has
all
the
fruity
esterfied
grapes
pears
plums
flavor
of
a
belgianstyled
ale
that
you
would
expect
as
well
as
a
nice
dose
of
spiced
cloves
on
top
and
the
abv
is
hard
to
detect
if
only
it
didnt
gain
that
weird
metallic
tinge
when
it
warmed
up
and
had
a
better
texture
i
would
have
been
a
real
fan
of
this
one
overall
a
good
tripel
that
leans
heavily
to
the
spicy
side
of
the
spectrum
not
especially
balanced
or
nuanced
in
taste
the
addition
of
a
little
sweetness
and
fruit
would
go
a
long
way
here
try
it
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
drinkable
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
what
i
think
of
as
a
tripel
the
crack
glug
proved
that
i
am
slightly
out
of
touch
as
i
got
some
overflow
as
the
big
thick
eggnogcolored
head
roared
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
over
the
rim
of
my
glass
its
retention
was
actually
becoming
a
problem
as
it
seemed
to
refuse
to
drop
hindering
me
from
pouring
what
still
remained
in
the
can
color
was
a
slightlyhazy
deep
goldenyellow
nose
had
a
papery
mustiness
undoubtedly
yeastdriven
like
newspapers
out
of
the
attic
or
basement
wow
i
was
really
anxious
for
the
first
sip
once
the
head
got
under
control
mouthfeel
was
quite
full
very
viscous
as
i
rolled
it
around
on
my
tongue
taking
in
the
melding
of
flavors
that
included
tropical
fruit
think
mango
banana
coconut
and
cracked
black
pepper
as
well
as
an
underlying
mustiness
to
say
that
the
finish
was
dry
would
be
to
mark
me
as
uttering
the
understatement
of
the
year
the
zephyr
winds
of
the
sahara
desert
blew
through
the
back
of
my
throat
on
the
finish
dry
arid
zounds
the
spiciness
just
lingered
in
my
mouth
and
i
marveled
that
this
had
come
out
of
a
can
a
kansas
can
no
less
i
would
absolutely
have
some
of
this
in
the
cooler
on
hula
in
the
coola
day
01
february
annually
but
it
might
be
a
bit
much
for
the
beach
a
nicely
done
trippel
that
stands
up
the
the
belgian
offerings
not
saying
it
is
as
good
but
stands
up
to
the
style
well
i
love
the
design
on
the
can
very
artsy
o
a
decent
beer
expected
a
little
more
based
on
the
reviews
but
i
wouldnt
put
this
in
my
10
favorite
tripels
a
fairly
approachable
drinkable
selection
for
someone
who
isnt
into
trappist
beers
but
the
yeasty
fruity
grainy
flavor
is
subdued
and
the
body
is
a
little
awkward
just
ok
overall
despite
some
minor
issues
with
the
hoppy
yet
not
dry
finish
this
is
a
strong
usmade
tripel
especially
at
the
price
point
and
it
comes
in
a
pint
can
a
delicious
tripel
by
the
folks
at
tallgrass
and
in
a
can
for
those
who
want
a
taste
of
belgiumonthego
picked
up
a
4
pack
of
this
new
canned
tripel
i
used
to
be
big
into
tripels
and
tried
this
one
beside
sprechers
tripel
tallgrass
won
that
competition
but
isnt
really
outstanding
compared
to
other
trips
ive
had
but
its
a
nicely
rounded
and
flavorful
beer
woodychandler
continues
to
amaze
me
with
his
variety
of
canned
beers
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
and
yeast
taste
is
also
big
on
yeast
some
fruits
and
spices
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
high
quality
beer
like
it
very
much
so
o
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
tallgrass
keeps
doing
amazing
beers
on
tap
at
the
pig
fiddle
in
edina
had
this
next
to
a
friend
that
was
enjoying
the
st
feuillien
tripel
this
is
an
admirable
take
on
the
style
but
cant
quite
stand
up
to
the
belgian
counterpart
the
aroma
is
a
little
too
messy
and
spicy
like
a
farmhouse
ale
theres
a
light
crisp
lemon
note
but
this
beer
is
on
the
earthy
side
the
body
is
appropriately
crisp
but
the
yeast
character
sends
this
into
the
realm
of
saisons
a
tripel
in
a
can
is
nice
still
have
to
deliver
in
the
flavor
department
and
it
fell
just
a
little
short
compared
to
the
belgian
greats
very
solid
brew
from
tallgrass
brewery
almost
like
a
sibling
of
our
excellent
surly
brewery
up
here
in
minnesota
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
earned
a
spot
in
my
regular
rotation
i
found
my
self
grabbing
the
second
can
before
the
first
was
gone
and
if
discretion
hadnt
prevailed
a
third
would
have
been
welcomed
as
well
absolutely
delicious
dont
think
twice
about
grabbing
a
fourpack
if
this
were
sold
in
ccd
750s
im
sure
id
be
buying
this
beer
regularly
at
10
bucks
a
bottle
as
it
is
its
an
awesome
bargain
and
one
i
wont
be
passing
up
often
o
a
great
tripel
in
a
can
or
really
just
a
great
tripel
easily
could
have
a
couple
pints
this
one
will
be
in
my
fridge
on
the
rotaation
taste
clean
supple
and
smooth
on
the
palate
and
down
the
throat
fine
and
fruity
with
light
spice
tickly
and
prickly
some
softshoe
on
the
tongue
a
little
buck
and
wing
and
its
all
deliciousness
down
the
hatch
after
that
creamy
and
smooth
and
as
we
so
often
say
dangerously
drinkable
proceed
with
caution
too
tasty
to
stop
at
one
too
fierce
to
go
beyond
two
pillowy
white
head
sits
atop
a
regal
gold
body
of
nectoar
lacing
is
very
full
aroma
is
bready
and
lemony
a
little
spice
and
hay
flavor
is
a
little
sourdough
some
lemongrass
cakey
yeastiness
pepper
really
nice
i
expect
nothing
less
from
this
fine
brewery
highly
drinkable
and
flavorful
light
medium
body
with
a
soft
feel
to
it
and
alcohol
presence
is
barely
detectable
a
winner
there
is
some
hype
surrounding
this
beer
not
sure
if
its
because
its
the
first
canned
tripel
but
i
think
this
beer
is
worthy
of
some
hype
because
of
the
product
inside
i
find
this
one
very
enjoyable
with
a
pretty
high
drinkability
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
sort
of
feels
like
a
working
mans
tripel
it
is
nice
and
sweet
and
has
the
flavors
of
a
belgianbrewed
tripel
without
the
pricetag
or
the
sometimes
annoyingly
high
carbonation
i
bet
the
absence
of
canconditioning
helps
with
the
creamy
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
compared
to
the
prickly
mouthfeel
of
other
belgian
style
tripels
overall
absolutely
incredible
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
when
i
heard
tallgrass
was
canning
a
belgianstyle
tripel
this
was
a
pretty
big
departure
from
their
other
offerings
i
am
very
happy
to
say
that
they
nailed
it
with
this
one
velvet
rooster
can
strut
proudly
in
a
belgian
henhouse
full
of
native
varieties
of
this
particular
breed
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
take
on
the
style
that
ill
look
forward
to
every
year
good
beer
im
still
figuring
this
one
out
overall
pretty
nice
american
take
on
a
traditional
belgian
style
of
beer
stands
up
with
a
lot
of
them
not
summer
here
in
boston
but
definitely
summer
in
the
southern
hemisphere
where
this
would
be
enjoyed
at
the
current
moment
smooth
and
light
would
buy
again
notes
very
interesting
this
is
an
excellent
departure
from
your
normal
belgian
overall
i
took
a
chance
with
this
brew
considering
the
ingredients
but
boy
im
glad
i
did
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
with
a
big
flavor
punch
that
is
both
refreshing
and
fruity
but
still
has
a
very
tasty
belgian
core
061012
from
the
bottle
this
is
one
of
the
best
belgian
triples
bite
the
bullet
on
the
price
to
savor
the
best
pretty
good
trippel
with
some
nice
flavor
and
aroma
very
tasty
and
drinks
easy
worth
trying
overall
i
love
the
style
and
this
beer
in
particular
however
for
the
price
id
likely
pass
it
over
in
my
local
bottle
shop
a
nice
way
to
divert
my
attention
away
from
a
style
that
i
usually
dont
care
to
well
care
for
different
gravityenhancers
for
starters
even
if
it
is
that
darned
rice
adjunct
along
with
a
neat
new
to
me
in
beer
at
least
herbal
spiciness
and
an
elevated
abv
whose
manifestation
still
seems
duly
stalled
maybe
its
stuck
in
its
parents
basement
trying
in
vain
to
finish
off
that
last
level

something

easy

very
different
from
most
tripels
i
have
had
as
it
more
closely
resembles
a
witbier
with
its
lemony
citrus
flavors
a
decent
attempt
at
the
tripel
style
really
enjoyed
this
tripel
although
i
seem
to
enjoy
all
tripels
would
have
it
again
for
sure
o
trade
winds
is
a
beer
thats
in
no
way
flashy
or
overthetop
on
the
contrary
its
balanced
and
drinkable
something
thats
kind
of
odd
when
it
comes
to
a
tripel
wheres
the
racing
black
pepper
the
spice
from
just
the
first
sip
you
can
tell
thats
not
what
theyre
after
in
the
end
what
you
get
is
a
refreshing
summertime
beer
that
just
happens
to
share
a
yeast
strain
with
a
belgian
thats
historically
spicy
and
as
far
as
bright
and
cheery
beer
goes
these
guys
nailed
it
o
there
is
no
surprise
trade
winds
is
another
winning
offering
from
the
bruery
being
familie
rue
is
one
of
my
standout
breweries
for
2013
along
with
anchorage
and
uinta
i
didnt
find
a
bottle
of
trade
winds
until
december
although
a
little
late
to
the
game
with
this
one
i
am
aware
that
it
was
not
particularly
fresh
yet
i
purchased
it
anyway
and
glad
i
did
it
reinforces
my
anticipation
for
purchasing
a
fresh
bottle
or
two
or
three
when
it
is
released
again
in
2014
brilliant
golden
hue
and
you
can
tell
this
is
unfiltered
a
half
inch
of
tightly
laced
foam
with
robust
carbonation
throughout
a
blend
of
rice
and
light
belgian
candy
sugar
in
the
aroma
a
brisk
sweetness
at
the
forefront
is
due
to
the
belgian
yeast
strain
the
rice
really
adds
a
nice
dryness
quickly
follows
and
really
gives
a
nice
spin
to
a
belgian
triple
this
was
suggested
to
me
by
the
staff
at
binnys
in
the
chicago
area
i
really
like
the
taste
at
first
i
thought
thai
basil
might
be
a
little
odd
when
i
poured
the
beer
and
smelled
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
good
i
would
buy
this
again
dont
walk
away
from
this
pretty
good
oddly
when
a
beer
maker
sets
out
to
make
an
imperial
witbier
its
ends
up
a
boozy
syrupy
and
sticky
mess
but
without
hardly
trying
the
bruery
created
one
but
based
off
of
tripel
framework
instead
i
rather
like
the
beer
but
not
so
much
as
a
tripel
i
also
like
it
that
the
experimentation
factors
here
dont
define
the
beer
just
offers
a
glimpse
overall
tried
this
on
a
whim
expecting
a
decent
but
maybe
mediocre
beer
very
nice
surprise
also
surprising
how
refreshing
this
is
o
slight
wild
and
distinctly
flavored
tripel
the
nose
has
notes
of
white
pepper
coriander
belgian
yeast
rice
sweet
basil
pineapple
lemon
and
a
heavy
back
of
breadiness
the
taste
is
very
sweet
but
in
a
delicious
way
pineapple
tropical
fruit
coconut
lemon
basil
white
pepper
turbinado
sugar
and
bready
notes
medium
body
nice
carbonation
creamy
but
somewhat
effervescent
mouthfeel
this
is
like
a
really
good
classic
belgianstyle
tripel
but
instead
of
hops
there
is
a
very
sweet
floral
basil
taste
and
instead
of
candi
sugars
there
is
a
great
rice
backbone
good
lacing
excellent
head
retention
wheatrice
belgian
tripel
sub
candi
sugar
with
rice
makes
for
a
very
dry
sake
finish
this
would
be
amazing
with
seared
ahi
with
wasabi
you
can
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
8
1
percent
overall
good
but
definitely
a
sipping
beer
overall
really
impressed
with
this
shelf
distribution
bruery
and
i
will
add
to
my
buy
list
should
i
see
again
o
i
understand
how
this
wouldnt
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
that
being
said
i
really
enjoyed
how
tasty
this
brew
was
and
was
particularly
enameled
with
the
uniqueness
of
the
beer
definitely
need
to
try
this
with
some
thai
or
vietnamese
food
t
i
had
this
at
the
tasting
room
last
week
for
the
first
time
and
i
wasnt
really
a
fan
but
out
of
the
bottle
i
like
it
a
lot
more
it
does
taste
like
a
classic
tripel
but
it
has
just
an
edge
from
the
rice
honestly
im
looking
everywhere
for
the
basil
here
but
im
just
not
getting
it
but
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
color
was
classic
tripelcloudy
amber
almost
orange
aroma
was
nice
but
weak
maybe
my
sinuses
are
acting
up
flavor
was
absolutely
stunning
all
the
wonders
of
a
tripel
plus
a
bit
of
fruitiness
and
the
basil
really
gives
it
a
nice
spice
not
overpowering
by
any
means
but
just
so
flavorful
and
moderate
nicely
balanced
i
need
to
try
this
a
few
more
times
before
i
really
get
a
handle
on
it
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
the
belgian
style
rich
and
tangy
spicy
and
aromatic
flavors
by
far
my
favorite
bruery
beer
crisply
fruity
like
a
good
cider
not
totally
dry
with
the
lingering
breath
of
sweetness
overall
its
a
more
drinkable
sort
of
tripel
and
thoroughly
likable
i
had
this
during
a
summer
cook
out
it
looked
very
inviting
in
the
glass
with
a
color
of
the
inside
of
an
orange
but
i
felt
the
aroma
was
a
little
on
the
weak
side
i
couldnt
taste
the
thai
spice
they
were
talking
about
but
it
was
refreshing
with
a
crisp
finish
overall
it
was
pretty
good
but
i
cant
say
ill
be
investing
in
another
one
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
od
an
excellent
tripel
not
really
what
has
sold
in
the
us
here
lately
where
i
think
it
has
adhered
to
the
funk
and
the
dry
finish
of
the
original
abv
is
fairly
hefty
but
still
low
and
manageable
o
the
breury
never
lets
me
down
and
i
appreciate
their
approach
to
brewing
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
is
a
superb
alternative
to
ipa
crisp
a
little
carbonation
tropical
and
finally
spicy
i
was
not
expecting
this
favor
but
i
enjoyed
the
fusion
overallnice
take
on
the
style
the
thai
basil
makes
a
decent
impression
though
isnt
really
strong
there
are
better
triples
out
there
but
this
is
a
good
experiment
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
style
surprised
and
impressed
by
this
beer
probably
my
favorite
bruery
beer
to
date
low
c
overall
the
bruery
takes
the
tripel
style
normally
a
very
traditional
style
and
completely
reinvigorates
it
the
thai
basil
marries
perfectly
with
the
spicy
yet
sweet
belgian
yeast
and
the
rice
simultaneously
lightens
the
body
and
adds
some
really
nice
texture
to
the
beer
want
a
summer
beer
that
is
complex
refreshing
and
has
some
deceptive
strength
look
no
further
highly
recommended
overall
a
triple
that
is
a
little
different
o
sweet
to
style
but
the
flavor
profile
still
has
nice
integration
and
complexity
very
interesting
herbal
spicy
nose
with
belgian
yeasts
light
malts
a
slight
funk
and
light
fruits
the
basil
is
up
front
and
prominent
pours
brilliant
peach
tinted
gold
under
a
dense
finely
bubbled
3
persistent
lacy
white
foam
cap
the
palate
is
lemony
herbal
spicy
peach
with
caramel
and
biscuit
notes
suggests
an
herbed
peach
cobbler
transformed
to
foam
the
carbonation
is
almost
champagne
like
with
a
slight
winey
slickness
medium
body
and
carbonation
o
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
making
this
beer
easy
to
drink
than
is
often
the
case
with
the
tripel
style
though
the
dryness
makes
you
want
to
sit
rather
slowly
the
addition
of
the
basil
is
interesting
another
interesting
and
delicious
offering
from
the
bruery
this
one
pours
a
nice
light
golden
color
mostly
clear
with
a
really
massive
white
frothy
head
with
fine
retention
the
nose
is
like
fresh
picked
apricots
i
know
there
are
none
in
here
but
i
dont
smell
basil
or
sweet
malt
at
all
not
even
belgian
yeast
really
but
fresh
apricots
its
really
tempting
and
unexpected
the
flavor
is
subtle
not
as
sweet
as
most
tripels
and
yeasty
more
like
a
saison
the
peppery
yeast
goes
well
with
the
basil
but
the
basil
is
way
in
the
back
hardly
distinguishable
if
you
didnt
know
to
look
for
it
the
rice
seems
to
add
some
nice
body
as
this
beer
is
pretty
full
for
its
color
very
bright
carbonation
too
overall
a
really
appealing
beer
that
seems
to
be
just
right
in
early
spring
its
got
the
right
amount
of
spice
and
herbs
going
on
thus
maintaining
its
drinkability
despite
its
higher
abv
as
good
as
expected
the
bruery
can
do
no
wrong
in
my
book
overall
a
good
summer
brew
which
works
well
with
seafood
dishes
salads
and
asian
flavors
recommended
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
overall
its
pretty
good
certainly
not
my
favorite
tripel
and
for
the
price
probably
not
getting
it
again
o
outstanding
i
think
ive
found
a
new
top
ten
favorite
beer
very
balanced
and
subtle
unlike
most
tripels
o
this
is
a
complexly
flavored
but
well
balanced
brew
very
elegant
and
super
drinkable
wouldnt
change
a
thing
other
than
the
weather
in
which
im
drinking
this
its
winter
overall
a
tasty
tripel
i
like
the
element
of
the
thai
basil
it
adds
a
different
element
to
the
standard
tripel
that
gives
it
some
herbal
components
to
it
one
that
i
would
go
back
to
if
i
wanted
the
style
because
it
stands
out
o
an
interesting
take
on
a
tripel
it
works
wonderfully
magical
brew
from
mr
rue
inventive
fun
complex
and
fitting
for
an
appropriate
food
pairing
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
othis
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
maybe
the
most
drinkable
tripel
i
have
ever
had
the
flavors
are
all
there
with
out
any
offflavors
its
not
unique
in
any
way
its
just
a
nice
example
of
a
good
style
to
be
honest
you
might
want
to
have
this
bottle
all
to
yourself
not
sure
how
old
this
is
no
freshness
dating
i
can
see
not
getting
any
thai
basil
love
that
stuff
with
pork
or
chicken
drinkable
enough
but
nothing
mind
blowing
would
buy
again
if
i
knew
i
was
getting
fresh
beer
o
this
review
was
from
my
notes
with
no
overall
impression
judging
by
taste
alone
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
goofy
ingredient
bruery
beers
very
solid
tripel
makes
for
a
great
backbone
to
host
the
subtle
thai
twist
smooth
stuff
indeed
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
then
i
though
i
would
with
it
not
being
one
of
my
favorite
styles
well
rounded
and
unique
o
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
rendition
of
a
belgian
tripel
the
thai
basil
and
rice
really
compliment
the
belgian
yeast
and
fruit
elements
this
beer
would
pair
beautifully
with
salmon
and
other
meatseafood
o
this
was
an
interesting
beer
a
little
bit
different
then
your
average
take
on
a
tripel
definitely
more
clementines
and
fruity
aspect
mixed
with
some
light
thai
influences
such
as
basil
it
balanced
decently
well
but
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
my
favorite
tastes
in
the
world
i
enjoyed
trying
it
but
i
dont
know
if
ill
be
drinking
this
again
in
the
near
future
o
excellent
summer
ale
id
say
this
is
a
sipper
as
it
does
evolve
slowly
but
will
certianly
reward
those
who
take
thier
time
with
it
notes
saisonesque
more
so
than
trippel
or
golden
ale
to
me
if
one
enjoys
herbal
brews
this
is
quite
the
treat
good
to
pair
with
certain
cuisines
and
to
stimulate
a
social
gathering
great
take
on
a
tripel
and
a
spectacular
brew
although
i
didnt
really
notice
any
basil
but
that
may
have
been
the
funkyness
i
was
picking
up
o
highly
recommended
and
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
tasted
with
a
really
nice
twist
to
keep
things
interesting
would
definitely
drink
again
great
beer
addendum
the
beer
happened
to
have
warmed
very
nicely
and
it
grew
on
my
palate
and
by
the
end
of
my
drink
i
was
really
enjoying
it
drinkability
pretty
high
could
work
well
with
asian
food
will
need
to
do
a
return
test
with
appropriate
cuisine
o
interesting
mix
of
flavors
not
exactly
sure
what
thai
basil
tastes
like
but
there
is
definitely
a
herbal
note
has
somewhat
of
a
saison
resemblance
but
i
prefer
the
bruerys
saisons
more
tasty
good
but
not
great
o
really
enjoyed
this
interpretation
of
a
tripel
from
the
bruery
with
the
fresh
grassy
note
combined
with
the
herbal
aspect
this
is
big
time
appreciated
o
always
like
bruery
and
trade
winds
didnt
disappoint
not
a
convential
tripel
at
all
but
the
concept
they
were
going
for
came
out
well
enjoyable

tripel
in
a

why
not
o
very
good
o
a
well
made
tripel
with
a
nice

something
different
many
of

you
expect
along

with

just

this

overall
not
a
bad

at

thoughtprovoking
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
albeit
a

a

any

also
a
good

never
hurts
to
bring
out
the
earthy
textures
and
tastes
hidden
within
a
beer
a
dave
o
tasty
tripel
with
some
very
unique
aspects
o
really
pleasant
not
too
sweet
and
with
some
variation
in
the
flavor
through
the
bottle
o
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
and
delicious
aftertaste
d
very
drinkable
really
full
and
complex
flavors
with
everything
coming
together
really
nicely
the
balance
of
the
traditional
belgian
flavors
with
the
basil
and
other
ingredients
is
excellent

cream
colored
half
inch
of

does

smell
is
off

for
a

not
your
typical
belgian
scent
some
spicy
scent
thai
basil
with
big
pale
malt
with
some
masked
aroma
hops
with
grassy
appeal
im
not
turned
off
by
the
flavor
its
just
different
for
me
im
used
to
the
belgians
first
off
i
think
the
spice
is
a
bit
to
pronounced
its
all
i
taste
that
basil
flavor
it
sort
of
over
takes
the
beer
leaving
no
room
for
interpretation
under
that
the
light
body
brings
forth
alot
of
pale
malt
flavor
some
apple
comes
out
in
the
end
but
the
spice
prevails
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
imo
between
light
and
medium
just
falls
short
of
carrying
the
beer
further
bright
carb
with
bubbles
no
problem
there
alive
like
a
good
triple
should
be
a
whole
bottle
of
this
would
have
been
a
chore
and
a
half
a
decent
tripel
but
there
is
some
odd
funk
in
there
wild
yeast
maybe
but
i
dont
think
this
was
brewed
with
any
the
basil
is
hard
to
pick
out
but
i
can
see
its
impact
with
all
the
vegetal
herbal
notes
i
realized
after
i
drank
this
that
it
is
a
summer
seasonal
and
shouldve
been
consumed
fresh
so
ill
have
to
give
this
another
try
i
applaud
the
bruery
for
making
interesting
unique
beers
but
this
one
didnt
really
work
that
well
for
me
its
not
a
tripel
its
its
own
violent
weather
analogy
of
aromatics
superb
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
lots
of
fruity
notes
as
well
as
slight
vegetal
tomato
taste
as
well
as
basil
very
wellrounded
and
a
unique
take
on
the
style
highly
recommended
would
drink
again
do
although
triple
isnt
my
favorite
style
this
is
probably
one
of
my
fav
examples
it
has
a
sharpness
that
is
kind
of
a
punch
in
the
face
and
a
complexity
of
flavors
that
is
really
enjoyable
i
dont
want
this
every
day

i
have
to
say
that
i
was
a
tad
disappointed
with
what
was
on
the
label
versus
what
the
flavor
turned
out
to
be
with
that
said
high
carbonation

i
do
like

will
try
another
fresh
bottle
next
spring
havent
had
many
tripels
in
awhile
but
fluffy
rabbits
is
excellent
and
a
good
example
in
general
of
american
brewers
staying
relatively
true
to
style
while
upping
the
assertiveness
of
these
beers
this
is
a
complex
melange
of
full
bodied
yeast
sugary
alcohol
with
also
an
assertive
floralpineyherbal
hop
character
all
woven
together
to
make
for
an
intense
but
memorable
brew
overall
def
not
my
favorite
did
not
really
like
the
taste
o
very
nice
distinct
and
wellmade
definitely
a
tripel
id
go
back
to
had
plenty
of
the
typical
characteristics
so
theres
no
mistaking
it
as
a
tripel
but
the
hoppiness
lent
it
an
american
ipakinda
character
too
overall
enjoyed
a
lot
over
the
years
pretty
nice
stuff
overall
this
is
not
a
traditional
tripel
and
while
its
good
in
terms
of
a
tripel
i
find
it
lacking
a
lot
i
dont
like
the
bubblegummy
flavor
in
this
style
and
the
earthiness
seems
to
make
the
other
tastes
more
subtle
i
would
have
this
again
any
time
it
was
my
first
beer
from
pretty
things
and
im
definitely
intrigued
will
look
for
others
a
touch
hot
but
good
depth
of
flavor
the
bitterness
is
more
than
i
prefer
but
great
balance
otherwise
light
amber
hue
short
head
little
lacing
the
heads
a
little
thicker
with
a
very
vigorous
pour
but
the
appearance
while
perfectly
ok
is
not
exceptional
candylike
aroma
long
on
bubble
gum
the
taste
is
quite
pleasant
if
perhaps
a
little
more
confectionary
than
other
leading
tripels
theres
banana
theres
cotton
candy
but
its
a
sophisticated
sweetnessboth
inviting
and
satisfying
texture
is
sufficiently
rich
o
i
think
this
one
compares
very
favorably
to
some
of
the
toprated
tripels
that
ive
tried
not
sure
if
its
a
deviation
from
the
style
or
not
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
golden
ale
that
ive
really
enjoyed
then
the
tripels
that
i
typically
shy
away
from
pour
is
lightly
hazed
yellowish
amber
with
a
fairly
tight
white
head
nose
is
predominantly
candied
sugar
light
earthy
note
and
some
sweet
lemon
taste
is
a
bit
more
sweet
but
has
some
other
things
going
on
hints
of
peppery
yeast
and
light
tang
sweeter
candied
sugar
faint
candied
lemon
not
much

smooth

yellow

noble

really

the
taste
follows
the
nose
closely
with
a
lively
belgian
peppery
yeast
flavor
mixing
so
well
with
the
candi
sugar
and
all
the
other
flavors
that
i
picked
up
on
in
the
smell
delightfully
sweet
and
not
cloying
at
all
in
fact
a
little
juicy
and
bright
in
flavor
really
wonderful
a
surprisingly
full
and
creamy
body
that
was
a
little
surprising
but
enjoyable
but
finished
drier
the
more
i
drank
overall
this
was
a
real
delight
maybe
my
new
favorite
from
pretty
things
this
beer
got
me
into
more
of
what
these
guys
brew
and
so
far
i
am
very
satified
everything
tastes
so
fresh
o
definitely
quite
a
hoppy
tripel
with
a
good
bit
of
spiciness
fruitiness
and
funk
to
start
off
nothing
mind
shattering
but
a
solid
stab
at
an
americanized
version
of
the
style
o
in
a
sea
of
tripels
some
overly
complex
and
others
boring
this
one
stands
out
as
being
very
subtle
yet
very
tasty
only
the
second
beer
ive
had
by
pretty
things
and
both
have
been
great
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
in
a
bottle
the
appearance
is
of
a
medium
gold
yellowish
plus
a
hint
hazy
with
a
nice
white
head
color
the
smell
is
of
dry
apples
flowers
and
a
dash
of
vanilla
a
wonderful
almost
bubble
gum
taste
along
with
hoppy
spicy
yeast
flavor
yum
very
pleasant
to
drink
not
overly
hoppy
but
very
flavorful
o
a
damn
solid
beer
highly
recommended
pretty
things
continues
to
impress
and
this
is
perhaps
the
most
preciselyexecuted
of
their
beers
ive
had
spot
on
kudos
a
damn
fine
tripel
and
worth
getting
your
hands
if
you
can
i
plan
on
getting
at
least
one
more
to
share
with
friends
the
tripel
is
pretty
complex
but
i
had
to
wait
a
bit
for
the
beer
to
warm
up
before
i
could
get
the
flavors
o
this
is
a
complex
brew
but
can
be
simplified
as
a
hoppy
tripel
plenty
of
tropical
fruit
citrus
rind
and
spicy
yeast
notes
its
balanced
in
some
ways
but
has
so
much
personality
its
absolutely
an
expressive
and
unique
tripel
but
is
put
together
so
well
well
done
dependable
exciting
complex
that
said
it
can
be
enjoyed
as
both
a
special
sipper
or
an
everyday
drinker
its
that
flexible
this
is
pretty
things
o
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
but
one
that
needs
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
as
the
abv
is
fairly
high
and
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
noticeable
i
was
really
happy
to
find
this
beer
again
since
i
had
really
enjoyed
it
a
few
years
back
before
i
was
writing
reviews
i
had
fond
memories
of
the
beer
and
it
was
just
as
good
a
well
made
triple
have
a
new
brewery
to
be
distributed
here
in
kentucky
nothing
special
here
but
i
cant
see
anyone
a
fan
of
this
style
being
disappointed
overall
i
love
this
experimental
brew
it
takes
the
aspects
of
dry
hoping
and
mixes
it
up
with
the
fruity
aspects
of
your
typical
belgium
triple
if
its
still
around
i
will
be
sure
to
acquire
another
bottle
especially
for
5
bucks
o
nice
twist
to
a
tripel
belgian
overall
id
rather
just
have
one
style
or
the
other

very

from

of

favorite
american
brewers
doing
belgian
styles
this
beer
maintains
the
spirit
of
belgium
while
giving
it
a
definate
american
twist
appearance
is
golden
to
yellow
in
the
glass
but
has
good
head
and
laces
nicely
on
the
glass
head
retention
is
good
too
and
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
the
aroma
is
grassy
and
citrus
most
likely
lemon
taste
is
great
but
i
think
this
is
somewhat
misclassified
as
it
comes
off
as
a
strong
saison
lots
of
nice
spice
and
a
good
citrus
presence
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
its
hard
to
be
let
down
by
pretty
things
honestly
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
pretty
things
style
which
i
find
totally
appealing
which
is
offbeat
but
highly
drinkable
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
krisp
in
downtown
san
diego
lighter
body
but
carbonation
doesnt
lighten
things
up
very
much
some
warmth
from
alcohol
not
bad
i
expected
a
bit
more
complexity
as
the
nose
indicated
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
nicely
and
alcohol
is
hidden
this
is
a
well
done
tripel
top
two
from
the
us
in
my
opinion
overall
its
the
feel
of
this
beer
that
gets
me
the
most
its
very
enjoyable
super
easy
to
drink
too

more
pretty
things
home
runs
the
amount
and
type
of
flowery
overtones
are
what
i
normally
expect
from
witbiers
or
overly
floral
blonde
ales
this
seems
to
mask
the
dry
spice
and
earthen
tones
that
are
celebrated
best
in
trappist
versions
its
creaminess
seems
to
give
the
beer
more
body
instead
of
dryness
and
is
slow
to
develop
dryness
but
these
are
picky
criticisms
this
is
still
a
very
well
made
tripel
ale
o
a
delicious
tripel
standard
flavors
but
with
a
hoppedup
balance
that
separates
it
from
the
more
traditional
belgians
youd
come
across
a
musttry
for
belgian
fans
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
hoppiness
but
im
not
sure
of
the
bottle
age
o
this
is
a
decent
tripel
i
like
the
ingenuity
of
adding
amarillo
hops
creating
that
tropical
fruit
characteristics
overall
very
enjoyable
but
not
spectacular

its
a

i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
and
at

a
bottle
id
buy
it
again
o
overall
the
aging
of
this
beer
really
brings
out
the
flavors
10
fold
and
make
this
an
excellent
beer
to
try
the

abv
is
well
hidden
behind
all
the
bursting
flavors
one
of
the
best
fruit
type
beers
ive
had
this
beer
has
one
of
the
best
names
around
it
also
helps
that
the
style
makes
fluffy
white
rabbits
a
must
try
it
pours
a
lighter
bodied
cloudy
yet
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
bright
white
and
soapy
head
the
nose
is
light
and
yeasty
there
is
a
light
citrusy
hop
character
and
a
slight
buttery
aspect
but
not
like
diacetyl
like
short
termed
chardonnay
barrel
aging
its
intriguing
nonetheless
the
flavors
are
light
and
citrusy
the
yeast
is
mild
yet
flavorful
it
is
what
i
would
call
an
off
dry
there
is
a
light
and
clean
hoppiness
it
has
nice
flavor
and
does
what
it
promises
it
drinks
light
in
body
with
a
light
yeasty

like
it

of
coriander
great
bright

fresh
red
apple
aroma
as
well

just
like
the

very
tinglt
peppery
feel
on

and
bitter

which
immediately
turn
to

flavor
with
more

mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
very
hoppy
and
spicy
tripel
but
it
tastes
damn
good
o
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
very
well
made
the
flavors
and
complexity
are
astounding
if
the
head
production
was
bigger
this
beer
would
be
perfect
this
is
my
first
beer
from
pretty
things
and
if
their
other
beers
are
this
good
it
wont
be
my
last
originally
reviewed

o
as
the
name
suggests
soft
and
fluffy
surprisingly
juicy
on
the
palate
very
balanced
with
a
nice
hoppy
zing
in
the
finish
of
lemony
citrus
and
grassy
florals
there
is
no
alcohol
presence
whatsoever
which
makes
this
one
dangerously
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
americanmade
tripel
o
once
again
i
am
impressed
by
pretty
things
a
tripel
that
really
hides
the
alcohol
great
for
springtime
per
the
label
bright
yellow
in
color
with
just
the
slightest
haze
poured
with
a
billowy
white
foam
that
is
fed
by
an
endless
stream
of
migrating
bubbles
wheat
malt
banana
and
yeasty
aromas
with
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
background
creamy
smooth
with
a
heavy
wheat
malt
body
and
rich
carbonation
wheat
malt
up
front
that
quickly
transitions
to
a
combination
of
citrus
hops
and
sweet
fruity
banana
into
the
middle
spicy
flavors
pick
up
in
the
middle
that
return
to
light
bitter
hops
and
sweet
banana
wheat
and
bready
malt
flavor
grows
through
the
middle
and
to
the
finish
as
well
finishes
with
a
spicy
flavor
that
tapers
to
bitter
hoppiness
very
complex
and
enjoyable
a
fabulous
triple
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
a
somewhat
outofthebox
tripel
i
dont
think
the
belgians
use
quite
this
much
wheat
its
almost
an
imperial
wit
still
i
like
the
overall
effect
and
id
definitely
drink
this
again
poured
a
34
white
head
which
faded
a
little
faster
than
id
expected
it
has
a
pretty
body
kind
of
a
light
hazy
lemonade
yellow
color
smell
is
very
promising
with
tropical
fruit
and
hints
of
sweet
tartness
the
taste
mirrors
that
smell
pretty
well
and
adds
some
malt
theres
a
medium
rich
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
length
finish
a
fine
product
and
true
to
the

this
beer
is
an
excellent
piece
of
brewing
as
i
noted
above
it
may
not
have
the
flavor
to
hold
its
own
against
the
most
revered
belgianstyle
tripels
but
it
has
its
own
distinct
character
its
subtly
hoppedup
refreshing
and
has
a
beautifully
creamy
texture
that
i
personally
think
is
to
die
for
this
is
not
a
beer
you
could
call
forgettable
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
it
runs
between
7
and
8
for
a
22
oz
bomber
one
of
the
best
pretty
things
beers
ive
tried
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazy
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
frothy
white
light
fluffy
head
that
is
low
and
clingy
nose
of
light
spicing
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
over
a
toasted
grain
backbone
flavors
are
rich
and
roasty
with
a
slightly
tangy
syrupy
sweet
highlight
toasted
grain
backbone
with
some
citrus
sweet
dont
balance
well
and
the
spicing
just
gets
in
the
way
too
light
to
really
effect
the
palate
the
spicing
seems
superfluous
smooth
full
body
with
a
rich
sweet
and
slightly
spicy
aftertaste
the
finish
starts
smooth
and
transitions
into
a
spiced
slightly
sharp
feel
this
beer
was
a
bit
all
over
the
place
for
me
a
real
gem
o
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
belgian
tripel
with
good
complexity
making
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
o
the
intent
here
seems
to
be
for
the
hops
to
accentuate
but
not
dominate
that
is
exactly
what
they
do
dont
be
expecting
a
belgian
ipa
riddled
with
american
hops
the
hop
tastes
are
mellow
and
seem
predominately
english
though
the
american
hops
shine
through
too
and
moreso
as
the
beer
warms
i
never
really
thought
those
oilyleafy
tastes
that
english
hops
bring
to
the
table
really
meshed
well
with
the
tripel
style
american
hops
are
the
better
play
accentuating
the
tropical
esters
which
are
also
largely
absent
here
by
adding
citrusytropical
tastes
of
their
own
perhaps
my
memory
fails
me
but
this
beer
is
not
what
i
remember
it
being
when
i
had
it
a
year
or
two
ago
i
find
myself
slightly
underwhelmed
it
has
some
complexity
but
it
comes
mostly
from
the
hops
rather
than
the
base
beer
still
i
cant
leave
it
without
some
praise
it
is
very
drinkable
and
its
more
charming
attributes
begin
to
grow
on
you
as
you
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
will
make
an
effort
to
revisit
it
in
the
near
future
i
had
given
it
glowing
reviews
in
the
past
maybe
im
having
an
off
night
odthis
has
been
one
of
the
more
elusive
pretty
things
brews
for
me
it
is
also
one
of
the
breweries
most
highly
regarded
creations
its
pretty
damn
tasty
but
not
my
favorite
from
pretty
things
i
dont
love
tripels
generally
and
this
may
be
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
from
the
style
o
a
really
nice
tripel
pretty
things
does
it
again
will
be
on
the
lookout
to
try
this
one
fresh
to
get
the
hops
fresh
but
this
beer
was
great
without
it
o
another
very
good
brew
from
pretty
things
one
i
look
forward
to
every
year
o
really
solid
brew
the
sweetness
and
spicy
notes
play
well
off
each
other
and
the
dry
finish
brings
it
all
together
o
delightful
belgian
brew
nicely
hopped
too
the
hops
are
nowhere
near
overwhelming
recommended
overall
great
beer
that
i
wait
for
each
spring
one
of
their
single
best
beers
o
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
a
lot
and
very
happy
that
i
have
gotten
the
chance
to
try
this
one
very
good
beer
all
around
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
aroumd
the
aroma
was
akin
to
some
kind
of
spicy
green
tea
at
first
lots
of
light
grain
yeast
aromas
of
fresh
leaves
and
a
touch
of
light
citrus
sprinkled
in
a
spiciness
i
am
assuming
from
the
basil
leaves
very
intresting
aroma
for
sure
the
flavor
was
light
nicely
balanced
with
a
lightly
grainy
start
to
it
that
turned
over
to
some
light
fruit
peaches
maybe
green
apples
coming
through
in
the
middle
with
that
nice
light
and
very
fresh
leaf
like
flavor
hints
of
spice
rippled
throughout
especially
in
the
finish
which
was
dry
and
nicely
accented
overall
this
is
a
unique
take
on
the
style
but
definitely
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had
id
like
to
see
a
little
less
focus
on
the
hops
wow
never
thought
i
would
say
that
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
easy
going
down
and
tastes
great
i
could
have
a
few
rounds
of
this
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
another
solid
offering
from
pretty
things
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
of
their
beers
this
was
quite
good
and
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
takes
on
an
american
tripel
that
ive
had
out
of
the
bottle
this
just
has
a
lot
of
fresh
hop
character
to
it
that
is
nicely
complimented
by
the
spice
and
fruit
flavors
that
the
belgian
yeast
brought
to
this
i
think
that
the
freshness
is
the
key
with
this
one
though
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
id
wait
until
the
next
batch
at
this
rate
o
overall
this
was
a
very
good
tripel
its
pretty
much
as
the
description
goes
its
a
tripel
with
a
good
hop
smell
and
flavor
to
it
it
mainly
just
adds
to
the
fruitiness
of
the
beer
and
gives
it
a
bit
more
character
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
pretty
big
head
on
it
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
as
well
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
floral
and
sweet
with
a
light
hoppy
aroma
in
the
mix
the
taste
was
sweet
upfront
and
settled
into
a
nice
floral
spice
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
i
would
enjoy
having
it
again
one
day
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
crisp
hop
bite
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
spice
yeast
alcohol
and
light
fruit
notes
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
floral
hops
give
off
a
dry
earthy
bitterness
with
some
soilpine
character
up
front
which
counter
the
sweeter
notes
of
the
beer
pretty
nicely
not
overly
hoppy
but
just
enough
to
add
some
complexity
and
balance
the
hops
are
complimented
by
some
zesty
spice
namely
pepper
coriander
and
candy
sugar
im
also
picking
up
some
citrus
and
other
light
fruits
orange
peel
apple
pear
and
apricot
there
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
flavor
toward
the
end
of
the
palate
but
i
wouldnt
really
call
this
beer
hot
this
is
a
unique
twist
on
the
triple
style
that
they
pulled
off
pretty
well
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
fruity
and
spicy
in
all
the
right
places
thanks
again
michael
im
guessing
its
a
belgian
inspired
beer
it
reminds
me
of
something
that
fantôme
would
do
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
moderately
carbonated
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
didnt
linger
long
aroma
of
sweet
light
malts
citrus
floral
notes
with
light
spices
nice
flavor
full
of
light
sugars
peaches
citrus
and
just
enough
hops
to
give
it
a
nice
dry
finish
light
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
o
light
but
a
touch
sweet
the
flavor
up
front
is
yeasty
tangy
and
gently
sweet
with
a
mild
malt
body
and
hint
of
ripe
tropical
fruit
which
leads
to
a
more
citrus
and
spice
flavor
and
the
bitterness
comes
forward
in
the
middle
the
flavor
is
lightly
toasted
in
the
malt
dept
and
a
slight
grassy
herbal
element
also
peeks
through
with
only
a
slight
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
the
gentle
citrus
notes
add
a
mild
level
of
astringency
and
you
get
the
idea
there
is
some
candy
sugar
as
the
flavor
leans
to
the
sweet
side
but
a
hint
of
hoppiness
is
still
present
in
the
finish
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
a
satisfying
and
drinkable
beer
for
the
abv
i
think
it
fits
the
style
well
a
hoppier
more
american
take
on
the
tripel
style
which
is
refereshing
and
well
brewed
o
definitely
an
american
version
because
of
the
aggressive
hops
it
actually
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
though
with
the
belgian
yeast
which
can
be
pretty
dominant
in
many
tripels
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
and
i
like
it
nice
sipper
on
a
summer
evening
even
though
its
mo
is
a
hoppy
beer
i
feel
i
opened
this
one
too
early
perhaps
with
some
time
this
tripel
would
mellow
out
and
become
slightly
more
balanced
with
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
solid
beer
o
overall
its
ok
ive
been
finding
that
pretty
things
has
a
a
style
to
the
flavor
and
sometimes
it
works
i
love
baby
tree
and
jack
dor
and
dont
even
get
me
started
on
our
finest
regards
and
other
times
it
is
a
bit
off
nonetheless
this
is
a
brewery
worth
checking
out
and
i
will
continue
to
try
their
catalog
i
could
see
people
loving
this
one
and
i
can
also
see
them
not
being
blown
away
which
was
the
case
for
me
easy
drinker
though
just
a
bit
overboard
on
bubblegum
kind
of
like
if
shorts
made
a
beer
called
bubblegum
othis
beer
is
awesome
a
fruity
taste
smacks
your
pallet
first
followed
by
a
very
dry
ending
leaving
you
wanting
more
it
would
be
easy
to
knock
back
a
lot
of
these
and
wonder
where
the
day
went
o
overall
a
decent
tripel
though
nothing
special
the
bubblegum
and
banana
aromasflavors
really
dominate
the
nose
and
palate
instead
of
letting
the
yeast
and
fruity
characteristics
come
through
the
attenuation
and
carbonation
are
also
a
bit
lower
than
what
i
consider
makes
a
good
tripel
o
ptbap
are
slowly
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
they
have
passion
behind
what
they
do
they
are
not
just
throwing
ingredients
together
to
see
what
happens
its
a
great
brew
well
done
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
thought
it
was
a
nice
take
on
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
23
of
these
and
it
was
nice
easter
beer
pours
lightly
clouded
and
a
slightly
darker
shade
of
golden
color
quarter
inch
head
very
little
lace
smell
is
much
better
with
pear
and
apple
and
hints
of
alcohol
fruity
up
front
malt
and
yeast
then
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
taste
is
well
balanced
and
complex
smooth
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
warming
alcohol
that
is
not
overpowering
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
real
fast
i
liked
this
one
handily
very
juicy
and
indeed
quite
hoppy
but
never
bitter
or
aggressive
the
hop
bill
was
chosen
wisely
to
create
a
very
beneficial
juiciness
and
pear
element
d
its
only
fitting
to
drink
this
beer
on
easter
this
tripel
from
the
gypsy
brewery
that
is
pretty
things
is
a
very
good
beer
it
has
nice
spicy
notes
with
subtle
fruity
characteristics
well
balanced
and
a
very
easy
drink
at
8
5
hv
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
wanted
more
of
a
hop
presence
given
the
description
the
other
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
i
would
have
another
lighter
medium
body
higher
carb
tingly
and
dry
drinks
well
fairly
refreshing
despite
the
higher
abv
which
is
actually
masked
nicely
would
drink
again
body
is
on
the
thin
side
but
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
finish
is
dry
fro
the
style
but
i
prefer
that
anyways
there
is
some
warming
as
it
goes
down
hinting
at
the
8
5
but
not
detracting
too
much
from
the
overall
score
not
my
favorite
pt
beer
and
certainly
not
the
best
tripel
but
well
worth
seeking
out
this
interesting
take
on
the
style
somehow
i
suspect
that
dann
paquette
understands
this
phenomena
when
he
brews
certain
styles
in
his
own
offthepath
way
and
just
smiles
a
knowing
smile
realizing
the
consumer
will
somehow
get
it
ill
get
some
more
the
spicesherbs
are
almost
too
much
though
they
never
quite
overwhelm
the
base
yeastmalthops
combination
something
about
this
beer
other
than
the
rabbits
reminds
me
of
easter
while
not
exactly
true
to
its
belgian
progenitors
id
definitely
buy
this
again
on
a
seasonal
basis
were
it
in
my
market
this
is
a
wonderful
tripel
it
is
a
little
more
hoppy
and
a
bit
lighter
feeling
than
some
of
the
belgian
styles
ive
had
making
it
almost
like
a
heavier
saison
but
its
really
delicious
nonetheless
o
this
is
really
quite
enjoyabledrinkable
tastes
so
fresh
and
earthygrassy
perfect
for
spring
again
enjoyed
the
hop
bite
and
bitterness
really
pops
on
the
tongue
some
may
find
it
too
bitter
or
over
the
top
with
hops
but
i
really
felt
like
it
was
well
balanced
in
a
way
very
smooth
drinking
curious
as
to
how
this
would
hold
up
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
overall
i
think
the
booziness
hold
this
beer
back
i
regularly
drink
imperial
stouts
and
strong
belgians
like
its
nothing
but
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
get
through
d
very
drinkable
the
8
5
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
nice
blend
of
flavors
with
a
nice
addition
of
a
touch
of
hops
really
smooth
and
well
balanced
overall
its
an
awesome
beer
a
cool
take
on
a
style
that
i
havent
seen
much
done
with
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
im
not
sure
whether
it
would
get
better
or
worse
with
time
prost
overall
a
really
nice
tripel
with
impressive
balance
nice
combination
of
bitter
earthy
hops
and
fruity
belgian
notes
another
solid
borderline
stellar
offering
by
pretty
things
not
bad
but
definitely
lacks
the
complexity
of
a
good
tripel
o
it
is
a
weird
beer
one
sip
it
drinks
like
a
champ
the
next
it
can
feel
like
a
chore
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
imo
in
that
the
extra
carbonation
really
helps
it
out
o
very
interesting
american
take
on
this
classic
belgian
style
hops
meld
beautifully
with
the
classic
taste
of
this
brew
hops
werent
just
carelessly
thrown
into
the
kettle
o
because
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
consumed
slowly
although
it
is
a
good
sipper
pours
a
clear
yelloworange
with
a
thin
soapy
head
crystal
clear
with
some
bubbles
flowing
up
from
the
bottom
of
the

very
inviting
belgian

very

on

probably
my
favorite
offering
by
pretty
things
i
will
definitely
be
sending
out
these
this
springsummer
as
extras
beer
is
a
nice
golden
sunset
yellow
very
cloudy
with
a
nice
thin
white
head
aroma
is
belgian
funk
and
crisp
pears
and
green
apples
taste
is
unique
for
a
tripel
there
is
still
the
funky
belgian
yeast
but
there
is
also
this
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
the
hops
really
go
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
upfront
flavors
it
makes
this
tripel
one
of
the
most
drinkible
and
thirst
quenching
out
there
i
love
the
different
take
on
one
of
my
favorite
styles
d
a
very
nice
american
take
on
a
classic
belgian
style
complex
but
balanced
and
the
added
bitterness
from
the
hops
give
this
ale
an
extra
dimension
o
mmhmm
this
ia
yet
another
solid
delicious
offering
from
pretty
things
great
tripel
characteristics
with
their
own
slight
take
on
things
my
only
knock
on
this
would
be
the
appearance
a
nice
fluffy
head
and
clinging
lacing
would
make
this
beer
oh
so
much
better
could
not
guess
the
alcohol
level
on
this
one
as
it
hides
in
the
expressive
flavors
great
on
a
warm
spring
day
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
no
head
an
only
a
little
lacing
smells
of
lemon
zest
green
apples
and
some
orange
peel
also
has
a
spicy
twist
from
yeast
and
hops
the
hops
are
deep
in
the
background
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
a
refreshing
lemonorange
juiciness
upfront
with
a
full
middle
of
some
doughy
sour
malt
that
finishes
with
a
strong
tingle
and
a
dry
lemon
peel
finish
the
hop
bitterness
in
the
end
is
strong
and
makes
you
want
more
and
more
good
drinkability
wanted
just
a
touch
more
complexity
but
that
is
a
real
picky
bitch
about
this
i
will
get
this
again
before
it
disappears
very
worthy
love
it
im
a
true
hophead
but
ive
fallen
in
love
with
this
one
surprisingly
smooth
for
an
8
5
abv
enters
the
mouth
spicy
and
goes
down
with
a
slight
kick
of
bitterness
somewhere
in
there
is
a
sniff
of
belgium
wheat
again
with
limited
experience
pretty
much
top
of
class
for
a
tripel
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
crisp
and
feels
rather
light
for
8
5
abv
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
beer
and
provides
a
unique
twist
on
the
tripel
o
a
great
offering
from
a
brewery
that
is
local
to
me
i
will
definitely
pick
up
a
few
bombers
each
year
that
this
is
released
to
celebrate
the
oncoming
spring
put
this
beside
delirium
tremens
and
la
fin
du
monde
any
day
and
id
say
itd
be
just
underneath
them
this
is
very
good
and
being
from
ma
its
nice
to
have
this
brewery
close
by
im
gonna
need
more
maybe
a
case
overall
this
a
great
enjoyable
tripel
full
of
flavor
and
quite
refreshing
nice
take
on
the
style
and
another
hit
from
pretty
things
mo
a
little
thin
for
a
tripel
lacks
a
little
in
complexity
too
easy
to
drink
though
o
a
very
quality
beer
everything
they
put
out
seems
to
be
its
not
my
favorite
by
them
but
its
certainly
in
the
top
5
keep
em
coming
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
big
and
fluffy
if
i
can
steal
from
the
name
there
is
a
loosely
open
feel
to
this
beer
it
is
big
but
it
is
also
inflated
with
carbonation
to
make
it
feel
light
at
times
dvery
drinkable
refreshing
and
has
the
right
balance
between
the
hops
and
typical
triple
sweetness
just
a
crispy
clean
drinker
and
a
perfect
spring
offering
from
the
best
brewer
in
boston
d
really
tasty
easy
enough
to
drink
the
8
5
strength
hardly
shows
until
the
finish
proceed
with
caution
hoppy
triple
is
such
an
interesting
concept
this
blurs
a
line
between
the
styles
well
tho
not
as
well
as
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
imo
houblon

like
to
have

drinkability
i
had
this
on
tap
when
it
was
fresh
and
it
was
much
more
hoppy
but
i
actually
prefer
it
now
as
the
flavors
are
more
balanced
drinkability
liked
it
very
drinkable
not
as
sweet
as
a
traditional
tripel
i
would
classify
this
offering
as
a
tripel
with
a
twist
tastes
like
a
lemon
saison
lots
of
lemon
but
it
not
overpowering
i
get
no
hops
but
this
isnt
bad
a
bit
of
spice
in
it
as
well
d
while
it
lacks
the
sweetness
and
overtly
fruity
character
that
i
generally
associate
with
a
tripel
it
adheres
to
the
bjcp
guidelines
very
well
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
an
8
5
beer
while
im
not
overwhelmed
this
is
a
respectable
beer
that
delivers
on
the
style
pours
a
straw

yellow
lots
of
carbonation
citrusmalty

some

coriander
maybe
cinnamon
taste
is
a

some

and
ginger
mouthfeel

bit
thin
im
not
crazy
about
this
one
not
enough
in
the
belgian
tradition
well
fluffy
white
rabbits
was
gone
in
short
order
thats
for
sure
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
with
a
bit
of
tweaking
i
think
could
really
come
into
its
own
needs
a
bit
of
panache
and
unique
style
if
i
may
say
so
then
again
if
i
brewed
this
id
be
joyous
recommended

you
can
get
it

d
a
fantastic
drinking
tripel
alcohol
is
virtually
nonexistant
great
beer
i
was
only
told
that
this
was
a
tripel
when
i
asked
about
it
it
was
served
to
me
in
a
twelve
ounce
glass
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
it
was
a
little
on
the
dry
side
but
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
was
a
hoppy
tripel
in
any
case
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
alcohol
is
high
enough
to
pack
a
punch
but
not
so
high
as
to
knock
you
out
pardon
the
metaphor
very
good
drinker
ill
get
it
again
fluffy
white
rabbits
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
it
has
a
nice
interplay
between
fruity
yeast
flavors
and
hops
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
feels
a
bit
thin
what
a
crazy
tripel
but
oh
so
good
first
off
it
tastes
like
a
bowl
of
fruity
pebbles
cereal
but
with
only
the
lemon
fruity
pebbles
obviously
lemony
with
hints
of
clove
earthy
flowers
loam
spice
and
apricot
light
in
weight
and
body
but
big
in
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
into
my
duvel
tulip
judged
on
the
first
pour
alone
i
would
have
scored
a
3
for
appearance
as
a
two
finger
white
cap
formed
and
dissipated
quickly
without
leaving
much
lacing
behind
the
second
pour
was
a
bit
better
though
with
a
3
finger
head
that
stuck
around
at
least
briefly
still
not
much
in
the
way
of
lace
though
and
this
is
one
style
where
i
definitely
have
some
expectations
in
that
department
the
nose
is
decent
an
appreciable
sweetness
and
some
juicy
citrus
hop
notes
fill
in
where
usually
id
notice
the
yeasts
influence
fluffy
white
rabbits
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
a
brief
opening
hop
bitterness
quickly
fades
and
is
replaced
by
traditional
tripel
pale
malt
sweetness
and
yeast
spiciness
the
beer
closes
beautifully
with
the
aforementioned
hops
still
juicy
and
citrusy
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
light
for
the
style
with
a
nice
bubbly
carbonation
no
booziness
at
8
5
is
always
appreciated
and
helps
make
this
beer
disappear
quickly
though
any
brew
that
tastes
this
good
isnt
bound
to
last
long
in
my
glass
another
wonderful
beer
from
dann
paquette
at
pretty
things
but
thats
par
for
the
course
from
them
d
i
am
crazed
over
this
brew
i
will
crave
it
daily
from
now
until
i
live
in
a
distribution
area
this
beer
manages
to
be
smooth
balanced
and
sharp
all
at
the
same
time
completely
original
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
tastes
much
like
this
at
all
this
is
one
of
the
most
original
beers
ive
ever
come
across
d
a
delicate
and
sophisticated
tripel
goes
down
easy
sip
after
sip
another
damn
fine
offering
from
pretty
things
this
beer
brings
out
the
simple
characteristics
i
love
of
tripels
and
ditches
anything
else
it
tastes
tripelinfluenced
not
so
much
a
traditional
tripel
semantics
its
clean
wellmade
and
enjoyable
enjoy
beer
has
no
real
forward
palate
flavor
some
carbonation
in
the
mouth
and
some
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
in
the
mid
to
late
palate
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
overall
just
an
average
tripel
nothing
too
special
they
really
should
have
just
gone
after
the
hoppiness
aspect
and
brewed
a
decent
base
tripel
there
is
almost
a
plasticy
note
to
the
flavors
eh
i
didnt
really
enjoy
it
but
it
was
drinkable
enough
this
interesting
beer
appears
a
hazy
straw
hue
with
a
somewhat
smallish
head
and
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
spices
hops
much
more
present
than
in
a
normal
tripel
and
lemon
zest
the
beer
tastes
pretty
decent
but
not
great
there
is
a
slightly
weird
flavor
that
lingers
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
pretty
average
brew
im
not
sure
hoppy
and
tripel
are
a
good
marriage
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
use
caution
the
abv
will
catch
up
with
you
d
all
of
the
pretty
things
beers
i
have
tried
have
been
very
drinkable
save
for
this
one
it
just
felt
too
harsh
next
ill
pair
with
a
strong
stinky
cheese
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
clean
with
good
carbonation
taste
starts
sweet
as
expected
but
with
a
pleasant
balancing
hoppiness
on
the
flipside
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
and
silky
smooth
with
quite
easy
drinkability
esp
for
the
abv
worth
the
trouble
to
find
luckily
i
have
to
expend
little
effort
to
get
yay
for
me
d
i
liked
this
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
not
sure
id
reach
for
a
hoppy
tripel
very
often
still
i
admire
the
effort
and
this
came
together
surprisingly
well
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
with
a
tight
white
head
that
settled
into
a
solid
ring
the
aroma
has
a
nice
belgian
yeast
aroma
some
banana
and
clove
with
honey
and
candi
sugar
notes
not
much
hop
pick
up
in
the
aroma
light
but
seems
spot
on
for
the
style
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
sweet
tropical
fruit
note
some
citrus
floral
honey
and
light
clove
the
sweet
transitions
rather
abruptly
into
an
astringent
chalky
bitterness
from
the
hops
cant
say
that
it
is
very
pleasant
luckily
it
is
not
too
strong
the
feel
is
light
with
tingly
carbonation
the
hops
give
an
odd
chalky
feel
not
typically
present
in
tripels
abv
seems
well
hidden
an
average
tripel
the
actual
tripel
flavors
were
actually
pretty
good
but
i
didnt
really
care
for
what
the
hops
brought
to
the
party
it
made
the
beer
astringent
and
chalky
which
is
not
typical
for
the
style
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
that
lived
up
to
the
hype
that
pretty
things
gets
here
on
beeradvocate
it
was
very
drinkable
and
i
could
definitely
go
for
this
one
again
drink
doesnt
give
the
impression
as
name
states
more
like
a
jackolope
on
steroids
good
crafted
brew
not
reviewers
most
favorite
offering
from
pretty
things
but
well
respected
the
drinkability
is
alright
alcohol
presence
is
definitely
felt
with
a
near
instantaneous
warming
sensation
the
finish
is
a
little
bit
offputting
but
the
light
body
doesnt
make
it
a
chore
to
drink
this
is
a
great
tasting
american
example
of
a
belgian
triple
however
since
it
was
advertised
as
being
a
hoppy
beer
i
expected
a
bit
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
i
guess
i
was
thinking
lots
of
orange
citrus
and
floral
notes
still
if
you
like
belgian
beers
you
have
to
try
this
one
d
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
triple
the
sweetness
is
a
little
much
towards
the
end
though
recommended
but
it
might
be
a
good
one
to
split
picked
up
a
bottle
from
abes
cold
beer
for
7
overall
heck
of
a
beer
the
aroma
is
full
of
herbal
pepper
ad
spice
with
fresh
grains
the
flavor
begins
similarly
with
vanilla
light
caramel
and
fresh
white
bread
hops
slowly
kick
in
with
a
mix
of
floral
citrus
and
orange
rind
to
round
out
a
wellmade
tripel
ill
have
another
the
taste
is
quite
spicy
with
a
lemon
citric
acerbicness
that
is
not
endearing
me
to
this
beer
the
beer
is
a
bit
syrupy
a
bit
sweet
with
a
peppery
spice
on
the
back
end
a
light
malty
underneath
and
a
lemony
tang
that
is
okay
the
coriander
and
spice
really
come
through
with
this
beer
add
to
that
the
yeasty
pricklishness
the
wheaty
qualities
towards
the
finish
the
sweet
but
light
malts
and
you
have
this
beer
pegged
its
is
okay
but
not
brilliant
pours
a
one
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
to

consistent

something
of

in

definitely
a

that
expresses
itself
at

but
not
as
big
i
was
anticipating
overall
the
flavors
have
a
nice

mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
an
assertive
carbonation
that
falls
just
shy
of
prickly
almost
has
a
palate
cleansing
feel
to
it
some
citrus
astringency
comes
out
and
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
in

cheeks
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
maybe
lacking
some
of
the
candi
sugar
notes
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
but
definitely
a
respectable
beer
and
another
solid
offering
from
pretty
things
a
nice
bottle
but
not
necessarily
a
nice
beer
reviewed
from
notes
pours
out
a
hazy
light
yellow
even
green
color
with
a
fluffyfrothy
two
finger
head
that
has
beastly
retention
leaves
thick
lacing
everything
is
great
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
strange
color
the
smell
is
hard
to
get
much
i
do
get
belgian
yeast
notes
like
bread
and
spice
some
citrus
peel
comes
through
as
well
as
some
wheatlike
malt
needs
more
strength
for
sure
taste
is
decent
some
wheatlike
malt
but
it
mostly
just
belgian
yeast
notes
the
spice
notes
are
too
much
for
me
citrus
peel
comes
into
play
but
doesnt
add
much
the
hop
flavor
is
grassy
and
adds
too
much
bitterness
the
balance
is
out
of
whack
on
this
beer
to
me
it
ends
up
just
tasting
like
fancy
soap
with
a
few
redeeming
aspects
the
mouthfeel
needs
work
the
carbonation
and
body
are
lacking
way
too
much
for
such
a
big
beer
it
isnt
creamy
at
all
it
is
just
really
watery
and
lacking
carbonation
there
is
an
oily
aspect
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
either
the
bitter
coat
is
also
just
too
much
drinkability
is
decent
the
price
is
not
worth
it
for
the
quality
of
this
one
a
decent
taste
but
the
mouthfeel
just
kills
it
flavors
end
up
being
out
of
balancetoo
much
and
soapy
the
flavor
is
consistent
with
the
belgian
pale
ale
only
the
alcohol
warmth
in
the
swallow
gives
away
the
potency
of
this
brew
lots
of
citrus
and
light
malt
flavor
good
sourness
from
the
aforementioned
yeast
its
not
an
everyday
beer
but
it
is
tasty
d
fresh
and
full
flavored
with
a
refreshing
quality
flavors
need
to
balance
out
a
bit
more
so
i
would
recommend
letting
this
one
sit
and
age
for
a
bit
a
really
interesting
beer
extremely
hoppy
tripe
pretty
much
sums
it
up
a
great
american
interpretation
of
this
style
not
as
complex
as
some
traditional
tripels
but
that
is
made
up
by
the
lovely
bouquet
of
floral
and
earthiness
presented
by
the
abundance
of
hops
love
what
this
brewery
is
doing
this
is
a
good
attempt
at
a
triple
and
im
happy
to
drink
all
things
that
are
pretty
like
these
white
rabbits
i
could
of
polished
off
the
bomber
easy
at
8
5
but
the
sweetness
would
have
dragged
on
me
seeing
how
this
is
a
hoppy
triple
i
say
drink
up
unless
you
want
more
sweetness
without
the
trademark
ripe
fruit
from
belgian
triples
d
very
nice
stuff
with
a
ton
of
flavor
and
very
drinkable
but
i
guess
thats
why
we
are
here
another
good
beer
from
some
good
heads
this
tripel
pours
a
hazy
gold
into
my
chalice
with
beautiful
lacing
that
suggests
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
there
are
citrus
peppery
aromas
that
characterize
a
typical
belgian
this
one
also
has
a
candylike
smell
to
it
the
taste
reveals
a
complex
welldeveloped
brew
here
with
zesty
citrus
and
bready
notes
the
yeasts
run
wild
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
not
heavy
at
all
for
a
tripel
the
rabbits
are
too
drinkable
as
this
one
got
quaffed
with
the
quickness
the
project
gets
an
a
this
is
one
of
the
better
belgians
i
have
enjoyed
d
moderately
high
another
winner
from
pretty
things
very
impressive
took
my
time
with
it
and
onell
do
me
for
now
but
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
on
a
hot
ri
day
this
was
just
what
i
craved
bomber

quite

finish
well
done
and
quite
refreshingly
enjoyable
better
then
average
american
style
take
on
the
classic
style
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
this
is
an
incredible
beer
if
you
have
access
to
pretty
things
beers
be
sure
to
grab
a
bottle
of
these
before
they
are
all
gone
d
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
beer
and
ill
be
drinking
it
again
i
did
enjoy
this
and
it
did
match
with
our
easter
celebration
tone
down
the
sweetness
a
bit
and
youd
have
a
great
beer
overall
another
win
from
pretty
things
they
take
style
guidelines
and
throw
them
out
the
window
this
is
kinda
like
a
tripel
and
a
belgian
pale
ale
combined
it
creates
a
very
complex
refreshing
tasty
and
original
brew
well
done
sorry
for
the
deviation
from
my
normal
format
but
i
love
this
f
not
too
bitter
i
was
expecting
more
bitterness
here
a
looong
lingering
orange
flavor
like
biting
into
a
fresh
orange
with
that
more
citrus
and
orange
peel
a
little
sticky
sweetness
leftover
but
dries
off
mostly
a
slight
light
body
feel
on
the
mouth
as
if
it
left
the
tongue
feeling
lighter
than
it
started
for
some
reason
overall
a
nice
tripel
with
lots
of
citrus
orange
and
bitter
citrus
not
as
much
on
the
hops
as
i
would
have
expected
from
the
label
but
then
again
im
probably
wicked
jaded
on
hops
from
all
the
crazy
dipas
ive
had
and
i
know
dann
doesnt
load
up
on
the
hops
usually
on
tap
at
the
dive
bar
worcester
served
in
a
tulip
glass
thin
whispy
white
head
cloudy
yellow
body
smell
reminded
me
of
lemongrass
and
crushed
coriander
taste
was
excellent
on
the
one
hand
it
had
that
great
sugary
belgian
tripel
flavor
but
then
you
cant
help
but
notice
the
great
hop
flavor
that
balances
everything
off
nicely
neither
dominates
the
other
they
just
work
perfectly
together
mouthfeel
was
spot
on
for
a
great
belgian
style
ale
just
enough
body
and
noticeable
alcohol
presence
a
great
new
offering
from
pretty
things
its
nice
to
see
pt
beers
other
than
jack
dor
on
tap
around
now
taste
is
goya
tropical
juice
up

with
spicy
backup
white
pepper
grassy
hop
resin
adds
flavor
and
mouthfeel
dry
dry
super
dry
aftertaste
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
if
spring
ever
comes
to
boston
id
have
another
carbonation
is
light
for
the
style
and
a
lingering
metallic
tinge
kind
of
detracts
copperish
in
nature
fluffy
white
rabbits
is
dry
and
mediumbodied
with
an
appropriate
medium
amount
of
carbonation
i
stupidly
forgot
to
write
down
the
abv
but
it
crisp
refreshing
not
at
all
boozey
and
goes
down
easily
this
beer
is
an
excellent
tripel
as
it
stays
true
to
the
style
but
offers
some
nice
surprises
this
is
a
motherfucker
of
a
beer
as
far
as
style
goes
it
is
very
fair
to
call
this
a
tripel
because
the
hops
do
not
muddle
any
of
the
flavors
that
a
great
tripel
should
display
even
if
you
call
this
a
belgoamerican
ipa
its
on
point
im
just
going
to
call
it
something
i
will
look
forward
to
every
spring
d
nice
light
refreshing
great
flavor
well
balanced
this
is
another
damn
solid
offering
from
pretty
things
another
easter
time
beer
from
the
pretty
things
very
cool
artwork
as
always
color
is
a
radiant
hazed
gold
making
this
tulip
glass
look
very
nice
about
a
finger
of
white
head
shows
up
and
sticks
around
for
the
duration
the
smell
is
dominated
by
fruit
notes
such
as
pear
and
green
apple
more
bright
juicy
fruit
comes
through
in
the
taste
along
with
the
big
hop
presence
and
dry
champagne
like
finish
mouthfeel
is
right
smack
dab
in
the
middle
and
perfectly
carbonated
for
this
style
the
more
you
drink
the
more
you
can
notice
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
this
beer
gives
off
putting
back
this
bomber
will
be
no
problem
on
my
end
this
is
a
high
quality
tripel
that
could
not
get
much
fresher
as
it
was
brewed
this
month
cheers
to
dan
and
martha
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
carbonation
is
a
good
amount
less
than
some
but
with
a
bubbly
texture
in
the
mouth
still
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
this
all
day
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
and
it
is
beautifully
balanced
with
the
hops
malty
tripel
backbone
and
the
yeasty
esters
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
beer
before
it
leaves
the
shelves
o
phenol
qualities
detracting
from
an
otherwise
pleasant
flavourful
delicious
beer
overall
a
very
good
flavorful
tripel
with
a
harsh
alcohol
feel
and
slightly
too
spicy
for
my
taste
o
as
my
first
tripel
la
trappe
tripel
was
incredibly
satisfying
make
sure
you
set
aside
an
evening
where
you
can
sit
and
experience
this
ale
fully
like
many
quality
brews
high
abv
can
really
sneak
up
on
you
and
thats
especially
true
with
this
one
its
sold
in
a
750
ml
bottle
o
would
classify
this
as
one
of
my
favorite
triples
slight
sweetness
is
a
perfect
balance
from
the
typically
dry
flavor
of
many
other
authentic
versions
there
is
a
hint
of
the
same
yeast
profile
as
their
quad
aftertaste
is
very
similar
and
distinct
not
my
favorite
tripel
better
options
elsewhere
from
750ml

pours
a
hazy
darker
orange
two
fingers
of

white
head
settles
to
a
thin
but
dense
cap
with
big
blobs
of
lace
halfway
down
the
glass
smell
notes
of
plum
and
pear
bready
mildly
peppery
with
a
note
of
clove
taste
juicy
pear
some
apricot
jam
snappy
grain
pepper
lightly
grassy
clove
note
bubblegummy
in
there
towards
the
end
carbonation
is
a
little
over
aggressive
pretty
nice
no
doubt
this
is
an
authentic
triple
has
all
the
flavors
i
associate
with
this
style
and
a
nice
complexity
if
you
are
a
fan
of
triples
this
one
is
a
must
try
thin
head
on
tap
at
rattlen
hum
nyc
not
much
under
the
nose
or
on
the
side
of
the
glass
but
thats
all
cosmetic
the
taste
is
just
fine
none
too
sweet
as
some
triples
can
be
in
this
very
creamy
beer
the
carbonation
is
a
little
above
average
and
the
body
is
just
a
hair
below
fullbodied
and
solid
tripel
o
this
one
is
only
so
so
it
is
not
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
is
not
the
best
triple
coming
out
of
the
netherlands
that
said
it
is
still
a
lot
better
than
many
triples
from
belgium
and
so
it
deserves
more
than
an
average
score
all
around
great
in
my
opinion
a
perfect
example
of
a
beautiful
belgian
style
triple
overall
a
big
potent
filling
brew
with
lots
of
flavour
would
recommend
to
any
beer
lover
who
hasnt
tried
before
surprised
to
find
id
rated
this
poorly
the

this

a
chalice
glass
cheers
to
my
buddy
woody
for
the
beer
it
pours
a
medium
brown
gold
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
smells
of
bread
dough
and
honey
the
taste
is
bready
with
a
quick
whack
of
cinnamon
does
cinnamon
come
in
whacks
there
is
also
a
slight
earthy
flavor
with
a
really
nice
aftertaste
that
just
makes
you
want
to
have
another
sip
it
is
a
straightforward
tripel
not
like
the
westmalle
but
very
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
tingly
and
buttery
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
it
is
very
good
in
a
very
simple
way
ive
been
called
worse
so
i

served
in

very
nice
a

a

fall
right

my
conceptualizations
of
light

but
the
malt
and
alcohol
are
pretty
strong
those
flavors
are
all
there
but
there
is
no
real
harmony
in
them
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
a
little
creamy
as
well
with
the
lack
of
balance
the
drinkability
suffers
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had
i
like
it
better
than
the
dubbel
but
id
still
pik
other
beers
over
this
one
pours
an
amberorange
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
disappears
sweet
aroma
fruity
and
maybe
some
caramel
the
flavor
is
sweet
like
the
nose
with
some
fruityness
spicy
too
alcohol
is
obvious
and
the
strong
malts
are
not
as
well
balanced
as
i
feel
they
should
be
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
i
think
it
could
be
better
sidenote
same
brewery
different
beer
i
wasnt
sure
if
ba
was
going
to
rollover
this
beers
credentails
after
branding
issues
notes
they
have
this
beer
at
a
local
grocery
store
i
pick
it
up
on
occasion
but
i
dont
know
if
anyone
else
is
buying
it
i
have
no
idea
how
long
the
bottles
have
been
there
but
i
suspect
that
theyre
not
brewery
fresh
in
fact
i
suspect
that
theyre
fairly
old
and
that
the
age
has
given
this
beer
a
lot
of
character
i
intend
on
cellaring
a
few
of
these
and
see
how
they
turn
out
in
a
few
years
very
accessible
and
unlikely
to
offend
sweettoothed
novices
this
beer
is
just
lacking
the
wild
memorable
charm
of
a
qualitytrappiststyle
beer
still
considering
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
why
rant
overall
impression
so
happy
with
this
little
windfall
the
case
seems
to
have
been
treated
well
and
i
may
put
a
few
bottles
back
for
a
bit
more
maturing
high
points
are
a
full
rich
flavor
and
aroma
down
sides
would
be
hard
to
find
but
appearance
and
drinkability
are
closer
to
average
a
solid
tripel
in
my
book
fantastic
session
brew
for
me
fruity
malty
and
a
very
good
belgian
trippel
alcohol
hidden
well
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
with
tons
of
malt
slight
hop
notes
very
smooth
and
highly
quaffable
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
wishing
to
try
a
belgian
style
beer
without
getting
into
the
heavy
hitters
too
soon
smooth
as
silk
light
carbonation
a
great
body
it
just
floats
in
the
mouth
a
delightful
treat
which
is
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
has
a
very
balanced
flavor
and
is
great
for
repeat
drinking
this
was
an
interesting
tripel
poured
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
looked
a
little
darker
than
some
other
tripels
out
there
smell
consisted
of
fruits
and
nutty
aromas
taste
was
good
nice
and
crisp
lots
of
fruits
in
there
plums
grapes
some
apple
perhaps
its
also
more
fruitier
than
other
tripels
on
the
market
pretty
nice
brew
it
has
a
lot
of
character
and
its
fullbodied
worth
seeking
out
beautiful
appearance
a
very
dense
and
fine
head
on
a
orange
copper
hazy
body
nice
aromas
of
ripe
bananas
and
citrus
the
taste
is
very
fruity
ripe
bananas
almost
with
an
artifical
candy
flavor
and
mostly
grapefruit
the
hops
are
well
hidden
and
add
a
subtle
floral
note
to
the
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
round
but
gets
dry
and
citric
on
the
end
as
the
alcohol
gets
more
noticeable
an
enjoyable
tripel
as
far
as
i
know
this
was
one
of
the
last
bottles
of
this
beer
sold
in
the
united
states
after
the
brewery
closed
some
time
ago
presented
in
a
750ml
bottle
with
wirecaged
champagne
cork
pours
a
brilliant
golden
amber
with
a
huge
offwhite
creamy
head
big
aroma
of
banana
and
apricot
that
hits
from
several
feet
away
closer
sniffing
reveals
clove
and
a
hint
offkey
mustiness
that
makes
me
think
i
may
have
let
this
one
sit
just
a
little
too
long
beautiful
carbonation
the
tiny
champagne
bubbles
just
keep
on
coming
buttery
creamy
body
is
as
close
to
perfection
as
i
can
imagine
palate
holds
light
sweet
fruit
brown
sugar
bubble
gum
and
a
hint
of
amaretto
nice
sweet
finish
with
very
little
aftertaste
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
im
sad
to
see
this
one
go
12oz
bottle
with
some
date
code
i
cant
understand
poured
a
cloudy
reddish
orange
with
sizable
head
that
falls
flat
yet
leaves
scattered
lacing
aroma
has
a
candy
like
sweetness
to
it
with
some
fruit
and
yeast
adding
to
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
the
flavor
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
peppery
spicy
note
added
to
the
sugary
sweetness
overall
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
a
decent
one
just
the
same
okay
for
sipping
not
one
id
want
to
put
away
a
ton
off
a
little
too
sweet
without
really
distinguishing
itself
in
any
other
way
from
the
pour
the
brownishorange
color
attracted
me
that
along
with
the
light
foamy
head
that
remained
on
top
throughout
the
glass
this
ale
had
one
of
the
fruitiest
smells
i
have
ever
experienced
definite
hints
of
apples
with
another
smell
i
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
to
me
this
is
where
the
outstanding
parts
of
this
drink
end
the
start
is
very
wet
and
underhopped
for
my
taste
anyway
the
middle
is
borderline
tart
with
a
finish
almost
like
that
of
apple
juice
this
is
a
fine
beer
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
a
golden
amber
pour
with
a
medium
but
rich
white
head
the
nose
is
smeisweet
with
bubblegum
hints
and
a
noticeable
yest
quality
light
fruit
notes
as
well
the
taste
is
well
balance
with
once
again
the
bubblegum
sweetness
and
light
fruit
notes
did
i
detect
a
pinch
of
coconut
anyway
the
taste
reminds
me
somewhat
of
leffe
blond
based
on
memory
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
full
lots
of
lively
bubbles
the
whole
way
through
with
a
dryish
finish
an
easy
drinker
but
not
overly
complex
or
fullfilling
biggish
light
creamytancolored
coarse
head
thin
arcs
and
spotty
lacing
dark
orangeyamber
beer
the
smell
is
sweet
malty
a
touch
corky
with
a
little
sugar
alcohol
obvious
in
the
front
poking
through
the
caramel
thick
malt
in
the
middle
sweet
creamy
dry
finish
some
tartnesssourness
this
is
very
tasty
but
short
of
the
quad
not
a
real
impressive
pour
here
kind
of
hazy
deep
orange
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
ofthe
aroma
is
somewhat
winey
and
spicey
with
some
light
apple
notes
tjhid
one
hefty
triple
here
very
rich
tasting
some
deep
wine
noted
and
very
yeasty
tasting
with
some
sharp
spiciness
one
of
the
harshest
triples
i
hav
had
in
quite
awhile
although
thats
not
a
total
bad
thing
smooth
on
the
tongue
slight
dryness
experienced
after
swallowing
the
malt
flavor
lasts
for
a
minute
or
so
too
definitely
drinkable
the
alcohol
level
is
not
very
noticable
compared
to
other
belgian
tripels
overall
a
fine
belgian
triple
poured
a
slightly
hazy
peach
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
was
tight
so
i
was
able
to
get
a
very
clean
decant
flavor
is
soft
some
suggestion
of
honeydew
melon
with
a
sharp
carbonated
acidity
that
balances
well
not
a
lot
of
depth
to
the
flavor
profile
but
overall
it
is
quite
pleasant
nice
somewhat
hazy
golden
orange
color
competently
sized
off
white
head
with
oodles
of
fine
lace
ripe
fruit
aromas
like
pineapple
and
over
ripe
banana
dominate
the
nose
with
malt
tones
underlying
it
all
start
is
ambrosial
reedy
top
slightly
tart
middling
carbonation
with
a
masterful
hop
spicy
bite
the
aftertaste
dry
and
also
a
lingering
tartness
through
the
drink
nice
opaque
deep
golden
darkened
yellow
color
a
lighter
peachy
tone
that
has
lots
of
little
floaty
things
suspended
in
its
haze
small
whitish
head
thats
loose
and
fluffy
and
fades
pretty
fast
and
lace
is
in
drippy
strings
and
spots
smell
is
a
subdued
mellow
mix
of
very
dulled
melons
and
lemon
with
some
yeasty
grab
and
a
nice
spicyness
and
alcoholic
warmth
over
lays
taste
is
quite
quenchingly
yummy
and
mellowing
nice
mild
citrus
of
dullish
lemon
melons
and
dried
orange
and
apricot
all
have
a
certain
impressionable
mix
and
lightly
souring
tartness
kick
thats
mostly
upfront
hops
add
to
the
boost
some
then
it
begins
to
fade
some
as
it
reaches
farther
past
midway
just
after
midway
it
mellows
out
with
some
spicyness
and
lingering
lightly
into
the
finish
with
some
malty
chewyness
and
more
dulled
citrus
mix
solid
medium
body
feel
with
some
creamyness
at
first
picking
up
a
small
surge
on
its
way
to
a
mellowing
smooth
and
lightly
chewy
sweet
finish
not
overly
complex
but
very
enjoyable
a
nice
drinkable
thickness
and
lush
feeling
as
it
begins
to
warm
after
half
a
glass
or
so
makes
for
a
nice
relaxing
glass
full
of
delight
this
triple
pours
a
respectable
full
head
that
diminishes
quickly
but
leaves
a
creamy
lace
that
maintains
to
the
end
clinging
slightly
its
tones
are
a
rose
gold
with
a
hazy
translucence
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
caramel
with
a
distinctive
freshness
that
hints
of
melon
an
exceptional
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
not
overwhelming
and
not
boring
a
hazy
deep
marmalade
body
is
topped
by
a
creamy
head
of
offwhite
foam
the
retention
is
excellent
and
it
maintains
a
creamy
12
surface
covering
throughout
the
entire
goblet
and
leaves
short
walls
of
lace
that
drop
with
the
level
of
the
beer
but
dont
stick
the
aroma
displays
a
clean
lightly
honeyish
malt
thats
accentuated
by
a
light
fruitiness
and
gently
floral
background
hops
in
the
mouth
its
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
very
fine
restrained
natural
carbonation
and
solidly
medium
body
delicate
sweetish
malt
dominates
the
flavor
but
gives
a
burst
of
light
fruit
at
the
swallow
it
finishes
surprisingly
dry
considering
the
candyish
malt
with
a
lowkey
bitterness
and
some
grassy
hop
flavor
becoming
evident
its
exceptionally
well
balanced
and
quite
enjoyable
though
it
lacks
a
little
bit
of
complexity
still
its
well
worth
trying
this
brew
pours
a
large
invigorated
light
brown
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
bubbles
it
has
a
cloudy
dark
orangebrown
body
full
of
yeast
its
aroma
is
a
very
pleasant
yeasty
peach
smell
its
flavor
is
full
bodied
and
chewy
with
hints
of
spice
and
fruit
intensity
of
alcohol
causes
it
to
be
a
slow
sipper
but
it
smooths
out
as
warms
which
lends
to
enjoyment
but
then
it
loses
some
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
pillowy
soft
and
the
flavor
is
near
perfect
a
perfect
blend
of
semidry
maltiness
with
a
super
pleasant
and
non
aggressive
hoppiness
the
after
flavor
is
more
of
a
nutmeghops
as
well
very
good
very
very
good

nearly
a
perfect
excellent
beer
this
brew
poured
a
large
creamy
thick
head
that
was
long
lasting
there
was
lacing
on
sides
of
my
glass
the
aroma
was
fruity
and
spicy
the
body
was
an
orangish
color
it
had
a
bitter
taste
to
it
it
also
had
a
slight
aftertaste
to
it
it
had
a
cloudy
appearance
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
brew
this
beer
pours
a
clear
darkish
amber
color
with
a
large
creamy
clingy
tan
head
the
mouthfeel
is
firm
the
smell
is
of
bay
leaves
and
is
slightly
breadlike
the
taste
is
earthy
bay
leaves
with
a
fruitiness
and
candy
sugar
type
sweetness
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
that
lacks
the
complexity
of
a
lot
of
other
triples
the
presentationin
an
earthenware
corked
bottle
is
actually
more
impressive
than
the
beer
itself
though
its
not
fair
to
compare
with
an
aged
sample
this
newer
version
does
not
compare
to
what
i
remember
from
fresher
versions
possibly
the
most
exhausting
cork
ive
ever
wrestled
with
i
thought
for
a
minute
that
i
was
actually
going
to
need
a
pair
of
pliers
to
get
the
thing
out
once
opened
it
pours
a
hazy
deep
orange
amber
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
offwhite
colored
head
and
lots
of
visible
active
carbonation
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
fresh
fruit
with
an
almost
cakelike
aroma
medium
in
body
with
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
taste
is
sweet
fruits
up
front
followed
by
some
notes
of
bread
pudding
and
peppery
hops
a
very
enjoyable
tripel
the
euro
style
11
2
ounce
bottle
seems
thick
enough
to
use
as
a
weapon
for
such
a
slender
item
this
my
first
tripel
out
of
excitement
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
foamy
bright
white
head
smell
is
initially
of
fresh
flowers
the
taste
is
initially
chewy
with
me
craving
more
but
only
in
sips
has
a
very
sweet
taste
with
just
a
tinge
of
fruit
left
on
the
palate
noticeable
is
the
warming
effect
but
not
much
alcohol
taste
my
first
of
many
tripels
this
beer
poured
a
sort
of
amberorange
color
with
a
small
foamy
head
that
reduced
down
to
a
thin
layer
on
the
top
but
it
did
leave
good
lacing
the
aroma
had
several
different
characteristics
the
citrusbanana
smell
jumped
out
the
most
with
alcohol
spices
and
a
flowery
touch
the
hops
were
also
present
in
the
aroma
after
the
complex
smell
i
was
ready
for
a
complex
taste
but
no
such
luck
the
taste
was
rather
bland
with
none
of
the
aromas
really
jumping
out
in
the
taste
i
guess
the
most
notable
flavor
is
the
hops
sort
of
a
grassy
bittery
taste
but
this
beer
isnt
totally
without
any
malt
flavors
the
aftertase
leaves
a
sort
of
sugary
taste
in
the
mouth
overall
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
to
much
source
european

honeyorangish
in
color
with
an
offwhite

it
leaves
a
slight
lacing
when
sipped
down
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
i
detect
apple
and
raisins
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
apple
to
start
then
somewhat
bready
it
then
fads
to
a
dry
alcoholic
finish
this
is
my
first
sampling
of
a
tripel
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
decent
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
though
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
like
the
dubbel
better
i
have
a
couple
of
750
ml
bottles
of
this
stashed
away
for
as
long
as
i
can
hold
out
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
beer
tastes
like
with
some
time
under
its
belt
la
trappe
trappist

a
belgian
tripel
ale
but
not
made
in

or
at
least
so
i
am
told
pours
a
tannish
brown
fairly
hazy
i
spun
up
some
the
sediment
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
it
came
up
in
thick
chunks
the
head
is
not
impressive
dissipated
very
quickly
cidery
aroma
and
the
flavor
has
some
notes
of
cider
as
well
very
malty
beer
with
some
bready
malts
but
lots
of
dried
fruit
flavors
as
well
such
as
raisons
and
the
like
not
bad
easy
to
drink
but
i
had
a

earlier
this
evening
that
was
loads
better
and
significantly
cheaper

the
taste

noticable
in
the
finish
not

bad

and

never
left
sweet

tastes
dominated
weird

not
near

never

burning
lingers
in
the

a
dissapointment
i
had
their
dubbel
a
while
back
before
becoming
a
ba
and
kept
the
bottle
it
was
so
good
i
was
thrilled
to
see
this
at
store
and
jumped
at
the
chance
to
buy
it
it
was
a
letdown

hint
of

clove
is
more

in

but
remains

it

with

understated

bitterness
leaves
the
flavor
profile
skewed
towards
malt
sweetness
which
unfortunately
consists
of
seemingly
simple
residual
sugars
almost
one
dimensional
in
overall
malt
character
lightly
bodied
and
a
touch
thin
in
mouthfeel
but
this
helps
lend
a
deceiving
lightness
on
the
palate
finishes
w
notes
of
white
bread
sweetness
but
otherwise
clean
la
trappe
tripel
although
fairly
tasty
seemed
too
clean
and
restrained
in
overall
malt
and
yeast
derived
character
its
much
like
their
blonde
albeit
with
a
more
pronounced
alcohol
presence
this
is
not
to
my
liking
appearance
in
glass
is
of
a
very
bad
home
brew
aroma
is
of
yeast
and
very
obvious
taste
is
of
a
caramel
malt
nature
and
stong
if
this
was
the
only
beer
on
earth
i
would
turn
to
wine
somebody
please
hit
me
with
a
stick
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
amber
and
formed
a
bubbly
off
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
herb
and
bread
a
flavor
of
malt
and
citrus
with
a
warming
slight
presence
of
the
alcohol
a
slight
tart
finish
on
a
light
body
brought
on
in
part
no
doubt
to
the
heavy
carbonation
not
a
bad
tripel
mustymalt
smell
with
a
touch
of
yeast
freshness
a
white
head
with
a
touch
of
tan
that
dissapates
into
a
slight
sheen
quite
rapidly
rose
in
color
with
lively
carbonation
slightly
darker
than
most
triples
the
yeastfruit
flavor
dominates
the
tongue
and
is
backed
up
by
a
sweet
malt
base
the
mouth
is
is
lively
with
some
softness
in
the
finish
solid
but
not
a
next
level
selection
this
beer
has
an
amber
color
and
is
topped
with
a
dense
rocky
offwhite
head
phenolic
sour
yeasty
fruity
aroma
taste
includes
alcohol
sour
notes
and
yeast
there
almost
seems
to
be
a
stinging
solventlike
characteristic
also
a
little
off
to
me
some
banana
esters
are
present
the
body
is
about
medium
and
drinkability
is
not
that
great
if
im
looking
for
a
belgian
beer
to
drink
ill
bypass
this
one
the
next
time
probably
not
the
best
tripel
out
there
but
certainly
one
the
most
drinkable
this
would
be
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
style
love
this
beer
have
to
get
it
everytime
im
in
pa
great
aroma
and
taste
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
a
gentle
spicyfruit
taste
invades
your
palatte
especially
nice
on
a
cold
day
or
evening
hazy
amberorange
not
much
sediment
to
work
up
medium
head
and
lacing
big
time
alcoholfruitcake
aroma
awakens
the
senses
full
mouthfeel
definite
belgian
spice
characteristics
like
eating
apple
pie
and
nutmeg
some
clove
and
banana
all
backed
up
by
a
definite
alcohol
presence
lots
of
other
flavors
present
but
im
too
overwhelmed
to
describe
them
id
even
be
more
impressed
if
this
was
december
and
not
july
a
great
beer
notes
more
of
a
laid
back
tripel
resting
at
8
abv
and
with
a
milder
character
than
others
still
a
very
respectable
brew
a
perfect
accompaniment
with
a
goat
cheese
spread
and
whole
wheat
crackers
hazy
pale
orangey
color
thin
head
that
lasts
awhile
vague
aroma
slightly
berry
lacks
the
oomph
of
the
quadrupel
and
has
a
more
pronounced
grapewine
flavor
than
a
berrylike
character
after
taste
is
very
pleasant
refreshing
but
not
super
memorable
within
this
style
but
then
im
only
mildy
a
fan
of
belgian
ales
pours
a
clear
straw
with
a
one
finger
white
rocky
head
that
disappates
quickly
aroma
is
floral
spicy
coriander
and
bready
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
sweetness
bread
spice
coriander
and
a
floral
tonge
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
not
overly
carbonated
overall
a
nice
beer
and
a
style
i
will
enjoy
trying
more
overall
pretty
good
but
not
worth
getting
again
always
like
a
great
trippel
this
one
went
great
with
some
pinwheel
filet
mignonette
so
lets
give
a
whirl
on
the
review
side
popping
the
top
i
get
a
breads
waft
of
spiced
malt
pours
to
a
bright
light
orange
with
a
one
finger
multibubble
head
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
a
breads
candy
and
spice
everything
nice
flavor
is
consistent
throughout
with
a
trace
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
a
great
food
beer
and
sipper
very
good
with
strong
hints
of
hops
the
only
downside
is
youll
buy
it
so
much
youll
get
sick
of
it
cheers
coriander
taste
great
smooth
flavor
one
of
my
favorites
from
new
belgium
trippel
is
a
tripel
style
belgian
ale
that
is
crisp
light
in
appearance
and
delicious
brewed
with
coriander
this
beer
is
strong
and
herbal
bringing
in
palaterefreshing
tones
of
hops
balanced
with
malt
and
earth
not
too
bitter
the
content
of
trippels
abv
is
hidden
by
slight
tones
of
wheat
spices
and
the
traditional
european
ale
flavor
over
time
if
the
beer
sits
it
is
possible
to
taste
a
little
alcoholic
bitterness
but
with
a
true
drinking
of
trippel
it
will
pay
you
back
entirely
this
beer
does
not
deserve
to
be
out
of
the
bottle
for
more
than
a
halfhour
and
it
demands
a
quick
consumption
in
order
to
attain
its
brilliance
this
is
not
one
for
the
new
drinker
this
beer
resides
in
the
halls
of
the
greats
because
of
its
personality
and
vigor
sharp
in
taste
and
all
of
the
ingredients
being
present
this
beer
demands
an
audience
of
great
import
and
knowledge
and
is
likely
to
be
brushed
under
by
novices
in
terms
of
flavor
color
and
presentation
when
you
find
trippel
pick
up
a
pack
and
enjoy
your
night
cause
youll
never
want
to
pass
it
up
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
a
light
clear
golden
with
a
1
finger
white
head
of
foam
lots
of
carbonation
definitely
fresh
smells
of
wheat
pine
citrus
bananas
with
some
slight
hints
of
pineapple
and
grapefruit
unfortunately
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
went
south
for
me
it
literally
tastes
like
liquefied
banana
nut
bread
there
was
some
citrus
and
hoppiness
in
there
but
the
banana
taste
is
just
too
overpowering
for
me
and
ruins
the
rest
of
the
flavors
that
are
present
o
should
be
called
a
banana
nut
beer
i
find
that
most
breweries
have
no
clue
how
to
brew
a
decent
tripel
nb
on
the
other
hand
has
figured
out
exactly
how
to
brew
a
decent
tripel
while
not
going
one
inch
further
this
stuff
is
totally
drinkable
but
also
totally
unremarkable
overall
this
is
a
goto
beer
for
me
you
can
buy
it
year
round
and
it
works
in
any
season
i
have
much
respect
for
it
and
very
little
respect
for
the
fools
who
rate
this
beer
low
because
it
proves
they
dont
know
what
a
good
beer
is
if
you
see
a
low
rating
for
this
beer
the
person
who
wrote
the
review
prefers
budweiser
and
therefore
does
not
enjoy
real
beer
and
shouldnt
be
on
beer
advocate
grab
it
and
thank
me
oh
and
by
the
way
this
beer
has
an
astounding
shelflife
the
six
pack
i
picked
up
is
good
until
october
21
2015
thank
you
new
belgium
and
keep
up
the
good
work
just
not
my
thing
at
all
did
not
do
it
for
me
much
better
out
there
i
love
just
about
everything
else
nb
makes
but
this
doesnt
cut
it
pours
too
clear
for
a
triple
red
lights
go
off
no
real
head
or
lacing
worth
noting
funk
smell
farmhouse
maybe
no
such
luck
on
taste
more
like
a
third
than
a
triple
big
disappointment
way
too
metallic
decent
carbonation
but
who
cares
at
this
point
being
a
big
belgian
abby
triple
fan
id
say
this
is
almost
laughable
would
turn
folks
off
to
the
thought
of
a
triple
bummer
dude
btw
i
fing
love
a
quality
belgian
trippel
how
this
has
a
better
rating
than
left
hands
st
vrain
is
beyond
me
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
have
the
smell
alcohol
content
or
taste
of
higher
quality
tripels
this
is
an
interesting
trippel
freaking
awesome
brew
totally
surprised
by
everything
about
this
beer
good
beer
certainly
more
complex
as
it
warms
overall
interesting
beer
quite
drinkable
however
there
are
much
better
trippels
on
the
market
a
sweet
belgianstyle
ale
that
unfortunately
cant
hold
a
candle
to
the
ones
back
in
europe
not
to
mention
tripels
in
particular
too
syrupy
sweet
overimposed
spiciness
i
might
be
too
harsh
its
decent
but
i
expected
something
smarter
this
tasted
in
between
a
saison
and
a
tripel
the
saison
taste
is
not
my
favorite
nor
is
the
trippel
for
that
matter
so
in
terms
of
my
personal
taste
preferences
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
often
drink
but
it
seems
like
a
wellmade
beer
which
would
be
greatly
enjoyed
by
those
who
love
the
particular
styles
involved
overall
a
decent
trippel
but
not
quite
as
good
as
a
true
belgian
never
been
a
big
fan
of
trippels
but
i
found
this
easy
to
drink
and
lacking
that
awful
clove
light
brew
with
very
thin
head
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
rising
not
much
odor
really
need
to
stick
your
nose
in
to
get
that
trippel
odor
slight
floral
taste
mixed
with
belgan
wheat
alcohol
flavor
bites
you
at
the
end
and
then
fades
into
some
weird
aftertaste
im
not
overly
impressed
if
you
cant
be
in
belgium
this
will
work
pretty
well
to
fill
in
that
gap
this
is
a
great
accessible
tripel
especially
if
youve
never
tried
a
belgian
tripel
its
one
of
my
goto
beers
especially
in
the
summer
great
balance
of
hop
bitterness
and
belgian
yeast
flavor
nice
spiciness
from
the
coriander
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
thick
rocky
offwhite
colored
head
sheet
of
thin
lace
halfway
down
the
glass
smell
grape
apricot
and
floral
notes
pale
malt
sweetness
and
lots
of
coriander
taste
sugary
malt
character
mildly
fruity
pearapplegrape
juice
blend
again
coriander
overload
lightly
spicy
hopping
some
peach
skin
in
the
finish
along
with
spiced
sugar
cookie
this
is
the
lasting
impression
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
flavor
of
some
others
and
i
could
do
with
a
lot
less
coriander
but
this
is
pretty
nice
at
this
abv
and
price
it
fills
the
mouth
but
isnt
so
heavy
that
its
hard
to
finish
it
takes
both
my
favorite
sides
i
like
of
a
lighter
or
heavier
beer
i
also
enjoy
the
sweet
herbalcitrus
taste
at
the
end
and
like
the
sour
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
here
at
the
house
nice
fruity
aroma
taste
of
coriander
and
spice
beautiful
golden
color
great
finish
good
with
all
kinds
of
food
highly
recommended
for
those
whod
like
to
go
beyond
fat
tire
but
arent
ready
to
try
the
saison
offerings
from
nb
buy
more
that
coriander
though
for
a
larger
brewer
it
is
very
good
excellent
trippel
usually
i
feel
obligated
to
stick
with
the
texas
companies
but
when
i
tried
new
belgiums
trippel
i
decided
i
would
never
go
back
to
devils
backbone
my
longtime
favorite
tripel
new
belgium
really
came
up
with
something
good
with
this
ale
its
bright
fairly
hoppy
though
as
always
i
could
use
more
hops
lol
has
good
abv
and
sophisticated
nonoffensive
aftertastes
including
some
flavors
i
find
unique
to
this
brew
highly
recommend
this
beer
its
well
made
has
great
taste
and
packs
a
punch
no
complaints
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
two
finger
head
that
left
beautiful
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
light
and
i
couldnt
quite
place
it
but
coriander
as
the
label
suggested
was
there
along
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
banana
of
all
things
the
taste
was
pleasantly
different
with
banana
and
coriander
prevalence
along
with
hops
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
definitely
a
fridge
item
when
one
craves
something
light
refreshing
and
different
careful
though
the
taste
belies
the
7
80abv
rating
this
was
my
first
trippel
so
im
no
expert
here
the
first
taste
was
very
floral
and
citrusy
then
i
noticed
the
alcohol
content
sink
in
and
finally
the
coriander
came
through
a
translucent
golden
body
sat
underneath
a
small
12
finger
white
head
great
lacing
in
my
12
oz
glass
and
zero
floaties
in
the
body
not
an
anytime
beer
but
well
worth
the
experience
not
sure
about
the
age
of
my
bottle
the
coriander
only
showed
up
towards
the
middle
of
the
beer
and
was
gone
before
i
got
much
further
a
good
beer
id
have
again
with
no
objections
but
not
one
id
choose
over
many
others
either

this
is
a
pretty
accurate
take
on
a
belgian
tripel
style
of
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
if
im
going
with
a
true
belgian
from
this
brewery
though
give
me
an
abbey
any
day
of
the
week
maybe
im
not
as
big
a
coriander
fan
i
dont
know
but
while
i
didnt
dislike
this
by
any
means
i
liked
abbey
a
lot
more
different
strokes
for
different
folks
i
guess
though
ill
say
its
very
nice
to
have
this
in
a
sixpack
and
available
all
year
long
whereas
most
similar
beers
are
only
packaged
in
bombers
and
harder
to
find
this
accessibility
is
definitely
a
plus
for
new
belgium
overall

i
am
not
upset
i
purchased
a
six
pack
of
this
i
do
not
like
it
quite
as
much
as
abbey
due
to
the
strong
alcohol
astringency
it
does
not
ruin
the
whole
beer
however
and
i
can
overlook
that
small
feat
to
enjoy
a
beer
that
is
utterly
yummy
light
fruity
aroma
smooth
body
with
medium
malts
light
wheat
and
hints
of
spice

this
is
a
really
great
trippel
given
the
low
price
it
gives
you
about
as
much
bang
for
your
buck
as
you
can
possibly
get
in
bottled
craft
beer
o
now
that
i
think
of
it
this
tastes
very
much
like
golden
monkey
with
a
touch
more
depth
and
hardness
in
flavor
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
could
see
grabbing
a
sixpack
once
or
twice
a
year
if
they
sold
it
in
my
state
4
27
poured
a
deep
clear
gold
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
the
head
has
minor
retention
but
leaves
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
reminiscent
of
banana
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
has
the
characteristics
of
a
trippel
but
is
somewhat
muted
by
comparison
there
isnt
a
huge
amount
of
fruity
esters
or
spice
theyre
there
but
not
prominent
the
body
has
a
nice
weight
on
the
palate
not
too
heavy
or
too
watery
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
market
appears
to
have
passed
it
by
o
good
balanced
trippel
all
around
alcohol
is
well
masking
balanced
fruitiness
driven
by
the
coriander
i
am
not
going
to
go
into
the
details
of
appearance
aroma
etc
etc
for
this
beer
it
has
had
to
be
had
to
experience
it
it
is
the
pliny
the
elder
of
trippels
of
all
beers
in
my
book
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
i
definitely
did
not
expect
this
from
new
belgium
a
solid
beer
although
a
bit
too
heavy
for
style
great
flavor
and
well
worth
trying
just
dont
expect
it
to
be
a
good
companion
for
a
hot
day
o
new
belgium
has
always
done
pretty
well
with
the
belgian
styles
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
this
beer
has
great
flavors
and
solid
balance
coriander
and
spices
in
the
smell
and
taste
good
color
clear
and
perfect
golden
clear
not
much
of
a
fan
of
trippels
yet
reminds
me
again
of
ciders
or
champagne
dry
after

no
alcohol
taste
what
so
ever
which
is
good
almost
has
a
sticky
mouth
feel
after
a
couple
sips
now
i
get
an
alcohol
warming
sensation
nothing
really
popping
out
for
me
though
this
beer
would
be
good
at
a
campfire
or
fireside
sharing
it
with
somebody
maybe
your
dog
or
who
ever
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
reasonably
priced
its
not
the
best
ive
had
for
the
style
but
for
the
price
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
again
i
am
not
a
belgian
fan
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
would
recommend
it
the
beer
poured
a
clear
orange
with
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
carries
typical
belgian
flare
with
coriander
spice
the
taste
is
also
typical
of
most
belgians
but
this
is
very
well
balanced
with
decent
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
solid
for
any
belgian
fan
slightly
excessive
pilsener
grain
flavor
it
dominates
both
the
nose
and
first
sips
of
this
beer
nose
is
even
slightly
skunky
but
in
the
end
opens
up
it
didnt
occur
to
me
to
use
an
aerator
during
the
pour
but
that
may
have
helped
stay
with
this
one
it
opens
up
the
malty
sweetness
prevails
in
the
end
even
close
to
room
temperature
this
beer
is
a
drinker
a
gentle
complex
balanced
beer
beer
was
poured
in
to
a
belgianstyle
beer
glass
poured
into
a
pint
glass
good
appears
to
be
natural
carbonation
straw
color
with
the
malt
coriander
nose
hops
are
a
little
subdued
i
would
put
this
in
same
as
palm
duvel
category
quite
good
and
will
have
another
reminds
me
of
the
monksbrau
we
have
had
tripel
yes
looks
like
they
put
some
thought
into
this
one
the
trippel
tastes
just
like
a
duvel
it
has
a
nice
golden
color
medium
head
high
carbonation
smells
a
little
like
nuts
and
bread
and
a
little
floral
it
tastes
hoppy
some
spicy
with
an
orange
like
flavor
like
the
duvel
it
is
a
beer
made
for
the
masses
no
explosion
of
belgian
flavors
or
anything
to
say
wow
about
one
of
the
best
tripels
out
there
overall
trippel
isnt
great
as
a
a
tripel
but
it
is
fairly
drinkable
and
the
taste
isnt
bad
at
all
on
the
other
hand
the
aroma
mouthfeel
and
color
are
somewhat
lacking
splitting
the
decision
is
the
alcohol
content
which
is
listed
at
7
8
but
is
masked
quite
well
i
give
it
a
solid
b
this
is
my
first
trippel
and
i
am
impressed
the
beer
poured
nicely
with
34
long
lasting
head
it
leaves
very
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
just
wonderful
like
sweet
cloves
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
it
starts
out
sweet
with
a
touch
of
banana
then
finishes
with
a
mild
spiciness
it
is
nice
to
find
a
beer
with
a
mild
sweetness
but
not
too
heavy
of
a
body
i
would
call
this
a
medium
bodied
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
definitely
be
buying
some
more
lacks
the
light
character
and
is
far
more
bitter
than
most
examples
of
the
style
not
as
complex
as
most
i
like
the
pear
character
the
esters
are
nice
just
somewhat
onenote
more
bitter
than
i
prefer
overall
drinkability
very
tasty
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
but
it
more
than
makes
up
for
this
in
flavor
and
drinkability
i
wish
i
had
another
one
right
now
or
at
least
a
bigger
bottle
dangerously
drinkable
higher
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
paired
well
with
indian
food
vegetable
rogan
jhosh
and
i
suspect
it
would
pair
well
with
other
food
as
well
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
again
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
and
less
carbonated
than
other
tripels
that
i
enjoy
just
not
enough
activity
on
the
tongue
overall
its
a
decent
tripel
but
not
something
that
blew
me
away
if
im
in
the
mood
i
may
reach
back
out
again
but
will
probably
go
for
others
instead
p
s
my
bottle
purchased
in
april
2014
has
a
different
label
under
the
new
belgium
logo
there
are
three
roosters
pictured
on
the
label
overall
outstanding
especially
for
the
price
range
overall
an
easy
to
drink
tripel
though
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
trippel
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
long
lasting
lacing
head
there
is
a
a
rich
and
spicy
aroma
hints
of
coriander
lots
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
crisp
good
noticeable
amount
of
spices
hints
of
orange
good
malt
backbone
nice
flavors
a
tad
bit
weak
overall
its
not
as
rich
as
other
trippels
but
has
a
very
nice
crisp
fruity
flavor
new
belgium
trippel
45
overall
i
had
this
once
before
and
enjoyed
though
i
didnt
rate
admittedly
i
am
rating
this
after
having
it
on
the
same
day
as
la
fin
du
monde
so
my
rating
may
be
skewed
will
try
again
this
spring
d
this
is
a
rather
nice
and
refreshing
trippel
with
good
balance
to
it
but
it
is
also
somewhat
unmemorable
i
would
think
if
your
brewery
is
the
new
belgium
you
would
want
to
take
extra
care
on
this
style
to
make
it
special
just
my
02
however
but
id
recommend
their
abbey
dubbel
if
youre
looking
to
find
a
top
notch
american
belgian
o
excellent
brew
looks
beautiful
the
aromas
hit
me
the
second
i
started
pouring
and
the
flavor
blew
me
away
will
be
getting
more
of
these
lovely
golden
pour
with
a
clear
glowing
body
and
a
load
of
very
fine
champagne
like
bubbles
forming
a
frothy
head
the
smell
was
wheaty
and
yeasty
with
bananas
and
clove
being
quite
noticeable
the
aroma
of
coriander
could
also
be
perceived
upon
deeper
breaths
the
taste
was
fruity
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
just
a
perfect
balance
of
spice
added
a
dryness
to
the
finish
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
tingly
sensation
due
to
carbonation
this
new
belgium
showing
some
of
their
best
craft
i
love
it
enjoy
overall
good
nothing
special
but
a
decent
gateway
belgian
style
beer
for
nascent
beer
drinkers
final
thoughts
yet
another
nb
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
yet
nice
abv
at
7
8
good
price
on
a
sixer
at
around
8
and
always
tastes
great
and
i
am
not
even
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
when
its
done
well
its
done
well
a
seemingly
american
take
on
the
style
up
front
but
those
appearances
soon
drop
away
leaving
us
with
an
ok
in
bearing
and
not
really
as
complex
mimicry
of
the
oldworld
masters
agreeable
enough
i
suppose
given
its
apparent
availability
in
bottle
format
around
its
point
of
origin
just
not
up
here
tho
yet
overall
i
am
always
happy
with
new
belgium
beers
they
are
a
tad
pricey
in
my
area
but
always
worth
the
price
of
admission
a
great
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
sweet
honey
and
coriander
taste
is
also
honey
and
coriander
the
coriander
is
quite
strong
in
this
but
in
a
good
way
it
helps
balance
the
honey
sweetness
the
beer
has
a
smooth
medium
body
mouthfeel
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
of
my
favorites
from
a
company
that
so
far
has
disappointed
me
great
job
o
not
a
fan
of
belgian
ales
but
even
so
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
be
careful
sucking
it
down
not
a
session
ale
this
trippel
pours
with
a
fine
foamy
white
head
and
deep
golden
color
fine
bubbles
in
the
carbonation
and
the
head
disappears
quickly
aroma
is
weak
there
is
a
little
wheat
or
floral
hintmaybe
slight
funky
yeast
aroma
but
faint
similar
in
flavor
of
a
weak
hefeweizen
but
with
a
little
corriander
thin
mouth
feel
the
over
7
alcohol
by
volume
is
hidden
well
smooth
drinker
but
nothing
exciting
or
outstandingi
would
have
to
be
told
this
was
a
belgianstyle
trippel
in
a
blind
tasting
o
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
very
easy
to
knock
back
unfortunately
there
were
few
markers
that
id
identify
as
memorable
not
an
unpleasant
experience
but
not
particularly
inspiring
i
might
order
this
if
i
wanted
something
clean
that
would
stay
out
of
the
way
of
what
im
eating
but
it
is
unlikely
to
become
a
goto
beer
for
me
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
2614
o
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
the
standard
flavors
youd
expect
in
a
trippel
the
coriander
and
other
yeast
spiciness
are
more
pronounced
than
a
typical
trippel
lends
a
certain
uniqueness
to
this
beer
the
beer
drinks
easily
and
comfortably
especially
the
nice
crisp
dry
finish
after
the
complexity
of
flavors
that
come
out
in
the
body
o
i
must
admit
this
is
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
it
has
its
place
but
unfortunately
not
with
me
i
like
beer
and
i
can
dig
this
but
i
wont
seek
this
brew
out
good
not
great
with
a
disclaimer
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
it
is
easy
on
the
carbonation
except
for
a
little
bite
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
it
is
pleasant
and
refreshing
notes
while
this
is
not
a
world
class
tripel
it
is
a
solid
one
for
me
it
surpasses
fat
tire
as
far
as
the
new
belgium
lineup
for
my
level
of
interest
i
would
love
to
get
a
hold
of
their
lips
of
faith
and
other
famous
craft
beers
somewhat
standard
belgian
yeast
spiciness
is
most
of
the
beer
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
coriander
is
pretty
subtle
to
me
compared
to
many
other
belgians
without
coriander
even
added
but
this
might
be
a
good
thing
a
nice
overall
interplay
between
spicy
yeast
and
citrusfruity
notes
surprisingly
pleasant
wish
it
was
bottle
conditioned
but
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
a
light
version
and
great
entrylevel
tripel
the
body
is
light
almost
medium
with
a
certain
depth
to
it
it
doesnt
have
the
range
of
the
master
belgians
but
its
only
just
short
its
lightly
crisp
very
well
carbonated
in
terms
of
adding
a
bite
and
a
flow
without
overdoing
it
and
an
almost
fluffy
smoothness
into
the
end
just
a
little
chalkiness
to
the
body
from
yeast
overall
for
2
99
for
22
ounces
this
is
a
good
bargain
although
i
cant
say
that
this
is
a
particularly
interesting
beer
as
ive
said
this
is
tame
and
the
flavors
arent
too
bold
but
this
is
a
session
trippel
if
there
ever
was
one
o
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
at
7
8
abv
you
can
get
into
trouble
if
youre
not
careful
always
find
myself
wanting
another
lol
o
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
its
a
bit
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
and
available
at
a
great
price
point
something
i
could
see
becoming
a
semiregular
second
bomber
to
buy
when
im
not
looking
for
a
sixpack
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
tripel
coming
from
an
american
brewery
i
really
like
it
2
99bomber
is
an
awesome
deal
for
this
brew
highly
recommended
im
impressed
o
looks
and
smells
better
than
it
tastes
would
definitely
benefit
from
less
spices
if
you
dont
mind
the
level
of
sweetness
could
be
pretty
sessionable
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
prefers
malts
to
hops
for
at
least
a
try
if
i
wasnt
feeling
too
picky
aka
going
to
a
grocery
store
for
beer
and
they
happened
to
have
this
i
would
consider
picking
it
up
decent
beer
nothing
special
golden
body
nice
and
hazy
thick
foam
which
rests
at
2
fingers
some
good
hanging
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
flowery
with
mixed
spices
and
sharp
coriander
flavor
has
the
spices
upfront
and
then
ends
in
a
nice
sweetness
warming
feel
nothing
complex
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
a
nice
tripel
overall
but
not
one
of
the
best
available
it
hits
on
most
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
youd
expect
from
the
style
but
doesnt
get
them
on
all
on
the
right
level
new
belgium
is
new
to
delaware
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
what
they
have
to
offer
an
enjoyable
beer
but
the
memories
will
quickly
fade
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
version
of
a
triple
but
not
great
if
offered
id
happily
drink
it
but
im
not
searching
it
out
there
are
way
too
many
other
better
triples
out
there
to
get
over
this
one
i
have
a
special
weakness
for
belgian
style
tripels
and
the
new
belgium
version
is
a
great
go
to
option
that
is
always
easily
available
it
pours
a
gorgeous
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
a
plenty
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
flowery
with
a
hint
of
the
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
fantastic
and
very
smooth
with
the
belgian
yeast
tones
and
a
sweetness
that
balance
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
sometimes
i
get
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
ending
but
not
this
time
it
was
smooth
and
well
balanced
throughout
a
bit
dry
with
a
sweet
finish
but
not
heavy
overall
an
excellent
trippel
and
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
this
beer
is
nuanced
complex
and
subtle
very
balanced
and
pleasant
and
provides
treats
for
all
the
senses
although
it
says
that
it
is
brewed
with
coriander
the
spice
is
hoplike
and
mingles
well
with
other
characteristics
very
versatile
will
wash
the
dust
down
on
hot
day
or
go
down
nicely
après
ski
i
would
say
best
paired
with
fatty
fish
like
salmon
a
pleasant
surprise
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
swallowing
leads
to
a
flash
of
ethanol
felt
on
the
back
of
the
throat
but
not
on
the
tongue
or
in
the
nostrils
closes
very
dry
nearly
astringent
with
light
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
and
tongue
overall
really
nice
american
brewed
belgium
tripel
has
great
flavor
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
to
sweet
strong
or
even
too
warm
from
the
alcohol
nice
beer
worth
a
drink
for
sure
id
drink
this
again
if
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
at
the
right
price
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
for
spice
lovers
this
one
might
tickle
your
fancy
overall
was
a
great
beer
and
would
try
it
again
if
i
could
get
this
in
alabama
o
ok
interpretation
of
the
style
flavors
are
not
outstandingly
represented
o
overall
not
a
bad
tripel
at
all
it
isnt
my
favorite
beer
style
in
the
world
but
i
can
enjoy
a
quality
beer
from
the
style
every
once
in
a
while
worth
a
try
remarks
id
definitely
buy
this
again
overall
a
pretty
good
tripel
one
of
the
first
american
craft
beers
id
tried
and
one
i
would
definitely
return
to
on
occasion
o
a
wellmade
belgian
tripel
which
is
likely
to
please
hop
lovers
as
well
a
good
buy
at
the
1
89
i
paid
at
honeygo
wine
spirits
in
perry
hall
maryland
in
june
love
new
belgium
beers
at
first
i
was
leery
to
try
this
because
coriander
usually
overpowers
the
ale
flavors
but
this
beer
nailed
it
smell
is
all
coriander
but
the
taste
is
complex
and
a
great
drink
ability
yet
another
great
beer
from
fort
collins
co
overall
a
very
good
tripel
o
no
flaws
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
very
drinkable
however
its
not
as
complex
or
interesting
as
some
tripels
overall
above
average
but
not
great
i
prefer
belgians
that
are
heavier
and
this
one
just
didnt
have
a
lot
of
distinguishing
features
dont
mind
enjoying
this
one
on
the
back
porch
though
o
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
one
no
real
flaws
and
a
solid
beer
for
the
price
point
but
not
what
a
tripel
can
be
overall
a
fine
trippel
glad
to
see
new
belgium
in
the
sunshine
state
o
pretty
damn
good
t
certainly
a
straightforward
and
excellent
example
of
the
style
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
who
cares
you
can
buy
this
everywhere
they
do
a
good
job
of
distributing
but
ive
never
seen
this
on
tap
which
would
be
worth
watching
for
new
belgium
makes
this
the
cleanest
most
approachable
beer
in
the
golden
belgian
style
atmosphere
is
really
strong
nice
effervescence
and
a
decent
head
with
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
back
end
nose
is
pungent
and
bready
with
hints
of
savory
spice
tastes
like
it
smells
light
pungent
and
bready
with
plenty
of
spice
and
a
slight
sweet
balance
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
this
is
one
tasty
beer
nice
range
of
flavors
that
favor
the
maltfruit
nature
of
tripels
while
making
sure
the
finish
isnt
cloying
its
not
terribly
complex
and
theres
just
a
tad
too
much
spiciness
in
the
finish
for
me
to
say
this
is
an
exceptional
example
of
the
style
but
its
quite
good
and
definitely
recommended
especially
as
a
gateway
to
belgium
tripels
o
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
alcohol
and
strong
flavor
a
staple
beer
in
my
fridge
due
to
its
excellent
taste
and
availability
here
in
texas
pours
out
a
nice
light
golden
color
its
mildly
hazy
and
is
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
it
has
some
nice
lacing
and
plenty
of
carbonation
the
aroma
has
a
mixture
of
fruits
clove
coriander
peppers
and
a
slight
peanut
smell
too
light
and
crispy
this
is
a
medium
bodied
ale
the
spices
are
nice
and
not
overpowering
the
coriander
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
the
malts
are
strong
at
first
but
as
it
travels
toward
the
back
of
your
throat
it
sweetens
up
just
a
little
it
is
dry
overall
not
a
bad
ale
and
it
goes
down
smoothly
too
overall
decent
but
the
particular
flavor
of
coriander
is
just
too
much
one
bottle
is
enough
o
another
excellently
crafted
balance
beer
from
new
belgium
its
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
tripel
style
but
still
packs
a
lot
of
fruit
spicy
flavor
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
that
doesnt
overwhelm
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
pours
to
a
medium
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
and
light
lacing
could
be
the
dusty
glass
sorry
aroma
is
spicy
coriander
intense
fruit
esters
from
the
yeast
and
sweet
caramel
flavor
is
meltinyourmouth
honey
and
biscuits
spices
fruits
and
a
balancing
spice
and
bitterness
to
offset
the
intense
sweetness
but
not
enough
to
dry
out
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
warming
and
appropriate
to
style
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
that
is
excellent
for
sipping
o
excellent
crisp
slightly
spicy
and
balanced
trippel
overall
a
moderately
good
triple
with
nice
flavors
and
an
easy
drinking
taste
and
feel
matched
with
the
moderate
price
for
a
triple
overall
it
is
quite
nice
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
well
carbonated
it
has
a
medium
dry
finish
alcohol
is
clearly
there
but
not
a
turn
off
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
probably
wont
buy
a
six
pack
this
was
included
in
a
folly
12
pack
o
a
quite
pleasant
beer
but
not
one
i
would
rush
to
drink
again
that
said
this
is
the
first
i
have
had
of
this
style
so
i
may
revisit
later
overall
very
pleasant
to
drink
possible
room
for
improvement
to
allow
hops
or
malts
to
come
forward
more
but
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
rjt
ive
always
liked
the
fat
tire
from
this
brewery
even
thought
it
tastes
like
dirt
i
have
also
tried
a
few
others
and
while
they
were
ok
i
dont
put
them
in
the
same
league
as
other
89
six
packs
that
are
available
store
had
this
trippel
on
sale
so
i
decided
to
try
it
as
i
really
enjoy
this
style
wow
was
not
expecting
this
but
to
me
it
tastes
like
schlitz
malt
liquor
or
some
of
the
other
cornsqueezins
with
high
abv
i
have
had
dozens
of
belgium
trips
and
this
is
not
a
good
rendition
whatsoever
if
this
were
a
blind
test
im
not
sure
i
could
differentiate
this
from
some
real
belgian
tripels
very
nice
brew
from
new
belgium
quite
the
unusual
tripel
the
head
is
gone
instantly
the
fruit
and
floral
is
quite
light
and
there
is
a
very
clear
alcoholic
presence
in
the
aftertaste
however
its
a
good
drink
the
taste
is
quite
good
i
may
or
may
not
get
this
again
while
i
am
a
fan
of
new
belgium
we
all
know
that
some
of
the
beers
can
be
considered
a
hit
or
miss
this
falls
in
the
latter
category
not
bad
but
not
great
in
any
case
ive
had
it
no
big
whoop
overall
a
nice
mild
american
brewed
belgium
ale
o
a
poor
mans
triple
but
one
that
scratches
the
itch
especially
given
the
price
points
of
the
best
of
the
belgians
o
a
pretty
plain
trippel
but
nothing
off
and
with
more
going
for
it
than
you
might
expect
from
a
3
99
dollar
bomber
drinks
well
alcohol
warms
the
stomach
a
bit
but
stays
out
of
the
way
otherwise
full
bodied
lightly
effervescent
smooth
with
a
nice
mellow
lingering
fade
to
the
aftertaste
a
solid
tripel
if
not
a
standout
o
i
know
i
am
all
over
the
board
here
but
it
is
certainly
enough
to
further
my
curiosity
into
this
style
i
dont
love
it
but
it
certainly
has
me
interested
to
step
outside
my
comfort
zone
of
classic
american
craft
styles
i
didnt
care
for
the
smell
but
the
look
taste
and
feel
were
all
very
enjoyable
i
tend
to
be
a
harsh
grader
compared
to
most
and
it
is
a
reasonably
priced
beer
at
8
abv
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
am
to
a
big
belgian
guy
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
high
alcohol
content
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chimay
goblet
virtually
no
head
hint
of
cloudiness
mediumamber
liquid
with
bubbles
fizzing
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
you
can
smell
the
yeast
on
this
thing
from
like
a
foot
away
and
the
closer
you
get
the
more
floral
it
gets
flavor
is
really
nice
sweet
a
little
spice
and
you
get
the
floral
and
yeast
from
the
nose
wellhidden
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
nice
too
with
good
carbonation
slick
and
a
light
shock
to
the
palette
from
the
alcohol
in
the
background
i
wont
lie
to
you
this
isnt
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
its
one
of
my
gotos
for
a
tripel
and
probably
an
easy
favorite
for
me
from
new
belgium
lets
recommend
a
nice
cd
by
the
japenese
renegade
toshimaru
nakamura
aton
with
andrea
neumann
12
once
bottle
with
a
recommended
date
of
october
6
2013
lighter
than
most
tripels
but
for
me
the
taste
really
suited
what
i
prefer
in
an
amber
ale
while
not
the
high
alcohol
content
of
your
normal
tripels
it
is
a
great
beer
that
can
be
sipped
and
savored
a
great
value
for
the
price
this
may
not
be
my
top
choice
in
this
category
of
beer
it
is
darn
close
as
it
is
not
as
filling
if
you
plan
on
drinking
a
few
i
did
not
grasp
anything
overpowering
in
a
particular
flavor
or
taste
just
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
with
a
little
more
bang
than
you
think
when
you
see
7
8
this
is
my
first
six
pack
and
i
am
sure
i
will
be
stocking
up
real
soon
i
can
give
a
more
detailed
review
then
as
i
am
battling
a
bad
cold
i
recommend
this
one
highly
new
belgium
tripple
is
a
good
solid
triple
that
is
lighter
for
the
style
making
it
quite
drinkable
however
it
falls
short
of
the
topshelf
triples
i
might
add
that
it
is
a
good
value
though
o
enjoyable
beer
great
representation
of
the
style
i
feel
like
its
missing
a
certain
texture
and
i
feel
like
the
sweetness
murders
this
beers
potential
for
being
an
allday
drinker
but
it
has
its
charm
a
great
offering
from
new
belgium
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
smallish
head
the
aroma
carries
a
nice
level
of
funk
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
and
is
quite
refreshing
feel
silky
medium
body
finish
is
average
and
slightly
wet
i
like
trying
all
types
of
beers
so
i
decided
to
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
new
beligum
trippel
it
was
without
a
doubt
the
most
distasteful
beer
i
have
ever
drank
i
would
rather
have
milwaukees
best
then
this
it
has
a
strong
taste
of
coriander
and
an
alcoholic
burn
in
your
stomach
from
the
high
alcohol
content
i
was
very
highly
dissapointed
in
this
beer
so
much
so
i
made
an
account
because
of
all
the
high
ratings
it
has
gotten
it
has
a
floral
taste
like
you
are
drinking
flowers
with
coriander
spice
in
it
all
in
all
i
would
never
recommend
this
to
anyone
i
dont
pour
it
into
glasses
as
i
feel
it
destroys
some
of
the
carbonation
so
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
regardless
i
had
to
go
get
another
six
pack
after
the
first
bottle
i
do
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
nor
can
i
imagine
why
it
is
even
produced
and
sold
at
local
shops
but
if
you
like
your
stomach
burning
and
drinking
flowers
go
for
it
this
is
a
flavorful
ale
with
well
hidden
alcohol
if
youre
trying
to
get
smashed
while
drinking
good
swill
this
would
be
a
great
choice
overall
for
what
it
is
its
quite
good
a
easy
find
low
price
delicious
and
drinkable
beer
also
a
refreshing
american
style
tripel
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
fairly
short
sitting
which
is
great
for
a
beer
around
8
definitely
a
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
before
sneaky
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
had
it
a
football
party
with
some
friends
we
are
home
brewers
and
very
critical
amazing
smell
earthy
gardenlike
like
i
just
watered
my
lawn
in
the
july
morning
looks
like
a
typical
straw
colored
lager
but
with
a
bit
more
pool
of
foam
atop
the
glass
with
legs
of
lace
taste
is
slow
to
hit
until
it
hits
the
middle
of
tongue
and
im
hit
with
banana
and
a
rinse
of
rye
bread
the
taste
lingers
forever
and
then
transforms
to
light
bitter
apple
i
do
not
notice
the
peppery
flavor
others
notice
at
all
but
i
dont
mind
sipped
like
a
fine
bourbon
is
the
best
way
to
experience
it
not
a
session
beer
it
is
so
sneaky
one
of
the
best
beers
i
can
find
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
o
overall
surprise
i
bought
this
as
a
palate
washer
and
it
was
pretty
good
for
a
buck
fifty
a
bottle
good
for
a
trippel
and
very
sessionable
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
yeast
with
a
full
pour
a
finger
of
head
that
reduces
down
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
some
lacing
smell
is
spices
more
spices
and
corriander
taste
is
sweet
some
fruit
but
again
heavy
spice
that
are
light
to
begin
with
and
settle
towards
the
finish
with
a
twang
on
the
tougue
the
taste
is
oddly
an
entirely
different
beast
the
yeast
is
the
first
thing
to
hit
you
and
the
yeast
alone
the
biscuity
character
of
fat
tire
is
definitely
present
as
well
and
seems
to
come
in
a
slightly
different
incarnation
with
each
sip
the
dominating
fruit
of
the
aroma
is
only
faintly
present
in
the
taste
which
while
not
necessarily
bad
is
a
surprise
also
the
7
8
abv
is
virtually
impossible
to
detect
as
this
is
very
light
drinking
carbonation
is
medium
to
high
and
only
serves
to
up
the
refreshing
level
thats
already
quite
high
the
finish
is
a
mix
of
a
faint
bananapeach
hybrid
and
a
buttery
yeast
note
that
clings
to
the
palate
for
a
bit
overall
pretty
nice
though
still
just
good
overall
i
enjoyed
its
pepperiness
it
does
linger
for
a
long
time
i
was
hoping
for
an
aftertaste
that
didnt
well
last
for
beyond
two
minutes
but
the
real
beauty
of
this
trippel
is
in
food
pairing
i
first
tried
it
with
indian
dishes
chicken
tikka
masala
curry
tomato
cream
sauce
bengan
bharta
curry
eggplant
and
palak
paneer
spinach
and
cheese
cube
curry
and
this
beers
flavors
absolutely
locked
in
and
came
alive
as
well
as
in
perfect
balance
with
the
indian
curry
flavors
it
is
truly
amazing
most
likely
because
of
the
coriander
it
is
one
of
the
main
spices
in
almost
all
indian
food
try
it
sometime
it
is
a
treat
for
the
senses
o
much
much
too
peppery
its
militant
spiciness
makes
it
untenable
as
a
session
beer
my
initial
pour
got
me
about
a
finger
of
solid
bonewhite
head
that
slowly
fell
leaving
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
deep
gold
with
nequality
clarity
and
both
midas
and
croesus
could
be
seen
licking
their
lips
nose
was
at
once
sweet
spicy
and
musty
if
you
have
the
capacity
to
reconcile
such
a
concept
there
was
a
honeylike
malty
sweetness
along
with
some
sort
of
spice
all
overlain
by
the
mustiness
of
the
yeast
whew
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
riot
of
flavors
on
the
tongue
it
started
out
with
a
flowery
perfuminess
giving
way
to
a
slight
spice
followed
by
a
yeasty
dryness
that
was
not
really
expected
finish
was
quite
dry
not
to
the
point
of
gasping
for
air
but
close
the
pricetag
4
49
is
insane
for
how
good
this
is
phew
there
is
a
stamp
reading
29jul12
but
i
did
not
see
any
lees
if
it
were
truly
bottleconditioned
man
this
not
only
held
up
really
well
but
could
have
even
sat
a
bit
longer
worth
a
try
ogood
flavors
but
the
balance
isnt
there
if
they
could
reign
stuff
in
the
beer
could
improve
greatly
now
i
love
belgianstyle
ales
so
for
me
to
be
so
thoroughly
underwhelmed
by
this
offering
speaks
volumes
i
almost
wonder
if
this
bottle
has
exceeded
its
shelf
life
the
date
on
the
bottle
is
3
months
ago
to
the
day
but
i
dont
know
if
thats
the
bottling
date
or
the
bestby
date
based
on
my
experience
though
one
could
readily
skip
this
tripel
and
miss
absolutely
nothing
in
the
process
o
yum
ofor
the
price
this
is
a
fine
drinking
tripel
and
i
would
consider
drinking
more
because
i
can
get
a
six
pack
for
the
same
price
as
one
750
of
karmeliet
however
the
coriander
and
spice
flavors
are
a
bit
heavy
handed
and
the
resulting
beer
is
slightly
herbal
and
overly
husky
when
compared
against
the
better
examples
of
the
style
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
true
to
the
style
with
some
flair
i
have
not
found
a
beer
i
didnt
like
from
new
belgium
what
a
great
value
it
pours
a
nice
clear
glass
with
a
beautiful
head
its
clean
smell
and
crisp
taste
make
for
a
super
value
i
call
it
a
go
to
beer
i
purposely
waited
on
drinking
a
couple
of
these
before
offering
a
review
there
are
plenty
of
belgian
not
belgian
style
beers
at
or
below
the
level
of
of
this
fine
trippel
as
far
as
i
know
and
i
may
be
wrong
there
are
no
existing
belgian
triples
at
this
beers
valuepriceflavor
enjoy
it
new
belgium
is
giving
us
a
good
deal
and
a
fine
beverage
using
i
think
the
finest
ingredients
possible
for
a
modestly
priced
beer
o
not
a
perfect
beer
but
a
great
example
of
the
style
from
an
american
brewer
id
be
very
happy
with
a
mixasix
consisting
of
three
of
these
and
three
abbeys
so
for
what
its
worth
i
guess
you
could
now
call
me
a
new
belgium
fan
even
though
im
still
no
fan
of
fat
tire
or
ranger
overall
the
combo
of
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
just
doesnt
work
for
me
the
correander
was
to
over
powering
tastefeel
fantastic
im
really
shocked
this
beer
isnt
rated
even
higher
than
it
is
you
get
a
good
dose
of
banana
and
clove
and
all
of
that
and
its
quite
sweet
but
it
remains
balanced
through
all
of
that
i
get
the
occasional
taste
of
alcohol
in
there
as
well
just
holy
hell
this
is
a
good
beer
especially
for
the
price
the
feel
just
tops
this
whole
beer
off
perfect
carbonation
and
it
drinks
very
smoothly
i
want
another
really
liked
this
beer
from
start
to
finish
could
feel
the
alcohol
but
it
all
still
worked
together
o
not
sure
about
this
trippel
for
some
reason
it
comes
off
strong
and
pungent
in
the
wrong
ways
and
not
really
pleasant
with
a
strong
medicinal
alcohol
flavor
that
last
throughout
and
lingers
this
one
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
for
some
reason
sorry
nb
better
luck
next
time
cheers
this
pours
a
golden
tan
with
billowy
foam
that
quickly
dies
down
its
lightly
spiced
with
coriander
notes
and
has
a
lightly
floral
flavor
with
hint
of
spice
nicely
bodied
its
an
alltogether
decent
triple
but
not
one
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
new
belgium
may
not
be
my
favorite
brewery
but
their
beers
tend
to
be
well
done
balanced
and
delicious
a
good
example
of
the
belgian
style
overall
impression
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
great
flavormy
first
thought
was
it
keeps
finishing
as
i
expected
the
fruit
notes
to
be
the
end
the
hop
at
the
end
was
surprising
but
nice
the
fruit
notes
themselves
are
very
interesting
the
banana
works
really
well
with
the
sweetness
and
the
spice
provides
a
good
balance
to
the
whole
thing
so
it
doesnt
become
cloying
or
overly
sweet
if
i
had
to
pick
a
favorite
part
i
think
it
would
be
that
transition
from
fruit
to
hop
gosh
thats
nice
an
okay
american
interpretation
of
a
tripel
not
very
complex
o
overall
this
is
a
quality
brew
another
great
blend
from
new
belgium
really
enjoyed
the
smell
really
came
off
as
bananas
to
me
i
really
like
bananas
and
banana
bread
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
fall
season
its
light
and
crisp
with
warmth
at
the
end
great
for
the
colder
season

less
coriander
on
the

and
palate
than
expected
colloidal
cloudiness
on
the
last
pour
that
stays
suspended
in
the
beer
still
tastes
great
moderate
carbonation
very
tasty
ale
the
abv
is
not
evident
it
is
light
and
bright
not
warm
and
vinous
perfectly
balanced
would
definitely
repurchase
o
well
done
a
solid
performance
from
new
belgium
i
tend
to
favor
beers
with
a
lower
abv
but
between
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
i
didnt
spend
much
time
fretting
about
the
7
8
the
significant
coriander
flavor
and
aftertaste
might
be
a
deterrent
for
some
affecting
drinkability
but
i
found
it
a
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
beer
pours
golden
in
color
carbonation
is
perfect
smell
is
slightly
weak
and
one
dimensional
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
strong
coriander
flavor
that
hangs
around
drinkable
but
dont
think
i
would
purchase
again
the
taste
is
not
something
i
like
its
not
bad
just
not
for
me
the
after
taste
also
hangs
around
a
strong
taste
of
sweetbitter
yeast
along
with
hints
of
herbs
not
the
most
refreshingdrinkable
beer
but
eat
sip
is
a
treat
thats
the
way
to
drink
it
an
exceptional
feel
when
it
goes
down
gives
this
brew
a
clear
difference
against
traditional
brews
overall
a
good
beer
with
more
pros
then
cons
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
showings
from
a
brewery
that
i
have
a
few
chips
on
my
shoulder
against
it
is
far
from
an
elite
tripel
although
for
a
sub
10
sixer
this
is
far
from
bad
for
lovers
of
the
floral
notes
this
is
one
to
look
for
this
is
the
last
of
the
new
belgium
sampler
my
buddy
sent
me
and
one
of
the
better
ones
of
the
last
few
i
tried
4
0
d
quite
tasty
corriander
should
be
in
more
tripels
nice
belgian
lace
on
the
glass
beautiful
golden
color
fruit
and
a
slight
pepper
character
to
the
nose
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
pleasant
effervescence
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
for
a
fairly
high
abv
the
alcohol
is
balanced
with
a
malty
sweetness
and
fruity
esters
not
hard
to
see
why
the
bjcp
lists
this
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
it
had
most
of
the
things
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
an
extra
amount
of
bubble
gum
that
i
dont
normally
find
in
this
style
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
went
down
very
smooth
with
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
one
bomber
is
just
enough
for
me
this
may
be
the
most
drinkable
tripel
i
have
had
to
date
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
and
the
appearance
the
mouthfeel
was
also
noteworthy
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
lack
of
balance
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
i
wish
the
malts
stuck
out
a
little
more
to
balance
out
all
that
belgian
yeast
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
again
when
looking
for
a
decent
tripel
that
wont
break
the
bank
theres
not
many
affordable
tripels
but
this
is
one
of
them
i
can
see
myself
keeping
a
bottle
or
two
in
the
fridge
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
all
in
all
this
was
a
nice
tripel
but
it
doesnt
come
close
to
being
one
of
my
favorites
but
for
what
it
is
and
how
much
it
costs
its
a
bargain
and
a
good
no
thrills
tripel
new
belgium
did
a
good
job
with
this
beer
and
i
feel
like
this
is
the
definition
of
a
solid
tripel
good
job
guys
definitely
worth
a
try
a
good
trippel
in
a
12
oz
bottle
i
will
probably
have
this
again
o
meh
below
average
offering
for
this
style
i
will
not
try
this
again
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
and
again
not
something
i
would
want
while
mowing
the
yard
but
would
probally
go
well
wtih
a
fat
pork
chop
off
the
grill
overall
new
belgium
brewing
just
started
distributing
in
michigan
so
i
have
had
three
of
them
in
the
past
week
their
fat
tire
was
mediocre
and
their
redtoberfest
was
alright
so
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
out
of
this
one
i
was
delightfully
surprised
this
is
a
really
good
tripel
and
the
coriander
helps
out
a
lot
i
highly
recommend
this
one
o
a
great
easily
accessible
triple
overall
although
my
rating
of
this
beer
doesnt
particularly
reflect
what
im
about
to
say
i
do
have
to
say
it
was
a
good
beer
for
the
price
and
taste
just
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
something
to
just
drink
and
enjoy
for
a
good
price
o
personally
i
dont
know
if
i
like
the
spiciness
of
this
beer
or
the
sticky
feeling
it
leaves
in
your
mouth
following
drinking
it
but
i
can
see
others
liking
it
it
definitely
has
a
complex
mouthfeel
to
it
though
interesting
to
note
is
that
it
leaves
no
lacing
whatsoever
at
any
rate
its
a
fairly
decent
representation
of
the
style
just
a
little
twodimensional
in
flavor
though
lots
of
yeast
and
fruit
come
through
on
the
nose
and
in
taste
but
not
much
else
appearance
and
mouthfeel

to

flavors
are
everything
you
want
in
a
tripel
with
a
very
small
hint
of
coriander
mind
you
this
is
not
my
style
im
not
a
belgian
fan
but
i
had
the
bartender
the
owners
father
in
law
at
orcutt
brew
pour
me
a
small
taste
first
it
was
inoffensive
so
i
had
him
pour
me
a

nearly

on

that
common

that
pierces
the

the

mouthfeel

a

then
tart
white
grape
there
is
a
bit
of
that
familiar
belgian
yeast
finish
the
thing
i
find
clever
about
this
beer
is
that
everything
is
mild
which
has
caused
this
nonbelgian
drinker
to
sit
and
enjoy
a
pint
good
job
new
belgium
this
was
nice
american
take
on
the
style
with
a
smooth
drinkability
and
well
balanced
flavors
that
didnt
run
over
each
other
despite
the
coriander
addition
im
always
up
for
a
good
tripel
and
this
one
really
surprised
me
new

fairly
clear

with
a
bit
more
than
to
fingers
of
fluffy
white
foam
capping
the
beer
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
solid
the
nose
has
a
good
bit
of
pear
to
it
before
light
pepper
and
clove
waft
through
the
coriander
adds
a
nice
subtle
citrus
note
to
the
aroma
the
flavor
has
some
palestone
fruit
sweetness
leading
off
before
the
phenols
come
in
on
the
back
end
the
pepper
and
clove
arent
too
intense
with
the
coriander
doing
a
nice
job
of
helping
temper
them
i
wish
the
esters
were
just
a
little
bit
more
prominent
though
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
active
but
the
body
is
just
a
touch
too
chewy
for
me
new
belgiums
trippel
is
a
good
take
on
the
style
i
was
wary
of
it
being
spiced
but
the
brewers
displayed
a
deft
hand
with
the
coriander
this
is
one
my
first
craft
beers
probably
the
first
belgian
i
ever
had
for
me
this
was
one
of
those
beers
that
really
expanded
my
mind
and
showed
me
how
creative
and
flavorful
beer
could
be
it
pours
very
light
amber
and
crystal
clear
immediately
you
smell
those
nice
esters
from
the
belgian
yeast
slightly
tart
and
slightly
fruity
its
a
big
spicy
malt
body
with
a
very
subtle
coriander
presence
the
hops
come
in
at
the
end
and
sort
of
muddle
with
everything
at
7
8
the
alcohol
is
incredibly
well
hidden
o
new
belgium
trippel
is
an
exceptionally
delicious
and
wellmade
triple
at
a
tasty
price
the
alcohol
is
kept
to
a
lower
level
for
the
style
without
sacrificing
flavor
or
nuances
that
are
common
to
the
style
new
belgium
has
one
of
the
finer
americanmade
tripels
on
their
hands
here
pours
a
clear
solar
amber
with
a
thick
and
fluffy
if
not
persistent
ivory
head
malty
aroma
has
a
decided
coriander
overtone
and
hints
of
yeast
and
apple
refreshing
flavor
has
firm
fruity
and
malty
tones
plus
a
noticeable
though
not
overpowering
note
of
coriander
as
well
as
a
hint
of
yeast
firm
smooth
texture
has
good
body
and
decent
fizz
o
one
of
the
best
examples
of
domestic
tripel
they
have
been
making
this
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
their
yeasts
show
tons
of
depth
and
this
masks
the
alcohol
perfectly
a
good
drink
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
mouthfeel
this
tends
to
be
a
bit
the
thin
bodied
side
for
a
trippel
but
not
by
much
it
is
rather
close
to
what
i
expected
i
discovered
this
beer
recently
and
because
of
the
reviews
i
read
on
this
site
i
thought
i
would
try
it
man
am
i
glad
i
did
this
is
now
my
favorite
beer
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
the
coriander
is
what
makes
the
difference
i
have
never
tasted
a
beer
that
was
so
delicious
not
a
trappist
but
a
great
choice
to
get
a
sixer
the
beer
is
hazy
and
golden
yellow
hued
an
inch
and
a
half
of
head
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
behind
the
aroma
offers
coriander
yeast
sweet
fruity
malts
alcohol
some
nice
citrus
flavors
meld
well
with
spices
medium
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
decent
but
not
to
the
level
of
the
classic
authentic
belgian
notables
in
the
style
im
not
impressed
with
new
belgium
as
a
whole
and
this
beer
did
nothing
to
dispel
my
feelings
its
mostly
drinkable
as
anything
bad
points
are
not
significant
just
merely
an
average
beer
of
its
type
if
that
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
mild
tasting
tripel
with
a
good
balance
of
flavors
o
this
was
a
very
refreshing
and
wellcrafted
belgian
ale
this
reminded
me
more
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
like
duvel
with
some
nice
lemon
and
citrusy
notes
o
a
good
domestic
tripel
at
a
reasonable
price
o
pretty
standard
for
an
american
representation
for
the
style
o
not
bad
but
not
one
id
revisit
complex
but
simple
has
characteristics
of
both
the
hoppy
and
fruity
worlds
reminds
me
of
their
other
belgian
style
ale
abbey
ontap
at
the
brewery
tasting
room
new
belgium
does
a
nice
job
with
this
american
brewed
tripel
it
pretty
much
hits
right
down
the
style
guidelines
the
lean
malt
body
gives
a
touch
of
dough
and
cracker
while
the
hops
are
mild
with
a
spicy
earthiness
the
yeast
really
shines
with
subtle
notes
of
pear
black
pepper
clove
and
flowers
dry
enough
too
which
many
american
versions
are
not
overall
definitely
a
different
tasting
tripel
its
got
shades
of
a
kolsch
or
saison
im
not
big
on
herbalgrassy
notes
in
my
beer
so
this
beer
might
appeal
more
to
others
still
very
drinkable
and
worth
trying
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
inspired
ale
a
little
too
sweet
and
malty
to
be
a
true
tripel
could
of
used
a
little
more
yeasty
funk
but
what
is
here
tastes
good
it
is
very
drinkable
if
you
like
belgium
beer
you
will
like
this
one
not
bad
not
great
the
medicinal
plastic
aroma
take
away
from
the
good
points
would
recommend
especially
for
the
price
i
paid
10
for
a
6er
overall
a
commendable
effort
by
new
belgium
but
belgian
ales
just
arent
my
thing
too
syrupy
sweet
and
malty
for
my
taste
doa
tasted
okay
has
a
decent
feel
its
a
nice
style
of
beer
with
a
high
alcohol
content
belgians
are
always
complex
and
hard
to
describe
i
feel
like
i
am
going
to
have
to
review
beer
again
this
again
but
i
like
it
compared
to
other
belgian
trippels
ive
had
and
its
much
cheaper
bon
appetit
poured
from
bottle
to
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
grainy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
12
finger
white
head
some
retention
and
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
with
a
sweet
malt
character
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
and
a
light
clover
banana
not
as
detectable
as
i
would
have
liked
the
flavor
starts
with
an
earthy
hop
character
upfront
together
with
a
mild
bitterness
the
higher
abv
and
heat
is
prevelant
pretty
quickly
but
isnt
much
of
a
distraction
as
it
mellows
in
the
middle
as
the
sweet
malt
balances
everything
out
finishes
with
a
gentle
sweetness
and
mild
bitterness
on
the
tongue
some
carbonation
and
lighter
bodied
considering
the
big
nature
of
the
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
exceptional
i
will
likely
not
be
back
any
time
soon
o
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
smooth
overall
a
decent
beer
but
either
the
style
or
the
beer
just
isnt
up
my
alley
for
another
go
any
time
soon
o
definitely
better
than
average
but
not
something
that
i
will
search
out
if
i
want
a
triple
given
the
other
amazing
belgium
triples
poured
this
tripel
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
poured
a
golden
color
clear
produced
nice
white
frothy
head
lacing
was
off
the
charts
the
aroma
consisted
of
fruity
peach
and
a
slight
hint
of
spicy
coriander
medium
in
body
this
ale
was
smooth
and
crisp
light
malted
grain
taste
of
floral
herbs
fruity
peach
and
some
hop
bitterness
not
sure
if
this
a
beginners
tripel
but
this
is
an
excellent
tasting
brew
prost
hazy
banana
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
sweet
aroma
a
mix
of
fruity
esters
spice
from
the
yeast
and
sugary
bread
from
the
malt
no
real
hops
to
speak
of
sweet
malty
flavor
smooths
over
the
warming
alcohol
notes
there
are
some
nice
esters
here
banana
maybe
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
bitterness
and
the
body
a
good
tripel
o
its
not
the
best
tripel
ive
had
but
it
is
certainly
good
that
i
can
pick
this
up
at
a
grocery
store
it
lacks
a
lot
of
character
and
is
outdone
by
many
other
tripels
if
i
were
at
the
grocery
store
id
grab
a
sixer
if
i
was
at
a
bottle
shop
i
would
breeze
right
past
it
was
surpised
to
find
out
abv
was
as
high

o
a
nice
offering
from
new
belgium
giving
an
introduction
to
belgian
tripels
again
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
very
nice
but
compared
to
belgian
tripels
cant
quite
stand
up
to
them
however
for
the
price
here
in
the
us
one
that
i
will
likely
be
coming
back
to
again
d
a
solid
american
interruption
of
the
tripel
style
far
from
top
tier
but
a
very
solid
value
given
the
low
price
tag
worth
checking
out
but
not
something
i
would
necessarily
recommend
oaverage
not
bellow
and
certainly
not
above
its
worth
a
try
but
it
isnt
unique
or
anything
great
notes
i
havent
been
a
huge
fan
of
new
belgiums
offerings
in
the
past
although
i
do
greatly
appreciate
their
companys
ethos
and
wish
to
support
them
buying
this
great
beer
will
have
to
be
how
i
show
my
support
of
their
mission
this
beer
captures
the
essence
of
this
style
a
lovely
if
unusual
interpretation
of
a
golden
tripel
hazy
pour
with
a
lasting
sticky
head
the
nose
is
where
this
beer
shines
nbs
unconventional
belgian
yeast
strain
yields
two
distinct
notes
sulfur
and
banana
neither
of
which
are
mainstays
in
this
style
totally
wild
experience
amplified
by
the
juxtaposition
of
those
bold
flavors
in
an
otherwise
simple
balanced
brew
the
remainder
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
but
thats
ok
this
is
one
i
dont
mind
sipping
swirling
and
then
going
for
the
payoff
is
a
big
deep
whiff
taste
is
quite
clean
and
citrusy
with
pear
being
quite
prominent
and
the
bananalemon
taking
a
backseat
the
overall
cleanliness
is
what
really
makes
this
beer
for
me
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
tripels
but
this
one
is
so
dry
and
crisp
with
the
alcohol
barely
detectable
a
beer
i
will
definitely
go
back
to
again
o
the
coriander
is
a
bit
strong
but
besides
that
a
solid
brew
an
interesting
brew
pours
a
honey
color
with
no
haze
at
all
crystal
clear
good
white
head
but
it
fades
away
instantly
smell
is
yeast
and
a
bit
of
herbs
and
spices
corriander
the
bottle
says
but
it
must
be
corriander
seed
not
fresh
herb
itself
too
musky
for
that
flavor
is
nice
malty
and
sweet
like
a
wheatwine
in
ways
only
sweet
at
the
very
end
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
could
stand
a
touch
more
carbonation
to
brighten
it
up
medium
body
despite
its
light
color
and
lighter
in
the
stomach
down
easy
sessionable
except
for
its
strength
a
good
beer
for
an
emerging
spring
strong
enough
to
keep
ya
warm
but
light
enough
to
want
to
drink
outside
nothing
necessarily
jawdropping
but
a
really
solid
beer
and
very
easy
drinking
golden
in
appearance
with
a
half
thumbs
width
white
head
that
quickly
escapes
taste
and
smell
follow
each
other
pretty
well
with
some
belgian
yeast
banana
coriander
and
grass
some
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
flavor
to
my
disappointment
a
prickly
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
an
okay
tripel
for
the
price
but
not
the
best
for
the
style
not
much
depth
to
this
o
a
solid
beer
easy
drinking
and
nothing
offensive

nice

well
balanced

nice
flavor
profile
and
complexity
overall
new
belgium
trippel
is
a
very
drinkable
yet
mild
and
plain
trippel
belgian
style
ale
o
a
decent
beer
from
new
belgium
there
are
some
belgiantype
characteristics
but
this
is
most
certainly
an
american
beer
with
a
nod
to
belgian
roots
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
tripels
but
still
a
decent
beer
thats
well
priced
and
easy
to
find
in
the
states
do
this
beer
represents
a
fair
approximation
of
traditional
belgian
qualities
packaged
into
a
relatively
palatefriendly
product
nose
outdistances
actual
taste
in
authenticity
and
interest
with
palatecleansing
acidity
being
overstated
it
could
be
a
better
tripel
by
getting
acidity
under
control
while
cultivating
more
phenolic
spice
and
some
fusel
qualities
in
the
flavor
its
taken
me
way
the
hell
too
long
to
try
this
little
guy
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
little
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
banana
clove
wheat
coriander
orange
peel
light
lemon
zest
and
a
touch
of
cardamom
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
vague
sense
of
sweetness
throughout
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
surprisingly
very
nice
little
tripel
maybe
not
one
of
the
paragons
of
the
style
but
an
enjoyable
example
nonetheless
nice
overall
looks
are
deceiving
and
all
aspects
are
better
than
you
would
expect
overall
as
stated
earlier
this
tastes
more
like
a
saison
than
a
trippel
but
it
still
tastes
incredibly
good
it
tastes
great
and
its
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
to
anyone
whose
a
craft
beer
lover
i
do
not
hold
it
against
new
belgium
that
their
belgian
style
trippel
sic
is
nothing
like
an
actual
tripel
its
more
like
a
belgianstyle
golden
ale
and
a
damn
fine
one
at
that
its
hard
to
believe
that
an
american
brewer
is
making
a
really
welldone
belgianstyle
golden
ale
bottleconditioned
mind
you
that
sells
for
around
1
50
bottle
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
product
in
the
new
belgium
line
ive
had
it
a
few
times
now
and
the
one
time
i
had
it
on
tap
it
was
much
crisper
with
heavier
carbonation
that
almost
got
in
the
way
of
some
of
the
more
subtle
tastes
still
it
comes
highly
recommended
d
overall
one
of
the
better
tripels
coming
out
of
the
states
i
have
had
in
awhile
most
are
too
sweet
and
heavy
on
the
candi
sugar
but
this
one
has
a
good
yeast
backbone
and
dryness
d
a
good
american
craft
beer
dressed
up
as
a
trappist
for
halloween
lighter
than
a
real
tripel
a
solid
craft
beer
that
goes
down
very
easily
d
this
was
a
decent
tripel
but
nothing
special
the
scent
and
taste
were
nice
but
not
the
best
the
body
was
good
but
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
so
it
wasnt
the
easiest
to
drink
fairly
enjoyable
but
not
good
enough
to
recommend

great
version
of
a
belgian
tripel
with
the
nice
twist
of
the
coriander
at
a
very
good
price
personally
this
doesnt
stand
out
as
a
triple
id
prefer
the
allagash
or
possibly
longtrail
the
fat
tire
is
a
much
better
choice
from
this
brewer
mo
it
is
okay
i
guess
i
am
not
as
big
a
fan
as
mos
of
new
belgium
so
many
better
trippels
around
overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
will
by
steadily
now
i
had
this
during
winter
but
in
the
summer
i
think
it
could
even
be
better
try
this
one
o
a
very
good
amercian
version
of
a
belgium
tripple
very
good
price
at
8
a
sixer
new
belgium
trippel
despite
the
popularity
of
fat
tire
it
is
the
belgian
style
beers
that
new
belgium
brews
that
are
the
hallmark
of
the
brewery
the
new
belgium
trippel
has
a
clear
golden
body
and
ample
frothy
head
the
aroma
is
mild
but
hits
all
the
notes
expected
of
a
good
tripel
the
flavor
is
similar
you
get
the
classic
belgian
flavors
chewy
bread
and
yeast
covered
with
the
gumball
sweetness
but
they
are
subtle
the
warming
alcohol
is
present
throughout
especially
at
the
finish
the
new
belgium
trippel
is
a
great
sipping
experience
but
beware
a
few
will
have
me
feeling
it
the
next
day
im
impressed
with
how
light
it
is
and
how
well
it
hides
the
alcohol
and
am
enjoying
drinking
it
but
i
find
it
really
unbalanced
alas
o
id
buy
this
again
its
a
great
tasting
beer
i
love
belgium
ale
so
this
was
a
good
purchase
o
pretty
good
triple
from

good
belgium
transition
beer
and
easy
drinker
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
12

that
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of

drip
back
down
into
the
remaining

on
the

down
smell
is
of
malt
fruits
spices
yeast
and
some
bubble
gum
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
bubble
gum
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
trippel
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
i
just
tried
this
beer
recently
i
am
a
fairly
newyoung
beer
drinker
so
there
are
still
many
beers
to
sample
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
tasting
beers
i
have
tired
smooth
and
crisp
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
to
have
yearround
belgian

fan
get
a
pack
youll
want
a
case
after
trying
one
and
enjoy
the
new
belgium
tripple
has
the
characteristics
of
a
real
belgian
trippel
but
falls
a
little
short
its
kind
of
like
all
the
components
are
there
but
its
a
beer
that
makes
me
say
mmmm
thats
good

the
taste
comes
across
with
yellow
fruits
accented
by
an
earthy
sort
of
spice
it
is
clean
and
filling
unionmade
overall
somewhat
enjoyable
but
not
gravitating
towards
that
strongly
but
i
could
see
myself
having
this
again
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
soft
on
the
palate
with
a
wet
finish
there
is
a
floral
flavor
and
feeling
to
this
whole
beer
that
makes
it
quite
enjoyable
the
corriander
is
present
but
not
annoying
it
is
a
fine
beer
overall
i
would
have
it
again
a
little
too
sweet
for
a
tripel
o
i
would
like
a
more
complex
beer
but
at
the
price
of
8
99
for
a
sixer
its
good
i
like
coriander
and
this
beer
definitely
has
it
also
good
with
a
hearty
meal
a
decent
tripel
for
the
money
a
very
good
tripel
golden
in
color
with
a
touch
of
amber
long
lasting
white
head
the
aroma
consists
of
feint
peach
grain
and
some
berries
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
grain
spice
and
hops
balance
the
malt
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
midway
and
carries
through
into
the
finish
this
seems
actually
pretty
clean
for
a
trippel
and
goes
down
fairly
well
even
better
with
food
id
imagine
as
this
beer
by
itself
doesnt
seem
to
distinguish
itself
from
other
trippels
curious
as
to
how
this
would
age
a
solid
beer
that
is
more
herbal
than
most
tripels
and
less
sweet
but
still
falls
well
within
the
category
pours
a
brilliant
golden
with
a
short
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
smells
yeasty
like
a
fresh
dinner
roll
and
there
are
huge
notes
of
coriander
as
well
as
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
the
taste
is
biscuity
herbal
and
slightly
sweet
but
most
definitely
on
the
dryer
side
for
the
style
a
little
bit
grainy
in
the
mouth
almost
chalky
but
overall
this
is
a
fairly
pleasant
beer
this
beer
is
very
taste
of
an
authentic
but
much
fresher
belgian
ale
i
enjoyed
the
great
malyiness
of
this
beer
as
well
as
the
great
biscuit
malt
and
carbonation
that
they
always
do
well
the
mouth
feel
was
extremely
dry
not
my
fav
but
very
true
to
style
overall
a
very
outstanding
beer
o
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
a
little
light
in
the
flavor
department
d
as
a
tripel
it
seems
like
a
one
trick
pony
that
is
one
flavor
and
everything
else
is
just
a
guess
but
for
8
99
for
a
sixer
it
is
an
incredible
bargain
if
you
have
a
taste
for
belgium
solid
beer
for
sure
but
i
feel
the
same
way
about
this
as
i
do
about
their
dubbel
its
a
good
take
on
the
style
but
the
edge
goes
to
the
trappist
versions
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
wheat
notes
with
some
pepper
and
belgian
yeast
notes
there
is
not
much
sweetness
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
also
full
of
yeast
and
wheat
notes
with
some
white
pepper
and
a
little
bit
of
candy
sugar
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
this
is
okay
the
coriander
and
soapy
hops
are
a
little
much
though
overall
i
understand
why
this
isnt
presently
among
the
top
20
or
even
top
50
of
the
tripels
on
ba
its
good
drinking
make
no
mistake
regarding
comparable
tripels
its
probably
closest
to
tripel
karmeliet
with
its
flavor
profile
but
tk
packs
a
bit
more
of
a
punch
than
this
nbs
trippel
o
very
easy
drinker
alcohol
is
very
hidden
nice
spicy
finish
would
like
a
little
more
esters
to
go
with
the
phenols
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
o
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
a
deviation
from
the
styles
im
normally
used
to
will
hit
others
in
this
style
definitely
overall
a
very
good
brew
fairly
interesting
in
the
taste
and
it
seems
to
hit
very
near
home
on
the
accuracy
of
the
style
d
excellent
sipping
beer
but
tastes
so
good
youll
be
sipping
often
delicious
and
refreshing
this
beer
pours
rather
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
mediumhigh
spicy
citrus
esters
as
well
as
some
bubble
gum
the
flavor
is
quite
delicious
a
nice
balancing
act
of
slightly
sweet
malt
and
spicy
peppery
character
from
the
yeast
the
beer
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
a
mediumlow
hop
bitterness
and
spicy
hop
flavor
leaving
you
wanting
more
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
carbonation
nearing
high
but
appropriately
so
overall
a
satisfying
well
executed
trippel
overall
this
is
a
nice
tripel
not
too
different
than
la
fin
du
monde
maybe
not
quite
as
good
not
a
bad
tripel
at
all
and
quite
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
content
as
with
the
brewerys
example
of
the
dubbel
style
bottle
conditioning
would
probably
do
this
beer
justice
but
its
perfectly
good
without
it
this
would
pair
excellently
with
spicier
dishes
or
even
lighter
fare
like
salads
im
not
sure
id
call
this
beer
a
triple
yes
the
alcohol
is
up
there
but
the
flavor
isnt
nearly
as
bold
as
other
triples
hell
the
leffe
blonde
seemed
to
have
as
much
if
not
more
flavor
it
does
hit
a
price
point
at
around
7
50
a
six
here
but
i
probably
wont
be
revising
this
one
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
ive
got
to
say
american
made
belgian
beers
arent
the
greatest
at
all
its
not
the
easiest
style
to
copy
for
only
7
8
i
can
taste
all
of
it
nb
did
a
terrible
job
at
hiding
it
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
o
not
a
great
tripel
but
a
good
enough
beer
yeastyplain
and
citrustart
not
recommended
but
i
might
someday
have
another
overallnotes
i
remember
being
kind
of
mum
on
this
a
long
time
ago
and
i
can
see
why
its
a
good
beer
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
dozens
of
other
higherquality
tripels
out
there
certainly
worth
a
taste
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
hunt
for
one
o
way
back
in
the
day
this
was
a
staple
of
mine
honestly
havent
had
it
in
years
still
enjoy
it
and
think
its
well
done
tripel
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
nonetheless
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
1
a
bottle
but
not
at
all
a
typical
example
of
the
style
o
not
the
best
trippel
but
still
enjoyable
like
their
dubbel
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
overall
i
cant
even
believe
this
is
a
7
8
beer
it
seems
much
too
light
to
be
a
tripel
but
not
too
hard
to
put
onto
people
who
want
a
light
easy
to
drink
beer
i
still
enjoyed
it
but
not
the
type
of
beer
i
was
looking
for
with
trippel
being
labeled
on
the
front
maybe
i
dont
remember
having
this
beer
before
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
i
nice
gateway
to
the
belgian
tripel
style
on
tape
at
my
watering
hole
old
chicago
westminster
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
quarter
inch
white
head
that
quickly
disapated
aroma
of
malt
fresh
baked
breadyeast
and
some
caramel
taste
is
where
this
ones
at
maltbread
yeast
a
bit
of
caramel
with
a
cleancrisp
finish
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favs
from
nb
definitely
better
on
draft
d
a
solid
example
of
a
tripel
at
an
economical
price
thats
very
easy
to
find
this
is
a
great
benefit
and
one
i
purchase
regularly
overall
i
would
drink
it
again
if
you
offered
it
to
me
for
free
for
all
of
its
flaws
it
goes
down
easily
its
not
a
bad
drink
its
just
a
bad
drink
for
its
style
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
despite
it
doesnt
match
up
to
its
belgian
counterparts
it
is
a
great
value
at
8
99
for
a
six
pack
nice
flow
into
my
glass
resulting
in
a
two
finger
head
of
dense
off
white
to
very
light
yellow
foam
lace
is
a
little
broken
but
has
a
good
cling
color
is
a
6
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
with
clear
presentation
and
lots
of
micro
bubbles
smell
is
heavenly
with
the
almost
overpowering
aroma
of
peaches
there
are
also
fragrances
of
melon
lime
peel
and
flowers
i
wish
the
taste
was
a
good
as
the
smell
but
it
was
a
muted
version
with
flavors
of
peaches
slightly
sour
oranges
maybe
tangelos
something
in
there
is
like
swiss
cheese
and
a
whips
of
grapefruit
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
potent
explosion
of
carbonation
there
is
a
slight
coating
of
sweet
sticky
phlegm
in
the
back
of
my
throat
but
it
is
sort
of
pleasing
over
all
this
was
a
great
journey
and
the
buzz
is
just
what
i
needed
if
i
see
the
label
again
i
will
most
certainly
put
it
in
my
shopping
vessel
i
thought
this
beer
was
alright
ive
had
la
fin
du
monde
and
that
was
a
far
superior
tripel
this
beer
is
decent
for
the
price
but
i
recommend
their
abbey
over
this
one
paired
with
spicy
pepperjack
which
combined
to
make
a
nice
sharp
bitterness
new
belgium
absolutely
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
park
a
great
belgian
imitation
an
absolute
steal
at
8
bucks
for
a
sixer
overall
im
not
overly
impressed
with
this
brew
it
is
drinkable
but
im
not
so
sure
ill
want
to
do
that
very
often
overall
as
nbt
stands
currently
at
7
8
alcohol
its
ultimately
lighter
in
body
and
alcohol
and
less
cloying
than
many
other
tripels
im
down
with
that
i
will
stand
up
for
new
belgium
trippel
a
competent
trippel
but
not
much
more
taste
was
light
with
little
aftertaste
that
sweetens
as
it
warms
poured
light
yellowamber
with
a
small
13
head
that
dissipated
over
time
nice
floral
belgium
smell
munich
hops
light
floral
alcohol
taste
with
a
nice
warming
of
the
stomach
and
not
to
overpowering
this
is
a
great
low
cost
belgian
and
better
than
some
of
the
more
expensive
belgian
style
beers
i
have
tried
lately
revisited
and
review
tweaked
in
sept
2012
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
not
necessarily
a
great
one
d
excellent
i
would
love
another
but
a
little
too
strong
to
put
down
a
6
pack
in
a
evening
but
a
great
beer
note
the
label
touts
bottle
conditioned
but
dont
make
any
cellaring
plans
i
naively
stashed
some
of
these
away
for
a
while
but
even
after
just
6
months
they
tasted
awful
overallbought
this
as
a
single
not
knowing
what
to
get
but
i
was
actually
impressed
definitely
not
the
best
trippel
by
any
means
but
for
1
79
cant
go
wrong
i
enjoyed
it
more
then
i
thought
i
would
poured
a
very
transparent
golden
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
fluffy
white
head
on
it
good
lacing
as
well
great
malt
aroma
with
really
good
floral
notes
nice
crisp
refreshing
bite
on
this
beer
yeast
taste
up
front
good
citrus
and
floral
malt
taste
as
well
some
alcohol
coming
through
on
the
taste
but
not
terrible
pretty
smooth
drinking
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
it
wouldnt
mind
going
for
this
one
again
overall
a
decent
tripel
and
very
reasonably
price
however
it
wont
blow
you
away
like
other
tripels
that
are
also
widely
available
will
d
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
good
belgian
style
beer
as
well
id
like
to
try
more
in
this
style
to
have
a
bit
more
context
prosit
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
tripels
but
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
certainly
plan
to
explore
the
style
consumed
on
3
23
11
during
the
last
month
of
freshness
according
to
the
bottle
noted
date
of
27mar11
into
a
tulip
glass
this
reveals
a
bright
and
somewhat
clear
yellow
gold
color
allowing
the
sediment
from
the
bottle
into
my
glass
under
a
light
but
persistent
foamy
head
moderate
aroma
is
a
mostly
yeasty
one
with
a
sweet
lemon
ester
echoing
belgian
yeast
and
bright
malt
politely
makes
its
way
all
over
my
palate
and
seems
to
get
smoother
and
more
distinguishable
with
every
sip
notes
of
lemon
rind
light
coriander
and
bready
malt
resonate
in
the
aftertaste
i
could
sip
through
several
of
these
notes
not
a
bad
brew
and
if
one
is
on
the
style
it
is
pleasing
and
quaffable
but
for
me
this
is
certainly
on
the
weaker
side
of
new
belgiums
offerings
d
drinks
pretty
easily
despite
the
higher
abv
i
normally
stop
at
one
because
the
sweetness
starts
to
get
to
me
drinkability
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
lot
of
beers
as
drinkable
as
this
in
its
abv
range
without
leaving
the
us
great
beer
and
easy
as
hell
to
drink
and
definitely
something
i
want
to
come
back
to
and
share
with
friends
another
day
this
is
a
poormans
chimay
in
a
chimay
glass
for
effect
pours
golden
amber
with
a
light
whitish
head
that
dissipates
quickly
light
fruit
belgian
yeast
and
phenols
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
thin
notes
of
beligian
sugar
the
yeast
coriander
with
a
crisp
finish
when
i
say
crisp
i
dont
mean
hops
it
ends
with
a
carbonationy
crispness
like
carbonated
water
its
not
a
bad
thing
d
fairly
high
but
at
7
8
abv
it
could
catch
up
to
you
quicker
than
youd
expect
what
other
tripel
is
this
good
at
this
price
try
and
find
one
huge
citrus
nose
on
this
one
very
pungent
with
orange
peel
and
lemon
zest
clearly
represented
on
top
on
a
nice
belgian
ale
some
light
notes
of
grass
peaches
and
maybe
some
light
grain
all
coming
together
quite
nicely
to
provide
a
well
balanced
attack
on
the
senses
the
flavor
was
just
as
solid
here
rich
notes
of
biting
citrus
just
came
ripping
through
your
tongue
shredding
the
taste
buds
initially
before
relaxing
into
a
mellow
but
still
highly
floral
belgian
ale
some
light
notes
from
the
alcohol
and
the
yeast
started
to
peak
through
as
it
warmed
hinting
at
some
depth
letting
it
come
close
to
room
temp
is
where
you
really
start
to
find
that
depth
some
light
grain
like
malts
hints
of
peaches
and
bananas
and
just
an
all
out
really
nice
profile
one
of
the
brightest
tasting
belgian
ales
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
medium
bodied
feel
was
never
dull
with
a
more
then
adequate
carbonation
profile
that
was
just
wonderful
a
sure
fired
sipper
i
enjoyed
this
one
tremendously
over
the
course
of
the
evening
a
golden
color
that
reminded
me
of
the
beers
i
used
to
drink
smell
of
carmel
and
chocolate
taste
of
strong
chocolate
mouthful
is
a
feeling
like
no
other
goes
down
very
smooth
and
drinkabity
is
a
wonderful
for
a
day
of
crinking
with
the
good
friends
d
goes
down
easily
with
the
light
body
overall
not
a
bad
tripel
by
any
means
though
its
flavors
are
all
a
bit
muted
making
it
seem
more
a
witbier
than
a
tripel
still
it
manages
to
pull
off
the
light
and
crisp
body
where
many
american
takes
on
the
style
fail
and
for
that
alone
i
have
to
give
it
credit
only
costing
10
for
a
sixer
helps
too
this
beer
used
to
be
truly
in
the
trippel
style
and
used
to
be
great
it
was
so
disappointing
when
new
belgium
ruined
their
previously
outstanding
and
true
to
styel
trippel
by
adding
coriander
to
it
while
it
is
still
a
drinkable
beer
it
is
no
longer
the
outstanding
and
wonderful
true
to
style
trippel
it
used
to
be
they
should
rename
it
something
else
and
bring
back
the
old
trippel
personally
ill
seldom
by
by
this
beer
again
only
if
i
make
fish
or
shell
fish
with
coriander
where
i
used
to
buy
24
6
packs
depending
on
price
whenever
the
grocery
store
i
usually
go
to
had
it
drinkability
is
good
i
dont
really
love
this
on
exactly
but
it
is
ok
too
bad
this
isnt
less
sweet
and
the
mushroom
thing
needs
to
go
away
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
hits
the
style
right
on
the
bullseye
i
think
when
a
lot
of
people
think
of
a
belgian
ale
they
are
looking
for
the
deeper
complexities
and
richness
of
the
dark
ales
but
trippels
are
lighter
and
crisper
with
a
little
more
carbonation
evident
well
done
new
belgium
to
me
this
is
a
pretty
average
craft
beer
overall
i
dont
think
it
stacks
up
compared
to
real
belgian
trippels
the
abv
is
about
where
it
should
be
but
the
distinctive
sweetness
and
punchiness
of
the
herbs
arent
there
i
could
smell
the
coriander
when
i
sniffed
it
but
i
didnt
get
a
hint
of
it
when
i
drank
it
that
said
its
a
decent
beer
but
of
the
nb
products
i
like
1554
and
fat
tire
a
little
better
and
having
had
a
few
dubbels
and
trippels
in
my
day
this
just
seems
like
a
light
version
of
those
dr
id
definitely
have
it
again
especially
considering
its
price
and
abv
d
very
easy
refreshing
drinker
considering
the
abv
jd
d
i
would
love
to
start
the
night
off
with
one
of
these
everytime
i
drink
good
stuff
drinkability
this
beer
was
my
gateway
into
trying
more
belgian
beers
its
a
yearround
goto
beer
for
me
the
complex
and
wellbalanced
flavor
almost
completely
masks
the
fact
this
is
a
7
8
abv
beer
glad
they
put
this
in
6packs
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
almost
completely
clear
with
no
color
medium
white
head
that
diminishes
fairly
quickly
scent
is
very
sweet
with
strong
coriander
and
bubble
gum
im
not
sure
if
ive
used
bubblegum
as
an
aroma
descriptor
before
but
this
for
sure
has
it
strong
bubblegum
hint
of
banana
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
very
complex
with
that
bubblegum
flavor
and
clove
i
love
how
this
beer
tastes
you
get
a
completely
balanced
variety
of
pepper
coriander
clove
bubblegum
belgian
yeast
banana
and
light
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
doesnt
necessarily
have
that
feel
i
like
in
a
genuine
belgian
tripel
drinkability
is
high
and
abv
is
scarily
wellhidden
overall
a
great
beer
and
starter
for
people
getting
into
belgian
triples
just
not
a
close
enough
example
of
a
genuine
one
this
is
a
very
good
take
on
a
belgian
trippel
in
a
decidedly
new
belgium
style
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
gold
and
has
a
bold
smell
of
yeast
the
taste
is
almost
onedimensional
in
the
presence
of
what
i
would
call
a
classic
sourbready
belgian
yeast
flavor
just
hints
of
more
complexity
on
the
back
end
with
sugars
floral
hops
and
milder
yet
notes
of
citrus
i
mark
this
down
for
a
sticky
aftertaste
of
spent
yeast
flavor
pour
was
light
clear
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
was
of
pepper
herbs
earth
floral
esters
and
some
banana
flavors
were
well
blended
with
some
banana
bread
pepper
spice
and
light
orange
body
was
medium
to
light
and
this
was
an
easy
drink
nice
brew
trippel
is
good
and
with
a
couple
tweaks
could
be
very
good
well
worth
trying
and
a
nice
complement
to
their
to
me
superior
abbey
dubbel
this
is
the
first
trippel
ive
had
and
right
off
the
bat
i
noticed
what
an
interesting
style
this
is
ive
also
noticed
that
a
lot
of
imported
breweries
feature
this
brew
i
will
definitely
be
trying
this
again
for
it
is
a
brew
that
you
have
to
experience
for
yourself
i
highly
reccomend
you
go
out
and
get
some
similar
to
the
belgian
white
its
not
for
everyone
also
some
might
like
a
coriander
beer
with
citrus
just
like
the
witbier
overall
nice
brew
keeps
you
warm
which
is
why
its
in
the
folly
pack
poured
into
a
new
belgium
snifter
its
funny
how
that
works
out
it
poured
a
very
thin
golden
almost
straw
yellow
with
a
one
finger
poofy
white
head
it
looks
incredibly
light
for
a
tripel
its
very
clear
and
doesnt
offer
any
cloudiness
the
smell
is
pretty
bland
too
it
smells
like
a
weak
dortmunder
and
nothing
like
a
tripel
wheres
the
coriander
the
yeast
at
least
the
flavor
is
a
little
better
here
you
get
some
coriander
a
full
creamy
yeasty
flavor
with
a
mild
sweetness
followed
by
breadyness
its
solid
but
nothing
too
special
it
drinks
thicker
than
it
looks
but
it
looks
extremely
thin
its
light
to
medium
bodied
in
consistency
its
ok
and
just
ok
in
all
fields
im
certainly
glad
i
didnt
buy
an
entire
six
pack
im
a
big
fan
of
new
belgium
but
this
is
not
one
of
my
favs
i
think
that
it
is
the
smell
that
turns
me
off
because
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
d
maybe
this
is
typical
of
the
style
but
this
beer
is
deep
spicy
and
with
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
and
tries
to
finish
crisp
and
dry
but
instead
of
doing
that
with
flavor
and
refreshment
it
kicks
you
in
the
butt
on
the
way
out
with
alcohol
trippels
got
character
but
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
a
couple
of
these
d
wow
new
belgium
which
i
think
is
pretty
good
shocked
me
this
is
quite
good
and
you
need
to
give
it
a
chance
high
chance
of
taking
down
more
than
a
few
yum
d
dangerously
easydrinking
its
not
bad
but
there
are
so
many
better
beers
of
this
style
i
have
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
for
a
while
although
not
a
new
belgium
fan
in
general
even
with
the
high
abv
its
very
drinkable
drinkability
was
good
semi
sessionable
even
for
a
strong
beer
price
wise
this
is
one
of
the
most
affordable
tripels
but
quality
wise
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
best
in
its
style
drinkability
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
delicate
complex
and
a
little
funky
and
with
an
alcohol
character
that
walks
a
fine
line
in
fact
its
almost
too
easy
drinking
definitely
better
than
i
had
anticipated
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
this
beer
is
no
slouch
i
could
see
this
being
a
gateway
belgianstyle
beer
d
this
is
a
decent
representative
of
the
style
final
word
a
very
enjoyable
brew
especially
considering
the
price
tag
ill
certainly
buy
it
again
was
just
a
little
spicy
and
maybe
not
quite
sweet
enough
for
the
style
but
definitely
a
very
solid
offering
from
nb
i
loved
this
brew
and
respect
what
the
makers
have
created
at
7
8
a
robust
and
complex
beer
and
also
very
drinkable
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
best
before
103011
pours
a
bright
clear
golden
yellow
with
two
fingers
of
lumpy
foam
lots
of
carbonation
can
be
seen
very
nice
lacing
banana
some
orange
citrus
and
coriander
on
the
nose
medium
body
with
slightly
low
carbonation
carbonation
a
little
different
malt
character
than
the
great
trippels
it
has
some
of
that
same
roasted
malt
character
that
fat
tire
has
only
a
lot
less
not
as
clean
and
crisp
as
you
might
like
but
still
very
good
banana
and
honey
expressions
in
the
light
and
sweet
malt
this
is
super
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
definitely
kick
back
one
or
two
of
these
and
still
have
room
for
something
else
d
at
nearly
8
this
drinks
very
easily
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
too
i
purchased
a
variety
pack
before
christmas
and
this
has
been
the
only
beer
i
have
enjoyed
of
the
bunch
notes
not
bad
not
as
good
as
other
trippels
but
a
good
brew
none
the
less
7
49
well
spent
tonight
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
character
with
a
full
but
well
blended
coriander
flavor
but
it
is
not
overly
spiced
the
beer
is
light
and
dry
and
has
some
nice
supporting
flavor
making
this
a
well
rounded
tripel
while
this
is
not
as
potent
as
a
traditional
belgian
or
euro
triple
this
is
the
best
offering
the
u
s
has
had
in
the
triple
category
for
a
long
time
this
beer
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
euro
counterparts
but
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
pour
minimal
head
and
carbonation
a
sugary
malty
aroma
and
leaves
a
slight
tinge
of
bitterness
on
the
tongue
d
drinkable
tripel
for
sure
i
prefer
tripels
on
the
sweeter
side
and
this
was
right
there
not
quite
as
complex
a
taste
as
some
of
the
best
but
this
is
a
good
beer
i
was
bit
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
character
and
overall
flavour
these
new
belgium
beers
are
clean
and
crisp
to
a
fault
sometimes
the
label
states
that
its
bottle
conditioned
but
i
dont
see
anything
in
the
glass
that
supports
this
claim
solid
but
stoic
in
nature
just
not
memorable
in
any
way
although
i
have
had
lessthanpleasant
experiences
with
coriander
flavored
beer
in
the
past
i
must
admit
that
this
was
quite
enjoyable
the
coriander
flavor
is
very
mild
and
the
beer
itself
is
quite
good
perhaps
a
bit
too
strong
for
a
decent
session
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
not
the
best
beer
in
the
style
but
its
worth
drinking
for
a
little
while
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
one
the
appearance
and
aroma
were
fantastic
but
the
flavor
really
turned
me
off
between
the
alcohol
and
the
phenolics
this
one
was
harsh
and
not
terribly
drinkable
i
probably
wont
be
picking
this
up
anytime
it
was
not
my
idea
of
a
good
triple
very
sweet
thin
and
boring
those
tiny
hints
of
weak
yeast
dont
cut
it
for
a
triple
they
tried
to
compensate
with
the
coriander
but
fell
short
i
guess
not
everything
can
be
awesome
i
still
love
this
brewery
though
reviewed
on
4302010
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
semihazy
golden
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
spices
sweet
fruits
bready
malt
flavor
is
sweet
initially
with
a
spicy
bready
finish
nice
spice
presence
very
drinkable
very
flavorful
great
trippel
d
seems
like
a
decent
example
of
a
trippel
style
but
nothing
unique
or
great
about
the
beer
to
me
this
beer
is
a
poor
example
of
the
style
so
i
was
exceptionally
disappointed
when
i
had
my
first
taste
the
appearance
is
light
and
golden
with
a
thin
head
and
not
nearly
as
captivating
as
true
trippels
the
aroma
is
pungent
and
akin
to
what
id
expect
from
a
miller
lite
if
it
were
home
brewed
which
means
better
than
the
macrostyle
with
a
little
bit
of
that
classic
heineken
skunky
smell
probably
the
coriander
the
beer
has
a
mild
velvetly
sweetness
to
it
with
distinguished
abrasrasive
and
noncomplex
pilsner
malt
and
coriander
flavors
they
obviously
didnt
use
an
abbey
yeast
for
this
im
actually
quite
disgusted
with
this
beer
and
i
love
most
beers
with
the
exception
of
brown
ales
which
i
do
not
prefer
but
thats
just
my
preference
i
feel
quite
conflicted
posting
such
a
poor
review
as
others
seem
to
enjoy
this
brew
so
take
it
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
if
you
are
used
to
anything
even
remotely
similar
to
the
chimay
trippel
you
will
be
dissapointed
d
good
beer
definitely
something
i
thought
i
would
not
enjoy
but
was
pleasantly
pleased
to
find
out
that
it
was
so
good
i
m
not
normally
a
fan
of
coriander
spiced
beers
but
this
one
takes
the
cake
and
probably
something
you
can
enjoy
with
a
piece
of
as
well
big
fan
of
this
brewery
hoping
to
try
some
more
before
i
depart
tx
drinkability
given
the
devils
backbone
i
just
had
it
doesnt
stack
up
well
to
it
i
dont
think
id
crate
this
beer
again
though
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
d
high
marks
for
drinkability
at
7
8
you
could
actually
drink
a
few
of
these
unlike
most
trippels
all
considered
its
a
cleantasting
easydrinking
beer
basically
an
ok
at
best
tripel
nowhere
near
as
good
as
a
true
belgian
tripel
and
probably
the
weakest
of
the
us
made
ones
i
have
had
bottles
date
is
20feb11
d
very
drinkable
the
high
alcohol
makes
it
a
sipper
but
a
delicious
one
overall
a
very
nice
drink
but
it
would
be
nicer
if
they
hid
the
alcohol
more
this
classic
belgian
abbeystyle
ale
with
a
redesigned
label
initially
pours
an
unimpressive
pale
gold
but
the
thick
head
and
dense
nose
brings
to
mind
cinnamon
ripe
fruity
banana
and
clovecoriander
the
taste
is
a
bumrush
of
spice
up
front
followed
by
a
mellow
maltiness
then
a
stronger
alcohol
sting
its
7
8
a
perfect
example
of
this
style
and
made
in
america
new
belgiums
trippel
is
a
delightful
and
delicious
beer
d
not
a
bad
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
sometime
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
think
they
filtered
the
beer
way
too
much
it
says
its
bottle
conditioned
but
i
didnt
get
any
haze
at
all
overall
its
okay
the
most
i
could
drink
is
probably
about
12
12oz
bottles
and
thats
it
i
dont
recommend
this
beer
at
all
and
id
pass
for
something
else
i
cant
say
im
much
of
a
fan
of
the
belgian
yeast
in
beers
but
putting
my
personal
preferences
aside
this
seems
to
be
a
solid
tripel
worthy
of
a
bb
certainly
nothing
exciting
about
it
though
worth
trying
for
yourself
at
the
very
least
drink
i
cant
get
these
in
ca
except
on
draft
and
i
only
have
two
left
maybe
its
time
to
go
back
to
denver
the
beer
is
a
clear
pale
yellow
the
head
did
not
last
long
but
im
gonna
guess
its
cause
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
hints
of
belgian
candi
sugar
with
a
slight
hint
of
coriander
there
is
a
little
bit
of
an
alochol
taste
in
the
beginning
but
it
quickly
turns
to
a
sweet
taste
looking
at
the
recipe
you
do
get
hints
of
baking
bread
with
the
victory
malt
and
an
extra
sweetness
with
the
munich
malt
it
is
very
interesting
that
they
use
liberty
hops
i
have
always
wanted
to
try
brewing
with
them
the
hop
taste
is
low
but
it
is
noble
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
new
belgium
trippel
was
light
gold
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
it
had
a
very
large
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
spice
and
fruit
the
taste
was
good
with
sweetness
from
the
candi
sugar
yeast
flavors
and
spices
coriander
the
finish
was
semidry
with
just
touch
of
throat
warming
alcohol
it
was
medium
bodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
good
trippel
and
worth
trying
d
may
not
have
another
its
a
strong
ale
and
a
bit
overdone
3
5
poured
into
a
tulip
pours
a
moderate
yellowgold
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
fairly
decent
amount
of
lacing
nose
brings
some
alcohol
slight
spicing
and
a
bit
of
light
fruit
the
taste
brings
some
pale
malt
as
well
as
spice
and
alcohol
spice
and
booze
mix
fairly
well
in
the
feel
but
overall
this
one
just
wasnt
ready
and
didnt
live
up
to
the
standards
of
the
style
i
could
definitely
session
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
its
alright
definitely
not
a
choice
trippel
but
for
a
sixer
for
9
bucks
its
an
ok
deal
d
good
drinkability
the
beer
for
me
goes
a
little
down
with
drinkability
once
it
warms
up
and
the
alcohol
becomes
more
present
overall
a
good
rep
of
the
style
but
lacks
the
adventure
i
think
they
were
going
for
appearance
is
a
very
clear
light
golden
color
smells
are
banana
and
spice
right
off
the
bat
a
very
strong
yeast
scent
flavor
is
banana
slight
hints
of
spices
maybe
allspice
mouthfeel
is
medium
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
but
i
thought
this
one
was
pretty
good
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
thick
layer
of
pillowy
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
potent
blend
of
honey
caramelized
sugars
wheat
and
yeast
initial
palate
of
hops
and
toasted
malt
along
with
honey
banana
orange
spice
and
smoooth
alcohol
theres
also
a
faint
coriander
for
which
i
expected
more
of
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
dry
fruity
finish
an
excellent
beer
that
packs
a
punch
hmmm
i
remember
this
being
better
the
first
time
i
tried
it
regardless
still
another
impressive
beer
from
new
belgium
brewing
inc
medium
body
some
smoothness
but
punctuated
by
crisp
phenols
and
astringency
which
also
have
the
effect
of
thinning
out
the
body
at
times
tingly
carbonation
both
crisp
and
fluffy
carbonation
is
good
without
being
excessive
and
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
crisp
drinkability
is
where
this
brew
really
shines
as
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
if
i
wasnt
careful
d
for
7
8
this
baby
goes
down
easy
a
success
d
the
high
carbonation
make
this
quite
drinkable
despite
the
higher
alcohol
a
nice
representation
of
style
especially
the
flavor
profile
the
coriander
seemed
to
only
show
up
in
any
substantial
amount
in
the
aroma
probably
faded
fast
usually
i
do
not
agree
with
the
idea
of
adjuncts
in
a
beer
but
in
this
case
it
works
its
light
and
crisp
while
still
having
moderate
alcohol
and
most
importantly
lots
of
flavor
glad
i
still
have
4
left
of
the
six
pack
but
they
arent
going
to
last
long
it
is
an
ok
trippel
maybe
i
expected
a
little
more
from
new
belgium
thats
love
after
the
initial
shock
from
the
spices
the
beer
becomes
very
quaffable
but
shouldnt
be
taken
lightly
as
the
7
8
abv
will
kick
in
faster
than
you
can
predict
this
is
a
very
tasty
tripel
im
very
impressed
with
new
belgium
as
usual
this
could
definitely
be
a
go
to
beer
as
far
as
tripels
go
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
no
hints
of
sediment
even
though
it
says
bottle
conditioned
on
the
label
smells
of

taste
is
light
grain
up
front
with
a
sour
apple
middle
and
a
dry
medicinal
bitterness
in
the
finish
hint
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
decent
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
light
and
refreshing
overall
a
good
beer
but
compared
to
most
tripels
it
falls
a
bit
short
overall
this
was
a
very
boring
beer
and
not
much
flavor
at
all
mddidnt
leave
a
spectacular
taste
in
the
mouth
but
surely
a
mild
sweetness
goes
down
smooth
and
i
intend
to
knock
down
a
few
more
bottles
this
evening
overall
not
that
bad
it
looked
like
a
lager
but
tasted
like
an
ale
i
would
not
have
guessed
this
was
a
trippel
belgian
style
ale
though
worth
a
try
and
i
would
buy
it
again
if
it
were
on
sale
and
i
was
having
trouble
sleeping
my
favorite
from

is
still

good
tripel
that
is
slightly

by
a

putting
all
of

this

is

each
drinkability
the
only
big
hit
on
this
one
big
prominent
alcohol
a
bt
syrupy
and
the
massive
sweetness
and
the
big
coriander
are
both
a
bit
wearing
in
their
own
right
even
if
they
do
balance
each
other
somewhat
not
a
bad
tripel
at
all
and
what
it
lacks
in
subtlety
it
makes
up
for
in
flavor
though
not
entirely
final
notes
a
delicious
well
balanced
beer
for
multiple
different
occasions
and
food
pairings
big
flavor
and
complex
highly
recommended
taste
wise
it
is
a
bit
like
biting
into
an
under
ripe
orange
but
cut
with
a
little
hint
of
sugar
its
spicy
crisp
and
warm
i
like
this
beer
but
i
would
classify
this
one
more
closer
in
style
to
duvel
but
im
no
expert
cheers
d
this
is
some
really
tasty
stuff
i
was
worried
about
the
coriander
but
it
played
a
nice
backup
role
to
the
malt
yeast
and
alcohol
well
balanced
a
very
good
sipper
p
s
their
abbey
style
is
not
even
close
dont
confuse
it
with
their
trippel
drinkability
average
for
the
style
at
best
some
spice
at
both
ends
of
the
spice
spectrum
like
from
nutmeg
to
the
hot
kind
alcohol
was
a
little
too
hot
for
my
wishes
really
just
tastes
like
an
imperial
hefewitbier
if
thats
your
kind
of
thing
its
probably
made
decently
but
the
absence
of
any
real
appreciable
malt
or
hop
character
make
this
is
a
tough
sell
the
yeast
strain
was
ok
but
had
a
disagreeable
tartness
to
it
if
you
are
looking
for
the
real
deal
start
with
a
duvel
or
tripel
karmeliet
and
if
you
know
beer
and
this
style
avoid
this
rip
off
d
well
i
made
it
through
3
of
6
bottles
but
with
that
have
reached
my
lifetime
limit
i
see
no
reason
to
drink
this
beer
when
there
are
hundreds
of
better
belgian
style
tripples
out
there
most
of
which
are
refreshing
complex
and
rewarding
d
4
5
very
easy
drinking
the
balance
and
straightforward
demeanor
make
this
one
of
those
you
need
to
make
an
effort
to
avoid
downing
too
quickl
d
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
tripels
around
imo
it
tastes
very
authentic
features
bold
flavors
and
is
expertly
balanced
plus
it
is
one
of
the
best
value

drinkability
a
nice
example
of
a
tripel
brewed
with
spices
in
this
case
the
flavors
worked
well
together
and
i
would
like
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
hand
at
all
times
drinkability
would
maybe
buy
this
once
more
to
try
it
again
and
see
if
the
taste
is
better
the
next
time
pretty
drinkable
ill
certainly
buy
it
again
fitting
in
with
my
preferences
and
liking
for
belgian
style
beers
drinks
well
d
id
definitely
buy
it
again
solid
session
beer
if
you
dont
like
coriander
this
probably
isnt
for
you
d
this
one
wouldnt
impress
the
true
connoisseurs
of
belgian
style
beers
but
its
a
decent
attempt
from
an
american
brewer
id
drink
another
sometime
d
easy
drink
the
only
problem
is
7
8
alc
which
catches
up
to
you
but
it
is
a
belgium
trippel
which
i
love
drinkablity
i
do
like
this
brew
a
lot
and
have
had
many
6
packs
and
bombers
of
it
for
what
i
crave
and
the
budget
im
on
it
really
is
a
damn
good
beer
nice
golden
pour
with
lots
of
frothy
white
head
and
sticky
lacing
fairly
generic
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
heavy
with
bread
and
banana
taste
was
also
pleasant
with
plenty
of
banana
clove
and
yeast
quick
finish
with
a
bit
of
lingering
sweet
malt
nothing
stood
out
in
particular
but
the
belgian
style
is
captured
well
without
becoming
too
heavy
or
sweet
very
drinkable
without
being
particularly
memorable
note
the
people
giving
this
beer
low
marks
here
appear
to
be
beer
neophytes
who
dontcant
appreciate
this
unique
style
i
was
disappointed
in
this
offering
i
shoulda
just
bought
a
few
westmalle
tripple
i
guess
i
was
expecting
this
to
come
somewhat
close
but
it
wasnt
even
in
the
same
ballpark
our
trippel
belgian
style
ale
pronounced
triple
opens
with
a
bold
blast
of
hops
that
slowly
gives
way
to
the
fruity
esters
implied
by
our
belgian
yeast
strain
in
the
belgian
tradition
of
brewing
singles
doubles
and
triples
trippel
is
the
strongest
with
the
longest
fermentation
remarkably
smooth
and
complex
our
bottleconditioned
trippel
is
spiced
with
a
trace
of
coriander
overall
for
an
american
version
this
is
a
great
tripel
overall
it
is
spicy
and
lively
where
it
needs
to
be
but
still
retains
a
malt
base
to
keep
things
even
the
alcohol
could
be
more
hidden
and
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
tad
smoother
this
is
another
good
one
from
new
belgium
not
as
mindblowing
as
other
triples
but
dangnear
jawdropping
when
you
consider
the
low
price
dont
sleep
on
this
one
if
youre
a
trippletriple
lover
i
dont
know
if
this
really
on
style
but
for
the
price
and
complexity
all
i
know
is
i
love
drinking
this
beer
overall
very
unimpressed
and
disappointed
in
this
beer
full
of
flavor
which
i
dont
mind
but
the
flavor
just
seems
off
to
me
md
lighter
body
medium
to
high
carbonation
very
average
drinkability
is
average
the
coriander
is
a
little
much
im
usually
pretty
skeptical
about
belgian
style
ales
in
six
packs
but
this
one
is
true
to
the
style
a
very
quality
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
a
fizzy
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
decent
mild
tripel
d
an
easy
drinking
trippel
but
certainly
not
one
of
the
better
ones
worth
a
try
nice
offering
from
a
quality
brewery
side
note
i
remember
having
this
a
few
years
back
at
the
brewery
on
tap
and
it
was
much
better
surprise
surprise
if
i
encounter
this
again
on
tap
will
revise
my
review
nice
effervescence
leaves
the
beer
bouncing
around
the
palate
without
being
stingy
pours
a
very
deep
goldenorange
color
with
very
little
head
a
very
floral
aroma
with
fruits
and
spiced
hops
very
complex
a
crisp
clean
taste
which
is
refreshing
a
little
bit
of
spice
in
the
taste
mixed
with
alcohol
up
front
is
sweet
with
a
finish
that
is
sort
of
biting
from
the
hops
one
of
my
favorites
from
new
belgium
actually
one
of
my
top
ten
d
average
i
suppose
for
a
beer
without
a
lot
happening
its
still
refreshing
and
light
and
it
doesnt
taste
bad
compared
to
the
abbey
though
this
aint
that
great
drinkability
what
i
found
is
the
closer
the
beer
got
to
room
temp
the
less
i
wanted
to
drink
it
to
me
a
triple
is
high
abv
but
light
this
beer
has
a
lower
abv
and
heavier
mouthfeeldrinkability
d
somewhat
bland
and
one
dimensional
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
extremely
complex
in
flavor
and
meets
all
of
the
requirements
of
this
beer
style
d
solid
trippel
that
is
high
on
flavor
and
even
higher
on
drinkability
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
go
down
really
easily
and
even
though
its
only
7
8
the
alcohol
seems
completely
nonexistent
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
but
id
reach
for
it
when
i
could
very
enjoyable
beer
indeed
and
a
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
well
im
not
a
fan
of
new
belgium
to
begin
with
but
i
thought
id
give
them
another
try
since
it
was
3
49
for
this
22oz
bottle
not
impressed
at
all
i
dont
think
ill
even
be
able
to
finish
the
bottle
im
really
confused
since
i
know
that
a
lot
of
people
like
them
nowadays
so
am
i
getting
bad
bottles
or
something
truly
awful
the
rest
of
the
bottle
is
either
going
down
the
drain
or
serving
as
the
base
for
a
marinade
i
take
that
back
its
going
down
the
drain
d
a
real
nice
tripel
definitely
an
american
version
the
complexity
isnt
huge
but
i
liked
it
d
a
nice
drinkable
tripel
good
flavors
and
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
beer
at
a
good
price
but
dont
expect
miracles
good
job
new
belgium
d
i
only
had
one
but
wished
i
bought
more
d
this
could
be
a
session
beer
perhaps
im
too
extreme
but
this
beer
is
rather
light
on
the
palette
slainte
but
with
something
else
overall
drinkable
nice
complexity
alcohol
is
evident
but
for
the
abv
is
hidden
somewhat
in
this
beer
md
silky
creamy
feel
with
faint
carbonation
sticky
on
the
lips
alcohol
warmth
it
goes
down
easily
but
the
alcohol
definitely
decreases
drinkability
poured
into
a
goblet
a
deep
golden
yellow
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
white
head
that
retained
well
and
laced
pretty
well
aromas
were
of
banana
spicy
and
some
alcohol
taste
was
a
bit
grainy
with
some
spice
and
the
fruitiness
feel
was
a
slightly
chewy
medium
bodied
beer
with
some
crispness
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
as
a
beautiful
local
option
for
the
style
nice
to
keep
a
6er
around
for
when
you
want
a
nice
belgian
but
dont
feel
like
you
want
to
concentrate
on
it
too
much
that
night
d
not
as
sweet
as
some
triples
but
not
as
complex
either
probably
wont
buy
again
not
a
bad
beer
except
for
maybe
the
aftertaste
but
there
are
much
better
trippels
out
there
still
a
nice
attempt
at
the
style
pours
a
lighter
golden
color
from
the
bottle
with
a
small
bubbly
head
carbonation
dances
as
bubbles
rise
in
the
glass
smell
is
good
has
a
slight
skunkiness
to
itnot
sure
if
this
is
an
old
beer
or
just
a
part
of
its
aroma
regardless
has
that
distinct
yeasty
aroma
to
it
almost
has
a
grape
aroma
to
it
its
very
unique
taste
is
great
just
has
an
awesome
flavor
the
high
carbonation
of
belgians
i
think
are
my
favorite
because
it
just
dances
on
the
tongue
and
i
like
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkabily
are
high
d
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
drinkable
there
is
a
flavor
that
i
cant
describe
im
not
well
versed
with
tripels
it
may
be
a
flavor
that
is
a
calling
card
of
this
style
nice
taste
and
lightmedium
body
make
it
a
rather
nice
brew
with
which
to
relax
my
personal
opinion
is
that
the
abv
is
too
high
for
a
session
appearance
has
a
nice
golden
color
with
little
head
but
good
lace
smell
has
a
good
dose
of
spice
with
tangarine
and
banana
taste
involves
spices
citrus
and
sweet
malt
in
the
end
the
alchohol
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
viscosity
and
carbonation
id
say
a
good
go
at
the
style
and
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
belgian
style
trippel
definitely
going
to
pick
these
more
often
when
i
get
a
belgian
kick
i
had
the
last
half
of
this
beer
with
some
pumpkin
pie
and
it
went
together
excellently
dprobably
would
not
drink
a
ton
of
these
but
certainly
worth
a
try
worthy
effort
by
a
solid
brewery

beers
d
this
is
quite
a
nice
tripel
for
an
american
brewery
the
abv
is
very
sneaky
in
this
one
i
think
this
is
perhaps
one
of
new
belgiums
best
offerings
d
definitely
a
beer
that
i
could
have
a

of
especially

will
starting

department
a
good

with

very
light
flavor
cheers
i
must
say
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
new
belgium
brews
they
usually
have
this
toasty
je
ne
sais
quoi
that
i
dont
really
like
this
beer
has
a
tiny
bit
of
it
but
overall
its
damn
good
and
by
far
easily
my
favorite
new
belgium
offering
edit
2
minutes
later
after
reading
jason
alstroms
review
he
conjures
some
of
the
flavors
that
i
could
not
it
is
growing
on
me
as
it
warms
and
i
understand
it
more
fully
i
stick
to
most
my
words
in
general
though
d
i
could
see
this
being
a
staple
beer
at
a
party
or
something
along
that
lines
in
addition
this
beer
would
be
a
great
beer
for
taking
those
pisswater
drinkers
into
the
world
of
great
beers
dthis
beer
drinks
very
well
for
such
a
big
beer
i
highly
suggest
this
beer
i
havent
seen
many
american
brewers
make
any
belgian
ales
up
to
par
that
being
said
this
one
isnt
that
offensive
but
it
is
like
a
tripel
light
very
drinkable
but
not
the
most
tasty
tripel
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
small
head
with
poor
retention
smells
of
cloves
bananas
citrus
and
some
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
light
body
not
what
i
would
normally
expect
a
trippel
to
taste
like
but
still
pretty
good
with
decent
to
good
drinkability
pale
golden
in
color
with
aromas
of
clove
bananas
and
light
bready
malts
taste
is
slightly

faint
banana
and
clove
presence
very
nice
toastedbiscuit
malts
subtle
use
of
noble
hops
and
a
short
sweet
finish
very
drinkable
clean
mouthfeel
with
lingering
aftertaste
after
reviewing
this
beer
im
going
to
the
fridge
to
crack
open
another
one
very
drinkable
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
style
it
has
a
light
body
smooth
with
a
bit
more
than
average
carbonation
but
i
poured
it
slow
so
that
might
be
why
dmoderate
i
was
overall
not
too
impressed
but
thats
my
opinion
i
think
this
could
be
a
very
accessible
representation
of
this
style
and
a
good
brew
with
which
to
introduce
a
person
to
belgianstyle
ales
although
it
isnt
fantastic
its
also
not
overwhelming
it
has
a
nice
brass
color
with
not
much
head
but
what
little
bit
of
head
it
does
have
there
is
a
good
bit
of
staying
power
there
are
a
lot
of
tiny
bubbles
in
the
body
it
has
beany
aroma
it
has
a
candy
like
taste
at
first
then
some
mild
hops
the
aftertaste
is
fruity
i
thought
it
was
weak
for
a
trippel
mouthfeeldrinkability
heavy
carbonation
and
very
crisp
comes
off
very
dry
i
was
surprised
by
this
because
i
never
expect
much
from
american
versions
of
belgian
style
beers
id
give
it
a
go
after
tweaking
and
whenif
they
get
it
right
this
could
become
a
regular
for
me
when
im
craving
a
belgian
beer
its
not
there
yet
but
i
remain
hopeful
drinkability
very
nice
a
better
hop
selection
might
aid
this
as
well
as
notching
the
grain
bill
down
a
few
ounces
cant
really
appreciate
the
taste
here
i
may
have
to
find
another
to
see
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
in
which
case
ill
rereview
based
on
the
merits
of
this
sample
i
am
definitley
moving
on
to
another
brew
in
fact
i
may
just
leave
this
one
unfinished
this
would
be
a
nice
introductory
beer
for
people
who
arent
familiar
with
belgian
tripels
it
offers
a
pretty
good
bang
for
your
buck
and
after
trying
this
and
finding
it
enjoyable
a
person
might
want
to
move
up
into
the
big
leagues
so
to
speak
and
try
a
true
belgian
tripel
id
have
this
one
again
but
only
if
i
found
myself
short
on
money
but
with
a
big
hankering
for
a
tripel
style
beer
drinkability
as
i
mentioned
above
i
think
i
like
this
more
than
i
should
theres
something
about
this
beer
that
comes
together
reasonably
well
its
traditional
in
many
ways
though
also
diverges
from
the
stereotypical
trippel
in
a
number
of
ways
both
good
and
bad
at
7
8
though
its
also
less
alcoholic
than
many
trippels
which
does
enhance
the
drinkability
somewhat
a
solid
beer
and
one
id
be
glad
to
have
again
good
tripel
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
new
belgium
d
refreshing
and
delicious
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
definately
enjoyed
this
brew
no
complaints
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
my
chimay
chalice
beer
is
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
sparkling
white
head
comprised
of
many
fine
bubbles
nose
is
fairly
underwhelming
a
light
fruitiness
and
some
spicy
banana
phenols
and
hints
of
fusel
alcohol
the
taste
has
a
general
smoothness
about
it
starts
out
neutral
and
transitions
to
a
mild
fruity
malt
sweetness
pears
and
white
grapes
and
then
moves
to
a
mild
bitterness
and
alcohol
bite
finishes
neutral
and
a
slightly
sweet
warming
alcohol
sensation
remains
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
fine
beaded
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
tripel
not
outstanding
but
decent
goes
down
smooth
and
at
7
8
should
be
respected
notes
this
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
le
fin
or
karmeleit
or
ommegang
or
countless
other
tripels
hence
the
b
grade
but
for
7
49
a
six
pack
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
d
i
was
quite
suprised
by
this
tripel
karmeliet
is
one
of
my
go
to
tripels
and
flat
earths
bermuda
triangle
is
probably
my
favorite
this
is
definitely
number
3
right
now
i
like
the
fact
that
the
yeast
isnt
overpowering
this
is
mainly
my
preference
however
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
d
easy
to
session
despite
relatively
high
abv
this
beer
is
a
no
brainer
for
the
pricestyle
why
are
you
still
reading
this
go
get
one
dability
light
tasting
but
alcohol
character
a
bit
too
prominent
for
the
style
and
for
drinkability
drinkability
decent
tripel
but
fell
a
bit
short
for
me
after
the
glass
was
emptied
i
didnt
want
another
drinkability
new
belgium
creates
another
winner
in
fort
collins
great
example
of
the
style
it
appears
a
warm
shade
of
gold
that
is
clear
like
apple
juice
im
a
little
disappointed
that
the
initial
head
has
dissipated
to
almost
nothing
leaving
behind
at
least
some
lacing
apple
and
spice
coriander
pepper
on
the
nose
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
the
star
featuring
apple
pear
peach
banana
tropical
fruits
honeysuckle
pepper
and
clove
the
alcohol
is
sensed
but
not
unwelcome
in
this
sipper
carbonation
is
a
little
low
this
one
asserts
itself
with
full
body
and
a
long
dry
finish
i
could
certainly
have
another
crisp
hops
some
fruity
esters
tropical
bananans
and
a
honey
sweetness
good
full
mouthfeel
not
lacking
in
that
department
for
sure
the
alcohol
is
at
a
happy
place
and
this
is
a
very
wellbalanced
brew
a
bit
more
dense
than
other
tripples
not
in
a
bad
way
just
different
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
covered
finishing
the
6
wil
lbe
enjoyable
and
done
fairly
quickly
d
i
have
been
having
a
hard
time
with
any
belgian
brews
lately
not
sure
what
the
deal
is
but
i
find
this
one
drinkable
and
in
the
average
category
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
introductory
beer
into
the
belgian
style
for
the
nonbelgian
lover
with
its
typical
americanized
flavors
not
as
good
as
i
would
expect
overall
its
still
a
bit
too
fizzy
for
me
but
it
is
an
above
par
tripel
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
and
an
ok
lacing
not
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
trippel
the
smell
is
nutty
and
bready
with
some
sweet
fruit
some
clove
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
nutty
and
fruity
some
bananas
its
also
malty
and
roasty
just
the
same
as
the
smel
not
a
true
trippel
l
its
easy
to
drink
the
7
8
abv
is
well
hidden
this
is
a
typical
offering
from
new
belgium
all
brews
are
good
just
not
impressive
they
kinda
all
taste
the
same
with
a
little
variation
to
each
style
d
not
too
bad
this
drinks
well
for
style
lower
alcohol
helps
but
so
does
tamed
sweetness
and
overall
balancing
of
flavors
there
is
no
issue
with
drinking
a
second
bottle
thanks
to
my
friend
jacob
for
sharing
this
right
off
the
bat
im
wondering
whats
up
with
all
the
banana
in
this
beer
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
nonyeasty
hefeweizen
weird
the
malt
is
very
smooth
and
pale
and
the
beer
on
a
whole
is
quite
drinkable
im
just
not
sure
whats
going
on
this
is
certainly
not
your
average
tripel
and
possibly
not
a
tripel
overall
pretty
good
drinkability
the
flavors
are
not
overpowering
nice
sweetness
with
some
fruity
and
nutty
characteristics
the
feel
is
a
bit
bubblier
than
i
prefer
but
still
a
good
beer
overall
d
hells
yes
oh
how
i
have
missed
this
beer
smooth
clear
flavorful
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
i
wish
i
could
get
it
regularly
perhaps
i
scored
it
a
little
higher
than
the
average
not
sure
i
have
been
trying
to
avoid
seeing
the
scores
until
after
i
review
but
this
is
a
beer
that
will
always
be
one
of
my
favorites
and
the
beer
that
got
me
into
belgians
between
this
and
abbey
from
nbb
you
cant
loose
drinks
pretty
easy
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
flavor
to
the
beer
but
its
not
too
bad
otherwise
overall
not
something
that
impressed
me
very
much
many
better
tripels
out
there
there
just
wasnt
a
lot
of
flavor
i
wont
buy
this
again
d
its
a
bit
too
much
flavor
for
me
at
the
moment
drinkability
im
not
really
a
tripel
guy
could
you
tell
this
seems
like
a
pretty
good
ale
though
i
do
feel
its
a
little
too
centered
around
the
alcohol
flavors
feels
kind
of
raw
gets
smoother
and
sweeter
as
the
session
progresses
sweet
and
fruity
and
high
abv
poured
into
a
schnifter
it
has
a
golden
color
and
a
light
head
with
no
lacing
for
a
readily
available
cheap
beer
that
has
a
high
abv
this
beer
is
great
not
anything
to
brag
about
but
worth
a
spot
in
the
fridge
good
session
beer
too
overall
it
wasnt
bad
for
a
new
belgiumnot
the
best
brewery
in
colorado
by
far
but
bad
for
trippels
in
general
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
good
drinkable
tripel
flavorful
easy
to
find
and
pleasant
to
the
last
drop
d
id
recommend
this
to
someone
if
they
were
looking
for
a
tripel
this
is
something
different
ive
never
had
a
trippel
like
this
not
bad
but
different
overall
this
is
pretty
good
still
havent
had
a
lot
experience
with
teh
trippel
style
so
maybe
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
dubbel
that
was
just
a
bit
stronger
not
quite
a
bit
stronger
but
at
any
rate
still
a
good
brew
i
just
couldnt
drink
bu
1
or
2
of
these
dthis
is
nearly
8
but
i
have
been
drinking
it
all
evening
d
very
drinkable
for
an
8
5
abv
ale
unfortunately
in
the
world
of
belgian
tripels
this
one
is
just
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
still
a
solid
and
worthy
choice
though
poured
in
a
tumbler
nice
caramel
color
with
a
red
tinge
head
was
moderately
frothy
about
a
two
fingers
with
some
lacing
kind
of
fruity
on
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
spice
not
as
full
and
rich
as
i
expect
a
triple
to
be
but
it
was
nice
and
malty
with
that
nice
belgian
yeast
initial
taste
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
after
taste
overall
its
ok
not
the
best
not
the
worst
they
do
in
fact
go
down
pretty
easy
given
its
price
about
8
a
6pack
and
availability
i
buy
this
one
pretty
often
it
is
only
a
step
below
the
best
belgian
tripels
and
id
recommend
it
highly
to
anyone
that
likes
the
style
so
drinkable
as
well
which
some
of
even
the
better
belgians
lack
due
to
the
overwhelming
flavors
this
one
excels
on
so
many
levels
bottle
from
the
davis
coop
pours
a
clear
orange
brown
darker
than
i
expect
for
the
style
lacing
disappears
quickly
smells
of
pureed
bananas
ethanol
fruity
malt
spicy
strong
flavor
fruity
ethanol
on
a
nice
malt
base
bananay
esters
and
other
yeasty
notes
actually
tastes
more
alcoholic
than
it
actually
is
medium
to
full
bodied
slightly
creamy
drinks
well
no
way
to
know
this
isnt
a
belgianbrewed
beer
thats
been
a
staple
on
the
continent
for
centuries
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
a
mere
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
barnyard
and
new
belgiums
signature
malted
garbage
smell
whereas
the
malted
garbage
is
in
the
background
of
the
aroma
it
dominates
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
im
running
out
of
new
ways
to
describe
my
distant
for
the
new
belgium
malt
character
i
should
probably
stop
trying
their
beers
because
i
have
yet
to
like
them
this
is
probably
my
favorite
yearround
new
belgium
beer
this
and
the
dubbel
are
their
bread
and
butter
in
my
opinion
d
decent
pretty
average
trippel
if
you
ask
me
the
way
it
covers
my
tongue
is
enjoyable
though
d
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
after
i
learn
more
about
the
style
and
have
tasted
more
example
unfortunely
for
now
not
a
favorite
from
nbb
easy
enough
to
drink
and
a
good
beginners
intro
to
the
style
dvery
it
even
gets
better
as
it
sits
in
the
glass
and
warms
a
tad
overall
a
good
addition
to
the
brewery
who
brought
us
fat
tire
feels
mediumbodied
not
cloying
at
all
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
liked
it
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
disappointing
bottle
would
not
revisit
based
on
the
vegetal
aftertaste
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
clear
golden
color
large
white
head
that
had
nice
retention
and
left
some
chunky
lacing
smell
is
wonderful
this
is
as
close
to
true
belgian
tripel
that
ive
across
this
side
of
the
pond
lots
of
pale
malt
light
fruits
light
funk
sugar
and
belgian
yeast
all
make
their
presence
known
in
the
nose
taste
is
full
of
candied
fruits
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
yeastiness
a
little
funk
that
was
around
in
the
nose
and
some
boozy
warmth
its
not
overly
complex
but
its
very
tasty
mouthfeeel
is
on
the
low
end
of
medium
and
there
is
hardly
any
carbonation
which
seems
to
be
the
only
thing
its
missing
belgian
style
tripels
should
be
effervescent
and
this
sadly
is
not
nevertheless
it
tastes
great
and
is
very
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
nice
work
mouthfeel
is
good
and
its
drinkable
but
really
only
has
me
wanting
a
more
substantial
example
of
this
style
with
no
disrespect
to
nb
i
wish
i
hadnt
sullied
the
westmalle
glass
very
disappointed
and
i
hate
to
report
it
this
is
a
2009
bottled
pours
nicely
golden
yellow
true
to
type
lacy
head
skims
the
top
carbonation
quite
high
higher
than
for
the
genre
lending
a
lighterbodied
mouthfeel
whats
so
disappointing
for
one
smell
none
except
a
hint
of
vegetal
not
fresh
cut
grass
or
flower
stems
but
perhaps
several
day
old
cut
carnation
stems
flavor
totally
lacks
any
yeastiness
and
doughiness
the
principal
reason
why
i
love
trippels
instead
theres
some
sort
of
vegetal
metallic
or
is
it
alkalinethe
word
itself
suggests
what
im
reaching
for
base
underpinning
this
strangely
bitter
lagerish
tasting
ale
the
greeny
parts
of
asparagus
or
artichokes
followed
by
what
amounts
to
in
my
recallthose
days
are
over
sour
mash
that
this
is
a
great
brewery
with
its
politics
naturally
and
concomitantly
bound
up
with
its
fabulous
products
and
facilities
makes
it
really
hard
to
censure
any
product
this
is
the
second
failure
ive
tasted
in
lincoln
perhaps
lincoln
stores
do
not
know
how
to
store
product
or
perhaps
the
runts
of
the
litter
end
up
here
given
that
most
tastebuds
here
lean
to
the
bud
and
miller
and
even
more
keystone
interpretations
of
beer
i
cant
quite
reason
through
this
glaring
failure
of
beermaking
light
honey
amber
with
some
visable
suspended
yeast
decent
rocky
white
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
decent
rings
of
lace
down
the
glass
smells
like
fruity
belgian
yeast
and
citrus
fruits
caramel
and
toasted
bread
with
a
hit
of
candy
sugar
and
sour
yeast
in
the
finish
medium
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
highly
drinkable
version
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
one
inch
of
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
sufficient
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
for
a
tripel
has
a
surprisingly
malty
aroma
the
lack
of
esters
from
the
yeast
differentiates
this
from
the
rest
of
the
sytle
the
taste
is
malt
driven
as
well
some
spice
comes
into
play
finishes
with
a
wisp
of
alcohol
also
has
a
lingering
sweetness
i
prefer
my
tripels
on
the
dry
side
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
bodied
a
tripel
that
is
easy
on
the
pocketbook
and
is
a
bargain
unfortunately
it
cannot
compete
with
the
better
imported
tripels
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
would
certainly
drink
over
and
over
again
even
if
it
tastes
like
an

this
one
could
get
me
in
trouble
it
is
one
of
the
eaisest
drinking
triples
i
have
ever
had
and
would
love
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
edit
as
it
warms
this
beer
takes
on
a
different
character

does

i
guess
this
is
normal
but
wow
big
difference
mouth
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
but
helps
support
the
bittering
hops
leaves
the
mouth
a
bit
dry
and
longing
for
another
sip
this
is
truly
a
superb
tripel

being

it

pretty

nice

not

overall
its
very
comparable
with
a

but
at
a
reasonable
cost
and
in
a
convenient

the
alcohol
content
coupled
with
the
good
flavor
is
nice
as
well
near
transparent
golden
with
a

creamy
head
that
retains
and
leaves
beautiful
lace
in

balance
between

malts
and
fruits
in
the
aroma
gives
me
an
impression
that
the
taste
will
be
balanced
as
well
and
indeed
it
is
roasty

finish
with

that

i

what
it
is

bothers

about

the

seems
to
be

like
this

the

in

would

did

around

kick
nice
brew
color
was
a
hazy
deep
yellow
almost
orangey
glow
with
a
great
frothy
head
that
was
an
inch
or
so
thick
and
lasted
pretty
much
through
the
whole
glass
smells
lightly
of
lemon
orange
peels
maybe
or
banana
peel
good
floral
hop
presence
with
a
spicey
note
like
pepper
or
clove
taste
was
good
with
a
good
solid
fruit
and
hop
mix
with
lots
of
floral
spicey
hops
that
fizz
around
in
the
mouth
lots
of
carbination
it
reminded
me
of
a
corona
with
a
lime
or
lemon
in
it
but
way
more
bolder
and
full
bodied
thats
maybe
a
bad
example
but
its
all
i
can
think
of
damn
good
and
drinkable
ahh
hows
this
it
was
like
paulaner
hefeweisen
with
a
lemon
wedge
i
think
thatll
do
this
beer
pours
a
somewhat
small
head
for
a
belgian
but
it
lasted
throughout
the
glass
nice
golden
color
i
poured
the
yeast
from
the
bottle
into
the
beer
for
maxium
flavor
and
aroma
taste
is
malt
then
fruit
and
spice
finishing
with
hops
the
smell
is
of
fruitty
esters
and
alcohol
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
a
belgian
style
beer
fine
orange
color
and
thick
head
display
well
in
a
chimay
chalice
nose
is
a
bit
understated
subtle
mix
of
coriander
and
belgian
yeast
mouthfeel
is
big
with
a
slightly
rough
edge
taste
is
great
compares
well
with
some
authentic
beligian
trippels
i
get
some
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
nothing
too
pronounced
a
sweet
light
malty
taste
does
linger
this
beer
like
most
other
belgianstyles
ive
tried
doesnt
lead
me
to
immediately
reach
for
another
its
complexity
makes
one
a
week
about
right
all
in
all
a
good
drinkable
beer
well
maybe
4
or
5
they
certainly
seem
strong
total
score
27
out
of
50
i
think
new
belgium
did
a
pretty
good
job
on
this
beer
i
could
have
sworn
by
the
aroma
that
this
beer
had
been
brewed
overseas
i
just
think
that
they
need
a
little
more
flavor
up
front
to
balance
out
the
strong
alcohol
and
bitter
finish
drinkability
in
spite
of
the
weird
taste
it
was
very
smooth
and
there
was
nothing
artificial
about
it
pours
a
very
deep
goldenorange
color
with
very
little
head
a
very
floral
aroma
with
fruits
and
spiced
hops
very
complex
a
crisp
clean
taste
which
is
refreshing
a
little
bit
of
spice
in
the
taste
mixed
with
alcohol
up
front
is
sweet
with
a
finish
that
is
sort
of
biting
from
the
hops
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
new
belgium
but
still
a
nice
brew
finish
is
long
and
appetizing
again
new
belgium
brewing
inc
is
a
hit
do
they
have
a
deal
with
the
devil
this
orangeishyellow
cloudy
brew
ha
ha
is
rather
good
a
lemony
citrus
malltiness
and
yeastyalcohol
smell
to
the
nose
the
head
is
pour
pun
not
a
typo
a
shred
of
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
taste
is
a
bitter
meets
sweet
flavor
and
a
definate
taste
of
lemon
reminds
me
of
a
bottle
conditioned
wheat
beer
in
flavor
and
nose
more
than
a
tripel
but
definately
meets
all
the
requirements
of
a
tripel
give
it
a
shot
you
can
definately
do
worse
pours
a
lovely
hazy
golden
color
with
a
foamy
and
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
nice
lace
nose
is
quite
fruity
with
notes
of
fresh
ripe
apple
banana
and
citrus
some
floral
hop
aromas
are
also
present
taste
up
front
is
sweet
candied
sugar
with
some
fruity
esters
and
tart
citrus
notes
to
follow
spicy
hops
kick
in
at
the
end
and
leave
a
dry
crisp
finish
a
very
fine
brew
this
is
probably
the
best
offering
from
new
belgium
brewing
co
poured
looking
like
fresh
apple
cider
but
with
a
fluffy
white
head
foam
was
sticky
and
hung
around
like
many
others
cant
some
candy
sugar
cideriness
detected
amidst
the
malt
slightly
more
bitterness
than
ive
come
to
expect
form
this
style
of
beer
made
it
a
refreshing
change
from
overly
malty
brews
the
new
belgium
boys
and
girls
did
a
good
job
with
the
tripel
style
imo
damn
impressive
beer
for
being
brewing
the
the
good

i
can
only
hope
to
produce
a
triple

from

thanks
to
a
great
trade
the
beers
in
actual
belgium
cant
be
much
better
than
this
can
they
poured
a
golden

thick

alternated
between
fruity
and
hoppy
cleverly
balanced

good

a

get
to
a

50
f
recommended
the
smell
is
wonderful
the
previous
bottles
i
had
seemed
a
lot
more
sweet
but
not
overly
so
this
one
has
a
little
more
hops
present
and
high
alcohol
is
present
on
the
tongue
most
of
the
way
through
the
glass
the
lasting
impressions
are
of
sweetness
and
alcohol
this
is
probably
my
favorite
new
belgium
product
thus
far
i
will
let
some
of
my
other

age
a

a
good

another

hazy

with
a
big
foamy

one
smells
the
bubblegum
like
sweetness
of
belgian
candi
sugar
citrus
spice
and
something
very
much
like
sourdough
bread
on
the
palate
this
beer
displays
a
very
pleasant
contrast
between
its
creamy
texture
and
the
spicy
flavors
of
clove
and
hops
with
a
somewhat
dry
peppery
finish
quite
delicious
one
of
the
best

certainly
one

the

of
the
combination

in
this

spicy

perhaps
with
a
bit
more
spice
more
spicy
fruit

the
taste
with
definite
alcohol

spiciness
is
in
command
of
this
brew
with
a
good
balance
of
bitterness
and
maltiness
in
the
background
lots
of
carbonation
makes
for
an
interesting
mouthfeel
great
malty
finish
which
is
a
big
factor
in
defining
a
great
beer
for
my
palate
the
large
amount
of
carbonation
makes
this
more
of
a
sipping
brew
quite
an
impressive
one
though
another
masterpiece
from
new
belgium
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
versions
of
a
tripel
i
have
tasted
a
bright
golden
color
leads
to
a
fruity
malt
aroma
one
taste
and
you
recognize
a
tasty
clean
crisp
fruity
beer
that
hides
its
alcohol
content
well
until
you
have
a
couple
more
just
a
great
refreshing
tasty
libation
peachygold
hue
with
subtle
highlights
of
bronze
the
white
head
was
fluffy
modest
in
size
it
reached
a
finger
in
height
very
good
retention
a
thick
foamy
cap
lasts
quite
awhile
i
let
the
yeast
find
their
way
into
my
glass
they
slowly
danced
their
way
to
the
bottom
it
is
a
beautiful
sight
that
needs
to
be
set
to
music
it
laced
it
thick
rings
awesome
the
nose
is
a
lovely
blend
of
sweet
candy
sugar
and
alcohol
in
the
background
notes
of
floral
hops
pearlike
fruitiness
and
marshmallows
the
nose
is
very
pleasant
fair
potency
i
have
a
young
bottle
of
beer
im
reviewing
eight
months
before
it
expires
and
thus
the
alcohol
sharpness
on
the
tongue
is
a
tad
too
strong
it
needs
to
mellow
that
is
my
only
beef
with
nbs
trippel
but
that
problem
can
be
remedied
with
cellaring
on
the
palate
the
candysugared
sweetness
marshmallows
and
bubblegum
blends
wonderfully
with
floral
hops
and
fruitiness
the
malt
is
noticeable
as
a
background
entity
which
is
very
well
done
the
yeast
provides
just
a
kiss
of
earthiness
the
alcohol
is
belly
warming
it
also
provides
spiciness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
which
is
quite
lovely
and
it
does
find
its
way
to
your
brain
medium
body
with
modest
natural
carbonation
that
is
very
fitting
for
this
beer
this
is
a
very
respectable
tripel
now
factor
in
the
cost
6
00
a
sixpack
and
you
have
a
bargain
that
cannot
be
ignored
when
i
need
a
belgianstyle
beer
nb
is
always
there
for
me
god
bless
them
this
is
an
absolutely
lovely
beer
recommended
this
is
another
fine
example
of
the
new
belgium
brewing
company
this
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
very
large
creamy
white
head
the
head
lasts
alot
longer
than
most
brews
from
this
company
which
is
a
good
thing
there
is
a
fruity
smell
to
the
beer
upon
first
taste
you
notice
light
malt
sweetness
with
alot
of
hop
and
fruit
flavors
also
there
is
a
slight
wheat
taste
the
beer
also
has
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
to
it
which
isnt
too
overwhealming
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
an
awardwinner
that
doesnt
live
up
to
its
tall
billing
quickly
dissipating
white
head
very
spicy
nose
slight
alcohol
hints
flavor
is
part
wheat
and
spicy
though
one
would
hope
for
greater
complexity
billowly
thick
creamy
persistant
white
head
golden
slightly
hazy
hue
that
seems
a
touch
darker
than
the
norm
for
a
tripel
the
large
amount
of
yeast
sediment
in
the
bottle
indicates
bottle
conditioning
complex
fruity
esters
include
clove
which
dominates
but
subtle
pear
and
banana
notes
can
be
discerned
as
well
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
tastes
a
bit
cleaner
than
other
tripels
but
is
still
complex
in
flavor
a
nectar
like
sweetness
upfront
is
ensued
by
fruity
yeast
byproducts
including
notes
of
pear
and
green
apple
acetaldehyde
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
rounds
it
out
in
the
finish
a
well
balanced
well
brewed
and
fresh
tripel
though
not
as
intense
as
some
belgian
tripels
if
you
can
find
them
fresh
gold
medal
gabf
2001
if
i
recall
correctly
i
was
not
as
impressed
as
my
fellow
beer
tasters
i
though
it
was
good
had
a
nice
citrus
flavor
but
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
for
the
price
this
is
a
damn
good
trippel
one
of
the
best
six
packs
for
under
8
its
only
slightly
below
the
level
of
the
good
belgian
trippels
o
for
me
the
alcohol
level
and
strong
harsh
finish
detract
but
otherwise
this
is
a
solid
tripel
poured
into
a
chalice
it
has
an
amber
color
with
little
head
it
has
some
notes
of
citrus
and
has
some
fruitiness
to
it
it
is
good
but
i
have
had
better
triples
a
bit
thin
and
sweet
for
the
style
but
hides
the
abv
dangerously
well
fruity
nose
fruit
malt
sweet
and
spicy
taste
beautiful
dark

very
nice
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
triples
but
a
good
quality
one
always
pleases
and
i
can
appreciate
the
artisanry
this
one
was
unimpressive
had
it
at
the
abbey
brewing
co
in
south
beach
miami
its
their
house
beer
but
they
dont
actually
brew
it
there
it
was
the
most
appealing
item
on
their
menu
but
i
wasnt
impressed
enjoyed
the
beverage

a
nicely
enjoyable

overall
good
example
of
style
different
tastes
at
each
part
of
sip
make
it
interesting
best
if
sipped
slowly
no
overpowering
booze
despite
being
10
the
taste
tends
to
make
one
forget
the
aroma
yeah
there
are
biscuit
malts
sugar
sweetness
and
clean
crisp
hops
but
there
is
this
odd
aftertaste
that
i
would
only
best
describe
as
medicinal
i
have
to
say
that
it
really
throws
the
positives
out
the
door
because
the
taste
is
what
lingers
it
really
throws
all
the
good
character
stuff
i
have
to
say
the
color
on
this
brew
is
hay
color
lightly
yellowish
with
a
big
fluffy
head
a
very
nice
looking
beer
smells
of
fruit
subdued
hops
come
through
faintly
on
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
estery
with
a
chewy
medium
thickness
in
the
mouthfeel
sugars
come
through
very
prevalently
and
hide
the
high
abv
so
tread
caustiously
on
this
one
i
thought
this
beer
was
well
crafted
thought
im
not
a
huge
fan
on
the
style
the
look
nose
and
mouthfeel
alone
on
this
made
it
ok
to
drink
a
tasty
well
done
triple
on
the
palate
nothing
about
it
really
stood
out
for
me
but
it
wasnt
lacking
either
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
more
prominent
long
lasting
foamy
head
not
really
the
best
at
reviewing
beers
yet
but
am
i
the
only
one
who
got
a
somewhat
metallic
taste
from
this
maybe
my
palate
is
messed
up
but
i
could
swear
i
had
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
its
not
bad
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
overpowering
but
i
really
dont
have
much
experience
tasting
belgian
beers
i
wouldnt
jump
to
taste
this
again
but
im
just
trying
to
expand
my
horizons
and
im
definitely
gonna
work
on
better
reviews
cheers
overall
below
average
i
would
not
try
this
and
i
will
not
be
buying
it
again
very
close
to
being
a
drain
pour
and
ive
never
drain
poured
a
beer
before
however
i
do
have
a
beer
that
promises
to
be
awful
so
i
might
just
do
that
tonight
bottom
line
representative
of
the
style
without
innovating
on
the
lighter
side
with
hints
of
apple
worth
the
price
from
my
tasting
notes
the
brother
davids
triple
poured
darker
than
most
triples
with
more
of
an
amber
color
than
the
typical
golden
color
it
had
a
good
fruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
that
yielded
a
sweet
and
fruity
flavor
with
plenty
of
the
belgian
yeast
notes
of
candy
sugars
and
cloves
there
was
little
to
no
perceptible
bitterness
to
this
incredibly
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
triple
it
had
a
high
abv
which
was
well
hidden
and
made
it
presence
known
as
i
drank
this
tasty
triple
too
quickly
omy
overall
impression
for
this
beer
is
that
its
a
quite
decent
interpretation
of
an
abbey
style
ale
made
in
america
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
this
and
will
recommned
this
beer
to
any
of
my
friends
who
particularly
enjoy
abbey
style
ales
probably
my
least
favorite
from
anderson
valley
a
little
disappointed
good
tripel
nice
slow
sipping
beer
well
worth
a
try
o
unfortunately
not
all
that
impressed
with
this
brew
it
has
the
potential
to
be
a
solid
offering
but
between
the
plastic
flavour
sneaking
in
and
the
alcohol
presence
not
integrated
so
elegantly
it
just
doesnt
make
a
name
for
itself
not
a
try
if
its
in
front
of
you
but
not
worth
seeking
out
overall
i
would
take
a
less
alcoholic
version
of
this
that
had
a
more
rounded
malt
profile
and
a
bit
more
hop
presence
maybe
i
am
prejudice
but
if
its
gonna
be
this
strong
it
needs
to
be
a
bit
more
balanced
maybe
even
a
touch
darker
maybe
its
a
triple
that
drinks
like
a
quad
all
i
know
is
i
probably
wouldnt
get
another
some
dark
fruits
that
lead
to
a
sweet
and
full
taste
this
was
part
of
a
mix
six
i
made
and
has
since
become
an
old
favorite
o
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
this
isnt
going
to
change
my
mind
the
taste
is
strong
and
delivers
a
powerful
alcohol
warmth
many
of
the
flavors
dont
come
out
strongly
hearty
malt
touches
of
prune
or
plum
theres
a
bit
of
alcohol
brashness
at
the
end
i
get
raisin
in
the
body
of
the
taste
but
it
is
fleeting
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
id
like
the
fruit
to
take
the
forefront
a
little
more
tripels
are
one
of
those
styles
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
i
ususally
find
them
to
be
too
sweet
and
taxing
to
easily
finish
and
will
rarely
want
a
second
after
ive
had
the
first
while
brother
davids
triple
is
flavorful
and
drinkable
it
is
still
a
tripel
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
id
give
it
a
try
the
sweetness
was
too
much
for
me
other
than
that
its
fine
with
its
high
alcohol
content
this
one
is
a
sipper
and
we
usually
find
ourselves
maxxed
at
2
a
really
nice
belgian
style
ale
good
flavor
hides
its
strength
well
and
has
a
unique
profile
liked
this
one
a
lot
and
would
seek
it
out
again
brown
reddish
color
a
little
cloudy
smells
licorice
and
alcohol
alcohol
is
also
noticeable
in
its
taste
hard
to
hide
10
anyway
tastes
strong
notes
of
caramel
apricot
cloves
and
licorice
with
some
spicy
twist
body
is
liquor
like
tasted
better
once
i
let
it
warm
up
though
hard
to
beat
the
main
belgians
in
their
tradition
overall
a
fairly
good
triple
but
as
others
stated
not
going
to
win
over
any
abbey
lovers
i
would
recommend
you
definitely
give
it
a
shot
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
anderson
valley
overall
a
different
take
on
a
tripel
by
anderson
valley
although
i
appreciated
the
fruit
flavours
taking
precedence
i
would
have
liked
to
pick
up
on
more
hops
better
options
out
there
for
tripels
but
worthy
of
a
try
overall
a
solid
but
not
over
whelming
addition
to
the
style
if
new
to
the
style
its
a
solid
intro
beer
i
find
it
a
bit
heavier
than
others
within
the
style
darker
in
color
than
most
as
well
overall
not
what
i
expected
and
not
going
to
win
over
any
hardcore
belgian
fans
but
i
actually
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
5
for
drinking
like
4
i
was
excited
to
try
this
offering
from
anderson
valley
brewing
company
i
really
enjoy
a
good
triple
and
since
it
is
from
a
semilocal
brewing
company
i
wanted
to
give
it
a
try
it
smelled
fantastic
when
i
opened
the
bottle
and
had
a
really
nice
color
when
i
poured
it
into
the
glass
there
was
very
little
head
and
it
did
not
last
long
the
flavor
did
not
match
the
smell
it
had
kind
of
a
sour
milk
taste
to
it
that
lingered
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
that
made
me
crave
for
something
sweet
the
10abv
was
well
masked
by
the
aftertaste
definitely
not
one
of
their
better
offerings
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruit
spices
and
alcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
and
a
distinct
hair
spray
flavor
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
all
around
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
worth
revisiting
in
my
opinion
overall
this
was
an
ok
example
of
the
style
in
fact
kind
of
staggering
since
most
triples
i
had
are
89
so
not
a
bad
high
octane
version
at
all
its
a
hard
sell
with
la
fin
du
monde
in
a
bigger
bottle
for
far
less
money
on
the
same
shelf
i
wouldnt
go
hunting
for
this
one
but
dont
turn
it
down
if
poured
for
you
o
the
aroma
and
flavor
dont
really
stand
out
to
me
its
not
a
bad
tripel
just
not
great
the
10
abv
is
impressive
though
overall
a
very
unique
tasting
brew
one
that
has
a
mix
of
a
belgian
tripel
and
a
sour
beer
blended
extremely
well
giving
this
brew
a
superb
drinkability
and
flavor
orange
sweet
sugar
vague
spices
and
a
good
dosage
of
alcohol
providing
a
heat
and
some
balance
to
the
beer
its
enough
and
with
more
sips
the
beers
flavor
improves
the
body
is
nearly
full
somewhat
syrupy
in
texture
with
low
carbonation
in
the
body
somewhat
of
a
surprise
for
me
it
took
me
until
now
to
venture
into
the
avs
brother
david
line
and
the
tripel
has
rewarded
me
now
to
try
the
dubbel
like
all
tripels
to
me
at
least
i
get
a
disjointed
booziness
which
here
is
quite
minimized
but
still
present
in
the
midst
of
an
underappreciated
fruity
wheattinged
sugarpop
mediated
slightly
by
the
oldworld
yeast
validation
seeing
how
the
whole
bottle
disappeared
in
our
short
time
together
the
drinkability
is
surely
bahl
hornin
to
crib
some
marketing
from
another
av
product
overall
disappointed
frankly
liked
the
dubbel
better
not
bad
by
any
means
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
full
bodied
and
low
carbonation
make
this
a
very
strange
triple
i
dont
think
this
one
is
jiving
with
me
it
tastes
alright
but
the
expectations
were
not
met
overall
decent
if
anything
its
a
bit
mild
overall
a
bit
less
bite
from
the
spice
and
more
bold
and
complex
malt
flavor
would
be
nice
second
tasting
seems
drier
this
is
my
favorite
anderson
valley
beer
a
decent
offering
from
a
brewery
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
an
interesting
and
slightly
different
sort
of
tripel
o
tripels
are
a
personal
favorite
style
of
mine
and
when
i
saw
this
affordable
4pack
i
had
to
pick
it
up
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
will
be
able
to
get
through
the
4pack
no
problem
but
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
it
lacks
some
of
the
complexity
of
the
best
tripels
is
a
little
sweeter
than
i
like
and
the
finish
of
the
beer
seems
a
little
sloppy
i
will
spend
the
extra
buck
on
a
4pack
of
la
fin
du
monde
if
i
want
a
great
tripel
for
a
great
price
o
this
has
potential
with
nice
aromatics
up
front
when
drinking
it
but
theres
something
going
on
that
doesnt
tie
it
all
together
the
finish
is
not
pleasant
and
i
ended
up
dumping
most
of
the
bottle
o
had
with
pizza
very
easy
drinking
and
surprisingly
tasty
it
grows
on
me
a
poor
tripel
i
think
most
american
versions
are
but
a
good
beer
overall
i
suppose
you
could
do
worse
but
i
am
not
really
feeling
this
one
at
all
compared
to
other
triples
ive
had

o
overall
this
is
a
very
dissappointing
beer
i
had
bought
this
before
i
would
check
reviews
and
upon
seeing
how
bad
it
was
i
figured
i
would
wait
around
for
it
with
room
running
out
in
the
cellar
figured
id
get
rid
of
this
just
bleh
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
would
definitely
pick
it
up
again
but
it
definitely
isnt
your
normal
triple
o
an
alright
tripel
though
nothing
special
its
a
little
on
the
bland
side
and
is
too
boozy
for
my
tastes
overall
pretty
good
not
great
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
but
id
definitely
drink
it
if
it
were
offered
pours
a
darker
color
than
many
tripels
ive
had
rust
colored
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
quite
robust
floral
malty
flavor
is
interesting
again
for
a
tripel
prominent
belgian
yeast
flavor
and
feel
sugary
malts
pears
grassy
hops
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
nice
exploding
carbonation
on
the
tongue
medium
body
easy
drinking
no
trace
of
the
10
abv
here
even
as
it
warms
up
this
is
a
cool
tripel
because
its
a
little
heavier
than
most
it
stood
up
well
to
a
jalapenopepperoni
pizza
which
many
beers
of
this
style
could
not
do
not
my
favorite
but
a
good
effort
o
meh
the
metal
threw
me
off
but
its
decent
has
a
good
burn
on
the
back
end
i
think
it
was
6
for
a
22
oz
probably
wont
buy
again
as
far
as
tripels
brewed
here
in
the
us
goes
this
is
pretty
good
and
id
have
no
problem
enjoying
in
the
future
i
have
a
second
bottle
and
i
will
leave
it
alone
for
a
year
or
so
to
see
if
anything
improves
it
was
reasonably
priced
at
5
or
6
bucks
for
a
22
ounce
bomber
but
i
would
hesitate
to
pay
even
that
if
it
doesnt
improve
with
age
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
to
a
friend
i
cellared
one
of
the
four
bottles
that
came
in
the
four
pack
i
plan
to
drink
it
a
year
from
now
the
rest
of
the
four
pack
wont
make
it
that
long
decent
triple
although
i
think
id
prefer
it
if
it
was
a
couple
points
less
in
strength
but
ill
support
any
brewery
that
uses
renewable
energy
sources
as
the
cap
says
solar
powered
if
you
couldnt
tell
from
the
description
i
didnt
like
this
beer
the
aroma
started
out
well
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
just
brings
this
beer
down
too
much
for
me
to
give
it
a
good
review
i
couldnt
get
over
the
lack
of
complexity
and
the
candy
flavor
just
pounded
my
taste
buds
beyond
recognition
the
thickness
just
made
me
sick
after
a
while
reminding
me
of
cough
syrup
a
tripel
should
be
light
and
complex
this
was
anything
but
this
one
is
on
the
hot
side
lots
of
nice
stone
fruit
along
with
a
descent
yeast
strain
but
the
alcohol
tends
to
get
in
the
way
of
everything
still
i
cant
help
but
think
this
brew
would
be
better
if
1
or
2
of
the
abv
was
sacrificed
so
less
sugar
had
to
be
added
in
the
proces
for
the
purpose
of
booze
o
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
one
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
color
little
foam
and
lace
aroma
is
full
of
estery
belgian
yeast
fruity
and
sweet
smelling
in
the
taste
sweet
fruity
yeast
belgian
candi
sugar
solid
malt
backbone
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
and
little
hop
bitterness
alcohol
has
a
moderate
presence
throughout
and
the
beer
is
warming
medium
bodied
feel
well
carbonated
and
finishes
pretty
clean
overall
a
nice
belgian
style
ale
o
comparable
to
belgium
triples
it
is
middle
of
the
road
but
for
an
american
triple
its
pretty
dang
good
balanced
and
hides
the
alc
pretty
well
in
a
dangerous
way
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
multiple
of
because
of
the
abv
and
the
heaviness
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
with
a
sharp
carbonation
and
light
body
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
a
wow
beer
i
find
myself
sipping
of
it
taking
my
time
and
happy
but
find
it
equally
enjoyable
and
forgettable
at
the
same
time
dr
its
difficult
to
drink
on
account
of
its
badly
handled
sugar
problem
and
its
overdone
thickness
the
price
isnt
particularly
great
considering
the
low
quality
a
trainwreck
attempt
at
the
tripel
style
overall
not
a
bad
brew
only
wish
that
great
initial
flavor
would
have
stuck
around
until
the
last
drop
oh
well
many
others
out
there
yet
to
try
o
this
is
a
lot
sweeter
hoppier
and
boozy
than
the
other
top
notch
tripels
ive
had
this
clearly
seems
like
an
americanized
version
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
overall
a
solid
tripel
by
no
means
a
standout
but
drinkable
and
enjoyable
smooth
easy
flavor
with
light
warming
and
bite
upon
swallowing
its
not
entirely
complex
but
very
pleasant
its
certainly
enjoyable
and
good
to
look
out
for
despite
the
fact
that
i
do
think
its
not
entirely
like
a
tripel
should
be
d
very
complex
lots
of
malt
and
yeast
character
my
first
anderson
valley
brew
and
i
am
impressed
a
nice
flavorful
triple
that
i
sure
will
revisit
overall
not
a
particularly
good
tripel
but
could
be
a
decent
intro
to
the
style
keeping
in
mind
that
there
are
far
better
examples
overall
this
is
good
fare
though
nothing
to
necessarily
crow
about
largely
because
the
vodkalike
kick
lessens
the
latter
half
of
the
mouthful
still
for
a
10
beer
its
certainly
palatable
and
the
malt
flavors
are
pronounced
and
wellbalanced
overall
brother
davids
got
solar
energy
and
a
sweet
stache
for
the
price
just
skip
it
d
very
little
alcohol
taste
comes
through
despite
this
being
10
im
impressed
by
how
smooth
this
is
i
wouldnt
drink
a
whole
4
pack
of
these
unless
everyone
else
around
me
was
going
to
do
the
same
though
solid
beer
overall
nice
ill
get
it
again
renews
my
faith
in
anderson
after
a
couple
disappointments
all
right
but
not
an
outstanding
tripel
though
maltier
than
most
for
what
its
worth
final
thought
not
bad
10
abv
and
only
3
a
bottle
i
could
love
me
some
of
this
beer
a
few
times
a
month
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
the
taste
is
excellent
mild
sweet
flavors
play
off
of
the
straw
and
funk
tastes
really
an
excellent
blend
very
well
balanced
beer
glad
to
have
tried
it
hope
to
drink
it
again
overall
flavor
profile
isnt
all
that
complex
additionally
the
flavor
that
dominates
is
a
bit
alcoholic
and
sweet
still
not
a
bad
beer
to
purchase
overall
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
came
across
more
beers
from
this
brewer
as
i
like
most
of
what
they
make
this
is
a
goto
beer
for
me
because
i
can
get
it
at
bevmo
and
the
local
corner
store
overall
very
interesting
brew
not
super
interesting
in
the
taste
but
near
to
it
nice
tasting
too
jd
the
smell
had
some
apple
tones
and
some
spices
taste
is
with
a
sweetness
caramelized
malts
and
some
apple
flavor
medium
bodied
and
like
by
the
group
of
guys
that
tried
it
pours
as
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
a
little
bit
of
amber
in
there
too
the
head
is
decent
at
first
but
fades
within
a
few
minutes
it
leave
just
a
very
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aromas
of
belgian
yeast
and
some
spice
rise
from
the
glass
the
taste
of
those
same
aromas
follow
through
fairly
well
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
than
expected
its
nice
actually
a
pretty
good
brew
all
around
the
smell
has
banana
alcohol
some
spices
upon
sipping
this
brew
i
am
getting
sweetness
malts
booze
some
apple
its
medium
bodied
an
acidic
feel
to
it
overall
a
very
average
tripel
not
as
good
as
the
dubbel
from
these
guys
o
have
i
mentioned
that
its
sweet
packs
a
punch
however
still
have
a
few
oz
s
to
go
and
my
head
is
reelingcould
be
the
empty
stomach
i
really
like
the
beers
from
avbc
but
this
one
is
a
little
sweet
for
me
a
good
but
not
great
tripel
there
is
lots
of
potential
here
ok
this
is
a
abbey
style
ale
that
changed
my
idea
of
what
i
thought
abbey
ale
was
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
like
a
dubbelmaybe
a
bit
darker
this
smells
like
nothing
ive
smelled
before
the
only
thing
id
compare
it
to
is
apples
with
a
strong
touch
alcohol
and
cloves
taste
is
definitley
cloves
and
applesapricots
you
may
want
to
let
it
settle
for
a
few
minutes
its
not
badbut
not
something
ive
acquired
a
taste
for
yet
it
might
take
me
a
few
more
bottles
to
get
used
it
you
should
try
it
for
yourself
you
might
like
it
because
this
brewery
makes
some
good
tasting
brew
given
the
abvs
this
beer
need
to
warm
up
and
swish
around
in
your
glass
a
little
and
it
really
develops
abv
brother
davids
are
underrated
on
this
site
they
are
making
this
abbey
style
their
own
slowly
but
surely
hope
they
keep
at
it
o
a
bit
underwhelming
especially
compared
to
some
other
brews
i
have
had
from
avbc
not
terrible
though
just
nothing
special
a
later
tasting
is
much
more
boozy
this
bottle
may
have
beenn
freshertoo
fresh
this
is
a
brew
that
should
set
up
for
a
year
or
more
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
too
outstanding
either
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
but
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
best
triples
worth
a
try
but
not
among
my
favorites
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
pours
a
bright
hazy
orangecopper
coloring
with
a
thin
half
inch
layer
of
tightly
bubbled
dense
head
aromas
of
nutmeg
coriander
and
boozey
sweet
characteristics
the
flavors
are
well
blended
and
crisp
and
you
get
a
mouthful
of
spices
at
the
end
of
the
beer
other
flavors
include
a
slightly
sour
malt
characteristic
booze
and
hints
of
citrus
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
for
the
style
imho
this
beer
has
a
midbodied
lacing
it
leaves
on
the
glass
but
the
beer
is
slick
so
it
settles
back
into
the
beer
after
a
bit
aftertaste
is
mostly
the
spices
with
a
slight
touch
of
the
sourness
right
at
the
end
the
finish
is
a
bit
rich
and
that
definitely
maintains
this
beer
as
a
sipper
as
a
tripel
or
any
beer
at
this
abv
is
meant
to
be
o
not
bad
but
not
great
either
one
seeking
a
tripel
could
do
much
better
got
this
bottle
off
my
brotherinlaw
in
a
trade
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
hazy
honey
golden
mainly
fruity
aroma
has
a
nice
tone
of
honey
sweetness
to
it
flavor
is
fruity
mainly
apple
and
banana
and
fairly
malty
as
well
and
overall
very
pleasing
texture
is
decently
fizzy
so
it
leaves
a
nice
tingle
looks
more
like
an
ipa
on
the
pour
an
opaque
amber
barely
any
head
nose
is
all
dried
banana
gingersnap
candied
raisin
hits
my
palate
with
a
big
scoop
of
warm
melon
powdered
sugar
quickly
followed
by
a
sharp
twist
of
hop
citrus
with
some
peppery
notes
tickling
the
edges
alcohol
warms
the
belly
vaguely
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
not
bad
but
not
great
this
beer
was
rescued
from
a
whole
foods
its
a
solid
b
effort
for
an
american
tripel
its
just
short
of
something
special
because
the
alcohols
are
a
little
out
of
balance
with
the
hops
lack
of
hops
dried
fruits
but
not
one
that
begs
you
to
drink
more

with

very
noticable
alcohol
d
good
beer
but
not
100
to
style
this
is
a
pretty
good
triple
i
would
expect
it
to
be
a
bit
more
effervescent
but
overall
an
enjoyable
bier
probably
best
with
a
red
meat
the
thick
maltiness
of
it
makes
me
think
roast
like
a
king
d
a
bit
too
flat
for
not
being
a
cask
brew
the
booziness
at
10abv
isnt
offset
with
enough
character
in
the
beer
to
keep
me
interested
started
out
intriguing
but
im
quickly
losing
interest
drinkability
highly
smelly
and
tasty
the
drinking
experience
is
grand
drinkability
is
exceptional
considering
its
cocktaillike
strength
i
will
absolutely
be
buying
this
again
notes
a
solid
tripel
but
it
does
not
capture
my
imagination
or
inspire
very
much
there
are
better
options
out
there
but
i
will
say
that
it
is
affordable
about
3
60
per
tulip
glass
d
well
for
a
10
triple
this
does
hide
the
alcohol
better
than
expected
it
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
overall
it
drinks
decently
salud
a
new
one
to
the
tx
scene
as
far
as
i
know
pours
clear
luminous
gold
and
as
headless
as
the
horseman
who
regains
popularity
about
every
time
this
year
smells
of
apricots
peaches
brown
sugar
and
bananas
taste
is
banana
phenols
up
front
then
a
rich
caramel
finish
not
complex
but
what
it
does
it
does
well
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
more
carbonated
than
it
looks
drinkability
is
good
its
a
wellbalanced
brew
and
the
alcohol
just
shows
up
as
a
warmth
later
both
signs
of
one
ill
easily
finish
david
you
can
be
my
brother
any
time
overall
not
worth
9
a
bomber
drinkability
there
is
no
mistake
that
this
is
an
american
version
on
a
belgian
triple
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
smooth
with
a
fine
warming
from
the
10abv
again
this
brew
is
a
valiant
effort
but
cant
quite
stand
up
to
its
belgian
counterparts
taste
is
only
a
hint
of
what
the
aroma
offered
its
sticky
and
overly
cloying
some
metallic
twang
and
a
crisp
fruitiness
of
apple
or
pear
this
is
just
too
slow
of
a
sipper
and
not
a
good
use
of
my
sobriety
its
a
big
beer
without
the
drinkability
of
a
big
beer
lots
of
typical
chimaylike
belgian
esters
some
maltiness
hiding
behind
the
esters
very
slight
hops
bitterness
i
did
not
get
the
fruit
profile
that
other
reviewers
got
from
this
beer
not
sure
why
but
it
aint
there
surprisingly
since
i
really
love
this
brewerys
other
offerings
but
id
pass
on
this
one
soft
and
sweet
is
the
balance
of
this
brew
nice
yet
soft
peppery
spicy
yeastiness
provides
an
accompanying
flavor
but
never
steals
the
show
soft
fruity
and
pleasant
this
could
be
described
nicely
as
a
soft
triple
or
rudely
as
a
weaktasting
triple
either
way
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
grainy
flavor
with
a
bunch
of
alcohol
and
fruity
notes
pineapple
muscadine
grapes
and
pears
its
more
than
slightly
sweet
with
a
sugary
finish
has
a
somewhat
creamy
feel
to
it
i
enjoyed
this
beer
especially
the
aroma
a
whole
bomber
to
myself
might
be
a
but
much
but
i
think
it
is
a
decent
american
tripel
i
would
not
be
opposed
to
buying
another
one
sometime
down
the
road
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
thick
dense
head
that
left
some
good
lacing
on
the
glass
head
died
down
rather
quickly
there
are
sweet
malt
and
bready
yeast
aromas
with
citrus
clove
and
spice
aromas
way
in
background
not
as
aromatic
as
some
tripels
had
to
spin
the
glass
a
little
to
get
to
some
of
the
aromas
to
come
out
this
tripel
seems
more
malty
than
others
i
have
had
and
there
is
a
nice
bready
yeast
flavor
up
front
then
the
alcohol
warmth
and
flavors
set
in
with
the
fruit
and
clove
flavors
the
beer
did
finish
kind
of
quick
there
are
some
lingering
faint
clove
and
alcohol
flavors
but
i
was
hoping
for
maybe
a
little
bit
more
it
still
has
a
very
good
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
about
the
right
carbonation
for
a
tripel
its
an
above
average
beer
there
are
so
many
great
tripels
out
there
that
it
is
hard
to
stack
this
one
up
against
them
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
as
it
is
tasty
but
i
might
reach
for
something
else
if
it
was
available
d
as
with
most
tripels
quite
drinkable
despite
abv
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
again
just
arrived
in
dallas
i
gave
this
beer
a
very
vigorous
pour
but
only
got
a
very
airy
very
slight
head
that
immediately
faded
away
the
color
is
dark
brandy
mostly
clear
the
nose
is
yeastyfruity
not
unpleasant
with
a
faint
faint
spiciness
it
has
a
fairly
sweet
flavor
backed
with
a
honeyish
fruitiness
the
phenols
are
more
prominent
here
giving
a
bandaid
type
character
but
it
blends
together
poorly
overall
a
rather
weak
effort
from
from
this
brewery
one
finger
off
white
head
doesnt
last
in
the
time
i
rough
pour
it
to
sitting
down
semitransparent
light
amber
body
with
a
ring
of
foam
bordering
the
brew
is
all
that
is
left
of
a
head
nose
resembles
honey
and
spices
taste
is
sweet
up
front
but
not
too
much
bitter
on
the
finish
with
some
heat
and
ethanol
fuming
off
your
tongue
some
honey
flavors
here
too
mead
like
then
the
carbonation
flattens
out
the
flavor
in
the
back
good
carbonation
and
balance
on
the
tongue
though
id
prefer
the
alcohol
being
hidden
better
its
just
too
noticed
not
a
horrible
triple
by
any
means
id
buy
this
again
drinkability
is
good
not
sure
why
this
beer
doesnt
get
better
rankings
i
think
its
a
pretty
solid
triple
that
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
a
high
abv
beer
this
is
a
really
smooth
triple
ale
it
is
a
really
clear
dark
amber
color
the
thing
that
strikes
me
most
is
how
smooth
it
is
not
hoppy
but
you
can
taste
the
hops
not
very
malty
but
you
can
taste
the
malt
it
is
a
very
well
crafted
and
balanced
brew
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
as
it
is
lightly
carbonated
the
main
thing
is
that
is
its
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
really
well
any
time
the
ten
percent
is
hidden
very
well
a
very
nice
triple
drinkability
overall
a
decent
tripel
but
there
are
better
out
there
poured
into
a
snifterlike
glass
clear
amber
with
lots
of
champagne
sized
bubbles
a
small
head
that
quickly
disappears
into
a
ring
of
not
quite
lace
aroma
of
berries
with
some
graininess
starts
out
sweet
with
a
bit
of
cloves
somewhat
unpleasant
alcohol
middle
mouthfeel
is
medium
tilted
toward
light
slightly
saccharine
finish
and
aftertaste
it
did
have
a
nice
label
though
not
too
memorable
this
rating
is
taken
from
my
notes
and
i
dont
really
remember
it
much
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
significant
room
for
improvement
there
was
decent
balance
but
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
and
not
quite
enough
flavor
overall
worth
a
try
d
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
high
alcohol
but
a
pretty
solid
triple
it
isnt
anything
mind
blowing
but
a
tasty
beer
that
is
worth
a
shot
recommended
mouthfeel
nicely
carbonated
the
sweetness
hits
you
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
the
carbonation
hits
you
in
the
back
of
the
throat
stand
without
the
accompaniment
of
food
overall
not
that
great
buy
a
real
triple
elsewhere
not
bad
too
sweet
ive
not
been
impressed
with
either
of
the
brother
david
brews
ive
tried
the
beer
is
good
not
great
to
sweet
and
too
much
alcohol
for
me
in
the
tastes
not
a
bad
brew
to
has
every
once
in
a
while
but
there
are
much
better
takes
on
the
style
seems
to
want
some
artisan
bread
butter
and
maybe
some
mild
soft
cheese
to
pair
with
it
minute
head
islands
of
very
large
bubbles
pool
together
here
and
there
same
basic
story
for
the
lacing
metallic
zinc
orange
in
color
youd
expect
it
to
glint
in
the
sun
barely
moves
to
a
lighter
yellowtinged
color
around
the
rims
molten
caramel
clove
spice
candied
oranges
banana
as
well
as
prune
plum
date
and
apricot
fruit
scents
as
well
theres
a
component
of
wet
iron
metallic
sweat
and
the
dirt
floor
of
a
cold
damp
unfinished
basement
mediumbodied
is
not
quite
in
control
of
its
sweetness
hence
you
get
a
scattershot
of
floral
dew
tangerine
orange
grapefruit
citrus
caramel
and
toffee
apple
pie
and
cobbler
styled
peach
pear
apricot
fruit
and
that
banana
custard
too
yeasty
too
clings
to
the
mouth
pores
carbonation
is
weak
the
clove
and
nutmeg
spice
more
muted
and
less
effectual
only
a
trace
of
grassiness
the
sweetness
does
release
an
inch
as
it
ends
so
its
more
perfume
and
the
tongue
can
move
freely
once
more
maybe
it
could
serve
as
a
literal
dessert
beer
a
nice
beer
one
of
the
better
american
tripels
nice
spiciness
from
the
yeast
very
nice
malt
profile
although
the
color
is
a
little
off
for
the
style
pretty
sweet
but
a
nice
dryness
at
the
end
much
better
than
golden
monkey
d
drinkable
but
just
barely
way
too
sweet
for
more
than
just
a
few
sips
drinkability
decent
beer
one
bomber
is
enough
for
me
but
this
beer
is
worth
a
look
overall
there
is
a
dryness
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
spicy
the
beer
showed
no
carbonation
but
there
was
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
feel
there
was
no
head
for
a
triple
there
needs
to
be
nice
head
i
feel
the
beer
lack
balance
it
was
blended
together
if
the
beer
took
some
time
in
the
cellar
and
aged
for
a
couple
of
years
i
think
it
would
be
a
whole
lot
better
pours
golden
slight
haze
thin
head
that
doesnt
last
nose
reminds
me
of
a
mead
that
i
had
recently
honeyed
with
some
lighter
fruits
in
the
mix
palate
is
sugary
sweet
pears
peaches
apricot
and
noticeable
alcohol
on
the
finish
seems
to
be
a
cross
between
a
golden
ale
and
a
tripel
to
me
dalcohol
really
shines
though
in
all
its
glory
low
repeatability
my
bottle
didnt
come
with
the
fancy
wax
so
that
may
have
been
my
first
clue
for
a
tripel
there
is
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
hopefully
the
bottle
was
not
roached
but
i
trudge
forward
appearance
is
a
caramal
with
sediment
flowing
freely
throught
the
bottle
and
glass
the
alcohol
is
there
but
is
very
nicely
masked
which
could
get
daddy
in
trouble
as
it
warms
the
complex
nature
of
the
beer
springs
forward
a
mild
sort
of
unpleasant
aftertaste
is
present
after
each
sip
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
anderson
valley
and
this
did
little
to
sway
into
buying
more
of
their
beers
not
bad
a
tad
too
boozy
id
like
to
try
this
one
after
a
bit
of
aging
pours
clear
yellowish
but
a
bit
darker
good
doughey
head
taste
is
totally
off
this
does
not
strike
me
as
a
true
tripel
lots
of
vinous
flavor
here
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
quadrupel
despite
the
coloring
some
dark
fruits
this
beer
is
a
contradiction
im
also
feeling
some
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
more
of
a
clusterfuck
pardon
my
language
than
anything
its
not
all
bad
but
not
what
i
expected
when
i
was
looking
for
a
good
tripel
taste
at
your
own
risk
this
is
missing
something
clear
amber
pour
no
matter
how
hard
i
tried
i
could
not
coax
a
head
out
of
this
beer
aroma
is
spicy
and
malty
but
weak
taste
was
musty
yeast
spice
and
lots
of
alcohol
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
sticky
finish
good
but
there
are
much
better
tripels
out
there
interesting
but
not
a
standout
brew
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
massive
head
nose
has
some
spiciness
on
top
of
sweet
malts
and
light
hops
the
spiciness
provides
a
nice
touch
to
the
taste
the
beer
was
very
heavy
on
the
alcohol
taste
it
is
not
covered
well
at
all
it
really
just
kicks
you
in
the
teeth
the
alcohol
brings
down
the
drinkability
and
its
just
not
enjoyable
to
drink
the
only
beer
from
anderson
valley
i
was
not
impressed
with
initial
taste
is
crisp
and
a
bit
carbonated
very
malty
and
the
taste
lingers
a
bit
floral
and
citrus
tastes
all
combined
together
in
the
flavor
taste
hits
up
front
and
top
of
the
mouth
taste
goes
away
quickly
but
there
is
a
lingering
taste
primarily
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
notes
from
12305
im
partial
to
the
style
and
this
is
a
solid
representation
but
not
quite
up
to
my
expectations
bottle
from
the
utah
state
store
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
loads
of
caramel
and
candies
the
taste
was
simple
but
nice
lots
of
sweet
flavors
some
light
hops
a
bit
of
sweet
fruit
and
overall
an
simple
but
enjoyable
brew
a
bit
of
warmth
but
not
overpowering
d
not
my
style
im
moving
on
to
the
next
one
the
taste
is
malty
and
with
strong
musky
grape
sweetness
grain
caramel
wine
with
a
buttery
quality
and
feel
that
is
more
pronounced
near
the
finish
it
has
a
slight
barleywine
quality
resembling
english
barleywine
a
bit
more
than
it
some
tripels
or
say
a
doppelbock
there
is
only
a
weak
hint
of
bitterness
yet
a
clear
alcoholic
character
it
doesnt
compare
to
westmalle
or
some
others
and
lacks
drinkability
not
much
of
a
belgian
brew
the
tripel
is
an
easy
style
to
have
slip
from
your
grasp
and
this
one
amplifies
the
worst
characteristics
while
ignoring
or
sublimating
the
great
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
way
too
sweet
i
really
hate
wasting
beer
but
not
too
sure
if
i
can
finish
the
bottle
d
well
at
10
abv
its
an
ale
to
take
your
time
with
quite
potent
drinkability
is
ok
not
the
best
triple
ive
experienced
but
itll
do
the
trick
a
tough
style
to
nail
not
a
ground
breaking
tripel
but
pretty
good
in
my
book
d
despite
the
alcohol
taste
this
is
pretty
east
to
drink
the
drink
is
smooth
mediumbodied
and
wellcarbonated
nicely
drinkable
d
a
noticeable
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
hinders
drinkability
a
lack
of
complexity
and
yeastiness
also
limits
enjoyment
and
is
only
average
going
down
ok
but
not
one
i
would
probably
go
out
and
buy
again
drinkable
when
only
contemplating
one
bottle
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
than
that
in
a
sitting
this
is
too
thick
and
too
bland
for
the
style
but
there
are
so
many
better
authentic
tripels
out
there
that
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
try
this
again
next
time
i
buy
an
american
brother
this
might
be
due
to
a
poor
pour
on
my
part
aroma
was
crisp
and
fruity
obviously
dubbed
a
triple
due
to
alcohol
and
not
color
color
was
orangey
brown
but
that
doesnt
make
it

with

it
just
isnt

this
is
a
great
beer
but
just
needs
some
balance
overall
not
the
best

that
i
have
had

this
is
a
good
beer
decent
value

relatively

whenever
i
feel

treating
myself
which
is
quite
often
this
brew
will
be
on

by
me
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
all
the
flavours
are
there
and
very
well

reminded
me
of

due
to
the
sweetness

thats
not
a
negative
trait
either

balanced
for
a
tripel
acidy
and
not
too
sweet
it
really
grows
with
degustation
time
i
had
to
change
this
write
up
at
the
end
once
its
complexity
became
more
apparent
the
taste
is
very
good
with
light
caramel
and
gentle
tropical
accent
of
yeast
with
subtle
pepper
and
light
floral
hop
flavor
with
nutty
toasted
malt
taste
with
slight
yeast
mid
palate
and
low
alcohol
in
flavor
with
mild
phenolic
and
light
hop
flaovrs
in
the
mostly
dry
finish
overall
i
consider
this
a
pretty
good
tripel
with
some
nice
spice
elements
from
yeast
with
restrained
alcohol
nice
semidry
taste
with
candy
sugar
evident
mostly
dry
finish
and
refreshing
effervescence
o
this
tripel
hides
its
alcohol
rather
well
and
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
pepper
spices
help
to
cut
through
the
candi
sugars
and
prevent
this
from
being
too
sticky
and
sweet
wow
a
really
rich
beer
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
330
ml
bottle
big
creamy
foam
not
much
retention
yellow
deep
golden
colour
smell
of
ripe
fruits
apple
clove
earth
too
sweet
palate
for
the
style
imo
good
carbonation
taste
of
fruits
apples
apricots
clove
spices
maybe
pepper
good
but
not
great
overall
nicely
complex
and
fruity
and
leaning
to
the
tart
side
of
the
sweettart
dimension
a
pretty
bangon
exemplar
for
the
style
the
big
booze
not
nearly
as
invasive
as
even
in
some
of
the
other
world
beaters
its
still
sweet
sure
but
in
a
seductively
balanced
manner
i
dont
using
consider
procuring
another
when
faced
with
just
one
bottle
of
this
particular
style
but
i
would
not
mind
breaking
that
trend
with
this
one
not
as
fruity
as
chimay
this
is
a
more
no
nonsense
belgian
tripel
best
as
a
presupper
sipper
this
one
was
aged
for
two
years
overall
where
is
the
punchy
variety
of
flavour
hinted
at
by
the
aroma
too
one
dimensional
and
overall
not
memorable
overall
overall
a
very
traditional
triple
and
cornerstone
to
the
style
bottle
or
draft
and
you
cant
go
wrong
this
beer
is
super
awesome
too
is
at
warmed
to
room
temperature
vigorous
pour
from
a
750ml
bomber
into
a
duvel
goblet
at
42f
resulted
in
a
2
finger
meringuelike
head
1
finger
in
3
minutes
mostly
dissipated
at
5
no
lacing
clear
orange
gold
ale
fullface
in
goblet
smell
revealed
slight
yeastiness
nothing
else
i
get
a
sweet
warmth
to
start
finishing
with
a
mildly
medicinal
flat
finish
nice
carbonation
with
pinpoints
fun
to
watch
a
decent
beer
if
its
whats
available
but
dont
need
to
rebuy
o
not
a
bad
triple
at
all
better
than
an
american
version
i
can
think
of
at
8
dollars
a
750
you
cant
beat
it
great
stuff
overall
i
would
not
recommend
this
i
guess
i
have
high
expectations
for
a
begium
beer
i
felt
like
i
was
pouring
champagne
very
bubbly
the
creamy
off
white
head
dissipated
in
just
the
right
amount
of
time
has
a
nice
smell
and
taste
the
only
drawback
is
that
i
am
going
to
have
to
drink
the
whole
thing
because
it
is
a
corked
bottle
750
ml
at
9
abv
the
alcohol
content
is
barely
noticeable
and
i
didnt
realize
it
was
so
high
until
i
started
typing
this
review
whoa
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
a
letdown
from
the
nose
entirely
and
doesnt
have
the
malt
density
that
i
like
for
this
style
hints
at
crisp
at
white
wine
but
doesnt
quite
get
there
either
the
good
news
is
as
it
warms
up
it
gets
a
bit
better
and
with
a
good
candy
sweetness
to
come
through
this
one
takes
time
i
was
totally
surprised
by
this
its
hard
to
go
into
a
beer
without
any
sort
of
expectation
in
todays
world
of
ratings
i
wasnt
blown
away
but
i
loved
the
hell
out
of
this
thing
its
a
straight
up
no
frills
tripel
but
is
put
together
so
well
after
westmalle
most
tripels
meld
together
for
me
this
might
go
the
lead
of
that
tight
knit
pack
o
a
solid
tripel
very
smooth
lots
of
flavors
affligem
tripel
22
oz
bomber
i
got
the
chance
to
sample
this
highly
rated
triple
over
the
weekend
the
body
is
golden
in
color
and
as
clear
as
you
are
careful
keeping
the
sediment
out
of
your
pour
the
head
is
average
and
continuous
carbonation
replenishes
it
during
the
drinking
experience
very
solid
tripel
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
and
champagne
flavor
was
middle
of
the
road
not
outstanding
or
odd
notes
just
solidly
where
a
tripel
should
be
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
did
not
wow
me
as
other
tripels
have
maybe
it
was
my
mood
that
evening
thats
the
tough
part
of
reviewing
beer
there
are
so
many
factors
that
influence
the
experience
of
having
a
beer
to
be
fair
beer
reviews
should
be
head
to
head
comparisons
rather
than
individual
tastings
affligem
tripel
is
a
rich
gold
with
nice
head
and
not
too
much
lacing
the
fine
particles
of
yeast
take
their
time
settling
if
they
settle
at
all
crisp
peppery
floral
aroma
this
is
a
spicy
and
sweet
beer
with
noticeable
alcohol
i
can
understand
why
people
have
tasted
some
apple
and
pear
as
well
dense
stuff
almost
like
a
carbonated
nectar
but
that
rounds
out
the
strong
flavors
very
nicely
whether
it
is
as
good
as
a
trappist
ale
or
la
fin
du
monde
i
cant
say
right
now
id
need
a
sidebyside
comparison
i
think
it
represents
its
style
well
and
is
worth
a
try
o
great
tripel
reminds
me
of
averys
salvation
a
definite
must
try
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
well
constructed
beer
complex
but
simple
and
i
like
that
i
cant
see
this
beer
being
knocked
by
anyone
its
a
rare
commodity
to
find
something
that
can
please
most
crowds
grab
a
glass
and
treat
yourself
you
only
love
once
salud
o
from
the
pour
to
the
taste
to
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
different
brand
of
tripel
everything
is
crisp
and
straightforward
o
heavy
in
flavor
for
a
triple
high
in
alcohol
not
what
i
like
in
a
tripel
but
is
still
good
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
this
beer
can
serve
well
as
either
aperitif
or
nightcap
d
a
very
good
tripel
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
having
tasted
westmalle
last
night
i
would
say
that
this
is
not
quite
on
that
level
yet
but
still
a
great
tripel
option
o
this
is
a
very
good
quality
tripel
i
find
that
the
mouthfeel
and
the
taste
are
on
par
with
most
top
tripels
just
a
great
beer
overall
quite
a
nice
tripel
i
have
not
been
a
big
fan
of
other
affligem
beers
i
have
had
and
this
one
exceeded
my
expectations
final
grade
4
17
an
a
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
tripels
but
i
am
increasingly
becoming
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
so
far
i
wish
this
was
available
at
the
lcbo
yearround
as
it
would
be
a
solid
alternative
to
chimay
and
la
trappes
tripels
a
very
satisfying
choice
for
my
250th
review
clear
gold
and
perfectly
filtered
lots
of
carbonation
coming
off
the
base
of
the
glass
voluminous
white
head
with
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
lacing
and
great
retention
nose
has
sweet
malt
and
bready
notes
moderate
amounts
of
light
fleshed
fruits
and
good
spicing
not
too
bold
but
well
balanced
taste
has
more
sweet
malts
fruitiness
and
is
a
bit
chalky
on
the
palate
but
not
as
much
as
something
like
a
chimay
white
light
metallic
notes
are
present
with
this
at
cellar
temp
but
disappear
as
this
gets
to
room
temp
alcohol
is
there
as
well
not
hot
but
the
flavour
is
certainly
evident
spice
and
booze
in
the
finish
full
body
and
light
prickly
carbonation
an
enjoyable
but
not
outstanding
tripel
a
tripel
im
glad
to
have
tried
and
would
purchase
again
overall
very
drinkable
given
the
abv
and
well
balanced
its
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewer
pick
this
one
up
if
you
happen
to
come
across
it
definitely
my
favorite
offering
from
this
brewery
unfortunately
i
rarely
see
it
so
i
will
need
to
grab
some
more
while
it
is
still
available
hazy
golden
yellow
colour
with
an
average
white
bubbly
head
average
retention
and
lacing
aromas
soft
and
subtle
hinting
at
fruits
bread
and
slightly
metallic
and
citrusy
nice
crisp
pilsner
malt

light
fruitiness
pepper
and
spice
dry
finish
with
a
noticeable
but
not
distracting
alcohol
presence
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
nice
to
see
this
available
in
the
area
good
rendition
of
the
style
with
evident
spicy
notes
somewhat
agree
with
comparisons
to
duvel
golden
blonde
one
finger
of
white
head
not
much
lace
smell
is
full
of
tropical
fruit
yeast
and
clove
fairly
bright

some
candy

well
coriander
perhaps
taste
is
fruity
lightly
sweet
candy
flavours
light

grassy
and
earthy
flavours
come
out
as
well
a
little
spice
in
the
finish
yeasty
aftertaste
with
some
clove
fairly
high
carbonation
creamy
and
pretty
smooth
medium
body
pretty
good
feel
nice
triple
and
you
cant
argue
with
the
price
easy
drinking
and
quite
satisfying
overall
rjt
overall
flavor
is
a
little
bland
but
has
the
sneaky
alcohol
high
carbonation
and
dry
finish
characteristic
of
the
style
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
lots
of
yeast
causing
lots
of
carbonation
scent
is
bready
yeasty
with
some
citrus
hints
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
there
are
of
course
bready
hints
fromthe
yeast
and
some
clove
spice
has
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
if
full
and
smooth
a
very
well
made
tripel
overall
a
solid
tripel
the
flavours
leave
something
to
be
desired
but
it
is
quite
nice
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
goes
down
sooo
well
before
i
knew
it
i
was
almost
done
and
feelin
great
it
was
different
than
what
i
was
expecting
but
a
real
nice
surprise
m
plenty
sweet
plenty
strong
too
a
big
beer
that
is
best
shared
id
be
worried
if
i
got
through
the
entire
bottle
picked
up
a
330
ml
bottle
from
al
campo
bottle
has
23
02
13
meaning
drink
by
date
i
presume
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
cloudy
two
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
14
inch
lacing
head
smell
the
sweet
flowery
slightly
spicy
scent
taste
is
pretty
darn
good
yeasty
tart
fruit
like
a
pear
some
belgian
yeast
in
there
but
the
alcohol
covers
it
not
feeling
much
hop
or
malt
action
closer
to
a
good
white
wine
like
a
pinot
grigio
i
like
it
and
would
try
it
again
when
it
is
a
bit
warmer
what
i
find
unique
and
enjoyable
about
most
belgium
beers
is
their
texture
they
seem
to
play
that
part
stronger
than
most
other
beers
i
thought
that
was
the
strongest
part
of
this
one
affligem
tripel
pours
a
crystal
clear
orange
with
plenty
of
golden
highlights
shining
through
in
the
glass
the
slightly
dirty
white
head
rises
up
to
just
short
of
3
fingers
but
disappears
with
alarming
rapidity
its
clean
too
nothing
left
behind
in
the
way
of
lacing
totally
unacceptable
for
a
belgian
style
beer
the
nose
still
manages
to
shine
through
well
and
its
textbook
tripel
sugar
soaked
stone
fruits
and
clove
spiciness
greet
my
nose
with
a
hint
of
alcoholic
presence
the
flavor
profile
largely
follows
the
blueprint
laid
out
by
the
aroma
theres
some
bitterness
mid
palate
nothing
approaching
an
ipa
in
intensity
but
enough
to
break
up
the
sweet
front
end
and
allow
for
a
transition
to
the
clove
phenols
theres
a
subtle
pleasant
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
that
radiates
out
from
my
center
with
every
sip
the
body
is
impressively
appropriately
light
for
a
beer
of
its
size
and
the
carbonation
bright
and
frothy
it
lacks
the
slight
creamy
edge
that
the
mouthfeel
of
the
best
belgians
have
but
its
just
a
spot
below
affligem
tripel
is
a
very
solid
rendition
of
the
style
appearance
aside
and
one
i
would
give
someone
if
i
was
trying
to
show
them
what
a
tripel
tastes
like
o
a
tripel
through
and
through
solid
profile
characteristics
o
this
is
in
my
top
3
tripels
and
might
be
in
my
top
1
or
2
it
has
a
lot
of
hops
and
yeasty
estery
character
that
exceeds
westmalle
by
a
long
way
and
gives
la
fin
du
monde
a
serious
run
for
its
money
grab
this
if
you
have
the
chance
i
wish
i
had
taken
advantage
a
lot
earlier
than
this
it
is
a
topshelf
tripel
to
be
sure
o
extremely
solid
tripel
and
while
not
the
best
ive
had
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
more
this
is
a
really
good
beer
much
better
to
me
than
a
lot
of
the
reviews
have
suggested
its
a
bit
duvellike
im
glad
ive
got
two
bombers
of
this
o
overall
nice
tripel
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
i
would
try
again
overall
the
flavors
in
here
are
good
but
the
brew
lacks
a
certain
vivacity
and
uniqueness
that
would
set
it
apart
from
its
competitors
and
the
sugary
flavors
tend
to
fade
during
subsequent
sips
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
theres
a
blend
of
flavors
and
none
overwhelm
they
just
blend
into
a
nice
complexity
beers
like
this
are
one
reason
i
love
triples
and
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
drink
3
55
i
though
this
one
tasted
a
lot
like
their
blonde
and
certainly
didnt
make
me
think
tripel
it
was
also
a
bit
too
malty
for
my
liking
and
didnt
really
have
a
lot
of
complexity
the
body
is
light
and
finishes
dry
some
carbonic
bite
some
minor
heat
but
ok
overall
a
good
triple
but
would
like
a
touch
more
esters
and
phenols
overall
while
it
lacks
a
great
mouthfeel
this
beer
makes
up
for
it
by
holding
the
alcohol
and
sugary
sweetness
in
check
too
many
tripels
i
find
suffer
on
both
of
those
fronts
overall
a
solid
tripel
i
didnt
expect
the
grain
flavors
but
they
were
enjoyable
decent
drinkability
o
decent
tripel
pretty
impressive
for
buying
at
a
chain
grocery
store
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
i
would
definitely
have
again
though
it
isnt
the
best
tripel
ive
ever
had
the
higher
alcohol
is
completely
masked
with
this
easydrinking
if
slightly
generic
tripel
good
but
didnt
really
wow
me
overall
love
itwould
do
it
again
overall
pretty
decent
i
wouldnt
exactly
rave
about
this
to
anybody
but
im
satisfied
i
might
even
get
another
if
it
was
on
sale
or
something
d
this
is
a
really
good
brew
and
i
love
a
good
belgian
tripel
huge
two
inch
head
over
clear
yellow
colored
beer
smells
of
spices
yeasts
a
bit
weaker
smell
than
most
trippels
though
tastes
of
bananas
spices
yeast
more
sweet
than
bitter
the
9
abv
is
completely
disguised
for
a
high
abv
its
very
drinkable
slightly
too
sweet
and
cloying
at
times
in
the
aftertaste
and
thats
the
only
thing
holding
it
back
on
drinkability
i
do
recommend
this
for
certain
it
brings
a
much
cheaper
price
tag
than
many
others
n
its
class
yet
it
is
a
competitor
nonetheless
love
getting
my
moneys
worth
i
bought
this
beer
almost
exactly
4
years
ago
and
never
got
around
to
drinking
it
until
now
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
small
khaki
head
aroma
is
buttery
indicating
diacetyl
but
we
later
decided
that
it
was
probably
oxidative
effects
caramel
butterscotch
flavor
not
really
much
classic
tripel
ester
character
it
has
a
bit
of
that
sweet
sherry
taste
that
some
oxidated
beers
get
sorta
oversweet
and
flabby
not
a
great
candidate
for
aging
apparently
o
not
bad
but
very
much
pedestrian
still
a
decent
value
for
money
though
the
beer
is
hazy
and
light
orange
in
color
the
head
is
smallish
and
generates
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beer
is
bready
with
a
healthy
amount
of
citrus
flavors
alcohol
presence
asserts
itself
throughout
though
on
the
whole
i
find
it
unoffensive
this
beer
is
bold
assertive
and
quite
tasty
the
body
is
medium
thick
with
a
warming
finish
another
fine
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
a
cutting
and
barely
staining
texture
not
sharp
as
a
tack
but
still
cleansing
would
pair
well
with
bbq
more
bubbles
than
your
standard
soda
just
heavier
than
medium
bodied
d
quite
d
the
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
the
best
either
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
repeat
a
respectable
and
more
affordable
belgian
tripel
i
could
drink
this
at
almost
any
time
of
day
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
too
much
poured
into
a
rocks
glass
shared
with
others
it
poured
an
opaque
brownish
color
with
big
old
floaties
in
it
smells
strong
and
sweet
of
fruits
booze
the
taste
follows
through
with
a
maltier
profile
and
a
thick
mouth
feel
with
that
alcohol
presence
noted
in
throat
and
nasal
passages
it
was
an
okay
beer
but
leaves
more
to
be
desired
d
was
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
enjoyed
it
through
the
evening
will
definalty
drink
it
again
anyways
highly
recommended
most
excellent
for
sure
and
quite
a
bit
cheaper
here
in
boston
than
many
other
fine
belgians
us9
happy
new
year
everyone
this
is
fairly
enjoyable
but
i
find
the
yeast
profile
somewhat
overbearing
from
the
750
ml
corked
bottle
staamped
1011312
sampled
on
december
10
2010
the
pour
is
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
excited
carbonation
bubbling
upward
to
a
two
inch
fluffy
white
head
that
diminishes
with
time
good
sedimentary
deposits
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
malts
biscuit
yeast
spice
and
overripe
fruit
however
the
alcohol
is
more
noted
in
the
taste
than
i
would
have
hoped
i
prefer
my
belgians
to
be
smooth
yeasty
and
slightly
hopped
it
is
all
of
that
but
the
alcohol
comes
up
a
bit
much
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
the
lightness
makes
it
go
down
easily
its
warmth
makes
it
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
a
cold
night
a
most
excellent
pickup
overall
a
great
example
of
this
style
a
worthy
brew
would
tip
a
few
more
if
not
for
the
9
5
abv
d
easy
to
drink
no
alc
taste
to
it
very
good
but
not
great
amber
disorder
nose
is
an
individual
who
is
the
beautiful
part
in
yeast
mouth
alcohol
in
many
flavors
however
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
alcohol
is
quite
large
logic
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
is
fading
fast
enough
to
leave
his
room
for
various
flavors
the
body
is
oily
but
with
a
touch
sour
probably
due
to
the
sweet
orange
finally
we
have
a
round
mouth
with
a
final
syrupy
good
beer
tasting
a
tripel
with
a
mission
to
stay
on
style
and
be
within
the
front
of
the
pack
mission
ac
complished
equal
to
the
trappist
tripels
for
sure
definitely
a
musttry
if
not
a
regular
indulgence
d
seeing
as
belgian
tripels
are
my
goto
style
ill
call
this
one
as
pretty
drinkable
to
me
its
not
my
favorite
tripel
id
put
westmalle
tripel
at
the
top
of
the
list
and
victorys
golden
monkey
above
this
but
not
by
a
huge
margin
but
id
not
hesitate
for
a
second
if
offered
more
of
it
d
an
easygoing
tripel
that
leans
towards
the
sweeter
side
of
the
style
a
fair
example
with
nice
drinkability
affligem
tripel
from
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
champagne
style
cork
it
poured
a
real
hazy
wheat
color
with
a
half
finger
white
head
a
big
bread
dough
nose
i
dont
get
much
more
than
that
on
the
nose
so
far
im
a
little
disappointed
in
the
appearance
and
smell
there
it
is
this
beer
makes
up
for
it
on
the
first
sip
i
get
a
lot
of
clove
and
some
belgian
style
yeast
and
some
spices
there
is
some
alcohol
heat
right
away
and
i
feel
it
the
entire
time
the
second
sip
brings
a
nutty
slightly
rubbery
taste
its
good
but
just
not
my
style
of
beer
i
still
can
appreciate
and
respect
this
quality
belgian
beer
d
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
even
as
it
reached
room
temp
the
high
abv
never
became
apparent
drinkability
its
good
but
some
of
the
flavors
just
dont
work
for
me
frankly
i
wont
likely
seek
this
out
again
of
course
i
will
finish
this
bottle
however
it
seems
that
westmalle
is
hard
to
beat
drinkability
is
excellent
jd
dthis
beer
goes
down
expceptionally
well
for
it
being
9
5
abv
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
real
beer
lover
overall
a
pretty
good
if
fairly
run
of
the
mill
tripel
worth
a
try
though
d
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
this
tripel
and
ive
known
about
it
for
almost
5
years
its
really
good
and
the
750s
are
still
in
the
78
range
so
its
definitely
worth
a
pickup
good
stuff
d
deviously
easy
to
drink
considering
its
alcohol
content
it
has
a
complex
flavor
that
rises
quickly
and
goes
away
after
a
few
beats
enticing
you
back
for
more
nothing
that
blows
me
away
here
but
its
definitely
a
solid
tripel
the
fact
that
it
was
a
few
dollars
cheaper
than
most
of
the
other
tripels
available
won
some
points
with
me
too
tasty
and
light
a
good
trippel
would
have
again
taste
is
slightly
citrus
fruity
strong
vanilla
and
rich
with
sugary
goodness
alcohol
burns
off
a
bit
on
the
back
end
surprisingly
full
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
im
got
quite
a
bit
of
apple
in
this
as
well
all
of
these
flavors
balance
nicely
for
a
wellrounded
tripel
lots
going
on
and
high
abv
makes
this
drinkable
beer
one
that
isnt
ideal
more
than
a
round
drinkability
for
this
beer
think
subtle
and
complex
rather
than
bold
and
upfront
sipping
this
was
easy
and
ill
probably
be
having
this
one
to
sample
again
however
this
is
a
beer
to
have
on
its
own
if
paired
with
food
some
of
the
subtleties
of
the
beer
will
get
lost
in
its
interaction
with
the
food
poured
hazy
orange
color
with
an
average
frothy
white
head
that
lasted
with
excellent
lacing
complex
spicy
fruit
and
yeasty
aroma
medium
body
with
a
smooth
texture
medium
citrus
balanced
flavor
with
a
medium
sweet
finish
of
moderate
to
moderate
duration
with
a
small
alcohol
bite
this
is
a
refreshing
standout
beer
a
mediocre
belgian
i
have
had
stellar
examples
and
this
pales
d
drinks
pretty
easily
and
hides
its
abv
well
but
the
abv
is
really
too
high
to
drink
a
bunch
in
a
row
d
like
the
dubbel
i
was
not
impressed
at
first
but
the
beer
improved
slightly
as
i
drank
it
however
with
all
the
other
great
tripels
out
there
not
likely
something
i
would
seek
again
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in
a
goblet
style
glass
with
cheese
and
fruit
its
dry
enough
to
suit
most
cheeses
and
fruit
goes
well
with
it
its
only
so
complex
so
as
a
general
rule
it
easily
compliments
many
foods
foods
yet
only
enhances
them
to
a
point
not
bad
kids
of
crisp
has
a
tangy
taste
with
a
peppery
finish
poured
from
the
bottle
an
unfiltered
gold
color
with
a
thick
white
head
which
very
quickly
disappeared
smells
somewhat
like
fresh
citrus
though
that
could
be
related
to
the
cold
i
have
at
the
moment
am
enjoying
this
bottle
with
some
cheese
covered
crackers
mozzerella
and
aged
cheddar
on
some
melba
toast
whole
grain
this
one
is
good
enough
id
drink
it
again
a
very
smooth
beer
overall
a
decent
bottle
of
beer
would
come
back
to
this
one
every
now
and
then
good
value
at
about
9
00bottle
cheers
light
body
relatively
heavy
carbonation
for
the
style
imo
drinkability
is
higher
than
some
other
tripels
but
not
a
brew
that
struck
me
as
great
mmmm
nothing
is
wrong
with
this
beer
thats
for
sure
in
my
oppinion
an
underrated
beer
light
citrus
fruits
cloves
mild
booze
and
a
nice
spice
mixed
in
medium
mouthfeel
and
delicious
carbonation
looked
high
due
to
a
few
bubbles
along
the
glass
but
it
was
just
right
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
affligem
blonde
and
this
is
a
step
above
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
tripel
not
heavy
at
all
an
true
to
style
and
form
recommended
this
bottle
was
a
gift
from
a
good
friend
and
that
always
makes
it
extra
special
thanks
pours
with
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
slightly
opaque
body
the
head
from
the
beer
was
very
light
and
fluffy
i
really
enjoyed
the
smell
from
this
the
fruits
hops
and
malt
really
blended
well
together
the
taste
for
me
only
confirmed
the
smells
can
definitely
taste
the
fruits
used
but
i
cant
identify
which
definitely
more
citrusy
fruits
the
feel
from
it
is
very
nice
although
the
alcohol
conent
keeps
it
from
being
a
highly
drinkable
beer
peachy
blonde
with
a
fluffy
ivory
head
that
melts
slowly
and
leaves
crusty
rings
of
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
beautiful
on
this
one
white
fleshed
fruit
and
citrus
with
dry
champagne
yeast
and
mild
coriander
and
pepper
crisp
and
flavorful
with
slightly
puckery
sweet
and
sour
fruity
esters
and
a
dry
brut
champagne
quality
alcohol
is
well
hidden
medium
bodied
with
a
bright
seltzery
carbonation
a
classic
example
of
the
style
and
highly
drinkable
i
would
enjoy
again
a
very
tasty
drinkable
tripel
i
found
the
alcohol
was
muted
fairly
well
and
didnt
affect
the
overall
experience
well
done
all
in
all
a
good
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
could
be
served
on
a
special
occasion
like
when
your
inlaws
are
over
jk
good
all
around
ale
d
decent
beer
but
it
didnt
wow
me
i
perfer
the
dubble
and
blonde
from
affligem
lightly
sweet
and
prickly
to
the
mouth
the
beer
transitions
nicely
into
a
dry
evaporative
finish
a
great
beer
however
the
breweries
distinctive
water
leaves
the
beer
a
bit
too
minerally
and
metalic
in
the
end
taste
was
strong
belgian
hops
there
is
some
lemon
citrus
as
well
the
finish
is
rather
hoppy
as
well
this
beer
had
a
little
watery
taste
to
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
there
are
better
tripels
d
i
could
drink
another
750
ml
which
is
saying
volumes
considering
the
relatively
high
abv
but
im
sure
id
pay
for
it
the
next
day
nonetheless
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
even
though
its
probably
not
a
session
beer
definitely
a
really
good
sipper
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
i
got
the
last
bottle
of
it
in
the
place
cyclone
liquors
in
ames
ia
smell
and
taste
are
fresh
and
clean
malts
and
hops
like
the
best
of
tripels
next
to
that
there
is
the
spicy
finish
and
the
absence
of
alcoholburn
makes
this
a
top
triple
indeed
a
very
nice
fairly
inexpensive
belgian
tripel
mostly
made
from
ingredients
local
to
where
it
is
brewed
i
find
it
strange
that
heineken
owns
any
monastic
ales
but
such
are
the
times
we
live
in
now
im
kind
of
surprised
that
for
seven
dollars
i
can
get
a
real
belgian
thats
still
so
good
im
willing
to
pay
the
extra
twothree
bucks
for
a
bigger
beer
but
the
affordability
will
be
a
factor
for
some
folks
props
to
these
guys
i
could
see
this
one
being
a
goto
tripel
for
me
at
a
pretty
good
price
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
solid
balanced
beer
not
as
available
as
some
belgians
here
in
the
atl
area
which
is
a
pity
decent
price
for
the
style
i
look
forward
to
visiting
this
tripel
again
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
super
big
creamy
white
head
smells
of
alcohol
malt
and
a
bit
of
pepper
taste
is
dry
but
not
as
dry
as
some
tripels
light
malt
character
yeast
esters
and
some
spices
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
super
high
carbonation
though
a
bit
excessive
drinkability
was
good
not
as
good
as
some
tripels
but
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
super
expensive
though
for
a
750ml
bottle
not
sure
if
i
will
get
this
again
because
of
the
price
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
tripel
that
is
reasonably
priced
slightly
citrus
flavored
for
me
buy
not
a
problem
this
beer
was
pretty
good
considering
the
price
i
was
expecting
something
less
this
beer
came
out
with
a
huge
white
head
half
a
chimay
head
it
was
a
yellow
color
beer
with
white
head
and
had
hints
of
citrus
and
fruit
very
very
refreshing
and
i
could
drink
alot
on
a
hot
day
t
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
tripels
are
among
my
favorite
styles
but
this
one
falls
behind
some
of
the
others
in
its
class
but
still
in
a
pinch
this
one
would
work
perfectly
its
a
bit
sweet
and
spicy
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
abv
to
be
drinkable
and
get
your
moneys
worth
smells
a
little
yeasty
with
ripe
banana
nice
carbonation
grainy
on
the
tongue
with
a
sweet
maltiness
spice
pears
then
with
a
nice
bitterness
that
clears
nicely
on
the
tongue
notes
really
glad
that
i
kept
this
bottle
and
that
it
survived
the
trip
so
that
i
could
enjoy
it
this
evening
i
really
enjoyed
this
with
caramelized
tiger
prawns
glass
noodles
and
jasmine
rice
the
high
alcohol
content
and
9
price
tag
keep
this
from
being
an
everyday
beer
but
ill
definitely
pick
up
this
kickass
tripel
from
time
to
time
750
shared
with
the
dirtman
at
granville
moores
in
the
district
drinkability
good
boys
and
girls
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
hides
its
alcohol
exceedingly
well
which
leads
me
to
believe
that
these
brewers
did
a
great
job
in
putting
this
together
loved
it
till
the
very
last
drop
cheers
beer
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
three
finger
fluffy
head
that
is
holding
quite
well
nose
is
belgian
hints
of
apple
and
pear
with
euro
grains
taste
is
not
overly
complex
but
quite
good
it
is
primarily
apple
and
pear
with
hints
of
white
pepper
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
as
the
belgian
yeast
takes
my
palate
for
a
smooth
ride
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
was
felt
with
the
first
sip
but
fades
quickly
to
the
background
nice
effort
and
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
for
this
price
very
solid
beer
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
was
one
of
the
easier
drinking
beers
of
the
style
i
would
definitely
have
another
this
tripel
pours
a
light
honey
color
and
has
a
pleasant
nose
of
fresh
fruit
stone
fruits
and
honey
wonderfully
balanced
with
layered
and
complex
flavors
of
honey
malt
light
spice
and
lots
of
bananas
a
medium
to
heavy
balance
and
mouthfeel
and
finish
a
second
bottle
at
the
same
tasting
showed
the
same
but
with
even
more
flavors
of
malt
honey
and
peaches
a
wonderfully
drinking
ale
one
that
could
set
a
standard
by
which
others
could
be
judged
overall
a
very
enjoyable
triple
and
the
spicy
qualities
are
quite
unique
in
the
style
went
down
scarily
easy
for
9
5
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
picking
up
again
recommended
the
smell
and
taste
are
a
bit
spicier
than
i
was
expecting
nice
this
meshes
perfectly
with
some
great
carbonation
and
a
nice
light
body
and
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
well
rounded
brew
true
to
style
and
delicious
this
beer
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
tripels
i
have
had
so
one
should
be
careful
d
great
to
share
as
it
is
best
as
a
sipper
overall
a
pretty
good
tripel
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
good
versatile
delicious
and
a
great
value
this
might
be
my
new
goto
trip
nicely
done
example
of
the
style
im
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
while
i
do
enjoy
a
good
tripel
im
not
a
huge
tripel
fan
but
this
one
is
well
done
and
to
style
honey
colour
yelloworange
plenty
of
carbonation
with
suspended
yeast
generous
two
finger
white

sheet
lace
smell
of

bitter
sour
notes
in
the

grapefruit
citrus
passion
fruit
dry
despite
a
smooth
thick
foamy
mouthfeel
with
warming
and
air
there
is
over
ripe
fruit
sourness
again
but
it
seems
a
bit
off
balance
overall
i
cant
say
i
really
enjoyed
this
example
of
a
tripel
mediocre
was
my
impression
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
had
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
and
its
usually
a
good
bargain
6
for
a
750ml
perfect
for
a
nice
sunday
afternoon
working
in
the
sunshine
and
breeze
drinkability
high
this
is
a
belgian
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
again
brouwerij
affligem
has
been
brewing
since
1074
thats
no
guarantee
of
quality
of
course
but
one
bottle
of
their
beer
is
enough
to
convince
anyone
with
a
palate
of
their
zymurgistic
talents
the
proof
as
they
say
is
in
the
pudding
or
in
this
case
in
the
tripel
poured
hazy
peach
color
very
little
head
minor
lacing
aroma
is
kind
of
like
a
toasted
malt
but
slightly
fruity
taste
is
not
as
fruity
or
citruslike
that
i
am
used
to
in
this
type
somewhat
neutral
tasting
nicely
balanced
with
no
overwhelming
notes
of
sweetness
or
bitterness
nice
full
nouthfeel
good
finish
very
good
drinkability
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
by
this
and
i
know
there
are
much
better
options
of
tripels
out
there
notes
this
is
not
the
best
tripel
ive
ever
had
but
its
pretty
darn
good
very
authentic
belgian
that
delivers
enough
depth
of
flavor
and
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
love
tripels
probably
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
overall
seconded
to
chimays
tripel
though
i
wish
the
taste
were
a
bit
more
complex
notes
very
good
not
my
absolute
favorite
but
would
definintely
drink
again
and
try
other
brews
by
affligem
definitely
one
id
have
again
but
i
doubt
that
ill
have
the
chance
since
this
was
a
special
deal
received
from
a
bar
owner
who
had
a
friend
with
a
bunch
of
affligem
giftpacks
to
try
to
get
rid
of
the
4
pack
had
one
dubbel
one
trppel
and
two
regular
ole
affligem
blondes
d
not
the
best
tripel
ive
had
and
the
lingering
bad
aftertaste
isnt
nice
ill
drink
this
beer
but
i
probably
will
not
buy
again
unless
its
a
good
deal
the
drinkability
took
a
bit
of
a
hit
in
that
it
came
only
in
a
larger
bottle
and
with
its
high
abv
you
would
find
yourself
hard
pressed
to
drink
too
mcu
out
of
one
bottle
without
getting
a
bit
too
much
for
your
own
good
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
from
the
nose
but
that
was
expected
yet
it
wasnt
much
of
a
letdown
by
any
means
and
improves
with
a
little
warming
more
yeast
and
citrus
clove
and
cinnamon
a
decent
dose
of
malts
but
not
overdone
by
any
means
feel
and
finish
segue
seamlessly
nicely
done
good
drinkability
within
the
style
not
overly
malty
yet
sufficient
to
keep
the
alcohol
off
the
tongue
a
bit
present
on
the
nose
perhaps
but
it
ends
there
d
im
not
sure
if
this
is
9
5
or
8
5
but
in
either
case
its
a
nice
drinkable
tripple
d
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
nice
750ml
bottle
sat
at
proper
temperature
for
a
couple
days
but
upon
undoing
the
cork
an
effervesence
of
foam
poured
upward
for
nearly
a
minute
yummy
but
unstable
the
pour
was
more
stable
fluffy
white
head
settled
thickly
as
it
sat
it
lessened
remained
with
nice
white
lace
through
the
course
the
color
was
a
fine
dark
golden
honey
with
a
sweet
honeyflowermalt
aroma
the
flavor
likewise
was
such
with
hints
of
spice
that
stuck
in
the
nose
and
a
lingering
alcohol
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
soft
crisp
bubbles
maintained
troughout
and
helped
bring
out
a
slight
rum
flavor
very
smooth
and
drinkable
yet
with
a
sharpness
and
alcohol
that
seemed
to
travel
faster
into
ones
head
this
is
very
drinkable
but
theres
just
not
a
lot
of
character
compared
to
other
belgianstyle
beers
worth
a
try
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
of
short
duration
a
very
thin
blanket
of
lace
lingers
around
the
goblet
just
above
the
brew
a
good
amount
of
sediment
is
suspended
in
the
brew
as
a
few
bubbles
float
to
the
top
haphazardly
big
notes
of
sweet
and
sour
bread
light
fruits
yeast
and
spice
drift
to
the
nose
a
slight
medicinal
aspect
is
also
noted
tastes
fruity
sugary
slighty
tangy
and
a
bit
dry
at
first
further
exploration
reveals
a
good
almost
creamy
base
mixed
with
more
sweet
bread
funky
yeast
some
nutmeg
and
some
furtive
phenols
carbonation
is
excellent
keeping
the
mouthfeel
toward
the
middle
of
medium
the
alcohol
is
well
blended
and
almost
unnoticeable
until
the
very
end
tripels
like
these
remind
me
why
its
my
favorite
style
d
this
is
a
sipping
beer
drink
as
though
it
were
a
fine
wine
a
sip
at
a
time
it
is
best
when
it
is
following
a
forkfull
of
gravydraped
turkey
the
palate
cleansing
qualities
really
will
shine
through
first
beer
from
this
brewery
not
horrid
but
there
are
just
so
many
other
good
tripels
out
there
i
would
fly
with
there
isnt
a
lot
of
malt
character
like
say
a
tripel
karmeliet
but
the
mellow
fruit
esters
spicy
phenol
and
earthy
hops
provide
more
than
enough
character
the
aroma
however
does
hint
at
bready
malt
otherwise
the
flavor
starts
light
and
mild
with
white
grapes
and
white
pepper
then
after
a
moment
big
citrus
rind
and
grassy
hops
kick
in
yum
very
tasy
and
very
drinkable
there
are
more
complex
tripels
no
doubt
but
this
is
still
a
fine
beer
the
aroma
has
light
fruit
yeast
sugar
and
perfume
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
light
haze
and
a
huge
head
that
keeps
lasting
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
some
bitterness
the
palate
is
thin
i
like
this
one
but
it
definitely
isnt
great
d
good
drinkability
very
satisfying
overall
and
definitely
worth
another
visit
pours
a
very
bubbly
golden
yellow
clearish
color
big
head
with
fine
bubbles
an
aroma
of
dark
fruit
plum
and
citrus
rich
but
not
very
strong
bubbly
taste
citrus
and
some
alcohol
not
very
complex
very
light
tasting
but
not
much
flavor
the
drinkability
is
good
due
in
part
to
a
silky
mouthfeel
and
a
complementary
creamy
flavor
overall
very
nice
tripel
that
doesnt
pull
any
punches
what
an
experience
not
the
best
tripel
ive
had
but
arguably
one
of
the
more
interesting
if
the
world
of
tripels
could
be
likened
to
middleaged
men
in
suites
affligem
is
wearing
tennis
shoes
not
a
bad
beer
overall
pored
a
pale
yellow
and
a
small
head
smelled
of
a
yeasty
slightly
nutty
aroma
and
of
some
fruits
tasted
very
carbonated
unusually
high
champaign
like
had
a
fruit
like
taste
but
a
very
dry
finish
kinda
weird
anyway
very
drinkable
but
wasnt
my
favorite
drank
as
i
watcch
the
cowboyeagles
game
a
nice
looking
beer
with
a
pretty
good
head
it
smells
and
tastes
just
great
theres
so
much
going
on
in
the
smell
and
taste
in
a
good
tripel
like
this
i
feel
rather
unqualified
to
analyze
it
all
theres
a
distinct
and
wonderful
yeasty
backbone
to
the
beer
with
a
sweet
dry
finish
the
flavor
is
also
somewhat
spicy
but
i
couldnt
pinpoint
it
the
mouthfeel
is
also
quite
good
the
carbonation
is
bracing
without
going
overboard
i
could
drink
beer
like
this
all
day
its
a
bit
strong
for
that
but
id
settle
for
nursing
one
after
dinner
very
good
tripels
are
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
a
great
example
d
not
the
best
belgian
tripel
but
still
a
great
one
if
you
can
find
it
on
tap
it
is
even
more
impressive
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
real
nice
foamy
head
aroma
is
citrus
fruits
yeasty
and
a
little
grainy
this
is
easy
drinking
with
the
flavors
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
good
belgian
triple
its
got
a
nice
spicy
yeasty
citrus
fruity
flavor
with
a
mild
sour
note
and
a
clean
finish
the
alcohol
content
is
hardly
noticed
until
your
body
tells
you
unless
you
let
the
beer
warm
quite
a
bit
i
have
to
be
honest
i
got
sick
of
it
halfway
through
the
bottle
750ml
bottle
but
maybe
thats
because
ive
had
too
many
triples
lately
even
as
i
did
work
my
way
through
the
bottle
that
foam
remains
on
top
which
produces
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
8
5
a
nice
beer
thats
not
too
hard
to
find
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
my
duvel
tulip
lots
of
carbonation
of
the
bat
creating
a
big
3finger
head
on
top
of
a
clear
golden
brew
notes
of
pilsener
malts
in
the
nose
slight
fruitiness
and
slightly
sweet
taste
follows
suit
a
bit
of
apple
cider
some
perfumey
floral
notes
sweet
in
the
middle
and
dry
on
the
finish
lots
of
carbonation
keeps
this
one
crisp
from
beginning
to
end
an
excellent
brew
but
tastes
for
like
a
golden
ale
than
a
tripel
to
me
nothing
wrong
but
it
is
just
another
triple
to
tick
off
as
having
tried
i
saw
that
this
was
three
dollars
less
than
its
normal
price
so
i
bought
it
solely
for
that
reason
will
probably
go
back
and
get
the
dubbel
soon
too
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
it
was
not
bad
probably
will
not
drink
again
unless
it
is
this
sales
price
or
cheaper
recommended
d
a
decent
triple
but
a
little
underwhelming
in
terms
of
flavor
a
lovely
tripel
not
the
finest
the
world
has
to
offer
but
undoubtedly
superior
to
90
of
the
american
versions
of
the
style
lovely
hungry
belgian
yeast
worth
a
try
for
sure
pours
out
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
good
lace
the
head
stays
intact
the
whole
way
down
it
has
strong
sugar
and
fruit
characteristics
in
the
nose
along
with
ample
amounts
of
spices
the
taste
is
very
crisp
sugar
hops
spices
and
malted
barely
are
the
main
players
in
the
taste
good
beer
nice
example
of
a
tripel
while
it
would
seem
age
has
been
of
detriment
to
this
beer
my
opinions
of
it
have
not
changed
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
the
beer
is
better
off
fresh
although
my
enjoyment
of
it
tonight
was
really
no
different
then
the
few
times
ive
had
it
fresh
affligem
is
certainly
not
the
best
example
of
belgiums
abbey
breweries
and
with
such
a
plethora
of
them
there
is
no
reason
you
should
settle
for
this
particular
one
that
being
said
you
wouldnt
be
so
hard
done
by
if
you
had
to
it
began
gushing
out
of
the
bottle
moments
after
i
opened
it
the
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
thick
white
head
atop
a
golden
body
its
a
really
nice
looking
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
creamy
with
light
carbonation
and
the
smell
had
a
nice
musky
funk
to
it
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
more
than
i
expected
to
really
the
flavor
like
the
aroma
also
changed
fairly
dramatically
as
the
beer
had
time
to
sit
in
the
chalice
it
began
quite
harsh
sour
fruits
meshed
with
strong
alcohol
apple
and
peach
spice
profile
is
very
intense
however
as
it
rested
the
flavor
mellows
greatly
giving
way
to
a
lessened
intensity
of
all
the
aforementioned
flavors
and
a
robust
caramel
maltyness
what
was
initially
sharp
and
eye
opening
is
now
the
quintessential
sipping
beer
not
a
traditional
tripel
by
any
means
as
it
is
much
darker
and
richer
let
this
beer
sit
for
510
minutes
and
enjoy
the
8
5
abv
is
hidden
well
with
this
beer
as
the
yeast
and
the
spices
in
there
combine
for
a
sharp
but
smooth
passing
over
the
tongue
there
is
some
clove
and
lemon
zestorange
also
tasted
apple
in
there
for
that
triple
flavoring
along
with
possibly
pepper
and
clove
a
warm
semidry
finish
i
normally
dont
rate
high
abvs
with
such
drinkability
but
for
the
price
you
cant
go
wrong
buying
a
bottle
of
this
and
just
relaxing
with
this
beer
not
the
greatest
triple
but
a
solid
example
poured
from
a
750

cage
corked
bottle
into
a

it
was
the
only
thing
i
could

at

was
staying

foamy

good

drinkability
took
a

the

cloying

flavor
overall
this
is
a
topnotch
belgian
tripel
true
to
the
style
authentic
fullflavored

satisfying
definitely
recommended
sweet

pours
a

with
a

flavor
is
okay
with
a
sour
finish
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
dry
with
lively
carbonation
very
average
for
a
belgian
tripel
this
is
a
decent
tripel
but
wouldnt
be
the
first
one
i
grabbed
for
given
a
choice
of
several
im
curious
to
try
some
of
the
other
products
in
the
affliigem
line
to
see
if
that
peculiar
taste
is
present
d
i
generally
prefer
my
beers
to
have
more
flavors
and
not
taste
of
alcohol
really
enjoyed
this
a
fairly
easydrinking
tripel
with
some
really
nice
fresh
flavours
d
a
nice
tripel
that
hits
all
the
checkmarks
but
doesnt
thrill
you
worth
checking
out
especially
if
its
easy
to
find
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
great
beer
and
something
ill
pick
up
again
not
one
of
the
top
five
tripels
but
up
there
a
good
strong
trippel
pours
clear
and
carbonation
with
chunks
of
yeast
rather
than
cloudiness
so
be
careful
on
the
pour
good
head
and
appetizing
nose
lacks
the
standard
belgian
trippel
creamy
spiciness
but
is
still
quite
good
very
warming
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
with
some
nut
flavors
and
bright
citrus
flavors
on
the
finish
good
beer
tastes
of
spices
yeast
the
hops
add
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
they
are
balanced
by
a
touch
of
pale
malt

not
my
usual
session
style

this
to
be
an
improvement
on
that
beer
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
great
overall
a
good
tasting
beer
very
drinkable
d
i
would
have
rated
the
drinkability
higher
however
i
dont
believe
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
at
a
time
this
is
kind
of
a
desert
beer
something
to
be
enjoyed
after
a
good
dinner
a
glass
or
two
would
probably
be
the
max
i
would
drink
at
one
time
even
with
abv
aside
this
is
no
session
beer
poured
into
a
snifter
from
a
corked
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
forming
a
very
thin
head
of
bubbles
without
any
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
much
like
fruit
flavored
candy
sweet
and
light
the
taste
is
light
fruit
apples
mostly
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
a
very
drinkable
tripel
overall
not
a
bad
belgian
tripel
not
as
full
flavored
as
some
but
still
a
good
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
d
a
very
good
tripel
very
drinkable
overall
i
really
like
it
it
will
move
into
the
rotation
of
my
belgian
brews
from
this
day
forward
it
has
such
a
wonderful
feel
about
it
i
love
the
way
that
it
hangs
around
my
mouth
after
each
gulp
there
is
a
wonderful
harmony
of
sweetness
spice
and
citrus
those
monks
sure
know
what
they
are
doing
this
one
is
surely
some
of
gods
best
work
pretty
drinkable
i
could
easily
finish
the
750
without
sharing
a
decent
but
not
great
triple
very
drinkable
not
quite
on
a
par
with
st
feuillien
or
st
bernardus
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
the
color
is
a
hazy
mud
puddle
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
orange
big
pillow
white
head
that
dissipated
slowly
and
left
some
real
nice
chunk
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
belgian
candi
sugar
and
green
apples
the
taste
is
of
clove
green
apples
a
bit
medicinal
slightly
metallic
the
feel
is
slightly
over
carbonated
the
fizziness
kills
the
taste
some
a
good
tripel
worthy
of
a
try
on
the
sourtart
side
for
a
tripel
cork
exploded
to
ceiling
pours
a
five
finger
smooth
cream
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
amber
color
strong
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
malty
nose
flavor
sweet
and
tart
finish
is
tart
tastes
different
from
the
last
time
i
had
this
in
122001
6
22
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
smileys
beverages
dover
nh
poured
a
darkish
gold
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
big
fluffy
white
head
almost
overflows
the
glass
aroma
is
bread
cloves
pepper
and
mild
sour
fruits
standard
but
good
flavour
is
quite
sweet
with
some
fruity
sourness
in
the
background
a
little
bit
of
coffee
or
chocolate
in
there
among
the
spices
mild
pine
as
well
which
is
unusual
i
think
good
solid
mouthfeel
although
nothing
special
and
a
sour
aftertaste
that
i
actually
liked
drinkability
not
great
but
not
bad
not
a
big
fan
of
belgians
this
is
a
standard
tasty
tripel
cocktail
with
a
fun
twist
of
belgian
balls
at
the
least
this
beer
will
bring
a
grin
to
ones
face
the
abv
would
explain
the
happy
swimming
glow
in
my
head
still
the
bottle
drains
just
fine
no
knock
on
exceptional
but
sometimes
very
good
is
good
enough
cheers
all
in
all
a
decent
triple
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
worth
a
try
there
are
much
better
triples
out
there
but
its
worth
the
8
or
so
it
costs

very
even
hazy
golden

color
looks
juicy
big
fluffy
and
pillowy
head
which
never
disappeared
entirely
a
somewhat
sloppy
lacing
remained
in
the
glass
as
i
drank
this
aroma
starts
out
nice
with
some
notes
of
bananas
pear
and
apples
and
then
finishes
off
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
this
beer
tastes
just
like
it
smells
too
fruity
up
front
and
alcohol
at
the
back
theres
a
nice
bit
of
clove
and
yeasty
character
in
this
as
well
pretty
tart
and
crisp
in
the
end
nice
and
refreshing
for
a
tripel
light
carbonation
spritzes
up
the
mouthfeel
pretty
nicely
not
a
bad
tripel
at
all
a
decent
tripel
for
the
money
i
would
rather
save
the
trip
across
the
atlantic
and
drink
a
la
fin
du
monde
i
cellared
this
for
a
year
but
i
do
not
know
how
old
the
bottle
was
when
i
purchased
it
i
want
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
as
i
feel
this
one
may
been
on
the
decline
either
way
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
corked
and
caged
750
ml
bottle
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
wow
crystal
clear
beer
with
a
huge
foaming
head
that
slowly
settles
not
leaving
much
lacing
nice
column
of
fizz
rising
from
the
center
of
the
bottom
just
like
duvel
the
smell
is
slightly
yeasty
and
sweet
the
taste
is
of
fresh
ripe
citrus
buttery
and
peppery
slightly
dry
at
the
end
the
alcohol
is
concealed
very
well
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
in
my
opinion
taste
starts
off
very
mellow
with
some
banana
like
phenols
complimenting
the
apple
and
pear
notes
that
were
in
evidence
in
the
nose
very
yeasty
as
well
and
the
whole
thing
reminds
me
of
some
fresh
and
delicious
baking
the
whole
thing
finishes
tart
and
crisp
very
flavourful
clean
uncomplicated
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
thick
theres
lots
of
tasty
malt
in
there
finish
is
lightly
drywith
some
of
the
more
sour
notes
playing
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
an
uncomplicated
and
well
balanced
brew
that
would
insanely
sessionable
if
not
for
the
8
5
abv
certainly
the
best
ive
had
from
this
brewery
great
beer
but
because
of
the
yeast
i
think
a
lot
of
americans
would
be
terrified
to
open
the
bottle
pours
out
a
tangerine
cloudy
colour
not
much
head
retention
for
belgian
which
surprised
me
some
lacing
on
side
of
glass
smell
is
typical
sweet
belgian
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
not
too
spicy
fairly
middle
of
the
road
from
a
flavour
profile
highly
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
think
this
could
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
folks
that
think
leffe
is
the
end
all
and
be
all
of
belgian
brews
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
purchased
as
part
of
a
gift
pack
that
came
with
a
decent
glass
hardly
my
favorite
tripel
though
it
has
quite
an
enjoyable
smell
it
really
falls
down
where
the
taste
is
concerned
not
bad
as
a
beer
but
hardly
an
outstanding
tripel
as
with
other
affligem
beers
its
really
only
worth
getting
if
you
love
trying
different
belgian
beers
this
is
a
smooth
and
creamy
beer
that
goes
down
real
easy
for
its
high
abv
if
i
was
daring
enough
i
could
drink
two
bottles
of
this
bestbefore
number
is
incomrehensible
but
likely
a
new
bottle
cork
pops
out
explosively
and
foam
flows
up
over
the
top
before
i
can
stop
it
on
pour
it
comes
out
a
very
cloudy
gold
with
a
colossal
head
of
airy
foam
nose
is
quite
fruity
with
touch
of
apricot
and
honey
and
a
light
plum
note
taste
is
also
fruity
but
it
mixes
with
an
earthy
gritty
bitterness
and
a
pungent
acidity
for
a
refreshing
but
complex
beer
alcohol
is
notable
in
the
finish
as
well
peppery
and
warming
bottom
line
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
yet
smooth
drinking
tripel
that
id
gladly
get
again
i
recommend

it
right

look

the

as
well
a
solid
and
most
enjoyable
tripel
too
bad
it
loses
some
points
due

it
being
so
alcoholic
still
a
decent
brew
though

it

i
get
back
to
every

comments
this
is
not
the
greatest
of
all
tripels
but
i
strongly
feel
that
it
is
worth
a
try
not
enough
character
to
this
one
for
my
liking
too
much
alcohol
too
bitter
without
offering
enough
of
anything
else

pervasive
in
my
opinion
thick
chunks
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
freely
floating
despite
this
bottle
being
stored
upright
for
2
weeks
the
affligem
dubbel
too
had
uncharacteristically
large
pieces
of
yeast
this
should
be
all
the
vitamin
b
i
need
for
today
nice
rich
golden
hues
caramel
showing
some
orange
tints
near
the
edges
of

it

to
recede
quicker
than
affligems
blond
slow

the
aroma
is
definitely
superior

blond
a
strong
citrus

more
roasted

some

faint
perfume
perhaps
the
slightest
dash
of

tickles

inhaled

taste
is

this
feels

with
a
decent
dryness

ironlike
no
real

feel
on
the
palate
mostly
the
finish
is
musky
grainy
and
yeasty
great
fruit
on
the
long
finish
as
well
full
bodied
and
extremely
lingering
phenols
make
a
show
after
a
few
sips
albeit
slight
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
brisker
carbonation
than
the
dubbel
or
blond
and
for
8
5
this
goes
down
deceptively
freely
and
quickly
after
two
bottles
however
i
fear
the
dry
dustiness
would
become
a
bit
much
for
me
this
would
pair
well
with
any
sharp
cheese
or
a
tomato
sauce
pasta
this
is
a
respectable
tripel
by
any
belgian
standard
thanks
to
mark
at
3
corners
for
this
sample
drinkability
lower
abv
than
most
tripels
means
more
control
of
faculties
while
ordering
this
beer
again
and
again
paired
well
with
breaded
oysters
finally
the
tripel
poured
less
hazy
than
expected
again
no
sendiment
and
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
laces
well
less
spicy
than
the
blond
but
more
banana
and
again
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
smooth
with
a
lot
of
banana
and
mild
spice
with
a
very
warming
finish
i
some
ways
is
combines
the
best
point
of
the
blond
and
the
dubbel
without
the
crispness
and
roasted
malts
of
course
i
really
like
the
spicy
warming
aftertaste
tonight
was
a
very
good
night
this
beautiful
triple
flowed
from
the
bottle
and
created
a
lovely
offwhite
head
of
3
fingers
over
a
hazy
apricotcolored
body
the
nose
is
full
of
fruit
and
spice
notes
these
sensations
repeat
in
the
flavors
of
the
brew
with
spice
and
bananas
predominating
the
feel
is
full
with
a
nice
creaminess
despite
the
carbonation
which
is
substantial
good
drinkability
given
the
abv
poured
from
the
bottle
the
hazy
orange
sunset
of
a
brew
capped
itself
nicely
with
a
fine
white
head
the
aroma
of
bananas
and
spices
was
intriguing
unfortunately
it
seemed
as
these
notes
didnt
dominate
the
flavors
while
banana
and
clove
notes
were
present
mixed
with
a
huskiness
and
sour
apple
notes
that
made
the
brew
a
little
less
enjoyable
than
i
had
hoped
while
a
sour
beer
can
be
fun
it
didnt
seem
to
work
well
with
this
triple
i
was
quite
impessed
with
this
one
personally
it
looked
nice
had
a
pleasant
smell
a
nice
texture
and
i
just
overall
enjoied
it
i
saw
where
a
few
people
had
said
that
given
the
style
this
wasnt
really
quite
what
it
should
have
been
or
what
they
thought
it
would
have
been
rather
i
thought
it
was
fantastic
though
poured
a
bronzeorange
colour
with
a
monster
white
fluffy
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
nice
lacing
very
spicy
sweet
smell
with
a
good
bit
of
banana
taste
was
fairly
congruent
with
smell
as
far
as
spice
and
banana
go
nice
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
ruin
the
mouthfeel
a
nice
warming
sensation
as
it
goes
down
due
to
the
8
5abv
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
i
seem
to
think
so
anyway
brisk
finish
zesty
still
rough
a
bit
charmless
a
very
fine
ale
highly
recommended
sedimented
apricot
appearance
glows
in
the
light
head
is
huge
and
very
soft
like
pillow
foam
laces
thicky
in
lots
of
hanging
strings
and
sheets
tons
of
aroma
plenty
of
grape
orange
yeast
notes
and
a
light
sense
of
blackboard
slate
impressive
taste
wellbittered
up
front
medium
carbonation
and
an
astringent
marmalade
impression
dries
well
with
alcoholic
heat
and
a
strident
finish
and
aridity
thats
almost
like
an
asphaltlike
bitterness
bold
stokes
here
westmalle
seems
safer
but
this
is
about
as
close
to
what
i
expect
from
a
tripel
as
ive
run
across
would
be
just
about
right
when
im
in
the
mood
very
drinkable
belgian
brew
pours
a
pale
burnt
orange
that
is
slightly
hazed
with
a
nice
dense
white
head
that
lasts
a
while
the
smell
consists
of
a
sweet
musty
horse
blanket
fruit
and
light
spicing
the
taste
is
a
lightly
sweet
fruit
and
raisins
with
a
musty
yeast
taste
trailing
into
a
light
alcohol
on
the
tail
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
drinks
down
fairly
easy
poured
a
cloudy
golden
orange
head
quickly
settled
down
to
a
pinkys
width
and
stuck
around
for
awhile
great
lacing
on
this
smells
of
sweet
oranges
and
spice
with
an
added
taste
of
pepper
and
candy
slight
tingling
on
the
tongue
smooth
down
the
back
this
tripel
was
a
great
find
and
one
ill
be
picking
up
again
and
again
if
you
like
la
fin
youll
love
this
holy
smokes
look
at
the
psycho
motion
going
on
in
this
coarse
bubbly
dirty
white
head
denser
on
second
pour
there
is
lots
and
lots
of
soapy
lacing
the
beer
itself
is
orangeygold
and
slightly
hazy
nose
is
citrus
sweet
and
a
little
woody
alcohol
is
there
spice
and
pepper
in
the
sweet
fruity
front
thick
foaminess
in
the
middle
sweet
buttery
fruity
caramely
the
finish
tastes
just
like
snow
plus
some
fruit
and
lots
of
alcohol
this
is
a
nice
pleasant
beer
if
just
a
little
plain
as
an
interesting
afternote
i
only
drank
half
of
this
750
and
then
tested
a
new
champagne
saver
on
the
bottle
to
see
how
it
stands
up
to
time
after
2
days
i
noticed
a
light
leak
it
was
on
its
side
and
i
opened
it
and
drank
the
rest
the
head
was
almost
gone
but
surprisingly
there
was
still
a
little
left
the
flavor
had
separated
into
a
base
of
light
syrupy
sweetness
and
higher
notes
of
citrus
pepper
tart
and
hops
it
was
actually
a
little
creamier
than
when
first
opened
too
really
quite
a
nice
surprise
i
thought
it
would
be
bad
extra
points
for
this
brew
the
bottle
was
dated
best
before
21
12
02
two
years
earlier
my
first
thought
is
mmmm
well
aged
the
cork
was
a
pain
but
then
when
it
did
move
pow
out
it
came
the
brew
was
clouded
but
with
a
nice
honey
hue
the
nose
was
candied
with
a
wonderful
feel
in
the
mouth
not
overly
carbonated
but
noticeable
as
a
belgium
bier
the
taste
was
exciting
the
balance
outstanding
the
hops
are
not
hiding
behind
the
candy
and
all
the
flavors
coexist
peacefully
this
is
the
best
out
of
date
beer
ive
ever
had
gotta
love
those
friars
you
cant
stay
in
the
brewing
business
for
close
to
900
years
without
doing
something
right
this
is
a
nice
very
drinkable
tripel
rich
bronze
in
color
with
a
moderatelysized
very
lacy
head
fed
by
a
jetstream
of
carbonation
aroma
is
orange
citrus
and
spicy
clove
hops
undergirded
by
bready
yeast
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
citrus
tang
strike
the
tongue
first
followed
by
a
fairly
sweet
almost
caramellike
maltiness
nice
spicy
hop
kick
toward
the
finish
with
a
surprising
slightly
sour
aftertaste
fairly
fullbodied
in
the
mouth
but
the
carbonation
and
the
persistant
head
keep
it
from
becoming
overwhelming
very
nicely
done
possess
a
nice
light
color
and
pleasant
nose
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
brew
was
tangy
yet
sweet
but
nicely
balanced
between
the
two
as
it
went
down
it
warmed
inside
to
a
smile
the
carbonation
reminded
me
of
a
good
quality
champagne
carbonation
very
pleasant
this
nice
golden
triple
was
a
nice
dark
golden
colour
with
a
lovely
white
cap
of
foam
on
its
head
aromas
were
very
sweet
and
honeylike
with
some
candy
sugar
and
yeast
in
the
mix
as
well
the
taste
was
very
sweet
just
like
the
aroma
i
could
taste
light
hops
and
malts
candy
sugar
yeast
various
spices
and
alcohol
on
my
palate
the
mouthfeel
was
spritzy
highly
carbonated
and
full
of
life
the
drinkability
was
damn
good
knew
i
was
in
for
a
treat
cause
the
bottle
was
dated
best
before
503
poured
a
nice
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
green
apples
yeast
malty
sweetness
and
alcohol
dominated
the
nose
very
sweet
effervescent
yeasty
and
slightly
cidery
tasting
with
a
big
dry
granny
smith
apple
finish
this
beer
seemed
highly
attenuated
therefore
making
it
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
im
stocking
up
on
a
few
more
bottles
from
this
dating
pours
to
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
medicinal
with
a
fresh
fruity
aroma
the
flavor
is
spicy
peppery
with
an
herbalmedicinal
taste
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
but
has
an
alcoholic
warming
to
it
it
finishes
dry
another
good
belgian
beer
pours
a
nice
slighlty
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
head
the
aroma
is
pleasant
with
a
mixture
of
yeast
citrus
hops
and
grass
the
taste
is
strong
on
the
tongue
carbonationed
seemed
a
little
high
but
the
yeast
malt
bitter
ratio
was
good
crisp
in
the
mouth
and
bitterness
and
citrus
tones
lingered
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
the
alcohol
is
quite
evident
and
when
the
bottle
is
empty
you
can
feel
it
very
enjoyable
and
my
favorite
from
affligem
drinkability
a
nice
beer
very
decent
but
not
my
favorite
tripel
i
only
sampled
1
so
maybe
a
few
more
would
give
me
a
better
idea
of
how
i
feel
huge
rocky
head
with
definite
belgian
lace
and
a
deep
gold
color
aroma
is
subtle
and
complex
with
a
definite
mineral
scent
and
light
dry
malt
flavor
is
nice
with
spiciness
from
the
yeast
alternating
with
a
dry
maltiness
a
bit
of
hops
running
around
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
just
perfect
for
this
beer
as
there
is
enough
of
a
rough
carbonic
bite
to
keep
the
mouth
from
getting
bored
while
there
is
not
so
much
as
to
overpower
the
palate
i
would
try
this
one
again
because
i
think
that
there
is
more
going
on
here
than
what
one
can
experience
from
one
tasting
session
worth
6
99

definitely
blonde
gold
color
extremely
large
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
fruity
yeasty
and
sweet
a
medium
bodied
tripel
malts
are
fruity
and
sweet
hops
are
spicy
bright
yeasts
with
touches
of
candy
sugar
a
very
drinkable
beer
once
the
head
diminishes
nicely
balanced
smooth
taste
very
slight
alcohol
bite
at
8
5
touches
of
apricots
and
oranges
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
drinkability

this
one
was
ok
but
it
lacked
the
sense
of
balance
and
smoothness
that
ive
come
to
enjoy
in
the
style
aroma
and
taste
were
both
extremely
mild
you
get
the
typical
spiciness
and
hint
of
fruit
but
overall
the
taste
was
way
too
mild
still
not
bad
just
average
i
wont
buy
any
more
of
this
a
very
belgian
aroma
earthy
fruits
ripe
yellow
apples
et
cetera
sweet
fruity
and
spicy
as
it
should
be
the
esters
and
flavors
are
mopped
up
quickly
by
quite
the
surprisingly
crisp
finish
i
almost
didnt
want
any
beer
tonight
but
made
the
commitment
with
this
750ml
bottle
i
wont
be
getting
up
early
in
the
morning
but
it
would
have
been
worth
it
a
very
fine
abbey
tripel
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
nice
tight
carbonation
the
head
actually
increased
for
the
first
few
minutes
before
settling
in
at
about
a
quarter
inch
that
lasts
till
the
end
the
aroma
was
of
fruit
and
malt
with
a
lot
of
yeast
and
a
presence
of
alcohol
taste
is
good
with
bread
and
malt
but
hurt
by
a
rubbery
and
sour
note
a
good
beer
at
a
good
price
thick
foamy
head
it
grows
slowly
for
a
while
after
being
poured
and
forms
some
interesting
statuelike
creations
about
a
quarter
inch
of
head
remains
and
plenty
of
lacing
the
beer
looks
darks
and
murky
muddy
smells
of
pears
and
spices
and
is
a
little
sweet
tastes
slightly
of
pears
as
well
thick
and
creamy
interesting
spiciness
that
lingers
not
the
best
triple
that
ive
had
but
its
pretty
good
one
of
my
first
double
fermented
ales
not
nearly
as
chewey
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
flavor
is
excellent
just
like
the
bottle
says
intense
robust
nutty
a
little
too
rich
to
really
be
called
drinkable
but
excellent
nonetheless
i
would
buy
it
again
pours
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
large
stream
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
dead
center
of
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
brilliant
white
head
towers
out
of
the
glass
and
very
slowly
dissipates
in
chunks
leaving
a
thick
rocky
head
and
spider
webs
of
lace
across
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
notes
of
banana

and
nutmeg
medium
to
full

with
a
smooth
velvety
texture
taste
is
sweet
malts
at
first
followed
by
notes
of
fruit
and
allspice
some
nutty
yeasts
are
then
present
along
with
some
peppery
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
citrus
leading
to
a
dry
finish
a
very
nice
triple
drop
a
coaster
under
the
glass
before
pouring
this
one
a
huge
white
head
foams
up
on
top
of
a
glass
of
nice
looking
beer
thats
yellow
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
lace
sticks
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
nice
and
spicy
with
distinctive
notes
of
yeast
the
flavor
starts
out
nice
and
improves
as
the
beer
warms
in
addition
to
spicy
flavors
with
a
nice
residual
sweetness
thats
a
bit
honeylike
its
very
drinkable
and
overall
a
very
nice
beer
experience
this
beer
poured
a
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
little
of
tight
white
foam
and
nice
lace
the
smell
had
a
fruity
and
malty
aroma
the
taste
was
of
a
fruity
nature
and
a
soft
sweet
maltiness
lively
in
the
mouth
and
a
feel
of
brut
champagne
in
the
finish
nice
balance
of
sweetnessbitterness
on
the
finish
also
drinkability
very
good
this
was
quite
a
tasty
tripel
leaving
me
wanting
more
worthy
of
a
closer
look
for
those
who
are
tripel
enthusiasts
its
crisp
and
wellcarbonated
with
flavors
of
apple
ripe
pear
strong
doughy
yeast
and
a
bit
of
citrus
the
alcohol
remains
subdued
carrying
the
flavor
nicely
though
the
mouth
and
nose
its
somewhat
spicy
in
the
middle
theres
just
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
quite
as
complex
as
some
other
tripels
but
smooth
and
flavorful
nonetheless
worth
a
try
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
and
formed
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
citrus
and
spices
such
as
clove
a
flavor
of
clove
slight
bit
of
grain
with
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
the
finish
is
light
and
a
touch
tangy
no
doubt
reflecting
the
carbonation
present
the
pour
somewhat
hazy
yellowishorange
or
light
amber
if
you
like
the
head
is
pertinent
in
size
frothy
the
lace
in
delicate
sheets
and
both
light
beige
in
color
nose
has
lots
of
yeast
a
little
malt
and
some
fruit
tones
also
noticed
citrus
like
crispness
starts
malt
sweet
the
top
skinny
finish
is
intermediately
acidic
somewhat
sour
soso
in
the
hops
department
a
quite
quaffable
beer
worth
a
sample
at
any
rate
im
guessing
here
but
3
years
seems
like
a
logical
median
to
drink
this
fresh
it
is
too
raw
and
hot
and
at
whatever
age
this
is
56
yo
its
gentrified
and
apathetic
while
overall
better
in
its
old
age
i
feel
like
i
missed
its
prime
notes
not
too
shabby
for
a
triple
i
have
had
both
fresh
and
aged
sample
of
this
brew
and
have
to
say
that
it
is
more
than
a
decent
pick
for
the
style
and
is
unquestionably
worth
a
try
ive
had
this
beer
before
about
a
year
ago
but
this
time
was
a
bit
different
still
a
big
creamy
head
good
lace
nice
aroma
this
time
the
taste
or
should
i
say
lack
of
was
a
bit
off
i
can
confirm
the
date
on
the
bottle
was
05
of
03
but
there
was
something
missing
it
wasnt
the
carbonation
which
was
very
nice
the
spicey
nose
and
taste
was
still
there
but
the
finish
lacked
a
big
shall
i
say
finish
everything
is
there
but
for
a
belgian
a
bigger
finish
would
have
made
all
the
difference
the
impressively
thick
persistent
porcelain
white
head
sits
atop
a
slightly
hazy
dark
golden
hued
brew
true
belgian
lace
is
left
cidery
sweetness
and
yeast
mustiness
dominate
the
aroma
but
medicinal
phenol
peppery
ethyl
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
heaty
fusel
alcohols
are
present
as
well
sharp
prickly
carbonation
hits
the
palate
up
front
then
yields
to
honey
sweetness
and
pleasant
clovey
phenol
absent
of
the
medicinal
phenol
present
in
the
aroma
mild
mustiness
and
a
trace
note
of
rubbery
yeast
autolysis
prevents
this
tripel
from
reaching
its
intended
goal
in
flavor
very
well
attenuated
and
quite
dry
finishes
with
more
mustiness
and
black
licorice
notes
quickly
fading
affligem
tripel
although
a
flavorful
brew
was
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
and
lacked
the
refinement
of
a
good
tripel
a
touch
disappointing
but
it
helped
alleviate
my
craving
for
a
belgian
strong
tripel
its
still
worth
a
taste
however
300
very
nice
floral
hop
aroma
nice
soft
yeast
aroma
aswell
very
smooth
spicy
start
slight
sweet
and
then
leading
to
a
bitter
finish
i
think
affligem
is
a
bit
underated
in
my
opinion
an
excellent
brew
nice
soft
spicy
flavour
aswell
slight
hop
flower
and
alcohol
smell
to
the
cork
very
carbonated
on
the
pour
be
careful
yeasthop

with
a
hint
of
sweetness
bright
gold
hazy
look
there
is
a
ton
of
little
bubbles
in
the
center
of
the
goblet
after
the
pour
you
will
wait
a
while
for
the
peaks
of
slightly
off
white
head
to
disapate
go
take
a
bathroom
break
taste
is
one
of
malt
sweetness
and
slight
metalmineral
tongue
followed
by
a
bitter
dry
abv
grapefruit
finish
very
interesting
brew
the
finish
is
quite
overwhelming
which
affects
drinkability
the
spiciness
of
the
alcohol
and
yeast
flavors
werent
as
strong
in
this
beer
as
some
of
the
other
strong
belgians
i
had
lately
and
despite
the
huge
amount
of
yeast
floating
in
the
glass
i
let
it
sit
for
days
before
pouring
and
the
last
quarter
of
the
bottle
wouldnt
fit
in
the
glass
it
had
an
unexpectedly
sharp
and
clean
taste
with
some
notes
of
orange
or
lemon
an
interesting
brew
fruity
alcoholic
aroma
champagne
like
effervescence
and
taste
big
white
foamy
head
with
no
lace
on
the
glass
it
mellowed
a
bit
after
warming
bringing
forth
the
malt
alcohol
and
fruit
character
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
clean
beer
snifter
extraordinary
head
retention
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
this
before
in
fact
i
wanted
to
sip
it
but
i
declined
because
i
wanted
to
see
how
long
the
head
actually
stayed
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
with
the
slight
candi
sugar
presence
that
most
belgian
brews
have
very
light
in
color
about
810
srm
tastes
of
sweet
estery
goodness
i
get
subtle
banana
golden
raisins
and
wheat
upon
first
sip
following
the
next
few
sips
i
get
some
port
wine
on
the
palete
as
a
10
abv
triple
its
the
strongest
one
ever
had
however
its
the
best
overall
up
to
and
including
the
later
brews
these
guys
just
crush
it
for
me
one
of
my
favorites
although
i
see
their
beer
so
rarely
its
always
a
treat
to
find
one
this
is
a
real
heady
tripel
foamy
as
can
be
in
the
tulip
bone
white
several
inches
on
a
slightly
cloudy
blonde
straw
colored
base
beer
the
nose
is
sweet
like
most
tripels
but
this
one
for
me
is
more
about
the
yeast
it
feels
rustic
and
ancient
summery
and
different
not
so
fruity
in
flavor
as
other
but
not
spicy
either
its
sort
of
off
the
spectrum
in
that
regard
which
i
like
a
lot
has
a
mustiness
to
it
as
well
which
suits
the
sweeter
base
beer
maybe
some
oats
in
here
there
is
plenty
of
body
and
i
am
surprised
to
learn
its
so
strong
it
drinks
so
much
easier
than
this
with
its
effervescent
carbonation
and
only
medium
body
a
bit
of
lingering
sweetness
but
made
appealing
by
its
interaction
with
the
yeast
flavor
as
it
goes
down
so
cool
to
have
this
one
on
draft
i
need
to
find
more
of
their
stuff
i
am
not
usually
a
huge
tripel
guy
but
this
one
ranks
wish
i
had
more
time
to
write
a
more
indepth
review
but
the
short
version
is
that
its
fantastic
wow
it
made
it
america
in
one
piece
it
still
held
its
head
ive
been
so
disapointed
in
what
we
are
getting
in
florida
lately
chimay
headless
how
dare
they
great
beer
bier
hit
all
the
right
notes
right
up
there
with
the
better
triples
o
this
is
a
delicious
complex
and
satisfying
beer
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
clean
and
fresh
and
really
pop
overall
world
class
extremely
complex
bold
and
drinkable
stays
true
to
style
while
affirming
its
own
identity
o
great
belgian
triple
sweetness
covers
the
high
abv
very
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
triple
from
a
great
brewery
osolid
triple
good
range
of
flavor
enjoyed
sipping
this
a
little
bit
sparkling
but
dont
worry
nice
beer
all
around
i
always
have
difficulty
and
a
personal
preference
against
triples
that
come
off
sweeter
and
this
one
toes
the
line
overall
textbook
triple
quite
warming
but
hidden
by
the
nice
fruit
sweetness
held
up
well
over
3
years
recommended
if
triples
are
your
thing
overall
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
a
bit
past
its
prime
i
was
hoping
to
get
a
nice
aged
beer
but
this
one
has
been
on
the
shelf
a
bit
too
long
hopefully
i
will
be
able
to
try
a
fresh
sample

with
mild

and
sweet
alcohol
overall
a
very
good
tasty
and
all
around
flavorful
brew
very
nice
othis
is
a
pretty
solid
tripel
it
is
very
aggressive
with
the
alcohol
but
the
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
so
the
beer
manages
to
get
away
with
being
so
inmyface
the
hops
are
especially
welldone
here
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fizzy
for
my
liking
in
a
tripel
but
overall
this
a
solid
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
if
i
need
a
break
from
my
usual
karmeliet
fix
seemed
to
me
like
a
mix
of
belgian
ipa
with
a
tripel
an
alcoholic
punch
and
a
bit
too
sweet
resulting
in
low
drinkability
a
must
for
tripel

with

of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
small
chunks
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
honey
fruit
and
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
earthy
malt
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
has
flavors
that
are
a
bit
more
earthy
than
the
smell
would
indicate
od
great
stuff
very
nice
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
so
many
layers
definitely
one
of
the
better
tripels
out
there
very
drinkable
but
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
get
through
half
great
stuff
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dull
amber
with
billowing

ill
always
have
a
weakness
from

clean

potent

not

often
gorgeously

de
dolle

this
one
a
definite
classic
lots
of
honey
clover
yeast
bubblegum
clove
all
the
classic
profiles
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
rank
this
amongst
the
best
tripels
i
have
had
it
is
smooth
light
tasty
flowery
and
and
just
good
to
drink
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
never
fizzy
but
gently
foamy
and
smooth
ethanol
is
rather
easily
noticeable
on
the
throat
and
in
the
nostrils
less
so
on
the
tongue
and
particularly
so
after
each
sip
when
the
beer
warms
somewhat
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
lively
but
not
overdone
amount
of
carbonation
the
flavors
are
spot
on
for
what
anyone
could
wantexpect
in
a
tripel
however
despite
this
brew
having
quite
a
bit
of
age
on
it
the
alcohol
is
well
pronounced
but
integrated
fairly
decently
in
this
brew
if
anything
the
warmth
of
this
brew
distracts
just
a
bit
from
the
overall
ease
of
drinkability
the
last
time
i
had
this
brew
it
was
from
a
750ml
that
was
17
years
old
it
was
not
the
best
of
experiences
but
this
even
with
its
own
significant
aging
was
much
better
i
am
curious
now
about
having
a
bottle
as
fresh
as
possible
just
for
the
sake
of
comparison
if
you
havent
had
this
yet
what
are
you
waiting
for
i
will
need
to
put
this
on
the
todo
list
to
grab
more
of
these
when
i
see
them
o
hard
to
drink
semi
nice
aromas
simply
too
boozy
i
wont
buy
this
again
2002
vintage
by
now
she
must
indeed
be
pretty
pissed
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
lightlyhazy
ambergold
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
banana
mild
vanilla
wheat
mild
booze
and
light
orange
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
good
deal
more
funk
and
tartness
which
actually
kinda
works
here
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
somewhat
sticky
finish
overall
a
surprisingly
tasty
tripel
one
whose
age
and
abnormal
characteristics
somehow
havent
had
any
negative
influence
on
things
but
rather
seem
to
have
augmented
them
eversoslightly
o
terrific
tripel
and
one
ill
go
back
to
again
d
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
fatigue
the
palate
even
though
you
expect
it
to
with
its
strong
aroma
and
high
abv
level
to
some
extent
the
phenolicalcoholic
finish
does
limit
the
drinkability
some
but
i
certainly
didnt
want
it
stop
at
one
with
this
beer
o
excellent
drinkability
great
beer
de
dolle
quality
o
an
intense
tripel
with
alot
of
personality

the
33
cl
bottle

at

and
gin
house

a
beer
well
worth
trying
if
youre
looking
for
an
education
in
belgian
beers
simply
put
this
beer
is
rather
amazing
super
dry
yet
super
sweet
and
everything
in
between
i
love
it
man
been
a
very
long
time
since
ive
had
this
beer
and
ive
probably
been
doing
myself
a
disservice
so
smooth
and
distinct
really
even
and
well
balanced
great
character
with
things
staying
consistent
and
even
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
delivering
a
great
body
of
flavor
that
shows
clear
brewing
expertise
a
must
try
for
all
beer
lovers
i
love
this
brewery
and
i
love
all
their
beers
poured
a
massive
allhead
in
a
vanilla
cream
froth
with
long
life
the
body
is
a
hazy
golden
yellow
not
much
of
a
smell
initially
but
caramel
and
dried
fruit
slowly
emerge
the
taste
is
quite
complex
with
candies
like
butterscotch
and
caramel
fruits
like
pineapple
and
fig
and
a
touch
of
sourness
long
finish
nice
tripel
overall
very
tasty
and
easy
to
enjoy
the
sweetness
is
slighty
overpowering
therefor
taking
away
from
the
balance
of
a
world
class
tripel
if
you
like
tripels
or
very
sweet
floral
belgium
beers
this
is
a
must
try
cant
touch
st
bernardus
or
la
fin
du
monde
in
balance
and
price
but
is
for
sure
worth
a
drink
this
borders
on
being
too
spicy
sticking
to
the
back
of
your
throat
but
it
never
gets
there
thats
commendable
but
it
could
use
some
banana
esters
to
balance
that
out
lots
of
goodness
in
here
but
a
bit
too
heavy
to
make
it
an
excellent
tripel
o
high
score
for
originality
and
overall
gravitas
an
indulgent
asskicker
o
very
nice
maybe
a
little
too
boozy
for
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
o
this
is
a
great
tripel
maybe
a
little
slightly
too
sweet
but
i
like
it
4s
on
the
board
o
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
strong
but
welldisguised
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
stronger
belgianstyle
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
pours
an
absolutely
ideal
shade
of
gold
a
bubbly
fluffy
head
is
perched
upon
the
top
thanks
to
the
strong
continuous
carbonation
no
visible
sediment
very
picturesque
the
aroma
is
practically
godlike
a
complex
and
intriguing
marriage
of
bitter
and
sweet
desirable
yeast
aroma
is
present
along
with
caramel
both
sweet
and
sour
apples

and
bready
belgian
yeast
and

tart

tropical

lemony
hints
spicy
phenolic
characteristics
as
well
as
a
definite
bitter
hop
presence
honey
although
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
may
have
suggested
this
beer
really
coats
the
mouth
well
and
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
some
belgians
are
borderline
cloyingly
sweet
with
no
other
complexities
not
so
at
all
with
this
masterpiece
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
i
cannot
imagine
how
this
could
get
any
better
o
certainly
a
very
big
and
loud
tripel
whew
aroma
and
taste
are
very
strong
carbonation
is
high
to
boot
lots
of
pepper
almost
overly
so
and
belgian
yeast
in
this
one
for
sure
excellent
example
of
the
style
incredibly
smooth
triple
very
nice
flavor
all
of
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
and
glass
was
not
very
appealing
so
ill
need
to
track
down
a
fresh
bottle
and
give
it
another
shot
overall
an
incredibly
nice
beer
update
paired
with
chimay
cheese
and
noticed
a
little
sweet
booze
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
otherwise
very
well
concealed
for
10
percent
appearance
is
a
dark
golden
tone
with
a
big
frothy
head
its
nose
has
candy
booze
citrus
and
belgian

upon
sipping
this
serious
tripel
and
i
taste
bread
vanilla
caramel
and
bit
of
a
sour
aspect
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
a
nice
sharp
sweet
finish
a
very
nice
tripel
one
of
my
favorites
out
there
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
would
drink
many
more
if
i
werent
already
drunk
and
had
any
extras
for
a
10
beer
i
am
completely
sold
i
was
sceptically
to
spend
7
on
this
one
but
i
understand
the
price
tag
given
the
robust
flavor
and
extremely
satiating

flavor

stone

apple
oranges
finishes
much
dryer
with
the

and
cloves
asserting
a
sharper

and
a
bit
of
a
floral
element
quite
a
delicious
start
and
pleasant
flavor
progression
medium
bodied
a
quite
enjoyable
and
well
made
tripel
i
enjoyed
this
more
and
more
as
it
opened
up
in
the
glass
over
time
o
glad
i
had
it
nice
performance
in
a
lot
of
categories
worthy
buy
o
another
standout
beer
from
de
dolle
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavier
then
average
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
of
the
style
it
was
pretty
balanced
flavorful
and
relatively
easy
drinking
for
the
style
ps
i
also
dont
see
any
reason
why
this
label
costs
50
more
than
st
bernardus
guldenberg
westmalle
or
other
great
beersbrewers
o
easily
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
tried
and
although
it
isnt
my
favorite
style
its
very
clear
that
this
is
a
very
respectable
beer
very
decent
not
a
top
favorite
but
one
of
the
good
ones
i
didnt
dislike
this
beer
but
it
didnt
make
a
huge
impression
either
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
but
i
will
never
pay
that
price
for
it
in
the
future
also
for
that
kind
of
money
it
should
have
been
served
in
the
proper
glass
one
of
my
all
time
favs
served
at
a
great
temp
with
a
grand
billowy
soft
foamy
frothy
fluffy
off
white
head
that
sits
there
for
a
while
before
burping
and
lots
of
clingy
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
loads
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
yeast
on
top
then
malt
vineous
flavor
is
like
nose
with
lots
of
yeast
bitterness
followed
by
hop
just
a
little
sweet
good
carbonic
tang
white
wine
apples
pears
hint
of
funk
body
is
champagne
like
expansive
yet
of
substance
and
carbonation
is
out
of
sight
finish
is
like
flavor
without
flaws
and
lingers
pleasingly
with
a
friendly
alcohol
warmth
dont
know
of
another
tripel
like
it
delightful
beer
from
the
mad
brewers
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
spicy
and
has
some
sweet
grainy
aromas
in
there
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
i
felt
like
that
this
beer
wasnt
as
good
as
it
should
be
flavorwise
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
solid
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
beer
was
good
but
not
that
great
in
my
opinion
i
should
probably
revisit
this
one
someday
and
see
if
my
tastes
have
changed
o
not
bad
at
all
definitely
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
i
like
it
would
buy
again
overall
average
at
best
there
are
better
tripels
out
there
o
this
is
a
solid
tripel
that
is
noticeably
more
bitter
than
most
not
the
best
effort
from
de
dolle
but
still
quite
good
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
but
not
one
of
the
best
if
the
alcohol
was
toned
down
just
a
bit
this
could
be
fantastic
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
notes
intense
and
balanced
if
not
a
little
but
pleasantly
abrasive
pours
a
murky
hazy
yellow
orange
lots
of
nice
white
head
looks
pretty
light
for
a
triple
smells
odd
fuity
light
sweet
tastes
a
touch
raisiny
and
oxidized
sweet
fruits
very
unusual
flavours
very
interesting
taste
highly
carbonted
overall
great
mouthfeel
very
interesting
beer
ogets
better
as
time
goes
on
very
nice
overall
very
unique
for
a
tripel
really
enjoyable
wonderful
drink
serving
type
bottle
o
i
didnt
expect
this
beer
to
be
extremily
drinkable
de
dolle
makes
some
very
interesting
and
peculiar
ales
that
have
strong
and
sometimes
suprising
flavours
i
knew
i
had
to
expect
a
palate
challenging
beer
this
one
though
felt
really
over
the
top
too
prickly
on
the
palate
and
overall
quite
messy
felt
a
little
more
balanced
as
it
warmed
its
quite
good
but
i
cant
say
i
love
it
its
a
bit
too
heavy
and
sweet
but
i
can
see
why
many
people
love
this
one
sampled
from
a
wellaged
bottle
so
the
flavor
profile
might
have
changed
a
bit
overall
a
pleasant
beer
but
didnt
seem
to
follow
the
tripel
style
very
well
significant
caramel
malt
notes
with
some
brown
sugar
background
more
in
keeping
with
a
dubbel
the
only
rival
to
westmalle
as
a
world
class
tripel
while
westmalle
tripel
is
more
supple
and
complex
and
demands
full
attention
in
order
to
be
rewarded
this
is
immediately
hedonistic
loveable
and
delicious
two
different
interpretations
but
both
beautiful
extremes
of
the
same
style
o
a
good
tripel
a
bit
on
the
pricy
side
but
worth
it
flavorful
and
crisp
its
one
of
the
better
tripels
out
there
had
this
on
tap
at
monks
kettle
in
the
mission
district
of
san
francisco
poured
a
medium
honey
color
with
a
light
frothy
head
smells
light
and
airy
almost
as
if
you
could
smell
a
late
summer
barley
harvest
highly
drinkable
hints
of
allspice
and
overall
a
very
good
beer
would
deffinately
order
this
again
o
overall
this
was
spectacular
hands
down
the
favorite
of
the
night
behind
cantillon
on
tap
i
find
it
to
be
quite
similar
to
straffe
hendrik
another
favourite
of
mine
serving
type
draft
the
cpj
feels
very
good
in
the
mouth
good
balance
with
carbonation
leaving
the
feel
of
foam
on
your
lips
a
very
nice
mad
bitch
probably
my
favorite
tripel
that
i
have
had
so
far
noted
the
head
retention
has
remained
excellent
throughout
the
whole
session
dr
high
abv
easy
enough
drinking
but
not
exemplary
quality
high
pricing
by
belgian
standards
this
beer
is
mostly
hype
a
great
tripel
surely
one
of
the
best
in
this
style
you
can
get
from
belgium
the
flavor
has
a
strong
yeast
tropical
fruit
taste
with
a
gentle
raisin
and
subtle
melon
with
hint
of
citrus
rind
and
mild
hop
bitterness
with
mild
herbal
accent
there
is
a
light
sweet
candylike
edge
after
the
hints
of
floral
hops
and
mild
pineapple
from
the
yeast
kicks
in
a
mellow
caramel
date
and
light
dry
pepper
taste
lingers
and
some
alcohol
joins
the
complex
flavor
profile
of
this
tripel
the
amount
of
dried
fruit
flavor
is
pleasant
with
mild
raisiny
sweetness
and
there
is
hints
of
honeyed
banana
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
not
the
best
tripel
since
it
has
some
noticeable
alcohol
but
plenty
of
other
stuff
going
on
to
distract
from
that
i
would
gladly
drink
this
anytime
this
went
very
well
with
my
new
york
scramble
at
brunch
which
had
salmon
egg
and
caramelized
onion
with
parisian
potatoes
an
exceptional
tripel
with
a
truly
interestin
garoma
great
flavour
interesting
and
complex
at
8
a
bottle
its
on
the
expensive
side
but
i
dont
mind
paying
those
prices
for
something
this
good
lots
of
grains
here
with
a
touch
of
yeast
in
the
aroma
light
banana
and
lemon
touches
of
grass
and
even
the
slightest
bit
of
grape
light
and
full
of
flavor
light
notes
of
yeast
and
wheat
some
light
fruit
backed
in
as
well
nice
hints
of
peach
and
a
touch
of
wine
like
alcohol
but
very
light
and
more
of
a
subtle
nice
surprise
then
anything
else
the
flavor
was
good
and
at
times
effortless
the
finish
was
dry
almost
a
champagne
like
dryness
to
it
with
a
long
lasting
flavor
of
grass
or
wet
hay
and
you
just
had
to
go
back
for
another
sip
when
it
was
done
despite
its
10
abv
i
could
easily
have
another
bit
i
wont
one
mad
bitch
in
the
house
is
enough
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
seek
out
d
overall
pretty
good
however
im
not
especially
feeling
the
peppery
emphasis
that
much
but
would
buy
this
again
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
i
had
never
had
this
beer
before
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
isnt
my
favorite
tripel
but
its
a
really
good
one
definitely
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
its
tasty
medium
bodied
plenty
of
carbonation
and
there
is
a
sweet
aftertaste
this
is
a
really
good
tripel
from
de
dolle
i
need
to
seek
this
out
again
some
time
poured
slightly
hazed
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissipates
a
bit
aroma
of
floral
hops
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
of
light
fruits
and
light
sugars
some
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
harshness
from
the
alcohol
moderately
drinkable
good
beer
taste
is
hugely
fruity
and
vinous
loads
of
alcohol
too
big
for
its
own
good
maybe
the
body
is
rich
but
the
malts
light
which
leaves
alcohol
and
yeasty
phenols
picking
up
the
slack
a
little
overcarbonated
but
a
few
hard
swirls
fix
that
pretty
quick
yeast
really
throws
its
weight
around
here
i
dont
know
if
i
have
ever
had
a
fruitier
yeast
driven
beer
before
interesting
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
drinkability
and
overall
impression
if
you
want
two
words
to
describe
this
beer
think
complex
and
balanced
i
found
this
one
dangerously
drinkable
in
that
each
sip
followed
naturally
and
easily
after
the
one
before
it
and
the
temptation
was
to
sip
too
rapidly
for
the
10
abv
i
certainly
would
be
happy
to
have
another
after
the
effects
of
the
well
concealed
alcohol
wear
off
a
bit
in
addition
ill
be
looking
out
to
have
this
one
again
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
a
first
rate
tripel
that
provides
an
example
of
what
a
tripel
should
and
can
be
it
well
deserves
its
high
rankings
super
carbonated

not
bad
has
a
little
age
on
it
again
super
carbonated
version
of
a
tripel
im
used
to
effervescent
co2
but
this
is
literally
hard
to
take
a
sip
without
burping
the
bottling
condition
was
a
bit
out
of
control
from
the
get
go
but
as
it
settles
in
the
glass
it
becomes
much
more
approachable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
i
spoke
about
the
carbonation
issues
a
linger
sweetness
overrides
each
sip
as
well
as
a
kick
of
alcohol
that
doesnt
let
you
forget
who
youre
dealing
with
one
mad
bitch
overall
impression
is
that
this
could
be
world
class
tripel
if
it
had
more
table
manners
but
i
dont
think
de
dolle
or
the
dulle
teve
are
ready
for
that
overall
a
very
goodtasting
beer
with
good
complexity
and
subtlety
jd
carbonation
is
way
too
high
overall
a
pretty
good
tripel
not
a
style
i
find
very
interesting
and
this
did
nothing
to
sway
me
overall
a
great
and
complex
triple
that
relies
greatly
on
the
belgian
yeast
for
its
favor
profile
i
would
definitely
heve
it
again
this
is
a
fantastic
tripelthe
aroma
was
killer
and
the
flavor
was
quite
good
this
is
a
clean
elegant
beer
and
just
kicks
ass
a
wonderful
belgian
tripel
with
loads
of
flavor
compared
to
other
tripels
its
got
great
balance
as
with
everything
ive
had
from
de
dolle
so
far
this
tastes
like
a
beer
that
had
a
great
fermentation
like
stated
earlier
extremely
highly
carbonated
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
belgian
candied
sugar
flavors
abound
d
its
a
sipping
beer
easily
could
pass
a
halfhour
on
one
glass
the
body
is
medium
light
and
carbonation
is
high
but
appropriate
im
definitely
impressed
by
this
beer
the
alcohol
flavor
brings
it
down
though
because
it
is
just
too
prominent
for
a
tripel
m
aggressive
carbonation
light
bodied
like
youre
drinking
alkaseltzer
foam
d
worth
the
price
despite
being
a
bit
out
of
style
i
think
a
very
very
good
beer
with
plenty
to
think
about
not
something
to
pound
but
still
eminently
palatepleasing
there
is
also
a
lingering
yeasty
bread
flavor
that
is
also
slightly
powdery
which
dries
the
tongue
a
bit
interestingly
as
the
beer
warms
the
peppery
alcohol
prominence
goes
from
too
excessive
to
balanced
a
well
made
tripel
indeed
d
the
best
trip
ive
ever
had
hands
down
this
was
worth
the
wait
so
many
years
of
living
from
bottle
to
bottle
and
now
this
big
ups
to
onix1agr
for
making
this
all
happen
d
on
the
pricey
side
but
i
think
i
did
better
than
most
i
really
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
if
it
were
cheaper
this
is
something
i
would
buy
more
often
great
example
of
the
style

a

the

it
took
me
a
while
to
get
one
but
i
am
very
glad
i
did

have
to
pass
this
beer
on
to
some
friends
pours
a
translucent
reddish
orange
with
a
rather
too
large
frothy
head
that
takes
forever
to
die
and
leaves
lace
patches
a
great
aroma
of
some
fruity
esters
that
vary
on
grape
cherry
plush
tropical
fruits
and
a
orangecitric
twang
and
maybe
pear
yeast
aroma
is
prevelant
as
aroma
overall
is
not
too
boozy
and
there
are
some
sweet

and
spicy
notes
in

as
well
a
light
body
with
some
stickiness
yet
still
flows
past
the
tongue
with
ease
a
beer
with
a
touch
of
spicy

a
little

there
is
a
somewhat
vinous
taste
of
apple
pear

grapeskin
with
possible
figs
or
raisins
in
the
beer
has
a
tart
edge
and
is
aided
by
some
citric

flavors

orange
as
well
as
a
strong
carbonation
that
prickles
the
tongue
a
sturdy

base
in
the
backbone
of
the
beer
provides
balance
as
some
caramel
and
bread
malt
peek
out
the
beer
finishes
sharp
and
spicy
due

is
just

should
sip

in
the
taste
quite
hoppy
and
earthy
with
a
dry
to
sweet
fruity
presence
a
hop
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
and
fresh
hop
aftertaste
more
fruit
presence
than
expected
especially
in
the
nose
a
nice
fresh
hop
presence
all
the
way
through
decent
at
best
you
might
want
to
do
a
slow
pour
as
its
foamy
however
once
that
foam
recedes
its
more
than
worth
the
wait
notes
very
spicy
for
a
triple
almost
like
a
massive
saison
really
reminds
me
a
bit
of
avec
les
bons
voeux
from
dupont
would
be
curious
to
see
this
with
4
years
on
it
it
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
with
a
bitter
finish
d
boozy
and
sweet
not
what
i
was
expecting
d
very
easy
drinking
no
aspect
is
too
extreme
i
want
to
go
find
myself
some
bottles
of
this
to
have
on
hand
if
the
draft
list
here
at
the
lions
pride
wasnt
so
impressive
and
full
of
beers
i
want
to
try
i
would
order
myself
a
second
glass
d
dont
need
more
than
one
but
good
danother
phenomenal
beer
from
de
dolle
i
really
dont
what
else
to
say
its
somewhat
sour
bitter
and
has
enough
malt
to
somewhat
tame
this
it
isnt
bad
it
isnt
good
i
have
to
say
ive
had
better
triplels
and
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
them
to
start
with
this
is
the
best
bitch
i
have
ever
encountered
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
yeast
character
is
quite
dominant
with
malt
and
hops
playing
small
but
vital
roles
in
the
overall
experience
the
aroma
is
extremely
phenolic
with
some
clove
but
mostly
it
is
a
series
of
more
unusual
pepper
and
spice
notes
as
well
as
a
slightly
unpleasant
rubbery
tinge
at
the
end
the
flavor
is
equally
spicy
but
with
some
fruit
the
lends
balance
and
makes
things
more
interesting
the
dominant
yeast
characteristics
here
are
pepper
and
mango
which
is
an
oddly
excellent
combination
it
even
works
beautifully
with
the
flavor
of
the
alcohol
as
the
slight
solvent
notes
of
warm
fermentation
echo
the
turpentine
tang
of
pepper
and
mango
due
to
the
powerful
yeast
characteristics
the
malt
is
not
as
noticeable
as
it
is
in
some
examples
of
the
style
but
it
does
help
to
provide
a
smooth
bready
background
for
the
yeast
and
hops
to
act
out
their
roles
overall
this
is
what
i
would
expect
from
de
dolle
it
is
interesting
complex
slightly
flawed
and
utterly
unique
the
aroma
could
be
better
but
the
amazing
flavor
characteristics
more
than
make
up
for
it
this
is
a
beer
that
any
belgian
ale
lover
must
try
amyliz4
gives
it

d
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
tasted
of
the
style
although
i
prefer
the
balance
of

the
alcohol
is
a

high

i
won
this
bottle
in
a
raffle
when
i
attended
the
gals
georgia
ale
lager
sirens
meeting
at
the
brick
store
pub
in
decatur
it
pours
a
hazy
nearly
opaque
honey
golden
with
a
fairly
thick
white
head
be
careful
when
opening
though
the
sample
i
got
fizzed
like
champagne
strong
inviting
aroma
is
fruity
and
a
little
malty
as
well
as
subtly
sweet
rich
flavor
is
mainly
fruity
mostly
apple
with
hints
of
banana
and
pear
there
are
also
malty
and
hoppy
undertones
and
a
little
bitterness
texture
is
smooth
as
soymilk
and
has
a
good
fizz
to
it
definitely
worth
looking
for
but
as
i
said
open
with
caution
poured
in
a
duvel
tulip
massive

nice
golden
color
a
littlebarely
cloudy
and
a
few
yeast
sedimentsstill
a
good
sip
left
with
the
dregs
in
the
bottle
the
smell
is
spicy
and
yeasty
the
taste
very
spicy
lots
of
clean
smooth
malt
subdued
apple
the
mouthfeel
is
good
clean
and
slightly
hot
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
i
could
have
another
easily
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
heavily
carbonated
in
the
mouth
and
finishes
well
mostly
sweet
up
front
again
minimal
breadiness
and
yeast
character
its
really
easy
drinking
especially
for
10
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
the
forward
feel
is
all
pilsner
malt
tastes
like
a
brand
new
beer
really
some
fruitiness
from
the
esters
in
the
midpalate
and
almost
no
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
it
is
perhaps
a
little
too
carbonated
in
the
mouth
but
nothing
is
perfect
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
d
it
was
decent
its
belgian
so
i
had
my
bar
set
high
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
being
a
tripel
i
just
do
not
think
its
remarkable
for
that
style
it
is
a
good
beer
and
was
a
fine
drink
however
i
do
not
ever
seeing
myself
seeking
one
of
these
out
especially
if
there
are
other
tripels
around
i
would
order
it
if
there
werent
much
else
but
if
an
establishment
has
this
then
theyll
at
least
have
chimay
and
their
tripel
is
superior
overall
not
impressed
far
too
carbonated
alcoholic
and
completely
out
of
control
the
bad
alcohol
burn
and
thin
airy
body
made
this
one
a
total
chore
to
drink
the
brew
calmed
down
a
little
after
about
an
hour
in
my
glass
but
there
are
too
many
better
smoother
triples
out
there
to
worry
about
this
one
again
pass
one
of
the
best
triples
i
had
this
one
is
over
a
year
old
and
oh
my
it
is
a
gusher
just
gushes
out
with
a
huge
sedimentfilled
body
this
beer
has
the
most
sediment
ive
ever
had
in
a
beer
the
taste
is
amazing
so
damn
sweet
with
fruits
and
malts
that
ive
never
had
in
a
triple
before
this
is
by
far
the
best
triple
ive
ever
had
first
time
reviewing
it
but
will
buy
this
every
time
i
see
it
amazing
beer
with
a
mouthfeel
that
could
never
be
duplicated
why
is
there
so
much
sediment
though
great
drinkability
pours
a
hugh
hazy
3
finger
head
that
has
a
white
slowly
receding
billowing
head
then
a
nice
off
amber
color
is
revealed
the
smell
is
fruits
dark
fruitsand
some
candied
maltsspicy
yeast
follows
with
a
malt
slight
toffee
smell
the
taste
is
plum
and
melon
with
spice
and
belgian
yeast
it
finishes
slightly
sweet
with
malts
and
toffee
on
the
palate
the
mouth
feel
is
full
it
fill
the
mouth
with
the
above
mentioned
flavors
drinkability
is
a
slow
savor
of
this
brew
let
it
warm
and
taste
the
nuances
it
will
reveal
its
a
great
tripel
that
will
hit
you
when
done
10
its
great
d
a
very
nice
beer
to
review
for
900
a
wonderful
blitz
of
interesting
sweet
malt
and
light
fruit
flavors
coupled
with
spice
and
a
warming
alcohol
presence
i
will
be
revisiting
this
one
again
if
i
can
find
it
in
750s
a
really
nice
version
of
a
tripel
more
malty
than
most
not
to
fruity
nor
too
sweet
it
is
just
right
d
this
is
a
classic
belgian
beer
that
no
other
country
can
emulate
it
encaptulates
everything
great
about
belgian
beers
and
why
they
are
the
best
de
dolle
has
it
going
on
3
for
3
so
far
with
me
very
good
and
unique
take
on
traditional
belgian
styles
note
i
have
opened
many
a
gusher
but
even
with
careful
handling
coming
straight
off
the
storage
rack
this
beer
simply
exploded
unexpectedly
upon
opening
soaking
my
entire
left
side
part
of
the
kitchen
and
two
friends
standing
nearby
the
spray
shot
outward
for

feet
in

leaving
only
about
45
ounces
to
drink
the
rest
on

floor

a

personally
i
like
my
tripels
a

spicier

drier
d
this
is
certainly
a
different
trippel
than
im
used
to
but
it
works
easy
to

would
probably
want
another
if
it
wasnt

outstanding
almost
tannic

time
would
help
this
brew
come
around
still
very
interesting
would
have
been
better
served
with
friends
and
shared
not
sure
even
an
12
oz
bottle
is
for
just
1
person
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
hot
zesty
and
mouthfilling
carbonation
the
overall
sweetness
what
with
the
malts
and
candy
sugars
combined
with
the
high
abv
would
keep
this
one
in
my
special
occasion
category
not
that
multiples
couldnt
be
consumed
its
just
more
special
than
that
i
tried
mad
bitch
at
a
local
bar
in
newtown
pa
the
place
was
nice
but
i
cant
recall
the
name
of
it
they
had
a
tasting
of
spaten
and
i
think
i
say
the
ad
on
this
site
i
admitt
the
beer
was
purchased
for
name
sake
only
but
that
beer
was
very
good
the
high
achohol
content
is
why
i
cant
write
anymore
about
it
another
great
beer
from
by
the
bottle
in
vancouver
wa
this
pours
a
glowing
golden
and
has
a
silky
tan
head
with
good
lace
the
nose
is
very
fruity
and
has
some
nice
candy
malts
there
is
also
some
spicy
hops
and
herby
belgian
yeasts
this
has
a
delicious
malt
structure
with
candy
bready
sugars
and
tropical
fruits
perfectly
balanced
by
the
hops
and
yeasts
full
body
fits
the
brew
nicely
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
prominence
of
the
alcohol
and
the
disheartening
sight
of
a
glass
of
beer
with
absolutely
no
head
and
no
lacing
it
just
looked
dead
in
the
glass
from
other
reviews
of
this
it
is
clear
that
a
lot
of
people
have
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
but
it
was
certainly
a
disappointment
for
me

will
sneak
up
on
you
at
10
a
couple
of
days
after
this
review
i
had
a
bottle
of
the
1994
vintage
first
year
at
de

it
was
incredible
less
sugary
more
fruitiness
and
spicy
tanginess

something
that
gets
better
with
age

mouthfeel
is
very
nice

to
nice
juicy
fruitiness

flavor
finishing
with
hop
bitterness
and
spiciness
which
lasts
for
a
while
alcohol
not
readily
apparent
but
really
warming
on
finish
i
have
just
had
my
tastiest
triple
to
date
i
absolutley
cannot
wait
to
try
another
brew
by
this
brewery
this
may
be
my
favorite
belgian
tripel
hands
down
its
incredibly
wellbalanced
and
the
flavors
are
unique
to
this
brew
while
being
grounded
in
the
style
tradition
great
great
great
brew
an
intense
interesting
warming
sipper
my
educated
guess
is
that
it
would
do
well
with
some
hearty
food
pork
taste
mouthfeel
tons
of
esters
and
phenols
on
display
here
but
with
a
greater
hop
presence
to
balance
them
banana
apple
and
lemon
with
an
earthy
bitterness
underneath
sweetness
is
moderate
but
it
dries
up
quickly
in
the
finish
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
carbonation
is
high
almost
champagnelike
pours
cloudy
orange
gold
with
a
huge
foamy
head
aroma
of
yeast
geass
citrus
light
fruits
and
spice
tastes
much
the
same
with
a
vineous
quality
that
shines
through
at
the
end
finishes
very
smooth
with
a
warming
alcohol
excellent
beer

of
my
favorite
tripels

my
dfh

color
similar
to

some
light

scents
of

and
a

tartness
in
the
back
of
the

some
complexity
in

i
still
cant
quite
tease
out
the

there
is
a
really
nice

between
the
fruit

candy
sugar
honey
and
alcohol
character
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
warming
and
pretty
smooth
considering
the
head
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
a
tripel
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
the
harmony
of
flavors
makes
this
a
really
pleasant
brew
to
sit
back
and
savor
the
smell
so
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
fruits
to
it
and
it
has
a
tartness
to
it
the
beer
has
a
big
bite
from
the
carbonation
and
has
a
sweat
wheat
taste
to
it
the
complexity
of
the
beer
makes
it
quite
difficult
to
taste
everything
the
alcohol
is
also
quite
prevalent
the
flavours
include
some
sweet
apples
flavour
to
a
slight
banana
taste
from
the
wheat
however
a
hint
of
tartness
is
there
right
before
the
alcohol
hits
the
feel
is
creamy
and
carbonated
the
beer
tastes
good
but
its
not
something
id
want
again
finish
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
is
incredibly
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
ale
this
is
an
incredibly
interesting
beer
with
loads
of
taste
worth
a
try
for
sure
mad
bitch
is
a
real
good
tripel
it
has
a
bit
more
peppery
spice
and
alcohol
im
used
to
in
a
tripel
but
they
only
serve
to
add
to
the
enjoyment
drinkability
this
is
one
that
you
want
to
keep
sipping
and
are
sad
when
its
gone
the
alcohol
will
keep
you
in
check
but
another
bottle
will
cure
the
sadness
of
finishing
the
first
the
feel
was
crisp
and
refreshing
it
is
a
great
triple
definitely
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
few
of
these
after
a
long
week
drinkability
this
is
one
great
tripel
i
personally
am
a
big
fan
of
triples
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
so
far
i
could
see
myself
knocking
back
a
few
in
a
sitting
on
the
whole
a
delicious
brew
still
i
dont
see
myself
spending
the
money
to
pick
up
another
bottle
i
cant
imagine
aging
this
beer
would
do
anything
except
make
it
syrupy
and
even
sweeter
which
in
my
eyes
wouldnt
be
a
desirable
thing
a
solid
offering
though
ill
still
take
westmalles
tripel
above
all
else
if
given
the
option
poured
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
because
every
de
dolle
beer
i
pour
into
my
oerbier
glass
goes
everywhere
the
head
on
these
beers
is
insane
and
even
the
most
gentle
pour
is
a
challenge
with
keeping
the
head
in
the
glass
opaque
amber
brew
with
a
head
the
went
to
the
absolute
top
of
the
glass
the
head
wouldnt
go
down
fast
enough
in
my
eagerness
to
enjoy
this
rare
jewel
for
me
moderate
lacing
on
the
glass
with
a
low
encapsulating
head
around
the
amber
brew
smell
is
easily
the
best
ive
had
to
date
especially
for
the
tripels
very
sweet
and
very
de
dolle
that
same
distinctive
yeast
they
use
in
seemingly
all
of
their
beer
at
a
loss
for
words
intoxicating
aroma
that
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
want
to
finish
the
drink
taste
isnt
to
disappoint
crisp
and
sweet
with
obvious
candy
sugars
easy
on
the
tongue
and
very
drinkable
yum
slender
belgian
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
but
probably
a
year
or
so
old
allmalt
with
white
candy
sugar
in
the
kettle
the
beer
is
goldenorange
with
a
few
dregs
medium
carbonation
and
three
inches
of
white
head
that
leaves
lace
and
clumps
of
foam
on
the
glass
fruity
and
spicy
in
the
nose
with
pineapple
peach
apple
citrus
and
doughy
yeast
very
nice
strong
flavors
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
candy
sweetness
red
and
green
apples
and
a
light
dosage
of
green
hops
on
top
of
a
tingly
and
dry
almost
full
body
a
very
nice
ale
fruity
and
spicy
another
winner
from
the
mad
brewers
drinkability
quite
impressive
but
the
cacophany
of
flavors
is
not
something
i
would
want
everyday
drinkability
is
incredible
given
the
alcohol
content
i
could
drink
this
all
night
boot
and
rally
wow
tastes
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
yeasty
and
spices
on
the
front
lines
backed
up
by
a
complex
fruitiness
and
malts
i
did
even
know
this
was
over
7
until
i
looked
it
up
on
ba
great
beer
d
age
did
nice
things
for
this
beer
among
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
not
too
intense
but
exciting
this
beer
is
one
to
enjoy
at
a
comfortable
pace
pours
a
lightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
that
fades
slowly
to
spotty
lacing
patterns
visibly
effervescent
with
suspended
bits
the
smell
is
nice
full
nose
of
earthy
belgian
yeast
sweet
with
notes
of
orchard
fruits
i
think
the
aggressive
nature
is
partly
from
the
alcohol
which
is
quite
enjoyable
the
mouth
feel
is
lmedium
bodied
effervescent
and
creamy
full
flavored
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
and
is
complemented
well
by
the
texture
quite
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
wonderful
lingering
aftertaste
the
10
abv
is
integrated
well
into
the
nose
and
mouth
yet
reveals
itself
in
a
warming
swallow
a
very
easy
drinker
highly
recommended
copped
a
750
ml
bottle
from
wine
and
beverage
depot
in
totowa
darkgreen
bottle
with
a
purple
and
yellow
logo
sticker
with
a
pissedoff
woman
with
the
phrase
mad
bitch
on
the
top
right
corner
corked
bottle
that
when
popped
unleashes
a
strong
whiff
of
alcohol
coupled
with
a
pear
and
fruit
aroma
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
heavily
alcoholic
with
esters
fruits
citrus
and
a
floral
taste
candied
sweet
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
tongue
long
after
the
first
sip
definitely
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
over
a
long
period
of
time
the
10
abv
is
certainly
noticeable
and
makes
its
presence
known
with
a
warming
alcohol
glow
taste
is
very
multidimensional
and
complex
with
deep
rich
flavors
pouring
through
slight
sediment
visible
and
the
mouthfeel
was
good
although
the
strong
alcoholic
notes
compromise
the
drinkability
the
beer
possesses
a
very
champagnelike
quality
and
with
carbonation
present
i
would
consider
this
one
a
sipper
overall
really
good
stuff
a
strong
depiction
of
the
style
a
powerful
tripel
that
packs
a
punch
recommended
lively
bubbles
oily
in
tongue
taste
is
acid
apples
peaches
flowers
and
the
chocolate
background
it
seems
to
me
kind
of
a
mix
between
a
white
and
an
abbey
beer
from
bottle
at
the
trappist
in
oakland
high
carbonation
excellent
head
very
ripe
fruit
flavors
especially
tangerine
nice
bready
doughy
notes
in
the
aroma
extremely
low
hop
flavor
and
aroma
as
you
might
expect
nice
and
dry
but
not
bone
dry
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
virtually
opaque
but
without
lots
of
yeasties
floating
around
smells
of
tangy
belgian
yeast
with
pronounced
aromas
of
bananas
clove
and
spice
the
taste
is
wonderful
flavors
of
apricot
candi
sugar
clove
black
pepper
juniper
come
together
seamlessly
there
is
a
nice
finish
of
spice
and
bright
slightly
spicy
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
long
and
attenuated
very
little
sweetness
on
the
finish
absolutely
delicious
ontap
and
one
of
the
better
tripels
out
there
a
total
treat
but
the
high
abv
keeps
it
from
being
super
drinkable
but
man
this
is
a
fantastic
tripel
ill
be
coming
back
for
more
some
time
in
the
near
future
i
know
drinkability
decptively
high
i
wouldnt
know
i
was
getting
totalled
on
this
10
monster
until
the
damage
had
been
done
there
is
alcohol
on
the
mouthfeel
but
not
to
the
point
that
it
would
be
percived
as
a
big
beer
beautiful
tripel
hazy
bubbly
orange
with
a
foamy
dense
head
nose
is
tart
apples
sharp
and
biting
with
sugary
spices
taste
is
heavy
on
the
alcohol
it
kicks
in
early
and
stays
strong
strong
sweetness
comes
through
and
yeast
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
it
swims
heavily
through
your
mouth
drinkability
is
hampered
a
bit
from
the
abv
and
lingering
alcohol
flavors
still
a
great
beer
but
alcohol
hurts
it
drinkability
couldnt
handle
the
alcohol
flavor
i
love
big
beers
but
this
one
doesnt
hide
the
alcohol
at
all
drinkability
on
this
beer
was
a
mixed
bag
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavors
and
aromas
but
i
found
the
alcohol
to
be
a
bit
overwhelming
sample
at
firewaters
in
atlantic
city
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
medium
rocky
white
head
that
lasts
the
whole
small
glass
large
patches
of
lacing
the
aroma

of
yeast
citrus
and
different
spices
medium

with
sweet

flavors
along
with
touches
of
hops
and
alcohol
nice
fruity
undertones
as
well
the
finish
is
both
fruity
and
spicy
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
tripel

on
the

a

quite
a

on
the
tongue
tremendously
light

and
well
attenuated

not

at
all
combine
this
with
dry

leaves
you
with
a
brew
that
can
sneak
up
you
highly
recommended
overall
an
outstanding
belgian
tripel
a
nice
way
to
celebrate
my
400th
review
recommended
d
great
aroma
and
a
very
nice
taste
that
is
well
balanced
with
some
soft
sweetness
and
a
light
bitterness
despite
being
10
this
is
quite
drinkable
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
but
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
tasty
yet
rich
enough
to
help
you
keep
the
speed
in
check
and
lacking
the
digestibility
i
look
for
in
the
style
honestly
id
have
guessed
this
was
from
the
u
s
in
blind
tasting
its
best
attribute
is
that
while
heavy
tasting
doesnt
drink
at
10
edit
upon
further
drinking
the
beer
im
finding
myself
enjoying
the
drink
a
bit
more
the
taste
still
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
is
still
drinkable
great
beer
will
visit
again
if
you
are
into
aging
beers
this
is
a
winner
alcohol
was
hidden
quite
well
hey
this
is
my
first
beer
reivew
so
it
goes
purchased
at
the
bacchus
cornelius
beer
shop
in
bruges
7
weeks
ago
and
opened
with
trepidation
this
tripel
poors
a
white
perfumy
head
that
looks
identical
to
the
proseco
my
wife
has
just
opened
viewed
in
my
new
oerbier
tulip
glass
the
look
is
reminiscent
of
some
hot
apple
cider
i
had
in
minnesota
one
fall
aroma
is
slightly
spiced
but
disappointingly
underwhelming
taste
however
is
magical
taste
at
first
resiny
evaporates
into
the
tonsils
leaving
an
apricot
and
corinander
flourish
i
doubt
you
can
buy
this
in
the
statesthats
why
i
bought
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
biting
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
good
i
bought
my
bottle
several
months
ago
and
it
took
me
forever
to
get
around
to
it
because
i
was
a
little
sick
of
tripels
at
the
time
im
glad
i
waited
until
now
because
i
think
i
enjoyed
more
now
than
i
would
have
when
i
purchased
it
d
i
think
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
not
a
beer
i
could
stick
with
all
night
sessionability
is
once
again
low
due
to
high
alcohol
content
and
complexity
of
flavours
which
ought
to
be
enjoyed
thoroughly
and
slowly
marvelous
ive
had
about
half
of
it
and
im
surprised
by
how
the
hotness
and
the
spice
are
balanced
by
that
smooth
creamy
malt
backbone
well
worth
trying
truthfully
i
found
this
to
be
a
little
too
aggressive
for
the
style
while
most
tripels
weigh
in
at
9
or
10
i
simply
found
this
one
to
posses
less
grace
and
be
a
tad
harsh
on
the
palate
this
wouldnt
be
one
of
my
top
choices
for
the
style
i
will
say
though
this
is
merely
my
own
personal
taste
and
with
all
considered
dulle
teve
is
still
a
pretty
nice
beer
good
body
and
depth
of
complexity
and
flavor
really
nice
balance
overall
not
a
dropdead
world
class
tripel
but
an
outstanding
ale
of
high
quality
full
flavor
and
a
lot
of
wellconcealed
alcohol
content
enjoy
responsibly
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
mad
ladies
in
one
night
but
you
kinda
have
to
pace
yourself
this
is
a
true
sipping
beer
enjoy
complex
in
many
ways
pours
a
very
cloudy
golden
hue
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
tripel
with
a
full
body
reminds
me
a
little
of
the
unibroue
15
with
its
sweeter
character
i
enjoyed
this
all
the
way
through
and
the
abv
does
not
detract
de
dolle
has
always
been
interesting
to
me
if
somewhat
erratic
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
one
to
fans
of
the
style
the
distinctive
de
dolle
funk
is
more
pronounced
but
it
seems
like
the
alcohol
has
almost
completely
taken
over
which
is
interesting
usually
the
alcohol
mellows
out
with
age
this
beer
is
definitely
better
when
its
fresher
drinkability
not
that
great
could
be
because
i
just
had
an
oerbier
and
it
was
soo
much
better
a
bit
full
bodied
for
a
tripel
but
more
complexity
too
wellbalanced
not
my
favorite
offering
from
the
dolle
brewers
but
still
a
complex
and
tasty
ale
strange
and
wonderful
good
god
no
lack
of
flavor
found
here
the
first
tastes
are
a
vodkaesque
alcohol
note
with
citrus
and
wheat
more
mellow
hops
and
spice
notes
finish
and
get
better
as
it
warms
give
this
thing
a
while
to
sit
as
the
mouthfeel
is
offensive
at
first
after
a
good
effervescing
the
beer
was
much
smoother
and
more
drinkable
call
it
an
interesting
beer
and
a
lively
tripel
itll
definately
get
your
attention
on
the
first
taste
although
it
can
be
a
bit
too
intenseunbalanced
to
be
considered
overly
drinkable
others
have
spoken
of
yeast
cakes
and
multiple
floaties
from
this
brew
none
were
observed
with
this
bottle
mike
at
hitimes
cellars
said
that
it
had
just
arrived
so
this
may
just
be
a
very
fresh
sample
very
drinkable
very
tasty
just
a
little
syrupy
sweet
and
thick
to
drink
all
the
time
pours
a
four
finger
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to

spirits
acton
ma
certainly
a
decent
tripel
but
to
be
honest
allagash
is
cheaper
and
tops
this
easily
the
mad
bitch
is
still
quite
respectable
but
could
use
a
little
less
sweetness
and
complexity
for
my
liking
into
a
chalice
pours
a

of

thats
settles
down
to
a
spattering
of
foam
nice
lacing
too
bad
its
an
aweful
color
cause
its
otherwise
a
very
pretty
beer
aroma
is
delicious
a
very
very
fruity
triple
apricots
and
peaches
plums
and
pears
spices
like
corriander
and
cloves
lovely
taste
has
the
same
bunch
of
of
delicious
fruits
belgian
sugars
a
herbal
hop
streak
through
the
middle
yeasty
the
alcohol
warming
nicely
the
body
is
fantastic
the
whole
ride
is
just
great
really
this
is
just
a
great
beer
i
just
wish
it
were
cheaper
good
thing
i
have
several
more
from
these
crazy
brewers
this
poured
with
a
huge
billowing
bigbubbled
head
which
faded
quickly
to
a
dense
coating
it
was
a
cloudy
golden
tan
color
the
aroma
was
wonderful
it
had
a
coy
belgian
aroma
slightly
fruity
enticingly
mild
the
flavor
was
surprisingly
bitter
between
the
bitterness
and
the
carbonation
there
was
a
nice
bite
there
were
flavors
of
oak
bread
raspberries
strawberries
citrus
pine
and
dare
i
say
peanut
the
bitterness
lasted
long
into
the
finish
there
was
a
strong
alcohol
burn
as
it
warmed
the
flavor
mellowed
a
bit
but
the
bite
was
still
there
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
example
of
a
beer
im
particularly
fond
of
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
i
like
it
drinkability
awesome
tripel
but
the
alcohol
levels
drop
this
score
down
a
bit
find
this
one
and
enjoy
it
its
great
on
tap
not
your
standard
tripel
but
very
enjoyable
recommended
i
love
this
tripel
and
i
love
this
brewery
they
rarely
disappoint
and
this
is
no
exception
perfect
balance
with
the
malt
and
yeasty
flavors
make
this
incredibly
complex
and
worth
seeking
out
highly
recommended
now
if
i
could
just
find
another
bottle
of
the
dulle
teve
reserva
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
high
it
envelops
the
palate
like
a
sweet
nectar
and
encourages
sipping
one
11
2
oz
bottle
is
good
be
sure
to
share
a
750
or
you
might
wind
up
on
the
floor
the
beer
was
in
a
small
capped
not
corked
bottle
the
smell
was
pleasant
with
a
fruity
hint
of
possibly
apple
the
beer
was
cloudy
and
golden
although
not
usually
a
fan
of
triples
this
beer
was
an
exception
the
taste
was
smooth
and
crisp
the
carbonation
was
slightly
strong
but
enjoyable
this
mad
bitch
made
me
respect
triples
again
quite
yummy
on
the
palate
initial
flavors
of
spiced
banana
bread
warm
my
mouth
followed
by
a
feint
mineral
taste
and
some
yeast
finishing
with
a
little
alcohol
somewhat
on
the
dry
side
and
scrubbing
on
the
tongue
very
delicious
and
punchy
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
mildly
sweet
and
addictive
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
are
aggressive
at
first
but
turn
to
a
smoothness
that
delivers
nicely
a
very
good
tripel
in
my
opinion
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
with
stuffed
shells
which
is
just
an
ok
match
it
brings
out
more
of
the
sweetness
in
this
beer
unfortunately
the
dryness
in
triples
are
what
i
love
get
this
beer
overall
a
very
good
tripel
but
not
my
favorite
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
might
buy
it
again
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
drinkabilityoverall
an
impressive
tripel
overall
fruity
spicy
dry
hits
all
the
bases
and
remains
balanced
despite
a
substantial
booze
presence
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
drinkability
big
sweetness
wears
a
little
but
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
tripel
thanks
to
orfeu
for
the
bottle
drinkability
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
balance
d
this
is
delicious
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
its
the
best
triple
ive
ever
had
never
had
a
triple
with
this
much
depth
great
stuff
d
well
it
is
really
strong
but
if
i
could
get
more
at
this
price
i
would
buy
it
by
the
sixer
overall
a
balanced
and
interesting
beer
highly
recommended
i
would
drink
this
often
if
it
was
readily
available
overall
a
good
tripel
but
nothing
great
cheers
pours
a
super
heady
and
foamy
light
cloudy
amber
color
aromas
are
very
estery
some
bubblegum
citrus
and
hints
of
coriander
fermentation
temps
must
have
been
through
the
roof
flavor
is
huge
lots
of
body
spice
sugary
sweetness
and
bready
yeast
warming
alcohol
hits
you
in
the
end
this
is
a
pretty
amazing
tripel
perhaps
in
my
top
5
would
improve
had
i
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
more
but
this
is
a
special
treat
and
im
glad
i
finally
tried
it
clear
amber
color

white

grains
and
citrus

sour
red
fruit
and
citrus

cream
raw
body
and
dry
style

aftertaste
slightly
bitter
chalk
and
yeast
i
was
excited
to
see
another
small
belgian
brewery
to
make
a
tripel
as
st
bernardus
is
my
favorite
but
this
never
seems
to
develop
into
anything
worthwhile
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
dissipates
quickly
unlike
most
tripels
there
is
not
a
lot
of
effervescing
going
on
in
the
glass
after
this
beer
is
poured
there
seems
to
be
too
much
carbonation
which
never
lets
the
spices
or
malt
develop
the
aftertaste
is
citruslike
but
again
it
dissipates
quickly
overall
this
is
a
middlegrade
tripel
the
flavors
are
good
the
appearance
is
pleasing
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
recommended
but
not
as
highly
as
others
of
its
style
d
give
me
another
baby
this
mad
bitch
is
always
a
welcome
companion
to
me
drinkability
is
good
a
fine
tripel
and
an
enjoyable
beer
want
to
thank
babydoc
and
bcg
bif
for
this
beer
very
interesting
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
i
very
much
wanted
another
one
super
drinkable
for
the
strength
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
tripples
but
i
love
the
mad
brewers
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
tripples
ive
had
period
may
not
be
yeasty
enough
for
some
a
sweet
tasty
ale
that
truly
that
is
great
after
a
meal
pours
with
a
very
thick
head
and
a
cloudy
amber
color
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
sweetness
with
subtle
overtones
of
fruit
hidden
in
there
somewhere
along
with
a
dash
of
hops
it
is
quite
effervescent
which
is
typical
of
the
belgian
style
very
satisfying
d
incredibly
drinkable
for
the
strength
bold
approach
to
a
tripel
which
works
out
very
well
indeed
drinkability
this
flavor
hits
home
as
more
of
a
saison
than
a
tripel
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
no
matter
what
style
period
if
it
had
a
bit
more
sweetness
like
most
tripels
this
one
would
be
off
the
chart
terrific
brew
and
highly
recommended
notes
pretty
kick
ass
brew
and
although
not
a
rare
beer
i
havent
seen
it
around
until
my
latest
trip
to
the
wine
house
just
off
the
405
freeway
seems
to
be
getting
a
nice
stock
of
some
harder
to
find
brews
i
would
buy
this
more
often
and
im
sure
its
priced
fairly
but
at
6
bucks
a
330ml
it
is
a
once
in
a
blue
moon
type
brew
it
has
an
attractive
orangekopper
appearance
and
bubbly
head
i
ranked
the
syrupy
smell
pretty
low
but
just
because
it
is
about
the
same
as
most
belgians
which
is
still
pretty
good
the
taste
is
what
i
thought
was
the
most
outstanding
aspect
of
this
beer
it
has
a
long
drawn
out
after
taste
that
is
all
over
the
place
from
heavy
belgian
syrup
to
a
whole
array
of
fruity
flavors
but
it
stayed
relativly
dry
and
didnt
get
too
sweet
this
is
a
pretty
heavy
and
expensive
beer
so
it
didnt
get
the
best
drinkability
from
me
but
this
is
more
than
a
worth
a
try
from
the
bottle
poured
acloudy
copper
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
large
fluffy
white
head
and
a
ton
of
lacing

spicey
coriander
gloves
lemon
orange

some

cinnamon

bready

as
it
warms
alcohol
came
out
nicely
good
beer
taste
was
different
no
sign
of
the
oxidation
if
there
was
any
at
all
and
the
iron
taste
was
not
present
first
impression
was
good
an
alcoholic
firm
beer
with
higher
alcohols
ripe
bananas
and
a
bitter
dry
aftertaste
there
is
also
some
acidity
in
the
aftertaste
but
that
is
really
in
the
back
second
impression
was
that
the
beer
is
more
or
less
out
of
balance
there
is
too
much
alcohol
to
really
be
drinkable
so
i
cannot
rate
this
as
high
as
my
colleague
reviewers
too
bad
because
i
had
high
expectations
from
the
dolle
brouwers
let
this
one
warm
up
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
solid
example
better
than
most
tripels
but
a
tad
expensive
i
got
this
330ml

this
does
taste
good
though
the
after
taste
makes
me
feel
like
i
burped
up
this
mornings
total
raisin
bran
notes
the
phenols
in
this
beer
are
quite
strong
the
intensity
of
the
flavor
is
a
semidistant
2nd
place
when
compared
to
de

quite
good
alcohol
is
quite
strong
so
this
is
a
slow
sipper
definitely
warms
you
up
on
a
cold
night
i
wish
this
beer
had
a
little
more
balance
between
the
flavors
from
the
yeast
and
the
malt
a
mad
bitch
she
is
but
mighty
fine
the

is
noticeable
but
doesnt
overpower
the
complexities
of
this

over
the
top
on
all
counts
and
not
very
balanced
in
my
opinion
nonetheless
thanks
to
biglove
for
the
opportunity
the
mouth
is
full
and
the
alcohol
component
threatens
to
make
it
rough
but
it
all
works
out
in
the
end
this
is
in
no
way
a
session
beer
maybe
two
bottles
maybe
the
real
beauty
of
this
beer
is
not
only
is
it
big
bold
and
all
up
in
your
face
but
there
is
so
much
complexity
going
on
here
overall
damn
i
didnt
even
realize
it
was
10
no
wonder
i
was
a
little
bit
more
dehydrated
than
i
shouldve
been
sunday
morning
definitely

wouldve
liked
to
know
the
name
meant
dam
bitch
at
the
time
drinkability
this
beer
is
potent
and
tasty
unique
flavors
are
very
impressive
and
the
beer
is
a
nice
warmer
on
a
cool
winter
evening
well
rounded
and
impressively
spicy
i
like
my
belgian
tripels
a
little
drier
and
with
more
zesty
hop
flavor
and
pronounced
bitterness
in
balance
where
this
one
resides
a
bit
more
on
the
belgian
strong
golden
ale
side
it
doesnt
finish
as
rich
as
those
either
making
this
a
great
choice
for
those
of
tripels

harsh
and
to
be
avoided
in
the

this
was
very
drinkable
which
is
dangerous
given
the
amount
of

i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
one
of
the
tastiest
tripels
i
have
had
if
belgian
tripels
exploding
with
alcoholic
flavor
is
your
favorite
category
this

is
a
must

is

staying

mouthfeel
is
ok
but
alcohol
and
carbonation
are
imo
far
too
high
this
hurts
drinkability
also
enormous
id
stick
with
the
st

bottle
probably
shouldnt
have
tasted
this
straight
after
the
oerbier

a
massive

looked
spectacular

by
the
warm

the

honey

with
some
notes
of
floral
malt
and
light
funky
yeast
this
is
not
bad
but
was
expecting
a
bit
more
character
and
im
wondering
if
something
was
not
wrong
with
this
bottle
will
have
to
rerate
that
one
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
superbly
creamy
and
delicious
fine
carbonation
which
fills
the
mouth
and
tickles
the
tonsils

absolutely
fabulous
flavor
and

peppery

developing
into

and
finishing
quite
dry
and

very
refreshing
with
a
long
and
tart
finish
alcohol
very
well
integrated
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
sampled
last
weekend
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
the
beer
poured
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
2
fingers
of
head
that
sits
fluffy
over
the
beer
the
nose
was
somewhat
apple
sweet
but
with
a
bit
of
sourness
and
a
slight
acidic
tone
as
well
the
flavor
was
so
nice
on
this
the
initial
sour
and
tart
flacors
meld
together
with
the
fruity
tones
to
make
this
one
finish
sometwhat
like
a
sweettart
candy
nice
the
feel
was
moderate
slightly
creamy
with
a
healthy
bit
of
bubble
solid
beer
i
could
easily
have
drank
this
beer
all
night
but
why
when
there
were
so
many
other
choices
poured
from
a
corked
750ml
bottle
this
is
a
hazy
honey
color
with
a
gigantic
head
yeasties
are
all
around
my
beer
as
i
have
noticed
with
other

brews

of

backed
up
by

very

backed
by
a
very

somewhat
bicuity
the
finish
is
loaded
with
bittering
hops
and
dries
up
the
mouth
nicely
great
mouthfeel
full
yet
fluffy
almost
leaving
my
tongue
numb
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as

by

a

to
the
followup
a
soothing
offering
overall
lush
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
limited
by
its
abv
and
to
be
honest
its
a
somewhat
tough
profile
to
get
my
arms
around
to
want
to
drink
this
more
than
once
in
a
while
i
really
like
it

want
to
save
it

never
tired
of
this
one
and
kept
lamenting
that

had
less
and

an

why
did
i
buy
only
one

seek

of

i
cant

its
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
once
again
thanks
to

br
a
750ml
sample
showed
a
lot
of
difference
here
the
yeast
was
very
dominating
musty
while
the
malt
was
particularly
candylike
spicy
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
but
extreme
level
of
yeastiness
was
perhaps
too
much
not
changing
the
score
this
beer
is

at

store
to
find
with
some
digging
older
bottles
with
lower
prices
from
days
gone
by
stuck
in
back
of
the
newer
product
this
comes
in

you
are

an

or
just
a
lower
price
digging
into
the
very
back
of
the
dulle
teve
row
in
the
cooler
i
happened
across
a
partially
moldy
bottle
that
was
2
less
than
the
front
ones
bingo
had
it
been
there
for
months
years
no
dates
on
the
bottle
after
cleaning
some
black
crud
from
around
the
cap
i
poured
the
nectar
inside
into
my
duvel
tulip
the
beer
was
a
hazedcloudy
vibrant
goldenyelloworange
color
and
was
topped
by
a
billowing
tower
of
offwhite
head
which
slowly
settled
down
into
a
nice
hilly
blanket
form
the
nose
was
wonderful
with
notes
of
fresh
sweettart
granny
smith
apples
intermingled
with
aromas
of
pineapple
citrus
zest
stalks
of
lemongrass
and
ancient
mustiness
this
was
liberally
accented
with
smooth
coriander
and
a
spicy
hops
the
moldy
exterior
was
not
detrimental
to
its
taste
either
i
experienced
potent
honeymeadlike
malts
that
warmed
the
throat
while
releasing
excellent
gewurtztraminnergrape
flavors
and
notes
of
pineapple
and
cinnamonclovemusty
spices
the
finish
presented
a
nice
pop
of
spiced
dessert
wine
flavors
and
an
excellent
spicy
bitter
hoppiness
alcohol
was
evident
here
but
it
melded
perfectly
with
the
flavors
throughout
the
body
was
creamy
smooth
silky
and
a
bit
fluffy
working
extremely
well
for
the
flavors
and
character
of
the
beer
this
tripel
was
a
vibrant
delicous
and
masterfully
balanced
flavor
monster
this
mad
bitch
is
quite
loveable
despite
being
a
little
unattractive
on
the
outside
pitch
the
yeast
if
you
will
i
encourage
you
to
do
so
throwing
her
that
food
will
bring
back
a
bit
of
the
sweet
fruitiness
you
loved
to
begin
with
but
dont
mistake
her
true
nature
she
is
mad
and
at
10
abv
shes
got
the
equipment
to
do
something
about
it
beware
not
too
drinkable
with
this
harshness
maybe
a
bad
bottle
resembles
a
volcano
with
its
pendulous
white
peak
shallow
caldera

underlying

is
less
citrusy
than
other
tripels
but
quite
tasty
grainy
malts
lead
here
followed
by
some
medium
acidity
in
the
finish
and
very
late
bitterness
some
orange
flavor
does
come
through
after
a
few
ounces
nice
stuff
75
cl
capped
bottle
no
freshness
dating
and
the
bottle
seems
to
be
rather
old
because
the
cap
and
underside
lip
have
some
powdery
mildew
on
it
the
bottle
didnt
seem
as
full
as
other
75
centiliters
so
i
think
excessive
carbonation
in
storage
forced
some
out
hence
the
mildew
opened
with
a
loud
hiss
so
it
seems
were
good
to
go

my
lord
its
strong
i
think
i
just
felt
the
mad
bitch
pimpslap
me
and
demanded
to
know
where
her
moneys
at
i
think
i
got
a
bottle
that
had
been
jarred
around
too
much
during
transport
the
carbonation
was
fair
not
explosive
like
ive
noticed
in
other
reviews
this
only
affected
the
mouthfeel
because
a
higher
carbonation
level
would
have
cut
the
solventlike
alcohol
burn
a
little
better
ill
just
have
to
be
more
careful
in
inspecting
bottles
before
purchase
in
the
future
immense
multilayered

frothy
large
bubbles
at
the
base
and
fine

top
lasted
for
ever
leaving

throughout
my
sampling
this
beer
retained
a
small

first
nose
was
of

hoppiness
followed
by

of
apricot

initial
sip
reveals
apricot
sweetness

followed
by
a
wonderful
warmness
overtime
i
picked
up
spice
perhaps
clove
white
pepper
i
also
noticed
a
fleeting
smokiness
a
fairly
thick
viscous
beer
helped
to
feal
lighter
by
the
the
consistent
presence
of
fine
carbonation
finish
was
long
with
a
pronounced
hop
as
tripels
go
very
decent
however
in
my
opinion
the
alcohol
seemed
a
bit
out
of
balance

a

growning
a

carbonated

it

just
to
pour
the

there
is

and
lots

the

is
pretty
good
for
a
10
brew
as
well
a
nice
tripel
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
the
flavor
is
ok
with
the
ribs
and
that
is
quite
a
challenge
the
tartness
competes
with
the
flavor
of
the
meat
the
medium
body
it
works
thanks
to
the
family
for
continuing
to
brew
drinkability
is
very
good
classic
trippel
imho
very
spicy
and
alcholic
very
tasty
as
it
warms
this
was
a
very
tasty
offering
this
week
at
anam
cara
the
pour
was
a
cloudy
goldenrod
topped
with
a
frothy
head
that
was
reminiscent
of
whipped
egg
whites
the
head
died
down
a
bit
but
still
stayed
with
me
as
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
found
the
aroma
spicey
but
muted
which
i
liked
taste
is
also
a
bit
spicey
with
top
citrus
notes
i
thought
the
beer
had
great
full
mouthfeel
with
some
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
wellmade
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
new
it
was
a
big
beer
and
it
hid
that
almost
perfectly
would
get
one
again
but
only
one
at
a
time
a
mild
astringent
medicinal
flavor
enters
as
it
warms
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
just
a
great
complex
beer
certainly
not
for
the
weak
of
palate
very
lively
and
highly
enjoyable
a
strong
and
flavorfully
potent
trippel
i
enjoyed
this
one
damn
good
with
a
name
like
the
mad
bitch
this
beer
had
certainly
better
produce
some
results
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangegold
color
and
produces
a
prodigious
white
head
there
is
a
lightly
dusty
herbal
floral
and
grassy
aroma
to
this
beer
it
is
sharp
and
herbal
in
taste
and
is
very
well
carbonated
it
is
lightly
sweet
with
notes
of
honey
and
spices
it
is
almost
spicy
hot
in
character
quite
interesting
actually
this
beer
is
definitely
musty
in
character
it
is
like
it
has
been
lightly
dusted
with
some
pollen
from
a
slightly
astringent
yet
floral
flower
it
is
slightly
lemony
in
character
with
a
hint
of
apple
to
it
as
well
the
beer
gets
a
bit
sweeter
as
the
copious
amounts
of
carbonation
starts
to
dissappear
there
is
also
a
nuttiness
here
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
which
adds
to
the
complexity
i
really
like
the
interplay
between
the
spiciness
and
the
fruity
sweetness
a
very
good
balance
that
melds
into
an
incredible
beer
cloudy
dark
gold
w
lots
of
sediment
floating
about
highly
aggressive
inyourface
taste
dominated
by
hops
and
a
good
dose
of

bitter
and
not
for
the
faint
of

a
beer
w
tons
of
character
super
looking
tripel
thick
fluffy
head
that
would
not
quit
above

the

were

well
balanced
i
love

flavors

this
beer
tasted
well

the
elements
good
carbonation

elements
of

clementine
all
together
another
quality
offering
i
truly
believe
de
dolle
beers
are
great
for
introducing
non
bas
to
flavorful
origianl
beers
that
do
not
overwhelm
with
overpowering
oddball
flavors
this
beer
does
so
as
well
served
from
a
750
ml
green
bottle
with
a
cap
and
cork
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
a
de
dolle
beer
from
anything
other
than
an
11
2
oz
bottle
thank
god
i
had
more
than
twice
that
amount
to
enjoy
the
head
was
an
absolutely
huge
craggy
white
beast
it
settled
a
bit
but
still
looked
like
foam
on
a
stormravaged
sea
the
smell
is
a
bit
alcholic
with
lots
of
peppery
spice
and
substantial
tartness
much
is
happening
in
the
taste
spice
barnyard
funk
grape
and
cherry
it
was
a
bit
reminiscent
of
a
nice
grappa
despite
a
somewhat
alcoholic
blast
in
the
smell
its
wellhidden
in
the
taste
making
it
dangerously
drinkable
another
winner
from
de
dolle
the
beer
after
decanting
a
beclouded
yellow
orange
with
tons
of
dross
and
a
rather
substantial
head
that
is
creamy
in
consistency
and
an
off
white
color
the
lace
forms
a
fine
sheet
to
cover
the
glass
earthy
aroma
of
yeast
sweet
malted
grain
hints
of
pineapple
and
a
marvelous
beer
to
sniff
start
is
ambrosial
and
thickly
malted
top
is
fair
to
middling
in
feel
finish
is
stern
in
its
acidity
the
hop
powerful
but
pleasant
in
their
spiciness
very
dry
and
long
lasting
aftertaste
with
the
10
percent
abv
applying
a
bit
of
belly
warming
a
fine
beer
from
a
fine
brewery
and
one
i
see
rarely
for
some
reason
the
highly
charged
fizz
sound
from
popping
the
cap
leads
me
to
beleive
this
ones
got
some
carbonation
going
it
pours
out
a
murky
looking
golden
orange
tone
a
huge
uniformly
bubbled
ivory
white
head
graces
the
surface
it
becomes
rocky
as
it
dissipates
retetention
is
phenomenal
aroma
is
yeasty
and
bready
fruity
and
alcoholic
and
very
much
like
cookie
dough
really
a
nice
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
charged
but
not
so
much
i
cant
enjoy
this
nice
belgian
beer
body
seems
to
be
fairly
light
the
flavor
is
quite
doughy
a
little
like
rumcake
yeastiness
plays
a
big
part
in
the
overall
flavor
profile
some
fruity
esters
float
about
as
well
flavor
has
some
nice
spiciness
to
it
as
well
pepper
nutmeg
and
cinamon
overall
a
nice
brew
from
a
nice
brewery
now
this
was
an
interesting
find
i
have
to
saypours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
with
big
fluffy
head
that
natyrally
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
lemony
and
a
little
musty
with
a
sweet
background
really
liked
the
different
flavors
i
get
from
this
beer
very
yeasty
and
slightly
tart
with
a
malty
finish
that
lingers
along
with
some
alcohol
notes
this
beer
is
pretty
dangerous
because
it
seems
almost
to
easy
to
drink
with
all
that
alcoholic
punch
you
messed
with
the
mad
bitch
i
will
buy
this
again
dry
mouthfeel
full
and
warming
body
this
is
a
lively
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
intense
nothing
laid
back
i
enjoyed
much
of
the
experience
but
could
not
really
get
beyond
some
of
the
overpowering
bitterness
otherwise
quite
remarkable
orange
gold
color
large
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
fruity
spicy
and
yeasty
with
a
touch
of
mustiness
a
medium

belgian
triple
fruity
and
spicy
very
fine
champagne
like
carbonation
orange
apricot
grapefruit
peach
and
vanilla
flavors
spicy
and
tart
light
and
lively
there
is
a
slightly
alcohol
bite
at
10
but
it
not
that
noticeable
damn
interesting
beer
as
are
most
of
the
de
dolle
brews
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
and
very
spicy
comments
the
bros
say
to
rate
the
beers
using
personal
preferences
and
personally
this
is
one
of
the
best
bottles
that
i
have
ever
laid
down
what
a
pleasant
surprise
this
tripel
poured
a
yelloworange
hue
with
loads
of
foam
and
lace
from
start
to
finish
the
smell
was
very
fruity
with
a
hint
of
malts
the
taste
was
of
a
fruity
nature
with
a
soft
sweet
maltiness
rich
and
effervescent
make
sure
you
pour
this
tripel
nice
and
slow
or
youll
have
your
glass
full
of
bubbles
again
ill
repeat
fruity
aroma
and
a
soft
sweet
maltiness
rich
and
effervescent
impressive
tenacious
somewhat
devastating
defnitely
a
fullthrottle
beer
thats
only
accessible
to
the
initiated
be
prepared
this
one
will
kick
your
ass
this
is
the
beer
to
have
when
youre
only
having
one
half
tripel
half
artisanal
strong
pale
ale
this
was
some
whole
other
st
a
fine
classic
belgian
beer
with
stone
aggression
and
impact
f
some
beers
do
a
great
job
of
concealing
their
high
amounts
of
alcohol
this
brew
is
not
one
of
them
there
is
no
beer
with
a
more
appropriate
name
than
this
wow
the
cork
just
popped
on
this
one
after
i
took
the
cap
off
she
really
must
be
mad
the
head
flowing
out
of
it
needed
time
to
work
down
after
it
calmed
down
i
was
able
to
pour
a
cloudy
gold
beer
with
a
nice
bubbly
white
head
that
left
some
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
some
carbonation
was
present
there
shouldve
been
the
way
the
cork
exploded
off
it
had
an
aroma
of
citrus
clove
and
other
spices
the
flavor
was
of
clove
a
touch
of
anise
with
a
slight
smokiness
and
hint
of
the
alcohol
to
it
the
finish
was
a
touch
astrigent
with
elements
of
the
smokiness
with
the
alcohol
level
present
this
bitch
could
definately
slap
you
silly
clear
and
golden
brew
with
a
nice

white

spicy
smell
floral
a
bit
yeasty
and
somewhat
resembling

with

flavor

and
slightly

ill
have
it
again

to

a
few
minutes
before
i
was
able
to
pour

with

the

at

then
are
ensued
by
ripe

tropical
fruitiness
and
light
clove
phenol
light
yeast
must
is
perceptible
at
the
end
of
the
aroma
as
the
beer
breathes
alcohol
notes
fade
and
the
aroma
takes
on
a
florally
sweet
character
an
initial
snap
of
honey
sweetness
in
flavor
is
ensued
by
pleasant
herbal
melange
of
rosemary
star
anise
and
clove
then
a
drying
breadiness
that
offsets
sweetness
emerges
mid
palate
now
unhindered
peppery
lightly
solvent
like
alcohol
asserts
itself
into
the
flavor
profile
once
the
initially
furious
carbonation
mellows
the
body
is
revealed
to
be
moderate
w
a
dextrinous
mouthfeel
black
licorice
surfaces
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
and
lingers
into
the
finish
which
is
dry
heaty
lightly
sweet
and
eeriely
akin
to
the
italian
liquor
uzo
wow
mad
bitch
is
so
flavorful
she
almost
overwhelmed
my
taste
buds
the
alcohol
flavors
arent
masked
and
let
you
know
that
this
a
brew
to
be
reckoned
with
like
other
dolle
bros
brews
this
is
a
stylistic
bastard
and
is
reminescent
of
a
tripel
on
steroids
its
not
at
all
like
a
belgian
dark
strong
notes
knockout
of
a
brew
triple
in
style
with
the
hops
taken
up
a
notch
or
two
big
phenolic
and
fruit
ester
flavours
splashing
in
the
palate
mad
bitch
is
right
this
brew
does
a
number
on
your
tongue
by
slapping
it
around
and
telling
it
that
the
mad
bitch
is
boss
slap
enjoy
fantastic
aside
from
the
fairly
noticeable
alcohol
o
a
good
experience
and
probably
perfect
for
the
style
but
that
chalky
flavor
doesnt
rub
me
the
right
way

hands

the
best
belgian
tripel
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
a
consistent
competitor
for
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
great
belgian
and
enjoyed
every
sip
of
this
beauty

impressively

could
session
a

would

good
with
a
dinner
of
knockwurst
cabbage
onions
apples
red
pepper
over
bavarian
spaetzle
way
too
carbonated
for
me
overall
as
tripels
go
this
one
is
pretty
damned
good
manages
to
pack
in
typical
belgian
witbier
flavours
orange
peel
coriander
etc
with
a
good
alcohol
kick
without
tasting
at
all
boozy
if
youre
curious
with
regard
to
tripel
beers
this
is
an
excellent
starting

as
well
as
an

my
wife
says
the
perfect
combination
of
alcohol
and
flavor
on
a
tripel
overall
an
excellent
triple
that
hits
every
mark
for
the
style
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
as
i
cant
really
find
any
flaws
here
this
one
was
a
really
nice
belgian
ale
from
the
start
much
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
beers
hailing
from
the
country
tripel
karmeliet
was
quite
a
spicy
offering
with
a
very
lively
and
wellcarbonated
feel
to
it
that
proved
highly
enjoyable
and
every
drinkable
whilst
i
wouldnt
rank
it
as
one
of
my
favourites
in
the
style
it
was
definitely
one
worth
trying
and
proved
to
be
a
fairly
good
example
of
the
style
delish
so
good
i
see
that
a
lot
of
people
really
like
this
brew
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
i
wanted
to
but
alas
i
guess
i
just
dont
care
much
for
tripels
the
color
was
very
nice
golden
sunlight
with
a
beautiful
creamy
head
as
william
shatner
would
say
i
can
definitely
get
behind
that
but
then
i
smelled
and
tasted
it
its
that
damned
aftershave
meets
mouthwash
taste
i
cant
stand
so
i
might
be
a
bit
harsh
here
i
do
like
belgians
a
lot
but
just
not
tripels
however
as
my
ratings
suggest
i
tried
really
hard
not
to
let
my
distaste
for
the
style
affect
my
overall
judgment
of
the
beer
others
may
love
it
i
just
dont
very
possibly
the
best
belgian
triple
that
ive
ever
had
only
trouble
is
that
it
was
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
and
i
cant
find
it
at
any

its
exactly

is

is
luxurious

just

there

for

not
the
best
you
will
ever
come
across
overall
i
never
thought
id
find
a
tripel
that
appealed
to
me
but
this
is
toptier
it
lacks
the
alcohol
heat
that
ruins
many
other
tripels
for
me
drinks
great
on
a
summer
evening
like
drinking
tart
cherry
juice
spiced
with
clove
and
cinnamon
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
that
lent
a
nearperfect
drinkability
a
fantastic
followup
to
my
delirium
tremens
in
fact
i
enjoyed
it
even
more
loved
this
beer
and
ive
made
it
my
goto
overall
not
overly
complex
the
warming
alcohol
and
spice
are
what
stick
out
not
in
my
top
few
for
the
style
but
still
very
good
i
love
the
style
very
nicely
balanced
and
not
overly
caramelized
like
some
of
the
other
belgian
style
beers
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
future

disappointed
the
beer
looks
like
overfermented
witbier
lacking
tripel
charming
significantly
and
you
can
find
it
at
costco
too
at
least
in
michigan
never
would
have
thought
but
never
more
appreciative
transports
me
to
medieval
celebrations
with
spiritual
foundations
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
beers
of
the
over
1000
varieties
brewed
in
belgium
the
complexity
carbonation
and
overall
feel
of
this
beer
is
truly
remarkable
very
few
if
any
beers
brewed
anywhere
in
the
world
compare
to
tripel
karmeliet
any
beer
aficionado
must
try
tripel
karmeliet
at
least
once
in
their
life
to
expand
the
limits
of
their
beer
horizons
this
is
the
standard
for
all
other
belgiantype
ales
to
strive
towards
high
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
beer
to
savor
not
suitable
for
pounding
down
on
a
hot
summer
day
drink
a
tripel
karmeliet
slowly
and
believe
your
taste
buds
when
they
tell
you
this
is
as
close
to
a
religious
experience
as
any
beer
has
ever
come
even
in
finish
its
lovely
bouquet
holds
confidently
even
as
the
ales
quickly
drying
sweet
straw
bitterness
and
vinous
acidity
dries
the
beer
with
ease
theres
still
a
candied
and
perfumy
nature
to
the
beer
that
doesnt
overstep
its
boundaries
though
semidry
in
taste
the
ale
is
effortless
on
the
mouth
and
stomach
making
it
a
foolproof
choice
for
any
drinking
occasion
o
this
is
an
awesome
tripel
well
worth
the
price
absolutely
delicious
the
taste
has
a
nice
toasted
biscuit
character
and
belgian
sweetness
to
boast
about
some
vague
spice
and
pear
play
up
the
rear
little
to
no
hop
character
very
enjoyable
all
told
pours
into
a
transparent
light
gold
color
with
a
nice
head
smells
like
a
hoegaarden
orange
peel
coriander
some
lemon
some
vanilla
high
carbonation
light
body
it
tastes
like
an
improved
version
of
hoegaarden
with
a
fancier
flavor
as
it
gets
warmer
it
tastes
more
like
a
hard
liquor
similar
to
the
kwak
half
way
at
room
temperature
you
forget
you
are
drinking
a
beer
and
you
wonder
if
you
are
having
a
peach
liquor
o
a
very
good
tripel
easy
to
drink
any
time
of
the
year
definitely
recommended
and
its
relatively
easy
to
find
cheers
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
with
a
strong
almost
tropical
identity
i
hope
i
got
a
bad
bottle
this
is
one
of
the
worst
belgian
beers
i
have
tasted
as
a
brewer
the
obvious
flaw
is
too
much
grains
of
paradise
way
too
much
black
pepper
o
less
bitter
than
other
tripels
but
that
could
be
put
down
to
my
changing
palate
which
is
growing
accustomed
to
the
style
overall
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
better
tripel
surprisingly
decent
value
stacked
up
to
some
closer
to
home
tripels
some
beers
chase
after
style
definitions
the
rare
ones
define
a
style
this
would
be
a
case
of
the
latter
im
a
person
who
is
obsess
with
ipasdipaamerican
pale
ales
but
if
i
had
to
choose
another
style
beer
it
would
be
the
tripel
and
the
tripel
karmeliet
set
the
bar
for
this
style
this
beer
should
be
rated
higher
perfect
tripel
belgian
style
with
a
wheat
taste
you
gotta
love
this
beer
o
good
drink
wonderful
creamy
head
and
mouth
just
the
right
amount
of
spiciness
and
bitterness
peppery
and
bready
good
carbonation
beautiful
hazy
straw
color
with
rich
puffy
white
head
not
to
sweet
but
not
plain
or
bland
either
just
the
right
balance
of
flavors
one
of
the
best
in
its
category
superb
delicious
bright
extremely
well
balanced
excellent
mouthfeel
smooth
extremely
drinkable
complex
and
crisp
an
exceptional
beer
had
this
on
draft
at
federal
taphouse
in
lancaster
outstanding
beer
and
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
triples
i
have
had
shockingly
tasty
that
i
almost
gulped
down
despite
my
desire
to
see
if
it
would
change
as
it
warmed
maybe
next
time
i
would
love
to
find
a
bottle
to
see
if
it
was
as
good
they
have
100
drafts
but
go
with
this
one
wow
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
for
sure
excellent
across
the
board
great
depth
varied
flavors
and
a
delicate
balance
wow
o
better
than
i
imagined
and
i
imagined
it
would
be
good
a
fantastic
mix
of
sweet
and
tart
notes
with
nothing
overcoming
anything
else
theres
citrus
notes
theres
sweet
fruit
theres
even
that
pinch
of
grassiness
more
the
flavor
of
hops
than
bitterness
a
fantastic
brew
so
good
i
plan
on
revisiting
this
one
often
this
summer
it
seems
perfect
for
hotter
weather
pretty
high
carbonation
and
a
medium
light
body
really
enjoyable
beer
would
be
excellent
on
a
hot
summer
day
by
far
one
of
the
best
beers
that
is
mass
produced
i
have
found
variance
though
from
small
bottles
vs
big
bottles
particularly
when
drinking
it
in
the
eu
the
fresher
it
is
the
more
spice
and
flavor
it
has
this
is
a
very
refined
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
with
no
weird
tastes
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
this
one
330ml

medium

freshness
in
the
middle
long
sweet

lingers
in
a

peach

refreshing
delightful
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
tried
and
id
easily
put
it
on
par
with
la
fin
du
monde
as
for
which
one
of
these
is
superior
i
dont
know
of
i
could
give
you
an
answer
a
bit
steep
at
14
per
750ml
or
6
per
12oz
bottle
but
i
feel
like
this
was
worth
the
money
with
la
fin
being
so
much
cheaper
i
dont
know
if
ill
try
this
again
any
time
soon
but
its
definitely
at
the
top
of
its
game
for
the
style
light
bodied
with
champagne
like
effervescence
surprisingly
mild
in
flavor
which
is
awesome
light
toasty
graininess
dry
biscuits
sweet
fruitiness
along
the
midpalate
with
an
extremely
dry
and
clean
finish
with
an
earthy
herbal
hop
flavor
extremely
subtle
with
delicate
flavors
that
layer
beautifully
light
refreshingly
and
full
of
immense
subtle
character
that
is
in
perfect
balance
tripel
karmeliet
would
make
a
fantastic
pairing
with
boisterous
conversation
and
hors
d
oeuvres
or
a
flavorful
meal
overall
a
good
quality
belgian
tripel
nice
complexity
of
wheat
belgian
yeasts
orchard
fruits
spice
and
some
heavier
abv
notes
well
worth
the
price
taste
was
sweeter
than
i
remembered
for
tripels
but
good
got
a
little
bit
of
a
banana
on
the
tongue
it
also
seemed
to
have
a
very
light
caramel
tinge
to
it
in
the
mouth
the
left
a
tingle
at
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
a
delicious
beer
a
very
easy

8

abv
triple
beer
was
a
bit
disappointed
this
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
best
tripels
in
the
world
but
ive
had
many
beers
that
were
much
better
it
is
a
good
decent
beer
but
not
outstanding
i
miss
some
spices
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
good
full
but
a
bit
flat
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
i
just
expected
so
much
more
of
it
this
beer
is
awesome
how
can
you
hate
on
this
fiyah
o
one
of
the
best
aromatic
beers
i
ever
had
prost
while
not
a
big
fan
of
triples
this
one
is
pretty
good
the
subdued
alcohol
taste
makes
it
easy
to
drink
clear
golden
white
head
with
good
formation
and
retention
in
the
nose
fruity
spicy
and
orange
maltiness
in
second
plan
with
earthiness
os
yeast
in
the
taste
nice
balance
maltiness
orange
and
yeast
fruitness
really
in
equilibirum
really
great
belgian
tripel
one
of
my
favorites
the
taste
starts
out
a
little
yeasty
and
definitely
carbonated
this
carbonation
holds
as
the
taste
adds
a
little
tartness
a
bit
of
banana
sneaks
in
as
well
the
starting
taste
however
remains
as
the
backbone
throughout
the
rest
of
the
tastes
simply
accent
the
flavor
overy
complex
with
lots
going
on
at
the
same
time
everytime
i
took
a
sip
i
had
to
add
a
note
a
marvelous
beer
brewed
with
authentic
traditional
belgian
style
thats
what
this
is
oi
found
this
tripel
quite
unique
it
has
a
bit
of
saisonlike
character
to
it
purchased
at
total
wine
in
naplesfl
for
15
99
for
a
4pk
of
11
2
oz
bottles
o
i
cant
say
its
my
favorite
tripel
theres
a
lot
of
good
ones
out
there
and
this
is
to
me
lacks
the
depth
of
some
of
the
other
belgians
and
even
some
american
examples
but
the
crispness
here
enhanced
by
healthy
carbonation
is
a
pleasant
surprise
ogreat
tripel
great
wheat
taste
and
light
wonderful
amounts
of
sweetness
and
spice
o
an
idyllic
belgian
tripel
ale
a
true
nod
to
the
pilsener
heritage
with
tons
of
saaz
hops
and
clean
crisp
drinking
experience
the
karmeliet
abby
cleverly
used
wheat
and
oat
as
they
advertise
instead
or
in
addition
to
belgian
candi
sugar
this
provides
extra
alcohol
and
grain
flavor
while
remaining
dry
the
balance
in
this
beer
is
so
complex
with
low
aromatics
big
hop
flavor
low
bitterness
and
lots
of
oomph
for
me
this
is
a
whimsical
blend
of
classic
saaz
hop
flavor
with
high
quality
malts
brewed
in
the
belgian
tradition
and
is
remarkable
every
sip
of
the
way
basically
this
one
was
nearly
void
of
all
of
the
really
enjoyable
aspects
of
this
style
perhaps
my
bottle
was
a
lame
duck
because
clearly
this
is
a
highly
rated
version
of
the
style
but
i
call
em
as
i
taste
em
i
will
give
this
another
shot
before
i
call
it
good
probably
the
second
best
tripel
out
there
behind
only
the
one
from
westmalle
which
to
me
is
the
end
all
and
be
all
of
the
style
this
one
pours
a
lot
more
clear
than
that
one
yellowy
and
shiny
with
an
inch
of
really
active
white
bubbles
and
soda
looking
carbonation
racing
to
the
surface
the
nose
is
sweet
probably
from
the
oats
and
the
yeast
is
nicely
bready
light
fruit
notes
as
well
maybe
pears
or
green
apples
the
taste
is
immediately
peppered
from
the
yeast
spicy
really
quite
intense
as
it
finishes
its
a
good
balance
with
the
sweeter
malt
the
feel
is
probably
what
makes
this
what
it
is
a
beer
of
lore
thats
because
its
ultra
carbonated
with
an
extremely
dry
finish
it
tickles
my
tongue
quite
hard
and
swallows
easy
with
just
the
pepper
left
on
my
tongue
soft
pepper
white
pepper
but
pepper
all
the
same
just
a
hint
of
warm
alcohol
too
maybe
a
little
more
than
necessary
prevents
sessionability
but
i
like
whats
going
on
here
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
nearly
two
fingers
white
head
small
bubbles
pretty
fast
dissipation
fruity
nose
sweet
peaches
green
apple
with
light
coriander
aroma
in
the
finish
the
pepper
notes
are
a
bit
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
pushing
the
fruitiness
aside
full
mouthfeel
average
effervescence
lingering
coriander
in
the
finish
a
pretty
full
bodied
and
spicy
variation
on
the
style
certainly
unique
in
my
experience
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
a
5
s
5
t

overall
a
great
beer
that
strikes
me
more
as
a
fusion
between
a
saison
and
a
trippel
it
wasnt
what
i
was
at
all
expecting
but
it
was
a
very
nice
experience
after
sitting
down
with
some
time
it
is
hard
not
to
really
marvel
at
the
complexity
of
this
brew
and
just
how
great
it
is
brings
some
flavors
that
can
be
abrasive
to
the
table
but
they
all
seem
to
balance
out
very
well
not
the
first
time
and
wont
be
the
last
time
i
have
this
one
a
must
try
sampled
from
the
33cl
brown
glass
bottle
the
blonde
hazy
beer
leaves
a
nice
1
5
inch
white
head
a
bready
aroma
predominates
a
citrusy
yeasty
flavor
is
evident
light
mouthfeel
the
high
alcohol
is
not
at
all
evident
this
is
a
unique
very
special
beer
as
it
warms
it
becomes
not
quite
as
good
o
im
more
used
to
this
type
of
flavor
than
i
was
when
i
first
tried
sofie
just
not
digging
it
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
clearly
my
palate
needs
more
schooling
since
this
is
a
top
rated
ba
brew
perhaps
an
old
bottle
though
since
others
report
milder
flavors
no
explanation
of
the
code
on
dating
beer
but
there
is
a
best

block
on
the
label
with

in
it
whatever
that
means
bottle
conditioned
so
perhaps
the
yeast
just
went
wild
it
really
does
taste
like
a
pungent
farmhouse
saison
rather
than
a
tripel
o
really
clean
and
crisp
beer
well
integrated
flavors
complementing
each
other
with
no
one

a
brilliantly
clear

with
a
large

lots
of
visible
carbonation
smell
is
very
fruity
and
yeasty
some
citrus
to
it
taste
has
a
little
funk
to
it
and
a
lot
of
yeast
character
fades
into
a
lingering
alcoholic
sensation
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
balances
the
strong
flavor
nicely
for
a
good
crisp
finish
overall
a
very
good
beer
traditional
tripel
style
overall
one
of
the
very
very
good
tripels
ive
had
maybe
not
as
awesomely
incredible
as
the
westmalle
tripel
but
definitely
up
there
with
the
big
boys
im
so
glad
this
beer
is
easily
accessible
in
my
area
ah
perfection
i
have
had
many
tripel
karmeleits
and
it
is
a
time
for
a
review
had
at
yard
house
on
tap
in
fenway
this
has
a
bland
blonde
color
which
masks
the
taste
smells
of
a
malty
scent
the
taste
though
resonates
with
a
great
blend
of
hops
and
malt
which
is
hard
to
match
i
like
this
a
lot
great
stand
by
my
go
to
fantastic
beer
cant
say
enough
about
this
perfect
beer
oits
decent
ill
drink
this
beer
again
but
not
seek
it
too
often
o
really
solid
beer
and
the
torchbearer
for
this
style
must
try
for
those
that
appreciate
belgian
styles
o
a
fantastic
tripel
karmeleit
meets
all
the
criteria
for
a
fantastic
beer
perhaps
it
is
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
had
and
it
is
a
great
way
to
celebrate
life
which
is
why
i
am
drinking
it
today
to
me
there
is
nothing
better
than
that
full
belgian
yeast
profile
it
screams
happiness
and
this
beer
brings
it
o
great
beer
wish
i
had
the
whole
one
to
myself
but
unfortunately
i
specifically
bought
this
one
for
my
wife
ill
grab
another
for
myself
some
day
for
sure
and
i
recommend
that
you
do
the
same
tripel
karmeliet
is
definitely
worthy
of
its
high
stature
despite
weighing
in
at
only
8
4
abv
it
has
enough
character
to
stand
with
the
top
examples
of
the
style
overall
great
stuff
a
fine
tripel
reviewed
82607
this
really
has
that
wondeful
combination
of
a
bit
of
fruitness
of
la
fin
du
monde
but
also
that
really
strong
dry
finish
with
the
classic
belgian
tripels
its
a
light
refreshing
beer
and
bounces
around
the
palate
my
favorite
non
barrel
aged
tripel
its
vdubbs
rehearsal
dinner
and
this
beer
stood
out
for
me
on
the
menu
its
been
too
long
since
my
last
karmeliet
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
gold
topped
by

the
nose
comprises
cracked
wheat
light
black
pepper
clove
restrained
citrus
i
imagine
a
small
literallyfruity
straightjacket
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
yeast
and
its
spices
dancing
their
way
into
my
heart
or
at
least
more
directly
my
stomach
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
as
solid
a
tripel
as
i
remember
this
one
tends
toward
the
drier
more
saisonlike
end
of
the
spectrum
than
the
sweeter
end
its
good
times
regardless
excellent
beer
very
complex
and
original
i
was
expecting
a
good
tripel
but
not
necessarily
fun
and
original
if
you
like
belgian
beers
this
is
a
must
the
texture
is
light
with
the
right
amount
of
fizz
tripel
karmeliet
was
amazing
once
poured
into
the
glass
from
the
bottle
the
color
was
a
great
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
short
lasting
head
to
it
the
aroma
was
definitely
fruity
but
not
overwhelming
the
taste
was
fantastic
light
and
slightly
fruity
very
smooth
beer
highly
recommended
one
of
the
better
tripels
on
the
market
but
not
the
best
rjt
really
a
nice
beer
that
would
be
amazing
with
both
less
carbonation
and
a
finer
perle
really
love
the
complexity
in
the
nose
but
it
gets
just
a
little
lost
on
the
palate
o
this
beer
was
a
treat
so
smooth
easy
on
the
palate
left
me
wanting
more
d
great
anytime
beer
like
a
beerchampagne
with
a
hint
of
pancake
overall
drinkability
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
ranked
so
high
its
very
well
done
from
start
to
finish
great
to
look
at
equally
great
to
smell
and
taste
dangerously
drinkable
as
after
finishing
1
bottle
i
didnt
hesitate
to
get
a
2nd
went
well
with
dinner
sweet
and
spicy
chicken
and
brown
rice
and
the
2nd
bottle
was
a
great
dessert
a
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
long
lasting
white
creamy
hed
on
the
pour
into
a
chalice
aroma
and
taste
of
belgian
yeast
bread
a
nice
ripe
fruity
bouquet
with
some
nice
citrus
mildly
spicy
fruity
hops
a
medium
bodied
ale
crisp
with
lively
carbonation
and
sweet
dry
spicy

on
the

finish
is
sweet
biscuit
malt
belgian
yeast
bread
citrus

fruity
notes
with
some

for
balance
overall
a
excellent
flavorful
and
enjoyable
ale
very
nice
indeed
food
match
tripels
are
a

or
cheese
beer
take
your
pick
on

at
elgin
public
house
poured
into
branded
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
glassware
with
a
massive

and
bright
golden

this
was
my
first
tripel
style
beer
smells
of
honey
orange
spicy
fruity
mango
deliciousness
sweet
taste
and
the
balance
of
the
beer
makes
this
a
very
sneaky
8
4
abv
clean
and
smooth
mouthfeel
but
i
might
be
biased
as
i
dont
like
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
my
beers
finishes
dry
and
amplified
alcohol
taste
towards
the
bottom
overall
i
loved
it
and
cant
wait
to
try
more
tripel
style
ales
have
my
eye
on
the
allagash
curieux
next
o
this
is
a
solid
brew
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
super
traditional
triple
as
the
flavors
remind
me
more
of
a
saison
but
this
is
a
delicious
treat
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
like
it
id
drink
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
it
this
belgian
brew
is
a
very
gassy
and
very
smooth
drink
with
a
hint
of
fruit
tasty
brew
to
say
the
least
light
blonde
appearance
with
a
fluffy
head
could
sip
gulp
or
chug
this
one
there
is
essentially
no
bite
and
leaves
you
wanting
another
this
beer
is
a
definite
must
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
had
never
heard
reviews
or
tasted
before
i
was
really
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
drinking
it
all
the
way
to
the
end
for
me
normally
a
tripel
is
a
bit
of
a
challenge
as
it
overpowers
me
by
the
end
of
the
beer
this
one
tasted
great
all
the
way
through
would
buy
again
and
recommend
good
tripel
definitely
different
than
other
tripels
but
worth
trying
it
had
a
superb
head
and
was
good
tasting
to
me
on
the
whole
towards
the
end
it
got
a
little
too
sticky
for
my
taste
but
honestly
that
is
something
i
dont
like
about
most
tripels
would
drink
again
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
overall
impression
a
good
example
of
a
finely
crafted
belgian
tripel
exhibiting
notes
of
clove
and
banana
with
soft
pale
malt
character
and
heavy
malt
mouthfeel
crisp
cleansing
carbonation
revives
palate
for
next
gulp
o
a
great
beer
but
cannot
stand
when
compared
with
trappists
tripel
its
medium
body
and
fruity
flavor
resemble
the
trappists
but
it
lacks
its
cousins
bitterness
and
complexity
notes
why
did
it
take
me
so
long
to
try
this
brew
recommended
over
and
over
again
being
typically
not
too
keen
on
a
good
part
of
triples
i
overlooked
it
until
now
well
glad
to
fix
that
mistake
fruity
and
dry
this
flows
great
and
is
a
nice
crowd
pleaser
im
sure
revisiting
and
sharing
pair
this
beer
honey
smoked
salmon
over
a
rice
pilaf
or
get
a
smoked
spicy
sausage
with
sauerkraut
caramelized
onions
and
smoked
peppers
for
some
contrast
overall
a
standard
tripel
that
everybody
should
enjoy
at
one
point
in
a
persons
life
enjoyed
in
the
past
and
will
be
enjoying
more
in
the
future
too
overall
quite
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
nice
triple
and
renowned
for
a
good
reason
o
not
as
thrilling
as
westmalle
but
this
is
my
2
for
the
triple
style
pretty
flawless
and
appropriate
most
any
time
yes
this
was
strong
but
it
never
felt
it
while
i
couldnt
get
down
this
quickly
i
never
wanted
to
because
i
never
had
anything
quite
like
this
before
the
way
this
beer
faded
from
a
wit
to
a
tripel
during
each
sip
was
a
wonder
to
behold
as
the
candy
sugar
quietly
made
its
presence
felt
its
not
often
that
a
beer
this
bold
sneaks
up
on
you
but
this
one
fit
the
bill
and
for
any
belgian
beer
lover
this
is
certainly
a
musttry
its
a
shame
i
cant
find
this
in
a
larger
size
overall
a
very
drinkable
trip
with
only
a
slight
maltiness
that
adds
definition
and
depth
to
this
perfect
all
day
ale
overall
a
little
light
and
lacking
sour
more
towards
sweet
but
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
good
tripel
malt
character
is
slightly
lacking
and
the
dominant
flavors
are
somewhat
banal
but
when
the
floral
notes
surface
this
beer
shines
a
little
on
the
hot
side
flavors
of
malts
grassy
hops
lemon
lime
candy
sugar
fresh
bread
light
spice
overall
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
brews
refreshing
full
body
with
nice
malt
sweetness
some
complexity
but
very
drinkable
tripel
isnt
a
style
im
generally
fond
of
but
ill
be
getting
some
more
of
this
one
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
any
triplets
yet
but
this
is
definitely
a
must
try
for
anyone
then
again
this
is
how
ipas
started
out
for
me
i
hated
them
and
then
found
myself
craving
some
of
them
a
great
beer
yeasty
but
not
ridiculously
so
complicated
flavor
smells
great
overall
a
great
example
of
the
belgian
tripel
style
it
is
awesome
i
highly
recommend
it
especially
if
you
like
the
style
overall
an
excellent
beer
one
of
my
favorites
o
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
was
its
smell
had
all
the
tenents
of
a
good
tripel
drank
smooth
and
never
was
sweet
the
body
was
clean
and
drinkable
high
carbonation
is
perfect
for
the
style
serving
type
bottle
excellent
beer
to
be
had
at
a
tapas
restaurant
a
variety
of
seafoods
was
my
personal
preference
the
beer
was
refreshing
and
also
very
full
of
body
which
helps
the
hollow
after
taste
of
most
seafood
as
with
most
seafood
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
will
always
entice
the
pallet
there
were
other
delicacies
that
went
well
with
the
triple
karmeliet
too
a
beer
to
be
had
with
a
variety
of
fine
foods
top
notch
compliment
to
the
meal
a
very
nice
beer
a
truly
classic
take
on
the
style
personally
for
me
id
like
it
to
be
just
a
tad
bigger
but
make
no
mistake
this
is
one
satisfying
tripel
that
is
an
absolute
must
try
like
so
many
others
this
a
bit
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
halfway
through
the
abv
is
making
its
presence
felt
in
a
nice
warming
kind
of
way
great
brew
o
quite
different
from
most
other
tripels
ive
had
in
terms
of
the
applepear
flavors
as
opposed
to
dark
fruits
wellbuilt
and
tasty
just
a
bit
too
sweet
o
the
mouthfeel
just
ruins
it
for
me
maybe
its
because
of
the
taste
i
had
on
the
day
but
somehow
every
sip
i
took
was
taken
over
by
a
lot
of
carbonation
tingling
also
the
flavor
is
too
one
dimensional
theres
not
much
more
then
citrus
fruits
the
only
good
part
is
that
you
dont
get
any
alcohol
at
all
which
is
an
achievement
considering
the
abv
overall
the
fruitiness
is
enjoyable
and
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
as
time
goes
on
it
all
becomes
too
much
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
overall
55
its
that
good
im
no
tripel
fiend
but
this
one
is
amazing
something
like
this
really
gets
me
amped
up
about
beer
o
really
enjoyable
the
fruit
and
spice
is
not
overpowering
well
placed
within
the
style
t
m
taste
is
being
overridden
by
a
toohigh
amount
of
carbonation
underneath
there
is
wheat
a
little
hop
dried
fruit
pretty
dense
mouthfeel
maybe
a
little
too
much
but
not
bad
by
any
means
o
spot
on
for
the
style
lots
of
complexity
the
spice
and
tartness
keep
the
sugar
from
overwhelming
the
beer
like
in
many
other
interpretations
overall
a
great
beer
that
is
easily
drank
would
reccomend
this
to
anyone
as
it
really
has
such
a
smooth
taste
i
think
anyone
could
enjoy
it
o
overall
a
tasty
brew
that
offers
up
a
very
fruity
bouquet
loads
of
flavour
easy
drinking
and
a
dangerously
hidden
abv
i
quite
enjoyed
this
brew
and
am
glad
that
i
was
able
to
grab
a
few
bottles
would
i
buy
it
again
absolutely
o
excellent
tripel
very
complex
balanced
and
flavorful
this
beer
would
pair
beautifully
with
any
type
of
seafood
or
meat
hey
its
a
good
beer
that
drinks
well
o
you
can
wake
me
up
at
night
for
this
one
o
decent
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
stand
out
for
me
one
of
the
finest
belgian
tripels
ive
come
across
hits
all
the
right
notes
definitely
will
be
back
for
more

finish

still

uncomplicated
but
not
simple
and
well

between
the

and
the

o
a
very
maltheavy
tripel
you
can
really
taste
the
different
kinds
of
malts
that
they
used
so
its
not
so
onedimensional
quite
malty
sweet
in
general
with
the
strong
yeast
picking
up
a
close
second
place
no
real
noticeable
hops
or
bitterness
tasty
and
delicious
example
of
the
style
a
musttry
if
you
like
maltier
tripels
the
karmeliet
tripel
is
easier
to
drink
than
say
a
la
chouffe
there
is
nothing
acidic
or
citruslike
about
the
karmeliet
tripel
its
a
beer
that
doesnt
have
profundity
but
youll
find
yourself
reaching
for
it
again
and
again
this
was
a
great
tripel
it
was
complex
and
refreshing
the
abv
was
well
hidden
this
was
dangerously
easy
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
o
worth
checking
out
for
sure
a
solid
beer
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
without
being
too
obvious
about
it
this
is
what
a
tripel
should
taste
like
nicely
done
editi
have
since
had
this
beer
again
on
multiple
occasions
and
it
is
coming
back
into
my
into
my
good
graces
perhaps
the
bottle
that
i
reviewed
got
overheated
because
honestly
that
it
what
is
tasted
like
skunked
regardless
i
am
bumping
up
the
smell
taste
and
overall
score
by
a
half
to
a
full
point
pours
deep
golden
with
a
bright
white

foamlike
two
finger
head
thin

as
the

recedes
clove
earthy
yeast
grassy
and
herbal
notes
and
medicinal
phenols
on
the
nose
fairly
spicy
and
peppery
significant
fruit
notes
perhaps
a
bit
of
papaya
and
mango
heavy
alcohol
warmth
that
becomes
more
and
more
evident
as
the
brew
warms
and
is
consumed
fairly
high
fizzy
carbonation
on
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
touch
of
syrup
very
complex
with
a
very
strong
alcohol
presence
but
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
medium
bodied
with
a
rather
high
level
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
drinkability
is
outstanding
yeah
thats
my
bottom
line
for
tripel
karmeliet
outstanding
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
probably
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
ales
so
far
o
this
is
a
great
triple
i
been
pushed
enough
times
this
week
to
try
it
and
i
am
so
happy
i
finally
got
around
to
it
it
is
not
complex
with
flavor
but
very
bold
and
robust
indeed
any
fan
of
triple
belgians
this
is
a
must
if
you
are
new
to
the
style
you
may
not
appreciate
it
as
much
but
i
would
definitely
enjoy
to
try
this
again
great
beer
do
i
genuinely
enjoy
this
beer
in
small
quantities
but
this
is
not
my
preferred
style
and
the
bananabutter
finish
wears
on
me
over
time
a
25
4
ounce
bomber
is
o
really
really
love
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
overall
a
great
beer
the
fact
that
it
is
out
of
date
seems
to
not
be
an
issue
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
if
you
like
tripels
this
a
must
try
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
overall
this
is
a
different
kind
of
brew
for
me
kind
of
hoppytasting
akmost
but
without
the
piney
flavor
i
guess
this
is
what
an
oat
wheat
barley
from
belgium
tastes
like
my
apologies
i
had
a
very
timeconsuming
review
erased
into
the
nether
regions
of
cyberspace
and
this
is
no
reflection
of
the
time
or
quality
of
that
production
but
what
i
would
like
to
state
here
is
that
there
is
a
very
nice
relatively
new
belgium
pub
in
garden
grove
california
called
the
globe
which
has
this
and
about
25
other
beautiful
belgian
brews
on
tap
i
have
no
interest
in
the
business
except
for
converting
my
hardearned
wages
into
beautiful
belgian
suds
but
id
like
to
make
more
people
in
the
area
aware
of
this
site
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
fizzy
head
very
herbal
nose
a
little
yeasty
as
well
tastewise
its
a
pretty
big
brew
considering
how
light
it
feels
herbalmedicinal
sort
of
flavor
plays
with
yeast
and
fruity
phenols
i
think
its
a
good
beer
and
a
major
standout
flavor
profile
among
tripels
this
was
my
first
time
tasting
this
tripel
and
it
is
perfect
for
a
summer
day
very
distinctive
a
world
class
tripel
the
only
negative
comment
i
might
make
involves
that
carbonation
i
mentioned
earlier
this
is
a
beer
that
can
make
you
full
but
at
8
4
that
isnt
really
a
bad
thing
o
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
relatively
refreshing
even
though
there
is
a
fairly
high
abv
in
which
the
alcohol
is
detectable
this
is
much
more
of
a
sipping
beer
but
is
very
good
very
good
example
of
the
style
aroma
is
of
apple
pear
clove
coriander
and
that
signature
belgian
yeast
character
the
smell
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
the
taste
is
spot
on
with
the
aroma
except
with
a
massive
dose
of
prickly
carbonation
im
also
getting
some
citrus
on
the
back
end
that
wasnt
as
present
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
some
mild
hop
bitterness
this
is
your
textbook
belgian
ale
spicy
prickly
and
fruity
not
much
to
critique
here
though
one
could
argue
that
the
extensive
carbonation
overwhelms
some
of
the
subtler
elements
in
the
taste
regardless
this
is
one
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
that
goes
down
way
too
fast
for
its
abv

very

an
excellent
tripel
and
worth
a
revisit
o
one
of
the
best
tripels
out
there
i
think
its
very
tasty
and
has
the
perfect
body
needed
for
a
great
belgian
this
is
one
odd
tripel
if
you
had
given
this
to
me
blindly
and
told
me
that
it
was
malt
liquor
i
would
say
bravo
this
is
fantastic
however
as
an
authentic
belgian
tripel
it
is
an
unbalanced
mess
and
a
disappointment
to
boot
on
top
of
that
it
had
me
all
fooled
into
thinking
i
was
going
to
be
treated
to
a
nice
gueuze
which
i
am
now
craving
at
11
a
bottle
there
are
much
better
triples
to
be
had
but
i
am
also
inclined
to
give
this
one
a
second
chance
after
all
if
i
am
reading
the
date
correctly
this
beer
is
a
year
and
a
half
beyond
peak
freshness
o
given
its
overall
rating
i
had
expected
more
complexity
i
do
suppose
that
this
is
a
spot
on
representation
of
the
style
it
hits
right
as
it
should
drinks
nicely
enough
and
the
alcohol
is
not
perceivable
this
is
a
solid
tripel
its
pretty
balanced
and
its
distinctly
belgian
its
a
little
sweeter
than
i
like
a
tripel
but
its
good
worth
a
try
overall
unrelenting
and
unapologetically
belgian
you
want
to
taste
belgian
yeast
drink
this
too
aggressive
in
the
long
run
a
tremendous
beer
all
around
no
weak
spots
easy
to
drink
smooth
alcohol
is
present
but
plays
nicely
would
love
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
a
nice
brew
but
this
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
gets
a
bit
boozy
as
it
warms
in
some
ways
it
reminds
me
of
a
cordial
or
sherry
more
than
a
beer
i
can
appreciate
that
this
is
a
nice
ale
it
just
isnt
the
ale
for
me
this
ones
been
revisited
a
few
times
since
my
initial
review
and
always
tastes
toptier
overall
a
great
belgian
style
beer
that
showed
its
class
great
taste
rolling
around
in
the
mouth
followed
by
a
very
enjoyable
finish
o
what
a
great
surprise
doesnt
have
as
many
dimensions
as
many
belgian
tripels
but
when
you
make
something
simple
this
good
dont
mess
around
with
a
bunch
of
tricks
great
beer
overall
very
nice
unique
tripel
the
750s
green
bottles
ugh
go
for
between
1113
around
here
for
that
its
not
a
bad
deal
and
provides
a
nice
counterpoint
to
chimays
version
i
have
yet
to
try
the
westmalle
and
st
bernardus
this
is
very
good
balanced
beer
with
the
yeast
doing
wonderful
things
but
nto
getting
overly
complicated
or
muddled
still
for
15
a
4pk
i
dont
think
i
can
give
this
more
than
a
solid
b
even
if
its
edging
higher
o
if
youre
a
fan
of
triples
you
will
not
disappointed
dangerously
delicious
and
coy
at
hiding
that
8

enjoy
at
home
sitting
down
poured
from
bottle
into
chalice
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
big
white
pillowy
head
sweet
floral
and
herbal
odor
amazing
aroma
with
vanilla
alcohol
and
some
aroma
hop
heavy
sweet
taste
with
some
bitterness
medium
body
with
lively
carbonation
and
creamy
silky
texture
strong
and
long
alcoholic
finish
with
all
the
aromas
which
appears
earlier
fantastic
beer
overall
a
truly
astounding
beer
i
have
tasted
a
few
belgen
beers
before
but
this
surmounts
them
all
by
far
o
an
incredible
beer
there
was
so
much
at
work
here
beyond
my
ability
to
describe
o
an
amazing
beer
something
that
could
have
more
than
one
and
something
worth
recommending
to
all
this
beer
is
extremely
approachable
and
had
me
wanting
more
a
very
well
crafted
tripel
one
of
the
better
examples
i
can
recall
having
tried
complex
nose
and
taste
smooth
and
well
balanced
o
this
is
a
great
tripel
yet
being
spoiled
i
have
had
better
if
you
come
across
this
one
and
can
spare
the
4
per
bottle
i
say
give
it
a
shot
d
i
really
enjoyed
the
malt
bill
of
this
one
but
its
almost
a
tad
too
sweet
and
needs
more
depth
in
the
finish
would
revisit
ontap
an
easy
to
drink
tripel
not
over
the
top
but
far
from
boring
i
will
drink
this
again
o
go
buy
it
extremely
quaffable
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
enjoy
it
any
time
of
year
o
overall
i
like
this
beer
fairly
classic
as
far
as
a
tripel
is
concerned
good
flavors
from
the
yeast
plenty
of
belgian
character
and
a
nice
sweetness
very
enjoyable
doa
notes
pairs
well
with
greg
brown
folk
music
this
beer
continues
to
bloom
as
time
wears
on
and
i
find
myself
enjoying
it
more
in
tandem
definitely
worth
a
shot
thanks
todd
overall
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
very
good
overall
impressive
appearance
followed
by
a
bold
sweet
and
spicy
aroma
then
the
very
sweet
fruity
and
spicy
taste
a
little
light
from
the
huge
amount
of
carbonation
regardless
a
well
made
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
but
not
at
the
price
of
almost
7
dollars
a
bottle
golden
strawcolored
with
a
rich
thick
head
aroma
of
very
citrusy
hops
almost
like
sprite
malty
rich
sweetness
to
the
hop
flavor
with
definite
lemony
finish
really
pleasant
bright
carbonation
i
typically
dont
like
tripels
to
be
this
sweet
but
i
appreciate
how
this
one
kind
of
marks
its
territory
as
a
certain
take
on
the
style
overall
this
is
a
solid
tripel
hits
all
the
marks
not
the
best
ive
had
but
still
a
worldclass
version
of
the
style
overall
one
of
the
best
tasting
tripels
i
have
ever
had
complex
and
flavorful
but
not
challenging
very
refined
makes
an
excellent
sipper
and
i
took
a
good
long
time
to
finish
my
serving
enjoying
every
sip
ogenerally
for
me
this
style
gets
pretty
harsh
and
unenjoyable
ive
had
many
bad
examples
of
tripels
this
beer
just
redefines
what
i
think
of
them
it
is
so
great
and
complex
with
such
a
smooth
taste
with
that
typical
explosive
belgian
mouthfeel
i
could
always
have
this
refreshing
and
fulfilling
i
received
a
gift
set
of
this
brew
with
a
glass
from
my
fiancee
11
2
oz
bottle
poured
into
the
comically
over
sized
chalice
that
came
with
the
set
after
the
pour
it
becomes
very
clear
why
the
glass
is
sized
and
shaped
the
way
it
is
the
clear
orange
liquid
collects
in
the
bulb
shaped
bottom
of
the
glass
and
about
4
inches
of
head
collect
on
top
splotchy
lacing
is
left
behind
and
after
the
head
settles
down
about
a
centimeter
of
thick
white
foam
retains
nicely
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
huge
notes
of
lemon
zest
waves
of
chamomile
a
touch
of
clove
along
with
some
sourdough
bread
the
taste
is
starts
off
with
moderate
sweetness
with
notes
of
fruit
citrus
is
present
along
with
sourdough
bread
the
finish
is
dry
great
balance
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
the
feel
is
highly
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
overall
this
a
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
tripel
it
drinks
more
like
a
belgian
pale
which
makes
it
a
little
dangerous
o
excellent
triple
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
pours
a
slightly
murky
light
yellow
with
a
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
fruity
with
some
spice
and
very
floral
aromas
taste
is
of
grain
spice
yeast
and
floral
flavors
there
is
an
almost
medicinal
bitterness
on
the
palate
that
sticks
around
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
but
its
much
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
o
a
really
solid
tripel
but
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
to
make
me
love
it
o
real
nice
tripel
to
my
preferences
its
better
than
the
st
bernardus
as
well
as
the
westmalle
refreshing
clean
drinkable
medium
bodied
with
some
very
exciting
carbonation
this
beers
mouthfeel
gives
it
a
rather
deceptive
drinkability
the
body
really
allows
for
full
taste
bud
immersion
into
this
beer
while
never
becoming
coating
or
sticky
which
one
might
expect
from
a
beer
of
8
4
abv
the
carbonation
is
just
as
expected
it
fizzles
and
rumbles
and
explodes
in
your
mouth
trying
to
disturb
your
delicious
experience
luckily
the
body
is
big
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
carbonation
body
is
medium
while
oat
adds
creamy
sensation
to
the
fluffy
mouthfeel
this
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
foamy
pure
white
head
and
still
great
carbonation
some
haze
from
sediment
smells
of
fruit
malts
and
some
sweetness
not
overpowering
but
inviting
smell
taste
is
full
of
fruit
and
honey
up
front
with
a
nice
malted
bitter
finish
still
some
alcohol
on
the
palate
as
well
really
good
tasting
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
would
be
slightly
pass
prime
but
it
is
still
drinking
really
well
very
good
belgium
tripel
overall
an
amazing
beer
i
have
no
doubts
that
this
should
be
in
the
holy
trinity
of
tripels
must
try
this
if
you
havent
o
and
heres
the
reason
a
trip
to
belgium
is
on
my
bucket
list
besides
pairing
this
with
some
local
european
cuisine
id
love
to
have
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
maybe
even
fresher
complex
and
satisfying
beer
overall
very
good
i
think
this
beer
tends
to
be
sweeter
on
draft
but
seems
more
balanced
out
of
the
bottle
overall

it
has
taken
me
far
too
long
to
finally
try
this
one
a
world
class
standard
simple
as
that
i
used
the
glass
to
make
a
vigorous
pour
as
this
brew
is
well
carbonated
explosive
head
that
stays
and
stays
the
lack
of
copious
lace
is
the
only
knock
i
can
find
in
this
slightly
cloudy
golden
honey
colored
brews
appearance
there
is
some
due
to
the
goodly
carbonation
and
high
malt
content

lots
of

superb
very
well
balanced
with
honeyed
malt
and
mild
dinner
roll
sweetbread
a
bit
of
vinous
sourness
flows
into
an
artful
hop
combination
that
is
drying
and
delicately
bitter
finish
is
so
clean
and
dry
that
you
wind
up
drinking
this
like
a
lager
feel
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
finely
effervescent
and
and
creamy
this
beer
feels
lighter
than
it
is
and
it
makes
for
superb
drinkability
as
i
said
at
the
top
a
world
class
brew
that
set
the
standard
in
drinkability
for
tripels
and
is
really
in
a
class
by
itself
if
all
i
could
drink
was
tripels
this
would
probably
be
the
one
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
but
i
like
how
it
worked
when
it
is
below
freezing
outside
o
a
decent
tripel
i
usually
stay
away
from
green
bottles
ill
have
to
try
one
of
their
12oz
brown
bottles
to
see
how
this
compares
beautiful
sticky
fluffy
white
head
leaving
great
lacing
and
not
going
anywhere
the
aroma
coming
off
the
head
is

the

alone
just
lifts
you
up
off
your
feet
peaches
banana
clove
citrus

fresh
baked

best
smelling

you
ever
laid

there
some
clove
i
think
and
that
woman
even
though
she
smacked
you
upside
the
head
for
smelling
her
is
still
there
as
well
effervescent
mf
and
light
on
the
tongue
a
beautiful
beer
that
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
style
one
day
i
would
like
to
have
it
side
by
side
with
la
fin
du
munde
adn
wstmalle
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
was
a
good
choice
on
my
part
to
have
it
on
new
years
it
was
my
first
tripel
and
im
looking
forward
to
try
more
beer
of
this
style
just
a
fantastic
brew
my
new
favorite
notes
its
quite
the
sweet
beer
a
solid
malty
backbone
start
to
finish
very
tasty
cheers
o
a
good
triple
nothing
more
o
overall
the
smell
cant
overcome
the
shortcomings
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
certainly
drinkable
but
there
are
other
triples
i
would
try
beforehand
this
tripel
i
would
love
to
keep
around
but
i
have
not
found
it
out
side
a
bar
yet
loved
it
m
alcohol
is
not
disgusting
at
the
beginning
but
at
some
point
the
hops
and
alcohol
make
this
one
a
little
astringent
ending
is
very
long
a
massive
three
figer
head
with
the
consistency
of
dish
soap
bubbles
sits
atop
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
colored
body
even
though
the
head
eventually
dies
down
you
can
still
see
hundreds
of
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
to
hold
the
foam
cap
together
my
nose
is
greeted
with
hints
of
spicy
yeast
banannas
wheat
and
oats
to
produce
a
wonderful
bread
aroma
i
can
taste
a
definate
wheat
bread
body
with
a
mellow
bananna
flavor
and
a
spicy
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
at
first
thanks
to
the
nice
balance
of
carbonation
then
it
becomes
heavier
as
the
grains
and
yeast
form
a
bready
body
and
finishes
with
a
long
dry
spice
finish
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
classic
example
of
the
tripel
style
would
recommend
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
belgian
tripel
thebeeralmanac
com
i
had
a
chance
to
try
the
karmeliet
tripel
at
the
bank
in
wheaton
il
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yeast
filled
pale
yellow
or
straw
color
very
large
foamy
white
head
which
left
a
very
spotty
lace
due
to
the
fruity
precence
the
smell
is
sweet
yeast
esters
some
banana
some
pepper
honey
very
good
feel
is
light
lots
of
tingling
carbonation
taste
is
good
there
is
a
nice
dry
finish
i
get
sweet
honey
malts
a
little
hop
bite
some
peppery
aftertaste
along
with
the
dryness
overall
a
good
triple
my
favorite
tripel
a
beer
i
will
always
remember
seek
out
and
turn
to
o
this
is
a
great
tripel
it
is
very
drinkable
lightly
flavored
and
lightly
aromatic
it
is
really
refreshing
overall
thia
is
an
impressive
tripel
with
balance
and
great
characteristics
o
this
beer
is
near
perfect
it
could
easily
be
all
5
0
all
around
it
is
wonderful
and
delicious
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
regardless
of
what
their
beer
preference
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
lots
of
carbonation
tripel
karmeliet
i
am
not
one
to
by
20
four
packs
of
beer
but
after
a
year
of
exploring
beer
on
beer
advocate
i
was
puzzled
by
how
these
expensive
belgian
beers
could
have
thousands
of
reviews
and
sky
high
ratings
are
they
better
that
a
new
belgium
triple
what
is
the
fuss
so
i
sprung
for
a
four
pack
of
tripel
karmeliet
which
was
the
only
a
rated
tripel
i
could
locate
at
my
favorite
beverage
store
you
have
probably
tried
this
brew
so
you
know
the
body
is
cloudy
and
golden
in
hue
the
head
is
thick
and
billowy
laces
well
and
forms
wonderful
patterns
as
you
make
your
way
to
the
last
sip
the
aroma
is
bountiful
with
amazing
complexity
which
brings
me
to
the
flavor
or
should
i
say
experience
waves
of
everchanging
notes
wash
over
the
palate
all
of
those
adjectives
you
read
in
beer
reviews
well
you
can
actually
taste
in
this
brew
tree
ripe
apricot
light
dust
of
fresh
ground
cinnamon
spice
warm
homemade
bread
dough
lick
of
a
cement
trowel
in
the
tripel
karmeliet
these
adjectives
really
do
apply
now
i
get
it
but
is
it
beer
after
trying
many
brews
this
tripel
blows
you
away
with
the
complexity
of
flavors
and
leaves
you
in
wonderment
of
how
did
they
do
that
how
can
you
brew
beer
with
those
notes
but
really
the
karmeliet
does
not
taste
like
beer
does
it
i
would
not
serve
one
to
a
beer
lover
who
does
not
have
a
minimum
of
belgian
experience
or
heshe
will
think
i
just
added
fruit
juices
to
an
now
ruined
budweiser
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
tripel
nice
use
of
fruit
flavors
and
spices
that
complement
each
other
well
price
point
10
99750ml
bottle
overall
according
to
the
bosteels
website
the
name
tripel
karmeliet
thus
refers
both
to
its
origin
and
its
inbottle
fermentation
i
find
that
confusing
are
they
saying
that
it
actually
has
been
fermenting
twice
and
then
the
third
time
being
the
bottle
i
dunno
but
regardless
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
one
to
be
enjoyed
on
almost
any
occasion
i
love
the
complexity
and
sweeter
elements
to
help
distract
from
the
bitter
dryer
flavors
induced
by
the
grains
again
arguably
a
little
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
but
an
excellent
tripel
nonetheless
is
it
a
contradiction
for
something
to
be
really
subtle
yet
complex
at
the
same
time
because
thats
what
id
say
about
this
character
without
missing
refreshment
at
all
i
wish
i
could
get
this
ontap
locally
o
wonderfully
wellbalanced
and
delicious
beer
i
am
so
glad
i
found
a
fourpack
and
have
another
three
to
enjoy
and
savor
highly
recommend
this
beer
o
i
like
my
tripels
on
the
drier
spicier
side
and
this
fits
the
bill
very
drinkable
too
much
more
so
than
most
of
this
style
and
potency
this
would
make
a
great
holiday
dinner
beer
goes
down
crisp
and
clean
almost
like
a
normal
lager
very
easy
drinking
had
it
from
a
growler
and
paired
it
with
chicken
rice
and
squash
this
is
good
a
good
ballgame
watching
beer
as
much
as
it
pains
me
to
say
it
this
is
a
better
beer
than
la
fin
du
monde
this
is
good
stuff
this
is
what
a
triipel
should
be
would
certainly
drink
again
overall
impression
i
am
definitely
going
to
be
keeping
my
eyes
opened
for
this
one
in
stores
i
was
able
to
keep
a
good
tab
on
most
of
the
attributes
but
there
can
be
many
more
with
this
one
if
you
get
a
chance
go
for
it
this
one
is
a
flavorful
tripel
and
would
suggest
for
anyone
out
there
easy
drinking
too
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
is
lightly
spicey
with
hints
of
fruit
and
a
nice
bready
maltiness
to
it
the
flavor
follows
with
the
light
fruitiness
slightly
beating
out
the
light
spiciness
and
malty
backbone
this
has
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
overall
a
great
tripel
it
is
when
well
poured
of
cxourse
a
tough
of
soft
fluid
silk
that
fils
your
mouth
its
full
flavour
and
frechness
at
the
same
time
is
the
key
of
its
well
diserved
succes
here
in
belgium
where
they
have
regional
restrictions
on
the
amount
of
cafés
that
can
have
it
on
draught
it
is
a
staying
succes
cheers
tripel
karmeliet
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
yellow
the
clean
white
foam
billows
up
to
near
four
fingers
in
height
and
its
quite
a
while
before
its
faded
all
the
way
back
down
everything
looks
great
except
for
the
lacing
or
relative
lackthereof
the
nose
is
fruitier
than
i
typically
find
in
a
tripel
and
leans
more
towards
pear
than
a
menagerie
of
pale
fruits
theres
a
bit
of
a
phenolic
edge
to
the
aroma
as
well
with
some
clove
and
even
a
bit
of
coriander
standing
out
in
particular
the
sweetspicy
balance
is
just
a
little
off
for
me
though
the
malts
allow
some
more
room
for
granny
smith
apples
and
apricots
among
others
to
join
the
pears
in
the
fruity
open
to
the
flavor
profile
theres
also
a
honeylike
sweetness
that
weaves
in
around
the
fruits
and
manages
to
linger
for
just
an
extra
second
as
with
the
nose
the
phenolic
back
end
is
primarily
clove
and
coriander
though
the
clove
is
more
dominant
here
than
in
the
aroma
and
it
struggles
a
little
bit
to
come
through
against
the
sweetness
that
came
for
it
unsurprisingly
i
guess
given
my
above
quarrels
with
the
beer
i
find
the
body
to
be
a
little
bit
too
chewy
and
profound
the
carbonation
has
a
bit
of
pep
and
liveliness
to
it
but
i
imagine
if
it
didnt
have
to
cut
through
as
much
sweetness
it
would
really
pop
tripel
karmeliet
is
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
well
attenuated
as
most
of
the
tripels
ive
really
enjoyed
d
a
very
very
good
tripel
but
a
definite
notch
down
from
top
of
class
grouping
lots
of
good
things
going
on
but
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
in
all
categories
overall
a
very
tasty
tripel
and
true
to
the
style
light
fairly
alcoholic
with
some
spiciness
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
o
complex
and
lovely
well
crafted
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
fluffy
pleasant
overall
im
very
impressed
literally
a
dinner
rolled
up
in
a
beer
the
only
tripel
ive
had
thats
more
ridiculous
and
fascinating
than
this
is
unibroues
la
fin
du
monde
one
of
the
big
ones
responsible
into
getting
me
into
more
diverse
beers
despite
inconsistencies
in
the
recipe
its
still
a
beer
i
could
order
all
night
without
getting
tired
of
it
and
eventually
collapsing
on
the
floor
in
a
drunken
euphoria
o
such
a
great
tripel
so
well
balanced
sweet
straw
body
and
fruit
flavors
balance
with
the
tart
and
spicy
bitterness
alcohol
is
present
but
sits
so
well
behind
the
flavors
bubbly
clean
finish
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
but
im
going
for
the
750ml
next
time
o
love
it
big
and
complex
looks
fantastic
a
truly
world
class
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
again
im
just
not
picking
up
the
same
intensitycomplexity
on
the
palate
others
have
described
its
more
viscous
than
i
expected
but
it
works
wonderfully
with
the
slightly
prickly
carbonation
to
provide
a
smooth
creamy
experience
probably
my
favorite
tripel
at
the
moment
which
is
saying
quite
a
lot
as
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
drinkability
this
goes
down
soooo
well
one
of
the
best
tripels
out
there
excellent
overall
and
i
cant
recommend
it
enough
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
from
a
750
straw
yellow
color
with
a
good
inch
of
white
foam
smell
is
wheat
with
a
little
lemon
not
overwhelming
taste
is
very
smooth
and
balanced
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
a
little
citrus
maybe
no
alcohol
taste
which
is
pretty
outstanding
for
a
8
5
abv
nice
carbonation
great
medium
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
fluffy
and
sturdy
gold
with
a
pure
white
oneinch
head
that
stuck
around
for
longer
than
most
it
never
completely
dissipates
so
there
is
a
constant
quarterinch
of
creaminess
medium
amount
of
lacing
it
has
a
very
interesting
look
because
of
the
lasting
head
and
retention
aroma
is
crisp
wheat
and
banana
even
a
bit
grassy
i
catch
a
scent
similar
to
noble
hops
as
well
a
great
tasting
brew
that
is
crisp
and
wheaty
banana
citrusy
and
buttery
flavors
dominate
a
very
creamy
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
and
not
a
heavy
brew
at
all
for
8
4
abv
tripel
karmeliet
is
just
downright
quality
and
a
mastered
blend
of
grains
that
gives
you
one
of
the
best
tripels
on
earth
o
a
fairly
solid
tripel
pretty
good
flavors
albeit
a
bit
less
spicy
than
i
like
from
the
style
even
so
its
worth
a
try
o
very
good
example
of
the
style
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
flavorwise
initially
it
tastes
like
a
wheat
beer
crisp
and
dry
then
the
flavors
develop
and
it
becomes
sweet
and
creamy
with
a
nice
tart
fruityness
underneath
starting
about
midpalate
a
faint
champagnelike
dryness
starts
to
impede
and
carries
you
to
the
finish
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
the
sweetness
would
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
o
i
think
this
might
be
the
best
tripel
ive
had
really
a
great
beer
now
if
only
they
would
switch
to
dark
glass
o
delicious
best
with
saltyfatty
foods
like
munster
and
whole
wheat
crackers
t
this
is
a
really
great
tripel
lots
of
grassy
hop
flavor
and
earthy
malts
backed
up
by
some
subtle
spiciness
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
o
great
belgian
very
true
to
the
style
d
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
with
a
pleasant
medley
of
flavors
which
transition
well
d
nicely
done
the
malt
is
readily
apparent
but
it
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
spicy
yeast
and
musty
hops
o
solid
beer
that
likely
would
do
good
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
to
knock
down
this
oppressive
alcoholic
heat
on
the
tongue
time
to
go
buy
another
and
chuck
it
in
the
cellar
this
brew
poured
as
a
hazy
orange
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
it
had
a
pretty
good
lacing
also
the
smell
of
beligan
yeast
and
some
citrusy
aromas
were
heavy
in
this
one
the
taste
on
the
first
sip
was
a
bit
boozy
i
thought
as
i
drank
more
it
got
much
better
some
nice
yeasty
flavors
with
some
fruit
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
a
smooth
with
a
decent
carbonation
to
it
overall
the
i
thought
that
this
brew
was
very
nice
have
found
it
to
be
even
better
the
2nd
time
overall
a
very
solid
wellmade
representation
of
the
tripel
style
this
poured
a
goldenyellow
color
with
about
an
inch
of
white
head
which
dissipated
quickly
but
has
a
champagnelike
bubbliness
to
it
really
nice
looking
aroma
is
typical
for
a
tripel
belgian
yeast
spices
coriander
etc
taste
is
spicy
up
front
a
bready
belgian
yeast
taste
finish
the
carbonation
dances
on
your
tongue
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
id
say
you
can
get
better
at
the
bruery
but
good
for
sure
id
probably
pay
the
11
99
for
this
again
fuck
it
f
refreshing
complex
and
well
balanced
some
sweetness
spicy
and
very
delicated
bitterness
very
long
lasting
medium
light
body
throat
warming
overall
very
good
taste
not
terribly
interesting
but
not
at
all
boring
either
o
as
a
tripel
should
be
its
sweet
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
as
i
am
youll
enjoy
this
beer
especially
with
a
big
ol
plate
of
fish
n
chips
cheers
takes
the
bottle
version
and
shaves
off
all
the
rough
edges
frighteningly
drinkable
o
pretty
good
tripel
overall
but
i
really
think
a
realperson
bottle
would
help
it
its
a
reasonably
good
beer
that
should
definitely
be
protected
from
light
one
of
my
favorite
beers
sit
back
and
enjoy
o
a
pretty
great
tripel
the
alcohol
on
this
beer
is
done
extremely
well
a
very
drinkable
tripel
very
enjoyable
as
well
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
seen
and
enjoying
whenever
a
the
lightfruit
belgian
style
beckons
d
delicious
in
my
book
the
lightly
toasted
bread
and
grain
is
a
treat

a
hazy
yeast
filled
pale
yellow

color
very
large
foamy
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
to
a
thin
layer

some

some

dry
finish
i
get
sweet
honey
malts
a
little
hop
bite
some
peppery
aftertaste
along
with
the
dryness
overall
a
good
triple
but
it
aint
no
westmalle
tripel
o
a
wellbalanced
good
tasting
lightish
tripel
o
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
i
actaully
get
a
craving
for
this
specific
brew
at
least
once
a
month
overall
a
phenomenal
beer
and
one
of
the
best
tripels
out
there
o
very
drinkable
maybe
not
in
quantity
nice
balanced
yeast
character
overall
this
was
a
nice
experience
its
a
tripel
but
it
remains
me
of
a
belgian
wit
a
bit
this
one
pours
a
nice
gold
in
color
with
moderate
turbidity
and
a
one
finger
thin
and
very
well
carbonated
head
the
aromas
are
very
yeasty
and
it
is
full
of
citrus
overtones
damn
didnt
expect
so
much
orange
its
almost
like
seriously
faded
hops
it
smells
great
the
flavors
too
have
a
perfect
amount
of
yeast
and
spice
and
again
this
very
heavy
on
the
oranges
its
an
orange
and
coriander
bomb
tangerines
included
it
drinks
light
to
medium
in
body
and
is
very
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
tripel
everyone
knows
it
tell
your
friends
note
for
some
reason
im
finding
the
large
bottles
to
have
a
more
effervescent
body
and
lighter
taste
profile
unsure
of
what
might
be
causing
this
difference
o
excellently
delicious
overall
a
very
solid
triple
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
brewery
or
the
beer
for
that
matter
but
i
like
it
this
is
one
good
brew
again
just
because
it
smells
good
and
tastes
good
but
provides
my
palate
with
two
totally
different
experiences
bottoms
up
people
o
a
great
belgian
for
beginners
those
whove
experience
belgians
or
simply
an
old
fan
this
beer
was
great
and
dangerously
sessionable
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
to
get
all
over
belgium
i
dont
always
visit
craft
beer
places
while
im
here
my
wife
and
i
regularly
go
out
with
friends
and
always
stoked
to
see
either
westmalle
triple
or
karmeliet
triple
on
the
menu
i
am
pleased
with
karmeliet
not
top
of
the
line
d
fantastic
tripel
easily
one
of
my
favourites
one
of
the
most
well
balanced
beverages
ive
tasted
cheers
this
is
an
absolutely
exceptional
beer
the
best
tripel
i
have
ever
had
bar
none
overall
for
me
the
best
tripel
in
the
world
dark
amber
color
slightly
cloudy
with
smallish
head
and
good
lacing
complex
spicy
aromas
and
flavor
muted
hops
and
bitterness
nice
malt
backbone
somewhat
boozy
but
very
pleasant
flavor
yeasty
and
faintly
citrusy
carbonation
is
perfect
very
nice
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
despite
the
abv
which
may
get
you
into
a
bit
of
trouble
if
youre
not
careful
not
the
top
of
the
heap
but
close
overall
a
really
good
tripel
o
nice
appearance
to
this
good
tasting
tripel
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
great
tripel
but
nothing
about
it
makes
it
especially
remarkable
it
does
everything
well
but
lacks
a
unique
character
and
has
none
of
the
quirks
of
the
trappist
tripels
also
a
little
too
sweet
imho
nonetheless
in
my
top
10
in
this
style
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
the
highlight
poured
into
a
signature
stem
glass
an
amberhoney
color
hazy
with
a
huge
puff
of
foamy
white
head
that
almost
floats
right
out
of
the
glass
retains
well
and
leaves
some
delicate
lacing
aroma
is
full
of
spice
and
perfume
with
essences
of
fruit
light
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
a
cavalcade
of
flavors
herbs
and
floral
perfume
give
way
to
peach
pear
melons
orange
blossom
and
a
touch
of
banana
esters
with
a
ubiquitous
peppery
sensation
tasty
all
over
with
hints
of
its
relatively
high
alcohol
content
mediumbodied
complex
full
of
flavor
and
highly
drinkable
i
cant
believe
im
just
reviewing
this
for
the
first
time
this
is
a
phenomenal
tripel
and
a
phenomenal
beer
ive
had
better
tripels
but
this
is
quite
good
especially
for
the
price
love
it
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
low
carbed
maybe
that
kept
the
flavors
from
popping
i
hope
that
was
the
problem
hopefully
it
was
a
bad
pour
or
something
but
i
wasnt
impressed
overall
a
really
nice
trippel
kudos
to
the
dude
who
made
the
recommendation
dr
nice
drinkability
decent
quality
fair
price
give
her
a
spin
lads
o
decent
but
not
my
favorite
tripel
by
any
means
i
will
continue
to
keep
my
eyes
open
for
this
beer
though
and
will
hopefully
grab
a
fresher
one
for
comparison
if
i
come
across
it
o
this
is
a
great
belgian
beer
for
those
of
us
who
prefer
a
subtle
soft
flavor
go
for
the
750ml
though
way
more
economical
strongly
present
residual
malts
lead
the
way
in
the
taste
and
occur
mostly
midtongue
and
follow
thru
to
the
finish
dry
and
spicy
all
over
hop
character
was
very
balanced
as
well
as
a
very
balanced
hop
to
citrus
spice
a
nearly
perfect
feel
lends
much
favor
to
the
taste
and
drinkability
great
brew
could
have
enjoyed
many
more
that
night
if
i
wasnt
on
a
budget
very
nice
super
sweet
smooth
o
very
tasty
with
a
great
mouthfeel
extremely
easy
drinking
and
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
style
od
fantastic
brew
it
looks
great
and
the
smell
and
flavor
are
really
well
balanced
great
brew
to
drink
on
a
summer
evening
or
anytime
for
that
matter
it
does
a
great
job
of
showcasing
the
malts
and
yeast
the
light
hops
take
second
stage
and
back
them
up
very
well
i
will
drink
this
many
times
in
the
future
o
a
nice
tripel
its
well
balanced
and
pleasant
drinking
i
think
this
a
great
example
of
this
style
not
sure
if
the
carbonation
is
normally
this
high
but
thats
the
only
flaw
i
could
find
in
this
beer
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
overall
its
just
another
satisfying
tripel
to
be
had
all
around
a
solid
beer
i
was
happy
to
be
able
to
celebrate
with
a
tripel
of
that
caliber
o
this
is
terrific
it
is
beautiful
and
is
more
dynamic
than
most
tripels
the
only
thing
i
could
have
wished
for
is
a
little
bit
extra
mouthfeel
the
belgians
always
seem
to
like
their
beers
very
light
whilst
i
prefer
a
little
extra
body
well
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
perfect
beer
there
would
be
little
reason
to
continue
this
fantastic
hobby
would
there
o
a
superb
tripel
stands
among
the
best
lightmedium
body
with
a
smooth
feel
extremely
drinkable
d
heavyish
but
balanced
that
it
doesnt
leave
you
wanting
a
change
drinkabilityoverallyeah
perfect
just
perfect
goes
down
as
easy
as
anything
but
its
complexities
demand
it
be
sipped
i
cannot
get
enough
of
this
tripel
this
is
by
far
the
best
tripel
ive
ever
had
previously
i
counted
myself
as
a
dedicated
fan
of
dubbels
but
reserved
tripels
for
more
adventurous
risk
taking
moments
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
this
beer
just
changed
that
fantastic
overall
in
the
style
as
a
strong
effervescent
ale
with
restrained
alcohol
and
flavor
very
nicely
made
good
triple
glad
i
tried
but
may
only
get
once
in
a
while
wonderful
o
the
ourfuminess
is
what
makes
this
beer
a
little
much
on
the
palate
if
it
was
turned
down
a
few
notches
the
beer
would
be
a
lot
more
drinkable
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
i
think
this
particular
bar
may
have
an
old
tap
as
i
remember
this
being
more
carbonated
back
at
wurstkuche
in
la
the
lower
carbonation
did
not
seem
to
detract
much
from
a
solid
brew
taste
is
fruit
freshly
baked
bread
flowery
leaves
light
warming
alcohol
hint
it
has
gentle
subtle
complexity
giving
good
wellroundedness
and
depth
of
character
but
is
highly
drinkable
and
gentle
the
feel
is
soft
yet
lively
overall
this
is
an
excellent
ale
combing
great
complexity
with
high
drinkability
and
smoothness
mouthfeel
perfect
carbonation
floral
and
sweet
aftertaste
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
a
pretty
good
triple
overall
the
peppery
notes
are
fairly
unique
a
bid
yeasty
foe
me
for
gods
sake
dont
let
any
sediment
into
your
glass
whats
up
with
this
overall
shit
a
great
medium
to
light
beer
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
great
job
pours
a
very
golden
hazy
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
quite
some
time
head
is
beautiful
and
frothy
scent
is
a
little
funky
with
some
delightful
spiciness
and
fruity
aromas
nice
belgian
yeast
scent
linger
in
my
bruery
tulip
glass
with
hints
of
grass
and
green
apples
taste
is
initially
spicy
with
some
pepper
and
coriander
quickly
followed
by
delicious
belgian
yeast
flavors
then
i
get
some
grain
and
tasty
fruits
with
lots
of
green
apple
and
a
bit
of
lemon
finishes
nice
and
sweet
with
a
little
banana
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
dry
with
a
medium
body
drinkability
is
very
high
as
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
and
abv
is
well
hidden
overall
a
fantastic
take
on
this
difficult
complex
style
overall
a
top
notch
brew
for
the
style
ive
waited
too
long
to
try
it
and
now
need
to
have
it
again
definitely
a
benchmark
for
the
style
o
a
tasty
tripel
well
balanced
with
fruit
citrus
and
hops
an
easy
to
enjoy
o
a
little
dryer
than
some
but
is
a
good
tripel
will
definatly
seek
this
one
out
again
a
little
sweeter
than
i
like
love
the
fruit
character
though
peach
pear
syrup
hint
of
banana
light
spiciness
floral
and
grassy
dry
finish
but
outdone
by
sweet
body
some
alcohol
warming
in
the
finish
zippy
carb
hefty
body
not
as
refined
as
some
but
nice
character
o
4
5
goodness
cubed
not
tripled
a
little
brasher
than
the
fin
perhaps
but
the
dynamism
is
excellent
overall
a
nice
triple
its
balanced
pretty
good
just
wish
it
has
some
more
fruitness
to
it
easy
and
smooth
to
drink
almost
a
little
to
easy
i
like
my
triples
a
little
more
strong
and
citrus
influencd
la
fin
du
monde
is
a
perfect
example
this
is
soild
and
would
drink
again
tripel
karmeliet
is
very
dry
very
smooth
and
very
carbonated
swishing
around
the
mouth
really
brings
out
the
alcohol
but
its
just
the
right
amount
i
could
drink
this
beer
over
and
over
again
i
really
wasnt
expecting
anything
like
this
o
amazing
a
great
tripel
yes
there
is
better
but
they
are
few
and
far
between
i
am
seriously
considering
serving
this
for
the
toast
at
my
wedding
in
lieu
of
the
fiancees
ok
final
notes
one
heck
of
a
beer
and
it
would
be
even
better
if
they
didnt
package
it
in
those
damn
green
bottles
seriously
whats
up
with
those
sweet
and
fruity
would
be
a
great
champagne
substitute
i
love
it
a
solid
tripel
with
well
balanced
flavour
and
well
hidden
alcohol
a
delicious
beer
that
i
would
more
than
happily
have
again
one
of
the
more
hoppier
tripels
out
there
very
complex
flavors
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
on
tap
tripel
karmeliet
comes
in
a
really
nice
bottle
it
has
a
pale
orange
colour
and
a
big
head
that
lasts
the
smell
is
mostly
belgian
yeast
with
a
hint
of
cloves
the
taste
is
all
yeast
up
front
into
a
real
kick
of
alcohol
and
cloves
this
beer
has
a
very
intense
taste
but
i
dont
really
like
it
the
combination
of
cloves
and
alcohol
is
overpowering
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
nice
flavor
and
very
easy
to
drink
some
of
these
belgian
styles
are
becoming
among
my
favorites
very
drinkable
which
could
be
dangerous
at
8
4abv
i
found
myself
taking
a
lot
of
sips
exploring
the
flavors
and
it
was
gone
before
i
realized
and
left
me
wanting
another
a
great
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
cheers
d
very
tasty
and
refreshing
slightly
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
trip
but
still
a
solid
example
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
superior
tripel
tripel
karmeliet
was
pale
gold
in
color
and
hazy
it
had
a
towering
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
yeasty
with
pepper
clove
and
other
spices
the
taste
was
peppery
spices
upfront
followed
by
candi
sugar
light
malt
and
light
fruit
the
finish
was
long
dry
and
peppery
with
just
a
touch
of
noticeable
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
very
good
this
is
one
of
the
best
tripels
that
i
have
ever
tried
and
is
highly
recommended
dlove
this
beer
its
a
great
tripel
tastes
amazing
with
great
citrus
and
hopy
notes
would
get
this
on
a
nice
summer
or
fall
evening
poured
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
glass
a
golden
yellow
with
nice
carbonation
head
is
white
and
pillowy
three
fingers
that
sticks
around
a
long
time
smell
is
fantastic
spice
apple
pear
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
prevail
the
spice
definitely
has
the
edge
here
w
the
fruit
in
the
background
a
magnificent
smelling
beer
i
gotta
say
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
and
for
a
tripel
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
on
taste
everything
seems
to
be
in
perfect
harmony
it
seems
impossible
to
imagine
anything
different
here
mouthfeel
is
amazing
its
creamy
like
a
piece
of
sugary
angel
food
cake
w
fluffy
icing
the
abv
is
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
they
go
down
really
easy
although
i
always
try
to
sip
and
enjoy
these
truly
a
world
class
beer
drinkability
good
beer
i
think
the
tripel
is
well
done
and
a
definite
inclusion
in
my
rotation
despite
the
steep
price
for
a
four
pack
i
would
recommend
that
people
drink
this
beer
at
least
once
to
see
what
the
fuss
is
about
even
though
some
people
might
not
think
much
of
this
beer
as
special
i
can
definitely
say
that
the
tripel
has
taken
beer
drinking
in
a
whole
new
direction
cheers
d
the
overall
experience
is
bright
fresh
and
clean
this
is
an
older
bottle
and
i
have
had
even
more
tasty
presumably
fresher
examples
in
belgium
one
of
my
favorite
beers
because
of
its
swirling
complex
flavors
that
still
maintain
balance
brightness
and
drinkability
d
this
is
plain
good
stuff
decent
complexity
in
a
pleasant
warming
but
still
easy
drink
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
but
not
a
standout
beer
as
some
say
hands
down
one
for
the
best
tripels
ive
ever
had
id
like
to
see
how
it
compares
in
a
bottle
as
most
of
the
more
indepth
reviews
seem
to
come
from
a
bottle
tasting
d
slam
dunk
this
beer
would
be
enjoyable
in
almost
any
situation
i
could
relax
after
a
stressful
day
with
it
or
kick
a
couple
back
on
a
nice
evening
d
this
is
a
beer
to
sniff
sip
and
savor
one
in
any
given
session
is
plenty
for
me
a
great
example
of
the
belgian
tripel
style
the
8
abv
allows
you
to
drink
more
than
one
without
feeling
too
buzzed
a
great
belgian
tripel
d
wow
i
guess
thats
the
best
along
with
st
bernardus
abt
12
beer
i
have
ever
had
d
a
very
nice
belgian
tripel
i
thought
this
one
smelled
great
and
was
very
drinkable
would
love
to
have
again
sometime
d
light
beverage
that
goes
down
easily
due
to
creamy
body
and
refreshing
smell
and
taste
the
high
abv
could
get
one
in
trouble
with
how
fast
this
beer
may
be
consumed
dangerously
drinkable
to
me
a
good
tripel
tempts
you
to
gulp
rather
than
sip
even
though
you
know
better
this
one
goes
down
very
easy
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
looking
forward
to
having
it
again
soon
poured
from
a
bottle
the
beer
has
an
orangegold
color
with
a
slim
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
sparse
film
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
throughout
the
beer
lingering
well
into
the
drinking
phase
the
beer
has
aromas
of
butter
coriander
and
citrus
the
taste
is
largely
riding
on
a
sweet
foundation
again
with
buttery
notes
and
some
toffee
with
the
spices
coriander
and
nutmeg
balancing
out
and
allowing
the
slightest
hint
of
lemon
to
fade
in
and
out
the
beer
is
creamy
and
light
in
mouth
and
fades
to
a
semisweet
and
smooth
finish
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sweetness
to
the
aftertaste
with
none
of
the
spice
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
and
the
abv
doesnt
impede
or
encroach
on
any
of
the
flavors
well
balanced
a
solid
triple
that
i
wish
i
could
afford
a
hard
sell
a
20
a
four
pack
when
lfdm
6
for
a
750ml
still
even
at
the
price
its
a
must
try
overall
great
beer
in
my
humble
experience
of
belgian
imports
thanks
to
my
brother
ben
for
the
christmas
present
light
body
very
clean
creamy
and
smooth
perfectly
drinkable
fruity
and
clean
with
the
perfect
carbonation
the
cpj
served
up
too
cold
in
a
beautiful
branded
tulip
my
nose
was
excitedly
greeted
by
your
typical
clove
belgian
yeast
triplethreat
highly
drinkable
well
executed
with
a
high
abv
and
a
satisfyingly
charming
oldworld
sensibility
its
a
style
ive
recently
really
begun
to
enjoy
and
in
collaboration
with
a
nicely
charred
quite
tasty
burger
and
some
obligatory
beerbattered
fries
it
made
for
a
perfect
afternoon
lunch
this
will
eternally
have
a
place
on
my
beer
shelf
multiple
visits
have
yielded
multiple
interpretations
looking
forward
to
much
more
meetings
drinkability
i
am
glad
we
went
all
over
gatineau
to
track
this
down
just
upset
i
only
bought
one
great
beer
with
great
flavours
served
from
bottle
into
a
trappistes
rochefort
goblet
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
two
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
bread
banana
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bread
banana
dark
fruit
and
slight
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
excellent
brew
this
was
my
first
time
trying
this
one
and
i
can
now
see
why
it
is
listed
in
the
current
top
100
list
had
a
very
nicely
balanced
flavor
and
great
aroma
here
not
much
missing
at
all
in
either
aspect
really
glad
this
one
is
readily
available
in
my
area
on
tap
even
an
absolute
must
try
drink
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
ever
had
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
and
it
has
terrific
balance
however
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
a
night
d
man
i
looked
down
after
a
few
minutes
and
my
beer
was
over
half
gone
this
one
basically
drinks
itself
im
definitely
picking
up
the
gift
set
with
the
glass
check
this
one
out
this
is
a
seriously
under
appreciated
beer
that
can
stand
up
against
any
other
beer
of
the
style
what
can
i
say
these
beer
is
one
of
those
rare
ones
that
i
can
genuinely
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
as
someone
prone
to
darker
beers
i
found
this
one
to
be
surprisingly
good
the
appearance
wasnt
the
common
straight
piss
yellow
color
but
rather
a
cloudy
bright
yellow
the
taste
wasnt
bitter
at
all
and
i
found
it
quite
friendly
but
different
i
would
strongly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
and
i
look
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
again
drinkability
this
is
one
enjoyable
brew
bottom
line
ill
drink
this
again
d
super
easy
to
drink
as
most
belgians
had
this
on
tap
at
burp
castle
in
new
york
city
i
actually
hadnt
heard
of
this
beer
before
but
i
figure
they
have
a
good
beer
list
there
and
i
like
tripels
so
ill
just
go
for
it
pours
a
cloudy
orange
colour
with
tight
thin
white
head
lacing
around
some
of
the
glass
smells
of
saison
almost
with
the
belgian
yeast
and
some
spices
very
dry
flavour
not
as
sweet
as
many
tripels
high
carbonation
level
very
enjoyable
beer
id
be
glad
to
have
this
again
notes
an
unbelievably
tasty
beer
seriously
epic
and
decently
priced
d
dangerously
drinkable
because
of
how
the
alcohol
plays
into
the
taste
and
the
light
body
this
beer
will
knock
you
out
if
youre
not
careful
and
take
the
8
4
into
account
overall
impression
champagnelike
but
surprisingly
bland
for
the
aroma
and
appearance
i
recommend
this
over
some
other
better
known
belgium
trips
i
wont
mention
any
names
d
taste
and
smell
is
very
good
way
too
over
the
top
with
the
carbonation
less
carbonation
would
make
this
an
excellent
beer
d
i
bought
this
tripel
per
a
suggestion
of
a
fellow
beer
geek
who
i
randomly
met
binnys
in
buffalo
grove
n
burbs
of
chicago
he
said
you
like
belgians
and
tripels
you
need
to
try
this
one
this
is
quite
good
and
worth
trying
my
favourite
beer
i
could
sip
it
all
day
long
overall
an
very
good
example
of
belgiums
excellent
breweries
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
great
example
of
the
style
looks
just
like
it
should
feels
just
like
it
should
easy
drinking
despite
its
strength
nose
is
grassy
and
floral
with
some
nice
lemony
notes
spicy
too
refreshing
i
liked
it
a
lot
flavor
is
more
standard
as
far
as
tripels
go
nice
combo
of
malts
yeast
and
spices
to
give
an
overall
great
beer
very
clean
and
welldone
drinkability
is
very
good
its
got
a
sweet
and
tasty
bouquet
of
scents
and
flavors
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
just
about
no
alcohol
or
bitterness
in
the
taste
making
it
something
that
is
easily
and
readily
quaffable
ive
yet
to
meet
a
tripel
i
havent
enjoyed
and
this
offering
from
bosteels
isnt
changing
that
anytime
soon
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
well
the
beer
is
blended
with
such
complex
and
strong
competing
flavors
it
can
be
hard
to
find
a
nice
balance
this
however
is
not
the
case
here
we
are
left
with
a
final
product
that
is
immeasurably
clean
and
delicate
with
inseparable
undertones
which
are
robust
and
delicious
ive
had
tripel
karmeliet
several
times
and
its
been
delicious
each
and
every
one
of
them
i
dont
know
if
its
the
worlds
best
tripel
but
its
a
great
example
theres
really
not
any
criticism
to
constructively
dole
out
nothing
needs
to
be
changed
if
youre
looking
for
a
great
tripel
look
no
further
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
d
goes
down
very
smoothly
this
isnt
my
favorite
tripel
on
the
planet
but
its
a
damn
good
one
d
good
nice
beer
just
wish
the
flavor
pulled
through
more
smooth
mellow
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
drink
its
a
very
nice
beer
will
def
have
to
find
a
bomber
somewhere
of
this
quality
beer
outstanding
beware
the
8
4
because
this
is
highly
drinkable
as
good
of
a
tripel
as
ive
had
overall
it
deserved
all
that
it
deserves
really
a
great
and
light
an
highly
drinkable
beer
d
decent
drinakbility
but
either
its
a
way
old
keg
the
tap
lines
need
some
cleaning
or
its
just
not
the
same
as
the
bottle
possible
pour
sanitation
in
the
line
i
feel
but
my
friend
likes
it
more
than
the
bottle
and
stands
by
his
pour
hmm
prickly
but
full
mouthfeel
all
in
all
a
very
tasty
treat
easy
to
drink
or
sip
ill
have
another
please
d
about
as
drinkable
as
you
can
get
interesting
beer
seems
like
a
spicier
and
sweeter
version
of
the
chimay
white
i
like
it
a
lot
2nd
best
tripel
ive
had
next
to
of
course
chimay
white
its
a
bit
of
a
different
take
on
a
tripel
as
far
as
the
flavors
are
concerned
im
a
fan
of
it
though
they
work
very
well
and
this
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
the
palate
opens
with
a
pretty
big
fruity
sweetness
pears
and
peaches
being
right
in
the
forefront
along
with
a
melange
of
light
fruits
cotton
candy
a
little
citrus
some
floral
character
and
a
little
honey
despite
the
sweetness
this
is
very
light
on
the
palate
crisply
carbonated
and
rather
refreshing
some
crystallized
ginger
is
present
too
the
finish
is
rather
spectacular
long
lasting
with
flavors
of
light
fruits
a
light
hoppiness
and
a
little
sweetness
the
only
detraction
is
that
theres
a
light
splendalike
sweetness
present
excellent
stuff
this
is
one
of
the
better
tripels
there
is
d
probably
not
the
best
example
of
a
tripel
but
good
if
you
like
saisons
i
would
rather
drink
something
else
3
hands
down
the
best
tripel
i
have
had
just
a
wonderful
beer
and
maybe
the
best
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
must
try
d
lighter
than
most
tripels
and
wonderfully
easy
to
drink
very
balanced
and
easy
to
sip
on
not
my
favorite
but
a
great
example
of
the
style
verdict
very
good
worth
trying
but
not
elite
very
drinkable
brew
was
a
little
sweet
but
not
overpowering
for
a
tripel
d
not
bad
for
being
sweet
it
was
a
dark
goldenyellow
to
me
this
wasnt
a
beer
but
more
like
a
sweet
wine
wine
it
did
not
taste
like
a
tripel
at
all
great
stuff
one
the
best
beers
ive
had
to
date
i
can
drink
this
all
night
pours
a
clear
goldenyellow
under
a
large
frothy
snow
white
head
bright
perfumy
aromas
of
orange
peel
lemon
subtle
spices
honey
almost
doughy
yeast
and
pale
malt
more
phenolic
as
time
passes
peppery
fruity
flavors
spicy
with
a
lemony
tartness
and
honeylike
sweetness
medium
bodied
and
creamy
though
quite
effervescent
a
little
splash
of
alcohol
in
the
throat
nice
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
cant
use
any
words
better
than
that
there
are
a
couple
of
offflavors
that
bring
down
the
overall
package
and
the
high
abv
is
too
noticeable
for
the
lighter
flavor
profile
d
i
liked
this
beer
i
just
think
there
are
better
examples
out
there
by
far
this
is
also
a
super
expensive
beer
which
also
means
it
is
not
something
i
would
grab
normally
d
very
nice
i
went
in
with
no
preconceived
expectations
but
if
i
had
they
would
have
been
exceeded
i
am
sure
i
will
be
buying
more
and
this
tripel
is
highly
recommended
i
could
drink
this
beer
every
week
a
bit
banal
compared
to
other
belgian
tripels
i
have
had
but
still
worth
trying
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
big
frothy
head
the
smell
is
fragrant
and
flowery
like
cloves
the
hops
is
very
evident
the
taste
is
a
little
more
subtle
than
the
smell
a
slight
banana
and
yeast
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
a
sugarcane
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
or
thick
and
slightly
sticky
but
not
like
syrup
the
alcohol
is
there
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
this
beer
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
compares
well
to
other
tripels
i
could
drink
this
fairly
regularly
d
a
top
notch
tripel
that
ranks
right
up
there
with
my
favorite
st
bernardus
the
best
part
of
drinking
the
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
beer
combined
with
very
active
and
tight
carbonation
combines
to
create
an
exceptionally
creamy
beer
really
delicious
beer
thats
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
d
very
good
careful
strong
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
carbonation
being
high
drinkability
is
good
it
has
some
great
flavors
and
was
complex
and
balanced
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
and
a
very
good
beer
overall
one
of
my
favorites
i
recommened
it
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
for
the
abv
and
the
style
not
a
strong
note
of
booze
to
be
found
even
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
full
bodied
with
lighter
notes
as
it
goes
down
the
flavors
have
me
coming
back
and
really
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
d
really
good
it
is
slightly
sweeet
which
is
a
drawback
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
through
a
warming
effect
and
somewhat
in
flavor
but
this
tripel
drinks
quite
nicely
drinks
i
often
find
that
a
drinking
experience
is
improved
when
served
in
the
most
appropriate
glassware
and
its
hard
to
get
more
appropriate
than
the
glass
built
and
labeled
for
that
specific
beer
at
8
4
percent
alcohol
content
tripel
karmeliet
is
a
smooth
easydrinking
beverage
it
paired
incredibly
well
with
my
pear
and
walnut
salad
and
even
better
with
balsamic
purchased
a
single
small
bottle
at
whole
foods
for
4
49
poured
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
chalice
glad
i
finally
had
a
chance
to
use
it
huge
white
head
forms
in
the
glass
all
the
way
to
the
top
the
body
almost
had
a
neon
yellow
color
to
it
in
the
glass
made
for
this
beer
the
presentation
is
amazing
smell
has
nice
fruit
notes
to
it
like
bananas
and
some
cloves
taste
is
also
quite
good
this
beer
has
wonderful
flavors
of
fresh
apples
and
pears
there
is
also
a
musty
and
yeasty
flavor
undertone
that
i
really
enjoy
in
belgian
ales
the
mouthfeel
was
fresh
and
crisp
though
possibly
just
a
hair
thin
very
easy
beer
to
drink
as
it
was
smooth
and
light
and
the
abv
hidden
well
under
layers
of
flavor
a
great
tripel
to
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
d
great
for
a
triple
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
mfd
smooth
throughout
a
sessionable
tripel
pleasing
from
the
initial
taste
to
the
exhale
d
fairly
drinkable
for
the
higher
abv
refreshing
and
the
flavors
are
intresting
the
heat
takes
away
somewhat
the
cloying
nature
of
the
bubblegum
flavor
eventually
began
to
turn
me
off
from
this
still
glad
i
tried
it
probably
a
12
glass
would
be
enough
every
now
and
again
d
extremely
drinkable
the
8
4
is
only
noticeable
after
it
warms
slightly
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
d
has
become
my
new
go
to
belgian
beer
lately
just
a
great
beer
to
have
as
it
seems
to
hit
all
the
right
strides
for
drinking
several
of
them
in
one
sitting
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
one
id
have
again
which
is
good
since
i
bought
a
metric
buttload
of
em
im
not
too
sure
what
i
think
of
this
beer
i
feel
like
id
may
need
to
get
la
fin
de
monde
from
unibroue
and
compare
side
to
side
to
see
if
i
just
dont
like
tripels
in
general
because
i
remember
liking
that
beer
but
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
one
11
2oz
bottle
served
in
my
st
tulip
best
before
15ak
indicated
on
the
back

pours
a
pale
orangegold
with
a
semihazy
clarity
head
was
one
inch
loose
and
bright
white
and
quickly
dissipates
into
a
solid
sudsy
band
around
the
edges
and
a
thin
slick
of
foam
nose
reveals
essence
of
tangerines
candi
sugar
and
a
faint
herbal
presence
perhaps
cloves
taste
consistent
with
nose
perhaps
a
hint
of
syrup
reminiscent
of
canned
peaches
in
the
mix
with
just
a
kiss
of
hops
to
balance
out
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
carbonation
level
that
is
pleasant
and
consistent
from
start
to
finish
this
is
by
far
the
best
tasting
tripel
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
try
to
date
just
a
fabulous
beer
my
only
regret
is
having
not
tried
it
sooner
pours

brilliant
golden

about
a

yes
five
fingers
of

awesome
huge
yeasty

green

just
what
i
want
from

the
fruits

in
the

a
touch
of
belgian

slick

on

just
delicious
wow
that
is
very
tasty
i
cant
believe
it
has
taken
me
so
long
to
finally
get
to
this
beer
freshness
and
the
green
bottle
have
scared
me
away
multiple
times
yeast
is
really
active
in
the
flavor
and
throws
off
alot
of
cloves
and
melon
flavors
alcohol
is
there
but
it
seems
more
dialed
down
than
in
most
tripels
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
and
creamy
and
the
grain
presence
maintains
its
lightness
finish
is
dry
and
has
a
bitter
hop
and
alcohol
kick
highly
carbonated
a
bit
too
much
for
me
this
is
probably

5
favorite
tripels
nice
beer
d
really
nice
tripel
well
balanced
and
refreshing
d
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
had
the
alcohol
is
strong
but
still
plays
nice
and
enhances
the
lush
fruity
flavor
profile
ill
drink
it
any
season
of
the
year
though
i
still
love
fin
du
monde
poured
a
nice
straw
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
the
off
white
head
was
massive
and
pillowey
aroma
is
spicey
earthy
yeasty
and
tropical
with
maybe
the
slightest
skunk
tastes
similar
to
the
smell
but
the
banana
yeast
flavor
is
super
strong
alcohol
is
warming
to
the
tum
but
not
really
detectable
in
the
taste
a
really
nicely
spiced
tripel
that
towards
the
end
starts
to
get
a
little
cloying
feel
is
slick
but
slightly
thinner
than
medium
this
is
pretty
drinkable
d
pretty
pleasant
brew
the
carbonation
i
felt
was
a
bit
to
much
but
besides
that
it
was
nice
had
this
one
many
times
clear
yellow
pour
with
a
nice
lasting
head
awesome
nose
the
belgian
yeast
profile
is
amazing
alsomainly
banana
but
a
strong
underscent
of
citrus
specifically
lemon
both
of
which
you
find
in
the
taste
with
an
allso
pleasant
alcohol
sweetness
and
yeasty
flavors
the
kind
of
beer
you
dont
want
to
share
the
best
tripel

pours
a
lightly
hazed
golden
amber
color
with
nice
cap
of
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing

light
made
up
mostly
of
floral
and
herbal
notes
hints
of
banana
lemon
fresh
baked

and
yeast
taste
slightly
more
aggressive
than

good
solid
fresh

the
floral
and
herbal
qualities
mixed
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
bananan
highly
complex
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
slightly
dry
a
very
nice
beer
different
from
many
in
the
style
after
reviewing
i
read
the
other
reviews
and
think
that
the
beer
might
vary
mildly
batch
to
batch
maybe
its
the
yeast
it
doesnt
seem
like
its
hit
or
miss
but
hit
or
pretty
good
if
that
makes
sense
mediumbodied
with
a
good
carbonation
level
very
drinkable
taste
is
sweet
and
fresh
lots
of
yeasty
fruitiness
its
got
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
really
drinkable
alcohol
comes
out
a
bit
more
as
it
warms
this
is
the
first
of
the
style
that
i
have
roundly
not
enjoyed
overall
quite
disappointing
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
its
not
overrated
smooth
and
easy
for
how
strong
the
abv
is
the
color
was
a
hazy
straw
blond
aided
by
the
wheat
and
oats
if
i
were
taking
a
stab
at
it
there
was
a
substantially
striking
plump
white
head
the
aroma
was
fruity
slightly
citrus
like
with
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
and
flowers
the
flavors
were
nice
with
a
reserved
malt
character
almost
pasta
like
along
with
citrus
fruit
and
spice
that
strikes
me
a
touch
like
lemon
pepper
with
some
nice
hop
bitter
thrown
in
the
alcohol
is
wonderfully
deceiving
in
this
beer
spritely
active
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
pours
a
pale
creamy
light
golden
with
a
decentsized
white
head
and
some
good
lacing
smell
has
some
nose
belgian
esters
alongside
some
citrus
taste
is
similar
quite
smooth
and
nothing
terribly
intriguing
but
overall
quite
good
medium
body
with
some
nice
carbonation
and
a
bit
dry
very
well
done
overall
not
nearly
one
of
the
best
tripels
that
ive
had
but
still
a
solid
offering
i
didnt
think
this
beer
could
come
close
to
la
fin
du
monde
but
it
does
quite
a
complex
ale
with
so
many
flavours
its
easy
to
dissect
but
hard
to
convey
the
full
experience
definitely
one
to
try
sampled
this
at
the
atlantic
city
brewfest
not
too
long
ago
poured
a
goldenyellow
hue
with
a
finger
of
bright
white
good
retention
and
great
lacing
smelled
of
lemon
orange
sugar
coriander
clove
oak
banana
and
peel
the
taste
was
very
balanced
between
all
of
the
above
flavors
with
a
surprisingly
malty
backbone
midpalate
and
a
spicy
dry
citrus
finish
very
carbonated
and
a
little
on
the
thin
side
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
dangerously
drinkable
triple
d
an
excellent
sipping
beer
with
a
lovely
combination
of
tastes
all
in
all
i
figure
i
just
do
not
like
the
style
everything
i
have
tried
for
tripels
has
disappointed
me
i
hated
la
fin
du
monde
which
so
many
people
love
and
has
a
high
rating
on
ba
i
have
not
found
any
tripel
that
i
actually
enjoyed
so
this
just
not
be
my
style
if
you
do
not
like
tripels
than
avoid
otherwise
give
this
brew
a
chance
for
you
beer
is
medium
body
with
some
forward
and
midpalate
sweetness
very
nice
overall
finishes
a
little
dry
but
not
bad
some
sweet
malt
in
the
midpalate
with
some
fruit
esters
a
very
nice
beer
overall
a
good
tripel
and
ive
had
it
a
lot
my
first
triplel
and
still
my
favorite
use
the
appropriate
glassware
and
you
will
enjoy
every
aspect
of
this
beer
the
head
is
thick
and
has
a
complexity
all
its
own
you
will
pick
up
on
banana
and
vanilla
flavors
along
with
spices
that
make
this
drink
exceptionall
great
full
body
with
a
golden
slightly

the

this
is
quite
a
good
tripel
with
fantastic
traditional
characteristics
quite
tasty
and
again
a
deceiving
abv
taste
was
dry
and
sweet
filled
mouth
up
with
bubbles
this
was
too
carbonated
too
much
stuff
a
standard
american
hophead
wont
really
appreciate
just
a
weird
pharmacuetical
grade
astringency
was
what
i
took
away
from
this
creamy
and
fluffy
on
the
tongue
the
head
feels
like
whipped
topping
alcohol
even
while
the
beer
is
cold
cuts
the
tongue
coating
tastefully
and
leaves
a
very
smooth
warming
all
way
down
the
pipe
this
is
way
more
drinkable
than
it
should
be
though
a
little
more
crispness
to
match
that
carbonation
would
have
been
nice
more
please
sweet
but
not
overly
good
balance
not
your
runofthemill
tripel
i
like
the
different
fruit
tastes
its
complex
and
changing
the
whole
time
the
booze
taste
could
be
toned
down
but
wasnt
a
major
deterrent
d
drinkability
on
high
perhaps
a
little
too
much
so
and
since
i
hate
to
recork
this
awesome
brew
ive
been
forced
to
commit
to
it
and
a
solid
buzz
shall
follow
alcohol
is
deceptive
and
only
shows
itself
as
a
soft
flowery
pineappleish
haze
that
gets
lost
in
the
lilies
the
pleasant
flavor
and
insane
body
only
beckon
another
filled
glass
in
celebratory
fashion
for
todays
arrival
of
the
lil
black
puppy
who
at
the
moment
lies
sleeping
soundly
at
my
feet
heres
to
poopin
outside
cheers
excellent
tripel
albeit
sweeter
and
less
complex
than
other
tripels
but
truly
a
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
a
complex
and
quite
smooth
tripel
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
very
much
its
up
there
with
my
all
time
favorites
st
bernardus
tripel
and
koningshoven
tripel
drinkability
well
i
really
love
this
beer
im
not
blown
away
by
the
nose
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
of
it
is
near
perfection
hell
of
a
beer
drinkability
is
good
while
the
alcohol
has
a
slight
burn
on
the
nose
its
wellhidden
in
the
taste
drinkability
a
really
enjoyable
beer
that
has
some
great
flavor
and
drinks
really
well
for
8
4
abv
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
but
i
have
a
feeling
the
abv
would
catch
up
with
me
eventually
definitely
recommend
this
one
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
probably
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
its
not
too
sweet
but
stays
within
the
style
with
sweet
and
tart
flavors
a
true
classic
tripel
that
deserves
a
top
spot
in
the
category
well
done
i
will
no
doubt
enjoy
more
arrives
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
good
carbonation
aroma
is
bananas
cloves
and
that
nice
belgian
yeast
but
also
a
whiff
of
the
alcohol
the
taste
is
at
first
very
sweet
candies
sugar
and
bananas
but
then
the
alcohol
kind
of
burns
off
the
sweetness
making
this
a
great
sipper
of
a
tripel
i
think
this
stands
out
among
tripels
as
a
unique
version
very
well
crafted
with
the
haet
of
the
alcohol
mellowing
out
the
sweetness
of
the
yeast
jd
d
tastes
great
pairs
well
with
food
widely
palatable
a
very
good
beer
all
things
considered
the
oats
on
the
grain
bill
make
for
a
thicker
smoother
drink
than
most
tripels
the
relative
creaminess
does
right
by
the
beers
sweetness
as
far
as
tripels
go
this
one
has
good
drinkability
i
think
id
still
prefer
a
la
fin
du
monde
over
it
but
you
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
the
summertime
and
feel
sated
drinkability
i
find
this
to
be
an
above
average
tripel
but
there
are
several
others
i
prefer
in
the
style
i
would
not
turn
this
down
but
also
would
probably
not
get
this
again
dthis
is
so
sweet
it
is
tasty
but
just
too
sweet
the
nose
had
a
good
balance
that
was
missed
on
the
taste
too
much
sugar
but
hid
the
8
4
alcohol
summary
a
pretty
nice
example
of
a
tripel
peace
out
attractive
beer
once
poured
beautiful
head
that
settled
and
laced
very
well
great
hints
of
pepper
and
citrus
that
contrast
nicely
i
wish
it
was
slightly
less
carbonated
i
felt
lik
it
thinned
out
the
beer
and
lessened
my
enjoyment
of
it
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
robust
mouthfeel
other
than
that
truly
enjoyed
it
yummy
poured
ontap
at
the
pangea
cafe
at
just
below
room
temp
into
a
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
i
havent
had
this
one
before
and
havent
been
drinking
belgian
ales
lately
but
decided
to
treat
myself
brilliantly
clear
golden
yellow
in
color
and
great
head
formation
retention
and
lacing
bananas
orange
peel
and
coriander
on
the
nose
and
much
the
same
on
the
palate
not
really
complex
in
these
aspects
what
you
see
smell
taste
is
what
you
get
which
isnt
exactly
a
bad
thing
but
i
thought
if
there
was
anything
lacking
it
was
in
these
areas
just
medium
bodied
but
still
almost
syrupy
in
texture
i
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
for
a
number
of
reasons
relatively
low
carbonation
the
malt
is
very
sweet
but
very
light
the
presence
of
alcohol
is
nearly
undetectable
and
the
finish
is
surprisingly
clean
for
a
relatively
heavy
beer
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
really
didnt
enjoy
the
experience
i
would
rather
call
this
a
strong
golden
or
belgian
specialty
ill
stick
with
the
classic
tripels
my
second
favorite
tripel
after
la
fin
du
monde
superb
d
great
drinkability
if
it
wasnt
so
high
up
in
abv
then
again
for
a
tripel
this
really
shouldnt
be
surprising
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
d
a
fantastic
tripel
it
has
everything
one
should
expect
from
the
style
my
biggest
problems
with
tripels
have
been
over
carbonation
or
being
too
spicy
with
clove
or
whatnot
however
this
one
has
everything
in
its
place
is
balanced
wonderfully
a
definitive
example
of
the
style
not
to
mention
one
of
its
best
in
my
opinion
another
big
tripel
with
plenty
of
character
that
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
no
wonder
its
rated
by
many
as
one
of
the
best
i
have
to
agree
as
it
is
my
favourite
tripel
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
great
and
the
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
it
was
also
very
cool
to
hear
how
this
beer
came
about
from
the
brewery
rep
nice
effervesence
in
the
mouth
it
is
a
great
beer
for
one
or
two
but
i
couldnt
have
a
karmaliet
session
d
i
was
almost
able
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
without
feeling
like
i
can
drink
this
whole
bottle
without
sharing
it
the
abv
is
just
on
the
border
of
dont
try
to
drink
this
whole
thing
on
your
own
otherwise
very
drinkable
the
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
since
its
so
well
blended
but
i
couldnt
get
tired
of
this
taste
could
have
a
few
pints
im
not
too
sure
what
i
think
of
this
beer
i
feel
like
id
need
to
revisit
it
a
few
times
my
first
impression
is
a
good
one
however
id
love
to
come
back
to
this
one
i
find
the
herbal
quality
to
be
super
interesting
never
having
come
across
it
before
in
a
beer
definitely
not
sessionable
but
im
not
having
any
trouble
with
this
bottle
out
of
tripel
karmeliet
and
duvel
id
say
it
should
be
this
one
getting
all
the
love
much
more
interesting
overall
impression
it
was
my
3rd
beer
of
the
night
and
my
favorite
of
the
three
i
had
3
of
them
yummy
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
lots
of
body
and
a
good
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
the
high
alcohol
comes
across
quickly
on
the
palate
but
then
the
malts
and
esters
catch
up
giving
this
an
almost
champagne
dryness
d
excellent
so
good
4
5
one
of
the
better
triples
shared
a
75cl
corker
with
my
brother
in
law
some
serious
head
took
about
a
gazillion
years
to
get
it
under
control
a
little
more
yellow
in
color
than
i
expected
in
a
tripel
nice
smell
a
little
fruity
to
my
olfactory
bulbs
great
tasting
hides
the
etoh
dangerously
well
could
see
this
one
sneaking
up
on
you
the
real
cool
part
about
it
is
somebody
gave
it
to
me
d
the
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
overpowering
better
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
the
ester
flavors
very
crisp
and
scrubbing
carbonation
i
think
it
keeps
the
feel
a
lot
lighter
than
what
it
would
be
otherwise
the
three
different
grains
wheat
oats
and
barley
creates
a
smooth
body
the
8
4
abv
is
smooth
and
does
not
seem
so
high
d
pretty
easy
to
enjoy
at
any
point
in
the
night
or
the
day
for
that
matter
i
really
should
drink
this
more
often
the
taste
was
so
smooth
and
wonderful
it
perfectly
melded
the
malt
and
citrus
taste
together
i
want
to
say
it
had
a
slight
pear
taste
to
it
but
im
horrible
at
picking
out
specific
flavors
either
way
i
greatly
enjoyed
it
d
drinkability
is
good
but
not
so
good
that
it
inspired
any
sort
of
creativity
in
my
description
here
solid
brew
d
not
bad
this
is
a
proper
flavourful
belgian
tripel
but
i
think
chimay
white
is
more
drinkable
if
youre
looking
for
something
you
could
enjoy
more
of
this
is
my
favorites
of
the
belgain
tripels
i
have
tasted
sweet
and
very
balanced
d
other
than
that
upfront
kick
in
the
head
i
could
drink
it
forever
and
a
day
d
this
is
probably
more
drinkable
than
alot
of
tripels
ive
tried
its
easy
on
the
palate
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
very
nice
beer
11
2
oz
slender
belgian
bottle
with
07h1
on
the
back
label
brewed
with
barley
wheat
and
oats
the
damn
bottle
volcanoed
on
me
but
i
still
got
a
decent
pour
the
beer
is
bright
gold
fairly
clear
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
that
clings
but
contributes
little
lacing
honey
spicy
yeast
and
a
dash
of
pilsner
malt
in
the
nose
a
little
sharp
on
the
palate
but
there
are
notes
of
orange
honey
alcohol
spicy
yeast
and
a
light
but
roughedged
hop
flavor
on
top
of
a
light
creamy
highlycarbonated
body
that
brings
some
warmth
on
the
way
down
nice
and
drinkable
but
this
tripel
could
be
a
bit
smoother
drinkability
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
but
just
kind
of
bland
and
with
so
many
other
great
belgian
triples
out
there
no
reason
to
settle
for
just
mediocre
again
wont
offend
you
in
anyway
but
nothing
you
would
come
running
back
for
d
classic
belgian
sample
tasty
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
beautiful
belgianstyle
head
on
top
lots
of
lovely
frothy
foam
smell
of
sweet
citrus
and
jasmine
tones
also
some
smells
of
cardamom
and
coriander
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
with
lots
of
fruit
and
some
honey
which
gives
a
great
contrast
with
the
spices
very
smooth
and
bubbly
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
the
beer
poured
a
very
clear
strawyellow
with
a
thin
white
creamy
head
into
a
chalice
the
smell
was
of
bubble
gum
banana
cloves
with
a
slight
floral
undertone
the
taste
was
the
previously
mentioned
unmistakable
belgian
yeast
profile
with
a
slightly
harsh
hop
bite
at
the
finish
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
perfect
carbonation
and
lacing
down
the
glass
a
very
nice
tripel
with
the
high
abv
nicely
masked
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
brewers
art
ozzy
i
need
to
buy
another
one
and
review
it
interrupted
by
family
a
bit
and
this
beer
was
a
little
past
the
best
by
date
i
have
just
checked
and
gave
the
st
bernardus
tripel
a
lower
score
so
may
have
to
revisit
that
but
this
is
so
good
a
must
have
ospicy
and
floral
very
good
unique
d
very
impressive
beer
with
quite
the
presentation
looks
lovely
in
a
belgian
tulip
glass
notes
good
mix
of
sweet
and
creamy
with
some
spice
and
alcohol
to
cut
it
really
nice
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
finishes
dry
i
look
forward
to
having
another
some
day
this
will
not
replace
st
bernardus
tripel
as
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
i
am
certainly
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
i
would
buy
it
again
d
a
very
nice
tripel
indeed
i
was
through
my
little
bottle
in
a
flash
an
excellent
pickup
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
luxurious
very
light
leaving
me
wanting
another
drink
this
beer
goes
down
well
this
experience
would
have
been
close
to
flawless
if
only
i
was
enjoying
this
beer
over
a
leg
of
lamb
meal
with
roasted
potatoes
d
a
tasty
tripel
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
pleasant
enough
tripel
the
high
booze
quotient
at
least
tempered
by
the
various
ok
3
malt
inputs
as
well
as
the
particularly
active
yeast
decent
but
exhibiting
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
heat
to
be
considered
all
that
drinkable
though
it
will
likely
steel
me
for
the
stroll
back
to
my
hotel
on
a
soso
toronto
midlate
winter
evening
drinkability
i
like
it
if
you
like
tripels
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
worth
a
try
a
very
appropriately
thin
body
impressive
considering
the
high
abv
bubbly
and
light
making
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
tripel
karmeliet
is
a
slightly
hazy
and
very
sparkling
pale
yellow
ale
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
that
has
great
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
doughy
and
fruity
aroma
with
notes
of
banana
pear
apple
peach
cherry
nutmeg
and
clove
its
light
bodied
and
very
lively
it
foams
on
the
tongue
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
its
perhaps
a
touch
sweet
with
a
barely
detectable
bitterness
it
tastes
very
fruity
almost
ciderlike
all
of
the
fruit
present
in
the
aroma
is
in
the
flavor
there
is
perhaps
some
bret
at
the
finish
this
comes
off
as
pretty
light
fare
but
its
pretty
complex
its
very
refreshing
i
was
shocked
when
i
read
the
abv
later
750
ml
green
corked
bottle
served
in
a
chalice
glass
golden
colour
with
a
bit
of
haziness
and
quite
a
good
head
that
leaves
a
crown
and
lace
malty
aroma
of
fruits
honey
some
spice
vanilla
orange
peel
sweet
silky
and
liquor
like
flavour
taste
of
honey
oranges
banana
maybe
apricot
coriander
both
smell
and
taste
have
everything
so
subtle
and
integrated
that
is
hard
to
tell
exactly
what
anything
is
and
that
can
be
good
and
bad
at
the
same
time
great
really
great
stuff
sweet
i
always
come
back
to
this
beer
esp
when
i
find
it
on
tap
in
colorado
appearance
is
the
characteristic
tripel
golden
nose
is
sun
screen
hops
pears
raisins
flavor
adds
more
hoppiness
and
a
hint
of
blueberries
ending
with
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
alcohol
is
reasonably
well
hidden
a
delightful
beer
not
unlike
the
leffe
blonde
o
excellent
drinkability
a
belgian
masterpiece
mandatory
to
belgian
ale
lovers
tasty
and
good
i
do
like
a
good
tripel
and
this
is
one
that
goes
down
pretty
easy
d
this
style
is
not
always
up
my
alley
but
this
is
a
great
representation
of
this
style
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
if
you
like
belgians
or
trippels
most
likely
you
have
had
this
already
if
not
it
is
a
must
try
has
an
excellent
balance
of
fruit
sweetness
and
malt
starts
out
sweet
but
finishes
dry
very
nice
effort
the
label
says
triple
but
my
mouth
says
session
great
drinkability
especially
for
a
beer
over
8
almost
as
quaffable
as
a
saison
and
more
complex
awesome
beer
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
i
have
many
d
i
dont
know
about
this
one
its
certainly
a
nice
tripel
but
its
not
very
complex
or
dynamic
you
drink
it
flavor
hits
the
tongue
and
its
gone
nothing
really
gives
it
much
to
get
you
interested
in
drinking
a
lot
more
creamy
spicy
flavors
are
also
quite
fruity
and
even
if
the
origin
of
these
remains
difficult
to
identify
it
reveals
however
the
apricot
the
beer
is
made
with
barley
wheat
and
oats
each
grain
is
taken
once
believed
once
malted
and
is
very
warm
and
contains
little
bitterness
the
flavor
is
mild
and
sweet
with
a
finish
reminiscent
of
quinine
it
is
less
sweet
and
more
balanced
than
the
pressure
bottle
and
she
appears
much
more
refreshing
even
if
it
is
full
of
flavors
complex
beer
330ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
clear
copper
color
with
a
huge
longlasting
white
head
sweet
aroma
of
yeast
and
fruits
complex
malt
flavors
with
more
yeast
citrus
and
spices
sweeter
than
most
tripels
but
not
too
sweet
alchohol
isnt
noticible
at
all
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
beer
pours
golden
with
a
huge
white
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
belgian
wheat
and
fruit
very
inviting
the
flavor
is
very
similar
with
lots
of
lemon
and
other
citrus
dominating
you
also
get
the
belgian
yeast
and
malt
character
you
expect
from
a
worldclass
tripel
the
beer
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
is
very
carbonated
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
luscious
and
soft
amount
of
carbonation
mouthfeeldrinkability
aside
from
the
initial
overlyexcited
burst
of
efferevescence
the
texture
is
soft
and
full
with
a
mouthfilling
presence
that
reaches
all
areas
of
the
tasting
spectrum
an
absolute
classic
in
the
art
of
belgian
brewing
this
is
the
one
beer
i
will
support
and
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
the
best
of
the
best
mk
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
well
down
and
i
could
easily
drink
more
the
mf
is
amazing
good
drinkability
as
well
drinkability
this
is
just
one
fantastic
beer
tripels
are
usually
good
at
hiding
their
nuclear
abv
and
tripel
karmeliet
is
no
exception
throw
in
the
amazing
flavor
and
this
is
an
experience
i
cant
wait
to
repeat
this
could
possibly
be
the
best
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
enjoy
very
drinkable
even
at
8
abv
sat
aroung
in
the
evening
with
friends
sipping
purchased
a
750
ml
bottle
at
flannerys
ii
in
oconomowoc
wi
poured
into
my
new
tripel
karmeliet
goblet
this
beer
shows
a
golden
straw
body
with
an
enormous
puffy
white
head
aroma
is
of
yeasty
lemon
peel
and
sparkling
wine
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
very
carbonated
spicy
yeast
esters
are
the
initial
flavors
even
with
all
the
bubbles
the
wheat
and
oats
give
it
a
smooth
finish
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
this
is
good
out
of
the
bottle
but
i
think
its
better
on
tap
lots
of
personality
yet
not
at
all
overbearing
among
the
best
of
the
lighter
tripels
overall
a
treat
to
embibe
in
strong
and
great
as
a
night
cap
pours
a
cloudy
dark
maize
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
spice
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
earthy
malt
slight
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
wheat
fits
the
style
of
a
tripel
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
citrus
yeast
slight
spice
slight
hops
some
sweet
malt
alcohol
and
slight
pale
malt
overall
well
blended
theres
a
good
body
and
nice
aroma
good
stuff
cheers
d
a
solid
tripel
good
benchmark
for
the
style
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
drinkabilty
rather
good
d
pretty
good
i
think
the
large
amount
of
bubbles
in
it
kill
it
a
bit
so
i
had
to
let
it
sit
out
for
quite
a
while
strong
presence
of
belgian
yeast
throughout
but
had
a
really
nice
oaky
finish
that
you
get
from
an
excellent
chardonnay
finishes
like
a
crisp
apple
cider
doughnut
excellent
and
round
really
delicious
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
tripel
perhaps
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
its
a
very
refreshing
example
of
the
style
good
complex
brew
that
i
would
highly
recommend
thanks
to
zorprime
for
this
worldclass
bottle
d
a
tad
too
strong
and
flowery
to
drink
all
night
but
a
great
beer
to
introduce
some
one
to
the
style
poured
this
beer
from
bottle
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
poor
presentation
from
a
fine
steak
house
but
i
did
mention
this
to
the
bar
maid
who
offered
to
correct
it
smell
was
not
much
to
consider
but
there
was
a
swirling
of
other
smells
in
the
restaurant
what
i
could
make
out
of
the
smells
were
full
of
nice
mellow
fruits
apricots
raisins
color
was
dark
golden
with
a
wheat
cloudiness
to
it
that
was
inviting
full
fine
head
that
was
a
slight
eggshell
off
white
but
it
faded
right
away
and
the
lacing
was
ruined
by
the
chilled
glass
beer
was
very
drinkable
with
good
carbonation
and
sweetness
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
that
was
very
pleasing
beer
was
representative
of
the
style
and
full
of
flavor
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
although
there
are
better
represenations
of
the
style
dont
hesitate
to
buy
it
if
you
see
one
well
preserved
perhaps
this
one
could
use
a
bit
more
aging
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellowgold
huge
fluffy
white
head
forms
nice
lace
good
retention
smell
is
sweet
grainy
some
orange
spices
wheat
little
yeasty
taste
is
sweet
orange
and
spice
again
yeast
some
alcohol
and
a
wheat
dryness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
a
decent
tripel
but
too
sweet
for
me
i
dont
think
it
should
be
as
high
as
it
is
but
enjoyable
medium
body
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
initial
appearance
is
beautiful
but
the
carbonation
seemed
overdone
at
first
glance
however
the
mouthfeel
is
not
fizzy
or
in
any
way
bothersome
so
turns
out
this
wasnt
an
issue
at
all
overall
a
great
reprsentation
of
the
style
d
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
could
definitely
drink
more
drinkability
the
perfect
tripel
not
too
much
bubbly
malty
slightly
sweet
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
smooth
with
several
distinctive
flavours
a
perfect
beer
for
before
during
and
after
meals
magnificent
this
beer
was
pretty
good
it
reminded
me
very
much
of
leffe
blonde
it
had
a
pretty
good
head
and
was
light
gold
in
color
it
was
a
bit
honeysweet
with
hints
of
citrus
at
times
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
i
didnt
drink
it
with
food
so
im
curious
to
see
how
it
would
pair
with
a
meal
although
something
tells
me
it
makes
a
better
aftermeal
drink
this
beer
was
great
the
more
styles
i
drink
the
more
beers
i
find
that
make
me
wonder
how
i
ever
lived
without
them
i
will
categorize
this
beer
under
special
session
it
is
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
be
easy
though
its
8
4abv
but
i
think
ill
save
it
up
for
those
nice
summer
lobster
dinners
this
has
the
great
taste
and
character
of
a
wheat
beer
as
it
leaves
the
palate
but
it
is
not
as
heavy
on
the
palate
or
too
much
of
a
bully
in
the
taste
department
i
could
really
drink
this
year
round
because
of
its
subtle
but
fantastic
taste
it
has
a
very
short
light
and
crisp
finish
which
i
think
can
allow
it
to
be
paired
pretty
well
with
light
summer
meals
as
it
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
this
is
white
wines
summer
replacement
drinkability
balanced
alcohol
barely
noticeable
any
price
is
a
good
price
for
this
gem
but
most
important
of
all
this
a
beer
that
is
not
only
true
to
style
but
also
transcends
it
unique
mfd
the
feel
is
perfect
what
can
i
say
great
amounts
of
small
scale
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
smooth
creamy
mouthcoating
this
beer
is
the
perfect
embodiment
of
these
characteristics
the
carbonation
goes
down
so
well
for
its
abundance
it
is
quite
hard
to
believe
d
for
8
abv
this
beer
is
wonderfully
easy
to
drink
generally
prefer
doubles
over
triples
so
tk
extra
sweetness
is
a
bonus
to
me
help
cut
through
the
dry
herbal
notes
that
dominate
other
triples
sweet
fruity
and
somewhat
simple
in
flavor
though
surely
not
cloying
in
its
sweetness
flavor
like
the
nose
is
simple
and
straightforward
though
quite
pleasant
offers
a
moderate
feel
and
a
light
sweetness
that
masks
the
abv
quite
well
and
along
with
the
general
lightness
of
the
beer
affords
an
impressive
drinkability
again
improves
with
exposure
a
bit
unique
but
quite
nice
id
warm
this
beer
up
to
55
degrees
or
so
prior
to
opening
and
pouring
very
carefully
at
that
point
nice
easy
drinking
brew
i
like
it
d
very
smooth
and
complex
definitely
need
to
taste
more
than
one
you
can
tell
the
evolution
between
the
two
wow
a
gentle
pour
of
this
beer
produces
a
healthy
rising
two
finger
head
which
is
a
pale
see
thru
tawny
yellow
colour
with
really
beautiful
carbonation
with
the
head
slowly
slumping
to
a
big
ball
of
froth
in
the
middle
with
heaps
of
lacingthe
aromas
are
really
pleasant
notes
of
banannayeasty
breadwhite
grapes
and
some
peaches
soaked
in
alcoholit
has
a
nice
weighty
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
taste
of
apples
first
then
some
yeasty
malt
notes
which
finishes
with
a
subtle
stonefruity
finish
and
only
a
touch
of
alcohol
is
present
on
first
taste
but
after
that
not
really
noticeable
at
all
quite
an
easy
drinking
tripel
that
could
drink
abit
of
d
well
to
be
honest
i
never
expected
that
i
would
like
a
tripel
this
much
and
im
even
more
surprised
by
my
own
rating
should
maybe
expand
my
tripel
tasting
full
mouthfeel
with
a
strong
carbonation
which
makes
the
beer
unbalanced
wow
i
was
not
expecting
this
beer
to
be
this
exceptional
ill
definitely
be
back
for
more
d
a
little
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
and
a
little
strong
but
still
a
very
tasty
beer
if
this
were
available
in
a
party
setting
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
night
which
would
be
a
waste
of
a
very
fine
beer
highly
recommended
i
have
to
say
i
just
had
a
bottle
of
it
and
it
wasnt
nearly
as
good
it
has
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
to
it
i
havent
yet
figured
out
the
reason
for
this
off
taste
in
beer
but
its
annoying
to
get
a
beer
that
i
know
is
really
good
with
off
tastes
i
dont
think
this
is
my
new
favorite
tripel
but
its
very
good
md
slightly
syrupy
but
still
light
wispy
but
abundant
carbonation
this
beer
slips
its
way
over
your
pallet
effortlessly
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
and
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
great
drinkability
a
real
asskicker
in
that
you
can
down
gallons
of
this
stuff
and
not
realize
it
packs
an
8
4
wallop
one
of
my
perennial
favorites
cheers
to
belgian
triples
and
cheers
to
taps
notes
this
is
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
satisfying
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
tripels
i
have
yet
to
sample
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
well
carbonated
nose
is
quite
strong
lots
of
alcohols
and
sweetness
going
on
taste
is
pretty
funky
like
a
mix
of
whiskey
and
beer
minimal
body
but
alcohols
dominate
with
a
sickly
sweetness
not
anywhere
near
my
favorite
tripel
but
id
try
it
again
elsewhere
to
confirm
dvery
enjoyable
would
buy
this
again
this
is
a
complex
tripel
with
a
lot
going
on
that
i
would
very
much
like
to
reevaluate
in
the
future
d
plenty
drinkable
would
be
a
great
intro
beer
for
bmc
to
importscraft
when
it
comes
to
the
alcohol
nice
with
a
meal
or
as
a
treat
alone
pours
golden
with
quite
possibly
the
biggest
head
ive
seen
very
bubbly
strong
aroma
of
yeast
malts
citrus
flavor
of
orange
peel
malt
and
spice
nicely
balanced
and
a
good
mouth
feel
finish
remains
balanced
between
sweet
and
bitter
very
nice
beer
overall
im
far
from
experienced
in
belgian
tripels
but
this
gives
reason
to
try
a
few
more
karmeliet
came
to
me
in
a
tulip
glass
with
not
much
in
terms
of
head
a
small
white
cap
barely
covered
the
surface
small
streaks
of
lace
the
liquid
is
light
brownbronze
in
color
the
smell
is
that
of
a
refined
triple
alot
of
fruits
and
dark
sugars
candi
with
bubblegum
as
well
sweet
but
not
a
sweet
mess
the
taste
is
of
the
same
ilk
with
dark
fruits
guided
by
a
backdrop
of
candi
sweetness
residual
sugars
getting
some
banana
plus
spices
as
well
hops
dont
even
try
to
make
a
dent
the
high
abv
also
does
not
come
into
play
the
feel
was
great
with
a
above
medium
smoothness
with
perfect
carbonation
not
rough
at
all
goes
down
with
ease
i
could
have
drank
another
i
will
be
visiting
this
in
the
future
again
the
tatse
is
surpisingly
sweet
with
notes
of
fruit
and
hops
a
classic
among
tripels
this
will
be
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
poured
rigorously
with
some
of
the
sediment
added
for
extra
flavor
appearance
was
a
murky
orange
with
not
as
much
heading
as
when
served
on
tap
big
nose
of
peppery
alcohol
peaches
pears
bread
and
more
fruit
some
musty
medicinal
flavors
come
through
with
some
hop
and
grain
bite
still
with
plenty
of
fruit
to
go
around
prickly
carbonation
makes
it
rather
refreshing
for
a
beer
of
this
weight
drinking
this
one
is
easy
this
is
one
of
the
best
tripels
out
there
imo
possibly
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
i
suggest
putting
this
up
against
some
kind
of
creamy
cheese
humboldt
fog
as
usual
did
not
fail
to
make
a
lovely
accompaniment
cheers
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
foamy
2
finger
head
with
poor
retention
the
aroma
is
not
very
strong
smell
is
assorted
fruit
and
cloves
the
taste
is
sweet
with
phenols
present
this
beer
is
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
better
than
expected
given
that
the
aroma
was
not
very
strong
the
alcohol
is
also
well
hidden
i
would
not
have
guessed
that
the
alcohol
was
as
high
as
8
4
i
resolve
that
this
particular
batch
of
beer
was
left
in
the
fermenter
too
long
and
i
intend
to
rereview
at
some
point
given
the
high
ratings
from
other
bas
another
sublime
tripel
right
up
there
with
st
bernardus
tripel
and
la
fin
du
monde
in
my
book
high
drinkability
d
very
drinkable
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
if
that
can
be
a
complaint
definitely
would
recommend
to
others
especially
for
those
looking
for
a
summery
belgian
ale
with
some
kick
a
beer
to
try
if
you
like
belgians
particularly
tripels
drinkability
awesome
triple
a
new
staple
for
my
collection
d
very
enjoyable
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
great
drinkability
well
i
made
it
through
the
whole
25
4
oz
bottle
thats
all
i
would
ever
want
typical
for
a
big
beer
like
this
at
8
4
abv
oh
my
ive
had
a
number
of
chances
to
try
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
until
a
latenight
run
at
total
wine
last
night
which
i
decided
to
buy
it
the
wait
is
no
more
and
i
am
gald
to
have
sampled
it
and
im
happier
to
report
i
dig
it
overall
great
nose
and
taste
but
the
mouthfeel
was
very
difficult
for
me
if
you
like
thin
airy
beer
such
as
duvel
the
youll
love
this
triple
a
couple
years
may
have
helped
the
taste
mature
but
didnt
help
the
look
or
mellow
out
the
carbonation
a
tasty
treat
but
not
one
id
want
to
revisit
any
time
soon
on
the
other
hand
if
i
can
find
a
fresh
bottle
sometime
in
the
future
ill
definitely
give
er
another
go
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
offers
just
about
everything
i
want
in
a
tripel
feeling
like
a
middle
ground
between
the
zingyeastinesscitrus
of
la
fin
du
monde
and
the
softnessfloral
complexity
of
westmalle
drink
absolutely
perfect
would
enjoy
this
all

if
possible
overall
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
knockout
and
a
huge
surprise
for
those
who
expect
a
chestnut
brown
dark
fruit
bomb
from
their
belgian
tripels
a
great
surprise
and
a
terrific
find
for
me
so
glad
i
grabbed
a
bottle
at
5

exactly

seek
but
this
will
be

with

aspects
of
this

smoothness
that
actually
has
a

fit

of
what
i
look

other
then
a

this
was
very

now
i
am
left
wondering
if
its
like
this
all
the
time
reviews
of
this
seem
to
be
widely
diverse
so
i
will
definately
get
some
more
soon
and
try
again
to
make
sure
this
is
something
that
continues
to
comes
across
as
the

either
way
this

was

have
more

im
done
with
the
first
bottle
delicious
the
best
tripel
ive
had
up
to
now
two
thumbs
up
the
taste
was
slighlty
sweet
spicy
and
bitter
well
balanced
slightly
dry
on
the
tongue
and
during
the
aftertaste
the
bitterness
also
rode
the
tongue
for
a
bit
the
alcohol
level
was
not
very
noticeable
making
this
an
extremely
drinkable
belgian
tripel
i
was
so
pleased
i
had
another

the
beer
itself
is

it
poured
a

frothy

that
contained
fine

bubbles
that
was
mostly

the
body
was

carbonation

a

the
nose
was

spicy

some

michael

claims
that
the

is
heavily
spiced

annoyingly
fails
to
elaborate

i
can
taste
the
spices
which
paradoxically
dont
contribute
to
the

in
the
back
of
the
mouth
however
through
the
annoying
flavors
of
coriander
the
fluffy
body
and
the
sour
finish
i
can
find
some
really
intriguing
aspects
of
this
beer
the
oats
seem
to
be
the
biggest
difference
between
this
and
other
tripels
the
slick
creaminess
that
they
impart
is
really
unique
and
quite
appealing
they
even
helped
me
see
past
the
coriander
enough
to
score
this
beer
highly
kudos
to
bosteels
for
making
belgian
beers
that
dont
just
taste
like
all
the
other
belgian
beers
while
i
like
kwak
more
karmeleit
is
one
that
i
can
thoroughly
appreciate
even
if
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
still
my
irrational
hatred
of
coriander
should
not
dissuade
any
other
bas
from
trying
this
unique
exceptionally
well
made
beer
theres
a
very
nice
spicy
smell
full
of
sweet
fruit
the
front
specializes
that
fruit
to
apples
i
think
sweet
and
spicy
then
malt
the
finish
is
just
a
little
syrupy
but
still
manages
to
be
fresh
some
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
this
probably
isnt
the
most
interesting
tripel
but
it
sure
isnt
far
off
i
love
this
one
poors
a
nice
deep
cloudy
golden
color
head
has
bigger
bubbles
than
i
would
expect
but
settles
to
a
nice
tight
head
although
not
much
of
one
the
smell
and
taste
are
very
compatible
both
have
a
nce
mixture
of
fruit
and
spices
considering
the
abv
there
is
no
alcohol
taste
just
citrus
and
spices
with
a
yeast
undertone
this
make
for
an
excellent
dessert
beer
or
on
a
hot
midsummer
day
although
i
prefer
to
drink
this
one
all
year
round
750

a

unfortunately
this
happy
ride
was
alltoo
brief
for
the
otherwise
unredoubtable
pub
poured

8
ounces
geez
guys
id
pay
an
extra
50
for
another
2
ounces
and
willingly
too
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
an
enormous
head
so
big
i
had
to
let
it
settle
a
little
while
the
head
lasts
through
the
glass
and
ample
lacing
as
well
first
aroma
caught
me
by
surprise
fruit
but
not
sweet
grapefruit
and
sour
aromas
the
taste
was
acidic
with
alcohol
up
front
and
a
slight
dried
fruit
mouthfeel
clean
dry
finish
though
with
hints
of
spices
coming
out
didnt
see
this
one
coming
a
fine
ale
i
just
wasnt
crazy
about
it
the
pour
a
deep
golden
amber
color
with
a
magisterial
head
the
texture
creamy
and
the
lace
formed
is
a
thick
sticky
sheet
to
smother
the
glass
ripe
fruit
like
pineapple
comes
to
mind
malt
fresh
and
clean
to
the
nose
and
the
start
quite
sweet
with
a
medium
in
feel
top
vinous
and
astringent
finish
with
the
hops
sparse
but
still
noticeable
the
aftertaste
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
all
things
considered
a
decent
drinking
beer
and
well
worth
the
price
of
a
sample
golden
copper
color
big
and
bubbly
white
head
that
has
good
retention
appearance
indicates
a
high
level
of
carbonation
really
nice
doughy
yeasty
aroma
and
smoke
i
get
a
definitive
smoke
aroma
which
surprises
me
a
little
bit
some
banana
like
esters
make
their
presence
known
right
off
the
bat
a
little
bubblegum
as
well
a
very
light
phenolic
presence
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
medium
bodied
enjoyable
and
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
and
formed
a
nice
bubbly
white
head
that
left
some
circular
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
some
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
citrus
and
grain
a
flavor
of
citrus
and
grain
with
a
hint
of
clove
present
a
bit
of
tanginess
to
the
body
no
doubt
brought
on
by
the
carbonation
a
good
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
gold
with
just
a
hint
of
an
amber
tint
huge
amounts
of
carbonation
apparent
in
the
body
that
feeds
the
thick
creamy
head
long
lasting
head
that
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lace
clinging
to
the
glass
aroma
of
tart
citrus
blends
with
a
spicy
but
not
quite
peppery
smell
very
grainy
taste
with
plenty
of
fruit
and
spice
flavors
adding
complexity
the
blend
of
grains
is
very
apparent
the
oats
and
wheat
seem
to
stand
out
above
the
barley
finish
is
rather
grassy
and
a
bit
bitter
with
accompanying
hints
of
berrylike
fruit
aftertaste
has
a
nice
lingering
dose
of
alcohol
along
with
a
dry
tart
fruitiness
carbonation
gives
this
beer
a
fairly
rough
feel
very
drinkable
brew
ill
have
to
experiment
with
food
pairings
the
tremendous
forceful
pop
upon
releasing
the
cork
starts
off
another
belgian
tripel
experience
after
a
gentle
pour
a
dense
very
thick
soft
peak
beaten

comprised
of
lemon
and
unripe
orange

the
nose
at
first
then
are
ensued
by
rounder
and
sweeter
tropical
notes
akin
to
ripe
pineapple
when
combined
with
the
sweet
fruit
notes
the
mild

apple
acetaldehyde
and
alcohol
take
on
a
ripe
jackfruit
like
character
subdued
clove
adds
an
herbal
accompanient
to
the
overall

aroma
honey
like
sweetness
hits
the
palate
initially
then
is
ensued
by
a
light
wheat
tartness
and
soft
white
bread
graininess
sweetness
then
mirrors
the
aroma
mid
palate
and
becomes
fruity
and
kiwi
like
in
nature
persistent
mellow
clove
maintains
an
herbal
undertone
to
this
brew
hop
bitterness
is
indirectly
perceived
by
its
well
calculated
contrast
to
malt
sweetness
moderately
bodied
and
fairly
well
attenuated
but
with
a
full
dextrinous
mouthfeel
derived
from
the
oats
in
the
grist
finishes
dry
with
trace
phenol
and
residual
sweetness
briefly
lingering
karmeliet
is
an
assertively
fruity
tripel
and
is
certainly
unique
and
absolutely
delicious
robust
yet
refined
and
soft
on
the
palate
drink
up
triple
karmeliet
on
tap
fantastic
the
triple
refers
to
three
grains
barley
oats
and
wheat
highly
carbonated
very
nice
head
aroma
vaguely
smells
of
oranges
and
coriander
the
taste
is
sweetyeast
taste
and
pressed
oranges
with
a
perfectly
balanced
belgian
taste
this
is
a
very
very
good
beer
on
tap
it
is
one
of
the
five
best
beers
ive
ever
had
11
2
oz
bottle
just
another
very
good
belgian
trippel
yawn
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
this
ones
got
all
the
typical
attributes
of
a
fine
trippel
champagnelike
level
of
carbonation
full
of
crisp
fruity
yeasty
goodness
cant
go
wrong
here
imho
notes
quite
the
alcoholic
brew
big
boisterous
and
complex
perhaps
over
the
top
but
still
a
brew
to
reckon
with
a
good
cheese
pairing
would
be
with
a
nice
creamy
danish
blue
and
some
rye
crackers
bottle
was
monstrously
charged
a
full
12
oz
volume
of
foam
during
a
careful
pour
hazy
yellow
yeasty
fruity
aroma
chunky
lemony
citric
notes
stand
out
over
the
oats
and
barley
also
used
flavor
profile
is
upfront
with
a
consistent
fade
if
you
pour
to
the
back
of
the
mouth
its
seems
estery
and
fuller
too
astringent
overcarbonated
and
champagnelike
for
me
it
crosses
that
belgian
tripel
line
that
my
tastes
buds
dont
want
to
could
be
higher
alcohol
refresher
for
some
respectably
brewed
a
very
good
tripel
had
a
unique
taste
with
a
good
bitterness
on
the
finish
not
to
sweet
also
which
i
count
as
a
good
thing
very
sweet
with
loads
of
carbonation
fruity
but
with
a
kick
yeast
is
clearly
presentbut
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
slightly
overpowers
it
in
adding
to
this
review
i
tried
it
agian
9802
and
found
it
sort
of
dry
with
some
very
noticeable
grain
flavors
of
which
i
cannot
readily
identify
this
was
a
smoother
brew
then
before
but
remains
sweet
you
can
really
taste
and
smell
some
sort
of
crystal
like
sugar
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
on
tap
at
ashleys
ann
arbor
hazy
golden
with
white
foam
that
leaves
rings
aroma
is
banana
bubblegum
yeast
pepper
and
clove
taste
is
slightly
sweet
strongly
yeasty
gently
bitter
medium
body
active
carbonation
dry
finish
better
with
food
average
drinkable
alone
o
nice
example
of
a
tripel
flavors
are
varied
and
balanced
bold
too
but
not
overpowering
or
harsh
nice
combination
of
sweetness
spices
and
bitterness
really
just
well
put
together
which
makes
drinkability
stand
out
as
well
nicely
done
dragonmead
this
one
is
my
desert
island
beer
great
trippel
ale
first
i
had
ever
tried
and
still
one
of
my
favorites
ive
had
from
tap
and
bottle
and
both
are
great
recommend
if
you
like
trippel
ales
o
is
this
a
mead
by
definition
i
dunno
but
it
this
is
the
most
unique
beer
ive
yet
to
review
very
sweet
this
will
make
a
great
desert
beer
o
very
good
american
version
pours
a
apricot
in
color
with
a
good
2
finger
white
foamy
head
that
settles
down
to
a
good
4mm
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
is
of
bananas
cloves
and
citrus
for
the
most
part
even
more
going
on
with
the
taste
lots
of
sweetness
is
right
up
front
with
the
above
flavors
with
some
honey
black
licorice
with
a
hint
of
coriander
even
not
to
sweet
and
this
is
a
sipper
with
the
high
alcohol
content
that
warms
your
tummy
perfect
carbonation
and
full
bodied
with
lots
of
good
flavor
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
take
your
time
and
enjoy
o
interesting
american
style
trippel
its
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
i
love
the
complexity
of
aroma
and
flavor
o
very
surprised
by
this
one
i
like
it
more
than
some
belgian
trippels
ive
had
from
belgium
though
this
one
is
from
michigan
its
appearance
smell
taste
mouth
feel
and
overall
impression
put
this
one
near
the
top
of
my
list
great
stuff
coming
from
michigan
found
it
in
saginaw
at
oppermans
corknale
over
the
years
i
have
had
various
dragonmead
brews
and
have
yet
to
be
impressed
this
is
no
exception
overall
overall
a
very
tasty
and
quite
nice
drinking
tripe
that
while
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
was
very
balanced
and
smooth
quite
delicious
and
well
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
im
no
expert
on
trippels
but
this
has
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
and
is
well
balanced
if
a
tad
sweet
the
alcohol
waits
until
you
arent
looking
and
sneaks
up
on
you
this
is
an
absolutely
great
example
of
trippel
initial
color
is
semiopaque
dense
yellowish
typical
for
a
tripple
i
cant
fully
comment
on
how
it
pours
as
it
was
ontop
head
was
good
and
very
aromatic
taste
is
exceptionally
sweet
with
citrus
notes
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
lingers
notably
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
trippels
very
very
malty
with
a
nose
only
a
mother
could
love
if
youre
into
malty
sweet
brews
this
one
is
for
you
very
smooth
on
the
way
down
almost
gulpable
i
found
myself
fairly
full
afterwards
but
wanting
more
of
that
caramel
malty
flavor
a
delicious
brew
and
fun
to
drink
i
had
it
at
hopcat
lansing
mi
served
in
a
belgian
beer
glass
overall
i
find
tripels
to
be
a
boring
style
and
this
doesnt
change
that
perception
still
a
solid
beer
without
any
offensive
characteristics
that
i
didnt
mind
drinking
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
very
slight
and
short
lasting
off
white
head
the
smell
is
malty
sweet
with
a
bite
of
alcohol
and
a
little
yeast
the
flavor
follows
suit
quite
sweet
but
tangy
at
the
same
time
definite
alcohol
and
yeast
notes
but
well
balanced
by
the
sweet
malts
this
is
a
well
crafted
belgium
style
ale
but
i
ask
why
buy
an
american
alternative
to
the
classic
style
when
there
are
so
many
perfect
examples
coming
straight
from
the
original
source
just
my
opinion
an
excellent
tripel
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
but
with
enough
dryness
to
balance
it
out
delicious
12

that
is

alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
tripel
all
around
great
complexity
and
balance
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
big
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
the
body
is
smooth
with
a
soft
but
firm
crispness
its
creamy
with
a
light
to
medium
body
overall
drinkability
very
tasty
and
if
it
didnt
say
tripel
i
would
have
just
chalked
this
up
to
a
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
would
not
mind
at
all
having
another
but
as
a
proper
tripel
should
the
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
and
let
you
know
its
there
by
the
end
of
the
second
glass
good
overall
beer
but
the
appearance
was
a
disappointment
it
should
have
had
better
lacing
and
head
oa
nice
tasting
tripel
enjoyed
savoring
this
one
overall
probably
my
favorite
american
take
on
a
trappist
style
trippel
while
not
equal
to
any
belgian
equivalent
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
well
balanced
refreshing
with
a
nice
sourfruity
presence
that
adds
some
zest
to
the
normal
bready
trippel
style
my
favorite
offering
from
dragonsmead
a
quality
brew
that
i
will
buy
again
pretty
hard
to
find
even
in
se
michigan
overall
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
this
style
ill
definitely
have
it
again
to
the
point
a
pretty
good
trippel
a
solid
representation
of
this
style
it
is
worthy
to
purchase
united
states
overall
excellent
beer
a
good
tripel
that
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
semicommon
beer
at
the
more
multitaplike
places
in
my
area
and
a
beer
that
i
find
myself
revisiting
a
lot
definitely
worth
a
shot
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
m
medium
body
light
to
moderate
carbonation
rather
one
dimensional
reminiscent
of
new
belgiums
trip
clove
and
spicy
sweet
fruit
good
not
great
o
good
tripel
the
alcohol
was
masked
well
dragonmead
website
has
this
listed
at
10
ba
has
it
at
8
5
i
say
its
around
9
5
i
will
be
stocking
4packs
of
this
throughout
the
summer
good
representation
of
the
style
final
absolution
is
a
good
american
triple
however
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
dragonmead
it
has
a
way
to
go
to
compete
with
the
top
shelf
triples
a
nice
tripel
but
not
one
i
would
seek
again
thanks
adam
for
sharing
o
cant
believe
this
is
from
warren
this
is
an
excellent
fall
beer
and
a
great
trippel
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
a
very
fruity
beer
but
still
a
great
one
that
id
gladly
have
again
though
its
looks
are
very
unremarkable
what
matters
the
most
is
the
taste
and
this
tastes
very
good
in
my
opinion
just
beware
of
the
abv
i
didnt
realize
it
was
so
high
oops
on
tap
in
a
pint
glass
at
ashleys
in
ann
arbor
pours
clear
golden
with
small
head
for
a
trippel
aroma
of
yeast
spice
pears
honey
tastes
follows
with
a
sweet
honey
pear
flavor
with
a
little
belgian
spice
one
the
sweet
and
heavy
side
for
the
style
but
thats
not
surprising
given
the
10
abv
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
and
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
in
the
style
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
for
the
abv
almost
too
smooth
taste
is
good
and
although
not
necessarily
something
ill
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
id
gladly
drink
one
again
had
both
in
many
bottles
and
on
tap
many
times
and
the
town
pump
bar
in
detroit
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
goldenamber
color
heavy
cloudiness
in
the
middle
fairly
volatile
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
surprisingly
quick
the
aroma
is
great
baskets
of
sweet
earthy
esters
spicy
belgian
yeast
and
bread
clove
white
pepper
phenol
alcohol
bananas
apple
skins
pears
and
a
nice
whiff
of
bubble
gum
the
taste
is
no
slouch
either
final
absolution
hits
the
palate
soft
and
slightly
silky
mediumbodied
and
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
belgian
yeast
flavors
bready
spicy
clove
pepper
banana
esters
earth
and
bubble
gum
dominate
the
palate
some
floral
and
perfumelike
hop
notes
hit
up
front
with
a
very
short
and
sweet
bitterness
that
quickly
gives
way
to
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
the
aftertaste
is
heavy
on
the
bread
and
yeast
flavors
like
you
would
expect
from
any
decent
tripel
cloudy
golden
pour
huge
frothy
head
very
fine
lacing
smells
of
almond
tangerine
and
cream
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
some
additional
almond
and
wheat
flavors
excellent
brew
my
first
trippel
and
a
fine
belgian
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
it
up
again
about
as
good
a
tripel
as
i
have
ever
had
certainly
the
best
i
have
made
in
michigan
and
unless
i
am
forgetting
one
the
best
i
have
had
made
in
the
u
s
i
honestly
believe
it
competes
favorably
with
la
fin
du
monde
for
the
best
tripel
made
in
na
o
nice
take
on
the
style
and
a
very
tasty
brew
nice
local
option
when
im
in
the
mood
foe
a
tripel
oh
get
back
on
your
feet
carefully
after
a
couple
of
these
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
belgian
styles
are
usually
not
my
favorite
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
with
lots
of
unique
flavors
i
would
recommend
it
o
my
first
dragonmead
beer
the
aroma
is
great
and
flavors
are
a
complex
mix
of
tart
and
sweet
this
is
probably
the
best
tripel
i
have
had
in
my
limited
experience
with
the
style
with
the
possible
exception
of
la
fin
du
monde
highly
recommended
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
snifter
from
the
bottle
a
cloudy
gold
color
was
observed
during
the
pour
with
hints
of
banana
growing
during
the
pour
the
banana
scent
is
a
reflection
of
the
belgian
yeast
that
is
very
apparent
in
the
scent
and
taste
the
initial
taste
was
a
pleasantly
tart
banana
taste
that
danced
along
the
sour
borders
of
the
tongue
a
hint
of
spice
may
be
observed
by
some
during
the
initial
sip
in
the
aftertaste
a
hint
of
butterscotch
becomes
somewhat
apparent
but
the
banana
continues
the
trippel
is
smooth
yet
thick
enough
to
stick
to
the
tongue
and
allow
the
taste
to
linger
as
the
alcohol
warms
on
the
way
down
the
gullet
it
becomes
apparent
that
the
beer
looks
tastes
and
feels
good
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
very
smooth
with
carbonation
thats
both
zesty
and
mild
at
the
same
time
a
medium
body
and
a
funky
finish
that
has
a
bready
sweetness
to
it
which
allows
the
abv
to
peek
through
well
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
for
this
style
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
worth
trying
this
poured
quite
cloudy
despite
my
careful
decanting
as
there
was
a
good
quarter
inch
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
there
was
definitely
a
yeasty
sourness
to
both
the
aroma
and
taste
the
sourness
ends
up
accenting
the
strong
but
well
balanced
malt
and
hops
on
the
whole
this
tastes
more
like
a
strong
farmhouse
ale
than
a
tripel
and
although
its
not
my
favorite
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
i
have
tried
d
all
ingredients
are
in
a
fine
balance
and
this
beer
really
surprised
me
for
its
many
fine
qualities
like
aroma
flavor
and
superb
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
where
it
should
be
for
this
style
and
not
overwhelming
if
you
see
this
one
out
there
do
try
it
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
from
a
brewery
im
totally
unfamiliar
with
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
topnotch
but
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
and
was
in
the
mood
for
a
tripel
i
would
have
it
again
im
curious
to
try
more
brews
from
dragonmead
o
i
enjoyed
to
olfactory
and
taste
aspects
of
this
beer
it
was
a
nice
spicy
smack
in
the
mouth
before
going
to
a
family
dinner
that
concludes
my
reviews
of
dragonmead
beers
i
collected
during
my
recent
michigan
trip
i
would
put
dragonmead
on
the
2nd
tier
of
michigan
breweries
consistancy
seems
to
be
their
issue
and
that
is
probably
the
case
with
this
beer
o
really
nice
trippel
i
love
this
style
and
this
is
a
great
addition
to
the
already
great
repertoire
o
a
good
tripel
overall
the
yeast
characters
are
a
bit
too
strong
and
its
slightly
too
thick
for
my
tastes
but
still
good
pours
a
yellowishorange
w
a
nice
two
finger
head
good
carbonation
and
lacing
on
the
light
side
for
the
style
but
still
a
nice
looking
tripel
nose
is
fruit
banana
spice
yeast
malt
very
pleasant
although
not
quite
up
to
the
best
belgian
tripels
taste
is
the
same
profile
its
a
nice
beer
just
not
a
great
beer
id
like
a
little
more
complexity
w
this
one
feel
is
good
although
id
like
it
to
be
a
little
smoother
too
much
carbonation
overall
i
liked
this
one
its
just
not
world
class
still
id
have
it
again
overall
not
a
terrible
version
of
a
triple
but
nowhere
near
my
favorites
of
the
style
final
absolution
is
my
first
beer
from
dragonmead
microbrewery
for
an
american
tripel
it
really
is
pretty
impressive
its
not
quite
on
par
with
the
elite
tripels
out
there
but
its
definitely
good
its
biggest
problems
are
that
its
overly
sweet
and
a
little
too
boozy
in
flavor
other
than
that
it
really
does
perform
pretty
well
if
youre
in
a
pinch
for
a
pretty
solid
tripel
final
absolution
is
worthy
of
your
attention
cheers
drinkability
and
overall
impression
ive
enjoyed
sipping
this
one
each
sip
leaves
me
so
ready
for
another
and
ill
be
happy
to
have
this
beer
again
in
the
future
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
which
is
deserving
of
its
awards
and
is
an
outstanding
beer
that
is
a
nice
expression
of
a
belgian
style
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
little
alcohol
presence
solid
tripel
and
one
i
would
gladly
have
again
seems
to
have
a
bit
heavier
body
or
perhaps
the
carbonation
is
not
as
strong
compared
to
others
in
the
style
the
fruity
notes
go
very
well
with
the
character
the
yeast
is
contributing
very
enjoyable
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
golden
color
with
hints
of
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissipated
too
quickly
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
spicy
as
a
good
belgian
should
be
the
taste
follows
the
nose
well
but
with
a
distinct
banana
and
spice
notes
there
was
also
a
slight
pepper
flavor
that
appeared
during
the
beer
the
beer
was
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
beer
had
a
moderate
mouth
feel
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
fine
brew
and
one
that
i
hope
to
enjoy
again
dragonmead
yes
ive
had
a
small
handful
of
their
beers
i
only
get
to
try
them
once
a
year
in
july
next
year
i
need
to
hit
their
pub
dragonmead
is
an
extremely
solid
unappreciated
brewery
in
mi
a
state
full
of
extremely
solid
unappreciated
breweries
the
dragonmead
footprint
seems
small
and
that
is
a
shame
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
candidate
for
michigans
top
beer
go
get
this
is
very
smooth
drinking
the
carbonation
is
just
about
perfect
for
the
style
medium
to
light
bodied
and
just
damn
tasty
belgian
ales
are
usually
sweet
and
spicy
the
flavors
are
what
make
this
style
and
final
absolution
doesnt
fall
short
within
this
category
if
you
happen
to
come
across
one
of
these
pick
it
up
dragonmead
has
done
an
awesome
job
replicating
the
flavor
profile
of
a
classic
trippel
taste
banana
spice
subtle
bitterness
finish
is
dry
with
a
little
bit
of
honey
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
one
of
the
better
american
tripels
ive
had
but
not
to
the
level
of
some
of
the
belgians
still
theres
no
shame
in
that
i
passed
a
bottle
of
this
around
at
dld
and
people
had
the
same
impression
a
nice
under
the
radar
brew
that
probably
deserves
a
little
more
love
than
it
gets
overall
i
used
to
be
big
on
tripels
but
perhaps
my
tastes
are
changing
either
that
or
it
tastes
superdifferent
on
tap
either
way
i
think
its
just
slightly
above
average
for
a
tripel
not
bad
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
good
to
be
sure
but
definitely
not
great
the
smell
is
pretty
neutral
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
and
some
pineapplebanana
comes
around
this
beer
has
a
full
taste
and
it
is
very
worth
trying
drinkability
i
think
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
i
dont
know
that
ill
search
it
out
again
this
is
an
amazing
beer
in
fact
i
have
brewed
a
clone
of
this
i
like
it
that
much
it
is
suprisingly
smooth
for
the
alcohol
content
and
isnt
too
sweet
it
is
not
heavy
or
overpowering
i
have
turned
many
people
on
to
this
beer
its
great
that
you
can
also
get
it
bottled
part
of
a
beer
score
of
michigan
brews
graciously
bequithed
upon
me
by
relatives
visiting
at
christmastime
lets
give
it
a
whirl
at
first
glance
i
see
it
is
bottle
conditioned
as
it
has
yeast
on
the
bottom
give
a
swirl
and
let
it
rest
a
bit
as
to
avoid
playing
beer
hunter
popping
the
top
of
this
brew
it
smells
well
yeasty
also
very
malty
with
hints
of
licorice
spices
and
candies
pours
to
a
cloudy
yellow
orange
with
a
fizzy
off
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
im
letting
it
warm
a
bit
as
this
is
one
i
dont
want
to
drink
too
cold
on
the
first
sip
the
first
standout
is
mouthfeel
mouthfeel
is
like
syrup
with
a
fizziness
that
adds
to
flavor
the
flavor
is
sweet
at
the
start
almost
citrus
like
but
then
quickly
shifts
to
a
sour
tartiness
that
then
transitions
into
a
slightly
bitter
finish
there
is
some
warming
but
for
the
most
part
the
high
ac
isnt
readily
evident
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
that
will
without
a
doubt
knock
your
socks
off
overall
an
very
good
brew
that
deserves
to
be
tried
if
you
get
the
opportunity
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
tripel
it
wasnt
mind
blowing
by
any
means
but
it
was
a
nicely
balanced
tripel
i
would
not
turn
down
a
chance
to
have
this
brew
again
i
hope
to
try
to
some
more
dragonmead
beers
in
the
future

pours
a

lime
yellow
with
a
ring
of
white
head
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
and
spices
especially
clove
flavor
is
again
mostly
belgian
yeast
with
lots
of
spices
and
some
bready
malt
an
ok
belgian
but
not
very
trippelesque
actually
without
the
usual
fruity
undertones
final
absulution
has
an
opaque
butterscotch
color
with
bits
of
sentiment
floating
around
in
it
a
thin
yet
frothy
head
quickly
fizzed
away
the
smells
are
sweet
fruity
and
almost
waxy
like
it
has
a
light
and
creamy
fruity
and
nutty
taste
to
it
the
beer
does
well
in
masking
the
alcohol
with
flavor
a
top
choice
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumlight
with
enough
carbonation
this
is
the
tastiest
tripel
ive
had
id
love
to
stock
my
fridge
with
this
stuff
better
still
the
brewery
is
5
miles
away
notes
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
worth
trying
but
i
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
this
may
be
a
bad
bottle
ill
have
to
try
this
again
to
be
sure
my
ratings
appear
to
be
out
of
sync
with
the
mainstream
on
this
one
in
conclusion
in
my
experience
if
you
want
a
good
trippel
look
to
the
belgians
or
at
least
unibroue
this
is
a
good
effort
however
and
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
no
off
flavors
or
any
major
complaints
pretty
damn
spoton
especially
for
an
american
brewer
many
tend
to
allow
their
tripels
to
finish
way
too
sweet
and
often
fruity
and
not
so
belgian
well
gladly
light
our
hands
on
fire
for
another
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
collared
white
head
fairly
effervscent
belgian
yeast
characteristics
in
the
nose
through
and
through
sweet
smelling
with
banana
and
clove
pretty
smooth
tasting
as
well
sweet
up
front
with
flavors
of
banana
clove
and
some
spice
finishes
with
a
lingering
belgian
yeast
taste
overall
not
bad
at
all
in
my
opinion
overall
a
pretty
average
tripel
maybe
a
bit
above
average
decent
drinkability
nothing
really
out
of
the
ordinary
here
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
on
my
trip
into
the
midwest
conclusion
really
glad
to
finally
get
to
try
a
dragonmead
beer
this
one
is
not
a
bad
tripel
but
new
belgiums
has
a
bit
more
characterdepth
than
this
for
less
money
and
its
available
here
drinkability
the
high
alcohol
content
brings
this
down
the
slightest
notch
for
me
other
than
that
this
beer
is
excellent
d
the
clove
is
a
bit
dominate
for
me
but
the
light
crisp
and
very
refreshing
aspects
of
the
beer
kick
up
the
drinkability
d
very
refreshing
and
tasty
easily
drinkable
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
on
tap
for
several
years
never
had
it
in
a
bottle
but
have
never
been
disappointed
and
recommend
it
regularly
to
others
this
final
absolution
we
can
classify
under
the
category
of
aftermeal
dessert
beer
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
time
until
they
start
serving
them
in
20oz
glasses
in
which
i
am
about
to
blow
through
a
founders
breakfast
stout
and
lower
the
prices
it
was
a
good
experience
but
ill
probably
only
experience
this
dragonmead
concoction
at
a
tasting
in
the
future
not
the
most
well
balanced
belgian
trippel
ive
had
but
a
solid
example
nontheless
im
a
big
fan
of
dragonmead
just
not
my
fav
of
their
brews
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
you
can
not
taste
a
whiff
of
the
8
5
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
light
amber
color
and
formed
a
off
white
bubbly
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
hops
banana
spices
and
belgian
yeasts
the
flavor
was
of
malt
bread
and
a
bit
of
butter
the
body
was
medium
and
the
finish
was
slightly
sprite
this
is
not
a
bad
trip
just
a
shame
i
have
to
go
to
michigan
to
get
it

good

0

50abv
this
is

i
cant
detect
the

at
all
its
very
tasty

smooth
this
presumes
that
you
dont
mind
sweeter
not
so
hoppy
beers
though
drinkability
quite
a

take
from
many
belgian
versions
of
the
style
this
is
still
a
very
nice
beer
with
its
own
character
unlike
some
american
tripels
that
are
too
onedimensional
with
tons
of
alcohol
this
one
has
some
subtlety
and
complexity
this
one
has
aged
about
a
year
and
clearly
benefited
from
that
time
in
the
bottle
d
i
liked
this
tripel
alot
mostly
due
to
its
complexity
of
flavor
without
that
this
beer
would
be
a
bit
too
sweet
but
the
spicy
character
really
makes
this
ale
shine
i
would
buy
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
d
an
interesting
and
slightly
bizarre
triple
that
definitely
has
some
funk
with
that
strange
apple
presence
could
be
young
could
be
too
old
i
have
no
idea
tastes
fine
but
not
what
i
would
normally
expect
from
what
a
triple
normally
is
12oz
pour
reveals
a
tangerine
ale
topped
with
a
thin
white
head
aromas
are
fruity
belgian
yeast
hints
of
apricot
pear
apple
with
some
faint
alcohol
tastes
are
fruity
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
alcohol
prickles
on
the
tongue
along
with
some
peppery
notes
and
a
slight
mandarin
orange
along
with
notes
of
ethanol
overall
not
a
bad
belgian
trippel
i
guess
you
could
say
that
theres
nothing
too
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
great
about
it
either
i
have
never
had
it
in
a
bottle
so
i
cannot
speak
to
that
however
on
tap
or
from
a
freshly
filled
growler
this
beer
is
on
of
my
favorites
i
truly
enjoyed
this
brew
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
this
isnt
bad
but
there
are
many
much
better
tripels
out
there
its
a
solid
american
take
on
the
tripel
but
just
not
a
style
id
seek
out
drinkability
not
bad
like
i
said
im
not
the
hugest
fan
of
the
style
but
i
do
appreciate
trippels
for
what
they
are
this
one
is
definitely
on
the
better
side
as
american
interpretations
go
definitely
worth
a
try
if
given
the
opportunity
on
tap
at
the
wonderful
hopcat
in
grand
rapids
during
my
business
trip
to
the
area
in
march
served
in
a
hopcatlabeled
tulip
glass
very
citrusy
aroma
on
the
house
due
to
my
purchase
of
a
750ml
of
shorts
imperial
black
cherry
porter
some
sticky
lacing
after
each
pull
typical
wheat
color
for
the
style
a
nice
brew
drinkable
a
very
well
done
beer
for
a
style
that
has
no
defining
characteristics
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
good
carbonation
d
i
would
not
turn
one
down
but
i
wouldnt
drink
too
many
sweetness
factor
is
a
bit
much
had
this
on
tap
small
head
when
brought
to
the
table
big
lacing
a
little
cloudy
and
orangish
in
color
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
as
is
the
flavor
a
little
malty
as
well
i
thought
the
bitterness
was
light
to
medium
the
spice
good
and
the
sweetness
a
little
strong
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
medium
bodied
slightly
peppery
it
does
have
a
nice
dry
well
carbonated
feel
and
the
aftertaste
was
pleasant
and
didnt
linger
nothing
overwhelming
or
unique
about
this
one
but
i
am
enjoying
it
as
solid
an
example
of
a
trippel
as
ive
had
smooth
and
crisp
finish
and
highly
drinkable
at
8
5

one

big
soapy
bubbles
sit
in
random
spots
over
the
body
smell
is
overly
malty
not
really
appealing
in
my
opinion
taste
is
nice
and
sweet
up
front
bitter
on
the
back
some
banana
and
bubble
gum
too
whoa
am
i
drinking
a
hefe
i
remember
this
tasting
okay
on
draught
at
the
brewpub
this
isnt
working
it
for
me
alcohol
starts
to
come
through
mid
way
down
and
even
though
this
is
almost
balanced
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
again
this
isnt
the
best
tripel
that
ive
ever
had
but
at
10
99
for
a
four
pack
its
definitely
the
most
affordable
if
you
like
tripels
you
should
try
to
pick
this
one
up
this
beer
pours
beautiful
even
if
the
taste
didnt
match
up
it
still
might
be
worth
it
it
ahs
a
radiant
orange
hue
mixed
with
a
bit
of
straw
the
smell
is
floral
up
front
with
citrus
back
it
tastes
just
a
bit
below
how
it
looks
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
makes
this
beer
a
near
perfect
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
champagne
like
overall
i
say
try
it
enjoy
it
the
aroma
has
an
agreeable
yeasty
quality
that
gives
off
sents
of
banana
spice
and
clove
actually
a
little
spicy
peppermaybe
ginger
too
soft
notes
of
citrus
quite
pleasant
once
it
warmsat
first
i
thought
it
may
just
taste
like
heff
by
the
aroma
witch
im
not
really
a
fan
of
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
only
mildly
drying
on
the
finish
slightly
grainy
at
times
a
pleasing
aftertaste
that
lingers
the
taste
is
of
dried
citrus
peel
and
banana
clove
coriander
pepper
and
other
like
spices
a
little
grainand
sweet
malts
this
brew
is
way
better
at
almost
room
temp
d
still
a
sipper
but
higher
drinkability
than
average
not
overly
loaded
with
flavour
for
trippel
but
nice
balance
and
very
smooth
pretty
average
in
flavor
and
aroma
for
an
american
interpretation
but
quite
subpar
with
the
carbonation
level
and
poor
appearance
d
well
balanced
and
complex
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
some
critters
got
in
this
bottle
and
affected
it
a
bit
i
certainly
enjoyed
the
funky
aroma
but
it
slightly
changed
the
flavor
from
its
intended
result
not
bad
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
perhaps
had
on
tap
in
okemos
looks
good
cloudy
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
small
but
thick
white
head
lots

is
sharp
citrus
peel
white

wet

taste
is
sour
sugary
grapefruit
with
more
pepper
some
spicy

notes
a
tripel

heavy

alcohol
is

good
mouthfeel
great
beer
overall
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellowlight
amber
color
with
1
finger
of
foamy
white
head
average
retention
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
smells
of
barnyard
funk
bananas
clove
peppery
spices
and
fruits
like
apples
and
pears
tastes
of
apples
and
spices
up
front
followed
by
banana
clove
honey
and
yeasty
bread
malt
finishes
with
some
peppery
spices
and
alcohol
kick
medium
in
body
with
low
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
but
also
having
a
crisp
finish
and
a
nice
bite
a
very
easy
drinking
tripel
with
great
fruity
flavors
but
not
tasting
too
much
of
alcohol
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
several
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
creamy
with
a
bit
of
sharpness
to
it
as
well
the
graininess
comes
through
quite
a
bit
on
the
finish
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
pronounced
in
my
opinion
making
it
a
little
harder
to
fully
enjoy
the
brew
overall
this
one
failed
to
really
wow
me
id
probably
choose
another
dragonmead
offering
before
this
next
time
d
the
first
i
have
had
of
tripel
belgians
but
this
is
really
good
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
just
from
sampling
this
beer
is
going
to
cause
me
to
travel
to
the
brewery
highly
recommended
although
drinking
the
4
from
the
box
might
be
a
challenge
due
to
the
10
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
tripels
ive
had
with
some
lively
flavors
and
an
unbelievable
drinkibility
for
a
9
beer
this
was
the
gem
of
our
visit
when
we
checked
out
this
surprising
gem
of
a
brewpub
d
this
will
get
you
it
goes
down
really
smooth
it
has
a
nice
sweet
finish
and
no
bitterness
overall
a
wonderful
american
trippel
nice
sweet
fruity
yeasty
flavors
that
leave
me
yearning
for
more
very
good
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
this
one
d
this
was
an
excellent
beer
i
havent
had
a
tripel
in
a
while
and
this
one
definitely
hit
the
spot
great
one
to
sip
on
serving
type
bottle
d
an
excellent
style
representation
the
noticeable
alcohol
keeps
the
drinkability
down
somewhat
but
this
is
a
very
very
nice
beer
paired
beautifully
with
a
penne
carbonara
dish
i
had
prepared
recommended
overall
fairly
good
but
not
topclass
id
like
to
see
a
creamier
mouthfeel
and
a
slightly
dryer
finish
drink
this
stuff
d
great
example
of
the
tripel
style
i
would
swear
this
was
made
in
belgium
if
i
didnt
know
better
tasters
note
special
thanks
to
arrogantbastard1
for
procuring
a
bottle
md
slightly
fizzy
so
its
lively
on
the
tongue
but
smooth
and
inviting
as
you
finish
the
taste
wellcrafted
their
flagship
beer
and
not
a
bad
foot
to
put
forward
imho
this
dragonmead
offering
sounds
like
the
title
of
the
ultimate
workout
dvd
drinking
too
many
sixpacks
beer
belly
getting
you
down
get
sixpack
abs
in
mere
minutes
a
day
by
using
final
ab
solution
okay
maybe
not
final
absolution
is
good
solid
beer
that
still
doesnt
come
within
sniffing
distance
of
allagash
tripel
reserve
for
the
title
of
best
american
tripel
d
the
yeasty
fruit
flavors
are
a
bit
overpowering
but
the
sweetness
blends
well
with
the
softer
hops
this
is
a
great
american
draft
at
the
tripel
i
still
maintain
the
american
renditions
cant
quite
compare
exactly
to
the
belgian
originals
this
is
quite
a
lovely
ale
though
true
to
style
and
wonderfully
brewed
i
would
place
as
one
of
the
top
us
tripels
thanks
dad
for
picking
this
one
up
merchants
in
dearborn
purchased
about
ten
days
ago
poured
a
murky
cloudy
golden
with
orange
tangerine
flashes
generous
small
bubble
carbonation
it
sure
smells
like
a
belgian
trippel
yeast
is
very
up
front
with
citrus
and
orange
peel
the
taste
is
a
fruity
marmalade
orange
and
lemon
rind
presence
with
hints
of
all
spice
paprika
more
fruit
rind
in
the
finish
went
flat
after
a
short
time
but
the
taste
got
more
intense
as
it
warmed
with
more
fruit
bitter
slightly
acidic
taste
and
mouthfeel
but
the
alcohol
also
got
more
pronounced
too
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
trippel
and
ill
have
to
get
more
of
this
next
time
im
in
the
area
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
if
someone
offers
a
freebie
ill
taste
a
bit
to
ensure
this
wasnt
just
a
fluke
bad
bottle
not
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
tripel
but
who
cares
when
the
beer
tastes
as
good
as
this
d
a
good
triple
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again
pours
a
dark
hazy
gold
color
with
just
a
bit
of
slightly
offwhite
head
smell
is
slightly
fruity
grape
plum
maybe
with
some
spicy
notes
and
an
overall
sweet
scent
taste
follows
very
closely
with
the
plum
flavor
coming
out
more
a
bit
of
clovelike
spice
and
a
definite
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
almost
like
cough
syrup
drinkability
is
ok
though
between
the
heaviness
and
the
high
abv
its
far
from
something
youd
want
to
do
all
night
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
drinkability
very
nice
i
could
get
used
to
this
should
have
brought
a
growler
home
with
me
highly
recommended
pours
orange
mostly
clear
in
my
goblet
streams
of
little
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
and
forming
a
little
covering
of
a
head
odor
is
spicey
and
old
bananas
flavor
is
assertive
citrus
and
banana
flavors
with
some
coriander
and
cloves
thrown
in
well
balanced
and
well
made
representation
of
the
style
seems
like
dm
is
really
making
craftbrews
d
an
average
tripel
that
i
probably
will
not
try
again
d
the
sweetness
of
this
kind
of
got
to
me
i
dont
really
feel
it
was
worth
the
money
i
paid
for
it
but
hey
what
can
you
do
d
the
alcohol
other
than
a
slight
hint
in
the
nose
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
very
balanced
and
makes
for
a
fine
tripel
to
sip
on
im
at
a
point
where
this
is
nearly
the
only
tripel
ill
go
out
of
my
way
for
its
amazing
and
anyone
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
get
it
on
tap
is
just
that
lucky
ill
keep
drinking
this
as
long
as
dragonmead
is
brewing
flavor
is
quite
nice
more
malty
sweet
than
candy
sweet
except
for
a
lemon
candy
thing
goin
on
also
am
i
picking
up
what
both
in
the
flavor
and

lots
of
citrus
especially
as
the
beer
warmsboth
citrus
and
orange
medium

not
a

american
tripel
at
all
nice
job
this
is
my
second
review
of
this
beer
i
do
think
it
has
a
better
taste
on
tap
but
its
not
bad
in
the
bottle
just
remember
to
let
it
warm
up
a
little
and
that
dry
carbonation
funk
flavor
goes
away
tried
to
go
over
a
few
times
to
make
sure
of
my
solid
4
rating
for
each
category
but
did
not
change
ends
up
a
good
beer
must
say
that
my
memory
of
drinking
it
off
the
tap
at
their
brew
pub
seemed
much
better
i
poured
this
twelve
ounce
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
with
and
agressinve
pour
i
got
a
nice
head
topping
a
couldy
amber
body
nice
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
citrus
slight
hop
at
the
end
very
smooth
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
acidic
slight
pepper
and
spice
soft
on
the
pallate
proper
carbonation
enjoyable
would
buy
again
a
decent
brew
with
some
real
shining
points
not
a
tripel
i
would
revisit
taste
wow
the
bananas
stand
out
even
more
in
the
flavor
the
cloves
and
bubblegum
flavors
are
there
as
well
but
not
quite
as
strongly
as
the
bananas
im
getting
a
little
bit
of
a
pepper
and
candied
sugar
with
a
little
orange
peel
thrown
in
the
mix
did
i
mention
bananas
yet
moutheel
is
thick
and
a
touch
on
the
syrupy
side
drinkablility
is
also
really
good
with
only
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
present
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
notes
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
it
was
very
drinkable
and
seemed
close
to
what
i
interpret
to
be
the
style
the
body
is
fairly
full
good
balance
between
an
initial
sweetness
fading
into
a
nice
dry
finish
not
a
bad
tripel
but
certainly
not
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
a
most
interesting
place
the
highest
recommended
to
me
lots
of
lace
cloudy
orange
and
white
ring
head
decent
body
suitable
though
aggressive
carbonation
some
fruitiness
yeasty
aroma
on
sweet
side
sugar
and
also
spiciness
d
interesting
take
on
the
tripel
style
much
darker
and
maltier
than
any
other
tripel
ive
had
however
it
still
manages
to
retain
the
overall
character
of
a
good
belgian
tripel
pours
a
hazy
deep
dull
orange
very
dark
for
a
tripel
modest
white
head
a
little
less
than
i
generally
expect
from
a
tripel
banana
pudding
aromas
leap
from
the
glass
backed
with
spice
starts
off
on
the
palate
with
a
truckload
of

dry

body
is
very
heavy
for

the

a
little
lighter
than
normal
unfortunately
i
like
my
tripels
feather
light
and
cottony
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
definitely
a
different
take
on
a
tripel
not
bad
at
all
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
amber
phenolic
fruity
and
spicy
aroma
with
hints
of
sugars
banana
clove
cinnamon
and
ginger
again
very
phenolic
and
a
rather
typical
creation
that
shows
a
lot
of
fruity
esters
banana
clove
and
fruits
yeasty
as
hell
and
the
hops
are
quite
spicy
in
their
lingering
bite
sugary
good
stuff
think
with
not
very
much
carbonation
has
some
fruity
esters
in
there
has
a
spicy
kick
to
it
as
well
the
8

alcohol
warms
up
the
mouth
and
throat
pretty
complex
brew
with
loads
of
flavors
for
the
palate
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
and
will
be
pursuing
many
more

well
this
isnt
my
cup
of
beer
as
it
were
this
is
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
for
me
the
bubble
gumbanana
cream
was
too
much
a
pleasure
to
consume
in
moderation
a
loss
of
control
would
most
likely
not
be
in
order
a
good
remedy
for
a
rare
craving
of
this
nature
twould
not
be
a
bad
idea
to
have
it
close
at
hand
for
a
moment
of
need
tis
better
to
curse
the
darkness
than
to
light
thy

this

this
is
a

the

subdued
enough
to

the

come
through

some

the

are
noted
as

traces

were
also
noted

and
a
good
kick

finished
with
a
syrupy

taste
and
feel
kind
of
weird
still
its
a
well
made
beer
but
on
the
expensive
side
for
what
you
get
recommended
for
trippel
fans
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
slight
head
aroma
reeks
of
malt
with
some
acidic
green
apple
notes
alcohol
and
faint
bananas
taste
is
very
rich
malts
enfused
with
bitter
green
apples
although
there
is
some
subtle
bananas
the
apples
really
come
though
an
interesting
take
on
the
trippel
style
although
im
not
sure
i
really
like
it
alcohol
is
present
in
the
flavor
but
to
a
small
degree
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thin
nothing
too
interesting
overall
the
flavor
is
pretty
acidic
on
account
of
the
apples
it
diminishes
the
drinkability
not
sure
if
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
but
it
was
interesting
nonetheless
slàinte
it
poured
a
golden
body
topped
with
a
white
head
that
hung
around
and
left
little
lace
it
has
a
bready
smell
with
spices
of
pepper
alcohol
sugar
clove
and
ginger
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
triple
ladden
with
spices
in
the
nose
the
alcohol
carries
slightly
into
the
finish
and
follows
with
the
yeast
flavor
the
body
is
thickish
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
could
have
several
more
of
these

complex

i
heard
that
they
only
bottled
a
few
cases
of
this
so
i
guess
that
i
am
lucky
for
being
able
to
get
it
anyways
this
was
one
solid
tripel
but
its
flavors
were
slightly
immature
definitely
a
strong
yeast
precense
and
the
yeast
strain
was
excellent
and
made
the
beer
what
is
was
the
other
flavors
were
very
fruity
and
strong
banana
flavor
at
that
the
banana
flavor
was
almost
too
strong
i
also
noticed
some
grape
flavor
and
plums
slightly
bready
and
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
this
beer
was
well
carbonated
and
had
a
nice
slick
mouthfeel
all
in
all
a
good
beer
but
definitely
could
use
some
aging
to
mellow
that
banana
flavor
soft
mouthfeel
with
almost
no
carbonation
a
finely
crafted
version
of
the
tripel
style
and
one
i
am
glad
they
started
bottling

to

the
personal

a
small

of
fine

medium
sized

left
a
fair

and
had
a
cloudy

brown
body
it
had
a
fruity
aroma
with
an
apricot
flavor
which
was
not
greatly
to
my
liking
we
had
this
brew
at
the
festival
in
frankenmuth
michigan
when
this
beer
was
poured
into
my
glass
it
poured
with
a
small
head
that
unfortunately
dissolved
quickly
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
with
this
beer
it
had
a
very
cloudy
appearance
to
it
the
aroma
was
fruity
in
my
opinion
this
brew
was
not
to
my
liking
a
truly
wondeful
beer
sampled
several
times
over
at
the
polar

this
is

for
the

not

though
its
definitely
there
in

drinkability

the

that

everything
you
would
expect
from

all
in

very
different
than
most

i
have
tried
this
one
drinks
heavier

has
a
very
strong

yeast
component
that
being
said
besides
the
hint
of

i
was
getting
on

this
one
is
a

example
of
what
the
tripel
style
can
be
mensjournal100best2014
i
bought
a
case
of
this
and
have
been
drinking
a
couple
of
bottles
a
year
its
best
to
drink
it
within
the
first
couple
of
years
after
bottling
on
the
more
youthful
bottles
the
nose
is
light
fruit
in
various
stages
of
ripeness
mostly
peach
like
but
it
becomes
more
like
pineapple
with
traces
of
banana
and
then
sherry
as
it
ages
it
pours
straw
gold
with
a
slight
haze
under
a
1
finely
bubbled
rocky
white
foam
cap
it
has
a
fruit
palate
with
peach
and
traces
of
bubble
gum
suspended
in
an
outrageous
texture
halfway
between
liquid
and
foam
that
finishes
with
an
assertive
bitterness
the
bitterness
fades
as
it
ages
overall
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
a
tripel
and
since
this
is
one
of
the
higher
rated
ones
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
go
but
i
have
had
better
it
think
this
one
is
a
little
more
bitter
and
a
little
more
lingering
on
the
tongue
than
i
would
prefer
of
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
very
worthwhile
to
seek
out
but
not
one
i
would
go
after
all
the
time
i
dont
like
beer
bitter
and
sort
of
bland
a
first
in
tripel
style
i
tasted
overall
pretty
tasty
and
has
some
sweet
but
i
didnt
enjoy
aftertaste
much
maybe
im
just
nw
to
it
however
that
aside
smell
and
taste
were
enjoyable
good
beer
body
carbonation
and
bitterness
are
at
perfect
level
i
believe
this
beer
has
the
best
feel
of
all
ive
tasted
cant
get
on
the
bandwagon
hype

a

me

my

ever
if
you
ever
could
take
one
beer
with
you
this
would
be
the
one
wow
smooth
strong
and
delicious
overall
the
flavor
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
i
am
thinking
that
i
possibly
got
an
old
beer
or
that
it
wasnt
shippedstored
properly
since
the
best
by
date
was
6815
the
beer
was
also
very
highly
carbonated
as
it
started
to
foam
over
the
bottles
lip
upon
opening
i
have
heard
this
can
be
a
symptom
of
a
bad
beer
o
delicious
a
beautifully
crafted
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
im
truly
enjoying
this
glass
right
now
and
its
getting
even
better
as
it
warms
up
just
a
touch
ill
be
back
to
this
one
again
for
sure
best
tripel
i
have
had
beautiful
looking
the
ripe
pear
aroma
is
just
perfect
and
the
taste
so
complex
i
wont
even
begin
to
try
to
describe
it

class

monks
pub
downtown
chicago
i
enjoyed
this
bottled
beer
but
i
typically
prefer
draft
beer
the
look
and
smell
were
somewhat
neutral
i
like
the
taste
not
as
heavy
or
strong
as
i
expected
but
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
i
like
this
beer
and
would
like
to
find
a

version
at
some
point
down
the
road
one
of
my
favorites
from
trapist
nice
very
damn
nice
i
say
ive
had
this
beer
probably
35
times
before
i
never
quite
liked
it
until
this
sample
today
i
think
i
was
getting
skunked
or
old
bottles
in
the
past
maybe
the
yeast
was
stirred
up
a
bit
they
all
had
this
flavor
i
didnt
quite
like
a
staleness
which
was
a
turn
off
i
couldnt
quite
understand
why
people
kept
calling
this
tripel
one
of
the
best
today
i
had
a
bottle
which
was
fantastic
this
is
what
a
tripel
should
be
estery
and
dry
peppery
aftertaste
the
color
is
pale
gold
nice
white
head
with
good
retention
improves
as
it
warms
not
a
fan
of
the
initial
smell
but
this
too
improves
as
the
beer
sits
for
a
few
minutes
overall
i
loved
this
bottle
now
i
know
what
all
the
hype
was
about
overall
i
generally
dont
care
for
bitter
beers
but
this
is
proving
an
exception
a
lot
going
on
here
i
was
very
pleased
and
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
well
i
took
to
this
brew
tad
expensive
but
i
will
certainly
buy
again
drinking
this
is
a
experience
smooth
and
tasty
mouthfeel
silky
and
creamy
light
golden
honey
color
with
tints
of
orange
big
white
head
apricots
and
banana
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
pepper
peppery
taste
upfront
with
noticeable
alcohol
then
honey
and
banana
a
hint
of
citrus
and
yes
pineapple
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
good
stuff
overall
but
not
as
close
to
perfection
as
their
dubbel
when
i
someday
get
a
beer
fridge
this
will
be
a
regular
inclusion
overall
its
from
belgium
and
its
a
tripel
so
it
was
pretty
much
a
given
that
id
like
this
and
i
do
for
something
that
nearly
hits
double
figures
abvwise
its
extremely
drinkable
without
tasting
like
paint
stripper
ive
got
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
so
itll
be
interesting
to
see
how
aging
treats
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
quite
wellbalanced
for
how
boozy
it
is
betraying
this
only
in
the
nose
bottled
05162011
poured
a
hazy
yellowishorange
color
with
a
half
inch
head
that
slowly
dissipated
to
a
thin
film
that
laced
nicely
aroma
was
a
bit
subdued
with
some
pepper
banana
clove
and
funky
yeasty
notes
the
flavor
was
outstanding
with
some
citrus
flowery
grassy
and
bready
notes
coming
through
the
mouthfeel
was
light
somewhat
dry
with
a
great
finish
perfect
carbonation
sets
off
the
mouthfeel
nicely
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
the
time
in
the
cellar
really
melded
all
the
complex
flavors
perfectly
overall
an
excellent
classic
example
of
the
style
triples
are
typically
not
my
desired
style
of
mine
as
this
warmed
it
just
got
worse
for
me
malty
for
a
triple
with
notes
of
pineapple
and
cotton
candy
pours
a
beautiful
three
fingered
head
on
top
of
a
mildly
hazy
golden
straw
body
into
a
spiegelau
tulip
glass
tastes
of
glorious
amounts
of
yeast
and
what
seem
like
ever
changing
light
fruit
flavors
with
the
delightful
mouthpuffing
carbonation
that
is
typical
of
the
finest
belgian
ale
finishes
with
a
mild
astringency
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
worlds
finest
pours
clear
yellow
with
a
hint
of
an
orange

tons
of

that
makes
a
gorgeous

bubbles
pouring

peppery

with

of

overalldrinkability
nice
beer
goes
down
easy
overall
a
really
great
tripel
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
recommend
highly
has
a
beautiful
balance
of
wheat
sugar
and
some
bitter
hoppy
notes
perfect
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
ending
supported
by
the
carbonation
which
is
present
but
not
distracting
adds
freshness
to
the
beer
no
spices
present
but
a
nice
bitterness
at
the
end
which
goes
along
with
an
overall
sweet
character
lovely
combination
bitterness
never
grows
too
present
simply
put
this
is
an
incredible
beer
super
clean
and
dry
with
lots
of
great
hearty
bread
notes
and
a
touch
of
fruity
sweetness
incredibly
brisk
and
refreshing
vinous
like
character
great
replacement
for
champagne
o
not
quite
the
knockout
tripel
i
was
expecting
based
on
the
reputation
but
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
from
bomber
at
home
for
a
triple
this
is
very
light
in
color
aroma
taste
i
dont
mind
any
of
that
since
its
a
damn
fine
brew
all
busy
in
the
glass
the
head
is
a
fine
cake
of
pure
white
floating
on
a
blonde
lake
of
subtlety
everything
here
is
low
key
except
the
enjoyment
which
it
is
in
the
extreme
balanced
sweetness
dry
medium
body
despite
all
this
comfy
talk
this
is
a
memorable
bottle
o
a
very
drinkable
number
this
is
the
best
triple
i
have
come
across
by
far
and
although
i
was
once
not
a
fan
of
the
style
this
has
converted
me
hazy
honey
gold
with
a
towering
head
of
lumpy
froth
that
lasts
awhile
aroma
is
a
beautifully
smooth
blend
of
doughy
yeast
dried
fruit
flowers
oranges
spicy
phenols
and
sugar
cookies
a
little
alcohol
hovers
over
it
all
but
isnt
a
distraction
the
flavor
follows
the
same
plan
and
further
highlights
the
artful
blending
of
flavors
that
is
bold
yet
easy
to
handle
spicy
peppery
yeast
apple
orange
flowers
and
a
soft
pale
malt
sweetness
all
in
a
tidy
damn
near
crisp
package
fluffy
and
dry
not
wearing
down
the
palate
with
sweetness
or
overbearing
yeast
just
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
for
9
5
abv
its
been
too
long
since
ive
had
one
of
these
o
not
my
favorite
belgian
style
as
i
prefer
a
dark
quad
but
this
beer
does
a
great
job
being
a
tripel
as
long
as
you
expect
a
tripel
trappist
beers
are
quite
simply
the
standard
by
which
most
other
beers
should
be
measured
as
far
as
quality
of
ingredients
and
passion
of
brewing
im
a
fan
overall
what
a
monster
of
a
beer
the
flavor
is
so
complex
and
inyourface
its
very
hard
to
believe
there
wasnt
fruit
and
spices
added
to
this
i
just
finished
that
little
bottle
and
im
pretty
sure
i
caught
a
decent
buzz
unfortunately
i
feel
like
the
alcohol
presence
becomes
astringent
and
just
too
absrasive
in
this
beer
which
is
really
holding
it
back
from
a
very
high
rating
still
a
tasty
interesting
beer
just
not
my
favorite
tripel
gotta
say
this
is
definitely
very
good
i
would
not
go
as
far
as
to
call
it
worldclass
but
it
definitely
beats
most
brews
out
there
first
off
it
is
overly
sweet
if
you
like
sugary
beers
then
this
is
definitely
worldclass
it
is
smooth
and
goes
down
real
easy
and
i
think
the
biggest
appeal
to
this
beer
is
that
it
can
go
with
any
meal

oz

yellow
in

with
a

little

the
westmalle
dubbel
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
so
i
had
very
high
hopes
for
this
one
and
it
didnt
disappoint
the
sweet
aroma
of
fresh
fruit
is
top
notch
the
taste
hits
with
sweet
ripe
banana
initially
then
rush
of
earthy
spices
and
herbs
that
blends
in
with
perfection
the
carbonation
is
excellent
and
the
finish
is
hoppy
but
sweet
and
very
crisp
the
alcohol
is
surprisingly
under
control
for
a
9
5
abv
and
it
seems
to
linger
a
bit
in
the
background
its
an
amazingly
engineered
trippel
it
seems
that
every
trappiststyle
ale
that
comes
out
of

is

overall
a
very
good
beer
not
the
best
trappist
ive
had
doesnt
say
much
since
theyre
all
amazing
but
still
a
very
good
one
i
enjoyed
the
apple
flavor
faint
but
definitely
there
like
biting
into
a
freah
apple
right
off
the
tree
ok
the
nice
buzz
from
this
is
very
pleasant
overall
a
wonderfully
crafted
beer
and
a
must
try
for
belgian
lovers
serve
this
closer
to
room
temperature
as
the
flavours
grow
bolder
yet
simultaneously
light
and
sweeter
pours
a
nice
yellow
foams
quite
a
bit
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
some
citrus
and
some
caramel
or
alcohol
taste
is
very
good
its
like
drinking
a
very
nice
belgian
blond
but
with
added
abv
the
taste
of
the
tripel
makes
you
stop
from
chugging
it
down
body
is
stringy
light
overall
its
a
decent
beer
at
best
its
not
a
belgian
beer
id
rush
to
the
store
to
buy
it
was
almost
one
dimensional
in
its
spiced
herbal
character
id
like
to
see
a
larger
yeast
quality
and
more
sour
notes
but
this
is
a
decent
beer
overall
ooverall
this
was
perfect
after
a
hot
day
very
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
very
complex

an

that

to
like
but
whose
achievements
are
just
lost
on
me
due

nevertheless
i
figure
that
there
are
probably
some

aficionados
out

who
would
be

at

to
try
a
worldclass

are
wondering

if
you
like

youll
love
this
ale
if
you
love

probably
not

4

excellent
beer
light
bubbly
refreshing
and
a
real
kick
in
the
pants
somehow
the
monks
at
westmalle
have
figured
out
how
to
up
the
abv
without
altering
the
basic
and
delicious
taste
of
a
belgian
ale
this
beer
is
legendary
for
a
reason
and
while
it
is
not
perfect
few
things
are
it
is
certainly
worth
a
purchase
in
fact
if
you
are
a
fan
of
belgian
beers
you
must
try
this
tripel
you
will
not
be
disappointed
o
what
can
i
say
about
westmalle
it
is
the
quintessential
belgian
tripel
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
beer
that
started
my
love
affair
with
belgian
ales
in
the
winter
i
always
have
a
stock
of
chimay
blue
and
the
summer
is
always
westmalle
season
in
my
house
nothing
better
than
a
westmalle
triple
with
some
irish
style
bbq
othis
one
is
awesome
ive
tried
countless
american
belgian
style
tripels
this
is
the
one
that
theyre
all
trying
to
be
when
they
grow
up
absolutely
as
good
as
it
gets
i
think
this
beer
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
tripel
style
beer
this
beer
is
so
smooth
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
with
an
ipa
or
something
thats
very
hoppy
if
u
drink
this
beer
stick
with
it
and
enjoy
the
smoothness

overall
solid
as
expected
though
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
as
i
like
a
tad
more
sweetness
o
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
ever
had
granted
it
is
quite
expensive
and
i
only
bought
it
because
it
was
30
off
but
still
even
at
full
price
its
quite
an
experience
i
highly
recommend
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
because
of
its
amazing
smell
and
the
fact
that
it
drinks
very
smooth
this
one
has
definitely
to
be
drunk
at
room
temperature
outstanding
tripel
that
does
not
carry
some
characteristics
of
some
belgian
beers
that
bothers
me
a
bit
such
as
being
overly
sweet
or
completely
neglecting
hops
when
not
necessarily
appropriate
amazing
this
is
so
old
and
still
one
of
the
most
modern
tripel
around
favorite
beer
in
the
world
delightful
young
or
old
rich
golden
hazy
appearance
light
lacy
head
full
of
flavor
rich
and
full
then
finishing
crisp
with
nice
bitter
profile
not
overwhelming
alcohol
would
buy
over
and
over
again
drank
a
few
that
had
aged
12mo
and
a
more
complex
robust
flavor
was
experienced
a
very
nice
tripel
but
im
not
sure
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
prefer
a
couple
new
world
tripels
like
long
strange
tripel
and
la
fin
du
monde
pale
hazy
golden
yellow
with
overflowing
head
yeasty
and
slightly
alcoholic
and
sweet
on
the
nose
with
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
very
well
balanced
sweetness
to
bitterness
with
great
carbonation
and
body
this
is
my
first
try
of
a
trappist
beer
and
this
one
is
super
o
delightful
beer
with
flavors
that
keep
unfolding
as
this
warms
up
top
notch
yeast
and
fresh
clean
tasting
ingredients
play
credit
to
meticulous
brewing
practices
and
a
stand
out
beer
i
have
passed
this
up
many
times
but
glad
to
finally
sit
down
and
taste
it
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
slowly
before
dinner
and
didnt
dare
eat
any
food
with
it
to
muddle
the
taste
it
was
well
worth
the
money
love
the
fact
that
this
seems
just
a
hair
different
from
the
other
triples
and
belgians
in
the
pale
family
ive
tried
there
is
no
banana
no
bubble
gum
nothing
cloying
about
it
hazy
light
gold
body
thin
foam
that
doesnt
last
long
but
the
lacing
makes
up
for
it
a
bit
nice
fruity
esters
in
the
aroma
that
are
reflected
in
the
flavor
great
feel
in
the
palate
just
wished
is
had
more
retention
for
the
head
hazy
bright
straw
yellow
color
with
huge
foamy
bright
white
head
lacing
clings
to
glass
in
clumps
herbal
earthy
aroma
typical
belgian
yeast
esters
pale
malt
taste
is
actually
more
mild
a
bit
of
a
peppery
aftertaste
though
medium
body
higher
carbonation
overall
pretty
nice
definitely
to
style
hazy
yelloworange
pour
huge
aroma
of
grape
citrus
apricot
sweet
fruit
filled
pastry
bit
of
farm
flavor
hits
with
the
spice
lemon
zest
so
much
zing
and
bite
very
intense
gonna
have
to
try
this
at
a
later
date
and
re
review
only
had
one
small
bottle
complex
but
drinkable
o
a
very
nice
tripel
with
a
lot
of
character
i
really
liked
the
spice
and
pepperyness
of
this
beer
i
found
this
beer
got
even
better
as
it
came
to
room
temperature
all
the
cards
on
the
table
i
prefer
the
dubbel
over
this
but
it
is
still
a
damn
fine
beer
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
creamy
thick
head
nothing
unique
in
the
aroma
typical
or
maybe
this
one
sets
the
standard
for
belgian
tripels
personally
i
thought
the
alcohol
came
across
stronger
than
the
9
5
stated
but
it
was
still
smooth
and
balanced
viscosity
was
a
bit
thicker
leaving
an
obvious
coating
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
it
didnt
last
long
and
the
aftertaste
was
earthy
and
a
bit
fruity
i
love
belgian
tripels
so
it
is
rare
that
i
can
score
one
average
or
lower
overall
i
like
this
much
better
than
my
only
other
trappist
brew
which
was
orval
i
highly
recommend
this
one
and
would
buy
another
in
a
heart
beat
overall
quite
a
drinkable
tripel
but
probably
not
the
best
i
have
had
particularly
since
it
is
one
of
the
dearest
it
is
more
sour
and
tart
than
most
which
i
like
but
it
lacks
some
complexity
that
said
it
does
have
a
wonderful
orchard
fruit
and
spice
flavour
that
pokes

the

appearance
and
smell
were
definitely
above
average
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
excellent
aftertaste
held
well
and
was
also
excellent
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
triple
clear
golden
white
head
with
good
retention
in
the
nose
a
really
pleasant
fruity
and
spicy
maltiness
is
in
second
plan
but
it
is
a
really
balance
aroma
in
the
taste
fruitness
is
less
intense
the
earthiness
is
present
and
the
biterness
too
great
beer
acredito
que
ela
seja
a
representante
máxima
do
estilo
não
vejo
defeitos
nela
é
totalmente
condizente
com
a
proposta
tripel
trapista
uma
cerveja
com
muita
personalidade
força
e
qualidade
uma
ótima
introdução
para
quem
quer
conhecer
o
universo
belga
de
cerveja
com
certeza
um
dos
melhores
rótulo
que
já
provei
ogreat
beer
that
had
many
things
going
on
at
the
same
time
a
teriffic
tripel
o
great
beer
i
should
have
cooled
a
bit
more
o
i
really
love
the
tripels
that
arent
too
focused
on
being
sweet
this
one
is
very
great
o
not
exactly
a
beer
you
can
really
put
down
not
something
i
would
recommend
for
game
day
but
a
powerful
and
delectable
tasting
beer
with
abv
to
boot
it
is
obvious
that
this
beer
was
brewed
with
intense
dedication
anyone
seeking
a
rewarding
tripel
will
be
more
than
impressed

the

the
aroma
was
quite
strong
with
big
biscuity

and
yeasty
funk
tasting
it
i
again
got
the
huge
biscuit
notes
which
were
balanced
with
slight
yeast
bitterness
i
tasted
spice
grass
and
a
bit
of
banana
to
add
the
slightest
touch
of
sweetness
in
an
overall

wonderful

o
one
of
my
favorites
best
triple
ive
had
second
best
is
achel
blond
really
good
tripel
it
is
a
bit
on
the
winey
side
for
what
i
would
ordinarily
drink
butbeing
belgianit
doesnt
come
off
like
a
slap
in
the
face
the
presentation
is
about
perfect
the
smell
hints
at
whats
to
come
but
doesnt
spoil
the
surprise
the
taste
is
sublime
but
is
different
from
most
tripels
that
i
have
had
allinall
it
is
a
worthy
beer
which
i
would
have
again
and
is
very
much
worth
finding
the
best
tripel
in
the
world
period
o
my
first
tripel
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
although
you
can
tell
there
is
alcohol
in
both
the
taste
and
on
the
nose
this
feels
sessionable
to
me
definitely
shouldnt
session
it
though
maybe
not
the
best
tripel
to
start
off
on
if
youre
new
to
the
style
but
it
worked
for
me
i
felt
like
i
was
having
fun
drinking
this
beer
the
fluffy
appearance
the
boozy
and
spicy
tastes
and
the
bubblybutsmooth
feeling
as
it
went
down
must
try
it
if
given
the
chance
o
i
kind
of
wanted
more
depth
but
as
a
means
of
creating
an
easy
drinker
without
much
palpable
booze
its
a
roaring
success
i
think
the
fact
that
im
not
a
huge
tripel
fan
has
something
to
do
with
me
not
giving
this
some
score
well
over
4
like
im
wont
to
do
with
anything
made
by
monks
in
belgium
id
also
love
to
compare
it
sidebyside
with
la
fin
du
monde
o
great
beer
i
would
drink
again
but
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
considering
the
hype
o
a
strong
floral
nose
and
flavor
makes
this
stand
out
like
drinking
peonies
or
roses
o
enjoyable
and
quite
easydrinking
perhaps
underwhelming
considering
the
big
expectations
but
still
a
very
good
beer
the
subdued
nose
surprised
me
as
i
was
expecting
to
get
more
fruity
notes
this
didnt
entirely
affect
the
taste
as
plenty
of
flavor
emerges
id
certainly
drink
again
especially
as
the
6
price
tag
was
reasonable
it
tastes
a
lot
like
it
smells
with
for
me
the
pepper
andor
cloves
coming
to
forefront
on
the
palate
it
has
a
very
light
and
airy
mouthfeel
with
some
nice
bubble
fuzz
leaves
my
mouth
with
a
doughy
sort
of
after
taste
this
is
a
quality
brew
id
love
to
get
a
few
more
and
experiment
with
some
cellar
aging
o
wonderful
beer
im
starting
to
enjoy
tripels
more
and
more
o
ive
sampled
a
few
other
tripels
and
this
didnt
really
stand
out
as
being
great
it
hid
the
booze
quite
well
but
as
with
westmalle

i
couldnt
say
i
was

this
doesnt

enough
bitterness
to
notice
without
getting
in
the
way
of
other
flavors
a
nice
clean
impression
i
could
brew
a
bucket
of
this
and
probably
will
at
some
point
the
westmalle

a
strong

it
has
a
great

poured
with
a
nice

the
flavor
was
strong

well
but
was
great
the
after
taste
was
the
cause
for
concern
my
girlfriend
likened
it
to
gasoline
although
i
didnt
mind
too
much
it
does
go
straight
to

opens
them

for
the

this
one
was
one
of
my
first
favorite
beers
and
i
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
this
is
a
terrific
gateway
beer
for
noncraft
drinkers
the
taste
contained
notes
of
bananas
and
cloves
which
was
surprising
perhaps
notes
of
fresh
pears
and
datesfigs
with
a
spicy
and
boozy
finish
the
brew
settled
into
my
belly
with
a
comfy
warmth
to
be
expected
from
a

abv
i
gotta
hand
it
to
these
trappist
monks
if
i
wasnt
getting
laid
i
guess
id
be
brewing
the
best
damn
beer
i
could
theyve
done
well
here
im
a
fan
of
boozy
trappist
brews
and
this
ranks
up
high
on
my
short
list
without
a
doubt
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
overall
a
nice
and
clasic
apricoty
tripel
that
i
am
glad
to
say
i
have
had
this
is
one
that
i
would
go
to
if
i
wanted
an
imported
tripel
that
said
although
classic
there
are
still
at
least
a
good
five
tripels
that
i
can
count
that
i
would
turn
to
before
this
one
especially
with
the
higher

price
point

10

bottle
just
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
this
has
cellared
well
seamless
i
used
to
recall
this
as
my
favourite
tripel
and
favourite
trappist
beer
this
doesnt
do
much
to
alter
that
opinion
o
this
is
an
incredible
beer
sweet
yeasty
and
tasty
this
brew
just
satisfies
in
every
way
one
of
the
greats
westmalle
tripel
is
a
beer
that
you
should
definitely
try
if
you
have
the
opportunity
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
o
a
nononsense
tripel
that
begs
to
be
appreciated
through
small
sips
rjt
overall
solid
classic
and
one
of
the
best
many
more
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
future
overall
impression
certainly
more
drinkable
than
a
quad
this
ale
bears
similar
taste
resemblance
to
a
german
hefeweizen
however
its
medium
body
roundness
of
malt
character
and
lack
of
wheaty
astringency
make
it
easily
discardable
if
those
characteristics
were
not
enough
the
obvious
belgian
influence
is
easily
recognized
in
the
yeast
complexity
overall
not
bad
not
my
favorite
trappist
beer
but
pretty
good
the
alcoholic
content
is
well
masked
pairs
well
with
some
good
belgian
frites
in
fact
i
started
eating
some
between
writing
this
and
posting
it
the
beer
is
exponentially
better
with
the
fries
this
beer
is
outstanding
cultivated
and
refined
its
not
assuming
but
it
is
assured
and
significant
in
its
exceptional
character
a
well
done
tripel
like
this
is
a
sweet
delight
o
i
served
this
beer
a
little
too
warm
but
it
is
still
a
great
beer
o
best
tripel
i
have
had
t
in
a
word
unbalanced
stays
between
big
flavors
of
sweet
belgian
yeast
and
a
pretty
substantial
bretty
funk
flavor
aspirin
and
heavy
bready
malt
as
well
again
i
dont
think
this
bottle
is
right
ill
revisit
and
rewrite
if
necessary
pair
this
beer
with
the
finer
things
in
life
such
as
chateau
briand
new
zealand
lamb
or
filet
minion
with
properly
prepared
escargot
and
buttery
vegetables
this
beer
and
pairing
is
second
to
none
a
fine
tripel
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
might
buy
another
one
of
these
down
the
road
as
soon
as
i
finish
the
other
beers
in
my
closet
i
had
this
blind
taste
tested
with
chimay
and
la
fin
du
monde
this
came
in
second
with
la
fin
being
first
this
is
however
where
you
want
if
you
dont
prefer
sweet
and
fruitiness
but
want
some
more
strong
flavors
with
booze
bitterness
and
vinous
flavors
overall
an
outstanding
abbey
trippel
which
is
almost
too
easy
to
drink
for
its
strength
superb
overall
this
is
perhaps
the
benchmark
for
the
tripel
style
and
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
truly
perfection
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
worldclass
overall
finally
got
to
try
this
very
nice
a
bit
more
alcohol
bite
than
expected
in
a
good
way
the
westmallest
bernardus
showdown
was
the
penultimate
in
a
month
of
tripels
with
westmalle
winning
easily
only
tripel
karmeleit
vs
la
fin
du
monde
remains
o
a
great
tripel
a
nice
sweetness
with
great
spiciness
that
remains
balanced
and
complex
o
westmalle
is
a
real
world
class
beer
not
too
expensive
and
very
unique
one
of
my
favourites
beers
everyone
should
try
this
liquid
treasure
once
in
the
live
very
nice
belgian
yeast
ester
character
and
an
excellent
balance
of
sweetness
and
dryness
i
first
had
this
beer
about
18
months
ago
and
was
given
this
larger
bottle
as
a
gift
about
5
months
ago
westmalle
tripel
is
very
interesting
and
unique
but
i
suppose
i
find
most
trappist
ales
that
way
as
well
its
a
good
beer
its
refreshing
and
the
right
choice
tonight
as
its
still
really
warm
right
now
ill
definitely
grab
another
big
bottle
or
several
smaller
cheers
o
im
not
sure
whats
going
on
with
the
flavor
in
this
but
its
not
really
doing
it
for
me
the
aroma
is
quite
appealing
though
muted
im
a
little
let
down
since
this
is
supposed
to
be
somewhat
of
a
classic
o
this
is
now
my
third
favourite
belgian
pale
ale
the
beer
is
heavybodied
with
moderate
carbonation
that
gently
foams
this
up
on
the
palate
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
smooth
and
foamy
ethanol
heat
is
easily
felt
across
the
palate
in
the
nostrils
and
on
the
back
of
the
throat
this
ones
strength
isnt
that
deceptive
closes
semidry
with
moderate
stickiness
left
on
the
palate
o
good
beer
but
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
tripels
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
bananafruit
component
and
make
a
bit
less
bitters
but
overall
its
solid
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
my
favorite
trappist
trippel
so
far
perhaps
not
as
magnificient
as
a
rochefort
10
but
the
complexity
of
this
one
can
hold
its
own
so
smooth
and
flavorful
this
is
a
very
unique
amazing
belgian
beer
that
any
beer
advocate
should
try
bottled
may
2012
o
complex
the
alcohol
could
be
blended
better
but
the
spicy
fruity
flavor
is
very
interesting
and
worth
trying
to
taste
90100
overall
i
like
this
beer
is
it
worthy
of
its
top
250
status
on
our
page
maybe
not
but
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
othe
spice
bite
is
great
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
balance
a
great
tripel
o
a
wonderful
beer
that
took
me
way
too
long
to
try
paired
nicely
with
cypress
groves
purple
haze
chevre
the
taste
is
tangy
sour
and
almost
vinegar
like
some
citrus
or
fruitiness
but
the
tanginess
is
overbearing
a
bit
acidic
and
metallic
theres
hints
of
pear
in
the
backdrop
just
too
tangy
for
my
palate
perhaps
this
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
must
say
im
disappointed
in
this
tripel
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
always
wants
to
drink
cause
of
the
quite
high
abv
warm
and
slight
carbonation
on
the
mouthfeel
very
nice
tripel
but
that
shouldnt
come
as
a
surprise
most
people
have
come
to
expect
greatness
from
all
of
the
trappist
breweries
and
why
shouldnt
they
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
very
good
nonetheless
o
very
nice
world
class
tripel
not
quite
as
good
as
la
fin
du
monde
but
pretty
close
good
drinkability
and
the
abv
is
hidden
well
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
this
was
probably
sitting
at
room
temp
for
a
long
time
at
the
liquor
store
o
this
beer
is
a
real
experience
for
those
that
enjoy
belgianbelgianstyle
beers
the
balance
complexities
and
approachability
are
expertly
done
at
9
5
this
beer
is
big
but
is
so
soft
and
smooth
the
integration
of
sweetness
yeasty
spice
and
hop
bitterness
is
a
work
of
art
deserving
of
meditation
contemplation
and
conscious
enjoyment
im
a
big
fan
of
belgian
beers
so
take
that
into
account
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
come
across
thus
far
overall
to
try
this
is
a
must
its
super
complex
and
elegant
this
is
definitely
one
of
if
not
the
best
triple
ive
had
and
one
of
the
best
beers
overall
ive
had
and
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
who
isnt
even
into
tripples
that
much
lovely
tripel
crazy
drinkable
and
delicious
it
flows
together
pretty
seamlessly
i
wouldnt
have
objected
to
the
taste
being
a
bit
more
aggressive
on
the
palate
but
it
tastes
great
the
alcohol
is
hidden
and
has
a
good
complexity
i
quite
like
this
beer
bit
of
a
pricetag
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
o
nice
tripel
bitter
citrus
rind
grows
on
you
or
mellows
as
it
warms
pours
nicely
head
is
bright
and
frothy
aroma
is
buttery
and
maybe
a
little
spicy
taste
is
complex
and
does
not
develop
instantly
which
i
love
flavor
develops
from
front
to
back
slowly
and
reaches
its
peak
at
the
back
of
the
throat
and
leaves
a
little
bit
of
dryness
not
too
much
very
good
balance
i
like
that
it
has
a
high
abv
while
not
overwhelming
the
balance
i
want
more
the
odor
was
of
butter
and
pepper
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
at
first
sip
but
it
is
contrasted
with
a
malty
sweetness
and
full
body
which
distracts
from
any
potential
unpleasantness
hops
could
be
the
origin
of
the
spicy
flavor
and
odor
as
their
bitterness
floats
above
the
malty
blonde
brew
when
eaten
with
cheese
it
is
reminiscent
of
hop
candy
sweet
and
floral
o
westmalle
has
always
had
a
special
place
in
my
heart
its
a
beer
to
sit
down
relax
and
just
enjoy
the
pale
amber
tricks
you
right
from
the
beginning
its
beautiful
and
leaves
you
perplexed

about
this

miles

some
other
triples

had

tripels
made
here
in

are

rest
heavily
on
the
belgian
candi
sugars
they
get

saturated

something

brew
you
know
you
are
drinking
alcohol
and
after

those

it
has
an

with

aroma
is
a
blend
of
bright
aromatic
hops
and
subtle
spicey
yeast
esters
amazingly
balanced
and
showing

here
cereal

support
a

that
is

not
highly
toned
great
interplay

flavors
not

truly
dominates
a

the

is

we
were

at

and
some
bready

backbone
the
flavor
is
delicate
a
dry
with
a
fair
btt
of
honey
sweetness
d
its
a
bit
more
intense
than
other
tripels
ive
had
because
of
the
spice
and
thickness
not
exactly
easydrinking
but
very
rich
and
rewarding
chad
d
wow
i
should
take
up
afternoon
drinking
and
make
this
my
staple
for
reputation
and
how
pretty
it
looked
coming
out
of
the
bottles
a
bit
of
a
let
down
alcohol
warms
you
well
most
noticeably
in
the
cheeks
and
jaw
strange
to
think
you
can
localize
the
alcohol
effects
in
your
body
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
in
the
aroma
dry
candy
sugar
hints
of
fruit
and
a
nice
yeast
presence
in
the
taste
candy
sugar
and
fruit
notes
all
mellow
and
a
dryness
that
rides
all
the
way
through
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
hint
of
fruit
best
representation
of
style
ever
pours
a
cloudy
honeylike
deep
yellow
with
an
ample
head
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
on
the

aroma
is
lemon
peel
honey
coriander
bready
yeast
very
crisp
light
taste
very
bright
and
refreshing
with
a
hoppy
dryness
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
so
full
but
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
it
doesnt
feel
syrupy
drinkability
is
good
it
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
d
the
flavor
and
nose
is
ok
but
the
sharp
bittter
dry
duration
is
the
best
part
of
this
brew
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
its
below
the
baseline
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
medium
to
full
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
very
drinkable
considering
the
wellblended

abv
i
would
recommend
this
beer
but
would
advise
one
to
keep
his
or
her
expectations
in
check
going
in
i
was
prepared
to
be
blown
away
and
that
just
didnt
happen
unfortunately
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
bur
the
flavor
was
not
my
favorite
in
this
style
its
drinkable
but
given
the
dryness
i
doubt
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting

poured
into
leffe

mouthfeeldrinkability
a
bit
under
medium

this
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
perfect
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
hidden
extremely
well
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
one
of
the
best
tripels
out
there
d
great
belgian
sipper
over
all
slightly
to
dry
for
my
liking
and
not
as
complex
as
im
used
to
with
this
style
a
great
beer
aging
this
really
didnt
sway
me
its
just
as
good
aged
or
fresh
im
almost
leaning
more
towards
fresh
buts
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
it
fresh
highly
recommend
tripel
one
of
the
best
light
body
makes
this
smooth
and
creamy
high
carbonation
drinkability
was
slightly
above
average
since
it
was
something
that
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
multiple
bottles
of
in
one
sitting
serving
type
bottle
d
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
making
this
beer
trouble
if
youve
got
a
750
of
it
its
very
drinkable
with
great
balance
based
on
the
date
im
sure
its
got
some
age
on
it
and
its
still
terrific
notes
my
first
westmalle
tripel
and
it
is
freakin
awesome
love
the
up
front
sweetness
but
the
drying
yeast
great
balance
and
length
d
definitely
something
i
like
to
savor
and
have
just
one
of
nice
i
really
enjoy
the
dryness
but
the
flavor
was
not
to
my
preference
in
the
given
style
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
personally
i
doubt
i
would
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
good
tasting
but
not
too
high
for
drinkability
the
high
alochol
content
and
the
intense
spicy
flavor
one
is
about
all
i
could
take
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
however
but
2
in
row
would
be
pushing
it
shockingly
shockingly
good
im
dumbfounded
next
time
youre
in
your
local
beer
shop
and
you
see
some
of
these
lying
around
make
sure
to
pick
up
a
couple
but
only
if
they
themselves
are
old
enough
to
drink
had
this
both
in
brussels
and
back
home
in
the
states
great
in
both
cases
cloudy
orange
appearance
strong
tasting
beer
with
slight
fruit
undertones
decent
amount
on
carbination
overall
a
very
nice
trappist
beer
i
enjoy
having
it
in
the
westmalle
glass
i
bought
while
in
brussels
overall
a
decent
tripel
but
too
much
carbonation
and
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
showing
somewhat
drinkable
i
dig
a
bit
of
it
bottle
date
on
bottle
says
50811
bottle
opens
with
a
slight
little
pop
pours
a
slightly
hazed
golden
straw
color
with
a
big
bubbled
1
12
finger
head
that
slowly
settles
seems
more
carbonated
than
i
thought
when
i
opened
the
bottle
the
smell
is
rather
clean
with
almost
fruit
like
aromas
like
peach
and
apple
some
spice
in
the
nose
as
well
along
with
banana
pretty
high
carbonation
level
that
in
my
opinion
somewhat
detracts
from
the
flavors
pretty
sweet
up
front
with
a
mix
of
booze
spicy
type
flavors
ends
with
a
lingering
bitterness
ends
pretty
cleanly
good
lace
left
on
the
glass
overall
a
surprisingly
light
bodied
well
carbed
nectar
that
drinks
way
easier
than
it
should
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
it
has
makes
me
wonder
how
many
tourists
in
belgium
just
got
rocked
on
this
by
accident
d
this
tripel
doesnt
mask
the
high
alcohol
the
way
others
do
making
this
beer
a
little
less
drinkable
but
this
tripel
retains
the
simplicity
of
its
trappist
brewery
and
the
great
balance
of
its
style
making
it
perhaps
the
canvas
for
others
to
draw
and
expand
upon
overall
a
highly
drinkable
tripel
and
really
quite
different
that
what
expected
but
in
a
good
way
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
big
white
head
smells
of
vanilla
and
solvent
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
medicine
up
front
with
a
dry
licorice
middle
and
a
earthy
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
super
high
carbonation
that
overflowed
from
the
bottle
when
opened
good
drinkability
very
expensive
for
the
price
there
are
many
others
i
would
rather
purchase
i
will
probably
get
this
again
later
down
the
road
but
it
wont
be
a
regular
purchase
for
me
superb
for
type
but
have
a
solid
preference
for
westmalle
dubbel
tasty
and
well
executed
but
boozy
and
hot
d
a
classic
tripel
that
is
worthy
of
its
reputation
personally
i
prefer
the
st
bernardus
tripel
and
tripel
karmeliet
over
this
offering
again
malt
and
white
flowers
in
the
aftertaste
along
witrh
a
good
and
strong
hoppiness
balancing
the
beer
the
taste
is
not
very
pleasing
to
me
which
is
a
shame
considering
this
is
the
mother
of
all
tripels
however
drinkability
is
still
very
good
and
the
high
alcohol
is
barely
felt
which
is
spot
on
for
this
style
d
copious
amounts
of
alcohol
but
the
dry
finish
helps
counter
that
dthis
was
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
have
again
but
i
have
to
say
it
was
somewhat
coarse
maybe
it
was
an
old
bottle
or
something
like
that
but
it
certainly
was
rougher
than
what
i
expected
poured
into
a
maredsous
goblet
absolutely
beautiful
brew
had
an
explosive
white
head
that
was
very
active
and
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
flecks
of
yeast
were
present
beneath
in
the
brilliant
golden
liquid
below
that
eventually
settled
to
the
bottom
the
smell
hits
you
instantly
and
from
2
feet
away
its
quite
pungent
very
lively
yeast
peppercorn
ripe
fruits
corriander
lemon
and
alcohol
very
noticeable
the
taste
is
a
knockout
the
depth
of
flavor
is
unlike
any
tripel
ive
had
phenol
alcohol
is
not
hidden
and
the
coriander
is
a
great
companion
to
that
its
got
some
grassy
hops
tart
fruits
and
a
wonderfully
earthy
yeast
taste
going
on
excellent
balance
and
very
assertive
its
got
a
medium
body
which
feels
a
bit
thicker
due
to
the
high
carbonation
level
drinkability
for
this
one
is
great
considering
the
abv
maybe
the
only
beer
ive
ever
had
that
felt
and
tasted
like
it
was
alive
best
tripel
ive
tasted
hands
down
pours
a
very
hazy
goldenstraw
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
as
shit
white
head
scent
is
a
tiny
bit
funky
with
a
bit
of
hay
followed
by
amazing
smelling
fruits
apples
pears
bananas
i
also
pick
up
some
yummy
belgian
yeasts
and
spices
taste
is
very
floral
and
a
tad
bit
boozy
i
love
me
boozy
beers
though
i
get
floral
and
fruity
notes
like
crazy
amazing
spiciness
makes
the
alcohol
flowers
and
applesbananaspears
blend
almost
perfectly
the
beers
is
so
bold
and
tasty
its
amazing
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
this
style
and
drinkability
is
great
aroma
was
mild
with
hints
of
hay
lemon
grass
floral
alcohol
tastes
of
flowers
spice
yeast
grass
and
slightly
sweet
flows
over
the
tongue
nicely
with
crisp
carbonation
slightly
dry
finish
with
a
brush
of
alcohol
once
it
warmed
up
i
noticed
the
flavors
really
opened
up
im
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
look
forward
to
having
this
again
this
is
an
amazing
tripel
d
i
wish
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
but
still
quite
nice
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
d
this
is
truly
the
mother
of
all
tripels
and
currently
my
favorite
ale
to
rock
on
its
just
done
so
well
the
mix
is
fantastic
and
for
being
9
5
it
really
goes
down
smooth
the
vibe
of
it
is
great
if
you
have
a
few
too
grab
a
750ml
a
chalice
and
sit
down
and
enjoy
it
all
to
yourself
this
beer
just
opens
up
the
warmer
it
gets
so
let
it
chill
and
you
will
ride
this
brew
to
heaven
drinkability
is
good
but
again
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
relatively
slowly
not
to
chug
aroma
is
dry
champagneish
hay
and
tropical
fruit
and
spiced
pear
i
was
told
that
this
would
be
dry
but
this
is
so
perfectly
crisp
and
dry
that
it
wipes
the
palette
after
each
sip
spicey
and
lightly
sugary
its
heaven
in
a
glass
pours
a
hazy
straw
super
thick
foamy
head
which
dissipates
ever
so
slowly
amazing
lacing
on
this
one
aroma
was
mostly
mild
with
hints
of
hay
floral
and
spring
breeze
tastes
of
flowers
spice
yeast
grass
and
slightly
sweet
bubbles
over
the
tongue
nicely
slightly
dry
finish
with
a
brush
of
alcohol
overall
this
is
an
amazing
tripel
this
is
the
best
tripel
ive
had
there
needs
to
be
a
petition
to
put
westmalle
atop
its
category
down
with
that
canadian
impostor
long
live
westmalle
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
at
room
temperature
maybe
one
of
my
favorites
this
trip
to
europe
westmalle
here
has
captured
everything
transcendent
in
the
belgian
style
my
entire
spirit
is
transfixed
by
what
seems
to
be
a
beer
with
neverending
complexity
could
i
improve
on
this
god
no
dthis
is
a
well
balanced
complex
brew
that
is
quite
good
the
flavors
are
rich
and
the
complexity
is
quite
nice
this
is
a
great
brew
cheers
d
its
no
la
fin
du
monde
which
is
my
favorite
but
this
is
an
excellent
well
crafted
beer
it
could
be
a
little
sweeter
and
fruitier
and
maybe
less
boozy
and
medicinal
but
who
am
i
to
argue
with
a
world
class
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
id
probably
drink
la
fin
chimay
or
st
bernardus
before
this
drier
and
less
spicy
than
others
ive
had
this
is
still
a
tasty
beer
at
7
bucks
a
bottle
it
is
something
id
only
buy
sometimes
among
tripels
i
tend
to
favor
the
sweeter
spicier
ones
so
this
wouldnt
fall
among
the
upper
echelon
drinkability
a
classic
brew
im
alarmed
that
i
havent
tried
until
now
so
thanks
to
the
bros
for
reorganizing
the
top
100
and
reminding
me
to
pick
one
of
these
up
allegedly
the
quintessential
tripel
and
no
surprise
why
it
hits
all
the
high
points
and
hits
them
all
remarkably
well
quenching
and
flavorful
with
a
gorgeous
appearance
and
great
mouth
this
beer
should
be
a
benchmark
the
9
5
is
nowhere
to
be
found
either
a
summer
appertif
if
there
ever
was
one
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
the
carbonation
and
thick
frothy
head
really
give
it
a
thicker
and
creamy
feel
excellent
mouthfeel
for
the
style
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
some
great
flavors
to
it
and
was
nicely
balanced
the
only
thing
that
hurts
it
a
bit
is
the
alcohol
that
comes
through
that
is
a
pretty
small
negative
in
the
big
picture
of
the
beer
though
very
good
beer
for
the
style
overall
overall
a
very
clean
drinkable
tripel
the
large
amount
of
carbonation
hurts
my
ratings
for
drinkablity
taste
changes
as
you
drink
the
first
few
sips
are
about
as
intense
of
belgian
hops
and
malt
as
i
have
ever
had
as
the
beer
airs
out
it
mellows
and
becomes
more
fruity
sweet
and
yet
the
belgian
hops
lemon
peel
is
also
a
major
component
of
this
beer
all
in
all
unique
and
very
refreshing
mouth
feel
is
very
bubbly
and
yet
has
body
alcohol
was
very
warming
at
first
but
seemed
to
mellow
as
the
beer
warmed
a
fine
beer
indeed
jd
an
excellent
tripel
price
is
worth
the
quality
will
definitely
get
it
again
mouthfeel
is
copious
with
carbonation
and
liveliness
very
champagnelike
and
the
drinkability
is
very
easy
and
high
best
tripel
ive
tried
so
far
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
to
try
this
due
to
its
passing
of
the
best
before
date
of
22510
but
i
was
surprised
to
find
it
still
drinking
and
tasting
very
well

entry
into
the
top
100
made
me
realize
id
never
actually
tried
it
pretty
decent
tripel
overall
but
ive
definitely
had
other
examples
of
the
style
ive
enjoyed
much
more
the
flavor
is
strong
and
fruity
much
like
the
nose
simple
pale
malt
with
a
strong
sweetness
up
front
and
a
semidry
finish
the
flavor
that
comes
to
mind
first
is
bannana
split
ice
cream
the
yeast
is
the
main
focus
to
the
flavor
and
is
of
very
high
quality
i
would
like
some
more
hop
flavor
and
a
drier
finish
but
this
hits
the
style
dead
on
there
really
isnt
much
else
im
looking
for
in
a
tripel
this
hits
it
spot
on
d
fits
the
style
well
i
would
guess
that
like
many
brews
the
draft
version
would
be
even
more
tasty
i
wont
pass
up
this
brew
if
i
have
a
chance
in
the
future
to
partake
d
a
damnedfine
tripel
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
good
mouthfeel
with
medium
body
and
carbonation
somehow
really
drinkable
and
satisfying
probably
fulfills
the
digestible
requirement
better
than
any
beer
ive
had
instantly
became
one
of
favorite
beers
a
classic
d
i
am
simply
in
love
with
the
mouthfeel
in
particular
with
this
one
alsothe
nutty
and
fruity
taste
of
the
westmalle
is
addictive
amazing
stuff
overall
one
of
the
finest
beers
i
have
come
across
given
the
chance
i
would
pick
this
one
again
in
a
second
opened
and
it
started
to
flow
out
of
the
bottle
but
i
was
ready
with
an
ommegang
chalice
pours
a
realy
nice
orange
hue
with
some
yellow
in
there
as
well
nice
head
retention
and
some
yeast
at
the
bottom
smell
is
very
understated
you
really
have
to
work
for
it
yeasty
bread
orange
lemon
and
some
banana
in
here
as
well
with
some
belgian
funk
as
well
taste
is
interesting
im
getting
orange
cream
soda
yeast
and
some
bitterness
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
velvet
smooth
with
a
lingering
bitterness
afterwords
i
like
to
have
this
on
occasion
when
im
in
the
mood
for
triples
an
excellent
and
very
drinkable
tripel
that
leans
more
on
the
dry
and
spicy
side
of
things
which
i
like
highly
recommended
d
very
smooth
nice
brew
even
with
the
high
abv
this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
drinkability
ive
had
this
before
and
i
think
i
still
have
yet
to
find
the
right
meal
with
this
beer
it
went
okay
with
fish
and
asparagus
too
strong
of
a
flavor
clash
and
before
it
didnt
really
match
with
a
beef
stew
i
think
this
beer
may
be
best
alone
i
would
not
mind
a
bigger
glass
to
tease
out
all
the
smells
and
flavors
but
im
okay
with
just
having
one
in
an
evening
as
well
11
2
ounce
bottled
poured
into
my
chimay
trappist
glass
im
rating
a
pair
of
tripels
tonight
this
is
my
second
this
one
pours
a
bright
golden
color
thats
hazy
in
appearance
better
head
than
i
was
expecting
with
about
a
quarter
inch
of
soap
suds
around
the
glass
some
pear
and
pineapple
notes
in
the
nose
smells
brighter
than
i
thought
it
would
if
that
makes
sense
first
taste
is
dry
very
dry
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
a
huge
alcoholinfused
finish
as
my
palate
acclimates
i
get
more
citrus
specifically
lemon
and
orange
flavors
theres
some
nice
things
going
on
with
the
malt
in
this
beer
its
almost
sweet
kind
of
like
french
bread
aside
from
the
obvious
alcohol
theres
no
where
for
it
to
hide
after
all
theres
a
nice
bright
finish
to
this
beer
thats
somewhat
citrusy
and
grassy
its
hoppier
than
i
expected
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
criticism
as
i
feel
its
very
well
balanced
some
belgian
beers
have
a
tendency
to
be
overly
sweet
however
that
is
not
the
case
with
westmalle
indeed
its
dry
but
not
overly
so
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
but
not
too
watery
this
is
one
balanced
beer
and
really
well
done
maybe
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
and
thats
saying
something
overall
not
the
best
triple
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
very
good
very
smooth
and
maybe
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
i
have
seen
certainly
worth
a
try
d
decent
over
all
but
to
mild
and
plain
for
my
liking
nicely
carbonated
pleasant
enough
i
suppose
a
solid
refreshing
and
potent
tripel
the
aroma
is
a
little
sour
at
first
but
soon
turns
to
a
milder
duvellike
aroma
of
creamy
pale
malts
the
flavor
is
sweeter
and
maltier
than
the
other
big
trappist
tripel
chimay
white
theres
a
bit
of
farmhouse
funk
in
the
malt
and
drop
of
candy
and
caramel
it
finishes
with
an
obscured
hops
flavor
thats
grapefruity
but
buried
under
the
malt
overall
i
dont
think
the
flavor
is
that
amazing
yes
it
is
quite
nice
but
not
my
favorite
tripel
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
but
a
hint
of
alcohol
detracts
from
it
d
the
gold
standard
of
tripels
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
this
beer
but
if
you
want
you
can
find
some
that
have
expanded
on
this
baseline
i
dont
venture
into
the
belgians
as
often
as
i
used
to
but
glad
to
try
this
one
going
in
i
understood
that
this
was
iconic
for
the
style
and
i
can
see
why
a
very
stately
beer
with
ripe
but
balanced
flavor
and
one
that
masks
its
relatively
high
alcohol
enjoy
it
with
a
meal
though
and
youve
got
no
worries
glad
to
have
tried
it
again
truly
world
class
beer
perfect
for
summer
food
or
most
any
time
you
want
to
indulge
yourself
give
this
to
your
wineloving
friends
and
see
what
they
think
very
little
notice
of
the
alchohol
just
crisp
clean
belgian
goodness
wish
i
could
sip
on
some
of
these
at
fenway
d
medium
to
low
great
brew
but
almost
10
abv
this
is
a
1
and
done
for
me
unless
were
partying
appearance
is
good
enough
head
retains
well
very
effervescent
with
many
flavors
and
feels
to
the
palate
a
citricy
aftertaste
im
a
relative
novice
at
appreciating
complex
beers
so
i
may
change
my
rating
in
the
future
but
so
far
its
good
but
not
worth
the
very
premium
price
overall
since
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
a
careful
pour
will
yield
a
brighter
and
more
clear
beer
but
i
poured
this
into
two
glasses
and
the
second
glass
got
much
more
yeast
than
the
first
if
you
dont
care
for
yeast
in
your
beer
pour
slowly
personally
i
call
small
bits
of
yeast
flavor
crystals
in
my
beer
the
same
goes
for
hop
flakes
though
you
wont
find
those
here
there
is
nothing
overpowering
about
this
beer
and
the
flavors
blend
together
surprisingly
evenly
with
the
alcohol
winning
out
only
slightly
hop
presence
is
minimal
while
the
beer
exhibits
a
noble
spice
given
off
by
the
wesmalle
yeast
drinkability
sneaky
abv
on
this
one
so
crisp
and
refreshing
you
might
think
you
were
drinking
a
beer
with
half
the
actual
alcohol
present
tripels
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
goes
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
it
poures
a
golden
wheat
color
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
the
aroma
consisted
of
sweet
malts
some
floral
aspects
and
a
little
spice
to
it
the
taste
was
just
as
good
as
the
aroma
although
at
9
5
the
drinkability
was
scarily
eeasy
to
consume
this
is
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
had
and
will
be
having
again
drinkability
i
cant
quit
you
its
a
very
tasty
tripel
no
doubt
but
the
apparent
alcohol
in
the
flavor
hinders
the
drinkability
pours
a
nice
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
23
inch
head
which
does
a
number
lacing
your
glass
as
you
drink
it
aroma
is
full
of
faint
spices
and
alcohol
spices
jump
at
you
right
away
on
the
taste
not
much
sweetness
but
a
little
lemon
and
orange
up
front
as
well
yeast
and
breadyness
also
earthy
hops
and
alcohol
lead
to
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
nice
light
mouthfeel
a
good
beer
warm
and
refreshing
d
very
drinkable
in
spite
of
the
high
alcohol
content
the
flavor
is
somewhat
underwhelming
but
it
goes
down
quite
easily
and
is
remarkably
refreshing
its
definitely
the
kind
of
beer
that
would
sneak
up
on
you
over
the
course
of
an
evening
the
color
is
like
dried
apricots
with
a
few
bubbles
and
a
foamy
head
smells
like
tart
apples
taste
is
sweeter
than
expected
and
a
little
doughy
like
apple
strudel
a
crisp
and
full
flavor
mouthfeel
is
velvety
and
carbonated
i
find
this
beer
far
more
drinkable
than
its
high
alcohol
content
would
suggest
d
the
9
5
is
hidden
for
the
most
part
emerging
only
in
the
initial
mouthfeel
intriguing
enough
to
hold
my
interest
over
time
but
not
distractingly
so
solid
delicious
dangerously
drinkable
great
tripel
d
this
was
a
good
drinker
to
say
the
least
i
almost
prefer
this
one
to
most
other
trappist
beers
overall
plus
westy

is
just
so
damn
hard
to
get
d
one
of

favorite
beers
very
complex

profile
but
so
smooth
and
easy
to
just
drink
and
enjoy
for
a
high
abv
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
doesnt
detract
from
the
tasting
experience
highly

a

across

i
have
to
be
honest
im
not
sure
what
the
hype
is
all
about
with
this
beer
it
was
decent
but
the
flavor
profile
was
a
little
lackluster
and
the
carbonation
was
way
too
aggressive
im
a
big
fan
of
trappistbeers
with
the
wide
variaties
you
can
get
from
the
7
different
monasterys
this
westmalle
gives
the
category
a
nice
twist
with
its
lighter
fresher
style
with
alot
of

would
have
loved

try

quite

wonderful

beautiful

and
on

somewhat

this
was
a
great
example
of
a
beer
from
a
style
that
i
normally
dont
care
for
this

is
complex
refreshing

and
downright
tasty
the

is
noticeable
but
in
a
pleasant
way
that
adds
to
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
beer

this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
probably
my
favorite
belgian
d
incredible
beer
with
tons
of
flavor
and
character
not
by
any
means
a
sessionable
beer
but
one
that
could
be
enjoyed
day
after
day
with
no

a
truly
great
beer
d
westmalle
is
a
very
drinkable
tripel
that
i
would
highly

this

one
of
the
finest
trappist
tripels
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
well

d
after
this
session
i
can
say
this
is
always
a

from

never

them
the

these
have
been

had

could

be

as

side
note
this
beer
was
much
better
the
longer
i
had
it
opened
best
drinks
were
towards
the
end
very
memorable
i
dont
want
another
right
now
but
im
still
going
to
buy
another
one
something
tells
me
that
a
couple
years
in
the
dark
will
do
wonders
for
this
beer
but
fresh
id
go
for
orval
this
beer
was
actually
gifted
to
me
so
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
loved
it
great
belgian
ale
i
got
a
kick
out
of
the
appearance
i
actually
like
to
see
a
little
sediment
and
this
one
had
some
resting
on
the
head
til
just
about
the
very
last
drop
this
beer
stands
up
well
on
its
own
or
id
recommend
with
a
light
meal
maybe
some
chicken
or
roasted
veggies
it
was
surprisingly
filling
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
for
me
this
is
the
best
tripel
i
have
ever
had
and
the
one
from
which
all
other
fall
short
of
i
imagine
this
being
a
really
nice
cosy
winters
night
drink
this
is
a
fine
triple
and
i
wish
it
was
produced
more
often
to
keep
the
price
down
very
nice
very
well
balanced
those
monks
really
know
what
they
are
doing
the
taste
and
feel
are
a
creamy
alcoholic
fruitiness
mostly
raisins
grapes
and
a
little
stewed
pear
with
a
bite
it
has
a
tingly
quality
along
with
herbs
citrus
grain
amazing
aroma
color
was
also
a
great
golden
and
a
bit
cloudy
color
out
of
12oz
bottle
a
bit
of
astringancy
acidty
and
almost
sour
that
hits
the
mid
in
a
weird
way
though
this
dicipated
after
a
couple
minutes
im
guessing
the
palate
adjusted
lived
up
to
the
hype
classic
belgium
texture
filled
it
later
but
the
aroma
some
salt
butter
hint
of
burnt
sugar
way
in
the
back
something
to
behold
d
great
beer
always
a
good
selection
with
a
good
complexity
i
wish
i
had
another
one
notes
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
and
i
was
not
dissapointed
really
one
of
the
great
beers
in
my
opinion
i
fucking
love
tripels
ok
we
got
that
out
of
the
way
pours
a
magnificent
bright
orange
into
a
snifter
a
huge
offwhite
head
full
of
scattered
bubbles
fills
the
glass
to
the
rim
and
stays
there
for
a
while
before
slowly
fading
around
the
sides
first
which
leaves
a
hill
of
froth
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
before
it
eventually
fades
all
together
and
leaves
big
chunks
and
stringy
lacing
all
around
bold
aromas
of
sweet
bread
oranges
grapefruit
and
candy
rise
to
the
nose
tastes
spicy
and
melony
up
front
with
a
good
hit
of
alcohol
heat
immediate
following
i
like
it
a
lot
in
my
best
jim
carey
voice
other
various
fruits
some
malts
and
bold
helping
of
hop
bitternes
finish
things
off
medium
to
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
i
am
duly
impressed
and
am
going
to
stop
writing
now
so
i
can
concentrate
on
how
good
this
one
is
i
love
those
belgians
but
am
a
little
confused
with
this
one
first
of
all
this
is
an
amazing
looking
beer
a
nice
pale
orange
hazy
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
great
retention
and
that
belgian
lace
that
i
love
smell
i
didnt
much
care
for
although
there
was
some
yeast
sweet
fruits
and
bit
of
bread
i
thought
the
alochol
was
overpowering
this
i
didnt
not
expect
when
it
was
first
a
little
cooler
and
as
it
warmed
i
couldnt
get
away
from
the
alcohol
i
expected
it
to
be
present
but
i
thought
it
dominated
the
taste
was
pleasant
very
good
tripel
flavor
some
fruits
and
spices
that
sweet
candi
sugar
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
and
that
bite
of
alcohol
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
a
little
fuller
than
i
expected
but
still
pleasant
and
overall
it
was
a
good
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
bracing
and
wonderful
snappy
bitterness
all
along
surprising
and
standing
in
stark
contrast
to
the
overly
sweet
tripelstyle
brews
across
the
us
this
is
a
pleasingly
dry
brew
with
active
crisp
carbonation
complex
and
well
balanced
an
excellent
classic
tripel
d
highly
drinkable
especially
in
a
colder
environment
and
though
the
alcohol
is
deceptive
it
makes
for
a
nice
little
surprise
as
you
wrap
this
one
up
as
i
try
more
tripels
this
is
going
to
be
the
standard
i
judge
them
against
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
tripel
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
yet
definitely
recommend
this
one
overall
best
tripel
ive
had
in
my
limited
beer
career
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
aroma
is
esters
clove
banana
belgian
yeast
taste
follows
the
smell
but
is
more
intense
in
spiciness
finishes
with
a
lingering
alcohol
burn
crisp
massive
carbonation
medium
to
thick
body
great
spicy
brew
very
boozy
and
somewhat
expensive
will
limit
my
purchasing
this
beer
looks
and
smells
stunning
but
the
flavor
is
not
my
prefered
type
in
a
tripel
it
is
slightly
less
drinkable
than
pure
virgin
sweat
you
could
only
drink
a
few
bottles
before
it
loses
the
ability
to
make
you
feel
like
a
cancer
surgeon
who
just
cured
a
dying
chess
genius
of
cancer
in
his
brain
and
also
he
gets
better
at
chess
after
the
surgery
d
it
would
be
way
more
drinkable
if
the
alcohol
was
hidden
a
little
better
nice
sipper
with
some
soft
cheese
and
nuts
added
note
after
further
review
drinking
i
believe
my
hit
on
drinkability
is
unwarranted
this
is
the
best
in
the
style
so
there
fore
give
it
a
5
across
the
board
i
have
not
found
a
better
tripel
yet
d
did
not
like
this
one
at
all
cheers
pours
a
peach
orange
perhaps
i
could
call
it
grapefruit
color
moderate
head
that
tapers
off
pretty
quickly
about
a
quarter
of
the
way
through
just
a
patchy
head
remains
that
does
produce
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
pleasant
consisting
of
fruits
some
of
the
sweeter
ones
such
as
oranges
and
some
nice
yeast
semitangy
citrus
flavor
yeasty
and
extremely
easy
drinking
theres
almost
a
clean
watery
note
mixed
in
with
the
fruits
i
would
never
have
known
there
was
9
2
alcohol
in
there
if
i
didnt
look
at
the
bottle
quite
refreshing
too
but
if
youre
drinking
this
you
arent
looking
for
something
to
slug
down
while
sitting
in
the
sun
as
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
a
little
more
spicy
with
a
sour
grapefruit
flavor
and
a
banana
note
i
didnt
get
earlier
but
still
i
can
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
this
is
a
great
beer
but
it
didnt
wow
me
poured
into
a
westmalle
chalice
a
hazy
pineapple
color
somewhat
orange
in
the
middle
and
yellow
on
the
edges
not
much
in
the
way
of
foam
or
lacing
but
thats
probably
due
to
the
high
abv
very
sweet
boozy
aroma
hints
of
apple
and
spice
big
hits
of
candy
sugar
and
citrus
flavor
is
incredible
orange
juice
candied
citrus
fruits
slightly
grassy
and
floral
slight
acidic
wine
flavor
shows
up
as
it
warms
alcohol
is
wellhidden
on
the
tongue
but
a
warming
can
be
felt
on
the
way
down
nice
amount
of
carbonation
tingly
at
first
but
a
little
thick
on
the
tongue
as
it
flows
a
true
delight
and
a
true
sipper
to
be
consumed
in
small
adoring
amounts
perfect
tripel
a
very
very
good
beer
i
have
loved
it
for
years
and
forgot
about
my
little
pack
of
belgian
beers
stashed
away
some
more
crackers
to
come
easy
to
enjoy
overall
a
good
beer
but
too
sweet
to
be
anything
other
than
an
occasional
sipper
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
its
a
very
tasty
wellbalanced
tripel
would
recommend
to
anyone
with
appreciation
for
good
beer
im
just
about
finished
with
this
bottle
and
its
time
to
reflect
on
how
great
a
drinking
experience
i
just
enjoyed
its
a
hot
summer
day
and
im
sipping
on
a
brew
thats
9
5abv
and
i
find
it
so
damn
refreshing
go
figure
this
is
truly
a
world
class
brew
and
im
so
happy
i
got
a
chance
to
drink
this
again
after
many
years
doing
without
thanks
again
joe
d
a
pretty
good
tripel
overall
ok
drinkability
but
the
alcohol
seemed
a
bit
much
started
to
burn
my
mouth
and
throat
as
i
drank
more
of
it
i
am
not
sure
how
much
of
it
i
would
be
able
to
handle
but
if
a
tripel
is
your
style
this
is
a
fair
example
of
one
overall
great
this
is
what
belgians
are
all
about
complex
and
really
enjoyable
pours
a
deep
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
apples
pears
taste
is
an
excellent
blend
of
apples
pears
white
grape
and
some
other
miscellaneous
stuff
that
really
hit
the
mark
carbonation
was
just
right
and
i
could
have
sipped
this
stuff
all
night
in
short
a
wellcrafted
beautiful
tripel
enjoyable
for
different
reasons
at
different
ages
d
interesting
drink
but
with
fullness
and
9
abv
wont
drink
a
lot
not
in
a
bad
way
d
beautiful
belgian
tripel
sold
by
the
bottle
where
i
got
it
buy
more
than
one
if
you
are
in
the
same
situation
www
theviceblog
com
d
this
is
a
great
belgian
tripel
and
totally
defines
the
style
i
had
the
privilege
of
having
this
beer
close
to
the
source
last
summer
this
tasting
brings
back
those
memories
well
it
goes
extremely
well
with
spicy
marinated
grilled
shrimp
also
well
worth
it
and
deserves
its
reputation
hope
the
monks
keep
up
their
high
standards
super
super
super
but
you
probably
already
knew
that
the
reputation
of
this
beer
is
well
earned
i
loved
it
great
balance
between
the
9
5
and
the
drinkability
that
goes
along
with
a
great
tripel
plenty
of
the
fruity
esters
you
would
expect
from
it
i
detected
bananas
cloves
peaches
and
pepper
the
color
was
a
cloudy
gold
it
tasted
much
as
it
smelled
with
the
huge
head
you
would
expect
i
had
it
with
a
roasted
chicken
and
mashed
potatoes
and
it
went
perfectly
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
for
thanksgiving
overall
this
beer
defines
what
a
tripel
should
be
it
goes
down
so
smoothly
and
each
sip
is
more
enjoyable
than
the
previous
one
im
so
glad
to
have
10
of
these
left
d
the
alcohol
bite
and
the
intensity
of
the
taste
would
make
it
difficult
to
drink
this
in
quantity
but
im
going
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
beer
ive
got
in
front
of
me
for
sure
overall
westmalle
tripel
has
vaulted
itself
into
my
top
beers
i
had
sampled
another
trappist
ale
a
few
hours
before
this
one
and
i
thought
it
was
very
good
but
not
quite
great
this
one
is
truly
top
shelf
drinkability
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
while
and
i
forgot
how
incredible
it
was
holds
it
lofty
status
as
the
top
tripel
in
the
world
with
gleaming
results
it
is
the
best
tripel
around
accept
no
substitutes
i
wish
i
could
express
the
perfection
of
this
tripel
in
michael
jackson
beer
eloquence
but
words
cannot
do
this
enough
justice
not
supposed
to
talk
with
your
mouth
full
and
ive
got
12
a
glass
of
liquid
ambrosia
to
consume
so
ill
let
ratings
do
the
talking
poured
into
a
chalice
from
a
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
light
gold
forming
a
massive
fluffy
1
inch
white
head
that
slowly
fades
medium
lacing
remains
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
fruit
and
sugar
taste
begins
with
the
malts
followed
by
dark
fruit
flavors
and
candy
sugar
sweetness
and
ending
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
medium
bodied
beer
and
smooth
medium
finish
highly
drinkable
overall
nice
full
flavor
good
but
not
the
best
triple
that
ive
experienced
its
a
tripel
goes
down
smooth
the
high
level
of
carbonation
plays
the
flavors
off
the
tongue
in
a
very
sporadic
way
the
beer
is
simple
but
never
boring
doesnt
feel
9
5
until
you
are
most
of
the
way
through
the
bottle
great
drinkability
not
overwhelming
dwow
this
lives
up
to
its
rep
wish
i
had
about
4
more
of
these
for
tonight
as
this
has
the
it
quality
to
it
i
want
more
of
this
and
i
want
it
now
that
is
the
it
quality
unfortunately
this
is
the
only
bottle
i
have
but
i
can
rationalize
buying
a
few
more
of
these
despite
its
lofty
price
based
on
its
level
of
brilliance
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
plentiful
white
meringue
like
foam
aromas
are
signature
belgian
with
a
clean
phenolic
dominance
clove
citrus
bandaid
all
are
predominant
notes
with
some
sweet
alcohol
notes
to
round
out
on
the
palate
it
continues
to
be
a
very
clean
flavor
with
the
spiciness
really
coming
through
it
is
quite
dry
and
effervescent
giving
it
a
rather
thin
body
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
just
a
hint
in
the
finish
overall
i
can
understand
why
this
is
such
an
iconic
belgian
tripel
exemplary
of
the
style
in
its
finest
will
certainly
not
look
over
this
one
countless
times
in
the
beer
isle
again
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
tiny
bubbles
cascade
to
the
top
to
make
a
big
white
frothy
head
its
very
carbonated
and
makes
for
a
very
pretty
beer
theres
quite
a
bit
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
so
pour
with
caution
smells
yeastybready
and
of
some
malt
sweetness
tastes
extremely
dry
and
very
carbonated
lively
mouthfeel
creates
a
prickly
sensation
on
the
tongue
somewhat
champagneesque
but
not
fruity
at
all
it
drinks
very
dry
and
quaffable
the
yeast
character
is
kept
very
low
no
extreme
belgian
phenols
or
esthers
just
a
lively
golden
ale
and
its
done
very
well
good
but
im
finding
i
prefer
other
tripels
with
less
phenols
a
wonderful
ale
wish
i
lived
in
belgium
a
classic
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
westmalle
deserves
the
credit
that
has
been
bestowed
upon
it
by
delivering
the
uncommon
sensation
of
flavor
unity
im
impressed
more
by
the
westmalle
because
it
offers
nuances
that
can
only
be
found
in
a
true
belgian
triple
this
is
one
of
the
staples
of
beerdom
it
is
literally
a
part
of
history
and
in
my
humble
opinion
something
that
every
person
with
aspirations
of
being
a
beer
expert
should
learn
about
and
enjoy
very
carbonated
a
bit
prickly
on
the
tongue
and
cheeks
but
goes
down
fairly
smooth
the
mouthfeel
does
smooth
out
after
it
gets
to
room

crystal
clear
medium
straw
color
with
huge
white
head
had
to
stop
pouring
so
i
didnt
waste
any
nice
hoppy
citrusy
aroma
good
balance
actually
a
little
weaker
on
the
taste
than
i
expected
for
a
tripel
but
still
tasty
good
warming
due
to
the
high
abv
id
prefer
a
little
more
hops
than
malt
but
seemed
right
for
the
style
medium
carbonation
also
seemed
a
bit
weak
but
nothing
to
make
me
dislike
the
beer
all
in
all
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
12oz
bottle
purchased
from
lcbo
in
toronto
pours
a
nice
cloudy
light
gold
with
some
rougher
dark
floaties
nice
yeasty
aroma
the
first
taste
has
an
initial
yeastiness
that
quickly
moves
to
a
warming
mouthfeel
the
flavour
is
full
and
rich
the
alcohol
warmth
is
the
main
quality
to
this
one
along
with
some
associated
spiciness
a
great
drink
for
a
relaxing
evening
amazing
tripel
i
wont
rehash
all
the
technical
jargon
here
but
it
ranks
as
one
of
my
top
five
ive
ever
tried
just
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
a
treat
for
all
the
senses
nice
light
color
with
a
quick
to
form
reasonably
long
lasting
head
one
of
my
top
belgiums
for
sure
and
my
top
tripel
this
is
the
gold
standard
of
the
belgian
tripel
and
im
very
glad
i
got
to
experience
it
excellent
tripel
i
prefer
it
with
food
westmalles
tripel
is
the
boldest
tripel
ive
yet
to
have
its
bold
and
spicy
and
its
awesome
truely
a
world
class
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orangeish
color
with
alot
of
little
chunkies
in
the
bottom
tons
of
sediment
more
than
most
beers
ive
had
and
im
getting
up
there
with
the
number
ive
tried
smell
is
just
fantastic
very
aromatic
lots
of
fruity
flavors
in
the
nose
taste
is
very
very
good
has
a
small
alcohol
bite
it
is
a
bit
higher
9
5
so
thats
to
be
expected
belgians
are
just
soooo
good
i
havnet
found
one
that
hasnt
been
good
d
drinkability
is
quite
good
the
beer
goes
down
easy
for
me
all
the
flavors
are
what
i
look
for
in
a
good
tripel
a
great
brew
that
i
would
highly
recommend
notes
this
is
not
a
session
brew
but
you
knew
that
already
high
abv
must
be
respected
i
can
have
about
two
or
three
glasses
and
feel
fine
drinkability
cant
imagine
having
another
because
of
the
high
abv
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
suggests
it
pretty
mediumheavy
bodied
mouthfeel
kind
of
creamy
but
very
well
carbonated
which
makes
this
quite
drinkable
i
felt
like
doing
some
belgians
tonite
1st
on
deck
was
this
gem
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
w
a
1
thick
stiff
white
head
which
lasted
a
bit
leaving
plenty
of
lacing
in
my
snifter
a
fruity
cereal
grain
smell
pilsn
malts
and
a
hint
of
floral
noble
hop
aroma
some
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
as
well
a
crisp
tart
flavor
big
malts
up
front
w
an
alcoholic
applebanana
note
underneath
some
hops
present
as
well
finishes
a
bit
like
champagne
a
surprisingly
lightmed
mouthfeel
very
dry
drinks
like
a
6
5
abv
brew
good
amount
of
co2
an
awesome
beer
id
given
it
a
5
on
drinkability
but
im
afraid
i
be
sued
serving
type
bottle
d
very
light
body
and
goes
down
smooth
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
more
often
tasted
in
a
trio
of
tripel
with
chimay
white
and
fin
du
monde
pours
a
burnished
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
much
like
the
other
two
aroma
is
pleasantly
fruity
with
hints
of
apple
the
flavour
is
fantastic
the
fruits
again
but
not
nearly
as
prominent
as
fin
du
monde
this
time
paired
with
bready
malt
light
spicing
and
a
slightly
grainy
finish
which
seemed
to
be
the
characteristic
which
distinguished
itself
the
most
from
the
chimay
nice
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
excellent
drinkability
im
gonna
lay
me
a
few
of
these
down
d
extraordinarily
drinkable
abv
extremely
well
hidden
literally
could
drink
this
all
day
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
everything
here
seems
to
be
done
in
proportion
wow
what
a
beer
i
must
have
gotten
lucky
with
the
bottle
i
had
because
it
was
fresh
so
delicious
so
amazing
that
i
would
drink
this
every
day
if
i
could
it
poured
a
murky
gold
color
with
a
little
head
that
disappeared
quickly
oranges
lemons
grapefruits
honey
and
sage
were
all
present
in
my
wiffs
it
tasted
amazing
a
great
balance
of
all
of
the
above
with
little
sage
after
notes
its
a
refreshing
beer
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
for
a
big
guy
d
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
have
to
admit
that
it
is
not
my
favorite
trippel
still
this
is
a
world
class
beer
with
a
world
class
history
and
following
that
i
feel
is
mostly
deserved
d
tripels
are
always
very
drinkable
for
me
and
this
one
is
no
different
denser
than
some
with
its
chalky
and
powdery
mouthfeel
and
darker
color
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
flavor
stays
enjoyable
throughout
full
body
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
that
is
hindered
by
importation
much
better
fresh
i
almost
dont
buy
imported
beers
anymore
because
they
usually
have
rough
lives
this
is
near
a
5
0
in
belgium
d
at
9
abv
this
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
over
the
course
of
an
evening
that
would
give
you
time
to
enjoy
all
of
the
complexities
of
the
flavor
and
aromas
one
of
the
trappist
beers
this
poured
a
hazy
light
gold
with
thin
white
head
much
less
head
than
expected
it
smelled
sweet
and
unique
like
honey
yeast
and
cantaloupe
its
flavor
was
of
citrus
hops
bitterness
balanced
by
melon
and
yeast
it
was
watery
but
a
bit
sticky
with
strong
carbonation
and
a
mild
bitter
aftertaste
along
with
some
alcohol
warming
overall
this
was
a
unique
and
refined
beer
much
better
than
the
other
tripels
ive
had
unfortunately
i
only
bought
one
bottle
and
it
made
me
all
warm
and
fuzzy
inside
yes
i
want
more
i
may
not
sound
all
that
excited
in
this
review
about
westmalle
tripel
but
this
is
one
beer
thats
worthy
of
the
hype
without
question
a
highly
recommended
pick
by
me
and
one
beer
im
going
to
share
with
my
buddies
in
the
future
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
much
and
i
would
put
it
below
orval
chimay
and
some
other
trappists
that
i
have
enjoyed
im
giving
this
a
ton
of
points
though
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
a
really
well
made
beer
really
this
is
so
utterly
enjoyable
and
one
of
those
beers
all
beer
advocates
must
have
d
your
going
to
want
to
take
your
time
drinking
this
one
its
a
sipping
beer
d
definitely
a
sipper
d
a
delicious
tripel
that
is
very
refreshing
and
filling
this
is
an
excellent
trappist
beer
sip
and
enjoy
mouthfeel
was
refreshing
and
clean
almost
served
as
its
own
palate
cleanser
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
as
i
did
with
this
review
and
would
consider
this
to
be
a
4
daysweek
beverage
again
a
great
beer
but
i
liked
the
dubbel
better
in
the
glass
this
is
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
gold
with
a
one
to
two
finger
thick
head
that
falls
to
about
half
a
centimeter
of
tiny
pure
white
bubbles
the
smell
is
very
tart
lemon
citrus
with
a
touch
of
grass
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
yeasty
phenol
very
refreshing
the
taste
is
aggressively
peppery
and
tart
upfront
then
comes
a
subtle
rush
of
smooth
alcohol
and
finishes
with
a
fair
dose
of
hoppy
spice
and
bitterness
despite
the
somewhat
strong
flavor
profile
the
beer
remains
amazingly
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
fruity
yeasty
bitter
or
alcoholic
the
mouthfeel
is
light
from
the
carbonation
but
also
tingly
and
warming
from
the
alcohol
and
pepper
flavors
overall
the
pleasant
peppery
spice
will
linger
in
the
mouth
for
a
long
time
well
hidden
alcohol
in
an
incredibly
tasty
beer
make
this
a
real
treat
i
think
i
like
la
fin
du
monde
just
a
tiny
bit
more
than
this
beer
but
that
is
only
because
the
pepper
flavor
is
a
bit
less
harsh
in
that
one
but
that
said
they
are
both
simply
amazing
a
great
drink
for
a
good
meal
a
little
to
much
alcohol
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
highly
drinkable
d
im
speechless
this
beer
is
so
incredibly
delicious
it
is
so
complex
and
is
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
even
with
its
9
5
abv
it
goes
down
so
easily
i
could
definitely
put
down
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
which
for
a
trappist
is
quite
impressive
only
monks
could
brew
something
so
divine
i
really
cant
wait
until
i
drink
this
beer
again
in
conclusion
i
love
this
beer
i
will
have
this
again
and
again
and
probably
a
few
more
times
cheers
d
a
complex
beer
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
drinking
beer
the
standard
of
the
style
was
no
letdown
better
than
chimays
cinq
cents
imo
this
is
medium
bodied
mediumhigh
carbonation
very
smooth
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
another
very
good
trappist
beer
from
westmalle
second
time
around
still
a
wonder
to
me
lots
of
tangerine
on
the
palate
this
time
d
this
is
a
great
beer
i
had
to
take
off
a
little
bit
for
drinkability
because
the
high
abv
will
keep
me
from
enjoying
a
lot
of
this
beer
in
some
beers
the
alcohol
peeking
through
in
the
tastes
is
a
bad
thing
for
me
but
with
this
one
it
seems
to
complement
it
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
that
i
have
had
where
i
really
cant
think
of
anything
that
would
make
it
better
definitely
will
be
coming
back
to
this
one
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
smells
of
spices
a
bit
tart
and
flowery
the
first
taste
is
strong
with
a
bit
of
spice
a
good
taste
with
a
slight
sour
taste
as
a
finish
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
is
what
stands
out
fairly
drinkable
for
a
stronger
ale
overall
great
beer
appearance
is
almost
perfect
bright
golden
hue
with
a
creamy
frothy
head
smells
like
fresh
spiced
bananas
flavor
starts
out
very
sweet
with
the
peppery
esters
followed
with
a
hint
of
banana
sweetness
with
a
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
had
this
in
the
355
ml
and
the
750
ml
bottles
and
the
hop
bitterness
seems
more
pronounced
in
the
bigger
bottle
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
much
more
easydrinking

expected

this

a

should
be

it
will
spoil
you
if
its
one
of

so
expertly
brewed
you
will
appreciate
it
more
if
youve
gotten
some
time
in

more
beers
before
trying
it
trappist
ales
arent
so
highly
praised
for
nothing
as
ive
discovered
absolutely
sublime

ive
had
much
better

this
was
too
strong

overly

pretty

one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
tasted
for
sure
this
one
is
sure
to
please
and
satisfying
an
excellent
truetothestyle
belgian
brew
mouthfeel
was
superb
very
rich
and
thick
creamy
sweet
and
satisfying
esters
and
sugarfilled
candies
are
certainly
apparent
in
the
overall
complexion
of
this
brew
excellent
drinkability
despite
the
hefty
9
5
abv
goes
down
very
crisp
and
clean
without
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
one
of
the
better
belgians
out
there
definitely
recommended
poured
with
an
extremely
huge
creamy
white
head
yellow
in
color
with
what
looks
like
extreme
carbonation
slightly
hazy
aroma
was
not
great
lots
of
malt
and
yeast
broth
alcohol
and
orange
hops
were
the
highlights
flavor
was
good
ending
on
a
bitter
note
with
a
nice
warming
alcohol
sensation
goes
down
very
nicely
i
expected
more
from
this
date
on
bottle
is
26108
so
its
either
really
fresh
or
just
hitting
best
by
date
there
was
a
time
in
which
this
beer
was
a
top
100
beer
this
bottle
wouldnt
have
been
one
i
could
seriously
drink
this
all
night
a
debate
around
this
household
this
year
centers
on
the
superiority
of
either
this
bier
or
the
karmeliet
tripel
anyway
its
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
triples
itll
be
a
sad
sad
day
when
i
again
find
myself
in
a
situation
where
i
cant
enjoy
this
every
week
d
definitely
a
very
good
tripel
i
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
this
is
a
great
belgian
tripel
but
maybe
its
just
a
tad
past
its
prime
still
ill
definitely
pick
up
one
of
these
again
easily
my
favorite
trappist
and
an
absolute
favorite
in
the
abbey
style
tripel
catagory
if
it
wasnt
so
cost
prohibitive
i
would
enjoy
it
much
more
often
classic
overall
an
average
triple
this
is
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
still
worth
a
try
dthis
brews
nose
was
exceptional
and
like
its
trappiste
cousins
it
was
highly
drinkable
a
voyage
of
the
senses
and
a
pleasure
to
imbibe
d
if
someone
wants
to
buy
me
westmalle
at
my
favorite
beer
bar
ill
drink
them
until
i
can
drink
no
more
a
classic
i
have
to
admit
that
westmalle
is
usually
the
trappist
that
i
pass
on
most
often
after
tasting
the
dubbel
the
other
night
though
and
being
thoroughly
intrigued
i
decided
it
was
time
to
give
the
tripel
another
go
poured
in
to
my
westmalle
chalice
thanks
julios
an
inviting
slightly
dark
golden
color
heading
was
awesome
big
white
and
fluffy
with
many
tiny
air
bubbles
racing
toward
the
head
aroma
is
surprisingly
clean
almost
pilsner
like
in
its
dryness
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
fruit
or
spice
from
the
smell
taste
starts
off
with
a
big
splash
of
hop
bitterness
with
traces
of
pineapple
pear
and
pepper
in
the
back
it
leaves
the
palate
slightly
numb
after
swallowing
body
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
high
having
said
that
though
this
beer
is
incredibly
complex
so
i
would
advise
drinkers
to
take
their
time
with
this
one
i
still
cant
say
that
tripel
is
a
style
that
i
am
overly
fond
of
but
this
stuff
deserves
respect
like
i
said
before
complex
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
gorgeous
straw
yelloworange
with
a
huge
white
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
while
aromas
of
spices
are
the
lead
with
honey
and
grapes
close
behind
outstanding
carbonation
the
honey
flavors
are
definitely
present
tons
of
spices
in
this
as
well
tastes
like
fall
with
its
hints
of
apples
and
pears
and
spices
warms
the
mouth
with
its
complex
flavors
as
with
all
trappists
try
it
this
beer
is
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
complex
as
hellespecially
with
a
couple
months
in
the
cellar
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
abv
simply
exceptional

cloudy
orange
with
a
3
cm
foamy
off
white
head
that
is
mostly
lasting
aroma
of
bread
fruit
and
spices
flavor
is
initially
sweet
and
fruity
mostly
pear
and
apples
aftertaste
is
a
hint
of
spice
bananas
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
medium
bodied
noted
carbonation
great
lacing
and
nice
level
of
alcohol
more
drinkable
than
the
dubbel
and
worth
a
try
a
top
trappist
pick
d
the
most
drinkable
belgian
ever
experienced
among
my
top
beers
of
all
time
this
is
a
great
beer
one
to
be
savored
because
it
is
complex
and
also
expensive
a
good
special
occasion
beer
d
not
an
incredible
tripel
but
very
drinkable
and
tasty
d
it
is
a
bit
filling
to
serve
as
a
session
beer
but
i
could
enjoy
it
well
into
the
night
my
nose
enjoyed
the
lemonorange
fruitiness
the
hint
of
berries
and
the
yeasty
back
beat
but
i
was
completely
won
over
upon
tasting
the
steady
but
patient
malt
flavor
that
periodically
percolated
in
the
palate
accompanying
the
rest
of
the
assemblage
idyllically
carbonated
to
channel
the
durable
hopped
flavor
this
is
really
one
of
the
best
belgians
ive
ever
had
imbibing
this
was
a
privilege
pours
cloudy
light
orange
cloudy
opaque
head
at
first
look
the
body
seems
heavy
due
to
the
yeast
but
the
taste
is
surprisingly
light
good
fruity
flavor
good
dry
yeast
aftertaste
the
abv
is
a
slight
kick
in
the
head
but
still
one
of
the
more
sophisticated
and
complex
trappists
ive
had
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
not
mind
picking
up
a
few
others
i
am
kinda
curious
to
try
the
dubbel
as
well
since
the
westmalle
brewery
definitely
left
a
good
impression
on
me
a
bit
of
a
sipper
beer
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
so
not
one
you
could
drink
too
many
off
at
one
time
definitely
a
big
beer
and
one
that
challenges
you
at
first
especially
given
the
alcohol
content
and
taste
one
of
the
most
fragrant
beers
i
have
ever
set
my
nose
upon
prosit
mk
mouthfeel
is
modest
its
a
drinkable
brew
but
basically
a
one
and
done
in
my
opinion
too
expensive
and
unremarkable
to
be
a
session
brew
pours
cloudy
gold
with
a
monstrous
head
that
lingers
for
a
very
long
time
lacing
quite
present
the
nose
is
extremely
sweet
with
strong
citric
tones
even
and
smooth
on
the
mouth
with
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
a
bitter
edge
that
follows
on
the
trail
end
mouthfeel
is
typical
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
a
sitting
if
you
could
tolerate
the
9
5
alcohol
this
is
a
great
brew
whose
best
feature
and
contribution
to
beer
world
is
that
it
is
so
readily
available
and
has
probably
helped
enlighten
a
lot
of
people
as
to
what
the
possibilities
for
beer
are
i
have
nothing
to
really
criticize
this
brew
other
than
i
think
i
prefer
slightly
bigger
boned
triples
and
the
price
can
be
prohibitive
gets
a
little
boozy
as
it
warms
up
d
went
fantastic
with
turkey
and
stuffing
think
the
alcohol
has
mellowed
with
the
12
months
of
aging
in
a
darkend
garage
producing
a
crispy
apple
flavour
i
dont
remember
this
was
great
d
kinda
dull
but
drinkable
you
could
knock
them
back
and
get
plastered
im
not
that
impressed
a
wonderful
beer
a
lightly
amber
colored
beer
with
a
beautiful
rocky
two
finger
head
that
barely
fades
to
a
thick
laceing
and
never
dies
down
the
smell
is
slightly
fruity
and
mostly
phenolic
the
taste
is
lightly
of
fruits
and
dominately
spicey
with
a
crisp
dry
almosy
bitter
not
really
hop
bitter
though
finish
the
body
almost
seems
light
but
i
guess
is
medium
dry
and
sharply
carbonated
this
beer
is
bitter
almost
sour
so
much
so
that
the
only
real
other
pronouced
flavors
are
the
spicey
phenolic
tastes
from
the
reknowned
trappists
yeasts
those
qualities
make
this
beer
incredibly
intricate
and
an
excellent
drink
yum
real
good
beer
tastes
of
spices
yeasty
alcohol
floral
hops
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
and
sugars
a
great
triple
drinkability
a
classic
belgian
ale
that
deserves
a
chance
to
be
in
any
fans
catalog
i
am
debating
which
is
the
better
beer
to
reach
for
westmalle
dubbel
or
the
tripel
i
think
if
session
is
the
objective
the
dubbel
is
the
better
bet
i
could
drink
the
tripel
again
after
having
one
but
at
9
it
is
a
dangerous
session
beer
4
5
drinkability
lovely
and
rich
this
is
not
something
to
have
daily
but
rather
one
to
have
on
rare
occasion
when
you
have
the
time
and
peace
to
savor
it
properly
its
a
light
a
summery
sort
of
beer
but
the
alcohol
will
warm
you
on
cold
nights
just
fine
belgian
ales
are
my
favorite
tripels
most
of
all
westmalle
certainly
lives
up
to
the
trappist
tradition
overall
an
excellent
tripel
with
very
few
faults
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
bottle
with
a
tall
soft
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
sour
at
first
but
soon
turns
to
a
milder
duvellike
aroma
of
creamy
pale
malts
the
flavor
is
sweeter
and
maltier
than
the
other
big
trappist
tripel
chimay
white
theres
a
bit
of
farmhouse
funk
in
the
malt
and
drop
of
candy
and
caramel
it
finishes
with
an
obscured
hops
flavor
thats
grapefruity
but
buried
under
the
malt
overall
i
dont
think
the
flavor
is
that
amazing
yes
it
is
quite
nice
but
not
my
favorite
tripel
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
but
a
hint
of
alcohol
detracts
from
it
d
one
of
the
best
there
is
in
the
style
a
nice
choice
to
wind
out
after
a
long
stressful
day
not
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
though
very
enjoyable
beer
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
nose
is
very
pleasant
as
it
improves
as
the
beer
warms
hints
of
sweet
fruits
including
pear
and
apple
are
prevelant
with
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
of
pears
apples
finishing
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
moutfeel
is
pure
belgian
bliss
extremely
smooth
when
it
first
hits
the
palate
lingering
hop
bitmerness
remains
afterwards
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
and
certainly
worth
a
try
for
trippel
fans
pale
golden
with
some
yeast
haze
and
a
classic
belgian
head
which
just
wont
quit
first
impression
on
the
nose
is
pepper
followed
by
malts
and
fruits
which
are
different
on
every
sniff
complex
peppery
malt
flavours
are
followed
by
some
warm
alcoholic
notes
the
bitterness
is
crisp
and
leaves
a
dry
finish
yet
with
a
full
mouthfeel
yum
pours
a
hazy
light
copper
with
a
frothy
longlasting
2
finger
head
only
small
chunks
of
lacing
clung
to
the
glass
for
a
short
period
of
time
nice
fruity
aroma
with
some
breadyyeasty
notes
and
a
slight
alcohol
detection
flavors
are
full
and
rounded
balancing
well
fruity
esters
and
a
nice
bready
maltiness
to
balance
some
citrus
maybe
oranges
or
tangerines
slightly
tart
making
the
back
of
my
mouth
tingle
hints
of
alcohol
also
in
the
flavor
hop
bitterness
also
comes
through
but
in
a
pleasant
fashion
mouthfeel
is
medium
viscocity
tongue
coating
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
this
is
an
excellent
sipping
beer
with
the
flavors
melding
and
blending
so
much
better
as
it
warms
a
definite
musttry
for
any
belgian
fan
good

edited
to
say
watch
out
for
the
hangover
on
this
one
pretty
harsh
d
the
dryness
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
but
this
beer
is
better
to
enjoy
with
the
nose
than
the
palate
had
the
flavor
matched
the
aroma
it
would
have
been
a
firstrate
tripel
still
an
excellent
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
if
not
a
trip
to
belgium
this
beer
is
how
i
enjoy
tripels
perfect
balance
and
a
good
handle
of
the
sweetnees
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
white
head
that
crackles
and
fizzes
like
its
really
alive
not
too
much
lacing
and
not
too
great
a
retention
but
these
are
not
qualities
that
really
matter
to
me
in
a
beer
i
smell
musty
earthy
hops
some
mildly
sweet
pale
malt
and
spicy
yeastiness
clove
pepper
and
cardamom
to
name
a
few
alcohol
taste
is
boozier
than
most
other
tripels
ive
tried
but
i
love
it
i
taste
everything
that
i
smell
and
also
detect
a
hint
of
pineapple
call
me
crazy
thats
what
this
one
gives
me
medium
mouthfeel
tastes
lighter
than
it
is
because
of
the
carbonation
i
would
drink
this
all
day
if
i
could
this
booziness
destroyed
the
drinkability
for
me
if
i
want
a
boilermaker
ill
order
one
also
drinking
just
one
330
ml
bottle
gave
me
heartburn
and
a
slight
hangover
which
never
happens
to
me
when
drinking
a
similar
size
bottle
of
other
9
brews
appearance
is
a
pale
straw
color
with
three
fingers
of
frothy
white
head
on
top
very
limited
lacing
opaque
beer
a
good
bit
of
yeast
floating
around
nose
is
really
strong
citrus
lemon
specifically
lots
of
really
sweet
malt
and
some
spiciness
flavor
is
really
good
in
no
particular
order
spices
warming
alcohol
citrus
a
touch
of
orange
as
the
beer
warms
nothing
to
complain
about
here
body
is
really
good
sharp
carbonation
thats
spicy
and
refreshing
on
the
tongue
medium
to
full
body
i
really
liked
this
one
a
tasty
refreshing
tripel
not
weighty
like
some
actually
a
bit
like
a
saison
overall
definitely
recommended
d
absolutely
one
of
the
top
5
beers
i
have
ever
tried
and
i
have
tried
a
lot
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
everyone
i
know
and
will
be
picking
up
more
tomorrow
i
bought
25
or
so
singles
to
give
them
a
whirl
and
this
is
my
third
on
and
the
best
so
far
pours
with
a
bit
of
cloudiness
and
suspended
yeast
particles
with
a
glorious
slightly
tarnished
gold
color
and
perfectly
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aroma
of
honey
and
bananas
along
with
spicy
continental
hops
and
raw
alcohol
perfect
for
the
style
on
the
palate
incomparably
smooth
with
great
complexity
things
start
out
with
juicy
bananas
and
sweet
malts
then
switch
over
to
increased
hop
bitterness
and
a
finish
thats
almost
entirely
dry
mouthfeel
is
rich
with
medium
thickness
at
the
beginning
then
things
thin
out
a
bit
and
introduce
a
bit
of
alcoholic
burn
this
is
a
classic
beer
the
best
tripel
ive
come
across
outstanding
edit
ive
had
westmalle
tripel
several
times
since
the
above
review
which
was
my
first
time
drinking
it
for
reasons
unknown
it
has
never
impressed
me
nearly
as
much
since
still
undoubtedly
an
excellent
beer
though
i
have
marked
down
drinkability
to
a
3
5
altering
the
overall
score
to
4
4
an
excellent
tripel
one
of
my
favorite
styles
up
there
with
the
best
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
sample
so
far
unique
and
very
enjoyable
d
very
nice
combination
of
sweetness
carbonation
and
alchol
an
great
tripel
an
absolutely
stunning
tripel
always
a
classic
better
every
time
i
revisit
it
this
beer
has
all
the
complexity
and
firm
dryness
that
are
so
often
lost
on
imitators
it
is
spicy
and
vibrant
a
perfect
pairing
for
fatty
foods
that
need
something
to
cut
through
the
flavor
and
refresh
the
palate
then
again
it
is
great
all
by
itself
mouthfeel
is
not
quite
creamy
but
smooth
a
little
too
spicy
to
become
drinkable
but
i
would
argue
the
style
warrants
less
drinkability
i
do
enjoy
some
more
candy
sugar
prescense
in
my
tripels
but
this
is
a
unique
and
interesting
alternative
dated
060208
i
wonder
how
old
that
makes
this
beer
hazy
bright
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
huge
white
clump
of
a
head
the
smell
is
good
but
subtle
yeasty
and
spicy
the
taste
is
smooth
spicy
delicious
but
not
at
all
strong
or
sweet
like
many
american
tripels
i
have
had
the
fact
that
this
is

abv
and
i
cant
taste
it
is
impressive
this
may
be
the
best
tripel
ive
had
so
far
more
subtle
than
american
tripels
taste
in
a
word
fantastic
a
creamy
mouthfeel
exposes
light
citrus
all
over
orange
is
big
here
with
a
strangely
pleasant
lemon
aftertaste
not
sour
spiciness
abounds
with
hints
of
coriander
which
may
explain
the
soapy
aroma
this
is
a
great
tripel
that
i
would
buy
again
and
again
if
it
werent
so
expensive
still
a
bit
raw
very
very
dry
well
worth
a
try
but
a
sipper
for
certain
taste
is
subtly
sweet
with
some
pale
bready
malts
and
yeast
again
some
spices
and
then
citrus
flavor
along
with
a
grassy
and
bitter
dose
of
hops
in
the
finish
it
finishes
very
dry
with
some
bitterness
but
is
very
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
overcarbonated
and
the
spritzy
nature
of
it
detracts
a
bit
from
the
smoothness
of
the
taste
its
quite
drinkable
though
and
obviously
a
very
good
tripel
drinkability
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
scores
a
90
on
this
site
this
beer
was
great
id
love
to
try
it
aged
the
beer
poured
a
murky
gold
colour
into
a
chalice
glass
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
was
very
yeasty
with
some
malt
and
cloves
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
slightly
champagne
in
nature
the
flavour
was
that
of
yeast
malt
and
cloves
with
a
dry
finish
drinkability
easy
to
drink
delicious
great
example
of
a
tripel
d
dangerously
drinkable
no
indication
of
the
power
it
packs
until
i
stood
up
afterward
a
very
enjoyable
beer
d
tasty
but
too
strong
to
be
repeatedly
drinkable
my
4th
trappist
experience
has
proven
to
be
the
best
yet
and
im
fully
convinced
that
westmalle
tripel
is
the
tripel
to
end
all
tripels
drinkability
is
alright
this
brew
has
a
high
alcohol
presence
a
strong
bite
from
the
carbonation
and
will
leave
a
novice
beer
drinker
with
a
buzz
all
in
all
the
brew
is
well
balanced
it
just
overdoes
the
bite
cheers
drinkability
this
one
is
recommended
ive
had
some
tripels
that
i
didnt
like
at
all
but
this
one
is
quite
good
i
couldnt
see
anyone
pounding
45
of
these
but
this
is
a
good
rich
example
for
sipping
while
i
quite
enjoyed
this
tripel
i
felt
that
it
lacked
much
in
the
aroma
department
and
merely
came
across
as
an
okay
example
drinkability
is
good
the
carbonation
level
is
just
a
touch
high
for
my
liking
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
quite
enjoyable
a
good
representation
of
the
style
one
more
example
of
a
fine
genuine
trappist
ale
once
again
believe
the
hype
well
worth
the
2
99
sale
price
cant
wait
to
try
the
dubbel
drinkability
is
very
high
the
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
this
is
quenching
and
tasty
a
master
work
of
brewing
d
the
carbonation
helps
the
drinkability
but
i
have
a
hard
time
wanting
more
than
one
of
these
much
spicer
and
less
fruity
than
other
beers
of
a
similar
style
and
it
is
very
medicinal
which
i
cant
say
i
enjoy
a
marvelous
tripel
certainly
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
anyone
could
ever
try
im
not
sure
which
i
prefer
aged
or
fresh
it
has
held
up
well
perhaps
improved
perhaps
not
either
way
this
is
still
something
incredibly
fantastic
and
i
have
savoured
every
single
drop
i
will
always
savour
every
drop
a
wonderful
beer
d
great
9
5
be
damned
this
is
a
session
beer
a
really
short
session
im
not
a
huge
tripel
fan
but
i
do
enjoy
them
considering
the
ratings
of
this
one
i
was
disappointed
last
bottle
i
reviewed
was
bad
i
believe
from
improper
storage
this
is
certainly
a
very
tasty
brew
worthy
of
its
trappist
designation
a
bit
hoppier
than
other
tripels
but
that
adds
to
its
character
effervescent
and
full
in
the
mouth
peppery
nose
and
ripe
fruit
taste
make
this
a
lovely
experience
apparently
this
is
what
a
tripel
is
supposed
to
be
but
its
not
my
favorite
not
that
its
bad
it
is
very
nice
and
very
very
easy
to
put
back
something
everyone
should
try
and
try
again
good
but
would
probably
benefit
from
some
aging
abv
a
bit
too
hot
at
this
point
imho
d
excellent
considering
the
strength
you
could
really
get
into
trouble
with
this
one
all
around
a
terrific
beer
archetypal
tripel
generally
easy
to
find
a
must
have
in
any
case
alcohol
presence
felt
immediately
on
the
palate
but
fades
very
quickly
soft
mouthfeel
that
is
very
pleasant
almost
metallic
aftertaste
this
is
not
a
session
beer
obviously
but
a
nice
after
dinner
tipple
respect
for
the
westmalle
tripel
though
i
may
prefer
the
chimay
blanche
maybe
d
very
good
belgian
with
complex
flavors
with
well
hidden
alcohol
i
hate
to
give
a
beer
especially
a
trappist
a
bad
review
but
this
beer
was
not
very
good
at
all
i
had
a
few
sips
and
then
poured
the
rest
of
the
750
down
the
drain
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
batch
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
bitter
and
sour
and
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
tripel
i
have
seen
this
beer
available
at
tons
of
stores
nowadays
i
really
enjoy
the
sweeter
tripels
like
this
superb
while
far
from
terrible
i
really
dont
like
the
flavor
balance
of
this
beer
which
leans
too
far
towards
alcohol
might
be
my
least
favorite
triple
of
the
trappist
and
major
abbey
brands
has
always
seemed
overrated
to
me
overall
a
decent
brew
this
one
would
work
with
a
plate
of
lamb
kabobs
a
solid
beer
that
pales
when
compared
to
others
in
the
style
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
but
look
for
others
to
rule
the
style
another
chance
to
taste
a
true
trappist
beer
great
pour
it
comes
out
a
straw
and
cloudy
gold
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
good
head
make
this
a
perfect
looking
beer
aroma
is
peaches
pears
and
tangerines
with
a
nice
hint
of
whiskey
in
the
background
taste
is
citrusy
with
some
berry
in
there
a
nottoosweet
taste
with
a
nice
bitter
dry
aftertaste
and
a
warming
alcohol
sensation
as
it
goes
down
not
my
favorite
trappist
brew
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
from
my
notes
52807
pours
a
onefinger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
pale
amber
color
slight
malty
nose
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor
is
balanced
to
slightly
sour
finish
has
some
alcohol
and
sourness
not
nearly
as
good
as
bottle
ontap
at
summertime
restaurant
scheveningen
nl
5
6
85
for
a
330ml
glass
the
flavor
doesnt
stand
as
well
on
its
own
as
i
had
hoped
its
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
for
a
tripel
and
requires
the
help
of
some
gouda
cheese
to
tease
out
the
true
nuances
of
its
taste
some
sweet
vanilla
notes
pair
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
hop
the
9
5
is
masked
well
at
first
but
a
dominating
alcohol
note
warms
through
eventually
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
carbonated
with
a
light
body
and
a
nice
alcoholic
bite
to
the
aftertaste
very
drinkable
surprisingly
so
for
a
tripel
theres
enough
complexity
to
go
around
but
the
flavor
was
just
a
bit
off
the
mark
very
nice
overall
im
glad
i
pulled
this
bottle
when
i
did
i
dont
have
much
experience
cellaring
westmalle
as
i
try
to
only
cellar
750ml
bottles
of
belgians
whenever
possible
and
750s
of
westmalle
are
hard
to
come
by
in
my
parts
but
the
complexity
of
this
one
really
came
through
i
have
never
tasted
such
a
strong
oakvanilla
flavor
in
this
beer
before
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
the
other
bottle
i
have
tastes
after
another
year
d
the
drinkabilty
is
out
of
this
world
for
such
a
potent
beer
as
of
right
now
this
is
my
second
favorite
tripel
only
behind
de
garres
house
tripel
obviously
this
is
not
a
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
chugged
but
savored
seems
like
this
would
be
a
great
after
dinner
beer
very
drinkable
cant
say
if
the
switch
from
cork
has
changed
this
brew
but
as
such
my
favorite
is
still
tripel
karmeliet
overall
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
a
trappist
brew
i
loved
it
along
with
every
other
trappist
brew
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
reminds
me
of
the
chimay
tripple
and
an
orval
a
bit
only
a
noob
wouldnt
enjoy
such
a
high
quality
brew
d
very
good
on
the
drinkability
scale
its
smooth
flavorful
and
wellbalanced
the
alcohol
will
get
you
in
the
end
though
a
flatout
outstanding
beer
a
great
representation
of
the
wonderful
tripel
style
im
quite
fond
of
tripels
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
a
nice
beer
but
i
wouldnt
hunt
it
down
again
in
a
hurry
ive
had
better
tripels
powerful
but
drinkable
well
sippable
after
finishing
the
small
bottle
i
was
looking
for
more
though
it
was
enough
for
a
wonderful
nightcap
one
of
belgiums
great
contributions
to
mankind
there
are
two
quick
personal
stories
i
think
i
need
to
relate
regarding
this
beer
the
first
is
that
when
i
bought
this
beer
i
was
afraid
it
may
be
past
its
prime
and
questioned
the
date
on
the
bottle
httpbeeradvocate
comforumread903581
because
the
same
store
might
occasionally
try
to
sell
a
lessthanfresh
bottle
to
you
by
placing
a
red
clearance
price
tag
on
it
some
fellow
bas
at
the
time
helped
me
realize
that
the
date
was
best
before
51808
and
that
the
beer
would
be
fine
and
i
thank
them
for
that
the
second
story
which
happened
before
story
1
is
that
two
people
whose
opinions
of
beer
i
deeply
respect
tried
this
beer
at
the
same
exact
time
with
their
backs
turned
to
each
other
so
each
wouldnt
see
the
reaction
of
the
other
when
they
turned
around
both
of
them
had
shocked
looks
on
their
faces
and
were
amazed
at
how
great
the
beer
tasted
while
i
may
not
like
the
beer
as
much
as
they
did
i
can
certainly
see
why
they
were
so
amazed
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
the
750
might
be
a
bit
much
for
one
person
though
given
its
thickness
alcohol
and
sweetness
this
beer
is
very
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
recommend
that
you
try
it
i
could
easily
go
through
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
it
is
really
a
matter
of
if
i
could
afford
to
do
it
at
nearly
5
dollars
a
bottle
worth
every
single
penny
if
you
like
tripels
and
havent
had
a
westmalle
i
would
argue
that
youve
never
really
had
a
tripel
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
very
good
beer
this
has
been
sitting
in
my
beer
frig
waiting
for
me
to
drink
it
and
i
cant
believe
i
waited
as
long
as
i
did
this
is
a
great
beer
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
d
this
is
a
beer
to
savor
it
does
down
very
smooth
with
a
nice
aftertaste
i
will
most
certainly
have
this
fantastic
tripel
again
d
delicious
not
too
sweet
like
some
belgians
and
the
alcohol
isnt
overly
prominent
the
abv
is
pretty
high
its
a
good
afterdinner
sipper
or
nightcap
dthis
is
the
quitissenttial
tripel
very
good
a
bottle
i
picked
up
from
a
display
at
consumer
beverage
in
hales
corners
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
yellow
with
lots
of
soft
secondaryfermentation
produced
head
smells
tripelish
with
some
clove
notes
and
lots
of
coriander
flavor
is
a
bit
like
a
white
wine
up
front
with
some
spiciness
on
the
back
end
not
as
fullflavored
as
other
tripels
ive
enjoyed
like
tripel
karmeliet
allagash
and
victory
golden
monkey
mouthfeel
is
quite
soft
but
a
bit
thin
upfront
pretty
drinkable
now
i
wouldnt
rate
this
above
a
2
5
for
drinkability
a
year
ago
due
to
overwhelming
alcohol
a
tripel
that
is
very
good
would
be
my
description
of
this
beer
my
problem
was
i
was
expecting
a
truly
great
beer
that
could
be
considered
a
benchmark
maybe
mines
a
fluke
i
dont
know
but
ill
be
hitting
other
tripels
before
i
come
back
to
this
one
pretty
drinkable
for
a
tripel
but
still
at
9
i
can
only
take
one
or
two
at
a
time
its
lightbodied
and
very
easy
to
sip
however
a
slight
creaminess
to
it
as
well
the
carbonation
doesnt
attack
like
id
think
from
the
bubbles
but
is
definitely
noted
westmalle
was
the
first
tripel
at
least
by
the
trappists
drie
lindins
witkap
pater
is
probably
the
originator
and
is
the
benchmark
of
the
style
for
a
reason
this
a
fantastic
beer
it
has
a
very
romantic
old
world
history
yet
its
execution
is
clearly
indicative
of
their
modern
brewery
and
scientific
approach
its
just
too
difficult
for
me
to
try
to
discern
favorite
beer
but
westmalles
tripel
is
certainly
high
on
my
list
if
you
have
a
chance
to
get
this
do
so
take
your
time
and
savor
all
that
it
has
to
offer
and
of
course
dont
serve
it
too
cold
i
generally
prefer
maltier
less
dryless
hoppy
abbey
ales
but
this
one
is
something
to
be
enjoyed
poured
in
a
brandy
snifter
to
prevent
the
head
from
overflowing
any
other
type
of
glass
thick
foamy
inch
head
with
tons
of
bubbling
carbonation
head
became
thicker
like
vanilla
ice
cream
as
it
reduced
leaving
very
thick
lacing
exceptional
color
and
head
beautiful
apple
ciderlike
color
with
a
slight
haze
yeast
aroma
with
a
sweet
malt
note
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
and
is
the
only
thing
preventing
me
from
giving
this
tripel
all
5s
absolutely
superb
mouthfeel
in
every
respect
it
is
a
bit
more
bitter
than
most
tripels
ive
tried
but
i
like
it
slight
phenolic
taste
on
the
finish
creamy
with
a
rolling
texture
due
to
high
abv
i
cannot
give
it
a
5
for
drinkability
although
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
it
is
definately
there
and
makes
me
wonder
how
i
am
going
to
finish
this
whole
750ml
bottle
by
myself
but
im
sure
ill
manage
bitterness
is
most
distinguishable
towards
the
end
of
your
glass
a
touch
of
spice
and
vanilla
adds
to
the
medium
body
overall
absolutely
exceptional
id
bring
a
bottle
of
this
to
a
nice
dinner
over
a
bottle
of
wine
anyday
try
it
overall
in
many
respects
this
is
the
ultimate
tripel
the
one
against
which
to
measure
all
others
in
the
style
yet
the
nose
is
surprisingly
restrained
even
to
the
point
of
being
nearly
absent
and
this
is
both
a
surprise
and
a
disappointment
this
is
an
excellent
world
class
beer
but
it
is
not
perfect
i
wonder
if
the
bottle
has
been
improperly
aged
or
stored
before
i
purchased
it
dangerously
quaffable
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
full
bodied
the
carbonation
is
perfect
the
beer
drinks
very
smooth
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
tripel
i
will
have
this
beer
again
appearance
is
a
cloudy
blonde
with
vigorous
carbonation
and
a
thick
white
foamy
head
smell
is
of
the
typical
champagnelike
yeasty
aroma
associated
with
many
belgian
ales
out
there
mild
and
sweet
taste
is
sweet
with
a
definite
citrus
flavor
that
unlike
other
reviewers
i
wasnt
able
to
detect
in
this
beers
aroma
taste
was
good
but
not
as
flavorful
as
i
had
anticipated
still
a
very
good
beer
however
mouthfeel
is
warming
and
alcoholic
with
crisp
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
brew
that
is
easily
drinkable
served
a
hazy
straw
colored
yellow
with
a
decent
sized
frothy
head
that
was
rather
slow
to
diminish
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
citrus
with
some
peppery
spice
there
was
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
sweet
malt
with
a
good
yeast
bite
that
combines
nicely
with
the
hop
bitterness
there
was
a
creamy
feel
to
the
beer
with
decent
carbonation
this
beer
was
just
about
perfect
taste
is
very
strong
you
can
definitely
taste
the
booze
and
its
somewhat
harsh
but
somehow
balanced
well
by
the
sweet
lemonpepper
malt
and
bouquet
of
aromatic
fruits
and
flowers
that
smell
of
roses
and
light
whitechocolate
cherries
very
spicey
too
with
some
caramel
and
apple
acetaldehyde
that
could
use
some
conditioning
all
in
all
very
pleasant
brew
if
i
had
a
good
cellar
ide
let
it
mature
for
a
year
because
it
would
be
a
real
treat
yellow
gold
with
a
rocky
creamy
foam
that
laces
the
glass
as
it
dissipates
this
brew
smells
leathery
and
spicy
perhaps
this
is
the
quintessential
belgian
smell
there
is
a
strong
sweetness
to
the
taste
but
the
it
is
cut
by
the
carbonation
which
lightens
the
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
just
noticeable
to
taste
and
smell
but
it
sneaks
up
on
you
as
you
drain
the
glass
another
superb
trappist
ale
this
one
a
triple
complex
in
flavor
and
aroma
with
a
fanstastic
presentation
highly
recommended
i
didnt
really
get
to
the
sophistication
of
this
brew
in
2007
my
palate
has
learned
around
the
hops
and
spice
is
a
complex
malt
and
yeast
profile
i
think
i
might
have
sensed
this
without
the
capacity
to
articulate
it
as
a
scored
flavor
a
4
5
to
begin
with
a
touch
of
cork
but
an
artificial
cork
and
vinosity
honey
and
apricots
i
should
say
too
that
the
bitterness
is
certainly
not
passive
but
not
particularly
strong
either
pepper
but
no
lemon
which
i
might
have
expected
also
i
do
not
think
the
aroma
is
as
interesting
as
it
ought
to
be
whats
wrong
with
a
normative
review
semi
transparent
value
of
coppergold
in
color
very
tick
head
of
off
white
and
not
lacy
good
triple
blend
of
yeast
candy
and
bitter
citrus
like
the
triple
alcohol
is
apparent
so
let
it
warm
a
bit
before
tasting
if
you
like
triples
this
belgian
will
present
itself
will
a
an
interesting
blend
with
added
spice
and
fruit
in
the
background
a
very
nice
tripel
deserving
the
recognition
it
receives
easily
consumed
the
bottle
and
could
drink
more
although
the
abv
would
soon
slow
me
down
kind
of
pricey
at
5
6
for
the
bottle
but
still
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
little
bit
disappointed
the
appearance
is
great
and
the
smell
is
pretty
good
the
taste
however
i
found
unpleasantly
bitter
not
a
hop
bitterness
but
an
unripe
fruit
finish
maybe
this
would
benefit
from
some
aging
something
i
will
definitely
revisit
i
dont
know
how
drinkable
it
is
given
the
high
abv
and
strong
complexity
but
i
would
definitely
return
to
this
pick
one
up
if
you
havent
already
different
and
easy
to
drink
verdict
less
inyourface
than
many
of
its
brethren
but
certainly
an
enjoyable
sipping
beer
cheers
d
very
good
and
did
not
disappoint
i
know
my
bottle
was
not
extremely
fresh
but
it
was
well
ahead
of
its
best
by
date
i
would
absolutely
love
to
try
this
fresh
simply
put
a
wonderful
beer
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
what
can
i
say
one
amazing
ale
its
definitely
one
to
drink
at
cellar
temperature
as
it
proved
far
less
enjoyable
while
colder
and
is
easily
the
nicest
tripel
ive
had
although
i
still
wish
i
had
found
the
dubbel
as
i
must
admit
that
despite
the
complexity
and
near
perfection
of
this
brew
i
did
prefer
the
leffe
brune
i
had
prior
to
it
and
am
generally
a
sucker
for
the
malts
present
in
belgian
dark
ale
brews
pours
out
a
brassy
gold
with
a
2
finger
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
1
5
finger
head
head
clings
to
the
glass
and
leaves
sheets
of
lacing
lively
carbonation
keeps
the
head
fluffy
has
a
great
mix
of
pale
malts
crackerlike
grain
and
spicy
yeast
without
letting
things
get
overboard
phenolic
i
get
some
light
apricots
and
alcohol
heat
in
the
nose
taste
is
bready
malts
accented
by
mild
grain
and
candi
sugar
notes
theres
some
refreshing
wheat
cracker
like
flavors
as
well
as
a
drying
mild
tartness
and
some
alcohol
notes
finishes
with
some
herbal
hop
flavor
and
a
perfect
dryness
aftertaste
lingers
on
with
fruits
and
bread
mouthfeel
is
light
enough
from
the
dryness
but
has
a
slight
slickness
from
the
alcohol
carbonation
is
of
tiny
uniform
bubbles
that
ends
up
being
kind
of
smooth
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
can
get
to
be
a
bit
much
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
best
tripel
i
have
ever
tasted
overall
well
balanced
very
drinkable
nectar
of
the
gods
for
sure
these
monks
are
serious
about
beer
poured
an
awesome
golden
color
there
was
not
much
to
the
nose
just
some
yeast
that
i
could
pick
up
the
taste
was
very
light
and
slightly
sweet
it
had
a
bitter
finish
that
lasted
quite
a
while
there
was
a
good
creamy
mouthfeel
that
had
a
good
carbonation
as
well
overall
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
get
it
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
belgian
dgood
the
flavors
really
get
stronger
as
it
warmsi
think
i
started
it
off
too
cold
i
would
have
it
again
this
brew
was
poured
from
a
330
ml
bottle
into
a
ommegang
chalice
it
gave
a
nice
to
inch
white
head
that
had
great
retention
and
left
a
ton
of
lacing
the
color
of
the
brew
was
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
action
and
a
lot
of
swirling
yeast
particles
the
aromas
consisted
of
many
scents
but
fruit
is
what
first
comes
to
mind
pear
and
grape
also
present
is
a
bubble
gum
like
scent
that
is
very
intriguing
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
of
this
brew
but
all
go
together
in
an
excellent
fashion
the
taste
actually
goes
along
with
what
was
found
in
the
nose
but
the
toasted
malt
and
spice
flavor
comes
out
very
nicely
and
complements
everything
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
and
i
can
see
why
it
gets
the
acclaim
that
is
does
pretty
bad
that
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
brew
but
i
can
say
now
that
it
will
not
be
my
last
poured
out
of
a
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
it
is
a
hazy
straw
color
with
hints
of
orange
fantastic
chunky
white
head
that
left
real
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
belgian
yeast
candy
sugar
tart
fruit
the
taste
is
of
apricot
tart
sour
apple
bitter
hop
alcohol
it
has
a
nice
fizzy
carbonation
yet
creamy
and
moderate
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
even
with
the
9
5
abv
very
nice
tripel
the
nectar
of
the
gods
quite
possibly
certainly
my
favorite
tripel
and
a
wonderful
beer
in
general
this
beer
is
truly
a
delight
to
drink
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
given
a
hard
pour
this
had
a
sizable
head
that
eventually
shrunk
to
a
decently
sized
layer
that
retained
really
well
the
bubbles
are
very
small
and
stuck
to
the
glass
the
color
was
a
glowing
opaque
yellowgolden
the
smell
had
some
lemony
bite
to
it
along
with
some
alcohol
theres
more
to
it
i
swear
but
i
just
cant
pick
it
out
same
story
with
the
taste
i
always
find
it
difficult
to
specify
what
fruity
flavors
im
picking
out
with
belgian
beers
here
i
taste
a
bit
of
lemonytartness
granny
smith
apples
and
asian
pear
it
slip
slides
around
also
there
is
some
alcoholic
bite
to
it
along
with
a
balanced
hop
spicyness
thats
why
i
love
belgians
they
balance
the
flavors
oh
so
delicately
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
weak
but
still
enjoyable
it
was
medium
bodied
and
went
down
easy
the
alcohol
sneaked
up
on
me
i
was
telling
my
friend
while
i
was
drinking
this
that
i
wish
it
came
in
six
packs
or
even
24
packs
i
could
have
had
at
least
3
more
of
these
bottles
and
still
loved
it
truly
a
delight
very
drinkable
a
supper
tripel
usually
not
my
style
a
bit
pricey
but
a
nice
holiday
indulgence
easily
sets
the
pace
for
this
style
i
would
fly
to
belgium
for
a
sip
out
of
these
monks
goblets
cloudy
light
gold
pour
with
a
bubbly
head
strong
notes
of
grapes
apple
esters
and
malt
character
on
the
nose
i
couldnt
believe
the
perfect
marriage
of
the
malt
and
alcohol
so
smooth
and
crisp
i
savored
every
drop
the
cleanest
tastiest
beer
ive
had
the
honor
of
sipping
this
tripel
will
blow
your
mind
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
dense
persistant
rocky
head
it
smells
of
peaches
and
apricots
with
just
a
hint
of
pepper
the
taste
is
little
short
of
heaven
no
monk
pun
implied
the
apricot
and
peaches
are
there
along
with
a
flowery
hop
note
and
a
dry
but
savory
finish
showing
that
pepper
and
a
warm
alcohol
note
there
is
a
caramel
malt
overtone
that
mellows
the
flavor
and
binds
it
all
together
in
a
delightful
fashion
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
with
a
satisfying
oily
viscous
quality
that
anchors
the
beers
light
fruity
flavor
drinkability
is
unsurpassed
i
could
drink
these
one
after
the
other
particularly
on
a
warm
afternoon
a
dangerous
thing
when
talking
about
a
9
5
beer
so
beware
and
enjoy
a
good
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
definitely
pleasant
great
beer
high
carbonation
with
a
ray
honey
gold
and
enough
viscocity
to
hold
some
of
the
bubbles
in
place
varieted
white
head
with
some
large
and
some
small
bubbles
belgian
lace
layers
the
glass
as
the
head
falls
mild
fruity
esters
with
a
smell
like
cotton
candy
no
hops
sweet
lemon
upfront
with
carbonic
tingling
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
finish
medium
mouthfeel
with
prickly
co2
very
drinkable
wish
i
had
poured
a
larger
bottle
spectacular
oelergud
it
was
assertive
from
the
start
with
spice
and
a
sharp
alcoholic
burn
it
finished
dry
and
the
carbonation
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
seemed
right
for
the
style
theres
no
doubt
this
is
a
quality
tripel
and
its
high
marks
deserved
still
i
generally
prefer
others

even
ones
ive
rated
slightly
lower
like
gouden
carolus

mainly
because
ive
found
them
a
little
smoother
drinkability
its
no
session
brew
thats
for
sure
but
for
something
over
the
9
plateau
this
goes
down
very
nicely
a
subtle
dry
classic
this
is
better
than
i
remember
it
it
is
an
essential
version
of
a
tripel
this
one
in
particular
is
great
for
consumption
with
food
how
ever
there
are
several
triples
i
might
opt
for
just
drinking
all
the
same
this
is
a
tripel
well
worth
seeking
out
notes
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
this
basically
spells
out
the
guideline
for
the
style
it
has
all
the
characteristics
and
does
them
justice
i
cant
really
detect
the
alcohol
on
the
tounge
just
in
the
head
afterwards
a
wonderful
brew
notes
warning
remember
to
let
the
yeast
settle
and
pour
slowly
pours
out
hazy
golden
with
a
big
head
and
moderate
lacing
malty
smell
with
aromas
of
raisins
and
citrus
flavors
are
similar
to
the
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
otherwise
tastes
wellbalanced
with
both
hoppy
and
malty
characteristics
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
texture
good
appearance
bright
hazy
gold
blondeorange
color
with
the
nice
belgian
lace
traditional
tripel
mix
of
wood
and
alcohol
spicy
aroma
and
flavour
good
body
and
balance
very
hoppy
and
bitter
to
be
a
belgian
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
my
opinion
deceptively
drinkable
which
is
common
for
the
style
its
complex
and
interesting
pretty
much
a
classic
but
not
necessarily
the
best
example
of
a
tripel
d
would
love
many
more
of
these
because
of
the
interesting
interplay
of
taste
characteristics
however
the
abv
would
definitely
keep
consecutive
orders
of
this
one
limited
taste
was
great
strong
alcohol
presence
in
a
good
way
with
zest
and
spice
dinner
was
great
and
after
an
hour
an
a
few
bottles
my
86
year
old
grandfather
was
telling
dirty
jokes
we
all
enjoyed
it
a
true
compliment
to
the

pretty

considering
its

overall
poured
into
a

glass
i
like
it
again
a
drink
that
for
me
needs
to
be
drank
in
moderation
would
suggest
this
to
friends
to
try
a
fantastic
tripel
definitely
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
probably
the
best
example
of
the
style
gouden
carolus
of
st
bernardus
are
better
in
my
opinion
but
not
by
a
whole
heck
of
a
lot
highly
recommended
tripel
right
here
drinkability
so
far
so
bloody
good
hows
that
for
a
review
being
recent
drinkability
i
could
easily
drink
several
but
id
probably
pass
out
in
a
drunken
haze
pretty
quickly
found
at
burby
and
bates
in
orono
only
place
in
the
state
ive
ever
seen
it
slightly
murky

thick

malty
citrusy
and
a
bit
spicy

piney
very

my
favorite

a
very

one
anyway

after
its

i
had
the
first
glass
of
the
750
by
itself
and
then
the
second
adhering
to
the
recommendation
from
the
food
pairing
with
some
mutter
paneer
indian
cuisine
perfect
match
to
clean
the
palate
and
let
each
bite
be
as
good
as
the
first
very
foamy
in
the
mouth
followed
by
mediumtofull
malt
body
that
lingers
lifted
by
the
alcohol
warmth
left
a
crisp
feeling
on
the
palate
but
the
malt
still
lingered
d
thankfully
this
is
really
easy
to
get
and
relatively
inexpensive
its
a
drier
tripel
but
it
has
a
crispnessdryness
that
i
absolutely
crave
this
and
cinq
cents
are
my
goto
tripels
drinks
far
easier
than
the
9
5

would
indicate
this

are
exceedingly
bitter
not
hoppy
bitter
but
like
the

of
a
pecan
bitter

is
nice
and
creamy
yielding
an
excellent
mouthfeel
delightful
except
for
the
aftertaste
overall
a
good
looking
smelling
and
even
tasting
beer
but
the
aftertaste
is
just
bleeech
d
much
better
than
the
westmalle
dubbel
and
very
good
when
compared
to
other
tripels
dangerously
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
dthis
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
right
now
so
complex
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
9
5
an
almost
perfect
tripel
it
just
has
so
much
to
offer
this
was
beyond
tasty
i
recommend
it
highly
overall
very
drinkable
very
well
balanced
beer
none
of
the
parts
overwhelms
the
other
just
a
wonderful
blend
very
impressive
good
beer
overall
but
lacks
a
lot
of
the
qualities
of
a
triple
that
i
look
for
not
bad
at
all
just
not
all
that
great
either
d
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
tripel
but
i
like
the
dubbel
much
better
cloudy
dirty
goldenorange
colour
medium
sized
dense
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
fruits
citrus
lemon
banana
candi
sugar
and
belgian
yeast
some
spiciness
taste
is
fruity
citrus
again
sweet
and
malty
yeasty
and
with
some
spicy
and
herbal
hops
medium
body
with
some
warming
alcohol
the
original
tripel
hides
the
alcohol
well
next
time
i
think
ill
leave
a
centimetre
in
the
bottle
since
it
was
rather
yeasty
beautiful
cloudy
orange
color
with
some
sediment
decent
head
with
good
lace
although
not
much
retension
smells
of
lemon
spice
and
alcohol
good
carbonation
tastes
of
ripe
fruits
with
a
spicy
alcohol
kick
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
smooth
complex
and
delicious
drinkability
a
rather
dispiriting
experience
sadly
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
of
the
trappist
beers
d
another
great
tripel
from
belgium
it
is
one
that
i
will
pick
up
again
and
again
the
pour
into
my
chimay
chalice
yields
an
immovable
subone
finger
head
just
the
slightest
hint
of
tan
the
body
is
a
murky
yellow
with
a
lot
of
floaties
even
after
sitting
in
my
cellar
for
a
year
and
a
half
inche
left
in
the
bottle
smell
is
richly
aromatic
of
caramel
and
candi
sugar
cloves
scent
perhaps
mildly
spicy
from
the
alcohol
taste
is
milder
than
the
smell
earthy
peppery
candi
sweet
mildly
acidic
very
smooth
theres
a
nice
citrus
zest
to
it
as
well
although
it
finishes
somewhat
dry
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
very
high
leading
to
an
almost
effervescent
feeling
a
nice
drinker
to
be
sure
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
and
doesnt
overwhelm
with
sweetness
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
thick
white
foamy
head
that
hung
around
until
mid
glass
and
left
decent
lacing
at
first
aroma
was
spicy
fruity
apples
and
grapes
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
as
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
became
more
dominant
in
the
aroma
although
fruit
was
still
slightly
noticeable
flavor
was
similar
to
aroma
with
alcohol
presence
continuing
to
strenghten
as
beer
warmed
although
fruit
especially
apples
remained
strong
as
well
my
only
critcism
of
this
beer
is
that
the
strong
alcohol
presence
influenced
the
finish
more
than
i
would
have
liked
but
still
a
good
beer
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
average
sized
frothy
white
head
that
lasted
at
about
a
half
centimeter
for
the
entire
beer
lemon
and
zesty
grains
aroma
and
fruity
like
white
grapes
the
taste
has
an
array
of
fruity
flavors
grapes
pears
apple
peels
apricot
peach
and
there
is
a
candylike
sweetness
a
bit
spicy
as
well
with
some
grassyearthy
hops
some
belgian
yeast
flavor
but
overall
its
more
about
the
very
sweet
fruitiness
refreshing
body
not
quite
sparkling
but
not
quite
sticky
mainly
just
belly
warming
from
the
alcohol
way
too
easy
to
drink
try
it
on
your
next
trip
simply
outstanding
all
the
flavors
of
a
tripel
without
being
a
sweet
dessert
beverage
not
my
favorite
trappiste
tripe
but
certainly
worth
a
tilt
for
those
looking
for
a
more
bitter
tart
belgian
brew
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
with
freshness
date
lots
of
carb
and
initial
foam
color
was
a
solid
light
gold
mine
had
a
lot
of
yeast
floating
around
it
in
so
not
sure
if
best
sample
or
not
so
will
try
again
had
nice
sweet
aroma
typical
of
the
style
tast
was
excellent
but
had
a
tad
too
much
alcohol
taste
to
make
me
want
to
drink
another
soon
unlike
allagash
tripel
which
i
could
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
overall
a
great
tripel
and
highly
recommended
4
0rbty
overall
impression
wow
these
trappist
cats
or
should
i
say
monks
sure
know
how
to
brew
up
a
great
tripel
the
bubble
gum
flavor
makes
this
ale
stand
out
nice
and
refreshing
with
a
huge
alcohol
burn
nice
defiantly
grip
a
bottle
of
this
one
d
a
great
brew
problaby
my
favorite
tripel
something
i
would
recomend
and
have
bought
repeatedly
drinkability
great
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
just
like
their
dubbel
westmalles
tripel
could
be
considered
a
standard
of
the
style
exceptional
overall
an
excellent
tripel
perhaps
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
pretty
good
possible
my
favorite
trappist
tripel
i
have
had
to
date
went
down
nice
and
had
a
highly
refreshing
finish
overall
a
great
tripel
i
like
this
much
better
than
the
st
bernardus
tripel
highly
recommended
drinkabilityoverall
very
drinkable
nice
and
light
hoppiness
suggests
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
along
the
lines
of
houblon
chouffe
but
with
their
history
ill
take
their
word
for
it
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
if
i
could
afford
a
drink
a
bunch
at
a
time
i
would
o
man
no
secrets
here
i
love
this
one
pours
a
beautiful
orangygold
color
with
a
huge
glorious
white
head
that
leaves
a
masterpiece
of
lacing
in
the
westmalle
goblet
the
nose
is
of
belgian
candy
sugar
spices
and
citrus
lemons
some
notes
of
yeasty
breads
are
here
too
palate
is
so
complex
to
me
sweet
confectioners
sugar
cloves
and
yeast
but
has
a
nice
hoppy
character
throughout
very
lively
and
active
lightmedium
mouthfeel
great
carbonation
zing
and
a
nice
clean
finish
the
alcohol
is
rather
well
hidden
making
this
a
supremely
drinkable
belgian
treasure
taste
the
age
came
through
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
although
carbonation
was
still
in
great
shape
it
made
me
think
of
an
old
attic
or
dusty
basement
but
in
a
good
fond
memory
kind
of
way
i
was
expecting
the
alcohol
to
be
much
more
prevalent
but
it
wasnt
playing
the
diva
at
all
even
though
it
was
bone
dry
in
the
finish
the
yeast
was
perfectly
balanced
along
with
it
and
had
a
great
body
to
hold
it
all
in
place
a
classic
overall
more
flavorful
and
smooth
drinking
than
your
average
tripel
d
smooth
and
relaxing
this
beer
tasted
great
an
di
could
easily
go
for
plenty
more
of
them
this
is
my
first
go
with
a
true
belgian
tripel
since
i
could
only
afford
one
bottle
i
followed
it
up
with
an
american
trippel
counterpart
no
comparison
if
only
it
werent
4
50
a
bottle
this
poured
with
a
large
persistent
head
it
has
a
cloudy
apricot
color
the
smell
is
very
floral
this
has
a
sweet
initial
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
a
toasted
nut
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
bright
crisp
and
carbonated
the
alcohol
is
pronounced
after
the
beer
has
been
consumed
what
a
delightful
beer
that
would
be
very
drinkable
often
drinkability
as
i
said
above
the
alcohol
was
masked
very
well
but
what
makes
this
a
great
beer
is
that
it
went
with
every
food
i
ate
bleu
cheese
steak
pastrami
chicken
in
cilantro
sauce
yams
unbelievable
love
the
belgiums
hard
to
do
poorly
wonderfully
diverse
the
flavor
was
slightly
smoky
with
crisp
bitterness
and
hops
there
as
some
mild
tartness
in
the
finish
as
a
tripel
its
characteristics
in
general
supprised
me
more
bitter
and
lighter
in
collor
most
specificaly
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
ertainly
not
my
favorite
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
a
consumately
drinkable
beer
dry
finish
complex
flavor
wellhidden
alcohol
not
a
whole
lot
more
to
ask
for
taste
is
well
balanced
but
leans
towards
the
sweet
side
alcohol
is
well
disguized
but
the
mouthfeel
is
where
it
loses
me
this
bottle
which
i
assume
is
fresh
im
only
a
few
hundred
ks
away
from
the
brewery
is
way
way
too
carbonated
champagnelike
and
this
hurts
my
drinkability
poured
an
orange
yellow
color
with
a
medium
sized
rocky
white
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
seemed
somewhat
old
with
oxidation
citrus
fruits
toffee
yeast
and
alcohol
i
found
an
initial
bite
in
the
taste
with
some
citrus
fruits
white
pepper
and
an
alcohol
character
in
the
background
smooths
out
as
it
goes
down
overall
great
appearance
but
i
hope
the
other
trappist
beers
hold
up
to
their
reputation
with
the
taste
this
one
displays
a
sort
of
sunburst
pattern
when
eyed
whilst
it
rests
in
the
goblet
glass
the
center
of
the
half
circle
is
more
of
an
orange
colour
than
the
golden
hues
that
flourish
on
the
edges
around
this
darker
core
yip
a
matress
of
luscious
white
presides
over
the
event
and
is
continually
fed
from
plentiful
springs
of
gas
the
nose
is
a
bit
blunt
it
smells
of
a
dull
spiciness
the
sweet
tones
are
not
as
prevalent
as
i
had
expected
this
smells
quite
raw
and
earthy
if
you
want
to
know
what
earthy
is
earthy
is
a
more
poetic
way
to
say
it
smells
like
barks
and
rind
and
other
organic
debris
and
natural
shit
have
been
introduced
to
the
mixture
by
some
means
raw
varies
by
degree
raw
is
a
facet
of
earthy
that
denotes
level
of
perceived
rotten
ambiance
this
one
is
low
on
raw
but
it
is
a
bit
raw
some
degree
of
rot
is
always
suitable
and
needed
for
character
so
you
see
earthy
and
raw
sound
better
as
such
than
do
the
aforementioned
descriptives
thin
layers
of
banana
and
sugar
lay
underneath
these
assertive
rough
textures
in
time
a
more
acidic
and
fruity
nose
crops
up
and
becomes
noticeable
the
taste
shows
the
sweet
and
fruity
aspects
boastfully
it
has
a
tang
to
it
that
reminds
me
of
some
acidophilus
barrel
dweller
she
is
sweet
up
front
moving
purposefully
to
a
sudden
bitterness
that
is
again
overtaken
by
sweet
in
the
finish
it
unfolds
like
the
tortoise
and
the
hare
the
mouthfeel
projects
a
creaminess
to
bolster
the
lighter
qualities
of
the
liquid
the
end
result
is
another
stellar
belgian
beer
otherworldly
in
a
sense
right
on
you
jean
claude
van
dammes
the
pour
was
nice
very
nice
colour
very
characteristic
of
its
style
the
smell
was
fruity
and
airy
with
spicy
notes
popping
up
from
within
first
swig
i
noticed
a
nice
taste
of
citrusy
pleasure
followed
by
a
small
bite
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
not
overpowering
and
very
expected
from
a
tripel
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
well
made
beer
its
reputation
preceeds
it
very
well
and
i
will
jot
this
one
down
of
beers
to
bring
back
from
europe
during
next
years
business
trip
what
a
wonderful
beer
lively
flavorful
alluring
unique
commands
your
attention
by
the
way
if
you
are
looking
for
this
on
long
island
ny
whole
foods
in
manhasset
on
25anorthern
blvd
has
this
among
others
and
that
particular
store
is
one
of
the
three
regular
retailers
to
have
it
in
metronyc
drinkability
this
a
powerful
beer
both
in
flavor
and
in
alcohol
but
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
it
has
all
the
depth
flavor
and
boldness
of
a
red
wine
making
it
a
great
pair
for
beef
drinkability
suffers
from
the
alcohol
burn
but
it
isnt
bad
in
the
end
a
decent
triple
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
very
drinkable
which
is
scary
this
beer
has
a
high
alcohol
content
9
5
abv
that
is
not
apparent
when
drinking
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
two
or
three
of
these
before
you
realize
whats
happening
drinkability
past
its
prime
not
sure
other
people
think
the
same
about
the
alcohol
maybe
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
for
a
tripel
i
still
have
a
bomber
of
this
stashed
away
within
its
best
by
period
ill
have
to
bust
it
out
real
soon
for
comparrison
however
the
mouthfeel
alone
isnt
enough
to
bring
me
back
for
another
one
of
these
any
time
soon
a
lower
abv
may
have
helped
to
compliment
the
subtlety
of
the
flavour
profile
more
as
the
two
arent
jiving
particularly
well
for
now
since
id
much
rather
be
dancing
with
the
wallflower
rather
than
the
boozy
partner
that
keeps
rubbing
up
against
me
every
time
i
turn
around
and
take
a
sip
this
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
giant
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
strong
with
coriander
floralmalt
candy
sugar
and
apricot
the
taste
is
very
good
with
all
the
aromas
mentioned
along
with
fruit
pepper
and
some
citruslemon
the
mf
is
light
and
smoothperfectly
mixed
making
this
one
of
the
truely
great
beers
in
the
world
d
drinkable
to
a
point
high
abv
like
all
tripels
i
do
love
the
style
but
i
think
there
are
better
ones
out
there
for
cheaper
i
would
assume
the
higher
price
is
based
on
it
being
a
trappist
and
travel
costs
etc
a
good
one
to
try
though
nine
years
old
and
only
showing
some
subdued
character
with
a
lower
carbonation
level
some
slight
oxidation
shows
itself
in
the
quaninelike
wince
in
the
nose
and
a
hint
of
wet
paper
in
the
finish
i
will
revisit
this
again
in
the
future
westmalle
trappist
tripel
pours
a
luminescent
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
from
a
brown
33cl
bottle
aroma
is
dominated
by
an
apricot
like
smell
which
is
quite
nice
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
noticeable
too
sparkly
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
to
me
also
fruit
is
present
but
the
finish
is
definitely
spicy
very
interesting
beer
im
going
to
have
to
revisit
this
one
recommended
not
my
cup
of
tea
not
very
drinkable
and
too
sharpharsh
to
be
savored
slowly
perhaps
a
year
or
two
in
cellar
will
mellow
it
but
drunk
fresh
its
pretty
harsh
like
a
high
classed
euro
strong
beer
i
echo
oakes
sentiment
what
the
hell
is
so
special
about
this
a
smooth
ride
considering
the
alcohol
content
you
can
definitely
sip
the
night
away
with
as
many
of
these
as
you
want
d
very
drinkable
potent
tripel
one
of
the
best
ive
had
cheers
again
this
is
a
highly
unique
beer
at
least
coming
from
the
perspective
of
someone
whos
not
too
wellversed
in
this
style
this
is
the
second
westmalle
tripel
ive
had
and
there
will
definitely
be
a
third
but
probably
not
for
some
time
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
if
im
going
to
drink
a
westmalle
id
prefer
the
dubbel
all
in
all
a
very
nice
tripel
unique
this
poured
a
light
copper
with
a
bright
white
head
and
active
carbonation
the
smell
seemed
muted
a
bit
of
clove
and
some
citrus
friut
not
much
else
the
taste
makes
up
for
the
smell
orange
candy
and
a
peppery
spicy
bite
the
alcohol
is
hidden
in
the
taste
but
i
can
feel
it
warming
my
stomach
light
mouthfeel
highly
carbonated
to
add
to
the
peppery
bite
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
drinkability
this
is
tough
its
very
good
but
i
think
the
high
alcohol
9
5
abv
it
loses
alot
of
the
drinkable
nature
also
the
carbonation
which
is
still
very
active
is
very
filling
i
found
myself
burping
yeasty
sweet
hop
bombs
for
a
few
hours
after
having
it
its
very
good
and
as
many
have
stated
this
is
the
mother
of
all
tripels
i
cannot
drink
more
than
one
per
sitting
but
with
the
high
etoh
i
dont
wantneed
more
than
one
a
fulfilling
sipper
a
nice
balance
between
the
many
different
flavors
and
pretty
damn
drinkable
at
9
5abv
a
remarkably
clean
tripel
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
when
its
this
green
but
still
an
exceptionally
easy
beer
to
drink
the
abv
weighsin
at
9
5
so
be
careful
of
a
boomerang
next
time
ill
stockup
on
several
and
cellar
them
for
a
year
or
two
should
help
smoothout
the
finish
great
beer
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
i
found
myself
wanting
one
or
two
or
three
more
bad
idea
with
9
5
abv
beware
but
then
drink
it
anyway
drinkability
the
high
abv
alone
limits
this
to
one
serving
of
750
ml
or
two
12
oz
ers
etc
you
get
the
idea
but
for
me
this
just
wasnt
something
id
want
another
one
of
at
any
rate
the
diacetyl
and
alcohol
taste
pretty
much
ruin
this
for
me
d
very
tasty
beer
one
of
my
favourite
tripels
d
drinkable
good
beer
really
great
and
unique
we
can
say
this
is
one
of
a
kind
for
sure
gold
in
colour
with
a
floatie
or
two
and
well
carbonated
pleasing
aromas
of
macintosh
apple
pear
and
a
bit
of
spicy
yeast
the
fruit
flavors
become
more
lemon
like
on
the
palate
and
mix
well
with
the
light
malt
and
mild
grassy
hop
notes
surprisingly
bitter
finish
with
notes
of
lemon
rind
at
the
end
a
bit
too
dry
for
the
style
imo
if
thats
even
possible
not
bad
but
could
be
better
very
close
to
perfect
beer
for
me
the
quintessential
tripel
smooth
fruity
highly
alcoholic
only
but
not
in
the
tatse
at
all
it
is
well
hidden
under
all
the
spices
and
malts
that
this
beer
has
this
is
golden
and
pale
yet
packs
vibrant
flavors
and
the
punch
of
alcohol
when
imbibed
savor
slowly
in
the
proper
goblet
to
enjoy
this
beer
at
its
best
this
beer
definitely
improves
as
you
progress
through
it
i
also
admit
the
beer
may
originally
have
been
too
cold
after
the
first
sip
and
my
my
mouth
adjusted
to
this
powerful
belgian
this
is
an
original
beer
not
quite
like
any
beer
that
i
can
remember
having
it
took
me
a
minute
before
i
was
able
to
figure
out
that
this
is
a
really
good
beer
if
you
like
belgians
youll
most
certainly
want
to
try
this
light
gold
dry
spicy
and
very
yeasty
aroma
with
scents
of
sweet
fruity
pale
malts
herbs
bubble
gum
lemon
tropical
fruits
and
noble
hops
strong
bubble
gum
notes
continue
on
towards
the
flavor
profile
especially
on
the
finish
along
with
notes
of
cotton
candy
lemon
and
fruit
a
nice
beer
but
there
are
so
many
better
example
of
the
style
drinkability
the
ale
is
limited
as
most
belgians
are
by
the
high
abv
despite
that
this
beer
is
very
good
and
i
certainly
recommend
it
im
getting
this
again
drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
flavorable
tripel
good
mouthfeel
also
helps
this
one
out
alot
another
westmalle
brew
thats
right
on
style
light
malt
light
bread
and
sweet
dough
offwhite
creamy
head
that
was
gone
in
60
seconds
a
bit
haxy
with
some
small
particles
moderate
sweet
flavor
that
lasted
a
lont
time
texture
was
dry
with
lively
carbonation
there
was
a
moderate
alcohol
finish
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
a
touch
alcoholic
balanced
nicely
with
some
bready
malts
a
clean
finish
and
a
slightly
sour
character
alcohol
character
hurts
the
drinkability
some
without
going
into
too
much
detail
this
is
a
well
described
beer
on
this
database
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
an
excellent
tripel
though
not
my
all
time
favourite
one
it
is
very
consistent
and
ages
well
this
stuff
is
absolutely
absurd
its
got
a
noticeable
sweetness
a
broad
palette
of
fruity
flavors
and
a
warming
alcohol
prescence
that
hides
itself
and
is
perceived
as
a
spicyness
the
real
difficulty
with
this
particular
beer
is
taking
in
the
breadth
of
flavors
that
are
available
before
one
has
consumed
too
much
of
the
stuff
to
be
all
that
perceptive
this
might
be
the
central
paradox
of
beer
tasting
or
at
least
belgian
beer
tasting
anyway
i
can
tell
you
this
ive
tried
the
st
bernardus
tirpel
and
the
allagash
reserve
tripel
and
this
one
just
absolutely
trounces
both
of
them
in
my
opinion
amazing
stuff
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
the
dubbel
due
to
the
more
noticeable
alcohol
but
still
a
great
beer
perfect
nightcap
beer
on
a
cool
night
mouthfeeldrinkability
soft
and
mellow
in
the
mouth
especially
for
the
strength
and
complexity
of
the
nose
and
taste
goes
down
smooth
and
the
beers
warmth
takes
over
and
softens
all
the
edges
i
want
to
go
to
belgium
now
and
be
a
monk
that
brews
great
beer
cheers2beers
mouth
went
downhill
a
tad
too
highly
carbonated
resulting
in
a
foamy
feel
along
with
a
strong
presence
of
alcohol
i
could
still
sip
one
bottle
for
an
hour
but
the
foamy
mouthfeel
was
annoying
yes
according
style
a
nice
beer
but
i
prefer
westmalle
dubbel
mouthfeel
is
great
this
brew
teases
the
taste
buds
and
makes
you
want
another
sip
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
a
repeat
purchase
with
the
wellhidden
alcohol
this
one
is
almost
too
easy
to
drink
several
of
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
one
glass
seem
not
enough
i
will
be
having
another
ive
heard
so
many
good
things
about
belgian
trappist
ales
that
i
had
to
finally
try
one
pours
a
straw
gold
the
beer
is
effervescent
constantly
bubbling
had
an
incredibly
thick
white
head
with
brown
fleks
of
yeast
the
head
lingered
throughout
the
experience
the
first
taste
demonstrated
the
beers
strong
alcohol
content
9
5
with
its
flavor
standing
out
more
with
every
sip
the
closest
comparision
i
can
make
is
that
this
tastes
like
a
thinner
doppelbock
overall
a
very
enjoyable
strong
beer
this
is
just
the
tiniest
bit
uninteresting
but
thats
actually
a
good
thing
a
lot
of
belgians
manage
to
offend
but
this
one
does
absolutely
nothing
wrong
those
monks
sure
know
what
the
heck
theyre
doing
this
a
slow
goer
at
around
4
an
11
oz
bottle
it
should
be
add
its
strength
and
barleywine
bitterness
and
youve
got
two
more
speed
bumps
of
savoring
enjoyment
to
keep
you
paced
very
pleasant
beer
330
ml
bottle
with
110707
printed
on
the
label
it
pours
into
the
chalice
a
glowing
gold
with
some
sediment
lots
of
carbonation
beads
and
a
34
white
head
which
is
pretty
sticky
there
are
aromas
of
spicysharp
phenols
medicinerubber
glove
sweentess
a
grassymusty
character
and
some
fruits
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
some
powdery
yeast
and
a
medium
body
overall
its
good
but
i
was
expecting
something
much
better
considering
this
is
the
posterchild
for
tripels
maybe
it
was
an
off
bottle
but
either
way
im
sure
ill
get
around
to
sampling
another
one
the
end
taste
also
brings
a
good
smoothness
that
makes
it
so
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
an
impressive
that
deserves
a
high
rating
starts
out
with
a
blistering
apricottropical
sweetness
that
makes
its
way
towards
the
hops
then
grapes
and
finally
a
nice
dry
vinous
finish
with
just
slight
notes
of
coriander
and
whiskey
the
glowing
orange
appearance
and
healthy
dollop
of
cream
make
it
quite
the
looker
as
well
perhaps
the
best
tripel
ive
had
and
certainly
the
most
drinkable
a
truly
top
notch
beer
this
beer
might
be
a
good
session
beer
if
the
alcohol
content
was
just
a
tad
lower
it
is
a
good
beer
though
well
worth
it
d
a
medfull
bodied
dryishbitter
tripel
it
is
not
as
approachable
as
my
last
bottle
maybe
due
to
the
fact
that
before
serving
the
beer
was
slightly
overchilled
hence
the
farely
cloudy
body
from
the
very
beginning
one
cant
deny
that
its
an
uncompromising
beer
though
and
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
more
complex
and
fuller
elder
brother
of
the
westmalle
dubbel
pours
a
pale
yellowish
orange
with
a
12
inch
head
that
reduces
itself
to
a
nice
film
there
are
lively
streams
of
bubbles
and
the
beer
looks
a
bit
cloudy
also
the
smell
is
citrusy
and
spicy
with
floral
hints
and
an
aroma
of
orange
peel
the
taste
is
a
fairly
sweet
malt
with
notes
of
banana
citrus
and
spices
its
also
tarty
with
an
alcoholic
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
smooth
and
rich
not
overly
thick
although
it
seems
to
coat
the
tongue
well
it
has
a
great
flavor
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
overpowering
making
it
less
easy
to
drink
this
beer
looks
simply
wonderful
thick
white
head
light
gold
color
slightly
cloudy
with
some
periling
racing
up
the
side
of
the
class
nice
lasting
head
and
an
ever
present
lace
aroma
is
a
bit
yeasty
apple
and
green
grapes
taste
is
sweet
fruit
and
mild
musty
bitter
bite
in
the
end
the
9
5
is
nicely
hidden
in
this
brew
overall
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
brew
and
at
5
03
for
a
750
ml
with
tax
i
will
be
enjoying
this
offer
more
often
if
you
see
it
one
the
shelf
pick
it
up
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
would
give
it
a
5
for
drinkability
however
the
high
abv
would
sneak
up
on
you
monks
what
cant
they
do
750
ml
bottle
pours
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
good
white
head
mostly
lasting
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
of
purfume
spruce
pine
and
soft
malts
dry
smooth
texture
taste
has
a
smooth
light
acidic
with
a
good
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
also
somewhat
easy
to
locate
it
is
a
good
start
to
the
belgium
beers
poured
into
an
orval
goblet
this
was
a
hazy
lemon
juice
color
with
plenty
of
bits
floating
around
nose
was
pleasant
soft
and
fruity
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
sting
on
the
sinus
as
well
hits
the
palate
with
a
distinct
belgian
crispness
tingly
and
somewhat
medicinal
but
extremely
complex
a
hard
beer
to
review
really
due
to
the
different
flavors
mixing
with
each
sip
its
hard
to
pick
things
out
definite
fruitiness
with
applespears
along
with
some
herbal
and
floral
accents
as
well
a
really
nice
beer
to
crack
after
the
seahawks
nfc
championship
win
tonight
d
good
this
would
go
well
will
some
foods
abv
makes
sessioning
a
bad
idea
i
will
have
to
have
this
again
sometime
a
nice
warm
feeling
from
the
abv
is
most
pleasent
i
enjoy
sitting
down
and
savoring
a
westmalle
every
now
and
then
its
got
a
wonderful
sweet
and
earthy
aroma
nice
head
retention
and
great
legs
it
has
great
balance
in
the
mouth
and
the
high
abv
doesebnt
really
come
through
at
all
aside
from
that
initial
warm
feeling
i
get
when
i
take
my
first
sip
this
is
a
great
beer
sometimes
overshadowed
by
westy
and
rocheforte
but
for
me
never
a
disappointment
probably
the
only
beer
ive
ever
given
a
5
for
appearance
pours
a
hazy
almost
burnt
gold
with
a
magnificent
offwhite
head
that
leaves
incredible
lacing
and
retains
impressively
the
aroma
starts
off
with
a
big
citrus
fruit
element
tangerine
apricot
lemon
zest
straw
biscuit
candied
sugar
spices
and
some
ethanol
the
flavor
is
also
initially
very
fruity
with
big
apricot
tangerinepear
peach
and
lemon
character
as
well
as
some
damp
straw
candied
sugar
herbal
and
mineraly
hops
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
an
astringent
and
slightly
tart
finish
with
some
alcohol
warmth
drinkability
is
unparalleled
for
a
tripel
i
find
most
too
herbal
spicy
or
alcoholic
an
excellent
example
of
a
tripel
perhaps
the
best
there
is
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
tart
had
the
bottled
version
of
this
beer
in
a
beer
tasting
event
i
have
it
before
and
equally
enjoyed
it
then
it
pours
a
orangegold
color
with
a
good
head
that
says
around
nice
herbal
and
fruity
bouquet
it
has
a
nice
smooth
sweetness
that
is
offset
by
crispness
as
well
the
taste
has
flavors
of
fermented
fruits
and
bananas
with
maybe
a
hint
of
peach
i
really
like
this
beer
its
tasty
and
very
drinkable
the
traditional
westmalle
goblet
already
waits
at
home
for
its
next
victim
i
have
tasted
this
beer
on
numerous
occasions
and
it
is
really
striking
to
find
that
every
time
it
tastes
different
this
might
come
from
the
variation
in
brewing
but
i
think
it
is
mostly
due
to
the
unique
yeast
being
used
that
reacts
to
small
changes
in
its
environement
like
temperature
and
nutrients
this
is
a
must
taste
beer
this
beer
is
terrific
it
looks
like
apple
cider
with
bits
of
the
apple
still
floating
around
in
it
smell
is
also
similar
to
cider
with
a
tart
almost
sour
quality
that
dominates
the
nose
when
its
initailly
sipped
there
is
not
a
lot
of
taste
but
as
it
goes
down
you
can
taste
it
explode
like
most
tripels
you
can
taste
a
hint
of
the
highalcohol
content
but
its
almost
entirely
masked
there
is
a
distinct
crispness
to
it
that
is
not
found
in
many
other
beers
but
its
still
so
well
balanced
that
it
goes
down
very
easy
this
is
hands
down
the
best
triple
ive
ever
had
its
understated
flavor
and
complex
blend
of
flavors
makes
this
a
fantastic
beer
ill
be
back
d
this
beer
is
very
soft
and
smooth
but
it
has
lots
of
complexity
its
hard
to
describe
all
the
distinct
taste
as
they
all
blend
from
one
to
the
other
theres
really
not
much
to
say
that
hasnt
been
said
already
about
this
brew
those
monks
sure
know
what
theyre
doing
pours
a
cloudy
brownorange
with
a
huge
head
head
was
so
huge
that
i
kept
having
to
wait
for
it
to
settlewhich
took
forever
before
i
could
pour
more
in
plenty
of
lace
sticking
to
the
chalice
smells
of
pungent
alcohol
grapes
biscuits
lemon
grassiness
and
spices
very
fruit
and
spicey
taste
bit
of
lemons
apricots
and
pepper
wrapped
in
an
earthy
malt
tone
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
and
slick
very
drinkable
drinkabitlity
not
my
thing
could
tone
down
the
hops
and
have
a
slightly
thicker
body
nor
do
i
taste
it
there
is
an
alcohol
presence
that
is
very
obvious
but
it
works
with
the
flavor
enhancing
it
rather
than
dominating
it
i
look
at
the
abv
as
a
warning
sip
this
750ml
bottle
slowly
man
i
can
almost
hear
this
beer
advising
me
wow
i
am
not
disappointed
this
one
kicks
ass
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
it
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
great
head
it
smells
floral
and
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
wonderfully
complex
the
fruity
yeast
flavor
has
many
layers
i
detect
apples
and
oranges
and
just
an
overall
fruity
sweetness
the
alcohol
comes
through
although
this
is
nonetheless
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
pours
a
beautiful
golden
brown
color
with
a
strong
head
and
lacing
smells
of
sweet
hops
with
woody
flavors
with
undertones
of
orange
and
apple
has
a
calming
affect
that
is
really
nice
feels
slightly
warm
and
smooth
in
your
mouth
goes
down
warm
and
smooth
carbonation
is
well
done
and
this
is
an
enjoyable
sipping
beer
what
a
fabulous
beer
pours
a
beautiful
murky
gold
with
a
lush
velvetty
head
some
nice
lace
remains
on
the
sides
the
smell
is
floral
and
malty
with
some
alcohol
esters
and
kind
of
a
dandelion
heather
combination
in
the
floral
aspect
strong
effervescence
in
the
mouthfeel
provides
an
excellent
finishing
sensation
to
a
great
beer
drinkability
is
excellent
for
a
beer
of
this
potency
outstanding
drinkability
fanastic
this
makes
me
want
to
try
the
westmalle
dubbel
a
near
perfect
sipper
too
high
feeling
a
bit
lightheaded
already
but
so
good
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
all
night
would
be
something
like
an
1
hr
then
id
fall
asleep
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
large
white
head
that
is
very
slow
to
dissipate
remaining
until
i
finished
the
beer
lacing
is
substantial
smell
is
very
complex
with
bready
notes
spices
cloves
peppery
hints
and
an
underlying
alcoholic
flavour
tastes
fruitier
than
id
expected
with
some
banana
and
sweetness
along
with
some
very
nice
spices
cloves
obvious
and
apparent
hot
alcohol
which
was
still
pretty
wellhidden
for
9
5
feels
thick
and
creamy
just
beautiful
and
is
very
drinkable
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
as
far
as
im
concerned
just
great
okay
so
i
picked
up
a
750
ml
of
this
one
because
it
happened
to
be
the
exact
same
price
as
12
fl
oz
go
figure
it
pours
out
nicely
amber
body
with
a
frothy
pillowy
white
head
could
appear
more
carbonated
but
the
head
remains
thick
and
tall
the
entire
time
i
drink
this
the
smell
is
earthy
and
grassy
a
little
sugary
but
not
anything
for
me
to
complain
or
boast
about
too
eagerly
the
taste
is
pretty
average
though
it
is
not
particularly
special
as
far
as
the
style
goes
the
alcohol
shines
out
a
little
too
much
overall
it
is
an
earthy
yeasty
grassy
flavor
no
real
deep
complexity
to
talk
about
it
makes
for
an
average
medium
mouthfeel
surprisingly
not
as
alcohol
warming
as
i
might
expect
from
the
flavor
drinkability
is
decent
but
because
there
are
so
many
excellent
members
of
the
style
available
i
cant
give
it
high
marks
in
this
category
this
beer
poured
to
a
quickly
forming
slowly
dissipating
white
head
smell
is
smoky
and
woody
quite
nice
actually
taste
is
not
terrible
but
rather
harsh
as
reflected
in
its
rather
high
abv
mouthfeel
is
equally
as
harsh
the
high
abv
is
once
again
this
beer
is
to
be
sipped
and
savored
overall
not
too
bad
but
at
the
same
time
hard
to
swallow
not
something
to
be
consumed
in
excess
but
something
to
enjoy
every
now
and
again
in
small
quantities
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
hide
the
alcohol
that
well
to
be
very
drinkable
maybe
my
tastebuds
arent
ready
for
the
style
overall
i
did
enjoy
it
but
im
not
rushing
to
try
it
again
d
incredibly
drinkable
considering
the
strengthstyle
d
im
actually
not
really
wowed
by
this
one
by
no
means
a
bad
tripel
but
it
doesnt
leave
me
running
back
for
more
hands
down
one
the
best
tripels
ive
ever
had
complex
and
guaranteed
to
stimulate
the
taste
buds
mighty
enjoyable
recommended
i
find
this
to
be
a
killer
brew
woowed
me
from
the
pour
cheers
anyway
but
for
the
price
tag
i
would
buy
cases
of
this
stuff
notes
had
this
beer
with
thanksgiving
dinner
which
made
an
excellent
compliment
to
turkey
blaukraut
mashed
potatos
and
lamb
drinkability
with
its
tannic
bitterness
this
is
not
a
beer
i
want
to
consume
in
quantity
but
it
is
an
interesting
change
of
pace
and
would
work
well
with
sharp
cheese
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
semitransparent
pale
orange
color
the
onefinger
head
is
white
and
creamy
lacing
is
thorough
the
aroma
is
huge
juicy
orange
peel
spices
the
taste
is
full
and
juicy
orange
peel
dominates
the
sip
leading
into
a
tangy
finish
and
onto
a
warm
alcoholic
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
overall
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
pours
a
hazy
golden
honey
colour
almost
seeming
to
glow
from
within
with
a
thick
and
lacy
white
head
aroma
was
apples
sweet
malts
caramel
banana
and
spice
taste
was
a
very
strong
sweet
honey
up
front
with
a
clovey
spicy
middle
and
some
balancing
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
very
smooth
even
with
the
effervescence
the
high
abv
is
well
hidden
but
is
definitely
warming
on
the
tongue
and
throat
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
fantastic
tripel
but
definitely
not
a
session
beer
one
a
day
is
enough
overall
a
great
beer
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
the
aroma
was
excellent
lots
of
banana
candy
sugar
clove
citrus
and
sweet
fruits
the
bouquet
was
almost
enough
to
sit
and
enjoy
but
the
taste
was
something
else
as
well
you
could
definitely
detect
a
large
ammount
of
alcohol
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
is
actually
present
it
is
wellhidden
behind
a
complex
taste
of
clove
spice
sugars
mild
hoppiness
yeasts
and
bananas
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
carbonated
yet
not
very
biting
its
creamy
and
refreshing
and
is
absolutely
excellent
to
the
last
sip
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
beer
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
tripels
like
me
i
just
recently
rediscovered
the
tripel
and
im
trying
to
hit
all
the
big
ones
again
and
reevaluate
appears
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
some
yeast
swimming
around
big
white
head
that
doesnt
quite
last
smell
is
very
grainy
full
of
yeast
and
a
strong
pizza
dough
scent
as
well
as
some
almost
tart
grassy
scents
taste
has
a
soft
sweet
malt
backbone
light
grassy
hops
accent
a
spicy
yeasty
estery
taste
a
slight
alcohol
kick
gives
this
beer
a
nice
edge
love
the
balance
between
sweet
and
spicy
nice
and
subtly
complex
and
balanced
enough
to
pull
it
off
gotta
hand
it
to
the
trappist
monks
once
again
my
favorite
beer
wellbalanced
complexity
with
nice
warming
alcohol
presence
that
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
every
time
i
drink
one
of
these
i
notice
something
new
in
the
layers
of
flavor
and
aroma
never
boring
always
amazing
pours
a
beautiful
goldne
orange
with
a
white
froth
head
that
rises
and
rises
setiments
of
yeast
will
fall
into
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
apricots
with
a
nice
honey
grain
a
hint
of
banana
yeast
will
water
the
mouth
cloves
and
other
spices
will
creep
in
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
toasty
banana
liquor
a
apricot
sauce
will
add
sweetness
exotic
spices
will
warm
the
throat
definetely
a
strong
toasty
beer
bottle
dated
020906
poured
a
hazy
light
yellow
color
with
monstrous
white
head
that
left
beautiful
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
fruity
sugary
yeasty
and
just
absolutely
fantastic
taste
is
fruity
yeasty
with
hints
of
lemon
superb
finishes
soft
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
warming
feeling
from
the
alcohol
a
too
easy
to
drink
beer
for
9
5
this
is
a
very
nice
enjoyable
tripel
luscious
this
is
fine
fine
beer
perfectly
balancedimmensely
flavorful
without
being
overwhelming
the
beer
is
full
and
peppery
after
my
first
sip
the
beer
almost
has
a
creamy
consistency
and
the
spice
notes
give
it
a
piquant
sharpness
that
i
like
in
a
good
tripel
the
spiciness
hold
throughout
the
taste
profile
of
this
beer
finishing
with
a
sharp
ginger
like
note
at
the
end
this
has
a
fairly
full
body
to
it
yet
still
remains
quite
dry
on
the
palate
mainly
i
think
because
of
the
yeasty
spiciness
as
i
mentioned
this
tastes
quite
yeasty
as
well
it
gives
it
a
sharp
yeast
bite
to
it
the
beer
has
a
light
tartness
to
it
that
plays
up
the
fruity
aspects
of
the
beer
mostly
i
get
notes
of
green
apple
but
there
are
notes
of
pear
and
a
bit
of
tart
plum
as
well
it
also
plays
up
the
ginger
note
that
is
found
in
this
beer
comments
maybe
i
missed
something
about
this
beer
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
as
great
as
the
rankings
appear
it
is
evident
that
this
is
a
highquality
brew
deep
in
complexity
and
warming
for
the
soul
this
may
be
a
beer
i
will
appreciate
more
as
my
palate
develops
that
is
my
gut
feeling
it
is
simply
one
of
the
finest
try
some
this
beer
is
fantastically
crafted
and
a
very
good
beer
ive
never
been
a
huge
tripel
fan
this
is
one
of
the
best
and
while
i
enjoyed
it
the
rochefort
8
in
the
fridge
is
more
to
my
liking
opinion
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
hands
down
quality
stuff
since
this
is
the
hallmark
of
the
style
i
hate
saying
that
i
like
another
one
better
but
i
think
that
i
prefer
the
st
bernardus
tripel
to
this
one
that
is
a
stretch
but
if
you
put
both
in
front
of
me
and
i
only
got
to
choose
one
i
would
recommend
this
beer
any
day
of
the
week
yumthis
is
a
delectable
tripel
without
question
my
favorite
to
date
i
could
sip
this
stuff
all
evening
if
the
bottle
wouldnt
run
out
an
ok
triple
but
i
had
expected
more
from
this
one
compared
to
its
little
brother
the
dubbel
worth
a
try
this
is
a
beer
i
will
try
again
from
another
source
and
see
if
it
has
a
bit
more
wow
factor
to
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
very
tall
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
in
segments
leaving
a
rocky
and
bubbly
lace
nose
is
sweet
bubblegum
and
spicy
yeasts
along
with
a
bit
of
lemon
grass
taste
begins
sweet
with
candied
sugar
and
a
touch
of
honey
along
with
some
tropical
fruit
there
are
some
yeasty
and
doughy
flavors
that
follow
and
some
of
the
warming
alcohol
is
noticeable
refreshing
and
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
bright
gold
beer
with
lots
of
head
and
carbonation
it
smells
like
white
wine
with
some
additional
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
musty
yeast
the
taste
starts
out
friuty
and
becomes
very
spicy
there
is
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
the
alcohol
is
not
real
obvious
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
drinkability
is
ok
im
hooked
mouthfeel
is
light
and
playful
and
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
overall
lovely
and
interesting
beer
is
the
intensely
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
very
easy
to
find
in
northwest
columbus
but
on
the
expensive
side
generally
45
per
bottle
even
so
very
good
and
i
will
not
hesitate
to
buy
more
if
i
ever
get
to
belgium
ill
try
to
taste
some
fresh
bottles
a
very
good
beer
but
i
do
not
think
i
got
a
completly
fresh
bottle
the
pour
was
very
good
and
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
have
ever
seen
with
its
excelent
head
color
and
champagne
like
bubbles
the
scent
was
hard
to
detect
at
first
but
then
the
tropical
frutiness
and
doughy
scents
came
through
and
were
very
nice
the
flavor
was
very
unique
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
the
flavor
was
quite
sweet
but
had
a
very
dry
off
putting
quality
to
it
that
made
me
think
i
got
a
bum
bottle
there
was
not
much
flavor
at
all
other
than
sweetness
and
dryness
in
the
finnish
i
will
have
to
try
another
bottle
for
sure
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
tart
tangy
spiced
sweet
dry
juicy
this
beer
does
it
all
and
so
well
extremely
glad
i
can
buy
this
locally
but
wishing
i
could
try
it
fresh
off
the
taps
in
belgium
deceptively
drinkable
no
alcohol
cringe
quite
complex
keep
count
though
11
2
oz
bottle
pours
a
really
nice
ample
head
into
a
duvel
glass
citrusy
fruity
hoppy
scents
a
really
sparkly
carbonated
mouthfeel
im
kind
of
new
to
tripels
but
this
is
really
something
im
going
to
explore
a
lot
more
if
theyre
like
this
one
the
flavors
are
complex
with
citrus
and
hops
going
along
with
the
spice
this
is
like
duvel
on
the
most
refined
gourmet
steroids
a
lot
more
interesting
to
taste
and
very
refreshing
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
content
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
i
only
had
one
but
ill
be
looking
for
more
this
was
a
nice
treat
overall
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
beyond
amazing
and
completely
worth
the
5
40
i
paid
for
the
small
bottle
i
saw
the
caged
and
corked
bigger
bottles
for
around
10
so
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
at
least
one
next
time
i
see
it
westmalle
tripel
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
ever
had
along
with
the
outstanding
de
dolle
dulle
teve
even
though
it
doesnt
taste
like
what
ive
always
thought
was
my
preferred
tripel
profile
fruitier
and
sweeter
its
still
more
than
impressive
and
is
compulsively
drinkable
bottom
line
this
tripel
is
a
home
run
this
beer
is
just
fantastic
i
am
used
to
tripels
that
are
a
little
more
clear
and
carbonated
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
it
those
monks
do
know
how
to
brew
a
devilishy
good
beer
and
it
shows
a
most
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
12
a
750ml
is
sufficient
33cl
bottle
not
quite
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
not
sure
if
this
sat
out
in
the
light
to
long
i
liked
the
dubbel
more
still
a
good
beer
cheers

there
are
better
a
great
tripel
that
is
worth
trying
and
enjoying
as
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
this
is
among
the
best
of
the

looks
peachy
and
coppery
highly

throughout
the
session
high
sweet
alcohol
combined
with
the
carbonation

numbing
and
playful
through
the
entire

finishes
dry

hot
leaving
mild

noble
varieties
this
is
a
very
complex
and
well
matured
handled
beer
im
sorry
that
i
have
passed
this
one
up
so
many
times
previously
medium
dark
translucent
orange
small
dissipating
head
and
not
much
lacing
smell
is
spicy
alcohol
like
im
about
to
taste
an
afterdinner
drink
taste
is
biting
for
a
tripel
hoppy
in
the
middle
of
a
wash
of
alcohol
and
spiced
fruit
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
tad
thin
leaving
an
oily
coating
which
contributes
to
a
long
finish
i
like
my
beers
to
show
their
alcohol
this
one
does
though
somewhat
harshly
still
ive
got
to
recommend
it
use
it
as
a
digestif
i
cant
believe
i
never
reviewed
this
one
before
a
recent
sample
on
my
road
trip
reawakened
me
to
how
good
this
stuff
really
is
important
note
must
be
consumed
as
fresh
as
possible
this
one
really
loses
its
lustre
with
age
big
time
anyways
fresh
bottle
sampled
somewhere
in
wisconsin
dark
golden
with
a
big
pillowy
head
of
white
foam
this
is
really
the
benchmark
look
for
this
style
of
brew
excellent
head
retention
fantastic
bruxelles

its
all
here
aromas
of
fresh
baked
belgian
bready

other
fruits
notes
spices
like
black
pepper
and
coriander
come
to
mind
as
well
and
round
out
the
fruity
yeastiness
of
this
brew
taste
is
fruity
and
sharp
totally
warming
with
just
a
small
hint
of
alcohol
the
heavily
fruity
taste
and
spiciness
blend
together
with
the
bready
malts
and
make
for
a
very
complex
beverage
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodiedthick
and
drinkability
remains
very
very
good
as
i
drink
more
and
more
beers
i
sometimes
forget
about
the
starter
beers
that
really
got
me
into
the
whole
good
beerbelgian
beer
scene
this
is
one
of
those
beers
and
it
is
as
good
today
as
it
was
back
than
as
i
said
before
just
watch
out
for
old
bottles
of
this
i
personally
think
westmalle
brews
do
not
age
too
well
and
should
be
consumed
as
fresh
as
possible
if
you
can
drink
it
over
in
belgium
even
better
i
think
i
have
seen
singles
for
as
cheap
as
about
1
20
in
many
belgian
super
markets

from

this

certainly
a

none

for
a
gentle
now
i
dont
like
funk
but
this
beer
i
actually
enjoyed
despite
my
dislike
for
funk
i
will
judge
this
beer
to
style
easily
my
favorite
of
the
brace
of
westmalles
so
much
better
when
fresh
in
my
opinion
i
wouldnt
even
bother
aging
these
finger
licking
good
its
amazing
how
fast
you
can
drink
this
one
even
though
its
9

what
danger
notes
this
looses

citrusy

drinkability
is
high
not
a
session
brew
due
to
the
abv
but
just
wonderful
god
i
love
belgians
overall
probably
the
best
tripel
ive
had
and
exceptional
beer
the
taste
is
of
earthy
bright
fruity
malt
the
hops
are
enough
to
make
this
a
clean
finishing
beer
the
sweetness
is
not
cloying
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
encountered
it
is
ultra
creamy
and
medium
bodied
i
have
somehow
put
this
beer
down
in
about
thirty
minutes
it
took
no
effort
i
most
definitely
want
another
one
good
beer
though
and
especially
nice
in
95
degree
weather
the
most
amazing
thing
about
this
ale
is
that
there
are
two
levels
working
here
there
is
a
wonderfully
fruitycitrus
spicy
hop
levelapparently
the
most
hopped
trappist
beverage
that
cascades
briliantly
above
a
lowerwarming
alcohol
level
this
creates
an
astoundingly
complex
beer
if
trappist
ales
are
all
famous
for
hiding
the
alcohol
content
to
some
degree
perhaps
westmalle
tripel
does
it
the
best
and
achieves
the
perfect
balance

the

raisin

very
faintest

for

5
the
beer
goes
down
amazingly
easily
drinkability
is
tremendous
much
lighter
and
crisper
than
some
of
the
other
sickly
sweet
tripels
out
there
a
hazy
golden
colour
the
generous
white
head
was
quickly
reduced
but
produced
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
spicy
aroma
doughy
malt
light
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
smells
pretty
nice
but
a
little
bit
muted
overall
good
combination
of
flavours
with
fruit
cloves
and
moderate
sweetness
balancing
a
drying
bitterness
short
finish
that
is
a
little
sweet
with
light
peppery
spice
and
alcohol
warmth
medium
body
moderately
high
carbonation
produce
an
initially
light
airy
texture
the
unique
cloudy
golden
appearance
is
a
site
to
behold
creating
a
sense
of
anticipation
of
whats
to
come
the
smell
is
something
special
indeed
a
great
mix
of
of
caramel
sweetness
that
i
found
myself
lingering
over
for
quite
some
time
the
rich
flavor
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
floral
overtones
highly
recommended
ah
well
the
triple
has
an
orangish
color
cloudly
very
carbonated
the
head
came
and
dissapeared
quickly
her
smell
is
very
fruity
with
shy
notes
of
hops
and
malt
taste
is
spicy
alcoholic
esthylic
and
carbonated
actually
way
too
much
carbonated
it
was
like
i
had
a
westmalle
that
when
diving
too
deep
and
went
up
too
fast
bubbles
in
my
mouth
that
didnt
feel
right
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
brew
worth
checking
out
again
this
beer
pours
a
nice
hazy
peach
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
liquid
the
nose
is
raisiney
caramel
and
spicey
i
can
pick
up
the
candied
sugar
that
was
used
for
certain
the
flavor
is
pretty
nice
as
well
the
raisin
is
not
so
sweet
as
the
nose
says
there
is
a
little
more
graineyness
as
well
the
alcohol
plays
nice
and
spicey
as
well
not
bad
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
moderate
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
apparent
rendering
the
drinkability
a
bit
less
than
it
could
be
overall
i
like
it
but
i
can
think
of
other
brews
i
would
have
before
this
one
drinkability
very
nice
has
a
pleasant
bite
on
the
finish
one
of
the
better
tripels
out
there
with
great
availability
i
had
this
at
a
bar
in
pa
in
a
chimay
chalice
allowing
for
a
nice
presentation
served
a
bit
too
cold
this
is
definitely
better
when
allowed
to
warm
and
breathe
a
little
the
smell
is
of
soft
bready
malts
tinged
with
a
nice
banana
sweetness
and
other
carmelized
sugar
notes
the
fruity
esters
are
clean
and
pleasingly
sweet
never
cloying
the
9
5
is
not
surprising
though
well
suited
to
the
malt
profile
and
slight
bitterness
of
the
hops
this
remains
an
immensely
drinkable
beer
at
that
high
abv
this
is
a
good
benchmark
for
tripels
to
go
by
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
silky
feel
on
the
palate
this
beer
drinks
way
too
smoothly
for
its
high
abv
i
could
easily
polish
off
several
of
these
and
get
multiple
frowns
from
the
wife
if
i
did
so
this
is
one
of
the
newly
distributed
750
ml
bottles
good
move
that
pours
hazy
yellow
orange
with
a
huge
pillowy
white
head
this
is
what
beer
should
look
like
lots
of
bubbles
and
the
head
will
not
die
smells
very
vinous
off
the
pour
grapy
and
spicy
some
spicy
hops
and
lots
of
esters
yeasty
grassy
and
somewhat
musty
tastes
of
noble
hops
up
front
becoming
more
grassy
and
grainy
as
more
malt
profile
comes
through
lots
of
yeasty
banana
orange
peel
notes
along
with
fruity
esters
and
a
bit
of
a
sour
vinous
quality
not
a
whole
lot
of
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
well
blended
into
the
flavor
very
inconspicuous
light
and
foamy
on
the
tongue
dry
and
a
lingering
sourness
at
the
finish
not
a
bad
offering
kind
of
pricey
poured
out
to
a
cloudy
tarnished
golden
colour
with
high
carbonation
well
formed
head
remained
consistant
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
of
fruits
and
light
sugars
were
most
noted
as
was
alcohol
being
as
it
has
a
rather
high
abv
very
good
mouthfeel
with
a
smoothness
that
was
crisp
and
direct
with
the
carbonation
making
tastebuds
come
alive
and
pay
attention
flavor
was
quite
spicy
with
a
strong
complexity
of
pears
bananas
and
grapefruit
very
complex
beer
finished
well
with
a
sourlike
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
as
far
as
tripels
go
this
is
probably
the
best
i
have
had
recommended
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
sharing
this
wonderful
selection
overall
this
beer
is
great
although
i
am
limited
in
my
experiance
with
trappists
i
can
tell
this
is
one
of
the
more
superior
brews
of
the
exclusive
group
as
the
beer
warmed
in
the
glass
the
musty
fruity
taste
became
more
apparent
and
aroma
more
pronounced
thought
that
it
might
turn
me
away
from
my
prefered
trapp
roche
10
but
did
not
still
a
very
alluring
and
complex
beer
that
i
will
definitely
enjoy
whenever
available
mouthfeel
was
creamy
a
pretty
good
tripel
all
round
a
good
beer
definitely
reccommend
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
gold
with
a
nice
1
inch
head
aroma
is
wonderful
and
complex
with
hints
of
yeast
sweet
fruit
sweet
candy
sugar
spiceness
and
alcohol
in
fact
this
is
the
best
smelling
beer
ive
ever
hadspent
a
good
5
minutes
just
sniffing
before
a
taste
and
what
a
taste
it
was
first
impression
is
very
fruity
pineapple
and
pears
come
to
mind
then
i
start
to
get
a
spicey
yeast
taste
finish
is
a
little
tart
and
just
slightly
hoppy
a
little
alcohol
taste
creeps
in
towards
the
last
third
of
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
heavy
side
with
an
amazingly
smooth
and
creamy
feel
this
is
an
excellent
beer
but
because
the
price
6bottle
and
the
fact
that
the
spiciness
really
asserts
itself
towards
the
end
will
keep
me
from
drinking
this
more
than
as
the
occassional
treat
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
mediumheavy
light
on
the
palate
finish
leaves
the
mouth
clean
and
refreshed
very
wellrounded
and
textured
extraordinarily
drinkable
for
a
tripel
them
monks
sure
know
how
to
brew
thanks
to
futaboots
for
this
one
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
bitch
all
night
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
1
12
white
head
yeasty
nose
with
some
malt
and
spice
taste
of
orange
clove
nutmeg
heavy
alcohol
and
some
hops
balance
it
out
at
the
end
heavy
bodied
rich
mouthfeel
very
warming
end
this
is
a
heavy
duty
trappist
ale
i
hope
there
is
still
plenty
around
next
winter
it
would
make
an
excellent
winter
nightcap
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
color
with
some
unidentified
floating
objects
hanging
around
in
the
glass
the
head
is
out
of
control
tightly
knit
white
head
is
trying
to
get
out
of
my
glass
really
outstanding
looking
malty
sweet
aroma
intensified
by
fruit
along
with
some
spice
lemony
notes
and
alcohol
flavor
is
very
smooth
lots
of
creamy
malt
forms
a
canvas
upon
which
fresh
fruit
spices
and
alcohol
paint
a
beautiful
picture
of
flavor
there
is
more
to
the
flavor
going
on
that
i
can
accurately
describe
very
complex
alcohol
is
pretty
warming
in
the
stomach
but
is
not
very
noticeable
in
the
taste
at
all
great
blend
of
bittering
hops
and
sweet
flavors
low
carbonation
embellishes
the
very
smooth
very
full
mouthfeel
definitely
a
kickass
beer
i
really
want
to
cellar
some
of
this
stuff
and
see
how
it
changes
although
it
is
damn
good
as
is
overall
impression
wow
a
touch
spicy
for
any
session
which
is
good
given
the
expertly
hidden
alcohol
just
a
wonderful
fruity
beer
that
has
redefined
what
a
tripel
can
be
mad
props
to
stonecrusher
for
the
trade
drinkability
i
have
to
shave
a
half
off
for
its
9
abv
and
4
50
price
tag
but
if
i
were
bill
gates
id
have
a
walkin
fridge
full
of
it
i
could
literally
drink
only
this
forever
and
be
happy
imho
certainly
the
best
tripel
and
one
of
the
best
beers
this
mortal
coil
has
to
offer
divine
inspiration
indeed
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
look
for
this
again
a
great
beer
none
the
less
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
a
clovelike
spiciness
ends
with
a
dry
stinging
bite
very
tasty
and
warming
excellent
as
a
nightcap
although
im
drinking
mine
at
9
in
the
morning

quite

here
we
go

the

slightly

no

at
all
at

and
my
heart
sank
then
all
of
a
sudden
whosh
there
is
was
nothing
to
1

of
thick

in
a
flash
this
is
a
good
sign

intoxicating

ill
take
this
to
that
desserted
island
and
be
satisfied
beer
wise
for
a
long
time
a
fine
tripel
drinkbaility
and
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
dissapointed
beers
ive
had
lately
maybe
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
but
nothing
about
it
really
tasted
good
its
pretty
and
smells
nice
but
goes
downhill
from
there
not
one
id
really
like
to
have
again
flavor
is
spicy
with
some
floral
hop
and
some
citrus
zest
in
the
finish
thanks
to
gabe
for
sharing
this
treat
came
in
a
33cl
bottle
with
best
before
date

i
have
been
hearing
nothing
but
great
things
about
this
beer
for
some
time
now
so
i
decided
to
check
it
out
to
see
what
all
the
hype
is
all
about
and
now
i
can
definately
see
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
with
so
many
different
layers
and
characteristics
to
it
not
too
bitter
in
taste
considering
its
strength
95
which
doesnt
taste
like
it
at
all
so
its
very
masked
indeed
gave
a
very
nice
bittersweet
aftertaste
though
i
believe
with
a
little
cellaring
would
do
this
beer
great
things
that
is
if
i
can
keep
my
hands
off
of
it
extremely
complex
triple
that
totally
lives
up
to
the
trappist
name
highly
recommended
to
all
i
say
this
brew
is
a
hazy
lighterorange
color
sizable
frothy
white
head
lots
of
little
bubbles
rushing
to
the
top
fair
amount
of
lace
flaky
chunks
after
the
second
pour
sweet
candy
nose
some
hints
of
lemon
active
feel
on
the
tounge
light
and
fruity
sweet
malts
hops
active
hint
of
alcohol
but
it
is
well
blended
dry
finish
quite
a
nice
brew
well
worth
a
try
mmm
is
it
better
than
tripel
karmelit
probably
would
i
buy
it
again
definatly
this
is
a
genre
defining
beer
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
tripel
should
be
this
is
it
beer
is
good
happy
tripel
beering
this
is
a
first
for
me
i
love
tripels
and
the
other
trappist
beers
ive
tried
have
been
top
notch
there
are
some
balance
issues
for
me
with
this
brew
way
too
much
of
a
booze
vibe
going
on
for
5
for
a
single
11
2
oz
bottle
this
wasnt
near
as
good
as
it
should
have
been
unless
youre
just
dying
to
drink
really
expensive
boozy
beer
drinkability

champagnelike
burps
are
emitted
the
crispness
knocks
back
the
drinkability
a
bit
feels
very
carbonated
on
the
tongue
lots
of
bubbly
action
which
lends
to
a
dry
finish
at
9
5
it
even
leaves
me
craving
for
more
i
love
the
westmalle
tripel
a
true
classic
poured
a
wonderfullooking
cloudy
grapefruit
juice
in
color
but
its
not
about
the
color
its
about
the
pillowy
immensely
thick
longlasting
glasscoating
lipsaturating
i
picture
an
ad
in
a
beer
magazine
with
someone
drinking
a
glass
of
this
with
a
thick
moustache
of
head
asking
got
westmalle
head
that
sits
atop
the
beer
dare
i
say
breathtaking
aromas
are
quite
yeasty
mixed
with
orange
peels
bubble
gum
a
can
of
pineapple
juice
and
a
dash
of
earthy
funk
what
was
more
surprising
for
me
was
how
different
the
taste
was
from
the
smell
there
was
a
pervasive
perfume
flavor
to
this
beer
not
overpowering
or
unpleasant
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
a
very
distinct
flavor
that
mixes
with
the
other
flavors
fruit
juices
peppery
spice
malty
sweetness
finishes
on
the
dry
side
with
a
dose
of
bitter
hoppiness
arriving
on
the
scene
abv
is
up
there
at
9
5
but
is
cloaked
nicely
by
the
rest
of
whats
going
on
here
not
as
thick
or
chewy
as
expected
not
as
good
as
other
tripels
ive
had
but
its
very
good
overall
very
nice
getting
a
bit
up
there
in
the
price
to
taste
ratio
but
still
worthwhile
tasted
of
crisp
pears
sour
apples
and
sweet
bananas
up
front
prickly
on
the
tongue
and
extremely
smooth
on
the
tongue
finish
is
bitter
drying
and
consumes
the
entire
mouth
interestingly
enough
this
tripels
is
more
dry
than
sweet
its
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
even
with
the
high
abv
its
hard
to
control
yourself
while
drinking
good
stuff
the
taste
is
subtle
malts
oranges
bread
dough
spices
an
herbal
bitter
finish
that
i
want
to
call
peppery
but
that
would
be
too
specific
all
with
a
juicy
and
concentrated
mouthfeel
its
fabulous
how
do
they
do
this
everything
is
perfect
me
best
triple
ever
pretty
fresh
and
complex
even
good
on
a
hot
aussie
summer
day
im
getting
more
much
more
only
problem
its
drinkability
heightens
majorly
in
the
colder
weather
goes
really
well
with
pine
nuts
an
excellent
and
wellbalanced
triple
one
of
the
best
out
there
the
dryness
causes
the
drinkability
to
suffer
but
i
could
see
this
as
a
wonderful
brew
to
sip
with
a
broiled
chicken
or
pheasant
hugely
complex
flavor
apricots
come
to
mind
but
that
is
only
the
beginning
its
winelike
in
its
dryness
seems
to
reduce
the
drinkability
a
bit
for
me
but
i
cant
seem
to
set
this
drink
down
stellar
good
stuff
glad
i
found
it
ever
elusive
these
beers
are
have
fun
drinking
it
i
know
you
will
i
dont
need
to
recommend
this
to
you
i
will
anyways
though
a
solid
tripel
all
the
way
hits
some
high
spicy
notes
but
it
well
balanced
with
loads
of
tropical
fruits
its
hard
to
drink
as
i
know
it
will
be
gone
too
soon
easily
one
of
the
best
belgians
ive
had
very
very
good
this
beer
is
very
much
like
a
good
wine
wonderful
color
and
a
very
pleasant
smell
very
smooth
taste
almost
like
a
hefe
surprisingly
potent
its
a
tough
one
to
find
especially
when
you
live
in
the
florida
panhandle
read
budmiller
country
but
this
one
is
worth
searching
out
i
wish
i
had
another
by
the
time
i
finished
the
glass
i
felt
like
i
had
just
drank
a
few
glasses
of
wine
which
is
somewhat
different
than
i
usually
feel
after
putting
back
a
few
tasty
brews
this
is
quite
interesting
and
in
a
good
way
the
drinkability
is
very
high
in
the
do
i
want
another
factor
but
in
the
could
i
handle
another
i
would
say
no
for
the
time
being
lest
i
wake
up
with
a
hangover
or
spoil
the
perfect
buzz
leftover
from
such
a
wonderful
brew
first
off
this
beer
has
easily
the
largest
head
ive
ever
seen
on
a
beer
big
white
fluffy
foam
good
retention
some
lacing
too
cloudy
deep
gold
body
with
lots
of
bubbles
i
like
the
aroma
very
sweet
but
a
light
sweetness
i
hint
of
floral
hops
hiding
in
there
too
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
a
little
too
much
it
has
a
very
dry
finish
that
actually
leaves
me
thirsty
doesnt
taste
as
sweet
as
it
smells
this
beer
is
very
very
good
and
adding
the
final
13
bottle
and
subsequent
yeast
only
made
it
that
much
better
definitely
the
best
bottled
tripel
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
consuming
a
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
slight
haze
has
an
enormous
bright
white
head
there
is
astrong
sweet
and
spicey
aroma
the
sweetness
hints
at
fruit
and
candy
the
spiceyness
is
a
good
robust
hop
invitation
the
flavor
has
a
soft
fruit
sweetness
to
it
carried
along
by
a
prickley
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
nice
spicey
hop
finish
if
you
pour
it
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
you
will
get
a
much
more
cloudy
appearance
the
alcohol
does
not
have
a
strong
presence
in
the
flavor
but
does
make
its
self
apparent
in
a
warm
glow
in
your
stomach
about
half
the
way
through
the
bottle
pours
out
to
a
bright
gold
in
the
glass
with
an
explosively
large
head
quite
a
bit
of
cloudiness
follows
the
initial
pour
the
aroma
reminds
me
a
bit
of
bourbon
the
taste
is
very
good
and
maintains
a
slightly
spicy
peppery
beligian
profile
as
the
beer
warmed
the
abv
seemed
to
come
out
more
this
beer
definetely
needs
its
happy
place
temperaturewise
too
cold
or
too
warm
detract
from
its
quality
so
this
is
what
those
monks
spend
all
their
time
on
not
a
bad
line
of
work
if
you
can
find
it
myself
i
would
need
time
to
get
accustomed
to
a
beer
like
this
it
doesnt
make
any
appologies
for
being
as
strong
as
it
is
and
possibly
because
of
its
youth
came
off
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
this
first
thing
i
noticed
right
away
with
this
one
was
a
monstrous
banana
smell
there
may
very
well
be
bananas
in
this
one
a
bit
of
cloves
cloudy
yellow
orange
in
colour
thin
fizzy
head
than
hangs
around
for
a
bit
par
for
the
course
with
belgians
you
know
the
drill
as
much
as
it
pains
me
to
say
so
this
stuff
really
has
a
bitterness
to
it
that
i
just
totally
do
not
care
for
very
disappointed
indeed
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
for
quite
some
time
now
the
texture
or
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
smooth
and
just
heavy
enough
for
the
style
again
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
is
going
on
with
the
taste
but
it
seems
offensively
bitter
i
am
however
just
now
getting
over
a
sickness
that
has
incapacitated
me
for
last
four
days
or
so
perhaps
my
sense
of
smell
and
taste
are
still
a
bit
impaired
i
certainly
hope
so
i
should
rereview
this
in
about
a
week
or
so
until
then
tonights
review
stands
drinkability
a
must
sip
brew
this
is
one
global
great
to
be
savored
i
appreciate
the
yeastiness
to
this
beer
above
all
of
the
wonderful
characteristics
and
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
bottleconditioned
makes
it
quite
evident
and
appealing
outstanding
this
is
a
nice
sweet
and
fruity
tripel
that
doesnt
hold
back
nice
presentation
nose
and
color
it
scores
high
in
my
style
points
though
i
did
give
slightly
lower
marks
on
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
yes
i
expected
to
find
the
alcohol
on
the
nose
and
palette
fairly
quickly
it
is
9
5
abv
after
all
but
i
felt
that
in
combination
with
what
i
perceived
to
be
a
little
too
much
carbonation
at
times
those
two
categories
couldnt
break
the
4
0
mark
that
said
its
still
a
fantastic
beer
however
i
prefer
others
in
the
same
style
such
as
st
bernardus
abt
12
pater
lieven
tripel
etc
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
gravity
ale
the
smell
brings
alcohol
and
esters
the
taste
adds
citrus
and
fairly
light
malt
malts
take
over
then
alcohol
and
hops
take
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
bright
and
unique
the
drinkability
is
outright
dangerous

no
excessive
dryness
or
must
feel
in

there
is
some
citrus
akin

this
beer
is
not
as
alcoholic
as
expected
for
a
9
5
indeed
there
is
little
alcohol
in
the
taste
only
asserting
itself
by
a
warmth
on
the
tongue
this
is
perfectly
balanced
betwixt
the
malt
sugar
and
yeast
what
really
impressed
me
was
the
mouthfeel
which
was
delectably
creamy
this
beer
hits
the
tongue
and
becomes
creamy
like
icecream
exceptionally
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
this
certainly
does
not
suggest
9

alcohol
which
means
drinkability

you
will
find

tastes

aromas
every
time
you
lift
the

as

as
it
is
it
is
quite
approachable
for
a
trappist
tripel
perfect
with
sharp
cheese
or
pasta
overall
a
great
great
brew
would
be
a
5
0
if
the
alcohol
wasnt
so
prevalent
the
first
sip
of
the
beer
yields
very
a
yeasty
dry
taste
with
an
aftertaste
of
a
slight
lemon
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
nice
by
now
the
head
is
a
very
thin
layer
with
light
lacing
still
left
on
the
glass
and
the
alcohol
is
little
more
apparent
as
it
warms
the
aftertaste
last
for
a
while
with
a
nice
hoppy
dry
feel
this
is
a
very
drinkable

tripels
this

boozy

me

favorite
belgian
breweries
high

nice

smells
like

caramel
and

it
has
some
noticeable

aroma
they
dont
hide
the
strong
taste
of
alcohol
at
room
temp
the
alcohol
is
even
more
noticeable
and
with
a
flat
head
i
still
prefer
the
rouge
and
the
cuvee
the
chateau
but
its
what
id
like
a
tripel
to
be
o
this
beer
in
veryvery
unique
its
unlike
an
triple
that
ive
ever
had
more
than
thatits
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
the
honey
notescombined
with
the
spicy
finishare
odd
but
weirdly
do
work
i
would
suggest
pairing
this
beer
with
some
like
a
chinese
honey
chilli
chicken
some
sort
of
sweet
and
sour
dish
i
give
this
beer
a
4
overall
for
being
a
very
enjoyable
and
unique
experience
a
must
try
for
belgian
beer
geeks
like
myself
overall
4
0
the
most
unusual
triple
i
have
ever
tasted
i
would
dare
anyone
to
try
this
beer
blindfolded
and
tell
me
it
is
actually
a
beer
everything
that
makes
a
beer
a
beer
is
gone
from
this
brews
flavor
profile
no
malt
and
no
hops
still
what
is
here
is
like
alchemy
lead
into
gold
a
brief
foray
into
the
magical
this
beer
is
strange
it
grows
on
you
and
if
you
are
a
homebrewer
like
me
you
wonder
what
kind
of
yeast
cleared
this
out
of
sugars
like
this
what
kind
of
wood
is
that
i
taste
not
the
best
triple
i
have
ever
had
but
surely
the
most
interesting
and
challenging
to
the
style
recommended
o
good
drinkability
classic
belgian
tripel
good
pours
a
clear

drip

is
much
the
same
with
honey
spice
fruit
and
slight
cardboard
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
oxidized
qualities
that
actually
dont
really
detract
from
the
other
aromas
and
flavors
its
a
power
house
that
ought
to
be
tasted
against
the
best
trappists

bit
strange
and
a

and
surprisingly
crisp
sipping
for
the
abv
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
overall
pretty
solid
tripel
but
tasted
really
sweet
everything
else
was
spot
on
not
the
most
complex
of
tripels
but
still
average
and
i
felt
that
this
beer
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
if
it
had
more
body
or
flavors
not
sugar
to
conceal
its
petro
that
said
it
is
still
a
good
beer
that
fits
this
cold
day
o
this
is
a
very
fruit
tripel
dominated
by
something
more
like
sour
apple
than
the
typical
citrus
well
balanced
overall
and
is
is
a
nice
change
from
the
typical
tripels
overall
nice
tripel
glad
i
tried
it
not
wowed
o
this
bottle
had
no
or
signs
of
infection
or
major
issues
so
im
reviewing
the
beer
for
what
i
had
which
was
still
decently
enjoyable
but
mediocre
and
lacking
complexity
it
seemed
to
me
like
they
were
trying
to
bolster
things
up
by
just
raising
abv
o
theres
no
mistaking
the
strength
of
this
beer
given
the
notes
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
a
beer
i
used
to
love
but
my
palate
has
changed
and
i
have
tasted
so
many
epic
tripels
now
one
of
the
first
of
the
style
i
ever
enjoyed
that
was
a
younger
me
this
beer
actually
exceeded
my
expectations
perhaps
i
feared
the
booziness
of
the
big
bottle
and
refrained
from
revisiting
it
over
the
past
few
years
its
been
at
least
that
long
since
ive
last
had
one
and
guess
what
id
go
after
another
one
sooner
than
later
i
guess
it
just
still
sticks
with
me
overall
im
pleased
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
d
a
delicious
tripel
with
a
modicum
of
ethanol
power
good
stuff
pretty
much
by
the
book
tripel
it
looks
and
tastes
good
but
it
does
not
excite
at
11abv
it
should
have
some
kick
in
the
rear
besides
alcohol
compared
to
belgians
it
is
an
also
ran
good
but
not
great
and
certainly
short
on
body
head
flavor
and
smell
for
my
money
id
invest
a
few
cents
more
and
buy
a
better
experience
than
this
rather
bland
offering
from
van
honsebrouck
overall
the
beer
is
a
nice
mix
of
freshness
and
dryness
however
the
fruit
taste
doesnt
last
that
long
and
gets
way
to
quicky
overwhelmed
by
the
dry
tast
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
kasteel
makes
pretty
good
beers
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
grain
sugar
fruit
banana
spice
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
sugar
alcohol
grain
banana
and
spice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
upon
first
inspection
of
the
aroma
on
this
one
it
was
pretty
close
to
what
one
would
expect
from
the
style
as
far
as
the
notes
given
off
throughout
once
i
took
the
first
sip
i
was
really
offput
by
the
alcohol
note
going
on
in
this
one
as
it
was
very
distracting
from
the
other
flavors
going
on
in
this
one
there
was
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
going
on
despite
this
fact
but
the
alcohol
just
dulled
it
down
for
me
personally
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
especially
on
tap
o
nice
crispiness
fruit
flavors
really
open
up
at
near
room
temp
alot
of
alcohol
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
again
11
i
think
ill
start
this
at
room
temp
the
next
time
i
open
one
this
is
to
triples
what
devil
dancer
is
to
iipas
this
will
forever
be
in
my
rotation
i
love
high
octane
brews
on
occasion
its
a
very
manly
beer
and
not
everyone
is
going
to
like
it
its
not
something
i
want
to
dry
again
for
a
long
time
as
there
are
plenty
of
other
triples
out
there
to
try
thick
on
the
body
but
only
average
carbonation
is
also
average
actually
a
good
value
for
8
50
not
as
complex
as
i
prefer
nor
the
dark
fruit
undertones
i
love
but
very
farmhouse
ale
that
tastes
like
7abv
but
it
is
actually
11
pours
a
light
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
lightly
of
apples
taste
is
a
sweet
caramel
finishing
with
some
ethanol
mouthfeel
is
rich
low
carbonation
overall
a
good
triple
however
it
is
a
bit
higher
in
alcohol
than
i
typically
like
such
an
extreme
triple
with
bold
aroma
flavor
body
yet
also
alcohol
lurking
the
flavor
of
this
brew
to
me
is
lacking
just
tastes
like
a
high
alcohol
brew
instead
of
a
true
tripel
overall
a
nice
beer
nothing
really
exciting
but
good
drinkable
it
looks
great
has
most
of
the
style
characteristics
and
serves
my
needs
in
the
triple
field
o
a
lovely
beer
very
clean
and
sweet
good
spices
strong
alcohol
flavor
but
no
heat
would
drink
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
seems
incomplete
and
could
possibly
better
with
age
mine
was
about
13
months
old
from
bottling
when
tried
o
a
good
solid
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
altough
a
rather
heavy
one
o
as
with
my
rouge
the
bottle
was
very
old
over
18
months
in
this
case
still
you
have
to
expect
a
tripel
to
hold
up
to
18
months
and
i
didnt
sense
anything
off
about
it
just
wasnt
good
maybe
the
year
and
a
half
took
off
some
flavor
o
a
good
triple
but
it
a
treat
2
have
one
now
again
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
w
a
nice
one
finger
white
head
super
transparent
this
could
almost
pass
for
a
lighter
beer
in
appearance
nose
is
that
of
apple
honey
grape
grain
somewhat
sweet
on
the
smell
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
nose
with
fruit
sweetness
and
malt
really
coming
through
feel
is
medium
with
sweetness
malt
and
alcohol
burn
all
competing
for
the
top
character
overall
this
is
a
good
tripel
just
not
a
great
one
the
good
news
is
that
its
priced
well
and
readily
available
around
washington
dc
a
good
solid
beer
and
one
im
glad
i
tried
on
draft
i
could
drink
it
all
day
except
that
11
would
knock
me
out
overall
this
a
very
nice
enjoyable
triple
o
a
solid
tripel
with
a
strong
earthly
alcohol
kick
the
fragrance
is
sweet
rich
in
sugars
and
there
sees
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
flavor
is
mostly
sweet
alcoholic
and
without
that
beer
lacks
balance
at
the
tasting
it
is
quite
creamy
round
palate
and
easy
if
not
pleasant
to
drink
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
is
much
more
pleasant
in
the
mouth

the

the
first
tripels
i
would
select
but
its
still
a
decent
beer
though
not
the
quentessential
tripel
ale
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
merrit
because
of
its
malty
sweet
and
succulent
flavors
moderate
alcohol
impact
and
lightly
syrupy
feel
making
it
more
akin
to
a
complement
to
a
fruity
desert
or
as
a
stand
alone
digestive
im
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
it
has
a
great
aroma
but
when
poured
into
a
glass
there
are
chunks
of
hops
or
yeast
floating
in
the
glass
i
actually
thought
i
poured
it
into
a
dirty
glass
and
had
to
get
a
new
glass
which
was
crystal
clear
and
the
same
thing
happened
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
was
a
buildup
of
some
sort
of
sediment
the
beer
left
a
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
as
it
is
way
too
sweet
there
was
an
average
amount
of
lace
and
head
overall
a
way
overpriced
and
unsatisfying
brew
o
definitely
not
the
best
triple
but
is
very
very
unique
and
worthy
of
purchase
again
unbalanced
but
tolerable
drop
not
entirely
sure
how
long
these
bad
boys
last
it
says
bottled
on
091201
i
assume
thats
december
1st
2009
haha
i
hope
so
better
not
be
september
12
2001
overall
not
bad
actually
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
at
first
but
it
turned
out
ok
the
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
and
not
felt
at
all
worth
checking
out
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
triple
it
isnt
over
the
top
drinks
easy
and
it
packs
a
punch
at
11
it
is
thoroughly
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
am
always
looking
for
beers
to
share
with
my
lady
who
tends
to
like
tripels
and
for
10
bucks
for
a
750
bottle
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
a
good
buy
and
a
good
drink
overall
its
not
bad
not
sure
i
will
get
it
again
too
many
other
beers
to
try
if
it
was
cheap
that
would
be
another
story

d
i
must
say
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
and
probably
kasteel
in
general
this
is
the
second
of
their
beers
that
ive
had
tonight
and
both
have
been
pretty
underwhelming
this
was
a
pricey
brew
especially
given
the
price
tag
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
sized
white
fizzy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
had
poor
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
grain
malts
a
light
herbal
hop
and
a
cobweb
scented
yeast
with
notes
of
citrus
and
honey
the
initial
flavor
was
slightly
sour
and
acidic
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
finished
with
a
bitter
yeast
flavor
that
had
a
hint
of
citrus
and
a
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
that
lasted
a
little
while
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
mild
in
body
with
a
watery
texture
overall
a
surprisingly
refreshing
brew
that
is
a
little
to
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
alcohol
content
a
hefty
and
unique
tripel
decent

drinkability
pretty
good
do
not
notice
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
just
the
spinning
of
the
head
nice
overall
easy
to
drink
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
not
the
best
but
a
reasonable
example
and
worth
drinking
again
very
clear
appearance
light
slightly
yellow

color
dense
cream

head
at
pour
settles
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
edge
and
some
fine
cover
to
the
face
of
the
beer
bright
bready
aroma
seems
like
there
might
be
some
spice
to
the
beer
but
definitely
pick
up
the
orange
and
other
citris
notes
highly
carbonated
body
seems
medium
to
slightly
heavy
with
the
alcohol
and
yeastybreadiness
of
the
this
one
pick
up
more
of
the
citris
notes
towards
the
end
of
a
drink
and
on
the
finish
dryness
of
alcohol
becomes
slightly
greater
with
warmth
hasa
decent
mouthfeel
but
dryness
on
end
limits
the
drinkability
of
this
one
finish
doesnt
stay
too
long
but
just
enough
to
remember
if
you
want
a
real
powerhouse
this
heres
your
dog
kasteel
tripel
definitely
deserves
wider
recognition
and
madder
props
than
it
gets
try
a
bottle
out
on
some
friends
and
see
what
happens
id
have
another
but
i
know
for
sure
ive
had
much
better
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
slightly
murky
pale
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
tart
lemon
and
sweet
fruits
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
fruits
with
a
great
spice
kick
of
coriander
and
pepper
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
just
slight
alcohol
presence
this
is
a
great
draft
belgian
beer
id
love
to
see
it
ontap
more
often
this
review
was
taken
before
i
hit
the
normandie
camembert
very
ripe
and
crackers
garlic
and
herb
flavoured
however
the
second
half
of
beer
went
very
well
with
food
and
they
complimented
each
other
perfectly
drinkabililty
although
the
flavors
are
on
target
the
mouthfeel
and
the
heat
just
dont
cut
it
for
me
so
this
would
not
rank
among
the
better
tripels
i
have
encountered
wow
for
something
that
is
so
high
in
alcohol
it
was
quite
refreshing
and
perfect
with
korean
food
the
pour
show
a
meek
head
but
it
has
a
continue
supply
of
bubbles
to
replenish
golden
clear
with
a
finger
of
small
white
head
nose
is
ester
rich
port
wine
pineapple
and
lemon
zest
palate
is
smooth
with
a
nice
carbonation
that
broadens
a
very
crisp
take
on
something
quite
simple
pollen
belgian
yeast
citrus
mild
fruit
ester
blending
with
malt
and
sugars
not
too
much
of
any
one
type
of
effect
very
lean

well
placed
abv
d
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
it
has
a
good
taste
decently
drinkable
for
being
11
its
worth
a
try
sometime
drinkability
this
beer
does
some
things
really
well
and
some
not
so
well
all
in
all
its
ok
the
toohigh
alcohol
is
one
of
the
main
problems
in
that
it
makes
it
too
hot
tasting
and
probably
hurts
head
retention
and
lace
there
are
better
tripels
a
solid
beer
kasteel
makes
a
rather
light
tripel
that
is
both
refreshing
and
unique
while
certainly
not
the
best
tripel
on
the
market
it
is
unique
d
smooth
and
easy
going
with
11
well
hidden
dgreat
balance
on
this
beer
everything
you
want
to
see
in
a
triple
and
integrates
the
huge
abv
in
with
full
flavors
masking
the
true
power
of
this
tasty
treat
ddisturbingly
easy
to
drink
for
an
11
beer
this
ones
been
in
my
fridge
for
two
months
and
the
high
temperatures
have
slightly
abated
allowing
for
a
my
first
heavy
beer
in
a
while
poured
into
a
kasteel
chalice
a
lighter
color
with
a
white
head
that
disapated
quite
quickly
it
has
the
aroma
of
alcohol
and
sweetness
it
tastes
just
the
same
huge
alcohol
presence
and
a
candied
sugar
burn
it
is
a
nice
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
too
big
and
sweet
for
me
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
not
bad
d
this
was
a
very
nice
tripel
that
was
very
clean
and
tasty
the
body
was
good
not
great
but
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
so
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
more
like
champagne
than
beer
but
i
liked
it
not
sure
if
age
would
help
this
was
nearly
a
year
already
drinkability
very
drinkable
alc
level
extremely
hidden
with
a
very
great
balance
just
be
careful
this
hits
you
hard
but
its
very
enjoyable
will
try
again
for
sure
light
yet
full
bodied
unbelievably
drinkable
given
the
weighty
abv
this
is
a
sipper
to
be
savored
one
of
the
quintessential
examples
of
the
style
taste
is
very
nice
with
pears
and
belgian
hops
a
hint
of
malt
in
the
finish
very
nice
medium
mouth
feel
with
bubbles
way
easy
to
drink
i
cant
believe
it
is
11
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
tripel
so
far
i
prefer
it
to
both
fin
du
monde
and
westmalle
tit
has
a
celery
taste
mixed
with
caramel
its
got
a
strong
alcohol
undertone
to
it
its
quality
though
not
in
love
with
d
a
good
tripel
but
the
pungent
alcohol
quality
makes
this
beer
a
slow
sipper
d
overall
kasteel
tripel
is
a
pretty
decent
tripel
that
is
worth
trying
da
bit
sweet
to
drink
a
bunch
of
11
alcohol
is
hidden
well
dry
this
beer
out
or
up
the
hop
bitterness
too
bad
the
flavor
is
lacking
overall
its
not
bad
but
certainly
not
one
of
the
best
this
is
usually
a
style
i
think
goes
great
on
a
day
like
today
a
warm
sunny
spring
day
but
today
its
almost
too
much
a
slow
sipper
indeed
considering
the
strength
of
the
alcohol
this
beer
felt
a
lot
lighter
than
it
really
is
and
i
had
to
hold
back
from
drinking
this
faster
a
very
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
have
again
d
surprisingly
light
and
composed
easy
and
dangerous
if
drunk
too
quickly
d
very
tasty
tripel
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
much
more
malty
than
expected
but
the
fruityness
is
very
pleasant
taking
away
the
expecting
syrupy
sugary
sweet
quality
alcohol
very
well
hidden
in
the
mouth
but
soon
made
my
head
fuzzy
after
half
the
glass
only
1
thanks
overall
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
overall
drinkability
4
0
pleasant
uncomplicated
and
drinkable
lacking
the
complexity
and
depth
i
like
in
a
tripel
but
very
easygoing
considering
the
high
alcohol
content
this
one
could
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
d
for
an
11er
this
hides
the
alcohol
well
intense
sweetness
definitely
does
most
of
the
hiding
it
could
be
a
little
less
sweet
and
a
bit
more
dry
but
overall
that
is
a
minor
gripe
its
certainly
not
cloying
but
very
sweet
an
excellent
sipper
and
even
better
aperitif
reviewed
from
my
notes
the
beer
has
a
translucent
golden
yellow
appearance
there
is
a
thin
ring
of
white
soap
bubbles
on
top
of
the
beer
after
swirling
the
beer
around
the
glass
it
deposits
a
good
foamy
film
as
the
amount
of
beer
in
my
glass
got
lower
i
noticed
that
looking
straight
down
through
the
beer
it
was
clear
it
was
only
transparent
when
viewed
through
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
has
a
lemon
citrus
aroma
with
a
bit
of
musty
yeast
the
taste
has
some
flavors
of
belgian
yeast
crisp
lemon
citrus
and
both
crystal
and
candy
sugars
there
is
some
hops
present
in
the
aftertaste
it
has
a
medium
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
that
makes
it
feel
a
bit
peppery
there
is
a
little
bit
of
mouthcoating
but
not
as
much
as
the
abv
lead
me
to
expect
its
a
crisp
beer
but
the
sweetness
and
strength
would
make
me
limit
myself
to
one
pour
finish
is
big
malty
fruit
nice
if
you
like
a
big
malty
brew
easy
to
drink
though
the
alcohol
is
high
enough
that
you
feel
it
after
one
glass
could
be
a
bit
too
hot
i
get
a
warming
in
the
chest
but
also
in
the
head
ultimately
its
a
very
good
shot
at
a
higher
than
normal
alcohol
tripel
perhaps
because
of
its
heavy
carbonation
its
not
particuarly
quaffable
in
large
doses
it
certainly
tastes
smells
and
look
wonderful
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
to
overcome
to
be
sessionable
very
drinkable
and
nice
for
an
11
tripel
though
just
a
bit
over
the
top
in
my
opinion
i
prefer
ones
that
are
slightly
drier
drinkability
based
on
taste
alone
this
should
get
a
5
but
the
high
alcohol
content
is
the
only
detractor
here
at
11
abv
i
could
only
have
one
maybe
two
in
a
sitting
but
that
is
the
only
problem
here
the
bubbles
kept
going
and
going
helping
to
keep
the
nose
vibrant
and
full
of
life
the
nose
reminded
me
of
grapefruit
or
tart
candy
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
full
of
body
and
fizzy
the
taste
was
beautiful
with
citrus
floral
notes
and
tasted
like
champaign
drinkability
quite
good
i
could
drink
this
all
day
but
it
is
probably
best
that
i
dont
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
the
first
ive
had
from
the
kasteel
series
certainly
powerful
but
undeniably
beautiful
no
bad
words
about
this
tripel
in
a
perfect
world
it
would
have
a
hard
time
but
now
its
holding
its
own
d
a
very
nice
tripel
that
holds
its
own
with
the
many
fine
beers
in
this
class
the
high
abv
makes
for
a
good
nightcap
definitely
worth
the
pickup
notes
this
is
a
decent
tripel
that
definitely
hides
the
11
abv
well
until
the
finish
at
least
but
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
seems
kind
of
weird
and
is
all
over
the
place
at
times
the
citrusy
notes
seem
to
clash
with
the
soft
fruits
and
overwhelm
them
with
that
tart
acidic
sensation
that
makes
it
taste
kind
of
awkward
the
aftertaste
is
rather
offputting
as
well
and
really
hinders
the
drinkability
as
a
result
overall
this
one
missed
the
mark
as
far
as
im
concerned
bought
a
750
ml
bottle
at
my
local
grocery
store
poured
into
a
rochefort
belgian
style
goblet
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
1
finger
head
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
triple
the
nose
is
malty
and
floral
but
not
overwhelming
very
soft
fuzzy
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
up
front
with
a
slight
alcohol
finish
the
hops
are
well
blended
into
the
flavor
and
the
alcohol
is
not
overwhelming
despite
the
high
content
11
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
a
good
representation
of
the
style
a
good
triple
that
strays
away
from
the
category
norm
this
may
put
some
people
off
but
most
will
appreciate
definitely
not
as
good
as
the
same
breweries
brune
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
a
damn
good
beer
drinkability
well
with
us
law
being
a
factor
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
still
high
lovers
of
belgians
and
novices
alike
will
enjoy
kasteels
tripel
its
damn
good
a
nice
enjoyable
brew
overall
this
is
a
great
tripel
i
found
this
much
more
enjoyable
than
their
bruin
due
to
the
appearance
and
this
brew
masks
its
alcohol
a
bit
better
pale
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
spicy
taste
is
sour
green
applesspices
and
alcohol
when
you
look
at
this
in
the
glass
it
looks
very
much
like
a
macro
then
when
you
smell
and
drink
it
you
can
definetly
tell
the
difference
very
warming
and
enjoyable
recommended
and
i
will
purchase
again
i
love
this
beer
i
prefer
the
donkerdark
but
since
it
has
been
about
7years
since
i
had
that
last
i
am
going
to
have
to
hold
out
till
my
visit
to
the
brewery
this
summer
to
make
my
final
judgement
great
summer
evening
closer
close
but
not
quite
as
tasty
as
triple
karmaliet
feel
and
drinkability
body
is
light
and
the
aftertaste
is
longer
lasting
than
maredsous
yet
that
green
apple
is
there
followed
by
an
almost
astringent
alcohol
carbonation
is
light
and
delicate
just
a
bit
more
would
be
nice
if
you
ask
me
nothing
special
nothing
damning
as
far
as
drinkability
id
go
for
the
maredsous
over
this
one
better
flavor
and
considering
that
this
one
is
16
and
change
for
a
fourpack
well
itll
be
a
while
till
i
drink
this
one
again
if
ever
it
really
doesnt
do
it
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
should
be
better
for
the
price
i
mean
the
donker
and
the
rouge
are
worth
the
price
this
one
not
so
much
so
again
a
very
easydrinking
tripel
despite
the
alcohol
content
just
be
careful
as
this
can
sneak
up
on
you
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nice
balance
a
fairly
balanced
tripel
but
not
quite
my
favourite
overall
the
11abv
obviously
makes
this
something
you
wouldnt
really
want
to
session
putting
that
aside
the
lingering
stickysweetness
would
probably
make
me
pass
this
one
over
in
the
future
however
id
call
this
beer
a
good
value
at
8
or
so
for
the
750
and
its
definitely
not
something
id
classify
as
undrinkable
overall
a
very
strong
triple
dominated
by
the
unnecessarily
high
abv
its
too
boozy
for
my
liking
and
not
smooth
enough
on
the
way
down
i
could
finish
it
but
it
wasnt
really
enjoyable
ive
had
more
than
my
share
of
triples
and
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
mess
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
their
wonderful
bruin
not
a
favourite
and
i
wont
be
picking
this
one
up
again
overall
this
is
a
rather
average
tripel
id
reach
for
a
number
of
other
tripels
first
but
if
this
is
all
thats
available
its
decent
enough
brew
to
please
most
people
this
is
a
big
beer
good
drinkability
but
not
sustained
drinkability
pretty
dry
a
pretty
good
belgian
trippel
worth
trying
this
beer
is
a
somewhat
hazy
golden
liquid
the
head
is
massive
and
brilliantly
white
the
aroma
is
a
little
spicy
with
some
alcohol
and
fruit
notes
pear
lemon
and
apple
the
spice
is
a
bit
peppery
and
theres
also
a
little
yeast
in
the
smell
no
notable
hop
aroma
although
the
taste
is
a
semisweet
it
is
balanced
with
a
notquite
hot
spiciness
alcohol
warming
is
intense
theres
considerable
bitterness
that
starts
in
the
hindtaste
and
continues
well
through
the
finish
medium
body
and
very
carbonated
giving
the
beer
a
prickly
sensation
good
tripel
overallrather
nice
beer
not
the
best
triple
ive
tried
but
i
wasnt
disappointed

with
ample
carbonation
enough
lacing
to
admire
aroma
is
yeasty
and
doughy
alcohol
and
floral
notes
are
there
as
well
was
expecting
more
of
a
singe
from
the
alcohol
given
the
abv
a
lot
of
yeast
and
bread
in
the
taste
the
hops
give
it
a
nice
bite
really
shocked
that
this
beer
is
11
the
alcohol
is
there
but
is
masked
quite
well
beer
has
a
champagne
like
effervescence
a
very
worthy
tripel
im
still
not
sure
how
they
masked
the
alcohol
so
well
if
you
like
tripels
this
is
a
good
bet
not
the
best
that
ive
had
but
a
good
bang
for
the
buck
notes
consider
me
impressed
everyone
should
try
this
beer
and
especially
if
you
love
tripels
like
i
do
d
while
the
taste
is
nice
the
11
would
knock
me
out
if
i
had
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
the
smell
was
fruity
and
had
mostly
sour
notes
like
apples
it
was
lively
in
the
mouth
and
had
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
seems
to
be
typical
of
this
style
it
was
semi
dry
and
had
a
good
bitterness
to
it
overall
i
enjoyed
the
brew
and
would
buy
again
once
a
year

d
this
is
a
mixed
bag
of
a
beer
some
aspects
are
strong
but
the
taste
is
decidedly
average
pours
a
very
bright
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
an
obvious
smell
of
candied
sugars
that
you
find
in
most
belgian
beers
this
beer
masks
the
high
alcohol
content
fairly
well
but
has
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
as
it
warms
the
taste
mellows
and
you
get
a
bit
of
a
fruity
flavor
but
the
aftertaste
is
still
there
and
lingers
on
the
tongue
i
like
this
beer
but
have
found
better
versions
in
the
style
overall
this
one
remains
representative
of
the
style
but
boy
others
do
it
a
lot
better
not
my
fav
trippel
but
worth
trying
some
like
it
hot
some
dont
if
you
like
it
hot
you
may
like
this
drinkability
is
medium
for
me
the
high
alcohol
content
would
stop
me
from
having
too
many
overall
a
decent

impressive
beer
from
kasteel
served
on
tap
at
the
belgian
beer
fest
at
the
muddy
pig
in
st
paul
on

and
again
on
draft
on
917leftovers
woohoo
this
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
leaving
a
fine
white
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fruity
and
citrussy
the
taste
oh
the
taste
to
me
this
was
the
best
tasting
tripel
at
the
fest
and
there
were
a
bunch
of
themincluding
gouden
carolous
st
bernardus
st
feullian
val
dieu
la
rulles
and
des
rocs
as
well
as
some
domestic
versions
the
flavors
i
tasted
included
banana
cherry
a
brandylike
alcohol
flavor
a
slight
citrussy
lemonorange
flavor
a
sweet
caramelhoney
flavor
and
a
light
crispness
i
found
irresistable
the
disparate
flavors
blended
into
an
outstanding
whole
the
mouthfeel
is
light
yet
fullflavored
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
until
its
gonehopefully
not
for
a
while
tried
a
bottle
of
this
as
recommended
by
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
during
a
friday
night
visit
to
la
cav
du
vin
several
weeks
back
an
11
2
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
fat
tulip
glass
pours
a
cloudy
crisp
looking
medium
golden
color
the
white
head
was
well
over
an
inch
when
poured
good
retention
and
lacing
here
indeed
eventually
settles
to
a
good
13
inch
and
then
14
inch
malty
aromas
vanilla
clove
and
other
spices
maybe
a
bit
of
fruit
here
as
well
such
as
apple
or
banana
has
a
sweet
and
caramel
malty
flavor
with
a
bit
of
the
aforementioned
spice
and
fruit
definitely
banana
the
taste
of
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
a
bit
more
than
in
most
7
abv
beers
i
suppose
has
a
crisp
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
a
fine
beer
all
around
fair
renowned
brew
from
belgium
o
this
is
a
wellconstructed
tripel
from
one
of
the
belgian
masters
and
i
really
want
to
love
it
there
is
something
in
the
flavor
profile
that
throws
me
off
and
may
just
be
my
own
senses
it
is
not
bad
just
not
my
favorite
an
excellent
beer
just
not
quite
right
for
my
palate
this
was
the
first
chimay
i
ever
tried
and
i
was
hoping
for
a
lot
more
the
blue
one
was
definetly
better
not
my
favorite
style
but
okay
o
a
very
interesting
complex
tripel
worth
a
try
for
any
lover
of
belgiums
or
any
good
beer
lover
for
that
matter
o
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
with
great
complexity
and
flavors
the
flavors
are
very
smooth
and
clean
as
well
so
it
drinks
very
easily
its
pretty
approachable
and
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
this
is
the
best
triple
iv
ever
had
i
really
love
this
beer
surprising
salt
flavor
that
worked
well
refreshing
but
i
prefer
the
blue
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
with
very
mild
carbonation
a
medium
to
chewy
body
and
a
finish
on
the
dry
side
that
is
clean
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
with
a
bready
aftertaste
this
bottle
was
aged
at
least
2
years
and
so
perhaps
it
was
not
as
fresh
as
it
should
be
enjoyed
so
my
assessment
is
a
slight
disappointment
as
i
recall
this
being
better
the
last
few
times
i
drank
it
will
try
it
again
for
sure
with
a
newer
bottle
and
give
this
classic
its
due
which
may
drive
up
the
overall
score
i
always
drink
the
red
but
this
is
a
step
above
overly
carbonated
and
extremely
bitter
overall
perhaps
more
of
a
masterpiece
than
its
stronger
sisters
in
that
its
balance
couldnt
be
better
and
that
its
full
flavor
is
neither
dried
out
by
hops
andor
carbonation
nor
drowned
out
by
alcohol
this
beer
is
soft
sweet
spicy
and
hearty
and
because
no
one
element
outshines
the
rest
its
many
qualities
can
be
easily
appreciated
pour
in
tulip
at
bobeau
la
mesa
so
after
1500
reviews
it
may
be
best
to
simply
say
that
compared
to
other
tripels
this
one
is
a
bit
muted
more
subtle
more
easy
drinking
each
of
the
expected
profiles
that
we
see
from
the
likes
of
westmalle
or
st
bernardus
are
indeed
present
just
in
a
less
intense

nice

really
good
stuff
and
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
the
tripel
style
very
crisp
refreshing
delicious
and
drinkable
especially
nice
that
i
found
it
on
tap
i
will
seek
this
and
other
beers
from
this
brewer
out
again
for
sure
overall
much
more
subtle
than
i
expected
i
did
not
consider
myself
a
fan
of
tripels
but
chimay
is
changing
my
mind
ill
have
to
explore
a
little
more
to
see
if
i
can
appreciate
the
style
in
the
future
definitely
a
winner
here
velvet

would

really
my

i
like

with
a
super

very

which
i
like
o
hell
ya
would
seek
when
craving
a
triple
but
do
not
want
overwhelmed
excellent
beers
from
chimay
the
trappist
have
been
making
beer
for
a
long
time
and
really
know
how
to
make
some
tasty
stuff
i
prefer
to
pour
mine
and
include
the
yeast
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
think
it
adds
to
the
beer
which
is
excellent
either
way
i
really
enjoy
the
clean
finish
that
these
beers
have
as
well
as
the
depth
of
flavor
that
the
yeast
gives
exquisite
and
smooth
creamy
with
a
lite
bite
this
is
what
i
love
above
chimay
they
dont
make
a
lot
of
different
beers
but
what
they
make
is
spectacular

tripel
ive
really
thought
was

that
will
dissipate

overall
a

brew
and
the
fact
that
i
can
find
it
pretty
much
everywhere
there
are
better
tripels
but
not
many
that
ive
tried
so
far
and
no
by
so
much
that
this
seems
like
a
disappointment
fantastic
beer
and
fantastic
style
that
here
seems
to
mix
belgian
strong
pales
dubbels
and
a
pinch
of
hefeweizen
very
elegant
fruity
tripel
with
a
subtle
tartness
and
superbly
well
balanced
complexity
comes
slowly
in
small
pieces
huge
drinkability
for
its
high
abv
very
easy
to
drink
for
new
lovers
and
still
interesting
for
experienced
o
overall
balanced
and
drinkable
with
a
surprisingly
high
level
of
spicy
hops
very
enjoyable
its
no
wonder
its
considered
a
world
classic
of
the
style
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
vivacious
carbonation
surprisingly
clear
surprising
head
persistence
and
body
good
aroma
of
hefeweissenesque
banana
and
lemon
in
the
smoke
upon
opening
although
aroma
was
somewhat
weaker
upon
pouring
crude
stab
at
mouthfeel
medium
body
taste
initially
dominated
by
boozy
peppery
bitterness
upon
acclimation
picked
up
the
aforementioned
hefeweissenesque
banana
notes
as
well
as
the
soft
sweetness
of
mango
i
liked
this
beer
because
it
is
elegant
in
its
simplicity
like
wellsourced
meat
or
vegetables
that
let
subtle
natural
tastes
do
the
talking
alright
before
i
get
teary
eyed
lets
do
the
review
poured
from
a
brown
25
4
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
yeast
taste
is
somewhat
fruity
pepper
malts
alcohol
is
present
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
a
quality
beer
didnt
really
live
up
to
my
expectations
o
a
very
enjoyable
balanced
beer
surprised
that
of
the
3
chomays
i
tried
together
i
might
have
liked
this
the
best
pours
a
beautiful
pale
gold
with
a
fair
head
and
lacing
that
kept
reminding
me
of
the
elvish
language
the
taste
is
straight
up
yeast
and
banana
with
a
huge
wheat
profile
finishes
with
a
mellow
sweetness
that
is
beautifully
balanced
for
a
triple
great
beer
for
a
wheat
beer
lover
a
classic
by
most
standards
the
appearance
is
a
golden
color
with
a
very
sticky
white
head
the
smell
is
mostly
bread
with
some
sweet
scents
like
banana
the
taste
had
a
lot
of
banana
and
pear
in
with
the
malt
they
used
also
a
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
end
from
the
alcohol
the
only
thing
i
thought
was
odd
was
the
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
triple
still
very
enjoyable
would
definitely
recommend
o
a
very
smooth
drinking
tripel
with
a
solid
balance
of
flavors
recommended
o
good
belgian
stands
up
to
the
style
ooverall
a
fantastic
triple
my
go
to
so
far
medium
body
and
nice
carbonation
that
make
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
overall
a
good
fresh
tripel
that
suits
a
warm
evening
well
not
spectacular
but
worth
tasting
a
nice
solid
triple
but
i
would
like
to
see
more
fruit
flavors
in
it
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
belgian
made
beer
it
does
have
the
classic
flavors
of
a
triple
what
keeps
it
from
being
a
truly
outstanding
beer
is
a
lack
of
complexity
and
a
bit
too
much
spice
still
a
nice
beer
worth
giving
a
try
o
its
a
bit
much
very
boozy
and
phenolic
the
better
abbey
style
tripels
hide
their
strength
far
better
than
this
rich
crisp
head
crisp
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
quite
active
carbonation
bitter
tart
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
throughout
but
less
so
than
one
might
expect
from
8
abv
pours
a
nice
clean
golden
amber
with
a
thick

good
and
tastes
really
good

some
funky
finish
at
the
end
with
sweetness
lots
of
things
going
on
yet
very
harmonious
fresh
clean
slightly
champagney
bitter
sweet
a
really
good
beer
pours
a
muddy
orange
color
with
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
thick
frothy
lacing
the
nose
is
yeastforward
with
pepper
clove
banana
melon
orange
and
a
light
honey
sweetness
even
though
its
subdued
quite
a
lot
of
character
comes
out
as
you
get
your
nose
in
close
tasting
it
i
get
more
of
that
light
honey
sweetness
some
earthy
hops
black
pepper
banana
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
end
the
body
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation
and
it
finishes
dry
o
this
is
a
solid
tripel
that
is
both
refreshing
and
smooth
makes
for
a
great
sipping
beer
in
the
summertime
its
moderately
complex
with
a
nice
balance
tilted
towards
the
hops
but
tripel
karmeliet
la
fin
du
monde
valdieu
and
westmalle
are
still
the
best
in
class
tripels
in
my
books
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
dissipated
quickly
this
is
a
malt
forward
offering
but
it
is
relatively
lightbodied
considering
the
abv
the
taste
is
ever
so
slightly
sweet
upfront
with
a
dry
mildly
hoppy
finish
this
is
one
of
the
most
wellbalanced
beers
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
d
at
8
this
was
a
slowgoing
sipper
im
not
sure
that
id
want
to
bite
off
much
more
very
sweet
and
too
bold
impressed
me
with
its
balance
nice
interplay
of
sweetness
and
belgian
yeasty
aromas
certainly
a
strong
contender
in
its
field
very
flavourful
but
could
maybe
improve
by
toning
down
the
cloying
aspects
that
are
sticky
about
half
way
through
then
dissipate
still
an
excellent
beer
worth
trying
for
sure
cheers

overall
a

to
revisit
an

this
beer
strikes
the
quintessential
balance
of
finesse
and
strength
the
holy
aspect
of
brewing
that
blesses
and
breaks
in

o
a
very
nice
beer
in
fact
it
is
probably
my
favorite
triple
the
dryness
is
maybe
abit
over
the
top
and
the
taste
on
the
mouth
ends
abruptly
i
feel
this
is
a
two
edged
sword
because
while
it
retracts
from
the
flavor
it
makes
you
want
to
immediately
take
another
swig
to
get
the
flavors
again
not
a
wow
you
type
beer
but
solid
none
the
less
with
good
drinkability
o
honestly
this
might
be
my
favorite
of
the
three
chimay
beers
and
to
think
i
expected
this
one
to
be
my
least
favorite
it
isnt
terribly
complex
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
to
savor
this
is
the
only
one
id
go
back
to
on
a
regular
basis
o
like
the
blue
and
the
red
this
is
a
great
beer
that
is
perhaps
overrated
i
certainly
believe
blue
to
be
overrated
this
is

uma
ótima
cerveja
mas
foi
a
chimay
que
menos
me
agradou
o
que
me
incomodou
foi
o
frutado
excessivo
a
percepção
do
lúpulo
não
tão
empolgante
mas
com
certeza
é
mais
um
brilhante
rótulo
do

chimay
é
um
dos

trapista
indispensável
para
qualquer
apreciador
do

o
great

unique

stands
out
of
most

definitely
a
most
try
overall
the

and
too
bitter

not

id
seek
out
again
poured
from
a
330
ml

goblet
chimays
tripel
is
a
golden
sparkly
amber
color
just
shy
of
light
orange
with
ample
offwhite
head
that
retains
its
shape
well
like
its
stablemates
aroma
quite
sweet
and
spicy
pale
malts
that
evoke
shortbread
or
sweet
dough
fruit
notes
like
green
apple
and
white
grapes
citrus
fruits
tobacco
yellow
flowers
and
spicy
phenols
palate
is
that
of
a
classic
tripel
rather
crisp
and
dry
and
amazingly
smooth
with
considerable
carbonation
that
lifts
the
sweet
and
spicy
flavors
up
without
obscuring
them
would
be
among
the
most
drinkable
of
trappist
ales
were
it
not
so
hot
and
spicy
ample
clove
and
medicinal
phenol
character
hot
aromatic
alcohol
a
fruity
sourness
like
cranberry
a
fruity
sweetness
like
apricots
i
get
little
dark
fruit
character
and
this
makes
it
stand
apart
from
its
maltier
cousins
vague
hints
of
banana
and
a
residual
candi
sugar
sweetness
that
you
can
detect
in
the
finish
amidst
the
potent
spice
and
bittersweet
floral
notes
think
marigold
or
dandelion
and
dry
walnut
bitterness
this
beer
changes
with
age
and
i
wonder
if
an
older
example
would
be
less
pungent
although
according
to
micheal
jackson
the
beer
critic
the
clove
flavors
actually
develop
with
age
fantastically
good
beer
that
stands
out
in
the
smoothness
department
overall
a
good
beer
perhaps
lacking
a
bit
in
explosive
flavors
or
aroma
but
theres
plenty
of
subtlety
here
to
make
this
noteworthy
enjoy
overall
great
beer
perfect
for
the
style
nice
spice
pepper
phenolics
are
outstanding
alcohol
is
not
over
powering
but
warming
of
the
three
varieties
red
white
blue
this
one
is
my
least
favorite
yet
has
the
most
drinkability
if
that
makes
any
sense
it
was
tasted
during
the
same
sitting
as
the
other
two
poured
from
11
2
bottles
into
chimay
chalices
yes
it
was
the
gift
pack
the
other
two
have
qualities
that
must
be
savored
but
this
one
has
more
of
the
massappeal
drink
your
cock
in
the
dirt
feel
to
it
albeit
a
pretty
awesome
one
cheers
by
bitternes
more
similar
to
westmalle
than
st
bernardus
tripel
very
good
but
i
prefer
those
two
o
a
rock
solid
standard
classic
triple
easily
my
favorite
out
of
the
three
chimay
colours
a
must
try
tripel
o
a
mild
and
particularly
yeasty
tripel
chimays
tripel
aka
cinq
cents
pours
a
russet
sort
of
hue
which
is
just
right
for
the
style
a
billowy
offwhite
head
appears
after
a
strong
pour
and
then
recedes
to
about
a
quarterinch
or
less
there
is
some
carbonation
visibly
apparent
the
aroma
consists
of
bright
fruits
caramel
walnut
and
an
earthy
or
mossy
type
of
scent
when
evaluating
the
smell
of
the
older
bottle
1998
the
fruit
esters
seemed
to
make
me
imagine
darker
fruits
like
figs
and
raisins
molasses
instead
of
caramel
and
burgundy
wine
the
flavor
of
chimay
has
that
nice
cranberrydark
fruit
flavor
with
an
woodyearthy
facade
when
fresh
theres
the
tiniest
hinto
of
hops
in
the
taste
the
finish
lingers
and
there
is
a
medium
mouth
feel
the
alcohol
is
masked
extremely
well
overall
as
i
previously
stated
this
is
a
musthave
tripel
especially
if
you
or
a
friend
are
just
getting
into
the
style
if
you
age
or
have
the
chance
to
try
an
older
bottle
that
was
properly
stored
youll
find
that
it
mellows
out
into
something
much
softer
go
get
some
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
it
does
not
coat
the
mouth
but
it
finishes
drier
than
expected
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
it
is
very
good
but
it
didnt
have
that
wow
factor
i
was
hoping
for
it
pours
well
and
smells
great
but
the
aftertaste
didnt
really
leave
me
excited
for
the
next
time
i
got
the
chance
to
have
one
very
good
and
i
certainly
would
never
turn
one
down
but
i
think
i
paid
at
least
11
for
this
one
and
for
that
price
i
want
my
socks
knocked
off
the
bottle
said
to
serve
chilled
and
i
did
but
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
more
as
it
warmed
up
a
little
this
is
a
good
beer
but
my
least
favorite
chimay
and
far
below
what
i
expect
in
a
tripel
i
wont
avoid
it
in
the
future
but
i
cant
see
picking
this
over
westmalle
or
even
a
good
domestic
tripel
a
brilliant
beer
that
is
often
overlooked
perhaps
due
to
its
wide
availability
i
bought
this
beer
from
the
local
grocery
store
as
a
matter
of
fact
really
a
great
representation
of
the
golden
ales
of
belgium
dont
know
if
id
recommend
this
to
everyone
as
you
have
to
like
your
beers
on
the
sharper
side
to
get
behind
this
but
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
and
if
you
share
my
tastes
this
is
one
youll
easily
get
behind
o
wonderful
i
like
how
this
is
not
a
complete
malt
bomb
it
gives
chimay
a
larger
range
with
some
nice
hop
character
very
tasty
and
definitely
a
goto
if
im
not
feeling
the
sweetness
of
other
tripels
o
a
solid
tripel
that
simply
strays
far
from
my
personal
preferences
flavor
is
well
crafted
and
unique
with
a
balanced
dryness
that
i
usually
find
overdone
in
the
style
overall
4
25
excellent
beer
and
an
outstanding
tripel
certainly
one
to
buy
for
festive
occasions
but
this
baby
is
also
good
for
an
old
fashioned
sessioning
you
taste
zero
of
the
8
abv
which
is
a
good
and
bad
thing
not
one
to
knock
back
if
you
have
to
fly
the
helicopter
home
but
one
to
enjoy
by
the
fire
on
a
cold
winter
night
or
in
your
shorts
on
a
hot
august
night
in
georgia
like
i
just
did
recommended
overall
a
classic
triple
for
a
reason
it
is
dry
and
yet
exciting
brew
with
a
drier
moderately
yeasty
lightly
hopped
and
nicely
spiced
flavor
served
from
750ml
bottle
overall
a
great
tripel
on
par
with
many
of
the
best
very
accessible
and
definitely
worth
a
try
although
a
little
less
sweetness
than
some
of
the
others
im
not
that
knowledgeable
about
different
types
of
scent
profiles
or
specific
flavours
so
i
wont
go
into
those
details
but
this
beer
is
fantastic
incredible
smell
good
level
of
carbonation
but
the
taste
my
god
one
of
the
absolute
best
tasting
beers
ive
ever
had
deep
rich
complex
flavours
yet
surprisingly
soft
on
the
pallet
not
harsh
at
all
excellent
beer
highly
highly
recommended
i
cant
believe
how
cheap
and
readily
available
this
is
at
the
lcbo
dont
miss
out
on
this
if
you
like
trappist
beers
or
any
kind
of
strong
ales
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
the
flavours
are
subtle
but
tasty
overall
a
great
beer
like
it
has
always
been
surprisingly
dry
hop
bitterness
was
refreshing
m
again
superb
its
not
too
heavy
or
light
and
the
carbonation
plays
with
the
taste
wonderfully
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
impression
a
fine
tripel
but
not
as
complex
or
deep
in
flavor
as
westmalle
or
st
bernardus
cinq
cents
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
an
off
white
head
of
very
fine
very
soft
foamy
bubbles
the
nose
is
floral
hops
and
bright
citrus
grapefruit
superb
retention
and
lacing
the
taste
is
smooth
creamy
and
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
until
it
warms
you
in
the
long
dry
finish
crisp
its
perfectly
balanced
so
that
the
citrus
is
not
at
all
sour
its
perfect
and
elegant
overall

starts
off
a
tad
bitter
then
the
sweet
bready
malts
and
belgian
yeast
kick
in
also
sweet
fruits
are
in
there
very
complex
and
a
an
awsome
brew
one
of
the
best
tripels
imho
o
a
nice
triple
but
it
was
drier
than
i
expected
i
also
found
the
alcohol
a
bit
more
prominent
than
i
have
with
other
tripels
which
i
was
not
expecting
from
a
chimay
this
would
make
a
great
beer
on
a
chilly
fall
evening
o
nice
beer
for
the
style
had
on
tap
i
thought
that
this
was
a
belgian
witbeer
when
i
was
drinking
it
has
some
banana
flavors
to
it
i
thought
white
indicated
wit
it
was
cloudy
llike
a
wheat
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
thicker
like
wheat
as
well
call
me
crazy
but
i
didnt
second
guess
it
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
but
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
id
just
go
try
something
else
same
for
the
alcohol
i
couldnt
believe
that
this
was
8
00
abv
as
i
finished
it
off
and
could
only
taste
the
mild
fruit
and
subtle
sourness
of
this
this
wasnt
like
any
tripel
ive
ever
had
and
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
mead
since
theres
an
undercurrent
of
fermented
honey
to
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
easily
my
favorite
chimay
and
something
i
could
enjoy
all
night
long
certainly
not
to
be
missed
i
had
this
blind
taste
tested
with
westmalle
and
la
fin
du
monde
this
came
in
last
with
la
fin
first
it
still
does
not
take
away
from
this
being
a
fantastic
beer
pairs
very
well
with
ceviche
and
mexican
caesar
salads
its
even
killer
with
mozzarella
paninis
from
starbucks
o
this
is
an
excellent
brew
should
i
factor
price
in
to
my
rating
im
not
sure
if
so
you
have
to
dock
this
a
little
bit
because
14bottle
is
a
bit
steep
when
you
can
get
la
fin
de
monde
for
2
or
3
dollars
cheeper
delicious
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
o
a
really
good
tripel
with
fruits
and
hops
where
they
must
be
complex
with
sweetness
bitterness
and
a
dry
feel
that
make
a
great
experience
all
the
trappist
elegance
is
present
in
this
ale
o
decent
beer
again
this
is
not
exactly
my
favorite
but
it
its
bad
there
are
many
other
tripels
that
i
would
rather
drink
overall
pretty
nice
tripel
the
flavors
could
have
been
more
noticeable
but
everything
was
balanced
out
easily
making
it
hard
to
pick
up
on
anything
more
please
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
just
strong
enough
to
be
slightly
fizzy
without
prickly
or
painful
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
ably
foamy
and
smooth
flowing
across
the
palate
quite
well
closes
quite
dry
with
only
slight
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
o
this
is
a
delightful
tripel
definitely
one
to
try
o
perplexing
and
refined
i
entered
this
blind
test
thinking
i
wasnt
wild
about
chimay
white
so
that
era
is
over
mopped
the
floor
with
achel
8
blond
o
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bitter
white
grapefruit
flavour
took
over
the
final
taste
so
its
best
drunk
at
the
right
temperature
i
have
had
this
beer
twice
and
have
learned
so
much
since
my
first
review
really
well
crafted
beer
great
sipper
by
itself
it
would
go
well
with
sharp
aged
cheddar
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tried
for
me
it
has
the
perfect
balance
between
hoppiness
texture
aroma
bitterness
and
flavor
from
the
hundreds
of
beers
i
have
tried
this
one
stands
out
to
optimize
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
we
poured
it
on
an
approved
chimay
glass
that
came
with
this
beer
the
head
levels
were
perfect
lasted
a
few
minutes
which
is
the
way
i
like
it
not
too
long
or
short
color
was
perfect
not
too
murky
not
to
clear
i
will
give
it
98
out
of
100
i
would
love
to
know
how
this
would
taste
on
tap
olacked
wellrounded
and
vibrant
flavor
profile
of
other
top
triples
decent
but
not
among
my
favorites
of
the
style
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
but
a
bit
less
than
i
did
with
the
blue
or
red
im
not
too
big
of
a
fan
for
tripels
more
for
dubbels
or
quads
still
this
beer
holds
true
for
chimays
excellency
in
beer
production
great
balance
but
has
a
slightly
steep
price
but
its
somewhat
justified
it
is
pretty
damn
good
recommended
by
me
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
nice
chimay
white
so
lets
see
how
it
goes
tonight
it
pours
a
lightlycloudy
amberbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
bread
belgian
yeast
light
clove
and
a
hint
of
orange
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
more
clove
and
black
pepper
and
a
bit
of
banana
peel
for
good
measure
the
breadiness
is
also
toned
down
a
bit
here
helping
the
spices
shine
through
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
nice
tripel
but
not
quite
the
paragon
of
the
style
i
used
to
consider
it
being
the
yeast
comes
across
too
bready
and
dominant
to
allow
for
much
nuance
to
surface
but
at
least
its
a
tasty
yeast
effect
overall
this
is
a
blandtasting
poorly
balanced
brew
not
worthy
of
a
belgium
beer
aficionado
id
choose
this
at
a
sports
bar
if
there
was
nothing
else
available
to
get
me
buzzed
pours

o
a
really
nice
tripel
i
was
a
little
worried
when
i
first
smelled
it
because
of
the
banana
aroma
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
it
had
a
depth
of
other
complex
flavors
oone
of
the
few
beers
that
approached
the
level
of
damnation
for
me
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
othis
is
an
enjoyable
tripel
i
happen
to
like
the
sweetness
of
the
yeast
here
but
others
may
want
a
more
herbal
variety
fabulous
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
drinkable
but
not
chugable
beer
thick
creamy
texture
with
a
slight
warming
that
finishes
dry
o
out
of
the
four
beers
tasted
during
this
small
tasting
this
stood
out
in
a
different
class
exceptionally
well
balanced
beer
as
a
personal
note
i
prefer
the
red
and
blue
chimays
the
bitterness
in
this
one
not
personally
desired
so
much
in
this
style
o
smooth
an
delicate
with
light
flavors
refreshing
carbonation
a
pleasant
ale
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
monks
putting
in
good
work
the
carbonation
here
is
high
with
a
particular
bite
in
the
finish
not
super
drinkable
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
this
is
good
but
i
prefer
westmalle
the
chimay
tripel
has
the
expected
golden
hazy
appearance
with
a
creamy
white
neck
the
aroma
emanates
pears
and
apples
with
very
slight
background
tones
of
breadcaramel
the
taste
is
powerful
the
hops
are
very
present
in
this
full
bodied
creamy
and
wellcarbonated
beer
a
slight
acidity
can
be
noticed
in
the
background
superbly
balance
with
the
hop
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
long
and
hoppy
and
leaves
a
beautiful
belgian
lace
in
your
glass
this
is
a
refreshing
and
as
it
should
be
potent
tripel
but
delicate
at
the
same
time
go
figure
this
beer
is
excellent
this
beer
sucks
tastes
like
a
carbonated
milkshake
cant
believe
i
spent
five
dollars
on
this
poor
excuse
of
a
beer
while
i
could
of
got
a
bomber
of
stone
ipa
for
the
same
price
those
monks
are
drinking
to
much
of
their
own
product
and
theyre
drunk
during
the
entire
process
i
will
try
again
once
they
sober
up
and
quit
adding
cinnamon
and
sugar
to
their
beers

a

tripel
overall
a

the
style
and
a
deceptive
8
abv
given
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
this
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
head
there
is
a
scent
of
citrus
wheat
and
hops
there
are
lots
of
bubbles
constantly
rising
to
the
top
there
are
tastes
of
smooth
yeasty
wheat
with
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
overall
its
creamy
delicious
and
well
made
o
not
bad
but
this
is
a
chimay
the
only
nonstellar
chimay
in
my
experience
must
try
tripel
o
one
of
the
best
tripels
on
the
market
this
is
the
way
its
done
folks
o
very
nice
tripel
one
of
the
best
o
the
overall
experience
is
a
nice
spicy
malty
beer
it
is
very
tasty
this
is
a
solid
tripel
i
wouldnt
place
it
as
top
tier
but
its
actually
better
than
i
anticipated
its
too
yeasty
for
its
own
good
and
the
malts
arent
particularly
interesting
otherwise
i
agree
this
is
a
classic
notes
well
i
tried
something
new
and
didnt
like
it
but
on
the
plus
side
at
least
im
trying
something
new
overall
this
beer
was
the
hit
of
the
night
last
week
when
my
friends
and
i
made
a
pilgrimage
to
a
beer
store
to
fill
our
wish
list
they
all
agreed
that
this
beer
my
purchase
was
the
surprise
of
the
night
i
had
little
doubt
i
want
to
make
trippel
that
tastes
this
good
hey
it
might
not
have
the
most
impressive
nose
but
you
cant
knock
this
beer
chimay
tripel
is
a
godfather
to
most
and
many
im
just
glad
i
still
love
it
overall
very
good
strong
beer
and
goes
down
nice
overall
this
is
an
excellent
well
balanced
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
triple
but
still
good
i
would
choose
others
over
this
one
any
day
o
something
nice
about
pouring
a
beer
you
know
is
going
to
be
good
will
gladly
grab
any
chimay
when
the
itch
comes
about
note
previous
tasting
had
been
an
aged
bottle
1
yr
and
was
not
very
positive
so
either
dont
reco
ageing
this
one
or
i
hadnt
stored
properly
f
the
natural
flavorings
from
the
yeast
truly
shape
this
beer
bittering
hops
balance
it
all
together
i
get
bananaclove
and
a
bit
of
an
applepear
taste
throughout
its
life
which
im
about
to
finish
off
all
in
all
trappist
brewed
and
one
of
a
kind
overall
not
bad
but
not
really
great
either
ive
tasted
it
before
cheaper
and
better
too
its
refreshing
but
too
alcohol
heavy
to
consider
it
for
this
purpose
which
is
a
bit
of
the
thing
of
more
heavy
beers
going
for
the
fresh
summer
flavor
it
just
doesnt
really
work
not
sure
what
to
do
with
this
one
not
a
keeper
for
me
o
good
beer
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
poured
all
of
the
yeast
in
but
still
very
belgian
very
trappist
creamy
mouth
feel
with
good
carbonation
support
a
great
beer
that
was
my
introduction
to
belgian
ales
years
ago

aromas
are

also
a
little
fruity
and

huge
fluffy
cloud
like
white

shimmers
down

very
dark

nice

the

slight

dry

well
hidden

there
is
a

a

sips
light
bodied
with
a
dry

decent
but
not
as
good
as
i
anticipated
overall
just
bland
body
is
great
though
with
the
creamy

this
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
big
fluffy
off

world
class
retention
and
some

smell
is
raisins
banana

moving

metallic
dry
sour

mouthfeel
is
dry
with
a

of

honestly
not
my
favorite
i
expected
more
final
thoughts
chimay
delivers
with
another
great
representation
of
the
style
no
off
flavors
but
nothing
special
either
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
o
well
made
beer
i
like
the
blue
labeled
chimay
better
but
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
overall
a
pleasant
brew
the
only
thing
setting
this
one
back
is
the
price
otherwise
this
is
as
good
a
beer
as
ive
ever
had
notes
this
is
a
great
and
awesome
beer
that
went
by
way
too
fast
cant
wait
for
my
next
bottle
had
ontap
around
the
corner
appearance
was
a
light
orange
golden
color
with
very
slight
almost
nonexistent
creamy
head
that
was
likely
due
more
to
the
college
pour
from
the
bartender
than
the
beer
itself
caught
a
surprising
whiff
of
bananas
cloves
and
dried
fruit
reminded
me
of
a
weird
heffy
but
in
a
good
way
taste
was
awesome
white
grape
fruitiness
at
first
with
a
dry
peppery
bite
to
it
on
the
back
end
i
also
tasted
a
bit
of
booziness
that
lingered
well
after
sipping
very
carbonated
but
it
goes
well
with
the
style
really
enjoyed
this
beer
though
it
could
be
more
nostalgia
driving
this
review
as
chimay
was
what
got
me
into
craft
beer
o
a
true
trappist
tripel
that
is
fairly
complex
not
the
best
drinkability
but
a
must
try
poured
from
a
bottle
at
stubbies
in

nice
frothy

grape
pear
bananaand
yeasty
aroma
flavor
follows
with
steong
yeast
mixed
in
some
banana
fig
and
some
belgian
tang
that
balances
the
sweet
so
nicely
very
nice
beer
chimay
may
be
my
favorite
belgian
brewery
and
definitely
is
at
the
top
of
my
trappistes
across
their
beers
o
white
not
quite
as
good
as
its
red
and
blue
counterparts
still
very
solid
highly
drinkable
and
well
balanced
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
that
shows
remarkable
retention
and
tons
of
lace
smells
of
pepper
and
light
sweet
sugar
with
hints
of
orange
marmalade
tons
of
yeast
and
fruity
esters
with
little
to
no
hop
presence
the
flavor
is
filled
with
sweet
sugary
maltiness
with
honey
and
light
sugars
being
in
the
forefront
sweet
light
fruit
flavors
of
orange
and
tangerine
with
a
light
sweet
cherry
flavor
lots
of
pepper
and
yeasty
phenols
round
this
out
quite
nicely
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
prickly
mouthfeel
very
well
balanced
well
made
beer
as
common
as
this
is
its
hard
to
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
it
just
an
all
time
classic
havent
had
this
one
for
about
7
years
nice
pour
with
a
pillow
white
head
with
some
interesting
pear
like
dryness
on
the
nose
complete
floral
yet
not
overwhelming
apricot
champagne
in
the

finishes
dry
like
a
vermouth
easy
to
drink
and
very
powerful
although
undetected
by
the
nose
or
tongue
outstanding
top
shelf
chimay
greatness
i
may
argue
this
is
a
belgian
strong
ale
instead
of
a
tripel
but
then
again
wtf
do
i
know
theyve
been
brewing
it
for
centuries
itll
put
cinq
sense
into
your
beer
brain
overall
good
beer
but
i
dont
buy
the
hype
and
its
not
a
beer
id
buy
again
at
the
price
its
sold
for
ive
never
been
big
on
trappist
ales
drinking
the
highly
touted
chimay
series
further
confirms
this
to
each
their
own
overall
ill
tone
it
down
i
just
love
this
stuff
and
im
not
sure
why
i
keep
trying
all
those
other
beers
when
i
know
the
chimay
and
duvel
line
up
is
all
i
really
need
to
be
happy
they
can
get
a
little
rich
after
repeated
uses
but
thats
what
germany
was
made
for
im
trying
to
calm
myself
down
but
i
gotta
give
this
a
4
9
i
dont
believe
in
5s
either
just
as
their
is
no
10
in
women
but
i
truly
believe
that
with
as
high
an
abv
as
this
and
duvel
has
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
across
all
categories
and
im
hardly
buzzed
yet
well
maybe
a
little
this
ia
solid
tripel
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
flavorful
from
a
classic
its
enjoyable
balanced
and
clean
though
a
bit
boozy
i
enjoyed
it
but
ill
probably
seek
out
other
tripels
o
maybe
its
the
slight
bit
of
age
but
this
beer
is
much
more
impressive
than
the
first
time
i
tried
it
a
few
years
ago
delicious
fruity
tripel
that
doesnt
go
over
kill
on
the
spice
well
done
chimay
well
done
found
a
single
bottle
of
this
beer
to
buy
at
our
local
earth
fare
had
heard
the
all
the
hype
so
figured
i
had
to
try
it
my
son
in
law
had
just
come
back
from
a
tour
in
europe
and
had
been
to
belgium
on
numerous
occasions
chilled
in
fridge
for
a
day
then
let
it
warm
up
slightly
poured
well
into
a
snifter
i
had
read
the
alcohol
content
on
the
label
but
wowwas
not
expecting
such
a
strong
alcohol
taste
i
feel
it
is
a
shame
as
the
high
alcohol
detracts
from
the
beer
taste
and
aroma
almost
felt
as
if
i
were
drinking
whiskey
i
know
the
beer
snobs
out
there
will
poopoo
this
but
i
drink
beer
for
taste
more
than
for
alcohol
o
first
time
ive
had
this
in
years
and
wow
has
my
palette
changed
i
seem
to
remember
this
being
very
fruity
but
now
i
think
its
mildly
fruity
with
loads
of
grainy
yeast
nice
unique
and
complex
tripel
great
journey
of
balanced
flavors
i
think
very
drinkable
to
boot
o
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
can
remember
have
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
bar
none
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
baby
cost
me
7
bucks
for
a
bottle
it
better
be
good
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
produced
a
nice
white
head
and
left
behind
an
ample
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
grain
ripe
red
apples
and
yeast
mouthfeel
was
world
class
very
smooth
and
creamy
full
bodied
this
tripel
had
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
fruit
melody
of
apple
and
pear
honey
yeasty
and
strong
flavor
of
alcohol
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
with
that
bias
in
mind
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
one
to
seek
out
prost
fantastically
crafted
brew
not
really
super
impressed
with
this
but
its
ok
however
i
really
wish
it
had
retained
a
greater
measure
of
the
usual
banana
and
clove
spicing
aging
beer
is
truly
a
doubleedged
sword
the
next
time
i
try
aging
this
particular
beer
i
will
be
aiming
for
either
roughly
10
months
refrigerated
or
for
about
46
months
at
ambient
basement
temperature
to
see
if
i
can
get
even
closer
to
my
personal
palate
preferences
wasnt
completely
blown
away
not
even
with
the
aging
process
but
as
this
is
the
first
time
trying
this
beer
i
have
no
other
version
to
compare
it
to
i
can
imagine
that
fresher
its
also
hoppier
and
zestier
and
perhaps
more
to
my
liking
there
are
aforementioned
aspects
of
the
aging
process
that
i
particularly
enjoy
but
im
looking
forward
to
trying
it
fresh
as
it
is
a
creative
take
on
the
tripel
style
from
chimay
o
if
not
for
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
id
rate
this
close
to
5
its
not
at
all
the
pleasant
bitterness
you
get
from
ipas
o
a
nicely
balanced
beer
that
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
chimay
range
definitely
a
nice
tripel
although
there
are
better
ones
out
there
overall
well
made
beer
this
is
my
first
belgian
tripel
but
definitely
an
interesting
and
complex
experience
i
could
not
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
given
the
heaviness
but
very
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
a
solid
medium
bodied
beer
that
seems
to
get
better
as
it
warms
as
i
drink
this
cinq
cents
alone
while
watching
rory
mcilroy
wins
his
second
major
only
7
more
holes
rory
you
can
do
it
o
a
nice
authentic
tripel
lots
of
flavor
and
highly
drinkable
i
love
the
delicate
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
coming
from
a
guy
who
doesnt
really
care
for
tripels
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
it
and
i
will
likely
buy
and
drink
it
again
tripels
are
not
my
favorite
and
this
may
be
one
of
the
first
ive
had
that
i
really
liked
i
am
a
victim
of
style
bias
but
this
may
be
the
breakthrough
try
it
for
sure
dark
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
a
touch
of
apple
on
the
nose
and
tongue
grainy
and
dry
with
that
trademark
belgian
yeast
its
not
my
personal
favorite
style
of
beer
but
chimay
is
certainly
an
aromatic
tasty
tripel
which
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
o
an
extremely
good
offering
from
chimay
no
complaints
here
i
like
that
the
beer
does
have
some
complexity
to
it
offering
different
flavors
from
the
initial
hit
on
the
palate
to
the
finish
a
very
well
made
beer
definitely
worth
trying
the
beer
pours
like
peach
juice
and
piss
or
ice
tea
a
very
dark
brownish
orange
but
it
has
an
almost
ruby
pink
tinge
to
it
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
at
an
average
pace
and
leaves
a
thick
sloppy
lacing
that
forms
mountain
peaks
and
clouds
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
smells
bananalike
with
nice
bready
undertones
from
the
yeast
and
an
almost
lemonlike
smell
can
be
found
there
too
if
you
take
a
quick
whiff
you
might
also
detect
a
slight
trace
of
wet
dog
which
is
not
the
most
appealing
thing
to
smell
in
a
beer
but
that
is
not
overly
present
in
the
smell
the
smell
is
actually
quite
weak
for
what
i
was
hoping
for
nothing
is
really
prominent
but
i
suppose
ill
let
it
pass
since
this
isnt
really
a
floral
beer
it
tastes
like
tart
bananas
theres
also
some
nice
slight
spicing
that
gives
it
a
little
zest
there
is
almost
a
hops
bitterness
to
the
mouthfeel
though
the
beer
is
very
crisp
and
thicker
it
seems
very
cool
and
refreshing
for
a
summers
day
but
sits
a
little
heavy
in
the
stomach
as
most
belgians
seem
to
for
me
in
the
second
gulp
i
could
almost
swear
i
detected
hints
of
peach
in
the
flavor
but
that
may
be
because
i
said
it
looked
like
peach
juice
at
the
beginning
of
this
review
the
fruitiness
of
the
beer
is
definitely
present
however
and
leaves
a
nice
sweet
feeling
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
with
plenty
of
saliva
frothing
on
the
tongues
top
overall
this
seems
like
a
decent
tripel
i
havent
really
had
enough
beer
in
the
style
to
pass
actual
judgment
on
it
but
i
found
it
palatable
and
tasty
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
belgians
but
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
was
offered
it
golden
pour
thin
white
head
fine
lacing
typical
trippel
smell
though
nothing
too
prominent
taste
is
underwhelming
compared
to
all
ive
heard
about
this
being
an
excellent
brew
notes
of
banana
clove
wheat
and
a
touch
of
spice
tastes
like
a
slightly
weaker
and
more
bitter
st
bernardus
tripel
head
was
not
as
creamy
or
large
as
st
bernardus
either
im
willing
to
give
this
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
though
and
blame
it
on
an
old
keg
or
dirty
lines
but
overall
i
was
disappointed
compared
to
all
ive
heard
about
this
trappist
brew
originally
reviewed
07082011
overall
chimay
beers
are
both
good
and
drinkable
but
i
will
always
feel
they
are
overhyped
overall
aggressively
yeasty
comes
across
a
touch
unbalanced
and
suffers
for
it
nice
depth
of
flavor
with
a
solid
profile
but
its
ultimately
too
much
of
not
enough

that
is
quite

interesting
and
readily
available
nothing
mindblowing
just
super
solid
o
a
rather
disappointing
beer
im
questioning
the
fact
it
was
part
of
a
gift
pack
as
not
being
the
normal
quality
standard
the
chimay
dubbel
not
from
gift
pack
that
i
sampled
the
other
day
was
much
more
of
the
world
class
norm
i
expect
from
a
belgian
trappist
ale
this
beer
didnt
come
close
to
those
standards
overall
this
is
a
quality
tripel
theyre
not
may
favorite
style
and
im
sure
there
are
better
examples
of
it
but
she
is
tasty
none
the
less
and
super
accessible
a
good
choice
if
you
want
a
belgian
that
has
a
bit
more
to
it
then
a
pale
but
not
as
much
as
a
dubble
or
quad

poured
into
a
chalice
pours
hazy

with
a

there
was
some
sediment
in
the
bottle
the
aromas
are
of
belgian
yeast
malt
sugar
white
grape
spice
and
apple
its
definitely
an
excellent
smelling
tripel
the
taste
is
very
bready
with
some
back
end
bitterness
from
some
hops
there
is
some
sweetness
from
the
candied
sugar
and
the
fruity
and
yeast
flavors
really
come
thruogh
and
reflect
the
smells
there
is
some
mild
spiciness
as
well
its
very
complex
and
flavorful
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
the
body
is
medium
to
full
and
the
carbonation
is
very
lively
its
creamy
and
smooth
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
tripel
style
its
a
quality
beer
and
the
general
availability
of
chimay
beer
makes
this
one
easy
to
find
anyone
curious
about
this
style
cannot
go
wrong
with
this
beer
i
prefer
a
darker
beer
like
the
red
and
the
blue
dont
get
me
wrong
this
was
an
excellent
beer
for
what
it
was
but
its
just
not
my
style
of
beer
as
i
said
in
my
reviews
of
the
blue
and
the
red
my
favorite
has
tone
the
blue
i
just
prefer
daker
more
earthy
toned
beer
but
then
again
thats
what
i
like
and
everyone
has
their
right
to
their
opinion

22

i
am
on
a
tripel
run
this
belgian
style
a
pinnacle
of
brewing
for
some
has
lots
of
variety
in
the
offerings
it
was
time
for
me
to
sample
one
of
the
standards
the
chimay
the
chimay
has
the
appropriate
copper
color
which
is
pretty
clear
until
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
when
the
sediment
gets
stirred
up
a
good
sized
head
forms
on
top
which
i
consider
key
for
a
tripel
the
aroma
is
big
on
the
wonderful
belgian
yeast
that
makes
this
brew
possible
smooth
throughout
the
chimay
has
good
malt
flavors
accented
with
the
aromatic
yeast
lots
of
yeasty
and
bready
as
it
should
be
no
exotic
flavors
coming
through
this
is
the
working
mans
tripel
if
there
is
such
a
thing
o
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
with
a
very
nice
favor
but
certainly
not
something
that
you
would
want
for
a
session
beer
a
little
too
strong
in
the
abv
the
beer
is
really
quite
enjoyable
and
slightly
different
from
others
in
the
style
overall
a
great
authentic
tripel
nice
complexity
with
the
spicy
yeast
biscuit
malt
and
fruity
esters
overall
not
the
very
best
belgian
brew
i
have
ever
had
but
a
very
good
one
nonetheless
i
really
like
this
tripel
it
is
very
good
but
not
my
favorite
i
suggest
weyerbacher
or
unibroue
but
this
is
a
good
option
when
available
overall
impression
a
very
nice
brew
by
chimay
but
not
my
favorite
i
go
with
the
blue
quite
often
would
still
suggest
trying
if
available
will

the

the

dry
finish
this
is
a
great

o
a

of
tripels
i
have
had
come
across
with
way
to
full
of
a
mouthfeel
no
malt
characteristics
syrupy
too
candylike
but
this
tripel
has
opened
my
eyes
to
what
most
tripels
should
aspire
to
be
overall
this
is
a
real
solid
offering
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
chimay
offerings
ive
had
d
nice
enough
overall
this
was
very
good
d
i
like
this
one
though
if
i
have
it
again
id
like
to
have
it
on
tap
its
built
extremely
well
never
shows
its
abv
and
is
easy
drinking
overall
a
good
tripel
but
marred
by
the
excessive
carbonation
in
my
opinion
othis
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
i
prefer
chimay
red
but
this
is
very
good
as
well
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
still
like
this
alot
wouldnt
mind
this
again
on
occasion
worth
the
price
at
least
once
the
usual
adjectives
are
difficult
to
find
there
is
no
dominant
flavour
metaphor
term
to
describe
just
good
nay
great
beer
overall
it
is
probably
in
the
top
3
as
far
as
tripels
are
concerned
i
think
westmalle
is
the
best
but
this
is
right
there
with
it
a
world
class
beer
for
sure
o
a
well
balanced
triple
that
fails
to
wow
or
disappoint
all
the
same
while
this
was
easy
to
drink
it
wasnt
that
interesting
the
flavors
were
subdued
and
muted
the
spiciness
could
have
been
kicked
up
a
notch
the
banana
could
have
stuck
out
more
been
more
in
my
face
maybe
thats
just
not
their
thing
i
dont
know
but
ill
tell
you
one
thing
if
this
is
how
its
always
going
to
taste
then
ill
pass
hopefully
i
had
a
bad
batch
or
one
that
was
handled
improperly
odnot
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
tried
one
of
those
beers
i
cannot
believe
i
havent
tried
until
now
one
bottle
is
good
enough
for
me
but
theres
plenty
to
like
here
especially
if
youre
keen
on
the
triple
great
medium
body
that
was
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
o
it
was
good
but
for
the
price
there
are
other
really
good
beers
dare
i
say
better
beers
o
i
was
expecting
high
and
great
things
for
this
beer
i
was
impressed
by
the
mouthfeel
primary
taste
profile
and
the
aroma
but
i
think
it
needs
work
on
the
black
pepper
flavor
raisin
musky
taste
and
mouthfeel
overall
a
better
beer
than
youd
find
most
other
places
but
it
doesnt
even
hold
an
umbrella
for
the
chimay
red
or
other
trappist
beers
such
as
rochefort
6
10
westmalle
or
st
bernardus
a
good
beer
to
try
once
to
complete
the
chimay
trinity
i
will
revisit
this
in
corked
bottle
o
this
beer
is
heaven
for
a
yeast
lover
now
while
i
dont
consider
myself
one
of
those
i
did
enjoy
this
belgian
beauty
quite
a
bit
theres
not
much
else
you
can
say
for
a
trappist
ale
other
than
just
that
its
a
trappist
ale
its
complex
satisfying
and
still
drinkable
in
all
its
richness
o
this
would
be
a
better
warm
weather
beer
than
90
of
selfproclaimed
summer
beers
too
bad
i
drank
it
during
a
14
degree
snowstorm
in
february
between
the
red
white
and
blue
this
was
my
favorite
overall
great
session
tripel
and
a
really
excellent
example
ot
a
trappist
tripel
not
as
sweet
as
other
belgian
tripels
which
is
what
makes
this
a
unique
one
in
the
style
the
extra
hops
and
dry
profile
make
it
interesting
and
i
rank
it
highly
on
my
list
of
belgian
tripels
another
worldclass
beer
from
chimay
outstanding
doa
pours
a
clear
orange
gold
color
full
cap
of
prickly
white
bubbles
decent
retention
little
lacing
scent
leads
with
whiffs
of
light
fruit
and
sourdough
bread
minimal
sweetness
and
light
spices
taste
has
notes
of
apricot
pear
and
grape
sourdough
bread
brings
some
grain
and
tangyness
to
the
mix
yeast
brings
some
light
spice
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
lightly
bubbly
and
dry
finish
lighter
and
bubblier
than
many
in
the
style
but
still
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
classic
tripel
any
aficionado
of
the
style
should
have
this
one
on
hand
or
in
stock
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
lasting
medium
white
head
aroma
and
taste
is
of
some
light
ripe
fruit
belgium
yeast
some
biscuit
malt
a
nice
medium
body
with
a
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
on
the
palate
finishes
with
a
nice
light
ripe
fruit
flavor
some
belgium
yeast
and
biscuit
malt
ending
with
some
light
peppery
hops
overall
an
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
triple
obviously
a
legendary
tripel
overall
wife
says
this
is
a
drinking
beer
not
a
sipping
beer
its
perfect
for
a
hot
daybut
if
you
sip
this
beer
will
smack
you
with
its
hops
husband
says
crisp
and
refreshing
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
hops
this
is
one
of
the
more
hoppy
tripels
ive
had
so
be
ready
for
that
to
dominate
750
ml
bottle
pours
hazy
golden
hue
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
belgium
yeast
biscuit
malt
and
some
sour
notes
medium
smooth
body
flavors
are
a
boquet
of
belgium
yeast
peppery
hops
biscuit
malt
and
ripe
fruit
wonderful
brew
o
a
solid
tripel
with
tons
of
flavor
a
bit
drier
than
its
counterparts
worth
a
try
o
an
absolute
cracker
was
slightly
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
seems
to
adhere
to
the
style
well
but
not
really
impart
much
that
puts
it
above
the
rest
while
i
cannot
quite
identify
it
it
seems
to
be
lacking
something
giving
it
perfection
definitely
a
must
try
either
way
an
amazing
beer
that
follows
the
style
almost
too
strictly
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
prickly
carbonation
o
superb
belgian
tripel
a
little
high
on
the
carbonation
but
it
blends
in
nicely
with
the
yeast
and
hops
to
become
easily
drinkable
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
drink
well

chimay
just
havent
delivered
i
am
really
hoping
when
i
rebuy
a
blue
it
delivers
a
lot
better
ill
probably
come
back
to
a
large
format
as
i
hear
they
do
better
with
flavors
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
t
banana
clove
and
a
nice
dash
of
grassy
and
slightly
peppery
hops
alongside
some
nice
spiciness
really
tasty
stuff
i
need
to
get
this
more
often
nice
very
nice
one
of
the
finer
flavors
on
the
market
but
what
would
you
expect
from
monks
supersmooth
almost
lightbodied
for
the
strength
spicy
earthy
hopped
dry
finish
perfectly
balanced
and
very
drinkable
a
classic
well
crafted
belgian
gem
d
pretty
good
beer
overall
pretty
mild
flavor
and
i
didnt
love
the
alcoholspice
character
in
the
finish
but
then
again
im
not
really
a
fan
of
tripels
so
im
not
surprised
o
this
beer
has
been
my
gold
standard
for
tripel
if
you
like
belgian
beer
youll
love
this
one
it
never
fails
to
satisfy
the
alcohol
content
is
masked
well
so
be
warned
o
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
given
all
of
the
hype
and
the
overall
ratings
i
had
expected
a
bit
more
out
of
this
appearance
is
awesome
the
smell
is
pretty
good
the
taste
was
just
a
bit
above
average
o
two
thumbs
up
chimay
triple
picked
up
a
bottle
in
sicily
first
time
finding
this
poured
into
a
wine
glass
courtesy
of
disney
pours
about
two
fingers
of
off
white
head
and
is
a
cloudy
deep
goldenvery
bubbly
served
at
the
recommended
six
to
eight
centigrade
very
sweet
strong
fruity
example
of
a
triple
smells
like
a
floral
arrangement
with
a
somewhat
spivey
and
yeasty
frame
overall
a
decentrriple
but
abitspendy
would
definitely
seek
out
again
ojust
an
amazing
beer
the
complexity
and
craftsmanship
of
the
chimay
beers
astound
me
by
far
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
for
any
style
or
brewery
thebeeralmanac
com
i
dont
recommend
cellaringaging
this
it
doesnt
have
a
suitable
flavour
profile
enjoy
fresh
pairs
well
with
food
overall
fine
craftsmanship
yes
i
said
it
i
truly
love
what
chimay
has
done
with
this
beer
and
a
definite
keeper
like
most
chimays
cheers
to
all
and
drink
with
pride
overall
very
elegant
smooth
belgian
trippel
let
it
warm
a
bit
flavors
and
smoothness
come
in
even
stronger
my
wife
says
yum
happy
birthday
this
beer
goes
well
with
dvorak
or
debussey
piano
music
depends
on
your
taste
god
save
the
queen
i
prefer
listening
to
satie
overall
its
no
wonder
that
the
belgian
monastic
aficionados
would
consider
this
wondrous
beer
a
meal
on
its
own
there
are
so
many
complex
flavors
to
this
brew
without
being
overly
obvious
this
is
a
beer
that
took
me
a
while
to
decipher
given
its
subtle
characteristics
and
surreptitious
craftsmanship
lots
going
on
here
but
almost
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
hard
to
pinpoint
this
is
a
good
thing
and
it
seems
every
ingredient
added
deserves
its
place
once
again
i
am
left
amazed
by
another
astounding
beer
licensed
under
the
authentic
trappist
product
legacy
a
true
classic
overall
chimay
had
such
a
cache
for
me
when
i
first
started
into
the
craft
beer
scene
but
after
having
quite
a
few
great
belgians
and
trying
some
of
the
more
creative
american
styles
this
tripel
just
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
out
of
control
and
the
slight
metallic
flavor
towards
the
end
is
a
turn
off
as
well
at
this
point
there
are
a
few
readily
available
tripels
i
would
rather
have
o
overall
a
very
good
tripel
especially
for
the
price
and
availability
little
too
much
pepper
in
the
taste
for
me
but
something
id
certainly
drink
or
buy
again
if
im
looking
for
a
tripel
overall
drinkability
really
a
complex
beer
good
but
difficult
to
figure
out
what
all
im
drinking
here
for
all
i
have
heard
about
this
beer
i
can
say
it
is
good
but
ive
had
better
tripels
maybe
the
sediment
that
came
along
has
muddied
the
flavors
so
in
the
end
good
just
not
great
maybe
again
with
a
more
careful
pour
ill
get
a
different
beer
o
tasty
tripel
and
certainly
worth
picking
up
abv
is
noticeable
but
this
is
a
nice
sipper
and
would
be
enjoyed
by
any
fan
of
the
style
a
really
excellent
tripel
and
a
modicum
of
the
style
a
classic
beautiful
hazy
peach
colour
nice
carbonation
chimay
white
has
such
a
delicious
aroma
chocolate
spread
and
strawberries
on
crusty
toasted
bread
divine
the
only
thing
i
can
fault
in
the
flavour
is
its
slightly
tart
otherwise
its
a
toasty
biscuity
follow
through
on
the
smell
o
it
was
drawn
for
me
in
the
appropriate
glass
and
even
at
12
for
just
over
8
oz
i
loved
it
o
blasphemy
though
it
may
be
this
isnt
a
very
good
tripel
its
far
from
bad
but
has
a
watery
body
and
lacks
depth
of
flavor
o
a
really
great
beer
met
expectations
for
sure
while
it
may
not
be
the
most
flavorful
tripel
i
have
had
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
drinkable
o
i
expected
to
like
this
more
than
i
did
its
good
but
the
aromaflavors
dont
stand
out
very
complex
and
interesting
over
the
top
and
a
definite
sipper
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orange
half
a
finger
of
head
quickly
disappears
and
leaves
only
a
thin
white
ring
around
the
glass
smell
and
taste
are
of
fruit
spice
and
yeast
mostly
banannas
apples
clove
and
some
bread
mouthfeel
is
sharp
up
front
with
a
medium
body
lively
carbonation
and
a
long
dry
finish
overall
too
much
bananna
and
clove
for
me
in
another
beer
chimay
white
was
probably
the
first
tripel
i
ever
tasted
though
i
knew
little
about
belgian
beer
let
alone
the
style
at
that
time
revisiting
it
now
that
im
without
my
north
american
goto
tripels
from
unibroue
and
allagash
in
tokyo
makes
me
glad
that
i
can
get
this
at
the
local
supermarket
this
medium
weight
beer
tastes
sweet
from
malts
with
some
spiciness
and
very
light
esters
alcohol
warming
and
a
tart
dry
finish
with
some
herbal
hop
notes
this
beer
i
think
is
my
least
favorite
from
chimay
good
yes
but
nothing
special
like
in
the
red
and
blue
offerings
chimay
blanche
is
poured
from
a
750
ml
magnum
the
beer
is
quite
hazy
almost
dirty
a
robust
expansive
cap
of
foam
floats
above
the
duvel
tulip
in
which
it
sits
handsomely
showcases
the
beer
the
aroma
is
an
inviting
mixture
of
hops
and
yeast
the
fresh
hops
clear
the
passages
and
allow
the
imbiber
a
full
experience
this
tripel
has
a
deceptively
light
body
as
it
washes
the
mouth
yeast
and
fruit
on
the
palate
give
way
to
bitter
spicy
hops
raisins
and
apples
mix
wonderfully
with
the
grains
every
sip
reveals
a
slight
different
take
on
its
complexity
fruit
sweet
malt
yeast
spice
and
bitterness
are
all
in
harmony
at
the
end
the
palate
is
left
dry
and
bitter
but
i
for
one
wouldnt
have
it
any
other
way
the
standard
by
which
all
other
tripels
should
be
judged
deceptively
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
this
is
a
fairly
complex
and
very
delicious
brew
a
fine
sipper
for
the
winter
months
although
you
may
wonder
where
it
all
went
when
theres
an
empty
lacingcoated
glass
sitting
in
front
of
you
one
id
seriously
like
to
try
aged
some
day
d
a
good
introduction
to
tripels
that
i
think
everyone
should
try
due
to
its
wide
availability
o
very
nice
tripel
here
as
expected
pretty
drinkable
even
at
the
abv
it
may
not
be
the
best
out
there
but
its
better
then
most
enjoy
overall
a
great
beer
this
is
such
a
treat
and
a
delicious
experience
its
among
the
best
tripels
and
is
refreshing
and
complex
o
a
really
good
tripel
highly
drinkable
with
a
complex
taste
and
aroma
o
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
any
chimay
they
provide
wonderful
examples
for
the
styles
they
produce
and
this
one
is
no
exception
overall
excellent
beer
i
may
prefer
the
blue
label
chimay
but
this
one
is
very
nice
full
of
flavor
and
the
aromas
are
multidimensional
recommended
highly
over
all
just
an
easy
thumbs
up
a
great
abbey
tripel
this
is
a
gold
with
some
cloud
to
it
nice
for
this
type
of
brew
the
smell
is
good
with
that
hoppy
pils
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
and
leaves
nicely
taste
good
to
great
we
are
now
big
fans
of
this
beer
overall
we
think
this
is
a
must
have
beer
this
is
an
instant
classic
o
an
absolute
favorite
of
mine
slightly
bitting
but
nice
aftertaste
flavor
improves
as
it
warms
o
just
a
good
nice
round
beer
with
some
interesting
aspect
but
a
little
bit
to
smooth
pours
a
medium
golden
color
w
an
off
white
head
good
carbonation
and
lacing
in
the
chimay
goblet
fairly
light
nose
for
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
tripel
the
nose
is
yeast
spices
malt
clove
fairly
light
again
for
a
tripel
taste
is
the
same
profile
on
the
light
side
for
the
style
but
good
nonetheless
feel
is
very
carbonated
and
very
dry
this
beer
is
good
but
there
two
other
chimays
that
ar
better
the
grande
reserve
is
a
world
class
beer
and
the
dubbel
is
really
excellent
as
well
this
beer
is
good
but
not
what
i
expect
from
chimay
cheers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
high
in
carbonation
finishes
dry
with
a
little
bitterness
there
overall
a
great
beer
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
it
could
be
my
goto
just
love
the
way
everything
goes
together
and
the
refreshing
qualities
it
has
opaque
burnished
gold
with
ecru
foamy
1plus
finger
head
that
settles
to
a
cap
sediments
settle
out
initial
mild
aroma
increases
with
warming
earthy
browned
apple
and
peach
skin
plus
some
kind
of
herb
thyme
and
spice
cardamom
allspice
the
taste
is
fleeting
fruitiness
then
oak
woodiness
warming
alcohol
and
dryness
follow
not
really
good
but
not
bad
either
a
very
representative
tripel
great
tropical
fruit
flavor
and
really
solid
feel
worth
aging
to
see
if
the
slightly
aggressive
flavors
mellow
out
a
bit
cellar
this
one
now
the
flaw
of
other
chimay
beers
only
x10
this
beer
is
virtually
undrinkable
with
all
the
carbonation
a
solid
beer
but
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
definately
something
a
beer
fan
should
try
rjt
o
excellent
beer
i
definitely
cant
wait
to
drink
again
but
im
not
sure
how
it
would
be
coming
out
of
a
bottle
there
is
a
lot
to
enjoy
from
this
beer
so
i
definitely
suggest
a
goblet
food
match
i
would
match
this
with
a
dessert
because
the
sugars
in
this
are
quite
strong
which
dessert
your
choice
however
my
personal
favourites
are
tiramisu
or
a
lemon
curt
tart
cannoli
as
well
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
want
to
swim
naked
in
this
beer
o
one
of
my
old
time
favorites
although
i
might
like
it
better
on
tap
a
very
solid
tripel
but
not
the
best
a
trademark
of
the
style
though
and
everyone
should
try
this
definately
a
sipper
very
crisp
at
the
start
but
much
more
smooth
in
the
end
overall
very
goodtasting
brew
in
general
its
not
the
best
tripel
that
ive
tasted
but
its
still
a
good
example
o
a
drinkable
tripel
and
i
have
given
it
a
high
rating
but
what
was
surprising
to
me
was
that
the
taste
did
not
stand
out
as
much
as
the
other
chimay
beers
this
one
also
does
not
hide
the
high
abv
level
as
well
as
the
other
chimay
beers
9
a
750ml
othis
beer
seems
to
be
a
little
harsh
definitely
the
most
harsh
of
three
colors
the
taste
is
one
thing
but
the
mouthfeel
is
just
awful
its
definitely
a
good
beer
overall
but
there
are
many
better
other
tripels
out
there
that
make
me
want
to
not
waste
my
time
on
this
id
be
interested
in
trying
this
in
the
bottle
though
oexcellent
great
belgian
cant
wait
to
get
more
and
share
some
with
friends
d
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
and
would
never
turn
one
away
o
this
is
superb
chimay
white
is
an
amazing
beer
i
can
see
now
from
having
the
red
and
the
white
how
this
beer
has
earned
its
great
reputation
what
a
real
treat
this
one
was
o
this
a
great
beer
from
chimay
second
only
to
the
blue
on
that
note
lets
come
full
circle
and
cue
up
some
more
music
this
time
courtesy
of
madonna
louise
ciccone
like
a
virgin
tasted
for
the
very
first
time
that
or
the
convo
in
reservoir
dogs
when
they
dissected
the
song
that
might
be
more
appropriate
for
yours
truly
i
have
had
so
much
beer
that
for
something
to
capture
my
attention
this
way
it
must
be
spectacular
well
this
is
my
second
chimay
after
having
the
blue
multiple
times
this
one
is
much
more
lively
right
from
the
pour
an
explosive
head
of
bright
white
bubbles
reached
between
2
and
3
fingers
lively
bubble
reach
for
the
surface
of
this
light
golden
colored
body
unfortunately
im
just
slightly
congested
but
on
the
nose
hints
of
white
grape
are
coming
through
along
with
citrus
flavors
the
taste
comes
off
as
a
complex
mix
of
light
fruits
pears
citrus
grapes
mouth
feel
is
lively
like
champagne
all
in
all
an
outstanding
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
amazing
this
is
medium
bodied
finely
carbonated
has
a
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
and
goes
well
with
crab
cakes
o
good
i
guess
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
style
and
i
can
see
why
all
the
flavors
are
present
and
noticeable
but
nothing
is
overdone
or
forced
a
very
sippable
beer
o
you
cant
go
wrong
with
any
trappists
ive
ever
had
they
are
all
great
for
the
most
part
this
one
is
no
exception
it
was
a
lovely
experience
and
i
picked
it
up
at
my
local
krogers
grocery
which
is
nice
i
prefer
the
chimay
premiere
red
over
this
but
this
is
worth
to
try
i
find
myself
buying
the
red
cap
when
i
buy
chimay
however
the
cinq
cents
is
still
another
fine
brew
from
chimay
a
lovely
tripel
this
one
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
lacing
white
head
the
smell
is
full
of
spices
the
taste
is
very
bold
lots
of
spices
a
bit
of
corrinder
good
strong
flavor
very
nice
carbonation
overall
of
course
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
complex
flavoors
strong
bold
flavors
m
creamy
medium
bodied
beer
really
light
and
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
not
coming
through
except
for
maybe
a
hint
at
the
end
carbonation
is
really
nice
too
clears
the
palate
for
the
next
sip
just
excellent
o
perfect
example
of
a
tripel
excellent
summer
brew
balanced
very
nicely
would
drink
over
and
over
again
o
its
very
good
and
is
the
easiest
trappist
brand
to
find
d
i
could
see
drinking
this
to
excess
as
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
not
overpowering
in
any
capacity
solid
brew
had
this
one
on
tap
at
a
little
place
called
stephanies
in
doylestown
pa
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
heard
of
chimay
and
i
felt
like
trying
it
this
beer
poured
out
as
an
orangey
opaque
color
with
a
thin
white
fizzy
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
soft
and
floral
had
a
light
citrus
aroma
coming
off
of
it
too
the
taste
was
soft
and
had
a
citrus
flavor
that
faded
into
a
nice
refeshing
wheat
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
bubbly
overall
its
a
good
brew
overall
just
my
not
my
favorite
from
chimay
o
good
stuff
i
prefer
westmalle
however
for
the
win
very
dry
and
bitter
on
the
palate
which
is
a
good
thing
balances
the
yeast
flavors
well
either
the
bottle
shows
much
better
than
my
previous
taste
of
this
beer
on
tap
or
my
taste
has
changed
this
is
a
lovely
tripel
pours
a
yeast
hazy
deep
straw
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
down
to
a
thin
film
the
smell
is
of
sweet
yeast
esters
banana
bready
malts
earthy
good
the
feel
is
medium
with
plenty
of
carbonation
the
initial
taste
is
of
spice
some
banana
and
bready
malts
with
a
little
dryness
on
the
end
overall
a
good
and
tasty
brew
from
chimay
o
overall
a
good
beer
for
a
relaxing
day
if
you
have
no
plans
other
than
hanging
out
and
enjoying
some
good
beer
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
and
break
out
some
nice
cheese
and
crackers
with
some
pepperoni
yum
drink
45
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
great
brew
but
perhaps
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
great
beer
fruity
dry
hoppy
and
crisp
this
beer
could
go
from
summer
time
evenings
to
elegant
dinner
pairings
absolutely
world
class
d
high
would
have
had
another
one
right
after
this
if
id
had
it
there
are
certain
belgian
beers
that
i
love
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
them
it
pours
with
a
rich
beautiful
head
and
has
an
inviting
flowery
aroma
but
i
find
it
too
sour
and
bitter
the
taste
isnt
too
different
from
letting
a
vitamin
c
tablet
melt
in
your
mouth
throw
in
some
yeast
flavors
and
you
get
the
picture
this
beer
pours
a
yellowish
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
a
little
spicey
and
slightly
bready
the
taste
seems
muted
it
is
definitely
a
tripel
just
not
a
particularly
good
one
allagash
and
unibrou
make
far
better
beers
than
chimays
tripel
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbed
overall
a
good
beer
just
not
a
great
one
i
was
undewhelmed
by
this
one
its
humbling
to
critic
such
a
great
beerhoweveri
have
to
say
the
appearance
matches
the
smell
not
so
good
a
little
dirty
odorand
alcohol
more
than
malt
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
suprise
compared
to
color
and
odor
the
alcohol
does
deprive
my
tastebuds
of
the
other
ingredientsbut
its
still
good
some
fruitymaltyand
sweetness
squirts
out
during
my
consumptionit
still
leaves
me
to
want
another
sip
overall
goodbut
it
makes
me
want
to
experiment
with
other
triple
labels
not
a
homey
this
beer
pours
a
bit
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
clingy
white
head
the
aroma
is
moderatehigh
spicy
floral
esters
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
like
malt
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
but
balanced
out
by
spicy
hops
peppery
phenols
and
mediumlow
hop
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
a
fine
beer
and
a
must
try
m
fairly
carbonated
had
a
dry
feel
slight
chalky
feel
upon
aftertaste
overall
this
a
fantastic
beer
dare
i
say
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
style
very
well
done
750ml
bottle
purchased
at
shaws
in
north
hampton
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenamber
with
a
good
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
a
bit
more
quickly
than
expected
very
fruity
nose
with
apple
banana
peach
and
raisin
coming
through
and
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
fruit
hits
the
palate
first
too
with
grape
and
apple
skin
banana
and
raisin
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
caramel
play
a
big
role
in
the
flavor
too
effervescent
and
light
bodied
which
combined
with
the
pleasant
flavor
makes
this
one
dangerously
drinkable
not
at
all
what
i
expected
excellent
truly
unique
o
a
good
tripel
perhaps
the
most
notable
aspect
of
this
beer
is
how
well
balanced
it
is
the
floral
hops
profile
is
refreshing
and
balances
the
more
malty
nature
of
this
beer
perhaps
not
as
recognized
as
the
other
chimays
but
its
a
tasty
beer
and
also
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
o
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
a
chimay
beer
just
great
stuff
all
in
all
a
great
beer
good
for
the
summer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
nice
tripel
but
not
close
to
westmalle
st
bernardus
and
karmeliet
is
just
a
bit
too
unbalanced
and
alcoholic
lacks
the
body
but
nevertheless
a
good
beer
overall
this
was
a
great
beverage
would
have
again
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
one
to
one
and
half
finger
white
head
which
gives
way
to
a
tight
ring
there
is
also
moderate
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
candies
along
with
cloves
and
bananas
the
taste
starts
out
up
front
with
a
candy
yeast
strain
along
with
some
fruits
bananas
and
clove
play
out
briefly
about
half
way
through
you
get
a
big
bitter
hop
bite
it
is
earthy
in
tone
the
bitterness
carries
you
through
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
moderately
carbonated
overall
the
beer
was
interesting
it
was
much
different
from
what
i
expected
the
malts
and
sweetness
where
more
subdued
than
i
thought
was
going
to
be
the
case
there
is
a
much
bigger
hop
bitterness
than
alot
of
the
class
after
rereading
the
style
profile
though
it
was
very
close
to
being
on
par
interesting
for
the
style
but
nowhere
near
as
smooth
as
a
le
trappe
tripel
for
example
the
taste
is
complex
with
swirling
flavors
of
lemon
rind
a
pleasant
blend
of
somewhat
bitter
hops
a
nice
heft
from
the
alcohol
and
a
unique
strand
of
belgian
yeast
that
all
combine
into
one
big
and
bold
flavor
profile
the
lemon
rind
flavor
hits
first
immediately
followed
by
hops
that
frame
the
fruity
flavor
and
an
overlying
alcohol
taste
that
binds
it
all
together
it
finishes
dry
and
gritty
from
the
hops
and
booze
but
the
aftertaste
keeps
on
giving
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
astounding
making
every
sip
a
craft
beer
lovers
delight
definitely
one
to
check
out
from
a
33cl
bottle
best
before
2014
pours
a
rich
golden
copper
slightly
cloudy
persistent
fine
white
foam
lovely
colour
fine
aromas
of
dried
fruits
citrus
and
herbs
nice
clean
malt
aromas
also
sublime
mouthfeel
with
very
fine
champagnelike
bubbles
fruity
flavours
citrus
pine
a
bit
metallic
with
some
unnecessary
sweetness
overall
very
nice
ive
bought
this
one
several
times
and
will
continue
to
do
so
very
elegant
trappist
beer
i
am
glad
that
the
red
isnt
on
the
list
hold
on
though
let
me
go
back
to
the
sweetness
i
am
experiencing
here
yeah
thats
it
the
beer
just
lacks
on
so
many
levels
its
better
than
a
domestic
but
thats
about
as
far
as
i
would
go
i
just
heard
sheryl
say
this
is
what
a
domestic
beer
tastes
like
in
a
foreign
country
i
would
have
to
agree
even
though
i
didnt
like
it
doesnt
mean
you
wont
just
not
for
me
d
probably
the
best
tripel
ive
had
an
all
around
fantastic
brew
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
staple
brew
o
a
wonderful
belgian
beer
and
i
always
enjoy
drinking
the
beer
from
the
trappist
monasteries
it
is
no
wonder
this
is
a
world
famous
brew
d
kinda
disappointed
in
this
one
very
bitter
and
so
much
earthy
clay
there
is
not
much
else
to
it
this
is
pretty
good
tripel
it
smells
pretty
fruity
with
a
little
chestnut
i
taste
a
little
bit
of
smoke
with
just
a
slight
fruitiness
the
beer
has
a
pretty
color
which
ranges
from
light
yellow
to
light
orange
when
i
poured
it
the
head
was
medium
size
but
quickly
dissipated
it
goes
down
very
smooth
with
no
bite
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
overall
i
give
this
beer
a
pretty
good
grade
its
a
great
summer
belgian
option
due
to
its
relative
refreshing
qualities
it
seems
to
be
slightly
more
hoppy
than
the
red
blue
but
i
will
be
rating
them
very
soon
so
my
memory
will
be
refreshed
anyhowhuh
not
really
sure
how
to
review
this
now
it
was
very
well
brewed
at
any
rate
regardless
of
style
it
started
off
with
nodes
of
honey
and
caramel
which
become
spicier
in
the
middle
before
finally
getting
washed
away
by
a
pleasantly
aggressive
belgian
yeast
that
was
a
combination
of
sour
and
spice
nodes
owell
balanced
well
made
beer
not
the
best
triple
i
have
had
i
would
probably
put
it
behind
the
st
bernardus
and
the
la
fin
due
monde
but
a
very
worth
while
beer
final
notes
a
solid
tripel
with
good
flavor
just
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
and
i
can
think
of
a
few
tripels
that
are
less
expensive
but
better
than
this
one
nonetheless
good
stuff
poured
a
massive
cream
colored
head
which
dissipated
to
lacing
light
caramel
or
gold
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
i
can
smell
malt
but
not
much
else
later
after
it
warmed
i
could
smell
a
hint
of
spice
too
but
not
the
banana
some
have
claimed
but
maybe
thats
just
how
my
sample
turned
out
taste
has
malt
and
salt
theres
a
medium
richness
indicating
a
tripel
but
ive
had
richer
finish
is
a
moderate
length
so
all
in
all
a
good
tripel
from
a
world
class
place
but
not
the
king
of
tripels
o
good
stuff
and
unique
un
to
its
own
right
however
i
feel
this
is
over
priced
and
generally
overrated
this
beer
opens
up
nicely
a
really
good
tripel
its
quite
a
bit
different
than
many
of
the
american
versions
ive
had
recently
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
color
with
orange
highlights
has
a
2
finger
fluffy
white
foamy
head
which
dissipates
fairly
quickly
no
lacing
aroma
of
malt
and
yeast
dominate
with
floral
and
hoppy
notes
and
very
light
hints
of
fruit
malt
flavor
up
front
with
a
hints
of
baked
bread
in
the
middle
finishes
with
a
bit
of
bitter
lemon
zest
mediumbodied
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
up
front
dry
finish
fairly
high
drinkability
for
a
beer
with
an
abv
of
8
overall
its
not
something
id
seek
out
but
wouldnt
object
to
trying
again
in
the
future
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
well
i
have
enjoyed
both
chimays
red
and
blue
i
enjoyed
this
far
more
highly
recommended
especially
for
those
looking
for
a
spicier
tripel
as
i
have
had
the
red
chimay
before
i
was
quite
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
am
willing
to
try
it
again
sometime
under
the
assumption
that
this
bottle
may
not
have
been
at
its
peak
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
spicy
yeasty
flavor
with
some
citrus
and
hop
notes
and
is
balanced
very
well
o
excellent
tripel
very
well
balanced
the
brew
poured
a
hazy
blonde
looking
a
little
unfiltered
at
8
i
really
did
not
seem
8
i
could
taste
a
furity
earthy
mix
sweet
but
dry
finish
all
in
all
another
great
trappiste
not
diappointed
at
all
and
would
like
to
try
another
at
anytime
oh
yeah
that
reminds
me
i
bought
a
4pack
so
i
have
3
left
wow
i
guess
the
8
really
was
there
cheers
and
enjoy
everyone
o
why
so
dry
chimay
i
was
really
digging
the
taste
upfront
but
then
you
hit
me
with
a
dryness
that
was
like
a
desert
the
initial
taste
is
truly
beautiful
and
a
shame
to
be
followed
with
the
over
dryness
wish
i
could
put
3
75
here
incredibly
soft
and
smooth
solid
if
not
spectacular
as
chimay
seems
to
be
across
the
board
overall
an
outstanding
brew
but
one
of
these
at
a
time
is
enough
o
a
delightfully
well
balanced
beer
a
nice
middle
ground
between
light
hoppy
beers
and
heavier
beers
with
emphasis
on
the
malts
im
a
fan
overall
as
stated
tasty
but
not
complex
enough
to
earn
the
highest
marks
still
a
nice
beer
to
find
on
tap
hazy
orange
thick
white
head
fluffy
nice
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
yeasty
lemon
slightly
hoppy
fresh
bread
spicy
notes
banana
and
candy
taste
is
dry
and
yeasty
lemon
nice
bitterness
is
present
leafy
hops
light
alcohol
bread
very
complex
but
balanced
medium
weight
high
carbonation
that
is
nice
but
not
too
much
nice
dry
finish
outstanding
stuff
here
world
class
and
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
this
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
on
the
higher
side
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
and
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
very
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
altogether
it
is
a
nice
and
pleasant
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
together
with
a
piece
of
meat
at
supper
but
it
isnt
a
brew
im
especially
impressed
by
id
say
if
anything
the
flavors
are
a
little
underwhelming
but
i
think
light
is
a
more
appropriate
word
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
perfect
alternative
to
the
tripel
karmeliet
given
the
price
and
the
similarity
although
the
tripel
is
a
bit
more
citrusy
and
less
yeasty
recommend
without
reservations
what
i
love
the
most
is
the
fact
that
its
unfiltered
with
nice
little
bits
of
yeast
and
god
knows
what
next
year
im
fasting
and
drinking
nothing
but
chimay
for
lent
overall
a
more
than
great
trappistes
ale
that
deserves
to
be
in
the
world
class
of
beers
a
very
nice
taste
that
reminds
me
of
offerings
from
unibroue
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
in
the
future
overall
the
alcohol
on
this
beer
was
extremely
well
hidden
and
it
was
going
down
fast
its
not
my
favourite
tripel
but
its
a
great
beer
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
alot
of
honey
flavor
to
me
but
still
very
balanced
enjoyed
the
other
2
chimays
better
but
for
a
triple
this
is
a
great
beer
and
would
enjoy
tryin
this
on
draft
someday
overall
got
to
say
i
liked
this
more
than
i
though
i
would
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
its
full
of
flavor
and
isnt
all
that
dry
a
well
balanced
beer
living
up
too
the
hype
that
it
comes
with
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
great
must
taste
beer
very
nice
balanced
beer
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
triples
ive
had
pairs
well
with
a
range
of
lighter
food
recommend
poured
a
cloudy
light
golden
color
with
a
good
amount
of
tight
white
head
on
it
fruity
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
slightly
alcohollike
taste
on
the
finish
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
goes
down
pretty
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
d
very
good
obviously
probably
my
favorite
of
the
chimay
offerings
high
abv
takes
this
category
down
a
bit
but
altogether
a
great
beer
o
pretty
good
dont
have
many
tripels
to
compare
it
to
but
its
classically
belgian
sweet
spicy
a
tad
funky
and
overall
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
had
in
a
750ml
in
a
goblet
pours
a
hazy
gold
somewhere
between
honey
and
maple
syrup
for
shade
a
bubbly
white
fluffy
head
a
little
more
than
a
thumbnail
resides
but
doesnt
stick
around
for
the
party
smells
of
floral
alcohol
and
fruit
the
taste
is
spicy
with
a
nice
burst
of
white
flesh
fruit
and
classic
belgian
character
a
hint
of
alcohol
melds
well
with
everything
and
brings
out
more
apple
as
i
delve
further
towards
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
very
drinkable
the
8
is
nearly
invisible
the
mouth
feel
is
like
having
my
tongue
wrapped
in
billowing
silk
think
malls
cabbage
if
youve
ever
had
it
it
has
that
soft
characteristic
to
it
this
is
dangerous
all
in
all
this
continues
to
prove
that
anything
brewed
by
a
monk
truly
is
heavenly
overall
a
great
beer
not
my
favourite
tripel
but
a
great
example
of
the
style
without
a
doubt
drink
interesting
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
and
not
too
heavy
a
world
class
tripel
o
a
wonderful
tripel
that
is
everything
you
would
expect
from
the
style
i
would
recommend
this
one
for
sure
d
great
drink
i
wouldnt
waste
this
everyday
this
is
for
special
times
only
despite
high
abv
there
is
little
hint
of
it
its
a
good
beer
but
only
slightly
drinkable
due
to
its
high
acidity
and
cleansing
bite
d
maybe
just
a
bad
bottle
but
this
really
was
meh
i
have
had
it
a
few
times
and
enjoyed
it
this
was
not
that
great
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
this
brewery
so
i
will
re
review
this
again
o
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
loaded
with
flavor
and
none
of
the
alcohol
level
present
a
brilliant
trappist
o
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
up
until
this
point
it
encapsulates
everything
that
i
love
about
a
beer
and
does
not
dissapoint
if
i
could
drink
this
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
would
its
just
that
good
2
thumbs
waaayyyy
uppp
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
for
the
session
drinker
it
is
a
big
beer
but
you
wouldnt
know
it
unless
you
read
the
label
a
prototypical
tripel
and
great
night
cap
the
high
alcohol
content
is
masked
by
the
complex
taste
of
this
beer
a
beer
that
is
made
to
be
enjoyed
pours
a
murky
apple
cider
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
1
inch
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
yeast
spices
banana
orange
peel
caramel
taste
is
very
yeasty
all
around
sweet
malt
dried
fruits
and
spices
on
the
finish
there
is
a
herballike
bitterness
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
carbonation
level
is
good
very
crisp
drinking
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
sip
by
sip
d
very
enjoyable
but
unusual
tripel
i
highly
recommend
it
very
nice
beer
i
would
buy
chimmay
by
the
case
if
it
wasnt
so
dam
expensive
d
yes
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
look
is
yellow
with
a
murky
hue
and
a
lot
of
grain
pours
with
a
lot
of
head
but
has
a
great
smell
of
fruit
to
it
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
little
after
taste
a
very
simple
but
great
tasting
beer
i
would
suggest
this
beer
as
an
after
dinner
drink
cheers
the
cpj
golden
color
beer
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
massive
and
it
sticks
like
crazy
to
the
glass
wow
good
looking
beer
aroma
is
so
good
exotic
fruits
with
some
bananas
yeast
presence
awesome
aroma
taste
is
fruity
it
taste
lightly
of
apples
and
citrus
very
good
warms
due
to
the
high
alcohol
level
drinkability
is
high
for
this
beer
even
though
it
is
8
abv
a
nice
tripel
overall
an
absolutely
tasty
trappist
ale
that
lets
the
fruit
and
malts
blend
together
ever
so
perfectly
it
is
as
i
would
call
it
a
very
nice
relaxing
sipper
excellent
example
of
a
tripel
tasty
and
refreshing
alcohol
is
well
disguised
d
i
dont
usually
drink
this
style
but
chimay
was
good
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
the
8
abv
is
completely
hidden
gorgeous
pour
with
enormous
rocky
white
head
hazy
peach
colored
body
and
just
overall
very
enticing
nose
has
a
rusty
bready
quality
with
some
peach
pit
and
clove
notes
with
a
pleasant
mustiness
dry
on
the
palate
with
some
soft
wheat
like
maltiness
bready
qualities
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
d
drinkable
and
delicious
lots
of
flavor
it
drinks
like
hefe
to
me
it
is
pricey
so
i
dont
buy
it
to
often
overall
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
easily
available
chimay
brews
but
i
still
love
it
d
a
sipper
from
the
strength
this
is
a
beer
for
those
that
like
the
lingering
taste
of
bitterness
in
their
beer
its
just
not
my
favorite
drinkability
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
another
one
of
these
and
i
think
theyre
overpriced
and
overrated
however
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
very
solid
offering
here
that
i
would
have
no
issues
with
enjoying
again
i
would
love
to
get
another
bottle
as
it
really
seems
to
have
some
legs
lovely
golden
color
with
nice
white
lacing
smells
of
hop
and
belgian
yeast
with
some
malt
backbone
ample
carbonation
tastes
of
hop
yeast
malt
and
orange
drinkability
is
high
and
the
mouthfeel
high
as
well
very
nice
would
definitly
revisit
solid
example
of
a
triple
i
am
a
big
fan
of
chimay
across
the
board
i
much
more
often
drink
the
red
and
blue
but
that
is
mostly
because
the
white
is
less
available
and
not
due
to
any
strong
preference
a
bit
pricier
than
some
other
options
in
the
style
but
when
i
want
a
sure
bet
for
a
well
and
consistently
crafted
abbey
ale
this
would
be
my
choice
drinkability
pretty
nice
the
alcohol
is
present
but
in
a
therapeutic
way
indulge
the
alcohol
is
a
little
present
but
this
pour
is
still
very
drinkable
another
great
belgian
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
twofinger
cloudy
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
pears
apples
and
belgian
yeast
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
to
start
the
flavor
profile
followed
by
the
belgian
spices
before
tailing
off
to
a
sweeter
pearapple
finish
highly
carbonated
crisp
tingling
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
delicious
and
it
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
an
excellent
tripel
oh
those
crazy
belgian
monks
a
classic
to
be
enjoyed
those
who
want
to
experience
as
close
to
a
perfect
bottle
of
beer
as
humanly
possible
i
am
starting
to
think
the
monks
had
some
devine
inspiration
with
the
recipe
m
bubbly
tickles
the
mouth
lots
of
carbonation
d
i
would
probably
try
a
new
triple
over
this
but
would
buy
this
again
if
there
were
no
other
triples
or
if
the
set
with
the
glassware
were
available
enjoyed
ontap
at
black
dog
in
urbana
il
chimay
white
is
a
beer
drinkers
beer
great
feeling
when
that
glass
hits
my
hand
the
taste
is
full
yet
not
to
filling
glad
to
see
such
a
classy
beer
in
so
many
bars
i
feel
that
not
enough
people
treat
themselves
to
a
nice
beer
if
chimay
is
the
only
one
next
to
a
miller
light
or
coors
light
i
will
gladly
choose
chimay
drinkability
is
solid
i
could
sip
on
this
all
day
chimay
triple
was
orange
in
color
and
very
cloudy
it
had
a
nice
creamy
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
yeast
aromas
fruit
and
peppery
spices
the
taste
was
spice
yeast
candi
sugar
and
a
little
fruit
with
some
noticeable
alcohol
the
finish
was
dry
and
warming
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
that
mellows
as
the
beer
warms
drinkability
was
good
as
well
this
is
a
well
made
tripel
and
worth
trying
out
d
its
a
tasty
beer
and
the
8
0
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
in
the
taste
at
all
it
makes
it
a
drinkable
beer
obviously
its
not
a
beer
you
want
to
session
but
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
the
chalice
is
pretty
cool
though
d
a
really
drinkable
beer
perhaps
my
favorite
of
the
chimays
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
unfortunately
it
isnt
sitting
very
well
so
it
suffers
on
the
drinkability
scale
someone
with
stronger
stomach
might
be
able
to
handle
more
than
one
of
these
and
the
8
abv
really
creeps
up
on
you
definitely
worth
a
taste
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
you
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
and
it
drinks
very
easily
but
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
pretty
easy
and
straightforward
for
drinkability
although
for
drinkability
i
would
prefer
something
much
bolder
in
taste
and
bouquet
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
i
have
drank
it
alot
before
and
unfortunately
the
wow
factor
is
gone
by
now
but
still
an
amazing
beverage
d
its
real
tasty
and
the
8
is
nowhere
to
been
seen
a
classic
delicious
brew
thats
always
worth
coming
back
to
this
is
one
of
the
best
tripels
out
there
everyone
likes
to
focus
on
the
chimay
blue
and
that
beer
rocks
but
this
little
nugget
is
a
worthy
addition
to
any
collection
a
must
try
for
anyone
into
belgian
beer
d
this
is
very
drinkable
but
it
would
be
nice
with
something
to
eat
drinkability
is
so
so
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
but
this
is
the
first
time
from
a
small
bottle
11
2oz
maybe
i
am
crazy
but
this
beer
tastes
better
from
a
750ml
bottle
d
this
is
a
sipper
i
dont
even
need
to
drink
it
i
would
be
happy
to
just
keep
my
nose
in
a
glass
of
this
for
a
while
do
i
see
myself
buying
this
beer
on
a
consistent
basis
no
only
because
the
price
is
in
range
as
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
which
i
feel
is
a
superior
beer
chimay
white
is
definitely
worth
the
try
and
is
better
than
most
beers
out
there
but
its
not
an
elite
beer
cheers
overall
this
was
an
ok
triple
i
feel
as
if
the
age
of
this
bottle
may
have
held
it
back
and
it
would
be
far
less
sour
and
acidic
if
it
was
fresher
i
really
love
this
style
and
will
for
sure
revisit
this
beer
to
see
what
its
really
like
drinkability
a
good
tripel
but
not
chimays
best
to
offer
worth
a
try
but
imo
very
much
inferior
to
blue
and
red
maybe
im
being
to
harsh
but
the
way
this
brew
finishes
just
left
me
wanting
d
expensive
but
not
bad
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
on
tap
at
a
pub
even
4
overall
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
but
not
my
favorite
it
is
fruity
spicy
dry
and
strong
just
as
a
tripel
should
be
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
is
a
world
class
trappist
belgian
ale
which
i
would
drink
it
all
night
if
i
could
afford
to
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
the
beginning
but
finishes
dry
which
helps
cut
down
on
perceived
sweetness
drinkability
is
pretty
high
as
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
a
classic
solid
example
of
a
tripel
d
overall
chimay
white
is
a
solid
tripel
that
is
worth
trying
white
comes
out
gold
and
with
a
tint
of
hazy
yellow
and
a
nice
creamy
white
head
about
an
inch
up
nice
streaks
of
lace
here
and
there
smell
is
fruity
esters
pear
grape
belgian
yeast
breadearthy
hops
triple
this
might
be
one
of
the
better
trips
ive
had
in
a
while
everything
comes
through
fruit
is
up
front
followed
by
the
yeast
bringing
on
to
a
dry
and
refreshing
finish
of
both
this
one
pulls
no
punches
its
a
triple
in
every
sense
of
the
word
body
is
bold
and
a
big
medium
not
thin
or
watery
feeling
like
alot
of
american
versions
alcohol
comes
out
a
bit
and
warms
things
up
a
bit
highly
carbed
highly
good
i
highly
recommend
this
one
id
consider
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable
it
doesnt
taste
like
an
8
beer
and
the
bright
tangy
quality
allows
it
to
be
quaffed
with
ease
overall
i
am
very
satisfied
with
my
first
ever
authentic
trappist
ale
highly
recommended
for
any
beer
lover
this
is
a
quite
tasty
yet
charmingly
simple
very
drinkable
ale
whose
number
ill
always
keep
listed
for
cheap
thrills
and
belgian
booty
calls
i
havent
had
very
many
examples
of
this
style
but
this
would
be
the
smoothest
and
most
well
balanced
example
i
have
had
thus
far
its
smell
has
belgian
yeast
peach
some
hops
candy
taste
has
more
fruit
some
apple
malts
some
caramel
mf
is
creamy
with
solid
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
for
this
tripel
this
offering
from
chimay
has
long
been
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
murky
goldenorange
with
a
cloudy
appearance
strands
of
sparkling
carbs
making
their
way
up
to
the
top
making
for
a
nice
white
head
with
a
lasting
presence
although
little
lacing
occurred
aromas
of
vanilla
citrus
yeast
with
a
slight
grassyhay
presence
as
well
taste
was
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
nice
sparkling
mouthfeel
this
brew
featured
natural
yeasty
characteristics
and
a
nice
mellow
hop
bitterness
with
a
citrusy
aftertaste
dry
and
biscuity
with
no
alcohol
noticeable
overall
a
solid
well
balanced
tripel
no
complaints
here
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
it
is
not
the
best
tripel
i
have
had
but
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
d
a
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
offering
from
chimay
still
this
is
enjoyable
and
worth
buying
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
funky
aspects
of
the
taste
while
it
looked
fantastic
with
insane
gripping
lace
and
had
a
traditional
aroma
there
was
an
inclusion
of
bitter
citrus
this
could
have
come
in
portion
from
the
hops
but
it
is
different
and
more
bitterly
fruity
than
hoppy
while
many
triples
will
have
hints
of
orange
or
lemon
this
brew
took
it
to
a
whole
new
level
with
an
interesting
bitterness
that
actually
helped
make
the
beer
more
drinkable
rather
than
what
could
have
been
overly
sweet
and
bready
very
well
balanced
and
a
tasty
tripel
d
very
nice
big
mallty
flavors
and
very
smooth
not
too
boozy
o
this
is
in
my
top
3
of
tripels
its
a
juggernaut
of
a
beer
and
is
my
favorite
offering
from
chimay
the
beer
keeps
getting
better
as
it
warms
really
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
get
disappointed
when
you
realize
its
gone
i
definitely
visit
this
beer
at
least
once
a
week
if
i
can
drinkabilty
i
sipped
this
one
and
at
first
though
it
was
too
weak
then
after
warming
up
some
the
flavors
still
light
came
out
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
8
either
i
still
like
la
fin
du
monde
better
but
this
is
easy
to
drink
may
have
gotten
a
5
if
it
wasnt
8
drinkabilty
not
overpowering
light
crisp
and
clean
well
balanced
and
blended
brew
very
drinkable
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
the
beer
pours
a
cloudyhazy
golden
straw
color
it
has
a
soft
fluffy
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
the
nose
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
floral
hops
in
the
background
there
are
pineapples
and
some
banana
upfront
with
a
mild
breadybuiscuity
middle
then
the
nose
fades
to
a
spicy
clove
finish
taste
is
sweet
and
has
a
dominant
clove
spiciness
again
there
is
a
yeasty
bready
character
in
the
middle
it
then
goes
into
a
clean
hops
finish
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
excellent
well
carbonated
but
very
smooth
and
creamy
it
sits
very
well
on
the
palate
this
is
some
good
stuff
right
here
very
enjoyable
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
good
thing
they
sell
750s
of
this
stuff
at
my
local
supermarket
d
an
enjoyable
tripel
for
sure
great
balance
and
harmony
of
flavor
components
didnt
really
expect
less
from
chimay
solid
beer
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
a
bit
over
carbonated
for
my
taste
and
fairly
dry
i
prefer
the
larger
bottles
readily
available
nice
to
know
you
can
depend
on
this
trappist
ale
dincredibly
drinkable
although
it
has
a
high
abv
its
quite
easy
to
throw
these
back
a
fantastic
brew
everyone
should
try
md
very
smooth
soft
mouthfeel
despite
the
high
level
of
carbonation
highly
drinkable
beer
deceptively
smooth
for
abv
could
go
down
a
little
to
easy
fans
of
belgian
tripel
style
beer
should
consider
this
a
musttry
chmiay
white
is
one
of
the
best
the
mouthfeel
is
active
very
well
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
one
beer
its
a
sipper
and
a
great
one
at
that
overall
a
really
good
looking
glass
of
beer
i
wish
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
a
little
more
to
my
liking
i
will
try
it
again
in
a
few
months
to
see
if
i
have
a
different
opinion
i
would
like
to
try
the
other
colors
blue
red
d
tasty
not
too
strong
or
overpowering
for
a
tripel
highly
drinkable
d
very
easy
drinking
triple
very
flavorful
yet
not
over
the
top
complex
glorious
golden
orange
emerges
in
my
glass
with
three
fingers
of
billowing
white
head
tons
of
suspended
yeast
here
make
it
opaque
chunky
lace
and
the
carbonation
is
evident
from
looks
alone
nose
is
of
banana
pear
light
spice
taste
follows
tons
of
fruit
banana
again
pear
green
apple
finish
is
super
dry
and
yeasty
high
carbonation
and
a
good
body
great
drink
for
the
abv
if
not
somewhat
restricted
by
how
uncomfortably
parched
the
palate
is
left
after
each
sip
id
still
take
la
fin
du
monde
over
this
i
get
more
then
twice
the
triple
when
i
grab
a
750ml
bottle
of
la
fin
du
monde
i
like
this
beer
but
its
hard
buy
when
its
beside
lfdm
on
the
shelf
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
received
in
the
gift
pack
very
bubbly
and
orange
with
a
nice
sized
head
that
subsides
quickly
typical
smell
of
belgian
tripel
yeasts
slightly
bitter
in
the
taste
with
the
flavor
of
the
yeast
the
taste
of
hops
is
surprisingly
present
in
this
if
only
ever
so
tiny
slight
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
tongue
despite
the
thin
mouthfeel
not
my
favorite
tripel
or
chimay
offering
but
solid
nonetheless
very
nice
in
the
holiday
season
d
it
drank
good
but
not
great
its
still
a
very
good
tripel
beer
and
has
been
a
beer
that
has
gotten
me
into
craft
brews
thanks
monks
this
beer
actually
has
pretty
high
drinkability
once
it
has
warmed
a
little
and
once
its
actually
in
the
mouth
the
chimay
tripel
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
belgian
overall
this
beer
is
ok
probably
a
little
overhyped
and
i
still
belive
the
grand
reserve
is
by
far
their
best
effort
chimay
does
deliver
a
quality
tripel
with
their
white
label
d
very
drinkable
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
trippels
yum
o
great
drinkable
delicious
trappist
d
this
is
a
good
beer
though
i
feel
it
had
been
overhyped
to
me
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
another
easily
it
covers
up
that
8
pretty
well
i
feel
price
is
a
little
high
compared
to
tripels
i
felt
were
on
same
level
but
price
ignored
its
a
good
beer
taste
is
very
well
balanced
its
hoppy
but
not
bitter
at
all
its
a
bit
more
earthy
which
is
nice
theres
a
very
nice
belgian
yeastiness
as
too
be
expected
along
with
a
really
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
makes
it
very
tasty
and
drinkable
super
solid
d
good
beer
the
high
abv
is
decently
well
hidden
as
to
not
detract
from
the
beer
drinkability
this
is
absolutely
one
of
the
best
triples
ive
ever
had
the
fact
that
it
just
barely
cracks
the
top
10
of
the
style
is
surprising
not
only
is
this
a
musttry
tripel
but
also
a
perfect
introduction
to
the
world
of
belgian
beers
a
fine
standby
of
the
style
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
malt
banana
light
fruits
and
a
bit
of
spice
there
is
some
alcohol
there
as
well
medium
bodied
with
somewhat
low
levels
of
carbonation
drinks
fairly
well
but
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
chimay
trio
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
triples
unlike
westmalle
or
tripel
karmeliet
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
all
distinct
robust
and
most
importantly
smooth
unlike
these
beers
the
8
abv
of
the
chimay
just
adds
to
the
body
instead
of
taking
away
from
it
as
it
enhances
the
flavors
and
helps
make
the
beer
larger
than
life
the
balance
between
malt
and
hops
is
exceptional
and
really
allows
the
grain
to
shine
through
overall
probably
the
best
chimay
in
my
opinion
and
well
worth
whatever
you
might
pay
for
it
d
a
very
very
good
tripel
but
a
notch
below
world
class
probably
my
least
favorite
the
common
chimay
offerings
theres
nothing
particular
that
i
can
really
place
my
finger
on
but
this
is
just
a
minor
let
down
given
the
lofty
expectations
one
has
for
trappist
brews
one
of
the
beers
that
peeked
my
curiosity
for
better
beer
several
years
ago
al
together
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
could
drink
it
all
the
time
drinkability
probably
my
favorite
tripel
thus
far
i
was
actually
pretty
surprised
when
i
looked
at
the
abv
wouldnt
have
pegged
this
for
an
8
abv
beer
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
d
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
by
any
means
probably
wont
be
drinking
it
again
d
very
drinkable
solid
tripel
with
excellent
character
and
mouthfeel
dry
finish
leaves
you
wanting
more
overall
a
solid
tripel
while
nothing
about
it
makes
me
go
hot
damn
it
is
still
very
good
and
probably
a
required
drink
if
you
are
into
belgians
certainly
worth
a
go
cheers
very
smooth
finish
yet
very
crisp
i
get
some
peppery
aftertaste
that
lingers
very
well
i
like
chimays
brother
theodore
yeast
better
in
dubbels
and
quads
di
cant
find
anything
bad
to
say
about
this
ale
it
does
down
easyhas
the
right
tasteand
keeps
you
interested
please
send
me
some
free
samplesanybody
m
as
expected
it
has
a
wonderful
feel
to
it
that
only
a
belgian
can
give
thick
and
creamy
with
a
medium
weight
that
gives
way
to
an
extremely
crisp
finish
not
dry
crisp
a
little
graininess
from
the
yeast
if
you
disturbed
much
of
it
during
the
pour
the
taste
lasts
that
makes
you
to
drink
it
in
a
very
slow
way
if
you
want
to
enjoy
until
the
last
minute
of
flavour
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
2
fingers
of
cloudy
white
head
with
nice
retention
great
looking
pour
a
nice
yeasty
smell
some
banana
pear
spices
fresh
bread
even
some
floral
hops
fairly
sweet
tasting
belgian
candy
and
sweet
malts
shine
initially
but
balances
out
nice
with
the
fruit
hops
and
spiciness
lots
of
carbonation
and
somewhat
dry
but
smooth
a
very
well
balanced
example
of
the
style
as
ive
found
the
other
chimay
varieties
to
be
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
creamy
very
nice
overall
with
slightly
peppery
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
despite
this
foaminess
i
will
easily
finish
my
glass
the
spices
arent
overpowering
and
are
easily
consumed
this
isnt
my
go
to
triple
simply
because
there
are
local
belgian
style
versions
that
i
prefer
but
for
an
authentic
trappist
version
this
is
a
great
example
i
would
definitely
stick
this
beer
into
the
end
of
fall
category
as
it
almost
tastes
like
autumn
i
would
drink
it
sitting
around
a
bon
fire
maybe
cooking
some
fresh
caught
wellbuttered
white
bass
or
walleye
the
smell
of
burning
leaves
and
the
sound
of
crackling
wood
mingling
with
the
hazy
bitter
hops
and
yeast
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
bursting
just
as
i
finish
the
gulp
overall
i
enjoyed
it
im
not
done
looking
for
different
tripels
to
try
but
i
can
see
me
coming
back
ot
this
one
often
md
mouthfeel
is
good
the
medium
body
isnt
overly
smooth
but
still
feels
good
and
has
a
little
bit
of
a
harsh
edge
to
it
that
is
nice
drinkability
is
great
for
the
style
it
is
a
beer
that
has
a
great
flavour
and
feel
to
it
without
sacrificing
the
desire
to
consume
a
few
of
them
pours
a
apple
juice
color
with
a
white
head
and
really
nice
lacing
smells
of
apples
and
malty
goodness
tastes
spicy
peppery
bubblegum
flavored
with
apple
notes
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
and
smooth
drinkability
is
good
as
well
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
deep
tasting
and
rich
in
flavour
beer
it
offers
a
lot
to
the
mouth
as
it
goes
down
overall
i
would
not
lean
to
this
for
a
night
out
but
a
good
starter
or
finishing
beer
yeasty
phenolic
fruitiness
comes
through
on
the
nose
and
that
certainly
predominates
on
the
palate
as
well
apple
pear
as
well
as
the
usuals
there
is
also
a
slightly
pinelike
quality
that
yields
to
the
hops
giving
way
to
a
nice
dry
finish
the
alcohol
and
yeast
make
it
slightly
heavy
but
you
can
certainly
a
couple
in
a
session
very
unlike
other
triples
much
easier
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
much
more
balanced
although
it
also
has
much
lower
abv
than
others
this
is
a
damn
solid
tripel
its
heavy
use
of
hops
for
the
style
makes
it
stand
out
i
think
this
beer
is
better
and
more
complex
out
of
the
bottle
but
any
sort
of
chimay
ontap
is
nothing
to
scoff
at
drink
chimay
in
my
opinion
is
a
little
overhyped
the
beer
is
good
but
simple
the
tripel
is
no
different
a
little
bland
for
my
taste
pours
a
deep
yellow
orange
color
with
a
big
frothy
head
that
recedes
quickly
carbonation
streams
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
huge
vanilla
wafer
and
lemon
custard
aroma
has
a
spicy
after
note
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
astrigent
with
a
bitter
acidity
malted
flavors
with
vanilla
undertones
really
not
good
this
might
be
infected
or
just
not
be
my
favorite
triple
the
mouthfeel
is
over
carbonated
but
true
to
style
with
its
crispness
the
drinkability
is
just
above
average
for
me
because
its
just
not
tasty
at
all
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
hunting
down
d
chimay
is
always
delicious
and
this
is
a
perfect
example
why
not
like
your
typical
tripels
but
easy
to
drink
and
wonderful
flavor
none
the
less
i
would
like
to
rereview
this
beer
at
some
point
because
i
was
quite
disappointed
with
it
this
time
not
a
good
tripel
chimay
white
has
an
excellent
head
that
lasts
and
a
cloudy
amber
colour
it
has
a
yeasty
smell
to
it
this
beer
tastes
very
matly
to
me
and
reminds
me
of
leffe
blonde
its
malty
from
start
to
finish
this
beer
feels
great
in
the
mouth
and
is
well
carbonated
chimay
always
make
a
high
quality
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
mfd
a
faint
fizzle
of
carbonation
leads
a
medium
bodied
brew
though
one
is
more
than
enough
to
drink
at
any
one
time
d
a
very
good
belgian
drink
easy
to
down
and
considerably
light
for
my
expectations
for
my
first
tripel
style
beer
theres
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
it
is
a
solid
however
i
find
the
blue
and
red
label
chimays
to
be
much
more
enjoyable
i
really
have
no
complaints
but
found
the
overall
character
of
the
brew
to
be
lacking
something
i
couldnt
place
my
finger
on
caramel
sweetness
with
bright
citrus
fruity
hop
offsets
give
this
ale
a
celebratory
quality
that
one
would
think
appropriate
for
a
wedding
white
dress
white
cap
and
all
liked
this
alot
better
this
time
than
when
i
had
it
ontap
good
stuff
overall
another
point
for
belgian
beers
not
the
best
one
but
definitely
better
than
most
beers
das
mentioned
not
as
sharp
as
other
tripels
or
as
dry
for
that
matter
makes
the
beer
go
down
a
tad
easier
this
tripel
is
quite
delicious
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
stiffly
nice
inch
head
that
descends
slowlyish
leaving
little
lacing
atop
the
somewhat
cloudy
orangebrown
beer
the
aroma
begins
with
a
touch
of
banana
atop
apple
juice
but
then
the
head
descends
releaseing
a
strong
level
of
belgian
aromas
smells
delectable
and
bang
on
to
style
duh
the
taste
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
had
expected
finishes
fairly
dry
without
much
malt
i
was
hoping
for
a
beer
that
was
just
a
tiny
bit
thicker
overall
though
a
great
beer
to
drink
and
one
i
am
glad
i
found
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
favorite
large
flute
i
didnt
have
a
chalice
awesome
cloudy
golden
liquid
with
long
lasting
inch
and
a
half
fluffy
white
head
beautiful
spicy
peppery
belgian
aromas
hit
hard
out
the
top
of
the
glass
smells
delicious
taste
is
equally
impressive
fruity
and
spicy
with
a
great
balance
between
hops
and
malt
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
luxurious
drinkability
was
a
bit
harsh
due
to
the
8
but
whos
complaining
certainly
not
me
impressive
beer
and
a
delight
not
too
sweet
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
the
finish
is
dry
and
quenching
with
some
hops
coming
in
to
help
out
fresh
and
lively
is
the
feeling
i
get
at
the
end
of
a
sip
perfect
for
food
and
many
cheeses
the
corked
bottles
especially
make
a
nice
treat
with
dinner
but
try
either
bottle
with
pastas
wild
game
chicken
even
pizza
and
pub
fare
also
you
could
easily
set
one
away
in
the
cellar
for
several
years
most
likely
smoothing
out
some
of
the
raw
edges
and
uniting
to
become
ultimately
soothing
dthe
flavor
is
quite
good
the
nose
fell
a
little
short
as
it
was
dominated
by
yeast
and
malt
sweetness
a
complexity
not
seen
in
many
tripels
and
the
balance
that
makes
a
beer
great
this
is
a
darn
good
beer
corked
bottle
soft
amber
slightly
orange
hazy
with
huge
creamy
offwhite
head
strong
aroma
sweet
malt
overripened
fruit
and
floral
notes
very
pleasant
delicious
flavors
of
creamy
sweet
malt
raisins
with
slight
good
bitter
finish
alcohol
present
but
not
powerful
rather
smooth
well
balanced
malthops
i
really
love
the
smell
of
this
beer
plus
i
enjoyed
every
drop
maybe
im
not
with
the
majority
but
i
liked
this
better
than
the
chimay
blue
and
rouge
to
each
his
own
an
outstanding
quality
beer
grabbed
a
glass
at
trappist
looks
pretty
inspiring
in
a
chimay
glass
i
must
confess
great
fluffy
head
atop
a
deep
golden
body
nose
is
of
coriander
some
nutmeg
and
allspice
some
citrus
and
even
a
bit
of
hay
flavors
are
pretty
complementary
the
lemoncitrus
has
a
bit
of
a
bigger
punch
on
the
palate
though
extremely
pleasant
on
the
palate
with
ample
carbonation
and
dry
on
the
finish
so
drinkable
a
solid
example
of
style
always
easy
to
return
to
this
fella
d
a
fantastic
tripel
that
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
cant
believe
i
passed
this
over
for
years
flavor
is
great
trappistes
breweries
really
know
what
theyre
doing
thats
for
sure
a
small
amount
of
hop
bite
comes
through
in
this
beer
which
is
a
little
different
from
a
lot
of
the
other
belgian
tripels
ive
had
the
mixture
of
belgian
yeasts
crisp
sweet
fruits
and
slight
booze
really
make
this
enjoyable
and
stand
out
in
its
stylecatagory
jd
the
taste
was
a
bit
disappointing
though
the
alcohol
is
really
prevalent
yes
the
abv
is
high
but
compare
with
the
fullers
golden
pride
where
it
is
barely
noticable
in
the
taste
and
the
flavour
is
sort
of
acidic
drinkability
is
quite
low
on
this
one
ill
rather
stick
to
the
blue
and
red
ones
maybe
im
missing
something
here
this
beer
deserves
an
a
so
im
giving
it
one
i
have
to
say
after
multiple
multiple
tastings
this
beer
surprised
me
simply
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
ever
had
a
supremely
crafted
beer
d
very
drinkable
d
complex
spiciness
with
a
slight
malt
note
keep
em
coming
you
get
to
explore
this
beer
with
each
sip
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
but
im
not
impressed
there
are
better
tripels
out
there
drinkability
dangerously
so
the
old
belgian
light
body
high
alcohol
delicious
flavors
trick
i
fall
for
it
every
time
d
good
flavour
verging
on
a
wheat
beer
easy
to
drink
although
the
sourness
might
not
be
to
all
tastes
this
was
my
dessert
at
the
amsterdam
ale
house
in
ny
ny
dull
straw
color
styrofoamwhite
head
that
let
loose
with
spicy
grass
and
butter
i
know
this
thing
isnt
oaked
but
it
sure
smells
like
it
the
butter
is
prominent
in
the
taste
but
is
quickly
overtaken
by
bitter
fruitness
that
dries
out
and
leaves
a
nice
clean
sensation
behind
something
to
sip
slowly
after
a
turkey
ruben
or
anything
else
for
that
matter
while
waiting
for
the
evening
to
cool
off
enough
for
a
walk
back
to
the
hotel
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
offers
no
hint
in
the
taste
i
couldnt
feel
any
effect
until
long
after
id
drained
the
glass
bravo
drinkability
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
chimay
beers
i
have
had
so
far
i
like
the
spiciness
and
the
funk
but
alcohol
overtakes
this
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
blown
away
by
this
one
like
the
other
chimays
i
have
tried
d
i
think
i
might
be
turning
into
a
belgian
overall
a
really
tasty
tripel
but
probably
not
one
of
my
favorites
st
bernardus
or
westmalle
get
the
nod
it
pours
wonderfully
forming
a
gorgeous
white
whipped
cream
head
full
of
belgian
lace
i
love
the
herbalmedicinal
smeel
of
the
phenols
the
taste
is
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
with
just
a
little
bit
of
malt
sweetness
the
body
is
very
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
full
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
beers
and
my
favotier
scourmont
beer
i
had
this
great
brew
on
draft
in
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
creamy
orange
color
with
an
abundant
foamy
head
strong
spice
scents
and
mild
amounts
of
yeast
breadlike
scents
good
spicey
dry
flavor
mouthfeel
is
creamy
pretty
easy
to
finish
and
very
refreshing
not
balanced
and
a
bit
flat
could
it
have
been
old
drinkability
is
very
good
for
this
octane
level
very
enjoyable
beer
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
and
could
have
had
more
a
note
on
drinking
the
yeast
the
first
pour
left
most
of
the
yeast
behind
and
this
review
was
written
on
that
beer
i
deliberately
saved
the
last
bit
and
the
yeast
swirled
well
and
then
poured
it
into
the
glass
at
the
end
for
drinking
what
i
now
have
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
is
a
very
cloudy
half
inch
of
beer
well
permeated
with
yeast
not
surprisingly
this
has
changed
the
flavors
in
that
much
of
the
complexity
is
now
hidden
by
the
yeast
the
bitterness
is
now
forward
on
the
palate
the
fruit
aroma
and
flavors
are
concealed
and
the
beer
seems
simpler
o
a
bit
expensive
but
for
the
style
and
alcohol
perhaps
its
reasonable
well
break
out
a
bottle
of
chimay
every
once
in
a
while
over
cards
instead
of
wine
drinkability
quite
so
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
and
is
a
great
sipper
really
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
beer
enjoyed
this
at
mcouls
in
greensboro
nc
on
tap
its
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
modest
white
cover
and
minimal
signs
of
lace
the
aroma
brings
on
a
malt
and
bready
grass
hop
blend
pretty
typical
belgian
tripel
with
a
tasteful
clove
overtone
but
good
the
flavor
is
a
very
mellow
blend
of
syrupy
yeast
malt
and
citrus
hop
i
get
some
bayberry
and
oats
wheat
germ
and
vague
peach
more
complex
than
i
picked
up
with
my
nose
and
very
nice
overall
its
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
that
makes
for
a
pleasant
feel
and
a
very
drinkable
belgian
despite
the
abv
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
tons
of
sediment
particles
suspended
in
the
liquid
huge
head
even
with
a
careful
pour
aroma
is
fruity
and
full
of
yeast
along
with
some
spice
taste
is
fruity
with
a
slight
sourness
in
the
background
a
nice
amount
of
spiciness
finish
is
dry
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
its
not
bad
d
one
of
my
favourites
a
beer
perfect
for
special
occasions
or
just
the
rare
night
when
you
really
want
to
treat
yourself
i
can
polish
off
a
750ml
bottle
by
myself
without
any
regrets
just
a
damn
good
beer
not
much
more
value
i
can
add
here
poured
into
my
ale
goblet
with
a
rush
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
very
appealing
and
attractive
the
cloudy
golden
appearance
shows
plenty
of
yeasty
sediment
too
and
the
first
taste
is
a
rich
and
spicy
flavor
followed
by
a
slight
alcohol
presence
coriander
clove
and
candy
sugar
also
come
through
in
this
complex
and
perfectlydone
belgian
abbey
ale
the
hoppy
rolling
finish
is
just
icing
on
the
cake
absolutely
a
beautiful
and
delicious
beer
overall
its
great
this
is
a
defining
style
beer
that
every
one
tries
to
copy
but
most
cant
mouthfeel
is
creamy
the
head
never
dies
sweet
balanced
by
bitter
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
great
tripel
tastes
wellbalanced
malty
but
the
malts
are
lighter
bready
and
fruity
as
a
counter
this
has
a
nice
bite
from
the
mouth
that
continues
through
the
taste
the
alcohol
is
prominent
but
in
a
warming
nonoffensive
waylike
in
a
good
brandy
for
example
this
is
a
classic
and
i
find
the
chimay
white
to
be
underrated
compared
to
its
brothers
d
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
but
definitely
a
sipping
beer
to
enjoy
the
complexity
of
the
senses
serving
type
bottle
d
its
quite
different
compared
to
other
tripels
given
the
bitterness
but
its
still
a
wonderful
beer
to
sip
excellent
beer
and
one
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
again
d
at
8
this
was
a
slowgoing
sipper
im
not
sure
that
id
want
to
bite
off
much
more
very
sweet
and
too
bold
drinkability
with
a
taste
and
mouthfeel
like
the
the
one
this
beer
offers
i
could
have
easily
swallowed
the
entire
bottles
worth
however
the
amount
of
alcohol
per
bottle
is
the
one
preventative
all
in
all
a
truly
wonderful
brew
that
im
sure
will
be
another
purchase
of
mine
in
the
near
future
the
beer
poured
slightly
cloudly
with
a
golden
hue
to
it
lively
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
the
beer
has
a
fresh
hop
aroma
and
flavor
like
a
field
of
flower
and
spice
the
raisin
scent
distinct
to
the
yeast
is
also
present
and
when
i
close
my
eyes
i
can
get
a
taste
for
it
as
well
at
8
the
alcohol
is
beautifully
playful
present
but
so
subtle
you
can
underestimate
it
it
finishes
sharply
smooth
beautiful
beer
it
didnt
knock
me
away
but
it
certainly
is
a
brilliant
brew
well
worth
keeping
on
hand
highly
enjoyable
one
of
my
favorites
will
always
go
back
to
when
my
favorite
beer
store
has
nothing
new
to
offer
notes
vintage
2009
more
spicedherbedhot
version
of
a
tripel
with
less
fruitypeachy
sweetness
its
a
good
beer
and
enjoyable
to
drink
but
it
isnt
really
my
favorite
tripel
its
a
tasty
beer
and
i
would
have
it
again
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
ever
crave
it
or
really
feel
the
need
to
drink
another
definitely
worth
trying
though
just
didnt
wow
me
and
wasnt
my
favorite
interpretation
of
the
style
this
is
as
close
to
drinking
a
loaf
of
bread
as
you
can
get
such
a
great
yeasty
flavor
with
an
interesting
bitterness
and
theres
virtually
no
taste
of
alcohol
present
just
dont
drink
this
on
a
full
stomach
d
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
to
rate
this
very
high
but
the
beer
is
so
well
made
that
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
from
top
to
bottom
is
probably
the
most
consistent
tripel
ive
had
quite
drinkable
but
not
in
my
top
tier
of
tripels
taste
if
very
earthy
big
yeast
bite
and
a
bit
much
of
the
alcohol
is
present
feel
is
very
warm
and
does
finish
dry
great
drinkability
on
this
bottle
started
to
gush
foam
as
i
opened
but
i
was
ready
for
this
bastard
with
a
glass
in
hand
pours
a
golden
hazy
yellow
tastes
of
malty
dark
fruits
with
a
spicy
sweet
lingerness
in
the
finish
it
drinks
pretty
smooth
for
the
8
and
its
a
pretty
solid
tripel
overall
right
on
par
with
the
red
and
blue
from
chimay
a
world
classic
that
i
had
never
gotten
around
to
reviewing
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
orange
citrus
with
some
pepper
and
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
citrus
fruit
with
quite
a
few
spices
and
belgian
yeast
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
classic
example
of
the
style
that
never
disappoints
price
7
99
at
witherspoon
grill
the
taste
is
very
dry
and
bubbly
almost
like
a
champagne
kick
there
is
a
definite
bitter
bite
to
the
beer
but
it
is
very
refreshing
i
can
also
taste
a
hint
of
fruit
which
i
guess
comes
from
the
yeast
the
8
abv
is
hidden
well
in
this
beer
this
is
definitely
one
to
enjoy
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
red
and
blue
labels
fairly
sweet
tripel
with
lots
of
belgian
candi
sugar
flavors
and
alcohol
some
mineral
notes
are
in
here
and
lend
a
mild
chalky
component
there
is
just
enough
hops
i
am
guessing
saaz
to
make
their
presence
known
very
full
and
creamy
body
with
enough
prickly
carbonation
so
fluffy
in
the
mouth
it
is
like
drinking
a
cloud
this
is
a
damn
good
tripel
but
not
quite
up
there
with
the
best
of
em
although
the
more
i
drink
of
it
and
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
i
like
it
i
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
on
the
finish
and
a
little
better
hiding
of
the
abv
requisite
drinking
for
any
beer
geek
overall
a
quality
beer
that
i
appreciate
paired
well
with
the
right
foods
as
far
as
sipping
by
itself
i
usually
prefer
tripels
that
are
sweeter
than
this
one
d
a
drinkable
and
uppertier
tripel
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
on
revisiting
3year
old
bottle
62010
on
cork
three
years
later
than
original
review
52010
who
says
tripels
cant
improve
with
aging
ive
had
this
from
the
750
ml
bottle
ontap
and
the
11
2
oz
bottle
which
this
review
is
based
on
ive
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
bottle
conditioning
is
far
superior
and
does
wonders
in
the
small
11
2
oz
this
may
just
be
my
imagination
but
i
dont
think
so
too
bad
the
only
establishment
in
my
area
that
sells
this
size
is
in
the
next
town
over
ill
still
drive
to
get
it
drinkability
excellent
fruit
notes
good
body
enjoyable
d
excellent
drinkability
a
kick
ass
tripel
i
like
them
on
the
bitter
and
dry
side
and
this
one
more
than
delivers
i
was
sad
to
take
the
last
sip
overall
its
a
textbook
belgian
tripel
though
not
the
best
of
the
abbey
ales
it
helps
that
it
tends
to
be
the
most
available
and
least
pricey
of
the
bunch
too
its
a
good
beer
that
were
the
aromas
a
little
more
pronounced
would
be
an
alltime
great
m
d
impeccably
balanced
with
full
round
flavors
seductive
and
alluring
easily
drinkable
this
is
a
delicious
tripel
on
tap
so
dont
miss
the
opportunity
if
you
have
it
chimay
triple
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
the
aroma
is
strongly
bready
and
yeasty
upfront
that
gives
way
to
sweet
fruity
malt
and
some
nice
phenolic
character
the
flavor
is
both
dry
and
sweet
sharp
and
smooth
and
almost
tart
in
the
finish
tons
of
fruity
esters
and
powdery
yeast
come
through
followed
by
a
nice
dose
of
herbal
earthy
hops
and
a
healthy
bitterness
the
hop
character
is
quick
a
bit
stronger
than
i
expected
but
i
really
think
it
works
well
in
the
beer
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
i
often
look
past
this
beer
because
it
seems
quite
common
but
i
think
i
should
pick
it
up
more
big
hop
presence
for
a
triple
lots
of
sour
lemon
and
nutmeg
upfront
medium
bodied
with
a
surprisingly
crisp
mouth
feel
alcohol
is
very
apparent
but
does
not
dramatically
effect
drinkability
somewhat
spicy
and
grainy
toward
the
end
then
finishes
clean
like
a
dry
gin
martini
drinkability
ive
never
had
a
triple
before
so
i
cant
really
review
within
the
context
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
good
beer
its
a
bit
strong
for
what
you
get
taste
wise
though
in
my
opinion
it
is
sweet
fairly
bitter
and
alcoholic
all
at
the
same
time
i
like
the
red
a
lot
better
its
been
a
while
since
i
did
a
vertical
tasting
of
chimay
i
broke
down
got
a
really
good
deal
at
whole
foods
white
red
and
blue
label
with
a
chimay
glass
for
16
how
can
you
go
wrong
i
poured
the
bottle
into
the
chimay
glass
it
looks
classic
1
white
head
filled
the
glass
perfectly
the
beer
is
cloudy
straw
colored
the
nose
had
that
beautiful
belgian
yeastiness
with
banana
clover
citrus
coriander
the
taste
is
everything
the
nose
promises
with
a
good
carbonation
balance
very
crisp
and
light
the
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
this
beer
is
all
about
balance
not
overly
sweet
or
sour
on
an
unseasonably
warm
spring
day
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
this
was
one
of
the
first
truly
world
class
beers
i
ever
had
well
before
my
21st
birthday
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
last
had
one
and
i
am
surprised
this
may
be
more
pleasing
to
my
palette
now
than
it
was
when
i
was
a
novice
to
the
beer
world
d
a
true
gem
of
a
triple
ale
so
well
rounded
and
delicious
to
drink
i
tried
to
sip
it
and
then
i
just
wanted
more
and
more
it
is
a
must
try
overall
id
recommend
giving
this
a
shot
if
youve
never
tried
it
before
its
not
something
id
seek
out
but
wouldnt
object
to
trying
again
in
the
future
pours
a
lovely
copper
tinged
gold
with
a
white
head
that
is
more
rolling
hills
than
rocky
peaks
head
retention
is
decent
but
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
even
in
my
spotlessly
clean
goblet
aroma
is
spicy
and
tangy
with
plenty
of
character
less
clove
than
other
triples
i
get
a
lot
of
pepper
and
coriander
off
of
this
and
some
fruity
sourness
as
well
flavor
is
wonderfully
complex
and
well
balanced
plenty
of
coriander
and
white
pepper
with
some
grainy
yet
pleasant
astringency
also
picking
up
some
floral
hops
a
wonderful
fruitiness
and
just
a
touch
of
alcoholic
warmth
the
warmer
this
gets
the
more
sweet
and
fruity
it
becomes
with
apple
and
pear
notes
yum
this
beer
is
quite
dry
with
a
medium
body
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
spiky
but
it
works
with
the
dryness
to
leave
a
wonderful
quenching
finish
behind
after
every
tasty
sip
i
find
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
for
a
triple
this
was
the
first
beer
i
had
at
the
back
bar
at
monks
and
drinking
it
is
like
taking
a
trip
down
memory
lane
i
promise
though
no
bonus
points
for
nostalgia
well
maybe
just
a
few
overall
impression
a
unique
yet
classic
belgian
tripel
not
my
favorite
but
it
is
still
a
very
special
ale
add
it
to
your
must
try
list
a
fine
tripel
that
reminds
me
of
the
westmalle
but
isnt
quite
as
balanced
due
to
the
slight
hike
in
hops
still
an
extremely
enjoyable
brew
well
worth
its
price
tag
drinkability
this
is
a
sipper
at
8
but
it
is
going
down
rather
smooth
the
red
or
blue
dutterly
satisfying
i
want
to
drink
it
on
a
more
regular
basis
but
feel
guilty
in
indulging
on
this
fine
beer
too
often
d
very
good
triple
but
ive
had
better
not
too
much
alcohol
but
the
bitterness
and
carbonation
wouldnt
allow
too
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
drinkability
is
of
course
very
high
amazingly
smooth
and
goes
down
easily
i
just
love
the
style
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
it
not
the
best
but
still
absolutely
terrific
d
this
is
a
filling
beer
the
carbonation
kind
of
makes
you
feel
bloated
it
is
also
pretty
strong
as
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
it
makes
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
dangerous
in
a
good
way
of
course
a
beer
that
is
much
better
on
draught
to
me
it
just
doesnt
feel
the
same
out
of
the
bottle
which
could
be
a
freshness
issue
while
this
isnt
my
favourite
tripel
it
is
the
tripel
that
i
judge
all
others
against
due
to
having
ready
access
to
this
in
ontario
this
is
pretty
drinkable
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
pretty
good
beer
but
ive
had
better
tripels
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
there
was
good
flavor
and
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
for
8
abv
though
i
though
it
was
a
bit
pricey
wow
of
the
three
offerings
from
chimay
this
is
the
one
i
have
had
the
least
exposure
to
before
writing
these
notes
never
has
it
been
this
fresh
this
is
a
great
beer
solid
all
around
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
a
definite
plus
but
the
lack
of
complexity
and
bitter
bubble
gum
flavour
is
really
making
this
a
oneglass
beer
for
me
right
now
i
will
try
to
find
a
fresher
bottle
to
rereview
in
the
future
and
will
definitely
seek
out
a
750
but
first
impressions
are
not
doing
too
much
for
me
right
now
pretty
good
mouthfeel
soft
and
smooth
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
opaque
cider
color
with
a
nice
thick
foamy
beige
head
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
earthy
malts
and
spices
taste
was
a
mix
of
sweet
malts
some
alcohol
and
a
mild
bitterness
good
thickness
decent
carbonation
as
a
beer
very
drinkable
however
its
a
bit
pricey
and
would
probably
only
buy
it
sparingly
d
the
draft
version
is
definitely
not
as
good
as
the
750ml
bottle
but
it
is
damn
good
poured
into
chimay
chalice
has
a
nice
hazy
orange
appearance
with
a
slight
creamy
white
head
lots
of
carbo
bubbles
dancing
around
the
glass
aroma
is
of
earthy
yeast
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
taste
is
initially
tart
zingy
with
a
bready
grainy
interlude
light
hop
bitterness
follows
to
close
up
the
crispy
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
lively
from
the
high
carbonation
finish
is
just
so
crisp
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
amber
moss
rich
and
fruity
also
fruity
flavors
including
orange
curacao
and
some
spices
taste
a
little
acid
but
generally
fruity
firm
body
and
postbitter
taste
and
dry
spurred
by
a
touch
of
pleasant
liquor
this
beer
is
reminiscent
of
orval
but
less
complex
and
refreshing
however
it
has
a
convincing
bitterness
a
hopping
well
proportioned
and
well
balanced
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
grain
and
bubbly
dry
spring
aroma
yeasty
fruits
like
peaches
semisweet
melons
and
ripe
strawberries
te
tste
mirrors
the
aroma
a
lot
but
gives
more
depth
in
the
palate
of
the
beer
itself
the
yeasty
fruits
add
some
sweetness
with
the
sweet
yet
powdery
grains
you
get
sweet
yeasty
and
grainy
flavors
coming
together
nicely
hepalate
starts
powdery
and
finishes
bubbley
this
is
a
classic
example
of
a
tripel
even
the
alcohol
content
is
high
the
beer
feels
light
and
airey
on
the
tongue
almost
like
a
wheat
beer
overall
a
world
standard
for
this
style
this
beer
should
be
in
your
regular
rotation
drinkability
this
beer
does
not
showcase
the
alcohol
leading
to
a
beer
that
is
more
drinkable
than
its
abv
would
suggest
the
high
carbonation
is
unfortunately
a
tiny
bit
too
much
for
me
and
i
wish
the
aroma
was
a
bit
stronger
but
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
d
this
is
a
beer
that
begs
to
be
had
with
food
to
me
i
wasnt
super
impressed
until
i
started
eating
a
nice
cut
of
beef
with
it
something
about
that
really
brought
the
flavors
alive
a
fine
brew
with
plenty
of
flavour
and
lots
going
for
it
the
crisp
dry
finish
adds
to
this
beers
drinkability
this
is
very
drinkable
and
isnt
nearly
as
heavy
as
i
expected
the
only
problem
is
you
cant
drink
several
because
the
abv
unfortunately
i
like
this
beer
as
well
and
will
try
it
again
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
in
bottle
maybe
another
style
drinkability
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
brings
it
down
a
bit
but
the
flavor
is
fantastic
and
it
is
definitely
something
i
could
have
again
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
although
it
is
not
my
favorite
nor
my
favorite
chimay
beer
i
think
its
better
on
tap
as
well
something
im
always
pleased
to
have
in
my
glass
drinkability
refreshing
but
more
so
satisfying
as
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
your
lips
smack
light
on
the
stomach
and
frankly
dangerous
given
the
nearly
undetectable
alcohol
content
the
only
downside
i
can
find
is
the
reason
this
beer
sat
in
my
fridge
for
so
long
was
you
really
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
something
high
class
when
you
drink
this
slainte
d
great
flavor
a
bit
sweet
and
heavy
for
multiple
rounds
but
its
not
out
of
the
question
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
a
frothy
1
finger
head
which
disappated
slowly
a
flowery
aroma
the
taste
is
crisp
with
an
almost
chalklike
flavor
the
bitterness
is
apparent
in
the
aftertaste
from
the
taste
you
would
not
guess
that
their
is
8
alcohol
you
get
none
of
the
alcohol
burn
from
some
of
the
big
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
slighlty
overcarbonated
each
sip
seems
to
turn
to
foam
as
it
hits
the
palate
while
this
bottle
may
be
overcarbonated
the
flavors
will
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
overall
very
good
and
satisfying
chimay
nevertheless
i
missed
a
stronger
malt
presence
as
i
would
expect
from
a
tripel
ale
mouthfeel
is
dry
smooth
and
creamy
light
and
full
at
the
same
time
very
nice
drinkability
with
the
flavor
begging
you
to
drink
more
and
the
mouthfeel
only
adding
to
the
desire
superb
beer
from
top
to
bottom
drinkability
is
good
i
like
this
better
then
the
chimay
red
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
too
much
its
a
tasty
beer
and
well
made
but
the
flavor
profile
is
not
something
i
like
on
a
regular
basis
it
is
a
good
beer
though
and
i
would
recommend
it
some
beers
that
carry
the
trappist
hexagon
make
you
wonder
if
just
any
group
of
silly
men
in
robes
can
start
making
beer
this
is
not
one
of
them
one
of
the
six
oldest
trappist
monasteries
still
producing
today
the
abbaye
nore
dame
de
scourmont
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
hexagon
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
is
associated
with
greatness
a
fantastically
unfettered
tripel
best
enjoyed
from
a
750ml
and
company
enjoy
overall
a
good
tripel
with
a
strong
hop
presence
nicely
balanced
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
light
and
drinkable
overall
the
flavors
never
hit
the
high
notes
as
well
as
they
should
d
drinks
very
easily
provided
youre
into
belgian
beers
im
not
certain
id
down
a
750ml
bottle
at
ease
but
one
or
two
small
bottles
are
definitely
not
a
problem
to
drink
for
such
a
complex
and
fullflavoured
beer
i
would
like
to
have
chimay
white
selectively
as
i
would
a
prized
white
wine
or
the
like
i
would
recommend
this
as
an
excellent
aperitif
or
as
a
great
accompaniment
to
fish
overall
a
world
classic
example
of
a
fantastic
style
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
lets
say
campared
to
a
westmalle
but
delectable
and
dangerous
what
else
would
you
expect
from
a
bunch
of
lucky
monks
ive
tried
this
ale
many
a
years
but
this
is
my
first
formal
review
tastes
just
a
good
as
it
did
10
years
ago
d4
5
just
think
all
the
money
you
spend
on
it
goes
to
a
good
cause
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
that
my
brother
d
im
not
nuts
over
belgians
but
this
beer
is
enjoyable
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
ive
got
a
corked
and
caged
bottle
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
this
does
with
some
age
on
it
tripels
arent
my
favorite
style
but
changing
it
up
with
one
every
once
in
awhile
is
nice
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
im
drinking
a
330ml
right
now
but
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
the
big
corked
bottle
of
this
one
this
would
be
such
a
great
summer
beer
lots
of
flavour
and
smooth
as
hell
i
love
chimay
but
the
chimay
blue
is
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
three
even
so
all
three
are
incredible
and
blow
away
most
other
beers
you
could
try
this
is
lighter
than
the
other
two
and
is
very
refreshing
but
as
with
all
the
chimays
you
need
to
watch
out
because
they
all
are
very
drinkable
but
have
a
high
abv
that
could
get
you
in
trouble
if
you
have
not
tried
these
incredible
beers
do
drinkability
was
very
good
mouthfeel
very
smooth
carbonation
is
just
right
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
abv
readily
available
here
in
aus
which
is
a
bloody
good
thing
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
if
they
werent
so
high
in
alcohol
and
uncheap
d
drinkability
is
100
not
the
best
tasting
triple
ive
had
but
just
as
easy
to
drink
as
any
well
balanced
nothing
assaults
the
tongue
this
is
an
almost
perfect
beer
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
tripels
but
this
is
both
my
favorite
in
the
style
so
far
and
my
favorite
of
the
three
chimay
beers
i
will
certainly
get
this
again
drinkability
is
great
theres
nothing
here
to
beat
your
taste
buds
into
oblivion
just
a
great
drinkable
brew
this
is
a
great
tripel
that
i
enjoy
every
chance
i
see
it
on
tap
very
drinkable
despite
its
high
abv
d
i
think
ill
stick
to
chimays
other
styles
over
this
one
there
are
just
too
many
other
tripels
that
are
superior
to
this
entry
tm
full
bodied
midlow
carbonation
silky
nice
bitterness
a
little
spiciness
to
match
the
smell
subtle
alcohol
warming
mmm
mmm
mmm
chimay
white
hasnt
really
changed
my
view
of
tripels
i
can
appreciate
them
but
dont
love
them
having
said
that
this
is
a
good
one
the
belgian
yeast
presence
alone
is
enough
to
carry
it
very
far
the
spicy
side
is
a
tad
overdone
drinkability
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
overall
flavor
take
a
hit
nonetheless
its
a
classic
tripel
that
warrants
your
attention
d
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
becomes
more
obvious
once
it
warms
up
at
the
same
token
it
loses
a
lot
of
the
good
things
about
it
once
it
gets
warm
probably
the
weakest
of
the
chimay
line
of
beers
and
compared
to
other
tripels
like
la
fin
du
monde
or
to
st
bernardus
it
would
be
easily
be
3rd
would
i
get
again
yes
but
one
at
a
time
is
enough
d
very
nice
and
drinkable
although
alcohol
would
prevent
multiples
in
a
sitting
definately
will
drink
again
drinkabilty
is
fine
enough
and
i
had
no
problem
finishing
a
bomber
by
myself
in
one
sitting
to
be
honest
it
was
made
more
enjoyable
with
a
couple
nice
cheeses
i
had
with
it
a
cranberryinfused
goat
cheese
was
the
star
pairing
with
it
as
were
pieces
of
fig
cake
and
mixed
nuts
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
your
hands
on
some
items
like
these
to
have
with
it
it
only
heightens
the
enjoyment
drinkability
the
chimay
lineup
keeps
getting
better
for
me
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
will
certainly
be
having
again
drinability
this
beer
has
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
all
the
flavors
and
aromas
do
a
fine
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
d
this
is
a
good
beer
the
abv
makes
it
such
that
its
only
responsible
to
have
2
but
i
have
to
imagine
this
is
as
good
as
tripels
come
chimay
tripel
white
was
served
in
the
proper
chimay
branded
glass
it
appeared
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
there
seems
to
be
quite
a
bit
of
clove
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
also
has
quite
a
bit
of
clove
which
backs
off
a
bit
as
it
warms
with
more
fruit
like
flavors
becoming
apparent
i
dont
remember
the
bottled
version
seeming
to
have
this
much
clove
flavor
ill
have
to
try
one
again
to
see
if
it
does
value
lets
face
it
there
are
better
beers
out
there
for
the
money
effervescent
mostly
clear
honeyish
goldenorange
fluid
topped
with
rich
white
head
that
retreats
until
a
firm
thick
lacy
coating
is
left
the
scent
is
a
composite
of
peppery
phenolics
aromas
of
peach
apricot
refined
sugar
and
quite
evident
spicy
alcohol
somewhat
yeasty
with
peppery
phenolics
and
flavors
of
peach
apricott
incorporated
into
the
malty
body
balanced
by
some
hops
and
subdued
spicy
alcohol
high
carbonation
is
leading
into
dry
finish
with
prominent
bitter
aftertaste
that
seemingly
lasts
forever
although
the
beer
seems
hoppier
in
character
than
most
trappist
ales
hoppiness
is
quite
shy
until
the
aftertaste
phase
when
reveals
itself
as
an
everlasting
bitterness
this
beer
is
a
shirk
which
escapes
my
attempts
to
evaluate
it
aromas
and
flavors
are
somehow
hard
to
take
hold
of
the
apparent
absence
of
citrusy
esters
so
typical
of
a
triple
and
the
pronounced
dryness
remind
me
more
of
a
golden
strong
ale
than
a
triple
sharpedgedprickly
on
the
palate
and
rather
dry
chimay
white
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
brothers
d
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
nothing
is
dumbedwatered
down
im
not
gonna
drink
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
its
hard
to
knock
a
beer
in
this
style
for
being
full
flavored
late
in
the
beer
i
paired
it
with
a
slice
of
gouda
which
went
quite
nicely
this
is
a
very
solid
tripel
overall
my
favorite
chimay
beer
delicious
and
now
1
of
my
favorite
tripels
d
this
is
a
brew
that
should
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
but
can
also
be
enoyed
three
or
four
glasses
deep
it
just
depends
on
the
serving
type
a
local
bar
served
this
one
up
on
tap
and
its
so
much
better
in
that
form
i
could
have
three
or
four
in
that
form
without
blinking
an
eye
i
suggest
drinking
this
with
a
light
meal
maybe
fish
or
a
salad
any
food
that
is
strong
will
overpower
this
beer
too
quickly
a
very
flavorful
complex
and
drinkable
beer
an
all
around
great
belgian
beer
very
drinkable
you
can
throw
back
a
few
of
these
without
any
problem
excellent
brew
drinkability
is
superb
although
i
prefer
it
from
the
bottle
its
still
one
of
the
best
tripels
around
regardless
of
serving
type
from
a
gift
pack
poured
into
chimay
chalice
that
was
provided
hazy
light
amber
color
with
golden
highlights
and
a
creamy
thich
head
that
hangs
around
and
laced
the
entire
inside
of
the
glass
great
floral
and
fruit
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spice
i
enjoyed
the
taste
even
more
great
flowery
and
fruity
taste
with
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
and
i
think
this
hides
the
flavor
of
alcohol
very
well
a
joy
to
drink
i
usually
lean
towards
a
dubble
over
a
triple
but
in
this
case
i
liked
this
one
better
beer
is
oddly
bitter
in
the
front
and
back
of
the
mouth
bready
and
medium
bodied
there
is
a
slight
aftertaste
nice
sweet
fruit
flavors
in
the
midpalate
beer
seems
a
little
dry
time
for
the
second
sip
i
get
the
bitterness
again
its
not
a
bad
taste
in
fact
i
like
the
taste
of
the
beer
it
negatively
impacts
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
though
its
like
an
interuption
when
im
drinking
overall
a
good
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
smooth
tasty
and
dangerous
this
has
never
been
my
favorite
of
the
chimay
brews
and
some
of
the
floral
notes
can
be
overpowering
at
times
yet
after
what
must
be
30
tries
i
think
i
finally
get
what
theyre
going
for
and
all
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
this
one
seems
to
have
a
blonde
ale
quality
to
it
as
well
as
a
bit
of
sweetness
it
reminded
me
of
a
sweeter
leffe
poured
to
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
head
that
coats
the
glass
the
sediment
kind
of
sticks
to
the
sides
it
is
slightly
bitter
but
the
sweetness
is
more
powerful
no
alcoholic
taste
which
makes
this
one
a
keeper
d
a
pretty
good
tripel
from
a
very
respectable
brewery
not
my
favorite
chimay
offering
but
good
nonetheless
i
have
not
had
the
chimay
white
in
many
years
so
i
ordered
one
on
tap
at
a
local
mexican
restaurant
cloudy
orange
as
i
remembered
with
a
spicy
smell
the
flavor
was
strong
bubblegum
hops
really
robust
with
a
bit
of
spice
towards
the
finish
nice
soft
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
the
strength
of
the
flavor
was
easily
the
best
part
about
this
tripel
nice
but
i
still
think
the
dubbel
is
their
best
beer
d
all
around
a
great
beer
and
the
best
tripel
i
have
tried
so
far
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
alcohol
isnt
well
hidden
compared
to
others
tastes
and
smells
great
though
another
great
chimay
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
produces
a
big
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
the
appearance
is
light
amberish
and
cloudy
the
aroma
is
of
cloves
and
malt
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
little
bitterness
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
omg
i
cant
believe
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
now
im
wasted
but
it
was
nice
nice
fine
champagne
like
carbonation
adds
the
the
experience
certainly
a
nice
tripple
i
poured
this
from
a
22oz
bottle
labeled
l08446
on
the
lot
number
it
poured
a
cloudy
darkgold
color
maybe
a
light
copper
it
poured
with
a
large
white
head
and
had
a
sour
smell
with
a
hop
background
the
taste
had
more
hops
than
i
expected
this
is
a
very
approachable
tripel
that
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
ipa
only
milder
light
body
with
good
carbonation
it
is
a
good
quality
tripel
that
i
will
be
keeping
stocked
d
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
triples
but
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
im
definitely
going
to
be
looking
for
more
from
this
style
hopefully
theyll
be
as
good
as
this
one
d
very
drinkable
warmer
with
light
meat
pairing
is
delicious
this
is
a
very
drinkable
tripel
again
another
belgian
tripel
tasted
and
another
score
in
my
book
one
of
the
very
best
nice
tripel
but
a
little
weak
in
the
alcohol
department
which
is
noticed
i
quite
prefer
the
tripel
to
be
at
9
or
above
otherwise
the
candy
is
too
strong
for
me
its
still
a
good
brew
though
d
high
ill
be
buying
this
again
i
really
enjoyed
the
ease
of
drinkability
and
the
strong
lilachoneysuckle
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
divine
give
me
more
another
great
brew
from
chimay
all
3
red
blue
and
white
are
a
must
try
the
tatse
and
smell
is
floral
hops
with
some
crisp
bitterness
and
slight
breadiness
almost
as
if
from
wheat
but
there
is
little
complexity
and
depth
fruity
notes
are
entirely
absent
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
well
not
stale
but
not
as
good
as
others
a
light
malty
aroma
rises
out
of
this
hazy
blonde
brew
topped
with
a
thin
lacy
white
head
light
malty
flavors
with
some
tartness
well
balanced
but
no
hop
presence
is
noticeable
the
body
is
light
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
finishes
with
a
tart
malty
sweetness
and
fades
relatively
quickly
good
stuff
but
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
the
taste
delivers
on
the
aromas
and
finishes
with
medium
citric
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
for
all
the
malt
it
doesnt
taste
or
feel
too
sweet
smooth
and
creamy
good
to
start
and
then
turns
crisp
since
its
actually
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
with
the
bitterness
i
sometimes
get
tired
of
chimay
being
the
representative
trappist
at
most
places
but
i
gotta
catch
myself
think
am
i
seriously
going
to
begrudge
a
place
for
serving
a
great
beer
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
by
the
monks
this
is
very
similar
to
other
triples
i
have
had
minus
the
weird
orange
peel
taste
on
the
finish
i
think
i
like
the
red
better
than
the
white
but
i
have
yet
to
try
the
blue
despite
a
slow
deliberate
pour
a
very
thick
foamy
head
develops
on
top
of
the
dense
orange
colored
ale
the
aroma
is
quite
inviting
with
notes
of
banana
yeast
and
spice
the
flavor
is
largely
a
continuation
of
the
aroma
with
a
dry
fruity
sweetness
and
spicy
overtones
this
flavor
is
somewhat
hidden
by
the
high
amount
of
effervescence
but
this
feature
also
hides
the
flavor
of
8
alcohol
overall
though
this
is
a
very
good
very
drinkable
tripel
originally
reviewed
on
october
3
2009
highly
recommend
it
ontap
still
would
recommend
it
in
a
bottle
not
as
enjoyable
as
its
brother
chimay
blue
but
still
very
good
overall
a
nice
complex
easy
drinking
beer
it
actually
made
me
appreciate
that
much
more
unibroues
version
of
the
tripel
la
fin
du
monde
2
down
and
1
to
go
for
the
chimays
available
to
me
leaves
me
looking
forward
to
the
red
cap
into
a
goblet
poured
a
hazy
yellowgold
with
two
fingers
of
bright
white
head
and
very
good
lacing
the
smell
was
a
bouquet
of
clove
coriander
banana
lemon
zest
orange
peel
hay
and
yeastiness
the
taste
was
a
tiny
bit
more
subdued
than
the
nose
with
the
fruit
hitting
hard
first
then
dissolving
to
yeast
and
herbs
and
then
finishing
on
a
spicybitter
note
very
good
but
ive
had
some
better
tripels
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
moderately
spritzy
it
couldve
benefitted
from
more
carbonation
but
in
retrospect
i
was
surprised
that
the
flavor
wasnt
more
intense
given
the
low
level
of
carbonation
definitely
light
enough
to
session
but
id
look
for
a
tripel
with
more
intense
flavor
d
a
fine
quaff
indeed
chimay
is
one
of
those
things
in
life
that
are
everything
they
are
made
out
to
be
i
prefer
the
white
and
the
blue
over
the
red
though
another
one
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
with
friends
overall
a
tasty
beer
but
im
still
gonna
stick
with
my
fin
du
monde
massive
taste
everything
about
the
aroma
carries
over
to
the
taste
the
alcohol
taste
becomes
stronger
as
the
beer
warmed
up
but
overall
it
was
nicely
balanced
overall
this
is
another
tasty
offering
from
chimay
and
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
recommend
conclusion
never
gotten
to
try
chimay
on
tap
this
was
a
treat
its
a
little
different
than
out
of
the
bottle
and
id
think
a
bit
fresher
than
i
can
usually
get
bottled
around
here
the
hops
come
through
much
stronger
and
its
not
quite
as
yeastyphenolic
as
the
bottled
version
classic
and
tasty
taste
was
pretty
mellow
and
had
a
light
malty
feel
different
tastes
included
burned
sugar
lemon
grapefruit
oranges
grapes
raisins
and
cherries
this
one
also
had
a
lot
of
hops
which
is
not
common
of
most
belgians
i
have
tasted
sweet
all
the
way
through
until
the
dry
finish
d
really
nice
brew
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
drinks
well
spicy
and
belgian
with
lots
of
character
d
this
one
goes
down
nice
and
easy
great
flavor
to
go
along
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
abv
is
a
little
too
high
for
this
to
be
a
session
beer
but
this
would
be
good
with
certain
meals
good
brew
ill
certainly
seek
out
the
others
d
one
per
sitting
will
buy
more
drinkability
i
would
have
another
if
i
had
another
d
wonderful
belgian
ale
a
shining
example
of
the
style
and
another
tripel
that
the
belgians
can
proudly
show
off
poured
into
a
chalice
appears
a
goldenhoney
color
cloudy
and
turbid
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
having
little
retention
aroma
was
huge
yeast
and
bready
malt
were
most
apparent
then
caramel
malt
and
fruit
notes
including
banana
very
sweet
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
each
swirl
of
the
glass
provided
another
aromatic
thrill
very
inviting
taste
was
very
sweet
and
bready
up
front
and
the
sweetness
lingered
into
the
finish
ultimately
giving
way
to
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
noticeable
warming
it
was
almost
like
drinking
hawaiian
bread
mouthfeel
was
light
but
smooth
and
became
even
smoother
as
it
warmed
high
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
overall
a
very
tasty
and
warming
triple
would
definitely
have
again
but
not
more
than
one
at
a
time
as
this
seems
to
pack
more
of
a
punch
than
even
the
8
abv
would
suggest
creamy
body
and
bold
alcohol
contrast
with
fruit
and
yeast
flavors
nicely
finishes
extraordinarily
well
smooth
and
buttery
but
has
a
touch
of
rough
graininess
to
it
overall
a
great
brew
though
nothing
short
of
what
i
expect
from
chimay
poured
a
wonderful
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
head
slightly
cloudy
from
a
330ml
bottle
balanced
with
a
wonderful
citrus
nose
with
bready
undertones
and
a
bit
of
belgian
funk
makes
for
a
truly
unique
and
wonderful
smell
taste
is
balanced
as
well
with
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
green
apple
almost
celeryfennel
undertone
absolutely
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
perfectly
carbonated
hiding
its
abv
very
well
also
this
is
highly
drinkable
minus
the
price
which
isnt
as
bad
a
the
blue
but
also
not
as
worth
it
as
the
blue
is
very
good
beer
with
a
bite
but
not
to
much
pale
orangeamber
in
color
decent
head
that
actually
lasts
smells
awesome
earthy
malty
dry
hints
of
orange
wet
clay
dry
mushrooms
and
more
crazy
complex
crazy
malty
tastes
sigh
tastes
like
its
all
astringency
bleh
tastes
astringently
bitter
mouth
puckering
it
seems
to
me
that
they
should
both
mash
out
and
have
shorter
sparges
but
hey
this
terrible
offtaste
is
typical
in
many
belgians
a
shame
really
d
i
could
go
back
for
another
i
might
go
back
for
another
if
i
had
one
so
i
could
try
and
figure
out
the
taste
a
little
better
i
like
this
about
the
same
as
chimay
red
but
not
near
as
much
as
i
love
the
blue
ill
have
to
try
a
few
more
tripels
and
revisit
this
one
and
try
and
decipher
its
flavors
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
alchohol
content
it
is
a
overall
good
beer
i
just
had
a
unibroue
la
fin
du
monde
a
couple
of
days
before
this
it
was
quite
similar
but
i
was
surprised
that
i
preferred
the
unibroue
offering
just
slightly
though
d
ill
revise
if
needed
but
this
is
my
favorite
chimay
better
than
red
or
blue
id
like
a
750
ml
of
this
d
stupendous
my
favorite
chimay
offering
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
its
got
some
substance
to
it
but
its
not
filling
its
incredibly
easy
to
drink
but
the
alcohol
is
deadly
be
careful
a
33cl
bottle
poured
into
my
chimay
goblet
the
tripel
appears
a
hazed
rich
copper
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
fluffy
lingering
bone
white
foam
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
spicy
peppery
yeast
tart
green
apples
under
ripe
banana
sweet
caramel
malt
mild
hints
of
citrus
medium
to
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
a
world
class
ale
certainly
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
nice
apricot
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
disipates
quickly
with
some
lacing
smells
of
straw
and
some
fruitiness
tastes
just
like
a
tripel
should
grassy
with
some
fruity
sweetness
a
bit
of
a
bitter
or
sour
finish
but
i
expect
that
is
normal
of
a
true
belgian
tripel
goes
down
exptremely
smoothly
if
you
can
handle
the
bitter
finish
great
beer
drinkability
highly
drinkable
but
parts
of
the
flavor
profile
hold
this
guy
back
a
little
bit
i
acknowledge
that
this
is
totally
subjective
and
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
beer
in
future
pours
a
dark
hazy
golden
color
with
a
beautiful
smooth
head
smell
is
of
apple
with
a
nice
spicy
note
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
apple
and
other
fruits
come
through
with
a
spice
backbone
a
little
cinnamon
flavor
comes
through
nicely
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
even
at
8
great
mouthfeel
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
high
carbonation
very
refreshing
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
i
could
probably
drink
many
of
these
in
one
session
drinkability
overall
aan
excellent
tripel
but
there
are
better
out
there
d
would
definately
drink
more
had
the
price
been
lower
a
beer
to
celebrate
life
with
as
expected
another
good
beer
from
chimay
good
drinkability
for
the
abv
im
really
starting
to
come
around
on
this
belgian
thing
this
is
a
nice
solid
one
and
i
would
have
this
again
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
along
with
fin
du
monde
st
bernardus
westmalle
and
stones
sawyers
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
big
white
head
smells
of
belgian
yeast
taste
is
sweet
fuller
body
than
most
tripels
peppery
spicyness
in
the
middle
and
a
hint
of
tartness
in
the
finish
there
is
also
a
touch
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
good
example
of
a
tripel
a
must
try
deceivingly
strong
i
am
not
good
at
sipping
beers
and
left
me
feeling
quite
happy
after
two
bottles
the
head
was
so
big
and
creamy
and
the
taste
was
yeasty
and
fresh
beautiful
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
head
that
lasted
all
the
way
down
and
stuck
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
belgian
yeast
esters
on
the
nose
those
tastes
dominate
on
the
taste
as
well
but
they
are
followed
by
nice
fruit
flavor
not
from
real
fruit
so
the
best
i
can
come
up
with
is
something
like
peaches
just
not
a
berry
or
dark
fruit
flavors
overall
a
very
complex
and
relatively
user
friendly
tripel
d
great
complicated
flavors
but
bitter
and
with
very
noticeable
alcohol
d
another
fantastic
tripel
id
love
to
try
it
again
if
only
so
i
could
get
a
proper
pour
but
i
have
no
doubt
i
would
enjoy
it
at
least
as
much
a
great
sipping
beer
d
what
an
amazing
brew
i
could
easily
enjoy
many
of
these
the
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
this
is
truly
a
great
tripel
i
dont
think
this
is
a
beer
that
id
want
to
consume
several
of
over
the
course
of
a
night
its
got
a
pretty
big
air
about
it
and
you
certainly
want
to
savour
it
cant
fault
it
for
being
involving
and
inviting
sip
after
sip
though
strong
scents
of
clove
some
berry
fruits
a
creamy
taste
a
good
amount
of
clove
and
spice
with
a
light
alcohol
finish
the
only
thing
id
say
is
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
too
high
otherwise
fantastic
ill
have
another
d
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
carbonation
is
pleasantly
mild
still
the
lackluster
taste
and
offputting
aftertaste
make
me
uncertain
whether
i
want
to
bother
finishing
this
brew
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
can
just
think
of
more
pleasant
ways
to
use
my
liver
and
daily
caloric
intake
very
solid
tripel
had
on
tap
in
a
chimay
chalice
at
a
burmese
restaurant
kind
of
surprised
to
see
it
there
had
a
goldencopper
hazy
appearance
has
a
good
balanced
taste
with
the
yeastyfruity
taste
i
expect
from
a
tripel
a
good
beer
especially
as
an
introduction
to
belgian
beers
i
suppose
everyone
should
try
it
at
least
once
if
only
to
get
an
idea
what
a
solid
tripel
tastes
like
theres
nothing
bad
about
the
beer
or
unbalanced
or
anything
i
guess
i
just
dont
find
it
as
interesting
and
complex
as
some
of
the
other
tripels
ive
encountered
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
lovely
chimay
chalice
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
peachcopper
color
with
a
frothy
dense
two
finger
head
nose
is
a
mixture
of
spicy
phenols
cloves
a
bit
peppery
and
some
fruitiness
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
but
more
potent
and
the
alcohol
is
readily
obvious
in
a
solventy
way
decent
flavor
on
the
front
end
but
ive
had
much
better
disguised
alcohol
on
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
with
a
velvety
thick
carbonation
and
dry
finish
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
ive
had
belgians
better
than
this
that
were
brewed
here
in
the
good
ol
usa
normally
not
a
fan
of
tripels
but
i
really
like
this
one
personally
chimay
white
is
not
my
favourite
tripel
and
the
chimay
monastery
doesnt
make
my
favourite
trappist
beers
that
said
i
like
the
white
as
i
do
all
of
this
brewerys
offerings
a
whole
heck
of
a
lot
like
the
blue
and
red
this
is
a
permanent
stay
in
my
cellar
and
a
welcome
addition
to
many
dinners
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
trappist
and
its
awfully
hard
to
find
a
bad
belgian
tripel
you
must
try
this
beer
hazy
orange
body
under
one
finger
creamy
head
slow
dissipation
nice
lacing
curacao
orange
in
the
nose
with
a
complex
spice
aroma
juniper
coriander
ginger
minimal
hop
aromatic
presence
sweetish
taste
not
as
sweet
as
westmalle
but
not
so
much
candi
sugar
more
citrusy
orange
lemony
and
esters
and
one
of
the
most
complex
spice
flavor
profiles
ive
ever
encountered
with
clove
and
coriander
predominant
very
dry
finish
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
not
an
everyday
beer
but
certain
one
every
ba
should
experience
at
least
once
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
line
of
bubbles
a
couple
swirls
and
the
head
immediately
returns
the
aromas
coming
off
of
this
beer
are
bready
yeast
spice
floral
hop
and
fruit
initial
taste
is
bready
malty
yeasty
with
some
spice
coriandercinnamon
and
a
sweet
fruitiness
then
there
is
a
bitterness
that
kicks
in
along
with
an
earthy
floral
hop
flavor
the
beer
finishes
rather
dry
with
a
warm
alcohol
and
lingering
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
tingle
from
the
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
during
and
dry
and
tingly
after
lots
going
on
very
nice
this
is
a
great
beer
i
like
the
hop
presence
but
maybe
not
the
elevated
bitterness
for
me
the
bitterness
takes
away
some
of
the
character
introduced
from
the
other
flavors
and
overpowers
them
of
course
the
bitterness
does
mask
the
high
alcohol
all
in
all
it
is
very
delicious
and
well
crafted
drinkability
a
bit
heavy
so
you
wouldnt
drink
these
quickly
i
mean
youd
be
mad
to
youd
be
wasted
and
full
an
incredible
beer
all
round
the
only
other
tripel
i
have
to
compare
it
to
is
la
fin
du
monde
which
is
more
intense
and
overwhelming
in
flavor
which
makes
it
an
epic
brew
but
for
some
would
be
too
much
this
is
more
of
a
balanced
grown
up
la
fin
du
monde
which
makes
it
more
of
relaxed
an
subtle
experience
i
wouldnt
say
i
prefer
either
over
the
other
but
theyre
slightly
different
chimay
is
more
subtle
and
solid
while
la
fin
du
monde
is
in
your
face
chimay
is
more
delicate
back
to
drinkability
though
rather
easy
to
drink
for
what
it
is
bmc
adjunct
or
american
beer
style
lovers
beware
this
beer
has
flavor
and
complexity
a
nice
trippel
not
as
good
as
the
westmalle
but
close
hides
the
alcohol
well
a
must
try
for
trippel
fans
d
i
cant
think
of
a
reason
why
you
shouldnt
buy
this
one
possibly
if
your
allergic
to
gluten
and
therefore
cant
enjoy
malty
products
yes
gluten
allergy
is
the
only
possible
excuse
for
not
buying
and
enjoying
this
fantastic
beer
d
easy
to
finish
and
will
be
checking
this
one
out
more
often
being
available
year
round
in
every
store
makes
this
one
seem
less
appealing
to
me
for
some
reason
the
benchmark
for
the
style
a
truly
world
class
beer
experience
drinkability
very
drinkable
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
will
be
drinking
it
again
for
sure
i
enjoy
this
for
a
tripel
something
about
this
reminds
me
of
unibroues
maudite
more
than
other
tripels
smoother
and
maltier
works
well
for
me
very
solid
atmosphere
pretty
good
appearance
great
full
nose
great
full
balanced
flavor
no
chinks
in
the
armor
here
strong
alcohol
taste
but
not
too
overpowering
this
is
a
really
great
quaff
to
sit
down
and
savor
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
well
this
one
wasnt
outstanding
to
me
its
not
that
it
wasnt
up
to
par
the
appearance
was
outstanding
however
it
just
wasnt
drinkable
and
the
flavors
aromas
just
kind
of
remind
me
of
a
wit
the
alcoholic
burn
on
this
was
a
big
turn
off
to
me
ive
had
other
chimay
ales
before
which
hide
the
alcohol
well
this
one
does
not
all
in
all
not
bad
i
dont
think
ill
be
forking
over
another
12
bucks
a
bottle
for
it
again
though
id
rather
stick
with
chimays
grande
reserve
not
a
big
fan
sorry
i
guess
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
tripel
style
although
this
is
probably
the
best
one
i
have
had
to
date
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
beer
just
a
decent
belgian
ale
i
feel
it
needed
a
little
more
character
and
complexity
to
warrent
a
better
score
still
recommended
and
worth
a
try
d
refreshing
and
abv
is
very
well
hidden
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
a
good
one
and
well
made
from
the
1
pint
9
4
fl
oz
bottle
marked
l08751
sampled
on
the
my
50th
birthdayjune
16
2009
this
was
my
birthday
treat
for
myself
the
pour
is
a
coppergolden
tone
with
a
couple
fingers
of
foamy
offwhite
head
it
is
cloudy
and
carbonated
the
aroma
is
a
pleasing
yeast
hop
and
breadlike
mixture
well
in
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
heavier
creamy
and
kind
of
chewy
i
am
enticed
by
the
slightly
hopped
and
yeasty
taste
that
has
a
faint
hint
of
something
tart
or
sour
but
just
enough
to
make
it
even
more
appealing
rather
than
overwhelming
a
fantastic
balance
too
much
carbonation
not
a
big
deal
just
let
it
sit
for
a
while
also
theres
some
slight
astringency
present
drinkability
i
really
like
this
style
and
this
is
a
great
offering
i
rate
it
high
but
i
feel
kind
of
guilty
about
it
because
im
sure
if
i
did
sit
through
a
couple
id
be
feeling
it
pretty
heavily
d
pour
another
one
rich
mouthfeel
very
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
high
carbonation
bitterness
lingers
lightly
good
stuff
so
even
after
warming
to
around
room
temp
the
flavors
seem
to
be
staying
roughly
the
same
its
a
damn
good
beer
and
worthy
of
being
revered
as
it
is
but
for
me
its
just
not
hitting
the
way
i
thought
it
would
maybe
i
got
my
hops
up
a
bit
too
high
drinkability
pretty
high
well
within
style
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
what
more
would
you
want
the
well
hidden
nature
of
chimay
makes
quality
brews
and
this
beer
doesnt
break
the
mold
buy
up
drink
up
it
was
good
but
not
my
favorite
tripel
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orange
color
the
head
is
large
billowy
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
lacing
all
over
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
leather
citrus
lemon
and
hay
the
taste
begins
with
lemon
and
citrus
notes
and
finishes
with
a
sharp
funky
barnyard
thing
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
really
good
tripel
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
in
many
aspects
this
is
a
straight
forward
beer
it
is
still
complex
in
flavor
when
compared
to
a
euro
pilsner
for
example
or
more
to
the
point
a
belgian
tripel
however
it
isnt
simple
lets
say
its
straight
up
the
business
and
a
damn
good
tripel
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
few
dark
colored
floaters
in
the
glass
smell
is
spicy
taste
is
complex
spicy
ketones
and
friuty
esters
as
expected
from
belgian
yeasts
overall
smooth
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
have
to
give
this
a
very
good
drinkability
because
of
the
carbonation
and
fantastic
flavor
this
could
come
close
to
being
my
favorite
tripel
along
with
la
fin
du
monde
dsuprisingly
drinkable
despte
the
high
abv
scary
combo
the
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
shines
there
is
no
noticable
alcohol
just
nice
smoothness
dangerous
drinkability
very
drinkable
an
excellent
beer
drinkability
very
good
i
found
myself
drinking
it
pretty
quickly
at
first
trying
to
put
words
to
what
i
was
tasting
however
i
never
thought
it
was
too
heavy
or
i
was
drinking
it
too
fast
for
an
8
this
is
very
good
i
could
drink
this
all
night
at
least
i
think
i
could
drinkability
ive
enjoyed
every
chimay
product
available
and
this
is
no
exception
highly
recommended
for
anyone
wanting
to
introduce
themselves
to
the
belgians
ive
never
been
in
love
with
tripels
but
imagining
the
things
that
attract
people
to
this
style
i
can
only
think
its
nothing
short
of
stellar
d
i
love
trappist
brews
they
can
do
no
wrong
in
my
eyes
this
is
a
great
ale
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
this
is
one
to
savor
and
enjoy
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
that
thins
down
to
a
creamy
half
inch
one
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
i
can
smell
a
lot
of
yeasty
esters
citrus
some
spice
for
a
8
percent
beer
it
drinks
very
very
easy
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
a
ton
of
mellow
flowery
esters
and
a
bit
of
citrus
i
was
told
by
a
chimay
rep
that
it
has
cascade
hops
in
it
so
i
cant
tell
if
the
citrus
is
from
the
american
hop
addition
or
the
yeast
pooping
something
tasty
out
this
is
probably
the
easiest
drinking
tripel
ive
had
and
at
8
percent
its
pretty
dangerous
kind
of
a
strange
mouthfeel
going
on
sparkly
fine
carbonation
with
medium
body
almost
seems
a
tad
watery
at
times
but
it
might
be
from
enjoying
almost
all
full
bodied
beers
lately
nice
dry
finish
hardly
any
alcohol
flavors
detectable
easy
to
drink
but
it
definately
creeps
on
you
definately
worth
a
try
but
the
blue
label
is
much
better
never
had
the
red
drinkability
1st
class
while
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
it
is
a
pretty
good
one
now
i
can
officially
say
chimay
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
trappist
breweries
d
easy
for
a
tripel
but
still
a
sipper
overall
a
beauty
of
a
triple
chimay
really
makes
some
great
stuff
and
this
is
probably
the
best
triple
ive
had
so
far
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
wholeheartedly
recommended
d
another
great
tripel
that
ive
had
the
chance
of
sampling
over
the
last
few
days
the
finish
is
a
little
rough
but
the
flavors
are
extremely
well
rounded
on
the
front
end
still
a
bit
too
medicinal
for
me
to
love
on
a
regular
basis
as
with
most
any
tripels
as
far
as
my
palate
goes
but
another
enjoyable
foray
into
a
oncehated
style
a
pretty
intense
strong
pale
ale
with
the
yeast
and
monastery
turn
rendering
this
the
standardbearing
tripel
it
is
an
easy
slow
sipper
as
the
alcohol
seems
to
gain
strength
over
time
with
a
concurrent
uptick
in
general
flavour
complexity
good
and
verily
holy
stuff
an
unexceptional
but
highly
drinkable
trappist
brewed
tripel
considering
the
8
abv
this
is
a
surprisingly
mild
beer
this
is
a
classic
beer
one
that
can
be
easily
overlooked
as
it
has
become
so
commonly
availble
but
it
should
not
be
d
not
my
favorite
from
chimay
however
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
as
it
warms
up
i
definitely
get
more
spicy
phenols
two
people
even
sensed
some
tuna
fish
in
there
somewhere
my
bottle
says
best
before
2011
is
that
the
year
of
the
fish
md
soft
on
the
mouth
even
with
the
alcohol
esters
burning
at
the
tongue
i
love

a

a
fine
example

overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
am
glad
i
got
to
drink
this
beer
and
i
really
recommend
it
even
at
8
abv
i
think
i
could
easily
drink
another
d
a
fine
brew
that
went
down
pretty
easy
pales
in
comparison
to
a
westy
12
but
good
in
its
own
right
great
beer
but
i
like
the
red
a
little
better
now
if
i
could
only
find
them
both
on
tap
at
the
same
place
so
i
can
really
compare
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
beautiful
clear
golden
that
is
quite
appetizing
aroma
is
subtle
and
gentle
fairly
fruity
and
just
a
little
malty
flavor
is
mainly
fruity
apple
and
banana
just
a
little
bit
sweet
with
a
good
malty
undertone
texture
is
silky
smooth
so
it
goes
down
nicely
i
have
had
this
from
a
bottle
and
ontap
is
definitely
better
mouthfeel
slightly
sweet
a
bit
of
dryness
petite
kleine

carbonation
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
finish
smell
is
of
malt
sweetness
and
alcohol
taste
is
similar
with
some
yeast
and
banana
flavors
very
good
very
drinkable
a
bit
of
extra
carbonation
but
overall
very
drinkable
i
like
it
better
than
the
red
i
enjoyed
chimay
tripel
but
when
i
want
to
reach
for
an
outstanding
tripel
in
the
future
i
think
itll
be
la
fin
du
monde
da
very
nice
beer
overall
but
a
bit
of
a
bummer
when
compared
to
the
red
and
blue
label
chimay
this
one
is
solid
but
leaves
me
a
bit
flat
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
my
first
from
chimay
and
its
getting
me
excited
to
try
the
red
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
one
does
with
some
more
cellar
time
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
in
a
few
years
edit
now
that
the
glass
has
warmed
somewhat
im
getting
some
very
pleasant
chewy
malt
flavours
coming
through
d
interesting
complex
tasty
cheers
to
my
first
belgian
tripel
a
very
nice
tripel
although
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
department
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
medium
bodied
but
creamy
with
a
great
crisp
carbonation
drinkability
my
favorite
beer
at
roxys
along
with
rogue
dead
guy
ale
i
could
have
a
few
more
with
out
getting
too
tipsy
but
thats
all
and
am
willing
too
also
i
have
to
admit
i
expected
more
from
this
one
based
on
how
much
i
love
the
white
yeasty
earthy
smell
has
a
great
unique
spicyclove
taste
similiar
to
the
smell
yet
different
date
on
the
cork
was
1008
i
wonder
how
the
taste
changes
with
more
age
its
a
great
drinkible
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
dry
with
a
yeast
note
left
in
the
mouth
i
am
getting
more
of
a
citrus
taste
as
it
warms
up
a
little
i
will
definately
try
some
more
of
these
drinkability
if
it
werent
for
the
price
tag
this
is
one
id
have
a
lot
more
often
pours
a
hazy
orange
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
somewhat
quickly
smell
is
nicely
strong
very
yeasty
some
banana
smells
and
some
sweet
notes
taste
follows
the
smell
with
a
strong
flavor
the
alcohol
is
apparent
the
mouthfeel
is
not
very
smooth
but
this
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
this
one
is
a
nice
drinker
great
flavor
not
overpowering
an
inviting
beer
that
delivers
worth
checking
out
dangerously
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
offering
chimay
always
hits
the
spot
when
in
sesrch
of
a
belgian
ale
easily
recommended
overall
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
and
its
readily
available
if
you
are
traveling
and
just
want
a
reliable
beer
to
enjoy
dare
i
say
this
is
more
enjoyable
to
me
than
the
grande
reserve
ultimately
i
find
something
very
pleasing
about
this
beer
perhaps
its
that
my
expectations
werent
as
great
as
the
blue
but
i
really
see
this
as
a
more
enjoyable
beer
d
quite
drinkable
despite
the
abv
its
been
too
long
since
i
had
this
one
and
i
wont
let
that
happen
again
a
classic
for
sure
d
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
the
thing
i
like
about
chimay
beers
is
the
overall
high
level
of
drinkability
and
this
one
is
no
different
not
too
rich
too
sweet
or
too
much
except
maybe
in
dryness
pours
a
beautiful
bright
gold
that
is
just
a
little
hazy
a
thick
frothy
1
5
inch
mostly
white
head
tops
the
beer
thick
heavy
lacing
covers
the
glass
like
north
georgia
kudzu
smells
like
buttered
toast
with
fruit
and
alcohol
notes
first
sip
is
mind
blowing
smooth
that
screams
world
class
creamy
malty
sweet
then
bitter
with
the
yeast
character
youd
expect
from
chimay
the
8
abv
is
there
but
this
is
sessionable
d
because
its
definitely
not
overly
sweet
this
beer
went
really
well
with
bold
food
i
was
very
impressed
with
how
easily
this
8
brew
went
down
im
a
huge
fan
much
cleaner
than
alot
of
belgian
triples
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
strong
pale
imo
complexity
rules
this
beer
which
seems
to
be
a
trademark
of
chimay
great
beer
from
some
great
brewers
dthis
is
a
creamy
ale
thats
easy
to
go
down
nothing
upsetting
i
can
drink
this
often
pours
a
very
nice
light
golden
color
with
plenty
of
yeasties
in
it
smell
is
belgian
yeast
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
spicy
with
some
more
belgian
yeast
and
a
bit
of
funk
going
on
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
chimay
of
the
three
full
mouthfeel
and
creamy
nice
highly
sessionable
and
very
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
quite
often
d
just
a
tad
bit
less
drinkable
than
the
red
could
be
due
to
more
hops
or
less
fruitiness
although
it
is
still
very
good
d
high
lots
of
flavor
with
little
to
no
alcohol
taste
the
flavor
however
is
slightly
bitter
for
a
tripel
drinkability
is
high
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
with
a
great
taste

of
the
fine
brews

2
oz
brown
bottle
i
picked
up
for
4
99
at
a
local
store
pours
cloudy
rich
golden
amber
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
of
banana
lemon
spice
and
raisins
taste
is
very
similar
with
more
banana
and
lemon
with
a
little
grainy
malt
and
sweet
fruit
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
dry
slightly
tart
finish
i
am
not
in
the
hadit
of
paying
5
bucks
for
a
single
but
this
one
is
worth
every
penny
a
classic
d
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
8
abv
the
crisp
balance
and
clean
feel
making
drinking
a
75cl
bottle
a
pleasure
and
not
a
chore
even
at
the
end
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
the
beer
but
that
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
the
beer
is
a
dark
gold
blonde
with
a
large
head
of
mainly
bigger
bubbles
that
reduces
quickly
to
a
film
on
the
surface
that
does
not
disappear
biscuity
notes
with
cinnamon
are
the
first
thing
i
notice
with
more
fruits
showing
up
in
the
nose
as
the
beer
warms
fruits
upfront
in
the
mouth
sweet
and
tart
with
a
small
residual
bitterness
taking
over
at
the
end
the
beer
camouflages
its
8
abv
rather
nicely
you
could
drink
three
or
four
of
these
before
it
sneaked
up
on
you
in
a
bad
way
pours
a
cider
amber
body
with
onefinger
head
that
dies
real
slow
and
left
a
sheath
lace
around
the
glass
hints
of
pear
dark
fruit
and
sweet
malts
like
caramle
and
gum
are
mixed
into
the
aroma
a
very
smooth
body
greets
the
tongue
close
to
fullbodied
with
crisp
hoppy
carbonation
and
a
malt
sweetness
mixed
in
perfectly
with
fruits
and
finishes
with
something
akin
to
a
dry
herbal
tea
finality
the
abv
is
tucked
away
bc
theres
a
slight
alkie
crisp
sensation
but
nothing
that
overpowers
i
could
sip
this
as
long
as
it
is
in
front
of
me
drinkability
i
have
to
say
i
was
very
disappointed
by
this
beer
it
looked
good
but
just
went
downhill
from
there
to
me
it
didnt
smell
like
a
tripel
tasted
watery
and
was
difficult
to
drink
it
wasnt
necessarily
bad
tasting
but
i
was
definitely
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
youd
never
know
that
this
was
8
flavors
are
perfectly
balanced
this
is
a
very
highly
drinkable
tripel
love
this
stuff
those
monks
know
what
they
are
doing
havent
had
this
one
in
about
a
decade
while
my
expanding
waistline
wont
agree
with
me
you
gotta
love
what
this
forum
does
to
get
you
to
tryretry
new
beer
while
at
almost
6
00
for
this
little
bottle
i
will
definitely
be
having
this
one
much
more
often
drink
this
a
fabulously
unique
and
complex
beer
from
abbaye
de
scourmont
my
favorite
of
the
chimays
overall
the
prevalent
alcohol
may
be
a
bit
too
much
to
have
2
of
the
750
ml
bottles
one
size
is
a
nice
touch
and
i
feel
pretty
satisfied
after
finishing
the
bottle
no
doubt
cinq
cents
is
a
damn
good
tripel
this
bottle
is
fairly
fresh
sept
08
so
im
sure
that
an
older
bottle
would
be
a
bit
more
mellow
that
said
this
is
still
a
fantastic
beer
i
just
wish
that
trappist
beer
didnt
come
at
such
a
premium
as
ive
found
that
i
generally
enjoy
the
nontrappist
options
just
a
little
bit
more
it
helps
that
theyre
a
little
easier
on
the
wallet
just
saying
crisp
and
refreshing
with
medium
carbonation
this
one
has
a
mildly
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
alcohol
never
really
sets
in
until
the
very
end
so
the
8
feels
like
a
lot
less
this
is
a
solid
offering
and
the
most
affordable
chimay
so
i
could
see
myself
sampling
this
again
overall
there
nice
spiciness
to
the
beer
but
it
is
kinda
refined
and
soften
by
the
malt
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
it
is
not
pungent
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
carbonated
and
astringent
the
finish
is
bitter
and
dry
giving
the
beer
a
crisp
edge
the
beer
comes
across
as
complex
but
refined
i
enjoyed
this
beer
although
i
felt
that
the
beer
was
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
future
outlook
i
will
certainly
pay
to
consume
this
beer
again
poured
into
a
chimay
glass
with
a
foggy
amber
color
and
a
strong
smell
of
yeast
and
malt
with
a
slighly
fruity
smell
very
full
feeling
in
your
mouth
thick
and
heavy
but
smooth
tasty
beer
easy
to
drink
lasting
head
and
leaves
a
residue
in

glass
my
favorite
tripel
to
date
very
complex
flavor
i
noted
orange
some
raisin
and
maybe
even
oaknot
sure
a
little
too
high
in
price
for
me
to
buy
regularly5
00
for
11
ounce
it
must
be
good
to
be
a
monk
if
this
is
what
they
get
to
have
daily
next
im
going
to
try
westmalles

this
is
not
a
session
ale
but
one
to
savor
however
it
is
such
a
mild
tasty
treat
that
one
could
easily
overdo
it
drinking
a
duvel
tripel
is
like
waltzing
through
a
wheat
field
in
the
setting
sun
on
a
warm
august
day
another
great
beer
from
chimay
the
name
escapes
me
but
id
tried
one
in
a
blue
bottle
awhile
ago
though
my
friends
from
the
plains
kansas
and
missouri
gave
me
grief
for
ordering
an
upscale
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavour
to
it
dont
make
it
a
session
beer
ok
theres
lager
for
that
purpose
taste
is
smooth
slightly
rich
and
very
pleasant
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
carries
through
not
over
gassed
as
was
the
grande
reserveblue
and
with
much
better
balance
easily
the
best
chimay
has
to
offer
i
hope
to
compare
this
and
st
bernardus
tripel
in
a
head
to
head
for
the
championship
soon
both
exquisite
drinkability
another
great
belgian
classic
and
all
in
all
a
wonderful
beer
the
aromas
are
perhaps
not
overly
interesting
but
the
taste
is
so
wellbalanced
and
complex
as
for
the
alcohol
you
definitely
notice
it
but
it
fits
into
the
overall
character
definitely
worth
a
try
and
a
second
round
drinkability
as
always
with
chimay
a
great
trappist
however
i
would
find
it
a
bit
more
pleasing
if
it
were
merely
somewhat
increased
in
viscosity
drinkability
here
was
ok
i
dunno
if
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
especially
considering
its
high
abv
a
very
drinkable
choice
but
and
alcohol
content
would
limit
my
session
great
beer
to
have
in
the
collection
drinkability
i
think
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
bit
more
out
of
the
bottle
though
i
could
be
mistaken
as
its
been
a
long
time
and
my
scores
arent
terribly
different
that
said
its
still
a
great
beer
a
classic
tripel
with
well
hidden
alcohol
and
even
if
the
flavors
arent
the
best
the
perfect
balance
between
components
a
very
good
tripel
indeed
every
time
i
took
a
sip
it
was
as
though
it
were
the
first
intriguing
from
start
to
finish
and
absolutely
sublime
a
very
interesting
beer
and
a
classic
in
its
own
right
required
drinking
for
any
tripel
fan
overall
decent
tripel
but
after
recently
trying
westmalle
this
doesnt
seem
as
good
as
i
remember
the
alcohol
becomes
noticeable
sooner
despite
it
being
only
8
compared
to
wests
9
5
i
expected
it
to
be
sweeter
although
i
enjoyed
the
spiciness
and
yeastiness
of
it
nice
floral
aroma
taste
is
moderately
bitter
some
fruit
tastes
but
dry
not
sweet
not
too
much
aftertaste
maybe
a
hint
of
some
sweet
malt
creamy
fullbodied
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
throughout
good
brew
and
one
of
my
top
six
rated
active
bottled
beers
for
style
very
drinkable
and
fiendishly
so
as
the
elevated
alcohol
sneaks
up
because
of
the
fact
overall
rather
delightful
and
certainly
praiseworthy
though
the
12
99
price
tag
the
pub
attached
was
outrageous
good
thing
i
wasnt
buying
d
very
drinkable
as
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
mfd
very
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
pervasiveness
of
the
alcohol
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
but
im
going
to
have
to
say
that
i
liked
the
dubbel
red
better
from
chimay
thats
unusual
for
me
but
they
totally
nailed
the
dubbel
and
it
feels
to
me
that
the
tripel
is
just
a
little
above
average
for
a
belgian
tripel
the
first
time
i
tried
a
belgian
beer
i
hated
it
and
refused
to
try
another
now
i
realise
that
a
lot
of
things
can
happen
to
a
belgian
beer
from
the
time
it
is
brewed
to
the
time
it
is
drank
especially
when
it
is
sent
to
mississippi
this
beer
has
shown
me
that
they
are
not
all
bad
but
it
may
take
some
time
to
get
used
to
the
style
d
not
too
intimidating
of
the
three
chimays
this
is
probably
the
most
sessionable
amazingly
drinkable
a
classic
and
one
to
have
again
and
again
there
are
many
belgian
tripels
to
explore
but
you
can
always
come
home
to
this
one
d
a
good
tripel
a
couple
during
a
session
would
certainly
invoke
a
warm
glow
d
much
better
than
i
expected
not
being
a
big
trippel
fan
very
crisp
and
dry
which
adds
to
drinkability
d
really
drinkable
but
not
so
exciting
i
was
kinda
expecting
more
overall
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
good
tripel
definitely
worthy
of
another
buy
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
of
a
touch
of
fruits
and
spice
it
tastes
very
tart
and
bitter
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
it
has
a
nice
lacing
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
believe
there
are
better
triples
out
there
being
a
chimay
i
believe
that
everyone
should
try
it
atleast
once
i
dont
think
im
a
tripel
fan
this
one
pours
a
nice
pale
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
in
my
chimay
glass
aroma
is
fruity
with
some
hops
mostly
apple
aroma
to
me
flavor
is
very
dry
with
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
the
finish
is
just
a
little
rough
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
its
hard
to
tell
what
is
fizz
and
what
is
beer
almost
feels
like
drinking
carbonated
water
i
would
like
to
have
had
more
up
front
flavor
on
this
one
and
it
could
have
benefited
from
being
a
touch
sweeter
and
that
is
the
only
time
ive
ever
asked
for
that
in
a
beer
wouldnt
have
more
then
one
of
these
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
medium
hazy
golden
with
a
fairly
large
sized
white
frothy
head
nice
lacing
with
good
retention
when
i
first
poured
it
i
noticed
the
ever
so
slight
hint
of
skunk
in
the
aroma
but
it
went
away
quickly
after
that
there
was
a
nice
spicy
banana
and
malt
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
nice
and
has
a
noticeable
peppery
taste
which
is
a
good
thing
also
fermented
fruits
and
malts
as
with
most
belgian
beers
it
is
a
very
elegant
beer
when
poured
in
the
matching
glassware
too
different
for
me
to
want
to
get
it
again
d
very
high
i
would
and
hope
to
have
this
again
drinkability
tastes
good
and
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
relatively
high
abv
though
not
a
drinking
beer
i
usually
drink
chimay
after
dinner
and
only
one
the
few
brews
that
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
would
order
again
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
after
being
let
down
by
the
chimay
blue
but
this
beer
has
reaffirmed
my
faith
in
this
brewery
and
will
have
to
give
the
blue
a
second
shot
love
tripels
and
love
this
beer
this
is
really
drinkable
as
it
has
no
offensive
tastes
and
doesnt
feel
particularly
heavy
in
the
stomach
d
very
easily
drinkable
compared
to
its
trappist
brothers
the
bitterness
gets
weaker
for
every
sip
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
this
beer
with
all
the
trappist
hype
i
was
expecting
something
better
however
i
think
this
is
a
very
deep
beer
and
maybe
i
need
to
work
on
my
pallet
a
bit
more
i
felt
the
bottle
got
better
at
the
end
when
i
mixed
the
yeast
in
d
notes
this
is
well
balanced
and
pretty
drinkable
for
a
heavier
beer
this
is
clearly
a
top
shelf
tripel
and
because
of
this
i
have
kind
of
decided
that
i
really
dont
like
tripels
as
a
style
im
not
saying
that
to
knock
chimay
or
this
beer
tripels
just
arent
my
thing

picked
up
a
gift
pack
to
try
these
beers
and
to
get
a
goblet
the
white
tripel
was
probably
my
favorite
of
the
three
a
little
less
sweet
than
some
of
my
favorite
tripels
but
still
quite
good
drinkability
not
sure
if
id
reach
for
another
great
tasting
could
only
drink
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
though
great
beer
kind
of
the
unknown
brother
to
the
other
chimay
beers
but
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
trappist
not
as
good
as
westmalle
tripel
but
fantastic
nonetheless
as
trippels
go
not
one
of
my
favorites
murky
gold
pour
with
a
bubbly
white
head
aroma
is
yeasty
and
spicy
with
a
tiny
bit
of
banana
the
taste
is
heavily
vanilla
and
raisins
mixed
with
what
i
can
only
describe
as
cake
batter
no
banana
or
yeast
esters
at
all
very
creamy
mouthfeel
probably
will
not
get
again
just
too
much
vanilla
drinkability
im
glad
ive
finally
tried
the
chimay
line
after
much
passing
by
this
beer
although
not
as
flamboyant
as
the
grande
reserve
is
a
good
example
of
the
tripel
style
and
is
tasty
yet
reserved
i
will
definetley
seek
this
out
in
the
future
for
sure
drinkability
very
tasty
very
enjoyable
the
dryness
and
subtlebutdeep
complexity
mean
this
wouldnt
be
well
suited
to
several
in
one
evening
but
a
single
bottle
is
very
enjoyable
reviewed
on
33008
bottle
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
initial
aroma
was
of
skunk
which
got
fainter
as
the
beer
warmed
but
was
still
present
taste
of
light
fruits
but
no
distinguishable
tastes
spices
bitter
finish
this
was
good
but
lacked
the
complexity
of
the

or
even
the

the
bitterness
is
a
bit
strange
for
my
personal
tastes
but
its
got
a
very
rough
character
that
i
like
good
drinkability
but
not
my
favorite
balanced
with
incredible
resinence
overall
i
was
never
a
huge
belgian
guy
but
with
quality
beers
like
this
one
i
am
learning
to
enjoy
them
great
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
blue
and
red
the
taste
is
yeast
and
sweetness
with
small
jab
of
black
pepper
the
finish
is
a
little
bitterness
and
spices
it
has
nice
amount
of
carbonation
to
match
and
is
crisp
and
nice
to
drink
this
would
be
a
great
beer
with
dinner
drinkability
very
good
drink
definitely
not
something
to
pound
back
or
have
more
than
two
or
three
ofg
but
should
be
savored
another
worldclass
beer
from
chimay
drinkability
far
better
than
even
i
had
remembered
an
enjoyable
tripel
quite
drinkable
interesting
and
readily
available
this
ale
like
everything
chimay
has
is
very
drinkable
the
high
abv
makes
me
stay
away
from
having
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
but
its
tempting
othis
is
a
very
well
crafted
good
beer
but
the
flavors
just
dont
pop
to
give
it
great
ratings
that
said
i
could
drink
this
for
a
while
and
never
notice
how
drunk
i
actually
became
m
medium
to
mediumheavy
body
great
mouthcoating
alcohol
and
carbonation
sting
just
a
little
too
much
for
it
to
be
perfect
but
it
is
darn
close
d
very
nice
drinkability
spicy
tangy
and
refreshing
i
noticed
some
definitely
yeasty
undertones
and
i
have
to
admit
that
the
8
abv
comes
through
pretty
loud
on
this
beer
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
especially
if
you
are
used
to
lower
abv
beers
and
softer
forms
of
drink
md
a
bit
fizzy
couldve
use
a
few
more
years
on
the
shelf
in
my
closet
still
spectacularly
chimay
pours
an
amber
colored
body
with
a
small
white
head
some
spices
and
some
alcohol
are
present
in
the
aroma
has
a
pale
and
dry
taste
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
but
not
enough
to
balance
the
bitterness
in
my
opinion
with
the
alcohol
so
well
hidden
this
is
an
excellently
drinkable
brew
nice
and
easy
its
chimay
man
some
o
the
best
stuff
in
the
world
nuff
said
overall
great
beer
complex
and
rich
in
flavors
nicely
balanced
as
well
drinkability
excellent
trippel
one
of
the
best
ive
had
solid
beer
pours
a
slightly
fogged
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
all
dough
and
spices
and
a
lot
of
it
flavor
is
the
same
load
of
spices
loads
of
dough
funk
hits
on
the
back
side
smooth
liquid
feel
standard
carbonation
this
my
friends
is
a
tripel
notes
i
love
trappist
beers
and
this
is
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
monks
rock
d
very
good
tripel
but
honestly
not
blown
away
by
this
brew
as
i
expected
real
good
brew
but
i
enjoyed
victorys
golden
monkey
more
and
expect
theres
better
out
there
in
the
us
micro
community
definetly
a
brew
you
should
try
as
its
a
staple
in
the
beer
world
but
be
prepared
for
a
good
to
solid
experience
only
d
very
complex
and
definitely
unique
i
like
this
one
a
lot
although
the
alcohol
definitely
made
its
presence
known
overall
an
excellent
belgian
tripel
one
that
meets
commonly
accepted
style
guidelines
but
more
importantly
its
enjoyable
to
drink
has
a
lot
of
interesting
flavor
and
isnt
overpowering
in
any
way
recommend
for
sure
d
out
of
the
3
chimays
i
enjoyed
this
the
least
i
love
their
own
characteristics
tho
red
is
very
dry
white
has
a
big
bitter
hoppy
kick
blue
is
just
well
just
beautifully
balanced
brilliant
d
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
classic
tripel
while
it
isnt
all
that
pretty
to
look
at
it
sure
is
a
pleasure
to
sip
i
would
think
some
age
would
do
this
one
well
too
a
solid
inch
of
foam
that
slowly
subsides
along
the
edges
a
slope
of
carbonation
climbs
some
particles
in
the
beer
looks
like
peach
nectar

d
for
a
tripel
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
does
not
overpower
you
or
your
taste
buds
with
too
much
of
an
alcohol
burn
definitely
a
nice
beer
that
you
might
be
able
to
have
a
few
of
because
it
tastes
and
feels
so
good
before
you
realize
it
was
bad
idea
reccommended
this
is
a
style
i
enjoy
a
great
deal
but
not
one
i
get
to
experience
on
tap
too
often
this
offering
feels
a
bit
lighter
on
the
drinkability
scale
and
is
quite
enjoyable
good
stuff
d
this
is
a
great
tripel
i
enjoy
all
chimay
brews
and
this
one
hits
the
mark
too
starts
out
with
a
tart
fruity
taste
im
thinking
white
grapes
then
puts
forth
a
little
bitterness
and
some
grainy
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
with
a
sharp
tingle
from
the
carbonation
good
stuff
picked
up
this
bottle
a
while
back
and
thought
i
had
already
consumed
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
bright
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
nice
and
yeasty
with
some
apricot
fruit
notes
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
mildly
fruity
with
a
heavy
does
of
spicey
funk
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
fizzy
but
nice
and
smooth
fairly
drinkable
but
the
blue
red
were
much
better
pours
a
hazy
orangegold
color
that
leaves
a
little
sediment
in
the
glass
the
head
is
unavoidably
massive
the
nose
is
spicy
yeasty
earthy
and
you
can
detect
that
some
tartness
will
be
present
the
flavor
is
mainly
spicy
and
yeasty
tangy
fruity
and
earthy
notes
are
present
too
along
with
some
alcohol
d
very
drinkable
in
all
weather
and
certainly
food
friendly
pours
a
orange
color
slightly
hazy
topped
with
a
thick
offwhite
foamy
head
slightly
creamy
head
aroma
is
fruity
banana
with
some
yeast
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
citrusy
with
a
mix
of
fruits
banana
grapefruit
and
orange
somewhat
of
a
tart
winey
sour
presence
overall
this
is
excellent
with
a
complex
mix
of
flavors
while
being
even
quite
refreshing
pours
similar
to
the
chimay
red
except
the
color
is
much
lighter
the
color
is
a
deep
golden
orange
the
head
is
also
huge
all
of
the
chimays
looks
so
good
in
the
glass
that
was
included
with
them
the
smell
a
stronger
odor
than
the
red
the
flavor
is
very
dry
with
hints
of
grapes
the
bubbles
from
the
head
heavily
cover
the
glass
this
was
a
very
tastey
ale
but
it
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
chimays
d
a
very
easy
drinker
although
as
is
typical
with
the
belgians
watch
out
for
your
sobriety
i
tried
it
with
a
couple
friends
and
one
had
the
perfect
description
he
said
this
tastes
like
leather
and
yes
in
that
weird
way
it
did
nothing
sat
right
with
me
it
wasnt
too
strong
or
bitter
or
hoppy
or
malty
or
anything
like
that
it
just
made
my
mouth
say
why
did
you
just
drink
that
it
did
get
a
little
easier
to
drink
and
i
went
on
but
i
still
did
not
care
for
it
sorry
to
bring
this
beer
down
but
everyone
else
should
know
what
they
are
getting
into
this
is
obviously
not
a
session
beer
but
it
is
super
tasty
overall
this
is
a
solid
tripel
a
bit
sweeter
than
others
that
ive
had
but
its
done
well
drinkability
very
good
booze
is
there
at
8
5
but
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
takes
a
while
to
realize
so
for
8
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
shes
a
definite
keeper
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
bit
it
is
a
beer
to
sip
and
savor
like
a
good
night
of
intimacy
you
want
it
to
last
but
you
dont
want
to
rush
wow
what
a
delicious
beer
pours
a
honey
golden
yellow
with
slight
haze
fluffy
white
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
spotty
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
subtle
sweetness
and
a
slight
hop
aroma
taste
is
outstanding
slighty
fruity
with
a
sweet
malty
undertone
perfectly
blended
tongue
light
and
fluffy
mouthfeel
that
rolls
magically
through
the
tastebuds
easy
to
drink
but
slow
down
and
savor
the
flavor
d
definitely
a
sipping
beer
drinkability
i
dont
know
its
drinkable
i
guess
but
you
have
to
like
this
type
of
beer
and
i
definately
need
to
try
more
beers
of
this
kind
to
judge
d
pretty
tasty
beer
but
not
sessionable
at
all
one
750ml
is
more
than
enough
not
the
best
triple
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
a
solid
beer
just
not
my
favorite
this
taste
was
blind
and
last
for
me
ive
had
it
a
few
times
before
in
unblinded
fashion
and
never
liked
it
i
love
the
red
and
blue
and
love
other
trappist
tripels
so
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
idiosyncratic
i
like
it
drinkability
not
sure
why
it
took
me
over
1000
reviews
to
finally
try
this
beer
very
good
beer
that
im
sure
i
will
be
having
again
in
the
future
this
is
the
lighter
spicy
side
of
chimay
the
beer
is
full
bodied
but
there
is
a
lighter
saison
like
flavour
to
this
beer
the
finish
is
crisp
and
peppery
with
a
little
yeast
on
top
i
like
the
way
this
works
with
many
foods
best
drunk
fresh
rather
than
cellared
full
bodied
mouthfeel
but
with
active
carbonation
that
keeps
it
from
being
particularly
bready
apple
and
pear
reside
in
the
taste
as
well
as
the
nose
eventually
leading
into
into
some
spice
very
dry
finish
invites
some
follow
up
sips
but
i
couldnt
have
too
many
could
drink
one
or
two
of
these
very
good
taste
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
me
i
had
this
beer
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
its
always
nicwe
when
they
have
the
glassware
to
match
the
beers
this
beer
poured
beautifully
a
beautiful
amber
nicely
carbonated
with
a
white
head
the
smell
was
of
a
nice
begian
ale
the
taste
was
very
intense
and
well
balanced
sometimes
imo
belgians
go
overboard
with
the
flavor
but
this
was
wonderful
beautiful
malts
btw
this
coming
from
a
hophead
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
if
not
for
the
pricetage
this
would
definately
be
something
i
could
drink
all
night
poured
this
into
a
chimay
chalice
pours
a
hazy
rustic
amber
yellow
with
a
foamy
head
that
recedes
quickly
smell
is
where
this
is
at
as
this
beer
warms
up
the
smell
is
amazing
sweet
raison
bread
grass
rubbing
alcohol
i
enjoy
submerging
my
face
in
the
glass
to
catch
these
nice
smells
taste
is
heavy
carbonated
with
a
nice
tart
apple
flavor
to
start
then
a
warming
bread
aftertaste
with
just
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
and
a
dry
finish
overall
this
is
pretty
impressive
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
tripel
which
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
overall
this
was
pretty
tasty
with
my
pasta
dinner
and
washed
the
flavors
right
down
and
the
carbonation
refreshed
my
palate
garrett
oliver
is
an
amazing
foodbeer
pairer
overall
very
solid
brew
not
too
sweet
like
some
other
tripels
coughwestmallecough
very
well
done
i
didnt
jump
at
this
one
on
the
first
sip
but
subsequent
sips
have
drawn
me
in
deeper
its
a
very
intriguing
and
deeply
flavored
tripel
with
a
lot
more
going
on
than
i
expected
what
initially
struck
me
as
funky
smells
resulted
in
a
nice
doughy
character
that
made
it
rather
drinkable
with
just
enough
heft
and
body
to
be
satisfied
with
each
sip
d
a
fantastic
tripel
very
well
made
w
an
inspiration
that
is
hard
to
match
this
is
one
of
the
first
i
ever
had
and
it
is
great
to
have
a
bottle
again
after
several
years
the
drinkability
is
very
high
and
top
for
the
style
w
a
pleasant
fullness
w
out
the
harsh
heat
of
some
tripels
need
to
be
balanced
yet
show
a
full
malt
and
delicate
side
at
the
same
time
the
mellowed
malt
character
that
married
with
the
yeast
has
me
wondering
what
the
date
this
was
brewed
on
dprobably
my
least
favorite
chimay
but
still
very
good
and
drinkable
definaly
wont
be
my
last
one
d
a
very
nice
example
of
a
style
i
dont
reach
for
often
i
should
try
a
bottle
sometime
for
comparison
purposes
drinkability
this
is
the
first
in
the
chimay
series
that
i
have
tried
and
i
plan
on
trying
the
others
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
an
authentic
trappist
brew
this
my
first
time
delving
into
the
style
of
a
tripel
and
from
what
i
have
read
on
this
site
this
chimay
is
a
good
representative
of
that
style
my
favorite
of
the
chimay
offerrings
very
good
triple
i
need
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
because
i
dont
remember
the
exact
flavors
and
aroma
just
that
it
was
a
huge
hit
with
my
tasting
friend
and
i
update
tasted
again
on
draft
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
great
bannana
aroma
typical
candylike
sweetness
from
the
added
fermentable
sugars
clove
and
mild
citrus
fruit
on
the
tongue
and
nose
good
bitterness
and
clean
finish
alchohol
is
hard
to
detect
because
of
the
high
level
of
sweetness
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
cloudy
appearance
with
a
sweet
caramel
look
i
had
it
poured
on
draft
at
the
yard
house
in
san
diego
ca
it
was
served
in
a
goblet
style
glass
very
small
head
with
light
retention
for
the
abv
i
find
this
beer
to
sweet
with
no
trace
of
its
potency
smooth
rich
body
is
carried
by
hyperactive
carbonation
which
clears
the
palate
well
overall
a
big
bruiser
of
a
tripel
with
phenolics
being
overpowering
in
my
opinion
still
a
complex
palate
cleanser
when
paired
with
some
crab
and
artichoke
dip
on
crostini
and
a
side
of
fresh
strawberries
and
blueberries
one
of
the
great
tripels
and
with
good
reason
d
definitely
a
sipper
but
excellent
for
special
occasions
and
tastings
a
rusty
golden
beer
is
topped
off
by
a
twofinger
tan
head
which
fills
the
goblet
perfectly
retention
is
excellent
and
a
thick
consistent
lacing
is
left
being
smell
is
robust
and
is
full
of
big
fruits
malts
yeasts
and
alcohol
taste
is
complex
and
creamy
yet
somewhat
sharp
with
all
its
elements
blended
so
well
as
to
be
almost
ambiguous
i
make
out
grapes
raisins
yeasts
malts
some
hops
a
bit
of
candy
sweetness
laughytaffy
and
some
biscuity
goodness
carbonation
is
active
and
big
according
to
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
which
yeilds
a
drinkable
yet
tasty
classic
tripel
d
while
i
only
had
one
i
wish
i
had
more
the
8
is
somewhat
managable
given
others
in
the
same
style
excellent
to
be
the
pinnicle
of
a
session
or
a
great
place
to
start
d
very
refreshing
abv
well
hidden
extraordinarily
drinkable
while
perhaps
not
my
favorite
tripel
this
one
is
definitely
up
there
a
nice
tripel
but
not
my
favorite
it
drinks
well
and
is
a
nice
luxuries
beer
for
a
special
occasion
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
nice
zip
of
carbonation
one
of
the
beers
nicer
features
pours
a
very
hazy
ambergold
color
with
little
chunkies
floating
around
with
nice
amounts
of
foam
that
settle
into
a
small
cap
leaving
light
but
noticeable
lacing
light
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
very
effervescent
taste
is
of
light
apples
and
tropical
fruits
backed
up
by
sweet
malts
and
and
dry
hop
finish
very
clean
and
crisp
and
an
overall
enjoyable
brew
though
i
would
take
an
orval
over
this
one
if
given
the
choice
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
from
reading
others
reviews
i
would
hardly
call
the
tastes
i
got
sweet
at
all
this
actually
reminded
me
slightly
of
a
saison
but
of
course
it
is
not
not
a
world
beater
but
stands
up
well
highly
enjoyable
some
flavor
combinations
to
be
found
with
some
effort
10oz
pour
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
no
complaints
pours
a
cloudy
dark
honeyorange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
made
up
of
tiny
bubbles
amazing
head
retention
leaving
moderate
lacing
floral
fruity
yeast
mixes
with
the
fragrant
sweet
malt
with
some
vanilla
for
a
wonderful
aroma
up
front
flavor
is
of
the
fruity
yeast
leading
to
a
cirtus
hoppy
middle
finishing
with
a
vanilla
malty
taste
very
complex
and
balanced
creamy
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
to
full
body
great
drinkability
one
of
those
beers
where
you
say
wow
after
every
sip
note
this
is
called
cinq
cents
in
the
750ml
bottles
which
are
the
only
sizes
i
have
seen
them
in
excellent
in
the
mouth
and
for
drinkability
either
way
quite
smooth
crisp
and
wellcarbonated
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
well
balanced
overall
a
very
good
very
drinkable
brew
that
i
would
love
to
have
on
hand
all
the
time
along
with
their
absolutely
killer
blue
grande
reserve
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
pleasant
tripel
with
a
notable
malt
profile
not
too
common
for
the
style
cheers
d
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
finish
more
than
one
this
is
a
sipping
beer
but
definitely
lives
up
to
the
chimay
name
dthis
is
a
great
beer
well
rounded
all
together
really
nice
this
one
poured
a
cloudy
golden
amber
with
an
really
large
foamy
head
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
good
carbonation
smells
of
yeast
fruit
and
a
little
alcohol
taste
is
also
yeasty
with
fruit
and
spice
peppery
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
with
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
d
another
great
chimay
batch
and
rounded
off
the
trio
for
my
happy
mouth
poured
out
into
a
snifter
it
was
dark
goldlight
amber
color
semihazy
with
lots
of
carbonation
it
had
a
nice
thick
fluffy
head
about
two
fingers
thick
with
some
mild
lacing
but
it
does
thinn
out
fairly
quickly
it
has
a
sweet
and
spicy
aroma
mixed
in
with
some
malt
it
has
a
clean
crisp
feel
with
a
medium
body
it
has
a
really
spicy
flavor
to
it
with
a
slight
bitter
taste
as
it
reaches
the
back
of
your
mouth
and
there
are
some
sweet
undertones
throughout
and
finishes
with
a
semi
dry
aftertaste
it
really
warms
up
your
mouth
this
is
a
great
beer
a
modern
classic
along
with
the
rest
of
the
line
i
particularly
love
it
when
i
find
this
on
draft
overall
enjoyable
tripel
although
i
think
the
westmalle
has
a
bit
of
a
better
mouthfeel
and
taste
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
dissolves
fast
to
nothing
looks
okay
but
the
weak
head
is
nothing
special
nose
is
lots
of
spiciness
and
kind
of
a
rough
malt
character
taste
is
similar
although
that
rough
maltiness
comes
to
dominate
and
overwhelm
the
more
interesting
citrus
and
spices
kind
of
rolls
into
a
toostrong
hoppiness
as
well
body
is
solid
with
good
carbonation
this
one
was
far
superior
out
of
the
bottle
definitely
a
disappointment
this
is
actually
my
favorite
of
the
chimay
line
up
i
enjoyed
this
chilled
in
my
new
chimay
goblet
poured
a
murky
medium
brown
color
smelled
mildy
fruity
with
a
yeasty
essence
i
didnt
pour
the
sediment
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
into
the
glass
though
the
taste
was
crisp
and
well
balanced
with
an
astringent
feel
on
the
way
down
cheers
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
yielding
a
massive
three
fingers
worth
of
white
head
had
a
cloudy
dirty
brown
color
thats
not
to
appealing
with
fine
sediment
in
bottom
of
glass
scents
of
candied
cherries
raspberry
and
rum
very
nice
tastes
similar
to
the
smell
with
cherries
being
most
noticeable
and
maybe
some
cloves
as
well
smooth
texture
with
little
carbonation
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
id
surely
pick
up
another
i
tried
this
again
in
a
comparison
of
three
tripels
chimay
westmalle
and
fin
du
monde
it
seemed
to
have
far
more
in
common
with
the
westmalle
than
the
fin
du
monde
which
is
far
fruitier
and
spicier
however
it
seemed
to
be
drier
than
the
westmalle
and
had
less
of
a
grainy
aspect
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
nice
white
head
that
lasted
a
while
aroma
is
yeasty
and
is
also
fruity
flavor
is
crisp
clean
and
fruity
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
this
beer
disguises
the
8
alcohol
very
well
nice
beer
to
sip
and
savor
mfd
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
chewy
feel
that
coated
the
mouth
well
dry
finish
leaving
behind
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
great
beer
definitely
not
a
pounding
beer
its
too
good
to
drink
fast
sip
and
enjoy
this
almost
could
be
a
session
beer
it
is
very
easy
drinking
and
the
palatemouthfeel
cest
orgasmique
md
extremely
drinkable
wasnt
quite
sure
what
happened
to
my
bottle
once
i
poured
my
last
drop
the
mouthfeel
was
very
good
was
a
wee
bit
grainy
but
still
did
not
perturb
me
to
drink
this
bad
boy
down
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
of
this
tripel
in
my
stock
md
very
smooth
and
creamy
brew
still
prefer
the
premier
from
these
guys
but
this
is
a
very
strong
brew
the
tripel
does
well
here
but
will
it
be
enough
grand
réserve
will
close
out
the
chimay
invitational
later
tonight

with
a

of

carmalized

aroma
and
a
little
spice
medium
bodied
lots
of

light

flavor
spicy
slightly
funky
finish
a
little

alcohol
isnt

solid
beer
the
pour
is
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
nice
thick
two
finger
head
right
off
the
tap
the
smell
was
malt
dominated
but
i
caught
some
citrus
and
spices
it
tasted
great
a
well
balance
between
all
three
it
is
definitely
citrus
and
spice
driven
it
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
but
a
sipping
beer
you
dont
want
to
mess
with
this
beer
at
8
due
to
the
8
0
abv
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
great
session
beer
but
definitely
good
for
a
couple
a
very
interesting
brew
when
poured
a
white
creamy
head
was
created
which
dissipated
slowly
a
orange
cloudy
appearance
in
the
glass
the
nose
was
of
yeast
and
lavender
mouthfeel
was
well
rounded
a
distinct
taste
with
hints
of
lemon
and
lavender
definitely
from
the
wheat
a
medium
bitter
flavour
which
closed
with
a
sour
finish
the
beer
was
served
a
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
nice
twofinger
head
that
was
slow
to
diminish
and
left
great
lacing
aroma
was
loads
of
spice
yeast
and
some
sweet
fruits
the
beer
was
certainly
on
the
heavy
side
lots
of
alcohol
stickiness
this
one
is
enjoyable
but
definitely
a
sipper
this
poured
a
light
hazy
brown
with
lots
of
fluffy
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
perfume
and
apple
with
some
hops
it
had
a
strong
bitterness
and
yeast
flavor
up
front
with
a
short
and
mild
aftertaste
making
it
moderately
easy
to
drink
it
was
thinner
and
more
watery
than
the
red
but
also
had
little
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
bit
shallow
but
decent
d
the
funky
aroma
and
flavor
distracted
from
a
fine
brew
there
are
much
better
domestic
and
belgium
tripels
so
this
brew
will
remain
on
the
shelf
unless
it
is
offered
at
a
substantial
discount
i
highly
recommend
anyone
taste
this
in
similar
fashion
with
the
first
pour
or
pours
if
youve
got
the
750ml
being
gentle
leaving
an
inch
or
more
in
the
bottle
for
the
second
pour
it
shant
dissapoint
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
very
noticeable
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
not
as
impressive
as
the
immensely
complex
and
delicious
westmalle
triple
nevertheless
this
is
a
quality
beer
that
is
wellcrafted
and
highly
drinkable
not
to
mention
its
quite
easy
to
find
in
comparison
to
other
trappists
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
quite
satisfyting
d
a
sipper
and
a
good
one
at
that
fantastic
tripel
from
chimay
tmd
wholly
mediocre
way
too
much
carbonation
way
too
many
flavors
at
once
the
sweetnessbitterness
at
the
back
of
my
palates
borders
disgust
not
a
particularly
good
tasting
beer
no
hop
flavor
to
note
just
sweet
and
bitter
and
not
very
good
dnot
nearly
as
drinkable
as
some
other
tripelsbut
overall
a
great
display
of
a
wonderful
style
good
drinkability
for
the
abv
d
no
my
favorite
i
would
not
go
out
to
get
this
one
again
especial
at
the
price
point
drinkability
very
solid
wheat
beer
sutble
though
not
going
to
knock
you
over
the
moon
with
flavor
d
drinkability
is
average
at
best
it
goes
down
easy
but
overall
i
was
not
impressed
and
will
not
have
another
a
beautiful
beer
all
in
all
great
belgian
trippel
the
alchohol
hides
very
well
i
think
the
chimay
red
is
my
fav
however
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
i
need
to
compare
it
to
the
bottle
but
on
draft
its
simply
amazing
d
perfectly
drinkable
and
complex
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
this
is
a
world
class
beer
i
went
down
to
the
headkeeper
tonight
and
bought
a
chimay
gift
pack
with
three
bottles
one
each
of
the
triple
premiere
and
grande
reserve
along
with
a
goblet
i
figured
id
start
of
with
the
triple
it
being
the
lightest
weighing
in
at
8
abv
it
poured
into
the
goblet
with
a
nice
foamy
head
the
head
disappeared
quickly
leaving
a
line
of
bubbles
along
the
inside
rim
of
the
glass
the
scent
was
the
scent
was
musky
like
a
farm
house
ale
but
faint
fortunately
what
it
lacked
in
aroma
it
made
up
for
in
flavor
this
is
a
bold
triple
with
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
it
is
a
heavenly
mix
of
both
fruit
and
spice
with
a
smooth
finish
that
doesnt
vanish
right
away
its
funny
though
a
triple
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
pinot
grigio
not
that
i
would
ever
admit
to
drinking
one
it
isnt
a
deep
dark
ale
but
is
complex
and
light
on
the
palate
all
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
good
bit
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
which
i
made
didnt
end
up
going
into
the
goblet
chimay
is
an
awesome
belgium
beer
and
i
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
two
dall
in
all
this
is
a
good
drink
it
is
delicious
and
goes
down
smooth
had
a
chimay
white
on
tap
at
redline
in
harvard
square
this
past
saturday
night
came
served
in
the
proper
chalice
pours
with
a
nice
fizzy
head
and
with
a
sunset
yellow
color
smells
like
a
classic
tripel
with
notes
of
spice
and
hay
on
the
nose
tastewise
its
quite
good
one
of
the
classic
examples
of
the
style
the
only
thing
that
i
think
it
needs
is
that
added
oomph
that
some
tripels
hit
you
with
on
the
palate
but
i
must
admit
there
are
a
lot
more
adventurous
tripels
out
there
when
compared
to
chimay
white
otherwise
this
is
a
great
choice
now
that
you
can
find
chimay
in
more
and
more
bars
when
you
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
at
a
place
with
an
average
selection
this
is
a
cant
lose
d
this
would
be
a
highly
touted
beer
in
my
book
without
the
addition
of
so
many
saaz
hops
way
too
earthy
for
my
palate
chimay
less
saaz
please
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
if
you
enjoy
tripelscheck
it
out
the
date
stamp
on
the
cork
is
0307
the
beer
was
poured
into
chimay
glasses
and
produced
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
head
eventually
dropped
to
14
inch
but
never
faded
totally
the
beer
is
a
highlycarbonated
bright
amber
orange
and
its
quite
attractive
food
should
please
the
eyes
as
well
as
the
palate
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
hoppy
with
a
underlying
sweet
malt
and
hints
of
fruit
the
aromas
are
precursors
to
the
flavor
palette
a
complex
blend
of
hoppy
fruity
and
yeasty
there
are
a
range
of
spices
lingering
in
there
as
well
pepper
cinnamon
are
noted
a
faint
candy
sweetness
waits
in
the
background
the
aftertaste
has
some
drying
bitterness
with
peachy
fruitiness
in
the
end
i
found
the
alcohol
to
be
very
wellmasked
d
overall
thought
that
the
bottled
really
compared
in
comparison
to
the
on
tap
version
other
than
this
one
was
a
lot
better
to
look
at
this
one
on
the
whole
just
did
not
really
do
it
for
me
and
have
to
say
i
was
happy
i
bought
just
a
little
bottle
id
much
rather
spend
on
my
money
on
a
westmalle
tripel
as
i
thought
that
one
was
much
better
personally
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
find
it
id
love
to
taste
this
one
side
by
side
with
la
fin
du
monde
unibroue
as
i
feel
they
have
a
very
similar
profile
bottle
in
a
chimay
glass
aroma
of
floral
hops
and
yeast
very
cloudy
orange
with
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
coming
up
though
bottom
of
glass
light
lacing
flavor
a
mix
of
biterness
yeast
spicy
hops
and
alcohol
with
a
definite
belgian
character
in
the
background
effervescent
mouthfeel
fairly
light
body
dry
finish
but
had
a
slightly
sweet
bitter
aftertaste
with
hints
of
alcohol
a
very
nice
tripel
verdict
a
strong
tripel
that
is
truer
to
style
than
other
tripels
ive
had
you
have
to
leave
it
up
to
the
trappist
monks
to
create
a
beer
that
is
so
complex
its
nearly
heavenly
in
stature
a
great
triple
d
although
it
is
a
good
beer
i
cant
see
making
this
one
a
regular
in
my
drinking
rotation
it
would
be
nice
as
an
occasional
treat
but
after
the
first
one
id
order
something
else
tvery
sharp
with
some
apple
lots
of
carbonation
feel
in
the
mouth
there
is
some
yeasty
and
malty
tastes
i
enjoy
the
taste
cant
put
anything
more
to
it
a
very
nice
triple
but
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
triples
compared
to
other
trappist
ales
appearance
is
the
typical
triple
yellow
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
very
dry
and
not
as
fruity
as
i
would
have
liked
i
personally
would
select
one
of
chimays
two
other
common
offerings
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
lightness
in
body
contributes
to
the
booziness
taking
over
the
palate
with
too
much
warmth
d
i
would
come
back
to
this
one
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
i
still
hold
strong
that
the
blue
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
chimay
offerings
and
this
is
the
weakest
after
many
attempts
im
not
sure
what
im
missing
just
not
my
thing
i
guess
i
love
triples
and
this
one
while
not
being
my
absolute
favorite
gouden
carolus
westmalle
and
st
bernardus
is
still
very
good
and
i
will
definitely
have
more
of
it
in
the
future
these
monasteries
can
make
some
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
will
be
getting
a
lot
more
of
this
as
there
are
other
tripels
i
like
more
but
it
is
a
very
pleasant
drop
nonetheless
overall
a
tasty
beer
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
a
solid
choice
no
real
flaws
i
bought
this
in
a
gift
pack
of
all
three
chimays
and
i
was
not
impressed
with
any
of
thembut
this
one
was
better
then
the
redbut
not
as
good
as
the
bluehaving
said
that
i
myself
will
not
be
buying
any
of
them
againbut
then
againi
prefer
stouts
over
most
alesso
maybe
i
am
not
the
best
judge
of
this
style
poured
into
my
chimay
chalice
it
poured
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
left
a
decent
amount
of
laceing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
malts
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
of
malts
and
alcohol
at
first
and
then
giving
way
to
some
earthy
spices
the
overall
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
light
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
the
best
one
from
chimay
but
like
the
other
two
i
could
enjoy
this
one
over
and
over
overall
another
reason
why
chimay
is
an
institution
upon
itself
another
belgian
brew
that
doesnt
disappoint
this
might
be
my
favorite
triple
there
is
lots
of
peppermint
that
makes
for
a
unique
tasting
beer
d
not
very
drinkable
with
respect
to
quantity
given
the
abv
but
very
enjoyable
after
a
long
day
of
work
clean
and
refreshing
a
wonderful
tripel
one
all
should
be
judged
by
served
in
my
chimay
chalice
poured
a
hazy
burntorange
with
two
fingers
of
foam
eventually
settling
into
a
quarterinch
consistent
skim
ample
belgian
lacing
during
the
tasting
with
excellent
adherence
nose
presented
immediately
with
the
scent
of
alcohol
followed
by
a
mild
scent
of
dark
fruit
and
yeast
taste
similar
to
nose
with
the
addition
of
the
faint
presence
of
apples
but
much
less
pronounced
followed
by
a
crisp
citrusytart
finish
tingly
mouthfeel
not
surprising
given
the
abundant
head
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
tripel
however
at
8
abv
it
can
pack
a
punch
truly
an
incredible
tasting
experience
and
my
favorite
of
the
three
given
that
my
mouth
eventually
tires
of
hops
and
the
8
keeps
me
from
having
more
than
a
few
drinkability
in
the
repetitive
sense
must
be
scored
low
but
given
how
much
i
like
drinking
one
of
these
ill
average
the
two
and
call
it
pretty
good
drinkability
is
partly
there
at
8
its
not
something
that
youll
die
from
splitting
a
sixpack
from
but
im
not
sure
if
this
is
something
you
would
want
to
its
a
beer
that
once
you
start
drinking
and
really
if
youre
not
reviewing
a
beer
who
is
going
to
take
23
minutes
to
analyze
the
aromas
of
the
beer
giving
it
time
to
warm
and
release
flavors
i
can
see
it
becoming
a
beer
that
you
might
actually
become
a
little
bored
with
and
at
the
same
time
since
it
is
such
a
subtle
onedimension
beer
a
beer
that
you
could
really
start
to
drink
quickly
as
your
consumption
increases
jesus
i
dont
know
i
feel
like
this
beer
misses
somewhere
or
maybe
i
missed
somewhere
maybe
i
just
didnt
feel
it
with
this
beer
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
maybe
my
palate
was
shot
maybe
if
i
have
to
write
three
rhetorical
questions
to
justify
a
low
score
i
just
didnt
like
a
beer
as
much
as
i
thought
i
should
have
maybe
d
a
beer
that
always
kicks
my
ass
when
i
want
this
i
want
only
one
in
some
ways
i
like
this
better
than
the
westmalle
tripel
but
it
isnt
as
drinkable
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
reputation
its
definitely
worth
a
try
sometime
i
must
have
missed
the
boat
with
this
one
last
night
i
tried
the
second
one
of
the
two
i
bought
this
past
saturday
it
was
syrupy
thick
and
sickeningly
sweet
and
after
two
sips
i
gave
it
to
my
buddy
wholl
drink
anything
if
this
was
the
last
beer
on
the
planet
id
stay
sober
with
little
problem
this
beer
was
terrible
i
will
not
subject
myself
to
this
again
d
i
did
not
like
this
much
too
bready
seems
like
it
is
a
beer
that
had
gone
bad
chimay
tripel
is
splendid
a
great
nightcap
on
a
cold
night
by
the
fire
life
is
good
mouthfeel
has
a
carbonated
bite
that
stings
the
back
of
the
throat
on
the
way
down
taste
is
extremely
carbonated
and
has
a
foul
aftertaste
this
one
is
losing
me
fast
the
tripel
itself
has
a
very
unusual
and
hard
to
describe
taste
not
very
pleasing
at
all
and
not
what
ive
come
to
expect
based
on
previous
reviews
going
going
at
5
49
a
bottle
definitely
overpriced
and
im
certainly
glad
i
only
purchased
one
my
first
and
last
chimaygone
i
am
not
going
to
slam
this
but
this
certainly
ranks
among
the
least
favorite
tripels
ive
had
too
bad
as
i
was
expecting
much
more
the
valdieu
tripel
i
had
yesterday
was
far
superior
in
every
aspect
but
the
head
i
think
ill
pop
one
to
get
the
taste
of
this
out
of
my
mouth
bottle
poured
into
wide
rimmed
goblet
color
is
a
cloudy
pale
orange
with
white
foam
which
dissipates
good
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
with
the
heavy
esters
that
you
expect
from
a
belgian
brew
flavor
matches
the
aroma
with
the
fruity
almost
chewy
esters
mixing
with
the
pale
malt
and
gentle
hop
bitterness
finishes
smooth
and
well
balanced
a
true
classic
poured
a
nice
amberorange
color
with
fantastic
head
and
nice
lacing
it
has
a
great
citrus
scent
very
fruity
flowery
and
aromatic
with
a
little
bit
of
sour
undertone
nice
taste
an
excellent
blend
nice
and
malty
with
nice
fruity
hits
such
as
orange
and
other
flavors
such
as
butterscotch
goes
down
great
for
an
8
i
love
all
the
chimays
and
while
the
red
is
my
favorite
ill
never
say
no
to
a
white
i
absolutely
loved
chimay
red
and
this
one
was
equally
amazing
chimay
may
just
be
my
favorite
all
time
brew
the
white
tripel
is
outstanding
pours
a
hazy
light
brown
off
color
cloudy
appearance
with
decent
head
smell
is
very
fruity
with
a
rich
aroma
with
bananas
and
fruit
tase
is
exceptional
fruity
with
citrus
aftertones
banana
flavor
and
with
an
8
abv
it
is
hardly
noticeable
behind
a
conglomeration
of
wonderful
flavors
that
melt
in
the
mouth
amazing
brew
definietly
recommended
good
stuff
taste
is
nice
and
dry
balanced
bitterness
and
some
spicy
and
fruity
notes
from
the
yeast
mouthfeel
is
light
and
medium
high
carbonation
makes
this
one
quite
refreshing
this
one
could
be
dangerous
because
it
is
fairly
strong
8
but
is
very
lightbodied
and
drinkable
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
is
not
too
expensive
and
widely
availableis
there
any
reason
not
to
drink
this
beer
final
note
ive
had
a
few
tripels
and
found
the
others
to
have
been
much
sweeter
than
this
brew
was
i
like
bitterness
and
i
like
this
tripel
i
tried
this
one
at
tapwerks
in
okc
i
happen
to
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
but
not
like
the
grand
reserve
i
was
extremely
impressed
with
the
grand
reserve
but
i
have
to
admit
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
when
i
drank
this
one
thinking
it
would
have
the
same
quality
as
the
gr
but
i
did
enjoy
it
nontheless
i
hate
saying
it
but
chimay
white
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
i
desire
a
little
more
of
everything
nose
pronounced
flavor
and
body
ive
had
this
beer
probably
dozens
of
time
over
the
years
and
until
know
ive
always
considered
it
a
benchmark
triple
i
dont
anymore
drinkability
usually
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
much
higher
but
now
it
is
really
a
difficulty
to
drink
i
suppose
it
would
be
good
to
watch
light
sources
on
these
beers
but
the
location
i
bought
at
had
no
flourescents
around
at
all
so
i
just
cant
explain
this
skunking
some
nice
malt
sweetness
particularly
honey
with
some
sour
apple
cloves
and
some
refreshing
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
a
touch
different
really
smooth
and
well
carbonated
it
is
surprisingly
easy
to
sit
back
and
drink
for
the
high
alcohol
gives
karmeliet
a
run
for
my
favourite
triple
overall
still
decent
but
the
medicinal
notes
cut
down
on
drinkability
somewhat
watch
out
the
8
abv
is
cleverly
hidden
overall
a
decent
brew
from
belgium
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
at
some
point
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
thick
pillowy
three
to
four
finger
head
that
barely
diminishes
atop
the
hazy
golden
liquid
in
my
chalice
the
smell
is
sweet
but
astringenty
with
distinct
clove
note
the
taste
is
dry
at
first
with
a
beautiful
almost
butterscotch
creamyness
perhaps
from
diacetyl
that
fades
into
a
light
malty
sweetness
this
beer
finds
an
amazing
balance
between
malt
and
candied
sugar
the
body
is
light
medium
with
crisp
almost
sharp
carbonation
and
lovely
smooth
finish
this
beer
spills
down
my
throat
like
solf
silky
chocolate
milk
this
is
a
great
beer
bottle
poured
hazy
gold
big
pillowy
head
aromas
of
fruit
yeast
and
spices
nice
clean
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
flavors
of
sweet
fruit
and
malt
with
a
lite
bitter
hop
finish
this
is
a
soild
triple
not
one
of
my
personal
best
but
solid
none
the
less
once
again
this
is
a
standard
beer
a
good
example
of
a
trippel
but
nothing
special
or
terribly
unique
pours
clear
yellow
and
bubbly
as
hell
good
nose
for
a
trippel
but
the
taste
seems
almost
false
it
feels
like
a
they
are
faking
it
some
how
with
the
malts
i
dont
know
how
to
explain
this
but
it
is
like
a
mock
trippel
taste
like
sugar
free
candy
as
opposed
to
candy
dont
let
this
take
away
from
it
though
as
it
is
still
better
than
any
american
brewed
trippel
i
have
had
as
of
yet
good
buy
d
the
orange
peel
tang
does
get
a
little
tiring
after
a
while
but
its
an
enjoyable
beer
and
i
could
certainly
stand
to
drink
a
few
of
these
drinkability
a
great
treat
in
the
world
of
beer
challenges
the
drinker
but
remains
very
refreshing
d
this
is
my
first
tripel
and
while
i
like
the
bleu
i
think
this
is
a
bit
more
drinkable
though
this
is
certainly
a
more
complex
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chalice
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
goldorange
color
forming
a
1
inch
white
head
medium
lacing
coats
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
sugar
and
fruit
aromas
the
taste
is
a
complex
mix
of
the
yeast
dark
fruit
flavors
light
sugar
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
there
are
more
flavors
present
but
these
are
the
most
pronounced
medium
and
slightly
harsh
mouthfeel
not
as
smooth
as
expected
but
not
terrible
good
flavor
makes
for
a
drinkable
tripel
but
the
higher
abv
keeps
this
from
being
a
sessionable
ale
overall
not
a
bad
tripel
i
guess
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
the
chimay
name
but
i
guess
they
cant
be
tops
in
everything
still
its
a
good
brew
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
d
a
good
tripel
by
chimay
i
liked
the
beer
overall
but
didnt
really
pique
my
interest
id
definitely
have
it
again
though
picked
this
one
up
today
poured
out
a
very
lovely
golden
color
murky
nice
fluffly
head
instant
smells
of
yeast
flowers
hay
lots
of
hoppyness
taste
bitter
orange
fruits
very
peppery
can
feel
the
alcohol
slightly
in
the
back
of
my
throat
mouthfeel
is
tart
slightly
thin
this
beer
is
not
at
all
as
sweet
as
i
had
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
appreciate
the
tartness
a
nice
tripel
d
this
was
ok
but
i
liked
the
grand
reserve
much
more
there
just
wasnt
enough
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
for
me
because
the
hops
had
no
distinctive
flavor
i
like
the
flavor
of
dubbels
more
this
is
just
a
bit
too
subtle
to
me
fresh
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
tripel
most
american
versions
these
days
seem
to
want
to
head
into
the
10
category
which
unless
done
perfectly
becomes
a
tough
brew
this
beer
even
with
chimays
growth
remains
a
wondeful
drinker
with
a
nice
kick
its
malt
character
is
soft
and
bready
somewhat
like
a
fresh
baked
sugar
cookie
with
a
gentle
touch
of
noble
hops
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
tad
chalky
as
happens
with
many
belgians
with
the
sugar
addition
but
the
chimay
is
always
more
subtle
on
the
sugar
adjunct
with
a
nice
pilsner
base
end
run
on
sentence
i
truly
enjoy
this
brew
drinkability
a
very
nice
tripel
that
avoids
the
sweetness
of
some
of
the
other
versions
of
the
style
but
i
am
not
crazy
about
the
herbacious
quality
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
something
that
comes
in
at
8
abv
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
good
plenty
of
carbonation
as
well
all
in
all
a
fine
example
of
a
classic
style
taste
and
smell
is
of
belgian
yeast
sweet
malt
some
citrus
overtones
more
lemony
than
anything
else
and
some
spices
coriander
tastes
good
solid
but
at
this
price
there
are
other
brews
id
prefer
still
very
solid
drinkability
although
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
kind
of
enjoyed
it
would
have
it
again
but
not
too
frequently
poured
a
stubby
into
a
chimay
chalice
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
nice
inch
head
that
stayed
around
for
quite
a
while
left
some
beautiful
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
was
fruity
with
a
nice
hoppy
blending
tasted
sweet
nice
malty
front
to
the
beer
with
lemon
and
other
citrus
fruits
mingling
with
a
hoppy
sensation
at
the
back
of
the
beer
definitly
on
the
higher
end
of
the
carbonation
spectrum
up
to
chimays
standards
great
beer
cannot
say
anything
bad
about
any
trappist
beer
because
they
have
all
been
good
so
far
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
popular
all
over
the
place
this
was
quite
good
for
my
first
experience
with
chimay
d
drinkable
i
would
say
but
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
chimays
all
others
are
more
drinkable
and
more
worth
the
money
hmm
hoppier
than
most
tripels
ive
tried
definitely
has
the
trappist
yeast
character
of
subtle
earthy
spice
that
mix
with
the
hops
into
a
fantastic
aftertaste
unfortunately
the
main
flavor
is
a
little
too
mellow
with
the
malt
leaving
most
of
the
taste
to
the
end
of
the
drink

3
beers
recommended
second
part
of
my
chimay
trilogy
pours
a

color
with
nice
2
finger

head
slowly
decipates
and
leaves
a
layer
behind
for
the

of
the
beer
good

not

smell
is
of
yeast
fruit
some
alcohol
and
a
grainbreadlike
smell
taste
is
great
taste
is

apple
alcohol
some

some
bitterness
very
complex
moderate
carbonation
leaves
a
nice
clean
mouthfeel
with
a
plesant
aftertaste
overall
a
very
good
beer
so
far
much
more
to
my
liking
than
the
red
blue
is
next
d
a
really
great
brew
w
well
balanced
flavors
a
little
bit
much
on
the
alcohol
flavors
but
i
could
chug
this
all
day
very
refreshing
for
a
beer
with
high
alcohol
content
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
a
dark
cloudy
gold
with
a
decent
creamy
head
that
lasted
nicely
light
lacing
smelled
inviting
but
subtle
for
the
style
spice
citrus
yeast
diacetyl
all
present
but
mild
overall
a
bit
boozy
to
the
tongue
perhaps
because
the
mild
flavors
cant
quite
cover
up
the
alcohol
the
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
is
pulled
off
but
the
whole
thing
feels
off
even
though
i
think
this
is
the
least
of
chimays
offerings
and
that
it
doesnt
stack
up
against
other
notable
tripels
its
still
a
very
good
beer
to
sip
on
if
its
whats
available
d
not
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
dont
know
exactly
where
this
beer
fits
into
my
life
is
it
an
afterdinner
beer
not
really
with
food
cant
think
of
a
perfect
pairing
hot
summer
day
not
so
much
maybe
ill
find
that
perfect
moment
sometime
this
poured
an
opaque
amber
with
golden
highlights
and
a
two
finger
head
that
lingered
for
a
little
while
the
smell
is
a
little
yeasty
and
reminds
me
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
a
bit
of
a
sweet
fruity
scent
the
taste
is
very
rich
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
bit
of
an
alcohol
presence
and
a
nice
little
hops
bite
towards
the
end
that
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
theres
a
reason
everyone
raves
about
this
beer
its
really
damn
good
for
the
price
its
very
drinkable
and
i
would
expect
that
i
could
go
through
a
couple
of
the
larger
bottles
a
week
if
it
was
in
my
budget
poured
from
a
small
11
2
oz
bottle
with
no
apparent
freshness
date
into
the
chimay
glass
it
was
a
hazy
pale
orangish
white
with
a
soft
foam
head
that
left
no
lacing
it
smells
of
apples
and
a
yeasty
aroma
the
flavor
is
spicy
with
a
little
nutmeg
coming
through
it
was
sweet
and
a
little
bit
tart
in
the
mouth
it
was
fast
to
the
punch
this
was
the
first
time
with
this
legit
tripel
i
will
definitely
come
back
as
i
venture
more
into
the
belgian
styles
mouthfeel
is
noticeably
belgian
with
the
tight
crisp
carbonation
drinkability
is
a
bit
difficult
due
to
the
spices
but
the
alcohol
is
deceivingly
absent
as
with
many
belgian
brews
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
a
solid
offering
and
easily
found
at
local
bottle
shops
d
not
drinkable
for
me
the
taste
is
too
rich
and
fruity
and
the
astringency
makes
the
drink
a
pain
to
put
down
ill
sadly
be
pouring
the
rest
of
this
out
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
boozey
very
drinkable
but
this
one
is
a
sipper
to
be
savored
d
smooth
good
but
probably
wont
go
back
to
it
o
very
drinkable
the
abv
goes
well
with
this
beer
very
complex
alcoholic
and
a
sipper
packs
a
punch
but
so
tasty
and
a
great
tripel
price
is
an
issue
as
with
most
belgians
but
id
be
happy
to
oblige
now
and
then
my
second
chimay
blanche
first
was
a
draft
this
one
from
a
bottle
dated
2006
hazy
golden
pour
nice
frothy
white
head
flavor
was
slight
fruit
and
slight
flowery
clove
sort
of
spicy
nice
beer
with
no
real
taste
of
alcohol
present
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
smoother
on
draft
than
in
bottle
very
drinkable
beer
just
like
the
other
two
regular
beers
the
monks
brew
at
chimay
quite
pale
orangish
yellow
with
a
large
fluffy
head
instant
aromas
of
floral
hops
light
citrus
and
mild
spice
mildly
yeasty
surprisingly
light
but
not
watery
mouthfeel
with
less
fruit
character
and
more
maltyeast
than
in
the
aroma
spiciness
remains
aided
by
the
prickly
carbonation
hint
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
very
refreshing
for
an
8
beer
had
this
one
on
tap
at
brassarie
v
in
madison
poured
in
to
a
chimay
goblet
appearance
was
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
strong
fruit
and
floral
aromas
a
smooth
and
nice
tasting
trippel
with
a
little
bit
less
yeast
presence
than
some
others
a
solid
brew
but
at
around
8
one
or
two
is
enough
i
happened
to
nearly
finish
off
the
keg
so
the
bartender
gave
me
a
pint
glass
of
the
leftover
head
that
settled
into
a
nice
amount
of
beer
after
two
of
these
i
was
ready
to
call
it
a
night
i
tried
this
beer
on
september
13
2007
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
hazy
brown
with
a
large
generous
whitish
head
the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
malt
and
fruits
i
was
expecting
yeast
it
was
not
there
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
crisp
with
high
carbonation
the
flavour
was
malty
with
some
bread
dpretty
good
tripel
but
no
where
close
to
the
premiere
which
i
consider
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
if
you
are
tripel
lover
this
is
must
tryhave
everyone
who
loves
beer
should
make
sure
they
drink
all
of
the
chimay
beers
i
really
like
tripels
and
some
golden
strongs
but
this
one
is
superb
it
seems
to
hit
that
middle
ground
of
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
dry
all
i
can
say
is
wow
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
has
many
of
the
nose
taste
and
mouthfeel
characteristics
of
a
belgian
tripel
but
it
was
still
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
taste
not
a
hoppy
or
green
bitter
but
just
not
as
sweet
sweet
as
i
like
in
a
tripel
its
certainly
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
one
if
out
and
about
but
if
given
a
choice
between
this
and
many
of
the
other
great
tripel
style
beers
out
there
id
probably
choose
something
else
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
because
it
is
a
slightly
more
aggresive
brew
d
a
tasty
beer
that
is
deceptive
with
its
8
abv
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
yet
not
too
overpowering
pretty
solid
but
it
likely
would
improve
with
age
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
because
i
enjoyed
chimay
red
so
much
but
oh
well
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
great
beer
to
stick
with
and
drink
for
a
long
time
and
drink
slowly
its
one
of
the
better
tripels
that
ive
had
my
impression
is
that
the
alcohol
is
still
front
and
centre
in
this
sample
and
that
aging
might
bring
a
smoother
delivery
and
finish
if
i
cellar
this
for
a
year
or
three
it
might
pay
huge
dividends
guess
ill
have
to
try
that
as
this
rating
is
probably
a
touch
lower
than
it
might
be
d
chimay
are
totally
some
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
and
they
all
earn
a
super
duper
from
me
altho
the
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
aroma
it
is
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
d
this
was
a
very
delicious
brew
but
after
one
i
was
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
this
was
excellent
and
my
first
trappist
beer
i
will
definately
have
this
one
again
i
even
bought
myself
a
chimay
chalice
to
enjoy
it
in
at
home
effervescent
at
first
and
chalky
to
finish
d
eh
good
but
a
bit
drab
other
than
the
spice
i
guess
i
expected
more
out
of
this
beer
not
chimays
best
especially
when
sitting
next
to
their
fantastic
blue
label
however
its
a
good
tripel
and
packs
quite
a
punch
this
one
may
require
some
aging
to
smooth
out
the
edges
but
was
pretty
good
fresh
stubby
bottle
from
cardinal
i
love
the
red
cap
chimay
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
white
cap
i
must
note
that
i
do
not
care
for
this
particular
style
in
general
the
conditioning
usually
boats
me
too
much
however
the
effects
are
usually
stellar
at
any
rate
i
poured
this
extremely
slow
still
yielded
a
2
finger
lasting
head
to
me
this
was
all
spice
taste
was
mostly
crushed
black
pepper
with
a
hint
of
orange
underneath
this
ale
probably
has
the
biggest
contrast
between
the
initial
taste
and
the
back
end
its
a
good
quality
brew
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
palate
was
soapy
and
resinous
earthy
spicy
yeasty
warm
flavor
great
beer
fantastic
mouthfeel
with
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
smooth
and
drinkable
in
fact
i
could
drink
this
all
day
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
well
balanced
flavorful
excellent
i
really
enjoy
this
tripel
not
my
favorite
but
still
an
awesome
beer
much
to
my
surprise
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
more
than
the
westmalle
tripel
i
started
the
session
with
this
is
an
outstanding
tripel
that
really
shone
through
ontap
it
paired
perfectly
with
my
morbier
cheese
plate
a
wonderful
classic
beer
one
of
my
favorites
a
solid
tripel
from
one
of
the
few
remaining
trappist
breweries
an
enjoyable
treat
when
in
the
mood
for
a
slightly
heavier
bodied
tripel
pours
out
a
honey
color
with
a
white
head
that
recedes
a
bit
too
quickly
leaving
no
lace
smell
is
bready
with
honey
apricots
both
fresh
and
dried
alcohol
and
herbal
hop
flavor
starts
off
with
an
almost
chewy
malt
flavor
doused
with
honey
and
fruit
which
is
followed
by
some
yeasty
spice
and
alcohol
in
the
middle
and
finishes
dry
with
a
touch
of
grain
and
some
herbaltea
hops
that
give
off
a
solid
bitterness
that
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
feels
lively
and
light
in
weight
yet
has
solid
body
and
almost
coats
the
tongue
in
malt
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
the
only
negative
i
could
say
about
this
is
that
it
is
very
expensive
i
paid
9
61
at
casknkeg
in
mystic
for
a
75cl
bottle
i
can
get
a
33cl
bottle
at
gordons
in
new
london
go
there
but
im
sure
it
is
still
a
premium
beer
but
it
is
so
worth
it
drinkability
excellent
respresentation
of
a
triple
i
found
this
offering
very
balanced
would
would
put
this
on
the
short
list
of
excellent
tripels
d
great
flavor
nice
balance
easy
drinking
for
8
tasty
recommended
i
see
why
chimay
is
so
popular
drinkability
light
robust
very
drinkable
i
would
even
say
sessionable
if
this
wasnt
8
alcohol
neither
too
sweet
nor
too
spicy
extremely
wellbalanced
not
sure
what
to
say
about
this
that
hasnt
been
said
ive
had
the
bottle
and
the
glass
and
prefer
the
glass
on
tap
smooth
tasting
lightest
tasting
of
the
three
but
stronger
than
red
overall
its
just
a
damn
good
beer
the
color
was
clear
and
tan
as
it
poured
from
the
bottle
and
is
orangetan
in
the
glass
there
was
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
was
both
fruity
and
bready
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
quite
complex
with
a
fruity
tartness
up
front
bready
malt
flavors
and
very
pleasant
almost
brown
sugary
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
i
usually
find
this
style
of
beer
not
to
be
very
drinkablei
can
usually
only
handle
enjoy
about
8
oz
at
the
most
but
this
is
very
drinkable
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
within
this
style
finally
a
trappist
on
tap
a
lighter
amberish
color
with
a
nice
white
head
retention
smooth
with
a
small
dry
end
i
think
i
could
drink
this
all
day
it
is
mellow
enough
to
go
with
whatever
you
are
doing
or
eating
i
just
hop
to
see
the
other
chimays
on
tap
soon
or
even
other
trappists
are
living
witnesses
tried
and
loved
by
many
a
really
good
beer
the
best
tripel
out
there
thats
not
for
me
to
say
at
this
point
should
certainly
be
paired
with
some
type
of
food
maybe
take
the
bros
offerings
to
task
give
the
brew
a
little
time
to
warm
after
the
first
taste
and
it
should
go
a
long
way
towards
pleasing
d
not
the
best
tripel
out
there
but
a
classic
nonetheless
if
you
havent
tried
chimay
you
should
use
your
own
judgement
to
see
if
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
this
is
a
very
good
reliable
brew
this
is
my
favorite
chimay
but
that
is
due
to
tripels
being
my
favorite
style
of
brew
d
i
think
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
pair
you
could
have
a
mediocre
meal
and
this
beer
would
certainly
improve
your
lot
although
not
the
best
tripel
its
certainly
the
easiest
to
drink
without
worrying
about
pairing
d
not
as
good
as
the
red
or
even
close
to
the
blue
but
still
a
good
brew
from
a
great
brewer
d
very
drinkable
nice
flavors
to
go
along
with
a
smooth
beer
with
good
complexity
a
very
good
triple
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
dont
really
notice
the
alcohol
very
nice
indeed
id
recommend
the
grand
reserve
blue
chimay
over
this
one
drinkability
disappointing
after
the
rest
of
the
chimays
but
i
have
high
standards
for
this
style
and
this
one
didnt
fit
my
expectations
perhaps
im
not
giving
it
a
fair
shake
in
any
case
nothing
can
disappoint
me
today
im
done
poured
in
a
cloudy
honeyyellow
colour
and
with
a
good
creamy
head
the
smell
was
basically
of
bread
yeast
and
sugar
the
taste
was
bitter
not
too
sweet
with
notes
of
bread
yeast
and
alcohol
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
since
it
did
not
really
measure
up
to
most
of
the
trappists
i
have
tasted
nevertheless
its
a
good
brew
pours
a
cloudy
hazy
opaque
color
with
insane
amount
of
carbonation
the
cork
nearly
killed
me
a
frothy
white
head
is
large
and
not
going
anywhere
smell
of
yeast
and
fruit
are
clearly
evident
a
hop
note
is
also
prevalent
before
i
drink
it
you
can
see
the
sediment
start
to
settle
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
still
tons
of
carbonation
tastes
good
but
not
great
not
10
dollars
a
bottle
good
either
floral
notes
are
in
the
beer
with
a
warm
alcohol
presence
unfortunately
it
tastes
a
bit
more
watery
than
it
should
at
8
i
could
still
down
a
few
of
these
so
the
drinkability
is
high
even
though
its
higher
than
average
abv
its
a
good
beer
i
heard
great
things
from
it
if
it
were
cheaper
id
probably
be
a
bigger
fan
but
10
bucks
for
25
4
onces
is
kinda
high
but
maybe
im
just
a
cheapskate
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
very
large
white
head
good
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
and
some
spice
also
apples
the
taste
is
yeasty
peppery
and
ends
with
hoppy
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
acidic
making
the
overall
taste
not
very
appealing
to
me
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
quite
carbonated
drinkability
is
not
great
due
to
the
aftertaste
overall
my
least
favorite
chimay
a
very
pleasant
beer
poured
an
11
2
oz
into
a
chimay
chalice
the
first
from
a
chimay
sampler
starts
out
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
lingered
throughout
its
appearance
was
quite
dense
a
very
good
quality
i
picked
up
lots
of
fruit
coupled
with
hoppiness
in
the
smell
definitely
enticing
i
believe
i
enjoyed
the
smell
a
little
more
than
the
taste
it
presented
the
alchohol
definitely
makes
itself
known
behind
the
increasing
hops
toward
the
end
as
it
warms
overall
the
monks
at
chimay
produce
a
quality
tripel
one
that
i
will
definitely
enjoy
again
but
with
two
more
chimays
to
go
and
the
talk
ive
heard
the
bar
is
rising
ahhh
i
just
finished
a
bottle
of
the
chimay
cinq
cents
or
white
as
i
call
it
wow
i
really
love
this
beer
in
the
recent
weeks
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
some
pretty
amazing
beersduvel
lafindumonde
bink
tripel
and
the
corsendonk
brown
and
blond
to
name
a
few
i
must
say
that
the
chimay
is
still
my
favorite
i
poured
it
into
a
large
clear
glass
it
had
decent
lace
and
1
5
finger
head
i
could
detect
apples
and
bit
of
burnt
wood
flavor
after
about
3
quarters
of
the
way
through
my
head
got
warm
i
and
could
feel
the
alcohol
overall
i
love
the
whole
experience
and
taste
of
the
chimay
white
where
else
can
you
get
beer
brewed
by
monks
its
a
little
more
light
than
ive
seen
in
other
tripels
i
prefer
the
stronger
flavors
of
a
westmalle
but
this
would
be
more
ideal
in
the
right
weather
or
with
the
right
food
i
had
the
pleasure
of
pouring
this
beer
into
my
newly
acquired
chimay
goblet
it
was
sparkling
golden
with
a
thick
head

nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
sour
and
there
were
hints
of
fruitiness
the
taste
was
also
sour
and
fruity
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
makes
this
seem
like
a
more
delicate
beer
than
other
chimays
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
heavy
by
any
means
i
find
this
particular
beer
quite
drinkable
and
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
this
is
a
very
tasty
tripel
easily
enjoyable
in
moderation
as
the
abv
will
keep
you
line
very
niiicccee
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
cloudy
rich
golden
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
that
leaves
minor
lacing
there
is
also
some
tremendous
carbonation
working
here
the
smell
is
crisp
and
spicy
with
a
slight
note
of
clove
taste
is
very
balance
clove
sour
apple
and
little
bit
of
floral
character
as
well
mouthfeel
is
intense
due
to
the
carbonation
which
adds
to
the
crispness
being
that
i
drank
a
25
4
oz
bottle
myself
would
do
another
if
possible
is
a
testament
to
this
brews
drinkability
highly
recommended
i
ordered
this
on
tap
at
the
driskill
grill
in
austin
tx
which
happened
to
be
one
of
only
four
on
tap
in
a
perfect
world
it
would
be
great
to
have
superb
food
and
a
great
beer
list
the
tripel
was
very
enjoyable
but
it
i
was
not
able
to
pair
it
well
with
the
food
that
i
ordered
it
starts
bubbly
and
finishes
smooth
its
really
hitting
the
spot
right
now
its
one
of
my
new
favorites
very
hazy
dark
orange
in
color
no
real
head
to
speak
of
and
not
much
lacing
typical
belgian
smell
very
bitter
and
dry
mouthfeel
creamy
texture
with
a
medium
body
hops
are
not
noted
in
the
aroma
but
only
noted
on
the
aftertaste
spicey
orange
and
citrus
with
light
malts
mouthfeel
is
wellbalanced
from
all
angles
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
good
but
nothing
great
could
use
more
in
the
taste
and
appearance

comments
i
loved
this
delicious
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
the
abv
is
a
bit
pronounced
but
well
balanced
with
the
sweet
maltiness
dry
crisp
mouthfeel
drinkability
its
okay
nothing
to
write
home
about
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orangish
gold
color
with
white
creamy
head
that
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
smells
very
fruityestery
and
a
little
yeasty
tastes
very
hoppy
and
a
tiny
bit
sweet
and
yeasty
finishes
sort
of
sour
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
with
some
fizz
to
it
overall
its
fairly
drinkable
but
i
think
i
prefer
chimays
other
brews
drinkability
here
is
where
i
was
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
drink
the
beer
from
the
tap
it
might
have
just
been
me
but
the
alcohol
was
slightly
less
noticeable
than
usual
making
this
beer
a
pleasure
to
drink
in
large
mouthfilling
gulps
over
an
extended
period
of
time
i
find
myself
hardpressed
to
have
just
one
its
hard
to
describe
here
but
this
beer
is
all
of
a
piece
knows
what
it
wants
to
be
and
works
together
beautifully
might
be
ubiquitous
but
its
sure
good
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
balanced
fairly
well
really
enjoyable
a
slightly
underwhelming
tripel
solid
but
uninspiring
like
the
rest
of
chimays
range
not
bad
just
not
spectacular
chimay
tripel
pours
nicely
and
produces
a
beautiful
bright
white
head
which
sticks
around
through
out
the
whole
session
the
body
is
quite
hazy
and
caramel
in
color
it
gives
off
aromas
reminiscent
of
bubble
gum
it
also
has
a
taste
somewhat
like
bubble
gum
but
finishes
a
bit
like
orange
rind
this
bites
at
first
from
all
the
carbonation
and
finishes
warm
overall
great
tripel
from
a
great
trappist
brewery
but
not
the
best
trappist
tripel
ive
had
think
westmalle
d
very
drinkable
but
like
most
tripels
to
be
savoured
in
ones
or
twos
due
to
alcohol
kick
very
well
made
i
dont
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
given
the
price
and
given
the
taste
i
just
cant
hang
i
would
never
pass
one
up
if
bought
for
me
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
a
cool
crisp
tripel
very
nice
lacing
not
as
spicy
as
far
as
aroma
goes
lacks
the
pervasive
fruity
characteristics
hop
bitterness
makes
itself
known
right
away
the
mild
yeast
flavors
are
immediately
counteracted
by
the
strong
bitterness
somewhat
different
than
many
other
tripels
a
more
refreshing
and
drinkable
take
on
the
style
finished
clean
and
dry
with
a
slight
note
of
alcohol
and
hops
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
giant
white
fizzy
head
there
is
a
ton
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
so
be
careful
pouring
the
smell
is
a
strong
lemon
alcoholcandy
sugarand
a
bisquity
aroma
the
taste
is
full
of
carbonation
candy
sugaralcohol
lemonand
bread
yeast
a
good
flavored
beeryet
nothing
really
outstanding
the
mf
is
light
with
the
flavors
mixing
well
my
only
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
its
lighter
and
thinner
than
other
tripels
still
its
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
very
easy
to
drink
light
flavor
belies
8
excellent
tripel
though
not
as
complex
as
westmalle
or
karmeliet
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
will
pair
nicely
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
good
introduction
to
belgian
ales
and
tripels
probably
my
favorite
from
chimay
this
triple
can
be
considered
the
gold
standard
its
a
beer
everyone
should
try
recommended
surprisingly
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
tripel
that
can
creep
up
on
you
if
you
are
not
careful
its
actually
really
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
a
perfect
way
for
someone
to
get
into
belgian
beer
if
theyre
not
familiar
with
the
strikingly
bold
flavour
most
brews
present
dont
drink
and
review
probably
my
least
favorite
chimay
but
a
good
showing
none
the
less
i
would
like
to
try
aging
a
bottle
and
perhaps
review
it
again
great
as
usual
full
bodied
and
exceptionally
refreshing
and
drinkable
highly
recommended
pours
to
a
generous
white
head
and
belgian
lace
orangecloudy
color
aroma
is
spicy
and
peppery
with
a
little
malt
in
the
background
flavor
is
spicy
and
not
too
hot
for
8
abv
there
are
lots
of
fruity
esters
throughout
finishes
with
lingering
spice
and
malt
very
nice
brew
do
not
drink
it
ice
cold
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
first
to
get
the
full
effect
would
like
to
try
sidebyside
with
some
other
classics
westmalle
karmeliet
etc
the
tripel
is
crisp
and
light
on
the
tongue
with
alcohol
and
apple
notes
dominating
the
taste
even
moreso
as
it
warms
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
too
sharp
and
dry
for
my
liking
but
the
drinkability
is
good
it
definately
gets
more
complex
as
it
warms
and
has
enough
going
on
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
without
losing
interest
very
happy
to
say
im
having
this
from
my
own
tap
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
dense
white
head
that
soon
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
and
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
lemons
and
pears
with
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
background
tastes
sharp
at
first
then
mellows
into
nice
round
fruits
pear
and
bananas
finishes
with
a
crispness
and
reminds
me
of
a
dry
cider
mouthfeel
is
full
and
a
bit
chewy
at
the
end
its
color
belies
its
character
drinkability
is
excellent
i
fear
the
keg
wont
last
long
i
think
the
brothers
have
done
a
great
job
with
this
one
its
a
fantastic
crossover
beer
to
get
someone
who
has
had
a
few
hefes
and
whose
curiosity
is
peaked
into
the
belgians
just
nice
allaround
it
starts
pretty
and
the
rest
of
the
experience
is
damned
near
as
good
its
just
what
youd
expect
if
you
had
to
conjure
up
the
memory
of
a
classic
tripel
and
in
spite
of
the
very
warm
abv
its
very
and
dangerously
drinkable
either
that
or
everything
goes
down
like
silk
when
youre
at
monks
still
with
proper
caution
exercised
this
is
a
great
even
sessionable
beer
that
speaks
historical
volumes
drinkability
this
brew
has
all
the
characteristics
youve
come
to
expect
from
a
belgian
tripel
give
it
a
try
but
dont
expect
an
epiphany
cheers
was
able
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
last
evening
first
time
i
have
seen
it
on
tap
so
i
was
quite
excited
the
brew
had
a
slight
haze
to
it
and
the
color
of
golden
yellow
with
a
fair
sized
head
that
had
some
retention
leaving
some
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
nice
mix
of
spices
light
fruit
flavors
and
a
peppery
property
this
is
a
nice
aromatic
brew
the
taste
is
excellent
with
highlights
similar
to
what
was
noticed
in
the
nose
along
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
as
the
brew
warmed
i
noticed
different
properties
of
flavors
as
the
alcohol
come
out
more
along
with
what
i
think
is
a
more
pronounced
yeast
like
flavor
could
be
wrong
on
this
taste
though
over
all
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
one
that
i
really
should
have
more
often
drinkability
i
like
this
chimay
but
not
as
much
as
the
red
or
blue
poured
out
of
a
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
the
color
was
a
hazy
copper
nice
pillowy
white
head
with
some
real
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
wonderful
beligan
yeast
light
candy
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
some
apple
a
bit
of
hop
to
dry
the
aftertaste
very
nice
balance
this
ale
sits
very
well
on
the
tongue
nicely
carbonated
for
my
taste
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
look
for
in
a
beer
a
bit
sweet
a
bit
bitter
very
drinkable
though
this
will
put
you
on
your
ass
if
you
have
enough
of
them
nethertheless
and
great
beer
and
top
class
perhaps
though
a
little
lower
in
that
particular
class
for
me
this
is
the
quintessential
tripel
it
tastes
great
on
draft
or
in
the
bottle
and
ages
quite
well
while
it
isnt
the
best
tripel
that
ive
tried
it
is
certainly
the
most
consistent
and
serves
as
a
wonderful
benchmark
pours
a
golden
honey
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
is
long
lasting
with
plenty
of
lacing
smell
was
a
mix
of
fruitiness
and
spiciness
mostly
peaches
apricots
and
cinnamon
and
cloves
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
with
most
of
the
fruitiness
upfront
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
could
have
this
one
all
night
a
very
good
beer
and
this
was
a
very
fresh
brew
thanks
to
my
great
son
studying
overseas
in
amsterdam
i
was
sent
this
for
the
unique
chance
to
enjoy
direct
from
the
brewer
750
ml
bottle
color
of
clear
golden

nice
beer
but
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
anytime
soon
at
the
price
point
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
beers
texture
and
form
in
the
mouth
is
flat
out
fantastic
it
elevates
the
flavors
and
distributes
the
nuances
across
the
tongue
remarkably
well
after
swirling
in
all
yeast
sediment
for
the
last
minutes
of
this
tasting
the
mouthfeel
became
even
creamier
and
fullerbodied
aromas
of
lemon
peel
came
forth
and
a
more
prominent
general
breadiness
manifested
glad
to
have
tried
this
but
when
i
crave
a
tripel
there
are
several
that
would
come
to
mind
before
this
2005
33cl
bottle
excellent
tripel
aroma
of
pepper
tabacco
phenol
clove
and
orange
the
aroma
draws
almost
directly
into
the
flavor
with
more
prenouced
phenol
clove
and
pepper
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
and
tobacco
followed
by
a
mellow
bitterness
the
sprite
carbonation
plays
great
with
the
aroma
flavor
and
dryness
of
the
beer
an
well
crafted
beer
this
was
an
11
2
oz
bottle
sampled
in
a
kappitel
goblet
this
was
a
supremely
smooth
flavorful
and
drinkable
beer
the
head
retention
was
outstanding
and
the
color
and
nose
were
both
medium
bodied
and
very
pleasing
the
taste
was
a
mildly
yeasty
very
malted
graininess
with
a
slight
alcohol
finish
that
was
transitioned
into
seamlessly
overall
this
was
a
tremendous
beer
that
i
will
definitely
explore
again
and
again
i
will
next
sample
and
review
the
red
blue
and
even
though
the
styles
are
different
im
looking
forward
to
both
recommended
very
highly
overall
a
good
beer
but
the
ten
bucks
for
a
large
bottle
makes
it
a
rare
purchase
for
me
however
i
would
say
its
required
drinking
for
any
beer
lover
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
but
unfortunately
one
that
i
over
look
often
the
brother
at
scourmont
do
a
fantastic
job
at
making
beer
or
at
least
the
people
in
the
other
brewery
that
isnt
in
the
walls
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
beer
overall
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
finally
review
this
one
but
if
you
buy
this
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
a
small
bottle
i
have
had
terrible
luck
with
the
larger
750
mls
that
are
corked
and
caged
it
seems
like
almost
half
of
them
have
cork
taint
this
small
bottle
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
chimay
white
ive
ever
had
normally
i
love
the
large
bottles
for
other
beers
but
the
chimay
beers
seem
to
have
cork
issues
at
least
in
my
area
served
in
a
chimay
glass
this
beer
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
color
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
nose
is
average
for
the
style
the
flavor
was
good
but
not
over
whelmingly
impressive
a
little
spicy
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
tripels
i
enjoy
perhaps
even
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
certainly
not
what
i
was
expecting
to
taste
still
this
is
a
respectable
tripel
if
not
the
best
in
class
the
taste
started
sharply
alcoholic
but
quickly
broadened
into
a
smooth
malty
flavour

muted
though
and
nondescript
the
alcohol
provided
a
nice
warmth
as
it
went
down
lively
carbonation
and
medium
body
round
out
this
competent
tripel
its
good
but
there
are
better
tripels
and
chimays
other
styles
are
better
up
front
there
was
a
lot
of
thick
sweet
malt
which
was
balanced
off
with
the
fruitherbs
and
spice
tones
leaving
an
impression
of
frozen
cinnamon
bun
dough
with
tangerine
slices
mid
palate
these
flavors
evolve
into
a
more
complex
taste
senasation
which
is
more
spice
pronounced
then
the
long
finish
where
gradual
drying
takes
place
and
the
phenominal
hop
mixture
shows
up
to
complicate
the
end
of
this
drink
by
peppering
it
with
metallicfruitymedicinalherbal
tastes
which
fight
against
the
near
cloying
malts
and
sugars
everything
in
balance
on
this
drink
very
pleasurable
to
sip
on
particualrly
on
this
damp
chilly
evening
thanks
rob
wonderful
birthday
gift
thanks
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
dwindles
and
leaves
a
coat
of
foam
hops
are
noted
moreso
than
with
other
tripels
ive
tried
the
alcohol
shows
through
as
well
nice
carbonation
and
a
surprise
but
i
much
prefer
the
grande
reserve
blue
cloudy
apricot
colour
it
pours
a
big
head
with
big
bubbles
that
lingers
for
a
while
complex
arome
of
spices
coriander
clove
pepper
and
fruits
with
some
hint
of
banana
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
spicy
fruity
oranges
a
hint
of
figs
some
honey
flowery
dry
and
bitter
finish
cheers
drinkable
for
a
strong
beer
but
one
is
better
off
savoring
this
over
an
extended
period
the
mouthfeel
is
full
of
tiny
creamy
bubbles
and
the
drinkability
is
really
nice
d
to
be
sipped
on
and
enjoyed
at
a
very
slow
pace
sit
and
enjoy
every
drop
den
skoal
each
and
every
sip
was
a
bit
different
sometimes
youd
get
a
good
batch
of
candy
sugar
and
ripe
fruits
others
would
be
spicy
all
were
finished
very
boozy
came
off
more
sweet
then
i
remembered
the
other
variations
being
regardless
the
carbonation
kept
it
from
becoming
either
syrupy
or
overly
chewy
besides
how
one
might
get
distracted
from
the
mouthfeel
with
the
etoh
burn
the
big
bottle
just
sort
of
disappeared
somehow
750
ml
corked
and
boailed
bottle
the
cork
had
a
date
of
0405
on
it
dunno
why
i
had
never
reviewed
this
before
33
cl
bottle
reads
lao023
glorious
looking
beer
with
a
tower
of
white
foam
golden
hazyness
and
lively
carbonation
a
hoppy
bite
to
it
quite
enjoyable
with
the
spicy
bubbles
bready
body
like
a
fresh
baked
french
baquette
belgian
yeast
profile
no
mistake
about
it
just
the
slightest
amount
of
sweetness
bitter
and
peppery
very
similar
to
duval
but
with
a
much
rounder
malt
flavor
more
and
more
accessible
these
days
so
a
great
choice
at
the
store
or
the
bar
by
far
my
favorite
chimay
variety
but
ill
have
to
pay
the
red
and
blue
labels
another
visit
soon
cheers
the
aroma
is
pretty
pungeant
i
detect
some
grassiness
and
earthiness
there
is
some
fruitiness
thrown
in
too
from
bananas
and
apricots
the
taste
is
definitely
unique
with
some
light
alcohol
and
lite
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
tangy
and
full
bodied
drinkability
is
dangerously
good
you
would
never
know
this
one
packs
8
the
taste
lingers
and
gets
better
throughout
the
beer
leaving
you
wanting
more
this
beer
doesnt
top
westmalle
for
me
but
it
comes
close
im
not
sure
which
i
prefer
the
first
milder
cleaner
glass
or
the
second
yeasty
peppery
and
bitter
glass
both
are
great
and
i
hope
to
god
that
this
review
makes
sense
i
enjoy
it
ontap
too
but
the
bomber
is
the
gift
that
keeps
on
giving
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
much
better
than
i
remember
not
a
typical
tripel
but
very
nice
looking
forward
to
having
this
again
d
this
was
very
drinkable
but
im
sure
it
would
taste
better
if
it
had
some
time
to
age
ill
have
to
try
it
as
soon
as
i
establish
a
place
to
age
the
taste
starts
with
big
citric
wash
of
fruit
and
candy
mixed
with
an
herbal
bitterness
and
nice
round
malt
it
turns
dry
and
finishes
long
mouthfeel
is
creamy
active
and
smooth
delicious
and
slightly
different
than
the
larger
bottle
the
dryness
doesnt
clamp
down
on
the
sweet
fruit
as
quickly
and
the
finish
is
not
as
dusty
whether
this
is
due
to
the
characteristics
of
fermenting
in
different
size
bottles
or
if
its
because
of
slight
variations
in
the
brewing
of
the
batches
who
knows
maybe
im
hallucinating
anyway
i
like
em
both
drinkability
a
session
beer
easy
to
drink
a
real
treat
wish
i
was
rich
so
that
i
could
drink
this
more
often
i
will
certainly
purchase
this
again
very
nice
beer
a
true
treat
for
all
the
senses
pair
this
with
a
nice
appetizer
of
braised
pork
tenderloin
slices
definite
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
that
everyone
should
try
highly
recommended
what
a
wonderful
beer
mmmm
bottom
line
this
bottle
of
chimay
cinq
cents
is
inspiring
im
going
to
buy
some
more
and
sock
away
a
few
bottles
for
later
enjoyment
no
mishandling
of
them
guaranteed
highly
recommended
pours
a
golden
cidery
amber
nice
head
pure
white
good
retention
leaving
minor
lacing
sents
of
apple
some
minor
hops
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
nice
mild
citrus
and
apple
a
tiny
hint
of
candy
little
bitterness
from
hops
i
must
admit
i
was
bios
for
along
time
because
chimay
way
my
first
experience
with
a
tripel
but
since
i
have
found
several
i
enjoy
a
little
more
any
how
this
is
still
nice
but
id
rather
drink
others
overall
simply
stated
excellent
its
an
excellent
beer
for
anyone
who
has
never
tried
a
belgian
tripel
before
and
is
looking
to
make
the
leap
give
it
a
try
you
wont
be
disappointed
i
could
drink
this
all
night
until
the
alcohol
caught
up
to
me
the
peres
trappistes
got
it
going
on
in
the
brew
game
overall
this
beer
was
good
however
i
doubt
i
will
buy
it
again
unless
i
get
it
for
a
good
deal
i
simply
have
access
to
too
many
better
beers
drinkability
this
is
decent
but
not
great
id
have
one
or
two
of
these
11
2
oz
servings
that
is
or
just
one
750
ml
bottle
every
onceinawhile
perhaps
not
the
finest
belgian
tripel
in
the
world
jurys
still
out
on
that
one
but
certainly
a
quintessential
example
of
how
a
great
belgian
tripel
can
be
liquid
nirvana
still
another
well
made
beer
from
chimay
d
really
just
an
excellent
beer
definitely
worth
the
price
i
paid
for
it
and
the
time
it
took
to
make
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
a
sophisticated
beer
that
really
quenches
the
thirst
served
into
chimay
goblet
with
a
beautiful
goldenamber
pour
with
a
nice
head
that
really
hugs
the
glass
a
perfect
pairing
of
fruity
sweetness
balanced
with
hops
with
a
great
balance
of
bitter
a
very
effervescent
mouthfeel
and
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
i
couldnt
be
more
happy
that
this
is
now
ontap
in
my
area
sweet
caramalized
liquid
sugar
sweetness
hits
the
palate
with
a
sharp
dryness
on
the
finish
lifesavers
orange
candy
peach
puree
and
sweet
grains
blend
together
nice
hop
presence
a
solid
belgian
tripel
drinkability
good
drinkability
a
solid
tasty
trippel
doesnt
have
the
constrasting
flavors
or
the
fuller
mouthfeel
of
westmalle
or
karmeliet
but
solid
nonetheless
overall
and
excellent
brew
id
have
it
again
as
long
as
im
not
paying
11
25
for
an
8
ounce
pour
drinkability
doubtful
i
would
get
again
i
kinda
am
finding
this
to
be
a
mediocre
representation
of
what
i
like
in
tripels
drinkabilityoverall
light
and
wellbalanced
does
well
as
a
bspa
or
a
tripel
though
more
authentic
as
the
former
one
of
the
more
drinkable
of
the
9
we
sampled
bottle
pours
a
light
brown
which
is
non
translucent
smells
of
fruit
most
oustanding
is
grape
taste
is
sweet
with
grape
and
apples
mouthfeels
is
light
and
quite
dry
with
a
quick
finish
a
very
good
beer
which
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
off
a
bargain
at
about
4
for
a
small
bottle
o
k
after
trying
cinq
cents
premiere
and
reserve
i
have
decided
that
i
am
officially
prejudiced
in
the
favor
of
these
monks
i
think
everyone
should
have
a
favorite
abbey
this
offering
has
a
peachy
coloring
and
slightly
hazy
look
to
it
i
smell
citrus
and
heavy
spice
heavily
carbonated
with
a
head
and
lacing
that
will
not
quit
mouthfeel
somewhat
light
for
such
a
big
beer
way
too
drinkable
for
such
a
high
alcohol
content
very
dangerous
i
enjoyed
the
chimay
triple
but
i
realised
it
was
probably
too
strong
for
many
who
might
be
looking
for
a
malty
cream
taste
drinkability
is
not
as
good
as
the
chimay
red
still
a
great
beer
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
tripel
the
appearance
and
smell
are
very
nice
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
others
additionally
the
strong
alcohol
in
the
taste
is
troublesome
that
said
ill
certainly
give
this
another
try
overall
a
tremendous
and
eminently
drinkable
beer
wow
purchased
this
bottled
at
a
gourmet
food
chain
in
town
appearancewise
rather
cloudy
and
a
pleasant
shade
of
tan
and
goldenyellow
poured
a
large
lasting
creamy
head
that
was
almost
three
fingers
wide
and
left
a
nice
lace
in
its
wake
nicely
carbonated
definitely
not
too
gassy
with
a
spicy
aroma
tastewise
pleasantly
heavy
on
the
malt
with
a
sweet
and
buttery
flavour
that
nicely
masked
the
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
whole
a
pretty
fullbodied
and
complex
beer
with
nice
hop
notes
very
drinkable
my
first
tripel
and
definitely
not
my
last
imo
of
the
three
colors
of
chimay
this
is
just
ahead
of
the
red
and
just
behind
the
blue
but
all
three
are
delightfully
exquisite
overall
good
all
around
recommended
quite
drinkable
almost
sessionable
except
for
the
alcohol
go
get
some
now
i
love
a
tripel
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
served
in
a
chalice
at
the
old
monk
in
texas
appearance
was
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
moderate
head
which
subsided
into
lacing
over
time
the
aroma
consisted
of
yeast
malt
but
the
hops
really
came
through
for
a
belgian
some
spicy
notes
were
also
present
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
at
first
with
a
good
hop
balance
which
was
present
more
in
the
finish
i
also
picked
up
some
clovepepper
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
body
that
seemed
lighter
than
the
bottled
version
which
i
would
call
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
more
carbonated
warmth
from
the
alcohol
was
present
but
fairly
well
hidden
drinkability
was
high
and
i
would
consider
this
beer
a
troublemaker
in
that
you
are
unlikely
to
realize
the
abv
from
the
taste
a
classic
d
drinkable
a
very
nice
brew
from
chimay
would
recommend
well
ive
maybe
only
had
around
50
total
beers
but
this
one
i
could
just
not
get
a
handle
on
as
i
was
drinking
this
i
could
not
come
up
with
a
way
to
describe
the
taste
or
smell
yes
my
palate
is
inexperienced
but
this
was
also
my
first
trippel
it
was
definitely
sweet
but
i
had
a
hard
time
picking
out
individual
flavors
the
appearance
is
a
fairly
clear
gold
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
whether
you
try
to
pour
for
the
head
or
not
its
still
going
to
be
huge
the
taste
as
i
can
describe
it
is
only
sweet
but
you
could
tell
there
is
the
faintest
of
hops
at
the
very
back
end
which
may
be
saaz
but
really
im
not
sure
this
bottle
was
loaded
with
yeast
and
since
i
had
to
pour
about
half
the
bottle
and
then
wait
to
pour
the
rest
the
yeast
was
stirred
up
and
towards
the
end
what
i
had
was
a
very
cloudy
beer
with
tons
of
yeast
in
suspension
that
definitely
seemed
to
change
the
flavor
to
give
it
more
of
a
twang
but
it
was
still
good
this
was
still
very
enjoyable
especially
at
8
alcohol
you
definitely
arent
going
to
be
complaining
d
really
easy
to
drink
almost
tooo
easy
shifty
eyes
i
look
forward
to
buying
another
bottle
as
soon
as
the
store
opens
cheers
beautiful
hazy
goldorange
color
with
halfinch
head
and
good
retention
the
aroma
is
spicy
citruslike
and
right
on
for
the
style
taste
is
also
lemony
and
spicy
with
a
mild
phenolic
and
peppery
bite
lightly
tart
but
overall
a
good
range
and
balance
of
flavors
alcohol
is
not
too
noticible
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
with
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
perfect
carbonation
i
love
belgian
tripels
and
this
one
it
a
classic
example
with
enough
complexity
that
you
cant
pass
it
up
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
pours
with
good
head
that
reduces
slightly
faster
than
some
other
tripels
that
laces
nicely
sweet
slightly
darker
than
golden
color
classic
tripel
taste
and
smell
slightly
citric
hints
of
spices
and
some
other
fruits
has
that
nice
kind
of
sticky
mouthfeel
that
stays
around
for
a
while
a
beer
that
i
will
continously
buy
despite
my
low
wage
over
and
over
this
beer
was
not
bad
and
im
glad
to
see
it
on
tap
but
its
my
least
favorite
tripel
thus
far
ive
only
had
a
few
as
well
as
my
least
favorite
chimay
fairly
delicious
with
the
bitter
quality
eric
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
thats
backed
by
a
huge
presence
of
microbubble
carbonation
heres
a
belgian
ale
thats
closest
to
the
style
i
like
so
i
imagine
if
youre
a
hop
head
this
will
be
a
closest
belgian
to
your
preferences
plenty
of
body
with
a
somewhat
velvety
mouthfeel
and
ample
alcohol
make
this
beer
a
pleasant
sipper
another
quality
belgian
that
knows
this
style
all
too
well
tastes
great
ontap
but
it
puts
a
dent
in
your
wallet
cheers
no
sir
this
chimay
tripel
didnt
do
anything
for
me
at
all
it
does
all
mellow
out
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
it
all
still
doesnt
come
together
very
cohesively
drinkability
this
is
very
drinkable
and
would
be
excellent
with
a
meal
finishes
so
clean
and
its
smooth
its
warming
and
well
balanced
but
very
flavorful
and
palate
cleansing
drinkability

i
dont
know
what
it
wasbut
something
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
here
i
found
this
one
a
little
tougher
to
finish
than
most
tripels
all
in
all
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
pick
for
a
tripel
it
smells
fantastic
but
just
doesnt
live
up
to
it
in
the
taste
department
not
bad
overall
but
not
one
of
the
greats
this
tripel
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
clinging
and
leaving
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
typical
tripel
aroma
of
belgian
malt
with
touch
of
vinousness
the
taste
was
fruity
with
light
belgian
maltiness
and
a
very
light
sweetness
there
was
also
some
vinous
malt
flavors
and
a
kiss
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
dry
overall
with
only
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
body
was
medium
with
good
carbonation
the
finish
was
lightly
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
this
was
a
very
nice
enjoyable
tripel
overall
a
decent
tripel
however
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
that
represent
the
style
not
bad
not
as
good
as
i
remember
this
being
though
maybe
age
it
longer
or
was
it
bc
i
loved
it
on
draft
so
much
same
330ml
bottle
as
the
blue
and
red
white
label
with
tripel
on
it
tasted
at
cellar
temperature
in
my
chalice
glass
aggressive
carbonation
right
from
the
cappopping
this
poured
loudly
into
the
glass
forming
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
receded
fairly
quickly
the
beers
colour
is
amazing
deep
nectarinejuice
and
light
orange
with
the
softest
hue
of
caramelbrown
the
head
is
consistent
at
a
thin
layer
though
the
tightness
seems
a
little
lacking
good
sheets
of
bubbly
lacing
aroma
of
white
sugar
and
plenty
of
phenols
actually
the
beer
smells
very
much
like
the
yeaststrain
of
unibroues
beers
sourish
malts
green
apple
and
candy
sugar
dusty
malts
with
lots
of
yeasty
notes
some
woody
resinous
and
almost
faintly
smoky
smells
in
there
as
well
the
aroma
is
very
sugary
but
also
very
salty
a
delightful
smell
just
not
as
complex
as
i
imagined
it
would
be
and
its
a
little
too
high
on
the
sugar
notes
the
initial
smell
when
the
head
is
full
is
very
good
though
kind
of
like
the
warming
nearly
alcoholic
smell
of
fresh
rising
bread
or
even
fermenting
grapes
the
taste
is
quite
extraordinarily
bitter
from
beginning
to
end
seriously
the
hopping
is
quite
predominant
at
least
in
mouthfeel
and
it
leaves
a
dry
but
sugarysalty
aftertaste
one
of
the
bitterest
tripels
i
have
had
excellent
fresh
hopping
the
malts
are
supportive
but
add
only
little
flavouring
again
the
saccharine
sweetness
feels
just
too
assertive
for
this
tripel
it
becomes
a
little
cloying
and
its
all
i
can
seem
to
feel
in
the
mouth
after
a
while
some
fruity
notes
come
though
such
as
pear
and
green
grapes
again
this
is
tasty
but
hardly
outstanding
as
far
as
belgian
tripels
go
fairly
high
carbonation
and
a
full
body
drinkable
but
the
sugar
in
this
beer
really
does
distract
from
its
character
thank
goodness
we
have
the
blue
and
red
for
a
tripel
this
was
just
a
tad
disappointing
from
such
a
great
trappist
brewery
even
if
they
are
the
biggest
and
most
commercial
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
this
beer
seems
to
do
everything
pretty
decently
but
im
still
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
price
once
the
beer
has
warmed
i
would
put
the
flavour
up
to
4
but
it
starts
out
only
3
so
i
have
to
average
the
two
scores
solid
stuff
in
any
case
pours
a
cloudy
goldtinted
orange
head
fills
the
glass
then
slowly
forms
a
large
rocky
head
and
leaves
a
stubborn
patchwork
of
lace
pilsener
malt
and
fusels
in
the
nose
but
mostly
medicinal
phenols
and
powdery
yeast
the
taste
is
sweet
with
pilsener
malt
and
wheat
belgian
phenols
like
bananas
and
medicine
and
a
yeasty
background
dry
aftertaste
spicy
cloves
and
candi
sugar
alcohol
burn
and
faint
goldings
hop
notes
mediumfull
body
and
medium
carbonation
a
smooth
dry
and
tart
mouthfeel
and
flambouyant
example
of
the
style
the
high
sweetness
is
balanced
by
the
alcoholic
bite
and
solid
hop
bitterness
that
presents
itself
in
the
finish
to
combat
residual
sweetness
a
flambouyant
example
of
the
style
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
am
a
big
fan
of
whitbeir
and
this
is
a
superb
example
i
purchased
this
750ml
bottle
for
around
8
at
a
large
wine
and
beer
store
it
came
highly
recomended
from
the
assistant
manager
and
i
must
say
that
i
agree
in
its
quality
the
bottle
appearance
is
classy
with
its
champaigne
style
cork
closure
and
the
trappist
seal
to
ensure
its
quality
the
beer
smells
of
cofee
and
muted
bananas
with
a
sweet
spice
similar
to
cloves
phenols
are
evident
but
not
overpowering
the
strain
of
yeast
isolated
by
father
theodore
is
definately
at
the
heart
of
this
beer
and
provides
at
taste
and
aroma
that
set
the
standard
for
this
category
of
beer
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
coffee
muted
banana
chocolate
clove
and
alcohol
flavors
the
alcohol
is
muted
and
only
manifests
itself
if
the
brew
is
allowed
to
rest
too
long
on
the
palate
lingering
bitter
on
the
edges
of
the
tounge
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
but
not
syrupy
medium
heavy
carbonation
and
lingering
lacing
creamy
tan
durable
head
stays
with
you
till
the
end
of
the
glass
not
extremely
drinkable
i
finished
the
whole
bottle
but
i
wont
want
another
one
for
a
while
overall
a
very
highly
recomended
beer
having
one
just
makes
me
want
another
ok
yes
i
did
have
a
few
this
is
a
great
brew
overall
a
decent
triple
other
than
the
price
i
would
say
this
is
quite
drinkable
served
in
a
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
orangegolden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
taste
is
slightly
bitter
slightly
sweet
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
this
beer
has
a
decent
drinkability
i
can
drink
the
750
but
wouldnt
drink
two
at
a
time
the
alcohol
says
that
it
is
8
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
is
bought
for
10
a
bottle
i
would
not
buy
this
all
the
time
but
it
definitely
worth
a
drink
once
in
a
while
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
a
little
boring
and
underwhelming
from
a
mix
pack
of
the
three
most
common
chimays
orangy
and
clear
big
white
head
malty
biscuity
odor
very
pungent
smooth
taste
that
becomes
harsh
on
the
back
end
malty
and
spicy
and
some
alcohol
up
front
nothing
special
for
the
style
maybe
i
just
like
my
tripels
to
be
bigger
and
meaner
this
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
some
sediment
excellent
lacing
great
retenion
of
a
large
white
head
a
fair
ammount
of
carbonation
definitely
some
phenols
to
start
banana
candy
sugar
yeast
mild
citrus
malt
alcohol
lots
more
i
cant
wrap
my
finger
around
this
carries
over
to
the
taste
along
with
some
mild
spice
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
acidic
but
blended
out
into
a
smooth
and
satisfying
mildness
the
carbonation
didnt
get
in
the
way
as
i
had
remembered
when
i
had
this
the
first
time
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
great
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
certainly
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
this
is
becoming
a
style
that
many
folks
are
messing
around
with
but
chimay
obviously
knows
what
theyre
doing
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
id
certainly
go
back
to
this
appeared
a
somewhat
hazy
godlen
color
with
a
small
white
head
retention
was
excellent
with
tiny
air
bubbles
on
the
rise
overall
quite
nice
smell
was
of
light
fruits
such
as
pears
apples
figs
passionfruit
also
a
bit
of
a
musty
smell
going
on
as
well
taste
was
fruity
with
hints
of
honey
banana
and
clove
leading
into
a
rather
spicy
peppery
profile
leaving
a
balance
of
sweetness
and
spice
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
good
dosage
of
hoppy
goodness
this
beer
was
very
well
executed
the
balance
was
damn
close
to
perfect
i
could
drink
up
many
in
one
sitting
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
full
of
complex
flavors
i
would
let
it
warm
a
bit
to
let
some
of
the
fainter
tastes
pull
through
mouth
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
it
smells
with
a
lasting
bitter
taste
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
after
swallowing
the
sweetness
lasts
well
on
the
tongue
as
well
so
youre
left
with
a
very
balanced
after
taste
its
creamy
and
spicy
upon
exhaling
this
brew
tastes
a
bit
like
an
accessible
semisec
orval
its
probably
best
paired
with
some
stew
or
soft
cheese
fairly
enjoyable
for
the
style
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
to
be
sure
taste
very
malty
with
bread
dough
and
somei
caramel
theres
a
little
orangey
citrus
and
honey
and
a
slightl
yeasty
funkiness
the
coriander
and
peppery
spices
come
out
as
this
gets
closer
to
room
temp
along
with
some
more
fruitiness
such
as
pears
and
pineapples
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
touch
on
the
creamy
side
drinkability
is
nice
but
takes
a
hit
due
to
a
the
sweetness
being
a
bit
to
high
for
my
tastes
without
any
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
my
chimay
cinq
cents
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
was
a
hazy
deep
orangeaburn
with
a
2
inch
rocky
offwhite
head
heaps
of
lace
left
on
the
majestic
chalice
some
sweet
and
clean
smells
like
apple
and
pair
slight
phenols
bit
of
malt
and
slight
yeast
twang
the
apple
qualities
continue
in
the
flavor
more
tart
though
musky
yeast
tinge
of
hidden
alchohol
and
fairly
foward
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
creamed
up
by
the
carbonation
but
remains
crisp
a
pleasant
trappist
tripel
though
i
do
find
some
of
the
others
more
intersting
had
this
on
tap
at
taco
mac
little
to
no
head
and
no
lacing
appearance
was
very
cloudy
might
be
because
it
was
served
waaay
too
cold
very
strong
aroma
of
yeast
and
fruit
couldnt
really
smell
pure
hops
but
plenty
of
fruit
nice
long
finish
but
could
taste
more
of
the
alcohol
than
i
wouldve
liked
not
a
great
representative
of
the
tripel
style
still
good
md
soft
mouthfeel
on
top
of
the
dryish
flavour
the
contrast
is
just
great
while
the
gentle
and
constant
fizziness
provides
a
healthy
body
for
the
palate
to
absorb
the
full
flavour
all
in
all
a
dry
and
bitter
tripel
not
my
favourite
but
a
nice
one
all
the
same
the
first
distinctive
element
is
a
formidable
head
that
looks
as
thick
and
rich
as
mousse
i
understand
that
this
is
a
common
characteristic
of
tripels
below
this
mighty
crown
is
a
cloudy
orange
color
and
multiple
trails
of
bubbles
streaming
to
the
surface
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
complex
and
dominated
with
a
caramel
scent
the
first
sip
is
alive
with
a
texture
of
flavors
including
malty
sweetness
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
balancing
bitter
tastes
at
the
sides
and
back
of
the
mouth
along
with
these
dominant
sensations
are
hints
of
spices
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
creamy
for
a
beer
that
seems
so
light
the
more
sips
i
take
the
more
flavors
seem
to
come
out
and
the
delicate
dance
between
bitterness
and
sweetness
is
decidedly
enjoyable
finishing
in
a
very
pleasant
and
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
carbonation
is
fairly
high
but
not
overpowering
and
warming
brings
out
more
subtle
flavors
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
one
wants
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
over
a
long
period
of
time
which
is
a
good
thing
as
it
is
also
deceptively
strong
with
each
taste
very
refreshing
and
enjoyablea
classic
trippel
overall
a
good
tripel
with
a
taste
i
would
expect
from
the
style
but
with
more
dry
finish
than
most
domestic
representations
a
good
experience
but
i
like
the
taste
of
the
cheaper
domestic
versions
of
the
style
just
as
much
if
not
more
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
and
ontap
this
more
enjoyable
than
the
bottled
version
d
this
beer
isnt
great
i
can
think
of
several
tripels
i
would
sooner
have
chimay
red
and
blue
are
delectable
but
this
is
one
to
pass
up
i
couldnt
session
it
but
the
bitterness
might
help
wash
down
some
foods
this
was
by
far
the
worst
of
the
big
three
chimays
for
me
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
will
sample
again
in
the
near
future
and
adjust
my
scores
accordingly
drinkability

well
this
ale
was
served
way
too
cold
but
once
it
warmed
up
it
did
just
right
by
me
it
went
down
smoothly
if
a
tad
overcarbonated
and
had
a
nice
yeasty
backbone
which
i
enjoy
in
the
style
adam
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
it
is
beautiful
it
is
as
if
all
these
big
bubbles
push
down
on
your
tounge
at
once
and
then
jump
off
it
in
unison
never
to
be
seen
again
then
the
liquid
even
lightens
on
the
tounge
and
i
begin
to
question
if
there
is
even
beer
in
my
mouth
at
all
anymore
very
cool
this
single
quality
along
with
the
floral
aroma
make
this
beer
a
real
etherial
experience
ive
never
been
a
chimay
fan
really
but
i
never
met
this
lovely
lady
they

pungency
to
mellow
out
the
sweetness
a
little
peppery
also
carbonation
is
alive
and
filling
giving
this
a
medium
body
finishes
dry
with
a
pleasant
and
refreshing
aftertaste
even
though
i
favor
the
grand
reserve
blue
over
this
great
beer
on
tap
at
monks
cafe
the
beer
poured
a
golden
copper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
active
carbonation
there
is
a
nice
malty
yeast
aroma
to
this
beer
with
some
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
some
citrus
bite
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
that
is
refreshing
easy
to
recommend
this
one
it
is
a
darker
color
of
copper
with
a
wonderfully
rich
creamy
head
leaving
an
excellant
ring
and
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
yeasty
aromas
come
through
as
well
as
biscuits
bread
clove
nutmeg
and
banana
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
the
alcohol
hidden
very
well
and
just
a
bit
of
hop
presence
in
the
finish
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
that
tingles
nicely
on
the
tongue
very
nice
to
drink
always
a
solid
choice
only
downside
is
that
i
paid
6
50
for
a
11
2
ounce
bottle
at
a
conference
center
but
it
sure
beats
my
other
choices
miller
lite
corona
becks
in
terms
of
drinkability
it
is
very
filling
so
its
difficult
to
warrant
drinking
several
of
them
but
the
overall
experience
is
good
enough
for
it
to
be
in
the
better
than
average
category
a
nice
beer
not
world
class
but
very
enjoyable
a
decent
brew
it
is
a
little
high
priced
but
worth
a
try
the
alcohol
wasnt
hidden
well
and
i
didnt
like
the
aftertaste
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
compare
well
to
the
westmalle
tripel
i
had
several
days
ago
but
this
fell
well
short
in
comparison
to
the
red
and
blue
the
white
falls
a
bit
short
while
still
a
quality
beer
the
alcohols
get
a
little
out
of
balance
the
look
is
still
a
nearly
perfect
sight
the
aromas
pick
up
on
a
tart
spicy
alcohol
that
begins
to
dominate
the
delicate
malt
flavors
the
fuitcake
flavors
and
malts
take
a
back
seat
to
a
rumlike
flavor
a
bitter
flavor
and
feel
hits
the
back
of
the
throat
and
becomes
a
little
husky
the
muskiness
and
boldness
of
the
beer
still
contributes
to
complexity
and
variety
i
just
prefer
the
red
and
blue
this
beer
popped
open
and
almost
took
my
eye
out
before
i
even
got
the
metal
thing
twisted
complety
off
this
is
the
best
looking
bier
i
have
seen
in
a
while
and
leaves
a
pillowy
white
head
on
top
with
a
lacing
that
just
wont
quit
smells
fruity
hoppy
and
clovey
it
has
a
fairly
suddle
scent
to
it
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
hops
it
tastes
fruity
as
well
but
dominated
by
hops
i
can
see
where
it
would
taste
awsome
if
i
could
get
more
fruity
smell
and
taste
to
it
i
wonder
why
it
was
so
dominated
by
hops
the
belgian
monks
who
brew
this
are
quite
clever
down
enough
chimay
and
suddenly
that
whole
celibacy
vow
thing
doesnt
seem
half
bad
pours
a
hazy
apple
cider
amberorange
into
my
chimay
chalice
huge
white
rocky
head
forms
settles
down
after
a
few
minutes
with
tons
of
lace
smell
is
very
citrusy
lots
of
yeast
iron
honey
bread
taste
is
sweet
citrus
bitterness
orange
peel
spice
yeast
iron
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
little
bit
cloying
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
purchased
after
nc
lifted
the
abv
cap
to
15
im
just
now
getting
to
review
it
because
ive
been
spending
all
my
money
on
the
hundreds
of
new
beers
that
have
appeared
since
then
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangegold
color
that
is
very
appealing
to
the
eye
the
aromas
wafting
from
my
duvel
chalice
are
of
sweet
malts
and
citrusyresiny
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
at
first
but
then
i
can
detect
a
little
bit
of
sourness
also
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
taste
but
otherwise
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
sweet
belgian
character
is
present
throughout
this
was
a
750ml
bottle
that
i
bought
for
5
99
not
a
bad
deal
in
my
opinion
like
the
aroma
the
first
thing
detectable
in
the
flavor
is
a
sly
sweetness
a
smooth
malty
character
is
evident
and
also
a
smokey
element
something
like
fruit
wood
smoke
as
im
drinking
this
i
just
cant
get
over
the
wisp
of
smokey
flavor
you
get
after
you
swallow
a
sip
its
not
strong
and
inyourface
but
once
you
notice
its
there
it
cant
be
denied
a
crisp
clean
opening
with
a
very
earthy
finish
of
all
the
chimay
beers
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
the
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
great
white
head
that
lasted
till
the
last
sip
the
smell
was
quite
skunky
to
begin
with
but
it
melowed
out
within
a
few
minutes
the
flavor
was
nice
and
crisp
but
lacked
the
depth
that
i
expected
from
the
brew
the
tart
hops
were
in
effect
and
once
i
poured
the
yeast
into
the
mix
it
helped
things
out
a
but
but
oveall
a
bland
yet
drinkable
beer
worth
the
price
no
go
with
the
grand
reserve
if
you
are
going
to
go
chimay
but
if
you
like
slightly
skunky
brews
witht
decent
characther
then
give
it
a
try
although
i
like
this
beer
i
think
that
i
like
the
blue
and
red
better
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
some
mighty
fine
brew
i
straightforwardly
favor
the
other
two
over
this
one
the
beer
pours
almost
a
cider
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
that
holds
fantastically
and
laces
well
the
smell
is
not
all
that
strong
but
there
are
some
sweet
scents
coming
through
theses
sweets
smells
could
possibly
be
cherries
and
grapefruit
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
formidable
again
it
is
very
sweet
but
there
is
also
a
large
amount
of
alcohol
it
feels
thick
and
well
carbonation
and
overall
is
another
good
belgian
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
actively
carbonated
taste
was
dry
adstringent
of
the
dryness
and
bitterness
typical
tripel
beer
yet
different
than
e
g
westmalle
or
rochefort
because
of
the
high
fermentation
grade
bitterness
and
flavours
produced
by
the
yeast
a
very
good
trappist
beer
from
belgium
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
medium
orange
with
reasonably
sized
white
head
rather
fizzy
that
dissipates
fairly
slowly
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
smells
quite
spicy
lots
of
pepper
with
lots
breadiness
and
some
light
fruits
sweet
apple
and
honey
alcoholic
overtones
are
obvious
very
bold
and
interesting
but
not
on
par
with
the
best
tripels
in
terms
of
complexity
taste
is
bitter
upfront
lots
of
spicy
hops
and
coriander
apple
buttery
tones
and
a
bit
of
breadiness
make
an
appearance
in
the
middle
before
the
alcohol
becomes
apparent
in
the
finish
very
dry
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
solid
a
very
good
if
not
spectacular
tripel
well
worth
revisiting
i
love
the
look
of
this
beer
huge
dense
head
orange
cloudy
colour
little
bits
of
sediment
yeast
floating
around
so
peaceful
to
look
at
sweet
smell
of
malts
oranges
cloves
pepper
and
cider
taste
starts
sort
of
sweet
and
sour
plenty
of
malts
mingling
with
green
apple
skins
and
citrus
fruits
with
a
bit
of
a
spicy
kick
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
leaves
mildly
bitter
with
a
floral
taste
very
thick
very
smooth
mouthfeel
i
like
it
big
bodied
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
hop
bite
to
it
a
little
astringency
and
graininess
to
this
beer
as
well
the
least
enjoyable
of
the
chimays
but
a
great
beer
taste
is
crisp
spicy
finish
that
goes
down
smooth
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
love
the
extreme
bitterness
if
your
a
hop
head
like
myself
your
will
find
this
beer
extremely
tasty
i
would
love
to
have
another
one
of
this
beer
but
the
availiability
is
low
around
my
area
a
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
not
drunk
this
is
quite
a
complex
beer
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
interesting
but
not
my
favorite
and
i
got
tired
of
it
before
the
stubby
was
empty
i
will
be
happy
to
have
this
beer
every
once
in
a
while
pours
a
cloudy
deep
gold
with
a
huge
head
good
retention
and
very
good
lace
smells
of
yeasty
wheat
malt
with
some
citrus
spicyness
yeasty
and
bitter
taste
upfront
sweetness
followed
by
the
citrus
bitterness
hop
spicy
alcohol
well
hidden
i
am
not
much
of
a
hop
head
so
this
one
does
not
appeal
to
me
much
but
a
decent
brew
none
the
less
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
colour
with
a
dense
white
medium
head
no
lacing
but
the
head
reduces
to
a
nice
white
cap
awesome
aroma
on
opening
the
bottle
fresh
spicy
and
fruity
oranges
apples
bananas
green
grapes
but
also
musty
and
yeasty
flavour
is
fairly
sharp
and
sweet
tastes
of
sweet
toasty
cakey
malt
yeasty
fresh
and
dried
fruits
and
spicy
herbal
and
citrusy
hops
right
on
style
i
would
say
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
but
appropriate
very
enjoyable
probably
best
to
leave
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
next
time
slightly
hazy
and
a
deep
gold
colour
this
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
that
showed
good
retention
and
clumpy
lacing
there
was
a
strong
bready
yeast
aroma
at
first
with
lemon
and
mild
spice
appearing
along
with
candylike
character
after
a
short
time
significant
bitterness
was
balanced
by
sugary
sweetness
citrus
and
yeast
also
contributed
by
the
mid
there
was
a
slightly
rough
alcohol
flavour
and
burn
at
the
end
followed
by
a
peppery
finish
with
lingering
hops
as
it
warmed
to
room
temperature
this
roughness
disappeared
the
high
carbonation
seemed
to
add
some
acidity
light
bodied
with
a
bit
of
slickness
and
aggressive
alcohol
warmth
overall
not
bad
at
all
but
it
seems
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
maybe
some
aging
will
smooth
it
out
a
bit
poured
to
an
attractive
amber
with
little
yeast
floaties
and
a
easy
forming
foamy
white
head
smell
is
slightly
acidic
but
not
offensive
taste
is
yeasty
slightly
bitter
but
really
smooth
abundantly
carbonated
alcohol
well
hidden
a
nice
brew
but
i
prefer
the
red
over
this
one
dont
like
it
much
too
bitter
without
a
good
flavour
balance
it
just
doesnt
make
my
mouth
happy
d
makes
you
want
more
wuite
a
bit
im
not
a
huge
tripel
fan
but
this
one
gives
you
a
strong
beer
that
can
still
be
a
little
bit
of
a
quencher
with
its
light
body
the
spiciness
in
the
taste
and
aftertaste
provide
an
intrigue
that
helps
the
drinkability
on
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
into
a
chimay
chalice
the
head
is
a
thick
and
creamy
white
with
excellent
lacing
and
retention
smell
was
that
very
particular
chimay
yeast
strain
slightly
sour
spices
hint
of
banana
taste
was
sweet
bubble
gum
up
front
with
a
bready
middle
and
a
pleasant
piney
hops
in
the
finish
quite
fizzy
in
the
mouth
but
not
inappropiate
or
overpowering
the
flavours
blend
from
one
to
the
next
very
slowly
and
it
is
definitely
a
beer
ill
be
savouring
for
a
good
half
hour
at
least
her
taste
is
bitter
floral
with
some
shy
sweet
notes
that
comes
from
the
malt
bread
flavors
are
present
with
floral
and
spicy
notes
that
comes
to
form
a
tout
an
excellent
triple
i
would
drink
this
regularly
bu
la
fin
is
cheaper
in
my
area
a
dry
yeast
ad
wheat
flavor
leads
followed
by
a
bitter
yet
balanced
hopping
merged
together
by
an
acrid
bitterness
at
the
far
outside
edges
of
the
tongue
except
for
that
bitterness
this
is
pretty
good
but
not
great
a
hint
of
sweetness
picks
up
later
on
as
the
bitterness
dies
away
d
the
beer
is
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
with
a
bit
more
body
the
finish
has
a
bitter
quality
to
it
that
interferes
with
the
soft
fruit
and
spice
qualities
overall
a
magnificent
beer
very
complex
and
satisfying
pours
a
nice
dark
honey
color
with
a
rich
thick
head
that
dissipates
into
thick
lacing
for
the
rest
of
the
brew
at
first
the
nose
was
overpowered
with
alcoholness
but
as
it
sat
a
little
i
was
able
to
smell
other
things
sweet
malts
with
some
hops
some
fruitiness
and
mild
spices
cloves
coriander
taste
starts
off
very
complex
and
nice
and
quickly
dives
into
severe
alcohol
and
bittery
sour
flavors
prior
to
the
abyss
a
nice
balance
resides
with
smooth
lightly
toasty
malts
nice
melange
of
fruits
and
spice
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
but
after
a
split
second
all
this
is
shattered
by
the
immense
bitterness
and
alcoholness
ive
had
many
high
octanes
before
that
mask
the
abv
very
well
this
one
is
mediocre
in
that
respect
first
chimay
ever
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
slight
orange
hue
nice
fluffy
white
head
which
lasted
quite
a
while
the
aroma
offered
a
few
citrus
notes
bubbles
did
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
after
the
initial
pour
the
alcohol
presence
was
noticeable
but
did
not
take
away
from
any
of
the
sweet
malt
taste
and
the
yeast
flavors
that
dominate
when
i
frothed
it
up
on
the
pallet
it
exploded
with
banana
and
coriander
very
good
ale
and
this
chimay
lived
up
to
everything
i
have
heard
cheers
up
front
no
surprise
in
the
taste
not
unlike
other
tripels
however
the
finish
is
almost
cabernet
savignon
dry
and
strong
tasty
but
no
la
fin
du
monde
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
puckering
maybe
this
is
best
with
food
not
alone
overall
this
is
a
very
wonderful
beer
a
fitting
example
of
why
the
trappist
beers
are
so
widely
respected
and
in
demand
this
isnt
the
best
trappist
brew
in
my
opinion
but
if
a
beer
this
good
isnt
the
best
that
should
point
out
to
you
the
quality
of
beers
that
come
from
the
monasteries
id
seek
this
one
out
again
this
is
definitely
the
best
beer
ever
made
enough
said
if
you
like
champagne
then
this
is
the
one
i
love
beers
that
are
strong
but
when
i
had
this
i
was
overwhelmed
i
will
never
over
rate
chimay
unless
someone
actually
makes
a
better
beer
than
this
this
is
this
the
first
beer
that
you
want
to
drink
without
getting
drunk
on
this
is
slightly
heavier
than
expected
and
the
alcohol
is
more
pronounced
than
i
have
experienced
in
some
other
triples
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
and
enjoyable
but
was
expecting
more
maybe
my
expectations
got
in
the
way
of
my
objectivity
on
this
one
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
given
i
lack
the
proper
hardware
nice
hazy
gold
color
a
little
bit
of
lacing
with
a
relatively
thing
head
that
forms
little
islands
nice
sharp
hoppy
smell
wheaty
with
some
copper
overtones
maybe
a
hint
of
corriander
taste
is
complex
again
hops
wheat
lemon
corriander
bit
of
a
copperish
taste
as
well
very
good
glides
across
my
tongue
and
finishes
with
a
nice
little
whisp
of
the
alcohol
but
not
too
strong
overall
a
nicely
balanced
beer
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
two
thumbs
up
overall
a
decent
tripel
but
not
mindblowing
especially
for
the
money
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
one
i
had
heard
that
the
white
label
chimay
was
the
weakest
of
the
three
but
the
wellbalanced
flavor
and
excellent
drinkability
really
won
me
over
worth
a
buy
after
watching
that
episode
of
the
daily
show
i
cant
make
myself
pour
beers
into
their
proper
glasses
it
just
seems
to
nerdy
but
lo
and
behold
they
still
taste
good
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
massive
head
that
looks
almost
like
shaving
cream
lots
and
lots
of
lacing
has
mild
spices
in
the
nose
but
an
overall
good
whole
clean
smell
the
taste
is
very
unique
almost
reminds
me
of
a
hefe
at
points
spices
malts

is

it

im

my

the

the
real

anyway
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
that
hasnt
already
been
better
said
below
i
tried
the
33cl
size
bottle
pours
with
a
large
white
head
well
carbonated
clear
dark
golden
yellow
color
smells
very
yeastyfruity
medium
body
a
fairly
sweet
beer
to
start
but
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
the
alcohol
seems
more
pronounced
in
the
finish
as
well
you
notice
it
but
its
not
over
powering
wow
i
think
that
the
monks
at
this
abbey
have
apparently
gotten
very
close
with
god
how
else
are
their
beers
so
consistently
amazing
this
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
frothy
thick
head
that
maintains
all
the
way
down
a
slight
bitterness
with
alcohol
and
fruity
flavors
coming
in
very
crisp
and
highly
drinkable
an
exceptional
brew
from
chimay
hazy
golden
appearance
with
a
dense
off
white
head
fruity
aroma
and
a
fine
prickly
carbonation
level
but
considerably
smoother
than
other
trippels
that
are
too
champagne
like
peppery
yeast
spiciness
pricks
at
the
taste

sweetness

subtle
grape

warming

is
pleasant
and
not
overwhelming
delicious
notes
yet
another
outstanding
unique
and
complex
beer
from
abbaye
de
scourmont
wonderful
stuff
very
nice
not
as
complex
as
some
tripels
but
sometimes
you
want
something
that
is
not
so
assertive
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
flavour
profile
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
westmalle
tripel
taste
crisp
and
carbonated
at
first
which
melds
into
maltyyeasty
smoothness
there
is
a
tart
aftertaste
a
thin
finish
i
dont
like
it
im
sorry
xd
pours
a
deep
cloudy
gold
with
a
foamier
white
head
the
head
is
sticky
and
leaves
small
lacing
once
it
settles
down
the
aroma
is
primarily
fruity
and
yeasty
with
hints
of
spices
the
taste
amps
this
profile
up
with
the
addition
of
a
strong
malty
backbone
reminiscent
of
english
bitter
the
body
isnt
too
heavy
but
has
a
nice
fullness
to
it
with
just
a
little
carbonation
on
the
finish
overall
quite
yummy
a
great
sipping
beer
been
looking
for
it
for
about
four

this
beer
is
kicking
nice
but
this
is
a

a
whole
lot
raising

on

tongue
and
the

tangy
sharp

bitterness
finishes
solidly
but
a
honey
sweetness
lingers
long
after
the
short
lived
bittering
the
flavors
arent
terribly
complex
but
i
do
rather
enjoy
it
my
new
favorite
very
sophisticated
but
pairs
well
with
something
as
simple
as
pizza
love
it
so
i
know
its
a
tripel
and
therefore
has
a
higher
abv
still
this
is
a
sneaky
bastard
pours
a
rich
dark
orange
with
a
finebubbled
white
head
aroma
starts
with
the
yeasty
bready
and
moves
into
spice
and
some
caramel
sweetness
flavor
is
a
more
intense
version
therein
but
with
a
slight
reversal
the
spice
notes
start
followed
by
the
fruity
esters
to
me
a
brighter
dried
fruit
more
like
golden
raisins
and
cranberries
or
currants
the
yeasty
flavors
are
of
a
fresher
hay
and
it
finishes
with
a
tart
not
sour
dryness
not
unlike
a
champagne
the
problem
here
is
that
this
lightermedium
bodied
tripel
washes
across
the
tongue
pretty
easily
and
the
10
abv
which
is
fairly
well
hidden
can
sneak
up
on
you

chuggable
coming
out

a

color
however
once
inside
the
glass
it
becomes
more
of
a
mixture
of
a
brown

golden
color
aroma
is
malty
sweet
it
reminds
me
of
a
combination
of
brown

finish

a

active

overall
a
very

beer
perhaps
somewhat
overwhelming
the
overall
dryness
and
bitterness
is
somewhat
over
the
top
drinking
this
beer
alone
you
will
definitely
get
quite
a
buzz
however
as
the
brothers
mentioned
it
might
be
better
with
a
hearty
meal
i
had
this
beer
with
some
cheese
and
salami
next
time
i
would
like
to
try
it
with
a
full
meal
o
this
is
definately
a
good
tripel
personally
i
favor
beers
with
even
less
body
and
more
drinkability
not
that
this
isnt
drinkable
for
a
tripel
i
can
imagine
this
beer
working
nice
with
cheeses
and
also
for
a
dessert

content
beers
i
enjoyed
this
beer
even
though
it
might
be
a
bit
sweet
for
some
i
think
the
belgian
yeast
combines
with
this
sweetness
to
give
that
wine
taste
at
the
end
note
to
self
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
as
i
could
see
my
enjoyment
different
at
a
different
time
it
reminded
me
of
a
complex
wine
with
new
flavors
every
second
a
friendly
tripel
with
a
milder
tartness
and
condiments
but
still
with
a
dangerously
hidden
alcohol
punch
i
do
prefer
their
blonde
and
bruin
versions
though
overall
i
love
it
possibly
the
best
tripel
i
have
had
so
far
at
least
but
if
you
are
a
fan
of
tripels
try
this
overall
a
very
solid
beer
some
interesting
flavours
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
maybe
not
a
world
class
brew
but
still
tasty
and
worth
trying
definitely
a
sipping
beer
but
subtle
enough
to
overindulge
o
slightly
sweeter
than
i
expected
for
a
tripel
based
on
the
other
examples
that
i
have
enjoyed
recently
also
very
highly
rated
ones
nice
amounts
of
complexity
and
all
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
quite
harmonious
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
definitely
a
sipper
overall
a
really
good
beer
and
the
10
abv
doesnt
hurt
i
wouldnt
know
it
was
a
tripel
in
a
blind
taste
test
but
a
really
good
beer
my
high
ratings
are
because
it
is
a
really
good
beer
not
a
good
tripel
a
good
but
not
great
tripel
mais
uma
cerveja
que
eu
resolvi
esquecer
tudo
que
li
sobre
ela
para
tirar
a
minha
própria
verdade
na
garrafa
ela
já
havia
me
surpreendido
mas
nada
se
comparou
a
provála
na
pressão
foi
uma
experiência
única
uma
cerveja
poderosa
encorpada
e
de
personalidade
incrível
algo
inesquecível
o
didnt
really
enjoy
this
one
as
much
as
i
first
anticipated
it
sat
long
and
dry
in
my
mouth
and
didnt
really
have
any
smelltaste
that
i
enjoyed
odid
not
taste
the
alcohol
like
i
thought
i
would
and
got
some
taste
in
this
tripel
that
i
had
not
had
before
overall
nice
almost
a
staple
for
a
good
strong
belgian
beer
has
all
the
nice
components
but
the
booze
and
carbonation
get
in
the
way
a
little
too
much
to
really
make
it
nice
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
seems
a
little
blunt
and
forceful
not
the
most
drinkable
tripel
out
there
this
is
an
interesting
triple
it
is
less
clean
and
crisp
than
other
triples
and
more
funky
and
yeasty
i
dont
love
it
but
i
dont
hate
it
i
will
probably
try
it
again
overall
a
very
good
yet
atypical
triple
it
makes
up
for
its
lack
of
malty
hoppy
and
spicy
flavors
with
a
bright
bold
and
fruity
character
which
when
combined
with
an
overt
dryness
creates
something
that
walks
the
line
between
special
and
strange
as
a
fan
of
many
strange
things
ill
be
having
it
again
o
i
do
not
care
for
it
i
do
not
get
much
flavor
at
all
no
depth
just
a
boozy
warmth
and
i
want
more
may
be
blasphemy
on
ba
but
i
have
had
much
better
from
belgium
new
york
canada
and
yes
pennsylvania
always
glad
i
tried
but
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
overall
i
liked
this
over
say
golden
monkey
from
victory
but
thats
not
saying
much
since
i
dont
dabble
with
the
style
that
often
still
from
the
makers
of
duvel
its
pretty
smooth
not
worth
picking
up
again
though
since
it
had
a
massive
5
dollar
price
tag
o
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
tripel
i
felt
that
it
didnt
have
much
flavor
to
back
up
the
huge
alcohol
presence
there
wasnt
any
particular
part
of
the
beer
that
i
found
impressive
the
fortunate
sideeffect
of
drinking
this
beer
is
that
its

outstanding
brew
i
originally
had
it
on
tap
and
have
been
wanting
to
have
it
again
but
the
yard
house
couldnt
keep
it
in
stock
so
i
was
pretty
stoked
when
i
found
it
at
bevmo
tonight
i
am
very
happy
i
tried
it
from
the
bottle
very
good
would
definitely
want
to
have
this
again
final
thoughts
tripels
used
to
be
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
the
more
i
drink
them
the
higher
they
rank
in
my
opinion
its
amazing
how
a
big
10
abv
brew
can
feel
so
light
and
yet
pack
so
much
flavor
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
o
this
is
an
extremely
clean
wellmade
beer
but
for
me
it
lacks
anything
to
make
it
truly
distinctive
as
a
tripel
a
little
more
body
and
some
interesting
yeast
notes
would
push
it
over
the
top
for
me
quite
good
overall
at
4
a
bottle
its
a
good
tripel
though
a
bit
unconventional
in
its
profile
good
with
a
burger
tacos
a
great
beer
for
a
picnic
to
pair
i
would
recommend
a
good
quality
hamburger
or
some
skewered
prawns
or
jambalaya
you
can
do
a
lot
with
this
beer
get
creative
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
smooth
gently
foamy
mouthfeel
that
is
soft
and
generally
pleasant
very
faint
ethanol
can
be
felt
in
the
nostrils
and
on
the
back
of
the
throat
otherwise
this
10
abv
beer
is
highly
deceptive
closes
fairly
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
i
am
drinking
while
watching
drinking
made
easy
great
show
also
three
sheets
is
also
awesome
you
can
find
some
episodes
on
youtube
but
i
bought
all
of
the
dvds
o
its
pretty
much
awesome
yet
too
heavy
for
drinking
without
something
eaten
in
your
belly
pleasant
to
sip
on
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
and
the
forefront
but
the
phenols
in
this
beer
are
great
this
ia
quite
a
good
beer
and
as
far
as
tripels
gotta
be
top
ten
overall
muy
deliciosio
i
almost
wish
i
had
a
fresh
bottle
to
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
with
my
presumption
is
the
fresh
bottle
would
be
snappier
less
integrated
and
have
a
teenagers
personality
compared
with
this
the
mellowed
30something
that
appreciates
time
and
experience
the
perfect
combination
of
light
enough
but
still
quite
flavorful
great
for
hot
weather
overall
a
very
good
beer
to
have
along
with
a
good
meal
overall
an
ok
tripel
but
far
from
the
best
out
there
i
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
much
dryer
worth
picking
up
though
poured
this
tripel
into
a
chimay
tulip
and
a
thick
white
head
appears
with
excellent
retention
and
average
lacing
golden
amber
appearance
that
is
moderately
hazy
nose
of
bread
pear
and
belgian
yeast
taste
follows
this
profile
with
belgian
yeastfunk
and
expected
alcohol
with
slightly
thinner
than
expected
mouthfeel
overall
a
better
than
average
tripel
that
is
deceptively
drinkable
and
might
sneak
up
on
you
overall
a
not
fruitysweet
brew
as
i
would
expect
the
bitter
alcoholic
finish
isnt
that
appealing
to
me
i
liked
the
honey
touch
though
magnificent
appeareance
definitely
in
the
belgian
style
but
next
time
i
would
dare
to
try
a
new
tripel
or
have
another
one
i
like
better
worth
a
try
but
might
not
have
it
again
overall
a
pretty
good
belgian
ale
more
caramel
malt
than
usual
for
the
style
but
it
works
well
good
use
of
yeast
and
spices
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
i
prefered
the
blonde
and
brown
as
the
alcohol
isnt
as
overpowering
in
those
an
alright
triple
but
not
one
id
run
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
oi
did
not
have
great
recollections
about
maredsous
when
i
sat
down
to
drink
this
brew
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
although
this
beer
may
be
a
touch
herbal
or
grassy
for
the
style
and
although
the
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
and
a
touch
harsh
compared
with
the
best
tripels
i
found
it
pleasing
and
quite
drinkable
for
10
abv
lastly
this
was
a
good
looking
beer
final
thoughts
well
i
called
it
the
tripel
was
the
one
of
my
three
maredsous
bottles
that
ended
up
disappointing
its
still
good
and
maybe
it
didnt
age
quite
right
in
my
fridge
but
i
much
preferred
the
blonde
and
dubbel
overall
a
solid
tripel
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
best
examples
out
there
overall
interesting
things
going
on
here
this
strikes
me

like

a

emphasized
by
the

o
good
belgian
strong
ale
that
you
must
drink
slowly
surely
not
my
first
choice
but
enjoyable
beer

good
and

on
the

there
is

this

has
a
lower

with
a
slightly
crisp

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
really
tasty
but
quite
strong
o
very
strange
tripel
for
sure
has
a
sort
of
musty
stale
flavor
to
it
kinda
funky
like
its
somewhat
sour
but
its
really
hard
to
tell
very
yeasty
and
earthy
for
sure
overall
i
enjoyed
this
quite
well
its
a
little
overpriced
considering
what
i
paid
for
it
but
at
least
it
offers
a
rich
and
robust
flavor
which
any
tripel
fan
can
enjoy
rjt
overall
great
beer
is
very
hard
to
disappoint
it
is
even
easier
to
love
grab
a
glass
and
enjoy
what
you
been
missing

the

abbey

tradition
of

community
of
maredsous
abbey
the
beer
is
refermented
in
the

during

maredsous

be

degrees

or

degrees

contains
barley

overall
a
good
brew
for
sitting
and
sipping
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
but
this
makes
it
is
nice
and
warming
and
when
mixed
with
the
fruity
and
yeasty
flavors
it
goes
rather
well
o
a
very
complex
beer
that
deserves
time
to
be

and
not

detracts

overall
the
beer
is
tasty
and
strong
not
the
best
belgian
triple
that
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
good
at
times
the
brew
is
almost
a
little
skunky
worth
a
try
overall
great
beer
ill
definitely
have
it
again
and
ill
be
trying
the
other
maredsous
soon
too
that
being
said
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
but
this
is
certainly
worthy
of
its
place
pours
out
a
clear
medium
copper
color
the
head
is
dense
and
rocky
with
superb
retention
im
getting
a
lot
of
lacing
on
this
one
looks
great
in
the
nose
you
get
sour
apricot
light
grains
and
floral
hops
and
a
belgium
spiciness
not
to
mention
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
mostly
getting
some
fruits
fig
apricot
banana
also
picking
up
yeast
and
a
soft
clove
spice
alcohol
is
again
present
the
mouth
feel
is
soft
and
fairly
creamy
carbonation
is
pleasant
a
straight
up
solid
triple
its
a
little
different
then
average
has
a
bit
of
sourness
to
it
its
good
stuff
none
the
less
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
plenty
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
a
little
astringent
too
at
least
for
a
tripel
a
decent
tripel

slight

overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
tripel
good
complexity
and
balance
with
nice
smoothness
i
dont
think
i
will
drink
this
anymore
o
a
good
tripel
not
quite
great
but
i
would
have
another
if
it
was
offered
to
me
i
would
not
seek
it
out
overall
what
a
great
quaff
as
it
is
quite
filling
though
one
will
be
enough
but
i
will
have
this
one
again
and
again
maybe
its
been
too
long
since
i
had
triples
but
while
enjoying
this
one
i
can
rank
it
in
the
top
ten
or
so
that
i
remember
having
d
its
a
good
beer
but
i
think
its
not
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
there
are
better
examples
to
be
had
doa
overall
a
good
beersolid
interesting
and
drinkablethough
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
for
sure
m
d
this
tripel
i
find
to
just
not
have
an
acceptable
level
of
drinkability
it
is
flat
cloying
and
is
like
a
chore
to
finish
due
to
its
heavy
sweet
cumbersome
construction
lacking
pleasure
and
inspiration
overall
great
triple
well
balanced
for
a
10abv
you
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
excellent
beer
mvery
light
and
bubbly
lacing
on
glass
is
phenomenal
instead
of
drinking
ipas
in
the
summer
i
may
switch
to
this
very
good
tripel
in
my
books
overall
its
a
nicely
done
beer
however
for
a
trappist
ale
i
find
it
disappointing
my
expectations
were
much
higher
o
not
right
up
my
alley
but
a
phenomenal
beer
nonetheless
recommended
to
anyone
crazy
for
belgian
tripels
drinkability
it
is
a
solid
brew
i
really
have
nothing
else
to
say
o
i
am
not
much
of
a
connoisseur
of
tripels
this
only
makes
a
few
so
i
am
still
learning
i
do
not
believe
many
belgian
beers
will
break
into
my
top
favorites
this
certainly
has
not
but
i
am
excited
to
continue
the
exploration
it
is
a
beer
worthy
of
consumption
even
if
this
particular
brew
is
not
your
taste
over
all
this
triple
is
certainly
worth
a
try
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
this
tripel
seems
a
little
over
done
ill
stand
by
my
initial
impression
one
of
the
best
tripels
on
draft
not
nearly
as
good
in
a
bottle
overall
its
a
great
beer
maybe
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
delicious
in
its
own
right
lovely
and
i
now
remember
why
i
enjoy
it
on
occasion
o
a
very
nice
tripel
ive
paired
this
with
some
spicy
fauxbuffalo
wings
before
and
it
went
very
well
spicy
foods
seem
to
mask
some
of
the
astringency
and
alcohol
people
dont
like
about
it
the
750
takes
a
while
to
get
through
for
this
one
so
i
would
suggest
the
stubby
bottle
for
most
especially
if
you
are
a
virgin
to
this
big
beer
it
might
hurt
a
little
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
a
nice
brew
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
is
still
nice
could
use
with
a
bit
of
smoothing
out
some
age
perhaps
kind
of
thrown
off
by
the
artificial
grape
taste

one

full

medium

quite
boozy
and
medicinal
tasting
at
first
but
seems
to
fade
as
it
arms
a
bit
far
better
tripels
out
there
than
this
still
decent
but
probably
wont
come
back
to
this
one
to
be
honest
solid
offering
drier
and
more
peppery
than
i
am
used
to
but
if
you
like
something
without
massive
candied
sugar
malt
profile
that
finishes
crisp
dry
you
will
enjoy
his
one
a
bit
dark
in
terms
of
color
a
bit
heavy
in
terms
of
esters
and
a
bit
high
in
terms
of
alcoholthis
is
not
necessarily
a
classic
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
however
who
cares
its
quite
tasty
smells
fantastic
and
is
brisk
and
refreshing
especially
given
its
10
abv
highly
recommended
overall
great
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
very
interesting
aromas
and
tastes
looks
amazing
in
a
snifter
o
very
decent
triple
from
a
respectable
brewery
overall
maredsous
10
is
a
solid
beer
but
falls
a
little
short
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
wonder
if
a
little
more
time
in
the
bottle
would
help
to
smooth
over
some
of
the
rough
edges
i
guess
ill
have
to
get
another
bottle
to
test
this
theory
overall
i
see
why
this
one
is
so
popular
one
of
the
nicer
tripels
that
ive
tried
to
date
o
glad
i
picked
this
one
was
a
good
drink
very
enjoyable
smell
is
with
some
yeastnotes
taste
is
soft
and
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
o
a
good
way
off
with
the
spice
profile
and
alcohol
feel
youd
look
for
in
a
tripel
o
generally
speaking
it
is
not
a
bad
triple
the
taste
is
not
of
the
same
quality
of
top
triples
the
suspected
presence
of
the
metallic
and
the
honey
taste
make
it
the
triple
less
good
if
you
keep
on
drinking
it
even
gets
a
bit
nasty
this
pours
a
nice
bronze
color
with
a
creamy
large
long
lasting
head
the
smell
is
raisins
booziness
spices
and
malts
the
feel
is
great
medium
to
thick
and
creamy
which
good
carbonation
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
plenty
of
malts
low
hoppiness
although
there
is
a
nice
semi
spicy
finish
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
didnt
realize
how
potent
it
was
until
i
started
to
feel
it
the
mouthfeels
good
it
is
lively
overall
its
a
great
beer
to
have
because
its
very
accessible
to
a
lot
of
people
you
probably
can
find
this
across
the
country
with
relative
ease
i
suppose
it
could
be
a
good
gateway
to
other
belgian
beers
a
decent
standard
to
measure
other
tripels
against
as
there
are
a
number
of
beers
that
i
consider
both
better
and
worse
than
this
offering
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
tripels
that
are
a
bit
on
the
fruitier
and
sweeter
side
slightly
revised
upon
tasting
in
dec
2012
some
really
nice
ester
flavors
come
out
strong
after
warming
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
dry
overall
this
is
a
little
different
from
most
other
tripels
i
know
not
dominated
by
banana
or
cloves
but
its
pretty
tasty
this
is
an
amazing
amazing
beer
overall
a
bit
heavy
for
a
triple
but
the
taste
was
not
too
overbearing
for
me
i
have
bought
this
several
times
and
always
enjoyed
it
like
some
other
reviewers
have
suggested
it
would
go
way
better
with
a
meal
than
drank
alone
overall
this
beer
is
a
very
good
solid
beer
tripels
are
my
favorite
beer
and
even
though
this
is
extremely
different
from
any
other
tripel
i
have
had
before
o
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
if
not
outstanding
a
surprisingly
smooth
tripel
mostly
devoid
of
booze
at
least
compared
to
others
in
the
style
wouldnt
be
the
first
tripel
id
pick
up
at
a
store
from
the
crowd
but
still
something
that
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
either
t
banana
brown
sugar
candi
sugar
honey
and
a
touch
of
booze
pretty
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
works
well
with
the
flavors
i
think
if
the
alcohol
was
turned
down
a
bit
not
so
much
from
an
abv
point
of
view
but
if
it
was
hidden
or
balanced
a
bit
better
this
would
be
an
easier
beer
to
drink
and
receive
higher
marks
its
not
bad
by
any
stretch
just
a
bit
much
man
did
this
one
fool
me
poured
a
beautiful
clear
amber
head
was
above
average
for
a
trippel
fruity
mallty
and
yeasty
im
loving
the
smell
hmmmm
the
taste
is
there
but
i
feel
like
im
swallowing
something
very
astringent
would
have
been
alot
better
if
not
for
that
aftertaste
medium
consistency
with
a
very
dry
finish
another
superb
offering
from
this
brewery
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
i
could
smell
mostly
grape
and
whit
wine
the
alcohol
is
very
detectable
and
there
is
a
hint
of
banana
the
taste
has
lots
of
alcohol
and
fruit
flavors
such
as
grape
orange
and
lemon
it
starts
off
sweet
then
a
slight
tartness
hits
your
cheeks
and
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
the
beer
is
light
but
full
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
a
good
triple
tripels
are
just
really
not
my
favorite
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
belgian
yeast
and
some
earthy
spice
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
as
it
warmed
up
the
flavors
of
grains
and
subtle
spice
notes
really
come
alive
as
time
passed
by
on
this
one
the
mouthfeel
had
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
its
worth
looking
into
for
sure
overall
this
is
an
average
tripel
but
with
so
many
other
better
ones
i
dont
expect
to
come
back
to
this
one
anytime
soon

the

is
full

notes
i
also
get
some

notes
the

the
flavor
is
just
as
great
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
and
dark

notes
as
well
as
some
lemon
and
orange
citrus
the
pepper
and
coriander
are
also
present
in
the
flavor
as
is
a
decent
amount
of

the
beer
is

drinkable

of
the

any
beer
lover
summary
very
nice
brew
if
you
like
belgian
brews
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
give
this
or
any
maredsous
a
try
one
of
the
better
tripels
around
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
particularly
good
either
the
alcohol
presence
is
a
bit
much
for
the
style
and
the
flavors
and
aromas
just
lack
the
harmony
of
fruit
spices
and
yeast
that
i
love
in
the
best
tripels
drink
45
the
flavors
were
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
a
tripel
but
it
was
super
tasty
nonetheless
quite
enjoyable
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
nice
tripel
an
average
tripel
with
too
much
alcohol
harshness
not
something
ill
order
again
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
a
big
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
fruity
note
and
a
small
dry
candy
sugar
in
the
taste
quite
fruity
and
a
sweet
candy
sugar
flavor
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
and
small
fruity
note
in
the
aftertaste
nice
fruity
presence
and
candy
sugar
is
not
too
much
very
nice
and
enjoyable
o
different
than
most
tripels
i
have
had
in
regards
to
the
relatively
high
level
of
malt
which
i
consider
to
be
a
good
thing
the
10
abv
really
shows
in
this
one
however
and
isnt
exactly
well
hidden
a
bargain
at
3
50
a
11
2oz
it
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
at
the
bar
it
had
no
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
reminded
me
of
the
aluminum
keg
until
it
finally
opened
up
after
warming
to
about
55
degrees
i
got
a
bouquet
of
some
tropical
fruits
papaya
mango
pineapple
and
pear
it
tasted
just
as
fruity
as
the
smell
but
the
alcohol
was
not
very
well
hidden
i
dont
think
it
would
get
any
better
with
age
its
definitely
is
a
oh
i
wish
i
could
be
at
the
beach
winter
beer
the
mouth
feel
was
full
body
but
lacking
in
yeast
as
far
as
tripels
go
and
carbonation
was
non
existent
i
guess
i
should
buy
a
bottle
and
see
if
i
find
a
big
difference
would
i
have
this
beer
again
most
likely
because
it
does
offer
a
wide
range
of
aromas
had
a
nice
appearance
even
though
it
didnt
keep
a
nice
head
throughout
smelled
very
fruity
from
beginning
to
end
taste
was
also
slightly
fruity
with
an
alcohol
burn
which
i
did
not
enjoy
after
about
half
the
glass
was
gone
this
beer
really
did
a
number
on
me
since
i
didnt
realize
it
was
10
it
was
a
very
good
beer
but
i
felt
it
was
not
balanced
very
well
the
spicy
carbonated
taste
didnt
last
long
and
lent
way
to
the
burn
which
lingered
too
much
in
my
opinion
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
nice
flavor
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
would
try
it
again
light
banana
and
peach
aroma
some
light
lemongrass
and
hey
an
almost
funky
sour
note
sitting
way
in
the
back
as
well
and
a
small
touch
of
alcohol
really
surprised
me
with
a
the
depth
it
had
mixture
of
wheat
yeast
and
hops
nice
pepper
like
tones
on
the
tongue
mixed
with
lemongrass
and
a
wonderful
light
apple
like
yeast
flavor
loads
of
wheat
and
hey
and
fresh
cut
grass
flavors
the
finish
was
super
dry
with
an
all
too
familiar
lightly
sour
note
tucked
in
way
at
the
back
nicely
carbonated
with
a
good
amount
of
smoothness
to
it
this
was
a
medium
bodied
ale
slightly
lighter
then
that
without
any
thinness
though
definitely
not
too
light
or
bad
really
in
any
way
nice
and
light
with
a
good
profile
and
a
great
flavor
narrative
no
one
buys
these
old
youth
progressive
fiction
titles
i
knew
when
i
started
albert
ranking
thought
to
himself
if
only
i
had
written
a
self
help
book
or
a
book
on
mild
economics
a
memoir
or
even
a
self
aware
survey
of
publishers
rights
i
would
have
been
swooped
up
immediately
the
avion
newsprint
stand
couldnt
move
his
books
out
of
ohare
airport
but
by
a
parable
albert
stared
at
his
books
just
sitting
there
unthumbed
unmolested
by
the
general
public
why
oh
why
would
they
prefer
the
less
salacious
books
about
dragon
tattoos
and
hungry
gamers
he
couldnt
understand
why
his
book
about
an
internal
revolution
of
the
metamorphic
versus
the
igneous
beds
of
rock
was
not
selling
kids
love
geology
kids
love
revolution
with
their
anarchy
signs
how
did
these
old
stables
get
overlooked
he
folded
his
arms
knowing
that
one
day
the
public
would
come
around
and
his
sigh
simultaneously
aligned
with
thomas
pynchon
in
his
resolve
awaiting
the
return
of
postmodernism
in
tasting
i
get
the
belgian
flavors
coming
through
including
the
yeast
but
the
other
flavors
dont
balance
well
the
alcohol
continues
to
be
harsh
and
the
yeast
taste
is
a
little
off
refreshing
but
not
a
summer
beer
unless
you
wanna
pass
out
and
get
sun
burned
o
a
good
example
of
a
tripel
but
nothing
outstanding
about
it
d
a
straightforward
and
basic
tripel
good
but
nothing
extraordinary
a
decent
bang
for
your
buck
for
the
style
as
well
the
cpj
o
a
mixed
bag
here
smells
great
but
kind
of
disjointed
on
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
a
nice
tripel
with
great
characteristics
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
retaining
heads
ive
ever
seen
on
a
beer
overall
my
first
tripel
i
am
impressed
by
the
assortment
of
flavors
and
the
complexity
of
the
the
style
represented
by
this
beer
would
certainly
have
this
one
again
the
abv
is
up
there
at
10
but
hardly
discernible
in
the
tastedangerous
an
excellent
beer
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
types
of
beer
is
the
begian
tripel
and
maredsous
is
one
of
the
best
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
the
malt
taste
is
not
overly
sweet
but
is
balanced
well
with
an
almost
caramellike
finish
first
had
it
at
red
resturant
in
huntington
ny
had
it
yesterday
at
farmhouse
tap
grill
in
burlington
vermont
o
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
good
overall
it
didnt
really
leave
a
lasting
impression
however
o
an
overall
good
bear
the
sweet
notes
are
very
pleasant
and
the
high
alcohol
content
is
barley
noticable
overall
maredsous
10
may
leave
you
maredsoused
pushes
the
limit
for
me
with
alcohol
but
fairly
good
in
spite
of
it
a
good
tripel
which
of
course
was
no
surprise
the
only
surprising
thing
was
that
id
never
had
it
before
had
a
single
as
a
gift
im
not
a
big
fan
of
grape
notes
in
beer
as
they
remind
me
too
much
of
high
gravity
malt
liquors
but
they
are
not
too
prominent
here
this
was
a
sweet
tripel
not
a
whole
lot
of
spicing
in
the
taste
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
like
many
triples
you
can
taste
and
smell
the
alcohol
throughout
however
the
alcohol
is
not
so
strong
as
to
interfere
with
the
taste
of
the
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
belgian
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
and
i
am
a
bit
torn
about
how
to
rate
it
on
one
hand
it
seems
quite
hot
and
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
flavors
on
the
other
hand
it
is
very
unique
and
i
find
the
wine
like
character
to
be
quite
interesting
also
it
is
packed
with
flavor
and
quite
invigorating
to
drink
i
guess
i
would
just
have
to
say
that
if
you
are
looking
for
a
tripel
that
has
something
a
bit
different
to
offer
you
might
go
for
one
of
these
o
its
pretty
good
very
drinkable
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
though
very
white
wine
like
o
looks
delicious
but
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
look
for
me
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wont
be
getting
again
soon
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
recent
disappointments
this
was
definitely
an
enjoyable
experience
to
sample
excellent
postmeal
nightcap
purchased
a
bottle
at
whole
foods
for
3
99
poured
into
my
maredsous
stemmed
chalice
huge
creamy
white
head
is
what
grabbed
me
at
first
second
the
color
is
much
more
orange
than
most
tripels
which
tend
to
be
on
the
blonde
side
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
lacing
smell
was
yeasty
and
sweet
flavor
was
fruity
sugary
and
doughy
mouthfeel
was
good
but
not
as
potent
as
i
was
expecting
from
a
10
tripel
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
treat
for
belgian
fans
but
the
alcohol
was
not
really
present
and
the
color
threw
me
off
a
nice
version
of
the
style
but
it
could
get
lost
in
the
world
of
better
belgian
examples
o
excellent
trappistabby
style
brew
definitely
worth
drinking
any
time
of
the
year
this
triple
is
relatively
dry
and
has
lots
of
carbonation
which
makes
for
a
good
mouthfeel
overall
however
im
not
sure
how
much
of
a
fan
i
am
of
this
beer
maybe
ill
buy
one
again
if
nothing
better
is
available
overall
hot
is
the
operative
word
the
typical
cast
of
tripel
characteristics
are
here
they
just
fly
and
buzz
by
you
in
a
rocket
not
bad
just
a
little
asskick
by
the
abbeyfolk
dr
high
abv
is
well
hidden
actually
a
bit
lacking
for
a
belgian
abbey
beer
i
would
agree
that
this
should
be
shared
with
all
d
i
am
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
and
will
not
buy
it
again
it
is
not
my
type
of
triple
if
it
didnt
have
the
astringent
taste
and
mouthfeel
it
might
be
decent
d
overall
this
is
a
fairly
lackluster
example
of
a
typically
glamorous
style
it
not
only
fails
to
deliver
the
refreshingyetcomplex
spectrum
of
flavors
found
in
most
tripels
but
also
is
checkered
with
flaws
this
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
brouwerij
duvel
moortgat
the
creator
of
the
delicious
duvel
all
i
can
say
is
that
either
the
beer
needs
a
facelift
or
a
serious
reduction
in
price
da
good
example
of
the
style
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
nice
three
finger
egg
white
head
in
my
maredsous
glass
lots
of
carbonation
w
this
beer
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
really
nice
fruit
spice
alcohol
very
zippy
smelling
it
gets
your
attention
thats
for
sure
and
then
theres
the
taste
its
big
bold
and
in
my
opinion
world
class
you
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
but
its
not
overwhelming
to
me
it
adds
to
the
beer
the
fruit
and
spice
mix
well
w
the
malt
and
alcohol
to
create
a
wonderful
experience
mouthfeel
is
nice
fairly
smooth
but
theres
a
zing
at
the
end
and
the
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
while
drinkability
is
good
although
at
10
abv
id
limit
it
to
two
this
beer
always
seems
to
have
more
alcohol
in
it
than
advertised
but
i
guess
ill
believe
the
10
effectwise
it
seems
like
a
1314
to
me
anyway
ive
had
this
beer
often
and
its
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
this
beer
also
significantly
improves
the
warmer
it
gets
it
really
needs
to
be
only
slightly
chilled
below
room
temperature
to
let
all
the
flavors
out
great
beer
and
i
will
definitely
continue
to
enjoy
it
pours
a
clear
dark
golden
orange
colour
tastes
of
dark
fruits
with
a
almost
caramal
like
finish
with
the
breaded
malt
backbone
drinks
down
pretty
smooth
overall
for
the
high
10
alc
i
mostly
bought
this
gift
pack
for
the
glass
and
this
beer
was
decent
overall
tripels
usually
arent
my
thing
but
this
wasnt
a
struggle
by
any
means
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
but
certainly
not
the
best
tripel
out
there
cheers
d
flavors
and
feel
were
not
bad
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
but
a
little
too
dry
not
bad
in
general
as
a
beer
but
a
pretty
average
tripel
4
d
flavorful
and
balanced
i
think
ill
end
up
liking
this
better
than
most
reviewers
but
i
really
liked
it
to
date
i
havent
had
that
many
triples
but
the
ones
i
have
had
are
staples
of
the
style
and
much
more
preferable
than
this
its
got
the
trademark
belgian
yeast
with
a
pleasant
albeit
underwhelming
fruity
character
and
disguises
its
alcohol
content
well
but
nothing
jumps
out
at
me
with
this
seemingly
plain
rendering
of
the
style
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
in
the
future
but
still
look
forward
to
their
dubbel
drinkability
this
beer
seem
to
be
an
okay
belgian
triple
but
certainly
far
from
the
best
i
have
had
too
a
bit
high
on
alcohol
and
spice
would
liked
little
slight
more
sweetness
balance
also
appeared
just
be
overcarbonated
ehh
okay
but
nothing
id
seek
again
excellent
beet
top
notch
all
seasons
of
the
year
at
this
price
though
i
wouldnt
drink
it
too
often
poured
from
330ml
bottle
in
trappist
glass
deep
amber
color
and
gives
a
nice
lasting
foaming
head
aroma
is
malty
fruity
with
caramel
nuts
and
light
spicy
notes
flavor
is
malty
too
fruity
with
apricots
tones
ending
in
a
dry
and
slightly
wooden
alcoholic
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
this
beer
did
not
meet
my
expectations
i
look
forward
to
trying
out
the
maredsous
8
in
the
near
future
mildly
impressed
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
got
better
as
it
warmed
it
started
with
high
booze
and
carbonation
but
as
it
warmed
both
decided
to
take
a
back
seat
to
the
fruits
and
bit
of
tartness
d
a
very
tasty
tripel
and
highly
recommended
to
any
fan
of
belgians
the
fruity
flavours
are
nicely
complemented
with
the
hops
and
malts
high
abv
is
hidden
well
enough
to
make
this
one
quite
drinkable
cheers
its
not
very
alcohol
heavy
but
it
is
thick
and
not
exactly
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
for
the
level
of
heavy
mouthfeel
i
find
it
nearly
refreshing
to
a
degree
from
the
crisp
finish
d
im
going
in
have
to
wait
on
the
other
one
i
have
to
see
how
i
feel
about
it
when
the
booze
diminishes
medium
body
lively
carbonation
the
harshness
limits
drinkabiltiy
somewhat
but
its
on
the
whole
quite
refreshing
note
even
though
this
is
only
an
11
2oz
bottle
you
will
feel
the
10
alcohol
good
tripel
i
was
realy
impressed
as
ive
never
tried
it
before
and
i
bought
it
by
chance
at
brussels
airport
poured
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
good
thick
head
that
disappears
slowly
from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
with
abv
and
bestby
date
on
the
label
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
fruity
esters
yeast
hint
of
spices
and
alcohol
taste
is
a
very
nice
blend
of
malt
caramel
sweetness
fruity
esters
with
a
crisp
tart
finish
very
good
carbonation
and
lacing
along
the
glass
the
drinkability
for
me
in
spite
of
the
high
abv
was
very
good
this
is
surely
a
tripel
that
should
be
tried
and
i
am
sure
i
will
have
it
in
the
future
decent
brew
and
well
worth
trying
the
booze
could
be
a
little
better
concealed
but
no
reason
to
avoid
it
drink
not
the
best
triple
i
have
had
but
i
really
like
that
spice
note
behind
it
d
ok
the
sherry
was
a
little
offputting
and
it
went
down
about
as
easily
sweet
beers
are
not
really
my
thing
and
this
one
was
about
as
sweet
as
they
get
in
terms
of
drinkability
its
a
fine
beer
but
it
not
at
all
sessionable
i
could
barely
finish
half
a
pint
sized
bottle
nice
full
body
smooth
mouthfeel
but
the
carbonation
makes
this
beer
almost
light
in
flavor
excellent
food
beer
one
of
the
stronger
tripels
that
ive
thus
far
run
into
and
still
easy
enough
to
sip
away
the
night
with
the
rounded
abv
in
particular
being
surprisingly
agreeable
d
very
drinkable
beer
had
some
chicks
that
were
out
that
night
that
do
not
even
like
drinking
beer
and
actually
enjoyed
it
very
relaxed
beer
pours
a
wellcarbonated
cloudy
gold
with
good
head
on
top
of
a
tart
sour
fruit
smell
of
grapeskin
and
pear
maybe
cherries
and
there
is
some
oakiness
and
hint
of
that
belgian
yeast
strain
that
is
so
prevelant
sweet
malt
sensations
seem
muted
starts
out
sweet
and
sticky
with
a
slight
caramel
malt
base
and
has
a
biting
sharpness
thankts
to
the
carbonation
and
citric
hop
bitterness
there
are
some
minor
fruit
tastes
that
are
not
so
much
tropical
but
more
like
sour
grape
or
apple
a
dry
crisp
finish
complements
w
wellhidden
abv
a
not
perfect
triple
but
one
that
is
musttry
d
nice
a
quality
tripel
worth
revisiting
d
this
was
one
of
the
best
tasting
tripels
ive
ever
had
just
delicious
scent
and
body
were
good
to
but
not
as
good
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
this
style
of
beer
isnt
really
known
for
improving
with
age
but
this
one
might
be
an
exception
and
yet
its
already
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
fresh
d
took
a
few
hauls
to
get
into
but
it
does
have
a
nice
belgian
character
although
the
high
alcohol
and
chemically
aspects
are
a
little
distracting
but
sometimes
thats
the
price
you
have
to
pay
for
10
abv
a
decent
tripel
d
drinkability
is
moderate
while
the
nose
and
taste
arent
exactly
leading
the
pack
it
certainly
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
at
the
end
serves
as
an
excuse
to
go
in
for
another
sip
and
indulge
in
the
fruity
sweet
goodness
d
this
is
just
a
good
beer
nothing
overwhelming
or
wowing
but
well
balanced
and
tasty
drinkability
again
a
tasty
but
different
tripel
one
i
think
could
gain
fans
among
white
wine
and
champagne
lovers
drinkability
overall
is
standout
solid
the
type
of
triple
ive
come
to
love
not
overly
sweet
a
nice
tropical
fruit
base
with
hints
of
hops
and
alcohol
with
bready
spicy
dry
yeast
base
dangerously
drinkable
disappears
way
too
quickly
even
in
the
750
ml
portion
overall
i
really
wasnt
pleased
with
this
beer
i
expected
to
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
but
it
was
cidery
and
a
bit
harsh
i
did
not
enjoy
drinking
this
overall
i
am
glad
i
took
a
chance
with
this
beer
and
i
liked
it
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
triples
but
every
time
i
try
one
i
find
myself
making
a
mental
not
to
track
down
more
of
this
style
i
would
buy
this
again
d
easy
to
drink
and
fairly
sharp
tasting
not
too
complex
though
they
balanced
the
beer
pretty
well
and
hid
the
abv
quite
well
too
but
it
seemed
to
lack
a
bit
on
character
all
in
all
a
good
beer
though
md
carbonation
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
maybe
a
bit
to
alcoholic
this
triple
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
amber
color
and
is
slightly
darker
than
i
expected
the
head
is
substantial
and
about
1
finger
lasts
as
you
drink
along
with
some
good
lacing
the
taste
is
a
little
bland
for
a
triple
though
good
the
10
alcohol
is
subtle
in
this
beer
unfortunately
so
are
all
of
the
rest
of
the
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
good
i
was
just
hoping
for
more
flavor
d
a
very
good
tripel
not
among
the
elite
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
long
as
you
dont
mind
the
alcohol
flavor
probably
not
worth
seeking
out
but
definitely
worth
drinking
drinkability
quite
high
yet
still
something
that
i
could
see
getting
me
in
trouble
d
good
drinkability
cant
say
that
with
the
abv
i
could
handle
more
than
a
few
bottles
served
in
a
maredsous
chalice
pours
a
beautiful
translucent
copper
with
a
quarter
inch
loose
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
loose
consistent
skim
nose
expresses
candi
sugar
citrus
and
a
light
herbal
quality
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
herbal
quality
presenting
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
closer
to
light
with
a
mild
even
effervescence
a
solid
example
of
the
style
with
all
the
qualities
i
look
for
in
a
tripel
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
with
a
nice
balance
and
a
wellhidden
abv
d
medium
medium
plus
body
with
average
carbonation
middling
drinkability
im
thinking
i
will
not
be
averse
to
another
but
i
wont
be
pining
for
one
either
d
great
to
try
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
will
be
the
one
that
will
have
me
running
back
for
more
i
could
drink
a
session
of
10
brews
but
this
one
does
not
hide
it
as
well
as
others
d
a
good
standard
belgian
great
relaxation
beer
not
bad
but
there
are
many
better
while
this
is
a
decent
triple
there
is
something
just
a
bit
off
about
it
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
not
one
of
the
better
ones
either
this
is
a
tasty
tripel
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
does
things
pretty
well
it
doesnt
overdo
the
sweetness
which
is
a
plus
more
spiciness
would
have
been
welcomed
the
abv
is
pretty
high
though
and
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
definitely
not
for
lightweights
d
drinkable
although
not
in
the
top
range
of
my
tripels
d
incredibly
sweet
for
a
tripel
and
not
quite
to
my
liking
the
10
cant
hide
but
all
considered
this
is
a
fascinating
and
worthwhile
beer
i
may
not
buy
one
again
anytime
soon
but
id
leap
at
the
chance
to
drink
one
if
it
were
randomly
offered
ripe
rich
and
satisfying
if
not
transcendent
having
gone
through
a
number
of
these
as
well
as
having
one
on
tap
i
thought
i
should
add
a
review
great
looking
beer
nice
orange
tint
to
it
great
funky
musty
aromas
along
with
bread
and
citrus
i
really
like
the
crispness
of
this
beer
nice
amount
of
malt
to
go
with
the
citrus
fruit
this
is
one
extremely
drinkable
tripel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
jd
drinkabilitynotes
this
is
a
tasty
albeit
not
perfect
tripel
it
is
definitely
not
my
favorite
bt
it
is
a
drinkable
and
pleasant
beer
it
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
tripels
but
i
definitely
suggest
moving
on
to
orval
for
a
more
complex
and
idiosyncratic
example
of
the
style
right
off
i
get
a
bit
of
iron
on
the
taste
but
then
i
get
an
awesome
full
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
and
a
slightly
hot
buy
dry
finish
theres
some
sweet
rich
malt
but
this
isnt
a
very
complex
beer
its
decent
but
id
preer
regular
duvel
over
this
if
im
staying
with
this
brand
or
id
get
westmalle
tripel
if
i
still
wanted
a
tripel
another
liter
of
belgian
ale
tis
the
season
i
guess
might
be
another
for
the
wow
files
too
lets
see
shall
we
head
pours
meringue
smooth
and
peaked
at
least
two
inches
and
slowly
dissapates
huge
slightlymetallic
aroma
some
raisins
some
definite
hop
character
to
it
color
is
a
clear
brilliant
amber
flavor
is
really
carbonated
and
bright
very
robust
hop
character
and
the
yeast
is
very
forward
more
hops
than
i
expected
actually
some
alcohol
flavors
in
this
10
abv
brew
has
its
complexities
but
not
as
wow
as
i
hoped
finish
is
long
and
carries
some
of
the
good
hop
bitterness
this
is
just
a
step
below
a
worldclass
ale
but
is
still
a
tad
on
the
expensive
side
at
10
40pint
9
4
oz
not
in
the
same
class
as
yesterdays
drink
of
st
bernardus
abt
12
a
truly
worldclass
ale
but
very
good
and
worth
drinking
edit
lowered
drinkability
to
a
4
after
another
bottle
alcohol
more
apparentdistracting
than
i
had
first
noticed
d
albeit
usual
this
is
a
very
solid
tripel
and
i
really
recommend
it
more
then
likely
i
would
not
buy
this
again
unless
it
was
on
sale
there
are
better
belgian
tripel
beers
out
there
it
was
okay
not
enough
zest
to
be
a
fave
and
it
burns
too
much
but
things
doing
nonetheless
d
not
the
best
example
in
terms
of
flavor
or
smoothness
i
was
left
wanting
a
bit
more
from
this
one
sipping
one
of
these
was
more
than
enough
d
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
tripel
the
only
place
it
comes
a
little
short
is
in
the
appearance
due
to
the
darker
color
that
borders
on
the
high
end
of
the
style
limits
not
a
bad
beer
despite
the
rating
just
a
sub
par
tripel
poured
into
my
grimbergen
goblet
pours
a
creamy
white
head
and
light
amber
aroma
is
spicy
cinnamon
white
pepper
the
high
abv
is
notable
up
front
but
in
a
pleasant
warming
way
like
a
fine
brandy
there
is
a
notable
underlying
taste
of
malts
primarily
bready
at
10
a
couple
of
these
will
make
for
a
night
this
is
a
fine
trippel
a
lovely
beer
that
i
will
add
to
the
cellar
very
soon
it
will
seem
like
much
more
than
an
8
beer
with
a
little
time
to
mature
d
this
was
out
of
a
750ml
bottle
and
i
now
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
the
11
2oz
bottle
instead
it
was
a
little
more
astringent
that
i
would
have
liked
not
terrible
but
i
really
wasnt
into
drinking
the
second
glass
this
one
almost
seems
in
between
styles
to
me
more
of
a
belgian
pale
or
even
ipa
seemed
more
highly
hopped
than
your
standard
tripel
although
not
that
bitter
but
lots
of
hop
flavor
and
aroma
although
maybe
they
just
used
a
good
deal
of
spices
interesting
beer
t
it
has
a
nice
celery
taste
to
it
smooth
with
a
pleasant
biting
after
taste
mild
but
theres
definitely
a
mild
alcohol
undertone
to
it
from
11
2
oz
bottle
it
poured
a
beautiful
light
orange
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
that
stayed
around
perfectly
this
looks
like
an
ipa
color
smell
is
fruits
spice
sweet
malts
taste
is
spice
and
fruit
first
with
some
citrus
peel
and
clove
or
coriander
i
taste
some
musty
grassy
tastes
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
strong
side
with
a
little
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
solid
good
tripel
in
all
categories
except
drink
ability
it
would
be
hard
to
to
drink
several
of
these
but
on
taste
alone
it
is
good
i
will
say
i
liked
6
better
im
still
sold
on
this
one
as
a
very
solid
tripel
that
i
can
get
locally
dvery
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
10
abv
the
bitterness
threw
me
for
a
bit
and
is
a
bit
much
at
times
not
as
good
as
other
triples
ive
had
drinkability
given
that
chimays
triple
is
my
alltime
favorite
beer
i
expected
a
lot
from
this
beer
and
it
failed
to
live
up
to
that
at
10
a
bottle
i
will
definitely
save
my
pennies
for
chimay
instead
of
this
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
perfect
after
a
long
day
that
you
can
sit
back
relax
and
sip
on
its
enjoyable
with
its
taste
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
worth
getting
sometime
to
try
its
pretty
drinkable
id
say
i
just
might
get
some
more
of
this
for
a
tasting
or
something
this
is
one
easy
drinking
tripel
10
no
way
dangerously
tasty
with
an
amazing
mouthfeel
d
although
the
alcohol
taste
becames
more
subdued
as
i
continued
to
drink
this
it
is
still
present
throughout
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
d
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
but
youll
probably
have
to
sip
this
one
or
it
will
catch
up
to
you
its
sweeter
than
most
tripels
and
therefore
is
easier
to
drink
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
not
typical
for
the
style
but
very
nice
drinkable
for
the
abv
had
just
a
short
one
at
mcouls
in
greensboro
nc
to
try
this
serious
brew
and
it
shows
a
light
amber
color
with
a
fair
white
head
and
just
a
hint
of
lacing
i
sniff
a
skunky
aroma
perhaps
a
light
citrus
hop
note
hiding
in
there
but
nothing
too
much
else
the
tastebuds
pick
up
a
dry
hop
skunk
bread
which
is
nice
enough
but
boy
this
is
pretty
syrupy
heavy
duty
stuff
with
a
notable
alcohol
presence
this
isnt
exactly
my
favorite
style
to
begin
with
and
this
is
just
too
seriously
sweet
and
intense
to
thoroughly
enjoy
not
very
drinkable
in
my
book
forgo
this
in
favor
of
either
st
bernardus
tripel
chimay
cinq
cents
or
westmalle
tripel
in
that
order
i
was
disappointed
particularly
because
maredsous

wowed
me
with

it

i
found
it
pretty

as
far
as
the
style
goes
ive
had
much
better
soft
and
fluffy

sweet
theres
a
light
dryness
that
balances
out
the
feel

theres
lots

to
this

a

never

this
up
as
a

pack
in

because
they
were
trying
to
clear
them
out

i
had
to
give
it
a
run

without
much
of

not
real
strong
taste
is

very

but
not
as
much
shall
i
say
bang
as
i
would
like
but
very
smooth
extremely
drinkable
for
the
abv
which
gives
it
bonus
points
overall
and
decent
value
at

at
the
price
i
paid
overall
a
strong
beer
that
i
would
certainly
buy
again
at
a
good
price

such
as

would
for

consider

this

again

tripel
from
unibroue
cork
topped
750
served
in
chimay
chalice
beer
pours
super
pale
golden
slightly
cloudy
with
a
nice
white
head
sweet
aroma
reminiscent
of
cider
i
really
like
it
reminds
me
of
cbc
tripel
threat
which
is
awesome
flavor
registers
quite
a
bit
lower
on
the
sweetness
grassy
and
herbal
with
a
relatively
thin
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
and
a
hint
of
sugar
in
the
aftertaste
but
still
pretty
dry
fantastic
balance
actually
i
dont
think
it
has
the
depth
of
flavor
of
la
fin
du
monde
but
it
has
every
bit
as
much
drinkability
and
more
quite
a
delicious
treat
drinkability
is
ok
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
save
for
a
little
spiciness
on
the
backend
the
esters
are
really
strong
and
with
the
malt
give
it
a
slightly
dirty
vibe
not
their
best
effort
but
a
solid
trippel
im
getting
a
little
tired
off
the
bananas
foster
taste
of
many
belgium
blondes
so
theres
perhaps
a
negative
bias
overall
the
elusive
eau
benite
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
i
will
tell
you
that
stands
as
a
testament
of
the
fine
brewing
activity
going
down
at
unibroue
brewery
in
canada
this
is
a
tasty
tripel
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
and
then
some
notes
notable
among
trippels
for
its
tropical
fruit
note
and
crispness
feel
is
coarse
and
grainy
touch
of
citric
sweetness
on
the
finish
does
mask
the
abv
well
nose
gets
somewhat
intriguing
through
the
foam
with
warming
yet
this
is
hardly
a
tripel
in
the
classic
sense
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
to
mediumhigh
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
somewhat
fizzy
at
first
but
quickly
quiets
to
a
foamy
and
smooth
flow
across
the
palate
closes
semidry
with
slight
ethanol
warmth
in
the
nostrils
and
back
of
the
throat
d
a
modestly
boozed
tripel
from
canada
ive
had
like
12
of
their
beers
and
these
guys
are
no
joke
they
amaze
me
every
single
time
with
the
best
belgian
beer
thats
not
made
in
belgium
or
netherlands
this
really
is
some
holy
water
if
tropical
fruit
has
been
steeping
in
it
darn
it
where
is
my
cheese
this
is
a
beer
for
double
creme
or
idk
something
soft
ripened
or
chevre
killer
broue
o
although
similar
to
its
bigger
cousin
the
famous
la
fin
du
monde
this
beer
came
to
my
liking
more
because
it
is
less
yeasty
and
carbonated
while
being
more
fruity
and
drinkable
thanks
to
the
relatively
low
abv
for
a
tripel
it
is
unfortunate
that
this
is
so
hard
to
find
because
it
could
easily
become
my
goto
tripel
a
great
beer
to
be
sought
its
a
tad
sweet
but
otherwise
so
pleasant
and
refreshing
overall
its
another
amazing
brew
by
unibroue
it
just
amazes
me
how
good
they
are
at
such
a
low
price
and
so
widely
available
this
is
a
very
under
hyped
triple
imo
go
have
one
now
o
wow
for
never
having
seen
this
beer
before
what
a
find
it
is
much
more
fruity
and
sweet
than
la
fin
du
monde
but
the
sweetness
is
subdued
and
complex
where
i
would
say
la
fin
du
monde
is
a
celebration
of
pure
maltiness
eau
benite
is
a
superb
expression
of
yeast
esters
on
a
somewhat
sweeter
malt
note
it
is
comparable
to
weyerbacher
merry
monks
but
a
lot
lighter
and
subtle
and
thus
a
lot
more
drinkable
i
will
be
looking
out
for
more
of
this
tripel
in
the
future
3
5
d
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
lfdm
so
i
doubt
ill
ever
buy
this
again
even
if
im
in
the
mood
for
some
unibroue
ogood
unique
tripel
i
prefer
their
la
fin
du
monde
but
would
not
be
opposed
to
having
this
again
o
super
drinkable
tripel
one
of
the
smoothest
mouthfeels
of
any
tripel
ive
had
cant
give
it
huge
scores
due
to
the
relatively
simple
nature
of
the
beer
but
it
goes
down
so
easy
and
is
delicious
to
boot
to
be
frank
this
is
better
than
la
fin
du
monde
overall
4
5
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
best
triples
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
light
airy
but
at
the
same
time
it
presents
an
amazing
depth
of
taste
and
smell
the
label
has
a
lot
of
fun
with
angelic
imagery
but
this
is
one
angelic
and
miraculous
brew
highly
recommended
o
very
good
example
of
the
style
thats
all
i
can
really
say
until
i
improve
my
palate
o
a
very
solid
enjoyable
tripel
its
basically
a
pilsner
if
it
was
brewed
with
belgian
yeast
tons
of
malt
flavor
but
still
very
complex
it
isnt
mind
blowing
but
its
worth
the
price
and
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
in
the
future
overall
though
its
been
a
few
years
since
i
last
had
la
fin
du
monde
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
appreciably
different
minus
a
few
ticks
on
the
alcohol
scale
which
is
fine
by
me
really
drink
it
was
tasty
but
not
up
to
par
with
la
fin
du
monde
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurts
the
body
and
flavor
of
this
beer
mostly
yeast
driven
with
a
nice
hop
balance
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
good
head
and
minor
lace
aroma
is
one
of
that
typical
yeasty
orangelike
belgian
strain
as
well
as
some
sweetness
from
candi
sugar
which
is
typical
description
mind
you
and
something
like
tropical
or
just
plush
fruit
esters
the
mouthfeel
is
more
of
the
same
light
spices
poke
your
tongue
as
the
body
is
light
and
somewhat
creamy
so
it
passes
over
the
tongue
real
easy
and
the
lowerthanusual
abv
doesnt
punish
you
at
all
beer
tastes
great
as
it
is
a
not
an
exceptional
triple
but
is
wellcrafted
and
a
great
beer
to
have
not
to
sound
redundant
the
balance
between
not
only
the
spices
but
malts
and
fruit
is
great
as
i
get
a
lightfruity
beer
with
something
like
tropical
fruit
magno
pineapple
and
other
fruits
like
apple
pear
orange
banana
the
last
two
are
lightly
noticed
along
with
some
sweet
malt
tastes
a
great
triple
that
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
and
is
a
must
try
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
small
snifter
golden
body
slighly
hazy
big
fluffy
white
head
with
soapy
lacing
aroma
is
wispy
banana
clove
and
that
strong
strong
pleasant
prominent
unibroue
tripel
yeast
awesome
taste
is
slightly
spicy
banana
slight
candi
sugar
and
again
the
yeast
dominates
amazingly
drinkable
and
just
delicious
all
around
the
alcohol
and
fruit
palate
sensations
keep
the
beer
balanced
toward
the
sweetness
i
would
prefer
a
sturdier
hop
character
to
reel
in
the
earthy
complex
and
genuine
taste
of
belgium
had
this
on
tap
the
appearance
was
not
the
most
pleasing
shade
of
murky
yellow
but
this
is
just
a
small
deduction
the
head
was
average
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
aroma
was
wonderful
with
hints
of
pineapple
and
very
sweet
candy
taste
i
found
generally
to
be
quite
similar
to
la
fin
du
monde
only
turned
up
a
notch
in
the
sweetness
department
its
of
course
got
that
signature
ale
on
lees
unibroue
stamp
which
i
love
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
the
breadiness
herbspices
and
crisp
yeast
aspects
balance
out
the
sweetness
well
the
fact
that
it
is
so
wellrounded
is
probably
its
biggest
strength
does
not
feel
heavy
in
body
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
warming
not
quite
as
complex
as
your
belgian
belgians
but
dont
hesitate
to
order
this
or
pick
it
up
if
its
at
your
local
beer
store
beer
is
light
and
airy
with
a
nice
mild
breadiness
and
a
dry
finish
no
real
bitterness
just
a
nice
little
tripel
id
have
it
again
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
i
like
la
fin
du
monde
a
bit
more
overall
a
nicesweet
and
fruity
tripel
that
is
really
smooth
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
if
i
was
looking
for
this
style
probably
my
least
favorite
unibroue
ive
tried
its
not
that
its
poorly
made
but
that
it
just
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
personally
i
think
its
well
done
and
would
make
a
good
intro
beer
to
belgian
styles
but
just
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
else
i
will
enjoy
the
bottle
but
no
need
to
try
it
again
really
o
a
great
fruity
tripel
with
excellent
yeast
and
a
low
alcohol
to
make
it
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
is
no
la
fin
du
monde
but
its
still
another
great
tripel
by
unibroue
overall
a
pretty
good
tripel
but
nothing
too
different
than
most
of
the
tripels
you
find
eau
benite
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
about
three
fingers
or
so
of
white
foam
rises
up
to
fill
the
glass
before
slowly
creeping
down
head
retention
is
fairly
minimal
though
the
nose
is
chock
full
of
esters
lots
of
pale
fruit
aromas
swimming
around
and
balanced
by
just
a
little
bit
of
clove
the
flavor
profile
is
similarly
unbalanced
the
fruity
esters
are
superb
with
waves
of
apple
peach
apricot
mango
and
a
little
bit
of
pear
all
present
and
vying
for
attention
the
only
problem
is
that
theres
not
much
else
to
the
beer
at
all
as
in
the
nose
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
phenolic
clove
presence
but
its
very
much
buried
in
the
background
the
body
is
just
a
hair
too
chewy
for
my
taste
but
its
a
close
thing
the
carbonation
on
the
other
hand
is
flawless
its
very
lively
lending
the
beer
some
levity
and
excitement
eau
benite
is
a
tasty
beer
its
just
not
complex
enough
to
hang
with
the
best
tripels
then
again
given
that
unibroue
also
makes
la
fin
du
monde
it
was
going
to
be
hard
for
eau
benite
to
live
up
to
the
inevitable
comparisons
o
solid
beer
and
the
sweetness
makes
this
a
very
good
cocktail
beer
or
cordial
very
easy
to
convert
noncraft
drinkers
to
try
this
750
ml
bottle
into
chalice

this

fantastic

and
extremely
easy
to
drink
kind
of
like
a
smaller
la
fin

just
outstanding
unibroues
yeast
and
its
rendering
has
always
been
very
tasty
to
me
and
it
makes
it
hard
to
not
like
any
of
their
core
offerings
but
this
tripel
could
be
more
ill
stick
to
la
fin
not
a
loss
not
having
this
widely
available
stateside
overall
a
good
but
not
excellent
tripel
o
the
classic
tripel
yeast
profile
is
full
and
supported
by
the
unibroue
house
yeast
character
very
nicely
it
is
slightly
dry
but
not
overly
dry
with
a
good
sweet
perception
to
keep
it
easy
drinkable
overall
this
feels
like
a
flattened
subdued
cola
more
than
anything
kind
of
disappointing
since
i
really
like
la
fin
du
monde
overall
a
good
cross
btween
a
tripel
a
belgian
pale
overall
nice
light
version
of
a
tripel
the
7
7
abv
is
very
drinkable
another
very
good
beer
from
a
very
good
brewery
definitely
a
great
beer
to
drink
the
flavors
all
went
well
together
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
wspwcially
on
a
warm
summer
day
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
best
buy
82313
this
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellowish
color
with
a
decent
foamy
bubbly
white
head
which
quickly
fizzes
away
the
smells
are
of
belgian
yeast
esters
fruits
spices
malts
the
feel
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
little
fruit
some
malts
a
little
dryness
on
the
way
down
along
with
a
tad
hop
bite
o
overall
is
a
complex
beer
which
balances
the
yeasty
and
sweet
tastes
with
good
levels
of
carbonation
and
a
smooth
finish
very
drinkable
for
a
light
tripel
this
is
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
doesnt
hit
the
notes
i
want
in
a
tripel
its
much
more
of
an
imperial
wheat
or
lightlyspiced
witbier
in
character
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
yellow
amber
massive
fine
head
and
lacing
active
carbonation
looks
nice
aroma
of
wheat
citrus
fruit
bananas
and
belgian
spicing
lots
of
complex
sweet
light
fruit
flavors
wheat
and
belgian
spicing
taste
tapers
off
very
quickly
leaving
a
bit
of
light
fruit
clove
butterscotch
and
light
hops
aftertaste
medium
bodied
and
spicy
from
carbonation
and
clove
interesting
and
different
flavor
is
somewhat
subdued
but
pleasant
and
refreshing
this
is
what
id
expect
a
mixture
of
a
hefeweizen
and
belgian
tripel
would
taste
like
quite
different
from
fin
du
monde
and
one
i
will
return
to
in
the
future
86
overall
another
job
well
done
by
unibroue
i
quite
enjoy
the
fluffy
mouthfeel
and
floral
flavours
definitely
worth
picking
up
the
winter
mix
pack
that
includes
this
brew
picked
this
up
in
a
two
pack
of
bombers
from
unibroue
pours
a
nice
light
orange
color
with
a
huge
head
it
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
down
the
sides
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
has
some
floral
characteristics
to
it
the
taste
starts
light
and
with
some
bitterness
but
rounds
out
to
a
nice
fruity
flavor
and
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
this
is
a
great
beer
and
as
a
bottle
conditioned
limited
release
something
i
would
pick
up
again
if
i
ever
saw
it
thanks
again
daftcaskbc
for
another
nice
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
wish
i
could
pick
up
six
packs
or
750mls
of
just
eau
benite
maybe
most
comparable
to
don
de
dieu
but
both
more
drinkable
and
refreshing
though
not
as
tasty
or
complex
overall
i
would
love
to
have
this
in
the
fridge
all
through
the
summer
looks
like
i
might
be
forced
to
buy
a
bunch
of
trois
pistoles
maudite
and
blonde
de
chambly
as
well
tagging
along
in
the
mixed
12
pack
o
la
fin
du
mondes
little
brother
eau
benite
is
just
a
little
more
mellow
with
wheatier
characteristics
and
more
subdued
spicing
nice
notes
of
pear
apple
and
banana
jd
conclusion
i
am
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
was
expecting
to
moderately
enjoy
it
but
it
is
actually
the
best
tripel
i
have
ever
had
my
new
gold
standard
for
this
style
o
yes
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
o
a
little
more
malty
than
la
fin
du
monde
this
tripel
by
unibroue
is
also
extremely
drinkable
and
delicious
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
with
that
said
not
really
up
to
the
quality
i
normally
associate
with
unibroue
not
a
total
loss
as
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
maudite
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
i
have
a
little
issue
with
the
mouthfeel
as
it
starts
out
with
a
nicely
carbonated
medium
body
but
it
seems
to
thin
out
as
it
moves
through
your
mouth
becoming
vaporous
like
a
sake
very
odd
and
distracting
but
the
flavors
are
the
star
here
and
make
this
a
worthwhile
endeavor
in
experience
it
sits
somewhere
between
orval
and
duvel
o
i
love
this
beer
its
delicious
my
biggest
gripe
with
it
is
that
its
only
available
in
gift
sets
seek
it
out
for
sure
d
probably
my
favorite
tripel
so
far
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
nice
drinkable
flavor
with
a
funky
fruit
kick
and
reasonable
abv
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
without
having
to
think
twice
this
is
a
very
solid
well
crafted
beer
and
im
pretty
sure
that
were
i
to
try
it
blind
i
would
think
for
all
the
world
that
this
beer
came
from
belgium
nothing
is
out
preportion
in
this
beer
and
this
is
certainly
something
i
could
see
myself
ordering
again
o
i
wish
it
were
better
its
passable
but
the
intense
smooth
malts
destroy
that
tartness
i
love
to
get
from
the
fruits
of
a
tripel
give
it
a
try
but
dont
expect
to
ascend
to
heaven
o
overall
a
nice
smooth
tripel
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
still
a
solid
beer
especially
for
the
price
another
nice
pleasant
drinker
from
unibroue
opinion
this
is
an
alright
beer
i
really
dont
care
for
how
the
yeast
stands
out
like
it
does
it
almost
seems
like
it
wasnt
finished
fermenting
but
the
attenuation
says
otherwise
perhaps
this
one
is
just
to
small
of
a
beer
for
their
house
yeast
or
something
i
mean
this
is
a
good
beer
from
just
about
any
other
brewery
but
unibroue
makes
some
exceptional
beers
and
this
one
is
not
quite
up
to
that
standard
because
it
isnt
very
clean
in
the
finish
i
would
prefer
to
stick
to
their
la
fin
du
monde
or
something
than
revisit
this
one
again
hazy
pale
orange
color
with
a
very
nice
head
on
top
decent
head
seems
to
want
to
remain
yeasty
and
spicy
aroma
mildly
phenolic
earthy
as
well
very
crisp
and
citrusy
flavor
wise
peppery
spice
to
it
mild
grapefruit
very
sharp
and
effervescent
mouthfeelquite
lively
mild
sticky
sweetness
in
the
finish
nice
enjoyable
tripel
all
in
eau
benite
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
near
perfect
two
finger
off
white
head
good
lacing
and
carbonation
on
this
beer
the
appearance
is
very
murkyhazy
and
impossible
to
see
through
despite
its
relative
light
color
the
nose
is
pleasant
and
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
style
i
get
lemon
peel
clove
malt
and
pepper
as
well
as
some
light
fruit
maybe
a
little
orange
in
there
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
nose
profile
the
pepper
and
spices
come
out
slightly
more
than
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
also
bigger
and
a
little
bolder
than
the
nose
not
quite
as
complexsmooth
as
the
best
tripels
but
still
solid
feel
is
medium
w
a
nice
citrushop
bite
on
the
back
end
good
carbonation
on
the
feel
as
well
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
tripel
id
have
this
again
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
unibroue
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
more
than
la
fin
du
monde
cheers
overall
ok
beer
i
think
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
exciting
from
the
caged
corked
750
ml
bottle
stamped
082313
sampled
on
december
10
2011
it
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
full
fluffy
head
that
simmers
down
as
well
as
a
nice
carbonation
stream
heading
up
the
center
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
alive
with
sensations
including
yeast
clove
corn
belgian
sugars
and
a
tiny
hop
hit
the
body
is
of
medium
texture
it
is
an
exquisite
tripel
with
its
bittersweet
taste
and
spicy
afterglow
that
also
tingles
the
tongue
with
a
sour
hoppy
finale
i
would
probably
buy
this
more
often
if
it
was
available
by
itself
instead
of
part
of
a
gift
pack
d
i
found
this
to
be
an
extremely
pleasing
experience
and
a
very
well
crafted
beer
it
stands
up
against
other
offerings
from
unibroue
fabulously
and
adds
a
strong
contender
to
their
lineup
this
is
kind
of
a
waterier
fin
du
mond
but
i
guess
i
shouldve
expected
that
its
still
darn
good
sort
of
a
lighterweight
younger
brother
with
a
similar
flavor
profile
every
bit
as
good
as
la
fin
du
monde
excellent
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
individually
from
the
gift
pack
though
i
cant
complain
about
having
to
buy
maudite
as
well
highly
recommended
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
earthy
spicy
and
sweet
flavors
subtle
dry
grassy
presence
up
front
countered
by
some
zesty
pepper
and
coriander
this
is
followed
by
a
prominent
estery
yeast
character
that
gives
off
hints
of
bread
and
sweet
light
fruit
hints
of
orange
tangerine
and
apple
are
followed
by
a
nice
alcohol
presence
but
the
abv
is
well
masked
without
much
heat
well
balanced
with
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
and
subtle
booze
to
counter
the
earthyspicy
notes
very
refreshing
and
deceptively
drinkable
i
was
overly
excited
when
i
saw
this
in
the
new
mixer
pack
and
even
being
a
pretty
good
brew
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
high
expectations
that
being
said
the
mixed
pack
has
some
of
the
best
quality
bang
for
your
buck
in
the
province
o
not
a
top
notch
tripel
but
it
is
a
tasty
beer
with
that
unexplainable
but
unmistakeable
unibroue
character
worth
a
try
this
stuff
goes
down
easy
really
easy
light
tripel
yeah
i
guess
that
descriptor
fits
but
it
has
just
as
much
in
common
with
duvel
i
wish
i
didnt
have
to
buy
this
in
a
special
combo
pack
then
again
if
given
the
choice
between
this
and
la
fin
du
monde
i
would
stick
with
the
la
fin
du
monde
o
a
very
goor
beer
and
different
enough
from
the
rest
of
the
lineup
to
stay
relevent
a
refreshing
tripel
nice
to
see
something
new
to
me
anyway
from
unibroue
down
in
these
parts
this
stuff
pours
a
lightly
hazy
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
belgian
yeast
light
white
bread
very
light
cardamom
clove
and
banana
peel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
belgian
yeast
light
flaky
biscuit
coriander
cardamom
black
pepper
clove
banana
and
some
tufts
of
grass
or
there
theres
a
surprising
amount
of
breadiness
in
there
but
it
in
no
way
detracts
from
the
usual
tripelness
not
bad
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
barelylight
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
tripel
not
quite
as
good
as
la
fin
but
more
than
solid
in
and
of
itself
750ml
bottle
purchased
at
fiddlehead
farms
in
dover
pours
a
hazy
yellow
body
with
a
good
two
or
three
inches
of
persistent
head
spice
lemon
orange
with
nut
and
vanilla
notes
comprise
the
aroma
lemon
orange
coriander
anise
clove
pith
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
nut
make
up
the
flavor
medium
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
superdrinkable
which
could
be
dangerous
considering
the
abv
in
a
word
awesome
truly
unique
with
really
no
flaws
to
speak
of
aptly
named
o
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
unibroue
is
so
consistently
good
with
all
their
belgianstyle
ales
o
a
decent
beer
but
one
of
the
weakest
ones
out
of
unibroues
main
lineup
unibroue
being
the
great
brewery
they
are
that
means
its
still
better
than
most
other
north
american
tripels
it
just
doesnt
reach
the
levels
of
complexity
and
crispness
of
la
fin
du
monde
o
a
step
above
la
fin
du
monde
this
beer
is
excellent
overall
a
very
nice
and
smooth
beer
that
will
go
down
dangerously
fast
it
has
a
lot
of
the
taste
found
in
wit
beers
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
fruit
flavours
are
refreshing
no
regrets
on
this
purchase
overall
i
find
this
a
superb
beverage
light
and
crisp
with
wonderful
spicy
fruit
flavors
anyone
not
familiar
with
unibroue
would
do
well
to
start
here
as
the
flavors
in
this
ale
lend
themselves
better
to
the
average
palate
than
some
of
the
brewerys
darker
fares
pour
is
murky
golden
with
a
solid
formed
head
of
white
about
a
finger
and
a
half
nose
is
complex
esters
from
wheat
barley
and
belgian
sugar
first
time
ive
had
a
triple
with
notes
of
marzipan
honey
comb
orangepeel
and
candied
pineapple
nice
smooth
feel
a
bit
a
tingle
more
bright
than
a
hef
would
be
but
still
as
easy
to
drink
has
longevity
as
well
doesnt
seem
to
lose
much
while
sitting
around
d
this
may
not
be
an
incredibly
high
abv
beer
but
it
has
a
warming
character
that
still
leaves
room
for
a
quite
fresh
overall
feel
surely
a
pleasant
drink
i
cant
get
unibroue
beers
very
easily
in
the
uk
but
ill
certainly
buy
any
i
see
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
taste
which
came
through
over
a
curiously
dull
nose
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
nose
was
offensive
but
rather
that
is
was
bright
with
ripe
fruits
and
malty
elements
not
otherwise
common
in
a
tripel
while
you
could
certainly
tell
that
this
was
brewed
within
the
style
the
outlying
components
like
the
aroma
inclusions
and
the
hugely
yeasty
sediment
give
this
brew
an
interesting
twist
overall
its
held
up
well
after
3
years
better
than
the
1837
too
bad
its
discontinued
the
color
is
fairly
turbid
suggesting
the
presence
of
large
wheat
which
is
strange
for
a
triple
the
nose
is
a
little
weak
when
it
receives
a
light
but
fruity
mouth
also
light
with
a
low
alcohol
beverage
which
allows
to
drink
like
whey
it
collects
a
little
spiciness
but
it
was
his
soft
side
even
grainy
as
some
wheat
beers
emerges
with
hints
of
exotic
fruits
with
the
addition
of
a
slight
spicy
bitterness
very
strange
for
a
triple
because
both
nearly
as
tasty
and
as
bitter
as
the
standards
of
the
genre
with
the
advantage
of
being
easy
to
drink
d
pretty
drinkable
for
7
7
though
not
quite
like
some
of
their
other
offerings
la
fin
du
monde
comes
to
mind
wouldnt
mind
this
again
as
it
is
an
interesting
tripel
an
average
tripel
from
unibroue
it
may
be
rare
but
if
you
want
a
canadian
tripel
stick
to
la
find
du
monde
d
this
has
held
up
reasonably
well
i
got
it
around
christmas
of
2008
and
the
aroma
has
developed
a
nice
port
wine
oxidation
character
unfortunately
the
taste
has
smoothed
out
and
lacks
depth
and
richness
of
flavor
lower
in
alcohol
than
fin
du
monde
and
sufficiently
different
that
it
should
be
available
outside
la
belle
province
overall
a
good
beer
from
a
good
company
would
have
again
but
i
would
like
it
to
be
more
complex
drinkability
fits
the
style
unique
enough
complex
enough
virtually
unnoticeable
alcohol
a
bit
more
complexity
would
earn
it
a
considerably
higher
score
the
beer
pours
orange
color
with
some
yellow
notes
a
lot
of
sediments
in
the
beers
floats
quite
huge
piece
too
the
head
is
very
thin
i
see
carbonation
but
no
head
the
smell
is
principally
yeast
fruits
citrus
orange
with
light
notes
of
spice
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
medium
body
and
the
beer
is
feels
round
in
the
mouth
at
the
end
it
taste
a
little
too
much
like
syrup
did
i
taste
some
cloves
maybe
overall
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
and
interesting
drinking
really
enjoyed
the
layers
that
were
presented
thanks
to
papat444
for
so
generously
sharing
this
with
me
through
canbif
thanks
to
zorprime
for
the
bottle
now
im
almost
through
the
canadian
top
25
note
buy
this
again
next
time
we
have
curried
chicken
wcoconut
milk
and
apples
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
golden
hue
with
a
number
of
fingers
of
thin
foamy
white
head
which
leaves
a
very
thin
coating
of
lace
around
the
glass
it
smells
of
sweet
and
acidic
fruit
apples
white
grapes
and
mild
yeast
the
taste
is
honey
raisins
apples
caramel
malt
cloves
and
a
bit
of
floral
yeast
the
carbonation
is
fairly
moderate
for
unibroue
the
body
creamy
and
crisp
and
it
finishes
dry
and
fruity
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
rendering
this
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
taste
wise
the
eau
bénite
continues
the
fruity
theme
from
the
nose
sweetened
with
honey
and
gingery
spiciness
this
beer
put
me
in
mind
of
the
la
goudale
although
with
a
fuller
body
and
a
smooth
softness
in
the
throat
buy
it
if
and
while
you
still
can
unibroue
should
bring
it
back
d
very
nice
axample
very
drinkable
no
hint
of
the
abv
but
too
bad
it
has
not
been
made
in
years
the
taste
was
a
warming
well
balanced
complex
brew
lots
of
flavours
going
on
including
banana
and
raisin
nice
carbonation
very
drinkable
another
well
crafted
brew
from
unibroue
pours
a
murky
orangish
yellow
soft
thick
head
crowns
the
eau
benite
chalice
a
delicate
film
of
lace
is
present
as
the
beer
goes
down
aroma
of
spicy
esters
figs
and
sugar
flavor
is
a
crisp
strong
hit
of
malt
spice
clove
and
cinnamon
and
fruity
figs
passionfruit
watermelon
esters
also
present
was
the
signature
unibroue
yeast
strain
ester
profile
one
i
like
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
refreshing
brews
ive
ever
had
not
too
overwhelming
and
continues
to
be
very
inviting
all
the
way
to
the
end
d
a
bit
too
abrasive
in
the
carbonation
some
nice
flavours
but
i
feel
duvel
beats
it
with
its
easier
on
the
stomach
carbonation
i
felt
very
bloated
and
uncomfortable
after
1
bottle
here
however
taste
and
smell
was
impressive
making
this
a
nice
example
d
another
triumph
from
unibroue
nice
and
complex
and
highly
drinkable
given
its
7
7
abv
relatively
low
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
i
dont
know
if
i
would
classify
this
one
as
a
triple
like
they
do
nevertheless
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
again
pas
trop
pétillante
pas

très
agréable
my
review
is
that
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
of
this
do
so
its
quite
enjoyable
tastes
great
and
is
one
of
unibroues
best
offerings
i
wish
they
werent
discontinuing
it
because
well
the
more
unibroue
styles
out
there
the
better
if
you
cant
get
it
enjoy
a
la
fin
du
monde
or
trois
pistoles
both
of
those
are
just
as
good
if
not
better
d
another
nice
beer
from
unibroue
not
my
number
one
pick
but
more
drinkable

my

d
relatively

for

couldve
used
a
bit
more
flavor
but
rather
refreshing
look
forward
to
another
to
try
the
fantastic
brews
from
unibroue
i
know
there
must
be
some
difference
not
discernable
by
someone
of
my
meager
abilities
but
as
a
first
approximation
this
is
rebottled
fin
du
monde
and
its
good
drinkability
excellent
flavor
and
really
pampers
the
palate
a
fine
rendition
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
unibroue
and
that
devil
in
the
bathtub
on
the
label
needs
a
haircut
badly
drinkability
is
good
balanced
and
enjoyable
thanks
to
fellow
ba
hardtarget
for
generously
sharing
this
example
overall
impression
very
enjoyable
if
you
are
a
unibroue
fan
as
i
am
you
should
enjoy
this
i
need
to
try
to
get
another
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
la
fin
to
tease
out
the
differences
d
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
flavourful
and
strong
enough
to
sip
limited
a
little
by
high
alcohol
that
goes
right
to
your
head
wish
more
stores
stocked
this
one
as
i
prefer
it
to
many
easier
to
find
beers
from
unibroue
good
to
see
the
unibroue
classics
holding
up
despite
the
outside
ownership
this
beer
is
wellplaced
in
the
strong
pale
ale
category
and
nicely
quaffable

though
it
isnt
a
standout
d
very
good
d
for
a
strong
ale
this
one
is
fairly
light
qualifies
as
an
easydrinking
mild
flavoured
belgian
and
may
be
more
accessible
than
one
of
the
heavier
unibroue
ales
goes
down
easy
and
really
packs
some
kick
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
large
head
that
dissipates
just
a
shade
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
smell
is
of
spices
and
light
fruits
like
melon
and
banana
with
cloves
and
vanilla
showing
up
and
a
noticable
alcoholic
tone
to
the
whole
aroma
taste
is
malty
with
wheat
and
grains
present
along
with
a
light
fruitiness
cloves
and
a
touch
of
yeast
mouthfeel
is
smooth
well
carbonated
and
warming
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
an
interesting
offering
from
unibroue
and
much
more
pleasant
than
most
other
holy
water
but
not
quite
as
good
as
this
brewerys
best
beers
age
has
done
well
for
this
beer
flavors
seem
fairly
mellow
while
the
aroma
is
just
as
tantilizing
as
one
could
hope
for
quite
beautiful
light
golden
color
smell
is
all
banana
with
some
other
tropical
fruit
like
papaya
or
guava
intensely
peppery
flavor
alos
with
notes
of
coriander
and
an
underlying
tropical
fruit
sweetness
but
with
a
beautiful
drying
finish
quite
nice
like
a
spicier
double
hefeweizen
almost
reminds
me
of
duvel
in
more
than
one
way
would
certainly
buy
this
if
available
in
the
us
and
was
quite
happy
to
pay
only
5
50
cdn
for
this
big
bottle
overall
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
recommended
no
complaints
here
but
no
rave
review
either
a
solid
beer
and
perhaps
good
for
people
just
learning
about
the
belgian
brews
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
it
doesnt
break
my
heart
that
this
particular
beer
from
unibroue
is
not
available
locally
a
good
beer
but
not
very
pronounced
in
any
kind
of
way
it
is
just
too
middle
of
the
road
for
me
i
always
seem
to
stumble
across
these
obscure
unibroue
offerings
seeing
as
this
isnt
sent
my
way
it
was
nice
to
be
able
to
try
this
at
a
belgian
beer
tasting
over
the
weekend
yeasty
perfumey
aroma
with
hints
of
sweet
malts
herbs
vanilla
fruits
and
apples
notes
of
caramel
and
fruits
especially
apple
dry
with
a
nice
creamy
body
this
beer
is
quite
good
i
really
like
how
it
has
a
light
easy
drinking
yet
still
rich
character
to
it
it
has
lots
of
elements
of
a
perfect
tripel
something
seems
to
be
missing
here
in
the
end
though
it
seems
to
be
missing
a
little
bit
of
richness
and
complexity
that
the
best
examples
have
it
is
quite
enjoyable
though
and
i
certainly
recommend
it
not
a
session
beer
designed
for
sitting
in
front
of
the
fireplace
scratching
your
pups
ears
a
clean
golden
yellow
beer
lots
of
cabonation
has
a
small
white
head
there
a
slight
sweetness
to
the
aroma
at
first
with
peaches
dried
fruit
and
candy
in
the
background
there
is
a
spicey
hop
note
wrapped
around
an
alcohol
backbone
the
taste
starts
with
a
light
sweet
malt
with
some
prickly
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
the
spicey
hop
note
in
the
finish
before
the
alcohol
kicks
in
drinkability
why
do
i
always
only
get
one
of
each
beer
when
i
know
i
can
get
it
here
very
good
beer
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
is
a
lighter
tasting
offering
from
unibroue
almost
saisonlike
in
colour
and
fruit
notes
the
finish
is
soft
with
metallic
overtones
however
having
had
this
beer
many
times
the
metallic
notes
are
likely
to
evaporate
in
34
sips
i
like
this
beer
with
lighter
fare
as
it
does
not
have
the
huge
profile
of
maudite
fin
de
monde
or
trois
pistolles
hazy
golden
colour
topped
by
a
fluffy
white
head
nice
lacing
spicy
aroma
with
plenty
of
fruit
partly
banana
and
some
sweet
malt
fruity
flavour
laced
with
spice
a
bit
peppery
toward
the
end
and
it
finishes
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
creamy
texture
with
generous
carbonation
that
makes
it
a
bit
airy
a
fine
beer
definitely
worth
trying
decent
overall
worth
drinking
cloudy
and
dark
gold
in
colour
lots
of
carbonation
aromas
are
of
yeast
various
spices
and
banana
flavors
are
fairly
sweet
like
a
hefeweizen
but
dry
up
with
a
nice
peppery
finish
this
one
tastes
more
like
a
supedup
hefeweizen
than
a
tripel
solid
and
quite
drinkable
but
unspectacular
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
blonde
big
head
forms
then
goes
laces
well
on
the
glass
smells
sweet
spices
very
malty
some
yeasty
bread
the
taste
is
sweet
substantial
malt
some
spice
in
the
middle
then
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
good
beer
but
the
sameness
of
unibroue
has
its
limits
clear
light
gold
with
a
big
pretty
white
head
that
lasts
a
while
aroma
of
corn
plastic
and
alcohol
but
nothing
in
large
amounts
the
flavor
is
also
surprisingly
subtle
for
such
a
strong
beer
a
rotten
corn
flavor
is
accompanied
by
grain
husk
medicinal
sting
and
higher
alcohols
eww
benite
is
more
like
it
starts
slick
gives
the
tongue
a
little
bite
and
then
takes
off
belgian
malt
liquor
not
good
great
summer
unibroue
in
the
vein
of
their
blanche
wish
it
was
us
released
and
available
like
golden
monkey
certainly
on
par
with
it
an
interesting
brew
quite
drinkable
that
could
without
a
doubt
benefit
from
a
better
head
retention
pours
a
cloudy
golden
peach
body
with
a
fluffy
white
head
great
retention
unmistakable
aroma
of
unibroue
yeast
spicey
and
fruity
nose
taste
of
honey
lots
of
rich
and
complex
malty
flavours
and
fruits
moderate
bitterness
alcoholic
and
warming
always
a
pleasure
drinking
unibrou
e
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
nice
1
fizzy
head
with
good
retention
the
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
slightly
spicy
the
taste
was
very
sweet
malty
and
spicy
but
without
the
huge
punch
that
other
beers
can
bring
you
this
beer
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
nice
soft
finish
to
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
strong
yet
doesnt
carry
the
heavyweight
punch
of
some
its
siblings
poured
a
cloudy
pale
straw
colour
with
a
tiny
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
faint
spicy
with
a
little
citrus
the
taste
had
a
strong
sharp
citrus
bite
and
was
quite
acidic
this
would
do
well
paired
with
spicy
foods
had
a
tangy
mouthfeel
but
very
drinkable
considering
the
realatively
high
abv
a
very
good
summer
quaffer
after
having
a
great
trois
pistolets
i
was
excited
to
open
up
another
one
from
unibroue
have
to
say
that
i
was
disappointed
an
oxidised
botlefermentation
heavy
malted
haynose
came
up
and
wasnt
too
preased
with
it
looking
at
its
shape
of
the
beer
i
noticed
a
big
cloud
in
the
botle
should
i
revieuw
this
one
is
it
hounest
these
thoughts
were
realy
in
my
mind
when
i
drank
this
beer
sip
by
sip
unimpressed
of
what
i
drank
could
this
be
infected
dont
know
either
but
seeing
a
best
before
231206
so
almost
2
years
to
go
so
i
wrote
this
report
cause
i
want
to
say
something
can
go
wrong
with
your
beer
on
the
way
to
youre
store
or
was
it
the
brewer
itself
anyway
cant
imagine
anyone
liking
this
one
the
way
i
got
it
over
here
sorry
see
that
average
from
ba
is
quiet
high
but
cant
believe
its
the
beer
i
drank
always
believe
in
ba
seeing
that
i
gave
the
trois
pistolets
today
4
15
and
avarage
is
4
25
as
soon
as
i
can
get
one
of
a
another
date
i
will
buy
it
again
and
edit
my
review
but
till
then
this
one
is
there
it
poured
cloudy
and
golden
with
very
little
head
to
it
the
nose
is
intriguing
with
a
potent
spiciness
aspect
on
first
contact
there
is
a
very
noticable
peppery
flavor
however
it
is
equally
well
balanced
you
also
get
a
quick
passing
of
banana
notes
the
finish
is
reminiscent
to
an
old
cask
very
comparable
to
its
belgian
counterparts
this
is
one
of
those
while
not
quite
a
session
beer
is
very
warming
in
the
belly
its
good
stuff
12
ounce
bottle
no
best
before
dating
to
be
found
pours
a
dark
chill
hazed
shade
of
dark
honey
not
much
of
a
white
head
which
quickly
disappeared
nose
of
tropical
fruit
yeast
fairly
heavy
bodied
deeply
flavorful
brew
notes
of
nutty
yeastyness
vanilla
flowers
and
some
spice
a
wiff
of
bittersweetness
in
the
finish
tasty
complex
brew
cant
go
too
wrong
with
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
strong
head
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
sweet
some
fruits
alcohol
and
grains
sweetness
in
the
flavor
that
is
well
balanced
and
ends
with
a
nice
bitterness
very
well
made
beer
ill
enjoy
this
one
again
assuming
i
can
find
it
again
woo
hoo
thie
one
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
2
fingers
of
head
the
nose
is
really
nice
its
fruity
almost
a
bit
of
a
gueze
sourness
in
there
too
this
is
drawing
me
into
trying
it
the
flavors
are
kind
of
subdued
in
this
one
there
is
a
nice
mellow
creamy
malt
but
the
aftertaste
is
what
carries
this
beer
in
my
mind
its
sweet
and
a
bit
of
a
fruit
flavor
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
thick
and
nice
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
one
the
light
mellow
flavor
and
mouthfeel
keep
this
one
easy
to
drink
i
think
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
in
a
heartbeat
a
huge
thanks
to
clvand0
for
bringing
this
beauty
over
to
be
shared
well
it
appears
sleeman
hasnt
messed
around
with
unibroues
quality
as
this
is
a
delicious
beer
pours
an
auburnhoney
colour
with
a
massive
white
head
that
looks
like
a
cloud
from
heaven
sticky
lace
coats
the
glass
like
white
curtains
smells
sweet
with
tropical
fruits
grains
malts
alcohol
and
dark
fruitsraisins
figs
dates
tastes
delicious
a
satisfying
sweetness
that
isnt
cloying
or
overpowering
the
malts
create
a
platform
for
the
fruit
sweetness
still
the
aftertaste
has
a
bit
of
a
tangy
bitterness
orange
peels
or
a
hop
i
cant
quite
recognise
who
cares
as
long
as
it
is
good
and
this
is
beyong
a
good
beer
its
a
great
beer
worthy
of
the
unibroue
brewery
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
slick
and
crisp
for
a
high
alcohol
brew
this
is
highly
drinkable
in
fact
i
dont
think
the
drinkability
can
be
improved
so
i
must
give
it
a
five
pint
bottle
from
the
variety
12
pack
poured
a
hazy
cloudy
straw
color
1
finger
frothy
cap
that
goes
to
a
ring
sweet

phenols
and
some
musty
raisin
in
the
nose
medium
carbonation
stays
lively
in
the
glass
starts
very
peppery
frpm
the
carbonation
malts
have
a
raisin
bread
effect
finishes
up
faster
than
other
strong
ubrews
alcohol
poorly
hidden
in
the
finish
it
dominates
the
tongue
fruity
honey
tones
and
a
warm
peppery
boozyness
call
me
nutz
but
there
ar
too
many
ubrews
whith
the
same
signature
tates
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
unibroue
its
pours
hazy
gold
with
just
a
hint
of
peach
peach
is
also
noticeable
in
the
smell
and
taste
along
with
the
trademark
unibroue
yeast
and
some
candi
sugar
it
seems
surprisingly
dry
i
finsished
the
750
but
didnt
feel
compelled
to
run
off
to
the
shop
to
pick
up
another
any
time
soon
pours
a
bright
golden
color
slight
haziness
nice
fluffy
head
on
this
bad
boy
smells
of
sweet
fruitiness
lemon
bananas
and
cherries
tastes
like
an
average
belgianstyle
pale
ale
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
one
it
lacked
a
certain
oomph
it
didnt
taste
very
spicy
clovey
or
phenolic
the
banananess
was
a
bit
too
much
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
heavy
also
could
be
a
bit
fizzier
instead
of
heavy
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
a
number
of
similar
beers
from
other
breweries
that
i
prefer
definitely
worth
a
try
though
and
a
great
buy
at
only
6
per
bottle
i
had
to
pick
this
up
in
b
c
because
it
is
no
longer
sold
in
alberta
for
some
reason
poured
from
a
brown
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
i
like
the
little
poem
on
the
back
label
both
in
english
and
french
although
i
prefer
the
french
version
better
served
in
a
glass
chalice
the
head
is
immense
on
the
initial
pour
a
massive
creamy
cloudlike
expanse
capping
a
hazed
deep
golden
body
with
intense
carbonation
the
bouquet
is
light
and
effervescent
very
uplifting
to
inhale
light
grains
honey
vanilla
with
a
bit
of
a
tropical
papayalike
character
and
some
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
also
very
light
and
effervescent
for
an
ale
of
7
7
abv
very
velvety
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
well
named
ale
mild
spice
on
the
first
sip
that
warms
your
insides
banana
clove
and
some
vanilla
fruit
esters
come
out
in
the
middle
like
candied
papaya
and
banana
while
the
finish
is
rather
low
key
as
all
these
flavours
blend
into
one
remarkable
balance
its
been
years
and
years
since
ive
tried
this
stuff
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
so
good
a
shame
that
i
cant
find
it
around
these
parts
very
easily
a
triumph
of
the
brewing
alchemy
that
unibroue
can
perform
drinkability
if
i
see
this
on
tap
ill
have
to
try
it
but
otherwise
will
likely
not
seek
it
out
tart
at
first
but
mellows
mid
sip
has
a
very
doughy
flavor
to
it
with
a
faint
fruity
finish
alcohol
is
masked
entirely
this
could
be
dangerous
stuff
to
drink
more
than
one
of
this
gets
even
better
as
you
move
towards
midbottle
an
extremely
good
beer
unibroue
has
done
it
again
thin
harsh
mouthfeel
although
the
alcohol
is
not
apparent
this
is
too
dry
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
white
grapes
and
lemon
essence
the
taste
is
malty
as
well
with
pear
and
apple
coming
through
a
touch
of
tartness
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
light
for
the
style
the
drinkability
fairs
well
too
for
a
7
7
brew
quite
a
quaffable
brew
from
unibroue
2
29
12
oz
it
poured
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
smell
is
fruity
just
right
in
my
opinion
it
tastes
like
the
smell
with
a
kind
of
tropical
fruit
flavor
mouthfeel
was
good
but
maybe
a
little
too
carbonated
but
the
alcohol
is
not
very
apparent
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
is
one
my
favorites
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
i
like
other
unibroue
offerings
a
little
more
this
poured
nearly
flat
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
its
color
was
a
foggy
gold
reminiscent
of
apple
cider
the
aroma
of
this
socalled
holy
water
was
rather
estery
and
winelike
mouthfeel
was
crisp
thin
and
sharp
the
somewhat
watered
down
seltzery
taste
with
hints
of
fruit
and
spices
nutmeg
almost
reminded
me
more
of
a
hard
cider
than
a
beer
an
orange
pour
with
a
big
white
foamy
head
very
lively
lots
of
bubbles
and
such
the
nose
is
mildly
fruity
with
a
good
dose
of
spice
fresh
and
light

a

of
woodiness
the
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
full
while
the
taste
is
malty
with
wheat
notes
the
taste
dries
out
and
leaves
an
earthy
dry
finish
very
solid
and
well
balanced
not
unibroues
best
howvever
this
is
just
one
more
reason
that
unibroue
is
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
le
miracle
dunibroue
indeed
very
silky
on
tongue
easy
drinking
with
food
drinkability
ill
definitely
have
to
snag
another
bottle
of
this
preferably
one
that
is
fresher
the
bottle
i
had
was
still
quite
good
but
i
think
the
head
took
quite
a
hit
a
solid
tripel
even
in
its
faded
glory
i
must
also
note
that
the
label
art
is
cool
i
like
the

the

budget
quite
complex
and
wonderful
to

one
really
can
not
go
wrong
with
a
unibroue
beer
i
got
this
in
a
lovely
outdoor
bar
in
old
montreal
it
pours
a
lovely
pale
gold
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
malt
apple
caramel
the
taste
has
a
bunch
of
fruit
in
it
apple
peach
cantaloupe
along
with
malt
and
cloves
i
found
this
to
have
more
apple
flavor
throughout
than
ephemere
which
had
a
blast
of
apple
in
the
beginning
that
faded
fast
and
this
holy
water
doesnt
have
apple
in
it
a
lovely
creamy
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
the
finish
is
malt

sugar

be
a

merci
unibroue
this
was
one
of
my
scores
from
a
recent
trip
to
nyc
cant
find
this
stuff
on
the
west
coast
i
am
worried
however
as
to
whether
it
survived
the
plane
trip
ok
because
whne
i
poured
it
the
beer
came
out
a
hazy
yellow
with
almost
no
head
at
all
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
quite
fruity
with
a
hint
of
spice
fruit
comes
through
big
in
the
taste
as
well
here
it
struck
me
as
rather
melonlike
with
hints
of
tropical
fruit
overall
this
beer
struck
me
as
a
bit
too
sweet
too
onedimensional
rather
a
disappointment
coming
from
unibroue
pours
a
orangelike
color
wirh
a
pretty
light
headaroma
was
almost
like
apple
cider
with
some
more
tartness
flavor
is
also
applelike
but
also
some
juicy
citruis
notes
a
nice
yeastiness
in
the
background
rounds
this
beer
out
really
well
pretty
tart
and
drinkablewell
done
lots
of
fruit
like
a
tripel
should
have
citrus
fruit
tarty
fruit
sweet
fruit
you
name
it
this
beer
has
it
but
thats
not
all
slight
honey
sweetness
is
in
it
a
hoppyness
swirls
the
mouth
creating
a
happy
feeling
for
me
alcohol
is
strong
in
this
one
esp
at
the
end
became
an
amazing
brew
the
further
i
got
on
it
possibly
because
of
my
intoxication
but
anyways
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
i
like
it
more
each
time
bow
down
to
unibroue
suprisingly
this
is
a
light
orange
colour
beer
a
lot
lighter
then
other
belgian
triple
pourred
a
nice
clear
white
head
that
did
not
disapear
too
quickly
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
taste
very
sweet
very
good
beer
but
not
a
traditional
triple
another
good
beer
from
unibroue
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
would
go
great
with
pasta
i
found
that
i
was
sipping
lightly
so
i
did
not
find
it
as
drinkable
as
other
beers
this
is
a
very
dry
unibroue
its
good
of
course
but
for
me
its
a
little
bland
compared
to
the
others
its
about
as
light
as
7

abv
can
get
originally
sampled

i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
it
has
a
large
white
head
w
tiny
bubbles
that
disapates
quickly
its
a
cloudy
light
golden
color
its
slightly
sweet
w
a
dry
flat
finish
no
alcohol
flavor
nice
but
not
outstanding
carefully
poured
its
a
clear
deep
golden
color
adding
the
yeasty
sediment
clouds
it
but
also
adds
a
softer
character
and
stronger
vanilla
tones
the
offwhite
head
is
creamy
and
displays
good
retention
but
leaves
only
limited
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
offers
an
interesting
yeastiness
that
displays
vanilla
clove
and
soft
fruit
apples
berry
papaya
melon
its
very
fine
natural
carbonation
softly
caresses
the
tongue
and
although
the
body
is
light
its
creaminess
gives
it
the
impression
of
a
fuller
body
vanilla
returns
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
softly
sweet
maltiness
thats
backed
by
gentle
fruit
apple
pear
mild
strawberry
and
a
light
touch
of
alcohol
that
gently
lingers
on
the
palate
following
the
swallow
its
quite
unique
and
very
impressive
in
just
that
ive
never
had
a
beer
similar
to
this
and
although
it
did
take
a
little
bit
of
warming
to
its
become
one
of
my
favorites
well
worth
trying

hazy
dark

by
a

that
readily

of
foam
bready
malt
along
with
wafts
of
must
green
apple
and
lightly
acidic
lime
citrus
dominate
the
somewhat
tame
aroma
with
subtle
notes
of
peppery
alcohol
and
trace
phenol
mild
honeyish
sweetness
is
perceived
at
first
in
flavor
then
is
followed
by
notes
of
underripe
kiwi
and
white
grape
fruitiness
fades
mid
palate
revealing
a
pleasantly
dry
bready
lightly
cracker
like
malt
foundation
which
is
in
turn
supplemented
by
understated
herbal
clove
hints
of
black
licorice
and
candied
green
apple
emerge
late
along
with
mild
nearly
forgotten
hop
bitterness
well
attenuated
and
acceptably
smooth
in
mouthfeel
but
a
hair
thin
finishes
clean
with
mild
agreeable
limeish
acidity
and
hints
of
sweet
bread
a
surprisingly
tame
but
balanced
strong
golden
by
unibroue
highly
reminescent
of
a
belgian
single
in
overall
character
except
with
a
dangerously
hidden
alcohol
content
highly
quaffable
a
bit
too
neutral
in
yeast
derived
character
but
quite
tasty
nonetheless
drinkability
good
this
is
a
welldone
tripel
theres
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
but
nothing
bad
or
out
of
place
either
its
not
one
of
unibroues
best
but
it
is
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
pours
a
cloudy
pale
golen
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
it
has
a
very
fruity
aroma
the
taste
is
fruity
as
well
tastes
like
apricot
and
pineapple
its
a
very
refreshing
and
wonderful
beer
unibroue
somehow
has
a
way
of
amazing
me
even
with
my
extremely
high
expections
i
always
expect
something
great
and
they
always
deliver
swonderful
smarvelous
swhatilike
to
drink
f
although
it
has
warming
characteristics
its
7
7abv
is
lower
than
that
of
many
triples
but
that
alcohol
content
can
sneak
up
on
ya
when
not
looking
its
a
very
drinkable
ale
that
went
well
with
a
series
of
prexmas
dinner
appetizers
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
some
slight
yeasties
in
suspension
and
a
huge
creamy
white
head
that
sinks
some
but
lasts
all
the
way
down
sweet
candy
sugar
aromas
with
some
lighter
fruit
tones
such
as
peach
orange
zest
and
orange
there
are
also
some
very
prevalent
spice
tones
smells
of
pepper
and
clove
are
all
over
the
brew
huge
sweetness
hits
the
tongue
right
away
before
giving
way
to
some
nice
orange
fruitiness
with
a
trailing
pepper
taste
slightly
herbal
hops
can
be
quietly
detected
in
the
back
of
the
brew
as
it
progresses
towards
its
spicy
slightly
alcoholic
finish
than
lingers
nicely
on
the
tongue
leaving
a
craving
for
more
sweet
creamy
silk
is
all
over
my
tongue
as
i
drink
this
brew
light
but
at
the
same
time
not
absolutely
excellent
brew
but
would
i
expect
anything
less
from
this
amazing
brewery
looks
yellow
and
extreamly
clear
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
and
a
white

aroma

some

the
original

well
balenced

the
finish

the

a
solid
unibroue
product
a
very
drinkable
tripel
i
like
it
i
liked
this
beer
citrusy
and
slightly
sweet
but
not
overbearingly
so
the
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
goldenorangey
opaque
brew
not
as
spicy
as
la
fin
du
monde
nor
as
sweet
as
don
du

an
easy
drinking
brew
i
had
it
in
the
750ml
corked
bottle
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
light
orange
with
unibroues
trademark
white
massive
head
the
head
fades
rather
quickly
the
smell
again
from
unibroue
is
fruity
and
yeasty
this
one
has
a
strong
fuit
and
alcohol
taste
medium
body
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
the
alchohol
is
definitely
warming
i
could

i
think
ill
stick
to
the
evil
brews
time
to
pick
up
a
big
bottle
of
duvel
notes
very
rich
with
many
complex
sweet
alcohol
and
fruity
flavours
it
is
apparent
is
beer
was
sent
from
heaven
i
like
some
of
unibroues
beers
but
some
pf
their
others
have
some
serious
work
to
do
in
my
opinion
some
of
them
are
a
bit
too
cloying
one
dimentional
and
perhaps
a
bit
sticky
like
this
one
excellent
triple
from
unibroue
wheatyeast
overtones

appearance
at
this
point
it
becomes
futile
to
try
to
decide
which
of
their
brews
is
the
best
each
is
unique
and
a
treat
in
its
own
right
try
them
all
and
if
you
are
spoiled
try
them
often
complex

and

1
of

favorite
beers
of
all
time
man
just
not
my
thing
i
heard
great
things
about
the
beer
but
i
just
dont
like
the
taste
ive
got
friends
that
love
it
and
drink
it
all
the
time
not
me
i
will
confess
that
i
like
but
do
not
love
tripels
but
enjoyed
this
offering
from
canada
very
yeasty
and
quite
smooth
for
a
highoctane
brew
a
fantastic
belgian
pale
the
active
effervescence
adds

theres

full

i
havent
been
to

four

like
a

cooked
down
and
chilled
a
beautiful
beer
for

winter
or
christmas
holiday
but
not
so
obvious
it
cant
be
had
all
year
o
thanks
to
you
guysgals
here
on
beer
advocate
i
decided
to
go
for
a
beer
that
i
passed
by
without
taking
a
second
look
every
time
i
was
at
the
liquor
store
im
thankful
that
i
finally
picked
it
up
top
notch
word
class
beer
that
is
easily
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
ive
had
i
love
this
beer
the
bar
that
i
frequent
for
six
packs
usually
carries
la
fin
du
monde
and
910
times
i
pick
up
a
six
pack
i
get
one
of
these
if
youve
never
had
one
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
one
its
got
a
smooth
taste
with
hints
of
citrus
and
a
tiny
bit
of
clove
its
light
and
drinkable
but
i
find
it
to
be
heavy
on
the
stomach
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
in
the
whole
wide
world
the
sweet
hints
of
citrus
and
clove
make
this
beer
so
tastyall
year
around
i
ended
up
just
smelling
this
beer
over
and
over
once
it
hit
its
stride
and
opened
up
amazing
just
swirled
it
around
and
stuck
my
nose
in
deep
into
my
snifter
and
teased
my
lips
several
times
without
taking
a
sip
yeah
this
beer
brought
out
the
giddy
junior
high
foreplay
in
me
i
thought
was
long
gone
true
quebecois
flirtatious
romance
bottle
of
la
fin
du
monde
drank
o
deliciously
strong
and
flavorful
a
damn
good
tripel
that
has
smoothed
down
a
bit
with
age
this
might
be
my
favorite
north
american
brew
in
a
belgian
style
i
love
belgian
beer
and
most
attempts
fall
flat
to
me
this
was
outstanding
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
be
canadian
poured
into
snifter
with
a
thick
head
the
color
is
a
gold
with
a
slight
red
to
it
smells
like
wheat
and
apple
on
the
nose
taste
is
smooth
with
some
bitterness
towards
the
end
this
is
an
amazing
beer
one
sip
of
this
and
im
back
in
some
medieval
cloister
with
torches
on
the
stone
walls
and
evensong
through
the
window
a
head
you
have
to
see
to
believe

poured
into
tulip
two
plus
fingers
of
offwhite

slowly
collapses
to

this
beer
was
alright
not
especially
flavorful
or
anything
of
note
i
feel
if
it
was
produced
by
a
less
prestigious
brewery
people
would
rank
it
lower
i
also
am
not
going
to
get
overly
excited
for
high
abv
high
abv
is
fine
but
it
doesnt
make
a
mediocre
beer
good
too
heavy
on

clove
wow
this
is
a
world
class
tasty
brew
after
a
large
crab
dinner
wine
just
couldnt
refresh
fortunately
i
found
this
tripel
at
total
wine
this
afternoon
beautiful
white
foamy
head
spices
that
tease
the
palate
and
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
all
that
and
i
didnt
notice
the
9
abv
a
belgian
triple
thats
brewed
in
quebec
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
great
taste
good
color
and
smell
this
brewery
crafts
some
of
the
best
beers
on
the
planet
however
i
cant
help
thinking
ever
time
i
purchase
drink
some
or
discuss
it
of
my
third
grade
teacher
mrs
dragon
no
kidding
who
left
her

to
grow

unfettered

i
was

ive

malt
flavors
some
how
dry
and
effervescent
yet
with
a
smooth
creamy
finish
all
at
once
great
for
a
toast
nice
to
sip
or
guzzle
with
food
just
watch
out
for
the
9
abv
cause
you
cant
tell
its
there
o
as
close
to
perfection
as
it
gets
bar
none
one
of
the
most
wellstructured
and
wellbalanced
brews
out
there
its
potency
commands
respect
and
when
sipped
slowly
and
contemplated
it
offers
a
most
memorable
and
rewarding
experience
a
mustdrink
for
any
enthusiast
of
belgianstyle
beers
hazy
orange
small
white
head
smell
is
fantastic
belgian
yeast
esters
throwing
out
sweet
banana
aromas
maybe
some
funky
apple
and
a
hint
of
orange
this
tastes
sweet
banana
like
and
just
a
hint
of
booze
highly
carbonated
and
a
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
this
is
an
outstanding
tripel
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
definitely
hides
its
9
alcohol
it
really
is
quite
refreshing
for
a
heavier
beer
almost
like
a
lager
or
pilsner
but
it
has
way
more
flavor
than
most
beers
in
those
categories
one
of
my
favorite
brews
first
time
i
had
it
there
was
a
match
lit
inside
my
cheeks
and
the
parade
had
begun
was
a
great
beer
overall
was
very
smooth
an
had
a
nice
fruity
taste
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
again
o
i
think
this
is
great
it
is
different
from
what
i
would
expect
in
a
triple
being
hazy
and
more
on
the
sweet
side
but
that
by
no
means
takes
away
from
how
great
this
is
it
has
a
great
complex
fruity
belgian
yeast
character
and
is
very
refreshing
i
had
this
first
probably
9
or
so
years
ago
when
i
first
started
getting
into
craft
and
didnt
like
it
then
now
this
has
got
to
be
one
if
not
my
favorite
triples
very
smooth
hard
to
believe
that
it
is
9
abv
nice
fruity
pear
flavour
i
would
buy
again
had
this
in
a
bottle
and
really
enjoyed
it
ive
been
getting
more
into
belgians
lately
and
this
tripel
was
a
strong
representative
of
the
style
great
balance
and
very
well
crafted
its
dangerous
because
its
9
abv
but
you
dont
feel
the
alcohol
so
be
careful
but
do
make
sure
you
try
this
if
you
find
it
anywhere
because
its
well
worth
it
overall
i
liked
the
madelf
my
first
ever
full
belgian
style
beer
better
but
i
can
imagine
why
this
is
rated
higher
it
is
wellmade
and
wellbalanced
i
have
opened
up
a
whole
new
beer
chapter
its
a
belgian
golden
it
has
belgiany
banana
and
clove
stuff
going
on
la
fin
du
monde
is
quebecs
pure
gold
and
metallic

had
this
in
years
and
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
loved
it
its
a
light
orangey
and
the
spice
profile
grew
as
the
beer
warmed
a
little
bit
of
classic
bubblegum
flavor
started
to
come
out
a
bit
too
alongside
of
the
clove
no
traces
of
the
booze
the

the

use
a

and
pour
at
an

slowly
until
about
one
inch
of

is
achieved
then
pour
rest
of
beer
into
glass
after
about
a
minute
or
so
it
has
a
very
distinct
bittersweet
taste
a
nice
example
of
this
style
overall
a
great
beer
but
overly
sweet
for
my
taste
o
like
most
tripels
its
a
little
sweet
for
my
preferences
but
its
quite
good
lot
of
yeast
flavors
in
this
one
a
legit
belgian
inspired
tripel
definitely
worth
trying
atleast
once
overall
amazing

the
first

i
had
that
was

i
havent
had
one
of
these
for
4
or
5
years
its
totally
decent
and
enjoyable
but
wow
is
it
massively
overrated
on
review
sites
lemony

nice

goes
really
well
with
bready
cheesey
food
does
not

what
you
are
eating
and
washes
it
down
nicely
nice
light

finish
is
pleasant
we
get
so
many
bad
beers
from
canada
it
is
nice
to
get
a
truly
exceptional
beer
from
north
of
the
border
nothing
to
pick
apart
here
a
really
solid
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
at
anytime
of
year
this
hits
all
the
notes
of
the
tripel
style
and
strikes
a
chord
with
your
taste
buds
its
classic
and
the
standard
belgian
born
or
not
o
delicious
complex
and
baffling
you
know
its
good
when
it
brings
a
smile
to
your
face
every
time
you
take
a
sip
a
wonderful
beer
and
if
i
did
know
the
world
was
ending
it
might
just
be
the
beer
i
go
out
on
o
great
tripel
so
easy
to
drink
but
be
careful

i
always

how
good
this
is
superb
random
notes
on
this
beer
this
is
my
second
time
having
it
this
is
the
brew
that
introduced
me
to
the
glorious
world
of
unibroue
its
not
my
favortie
from
them
but
more
than
worth
having
im
having
it
now
because
when
i
started
drink
it
it
was
122112
and
i
made
a
pleadge
to
have
it
at
midnight
as
the
name
itself
apparentlly
means
the
end
of
the
world
ultimately
i
used
that
as
an
excuse
to
have
this
agian
final
grade
4
61
a
virtually
flawless
a
la
fin
du
monde
is
one
of
canadas
finest
beers
though
im
not
entirely
sure
it
would
be
my
first
last
beer
choice
if
i
believed
we
were
all
completely
doomed
it
remains
an
unbelievably
great
value
purchase
for
any
tripel
fan
both
in
terms
of
price
point
quality
and
wide
accessibilitydistribution
for
these
reasons
it
is
well
worth
a
purchase
for
anyone
interested
in
the
style
ive
had
this
before
and
ill
probably
have
it
again
and
would
recommend
everyone
else
follow
suit
overall
this
beer
is
unique
in
the
style
and
has
an
unbelievable
amount
of
flavor
very
hard
to
tame
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
belgian
ales
it
is
very
complex
from
start
to
finish
this
beer
is
incredible
make
sure
it
is
not
served
to
cold
the
beer
pours
an
ugly
piss
yellow
with
hints
of
orange
and
with
a
very
soapy
head
on
it
that
fizzles
away
slowly
and
sits
over
the
beer
as
the
color
of
soap
bubbles
the
beers
body
is
cloudy
like
piss
but
allows
a
fair
amount
of
light
through
on
the
nose
this
beer
smells
of
soy
sauce
and
banana
phenol
notes
with
some
very
slight
bubblegum
hints
fruity
soy
sauce
is
really
what
comes
to
mind
when
you
smell
it
though
not
in
an
entirely
bad
way
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
of
creamy
banana
soy
and
some
nice
clovelike
spice
the
beer
really
begins
with
light
soy
notes
that
grow
in
fruitiness
until
they
hit
banana
flavors
and
all
the
while
the
spicy
clove
also
builds
on
the
sides
of
the
flavor
and
leaves
the
aftertaste
to
ring
lightly
of
spice
and
slight
banana
the
middle
of
the
taste
is
really
where
this
beer
shines
with
big
spicy
cream
banana
notes
that
are
quite
pleasant
on
the
taste
buds
on
the
mouth
this
beer
feels
quite
fierce
with
carbonation
though
the
beer
below
it
sits
with
a
nice
medium
body
that
sticks
to
the
tongue
and
leaves
the
mouth
clean
but
with
sticky
saliva
along
the
sides
of
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
nice
tripelstyle
ale
with
some
great
phenolic
notes
and
some
nice
spicy
complexity
a
fitting
beer
to
end
the
world
with
i
suppose
though
it
isnt
my
favorite
in
the
style
still
this
beer
is
worthy
of
a
try
heres
to
the
mayans
overall
easy
top
beer
for
the
style
award
very
fair
prices
for
a
beer
of
this
caliber
o
this
is
the
best
nonbelgian
belgianstyle
ale
that
ive
had
perfect
example
of
a
tripel
and
rivals
the
trappist
breweries
verdict
a
rock
solid
tripel
one
of
the
flag
bearers
of
the
style
personally
i
have
other
favorites
but
this
is
definitely
a
go
to
beer
as
it
is
available
nearly
everywhere
cheers
to
unibroue
for
this
one
definitely
a
success
o
a
world
class
example
if
the
style
the
complexities
of
the
flavors
in
this
brew
are
hard
to
beat
one
worth
revisiting
a
couple
of
times
a
year
to
set
a
benchmark
for
other
tripels
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
all
the
flavors
blend
together
really
nicely
i
could
have
several
of
these
o
great
balanced
flavor
champagne
feel
to
it
great
thing
to
have
when
the
world
ends
very
balanced
flavor
with
good
mouthfeel
a
bit
pricey
but
well
worth
it
o
very
good
tripel
and
couldnt
be
a
better
day
to
drink
it
overall
4
0
a
very
good
tripel
triple
etc
however
i
have
to
state
that
to
my
tastes
it
is
a
bit
too
dry
and
lacking
in
depth
of
flavor
the
middle
especially
should
have
had
more
depth
unibroue
is
a
legend
and
for
good
reason
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
is
not
the
best
beer
they
produce
a
must
try
in
my
book
if
you
are
even
slightly
interested
in
venturing
out
in
the
beer
world
fairly
easy
to
find
and
not
overly
expensive
but
be
careful
as
you
will
not
notice
the
9
alcvol
as
you
are
tasting
this
end
of
the
world
experience
the
taste
is
simple
yes
simple
the
banana
is
present
yeasty
in
the
middle
followed
by
the
clove
but
i
dont
get
a
whole
lot
more
the
label
reads
robust
flavour
but
i
cant
find
it
this
seems
to
be
a
basic
triple
golden
ale
maybe
i
just
dont
get
it
or
the
style
but
this
isnt
something
id
try
again
o
wow
tough
to
pick
between
this
and
karmaliet
either
way
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
beers
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
is
spicy
bananas
cloves
coriander
and
pepper
taste
is
a
sweetand
sour
medley
of
bananas
funky
spices
and
coriander
mouthfeel
is
alive
bubbly
like
champagne
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
you
still
get
a
slight
taste
nothing
overbearing
overall
a
great
tripel
and
another
home
run
from
unibroue
o
this
is
a
great
beer
no
doubt
about
that
it
hits
all
of
the
right
notes
in
terms
of
aroma
and
taste
for
a
tripel
its
especially
impressive
for
the
price
im
not
sure
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
have
a
la
fin
du
monde
but
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
more
often
now
fuller
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
bubbly
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
its
been
years
since
ive
had
this
but
unibroue
really
makes
a
nice
tripel
the
abv
is
right
on
point
but
not
overbearing
and
i
enjoyed
the
balance
of
spice
and
hops
if
confronted
with
la
fin
du
monde
readysetenjoy
a
super
fun
drinking
beer
the
pour
is
sophisticated
and
just
the
correct
beautiful
foam
lingering
head
the
spices
are
correctly
proportioned
somebody
said
grapefruit
maybe
but
absolutely
a
nice
citrus
then
comes
banana
and
a
hint
of
coriander
nothing
overdone
well
balanced
smell
so
intriguing
almost
a
sexy
come
on
unibroue
always
seems
to
hit
it
out
and
this
tripel
certainly
maintains
their
tradition
of
excellence
as
with
all
high
abvs
think
about
it
before
driving
after
a
couple
of
these
but
that
said
enjoy

very
strong

cheers
mcc
othis
is
my
3rd
unibroue
all
3the
are
my
favorite
belgian
style
beers
this
one
is
a
liquid
fruit
cocktail
so
many
different
fruits
attack
the
senses
that
im
sure
i
missed
some
in
my
review
for
a
9
abv
brew
the
alcohol
is
extremely
tame
enhancing
the
flavor
and
leaving
a
somewhat
white
wine
like
flavor
spices
and
sparkling
apple
cider
round
out
this
amazing
brew
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
huge
white
fluffy
head
high
retention
soapysticky
lacing
aroma
includes
lemon
peel
banana
clove
nice
white
pepper
spiciness
taste
includes
all
of
the
same
also
some
candi
sugar
deliciously
wispy
and
certainly
deserving
of
all
of
its
accolades
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
expected
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
i
would
not
hesitate
to
get
another
bottle
as
it
is
delicious
o
this
is
a
very
well
enjoyable
beer
its
not
overly
complex
flavours
are
a
bit
hidden
and
it
is
sweeter
then
bitter
on
the
balance
scale
i
think
its
a
great
introduction
to
a
tripel
overall
unibroue
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
as
almost
every
unibroue
drink
i
have
had
has
exceeded
my
expectations
by
miles
la
fin
du
monde
is
no
different
this
is
one
of
m
favorite
beers
by
them
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
general
its
an
extremely
well
made
triple
ale
on
lees
if
you
took
blue
moon
and
made
it
10x
better
you
would
have
la
fin
du
monde
i
also
enjoy
it
with
slices
of
grapefruit
thats
right
not
oranges
i
drink
this
beer
regularly
and
recommend
it
to
all
beercurious
folk
just
be
careful
that
hidden
9
abv
doesnt
sneak
up
on
you
this
is
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
pouring
it
angled
properly
yields
little
head
sometimes
i
get
a
thick
foamy
white
head
there
are
tons
of
sweet
and
fragrant
aromas
that
im
not
so
good
at
identifying
but
it
is
quite
pleasant
i
know
cloves
are
in
there
the
taste
is
similar
with
many
different
flavors
very
smooth
flavorful
yet
robust
with
a
wellhidden
9
kick
that
you
feel
in
your
head
rather
than
your
tongue
the
label
of
the
bottle
is
amazing
and
the
title
is
french
for
the
end
of
the
world
for
me
personally
this
is
the
endallbeall
of
great
beer
i
also
love
the
sound
of
the
cork
popping
these
are
now
available
at
my
local
grocer
the
nice
one
anyway
for
around
7
a
bottle
awesome
deal
o
im
still
trying
to
find
a
spot
in
my
heart
for
belgians
usually
they
are
too
malty
and
peppery
for
me
and
i
find
myself
disliking
the
flavor
this
was
a
decent
beer
with
an
adequate
taste
that
many
would
find
very
enjoyable
but
what
i
really
liked
was
the
overall
mouthfeel
refreshing
341ml
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
golden
with
a
modest
white
head
and
some
yeast
particulate
floaties
nose
is

orange

grannysmith
apples
initial
taste
shows
how
high
the
carbonation
is
in
this
tripel
lots
of
yeast
bubblegum
citrus
cloves
and
tropical
fruit
very
smooth
and
creamy
rather
than
watery
and
acidic
alcohol
is
perfectly
hidden
refreshing
not
too
light
and
awesome
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
fell
in
love
with
o
probably
my
favorite
beer
in
the
style
tripel
and
a
great
example
of
it
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
making
the
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
but
i
know
it
needs
to
be
sipped
or
it
really
sneaks
up
on
you
definitely
one
to
have
again
overall
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
to
drink
beer
this
beer
has
one
of
the
best
feels
of
any
beer
i
have
ever
had
as
it
seems
to
match
and
complement
the
flavor
transitions
perfectly
this
is
definitely
one
to
try
hazy

vanilla
clove
lemon

moderate

holy

this
is
a
wonderful
beer
fruity

but
with
no
cloying
toosweet
flavors
you
get
the
pears
and
tropical
fruit
but
when
coupled
with
gentle
hopping
the
flavor
profile
mellows
into
a
balanced
pleasant
drinkability
the
hazy
appearance
is
lovely
and
golden
this
is
a
great
late

beer
i
will
certainly
get
it
again
o
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
tripel
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
overall
impression
honestly
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
and
admittedly
my
expectation
may
have
colored
my
impression
of
the
beer
i
love
belgian
ales
and
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
great
one
its
just
good
its
certainly
not
as
sweet
as
it
smells
and
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
belgians
that
i
have
had
especially
since
it
ends
on
a
dry
bitter
note
that
i
am
not
wild
about
it
is
complex
it
has
a
richness
of
flavor
the
best
part
of
the
taste
is
the
middle
where
some
of
the
characteristics
of
a
classic
belgian
come
outbut
i
think
that
the
best
part
of
the
beer
is
how
it
looks
it
looks
perfect
and
pretty
tm
incredibly
fruity
flavor
pear
apple
papaya
moderately
sweet
and
fullbodied
not
all
that
carbonated
in
the
mouth
slight
solvent
taste
and
sensation
in
the
back
of
the
throat
rjt
this
is
a
well
done
tripel
ale
balanced
extremely
well
and
fairly
complex
load
of
fruits
and
esters
can
be
picked
out
of
this
one
sweet
without
being
too
sweet
and
fairly
mild
on
the
palate
for
a
9
abv
brew
bravo
o
this
is
a
tripel
a
tripel
that
is
brewed
in
quebec
canada
now
these
are
the
most
well
known
people
to
brew
a
belgium
to
the
rights
of
a
standard
belgium
tripel
this
brewery
holds
the
closest
path
to
belgium
from
america
you
want
a
good
belgium
look
for
uniboure
not
a
let
down
at
the
least
ofin
du
monde
remains
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
everything
is
just
done
so
well
the
smell
the
flavors
the
feel
cest
magnifique
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pale
brew
to
sip
on
or
pair
with
some
cheese
look
no
further
o
an
excellent
and
faithful
example
of
the
style
crisp
and
refreshing
excellent
complexity
while
maintaining
balance
of
flavors
very
strong
belgian
yeast
presence
that
one
really
stands
out
definitely
seek
this
one
out
if
that
is
your
thing
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
hybrid
between
a
tripel
and
wit
the
alcohol
is
hidden
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
staples
must
try
tripel
o
this
beer
has
been
executed
perfectly
while
im
not
a
regular
drinker
of
tripels
this
makes
me
appreciate
the
style
and
helps
me
understand
the
intentions
of
other
breweries
when
they
attempt
to
brew
one
o
a
high
quality
beer
that
never
disappoints
and
that
all
craft
beer
lovers
should
try
oone
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
without
question
okay
its
a
great
brew
i
just
like
other
heavy
hitting
tripels
a
bit
better
2
thumbs
up
overall
ok
would
not
purchase
again
as
it
is
not
my
style
i
am
a
hop
head
this
brew
was
too
sweet
and
reminded
me
of
fallen
fruit
off
a
tree
which
is
fermenting
still
more
interesting
than
macro
and
the
abv
kept
me
entertained
o
this
is
an
extremely
wellrounded
tripel
that
i
wont
think
twice
about
purchasing
in
the
near
future
probably
my
favorite
beer
as
of
now
pours
a
hazy
golden
sunrise
color
with
a
tremendous
towering
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
in
chunks
leaving
a
rocky
lace
and
spider
webs
across
the
glass
nose
is
of
fruity
esters
with
notes
of
banana
clove
bubblegum
and
a
bit
of
spicy
alcohol
fairly
full
in
body
with
a
very
fine
champagnelike
carbonation
that
is
oh
so
smooth
taste
begins
with
a
good
deal
of
fruitiness
nectarine
pear
peach
mango
and
white
grape
and
flowery
honey
blended
with
peppery
clove
next
comes
some
powdery
yeasts
and
a
bit
of
bready
malt
followed
by
a
touch
of
drying
alcohol
o
this
was
one
of
those
perpetually
available
phenomenal
beers
that
i
pass
up
on
every
time
at
the
store
because
it
will
always
be
there
anyway
i
decided
to
grab
a
single
during
a
recent
haul
and
i
was
not
disappointed
the
aroma
is
amazing
and
the
flavor
is
good
although
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
bit
too
sugary
sweet
at
some
points
not
one
i
get
regularly
but
certainly
a
benchmark
for
the
style
o
overall
this
is
just
one
of
my
favorite
beers
out
there
great
belgian
yeast
going
on
it
here
so
spicy
mildly
fruity
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
and
utterly
drinkable
i
love
this
beer
probably
in
my
top
ten
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
hazy
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
the
smell
is
fruity
and
yeasty
the
taste
is
banana
up
front
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
mouth
feel
is
awesome
well
carobonated
and
smooth
going
down
with
no
aftertaste
overall
this
is
really
good
and
i
have
never
had
anything
like
this
o
a
good
beer
unlike
anything
i
have
tasted
before
it
was
probably
too
sophisticated
for
me
to
truly
appreciate
but
i
did
like
it
just
wont
be
going
back
for
more
o
this
is
one
great
trippel
keeps
me
coming
back
as
its
not
overbearing
and
has
a
soothing
flavor
like
drinking
a
fine
brandy
made
of
beer
o
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
and
definitely
the
best
unibroue
beer
imo
it
never
gets
old
to
drink
a
slightly
aboveaverage
tripel
with
unibroues
signature
qualities
throughout
the
first
sip
is
delicious
as
it
warms
any
balance
it
could
have
goes
out
the
window
sweet
but
not
sugary
if
you
love
the
style
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
mr
liquors
in
vernon
connecticut
poured
into
a
rochefort
goblet
beautiful
light
gold
bubbly
ale
with
a
petry
dish
foam
and
a
semiclear
consistency
smells
of
green
apple
clove
banana
pear
wheat
hops
and
honey
taste
similarly
follows
with
the
green
apple
sweetness
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
the
only
flaw
of
this
is
how
the
flavor
dies
off
a
bit
as
the
brew
begins
to
warm
uncharacteristic
of
a
stronger
brew
and
it
has
a
bit
too
much
excess
gas
other
than
that
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
that
is
easily
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
enjoy
wow
i
wasnt
expecting
this
big
sticky
head
cloudy
yellow
color
tingles
on
the
tongue
slight
hints
of
orange
peel
sneaky
high
alcohol
content
refreshing
yet
tastes
great
my
wife
with
beer
tastes
very
different
than
mine
also
loved
it
one
of
my
new
favorites
overall
this
beer
is
a
true
winner
in
my
book
it
is
without
question
in
ranks
as
one
of
the
best
triples
in
the
world
mouthfeel
is
light
and
pleasant
overall
this
is
very
good
a
beer
that
i
go
back
to
time
and
again
im
very
surprised
ive
never
reviewed
it
odhave
had
this
before
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
highly
regarded
one
of
the
more
drinkable
tripels
i
have
had
price
tag
is
a
bit
steep
but
its
a
classic
canada
does
belgium
well
oit
was
a
really
good
beer
however
i
did
not
see
what
everyone
is
crazy
about
ill
have
to
try
it
again
sometime
overall
its
a
solid
beer
havent
had
it
in
about
a
decade
dont
need
to
have
it
again
any
time
soon
taste
is
banana
up
front
with
a
nice
chewy
bready
malt
middle
a
very
nice
sting
from
the
carbonation
with
some
bitter
spice
notes
clove
an
excellent
beer
maybe
not
a
lot
going
on
but
the
few
notes
are
played
excellently
and
come
together
in
a
beautiful
harmony
of
flavor
will
get
it
again
overall
an
excellent
excellent
beer
i
was
skeptical
after
my
first
sniff
but
it
still
blew
my
socks
off
wow
what
a
shock
im
not
a
big
fan
of
lagers
but
this
lager
is
anything
but
the
look
of
it
as
you
pour
it
into
a
glass
is
that
of
an
unfiltered
wheat
beer
a
thick
golden
color
with
a
well
balanced
head
it
has
a
strong
nose
of
citrus
with
a
taste
to
match
it
your
mouth
is
left
with
a
strong
yet
pleasant
aftertaste
that
lingers
i
enjoy
this
brew
as
much
as
any
from
this
canadian
based
brewery
a
must
have
o
although
a
little
yeastier
than
i
personally
prefer
but
was
my
first
tripel
foray
and
i
was
impressed
this
took
me
around
1
hour
to
finish
one
bottle
and
should
be
respected
by
drinking
slowly
this
is
definately
not
my
style
of
beer
but
i
respect
the
complexity
of
this
brew
enough
to
weed
through
my
own
personal
bias
and
rate
it
on
my
interpretation
of
the
style
d
a
complex
but
accessible
tripel
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
touch
disappointed
in
the
end
though
while
this
is
definitely
a
world
class
beer
and
one
of
the
best
tripels
period
this
didnt
totally
blow
me
away
and
it
wasnt
really
miles
apart
from
similar
offerings
from
unibroue
i
would
consider
blonde
de
chambly
la
gaillarde
and
eau
benite
to
be
in
ways
quite
comparable
to
la
fin
du
monde
but
thats
no
knock
on
this
brew
as
ive
enjoyed
all
of
those
afformentioned
comparisons
immensely
o
very
tasty
and
more
complex
than
most
o
an
outstanding
flagship
brew
from
ddc
i
have
enjoyed
this
off
an
on
over
the
years
before
i
was
ever
a
beer
geek
and
will
continued
to
do
so
with
appreciation
and
gratitude
to
me
this
drinks
like
a
wit
tripel
i
like
it
o
great
beer
unibroue
does
the
best
belgian
style
beers
outside
of
belgium
its
amazing
how
they
can
distribute
throughout
canada
and
parts
of
the
us
and
europe
and
still
have
this
great
taste
will
i
buy
this
again
absolutely
i
really
like
this
beer
the
pour
is
quite
light
and
yellowish
the
smell
is
very
clear
with
dominate
fruits
at
its
core
the
taste
was
one
of
the
best
ive
had
it
is
quite
smooth
and
despite
9
alcohol
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
beer
the
fruitiness
orange
apricot
is
very
pleasant
there
are
also
a
slight
caramel
malt
taste
to
it
overall
those
folks
up
in
quebec
done
did
it
good
overall
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
highly
rated
it
deserves
it
excellent
from
the
time
it
is
poured
into
your
glass
until
the
last
drink
highly
recommended
i
will
buy
and
drink
this
again
this
is
a
strong
candidate
for
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
i
wouldnt
be
ashamed
to
show
up
at
any
beer
party
with
this
in
tow
overall
a
very
nice
showing
certainly
shines
above
most
tripels
its
pretty
widely
available
and
worth
checking
out
o
outstanding
tripel
probably
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
worth
seeking
out
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
one
finger
head
with
carbonation
bubbles
rising
steadily
leaves
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
of
wheat
citrus
and
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
grapefruit
tastes
very
much
like
a
wheat
ale
although
very
pleasant
without
the
lemon
dish
soap
aftertaste
some
mild
citrus
very
faint
hops
and
light
malt
the
mouthfeel
keeps
the
same
flavors
although
it
greatly
opens
ip
the
wheat
the
citrus
also
comes
through
a
bit
more
overall
it
reminded
me
of
a
very
good
wheat
ale
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
although
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
any
beer
with
wheat
flavor
but
this
one
was
good
an
outstanding
beer
i
can
see
why
even
though
this
is
not
rare
by
any
means
this
beer
is
still
clinging
to
its
place
in
the
top
100
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
if
you
like
tripels
this
is
a
must
try
unibroue
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
north
america
dont
let
the
appearance
fool
you
this
is
a
pale
clearish
straw
golden
beer
with
largeish
bubbles
it
seemed
to
me
that
were
bolder
than
the
measley
weakling
bubbles
produced
by
cristal
for
example
however
it
is
no
pabst
youll
notice
it
stinks
spicy
is
a
good
start
but
the
banana
and
fruit
really
clobber
you
after
that
once
drinking
is
commenced
the
fin
du
monde
tastes
like
a
perfectly
spiced
indian
dessert
cardamom
and
clove
flavors
are
present
the
carbonation
is
just
about
spot
on
for
my
first
ever
restaurantbeer
and
a
blind
choice
by
me
with
no
prior
knowledge
of
unibroue
or
la
fin
other
than
a
love
of
the
trippel
style
id
rate
this
a
65
oone
of
my
favorite
triples
great
flavor
and
complexity
notes
very
good
d
simply
one
of
the
greatest
beers
ive
ever
had
i
cant
believe
ive
never
had
this
until
now
i
can
see
this
being
the
only
beer
i
ever
drink
when
im
like
40
and
older
eruditely
crafted
o
just
an
amazing
beer
this
is
for
sure
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
and
it
never
gets
old
a
very
seesionable
beer
at
least
for
9
abv
overall
as
with
the
last
2
unibroue
brews
ive
tried
and
im
guessing
the
4th
too
this
beer
rides
on
its
excellent
mouthfeel
to
give
it
its
distinctive
mark
in
the
beer
world
entirely
smooth
and
drinkable
deceptive
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
a
reason
it
is
unique
and
absolutely
huge
given
the
sweet
nature
truly
the
pinnacle
of
what
unibroe
has
produced
and
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
until
they
cease
production
o
glad
to
get
around
to
reviewing
this
one
perhaps
unibroues
best
offering
easily
a
top
shelf
tripel
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
triples
i
have
had
and
one
of
the
few
beers
from
unibroue
that
i
actually
like
o
excellent
drinkability
it
goes
down
well
without
offending
the
senses
and
while
it
is
not
to
my
usual
taste
it
is
quite
nice
with
a
pleasant
buzz
to
boot
cloudy
golden
pour
3
inch
cream
head
good
lacing
reminds
me
very
much
of
other
unibroue
brews
in
smell
and
taste
smell
of
almond
pear
raisin
taste
much
the
same
light
creamy
flavorful
amazing
mouthfeel
probably
the
most
easy
of
all
the
unibroues
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
findability
highly
recommended
the
taste
is
very
light
for
such
a
big
beer
the
aftertaste
is
the
highpoint
wonderful
i
would
like
the
beer
if
it
were
more
tart
but
i
like
it
the
way
it
is
just
fine
as
well
recommended
after
trying
many
other
triples
i
came
back
to
la
fin
du
monde
and
remembered
why
it
was
so
highly
rated
there
arent
many
tripels
made
outside
of
belgium
that
are
this
good
maybe
none
o
very
good
tripel
but
i
am
just
about
done
with
spice
as
ive
had
a
lot
of
spiced
beers
in
the
last
couple
of
days
will
come
back
to
it
but
i
dont
think
its
quite
on
par
with
the
trappist
versions
bottle
poured
into
glass
pouts
mostly
clear
gold
with
white
head
that
leaves
considerable
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
full
of
fruity
esters
notes
of
banana
heavy
clove
some
notes
of
lemon
taste
features
more
of
the
same
as
the
nose
very
estery
lots
of
spice
and
nice
balance
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
overall
delicious
example
of
style
overall
a
great
tripel
recently
i
tried
the
st
bernardus
tripel
which
is
much
smoother
and
more
malty
than
the
fin
i
also
like
the
allagash
tripel
so
when
it
comes
to
tripels
one
of
my
favorite
styles
it
is
best
to
try
a
lot
of
them
and
rotate
tastings
o
most
of
the
attributes
of
this
beer
are
good
but
the
taste
is
just
spectacular
worldclass
in
my
opinion
great
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
thick
white
head
excellent
retention
excellent
lacing
smells
a
bit
on
the
boozy
side
some
fruits
and
spice
there
too
while
the
alcohol
scent
is
strong
it
isnt
bad
at
all
the
taste
is
something
else
very
floral
and
grainy
belgian
yeast
gives
it
a
nice
flavor
bananas
clove
citrus
so
much
going
on
here
feels
thick
with
medium
carbonation
love
this
classic
pours
cloudy
but
radiant
orangey
gold
with
a
moderate
white
head
with
reaosnable
lacing
smells
like
epic
fruity
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
fermented
pear
allspice
and
citrus
dominate
the
nose
while
wheat
malt
and
banana
creep
into
the
flavor
profile
the
balance
and
complexity
of
this
beer
are
unrivaled
heaps
and
heaps
of
floral
notes
as
well
yeasty
but
crisp
at
the
same
time
there
is
also
an
alcohol
warmth
which
is
rather
addicting
especially
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
near
perfect
absolutely
brilliant
carbonation
that
just
dances
in
the
mouth
jivey
and
fresh
medium
body
but
light
color
can
be
heavy
at
room
temperature
but
spot
on
when
chilly
this
is
one
for
the
ages
maybe
the
best
tripel
out
there
o
if
you
havent
tried
this
you
really
have
to
very
worth
the
positive
ratings
it
receives
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tried
to
date
at
first
it
is
sweet
and
maybe
a
little
bland
then
the
heavier
yeast
flavor
kicks
in
a
with
a
slight
choppy
aftertaste
sits
well
in
the
mouth
easy
to
drink
but
feels
substantial
not
complicated
tastes
but
not
a
shallow
beer
either
o
a
fantastic
tripel
one
of
the
true
classics
for
myself
tripel
has
never
been
a
style
i
got
very
excited
about
id
be
happy
drinking
this
at
any
party
but
for
my
own
buck
id
just
as
readily
spend
it
on
some
of
the
trappist
examples
instead
a
must
try
recommended
highly
overall
put
this
one
back
for
a
little
over
a
year
have
had
this
nice
brew
many
times
before
very
nice
triple
gonna
grab
some
more
and
age
longer
before
summing
this
up
let
me
say
that
tripels
are
not
my
favorite
style
that
said
this
beer
is
the
perfect
tripel
to
complement
trois
pistoles
the
belgian
strong
dark
ale
from
unibroue
both
have
enigmatic
flavor
profiles
that
are
difficult
to
wrap
your
head
around
you
think
you
know
whats
coming
when
you
take
a
sip
but
somehow
the
flavors
seem
surprising
this
beer
and
its
cousin
are
not
everyday
pours
but
definitely
deserve
repeated
visits
from
every
beer
advocate
walk
home
truly
worldclass
and
highly
recommended
for
my
inexperienced
beer
palate
it
is
the
best
ive
ever
tasted
but
judging
from
the
other
reviews
about
this
beer
im
certainly
not
alone
in
thinking
so
o
fantastic
complex
elegant
and
a
quite
enjoyable
beverage
o
wow
this
is
truly
a
delicious
tripel
i
loved
everything
about
it
complex
and
elegant
with
bold
flavors
and
easy
drink
ability
i
enjoy
this
both
cold
and
room
temp
this
will
be
a
regular
pleasure
for
me
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
for
9
it
is
easily
approachable
and
enjoyable
but
carries
with
it
a
warmth
that
is
to
be
respected
it
has
a
good
rounded
character
about
it
that
makes
it
dangerously
light
and
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
getting
in
trouble
with
several
bottles
of
this
despite
the
warming
impact
it
has
certainly
worth
a
try
notes
severed
in
a
chalice
original

i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
fans
of
belgian
brews
d
an
excellent
unibroue
product
thats
very
worthy
of
the
high
accolades
o
simply
awesome
and
perhaps
my
favorite
of
the
unibroue
classics
next
to
maudite
like
duvel
i
suggest
sampling
la
fin

as
fresh
as
possilbe

the

this

it

is
about
the

not
your
usual

but
a
walk
on
the
canadian
side
this

is
one
of
canadas

o
this
is
a
truly
fantastic

a
refreshing

take
on
the

at

from
what
i
am
used
to
more
often

not
i
have
been
disappointed
with
unibroue
as
a

la

is
an
elite

no

i
can
do
without
many
of

pales

ill
be
back
now
and
again
to
enjoy
this

tripel

this
is
my
favorite
beer
by
far
poured
a
12ounce
bottle
into
a
mad
elf
tulip
glass
pours
golden
pretty
much
a
standard
appearance
for
a
tripel
aroma
is
extremely
fruity
almost
overwhelming
the
taste
almost
completely
matches
the
aroma
such
an
aggressive
spiciness
to
this
beer
that
it
borders
on
perfumy
overall
a
decent
beer
fr
an
excellent
canadian
brewery
but
probably
on
the
average
end
of
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
in
my
opinion
when
i
go
for
a
unibroue
brew
i
go
for
maudite
i
find
it
so
much
better
drinkability
always
a
winner
great
belgian
tripel
from
canada
overall
this
is
a
winner
nothing
too
out
of
the
box
but
exactly
to
the
style
with
that
classic
unibroue
yeast
quality
to
it
for
me
the
la
fin
du
monde
is
the
epitome
of
beer
world
class
indeed
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
very
hazy
golden
with
a
finger
length
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
is
left
on
top
and
there
is
some
lacing
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
fruit
and
yeast
it
reminds
me
of
a
hefeweizen
only
the
smell
is
a
little
more
potent
the
flavors
of
fruit
and
malt
really
come
through
in
this
brew
but
it
is
not
too
sweet
the
alcohol
does
come
through
only
slightly
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
pleasing
balance
to
this
beer
from
the
spice
and
the
flavors
from
the
malt
and
the
yeast
the
flavors
of
fruit
really
come
through

this

it
is
not

the

to
this
beer
from
the
spice
and
the
flavors
from
the
malt
and
the
yeast
it
is
very
easy
to
gulp
but
you
want
to
sip
this
and
savor
it
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
tripels
if
not
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tried
overall
i
was
extremely
disappointed
with
this
beer
but
finished
the
glass
bc
a
bad
beer
isnt
the
end
of
the
world
poured
into
a
snifter
heightening
the
perfumelike
spice
aromas
which
i
am
not
a
fan
of
it
pours
a
nice
cap
of
head
with
a
beautiful
golden
glow
and
such
wonderful
texture
unfortunately
this
was
the
only
part
i
found
appealing
about
this
beer
the
taste
is
way
over
spiced
and
borders
on
the
artificial
for
me
it
is
this
observers
opinion
that
this
beer
along
with
the
rest
of
the
unibroue
line
are
cheap
imitations
of
noble
beer
styles
all
with
an
artificial
tasting
backbone
i
really
dont
understand
all
the
acclaim
this
beer
continues
to
receive
but
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
me
as
just
about
everyone
from
the
uninitiated
to
the
most
seasoned
beer
enthusiasts
seem
to
give
it
such
high
praise
incredibly
disappointing
each
and
every
time
ive
revisited
it
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
dont
really
see
it
being
the
most
addictive
beer
ill
ever
have
per
se
you
do
get
your
moneys
worth
though
and
if
you
like
tripels
i
can
see
you
liking
this
beer
if
nothing
else
la
fin
du
monde
has
me
curious
about
the
tripels
now
mouthfeel
is
nearperfect
as
well
with
semisharp
carbonation
offsetting
the
lack
of
bite
from
the
taste
this
thing
tickles
the
physical
mouth
at
proper
aggression
level
while
soothing
taste
buds
in
a
stealthily
satisfiying
way
just
try
this
beer
another
hit
from
unibroue
they
are
shaping
up
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
what
can
i
say
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
at
all
it
is
incredible
true
to
its
ominous
name
if
the
end
of
the
world
were
truly
upon
us
this
is
the
beer
id
want
to
be
drinking
when
it
all
went
down
this
is
a
really
good
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
is
very
drinkable
real
fruity
with
all
kinds
of
things
going
through
nose
alcohol
in
smell
but
not
noticeable
in
taste
spicy
in
nose
and
taste
rounds
out
with
yeasty
aftertaste
high
carb
pops
hops
in
mouth
and
swallowing
keeps
taste
in
mouth
for
days
overall
a
delicious
triple
offering
from
canada
with
great
burps
if
you
loved
this
beer
i
suggest
you
try
the
dragonmead
final
absolution
as
well
similar
in
style
quality
and
provenience
delicious
wish
i
had
more
of
these
o
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
inexpensive
and
easily
available
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
excellent
medium
light
body
with
excellent
carbonation
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
tripel
to
me
all
of
unibroues
beers
have
a
unique
characteristic
i
wish
i
knew
the
ingredients
and
the
process
o
a
solid
contender
in
its
class
id
have
another
but
i
wouldnt
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
get
one
overall
a
nice
fruity
drinkable
beer
it
goes
nicely
with
spice
wings
and
grilled
seafood
also
if
you
reduce
it
over
low
heat
in
a
sauce
pan
it
mixes
well
with
mix
berries
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
great
brewery
fortunately
readily
available
in
ontario
considering
we
dont
get
many
exceptional
beers
this
is
always
ncie
to
grab
from
the
beer
store
o
ive
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
this
beer
and
it
was
definitely
tasty
im
not
going
to
say
i
havent
had
better
tripels
but
one
sure
positive
regarding
this
beer
is
the
way
it
hides
the
alcohol
no
sign
of
it
anywhere
at
any
point
the
major
downside
is
that
it
just
smells
and
drinks
way
too
much
like
a
witbier
for
my
taste
nevertheless
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
seems
wellsuited
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
just
wish
it
was
a
little
less
than
11
per
4
pack
of
12
ouncers
fairly
effervescent
and
medium
bodied
o
a
really
great
easydrinking
belgianstyle
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
in
the
taste
o
a
fair
representation
of
a
triple
the
overall
smoothness
while
retaining
a
full
body
sets
this
one
apart
carbonation
is
pretty
high
if
you
are
impatient
in
drinking
it
take
your
time
and
you
will
see
why
the
beer
scores
so
high
the
flavors
are
layered
never
over
the
top
and
keeps
you
wanting
more
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
bleach
white
head
some
light
orange
hues
are
noticable
the
longer
i
look
oh
how
i
love
the
smell
of
a
tripel
apple
pear
clove
black
pepper
yeast
and
booze
getting
some
earthy
tones
off
the
first
sip
that
black
pepper
is
back
also
this
beer
definitely
doesnt
hide
the
fact
that
its
9
this
beer
is
smooth
at
first
but
im
not
digging
the
carbonation
on
the
way
down
overall
a
very
very
solid
tripel
but
ive
had
better
o
incredibly
smooth
complex
and
balanced
it
should
be
hard
to
find
a
better
tripel
overall
good
representation
of
a
tripel
by
unibroue
i
like
that
the
fruity
bananaclove
flavours
did
not
overpower
the
entire
beer
one
of
my
favourites
to
come
back
to
from
unibroue
overall
quite
impressive
love
the
champagnelike
quality
of
the
carbonation
makes
it
an
interesting
drinking
experience
i
remember
having
this
one
in
college
when
i
first
started
drinking
craft
beer
and
i
had
no
idea
where
to
even
locate
it
on
the
style
spectrum
nice
to
revisit
it
with
a
new
appreciation
a
o
an
excellent
ale
allaround
quite
fruity
wellbalanced
and
incredibly
smooth
overall
a
really
great
beer
smell
and
taste
are
both
very
good
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
pours
like
a
murky
apple
cider
with
a
couple
of
fingers
of
delicate
shortlived
white
froth
minimal
beading
smells
lovely
cloves
banana
soft
citrus
candylike
booze
very
unique
taste
its
got
all
the
elements
of
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
some
white
grapes
or
apple
very
smooth
and
virtually
zero
traceable
alcohol
burn
the
body
is
light
easydrinking
which
really
goes
a
long
way
here
a
well
executed
refreshing
tripel
everything
about
this
beer
is
awe
inspiring
if
you
are
a
fan
of
belgian
style
tripels
this
is
a
must
try
be
forewarned
though
this
beer
is
very
deceiving
as
the
9
alcohol
is
well
concealed
mlight
and
bubbly
does
not
taste
like
9
very
light
o
this
is
a
very
complex
well
made
triple
with
a
huge
flavor
profile
i
really
want
to
give
this
a
5
but
i
didnt
get
the
big
creamy
head
that
is
supposed
to
be
typical
for
this
style
im
not
sure
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
a
creamy
head
since
this
is
bottle
conditioned
with
carbonation
that
reminds
me
of
fine
champaign
i
am
going
to
make
this
a
regular
part
of
my
lineup
and
look
forward
to
pairing
it
with
food
overall
b
understated
tripel
overall
very
interesting
brew
with
a
very
intriguing
taste
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
i
look
forward
to
having
again
soon
doa
overall
a
wonderful
beer
at
a
decent
price
my
favorite
from
the
brewer
o
pretty
decent
for
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
unibroue
absolutely
resplendent
this
beer
truly
is
worthy
of
the
end
of
the
world
o
i
kept
finding
scents
and
flavors
in
la
fin
du
monde
the
dryness
keeps
it
from
being
my
favorite
tripel
but
i
cant
deny
that
it
is
a
wonderfully
complex
and
well
designed
beer
d
la
fin
du
monde
is
a
crisp
and
dry
offering
from
unibroue
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
dry
bubbly
champagne
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
think
of
this
as
a
champagne
like
beer
drink
in
moderation
for
optimal
enjoyment
try
with
spicy
thai
red
curry
soup
the
malty
sweet
and
sharpness
of
the
carbonation
balanced
off
the
sweet
and
salty
also
paired
with
a
more
classic
french
dish
of
creamy
potatoes
pan
fred
trout
and
asparagus
the
full
flavour
and
dry
aftertaste
compliment
the
fish
and
butter
in
the
dish
great
offering
bottom
line
if
you
can
get
it
dont
pass
it
up
its
worth
the
810
bucks
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
theres
definitely
a
high
sweetness
level
here
that
is
cut
nicely
with
some
doughiness
in
both
flavor
an
taste
yeast
banana
pear
apricot
spice
the
doughiness
cuts
into
that
sweetness
nicely
and
allows
me
to
really
enjoy
what
would
otherwise
be
a
overl
sweet
beer
for
me
personally
a
nice
medium
bodied
maybe
even
a
little
heavy
creamy
moutfeel
i
had
tried
one
unibroue
offering
prior
to
this
and
really
disliked
it
and
almost
wrote
the
entire
brewery
off
so
glad
that
i
didnt
as
this
is
a
mighty
fine
brew
that
i
would
have
hated
myself
for
if
i
never
gave
it
a
try
i
have
had
this
beer
several
times
while
i
am
impressed
by
the
beer
i
am
not
as
overwhelmed
as
others
poured
from
the
bottle
the
beer
radiates
a
pleasant
sour
but
fruity
aroma
the
scent
gives
a
positive
hint
of
what
is
to
come
giving
a
moderate
head
the
color
is
a
cloudly
golden
color
the
initial
taste
is
a
nice
fruity
sour
flavor
it
almost
seems
like
a
orange
flavored
belgian
for
some
reason
i
feel
like
the
taste
should
be
somewhat
more
complex
being
a
tripel
it
is
somewhat
thick
some
might
even
describe
it
as
being
slightly
chewy
there
is
some
degree
of
spiciness
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
accompanied
by
a
slight
warming
sensation
as
the
beer
goes
down
while
the
aftertaste
is
mild
it
does
leave
a
pleasant
reminder
to
me
this
transcends
not
only
the
tripel
style
but
beers
as
a
whole
theres
something
really
magical
happening
here
amid
the
purposefully
overthetop
recipe
that
makes
you
sit
back
and
relax
and
enjoy
life
no
matter
how
insane
and
alcoholic
it
is
by
the
end
its
a
balanced
beer
unlike
anything
else
im
having
trouble
describing
it
myself
however
its
a
good
pairing
with
any
cuisine
especially
spicy
mexican
or
latin
food
thai
food
could
also
work
well
if
not
pairing
with
food
i
recommend
that
it
be
consumed
with
patience
and
respect
this
is
intense
yet
marvelous
stuff
pours
a
cloudy
goldstraw
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
retention
isnt
great
but
that
is
to
be
expected
with
a
9
abv
beer
smell
is
bready
and
of
apples
and
cloves
taste
first
comes
through
with
soft
and
sweet
wheat
a
hint
of
apple
a
touch
of
alcohol
smooth
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
this
is
a
fantastic
triple
though
not
my
personal
favorite
taste
is
baked
apples
croissantlike
buttery
bread
soft
alcohol
it
has
a
crisp
resonance
on
the
tongue
from
the
carbonation
that
i
think
is
truly
awesome
in
the
way
it
balances
out
both
the
beers
pillowy
softeness
and
alcohol
content
la
fin
du
mondes
tasty
characteristics
certainly
place
it
ahead
of
the
pack
i
tried
a
green
flash
tripel
last
week
on
tap
and
it
was
good
this
is
much
better
o
this
has
awesome
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
is
just
delicious
and
the
feel
is
great
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
is
a
wonderful
representation
of
the
style
i
should
not
have
put
off
trying
this
beer
for
so
long
i
highly
recommend
trying
it
out
i
will
be
picking
more
bottles
of
this
up
overall
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
over
the
years
and
have
now
decided
to
review
it
truly
a
world
class
beer
and
so
happy
to
have
enjoyed
this
years
ago
in
quebec
city
and
now
again
and
again
here
in
new
england
overall
complex
bold
enough
extra
smooth
just
had
the
westmalle
for
the
first
time
earlier
this
week
which
is
of
course
superior
to
this
also
impressive
brew
i
tried
this
beer
once
several
years
ago
on
a
whim
just
to
try
something
different
i
was
amused
at
the
name
and
graphic
depiction
of
quebec
at
the
time
i
thought
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
have
tasted
many
fine
beers
since
that
time
always
thinking
id
find
something
better
i
havent
yet
but
i
have
held
off
a
few
points
on
the
off
chance
that
i
will
someday
but
if
i
dont
ill
still
die
happy
o
a
very
very
good
tripel
balanced
throughout
reviewed
on
01272011
023434
o
a
solid
triple
for
sure
this
style
really
isnt
my
preferred
cup
of
tea
but
i
still
have
great
respect
for
it
this
particular
one
has
lots
of
tasty
flavors
going
on
and
the
booze
is
well
hidden
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
solid
4
out
of
5
not
necessarily
an
every
day
beer
but
really
good
beer
would
recommend
this
beer
with
some
desert
after
supper
o
excellent
beer
if
all
triples
were
this
good
i
would
drink
a
lot
more
of
them
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
served
at
about
40f
which
seemed
a
bit
cold
but
no
major
change
in
flavor
or
aroma
as
beer
warmed
up
to
4648
o
fantastic
readily
available
tripel
a
great
beer
to
introduce
a
novice
into
the
style
o
a
great
belgianstyle
i
would
recommend
this
beer
though
personally
would
choose
something
different
in
the
future
for
myself
i
think
allagash
tripel
and
curieux
are
both
similar
and
better
than
la
fin
du
monde
its
a
well
made
belgian
style
beer
however
and
im
very
happy
to
have
enjoyed
it
i
have
another
that
ill
plan
to
age
to
see
how
it
does
o
ok
beer
for
me
but
not
my
top
choice
would
prefer
more
malt
a
magnificent
tripel
and
one
of
my
personal
benchmarks
of
the
style
i
think
ive
had
this
bottle
a
while
in
the
fridge
albeit
and
it
still
drinks
great
cant
help
but
wonder
what
actual
cellaring
would
do
for
it
easily
classable
with
tripels
twice
the
price
you
cant
really
beat
this
one
for
the
price
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
outright
a
real
standby
beer
cheers
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
never
disappoints
overall
great
for
the
style
2
5
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
murky
amber
and
golden
body
aroma
is
yeasty
with
dark
fruit
mostly
red
apples
and
spices
flavor
is
excellent
with
a
nice
yeast
and
spice
profile
on
a
caramel
malt
backbone
very
crisp
moderate
to
high
carbonation
and
medium
body
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
long
time
the
apple
notes
are
especially
good
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
goto
beer
when
available
o
very
tasty
beer
its
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
the
9
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
its
a
very
good
beer
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
this
again
this
really
is
a
world
class
brew
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
i
when
i
first
tried
this
i
could
not
put
the
glass
down
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
goes
down
very
smooth
sticky
rich
a
good
triple
to
share
finally
reviewing
this
one
pours
an
opaque
and
dull
golden
orange
with
a
thin
pillow
soft
layer
on
top
this
beer
just
looks
cream
already
not
a
lot
of
retention
2nd
pour
i
poured
it
much
more
aggressively
and
it
gives
such
a
nice
fluffy
2
finger
head
that
shows
great
retention
the
aroma
is
of
orange
peel
some
hay
and
a
slight
medicinal
powder
soft
on
the
palate
with
oranges
and
citrus
peel
slight
lemon
yeasty
a
mild
sweetness
with
some
hay
characteristics
everything
just
goes
well
together
and
precise
a
little
alcohol
as
it
finishes
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
it
is
carbonated
lightly
this
beer
is
so
easy
to
drink
and
i
take
it
for
granted
for
sure
overall
this
is
the
best
in
its
style
and
its
from
canada
anytime
someone
says
i
dont
like
beer
this
is
what
i
suggest
or
arrogant
bastard
last
time
i
had
this
was
for
the
rapture
idiot
unibroue
makes
such
solid
brews
drink
em
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
glass
quite
drinkable
especially
for
a
9
and
quite
enjoyable
tripels
are
not
my
favourite
style
but
this
one
is
done
exceptionally
well
definitely
worth
picking
up
i
have
seen
this
beer
on
the
shelf
at
my
local
grocery
store
for
sometime
now
judging
by
the
strange
name
and
label
i
dismissed
it
in
the
past
it
had
a
price
of
7
50
for
the
750ml
bottle
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
different
with
a
high
abvhad
a
bad
day
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
to
my
surprise
i
saw
a
nice
cloudy
haze
with
a
decent
amount
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
poured
it
into
my
trusty
dfh
pint
glass
the
color
was
a
bright
orangeyellow
with
a
one
finger
head
it
aroma
was
glorious
with
citrus
clove
and
the
obvious
high
abv
the
first
sip
was
a
revelation
i
am
a
big
hefeweisen
fan
and
this
tripple
was
a
close
cousin
the
high
abv
was
overshadowed
by
the
fruit
and
yeast
notes
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
brew
and
that
is
saying
alot
it
turned
my
bad
day
around
180
degrees
prost
t
the
pale
malt
and
sweet
yeast
make
up
most
of
the
flavor
with
some
apple
peel
chalky
yeast
and
some
faint
earthy
hops
really
nicely
done
overall
easy
to
drink
was
a
good
choice
on
new
years
eve
golden
color
with
a
very
thick
white
head
and
tons
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
is
grapefruit
or
lemon
and
maybe
a
little
grass
dry
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
this
is
richly
carbonated
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
now
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
bunch
of
this
its
a
great
one
tough
to
beat
o
it
is
a
drinkable
pleasant
beer
however
it
is
also
nothing
especially
complex
with
spicy
notes
reigning
o
great
tripel
looks
phenomenal
in
my
glass
and
smells
great
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
belgian
personality
the
flavors
are
a
little
straight
forward
but
they
are
well
done
and
it
helps
that
it
is
so
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
betrays
its
alcohol
content
i
could
not
tell
it
was
9
abv
but
it
is
still
not
a
session
beer
truly
it
is
worth
trying
ill
have
this
in
my
fridge
again
dr
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
high
abv
which
doesnt
come
through
id
like
to
try
it
aged
but
i
dont
know
that
itd
be
best
ondraught
a
nice
little
tripel
that
deserves
revisiting
at
6
99
theres
no
reason
not
to
age
it
i
just
wish
theyd
tone
that
damned
lemon
down
d
im
impressed
by
this
one
its
subtly
complex
and
easy
drinking
to
boot
for
the
price
and
quality
itd
be
hard
to
better
merry
christmas
all
hands
down
you
must
try
this
ale
and
now
it
is
easy
to
find
at
least
in
my
state
can
i
have
some
more
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
i
tend
to
shy
away
from
tripels
am
usually
not
a
fan
but
i
have
enjoyed
this
over
other
tripels
i
have
had
o
great
balanced
hi
octane
belgian
style
strong
ale
really
well
hidden
booze
makes
this
an
easy
drinker
but
will
cloud
judgements
3
times
as
fast
that
being
said
this
is
an
excellent
triple
with
very
refined
aromas
and
flavors
excellent
balance
and
skillfully
brewed
the
9
abv
is
never
even
remotely
noticeable
o
my
favorite
tripel
by
far
dont
know
why
it
took
my
so
long
to
try
this
brew
but
im
glad
i
did
its
awesome
that
its
so
easy
to
get
too
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
beer
its
just
a
really
solid
drinker
that
strong
malt
profile
combined
with
an
overpowering
banana
ester
flavor
left
me
looking
for
something
a
little
dryer
like
maybe
a
glass
of
water
o
wow
is
all
i
can
say
this
is
a
beer
that
where
you
will
need
selfcontrol
so
as
to
not
down
the
whole
bottle
in
10
minutes
lest
you
face
its
alcoholic
wrath
its
an
amazingly
refreshing
and
flavorful
drink
that
will
lull
drinkers
into
a
false
sense
of
security
seriously
this
is
9
abv
needless
to
say
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
o
a
very
good
triple
excellent
balance
and
very
nice
drinkability
4
5
oa
very
tasty
tripel
ale
with
great
balance
and
blend
of
flavors
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
quite
enjoyable
nonetheless
i
can
easily
see
others
giving
this
a
very
high
rating
flavorful
and
refreshing
but
better
as
a
slow
sipper
than
as
a
session
brew
complex
aroma
and
flavor
ive
had
this
12
oz
bottle
for
a
year
and
a
screw
cap
no
less
it
still
says
best
before
052713
years
to
go
according
to
these
optimistic
canadians
if
you
consider
price
and
availability
there
isnt
a
better
tripel
the
spice
note
in
the
aroma
and
follows
into
the
taste
is
something
special
almost
peppery
in
the
aftertastei
dont
get
alot
of
fruit
in
this
one
although
there
is
definitely
a
sweetness
back
there
somewhere
hard
to
go
wrong
with
unibroue
and
this
is
their
best
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
bubbly
with
a
bit
of
dry
finish
overall
la
fin
du
monde
is
hard
to
beat
for
the
style
and
a
great
value
at
8
a
bottle
overall
obviously
an
astounding
beer
and
one
that
could
easily
please
even
the
most
discerning
big
tripel
flavors
meet
up
with
qualities
of
a
real
hefeweizen
and
even
a
bit
of
the
freshness
and
unique
spicing
of
a
saison
to
bring
a
sweet
sour
treat
enjoy
it
slow
then
enjoy
a
few
more
this
beer
is
rad
overall
excellent
if
you
can
drink
just
one
too
strong
to
drink
all
day
overall
at
14
ºc
this
is
the
greatest
tripel
from
quebec
that
goes
beyond
the
style
and
expectations
could
be
considered
too
delicious
to
become
a
classic
but
it
certainly
exudes
hard
to
achieve
complexities
brilliant
i
am
definitely
coming
back
for
more
of
this
o
this
beer
is
quite
good
i
mean
really
really
good
considering
it
is
in
pretty
much
every
beer
store
around
and
it
is
definetly
the
best
triple
ive
had
o
a
delicious
tripel
well
crafted
true
belgian
form
id
definitely
have
another
one
o
granted
i
dont
have
extensive
experience
with
triples
but
i
like
this
a
lot
all
of
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
mild
providing
only
a
warming
effect
ill
drink
this
again
for
sure
has
hit
this
one
right
in
the
coffin
if
you
like
belgian
style
beers
or
tripels
you
will
absolutely
love
la
fin
du
monde
o
does
not
show
any
heat
from
the
9
everything
is
a
winner
with
this
one
o
this
isnt
from
belgium
they
have
nailed
the
tripel
style
an
absolute
staple
if
you
are
a
fan
of
belgian
style
beers
overall
an
excellent
example
of
balance
and
wellblended
flavors
smells
etc
superior
feel
drinkability
smell
and
taste
o
a
fantastic
tripel
not
overly
boozy
or
hot
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
brew
to
introduce
friends
to
the
world
of
tripels
and
belgians
overall
really
exceptional
cant
put
it
into
words
o
please
understand
that
i
was
really
impressed
with
westmalles
tripel
and
was
briefly
addicted
to
gnomegang
a
strong
pale
belgian
by
name
but
reminiscent
of
a
tripel
i
must
give
props
to
one
of
the
brewers
that
really
inspired
me
to
drink
beer
unibroue
makes
nothing
but
quality
beer
canadian
but
in
the
belgian
style
this
is
a
worthy
tripel
nice
and
full
strong
and
flavorful
get
one
if
you
dont
know
what
im
talking
about
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
the
wheatlike
malt
effortlessly
blends
with
the
yeast
esters
and
spice
to
create
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
not
that
this
beer
needs
more
good
press
but
it
is
quite
representative
of
the
style
golden
colored
tripel
with
noticeable
belgian
yeasty
esters
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
on
the
end
lots
of
fruit
qualities
waft
up
when
the
beer
is
consumed
and
seem
to
linger
in
its
long
finish
o
excellent
beer
and
a
treat
to
enjoy
a
great
tripel
the
sweetness
and
bready
flavors
are
outstanding
and
well
balanced
the
high
abv
is
only
noticeable
after
finishing
your
second
glass
would
highly
recommend
o
the
only
reason
i
bought
this
was
because
it
was
on
the
top
100
and
i
wanted
to
try
a
tripple
i
was
not
impressed
and
i
am
surprised
it
was
on
the
list
to
begin
with
o
theres
a
reason
why
this
is
cult
status
at
this
point
very
easy
to
drink
and
well
made
o
wow
this
brew
kicks
some
ass
definitely
a
sipper
at
9
abv
this
is
a
well
balanced
rather
complicated
tripel
the
flavors
mesh
well
though
the
coriander
can
be
overwhelming
at
times
overall
though
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
goblet
best
before
2814
date
on
the
back
this
pours
a
nice
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
cloves
banana
coriander
malts
very
nice
feel
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
the
tastes
are
many
of
the
same
spices
and
malts
with
a
nice
dry
finish
this
beer
is
excellent
and
meets
expectations
overall
a
wonderful
beer
flavorful
complex
easy
to
drink
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
o
a
nice
belgian
tripel
overall
a
delicious
beer
i
always
have
a
stash
of
750ml
bottles
around
for
consumption
phenomenal
beer
full
of
flavor
large
chewy
full
carbonated
body
my
perfect
nonstout
morning
beer
with
to
sit
around
and
be
lazy
watching
college
footballbasketball
go
jayhawks
o
excellent
tripel
with
abv
very
well
hidden
i
would
highly
recommend
it
or
drink
again
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
but
as
far
as
tripels
go
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
too
cidery
for
me
thank
you
canada
sweet
taste
too
a
very
well
blended
mix
of
bread
banana
even
peach
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
i
like
for
a
tripel
but
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
tastes
delicious
balance
between
hops
malts
sweet
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
for
such
a
high
abv
excellent
beer
could
have
used
a
touch
more
zest
and
complexity
thats
all
that
kept
it
from
being
a

the
taste
does
not
give
away
at
all
the
potency
of
this
brew
very
smooth
taste
with
little
or
no
strong
alcohol
aftertaste
one
of
the
few
brews
worth
a
perfect
rating
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
carbonation
is
pretty
strong
on
this
one
the
whole
bouquet
of
flavors
really
sits
on
the
palette
the
body
is
pretty
light
and
the
finish
is
super
smooth
o
not
for
me
o
best
triple
to
date
need
to
try
more
offerings
from
this
brewery
overall
a
truly
unique
and
complex
brew
la
fin
du
monde
goes
down
as
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
of
all
time
o
alcoholic
but
smooth
for
9
abv
overall
a
delicate
but
powerful
tripel
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
billowing
white
head
on
top
the
foam
leaves
some
scattered
lacing
on
the
glass
with
each
sip
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
citrusy
and
has
some
sweet
grainy
aromas
too
in
there
the
beer
smells
refreshing
very
lively
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
little
spicy
a
little
fruity
and
had
a
nice
amount
of
bready
yeast
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
rather
easy
to
drink
even
for
a
strong
brew
like
this
one
overall
its
a
damn
good
brew
and
i
would
enjoy
this
one
again
someday
for
sure
overall
4
5
i
was
hoping
for
more
head
especially
from
a
tripel
in
a
tulip
glass
and
the
aromas
seemed
to
dissipate
too
quickly
especially
compared
to
the
fantastic
lingering
and
complex
mouthfeel
and
taste
of
the
beer
itself
this
is
a
fantastic
tripel
and
one
of
my
second
or
third
favorites
in
the
style
very
much
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
or
two
to
savor
o
a
great
beer
that
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
in
the
future
seriously
if
you
were
like
me
and
passed
on
this
beer
in
the
past
next
time
grab
a
bottle
maybe
two
o
a
good
brew
characteristics
of
the
yeast
rule
the
taste
and
nose
this
fits
the
bill
when
i
feel
like
a
solid
belgian
style
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
does
so
much
but
can
be
enjoyed
even
in
spite
of
its
complexity
without
thinking
it
just
tastes
so
good
with
thinking
there
is
a
lot
to
appreciate
o
excellent
beer
well
balanced
crispycreamy
beer
high
in
alcohol
that
makes
this
beer
even
more
interesting
floral
spicy
fruity
but
a
kick
of
nuts
poured
into
snifter
this
beer
a
bit
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
quickly
diminished
into
a
thin
skim
the
aroma
is
a
wonderfully
inviting
complex
mix
of
spicy
phenols
banana
bubble
gum
and
sweetness
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
nose
delivered
with
a
firm
prick
of
carbonation
a
mix
of
spicy
peppery
phenols
and
fruity
esters
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
flavor
lingers
nicely
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
appropriately
high
overall
fantastic
enough
said
o
a
fantastic
triple
to
be
sure
this
beer
has
great
characteristics
and
may
be
the
best
nonbelgian
triple
there
is
o
wonderful
my
first
tasting
of
la
fin
du
monde
as
well
as
my
first
review
i
think
ive
found
a
new
favorite
o
what
can
i
say
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
is
best
enjoyed
by
drinking
very
slowly
as
it
is
on
the
strong
side
sipping
beer
i
guess
its
definitely
a
quality
product
that
shines
in
its
complex
aroma
and
taste
a
must
try
for
all
the
beer
lovers
out
there
o
an
awesome
beer
i
like
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
and
the
awesome
nose
it
is
a
sipper
but
it
remains
drinkable
and
doesnt
exhaust
my
palate
a
beer
like
this
cannot
be
easy
to
make
but
im
glad
someone
has
figured
it
out
overall
smooth
regal
sipping
beer
take
your
time
like
its
the
end
of
the
world
unibroue
puts
a
lot
of
pride
in
every
batch
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
their
offerings
definitely
dont
have
to
be
a
snob
to
enjoy
this
i
bet
my
bigbeerdrinking
family
would
instantly
enjoy
this
too
12
oz
bottle
in
my
opinion
unibroue
is
one
of
the
top
10
breweries
in
north
america
this
beer
is
bears
this
out
it
pours
a
very
cloudy
pale
orange
body
cloudier
of
course
if
the
yeast
from
the
bottle
is
added
but
i
prefer
the
beer
without
the
conditioning
yeast
fruity
and
yeasty
aroma
with
lots
of
wheat
bubblegum
alcohol
and
pepper
intense
fruity
and
alcoholic
flavors
over
sweet
malt
spices
and
yeast
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
chewy
in
consistency
intense
fizzy
classic
unibroue
style
carbonation
a
very
nice
beer
the
flavor
and
consistency
is
always
high
97
m
soft
and
pillowy
i
have
also
aged
this
for
one
and
two
years
and
the
complexity
in
fruits
and
malts
develops
further
becoming
even
more
interesting
a
world
class
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
really
good
wheat
beer
with
fruity
notes
and
a
malty
finish
that
lingers
for
a
good
time
worth
seeking
out
and
i
probably
will
be
trying
this
one
again
o
other
than
mediocre
appearance
and
some
evidence
of
alcohol
la
fin
du
monde
strikes
me
as
a
great
interpretation
of
a
tripel
o
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
tripel
very
light
refreshing
crisp
and
clean
excellent
o
very
strong
beer
that
is
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
also
has
some
taste
that
i
cant
really
describe
kind
of
like
saison
style
beer
that
is
off
putting
to
me
i
would
have
it
with
a
dessert
if
i
were
to
have
it
again
o
dangerously
drinkable
at
9
o
good
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
overall
great
perfect
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
but
a
bit
hot
d
a
well
rounded
brew
good
example
of
the
style
the
taste
is
excellent
this
is
a
perfect
sipping
beer
although
the
drinkability
is
nice
the
alcohol
is
present
and
will
sneak
up
on
you
fast
just
another
impressive
offering
from
unibroue
overall
a
great
tasting
and
complex
brew
that
has
a
great
balance
of
sweet
fruits
and
spices
o
nice
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
overall
impression
this
had
a
complex
fruitiness
to
it
and
seemed
to
fit
the
tripel
style
nicely
it
was
pretty
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
which
was
only
noticeable
in
the
warmth
of
the
finish
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
complex
belgian
style
beer
however
while
i
appreciate
belgians
theyre
not
my
favorite
style
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
youll
really
like
this
beer
o
ive
had
this
beer
many
many
times
and
it
never
disappoints
it
is
widely
available
not
overly
expensive
perfect
by
itself
or
with
food
and
for
my
money
is
better
than
the
belgian
forerunners
of
the
style
tripel
karmeliet
st
bernadus
tripel
chimay
and
it
isnt
often
in
fact
it
is
damn
rare
for
a
north
american
brewery
to
pull
of
an
abbey
style
like
this
i
like
tripels
quite
a
bit
and
this
is
easily
my
favorite
the
praise
this
beer
gets
is
well
earned
due
to
all
of
that
and
trying
to
judge
for
style
i
dont
know
how
to
not
give
it
a
5
overall
o
a
fabulous
rendition
of
the
belgian
tripel
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
seek
out
again
o
a
great
beer
in
all
catergories
if
this
had
a
lower
abv
i
would
drink
it
constantly
o
this
has
become
a
favorite
of
mine
now
that
i
know
my
local
store
sells
it
for
2
less
than
delirium
tremens
ill
be
reaching
for
this
one
on
a
weekly
basis
o
an
enjoyable
lighter
beer
with
plenty
of
belgian
character
and
phenolic
notes
with
some
softer
hints
at
sweet
fruit
pours
a
hazy
bright
yellow
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
the
head
is
almost
mousselike
which
makes
me
happy
stone
fruit
aromas
with
lots
of
other
ester
and
banana
aromas
and
some
spicy
phenolic
notes
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
a
little
spicy
on
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
behind
that
a
nice
medium
body
with
a
really
creamy
mouthfeel
from
the
very
tightly
bound
carbonation
long
finish
with
that
characteristic
stale
read
subtle
hop
finish
that
i
look
for
in
a
belgian
beer
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
i
havent
had
in
a
few
years
and
almost
forgot
how
much
i
like
it
especially
when
you
consider
that
the
unibroue
beers
are
generally
pretty
well
priced
when
compared
with
a
lot
of
american
belgianstyle
beers
this
might
make
its
way
into
my
regular
rotation
o
this
is
my
first
unibroue
beer
and
one
of
the
better
tripels
i
have
gotten
to
try
they
arent
really
my
style
and
i
like
this
anyway
im
definitely
looking
forward
to
trying
the
others
from
the
taster
pack
o
who
doesnt
love
this
one
its
a
near
perfect
example
from
one
of
north
americas
best
brewers
i
love
how
they
stay
true
to
the
roots
of
this
fantastic
tripel
while
adding
a
riff
or
two
of
their
own
la
fin
du
monde
pours
a
darkened
goldenrod
almost
100
opaque
the
pure
white
head
only
rises
up
to
about
a
finger
and
a
half
in
height
before
very
slowly
collapsing
down
on
itself
lacing
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
though
the
nose
is
absolutely
textbook
tripel
its
redolent
of
apples
and
pears
and
white
pepper
and
clove
all
in
relatively
equal
mesasure
the
flavor
is
quite
simply
perfection
as
far
as
a
tripel
goes
theres
a
pale
fruit
sweetness
but
not
too
sweet
to
kick
things
off
and
its
where
the
apples
and
pears
from
the
aroma
come
in
the
pepper
and
clove
yeast
phenols
come
in
for
the
second
half
of
each
sip
and
its
all
held
together
by
a
subtle
warming
and
pleasant
touch
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
touch
off
to
me
i
dont
know
if
the
bodys
coming
across
as
too
heavy
or
the
carbonation
as
too
low
but
the
result
is
a
mouthfeel
thats
not
quite
as
light
and
bubbly
as
the
best
brewed
belgians
la
fin
du
monde
is
possibly
the
best
tasting
tripel
ive
ever
had
but
some
of
the
odds
and
ends
looks
and
mouthfeel
just
dont
quite
live
up
to
the
same
level
overall
prime
example
of
the
tripel
style
highly
acclaimed
for
good
reason
very
complex
yet
grounded
very
drinkable
prosit
cloudy
golden
color
with
thick
bubbly
head
doesnt
retain
well
the
aroma
of
the
spicy
belgian
yeast
and
sweet
malt
hit
me
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
bottle
and
is
magnificent
taste
is
very
balanced
and
compares
favorably
to
some
belgians
ive
had
mild
fruit
esters
compliment
the
sweet
creamy
malt
slightly
dry
finish
mild
pepper
notes
mouthfeel
is
luxuorious
and
carbonation
is
medium
to
high
standard
for
the
tripel
style
overall
this
is
the
best
canadian
beer
ive
ever
had
and
the
subsequently
the
best
from
unibroue
o
a
fantastic
beer
and
a
classic
in
the
style
for
sure
dangerously
drinkable
for
being
9
but
probably
not
a
beer
i
want
to
have
multiple
of
in
a
night
a
nice
sipping
beer
or
one
to
pair
with
a
meal
o
a
great
triple
great
for
the
style
overall
solid
tripel
if
you
are
from
belgium
and
speak
dutch
op
uw
gezondheid
if
you
speak
francois
a
votre
sante
and
for
you
lazy
buggers
gosh
darn
you
get
on
my
nerves
sometimes
its
cheers
or
as
ored
likes
to
say
raise
your
glass
id
tap
that
drinkable
yes
but
alot
going
on
here
with
the
spice
malts
and
alcohol
enjoy
all
unibroue
beers
should
be
tried
at
least
twice
o
delicious
beer
very
enjoyable
to
drink
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
beer
its
spiciness
is
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
night
but
it
is
still
crisp
so
it
is
refreshing
enough
for
a
scorching
summer
night
i
recently
was
served
this
at
a
beer
tasting
and
it
was
good
even
in
a
little
3oz
glasss
and
stood
up
to
the
other
beers
on
the
menu
overall
a
tremendously
good
beer
i
remember
while
i
was
a
university
student
in
montreal
people
used
to
talk
about
how
terrible
this
beer
was
not
la
terrible
neither
i
nor
any
of
my
friends
knew
anything
about
beer
at
the
time
cant
believe
what
i
was
missing
out
on
those
years
o
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
the
flavors
are
robust
and
complex
with
no
hint
of
the
9
abv
flavor
is
the
key
to
this
one
its
packed
with
flavor
this
is
not
a
gateway
beer
and
is
meant
for
the
more
seasoned
beer
drinker
o
overall
fantastic
it
is
the
best
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
allinall
one
of
a
handful
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
this
is
why
i
love
craft
beer
overall
i
was
incredibly
impressed
with
this
juicy
and
delicious
beer
and
its
always
nice
to
have
one
of
those
eureka
moments
when
it
dawns
on
you
that
youre
smelling
something
so
ludicrously
awesome
as
captain
crunch
in
a
beer
o
a
fantastic
tripel
and
an
amazing
beer
all
around
also
a
fair
amount
cheaper
than
an
actual
belgian
tripel
import
about
half
as
expensive
at
my
local
store
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
is
extraordinarily
good
overalli
again
cannot
emphasize
enough
how
refreshing
this
beer
is
given
the
strength
and
style
this
beer
is
absolutely
exceptional
the
only
things
that
i
can
think
to
improve
upon
would
be
simply
matters
of
personal
taste
as
far
as
that
goes
i
like
a
tripel
with
a
very
strong
spice
presence
in
the
nose
which
is
a
tad
lacking
here
but
again
that
is
no
reflection
upon
this
beer
but
my
own
personal
taste
this
beer
is
an
absolute
musttry
nearly
perfect
overall
great
tripel
i
would
love
to
see
a
bit
more
complexity
and
less
carbonation
but
a
great
goto
tripel
o
given
that
a
six
pack
is
down
the
street
and
fairly
priced
this
is
a
beer
i
will
have
the
pleasure
of
tasting
many
many
more
times
a
superb
tripel
overall
great
triple
very
enjoyable
o
a
delicious
beer
i
havent
had
a
good
belgian
style
in
a
while
and
this
was
the
perfect
beer
to
fill
the
void
everyone
needs
to
try
this
beer
my
favorite
for
the
style
hands
down
drink
45
super
tasty
and
very
drinkable
its
dangerous
because
of
it
o
a
very
impressive
tripel
no
doubt
about
it
the
alcohol
is
hidden
wonderfully
and
all
the
fruit
going
on
with
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
just
plain
excellent
worthy
of
the
high
praise
and
would
buy
again
for
sure
overall
i
love
this
beer
it
emulates
a
duvel
at
a
relatively
more
modest
price
point
and
with
an
infinitely
broader
availability
its
around
enough
to
encourage
you
to
drink
it
willy
nilly
but
it
will
catch
up
to
you
ive
met
weaker
wines
than
this
strong
boy
perfect
when
you
want
one
before
bed
or
something
to
stand
up
to
a
steak
or
even
a
cigar
njoy
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
belgians
ive
ever
had
it
is
frickin
beautiful
stellar
example
of
this
style
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
a
great
bottle
list
of
belgian
styled
beers
at
a
french
restaurant
i
had
this
paired
with
some
garlic
and
scallion
muscles
and
it
was
perfect
i
couldnt
have
asked
for
more
o
i
have
had
this
beer
quite
a
few
times
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
was
shocked
to
see
that
i
had
not
rated
it
this
is
an
amazing
beer
that
defines
rather
than
represents
a
tripel
it
has
a
great
color
and
a
large
head
wonderful
complex
aromas
and
flavors
nice
body
and
balanced
use
of
alcohol
i
really
enjoy
the
earthy
flavors
that
add
another
dimension
to
this
brew
it
is
called
world
class
and
it
deserves
that
title
overall
ill
be
drinking
more
of
these
pours
out
a
light
gold
color
slightly
hazy
texture
with
a
light
head
maybe
a
half
finger
pretty
good
head
retention
as
well
smell
is
very
light
some
minor
hint
of
floral
hops
and
light
malts
taste
has
some
light
malt
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
hint
of
hop
bite
mouthfeel
has
a
comfortable
thickness
to
it
slightly
reminiscent
of
the
texture
of
a
light
hefeweissen
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
without
the
overpowering
belgian
funk
that
one
gets
with
the
belgian
yeasts
also
hides
the
higher
abv
well
definitely
a
must
try
its
still
a
very
good
beer

tastes

some

this

a

that
i

a

more
of
it

any

not

nothing

it

full
of

excellent

with
hundreds
of

the

sparkling
wine
scent
it
settles
as
a
cloudy
light
amber
concoction
resembling
a
wit
yet
we
all
know
better
a
full
bodied
tripel
with
a
taste
almost
as
tempting
as
an
authentic
trappist
ale
very
sweet
lacking
the
tang
of

buy
again
and
again
notes
a

with

even
my

it
is

a
foam
on
the
top
very
fruity
smelling
with
a
bit
of
tartness
as
for
flavor
im
not
a
huge
tripel
guy
but
this
will
be
my
go
to
as
a
change
from
my
normal
heavier
beers
the
taste
is
very
complex
with
many
maltyfruity
flavors
alcohol
is
dangerously
hidded
you
want
to
chug
it
but
itll
hit
you
if
you
do
i
didnt
notice
an
alcohol
flavor
until
i
would
breathe
in
after
swallowing
a
mouthful
as
it
warms
more
pepper
shows
itself
the
mouthfeel
is
what
really
gets
you
with
this
one
very
creamy
feel
great
beer
you
just
want
to
keep
drinking
this
one
but
have
to
be
careful
due
to
the
9
that
i
felt
immediately
but
didnt
really
taste
you
have
to
remind
yourself
to
slow
down
and
really
savor
this
one
great
beer
especially
considering
the
priceavailability
this
is
beer
is
tasty
and
feels
good
going
down
it
hits
you
like
a
brick
so
be
careful
as
it
is
9
abv
please
dont
chug
this
beer
you
will
be
a
disgrace
it
is
unibroues
best
beer
although
whichever
one
i
am
drinking
at
the
time
is
my
favorite
definitely
give
this
beer
a
try

such

this
is
my
standard
triple
i
havent
had
anything
yet
thats
its
equal
nothing
about
it
is
overpowering
you
really
can
enjoy
everything
it
has
to
offer
world
class
a
must
try
for
a
craft
beer
drinker
d
great
drinkability
i
had
a
few
friends
who
had
tried
this
and
didnt
like
it
not
sure
what
they
were
tasting
this
is
an
amazing
beer
for
the
abv
it
is
very
drinkable
no
alcohol
taste
or
burn
in
the
least
balance
between
the
malts
and
fruits
make
this
a
very
easy
drink

typical
for
a
unibroue
ale
somewhat
of
a
honeysuckle
smell
has
a
semi
hefe
weissen
unflitered
look
to
it
with
high

initially
with
the
carbonation
definitely
noticeable
slightly
bitter
and
tart
defined
spice
and
floral
notes
light

a

after
the
initial

a
solid

id
rate
it
an
a
not

good

abv
la
fin
du
monde
is
the
beer
that
first
got
me
into
drinking
craft
and
i
wanted
to
give
it
justice
in
my
review
because
it
is
a
very
worthy
example
and
is
quite
deserving
of
all
the
accolades
even
now
its
just
as
good
as
i
remember
it
was
the
first
time
around
thats
the
mark
of
a
great
brew
side
note
i
first
tried
this
beer
about
maybe
10
years
ago
while
on
a
ski
trip
in
quebec
i
picked
it
up
at
a
small
package
store
just
outside
the
tiny
town
of
magog
the
only
reason
i
bought
it
was
because
i
like
the
label
of
the
bottle
i
placed
this
outside
of
my
hotel
balcony
in
the
snow
and
drank
it
right
from
the
bottle
ice
cold
immediately
this
became
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
did
not
realize
it
was
available
in
my
area
until
a
few
years
ago
d
i
could
maybe
take
two
of
these
bad
boys
in
one
sitting
the
malt
sweetness
combined
with
the
distinct
yeast
note
fills
you
up
d
one
does
not
even
perceive
this
as
a
9
beer
very
deceptive
a
very
good
beer
that
one
could
conceivably
match
with
a
variety
of
food
pairings
d
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
at
9
which
is
why
i
suggest
you
dont
pound
4
packs
of
them
on
a
regular
basis
you
can
feel
this
stuff
after
one
but
keep
em
coming
for
me
d
a
nice
offering
drinks
very
easy
this
is
definitely
a
gateway
beer
i
will
suggest
this
to
my
bmc
schwag
drinking
buddies
d
this
is
good
stuff
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
but
certainly
well
enjoyed
on
occasion
this
is
a
decent
tripel
but
not
one
of
the
best
ive
had
having
just
had
the
westmalle
tripel
tonight
this
doesnt
quite
measure
up
its
really
sweet
and
less
balanced
than
the
best
in
the
style

would
have
it
again

not

good

of

seem
to
have
some
lingering

a

beer
no
matter
how
you
have
it
ive
had
the
750ml
bottles
and
the
12
oz
the
latter
i
dont
think
is
bottle
conditioned
because
there
isnt
any
sediment
so
the
flavors
are
clear
and
bright
sweet
and
sour
in
the
larger
bottle
conditioned
beer
the
flavors
are
more
subtle
with
robust
carbonation
a
great
beer

definitely
not

helps
d

even
as

i
like
the
level

one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
to
me
the
gold
standard
in
tripels
one
i
will
seriously
miss
as
long
as
i

no

d
a

just
a
dissapointment
probably
wouldnt
drink
again

combining
the

all

abv
very
well
love
the
taste
and
pretty
much
every
thing
about
this
beer
im
pretty
sure
that
this
was
my
first
craft
beer
i
remember
acquiring
a
bottle
when
i
was
18
fresh
in
college
just
because
of
the
alcohol
content
well
i
wasnt
ready
then
i
remember
just
trying
to
get
it
down
times
have
changed
and
im
glad
i
can
enjoy
it
now
for
all
the
right
reasons
tastes
great
remarkably
well
combined
flavors
of
citrus
clove
like
spices
goes
down
really
smooth
no
suggestions
of
a
9
abv
carbonation
is
right
where
id
like
it
to
be
id
drink
this
almost
any
time
of
year
in
almost
any
setting
this
may
be
the
best
tripel
ive
ever
had
id
definitely
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
something
both
flavorful
and
refreshing
for
around
11
for
a
4
pack
those
around
me
enjoyed
this
beer
as
well
excellent
beer
a
must
have
on
hand
year
round
really
a
fantastic
beer
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
well
reviewed
absolutely
one
of
my
favorite
belgianstyle
beers
wife
even
likes
this
it
d
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
keeps
you
warm
from
the
first
sip
a
wonderful
sipper
my
first
unibroue
beer
and
one
that
i
will
buy
again
highly
recommend
edit
as
the
beer
warms
and
some
of
the
carbonation
dissipates
the
beer
becomes
much
more
pleasurable
and
boozy
this
only
confirms
that
this
would
be
splendid
drawn
from
a
cask
this
is
utterly
fantastic
a
good
tripel
from
canada
this
is
just
a
great
beer
tons
of
traditional
flavor
characteristics
for
the
style
and
far
too
easy
to
drink
ive
had
this
beer
numerous
times
now
and
i
always
feel
like
i
could
drink
several
bottles
in
a
row
though
the
9
abv
might
make
that
difficult
theres
really
almost
nothing
in
this
beer
that
could
be
improved
upon
and
at
less
than
three
dollars
a
bottle
its
an
absolute
steal
a
true
gem
of
the
beer
world
a
wonderful
belgian
and
probably
my
favorite
from
unibroue
though
the
robust
flavor
usually
leaves
me
satisfied
at
just
one
for
the
price
we
will
enjoy
this
one
again

brings
you
back

will
render
you
incapable

taking
the

of
notes
d
la
fin
du

is
the
most
solid
offering
from
unibroues
standard
line
up
and
was
one
of
my
original
craft
standbys
i
remember
marveling
at
the
price
7
for
a
bottle
of
beer
the
abv
holy
shit
this
is
like
2
drinks
in
one
and
how
after
only
two
beers
id
be
walking
crooked
back
to
my
apartment
nowadays
after
two
i
just
sit
crooked
in
my
house
drinkability
very
strong
example
of
a
tripel
which
i
could
certainly
have
many
more
times
howeverthe
body
slightly
misses
the
mark
for
me
and
i
could
have
used
a
touch
more
hops
and
a
touch
less
clove
these
are
minor
gripes
simply
explaining
why
this
is
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
ive
had
this
a
few
times
time
for
a
review
12

pour
this

easy
the
head
builds
up
crazy
fast
fluffy
pillow
of
white
head
stays
at
2
fingers
for
a
while
a
cap
covers
it
the
whole
time
leaving
good
lacing
lots
of
peppery
yeast
and
light
fruits
in
the
nose
apple
peach
a
little
grassy
definitely
let
this
sit
for
a
few
minutes
before
sipping
or
the
carbonation
will
kill
you
the
peppery
yeast
and
spice
is
very
upfront
in
the
taste
which
may
turn
some
people
off
but
i
like
it
many
great
flavors
are
there
such
as
clove
green
apple
banana
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
feel
which
seems
common
in
tripels
ive
had
there
is
a
nice
subtle
sugary
sweetness
booze
is
a
little
hot
at
first
but
nearly
disappears
after
some
time
great
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
good
the
extreme
carbonation
dies
down
after
a
few
minutes
like
a
good
tripel
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
very
easy
to
drink
12
oz
is
not
enough
750ml
is
a
perfect
amount
for
this
good
price
for
the
quality
excellent
stuff
but
i
think
allagash
tripel
remains
my
favorite
for
the
style
notes
my
first
tripel
was
victorys
golden
monkey
which
i
wont
ever
be
buying
again
this
is
because
the
combination
of
unibroues
availability
price
and
sheer
quality
a
reflection
of
exceptional
craftsmanship
cannot
be
overstated
and
are
simply
unbeatable
though
i
know
there
are
probably
superior
belgian
tripels
out
there
i
also
know
i
wont
be
able
to
help
measuring
other
examples
against
this
outstanding
specimen
750ml
cork
and
caged
best
by
date
of
91712
poured
into
a
chalice
a
pale
golden
straw
colour
white
and
thin
foamy
head
that
doesnt
cling
well
to
the
sides
never
ending
stream
of
bubbles
rise
from
the
etching
great
looking
brew
smells
of
bananas
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
seems
to
have
a
spicy
nose
to
it
more
complexities
that
i
cant
seem
to
filter
out
overall
a
very
pleasing
scent
comes
with
this
brew
taste
is
great
has
that
hint
of
banana
and
clove
truly
appetizing
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
follows
up
but
is
a
bit
difficult
to
detect
possibly
making
this
brew
a
dangerous
one
triple
fermentation
process
gives
this
a
nice
tingly
feel
on
the
palate
though
it
is
ultra
smooth
on
the
way
down
this
could
be
the
end
of
the
world
if
consumed
unwisely
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
unbelievably
high
especially
for
an
ale
of
this
strength
two
bottles
of
this
wouldnt
seem
unreasonable
until
after
you
finished
the
second
then
you
may
wish
the
world
was
ending
but
who
knows
about
that
ive
only
consumed
one
bottle
my
world
seems
to
be
fine
right
about
now
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
had
a
unibroue
brew
i
think
i
shall
give
there
other
selections
a
whirl
d
first
unibroue
ive
ever
had
and
this
one
had
a
lot
of
hype
surrounding
it
id
have
to
say
it
lived
up
and
i
will
gladly
buy
this
again
very
tasty
cheers
i
didnt
know
what
to
really
expect
with
this
one
as
it
is
my
introduction
to
the
style
but
i
am
blown
away
by
it
unbelievable
beer
d
moderate
to
low
drinkability
alcohol
is
pretty
zingy
but
the
surprisingly
not
filling
at
all
against
the
carbonation
of
the
beer
the
sniffing
session
reveals
intense
and
complex
aromas
of
citruses
mainly
orange
banana
and
bubble
gum
which
is
not
surprising
as
wheat
is
one
of
the
principal
ingredients
clove
faint
pepperiness
refined
sugar
and
perceivable
alcohol
the
sweet
malty
body
with
clovey
phenolic
character
embraces
intense
citrusy
esters
which
whip
the
palate
with
bites
of
orange
alcohol
clearly
shows
itself
bitter
ending
probably
due
to
abundance
of
yeast
derived
phenolics
the
medium
body
is
crispy
but
this
is
somehow
balanced
by
wheaty
texture
of
the
beer
that
tends
to
create
dextrinous
coatings
on
the
lips
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
overpowering
and
somehow
not
well
incorporated
into
the
whole
thus
reducing
the
drinkability
a
good
brew
nevertheless
a
little
spicy
but
what
i
didnt
enjoy
the
high
amount
of
yeast
in
this
one
light
fruit
tones
and
a
slight
bit
of
citrus
nothing
big
though
the
light
body
made
this
different
from
most
tripels
i
enjoyed
but
it
was
an
overall
enjoyable
drink
d
very
drinkable
and
smooth
with
very
little
alcohol
warmth
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
delicious
very
nice
offering
la
fin
du
monde
is
the
best
nonbelgian
tripel
i
have
had
to
date
my
first
unibroue
beer
and
one
that
i
will
buy
again
recommended
md
carbonation
sweetness
and
thickness
are
all
on
the
high
end
but
balance
each
other
nicely
end
result
is
that
it
feels
a
bit
foamy
alcohol
mildly
apparent
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
d
well
you
cant
drink
it
that
fast
being
a
beer
of
bold
upfront
flavors
but
taken
as
a
sipping
beer
its
one
you
can
just
sit
back
and
relax
with
d
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
super
amazing
on
a
hot
day
with
some
light
cheeses
or
fruits
this
was
an
extremely
good
beer
i
wish
i
got
to
drink
it
at
home
to
enjoy
it
properly
instead
of
being
out
with
non
craft
beer
drinkers
the
last
part
of
my
notes
says
abv
snuck
up
on
me
lol
can
be
enjoyed
strait
up
alone
or
with
anything
you
wish
to
cut
with
the
dryness
of
a
tripel
to
be
savored
sipped
highly
recommended
if
you
want
to
see
what
a
great
tripel
is
all
about
mediumfull
bodied
smooth
creamy
with
mild
carbonation
big
frothy
white
head
atop
a
cloudy
golden
straw
yellow
out
of
a
750
maybe
its
just
the
warming
weather
but
i
get
vanilla
ice
cream
and
hints
of
orange
sherbert
right
of
the
bat
its
also
got
a
touch
of
caramel
banana
and
clove
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
only
better
it
was
also
missing
the
orange
peppery
and
spicy
vanilla
followed
by
sweet
caramel
cloves
tend
to
be
more
relevant
here
as
well
some
warming
alcohol
but
the
vanilla
really
plays
well
with
that
aspect
very
smooth
and
creamy
i
did
prefer
this
when
it
was
on
the
cooler
side
but
all
in
all
it
was
very
good
cheers
the
palate
is
surprisingly
tame
given
how
incredible
the
nose
is
opening
with
a
light
crackerlike
sweetness
with
some
sugar
and
honey
theres
a
delicate
ripe
orange
character
some
mild
floral
notes
as
well
moderately
yeasty
this
really
reminds
me
of
rising
bread
this
character
is
especially
noticeable
midpalate
along
with
some
phenols
spices
are
present
as
well
with
a
blend
of
clove
and
white
pepper
bigger
in
body
than
i
like
for
the
style
i
love
em
bone
dry
this
beer
is
mediumlight
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
it
also
doesnt
seem
as
wellknit
as
it
could
be
the
finish
is
quite
excellent
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
fruit
spice
and
yeast
very
drinkable
stuff
this
also
very
delicate
and
needs
to
be
consumed
on
a
clean
palate
d
very
drinkable
but
just
short
of
absolute
smoothness
high
abv
is
hidden
extremely
well
though
notes
this
goes
down
real
easy
for
a
high
gravity
brew
i
shared
this
bottle
with
a
friend
and
we
finished
it
a
lot
faster
than
i
expected
and
were
kinda
tipsy
towards
the
end
respect
the
brew
as
they
say
overall
a
good
beer
well
balanced
and
tasty
also
i
would
suggest
this
as
a
good
beer
for
the
craft
brew
fan
who
is
uninitiated
into
the
world
of
belgian
style
beers
in
my
top
three
beers
of
all
time
la
fin
du
monde
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
with
a
lively
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
light
and
fruity
with
plenty
of
yeasty
phenolic
character
and
some
alcohol
coming
through
the
flavor
is
sharp
and
sweet
upfront
lots
of
light
faintly
tropical
fruitiness
the
sharp
phenolic
flavor
sticks
around
and
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
alcohol
flavor
comes
through
but
its
mild
for
the
strength
not
only
is
this
a
great
beer
but
i
think
its
the
best
value
in
ontario
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
gives
the
impression
that
the
flavors
dance
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
for
being
9
percent
d
a
very
nice
tripel
great
fruity
smell
and
taste
and
the
high
abv
doesnt
affect
the
drinkability
at
all
a
great
beer
by
unibroue
that
ive
had
many
times
and
will
surely
have
again
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
foil
on
top
and
freshness
date
on
the
back
of
the
label
golden
copper
color
with
3
inches
of
head
that
retains
very
well
scents
of
cloves
fresh
cut
apples
and
grapes
lots
of
dry
fruit
flavor
yeast
esters
are
tastey
alcohol
is
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
going
very
well
with
gourmet
grilled
cheese
with
basil
it
was
this
orangyyellow
color
it
smelled
great
a
sorta
fruity
taste
it
had
a
big
head
on
it
the
bottle
has
this
fancy
silver
foil
that
envelops
the
cap
giving
this
brew
a
regal
air
i
originally
got
this
as
part
of
their
variety
pack
coulda
done
without
that
apple
flavored
stuff
though
pours
cloudy
a
gold
that
is
slightly
orange
in
the
heart
of
the
glass
the
nice
white
fluffy
head
has
very
nice
retention
and
good
lacing
strong
belgian
yeast
aroma
sweet
clove
white
pepper
apple
and
perhaps
a
little
banana
the
flavor
has
a
surprising
tart
sour
apple
zing
to
it
that
makes
this
beer
quite
refreshing
plenty
of
clove
pear
and
apple
meld
with
sweet
pale
malt
alcohol
is
perceivable
but
does
not
take
away
from
the
beers
flavor
flavors
added
by
the
yeast
seem
to
be
the
star
of
the
show
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
that
lends
to
a
luxuriously
effervescent
mouthfeel
finish
is
tart
and
dry
this
beer
is
refreshing
but
i
would
not
necessarily
say
it
is
remarkably
drinkable
a
very
well
made
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
this
beer
poured
into
a
brooklyn
brewery
tulip
a
beautiful
hazy
yellow
amber
with
an
amazing
3
finger
width
white
head
there
were
lots
of
bubbles
seen
and
remained
active
for
most
of
the
beers
life
the
head
took
quite
a
while
to
dissipate
and
eventually
did
so
to
a
one
finger
width
thickness
the
lacing
on
the
glass
was
thick
and
clung
to
the
glass
up
until
time
to
wash
the
glass
the
initial
smell
of
this
brew
was
that
of
fruits
champagne
and
slight
hint
of
alcohol
the
initial
taste
was
that
of
fruits
malt
champagne
and
some
possible
floral
notes
the
beer
had
a
light
to
medium
body
with
a
nice
bite
of
the
carbonation
and
actually
felt
quite
strange
on
the
tongue
strange
good
to
me
even
after
it
had
been
swallowed
what
really
knocked
my
socks
off
with
this
beer
was
its
presentation
and
mouth
feel
absolutely
fantastic
beer
and
one
that
could
get
none
beer
drinkers
a
second
thought
about
the
realm
of
craft
beers
will
definitely
buy
this
againalways
be
stocked
with
this
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
highly
recommended
d
i
feel
that
is
has
a
very
high
drinkability
which
is
bad
because
the
alcohol
will
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
and
crush
you
could
easily
put
this
beer
down
in
a
few
minutes
although
i
would
recommend
not
too
la
fin
du
monde
is
quite
simply
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
made
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
my
whole
bomber
was
gone
in
about
20
minutes
sweet
and
slightly
spicy
with
a
smooth
finish
and
a
looker
to
boot
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
try
and
maybe
one
to
make
your
top
whatever
list
if
youre
a
big
belgian
fan
good
stuff
canada
slightly
sweet
cakelike
smell
with
subtle
funky
yeast
certainly
not
overpowering
great
mouthfeel
coats
the
palate
and
roof
of
mouth
hell
i
even
feel
it
coating
my
teeth
the
lingering
taste
is
very
nice
seems
a
bit
thin
overall
though
causing
the
alcohol
to
stand
out
a
shade
more
but
very
solid
nonetheless
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
a
challenge
to
describe
so
it
gets
bonus
points
for
confounding
the
senses
the
high
abv
shouldnt
turn
anyone
off
as
it
is
very
well
balanced
with
flavors
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
luscious
not
thick
or
syrupy
very
refreshing
fluffy
and
velvety
on
the
palette
glad
to
have
these
readibly
available
in
my
area
verdict
a
thoroughly
satisfying
experience
la
fin
du
monde
is
complex
delicate
and
well
balanced
who
knew
the
canadians
were
crafting
such
great
belgian
beers
this
whole
time
pours
a
lightyellow
cider
color
with
a
very
healthy
foamy
white
head
aroma
has
a
mix
of
apple
some
citrus
and
floral
hints
to
it
taste
is
a
mix
of
apples
spice
and
some
malts
alcohol
is
there
also
but
not
too
strong
which
is
surprising
considering
its
9
abv
good
thickness
and
carbonation
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
for
any
occassion
but
pricey
overall
la
fin
du
monde
is
a
undoubtedly
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
but
it
lacks
a
certain
something
that
is
present
in
any
other
belgian
tripel
its
still
however
a
refreshing
and
interesting
beer
that
is
heavy
on
the
fruit
tastes
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
body
with
a
medium
sized
fizzy
head
aromas
are
herbal
and
fruity
with
most
of
the
aroma
being
the
latter
taste
is
fruity
citrus
with
some
subtle
spicy
notes
some
malt
sweetness
as
well
leaves
a
bit
of
a
fruity
aftertaste
which
only
left
me
wanting
more
cool
bottle
as
always
with
unibroue
9
alcohol
cant
tell
well
done
eh
go

maf
drinkability
this
is
also
deceptively
drinkable
i
have
to
remind
myself
to
sip
it
because
it
is
in
fact
so
light
you
have
to
be
careful
though
because
it
packs
a
hidden
punch
altogether
one
of
my
favorite
beers
d
hides
the
alcohol
pretty
well
although
i
still
feel
it
this
is
a
refreshing
drink
but
i
still
found
the
25
oz
serving
to
be
pretty
filling

d
a
nice
drinkable
beer
for
a
strong
triple
very
good
for
the
style
one
750ml
bottle
over
an
evening
with
friends
with
perfect
drinkability
awesome
sip
the
goodness
superb
you
can
stock
up
on
this
one
overall
one
of
the
best
triples
i
had
and
i
only
had
a
few
a
quality
beer
for
sure
i
had
read
the
hype
and
since
im
all
about
tripels
now
i
had
to
try
it
allagashs
tripel
is
my
new
favorite
beer
but
i
wanted
to
see
how
this
one
stacks
up
i
wasnt
disapointed
much
the
beer
looked
terrific
a
solid
golden
haze
with
a
nice
tall
head
and
tons
of
lacing
promising
well
that
faded
as
i
smelled
the
beer
and
i
must
say
i
couldnt
stand
they
way
this
one
smelled
something
was
strange
it
was
a
spicy
tripel
smell
but
a
bit
too
unpleasant
for
me
maybe
too
strong
i
dunno
what
the
problem
was
the
taste
was
outstanding
second
only
to
allagashs
a
bit
more
apple
in
the
taste
in
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
super
drinkable
with
the
exception
of
the
smell
this
beer
was
about
perfect
but
because
i
didnt
care
for
the
smell
i
gotta
put
his
one
as
the
2nd
best
tripel
out
there
highly
recommended
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
can
appreciate
it
its
amazing
for
what
it
is
and
at
an
excellent
price
point
overall
this
is
a
great
tripel
its
light
sweetened
taste
masks
the
hefty
alcohol
when
i
first
bought
this
beer
at
the
store
i
thought
it
would
have
a
very
strong
taste
due
to
the
high
alchool
content
wrong
this
beer
is
like
a
leffe
blond
but
40x
better
it
is
a
bit
sweet
nice
smell
good
carbonation
this
is
simply
a
wonderful
beer
to
have
warning
do
not
drink
it
too
fast
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend

3
of
these
and
id
be
done
for
sure
all
in
all
this
brew
disappointed
me
if
you
like
a
refreshing
beer
comparable
to
sparkling
water
then
this
is
for
you
if
you
like
heavy
hops
or
malts
then
this
one
might
not
be
for
you
good
to
try
at
least
once
to
give
it
a
chance
but
otherwise
i
do
not
recommend
overall
this
was
amazingly
drinkable
refreshing
and
wonderful
a
great
beer
such
a
smooth
beer
glad
to
have
tried
it
will
definately
try
again
d
dangerously
drinkable
one
of
this
beers
best
attributes
in
my
opinion
is
that
there
is
absolutely
no
trace
of
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
j
notes
this
beer
is
world
class
and
very
accessible
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
two
finger
frothy
white
head
with
impressive
lace
smells
pungent
and
tart
fruit
ginger
cloves
and
spices
especially

taste
is
lively
with
champagne
carbonation
coriander
sweet
honey
yeasty
and
grainy
citrus
lemon
with
an
amazing
hop
backround
one
of
the
best

ive
had
to
date
an
excellent
tripel
maybe
one
of
the
top
3
brewed
in
the
world
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
am
so
glad
this
is
so
widely
avaliable
and
i
can
even
get
it
at
my
local
grocery
store
i
have
had
this
many
times
and
plan
on
having
it
many
more
very
refreshing
beer
and
you
dont
notice
the
9
one
bit
drinkability
very
easy
going
down
for
the
alcohol
content
you
would
never
realize
this
is
a
9
brew
note
this
beer
has
enough
flavor
to
goes
great
with
a
wide
range
of
heavier
foods
and
is
sophisticated
enough
to
have
with
lighter
fare
as
well
pours
a
hazy
and
pale
blonde
color
with
a
creamy
two
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
estery
banana
scents
too
the
body
is
creamy
and
flows
smoothly
with
banana
flavors
backed
by
a
semi
tart
maltiness
the
finish
fades
slowly
and
tastes
sweet
as
it
ends
it
leaves
a
lingering
but
subtle
tartness
d
nah
ill
pass
give
one
to
the
alstroms
md
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
good
beer
perhaps
a
little
bit
too
spicy
quite
different
from
the
belgian
tripels
ive
tasted
strong
unibroue
character
12
oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
bottle
has
a
best
by
date
of
070912
pours
a
rich
orange
color
with
a
moderate
head
but
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
are
very
muted
but
spicy
yeast
apples
and
a
touch
of
pine
are
present
tastes
are
spot
on
for
a
tripel
plenty
of
sweetness
but
a
very
good
balance
between
hops
and
malt
really
not
able
to
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
dry
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
this
one
is
dangerous
at
9
abv
but
its
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
great
beer
good
price
drinkability
lacks
the
complexity
that
would
normally
keep
my
interest
very
balanced
and
manageable
9
abv
this
beer
is
never
a
bad
choice
drinkability
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
more
than
i
was
expecting
i
think
it
was
because
it
didnt
have
that
strong
belgian
yeast
flavor
not
that
i
dislike
that
flavor
i
just
like
when
its
more
mellow
notes
this
was
my
first
non
belgian
tripel
its
all
most
perfect
it
has
a
best
by
date
of
1212
so
im
assuming
its
really
fresh
medium
bodied
the
beer
is
silky
in
the
mouth
and
finishes
with
a
nice
bitterness
there
is
a
lot
of
yeast
and
esters
playing
in
the
mouth
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
good
tripel
this
is
one
of
my
standby
beers
consistently
wonderful
d
this
wasnt
1
of
my
favorite
unibroue
beers
but
my
palate
must
of
changed
because
im
really
enjoying
this
one
glad
unibroue
is
canadian
great
beer
at
a
decent
price
tonight
i
saw
a
mixed
eight
pack
of
unibroue
ales
i
will
be
trying
them
soon
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
recedes
to
a
very
white
ring
with
some
sticky
clingy
lacing
the
smell
is
pears
apples
bananas
and
clove
with
some
fresh
bread
and
yeast
the
taste
is
the
same
lots
of
fruit
mixed
with
clove
and
some
spices
some
bread
and
malt
and
yeast
this
is
a
flavorful
tripel
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
highly
drinkable
9
its
one
i
can
drink
several
times
in
a
week
between
my
other
favorites
defintely
something
ill
return
to
when
im
in
the
mood
for
belgian
tripel
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
belgians
go
buy
this
beer
simply
amazing
it
is
one
of
my
many
favorites
around
here
in
montreal
mouthfeel
is
slightly
complex
and
full
bodied
for
a
belgian
tripel
carbonation
is
perfect
this
beer
is
definitely
a
room
temp
beer
wonderful
m
d
buttery
velvety
quality
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
this
one
goes
great
with
spicy
food
and
is
strong
enough
to
put
a
cap
on
consumption
definitely
falls
into
the
buy
again
category
honestly
its
a
bit
of
a
bargain
compared
to
comparable
tripels
from
belgium
after
having
most
of
their
major
products
its
seems
that
unibroue
cranks
out
quality
thats
on
par
with
ommengang
offerings
both
offering
widely
available
belgian
style
beers
especially
here
in
the
midatlantic
states
m
loose
and
fluffy
with
a
slight
tang
on
the
tongue
deff
a
one
and
done
for
me
high
carbonation
and
noticeable
alcohol
assertiveness
coupled
with
a
flavor
that
doesnt
quite
hold
the
palates
attention
leads
to
reduced
drinkability
personally
i
feel
this
beer
would
have
been
highly
drinkable
if
it
had
a
lower
abv
as
it
stands
this
beer
is
a
one
and
done
either
in
the
beginning
or
end
of
a
beer
series
this
is
one
of
the
best
offerings
by
unibroue
and
i
feel
it
is
a
world
class
tripel
and
by
far
one
of
the
breweries
top
offerings
drinkability
it
was
really
good
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
dfirst
review
and
first
time
trying
this
style
amazed
at
how
the
alcohol
stays
hidden
this
is
a
great
big
beer
that
requires
respect
the
body
is
light
and
silky
with
heavy
carbonation
and
a
lingering
crispness
the
light
body
and
mouthfeel
help
to
hide
the
alcohol
content
well
pours
clear
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
some
fruity
characters
this
is
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
tripel
the
taste
is
lots
of
fruit
with
belgian
yeast
you
get
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
as
well
the
fruit
is
apples
and
white
grapes
as
well
as
possibly
some
citrus
thin
bodied
and
medium
to
high
carbonation
finishes
very
dry
and
excellent
tasteand
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
tripel
d
this
is
one
of
the
first
tripels
ive
really
enjoyed
good
solid
belgian
yeast
character
and
a
fruitiness
and
sweetness
that
is
well
balanced
the
only
knock
on
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
comes
from
the
alcohol
but
still
easy
to
drink
i
drank
em
out
of
tulips
pours
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
smells
of
belgian
yeast
cloves
fruits
kinda
appleish
feels
good
to
the
mouth
with
very
adequate
carbonation
the
9
is
hidden
very
well
and
i
think
keeping
these
has
really
no
major
positive
or
negatives
at
least
that
i
experienced
in
the
8
months
this
stuff
is
really
great
and
a
good
price
so
i
will
most
defiantly
be
buying
again
in
the
future
overall
probably
the
best
tasting
triple
i
have
had
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
topnotch
tripel
and
one
of
the
best
youre
going
to
find
outside
of
belgium
all
told
a
very
good
beer
though
not
my
favorite
tripel
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
really
light
and
quite
enjoyable
it
has
a
nice
ammount
of
carbonation
that
is
really
pleasant
and
gives
each
sip
a
fizzieness
that
lightens
the
feel
of
this
beer
overall
a
true
classic
a
great
belgian
tripel
made
in
canada
i
swear
the
good
people
at
unibroue
have
kidnapped
trappist
monks
and
brought
them
to
their
brewery
in
quebec
theyre
making
beers
that
are
easily
just
as
good
if
not
better
in
some
cases
than
the
classic
belgian
breweries
one
of
the
finest
brews
around
very
proud
that
this
is
a
canadian
brew
love
having
this
one
on
hand
around
the
house
ive
got
a
couple
in
the
cellar
as
well
well
worth
a
sampling
a
definite
favorite
of
mine
although
i
consume
liquids
like
a
fish
this
brew
demands
respect
drink
slowly
to
get
its
full
package
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
large
white
head
and
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
peaches
pears
yeast
pepper
and
cloves
the
flavor
has
peaches
pears
pepper
and
cloves
mildly
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
smooth
the
9
alcohol
is
well
hidden
dthe
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
and
this
has
a
sweetness
after
the
initial
yeast
the
is
quite
nice
d
this
is
a
smooth
beer
considering
the
abv
i
would
have
given
it
a
higher
rate
here
if
it
wasnt
for
the
constant
burping
from
the
high
carbonation
this
tripel
is
probably
one
of
the
best
ive
had
if
not
the
best
i
bought
a
four
pack
of
this
and
didnt
realize
3
were
gone
within
a
bit
of
time
very
drinkable
a
very
delicious
belgian
style
beer
ive
had
beers
from
unibrou
before
and
considered
them
just
reasonably
good
belgian
imitations
but
this
is
the
real
deal
it
stands
up
to
top
shelf
belgian
offerings
and
still
remains
unique
mdvery
light
and
highly
carbonated
body
even
reguardless
of
the
abv
which
is
not
even
noted
while
drinking
the
beer
which
combined
with
its
exceptional
taste
makes
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
the
beer
pours
to
a
opaque
golden
color
nose
is
rather
yeasty
i
love
it
the
aroma
has
bits
of
fruit
and
a
very
slight
spicyness
this
is
a
very
smooth
drink
but
rather
alcoholic
it
is
rather
good
but
the
only
problem
with
it
is
that
it
is
heavy
and
filling
if
the
end
of
the
world
ever
does
come
i
can
only
hope
it
is
accompanied
by
copious
amounts
of
this
beer
perfume
apples
clove
maybe
even
vanilla
and
you
cant
get
rid
of
it
for
a
little
while
sometimes
ive
noticed
aging
the
beer
a
year
or
three
will
make
it
a
little
less
harsh
in
exchange
for
additional
sweetness
id
recommend
that
341ml
bottle
poured
into
a
la
fin
du
monde
glass
cloudy
light
copper
color
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
citrus
and
green
apples
in
the
taste
there
is
more
yeast
citrus
cloves
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
really
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
body
is
maybe
a
little
thin
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
this
is
still
very
good
really
great
beer
honestly
i
am
not
sure
what
could
be
better
as
a
stylistic
representation
sublime
presents
itself
as
a
good
descriptor
any
beer
drinker
who
enjoys
fine
beer
would
consider
this
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
this
maudite
and
trois
pistoles
are
simply
some
of
the
best
beer
available
in
the
world
unibroue
make
a
couple
of
belgian
beers
that
would
make
those
from
the
native
land
quiver
in
thier
boots
upon
tasting
this
just
happens
to
be
the
best
of
them
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
another
one
without
the
unrealistic
expectations
d
little
bitter
and
certainly
not
as
sweet
as
many
of
the
other
tripels
ive
had
but
in
a
good
way
very
drinkable
and
really
good
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
great
beer
value
awesome
value
i
paid
2
59
for
a
single
and
it
was
worth
every
penny
cant
wait
to
taste
some
more
unibroue
brews
doverall
this
truly
is
worldclass
the
bodega
directly
downstairs
from
me
just
started
carrying
this
and
thank
goodness
for
that
itll
certainly
enter
my
regular
rotation
d
the
perfect
balance
of
this
beer
makes
it
extremely
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
with
a
higher
abv
not
favorite
triple
but
this
is
still
an
amazing
beer
color
is
hazy
golden
nice
head
that
dissipates
but
leaves
lingering
lacing
the
smell
is
great
although
i
m
not
sure
how
to
describe
it
malt
citrus
tamarind
its
complex
and
deep
the
taste
is
fantastic
malt
and
yeast
a
perfect
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
taste
is
complex
and
rich
and
remarkably
balanced
the
mouth
feel
is
excellent
its
heavy
and
almost
velvety
without
being
cloying
or
thick
the
alcohol
asserts
itself
but
the
beer
is
rich
enough
that
it
blends
in
overall
a
fantastic
beer
complex
tasty
drinkable
im
so
glad
i
bought
it
and
will
be
buying
it
again
highly
recommended
d
i
used
to
wonder
why
lfdm
received
the
top
100
love
but
no
other
unibroue
beers
did
now
i
no
longer
wonder
this
is
an
outstanding
tripel
the
price
keeps
me
buying
other
stuff
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
is
where
ill
go
d
this
is
a
solid
reliable
beer
thats
worth
revisiting
from
time
to
time
dangerously
quaffable
with
its
hidden
alcohol
of
9
percent
d
very
drinkable
very
smooth
and
refreshing
lacks
a
touch
of
the
sweetness
that
i
prefer
i
see
now
why
this
is
so
highly
reviewed
drink
i
wish
i
could
get
more
of
these
easily
cause
this
is
all
i
would
drink
d
honestly
dont
see
what
all
the
hype
is
about
wouldnt
mind
having
one
or
two
but
its
not
something
im
going
to
return
to
or
drink
too
much
of
overall
size
is
not
particularly
evident
pretty
easy
drinking
blindfolded
one
might
think
this
was
made
in
belgium
well
done
drinkability
despite
the
high
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
perfect
for
all
year
round
warms
well
too
d
like
any
beer
with
complex
flavors
more
than
a
few
of
these
would
be
difficult
to
finish
not
to
mention
the
abv
that
being
said
this
is
still
an
incredibly
drinkable
tripel
and
worthy
to
be
in
the
same
style
as
westmalle
and
tripel
karmeliet
mouthfeel
was
incredibly
crisp
with
a
nice
bubbly
bite
from
the
carbonation
almost
champagnelike
it
coated
the
mouth
with
a
silky
foamy
goodness
finish
was
a
just
dry
and
chalky
enough
to
keep
me
sippin
great
beer
my
first
from
unibroue
ill
be
back
hands
down
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
only
brew
that
i
have
had
that
comes
close
to
this
is
chimay
white
which
still
doesnt
stack
up
the
brew
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
very
large
and
stable
white
head
the
smell
is
typical
for
this
type
of
brew
with
a
slightly
strong
alcohol
smell
coming
through
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
at
the
top
of
the
charts
for
any
beer
let
alone
one
with
9
its
sweet
very
malty
and
has
a
slight
hop
presence
at
the
end
finally
the
drinkability
is
just
incredible
for
any
brew
let
alone
one
with
9
i
would
highly
reccommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
a
delicious
brew
to
sip
on
and
enjoy
maybe
even
have
two
overall
a
great
beer
instantly
i
was
reminded
of
mothership
wit
from
new
belgium
i
dont
like
that
beer
but
i
know
what
they
were
trying
to
do
now
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
allaround
if
you
see
it
try
it
a
simply
fantastic
beer
have
had
it
many
times
and
it
is
absolutely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
would
easily
place
it
in
my
top
10
pours
with
a
fantastic
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
esters
mixed
with
wonderful
complex
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
lots
of
yeast
characteristics
love
this
stuff
thoroughly
enjoyable
though
probably
more
in
moderation
than
in
a
session
half
way
through
a
single
341ml
bottle
i
had
already
begun
to
feel
an
alcohol
buzz
something
for
those
miserable
fallwinter
days
perhaps
d
exceptionally
delicious
and
drinkable
none
of
the
characteristics
ever
seem
to
become
overpowering
i
shall
enjoy
this
entire
bomber
on
my
own
and
would
be
tempted
to
open
another
this
stuff
is
awesome
i
simply
love
it
edit
i
just
ordered
this
at
the
tap
again
thinking
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
given
it
all
fives
until
i
drank
it
i
just
cant
find
a
flaw
in
this
beer
blows
my
mind
every
time
bottle
poured
into
trappist
glass
poured
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
small
creamy
head
that
faded
fast
aroma
provided
a
good
deal
of
sweet
notes
most
notable
a
strong
fruit
and
flowery
hint
full
bodied
the
drink
was
very
smooth
with
a
very
average
carbonation
there
was
just
enough
here
overall
the
flavor
did
not
disappoint
in
the
sweet
department
but
it
was
not
overly
sweet
a
great
compliment
to
the
hearty
stew
i
had
it
with
this
is
one
to
go
back
to
over
and
over
again
drinkability
i
tend
to
think
of
this
as
something
that
should
be
drank
in
the
summer
its
crisp
and
refreshing
but
the
yeast
is
at
the
forefront
of
this
brew
and
in
the
end
is
just
a
bit
too
much
as
mentioned
im
reminded
of
a
dry
white
wine
which
for
me
feels
like
overfermentation
which
has
lead
to
a
boozy
feeling
after
750ml
of
la
fin
du
monde
i
think
i
might
have
to
drink
some
monistat
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
pale
wheat
color
with
a
clean
crisp
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
didnt
leave
any
lacing
to
speak
of
even
with
the
high
alcohol
content
the
nose
is
of
thick
floral
beds
lots
of
clove
and
sweet
honey
the
taste
is
heavy
clove
and
warm
alcohol
coats
your
throat
there
is
a
slight
kick
but
a
good
balance
and
if
sipped
rather
than
drank
it
leaves
a
tingling
sensation
in
your
throat
this
has
a
thin
body
but
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
drink
i
say
drink
as
some
of
these
triples
are
more
like
drink
rather
than
beer
very
fine
choice
cheers
y
salud
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
again
and
something
i
would
encourage
everybody
to
try
at
least
once
also
note
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
several
bars
and
i
have
to
say
stick
to
bottle
this
beer
has
a
tendency
to
build
up
deposit
in
the
lines
and
also
sells
slower
than
most
taps
so
i
have
never
had
a
completely
sound
pour
on
draft
drinkability
i
really
dont
know
how
these
belgian
style
ales
hide
their
alcohol
so
well
its
almost
unbelievable
that
this
is
9
abv
because
it
drinks
like
4
or
5
this
beer
is
balanced
yet
flavourful
and
goes
down
smooth
poured
a
nice
golden
carbonated
yellow
into
a
snifter
with
two
fingers
of
bright
white
head
that
laced
very
well
the
smell
was
off
the
charts
cloves
allspice
coriander
banana
tart
apple
pear
lime
bubble
gum
and
i
know
that
im
missing
a
few
couldnt
wait
to
start
sipping
and
when
i
did
what
overwhelmed
me
was
not
all
of
the
aforementioned
flavors
and
then
some
but
the
balance
between
all
of
those
flavors
furthermore
the
alcohol
content
was
not
as
evident
as
expected
in
the
finish
the
feel
was
nicely
carbonated
and
medium
and
when
i
was
done
with
the
bomber
which
didnt
take
very
long
i
wish
i
had
purchased
several
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
i
love
it
find
du
monde
is
an
interesting
compromise
between
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
a
true
tripel
its
as
if
you
mixed
duvel
and
westmalle
very
tasty
extremely
drinkable
and
moreish
which
is
a
dangerous
quality
in
a
beer
of
this
abv
ive
had
the
unibroue
countless
times
but
this
was
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
the
opportunity
to
put
it
up
against
other
examples
of
the
style
as
a
canadian
im
glad
to
say
it
held
up
well
and
only
lost
my
vote
in
its
contest
because
the
karmeleit
had
slightly
more
complexity
the
general
consensus
was
also
that
the
sweetness
actually
worked
against
it
on
the
nose
theres
a
wonderfully
fruity
and
spicy
aroma
which
i
now
recognise
as
the
house
yeast
strain
the
initial
flavour
hit
comes
from
cloves
and
cinnamon
but
then
transitions
to
sweet
phenolic
malts
that
strongly
emphasise
apple
and
pear
i
wish
it
had
a
slightly
crisper
finish
which
i
think
would
be
more
to
style
but
its
pleasant
nonetheless
drinkability
ok
i
think
the
clove
taste
is
a
bit
overpowering
drowning
out
any
other
flavors
that
this
one
might
have
had
so
it
looses
drinkability
there
drinkability
good
to
enjoy
over
a
period
of
time
do
not
rush
through
this
beer
it
has
a
lot
to
offer
that
would
be
missed
due
to
a
hurried
drinking
poured
a
cloudy
yellowish
amber
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
white
head
nose
is
fruit
hops
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
fruit
belgian
yeast
spice
and
warming
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
and
smooth
on
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
it
was
warming
spicy
and
fruits
on
the
mouthfeel
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
mildly
spiced
with
spritzy
carbonation
tickling
the
tongue
this
beer
is
certainly
different
and
maybe
thats
why
its
been
getting
such
stellar
reviews
great
tasting
but
i
just
dont
buy
it
it
doesnt
seem
to
share
the
same
complexities
as
many
other
top
rated
beers
although
what
flavors
it
has
are
very
well
balanced
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
a
quality
brew
im
not
sure
why
i
differ
so
much
from
everyone
else
but
i
suppose
it
just
happens
ive
been
around
the
unibroue
block
a
little
bit
and
i
theyre
just
not
as
good
imho
as
other
bas
say
they
are
i
split
a
750ml
bottle
with
my
wife
poured
carefully
into
large
wine
glasses
the
beer
produced
a
nice
34
head
in
both
glasses
the
color
is
a
pale
straw
and
the
beer
is
a
little
hazy
the
smell
is
mild
smells
a
tiny
bit
sweet
and
malty
and
its
got
that
belgian
phenol
thing
going
but
faintly
the
taste
is
fantastic
up
front
theres
lemon
pear
and
yeast
and
it
has
a
nice
sour
middle
followed
by
a
very
clean
finish
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
tastes
like
a
belgian
beer
without
the
earthy
funkiness
but
it
is
working
for
me
in
a
big
way
very
fresh
and
very
clean
i
wanted
more
when
the
bottle
was
empty
d
this
beer
is
about
as
easy
to
drink
as
any
beer
ive
had
i
always
forget
how
good
this
is
if
the
end
of
the
world
was
actually
coming
i
would
not
be
very
happy
if
this
was
the
last
beer
i
ever
had
well
done
unibroue
you
lived
up
to
the
hype
easy
to
drink
but
a
real
sipper
a
great
take
on
the
tripel
style
fantastic
example
of
the
style
skittles
in
a
beer
seriously
big
ivory
head
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
leaving
nice
lacing
in
the
tulip
smells
of
yeast
pear
apple
and
banana
hops
are
there
but
not
very
noticeable
big
time
fruit
like
in
the
smell
but
with
a
boozy
bite
that
brigs
it
together
nicely
great
fluffy
mouthfeel
without
getting
foam
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
quickly
dissipating
ivory
head
and
little
to
no
lacing
smells
of
clove
spiceand
fruit
taste
the
same
as
the
smell
sweet
fruit
clove
with
a
semi
dry
finish
just
a
fantastic
taste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
very
carbonated
drinkability
is
a
little
hampered
by
the
high
abv
that
is
well
hidden
until
the
bottom
of
the
glass
like
i
feel
now
drinking
while
reviewing
overall
a
fantastic
beeralthough
not
at
all
like
the
st
bernardus
tripel
the
corsendonk
agnus
or
the
chimay
tripel
i
have
also
tried
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
to
drink
more
than
one
youll
probably
want
to
sip
this
one
and
appreciate
the
complex
fruity
and
spicy
flavors
here
make
sure
not
to
drink
it
too
cold
or
the
sweetness
will
dominate
unibroue

9
to

which
you
really
cant
even
taste

around
great
beer
wish
it
was
more
available
d
outstanding
really
hides
the
alcohol
content
well
and
only
gets
better
as
it
goes
i
picked
up
a
single
in
a
sixer
mixer
bottle
to
snifter
golden
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
and
thin
lacing
congruent
smell
and
tastenotes
of
young
white
grapefruit
a
mild
floral
arrangement
and
light
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
a
smooth
medium
with
light
carbonation
highly
drinkable
definitely
not
abrasive
considering
the
high
abv
and
its
accessibility
will
allow
for
a
pleasant
return
to
the
end
of
the
world
one
day
pours
a
cloudy
goldenyellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
perhaps
a
slight
whispiness
but
no
crown
at
all
nose
has
a
slight
spiciness
to
it
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
bit
of
citrus
taste
has
slight
spincess
as
well
with
nice
fruityfloral
layers
moderate
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
fairly
medium
with
fairly
mild
carbonation
in
my
opinion
this
brew
kind
of
reminds
me
of
chardonnay
quite
drinkable
drink
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
fairly
drinkable
considering
the
high
abv
the
carbonation
isnt
particularly
overwhelming
either
a
nice
offering
from
unibroue
probably
one
of
the
better
nonbelgian
tripels
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
am
slowly
making
my
way
through
a
number
of
unibroue
offerings
and
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
overall
for
someone
like
me
who
doesnt
normally
appreciate
this
style
i
was
very
surprised
still
i
think
it
is
overrated
here
on
ba
and
that
the
rates
given
at
ratebeer
com
reflect
the
quality
of
this
beer
much
better
but
again
decent
brew
nice
and
drinkable
recommendable
over
all
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
recommend
it
to
others
especially
to
those
who
want
a
drink
that
wont
dropkick
you
in
the
face
we
shared
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
maredsous
chalice
and
a
large
wine
goblet
pours
a
delightful
golden
color
with
a
quite
vigorous
amount
of
foam
very
nice
the
aroma
even
upon
warming
up
was
not
particularly
strong
some
coriander
and
citrus
but
not
a
lot
past
that
the
taste
was
also
a
bit
of
a
letdown
it
was
very
smooth
but
we
were
hoping
for
more
belgian
ester
and
yeast
flavors
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
i
definitely
suggest
you
try
it
i
feel
that
the
smells
and
the
head
werent
as
strong
as
some
other
folks
here
described
it
could
have
been
an
older
bottle
im
not
sure
i
didnt
look
at
the
bottle
the
bar
tender
tossed
it
immediately
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
its
so
smooth
and
tasty
and
good
you
wont
want
to
put
this
one
down
and
wow
this
beer
could
really
be
dangerous
its
9
abv
and
drinks
like
a
5
i
would
definitely
session
with
this
beer
but
i
would
have
to
be
careful
of
course
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
witbier
in
certain
aspects
but
the
malt
really
puts
it
in
its
place
it
is
quite
light
in
character
for
a
brew
with
such
a
big
bodied
reputation
was
quite
delightful
and
would
definitely
have
again
as
i
bought
this
beer
i
heard
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
we
may
not
see
this
fine
brew
in
western
australia
again
due
to
something
with
importers
so
its
bittersweet
that
i
get
to
try
this
fine
brew
again
and
review
it
and
fingers
crossed
we
do
see
it
againanyways
it
pours
a
cloudy
honey
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
with
nice
sporadic
lacingthe
aromas
are
wonderful
so
different
to
most
other
beers
out
there
the
aromas
are
fresh
and
dried
fruitsbaked
breadfigs
and
even
some
pepperoni
too
quite
a
different
smell
altogether
and
the
taste
doesnt
dissapoint
either
with
tastes
of
banannadried
figspeachesnectarines
and
yeasty
bread
very
nice
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
starting
out
full
and
finishing
lightcrisp
and
dry
like
a
fine
champagne
with
the
alcohol
very
well
hidden
making
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
hope
it
doesnt
dissapear
from
our
shores
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
and
has
a
dry
finish
the
key
to
this
beer
is
knowing
how
to
pour
it
having
the
sense
to
not
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
but
sometimes
you
have
to
do
what
you
have
to
do
so
far
this
is
on
the
top
of
my
list
what
an
incredible
brew
it
is
if
i
could
i
would
drink
it
on
a
daily
basis
i
dont
even
get
the
alcohol
it
is
masked
so
well
this
is
not
a
session
brew
pours
a
moderately
carbonated
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
slight
head
there
is
a
nice
spicy
smell
with
a
cloudy
and
alcoholic
sweet
aroma
banana
maby
the
best
part
taste
wow
more
carbonated
than
visible
and
hints
of
lemon
and
spices
with
hops
blending
into
a
nice
warming
sensation
of
a
finale
a
great
beer
that
is
reminiscent
slightly
of
champagne
its
hazy
and
the
colour
of
sunshine
golden
and
brilliant
it
has
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
cap
on
the
body
after
fading
away
a
little
good
retention
and
nice
lace
it
smells
of
banana
cidery
apple
and
peppery
spice
theres
a
boozy
solvent
character
to
it
and
something
vaguely
suggestive
of
plastic
like
a
vinyl
record
it
tastes
of
sweet
orchard
and
tropical
fruits
with
some
nice
boozy
alcohol
and
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
lends
this
beer
a
spicy
character
the
carbonation
is
fairly
high
and
plays
nicely
with
the
peppery
alcohol
its
so
potent
but
it
just
goes
down
like
water
especially
when
its
just
slightly
cool
the
alcohol
doesnt
hinder
it
at
all
in
that
respect
this
is
a
750ml
bottle
when
you
think
about
it
youre
really
having
a
little
more
than
two
to
begin
with
and
its
still
going
down
like
water
towards
the
end
it
has
depth
well
integrated
complexity
and
its
easy
to
drink
whats
not
to
love
drinkability
is
average
a
single
beer
of
this
style
and
strength
is
generally
enough
for
me
d
high
this
is
fairly
light
despite
being
so
tasty
and
the
flavor
really
never
gets
overpowering
complex
and
interesting
certainly
a
worldclass
tripel
tasting
notes
from
02
sept
2009
just
a
phenomenal
high
abv
beer
on
first
impression
the
taste
reminded
me
of
hoegaarden
with
a
bigger
but
not
obsessive
alcohol
back
end
the
wonderfulhorrible
thing
about
this
beer
is
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
it
would
not
be
hard
to
consume
3
or
4
with
dinner
i
had
this
beer
paired
with
an
steak
medium
rare
and
it
fit
perfectly
such
as
great
beer
the
color
is
a
golden
yellow
when
poured
it
creates
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
head
but
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
is
mellow
with
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
hard
to
describe
except
for
the
crispness
and
subtle
hints
of
fruit
and
citrus
great
mouthfeel
all
around
anytime
beer
drinkability
is
great
since
at
9
abv
i
could
drink
at
least
four
but
who
knows
what
would
happen
to
me
after
that
outstanding
drinkability
even
at
this
abv
this
would
make
a
great
year
round
beer
a
great
tripel
especially
given
the
price
point
d
not
the
most
flavorful
tripel
ive
ever
tasted
it
actually
gets
much
better
as
it
warms
and
loses
a
bit
of
its
carbonation
good
beer
but
think
i
was
expecting
more
due
to
its
reputation
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
half
a
finger
of
white
head
that
sits
on
top
for
a
while
smells
of
apples
and
yeast
a
little
clove
and
some
alcohol
taste
more
of
the
same
quite
delicious
mouthfeel
creamy
medium
carbonation
a
little
bite
very
nice
extremely
drinkable
especially
for
9
abv
i
may
be
in
trouble
with
how
drinkable
this
one
is
alcohol
barely
noticeable
the
after
taste
is
ok
not
great
but
its
the
typical
craft
beer
after
this
is
a
good
value
buy
as
far
a
tripels
go
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
beer
again
in
the
future
the
carbonation
is
high
enough
to
lend
a
bite
that
really
keeps
the
palate
clean
between
sips
overall
definitely
a
highcaliber
beer
thats
well
made
everything
is
in
the
nuances
though
as
its
not
a
inyourface
beer
i
prefer
more
guts
with
my
belgian
beers
which
is
reflected
in
my
score
nevertheless
i
like
this
beer
and
next
time
ill
drink
it
at
near
room
temp
to
get
a
better
grasp
on
it
is
it
the
be
all
end
of
the
world
not
quite
but
its
right
up
there
drinkability
out
of
the
unibroue
beers
i
have
had
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
not
in
terms
of
quality
but
in
terms
of
it
not
being
a
sipper
i
truly
cant
believe
that
this
is
a
9
beer
when
i
am
drinking
it
and
the
carbonation
truly
makes
it
perfect
for
summer
which
just
does
not
compute
in
my
mind
trois
pistoles
is
still
my
favorite
unibroue
but
this
is
a
close
second
im
in
awe
of
belgians
gotta
try
more
drinkability
alcohol
content
notwithstanding
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
like
that
fact
that
each
sip
brings
another
complex
collection
of
flavors
to
contemplate
this
is
the
best
value
ive
come
across
in
alberta
with
no
questions
asked
unibroue
should
be
proud
of
their
strong
ales
they
are
world
class
right
here
in
my
backyard
warning
if
experiencing
la
fin
du
monde
consume
la
fin
du
monde
it
wont
feel
as
bad
a
bit
syrupy
on
the
mouth
the
sweetness
coats
the
palate
drinkability
a
great
beer
this
is
something
that
i
would
certainly
like
to
keep
in
the
house
for
any
occasion
i
gave
drinkability
a
2
but
only
because
i
thought
if
im
drunk
enough
i
could
probably
gag
a
few
down
for
the
high
abv
but
i
dont
get
drunk
to
much
and
will
probably
never
do
this
notes
a
delicious
tripel
to
be
sure
but
the
low
carbonation
leaves
me
wanting
a
bit
more
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
definitely
a
beer
ill
seek
out
again
especially
for
the
reasonable
price
notes
la
fin
du
monde
is
definitely
firmly
entrenched
on
the
refined
side
rather
than
the
explosive
side
of
the
tripel
category
there
are
others
that
are
more
explosively
fruity
spicy
and
powerful
but
this
is
a
very
wellmade
beer
that
stays
in
perfect
balance
throughout
nice
melding
of
harmonious
flavors
that
make
this
quite
enjoyable
i
really
wish
unibroue
would
ease
up
on
the
carbonation
but
it
deserves
all
of
the
praise
that
it
gets
nonetheless
recommended
a
ridiculously
good
value
a
must
try
if
you
like
hefes
or
spicy
beers
in
general
notes
a
very
nice
tripel
great
appearance
and
a
nice
overall
combination
of
flavors
and
aromas
make
this
an
very
enticing
beer
my
first
nonbelgian
tripel
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
light
straw
color
with
a
serious
amount
of
carbonation
i
had
just
cooled
the
beer
nice
smell
not
atypical
of
a
tripel
really
enjoyed
the
taste
obvious
sweetness
but
with
a
really
solid
earthy
type
dirt
sort
of
flavor
maybe
the
yeast
got
a
little
stirred
up
but
it
really
adds
to
the
flavor
good
aftertaste
and
unusually
drinkable
for
a
tripel
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
unibroue
notes
its
a
nice
beer
i
confess
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
tripels
whether
belgium
or
their
american
reinterpretations
i
like
them
sure
but
im
just
not
a
big
fan
so
this
one
does
not
cut
it
for
me
as
a
favorite
or
an
iconic
reference
i
think
that
for
tripel
lovers
this
is
probably
a
delight
but
being
such
a
great
beer
there
is
something
that
does
not
quite
gel
in
the
end
for
me
d
ridiculously
drinkable
i
could
put
these
away
often
and
quickly
and
probably
drink
myself
to
death
maybe
its
just
the
triple
distilling
but
this
goes
down
too
smoothly
and
too
easily
for
how
much
alcohol
is
in
there
nice
mild
tasting
d
didnt
finish
it
but
that
might
have
been
because
of
the
great
food
will
definitely
have
to
try
again
pours
a
beautiful
golden
orange
thats
slightly
hazy
but
with
ample
foam
the
nose
is
very
inviting
with
crisp
belgian
spice
and
orange
zest
complimented
by
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
medium
body
with
robust
effervescence
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
is
not
spicy
as
the
aroma
may
suggest
there
are
strong
citrus
orange
notes
with
a
surprisingly
crisp
bite
of
hops
with
a
somewhat
dry
finish
additionally
there
is
a
lingering
flavor
or
that
great
spice
this
beer
has
a
great
complex
flavor
thats
not
perplexing
a
great
and
accessible
tripel
for
all
occasions
its
taste
very
plain
its
good
reminds
me
of
duvel
to
me
its
a
very
high
alcohol
session
beer
so
id
drink
tihs
when
i
get
to
drunk
a
wonderful
tripel
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
making
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
dangerously
drinkable
at
9
this
beer
took
some
getting
used
to
for
me
this
was
my
first
tripel
and
after
about
the
first
half
a
dozen
sips
i
was
hooked
d
this
is
how
a
tripel
should
be
made
i
havent
had
many
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
it
is
in
the
top
100
for
good
reason
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
high
to
get
this
a
5
but
i
can
forgive
the
high
alcohol
here
because
it
tastes
very
good
overall
this
is
a
sweet
tripel
with
good
complexity
la
fin
du
monde
is
an
excellent
beer
but
its
kind
of
joke
that
it
is
the
number
one
tripel
on
ba
ranking
higher
than
all
of
the
original
belgian
versions
but
who
am
i
to
argue
with
1500
reviews
i
prefer
a
drier
tripel
to
each
his
own
with
a
fantastic
spicy
start
and
a
combination
of
hops
cloves
citrus
and
just
a
hint
of
something
floral
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
finishes
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
this
beer
over
and
over
again
overall
a
superb
beer
leaving
me
wanting
more
again
kudos
to
the
chef
pours
a
hazysediment
filled
golden
orange
with
a
fizzy
two

head
that
disappears
very
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
beer
no
lacing
is
present
on
my
glass
halfway
through
the
bottle
not
a
very
strong

smells
like
a
good
belgian
beer
has
belgian
yeast
spice
a
bit
of
fruit
and
maybe
a
smokedmalty
smell
to
it
tastes
of
belgian
yeast
malts
a
bit
of
citrus
some
fruits
and
once

good
malty
aftertaste

mouthfeel

has
a
little
cream
in
the

and
leaves
that
good
belgian
taste
lingering
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
here
for
a
tripel
taste
is
great
and
the
9
alcohol
is
well
hidden
no
alcohol
taste
shines
through
at
all
doesnt
feel
too
heavy
on
the
stomach
definately
has
that
signature
unibroue

great
golden

with
a
nice

has
a
strong
deep
flavor
with
lots
of

and
a
bit
of

to
it
nice
fruity
bouquet
has
just
the
right
ammount
of
carbanation
has
a
great
mouthfeel
just
a
great
beer
in
every
aspect
has
little
alcohol
flavor
even
though
it
has
a
9
abv
d
very
nice
could
drink
a
bunch
would
have
to
be
careful
do
to
well
hidden
abv
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
but
not
the
best
awesome
brew
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
twofinger
offbeige
head
that
lasted
a
little
while
the
smell
is
complex
and
represents
some
of
the
best
parts
about
the
style
there
is
some
coriander
and
clove
along
with
some
fruitiness
including
tangerine
lemon
and
a
bit
of
banana
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
you
can
almost
taste
something
new
every
sip
but
it
always
seems
to
fit
together
perfectly
to
be
complex
and
delicious
without
being
overpowering
or
cloyingly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
some
moderate
carbonation
this
is
probably
in
the
top
three
of
my
varieties
of
tripel
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
d
tripels
are
probably
my
least
favorite
style
of
the
high
abv
belgian
styles
but
i
think
i
can
go
as
far
as
saying
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
ever
had
complex
and
balanced
yet
with
plenty
of
that
belgian
edginess
this
one
is
really
easy
to
drink
but
deserves
to
be
sipped
and
savored
at
a
gentle
pace
drinkability
strong
deep
flavors
this
is
to
be
enjoyed
like
a
good
book
near
the
fire
sadness
will
occur
when
the
beer
is
no
more
drinkability
due
to
its
9
abv
lack
of
any
alcohol
flavor
or
heat
crazy
deliciousness
and
perfect
mouthfeel
is
triple
red
flag
warning
dangerously
excellent
sweeter
than
most
tripels
le
fin
gets
a
little
cloying
towards
the
end
of
a
bottle
this
brew
is
delicious
very
tasty
very
drinkable
it
could
get
me
all
kinds
of
shitty
if
i
made
a
session
out
of
this
brew
this
is
why
i
prefer
to
sip
and
enjoy
after
all
it
was
probably
meant
for
just
that
if
i
could
line
this
next
to
all
of
the
other
triples
i
have
had
and
taste
test
them
i
think
this
may
be
the
one
to
beat
very
stellar
unibroues
offering
is
certainly
worthy
of
an
excursion
fortunately
it
is
significantly
more
readily
available
la
fin
du
monde
has
become
a
staple
for
me
even
an
ingredient
as
few
beers
have
such
versatility
yum
d
a
tasty
tripel
overall
not
a
bad
triple
but
overall
much
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
dont
think
i
could
have
two
in
a
row
id
imagine
this
is
pretty
versatile
with
food
plus
if
you
get
the
corked
and
caged
bottle
well
that
has
class
written
all
over
it
ill
try
it
sometime

i

but
i
want
more
the
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
and
wonderful
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
this
is
a
beer
for
the
gods
thank
you
unibroue
for
making
this
available
to
a
mere
mortal
it
may
be
a
little
too
sweet
to
rate
very
high
in
drinkability
but
ill
definitely
suffer
this
sipper
absolutely
great
beer
drinkability
while
the
abv
is
a
tad
high
the
flavors
and
smell
are
just
too
damn
good
to
pass
up
and
not
say
that
this
is
an
especially
drinkable
beer
the
alcohol
is
so
well
masked
that
its
easy
to
get
down
and
the
strong
robust
flavors
would
easily
compliment
any
meal
making
the
abv
a
little
easier
to
deal
with
overall
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
ever
had
and
a
great
overall
beer
d
what
a
great
tripel
its
got
all
the
right
flavors
but
presents
itself
in
a
delicate
and
complex
way
crisp
and
refreshing
for
a
summers
day
if
i
didnt
pass
out
due
to
the
9
alcohol
i
would
drink
this
all
day
long
d
probably
the
best
tripel
ive
ever
had
a
legendary
beer
well
deserving
of
praise
also
my
first
unibroue
though
i
had
my
2nd
later
in
the
night
and
i
was
equally
impressed
with
the
famous
french
canadian
brewery
this
is
a
winner
and
one
you
should
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
huge
shout
out
to
porters
pub
too
those
guys
rock
d
very
nice
and
complex
alcohol
levels
are
approaching
high
im
feeling
their
effects
after
half
a
glass
so
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
i
dont
like
bitterness
i
prefer
sweetness
so
this
beer
is
going
down
very
well
i
wish
i
had
a
750ml
rather
than
a
12oz
d
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
style
one
i
have
had
so
many
times
that
it
is
almost
difficult
to
review
it
objectively
the
spice
notes
blend
perfectly
with
juicy
tropical
fruit
notes
and
make
for
a
very
refreshing
beer
despite
the
high
abv
the
only
real
weak
point
is
the
appearance
and
the
anemic
head
not
quite
as
complex
as
la
chouffe
but
very
good
probably
the
best
tripel
made
outside
of
belgium
overall
a
refreshing
9
abv
beer
very
tart
and
fruity
but
good
for
a
few
this
is
a
must
try
i
highly
recommend
sip
this
not
only
for
the
subtle
flavors
but
also
out
of
respect
for
the
potency
a
beer
you
can
sip
all
night
and
not
get
bored
but
seriously
be
careful
drinking
this
beer
because
it
deceivingly
strong
all
in
all
its
a
favorite
of
mine
and
i
recommend
it
to
anybody
who
loves
belgians
i
also
think
it
could
be
a
good
gateway
beer
to
get
people
into
better
beer
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
im
not
a
big
fan
of
tripels
but
i
do
appreciate
them
this
one
was
balanced
well
without
being
so
alcoholic
overly
bitey
and
harsh
and
the
drinkability
was
great
although
the
abv
is
very
high
i
could
easily
put
down
a
couple
small
goblets
of
this
great
brew
on
a
cool
day
i
did
however
get
a
little
tired
of
the
flavors
after
a
couple
goblets
so
i
wouldnt
really
enjoy
drinking
anymore
than
that
not
much
to
say
if
you
enjoy
this
style
than
try
this
one
its
definitely
the
smoothest
one
ive
had
so
far
d
excellent
beer
in
its
class
not
overly
alcoholed
like
many
other
tripels
and
very
very
smooth
p
s
i
know
its
made
in
canada
but
since
we
pretty
much
own
them
its
like
its
brewed
here
im
really
not
sure
how
people
can
drink
these
types
of
yeasty
beers
regularly
poured
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
eventually
diminished
to
about
onefinger
size
body
was
hazy
with
light
particles
and
a
dark
yellow
color
lacing
was
fair
very
nice
aroma
average
yeast
some
fruitiness
as
well
great
on
the
palate
full
body
creamy
with
lively
carbonation
you
can
taste
light
alcohol
but
its
not
overwhelming
at
all
the
fruit
comes
through
again
and
stays
with
you
for
a
good
amount
of
time
delicious
a
fantastic
tripel
im
very
happy
unibroue
is
here
in
canada
to
provide
us
with
authentictasting
belgium
brews
as
a
final
note
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
anecdotally
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
esters
and
fusel
alcohols
will
tend
to
give
you
a
bigger
meaner
hangover
than
one
without
so
be
careful
if
youre
going
to
get
all
messed
up
on
this
brew
you
may
live
to
regret
it
notes
i
am
torn
with
this
beer
i
really
enjoy
it
but
i
prefer
other
tripels
a
bit
more
while
it
is
a
delicious
beer
that
i
will
continue
to
keep
it
will
find
its
way
only
occasionally
to
my
glass
poured
into
victory
brewpub
golden
monkey
tulip
glass
each
made
for
the
other
i
scored
low
on
this
review
because
of
the
age
of
the
beer
i
could
easily
scored
55
on
taste
appearance
and
mouthfeel
on
a
fresh
brew
try
this
beer
its
really
a
must
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
style
tripels
and
im
very
glad
i
picked
up
a
4pack
instead
of
a
single
great
taste
and
drinkability
awesome
overall
this
beer
is
delightfully
executed
theres
no
caramely
sweetness
nor
overpowering
bitterness
nor
wacky
inappropriate
ester
flavors
and
yet
the
9
abv
is
completely
masked
there
are
better
tripels
but
ones
as
pleasant
to
drink
as
this
are
rare
this
ones
much
more
drinkable
than
the
high
abv
would
typically
allow
pretty
amazing
really
d
one
750
ml
bottle
is
enough
for
one
sitting
otherwise
you
can
drink
this
quickly
or
have
it
a
nice
sipper
d
great
drinkability
and
very
refreshing
for
warmer
weather
still
had
enough
body
to
take
it
seriously
though
drinkability
a
perfect
and
very
tasty
tripel
with
outstanding
flavor
and
no
strong
alcohol
taste
or
warmth
for
a
relatively
high
abv
brew
could
easily
do
a
session
with
this
one
and
i
have
for
a
canadian
made
belgian
tripel
style
this
is
one
of
the
tastiest
examples
of
the
style
i
can
think
of
beating
out
several
belgian
made
tripels
that
i
like
quite
a
bit
everything
done
to
perfection
for
smell
taste
and
drinkability
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
tripel
out
there
great
beer
i
have
had
this
beer
a
number
of
times
i
normally
buy
the
beer
in
the
large
bottle
the
beer
has
an
excellent
and
clean
taste
which
actually
expands
in
your
mouth
with
a
bouquet
as
some
would
describe
wines
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
would
like
a
beer
for
a
special
occasion
drinkability
is
perfect
i
would
never
turn
down
this
beer
anytime
of
year
the
color
on
this
beer
is
fantastic
but
im
a
little
turned
off
by
the
humongous
head
on
it
while
youre
waiting
for
that
to
settle
you
can
pretty
much
smell
this
beer
from
across
the
room
as
the
spicy
and
citrusy
aroma
is
very
strong
the
taste
is
as
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
spicy
and
citrusy
but
also
much
stronger
than
you
would
first
expect
the
complex
tastes
add
to
the
feel
of
this
brew
yet
it
lost
points
on
drinkability
because
of
my
tendency
to
take
small
sips
and
savor
each
one
d
sipping
beer
the
whole
way
but
very
nice
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
great
flavour
not
too
sweet
for
a
triple
and
smooth
as
hell
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
i
woudnt
pass
out
way
too
early
on
d
definately
worth
the
money
i
think
i
paid
about
6
99
for
this
bottle
but
it
tastes
very
expensive
and
well
balanced
i
will
probably
buy
this
again
to
share
with
a
freind
this
is
a
special
occasion
beer
although
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
smooth
i
would
not
drink
it
every
day
decent
buzz
after
finishing
bottle
everything
about
this
beer
reminds
me
of
delerium
tremons
of
you
liked
delerium
you
will
like
this
one
important
i
would
say
a
great
beer
the
fresher
it
is
sugar
makes
it
do
weird
things
if
it
sits
for
a
bit
too
long
starts
tasting
like
an
old
oversweet
bpa
ive
avoided
unibroue
because
ive
been
rather
isolationist
but
score
one
for
canada
this
is
a
tasty
brew
pours
a
pale
cloudy
amber
bananaclove
and
citric
fruits
in
the
nose
taste
is
spices
banana
bread
and
pears
in
that
order
medium
bodied
washes
down
clean
and
leaves
a
banana
bread
aftertaste
nice
beer
here
not
my
style
but
still
enjoyable
and
one
i
would
buy
again
poured
into
a
wine
glass
at
my
local
bar
they
dont
have
the
proper
glassware
so
it
definitely
deserved
this
over
a
pint
glass
lol
pours
a
very
decent
size
head
with
smells
of
pepper
ripe
apples
and
pears
carbonation
is
very
high
but
works
so
well
with
this
taste
is
outstanding
with
a
crisp
spicy
and
fruity
balance
that
is
wonderful
mouthfeel
is
near
perfect
and
this
beer
will
sneak
up
on
you
with
its
9
abv
i
had
3
after
a
few
ipas
and
they
let
me
know
it
a
fantastic
brew
by
the
champs
of
canada
imho
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
with
sizeable
white
head
very
fruity
aroma
lots
of
carbonation
spices
yeast
evident
slight
bit
of
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
finish
which
is
moderately
dry
good
offering
from
unibrou
but
to
me
is
does
not
fit
the
abbey
tripel
style
more
like
a
fruity
version
of
a
duvel
drinkability
very
drinkable
goes
down
quite
nicely
md
just
a
bit
sticky
which
is
to
be
expect
from
the
style
ends
a
little
dry
which
is
nice
in
this
high
abv
brew
really
tasty
and
deceptive
in
terms
of
potency
this
is
something
you
could
drink
all
night
but
would
regret
in
the
morning
d
would
i
drink
it
again
yeah
but
not
any
time
soon
i
could
see
how
lovers
of
this
style
would
go
crazy
for
this
well
made
beer
carbonation
seems
a
little
excessive
flavours
definitely
open
up
once
its
died
down
a
little
d
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
but
it
is
incredibly
well
hidden
id
have
another
in
a
heartbeat
but
id
pay
for
it
nice
warm
alcohol
notes
a
decent
beer
that
is
a
sipping
beer
for
me
not
really
a
fan
of
the
fizzy
alka
seltzer
type
carbonation
this
really
does
feel
light
and
refreshing
i
dunno
if
its
possible
to
disguise
alcohol
as
well
as
unibroue
have
achieved
with
this
beer
sure
there
is
a
bit
of
a
warming
sensation
but
that
really
is
the
only
hint
at
the
abv
of
the
brew
for
that
i
must
give
this
a
5
for
drinkability
yeah
im
not
gonna
session
this
beer
but
as
far
as
a
strong
beer
that
tastes
so
light
and
refreshing
this
cant
be
beat
my
favorite
unibroue
product
which
i
need
to
cellar
but
is
hard
not
to
consume
everyone
should
drink
this
brew
at
some
time
drinkabilty
very
high
this
beer
is
appropriately
named
if
the
end
of
the
world
was
coming
i
would
be
consuming
with
reckless
abandon
taste
is
dry
fizzy
yeast
some
fruits
spice
and
a
touch
of
citrus
ends
dry
and
a
little
bitter
unibroue
seems
to
churn
out
amazingly
good
beers
at
great
price
points
trippels
tend
not
to
be
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
an
ale
i
have
loved
since
i
first
had
it
years
ago
exceptional
in
every
way
drinkability
a
little
high
on
the
abv
but
other
than
that
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
pours
medium
golden
almost
translucent
with
a
thickwhite
had
of
both
large
and
fine
bubbles
dissipating
into
a
nice
thin
rim
of
small
bubbles
nose
is
very
fruity
light
fruits
and
some
tropical
qualities
as
well
and
some
yeasty
esters
are
present
also
palate
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
some
soft
malt
in
there
very
carbonated
and
prickly
and
white
pepper
too
really
a
top
quality
beer
with
only
a
few
quibbles
that
keep
it
from
matching
up
to
my
all
time
favorites
d
pretty
good
ill
most
likely
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
sometime
fun
little
beer
with
just
enough
complexity
and
still
your
able
to
sit
and
sip
it
for
a
while
without
thinking
too
much
overall
this
is
very
good
although
triples
may
be
a
bit
too
high
in
abv
for
my
preference
i
could
easily
drink
one
of
these
d
this
is
a
creeper
this
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
but
carries
a
velvet
hammer
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
at
9
you
have
to
watch
out
d
9
what
this
stuff
drinks
like
uber
delicious
sparkling
cider
very
light
yet
complex
really
nice
example
of
the
style
very
impressed
pours
a
hazy
oragne
with
a
fizzy
head
nice
clove
spicy
and
yeasty
aroma
taste
is
much
of
the
same
somewhat
complex
with
a
tart
fruityness
that
has
a
cherrylike
character
but
its
hard
to
put
my
finger
exactly
on
it
and
a
slight
note
of
alcohol
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
and
really
enjoyable
to
drink
with
all
that
complexity
and
alcohol
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
its
not
overrated
smooth
and
easy
for
how
stong
the
abv
is
75cl
bottle
shared
with
larrylsb
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
lasting
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
quite
fruity
with
lots
of
tangy
apricot
and
tangerine
the
flavor
is
also
yeasty
with
some
of
that
apricot
sweetness
some
citric
tartness
and
alcohol
there
is
definitely
some
spiciness
too
fullbodied
with
lively
carbonation
when
i
added
the
yeast
at
the
end
the
alcohol
really
smoothed
out
and
this
became
a
very
nice
tripel
itd
definitely
a
rich
beer
and
one
that
needs
to
be
sipped
i
shared
a
tall
bottle
of
this
with
my
old
man
for
his
birthday
and
i
must
say
i
think
im
partially
glad
i
had
someone
to
share
the
bottle
with
but
what
can
i
say
it
went
down
smoothly
and
i
savoured
each
and
every
sip
i
didnt
want
to
waste
a
drop
without
enjoying
its
complexities
d
a
little
too
sweet
and
tart
for
my
taste
but
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
a
very
interesting
easytodrink
brew
lots
of
taste
nuances
in
a
powerful
package
i
think
that
this
may
not
be
my
absolute
favorite
style
of
beer
i
would
choose
a
double
ipa
any
day
of
the
week
however
in
the
right
setting
say
a
hot
summer
day
sitting
outside
with
friends
with
nothing
pressing
when
you
dont
mind
tying
one
on
this
is
a
great
choice
dvery
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
brew
a
sipper
for
sure
at
9
d
anytime
anywhere
id
even
drink
it
warm
the
mouthfeel
is
so
creamy
and
lush
and
the
flavor
profile
so
delicate
that
this
beer
drinks
extremely
well
however
that
9
is
no
joke
and
can
definitley
pack
a
punch
quite
easily
drinkable
and
repeatively
so
though
be
wary
9
can
creep
up
on
you
especially
when
contained
in
such
a
welllayered
beer
a
brew
to
sip
not
chug
drinkability
easy
to
drink
drink
it
slow
because
is
very
tasty
perhaps
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
some
people
complained
of
its
sweetness
but
i
just
dont
see
it
this
is
very
enjoyable
and
leaves
your
mouth
tasting
of
clove
and
orange
d
i
could
stick
with
it
for
a
while
but
i
prefer
a
good
belgian
dark
ale
to
the
tripels
d
the
abv
is
masked
well
id
say
its
easy
to
drink
in
the
tripel
catagory
drinkability
is
off
the
chart
sinfully
good
beer
have
not
had
a
bad
beer
from
unibroue
its
a
shame
about
the
alcohol
poking
its
head
out
really
but
more
than
that
its
a
disappointment
that
the
delicious
springlike
flavours
on
this
cant
overcome
otherwise
this
would
be
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
as
it
is
its
just
delicious
instead
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
an
excellent
tripel
highly
recommend
lately
ive
been
avoiding
tripels
and
this
one
makes
me
wonder
why
not
going
to
be
a
regular
in
the
rotation
but
this
should
be
worth
couple
bottles
a
year
especially
the
smaller
size
so
i
can
have
something
else
after
quite
delicious
in
the
mouth
finishes
smooth
and
replenishing
to
the
taste
buds
a
bit
of
tartness
does
not
detract
in
the
least
from
the
superior
drinkability
of
this
beer
la
fin
du
monde
is
definitely
a
great
tripel
with
fantastic
qualities
definitely
a
brew
to
be
noted
of
and
end
a
night
with
overall
happy
100th
review
to
me
and
what
a
brew
to
choose
for
it
if
this
is
the
end
of
the
world
bring
it
on
caveat
if
you
dont
read
the
label
about
the
alcohol
content
you
will
be
surprised
ironically
i
think
i
tasted
the
alcohol
more
in
the
cleaner
slightly
bitter
body
of
the
coldclear
pour
the
sediment
provides
flavors
that
mask
the
alcohol
and
warmth
seems
to
potentiate
those
other
flavors
more
than
the
alcocol
beautiful
radiant
golden
color
with
fizzy
white
head
alcohol
orange
peels
citrus
light
fruit
apple
skins
and
cloves
in
the
aroma
wow
taste
is
quite
the
eye
opener
warming
alcohol
spices
freshsqueezed
citrus
rivers
then
faint
hops
in
the
end
crisp
and
fizzy
in
the
mouth
and
greatly
refreshing
incredibly
flavored
and
a
sure
delicacy
to
be
considered
overall
im
not
sure
if
i
got
a
strange
batch
or
what
but
this
beer
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
im
a
big
fan
of
tripels
and
la
fin
kind
of
threw
me
for
a
loop
it
wasnt
bad
really
just
took
me
by
suprise
i
suppose
ill
definitely
be
trying
this
again
to
see
if
i
had
a
fluke
experience
or
what
super
drinkable
for
a
belgian
a
beer
and
style
all
in
its
own
though
i
think
more
complex
than
the
usual
and
i
can
only
compare
this
to
the
stone
vertical
that
i
tried
and
hated
but
this
is
far
better
and
actually
might
make
me
purchase
a
fine
belgian
in
the
near
future
like
this
one
doesnt
hide
its
strength
as
well
as
a
ninkasi
tricerahops
but
it
is
what
it
is
d
sublimely
drinkable
one
of
the
beers
that
truly
turned
me
on
to
the
good
stuff
would
definitely
recommend
and
will
try
again
poured
a
cloudy
blonde
with
a
thick
head
the
smell
is
the
spicy
aroma
that
i
equate
with
all
unibroue
products
very
heavy
flavor
with
cloves
and
other
spices
easily
overpowered
the
pizza
i
was
eating
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
to
warn
against
the
serious
alcohol
this
beer
packs
taste
makes
it
drinkable
carbonation
cuts
down
on
this
a
bit
as
does
the
9
abv
this
is
so
good
the
belgians
are
probably
considering
declaring
war
this
beer
is
a
favor
to
the
wallet
and
a
delight
to
the
tongue
with
that
said
la
fin
du
monde
is
easily
one
of
the
best
triples
ever
brewed
and
makes
a
strong
case
for
itself
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
brewed
its
craftsmanship
rivals
that
of
even
the
top
genuine
belgium
breweries
md
first
is
a
dry
astringent
feel
on
the
mouth
from
the
alcohol
esters
followed
by
a
smooth
finish
that
let
the
taste
buds
know
it
means
business
drinkablity
is
great
i
plan
to
buying
a
larger
amount
next
time
a
brilliant
beer
complex
spicy
and
allaround
tremendous
d
dangerous
crisp
highly
drinkable
cool
on
a
hot
day
im
having
to
force
myself
to
slow
down
because
i
know
otherwise
this
9
is
going
to
catch
up
and
kick
my
butt
na
zdravje
d
it
was
good
to
enjoy
one
or
two
but
more
than
that
its
sweetness
and
alcohol
might
get
to
you
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
great
triple
this
beer
is
an
experience
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
lively
head
and
active
carbonation
the
smell
is
ripe
with
fruit
yeast
and
spice
there
is
some
alcohol
in
the
aroma
but
i
cant
stay
mad
at
it
the
taste
is
tart
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
its
a
perfect
example
of
the
tripel
style
more
please
overall
very
interesting
beer
i
finished
this
about
an
hour
ago
and
my
palate
is
still
smashed
up
with
the
flavors
from
it
probably
wont
buy
again
due
to
the
session
capabilities
of
it
none
the
less
it
was
a
great
brew
d
extremely
drinkable
not
a
single
unenjoyable
note
i
am
highly
impressed
with
la
fin
du
monde
im
even
more
impressed
given
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
readily
available
around
home
and
at
killer
prices
6
99
for
a
750
yes
please
a
exemplary
beer
especially
paired
with
fresh
sushi
california
and
rainbow
tunasalmon
rolls
i
will
be
reserving
a
permanent
place
in
my
fridge
for
this
beer
as
my
goto
triple
drinkability
a
very
good
tripel
no
complaints
at
all
on
my
list
of
approved
tripels
lol
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
trippel
ive
tasted
darker
and
heavier
but
this
golden
version
masks
its
alcohol
perfectly

an

for
a

is

hidden
more
so
than
any
other
higher
abv
i
had
had
much
too
easy
to
quaff
bottom
line
try
this
beer
it
is
one
of
those
that
everyone
needs
to
have
tasted
at
least
once
this
beer
is
a
tripel
belgian
styledale
it
has
a
nice
orange
and
spicy
aroma
the
flavors
are
pretty
complex
and
mostly
great
to
start
you
get
nothing
except
for
a
blast
of
carbonation
that
lasts
at
least
a
second
but
finally
that
evolves
on
your
palate
first
tastes
are
of
orange
and
other
citrus
along
with
spices
noticeably
cloves
and
cinnamon
lots
of
yeasty
and
doughy
flavors
as
well
a
nice
finish
and
aftertaste
too
the
9
alcohol
warms
you
up
but
in
a
good
way
and
is
not
annoying
at
all
great
brew
overall
i
am
becoming
a
huge
fan

and
without

moderate

a

d
a
wonderful

a
great

that
drinks
easy
and
is

notes
ive
heard
this
beer
called
the
canadian
standin
for
duvel
going
down
nice
and
smooth
in
spite
of
the
big
boy
booze
quotient
its
been
their
flagship
beer
since
day
one
for
a
reason
with
a
bright
yellowish
orange
color
and
a
nice
thick
head
on
top
it
smells
potently
of
orange
not
a
lot
of
nose
but
good
carbonation
and
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
good

is
a
pretentious
beer
and
im
not
impressed
what
more
can
i
say
ill
drink
it
again
then
remains
there
throughout
great
retention
and
sticky
lacing
smells
great
honey
caramelized
banana
and
is
very
drinkable
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
but
i
also
expected
it
to
be
even
higher
as
the
robust
head
continues
to
grow
for
a
minute
or
two
and
ever
so
slowly
begins
to
deflate
into
an
offwhite
silken
custard
and
a
mild
fruitiness
a
lot
drier
than
i
anticipated
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
that
finishes
clean
high
abv
makes
it
a
slow
drinker
and
limits

i
used
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
its
a
bit
hoppy
and
thinner
than
i
expected
i
really
wanted
to
adore
this
beer
as
ive
heard
so
much
about
it

and
i
now
appreciate
it
as
a
very
good
tripel
for

has
a

54bought
this
bottle
from
crackedkettle
after
reading
and
hearing
so
much
about
it
i
thought
i
must
give
this
a
shot
d
i
was
not
overpowered
by
the
abv
and
the
beer
left
enough
room
for
a
second
would
enjoy
again
in
a
heartbeat
drinkability
good
beer
a
little
too
high
style
triple
brewed
by
unibroue
in
quebec
not
a
session
beer
obviously
but
the
noticeable
alcohol
is
handled
very
well
its
warming
and
works
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beers
characteristics
i
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
a
great
beer
the
only
issue
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
the
alcohol
content
is
noticeable
if
you
like
this
beer
try
the
rest
of
the
unibroue
beers
they
are
all
delicious
some
more
than
this
one
i
had
this
beer
at
callahans
and
it
was
served
in
a
large
bottle
with
cork
not
sure
this
is
the
regular
serving
but
it
totally
rocked
i
had
it
put
on
ice
while
at
the
bar
it
poured
very
red
and
golden
and
the
head
was
not
very
large
the
taste
was
very
good
but
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
it
was
very
rich
and
sweet
and
would
be
best
with
a
desert
it
was
a
very
strong
beer
i
only
rated
the
drinkability
a
4
because
it
is
not
something
i
would
drink
everyday
and
with
any
food
only
with
a
desert
everything
else
about
this
beer
was
perfect
it
was
recommended
by
an
old
friend
who
lived
near
the
manufacturer
drinkability
decent
i
couldnt
have
more
than
12
glasses
of
this
but
its
pretty
good
carbonation
is
a
distraction
very
effervescent
like
champage
taste
is
great
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
despite
the
high
abv
pleasant
yeast
flavor
and
delicous
overtones
of
oranges
and
lemons
excellent

hazy
orangeyyellowish
full
white

warm
alcoholfruity
aroma
with
a
yeasty
touch
warm
going
down
high
alcohol
content
obviosly
contributes
to
this
feels
similar
to
wine
in
that
aspect
for
that
reason
the
drinkability
is
hampered
but
the
taste
itself
is
a
pleasant
one
fruity
warm
flavor
with
ample
carbonation
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
drink
two
of
on
an
empty
stomach
before
dinner
you
drink
two
eat
like
a
slob
then
fall
asleep
on
the
living
room
floor
while
watching
the
evening
news
hopefully
the
kid
doesnt
start
crying
d
very
drinkable
the
construction
of
this
beer
is
not
only
doing
a
service
to
belgianstyle
ales
brewed
in
north
america
but
to
craft
beer
in
general
most
noticeable
to
me
is
the
hop
character
jumping
out
yet
blending
so
well
with
the
overall
composition
d
a
beer
that
ill
be
drinking
again
for
sure
the
9abv
is
quite
well
hidden
but
would
creep
up
on
you
pours
a
nice
golden
color
wiht
thick
head
smell
has
fruit
and
yeast
in
it
the
taste
is
really
nice
good
balance
and
a
subdued
flavoring
of
citrus
sweetness
and
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
especially
for
the
strength
and
it
makes
for
a
drinkable
beer
i
do
wish
it
had
slightly
more
character
quite
drinkable
and
soothing
considering
the
high
alcohol
content
i
would
keep
drinking
these
all
night
if
they
didnt
hit
me
so
hard
drinkability
very
good
beer
wonderful
taste
and
complexity
this
is
a
great
brew
that
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
in
the
future
very
highly
recommended
overall
an
outstanding
highly
drinkable
and
very
special
beer
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
an
everyday
beer
but
definitely
one
to
be
drank
in
place
of
a
glass
of
wine
at
a
fine
dinner
a
classy
brew
this
beer
is
very
well
done
d
decent
although
it
is
very
tasty
i
cant
give
it
a
5
due
to
the
9
that
would
be
dangerous
after
too
many
ive
done
it
quite
a
few
times
but
i
wouldnt
advocate
that
to
anyone
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
the
best
brews
ive
had
the
honor
of
consuming
and
it
always
makes
for
a
great
session
i
dig
it
im
noticing
this
is
my
first
canadian
review
this
ones
gonna
be
in
my
rotation
from
now
on
taste
is
outstanding
full
tons
of
flavors
yeasty
hoppy
flavor
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
my
stand
by
when
i
cant
decide
what
i
want
i
love
this
beer
quite
franklythis
is
not
my
type
of
beer
with
how
fruity
it
is
it
is
obviously
high
quality
but
hardly
a
beer
that
i
would
regularly
spend
the
hefty
price
of
8
for
a
25
oz
bottle
ovverall
the
best
belgian
pale
ive
had
to
date
excellent
beer
more
than
lives
up
to
the
hype
overall
bravo
if
you
are
looking
for
a
bubbly
companion
for
the
evening
maybe
something
that
has
all
the
fruit
of
a
triple
and
drinkability
of
a
duvel
this
is
your
beer
d
overall
a
good
belgian
style
ale
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
probably
buy
more
of
these
in
the
future
single

after
a

more
sips
and
after
my
palate
gets
more
used
to
what
it
is
experiencing
im
beginning
to
really
enjoy
what
is
going
on
here
im
finding
it
to
be
a
smooth
sipper
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
to
it
and
the
carbo
is
also
medium
and
it
finishes
on
the
vinuous
side
very
tasty
and
the
9abv
adds
a
nice
bit
of
warming
after
the
swallow
id
buy
this
one
again
overall
an
ok
belgian
a
bit
overpriced
though
ive
had
this
beer
before
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
actually
took
the
time
to
review
and
notice
all
its
subtle
properties
i
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
this
all
day
long
but
with
the
9
ill
need
to
take
my
time
with
it
comment
this
is
my
first
from
this
brewery
and
it
will
not
be
my
last
bubble
gum
comes
to
mind
again
malty
with
no
real
noticeable
hops
d
this
is

but
i
couldnt
detect
even
a
trace
of
alcohol
this
is
what
bspas
aspire
to
be
like
and
very
few
reach
this
pinnacle

a

some

and
maybe
a
touch
of

and
a
touch

present
as
well
the
first
sip
leaves
a
brilliant
warm
feeling
in
the
mouth
his
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
and
goes
down
smooth
leaving
a
pleasant
aftertaste
like
many
of
unibroues
other
offering
only
a
4
on
drinkability
as
2
glass
of
this
can
leave
your
head
spinning
a
terrific
beer
this
is
highly
recommended
and
it
is
laudable
that
this
belgianstyled
brew
is
from
canada
of
all
places
this
sample
is
the
second
750
ml
bottle
ive
purchased
and
i
know
that
i
will
reach
for
this
again
some
time
poured
into
a
snifter
from
a
bomber
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
forming
a
massive
3
fingers
worth
of
head
that
faded
leaving
some
medium
spots
of
lace
the
aroma
is
delicious
fruit
and
sugar
the
taste
is
very
much
the
same
consisting
of
sharp
hops
followed
by
a
sweet
candy
taste
and
finishing
with
a
very
smooth
fruity
flavor
higher
carbonation
than
expected
but
still
an
easy
drinker
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
full
flavor
and
smooth
mouthfeel
made
for
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
i
will
be
getting
this
again
this
beer
is
excellent
with
spicy
food
but
also
just
by
itself
d
this
is
a
really
world
class
beer
even
if
the
name
implies
drinking
on
at
the
end
of
the
world
it
is
just
drinkable
in
almost
every
sense
w
sweetness
belgian
character
and
spice
the
9
abv
makes
it
more
of
a
sipper
but
pure
pleasure
in
each
sip
overall
a
good
sipper
but
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
spice
to
pick
this
one
up
again
drinkability
well
this
beer
is
quite
simply
delicious
if
it
wasnt
for
the
9
abv
id
have
a
field
day
a
750ml
of
this
golden
elixir
of
the
gods
is
perfect
if
you
havent
had
this
yet
get
it

long

sipper

wears

little
to
quick
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
the
aroma
isnt
strong
at
all
but
what
i
can
smell
is
nice
mostly
theres
just
an
overall
fruity
and
sweet
smell
along
with
some
cloves
honey
pear
and
yeast
luckily
the
taste
is
stronger
it
tastes
like
fruit
cloves
pepper
and
honey
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
a
little
too
much
but
not
enough
that
it
takes
away
from
the
beer
the
drinkability
is
still
pretty
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
alcohol
isnt
noticable
at
all
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
aroma
wasnt
strong
but
the
taste
and
overall
drinkability
made
up
for
it

about
it
i
tell
you
though
the
alcohol
in
this
one
hits
you
quite
rapidlyi
get
a
decent

buzz
rather
quickly
due

the
high

reedit
my
opinion
of
this
beer
just

i
disagree
with
a

of
what
i
have
originally
written
about
it
in
sum
this
is
a
delicious
beer
in

i
just

a
wood
floor
im
tired
as
hell
really
i
just
wanted
a

to
put

but
this
thing
is
so
tasty
and
the
qualities
so
evident
it
just
makes
me
smile
pours
a
hazy
strawlike
yellow
with
a
pillowy
head
that
dies
to
a
nice
lace
smells
of
sweet
fruit
yeast
clove
and
tea
tastes
of
spicy
clove
malt
pear
tea
feel
full
in
the
mouth
with
a
lively
tickle
on
the
tongue
from
carbonation
finishes
a
little
dry
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
a
big
warming
effect
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
and
a
delight
to
drink
i
love
unibroue
period
all
their
offerings
are
unique
and
interesting
it
opens
my
mind
to
whats
possible
i
do
like
some
of
the
others
better
then
this
one
the
spicyness
kind
of
turns
me
off
but
otherwise
its
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
in
the
mouth
the
brew
is
of
a
lighter
body
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
than
i
would
expect
for
the
style
the
beer
finishes
fairly
spicy
and
a
bit
dry
but
not
too
dry
this
is
a
beer
that
id
drink
just
about
any
time
not
sure
if
i
prefer
it
over
duvelsure
theyre
not
the
same
but
they
do
have
similaritiesbut
in
my
book
it
is
definitely
the
same
quality
i
see
the
two
as
interchangeable
great
beer
i
tried
this
at
a
beef
fest
about
six
months
ago
and
really
liked
it
i
saw
this
on
the
menu
last
night
and
couldnt
wait
to
try
it
in
a
much
larger
quantity
it
didnt
disappoint
very
nice
pour
with
a
perfect
smell
for
a
belgian
pale
tastes
delicious
and
was
smooth
the
whole
way
down
not
a
bad
brew
just
ok
and
quite
overrated
imo
drinkability
this
beer
is
fantastic
just
when
you
think
canada
has
nothing
but
hockey
strange
brew
and
rush
you
find
this
d
could
drink
this
one
all
night
if
i
didnt
have
pure
abbey
style
ales
around
me
but
great
and
tasty
reproduction
of
the
beglain
style
yum
im
giving
an
average
drinkability
because
while
the
alcohol
doesnt
affect
the
taste
at
all
the
beer
is
too
tangy
to
give
it
a
high
drinkability
rating
though
it
is
still
a
great
beer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
there
is
really
something
to
be
said
for
the
head
offered
by
different
brewing
styles
this
is
a
light
almost
out
of
body
feel
that
makes
me
very
pleased
that
i
have
another
full
pint
glass
of
frothy
goodness
waiting
for
me
in
the
oversized
bottle
dont
pass
this
one
by
because
before
you
know
it
its
la
fin
du
monde
the
end
of
the
world
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
too
easy
it
is
not
heavy
or
filling
at
all
this
could
be
a
session
beer
if
you
had
nowhere
to
go
highly
recommended
every
country
has
their
brewers
who
try
to
recreate
belgiums
best
and
unibroue
does
it
consistently
brew
after
brew
canada
should
be
proud
along
with
maudite
these
two
beers
are
perfect
examples
yet
different
than
the
best
that
belgium
has
to
offer
i
have
had
several
dozen
bottles
of
this
beer
and
every
time
it
leaves
me
all
warm
and
fuzzy
especially
those
750
ml
it
is
relatively
cheap
and
ohh
soo
good
eh
god
love
canada
for
this
one
for
9
99
a
4pack
its
a
bargain
and
im
in
love
with
it
so
my
score
is
biased
sorry
you
may
want
to
read
the
next
one
for
objectivity
tastes
wet
sweet
with
strong
fruity
some
dried
hay
and
quite
a
bit
of
phenol
i
have
a
hard
time
with
phenol
and
this
beer
is
difficult
for
me
to
handle
yeasty
serves
to
temper
the
sweet
and
a
strong
sting
from
carbonation
lifts
the
thickness
from
the
tongue
abv
must
be
about
10
but
is
quite
well
integrated
with
the
other
flavors
clean
without
fusels
aftertaste
is
increasingly
drying
with
an
unpleasant
phenol
and
aromatic
oil
that
contributes
a
numbing
or
dulling
effect
md
body
and
heavily
carbonated
very
well
balanced
with
an
interesting
story
of
flavors
rising
and
falling
judged
to
style
not
to
my
particular
preferences
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
ill
probably
finish
this
750ml
without
to
much
trouble
has
a
hoppy
bite
on
the
tongue
along
with
the
warming
alcohol
and
some
spice
that
lingers
a
truly
remarkable
beer
and
this
one
should
make
any
canadian
proud
d
for
a
beer
of
this
complexity
drinkability
is
high
i
split
a
750
ml
bottle
with
another
person
and
i
can
still
feel
the
alcohol
i
could
surely
have
more
of
this
beer
for
the
taste
but
it
is
potent
stuff
im
sure
one
whole
bottle
is
enough
very
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
comes
out
much
more
than
in
the
maudite
its
darker
sister
and
is
less
complex
than
maudite
also
still
preferable
over
a
delirium
tremens
and
is
quite
delicious
during
hot
summer
days
a
very
good
brew
poured
into
a
glass
and
the
drink
had
a
faint
gold
color
with
a
nice
head
that
dissapated
slowly
smell
is
reminiscent
of
the
other
unibroue
lines
i
have
tried
not
that
i
am
complainingfruity
the
taste
was
excellent
no
aftertaste
very
smooth
i
could
definetly
drink
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
can
find
it
i
could
do
some
serious
damage
to
myself
probably
if
i
ever
saw
this
on
tap
surprisingly
light
bodied
and
despite
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
it
really
does
not
give
away
its
9
abv
an
eminently
drinkable
belgian
style
beer
12oz
brown
bottle
with
silver
foil
at
the
neck
and
a
label
of
quebec
surrounded
with
glowing
light

with
a
clovey

winey

lemony
taste
upfront
with
belgian
yeast
funk
trailing
it
up
dryish
sweet
finish
with
a
rounded
tang
at
9abv
this
beer
at
first
seems
a
duvel
clone
but
a
closer
taste
reveals
far
more
belgian
yeast
character
that
includes
a
sourness
and
a
wet
blanket
funk
this
complexity
makes
this
beer
a
must
try
try
it
with
seafood
dishes
herbed
vegetables
cheese
courses
or
as
a
nightcap
sipper
pours
with
a
furious
white
head
of
tight
dense
bubbles
which
stick
to
the
glass
while
the
carbonation
remains
active
for
quit
some
time
color
is
a
luminescent
soft
yellow
nose
is
a
true
bouquet
with
natural
suggestions
of
lime
banana
herbs
and
more
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
very
fruityciderlike
with
a
full
mouthfeel
and
spicy
finish
which
hides
the
high
alcohol
content
very
well
alcohol
burn
is
noticeably
absent
for
a
9
beer
certainly
give
this
a
try
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
bellywarmer
a
winner
of
a
belgian
from
unibroue
pours
a
pale
straw
hue
with
the
clarity
greatly
disturbed
by
the
expressive
carbonationanother
gusher
the
fizzy
snowwhite
head
eventually
drops
to
a
sturdy
cap
leaving
weak
lacing
pils
malt
hay
earthy
yeast
tones
and
clean
alcohol
are
the
most
apparent
aromas
with
belgian
phenols
and
candyish
esters
become
more
pronounced
as
the
bouquet
opens
up
big
tworow
sweetness
and
sharp
pils
malt
upfront
followed
by
sugary
esters
and
typical
unibroue
phenolics
there
is
some
lemongrass
and
peach
fruitiness
in
the
back
coupled
with
a
strong
earthy
yeast
character
that
segues
into
a
mellow
but
full
noble
hop
flavorbitterness
the
hop
presence
is
probably
not
needed
to
balance
the
taste
given
the
drying
alcohol
and
spiciness
in
the
aftertaste
but
is
a
nice
accent
to
an
already
complex
melange
of
flavors
the
body
is
very
thinneddown
from
presumably
viscous
and
highly
carbonated
the
crisp
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
works
well
with
the
unibroue
house
yeast
but
it
also
helps
offset
the
considerable
residual
sweethess
left
over
as
well
as
lift
some
of
the
phenols
before
they
become
obtrusive
this
ale
posesses
all
the
delicate
flavors
i
have
found
in
other
unibroue
beers
but
is
less
abbrasive
in
its
alcohol
perception
with
a
less
aggressive
yeast
pattern
the
finish
is
surprisingly
managable
given
the
strength
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
bspa
ive
tried
easy
to
see
why
this
is
the
most
popular
unibroue
ale
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
head
which
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
sticks
to
the
glass
some
apple
in
the
aroma
mixed
in
with
hops
and
alcohol
the
first
taste
is
amazing
as
good
as
anything
ive
had
in
ages
apple
spice
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
some
yeast
very
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
for
such
a
strong
beer
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
some
nice
carbonation
on
the
tongue
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
long
time
but
it
was
worth
the
wait
i
would
add
some
more
to
this
review
but
the
more
i
drink
the
harder
it
is
to
write
coherently
so
ill
just
leave
it
at
this
this
is
one
of
the
worlds
really
great
beers
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
pale
gold
color
strong
alcohol
aroma
with
hints
of
spice
and
apple
along
with
yeast
malt
and
some
hops
taste
is
well
balanced
with
hints
of
apple
banana
clove
malt
and
yeast
with
that
alcohol
finish
at
9
very
drinkable
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
either
complex
and
absolutely
delicious
an
outstanding
belgian
ale
d
fair
due
to
the
high
alcohol
and
the
complexity
but
still
a
very
good
brew
from
unibroue
final
statement
a
very
well
put
together
belgian
styled
pale
a
good
drink
pretty
high
drinkability
for
the
style
my
favourite
from
this
brewer
which
means
a
lot
because
theyre
a
very
respectable
company
top
notch
this
brew
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
perfect
10
head
into
my
unibroue
tulip
glass
aromas
are
light
citric
fruits
figs
honey
malted
grains
and
a
dash
of
brown
sugar
in
there
the
taste
is
also
light
the
alcohol
is
hiding
well
out
of
sight
with
citrus
fruits
dominating
the
palate
the
finish
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
slight
bite
as
it
goes
down
yes
definitely
a
topnotch
brew
from
those
crazy
canadians
an
altogether
excellent
beer
from
unibroue
good
drinker
recommended
i
can
see
this
as
a
gateway
beer
into
the
more
sour
beverages
i
see
more
experienced
tasters
seem
to
have
a
thing
for
bottle
smell
is
very
earthy
hopped
with
slight
molasses
and
spices
into
my
chalice
it
pours
to
a
very
cloudy
pale
yellow
the
head
is
plentiful
but
dissappears
quickly
mouthfeel
is
tremendous
the
high
ac
is
very
evident
the
carbonation
is
high
but
is
a
good
compliment
to
the
heartiness
of
this
brew
the
intial
tartness
and
spicy
taste
is
followed
by
a
neutral
bitterness
this
is
the
closest
thing
to
a
good
homebrew
that
ive
ever
had
a
good
starter
beer
but
the
drinkability
will
be
low
due
the
extremely
high
ac
con
cuidado
this
brew
will
knock
your
socks
off
this
is
a
great
beer
that
always
finds
its
way
into
my
refridgerator
pairs
well
with
pesto
and
salmon
d
exceptional
taste
but
a
bit
flavorful
and
strong
to
be
drunk
in
quantity
quite
a
complex
and
enjoyable
ale
bought
a
four
pack
of
bottles
for

99
at
a
local
liquor
storewanted
a
beer
with
a
kick
this
beer
has
a
great
appearance
with
a
dishwatercloudy
gold
appearance
and
thick
head
after
intial
pour
that
dissipates
slowly
with
medium
bubbles
strong
citrus
malt
smell
taste
is
not
bad
for
alcohol
content
and
flavors
mimic
the
scents
but
a
background
bitterness
that
leaves
a
slight
aftertaste
usually
killed
after
having
the
second
one
the
mouth
feel
is
near
perfect
and
it
is
easily
drinkable
but
be
wary
if
all
you
wanted
was
a
two
beer
buzz
bc
it
goes
down
easy
and
its
kick
is
hard
will
buy
again
delightful
unibroue
is
one
of
if
not
the
premium
brewery
in
north
america
imho
and
la
fin
is
their
premiere
brew
pours
a
cloudy
golden
good
lasting
foam
aroma
contains
tinges
of
apple
citrus
some
lemon
taste
is
crisp
clean
excellent
fruitiness
without
cloying
sweetness
light
tasty
and
drinkable
excellent
paired
with
a
meal
of
fish
or
chicken
the
best
feature
of
this
ale
is
the
way
it
covers
a
complete
taste
spectrum
without
heaviness
or
leaden
weightiness
unibroues
maudite
and
trois
pistoles
are
both
close
seconds
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
beer
right
off
the
bat
it
pours
out
of
the
bottle
like
champagne
in
a
moviescene
once
poured
its
a
gorgeous
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
sweet
hints
of
caramel
a
bit
of
floral
hops
and
a
rather
strong
scent
of
spice
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
the
caramel
coming
out
a
bit
more
the
spice
holding
its
own
and
the
hops
taking
a
definite
backseat
to
the
sweet
fruity
flavor
applebanana
this
ones
hard
to
pin
down
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
it
goes
down
smooth
drinkability
is
a
bit
too
good
for
such
a
high
abv
this
one
is
very
easy
to
overdrink
with
despite
that
its
still
a
great
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
having
it
quite
a
bit
more
in
the
future
the
end
of
the
world
nice
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
the
9
hides
from
you
until
the
end
crisp
bite
at
the
end
is
wonderful
it
literary
bellowed
out
of
the
bottle
nice
thick
head
that
left
soap
like
stains
on
the
glass
smells
of
yeast
and
fruit
i
had
this
beer
about
5
years
ago
and
forgot
how
good
it
really
is
my
favorite
so
far
from
unibroue
more
to
come
750ml
d
not
bad
but
the
overpowering
rose
flavor
may
tire
theyve
done
this
style
well
it
reminds
me
of
chimay
and
duvel
enjoy
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
a
rich
hazy
golden
color
gave
off
a
very
thick
nice
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
was
very
lively
some
great
fruit
smells
citrus
and
something
heavier
fig
or
raisins
and
a
nice
spicy
scent
as
well
taste
is
pretty
much
as
good
as
it
gets
same
type
of
stuff
as
the
scent
only
more
pronounced
on
the
palate
than
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
goes
down
smooth
excellent
beer
d
quite
good
especially
because
of
the
light
body
and
thoroughly
refreshing
nature
eric
first
off
the
cork
blows
out
of
these
babes
like
they
were
champagne
the
pour
is
exceptional
beautiful
foggy
gold
with
a
serious
offwhite
cratered
head
from
those
big
healthy
bubbles
that
hangs
around
quite
a
while
thick
lacing
as
i
have
noted
childhood
allergies
completely
screwed
my
sense
of
smell
but
the
fruitiness
couldnt
be
missed
maybe
raspberries
i
cant
really
say
but
if
i
can
smell
it
its
there
the
mouth
feel
is
full
plenty
of
carbonation
though
it
sure
doesnt
get
in
the
way
it
seems
like
every
taste
bud
is
located
and
activated
lingering
and
lingering
kicking
up
the
initial
rush
yeasty
but
not
in
your
face
some
sweetness
but
not
at
all
cloying
its
a
little
peppery
on
the
tongue
and
closes
with
a
nice
warmth
pleasant
rather
calm
for
a
9
abv
everything
fits
so
nicely
in
this
beer
if
it
were
female
it
would
be
powerful
sultry
and
smooth
at
the
top
of
the
pale
ale
pile
ill
be
drinking
this
a
bunch
until
recently
i
had
been
a
bit
reluctant
to
try
unibroues
beers
due
to
the
majority
of
their
labels
looking
like
art
from
a
cheesy
death
metal
album
however
the
adage
of
not
judging
a
book
by
its
cover
has
never
been
more
true
there
is
no
doubt
i
will
be
trying
this
beer
again
very
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
one
of
the
worlds
great
beers
imo
d
a
fine
brew
but
dare
i
say
i
prefer
delirium
tremens
this
is
just
a
touch
too
tart
for
my
tongue
compared
to
others
the
beer
looks
great
and
i
wouldnt
knock
it
back
but
i
would
take
a
tremens
before
it
la
fin
du
monde
screams
belgium
straight
from
the
heart

well
with
a
name
like
la
fin
du
monde
made
it
screams
frenchcanadian
done
in
a
belgian
style
but
that
doesnt
sound
quite
as
sexy
i
dont
care
its
excellent
under
any
name
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
most
other
beers
from
unibroue
d
this
is
a
rather
drinkable
brew
but
the
alcohol
gets
you
in
the
end
a
very
potent
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
overall
i
like
it
very
much
however
due
to
its
high
abv
9
i
would
not
suggest
to
drink
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
if
you
would
like
to
keep
your
composure
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
and
perfect
for
a
hot
day
pretty
drinkable
considering
its
9
certainly
too
strong
to
session
but
i
could
drink
two
or
three
overall
very
good
beer
recommended
overall
im
still
in
complete
and
utter
amazement
with
unibroue
and
their
superior
lineup
of
immaculate
brews
a
round
of
applause
for
the
fine
folks
in
chambly
quebec
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
its
9
0
alcohol
content
by
volume
makes
it
one
that
you
wouldnt
want
to
drink
all
day
but
this
is
a
damn
solid
beer
highly
recommended
see
you
again
in
about
a
year
for
bottle
4
the
end
of
the
world
eh
this
baby
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
huge
snowwhite
head
takes
a
good
while
before
it
dies
down
to
a
good
lacing
with
quite
a
bit
of
stickiness
smell
is
definitely
a
fluffy
yeast
with
bananas
and
a
smokey
scent
as
well
a
tiny
hint
of
alcohol
seems
to
tingle
the
nose
as
well
taste
has
nice
balance
between
the
clovey
yeast
and
the
mandarine
hop
flavoring
a
bit
of
metallic
tingles
in
the
mouth
as
well
alcohol
flavor
is
present
but
not
overpowering
at
all
finishes
somewhat
dry
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
high
carbonation
they
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
for
this
style
at
9
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
know
it
wont
be
my
last
this
beer
pours
a
mild
paleish
color
i
never
realized
it
was
a
pale
ale
let
alone
a
strong
pale
ale
and
i
have
had
it
in
the
past
strong
aroma
with
hints
of
spice
and
apple
along
with
malt
and
some
hops
taste
is
somewhat
mild
with
a
very
raisin
like
consistency
mixed
in
with
alcohol
again
very
strong
and
interesting
for
a
belgianstyle
pale
ale
at
9
very
drinkable
and
not
quite
for
the
faint
of
heart
either
complex
yet
delicious
definitely
something
different
for
a
pale
ale
let
alone
a
strong
pale
ale
d
due
to
a
high
abv
of
9
and
the
rich
and
brilliant
flavors
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
while
smoking
a
pipe
but
not
one
to
take
to
a
college
party
this
was
tonights
great
find
at
whole
foods
in
jericho
ny
as
i
was
thinking
about
a
tripel
it
poured
with
an
extra
foam
that
took
a
while
to
settle
so
i
just
inhaled
it
in
deep
appreciation
the
first
taste
was
like
the
last
until
i
got
to
the
extra
yeast
section
a
plentiful
array
of
sweet
malts
the
tangs
of
hops
and
the
slightly
sour
elements
came
together
in
a
great
tasting
ale
it
must
be
stellar
on
tap
this
is
a
very
special
beer
i
opened
the
bottle
to
the
smell
of
new
belgiums
abbey
double
the
smell
was
clean
and
balanced
nothing
stuck
out
the
taste
is
very
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
hint
of
ginger
and
sweet
alcohol
as
pointed
out
before
what
impressed
me
the
most
about
this
brew
was
its
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
this
feels
like
a
slightly
flat
champagne
and
ends
very
crisp
this
drinks
like
a
normal
beer
but
has
twice
the
alcohol
very
nice
will
try
to
brew
some
of
my
own
at
9
this
beer
dont
seem
that
high
good
stuff
but
i
tend
to
like
the
darker
belgians
more
i
would
reccomend
to
any
belgian
lover
but
its
nothing
to
go
out
and
hunt
down
this
was
a
rather
complex
and
excellent
offering
a
variety
of
tastes
experiences
sensations
ebbs
flows
etc
made
for
a
great
beer
experience
be
warned
that
it
does
drink
much
easier
than
the
high
abv
it
is
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
d
i
cant
tell
this
is
9
abv
and
it
is
very
delicious
i
will
try
this
one
again
another
great
offering
from
unibroue
hazy
straw
yellow
out
of
the
bottle
not
much
head
lots
of
bubbles
continuously
rise
aroma
is
bready
and
strongly
sweetly
alcoholic
flavor
is
tart
and
sweet
and
bready
in
the
finish
in
looks
and
taste
this
beer
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
hefeweizen
after
warming
there
is
a
slight
buttery
winelike
flavor
up
front
some
citrus
notes
also
start
to
come
out
as
it
warms
drinkability
tasty
belgian
ale
very
drinkable
a
lot
of
fruity
flavor
packed
into
this
one
la
fin
du
monde
really
holds
its
own
in
the
belgian
strong
pale
category
despite
the
serious
competition
at
the
top
i
will
absolutely
revisit
this
beer
again
and
again
fantastic
beer
with
my
admittedly
brief
experience
with
belgianstyle
ales
i
have
to
say
that
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
that
not
much
beats
a
great
bspa
this
one
is
fantastic
highly
highly
recommended
d
put
this
on
my
wants
list
this
beer
pours
a
very
nice
pale
straw
gold
color
with
a
thick
2
finger
pure
white
head
the
head
falls
a
bit
but
can
be
quickly
called
back
by
swirling
the
glass
leaving
tons
of
lace
the
smell
is
dominated
by
the
unibroue
yeast
with
a
bit
of
summer
fruit
underneath
there
seems
to
be
three
separate
taste
phases
with
this
beer
first
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
with
orange
and
tangerine
flavors
second
a
good
deal
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
touch
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
is
noticed
both
of
these
flavors
are
subtle
but
they
do
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
lastly
i
get
nice
tart
lemon
along
with
a
bit
of
grain
and
peppery
spice
a
bit
of
clove
and
banana
are
present
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
with
lively
carbonation
a
powdery
dry
finish
and
a
pleasant
aftertaste
drinkability
ranks
very
high
interesting
complexity
with
hidden
alcohol
makes
this
highly
quaffable
if
the
end
of
the
world
were
imminent
i
would
be
drinking
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
ive
tried
it
numerous
times
and
still
dont
think
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
its
pretty
with
a
tall
white
head
and
hazy
straw
yellow
body
it
smelled
sweet
and
spicy
corriander
with
a
similar
flavor
i
just
find
the
flavor
to
fall
flat
i
get
some
but
not
a
great
complexity
out
of
it
still
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
with
little
hint
of
the
alcohol
id
probably
go
for
duvel
instead
of
this
though
d
excellent
if
it
werent
for
the
high
price
tag
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
9
be
damned
this
thing
did
kick
my
ass
at
the
end
of
the
night
however
so
watch
out
poured
a
delicious
looking
golden
yellow
with
2
finger
of
head
which
dissolved
quickly
leaving
no
lace
on
top
a
great
smell
floral
and
fruity
but
not
quite
as
fruity
as
an
average
weiss
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
delicious
fruity
with
banana
taste
and
orange
hint
sugaryyeasty
at
first
taste
i
thought
it
was
slightly
too
carbonated
but
as
i
drank
it
the
bubbly
texture
really
started
to
compliment
the
tangy
taste
leaving
a
sharp
impression
on
my
tongue
no
taste
of
alcohol
anywhere
a
well
crafted
beer
leaving
me
a
very
happy
drinker
d
solid
beer
easy
to
drink
easy
to
put
back
a
750ml
bottle
at
9abv
and
not
notice
d
this
one
is
dangerously
good
this
might
just
be
my
desert
island
beer
i
was
wowed
by
this
back
in
1996
and
i
am
wowed
by
it
now
a
masterpiece
despite
its
alchohol
content
id
actually
consider
it
a
session
beer
as
its
very
easy
to
drink
im
not
sure
how
long
you
would
be
coherent
for
at
9
but
up
until
that
moment
of
blackout
youd
be
enjoying
every
sip
d
ive
enjoyed
this
one
on
many
occasions
and
will
continue
to
do
so
as
its
a
solid
beer
that
always
satisfies
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
especially
given
the
alcohol
level
a
great
and
wellcrafted
example
of
the
style
id
have
a
hard
time
finding
something
of
this
stylestrength
combination
that
is
also
this
drinkable
in
a
word
5
this
was
fantastic
poured
a
deep
hazy
and
very
light
amber
with
a
big
white
frothy
head
quick
fade
left
behind
a
nice
quarter
inch
layer
of
head
on
top
and
nice
lace
down
the
glass
smell
was
very
alive
lots
of
figs
and
pears
with
hints
of
raisin
and
plum
lots
of
carbonation
gave
this
a
great
feel
and
only
served
to
punctuate
the
great
flacors
lots
of
light
fruitness
here
again
peachs
pears
figs
hints
at
nutmeg
and
some
grape
extrodinarily
drinkable
with
no
hint
whatsoever
of
the
big
alchol
in
this
quite
possibly
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
belgian
style
ales
this
was
fantastic
nothing
over
the
top
just
crafter
perfectly
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
md
very
light
on
the
pallet
lots
of
bubbles
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
with
the
alcohol
hidden
well
a
great
beer
to
turn
people
on
to
belgians
with
easy
to
see
why
it
is
rated
in
the
top
of
its
style
again
i
really
should
have
started
drinking
unibroue
a
long
time
ago
great
beer
at
great
prices
drinkability
ill
find
out
in
a
few
hours
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
drinking
it
was
a
nice
experience
couldnt
drink
too
many
though
poured
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
its
a
bright
yet
cloudy
orange
color
had
a
nice
foamy
white
head
not
as
big
as
other
belgians
and
didnt
take
as
long
to
dissipate
not
much
in
the
way
of
the
lacing
department
the
smell
is
of
all
things
that
make
up
a
belgian
ale
spicy
and
sweet
a
nice
powerful
aroma
the
taste
is
of
orange
peel
tartness
of
granny
smith
apples
cloves
belgian
yeast
the
feel
is
moderate
and
well
carbonated
champagne
like
a
very
flavorful
ale
and
worthy
of
another
purchase
however
it
doesnt
rank
up
there
with
my
favorites
due
to
the
strong
orange
peel
flavor
and
champagne
like
carbonation
the
flavor
is
an
apple
tartness
and
lingering
hop
spiciness
i
detect
some
other
fruits
in
there
too
maybe
raisins
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
with
a
full
body
accompanied
by
very
nice
tartness
and
tanginess
there
is
some
warming
alcohol
flavor
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
this
one
finishes
strong
thanks
for
making
me
try
this
one
again
beer
buddies
poured
into
tuliip
glass
enormous
head
took
several
minutes
to
die
down
aroma
is
sweet
fruit
and
huge
musty
yeast
taste
is
banana
cloves
pineapple
white
pepper
and
alcohol
very
sweet
the
comparison
to
cake
batter
is
not
unwarranted
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
carbonation
is
just
right
very
drinkable
although
i
think
two
would
do
it
for
me
in
a
session
due
to
the
abv
very
interesting
very
pleasant
beer
but
i
like
it
this
beer
does
not
allow
itself
to
be
guzzled
it
forces
you
to
take
it
in
small
sips
allowing
for
nice
waves
of
flavor
exceptional
no
wonder
the
germans
lost
the
war
sitting
on
their
arses
drinking
beer
like
this
in
belgium
would
take
the
fighting
edge
off
of
any
soldier
a
great
canadian
brew
ok
quebec
well
let
you
stay
so
long
as
we
can
get
this
brew
out
west
drinkability
this
is
almost
sessionable
the
only
deterrent
is
the
abv
at
first
glance
this
could
pass
for
a
run
of
the
mill
hefe
given
the
cloudy
yellowish
color
and
one
inch
foamy
head
the
taste
at
first
could
also
be
a
bit
deceiving
in
that
it
has
a
natural
carbonation
that
is
refreshing
and
clean
this
beer
is
not
your
typical
hefe
in
that
it
is
quite
a
bit
stronger
has
much
more
of
a
bite
a
stronger
mouth
feel
may
be
a
little
sweeter
and
retains
its
natural
carbonation
a
little
longer
than
a
typical
hefe
would
this
is
a
very
good
beer
very
enjoyable
and
one
that
i
would
go
back
to
again
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
the
brewery
makes
quality
beers
and
fin
du
monde
is
one
of
their
better
products
lchaim
drinks
a
bit
slow
im
sure
this
is
better
more
matured
i
fear
this
bottle
has
been
opened
at
least
a
year
too
early
truly
a
classic
in
nearly
all
aspects
one
of
the
best
strong
belgian
pales
west
of
the
atlantic
12oz
brown
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
7609
pours
a
hazy
medium
yellow
with
a
two
finger
head
ok
longevity
and
good
lace
aromas
of
citrus
and
bready
malts
smells
refreshing
upon
tasting
its
almost
saison
like
some
yeastiness
mixed
with
citrus
bready
malts
with
a
definate
alcohol
presence
fairly
easy
drinking
considering
its
abv
a
well
made
and
tasty
beer
taste
is
masked
by
the
carbonation
at
first
but
gets
better
as
it
sits
wheat
citrus
and
tart
alcohol
notes
pull
through
mouthfeel
is
juicy
and
smooth
very
carbonated
throughout
with
a
nice
strong
bite
on
the
end
despite
the
complexity
and
decent
taste
of
this
belgian
strong
its
a
bit
much
to
imagine
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
setting
so
many
things
going
on
in
delicate
ways
soft
silky
mouthfeel
spices
like
vanilla
and
clove
perhaps
leather
and
fruity
bubblegum
as
well
and
then
there
is
the
lurking
alcohol
what
alcohol
try
standing
up
drinkability
drinkable
and
enjoyable
in
moderation
i
cant
imagine
having
more
than
oh
2
of
these
in
a
night
its
no
problem
putting
down
one
i
could
do
another
but
beyond
that
it
gets
a
little
dangerous
due
to
the
high
abv
will
i
seek
this
one
out
again
perhaps
but
not
in
the
immediate
future
a
light
gold
in
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
disapates
quickly
aroma
scense
of
honey
fruit
a
difinate
belgian
style
a
spike
of
carbonation
releasing
fruity
flavors
and
a
note
of
cloves
having
a
light
med
mouthfeel
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
it
portrays
but
i
loved
every
one
i
tried
so
far
at
7
99
a
4
pack
i
think
its
a
steal
d
flavorful
without
being
overpowering
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
la
fin
du
monde
goes
well
with
fish
and
chips
although
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
anything
this
brew
sure
lives
up
to
its
reputation

canadians
have
a
winner
here
slàinte
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
as
a
750
ml
bottle
that
was
way
too
much
a
12
oz
is
about
all
you
would
want
the
flavor
is
complex
laced
with
sugars
and
a
bit
of
cooked
corn
which
is
definitely
a
negative
i
suppose
i
should
have
had
this
before
have
a
westmalle
tripel
not
a
fair
fight
eh
rather
sweet
and
almost
cloying
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
for
this
strength
of
beer
which
adds
to
drinkability
but
im
still
left
with
that
cooked
corn
character
haunting
my
palate
that
almost
has
me
wanting
me
to
pour
this
out
the
westmalle
may
have
ruined
my
palate
for
this
beer
but
im
shocked
at
how
poorly
it
measures
up
luckily
unibroue
makes
a
great
beer
that
is
accessible
so
la
fin
du
monde
is
a
great
choice
for
any
night
the
color
is
exceptional
bubbly
strawcolored
the
smell
is
great
with
ripe
fruit
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
strong
initial
flavor
carbonation
is
strong
at
first
but
it
settles
quickly
drinkability
its
a
beer
that
you
can
always
drink
even
if
it
was
the
end
of
the
world
overall
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
best
belgianstyle
ales
brewed
in
all
of
north
america
d
really
great
beer
after
smelling
it
i
just
hoped
the
taste
would
live
up
to
it
and
amazingly
it
was
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
no
matter
the
high
alcohol
content
the
cellar
comment
is
compliments
of
feedback
enthusiastically
endorsed
in
the
cellaring
forum
people
speak
of
this
aging
well
over
up
to
10
years
im
setting
down
my
stock
to
see
how
it
goes
over
time
as
well
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
for
years
to
come
with
flavors
that
saturate
a
massive
three
finger
offwhite
head
erupts
on
top
of
a
straw
colored
hazzy
orange
body
bubbles
do
disipate
rather
quickly
though
nose
is
a
very
invigorating
spicey
wheat
mix
very
floral
with
hints
of
vanilla
smooth
and
zesty
with
amazing
balance
as
it
enters
the
mouth
raw
wheat
with
nice
compliment
of
spice
and
mellow
honey
notes
warms
the
belly
well
but
the
alchol
is
very
well
disguised
amazingly
drinkable
with
a
charmingly
clean
mouthfeel
a
truely
delecious
brew
overall
an
exceptional
example
of
the
style
very
tasty
very
agreeable
one
of
my
favorites
a
good
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
try
it
again
fruity
beers
just
dont
do
it
for
me
but
its
the
best
one
i
have
had
so
far
dangerously
easy
to
drink
another
great
unibroue
offering
but
don
de
dieu
is
a
little
better
on
my
opinion
d
very
drinkable
with
a
great
complexion
to
it
the
combination
of
the
carbonation
and
the
flavors
just
make
this
beer
pop
cheers
taste
is
also
of
yeastiness
although
the
flavor
is
not
tremendously
complicated
like
other
tripels
ive
had
there
is
not
a
lot
of
spiciness
however
the
taste
is
simple
pleasant
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
evervescent
and
refreshing
i
really
like
this
beer
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
also
warming
works
on
s
cold
winter
night
or
a
hot
summer
morning
in
a
word
awesome
drinkability
probably
among
the
top
five
bspas
made
and
so
cheap
its
just
silly
just
an
allaround
treat
nothing
to
complain
about
and
much
to
love
cant
recommend
it
highly
enough
not
my
favorite
from
unibroue
but
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
for
me
la
fin
du
monde
is
a
treat
to
have
it
gives
off
aromas
consisting
of
orange
rinds
and
freshly
baked
doughy
breads
the
brew
produces
a
pure
white
frothy
head
that
lasts
quite
a
while
the
body
is
quite
cloudy
due
to
the
yeasts
left
behind
every
time
i
take
a
sip
it
feels
like
im
biting
into
candied
orange
slices
with
a
moderate
ginger
spice
this
feels
a
bit
chewy
at
first
but
seems
to
melt
in
my
mouth
this
is
a
greatly
refreshing
brew
even
with
the
moderate
alcohol
content
this
could
easily
be
enjoyable
on
a
warm
summer
evening
this
offering
is
sent
directly
to
us
from
the
great
country
of
quebec
one
has
to
wonder
will
its
pale
orange
appearance
and
citrusy
aroma
leave
me
disappointed
or
will
it
deliver
on
all
that
has
been
promised
oh
oui
kudos
on
a
beer
well
built
i
do
enjoy
maudite
more

ah
what
a
beer
lovely
white
foam
slowly
makes
it
way
down
the
glass
inviting
you
to
drink
the
brew
at
first
it
smelled
and
tasted
more
like
a
triple
the
flowery
aromas
almost
startling
but
as
this
beer
settlled
in
the
glass
i
could
smell
more
the
of
malt
kind
of
a
crystalized
sweetness
i
just
loved
this
beer
it
was
complex
and
simple
it
found
the
right
balance
as
it
warmed
slightly
it
became
even
richer
as
most
beers
of
this
quality
will
do
an
incredibly
smooth
beer
for
such
high
alcohol
content
the
heavy
yeast
the
intially
hit
me
also
subsided
leaving
this
a
wonderfully
inviting
ale
d
a
very
tasty
beer
i
will
have
this
one
again
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
with
a
beautiful
creamy
pure
white
head
the
head
retains
well
and
the
lacing
is
decent
but
a
little
spotty
smell
isnt
bad
there
just
isnt
much
of
one
faint
hints
of
clove
and
other
yeasty
estersand
not
too
much
more
the
taste
is
better
and
rather
subtle
the
alcohol
is
well
camoflauged
and
there
are
nice
yeast
notes
of
clove
bubblegum
and
spice
the
finish
is
long
and
creamy
nice
mouthfeel
but
perhaps
could
use
a
little
more
bite
quite
drinkable
maybe
too
much
so
poured
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
yeasty
estery
belgian
aroma
subtle
with
a
multitude
of
notes
banana
and
honey
among
them
taste
was
a
little
sweet
for
my
own
liking
but
probably
not
a
flaw
and
it
was
nicely
balanced
with
a
sour
middle
bite
and
a
dry
finish
another
complex
challenging
brew
from
the
folks
at
unibroue
pours
out
of
the
750
ml
bottle
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
sun
colour
a
thin
carbonation
induced
head
appears
and
dies
down
to
a
thin
lace
fruity
esters
in
the
nose
banana
clove
etc
dominate
the
aroma
oh
so
nice
peppery
and
malt
notes
dominate
the
flavour
profile
i
love
the
fruity
spicy
and
yeasty
nuances
just
a
damn
tasty
belgian
strong
pale
ale
lemon
pepper
seems
to
dominate
and
i
love
it
i
like
the
fact
that
the
carbonation
doesnt
overpower
the
senses
in
a
champagne
sort
of
way
while
the
actual
beer
can
speak
for
itself
that
might
be
the
difference
between
the
belgian
duvel
and
the
north
american
la
fin
du
monde
interpretations
of
the
style
regardless
i
love
the
body
of
this
beer
and
think
the
mouthfeel
might
be
perfect
for
this
style
even
though
i
havent
much
experience
in
said
style
drinkability
is
great
id
love
an
endless
supply
no
matter
what
the
season
especially
in
summer
smell
was
fruity
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
was
fresh
and
clear
with
alcohol
finish
a
great
example
of
the
belgian
style
the
alcohol
keeps
it
from
being
a
real
session
beer
for
me
but
for
a
great
taste
it
is
a
good
one
a
must
try
if
there
is
anyone
out
there
left
who
hasnt
already
had
one
or
twelve
this
is
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
tasty
brew
the
abv
is
probably
a
little
high
to
be
sessionable
but
having
a
couple
of
these
is
very
enjoyable
a
really
good
belgian
style
pale
ale
and
another
winner
from
a
great
brewery
d
you
have
to
be
careful
with
this
one
because
even
though
it
has
a
high
alcohol
percentage
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
end
of
the
world
pours
a
hazy
pale
strawgolden
color
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
that
recedes
to
about
14
and
doesnt
disappear
the
aroma
seems
to
be
that
of
apricot
cider
pepperspice
and
yeast
funk
among
other
things
the
flavor
comes
on
with
an
estery
fruity
malt
presence
pepper
and
clove
follow
along
with
a
bit
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
very
complex
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
lots
of
carbonation
despite
the
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
tried
this
beer
not
knowing
what
to
expect
as
i
was
not
familiar
with
this
company
the
1st
bottle
was
opened
and
the
smell
was
enticing
my
1st
thought
was
this
is
going
to
be
good
and
i
was
right
tasted
good
in
my
mouth
and
went
down
nice
and
smooth
i
am
looking
forward
to
sampling
more
from
this
brewer
i
tried
this
from
the
bottle
at
our
company
christmas
party
i
was
in
charge
of
the
beer
so
it
worked
out
nicely
i
loved
popping
the
cork
and
bumping
a
ceiling
tile
out
of
place
when
it
jetted
up
from
the
bottle
poured
into
the
glass
and
got
about
34
of
an
inch
head
it
looked
like
a
nice
wheat
beer
with
bright
straw
yellow
color
i
got
a
hint
of
verbena
in
the
nose
the
flavor
seemed
to
be
a
cross
between
a
light
sour
belgian
and
a
hefeweizen
with
lemon
pretty
darn
refreshing
for
a
relatively
serious
beer
definitely
would
have
it
again
and
again
overall
better
than
i
expected
and
if
i
had
something
to
celebrate
like
a
visit
to
quebec
id
drink
this
all
night
finances
permitting
its
rare
enough
to
even
find
it
in
australia
if
any
distributors
are
reading
this
please
send
more
to
canberra
last
time
ive
seen
it
was
around
2000
great
beer
note
the
bottle
was
highly
carbonated
and
the
beer
foamed
up
and
out
this
happened
with
all
4
beers
in
the
pack
and
i
did
not
shake
it
at
all
this
could
have
been
an
error
from
the
store
or
a
defective
bunch
but
it
was
not
a
great
way
to
begin
this
beer
what
a
great
beer
like
a
hefeweizen
on
steroids
i
will
have
more
of
this
thanks
to
my
son
for
a
nice
early
christmas
gift
this
is
only
my
second
pale
belgian
strong
the
other
being
duvel
which
i
enjoyed
but
this
is
first
rate
la
fin
du
monde
is
really
quite
drinkable
and
considering
the
advertised
9
abv
potentially
dangerous
there
are
few
9
beers
that
i
could
immediately
stomach
another
of
but
la
fin
du
monde
is
one
of
them
dogfish
90
minute
is
another
drink
this
canadian
nectar
at
your
own
peril
a
damn
good
beer
but
more
along
the
style
of
a
saison
or
belgian
golden
ale
than
a
triple
poured
to
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
good
carbonation
and
a
thick
white
head
that
lingered
then
dissipated
to
little
lacing
aroma
was
very
pleasant
spices
clove
and
coriander
with
a
hint
of
apples
taste
was
more
of
the
spices
and
a
hint
of
cookie
dough
mouthfeel
was
tingly
as
a
result
of
the
spices
and
the
finish
was
smooth
and
a
little
warming
due
to
the
9
abv
left
a
lingering
spicy
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
triple
fermented
bottle
conditioned
belgian
blonde
in
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
is
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
large
rocky
white
head
that
quickly
disintegrates
into
almost
nothing
at
all
the
smell
is
both
spicy
and
floral
with
hints
of
hops
and
orange
peel
the
carbonation
is
initially
very
aggressive
and
reminiscent
of
champagne
as
this
beer
warms
and
the
initial
high
carbonation
subsides
the
mouthfeel
moves
from
light
bodied
to
medium
the
taste
is
mostly
bittersweet
and
touch
metallic
the
finish
is
dry
but
mildly
bitter
and
alcoholic
overall
a
good
beer
if
you
like
the
bspa
style
otherwise
it
may
be
a
bit
much
for
the
uninitiated
not
my
favorite
of
the
unibroue
crew
but
still
a
tasty
belgian
style
ale
from
n
america
there
is
a
nice
complexity
of
flavor
despite
the
light
character
of
the
ale
but
if
you
dont
like
coriander
this
probably
isnt
for
you
nicely
done
quebec
drinks
all
too
well
thanks
to
each
sip
being
charmed
along
by
that
wonderful
smell
and
finish
the
actual
body
of
this
beer
could
be
better
but
the
aroma
could
not
nice
looking
bottle
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
a
white
sparkling
head
the
smell
is
almost
like
a
hefe
sweet
with
banana
and
clove
belgian
sugar
taste
is
also
strong
on
the
clovespice
with
no
real
hop
taste
and
only
a
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
burns
the
tongue
the
overall
drinkability
is
reduced
by
the
very
strong
clovespice
taste
overall
i
think
youre
better
off
with
maudite
pours
a
nice
orange
gold
color
with
a
2
finger
thick
foamy
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
very
floral
with
fruits
apricots
some
floral
hops
some
banana
and
yeast
taste
starts
with
some
subdued
floral
hops
then
moves
back
to
the
fruits
i
noticed
in
the
smell
some
apricots
some
banana
some
green
apple
a
bit
of
grain
and
some
yeast
good
mouthfeel
good
amount
of
carbonation
light
crisp
very
refreshing
great
drinkability
surprsingly
easy
to
drink
the
9
abv
could
easily
sneak
up
on
you
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
this
beer
is
every
bit
as
good
as
i
remember
this
beer
is
malty
sweet
with
a
medium
dryness
the
flavor
is
a
thorough
blending
of
banana
and
clove
a
bright
fruit
flavorstrawberrycherry
a
sharp
yeast
note
and
dry
grainy
malt
the
flavors
dont
really
stand
out
individually
but
that
was
my
crapshoot
guess
as
to
what
might
make
this
flavor
mouthfeel
is
average
i
think
for
the
style
but
the
drinkability
is
great
the
9abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
overall
it
is
unfathomable
that
this
beer
is
9
alcohol
the
balance
is
exquisite
only
wish
there
was
more
complexity
this
beer
is
exemplary
of
the
style
and
remarkably
drinkable
considering
its
high
abv
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
finer
belgian
strong
golden
ale
available
tried
this
at
a
restaurant
served
in
the
12
oz
bottle
no
date
on
the
bottle
9
abv
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
appearance
is
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
tall
head
consisting
of
tiny
bubbles
great
retention
smells
crisp
and
clean
citrus
pine
yeasty
tastes
of
orange
yeasty
a
bit
bready
grapefruit
lemon
slight

mouthfeel

all
the

excellent

beer
with
dinner
wonderfully

12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
duvel
glass
gusher
pretty
clear
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
aroma
of
alcohol
herbs
and
spice
sugar
the
flavor
is
pretty
alcoholic
with
a
long
burn
sweet
lemony
flavor
maybe
too
sweet
high
carbonation
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
heard
alot
about
this
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
at
pazzos
in
lexington
ky
has
a
nice
yellowish
color
with
a
wonderfully
full
whitish
head
smells
of
citrus
and
spice
nice
fruit
taste
definetly
citrusy
not
what
i
expected
alcohol
is
hidden
very
nicely
for
9
percent
fills
the
mouth
just
right
had
two
of
these
and
was
certainly
impressed
and
buzzed
very
well
crafted
beer
a
delicate
hand
is
required
to
pour
this
one
the
billowy
white
head
rests
on
the
cloudy
orange
beer
the
head
leaves
a
nice
lacing
along
the
glass
it
has
a
very
floral
and
spicy
smell
some
hints
of
alcohol
and
yeast
are
also
noticeable
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
complex
yet
well
balanced
consisting
mostly
of
a
spicy
and
sweet
tones
the
carbonation
first
tingles
in
the
mouth
then
finishes
off
spicy
this
is
an
interesting
style
that
i
always
enjoy
and
always
wish
i
had
more
a
brew
thats
both
engrossingly
complex
and
light
on
its
feet
with
very
little
of
the
rottenoxidative
notes
that
ruined
the
trois
pistoles
for
me
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
that
ive
enjoyed
many
bottles
of
many
times
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
i
do
like
it
a
whole
whole
lot
note
all
4s
are
a
conscious
decision
for
each
category
and
not
just
me
going
down
the
list
let
this
sit
in
your
mouth
for
awhile
swallow
then
take
a
deep
breath
through
your
mouth
and
you
will
know
perfection
drink
slowly
and
with
great
respect
as
there
is
not
a
better
tasting
beer
on
the
planet
poured
into
a
snifter
style
glass
very
cloudy
completely
opaque
and
golden
in
color
there
is
indeed
quite
a
bit
of
yeast
in
this
brew
initially
the
beer
was
chilled
dont
know
approx
temperature
and
gradually
warmed
during
the
drinking
session
it
barely
had
a
head
which
soon
disappeared
a
bit
unfortunate
though
i
quite
enjoyed
the
opaque
cloudiness
and
it
did
have
a
quite
pleasant
smell
the
taste
was
very
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
bitter
when
it
was
chilled
the
flavor
was
more
restrained
yet
reminiscent
of
apples
as
it
warmed
up
it
had
more
of
a
heavier
banana
flavor
both
the
flavor
and
the
feel
of
it
carbonation
immediately
reminded
me
of
champagne
though
the
comparison
follows
only
to
a
point
this
has
definite
crossover
appeal
considering
the
flavor
mouthfeel
as
well
as
the
presentation
both
the
caged
and
corked
bottle
as
well
as
the
appropriate
glasswear
along
with
stones
double
bastard
and
russian
imperial
stout
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
and
nut
brown
ale
and
orvals
trappist
ale
this
is
truly
my
favorite
beer
so
far
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
substantial
frothy
white
head
that
lingers
nicely
nose
is
of
apples
with
some
citrus
notes
and
displays
the
complexity
of
a
fine
wine
taste
is
wellbalanced
with
some
initial
banana
notes
leading
to
a
sweet
and
complex
finish
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
since
it
varies
in
description
and
sensation
minute
by
minute
but
always
pleasing
feels
great
in
the
mouth
steady
stream
of
bubbles
from
center
of
tulip
and
so
drinkable
that
its
dangerous
truly
a
remarkable
brew
this
is
a
nice
foamy
smooth
beer
in
the
mouth
goes
down
way
too
easy
for
its
9
abv
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
little
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
i
cant
picture
the
drink
location
for
this
hot
day
i
dont
think
this
is
a
winter
beer
poured
out
a
lemongolden
color
with
a
bubbling
head
head
calms
to
a
thick
cap
of
bubbly
foam
good
lacing
smells
of
sherry
port
apple
cider
citric
and
bready
tastes
light
and
fruity
with
a
slight
citric
hop
character
finishing
with
pepper
and
alcohol
notes
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
light
and
refreshing
excellent
beer
i
am
glad
i
finally
made
the
plunge
very
drinkable
even
with
9
alcohol
this
is
a
world
classic
and
with
due
respect
toward
the
also
excellent
duvel
quite
possibly
the
gold
standard
of
the
style
the
beer
poured
a
rich
old
gold
with
a
good
amount
of
effervesence
developoing
a
fine
white
head
with
a
few
tan
hints
in
it
the
aroma
was
of
citrus
bananna
and
sweet
malt
underneath
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
some
bananna
this
is
followed
by
a
blast
of
spice
and
an
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
the
feel
is
smooth
oily
and
effervescent
this
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
a
fine
example
of
a
style
that
goes
down
easily
my
first
trippel
and
purchased
due
to
rave
reviews
from
friends
initial
pour
had
lots
of
white
head
yellowirange
in
color
aroma
of
citrus
at
first
but
with
another
smell
i
was
able
to
pick
out
some
bananas
active
palate
with
plenty
of
carbonation
had
a
yeasty
citrusy
taste
finish
was
bitter
and
alcoholic
at
first
i
wasnt
that
big
a
fan
but
as
i
sipped
more
i
enjoyed
it
and
detected
some
peppery
taste
i
guess
im
not
much
of
a
coriander
guy
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
last
of
the
750
ml
bottle
a
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
golden
with
lovely
thick
creamy
head
banana
spice
some
sour
notes
bubblegum
in
both
smell
and
taste
intense
flavours
my
wife
reckons
rhubarb
but
im
not
so
sure
strong
alcohol
is
noticeable
sweet
on
finish
then
lingering
bitterness
lovely
fine
carbonation
oily
mouthfeel
an
excellent
beer
but
alcoholic
taste
may
limit
how
many
can
drink
this
one
definitely
lived
up
to
its
hype
plenty
of
fruity
flavors
along
with
hidden
alcohol
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
of
strong
belgian
ales
go
get
it
now
d
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
as
expected
but
as
it
warms
becomes
pleasant
and
understated
complex
beer
d
easy
and
refreshing
i
will
pick
this
up
sometime
next
summer
very
crisp
citric
mouthfeel
with
a
subtle
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
very
palatable
and
drinkable
the
only
hindrance
being
the
strong
abv
excellently
crafted
and
balanced
its
brews
like
this
that
make
brewing
seem
like
a
true
art
form
wow
my
first
unibroue
and
im
hooked
very
very
smooth
creamy
with
citrus
notes
bannana
and
clove
all
good
things
love
it
but
not
as
much
as
i
love
having
3
more
in
the
fridge
not
overly
familiar
with
the
style
i
was
really
suprised
at
the
alcohol
content
its
extremely
smooth
for
being
9
drinkability
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
good
work
unibroue
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
everyday
pretty
nice
head
with
good
carbonation
nice
aroma
with
hints
of
bannana
now
for
the
first
taste
of
the
night
i
find
this
to
have
a
nice
fruity
character
with
a
slight
warming
aftertaste
i
really
am
surprised
by
the
9
abv
this
beer
hides
it
s
strength
well
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
for
this
brew
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
overall
an
excellent
beer
way
too
easy
to
drink
given
its
abv
d
a
great
belgian
pale
with
phenomenal
fruity
character
and
fantastic
balance
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
one
with
a
10
abv
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
them
before
noticing
how
drunk
you
are
perfect
texture
with
spoton
carbonation
a
wonderfully
balanced
body
all
put
together
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beverage
although
that
is
at
least
held
in
check
by
its
powerful
9
abv
the
best
ive
had
from
unibroue
thus
far
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
great
beer
i
dont
think
it
could
get
any
better
wow
d
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
the
potency
and
excellent
melding
of
flavors
make
this
particular
brew
very
easy
to
drink
not
to
heavy
and
not
to
light
it
nailed
the
right
combination
very
drinkable
for
the
style
i
was
ready
for
a
second
glass
d
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
not
because
of
the
alcohol
but
because
i
wouldnt
want
to
ruin
the
moment
extremely
drinkable
and
a
complex
taste
lead
to
one
of
my
favorite
yearround
brews
the
alcohol
is
apparent
extremely
welcome
however
what
a
beautiful
taste
the
unique
yeast
strain
balanced
malt
and
hops
and
a
slight
tartness
the
spicing
is
just
perfect
it
has
the
drinkability
of
a
thirstquenching
witbier
in
a
very
complex
gourmet
beer
this
could
be
enjoyed
with
about
any
dish
youd
like
strong
enough
to
stand
with
aged
cheese
but
smooth
and
quaffable
enough
to
enjoy
with
fish
or
a
salad
after
a
few
sips
gets
a
peppery
aftertaste
d
despite
strong
yeast
presence
and
high
abv
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
beers
on
lees
to
drink
i
know
from
experience
in
my
youth
as
i
would
split
a
six
pack
with
a
friend
and
get
quite
drunk
for
the
moment
enjoying
a
single
beer
with
my
meal
and
feeling
great
final
verdict
very
enjoyable
alcohol
is
well
hidden
an
exellent
pairing
with
strong
flavored
cheese
as
reviewer
prior
stated
didnt
have
the
aftertaste
of
high
alcohol
content
notes
overall
a
fine
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
partake
in
multiples
of
this
one
in
a
session
though
not
for
the
alcohol
content
mind
you
but
more
for
the
pervading
sweetness
of
the
drink
i
tasted
none
of
the
tartness
that
some
of
the
other
reviewers
detected
however
i
still
have
3
brews
to
go
so
i
shall
update
the
review
as
needed
note
one
of
the
greatest
beers
i
have
had
to
date
very
complex
taste
i
enjoyed
this
beer
from
start
to
finish
worth
evey
penny
i
paid
for
it
highly
recommended
very
drinkable
if
you
want
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
the
whole
experience
of
drinking
beer
not
good
for
a
six
pack
during
a
ball
game
and
nachos
if
i
were
rating
taste
based
on
this
beer
vs
other
unibroue
beers
id
give
it
a
5
but
since
im
rating
to
style
and
to
my
personal
preferences
im
giving
it
a
3
5
its
definitely
drinkable
and
i
cant
say
i
dislike
it
but
given
the
evergrowing
number
of
beers
i
truly
enjoy
and
the
nearly
infinite
number
of
beers
ive
yet
to
try
i
probably
wont
be
laying
down
any
more
dough
for
this
brew
again
any
time
soon
while
i
am
not
very
experienced
with
the
style
i
liked
it
for
what
it
was
a
new
experience
and
an
obviously
well
crafted
beer
i
cant
say
i
am
hooked
on
the
style
or
this
beer
but
it
makes
for
an
interesting
tasting
experience
i
will
be
trying
this
again
down
the
road
to
rate
this
beer
i
am
rating
it
based
on
the
very
little
i
know
and
how
i
enjoyed
the
experience
the
fact
that
this
thing
has
aroma
and
flavors
all
over
the
place
scores
hi
with
me
it
is
certainly
multideminsional
edit
101708
very
interesting
to
try
this
after
much
more
beer
tasting
experience
still
a
great
beer
but
have
tasted
many
better
sunce
i
wrote
the
review
the
flaw
here
is
that
the
brew
is
too
sweet
i
have
adjusted
my
ratings
today
maybe
the
best
beer
ive
had
so
far
since
discovering
craft
beers
smells
like
banana
cloves
and
some
apricot
but
this
is
definetly
the
most
complex
beer
ive
tasted
i
first
tasted
pineapple
apricots
bubblegum
sour
apples
then
the
medium
hopy
bitterness
hit
me
i
didnt
taste
any
alcohol
until
i
was
almost
finished
with
the
bottle
drinkability
is
high
i
seriously
could
go
for
another
one
but
ill
be
passed
out
on
the
floor
midway
through
the
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
pours
hazy
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
yeasty
and
reminds
me
a
citrus
fruits
maybe
pineapple
yeasty
flavors
tartness
are
present
and
alcohol
isnt
as
apparent
as
i
would
expect
but
its
there
along
with
hop
biterness
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
somewhat
thin
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
considering
the
alcohol
content
p
s
i
did
this
about
a
year
ago
and
now
i
know
how
horriable
corriander
is
if
you
use
it
in
every
damn
beer
you
brew
appearance
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
frothy
white
head
the
head
goes
down
some
but
lasts
throughout
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
of
citrus
the
taste
is
peppery
and
of
yeast
citrus
especially
pineapple
is
evident
i
had
this
right
out
of
the
fridge
and
it
got
smoother
as
it
warmed
alcohol
can
be
sensed
but
its
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
but
pleasant
drinkability
is
very
good
especially
for
a
9
0
abv
lfdm
may
be
too
sweet
for
some
but
i
found
it
very
well
balanced
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
have
again
highly
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
the
pour
into
a
shaker
raises
a
one
inch
plus
head
off
white
very
solid
but
becomes
rocky
over
time
recedes
to
a
still
very
thick
layer
that
lasts
the
whole
glass
the
body
is
hazy
yellow
translucent
the
nose
is
yeasty
sweet
a
bit
peppery
slightly
hoppy
the
taste
echoes
the
smell
with
a
focus
on
pepper
and
yeast
characteristics
the
mouth
is
medium
but
the
carbonation
is
a
tad
too
high
for
me
the
yeast
adds
more
fun
to
the
drink
when
poured
in
a
tasty
brew
and
quite
good
with
vodka
sauce
l
f
d
m
pours
a
moderately
cloudy
light
honey
color
with
a
generous
frothy
and
slightly
chunky
head
that
settles
into
a
creamyfoamy
slick
vivacious
carbonation
ascends
from
all
sectors
of
the
glass
luxurious
nose
of
honeyed
grapefruit
and
banana
with
essences
of
clove
allspice
and
a
hint
of
coriander
wrapped
around
the
fresh
yeast
an
element
of
lime
rind
and
citric
acids
adds
brightness
to
the
mouthfeel
a
very
nice
brew
reminiscent
of
brewery
ommegangs
hennipen
drinkability
is
also
wonderful
this
brew
is
incredibly
tasty
and
enjoyable
to
drink
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
too
many
of
these
this
quebecoise
is
fantastique
i
wish
i
had
a
bowl
of
poutine
to
go
with
it
cheers2beers
i
have
had
this
beer
before
but
mixed
with
many
others
and
it
didnt
really
take
me
by
storm
this
time
concentrating
on
it
alone
it
was
a
delight
i
defintely
see
more
in
my
futureuntil
the
world
ends
anyway
which
could
be
any
day
now
but
this
is
great
beer
to
drink
while
everything
is
crumbling
around
you
the
beer
was
a
medium
body
that
left
a
nice
warming
feeling
in
the
mouth
from
the
high
alcohol
it
was
a
wonderful
brew
that
must
be
taken
with
respect
and
sipped
throughout
the
night
warning
if
you
havent
tried
belgian
style
ales
and
do
not
want
to
pay
the
high
price
demanded
for
them
8
00
do
not
try
this
beer
as
it
is
highly
addictive
drinkability
fantastic
dangerously
easy
to
drink
though
the
sweetness
definitely
caught
up
with
me
by
the
end
of
a
glass
slightly
abrasive
grassiness
and
mild
but
dry
finish
certainly
kept
this
pleasant
taste
very
fruity
with
oranges
and
lemons
and
theres
some
other
fruits
that
i
cant
quite
place
the
spices
and
sweetness
are
almost
to
overwhelming
for
me
some
alcohol
makes
its
presence
felt
in
the
aftertaste
pretty
strongly
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
with
the
sweetness
and
abundance
of
spices
this
is
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
drink
d
the
alcohol
in
this
is
masked
so
well
making
this
a
highly
drinkable
belgian
but
the
spices
would
hold
me
to
just
one
an
excellent
beer
overall
i
was
wondering
what
all
the
fuss
was
over
unibroue
now
i
know
d
this
is
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
imagine
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
a
surprising
highly
drinkable
treat
and
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
a
stark
testimonial
to
the
quality
of
unibroue
overall
wow
i
just
cant
get
over
the
quality
of
this
beer
you
must
try
this
beer
if
you
like
strong
belgian
style
ales
just
amazing
strong
to
say
the
least
nice
mixture
of
lots
of
flavors
though
feels
really
good
so
its
easy
to
drink
but
the
9abv
is
going
to
limit
the
intake
to
a
certain
degree
high
quality
stuff
a
regular
in
my
beer
fridge
and
another
reason
unibroue
is
such
an
incredible
brewery
this
wasnt
as
good
as
i
expected
the
smell
was
the
dominate
part
of
this
brew
the
taste
and
smell
were
way
off
from
each
other
not
a
bad
brew
overall
i
just
thought
it
wasnt
as
good
as
it
seemed
oh
well
was
worth
the
try
ill
be
returning
to
this
one
the
smell
is
great
like
fruits
nuts
and
spices
sort
of
reminds
me
of
christmas
the
taste
is
beyond
expectations
simply
put
the
best
belgin
beer
brewed
outside
belgium
now
thats
saying
a
lot
and
the
price
is
nice
too
compared
to
the
expensive
imports
from
belgium
i
could
drink
these
all
the
time
but
they
can
fil
you
up
pretty
fast
but
i
would
recomend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
a
good
beer
overall
this
beer
has
a
very
pleasant
flavor
even
if
it
isnt
my
favorite
unibroue
offering
the
sweet
and
spice
are
the
dominant
flavors
which
makes
it
a
bit
unbalanced
for
a
belgian
strong
pale
in
my
opinion
even
so
if
this
were
my
beer
during
the
end
of
the
world
i
would
certainly
be
content
to
check
out
on
this
note
pours
a
bright
goldenyellow
with
just
a
touch
of
cloudiness
and
a
giant
largebubbled
pure
white
head
that
lasts
well
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
smell
is
crisp
and
fruity
with
citrus
and
pineapple
obvious
along
with
a
yeasty
tone
and
some

well
crafted
and
greatly
appreciated
i
would
have
rated
the

higher
on
this

it
werent

the

this
is
a
very
nice
smelling
beer
citrus
fruit

clove

apparent
has
that
typical
belgian

character
in
the
flavor
some
citrus

fruit
flavors
are
noticeable
and
some
alcohol
toward
the
end
too
bubblegum
also
seems
to
appear
and
disappear
quickly
in
the
flavor
the
carbonation
is
quite
active
and
is
prickly
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
highly
recommended
this

the

persisted
for

hung
around
for
about
5
minutes
but
dissipated
quickly
after
i
have
read
about
insane
carbonation
but
the
head
in
my
glass
was
tame
a
beautiful
honeyyellow
color
with
a
few
shades
of
orange
trying
to
show
through
heavy
carbonation
on
the
palate
but
pleasant
yeast
and
alcohol
are
immediately
present
but
the
alcohol
is
not
overbearing
i
had
to
let
this
beer
sit
and
mellow
to
get
some
sweet
malt
to
come
through
all
the
yeast
i
caught
a
whiff
of
hops
as
it
warmed
but
not
much
bitterness
to
taste
i
could
drink
two
at
a
sitting
but
this
ale
on
lees
will
warm
you
up
my
first
unibroue
and
it
was
excellent
la
fin
du
monde
is
a
great
brew
its
certainly
one
of
the
best
beers
to
come
out
of
canada
but
realistically
its
not
something
that
anyone
could
ever
drink
regularly
this
is
a
special
treat
a
beer
you
keep
in
the
fridge
for
a
special
occasion
graduation
the
end
of
exams
finding
a
job
its
not
for
sipping
in
front
of
the
television
this
beer
did
have
very
impressive
characteristics
but
the
taste
just
did
not
suit
me
glad
i
tried
it
though
if
i
have
one
complaint
its
that
this
bottle
is
overly
carbonated
the
taste
is
smooth
but
all
the
bubbles
exploding
in
my
mouth
adds
harshness
that
impairs
drinkability
a
bit
a
truly
great
beer
and
a
great
belgian
beer
from
canadaboyam
i
pleasantly
surprised
overall
a
fantastic
brew
and
a
great
value
drinkability
the
only
thing
that
detracts
from
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
the
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
you
can
taste
it
and
so
youre
conscious
of
how
much
alcohol
youre
consuming
very
good
beer
overall
one
of
my
favorite
if
not
favorite

in

but
not

crisp

im
too
enthralled
to
give
a
better
review
in
words
but
my
taste
buds
are
singing
oelergud
the
only
knock
i
had
against
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
thinner
than
expected
and
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
overdone
otherwise
i
would
consider
this
beer
to
be
in
a
category
all
its
own
md
medium
body
and
creamy
mouthfeel
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
i
would
enjoy
this
again
after
a
nice
dinner
drinkability
this
is
good
goes
down

great
to

just
a
great

if

havent
tried
this
wonderful
belgian
style
ale
from

it
might
damn
well
be
the
end
of
your
particular

nice

with
a

taste
and

burnmostly
due
to
the
high
percent
an
excellent
north
american
belgian
style
beer
you
wouldnt
know
that
it
wasnt
belgian
if
not
for
the
label
a
fantastic
choice
for
a
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
meal
i
would
recommend
this
with
any
smoked
seafood
as
the
nutty
flavor
would
help
the
smoke
flavor
come
out
in
the
meal
poured
from
a
corked

into

easy
to
drink

a
superb
beer
try
the
end
of
the
world
today
it
took
me
24
years
to
find
my
first
one
of
these
it
probably
wont
take
nearly
as
long
to
find
the
second
one
cheers
drinkability
is
okay
like
i
said
im
not
a
huge
belgian
pale
fan
but
this
one
comes
across
nicely
balanced
and
well
flavored
the
prickly
feel
on
the
tongue
and
stomach
warming
nature
hurt
this
a
bit
i
just
think
that
a
clean
light
flavor
natured
beer
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
shouldnt
feel
heavy
on
the
stomach
salud
d
very
nice
not
my
favourite
unibroue
offering
but
no
complaints
honestly
i
prefer
the
maudite
from
unibroue
but
thats
like
saying
i
prefer
lobster
to
cavier
this
is
delicious
beer
that
begs
to
be
savoured
this
is
a
beer
i
am
going
to
have
to
revisit
as
i
dont
have
the
pallete
to
pick
out
all
the
flavors
very
enjoyable
but
dangerous
especially
because
the
drinkability
is
so
high
this
pours
a
orange
yellow
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
the
carbonation
is
seen
with
all
the
bubbles
its
almost
champagne
like
the
smell
is
unbelievable
the
first
scent
that
comes
out
is
the
strong
candy
sugar
along
with
lemon
pepper
and
cloves
the
taste
has
a
real
sweet
candy
sugar
flavor
along
with
pepper
yeast
wheat
and
citrus
flavors
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
are
very
well
mixed
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
there
is
almost
no
smell
or
flavor
of
the
alcohol
this
is
an
excellant
beer
that
deserves
its
high
praise
among
my
favorites
la
fin
du
monde
never
disappoints
me
when
im
thirsty
for
an
outstanding
beer
very
drinkable
beer
even
at
9
0
abv
refreshing
and
tasty
looks
like
i
was
wrong
aboot
those
canadians
id
always
wanted
to
try
one
of
these
beers
from
unibroue
finally
decided
to
give
it
a
try
and
picked
this
one
on
a
whim
i
was
extremely
pleased
an
excellent
ale
that
will
surely
catch
your
attention
if
you
try
it
i
will
definitely
be
having
this
again
drinkability
excellent
beer
and
must
try
the
best
part
is
that
every
good
beer
store
would
have
some
in
stock
i
could
have
another
one
and
im
betting
that
this
beer
would
really
sneak
up
on
you
after
a
few
all
in
all
great
beer
which
showcases
the
unique
belgian
yeast
and
candi
sugar
not
as
good
as
maudite
by
the
same
brewer
but
definitley
worth
trying
if
you
havent
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
particular
brew
again
because
of
the
price
but
i
am
very
impressed
so
far
with
this
brewery
very
very
drinkable
if
you
really
wanna
rock
little
carbonation
but
a
perfect
medium
body
that
doesnt
overwhelm
you
fiercely
easy
drinking
for
a
9
belgian
strong
pale
alcohol
is
barely
noticable
even
after
warming
and
it
doesnt
get
mundane
overall
a
great
belgian
strong
pale
heartily
recommended
i
still
prefer
unibroues
trois
pistoles
a
strong
dark
however
again
i
could
smell
this
forever
i
was
ready
for
more
after
this
bottle
i
will
seek
this
out
again
one
of
my
new
favorites
cellaring
some
to
discern
the
effects
of
age
on
this
special
brew
near
ideal
as
it
is
though
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
022309
it
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
there
are
all
types
of
things
in
the
smell
some
banana
some
orange
and
a
bit
of
clove
the
taste
is
sweet
and
spicy
the
tight
carbonation
really
adds
to
the
peppery
bite
the
sweetness
is
like
a
clementine
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
plenty
of
carbonation
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
warming
from
the
9
but
all
the
flavors
hide
it
in
the
taste
poured
into
a
tulip
with
a
goldenlight
orange
body
and
a
beautiful
three
finger
head
aroma
is
a
wonderful
mixture
of
pears
bananas
and
yeast
and
other
fruits
taste
much
like
the
smell
as
it
has
an
array
of
fruits
and
a
very
crisp
finish
this
is
a
sensational
beer
that
actually
resembles
a
hefeweizen
in
both
smell
and
taste
definately
a
worldclass
offering
from
unibroue
and
a
must
try
i
like
this
and
will
look
for
another
bottle
hopefully
fresher
d
the
yeast
character
masterfully
disguises
the
alcohol
content
which
along
with
the
smoothness
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
this
was
the
first
beer
that
ive
had
from
unibroue
it
has
left
me
with
the
impression
that
this
brewery
doesnt
mess
around
drinkability
this
is
an
awesome
beer
respect
it
a
brilliant
pour
nice
with
a
thin
frothy
head
comprised
of
smallish
white
bubbles
the
color
is
straw
yelloworange
amzingly
clear
i
could
actually
view
an
upside
down
transposition
of
the
spurs
mavericks
game
in
the
convex
of
my
snifter
kinda
neat
the
smell
is
faint
very
little
if
any
aroma
for
my
nose
a
bit
of
soft
yeasty
sugar
and
some
grassy
organic
notes
the
taste
is
a
knock
out
a
great
smooth
sweet
fruity
beginning
a
nice
flowing
center
where
the
alchohol
becomes
more
pronounced
but
not
overbearing
then
a
mildly
dry
finish
gives
way
to
the
creamy
yeast
notes
really
good
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
creamy
which
is
offset
nicley
by
the
tingle
of
carbonation
that
rises
while
to
beer
is
in
your
mouth
an
unbelievably
drinkable
masterpiece
almost
quaffable
at
what
9
abv
remeber
to
call
a
cab
if
you
are
out
with
this
one
this
was
okay
i
suppose
ale
from
here
in
north
america
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
out
again
overall
in
my
view
the
best
abbey
triple
available
in
ohio
beers
from
unibroue
are
usually
found
here
in
very
good
condition
unlike
some
of
the
true
belgians
which
sometimes
sit
on
store
shelves
for
months
or
longer
with
wide
variations
in
storage
temperature
this
is
simply
an
outstanding
beer
and
the
epitome
of
the
style
wow
im
truly
impressed
by
this
beer
before
this
i
like
many
others
sadly
thought
labat
and
molson
was
about
it
when
it
came
to
canadian
beer
im
anxious
to
try
some
other
unibroue
offerings
great
allaround
beer
that
becomes
and
instant
classic
for
me
drinkability
oh
so
good
and
it
makes
me
feel
good
overall
a
strong
contender
in
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
category
i
enjoy
duvel
more
but
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
given
the
strength
of
this
beer
i
was
quite
surprised
by
the
taste
and
drinkability
of
it
although
it
is
strong
this
aint
your
brown
bag
beer
this
one
is
great
for
sipping
anytime
would
drink
again
thx
d
very
good
drinkability
the
high
abv
catches
up
to
you
quickly
best
in
moderation
drinkability
great
goes
down
easy
i
have
pretty
well
destroyed
a
750
ml
in
the
last
45
minutes
so
watch
out
it
is
easy
to
drink
quick
but
a
shame
to
not
enjoy
maybe
i
should
have
chilled
it
at
least
a
few
minutes
pretty
decent
beer
not
the
greatest
thing
ever
in
my
opinion
but
pretty
darn
good
this
is
a
big
beer
lots
of
yeast
clove
spiciness
and
banana
nice
golden
haze
head
goes
byebye
really
quickly
good
lacing
while
it
lasts
as
with
most
unibroue
beers
there
is
almost
too
much
carbonation
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sour
finish
seems
more
like
a
tripel
than
a
strong
pale
ale
12
oz
bottle
best
before
61206
enjoyed
on
11705
pours
a
murky
pale
yelloworange
with
a
medium
sized
fizzy
white
head
mostly
diminishing
aroma
is
banana
orange
lemon
and
cloves
the
flavor
is
very
refreshing
oranges
apricots
and
bananas
the
lively
carbonation
bites
the
tongue
on
the
finish
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
one
was
quite
enjoyable
a
750ml
bottle
it
was
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
it
had
a
spicy
fruit
odor
with
some
malt
undertones
taste
was
wonderful
fruit
citrus
with
some
nice
spiciness
that
provided
a
lingering
warmth
a
little
bit
of
hops
very
good
mouthfeel
although
a
tiny
bit
too
carbonated
good
beer
very
drinkable
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
la
chouffe
a
great
belgianstyle
ale
for
any
occasion
very
invigorating
for
its
9
abv
be
careful
or
this
beer
might
kick
your
ass
another
quality
ale
by
unibroue
kudos
to
canada
again
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
cannot
understand
why
this
beer
gets
these
very
high
grades
smooth
and
carbonated
very
refreshing
and
has
a
lemon
zest
to
it
not
like
any
ive
had
before
this
is
a
great
belgian
pale
and
thought
nothing
would
beat
duvel
i
was
wrong
i
hope
the
end
of
the
world
is
this
good
a
good
beer
but
im
afraid
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
theres
something
about
it
more
than
just
the
color
that
reminds
me
of
a
cheaper
wheat
beer
also
it
doesnt
hide
the
booze
as
well
as
say
delirium
tremens
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
but
i
would
be
reluctant
to
pay
8
xx
for
4
definately
one
of
unibroues
finest
i
have
only
tried
two
belgian
strong
pale
ales
delirium
tremens
being
the
other
one
the
la
fin
du
monde
is
very
similar
but
slightly
better
imho
pours
a
cloudy
dull
goldstraw
color
with
a
nice
carbonated
head
that
slowly
dissipates
little
to
no
lacing
prominent
nose
of
citrus
lemony
aroma
the
taste
is
really
good
citrus
astringent
sweetness
all
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
the
taste
reminds
me
of
hefes
but
the
mouthfeel
is
richer
drinkability
is
very
good
the
alcohol
is
well
disguised
i
could
have
enjoyed
another
one
three
would
be
be
pushing
it
because
of
the
high
abv
this
beer
delerium
tremens
and
aventinus
have
sharpened
my
palate
for
astringent
beers
this
one
deserves
the
reputation
it
has
truly
a
great
beer
easily
the
most
luscious
and
inviting
head
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
it
reminds
me
of
the
frothy
top
of
a
handmade
milkshake
imparting
the
impression
that
it
was
homemade
with
lots
of
love
body
is
straw
colored
gold
with
light
carbonation
i
would
call
the
nose
lemony
but
with
the
disclaimer
that
it
is
in
no
way
sour
also
along
for
the
aroma
ride
is
a
smell
i
can
only
call
pleasantly
milky
and
a
hefty
amount
of
spice
taste
is
at
once
full

a
dash
of
sweet
milk
and
smatter
of
bitterness
says
i
to
the
mouthfeel
a
winner
is
you
as
it
is
big
and
full
the
light
carbonation
enhances
its
creaminess
the
lacing
looks
like
a
work
of
art
or
more
aptly
something
drawn
from
a

yet
another
head
turning
unibroue
beer
thank
you
beer
advocate
for
had
i
not
become
a
member
i
would
not
know
the
pleasure
of
this
fine
brewery
d
moderate
drinkability
orangey
apricot
color
appearance
fairly
murky
too
nice
3mm
head
remains
throughout
smell
is
clean
and
fruity
taste
is
deep
rich
blend
of
fruitiness
and
some
excellent
effervescence
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
an
often
overlooked
beer
it
is
tremendous
d
very
drinkable
another
excellent
brew
from
unibroue
would
highly
recommend
and
buy
again
i
remember
the
750ml
i
had
a
while
back
to
be
a
tad
better
maybe
thats
because
by
the
time
i
was
finished
with
that
i
was
not
in
the
same
state
as
i
am
now
a
great
north
americanmade
belgian
and
another
feather
in
the
cap
for
unibroue
big
generous
white
head
sits
atop
the
hazy
goldenyellow
body
a
fresh
airy
aroma
of
fruit
features
on
the
nose
delicately
spicy
malt
appears
on
the
palate
yeasty
slightly
bready
flavors
give
way
to
a
semisweet
medium
finish
the
ample
head
on
this
beer
not
to
mention
the
high
abv
belies
its
smooth
accomodating
nature
la
fin
du
monde
is
highly
satisfying
and
rewarding
this
beer
is
becoming
a
classic
in
its
own
right
mouthfeel
is
winelike
i
would
call
this
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
slightly
higher
than
expected
but
overall
it
works
well
with
this
strong
ale
superb
experience
the
beer
pours
out
a
straw
gold
and
has
a
magnificent
head
that
stays
around
for
minutes
and
leaves
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
has
a
very
clean
taste
the
beer
is
very
strong
but
the
alcohol
is
subtle
excellent
example
of
a
nonbelgian
belgian
the
flavor
is
very
authentic
and
can
stand
toe
to
toe
with
any
beligian
tripel
that
ive
tried
i
definately
recommend
it
where
is
the
alcohol
this
brew
is
damn
drinkable
for
a
9
another
in
a
long
line
of
many
winners
from
unibroue
outstanding
vision
pours
into
the
glass
thick

great

loft
and
linger
even
when
the
glass
is
away
from
your

flavors
of
cloves
citrus
yeast
and
crisp
sweetness
i
could
hardly
sense
the
9
0
alcohol
in
this
beer
outstanding
mouthfeel
is
medium
very
smooth
wellcarbonated
texture
like
a
wheat
ale
style
exists
somewhere
between
a
belgian
tripel
and
a
hefeweizen
widely
available
and
eminently
drinkable
enough
to
get
you
into
trouble
even
with
a
slow
pour
this
brew
has
a
huge
fluffy
brilliant
white
head
lots
of
yeast
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
not
much
head
retention
fades
to
a
paper
thin
white
line
color
is
light
orange
very
cloudy
and
lots
of
carbonation
decent
aromas
of
fruits
cider

apples
and
pears
very
well
rounded
taste
fruity
tart
and
sweet
all
at
once
alcohol
is
not
a
factor
awesome
mouthfeel
this
beer
dances
all
over
your
tongue
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
so
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
my
first
from
unibroue
a
great
sipper
i
will
certainly
try
more
of
their
beers
i
am
on
a
hunt
for
this
beer
in
my
hometown
not
to
be
missed
and
cheaper
than
a
true
belgian
for
everyday
drinking
very
drinkable
another
amazing
unibroue
boy
can
they
make
beer
this
is
a
quality
product
its
not
perfect
but
definitely
deserves
a
place
among
the
better
grand
cru
types
mouthfeel
pretty
light
and
no
real
warmth
gained
from
the
9
alcohol
content
but
the
hops
are
noticed
more
on
the
back
of
the
palate
with
all
the
sweeter
stuff
shocasing
in
the
front
th
ecarboantion
helps
to
enhance
the
flavors
all
around
im
not
sure
why
but
i
seem
to
think
imperial
wit
bier
fantastic
beer
for
the
value
and
great
for
a
warm
night
outside
on
the
balcony
again
absolutely
great
la
fin
du
monde
is
a
medium
yellow
with
heavy
carbonation
and
a
billowy
thick
white
head
i
smell
fruit
and
cloves
and
something
faintly
peppery
that
i
cant
quite
nail
down
any
better
than
that
it
tastes
fruity
sweet
with
the
aforementioned
peppery
dry
and
somewhat
hot
alcohol
finish
this
is
an
interesting
and
very
drinkable
potion
12oz
bottle
this
beer
come
out
of
the
bottle
quite
fizzy
leaving
quite
a
head
it
dropped
away
to
nothing
almost
immediately
the
beer
itself
is
a
cloudy
darker
golden
color
this
has
a
very
nice
aroma
the
spiciness
pepper
and
corriander
is
the
first
thing
that
you
note
followed
off
by
a
citirc
breadiness
there
is
still
a
touch
of
the
fiziness
to
the
tongue
quite
suprisingly
the
taste
is
that
of
a
good
medium
bodied
beer
but
the
carbonation
makes
it
taste
lighter
notes
of
breadiness
citrus
and
corriander
to
the
taste
a
very
nice
tripel
wow
this
stuff
is
good
ive
just
moved
to
canada
from
england
and
i
was
perusing
the
shelves
of
a
local
liquor
store
and
bemoaning
the
cost
of
import
beer
uk
and
belgium
stuff
costs
a
fortune
here
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
unibroue
terrible
and
got
into
a
conversation
with
a
lady
that
was
grabbing
armfuls
of
unibroue
stuff
anyway
to
cut
a
long
story
short
she
bought
all
the
la
fin
du
monde
they
had
but
told
me
it
was
great
i
took
my
bottles
over
to
the
counter
and
found
shed
bought
a
bottle
for
me
thanks
lady
i
just
finished
gulping
most
of
it
down
it
reminds
me
of
one
of
my
favourite
belgium
beers
delerium
tremens
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
colour
and
once
settled
is
very
quaffable
excellent
stuff
and
i
shall
be
trying
more
of
this
in
the
very
near
future
im
delighted
by
the
massive
three
finger
head
on
this
brew
retention
is
nice
and
lacing
is
also
fine
color
is
a
deep
orangetan
and
is
very
cloudy
smell
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
citrus
flavors
spice
wheat
and
slight
floral
characters
tastes
very
complex
and
strong
spicy
citrus
orange
lemon
etc
in
a
bready
malt
mix
which
is
both
sweet
and
tangy
with
a
slightly
sour
finish
in
which
the
9
alcohol
is
well
disguised
immense
carbonation
strikes
the
edeges
of
the
tongue
and
the
feel
is
rich
with
a
nice
medium
body
coats
the
palate
well
with
a
near
perfect
balance
of
flavors
it
is
a
very
drinkable
selection
and
a
must
have
to
be
kept
in
your
fridge
at
all
times
after
i
hit
bpeters2
with
the
cork
we
poured
it
poured
tan
orangy
color
with
a
huge
foamy
head
odor
was
spicey
kind
of
nutmeglike
taste
was
pretty
darn
delicious
nutmeg
cloves
spices
an
excellent
sour
quality
that
i
really
liked
smooth
delicious
this
is
great
stuff
not
too
spicy
or
harsh
like
some
other
belgian
strongs
mmm
maybe
ill
get
another
unibroue
for
next
month
ive
loved
this
beer
and
a
few
of
the
other
unibroues
for
a
long
time
but
this
is
my
first
time
reviewing
it
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
bubbles
continuously
fighting
upwards
from
the
bottom
of
my
duvel
glass
beautiful
nose
big
but
still
delicate
with
loads
of
fruits
and
cloves
and
an
underlying
nectary
sweetness
taste
is
huge
with
fruity
sweetness
clove
and
a
peppery
alcoholic
tinge
lots
of
effervescent
bubbles
on
the
tongue
and
a
nice
long
warm
finish
this
isnt
a
beer
you
can
knock
back
due
to
the
abv
but
its
so
rich
in
its
flavors
and
light
in
its
touch
that
it
doesnt
matter
you
get
a
nights
worth
of
flavors
in
one
glass
phenomenal
vive
le
quebec
d
theres
nothing
amazingly
original
about
this
beer
but
it
is
excellent
all
regards
and
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
in
the
future
hazy
yellow
with
thick
head
loads
of
retention
with
webby
lacing
sweet
fruity
nose
bananas
and
yeast
with
slight
alcohol
hints
similar
taste
with
a
light
spicy
character
to
it
smooth
crisp
taste
with
sharp
but
somewhat
sweet
alcohol
flavor
and
warming
this
is
a
great
beer
drinkability
exceptional
but
at
9
abv
the
night
wouldnt
last
very
long
ive
got
a
corked
750ml
resting
at
home
for
me
so
ill
give
it
another
go
with
that
one
in
a
couple
of
years
fin
du
monde
is
a
truly
wonderful
achievement
from
the
people
at
unibroue
im
just
glad
that
this
was
the
first
brew
that
led
to
my
appreciation
and
enjoyment
of
finer
beers
a
great
discovery
a
fine
interpretation
of
the
style
very
quaffable
but
really
sneeks
up
on
you
hard
to
believe
it
is
9
served
in
a
corked
bottle
conditioned
750ml
bottle
with
freshness
date
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
large
frothy
head
and
last
a
while
smell
has
hints
of
fruits
some
pear
scent
taste
is
well
rounded
with
tastes
of
yeast
malt
fruit
and
some
slight
acidity
tastes
great
and
has
some
warming
effect
from
the
9
abv
mouthfeel
is
good
fills
the
tongue
with
flavors
very
drinkable
this
might
sound
dumb
but
i
could
drink
this
all
day
well
at
least
until
i
passed
out
this
is
delicious
complex
crisp
delicate
and
robust
at
the
same
time
highly
recommended
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
2
14
white
head
above
the
translucent
dark
golden
brew
pillowy
head
lasts
and
lasts
a
product
of
the
active
bubbling
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
with
ample
sticky
white
lacing
aroma
is
effervescent
spicy
pale
malts
taste
is
that
belgianstyle
spicy
malt
that
we
all
know
closing
with
the
most
subtle
alcohol
warming
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
could
be
a
bit
smoother
and
drinkability
is
only
limited
by
the
fact
that
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
finally
begin
to
wear
after
awhile
a
nice
treat
after
a
snowy
day
overall
this
is
a
fine
sipping
beer
meant
to
be
savoured
over
a
span
of
an
evening
however
that
said
i
tend
to
lean
away
from
most
sipping
brews
this
is
an
excellent
beer
well
balanced
and
each
sip
leaves
you
wanting
more
a
little
strong
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
an
excellent
choice
that
i
will
buy
again
this
gets
a
bit
cloying
after
a
bit
but
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
enjoyable
but
not
for
everyday
the
taste
started
sweet
and
finished
crisp
and
clean
i
could
taste
malt
but
not
really
a
lot
of
hops
it
felt
incredibly
lively
in
the
mouth
and
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
from
beginning
to
end
easily
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
poured
a
light
foamy
and
highly
carbonated
brew
from
my
750ml
bottle
unibroue
always
gives
you
away
with
their
highly
malty
smell
taste
was
rather
sweet
with
ripe
apples
in
the
palate
incredible
smooth
going
down
fairly
light
body
i
could
drink
this
all
night
as
it
compares
to
a
fine
champagne
an
excellent
beer
to
toast
with
alcohol
is
very
warming
no
problem
puttin
this
stuff
away
i
mean
consuming
its
not
my
first
and
doubt
it
will
be
my
last
cheers
all
in
all
id
say
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
available
to
me
and
always
a
safe
bet
if
i
dont
know
which
beer
i
want
on
a
given
night
this
is
insanely
drinkable
for
9
0
abv
i
must
have
been
insane
to
only
buy
one
bottle
very
nice
this
beer
might
not
be
a
great
session
beer
the
alcohol
content
is
a
little
high
the
flavor
though
is
great
and
not
overly
aggressive
this
beer
is
definately
worth
a
few
tries
served
in
a
unibroue
snifter
glass
at
twains
in
decatur
ga
pours
a
hazy
orange
yellow
color
with
a
massive
sudsy
white
head
2
inches
impressive
lacing
that
curtains
the
entire
glass
as
i
drink
the
beer
has
a
spicy
cloves
nutmeg
and
citrus
fruit
aroma
very
nice
a
gentle
but
full
flavor
of
citrus
and
cloves
with
a
very
carbonated
mouth
feel
the
taste
includes
some
bread
and
banana
notes
as
well
this
is
a
really
good
beer
everything
i
have
had
from
unibroue
has
been
a
smash
hit
notes
please
pick
this
up
if
you
see
it
in
the
store
you
will
be
glad
you
did
despite
the
problems
its
highly
drinkable
if
this
style
of
beer
is
a
favorite
but
its
got
nothing
on
the
true
belgians
in
this
style
i
prefer
the
topnotch
maudite
or
trois
pistoles
when
it
comes
to
unibroue
overall
an
excellent
brew
but
watch
out
the
9
abv
will
get
you
quality
brew
that
is
a
staple
in
any
beer
lovers
fridge
a
fantastic
brew
this
is
a
very
intersting
and
enjoyable
brew
unibroue
has
another
winner
here
dit
will
be
a
challenge
to
wait
to
drink
the
other
3
i
love
this
beer
and
want
to
drink
all
four
right
now
d
3

this
beer
poured
a
pale
hazy
amber
color
with
a
foamy
head
about
two
fingerwidths
in
height
ther
aroma
was
light
and
slightly
fruity
the
taste
was
mildly
fruity
with
a
definite
spicyness
only
mildly
bitter
and
quite
smooth
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
drinkabity
is
extreme
considering
the
abv
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
thick
and
foamy
white
head
exhibits
nice
retention
before
slowly
giving
way
to
heavy
lacing
smells
of
malts
and
spices
citrus
yeasty
bread
slight
sting
of
alcohol
present
on
the
nose
tastes
absolutely
incredible
hits
with
citrus
and
hops
first
then
a
little
fruiter
banana
flavor
present
some
finishing
a
little
on
the
yeasty
side
with
the
malt
flavor
and
a
slight
bite
from
the
9
abv
that
is
easily
forgotten
when
drinking
this
lighter
ale
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
moderately
carbonated
drinkability
the
lowest
point
of
this
brew
and
although
suprisingly
light
and
refreshing
as
this
ale
is
still
has
far
too
complex
of
a
taste
and
too
high
of
an
abv
to
want
to
just
drink
any
more
than
two
or
three
of
these
exsquisite
brews
in
one
sitting
hats
off
to
unibroue
with
the
end
of
the
world
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
half
inch
head
the
aroma
was
fruity
and
also
had
undertones
of
breadyeast
the
taste
was
of
candi
sugar
citrus
and
sweet
malt
very
tasty
and
without
a
doubt
has
a
belgian
character
the
finish
was
spicy
and
slightly
alcoholic
with
the
sweetcandi
sugar
taste
making
itself
known
again
this
beer
is
a
treat
for
sure
but
2
bottles
is
my
limit
the
9
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
if
youre
not
careful
this
is
a
truly
exceptional
belgian
pale
ale
just
a
shade
less
good
than
the
vanguard
of
its
class
duvel
pours
a
nice
fizzy
head
with
very
tight
carbonation
taste
is
of
all
the
good
things
youd
expect
from
the
triplefermentation
process
currants
cinnamon
pepper
coriander
a
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
to
score
higher
in
mouthfeel
and
its
high
abv
takes
away
from
its
drinkability
but
there
are
few
better
sippers
in
the
world
crisp
refreshing
but
also
feels
heavy
a
decent
after
dinner
brew
to
sip
and
relax
with
light
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
white
pillow
of
a
head
loads
of
tiny
bubbles
continuously
rising
to
the
surface
lots
of
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominantly
yeasty
with
some
pepper
and
spices
and
a
little
orange
zest
biscuity
taste
with
a
nice
spicy
yeast
taste
the
champagne
like
mouthfeel
helps
make
this
a
very
refreshing
beer
cheers
whats
wrong
with
unibroue
jesus
ive
had
so
many
of
their
styles
and
they
all
have
been
awsome
this
doesnt
happen
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
nonlong
lasting
head
taste
is
a
combination
of
dried
apricot
and
yeasty
notes
with
some
alcohol
it
blends
all
perfectly
nice
mouthfeel
and
finish
im
glad
unibroue
is
widely
avaliable
in
maine
even
if
it
wasnt
i
could
make
a
road
trip
to
quebec
this
is
what
beer
should
be
m
d
very
carbonated
almost
takes
away
from
the
belgian
taste
love
that
its
a
high
abvcant
taste
the
alcohol
very
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
dry
fruity
pear
after
taste
drinkability
is
pretty
high
on
a
summer
day
of
course
whlie
basking
in
the
hot
sun
drinkability
despite
the
9
abv
the
ale
is
very
drinkable
tasting
so
smooth
and
balanced
one
does
not
even
realize
the
alcohol
until
it
is
way
too
late
an
excellent
ale
from
a
top
notch
brewery
this
is
very
smooth
for
being
a
9
percent
ale
im
reviewing
outside
my
favorite
styles
to
try
something
different
i
expected
to
be
disappointed
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
still
have
a
750ml
bottle
aging
a
classic
really
good
beer
its
drinkable
depending
on
how
you
handle
the
bubbles
i
drank
the3
of
the
4
pack
over
the
course
of
5
or
6
nights
the
most
recent
on
nye
champagne
of
beers
i
tells
ya
and
one
was
good
enough
per
time
and
even
though
the
alcohol
wasnt
as
present
as
id
figured
id
still
be
careful
because
maybe
after
2
it
could
creep
up
quickly
great
beer
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
but
i
think
it
lacks
a
little
depth
especially
in
comparison
to
the
excellent
trois
pistoles
i
had
the
other
night
the
abv
is
sneaky
here
too
a
little
too
sneaky
actually
edit
i
recently
picked
up
a
bottle
and
some
wild
barnyardlike
flavors
were
present
and
became
quite
cloying
it
may
have
just
been
a
bad
bottle
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
very
prominent
but
mellow
enough
with
a
light
enough
carbonation
to
make
this
very
enjoyable
really
good
this
is
a
good
beer
and
im
going
to
have
to
return
to
it
and
conduct
a
more
thorough
review
the
12
ounce
sample
wasnt
enough
to
get
a
feel
for
this
beer
it
seems
like
it
deserves
its
reputation
but
ill
need
to
try
some
more
to
be
sure
i
was
amazed
when
i
notice
the
other
day
that
ive
never
actually
written
a
review
of
my
favorite
beer
not
much
to
say
that
hasnt
been
said
but
ill
give
it
a
shot
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
golden
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
foaming
white
head
that
soon
dissipates
the
nose
is
classic
fruity
and
yeasty
the
taste
is
an
amazing
blend
of
citrus
malt
and
slight
sweetness
with
the
littlest
hint
of
hops
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
9
0
abv
this
is
my
goto
beer
when
im
just
looking
for
something
great
to
entertain
friends
or
kick
back
and
relax
md
lively
upfront
and
turning
softer
as
it
goes
the
alcoholic
warmth
is
pretty
restricted
and
makes
this
drink
more
devilishlydrinkable
than
the
famous
duvel
although
in
the
end
the
sticky
sweet
aftertaste
proves
a
bit
too
much
to
my
liking
that
said
this
is
the
top
dog
in
my
book
for
the
style
of
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
that
i
sometimes
overlook
i
really
shouldnt
a
year
or
more
in
the
cellar
will
probably
make
this
beer
that
much
more
extraordinary
and
i
have
a
couple
down
there
waiting
to
find
out
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
loads
of
white
foam
that
sits
statuesque
and
leaves
behind
intricate
lacing
patterns
aromas
of
candy
alcohol
oranges
and
white
grapes
seem
to
come
out
very
complex
and
enticing
the
taste
is
a
brilliant
blend
of
fruit
hop
bitterness
and
sweet
candy
the
limited
carbonation
and
sour
backbone
of
this
beer
work
very
well
together
the
texture
is
a
bit
sticky
and
mildly
astringent
the
only
flaw
i
can
really
pin
point
with
this
beer
despite
the
high
abv
and
the
assertive
flavors
in
this
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
this
poured
to
a
very
quickly
dissipating
head
leaving
a
slightly
transparent
golden
brown
brew
this
stuff
smells
absolutely
amazing
honey
and
bananas
moved
to
the
nose
quickly
by
the
very
active
carbonation
taste
is
good
very
full
bodied
the
high
abv
is
slightly
apparent
but
warming
mouthfeel
is
decent
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
this
that
makes
it
something
meant
to
be
sipped
slowly
and
carefuly
this
is
a
good
beer
especially
on
those
cold
days
where
it
feels
like
it
is
the
end
of
the
world
warms
you
right
up
notes
a
well
crafted
belgian
brew
truely
is
a
fine
example
of
north
american
breweries
being
able
to
keep
up
with
the
traditions
from
belgium
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
time
that
i
went
to
montreal
granted
i
was
a
little
under
the
weather
and
not
with
it
the
entire
time
i
had
a
great
beer
called
i
think
it
was
called
boreale
if
i
recall
correctly
these
beers
are
very
similar
and
this
unibroue
reminded
me
of
the
great
times
i
had
in
montreal
so
in
that
case
i
say
it
is
very
drinkable
this
brewery
really
captures
the
essence
of
canada
like
a
good
canadian
brewery
should
i
would
recommend
any
unibroue
to
anyone

full

juicy
the

absolutely
sublime
i
highly
recommend
this
one
my
favorite
of
all
the
unibroues
to
date
drinkability
man
i
could
drink
these
suckers
all
night
super
refeshing
and
crisp
not
overly
sweet
and
hops
wont
kill
the
palete
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
profile
but
you
can
definitely
feel
its
warmth
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
well
worth
anyones
time
to
seek
out
and
enjoy
m
light
to
medium
body
bubbly
over
the
tongue
smooth
this
is
a
great
beer
another
exceptional
beer
from
unibroue
notes
simply
beautiful
presentation
silver
foil
around
the
top
of
a
bottle
that
slopes
to
resemble
a
womans
shoulders
very
inviting
and
very
tasty
i
would
highly
recommend
this
if
you
like
sweet
beers
this
one
is
for
you
thanks
for
the
bottle
len
this
brew
is
big
on
head
as
it
pours
into
a
tulip
glass
the
yeast
clouds
the
orange
hue
and
swirls
through
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
flower
that
i
just
cant
place
the
taste
is
a
sweet
peppery
spiced
ale
the
alcohol
is
pronounced
as
is
the
yeast
and
malt
the
consistency
is
smooth
and
chewy
a
true
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
suffers
only
because
for
what
ever
reason
the
brew
dries
out
my
sinuses
everytime
i
dirnk
it
mouthfeel
carbination
is
perfect
it
is
high
dont
get
me
wrong
but
it
works
exceptionally
well
with
this
beer
its
taken
me
long
enough
to
get
around
to
this
one
and
im
glad
i
did
this
one
poured
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
and
great
carbonation
bubbles
the
head
was
very
thick
and
frothy
and
managed
to
stay
around
till
the
last
sip
the
smell
was
very
fruity
and
spicy
due
to
the
belgian
yeast
the
taste
was
outstanding
with
large
pinapple
notes
and
peppery
spice
mixed
with
a
near
perfect
carbonation
level
that
made
for
a
great
experience
if
you
are
a
fan
of
belgian
beers
this
one
is
defiantly
worth
a
try
very
nice
smooth
almost
creamy
and
very
dangerously
drinkable
enjoyable
to
drink
with
a
body
and
fizz
not
unlike
champagne
only
detractor
in
this
case
is
abv
vs
bottle
size
one
of
the
great
beers
of
the
world
even
better
than
the
duval
that
inspired
it
in
my
opinion
a
really
nice
beer
that
i
am
glad
to
have
sampled
not
one
you
want
to
pound
due
to
the
high
alcohol
but
i
could
see
how
you
could
down
2
or
3
without
realizing
it
also
one
that
you
want
to
savor
and
enjoy
slowly
for
all
the
complexity
i
would
highly
recomend
this
one
unbelievably
drinkable
this
is
one
belgium
strong
that
i
can
have
as
a
session
beer
love
it
the
taste
was
excellent
with
an
complexity
as
rich
as
ive
tasted
bananas
citrus
and
clove
were
most
present
while
sweet
candy
yeasts
hops
and
fruits
were
defintiely
there
in
spades
it
was
extremely
creamy
and
enjoyable
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
truly
an
excellent
beer
i
will
say
it
needed
a
tad
more
malt
backbone
and
fruits
in
the
quaff

which
is
pretty
nitpicking
this
is
still
a
quality
beverage
drinkability
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
the
flavors
are
very
much
balanced
i
wish
i
had
more
poured
a
gorgeous
golden
amber
color
with
massive
white
head
that
left
attractive
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
loaded
with
summer
fruit
peaches
apricots
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
noted
sweet
candylike
aroma
taste
is
spicy
with
more
summer
fruits
to
be
found
peaches
pears
abound
alcohol
provides
a
warming
note
very
carbonated
feel
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
at
the
finish
an
excellent
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
crisp
golden
with
a
monsterous
head
that
will
rise
from
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
banana
yeast
and
butter
cups
a
nice
buttered
bread
with
honey
tones
the
taste
is
a
banana
spice
with
a
nice
sweet
banana
breat
nutty
finish
a
well
rounded
explosive
beer
very
nice
a
clean
warm
finish
nice
for
this
first
cold
western
new
york
night
perhaps
not
the
end
of
the
world
here
but
were
close
by
how
convenient
i
even
have
a
la
fin
du
monde
glass
to
drink
this
beer
from
its
an
attractive
bottle
with
its
nicelooking
front
label
informative
back
label
recommend
what
glassware
to
use
and
warns
about
the
yeast
sediment
foiled
cap
and
twist
off
cap
strange
but
whatever
im
not
going
to
knock
points
of
for
something
like
that
pours
a
light
yellowishamber
with
very
small
particles
swirling
about
but
never
settling
like
the
sediment
i
avoiding
pouring
out
of
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
guess
maybe
i
jarred
the
bottle
a
bit
while
pulling
out
of
the
back
of
the
fridge
the
head
is
very
large
white
frothy
and
stubborn
diminishing
very
slowly
leaving
thick
lacing
just
as
it
sits
and
slowly
fades
away
almost
looks
like
a
meringue
sitting
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
wonderful
aromas
of
belgian
yeast
clove
and
apple
the
taste
is
marvelous
clove
pepper
and
pear
with
a
slightly
medicinal
twang
but
in
a
good
way
finishes
warm
with
lingering
esters
it
has
a
light
body
and
an
effervescent
mouthfeel
that
finishes
smooth
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
thats
quite
easydrinking
for
a
9
brew
the
higher
price
tag
is
the
only
think
keeping
from
being
a
staple
in
my
fridge
ok
so
im
gonna
change
my
rating
im
finding
everything
almost
perfect
this
time
with
the
exception
that
id
like
to
see
it
clearer
and
not
so
cloudy
unibroue
makes
fine
products
and
this
is
not
exception
as
i
mentioned
above
i
have
this
somewhat
regularly
and
i
anticipate
many
happy
returns
yet
another
tasty
unibroue
product
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
generous
white
head
aroma
is
yeasty
sweet
malts
some
spicy
cloves
and
banana
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
spicy
hop
finish
only
traces
or
hints
of
alcohol
i
do
not
know
how
they
do
it
but
this
is
a
beer
that
truly
hides
its
gravity
cloudy
fuzzy
peach
yellow
with
a
large
bigbubbled
head
smell
is
spicy
touch
of
ginger
citrus
rind
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
dry
oh
so
arid
with
rind
and
zest
kicking
in
the
finish
is
long
and
hits
like
allspice
coriander
and
some
essence
of
clove
mouthfeel
is
full
on
the
top
of
the
palate
but
dry
underneath
very
complex
and
satisfying
dangerously
drinkable
at
9
abv
this
is
a
choice
replacement
for
an
aperitif
cocktail
or
a
dry
wine
next
cocktail
party
offer
up
a
taste
of
this
to
your
guests
theyll
thank
you
ill
have
to
find
someone
to
give
the
rest
of
this
4pack
to
anyway
my
theory
is
unibroue
released
its
one
or
two
lousy
beers
solely
to
make
its
mostly
awesome
beers
taste
better
smart
eh
this
is
very
very
drinkabledangerously
so
with
its
9
abv
theres
a
pleasing
sharpness
to
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
that
comes
out
better
at
a
temp
a
bit
lower
than
what
might
be
recommended
when
you
try
it
pour
at
fridge
temp
or
just
above
and
let
it
warm
and
i
think
youll
enjoy
it
immensely
this
is
really
nice
in
what
it
is
trying
to
accomplish
its
up
there
with
duvel
etc
and
is
certainly
less
sweet
than
some
of
the
belgians
if
beginners
into
craft
beer
could
get
by
the
high
alcohol
this
certainly
is
a
beverage
that
could
tease
and
convert
the
casual
drinker
to
explore
craft
and
belgian
beer
this
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
savored
750
ml
corked
bottle
after
the
cork
exploded
off
the
bottle
this
beer
poured
out
a
hazy
orange
with
a
big
white
head
aroma
is
yeast
spice
and
fruit
tropical
fruit
flavor
especially
apricots
pineapple
and
mango
spicy
with
pepper
and
cloves
but
not
as
spicy
as
most
of
their
dark
beers
no
hop
flavor
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
this
tastes
very
much
like
a
belgian
beer
full
mouthfeel
absolutely
no
sign
of
the
9
abv
a
truly
world
class
beer
this
is
just
one
exceptional
brew
the
effervescense
cleans
your
palate
for
the
flavors
that
are
immediately
following
i
will
keep
this
as
a
regular
in
my
selection
and
will
also
cellar
a
few
notes
certainly
a
very
unique
style
that
i
have
ever
had
very
drinkable
with
a
its
complex
flavors
cheers
i
have
been
walking
past
unibroue
bottles
for
a
while
now
theres
just
so
much
out
there
i
never
made
it
to
these
guys
ill
probably
get
further
into
their
line
this
winter
a
great
beer
i
thought
this
was
a
triple
and
it
pretty
much
is
but
apparantly
its
a
strong
belgian
pale
i
could
see
that
too
i
guess
pours
a
cloudy
yellowy
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
which
lasts
til
the
end
nice
very
yeasty
estery
and
fruity
with
plenty
of
belgian
spices
of
course
vanilla
clove
corriander
you
name
it
nice
bite
to
it
too
not
quite
as
delicate
as
most
triples
id
say
a
bit
bubbly
on
the
palate
all
in
all
an
excellent
beer
with
a
nice
little
story
behind
it
too
this
beer
requires
a
second
for
reflection
i
ordered
only
one
in
a
mix
case
of
14
different
kinds
but
next
time
i
will
order
several
this
beer
kicks
ass
d
wish
i
had
another
750ml
of
this
right
now
though
i
likely
wouldnt
be
in
a
condition
conducive
to
writing
this
review
if
i
had
it
this
beer
is
eminently
drinkable
but
take
your
time
with
it
let
the
complexity
of
this
north
of
the
border
tripel
come
through
as
you
nurse
the
offering
its
worth
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
if
you
read
this
and
think
that
there
is
another
belgian
strong
pale
ale
that
is
better
please
beermail
me
end
of
the
world
or
not
this
beer
is
the
best
in
the
universe
it
pours
a
perfect
golden
sunset
with
about
a
oneinch
cloud
atop
the
smell
is
full
of
various
fruits

a
nearly

so

so

also
so
drinkable
its
smooth

even
at
9
abv
youd
have
to
struggle
to
detect
it
and
fun
to
sip
ill
definitely
be
stocking
up
on
this
one
one
of
my
favourite
beers
of
all
time
pours
a
very
cloudy
orange
huge

the

is
honey
sweetness
orange

some

and
lots
of
bready
yeast
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
with
a
refreshing
and
dry
finish
drinkability
probably
the
best
strong
bpa
i
have
had
extremely
tasty
and
drinkable
im
afreaid
that
perhaps
the
complexity
of
this
brew
was
lost
on
my
tongue
it
is
very
good
but
it
seemed
very
normal
belfian
style
sweeteness
with
some
sweet
graininess
again
it
was
good
but
nothng
out
of
the
ordinary
here
refreshingly
active
carbonation
with
moderately
ligh
body
12
as
much
as
other
belgians
thats
enough
for
my
endorsement
from
a
750ml
cageandcork
bottle
pale
yelloworange
in
color
hazy
with
a
fine
creamy
white
head
beautiful
smells
of
grain
yeast
lemon
and
orange
zest
lightly
spicy
coriander
on
the
palate
there
is
an
alcoholic
warming
sensation
sweet
malt
and
grain
spicy
again
smooth
and
yet
spritzy
in
the
mouth
fullbodied
and
oh
so
drinkable
with
a
dry
finish
appetizing
ooooh
this
is
good
poured
out
to
a
cloudy
off
gold
color
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
and
rings
of
lace
surrounding
the
interior
of
the
glass
higher
level
of
carbonation
nice
aromas
of
citrus
and
floral
notes
fill
the
nose
some
hints
of
malt
and
yeast
are
present
very
nice
taste
is
not
as
present
as
the
aroma
but
still
very
quaffable
flavors
of
malt
spice
clove
and
yeast
blend
together
in
very
heavenly
harmony
complexity
is
abound
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
savory
not
too
heavy
as
to
hinder
the
experience
of
this
beer
yet
not
too
light
as
to
make
it
airey
a
solid
level
of
drinkability
a
4pack
of
this
would
have
a
shorter
life
in
my
fridge
than
a
snowball
in
hell
highly
recommended
the
beer
pours
hazy
lazy
yelloworange
with
a
fluffly
head
the
nose
is
pure
yeast
and
fruit
almost
saisonlike
in
temperment
the
taste
is
big
and
restrained
citrus
notes
to
the
back
and
hops
mixed
with
yeast
to
the
front
what
makes
this
beer
a
fave
of
mine
is
the
balance
and
drinkability
a
truly
great
beer
very
good
but
not
as
refined
as
might
be
wished
good
with
food
refreshing
mouthfeel
carbonation
makes
for
a
light
beverage
and
nice
mouthfell
three
or
four
of
these
and
im
gone
a
refreshing
and
pleasant
winter
warmer
drinkability
nice
beer
good
drinkability
no
more
than
one
750
every
once
in
a
while
watch
out
for
that
abv
unibroue
is
top
notch
drinkability

superb
drinkability
for
any
style
deceptively
drinkable
for
a
9
abv
beer
in
the
mean
time
i
will
definitely
still
buy
and
enjoy
this
while
im
waiting
on
bottles
to
age
just
a
tad
too
much
carbonation
which
detracts
from
the
moutfeel
but
not
too
bad
overall
its
a
good
beer
ill
have
to
come
back
to
this
one
again
the
time
between
sips
keeps
decreasing
i
am
growing
impatient
as
my
body
and
mind
crave
for
this
beers
wonderful
flavor
is
it
possible
that
the
name
refers
to
how
you
feel
when
you
realize
that
you
just
finished
your
last
bottle
i
wouldnt
mind
if
this
was
my
last
beer
at
the
end
of
the
world
750
ml
corked
and
bailed
bottle
notes
one
of
my
favorites
for
a
long
time
i
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
those
unibroue
characters
really
know
what
theyre
doing
overall
im
not
a
belgian
connoisseur
first
and
foremost
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
quite
cleansing
smooth
overall
this
beer
is
still
quite
impressive
though
it
was
slightly
less
so
than
when
i
had
it
previously
i
found
the
alcohol
presence
quite
strong
and
this
made
it
less
drinkable
of
course
still
a
beer
that
i
will
have
again
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
first
good
beers
i
tried
and
definitely
as
good
as
anything
you
can
get
in
belgian
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
hue
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
retains
well
aroma

impressive
and
shocking

bready

mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
and
slight
alcohol
notes
extremely
impressive
and
delicious
alcohol
is
barley
noticeable
definately
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
golden
in
color
somewhat
unfiltered
looking
no
lacing
to
speak
of
chunky
cloud
like
head
that
was
mountainous
high
alcohol
content
is
evident
had
a
bit
of
spicy
but
fairly
mild
in
that
department
complex
ale
but
fairly
mellow
in
the
body
hops
were
subdued
malt
character
was
mostly
fruity
and
balanced
the
hops
but
hops
were
the
man
of
the
house
tempered
by
the
warming
for
sure
i
liked
this
brew
and
would
reccomend
this
as
nightcapper
material
or
pre
nightcapper
if
your
a
veteran
recommended
to
fans
of
good
beer
this
is
the
one
that
quebec
should
be
proud
of
its
the
end
of
the
world
as
we
know
it
et
je
me
sens
très
bien
very
good
beer
none
the
less
i
definitely
reccommend
it
25
oz
bottle
shared
at
zenos
pour
into
a
tulip
a
nice
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
very
thick
and
persistant
white
head
smell
is
light
sweet
fruity
and
yeasty
taste
starts
with
sweet
malt
which
turns
into
a
very
nice
fruit
flavor
which
is
difficult
to
place
perhaps
very
sweet
oranges
there
is
also
some
good
spicy
hop
flavor
to
balance
it
out
in
the
finish
very
balanced
and
tastey
brew
this
has
a
very
nice
medium
full
mouthfeel
with
some
significant
carbonation
that
suits
this
beer
very
well
this
is
9
abv
but
its
hard
to
tell
from
the
taste
very
well
hidden
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
in
fact
present
however
this
stuff
hits
hard
dangerous
and
wonderful
end
of
the
world
indeed
d
not
very
good
i
think
ill
steer
clear
of
la
fin
du
monde
in
the
future
it
wasnt
a
terrible
beer
but
for
the
price
and
the
brewery
i
expected
more
its
strong
point
is
that
the
9
abv
is
obfuscated
probably
under
the
powerful
carbonation
i
do
however
have
a
serious
question
are
you
supposed
to
drink
the
sediment
at
the
bottom
i
did
and
found
it
raunchy
i
would
appreciate
an
answer
because
i
plan
to
try
it
again
overall
where
is
that
9
hiding
at
besides
the
very
faint
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
its
very
similar
to
a
beefed
up
hefe
very
smooth
with
a
hint
of
hops
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
egg
shell
colored
head
that
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
both
the
aroma
and
taste
was
full
of
sweet
citrus
light
sourness
yeast
and
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
moderately
carbonated
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
styled
beer
but
its
retty
decent
d
wow
for
having
9
abv
this
was
a
very
gentle
smooth
beer
that
had
lots
of
good
qualities
and
a
nice
finish
overall
though
a
tasty
unique
belgianinspired
brew
that
i
will
most
likely
try
again
when
im
picking
up
an
assortment
of
singles
but
other
than
that
its
disguised
very
well
not
bad
not
as
good
as
i
expected
paid
8
for
this
bottle
but
would
probably
only
pay
about
5
or
so
overpriced
for
the
quality
in
my
opinion
overall
quite
nice
i
had
been
slowly
trying
the
unibroue
line
when
i
couldnt
find
other
weirder
brews
but
i
might
run
through
all
of
them
now
extremely
drinkable
especially
since
its
9
abv
very
nice
and
clean
and
a
great
summer
refresher
brown
with
gold
hints
and
a
pleasing
aroma
of
yeast
and
citrus
fruit
it
strikes
a
great
balance
between
fruit
and
yeast
flavors
too
along
with
some
sweet
floral
notes
quite
carbonated
with
no
overpowering
alcohol
flavors
refreshing
enough
to
be
consumed
in
hot
weather
yet
warming
enough
to
be
consumed
in
the
winer
well
done
its
the
end
of
the
review
and
i
am
feeling
fine
even
though
belgiuns
arent
my
favorite
this
beer
was
pretty
good
12
oz
bottle
approximately
a
year
old

served
slightly
chilled
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
golden
orangeyellow
that
is
slightly
cloudy
and
has
a
1
inch
white
head
that
sticks
nicely
smells
like
orange
juice
lemons
spiciness
pepper
yeast
and
cloves
the
orange
juice
aroma
is
slightly
offputting
the
taste
is
virtually
the
same
but
with
coriander
and
a
mild
bitterness
it
is
very
malty
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
a
thick
body
with
medium
carbonation
its
good
but
i
remember
it
being
even
better
than
this
drinkability
the
end
of
the
world
packs
a
serious
punch
of
flavors
aroma
and
brain
kick
remarkably
good
but
you
may
end
up
at
la
fin
du
monde
if
you
go
to
nuts
with
this
one
this
is
such
and
awesome
beer
la
fin
du
monde
is
a
wonderful
effort
and
is
an
admirable
example
of
its
style
however
it
lacks
a
certain
je
ne
sais
quoi
and
therefore
doesnt
quite
equal
the
best
bspas
that
said
im
savoring
the
final
few
ounces
and
im
definitely
feeling
fine
hazy
straw
white
fizzy
head
with
decent
staytime
complex
aroma
of
peppery
spiciness
peachmango
and
banana
fruitiness
flower
petals
and
sweet
grains
flavor
starts
very
sweet
and
orangy
with
aforementioned
pepper
and
high
carbonation
spritz
ends
in
a
nice
balance
as
the
acidity
and
sweetness
fade
away
phenolics
seem
a
bit
minerally
in
a
pleasant
way
alcohol
is
rather
hidden
in
the
flavor
but
not
the
effect
pleasant
fuzziness
sets
in
quickly
with
this
brew
very
wellrounded
but
strong
flavors
and
solid
spiciness
wellmade
and
complex
pours
a
solid
cloud
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
enormous
bright
white
and
fluffy
and
lasts
for
the
whole
glass
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
fruits
with
floral
and
herbal
notes
this
beer
smells
fantastic
the
taste
is
citrusy
and
tangy
with
some
alcohol
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
and
very
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
something
big
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
poured
a
deep
gold
color
mildly
hazy
with
a
thick
eggwhite
colored
head
the
head
continues
to
refresh
itself
via
a
thin
stream
of
champagne
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
mild
breaddough
aroma
up
front
followed
by
citrusorange
and
grapefruit
rind
some
coriander
spice
finished
by
a
mild
caramel
malt
the
taste
has
more
of
the
citrus
up
front
backed
by
the
spice
finished
nicely
by
the
malt
in
the
form
of
toffee
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
carbonation
a
light
and
bright
mouth
feel
and
a
high
drinakbility
a
great
na
belgian
style
ale
i
drank
the
beer
with
the
current
brewer
at
shed
brewery
and
surprisingly
it
wasnt
putrid
the
alcohol
had
continued
to
develop
for
at
least
3
of
those
years
because
it
nearly
burned
our
eyes
but
the
yeast
characteristics
and
maltiness
maintained
i
wouldnt
recommend
aging
to
the
length
that
i
performed
but
la
fin
du
monde
has
a
life
of
its
own
a
fighting
will
to
survive
and
to
be
the
better
beer
enjoy
and
appreciate
served
in
its
glass
a
pale
hazy
yellow
with
2
fingers
of
frothy
white
head
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
spicy
apple
skins
tangerine
bubblegum
bananas
grass
wonderfully
complex
taste
is
like
smooth
rich
banana
pudding
with
some
oranges
apples
spices
and
cloves
all
thrown
in
the
mix
superb
velvety
mouthfeel
throughout
and
alcohol
that
is
absolutely
hidden
from
sight
this
is
a
dangerously
tempting
beer
one
of
the
best
belgians
i
have
ever
tasted
from
right
here
in
north
america
drinkability
very
tasty
it
meets
my
expectations
from
this
beer
but
doesnt
really
exceed
them
very
much
but
that
wont
keep
this
beer
from
me
cheers
though
this
is
a
nice
tripel
ale
i
dont
give
it
the
praise
that
others
share
it
doesnt
have
the
maltydry
crackerlike
character
and
well
attenuated
sweetness
of
chimay
cinq
cents
white
label
nor
with
its
floral
spicy
earthy
hop
presence
this
beer
just
tastes
muted
sweet
and
over
fruity
in
comparison
the
taste
is
quite
exceptional
though
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
guess
that
it
has
a
lot
to
do
with
water
quality
there
is
no
metallic
taste
to
the
foam
which
is
actually
almost
more
tasty
than
the
beer
itself
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
banana
ester
to
the
taste
along
with
a
bit
of
clove
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
not
too
dry
and
not
too
alcoholic
for
such
a
high
abv
brew
very
creamy
and
highly
drinkable
for
such
a
heavy
beer
highly
recommended
very
drinkable
although
i
have
no
idea
why
i
didnt
get
a
nice
frothy
head
alcohol
will
get
even
more
dominate
when
it
warms
tastemouthfeel
tastes
just
like
it
smells
yeasty
and
herbal
really
wonderful
flavors
here
orange
and
spicy
hops
just
wonderful
great
mouthfeel
too
a
lot
of
belgian
pale
ales
seem
too
dry
too
me
this
one
is
perfect
a
little
dry
yes
but
doesnt
leave
you
feeling
thirsty
superb
great
mouthfeel
sticks
around
for
a
bit
after
you
swallow
but
no
bad
aftertaste
or
anything
of
that
ilk
i
could
and
have
drank
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
on
occasion
you
know
it
has
more
alcohol
than
your
average
beer
but
its
sneakily
hidden
a
lovely
beer
on
the
whole
definitely
worth
checking
out
as
are
most
unibroue
beers
superb
absolute
nectar
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
beer
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
flavor
components
ride
the
tongue
long
after
swallowing
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorite
brews
the
hazy
straw
color
with
frothy
head
that
slowly
disperses
is
quiet
nice
the
aroma
is
soothing
and
full
of
complex
notes
that
sometimes
remind
me
of
lemon
yeast
and
other
highly
aromatic
herbs

lean
towards

it
is
most
deffinately
an
ale
that
lingers
in
your
mouth
while
it
dances
about
your
palate
with
is
spiciness
a
true
treasure
in
a
bottle
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
witbier
strong
zesty
lemon
some
fresh
floral
notes
and
possibly
some
coriander
big
foamy
pale
cream
colored

leaves
strings
of

as
it
pops
its
way
to
a
dense
foamy
coating
mildly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
orangey
coriander
up
front
its
citrusy
throughout
and
only
slightly
bitter
towards
the
end
theres
a
yeasty
vanilla
flavor
that
fades
in
as
the
beer
warms
and
some
other
spices
i
cant
point
my
finger
on
body
is
moderately
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
imperial
trappist
witbier
who
cares
what
it
is
its
frickin
great
decanted
into
a
tulip
this
ale
appears
cloudy
and
orangestraw
colored
sticky
white
head
sits
atop
yeasty
bready
aromas
come
to
the
fore
followed
slight
fruit
and
some
spices
lots
of
malt
is
apparent
in
the
flavor
but
the
otherwise
big
mouthfeel
is
sharpened
by
crisp
carbonation
biscuity
and
bready
the
large
malt
bill
leads
you
into
spicy
hops
with
herbal
notes
finish
is
a
little
acidic
and
dry
but
you
are
left
with
creamy
malts
and
bananas
lingering
about
your
mouth
as
far
as
i
know
unibroue
can
do
no
wrong
cheers

up

poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
light
peachish
yellow
color
nicely
fizzy
head
that
allows
the
beautiful
aroma
of
this
beer
to
escape
smells
of
yeasties
bananas
cloves
basically
like
a
belgian
hefeweizen
flavors
on
this
one
are
spicey
and
phenolic
once
again
like
a
belgian
hefeweizen
but
not
like
a
witbier
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
ale
one
of
my
favorites
holy
balls
is
this
drinkable
what
does
9
abv
mean
again
yeah
just
awesome
cheers
on
canada
woww
what
a
beer
great
and
everlasting
head
that
gets
bigger
bubbels
but
was
there
the
whole
time
i
had
this
wonderfull
orangegolden
brew
in
my
glas
nose
is
very
fruity
hops
yeastfruit
an
probably
litle
koreander
are
present
munich
and
other
malts
as
well
as
is
yeastspice
and
alcohol
taste
is
great
also
being
strong
but
easy
drinkable
cause
of
perfect
balance
of
taste
malty
fresh
alcoholic
spicy
pepper
and
good
fitting
bitterness
make
this
into
a
great
brew
good
carbonisation
makes
mouthfeel
also
perfect
drinkability
is
great
but
maybe
too
easy
for
a
brew
of
this
strength
smell
on
this
is
very
fruity
i
picked
up
lots
of
citrus
that
smells
of
oranges
mostly
i
think
that
it
also
smells
a
little
like
apples
tastes
is
very
smooth
and
mildly
fruity
a
nice
cool
crisp
feel
on
the
tongue
very
well
balanced
very
drinkable
i
will
buy
again
a
very
good
choice
to
share
with
friends
very
good
belgium
style
beer
off
white
head
with
good
lacing
smell
is
clovey
and
that
same
clove
smell
is
found
in
the
glass
along
with
an
orangey
taste
color
reminds
me
of
a
light
orange
mouthfeel
if
spicy
and
effervescent
id
drink
this
occasionally
but
i
dont
think
id
could
have
more
than
one
a
month
too
many
other
beers
out
there
taste
delicious
smooth
and
sweet
on
the
front
end
quickly
morphing
into
a
spicy
pepper
character
towards
the
end
this
is
one
to
sip
on
and
savor
strikes
a
perfect
balance
between
the
alcohol
content
and
drinkability
factor
the
carbonation
seems
to
sneak
in
the
warming
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
like
i
said
this
brew
is
sneaky
so
watch
it
with
all
that
said
this
is
definitely
a
brew
to
end
the
night
with
well
worth
a
try
cheers
well
balanced
tart
and
sweet
hints
of
spices
and
faint
citrus
mild
hops
at
the
end
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
chewiness
at
the
end
from
the
hops
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
a
great
beer
and
dangerously
drinkable
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
body
with
a
large
white
fluffy
head
gorgeous

clinging
to
the
glass
spicy
aroma
full
of
fruity
notes

phenols
taste
was
tremendously
complex
spicy
peppery
full
of
sweetness
and
fruit
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
slight
bitterness
slick
mouthfeel
some
peach
and
pears
wonderful
beer
drinkability
and
overall
even
with
a
year
on
it
the
alcohol
presence
is
a
bit
too
strong
i
was
hoping
it
would
have
mellowed
some
more
but
still
go
unibroue
i
forgot
what
a
good
beer
this
one
was
this
a
a
beer
to
share
and
experience
with
others
others
who
appreciate
great
beer
that
is
this
is
deceptive
light
and
easy
to
drink
belying
its
strength
compares
favorably
to
top
runners
of
the
style
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
i
love
the
name
of
this
beer
its
about
the
only
french
i
know
but
it
sure
is
fun
to
say

not

a
wonderful
brew
very
drinkable
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
drinkability
hard
to
say
sure
its
a
nice
light
brew
and
i
can
see
pairing
it
with
seafood
or
vegetarian
dishes
or
enjoying
a
quiet
spring
evening
with
a
glass
but
at
7
a
bottle
im
more
inclined
to
pick
up
a
chimay
or
hennepin
certainly
worth
a
look
particularly
if
you
go
for
ales
with
a
lighter
profile
than
stouts
or
even
ambers
this
is
an
excellent
beer
from
our
kanuk
friends
to
the
north
sweet
complex
perfect
for
summer
sipping
or
as
a
fireside
warmer
definately
one
of
my
new
favorites
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
hazy
light
color
many
cascading
bubbles
thick
head
which
settles
into
a
nice
lace
sweat
malt
aroma
with
citrus
undertones
alcohol
scent
is
hiding
in
the
background
extremely
light
tasting
with
a
melting
warmness
from
the
alcohol
which
covers
the
tongue
the
alcohol
flavor
is
hidden
behind
a
blend
of
light
malt
and
citrus
nothing
is
overpowering
here
everything
is
subtle
you
might
think
you
are
drinking
a
small
summer
beer
as
the
9
of
this
one
is
so
well
masked
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
had
the
opportunity
to
have
more
than
a
couple
i
loved
this
beer
although
well
put
together
this
beer
tends
to
become
cloying
towards
the
end
of
a
bomber
ultimately
reflected
in
drinkability
problems
still
worth
a
try
a
revelation
for
my
taste
buds
unbelievable
but
this
is
fancy
beer
drink
better
drink
less
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
and
crisp
these
guys
seem
to
be
able
to
brew
these
styles
with
the
perfect
amount
of
spice
character
that
doesnt
leave
you
feeling
like
you
just
drank
a
glass
of
potpourri
very
tastefully
done
and
delicious
apple
flavors
and
a
pinch
of
hoppy
dryness
add
complexity
to
the
spice
backbone
good
bite
and
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
clovey
finish
left
over
very
highly
drinkable
with
a
very
pleasant
flavor
another
solid
brew
from
the
nordiques
this
is
a
delicious
beer
very
similar
to
duvel
in
all
aspects
though
i
think
duvel
is
slightly
better
comments
pretty
to
look
at
tastes
great
likely
to
help
you
pick
up
chicks
what
more
could
you
possibly
want
seriously
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
should
be
on
every
beer
lovers
musthave
list
made
a
nice
complement
to
a
steak
that
i
cooked
for
dinner
but
something
darker
would
probably
complement
it
better
unibroue
does
fine
work
and
this
is
yet
another
example
of
such
drinkability
ill
definitely
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
i
could
see
it
becoming
a
staple
for
me
at
least
every
once
in
a
while
its
delicious
and
its
a
sipper
i
can
hardly
believe
this
is

abv
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of

into
a
goblet
glass
presented
itself
with
an
opaque
golden
color
with
a
rich
head
which
devolved
into
persistent
lacing
smelt
fresh
and
springlike
with
an
effervescent
scent
initially
tasted
of
apples
with
a
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
as
it
warmed
i
detected
an
increasingly
pleasant
taste
that
reminded
me
of
cola
with
a
hint
of
sweet
citrus
excellent
balance
of
carbonation
and
smoothness
easy
to
sip
and
equally
easy
to
return
to
the
cooler
for
another
750ml
bottle
fine
example
of
this
style
kudos
to
unibroue
for
another
outstanding
product
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
is
highly
recommended
certainly
it
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
my
home
country
pours
like
a
wit
with
a
healthy
white
head
and
a
cloudy
golden
body
the
aroma
hints
at
yeast
and
lemon
zest
this
is
the
most
refreshing

out
there

i
somewhat
dont
believe
this
beer
is

it
just
seems
to
disappear
from
the
glass
this
is
my
favorite
widely
available
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
its
easy
to
find
so
go
out
and
have
some
this
creamy
opaque
golden
delight
mounted
a
rich
white
two
finger
head
that
slipped
down
to
a
milkylike
cover
that
made
for
a
sticky
lace
throughout
the
length
of
the
beverage
there
was
a
continuous
feed
of
bubbles
delivered
in
fizzures
of
fine
streams
reaching
upward
ripe
apricotpeach
soft
citrus
yeast
and
a
subtle
clove
and
etoh
made
for
a
delightful
nose
at
times
there
was
a
lurking
metal
essence
noted
a
medium
dimension
filled
the
mouth
with
again
the
fruit
of
the
nose
a
hay
tang
with
light
floral
and
gentle
spice
this
stuff
warms
the
belly
this
la
fin
du
monde
12
oz
bottle
was
with
much
carbonation
for
me
it
was
too
sparkling
for
balance
the
finish
was
sweet
with
a
dry
peppery
bubbly
presence
unfortunately
a
mucky
aftertaste
was
left
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
i
can
appreciate
the
grand
reviews
this
brew
receives
but
for
me
for
this
bottle
it
was
not
there
the
hidden
alcohol
gives
this
one
extra
points
for
drinkability
drinkability
an
easy
to
drink
beer
until
the
high
abv
catches
up
to
you
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
to
just
about
anyone
even
nonbeer
drinkers
could
appreciate
it
tasted
030905
truly
an
exceptional
beer
this
fine
beer
leaves
a
wonderous
full
weight
on
the
tongue
while
remaining
light
in
comparison
to
the
darker
belgium
styles
i
say
drink
this
as
much
as
your
beer
exploration
will
allow
and
dont
settle
for
only
a
12
ounce
when
there
is
a
750ml
available
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
only
leaves
me
wondering
why
i
havent
had
this
beer
before
highly
recommended
gold
in
color
with
lots
of
beautiful
cascading
and
a
huge
foamy
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
lots
of
sediment
floating
in
it
as
well
great
looking
aroma
is
mostly
citrus
and
sweet
smelling
hops
i
also
catch
some
hints
of
something
reminding
me
of
honeysuckle
a
little
also
the
yeast
is
apparent
as
well
unless
im
stupid
this
could
be
a
little
honey
or
presence
of
the
alcohol
sugars
i
imagine
nutmeg
and
spice
up
front
with
hints
of
sugar
and
citrus
fruit
however
the
alcohol
kicks
you
in
the
palete
real
real
hard
also
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
papaya
fruit
a
little
or
a
little
like
orange
peel
kind
of
bitter
yet
sweet
carbonation
is
well
balanced
and
is
not
too
strong
on
the
sip
to
which
the
alcohol
burn
hits
your
palete
drying
it
out
a
bit
before
the
swallow
i
honestly
wish
i
had
a
bomber
of
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
tasty
another
unibroue
masterpiece
very
belgian
in
both
taste
and
smell
it
has
many
elements
of
a
solid
belgian
blonde
but
its
stronger
rounder
and
creamier
top
notch
cloudy
yellow
ale
with
a
little
yeast
floating
around
thin
white
head
no
lacing
sweet
aroma
with
a
balanced
taste
of
sweet
malt
and
a
little
tartness
in
the
finish
the
aroma
is
faint
and
the
taste
is
similar
not
overpowering
but
a
very
nice
ale
the
unibroues
are
really
impressing
me
a
fine
belgian
strong
pale
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
if
not
for
the
high
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
this
is
a
darn
good
beer
while
i
would
normally
drink
something
maltier
and
darker
on
such
a
bitterly
cold
night
the
higher
abv
while
not
noticible
of
this
one
warmed
me
up
fine
a
very
tasty
brew
indeed
one
that
i
wil
definitely
be
having
again
i
cant
believe
its
not
belgian
that
was
my
first
thought
upon
tasting
this
gem
from
quebec
for
the
first
time
wow
what
a
beer
beautiful
pouring
brew
with
rich
golden
translucent
color
and
massive
thick
duvelstyle
head
smell
also
firstrate
various
spices
and
fruits
accompany
a
malty
base
taste
is
just
about
perfect
i
dont
feel
that
ive
tried
enough
beers
yet
to
be
able
to
give
one
a
5
but
this
is
the
closest
ive
come
lots
of
banana
flavor
almost
sweet
but
not
sickly
sweet
i
dont
generally
care
much
for
sweet
beer
but
this
one
just
works
somehow
very
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
an
absolutely
outstanding
beer
compared
to
a
couple
of
the
real
belgians
i
have
tried
i
would
rank
it
slightly
higher
than
la
chouffe
and
slightly
below
duvel
i
could
drink
this
for
eternity
truly
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
is
first
off
great
to
look
at
the
color
is
a
light
golden
honey
color
with
a
slight
bit
of
cloud
in
the
body
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
comes
up
the
middle
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
the
head
is
thick
white
and
foamy
the
smell
is
crisp
and
spicy
with
plenty
of
the
typical
wheats
that
you
would
expect
from
a
belgian
various
spices
and
fruity
aromas
as
well
as
some
nice
grassy
flavors
are
all
underpinned
by
a
subtle
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
great
on
this
beer
it
is
my
first
belgian
of
any
sorts
in
quite
a
while
and
after
drinking
it
i
remember
why
i
like
them
so
much
the
body
is
full
and
thick
with
wheat
flavors
and
some
spices
very
reminiscent
of
the
hennepin
as
im
sure
theyre
brewed
using
essentially
the
same
process
its
all
very
mellow
but
the
more
subtle
tastes
come
through
after
sitting
on
the
tongue
for
just
a
second
or
two
with
flavors
of
cherry
and
grape
but
nothing
to
overpower
the
wheat
theres
really
not
very
much
hop
flavor
to
this
beer
but
that
would
probably
ruin
the
delicate
flavors
dry
and
heavy
yet
tiny
carbonation
very
drinkable
belies
the
high
alcohol
content
notes
dear
god
this
is
good
it
looks
as
good
as
any
trappist
and
tastes
as
good
too
damn
i
love
this
beer
especially
when
it
warms
oh
thank
god
for
unibroue
pours
a
deep
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
bubbly
white
head
aroma
was
pears
cloves
a
citrus
fruits
with
some
caramelly
alcohol
sneaking
in
as
it
warmed
smells
very
very
good
taste
was
a
spicy
fruitiness
up
front
with
some
sugary
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
a
warming
malty
finish
with
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
you
dont
notice
the
high
abv
at
all
this
is
considerably
better
than
i
remembered
it
and
i
used
to
really
enjoy
it
now
i
have
found
my
new
years
drink
ive
had
few
brews
of
this
genre
but
i
will
most
definitely
have
more
after
this
or
perhaps
just
more

lfdm
cheers
unibroue
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
huge
thick
white
head
that
settles
down
quickly
into
a
manageable
size
this
beer
is
highly
carbonated
like
champagne
and
leaves
belgian
lace
on
the
side
of
my
glass
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
plenty
of
fruitty
esters
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
is
fruitty
and
spicy
clove
with
a
hint
of
banana
malt
flavor
is
there
in
the
taste
and
also
a
bit
of
hops
to
balance
the
bitterness
i
wonder
if
this
beer
is
spiced
or
if
it
is
all
from
the
yeast
nice
mouthfeel
but
a
little
to
carbonated
for
my
liking
however
once
the
beer
breathes
for
awhile
it
dies
down
to
a
reasonable
level
good
drinkability
for
the
style
and
the
abv
but
definately
not
a
session
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
one
definitly
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
spicy
and
fruity
to
drink
slightly
heavy
or
syrupy
but
not
distracting
sweet
overall
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overbearing
a
fantastic
belgian
strong
pale
ale
the
first
example
i
had
was
in
a
750
ml
bottle
which
was
only
decent
and
perhaps
not
wellhandled
the
current
12
oz
bottles
are
exceptionally
fresh
and
incomparable
beers
whoa
maybe
ive
lived
in
north
carolina
too
long
but
i
might
not
ready
for
a
9
abv
brew
received
this
today
in
a
beer
of
the
month
club
and
cracked
this
one
first
after
checking
out
all
these
reviews
i
have
no
comparisons
in
this
style
or
alcohol
content
yet
but
im
in
for
a
treat
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
very
nice
carbonation
floral
aroma
and
a
real
spicy
kick
to
the
taste
however
can
taste
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
fantastic
one
bottle
went
to
the
head
impressive
this
is
a
different
league
for
me
and
i
may
be
ready
to
step
up
to
the
plate
after
one
year
head
retains
a
little
less
after
a
bit
of
time
but
the
lacing
stays
aroma
hasnt
changed
much
still
very
spicy
fruity
and
yeasty
but
with
a
bit
more
of
that
oily
orange
peel
bitterness
taste
is
a
little
drier
a
little
yeastier
the
flavours
are
melding
into
a
more
glorious
whole
and
losing
a
bit
of
their
distinctiveness
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
ill
come
back
to
this
in
a
another
year
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
wholeheartedly
believe
that
la
fin
du
monde
can
stand
up
to
any
beer
in
belgium
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
and
on
several
occasions
i
have
this
hazy
masterpiece
should
be
savored
but
its
so
tasty
you
cant
help
but
to
pound
these
down
truly
a
ray
of
light
on
an
otherwise
cloudy
day
a
decent
brew
but
probably
my
least
favorite
offering
to
date
from
unibroue
the
color
is
hazy
peack
with
2
fingers
of
head
that
falls
to
a
quarter
inch
over
the
beer
looks
nice
the
nose
is
really
strong
in
fruity
esters
a
good
belgian
nose
i
dig
it
the
flavor
is
good
and
sweet
with
lots
of
the
fruity
chatacters
coming
through
nice
malty
characters
in
this
beer
the
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
nice
body
on
a
good
beer
drinkability
is
good
for
a
9
beer
it
was
easy
and
smooth
and
just
good
all
around
this
is
truly
an
all
season
brew
summer
or
winter
this
concoction
is
consistent
delicious
and
dangerously
easy
to
drink
oh
canada
land
of
the
3
gallon
per
flush
toilet
and
home
of
the
unibroue
brewery
poured
a
beautiful
clear
gold
with
a
vouminous
frothy
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
leaving
nice
belgian
lace
behind
aroma
is
dry
with
an
apple
like
ester
and
some
clean
pale
malt
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
begins
with
a
a
smooth
sweet
maltiness
that
is
reminscent
of
a
pale
bock
in
that
it
has
a
light
cereal
sweetness
the
flavor
soon
segues
into
a
hoppy
flavor
that
makes
itself
known
but
is
not
bitter
or
overpowering
the
flavor
finishes
with
no
heat
or
any
indicator
of
the
high
level
of
alcohol
this
brew
contains
which
to
me
makes
it
a
perfect
beer
to
introduce
a
friend
into
the
pleasure
of
a
belgian
style
beer
very
beautiful
beer
though
it
definetly
commands
respect
as
it
goes
down
smoother
than
a
glass
of
milk
unibroue
is
one
of
the
most
consistent
north
american
breweries
around
and
la
fin
is
another
perfect
example
of
why
they
have
such
a
reputation
with
craft
beer
fans
drinkability
a
great
ale
which
comes
in
a
4
pack
which
should
be
perfect
to
last
me
through
tonights
baseball
game
go
sox
drinkability
one
of
the
more
drinkable
belgians
ive
had
the
privilege
to
try
a
most
excellent
brew
champange
like
mouthfeel
bubbly
but
with
a
creamy
quality
to
the
finish
i
seem
to
be
nearly
done
with
the
beer
without
noticing
doing
so
and
i
dont
have
a
drinking
problem
i
promise
so
i
guess
its
damn
drinkable
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
doubt
i
could
have
another
and
not
be
beset
by
the
pain
of
toorapid
inebriation
and
overload
of
powerful
flavor
store
this
beer
i
beg
you
in
my
review
for
maudite
i
mentioned
that
you
can
definitely
notice
the
8
abv
but
i
didnt
notice
the
9
abv
in
la
fin
du
monde
at
all
im
not
sure
ill
ever
drink
a
beer
i
like
more
than
this
in
my
entire
life
smells
and
tastes
relatively
sweet
and
is
a
pretty
cloudy
golden
color
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
incredible
as
the
alcohol
is
hidden
so
well
that
i
could
drink
this
like
forever
now
that
ive
tried
unibroue
im
gonna
save
them
for
nice
occasions
since
i
cant
live
my
life
spending
this
much
on
beer
drinkability
is
huge
only
restriction
is
the
9
abv
otherwise
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
very
good
beer
i
like
most
of
unibroues
offerings
but
this
is
a
new
one
for
me
very
drinkable
despite
being
9
alcohol
i
love
this
beer
this
poured
out
a
murky
golden
orange
with
about
a
halfinch
of
white
foam
sitting
atop
the
body
no
lace
was
left
as
this
was
consumed
aroma
was
very
spicy
with
notes
of
a
lemony
zest
and
a
bit
of
yeast
as
well
the
taste
stays
true
to
the
smell
with
spiciness
really
dominating
with
a
touch
of
fruit
over
a
doughy
backbone
lemon
and
apple
notes
were
the
most
distinguishable
a
nice
spicy
bitter
after
taste
ending
this
lovely
brew
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
with
about
a
medium
body
drinkability
was
good
and
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
in
the
future
all
around
good
brew
well
i
finally
got
ahold
of
this
guy
and
am
i
ever
glad
that
i
did
the
color
is
of
a
typical
triple
light
in
color
however
i
had
very
little
head
that
didnt
stick
around
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
that
typical
lovely
belgian
smell
with
sweet
smells
of
citrus
and
sourness
the
taste
came
as
a
shock
this
beer
is
as
good
as
everyone
says
it
is
complex
and
just
all
round
wonderful
fruity
and
a
hint
of
hops
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
and
a
mouthfeel
that
you
dont
want
to
miss
especially
when
you
can
feel
it
run
across
your
tounge
like
a
nice
cold
peice
of
ice
or
something
like
that
anyway
i
glad
i
only
got
a
4
pack
at
9
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
last
much
longer
i
am
sure
these
will
all
be
gone
soon
drinkability
very
high
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
i
cant
drink
them
everyday
as
they
are
high
in
abv
not
a
session
brew
but
great
for
a
little
something
special
once
in
awhile
great
stuff
this
is
no
doubt
a
good
beer
it
pours
almost
a
dissapointingly
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
head
lace
that
remains
fairly
well
the
smell
is
spicy
with
hints
of
fruit
the
taste
is
indeed
strong
and
over
the
top
as
advertised
the
alcohol
comes
through
strongly
as
expected
the
clove
spicincess
of
the
yeast
leads
into
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
i
am
not
sure
if
i
am
missing
something
here
but
to
me
this
is
a
good
but
not
neccassirily
worldclass
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
sticks
around
the
aroma
has
a
fruity
and
citruslike
feel
the
flavor
is
yeasty
and
malty
and
has
some
fruit
character
the
alcohol
is
also
apparent
in
the
taste
great
carbonation
very
good
for
the
tripel
style
great
representation
ill
have
this
one
again
and
again
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
a
very
good
representation
of
the
triple
style
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
style
ales
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
smaller
fizzy
white
head
small
bubbles
continuously
run
up
the
side
of
my
glass
giving
the
beer
a
nice
ring
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
wonderfully
sweet
malty
smell
some
citrus
and
many
floral
accents
the
taste
is
a
very
sweet
malty
flavour
much
like
the
nose
great
belgian
taste
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
it
is
hidden
pretty
well
under
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
clean
but
very
carbonated
my
mouth
is
tingling
from
the
effervescence
and
alcohol
this
beer
is
wonderful
and
i
feel
i
could
drink
this
forever
had
i
not
read
a
review
for
this
beer
i
would
have
never
picked
it
up
for
the
goofy
label
quite
decent
though
citrus
and
bannana
aroma
tasted
almost
like
a
hefe
at
first
clove
and
floral
hops
came
next
short
lived
head
and
carbonation
by
the
time
i
finnished
the
750ml
bottle
the
taste
was
a
bit
too
lingering
perhaps
it
got
a
bit
too
much
air
good
value
for
a
belgian
strong
ale
though
overall
impression
this
is
a
personal
favorite
and
i
saved
it
to
put
a
splash
into
my
mug
for
my
250th
karma
point
this
beer
turned
me
on
to
belgian
styles
and
made
me
a
huge
fan
of
unibroue
in
general
the
yeast
ties
it
to
its
cousins
trois
pistoles
and
don
de
dieu
but
la
fin
is
drier
and
cleaner
this
is
a
great
special
occasion
beer
ive
tried
to
turn
a
few
people
on
to
great
beer
with
this
one
but
its
a
bit
heavy
and
strong
for
most
of
the
macro
drinking
crowd
personally
this
rocked
my
world
at
first
taste
while
this
isnt
a
perfect
5
beer
its
darn
close
drinkability
in
the
short
term
is
hampered
by
the
heavy
handed
9
abv
but
i
tend
to
buy
this
stuff
by
the
case
i
cant
recommend
this
strongly
enough
to
my
fellow
bas
that
may
not
have
tried
this
its
a
must
taste
beer
poured
a
frothy
threefinger
head
atop
a
golden
orange
slightly
cloudy
brew
into
a
tulip
it
looked
so
refreshing
the
aroma
was
spicy
cidery
and
fruity
the
immediate
tangible
smell
was
sour
green
apples
if
i
took
a
big
enough
inhale
i
could
feel
the
alcohol
in
my
nose
tastewise
it
was
tangy
sweet
and
sour
once
again
with
a
focus
on
an
applelike
flavor
with
a
nice
warmth
from
the
high
abv
it
sometimes
reminded
me
of
reisling
andor
champagne
maybe
a
white
grape
twang
in
there
too
for
all
the
apparent
sweet
tastes
each
taste
ended
up
surprisingly
dry
drinking
it
reminded
me
of
duvel
sometimes
and
orval
other
times
strange
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
wonderful
effervescent
and
smooth
obvioulsy
like
other
beers
with
high
abvs
as
it
warmed
and
was
consumed
the
alcohol
became
more
and
more
apparent
all
in
all
a
very
solid
brew
drinkability
very
tasty
with
a
distinct
yeasty
character
well
made
as
good
a
tripel
as
you
will
find
what
a
great
beer
la
fin
du
monde
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
must
be
accorded
the
respect
a
9
abv
beer
is
due
it
went
great
with
my
dinner
and
to
relax
with
as
i
settled
into
the
evening
definitely
worth
picking
up
750
ml
brown
bottle
topped
with
cork
bottled

taste
honeysweet
at
first
with
alcohol
rushing
in
and
slightly
numbing
the
tongue
very
warming
and
quickly
causes
facial
flush
slightly
cloying
at
times
until
the
swallow
after
which
the
taste
is
dry
and
very
nearly
winelike
phenolic
is
really
the
dominant
taste

well

a
hazy
glowing

color
moderate
silky
white

this

is

and
hard

this
beer
has
a
powerful
spicy
taste
and
a
malty
punch
slight
hops
combine
with
the
sharp
alcoholic

extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
an
outstanding
brew
and
a
great
conversion
brew
as
well
an
excellent
ale
do
try
this
one
notes
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
a
must
try
for
everyone
i
will
probably
try
this
one
again
when
i
see
it
to
see
if
that
bacon
flavor
was
an
anomaly
even
if
it
wasnt
it
was
still
worth
havin
again
received
this
corked
750ml
bottle
as
a
gift
it
had
been
sitting
on
top
of
a
fridge
for
over
a
year
exp
date
put
it
good
till
962005
i
thought
about
keeping
it
awhile
longer
but
couldnt
resist
uncorked
it
and
carbonation
slowly
fizzed
to
the
top
may
have
chilled
it
a
bit
too
much
when
it
began
to
drip
over
i
poured
it
had
a
nice
frothy
head
that
lasted
throughtout
the
glass
slightly
toned
down
toward
the
end
bubbles
also
lasted
throughout
like
a
good
champagne
the
color
was
cloudy
gold
smells
were
very
fruity
and
maybe
a
touch
floral
it
tasted
like
apples
pears
and
malt
not
bitter
at
all
as
it
warmed
it
did
take
on
an
alcohol
taste
still
nothing
like
i
would
have
expected
for
9
abv
seemed
almost
rich
in
mouthfeel
like
a
watered
down
milkshake
consistency
as
for
drinkability
i
found
that
it
was
gone
too
soon
quick
note
on
back
of
bottle
it
was
quite
clear
what
type
of
glass
it
should
be
drank
from
showed
correct
picture
then
a
big
x
through
incorrect
one
i
got
a
kick
out
of
that
it
pours
to
a
generous
white
foam
and
cloudy
gold
color
smell
is
floral
candylike
and
unbeerlike
but
good
smells
like
it
has
some
good
vitamins
in
itreal
nutritious
flavor
is
sweet
and
tangy
and
fruity
with
a
weird
after
taste
for
which
you
have
to
acquire
an
appreciation
its
not
awful
just
different
finishes
fruity
hops
are
detectable
this
beer
is
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
so
watch
out
for
the
buzz
its
like
a
hefe
on
steroids
a
unique
and
unforgettable
taste
sensation
i
just
put
a
few
imperial
stouts
in
the
basement
for
my
first
try
at
cellaring
ill
be
adding
one
of
these
babies
in
the
mix
to
see
just
how
complex
it
can
get
with
the
carbonation
and
alcohol
im
hoping
it
will
be
even
more
tasty
next
year
overall
i
consider
this
beer
to
be
the
greatest
beer
made
on
the
continent
of
north
america
and
the
best
beer
by
the
quebec
based
unibroue
this
is
a
phenomenal
belgianstyle
ale
but
also
very
artisinal
and
unique
for
its
style
there
are
simply
no
other
beers
in
the
world
like
this
one
this
is
a
musttry
brew
pours
a
thick
yellow
amber
color
with
a
beautiful
white
head
smells
very
yeasty
and
hoppy
i
love
the
carbonation
with
the
yeast
floating
in
it
very
good
looking
beer
tastes
nice
a
wonderful
balance
of
hops
and
flavor
i
expected
this
to
be
another
in
your
face
belgian
and
that
is
not
the
case
this
is
very
easy
drinking
a
lovely
pale
ale
to
be
savored
very
flavorful
without

my
favorite
beer
from
unibroue
that
has
made
my
list
after
having
read
about
this
beer
on
ba
for
some
time
now
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
it
this
past
weekend
and
i
think
i
have
a
new
candidate
for
favorite
beer
ok
lets
say
in
the
top
10
not
because
it
is
as
complex
as
some
others
ive
had
but
because
the
balance
is
just
right
on
and
i
felt
like
i
could
drink
it
and
keep
drinking
it
im
glad
i
didnt
that
9
abv
would
have
done
some
damage

of
medicine
but
in
a
good
way
this
is
some

stuff

did

this

a

overall
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
its
complex
and
its
quenching
i
love
bretts
and
i
loved
this
beer
flavor
is
moderately
lemony
with
sweet
pear
esters
and
a
light
musty
funk
the
brett
is
fairly
restrained
allowing
the
belgian
esters
to
shine
i
tried
this
beer
because
i
love
tripels
the
only
thing
i
liked
about
this
beer
was
the
look
disappointing
o
while
i
sometimes
dont
like
the
way
a
chardonnay
barrel
transforms
a
beer
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
due
to
the
nice
brett
tones
its
not
the
best
use
of
brett
ive
seen
in
an
anchorage
beer
but
overall
its
a
well
done
tripel
the
bar
has
been
set
for
bretted
out
tripels
this
beer
is
amazing
overall
i
think
this
has
aged
a
little
too
long
quite
a
mellow
beer
dominated
by
brett
with
white
wine
and
a
basic
tripel
following
it
in
a
very
back
seat
role
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
bold
flavorful
complexity
i
was
hoping
for
feels
fairly
muted
othis
is
a
great
beer
i
love
tripels
but
i
usually
prefer
more
traditional
examples
of
the
style
e
g
karmeliet
than
modern
funky
barrelaged
brews
this
beer
may
change
my
opinion
the
flavors
here
are
complex
subtle
and
manage
to
work
well
with
each
other
to
provide
a
nice
overall
package
the
mouthfeel
is
nearly
perfect
for
the
beer
too
this
would
work
well
with
food
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
great
example
of
a
barrel
aged
brett
beer
its
for
sure
not
a
true
example
of
a
tripel
but
theres
just
enough
tripel
aspects
coming
through
to
let
me
know
that
this
is
what
this
beer
started
as
but
over
a
year
and
half
its
became
a
pretty
unique
beer
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
fairly
crisp
refreshing
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
dont
think
i
would
have
any
problem
drinking
a
bottle
by
myself
it
would
make
for
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
the
porch
on
a
warmer
summer
day
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
aroma
and
drinkability
all
three
of
those
aspects
seemed
to
be
the
highlights
of
this
beer
for
me
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
is
nothing
but
im
not
a
fan
of
not
being
able
to
purchase
it
in
michigan
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
if
i
ever
saw
it
i
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
and
i
would
also
cellar
some
since
it
seems
to
hold
up
well
with
age
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
brett
beers
it
may
not
be
a
big
hit
to
most
tripel
fans
but
if
you
like
them
funky
then
you
should
like
this
beer
all
in
all
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
and
im
pretty
happy
i
decided
to
trade
for
this
one
its
for
sure
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
made
for
a
great
first
impression
for
anchorage
brewing
company
and
i
would
really
like
to
try
more
of
their
beers
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
funky
tripel
i
like
it
more
than
vivants
tripel
aged
for
a
year
this
is
just
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
i
dont
normally
pair
beer
with
things
besides
food
but
i
decided
to
listen
to
the
36
crazy
fists
album
this
beer
was
named
after
and
it
made
for
a
nice
pairing
great
job
guys
you
can
be
for
sure
ill
be
seeking
out
more
you
your
brews
keep
up
the
great
work
anchorage
brewing
has
a
winner
here
im
actually
not
the
biggest
fan
of
tripels
so
im
glad
this
isnt
heavy
on
the
characteristics
of
that
style
very
much
an
american
wild
interpretation
and
drinks
more
like
an
orval
saison
fruity
blond
mix
so
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
bomber
of
this
can
go
down
so
easy
and
get
you
on
a
high
horse
buzz
if
you
dont
watch
it
crushable
tenish
range
abv
tripel
mockery
all
up
in
this
bad
boy
brilliantly
conceived
collaboration
from
anchorage
and
dogfish
head
given
generously
to
me
by
a
new
friend
sorachi
ace
hopped
triple
in
chardonnay
barrels
with
brett
how
perfect
the
pour
is
hazy
yellow
pale
without
much
luster
but
a
masive
fizzy
white
head
that
hangs
on
for
quite
some
time
the
nose
is
really
oaky
and
acidic
from
the
wine
and
a
year
has
helped
the
brett
do
its
magic
lots
of
funk
here
the
sorachi
hops
arent
as
prominent
as
i
would
like
them
to
be
but
i
get
the
lemon
without
the
bitter
taste
is
more
balanced
but
the
wine
still
makes
a
big
impact
wheat
malt
and
maybe
oats
this
is
the
best
of
all
three
fermentation
worlds
complexity
is
ripe
distinctly
belgina
in
nature
but
nuanced
in
a
remarkable
way
the
hops
finish
beautifully
with
the
brett
and
while
i
have
to
imagine
they
have
faded
some
the
balance
found
here
is
divine
finish
is
long
too
zesty
funky
and
memorable
beautiful
carbonation
and
a
lightness
rare
for
its
abv
i
could
drink
this
everyday
its
like
nothing
else
a
gorgeous
combination
of
flavors
and
techniques
here
a
real
work
of
craftsmanship
if
i
hadnt
paid
17
for
this
bomber
i
might
be
more
apt
to
drink
it
regularly
i
guess
its
not
a
regular
brew
anyway
anchorage
to
new
hampshire
is
quite
a
trip
i
wonder
what
it
tasted
like
a
year
ago
pours
light
grain
yellow
with
brilliant
clarity
and
a
solid
quilt
of
bone
whites
smells
really
nice
with
lemons
pineapple
grain
clay
a
little
green
olive
juice
flavor
doesnt
disappoint
nice
bitterness
some
grass
some
almost
teatree
oil
and
leather
with
a
bit
of
metal
thin
bodied
with
hi
carb
and
a
wet
finish
nice
beer
taste
is
not
a
letdown
after
the
excellent
nose
glad
to
come
across
something
like
this
every
once
in
a
while
that
you
have
never
heard
of
and
dont
have
any
expectations
the
brett
is
bold
yet
soft
melds
with
the
malt
so
seamlessly
the
wood
and
wine
tartness
is
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
tripel
the
base
beer
tastes
like
it
is
pretty
damn
good
in
its
own
right
light
grassy
bitterness
and
delicate
yeast
is
a
perfect
combination
great
beer
buy
it
if
you
see
it
o
definitely
doesnt
go
light
on
the
wine
barrel
presence
which
obscures
the
base
beer
and
the
brett
profile
a
bit
perhaps
it
would
benefit
from
less
time
in
the
barrel
or
a
more

this
is
a
fantastic

with
brett
big
complexity
and
balance
of
all
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
sip
on
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
the
only
thing
missing
from
this
maelstrom
is
a
kraken
anyway
this
stuff
pours

zest
a
hint
of
tart
chardonnay
grapes
a
touch
of
mild
biscuit
and
a
stiff
breeze
of
earthy
brett
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
bit
more
of
that
tart
chardonnay
character
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
i
cant
say
this
resembles
a
traditional
tripel
all
that
closely
but
the
bright
citrus
tart
wine
and
earthy
brett
all
combine
together
into
a
very
tasty
melange
screw
style
guidelines
this
stuff
is
damn
good
overall
i
bet
if
you
took
the
brett
out
of
this
it
would
be
another
mediocre
american
tripel
brett
helps
this
out
a
lot
this
is
an
extremely
unique
beer
ive
really
tasted
nothing
else
quite
like
it
what
with
the
remarkable
qualities
provided
by
the
brett
and
the
chardonnay
barrel
fermentation
its
really
a
musttry
trailblazing
belgian
ale
if
you
ask
me
overall
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
in
the
tripel
style
but
it
just
doesnt
drink
like
a
tripel
to
me
the
brett
really
dominates
in
a
way
that
makes
this
one
feel
more
like
a
saison
than
a
tripel
based
on
that
i
have
to
dock
the
overall
score
just
a
bit
even
though
i
really
liked
it
either
way
an
awfully
tasty
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
though
i
really
dislike
diacetyl
its
mild
enough
not
to
be
a
dealbreaker
if
that
particular
trait
doesnt
bother
you
though
this
beer
is
absolutely
well
worth
trying
overall
definitely
a
tasty
brett
beer
funky
and
refreshing
ive
passed
this
over
at
the
store
a
lot
and
ill
be
sure
to
get
one
if
i
see
it
on
the
shelves
again
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
nice
dose
of
brett
4
25
m
medium
bodied
clean
od
cool
beer
couldnt
pick
up
any
alcohol
and
the
brett
character
was
good
if
a
bit
too
dominant
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
tripels
but
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
due
to
the
earthy
funk
and
tartness
keeping
the
sweetnessalcohol
in
check
feels
satisfying
and
paired
well
with
food
stuffed
bell
peppers
in
this
case
o
quenching
refreshing
and
totally
perfect
on
a
late
spring
night
the
only
thing
preventing
even
higher
scores
from
this
reviewer
is
that
it
wasnt
the
most
complex
drinking
experience
with
the
yeast
asserting
itself
so
dominantly
that
said
it
tastes
great
a
treat
and

this

despite

is
a

sipper
very
smooth
and
very
tasty
o
holy
cow
is
this
good
anchorage
knows
how
to
make
some
solid
beers
and
this
one
is
fantastic
it
isnt
your
run
of
the
mill
tripel
and
the
brett
and
chardonnay
barrels
brings
an
interesting
side
to
things
worth
every
penny
and
a
must
try
this
one
took
me
from
eager
anticipation
to
fear
to
delight
in
a
matter
of
moments
the
description
on
the
bottle
made
it
sound
amazing
and
the
pour
to
a
tulip
only
got
me
more
fired
up
with
such
a
strong
golden
color
however
when
i
raised
the
glass
to
my
nose
i
smelled
chicken
coop
it
was
a
smell
i
hadnt
really
gotten
that
strong
since
my
childhood
on
a
farm
and
i
have
to
admit
it
was
not
a
good
memory
i
was
curious
if
it
was
a
bad
bottle
but
order
was
soon
restored
when
i
tasted
it
there
were
those
familiar
belgian
yeast
notes
but
in
a
faded
distant
kind
of
way
they
quickly
gave
way
to
the
brett
but
again
not
in
as
strong
a
way
as
in
other
wildstyle
ales
there
was
such
a
collaborative
effort
between
the
flavors
and
it
made
for
a
fairly
unique
taste
experience
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
certainly
buy
it
again
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
i
love
the
combination
of
the
belgian
tripel
flavorsaromas
with
those
contributed
by
the
brett
and
the
chardonnay
barrels
o
this
is
definitely
not
your
average
tripel
the
barrel
and
brett
character
add
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
without
overwhelming
any
of
the
base
beers
characteristics
quite
expensive
but
very
nicely
done
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
very
nice
white
head
on
top
the
retention
is
good
as
well
as
the
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
really
good
sweet
and
citric
aroma
incredibly
balanced
really
pleasant
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
really
well
balanced
also
sweet
maltiness
with
a
great
balance
of
brett
with
a
hint
of
spice
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
yet
soft
there
is
a
slight
creaminess
to
it
really
nice
overall
its
very
good
the
addition
of
brett
adds
a
really
nice
additional
element
to
the
beer
very
good
stuff
tasty
and
complex
it
could
use
a
higher
carbonation
level
and
the
hopping
is
subdued
though
perhaps
batch
2
when
its
fresh
could
be
superior
overall
a
nicely
balanced
beer
nothing
wrong
but
nothing
stands
out
either
ultimately
it
is
exactly
what
it
is
a
blonde
tripel
that
highlights
the
brett
the
body
was
on
the
light
side
of
medium
for
the
style
and
was
very
dry
especially
for
a
tripel
drinkability
was
excellent
if
you
dig
the
funk
and
would
be
ok
even
if
you
werent
overall
a
very
nice
brew
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
a
must
try
if
you
see
it
pleasant
but
not
quite
as
well
harnessed
as
others
in
the
same
ballpark
sort
of
genre
that
ive
tried
o
very
tasty
and
drinkable
d
solid
beer
really
like
the
anchorage
beers
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
flemish
primitive
series
o
this
one
improved
drastically
as
it
warmed
the
zest
tart
and
oak
came
out
of
the
glass
almost
like
an
explosion
with
a
little
bit
of
warmth
and
time
loved
the
oak
and
citrus
flavors
that
balanced
the
funk
glad
i
got
this
bottle
overall
very
good
a
nice
twist
on
the
tripel
style
i
had
been
looking
for
this
one
for
awhile
and
while
i
spent
too
much
for
it
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
the
brett
ran
away
with
this
beer
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
glass
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
amber
with
a
two
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
constantly
refreshed
by
active
carbonation
aroma
of
light
fruit
lemon
butter
and
wild
yeast
flavor
of
lemon
orange
brett
light
malt
slightly
vinous
finishes
with
a
hint
of
wood
dry
tartness
and
residual
yeast
light
to
medium
bodied
with
nice
sharpness
from
the
carbonation
closer
in
style
to
an
american
wild
ale
than
a
tripel
with
a
very
light
touch
of
belgian
not
my
style
but
enjoyable
as
a
interestingly
flavored
well
made
wild
yeast
influenced
ale
another
great
beer
from
anchorage
although
this
one
is
a
little
less
flashy
than
some
of
their
others
drinks
much
easier
than
9
percent
which
was
wellhidden
o
this
is
a
really
great
play
in
beer
styles
and
combining
ingredients
together
best
way
i
can
think
of
is
a
fruit
forward
tripel
mixed
with
orval
o
light
tart
zesty
fruity
estery
classic
tripel
with
a
twist
from
the
funky
tart
brett
notes
o
excellent
cloudy
pale
gold
topped
by
a
big
pillowy
head
of
froth
flowery
sweet
aromas
over
yeasty
funk
lemon
zest
wood
chardonnay
light
phenols
and
a
dusty
tartness
a
hint
of
vanilla
bean
as
it
warms
the
flavor
is
initially
surprisingly
spiced
upfront
before
melding
with
citrus
cedar
earth
and
a
white
wine
dryness
the
brett
is
of
course
quite
noticeable
and
adds
a
nice
mustybarnyard
funk
complexity
to
the
mix
fruity
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
crispness
creamy
and
soft
yet
effervescent
and
quite
dry
a
slight
warmth
is
growing
in
my
throat
but
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
like
this
a
lot
its
hard
to
put
this
up
against
other
tripels
because
of
the
brettbarrelaged
qualities
but
its
is
a
fine
beer
all
around
o
great
balance
and
complexity
delicious
notes
not
necessarily
a
big
fan
of
triples
but
im
a
big
fan
of
this
one
o
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
its
not
something
ill
pick
up
again
at
15
its
not
worth
the
premium
over
a
standard
tripel

pale
blonde

this
is

very

and
something
i
would
love
another
chance
at
having
pours
pale

with
a
smallish
white

slight
haze
probably
just
from
some
of
the
lees
kicking
up

belgian
notes
lots
of

taste

with
more
fruity
sweetness
but
quickly
dries

and
picks
up
spicy
and
sour
flavors
theres
a
bit
of
booze
to
it
a
little
too
tannic
for
my
taste
the
oak
is
strong
funky
sour
finish
feel
is
light
but
a
bit
boozy
a
very
good
beer
and
an
excellent
and
interesting
take
on
the
style
unfortunately
its
a
little
too
strong
for
the
sourness
and
the
oak
is
just
a
bit
much
for
me
still
its
always
great
to
try
an
anchorage
beer
nothing
but
hits
from
that
brewery
so
far
yup
another
masterful
addition
from
anchorage
to
their
already
masterful
range
the
chardonnay
i
thought
was
subtle
but
it
turns
out
to
be
the
defining
factor
of
this
beer
the
more
you
drink
its
a
very
interesting
result
golden

with
a

floral

quite

and

delicious
and
complex
i
could
have
this
in
my
glass
on
any
warm
day
or
any
day
of
the
year
really
overall
a
nice
twist
on
the
tripel
style
that
is
growing
on
me
wish
i
held
onto
the
bottle
a
bit
longer
oh
well
still
awesome
after
sitting
in
the
bottle
for
a
year
now
i
have
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
their
other
brews
too
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
prominent
barrel
presence
that
adds
complexity
without
interfering
with
the
hops
and
wild
yeast
notes
some
charred
oak
along
with
vanilla
and
buttery
white
wine
flavor
which
is
countered
by
a
dry
bitter
pine
presence
and
a
strong
musty
brett
character
the
wild
yeast
provides
some
dry
earthy
funk
that
compliments
the
resinous
hop
flavor
and
gives
balance
to
the
tropical
and
vinous
fruit
sweetness
underneath
the
barrel
and
wild
yeast
there
are
hints
of
citrus
peel
apple
pear
and
alcohol
but
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
making
this
complex
beer
pretty
quaffable
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
but
the
wine
barrel
earthy
hops
and
funky
yeast
notes
are
almost
perfectly
balanced
resulting
in
another
excellent
beer
from
this
brewery
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
if
i
had
to
find
a
fault
with
it
it
would
be
that
from
memory
i
cant
really
tell
the
difference
between
this
and
the
anchorage
wit
that
i
had
a
while
back
there
is
nothing
in
this
beer
that
screams
tripel
to
me
with
that
said
if
you
like
brettanomyces
this
is
like
a
nice
complex
gueuze
only
not
as
sour
o
kind
of
a
hybrid
sour
tripel
but
really
good
and
exceptionally
refreshing
o
this
is
unique
among
tripels
ive
had
the
bourbon
barrelaged
tripel
the
sweet
fruity
tripel
the
tripel
brewed
with
rice
etc
but
it
seems
the
combination
of
brettanomyces
yeast
and
barrelaging
produces
a
very
distinct
beer
which
reminded
me
of
an
american
wild
ale
blended
with
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
this
was
a
rugged
beer
you
have
to
try
it
but
how
youll
feel
about
the
chardonnay
barrel
flavors
with
the
brett
influence
is
probably
a
matter
of
taste
i
liked
it
and
while
partial
to
the
curieux
karmeliet
and
westmallestyle
tripels
this
beer
definitely
has
an
elegance
of
its
own
been
looking
forwards
to
this
one
as
i
do
love
a
nice
brew
aged
in
chardonay
barrels
and
it
pours
a
hazed
golden
hue
which
leaves
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
lacing
everywhere
very
nice
lookingthe
smell
is
barnhouse

and
a

with

and
finished
with
a
funky

dryness
and
overall
its
a
nice
drop
with
a
beautiful
touch
of
brett
to
give
you
that
funky
sour
dryness
and
with
the
weather
like
it
is
today
its
definately
i
could
drink
more
than
one
bottle
of
cheers
o
to
say
this
is
a
complex
beer
is
an
understatement
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
and
its
all
very
very
good
its
a
sipping
thinking
beer
not
one
to
have
while
youre
mindlessly
eating
peanuts
at
a
ballgame
but
a
wonderful
beer
and
im
very
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
good
beer
but
it
is
very
different
i
have
had
many
tripels
this
one
stands
out
in
many
different
ways
with
its
yeasty
taste
and
everlasting
taste
of
lemons
you
get
the
feel
of
what
complex
is
salud
interesting
and
quite
complex
lots
of
stuff
going
on
but
it
just
barely
escapes
being
an
everything
bagel
awesome
warm
feeling
after
drinking
just
one
glass
of
this
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
an
anchorage
brewing
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
them
i
absolutely
love
the
restrained
earthen
character
of
anchorage
brewing
companys
ales
they
know
how
to
create
distinctive
ales
that
adhere
to
the
styles
prescription
very
well
while
injecting
the
rustic
and
artistic
attributes
that
separate
them
from
the
pretenders
in
the
belgianstyle
beer
market
great
job
again

that
was

this
hot

a
golden

with

aromas
of
straw
and
grass
with
a
definite
oak
and
white
wine
note
theres
a
mild
fruity
tartness
to
the
nose
and
just
a
hint
of
funk
the
flavor
has
a
surprising
touch
of
bitterness
but
perhaps
its
just
tanninsastringency
white
wine
light
fruits
and
a
subtle
lactic
tartness
to
go
along
with
the
bready
malt
flavor
and
soft
sweetness
good
but
love
buzz
is
still
my
favorite
thus
far
from
this
brewery
m
medium
body
with
a
massive
chew
creamy
light
carbonation
i
would
let
this
warm
as
it
is
very
hard
to
drink
at
room
temperature
pick
up
a
bomber
and
share
it
with
a
friend
drinkability
is
crazy
high
a
world
class
beer
pours
hazy
burnt
orange
with
fading
lacy
white
foam
the
initial
smell
is
that
of
bubble
gum
and
champagne
the
flavor
is
easy
with
a
hint
of
orange
and
alcohol
there
is
a
spicy
note
on
the
back
of
the
throat
after
the
second
sip
very
good
flavor
quality
and
overall
example
of
an
american
triple
the
chardoannay
shines
through
fairly
well
but
does
not
take
away
from
the
essence
of
the
brett
within
there
is
no
cloying
afterbite
in
this
brew
definitely
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
overall
the
tide
and
its
takers
is
a
solid
beer
but
is
just
not
interesting
enough
with
the
barrel
aging
and
the
brett
i
expected
the
beer
to
be
much
fuller
in
terms
of
both
complexity
and
power
o
enjoyable
liked
the
brett
funk
of
course
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
not
my
favourite
from
anchorage
though
used
to
alot
more
brett
with
my
anchorage
beers
note

a
very
interesting
beer
for
sure
but
not
sure
if
it
really
flowed
well
for
me
pours
a
bubble
yellow
color
huge
white
head
to
it
yeasty
smell
taste
is
of
champagne
brett
very
sour
kind
of
an
odd
mouthfeel
seems
like
a
lot
of
work
went
into
the
beer
with
aging
in
different
vessels
but
the
overall
product
didnt
taste
the
best
in
my
opinion
not
bad
but
probably
would
never
try
this
again
reminded
me
too
much
of
wine
when
i
just
wanted
a
tasty
beer
notes
really
nice
and
interesting
tripel
solid
beer
brett
is
definitely
there
but
it
doesnt
take
over
the
tripel
chardonnay
provided
only
a
touch
of
flavor
definitely
worth
picking
up
o
this
is
a
beer
thats
about
as
close
to
a
belgian
beer
that
youll
find
in
this
country
extremely
drinkable
overall
amazing
beer
this
is
just
the
perfect
blend
of
all
the
flavors
starting
with
a
nice
belgian
tripel
with
good
belgian
yeast
additions
light
spices
and
esters
citrus
fruit
etc
then
add
the
nice
brett
flavor
to
add
some
wild
funk
in
the
background
that
doesnt
take
over
the
beer
then
on
top
of
all
that
some
crisp
fruity
flavorful
chardonnay
wine
flavors
and
to
top
it
all
off
as
the
cherry
on
top
the
rounding
from
the
toasty
buttery
oak
maybe
the
perfect
spring
beer
pours
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
some
lace
hazy
pale
amber
color

not
quite
sure
what
sam
calaglone
dogfish
head
is
doing
looks
like
moral
support
for
anchorage
brewing
d
im
curious
if
these
are
second
or
thirduse
barrels
as
the
chardonnay
flavor
is
far
less
assertive
than
some
of
gabes
other
offerings
i
found
this
easier
to
drink
and
would
put
it
somewhere
between
the
awesome
bitter
monk
and
the
mildly
disappointing
love
buzz
in
any
case
really
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
o
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
slight
sourness
on
it
but
it
was
pleasant
o
i
am
now
officially
excited
about
what
anchorage
brewing
has
to
offer
and
im
certainly
glad
i
bought
their
white
ipa
when
i
had
the
chance
after
further
inspection
it
looks
like
this
had
something
to
do
with
dogfish
head
as
sam
calagiones
name
and
signature
are
on
the
label
makes
sensethis
beers
astounding
a
record
dogfish
head
is
not
unfamiliar
with
overall
another
great
beer
from
anchorage
basically
exactly
what
i
imagined
a
brettfermented
chardonnayaged
tripel
would
smell
and
taste
like
pours
hazy
gold
with
a
dense
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
cap
leaving
rings
of
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
wonderful
aromas
of
yellow
apple
lemon
zest
light
belgian
yeast
and
funky
brettanomyces
all
wrapped
up
in
a
lovely
white
grape
barrel
taste
is
similarly
funky
with
lots
of
earthy
brettanomyces
citrusforward
hops
ripe
pear
and
a
solid
tripel
base
of
banana
and
clove
very
nice
blend
of
the
traditional
tripel
and
the
funk
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
feels
surprisingly
light
given
the
9
abv
body
is
a
touch
over
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
ample
overall
another
great
anchorage
beer
keep
em
coming
taste
just
what
i
thought
this
is
primo
stuff
brett
always
gives
a
beer
a
special
twist
this
beer
is
intensely
flavored
yet
it
all
balances
out
i
dont
find
that
often
the
taste
is
brett
malt
apricot
sweet
background
and
some
spiciness
also
citrus
oil
or
peel
but
it
is
a
back
ground
flavor
which
is
unusual
and
very
appealing
this
is
really
a
good
tripel
in
my
opinion
a
little
pricy
but
i
am
loving
every
sip
about
13
for
a
750
o
this
is
another
home
run
from
anchorage
i
dunno
too
much
about
the
brewery
besides
they
are
making
world
class
beers
that
are
hard
to
find
but
avalible
for
just
about
anyone
with
a
keen
eye
keep
up
the
great
work
gabe
and
ill
keep
buying
these
a
unique
experience
and
worth
every
penny
another
solid
offering
from
anchorage
gabe
is
an
amazing
brewer
and
designer
of
exquisite
beers
and
hes
helping
me
learn
to
like
brett
like
all
abc
beers
i
have
had
so
far
the
brett
element
is
absolutely
a
central
component
of
the
beer
but
yet
doesnt
dominate
it
and
while
this
beer
may
not
be
as
bold
and
have
as
many
ingredients
as
some
the
subtle
nuance
of
what
is
there
presents
with
the
synergy
and
delicate
perfection
of
a
polished
symphony
orchestra
i
suspect
that
something
like
the
finished
product
is
what
he
had
in
mind
and
that
hitting
that
target
is
something
not
a
whole
lot
of
brewers
can
do
o
because
of
the
bretts
in
this
it
changes
quite
a
bit
over
the
course
of
a
pour
opens
up
mellows
out
becoming
less
tart
and
a
bit
sweeter
and
really
develops
a
lot
of
complexity
d
very
drinkable
good
complexity
added
to
the
beer
from
the
brett
and
oak
the
balance
of
flavors
is
really
nice
from
start
to
end
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
bottle
poured
a
hazy
medium
orangey

with
a
large

head
with
good

aroma
of
light

notes
with
some
dry

notes
and
lightly
sweet

notes
taste
is
a
quiet
complex
mix
between
some
brett
notes
with
light
funky
ester
mix
in
with
nobel
dry
hops
and
some
sweet

with
a
light

with
good

and
no

very
well
brewed
with
good

and
nice
drinkability
factor
o
an
interesting
take
on
a
beer
and
i
loved
it
it
was
beautiful
i
went
to
steins
the
next
day
and
bought
two
bottles
to
bring
home
overall
its
an
interesting
take
probably
not
what
i
look
for
in
this
favorite
style
of
mine
but
its
an
incredibly
well
crafted
beer
i
expect
nothing
but
great
things
from
this
place
and
they
just
deliver
in
spades
t
the
chardonnay
barrel
really
comes
into
play
here
lots
of
vinous
character
upfront
with
some
brett
chalky
yeast
and
lemon
with
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
and
clove
on
the
finish
never
gets
close
to
the
sweetness
a
lot
of
other
tripels
have
which
i
think
is
a
really
nice
touch
really
delicious
stuff
flavorful

could
drink
this

refer
this

fans
who
need
to
convert
thanks
reza
o
so
far
my
favorite
of
anchorages
offerings
and
a
very
solid
brett
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
overthetop
brett
beers
but
this
one
was
very
well
balanced
with
bitterness
and
barrel
flavors
o
an
interesting
take
on
a
bretty
tripel
the
brett
and
wood
barrel
are
not
that
apparent
but
very
balanced
grapes
seem
to
make
a
strong
presence
in
the
finish
which
is
very
nice
really
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
overall
an
ok
beer
probably
my
least
favorite
by
them
i
like
the
brett
but
its
a
bit
sweet
and
i
dont
think
it
plays
well
the
the
belgian
yeast
o
i
think
of
this
beer
more
like
a
saison
than
a
tripel
because
of
the
influences
from
the
brett
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
which
could
make
this
one
quite
dangerous
at
9
abv
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
this
one
again
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
grain
lemon
earth
and
brett
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
along
with
some
wood
and
white
wine
aromas
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
and
interesting
take
on
a
tripel
and
the
best
of
the
anchorage
beers
i
have
tried
so
far
o
a
different
take
on
a
tripel
but
its
an
outstanding
brew
another
great
one
from
anchorage
beer
is
light
in
body
im
not
super
impressed
with
the
beer
i
was
expecting
more
from
these
guys
at
this
point
i
love
their
other
beers
but
this
is
just
a
plain
tripel
fine
i
suppose
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
though
o
overall
a
really
nice
beer
im
a
sucker
for
oranges
and
brett
and
this
one
has
a
lot
of
each
very
nice
would
like
to
have
it
again
the
flavor
is
also
pretty
brett
heavy
but
also
has
notes
of
oak
yeast
spice
and
a
bit
of
hops
medium
body
with
spritzy
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
earthy
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
anchorages
other
offerings
but
still
quite
tasty
overall
nontraditional
but
tasty
the
chardonnay
barrel
and
brett
are
nice
touches
probably
not
my
favorite
anchorage
brew
but
its
still
great
and
they
are
without
a
doubt
masters
of
the
brett
craft
the
beer
is
straw
yellow
and
hazy
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
brings
some
yeast
a
bit
of
citrus
lemon
zest
hard
to
believe
this
is
9
abv
nice
flavor
light
bodied
with
some
mildly
tart
citrus
yeast
not
a
traditional
tripel
but
more
of
a
hybrid
with
a
considerable
yeast
and
funk
presence
really
nice
would
have
again
jd
purchased
upon
recommendation
at
healthy
spirits
in
san
fran
lite
citrusy
crisp
smells
wonderful
i
taste
hints
of
dried
fruits
like
dates
or
prunes
chardonnay
clearly
drives
the
flavor
excellent
finish
semisweet
did
i
just
taste
banana
halfinch
of
foam
more
carbonated
than
a
chimay
white
or
a
brothers
david
dry
refreshing
aftertaste
lingers
quite
lovely
o
light
and
nice
another
winner
for
anchorage
i
cant
wait
to
visit
the
brewery
this
is
a
tasty
number
i
would
love
to
have
more
of
these
to
age
but
i
found
only
the
one
there
is
enough
residual
sugars
left
behind
for
the
brett
to
carry
on
its
way
over
time
and
really
develop
this
beer
into
something
else
its
solid
now
and
i
bet
would
get
even
better
certainly
worth
the
try
surprised
i
paid
the
same
amount
for
this
as
i
did
the
ipa
the
ipa
should
have
been
less
big
thanks
goes
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
recent
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
bread
fruit
and
subtle
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
wood
and
very
subtle
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
the
flavor
and
aroma
going
on
in
this
one
was
very
solid
and
enjoyable
this
made
this
one
really
easy
to
drink
a
definite
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
pleasant
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
rich
orangish
gold
in
color
with
a
two
finger
soapy
white
head
the
nose
is
funky
and
full
of
brett
with
a
nice
amount
of
buttery
chardonnay
oak
the
flavor
consists
of
plenty
of
belgian
yeast
bitter
hops
buttery
charddonnay
barrel
and
very
dry
brett
its
nice
and
what
i
kind
of
expected
but
not
quite
complex
as
i
had
hoped
its
nice
and
has
traditional
characteristics
of
a
triple
that
said
its
a
much
drier
form
this
beer
drinks
medium
in
body
and
has
an
assertive
dry
tartness
to
pair
with
the
slight
chardonnay
most
present
on
the
nose
and
subtly
present
in
the
flavor
profile
overall
this
is
a
nice
triple
if
im
spending
money
on
a
tripe
id
prefer
its
on
something
unique
like
this
its
an
intriguing
take
on
the
style
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
bitter
monk
by
anchoragegood
thing
because
i
love
both
beers
overall
very
enjoyable
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
their
other
beers
the
tide
and
its
takers
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
just
a
little
bit
of
haze
to
it
about
three
fingers
of
snow
white
foam
pile
on
top
of
the
beer
head
retention
is
pretty
good
but
lacing
is
definitely
spotty
the
nose
is
fantastic
dominated
by
notes
of
mango
pineapple
and
lemon
theres
an
underlying
earthy
brett
funk
and
a
touch
of
chardonnay
adds
another
layer
of
complexity
the
barrel
aging
is
a
little
bit
more
prominent
in
the
flavor
profile
especially
cold
the
boozy
white
wine
notes
overpower
the
beer
a
little
bit
the
citrusy
lemon
and
tropical
fruit
influences
are
still
present
but
definitely
take
a
back
seat
here
as
compared
to
the
aroma
the
brett
funk
is
also
probably
a
little
bit
stepped
up
here
its
still
tasty
but
doesnt
quite
deliver
on
the
promise
of
the
nose
the
body
is
nicely
dried
out
and
light
but
its
paired
with
a
carbonation
that
could
stand
to
have
just
a
little
more
zip
to
it
i
definitely
enjoyed
my
bottle
of
anchorages
the
tide
and
its
takers
but
i
think
with
a
little
bit
less
overt
barrel
character
it
would
be
something
really
special
o
tastes
just
as
advertised
and
a
good
advertisement
at
that
a
bretty
chardonnay
oakaged
belgian
tripel
not
my
favorite
of
the
four
anchorage
beers
ive
had
but
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
very
interesting
example
of
the
style
i
would
recommend
that
you
check
it
out
b
i
dont
want
to
see
anchorage
back
themselves
into
a
corner
with
all
these
triplefermented
white
wine
barrelaged
beers
except
these
beers
have
been
incredible
so
far
so
if
they
turn
into
a
jolly
pumpkin
type
brewer
variations
on
a
theme
then
hey
no
complaints
from
me
ive
recently
been
won
over
by
several
chardonnays
after
not
thinking
i
was
ever
going
to
acquire
the
taste
for
wine
so
this
is
a
real
treat
considering
big
beers
are
my
thing
and
the
tripel
is
among
my
favorite
styles
so
if
youre
a
beer
drinker
of
similar
mindset
youre
going
to
want
to
try
this
pronto
as
with
all
the
anchorage
stuff
wow
best
newcomer
of
the
last
several
years
i
think
overall
this
was
a
nice
beet
that
i
was
surprised
i
enjoyed
because
of
my
distaste
for
tripels
its
also
quite
tame
for
a
wild
ale
at
this
point
as
well
and
i
can
only
see
this
developing
nicely
over
time
chardonnay
barrels
are
the
forefront
right
now
which
is
perfect
for
my
tastes
as
i
enjoy
95
of
wine
barrel
aged
beers
wish
these
werent
so
pricey
but
the
quality
is
definitely
there
not
for
your
novice
beer
drinker
for
sure
one
of
the
few
id
go
into
the
trenches
with
eh
had
high
hopes
kinda
dashed
looks
ok
a
first
pour
clear
translucent
golden
two
finger
white
head
medium
white
bubbles
sadly
the
apperance
is
not
as
it
should
be
the
head
is
not
rocky
as
a
triples
should
be
very
light
citrus
phenolic
hint
some
remaining
belgian
esters
a
hint
of
funk
and
barn
but
just
a
hint
the
flavor
brings
the
party
initially
light
tart
and
funky
followed
by
a
lemon
lift
and
some
distinct
sweet
vanilla
oak
and
light
spice
the
marriage
between
the
oak
and
beer
is
the
best
part
of
this
ale
full
rounded
and
silky
feel
dry
oh
yes
very
dry
but
alas
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
it
was
a
great
journy
just
not
the
best
beer
came
highly
recommended
by
vinny
at
deciccos
in
brewster
ny
i
trust
vinny
not
only
because
he
looks
trustworthy
but
he
has
yet
to
steer
me
wrong
not
cheap
at
18
but
im
glad
i
took
it
on
looks
like
a
thick
hefe
on
the
pour
but
a
thinner
head
brett
plays
a
huge
part
on
the
nose
with
its
funk
and
citrus
first
sip
is
over
the
top
orange
rind
but
i
know
this
onell
be
a
chameleon
very
complex
great
carbonation
with
a
clean
astringent
bite
i
like
it
very
much
although
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
sweetness
batch
1
pours
a
murky
golden
color
with
a
mediumlarge
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
quite
lovely
tart
lemon
notes
with
light
floral
hops
and
oak
nice
belgian
yeast
with
some
definite
barnyard
funk
from
the
brett
a
bit
of
honey
and
white
wine
as
well
taste
is
initially
sweet
citrus
fruits
lemons
and
a
hint
of
orange
immediately
followed
by
some
tart
lemon
floral
hop
flavors
with
some
intense
french
oak
flavors
as
well
there
is
a
ton
of
brett
in
the
flavor
as
well
quite
complex
finishes
with
some
white
wine
wild
yeast
and
bitter
hop
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
but
i
just
wish
i
had
bought
another
bottle
what
they
did
with
the
brett
in
this
beer
is
just
fantastic
so
i
would
love
to
see
how
it
ages
crossing
my
fingers
i
find
more
overall
awesome
it
provided
a
refreshingly
tasty
option
to
wash
down
our
homemade
meal
would
drink
this
anytime
this
beer
is
great
because
it
does
the
same
thing
but
in
a
totally
different
way
its
perhaps
the
perfect
funk
beer
herbal
spicy
fruity
earthy
and
let
very
little
defines
itself
making
the
whole
greater
than
the
parts
this
is
no
different
but
its
done
very
differently
from
love
buzz
and
bittemonk
i
get
the
feeling
this
is
what
de
proef
initially
intended
on
with
its
wild
beers
though
this
works
like
high
art
taste
as
usual
hides
a
high
abv
thought
the
bretty
and
tart
notes
were
on
the
lower
side
for
an
anchorage
release
far
better
than
your
average
belgian
trippel
for
my
palate
but
the
price
point
on
these
are
always
going
to
be
somewhat
prohibitive
from
becoming
a
regular
part
of
any
lineup
i
get
a
little
bit
of
a
citrusy
tripel
at
first
and
then
the
mellow
chard
oak
comes
in
but
the
finish
is
quite
interesting
a
tingling
pepperyness
swirls
in
and
leaves
with
a
bit
of
dry
finish
this
is
definitely
a
different
take
on
the
tripel
that
i
quite
enjoyed
o
another
good
beer
from
anchorage
theres
a
signature
to
all
the
beers
ive
had
from
them
so
far
that
theyll
be
riding
to
the
hall
of
fame
for
sure
45
lets
face
it
after
the
first
three
marvelous
beers
gabes
released
we
all
know
that
his
next
offering
was
likely
to
be
pretty
special
and
the
tripel
does
not
disappoint
it
poured
a
lovely
gold
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
was
interesting
with
some
spicy
belgian
yeast
notes
intermingling
with
some
bright
crisp
citrus
elements
likely
from
the
sorachi
ace
hops
and
just
a
touch
of
brett
funk
most
of
the
same
flavors
were
there
on
the
palate
plus
a
touch
of
woodiness
from
the
aging
in
chardonnay
barrels
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
brett
funkiness
reappeared
significantly
on
the
finish
given
my
experience
with
gabes
previous
beers
i
expect
that
cellaring
will
greatly
increase
the
brett
character
so
if
you
dont
like
your
tripels
funky
drink
this
one
fresh
its
9
0
abv
and
30
ibus
and
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
ever
had
another
masterpiece
from
gabe
fletchers
brewhouse
very
tasty
beer
i
enjoyed
it
overall
rather
good
for
the
style
imho
its
a
sweeter
version
of
fin
du
monde
with
a
slightly
less
complex
bouquet
but
still
quite
enjoyable
overall
very
delicate
tripel
with
a
lot
of
fruit
subtleties
inviting
and
delicious
and
a
great
start
to
the
tasters
pack
overall
final
grade
4
00
an
a
watou
tripel
is
a
wellmade
belgianstyle
brew
that
is
easy
to
like
but
is
not
likely
to
amaze
the
flavour
profile
is
highly
enjoyable
but
not
very
complex
for
this
style
lacking
many
of
the
inviting
aromatic
notes
and
the
spicy
kick
i
tend
to
expect
from
this
sort
of
strong
ale
its
still
a
very
solid
effort
that
id
happily
drink
again
but
in
the
end
its
a
victim
of
strong
competition
its
just
not
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
over
the
years
worth
a
look
if
nothing
else
enjoy
o
such
a
solid
tripel
tastes
great
and
has
a
killer
mouthfeel
a
very
true
tripel
with
a
really
impactful
and
competent
flavour
wrapped
in
a
very
succinct
and
balanced
profile
very
satisfying
and
interesting
from
start
to
finish
with
little
surprises
it
makes
for
quite
an
enjoyable
sipper
and
is
certainly
got
the
balance
very
in
tune
with
where
it
is
aiming
personally
maybe
it
was
a
touch
sweet
with
the
candi
sugars
to
begin
but
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
in
any
case
very
lovely
this
brewery
is
on
point
with
their
beers
its
okay
taste
like
what
you
would
expect
a
normal
beer
to
taste
like
like
it
is
the
most
quintessential
beer
that
one
could
expect
aftertaste
is
a
bit
strong
ordinary
nothing
special
opaque
golden
body
with
white
head
and
yeasty
sediment
belgian
candy
sugar
clove
honey
light
malt
and
herbal
notes
remarkable
overall
a
really
good
belgian
tripel
nice
mix
of
zesty
fruit
esters
and
spicy
yeast
very
champagnelike
nice
aroma
average
appearance
not
much
flavor
nice
palate
this
was
part
of
a
st
bernard
mixed
pack
all
in
all
a
great
beer
i
must
explore
more
belgian
beer
in
the
future
overall
a
pretty
solid
straightforward
tripel
but
one
that
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
bottle
obtained
from
a
st
bernardus
mixed
6pack
poured
into
a
goblet
a
rich
burnished
golden
color
with
an
imposing
fluffy
white
head
classic
belgian
look
massive
banana
and
clove
aromas
along
with
another
note
consistent
with
spicy
slightly
woody
belgian
yeast
i
found
this
one
to
be
sweet
and
malty
for
a
tripel
with
notably
less
overt
alcohol
on
the
palate
than
one
often
gets
with
such
brews
malt
backbone
recalls
brown
sugar
a
little
butterscotch
and
lightly
burnt
pancakes
fruity
and
spicy
featuring
clove
and
cinnamon
phenols
coupled
with
assertive
banana
and
baked
pear
the
yeast
recalls
a
hefeweizen
impressively
hoppy
for
the
style
as
well
with
some
noble
hop
and
gooseberry
notes
showing
up
in
the
fairly
sweet
but
not
cloying
finish
highly
carbonated
but
quite
smooth
and
on
the
thick
side
of
the
belgian
ale
body
continuum
it
was
interesting
to
sample
a
tripel
that
was
largely
true
to
style
but
nevertheless
sweeter
and
less
boozy
than
the
iconic
examples
overall
a
good
tripel
though
it
lacks
a
bit
of
the
flavor
complexity
of
their
st
bernardus
tripel
this
one
is
a
bit
sweet
and
lacks
some
of
the
spice
still
if
you
try
one
youve
got
to
try
the
other
overall
another
excellent
tripel
from
st
bernardus
not
sure
what
exactly
the
difference
in
flavor
is
but
both
are
welcome
in
my
fridge
any
time
overall
very
good
solid
beer
would
be
a
great
introduction
to
what
a
tripel
should
be
or
at
least
what
the
template
for
a
good
tripel
would
be
worth
a
try
even
if
you
think
you
dont
like
tripels
will
repurchase
when
i
get
around
to
johns
market
again
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
tripel
if
i
was
going
to
drink
a
tripel
i
would
probably
want
this
one
or
allagash
curieux
but
i
still
have
the
st
bernardus
tripel
on
deck
to
try
next
this
watou
tripel
has
an
old
antiqueold
world
type
taste
to
it
that
i
do
not
get
in
tripel
karmeliet
or
la
fin
du
monde
i
like
that
taste
of
have
been
sitting
in
a
cellar
aging
for
a
century
so
that
is
a
bonus
tripels
are
not
my
favorite
style
as
generally
the
stronger
hop
presence
is
not
my
bag
for
context
i
like
sweet
beers
in
the
style
of
belgian
strong
dark
ales
bruins
dubbels
etc
overall
quite
good
the
standard
st
bernadus
tripel
is
certainly
superior
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
a
fine
tripel
with
different
dynamics
than
the
st
bernardus
tripel
no
hint
of
booze
this
drinks
like
a
monks
table
beer
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
a
bottle
of
this
well
made
authentic
belgian
beer
othis
is
a
fine
belgian
tripel
the
appearance
is
what
other
tripels
should
strive
for
and
the
mouthfeel
matches
the
flavor
nicely
it
has
that
subtlety
in
flavor
that
many
american
brewers
should
take
note
of
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
and
spice
shown
in
the
best
variants
of
this
style
its
bernardus
cousin
for
example
overall
a
really
good
tripel
with
quite
a
bit
going
on
i
really
love
the
number
of
nuances
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
this
is
a
really
interesting
as
well
as
refreshing
beer
to
drink
o
a
pretty
good
easy
drinking
tripel
no
alcohol
evident
flavor
overall
is
light
and
subtle
but
very
tasty
o
its
a
little
sweeter
than
id
normally
like
a
tripel
to
be
and
almost
feels
a
little
halfbaked
not
quite
as
complex
as
other
examples
of
the
style
and
not
quite
as
drinkable
still
more
than
worthy
of
a
drink
though
o
this
isnt
the
best
tripel
that
ive
had
but
its
certainly
enjoyable
pairs
well
with
a
cold
winter
night
overall
it
is
a
decent
tripel
not
the
best
i
had
but
neither
the
worst
pour
is
a
hazy

thick

has
loads
of

it

banana
notes
up

with
some

sweeter

zesty

and

very

gets
a

in

yellow
with
lots
of
big
fluffy
head
slight
hint
of
spice
on
the
aroma
with
minimal
fruit
pears
if
anything
dry
yeastyness
tastes
refreshing
but
was
expecting
more
flavor
this
has
a
hint
of
yeasty
spice
on
top
of
slightly
watered
down
honey
sweetness
very
dry
finish
with
high
carbonation
and
light
palate
a
decent
beer
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
quality
of
the
abt
12
o
this
beer
hides
its
alcohol
rather
well
but
the
high
amount
of
candi
sugar
is
what
causes
you
to
need
to
sip
it
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
a
decent
enough
beer
it
hides
its
alcohol
strength
fairly
well
with
its
flavor
characteristics
a
bit
harsh
with
the
bitterness
but
fair
enough
for
the
style

i
have
to
admit
that
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
st
bernard
on
this
one
though
overall
this
beer
is
slightly
thicker
with
the
sweetness
and
yeast
but
not
overpowering
like
some
in
this
class
very
nice
o
pretty
lackluster
compared
to
the
other
offerings
ive
had
i
would
say
it
could
be
just
a
bad
bottle
but
the
other
beers
from
the

were
perfectly
fine

this
one
smell
is
of

yeast

some

taste
is
of
the

with
a

this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
and
tasty
tripel
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
as
i
have
never
seen
it
around
in
stores
complements
sun
ra
and
his
arkestra
musics
download
live
at
montreaux
peace
out
d
and
o
fun
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
bright
flavor
that
has
good
depth
o
i
thought
this
was
only
ok
not
what
i
was
expecting
a
bit
too
light
and
not
typical
of
the
style
i
found
myself
a
bit
confused
drinking
it
i
picked
it
up
when
i
bought
the
gift
pack
with
the
glass
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
all
the
st
bernardus
offerings
definitely
a
solid
tripel
but
pales
in
comparison
to
the
regular
st
bs
tripel
overall
this
is
a
solid
tripel
its
well
balanced
complex
and
delicious
overall
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
st
bernardus
brews
as
of
yet
its
subtle
mouthfeel
and
light
fruit
taste
are
fantastic
its
well
balanced
and
not
over
carbonated
golden
color
two
finger
head
smells
of
spicy
yeast
grain
with
wonderful
banana
bread
toward
the
end
i
get
a
very
smooth
balanced
taste
with
some
spice
banana
bread
honey
and
earth
and
grains
at
the
back
mouthfeel
is
creamy
just
enough
pepperyprickly
punch
but
not
overwhelming
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
d
certainly
a
step
below
the
st
bernardus
tripel
in
my
opinion
a
little
easier
to
drink
but
the
flavor
lacks
a
certain
complexity
that
one
would
expect
from
a
strong
belgian
beer
o
this
beer
is
great
but
if
you
are
excepting
a
tripel
in
the
conventional
sense
of
the
style
you
wont
find
it
here
it
takes
all
my
favorite
flavors
from
a
belgian
quad
and
puts
it
in
a
light
package
highly
recommended
and
at
a
competitive
price
point
i
got
this
beer
for
around
3
50
compared
to
most
belgians
that
go
for
57
i
will
be
coming
back
to
this
very
soon
overall
a
nice
beer
but
there
are
many
better
ones
in
the
style
this
tripel
pours
out
as
yellow
color
with
a
decent
looking
white
head
on
it
the
smell
had
a
floral
and
earthy
mix
of
aromas
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
spice
hop
bitterness
and
a
slight
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
has
a
bit
of
a
stinging
feeling
overall
the
beer
isnt
a
bad
tripel
excellent
beer
i
will
use
this
for
cooking
and
pairings
really
didnt
expect
such
a
pleasant
surprise
medium
mouthfeel
that
has
just
a
little
of
the
alcohol
present
not
the
best
tripel
but
a
solid
offering
overall
overall
an
ok
tripel
low
points
are
too
much
alcohol
flavor
and
too
dry
of
a
finish
a
letdown
because
st
b
is
such
an
awesome
brewery
o
an
excellent
beer
great
for
any
tripel
or
sweet
honey
blonde
enthusiasts
d
i
rate
this
higher
than
the
st
bernardus
version
because
its
much
bigger
and
fuller
not
digging
this
one
at
all
definitely
not
a
very
good
triple
and
something
i
wouldnt
buy
again
mouthfeel
is
rich
the
spiciness
and
carbonation
tickle
the
tongue
goes
down
smooth
except
for
a
slight
alcohol
bite
drinkability
for
a
tripel
is
good
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
a
delicious
and
even
tripel
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
body
and
light
carbonation
easy
to
drink
with
a
7
5
abv
a
nice
beer
but
the
standard
st
bernardus
tripel
is
better
in
my
opinion
a
delicious
and
even
tripel
sweet
very
carbonated
up
front
tingling
the
tongue
hints
o
slight
alcohol
peppery
spice
lemon
zest
and
citrus
peel
creamy
full
body
with
sweet
alcohol
light
fruit
and
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
the
spicy
notes
are
more
prominent
than
the
sweet
fruit
ones
but
this
is
still
very
decently
balanced
and
becomes
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
overall
a
great
beer
but
thats
no
surprise
thats
all
these
monks
know
how
to
do
an
easy
enough
triple
to
put
back
the
sweetness
whether
sugar
or
alcohol
oriented
kept
very
much
in
check
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
has
a
nice
dry
complexion
not
bad
flavors
and
nothing
negative
lingering
around
the
mouth
despite
being
7
5
it
drinks
very
well
too
not
boozy
at
all
color
a
little
cloudy
bitter
orange
nose
quite
pronounced
a
mouth
spicy
without
being
too
much
we
feel
the
bitterness
which
undoubtedly
comes
from
citrus
character
conveyed
by
yeasts
the
finish
is
not
great
power
and
not
so
persistent
if
somewhat
syrupy
a
lack
of
body
and
flavor
for
a
beer
called
triple
a
well
put
together
tripel
just
too
dry
for
my
personal
liking
its
a
good
tripel
all
in
all
not
too
sweet
yeasty
and
tasty
it
isnt
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
its
definitely
drinkable
and
one
i
could
drink
again
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
two
finger
bubbly
off
white
head
on
a
clear
dark
gold
the
head
soon
diminishes
to
a
ring
no

to
speak
of
malty
smells
sweetish
fruity
notes
very
smooth
taste
nice
round
well
melded
flavours
caramel
in
the
back
no
apparent
carbonation
yet
it
seems
to
be
there
an
excellent
triple
only
the
high
abv
keeps
it
from
session
territory
as
there
are
no
impediments
elsewhere
d
a
solid
tripel
though
not
in
the
upper
echelon
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
however
i
would
prefer
a
different
tripel
if
i
had
the
choice
mouthfeeldrinkability
lightmedium
bodied
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
rather
chewy
for
the
style
but
not
a
negative
although
the
alcohol
isnt
hidden
its
fairly
tame
for
the
abv
making
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
still
dont
quite
understand
the
difference
between
st
bernardus
and
watou
but
have
to
say
i
prefer
the
later
well
worth
another
purchase
its
worth
a
try
the
dominant
floral
flavors
prevent
this
one
from
being
super
drinkable
id
love
to
have
another
but
i
wouldnt
want
it
right
away
i
want
something
else
to
give
my
taste
buds
a
change
of
pace
first
its
clear
with
a
pale
amber
hue
the
white
foamy
head
doesnt
stand
too
long
on
its
hind
legs
but
once
back
on
all
fours
it
lingers
on
seemingly
unendingly
kinda
reassuring
actually
some
variablelength
deposits
of
webbed
lacing
is
formed
evidence
of
the
fortitude
contained
in
this
glass
this
just
wouldnt
be
a
tripel
without
some
clove
and
banana
and
our
boy
doesnt
disappoint
in
fact
it
downright
appoints
insert
rim
shot
here
but
seriously
folks
the
banana
and
clove
are
there
in
abundance
joined
in
their
nasal
migration
by
some
coriander
orange
peel
and
pineapple
not
a
rare
combination
but
not
wholly
ordinary
either
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
then
that
the
taste
takes
these
elements
and
introduces
them
to
a
new
habitat
yes
there
is
a
risk
that
they
wont
get
along
so
well
in
their
newfound
captivity
but
so
far
they
seem
to
be
adapting
just
fine
in
fact
they
are
even
joined
by
a
warm
breadiness
and
a
rounded
tartness
not
only
are
they
interacting
with
no
problems
theyre
downright
getting
along
its
what
you
always
hope
for
when
you
get
involved
in
flavor
relocation
and
confinement
the
modd
is
light
but
not
too
light
some
necessary
seriousness
is
bound
to
find
its
way
in
but
thats
life
regardless
things
go
down
quite
smoothly
allowing
for
happiness
to
continuously
pervade
for
some
time
well
back
to
observation
you
gotta
love
a
brewery
that
makes
two
tripels
and
great
ones
at
that
this
one
pours
hazy
copper
with
a
big
layer
of
bubbles
nose
is
huge
banana
with
clove
juniper
pineapple
and
a
hint
of
caramelized
sweetness
flavor
is
quite
smooth
with
a
wellbalanced

banana
and
a
finish
of
anise
and
clove
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorites
tripels
drinkability
a
nice
solid
tasty
drinkable
if
not
exceptional
tripel
id
absolutely
have
this
again
d
st
bernardus
never
fails
to
deliver
a
great
brew
this
tripel
is
is
no
exception
nice
looking
orangey
color
on
it
with
a
billowy
white
head
cloudy
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonated
bubbles
great
thick
aroma
citrusy
and
belgian
sugary
with
a
touch
of
champagne
and
passion
fruits
taste
is
solid
if
unspectacular
but
still
superior
to
many
tripels
ive
had
very
light
taste
with
some
spices
present
just
an
allaround
good
beer
here
wonderful
flavor
creamy
mouthfeel
crisp
and
light
on
the
other
hand
booze
is
a
little
stronger
in
the
mouth
than
i
anticipated
overall
though
sweet

and
fruity
musty
excelent

poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
frothy
wellcarbd
head
that
dies
slowly
great

smell
along
with
belgian
funkyeast
and
hints
of
spices
and
sweet

like
caramel
a
great
fruit
taste
of
a
citricorange
variety
that
is
blended
with
sweet
malts
like
caramel
minor
spices
and
clove
a
medium
body
that
is
chewey
and
also
has
a
wellcarbd
feeling
but
not
bubbly
like
champagne
for
a
crisp
dry
finish
not
an
overpowering
or
somewhat
sour
tripel
more
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
a
quality
beer
all
the
way
i
like
this
beer
a
triple
on
the
side
of
a
fantastic
blonde
nose
is
very
intensely
taffy
bit
of
honey
pollen
with
a
body
and
feel
that
is
voluminously
bready
sweet
like
challah
bread
honey
suckle
floral
sweet
wonderful
esters
that
dessert
of
all
blondes
wonderful
carbonation
quite
sweet
which
i
could
see
would
deter
people
but
very
concealed
abv
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
really
drinkable
tripel
the
balance
of
flavors
is
quite
good
and
their
interplay
makes
sipping
this
one
an
interesting
experience
with
each
sip
i
most
certainly
will
have
more
of
this
one
and
expect
that
buying
more
will
be
a
regular
event
very
drinkable
in
every
sense
of
the
word
taste
is
overly
carbonated
fills
the
mouth
up
with
bubbles
on
a
single
sip
like
a
cola
does
the
lemony
zest
really
hits
the
sides
of
the
tongue
sweet
malt
and
candied
sugar
complement
but
that
darned
carbonation
is
way
too
assertive
the
strength
is
well
hidden
though

much

d
really
nice
would
definately
seek
more
great

really
complex
and
worth
having
another
d
a
very
nice
tripel
not
quite
up
to
snuff
with
the
st
bernardus
tripel
but
still
very
enjoyable
and
actually
fairly
easy
to
put
one
back
notes
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
tripel
i
liked
the
mellow
sweetness
that
slowly
dried
out
towards
the
finish
and
the
champagne
like
texture
and
grape
flavor
d
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
id
pick
this
over
the
regular
tripel

is
less

and
more

than
the
st

tripel
retention

is
lower
in
this
beer
smells
of
fruits
lots
of
apple
raisins
malts
and
some

tastes
of

apples
again
green
ones
yeast
raisins
and
alcohol
the
main
difference
between
this
one
and
the
standard

is
the
higher

in
this
beer
mouthfeel
is

alcohol
might
get
old
after
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
with
a
few
characteristics
that
strike
me
as
minor
flaws
it
is
a
gorgeous
beer
in
the
glass
its
flavor
and
aroma
profile
is
on
the
milder
side
the
only
issue
in
my
view
is
that
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
style
definitely
a
good
example
of
an
abbey
tripel
though
and
well
worth
seeking
out
not
sure
what
was
wrong
maybe
i
got
owned
on
the
specific
bottle
but
it
was
not
good
at
all

initial
with

in

palate
is
a
touch
heavy
but
overall
this
is
a
nice
tripel
with
easy
drinking
enjoyable
d
given
the
abv
for
a
tripel
this
is
more
than
drinkable
and
wuld
be
a
decent
introduction
to
the
style
i
think
ill
buy
it
again

ive
had
this
beer
on
many
occasions
now
and
however
much
i
love
the
tripel
style
it
has
never
managed
to
win
me
over
i
really
like
this
brewery
and
everything
about
the
beer
is
textbook
belgian
tripel
yet
i
wouldnt
place
it
in
the
same
league
as
the
westmalle
or
karmeliet
oh
well
st
bernardus
has
plenty
of
other
great
beers
to
stock
the
cellar
with
very
spritzy
carbonation
and
nice
aftertaste
very
drinkable
for
a
strong
ale
overall
a
fine
beer
tarnished
a
bit
by
all
the
appearance
of
yeast
chunks
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
how
complex
it
is
it
is
not
too
thick
or
to
light
and
has
so
much
going
on
in
the
smell
and
taste
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
beer
some
time
in
the
future
first
impression
is
that
this
is
highly
carbonated
almost
like
a
soda
pop
there
is
a
light
lemony
presence
to
an
otherwise
lightly
sweet
molasses
touch
the
aftertaste
is
toward
the
tart
side
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
pretty
much
spot
on
forr
the
style
definitely
up
there
with
the
best
in
the
category
and
not
one
you
see
around
quite
as
much
pours
a
hazy
orangegolden
with
a
very
finely
beaded
white
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
and
swirl
lovely
spice
aromas
of
clove
coriander
and
anise
with
a
background
breadiness
that
is
very
pleasant
beautifully
balanced
flavors
with
more
breadiness
white
pepper
clove
less
anise
and
a
bit
of
tannins
on
the
end
there
is
some
sweetness
from
candi
sugar
but
this
is
much
less
sweet
than
many
examples
and
the
spice
notes
are
foremost
some
light
banana
as
it
warms
a
little
stiffer
and
more
tannic
than
some
tripels
but
complex
and
full
in
the
mouth
delicious
a
serious
tripel
that
deserves
to
be
sipped
and
contemplated
just
figuring
out
the
changing
spice
notes
will
keep
you
busy
they
keep
eveolving
eventually
i
taste
ginger
and
mace
and

as
well
as

probably
the
best
tripel
ive
ever
had
worth
every
penny
a
must
try
for
craft
beer
lovers
and
probably
anybody
who
enjoys
trying
some
new
this
is
in
my
opinion
the
perfect
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
gold
hazy

with
plenty
of

very
nice
tripel
not
sure
worth
what
i
paid
at
my
local
beer
store
but
very
nice
indeed
great
but
only
at
the
right
price
think
i
paid
about
13
bucks
for
a
bottle
listed
at
1
pint
9
4
oz
not
too
different
from
a
good
pilsner
this
does
not
support
the
prestige
or
justify
value
final
thoughts
all
in
all
its
a
solid
tripel
part
of
me
likes
how
more
of
the
malt
and
grainy
aspects
come
forward
but
doesnt
abandoned
its
fruity
yeast
and
simplifies
part
of
me
sees
it
as
a
bit
tamer
then
expected
two
thumbs
up
still
despite
this
mainly
because
the
beer
still
has
it
pretty
all
together
o
a
delight
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
gem
hoppy
start
but
the
finish
is
smooth
o
a
sure
favorite
when
looking
for
fruity
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
this
final
grade

a
fantastic
a
st
bernardus
tripel
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
its
style
that
i
have
yet
tried
and
a
much
more
robust
satisfying
brew
than
their
watou
tripel
also
included
in
this
sampler
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
im
saddened
by
the
fact
that
i
probably
wont
be
able
to
procure
any
more
without
engaging
in
a
road
trip
or
border
crossing
positively
outstanding
and
quite
possibly
my
favourite
st
bernardus
beer
of
all
a
tantalizing
aroma
and
taste
profile
on
this
upfront
fruitiness
and
rustic
notes
yield
a
great
depth
of
yeasty
esters
and
malt
notes
the
aroma
i
found
to
a
bit
overwhelming
in
terms
of
overripe
fruit
initially
but
overall
i
have
to
say
this
was
a
superb
tripel
with
nice
balance
and
didnt
flaunt
its
strength
but
remains
a
keenly
drinkable
and
satisfying
trappist
ale
well
deserved
reputation
overall
ive
yet
to
find
a
st
bernardus
beer
that
i
dont
like
whilst
this
isnt
quite
in
the
same
league
as
say
the
abt
12
its
still
about
as
good
an
example
of
a
tripel
as
youll
find
definitely
worth
the
effort
o

pretty

looked

lingers
on

for
awhile
keeper
will
buy
more
an
unremarkable
tripel
which
does
not
stand
out
from
the
crowd
one
of
the
best
tripels
not
as
good
as
westmalle
though
mild
smell
and
taste
could
be
more
intensive
but
refreshing
overall
a
classic
tripel
that
is
right
near
the
top
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
in
fact
its
close
enough
that
id
probably
have
to
do
a
sidebyside
with
the
others
that
standout
in
my
mind
to
really
have
a
good
idea
on
which
was
my
favorite
sometimes
its
refreshing
to
know
that
such
an
welldone
beer
can
be
picked
up
on
the
shelf
of
about
any
liquor
store
you
could
walk
into
at
any
point
in
time
overall
great
zestypeppery
flavour
and
a
nice
mix
of
fruity
notes
this
is
world
class
stuff
for
sure
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
so
far
poured
a
bottle
obtained
from
a
st
bernardus
mixed
pack
i
wish
more
belgian
breweries
did
this
into
a
goblet
a
live
pour
although
dropping
the
bottle
on
the
floor
first
probably
didnt
help
matters
with
a
ton
of
white
froth
that
settled
out
to
a
more
reasonable
level
the
beer
itself
presents
as
a
cloudy
honey
yellow
with
an
aroma
of
shortbread
medicinal
honey
apples
pears
woodyspicy
belgian
yeast
a
plenty
the
taste
was
more
assertive
than
the
smell
with
an
unusual
and
interesting
butterscotch
chip
backbone
vanilla
brownie
some
grapelike
lager
character
tobacco
candied
citrus
rind
rosewater
a
sweetish
nuttiness
and
sour
green
fruit
all
revealing
themselves
in
a
bit
of
a
hodgepodge
resembles
its
stablemate
watou
tripel
in
being
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
although
this
one
does
have
more
heft
in
terms
of
both
aromatic
alcohol
presence
and
a
richer
malt
character
a
touch
thicker
than
other
tripels
and
less
fizzy
as
well
nevertheless
finishes
on
the
dry
side
despite
the
initial
sweetness
producing
a
tannic
puckering
effect
on
the
mouth
and
thrusting
some
woody
and
gooseberrylike
hops
out
there
near
the
end
i
like
to
compare
my
tasting
notes
to
those
of
micheal
jackson
whenever
possible
both
as
a
reality
check
and
a
form
of
hero
worship
in
great
beers
of
belgium
hes
got
this
one
down
as
vanilla
cookies
and
sesame
seeds
with
a
tangerinelike
finish
i
guess
i
did
alright
o
a
very
good
tripel
although
not
the
best
i
prefer
a
westmalle
or
rochefort
over
this
due
to
the
mouth
feel
but
thats
extremely
subjective
on
my
part
overall
a
good
example
of
a
tripel
very
drinkable
tripel
lot
of
flavor
and
a
mellow
8
percent
good
amt
of
citrus
grape
apple
flavors
lot
of
carbonation
and
mellow
spicy
yeast
notes
all
melded
together
perfectly
very
elegant
drink
not
a
very
harsh
tripel
at
all
while
still
being
complex
and
interesting
great
complex
tripel
quite
elegant
thats
how
a
tripel
should
taste
like
no
sharp
edges
as
most
tripels
even
though
i
did
leave
this
to
mature
for
quite
a
while
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
tripel
very
traditional
relatively
complex
extremely
smooth
one
of
the
better
versions
i
have
had
and
another
great
beer
from
this
brewery
on
tap
at
the
bull
and
bush
they
have
really
put
in
a
lot
of
guest
taps
recently
including
a
lot
of
higher
end
belgian
stuff
very
cool
this
is
one
of
the
classics
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
personal
favorites
because
of
its
relative
lack
of
sweetness
compared
to
its
peers
hazy
and
very
pale
straw
in
color
with
a
smaller
head
than
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
close
to
an
inch
of
lasting
white
airy
foam
it
smells
floral
from
the
yeast
like
little
white
and
purple
meadow
flowers
and
a
rather
high
dose
of
oats
along
with
the
wheat
and
barley
in
the
grain
bill
lots
of
body
and
just
a
touch
of
residual
sugar
long
grainy
start
turns
into
a
dry
yeasty
finish
classic
belgian
yeast
fruit
esters
pop
all
over
the
place
and
prickly
carbonation
makes
8
abv
feel
dangerously
light
its
a
classic
recipe
a
classic
yeast
strain
and
a
real
artisan
product
that
is
rooted
in
tradition
and
timeless
in
flavor
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
because
of
its
dryness
it
doesnt
sacrifice
any
body
to
get
there
either
light
fruitiness
is
left
on
the
tongue
after
the
swallow
and
a
750ml
of
this
would
not
be
too
much
for
me
in
a
sitting
rich
and
succulent
must
try
o
probably
my
favorite
tripel
thus
far
im
finding
that
i
prefer
dubbels
and
quads
but
this
one
is
right
up
there
highly
recommend
consumed
at
cellar
temp
about
15
minutes
sitting
at
room
temp
before
opening
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
all
the
way
through
despite
the
high
abv
it
remains
mellow
and
balanced
which
makes
for
a
very
good
experience
no
wonder
this
is
one
of
the
best
rated
tripels
out
there
ooverall
a
great
tripel
hides
the
abv
well
a
must
try
more
bitter
than
expected
the
estery
profile
is
very
complex
and
the
peppery
finish
is
nice
but
it
tends
to
overwhelm
tripels
are
not
my
favorite
style
at
all
i
prefer
dubbels
and
quads
but
occasionally
i
do
like
to
try
styles
i
dont
ordinarily
seek
out
im
very
glad
i
tried
this
one
i
should
probably
do
a
sidebyside
with
westmalle
and
la
fin
du
monde
two
other
tripels
i
think
very
highly
of
overall
a
great
tripel
bright
glowing
honeygold
color
surprisingly
small
white
head
fades
quickly
to
barely
anything
not
all
the
yeast
is
poured
in
but
some
discernible
tiny
suspended
chunks
are
visible
aroma
is
phenolic
with
clove
flowery
bubblegummy
and
fruity
with
orange
lemon
cherry
and
apple
cider
sweet
drippy
maltiness
bready
toffee
and
butterscotchlike
nice
and
soft
yet
certainly
substantial
flavors
are
sugar
cookie
dough
peppery
spice
lemon
floral
alcohol
and
light
candied
caramel
nice
slick
semisyrupyviscous
softly
coating
texture
body
is
a
full
frothy
medium
a
heavy
kind
of
medium
very
fine
softly
fizzy
carbonation
and
well
disguised
bitterness
and
dryness
elongated
throughout
the
finish
overall
just
a
great
tripel
stands
with
the
best
of
them
but
does
quite
enough
to
stand
out
from
the
rest
of
them
from
there
its
just
a
matter
of
taste
oa
world
class
brew
for
me
st
bernardus
tripel
is
an
acquired
taste
but
that
doesnt
deter
from
its
greatness
too
clean
and
medicinal
on
the
smell
and
taste
like
my
glass
had
the
residue
of
dish
washing
liquid
in
it
or
something
but
the
yeast
is
a
treat
it
gives
the
beer
a
beautiful
look
unique
taste
and
produces
super
foam
to
swish
around
leaving
you
enjoying
every
last
bubble
every
last
drop
belgium
is
the
mecca
of
beer
o
not
their
best
beer
but
certainly
not
their
worst
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
very
tasty
me
impressionei
com
essa
tripel
eu
estava
esperando
menos
e
encontrei
um
grande
cerveja
seu
excessivo
amargor
me
agradou
e
eu
gostei
de
sua
rusticidade
acredito
que
ela
seja
uma
respeitável
tripel
que
agrega
muito
valor
para
a
cervejaria
st
bernardus
one
that
i
quite
enjoyed
and
one
that
despite
the
strength
went
down
quite
easily
thanks
to
the
good
balance
between
fruits
and
the
lively
carbonation
i
was
expecting
the
beer
to
be
a
good
one
and
it
didnt
disappoint
and
despite
the
fact
the
finish
was
a
dry
one
odone
of
the
better
tripels
i
have
tried
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
its
a
classic
for
those
who
lose
the
style
the
depth
of
the
beers
maltiness
was
by
far
the
biggest
takeaway
for
me
o
this
brew
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
by
the
end
i
am
a
believer
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
goblet
thick
white
foamy
head
that
faded
slowly
into
a
thick
white
top
and
sticky
lacing
over
a
cloudy
orangish
liquid
with
noticeable
yeasties
settling
to
the
bottom
smells
like
a
triple
should
with
nothing
in
particular
standing
out
yeast
esterstropical
fruit
and
perfectly
balanced
hops
and
malt
tastes
like
banana
kiwi
citrus
slightly
more
bitter
than
sweet
which
is
good
slightly
spicy
its
soft
and
fuzzy
like
a
delicious
pillow
in
your
mouth
which
is
also
a
good
thing
better
than
some
trapist
triples
overall
a
fantastic
beverage
from
a
fantastic
brewery
o
overall
this
was
dog
gone
good
an
excellent
example
of
a
tripel
but
it
was
quite
pricey
ogreat
tripel
great
depth
of
flavor
one
of
the
best
overall
amazing
easily
one
of
my
top
beers
750ml
12
99
o
disappointing
but
by
no
means
bad
st
bernardus
tripel
is
just
a
lackluster
beer
swimming
in
a
sea
of
other
aromatic
vibrant
and
elegant
tripels
all
chock
full
of
character
and
life
this
beer
seems
faded
and
boring
by
comparison
though
mainly
in
flavor
this
tripel
is
really
fantastic
its
fruity
light
and
highly
drinkable
o
one
spicy
tripel
one
of
the
spiciest
ive
had
lots
of
great
belgian
yeast
flavors
in
this
one
well
balanced
flavors
crisp
and
easy
drinking
great
brew
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
tripel
it
is
not
as
complex
or
bold
enough
for
my
taste
but
i
would
drink
it
again
prost
o
this
was
a
great
beer
looking
forward
to
the
next
one
well
balanced
especially
for
8
alcohol
any
alcoholic
nose
is
absent
with
only
a
slight
aftertaste
of
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
a
touch
of
spice
nice
mouthfeel
and
head
retention
balance
is
the
keyword
for
this
beer
no
noticeable
flaws
or
otherwise
outstanding
positive
characteristics
very
drinkable
o
good
but
not
great
in
my
opinion
certainly
worthy
of
a
try
but
there
are
several
tripels
i
enjoy
more
than
this
one
this
beer
is
good
and
i
would
get
it
again
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
little
bit
better
after
trying
the
quad
of
the
same
brand
that
beer
is
definitely
superior
a
fine
fine
tripel
but
i
think
it
misses
the
depth
and
complexity
of
its
sister
the
watou
tripel
i
just
find
that
one
much
more
interesting
but
this
one
is
much
more
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
more
of
this
maybe
too
much
too
easily
this
is
by
far
the
easiest
drinking
tripel
i
have
had
the
flavor
is
great
but
not
overly
complex
i
would
like
this
in
a
750
ml
because
it
just
opened
up
as
i
finished
it
overall
awesome
beer
from
belgium
very
fullbodied
and
yet
quite
refreshing
i
want
another
growler
this
tripel
is
one
of
the
best
it
is
outstanding
in
every
way
and
it
is
everything
you
expect
in
the
style
chalky
yeast
and
and
a
deep
but
light
fruit
character
delicate
toasted
malt
and
a
little
pin
prick
of
hop
bitter
its
whimsical
and
yet
tall
and
upright
you
can
almost
imagine
that
the
jolly
looking
monk
on
the
bottle
is
the
real
genius
behind
this
beer
its
as
if
he
is
saying
our
backs
are
straight
but
we
do
know
how
to
have
a
little
fun
when
no
one
is
looking
indulgent
and
very
very
good
mf
fizzy
effervescent
a
dry
finish
and
medium
light
body
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
beer
it
might
not
be
my
favorite
triple
but
it
is
still
a
very
solid
offering
this
was
quite
pleasant
not
too
sweet
like
so
many
tripels
the
dryness
in
the
finish
i
was
also
fond
of
o
another
fine
belgian
taste
treat
dunno
if
i
would
pay
the
price
for
this
again
but
it
was
great
to
try
looking
forward
to
prior
8
and
abt
12
this
is
good
and
better
than
that
but
it
is
not
life
changing
or
close
to
a
wow
beer
very
good
but
a
little
disappointing
compared
to
this
brewerys
other
beers
very
nice
abt
12
was
better
but
this
was
enjoyable
and
tasty
o
great
beer
yes
world
class
beer
ehhh
maybe
i
can
tell
a
lot
of
work
went
into
making
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
everything
about
this
beer
other
than
the
aftertaste
overall
a
pretty
impressive
but
ultimately
far
too
expensive
belgian
tripel
i
do
prefer
the
tripels
from
the
little
brewing
co
mad
abbot
or
st
feuillien
both
of
which
come
in
at
a
minimum
of
20
cheaper
than
the
case
price
of
over
au125
2013
everything
about
this
beer
is
mellow
and
relaxing
the
taste
us
a
pleasant
combination
of
pale
malts
belgian
sugars
and
low
bitterness
not
as
citrusy
and
tart
as
other
tripels
i
have
tried
i
enjoyed
this
brew
o
this
blew
me
away
from
the
moment
i
opened
the
lid
superb
example
of
a
tripel
world
class
o
very
very
impressive
definitely
up
in
my
favourite
tripels
loving
the
complexity
that
goes
into
this
beer
without
completely
warping
it
away
from
the
classic
tripel
feel
o
as
expected
this
is
a
great
triple
super
complex
profile
while
being
well
balanced
as
well
overall
impression
a
delicious
and
easy
drinking
tripel
much
easier
to
drink
than
westmalle
tripel
and
exhibits
the
spicey
hops
and
yeast
desired
with
strong
malt
background
o
not
as
great
as
i
remember
but
having
bought
this
bottle
in
korea
i
imagine
its
three
months
on
a
container
ship
might
have
taken
its
toll
o
this
beer
looks
good
smells
better
and
tastes
amazing
the
further
you
go
into
experiencing
this
beer
the
better
it
gets
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
and
so
easily
available
o
a
great
tripel
a
touch
of
fruity
sweetness
with
a
complex
spice
to
balance
fairly
dry
throughout
no
alcohol
flavor
whatsoever
o
a
phenomenal
beer
and
a
hallmark
of
the
style
great
flavors
and
pretty
much
all
around
perfect
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
i
have
ever
tried
there
is
nothing
brazen
within
each
taste
just
a
rich
myriad
of
complex
flavors
that
attach
to
your
palette
and
then
to
your
mind
this
beer
goes
great
with
aged
cured
dried
meats
with
red
grapes
fig
jam
and
aged
brie
o
sweet
fruity
and
very
candylike
so
easy
to
drink
to
be
sure
this
was
a
strong
beer
and
it
as
light
as
the
mouthfeel
was
the
alcohol
was
easily
detected
from
start
to
finish
combined
with
the
candy
sugar
it
made
this
just
a
bit
stronger
and
more
intense
than
i
would
have
liked
but
this
was
still
a
sold
beer
that
had
a
lot
going
for
it
not
the
best
example
of
a
tripel
but
not
to
be
missed
either
if
the
time
allots
for
the
booze
to
settle
in
since
the
lightness
and
flavors
more
than
make
up
for
the
intensity
serving
type
bottle
to
the
point
a
very
nice
tripel
ill
take
piraat
over
this
all
day
a
full
3
fingered
white
head
with
large
bubbles
looks
like
cloudy
apple
cider
or
mango
smell
fresh
cut
apples
and
grape
juice
generally
fruity
flavor
but
apples
is
most
prevalent
slightly
bitter
and
a
little
dry
has
the
feel
of
a
sparkling
wine
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
excellent
balance
and
blend
a
great
tripel
ime
very
glad
i
found
this
to
try
o
elegant
and
very
wellproduced
but
also
somewhat
anonymous
in
that
no
flavors
or
aromas
truly
emerge
as
dominant
for
some
thats
going
to
be
why
this
is
the
best
tripel
out
there
i
like
mine
more
aggressive
so
westmalle
is
my
trappist
triple
of
choice
this
beer
is
just
so
easy
to
drink
smooth
hardly
a
hint
of
alchohol
hint
of
flowers
citrus
medium
mouth
superb
easy
drinker
that
stands
up
to
just
about
anything
in
this
style
it
may
not
be
quite
as
great
as
the
quad
but
its
still
a
beer
i
could
happily
drink
if
i
could
only
have
one
choice
for
the
rest
of
my
life
love
it
awesome
example
of
the
style
just
an
all
around
beautiful
tripel
o
world
class
my
favorite
tripel
o
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
tripels
in
the
world
crazy
drinkable
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
st
b
chalice
noticed
sediment
at
end
of
pour
and
left
dregs
in
the
bottle
brilliant
gold
colored
body
with
a
cloudlike
pillow
for
a
head
bottle
was
aged
for
a
year
and
there
was
still
plenty
of
carbonation
smell
was
yeasty
and
musty
but
in
a
good
way
taste
was
crisp
for
the
style
and
not
as
sweet
as
other
tripels
i
have
tried
mouthfeel
goes
along
with
this
very
crisp
and
dry
the
abv
was
well
hidden
a
classic
example
of
the
style
these
monks
really
know
what
they
are
doing
with
this
beer
othere
are
better
tripels
and
there
are
worse
tripels
but
if
i
had
to
describe
all
of
the
characteristics
that
make
a
tripel
a
tripel
this
would
be
a
good
brew
to
use
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
sugary
yeast
flavors
and
more
herbal
grassy
flavors
that
keep
this
beer
drinkable
feel
as
usual
for
a
true
belgian
is
great
this
is
another
great
example
from
st
bernardus
and
beers
like
this
will
leave
me
ordering
a
triel
the
next
time
we
go
out
speaking
of
that
i
had
a
dry
hopped
tripel
last
night
it
was
from
new
belgium
and
was
served
on
cask
it
was
at
flannys
a
bar
that
i
hate
last
night
we
had
an
equally
horrible
experience
as
we
did
the
first
time
we
went
good
thing
the
beer
was
delicious
i
also
had
a
smoked
ipa
on
cask
yummy
pretty
good
tripel
and
it
would
be
a
great
tripel
if
it
wasnt
for
that
strange
moldy
flavor
i
was
getting
at
first
good
think
it
eventually
recessed
and
went
away
the
second
half
was
wonderful
if
only
the
entire
timeline
went
that
way
overall
still
very
good
o
a
classic
example
of
the
style
and
great
balance
of
spicy
yeasty
sweet
goodness
o
an
amazing
tripel
just
so
tasty
and
complex
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
tripel
and
one
that
is
a
great
pleasure
to
drink
ill
have
to
pick
this
one
up
again
excellent
tripel
rich
pale
malts
with
a
tasty
yeast
strain
stone
fruit
with
some
spice
on
the
back
end
very
drinkable
i
found
myself
drinking
this
faster
than
most
tripels
st
berny
makes
a
quality
tripel
no
suprise
there
makes
me
want
to
go
back
and
get
the
watou
tripel
final
thoughts
i
tend
to
file
tripels
under
my
list
of
least
favorite
styles
that
does
not
however
stop
me
from
being
able
to
enjoy
true
brewing
prowess
when
i
encounter
it
id
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
belgian
ales
as
they
dont
know
what
theyre
missing
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
as
an
aperitif
overall
7
45
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellowgold
with
a
medium
white
head
compared
to
the
westmalle
the
smell
is
much
more
yeast
and
bananaforward
and
a
bit
sweeter
where
the
westmalle
has
a
little
more
going
on
flavor
is
typical
tripel
flavors
but
is
a
much
easier
drink
than
the
westmalle
its
not
nearly
as
earthy
bitter
or
boozy
and
stays
nice
light
and
fruity
mouthfeel
is
interestingly
creamy
and
really
nice
overall
this
is
a
great
perfectlybalanced
refreshing
tripel
there
isnt
as
much
depth
in
flavor
as
the
westmalle
but
i
find
it
to
be
a
more
enjoyable
drinking
experience
the
taste
is
dry
with
some
mild
yeast
accompaniment
and
both
spice
and
light
fruit
essence
are
noticeable
in
the
taste
with
a
mild
creaminess
from
the
malt
and
semihigh
carbonation
leaves
a
mild
mineral
taste
w
mild
herbal
hops
which
are
experienced
as
the
ale
finishes
with
dryness
on
the
palate
and
low
alcohol
impact
on
the
taste
in
general
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
as
it
develops
increasing
in
temperature
the
spice
character
and
hops
seem
to
emerge
with
a
a
very
flavorful
quality
and
well
rounded
taste
in
general
with
strength
matching
the
feel
this
is
what
i
consider
a
total
package
beerwonderful
and
a
high
value
as
well
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
my
favorite
tripel
i
love
this
beer
and
i
love
this
brewery
i
must
try
for
fans
of
the
style
o
really
good
tripel
with
a
very
sweet
flavor
the
feel
is
excellent
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
im
not
sure
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
beer
i
love
tripels
and
this
is
a
classic
for
the
style
very
enjoyable
theres
a
good
bit
of
alcohol
here
but
that
seems
almost
part
of
what
makes
this
style
and
without
it
id
be
disappointed
easily
the
best
triple
that
doesnt
change
the
traditional
formula
ive
had
taste
i
cant
taste
it
yet
i
continue
to
admire
the
beauty
in
the
duvel
tulip
glass
yeah
i
know
it
doesnt
even
lace
as
i
tilt
the
glass
it
bounds
fluidly
side
to
side
that
is
nice
i
can
never
express
my
tastes
in
the
types
of
malts
used
etc
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
this
is
sweet
and
it
is
sweet
too
but
its
got
a
nice
full
rounded
taste
not
too
heavy
not
too
fruity
as
belgiums
can
sometimes
go
and
the
head
continues
still
on
top
i
must
say
with
this
experience
right
now
this
has
to
be
my
current
all
time
favorite
brew
this
is
exciting
ive
heard
this
is
comparable
and
supposedly
earlier
brewed
by
the
same
to
the
westvleteren
which
i
balked
at
and
missed
out
on
well
at
least
the
8
the
brick
had
the
11
right
i
had
considered
the
chimay
blue
one
of
my
favorites
and
for
commerciality
duvel
is
a
stand
out
but
although
ive
had
this
before
my
taste
buds
are
literally
screaming
right
now
glad
i
got
the
big
bottle
i
understand
5s
should
be
rare
but
today
right
now
this
is
a
straight
across
the
board
5
something
the
hobbits
would
brew
this
was
a
very
good
tripel
all
around
very
nice
flavor
and
the
alcohol
was
almost
undetectable
overall
a
really
great
belgian
tripel
it
has
everything
you
look
for
in
the
style
fruits
spices
and
a
balanced
bitterness
o
strong
brew
very
fruity
and
on
the
sweet
side
complex
rich
palate
and
nose
i
loved
it
it
might
be
a
bit
dry
and
choppy
for
my
taste
but
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
triple
i
would
definitely
consider
picking
this
up
again
o
this
is
an
incredible
example
of
a
triple
the
champagne
style
scent
flavour
and
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
easy
to
drink
and
never
reveals
the
8
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
manages
to
hold
nicely
on
the
palette
leaving
a
clean
crisp
tartness
with
a
hint
of
yeastiness
terrific
drink
overall
4
0
this
was
a
very
intriguing
triple
i
enjoyed
this
beer
at
approximately
50
degrees
fahrenheit
which
brought
out
many
many
flavors
that
i
was
not
expecting
actually
as
the
beer
warmed
up
tastes
that
i
initially
perceived
as
adjuncts
particularly
in
the
finish
changed
and
became
more
obviously
simply
a
lighter
malt
sweetness
you
may
want
to
try
this
if
you
have
the
chance
to
taste
this
very
good
triple
o
a
decent
beer
the
grainy
character
if
this
brew
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
beer
with
some
bready
and
floral
yeast
and
some
light
hints
if
citrus
and
apples
overall
a
rather
delicious
triple
it
had
a
little
more
boozy
flavors
then
would
have
been
expected
for
its
8
abv
strength
and
its
nose
was
a
little
weak
but
overall
it
had
great
flavors
a
nice
look
and
a
wonderful
feel
o
very
refreshing
and
complex
it
has
a
nice
burnt
wheat
character
that
i
fully
enjoy
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
to
lighter
level
of
carbonation
overall
not
bad
but
not
a
tripel
i
would
drop
my
pants
and
run
to
have
again
worth
a
try
if
you
never
had
it
before
but
this
one
was
a
little
underwelming
for
me
while
it
offered
some
nice
complexity
it
just
was
ok
o
overall
it
reminded
me
of
a
more
alcoholic
la
fin
du
monde
probably
the
only
beer
ive
have
from
these
guys
that
wasnt
a
disappointment
pours
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
thick
white
longretaining
head
that
leaves
lace
aroma
is
classic
spicy
belgian
yeast
with
clove
banana
and
some
orange
standing
out
its
not
quite
as
aromatic
as
some
other
examples
however
taste
is
sweet
and
meaty
with
no
bitterness
a
grainy
flavor
makes
itself
apparent
after
it
warms
a
bit
body
is
full
mouthfeel
creamy
a
really
nice
tripel
o
this
is
a
good
brew
that
is
worth
having
on
occasion
but
i
do
not
understand
how
it
has
gathered
quite
so
much
hype
o
awesome
brew
i
picture
myself
drinking
this
at
a
farm
on
a
summer
day
theres
so
many
farmhouse
like
flavors
grains
hay
apricots
citrus
fruits
and
refreshing
pils
malts
on
top
of
that
your
given
awesome
caramel
toffee
and
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
try
this
oreally
hard
to
find
faults
in
st
bernardus
always
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
fantastic
beer
i
must
come
clean
up
front
i
love
st
bernardus
beers
and
shockingly
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
is
darn
near
as
good
as
draft
in
bruge
i
purchased
a
4
pack
at
total
wine
glad
to
see
they
are
beginning
to
carry
good
variety
of
bottled
4
packs
of
belgians
and
this
tripel
is
excellent
the
pour
is
delightful
not
overly
carbonated
really
an
almost
perfect
head
the
golden
haze
is
classic
for
a
really
good
tripel
the
initial
taste
is
neither
sweet
nor
too
dry
just
right
without
the
lemony
aftertaste
of
most
belgian
blondes
which
have
their
own
category
the
smell
is
as
good
as
it
gets
for
tripels
great
balance
hint
of
bananacaramel
but
really
a
clean
and
fine
flavorful
beer
and
the
moderate
alcohol
makes
this
tripel
worth
a
try
i
plan
to
enjoy
this
particular
brew
many
times
in
the
future
especially
now
that
i
dont
have
to
buy
the
22
oz
expensive
model
every
time
i
am
occasionally
torn
about
the
overall
price
of
belgian
beer
and
i
will
be
glad
when
our
stateside
brewers
catch
up
which
they
will
unfortunately
we
are
a
bit
short
on
monks
supplying
out
of
the
back
monastery
entrance
but
our
micros
more
than
hold
their
own
the
st
bernardus
range
of
beers
is
wonderfully
thought
out
and
each
has
a
reason
taste
and
character
for
its
existence
so
i
am
happy
to
include
this
with
their
abt
1286
and
wit
very
nice
belgian
triple
i
got
this
bottle
at
bevmo
in
ventura
california
it
comes
in
330ml
bottle
the
foam
was
creamy
and
reach
but
lasted
not
so
long
this
beer
has
most
of
attributes
of
belgian
triples
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
belgium
triples
pretty
good
tripel
from
this
brewery
though
i
enjoyed
their
dubbel
more
this
one
was
very
well
balanced
will
probably
buy
again
bottle
dark
gold
with
a
very
slight
haze
aroma
has
notes
of
malt
wheat
yeast
and
dried
fruits
very
smooth
creamy
and
somewhat
foamy
palate
flavor
has
soapy
citrus
peppery
spices
some
orange
peel
coriander
and
floral
notes
soft
body
the
alcohol
makes
a
statement
early
but
the
brew
turns
sweet
almost
cloying
before
spice
and
peachy
fruit
finish
very
nice
but
not
quite
at
the
level
of
some
of
my
other
favorite
tripels
i
definitely
appreciate
how
perfectly
balanced
and
well
crafted
this
is
though
for
sure
a
very
very
nice
beer
overall
admittedly
this
isnt
one
of
the
best
styles
for
me
but
a
very
well
made
beer
i
drank
the
whole
thing
which
is
saying
a
lot
for
this
guy
pours
hazy
golden
with
monster
creamy
white
head
smells
of
belgian
spices
some
light
fruits
and
a
bit
of
dry
yeast
taste
is
light
fruits
like
pears
and
apples
along
with
some
spiciness
and
funky
dry
yeast
good
beer
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
watou
version
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruits
honey
and
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
slight
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
it
easy
to
drink
o
good
but
not
exciting
me
that
much
the
bitterness
seems
a
little
out
of
balance
and
detracts
for
me
o
world
class
the
appearance
and
taste
of
this
tripel
are
phenomenal
light
and
refreshing
all
the
flavors
shine
without
stepping
on
each
others
toes
the
spice
of
the
yeast
is
showcased
especially
well
reminding
me
of
what
most
wits
should
scale
back
to
im
especially
impressed
with
how
theyve
handled
the
belgian
malt
as
its
a
delicate
animal
that
tends
to
leave
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
of
not
used
properly
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
tripels
out
there
rjt
o
a
good
tripel
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
the
way
i
was
by
their
abt
12
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
guys
know
what
theyre
doing
when
theyre
brewing
overall
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
from
one
of
the
staple
belgian
brewers
in
the
world
not
my
favorite
style
but
pretty
much
what
i
would
want
from
a
tripel
if
i
was
ever
in
the
mood
to
drink
one
not
to
the
quality
of
westmalle
but
close
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
good
place
to
start
your
craft
beer
exploration
if
it
is
just
beginning
overall
i
just
love
this
beer
its
somehow
hard
to
really
pinpoint
the
flavors
there
is
so
much
going
on
and
yet
its
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
its
a
mystery
to
me
making
this
beer
very
interesting
when
focused
on
it
and
very
very
drinkable
when
just
relaxing
and
having
a
beer
highly
recommended
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
dark
amber
accents
and
a
two
finger
bright
white
pillowy
head
abundant
lacing
as
the
head
recedes
incredible
head
retention
an
amazing
aroma
of
spices
belgian
yeast
and
ripe
fruit
on
the
nose
opens
with
herbs
and
flora
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
juicy
fruit
in
the
middle
and
finishes
dry
with
some
sweetness
extremely
mild
herbal
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
mindblowing
slightly
heavy
bodied
however
slick
with
abundant
velvetlike
creaminess
a
very
uniquely
amazing
tripel
and
a
brew
everyone
should
seek
out
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
coats
the
mouth
a
little
without
being
sticky
slightly
bitter
near
the
end
it
finishes
dry
makes
you
want
another
sip
recently
bought
a
four
pack
of
11
5
ounce
bottles
poured
into
a
trumpet
glass
very
generous
head
with
lacing
and
an
abundant
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
fresh
carbonation
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
i
find
this
a
great
example
of
a
tripel
i
would
recommend
this

for

the

is
really
on

nicely
a

than

an

classic

from

o
i
really
like
this

i
wish
i
had
a
fresher
one
to
compare
but
being
in

you
cant
find
this
within

would
gladly
have
again
and
then
again
i
can
see
why
its
rated
so
highly
on
the
list
overall
one
of
the
more
complex
tripels
ive
had
and
by

the

goes
down

ive
ever

amazing
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
cloudy
dull

with
a
large
white
head
that
dissipates
moderately
slowly
some
bubbles
can
be
seen
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
apples
banana
and
citrus
the
alcohol
is
hidden
in
the
aroma
the
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
and
i
do
detect
bready
malt
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
bready
malt
banana
apples
and
citrus
the
beer
is
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
theres
a
mild
spiciness
in
the
background
the
alcohol
isnt
detectable
at
all
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
plentiful
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
excellent
wellbalanced
tripel
overall
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
tripels
but
this
is
hands
down
the
best
that
ive
had
do
an
enjoyable
beer
particularly
in
the
warmth
of
a
summer
evening
would
have
again
this
manages
to
be
a
belgian
tripel
without
going
overboard
on
the
yeast
it
is
fruity
and
sweet
but
without
being
a
burden
to
drink
more
of
this
style
should
be
like
this
overall
good
flavor
aggressive
yeast
it
becomes
too
much
despite
that
its
a
solid
take
on
the
style
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
had
as
i
grow
more
of
a
taste
for
belgians
i
begin
to
realize
that
the
tripel
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
ill
definitely
come
back
to
this
beer
sooner
rather
than
later
overall
good
representation
of
the
style
it
doesnt
quite
take
the
place
of
chimay
in
my
heart
but
it
is
still
a
fine
ale
taste
shows
plenty
of
belgian
yeast
character
with
a
soft
grainy
malt
maybe
a
touch
overcarbonated
but
that
is
a
mild
complaint
nice
alcohol
bite
and
more
than
enough
hop
bitterness
a
surprising
amount
actually
i
cant
believe
it
took
this
long
for
me
to
buy
this
one
o
delicious
tripel

of
the

very

overall
this
is
exactly
like
a
belgium
trippel
should
taste
and
smell
not
what
you
expect
and
then
some
if
that
makes
sense
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
complex
delicious
and
true
to
the
style
mouthfeel
is
sublime
the
carbonation
folds
out
beautifully
and
leaves
a
nice
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
a
dryness
despite
the
creamy
feel
of
the
initial
sip
my
first
tripel
was
tripel
karmeliet
and
that
kind
of
turned
me
off
to
the
style
as
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
phenolic
spicy
qualities
ive
since
tried
a
few
other
examples
and
st
bernardus
has
been
the
mildest
in
terms
of
these
notes
which
i
appreciate
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
best
versions
of
a
tripel
i
believe
ive
tasted
and
this
brewery
consistently
brings
it
awesome
stuff
pours
a
hazy
yellow
gold
color
with
a
two
finger
head
which
recedes
to
skim
there
is
visible
floatees
in
the
beer
and
the
beer
leaves
sticky
fingers
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
bananas
lemon
grass
candied
yeast
and
pears
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
citrus
notes
up
front
before
a
candied
yeast
flavor
takes
over
the
beer
finishes
with
a
lemongrass
pear
and
banana
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
a
very
solid
beer
a
nice
aroma
and
look
to
pull
you
in
and
a
great
taste
to
keep
you
wanting
more
o
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
you
can
definitely
detect
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
i
like
the
light
fruit
sweetness
combined
with
the
banana
definitely
more
of
a
sipping
beer
than
a
session
beer
overall
a
fantastic
tripel
more
on
the
sweet
side
compared
to
giants
like
westmalle
koningshoeven
although
koningshoeven
is
quite
similar
in
sweetness
or
chimay
but
nonetheless
incredibly
complex
and
precise
dry
sweet
and
fruity
yet
elements
of
sourness
make
this
beer
very
enjoyable
there
is
an
amazing
breadth
to
this
beer
clearly
a
carefully
crafted
tripel
o
excellent
tripel
well
rounded
and
tasty
o
i
got
more
enjoyment
out
of
the
incredible
aroma
than
i
did
out
of
the
flavor
but
its
complexity
makes
it
easy
to
see
why
this
is
such
a
well
regarded
beer
overall
i
guess
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
its
good
but
i
prefer
la
fin
du
monde
and
delirium
tremens
d
defiantly
deserves
its
lofty
place
in
the
pecking
order
of
world
class
tripels
a
must
try
for
any
self
respecting
ba
something
that
i
will
gladly
drink
with
regularity
overall
found
it
enjoyable
and
complex
enough
with
a
distinct
personality
made
for
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
a
good
beer
and
worth
more
visits
if
a
belgianstyled
brew
is
what
youre
looking
for
o
a
good
tripel
overall
though
i
wish
the
yeast
werent
quite
so
dominant
still
its
tasty
and
very
drinkable
really
nice
tripel
here
it
is
dry
yet
sweet
in
taste
bitter
floral
slightly
bready
from
the
yeast
and
just
really
drinkable
o
fairly
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
o
a
mild
belgian
for
this
style
but
still
excellent
drink
up
guys
this
one
rocks
i
need
more
than
the
1
bottle
i
recieved
in
the
st
bernardus
4pack
with
the
free
snifter
to
evalute
this
betterbut
i
am
certainly
willing
to
do
more
research
o
a
nice
tripel
but
on
the
heavy
side
poured
into
my
favorite
orval
glass
1
and
half
finger
head
with
good
retention
which
left
behind
fluffy
cloud
like
head
lingering
on
top
for
the
whole
session
yeast
filled
body
with
a
orange
like
appearance
smell
was
of
orange
peelstrong
spices
fresh
honey
and
green
grapes
the
taste
is
a
bit
complex
with
this
beer
starting
out
sour
but
soon
a
sweet
finish
takes
over
the
honey
and
spices
add
the
right
balance
to
the
sourness
of
the
dried
grapes
a
very
drinkable
tripel
medium
bodied
and
nice
carbonation
i
want
more
overall
this
is
a
serious
tripel
its
dangerously
smooth
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
before
feeling
the
pain
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
it
goes
down
so
easy
o
not
as
impressed
by
this
as
i
thought
id
be
but
its
still
a
good
beer
just
not
great
o
like
all
other
st
bernardus
brews
its
simple
yet
elegantly
refined
o
a
very
nice
tripel
well
balanced
and
smooth
overall
a
solid
belgian
allaround
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
for
such
a
renowned
brewery
and
one
of
the
holy
trinity
of
tripels
westmalle
karmeliet
st
bernardus
but
the
butter
and
the
spice
didnt
mesh
for
me
and
i
didnt
pick
up
on
any
of
the
sweet
orchard
fruits
that
others
have
mentioned
still
id
put
more
than
a
few
but
not
many
tripels
above
this
one
served
in
a
branded
goblet
poured
an
orangeyyellow
colour
with
a
pure
white
head
a
full
finger
tall
a
spicey
nose
that
describes
the
flavour
perfectly
tasted
like
beer
with
hints
of
cardamom
and
a
little
cinnamon
not
as
sweet
and
rich
as
i
expected
a
belgian
tripel
to
be
id
pair
this
with
an
earthfired
pita
and
fresh
garlic
hummus
serving
temp
51f
o
another
great
beer
from
brouwerij
st
bernardus
there
is
so
much
flavor
and
its
just
far
superior
than
almost
any
other
tripel
i
have
ever
had
o
a
great
beer
i
love
tripels
and
this
is
a
good
one
however
it
just
falls
short
of
westmalle
and
karmeliet
in
my
view
due
to
not
having
the
same
level
of
intensity
in
flavour
st
bernardus
triple
25oz
bomber
i
love
belgian
style
beers
and
was
very
excited
to
try
this
highly
rated
triple
pouring
this
beer
into
a
glass
creates
a
huge
head
if
you
are
not
careful
the
head
will
fill
the
glass
in
an
instant
and
it
will
not
settle
for
a
long
while
the
head
really
is
the
outstanding
feature
of
this
triple
the
body
has
a
peachy
color
to
it
and
is
translucent
with
visible
sediment
floating
about
the
aroma
is
there
with
hints
of
champagne
and
apricots
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
the
belgian
yeast
and
bready
aromas
to
come
through
but
they
were
not
to
be
had
ok
on
to
the
flavors
the
st
bernardus
triple
stays
light
on
the
tongue
with
subtle
fruit
flavors
and
an
undercurrent
of
well
beer
taste
hmmm
i
guess
that
is
good
that
a
beer
tastes
like
beer
but
the
fun
of
belgian
style
ales
is
that
they
are
distinctively
so
unlike
beer
do
not
get
me
wrong
this
was
a
wonderful
triple
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
religious
experience
and
it
did
not
materialize
pours
a
medium
yellow
straw
color
with
a
nice
firm
white
head
with
a
bit
of
cloudiness
the
scent
is
green
apple
speice
and
a
touch
of
banana
the
taste
follows
the
nose
quite
closely
but
again
is
more
intense
than
i
expected
from
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
characteristic
of
st
bernardus
great
carbonation
and
very
cleansing
excellent
tripel
a
fairly
typical
and
well
done
example
of
what
i
would
expect
in
a
tripel
overall
this
is
quite
a
good
tripel
its
a
classic
for
obvious
reasons
im
not
as
impressed
with
it
as
i
wanted
to
be
but
its
still
plenty
impressive
complex
well
balanced
fabulous
coriander
really
comes
through
citrus
and
yeast
blended
to
perfection
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
ever
had
overall
very
great
brew
that
is
expertly
crafted
asd
i
expect
from
st
bernardus
the
gift
set
has
been
one
of
the
best
beer
investments
i
have
ever
made
extrordinarily
easy
drinking
but
certainly
no
lack
of
complexity
i
could
almost
knock
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
if
not
for
the
high
price
and
alcohol
a
really
fantastic
brew
not
even
going
to
fully
review
this
beer
it
was
such
a
huge
disappointment
from
a
reputable
dealer
so
i
know
nothing
was
wrong
with
it
either
it
is
way
too
carbonated
and
fizzy
so
plain
tasting
and
i
dare
say
it
tasted
like
a
slightly
better
budweiser
nothing
about
this
beer
tasted
good
or
of
anything
interesting
now
its
not
disgusting
or
horrible
but
it
was
borderline
bad
im
giving
it
a
3
because
i
dont
want
to
rip
such
an
apparent
legend
but
it
was
worse
than
that
super
disappointed
o
top
notch
tripel
everything
youd
expect
from
st
bernardus
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
pretty
much
defines
it
i
wanna
grab
some
of
this
and
see
what
it
becomes
in
5
or
so
years
o
4
5
overall
it
is
a
good
belgian
and
a
unique
trippel
this
is
worldclass
it
has
just
about
everything
i
look
for
in
a
tripel
bravo
o
its
a
good
tripel
i
know
its
known
as
one
of
the
paragons
of
the
style
but
its
not
my
favorite
even
so
everyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
but
i
was
really
expecting
something
more
complex
and
didnt
quite
have
the
wow
factor
d
remarkably
complex
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
one
ill
reach
for
again
o
does
it
get
any
better
in
the
style
ill
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
to
compare
but
this
is
great
fantastic
brew
smooth
tasty
good
body
and
structure
this
one
grabbed
a
rare
5
from
me
more
than
worthy
i
listen
to
joe
mcphee
port
of
saints
or
remembrance
to
go
with
this
wonderful
beer
a
couple
of
tremendous
cds
that
feature
studs
like
guitarist
raymond
boni
and
dominic
duval
on
bass
m
okay
ive
had
better
tripels
this
seemed
too
thin
the
la
fin
du
monde
by
unibroue
beats
this
one
actually
doa
o
good
tripel
lower
carbonation
would
ake
this
easier
to
drink
and
more
enjoyable
notes
my
first
st
bernardus
coming
from
a
gift
pack
heretofore
i
have
not
really
enjoyed
any
of
the
pale
belgian
ales
whether
they
be
bpas
saisons
etc
this
one
actually
is
pretty
good
the
flavors
are
well
harmonized
and
the
band
aid
flavor
does
not
overwhelm
time
will
tell
if
i
go
back
to
this
one
o
pretty
tasty
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
o
a
great
representation
of
the
style
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
more
than
a
top
notch
tripel
balance
spicy
fruity
boozy
delicious
poured
this
tripel
from
a
bottle
into
a
goblet
pours
a
cloudy
orangish
color
produces
a
white
creamy
head
and
has
some
of
the
thickest
lacing
i
have
ever
seen
the
aroma
smelled
of
orange
and
apricots
very
nice
medium
in
body
this
tripel
was
very
smooth
highest
marks
for
mouthfeel
a
base
of
toasted
malt
strong
citrus
flavor
lemon
and
orange
hints
of
ripe
apricots
and
then
moves
to
a
sweet
caramel
almost
candy
sugar
flavor
this
tripel
is
amazing
best
i
have
ever
had
so
many
flavors
shine
through
it
was
fun
to
analyze
semi
dry
finish
cant
wait
to
try
again
o
really
a
great
tripel
complex
playful
multilayered
not
as
impressed
with
this
beer
as
i
was
with
the
other
st
bernardus
beers
still
a
solid
beer
but
i
think
a
little
too
high
in
carbonation
for
tripels
it
finishes
right
above
average
for
me
good
beer
really
wish
the
last
two
sbs
i
reviewed
were
this
good
o
a
really
nice
brew
represents
the
style
to
a
tea
taste
great
looks
great
smells
perfect
ive
had
this
one
and
abt
12
and
loved
both
so
i
think
im
gonna
have
to
track
down
the
rest
o
having
just
tried
their
dubbel
6
and
loved
it
i
had
high
expectations
coming
into
this
beer
it
is
better
then
the
dubbel
6
another
great
offering
by
what
i
think
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
a
nice
enough
tripel
but
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
think
the
westmallekarmelietla
fin
du
monde
set
will
still
be
my
preferred
purchases
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
very
thick
offwhite
head
that
lingered
for
awhile
this
beer
had
a
very
sweet
aroma
sweeter
then
the
other
st
bernardus
beers
that
came
in
the
4
beer
and
glass
giftset
i
bought
it
tasted
very
yeasty
and
lemony
it
was
delicious
though
good
amount
of
carbonation
it
was
an
overall
delicious
beer
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
overalldefinitely
a
heavier
tripple
than
what
ive
had
before
good
solid
tripple
one
of
the
better
ones
affligem
still
holds
my
heart
on
triples
spices
and
orange
are
a
good
mix
poured
from
a
750
into
a
chimay
chalice
cloudy
dark
yellow
with
a
lose
foam
about
a
half
inch
dissipates
quick
to
a
film
the
first
smell
is
heavy
apple
cider
after
a
little
warming
it
reminds
me
of
canned
fruit
cocktail
taste
is
very
fruity
pineapple
citrus
apple
and
a
few
others
i
cant
define
slight
alcohol
finish
lots
of
carbonation
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
good
tripel
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
isnt
bad
its
well
balanced
the
belgian
yeast
definitely
does
its
thing
here
and
the
alcohol
level
is
well
masked
this
is
an
easy
drinking
tripel
pours
a
hazed
golden
orange
color
with
huge
plume
of
white
froth
decent
retention
and
lacing
scent
leads
with
a
lightly
sweet
blend
of
watery
fleshy
fruit
pear
and
apple
accented
with
citrus
rind
belgian
yeasts
bring
light
breadlines
along
with
hints
of
banana
moderate
spicing
grainy
sweet
malt
profile
taste
is
fruit
forward
before
the
spice
yeast
and
malt
blend
perfectly
as
the
beer
finishes
medium
bodied
bubbly
a
fantastic
fruity
triple
where
the
yeasts
and
spices
dont
overpower
i
was
going
to
give
this
a
4
5
overall
but
i
never
got
used
to
that
minty
feeling
still
a
world
class
beer
o
this
beer
was
good
but
borderline
cloying
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
i
guess
my
pallet
is
changing
or
ive
just
had
too
really
good
tripels
i
dont
normally
like
them
but
the
last
two
including
this
one
i
have
very
much
enjoyed
mouthfeel
was
ideal
i
enjoyed
every
sip
in
my
mouth
d
delicious
tripel
im
really
glad
i
tried
this
everything
is
great
in
this
brew
it
has
good
drinkability
and
the
high
abv
is
masked
well
o
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
prefer
the
abt
12
or
witbier
over
the
triple
its
sweet
smooth
and
simple
but
very
carbonated
im
glad
i
finally
had
this
beer
after
being
a
ba
for
so
long
well
overdue
in
my
opinion
crisp
simple
and
satisfying
i
love
it
to
death
its
an
amazing
beer
we
all
know
this
so
i
dont
have
to
tell
you
if
you
have
not
tried
it
just
buy
it
take
a
drink
and
understand
overall
drinkability
this
beer
is
all
about
the
smoothness
of
the
mouthfeel
and
inoffensive
characters
the
first
sip
is
really
complex
but
after
that
it
levels
off
and
becomes
less
so
this
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
some
spice
yeast
and
banana
were
on
the
nose
in
this
brew
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
nice
lightly
spiced
with
a
soft
sweetness
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
was
soft
medium
bodied
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
i
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
tripel
syle
and
typically
great
beer
from
st
bernardus
its
not
quite
my
favorite
selection
of
this
style
but
displays
itself
as
a
well
balanced
flavorful
and
ultimately
refreshing
beer
due
to
its
excessive
sweetness
its
not
something
id
buy
that
often
still
for
the
low
price
of
2
euros
here
in
france
its
definitely
a
bargain
unlike
anything
else
recommended
a
try
for
sure
medium
bodied
with
excessive
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
little
too
drinkable
considering
its
8
abv
the
body
is
just
right
to
allow
the
flavors
to
operate
at
full
capacity
while
not
being
too
thick
the
carbonation
is
extremely
fizzy
at
first
but
does
not
seem
to
imprede
on
the
flavors
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
this
beer
begs
to
be
gulped
not
sipped
now
i
know
better
this
triple
is
just
a
very
soft
one
like
tripel
karmeliet
and
corsendonk
nice
d
dangerously
drinkable
cold
or
a
little
warmed
up
st
bernardus
tripel
is
not
as
spiced
as
some
triples
la
fin
du
monde
comes
to
mind
a
truly
exceptional
triple
from
a
world
class
brewer
overall
very
tasty
brew
it
makes
me
nostalgic
about
being
in
bavaria
d
very
gentle
complexity
a
very
easy
drinking
tasty
tripel
this
beer
is
golden
colored
with
a
huge
white
head
the
smell
is
belgian
yeasty
spiceyness
as
well
as
a
bread
aroma
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
belgiany
flavors
coming
through
but
they
are
not
as
robust
as
they
are
i
other
tripels
i
have
had
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
good
but
not
my
favorite
tripel
o
st
bernardus
satiates
yet
again
aside
from
this
tripel
ive
also
had
their
quad
abt
12
which
is
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
this
beer
comes
close
and
is
a
perfect
tripel
in
my
opinion
followed
by
unibroues
la
fin
du
monde
highly
recommended
for
those
that
appreciate
sweeter
dessertstyle
beers
o
a
solid
tripel
deserving
of
its
status
as
one
of
the
classics
in
the
style
been
on
a
tripel
kick
in
the
last
few
months
it
seems
and
this
one
is
up
there
but
not
at
the
top
overall
impression
while
picking
up
this
caramel
flavor
i
am
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
tripel
not
as
strong
and
full
bodied
as
i
would
like
it
is
too
sweet
wishing
there
was
more
spice
and
body
in
this
brew
will
be
looking
for
again
to
compare
notes
but
not
like
the
other
st
bernardus
beers
ive
had
in
their
ranks
though
the
st
bernardus
is
a
touch
too
sweet
for
me
as
far
as
triples
go
its
still
a
very
good
brew
and
nothing
to
turn
my
nose
up
at
a
lovely
offering
from
st
bernardus
and
everything
one
could
really
hope
for
in
a
tripel
nicely
balanced
well
constructed
bravo
good
carbonation
zesty
yet
smooth
a
good
sipping
beer
the
high
abv
makes
this
a
nice
beer
to
end
the
evening
with
oa
carefully
constructed
tripel
very
sophisticated
and
nuanced
a
classic
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
classic
approach
to
the
belgian
tripel
and
is
a
very
good
solid
demonstration
of
it
for
me
the
high
amounts
of
carbonation
were
a
bit
of
a
distraction
but
the
flavor
profile
stood
on
its
own
overall
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
but
not
the
best
overall
another
excellent
tripel
perfect
summer
drinking
pours
a
bubbly
sunny
golden
color
under
a
billowing
thick
mass
of
white
foam
that
very
slowly
but
never
completely
dissolves
aromas
of
pale
fruity
esters
pear
apricot
cherry
banana
yeast
soft
flowers
lemon
sweetness
and
spicy
orange
rind
the
flavor
is
packed
full
of
spiced
fruity
esters
blanketing
a
mellow
pale
maltiness
and
peppery
phenols
soft
yet
fullflavored
and
very
well
rounded
somewhat
doughy
yeast
citrus
rind
dryness
apple
and
honey
smooth
and
creamy
wellcarbonated
with
the
slightest
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
excellent
tripel
as
one
would
expect
o
tripel
strong
pale
ales
are
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
no
exception
highly
recommended
overall
a
good
beer
however
not
my
favorite
from
my
favorite
breweries
excellent
as
always
this
beer
was
quite
excellent
and
i
must
admit
that
im
not
someone
who
particularly
enjoys
tripels
i
will
happily
add
a
new
tripel
to
the
others
that
i
enjoy
la
fin
du
monde
and
karmeliet
opretty
average
for
a
tripel
overall
not
as
harsh
as
some
tend
to
get
easy
drinking
and
fairly
boring
no
something
i
need
to
get
again
o
awesome
triple
but
the
only
time
ive
ever
seen
it
was
part
of
the
sampler
gift
glass
pack
so
im
sure
its
kinda
hard
to
find
but
still
a
great
beer
regardless
of
nose
its
still
a
fantastic
brew
wonderful
tasting
very
unique
and
crushing
feel
beer
delicious
the
taste
up
front
is
certainly
citrus
peach
some
banana
with
spice
in
the
middle
the
selection
of
flowery
hops
balances
the
fruity
beginning
at
the
end
we
enjoy
belgian
yeast
and
a
delicate
grainy
aftertaste
very
well
composed
and
extremely
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
would
drink
this
beer
at
any
time
great
job
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
oranges
and
lemons
with
some
belgian
yeast
notes
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
bready
malt
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
belgian
candy
sugar
with
some
orange
and
bready
malt
notes
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
present
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
a
decent
beer
something
to
definitely
consider
if
you
enjoy
tripels
dr
nothing
special
but
fairly
priced
if
youre
in
belgium
give
it
a
go
but
dont
expect
a
great
abbey
beer
othis
is
a
quality
brew
very
comforting
and
refreshing
pours
and
deep
and
dark
golden
yellow
with
some
haze
and
three
fingers
of
a
frothy
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
some
thick
lacing
smells
beautiful
with
a
heavy
dose
of
belgian
yeast
citrus
apple
and
spice
some
banana
is
in
there
too
taste
is
equally
as
complex
with
some
nice
sweetness
and
belgian
spice
blend
perfectly
with
the
yeast
and
the
citrus
fullerbodied
for
the
style
with
vibrant
carbonation
perhaps
my
favorite
tripel
oprobably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
had
several
other
tripels
including
la
fin
du
monde
and
i
still
prefer
this
one
great
beer
and
i
will
enjoy
it
for
many
years
to
come
medium
body
with
lighter
than
expected
carbonation
i
wish
i
could
rate
this
as
well
as
everyone
else
i
love
theor
other
brews
a
lot
but
this
one
just
came
up
short
to
me
im
hoping
this
one
is
bad
honestly
over
all
this
was
a
great
trippel
very
complex
it
took
a
long
time
to
decipher
all
the
flavors
present
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
trippels
i
have
ever
had
highly
recommend
o
tasty
tripel
and
surprisingly
hoppy
on
the
finish
a
treat
indeed
and
a
quality
example
of
the
style
high
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
making
it
dangerously
drinkable
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
anything
st
bernardus
produces
d
great
tripel
great
blend
of
ingredients
to
create
a
unique
tripel
brew
love
st
bernardus
beers
highly
recommended
o
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
triples
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
westamalles
but
equally
delicious
note
this
was
from
the
750ml
bottle
have
not
tried
the
11
2
oz
overall
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
special
wow
ive
never
really
been
a
fan
of
belgian
beers
but
this
is
one
amazing
beer
i
will
be
very
sure
to
pick
up
other
offerings
by
this
brewer
and
will
look
to
have
this
one
again
as
well
o
i
really
noticed
how
much
more
refined
this
beer
was
once
it
warmed
up
let
it
sit
for
10
min
after
pulling
from
the
fridge
to
work
up
its
self
esteem
delicious
second
fiddle
only
to
tripel
karmeliet
just
about
perfect
there
isnt
a
lot
more
to
be
said
about
this
beer
that
hasnt
already
been
said
but
in
my
mind
this
is
just
about
the
pinnacle
of
a
tripel
light
bodied
above
average
carbonation
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
i
know
tripels
tend
to
be
sweet
and
i
really
like
sweet
beers
but
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
went
overboard
for
me
overall
this
is
a
serious
tripel
i
am
enjoying
it
greatly
this
is
an
amazing
and
powerful
beer
not
for
chugging
due
to
its
intense
floral
characteristics
a
real
sipper
even
at
8
do
nice
mouthfeel
and
smooth
a
very
drinkable
tripel
not
as
sweet
tart
as
some
others
o
sweeter
and
less
boozy
than
an
average
triple
but
not
overly
so
the
flavors
strike
a
fantastic
balance
of
fruit
spice
malt
and
booze
o
this
is
a
world
class
beer
and
one
of
the
best
tripels
on
the
planet
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
buy
this
beer
whenever
you
see
it
id
love
to
have
this
on
draft
someday
but
its
near
perfect
the
way
it
is
cheers
o
a
complex
and
delicious
tripel
dangerously
drinkable
certainly
one
worthy
of
having
again
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
with
tons
of
fruity
flavors
meshing
together
really
balanced
fine
drinker
pear
and
apples
light
banana
and
tropical
fruits
light
grains
and
ethanol
spiciness
cloves
light
sweetness
with
a
pleasant
dry
finish
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
hides
it
well
one
of
the
smoothest
balanced
easy
drinking
tripels
ive
had
to
date
recommended
d
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
very
much
d
excellent
drinkability
another
easy
drinking
trappiste
ale
big
surprise
balanced
crisp
and
delicious
o
this
bottle
is
nearly
3
years
old
and
would
of
held
on
a
lot
longer
i
think
this
brewery
kicks
the
hell
out
of
a
lot
of
the
trappist
brews
imo
and
this
beer
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
i
need
to
grab
some
more
of
this
stuff
just
a
solid
allaround
brew
served
in
a
maredsous
goblet
not
too
cold
has
a
lovely
apricot
color
and
is
opaque
nice
white
collar
that
fades
quick
but
stubbornly
retains
the
whole
way
down
minimal
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
very
fruity
little
alcohol
and
mild
clove
notes
first
taste
is
a
little
tart
up
front
with
some
biting
alcohol
but
nothing
extreme
mellows
out
nicely
pears
are
prevalent
as
are
apples
sweet
got
some
coriander
in
there
finishes
fairly
clean
with
a
lingering
alcohol
mintyness
not
overly
complex
actually
pretty
straight
forward
for
a
tripel
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
very
smooth
great
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
distract
from
the
flavors
going
on
an
easy
drinking
trip
for
sure
o
this
didnt
blow
me
away
but
its
a
really
solid
beer
a
little
hard
to
grade
id
like
to
give
it
a
4
25
on
tasteoverall
so
i
had
to
settle
for
4
and
4
5
the
one
complaint
is
that
the
nice
floral
and
fruit
flavors
fade
very
quickly
on
the
palate
and
leave
a
rather
and
somewhat
bland
finish
buy
or
just
die
ok
so
i
expected
a
little
more
but
ill
leave
this
one
being
satisfied
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
murky
dark
orange
in
color
with
a
two
finger
almost
pure
white
foamy
head
the
aromas
consist
of
bready
pale
malts
a
boatload
of
yeast
citrus
bananas
and
cloves
this
has
a
nice
spice
to
it
the
flavor
is
very
but
in
a
light
manner
it
has
a
lot
of
yeast
and
citrus
to
it
and
is
mildly
sweet
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
for
a
tripel
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
beer
drinks
as
smooth
as
any
tripel
that
isnt
la
fin
du
monde
it
almost
melts
in
your
mouth
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
im
convinced
this
brewery
can
do
no
wrong
at
this
point
id
highly
recommend
this
one
this
has
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
out
there
o
simply
outstanding
a
great
tripel
probably
my
favorite
thusfar
again
wow
unfortunately
not
one
of
my
favorites
you
cant
likeem
all
d
high
love
that
typical
tripel
yeastyfruity
combo
wacky
aroma
scores
this
lower
than
it
should
be
though
alcohol
tingles
a
little
in
the
mouth
and
its
certainly
present
in
the
aroma
but
buried
neath
the
fruity
yeast
expertly
woven
into
the
beery
fabric
of
this
brew
different
from
the
pack
beer
you
could
swill
a
lot
of
if
endlessly
available
incredibly
drinkable
beer
the
booze
is
quite
hidden
and
the
taste
is
wonderful
might
be
my
favourite
tripel
d
the
overall
balance
of
this
beer
ranks
it
amongst
the
cream
of
tripels
well
worth
a
try
carbonation
is
so
minimal
that
it
definitely
hurts
the
beer
but
i
think
this
is
an
isolated
case
of
my
faulty
bottle
so
i
really
want
to
try
another
pours
a
cloudy
golden
blonde
with
particulate
caught
in
a
sort
of
static
dance
permanently
placed
in
equilibrium
throughout
the
beer
a
tall
retentive
head
about
12
the
height
of
the
liquid
persists
for
a
couple
of
minutes
before
fading
mild
aromas
of
clear
candies
with
hints
of
spice
and
perhaps
some
very
subtle
fruits
come
off
the
pour
similar
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
creamy
full
of
the
clear
candy
with
hints
of
spice
and
fruitvery
mild
throughout
not
much
complexity
which
is
to
be
expected
for
the
style
however
compared
to
the
st
bernardus
siblings
i
find
myself
left
wanting
more
moderately
full
in
the
mouth
and
smooth
through
the
swallow
and
finish
leaving
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
it
remains
true
to
the
tripel
but
lacks
some
character
best
to
stick
with
the
abt
12
and
prior
8
imo
i
wonder
why
this
is
the
first
time
im
drinking
this
its
easy
to
obtain
and
fairly
cheap
mind
you
that
i
live
in
holland
westmalle
gets
all
the
love
but
this
one
is
a
winner
as
well
will
be
pciking
this
up
more
often
recomended
d
this
is
a
classic
trip
and
one
that
id
take
any
day
another
killer
brew
from
one
of
the
best
d
a
very
well
crafted
tripel
balance
is
the
key
here
there
is
a
lot
going
on
and
it
all
seems
to
blend
together
near
flawlessly
really
like
the
fruity
aspects
of
this
beer
the
subdued
alcohol
even
at
8
and
the
smooth
body
not
sure
why
its
taken
me
so
long
to
review
this
one
definitely
one
i
come
back
to
fairly
often
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
carbonated
and
sweet
in
your
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
sweetened
apples
and
grapes
this
would
be
perfect
to
pair
with
fruit
quite
refreshing
one
of
the
best
and
most
unique
belgian
ales
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
experiencing
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
high
level
of
carbonation
make
this
freakishly
drinkable
the
alcohol
goes
nearly
unnoticed
fantastic
brew
pours
a
nice
opaque
golden
orange
color
with
one
finger
of
dense
offwhite
head
aroma
is
citrus
rose
waterfloral
and
spice
taste
is
also
citrusy
sweet
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
there
is
also
a
very
mild
bitterness
towards
the
end
that
merges
into
a
lightly
bitter
finishing
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
very
nice

into
tulip
clear
effervescent
golden
body
is
overlain
by
airy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
and
completely
dissipates
id
expect
the
head
to
be
firmer
and
creating
more
lace
as
subsides
aroma
exhibits
light
somewhat
bready
toasty
malt
character
with
a
nice
interplay
of
fruity
esters
phenols
sweetness
and
alcohol
the
significant
fruity
esters
are
represented
by
orange
pineapple
mango
and
peach
followed
by
moderate
spicy
and
clovelike
phenols
evident
candy
sugar
sweetness
and
restrained
soft
spicy
alcohol
as
far
as
the
aroma
section
is
considered
the
balance
between
esters
and
phenols
is
leaned
towards
the
former
while
in
the
flavor
dept
the
later
prevail
soft
malty
body
embraces
dominant
peppery
phenols
and
spicy
alcohol
flavor
subdued
citrusy
esters
of
orange
and
moderately
high
bitterness
that
seems
to
result
especially
from
the
yeastderived
phenols
as
well
as
from
hoppy
bitterness
the
relatively
high
bitterness
combines
with
moderate
carbonation
to
lend
a
dry
finish
with
spicy
aftertaste
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
somewhat
creamy
from
the
slightly
warming
alcohol
drink
its
a
st
b
triple
you
know
its
good
verdict
full
of
character
balanced
well
enjoyable
throughout
and
easily
quaffable
st
bernardus
tripel
is
a
great
little
brew
its
perhaps
my
favorite
tripel
so
far
as
well
as
a
stellar
introduction
to
the
brand
the
cpj
drinkability
is
high
glass
was
empty
before
i
knew
it
mouthfeel
is
full
with
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
excellent
beer
even
more
flavor
as
it
warms
the
feel
of
this
brew
is
subtle
and
works
well
with
the
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
fizz
this
might
be
my
favorite
so
far
from
the
boys
at
st
bernardus
the
taste
is
on
the
money
and
mouthfeel
and
nose
are
right
there
too
well
worth
checking
out
st
bernardus
abt
12
is
better
but
this
is
one
hekuva
beer
d
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
good
overall
i
would
really
enjoy
another
one
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
this
was
a
bit
of
a
gusher
it
poured
a
turibd
gold
and
had
a
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
sweet
and
fruity
the
spiciness
of
this
is
more
balanced
than
other
triples
lots
of
sweet
fruit
some
clove
some
grass
it
has
a
drying
finish
the
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
medium
body
high
carbonation
a
very
enjoyable
triple
may
have
to
try
a
750
of
this
one
d
very
solid
beer
easy
to
drink
and
very
happy
to
receive
this
gift
overall
i
think
i
like
the
westmalle
tripel
the
best
but
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
get
one
if
you
can
drinkability
smooth
with
just
a
little
alcohol
bite
on
the
end
over
all
it
was
very
good
a
solid
tripel
i
was
a
little
tipsy
when
i
reviewed
this
so
the
notes
arent
great
but
as
critical
as
i
am
it
must
be
a
good
beer
overall
excellent
triple
maybe
my
new
favorite
st
bernardus
is
highly
respected
yet
i
still
feel
they
are
a
bit
underrated
one
of
the
top
belgian
breweries
or
in
the
world
for
that
matter
d
this
is
an
absolute
delight
to
this
tripel
fan
poured
hazy
orange
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
that
lasted
with
excellent
lacing
complex
citrus
fruit
and
yeasty
aroma
medium
body
with
a
sticky
texture
and
lively
carbonation
medium
fruity
balanced
flavor
with
a
medium
sweet
sour
finish
of
long
duration
with
a
small
alcohol
bite
this
is
a
good
beer
d
bitter
tart
and
overcarbonated
hard
to
swallow
even
for
its
style
in
my
opinion
peppery
finish
makes
it
especially
harsh
d
good
very
flavorful
prefect
example
of
what
a
tripel
should
taste
like
md
carbonation
dances
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
top
of
the
palate
thin
to
medium
body
beer
goes
down
very
easily
better
then
most
triples
i
have
had
but
still
not
a
fan
d
pretty
drinkable
all
in
all
not
really
appealing
but
it
has
its
moments
overall
its
just
not
a
complete
beer
to
me
its
lacking
major
flavor
connections
and
enhancements
drinkable
104
good
buddy
average
body
well
hidden
alcohol
malty
aftertaste
then
fruity
o
i
think
st
bernardus
is
a
class
act
the
king
of
the
secular
brewers
that
brew
abbey
style
beers
this
beer
lives
up
to
it
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
finest
tripels
out
there
and
has
a
one
up
on
la
trappes
tripel
in
my
ranking
book
this
is
a
regular
in
my
tripel
line
up
and
should
be
in
yours
not
to
strong
not
to
heavy
or
sweet
just
good
and
a
nice
beer
to
knock
a
few
down
the
aroma
is
strong
in
the
spice
and
yeast
department
its
strong
and
wafting
out
for
feet
i
cant
help
but
give
the
taste
a
5
there
is
so
much
juicy
citrus
packed
into
each
sip
with
a
tangy
yeast
light
tartness
over
all
the
crisp
fruits
like
pear
and
apple
and
esters
this
is
greatness
this
is
so
approachable
and
the
light
dryness
just
begs
you
to
to
set
the
glass
down
d
wonderful
drinkability
its
beers
like
this
that
make
me
want
to
be
a
monk
and
brew
beer
all
day
try
this
beer
you
will
not
be
disappointed
drinkability
not
bad
i
could
actually
drink
more
than
one
of
the
11
2
oz
bottles
the
only
thing
slowing
me
down
was
the
abv
with
an
able
assist
from
the
prior
8
2
would
be
enough
for
me
if
drinking
it
solo
more
hazy
golden
to
look
at
than
westmalle
tripel
this
beer
keeps
a
constant
thinnish
head
theres
a
firm
zesty
honey
quality
on
the
nose
as
it
begins
spritzy
and
ends
with
a
zing
though
solid
and
reliable
this
just
doesnt
fully
deliver
the
complexity
and
development
i
would
expect
from
a
top
tripel
good
but
not
great
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
the
abv
is
moderately
high
but
very
well
incorporated
into
the
beer
the
nose
was
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
as
soon
as
i
sipped
it
i
was
delighted
its
simply
art
in
a
glass
st
bernardus
is
quite
frankly
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
d
even
at
this
abv
killer
session
just
do
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
short
lasting
head
nice
sweet
aroma
of
yeast
fruit
brown
sugar
and
spices
mouth
feel
is
harsh
and
dry
full
body
taste
is
very
similar
to
aroma
yeast
sugar
and
fruit
banana
and
apricots
with
some
spice
notes
long
earthy
finish
very
nice
complex
brew
not
very
easy
to
drink
though
d
an
excellent
triple
everything
i
was
expecting
has
a
nice
balance
and
smoothness
a
very
clean
take
on
the
style
without
being
too
earthy
or
funky
very
tasty
one
and
plenty
to
love
drinkabilty
if
it
wasnt
for
the
alcohol
this
would
be
higher
a
fantastic
triple
lots
of
flavor
smooth
not
overly
bitter
one
of
the
best
will
drink
again
drinkability
loved
every
sip
its
just
a
shame
i
can
only
find
this
beer
sold
in
singles
and
for
more
then
i
want
to
spend
on
a
regular
basis
d
a
very
well
done
brew
here
i
will
certainly
buy
this
again
drinkability
this
is
an
extremely
flavorful
and
fairly
easydrinking
tripel
i
feel
like
a
fool
for
overlooking
st
bernardus
for
so
long
this
is
a
super
drinkable
tripel
that
is
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
not
nearly
as
in
your
face
as
some
other
examples
and
light
on
the
palate
besides
some
hotness
in
the
nose
you
would
never
guess
this
is
an
8
abv
brew
highly
recommended
d
extremely
drinkable
d
a
great
tripel
all
around
at
8
i
thought
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
loved
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
would
certainly
have
again
d
a
really
well
put
together
tripel
booze
is
well
hidden
this
is
a
must
try
tripel
overall
if
i
dont
find
some
strange
in
the
way
of
tripels
when
i
shop
this
is
likely
the
one
ill
take
home
when
the
tripel
mood
strikes
which
is
frequent
aroma
of
grapefruit
hints
of
hops
pours
a
nice
amber
golden
haze
very
lively
beer
nice
medium
head
a
very
doughy
tripel
different
from
any
other
tripel
i
have
had
has
notes
of
banana
and
even
bubblegum
which
is
a
first
for
me
with
beers
a
creamy
beer
that
has
some
bitter
on
the
backend
a
delicious
brew
but
not
of
the
level
of
the
chimay
chouffe
or
tripel
karmeliet
d
although
its
as
dry
as
cotton
its
got
great
flavor
and
is
quite
drinkable
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
a
great
one
to
end
the
night
with
d
on
the
fruity
spicy
side
of
the
style
but
very
nice
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
still
an
enjoyable
one
pours
a
very
hazy
nearly
opaque
golden
copper
color
an
aggressive
pour
yielded
two
fingers
of
off
white
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
few
millimeters
the
first
thing
i
noticed
in
the
smell
was
a
sour
note
there
was
also
some
orange
peel
but
the
sour
note
didnt
match
this
some
spice
and
caramel
sweetness
as
well
after
further
sniffing
the
offputting
sour
faded
and
the
caramel
came
on
more
prominently
pretty
sweet
initially
then
a
fruity
note
comes
through
this
part
is
very
good
orange
stands
out
and
banana
and
bubblegum
are
pretty
faint
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
biting
but
it
matched
the
taste
quite
nicely
it
also
seemed
to
aid
in
the
peppery
finish
alcohol
was
hardly
noticeable
pretty
tasty
brew
a
somewhat
complicated
tripel
more
hops
that
expected
less
malt
in
the
same
vein
overall
this
lead
to
a
very
drinkable
until
the
wellintegrated
8
points
of
booze
kick
in
big
boy
beer
from
the
other
brothers
fairly
easy
to
drink
tripel
but
the
slight
alcohol
burn
does
warn
you
that
this
is
a
fairly
hard
hitting
beer
at

abv
a
nice
effort
from
st
bernardus
this
is
what
every
belgian
tripel
should
aspire
to
taste
like
fantastic
complex
and
well
balanced
once
again
the
monks
show
us
how
to
brew
a
well
crafted
beer
d
at
8
abv
it
is
a
one
at
a
time
kind
of
beer
but
a
very
balanced
and
very
drinkable
tripel
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
as
always
it
is
hard
to
go
wrong
with
st
bernardus
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
at
8
abv
drinkability
really
a
tasty
beer
so
i
would
want
to
drink
more
considering
this
factor
but
overall
improvements
could
be
made
d
i
love
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
one
every
day
if
my
cash
flow
allowed
great
complexities
smoooth
and
an
alcohol
content
that
would
keep
you
grounded
cheers
drinkability
balanced
and
a
very
hidden
abv
watch
out
after
a
few
of
these
because
you
wont
know
what
hit
you
i
know
i
didnt
the
first
time
i
drank
it
drinkability
im
sort
of
glad
ive
only
got
one
of
these
to
drink
at
8
percent
abv
and
with
this
kind
of
flavor
i
might
end
up
drinking
a
bit
too
much
this
is
an
amazing
beer
its
a
shame
there
are
not
more
triple
style
beers
made
in
the
states
overall
another
great
beer
by
st
b
as
i
said
earlier
this
is
a
textbook
tripel
not
real
sweet
not
real
tart
just
right
great
beer
as
i
expected
anything
less
drinkability
high
quality
stuff
though
not
overly
complex
it
is
loveable
very
tasty
and
drinkable
d
very
good
tripel
but
alcohol
might
be
evident
a
little
bit
i
highly
recommend
it
nonetheless
da
very
fine
beer
that
is
quite
expensive
i
really
like
their
quad
but
this
doesnt
seem
remarkable
in
the
same
way
o
high
drinkability
great
beer
excellent
st
bernardus
specimen
such
a
smooth
and
supple
tripel
its
such
a
lightly
done
one
with
everything
so
well
integrated
that
i
feel
like
many
of
the
other
examples
just
dont
get
it
beautiful
stuff
overall
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
amazing
but
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
must
try
especially
if
you
like
trappist
or
belgian
style
ales
personally
this
style
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
it
again
hazy

blonde

tropical

notes
with
a
touch

and
bready
yeast
light
citrus
fruity
and
banana
estery
flavors
with
a
bit
of
coriander
and
mild
citric
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
truly
perfectly
bananced
medium
bodied
with
seltzery
carbonation
st
bernardus
tripel
is
a
world
class
beer
that
may
be
taken
for
granted
because
of
wide
availability
d
very
drinkable
and
truely
classic
one
of
my
favorite
but
felt
as
if
it
could
use
a
little
something
extra
to
really
put
it
over
the
top
drinkability
one
of
if
not
my
absolute
favorite
tripels
this
will
frequently
be
found
in
my
fridge
d
nice
tripel
but
i
tracked
this
one
down
and
i
feel
it
was
a
waste
of
time
and
would
not
get
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
very
high
with
an
almost
champagne
like
bubbly
quality
drinkability
is
good
it
was
a
very
flavorful
and
well
balanced
beer
overall
and
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
drinkability
is
amazing
with
this
brew
the
breadiness
coupled
with
the
sweet
fruit
flavorings
and
pleasantly
chewy
mouthfeel
make
this
tripel
incredibly
easy
to
quaff
it
tastes
almost
like
a
slightly
boozier
version
of
a
hefeweizen
which
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
styles
of
beer
st
bernardus
really
has
a
dandy
of
a
drink
in
this
it
has
done
what
i
thought
impossible
and
knocked
off
the
venerable
la
fin
du
monde
as
my
favorite
tripel
cheers
to
those
merry
monks
who
really
know
how
to
brew
for
such
a
wellregarded
beer
i
must
admit
my
expectations
were
a
bit
high
and
unfortunately
not
met
poured
slightly
hazy
ambertinged
gold
with
lively
sharp
carbonation
and
a
shortlived
head
bright
in
the
mouth
with
prickly
carbonation
flavor
profile
was
a
bit
flat
and
onedimensional
with
apple
notes
lacking
the
peppery
and
phenolic
notes
i
associate
with
the
best
examples
of
the
style
dthis
is
full
of
flavor
that
is
well
integrated
and
balanced
tasty
tripel
that
has
everything
you
want
to
see
a
more
dry
finish
and
stronger
malt
presence
to
balance
may
help
but
still
very
solid
ample
carbonation
and
a
light
dry
mouthfeel
banana
and
clove
up
front
followed
sweet
biscuit
and
a
lingering
pepper
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
wellmasked
and
the
flavors
are
nicely
complex
but
this
one
was
just
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
palate
d
could
drink
many
of
these
a
superb
tasting
beer
st
bernardus
has
been
good
so
far
the
abt
12
is
better
imo
but
this
is
worth
trying
the
mouthfeel
is
of
a
fairly
light
body
with
good
carbonation
it
went
down
pretty
easy
abv
is
well
hidden
i
could
well
go
for
another
a
solid
triple
d
glass
went
quickly
solid
beer
like
every
other
st
bernardus
brew
d
a
pretty
darn
good
tripel
not
the
best
but
well
deserving
of
its
ranks
in
our
top
beers
list
d
i
see
this
as
a
brew
that
hides
the
abv
very
well
nice
notes
and
a
great
overall
drinkability
i
would
consider
this
one
of
the
many
of
the
style
to
be
represented
well
o
very
very
nice
ive
been
passing
on
tripels
for
the
past
few
months
but
lately
have
been
on
kind
of
a
tripel
bender
get
it
lately
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
makes
me
want
to
have
a
lot
more
d
i
have
not
had
this
one
in
a
few
years
and
i
was
not
that
impressed
much
better
examples
of
tripels
out
there
though
this
is
still
a
good
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
from
people
that
have
been
doing
this
for
a
long
time

is
definitely
a
hit
in

opinion

of

head
shows
great
staying
power
and

a

spicy
in
that
expected
belgian
way
with
yeasty
slightly
malty
undercurrents
taste
is
upfront
delicately
fruity
following
with
hearty
malt
character
and
only
the
slightest
hint
of
the
alcohol
we
know
all
tripels
have
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
are
both
excellent
d
i
once
thought
that
trappist
ales
were
the
best
beers
available
as
i
get
older
the
ipas
and
the
darker
stuff
has
more
appeal
to
me
not
bad
though
would
drink
again
d
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
definitely
a
great
beer
delicious
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
once
the
cork
was
popped
there
was
a
huge
gush
i
had
to
do
a
mad
rush
to
try
and
save
as
much
as
possible
once
poured
it
was
a
light
cloudy
orange
colour
with
huge
white
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
sweet
bubblegum
and
belgian
yeast
with
some
spices
flavour
is
much
of
the
same
little
bit
of
bitterness
too
but
quite
sweet
carbonation
is
a
bit
overthetop
as
evidenced
by
the
gushing
creamy
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
dry
finish
the
forward
is
mildly
sweet
the
midpalate
is
moderately
sweet
and
estery
the
yeast
character
is
lower
than
youd
expect
this
beer
is
awesome
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
ever
had
it
does
show
a
lot
of
tart
and
almost
sour
aspects
which
will
drive
some
people
away
however
if
your
plate
is
more
attuned
or
if
you
naturally
enjoy
this
type
of
flavor
you
will
absolutely
adore
this
beer
it
is
a
great
aperitif
and
would
also
pair
well
with
stronger
vegetables
like
asparagus
or
artichoke
and
hummus
or
similar
middle
eastern
spreads
would
also
be
perfect
for
this
magnificent
abbey
tripel
its
good
but
not
as
drinkable
as
others
in
the
style
man
i
am
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
st
bernardus
relative
to
the
whoever
has
been
driving
their
ratings
way
up
this
tripel
is
good
but
not
great
finally
got
around
to
one
of
these
worth
the
wait
sexy
looking
bugger
massive
evenly
spread
head
and
very
smart
lacing
the
tripel
to
end
all
tripels
great
nose
of
banana
orange
rind
nutmeg
and
yeasty
goodness
mouthfeel
is
full
and
luscious
on
the
palate
the
phenols
come
out
to
play
along
with
the
hops
toffee
brittle
comes
to
mind
the
bitter
sweet
finish
is
simply
boneriffic
primo
d
the
beer
wasnt
too
difficult
to
drink
considering
its
alcohol
content
which
is
well
hidden
i
will
definitely
try
this
one
again
as
it
is
one
of
the
best
representations
of
the
style
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
very
complex
aroma
with

warm

strong

golden
raisins
nice
creamy
medium
body
with
lots
of
soft
carbonation
d
this
review
is
the
first
time
ever
trying
st
b
tripel
it
is
definitely
a
well
crafted
beer
as
i
would
expect
nothing
less
the
initial
opening
of
this
beer
did
not
go
according
to
plan
so
i
will
have
to
do
a
2nd
take
and
see
how
it
goes
pours
a
bit
dark
with
the
style
with
a
billowing
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nice
belgian
spice
with
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
similar
with
the
addition
of
some
clove
medium
body
with
good
spicing
drinkability
isnt
quite
as
good
as
many
of
the
stalwarts
of
the
style
despite
a
nice
taste
it
doesnt
leave
me
clamoring
for
more
d
this
is
extremely
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
as
this
warms
more
honey
lemon
and
subtle
spices
appear
i
can
easily
finish
a
lot
of
this
quickly
but
that
would
defeat
the
point
jd
this
isnt
the
best
tripel
ive
had
but
it
is
very
good
drinkability
due
to
the
mouthfeel
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
on
the
lighter
side
in
regards
to
taste
and
feel
so
i
can
drink
many
more
of
these
unfortunately
its
higher
in
alcohol
content
than
most
beers
so
drinking
this
for
long
periods
of
time
could
be
interesting
very
rich
and
delicious
this
is
à
good
example
for
the
style
taste
has
assertive
carbonation
yet
is
soft
in
the
mouth
at
the
same
time
the
banana
and
clove
are
more
prominent
and
meld
with
the
candied
sugar
nicely
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
although
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
a
couple
in
a
row
with
the
alcohol
content
at
8
a
good
change
of
pace
for
someone
who
doesnt
drink
belgian
ales
very
often
this
suffered
from
being
poured
into
a
pint
glass
having
said
that
while
theres
a
lot
of
sweet
and
spice
going
on
here
i
prefer
the
drier
end
of
tripels
this
one
is
just
too
much
of
a
meal
d
very
nice
beer
that
is
crisp
yet
fruity
and
very
alive
with
the
yeast
profile
great
beer
that
monk
is
just
so
dern
happy
all
the
time
he
must
be
enjoying
nighconstant
bernardus
brews
thisa
one
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
straw
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
heavy
clove
and
pepper
banana
spicy
yeast
a
tiny
bit
o
that
farmhouse
stuff
hmm
and
some
lemon
zest
basically
it
smells
like
a
tripel
the
taste
follows
brining
those
spices
to
the
fore
backed
by
some
nice
banana
and
citurs
blends
and
finishing
with
a
nice
flourish
of
pepper
and
cardamom
the
body
is
a
fluffy
medium
with
a
sharp
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
nearly
archetypal
tripel
get
some
and
be
as
happy
as
the
monk
d
at
8
its
not
oppressive
but
tasty
and
light
i
sat
on
a
patio
in
brussels
and
drank
the
bottle
dry
a
tasty
tripel
and
very
good
its
not
my
favourite
but
i
would
have
it
again
overall
this
is
delightful
tripel
that
is
smooth
full
of
nice
malt
flavors
and
the
finish
reminds
you
of
this
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
cant
go
wrong
here
for
a
nice
pale
color
belgian
d
st
bernardus
good
as
always
definitely
a
beer
to
have
the
carbonation
and
crisp
hoppiness
make
this
very
light
and
easy
drinking
poured
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
tiny
sediment
floating
around
very
carbonated
with
large
head
that
slowly
minimizes
smells
of
alcohol
and
citrusytropical
fruits
nothing
really
dark
or
berrylike
hints
of
banana
tastes
very
sweet
with
banana
and
other
fruity
flavors
fizzy
mouthful
maybe
a
little
too
carbonated
but
still
very
delicious
very
high
drinkability
very
crisp
and
refreshing
for
hot
summer
days
had
a
fair
amount
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
but
smell
and
flavor
were
unaffected
very
carbonated
after
opening
almost
fizzy
you
can
pick
up
light
malt
in
the
nose
and
i
could
definitely
smell
the
alcohol
appearance
in
the
glass
after
pour
is
cloudy
and
hay
colored
definitely
a
well
balanced
beer
light
floral
hoppiness
contrasts
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
effervescence
keeps
the
beer
drinkable
and
saves
it
from
being
an
other
wise
pretty
heavy
beer
in
my
opinion
a
damn
good
brew
served
from
bottle
into
a
chimay
goblet
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
yellow
with
onefinger
white
head
that
subsides
to
a
minimal
amount
lacing
was
minimal
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
fruit
and
slight
alcohol
notes
the
flavor
was
full
of
fruit
sweet
malt
and
slight
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
that
felt
very
nice
on
the
palate
and
was
extremely
drinkable
refreshing
and
smooth
a
definite
must
try
for
anyone
this
is
the
second
st
bernadus
beer
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
first
impressions
on
the
pour
beautiful
golden
color
and
lots
of
activity
from
the
carbonation
plus
a
big
thick
and
creamy
head
based
on
appearance
alone
this
brew
would
receive
a
standing
ovation
from
me
the
smell
disappoints
a
little
as
it
is
almost
completely
ether
with
only
little
hidden
fruitcitrus
it
tastes
wonderfully
malty
and
crisp
with
a
nice
dry
finish
ive
come
to
associate
with
these
incredible
abbey
brews
perfectly
balanced
mouthfeel
creamy
and
light
at
the
same
time
on
the
way
out
of
your
mouth
the
beer
leaves
a
sense
of
fruit
maybe
even
a
little
caramel
and
the
wonderful
sweetness
of
the
tripel
style
beer
overall
a
great
beer
that
is
deserving
of
the
title
abbey
ale
i
think
st
bernardus
could
be
paired
with
cheeses
for
an
experimental
jaunt
into
beerfood
pairings
perhaps
manchego
or
romano
feels
lovely
in
the
mouth
for
me
perfect
balance
of
creaminess
with
carbonation
for
this
style
drinkability
is
also
very
high
to
get
a
5
it
would
need
to
have
the
sweetness
tidied
up
just
a
touch
in
the
aftertaste
d
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
but
as
is
the
case
with
tripels
beware
the
8
alcohol
m
d
this
tripel
had
pleasant
flavors
and
was
drinkable
but
the
co2
level
was
overexuberant
and
rough
which
scoured
the
palate
negatively
affecting
the
mouthfeel
notes
nice
tripel
that
is
big
and
fruity
but
also
well
balanced
a
very
solid
offering
from
a
very
good
brewery
definitely
worth
trying
d
i
wasnt
really
impressed
my
first
experiences
with
a
tripel
so
maybe
i
tried
the
wrong
one
good
beer
can
hold
its
own
among
its
belgian
triple
cousins
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
rich
not
nearly
as
nice
as
westmalle
tripel
but
still
good
and
full
taste
is
sweet
and
rich
with
tons
of
spiciness
drinkability
takes
a
hit
due
to
floaties
st
bernardus
always
impresses
i
dont
have
that
much
to
say
about
it
besides
it
is
fantastic
this
one
gets
a
fair
amount
of
hype
and
i
like
this
style
so
i
wanted
to
try
it
so
this
being
pa
of
course
i
had
to
shell
out
about
a
gazillion
s
for
a
case
frankly
a
little
disappointing
for
the
money
but
i
think
my
expectations
were
a
little
high
a
typical
tripel
with
a
big
head
flavorful
fruity
hides
the
etoh
fairly
well
if
i
had
to
do
it
again
id
get
a
case
of
la
fin
du
monde
for
about
60
of
the
cost
d
if
only
all
of
st
bernarduss
stuff
didnt
do
this
to
me
then
i
would
be
happy
maybe
ill
have
to
try
one
of
the
750s
but
if
that
does
this
ill
be
extremely
unhappy
honestly
whats
probably
a
great
tripel
ended
up
being
a
drainpour
highly
drinkable
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
tripel
that
ive
had
this
is
a
tasty
drink
worthy
of
sips
and
chugs
all
night
long
overall
impression
one
of
the
best
tripels
out
there
even
rere
liked
this
one
ill
be
drinking
this
one
quite
often
mediumthick
mouthfeel
wellcarbonated
and
very
drinkable
a
delicious
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
up
until
now
chimay
cinq
cents
had
all
i
ever
wanted
from
a
tripel
today
the
jolly
monk
pictured
on
the
st
bernardus
bottles
blew
my
mind
buy
consume
contemplate
be
at
peace
that
is
all
this
beer
pours
great
golden
honey
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
and
fine
bubbles
aromas
of
banana
citrus
and
honey
the
palate
is
medium
bodied
with
nutty
malty
flavors
with
hints
of
dried
apricots
and
the
bubbles
are
almost
champagne
like
definitely
give
this
beer
a
try
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
guy
definitely
a
great
tripel
to
check
out
i
got
this
one
in
a
four
pack
sampler
of
st
bs
abt
12
triple
pater
6
and
prior
8
with
a
chalice
for
12
bucks
i
was
shocked
there
was
a
three
pack
of
chimays
with
a
chalice
right
next
to
it
for
20
bucks
and
personally
i
think
that
st
bernardus
has
better
stuff
i
love
it
golden
pour
with
a
billowing
three
fingers
of
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
but
it
is
not
bright
tough
to
explain
really
perhaps
if
you
left
out
a
banana
in
the
sun
for
3
hours
it
might
smell
like
this
some
crayon
yeast
and
light
spices
as
well
the
flavor
is
full
of
yeast
and
banana
peel
not
really
as
complex
as
i
expected
but
still
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
the
body
is
light
and
carbonation
levels
are
very
high
but
not
really
prickly
this
one
doesnt
really
standout
for
the
style
but
on
its
own
it
is
a
nice
beer
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
clarity
in
flavor
and
aroma
as
it
stands
its
still
a
solid
beer
though
a
bit
onedimensional
which
isnt
a
phrase
often
used
in
reference
to
st
bernardus
worth
a
shot
now
i
will
finish
this
wonderfull
tripel
light
and
clean
in
flavor
somewhat
candied
vs
the
westmalle
offering
otherwise
brisk
and
fruity
an
easy
drinking
tripel
with
a
nice
texture
on
the
feel
and
a
good
spice
profile
touch
sweet
in
the
end
but
not
nearly
as
are
many
of
the
style
good
balance
the
alcohol
is
covered
up
by
the
taffy
sweetness
making
this
drink
seem
very
notharsh
it
also
has
a
light
refreshing
bent
to
it
like
many
of
the
better
tripels
it
seems
nowhere
near
as
potent
as
it
really
is
which
in
my
mind
correlates
to
a
high
drinkability
score
im
new
to
this
style
but
i
liked
this
a
lot
d
good
not
great
i
expected
more
out
it
and
felt
a
little
let
down
i
cared
for
it
less
and
less
as
it
warmed
and
opened
i
may
retry
later
to
give
it
another
chance
something
may
have
been
off
with
the
palate
possible
spicy
food
early
but
there
is
no
indication
in
my
scribbles
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
moderate
head
quickly
fades
into
a
hazy
golden
body
leaving
thin
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
lovely
aroma
consists
mainly
of
some
banana
apricot
and
sweet
malts
taste
upon
warming
is
malty
sweet
slight
clove
some
mild
citrus
mild
hops
juicy
and
just
plain
delicious
one
of
the
benchmarks
by
which
all
tripels
should
be
measured
insane
masking
of
abv
cant
taste
one
bit
of
it
awesome
brew
in
every
way
shape
and
form
the
beer
is
sharp
on
the
tip
giving
a
feel
of
tartness
the
warmth
from
the
alocohol
is
worth
savouring
and
accentuates
the
spicy
notes
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
not
a
very
complex
tasting
beer
but
has
great
depth
before
you
know
it
it
will
be
gone
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
tripel
and
im
very
keenly
looking
out
for
the
abt
12
d
i
could
probably
drink
a
4
pack
of
these
quickly
and
easily
which
is
bad
since
its
14
99
for
a
4
pack
o
vanilla
manipulates
taste
very
strongly
less
would
be
better
excellent
dessert
beer
but
is
not
good
in
many
circumstances
not
the
kind
of
tripel
i
prefer
d
this
is
an
immensely
palatable
tripel
drinkability
very
nice
and
malty
tripel
that
is
good
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
sipper
i
do
want
drink
it
again
but
not
immediately
afterward
due
to
the
complexity
d
very
high
refreshing
wouldnt
have
minded
a
750ml
bottle
will
pour
a
five
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
hazy
pale
amber
color
honey
and
fruit
nose
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor
is
light
honey
yeast
and
pear
nice
triple
higher
abv
is
hidden
17
00
for
a
gift
pak
of
four
330ml
bottles
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
d
deceptively
light
in
taste
and
small
in
bottle
serving
this
beer
is
soothing
going
down
the
throat
if
it
was
free
flowing
i
couldprobably
drink
quite
a
bit
before
i
realized
i
was
getting
blitzed
even
the
burps
from
this
beer
are
pretty
tasty
update
this
one
has
grown
on
me
since
my
first
tasting
over
3
years
ago
and
has
now
become
a
regular
staple
in
my
household
the
missus
loves
it
and
i
now
agree
i
dont
know
if
it
has
changed
or
i
have
probably
the
latter
i
find
myself
drinking
tripels
quite
a
bit
these
days
and
i
never
refrigerate
them
this
one
i
just
crack
open
and
pour
straight
from
the
cellar
into
a
tulip
glass
a
classic
tripel
and
probably
the
best
from
st
bernadus
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
medium
white
head
smells
strongly
of
pear
and
alcohol
taste
is
light
grain
up
front
a
spicy
yeast
strain
in
the
middle
and
a
hint
of
tartness
in
the
finish
very
little
appearance
of
alcohol
which
is
nice
as
it
can
be
apparant
in
many
tripels
mouthfeel
is
mindbogglingly
smooth
low
carbonation
very
rich
good
drinkability
this
isnt
as
good
as
some
tripels
i
have
had
but
it
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
d
this
is
a
fantastic
triple
i
think
the
best
one
i
have
tried
in
recent
memory
maybe
of
all
time
just
another
fantastic
brew
from
st
bernardus
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
d
this
one
is
an
excellent
sipper
worthy
of
the
price
but
it
does
hit
the
wallet
kind
of
hard
at
5
for
an
11
2
oz
bottle
out
of
all
the
tripels
ive
had
only
a
few
have
been
below
average
out
of
all
the
tripels
that
originate
from
belgium
this
one
is
in
the
top
five
so
far
along
with
westmalle
tripel
karmeliet
affligem
and
la
fin
du
monde
this
ones
from
canada
actually
chimay
and
golden
carolus
are
just
behind
these
five
each
of
these
brews
all
offer
subtle
variances
of
the
tripel
style
so
all
are
worthy
to
try
really
good
beer
better
than
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
and
again
it
goes
down
well
and
then
has
a
great
aftertaste
it
stands
up
as
one
of
the
better
tripels
i
have
had
you
really
notice
the
balance
in
this
tripel
against
most
of
the
other
tripels
on
the
market
drinkability
this
is
reasonably
drinkable
and
id
not
turn
down
a
chance
at
another
one
that
being
said
while
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
tripel
i
had
expected
more
based
on
the
reviews
i
read
before
purchasing
it
i
actually
prefer
the
watou
triple
from
the
same
brewery
a
very
easy
drinking
tripel
taste
fruity
malty
flavor
with
only
a
slight
alcoholic
taste
in
the
background
pretty
sweet
but
not
a
normal
strong
sweetness
it
is
a
nice
fruity
sweetness
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
a
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
strong
of
belgian
yeast
with
orange
apple
and
white
grapes
the
taste
is
unmistakable
belgian
again
with
apples
and
white
grapes
being
the
leaders
of
the
fruity
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
high
in
carbonation
which
is
just
right
for
the
style
when
they
wrote
the
book
on
begian
tripel
this
is
definatly
a
standard
pours
a
dirty
blonde
hefe
type
color
there
is
a
small
one
finger
white
lace
that
disipates
after
a
few
minutes
there
is
a
small
amount
of
cling
to
the
glass
i
am
getting
smell
notes
of
fruit
and
subtle
yeast
nothing
that
overpowers
the
taste
is
reminscent
of
the
smell
with
a
strong
presence
of
fruity
flavors
followed
with
a
yeasty
after
taste
not
bad
but
a
beer
taste
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
wheat
beers
a
decent
tasting
beer
that
is
rather
smooth
for
its
abv
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
not
a
bad
offering
from
this
brewery
d
easy
to
finish
and
probably
my
favorite
of
the
4
beers
in
the
gift
set
id
check
this
out
again
and
i
think
it
might
be
something
to
share
with
non
beer
advocates
if
they
appreciate
wheat
beers
st
bernardus
makes
some
world
class
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
its
an
insanely
drinkable
uberfruity
sweet
tripel
that
holds
its
own
with
some
of
the
best
out
there
i
love
this
stuff
poured
into
st
bernardus
goblet
a
cloudy
deep
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
pillowy
white
head
that
retained
well
and
laced
nicely
aroma
is
initially
fruity
lemonorange
and
spicy
with
a
yeastiness
creeping
in
on
the
tail
taste
is
fruity
and
spicy
but
less
defined
than
the
smell
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
carbonation
good
beer
very
enjoyable
and
an
example
of
the
style
im
more
of
a
fan
of
dark
belgian
ales
love
their
abt
12
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
tripel
from
st
bernardus
i
love
this
and
will
buy
it
again
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
especially
for
a
relatively
lower
abv
tripel
i
liked
karmelet
a
wee
bit
more
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
put
this
in
the
same
world
class
d
this
is
another
winner
from
st
bernardus
i
prefer
the
abt
12
over
this
but
it
definitely
is
a
nice
representation
of
a
tripel
mouthfeel
sticky
medium
body
with
a
high
carbonation
level
this
is
a
beer
to
pour
into
an
appropriate
glass
and
savor
for
over
an
hour
which
is
exactly
what
i
did
when
reviewing
it
i
dont
have
a
single
complaint
the
third
of
three
beers
with
glasses
my
wife
gave
me
still
to
come
j
i
was
a
thrown
a
curveball
and
while
this
beer
was
more
than
just
drinkable
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
when
i
bought
it
drinkability
smellability
is
very
high
but
i
really
dont
think
ill
be
going
back
for
this
again
its
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
not
cheap
either
maybe
i
was
too
harsh
i
had
high
expectations
i
guess
pours
hazy
burnt
orange
with
nice
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
cloves
bananas
and
spice
first
sip
mirrors
the
aroma
great
clean
taste
of
fruits
and
spices
followed
my
a
nice
sugar
sweetness
this
is
a
great
tripel
will
be
even
better
on
a
warm
summer
day
has
a
great
smooth
clean
mouthfeel
this
is
an
oustanding
example
of
this
style
bought
it
at
the
local
slga
to
my
surprise
would
defiantly
buy
again
if
available
reasonable
price

pours
a
gorgeous
bright
honey
color
with
lots
and
lots
of
carbonation
capped
with
a
bonewhite
finebubbled
head
that
deposits
loads
of
lacing
on
the
glass
thats
an
easy
five
for
appearance
the
aroma
takes
a
while
to
open
up
but
when
it
does
theres
a
good
dollop
of
orange
yeast
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
honey
simple
but
delicious
similar
on
the
palate
a
little
floral
a
little
fruity
with
orange
spicy
yeast
perhaps
some
honey
sweet
and
nutty
malts
a
faint
breath
of
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
spicy
mildly
bitter
hops
all
of
this
on
top
of
a
lively
full
and
creamy
yet
smooth
body
that
has
a
lightly
chalky
yeast
dryness
this
is
an
amazing
beer
so
flavorful
yet
delicate
complex
and
layered
but
somehow
simple
its
on
the
low
end
of
the
abv
scale
for
a
tripel
but
i
like
it
that
way
because
it
is
so
damn
drinkable
that
one
small
bottle
is
nowhere
near
enough
to
slake
my
thirst
for
this
brew
o
very
solid
beer
and
worthy
of
the
st
bernardus
name
this
beer
is
a
treat
and
an
excellent
benchmark
to
compare
others
against
d
like
the
other
bernardus
beers
this
is
a
great
one
still
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
growing
on
me
poured
a
cloudy
gold
in
goblet
glass
with
great
carbonation
for
a
onefinger
head
that
slowly
dies
and
is
a
constant
along
with
lace
down
the
glass
a
great
orangecitric
smell
along
with
tartness
and
yeast
and
has
hints
of
figs
berries
and
sweet
malts
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
ranges
from
fluffy
sweet
and
smooth
to
sharp
and
sour
started
crisp
with
a
tart
fruit
taste
like
sour
orange
but
passed
smoothly
and
the
sweet
caramel
malt
picks
it
up
and
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
sweet
backbite
other
flavors
include
berries
and
figs
and
hints
of
toffee
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
could
have
all
day
pour
a
yellow
body
with
an
orange
hue
head
is
huge
as
with
most
tripels
and
frothy
and
looks
to
be
bleached
white
nice
looking
black
sediment
sitting
in
the
bottom
aromas
are
subtle
apricots
some
malts
citrus
rum
slightly
sour
and
some
citrus
flavours
are
present
peaches
and
sweet
malts
too
good
finish
is
smooth
and
creamy
alcohol
not
detectable
would
have
liked
stronger
flavour
and
aromas
still
a
good
example
i
had
two
over
the
course
of
3
hours
i
didnt
feel
the
alcohol
but
was
staying
well
hydrated
and
had
a
nice
dinner
of
wiener
schnitzel
with
roasted
potatoes
during
the
first
glass
a
repeat
offender
for
me
bottle
to
glass
when
i
popped
the
top
the
suds
immediately
begin
bubbling
out
even
though
i
was
handling
carefully
it
was
almostly
completely
foam
in
my
glass
again
even
after
gentle
pour
after
settling
down
it
looked
and
smelled
fine
color
of
honey
but
cloudy
some
juicy
fruit
and
bubble
yum
on
the
nose
taste
had
some
cereal
capn
crunch
flavors
hops
are
there
a
bit
but
not
much
pretty
tasty
beer
would
buy
again
i
mentioned
in
the
review
i
would
be
staying
at
the
brewery
well
the
first
beer
i
had
from
the
fridge
in
the
brouwershuys
was
a
triple
and
it
was
poured
for
me
by
no
less
than
hans
depypere
the
owner
of
the
brewery
the
fridge
is
free
to
use
if
you
are
staying
at
the
lovely
appointed
and
furnished
bb
d
overall
a
nice
beer
i
dont
drink
many
tripels
and
this
one
makes
me
want
to
change
that
and
start
drinking
more
my
initial
impression
of
this
beer
was
that
it
is
not
as
good
as
my
two
other
benchmark
tripels
la
fin
du
monde
and
westmalle
i
still
think
that
they
are
a
bit
better
but
this
gets
better
and
better
the
farther
i
go
down
the
glass
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
this
again
d
a
very
good
tripel
very
tasty
and
well
crafted
very
balanced
taste
and
the
alcohol
was
very
masked
for
8
beer
had
average
carbonation
and
was
very
drinkable
this
was
the
first
st
bernardus
i
have
ever
tried
and
im
looking
forward
to
tasting
the
rest
d
a
very
very
good
tripel
not
the
standout
of
its
class
but
definitely
near
the
top
and
very
drinkable
for
its
abv
overall
i
have
to
say
that
i
dont
really
like
triples
until
today
what
a
fantastic
beer
i
would
like
and
will
drink
this
one
again
and
again
d
very
enjoyable
tripel
an
excellent
brew
this
ones
quite
fruity
whereas
the
westmalle
is
a
much
spicier
trappist
tripel
notes
i
found
this
tripel
to
be
just
a
little
ruff
around
the
edges
heavy
and
well
just
a
little
bit
above
average
im
not
sure
if
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
or
maybe
it
could
use
some
more
time
to
condition
in
the
bottle
or
maybe
less
this
is
a
fine
beer
not
great
but
fine
this
brew
is
awesome
a
very
drinkable
brew
has
a
smooth
moothfeel
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
triple
i
have
had
drinkability
i
have
to
say
in
this
current
moment
of
my
beer
life
this
is
probably
the
best
belgian
style
tripel
i
have
ever
had
just
so
balanced
so
complex
and
so
enjoyable
the
ingrediants
are
so
clean
and
you
get
no
sense
of
8
percent
alcohol
what
to
me
i
love
about
this
tripel
is
that
the
spicyness
stops
it
from
getting
to
sweet
like
some
triples
and
keeps
it
balanced
with
beauty
one
i
could
drink
all
nite
and
will
keep
around
the
best
of
anyone
style
isnt
something
to
be
used
lightly
but
to
me
at
the
current
point
this
is
it
try
it
you
wont
be
sorry
pours
a
lightly
hazed
gold
with
a
huge
white
head
that
lays
down
sheets
of
lace
exceptional
for
the
style
sweet
grainy
malt
aroma
with
lots
of
honey
bread
and
citrus
lots
of
honey
in
the
flavour
but
married
to
a
wonderful
yeasty
breadiness
lightly
grainy
with
a
warming
finish
and
a
kiss
of
sweet
citrus
hops
medium
bodied
and
wellcarbonated
in
a
billowing
soft
way
ridiculously
drinkable
and
i
want
another
now
d
quite
drinkable
excellent
beer
and
excellent
triple
once
it
gets
warm
it
changes
a
bit
and
the
alchohol
becomes
more
obvious
but
when
a
little
colder
the
fruit
is
much
more
obvious
not
that
that
is
a
bad
thing
easily
have
2
of
these
and
want
more
well
disguised
beer
drinkability
beautiful
beer
to
sip
over
the
course
of
45
minutes
or
so
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
with
the
overall
alcohol
being
very
well
integrated
dexquisite
though
the
heaviness
may
make
it
a
bit
too
much
at
times
the
taste
is
pear
and
hay
at
first
with
mineral
slightly
raisiny
but
mostly
dry
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
lemon
pulp
but
all
thin
and
dry
with
a
finish
and
aftertaste
of
dry
fruit
candy
without
the
sweetness
this
leaves
it
largely
onedimensionl
and
bland
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
stbernardus
this
one
pours
a
light
caramel
color
dried
fruits
aroma
with
a
great
mix
of
brightness
taste
is
excellent
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
somewhat
heavy
bodied
but
light
enough
on
the
delivery
sweet
fruit
flavors
and
a
hint
of
malts
drinkability
exceptional
mouthfeel
and
taste
is
very
good
despite
abv
could
drink
for
long
periods
as
far
as
drinkability
i
dont
see
any
problem
with
me
drinking
this
whole
bottle
all
by
my
lonesome
a
little
strong
for
an
all
day
beer
but
definitely
a
great
introduction
to
st
b
or
tripels
in
general
the
tatse
is
wonderful
very
smooth
from
start
to
finish
great
notes
of
hops
and
spice
very
drinkable
from
start
to
finish
drinkability
eminently
quaffable
this
is
a
great
triple
im
happy
i
got
to
drink
one
d
heck
yes
this
is
very
reasonably
priced
at
the
store
i
go
to
for
a
very
superior
product
this
one
sure
does
drink
well
every
sip
makes
me
want
to
take
another
its
fairly
strong
but
its
not
overpowering
complex
yet
mellow
good
brew
here
d
delicious
beer
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
1
out
of
the
st
bernardus
six
pack
sampler
poured
into
my
25cl
chimay
goblet
a
nice
golden
orange
with
some
sediment
and
lots
of
carbonation
rising
one
finger
head
that
seems
to
last
for
the
entire
time
the
beer
is
consumed
leaves
great
lacing
down
the
whole
glass
a
coat
of
it
one
of
the
creamiest
looking
heads
i
have
ever
seen
smells
of
light
fruit
raisins
yeast
malts
and
maybe
some
alcohol
get
that
banana
hefe
like
smell
too
tastes
of
light
fruitscitrus
hefe
banana
raisins
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
and
some
malts
mouthfeel
is
great
very
creamy
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
bit
of
alcohol
warming
drinkability
is
good
for
a
belgian
taste
is
surprisingly
refreshing
8
alcohol
can
only
be
sensed
a
little
bit
great
beer
will
have
again
notes
handsdown
the
best
tripel
ive
tried
to
date
imo
it
kicked
westmalles
ass
in
every
way
imaginable
great
beer
750ml
corked
caged
poured
into
a
chalice
it
is
hazy
copper
gold
with
a
rocky
white
head
and
active
carbonation
smells
of
honey
peaches
and
a
slight
medicinal
phenol
tastes
peppery
and
sharp
then
dusky
malt
it
has
a
haylike
flavor
that
is
very
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
slippery
drinkability
is
great
now
excuse
me
while
i
finish
this
typing
is
making
my
beer
foam
up
pale
cream
color
with
hazy
body
and
creamy
offwhite
head
banana
smell
comes
through
first
shortly
followed
by
spice
and
citrus
taste
is
especially
yeasty
with
a
complex
sugary
structure
and
nutmegallspice
sharpness
and
cherry
tanginess
exceptionally
wellbalanced
and
light
witbier
doesnt
finish
like
a
tripel
that
finishes
as
yeasty
as
it
starts
like
biting
into
a
liquid
fried
plantain
yum
d
doesnt
feel
as
stong
as
the
8
0
abv
suggest
so
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
medium
bodied
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
an
overall
crisp
mouthfeel
alcohol
very
well
hidden
not
too
sweet
and
overall
a
very
good
tripel
i
didnt
particularly
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
tasted
a
little
funky
to
me
the
mouthfeel
would
have
made
this
an
easy
to
drink
beer
but
the
flover
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
had
a
bottle
at
the
moan
and
dove
the
drink
had
a
murky
yellowgold
appearance
with
a
slick
lacing
and
patchy
islandlike
head
aromas
were
really
great
cloves
smells
mixed
with
an
apparent
sour
citrus
smell
taste
was
utterly
excellent
had
a
great
vanilla
cream
taste
mixed
with
that
ripe
citrus
taste
mouthfeel
follows
the
taste
quite
complementary
the
smoothcrisp
dichotomy
is
perfect
overall
very
very
good
im
new
to
the
st
bernardus
range
and
can
say
this
and
the
quad
are
some
very
fine
beers
final
thoughts
very
rich
and
delicious
but
still
pretty
light
for
a
strong
belgian
it
is
a
good
staple
for
tripels
if
you
find
this
be
sure
to
pick
it
up
it
immediately
struck
me
as
the
perfect
summer
day
beer
but
this
is
one
to
be
enjoyed
all
year
round
im
not
a
fan
of
the
huge
carbonation
either
even
if
it
is
part
of
the
style
an
all
around
enjoyable
almost
session
type
beer
even
with
an
8
abv
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
tripel
probably
my
favorite
st
bernardus
offering
its
not
necessarily
the
one
i
would
go
seek
out
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
tripel
but
one
i
enjoyed
drinking
and
would
have
again
the
taste
is
quintessential
belgian
tripel
very
representative
of
the
style
there
is
plenty
of
prickly
mouthfeel
belgian
yeastiness
lots
of
delightful
peppery
spices
and
leafy
hop
flavors
in
the
finish
the
mid
section
is
loaded
with
sweet
malts
some
apricot
orange
rind
some
clove
flavors
some
coriander
some
other
spices
that
add
a
bit
of
a
bite
there
is
a
bit
of
an
abv
presence
in
the
mid
section
through
to
the
finish
the
beer
warms
nicely
and
additional
floral
flavors
on
the
palate
come
out
this
is
one
of
those
incredibly
complex
belgian
beers
that
provide
something
slightly
different
with
each
sip
and
really
whet
the
taste
buds
as
it
warms
there
are
some
sourish
notes
towards
the
finish
maybe
a
little
mustiness
on
top
of
the
apricot
and
citrus
there
is
a
bit
of
a
throaty
abv
burn
in
the
finish
so
the
booziness
is
not
entirely
hidden
with
this
beer
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
is
more
of
a
sipping
experience
because
of
the
carbonation
prickly
mouthfeel
and
abv
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
an
exceptional
tripel
d
its
cleanliness
would
entice
one
to
drink
a
good
bunch
of
these
however
the
abv
would
leave
one
on
their
ass
if
they
put
these
back
all
afternoon
i
scored
4
bottles
from
work
at
a
measely
6
a
bottle
im
stashing
two
for
a
a
couple
of
years
to
taste
on
special
occasions
a
true
top
notch
beer
how
im
just
having
my
first
one
ill
never
know
d
even
though
the
alcohol
taste
is
very
apparent
and
there
is
medium
carbonation
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
d
i
really
love
tripels
and
this
one
is
no
exception
a
really
great
beer
that
every
beer
lover
not
just
belgian
beer
lovers
should
try
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
sharp
and
hard
carbonation
golden
color
somewhat
darker
with
a
thick
head
that
seems
to
stick
around
for
a
bit
tons
of
carbonation
come
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
fruity
and
peppery
the
taste
is
quite
spicy
with
the
fruitiness
taking
a
backseat
the
alcohol
is
quite
well
hidden
but
the
spiciness
brings
it
out
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
yet
has
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
there
d
this
could
be
one
of
the
best
tripels
beyond
karmelite
that
i
have
put
down
to
date
as
stated
above
i
have
enjoyed
the
belgian
strong
ale
dubbel
and
quad
but
i
think
this
may
be
their
best
effort
the
ability
to
taste
both
spectrums
of
the
ph
levels
of
sweet
and
tart
is
the
mark
of
learned
breweres
indeed
many
thanks
brouwerij
st
bernardus
so
this
is
my
favorite
accessible
from
the
oc
beer
at
the
moment
just
finished
one
off
with
some
cheese
and
crackers
what
a
great
way
to
start
the
weekend
overall
review
100
was
not
a
disappointment
although
the
carbonation
has
died
down
considerably
theres
still
enough
left
to
help
create
a
crisp
prickly
yet
clean
and
medium
body
drink
fairly
easy
drinking
tripel
another
solid
brew
from
the
guys
at
st
bernardus
this
is
one
of
the
most
unusual
complex
and
tasty
brews
ive
enjoyed
to
date
though
a
high
abv
keeps
the
drinker
in
check
notes
trippels
arent
my
cup
of
tea
too
much
spice
this
one
however
offered
a
good
balance
of
all
the
required
elements
and
really
was
enjoyable
well
done
d
i
want
to
take
in
copious
amounts
of
this
brew
with
huge
gulps
its
amazingly
good
slides
right
down
the
throat
provides
the
perfect
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
and
has
absolutely
no
hint
of
alcohol
st
bernardus
tripel
has
provided
me
with
one
of
those
few
amazing
moments
along
the
great
journey
a
little
disappointed
in
the
appearance
after
all
the
great
things
ive
heard
about
st
bernardus
still
this
is
an
excellent
brew
challenging
to
define
yet
very
pleasant
in
the
moment
4
5
d
very
drinkable
but
for
the
price
id
take
other
stuff
d
easier
than
others
but
still
a
sipper
all
in
all
a
good
tripple
not
great
but
solid
a
delicious
tripletripel
especially
as
the
fruit
esters
add
a
sweet
delicate
fruitiness
that
nicely
compliments
the
assortment
of
spices
and
the
grainy
malt
character
i
enjoyed
the
st
bernie
tripel
but
i
must
say
it
probably
falls
a
close
second
to
la
fin
du
monde
as
my
tripletripel
of
choice
at
present
nonetheless
this
is
quite
a
worthy
belgian
trappist
ale
and
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
to
anyone
seeking
out
exemplary
belgian
beers
truly
a
great
tripel
overall
a
very
drinkable
triple
the
appearance
kept
this
one
back
a
bit
overall
but
the
rest
of
the
experience
was
a
pleasure
one
ill
be
getting
again
for
sure
recommended
this
is
a
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
it
is
going
on
my
list
as
a
must
have
on
hand
so
refreshing
it
could
almost
be
a
lawnmower
beer
but
not
at
8
but
when
you
are
done
relaxing
on
your
deck
this
is
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
drinkability
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
most
triples
this
lower
bodied
beer
coupled
with
the
excellent
complex
flavor
makes
this
beer
very
drinkabile
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
as
to
the
taste
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
having
just
days
earlier
tried
the
karmeliet
still
judged
strictly
on
its
own
merits
this
was
a
rather
drinkable
tripel
that
id
be
happy
to
imbibe
in
the
future
well
carbonated
and
fruity
with
some
spice
but
not
enough
for
my
taste
i
think
if
anything
the
mouthfeel
was
too
comfortable
and
not
really
a
tasting
challenge
d
definitely
moving
through
this
one
good
one
watch
out
for
the
abv
4
5
m4
5
d
medbodied
quite
fluffy
on
the
palate
and
pretty
soft
overall
and
i
wonder
where
the
alc
is
gone
this
is
a
good
quality
wellbalanced
and
yet
moderatelyflavoured
tripel
with
plenty
of
yeasty
elements
to
entertain
the
palate
and
nose
its
less
fruity
and
sweet
on
the
palate
than
on
the
aroma
and
thats
a
good
thing
to
me
another
solid
abbey
ale
and
be
warned
it
is
highly
quaffable
drinkability
beware
the
good
stuff
overall
well
worth
the
price
for
a
onceinawhile
treat
on
my
budget
good
easter
day
beer
for
sure
would
drink
it
again
but
i
still
love
the
abt
12
should
have
maybe
saved
that
for
last
drinkability
is
better
than
any
of
the
others
of
this
style
ive
enjoyed
i
think
this
bottle
will
be
gone
much
too
quickly
for
my
sobrietys
own
good
d
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
the
alcohol
barely
noticeable
d
good
drinkability
as
with
most
i
want
this
on
tap
d
flavorful
and
smooth
for
a
tripel
disguises
the
alcohol
well
d
goes
down
easily
overall
a
nice
experience
my
first
tripel
and
a
good
one
it
seems
to
me
the
taste
is
smooth
and
subtle
milder
than
westmalle
tripel
or
la
fin
du
monde
but
all
the
right
parts
are
there
for
you
to
enjoy
while
this
wasnt
my
all
time
favorite
the
first
time
around
its
still
a
very
high
quality
beer
i
have
another
bottle
that
ill
open
soon
and
enjoy
if
you
like
your
tripels
with
strong
flavor
maybe
this
isnt
for
you
but
its
going
to
please
a
lot
of
people
medium
bodied
brew
little
bit
of
alcohol
noticeable
but
very
drinkable
but
you
must
take
it
slow
with
this
one
as
it
seems
to
kind
of
creep
up
on
you
after
a
few
great
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
will
be
drinking
it
again
as
well
as
ageing
a
couple
in
the
future
mfd
medium
bodied
crisp
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
dispite
the
8
abv
m
silky
thin
bodied
but
not
watery
this
poured
a
hazy
gold
color
with
fluffy
white
head
it
smelled
like
wild
belgian
yeast
and
lemon
hops
with
earthy
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
cashew
and
alcohol
and
bitter
chocolate
it
tasted
like
wild
but
creamy
yeast
and
salty
caramel
and
confectioners
sugar
with
lemon
hops
and
a
bit
of
white
grapes
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
had
a
smooth
sour
and
sweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
surprisingly
good
tripels
usually
arent
my
thing
but
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
it
had
a
fantastically
clean
and
delicate
flavor
and
good
body
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
too
strong
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
better
to
sip
by
far
the
best
tripel
ive
had
taste
a
little
bready
honey
and
caramelized
pears
can
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
very
drinkable
i
love
it
if
i
could
afford
it
i
would
be
drinking
this
every
night
no
matter
how
many
times
i
revisit
them
ive
never
been
won
over
by
either
st
bernardus
tripels
this
or
the
watou
tripel
i
just
havent
tasted
the
spicy
summery
fruity
effervescence
that
i
love
about
tripels
this
is
still
a
pleasurable
thing
to
drink
nonetheless
and
i
wouldnt
veer
anyone
away
from
trying
it
but
for
me
personally
ill
probably
stick
to
westmalle
and
karmeliet
for
my
tripels
and
leave
st
bernardus
to
the
dubbels
and
quads
m
not
overly
gassy
this
beer
was
well
done
all
in
all
a
very
successful
evening
d
drinkable
with
an
interesting
complex
flavor
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
tripel
very
good
beer
that
is
not
boring
and
has
a
mildly
complex
taste
very
drinkable
a
bit
different
recipe
than
other
trappist
and
very
good
depends
on
what
one
likes
from
this
style
mouthfeeldrinkability
i
loved
this
beer
very
well
balanced
in
taste
and
flavor
light
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
may
have
some
good
flavors
to
it
but
i
could
not
tell
over
the
alcohol
notes
this
is
one
fruity
tripel
very
pleasant
flavors
all
wrapped
up
in
a
nice
tight
package
nothing
overplays
its
hand
and
all
the
flavors
work
to
counterbalance
each
other
wellbuilt
complex
and
very
easily
drinkable
nicely
done
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
d
the
same
carbonation
bite
on
the
mouthfeel
results
in
a
very
filling
beer
the
abv
is
beyond
that
of
a
normal
session
beer
but
probably
well
within
the
limits
of
a
tripel
flavors
are
not
so
aggressive
to
make
this
an
undrinkable
beer
drinkability
surprisingly
light
for
a
big
abv
beer
more
than
a
couple
would
take
their
toll
a
price
id
be
willing
to
pay
if
i
had
that
many
around
overall
perhaps
the
best
representation
of
the
style
d
a
very
nice
tripel
that
lives
up
to
its
reviews
im
glad
i
grabbed
it
pours
a
golden
yellowred
color
extremely
fizzy
very
clear
looking
big
big
head
slightly
offwhite
lasting
extremely
floral
aroma
dark
fruit
similar
aroma
to
allagash
triple
one
of
my
favorites
very
floral
taste
dark
fruit
sweet
not
thick
sightly
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
floral
aftertaste
similar
in
almost
every
way
to
allagash
triple
creamy
and
mildly
sweet
the
finish
is
more
sour
than
sweet
the
body
is
thinner
than
most
tripels
and
the
carbonation
is
near
the
level
of
soda
the
alcohol
presence
is
not
overwhelming
which
i
like
overall
this
is
an
easy
tripel
to
enjoy
medium
body
good
carbonation
d
average
this
is
a
good
intro
to
belgians
i
think
its
not
over
powering
with
the
complex
flavors
but
its
still
got
the
asic
taste
very
nice
d
i
could
probably
handle
two
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
some
floaties
suspended
in
the
beer
foamy
white
head
fades
slowly
into
a
nice
14
layer
atop
the
beer
some
spottyclingy
lacing
on
the
glass
some
tropical
fruit
aromas
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
bean
and
a
slightly
bracing
whiff
of
alcohol
sort
of
a
dulled
pear
flavor
some
green
apple
flesh
really
subdued
spicy
on
the
lips
and
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
mediumbodied
slightly
creamy
some
lingering
fruitinessspiciness
i
think
this
would
be
much
better
with
a
plate
of
food
beside
it
on
its
own
its
not
wowing
me
d
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
that
doesnt
go
overboard
with
the
abv
at
8
this
is
a
tripel
that
i
can
have
a
few
of
and
not
worry
about
paying
the
price
later
highly
recommended
well
done
beer
d
tastes
best
as
it
warms
and
goes
down
relatively
easy
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
carbonation
keeping
it
lively
a
great
tripel
with
a
very
wellbalanced
flavor
this
beer
pours
amber
orange
with
an
offwhite
soapy
head
that
leaves
a
great
deal
of
lacing
im
drinking
out
of
a
st
bernardus
goblet
and
that
just
makes
it
all
the
prettier
the
glass
is
great
by
the
way
almost
an
oversized
wine
glass
the
head
is
wonderfully
belgian
this
beer
has
its
share
of
delicate
funky
yeast
the
flavor
is
a
careful
balance
of
bitterness
and
earthiness
there
are
some
good
sweet
malt
notes
lurking
in
the
background
and
i
wish
that
they
were
a
touch
stronger
or
richer
or
something
but
i
guess
thats
not
the
way
of
most
belgians
its
a
very
good
beer
and
evinces
a
great
deal
of
craftsmanship
i
always
feel
a
little
wanting
when
i
love
a
brewerys
quad
and
then
try
the
tripel
i
just
cant
push
those
scores
higher
knowing
what
st
bernardus
can
do
with
that
12
d
incredibly
spicy
zesty
and
well
rounded
drank
like
a
dream
and
probably
one
of
the
best
per
style
ive
tasted
after
getting
over
the
initial
appearance
this
was
a
quite
good
beer
i
could
easily
enjoy
one
but
there
are
a
lot
of
good
beers
out
there
and
will
likely
only
have
another
if
someone
else
purchases
it
saved
the
best
for
last
this
weekend
dark
gold
with
a
swisscheese
looking
white
head
expected
spice
and
yeast
but
more
apple
and
fruits
effervescent
mouthfeel
musty
yeast
and
dry
fruity
tartness
blend
well
with
the
nutmeglike
sweetness
a
very
good
beer
d
a
very
drinkable
tripel
especially
for
those
who
like
them
sweet
enjoyable
and
not
overly
alcoholladen
although
more
than
one
would
be
tough
due
to
the
sweetness
an
excellent
tripel
save
for
the
shit
appearance
that
kind
of
ruined
it
easily
one
of
the
best
overall
tasting
ones
that
ive
had
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
poured
gently
into
chalice
a
cloudy
pour
with
less
than
1
finger
of
head
this
is
how
i
prefer
it
more
head
would
have
been
easily
obtained
a
light
amberdark
yellow
color
very
attractive
with
nice
lacing
very
pleasant
welcoming
aroma
the
taste
is
pleasantly
bold
without
being
overpowering
as
you
work
through
the
glass
the
fruit
flavors
become
more
apparent
full
enveloping
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
you
could
settle
in
with
nice
assortment
of
meats
and
cheeses
and
drink
several
of
these
very
easily
d
tripels
are
not
my
favorite
at
all
but
like
i
mentioned
above
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
it
may
encourage
me
to
try
others
most
of
the
tripels
i
have
had
have
not
been
nearly
as
complex
as
this
example
seemingly
relying
on
alcohol
content
alone
i
will
try
more
but
for
now
if
i
am
reaching
for
a
tripel
it
will
be
this
one
poured
a
very
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
fairly
cloudy
haze
the
head
is
massive
hard
to
pour
correctly
unless
you
go
super
slow
the
head
is
fluffy
and
super
light
incredible
lacing
on
the
glass
and
crazy
rockiness
to
the
head
as
it
lowers
the
smell
is
typical
of
an
awesome
pale
belgian
hints
of
apples
apple
ciderjuice
belgians
spices
and
pepperiness
the
flavor
is
sweet
fruity
and
peppery
the
light
peppery
hop
flavor
is
no
challenge
to
the
malty
sweetness
the
warmer
it
gets
the
maltier
it
tastes
the
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
tingly
from
the
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
great
belgian
pale
an
absolute
breeze
to
drink
this
is
a
lush
and
complex
tripel
that
really
satisfies
the
soul
this
is
a
terrific
beer
from
a
great
brewery
dont
pass
up
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
if
you
happen
upon
it
poured
this
darker
golden
amber
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
gave
a
huge
amount
of
head
to
start
with
then
reduced
to
a
plentiful
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
that
of
spice
and
smell
of
the
alcohol
however
the
taste
was
profound
in
greatness
at
it
gave
a
cinnimon
and
caramel
taste
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
future
outlook
eh
hard
to
say
decent
but
uninspiring
imo
so
i
wont
soon
seek
it
out
again
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
fine
example
of
the
style
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
must
md
light
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
high
abv
doesnt
deter
the
drinker
at
all
maybe
just
because
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
just
so
damn
good
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
makes
a
good
intro
beer
to
belgian
beer
virgins
not
only
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
but
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
brews
altogether
st
bernardus
stands
as
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
aroma
of
white
fruits
such
as
apple
grape
and
pear
also
strong
alcohol
and
spice
presence
pretty
carbonated
at
first
but
becomes
intense
as
it
warms
nice
balance
of
fruitines
maltiness
alcohol
and
slight
hops
very
crisp
enjoyable
tripel
very
drinkable
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
belgians
but
i
could
just
keep
drinking
this
and
so
can
my
dog
apparently
i
spilled
a
little
on
the
floor
and
she
hasnt
stopped
licking
the
spot
maybe
i
should
share
the
wealth
solid
brew
get
it
and
drink
it
d
really
nice
tripel
it
goes
down
almost
too
easy
definite
repurchase
in
the
future
drinkability
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
tripels
but
im
a
fan
of
this
tripel
very
enjoyable
d
pretty
near
perfect
as
she
warms
in
your
glass
she
gets
better
this
follows
the
style
closely
not
something
i
am
crazy
about
but
good
if
you
like
tripels
this
is
a
must
try
pours
a
nice
light
orange
amber
with
a
finger
sized
offwhite
head
nice
spicyness
belgian
aroma
light
orange
raisin
and
a
bit
of
caramel
a
bit
of
alcohol
but
not
too
bad
nice
sweetness
very
good
carbonation
as
it
dances
along
the
tounge
very
dangerously
drinkable
d
drinkable
yet
dont
really
care
for
this
brand
of
tripel
wondering
why
others
like
this
beer
so
much
several
improvements
could
be
made
in
the
appearance
taste
and
mouthfeel
to
be
made
into
a
more
drinkable
beer
notes
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
after
having
had
the
abt
12
twice
before
and
i
was
not
dissapointed
great
beer
this
is
really
something
beautiful
looking
amber
rather
crisp
clear
with
a
healthy
head
not
much
lace
but
consistent
with
each
mix
of
the
glass
i
have
never
really
comprehended
the
grace
in
the
smell
of
a
triple
they
all
seems
just
like
cotton
candy
to
me
this
was
different
a
very
complex
relationship
between
the
malt
the
belgian
sugar
cane
and
the
alcohol
made
the
alcohol
very
well
placed
the
malt
cane
and
hop
gave
off
a
floral
complex
sweetness
the
menu
at
hopleaf
stated
a
fragrance
of
rosewater
it
was
quite
gentle
had
a
delicate
sweet
to
it
and
a
very
mild
citrus
the
malt
gave
it
body
and
a
bland
flower
petal
nature
the
smell
carries
over
into
something
close
to
a
honeysuckle
flower
picked
and
eaten
whole
the
sugar
was
subtle
but
delicately
complex
banana
apple
plum
a
light
crisp
hop
finish
excellent
feel
to
the
last
drop
really
a
great
example
of
the
use
of
belgian
sugar
cane
a
must
try
had
it
again
and
had
determined
that
freshness
really
put
an
edge
on
this
one
seems
gilded
in
sugar
as
it
over
ripes
pours
out
a
pale
tan
color
like
a
summer
wheat
field
fluffy
head
that
drops
to
nothing
very
rapidly
and
leaves
just
a
ring
where
the
head
and
beer
once
met
smells
of
farmhouse
spices
and
tastes
as
good
as
a
french
hill
side
it
manages
to
be
light
and
chewy
at
the
same
time
a
wonderful
balance
at
8abv
im
not
sure
how
drinkable
it
is
but
i
dont
think
ill
have
any
trouble
with
the
750
this
drinks
extremely
well
very
clean
and
bright
with
deep
grain
heartiness
alcohol
is
quite
hidden
a
classic
effort
750ml
bottle
had
to
use
a
wrench
to
get
the
cork
out
gave
a
nice
pop
carefully
poured
this
one
into
a
westmalle
chalice
slowly
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
yeast
in
there
golden

creamier
as
it
warms
booze

wellhidden
when
cold
becomes
much
more
apparent
as
it
warms
a
great
tripel
but
probably
not
my
favorite
its
definitely
worth
the
money
to
pick
up
a
single
750
rather
than
a
4pack
i
think
i
still
prefer
tripel
karmeliet
however
drinkability
a
very
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
tripel
i
initially
gave
it
lower
ratings
across
the
board
but
it
got
better
and
better
as
the
session
progressed
wish
i
had
another
one
actually
very
creamy
and
fluffydelicate
tastes
well
balanced

25
4oz
bottle
d
this
beer
for
being
such
a
big
beautiful
style
goes
down
incredibly
easy
no
trace
of
abv
in
my
opinion
the
flavors
and
scents
are
great
and
the
appearance
is
just
freaking
amazing
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
beer
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
an
even
bigger
fan
of
st
bernardus
a
great
brewery
that
always
comes
through
with
a
fine
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
great
beer
that
highlights
most
of
my
favorite
aspects
of
belgians
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
i
love
tripels
but
this
didnt
quite
stack
up
with
the
best
tripels
ive
ever
had
its
still
a
fine
beer
and
far
above
average
feels
good
on
the
palate
quite
thick
and
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
quite
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
tripel
m
d
most
tripels
i
have
had
were
very
complex
and
lent
themselves
to
slow
thoughtful
drinking
but
this
beer
while
still
being
complex
was
very
smooth
its
8
abv
is
hidden
well
and
one
could
easily
gulp
this
down
if
one
was
a
hasty
sort
that
is
very
good
and
glad
i
tried
it
the
alcohol
is
there
but
its
not
overpowering
the
carbonation
is
slight
but
is
noticeable
i
could
drink
many
of
these
but
i
would
be
in
trouble
afterwards
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
these
i
love
drinking
it
it
is
so
choice
if
you
have
the
means
i
highly
recomend
picking
some
up
update
just
had
this
beer
again
how
amazing
it
is
to
get
a
beer
of
this
quality
at
your
local
bevmo
im
so
glad
to
see
the
awesome
reviews
on
this
site
what
a
treat
more
memorable
than
their
quad
imo
d
easy
going
despite
8
abv
im
reviewing
a
330ml
which
is
enough
to
leave
me
content
though
ive
had
the
750ml
before
and
it
went
down
just
as
easy
overall
a
good
pick
i
tried
some
belgian
ales
about
5
years
ago
at
that
time
i
totally
disrespected
beer
i
tried
to
chug
any
that
was
put
in
front
of
me
in
order
to
become
intoxicated
needless
to
say
i
was
greatly
missing
out
on
the
enjoyment
of
beers
such
as
this
one
must
sip
a
belgian
tripel
to
enjoy
the
complexities
and
find
all
the
little
subtleties
therein
i
am
so
glad
that
i
started
respecting
beer
and
was
able
to
discover
a
new
world
of
good
beer
such
as
this
one
thank
you
beer
advocate
a
beer
that
truly
needs
decanting
their
were
plenty
of
little
chunks
of
yeast
floating
around
an
amber
nectar
the
head
is
a
bit
pathetic
a
thin
film
of
foam
that
one
expects
from
mass
produced
lagers
however
for
such
a
small
head
it
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
the
first
smell
is
that
bready
yeast
smell
considering
the
amount
of
yeast
decanted
its
no
surprise
a
bit
of
apricots
and
oranges
plenty
of
warming
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
pepper
as
well
tastes
almost
as
good
as
it
smells
lots
of
malts
bit
of
fruit
bit
of
pepper
all
well
balanced
with
one
flavour
not
overpowering
the
other
very
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
that
coats
and
gives
a
pleasant
numbness
to
the
throat
a
beer
that
can
be
nursed
for
hours
its
no
secret
how
good
this
beer
is
this
review
just
confirms
it
to
me
definitely
in
the
upper
class
of
its
style
overall
surprisingly
pleasant
worth
a
try
taken
from
notes
poured
into
a
snifter
at
ebenezers
in
july
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
light
malt
sweetness
and
some
candied
sugar
tastes
like
a
tripel
should
nice
spice
up
front
with
a
sweet
sweet
malt
backbone
lots
of
spice
very
very
drinkable
i
love
tripels
and
this
may
be
my
fave
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
you
could
call
it
tan
brown
orange
yellow
golden
flat
out
murky
and
i
dont
think
any
answer
is
wrong
very
thick
foamy
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
subtle
hints
of
fruit
spice
and
yeast
in
the
aroma
but
nothing
thatll
just
jump
out
at
you
a
very
nice
blend
of
citrus
spice
malt
with
a
nice
little
alcohol
presence
in
the
flavor
a
little
tang
and
tart
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
which
is
surely
a
sign
of
the
alcohol
content
while
you
know
youre
drinking
alcohol
it
is
balanced
quite
well
i
like
it
pretty
good
a
solid
belgian
beer
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
by
bjcp
guidelines
it
seems
like
a
model
example
drinkability
another
very
good
tripel
from
the
st
bernard
breweryerr
i
mean
brouwerij
though
for
me
when
pit
sidebyside
with
the

do
defer
to
the

at

overall
impression
i
know
this
beer
isnt
hyped
as
much
as
other
tripels
but
its
one
of
the
best
ive
had
not
only
is
it
a
solid
tripel
but
its
just
a
very
solid
beer
in
general
everything
is
pleasantly
balanced
and
proportioned
i
dont
feel
any
aspect
of
this
beer
is
lacking
or
overdone
i
feel
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
representation
of
the
style
overall
an
descent
beer
that
i
might
get
again
clove
caramel
yeast
belgian
spices
candy

herbal
flavors
greenery

round
out
the
flavors
with
good
carbonation
and
a
creamy
middle
honey
comb
peach
white
pepper
and
hints
of
plantain
follow
through
to
the
long
finish
delicious
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
amber
with
lots
of
sediment
in
it
and
a
3
finger
white
head
the
smell
is
of
citrus
with
a
little
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
incredibly
smoother
the
main
flavor
seems
to
come
from
coriander
and
malts
the
flavor
is
mild
on
this
beer
but
very
well
balanced
and
well
crafted
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
especially
well
carbonated
and
very
smooth
a
highly
drinkable
brew
certainly
something
i
would
like
to
kick
back
and
drink
while
watching
a
nice
movie
for
a
tripel
i
was
expecting
something
slightly
heavy
and
bold
but
instead
found
a
lighter
more
flavorful
brew
the
smell
after
pouring
gave
off
a
citrus
aroma
the
head
came
out
big
and
fluffy
and
the
color
was
a
murky
gold
the
taste
was
bold
and
refreshing
colored
by
citrus
and
not
paired
with
a
strong
alcohol
musk
none
of
the
raisin
hints
i
had
come
to
expect
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
still
had
body
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
d
ive
come
to
realised
this
isnt
my
favourite
style
but
this
one
seemed
to
pretty
good
not
very
commonly
available
here
but
something
id
buy
every
now
and
then
to
keep
things
interesting
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
light
orangish
gold
huge
very
persistent
white
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
ridiculous
lacing
aroma
is
very
yeasty
and
earthy
taste
has
a
lot
of
light
malty
sweetness
sweet
citrus
tangy
spicy
and
herbal
oranges
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
intense
but
also
rounded
and
balanced
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
but
not
too
much
so
very
tasty
really
good
and
solid
tripel
overall
get
some
overall
a
great
triple
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
wellbalanced
with
subtle
complexities
this
sips
very
easily
soft
and
succulent
this
is
a
very
drinkable
tripel
that
deviously
hides
its
potent
abv
could
drink
but
might
burp
it
up
for
a
week
d
this
is
hands
down
the
best
tripel
ive
had
why
did
i
wait
this
long
just
want
to
say
thanks
to
mr
moneyman
for
my
two
bottles
much
appreciated
interesting
brew
some
honey
and
belgian
honeycomb
blocks
of
caramel
is
a
tasty
little
morsel
never
wear
sunglasses
at
night
would
have
to
say
this
is
a
very
mellow
trippel
maybe
to
much
for
some
overall
impression
very
complex
beer
with
a
lot
of
good
flavors
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
definitely
a
great
example
of
the
style
if
not
the
definitive
example
pours
a
cloudy
dirty
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
head
smells
of
apples
and
other
fruit
tastes
of
apples
a
bit
of
lemon
lime
honey
and
who
knows
what
problem
is
theres
just
not
that
much
flavor
therewhat
there
is
is
pretty
weak
almost
like
you
took
duvel
and
diluted
it
with
30
water
its
drinkable
in
the
way
that
a
light
summer
beer
would
be
but
the
flavors
are
so
weak
that
its
not
really
that
complex
d
a
pleasure
to
drink
id
forgotten
how
good
this
tripel
is
almost
too
easy
to
consume
near
the
top
of
its
class
stylewise
and
certainly
one
to
seek
out
i
know
well
be
buying
more
sooner
rather
than
later
d
delicious
slightly
intimidating
complexity
but
a
very
enjoyable
drink
at
8
you
have
to
be
careful
not
to
have
too
many
a
pleasing
drink
but
i
prefer
the
abt
12
a
great
tripel
d
this
is
a
great
triple
definitely
a
must
have
if
youve
never
tried
it
on
tap
at
track
84
in
warwick
ri
pours
deep
orangegold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
citrus
caramel
and
hops
taste
much
the
same
with
strong
notes
of
bread
and
yeast
spicy
on
the
finish
very
nice
tripel
this
is
a
staple
of
mine
on
tap
done
was
enough
probably
wont
try
again
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
i
had
high
expectations
and
i
feel
that
theyve
been
met
its
not
quite
as
superb
as
the
abt
12
but
its
no
slacker
a
slightly
smoother
mouthfeel
would
probably
make
it
just
as
good
keep
in
mind
im
nitpicking
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
recommended
st
bernardus
tripel
pours
a
golden
peachish
orange
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
the
smell
is
good
medium
to
strong
with
malt
and
fruit
like
aromas
its
taste
is
good
and
unique
sporting
a
crisp
floral
like
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
medium
carbonation
the
carbonation
gives
a
kind
of
airy
bubbly
feel
overall
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
really
good
it
packs
a
good
subltle
kick
with
a
well
blended
taste
and
smooth
feel
i
found
it
to
get
better
at
mid
glass
but
still
it
was
nice
the
whole
way
through
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
style
i
like
this
one
better
than
the
abt
12
recommend
d
very
drinkable
the
balance
was
amazing
no
worries
on
this
one
at
all
a
truly
wonderful
brew
poured
a
nice
dark
golden
color
with
a
big
time
white
and
frothy
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
around
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
strong
on
candy
sugar
malt
belgian
fruits
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
with
a
lot
of
the
malt
character
and
a
little
grain
mouth
feel
was
very
creamy
and
smooth
i
kind
of
like
this
a
little
more
than
most
triples
but
i
love
the
dubbel
and
the
quad
a
little
more
pours
a
cloudy
apple
cider
like
color
with
a
smaller
white
head
smell
is
very
good
has
a
wonderful
strong
yeast
aroma
lots
of
sweet
malt
and
fruits
and
spices
taste
is
very
good
has
a
sharp
alcohol
presence
to
it
but
still
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
good
could
be
a
bit
better
but
who
am
i
to
judge
another
great
belgian
love
it
another
fantastic
st
bernardus
brew
drinkabilty
is
very
high
as
this
is
a
damn
good
trippel
tasty
and
complex
enough
to
beget
multiple
glasses
in
order
to
fully
comprehend
the
depth
of
flavor
highly
digestible
its
easy
on
the
belly
not
to
strong
either
very
well
done
all
in
all
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
this
is
all
about
balance
and
knowing
your
craft
in
my
mind
this
is
what
the
art
of
brewing
is
all
about
this
is
world
class
drinkability
notes
a
quality
beer
in
which
you
can
taste
the
craftsman
shift
i
would
love
to
try
off
the
tap
at
the
brewery
not
as
full
and
bold
as
i
expected
and
the
flavors
really
didnt
linger
in
the
mouth
maybe
it
just
tastes
so
good
i
dont
want
it
to
end
all
in
all
a
must
try
deep
golden
in
color
with
a
tinge
of
red
this
poured
a
very
fine
thick
head
that
slowly
dissipated
the
nose
was
filled
with
banana
spice
yeast
and
mineral
in
the
mouth
this
is
mediumbodied
very
wellbalanced
with
an
enticing
mouthfeel
that
has
some
richness
but
is
also
silky
soft
the
flavors
follow
the
nose
which
makes
this
both
a
nice
beer
for
the
summer
due
to
the
flavors
and
the
winter
with
the
density
very
enjoyable
overall
a
great
beer
would
buy
this
one
again
d
this
is
an
exceptional
tripel
certainly
one
of
the
best
around
d
drinkability
is
good
the
warm
alcohol
brings
this
one
in
to
the
realm
of
sipping
beer
the
complexity
of
the
brew
is
what
makes
you
keep
coming
back
for
more
i
would
have
no
problem
recommending
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
something
in
the
style
of
a
tripel
good
brew
a
dvery
enjoyable
alcohol
is
welldisguised
and
with
how
smoothly
this
one
drinks
go
easy
its
a
hard
call
but
if
anything
i
would
rate
this
ahead
of
westmalle
tripel
one
of
the
great
belgian
beers
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
tried
it
is
great
drunk
straight
out
of
the
fridge
or
at
14
degrees
which
cannot
be
said
for
many
of
the
higher
abv
belgian
offerings
d
a
great
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
again
d
definitely
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
come
across
relatively
high
abv
is
well
hidden
excellent
complexity
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
get
out
of
it
and
enjoy
it
a
tremendous
beer
and
definitely
one
to
seek
out
and
enjoy
d
im
not
getting
much
aftertaste
with
these
triples
which
i
guess
is
normal
outside
of
maybe
duvel
this
is
the
champagne
of
beers
an
excellent
beer
across
the
board
finally
sit
down
to
review
this
fantastic
beer
pours
a
dark
russet
brown
with
a
slight
orange
hue
to
it
lots
of
head
fluffy
and
smooth
some
nice
lacing
too
the
aroma
site
back
a
bit
some
nice
fruits
some
earthiness
and
spices
the
taste
comes
out
much
more
a
bouquet
of
all
things
delicious
the
dark
rich
sugary
fruits
some
citrus
too
the
yeastiness
the
earthy
hops
and
herbal
quality
absolutely
delicious
the
mouth
is
full
smooth
and
delicious
this
is
just
an
absolute
treat
and
a
testament
to
the
celebration
of
the
greatness
of
beer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
grew
on
me
more
and
more
with
each
sip
thick
creamy
body
with
perfect
carbonation
this
is
for
sure
one
of
the
best
triples
around
mouthfeel
is
delicate
but
not
too
thin
great
complexity
while
remaining
drinkable
excellent
a
musttry
notes
excellent
one
of
the
best
tripels
the
perfect
marriage
of
complexity
and
drinkability
overall
a
decent
tripel
though
not
typical
it
is
certainly
drinkable
would
go
nice
with
a
variety
of
food
there
are
certainly
better
tripels
out
there
but
that
shouldnt
deter
anyone
from
trying
this
oh
st
bernardus
how
i
love
you
so
its
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
brewery
and
this
tripel
does
not
disappoint
it
has
a
dark
heavy
appearance
in
the
glass
with
an
initially
foamy
head
the
scent
is
quite
sweet
you
can
really
capture
the
strong
sugar
presence
the
taste
is
exquisite
beginning
with
a
malty
yeasty
fruit
character
and
finishing
with
buttery
toffee
notes
extremely
complicated
beer
that
makes
you
want
to
savor
every
single
sip
perfect
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
as
ive
said
with
other
st
bernardus
beers
the
8
abv
is
well
hidden
under
the
delicious
textures
of
the
beer
phenomenal
unforgettable
beer
enjoy
released
into
the
glass
with
a
slightly
opaque
earlyharvest
orange
birthing
forth
with
a
touch
of
lively
carbonation
the
head
wanes
after
a
minute
or
two
to
well
under
one
fingers
width
light
lacing
that
quickly
sinks
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
to
settle
into
a
sea
of
offwhite
with
fine
bubbles
reflecting
some
of
the
liquids
apricot
glow
refreshing
and
crisp
on
the
nose
this
brew
is
playful
on
my
tongue
and
quite
light
for
its
8
abv
the
alcohol
well
concealed
amidst
summers
slightly
tart
apples
an
excellent
drink
to
be
sure
and
thankful
that
i
have
one
bottle
left
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
pours
a
deep
yellowgold
color
with
a
fairly
decent
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
sweet
fruit
and
whiffs
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
very
clean
very
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
very
well
balanced
a
relatively
lightbodied
tripel
that
is
quite
drinkable
a
fantastic
beer
and
grilled
veggies
drinkability
the
best
tripel
ive
had
yet
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
helps
add
to
the
full
body
of
this
mothers
milk
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
complexity
abv
not
the
best
tripel
out
there
but
pretty
good
i
actually
prefer
st
bernardus
tripel
to
the
abt
12
more
drinkable
and
lighter
being
the
primary
factors
d
for
8
abv
you
can
drink
this
socially
but
why
would
you
want
to
very
smooth
but
this
has
so
much
flavor
that
it
needs
to
be
sipped
and
savored
split
a
bottle
of
this
with
a
buddy
poured
this
into
my
delirium
tremens
snifter
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
bubble
bath
head
that
wasnt
stingy
with
its
lacing
smell
is
a
deliciously
complex
dance
of
citrus
spice
yeast
and
some
corn
taste
is
sweet
like
a
fruity
candy
or
like
fruit
cocktail
pears
and
white
grapes
are
noticeable
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
still
quite
tasty
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
nice
and
light
with
sufficient
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
doesnt
command
as
much
attention
as
the
abt
12
but
is
still
very
enjoyable
taste
has
many
good
flavors
none
of
which
overpower
the
others
nice
sweet
malt
with
soft
spice
and
light
fruitiness
make
up
this
great
tasting
tripel
8
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
making
this
very
drinable
another
great
beer
from
st
bernardus
what
can
i
say
other
than
i
wish
i
had
another
to
follow
this
one
every
beer
fan
must
try
this
luxurious
brew
i
cant
say
its
the
type
i
would
sit
down
and
polish
off
a
four
pack
but
certainly
two
would
do
the
trick
d
this
is
a
nice
light
refreshing
tripel
there
are
others
that
i
enjoy
a
lot
more
but
this
is
still
a
good
one
it
was
great
to
get
to
try
such
a
wellhyped
example
of
this
style
i
will
probably
have
it
againbut
not
too
soon
because
it
is
so
expensive
overall
man
do
i
love
the
monks
i
often
miss
church
but
when
drinking
these
beers
i
am
as
close
to
god
as
one
can
be
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
triples
known
to
man
sweet
fruits
mingled
with
yeast
thanks
to
the
monks
at
st
bernardus
for
doing
what
they
do
one
of
my
favorite
st
bernardus
brews
so
far
i
rate
it
up
there
with
there
abt
12
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
an
average
size
offwhite
head
with
excellent
lacing
as
all
st
bernardus
brews
seem
to
have
another
trademark
of
the
monastery
are
the
complex
aromas
of
there
brews
this
one
has
pine
lemon
chocolate
dough
apple
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
banana
very
sweet
smelling
taste
is
clean
with
sweet
start
and
mild
bitter
finish
soft
carbonation
and
an
alcoholic
finish
make
this
beer
a
favorite
in
my
book
my
favorite
tripel
i
can
drink
this
but
i
wont
make
a
conscious
decision
to
buy
it
again
the
dubbel
is
a
much
better
more
balanced
beer
imo
poured
into
my
large
tulip
with
a
deep
golden
hue
the
fluffy
white
head
dissipating
quickly
wonderful
intertwining
smells
of
belgian
yeast
and
candied
sugar
give
way
to
faint
alcohol
tones
nowhere
near
what
youd
expect
out
of
a
8
beer
the
taste
mimicked
the
nose
fairly
well
in
addition
to
the
sweet
malt
backbone
that
trails
off
into
a
slightly
tart
fruity
finish
the
mouth
feel
was
fairly
substantial
and
drinking
more
than
a
750
at
a
time
might
be
a
stretch
this
beer
pairs
great
with
spanish
manchego
and
portsalut
cheese
as
garrett
oliver
suggests
triples
go
very
well
with
pesto
dishes
and
this
one
is
no
different
enjoy
high
alcohol
and
maybe
the
lack
of
sweetness
have
something
to
do
with
it
but
it
is
not
highly
quaffable
imo
d
this
is
so
damn
easy
to
drink
i
finished
this
way
before
i
completed
this
review
so
simple
yet
complex
at
the
same
time
an
honor
to
drink
an
awesome
tripel
though
i
need
to
slow
down
as
this
one
is
14
gone
in
about
5
minutes
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
abbey
style
tripel
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
it
i
kept
coming
back
to
that
alcohol
taste
although
it
wasnt
overbearing
it
was
still
present
of
course
the
more
of
this
stuff
you
drink
the
less
you
are
going
to
notice
something
like
that
but
as
far
as
my
own
personal
enjoyability
there
are
others
that
i
would
choose
first
either
way
this
one
deserves
a
solid
score
on
my
scale
its
one
of
those
that
is
so
close
overall
world
class
hands
down
i
am
sooo
happy
that
i
have
access
to
this
beer
now
thanks
to
barbara
at
tbc
a
very
good
tripel
this
didnt
blow
me
away
like
the
abt
12
but
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
this
was
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
that
id
love
to
try
again
and
share
with
friends
another
worldclass
topnotch
sample
from
st
bernardus
my
second
brew
from
the
company
and
i
am
still
very
very
impressed
amazing
stuff
worthy
of
the
highst
praise
exceptional
appearance
with
a
dark
cloudy
hazy
look
with
incredible
frothy
foamy
lingering
head
smell
was
wonderful
full
of
freshfruit
grapefruit
and
pears
aboveandbeyond
taste
without
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
or
bitterness
full
of
yeast
fresh
flowers
citrus
lemons
and
thick
rich
vanilla
awesome
mouthfeel
that
was
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
surprisingly
easy
and
lucid
drinkability
that
went
down
crystalclear
for
a
brew
with
a
hefty
8
abv
no
alcohol
detected
just
rich
thick
creamy
flavors
that
stand
out
and
beg
recognition
a
worldclass
brew
absolutely
recommended
excellent
authentic
deptiction
of
the
style
d
it
might
be
easy
to
think
of
another
when
starting
but
the
abv
is
a
little
higher
not
a
friendly
innocent
lager
so
it
needs
to
be
taken
slow
sit
back
relax
let
the
experience
last
the
yeast
carbonation
last
in
the
mouth
creating
an
exciting
finish
a
great
sipping
brew
i
find
new
qualities
with
each
tasting
d
this
one
is
so
smooth
and
great
tasting
you
could
easily
knock
this
one
down
in
no
time
very
attrative
gold
body
with
bubbly
head
that
slowly
thins
to
a
film
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
smells
sweet
and
slightly
musty
with
an
hint
of
flowers
sweet
slightly
fruity
with
candied
sugar
if
and
a
nice
citrus
aftertaste
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
bitterness
light
bodied
very
dry
texture
pleasant
and
very
drinkable
this
is
not
a
style
i
drink
often
but
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
id
never
had
a
tripel
before
this
one
so
i
dont
have
much
context
for
comparison
from
what
ive
read
i
think
i
got
a
beer
that
wasnt
so
fresh
the
color
was
more
brownish
than
anything
else
with
what
looked
like
sediment
floating
around
the
smell
was
decent
and
subtle
the
taste
was
very
odd
while
it
was
dry
enough
it
lacked
the
pop
thats
particular
to
st
bernardus
beers
it
wasnt
totally
undrinkable
but
i
do
think
i
got
a
beer
that
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
awhile
courtesy
of
total
wine
i
might
give
this
one
another
shot
this
is
a
great
tripel
again
a
little
drier
than
i
think
id
usually
prefer
but
definitely
something
id
have
again
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
just
a
treat
pours
a
cloudy
and
calming
orange
into
a
snifter
has
a
fluffy
white
onefinger
head
with
decent
retention
finally
leaving
a
little
ring
of
lacing
all
around
creamy
and
somewhat
bready
malts
float
up
to
the
nose
just
before
the
grapes
and
bananas
reveal
themselves
smell
is
perfection
tastes
of
oranges
subtle
lemons
and
faint
spice
with
some
breadiness
mixed
in
and
a
very
slight
bit
of
syrup
left
on
the
lips
alcohol
lurks
in
the
background
along
with
some
esters
both
are
almost
unnoticeable
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
i
am
going
out
on
a
limb
here
and
say
its
refreshing
which
is
quite
an
accomplishment
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
that
being
said
i
will
treat
it
with
respect
theres
a
damn
good
reason
the
monk
on
the
label
is
smiling
from
ear
to
ear
and
i
am
already
looking
forward
to
my
next
bottle
of
this
fantastic
brew
d
very
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
great
beer
to
stick
with
for
a
whole
evening
delicious
and
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
if
not
my
favorite
ever
notes
the
pronounced
harsh
flavors
i
experienced
in
this
beer
can
perhaps
be
due
to
a
bad
bottle
a
damn
fine
tripel
one
of
the
best
tripels
that
ive
had
pours
cloudy
burnt
orange
to
slightly
amber
in
color
with
a
thinly
laced
even
head
in
a
0
3
liter
ayinger
celebrator
glass
the
head
was
thick
and
full
with
the
tiniest
of
bubbles
and
subsided
rather
quickly
leaving
little
if
any
lacing
nose
is
slight
with
hints
of
fruit
apple
in
particular
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
with
a
light
citric
tingle
taste
is
difficult
to
describe
it
isnt
heavy
and
you
cannot
notice
the
alcohol
again
i
taste
the
same
apple
and
orange
or
lemony
hints
i
mentioned
on
the
nose
and
mouthfeel
very
refreshing
tripel
and
quite
enjoyable
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
to
be
sure
normally
when
i
see
a
beer
reviewed
so
much
with
such
a
high
score
i
approach
with
trepidation
this
one
did
deliver
though
and
i
am
glad
to
have
been
able
to
grab
a
bottle
when
i
was
in
the
bay
area
this
was
my
first
tripel
and
third
st
bernardus
offering
i
am
quickly
gaining
respect
for
how
tasty
and
amazingly
complex
belgian
beers
can
be
i
will
greatly
enjoy
trying
to
figure
this
one
out
again
in
the
future
overall
this
was
an
excellent
example
of
a
triple
i
had
a
gusher
with
this
one
as
i
have
had
in
the
past
that
is
really
all
that
i
can
fault
this
beer
as
it
is
a
really
great
beer
12
oz
bottle
poured
hazy
orange
little
white
head
that
turns
to
some
lace
belgium
yeast
fruit
and
malt
aroma
clean
mouth
feel
some
light
carbonation
the
taste
on
this
one
is
lightly
sweet
malty
fruity
start
slightly
hoppy
bitter
finish
not
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
but
good
non
the
less
quite
drinkable
and
i
do
recommend
it
for
the
style
for
sure
d
i
dont
know
how
to
feel
about
this
one
i
did
tripels
but
i
feel
like
westmalle
had
more
to
offer
me
thats
the
one
i
would
reach
for
time
and
again
it
comes
out
a
nice
goldenyellow
with
a
fairly
thick
head
be
careful
opening
it
when
i
opened
the
bottle
it
foamed
like
an
everloving
geyser
aroma
is
strong
malty
yeasty
wheaty
flavor
is
rather
like
a
good
hefeweissen
maltywheaty
with
an
undertone
of
citrus
finish
is
smooth
and
has
just
a
hint
of
hops
another
winner
from
them
monks
in
spite
of
the
high
abv
this
is
quite
drinkable
as
with
all
of
the
st
bernardus
beers
i
have
tried
to
date
i
am
very
impressed
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
am
ranking
this
beer
up
there
with
just
about
all
of
the
st
bs
and
i
will
be
going
back
for
more
those
monks
sure
know
what
they
are
doing
i
can
say
that
for
them
d
a
hearty
brew
yet
the
flavors
are
still
subtle
not
sessionable
but
ill
seek
it
out
frequently
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
easytodrink
tripel
enjoy
one
when
you
can
d
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
even
though
im
not
a
huge
belgian
fan
this
tripel
really
does
it
for
me
it
takes
a
belgian
yeasty
taste
that
turns
me
off
to
quite
a
few
other
beers
and
makes
it
so
enticing
its
hard
to
put
down
brouwerij
st
bernardus
has
never
let
me
down
ive
enjoyed
each
and
every
one
of
their
creations
and
am
especially
thrilled
with
tripel
its
on
my
short
list
of
the
worlds
best
beers
no
matter
the
style
i
plan
to
stock
up
whenever
the
opportunity
presents
itself
only
next
time
im
going
for
the
750s
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
doughy
body
but
does
not
seem
over
filling
nice
carbonation
tickle
a
very
good
tripel
drinkability
is
good
balanced
nice
depth
right
on
for
the
style
this
is
a
fine
tripel
and
i
look
forward
to
finding
more
of
it
overall
i
found
this
one
supper
enjoyable
it
maybe
isnt
as
over
the
top
as
many
of
the
extreme
beers
but
its
full
of
flavor
and
makes
for
a
great
drinking
beer
i
could
enjoy
this
one
over
and
over
again
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
amazing
no
doubt
both
are
helped
by
the
careful
use
of
the
candy
sugar
this
was
finished
too
fast
i
highly
recommend
this
tripel
only
the
nose
was
disappointing
but
everything
else
was
great
another
solid
offering
from
st
bernardus
a
much
more
impressive
beer
this
time
around
it
was
a
touch
on
the
thick
side
for
the
style
but
there
was
a
great
range
of
phenols
i
mean
this
beer
was
spicy
damn
there
were
also
mellow
banana
and
subtle
clove
matched
with
a
sizeable
hops
bite
of
herbal
lemon
and
citrus
rind
yum
very
tasty
but
i
might
have
trouble
drinking
a
few
of
these
perhaps
not
spectacular
but
a
very
nice
beer
nonetheless
a
true
treat
personal
score
94100
top
notch
like
the
other
st
bernardus
brews
try
it
i
have
only
previously
tried
the
abt
12
and
i
didnt
see
what
the
fuss
was
however
this
is
a
different
beast
i
love
a
good
tripel
but
this
one
pushes
the
envelope
with
a
distinct

easy
a
great
beer
i
enjoyed
after
spending
the
day
moving
a
great
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
reminiscent
to
me
of
much
darker
heartier
beers
like
a
good
porter
it
does
not
taste
at
all
like
a
porter
mind
you
but
it
fills
the
mouth
with
a
creamy
fullness
that
reminded
me
of
porter
the
taste
evolves
in
the
mouth
moving
forward
to
the
tip
of
the
tongue
i
opened
my
large
bottle
right
out
of
the
refrigerator
a
sin
i
know
and
was
greeted
by
a
taste
somewhat
sharper
than
the
fuller
flavor
of
the
warmer
second
half
do
yourself
a
favor
allow
this
beer
to
develop
its
full
potential
at
a
cool
not
cold
temperature
i
definitely
prefer
this
to

but
maybe
its
a

this

a

that

hits
the
palate
at

but
this
is
a
great
example
of
the

this

if

with

certainly
not

a

on

its

this

there

enjoyable
offering
a
very
sturdy
take
on
the
belgian
tripel
from
a
brewery
who
has
yet
to
really
miss
for
me
this
is
a
very
clear
and
amber
tinted
colored
version
in
some
ways
lighter
clarity
and
in
some
ways
more
grainy
darker
than
others
nice
off
white
head
holds
in
my
glass
and
leaves
spider
web
lacing
as
i
drink
on
it
its
got
a
weird
nose
for
the
style
though
a
bit
of
burnt
sugar
but
also
a
funny
staleness
not
the
typical
green
bottle
skunk
but
something
else
an
almost
german
dusty
grain
element
thats
unfamilar
in
belgian
beer
to
me
and
isnt
all
the
way
appealing
but
not
enough
to
turn
me
off
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
great
though
long
sweet
but
smooth
grainy
front
end
some
oats
in
here
lend
body
while
the
majority
wheat
malt
does
more
of
the
flavoring
the
yeast
is
subtle
in
this
too
not
as
belgian
as
other
belgians
less
fruity
esters
maybe
fermented
at
a
lower
temperature
but
the
strain
appears
active
enough
to
eat
through
most
of
the
sugar
here
and
the
finish
is
dryer
than
many
tripels
on
the
market
carbonation
is
there
but
its
not
quite
effervescent
and
the
added
body
from
the
slightly
heavier
grains
make
it
drink
a
little
heavier
than
it
really
needs
to
although
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
and
not
a
factor
in
lesser
drinkability
at
all
i
think
i
like
their
quad
better
and
i
definitely
like
their
wild
version
of
this
better
but
its
a
nice
take
on
the
style
o
this
totally
tastes
like
something
else
ive
had
many
times
before

well
made

i
e
chimay

if
you
like
tripels
and
youre

definitely
give
this
one
a
try
a
nice
hazy
orange
with

looks
flat
at

not
much
for

a
nice
light
slightly

triple
taste
the
alcohol
nips
rather
than
bites
does
have
a
gentle
fizz
in

mouth
and
goes
down
very
smooth
poured
an
orangish
golden
body
with
one
finger
head
that
left
minor

on

of
a
yeasty
citrusy
orange
aroma
complete
with
some
sharp
spice
and
a
hint
of
candi
sugar
and
breadlike
malt
first
impressions
on
my
tongue
are
that
this
beer
has
both
a
grainy
crackerbready
malt
base
and
a
sharp
carbonation
and
touch
of
pepper
to
it
which
leads
to
a
somewhat
chewey
mediumbodied
beer
that
finishes
with
a
snap
touches
of
sugary
sweetness
give
minor
counterpoint
not
exactly
balance
tropical
pineapple
or
pear
something
along
those
lines
and
citric
orange
fruit
notes
good
balance
nice
flavors
not
my
favorite
but
its
not
watery
or
rip
or
anything
negative
o
this
is
a
bit
sugary
but
not
much
of
the
classic
tripel
yeast
profile
that
is
hard
to
capture
but
delicious
there
alcohol
and
fizz
with
some
sweetness
makes
it
ok
to
drink
but
nothing
special
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
slowly
and
savor
with
a
nice
pastry
fries
or
maybe
mussels
c
notes
a
malty
trippel
that
isnt
spicy
but
is
complex
interesting
and
floralorangey
apparently
the
bottle
has
a
bit
more
bitter
to
it
on
tap
its
a
tad
more
mellow
and
sweet
so
might
be
worthwhile
to
have
a
try
from
the
bottle
as
well
o
really
like
the
balance
in
this
beer
a
little
sticky
in
sugar
but
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
nice
example
for
a
belgium
tripel
comes
across
a
bit
robust
for
the
style
has
a
lot
of
flavour
but
doesnt
work
as
well
as
some
others
ive
tried
i
would
still
recommend
this
as
a
very
good
beer
it
works
pretty
well
d
really
drinkable
the
alcohol
stays
pretty
well
hidden
and
the
flavors
are
interesting
yet
easy
to
move
through
i
will
be
buying
this
again
medium
to
full
body
average
carbonation
and
very
dry
on
the

very
well
done
tripel
will
not
replace
st
bernardus
but
still
a
worthy
contender
was
a
touch
crackery
with
some
candi
sweetness
a
little
more
tropical
fruit
was
present
here
which
segued
into
a
dry
peppery
finish
quite
nice
this
really
hit
the
spot
prosit

o
very
drinkable
an
excellent
belgian
tripel
specimens
with
strong
personality
overall
pretty
solid
and
it
does
have
a
nice
menthol
action
to
it
on
the
finish
o
this
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
has
its
alcohol
surprisingly
well

on

with

this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of

with

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with

good
stuff
o
overall
crisp
clean
and
very
easy
to
consume
and
forget
this
is

that
feels
and
drinks
almost
like
a
session
in
the
beginning
enjoyable
triple
with
a
hidden
alcohol
that
makes
for
easy
generous
sips
not
overly
spicy
overly
inundated
with
alcohol
just
a
very
good
example
of
a
cleanly
brewed
and
well
crafted
triple
that
many
will
overlook
in
their
pursuit
of
the
next
bigger
bolder
thing
the
alcohol
will
catch
up
with
you
in
the
end
but
youll
enjoy
the
ride
getting
there
crazy
smooth
drinkability
even
with
all
those
yeasty
chunks
o
an
alright
tripel
it
needs
a
crisper
body
and
more
depth
but
its
still
solid
od
a
solid
tripel
especially
if
you
lean
towards
the
dry
and
clean
side
not
as
sweet
as
todays
modern
tripels
which
makes
me
think
this
goes
back
to
the
age
where
these
beers
were
a
little
more
wild
and
more
attenuated
maybe
not
clean
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
was
full
but
not
heavy
taste
was
complex
fruit
layered
with
malt
and
hops
a
very
smooth
brew
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
bitter
this
was
one
of
the

a

with

is
quite

with
just
the
right
carbonation
definitely
a
fine
brew
overall
quite
an
interesting
and
charming
beer
highly
satisfying
quite
unique
worth
seeking
out
o
very
nice
and
easily
drinkable
nice
representation
for
the
style
jd
o
this
is
a
nice
tripel
that
hits
all
the
high
points
of
the
style
out
of
the
bottle
i
found
it
to
be
slightly
too
prickly
and
bubbly
to
really
be
a
knockout
but
it
is
a
very
good
tripel
nonetheless
overall
after
an
absence
of
a
decade
i
may
have
built
up
straffe
hendrik
in
my
mind
a
little
bit
its
still
a
very
good
triple
but
not
the
mind
blowing
beer
i
remember
from
brugges
perhaps
my
palette
has
matured
in
any
case
a
happy
walk
down
memory
lane
nice
silky
mouthfeel
with
appropriate
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
bit
above
average
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
bit
high
at
9
abv
for
an
afternoon
sipper
but
its
hidden
well
well
made
just
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
the
beer
had
a
medium
feel
to
it
with
great
carbonation
the
beer
was
clean
crisp
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
straffe
hendriks
tripel
pours
a
totally
clear
dark
orange
its
a
little
dark
for
the
style
and
it
has
a
bone
colored
head
that
maxes
out
at
about
four
fingers
in
height
head
retention
is
pretty
good
but
aside
from
a
near
solid
ring
at
the
top
of
the
glass
lacing
is
very
spotty
the
nose
is
disappointingly
weak
but
there
are
some
classic
tripel
elements
presence
a
sweet
pale
fruit
aroma
primarily
apricots
by
far
dominates
and
its
supported
by
a
surprisingly
potent
earthy
herbal
hop
smell
spiceclove
phenols
are
barely
there
the
flavor
starts
out
just
like
the
nose
big
apricotfruit
and
a
little
bit
of
candy
sweetness
the
mid
palate
bitterness
is
a
little
bit
sharper
than
i
would
have
anticipated
but
still
keeps
itself
in
check
noble
hop
influence
is
a
little
bit
less
intense
here
leaving
a
little
more
room
for
the
phenols
to
shine
through
the
mouthfeel
is
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
the
body
is
light
yet
creamy
and
the
carbonation
is
effervescent
and
lively
straffe
hendriks
tripel
is
a
decent
beer
but
im
pretty
confident
i
could
find
a
tripel
i
prefer
to
this
one
on
the
shelves
of
most
decent
bottle
shops
o
i
think
i
have
to
finish
the
4
pack
to
know
more
i
will
write
more
later
i
like
it
pours
translucent
gold
with
a
lot
of

huge
foam
that
has
staying
power
nose
reminds
me
of
yeastbready
banana
bread
holiday

and
pineapple

at
a
hawaiian
buffet
palate
offers
plenty
of
pineapple
tartness
wheatymalty
backbone
and
a
chewy
yeastyness
all
through
till
the
finish
also
has
a
musty
female
pheromone
sort
of
mustiness
to
it
in
a
good
way
smile
o
a
solid
triple
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
lacking
in
the
flavor
depth
i
was
expecting
for
the
price
its
sleek
and
classic
impressive
in
being
able
to
match
its
own
alcoholic
strength

at
whole

overall
tasty
and
drinkable
this
beers
flaws
are
more
in
appearance
than
anything
else
i
would
have
this
again
though
o
very
easy
to
drink
also
very
refreshing
after
a
long
night
at
work
easy
pour
with
a
decent
head
straw
coloring
but
almost
no
aroma
a
slightly
more
biting
taste
of
hops
than
most
light
belgians
but
not
overwhelming
at
all
the
flavor
isnt
too
impressive
for
the
style
but
i
was
surprised
that
i
didnt
detect
the
level
of
alcohol
present
o
great
belgian
tripel
but
on
the
outside
looking
in
when
youre
talking
about
the
best
in
the
style
still
this
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
and
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
this
magnificent
brew
nice
summer
tripel
thats
not
too
heavy
ill
continue
to
drink
it
year
round
though
cheers
a
worthy
effort
amber
golden
color
minimal
head
not
many
bubbles
present
aromas
of
caramel
and
booze
the
taste
is
full
bodied
but
lacking
complexity
very
one
dimensional
flavors
of
dried
fruit
and
honey
teddy
grahams
the
finish
kind
of
just
creeps
up
there
is
no
progression
of
flavors
just
sweet
malt
and
a
warmth
from
the
booze
mouthfeel
is
slightly
rich
slick
ok
at
best
not
a
favorite
definitely
in
the
raw
and
it
shows
though
stays
well
within
the
style
a
good
pick
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
decent
tripel
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
one
of
my
favorites
by
any
means
it
is
too
underattenuated
for
the
style
and
it
lacks
the
necessary
crispness
that
this
beer
requires
that
said
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
and
it
you
call
it
a
quad
it
is
fine
for
fans
of
the
sweeter
style
of
tripels
you
can
do
no
wrong
here
checking
this
bad
boy
out
a
nice
little
beer
but
certainly
not
among
my
favorite
tripels
ever
glad
i
tried
it
this
could
be
a
really
dangerous
fallback
in
the
stable
of
tripels
a
lovely
tripel
that
posesses
a
rich
yet
subtle
flavour
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
with
dinner
and
i
concluded
that
it
went
well
with
food
not
an
everyday
beer
but
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
tripel
i
dug
this
alot
easier
drinking
than
some
very
smooth
fruit
and
toast
balance
is
great
i
got
the
last
bottle
and
am
glad
i
did
draft
at
fire
works
arlington
d
average
at
best
my
first
experience
was
with
a
fresh
330ml
bottle
the
younger
smaller
format
suited
me
much
better
and
was
nothing
short
of
impressive
this
bottle
was
practically
forgetable
a
pretty
good
tripel
personally
i
find
the
high
carbonation
a
little
offputting
as
it
masks
a
lot
of
the
initial
taste
but
that
is
to
be
expected
with
this
style
of
beer
so
its
more
of
a
personal
opinion
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
but
its
not
unpleasant
drinkability
wonderfully
complex
and
goodtasting
brew
very
interesting
all
the
way
from
looking
at
the
bottle
to
the
last
sip
i
enjoyed
this
one
if
blindfolded
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
a
darker
beer
very
smooth
will
be
a
great
summer
beer
too
mouthfeeldrinkability

it
goes

really
easy
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
gold
with
about
one
finger
of
white
head
that
settles
into
a
foamy
collar
predominantly
sweet
aromas
with
strong
notes
of
bubblegum
honey
and
baked
pastries
not
unlike
baklava
all
of
these
notes
carry
over
to
the
flavor
where
they
are
intensified
lingers
long
and
sweet
a
nice
dessert
id
like
to
like
more
tripels
but
there
are
so
few
that
dont
look
like
crap
and
taste
like
old
lemonade
this
is
not
one
of
those
but
it
might
not
satisfy
the
principled
tripel
purist
way
to
sweet
of
a
beer
it
really
gets
quite
cloying
and
isnt
something
i
want
to
finish
a
glass
of
the
aroma
on
this
beer
wasnt
actually
half
bad
and
had
me
hoping
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
decent
beer
not
a
tripel
that
goes
for
the
jugular
but
also
nice
to
know
you
wont
be
getting
an
instant
headache
either
i
love
a
good
tripel
but
theyre
beastly
things
sometimes
an
easy
pleasurable
uncomplicated
beer
that
drinks
like
any
number
of
other
quality
belgians
just
not
a
tripel
for
newbies
as
it
will
definitely
give
the
wrong
impression
a
nice
malty
brew
it
has
plenty
of
clove
flavor
a
jolly
tripel
to
drink
a
bit
expensive
compared
to
other
in
its
class
however
tripel
lovers
shouldnt
shy
away
from
putting
this
on
their
list
to
try
warming
rich
light
effervescence
and
fullbodied
very
good
drinkability
this
was
a
nice
easy
drinker
but
not
the
heavyhitting
tripel
that
i
had
hoped
for
the
drinkability
is
good
it
drinks
like
beer
with
ahalf
its
abv
overall
it
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
its
very
good
tripel
with
something
a
little
different
to
offer
due
to
its
uncharacteristic
malt
profile
more
alcohol
than
the
smell
indicatesthis
warms
the
throat
in
the
swallow
light
hop
lots
of
light
belgian
yeast
thinner
than
most
tripels
but
the
lower
carbonation
seems
to
make
this
one
work
this
ended
up
being
a
very
good
apertif
before
dinner
in
bruges
can
wait
to
try
it
again
for
a
rereview
pours
an
almost
clear
goldenamber
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
goes
down
rather
quickly
in
the
nose
i
get
some
fruitiness
mostly
pears
and
melons
i
also
get
a
bit
of
banana
and
spice
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
pear
and
spice
flavor
to
it
with
a
banana
taste
following
the
alcohol
is
amazingly
wellhidden
in
this
beer
i
cant
even
taste
it
at
all
theres
a
lot
of
cantaloupe
and
honeydew
flavor
to
this
triple
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
it
was
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
triple
the
drinkability
is
a
lot
higher
than
i
was
expecting
although
i
find
most
triples
to
be
very
drinkable
due
to
its
abv
solid
beer
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
belgium
just
makes
really
good
beer
even
if
its
not
trappist
o
a
very
nice
tripel
this
one
has
a
little
more
bitterness
than
others
but
is
an
overall
good
beer
overall
a
unique
take
on
the
style
worth
trying
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
it
was
certainly
worth
a
try
d
drinking
it
at
the
ba
brandy
hunahpu
event
shockingly
this
ends
up
as
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
brews
of
the
substantial
day
surprisingly
good
a
good
tripel
that
fares
much
better
than
most
but
a
few
nuances
keep
it
from
being
world
class
drinkability
not
sure
what
a
brugse
tripel
is
supposed
to
taste
like
but
the
brewery
claims
this
is
the
last
authentic
example
really
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
is
only
ok
here
but
cold
this
one
could
go
down
quickly
and
with
a
lot
of
volume
drinkability
is
good
drink
this
at
the
brewery
in
bruges
if
given
the
chance
d
a
nice
tripel
i
enjoyed
the
fruitiness
of
it
and
that
although
it
did
have
sweetness
its
not
syrupy
and
maintained
that
dry
finish
d
slightly
above
average
in
the
drinkability
department
the
metallic
aromas
and
flavors
will
keep
me
from
having
another
glass
body
is
about
average
maybe
a
little
full
for
the
style
alcohol
well
hidden
except
for
a
prick
towards
the
end
i
dont
quite
love
the
ester
fruitiness
that
takes
over
and
it
starts
to
taste
more
and
more
like
old
banana
as
it
warms
drinkable
but
not
elite
belgian
beer
here
drink
ends
sweetly
leaving
you
wanting
more
but
possibly
too
sweet
which
can
also
be
a
little
turn
off
drinkability
a
tasty
brew
that
drinks
remarkably
easy
despite
its
supposed
9
abv
all
in
all
its
a
very
delightful
heck
even
picturesque
example
of
a
tripel
this
a
wonderful
representation
of
the
tripel
style
very
easy
to
drink
and
agreeable
with
nothing
off
about
it
if
you
like
this
style
at
all
do
yourself
a
favor
and
give
this
a
try
very
smooth
light
flavor
and
mouthfeel
sour
and
bitter
yeasty
finish
with
a
good
belgian
character
the
yeast
flavor
is
the
most
dominant
thing
in
this
beer
and
i
am
glad
they
really
let
the
malt
and
hops
play
a
light
background
role
to
a
very
drinkable
tripel
the
drinkability
is
awesome
this
brew
has
sugars
and
spices
and
is
very
tasty
i
love
the
smell
of
bananas
as
i
sip
this
awesome
brew
where
is
the
9
dangerous
d
at
9
its
a
bit
too
drinkable
if
you
get
my
drift
i
could
drink
this
all
the
way
to
the
hospital
yum
able
to
drink
this
one
too
quickly
could
be
a
killer
if
i
was
prone
to
drink
more
than
1
or
2
at
a
sitting
the
milder
flavors
also
enhance
willingness
to
drink
more
be
careful
another
example
of
the
triple
style
that
adds
to
the
belgian
reputation
its
not
exceptional
but
its
decent
enough
to
try
would
i
buy
more
of
it
id
say
yes
especially
to
share
with
friends
as
this
is
a
beer
with
some
history
and
rather
strong
a
very
drinkable
triple
this
beer
assumes
a
place
on
my
list
as
one
of
the
best
tripels
at
9
percent
it
is
getting
to
my
head
but
as
i
drink
it
slowly
in
a
very
pleasant
way
i
like
the
carbonation
but
i
wish
there
was
more
to
the
bottom
the
aftertaste
doesnt
blow
my
socks
off
either
but
its
not
unpleasant
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
can
see
myself
buying
again
biggest
problem
to
me
is
the
fact
that
the
head
dissappears
almost
immediately
d
not
bad
the
sweetness
and
bubblegum
yeast
character
becomes
a
bit
cloying
by
the
end
of
the
glass
nice
peppery
notes
and
malt
character
especially
in
the
finish
drinkable
but
there
are
better
beers
in
belgium
notes
a
nice
tripel
and
my
favorite
beer
from
de
halve
maan
taste
is
malty
with
the
biscuit
malt
offering
complexity
to
the
beer
it
adds
a
grainy
taste
and
maybe
an
extra
maltbitter
kick
which
combines
well
with
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
this
bitterness
comes
through
and
shows
a
clean
bitterness
which
combined
with
the
rather
clean
yeast
profile
steals
the
show
however
the
bitterness
is
starting
to
become
a
little
sharp
with
a
lack
of
real
malt
sweetness
and
where
is
the
alcohol
you
could
have
fouled
me
by
saying
this
beer
is
only
6
medium
and
creamy
body
some
very
limited
alcohol
warming
sensation
overall
the
beer
is
excellent
i
was
told
that
in
the
beer
shop
and
now
i
believe
it
it
is
a
pity
i
have
only
one
bottle
of
this
beer
enjoyable
trippel
from
a
great
brewery
really
enjoyed
the
beer
in
a
22oz
to
start
the
evening
reminded
me
of
great
trippels
in
belgium
nice
foamy
head
aromatic
smell
fresh
out
of
the
tap
but
very
very
sweet
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
the
first
sip
reveals
fine
rolling
carbonation
and
an
average
body
with
sticky
textures
the
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
a
sweet
fruit
hit
of
white
grape
and
wine
with
some
rock
candy
and
sweetness
no
booze
or
hops
anywhere
very
approachable
and
complex
tripel
a
nice
brew
that
i
enjoy
a
lot
and
would
definitely
try
again
a
great
example
of
the
style
that
would
even
be
good
for
newer
folks
to
the
style
nothing
over
the
top
but
well
nuanced
not
a
traditional
tripel
sure
but
a
very
tasty
beer
wouldnt
prefer
this
to
a
chimay
or
a
st
bernardus
but
thats
just
me
this
is
a
very
good
but
not
worldclass
tripel
as
far
as
american
versions
of
this
style
go
however
this
one
does
well
alcohol
warmth
is
a
little
exaggerated
and
the
yeast
is
complex
but
not
particularly
mindblowing
it
relies
on
the
hoppy
spices
a
little
more
than
the
yeast
itself
still
a
great
attempt
but
with
its
more
focused
and
simplified
taste
the
beers
bright
floral
bouquet
chases
the
session
from
start
to
close
making
it
ideal
for
those
who
find
belgian
versions
too
winey
earthy
or
spicy
not
sure
what
the
talc
like
aroma
came
from
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
o
nice
representation
of
a
trippel
but
not

to
style
interesting
o
enjoyable
but
im
not
a
great
judge
for
this
style
overall
this
is
way
too
sweet
and
the
banana
and
cinnamon
flavors
overwhelm
the
taste
buds
as
a
hop
head
id
love
to
see
the
sweetness
balanced
with
more
bitterness
or
at
least
tone
down
the
cinnamon
but
like
i
said
this
style
isnt
for
me
interesting
trippel
when
west
coast
hopheads
and
belgian
yeast
collide
the
new
world
trippel
is
born
a
solid
classic
tripel
not
the
worlds
best
tripel
but
then
again
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
americanbelgians
as
far
as
things
go
its
alright
mo
smoothly
carbonated
but
still
softly
refreshing
this
beer
is
not
so
effervescent
as
in
a
wellcarbonated
belgian
tripel
coming
with
a
mediumish
body
against
a
9
7abv
strength
however
it
drinks
exceptionally
well
and
approachable
not
terribly
wellattenuated
overall
to
me
but
overall
it
has
shown
a
distinctive
take
on
the
style
and
wellcrafted
all
in
all
overall
a
rather
nice
drinking
triple
that
starts
out
drier
and
gets
sweeter
and
boozier
but
also
smoother
more
toward
the
end
it
is
a
rather
nice
brew
overall
and
a
nice
one
to
try
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
tart
in
the
aftertaste
with
some
apricot
kernel
bitterness
sort
of
a
funky
belgian
yeast
flavor
with
the
usual
drying
effect
otherwise
this
is
not
vey
beery
its
some
sort
of
fruitflavored
malt
beverage
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
olive
tree
market
in
ocean
beach
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
mug
pours
a
murky
golden
color
with
noticeable
sediment
and
a
smooth
creamy
white
head
with
very
little
lacing
head
recedes
quickly
but
never
disappears
completely
smell
is
of
bananas
and
alcohol
taste
is
more
of
the
same
bananas
and
other
fruit
in
the
foreground
alcohol
is
present
but
still
masked
well
even
with
a
9
7
abv
only
a
slight
spice
taste
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
with
below
average
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
trippel
but
not
the
best
ive
had
it
couldve
used
a
bit
more
spiceyness
that
you
find
with
other
trippels
o
i
liked
it
just
a
tad
better
on
tap
but
its
still
excellent
out
of
the
bottle
o
one
of
the
better
american
trippels
i
have
had
thankfully
it
doesnt
have
banana
and
bubblegum
flavors
othis
tripel
misses
the
mark
the
taste
was
too
heavy
on
the
fruit
sugar
and
alcohol
and
i
missed
that
funky
grassy
spicy
earthy
kick
that
a
great
tripel
provides
on
the
other
hand
my
wife
who
is
a
tripellover
loved
it
i
will
give
credit
for
a
nice
mouthfeel
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dull
orange
with
suspended
fine
sediment
one
finger
thick
white
colored
foam
that
settles
to
a
thin
ring
but
leaves
a
thick
sheet
of
lace
for
the
first
couple
of
inches
smell
pale
malt
sweetness
fruity
nectarine
white
grape
juice
hopping
is
moderately
spicy
and
lightly
herbal
and
earthy
taste
upfront
its
spicy
with
the
suggestion
of
lemon
peel
then
a
blast
of
sugary
pale
malt
white
grape
lots
of
soft
apple
the
yeast
promotes
the
fruit
flavors
but
its
not
exactly
running
wild
the
feel
is
pillowy
cut
by
syrupy
equals
chewy
mediumplus
bodied
finishing
sweet
sticky
and
semidry
enjoyable
but
im
not
likely
to
grab
one
again
soon
o
i
really
liked
this
one
it
goes
down
very
easy
for
a
nearly
10
abv
a
nice
twist
on
a
trippel
pales
in
comparison
to
the
true
belgian
examples
of
the
style
this
is
average
at
best
o
id
buy
it
again
a
high
percentage
beer
with
extreme
fruit
flavor
perfect
for
all
those
gals
in
your
life
great
for
movie
and
a
beer
night
overall
while
the
hops
are
not
the
star
of
this
show
they
do
make
longer
and
more
pronounced
appearances
than
they
do
in
other
belgianstyle
trippels
this
is
clearly
a
new
world
version
of
the
style
and
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
why
a
west
coast
interpretation
of
any
beer
is
worth
trying
have
this
one
on
the
patio
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
kind
of
unidimensional
tastes
good
and
is
highly
drinkable
just
not
very
interesting
or
complex
poured
into
a
large
brandy
snifter
pours
hazy
orange
gold
with
a
tall
white
head
that
dissipates
moderately
quickly
there
are
plentiful
tiny
bubbles
visible
in
the
beer
the
beer
smells
of
apples
pears
spices
and
malt
the
taste
is
that
of
a
classic
tripel
the
fruit
and
spice
notes
go
well
with
the
malt
backbone
the
hops
do
add
some
nice
balance
throughout
the
beer
the
malt
becomes
more
prominent
as
the
beer
continues
to
warm
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
in
the
flavor
but
i
do
taste
some
alcohol
as
the
beer
warms
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
this
is
very
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
do
this
tripel
is
loaded
with
obvious
belgian
qualities
apparently
trying
to
offer
a
literal
lesson
in
abbeystyle
ale
nuanced
it
is
not
separating
it
from
the
best
of
its
style
such
beers
can
be
simultaneously
delicate
and
spirituous
yet
stand
up
to
the
most
savory
of
foods
this
beer
does
stand
up
but
so
rigidly
as
to
be
awkward
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruits
yeast
and
spices
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
as
far
as
american
triples
go
green
flash
trippel
is
good
and
drinkable
however
there
are
other
american
tripels
i
would
reach
for
first
nice
carbonation
with
plenty
of
alcohol
a
decent
offering
but
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
i
poured
this
a
bit
cold
all
of
the
above
were
accentuated
upon
warming
of
the
glass
overall
its
not
bad
at
all
but
wont
change
you
from
a
hop
head
to
a
tripel
lover
anytime
soon
pretty
good
tripel
definitely
better
examples
out
there
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
overall
i
want
to
finish
this
whole
growler
by
myself
but
that
would
be
stupid
im
glad
my
roommate
is
here
to
help
with
it
originally
reviewed
06212011
owell
i
definitely
wouldnt
be
classifying
this
as
a
tripel
its
not
that
great
at
all
actually
as
any
style
tastes
like
an
amateur
aged
ipa
o
not
my
favorite
offering
from
green
flash
nor
the
best
tripel
ive
had
but
still
quite
satisfying
its
pretty
bold
like
many
of
their
other
beers
which
i
have
to
respect
fruity
aroma
has
a
strong
yeasty
slightly
rubbery
overtone
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
and
rather
persistent
ivory
head
flavor
has
mainly
fruity
and
yeasty
notes
and
whoa
a
fairly
strong
alcohol
nip
finish
has
a
hint
of
resin
to
it
texture
has
ok
body
and
a
fair
amount
of
fizz
and
life
tasty
and
satisfying
keep
an
eye
peeled
for
it
overall
really
like
this
one
nice
take
on
the
style
and
a
great
orangetangerine
juice
taste
and
appeal
for
a
tripel
really
like
it
o
such
a
well
balanced
and
excellent
beer
high
abv
is
well
hidden
which
is
impressive
for
a
9
7
abv
brew
well
done
will
be
buying
this
one
again
despite
a
few
gripes
listed
above
i
quite
like
this
beer
its
not
super
crisp
and
complex
like
a
true
belgian
tripel
would
be
its
something
different
be
prepared
for
that
and
you
should
enjoy
this
one
this
is
exactly
what
a
west
coast
interpretation
of
a
tripel
would
taste
like
in
my
mind
the
hops
really
add
some
complexity
without
taking
too
much
away
from
the
belgian
yeast
and
malt
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
chalice
at
cool
temp
liquor
is
medium
amber
hazy
although
not
a
bottleconditioned
beer
effervescent
perhaps
a
tad
darker
than
one
might
see
in
a
typical
trippel
pours
a
large
loose
white
head
that
remains
a
foamy
presence
leaving
light
lacing
on
the
nose
is
dried
apricot
mango
banana
and
clove
lots
of
fruit
in
the
flavor
with
apricot
notes
being
dominant
up
front
and
banana
toward
the
end
some
spiciness
and
a
fairly
sweet
finish
the
substantial
alcohol
is
displayed
as
an
underlying
counterpoint
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
sweet
for
the
style
and
the
haziness
is
a
bit
puzzling
doa
overallthis
beer
just
seems
unfinished
to
me
on
the
bright
side
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
very
pleasant
creaminess
however
there
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
good
balance
of
flavors
the
punch
of
tartness
and
astringent
alcohol
overpower
everything
else
in
the
taste
also
the
lack
of
pungent
yeastiness
is
a
big
disappointment
as
thats
something
i
really
look
for
in
a
good
tripel
though
theres
worse
to
be
had
i
cant
say
id
recommend
this
smooth
body
nearly
syrupy
with
a
slight
astringency
boozy
fruit
and
earthy
prickly
notes
in
the
aftertaste
slippery
feel
some
fruity
brandy
and
apricot
notes
overall
a
slow
sipper
best
shared
a
very
rich
and
coating
mouthfeel
this
is
called
a
trippel
but
it
had
a
lot
in
common
with
a
dipa
there
was
the
lush
tropical
fruits
and
the
dryhopping
added
a
nice
bitter
touch
well
integrated
and
very
good
makes
me
think
this
is
a
new
offering
as
the
prior
reviews
werent
all
that
great
overall
i
got
this
beer
because
i
love
tripels
and
the
quality
of
their
ipas
is
very
good
so
i
took
a
bit
of
a
chance
as
some
of
the
other
reviews
stated
we
have
a
great
value
here
for
the
money
but
if
its
in
the
budget
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
trippel
one
of
my
favorite
styles
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
here
as
well
o
not
necessarily
the
best
americanmade
beer
ive
tried
but
its
fairly
well
made
and
easy
to
drink
o
you
might
find
better
examples
of
the
style
but
you
will
also
pay
a
lot
more
this
is
a
great
value
and
a
good
way
to
experience
a
well
made
domestic
tripel
without
shelling
out
big
bucks
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
hue
which
leaves
a
creamy
dense
two
finger
head
and
clingy
lacing
here
and
therethe
smell
is
barley
sugarcorrianderfennel
and
spicy
hopsthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
touch
creamy
with
tastes
of
sweet
pastryspicy
hopsjarrah
honeydillbiscuty
malts
and
finished
with
a
spicy
herbalness
and
overall
its
an
easy
enough
trippel
to
sink
but
i
dont
think
id
run
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again

definitely
some
better

out

but
this
is
worth
a
try
i
thought
this
beer
okay
i
think
there
is
too
much
alcohol
in
the
taste
and
i
thought
it
lacks
depth
in
flavor
poured
from

this

o
now
this
is
a
very
old

so
dont
take
this
review
compared
to
a
new
fresh
bottle
i
think
this
beer
actually
ages
okay
but
i
still
prefer
this
fresh
o
good
solid
trippel
now
that
green
flash
is
available
in
mo
i
will
probably
have
this
more
often
especially
since
my
gf
loves
belgians
it
isnt
the
best
out
there
or
the
best
available
in
my
area
but
its
very
approachable
and
delicious
very
good
job
3
5
a
good
inexpensive
tasty
tripel
from
just
down
the
road
i
will
most
definitely
be
having
this
again
o
this
is
a
superb
trippel
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
had
the
smell
is
a
bit
pinesol
like
with
a
bit
of
a
sharp
ping
in
the
nose
floral
herbal
and
pine
notes
makes
the
beer
inviting
the
flavor
matches
with
tame
flavor
on
the
front
end
the
bouquets
the
a
tropical
and
floral
flavor
hints
of
the
mildest
tangerine
rose
and
an
accent
of
alcohol
make
this
beer
fairly
light
drinking
a
light
beer
with
a
heavy
abv
watch
out
because
though
its
welcoming
its
still
a
green
flash
o
considering
the
strength
of
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
remarkably
well
hidden
from
the
taste
this
and
a
lack
of
cloying
sweetness
makes
this
rather
easy
to
drink
compared
to
other
tripels
do
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
balanced
flavor
that
fits
well
with
the
style
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
not
terrible
some
enjoyable
characteristics
about
it
but
i
was
expecting
more
slightly
above
average
tripel
but
with
so
many
options
out
there
i
wont
be
making
an
effort
to
grab
more
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
amber
color
with
very
little
head
carbonation
is
clearly
even
through
the
cloudiness
the
head
was
minimal
but
i
could
have
been
a
little
more
aggressive
on
the
pour
fantastic
color
though
nose
is
of
floral
hops
and
with
notes
of
honey
and
bee
pollen
with
just
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
smells
wonderful
in
the
taste
i
pick
up
some
caramel
and
honey
sweetness
along
with
a
little
bitterness
and
some
sour
lemon
zest
for
a
little
balance
finish
has
some
belgium
spice
to
it
great
mouth
feel
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
and
clean
carbonation
is
a
little
above
medium
but
adds
to
the
drinkability
overall
i
dig
this
beer
a
lot
its
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
it
alcohol
is
surprisingly
toned
down
considering
is
damn
near
10abv
this
is
my
3rd
green
flash
beer
and
they
have
not
let
me
down
yet
green
flash
trippel
is
a
little
bit
better
than
the
typical
american
brewed
tripel
but
not
quite
at
the
level
of
a
typical
belgian
one
if
compared
to
beer
in
general
this
is
a
solid
drink
that
will
loosen
the
tension
in
your
body
with
its
relatively
sneaky
9

abv
mo
this
is
my
first
green
flash
beer
and
trippel
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
style
but
i
doubt
very
much
i
will
be
returning
here
too
much
booziness
and
not
enough
deep
flavor
o
overall
a
good
tripel
not
the
best
but
far
from
the
worst
maybe
with
some
time
the
alcohol
burn
would
fade
a
bit
which
would
make
the
beer
better
all
in
all
a
decent
tripel
not
the
best
american
version
and
not
as
good
as
the
belgians
but
i
like
it
and
would
have
another
o
try
it
if
you
like
tripels
i
have
bought
before
and
would
buy
again
alright
but
not
incredible
green
flashs
trippel
smells
great
but
the
flavor
is
not
nearly
as
complex
as
the
aroma
d
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
9

you
cannot
taste
it
at
all
great
stuff
d
the
brew
was
drinking
damn
good
and
was
a
solid
tripel
i
was
very
surprised
with
the
green
flash
take
on
a
belgian
tripel
serving
type
bottle
drink
wasnt
too
bad
pretty
tasty
for
the
price
point
i
have
seen
in
stores
was
a
welcome
gift
cheers
a
very
enjoyable
tripel
d
this
is
a
well
made
and
enjoyable
beer
its
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
with
its
good
taste
but
i
could
sip
on
this
for
sometime
worth
getting
your
hands
on
sometime
to
try
a
good
american
trippel
but
the
alcohol
presense
hurt
the
overall
balance
in
this
brew
imo
it
could
use
more
carbonation
and
perhaps
some
aging
would
help
d
one
bottle
was
enough
bitterness
got
to
me
after
a
while
d
therefore
the
drinkability
isnt
very
high
either
this
beer
nails
the
smell
and
abv
of
the
belgians
but
doesnt
have
the
complexity
balance
or
mouthfeel
of
some
real
good
ones
a
bit
of
a
let
down
decent
beer
belgian
triple
not
quite
but
good
d
seems
like
it
would
compliment
some
light
food
like
a
quiche
this
is
an
obviously
wellmade
beer
but
not
very
distinctive
pours
a
burnished
golden
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
big
white
billowy
meringuelike
head
pretty
spicy
on
the
nose
with
belgian
yeast
citrus
and
freshly
mown
grass
spicy
and
hoppy
on
the
palate
very
nicely
balanced
with
a
prickly
carbonation
and
a
lingering
sweetness
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
eventually
it
is
felt
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
better
then
the
taste
lightly
bubbly
with
a
touch
of
spicy
bitterness
and
a
residual
dry
malt
sweetness
to
make
up
this
medium
body
beer
but
the
taste
never
really
gets
better
even
with
the
high
abv
all
in
all
a
disappointment
and
a
pass
in
my
book
the
beer
is
a
amber
in
color
almost
like
bottle
apple
juice
and
my
pour
left
very
little
head
there
was
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
from
my
glass
but
it
did
not
stick
around
the
aroma
was
mostly
missing
some
yeast
esters
and
a
little
alcohol
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
spicy
a
little
alcoholic
and
as
it
warms
up
the
orchard
fruit
flavors
start
to
manifest
the
beer
is
a
bit
undercarbonated
for
the
style
which
definitely
impairs
the
experience
d
not
the
best
but
tasty
nontheless
very
drinkable
would
never
guess
it
was
over
9
abv
enjoy
d
awesome
easily
one
of
the
best
american
trippels
ive
ever
had
body
is
thick
and
sweet
with
not
quite
enough
carbonation
to
back
up
the
alcohol
and
sugar
d
its
not
my
new
favorite
beer
but
i
like
it
and
i
would
drink
another
its
a
good
solid

a

there
is
also

heavy
side
of
medium
with
a

of
carbonation
and
more

than
i
was
hoping
for
this
seems
to
be
just
another
in
the
long
line
of
subpar
american
brewed
tripels
jd
drinkability
this
beer
lacks
what
im
normally
seeking
in
a
tripel
its
not
bad
really
but
it
falls
short
of
the
experience
i
want
i
dont
see
myself
purchasing
this
one
again
very
good
and
refreshing
theres
something
a
but
different
in
there
from
other
trippels
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
an
excellent
attempt
at
the
belgian

worthy
of
trying
for
anyone

its
in

probably
wont

again
d
i
was
very
excited
by
the

of
the
beer
but
the
strong
alcohol
diminish
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
d
pretty
nice

a

better

overall
a
good
trippel
and
a
good
value

for
the

i
could
see
coming
back
to
this
beer
when
the
weather
gets
warmer
it
might
be
an
interesting
comparison
to
do
sidebyside
with
other
u
s
trippels
im
sure
green
flash
would
hold
its
own
notes
a
fine
tripel
but
really
there
are
better
options
out
there
tripel
karmeleit
and
allagash
curieux
come
to
mind
verdict
green
flash
have
crafted
a
serviceable
american
trippel
here
its
nothing
earthshaking
but
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
drinkability
a
pretty
solid
domestic
tripel
which
i
think
people
dont
realize
at
least
by
my
standards
is
hard
to
come
by
these
days
would
you
expect
something
from
green
flash
even
a
trippel
that
wasnt
slightly
at
least
heavily
hopped
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangegold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
candy
sugar
apples
belgian
yeast
bready
malt
and
some
bananas
and
tropical
fruit
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
some
alcohol
noticable
in
the
taste
not
too
much
that
its
overpowering
but
i
can
tell
its
there
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
little
bit
creamy
and
coating
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
think
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
but
its
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
with
that
being
said
i
think
its
worth
a
try
the
body
is
moderate
and
a
bit
too
sweet
for
style
carbonation
is
a
little
light
as
well
overall
there
really
arent
very
many
flaws
to
the
beer
but
i
would
like
more
of
a
belgian
feeltaste
d
very
drinkable
for
an
american
trippel
its
pretty
good
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
some
belgian
yeast
you
also
get
a
little
floral
component
the
flavor
is
fruit
yeast
and
alcohol
you
get
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
flavor
and
the
floral
component
is
also
there
the
alcohol
is
warming
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
an
interesting
take
on
a
tripel
that
i
think
works
nicely
taste
is
still
pretty
good
can
tell
this
one
should
not
be
cellared
very
long
but
maintained
its
freshness
well
the
hops
are
plenty
noticeable
and
help
to
balance
out
the
very
sweet
malts
honey
flavors
are
almost
dominant
alcohol
my
bottle
says
8
5
rather
than
the
aforementioned
9
7
is
readily
apparent
and
contributes
a
warming
effect
right
away
even
after
some
age
on
it
it
has
not
smoothed
out
like
i
thought
it
would
still
rough
around
the
edges
and
does
not
do
a
good
job
of
hiding
the
abv
it
is
a
decent
american
attempt
at
a
tripel
fun
to
give
it
a
go
every
now
and
again
a
beer
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
which
might
be
older
because
it
says
8
5
abv
left
a
nice
three
finger
head
with
little
lacing
after
the
head
subsided
appearance
is
a
nice
dark
golden
yellow
color
strong
yeasty
sugars
are
very
apparent
some
candied
fruits
also
in
the
smell
alcohol
is
still
pretty
strong
in
the
first
taste
then
giving
way
to
biscuit
and
dough
like
yeasts
clove
and
spices
maybe
a
small
amount
of
nutmeg
still
alot
of
heat
coming
from
the
alcohol
and
some
banana
like
flavor
mouthfeel
is
not
to
objectionable
but
all
and
all
the
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
lack
of
balance
d
a
decent
tripel
but
i
dont
think
well
return
to
this
one
drinkability
is
not
so
good
just
too
heavy
and
the
22oz
was
about
16
too
many
ok
i
had
it
again
finally
cracked
into
the
bottle
i
had
for
a
while
it
was
better
than
the
last
time
i
reviewed
it
though
i
dont
think
it
was
quite
as
good
as
it
has
been
in
the
past
still
quite
enjoyable
not
a
bad
interpretation
at
all
though
i
doubt
would
be
confused
with
a
belgian
classic
of
the
style
some
metallic
notes
through
it
off
as
well
overall
a
decent
tripel
but
i
am
by
no
means
a
connoisseur
of
this
style
i
enjoy
a
triple
once
in
a
while
and
at
5
99
for
the
22
oz
bottle
this
was
a
tasty
treat
opt
for
golden
monkey
if
you
can
medium
body
relatively
smooth
with
resinous
astringency
in
the
finish
cleaned
up
w
alcohol
and
phenols
again
crisp
moderate
carbonation
helps
smooth
things
out
in
the
middle
this
company
can
do
no
wrong
for
me
thus
far
this
triple
kicks
ass
it
leaves
a
3
finger
head
that
settles
down
with
some
great
lacings
it
has
a
sweet
belgian
smell
i
like
this
triple
because
although
it
has
the
trademark
belgian
caramel
sweetness
it
is
not
over
powered
by
it
and
is
very
drinkable
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
boozy
but
hey
its
a
triple
this
is
one
of
the
first
american
triples
that
i
think
can
hold
weight
against
its
belgian
counterparts
a
hoegaarden
snifter
hosts
this
fine
trippel
suitable
for
reading
or
a
nightcap
however
the
high
presence
of
alcohol
and
offstyle
flavors
hold
this
one
back
d
just
ok
wont
have
it
again
d
this
was
an
excellent
strong
and
complex
brew
a
good
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
tripel
while
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i
think
that
compared
to
the
classic
examples
of
the
style
some
of
the
flavors
seem
a
bit
unnaturally
forced
into
the
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
nightcap
beer
that
drinks
stronger
than
it
is
not
among
the
best
tripels
but
a
nice
enough
beer
overall
impression
not
bad
fairly
drinkable
considering
the
abv
enjoyable
beer
but
nothing
too
exciting
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
shared
with
psycohops
poured
into
twin
standard
tulip
glasses
the
ale
appears
a
clear
bright
apricot
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
lingering
creamy
off
white
foam
the
aromas
and
flavors
coming
from
the
beer
are
of
sweet
candi
sugars
fruits
such
as
tart
green
apples
pears
and
white
grapes
slightly
spicy
yeast
lots
of
alcohol
filling
the
nose
and
tingling
the
tongue
could
use
a
bit
more
body
though
but
its
still
worth
trying
clear
orange
body
under
two
finger
white
head
quick
dissipation
with
minimal
lacing
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
nose
but
more
watery
than
beerlike
decent
tripelish
taste
sweet
oranges
a
bit
of
coriander
and
a
slightly
bitter
alcohol
finish
pretty
weak
mouthfeel
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
alcohol
very
noticeable
so
1
bomber
is
more
than
enough
not
a
real
strong
example
of
belgianstyle
tripels
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
buy
one
again
poured
luminous
golden
color
in
my
chalice
with
white
head
nose
was
fairy
rich
with
boozy
sour
green
apples
on
the
palate
there
was
soft
malt
and
an
herbal
quality
that
mingled
with
the
sour
apple
fruityness
overall
very
boozy
and
fatiguing
to
drink
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
tripel
if
youre
going
to
compare
this
to
the
topshelf
belgian
tripels
youre
probably
not
going
to
be
overly
excited
but
if
you
approach
it
with
an
open
mind
and
take
it
for
what
it
is
its
a
darn
good
representation
d
with
that
sweetness
and
alcohol
flavor
its
not
a
beer
id
go
to
often
in
fact
given
the
immense
wealth
of
great
beers
the
triple
has
im
not
sure
ill
come
back
to
this
ever
again
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
but
a
slightly
interesting
take
on
a
tripel
definitely
a
good
sipper
and
a
wellrounded
beer
but
you
could
easily
mistake
it
for
something
else
fizzy
and
bubbly
like
water
on
a
hot
skillet
mellows
with
time
a
very
nice
not
too
harsh
tripel
sweet
fruits
and
a
spicy
belgian
balance
very
nice
all
around
but
a
little
off
on
the
taste
good
beer
pulled
this
bottle
from
my
very
modest
cellar
no
label
on
the
bottle
but
i
got
a
case
from
the
brewery
dated
august
2007
there
was
a
small
audible
pop
when
i
opened
it
small
foamy
head
when
poured
into
my
delirium
glass
which
quickly
dissipates
it
smells
like
yeast
and
spices
the
belgian
yeast
really
comes
through
in
the
taste
the
bananalike
flavor
i
remember
from
fresh
bottles
is
mostly
gone
now
very
drinkable
little
to
no
alcohol
burn
im
really
enjoying
this
it
seems
to
have
aged
really
well
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is

with
some
nice
yeast
notes
and
some
spices
the
taste
is
maltyyeasty
slight
bitterness
and
some
spice
medium
body
drinkable
this
tripel
is
not
as
spicy
as
others
which
to
me
i
like
this
is
a
nice
modest
offering
i
almost
always
prefer
a
dubbel
but
this
is
definitely
solid
dangerously
close
to
a
european
strong
pilsner
very
full
and
sticky
with
only
enough
carbonation
to
keep
the
head
up
green
flash
brews
some
great
beers
even
some
great
belgian
styles
but
this
one
is
just
about
middling
d

this
beer
for
a

a
hearty

sensation
to

bottle
was

it
looks

they
kicked
up

considering
the
style
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
very
drinkable
and
i
plan
to
have
this
again
sample
at
stone
this
brew
is
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
steadily
spotty
lacing
aroma
of
yeast
and
bananas
plus
a
bit
of
citrus
fullbodied
with
flavors
of
yeast
banana
and
spices
plus
some
yeast
and
hay
the
finish
is
spicy
with
citrus
and
spice
flavors
and
a
yeast
aftertaste
pretty
solid
all
around
regardless
the
trippel
has
a
czech
bite
of
maltiness
to
the
hops
and
roasted
barley
it
is
a
bit
less
sweet
than
the
barley
wine
that
is
brewed
by
green
flash
but
the
trippel
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
and
comforting
flavor
component
that
is
inherent
in
its
construct
overall
its
a
decent
tripel
its
worth
a
try
because
its
a
little
different
that
many
others
of
its
style
but
its
far
from
the
best
d
this
bottle
was
split
between
two
people
and
one
glass
with
a
meal
was
enough
this
beer
goes
well
with
light
spicy
food
but
in
my
opinion
does
not
stand
well
by
itself
d
overall
was
moderately
good
but
there
are
a
lot
better
examples
out
there
i
would
opt
for
before
spending
money
on
this
not
a
lot
of
complexity
and
a
tad
rough
at
times
flavorwise
bomber
pours
clear
orange
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
huge
white
head
aroma
is
full
of
the
bubblegum
and
sugar
you
would
expect
i
love
the
taste
light
full
of
bananas
and
spice
yeast
and
some
root
beer
a
very
nice
tripel
that
i
wish
would
find
a
way
into
green
flash
permament
rotation
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
along
with
a
spicey
yeast
aroma
its
warming
to
the
nose
and
full
of
esters
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
dry
earthy
taste
that
goes
down
slow
and
burns
a
bit
in
the
finish
there
is
nice
hop
character
to
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
prickly
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
although
there
are
plenty
better
available
d
enjoyable
i
like
it
but
will
probably
spend
my
money
on
other
trippels
d
a
nice
beer
this
isnt
a
bad
trippel
at
all
though
im
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
it
over
other
trippels
again
still
i
would
say
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
havent
had
it
glad
i
picked
it
up
i
just
bought
a
bottle
of
this
green
flash
trippel
today
poured
it
into
a
unibroue
tulip
glass
its
a
good
amber
color
id
say
i
liked
the
amount
of
foam
action
itd
smelled
good
and
it
tasted
good
too
its
very
light
with
a
good
aftertaste
i
drank
the
whole
thing
and
enjoyed
every
drop
of
it
id
drink
it
again
is
it
the
best
trippel
ive
ever
tasted
probably
not
but
its
pretty
good
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
in
the
least
definitely
worth
a
try
really
liked
this
tripel
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
it
is
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing

just
something
different
on
this
one
edit
i
just
read
mrhungrymonkeys
review
and
i
agree
that
it
needs
more
funk
good
point
this
is
certainly
a
tasty
brew
if
i
were
judging
it
as
a
tripel
id
say
it
didnt
have
the
rocktight
balance
of
a
paradigm
if
this
had
come
out
of
one
of
my
homebrew
bottles
i
would
brew
it
again
and
try
to
up
the
alcohol
to
dry
it
up
and
up
the
funk
towards
an
orvallike
medicine
cabinet
until
the
day
i
can
brew
tripels
this
good
though
i
would
gladly
lap
this
one
up
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
white
head
highly
carbonated
with
an
everlasting
ring
of
foam
and
no
lacing
smells
like
bananas
and
oranges
full
body
tasting
of
bananas
with
a
spicy
hint
reminds
me
of
a
tripel
karmeliet
but
cheaper
green
flash
has
been
good
to
me
so
far
poured
from
the
22oz
bottle
into
a
thin
tulip
pours
a
clearish
yellow
with
a
thin
but
active
white
head
smells
of
bananas
and
spices
mostly
pepper
taste
is
a
bit
bland
some
spice
kick
but
no
overwhelming
flavor
i
like
my
tripels
with
a
bit
more
oomph
i
guess
hides
the
alcohol
well
though
fairly
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
again
over
other
tripels

im

reaching
from

but
im
not
getting

hops
with
the
alcohol

this
triple
not
much
of
a
belgian
triple
heavily
distinctive
west
coast
flavors
though
pours
a
hazy
orange
into
a
goblet
with
a
1
finger
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
cap
and
clings
to
the
inside
of
the

all
through
the
drink
excellent

some
good
carbonation
action
as
well
aroma
is
of

is

and
a

with
lots
of
carbonation
taste
is
heavily
of
spice
clove
orange
malt
with
some
banana
caramel
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
overall
a
good
taste
lots
of
malt
comes
through
as
it
warms
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
i
may
try
this
again
sometime
and
will
have
to
get
a
firmer
grasp
on
the
style
this
beer
falls
short
it
lacks
the
true
belgian
character
the
yeast
seems
to
be
light
on
the
classic
aromas
and
flavors
the
alcohol
starts
to
hinder
its
drinkability
there
are
plenty
of
other
trippels
worth
drinking
above
this
one
d
not
bad
much
better
versions
of
this
style
i
felt
it
was
way
too
much
in
the
bananaclove
department
nothing
too
exceptional
here
but
not
bad
by
any
means
d
as
i
type
this
review
the
green
flash
tripel
gets
easier
and
easier
going
down
that
being
said
i
cant
really
say
that
the
drinkability
is
anything
above
average
especially
for
a
tripel
for
a
much
smoother
drinking
and
more
substantial
tripel
try
unibroues
la
fin
du
monde
this
beer
is
weird
because
if
you
blindfolded
me
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
was
a
tripel
i
guess
it
has
too
much
of
a
southern
cal
green
flash
twist
on
it
to
strictly
be
a
tripel
d
good
drinkability
a
nice
refreshing
beer
which
would
pair
well
with
food
not
badjust
not
to
my
liking
for
the
style
overall
a
decent
trippel
thats
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
your
beers
sweet
really
sweet
drinkability
overall
a
decent
made
american
tripel
definitely
drinkable
but
needs
a
bit
of
tweaking
to
become
a
better
beer
per
style
da
darker
triple
than
say
a
triple
karmelite
yet
still
a
good
quaf
as
this
style
is
still
not
the
most
common
for
american
brewers
i
give
them
credit
for
producing
one
of
the
more
difficult
bees
to
brew
to
drinkers
satisfaction
an
immature
creation
but
can
always
improve
next
year
d
good
but
others
are
better
some
of
the
bitterness
distracts
from
the
enjoyment
get
the
papers
get
the
papers
beers
ok
beers
ok
medium
thinbodied
and
mildly
juicy
the
beer
has
great
drinkability
and
is
very
refreshing
but
for
an
american
brewed
version
this
is
pretty
good
id
have
this
again
drinks
pretty
slow
a
lot
going
on
here
pretty
good
tripel
bottle
conditioning
so
maybe
buy
a
few
to
age
to
see
how
this
matures
i
bet
this
only
gets
better
with
a
few
years
on
it
d
not
really
my
favorite
nice
way
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
and
formed
a
small
snow
white
bubbly
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
banana
yeastbread
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
malt
pepper
bread
and
some
citrus
the
body
is
medium
and
just
slightly
creamy
and
the
finish
is
rather
peppery
a
good
beer
but
not
going
to
drive
anyone
away
from
their
favorite
tripels
d
another
kick
ass
beer
from
green
flash
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
tripel
a
great
american
version
of
the
style

goblets
cloudy

with

hints

and
cloves
some

well
taste
is
lemony
yeasty
and
spicy
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite

low
carbonation

is
appropriate
for
the
style

a

sipping
beer
pours
a
cloudy
bright
orangebrown
color
with
a
small
yet
dense
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
nice
cap
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
the
candi
sugare
has
a
nice
honey
floral
smell
some
banana
esters
as
well
the
taste
is
of
candi
sugar
and
belgian
yeast
which
gives
it
a
nice
banana
and
earthy
flavor
some
honey
and
a
nice
hop
spice
round
out
this
brew
the
feel
is
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
not
overcarbonated
like
some
belgian
styles
can
be
the
taste
is
sweet
in
the
typical
tripel
sort
of
way
though
it
is
not
very
sticky
or
slick
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
for
an
american
made
tripel
a
very
good
belgian
tripel
which
can
hang
with
its
belgain
counterparts
probably
one
of
the
better
if
not
best
american
tripels
that
i
have
had
d
very
drinkable
and
hides
the
8
5
well
d
quite
a
good
beer
i
still
believe
it
is
more
a
strong
biere
de
garde
then
a
triple
make
sure
you
are
not
drinking
the
bomber
alone
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
given
its
strength
yet
doesnt
offer
the
body
or
complexity
of
finer
tripels
body
is
a
touch
too
big
for
this
style
but
has
a
clean
smooth
mouthfeel
and
nice
drinkability
worth
seeking
out
as
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
styled
belgian
tripel
have
not
been
too
impressed
with
green
flash
brews
overall
and
this
also
fell
into
the
mediocre
category
not
a
big
fan
of
most
american
brewerys
attempts
at
a
tripel
in
fact
one
of
the
drier
tripels
i
have
tasted
which
was
not
a
bad
thing
in
my
eyes
not
too
bad
for
the
price
might
drink
again
worth
trying
once
an
earthen
tripel
which
doesnt
seem
to
translate
all
that
well
an
average
tasting
version
of
the
style
at
best
not
worth
a
try
for
an
american
brewed
belgian
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
not
going
to
cut
into
the
belgian
export
market
but
it
is
a
pleasant
addition
to
the
us
supply
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
really
as
digestible
as
a
true
belgian
but
a
closer
stab
at
the
style
then
most
of
green
flashs
american
contemporaries
the
booze
and
thickness
are
the
biggest
weakness
and
i
reckon
the
time
in
the
cellar
helped
temper
that
some
so
im
glad
i
procrastinated
overall
this
is
ok
but
not
great
not
as
complex
or
unified
in
flavor
as
i
would
expect
from
a
tripel
the
alcohol
is
harsh
and
could
stand
some
cellaring
still
quite
fruity
and
sweet
worth
a
try
pours
a
rich
golden
to
amber
color
with
a
light
white
head
smell
is
rich
bold
and
malty
with
a
strong
sweetness
and
lemony
characteristic
taste
is
well
hopped
to
balance
the
maltiness
somewhat
dry
at
the
same
time
however
interesting
spiced
character
too
not
bad
at
all
and
i
can
feel
the
style
growing
on
me
d
i
think
a
good
american
take
on
the
style
but
perhaps
a
little
on
the
subtle
side
for
my
taste
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
thought
this
was
excellently
done
and
really
quite
nice
overall
i
would
love
to
get
it
again
and
maybe
try
aging
it
a
bit
to
see
if
some
of
the
fruit
and
hop
flavors
die
back
a
bit
and
bring
some
of
whats
underneath
up
to
the
front
still
this
was
excellent
and
i
would
have
to
recommend
it
to
those
who
are
a
fan
of
the
style
extra
note
yeast
as
a
chaser
strong
dried
hop
lime
grapefruit
wheat
grass
and
sea
salt
character
on
the
nose
with
a
yeasty
chalky
vitamin
c
and
soggy
bread
crust
taste
a
bold
tripel
one
that
embraces
both
belgian
tradition
and
the
pioneering
spirit
of
21st
century
u
s
micros
would
buy
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
d
not
bad
but
i
expected
more
from
green
flash
not
this
brewerys
best
brew
nor
the
best
tripel
but
still
not
a
horrible
sample
worth
a
try
notes
not
bad
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
green
flash
products
that
just
arrived
here
in
fresno
cheers
beertracker
tripple
is
not
an
easy
style
to
do
well
but
i
think
gf
has
done
a
good
job
been
very
impressed
to
this
point
to
the
brewery
as
i
was
able
to
have
some
samples
of
the
others
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sugary
yeasty
and
mostly
clean
with
notes
of

yeast
and

and
something
i
wouldnt

trying
again
d
probably
a

over

and
i
think
it
did
it
good
ill
go
on

record
to

im
a
fan
of

tripels
the
beer
emerges
from
the
22
ounce
bottle
a
hazy
orange
or
a
reddish
yellow
the
head
piles
high
on
the
body
creamy
an
off
white
color
as
it
diminishes
to
nothingness
the
lacing
provides
a
bit
of
privacy
as
it
obscures
the
glass
nose
has
a
big
fruit
like

bananas
over

comment
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
the
triple
represents
a
noble
effort
and
a
very
acceptable
product
i
would
happily
sample
it
again
all
around
an
average
beer
enjoyed
out
of
a
stemless
red
wineglass

as
a
stemless

a

tightly

and

halflife
of
the

little

on

of
a
typical
belgian
trippel
banana
clove
spice
lots
of

taste
is
a
little
dissapointing
simply
average
nothing
more
banana
and
clove
flavors
and
a
little
spice
alcohol
flavors
are
disrupting
my
palate
the
ethanol
really
is
noticable
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
also
a
letdown
oily
and
slick
not
light
and
tingly
like
a
typical
belgian
trippel
overall
an
average
belgian
style
trippel
although
a
good
attempt
from
a
decent
american
microbrewery
in
my
opinion
worth
a
try
but
if
youre
looking
for
that
authentic
belgian
trippel
stick
to
the
trapist
breweries
flavors
are
certainly
in
line
with
the
belgian
style
tripel
but
seem
a
tad
rough
around
the
edges
flavors
of
banana
clove
spice
vanilla
wheat
orange
and
yeast
are
apparent
but
are
dont
seem
to
be
supported
by
the
typical
subtle
maltyhoney
sweetness
of
a
true
belgian
tripel
well
worth
a
try
but
the
authentic
belgians
are
heads
above
this
was
a
fairly
decent
tripel
from
one
of
the
great
american
micros
poured
golden
with
a
larger
than
expected
head
nice
aromas
spiced
green
apples
candy
malts
some
alcohol
tase
was
more
on
the
side
of
flavor
overload
not
very
subtle
exactly
like
most
american
tripels
are
to
the
palate
somewhat
harsh
banana
flavored
syrupy
alcohol
but
not
too
bad
the
mouthfeel
bothered
me
it
was
not
very
light
at
all
and
the
body
was
heavier
than
i
like
in
a
tripel
thankfully
the
full
flavors
did
hide
some
of
the
less
refined
alcohols
give
it
a
try
if
you
want
to
try
to
believe
there
is
some
hope
for
an
americanized
tripel
trippel
is
far
from
horrible
but
its
nowhere
near
a
good
version
of
my
favorite
belgian
style
my
recommendation
is
to
spend
your
hardearned
money
on
green
flash
ipa
instead
now
theres
a
quality
beer
the
results
were
mixed
it
was
definitely
drinkable
though
the
alcohol
content
was
very
noticeable
and
distracting
the
taste
was
simple
with
little
of
the
complexity
that
make
tripels
and
quadrupels
so
appealing
each
sip
was
very
much
like
the
prior
a
sweet
good
tasting
beer
with
little
depth
to
it
better
than
average
but
not
great
the
price
cant
be
beat
though
at
least
here
in
irvine
for
a
decent
brew
of
this
type
drinkability
a
nice
stab
at
the
style
but
a
few
too
many
flaws
to
rank
higher
d
8
5
lets
you
think
you
can
rock
it
out
but
be
careful
it
bit
me
otherwise
the
mouthfeel
with
abv
lets
you
session
this
carefully
carefully
a
good
solid
form
of
the
style
drinkability
is
ok
i
cant
really
recommend
this
as
anything
except
a
very
nonoffensive
beer
this
could
be
more
complex
in
flavor
but
it
is
absolutely
free
of
any
faults
or
rough
edges

i
still
never
met
a
trippel
i
did
not
like


this
wasnt
necessarily
a
bad
ale
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
parade
it
around

at

i
am
not
sure
how
many
of
these
you
could
have

only
mediocre
not
bad
by
any
means
just
stock
the
usual
suspects
are
present
coriander
wheat
apples
but
nothing
to
set
it
apart
taste
is
damn
good
and
bolder
than
i
expected
sweet
malt
with
a
lemony
tartness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
as
it
should
be
crisp
yet
robust
im
enjoying
this
very
much
there
is
not
a
beer
style
more
oftmassacred
by
micro
brewers
than
the
tripel
this
is
a
notable
exception
could
have
been
a
lot
more
daring
but
well
executed
d
there
are
so
many
examples
of
this
style
that
are
so
much
better
i
am
not
going
to
drink
many
of
these
a
decernt
beer
overall
but
not
the
best
american
rendition
of
a
trippel
that
ive
had
almost
tastes
like
it
was
simply
fermented
too
warm
great
mouthfeel
though
i
think
this
would
have
benefited
from
some
more
candi
sugar
to
thin
it
out
a
bit
but
with
the
combination
of
hops
and
spicy
yeast
if
i
were
tasting
this
blind
i
would
have
guessed
it
is
a
saison
but
for
only
4
99
out
here
on
the
east
coast
its
worth
picking
up
and
trying
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
you
wont
really
be
disappointed
either
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
even
the
3rd
anniversary
bottle
when
it
was
8
5
but
now
the
new
label
says
9
7
so
either
they
got
it
wrong
the
first
time
or
something
changed
either
way
this
is
awesome
way
too
easy
to
drink
given
the
strength
the
flash
trippel
poured
out
very
nicely
a
magnificent
radiant
amber
with
good
cabonation
and
a
nice
modest
rich
foamy
head
smell
was
pretty
good
but
a
bit
underwhelming
for
the
style
taste
was
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
trippel
it
was
good
but
the
peppery
notes
domminated
and
there
was
actually
very
little
malt
sweetness
to
it
very
dry
for
a
trippel
easy
to
drink
and
it
was
not
offensive
to
the
pallet
in
any
way
worth
a
try
seems
a
bit
thin
but
for
what
it
offers
and
the
prices
ive
read
its
a
bargain
in
this
category
cheers
rather
thin
mouthfeel
kicks
off
this
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
beer
vibrant
ripe
tropical
fruit
flavors
lead
the
way
with
a
mild
sweetness
that
sustains
this
beer
notes
of
pepper
creep
in
towards
midsip
alongside
some
drying
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
allowing
the
sweetness
and
spicyness
to
vie
for
front
stage
its
pretty
much
a
tie
illustrating
the
excellent
balance
of
this
beer
nice
though
i
like
it
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
a
nice
example
of
an
american
trippel
not
exactly
like
a
belgian
would
produce
which
is
what
we
are
all
about
making
our
own
versions
of
long
standards
drinkability
decent
but
not
overwhelming
by
any
means
i
found
this
to
be
a
touch
too
sweet
which
wore
me
down
a
bit
by
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
beer
is
good
happy
international
style
beering
d
good
an
entire
bomber
is
more
than
enough
of
this
delightful
brew
worth
trying
i
am
really
surprised
this
is
rated
so
poorly
i
dont
think
i
will
have
it
again
though
green
flash
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
it
starts
very
typical
and
average
of
the
style
and
never
does
much
to
improve
the
abv
is
sizable
but
actually
well
presented
while
its
not
irretrievable
this
one
does
speak
to
sticking
to
what
you
do
best
especially
when
ones
best
is
as
good
as
theirs
i
got
this
one
on
cask
at
the
liars
club
this
was
their
only
cask
offering
so
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
try
it
arrived
in
a
chimay
chalice
a
cloudy
golden
colour
with
a
nice
head
that
was
retained
throughout
taste
wise
it
was
a
little
on
the
flat
side
for
a
tripel
i
was
left
wanting
more
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
but
on
cask
not
more
than
expected
if
you
see
this
on
cask
try
some
if
not
i
would
raher
have
a
lot
of
other
tripels
d
the
high
abv
and
thin
malts
dont
cut
it
for
me
they
focus
too
much
on
the
alcohol
flavors
i
find
that
green
flashs
hopbased
ales
pale
and
ipa
really
work
while
this
one
comes
up
short
notes
hmmmm
i
have
a
mixed
take
on
this
offering
on
one
side
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
american
attempts
at
a
tripel
however
it
still
falls
short
of
its
belgian
counterpart
this
is
getting
better
and
better
though
and
this
is
definitely
towards
the
top
as
far
as
a
yankee
offering
good
mouth
is
a
little
too
acidicastringent
but
generally
pleasant
a
good
tripel
definitely
a
good
value
you
can
get
better
but
you
will
pay
more
i
guess
this
beer
is
drinkable
for
a
tripel
but
green
flash
is
better
at
other
beer
styles
and
there
is
always
a
trappist
available
i
will
not
buy
this
one
again
strange
brew
with
some
good
components
interesting
enough
for
a
bottle
but
im
not
inclined
to
reach
for
another
decent
drinkability
although
a
rather
mediocre
beer
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
tripel
pass
this
one
by
like
fine
champagne
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
goldenbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuit
light
banana
peel
light
green
apple
skin
and
a
touch
of
spicy
yeast
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
biscuit
and
a
lessspicy
version
of
the
yeast
taking
full
control
every
now
and
again
some
chlorophyllladen
flowers
peek
their
heads
in
to
make
sure
things
are
going
okay
what
diligent
babysitters
he
says
sarcastically
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
not
all
that
reflective
of
a
tripel
nor
all
that
sparkling
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
i
just
dont
see
drinking
all
that
much
of
in
the
future
a
little
flat
in
flavor
but
good
esters
wish
they
surfaced
as
much
in
the
flavor
as
in
the
aroma
could
use
age
to
tame
the
alcohol
this
beer
needs
to
dry
up
and
get
a
serious
dose
of
carbonation
the
label
also
promises
northwest
hops
of
which
there
is
barely
a
trace
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
honey
fruit
and
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
honey
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
smells
slightly
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
overall
a
quality
tripel
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
prefer
dubbels
and
quads
to
tripels
but
bells
has
made
a
very
enjoyable
entry
here
overall
i
have
been
searching
for
this
beer
for
quite
some
time
and
was
expecting
a
lot
from
it
it
did
not
disappoint
i
am
glad
that
i
found
it
at
bells
very
good
in
every
aspect
and
pretty
close
to
a
perfect
american
tripel
this
pours
a
cloudy
golden
straw
color
with
a
tight
foam
cap
the
aroma
is
nicely
spiced
with
yeasty
esters
its
floral
with
honey
notes
along
with
some
orange
peel
and
coriander
the
flavor
has
a
light
yet
pleasing
bitterness
i
get
orange
peel
coriander
yeasty
esters
and
a
light
funk
which
i
imagine
might
emerge
as
it
develops
in
the
bottle
or
over
time
the
effervescence
keeps
the
flavors
lively
this
is
by
now
a
common
style
but
under
bells
craft
it
just
stands
shoulders
above
the
majority
good
stuff
another
tasty
beer
by
bells
proving
that
they
arent
afraid
of
the
belgian
yeast
culture
high
drinkability
for
a
relatively
high
abv
brew
be
careful
or
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
quickly
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
retention
is
thin
and
scattered
the
lacing
is
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
bready
sweet
and
has
a
subtle
spice
note
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
upfront
and
has
a
dry
fruity
spice
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
an
oily
feel
to
it
the
carbonation
was
pretty
high
but
should
be
for
the
style
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
was
glad
to
see
it
on
draft
in
my
area
bells
has
done
it
again
this
beer
accentuates
the
qualities
of
a
good
tripel
it
has
a
good
bright
mouthfeel
with
a
warm
finish
the
taste
is
imaginative
without
being
overbearing
the
notes
are
subtle
and
discreet
it
was
a
fine
beer
to
bring
in
2013
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
had
a
thin
skimming
of
white
foam
leaving
no
lacing
on
the
glass
completely
clear
and
golden
aromas
of
phenolic
clove
and
yeasty
banana
esters
not
unlike
a
hefe
some
spiciness
here
that
would
suggest
a
triple
tastes
like
it
smells
a
spicy
aftertaste
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
overall
a
solid
but
not
outstanding
brew
a
welcome
brew
from
bells
better
than
their
dubbel
slightly
hazed
pale
gold
with
a
frothy
head
of
clean
white
foam
smells
very
fruity
and
effervescent
with
some
belgian
type
yeast
the
taste
is
exceptionally
clean
and
fruity
with
just
a
light
belgian
character
to
it
some
floral
notes
as
well
so
clean
and
flavorful
with
about
a
medium
body
that
dries
the
palate
but
leaves
no
trace
of
residual
flavors
a
wonderful
take
on
a
tripel
i
wish
they
would
bottle
this
again
as
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
hand
it
was
alright
i
got
through
it
but
at
times
didnt
know
if
i
would
thanks
taturbo
for
thr
try
bottom
line
drink
em
if
you
have
em
this
beer
is
a
deep
hazy
orange
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
beer
is
undoubtedly
a
tripel
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
up
front
the
beer
sweeps
over
with
a
light
dark
fruit
flavor
with
figs
and
raisins
there
is
some
flowery
notes
a
bit
of
wheat
a
slight
lemon
grass
a
little
onion
perhaps
this
beer
is
spicy
the
belgium
yest
is
obvious
there
is
a
crispy
spiciness
an
earthy
spiciness
plenty
drinkable
for
9
i
do
prefer
bottle
conditioning
in
my
belgian
beers
but
tap
is
fine
a
solid
american
take
on
a
belgian
beer
a
spicy
and
hoppier
version
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
have
not
had
many
tripels
before
so
i
dont
have
much
to
judge
this
beer
off
of
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
o
light
and
sweet
floral
and
citrus
refreshing
overall
i
was
reluctant
to
try
this
beer
because
usually
belgian
styles
are
not
my
favorite
this
beer
really
didnt
bring
the
traditional
flavors
i
had
come
to
expect
and
it
really
came
through
like
a
nice
sparkling
wine
overall
i
would
like
to
try
it
in
a
bottle
again
but
sadly
cant
find
any
around
my
state
its
as
good
as
many
others
i
have
tried
and
worth
a
second
visit
o
this
was
very
drinkable
especially
at
being
9
but
the
flavor
and
aroma
seemed
a
little
restrained
for
being
a
triple
quite
refreshing
though
pours
a
clear
gold
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
a
hint
of
cinnamon
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
hint
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
tripel
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
a
hint
of
spice
hint
of
hop
sweet
malt
and
slight
pale
malt
overall
lacking
in
appearance
and
body
good
aroma
and
blend
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
a
little
yeasty
grainy
im
shocked
that
this
beer
is
9
amazing
hides
it
well
good
finish
not
too
dry
id
have
this
again
overall
for
a
tripel
this
is
not
what
i
look
for
its
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
probably
wont
be
wanting
to
try
this
again
anytime
soon
i
prefer
some
creamyness
o
overall
seems
like
another
american
take
on
a
belgian
classic
definitely
not
classic
to
style
but
not
bad
by
any
means
seems
like
a
tripel
in
the
way
that
kerbos
from
flyingdog
is
a
tripel
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
special
occasions
fuller
medium
body
ridiculously
high
carbonation
very
bubbly
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
this
is
somewhat
like
a
cross
between
champagne
and
a
trpel
which
has
a
pretty
interesting
result
good
but
not
great
taste
is
good
but
not
anything
that
really
stands
out
ill
leave
it
to
others
to
suss
out
the
nuances
but
this
is
more
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
a
tripel
alcohol
is
nowhere
at
least
after
a
20oz
alpha
king
im
at
macnivens
on
massachusetts
avenue
in
indianapolis
for
the
record
i
like
this
place
and
they
have
wireless
its
a
bit
bourgeois
for
my
taste
but
not
horrible
they
play
music
its
busy
the
beer
isnt
that
costly
and
they
have
good
stuff
on
tap
bombers
are
prohibitively
expensive
though
oh
well
i
drink
bombers
at
home
i
come
here
for
stuff
on
tap
but
i
digress
pretty
onedimensional
ale
not
much
of
a
yeast
presence
but
its
there
sort
of
a
soursweet
thing
going
with
it
not
a
heavily
spiced
or
really
heavily
flavored
ale
to
speak
of
i
can
appreciate
its
simplicity
but
its
hardly
worth
having
as
a
special
glad
i
got
to
try
it
as
i
probably
never
would
have
bought
a
six
pack
of
it
malty
some
hops
you
get
it
the
beer
is
mostly
transparent
just
slightly
hazy
orange
hued
with
nearly
an
inch
of
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
layer
after
a
few
moments
leaving
some
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
malt
yeast
spice
ripe
oranges
hops
the
flavor
is
not
up
to
par
with
the
authentic
belgian
tripels
i
appreciate
that
it
has
a
different
hop
character
and
is
not
necessarily
trying
to
replicate
something
belgian
however
bells
sparkling
ale
lacks
the
delectable
quality
found
in
the
upper
tier
examples
of
the
style
yeast
character
is
lacking
malt
presence
is
there
but
could
certainly
be
more
robust
and
present
middle
class
in
the
style
yet
solid
and
worth
a
try
pours
a
medium
gold
color
w
a
thin
offwhite
head
very
clean
and
clear
looking
for
the
tripels
im
used
to
seeing
average
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
snifter
glass
the
nose
is
apple
pear
anise
pepper
and
some
spices
id
really
like
to
smell
more
yeast
and
malt
in
this
brew
and
its
a
little
on
the
weak
side
for
me
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
fruit
spices
and
pepper
coming
forward
in
the
flavor
i
dont
get
any
of
the
9
alcohol
at
all
feel
is
fairly
light
and
dry
w
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
burn
on
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
from
an
excellent
brewery
i
would
get
this
again
cheers
85
overall
the
beer
is
good
though
i
get
tired
of
it
after
a
awhile
nice
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
ones
within
the
style
d
drinkbility
was
good
i
enjoyed
this
yeasty
flavor
can
be
a
little
overwhelming
at
times
though
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
lovely
creamy
fluffy
white
head
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
bready
malt
bananas
cloves
with
a
nice
peppery
belgian
yeast
banana
really
dominates
the
flavor
which
is
ok
in
my
book
slightly
peppery
and
spicy
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
nicely
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
bought
bottles
of
this
when
i
had
the
chance
drinkabiility
3
i
dont
think
this
is
a
tripel
ill
come
back
to
even
with
the
benefit
of
some
age
to
not
down
the
alcoholic
heat
the
flavors
werent
that
impressive
although
they
went
together
well
maybe
that
was
a
product
of
the
age
as
well
though
still
this
is
a
below
average
tripel
in
my
book
had
while
at
brewvival
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
brewvival
imperial
pint
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
subtle
banana
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
banana
and
grain
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
but
not
very
memorable
i
had
forgotten
that
i
had
tried
this
one
until
i
found
it
in
my
notes
after
all
of
the
other
great
brews
i
tried
this
one
just
wasnt
very
memorable
still
had
a
nicely
balanced
flavor
just
not
very
robust
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
thats
about
it
overall
for
a
triple
this
was
fantastically
drinkable
no
hints
of
alcohol
at
all
and
really
just
amazingly
complex
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
as
i
heard
it
is
mind
blowing
this
is
one
that
needs
to
be
sought
out
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
know
this
gets
mixed
review
on
this
site
though
in
terms
of
american
tripels
this
is
pretty
high
on
my
list
my
guess
is
that
it
gets
dogged
a
bit
because
its
not
exactly
true
to
style
when
compared
to
belgian
tripels
though
i
really
think
this
is
a
prime
example
of
an
american
take
on
this
style
kind
of
like
ipas
youve
got
your
hoppy
american
styles
and
your
more
subtle
british
varieties
my
review
reflects
my
opinion
of
this
being
sort
of
a
subgenre
of
tripel
thus
i
scored
it
pretty
well
against
other
belgian
tripels
i
could
see
how
this
wouldnt
do
as
well
if
someone
was
expecting
a
similar
flavor
profile
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
it
this
beer
is
well
worth
trying
and
truly
underrated
approach
it
purely
on
its
own
merits
and
i
think
youll
like
it
pours
a
fairly
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
fairly
large
off
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
nose
brings
a
fair
amount
of
belgian
spice
and
hints
of
fruit
as
well
as
a
bit
of
sweet
bread
taste
adds
in
a
bit
of
sugar
although
it
is
mostly
dry
the
earthy
spice
and
fruit
flavors
are
present
but
faint
feel
is
light
and
airy
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
but
isnt
much
compared
to
many
of
the
belgian
versions
of
the
style
d
very
drinkable
the
9
abv
barely
shows
itself
except
for
in
the
flavor
just
a
bit
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
thes
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
very
drinkable
despite
the
abv
and
very
tasty
d
overall
a
bit
of
a
misstep
from
a
world
class
brewery
fuck
it
they
cant
all
be
black
note
drinkability
high

a
light

some

but
nothing
producing
a

or
a
cap
not
all
that
sparkling
smell
is
pretty
weak
all
things
considered
getting
some
faint
fruits
apples
pears
and
plum
but
they
are
very
light
a
sweet
malt
hit
and
just
a
bit
of
sugars
corn
taste
is
a
step
up
with
the
fruits
souped
up
with
pears
coming
out
on
top
with
apple
and
plum
after
i
do
get
some
corn
adjunct
flavor
light
but
noticable
some
yeasty
bread
in
the
back
not
memorable
this
was
good
but
does
not
hack
it
style
wise
im
a
de
dolle
guy
myself
but
ive
had
better
american
triples
pours
a
nice
bright
gold

low
yet
spritzy
carbonation
minimal

scent
is
very
floral
rose
water
pear

is
unique
for
a

slight
candied
sugar
taste
accompanies
the
rose
water
hibiscus
vanilla
pear
apple
and
grape
flavors
somewhat
creamy
body
dry
finnish
and
moderate
carbonation
a
unique
beer
for
the
style
with
a
lt
of
nice
floral
and
fruit
notes
d
more
like
champagne
than
i
expected
higher
alcohol
in
the
mouth
than
on
the
nose
light
and
fruity
on
the
nose
but
a
little
lackluster
on
the
carbonation
not
a
great
representation
of
the
style
but
a
surprisingly
champagnelike
beer
they
hit
the
bottles
stated
target
on
the
mark
but
im
still
disappointed
that
all
of
the
wonderful
scents
didnt
fully
transition
into
the
taste
drinkability
maybe
a
little
too
grainy
now
that
im
deeper
into
the
session
ill
call
it
more
earthy
than
grainy
to
give
it
great
drinkability
for
me
i
dont
know
the
flavours
come
across
as
a
little
harsh
so
ill
say
it
isnt
the
easiest
drinking
tripel
ive
tasted
but
its
interesting
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
some
you
may
like
it
more
than
i
do
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
is
drinks
really
easy
not
a
hint
of
the
abv
present
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
some
white
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
smell
is
largely
of
some
belgian
yeast
a
bit
of
clove
and
some
pale
malt
notes
a
bit
of
fruit
there
too
taste
follows
suit
with
some
bigger
hop
notes
than
i
expectedsome
grass
and
leafyness
its
good
just
more
suited
to
the
bspa
category
than
tripel
not
fruity
enough
imo
decent
mf
a
little
lacking
in
the
creamyfilling
department
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carbonation
this
one
however
really
wins
on
the
drinkability
easy
drinker
with
wellmasked
abv
good
stuff
just
not
my
favorite
from
bells
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
the
grassiness
interferes
more
than
it
balances
to
me
still
a
well
made
beer
that
impresses
in
more
ways
than
it
doesnt
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
dont
know
that
i
would
drink
too
many
of
them
in
one
sitting
but
i
could
see
enjoying
one
or
two
with
friends
i
think
this
is
definitely
a
good
outdoor
beer
sitting
on
the
porch
or
around
a
campfire
doesnt
live
up
to
the
expectation
cultivated
by
bells
hopslam
or
stouts
but
was
solidly
enjoyable
pours
a
deep
dark
golden
color
with
a
good
three
inches
of
fluffy
white
head
good
traditional
tripel
aromas
of
white
pepper
belgian
yeast
and
some
light
lemony
citrus
nicely
carbonated
this
beer
is
sweet
crisp
malty
nicely
hopped
with
just
a
bit
of
drying
alcohol
coming
through
in
the
end
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
an
average
white
head
not
inspiring
but
appearance
isnt
everything
with
beer
fortunately
the
rich
fruity
slightly
yeasty
and
slightly
sweet
aroma
promises
much
better
flavor
is
fruity
and
yeasty
a
bit
sweet
a
bit
bitter
with
just
a
touch
of
butterscotch
flavor
is
quite
smooth
and
fairly
tingly
thanks
to
kstrickler
for
the
trade
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
style
doesnt
quite
pull
together
for
greatness
booze
warmth
syruppyness
slow
me
down
more
than
normal
for
the
style
drinkability
is
pretty
high
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
d
flavors
are
very
light
for
a
tripel
typically
i
expect
things
to
be
a
bit
more
intense
this
is
very
easy
drinking
too
easy
drinking
for
a
tripel
cant
believe
this
is
9
this
is
belgian
in
style
but
definitely
not
up
to
true
belgian
examples
notes
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
am
glad
that
i
got
a
sixpack
i
would
like
to
say
that
a
beer
with
this
high
of
gravity
that
goes
down
as
nicely
as
this
one
could
be
a
problem
bells
said
this
an
american
tripel
so
i
wonder
if
that
is
why
there
is
a
lack
of
spiciness
i
usually
expect
spices
at
the
forefront
in
a
tripel
but
it
was
not
to
be
in
this
brew
still
a
very
solid
brew
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
what
this
beer
was
about
to
me
it
is
very
crisp
and
clean
this
beer
really
has
a
stunning
appearance
d
tastes
like
a
decent
trip
but
is
carbonated
very
interesting
blend
fairly
large
in
body
but
accented
with
forward
mouthfeel
wish
i
could
be
more
descriptive
but
getting
over
a
minor
cold
is
killing
me
even
so
my
senses
were
awoken
by
this
beer
very
good
overall
while
a
decent
enough
beer
its
just
not
my
thing
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
this
out
again
as
this
isnt
one
of
bells
best
beers
this
is
crystal
clear
and
pale
orange
with
no
head
it
has
a
phenolic
aroma
with
a
little
underlying
honey
and
green
fruit
it
tastes
like
red
apple
with
spicy
phenols
and
esters
and
a
light
effervescent
body
its
funky
for
a
tripel
more
saisonlike
i
always
check
the
abv
before
choosing
my
drinkability
score
i
literally
just
said
out
loud
damn
nine
percent
a
definitely
unique
beer
although
not
my
first
choice
not
la
fin
du
monde
but
still
a
tasty
and
satisfying
beer
drinkability
nice
beer
not
bad
for
american
belgian
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
pours
golden
with
very
slight
haze
nicely
capped
by
a
white
foamy
layer
nose
has
some
interesting
lighter
fruits
such
as
apple
or
maybe
pear
and
bread
dough
palate
reveals
some
alcohol
warmth
and
sweet
candied
flavors
finish
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
very
similar
to
champagne
in
flavor
but
quite
a
bit
heavier
and
not
nearly
as
carbonated
not
really
my
style
of
beer
but
i
much
more
prefer
this
to
champagne
so
i
would
possibly
go
for
one
of
these
again
on
special
occasions
drinkability
not
bad
again
not
the
biggest
of
tripel
fans
but
this
is
decent
and
not
overly
sweet
its
pretty
damned
yeasty
though
and
dangerously
drinkable
considering
the
alcohol
is
nonexistent
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
had
this
at
a
microbrew
fest
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
smells
quite
citrussy
with
hints
of
hop
this
had
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
citrus
bite
tasted
a
little
fruity
but
not
too
much
tastes
very
good
easy
to
drink
hard
to
believe
it
is
9
nicely
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
slows
you
a
bit
too
sweet
for
a
tripel
as
far
as
im
concerned
not
bad
but
ill
stick
with
tripel
karmeliet
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
tripel
and
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
bells
ill
pick
something
else
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
while
not
having
a
tremendously
complex
flavor
it
still
tastes
pretty
good
im
sure
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
but
its
still
pretty
good
and
id
have
it
again
maybe
only
a
couple
at
a
time
as
i
feel
the
alcohol
could
sneak
up
on
you
the
flavors
of
fruit
were
noticed
and
the
tinge
of
high
alcohol
was
present
but
overall
quite
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
d
all
in
all
not
my
favorite
tripel
ive
had
but
by
no
means
the
worst
it
is
definitely
one
you
could
easily
have
a
few
of
for
the
alcohol
content
and
the
decent
flavor
this
is
a
decent
choice
note
i
guess
bells
has
started
filtering
this
beer
cos
i
dont
see
any
cloudiness
that
some
other
reviewers
have
noted
d
this
is
one
tripel
i
could
have
glass
after
glass
of
very
well
brewed
and
supremely
enjoyable
d
kind
of
a
bland
beer
actually
it
has
some
flavors
smells
that
fits
into
the
style
but
overall
a
disappointing
representation
of
what
makes
a
great
tripel
not
one
of
bells
best
efforts
very
drinkable
america
tripel
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
for
a
9
brew
definitely
one
i
would
be
willing
to
drink
a
couple
in
a
sitting
overall
very
ok
loosely
knit
had
of
multiple
bubble
sizes
huge
upon
the
pour
but
settles
down
into
a
half
finger
of
dimpled
white
foam
highly
credible
amount
of
lacing
left
behind
perfectly
clear
pumpkin
orange
color
yellows
some
around
the
rims
kinda
looks
like
a
cheap
adjunct
lager
the
nose
couldnt
smell
any
different
than
what
it
looks
like
sweet
fig
apricot
date
pear
fruit
orange
juice
bakers
yeast
some
wet
hop
herbaceous
notes
the
ginger
coriander
spice
a
touch
lower
than
expected
still
here
it
fits
the
beer
type
mediumbodied
extremely
smooth
and
fluid
the
carbonation
subtle
and
makes
no
sudden
moves
pepper
lifts
the
ginger
coriander
allspice
not
that
sweet
overall
peach
apricot
pear
takes
precedence
over
date
or
fig
the
orange
and
lemon
citrus
on
the
dry
side
leaves
plenty
of
room
for
the
moss
forest
floor
earth
the
breadiness
and
honey
most
apparent
through
the
finish
seems
like
a
take
on
a
style
within
the
house
idiom
which
is
interesting
but
not
to
be
confused
with
the
original
d
im
quite
the
fan
of
some
of
the
big
belgian
tripels
and
maybe
im
being
a
little
harsh
on
bells
because
i
was
expecting
more
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
it
just
cant
hold
a
candle
to
its
belgian
brethren
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
a
standout
to
the
tripel
aficianado
d
not
a
very
good
tripel
overall
misses
on
multiple
style
points
with
high
alcohol
presence
thick
syrupy
feel
light
aroma
and
metallic
aftertaste
i
imagine
its
filtered
now
as
the
yeast
profile
is
low
and
the
slightly
hazy
appearance
with
some
suspended
yeast
described
in
older
reviews
is
not
there
in
the
nowadays
version
cant
say
i
find
anything
exceptional
about
this
save
for
its
very
well
carbonated
flavor
goes
about
halfway
into
tripel
territory
but
falls
short
of
the
complexity
that
defines
the
style
overall
not
bad
at
all
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
with
just
a
tinge
too
much
sweetness
for
me
but
good
mouthfeel
is
sparkling
as
the
name
indicates
but
actually
not
too
carbed
drinkbility
was
good
i
enjoyed
this
yeasty
flavor
can
be
a
little
overwhelming
at
times
though
mouthfeel
is
a
slight
weight
to
it
not
exactly
light
bodied
but
less
than
medium
bodied
very
crisp
carbonation
keeps
each
sip
fresh
i
have
a
tendency
to
ignore
tripels
which
is
why
i
often
miss
out
on
tasty
beers
like
this
eric
very
easy
to
drink
and
high
abv
beer
from
my
hometown
i
have
cellared
this
for
a
year
previously
and
just
added
one
to
my
cellar
d
good
drinkability
for
the
style
i
finished
the
somewhat
large
glass
within
about
10
minutes
4
0
this
is
pretty
decent
but
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
trappist
instances
of
the
style
d
a
nice
example
of
the
tripel
style
from
a
brewery
that
typically
only
does
the
english
side
of
things
worth
a
shot
but
not
worth
seeking
out
the
brew
is
enjoyable
and
is
probably
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
an
american
tripel
there
are
better
trips
out
there
but
this
one
isnt
too
bad
really
enjoyable
flavors
in
this
beer
match
with
a
light
effervescent
body
that
makes
it
immensely
drinkable
the
8
2
abv
is
only
an
afterthought
in
the
warming
sensation
that
develops
in
my
cheeks
overtime
the
fruity
esters
provide
some
syrupy
sweetness
that
combines
well
with
the
depth
of
the
toasted
almost
cracked
tasting
malts
theres
a
clear
tart
bitterness
that
matches
perfectly
well
with
the
bright
bubbliness
of
the
beer
the
aftertaste
hints
at
caramel
and
the
sweet
stickiness
of
apricots
and
raisins
finish
is
slightly
dry
despite
a
subtle
sticky
coating
on
the
tongue
as
i
said
before
the
finish
is
super
dry
and
leaves
a
spicy
character
on
my
palate
very
easy
drinking
and
this
could
probably
sneak
up
on
you
d
its
an
easy
drinker
for
the
style
i
plan
on
putting
a
few
back
during
the
christmas
and
new
years
celebrations
it
might
not
be
quite
up
to
the
authentic
belgian
counterparts
though
i
dont
know
that
its
supposed
to
be
i
think
larry
was
going
for
an
american
take
on
the
style
then
again
its
a
lot
more
affordable
than
most
of
the
imports
very
solid
beer
the
primary
flavor
i
get
is
banana
bread
with
a
certain
sour
element
like
its
slightly
moldy
there
is
a
creamy
aspect
to
the
flavor
as
well
that
goes
nicely
with
the
banana
but
the
body
imo
is
too
thin
for
this
style
and
overall
i
feel
as
if
this
has
good
flavors
but
not
enough
to
carry
this
through
to
being
a
great
triple
although
its
a
good
introduction
and
they
do
call
it
an
american
triple
well
carbonated
and
a
full
medium
body
very
nice
drinker
not
a
great
tripel
but
a
good
one
d
easy
to
drink
with
a
deceptively
high
abv
another
quality
beer
from
bells
glad
to
see
this
one
on
my
shelf
finally
taste
more
cloves
and
bubblegum
clove
aspect
comes
through
stronger
in
the
taste
leaves
my
mouth
with
a
sweet
syrupy
feel
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
very
slightly
clouded
gold
with
a
minimal
white
head
very
doughforward
nose
spices
are
there
but
not
as
strong
much
more
of
the
spice
on
the
flavor
as
it
really
kicks
on
that
first
sip
and
stays
throughout
feel
is
about
typical
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
tripel
even
though
the
level
of
spice
character
is
high
decent
d
this
one
has
a
strange
taste
on
the
end
that
im
not
too
fond
of
ive
definitely
had
better
tripels
coughla
fin
du
mondecough
this
shows
potential
but
if
they
did
bump
up
the
quality
we
wouldnt
see
it
being
affordable
anymore
md
mediumfull
body
pretty
surprising
actually
notes
of
alcohol
carbonation
is
champagne
like
and
provides
a
nice
fizzy
sensation
on
the
tongue
pretty
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
like
this
beer
as
a
thirst
quencher
i
find
it
hard
as
a
seasonal
i
guess
its
only
claim
for
seasonal
is
the
champagne
like
bubbliness
and
dryness
and
it
certainly
delivers
in
that
department
an
interesting
drink
and
id
be
happy
to
have
more
in
future
but
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
looking
for
it
notes
nothing
spectacular
but
a
great
interpretation
of
a
tripel
overall
a
pretty
good
tripel
poured
a
light
brown
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
floating
in
the
beer
smells
malty
with
a
little
fruity
sweetness
the
taste
was
initially
very
malty
as
the
beer
warmed
i
got
a
little
bit
of
a
citrus
aftertaste
it
leaves
a
very
yeasty
sweet
taste
in
the
mouth
after
the
drink
goes
down
very
well
and
is
a
very
good
tripel
rich
creamy
head
that
dissapates
quickly
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
gently
citrusorange
with
hints
of
spice
the
taste
is
rich
and
the
high
alcohol
level
is
apparent
almost
numbing
the
tongue
fruity
with
a
nice
aftertaste
with
a
slight
hop
tinge
reminds
me
of
a
fin
du
monde
pretty
good
stuff
but
a
little
pricy

bottle
purchased
at

in

for

into
my
maredsous
chalice
and
appears
a
slightly
hazed
golden

color
with
about
an

as

apples
and
grapes
bready
malt
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
crisp
and
quenching
with

d
pretty
nice
and
refreshing
a
nice
gateway
beer
for
those
wishing
to
try
a
belgian
triple
but
are
afraid
of
the
bigger
funkier
ones
drinkability
that
biting
aftertaste
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
overall
very
drinkable
however
with
a
slightly
higher
alcohol
content
youll
be
feeling
it
more
after
just
one
than
your
average
beer
d
something
i
could
drink
a
few
of
tasty
mellow
and
very
refreshing
if
they
were
trying
for
champaign
then
they
failed
but
they
did
make
a
great
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
delicious
belgium
treat
i
love
bells
and
i
love
this
beer
it
is
over
a
year
old
but
it
tastes
pretty
fresh

me

i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
when
i
tried
this
but
what
i
found
was
a
nice
little
tripel
i
could
probably
see
myself
getting
this
from
time
to
time
md
very
interesting
beer
i
cant
say
i
love
it
but
i
did
enjoy
trying
it
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
but
the
sweetness
might
have
overdone
it
for
me
notes
this
ale
is
not
as
clear
and
pretty
as
some
of
the
other
triples
also
the
taste
is
sort
heavy
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
tripel
there
are
other
examples
of
this
style
i
enjoy
more
notes
from
3306
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
the
tripel
style
it
doesnt
have
anything
thats
too
in
your
face
about
it
has
a
nice
light
sweet
taste
to
it
and
the
higher
alcohol
is
hardly
evident
while
its
not
the
best
tripel
ive
had
i
thought
this
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
pours
a
sligtly
hazy
golden
color
with
no
head
it
smells
sweet
and
malty
there
are
hints
of
apples
as
well
as
booze
it
has
a
pretty
light
body
and
a
nice
light
carbonation
it
tastes
very
heavy
though
even
syrupy
the
sweetness
and
booziness
stand
out
d
great
taste
and
mouthfeel
bells
rocks
d
this
is
not
the
best
tripel
i
have
had
or
even
in
the
top
5
north
american
interpretations
of
the
style
that
said
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
certainly
worth
a
try
before
bells
impending
discontinuation
of
sparkling
ale
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
sediment
floating
throughout
the
fluffy
white
head
receded
to
a
bubbly
cap
leaving
no
lacing
yeasty
smell
with
hints
of
fruits
mainly
bananas
and
some
candied
sugar
hints
of
spices
are
present
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
up
front
with
a
definite
banana
flavor
which
gives
way
to
the
yeasty
backbone
in
the
middle
the
spices
are
present
but
subtle
in
the
taste
as
well
leaving
a
little
kick
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
maybe
a
tad
thin
with
good
carbonation
this
is
not
the
best
or
most
complex
tripel
ive
had
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
quite
drinkable
damn
glad
i
picked
this
stuff
up
its
a
shame
they
are
retiring
it
tastewise
i
actually
think
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
the
allagash
tripel
the
only
downside
is
all
those
floaters
in
the
beer
it
still
tastes
good
though
if
you
see
this
stuff
i
would
recommend
getting
some
before
its
gone
for
good
well
rounded
and
worth
seeking
out
i
want
more
mk
pretty
drinkable
for
its
strength
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
at
all
it
never
fails
to
amaze
me
that
so
many
excellent
american
brewers
seem
absolutely
incapable
of
making
good
belgian
knock
offs
rogues
no
good
at
it
three
floyds
is
no
good
at
it
and
now
bells
is
no
good
at
it
this
beer
isnt
horrible
its
not
or
even
bad
but
its
not
up
to
snuff
with
what
you
expect
from
a
brewery
of
this
caliber
addition
had
a
2007
bottle
in
august
of
2009
and
the
flavor
was
not
as
good
sort
of
biscuity
and
plain
d
one
glass
at
8
2
is
more
than
enough
drinkability
high
abv
but
its
not
harsh
or
hidden
poorly
a
fairly
dry
and
interesting
tripel
call
it
an
american
interpretation
thats
not
outstanding
but
thats
definitely
unique
and
worthy
of
picking
up
a
sixer
give
it
a
shot
d
great
triple
not
too
heavy
on
the
spicing
great
flavor
and
balance
deceptively
strong
but
still
very
drinkable
matter
of
fact
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
want
more
of
this
beer
the
higher
alcohols
and
fusels
get
to
be
a
bit
much
at
times
they
actually
almost
give
me
a
headache
a
decent
beer
that
seems
to
be
lacking
some
depth
actually
if
it
wasnt
for
the
hotness
of
this
beer
it
would
be
quite
enjoyable
and
flavorful
d
a
great
american
take
on
the
tripel
although
it
would
be
an
average
belgian
version
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
another
impressive
beer
from
bells
good
beer
overall
but
if
the
flavor
matched
the
nose
it
could
have
been
great
reminds
me
a
lot
of
batch
8000
but
more
balanced
with
a
toned
down
sweetandspiciness
and
more
citrus
more
bitter
than
a
typical
tripel
but
its
done
well
different
and
worth
a
try
for
sure
all
in
all
a
very
nice
tripel
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
pours
an
awesome
yellow
with
some
serious
suspension
in
the
glass
hold
it
up
to
sunlight
to
see
what
i
mean
this
is
about
the
best
thing
i
enjoyed
about
this
beer
smell
has
that
belgium
smell
with
nice
fragrance
coming
from
the
nose
very
sweet
with
hints
of
lemon
and
outdoor
freshness
taste
to
me
was
pretty
difficult
the
alcohol
was
very
present
and
hard
for
me
to
drink
this
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
mess
like
a
nice
hefe
with
a
strong
weird
alcohol
grape
taste
in
there
boy
was
this
a
mess
well
to
put
it
midly
bells
brews
some
of
the
best
beers
imo
in
the
world
this
is
not
up
there
d
nice
take
on
a
tripel
but
im
not
overly
impressed
alcohol
is
a
little
too
strong
and
overall
taste
is
little
too
cloying
and
earthy
like
most
bells
beers
i
like
it
but
dont
love
it
d
its
decent
but
probably
wont
be
getting
it
again
i
had
one
of
these
it
was
very
nice
i
could
probably
go
for
one
more
but
then
its
time
for
something
else
not
bad
for
a
triple
better
head
and
a
fuller
body
would
be
nice
but
its
still
worth
a
try
overall
impression
wow
i
was
thinking
this
was
a
blonde
ale
boy
was
i
wrong
american
triple
ok
i
can
see
that
belgian
yeast
characteristics
save
the
day
for
me
on
this
one
the
alcohol
is
heady
and
heavy
handed
and
go
a
bit
fusel
making
this
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
some
really
nice
flavors
i
think
it
would
cellar
nicely
which
makes
dating
all
the
more
important
drinkability
chalk
this
one
up
as
another
domestic
failure
to
pull
off
a
belgian
tripel
for
some
reason
this
style
gives
our
better
brewers
fits
bright
gold
with
a
little
head
and
enough
floaties
to
make
the
glass
look
like
a
glass
snow
globe
that
you
shake
up
lots
of
sediment
sweet
fruity
aroma
kind
of
thick
and
sweet
in
the
mouth
just
like
this
style
is
supposed
to
be
reminds
me
of
that
bananaapricotclove
sort
of
taste
that
la
fin
du
monde
has
good
beer
hard
to
tell
its
8
2
abv
more
carbonation
might
have
made
it
easier
to
drink
and
gave
it
a
better
more
pleasing
appearance
as
well
otherwise
it
was
an
average
tripel
at
best
paired
this
with
chicken
satay
it
went
okay
but
was
too
sweet
and
powerfully
flavored
for
the
lighter
accompaniments
of
steamed
veggies
and
rice
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
but
balanced
out
by
the
carbonation
i
did
expect
a
bit
more
carbonation
by
the
description
on
the
bottle
but
this
is
actually
closer
to
the
style
i
guess
nice
to
try
one
but
not
a
beer
or
style
id
go
to
often
drinkability
not
the
greatest
both
the
high
abv
and
the
high
oxidation
content
make
it
a
bit
difficult
to
choke
down
a
6
pack
of
it
being
that
this
is
the
last
one
i
have
though
it
was
pretty
easy
to
put
down
12oz
another
winner
by
bells
overall
we
all
know
that
bells
can
make
wonderful
beers
and
i
guess
i
can
add
triple
to
the
styles
that
they
have
perfected
it
is
one
of
the
better
triples
brewed
outside
belgium
bells
has
another
winner
with
this
one
as
i
venture
thru
their
beer
list
i
become
more
and
more
amazed
as
i
drink
beer
after
beer
style
after
style
bottle
courtesy
of
unclemattie
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
ester
with
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
interesting
fruity
ester
some
sweet
malt
which
may
include
some
wheat
full
body
with
some
great
carbonation
but
some
light
alcoholic
phenol
which
were
not
too
upfront
while
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
it
lacked
some
complexity
and
subtlety
thanks
to
rblwthacoz
for
the
sample
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
with
some
beautiful
carbonation
quite
drinkable
despite
the
abv
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
bells
sparkling
ale
pours
a
stiff
finger
of
white
foam
over
a
slightly
cloudy
tea
colored
brew
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
suspended
particulate
matter
but
this
is
a
belgian
styled
beer
after
all
carbonation
is
steady
and
the
nose
is
fruity
and
spicy
also
quite
typical
of
the
style
the
flavor
is
bright
light
malts
backing
up
against
crisp
herbal
hops
with
again
notes
of
fruit
clove
and
grain
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
a
bit
dry
i
went
to
the
bells
website
and
entering
this
beers
batch
number
8204
discovered
that
it
was
bottled
on
november
15
2007
and
the
alcohol
by
volume
not
listed
on
the
bottle
was
a
delightful
9
for
all
its
lightness
of
body
and
flavor
bells
did
a
fine
job
controlling
that
alcohol
burn
it
only
makes
itself
felt
as
a
warming
effect
this
is
why
bells
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
get
it
if
you
can
but
be
careful
it
really
sneaks
up
on
you
poured
from
bottle
into
flute
golden
hue
with
high
carbonation
and
sediment
almost
no
head
first
sign
of
trouble
smell
is
lemoncitrus
taste
adds
spice
and
maybe
coriander
but
is
much
weaker
than
anticipated
for
a
selfstyled
tripelthis
is
one
of
the
weaker
versions
on
the
positive
side
it
is
light
and
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
but
i
expect
more
from
bells
quality
should
try
might
buy
again
drinkability
yikes
a
decent
experiment
i
suppose
or
one
that
shouldve
been
but
id
stick
to
the
other
failsafe
bells
brews
i
was
curious
about
this
from
the
beginning
because
i
wasnt
sure
with
what
their
brewing
staples
are
why
and
how
and
if
they
could
pull
this
off
and
i
wouldnt
want
to
try
this
again
thankfully
i
just
got
the
one
bottle
go
for
a
4pack
of
an
import
or
a
nice
corked
and
caged
belgian
cheers
to
branching
out
but
not
if
its
going
to
be
a
seemingly
mediocre
attempt
drinkability
no
thanks
cloying
and
somewhat
of
a
chore
to
finish
the
single
bottle
got
this
one
in
the
bottle
at
the
brickskeller
in
dc
pours
a
very
little
yellowish
color
clear
with
tons
of
bubbles
nose
is
good
wheaty
with
a
lot
of
bubblegummy
fruitiness
taste
is
likewise
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
along
with
wheat
spices
corriander
a
nice
flavor
although
not
one
that
really
blows
me
away
like
a
lot
of
tripels
ive
had
feel
is
highly
carbonated
which
i
guess
is
the
point
although
i
prefer
a
tripel
a
little
more
mellow
overall
its
a
tasty
beer
although
it
doesnt
really
blow
me
away
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
brew
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
solid
pale
malt
scent
along
with
an
earthyfruity
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
full
flavored
pale
malt
taste
that
goes
down
smooth
and
silky
with
little
warmth
the
yeast
provides
a
fruitiness
as
well
as
a
dry
earthy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
a
fine
take
on
the
tripel
style
but
its
far
from
the
best
around
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
thin
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
aroma
is
an
abundant
blend
of
spice
belgian
yeast
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
for
the
style
but
the
yeast
and
spice
are
not
far
behind
at
all
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
a
decent
amount
of
warming
alcohol
this
is
yet
another
enjoyable
beer
from
bells
certainly
the
best
american
tripel
available
in
sixpacks
ive
had
yet
d
pretty
good
this
one
would
be
a
great
starter
for
people
who
are
interested
in
trying
to
get
in
to
belgiums
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
good
around
8
seems
good
for
this
beer
its
smooth
and
pretty
drinkable
overall
its
solid
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
far
from
bad
pours
a
very
slightly
clouded
gold
with
a
minimal
white
head
very
doughforward
nose
spices
are
there
but
not
as
strong
much
more
of
the
spice
on
the
flavor
as
it
really
kicks
on
that
first
sip
and
stays
throughout
feel
is
about
typical
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
tripel
even
though
the
level
of
spice
character
is
high
decent
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
nice
interpretation
of
a
belgian
ale
overall
my
least
favorite
from
bells
which
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
im
much
more
an
american
hop
guy
than
a
belgian
tripel
guy
so
please
take
my
opinion
with
a
grain
of
salt
this
tripel
from
bells
is
delicious
and
quite
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
8
alcohol
so
be
careful
theyll
sneak
up
on
you
didnt
realize
it
was
8
alcohol
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
it
i
was
slightly
disappointed
with
this
bells
offering
as
i
really
enjoy
most
of
their
offerings
kind
of
sweet
this
was
a
subpar
belgian
in
my
opinion
but
a
nice
effort
8
abv
so
the
drinkability
is
somewhat
low
but
arent
most
belgians
just
a
bit
off
overall
to
me
light
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
pleasant
aroma
of
yeast
sugar
bubblegum
and
coriander
flavor
is
the
same
but
this
is
not
as
sweet
which
is
great
it
has
more
body
and
silkiness
leaving
more
complex
and
lush
flavors
without
the
extra
sugar
rush
this
almost
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
saison
and
a
tripel
i
actually
went
into
this
with
a
skeptical
attitude
sparkling
ale
huh
but
this
here
is
proof
that
serious
quality
can
overcome
prejudice
when
it
pleads
its
case
well
some
prophecies
are
not
always
fulfilled
by
the
self
d
no
session
beer
sweetness
and
booze
are
too
much
im
not
a
huge
tripel
fan
but
this
is
pretty
good
better
than
average
probably
but
nothing
amazing
d
okay
a
good
flavor
but
a
bit
much
for
every
day
drinking
a
nice
treat
however
im
a
sucker
for
packaging
the
label
and
description
had
me
salivating
for
a
light
bubbly
effervescent
beer
it
does
compare
itself
to
champagne
but
then
it
also
calls
itself
a
tripel
first
nothing
sparkling
going
on
here
these
are
still
waters
dark
gold
some
yeasty
haze
and
a
tight
white
head
that
is
coaxed
back
up
with
gentle
swirling
smells
are
strong
up
front
alcohol
and
yeast
at
first
i
was
not
taken
with
the
taste
but
i
appreciated
this
beer
much
more
once
the
2nd
bottle
had
warmed
up
a
bit
characteristics
of
a
wit
and
a
saison
are
both
present
sweetness
of
a
tripel
is
dominant
but
never
cloying
alcohol
is
present
but
never
offensive
mouthfeel
is
this
beers
strongest
point
smooth
and
delicious
making
this
beer
much
more
drinkable
than
the
aggressive
flavor
profile
would
lead
you
to
believe
not
the
beer
that
i
was
expecting
but
i
must
say
i
like
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
yellow
with
small
yet
fluffy
head
the
nose
is
very
yeasty
and
wheaty
smells
like
a
witbier
wow
wonderful
triple
flavors
awesome
yeast
and
wheat
flavor
with
a
touch
of
banana
on
the
finish
nice
and
creamy
and
very
very
belgian
in
character
the
mouthfeel
is
flawless
i
beleive
this
is
a
wonderful
tripel
incredibly
drinkable
and
by
a
ways
the
most
belgian
tasting
american
made
tripel
i
have
tried
as
of
yet
mad
props
to
jcb
for
this
inclusion
very
very
good
i
am
jealous
of
those
with
easy
access
to
this
sparkling
ale
aint
a
standout
but
its
pretty
solid
easy
to
drink
and
an
easy
introduction
to
the
style
for
folks
getting
started
down
the
shining
path
er
sparkling
path
well
whatever
path
leads
into
an
appreciation
of
tripels
this
is
a
decent
first
step
crisp
and
spicy
with
a
medium
body
some
citrus
a
little
alcohol
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
abv
maybe
a
little
too
easy
ill
look
forward
to
drinking
this
again
next
winter
overall
this
is
a
pretty
easygoing
take
on
the
triple
style
something
id
drink
again
drinkability
very
good
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
at
any
time
not
just
winter
good
complexity
and
very
smooth
definitely
worth
seeking
this
one
out
d
strong
brew
im
having
this
in
my
early
sunday
afternoon
i
may
have
to
nap
afterwards
seems
like
good
beer
to
quaff
after
a
day
at
the
slopes
sit
by
the
fire
and
enjoy
one
then
have
a
hearty
dinner
then
take
off
your
skies
and
throw
them
in
the
fire
medium
bodied
easy
enough
to
drink
with
a
good
carbonation
level
and
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
at
the
end
not
quite
up
to
a
good
belgian
tripel
but
still
a
good
effort
i
got
this
bells
offering
on
tap
at
the
brew
kettle
on
122807
it
came
to
me
a
bit
on
the
cold
side
and
in
a
cool
looking
tulip
glass
this
bells
was
a
hazy
tangerine
color
with
a
small
tint
of
amber
it
could
have
been
the
shape
of
the
glass
but
it
had
a
minimal
head
of
white
foam
with
decent
retention
that
left
behind
a
hand
full
of
small
white
rings
and
few
small
white
streaks
of
lace
the
smell
was
heavy
with
belgian
yeast
behind
that
heavy
yeast
aroma
was
some
juicy
fruits
floral
hops
and
a
slice
of
banana
the
taste
was
very
belgian
like
the
taste
was
fruity
with
juicy
fruits
belgian
yeast
dry
citrus
hops
a
pinch
of
toasted
malts
and
just
a
dab
of
sweet
banana
the
mouthfeel
was
very
slick
it
completely
masked
its
8
2
abv
the
aftertaste
was
that
of
bitter
citrus
hops
and
belgian
yeast
this
aftertaste
was
not
long
lasting
but
still
very
good
its
not
my
favorite
bells
beer
but
it
was
a
nice
take
on
a
belgian
style
of
beer
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
chimay
chalice
wow
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
the
first
beer
from
bells
that
i
didnt
completely
enjoy
i
knew
that
day
would
come
but
i
didnt
think
it
would
be
today
poured
a
hazy
golden
with
lots
of
suspended
yeast
it
had
a
big
head
that
disappeared
quickly
left
no
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
maltiness
with
bananas
and
spices
taste
is
strong
on
bananas
and
yeasts
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
dry
i
can
see
how
many
people
would
like
this
beer
just
not
me
nice
golden
color
with
a
fine
white
head
lots
of
suspended
yeast
floating
around
some
fruity
smells
and
a
lot
of
sweet
maltyness
as
it
warms
the
8
2
shows
itself
to
the
front
with
the
phenol
burn
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
taste
of
banana
and
butterscotch
malty
at
first
but
then
the
abv
comes
to
the
front
this
one
turns
into
a
real
sipper
not
sure
that
the
name
sparkling
really
fits
this
one
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
nice
clear
golden
color
but
a
pitiful
head
aromas
of
golden
apples
pear
lemon
rind
and
butterscotch
malt
all
carried
by
a
moderate
alcohol
ester
fruit
flavor
is
about
the
same
as
the
aroma
with
a
some
floral
spicy
herbal
hop
characters
for
depth
yeasts
offering
the
usual
tripel
phenols
and
the
malts
have
a
buttery
nutty
character
and
develops
a
touch
of
salty
as
it
warms
medium
bodied
and
subdued
yet
enjoyable
carbonation
is
still
better
than
the
pour
had
shown
pretty
good
tripel
for
an
american
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
light
white
head
some
lacing
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
and
banana
nice
mouthfeel
with
about
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
flavor
has
a
lot
of
apricot
and
banana
in
it
with
that
belgian
yeasty
aftertaste
yet
another
solid
bells
offering
oelergud
md
heavier
than
thought
carbonation
is
just
right
but
for
a
sparkling
ale
you
would
think
there
would
be
more
drinkability
is
ok
i
could
have
another
but
not
if
i
had
another
tripel
option
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
pilsner
looking
and
i
was
excited
to
try
something
along
that
line
from
this
great
company
head
was
good
and
white
smell
was
hoppy
the
taste
was
not
good
very
fruity
and
a
tad
sour
it
tasted
like
a
belgian
ale
to
me
which
im
not
all
that
fod
of
alcohol
was
over
the
top
also
if
you
like
belgian
sour
beers
abbey
then
try
this
however
i
will
not
try
it
again
i
think
larry
bell
did
a
fine
job
with
this
one
appearance
lacks
a
little
pale
golden
with
a
head
that
has
minimal
retention
and
little
lace
smells
is
great
sweet
bread
some
clove
spice
and
a
little
hop
just
like
a
tripel
should
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
st
bernardus
tripel
tastes
almost
the
same
maybe
it
should
get
more
points
mouthfeel
is
just
short
of
belgian
classic
i
know
they
call
it
bubbly
but
it
doesnt
seem
as
live
going
down
as
my
favorite
tripels
easy
drink
and
youd
never
know
it
was
an
8
abv
beer
overall
im
very
pleased
and
am
glad
that
an
american
made
a
belgian
style
beer
that
doesnt
suck
it
seems
like
bells
can
do
no
wrong
and
i
really
hope
they
keep
it
up
mouthfeel
is
light
verging
on
medium
light
enjoyable
i
could
drink
this
beer
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
for
the
style
i
think
this
just
gets
beat
on
all
fronts
though
brooklyn
local
1
is
a
better
american
belgian
style
beer
and
golden
monkey
comes
in
a
fairly
inexpensive
variety
case
with
hopdevil
prima
pils
and
v
lager
so
i
dont
know
if
i
will
return
to
this
but
it
is
good
and
definately
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
in
body
the
higher
levels
of
carbonation
are
appropriate
finish
is
dry
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
good
for
a
slow
sip
but
i
dont
think
this
is
one
ill
buy
again
there
are
many
others
that
ive
had
that
are
way
better
stylistically
speaking
overall
a
tripel
with
more
body
and
flavor
than
usual
more
of
a
heavyduty
witbier
very
solid
an
enjoyable
beer
this
sparkling
ale
is
just
that
the
beer
continues
to
bubble
as
it
sits
in
my
corsendonk
snifter
golden
in
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
its
crazy
how
the
bubbles
continue
to
flow
from
the
middle
of
the
glass
at
the
bottom
to
the
top
this
is
the
champagne
of
beers
smells
like
a
belgium
sweet
little
spice
with
a
mild
alcohol
taste
depending
on
temperature
definately
better
than
most
american
versions
of
a
tripel
when
you
look
through
the
glass
you
see
so
much
yeast
floating
around
maybe
thats
what
keeps
it
bubbling
smooth
mouthfeel
decent
lacing
all
in
all
a
very
well
crafted
intriguing
brew
from
bells
that
is
sure
to
please
i
didnt
see
any
bubbles
in
this
beer
when
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
so
make
sure
to
use
the
right
glass
the
ratings
i
gave
arent
the
greatest
but
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
like
it
better
than
victorys
golden
monkey
but
its
a
step
down
from
some
other
tripels
ive
had
the
strange
thing
was
the
lack
of
head
on
this
beer
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
fine
despite
the
appearance
surprisingly
full
bodied
and
higher
gravity
it
still
manages
to
have
a
clean
bright
finish
even
with
all
the
belgian
character
moderatehigh
carbonation
not
at
all
what
i
expected
a
very
nice
surprise
i
shouldnt
have
underestimated
bells
theyve
never
wronged
me
12
oz
single
into
a
wine
glass
its
golden
amber
appearance
is
surprising
and
looks
much
more
pale
than
belgian
tripels
taste
is
vastly
different
from
belgians
like
delirium
spice
cloves
and
coriander
up
front
and
dominant
noncitrus
fruits
make
it
taste
much
more
like
a
cider
than
a
tripel
but
it
certainly
is
drinkable
its
crisp
carbonation
and
light
body
feel
like
a
session
beer
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
but
its
worth
a
try
this
falls
far
from
its
genuine
counterpart
as
it
displays
no
complexity
it
is
light
and
refreshing
which
helps
me
forget
the
lack
of
depth
d
strong
but
tasty
not
the
best
tripel
or
one
of
the
more
memorable
offerings
from
bells
it
is
worth
a
try
though
not
terrible
but
not
great
either
i
suppose
its
ok
for
an
americanmade
tripel
but
thats
really
the
best
praise
i
can
give
it
i
cant
really
think
of
anything
horribly
wrong
with
it
its
just
very
average
there
are
better
options
available
d
if
you
put
the
appearance
part
aside
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
drinkable
dno
where
near
my
favorites
for
tripels
i
am
not
sure
if
it
was
a
bad
bottle
or
not
but
this
one
lacked
balance
overall
an
ok
trippel
its
a
little
sweeter
than
usual
the
flavors
just
rub
me
a
little
wrong
sorry
larry
but
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
hope
this
makes
its
way
to
the
shelves
here
in
nc
id
like
to
experimant
w
this
a
bit
more
i
have
a
bottle
of
this
well
over
a
year
and
a
half
in
age
in
the
cold
cellar
im
curious
to
see
how
it
will
pair
with
this
fresh
sample
guess
well
have
to
keep
waiting
until
another
special
occasion
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
creamy
with
prickly
alcoholcarbonation
a
sweet
film
coats
the
lips
d
this
is
my
first
tripel
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
i
did
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
possibly
the
cloudiest
hazyest
beer
ive
ever
had
lots
of
chunky
yeast
floaters
nice
rich
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
smells
like
a
funky
cider
some
pear
tart
and
sweetness
with
a
tart
almost
sour
aftertaste
biggest
downside
is
the
sweet
almost
cloying
mouthfeel
but
the
finish
is
dry
enough
to
make
it
dangerously
drinkable
probably
could
only
have
12
before
it
became
overpowering
but
this
one
is
disappearing
very
quickly
highly
recommend
letting
this
one
spend
some
time
alone
in
the
cellar
before
drinking
d
well
thats
different
too
bad
it
was
based
on
a
tripel
style
which
im
not
a
fan
of
but
i
like
the
concept
here
and
appreciate
the
effort
paid
1
99
for
a
single
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
peachygold
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
creamy
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
of
spicy
malt
slightly
fruity
and
if
you
try
really
hard
maybe
some
miniscule
amount
of
alcohol
well
hidden
the
alcohol
is
also
well
covered
in
the
taste
with
the
same
spicy
malt
flavor
and
a
decently
hoppy
finish
to
be
honest
the
first
drink
was
a
little
offputting
but
after
a
few
swigs
i
really
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
with
thick
creamy
carbonation
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
given
its
relatively
high
alcohol
content
overall
this
2
year
old
belgian
strong
ale
has
held
up
pretty
good
im
guessing
the
taste
is
probably
more
subdued
and
the
alcohol
has
overtaken
the
flavor
besides
the
palate
and
appearance
having
declined
again
im
guessing
the
flavors
are
still
there
in
enough
force
to
be
enjoyed
i
will
have
to
try
a
fresher
version
to
compare
not
so
drinkable
for
a
guy
that
doesnt
have
a
sweet
tooth
also
the
incessant
tartness
slowed
it
down
too
much
for
me
it
is
a
trippel
so
it
would
not
likely
be
considered
allnight
drinking
fare
still
it
is
a
very
smooth
and
exceptionally
pleasing
beverage
so
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
than
one
bright
golden
apricot
with
a
bold
slightly
hazy
core

strong
over

and
spicy

sweetness
rounds
out
more
sugary
with
increasing
heat
and
minty
bitterness
in
the
finish
yeast
is
noticeable
and
good
full
creamy
mouthfeel
that
coats
the
mouth
well
another
nice
ale
from
bells
nice
carbonation
but
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
a
tripel
that
hides
its
alcohol
under
its
sleeve
making
it
very
accesible
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
can
tell
there
was
definitely
quality
craftsmanship
involved
in
its
making
but
its
not
the
best
tripel
i
have
ever
had
while
i
like
this
it
probably
will
annoy
some
drinkers
that
strong
herbal
bitterness
could
get
annoying
after
a
while
or
under
the
wrong
circumstances
i
like
it
so
i
did
bump
the
drinkability
up
a
little
bit
m
smooth
and
drinkable
not
as
carbonated
as
i
had
thought
it
would
be
a
white
fluffy
head
sits
upon
an
apricot
tinged
sparkly
gold
body
in
a
white
wine
glass
at
maduro
head
is
lasting
and
carbonation
is
highly
active
and
very
appealing
to
the
eye
aromas
of
bready
yeasts
and
toasted
malts
form
a
base
under
a
peppery
spice
and
citric
finish
tastes
of
bread
and
toast
with
lemonlime
jam
pepper
and
just
a
hint
of
light
alcohol
feel
is
sparkling
mediumbodied
and
mildly
warming
drinkability
is
decent
but
the
alcohol
sugars
which
become
noticeable
when
the
beer
warms
to
room
temp
create
a
sweet
coating
on
my
palate
that
prohibits
me
from
drinking
more
than
two
glasses
overall
i
find
this
to
be
an
impressive
trippel
largely
because
it
grasps
subtlety
and
isnt
overly
sweet
tropical
or
banana
filled
as
so
many
american
trippels
are
d
drinkable
but
one
a
night
would
suffice
mouthfeel
dry
pallet
with
a
slight
tart
almost
bittersweet

is

this

a

kind
of
reminds

of

sediment
just
makes
it
look
cloudy
odor
is
mostly
a
european
hop
smell
with
some
pearapple
odors
too
not
a
massive
smack
of
flavor
like
i
expect
from
a
tripel
instead
a
smooth
pear
and
other
fruit
taste
with
hops
and
spices
that
is
very
mellow
and
tasty
mouthfeel
is
slightly
harsh
with
the
obvious
alcohol
zest
stinging
a
bit
this
last
also
hurts
the
drinkability
somewhat
overall
i
think
its
another
delicious
bells
treat
and
id
grad
some
more
if
i
ever
see
it
again
anywhere
i
bought
this
single
bottle
at
the
bells
general
store
in
kalamazoo
bells
belgianstyle
beer
pours
with
a
classic
tripel
color
and
lots
of
yeasty
cloudiness
the
smell
is
fairly
straightforward
with
white
fruits
and
some
spiciness
nutmeg
dominating
smells
like
a
tripel
on
the
palate
this
one
is
initially
quite
sweet
with
a
ton
of
candi
sugar
asserting
itself
followed
up
by
some
thick
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
this
one
drinks
as
one
of
the
better
american
tripels
but
not
up
to
the
standards

with
cloudy
golden
straw
body
and
tons
of
offwhite

wheaty
floral
slightly
lemony
and
a
hint

definitely
some
earthy

more
in

i
just
poured
badly
definitely
a
noticeable
level
of
fusels
i
suppose
its
not
too
hot
for
being
8
2
and
all
but
the
bite
does
affect
the
drinkability
a
bit
d
refreshing
and
definitely
complimentary
with
a
meal
very
good
representation
of
the
style
but
without
any
extraordinary
points
a
standup
american
belgianstyle
that
needs
some
refinement
to
measure
up
to
the
big
boys
but
like
others
have
said
this
measures
up
to
golden
monkey
and
other
similarly
semiaccurate
tripel
clones
taste
yeasty
and
spicy
with
coriander
and
touches
of
pepper
the
fruits
are
there
with
bananas
oranges
and
pineapple
the
malts
come
across
more
like
cookie
dough
instead
of
bread
dough
with
the
sweetness
that
the
beer
has
even
though
this
is
so
sweet
it
doesnt
come
across
as
cloying
in
my
opinion
with
juct
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
over
all
a
good
beer
its
not
quite
a
tripel
and
not
one
of
bells
best
but
still
a
good
beer
and
worth
the
buy
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
something
that
a
good
tripel
has
mbc
has
the
same
problem
with
there
tripel
i
think
they
have
to
much
body
thanks
for
sharing
mike
very
drinkable
though
it
does
taste
boozier
than
other
similar
beers
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
belgian
stong
pale
ale
a
good
sipper
went
well
with
my
lunchtime
sandwich
it
was
good
damn
good
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
revisit
this
again
ill
stick
to

porters

northyorksammy
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
rerate
extremely
bubbly
mouthfeel
with
loads
of
fruit
flavors
this
sample
is
a
bit
oxidized
but
still
very
tasty
hmmm
drinkability
how
do
rate
it
on
a
high
gravity
beer
pretty
easy
drinking
but
you
know
the
alcohol
is
there
please
dont
try
to
compare
to
a
pils
for
drinkability
d
for
a
sparkling
ale
this
has
the
smooth
light
qualities
but
there
were
just
a
few
off
notes
that
didnt
really
blend
with
the
flavor
and
aromas
very
drinkable
especially
for
none
ba
friends
mouthfeeel
is
dry
mildly
tropical

initial
foamy

full

be
quickly
drunk
cirtus
and

sweet
very
little
tartness
and
of
the
cheery
type
a
real
american
version
of
a
belgian
very
fresh
with
no
skunkiness
or
mouldy
yeast
i
dont
think
ive
met
a
triple
i
dont
like
and
this
is
no
exception
the
best
part
of
this
brew
is
the
color
a
magnificent
glowing
orange
copper
color
very
bright
very
hazy
with
a
slim
half
inch
white
fluffy
head
a
good
amount
of
delicate
lacing
smells
of
breads
yeasts
and
hints
of
bananas
taste
mimics
the
smell
very
subdued
flavors
of
breads
citrus
and
them
some
bananas
decent
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
finishes
clean
no
bitterness
whatsoever
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
not
a
factor
even
though
it
does
have
a
abv
of
8
2
worth
a
try
if
you
can
buy
a
single
bottle
on
tap
at
billys
lounge
the
beer
arrived
looking
like
a
golden
straw
coloured
brew
it
sported
a
little
head
of
white
and
left
some
sticky
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
was
heavy
on
candi
sugar
sweet
scents
and
belgian
yeast
qualities
the
taste
was
quite
sweet
and
candi
laden
it
almost
felt
gritty
very
tasty
this
had
just
a
bit
of
estery
banana
like
flavours
but
it
was
mainly
just
sugary
sweet
and
a
bit
spicy
it
did
have
a
pointy
white
grape
aspect
to
it
though
which
lent
a
sort
of
sharp
tartness
the
mouthfeel
felt
somewhat
syrupy
medium
in
body
if
i
must
say
so
drinkability
was
good
this
was
just
missing
something
that
i
cannot
put
my
finger
on
still
damn
good
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
tall
snowwhite
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
and
good
lacing
smell
is
strong
yeast
green
olive
and
clove
taste
is
sweet
candi
sugar
caramel
malt
belgian
spice
citrus
and
a
little
alcoholic
kick
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
a
little
thin
overall
a
pretty
good
belgiany
beer
not
sure
how
authentic
it
is
but
who
cares
its
tasty
enough
i
like
it
id
say
that
there
are
a
few
aspects
that
could
smoothed
out
and
the
flavor
could
use
a
little
something
extra
but
i
like
it
hard
to
judge
precisely
because
i
think
of
belgians
and
thats
tough
competition
havent
tried
anything
like
it
from
other
american
craft
brewers
abv
quite
warming
the
unbalanced
alcohol
makes
this
beer
not
real
drinkable
this
is
an
interesting
selection
from
bells
and
unique
in
its
own
way
for
a
tripel
it
pours
a
nice
light
orange
color
pretty
hazy
with
a
fairly
large
fluffy
and
lingering
white
head
fair
lacing
as
well
smells
of
yeast
and
fruitmostly
orange
and
citrus
im
very
impressed
by
the
full
sweet
and
balanced
aroma
here
the
taste
is
somewhat
puzzling
this
beer
is
a
lot
more
bitter
than
usual
with
the
style
and
this
bitterness
does
not
come
across
in
a
pleasant
way
although
the
yeast
and
fruit
notes
are
nice
there
is
an
overall
lack
of
complexity
in
the
mouth
bells
sparkling
ale
is
sharp
and
again
a
bit
bitter
carbonation
is
a
bit
above
normal
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
your
run
of
the
mill
tripel
but
then
again
no
where
near
as
good
as
the
best
of
the
style
a
nice
sippable
beer
though
not
particularly
smooth
for
a
belgiantype
12
ounce
bottle
bells
sparkling
ale
has
a
hazy
yellowish
brown
color
with
lots
of
floating
chunks
the
beer
is
topped
with
an
inch
of
dense
foam
bitter
orange
peel
aroma
along
with
strange
yeast
smells
this
beer
smells
disconcertingly
similar
to
the
beers
in
the
wheat
series
the
flavor
is
very
bitter
which
is
odd
for
the
style
bready
malt
some
hop
flavors
but
they
are
in
the
background
the
finish
is
yeasty
and
weird
a
decent
stab
at
a
tripel
but
there
are
some
extra
off
flavors
that
nearly
ruin
the
beer
for
me
another
good
beer
from
bells
brewing
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
a
good
beer
overall
keep
up
the
good
work
bells
an
imensely
rich
beer
that
is
easy
to
underestimate
a
beauty
to
the
sight
almost
bubbly
carbonation
and
fluffy
white
foamstand
very
bready
doughy
yeasty
and
fruity
to
the
nose
flavors
are
much
like
sugarcookie
dough
with
lots
of
citrus
lemon
flavors
reminescent
of
a
chardonay
or
champaign
in
its
flavors
textures
and
sweetness
active
and
vibrant
against
the
toung
with
a
mildly
fizzy
texture
finishes
warm
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
fusal
hotness
aftertaste
is
biteey
and
a
bit
harsh
but
fair
for
a
belgianlike
beer
good
stuff
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yet
bold
orange
color
the
head
is
small
and
white
but
recedes
ever
so
quickly
the
aroma
is
amazing
and
strong
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
la
fin
du
monde
oranges
yeast
dark
fruits
more
oranges
and
more
yeast
the
sip
is
of
oranges
with
a
dry
yeasty
finish
the
aftertaste
is
a
nice
warming
of
the
throat
by
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
the
taste
isnt
bad
but
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
complexity
to
it
yet
i
think
some
aging
would
mellow
out
the
orange
flavors
in
the
sip
and
allow
other
things
to
come
out
more
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
dry
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
decent
tripel
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
bells
a
handsome
exemplar
of
the
tripel
just
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
bells
be
sure
to
try
this
if
you
come
across
it
poured
from
12oz
bottle
looked
about
right
for
a
tripel
clear
golden
color
with
a
belgian
yeast
aroma
taste
and
smell
were
better
than
i
expected
based
on
varied
experience
with
bells
other
beers
the
main
drawback
for
me
is
the
name
on
the
bottle
sparkling
ale
it
sounds
like
a
spritzer
or
something
kind
of
embarassing
to
buy
anyway
the
taste
was
good
so
if
i
can
find
in
my
area
ill
pick
it
up
again
the
drinkability
seems
to
get
a
little
rough
after
a
few
sips
maybe
its
the
high
abv
or
maybe
the
slickfeeling
style
definitly
a
sipper
another
quality
offering
from
bells
cool
beer
and
a
fun
one
to
drink
one
of
the
few
beers
ive
had
that
overwhelms
its
relatively
pedestrian
taste
with
its
accoutrements
the
uh
bells
and
whistles
work
nicely
for
the
sparkling
ale
thanks
dirtylou
for
bringing
me
this
bottle
i
had
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
a
while
and
i
have
a
feeling
rileys
had
been
sitting
on
it
for
a
while
beforehand
luckily
it
held
up
pretty
strong
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
and
never
forgotten
a
joy
to
experience
the
name
is
somewhat
misleadingthis
tripel
style
is
not
very
sparkling
at
all
however
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
citrusy
and
smooth
the
aroma
is
actually
very
muted
not
alot
going
on
there
easy
drinking
which
is
dangerous
due
to
the
over
8
abv
the
yeasty
flecks
that
are
prominent
throughout
are
a
surprisethey
kind
of
freaked
my
wife
out
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
though
a
little
on
the
pricy
side
to
buy
very
often
this
beer
poured
with
a
big
white
head
that
slowly
dissipated
away
the
nose
was
spicy
redolent
with
pepper
warming
the
nose
became
yeasty
and
musty
the
color
was
a
sort
of
orangishyellow
with
flecks
of
yeast
swimming
throughout
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
creamy
with
a
taste
of
yeasty
spiciness
on
the
palate
the
finish
was
both
citrusy
and
chocolaty
like
one
of
those
milk
chocolate
oranges
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
high
abv
makes
me
hesitant
to
mark
drinkability
as
good
thanks
to
tastytaste
for
this
tasty
taste
treat
the
taste
is
good
has
a
bit
of
a
grainy
sweetness
from
the
malts
the
alcohol
is
quite
noticable
as
is
the
spicy
hop
in
the
finish
it
is
a
good
tripel
but
far
from
the
best
ive
tried
give
it
a
whirl
but
a
true
belgian
is
much
better
a
solid
brew
all
around
poured
out
to
a
nearly
clear
golden
color
with
good
carbonation
and
touches
of
lace
odors
of
yeast
and
herbs
were
noticed
as
were
a
sweet
alcohol
scent
taste
was
good
exciting
the
tastebuds
with
flavors
of
stronger
citrus
fruits
and
a
crispness
that
reminded
me
of
a
strong
hefewizen
finished
rather
crisp
with
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
bells
has
a
good
brew
here
recommended
pours
a
slightly
peachy
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
over
top
the
nose
is
nice
with
some
nice
orangey
citrus
character
with
some
banana
creamyness
and
some
spiceyness
hiding
behind
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
not
bad
either
a
nice
dose
of
banana
and
spices
with
a
slight
alcohol
spiceyness
in
the
back
i
like
it
the
feel
is
a
little
thin
at
moderate
with
a
creamy
texture
for
an
8
brew
this
is
a
keeper
i
enjoy
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
light
and
slightly
creamy
good
carbonation
allows
this
one
to
go
down
super
smooth
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
tripel
with
a
more
laid
back
flavor
profile
than
most
worth
a
try
but
if
i
want
a
tripel
i
will
probably
look
elsewhere
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
minimal
white
head
there
are
some
floaties
present
in
the
glass
interesting
aroma
of
fruits
lots
of
banana
some
bread
and
alcohol
crisp
taste
is
bursting
with
fruit
and
sweet
citrous
lots
of
yeasty
bready
characteristics
along
with
creamy
malt
form
a
doughy
backbone
for
the
sweetness
finish
is
a
great
blend
of
sweet
fruit
and
slightly
bitter
yet
definitely
dry
hops
a
little
alcoholic
burn
is
present
in
the
finish
as
well
creamy
mouthfeel
is
complimented
by
the
sweetness
yet
put
off
by
lots
of
carbonation
and
the
slight
sharpness
of
the
citrous
a
good
american
rendition
of
the
tripel
style
with
a
relatively
safe

abv
dark
golden
color
topped
by
a
minimal
white
head
nice
sweet
aroma
with
a
touch
of
spiciness
very
enticing
the
flavor
is
great
more
grand
crusaison
type
flavors
than
many
of
the
classic
tripels
tastes
like
coriander
bitter
orange
and
nice
malt
sweetness
maybe
a
touch
of
candi
sugar
as
well
alcohol
is
there
but
not
in
the
spotlight
mouthfeel
is
solid
yet
light
as
most
good
tripels
should
be
lighter
in
body
drinkability
is
debatable
the
higher
abv
and
the
prominent
flavors
would
likely
fatigue
the
palate
quickly
but
it
is
a
beer
you
could
look
forward
to
as
an
occasional
or
even
regular
treat
all
in
all
another
well
craft
beer
from
larry
and
the
gang
at
kalamazoo
awesome
beer
if
i
want
a
belgian
i
want
a
belgian
pale
and
man
this
hits
the
spot
another
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
wonderful
banana
berries
cloves
and
oranges
flavor
is
dominated
by
spice
mostly
clove
and
is
very
sweet
with
candi
sugar
some
ripe
fruits
come
through
in
the
middle
and
the
sugar
aftertaste
lingers
fullbodied
light
to
moderate
carbonation
and
warming
a
very
good
ale
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
this
is
nice
good
complexity
in
both
aroma
and
taste
but
especially
the
latter
not
as
impressive
as
some
of
the
other
offerings
from
bells
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
despite
the
relativly
high
abv
uncle
hamish
says
wines
fer
girls
and
the
blasted
italians
lads
move
on
the
bottle
implies
that
this
could
be
a
champagne
substitute
while
im
not
sure
about
that
its
certainly
worthy
of
toasting
not
one
of
the
bells
beers
that
gets
a
lot
of
notice
out
this
way
but
one
worth
sampling
this
brew
is
a
slightly
hazy
golden
colored
brew
with
some
suspended
yeast
bits
nice
foam
offwhite
head
the
scent
is
lemony
with
light
fruits
and
malt
sweet
matl
front
with
fruit
and
candy
subtle
bitter
hop
a
light
spicyness
full
creamy
mouth
overall
a
pretty
standard
tripel
heavy
sediment
visible
through
the
brown
glass
bottle
pours
with
a
gigantic
head
several
inches
at
first
heavy
yeast
sediment
in
the
glass
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
lingers
long
smells
of
alcohol
with
woody
earthy
flavors
yeasty
with
slight
clove
and
other
spice
smells
taste
is
also
very
earthy
and
woody
like
it
was
barrel
aged
very
dry
on
the
pallette
too
body
is
very
effervescent
much
like
champagne
taste
is
very
complex
and
delicious
a
great
belgianstyle
brew
from
the
midwest
ok
ba
has
this
labeled
as
a
tripel
im
not
sure
i
would
agree
that
this
is
the
style
thats
probably
why
it
doesnt
score
better
than
it
did
on
the
site
bright
gold
color
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
a
thick
foamy
lace
drapes
down
the
side
of
the
glass
with
every
sip
bright
fruity
aroma
almost
a
citrus
grapefruit
character
this
carries
over
to
the
taste
along
with
almost
a
champagne
astringency
very
bright
almost
tart
the
champagne
character
in
the
flavor
becomes
more
evident
later
in
the
beer
it
has
a
rich
almost
velvety
mouth
feel
in
front
with
the
astringency
on
the
back
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
warm
weather
beer
it
would
also
be
a
good
beer
to
use
to
convert
a
wine
drinker
almost
onedimensional
in
its
sweetness
though
id
love
to
see
how
it
develops
my
first
triple
so
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
it
looks
very
attractive
and
has
some
nice
characteristics
that
make
it
a
nice
winter
alternative
to
my
regular
stouts
ill
check
it
out
again
as
it
has
a
limited
availability
another
nice
offering
from
kalamazoo
brewing
mouthfeel
nothing
to
say
really
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
either
there
isnt
a
ton
of
carbonation
which
i
was
expecting
from
a
sparkling
ale
and
it
isnt
particularly
full
like
a
champagne
or
anything
like
that
pretty
dead
on
average
as
was
the
drinkability
i
am
drinking
the
brew
at
room
temp
in
a
tulipchalice
the
brew
pours
a
very
nice
bright
orangish
gold
color
that
is
slightly
hazy
with
some
yeast
sediment
there
are
numerous
rising
bubble
streams
floating
towards
the
surface
a
bleached
white
fluffy
head
foams
up
3
cm
easily
and
releases
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
i
get
some
floral
hops
mixing
with
orange
citrusy
scents
and
a
bit
of
apricot
and
white
grape
the
first
sip
reveals
very
light
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
the
flavor
is
mild
up
front
and
is
light
and
fruity
just
like
the
nose
i
find
orange
and
apricot
mixing
with
some
banana
yeast
charabters
and
a
bit
of
biscuitiness
the
beer
is
smooth
and
lite
very
easy
to
drink
reminisicient
of
champagne
just
like
the
bottle
states
many
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
beer
this
one
hit
the
spot
really
good
easy
to
handle
and
well
contructed
bottle
is
soon
diminished
leaving
my
glass
with
a
bit
more
color
than
it
started
with
thanks
go
out
to
feloniousmonk
for
providing
me
a
bottle
of
this
fine
bells
offering
poured
cloudy
golden
with
a
medium
size
head
with
a
lot
of
floaties
aroma
citrus
malty
alcoholyeasts
flavor
sour
grapefruit
yeast
as
the
description
says
tart
alcolol
burn
fruity
not
to
bad
bells
does
it
again
i
am
glad
that
bells
is
so
easy
to
get
golden
sunny
day
body
head
is
limited
to
a
thin
film
from
the
beginning
very
floral
aroma
grassy
with
notes
of
honey
lemon
grapefruit
youd
almost
think
this
is
a
well
hopped
pilsner
and
youd
be
right
werent
it
for
the
very
yeasty
counterpart
saazy
taste
floral
and
orangey
creamy
lemonbite
slight
mineral
tones
foamy
mouthfeel
with
fitting
effervescence
the
comfortable
texture
and
nice
fruityeast
development
make
it
pretty
good
and
theres
certainly
a
good
amount
of
balancing
hops
together
with
a
slight
tart
presence
but
dont
expect
anything
spectacular
thanks
jeff
i
drank
the
yeasty
sediment
separately
and
liked
the
taste
much
better
it
was
spicier
and
less
flowery
ill
try
rolling
the
next
one
before
opening
but
im
sure
it
will
adversely
effect
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
this
seems
like
an
odd
duck
tripel
to
me
not
based
on
the
belgainstyle
malts
that
i
usually
associate
with
the
style
but
variety
is
the
spice
of
life
i
guess
and
this
one
was
an
enjoyable
brew
experimentation
is
always
welcome
not
always
appreciated
but
always
welcome
beer
is
good
happy
beering
tripels
arent
my
favorite
style
but
i
must
admit
that
theyre
growing
on
me
i
would
put
this
one
at
the
top
of
my
list
along
with
great
lakes
anniversary
ale
id
have
to
have
them
side
by
side
to
pick
an
absolute
favorite
but
both
are
excellent
domestic
versions
bells
sparkling
ale
is
a
fine
beer
and
i
recommend
it
heartily
to
those
who
have
even
a
passing
interest
in
the
style

thanks
to
feloniousmonk

sending
this
beauty
shop
out
my
way
after
browsing
this
beer
several
times
i
always
passed
it
by
based
on
the
label
sparkling
ale
only
after
reading
the
fine
print
did
i
see
that
it
was
a
belgian
pours
a
lightly
cloudy
dark
golden
color
with
a
medium
thin

thin

the
aroma
is
a

with
a
strong

character
and
flavors
of

citrus
and

some
alcohol
is
evident
at
times
too
the
finish
is
rather
short
and
leaves
a
lingering
yeast
taste
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
doesnt
compete
with
the
better
belgians
out
there
especially
considering
the
price

this
is
the

i

i
like

i
feel

must

bas
who
sent
me
this
one
feloniousmonk
mjr
wvbeergeek
it
was
worth
the
wait
as
perhaps
it
improves
with
age
ok
what
a
relief
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
just
what
the
hell
was
going
on
with
this
one
i
was
expecting
a
lighter
refreshing
summer
type
ale
and
what
i
got
wasnt
fitting
into
my
expectations
my
bottle
was
very
fresh
as
the
yeast
poured
in
as
a
cloud
instead
of
chunks
very
cloudy
medium
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
pineapple
and
banana
and
a
good
bit
of
spice
in
the
arome
lightly
sweet
malt
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
the
aroma
but
still
tasty
the
name
is
appropriate
given
the
plentiful
and
constant
streams
of
tiny
bubbles
served
from
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
my
glass
a
light
golden
color
somewhat
hazy
and
whitecapped
with
a
fine
thick
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
some
time
aromas
of
yeast
and
bread
rising
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
alcohol
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
absolutely
delicious
complex
and
very
drinkable
for
a
tripel
even
an
american
tripel
as
bells
calls
it
starts
out
sweet
and
breadymalty
at
first
then
roils
into
a
complex
blend
of
hop
bitterness
tangly
spice
and
hints
of
orchard
peach
and
lemon
finish
is
nicely
dry
and
just
a
bit
sour
with
a
nice
hint
of
warmth
very
drinkable
stuff
wish
i
had
more
than
this
one
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
noticeable
flakes
of
sediment
floating
throughout
the
beer
nose
is
quite
sweet
with
aromas
of
candied
sugar
fruity
yeasts
and
a
bit
of
belgian
spice
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
that
is
a
bit
zesty
and
spritzy
in
nature
as
with
the
aroma
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
with
flavors
of
cane
sugar
and
apricots
followed
by
some
citrus
fruit
and
sweet
malt
next
comes
a
good
deal
of
spiciness
with
notes
of
coriander
clove
white
pepper
and
some
vanilla
extract
towards
the
end
to
me
this
was
sort
of
like
duvel
with
a
good
dose
of
extra
sugar
addedpretty
darn
tasty
thanks
to
faernt
for
the
sample
foggy
orange
in
color
with
a
brief
white
dome
of
creamy
suds
the
aromas
are
an
enticing
blend
of
toast
butter
and
orange
marmalade
on
the
palate
it
is
pleasantly
bitter
from
beginning
to
end
and
drenched
with
flavors
of
peach
skins
root
vegetables
orange
peel
and
noble
tannins
cutting
edge
bitterly
hopped
belgianstyle
triple
and
one
of
the
best
bells
beers
of
any
style
while
this
one
was
interesting
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
many
of
them
this
was
a
little
bit
sweeter
than
i
like
a
tripel
as
well
still
a
solid
offering
from
a
solid
brewerey
drinkability
good
for
a
tripel
id
have
another
i
just
may
as
the
bottom
of
this
one
is
pretty
clumped
up
with
junk
and
i
think
my
other
one
wont
last
very
good
overall
i
definitely
reccomend
it
i
came
to
this
beer
after
an
expedition
stout
and
its
the
difference
between
night
and
day
well
almost
their
nearly
as
strong
this
poured
a
pale
hazy
dull
gold
color
and
was
topped
off
with
a
white
cream
like
head
of
foam
nice
light
and
spicy
aroma
of
grainy
fruits
good
blend
of
dry
spiciness
and
sweet
malts
yeasty
with
an
assertive
sour
tang
in
the
finish
i
love
the
spiciness
in
this
beer

it
blends
together
perfectly
with
the
dryness
that
the
alcohol
creates
lemony
and
peppery
this
is
a
refreshing
trippel
strong
and
sweet
sour
citric
and
dry

all
at
once
ive
had
better
examples
but
this
is
very
nice

but
lingering
bitterness
that
is
not
really
pleasant
as
you
finish
your
sip
seems
weird
ive
never
tasted
this
before
sort
of
brings
the
beer
down
a
notch
still
enjoyable
once
you
get
past
it
could
pass
for
duvel
if
things
didnt
get
funky
at
the
end
regardless
a
solid
american
tripel
thanks
feloniousmonk
this
is
honestly
amongst
the
best
tripels
ive
ever
had
a
nice
floral
sweetness
with
only
a
slight
yeasty
character
makes
this
a
great
beer
and
one
ill
hope
to
have
again
in
the
future
complex
but
a
bit
too
much
hoppy
bitterness
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
and
this
styriansort
of
wallop
further
underscores
the
bready
and
yeasty
tones
a
bit
too
much
in
the
lingering
finish
wow
thanks
to
bighuge
for
this
tripeltastic
beer

recommended
appearance
mesmorizing
glowing
golden
orange
amber
hue
with
a
fluffy
growing
massive
white
head
leaves
thick
patches
of
lacing
so
good
evenly
dispersed
aroma
herbal
clove
combo
with
the
funky
yeast
characteristic
that
every
bells
brew
has
a
warming
sweetness
but
no
acohol
ridden
nose
taste
excellent
ties
everything
together
so
well
seems
farmhouse
funkyness
of
peppery
spices
and
then
the
bread
yeast
characteristics
with
an
herbal
clove
and
underlying
fruit
sensation
this
is
good
stuff
mouthfeel
fluffy
very
right
on
the
mark
for
carbonation
spritzy
but
still
holds
together
some
great
texture
awesome
drinkability
dangerous
i
could
chill
with
these
all
day
but
a
bigger
beer
means
beware
so
good
clean
well
made
triple
awesome
one
of
the
better
american
brewed
versions
a
quite
outstanding
brew
was
not
expecting
a
belgian
style
ale
but
was
happily
surprised
to
find
one
in
the
bottle
the
aroma
of
candi
sugar
and
tropical
fruit
was
a
wonder
to
behold
the
flavor
was
nicely
balanced
between
sweet
chewy
malt
and
acidic
grapefruit
flavors
an
obscenely
well
crafted
brew
and
a
pure
joy
to
drink
could
easily
make
this
a
session
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
high
alcohol
as
it
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
i
bought
this
brew
for
new
years
not
really
knowing
it
was
a
abbey
tripel
or
what
to
expect
as
soon
as
i
opened
it
bubbles
formed
in
the
bottle
neck
on
a
careful
pour
i
got
an
inch
of
liquid
brew
and
one
massive
head
i
let
it
sit
as
the
hazy
amber
gold
settled
back
to
liquid
from
the
bottom
up
the
head
was
white
fluffy
lace
sticks
around
all
glass
long
the
aroma
of
flower
hop
and
citrus
the
taste
was
lemonlime
citrus
hop
slight
malt
backed
by
a
soft
but
noticed
hint
of
alcohol
the
mouth
is
left
tart
i
should
of
bought
more
for
the
cellar
i
agree
the
sweetness
of
this
2003
had
not
developed
yet
but
a
good
brew
of
bubbly
to
be
had
happy
new
year
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
frown
a
drinking
too
many
given
the
high
alcohol
content
thanks

a
pythonic
sized

finish

rigorous

its
acidity
and
the
hop
titillating
in
their
spiciness
quite
dry
and
somewhat
tart

a
quite
tasty
brew
this
beer
makes
reserving
examples
of
annual
bottlings
worthwhile
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
beer
the
aroma
was
very
nice
quite
spicy
with
orange
coriander
and
clove
along
the
lines
of
a
spicedup
witbier
not
a
lot
the
aroma
translated
into
the
flavor
up
front
a
quick
hit
of
some
yeast
fruit
and
then
the
flavor
washed
out
the
middle
was
rather
flavorless
and
the
finish
was
a
nondescript
bitterness
the
label
noted
that
it
was
an
american
tripel
i
guess
this
is
like
the
american
wheat
interpretations
bland
and
without
soul
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
picked
this
beer
up
but
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
large
head
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
lots
of
floaty
stuff
the
aroma
is
mostly
citrus
and
yeast
not
too
strong
the
flavor
is
big
be
prepared
the
citrus
and
the
yeast
pack
a
strong
punch
when
you
taste
it
there
are
also
some
spices
in
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
very
evident
in
the
taste
but
blends
pretty
well
the
drinkability
isnt
as
high
as
i
would
like
but
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
once
you
get
used
to
it

unique

makes
for

smoothes
out
even
more
as
it
warms
a
fine
triple
style
but
surprisingly
mild
for
bells
have
also
had
it
on
draft
before
and
it
was
even
better
a
beautiful
pour
here
orangish
gold
and
cloudy

appearance
large

that
was
sticky
and
foamy
intense
amounts
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
with
a
good
amount
of
yeast
floating
around
i
could
look
at
this
all
day
long
i
couldnt
get
too
much
from
the
nose
of
this
beer
kind
of
champagne
in
smell
but
the
taste
hit
you
like
a
bag
of
bricks
a
sweet
precense
hit
my
tongue
first
followed
immediately
by
a
citrusy
and
tarty
fruit
taste
hoppiness
is
at
the
end
but
not
really
that
noticeable
strong
flavors
of
yeast
and
peppery
spices
finish
up
this
complex
and
well
made
brew
from
kalamazoo
i
must
get
this
one
again
a
really
lovely
brew
from
the
folks
at
bells
this
beer
could
be
called
son
of
bells
third
coast
old
ale
it
has
a
syrupy
sticky
mouthfeel
and
a
bubbly
carbonated
character
the
alcohol
is
apparent
but
the
overall
flavor
of
the
beer
is
strong
enough
not
to
let
the
alcohol
dominate
not
what
i
would
call
a
session
beer
because
it
is
heavy
in
flavor
and
alcohol
content
but
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
just
one
highly
carbonated
large
yeast
chunks
very
pale
orange
offwhite
head
lasts
a
minute
or
so
smells
like
a
creamsicle
with
big
yeast
esters
and
phenolics
tastes
smooth
and
well
balanced
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
finishes
with
a
long
lingering
spiciness
reminds
me
a
bit
of
heavyweight
lunacy
except
this
has
the
phenolics
in
more
control
very
creamy
texture
by
the
end
of
the
beer
it
was
as
much
from
white
labs
as
it
was
from
bells
it
pours
a
crisp
golden
yellow
with
a
lot
of
suspended
sediment
making
it
sort
of
hazy
tiny
bubbles
champagnelike
it
has
a
yeasty
wheatlike
aroma
you
cant
really
smell
the
alcohol
but
its
there
believe
me
sweet
and
smooth
nice
job
again
from
the
people
at
bells
hazy
gold
color
medium
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
yeasty
a
medium
bodied
belgian
ale
very
typical
of
a
belgian
ale
fruity
and
sweet
yeasty
and
spicy
flavors
are
peachy
apricots
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
sparkling
is
a
good
description
this
is
a
very
dangerous
beer
as
there
is
no
hint
of
its
10

alcohol
content
very
smooth
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
sticky
sweetness
left
on
my
lips

i
like
this
beer
but
there
are
higher
rated
tripels
cloudy
amber
with
a
thick
nearly
white
head
capping
it
this
beer
looks
the
part
and
laces
very
well
aroma
was
a
bit
weak
and
really
suggested
a
bit
more
hop
than
i
expected
the
taste
was
a
real
dissapointment
for
me
i
felt
that
the
hops
overpowered
all
the
other
flavors
i
love
in
a
belgian
the
finish
was
a
bit
bitter
and
the
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
if
it
tasted
better
it
would
quickly
put
you
on
your
ass
before
you
had
any
idea
what
was
coming
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
like
in
a
trippel
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
as
i
poured
this
ale
into
my
glass
it
was
a
mere
coincidence
that
it
resembled
the
liquid
that
previously
rested
in
the
very
same
glass
allagash
white
appearance
was
amazingly
similar
cloudy
honey
colored
with
a
towering
white
fluffy
head
yielding
great
retention
aroma
was
quite
accurate
to
a
good
belgien
wit
sweet
and
an
almost
yeasty
wheat
aroma
and
slightly
sour
body
is
very
smooth
and
full
with
a
slight
crispness
but
not
as
sparkling
as
i
expected
alcohol
of
10
is
disguised
beautifully
this
is
a
fantastic
ale
and
as
good
as
most
belgiens
ive
had
this
brew
pours
a
very
envigorated
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
off
white
bubbles
and
a
carbonated
yeasty
cloudy
golden
colored
body
with
a
lot
of
yeast
floating
in
it
its
aroma
is
very
mild
and
almost
nonexistant
it
had
very
little
lacing
this
brew
is
very
belgian
like
with
a
flavor
of
yeast
bread
flowertry
and
citrousy
its
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fizzy
iverall
it
is
a
very
nice
brew
an
americanbelgian
ale
for
indeed
when
this
brew
was
poured
it
had
a
white
creamy
head
that
consisted
of
finesmall
bubbles
the
body
was
golden
in
color
and
there
was
a
lot
of
carbonation
present
i
wasnt
sure
what
name
to
give
the
aroma
as
it
was
hard
to
figure
out
in
my
opinion
the
lacing
was
very
good
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
there
was
also
some
yeast
observed
with
this
brew
the
first
taste
of
this
brew
seemed
to
leave
a
tingling
sensation
in
the
back
of
my
throat
this
was
not
a
bad
drink
in
my
opinion
f
originally
sampled
on
2
november
2002
cloudy
golden
belgianstyle
ale
incredibly
drinkable
considering
the
10
25abv
nice
aroma
of
apricots
great
flavor
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
was
expecting
a
nice
simple
beer
and
wound
up
w
a
top
notch
belgian
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
lest
you
must
drive
your
drunken
ass
home
i
would
need
to
space
them
out
though
give
my
palate
a
break
and
whatnot
deep
golden
hue
with
a
light
murk
thick
virtually
solid
stiff
porcelain
white
head
retains
well
and
leaves
roughly
textured
lace
soft
but
bright
juicy
acidic
fruit
akin
to
ripe
kiwi
and
starfruit
are
dominant
aromawise
alcohol
provides
a
heaty
undertone
and
subdued
clove
phenol
adds
a
sweetly
herbal
tinge
clean
well
rounded
in
aroma
citrus
laced
sweetness
upfront
in
flavor
is
quickly
supplemented
by
a
mellow
clove
and
lingering
bready
malt
combination
breadiness
morphs
into
a
oddly
thick
pseudosweet
jackfruit
and
starch
melange
akin
to
breadfruit
mid
palate
ethanol
and
fusels
are
well
integrated
and
provide
a
subtle
heat
lending
a
heated
tropical
compote
impression
late
moderate
bodied
with
a
firm
yet
smoothly
dextrinous
mouthfeel
finishes
mostly
clean
with
a
snap
of
hop
bitterness
and
peppery
alcohol
yielding
to
lingering
mellow
sweetness
a
flavorful
highly
drinkable
tripel
not
as
complex
in
yeast
derived
flavor
contributions
as
others
and
certainly
more
dextrinous
perhaps
fermented
too
low
and
a
touch
under
attenuated
as
well
nevertheless
a
dangerously
balanced
brew
very
tasty
kudos
to
feloniousmonk
for
delivering
the
bottle
of
another
fine
bells
pours
to
a
goldenstraw
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
leaves
good
lacing
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
it
has
a
soft
medicinal
aroma
with
sweet
candi
sugar
a
tad
bit
of
clove
and
haylike
aromas
are
present
it
is
a
very
unique
aroma
the
flavor
is
medicinal
and
sweet
with
an
alcohol
flavor
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
brew
with
a
dry
finish
it
has
a
masked
alcoholic
kick
that
will
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
a
tasty
brew
thanks
feloniousmonk
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
white
head
an
excellent
ale
malty
yeasty
spicy
and
warming
this
is
a
really
good
representation
of
a
triple
yet
from
michigan
a
very
enjoyable
beer
its
cool
to
see
brewers
take
on
complex
styles
like
this
bells
sparkling
ale
what
a
tremendous
head
three
inches
of
solid
white
foam
that
lasts
and
lasts
it
will
take
several
minutes
before
the
head
dissipates
and
i
can
try
my
first
sip
a
deep
golden
yellow
the
beer
is
very
hazy
with
suspended
particulates
the
aroma
is
very
nice
and
appealing
oranges
and
just
a
touch
of
parsley
the
initial
sip
shows
off
the
high
carbonation
levels
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
very
fruity
with
oranges
and
a
hint
of
bananas
there
is
a
hint
of
sourness
toward
the
end
that
is
not
only
not
unpleasant
but
really
helps
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
the
fruits
boy
for
a
beer
with
something
north
of
10
percent
alcohol
it
is
not
that
noticeable
except
for
a
little
warmth
deep
in
the
throat
very
nice
initially
i
could
have
been
fooled
that
i
was
drinking
a
duvel
the
appearance
with
that
lemonmeringue
head
that
somewhat
sour
taste
etc
but
as
you
go
on
you
notice
the
difference
there
is
something
in
the
aftertaste
that
doesnt
sit
as
well
whereas
with
a
duvel
i
crave
another
i
dont
think
id
drink
more
than
one
it
doesnt
seem
to
hit
at
10
25
either
i
wont
go
into
any
more
detail
but
this
is
similar
to
several
great
belgian
beers
and
it
doesnt
miss
by
too
much
im
sure
if
any
of
the
homebrewers
on
the
site
tried
to
make
a
duvel
and
came
up
with
this
theyd
be
thrilled
im
sampling
several
bells
beers
thanks
monk
and
so
far
im
impressed
i
am
floored
reminding
me
of
a
cross
between
la
fin
du
monde
celis
grand
cru
and
great
lakes
anniversary
ale
this
is
one
of
the
most
exceptional
brews
ive
ever
had
comparable
to
the
worlds
best
grand
crus
if
you
love
unibroues
10
or
11
this
is
a
musttry
this
beer
is
pure
punchdrunk
love
im
giggling
and
a
shiteating
smile
erupts
across
my
face
im
in
love
its
a
little
bit
orange
and
pale
yellow
with
some
cloudiness
and
sediment
floating
a
gargantuan
fluffy
head
forms
and
stays
throughout
the
aroma
is
very
citrusy
mostly
lemons
and
grapefruit
flavors
consist
of
citrus
strongly
as
well
some
spiciness
and
some
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
its
rather
smooth
for
such
a
high
abv
im
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
its
most
definitely
worth
a
try
anything
with
the
name
bells
has
impressed
me
thus
far
this
beer
surprised
me
it
poured
out
to
a
bright
color
almost
orange
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
that
of
light
hops
the
taste
though
is
where
this
shines
through
somewhat
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
bells
beer
hops
are
here
but
arent
an
overwhelming
presence
and
balance
quite
nicely
with
the
malt
the
10
25
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
isnt
noticeable
in
the
middle
more
fruitiness
comes
through
peach
apricot
but
sugar
is
still
strong
light
in
body
and
texture
but
full
of
flavor
and
bursting
with
playful
hops
sparkling
is
the
appropriate
name
for
this
ale
and
bells
has
crafted
the
best
duvel
imitation
ive
ever
tasted
from
belgium
the
u
s
or
anywhere
else
in
the
universe
in
the
glass
it
looks
like
a
lemon
meringue
pie
smells
like
one
too
huge
frothy
bright
white
head
hazy
yellow
effervescent
liquid
very
mild
flavor
tart
and
slightly
sour
and
very
lemonlike
most
refreshing
and
much
more
suitable
for
a
hot
summer
day
enjoyable
nonetheless
on
this
cold
january
evening
ill
remember
this
brew
come
august
im
impressed
with
this
brewerys
range
ive
always
thought
of
them
as
stout
makers
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
thin
but
persistent
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
a
nice
musty
aroma
of
orange
peel
coriander
and
malt
somewhat
sweet
and
doughy
the
aroma
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
duvel
flavor
is
musty
as
well
with
yeast
toasted
malt
coriander
and
slightly
sweet
citrus
notes
very
good
full
body
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
pale
and
is
quite
unique
highly
drinkable
and
deceptively
strong
i
couldnt
believe
that
its
actually
10
25
abv
a
definate
must
try
if
you
like
belgian
beers
this
ale
appears
to
be
a
true
belgian
at
first
deep
golden
color
with
a
well
retaining
head
and
excellent
lacing
qualities
the
nose
however
keeps
it
from
being
so
aroma
is
of
yeast
apple
and
dried
peas
not
too
attractive
taste
is
similar
with
that
pea
note
making
itself
known
more
than
any
spices
hops
yeast
whatever
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
but
not
as
prickly
as
i
prefer
from
a
belgian
pale
strong
ale
drinkability
is
fairly
strong
for
a
beer
of
its
size
but
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
bottle
this
is
one
of
bells
weaker
efforts
but
i
applaud
the
effort
overall
for
a
brewery
that
specializes
in
stouts
and
the
like
this
isnt
too
bad
for
what
its
worth
confused
unique
and
interesting
ill
see
how
my
other
bottle
of
this
responds
to
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
hazy
glowing
goldenorange
color
huge
off
white
foamy
head
fruity
citrusy
sweet
aroma
sweet
champagnewine
like
fruity
flavor
full
body
loaded
carbonation
like
seltzer
or
champagne
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
hazy
bright
peach
color
with
lots
of
chunks
and
a
14
inch
head
that
laces
in
rings
some
yeastiness
and
definite
bread
in
the
aroma
with
a
little
sour
apple
viscous
mouthfeel
prickly
sense
of
coriander
and
thistle
flowers
candied
lemon
and
a
musty
sense
of
canvas
finishes
with
impressive
hops
and
a
big
and
bitter
alcohol
bite
something
about
this
was
unsettling
in
my
mouth
and
stomach
some
sense
of
a
bitter
anisey
medicine
and
thick
flavor
warbling
thats
not
my
style
the
yeasty
smells
are
distinctly
bells
and
seem
more
appropriate
in
their
stouts
oh
well
you
cant
love
em
all
okay
this
beer
is
bells
attempt
at
a
belgian
in
the
sea
of
its
november
stouts
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
sedimentparticles
present
it
formed
a
nice
white
bubbly
head
that
subsided
leaving
circular
lace
an
faint
aroma
of
malt
and
spice
a
flavor
of
malt
hops
and
grain
with
some
spice
element
the
finish
reminded
me
a
touch
of
an
ipa
pale
golden
orange
mildly
hazy
small
lacy
head
sweet
sour
spicy
aroma
fruity
and
yeasty
taste
starts
sweet
but
then
the
confusion
begins
a
sourness
rolls
past
the
tastebuds
is
it
an
attempt
at
a
lambic
nah
coriander
next
a
strong
wit
stupid
idea
dries
a
littte
but
stays
sweet
finishes
astringently
bitter
i
like
this
beer
but
have
no
idea
what
im
drinking
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
body
topped
by
a
full
frothy
white
head
that
eventually
receeds
to
an
18
creamy
surface
covering
the
thin
head
holds
exceptionally
well
buoyed
by
carbonation
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
fruity
yeasty
and
sweet
with
cookie
dough
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
very
fine
and
lightly
effervescent
carbonation
that
leaves
it
quite
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
starts
lightly
tangy
and
fruity
citrus
then
becomes
quite
creamy
in
the
mouth
as
it
warms
co2
breaks
out
of
solution
enhancing
the
sweet
bready
malt
alcohol
peppery
notes
and
a
firm
bitterness
burst
forth
then
gently
receed
with
a
lingering
sweet
fruity
cherries
berries
orange
maltiness
in
an
exceptionally
long
finish
quite
impressive
clearly
a
little
bit
on
the
wild
side
but
also
unique
clearly
not
a
pale
ale
definitely
a
tripel
cheers
to
deuce
for
the
sample
looks
great
and
smells
very
nice
but
tastewise
this
it
has
a
strong
sour
grain
alcohol
presence
i
guess
at
10
you
might
get
that
but
i
would
never
buy
this
one
again
really
a
sour
finish
im
not
a
big
belgian
fan
to
start
with
and
this
one
really
doesnt
sit
right
for
my
personal
preferences
bells
does
much
better
than
this
no
longer
my
favorite
beer
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
of
style
in
my
book
a
very
good
tripel
its
a
bit
candy
sweet
and
fruity
but
it
goes
down
oh
so
smooth
with
just
enough
drying
herbal
hop
profile
in
the
finish
its
big
time
drinkable
and
a
great
beer
pours
a
white
frothy
head
cloudy
pale
appearance
fresh
hop
aroma
maybe
candi
sugar
aroma
the
aroma
reminds
me
a
bit
of
some
of
the
better
belgian
beers
that
ive
had
like
de
dolle
stille
nacht
very
slight
alcohol
taste
not
as
much
as
youd
expect
from
a
10
beer
there
is
a
sour
taste
present
similar
to
belgian
beers
also
theres
a
hoppy
taste
but
this
beer
is
not
bitter
like
an
ipa
pretty
easy
drinking
for
10
alcohol
kalamazoo
website
describes
this
beer
as
a
tripple
pale
ale
lighter
than
typical
trippel
with
distinct
clove
on
the
palate
citrus
on
the
nose
ill
give
this
a
b
mouthfeel
is
light
but
still
rich
the
alcohol
provides
some
burn
which
is
unusual
in
a
good
tripel
despite
the
alcohol
burn
this
is
still
a
very
drinkable
tripel
i
far
exceeded
my
halftime
quota
for
the
first
football
playoff
game
today
this
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
a
top
notch
tripel
too
hoppy
for
a
tripel
solid
beer
for
the
style
would
definitely
stock
up
on
this
beauty
if
i
could
find
it
doesnt
have
wide
distribution
taste
of
peaches
and
belgian

i
really
liked
this
one
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
complexity
the
sweetness
is
not
overdone
and
balanced
nicely
by
the
spice
this
is
easily
the
best
triple
i
have
tried
in
some
time
this
is
the
first
beer
from
this
brewery
i
have
tried
i
am
anxious
to
try
more
and
at
8
for
a
750ml
a
really
great
bargain
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
pour
is
lightly
hazed
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
nose
is
similar
to
the
blonde
has
the
some
dusty
malt
spice
isnt
as
assertive
nor
is
the
perfume
in
a
good
way
taste
is
sweeter
than
the
nose
faint
dusty
malt
with
lemon
and
a
bit
of
candied
sugar
light
citrus
in
the
back
soft
body
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
o
excellent
tripel
emphasizing
fruity
and
peppery
flavors
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
triple
that
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
very
inoffensive
and
rather
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
in
light
of
its
8
5
abv
nothing
overly
exceptional
but
still
rather
enjoyable
a
very
neutral
belgian
triple
easy
drinking
triple
with
a
deceptive
alcohol
level
it
is
a
lot
stronger
than
it
tastes
o
wonderful
tripel
that
is
a
delight
from
start
to
finish
from
bottle
not
the
usual
belgium
triple
none
of
the
ubiquitous
traits
no
bread
yeast
head
flavor
or
nose
a
very
broad
palate
with
lots
going
on
sweetish
lots
of
caramelraisin
like
flavor
all
adds
up
to
a
pleasant
cover
for
the
8
5
abv
o
great
beer
i
suggest
drinking
this
in
late
fall
and
winter
excellent
tripel
full
of
a
great
fruity
complexity
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
despite
its
8
5
abv
very
balanced
and
pleasant
hard
to
beat
this
fruity
profile
not
sure
if
i
was
lucky
any
way
i
will
remember
this
had
8
months
to
maturity
o
great
beer
dangerously
sessionable
and
very
smooth
upfront
biscuit
malts
in
the
taste
but
also
a
rather
offputting
musky
cellarlike
quality
that
cannot
be
properly
defined
i
didnt
dislike
it
but
there
are
better
abbey
tripels
out
there
overall
a
very
nice
tripple
ale
not
alcoholic
notes
and
very
well
balanced
to
repeat
without
doubt
blond
cloudy
with
little
foam
that
disappears
quickly
smells
a
lot
like
european
hops
quite
carbonated
and
i
think
citrus
strong
taste
of
hops
but
still
balanced
the
alcohol
is
not
too
overwhelming
in
the
mouth
plain
beer
with
few
interesting
notes
not
bad
but
i
expected
a
lot
more
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
tripel
not
too
sweet
which
can
happen
with
some
beers
of
the
style
really
good
overall
and
excellent
triple
the
malt
throws
me
for
a
bit
of
a
loop
with
the
banana
and
fruit
esters
the
malt
confuses
me
and
it
kind
of
makes
it
a
bit
hard
to
read
but
otherwise
this
is
a
really
fine
triple
i
actually
enjoy
this
more
than
i
remember
enjoying
the
saison
definitely
worth
at
least
a
try
the
only
thing
bad
that
can
come
out
of
this
is
becoming
a
bit
addicted
to
it
which
all
in
all
isnt
that
bad
pairs
well
with
fish
tacos
and
mango
salsa
with
chips
and
guacamole
it
also
goes
well
with
sharp
cheddar
cheese
and
black
grapes
poured
into
a
st
feuillien
goblet
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
fine
one
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
interesting
aroma
of
stone
fruit
and
orange
juice
light
bready
yeast
spicy
with
an
odd
agave
component
one
of
the
more
intriguing

experienced
flavor
follows
with
apricot
orange
lime
and
apple
juice
light
bready
yeast
and
hints
of
coriander
and
clove
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
a
very
fruit
forward
tripel
with
nice
balance
not
as
intense
as
some
other
belgian
tripels
but
a
nice
complex
fruit
body
that
is
quite
enjoyable
finish
has
tripel
spicing
and
light
hops
but
pleasant
residual
stone
fruit
flavors
as
well
oddly
the
flavor
seems
to
become
more
bland
as
glass
sits
and
warms
however
i
will
return
to
this
tripel
again
o
a
nice
tripel
sweet
bottle
is
awesome
like
a
rennaisance
painting
having
this
one
leading
up
to
my
bday
celebration
after
waiting
6
months
to
purchase
it
pretty
solid
belgian
trippel
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
but
i
have
had
a
few
trippels
that
are
much
better
than
this
the
flavor
is
great
but
compared
to
the
chimay
white
or
westmalles
trip
it
falls
just
barely
short
still
an
otherwise
awesome
beer
overall
simply
a
very
strange
tripel
that
i
mostly
enjoyed
despite
my
inability
to
describe
it
ill
admit
ive
been
to
this
brewery
and
pretty
much
love
the
whole
lineup
the
beers
have
a
great
balance
and
the
yeast
is
wonderful
in
that
theres
really
no
offensive
esters
similar
to
st
bernardus
valdieu
and
allagash
perhaps
not
the
most
amazing
tripel
ive
had
but
its
quite
good
overall
i
wish
i
could
remember
how
much
i
bought
this
little
gem
for
regardless
i
want
to
grab
it
again
it
is
very
rich
and
robust
and
have
to
replenish
as
soon
as
i
get
a
chance
salud
overall
fairly
good
a
beer
i
pine
for
ondraft
and
ive
had
it
that
way
and
it
can
be
quite
addicting
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
see
it
if
excellent
belgian
ales
tickle
your
fancy
this
is
a
boner
in
a
bottle
overall
a
very
good
quality
tripel
and
i
like
tripels
to
start
with
a
great
combination
of
flavours
that
resolve
beautifully
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
tripel
but
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
o
excellent
example
of
the
belgian
triple
well
worth
the
purchase
food
match
read
the
blonde
review
for
main
courses
otherwise
desserts
like
käsekuchen
or
sachertorte
would
work
well
with
this
brew

from

to

so
st
feuillien
may
have
just
moved
up
the
list
for
this
summers
trip
to
belgium
carbonation
is
perhaps
a
little
overenthusiastic
o
a
good
tripel
overall
id
like
a
bit
more
depth
of
flavor
and
aroma
but
its
still
very
nicely
done
and
drinkable
cheers
overall
sorry
but
this
one
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
and
i
usually
always
enjoy
the
tripel
style
if
you
see
this
one
on
the
shelves
i
would
suggest
passing
it
over
for
la
fin

or
westmalle
tripel
overall
this
is
a
solid
belgian
triple
ale
light
enough
to
have
more
than
one
but
enough
abv
to
sip
and
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
cheers
overall
a
good
solid
triple
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
tripel
there
is
nothing
that
really
stands
out
but
also
nothing
to
detract
its
good
all

a
great
beer
o
as
i
said
one
of
the
best
i
dont
dislike
this
one
either
this
brewer
seems
to
not
screw
up
the
styles
or
make
them
overly
boring
but
they
seems
to
miss
things
best

what
is
even
stranger
than
this
brewerys
products
are
usually
excellent
compromise
is
detected
here
and
there
a
friendly
and
hops
on
one
side
lemon
vitamin
c
probably
but
it
is
unfortunately
too
little
digestible
for
a
standard
this
beer
is
all
about
the
yeast
from
start
to
finish
you
get
the
spicy
musty
notes
produced
by
their
unique
yeast
i
enjoyed
it
because
it
was
kept
light
and
the
carbonation
produced
small
bubbles
that
balanced
the
beer
well
even
the
mouth
feel
which
ties
this
all
together
is
very
apparently
a
product
of
this
yeast
strain
id
be
very
interested
to
try
another
st
feuillien
product
to
sample
their
yeast
in
another
light
o
this
is
a
solid
tripel
that
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
certainly
recommended
so
far
this
beer
is
my
favorite
belgian
tripel
i
have
yet
to
have
anything
made
by
brasserie
st
feullien
that
i
havent
liked
i
hope
to
someday
visit
them
on
a
trip
to
belgium
if
you
havent
had
this
beer
i
strongly
recommend
it
overall
a
different
triple
that
is
for
sure
the
flavors
in
here
are
unique
not
the
best
ive
had
but
wouldnt
turn
down
one
if
offered
lots
of
carbonation
on
this
beer
it
is
a
little
bit
too
active
for
me
some
more
smoothness
would
compliment
the
tealike
flavors
here
this
is
one
of
those
bodies
that
gets
thicker
on
the
swallow
than
it
was
in
your
mouth
so
less
carbonation
would
help
to
smooth
out
that
element
still
it
is
a
tickytack
level
of
carbonation
that
im
talking
about
the
mouthfeel
still
feels
quite
satisfying
some
good
dryness
to
the
beer
too
which
works
well
with
the
flavors
overall
this
is
a
lovely
tripel
its
different
but
entirely
cohesive
malty
sweetness
first
hits
the
tongue
followed
by
mild
hops
and
biscuit
flavors
well
rounded
and
smooth
the
high
gravity
is
not
overt
but
the
alcohol
esters
are
noticeable
a
very
slightly
bitter
finish
enveloped
by
sweetness
makes
this
is
a
most
pleasant
tripel
to
digest

top
of

notch
overall
a
wonderful
mild
flavored
and
very
belgian
beer
similar
to
st
bernardus
in
profile
the
gushing
was
a
little
annoying
but
not
catastrophic
a
great
beer
to
slowly
sip
on
o
this
is
much
more
spicy
than
fruity
and
the
yeast
plays
only
a
small
role
in
the
smell
and

pretty

of

style

you
like
tripels
youll
like
this
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
tripels
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
do
the
beer
is
rather
sweet
but
is
very
enjoyable
though
one
should
really
only
have
one
or
two
of
them
very
crisp
and
strong
good
representation
of
the
style
serving

overall
a

tripel
alittle

drop
at
times

was

there

says
this

why
jd
nice

on

some
sweet

in
here
some
spices
cloves
and
ginger
in
the
finish
along
with
some
balancing
bitterness
a
bit
fuller
mouthfeel
than
many
tripels
but
part
of
this
comes
from
the
very
high
carbonation
as
seen
in
its
gusher
status
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
tripel
i
received
it
as
a
gift
thanks
pj
and
im
not
sure
i
had
high
expectations
but
ill
seek
this
out
again
in
the
future
nice
beer
it
isnt
my
favorite
tripel
out
there
as
it
isnt
that
bold
it
goes
down
smoothly
but
the
flavor
just
isnt
quite
on
par
with
many
others
out
there
today
drinkability
this
is
an
extremely
pleasant
beer
to
drink
im
still
not
100
on
board
with
the
flavor
profile
but
i
think
given
enough
time
this
beer
might
become
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
perhaps
ill
come
back
and
review
this
again
sometime
down
the
road
still
this
is
an
intriguing
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
drink
it
again
drinkabilitythis
is
a

one

there
are
many
hard
to
compare
one
to
another

they
all
seem
to
have
their
slight
differences

my
darling
while
not
the
best
tripel
out
there
i
got
it
at

the
belgian
tripel
is
my
favorite
style
and
has
been
since
i
became
aware
of
the
wonders
of
craft
beer
it
has
been
a
while
since
ive
found
a
tripel
that
actually
lives
up
to
the
standards
of
my
first
favorite
the
st
bernardus
but
this
one
is
brazenly
approaching
that
territory
d
only
fair
this
represents
my
favorite
style

pick

a

that
distinguishes
it
from
many
of
the
other
triples
ive
tried
a
pinch
of
bitterness
is
there
but
it
seems
to
be
driven
by
the
fairly
high
level
of
carbonation
there
is
also
an
interesting
flavor
that
reminiscent
of
ripe
fruit
syrup
but
not
quite
has
a
diacetyl
edge
or
something
like
ripe
fruit
butterscotch
with
overtones
of
mustiness

it

noticeable

it

i
would
love
to
pair
this
beer
with
a
gooey
pungent
cheese
like
affidelice
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
tripel
the
light
body
makes
it
easy
to
drink
this
beer
a
bit
too
fast
the
sweeter
flavors
are
a
nice
contrast
to
the
spicier
members
of
this
style
a
very
worthy
pickup
i
would
say
that
the
7
i
paid
for
this
was
well
spent
though
if
it
was
the
same
price
as
cinq
cents
i
would
but
the
chimay
d
warming
with
a
high
abv

not
overwhelming
the
high
carbonation
dominated
the
mouth

smell
is

it
is

as
in

but
more
complex
esters
that
impart
peachy
or
apricot
flavors
characteristic
of
the
style
taste
is
much
more
bold
bursting
with
the
fruitiness
of
the
yiest
sweet
yet
balanced
peppery
spiciness
accentuated
by
the
supple
carbonation
that
coats
my
mouth
definite
honey
flavors
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
manytimes
upgraded
version
of
leffe
blonde
similar
apricoty
honeylike
sweetness
but
toned
down
in
the
feuillien
and
more
refined
and
wellintegrated
into
the
layers
of
complexity
medium
bodied
alcohol
is
very
faint
if
noticable
at
all
and
no
harsh
flavors
for
sure
i
believe
this
sample
was
fresh
and
while
i
havent
had
it
aged
its
hard
to
see
how
this
beer
can
improve
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
think
i
just
found
a
new
goto
d
not
the
best
but
worth
tring
this
beer
has
the
mainstream
taste
and
feel
of
a
triple
but
lacks
the
flavors
to
make
it
a
real
winner
honestly
if
you
put
this
into
a
bud
light
bottle
im
sure
i
would
have
said
it
was
incredible
i
had
just
heard
a
number
of
great
things
about
this
beer
and
found
it
to
be
fairly
standrad
as
far
as
belgian
beers
go
drinkability
as
tripels
go
this
one
does
a
nice
job
restraining
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
impact
that
i
often
find
objectionable
in
the
style
very
nice
taste
is
sweet
and
simple
flatness
of
the
nose
carries
into
the
flavor
this
bottle
may
have
been
past
its
prime
but
i
didnt
make
note
of
a
date
on
the
bottle
reminds
me
a
bit
if
duvel
though
not
as
rich
tastes
very
much
like
a
lager
due
in
part
to
the
low
carbonation
in
part
due
to
decent
feel
though
a
bit
thin
overall
and
with
a
light
fizzy
finish
just
vaguely
reminiscent
of
a
triple
good
drinkability
but
little
character
too
mild
nose
is
fairly
subdued
maybe
a
bit
peppery
but
its
hardly
noticeable
neither
nose
or
flavor
is
boozy
in
the
least
this
is
a
softer
tripel
flavor
is
smooth
and
mellowed
but
some
sour
pineapple
notes
pull
through
when
sucked
through
the
teeth
finishes
extremely
clean
drinkability
for
a
tripel
i
have
a
feeling
you
will
have
a
hard
time
finding
anything
smoother
not
warming
for
the
gravity
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
refreshing
standout
beer
for
what
some
think
is
probably
a
very
monolithic
style
i
sure
run
into
new
variations
all
the
time
d
well
hmmm
not
sure
where
to
go
with
this
one
i
was
anticipating
a
really
good
tripel
something
to
knock
tripel
karmeleit
off
from
its
high
pedestal
in
my
review
book
but
left
me
somewhat
let
down
its
a
good
beer
but
doesnt
wow
you
if
youre
a
fan
of
tripels
then
this
is
somewhat
on
the
lower
end
of
them
not
for
lack
of
beer
just
lack
of
depth
and
overall
finish
feel
and
drinkability
as
afore
mentioned
it
has
a
dry
finish
which
works
for
the
stlye
but
i
feel
it
doesnt
work
too
well
with
this
particular
beer
i
think
that
with
the
finish
being
dry
the
hops
should
be
spicier
and
the
general
feel
of
the
beer
should
be
crisper
instead
of
the
fat
unsophisticated
fat
blob
that
it
lays
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
real
low
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
cant
really
even
feel
in
on
the
tongue
not
even
when
looking
for
it
this
is
one
that
ill
gladly
drink
the
rest
of
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
and
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
theres
no
reason
for
me
to
go
back
to
it
nothing
is
all
that
great
about
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
the
same
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
great
tasting
brew
refreshing
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
for
sure
high
level
of
effervescence
on
the
initial
sip
the
body
is
moderate
the
flavor
truly
shows
up
in
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
the
pepper
comes
through
with
lighter
malt
in
the
background
the
post
swallow
is
mildly
sour
with
a
spicy
lingering
drinkability
once
again
light
and
mellow
a
little
boring
but
enjoyable
and
easy
d
also
good
but
average
alcohol
bite
for
a
tripel
so
that
cuts
it
a
bit
opinion
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
clean
citrusy
profile
that
makes
it
pleasant
to
drink
there
is
some
spiciness
to
it
that
comes
from
the
alcohol
that
is
a
bit
strong
for
the
overall
presentation
but
it
certainly
isnt
objectionable
this
isnt
my
favorite
tripel
but
it
is
certainly
worthy
of
a
try
d
while
certainly
a
beer
to
be
sipped
its
relatively
light
body
dry
finish
and
complexity
in
flavor
lend
this
beer
a
high
level
of
drinkability
im
glad
ive
only
got
one
since
this
could
get
me
into
some
trouble
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
bigger
abv
beer
finishes
very
clean
as
well
easy
quaffer
to
say
the
least
nice
stuff
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
am
sure
i
will
find
myself
drinking
again
best
by
date
of
160109
so
this
one
must
of
been
sitting
around
awhile
i
poured
it
more
gently
than
was
warranted
so
a
minimal
head
formed
and
settling
to
a
thin
cap
minimal
lacing
as
well
pleasant
aroma
of
fruity
esters
sweet
malt
and
candied
sugar
the
yeast
plays
a
prominent
role
in
the
flavor
combine
this
with
the
sweet
and
fruit
elements
and
you
have
a
tasty
tripel
alcohol
is
well
hiddened
with
only
a
slight
warming
affect
on
the
finish
nice
texture
to
the
body
with
ample
carbonation
a
good
belgian
and
definately
worth
a
try
i
would
definately
buy
this
again
one
of
the
rare
occasions
i
have
found
this
triple
actually
brewed
at
st
feuillien
and
this
is
drier
than
the
one
brewed
du
bouq
or
the
one
brewed
at
affligem
my
wife
made
an
amazing
roast
chicken
dinner
and
this
was
sacrificed
from
the
cellar
dry
hopped
dryness
a
slightly
boozy
finish
and
i
came
to
the
computer
so
my
wive
would
quit
helping
drink
this
beer
drinkability
not
bad
but
all
in
all
this
seemed
lacking
a
little
in
the
punch
department
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian

a
nice
cloudy

its

not

much
also
some

a

at
it
warms
up

acidic
in
the

but
not
too
extreme
somewhat
watery
kinda
bland
the
more
it
warms
up
extremely
drinkable
balanced
smooth
creamy
and
easy
drinking
d
it
is
a
very
solid
tripel
that
is
smooth
well
balanced
flavorful
and
a
joy
to
consume
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
if
it
was
not
quite
so
heavy
and
had
a
lower
abv
drinkability
i
could
go
for
just
about
any
belgian
triple
but
since
we
have
to
be
subjective
i
would
put
this
one
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
totally
worth
it
but
finer
alternatives
are
available
d
high
abv
not
apparent
at
all
this
is
not
the
best
tripel
ive
had
but
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
again
d
probably
about
as
good
as
youll
do
for
a
beer
with
8
5
abv
small
little
yeast
cake
on
the

bottom
triple
is
of
the
same
general
quality
as
the
only
other
brasserie
st
feuillien
beer
that
ive
reviewed
cuvee
de
noel
it
may
be
a
little
rougher
around
the
edges
than
the
worlds
best
but
its
still
a
worthwhile
purchase
for
those
of
us
who
cant
get
enough
of
the
style
overall
a
very
drinkable
example
of
a
kind
of
beer
that
is
all
too
often
ruined
by
generous
use
of
sugar
drinkability
high
d
good
drinkability
complexitity
and
overall
worthy
of
a
try
a
nice
crisp
drinking
tripel
that
should
yield
little
complaints
d
i
liked
this
triple
a
lot
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
it
other
beers
had
muscled
it
to
the
back
of
my
fridge
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good

definitely
a

might
only
have
a
few
of
these
makes
you
burp
alot
sweet

nicely
balanced
by
the
spiciness
om

mouthfeel
more
wheat

like
very
spicy
average
triple
d
for
8
5
abv
this
is
ridiculously
drinkable
i
am
severely
disappointed
i
dont
have
more
of
these
to
drink
drinkability
i
suppose
i
should
say
that
when
i
cracked
open
the
bottle
and
later
checked
the
cap
after
id
consumed
it
there
was
an
odd
brown
color
that
of
which
ive
never
seen
could
that
be
oxidation
im
not
sure
but
i
know
i
wouldnt
try
this
again
the
bottle
didnt
explode
or
anything
and
the
taste
wasnt
peculiarly
out
of
context
or
anything
but
i
have
a
feeling
something
may
have
happened
to
it
as
far
as
oxidation
but
im
not
sure
d
excellent
i
am
shocked
that
a
beer
this
good
is
not
more
popular
in
belgian
selections
at
us
liquor
stores
the
price
is
excellent
too
i
think
i
paid
8
bucks
for
a
750
i
highly
recommend
this
one
and
pretty
much
anything
else
from
st
feuillien
for
that
matter
drank
this
at
sunnys
restaurant
bangalore
served
in
the
correct
glass
nice
pours
a
cloudy
blond
floral
odors
that
match
with
the
initial
floral
flavors
and
then
turning
slightly
yeasty
slightly
sweet
but
i
love
the
complexity
in
this
beer
clean
after
taste
d
this
is
drinkable
beer
its
a
solid
example
of
a
tripel
though
not
necessarily
my
favorite
of
the
style
breaks
the
fog
of
pollution
in
this
citys
atmosphere
crisp
and
clean
very
nice
aftertaste
is
strong
but
doesnt
linger
above
average
and
great
for
bangalore
i
miss
good
beer
and
this
is
a
nice
replacement
750ml
corked
caged
cloudy
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
whatsoever
so
far
looking
tripel
by
the
brewerys
claim
only
smell
is
far
better
honey
apricots
not
a
lot
going
on
but
what
is
makes
me
happy
taste
is
ground
pepper
fruits
caramel
and
a
crisp
apple
finish
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
with
enough
bubbles
to
make
me
happier
still
drinkability
is
excellent
the
alcohol
is
just
a
faint
warmth
on
the
way
down
the
balanced
flavor
is
very
very
drinkable
if
youre
thinking
tripel
i
would
lean
this
way
without
hesitation
mouthfeel
is
tangy
and
sour
very
drinkable

enjoyed
this
tripel
in
a
snifter
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
incredible
carbonation
that
created
a
23
finger
head
that
never
dissipated
poured
a
golden
murk
and
then
the
bouquet
came
the
snifter
helped
capture
the
prevailing
clean
smells
of
spice
pepper
and
citrusreminiscent
aroma
of
a
hot
spicedorange
tea
the
taste
was
what
was
expected
similar
to
the
aromasquite
clean
and
crisp
with
an
enjoyable
linger
this
is
not
an
overpowering
ale
somewhat
mellow
and
would
be
a
good
introductory
beer
for
this
style
mouthfeel
was
again
clean
with
a
light
and
fresh
zest
i
enjoyed
all
750ml
and
couldve
went
for
more
in
the
same

againgood
entertainment
beverage
excellent
stuff
definitely
recommended
overall
a
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
tripel
i
can
see
the
majority
of
people
that
like
beer
finding
this
one
quite
tastey
there
is
nothing
in
it
i
find
offensive
unless
you
absolutely
hate
beers
on
the
sweeter
side
or
lots
of
carbonation
and
see
a
lot
of
good
qualities
in
this
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
recommend
it
to
other
beer
people
and
also
suggest
it
to
noobs
if
available
in
a
word
yum
the
hopping
rates
and
freshness
took
me
by
surprise
similar
to
poperings
hommel
in
the
hop
character
but
not
as
strong
the
fresh
hops
blend
well
with
the
phenols
to
create
a
sharp
but
pleasant
bitterness
while
offering
a
lot
of
herbal
and
estery
character
the
pilsner
malts
remain
smooth
and
sweet
but
offer
a
dry
crispness
that
only
tripels
can
can
deleiver
sweet
confectionate
suars
balance
the
spicy
alcohols
and
create
a
lot
of
upfront
intrique
esters
offer
a
ripe
fruit
variety
of
peaches
pears
apricots
berries
and
tropical
pineapples
and
mangos
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
tingle
to
the
mouth
and
a
warm
tart
sensation
it
is
not
likely
that
tripels
get
any
better
than
this
i
might
have
rated
this
a
bit
higher
but
i
cant
say
it
stands
up
to
other
tripels
ive
had
from
belgium
as
much
as
i
would
like
the
lemony
character
was
a
bit
too
much
imo
overall
though
there
was
an
herbal
character
that
is
done
well
and
balances
out
the
lemon
pretty
well
it
is
an
interesting
tripel
on
its
own
right
pale
golden
slightly
hazy
with
a
big
very
creamy
head
aroma
is
quite
fruity
with
a
touch
of
phenolic
spiciness
very
nice
flavor
a
lot
more
hops
than
i
expected
from
the
nose
with
their
strong
bitterness
pairing
nicely
with
lots
of
yeasty
honeyish
fruitiness
the
finish
is
tart
and
dry
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
not
a
bad
example
of
a
tripel
at
all
pours
with
a
good
head
and
leaves
a
nice
leg
the
smell
is
fruity
and
crisp
with
little
lasting
aroma
very
fresh
on
the
pallate
with
a
nice
lingering
taste
that
ties
in
perfectly
with
a
fresh
sip
overall
a
good
addition
to
any
collection
and
a
great
way
to
introduce
the
uninitiated
to
this
style
pours
a
hazed
gold
with
almost
no
head
out
of
a
330
ml
bottle
nose
is
typical
yeast
and
sugar
though
the
sugar
is
only
a
minor
edge
flavor
is
crisp
with
a
slight
bitter
edge
to
a
larger
sweet
profile
kind
of
tangy
a
bit
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
too
feel
is
very
high
on
bubble
a
big
effervescence
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
drinkable
yes
it
is
a
smooth
tripel
yet
it
does
not
have
much
outstanding
character
to
speak
of
decent
but
no
home
run
woody
yeasty
aroma
brilliantly
clear
for
a
bottle
aged
beer
very
light
straw
colored
nice
high
carbonation
from

nice
dry
finish
a
little
bit
one
dimensional
lacks
that
fat
mouthfeel
that
the
most
exceptional
tripels
have
midpalate
but
the
simplicity
of
this
one
would
really
make
this
one
go
well
with
a
meal
or
some
cheese
a
great
tripel
all
in
all
this
is
avery
decent
triple
available
in
bc
in
corked
and
caged
big
bottles
the
main
thing
about
this
triple
is
the
nice
clean
fruity
body
and
the
great
balance
to
the
finish
not
world
class
but
certainly
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
worth
picking
up
for
the
cellar
drinkability
heavier
than
expected
from
original
pour
and

quafs
gets
better
as
you
move
down

a
cloudy

that
are

taste

a
small
bit
watery
a
dry
aftertaste
with
alcohol
that
just
sits
with
you
a
nice
triple
dry
yeasty
and
a
good
body
this
belgium
native
is
a
very
distinguished
brew
i
enjoy
it
entirely
except
for
the
price
fourteen
bucks
for
a
four
pack
is
a
bit
stiff
where
im
from
id
do
the
math
but
this
head
has
me
all
turned
around
and
ive
still
got
half
a
glass
to
go
if
you
get
the
chance
give
this
one
a
try
d
this
is
a
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
tripel
its
refreshing
in
the
summer
months
i
will
have
this
again
extremely
tasty
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
highly
recommended
good
belgian
and

introduction
oelergud
i
cant
say
this
beer
blows
me
away
but
its
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
the
abv
is
very
well
disguised
and
one
feels
as
if
it
would
be
no
trouble
to
down
several
of
these
however
at
8

thats
probably
not
a
great
idea
poured
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
the
color
is
a
cloudy
pale
orange
with
an
average
white
head
nothing
special
that
left
some
spot
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
good
typical

belgian
candi

tart
applepear
not
the
strongest
smelling
tripel
but
decent
the
taste
is
of
the
candi

tart
pear
some
champagne
the
feel
is
moderate
with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
tart
a
middle
of

belgian
tripel
which
is
still
a
very
good
beer
but
not
at
the
same
level
as
the
top
tier
tripels
the
flavors
arent
as
bold
and
the
pour
is
not
as
explosive
and
the
lacing
is
not
up
to
standard
this
brew
doesnt
really
standout
from
the
top
tier
tripels
but
is
still
a
good
selection
and
absolutely
worth
a
try
you
not
go
wrong
with
this
fine
triple
do
it
d
good
a
bit
too
mild
as
i
prefer
a
pronounced
tripel
drinkability
its
a
pretty
accessible
tripel
regardless
of
what
the
label
says
its
got
enough
nice
flavors
to
keep
me
interested
long
enough
to
finish
the
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
make
a
session
out
of
it
even
if
i
were
going
to
stay
in
the
style
from
a
bottle
at
bon
vivant
suffolk
clear
and
golden
with
almost
no
haziness
although
id
have
expected
some
solid
light
fizzy
head
acidic
and
an
almost
vinegary
aroma
smoother
palate
than
the
aroma
suggested
sharply
bitter
at

tight
almost

served

st
feuillien
chalice
the
beer
pours
bright
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
has
a
musty
citrusy
smell
and
also
smells
like
cloves
and
bananas
the
taste
is
very
spicy
and
fruity
pretty
much
the
same
way
it
smells
theres
a
nice
tang
to
the
taste
it
has
a
medium
body
but
the
mouthfeel
is
too
carbonatedfoamy
for
me
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
more
bubbles
than
liquid
this
also
affects
the
drinkability
if
it
was
less
carbonated
it
would
be
much
easier
to
drink
its
a
good
beer
but
imo
it
would
be
much
better
if
they
cut
down
on
the
carbonation
some
to
me
this
has
a
unique
taste
for
a
tripel
there
seems
to
be
more
hops
infused
into
this
brew
more
than
other
beers
of
this
nature
there
is
a
slight
tinge
of
honey
here
too
this
brew
has
a
spike
of
co2
at
first
but
wets
the
palate
quite
nicely
and
finishes
warm
pours
semicloudy
light
copper
color
the
head
is
thick
to
start
out
but
eventually
tames
down
to
a
nice
layer
the
aroma
is
very
abundant
i
could
smell
it
when
it
was
sitting
on
the
table
in
front
of
me
and
smells
of
ester
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
but
you
can
sense
the
presence
of
the
high
alcohol
the
was
a
slight
burn
going
down
the
throat
but
not
bad
the
taste
is
just
unbelievable
it
is
very
malty
and
moderately
hoppy
and
the
alcohol
lingers
in
the
mouth
it
kinda
hard
to
improve
on
this
beer
because
tripels
dont
get
much
better
than
this
not
breathtakingly
good
orange
and
slippery
with
a
fluffy
mouthfeel
decent
superb
in
every
way
the
taste
was
the
best
ive
tried
good
spiciness
and
hoppy
balance
the
malt
shows
up
the
entire
time
the
mouthfeel
is
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
placed
right
in
the
middle
that
makes
for
an
easy
sipping
brew

to
gusler
this
is
surprisingly
a
good
tripel
with
no
aftertaste
if
i
did
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
have
guessed
allagash
or
ommegang
it
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
was
sad
when
the
beer
was
gone
this
is
the
perfect
tripel
high
gravity
equates
super
quality
go
find
it
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
perhaps
a
little
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
that
sweetness
is
generally
part
of
the
tripel
style
this
seems
to
me
like
a
good
beer
to
drink
in
the
winterholiday
months
with
its
candylike
sweetness
and
high
abv
im
glad
i
got
a
4pack
of
these
and
will
be
sure
to
save
at
least
one
or
two
for
the
upcoming
winter
o
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
since
new
holland
is
usually
nothing
to
scream
about
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
of
theirs
second
only
to
dragons
milk
now
thats
a
cold
beer
ha
it
has
a
thickness
to
the
body
that
maybe
is
a
result
of
its
deep
freeze
it
loosened
up
quickly
enough
its
got
the
haziness
of
a
belgian
tripel
smells
a
little
like
pineapples
behind
the
belgian
yeast
and
boozy
really
nice
overall
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
from
an
american
brewery
new
holland
always
does
a
good
job
of
executing
their
styles
the
booze
is
well
integrated
and
many
traditional
tones
shine
through
o
a
standard
text
book
tripel
not
positive
why
its
50
more
expensive
than
other
text
book
american
made
triples
but
i
digress
picked
this
up
in
totowa
last
week
having
never
had
this
before
i
hadnt
had
a
beer
from
new
holland
in
quite
some
time
but
all
of
the
ones
that
i
enjoyed
previously
were
well
worth
the
money
i
spent
on
them
and
this
was
no
exception
the
balance
was
great
the
mouthfeel
addictive
and
the
alcohol
was
wellhidden
the
hardest
part
of
reviewing
this
was
pacing
myself
to
ensure
that
i
had
some
left
by
the
time
i
finished
writing
this
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
rather
sweet
for
the
style
but
hides
its
alcohol
a
rather
well
from
the
taste
overall
a
nice
and
citrusy
tripel
i
would
not
mind
trying
this
one
with
a
bit
of
aging
tasty
but
i
have
had
better
in
the
style
certainly
worth
a
try
but
i
will
reach
for
other
favorites
first
palate
light
to
medium
watery
lively
carbonation
o
an

i
wish
this
was
in

distribution
0
really
a
great
beer
that
exceeded
my
expectations
a
fantastic
triple
which
is
closer
to
a
belgian
triple
than
most
of
the
american
triples
my
only
criticism
of
this
beer
is
that
it
only
does
a
decent
job
of
hiding
the
high
abv
i
have
had
beers
in
the
9
and
10
percent
range
that
have
done
a
much
better
job
enjoyed
again
with
sheeps
mile

and

some

and
finale
of

after
super

kayak
o

if
your
into

this
is
one
of
the
better
trippels
ive
tried
in
recent
memory
and
at

it
can
be
deceiving
overall
a
good
american
tripel

a

belgian

the

i
can
tell
you
that
7

is
too
much
i
can
only
handle
small
sips
of
this
beer
i
will
have
to
try
this
fresh
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
but
please
dont
age
this
for
7
yrs
unless
you
want
to
play
a
joke
on
someone
this
beer
is
a
sugary
mess
not

why
its

very

all
around
good

and
very
smooth
to

on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
calling
new
hollands
black
tulip
a
tripel
is
approximately
as
deceiving
as
the
decision
to
name
marc
forsters
recent
zombie
apocalypse
film
world
war
z
both
of
them
deviate
so
grandly
from
their
original
frameworkinspiration
that
the
name
carryover
seems
little
more
than
marketing
savvy
hey
people
who
liked
this
thing
youll
like
this
thing
too
i
mean
belgian
strong
pale
is
a
good
classification
why
not
take
advantage
of
it
all
in
all
a
good
belgian
style
beer
but
not
near
the
best
tripels
i
have
tried
in
any
case
this
is
probably
my
favorite
offering
at
new
holland
now
and
definitely
the
best
american
trippel
ive
had
overall
id
drink
this
again
for
my
personal
preferences
though
i
wouldnt
go
seeking
it
out
but
definitely
a
good
beer
brewed
the
right
way
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
could
not
see
myself
calling
it
outstanding
very
nice
indeed
oa
solid
domestic
tripel
not
at
the
top
of
the
style
but
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
i
like
this
one
a
lot
id
call
it
a
classic
belgian
very
refreshing
and
satisfying
o
very
drinkable
nice
i
would
certainly
have
again
my
comments
seem
critical
and
maybe
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
better
but
the
reviews
are
mixed
so
maybe
this
is
one
of
those
that
everybody
has
a
different
opinion
over
im
just
doing
this
to
try
to
improve
my
tasting
abilities
esp
with
the
belgians
i
expected
to
like
it
better
than
mm
but
i
think
mm
will
still
be
my
standby
not
saying
there
arent
better
tripels
but
easy
access
to
weyerbacher
products
here
and
theyre
always
reliably
excellent
but
im
very
close
between
black
tulip
and
mm
and
wouldnt
be
the
least
bit
disappointed
if
i
went
somewhere
that
only
had
bt
but
not
mm
certainly
worth
trying
and
seeing
whos
review
you
agree
with
o
very
full
flavored
example
of
the
style
the
tulip
time
celebration
has
just
come
and
gone
and
it
got
me
wondering
whether
new
holland
was
still
putting
this
out
lucky
me
found
this
at
the
copper
vine
im
thinking
of
hitting
up
the
new
holland
tap
room
this
week
maybe
a
tap
offering
is
in
order
overall
a
solid
american
trippel
but
i
have
had
better
that
were
easier
to
find
and
less
expensive
pretty
good
but
not
worth
the
hefty
price
that
seems
common
with
big
new
holland
beers
o
not
a
bad
beer
obliviously
the
bros
like
this
one
there
are
certain
malt
profiles
that
have
a
glue
taste
for
me
this
might
be
one
that
is
right
on
for
you
try
one
on
o
not
bad
a
bit
too
sweet
with
the
alcohol
showing
a
bit
too
much
but
overall
pretty
tasty
o
was
hesitant
at
first
to
spend
16
on
a
4
pack
but
this
beer
really
came
through
will
definitely
purchase
next
time
im
looking
for
a
tripel
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
probably
will
pick
up
some
more
for
experimental
cellar
aging
next
time
they
are
available
to
see
if
i
can
pull
back
that
booziness
and
accentuate
the
fruitiness
a
bit
my
palate
is
a
bit
oversensitive
to
alcohol
hotness
however
so
ymmv
i
feel
like
this
is
another
one
of
those
trytoohard
ales
from
new
holland
not
the
biggest
fan
of
their
high
gravity
series
but
black
tulip
is
really
not
that
far
removed
from
your
average
belgian
tripel
overall
a
moderatly
tasty
triple
with
good
fruit
flavors
one
to
try
if
the
chance
arises
but
not
one
to
go
out
of
the
way
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
twofinger
white
head
no
sediment
in
the
bottle
the
smell
immediately
reminded
me
of
other
americanmade
tripel
theres
a
sharp
strong
orange
spice
and
then
a
slightly
stringent
bitterness
in
the
flavor
its
not
subtle
enough
or
complex
enough
id
even
say
its
too
clean
id
guess
the
temperature
is
a
little
off
during
fermentation
a
lot
of
the
right
flavors
or
something
resembling
them
are
present
all
the
ingredient
seem
right
id
want
to
look
at
the
process
to
improve
this
beer
i
want
more
fark
it
i
am
getting
more
good
beer
i
bought
a
single
bottle
now
i
might
get
a
six
pack
decent
tripel
but
too
hot
maybe
needs
some
cellar
time
overall
not
something
i
would
have
again
especially
at
3
50
a
pop
but
it
was
nice
to
try
it
in
a
12oz
version
not
a
bad
version
of
the
style
at
all
pours
beautifully
clear
and
golden
colored
aroma
of
pears
white
grapes
slight
citrus
and
spice
a
good
bit
of
honey
taste
is
very
up
front
with
the
fruit
and
a
nice
sweetness
on
the
way
down
lots
of
pears
and
honey
some
citrus
and
on
the
sweet
side
in
the
style
a
little
heavy
on
the
style
light
carbonation
but
i
like
this
smooth
and
nicely
crafted
by
new
holland
poured
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
holds
great
retention
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
very
pleasant
with
banana
belgian
yeast
fresh
flowers
tastes
are
well
balanced
with
notes
of
banana
belgian
yeast
spice
grass
tulips
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
medium
bodied
finishes
spicy
with
a
sharp
tingle
on
the
tongue
alcohol
is
undetectable
in
taste
but
is
warming
aftertaste
is
somewhat
odd
yet
pleasant
presumably
the
tulip
flavor
lingering
its
not
offputting
just
different
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
unique
ale
its
seems
light
and
refreshing
yet
its
bold
with
the
high
abv
flavors
meld
perfectly
ive
had
other
beers
brewed
with
flowers
and
never
really
liked
them
much
as
the
flower
was
overwhelming
this
was
not
stellar
treat
on
tap
clear
golden
pour
great
lacing
strong
scent
of
banana
clove
and
sourdough
taste
much
the
same
with
a
bit
of
cinammon
and
malt
well
balanced
thick
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
tripel
though
pales
in
comparison
to
final
absolution
another
excellent
michigan
tripel
good
example
of
a
tripel
but
at
the
cost
i
would
be
better
off
buying
st
bernardus
or
chimay
white
o
i
like
this
trippel
nice
body
nice
flavored
drinks
a
bit
like
a
souped
up
hefeweizen
this
was
an
average
overall
tripel
experience
for
me
certainly
not
the
best
of
the
style
the
price
seemed
a
bit
high
considering
how
many
good
tripels
there
are
on
the
market
id
rather
have
several
imports
over
this
and
they
would
cost
nearly
the
same
ive
personally
come
across
more
enjoyable
american
interpretations
of
the
style
i
also
think
412oz
bottle
is
a
little
steep
when
i
can
get
a
real
interpretation
of
the
style
from
belgium
for
the
same
price
this
can
be
an
enjoyable
beer
but
just
dont
expect
something
that
rivals
overseas
average
says
it
all
really
surprised
at
how
good
this
is
almost
a
cross
between
a
hefe
and
a
tripel
the
flavor
is
outstanding
and
the
price
is
great
too
for
such
a
quality
brew
the
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
the
overall
scores
a
5
while
the
components
do
not
it
adds
up
to
something
more
complete
and
fulfilling
than
its
components
hint
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
pretty
average
example
of
the
style
there
were
some
good
aspects
with
this
beer
but
when
it
came
to
the
taste
it
started
to
go
down
hill
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
the
sweetness
and
booze
made
it
not
that
smooth
and
the
flavors
just
couldnt
hold
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
very
true
to
style
and
nicely
done
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
too
sweet
and
a
little
bland
pretty
rough
around
the
edges
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
much
rather
have
arbors
phat
abbot
its
cheaper
and
much
better
tasting
i
was
a
little
let
down
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
nice
tripel
and
thats
what
i
got
till
i
got
to
the
taste
then
it
went
down
hill
i
had
their
beer
hive
tripel
and
didnt
care
for
it
and
this
one
seemed
to
follow
suit
but
it
wasnt
nearly
as
bad
as
the
beer
hive
in
my
opinion
phat
abbot
is
still
the
best
michigan
made
tripel
new
holland
can
make
some
pretty
good
beers
but
when
it
comes
to
tripels
they
always
fall
short
maybe
this
style
just
isnt
for
you
guys
better
luck
next
time
this
is
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
really
an
excellent
little
tripel
and
is
one
of
the
few
american
tripels
i
have
encountered
that
perfectly
nails
the
classic
flavor
components
of
the
style
i
would
have
no
problem
recommending
this
to
anyone
interested
in
belgian
ales
o
the
dimensions
of
this
beer
combine
to
make
something
really
special
goes
down
o
so
smooth
im
not
sure
that
is
closely
aligns
with
the
tripel
style
but
i
think
new
holland
has
created
something
special
with
black
tulip
i
will
look
forward
to
its
return
o
nice
balance
of
flavors
floral
and
citrus
notes
are
enjoyable
but
overall
this
is
not
as
bigfull
flavored
as
most
tripels
i
would
have
it
again
if
on
tap
and
was
in
the
mood
though
d
nice
flavor
probably
not
one
id
go
for
again
i
probably
shouldnt
have
let
it
sit
as
long
as
i
did
and
i
would
like
to
compare
it
to
a
fresh
one
overall
this
is
a
nice
rendition
of
a
tripel
sweeter
than
i
had
expected
and
the
aroma
didnt
transfer
as
much
to
the
taste
as
most
beers
do
pretty
enjoyable
o
this
remains
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
like
the
americanized
take
on
the
trippel
style
definitely
beats
out
even
some
of
the
true
trippels
for
me
the
flavor
is
one
of
the
most
unique
ive
had
combining
the
style
with
aspects
of
a
weizen
or
even
hefeweizen
id
definitely
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
but
the
truly
lucky
will
find
it
on
tap
even
better
from
notes
tasted
on
draft
at
the
publican
pours
clear
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
nose
is
belgian
yeast
strong
honey
sweetness
and
a
nice
floral
note
flavor
is
sweet
with
clover
honey
some
orange
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
very
well
balanced
the
body
is
fairly
full
and
coating
with
average
carbonation
and
a
long
bitter
honey
finish
doverall
i
was
hoping
for
alittle
more
from
this
beer
but
i
was
still
satisfied
it
had
good
flavor
but
maybe
alittle
off
in
balance
i
would
def
drink
this
one
again
but
prob
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
very
well
done
and
a
great
beer
o
i
didnt
care
for
this
but
as
i
mentioned
above
that
could
just
be
due
to
the
age
i
hope
to
retry
a
fresh
one
down
the
line
i
was
delightfully
surprised
especially
considering
this
was
a
new
holland
effort
not
that
they
dont
make
fabulous
beerbecause
they
dobut
because
this
was
so
much
better
than
many
of
the
socalled
belgianstyle
micros
out
there
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
bready
yeast
flavor
that
adds
fullness
to
the
mouthfeel
theres
a
prominent
spice
character
up
front
with
lots
of
pepper
and
coriander
dominating
the
flavor
and
lingering
throughout
slight
hints
of
esterslight
fruit
especially
banana
apple
and
pear
slightly
one
dimensional
with
an
overwhelming
abrasive
spice
flavor
and
astringent
solvent
alcohol
in
the
finish
d
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
hides
its
abv
well
i
like
this
beer
and
i
would
definitely
buy
more
from
notes
i
originally
ranked
at
a
45
but
had
to
notch
it
up
a
half
point
after
i
realized
how
much
i
had
drank
without
realizing
amidst
the
thickness
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
thanks
dan
for
recommending
it
to
me
i
have
nothing
to
challenge
your
tastes
of
a
new

that
very
closely
resembles
the
belgian
masterpiece
it
is
called
very
fruity
and
sugary
with
a
pep
of
spice
included
feels
nice
and
well
cheers
overall
nice
brew
but
nothing
mind
boggling
would
recommend
drinking
this
one
fresh
versus
aged
fernmaster
tells
me
that
black
tulip
is
much
better
ontap
than
this
bottle
was
but
i
am
reviewing
the
bottled
version
and
the
bottled
version
is
solid
in
many
ways
with
plenty
of
missed
potential
d
damn
tasty
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
and
the
flavors
come
together
very
well
into
a
beer
that
i
fear
could
be
very
dangerous
pretty
good
sipper
d
cant
drink
it
alot
high
abv
makes
a
bomber
buzz
me
would
be
better
off
as
a
nightcap
during
the
summer
an
excellent
beer
d
good
but
not
great
i
remember
this
being
better
a
couple
years
ago
when
i
tried
it
maybe
my
tastes
have
changed
id
order
at
a
bar
but
not
a
second
i
dont
think
ill
buy
a
bottle
again
i
just
didnt
love
it
may
be
the
style
average
beer
overall
i
will
not
purchase
again
through
the
roof
drinkability
this
is

abv
good
take
on
the
style
man
i
wish
we
got
more
new
holland
down
in
joplin
mo
drinkability
is
really
the
only
part
that
suffers
here
black
tulip
is
delicious
no
doubt
but
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
i
think
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
especially
so
if
you
have
a
bomber
d
ok
flavoring
goes
down
ok
ok
representation
of
style
i
would
definitely
reach
for
others
though
d
well
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
either
the
malt
is
way
too
sweet
and
thick
this
hurts
the
drinkability
and
also
holds
down
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
the
yeast
and
hops
are
appropriate
but
the
combination
of
cloying
malt
and
insufficient
carbonation
make
them
seem
flat
and
muddy
a
drinkable
beer
but
any
store
that
carries
this
almost
certainly
also
carries
another
better
trippel
notes
maybe
the
most
unique
tripel
that
i
can
recall
drinking
people
who
enjoy
a
nice
belgian
barley
yeast
and
floral
taste
will
enjoy
it
is
not
very
sweet
as
is
the
case
for
most
tripels
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
lots
of
bubblely
carbonation
overall
a
very
solid
beer
glad
i
bought
a
few
of
em
to
enjoy
later
d
pretty
good
at
first
but
the
sugary
sweetness
and
funky
spice
overwhelms
the
nice
fruits
this
beer
has
to
offer
decent
though
d
the
spiciness
is
a
tad
cloying
in
combination
with
the
sweetness
and
overpowers
most
everything
else
the
more
i
drink
it
the
less
i
want
to
be
drinking
it
a
moderately
good
triple
in
the
world
of
triples
ps
i
hate
when
they
call
a
beer
high
gravity
right
on
the
bottle
it
reminds
me

i
am
really
enjoying
this
not
sure
if
it
is
a
tripel
or
more
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
but
i
really
do
not
care
this
poured
a
clear
dark
gold
with
some
white
head
it
smelled
like
a
typical
trippel
with
dominant
sour
wild
yeast
and
lemon
hops
with
light
copper
and
grassy
malts
it
tasted
like
sour
lemon
and
metallic
copper
hops
with
surprisingly
strong
barley
and
caramel
malt
and
bready
yeast
it
was
moderately
thick
with
some
smooth
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
nicely
enjoyable
trippel
it
smelled
pretty
sour
but
the
taste
was
much
more
malty
and
balanced
that
along
with
a
great
silky
body
and
fairly
well
hidden
alcohol
made
this
very
easy
to
drink
it
wasnt
very
complex
or
delicate
compared
to
some
other
pale
belgians
but
i
really
liked
it
especially
on
a
summer
evening
fruity
aroma
of
pears
apple
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
spicy
quaff
conters
the
initial
sweetness
leaving
the
fruit
for
a
hot
finish
actually
the
spicy
hotness
lingers
for
a
short
bit
interfering
with
a
clean
drinking
experience
not
a
bad
trippel
but
not
one
that
ill
be
hankering
to
get
again
22oz
bottle
into
a
duvel
snifter
a
nice
hazy
bubbly
pale
orange
with
a
thin
eggshell
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
nice
amount
of
sweet
malts
and
decent
spice
the
taste
is
an
intriguing
blend
of
sweet
malt
rock
candy
and
nice
spice
with
slight
sweet
fruits
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
some
alcohol
presence
but
the
9
well
hidden
this
is
a
very
respectable
american
brewed
tripel
this
one
really
surprised
me
i
cant
believe
i
havent
had
it
before
this
since
ive
seen
it
so
many
times
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
not
quite
as
funky
as
a
tru
belgian
but
damn
tasty
creamy
and
delicious
cant
wait
to
find
this
again
it
is
a
beautiful
pour
golden
hazy
with
a
bright
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
small
amount
of
lacing
it
smells
sweet
and
fruity
the
yeast
is
very
present
you
can
taste
the
malt
and
the
fruit
there
is
a
slight
spice
back
note
but
not
much
it
has
a
full
mouth
fell
with
a
great
finish
i
hear
its
not
going
to
be
around
any
more
i
could
definitely
drink
another
bottle
a
single
12
ounce
bottle
picked
up
at
goldsteins
deli
in
kingston
for
around
3
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
tripel
appears
a
hazy
bright
apricot
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
orange
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
honey
orange
sweet
and
fruity
belgian
yeast
notesesters
a
slightly
syrupy
body
with
ample
carbonation
for
a
tripel
alcohol
is
nearly
invisible
making
this
one
quite
drinkable
but
be
careful
itll
sneak
up
on
you
without
much
warning
d
i
think
i
would
stop
with
one
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
fact
that
this
is
very
good
definite
earthy
smell
and
taste
surprisingly
heavy
mouthfeel
very
rich
more
akin
to
a
dubbel
than
a
trippel
at
first
blush
extralong
finish
more
earthiness
and
maybe
some
dark
fruit
dangerously
drinkable
especially
for
9
bartender
indicated
that
he
was
near
the
bottom
of
the
keg
and
maybe
nearing
the
end
of
its
shelf
life
i
would
love
to
know
what
its
like
when
freshly
tapped
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
as
a
result
of
the
high
level
of
carbonation
the
beer
pours
the
color
of
honey
looking
rich
and
viscuous
head
retention
is
no
better
then
fair
but
there
is
considerable
sticky
lacing
on
the
nose
i
get
an
aroma
of
more
honey
but
its
interlaced
with
some
gingerale
orange
and
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
quite
rich
sweet
and
complex
i
get
honey
butter
orange
maraschino
cherry
flowers
and
some
very
noticeable
hoppy
bitterness
the
bitterness
helps
to
counter
the
sweetness
in
this
beer
very
well
giving
some
welcome
balance
to
this
medium
bodied
beer
alcohol
is
pretty
well
disguised
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
the
somewhat
excessive
sweetness
detracts
a
bit
from
this
beers
drinkability
theres
also
something
of
an
odd
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
and
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
from
hops
nevertheless
this
is
a
solid
interesting
to
drink
beer
that
im
glad
to
have
had
an
opportunity
to
try
dgood
gold
colored
ale
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
actually
looks
like
a
macrosmell
is
dominated
by
malts
taste
is
sugar
canecitrus
and
a
hint
of
banana
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
and
this
beer
goes
down
fairly
easy
i
would
recommend
and
would
purchase
again
i
say
if
your
a
fan
of
belgian
triples
youll
like
this
one
dont
pass
this
one
up
exceptional
balance
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
d
delicious
subtle
strong
tall
creamy
offwhite
head
sits
atop
the
hazy
golden
beer
smells
like
spring
flowers
mixed
with
faint
yeast
smooth
light
mouthfeel
that
is
full
enough
to
carry
the
rich
flavors
vanilla
orange
peel
a
bit
of
yeast
spiciness
something
about
it
reminds
me
of
popperings
hommel
beer
which
is
a
great
thing
this
is
one
tasty
beer
but
watch
out
for
the
alcohol
d
very
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
like
several
of
the
beers
ive
been
drinking
lately
this
one
got
a
little
buried
in
my
stash
and
picked
up
a
little
bit
of
age
as
a
result
ive
had
mixed
results
in
aging
tripels
but
i
think
the
age
has
served
this
particular
beer
well
its
fun
to
try
and
get
a
handle
on
this
flavor
big
and
fruity
and
sweet
without
being
cloying
sticky
and
assertive
without
being
rude
perhaps
not
the
most
authentically
belgiantasting
tripel
but
i
appreciate
new
hollands
take
on
it
nonetheless
d
this
comes
off
to
me
as
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
certainly
one
of
the
better
tripels
i
have
tried
recently
one
bottle
is
enough
but
i
think
ill
revisit
this
one
again
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
check
it
out
d
wow
i
had
no
idea
going
in
this
was
9
abv
this
could
spell
trouble
if
you
dont
be
careful
dynamite
stuff
will
definitely
drink
again
pours
a
clean
golden
color
with
a
shortlived
white
head
aroma
is
mostly
malty
and
candy
sugar
sweet
with
notes
of
white
nectarine
tangerine
and
hints
of
alcohol
taste
is
mostly
sweet
with
notes
of
alcohols
citruslike
fruitiness
and
and
almost
lager
like
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
alcohol
like
small
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
kind
of
basic
for
triple
nice
though
picked
up
at
greens
in
greenville
south
carolina
as
new
holland
is
yet
to
make
it
down
in
georgia
the
color
of
the
pour
looked
good
with
a
pale
golden
hazy
body
but
the
carbonation
was
pathetic
for
the
style
and
formed
nearly
no
head
at
all
the
smell
was
good
with
a
mix
of
light
perfume
and
booze
the
was
good
to
start
off
as
there
was
hop
bitterness
yeasty
earthiness
and
some
funk
but
mid
sip
the
honeydew
melon
like
sweetness
took
over
the
taste
the
finish
was
spicybitterearthy
but
a
little
too
short
lived
the
body
felt
right
in
terms
of
viscosity
but
the
relative
lack
of
carbonation
made
it
feel
dull
and
less
full
of
zest
the
brewery
gave
this
a
decent
effort
but
came
up
just
a
little
short
d
on
the
whole
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
though
its
not
the
best
example
of
a
trippel
ive
ever
had
the
taste
wasnt
as
vibrant
as
id
hoped
for
a
drinkable
beer
nonetheless
the
next
milestone
on
our
exploration
of
the
belgian
begins
with
an
attractively
designed
bottle
directly
applied
to
the
glass
orangeyellow
hazy
syrupy
product
emerges
into
the
glass
with
a
minimal
head
which
tends
to
dissipate
quite
rapidly
not
one
of
those
frothy
affairs
this
beer
makes
its
presence
felt
very
distinctive
aroma
and
flavor
profile
plenty
of
ester
and
resin
on
the
nose
with
some
orchard
fruit
there
is
notable
sweetness
up
front
almost
sugary
which
transitions
to
a
distinct
bitterness
ike
something
of
a
bitter
root
very
distinct
aromatics
good
if
not
our
favourite
d
dangerously
smooth
quite
good
masks
the
9
well
d
definitely
not
the
best
tripel
in
the
world
at
least
in
my
book
but
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
wonderfully
drinkable
i
could
relax
and
sip
on
a
couple
of
these
as
a
sidenotei
really
enjoy
the
artwork
on
the
bottle
of
this
beer
d
though
this
is
not
exactly
like
too
many
belgian
trippels
i
have
had
it
is
more
belgian
than
most
american
interpretations
the
hops
are
the
kicker
sort
of
makes
me
think
of
the
chouffe
double
ipa
trippel
beer
only
less
hoppy
completely
worthwhile
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
looks
really
beautiful
in
color
smell
is
good
too
has
a
wonderful
yeasty
presence
to
it
as
well
taste
is
awesome
it
dances
on
the
tongue
and
kicks
its
butt
with
an
overload
of
yeast
sugary
malt
and
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
to
it
a
wonderful
tasting
beer
a
unique
take
on
the
style
but
falls
short
of
being
a
truly
great
triple
or
funky
enough
to
be
a
wild
ale
the
mouthfeel
suffers
from
a
pungent
faintly
sour
aftertaste
that
is
offputting
something
that
reduces
the
drinkability
of
a
fairly
good
beer
its
almost
better
to
characterize
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
of
black
tulip
as
a
farmhouse
instead
of
a
tripel
this
is
on
the
whole
not
bad
with
some
good
characteristics
though
not
the
best
that
new
holland
brews
still
worth
trying
appearance
a
bit
lame
no
head
no
lacing
the
beer
may
have
been
too
cold
smells
of
heavy
vanilla
and
butterscotch
a
nice
golden
color
very
clean
beer
medium
bodied
fairly
hoppy
for
a
tripel
tastes
of
mega
vanilla
and
toasted
almonds
a
bit
strange
twingy
aftertaste
a
very
strong
brew
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
dryish
finish
a
nice
american
version
of
this
belgian
beer
i
did
enjoy
it
overall
a
mediocre
tripel
just
too
sweet
and
heavy
drinkability
is
moderate
flavors
are
good
and
beer
goes
down
smooth
but
a
bomber
is
plenty
good
beer
this
could
be
my
goto
belgian
style
tripel
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
d
gets
better
as
the
glass
empties
far
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
and
far
better
offerings
from
this
brewery
this
beer
was
a
hazy
dark
gold
with
a
tight
offwhite
cap
of
fine
bubbles
good
head
retention
with
lots
of
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
full
of
floral
and
spicy
hops
a
little
lemony
too
with
bready
sweet
malt
and
mild
fruitiness
the
flavour
was
dominated
by
malty
caramel
and
sugary
sweetness
it
had
a
sharp
alcohol
and
bitter
flavour
that
didnt
work
well
the
notes
of
grainy
malt
and
fruity
esters
were
nice
though
medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
and
light
warmth
other
than
weird
things
going
on
in
the
flavour
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
think
that
this
is
a
great
new
holland
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
with
plenty
of
taste
and
slightly
dangerous
as
i
could
drink
more
and
more
of
this
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
fruity
and
sweet
but
bitter
and
very
american
i
like
the
take
on
the
style
pours
a
translucent
golden
color
with
a
shortlived
white
head
aroma
is
mostly
malty
and
candi
sugar
sweet
with
notes
of
white
nectarine
tangerine
and
hints
of
alcohol
taste
is
mostly
sweet
with
notes
of
fusel
alcohols
froot
looplike
fruitiness
and
and
almost
lagerish
finish
rather
boring
and
onedimensional
lacking
any
depth
or
complexity
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
with
a
decent
carbonation
level
overall
its
not
the
worst
u
s
brewed
tripel
just
nothing
really
noteworthy
maybe
id
try
it
again
if
i
found
it
ondraught
otherwise
ill
pass
bottle
courtesy
of
ss
poured
a
clear
and
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
big
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
as
well
aroma
of
light
peach
with
some
sweet
malt
and
light
spice
mix
in
the
background
taste
is
also
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
light
peaches
sweet
malt
and
light
spices
maybe
some
pepper
and
a
yeasty
finish
body
is
about
average
for
the
style
with
some
great
carbonation
texture
is
not
oily
nor
is
sweetness
cloying
which
was
well
appreciated
i
thought
this
was
very
well
done
and
probably
underrated
imo
black
tulip
tripel
was
pretty
in
two
snifters
i
poured
it
into
very
clear
golden
lagerlike
coloring
with
a
slight
hint
of
orange
red
creamy
head
looked
great
from
the
start
but
faded
quickly
maintaining
a
presence
just
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
throughout
consumption
black
tulip
had
a
clean
nose
but
with
some
citrus
and
tangerine
plus
flowery
hop
aromas
first
sip
very
full
sweet
body
with
citrus
and
tangerine
persisting
and
some
pleasant
hops
to
round
it
out
at
the
end
these
characteristics
were
pretty
much
consistent
for
the
whole
glass
though
the
hop
presence
faded
a
bit
my
main
complaint
would
be
that
it
seemed
to
lack
a
bit
of
complexity
and
didnt
change
much
as
i
drank
it
did
taste
good
with
those
buffalo
steaks
though
it
poured
very
clear
and
i
was
really
suprised
by
this
it
had
a
great
pale
golden
color
and
when
under
the
nose
had
a
great
sweet
charactor
to
it
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
felt
very
smooth
in
texture
i
was
most
suprised
with
the
clarity
of
the
beer
as
it
was
not
cloudy
in
any
way
also
it
had
a
great
sweet
tasting
head
to
it
that
added
abit
of
flavor
of
its
own
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
color
with
an
orange
hue
and
a
thin
white
head
that
disappears
really
quickly
some
lacing
shown
the
smell
is
reserved
but
recognizable
coriander
spice
sweet
malt
and
belgian
yeast
the
body
is
a
little
heavier
than
ive
experienced
before
with
this
style
this
one
is
slightly
undercarbonated
but
the
mouth
feel
is
complemented
by
the
complexity
achieved
with
the
coriander
spice
and
almost
syrupy
sweet
flavors
instead
of
being
dry
this
ones
sweetness
lingers
some
i
like
this
a
lot
but
i
can
say
that
its
on
the
edge
of
style
hey
drink
whats
right
for
you
mr
bryson
your
point
about
style
guides
applies
once
again
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
though
enjoy
d
the
tripel
fails
to
settle
into
a
groove
remaining
incredibly
sweet
throughout
drinkable
but
unspectacular
d
nice
example
of
a
triple
high
alcohol
catches
up
to
you
but
its
hidden
well
by
the
sweet
fruitiness
overall
very
fun
to
drink
refreshing
but
with
some
real
character
and
body
will
keep
this
in
mind
as
a
favorite
eric
d
would
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
excellent
trippel
with
a
light
golden
color
that
shimmers
in
the
glass
and
a
clean
white
head
on
top
the
head
fell
after
a
bit
and
left
a
spotty
lace
around
the
side
nice
nose
with
the
light
hop
smell
and
a
bit
of
yeast
clean
crisp
beer
with
a
lot
of
peppery
notes
in
the
taste
actually
stronger
than
the
hop
easy
drinking
and
a
very
elegant
well
done
beer
if
youre
not
into
the
pepper
i
can
see

the
body
is
good
with
a
light
carbonation
that
could
be
improved
a
dry
finish
and
as
mention
very
smooth
with
no
solvent
or
phenolics
off
setting
this
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
would
say
it
is
not
a
tripel
in
taste
but
still
very
surprising
9
is
a
little
masking
of
its
character
this
is
my
first
forray
into
the
trippels
since
they
became
available
here
in
sc
will
definitely
explore
this
genre
a
great
introduction
on
the
darker
side
of
being
golden
nice

the

thing
going

wonderful
flavora
tad
sweeter
then
i
am
used
to
in
a
trippel
very
very
malty
with
a
thick
candi
sugar
flavor
nice
low
level
ester
flavor
a
bit
too
sweet
keeps
me
from
giving
it
higher
marks
nice
mouthfeel
but
needs
to
dry
out
some
more
very
very
drinkable
beer
overallextremely
tasty
if
it
lost
some
of
the
sweetness
it
could
be
top
notch
its
creamy
mouthfeel
hides
the
9
no
heat
detectable
actually
thanks
to
some
robust
sweetness
sweet
and
spicy
i
would
say
with
some
of
the
latter
coming
from
hops
with
a
little
to
much
emphasis
on
the
sweet
hop
flavors
are
significant
actually
with
some
lemon
zing
coming
from
there
they
grow
with
time
the
malt
does
boast
a
slightly
caramelized
character
but
its
minimal
overall
a
rock
solid
trippel
and
my
favorite
offering
from
new
holland
that
i
have
sampled
thus
far
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
fruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
rich
and
fruity
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
some
banana
esters
and
a
residual
candy
sugar
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
with
loads
of
flavor
its
not
my
favorite
trippel
but
its
got
excellent
character
and
drinkability
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
creamylooking
head
smell
is
sweet
with
belgian
sugar
but
at
the
same
time
has
a
nice
hop
presence
slightly
citrusypiney
being
a
tripel
i
expected
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
this
was
definitely
the
case
the
taste
does
do
a
pretty
good
job
of
covering
the
alcohol
until
the
very
end
it
starts
out
much
like
the
smell
sweet
with
belgian
sugar
and
a
bit
of
spice
transitioning
to
the
hop
presence
and
finishes
very
dry
and
with
a
definite
strong
alcohol
bite
after
a
few
drinks
into
the
beer
the
alcohol
presence
isnt
as
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
in
body
but
it
has
a
dense
carbonation
that
makes
the
beer
feel
heavier
drinks
like
a
light
beer
with
awesome
taste
i
have
to
say
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
especially
after
trying
their
blue
goat
which
i
thought
wasnt
very
impressive
at
all
really
nice
american
take
tripels
are
not
my
favorite
belgian
style
but
among
tripels
this
is
a
very
good
one
that
i
have
to
compare
facetoface
with
the
belgian
counterparts
the
price
here
is
obviously
better
overall
not
bad
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
either
it
left
a
a
lingering
taste
in
my
mouth
like
a
cough
drop
would
there
are
belgian
wannabe
tripels
and
there
are
just
american
tripels
that
dont
try
to
copy
the
belgians
and
just
do
their
own
things
well
this
is
the
latter
very
tasty
with
a
melange
of
flavors
a
little
aging
might
mellow
the
hops
and
mild
alcohol
burn
but
other
than
that
a
great
beer
all
in
all
a
nice
beer
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
from
what
ive
had
id
like
to
try
some
more
of
the
stuff
from
new
holland
this
may
not
be
the
greatest
triple
out
there
but
it
is
a
damn
fine
american
attempt
at
one
i
dont
know
its
ok
and
it
is
drinkable
i
just
needed
to
get
over
the
mix
of
flavors
that
to
me
are
not
in
tune
with
a
true
belgian
triple
a
nice
offering
from
new
holland
but
id
rather
a
huyghe
hazy
golden
bubbly
thin
off
white
head
lace
is
quite
full
aroma
is
very
sweet
too
sweet
fruity
as
well
a
little
estery
im
glad
the
sweetness
isnt
a
problem
on
the
palate
its
sweet
but
not
overly
so
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
quite
estery
with
bananas
and
pears
the
biggies
candy
like
sweetness
is
present
yeastiness
is
evident
through
the
esters
could
use
a
little
doughiness
but
nonetheless
this
is
still
decent
light
carbonation
and
lightly
carbonated
pretty
clean
finish
for
9
0
the
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
a
bit
suprised
by
this
one
poured
from
a
22oz
into
a
pint
glass
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
darker
pale
gold
nice
solid
head
leaving
heavy
lacing
the
smell
is
very
sweet
almost
honey
not
so
much
fruity
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
strong
hop
flavor
from
this
beer
it
is
not
all
hop
by
any
strech
of
the
imagination
but
i
think
they
may
be
too
strong
for
the
style
almost
grassy
very
smooth
no
alcohol
tinge
at
all
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
though
would
buy
again
overall
i
really
like
funk
and
this
beer
is
the
funkiest
why
its
called
a
trippel
i
dont
understand
but
whatever
the
brewery
calls
it
i
call
for
more
of
it
thanks
again
to
shbobdb
for
this
terrific
oddity
i
want
more
of
this
drinkabilityoverall
a
nice
middleoftheroad
american
tripel
never
oversteps
its
bounds
but
not
quite
a
standout
on
any
front
the
flavor
is
citrus
and
lemony
with
the
black
pepper
and
spice
it
is
a
bit
herbal
and
yeasty
too
it
is
medium
in
body
and
smooth
drinking
for
its
strength
this
one
finishes
out
dry
a
nice
enjoyable
tripel
a
nice
intro
to
new
holland
ill
have
another
please
drinkability
doesnt
have
the
trippel
bigness
but
is
pretty
tasty
otherwise
new
holland
is
now
distributing
in
minnesota
so
i
picked
up
this
offering
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
its
not
as
hot
as
golden
monkey
and
not
as
expensive
as
some
of
the
better
belgians
so
i
could
see
getting
this
again
as
a
change
of
pace
pours
like
a
big
3
brew
with
a
yellow
golden
body
and
a
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
little
lace
on
the
glass
nose
screams
of
soured
raw
wheat
and
mineral
water
enters
the
mouth
with
almost
an
oily
syrup
like
mouth
painting
feel
nice
balance
of
hopes
and
raw
wheat
this
is
a
very
complex
brew
that
shines
with
individuality
style
even
yeilds
resemblance
to
a
german
style
enjoyable
and
unique
mouthfeel
thickens
on
the
buds
and
makes
you
want
more
very
drinkable
but
keep
it
colder
judging
from
the
rating
averages
i
didnt
expect
this
to
be
a
very
good
beer
but
it
is
of
course
it
is
a
typical
american
response
to
a
classic
belgian
style
so
there
is
some
give
but
it
did
have
a
handsome
straw
heavily
carbonated
wellheaded
appearance
fruity
esters
abound
in
the
nose
and
flavors
lightly
peppery
spicy
and
alcoholicly
hot
but
tempered
with
pilner
malts
fruity
sweetness
and
a
dull
hop
flavor
mildly
tart
and
thinning
into
the
finish
leaving
a
dry
alcoholic
vaporation
on
the
toung
perhaps
a
bit
grainy
and
astringent
in
the
end
but
a
pretty
good
beer
throughout
i
split
the
bottle
with
a
buddy
i
drank
all
of
mine
thought
by
the
time
it
got
to
the
end
it
was
warm
and
almost
medicinal

kind

this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
am
glad
to
find
another
brewery
that
matches
flavor
and
availability
this
brew
pours
a
semi
cloudy
pale
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
into
sparce
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
nice
yeasty
tones
and
a
lot
of
oranges
perhaps
too
much
orange
the
taste
is
metallic
and
the
aftertaste
is
more
so
the
mouthfeel
seems
about
right
for
a
tripel
but
nothing
special
overall
this
beer
was
a
hard
one
to
finish
and
at
6

a
bottle
i
certainly
will
not
but
it
again
tis
no

drinkability
a

beer
a
surefire
sipper
worth
a
shot
i
would
go
back
to
enjoy
more
of
this
underrated
belgian
fresh
from
my
recent
trip
to
michigan
this
750
went
down
very
well
with
its
malting
on
a
hot
day
with
good
yeastiness
and
hops
showing
their
bitterness
in
the
finish
subtle
yeast
spiciness
mild
citrus
good
medium
plus
mouthfeel
drinkability
pretty
strong
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
last
fall
and
it
has
aged
quite
well
i
could
easily
end
up
sleeping
on
the
floor
with
too
many
of
these
mouthfeel
is
chewier
than
i
expected
and
perhaps
a
little
overly
carbonated
for
my
liking
fortunatley
its
not
overly
carbonated
enough
to
impact
drinkability
its
a
good
beer
and
way
underrated
a
wickedly
easy
to
drink
beer
that
could
certainly
get
you
in
trouble
with
its
kick
i
only
regret
that
i
do
not
have
more
of
this
a
beer
that
i
can
recommend
wholeheartedly
at
first
this
didnt
blow
me
away
but
the
more
i
sit
here
and
sip
it
the
more
i
appreciate
its
excellent
subtle
touches
very
good
d
damn
it
is
about
time
i
had
an
other
american
brewed
tripel
that
rivals
belgian
brewed
triples
ill
have
to
save
my
other
bottle
and
pit
this
one
against
westmalle
next
time
very
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
jen
i
may
not
be
wowed
by
this
trippel
but
it
is
what
i
would
expect
it
smells
of
sweet
candied
malts
and
the
flavor
dictates
the
same
i
get
a
nice
smooth
taste
of
sweet
candy
followed
by
bananas
and
a
light
clovepeppery
mild
bite
it
ends
with
a
mild
citrus
hop
flavor
with
a
kick
of
alcohol
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
the
flavors
are
done
nicely
not
too
overwhelming
d
in
the
vast
array
of
tripels
available
this
one
falls
among
the
mediocre
its
drinkable
as
in
im
not
going
to
pour
it
down
the

its

i

at

just
not
your
typical
tripel
i
would
buy
again
but
wouldnt
drink
if
i
was
jonesing
for
a
tripel
triples
are
too
much
for
me
one
of
the
better
american
tripels
ive
had
right
up
there
with
allagash
very
interesting
beer
almost
a
hybrid
beer
with
95
tripel
with
an
inventive
infusion
of
hops
to
add
a
new
dimension
to
the
tripel
style
this
viscous
brew
coats
the
palate
with
a
wide
spectrum
of
flavors
as
others
here
have
described
the
brewers
at
flying
fish
have
definitely
created
a
dynamic
beer
that
is
outside
of
the
box
and
is
a
great
brew
to
drink
slowly
and
enjoy
was
close
to
drain
pouring
this
on
first
taste
but
it
got
a
good
bit
better
as
it
warmed
lots
of
citrus
hops
and
alcohol
the
biggest
problem
with
this
beer
is
the
alcohol
actually
is
stronger
than
the
9
5
percent
that
it
checks
in
at
beautiful
clear
golden
color
moderate
carb
and
a
little
white
frothy
head
smells
of
beligiany
yeast
kind
of
like
a
saision
with
the
appleclementinecoriander
and
behind
all
that
a
sweet
sugary
candy
sweetness
pokes
through
maybe
a
little
bit
of
artificial
banana
type
scent
too
wow
this
is
tasty
not
a
very
big
hop
presence
at
all
a
touch
of
bitterness
not
even
kind
of
sweet
crisp
towards
the
end
a
boozy
kick
comes
in
but
is
knocked
out
quick
by
sweetness
making
this
beer
quite
drinkable
for
a
9
5
mouthfeel
is
very
lightsmooth
medium
amount
of
carbonation
tasty
and
im
not
a
big
triple
guy
overall
a
super
drinkable
beer
with
some
saison
characteristics
mainly
in
the
nose
pick
this
one
up
give
it
a
try
looks
like
most
light
beers
smells
like
the
real
deal
and
will
knock
you
down
like
a
left
hook
from
joe
frazier
or
make
you
try
to
sing
like
frank
sinatra
if
he
still
lived
in
hoboken
toxic
state
for
the
price
that
i
got
it
in
ca
it
was
worth
every
oz
jersey
aint
known
for
its
clean
water
so
this
is
a
the
best
option
for
drinking
beer
in
nj
have
a
few
before
you
take
that
canoe
trip
down
the
awesome
delaware
river
hope
you
can
swim
good
though
ooverall
a
nice
tripel
with
a

has
everything
a

should
and
more
just
a
little
bit
more
acidic
than
i
like
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
seems
a
little
odd
for
a
tripel
less
pilsner
character
less
alcohol
heat
less
big
flavors
than
expected
for
the
listed
style
it
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
to
me
this
bottle
didnt
seem
to
have
much
in
the
way
of
the
promised
hoppiness
but
theres
no
freshness
information
on
the
bottle
either
still
a
tasty
beer
if
nothing
outstanding
o
tough
to
rate
this
one
since
it
is
much
hoppier
than
any
other
tripel
ived
tried
the
tastes
are
pretty
good
and
the
alcohol
is
not
too
well
hidden
at

thats
not
a
big
surprise
overall
im
happy

tried
it

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty

slightly
boozy
o
exit
4
is
the
epitome
of
a
blend
between
a
belgian
trippel
and
an
american
ipa
being
that
these
are
my
two
of
my
top
three
beer
styles
exit
4
ranks
as
one
of
my
top
beers
of
all
time
and
for
it
to
be
a
yearround
offering
makes
me
smile
i
am
never
without
less
than
a
6pack
and
more
like
a
case
at
any
given
time
the
ability
to
harness
the
profile
of
a
belgian

and
combine
it
with
the

from
pacific
northwest

makes
it
one
outstanding

exit

is
one
among
many
reason
to
rejoice
being
born

raised
in

get
it
if

overall
this

triple
very

worth
trying
i
may
even
get
it
again
o
its
great
but
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
its
not
that
complex
like
drinking
orange
pineapple

almost
exactly
overall
a
decent
trippel
little
light

o
good
not
great
like
i
said
i
started
this
at
room
temperature
the
sweetness
and
fruitiness
is
nice
but
i
would
have
like
a
little
more
of
a
wheatybanana
flavor
in
here
oh
well
also
a
little
less
alcohol
in
the
flavor
would
have
been
nice
though
was
room
temp
overall
all
though
i
would
give
this
a
thumbs
up
though
i
feel
there
are
better
representations
of
the
style
exit

is
an
american
craft
tripel
nice
construction
very
pretty
pour
definite
citrus
taste
and
aftertaste
moderate
carbonation
for
the
abv
without
echoing
much
of
what
has
already
been
said
this
beer
is
well
worth
buying
flying

appears
to
be
a
fine
brewery
i
must
hole
back
from
the
comparisons
to
belgian
tripelsthey
brought
it
up
on
their
label
but
as
a
warm
afternoon
enjoyment
beverage
this
one
works
for
me
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
small
white
head

sweet
spicy
fruity
notes
citrus

some

tangy

some

ending
has
some
zesty
mild
hops
bitterness
for
balance
a
nicely
balanced
flavorful
and
enjoyable
drinking
brew
not
too
shabby
a
triple
definitely
american
in
style
with
its
bready
sweetness
dominating
things
a
bit
thick
feel
is
fairly
smooth
mildly
biting
carbonation
a
pretty
pleasant
tripel
things
seem
to
be
looking
up
at
flying

as
of
late
i
can
suggest
this
one
exit

pours
a

well

a
very
tasty
fruity
and
full
bodied
tripel
as
ive
already
said
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
tripel
to
me
at
all
but
they
do
call
it
an

im
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
night
because
the
alcohol
will
catch
up
with
you
and
the
thickness
could
make
it
start
seeming

cloying

this
is
quite

and
its

and
makes
it
somewhat
easy
to
drink
i
think
if
they
took
the

down
a
percent
and
added
slightly

and
probably
their

work

overall
maybe
the
bigger
alcohol
profile
makes
it
stay
in
the
trippel
camp
regardless
but
the
nose
had
a

going

some
of

this

try
at
a
trippel
style
beer
usually
you
cant
find
a
6er
at
this
abv
but
id
almost
call
it
a
belgian
ipa
rather
than
a
tripelthe
bottle
even
advertises
its
relative
hoppiness
compared
to
other
tripels
i
might
rate
it
slightly
higher
as
a

as

highly

immediately
find
myself
battling
a
bias
against
this
beer
for
calling
itself
an
american
tripel
quite
a
nice
beer
nice
tripel
underpinnings
with
a
huge
hop
prsence
on
top
an
american
tripel
according
to
the
label
pours
golden
with
a
glow
to
it
and
a
fairly
nice
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
swirly
cap
smells
of
nice
citrusy
hops
with
a
zing
of
pine
tossed
in
and
a
sweet
malt
and
estery
base
with
further
fruit
smells

fairly
dry

nicely
balanced
in
the
mouth
honeyed
malt
nice
belgian
yeasty
notes
with
some
banana

as
well
as
some
plum
some
wax
and
quite
a
nice
citrusy
hop
presence
with
nice
red
grapefruit
and
orange
flavors
im
really
enjoying
this
there
is
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
not
super
sweet
which
i
like
and
the
hops
help
balance
everything
the
citrus
flavors
are
great
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
id
drink
this
again
and
again
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
bottle
poured
a
deep
gold
somewhat
hazy
big
fruity
nose
with
a
nice
hop
presence
and
a
strange
round
note
very
lively
and
effervescent
in
the
mouth
big
orange
banana
some
butterscotch
maybe
tropical
fruits
despite
all
these
fruit
sugars
it
finishes
extremely
dry
and
short
which
was
awesome
champagne
like
at
times
excellent
d
a
delicious
brew
pour
me
another
drinkability
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
not
completely
as
the
alcohol
burn
is
still
there
but
very
drinkable
non
the
less
drinkability
i
dont
dislike
it
at
all
but
im
not
in
love
i
dont
think
this
hop
bill
is
quite
right
too
assertive
i
do
like
a
hoppy
tripel
see
la
chouffe
but
this
aint
quite
right
drinkability
reminiscent
of
green
flashs
le
freak
leaves
you
navigating
the
loosely
traditional
aspects
and
the
sharp
american
hops
like
a
beerbased
magellan
as
a
classic
tripel
it
fails
though
perhaps
it
would
be
better
suited
touting
itself
as
an
americanborn

deep

excellent

phenols
in

id
like
from

to
speak
of
but
a
low

aroma
comes
through
flavor
is
similar
to
aroma
although
a

flavor
supports
the

is
low
as
expected
for
a
trippel
very
interesting
blend
of

tropical

medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
id
expect
more
fizz
in
this

warmth
an
intriguing
blend
of
american

and
belgian

drinkable
although

of
flavors
and
alcohol
would
limit
my
daily
intake
of
this
beer
drinkability
as
confusing
as
a
spaghetti
junction
on
the
new
jersey
turnpike
i
dont
think
the
concept
of
an
american
tripel
or
trippel
works
very
well
as
the
combination
of
pithy
hops
and
yeasty
phenols
just
doesnt
make
for
a
particularly
enjoyable
combination
an
interesting
experiment
and
obviously
others
disagree
otherwise
this
beer
would
never
have
been
rereleased
in
12
oz
bottles
i
wish
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
more
but
overall
it
was
very
nice
medium
bodied
and
flavored
poured
out
a
nice
dark
gold
hazy
beer
moderately
carbonated
smells
of
banana
alcohol
esters
a
semi
sweet
beer
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
so
so
very
drinkable
for
a
tripel
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
could
totally
sneak
up
on
you
d
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
ff
nice
unique
brew
with
excellent
drinkability
for
its
strength
drinkability
fantastic
brew
their
best
beer
that
i
have
had
poured
from
750ml
bottle
a
little
darker
in
color
than
most
tripels
apricot
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
that
had
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
i
slightly
fruity
with
hints
of
tropical
fruit
and
white
grapes
faint
hints
of
spice
such
as
cloves
alcohol
is
very
evident
in
the
nose
the
flavor
seems
to
be
a
bit
sloppy
alcohol
just
dominates
the
palate
if
that
was
not
bad
enough
this
beer
is
also
very
dry
and
has
a
bitter
finish
hard
to
pick
out
any
of
the
belgian
qualities
sort
of
tastes
like
cheap
high
abv
wine
i
think
i
am
being
generous
giving
this
a
2
5
in
taste
the
body
is
on
par
for
the
style
and
is
nicely
carbonated
bottle
conditioning
worked
its
magic
here
not
an
enjoyable
beer
and
aging
will
do
little
to
improve
this
beer
not
impressed
with
my
first
flying
fish
limited
series
beer
unfortunately
im
not
really
impressed
with
this
beer
it
tasted
more
like
a
pale
ale
mixed
with
vodka
and
some
spice
its
not
a
terrible
beer
i
just
dont
really
think
this
lives
up
to
my
expectations
im
sorry
flying
fish
i
know
you
said
it
would
be
an
american
tripel
but
im
just
not
biting
d
not
a
great
beer
wouldnt
look
to
have
again
not
bad
but
not
balanced
imo
they
just
missed
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
below
average
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
to
it
a
lot
of
flavors
came
through
and
none
of
them
were
overpowering
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
for
tha
abv
as
well
drinkability
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
chore
classic
tripel
flavors
were
muted
hop
presence
was
overkill
and
the
alcohol
presence
was
difficult
to
look
over
your
mileage
may
vary
but
ill
be
avoiding
this
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
note
this
is
my
first
review
on
ba
and
am
still
working
on
training
my
palette
body
is
full
and
a
little
syrupy
without
much
carbonation
not
how
i
really
like
for
a
tripel
to
be
but
not
wholly
unpleasant
this
is
maybe
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
consumed
while
its
pretty
fresh
nice
flavor
but
i
think
its
a
bit
faded
and
the
body
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
it
looks
like
flying
fish
has
decided
that
exit
4
is
good
enough
to
be
released
in
six
packs
heres
hoping
they
performed
a
major
overhaul
because
the
beer
that
im
drinking
right
now
isnt
ready
for
prime
time
even
though
it
has
a
rough
sort
of
charm
that
has
never
been
enough
where
belgianstyle
tripels
are
concerned
d
the
flavors
beg
you
to
come
back
for
more
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
tripels
but
this
one
pleased
the
palette
light
grains
hefty
alcohol
and
flavoring
hops
define
this
beer
pretty
well
hopyeastalcohol
combo
does
not
work
quite
as
well
in
the
flavor
as
it
did
on
the
nose
for
me
and
the
yeast
does
not
really
display
all
that
much
estery
personality
soft
mouthfeel
and
ample
carbonation
plenty
enjoyable
beer
but
for
me
this
falls
more
in
the
realm
of
a
belgioipa
than
a
tripel
d
i
found
this
beer
to
be
rather
disagreeable
sweet
and
sour
but
not
in
a
good
way
became
worse
at
it
warmed
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
pretty
american
not
really
a
tripel
thanks
russ
dave
one
of
the
best
trippel
style
ales
i
have
had
outside
of
belgium
or
canada
m
d
its
getting
a
little
heavy
but
id
still
consider
it
a
medium
body
or
maybe
medium
but
chewy
the
alcohol
content
is
masked
remarkably
and
outside
of
the
modest
peppery
notes
and
a
generally
smooth
warming
theres
not
much
more
to
suggest
it
as
being
quite
so
strong
its
quite
a
nice
take
on
the
style
being
one
that
i
find
myself
often
quite
picky
about
id
look
forward
to
this
brew
again
the
next
time
i
came
up
d
overall
tasty
and
quit
drinkable
the
solventy
edge
on
the
palate
is
enough
to
indicate
the
abv
but
it
doesnt
hinder
drinkability
at
all
a
couple
of
these
and
youll
be
feeling
good
this
beer
is
something
else
it
poured
honey
colored
with
a
thick
white
head
that
quickly
dissolved
the
smell
is
sort
of
like
cherry
though
a
little
to
thin
to
completely
discern
taste
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
hopps
and
malts
which
finishes
with
a
bitter
sweet
taste
this
along
with
the
smooth
bubbly
feel
makes
for
one
very
drinkable
beer
d
perhaps
my
favorite
pour
of
the
festival
no
notable
flaws
has
a
distinctly
unbelgian
hoppiness
seeming
closer
to
the
belgian
ipa
rather
than
the
tripel
no
worries
though
this
is
a
special
beer
and
one
id
love
to
have
again
well
done
flying
fish
a
good
beer
i
found
these
in
a
sixer
so
ive
enjoyed
all
of
them
including
the
last
one
this
one
these
guys
are
local
so
i
love
to
support
them
in
any
way
another
good
one
from
flying
fish
drinkability
is
good
fairly
well
balanced
a
nice
beer
but
really
not
a
tripel
the
malt
and
hop
profile
is
very
american
maybe
a
bit
of
belgian
yeasty
character
but
not
much
still
they
call
it
an
american
tripel
so
i
dont
know
how
close
this
one
is
to
the
actual
exit
and
what
seems
like
a
decent
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
body
tends
toward
the
lighter
end
of
medium
and
mild
hop
finish
im
glad
that
americans
can
brew
a
pretty
damn
good
tripel
it
was
quite
an
intresting
take
on
the
style
that
drank
well
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
it
gobzillajun

but
i
really
like
this
beer
along
the
same
lines
as
stones
calibelgique
and
flying

an
impressive
cap
of

am
glad
that
this
beer
is
labeled
as

than
a
true
tripel
exit

is
a
nice
hoppy
take
on
a
classic
belgian
style
daseneblerapr

but
has
a
nice
sharp
bitter
finish
with
the
hops
that
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
took
me
a
while
to
get
used
to
that
please
please
please
make
11
and
16
year
around
they
are
amazingrguardian989mar

will
give
it
a
2nd
chance
to
see
if
it
was
an
off
day
for
me
or
the
beer
al3mar
03
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
trippels
it
left
a
nice
coating
in
my
mouth
a
really
fine
brew
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
thus
far
its
my
least
favorite
of
the
3
exit
beers
but
that
should
really
indicate
how
good
the
other
2
and
flying
fishs
operation
as
a
whole
is
d
great
tripel
in
my
mind
lovely
the
whole
way
over
great
dry
finish
poured
ito
a
weisse
glass
golden
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
head
very
fruity
and
spicy
not
a
bad
triple
but
there
are
better
i
do
however
want
to
support
this
series
love
the
concept
and
exit
4
was
my
childhood
exit
a
decent
beer
and
cant
wait
for
other
exits
bonus
is
this
series
has
really
pissed
off
the
turnpike
overall
not
your
traditional
triple
by
any
means
but
very
solid
none
the
less
i
would
have
no
issue
with
going
after
this
one
again
one
day
very
solid
overall
an
average
beer
with
very
low
drinkability
due
to
the
combo
of
fusel
alcohol
and
hop
bitterness
being
overpowering
and
unenjoyable
as
the
beer
is
consumed
so
ill
lie
here
in
my
easy
chair
and
dream
dream
of
better
times
and
try
to
forget
that
i
must
wake
to
row
again
in
the
morning
d
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
not
the
best
trippel
but
definately
better
than
most
of
the
other
ff
beers
that
ive
tried
exit
4
is
good
but
could
be
better
with
a
more
solid
yeast
strain
i
feel
like
hmm
a
fine
effort
though
and
from
jersey
drinkability
no
way
can
i
compare
this
with
a
st
bernardus
tripel
tripel
karmeliet
or
a
westmalle
tripel
in
my
opinion
this
doesnt
fit
the
tripel
class
no
bjcp
guidelines
for
this
offering
to
me
you
add
an
arse
load
of
hops
to
a
tripel
style
and
you
get
this
beer
the
beers
overall
ease
of
consumption
is
there
as
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
throughout
good
density

this
beer

but
this
one
does
not
make
it
out
of
the
middle
of
the
road
some
phenolic
tendencies
but
not
enough
some
hoppy
feel
but
not
enough
all
in
all
a
decent
tasting
brew
but
ends
up
being
a
lower
level
american
tripel
compared
to
the
all
stars
of
the
style

into

glass
nice

and

mildly
carbonated
you
could
definitely
pick
up
hints

the
alcohol
content
in
the

fortunately
you
also
pick
up
a
pungent

aroma
most

also

up
some

the

was

and
a
stronger
than
expected
alcoholic
feel
in
the
finish
despite
the
slight
burn
the

bouquet
and
medium
feel
make
this
a
decent
session
beer
at
least
before
the
abv
knocks
you
out
well
done
ff
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
tripel
especially
since
it
utilized
lots
of
american
hops
giving
it
a
sweet
fruity
twist
medium
bodied
with
low
medium
carbonation
and
a
soft
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
tastes
just
are
not
doing
it
for
me
so
despite
hiding
the
abv
well
this
isnt
all
that
drinkable
for
me
whether
as
per
style
or
not
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
though
drinkability
its
actually
a
pretty
nice
balanced
beer
good
mix
of
the
belgian
style
and
the
more
american
bitter
hops
overall
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
and
a
unique
beer
worth
a
shot
best
beer
so
far
by
far
of
the
flying
fish
line
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
my
first
from
flying
fish
brewing
company
id
probably
give
them
another
shot
based
on
this
dont
drink
and
review
i
really
did
enjoy
this
again
appearance
looked
a
little
funny
at
first
looked
like
a
fine
champagne
but
as
you
sip
on
it
it
turns
to
a
fine
wine
as
the
carbonation
disappears
good
beer
but
out
of
the
classic
style
i
like
it
but
it
wouldnt
be
on
my
top
5
list
for
tripels
if
i
was
trying
to
teach
someone
about
the
style
i
think
ill
get
a
few
of
these
and
cellar
them
should
be
interesting
without
the
hops
dominating
da
nice
fusion
brew
good
stuff
even
if
it
is
a
bit
unbalanced
and
a
touch
too
spicy
a
decent
beer
for
the
first
beer
in
the
newly
released
exit
series
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
them
certainly
an
american
interpretation
of
the
style
it
has
an
american
hop
touch
that
works
well
here
nicely
balanced
unique
an
interesting
sipper
in
terms
of
this
being
an
american
tripel
i
would
say
that
this
is
even
more
of
a
hybrid
than
the
label
advertises
its
definitely
an
americanbelgian
in
that
the
brewers
used
a
belgian
yeast
strain
and
hopped
the
wort
more
heavily
than
a
continental
brewer
would
have
but
theres
a
slight
sourness
to
the
beer
here
that
i
dont
normally
come
to
expect
with
tripels
the
sweetness
is
downplayed
though
you
can
taste
golden
malts
and
honey
d
it
is
good
but
nothing
remarkable
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
say
at
this
point
to
hold
on
to
this
one
for
a
while
to
see
where
it
goes
i
think
it
needs
a
little
bit
more
time
right
now
the
hops
are
not
even
fresh
so
you
are
not
going
to
loose
that
aspect
of
it
overall
decent
overall
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
again
hopefully
the
exit
series
gets
better
sorry
d
definitely
a
must
try
for
those
that
havent
being
a
jersey
boy
i
always
root
for
the
home
team
and
flying
fish
has
done
a
great
job
with
exit
4
cant
wait
for
the
next
in
the
series
d
this
was
a
good
one
but
not
on
all
occations
it
was
a
special
evening
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
am
looking
forward
to
more
exit
series
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
beer
i
love
the
hoppy
tripels
and
this
one
did
not
let
me
down
the
only
downside
is
how
pricey
it
is
but
beyond
that
this
beer
is
excellent
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
worthwhile
brew
and
one
im
enjoying
a
lot
i
think
a
couple
of
glasses
a
night
is
more
than
enough
with
this
abv
level
but
im
definitely
looking
forward
to
the
other
bottles
ive
got
waiting
for
me
over
the
next
few
months
i
have
the
distinct
feeling
that
there
is
complexity
here
that
will
emerge
more
clearly
with
a
bit
more
bottle
age
i
also
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
get
some
chouffe
houblon
dobbelen
belgian
ipa
and
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
with
this
flying
fish
exit
4
american
trippel
d
a
very
nice
bottle
conditioned
tripel
by
an
american
brewer
i
would
buy
another
and
let
it
sit
a
while
pours
a
orange
yellow
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
entire
glass
leaving
lots
of
soapy
lace
fruity
nose
grapes
peach
citrus
apricot
bready
pretzel
dough
yeast
soft
proactive
spice
and
generous
amounts
of
hops
medium
bodied
fruity
with
a
very
apparent
abv
a
quick
sipper
indeed
very
well
done
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
series
notes
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
with
the
seeds
they
have
it
certainly
feels
like
they
could
have
grown
something
better
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
flying
fish
but
it
is
nice
to
see
them
stepping
out
of
the
box
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
was
quite
a
surprise
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
enjoyed
it
for
sure
i
do
wish
that
the
beer
had
bettering
melding
of
the
american
and
the
tripel
components
in
fact
there
isnt
much
tripel
here
at
all
i
was
expecting
something
with
more
sweetness
makes
me
proud
to
be
from
cherry
hill
i
appreciated
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
the
tripelwithhops
did
have
some
nice
qualities
to
ithalfway
through
the
bottle
the
two
pretty
bold
styles
did
seem
to
start
to
blend
rather
than
just
clash
but
ultimately
i
could
taste
the
alcohol
a
whole
lot
more
than
i
wanted
to
if
i
got
another
bottle
id
let
it
mellow
out
for
another
six
months
before
drinking
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
vast
fluffy
head
smell
is
fruity
and
apricoty
flavor
is
spicy
and
fruity
with
apricot
and
orange
with
some
slight
allspice
and
carroway
delicious
with
a
fruity
bitterness
flowery
hops
lovely
slick
mouthfeel
excellent
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
spicy
and
yeasty
with
a
bitter
smack
on
the
palate
during
the
finish
hv
flying
fish
keep
it
up
drinkability
is
going
to
take
a
bit
of
a
hit
on
this
one
im
a
big
hop
head
but
something
is
just
not
right
about
the
balance
of
this
beer
i
dont
entirely
dislike
it
it
kind
of
grows
on
you
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
i
love
the
brewery
for
pushing
the
envelope
and
i
look
forward
to
buying
the
next
release
in
the
series
with
innovation
like
this
flying
fish
is
sure
to
hit
a
huge
winner
sooner
than
later
id
sip
on
this
a
solid
brew
not
to
big
and
full
of
flavor
d
very
good
easy
going
down
and
makes
you
wish
you
bought
more
thirst
quenching
perfect
for
the
summer
day
you
can
defiantly
detect
and
respect
the
abv
mid
way
through
the
drink
bomber
flying
fish
does
my
home
state
of
nj
right
with
this
beer
and
one
you
should
seek
out
limited
release
drinkability
decent
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
young
right
now
one
bottle
is
enough
in
a
single
session
as
someone
who
enjoys
hops
im
going
to
be
more
forgiving
on
the
drinkability
its
a
good
drink
just
very
elusive
in
its
labeling
where
is
that
abv
anyway
d
what
i
expected
when
i
bought
this
brew
was
not
met
i
would
categorize
this
beer
as
being
more
in
line
with
piraat
amber
tripel
which
also
really
isnt
a
tripel
at
all
aside
from
the
alcohol
content
as
this
hophead
worked
through
this
bottle
it
got
increasingly
easy
to
drink
to
the
point
where
i
wish
i
could
have
had
another
one
the
alcohol
is
sneaky
though
i
definitely
feel
it
creeping
into
my
brain
nothing
happening
on
the
aroma
for
this
beer
on
draft
great
oneoff
one
last
thing
i
think
the
bottle
is
very
nicelooking
edit
right
there
on
the
bottle
it
says
it
will
improve
with
age
i
guess
i
shouldnt
have
been
so
quick
to
crack
it
open
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
grapefruit
and
citrus
taste
is
candied
sugarcitrus
and
alcohol
according
to
the
bottle
this
is
a
multi
year
release
to
match
the
number
of
exits
on
the
nj
turnpike
well
in
my
opinion
they
are
off
to
a
pretty
good
start
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
poured
a
deep
and
cloudy
golden
color
with
an
averaged
sized
white
head
aromas
of
floral
hops
bananas
cloves
and
other
spices
fuity
and
citrus
tastes
of
citrus
hoppy
fruity
and
some
yeastiness
lighter
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
well
done
flying
fish
and
i
look
forward
to
more
in
the
series
this
beer
is
1
in
an
series
of
18
exits
of
the
nj
turnpike
i
can
not
wait
to
see
whats
next
i
wanted
very
much
to
like
this
so
i
tried
especially
hard
to
be
utterly
and
brutally
objective
and
still
i
can
say
only
very
good
things
pretty
much
across
the
board
its
a
ballsy
american
take
on
a
classic
style
and
its
done
with
an
artful
eye
toward
blending
and
craft
the
abv
while
grandiose
does
little
to
slow
the
steady
flow
of
beer
from
the
bottle
so
im
granting
no
home
field
advantage
yet
i
say
this
is
a
damned
good
brew
with
a
boatload
of
character
and
its
brewed
in
my
backyard
im
proud
to
say
i
think
this
one
is
underrated
just
sayin
pours
clear
golden
orange
with
a
small
white
head
smells
yeasty
and
biscuity
with
spicy
hops
tastes
yeasty
with
warm
maltiness
smooth
easy
hops
on
the
end
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
finish
this
beer
does
not
get
nearly
enough
credit
for
the
tripel
ale
that
it
is
so
many
people
buy
this
beer
expecting
another
classic
victory
production
hoppy
seedy
earthy
etc
but
this
is
so
different
and
magnificent
packs
a
really
enjoyable
smooth
taste
amazing
good
carbonation
a
sour
aftertaste
definetly
golden
look
sometimes
you
can
taste
an
alcahol
aftertaste
is
the
only
downside
but
with
a
9
5
its
good
reminds
me
of
home
family
first
sip
at
union
cattle
hermosa
beach
fall
2011
with
guillermo
overall
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
was
seeking
something
with
high
alcohol
and
a
little
different
from
my
normal
ipa
or
porterstout
mood
will
definitely
leave
you
warm
and
loose
after
a
few
of
these
five
50
bar
in
las
vegas
nv
draft
nj
stirling
hotel
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
this
is
the
first
and
last
time
i
will
be
trying
a
beer
from
victory
brewing
im
sorry
but
to
be
completely
honest
i
havent
had
a
beer
quite
this
unpleasant
tasting
in
a
very
long
time
i
would
like
to
get
my
money
back
for
this
one
o
not
bad
a
decent
easy
to
find
tripel
that
is
quite
strong
and
pretty
cheap
fantastic
a
great
belgian
beer
smooth
spicy
and
very
easy
to
drink
dont
know
why
there
are
so
many
negatives
reminded
me
of
a
true
belgian
beer
horrible
taste
horrible
aftertaste
nasty
great
beer
from
victory
brew
not
a
bad
effort
by
a
brewery
far
better
known
for
its
stellar
pilsner
than
belgian
style
ales
gorgeous
golden
color
and
a
rapidly
dissipating
bright
white
one
finger
head
yeast
wafts
from
the
pour
there
is
a
dusty
musty
yeast
undertone
that
is
not
unpleasant
but
might
put
some
off
the
mouthfeel
is
also
noticeably
unlively
for
the
style
the
high
concentration
of
booze
is
virtually
unnoticeable
in
the
end
its
a
decent
attempt
and
one
that
i
would
enjoy
drinking
get
again
but
there
are
many
superior
offerings
in
this
style
elsewhere
la
fin
du
monde
and
long
strange
tripel
come
immediately
to
mind
powerful
so
watch
out
drink
carefully
winter
haven
beer
crawl
potthast
studio
solid
tripel
crisp
and
balanced
nice
golden

and
thick
white

grape
on
the
nose
yeasty
good
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
refreshing
the
9
5abv
well
covered
i
enjoyed
this
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
good
beer
i
had
a
16
of
this
at
a
birthday
party
a
few
years
back
amazing
but
forgot
to
warn
people
of
the
abv
things
got
a
little
crazy
that
night
so
drinkable
and
delicious
there
are
better
cheaper
triples
out
there
go
find
em
overall
ill
give
golden
monkey
victory
brewing
company
a
4
75
this
would
be
damned
perfect
if
the
wine
was
a
just
a
hair
more
profound
but
i
can
certainly
dig
this
even
though
im
reviewing
this
in
the
winter
this
brew
would
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
spring
or
even
summer
night
i
recommend
this
beer
and
will
pick
it
up
again
it
is
really
really
good
i
was
surprised
at
the
abv
thought
it
smooth
and
very
drinkable
that
is
all
smooth
not
too
hoppy
hint
of
spice
a
slight
taste
of
vanilla
in
first
drink
though
its
not
overwhelming
and
goes
away
after
first
drink
aftertaste
is
minimal
not
outstanding
but
worth
a
6
pack
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
with
mild
spritzy
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
is
sweet
and
on
the
drier
side
a
good
beer
that
is
middle
of
the
road
for
the
style
but
always
nice
to
have
around
since
victory
is
only
a
few
hours
from
ny
so
this
beer
is
always
fresh
and
available
another
great
beer
from
victory
very
good
triple
smooth
for
9
5
abv
pretty
smooth
nice
abv
had
this
beer
on
draft
at
the
county
grill
in
newport
news
i
liked
the
golden
color
not
much
head
nice
spicey
belgian
smell
taste
was
quite
of
a
decent
belgian
have
always
enjoyed
this
one
from
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
generally
like
victory
brews
this
one
i
did
not
i
felt
the
color
was
not
appealing
the
mouth
feel
watery
and
taste
of
bitterness
did
not
sit
well
with
me
i
am
not
sure
what
it
is
but
the
bitter
after
taste
over
powered
the
experience
of
this
brew
for
me
there
is
a
strong
banana
aroma
and
flavor
not
surprising
ina
tripel
the
spices
that
were
added
are
rather
overwhelmed
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
as
thick
as
expected
so
good
love
the
spicy
after
taste
pours
with
a
small
white
head
is
golden
in
color
and
very
murky
has
a
sweet
ale
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spice
has
a
mild
cirtus
flavor
that
balances
well
with
the
added
spices
i
had
to
give
this
a
second
chance
i
still
found
it
challenging
to
consume
maybe
good
for
you
but
not
for
me
a
basic
tripel
that
packs
a
punch
my
favorite
thing
about
it
is
that
i
can
find
victorys
golden
monkey
just
about
anywhere
which
makes
it
my
go
to
tripel
had
on
draft
pleasant
banana
notes
not
a
fan
of
the
finish
crappy
alcohol
taste
tripels
are
my
favorite
and
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
better
us
versions
fruits
herbs
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
completely
hide
the
9
5
abv
i
am
a
fan
of
all
belgium
triples
and
golden
monkey
does
not
disappoint
very
easy
to
drink
which
makes
it
hard
to
notice
the
9
5
abv
love
the
complexity
smell
taste
aftertaste
all
work
so
well
overall
not
a
bad
tripel
but
far
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
was
surprised
to
discover
that
it
is
at
least
au120
a
case
no
way
in
the
world
floral
up
front
followed
by
a
prickly
spice
and
bready
notes
with
yeasty
flavors
lots
of
warming
alcohol
on
this
one
that
takes
away
from
the
rest
of
what
this
brew
has
going
for
it
never
the
less
this
is
a
nice
sipper
on
a
cold
evening
like
tonight
cheers
im
not
sure
what
they
put
in
this
but
it
gave
me
hives
ive
never
had
an
allergic
reaction
before
the
beer
was
so
fantastic
however
that
i
finished
the
last
pint
before
having
my
girl
friend
drive
up
to
walgreens
to
get
me
some
benadryl
amazing
belgium
triple
beer
made
in
the
us
good
beer
the
first
one
is
always
a
little
sharp
on
my
tongue
but
still
enjoyable
by
far
my
favorite
beer
smoothest
tripel
and
at
over
9
abv
victory
really
hit
a
home
run
with
this
one
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
this
beer
is
great
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
drinkable
feel
there
is
a
great
warming
feel
that
helps
ease
down
and
leaves
pleasant
aftertaste
that
gives
off
a
slight
sweetness
before
dissipating
very
sweet
not
very
complex

oz
pour
into
std
pint
glass
clear
medium
gold
color
with
nice
medium
carbonation
not
much
head
retention
and
minimal
lacing
spicy
belgian
aroma
flavor
is
classic
belgian
but
with
a
finish
of
apricots
and
cinnamon
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
but
i
still
think
that
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
if
you
are
a
serious
student
of
belgian
triples
this
beer
may
disappoint
for
the
rest
of
us
it
is
a
delightful
entry
to
the
genre
and
very
enjoyable
victory
does
a
great
job
overall
just
not
that
into
this
one
love
the
combination
of
spices
usually
drink
with
indian
food
or
hot
wings
does
in
fact
pour
an
elegant
gold
well
carbonated
strong
head
that
dies
down
fairly
quickly
some
persistent
lacing
small
amount
of
sediment
medheavy
bodied
with
an
alcoholicy
backbone
no
surprise
with
and
abv
of
9

aroma
is
of
belgian
spiciness
yeasty
and
citrusy
flavor
is
that
plus
the
alchy
backbone
lingering
alchy
warmth
and
subtle
bitterness
decent
tripel
like
all
tripels
its
one
and
done
3
75
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
very
alcohol
forward
with
smell
of
rotten
apricots
would
be
better
if
it
werent
so
bitter
tripel
ale
with
added
spices
good
beer
but
im
not
a
spiced
beer
fan
bang
for
the
buck
one
of
the
best
belgians
going
very
enjoyable
dare
to
compare
a
little
spicy
nice
tripel
abv
is
up
there
at
9
5
nice
bittetness
very
tasteful
for
abv
a
little
thick
basically
an
average
triple
nothing
really
stands
out
but
is
still
decent
i
think
it
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
the
funky
flavors
tend
to
overwhelm
a
bit
would
like
to
see
more
fruit
and
pepper
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
one
does
a
decent
job
for
a
tripel
tripel
ale
with
spice
added
it
says
it
definitely
does
provide
some
spice

is
simply
not
good
enough
to
justify
grabbing
unless
your

probably
the
best
one
of
the
five
i
have
now
tried
of
theirs
and
its
not
as
if
theyve
been
feeding
me
poor
beers
up
to
this
point
this
one
is
incredibly
well
balanced
and
manages
to
hide
the
high
alcohol
very
well
with
only
a
touch
coming
through
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
this
one
is
excellent
from
start
to
finish
and
up
there
with
the
best
that
belgium
has
to
offer
flyingpigoct

it
is
a
nice
beer
tasty
and
smooth
drinking
pretty
to
look
at
and

the
malt
comes
through
but
it
doesnt
seem
much
more
than
a
single
dimension
there
is
some
bitterness
but
just
a
touch
and
some
peppery
spiciness
but
again
everything
seems
kind
of
muted
and
like
it
needs
more
some
of
the
alcohol
comes
through
in
this
one
which
i
maybe
expected
for
the
style
but
that
tied
with
the
sweetness
reducing
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
for
me
overall
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
just
so
so
maybe
a
nice
attempt
but
i
would
have
expected
better
from
this
brewer

i
realize
that
the
reason
this
beer
is
so
good
and
so
popular
is
because
it
really
hides
the
alcohol
in
a
way
that
many
other
belgians
american
or
belgianmade
dont
while
still
containing
all
the
great
characteristics
of
the
style
its
not
on
my

and

definitely
not
a

there
is

it

not
more

of

it

just
a

enough
the
only
flavor
that
turned
out
to
be
bold
was
the
spices
and
that
made
for
a
pretty
unbalanced
flavor
that
had
too
many
spices
the
price
point
was
good
but
the
more
expensive
tripels
are
much
better

i

you
get

citrus
flavor

the
beer

a

low
in

the

biscuit
malt

some
citrus
fruit
medium
belgian

and
this

didnt

so
to

and
an
amazing
complexity
ensues
the
result
is
a
beer
unlike
any
ive
had
before
the
lighter
belgian
flavors
run
nicely
against
the
bass
notes
that
emerge
from

unusual
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
warming
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
of

invites

is

love

this
is
easily
one
of
the
best

ive
ever
had
spicey
finish
with
a
gently

aftertaste
with
very
faint

it
has
a
pretty

not

very

the

was

but
has
a
thicker
more
dense

to
it
wrath
of
the

on
this
one
its
a
highly
drinkable
tripel
with
a
barely
distinguishable
abv
careful
with
this
onejaylioct
07
although
not
a
bad
effort
it
doesnt
really
stand
up
compared
to
the
profound
flavor
profiles
of
la
fin
du
monde
or
mad
bitch
it
is
sad
that
a
beer
i
once
cherished
has
fallen
out
of
favor
but
i
guess
its
a
testament
to
all
of
the
amazing
brews
ive
had
in
the
past
couple
of
years
doesnt
compare
with
the
belgians
of
the
style
but
im
not
sure
that
is
their
attempt
it
does
come
in
sixers
after
all
though
not
particularly
innovative
not
bad
on
its
own
either
that
s
a
pretty
good
beer
and
very
true
to
style
in
every
respect
which
is
good
however
one
little
difference
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
which
is
a
good
thing
actually
it
is
a
really
nice
sweet
taste
of
honey
fresh
honey
that
is
but
it
still
has
some
hop
bitterness
nd
strong
floral
notes
really
good
i
will
have
this
again
soon
due
to
the
wonderful
flavor
and
the
lack
of
alcohol
presence
it
is
extremely
drinkable
d
i
wasnt
too
enthusiastic
about
finishing
this
and
moved
onto
something
else
afterward
not
something
ill
have
again
d
good
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
had
alcohol
and
bitterness
stop
this
well
short
of
a
perfect
beer
very
impressed
though
d
defiantly
a
sipping
beer
drinkability
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
for
this
matter
may
need
to
just
warm
and
open
up
a
little
but
its
very
metallic
interestingly
its
9
5
abv
something
you
would
not
expect
i
wouldnt
say
its
very
drinkable
and
im
not
one
to
recommend
this
overall
subtle
flavors
high
drinkability
and
decent
abv
equal
tasty
but
the
hype
and
award
winning
title
might
be
stretching
it
unless
they
are
awarding
their
chaotic
chemistry
to
incorporate
such
a
combination
d
pretty
high
abvs
and
heavy
body
means
just
one
for
me
a
very
nice
tripel
at
a
reasonable
price
the
beer
pours
a
bright
pale
banana
yellow
with
a
smallish
white
head
its
mostly
clear
with
a
slight
haze
the
aroma
is
primarily
spice
and
malt
its
a
blend
of
coriander
and
other
belgianstyle
spicing
with
a
sweet
honeyish
grain
note
the
flavor
is
similar
theres
plenty
of
spicing
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
strong
malt
backbone
the
malt
isnt
nearly
as
sticky
as
i
expected
from
the
relatively
high
9
5
abv
despite
the
sweet
malt
flavor
its
actually
a
fairly
dry
beer
refreshing
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
while
maintaining
a
certain
crispness
its
dangerously
easy
to
drink
a
pretty
decent
trippel
there
are
lots
better
though
but
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
too
strong
to
session
cheers
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
and
highly
recommend
it
looking
forward
to
finishing
the
growler
tomorrow
excellent
beer
will
drink
any
day
of
the
week
pale
golden
color
with
a
respectable
white
head
that
fades
to
a
nice
layer
of
bubbles
that
cling
beautifully
to
the
side
of
the
glass
subtle
spice
aromas
with
a
firm
backbone
of
hoppy
citrus
the
carbonation
greets
the
palate
nicely
and
clears
the
way
for
the
zesty
citrus
flavor
in
the
middle
then
it
finishes
with
a
sharp
dryness
that
lingers
for
some
time
the
spicy
notes
do
a
nice
job
of
balancing
out
the
hops
the
high
abv
is
a
bit
more
noticeable
than
i
would
like
it
to
be
on
the
finish
and
it
has
an
overly
sugary
quality
that
i
didnt
find
appealing
otherwise
though
a
good
beer
but
certainly
not
great
somewhat
disappointing
to
be
honest
probably
not
the
best
tripel
i
have
ever
had
but
all
in
all
not
bad
considering
a
bottle
of
chimay
white
is
about
6
the
12
for
the
six
pack
makes
it
more
enjoyable
overall
just
ok
not
tough
to
drink
but
has
some
harsh
edges
i
can
think
of
others
of
the
style
that
id
go
to
first
try
it
but
dont
think
this
is
a
typical
belgian
tripel
the
mouth
is
wellcarbonated
and
a
bit
spritzy
this
is
a
pretty
sweet
tripel
nice
pleasant
citrus
fronting
with
a
spicy
bite
in
the
middle
and
finishes
sweet
and
clean
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
havent
the
greatest
experience
with
this
style
but
i
liked
this
one
this
is
good
beer
anyway
you
look
at
it
and
you
cant
beat
the
price
either
the
guy
at
the
grocery
store
reccommended
this
and
i
cant
stop
drinking
it
six
packs
cost
11
99
and
a
tall
boy
is
6
99
and
this
kicks
in
at
a
heaping
9
5
also
oh
yeah
d
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
abrasive
for
my
liking
and
the
abv
seems
to
overpower
the
flavours
i
would
personally
prefer
a
belgian
tripel
on
tap
pours
a
very
clear
gold
whod
have
thought
with
a
small
white
head
smells
quite
sweet
with
notes
of
citrus
and
banana
as
well
as
a
bit
of
spicy
yeast
tastes
very
sugary
with
a
lot
of
lemon
and
other
fruit
a
bit
peppery
warming
finish
lightmedium
body
over
the
top
and
too
sweet
for
a
tripel
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
due
to
the
bottle
conditioning
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
dry
due
to
the
more
than
usual
amount
of
hops
the
high
abv
limits
consumption
to
one
or
maybe
two
bottles
in
one
session
one
of
the
best
american
made
tripels
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
there
are
a
lot
of
carbonation
bubbles
presence
the
smell
is
of
spices
and
bread
malts
with
a
hint
of
banana
and
clove
present
the
taste
is
of
bread
malts
with
spice
for
sure
present
there
is
also
clove
banana
and
maybe
another
fruity
note
present
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
syrupy
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
distracted
me
a
little
from
drinking
more
of
these
i
thought
that
it
had
a
good
taste
and
aroma
for
a
tripel
but
the
mouthfeel
threw
me
off
d
very
appealing
pleasant
and
not
overbearing
a
dangerously
drinkable
tripel
you
could
easily
get
into
trouble
drinking
these
the
go
down
that
well
this
is
a
nice
tripel
even
if
it
isnt
the
most
traditional
interpretation
of
the
style
a
nice
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
on
the
east
coast
dr
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
abv
overall
i
really
think
this
beer
is
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
which
is
hidden
fairly
well
not
something
i
would
drink
too
many
bottles
of
however
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
for
a
tripel
but
had
some
nice
lacing
and
a
fresh
ring
til
the
end
the
smell
was
clove
bananas
melon
and
some
spice
the
taste
was
the
same
it
was
not
overpowering
on
the
clove
it
was
easy
on
the
mouth
a
little
tart
and
very
refreshing
the
clove
and
bananas
balanced
together
with
the
belgian
yeast
and
coriander
to
make
a
delicious
tripel
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
i
enjoyed
and
will
recommend
for
sure
pretty
good
with
some
age
the
smell
of
sweet
corn
calls
out
dms
spoilage
some
coriander
and
orange
peel
but
not
much
a
flat
feel
to
it
too
bad
nothing
else
going
on
with
this
beer
the
dms
is
in
the
nose
mostly
some
in
the
taste
i
didnt
finish
this
one
and
left
it
downstairs
not
a
beer
ill
seek
out
but
certainly
one
ill
be
drinking
again
d
im
not
a
fan
of
big
beers
like
this
but
i
definately
didnt
hate
it
ill
have
it
again
just
a
tad
strong
though
no
session
for
this
bad
boy
the
monkey
will
get
you
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
strictly
because
it
is
hoppy
enough
to
pass
for
a
poor
belgian
pale
ale
but
soulless
for
a
tripel
d
scary
drinkabilty
this
is
a
very
good
locally
brewed
triple
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
macroishyellow
color
with
a
surprisingly
for
a
tripel
small
12
finger
head
which
disappears
immediately
into
a
modest
lace
whats
not
unexpected
is
the
level
of
carbonation
theres
a
sparkly
effervescence
aroma
is
dry
and
somewhat
citrusy
1st
sip
reveals
the
dry
citrus
character
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
moutfeel
is
tingly
and
there
a
dry
finish
with
a
good
bit
of
alcohol
heat
its
drinkable
but
not
sessionable
the
alcohol
is
just
too
hot
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
allinall
this
is
not
the
best
tripel
ive
ever
had
also
not
my
favorite
offering
from
victory
d
the
alcohol
began
to
effect
me
quickly
there
is
some
residual
stickiness
but
other
than
that
this
is
fairly
drinkable
drinkability
very
strong
brew
drank
on
recommendation
of
a
friend
because
of
the
abv
but
was
very
surprised
at
the
let
down
the
alchol
is
noticeable
and
a
minor
hurdle
i
guess
i
could
palate
this
some
times
but
prefer
others
over
it
plus
the
1st
one
i
drank
had
me
crooked
then
asleep
afterward
drinkability
this
is
a
beast
of
a
tripel
the
beer
is
quite
yummy
but
it
packs
enough
of
a
punch
that
i
wouldnt
and
probably
shouldnt
have
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
i
just
dont
like
the
style
of
this
beer
im
overwhelmed
by
the
yeast
and
phenolic
flavors
nice
for
the
finish
of
a
hot
afternoon
and
definitely
shareable
d
a
tasty
beer
that
drinks
better
than
most
9
5
abv
beers
a
unique
taste
on
the
style
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
this
high
of
alcohol
content
it
easy
to
drink
down
a
few
of
these
with
out
noticing
drinkability
while
its
not
bad
overall
the
rotted
grassiness
kills
this
one
for
me
typicall
i
find
myself
really
enjoying
these
styles
but
this
one
did
not
translate
overly
well
for
me
i
will
still
continue
to
try
beers
from
victory
though
as
theyve
done
pretty
well
for
me
overall
drinkability
pretty
darn
high
but
not
really
the
best
example
of
style
all
told
its
just
decent
i
suppose
but
the
alcohol
started
giving
me
heartburn
about
halfway
through
and
i
just
had
to
quit
drinking
it
just
too
astringent
good
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
d
this
is
a
relatively
drinkable
beer
if
not
for
the
alcohols
insistence
on
being
the
star
of
the
show
i
like
victory
and
tripels
in
general
so
id
probably
buy
this
again
overall
its
not
their
best
offering
though
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
have
3
more
in
the
12
pack
so
ill
get
another
chance
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
tripel
this
would
not
be
my
first
second
or
third
choice
but
the
hop
bite
adds
something
new
here
and
there
is
certainly
more
to
like
than
not
decent
solid
beer
yes
will
i
seek
it
out
again
no
the
9
5
was
a
bit
much
but
had
no
problem
downing
one
sitting
on
my
porch
watching
the
world
pass
by
review
999
for
golden
monkey
fyi
taste
hops
provide
a
mellow
but
lingering
bitterness
nice
spiciness
from
the
yeast
alcohol
provides
only
a
little
bit
of
warmth
but
is
otherwise
undetectable
malt
doesnt
add
a
whole
lot
of
taste
just
some
sweetness
creamy
mouthfeel
in
the
begining
that
turns
dry
in
the
finish
good
carbonation
pretty
good
american
tripel
but
not
my
favorite
ive
bought
this
a
couple
times
and
have
one
aging
in
the
cellar
kind
of
a
clear
tinkley
golden
nothing
at
all
in
the
way
of
sediment
almost
completely
transparent
a
lot
thinner
than
i
remember
also
almost
like
a
golden
vinegar
smells
like
a
sweet
barnyard
a
bit
of
harshness
that
is
also
enhanced
by
a
very
boozey
smell
i
do
love
the
smell
though
taste
is
complicated
this
is
not
a
bythebook
tripel
the
guys
from
victory
are
trying
to
throw
as
much
at
you
as
possible
it
is
sweet
and
very
syrupy
despite
the
thin
appearance
has
kind
of
a
honey
texture
or
smoothness
behind
it
and
you
can
tell
it
tastes
a
bit
nutty
as
it
warms
theres
a
good
bit
of
sharp
spicing
that
becomes
more
and
more
prevalent
a
bit
earthy
a
bit
cough
syrupy
and
a
huge
alcoholic
bite
its
pretty
boozey
and
can
make
for
a
tough
drink
theres
a
ton
of
flavours
but
they
dont
always
do
the
best
job
of
melding
all
together
it
is
pretty
crisp
though
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
low
side
but
it
fits
pretty
well
basically
this
is
a
bastard
americanized
tripel
it
is
interesting
but
not
the
most
true
to
style
and
very
busy
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
it
though
drinkability
scarily
drink
able
and
delicious
long
crispy
refreshing
finish
alcohol
is
extremely
hidden
and
the
beer
is
fine
american
example
of
the
style
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
be
trying
again
great
value
for
the
price
check
it
out
had
this
at
the
philly
airport
it
poured
a
fair
golden
color
just
slightly
hazy
with
a
thin
white
head
and
almost
o
lacing
smelled
spicy
with
some
fruity
undertones
tasted
similar
some
different
fruit
tastes
fig
plum
and
a
little
sweet
a
little
bit
overcarbed
but
otherwise
smooth
i
could
easily
have
put
a
few
more
back
had
i
not
wanted
to
try
some
other
beers
in
the
vicinity
this
is
a
great
tripel
and
one
of
my
favorite
victory
brews
tons
of
flavor
to
sample
and
way
too
easy
to
enjoy
overall
not
a
bad
beer
there
are
better
tripels
to
be
found
most
definitely
from
belgium
but
for
an
american
try
not
too
bad
the
alcohol
really
shows
on
the
nose
and
palate
and
overwhelms
what
could
be
a
great
beer
i
definitely
couldnt
have
more
than
one
god
forbid
i
ever
try
victory
usually
does
great
stuff
but
this
is
a
little
overdone
a
simple
decrease
in
alcohol
from
9
5
to
maybe
8
or
8
5
would
make
a
world
of
difference
d
a
little
too
drinkable
for
a
9
5
tripel
the
sweetness
hides
the
booze
very
well
i
have
to
admit
i
am
a
fan
of
this
style
one
of
the
better
of
the
belgians
however
i
feel
this
beer
somewhat
misses
the
mark
the
body
is
good
with
a
big
yeast
and
hop
profile
and
close
to
10
alcohol
the
aroma
is
clove
and
banana
ester
with
some
flowers
from
the
hops
i
think
this
beer
has
too
much
bitterness
why
not
let
the
yeast
run
free
dial
back
the
bitterness
and
maybe
some
of
those
wonderful
banana
esters
will
come
out
in
the
flavor
not
just
the
aroma
all
in
all
this
beer
is
good
enjoy
it
as
you
would
a
big
young
chardonnay
i
really
hope
theyll
tweak
this
brew
a
bit
in
the
future
could
be
a
great
one
d
drinkable
tripel
while
not
totally
to
style
a
good
solid
beer
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
though
if
available
to
you
this
ones
got
a
kick
to
it
and
that
abvs
going
to
hold
down
the
drinkability
its
also
not
exactly
to
style
so
take
it
as
you
will
fairly
easy
drinking
this
is
very
solid
for
a
12oz
tripel
it
hides
the
9
5
fairly
well
and
has
a
good
enough
complexity
to
leave
you
wanting
more
a
750ml
corked
bottle
poured
into
my
selins
grove
chalice
bottled
on
may
12th
2006
the
monkey
appears
a
hazy
bright
golden
straw
color
with
about
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
bone
white
foam
aroma
consists
of
bananas
clove
tart
green
apples
sweet
malts
tastes
of
toasted
wheat
bread
slathered
with
orange
marmalade
spicy
peppery
yeast
mild
banana
more
sweet
than
bitter
at
over
3
years
in
the
bottle
the
alcohol
has
become
quite
tamed
down
carbonation
is
rather
high
bubbly
tingling
crisp
and
dry
with
a
somewhat
oily
finish
the
monkey
shines
with
a
little
age
on
it
overall
a
top
notch
belgian
tripel
recommended
d
a
little
too
spicy
and
hoppy
for
me
to
have
more
than
1
the
abv
limits
its
use
as
a
session
beer
medium
body
rich
smooth
drinkability
takes
a
hit
due
to
the
richness
but
it
has
really
good
carbonation
to
it
overall
a
really
good
brew
d
man
ive
had
a
hard
time
rating
this
beer
stylistically
its
far
from
the
exceptional
belgian
tripels
such
as
westmalle
and
karmeliet
but
on
its
own
its
a
fucking
fantastic
beer
the
brewed
with
spices
on
the
label
had
me
weary
at
first
but
this
is
an
extremely
well
constructed
beer
and
by
far
one
of
if
not
the
best
offering
from
victory
ive
had
thus
far
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
tripels
that
ive
had
its
pretty
sweet
but
its
also
pretty
damned
tasty
its
no
allagash
but
its
also
only
5
99
for
a
750
ml
this
is
one
hell
of
a
budget
tripel
victory
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
staple
breweries
future
outlook
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
other
clearly
better
easily
accessible
reasonably
priced
alternatives
would
prevent
me
from
buying
this
regularly
totally
able
to
stand
up
without
it
mouthfeel
was
crisp
with
high
carbonation
very
drinkable
id
have
a
few
more
decent
beer
with
a
good
flavor
profile
ill
have
another
someday
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
even
with
a
higher
abv
also
quite
refreshing
a
decent
triple
but
not
great
nice
cloudy
goldstraw
color
but
poor
head
retention
a
pleasant
floral
and
spicy
aroma
and
a
taste
that
starts
nice
but
ends
up
too
cloyingly
sweet
in
my
opinion
ive
had
better
triples
and
this
one
is
fine
and
drinkable
maybe
just
a
bit
below
average
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
tripels
i
have
had
something
i
would
highly
recommend
final
thoughts
a
very
pleasent
drinkable
fun
beer
very
refreshing
fruity
tasty
beer
a
little
pricey
but
im
assuming
its
cause
of
the
alcohol
price
went
down
id
purchase
more
try
it
cloudy
gold
in
color
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
when
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
it
is
brewed
with
spices
as
proclaimed
by
the
brewers
this
is
obvious
through
the
nose
and
the
flavor
the
nose
has
a
character
like
a
milder
version
of
a
winter
warmer
the
attack
is
thick
and
malty
the
flavor
is
ripe
with
cloves
and
spices
the
finish
is
very
confusing
as
there
are
myriad
flavors
swirling
around
and
seemingly
intertwining
with
components
of
the
mouthfeel
some
probably
hail
the
beer
as
complex
and
i
just
cant
help
but
feel
it
is
too
busy
most
brewers
i
prefer
the
bigger
and
bolder
offerings
but
as
for
victory
i
do
recall
being
a
fan
of
the
hop
devil
and
victory
pils
which
means
they
go
completely
against
the
grain
for
me
while
i
am
not
disappointed
to
have
tried
this
beer
i
will
not
buy
it
again
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
been
pawning
them
off
on
guests
because
i
dont
care
to
drink
the
other
5
i
feel
like
simon
cowell
sorry
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
pour
with
a
3

is
very
nice

on

9
0
d
drinkability
would
have
to
be
low
considering
the
high
alcohol
taste
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
belgium
white
im
assuming
that
is
a
good
result
for
the
tripel
beverage
its
my
1st
victory
beer
of
the
night
id
like
to
maybe
try
it
again
as
my
1st
beverage
right
now
ill
say
its
average
slightly
above
hints
of
banana
esters
golden
monkey
medium
body
nice
coating
not
my
favorite
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
tripels
d
the
alcohol
isnt
masked
in
this
but
it
warms
your
throat
on
the
way
down
and
has
a
nice
soothing
effect
the
abv
would
keep
me
from
having
many
of
these
but
overall
id
say
this
has
average
drinkability
d
id
say
not
hard
to
do
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
overall
it
is
not
an
amazing
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
good
beer
to
try
final
thoughts
a
decent
entry
into
the
world
of
tripels
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
a
good
effort
for
victory
definitely
worth
a
try
d
i
cant
really
call
this
more
than
a
decent
tripel
id
prefer
it
were
a
bit
maltier
and
spicer
as
it
stands
it
comes
across
as
too
watery
and
alcoholic
for
my
taste
certainly
not
bad
and
easy
to
drink
but
a
tripel
should
be
something
to
sip
and
savor
and
this
doesnt
quite
meet
that
goal
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
full
threefingers
of
beige
head
the
retention
was
ok
as
a
thin
skim
and
the
lacing
consistent
the
aroma
was
onpoint
for
a
tripel
belgian
yeast
fruity
esters
alcohol
sweet
malts
bready
malt
floral
hops
and
spices
the
flavors
were
equally
complex
starting
with
citrusy
hops
it
then
went
into
spices
lots
of
fruity
esters
the
twang
of
yeast
sour
green
apples
pears
caramel
malt
and
towards
the
end
it
got
a
little
nippy
with
a
clear
alcohol
note
that
left
a
slick
on
my
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
medium
a
good
example
of
the
style
being
produced
on
this
side
of
the
pond
drinkability
this
is
9
5
wow
thats
scary
drinkability
this
could
be
a
dangerous
one
i
found
myself
getting
a
bit
carried
away
and
take
extra
large
gulps
of
this
simply
for
the
fact
that
it
is
easily
quaffible
but
dont
let
this
fool
you
this
is
a
beer
that
disguises
the
abv
so
well
that
you
could
overindulge
and
might
end
up
on
the
wrong
end
of
the
alcohol
stick
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgians
but
i
found
this
refreshing
and
pretty
modest
stick
with
1
or
2
in
a
session
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
slighty
hazy
golden
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
quickly
disappears
smell

is

with
most

lightmedium
mouthfeel
that
drys
the

decent
drinkabilty
for
a
tripel
good
for
its
style
but
not
in
the
league
of
la
fin
du
monde
or
schlaflys
tripel
watch
out
very
drinkable
2
or
3
in
a
drinking
session
is
about
right
if
you
can
make
it
to
the
restaurant
in
downingtown
they
limit
you
to
only
2
of
these
enjoy
d
very
drinkable
but
god
damn
this
stuff
is
strong
after
one
12oz
bottle
im
feeling
the
buzz
im
not
complaining
or
anything
but
i
think
if
i
were
going
to
spend
the
night
drinking
this
id
have
to
plan
on
having
someone
carry
me
to
my
bed
overall
impression
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
the
fruitiness
and
the
lightness
in
body
make
this
an
easy
beer
to
drink
the
9
5
abv
adds
the
danger
i
can
see
limiting
myself
to
1
or
2
when
out
or
just
staying
home
and
drinking
a
few
more
than
2
not
a
prime
example
of
the
style
but
a
solid
brew
especially
for
the
price
had
this
on
tap
at
the
houston
flying
saucer
poured
in
a
tulip
glass
bright
orange
color
smell
of
mostly
clove
and
banana
spicy
in
taste
with
lots
of
coriander
orange
and
some
clove
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
smooth
finish
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
will
definately
try
it
again
d
too
much
abv
to
drink
all
night
but
drinkable
enough
to
drink
more
than
you
probably
should
drinkability
high
abv
is
the
only
thing
holding
this
back
from
being
a
decent
session
beer
poured
into
duvel
glass
with
very
little
head
quite
disappointed
actually
shimmers
with
golden
hues
smells
floral
bit
of
caramel
and
bread
crust
coming
through
overall
a
bit
subdued
the
taste
is
quite
good
nice
bit
of
hops
of
front
blending
into
caramelvegetal
nice
bit
of
spice
with
this
had
this
with
pasta
and
heavy
spice
worked
out
quite
well
this
one
goes
down
quite

light
if
not
a

carbonated
high
abv
will
put
you
down
as
i
didnt

taste
here
good
beer
not
great
for
the
style
though
drinkability
a
solid
well
made
tripel
ill
be
having
more
of
this
in
the
future
as
it
is
part
of
the
victory
variety
case
sold
in
pa
a
choice
that
i
for
one
applaud
the
only
downside
is
that
i
am
almost
completely
worthless
the
day
following
consumption
and
yes
its
happening
again
drink
with
caution
and
have
nothing
strenuous
planned
mentally
or
otherwise
putting
on
my
sweatpants
correctly
followed
by
successfully
microwaving
a
pizza
is
the
best
possible
outcome
for
tomorrow
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
inch
thick
head
you
can
smell
the
yeasty
spicy
belgian
sweetness
taste
is
sweet
floral
spicy
clove
and
warm
alcohol
could
really
parse
through
all
of
the
differnt
flavors
the
clove
spice
mixes
well
with
the
high
carbonation
tingle
and
alcohol
to
create
a
good
bite
the
flavor
does
last
a
long
time
and
shows
up
stronger
and
stronger
after
the
initial
taste
very
tasty
and
there
is
a
stong
alcohol
flavor
that
sticks
around
very
smooth
mouthfeel
d
this
one
tastes
green
it
could
use
some
time
in
the
cellar
to
reduce
the
spiciness
and
alcohol
burn
and
let
the
malts
tastes
come
through
a
little
more
one
is
enough
for
this
one
right
now
not
victorys
finest
d
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
not
the
best
tripel
that
i
have
had
but
still
a
quality
beer
i
know
that
the
spicy
flavor
is
not
for
everyone
but
i
enjoy
it
dmoderate
to
high
quite
complex
and
enjoyable
along
with
being
easy
to
drink
despite
the
higher
abv
drinkability
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
many
tripels
and
this
beer
embodies
a
number
of
things
i
dont
like
about
the
style
way
too
hot
and
sweet
with
a
lack
of
balance
to
some
this
may
be
a
classic
tripel
and
i
can
understand
their
perspective
it
is
just
not
the
interpretation
of
the
style
that
i
prefer
overall
this
just
isnt
a
great
beer
the
only
difference
between
this
time
and
last
is
that
now
i
understand
what
it
is
i
dont
like
about
it
could
get
a
case
of
this
very
nice
d
very
good
a
respectable
offering
from
an
american
brewery
ive
had
better
trippels
but
i
also
paid
considerably
more
for
them
drinkability
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
locate
drank
fine
good
amount
of
abv
so
just
had
a
12oz
an
enjoyable
beer
just
disheartened
by
the
looks
and
waste
due
to
overfoaming
a
decent
brew
wrecked
by
some
weird
finish
dont
know
whats
going
on
but
the
bottle
seems
fine
every
other
way
prickly
carbonation
which
is
strong
gives
way
to
some
creaminess
although
the
alcohol
plays
well
as
a
part
of
the
taste
profile
it
is
too
evident
to
make
this
that
drinkable
an
ok
brew
from
victory
i
havent
been
too
hot
for
victory
after
trying
a
number
of
their
issues
but
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
try
seems
to
be
their
headliner
two
words
come
to
mind
right
away
after
first
sip
spice
notes
very
spicy
beer
its
good
but
not
as
good
as
an
allagash
white
or
a
la
fin
du
monde
theres
something
a
little
off
in
the
spice
composition
good
if
youre
looking
for
something
spicy
and
different
but
im
not
buying
again
d
good
for
such
a
strong
beer
very
subtle
for
a
spiced
strong
belgian
i
would
like
to
drink
more
but
i
think
that
would
be
dangerous
d
got
better
as
it
warmed
which
is
its
saving
grace
and
why
its
above
average
i
would
still
have
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
looking
for
it
d
not
so
much
the
high
abv
does
not
scare
me
its
just
that
gm
is
difficult
to
drink
a
nice
warming
from
the
heat
on
this
cold
snowy
day
so
gm
has
that
going
for
it
this
seems
to
be
pretty
popular
on
the
whole
but
it
is
not
for
me
so
maybe
im
missing
something
i
will
try
this
again
in
another
4
years
to
again
see
whats
what
cool
bottle
though
overall
i
dont
think
the
golden
monkey
is
really
worth
drinking
with
the
abv
i
usually
like
victorys
beer
but
i
really
havent
liked
drinking
the
it
in
the
three
or
four
times
that
ive
had
it
a
nice
drinker
and
a
good
representitive
of
a
triple
high
abv
does
not
make
this
a
session
beer
this
is
a
bit
more
fizzy
than
i
was
hoping
for
but
interesting
flavors
to
say
the
least
not
an
instant
classic
but
still
worth
mentioning
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
the
lack
of
complexity
in
this
beer
relative
to
other
belgian
tripels
im
ok
with
a
simple
tripel
what
bugs
me
is
the
lack
of
any
real
lingering
flavors
all
the
flavors
seem
to
come
and
go
without
leaving
a
lasting
imperssion
definitely
easy
to
drink
which
could
spell
bad
news
for
the
unsuspecting
drinker
the
9
5
abv
could
easily
catch
up
to
you
after
a
few
of
these
still
a
good
beer
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
poured
an
applejuice
orange
from
the
bottle
with
very
little
head
resulting
from
an
aggressive
pour
the
smell
and
taste
are
also
full
of
apple
on
top
of
a
pleasant
tripel
funk
in
the
finish
is
sugary
malt
caramel
and
light
hops
the
beer
is
mediumbodied
and
finishes
dry
while
the
alcohol
doesnt
come
through
too
much
in
the
taste
i
felt
it
to
some
extent
overall
i
enjoyed
golden
monkey
more
and
more
as
i
sipped
on
it
2
5
d
easily
the
worst
tripel
ive
ever
had
what
the
hell
is
victory
doing
all
of
their
other
beers
have
been
great
or
better
d
rather
harsh
considering
the
lingering
taste
and
heavy
alcohol
notes
only
2
of
these
max
drinkability
a
good
beer
that
goes
down
easily
the
profile
is
hardly
complex
but
friendly
a
bit
overhyped
but
not
a
failure
edit
its
growing
on
me
the
more
often
i
try
it
not
bad
stuff
note
i
planned
on
giving
victory
a
pass
on
the
carbonation
issue
but
almost
every
review
on
the
front
page
mentioned
the
light
amount
of
carbonation
in
their
own
fresh
bottles
if
this
had
been
a
side
effect
of
the
aging
of
the
beer
i
wouldnt
have
marked
down
for
it
but
it
seems
to
be
more
a
side
effect
of
the
beer
itself
also
for
the
record
between
my
wife
and
myself
we
didnt
make
it
through
a
full
half
of
the
bottle
before
we
dpd
it
not
big
on
this
brew
when
golden
monkey
is
poured
a
nice
centimeter
head
appears
but
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
with
some
foam
in
the
middle
golden
monkey
has
an
orange
tint
with
a
bit
of
yellow
shining
through
tons
of
esters
come
through
some
citrus
and
spicy
yeast
notes
also
come
through
and
there
is
also
a
slight
bit
of
bready
yeast
character
while
drinking
this
beer
a
huge
carbonation
bite
hints
your
tongue
but
a
quite
smooth
estery
flavour
comes
through
however
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
coming
through
at
the
end
which
is
to
be
expected
while
lingering
around
in
my
mouth
i
get
a
lot
of
a
fruity
flavours
oranges
and
almost
an
apricot
flavour
are
the
most
prevalent
only
a
bit
of
phenolic
characters
come
through
though
and
there
also
isnt
much
malt
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
exactly
where
it
should
be
the
beer
isnt
outstanding
but
a
solid
example
of
a
tripel
thanks
to
shawn
for
sharing
excellent
drinkability
drinkability
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
overall
it
was
enjoyable
it
was
not
your
typical
tripel
and
felt
almost
like
a
champagne
its
a
beer
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
drink
a
definite
sipper
sadly
i
was
forced
to
down
this
rather
quickly
alcohol
is
formidable
and
theres
a
bit
too
much
going
on
to
make
the
beer
fully
drinkable
but
for
a
nice
take
on
the
style
this
is
certainly
a
good
pick
overall
this
is
a
decent
interpretation
of
a
triple
and
seeing
as
im
not
that
big
of
a
victory
fan
or
a
tripel
fan
for
that
matter
im
surprised
that
their
belgian
style
ale
turned
out
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
them
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
i
heard
some
good
reviews
and
was
told
it
had
the
price
tag
to
go
along
with
it
after
trying
it
i
was
let
down
the
taste
was
very
bold
but
muddy
the
flavors
sort
of
jumbled
together
i
struggled
to
finish
the
bottle
it
could
just
be
my
palate
but
this
one
will
go
in
the
once
is
enough
category
a
decent
tripel
doesnt
compare
to
the
monastaries
the
funkiness
in
the
aroma
wasnt
very
pleasant
and
i
thought
the
clove
was
a
little
heavy
in
this
beer
nonetheless
a
solid
effort
d
very
low
considering
i
have
all
of
the
other
victory
hop
and
stout
beers
to
choose
from
also
with
9
5
give
me
an
imperial
stout
any
day
no
question
asked
this
review
will
remind
me
to
always
stay
away
from
the
fat
monkey
this
is
a
very
herbaly
spiced
beer
the
apperance
is
a
very
golden
sunlight
color
the
taste
is
of
a
traditional
german
malt
with
whole
flower
european
hops
with
definate
tones
of
yeast
of
a
belgian
orgin
there
are
also
sutble
aftertones
of
peppermint
and
exotic
worldly
spices
from
the
far
corners
of
the
earth
it
has
a
very
delicate
mouthfeel
lets
leave
it
at
that
the
overall
drinkability
is
sub
par
i
like
other
vitory
beersz
better
d
a
decent
well
flavored
tripel
if
i
had
another
id
pass
it
along
d
this
is
a
good
solid
belgian
style
the
high
alc
doesnt
cut
through
the
flavor
and
it
has
just
the
right
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
i
raise
my
glass
i
would
say
this
is
a
tripel
of
my
liking
yeasty
and
sweet
poured
golden
with
a
large
active
head
aroma
is
soapy
and
astringent
but
good
flavor
is
laced
with
a
subtle
pepper
component
the
lingering
flavor
is
a
sourness
across
the
roof
of
the
throat
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
considering
the
abv
the
glowing
yellow
to
light
orange
color
allows
the
thin
yet
active
bubble
beads
to
be
viewed
with
ease
two
finger
white
head
upon
the
pour
takes
its
time
fading
off
sweet
cinnamon

cumin
spices

through
the

lively
tangerine
and
lemon
zest
suggestions
of
apricot
and
peach
fruit
alert
for
the
weight
it
possesses
in
the
nostrils
grips
well
medium
to
fullbodied
the
carbonated
fizz
teams
up
with
the
sweet
baking
spices
for
a
zesty
attack
creates
a
fetching
inner
mouth
perfume
the
lemon
orange
citrus
entirely
in
place
much
hoppier
here
in
the
mouth
so
fewer
fruit
flavors
yet
breadiness
and
honey
glaze
directly
expressed
cleans
up
adequately
after
itself
while
leaving
sufficient
residue
to
reverb
for
some
time
as
far
as
spiced
ale
goes
balanced
and
not
pushy
pours
a
golden
cloudy
color
with
alot
of
particulatesalso
very
thick
white
heading
an
immediate
smell
of
hops
and
alot
of
it
a
decent
amount
of
honey
also
with
the
9
5
abv
you
cant
really
taste
too
much
of
it
the
hoppiness
a
bit
overpowering
for
me
but
all
and
all
a
good
brew
has
a
sligtly
sweet
taste
with
a
bitterness
towards
the
end
with
alcohol
noted
feels
smooth
on
the
palate
with
moderate
carbonation
and
could
easily
put
down
a
couple
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
a
decent
tripel
and
worth
trying
drinkability
is
too
good
for
the
abv
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
before
they
hit
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
after
one
im
probably
done
definitely
moving
on
after
two
alcohol
shines
through
and
its
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
deasy
to
drink
but
be
careful
with
the
abvit
can
sneak
up
on
you
the
smell
reminds
me
more
of
a
wit
or
a
hefebut
otherwise
no
complaints
for
a
triple
it
almost
delivers
not
a
bad
beer
but
can
do
a
lot
better
in
the
triple
family
after
2
of
these
i
will
switch
to
regular
beer
as
i
dont
want
to
get
totally
trashed
d
a
nice
sipper
which
i
like
but
compared
to
other
triples
it
really
lacks
in
some
areas
and
has
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
presence
drinkability
i
probably
would
skip
this
one
in
my
next
round
it
goes
down
smooth
but
becomes
too
boozy
after
a
few
sips
the
feel
is
creamy
on
the
palate
but
fizzy
like
champagne
damn
nice
overall
a
fine
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
balanced
bittersweetsourspicy
real
nice
this
is
fairly
drinkable
none
of
the
tastes
are
overpowering
and
it
is
a
well
brewed
beer
poured
golden
and
cloudy
with
a
head
that
dissipated
quickly
i
really
enjoyed
the
smell
of
bananas
and
cloves
and
was
excited
to
taste
slightly
disappointed
after
the
smell
and
appearance
it
started
fruity
and
ended
mildly
spicy
the
carbonation
wasnt
overwhelming
i
could
have
two
of
these
and
probably
need
a
nap
if
i
drank
them
to
quickly
based
on
the
abv
d
not
bad
i
just
dont
think
the
aromaflavors
blend
well
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
well
spiced
and
tasty
i
must
admit
that
the
aroma
was
more
attractive
than
the
taste
but
still
a
very
good
beer
i
have
a
750ml
bottle
in
the
cellar
that
im
eager
to
meet
again
in
a
few
years
note
does

lot
more
when
i
first
sampled
it
firm
on
the
palate
it
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggested
although
fruity
and
candy
like
notes
abound
alcohol
and
a
bitter
bite
come
and
go
to
provide
some
balance
it
lacks
depth
and
over
time
the
sweet
stuff
just
overpowers
i
am
a
big
fan
of
both
sweet
beers
which
this
one
was
not
supposed
to
beand
belgian
style
ales
unfortunately
this
one
does
not
please
me
a
lot
on
either
aspect
have
fun
overall
this
brew
is
much
more
wellbalanced
than
the
young
version
but
i
really
miss
the
esters
i
think
i
really
love
victorys
offbalance
brews
they
bring
certain
great
flavors
to
the
forefront
while
the
aged
golden
monkey
is
quite
great
rivaling
many
belgian
trippels
ive
had
its
not
the
same
as
the
crazy
young
beer
that
got
me
into
belgians
to
begin
with
overall
horrible
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
consumed
i
had
to
pour
the
remaining
third
of
the
beer
down
the
drain
and
rinse
my
repeatedly
with
the
closest
beer
i
could
find
i
will
never
buy
this
one
again
this
stuff
is
strong
real
strong
drink
responsibly
i
have
a
buddy
who
drank
four
of
them
in
a
night
without
remembering
they
were
9
and
he
ended
up
in
bad
shape
drinker
beware
poured
into
a
12oz
glass
from
the
bottle
forming
a
cream
colored
head
over
a
yellowgold
body
very
slight
haze
and
a
good
bit
of
visible
carbonation
the
head
disipates
to
a
thin
cap
on
the
top
of
the
beer
that
nicely
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
quite
sweet
and
somewhat
alcoholic
in
nature
too
damn
complex
for
me
to
describe
maybe
grains
and
sugar
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
equally
complicated
malt
up
front
then
a
light
floral
hops
taste
with
an
overall
spice
bite
with
a
light
alcohol
presence
hell
lets
make
this
simple
it
tastes
and
smells
real
good
its
real
creamy
too
slightly
dry
finish
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
i
think
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beverage
but
the
high
abv
kicks
it
out
of
session
beer
category
most
of
the
time
sayonara
flavors
are
alright
ultra
sweet
juicyfruit
gum
drying
alcohol
in
the
finish
body
is
mellow
and
carbonation
is
low
mild
astringency
some
floral
aspect
to
the
aftertaste
overall
its
not
bad
just
not
something
i
would
return
to
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
when
starting
to
investigate
the
belgian
styles
im
not
saying
its
as
good
as
some
of
the
classics
but
its
very
interesting
and
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
and
goes
down
very
easy
maybe
a
little
too
easy
for
a
9
5
a
very
big
beer
and
not
as
typically
clear
and
refined
as
true
belgian
tripels
a
good
beer
but
not
one
for
the
lighthearted
taste
is
very
much
a
liquid
profile
of
the
smell
sweet
fruity
slightly
grassy
overall
too
sweet
for
my
taste
really
lacking
in
the
belgian
spiciness
and
yeasty
complexity
this
is
what
happens
when
american
do
a
belgian
stylebelgian
without
belgian
complexitygood
but
not
graet
if
you
are
new
to
triples
definately
try
this
one
if
you
can
appreciate
the
finer
points
of
westmalle
triple
or
de
dolle
du
tevestick
to
what
you
know
the
taste
is
not
a
pleasant
one
i
had
a
couple
of
more
sips
just
to
make
sure
it
was
as
bad
as
i
had
remembered
it
was
i
am
an
admitted
ipa
and
stout
fan
this
wheat
beer
is
simply
not
good
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
ever
again
but
i
will
be
back
to
victory
for
plenty
of
the
prima
pills
and
hop
devil
an
interesting
beer
but
not
my
favorite
ameribelgian
brew
victorys
other
beers
are
full
of
flavor
and
delicious
this
one
is
just
a
little
funky
and
boozy
go
for
hop
devil
instead
a
very
enjoyable
beer
quite
an
unusual
balance
even
though
the
sweetness
kind
of
takes
over
about
half
way
through
deceptively
high
abv
makes
you
think
twice
about
having
too
many
good
beer
although
i
think
some
aging
will
do
it
wonders
dcareful
with
this
one
victory
is
known
or
should
be
for
making
high
abv
beers
that
sneak
up
on
you
drinkability
very
good
could
sit
back
and
hammer
of
few
of
these
which
could
be
dangerous
considering
the
abv
victory
has
arrived
in
maine
and
i
am
very
happy
to
see
it
this
beer
is
a
great
tripel
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
it
had
a
fruity
banana
and
spicy
clove
aroma
fruit
and
spice
in
the
taste
some
biscuity
malt
warming
alcohol
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
i
was
tempted
to
drink
more
of
the
6
pack
but
stopped
after
two
this
is
one
beer
which
is
always
on
my
to
buy
list
it
many
ways
reminds
me
of
the
degarre
in
bruges
well
do
it
again
but
next
time
ill
buy
the
whole
six
instead
of
a
single
pretty
strong
stuff
so
im
not
sure
id
have
more
than
two
12ozs
at
a
time
d
too
spicy
to
be
chuggable
but
it
is
very
pleasant
in
slow
consumption
the
first
belgian
i
ever
tried
a
pretty
good
one
too
now
that
ive
had
others
i
see
it
isnt
the
best
interpretation
but
its
still
very
good
very
spicy
i
mean
like
super
spicy
this
will
turn
off
a
lot
of
people
but
i
thought
it
was
a
good
flavor
the
taste
did
seem
to
vary
by
bottle
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
a
flavorful
beer
that
really
warmed
you
up
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
d
at
9
5
its
pretty
potent
i
enjoyed
two
of
them
and
was
very
happy
the
taste
of
cinnamon
stopped
me
from
having
a
third
the
drinkability
of
this
9
brew
is
scary
it
is
easy
to
polish
of
three
bottles
but
you
better
not
drive
home
after
trust
me
take
your
time
and
really
enjoy
this
one
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
complex
and
appealing
aromas
and
flavors
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
to
be
sessionable
but
a
couple
at
a
time
is
nice
there
is
plenty
to
taste
just
not
that
great
of
a
taste
there
are
better
tripels
but
def
worth
a
try
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
stuck
around
smelled
of
everything
citrus

and
earthy

there
was
literally
pupl
floating
the
the
beer
the
taste
broke
free
of
of
the
smell
with
and
upfront
sweetness
followed
by
smooth
finish
my
friend
put
it
best
and
i
completely

allowed

but
once
you
get
out
of
review
mode
nice
cloudy
golden
honey
body
but
pours
with
almost
no
head
and
i
dont
really
like
that
for
a
tripel
the
aroma
is
pretty
quiet
which
is
a
shame
because
what
i
get
seems
to
be
truly
pleasant
but
i
wish
it
was
more
expressive
it
seems
quite
yeasty
not
unlike
an
apple
pie
crust
and
with
a
deep
malt
profile
fresh
harvest
oranges
pears
bananas
melon
bubblegum
honeyish
and
spicy
ginger
mostly
there
is
a
restrained
alcohol
suggestion
in
the
back
as
well
the
first
sip
surprises
by
the
lively
carbonation
which
is
very
tonguecleaning
and
complements
the
bananahoneyyeasty
palate
interestingly
to
my
liking
very
flowery
herbal
and
appealing
taste
with
obvious
but
well
contained
warming
alcohol
notes
oh
yeah
the
mouthfeel
fits
the
overall
experience
like
a
charm

so
thick

plain

silky

the
bottle
has
bits
of
what
not
floating
in
it
which
are
not
really
noticeable
once
the
beer
is
poured
a
nice
foamy
head
of
about
an
inch
or
so
emerges
and
stays
around
for
awhile
there
is
a
nice
golden
color
smell
is
some
what
fruity
but
not
over
bearing
the
taste
is
is
also
fruity
and
rather
pleasant
contray
to
some
other
reviews
i
could
not
taste
the
alcohol
whatsoever
it
is
certainly
there
however
posseing
a
problem
cuz
i
found
this
rather
drinkable
this
is
a
great
take
on
the
style
a
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
mine
was
only
a
year
and
a
month
old
when
sampled
would
like
to
try
a
2
and
3
year
old
specimen
dn
wonderfully
tasty
with
just
a
bit
too
much
abv
to
make
this
a
good
session
still
this
is
a
wonderful
offering
and
should
be
tasted
by
everyone
a
nice
warming
quality
relatively
smooth
however
there
seems
to
be
nothing
exceptional
about
this
tripel
i
cant
really
find
tripels
around
my
area
so
when
i
saw
a
fresh
6pack
of
the
golden
monkey
i
decided
to
nab
it
quickly
bottled
on
march
20
2004
poured
out
a
nice
goldenorange
color
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
in
it
smell
was
mostly
sweet
some
malts
grapes
and
some
spice
in
there
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
its
like
a
onetwo
punch
of
sweet
and
spicy
candylike
sweetness
hits
first
then
fades
away
to
a
spicytart
flavors
some
hops
can
be
detected
as
well
not
a
bad
beer
maybe
just
a
little
bit
more
balancing
may
be
in
order
for
this

be

im
getting

version

a

tripel
this
is
the
weakest
victory
offering
ive
tried
thus
far
not
bad
just
not
that
great
as
i
felt
with
similar
beers
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
try
and
that
is
about
it
i
wouldnt
buy
more
than
one
of
these
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
in
concept
alone
this
beer
acheives
much
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
orange
ok
apricot
hue
under
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
disappeared
way
way
way
too
quickly
for
a
trippel
hardly
a
few
sips
had
passed
before
the
head
was
nothing
but
film
and
collar
tsk
tsk
the
nose
is
lovely
however
with
fruits
and
spices
leaning
towards
sweet
the
mouth
is
very
carbonated
and
heavy
with
the
spice
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
apricots
and
raisins
and
spicey
coriander
and
a
touch
of
well
vanilla
theres
a
very
subtle
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
but
this
is
all
about
the
fruit
and
spice
plus
the
alcohol
not
my
favorite
beer
but
its
quite
tasty
a
big
impressive
brew
besting
many
other
triples
this
one
comes
highly
recommended
good
job
victory
im
psyched
to
try
their
others
wow
this
seem
to
be
quite
the
brew
did
not
realize
that
it
was
9
5
abv
the
brew
poured
to
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
broke
down
very
quickly
with
hardily
any
lacing
the
essence
of
this
brew
is
mostly
of
bananas
cloves
citrus
and
sweet
caramel
most
of
these
aromas
are
also
entwined
in
the
taste
of
the
brew
as
the
brew
warmed
you
could
also
notice
a
stronger
and
stronger
rummy
alcohol
taste
overall
this
brew
has
a
number
of
different
flavors
and
smells
going
on
that
seemed
to
spark
the
senses
i
would
classify
it
as
more
interesting
experience
than
a
great
brew
but
it
is
worth
a
try
this
turned
out
to
be
an
excellent
tripel
although
a
little
too
sweet
excellent
effort

by
one
of
the
best
east
coast
breweries
hazy
golden
colored
beer
froathy
white
head
slowly
faded

the
aroma
was
mildly
sweet
some

and
earth
smells
the
flavor
was
similar
with
apricot
light
malt
and
some
yeasty
flavors
a
smooth
fairly
light
bodied
beer
that
coats
the
tongue
with
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
for
it
very
zesty
it
has
a
a
lot
of
belgian
esters
going
on
very
much
like
their
grand
cru
it
has
a
nice
peach
color
with
fruity
smells
while
the
taste
is
wonderful
and
complex
due
to
the
yeast
used
im
assuming
here
it
has
a
lot
of
sweet
and
fruitlike
flavors
which
lower
its
drinkability
very
good
but
in
small
doses
this
brew
comes
out
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
white
head
comprised
of
small
bubbles
the
scent
is
grainy
with
some
citrus
notes
as
well
this
beer
is
quite
sweet
lots
of
candysugar
flavors
you
can
definately
feel
the
alcohol
and
its
spicy
flavor
is
noticed
as
the
beer
goes
down
not
a

beer

with
the
infamous
golden
monkey
of
lore
few
have
heard
the
name
and
even
less
have
gazed
upon
its
hazy
gold
existence
the
cloudy
effervescent
liquid
holds
a
slight
ring
above
the
head
of
this
animal
its
smell
is
a
sweet
banana
mango
and
apricot
which
is
very
hard
to
miss
the
flavors
of
the
sweet
malts
more
fruits
and
hints
of
spices
that
leave
no
taste
bud
untouched
as
the
flavor
leaves
and
we
descend
away
from
the
monkey
an
oily
sticky
sweet
hint
of
malts
and
alcohol
is
left
in
the
mouth
to
slowly
disappear
only
to
return
by
drinking
another
come
hither
children
taste
the
monkey
this
was
tart
enough
to
make
me
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
the
fact
that
i
purchased
it
from
a
reputable
store
and
it
was
9
5abv
and
bottle
conditioned
sorta
ruled
that
out
i
guess
its
just
a
different
interpretation
of
the
style
unfortunately
one
i
dont
care
for
drinkability
maybe
a
little
too
heavy
for
session
drinking
but
i
could
still
drink
a
few
notes
the
alcohol
taste
can
ruin
this
one
for
you
its
not
overly
complex
heck
its
not
even
complex
if
you
have
some
friends
over
start
with
something
you
love
then
finish
with
this
wicked
expensive
for
what
you
get
i
guess
it
doesnt
hurt
to
try
but
damn
i
know
ill
never
buy
this
again
previous
gms
ive
had
are
supersweet
or
citrusy
or
even
pretty
mellow
i
have
had
more
than
my
share
of
gm
bottles
that
i
have
not
enjoyed
though
the
only
time
ive
had
it
taste
good
consistently
was
at
the
brewery
itself
there
are
many
better
and
more
authentic
versions
of
the
tripel
out
there
but
for
a
strong
belgian
golden
ale
the
monkey
suits
me
just
fine
ive
had
some
off
batches
from
time
to
time
when
the
flavors
seem
even
more
over
the
top
than
usual
but
overall
its
an
enjoyable
sipping
brew
citrusy
sweet
and
malty
but
also
floral
nice
bright
golden
color
does
its
name
justice
its
so
drinkable
with
its
mildly
carbonated
mouthfeel
that
you
cant
help
but
drink
a
few
too
many
golden
monkey
was
a
light
clear
straw
color
the
head
was
creamy
white
and
didnt
linger
too
long
the
aroma
was
busy
metallic
clovey
and
earthy
the
taste
was
metallic
citrusy
and
a
little
yeasty
there
was
also
some
sweetness
that
helped
take
the
edge
off
the
bitterness
the
high
alcohol
content
also
took
the
edge
off
of
few
things
the
finish
was
a
bit
dry
and
citrusy
victory
i
like
this
one
of
course
im
into
the
second
bottle
at
9abv
that
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
well
done
even
if
the
high
abv
is
too
obvious
but
that
might
be
likable
to
some
drinkers
including
me
it
pours
a
light
straw
color
although
it
has
some
different
charecteristics
this
has
a
very
sweet
malty
flavor
to
it
and
the
typical
barelywine
flavor
that
masks
or
mixes
the
sweetness
of
malt
and
alchohol
while
the
belgian
style
is
not
my
fav
per
say
it
has
a
nice
all
around
charecter
esp
if
you
age
it
grad
a
couple
and
enjoy
your
night
oelergud
overall
my
first
victory
beer
is
a
bust
its
just
to
citrusy
i
think
im
getting
gerd
because
of
it
a
similair
beer
that
is
paletteable
is
heavyweights
lunacy
some
times
its
good
to
have
dessert
first
and
then
again
and
again
and
again
the
monkey
is
fun
i
first
had
this
at
the
standard
tap
in
philadelphia
it
was
the
perfect
beer
to
try
on
my
first
visit
to
the
tap
id
like
to
think
that
its
better
on
tap
then
from
a
bottle
but
my
tap
experience
was
long
ago
the
monkey
poured
cloudy
and
appeared
to
have
a
honey
color
the
head
built
quickly
but
also
faded
quickly
it
was
easy
enough
to
stir
more
foam
by
swirling
the
glass
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
sweet
which
is
why
i
think
its
perfect
to
have
for
dessert
a
habit
that
developed
recently
this
beer
commands
your
attention
because
if
you
let
your
guard
down
the
monkey
will
have
its
way
with
you
monkey
its
just
fun
to
say
clear
golden
yellow
with
an
impotent
head
as
far
as
a
tripel
is
concerned
glass
seems
quite
carbonated
but
the
head
struggled
and
settled
quickly
nose
is
acidic
with
notable
spice
coriander
mainly
hmm
has
quite
a
bit
of
bite
at
first
and
it
settles
into
acid
and
hop
the
malt
flavor
is
genuine
and
a
sweetness
lingers
on
the
tongue
wheres
the
yeast
i
dunno
a
good
brew
but
seems
like
a
tripel
adapted
for
the
masses
it
poured
a
hazy
golden
orange
but
without
a
head
immediately
i
was
drawn
to
it
by
its
color
the
smell
is
fruity
tasty
if
that
can
be
a
smell
it
makes
one
want
to
drink
it
right
away
the
taste
is
sweet
not
so
much
malty
or
like
honey
but
just
sweet
you
get
the
sweet
which
gives
way
to
the
sour
and
finishes
off
with
an
alcoholic
aftertaste
that
isnt
bad
at
all
i
would
have
liked
more
complex
flavors
as
the
taste
was
good
but
could
be
improved
perhaps
with
spices
the
taste
is
smooth
and
barring
the
high
alcohol
content
i
could
spend
all
night
with
this
beer
dark
gold
clear
color
lots
of
active
carbonation
big
white
head
that
fills
out
the
top
of
the
goblet
i
am
sampling
it
out
of
smells
fruity
almost
like
champagne
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
not
particularily
flavorful
has
a
very
sweet
flavor
that
finishes
with
hops
and
alcohol
not
up
to
victorys
other
beers
somewhat
of
a
disapointment
overall
another
triumph
for
victory
this
is
an
excellent
brew
with
some
good
characteristics
take
this
one
for
a
dance
i
love
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
and
spices
it
has
a
very
fruity
smell
and
a
belgian
pale
malt
scent
the
taste
is
good
again
it
has
the
traditional
belgian
abbey
flavor
but
with
a
banana
flavor
from
the
different
spices
and
the
amount
of
malts
it
has
an
elevated
aba
9
5
but
the
beer
is
definately
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
a
very
nice
sessions
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
body
with
thin
white
head
aromas
is
light
citrus
fruits
maybe
lemon
and
peach
with
a
typically
spicy
trippel
background
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavors
are
is
simlar
to
the
nose
very
citrus
like
but
doesnt
have
the
yeasty
spicy
tastes
of
great
trippels
mouthfeel
was
not
lively
enough
to
make
it
a
memorable
beer
flavors
had
a
sweet
orange
tasting
foundation
with
cherry
with
some
loamlike
characteristic
an
understated
spice
helped
alot
and
i
thought
there
was
a
hint
of
mint
here
an
herbal
after
palate
was
appriciated
as
was
the
warm
belly
the
mouthfeel
was
not
very
bubbly
was
filling
more
chunky
not
as
many
changes
as
i
am
apt
to
expect
from
this
style
but
it
was
solid
and
straight
ahead
i
like
this
to
a
degree
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
good
id
sub
this
for
a
trippel
or
introduce
someone
with
this
but
if
youve
spoiled
yourself
a
hazy
looking
beer
at
first
but
evidence
that
there
is
a
good
amount
of
yeast
in
it
nice
flowery
aroma
emerges
from
the
glass
this
belgian
style
triple
has
a
smooth
clean
taste
imparting
citrus
like
sweetness
certainly
not
overpowering
in
taste
this
beer
packs
a
punch
with
its
alcohol
content
the
alcohol
is
hidden
i
feel
and
one
must
be
careful
if
they
plan
to
have
more
than
one
overall
a
decent
easy
to
find
triple
which
can
be
consumed
with
a
variety
of
foods
very
carbonated
and
a
medium
feel
drinkability
is
reduced
by
the
abv
spices
tend
to
cloud
the
pepper
taste
id
expect
as
a
warning
for
strong
alcohol
i
put
some
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
time
would
affect
it
not
my
favorite
victory
brew
appearance
was
ok
but
head
quickly
dissipated
smell
was
wheat
like
taste
was
somewhat
citrusy
and
wheaty
not
bad
for
such
a
high
abv
mouthfeel
was
puckery
and
not
overly
pleasant
astringency
kept
drinkability
rating
down
i
bought
a
six
pack
for
8
99
little
pricy
but
i
support
victory
in
all
their
efforts
an
excellent
brew
overall
poured
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
pale
white
head
that
fizzled
down
fast
it
smelled
like
most
other
tripels
but
this
one
kicks
you
what
a
taste
the
alcohol
is
present
but
it
can
be
subtle
with
all
the
spices
one
of
the
more
spicier
beers
i
have
tried
if
you
like
spice
than
this
is
your
beer
this
one
of
the
better
domestic
versions
of
a
tripel
overall
a
solid
offering
although
this
is
still
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
initially
i
thought
i
prefered
golden
monkey
to
new
belgiums
tripel
but
now
id
have
to
say
that
i
prefer
nbs
version
this
is
pretty
good
beer
but
isnt
one
ill
look
for
again
the
taste
is
very
medicinalfruity
hard
to
describe
a
very
strong
beer
that
doesnt
hide
its
alcohol
yet
remains
very
complex
you
get
some
bannana
clove
and
bitter
apple
the
hops
are
pronounced
at
the
end
but
arent
overbearing
this
is
a
strong
beer
that
requires
strong
balance
poured
a
golden
orange
color
with
cloudiness
and
tiny
floating
white
specks
beautiful
white
head
that
stuck
around
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
glass
great
carbonation
the
aroma
was
yeasty
breadlike
and
some
orange
rind
the
taste
was
a
little
musty
great
spiciness
from
clove
and
coriander
i
enjoyed
the
spicy
aspects
of
this
beer
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
the
yeastiness
the
alcohol
level
was
not
as
overpowering
as
i
thought
it
would
be
well
hidden
but
overall
this
beer
failed
to
overwhelm
me
completely
high
abv
is
evident
from
the
after
effects
ill
have
another
please
aromas
of
candied
orange
and
tangerine
in
sugar
syrup
together
with
mild
sweet
spices
black
pepper
cough
medicine
and
hazelnuts
are
suggested
around
the
perimeter
quite
a
mouthful
with
tangy
syrupy
fruit
that
plods
along
nicely
in
total
i
find
that
victory
has
not
overhyped
this
beer
i
think
it
has
not
gotten
enough
press
the
taste
is
almost
addictive
at
least
i
hate
to
think
that
im
coming
back
just
for
the
high
alcohol
content
but
no
it
really
is
the
definition
of
drinkable

appearance
golden

slightly
cloudy

very

some

sweetness
some
earthy

mouthfeel
creamy
fairly
thick
drinkability
good
but
would
prefer
more
dryness
in
the
beer
and
would
be
more
appropriate
to

notes
a
tad
aggressive
and
overwhelming
but
nonetheless
enjoyable
and
challenging
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
the
belgians
but
this
is
about
what
i
expected
bananacloves
on
the
aroma
and
the
initial
taste
pretty
charged
up
carbonation
wise
tastes
like
a
belgian
has
a
high
alcohol
content
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
on
the
taste
it
has
a
hint
of
alcoholwarming
effect
but
doesnt
taste
real
heavy
of
alcohol
actually
pretty
smooth
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
definitely
worth
trying
not
one
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
pours
a
nice
golden
copper
color
with
a
thin
amount
of
head
thought
there
was
a
lot
of
carbonation
decent
armoa
but
i
thought
it
was
a
little
week
slightly
hoppiness
but
mainly
a
spicy
type
smell
the
taste
was
good
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
spice
and
bitternss
hints
of
fruit
and
yeast
not
to
strong
for
such
a
high
alcohol
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
nice
carbonation
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
slightly
yeasty
but
some
citrus
overtones
were
apparant
the
taste
was
similiar
very
smooth
but
sporting
a
nice
balance
of
malt
bitterness
yeast
and
citrus
very
dry
and
somewhat
crisp
on
the
tongue
one
of
victorys
best
efforts
the
yeast
esters
maltiness
and
hint
of
warming
alcohol
in
this
brew
make
this
a
wonderful
example
of
the
tripel
style
of
beer
i
will
relish
finishing
off
this
six
pack
what
higher
praise
is
there
hazy
golden
ale
with
an
orange
hue
white
head
dies
quickly
leaving
but
a
disorganized
white
film
has
a
wonderful
peppery
spicy
aroma
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
velvety
and
smooth
very
nice
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
terrific
flavor
that
is
fruity
spicy
and
has
a
good
yeasty
malty
thing
going
on
its
great
to
see
an
american
brewer
do
well
at
a
nonameriacan
style
update

i
revisited
this
in
2004
and
was
even
more
impressed
with
the
way
victory
put
this
one
together
after
attending
the
2004
belgian
beer
fest
and
sampling
many
american
efforts
at
the
style
ive
come
to
reallly
appreciate
this
offering
from
the
v
i
was
particularly
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
and
am
raising
that
score
by
0
5
we
all
know
that
victory
is
an
undeniably
worldclass
brewery
but
i
still
dont
know
how
they
managed
golden
monkey
it
runs
with
belgiums
best
and
is
easily
the
best
tripel
ive
ever
ever
had
the
belgianstyle
taste
is
taken
to
a
new
level
by
an
exceptional
fruitiness
that
i
consider
to
be
unequalled
by
any
other
belgianstyle
beer
honestly
when
it
comes
to
tripels
this
is
paramount
the
strong
alcoholic
smell
is
deceiving
compared
to
the
sweet
and
yeasty
taste
this
beer
has
everything
belgium
has
to
offer
and
more
only
the
greatest
trappists
can
top
this
brew
with
regard
to
the
victory
brewery
i
think
golden
monkey
rivals
storm
king
in
terms
of
general
appeal
this
monkey
pours
a
light
gold
color
i
gave
it
a
hard
rapid
pour
and
this
brew
did
produce
a
semi
decent
head
but
it
faded
quickly
the
color
is
a
sight
bit
hazy
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
green
apples
with
tones
of
yeast
and
citrus
hidden
taste
is
smooth
there
is
a
bit
of
a
malt
flavor
with
the
green
apples
mixed
in
with
a
very
slight
yeast
zing
near
the
end
the
flavor
does
masks
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
there
is
always
bubbles
moving
to
the
top
of
the
glass
and
it
has
a
very
nice
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
a
very
enjoyable
brew
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
no
problems
honey
colored
and
surprisingly
tasty
fairly
sweet
yet
a
dry
honey
aftertaste
this
beer
really
sneaks
up
on
you
strengthwise
since
the
malt
covers
the
alcohol
taste
well
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
want
a
strong
sweet
beer
and
are
only
having
one
golden
color
slightly
hazy
medium
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
a
touch
floral
big
bold
beer
with
complex
flavors
tastes
like
a
triple
wit
sweet
and
spicy
with
fruity
and
yeasty
flavors
sour
apples
grapefruit
mango
coriander
and
etc
etc
tart
and
sweet
both
malts
and
hops
and
sweet
and
tart
nicely
balanced
very
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
and
tart
this
is
an
embarrassing
attempt
at
a
belgian
tripel
laughable
sweet
sweet
bready
malts
really
sticky
toilet
cleaner
flavours
one
dimentional
and
boring
i
liked
the
yeast
character
though
but
thats
the
only
positive
the
yeast
tastes
belgian
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
doesnt
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
to
me
i
have
to
guess
this
was
a
bad
bottle
if
its
not
this
would
rank
as
one
of
the
worst
ive
let
past
my
lips
lord
knows
i
tried
my
best
but
ended
up
dumping
the
last
6oz
golden
monkeys
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
quite
appealing
however
the
slightly
rotten
sourness
leads
me
to
one
word
undrinkable
im
happy
i
only
bought
one
this
was
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
have
liked
and
slightly
sweeter
than
most
beers
of
this
style
still
a
solid
effort
and
id
have
this
again
another
victory
for
victory
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
going
in
having
tasted
a
corsendonk
which
i
found
too
champagney
for
my
liking
the
victory
was
smoother
and
more
doughy
creating
a
nice
drinkability
for
so
potent
a
brew
i
could
have
had
another
but
i
would
have
been
sleeping
in
my
chair
for
the
night
overall
the
spiced
fruit
flavors
are
there
but
not
overpowering
i
will
have
a
hard
time
keeping
this
monkey
off
my
back
hazy
golden
hue
with
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
present
fizzy
white
head
dissipates
into
almost
nothing
although
the
thin
ring
of
head
does
leave
sparse
lacing
down
the
chalice
yeasty
doughy
nose
features
notes
of
fruity
esters
and
alcohol
passion
fruit
apple
pear
apricot
yeast
sugar
and
alcohol
all
appear
in
the
taste
department
overall
this
is
a
fruity
sweet
tripelstyle
with
the
high
abv
covered
by
lots
of
candy
sugar
finishes
very
sweet
with
the
sugar
and
alcohol
making
the
most
impact
mouthfeel
is
quite
carbonated
almost
too
overly
so
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
tripel
but
one
that
is
a
bit
too
sugary
to
be
incredibly
enjoyable
even
so
this
is
a
tasty
creation
its
golden
the
head
is
not
much
but
there
the
lace
is
there
its
well
intended
the
truly
interesting
thing
is
its
little
stink
its
like
perfume
good
perfume
has
a
little
rot
in
it
so
does
golden
monkey
it
tastes
a
little
rotten
too
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
its
actually
quite
silky
ill
keep
it
on
hand
always
unless
i
have
tricks
played
on
me
and
then
ill
have
to
make
the
trip
to
downington
drink
this
beer
i
have
previously
had
this
on
tap
at
victorys
brewpub
the
bottled
version
doesnt
appear
to
drastically
differ
from
the
tap
version
except
that
the
head
was
a
bit
weaker
the
beer
is
a
rich
hazy
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
floral
and
fruity
coriander
is
the
most
evident
wonderful
taste
and
mouthfeel
complex
yet
mellow
taste
alchohol
evident
but
subtle
in
taste
ive
convinced
my
local
packy
to
carry
this
albeit
on
a
rotating
basis
very
much
like
duvel
a
superb
beer
dayton
oh
alefestthis
beer
formed
a
small
sized
ivory
head
that
contained
fine
sized
bubbles
that
mostly
diminished
the
body
was
clear
with
some
fizzy
carbonation
and
the
hue
was
yellow
the
nose
was
lightly
malty
light
hops
fruity
sweet
and
some
clove
detected
the
flavor
was
acidic
and
bitter
tasting
along
with
a
smooth
tingly
and
lightmedium
bodied
palate
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
smallish
head
which
diminishes
very
quickly
some
minor
lacing
is
present
on
the
glass
as
well
nice
smelling
floral
and
spicy
scents
tastes
fruity
especially
of
bananas
the
taste
of
the
high
alcohol
content
comes
through
as
well
especially
as
it
warms
a
decent
beer
which
i
will
likely
have
again
although
it
certainly
does
not
rank
as
a
favorite
pours
out
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
medium
to
thick
head
that
lingers
around
for
a
while

bottling
looks
like
a
belgian
triple
should
its
a
strawhazy
yellow
with
a
decent
frothy
white
head
and
decent
carbonation
to
boot
nothing
to
write
home
to
mom
about
but
it
loooks
like
what
i
paid
for
smell
of
sweet
fruity
esters
along
with
some
slight
maltiness
and
barely
detectable
hoppiness
taste
is
excellent
i
remember
trying
this
in
the
past
and
being
a
little
unimpressed
it
seemed
a
bit
all
over
the
place
not
this
time
taste
is
quite
good
with
apples
oranges
grapes
detected
in
the
the
taste
a
bit
sweeter
than
most
triples
but
the
carbonation
helps
balance
this
a
bit
but
not
quite
enough
this
beer
after
a
few
sips
tends
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
decent
mouthfeel
thats
crisp
at
first
but
turns
a
bit
syrupy
alcohol
is
masked
well
im
impressed
victory
seems
to
get
better
better
a
good
attempt
at
a
tough
style
overall
impression
damn
disappointing
actually
had
to
dump
it
its
too
cloyingly
sweet
and
the
alcohol
afterburn
is
not
pleasant
i
dinged
it
bigtime
in
the
drinkability
category
for
that
also
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
was
very
loose
a
big
cloud
of
it
stirred
up
just
by
taking
the
bottle
out
of
the
fridge
no
big
deal
just
bad
form
victory
can
do
much
better
than
this
did
they
forget
an
addition
of
bittering
hops
this
beer
was
recently
added
to
the
taps
at
my
local
bar
and
i
felt
adventurous
last
evening
so
i
took
a
pint
of
victorys
monkey
now
to
preface
this
was
my
first
tripel
and
i
may
not
have
the
right
idea
of
what
one
should
be
but
i
will
review
the
beer
as
a
beer
and
not
as
an
interpretation
of
a
style
the
color
is
not
surprisingly
a
bright
yellowgolden
that
is
topped
by
a
head
of
white
lace
first
smell
is
of
faint
alcohol
and
fruit
the
taste
is
interesting
there
is
a
certain
bit
of
malt
to
it
and
flavors
of
clove
and
light
citrus
with
banana
as
the
most
prevalent
fruit
the
finish
is
dry
and
alcoholic
spicy
and
almost
sour
now
i
keep
mentioning
the
alcohol
content
but
while
drinking
this
it
never
detracted
from
the
beer
it
is
very
well
masked
behind
a
well
structured
arrangement
of
sweetness
and
spice
and
everything
nice
ha
ha
i
would
certainly
try
this
again
and
the
style
is
intriguing
to
say
the
least
a
few
sips
into
it
and
its
girth
announces
itself
painting
suddenly
seems
more
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
accessible
belgian
style
beer
and
i
must
remember
to
suggest
it
to
friends
who
are
willing
to
make
the
step
high
marks
for
drinkability
considering
the
high
alcohol
with
the
deceptively
hefty
alcohol
level
and
the
pile
of
residual
sweetness
victory
must
pack
the
kettle
with
sugars
for
this
brew
and
the
sweet
spiciness
in
the
finish
makes
this
massive
beer
dangerously
refreshing
mmm
danger
the
monkey
is
cloyingly
sweet
and
will
make
you
drunker
then
a
monkey
before
you
know
it
and
from
there
a
bit
of
a
what
i
think
about
the
good
but
somewhat
over
the
top
beer
the
monkey
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
head
the
flairs
up
for
a
few
seconds
but
descends
to
nothing
but
a
ring
around
the
color
lace
the
smell
is
of
a
carnival
full
of
funnel
cake
sugar
and
cotton
candy
downright
sweet
to
the
nostrils
and
will
bring
you
right
back
to
your
childhood
of
riding
unsafe
rides
at
the
county
fair
the
initial
taste
surprisingly
is
not
sweet
but
more
of
a
dry
pepper
then
that
where
that
ends
and
it
takes
you
on
the
roller
coaster
of
sickeningly
sweet
which
by
the
way
isnt
a
bad
thing
to
me
malts
and
slight
hint
of
honey
on
bread
this
beer
more
so
then
any
other
reminds
me
of
my
childhood
of
going
to
the
fair
and
eating
crap
foods
and
thus
is
overly
drinkable
and
will
remind
you
of
your
job
in
morning
when
you
walk
in
there
with
a
head
split
and
kidneys
of
stone
good
beer
none
the
less
drink
it
and
remember
some
past
times
even
though
you
wont
remember
what
happened
the
night
you
drank
it

beware

golden

is
an
excellent

at

have
some
flaws
however
plenty
good
try
one
pours
a
nicy
deep

with
a
nice

a
very
good
beer
from
victoryimpressive
maltiness
in
the
ending
on
this
onepretty
complex
this
has
been
quite
an
inconsistant
beer
for
me
if
enjoyed
sometimes
other
times
it
just
didnt
seem
like
the
same
beer
this
was
a
great
time
and
how
im
sure
the
guys
at
victory
intended
it
to
be
hazy
gold
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
eventually
diminishes
into
nothing
aroma
is
spicy
with
what
seems
like
a
bananna
flavor
i
usally
dont
associate
with
the
style
but
is
welcomed
here
anyway
there
are
so
many
tastes
in
this
beer
but
overall
it
is
quite
spicy
in
character
with
some
alcohol
a
very
very
complex
beer
a
little
too
wild
for
a
tripel
in
my
opinion
hardly
the
aromatic
beast
i
was
kind
of
expecting
the
aromas
present
were
a
spicy
orangeish
alcohol
angel
food
cake
with
lemon
icing
kind
of
exotic
but
not
nearly
enough
of
it
the
flavor
is
a
bit
onesided
not
really
pushing
my
tongue
around
at
all
i
think
perhaps
the
big
nature
of
this
beer
with
all
its
alcohol
and
fruity
malty
sweetness
demands
a
bit
more
of
a
peppery
hoppy
kick
at
the
end
its
there
but
it
could
be
bigger
regardless
its
very
delightful
and
its
size
makes
up
for
its
lack
of
complexity
highly
drinkable
despite
the
big
9
5
pretty
damn
good
this
isnt
a
great
tripel
but
with
its
wide
availability
around
here
certainly
is
more
than
a
decent
one
i
think
if
victory
tinkers
with
the
recipe
a
bit
more
they
could
have
a
real
winner
on
their
hands
a
very
good
appearance
and
a
nicely
complex
flavor
the
golden
monkey
is
a
very
solid
ale
that
tastes
as
good
as
it
looks
the
golden
hue
is
slightly
cloudy
giving
the
appearance
of
great
substance
the
clovish
flavor
immediately
gives
you
a
sweet
spice
sense
while
the
thin
ivorycolored
head
dissipates
and
leaves
minimal
amounts
of
lace
the
nose
is
light
but
gives
off
hints
of
its
malt
base
along
with
bits
of
fruit
and
spiciness
very
smooth
and
rich
body
leaves
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
to
cap
the
experience
a
memorable
brew
with
high
alcohol
contnet
great
beer
and
thanks
gavage
for
the
recommendation
the
clerk
i
bought
this
from
was
a
fairly
big
guy
but
he
made
sure
to
warn
me
about
the
monkey
and
i
can
see
why
a
bit
too
drinkable
and
smooth
for
the
octane
level
this
tripel
is
a
triple
all
right
it
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
some
light
spicesa
little
apple
and
citrus
thrown
in
the
taste
though
is
wildmuch
more
potent
than
the
smell
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
buzzing
all
over
the
place
which
pushes
powerfully
through
the
finish
wow
im
not
sure
ive
figured
it
out
yet
whatever
this
is
not
a
brew
to
be
taken
lightly
the
mouthfeel
is
thinly
seductive
ill
need
to
have
another
but
not
tonight
the
color
was
a
spot
on
deep
gold
little
to
no
aroma
stiff
malt
backbone
with
delicately
balanced
hopping
a
bit
of
cloviness
plus
a
significant
but
not
overbearing
alcohol
contribution
that
just
made
you
want
to
dance
drink
my
monkey
this
is
a
solid
attempt
from
victory
but
falls
a
little
short
of
the
leaders
in
the
class
on
almost
every
point
appearance
is
one
of
the
biggest
downers
and
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
i
still
order
this
occasionally
but
would
prefer
a
true
belgian
to
victorys
offering
the
flavor
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
white
beer
like
celis
but
it
is
a
strong
ale
it
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
i
am
sure
glad
that
it
is
now
readily
available
in
southern
california
another
fine
beer

an
elegant

the

warm

and
a

feel
is
full
bodied
and
solid
one
hell
of
great
offering
of
the
style
impressive
admittedly
i
am
relatively
new
to
this
style
so
trippel
lovers
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
i
suppose
but
this
is
really
an
addictive
beer
or
perhaps
thats
the
high
alcohol
content
talking
but
on
to
the
review
it
pours
a
very
nice
deep
reddish
gold
in
color
and
leaves
less
of
a
head
than
the
weiss
beers
i
typically
drink
not
much
laceing
either
but
the
proof
is
in
the
very
smooth
taste
that
goes
down
quite
easily
a
very
fine
beer
that
defiitely
whet
my
appetite
for
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
ale
definitely
one
for
those
who
think
they
dont
like
belgian
beer
my
first
belgian
style
trippel
that
i
had
toward
the
beginning
of
my
journey
into
the
realm
of
beer
now
i
approach
the
mystic
monkey
once
again
a
more
disciplined
deciple
pours
a
vibrant
drop
of
sunshine
golden
with
a
white
highly
carbonated
quickly
dissipating
head
very
alcoholic
nose
with
fruit
esters
honey
and
cloves
contains
a
sharp
sweetness
that
tickles
the
nose
taste
is
spiced
up
quite
a
bit
very
unique
banana
esters
in
the
flavor
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
a
very
alcoholic
finish
this
in
my
opinion
is
one
of
the
most
unique
offerings
from
victory
pretty
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
but
i
would
tend
to
stick
with
something
a
little
more
quaffable
decent
head
decent
lace
with
a
definite
nose
of
sugar
honey
cloves
bits
of
banana
and
bubble
gum

all
typical
tripel
or
strong
golden
ale
characteristics
but
none
of
were
as
crisp
or
fresh
as
the
more
classic
examples
in
nose
and
taste
it
seemd
more
rounded
and
flat
than
a
typical
sharp
trippel
kinda
like
how
a
soda
is
sweet
a
creamy
taste
but
a
bit
wheatier
than
normal
softly
hopped
with
a
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
is
a
good
try
at
a
class
style
but
does
not
match
as
well
with
the
westmalle
standard
too
clean
soft
and
rather
simple
regardless
a
great
beer
to
woo
newbies
especially
the
ladies
with
one
of
the
better
triples
on
the
east
coast
i
would
not
classify
this
as
a
strong
pale
ale

man
more
like

this
beer
has
a
lot
of
sediment
in
it
hazy
golden
in
color
with
a
head
that
is
wispy
thin
but
surprisingly
persistant
aroma
is
bready
with
hints
of
orange
and
floral
hops
flavor
begins
with
a
wonderful
coriander
spiciness
and
a
really
terrific
floral
hop
flavor
it
then
gives
way
to
a
sweet
bready
somewhat
sugary
body
with
a
big
herbal
spiciness
finishes
dry
but
gives
way
to
a
lingering
sweet
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
tasting
very
assertive
beer
not
the
most
complex
belgian
golden
but
leaves
a
strong
impression
and
is
enjoyable
nevertheless
footnote
i
was
so
taken
by
this
brew
on
our
first
introduction
that
i
put
it
on
the
list
at
my
restaurantbar
one
of
the
musicians
in
our
tuesday
night
band
last
summer
had
a
serious
monkey
fetish
tied
into
the
hundredth
monkey
concept
on
one
tune
he
made
monkey
sounds
this
was
the
beer
for
him
and
when
one
woman
asked
a
bartender
for
our
sweetest
beer
sweet
malt
grapes
although
i
could
see
myself
in

just

good
of
a

as
victory
is
some
are
just
clean
overall
not
bad
feel
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
i
would
like
flavors
to
stick
around
a
bit
longer
this
beer
could
be
more
smooth
as
well
overall
good
on
sam
adams
for
delivering
a
good
example
of
this
style
was
hoping
the
belgian
yeast
was
more
prominent
as
well
i
was
hoping
this
brew
would
of
showcased
more
of
the
oak
flavours
terrible
beer
it
was
a
drain
pour
sadly
good
belgium
style
tripel
not
better
than
actual
belgium
trappist
though
solid
deal
when
buying
barrel
room
set
of
3
from
costco
very
balanced
and
easy
drink
will
continue
to
buy
but
not
my
goto
beer
great
taste
loved
the
fruit
notes
i
was
getting
off
both
the
taste
and
smell
the
nose
is
not
strong
as
many
triples
but
the
flavour
makes
up
for
it
containing
the
familiar
banana
notes
combined
with
toffee
and
a
sour
under
note
for
the
price
this
is
a
remarkable
deal
and
enjoyable
drink
overall
a
solid
beer
though
not
at
all
superior
to
victory
golden
monkey
which
is
a
cheaper
and
very
very
similar
ale
next
time
i
throw
down

on
a

ale
it
will
be
for
la
chouffe
not
this
one
still
all
in
all
a
good
beer
worth
a
try
notes
i
held
this
one
last
of
the
barrel
room
collection
because
i
thought
that
i
may
enjoy
it
best
again
my
favorite
style
is
tripel
and
i
was
not
disappointed
ok

wasnt
really
for

wouldnt

instead
way
better
than
this
offering
this
beer
was
drinkable
but
way
better
trippels
out
there
i
was
kinda
sad
too
since
i
had
it
straight
from
the
source
looks
and
feels
like
a
tripel
it
has
a
dull
overly
sweet
aroma
without
eliciting
any
particular
flavors
it
may
become
more
complex
with
aging
but
my
initial
impression
is
not
a
good
one
its
hard
to
think
of
sam
adams
as
a
microbrewer
anymore
but
they
make
some
good
beers
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
come
across
this
one
and
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
it
checks
all
the
boxes
looks
great
nice
big
foamy
head
with
good
lacing
perfect
mouthfeel
great
flavor
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
just
a
very
nice
beer
drank
from
bottle
remarks
best
sammy
adams
ive
ever
had
pears
apples
spicy
hops
and
alcohol
a
very
good
beer
on
a
cold
november
day
an
excellent
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
quality
here
is
enormous
its
rich
smooth
creamy
beer
with
a
vibrant
belgian
yeast
strain
and
a
ton
of
grain
character
at
its
base
but
for
my
palate
it
was
too
sweet
to
drink
much
of
although
that
doesnt
at
all
diminish
my
appreciation
for
it
hazy
blonde
obviously
viscous
but
also
supremely
well
carbonated
amassing
a
several
inches
high
white
impenetrable
head
on
top
the
nose
and
taste
show
a
ton
of
candy
sugar
left
over
oats
in
the
body
and
the
oak
adding
a
vanilla
and
pear
sweetness
to
this
thing
its
sweet
double
jeopardy
but
i
still
dig
it
for
being
as
enormous
as
it
is
and
not
showing
its
booze
for
bringing
oak
into
the
fold
so
well
and
for
offering
a
beer
this
good
at
such
a
fair
price
round
in
feel
huge
body
sticky
sweet
but
its
aided
in
drinkability
by
all
the
bubbles
wheat
is
fresh
yeast
is
amazingly
bold
in
flavor
and
capacity
to
survive
the
potential
energy
of
this
thing
and
expressive
in
a
new
way
for
a
belgian
tripel
while
not
my
personal
favorite
i
really
admire
this
beer
and
indeed
this
entire
barrel
room
project
from
sam
adams
o
quite
nice
i
like
the
yeastiness
and
the
spice
is
nice
albeit
maybe
a
little
on
the
strong
side
and
the
sweetness
finishes
a
bit
strong
for
me
but
im
just
being
overly
critical
its
tasty
and
rich
but
might
be
better
in
my
opinion
if
it
were
toned
down
just
a
scosche
maybe
9
5
so
much
flavor
so
much
pigeons
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
its
the
most
enjoyable
brew
ive
ever
tasted
from
bbc
two
thumbs
up
coppery
gold
mostly
clear
liquid
that
starts
out
with
a
frothy
white
head
which
fades
after
a
few
minutes
the
smell
is
quite
fruity
most
of
that
citrus
with
some
yeast
and
other
esters
in
there
as
well
im
also
getting
some
slight
bready
malt
but
really
no
indications
of
hops
or
the
alcohol
which
makes
up
a
good
portion
of
this
the
taste
is
very
peppery
spicy
and
citrusy
just
what
id
expect
to
find
in
a
tripel
id
say
that
this
beer
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
maybe
more
fruity
than
some
other
good
examples
of
the
style
the
alcohol
flavors
are
pretty
well
hidden
but
a
nice
warming
character
definitely
starts
to
make
itself
known
especially
as
the
beer
warms
a
surprisingly
tasty
tripel
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
and
would
would
recommend
it
very
sweet
very
mild
hops
spice
tangerine
red
grape
oak
dried
fig
clove
a
bit
too
sweet
but
very
delicious
near
perfection
for
a
tripel
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
was
shocked
to
discover
sam
adams
even
outclassed
st
bernardus
tripel
this
is
truly
as
close
as
a
tripel
can
get
to
perfect
for
me
awesome
best
beer
i
have
had
by
sam
adams
i
could
only
obtain
it
from
the
brewery
in
boston
well
worth
packing
it
in
luggage
to
get
it
back
to
chicago
fantastic
belgian
yeast
flavors
and
a
kickin
abv
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
offering
from
samuel
adams
and
a
real
treat
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
in
their
entire
line
up
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
a
nice
tripel
that
so
far
stands
out
in
my
experience
with
the
barrel
room
collection
fruity
and
spicy
with
a
nice
color
good
flavor
comes
through
though
as
the
beer
warms
i
noticed
it
seems
to
get
a
little
sweeter
which
i
dont
care
for
in
this
style
smooth
foamy
maybe
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
but
really
very
decent
not
enough
flavours
i
really
like
although
the
balance
overall
is
fairly
decent
to
date
this
is
easily
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
the
boston
beer
co
what
makes
it
so
impressive
is
its
incredible
balance
well
masked
alcohol
profile
and
complex
hit
to
the
taste
buds
next
time
you
see
this
dont
shy
away
from
this
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
samuel
adams
its
a
brilliant
beer
that
must
be
experienced
the
beer
pours
a
decent
amount
of
white
and
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
dark
copper
that
looks
very
nice
but
does
not
quite
seem
to
match
the
style
the
beer
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beer
has
a
very
fruity
and
herbal
smell
the
fruit
smell
is
very
tropical
with
hints
of
lime
and
bits
of
banana
and
strawberry
there
also
bready
yeast
notes
the
beer
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
the
same
tropical
fruit
notes
such
as
lime
banana
and
strawberry
mixed
with
bready
yeast
the
taste
also
has
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
has
biting
carbonation
and
smooth
feel
overall
a
decent
beer
overall
a
rather
thicker
and
fruity
triple
certainly
not
a
bad
brew
to
try
and
one
i
think
most
would
enjoy

really
good
o
samuel
adams
new
world
tripel
is
a
beer
to
behold
its
rare
to
come
across
a
stateside
belgian
style
tripel
that
can
hang
with
the
classics
but
this
does
it
and
more
its
aromatic
and
complex
aroma
leads
right
into
the
delicious
flavor
finishing
out
with
incredible
smoothness
that
begs
to
be
sipped
time
and
time
again
truly
a
classic
edit
i
think
this
beer
would
really
shine
if
the
sweetness
was
balanced
with
sourness
also
the
oakaging
needs
to
be
ramped
up
it
was
detectable
only
after
suggestion
just
a
really
good
tripel
i
would
have
it
again
for
sure
once
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
compared
to
that
aroma
yeah
its
fruit
but
theres
also
a
dominant
bitterness
and
it
betrays
its
10
abv
which
is
not
to
say
this
isnt
a
fine
tripel
its
especially
good
considering
it
comes
from
a
macrobrewery
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
of
tropical
fruit
sweet
candycaramel
flavors
and
it
has
the
best
yeast
flavors
ive
ever
had
in
such
a
large
scale
brew
but
tripel
is
a
style
with
some
serious
competition
and
this
just
isnt
anywhere
close
to
the
top
in
that
regard
good
thing
for
the
boston
beer
co
beer
isnt
a
competition
o
a
strong
tripel
that
is
flavorful
aromatic
and
complex
this
is
an
ok
tripel
but
there
are
too
many
good
and
great
tripels
to
get
this
again
overall
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
could
see
this
being
one
of
my
go
to
beers
and
with
a
10abv
its
an
ass
kicker
o
this
is
a
tripel
but
definitely
not
like
a
typical
belgian
tripel
the
aromas
and
flavors
of
a
typical
belgian
are
all
present
but
then
the
oak
character
from
being
barrel
aged
kicks
this
into
a
different
level
in
a
good
way
excellent
bottle
cheers
o
if
you
like
belgians
this
is
a
beer
you
have
to
try
its
very
multidimensional
with
a
lot
of
layered
flavors
but
make
no
bones
about
it
its
a
belgian
beer
i
like
the
fruity
sweetness
that
is
well
balanced
with
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
o
a
great
tripel
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
like
the
admixture
of
oak
in
this
one
i
think
most
beers
do
better
with
a
bit
of
oak
very
drinkable
a
good
american
version
of
a
tripel
overall
a
very
nice
americanized
attempt
at
this
style
well
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
fairly
solid
stuff
ive
had
tripels
that
are
almost
undrinkable
because
of
the
solvent
booze
and
this
is
certainly
better
crafted
than
they
are
this
is
smooth
for
the
most
part
and
relatively
drinkable
not
something
id
particular
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
but
certainly
something
worth
trying
once
drinkability
is
pretty
high
if
you
like
a
nice
fruity
tripel
which
i
do
just
dry
and
pithy
enough
to
be
legit
and
the
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
well
done
d
this
was
a
great
tripel
but
had
almost
no
barrel
character
the
scent
and
taste
were
delicate
and
delicious
and
the
body
was
just
right
the
finish
was
really
smooth
with
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
super
easy
to
drink
probably
best
fresh
very
nice
brew
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
rocky
bone
white
head
that
persists
forever
aromas
of
light
pepper
and
spice
with
a
bit
of
honey
and
light
sugary
malt
to
back
it
up
wow
thats
sweeter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
light
sugar
and
tart
pomme
fruit
with
lots
of
spices
to
counter
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
lightly
sweet
bubbly
carbonic
acid
bite
in
the
mouthfeel
decent
brew
not
really
my
kind
of
triple
but
nice
to
try
o
i
give
sam
adams
a
lot
of
credit
im
a
big
fan
of
theirs
but
i
honestly
wasnt
expecting
this
beer
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
very
good
belgian
all
the
fruitiness
and
spiciness
you
expect
from
one
without
being
over
the
top
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
any
belgian
brew
fan
o
pleasantly
surprised
overall
a
nice
well
done
tripel
good
slight
oak
character
but
its
lacking
a
little
something
that
i
cant
quite
figure
out
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
it
might
lack
complexity
but
its
certainly
a
worthwhile
intro
tripel
that
captures
the
essence
of
the
style
o
best
one
of
the
brc
that
ive
had
like
the
character
of
this
one
its
a
big
beer
though
high
c
whoa
serious
tripel
cork
was
one
of
the
most
difficult
ever
had
a
good
pop
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
large
thick
foamy
creamcolored
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
lots
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
a
volatile
blend
of
malt
fruit
spice
hop
flavor
is
like
nose
mildly
sweet
with
good
carbonic
tang
and
a
little
bitter
to
balance
very
nicely
body
is
full
and
is
dominated
by
fine
sparkling
wine
style
carbonation
that
adds
an
elegant
dimension
finish
is
like
flavor
fairly
long
has
some
alcohol
warmth
and
is
a
true
pleasure
to
sip
a
masterpiece
be
fun
to
cook
with
if
i
didnt
drink
it
all
a
better
tripel
than
some
domestic
versions
ive
tried
but
im
not
in
too
big
of
a
hurry
to
buy
this
again
serving
type
bottle
hope
to
update
soon
this
is
a
fine
tripel
for
those
interested
in
something
traditional
tasting
but
also
really
amped
up
really
huge
an
interesting
tripel
o
ive
heard
that
this
is
a
pretty
respectable
beer
but
this
did
not
withstand
the
test
of
time
at
all
wild
yeasts
or
bugs
intentional
or
not
really
took
this
beer
in
the
wrong
direction
at
this
point
its
more
like
a
very
mediocre
wild
ale
an
a
triple
i
bought
a
750ml
bottle
from
wegmans
for
9
99
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
tripel
by
sam
adams
it
had
slightly
more
hoppy
bitterness
and
alcohol
taste
than
i
would
have
liked
but
it
also
has
some
nice
fruity
and
spicy
cloves
notes
overall
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
there
are
much
better
tripels
available
with
a
lower
price
tag
at
the
same
store
so
i
doubt
i
will
try
it
again
had
on
tap
today
at
hops
burger
bar
here
in
gso
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
hazed
lighter
amber
with
a
tightly
formed
large
head
that
never
completely
settled
candied
sugar
and
very
mild
spiced
phenols
in
the
nose
alot
of
candied
sugar
on
the
palatesome
lefay
hops
and
spiced
phenols
make
for
a
bold
flavor
profile
this
beer
is
pretty
big
and
bold
even
for
the
styleits
not
a
style
i
go
to
often
but
once
in
awhile
a
beer
like
this
is
nice
to
sip
on
in
an
empty
bar
easily
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
beers
ive
ever
had
there
are
no
complaints
on
this
beer
truly
a
tripel
that
even
a
belgian
could
be
proud
to
drink
certainly
has
some
unique
american
features
but
they
hit
this
out
of
the
park
the
packaging
the
bottle
is
super
cool
the
price
is
right
overall
overall
not
too
bad
there
are
much
better
tripels
out
there
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
strong
with
some
bozzy
after
taste
that
doesnt
put
me
off
though
i
know
a
lot
dont
like
that
a
lot
of
fruit
first
banana
then
a
but
if
citrus
i
got
a
bit
of
earthy
notes
though
im
pretty
sure
theres
no
brettanomyces
used
in
the
brew
all
in
all
a
likable
ale
ill
pick
up
a
couple
more
bottles
before
theyre
gone
i
wonder
how
they
will
age
very
nice
head
and
very
fine
lacing
head
is
about
3
fingers
the
smell
is
appealing
and
very
tropical
fruit
nuance
pineapple
seems
to
predominate
the
taste
starts
off
very
smooth
and
appealingbut
soons
turns
sour
rather
than
bitter
some
people
may
like
thisbut
i
consider
this
a
fault
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbut
slightly
hothowever
not
off
putting
except
for
the
sournessi
would
have
rated
this
much
higherif
not
for
the
sourness
i
can
see
drinking
this
new
world
beer
in
another
world
sitting
on
a
beach
listening
to
jimmy
buffet
i
may
be
back
soon
to
grab
more
of
the
remaining
stock
of
this
one
as
i
suspect
we
are
in
limited
edition
territory
here
d
as
a
lover
of
both
tripels
and
barrel
aged
offerings
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
booziness
which
isnt
off
the
charts
is
strong
enough
to
obscure
the
rest
of
this
brew
looks
and
smells
decent
stumbles
a
bit
in
terms
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
overall
result
is
a
resounding
meh
sorry
samuel
adams
but
i
hope
the
rest
of
teh
barrel
room
collection
is
a
notch
or
two
above
this
one
o
overall
not
bad
the
apparent
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
off
putting
but
it
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
this
is
the
2nd
beer
from
the
barrel
aged
collection
that
i
have
had
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
13th
hour
had
more
going
on
the
smell
of
this
new
world
triple
is
somewhat
plainer
than
the
other
not
to
say
that
this
one
is
bad
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
more
mild
this
one
is
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
warmness
brought
on
by
the
10abv
there
some
mango
and
spices
mixed
in
here
maybe
apricot
reminds
me
a
lot
of
dried
fruits
makes
me
want
to
try
others
in
this
collection
when
i
can
find
them
absolutely
brilliant
looking
beer
glowing
orangegold
with
a
huge
head
of
dense
white
foam
that
really
never
recedes
and
lays
down
thick
streaks
of
foam
on
the
glass
aroma
is
rather
muted
faint
alcohol
esters
palate
opens
up
orchard
fruits
mild
spice
rosewater
bit
of
vanilla
on
top
of
a
clean
crackery
malt
base
mild
herbal
hoppiness
the
smoothness
at
10
is
pretty
remarkable
and
its
well
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
just
needs
more
expressive
flavors
and
where
is
the
oak
overall
an
excellent
brew
but
it
offers
little
over
duvel
which
is
much
easier
to
obtain
and
easier
to
open
a
damn
fine
trippel
more
than
i
expected
from
this
to
be
honest
really
very
good
definitely
worth
trying
and
perhaps
one
of
the
best
american
attempts
at
this
style
i
have
had
the
look
and
feel
is
still
there
very
reminecient
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
barrel
room
beer
13th
hour
the
quality
is
that
good
i
just
simply
dont
like
whats
being
attempted
but
have
no
problems
with
the
execution
o
great
offering
by
sam
adams
not
sure
if
i
like
it
better
than
13th
hour
but
it
is
definitely
just
as
unique
and
interesting
o
a
good
beer
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
a
little
bit
pricey
for
what
you
get
i
think
there
are
better
tripels
out
there
for
a
better
price
a
tasty
brew
but
i
wont
necessarily
seek
it
out
the
taste
follows
the
nose
peppery
spice
sweetness
tropical
citrus
mango
pineapples
banana
sweet
and
complex
the
oak
is
very
subdued
however
but
this
is
such
a
delicious
offering
form
sam
adams
that
i
am
very
impressed
with
how
well
this
is
crafted
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
was
amazed
that
i
was
able
to
buy
this
for
4
49
i
am
definitely
going
to
get
some
more
of
these
to
enjoy
overall
a
decent
tripel
for
the
price
cosidering
i
got
it
for
6
49
on
sale
not
quite
as
good
as
its
belgianmade
counterparts
but
it
stands
up
well
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
was
great
to
start
off
the
super
bowl
beer
lineup
2013
mar
13
orange
gold
color
small
head
aroma
and
flavors
of
bubblegum
orange
zest
sweet

slight
alcohol
flavors
are
similar
to
what
i
reported
before
with
more
carbonation
sweetness
herbs
and
funky
fruit
rind
darn
tasty
but
still
not
in
my
top
5
tripels
pours
a
pure
golden
orange
and
is
topped
with
a
dense
majestic
offwhite
head
that
seems
to
deem
diminution
as
defeat
a
sweet
malty
aroma
is
followed
by
allspice
a
bit
of
earthy
funk
an
array
of
light
fruits
green
apples
oranges
pears
and
taffy
tastes
sweet
and
fruity
with
an
oaken
edge
toward
the
end
subsequent
draws
from
the
glass
reveal
a
low
chalkiness
and
a
bitter
denouement
a
creamy
middle
with
dry
edges
results
in
a
smooth
but
interesting
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
blended
to
the
point
of
near
invisibility
at
one
point
the
tripel
was
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
quickly
propels
it
back
to
that
position
for
the
time
being
anyway
the
age
did
this
guy
well
wet
damp
funk
is
prevalent
and
very
welcome
soft
tripel
notes
throughout
i
am
going
to
have
to
seek
out
a
fresh
bottle
for
comparisons
sake
a
nice
trippel
from
samuel
adams
not
quiet
a
true
trappist
trippel
but
its
touching
the
surface
a
little
overpriced
but
life
is
too
short
to
drink
cheap
beer
pours
hay
color
in
body
with
large
white
head
that
stays
around

of
candy
sugar
booze
honey

of

little

light
tropical

reminiscent
of

some

sneaks
in
toward
the
finish
light
in
body
with
high
carbonation
a
bit
sticky
on
the
palate
alcohol
coats
the
tongue
sweet
and
very
refined
for
such
a
high
abv
o
this
was
a
good
example
of
a
triple
not
the
best
and
not
the
worst
i
wild
prefer
soemething
more
along
the
lines
of
allagash
tripel
but
overall
a
good
effort
750

to
a

that
is

alcohol
is
very
well

with
hardly
any

noticed
after
the

overall
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
style
very
nice
flavor
complexity
and
balance
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
ultimately
this
borders
on
undrinkable
maybe
i
can
mix
it
with
a
flabby
witbier
from
the
500
ml
bottle
bought
at
barons
marketplace
in
san
diego
this
beer
smells
delicious
very
good
flavors
awesome
yeast
strain
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
tripel
but
there
is
an
underlying
dryness
and
is
tasty
nonetheless
the
color
when
poured
was
a
light
golden
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
also
two
fingers
of
tight
white
foam
and
plenty
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
tulip
glass
the
aroma
was
of
spices
fruit
with
a
hint
of
herbal
notes
the
taste
of
carbonated
fruit
spices
was
very
pleasant
without
the
alcohol
over
powering
this
this
fantastic
golden
tripel
first
of
several
bottles
bought
as
part
of
gift
from
dad
many
thanks
overall
i
love
this
beer
ive
tried
most
of
the
barrel
room
collection
and
so
far
this
is
still
my
favorite
i
am
seriously
considering
buying
several
and
letting
them
age
see
if
it
can
gets
better
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
the
best
tripel
by
any
stretch
the
funky
character
is
nice
but
its
a
little
too
quiet
the
oak
doesnt
come
through
at
all
and
i
just
dont
get
barrel
aged
funky
tripel
from
it
maybe
my
expectations
were
a
little
high
seeing
as
how
ive
loved
the
other
two
ive
had
from
this
series
overall
one
of
the
better
tripels
i
have
had
good
brew
overall
this
is
a
superbly
crafted
and
blended
beer
that
benefits
well
from
its
time
in
the
barrels
and
hides
the
high
alcohol
content
quite
well
some
may
find
the
oak
nuance
to
be
too
subtle
but
i
found
that
it
was
just
enough
to
influence
the
beer
very
positively
and
in
several
key
aspects
of
the
drinking
process
you
get
it
a
bit
in
the
smell
a
bit
in
the
initial
taste
a
bit
in
the
middle
taste
and
it
pairs
superbly
and
most
strongly
in
the
finish
with
the
great
clove
effect
overall
this
is
quite
the
aboveaverage
brew
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
any
that
enjoy
belgian
style
ales
im
a
big
fan
of
belgian
anything
particular
tripels
quads
and
other
trappist
inspired
strong
ales
so
i
was
keen
on
trying
sam
adams
version
unfortunately
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
particular
attempt
appearance
wise
the
beer
looks
great
it
pours
a
beautiful
slightly
cloudy
amber
with
a
sturdy
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
i
even
like
the
bottle
however
the
flavors
are
overly
exaggerated
it
is
overly
hopped
overly
spiced
and
overly
sweet
as
such
it
is
a
very
heavy
beer
with
a
syrupy
mouth
feel
the
strength
of
the
flavor
was
truly
pallet
killing
like
i
had
just
eaten
something
very
salty
perhaps
they
were
trying
to
mask
the
high
abv
for
a
tripel
10
indeed
the
medicinal
flavor
of
the
alcohol
is
almost
nonexistent
but
whatever
the
reason
the
result
is
an
unbalanced
pallet
killing
flavor
that
i
personally
found
more
confusing
than
complex
the
flavor
was
not
objectionable
but
it
was
definitely
hard
for
me
to
savor
and
i
like
strongly
flavored
beers
it
has
a
lightmedium
body
very
smooth
and
with
a
lingering
dryness
also
an
enjoyable
and
longlived
aftertaste
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
sip
on
since
there
is
so
much
flavor
happening
new
world
tripel
is
part
of
samuel
adams
barrel
room
collection
a
series
of
beers
made
with
sam
adams
speciallymade
wild
yeast
and
aged
in
oak
brandy
barrels
i
dont
get
much
of
this
oakbarrel
flavor
and
it
makes
me
wonder
if
the
aging
process
really
accomplished
much
either
way
still
a
crisp
and
flavorful
beer
o
very
good
tripel
worth
a
try
overall
nice
brew
dont
detect
the
barrel
aging
carbonation
is
somewhat
excitable
but
not
overexcited
making
for
a
nice
flow
and
contributing
to
a
smoothness
that
rides
well
even
with
a
strong
crispness
but
its
that
slight
maltysweet
taste
and
residual
malty
weight
that
keeps
the
ale
anchored
to
the
richer
belgianstyle
strong
pale
ales
than
it
does
a
tripel
i
need
a
drier
malt
backbone
and
more
earthen
hop
bitterness
to
qualify
as
a
strong
tripel
contender
still
the
beer
is
no
slouch
and
earns
its
spot
in
my
heart
and
in
my
glass
this
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
the
scent
is
strong
with
yeast
tropical
fruit
banana
and
bready
tones
there
is
a
really
decent
amount
of
spice
taste
that
mixes
well
with
fruit
overall
this
is
sweet
tasting
full
bodied
beer
that
really
delivers
a
quality
taste
while
filling
you
up
also
leaves
behind
great
lacing
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
other
tripels
that
i
would
pick
first
good
belgian
clone
one
of
sam
adamss
better
beers
boston
beer
company
definitely
has
a
winner
with
new
world
if
the
rest
of
the
barrel
room
collection
is
this
good
its
a
heck
of
a
series
new
worlds
not
perfect
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
belgian
yeast
thats
nitpicking
though
this
is
good
stuff
worth
checking
out
o
a
pretty
decent
tripel
overall
i
really
wish
the
flavor
had
as
much
depth
as
the
aroma
still
its
enjoyable
and
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
one
finger
puffy
head
that
has
reduced
to
a
thin
layer
and
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
it
is
a
pale
orange
color
with
great
clarity
and
bubbles
coming
up
through
the
glass
typical
triple
aromas
spices
vanilla
apple
pear
yeasty
esters
and
some
oak
the
taste
is
along
the
sane
lines
with
the
addition
of
some
tart
flavors
and
funkiness
beer
is
smooth
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
delicious
to
drink
i
have
had
this
beer
before
and
happy
to
have
shared
it
with
friends
finish
spicy
somewhat
peppery
the
alcohol
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
but
never
overpowering
a
fine
showing
smells
of
banana
papayas
starfruit
yeast
and
mediumlight
pineapple
pear
with
very
faint
clove
the
flavor
is
similar
but
has
higher
levels
of
yeastiness
much
less
banana
clove
and
pineapple
and
a
wispy
touch
of
soured
green
apple
and
just
the
barest
touch
of
oak
on
the
finish
abv
is
surprisingly
wellhidden
for
a
10
brew
once
again
i
find
myself
with
the
rare
criticism
that
the
beer
could
use
some
amplification
of
its
oak
barrel
qualities
for
a
better
balance
also
this
tripel
seems
to
have
been
aged
by
the
brewery
itself
to
the
point
where
the
alcohol
and
spice
heat
has
mellowed
out
to
my
personal
balance
preferences
meaning
that
this
is
one
of
the
very
few
tripels
on
the
market
that
i
wouldnt
cellar
its
in
my
desired
target
flavor
profile
zone
already
at
retail
well
worth
giving
a
try
very
nicely
done
here
by
sam
adams
great
version
of
a
tripel
at
an
affordable
price
and
in
a
unique
and
beautiful
bottle
good
work
by
them
enjoyable
alternative
to
the
imported
belgian
tripels
all
the
flavors
are
present
as
described
by
other
reviewers
and
i
did
get
the
clove
but
it
was
not
overwhelming
rather
i
would
call
it
interesting
overall
i
judge
this
a
very
good
american
version
of
a
belgian
beer
i
lean
toward
tripels
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
and
at
40
cheaper
than
the
imports
sam
adams
had
done
me
a
big
favor
not
to
be
ignored
the
high
abv
does
not
ruin
the
beer
nor
does
it
mask
a
delightful
finish
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
fresh
flavorful
and
decidedly
american
take
on
a
belgian
trippel
purists
and
sa
haters
will
probably
not
feel
the
same
lol
that
said
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
enjoy
this
again
way
too
much
going
on
for
this
to
be
an
every
day
beer
say
what
you
want
about
sa
they
have
some
horrible
misses
but
also
some
pretty
good
hits
this
is
one
of
them
the
cork
was
removed
with
a
loud
pop
and
lots
of
smoke
was
visible
upon
opening
poured
into
a
large
brandy
snifter
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
it
appears
to
be
wellcarbonated
due
to
many
visible
tiny
bubbles
in
the
beer
there
are
some
nice
herbal
clove
and
fruit
notes
in
the
aromas
i
pick
up
some
tropical
type
fruit
with
some
apple
and
white
grape
i
pick
up
some
of
the
malt
as
well
one
of
the
things
brought
out
in
the
flavor
is
the
solid
malt
backbone
for
this
beer
the
fruit
flavors
the
clove
and
those
herbal
notes
come
through
well
the
herbal
hop
notes
balance
the
sweet
and
bready
malts
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
lively
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
finishes
slightly
dry
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
will
not
disappoint
i
enjoyed
this
beer
thoroughly
and
i
think
you
will
too
as
much
as
i
liked
it
i
could
only
handle
maybe
two
glasses
of
this
stuff
perfect
for
a
meal
though
the
blended
samuel
adams
new
world
tripel
is
then
traditionally
bottle
conditioned
which
creates
a
final
fermentation
in
the
bottle
giving
the
beer
an
extra
smooth
and
balanced
flavor
sam
adams
new
world
quite
possibly
the
most
disappointing
beer
i
have
tasted
in
my
life
this
trippel
pours
golden
with
a
beautiful
head
and
lace
but
the
beauty
stops
there
the
aroma
is
strong
with
herbal
and
citrus
overtones
but
the
taste
is
over
the
top
in
clove
and
spice
with
a
slight
hint
of
pineapple
the
lingering
taste
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
is
comparable
to
the
after
taste
of
dental
novacaine
while
the
back
of
the
tongue
is
left
wondering
what
it
did
to
deserve
this
sa
needs
to
go
back
to
what
they
do
best
traditional
crafted
beers
poured
from
corked
and
caged
bottle
into
tulip
beer
is
amber
crystal
clear
with
aggressive
carbonation
showing
the
nose
is
ripe
mango
peach
and
vanilla
tropical
fruit
on
the
tongue
with
pepper
some
vanilla
and
a
noticeable
alcohol
presence
slick
mouthfeel
interesting
tripel
perhaps
a
tad
rough
very
foamy
head
fruity
aroma
very
sweet
up
front
not
carmely
but
more
like
apple
or
pear
or
even
more
neutral
than
that
like
honey
or
sugar
crackers
or
breadiness
kind
of
a
whitebread
belgian
straight
down
the
middle
every
other
belgian
ive
had
had
something
distinctive
about
it
this
one
is
just
a
pure
example
no
distinction
not
to
say
its
bland
just
unadorned
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
spices
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
chalky
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
with
almost
a
year
of
age
the
beer
pours
a
rich
looking
golden
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
laces
plenty
of
carbonation
and
no
hazesediment
the
nose
is
spicy
yeasty
and
has
a
big
alcoholic
bite
its
actually
quite
balanced
and
even
when
it
warms
the
nose
remains
subtle
and
pleasant
the
taste
is
sweet
and
well
balanced
with
a
lingering
bitterness
and
slight
bite
from
the
alcohol
its
better
than
expected
but
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
dryness
its
worth
the
price
and
very
easily
available
i
would
recommend
picking
this
up
and
holding
onto
it
for
a
year
or
longer
dark
gold
in
color
lots
of
effervescent
bubbles
come
up
from
the
center
the
head
is
with
with
good
retention
and
leaves
moderate
lacing
extreme
amounts
of
fruit
and
spice
in
the
nose
tropical
fruit
smacks
the
palate
with
an
awesome
clove
spiciness
lots
of
floral
notes
and
bread
as
well
the
mouth
feel
is
very
champagne
like
very
lively
im
really
impressed
with
this
one
if
you
love
tropical
fruit
give
this
one
a
shot
nice
offering
from
sa
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
really
nice
appearance
including
great
head
which
is
always
a
favorite
in
my
book
and
thick
lacing
nose
is
bready
with
spice
and
tropical
fruit
notes
flavor
follows
suit
pretty
much
tastes
like
it
smells
light
grain
tropical
fruit
and
licorice
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
feels
like
sipping
on
champagne
with
lots
of
carbonation
cleanses
the
palate
and
has
a
warm
finish
this
truly
wowed
me
glad
to
see
sam
adams
taking
a
chance
on
something
this
refreshing
now
if
only
they
could
add
this
into
their
variety
12
packs
instead
of
me
paying
10
for
a
bomber
d
the
only
complaint
i
can
come
up
with
is
that
it
finishes
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
aside
from
that
it
is
complex
and
wonderfully
fruity
with
a
rich
black
pepper
note
throughout
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
beers
ive
tasted
overall
usually
some
of
these
beers
disappoint
me
but
this
one
is
actually
very
good
with
excellent
belgian
character
without
being
too
sweet
d
pretty
easily
drinkable
hides
its
10
well
o
im
not
getting
a
lot
of
the
oakaged
characteristics
but
this
is
tasty
and
is
a
nice
domestic
take
of
the
tripel
style
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
tripple
i
hope
they
keep
this
one
around
and
maybe
do
some
six
packs
of
it
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
worthy
competitor
to
new
belgiums
trippel
this
can
sit
next
to
any
belgian
tripple
and
compare
favorably
medium
to
light
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
solid
tripel
with
some
nice
belgian
characteristics
and
a
hint
of
oak
some
barrel
aged
aspects
to
to
this
but
not
really
wowed
by
this
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
pineapple
and
tropical
fruit
notes
as
well
as
some
alcohol
white
pepper
and
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
pepper
and
fruit
notes
as
well
as
some
chewy
biscuit
malt
the
alcohol
is
also
quite
noticeable
which
is
not
a
surprise
for
a
beer
that
is
10
percent
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
oak
and
vanilla
character
hidden
in
the
background
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
well
done
beer
not
as
complex
as
others
but
really
nice
drinking
overall
sam
adams
claims
it
as
a
barrelaged
tripel
though
it
is
closer
resembling
of
a
golden
strong
ale
due
to
its
sg
and
a
slightly
dryer
crisper
finish
overall
a
pleasing
beer
if
the
opportunity
is
there
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
the
yeast
comes
through
with
some
fruit
and
and
faint
spices
the
banana
was
a
surprise
but
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
is
expected
and
doesnt
detract
from
the
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
worth
picking
up
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
massive
white
head
with
good
retention
and
tons
of
lacing
looks
good
aroma
of
sweet
malt
belgian
spices
light
stone
fruit
and
a
hint
of
caramel
flavor
is
sweet
malt
apple
juice
a
hint
of
exotic
fruit
finishing
drier
with
belgian
spicing
and
hints
of
saison
yeast
and
wood
with
faint
diacetyl
abv
is
covered
well
but
shows
up
in
the
finish
body
is
light
to
medium
slightly
light
for
a
traditional
triel
but
active
carbonation
produces
a
satisfactory
mouth
feel
tastes
somewhat
like
a
tripel
mixed
with
a
saison
interesting
take
on
the
belgian
style
o
solid
offering
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
with
good
drinkability
one
of
the
better
american
triples
i
have
had
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
the
flavors
i
associate
with
the
style
about
the
only
thing
that
i
can
complain
about
is
the
alcohol
is
not
as
well
hidden
as
in
the
best
triples
but
it
is
on
the
high
side
for
the
style
very
much
worth
trying
overall
a
good
tripel
dont
think
the
oak
actually
does
anything
for
this
beer
overall
not
bad
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
overall
i
like
this
beer
the
aroma
is
a
little
bit
unusual
for
my
taste
but
it
tastes
good
and
it
ticks
most
of
the
tripel
boxes
for
me
its
definitely
worth
having
bottle
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
ale
with
a
nice
big
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
tropical
fruit
is
quite
dominant
with
some
sweet
belgian
malt
notes
taste
is
really
dominated
by
some
notes
of
tropical
fruit
with
some
notes
of
belgian
malt
with
light
candi
sugar
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
not
bad
but
too
much
tropical
fruit
for
my
own
taste
kind
of
hard
to
figure
out
this
was
a
tripel
m
almost
medium
body
very
smooth
with
perfect
carbonation
poured
into
the
glass
the
beer
had
a
murky
light
brown
color
with
a
smooth
white
head
one
immediately
picks
up
the
belgian
yeast
in
the
aroma
giving
mild
hints
of
banana
one
is
able
to
detect
the
smooth
mouthfeel
in
the
initial
before
perceiving
the
taste
a
belgian
banana
taste
was
most
notable
though
an
alcohol
flavor
permeated
the
more
pleasant
notes
dark
fruits
and
a
slight
hint
of
malt
was
also
present
the
beer
was
warming
even
before
the
aftertaste
when
the
banana
began
to
mellow
overall
this
is
a
good
impression
of
a
tripel
in
actuality
the
taste
is
too
mild
given
a
high
degree
of
respect
overall
one
of
the
better
tripels
i
have
had
lately
i
like
this
because
it
is
not
too
boozy
or
bitter
but
still
hits
the
flavors
i
expect
in
a
tripel
i
will
look
for
this
again
pours
a
clean
deep
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
fruit
note
and
a
candy
sugar
sweetness
in
the
taste
a
small
fruitiness
and
a
bit
sweet
to
a
bigger
dry
presence
with
some
alcohol
in
the
end
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
candy
sugar
and
small
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
a
really
nice
representation
of
style
a
bit
sweet
but
very
nice
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
must
have
beer
but
it
was
different
and
good
all
of
the
while
a
group
of
us
shared
this
taste
treat
it
was
poured
into
a
sample
type
glass
it
has
a
nice
golden
straw
color
body
with
a
little
white
fizzy
head
that
disappears
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
spice
and
a
little
banana
comes
threw
the
taste
starts
off
sweetalmost
bubble
gum
then
it
gets
a
spicyclove
and
white
pepper
the
mouth
feel
is
good
overall
i
think
this
a
beer
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
i
was
glad
to
get
to
try
this
brew
a
testament
to
the
brewers
of
boston
beer
co
a
nice
little
tripel
here
with
all
the
right
notes
pretty
good
o
an
interesting
beer
that
is
certainly
worth
trying
the
medley
of
flavors
on
different
parts
of
your
palate
makes
this
a
very
interesting
drink
the
aroma
could
use
more
depth
like
the
flavor
and
less
fizz
would
help
accentuate
the
taste
profile
nice
to
try
at
least
once
especially
if
you
have
a
couple
friends
to
share
a
bottle
with
served
in
a
tulip
pours
an
orange
hue
with
a
semihazy
clarity
and
a
two
inch
rocky
white
head
some
spots
and
strands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
light
fruity
esters
candi
sugar
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
grassy
quality
taste
follows
nose
however
its
all
comes
together
a
bit
muted
theres
a
bit
of
alcohol
bite
at
the
finish
and
there
is
also
a
slight
earthiness
and
a
suggestion
of
pit
fruit
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
n
consistency
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
residual
tingle
at
the
finish
overall
a
surprisingly
solid
tripel
that
hits
all
the
style
markers
o
i
was
skeptical
when
i
bought
this
and
truth
be
told
the
bottle
sold
the
product
more
than
anyrhing
else
i
must
say
that
samuel
adams
has
done
a
great
job
at
a
traditional
belgian
style
and
i
would
put
this
as
special
beer
for
those
memorable
occasions
that
deserve
a
beer
of
this
caliber
though
i
would
be
a
liar
if
i
would
tell
you
it
tops
a
westmalle
chimay
affilgem
or
a
slew
of
other
true
belgian
triples
but
non
the
less
kudos
to
the
boston
beer
co
for
a
damn
fine
triple
o
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
beers
that
i
have
had
it
seems
like
this
barrel
room
collection
is
significantly
better
than
the
classic
products
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
though
not
a
session
beer
i
love
these
bottle
on
these
new
samuel
adams
barrel
room
beers
the
beer
is
a
completely
transparent
golden
effervescent
liquid
the
head
is
small
nearly
disparaging
after
the
pour
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
the
aroma
its
a
spice
and
sugar
smell
a
bit
of
pale
malt
and
some
tropical
fruit
and
bubblegum
its
interesting
but
a
little
too
quiet
the
taste
however
is
nice
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
background
of
spice
and
hard
candy
yeast
and
some
warmth
relatively
full
and
carbonic
mouthfeel
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
it
really
didnt
wow
me
o
overall
a
very
bright
and
sharp
flavor
wise
with
a
good
spicy
and
fruit
laced
alcohol
presence
good
use
of
belgian
yeast
which
is
well
defined
and
a
strong
effervesce
brings
a
tight
crispness
to
the
table
a
gentle
warm
glow
of
alcohol
finishes
things
out
i
would
revisit
this
again
very
nice
indeed
id
serve
this
with
some
nice
quebec
farmhouse
cheese
oa
really
good
beer
i
was
a
little
worried
going
into
this
because
of
some
of
the
other
boston
beer
company
specialty
beers
but
this
one
was
on
point
well
done
most
american
tripels
are
belgian
in
character
only
in
the
same
way
that
the
olive
garden
is
italian
everything
about
samuel
adams
new
world
tripel
however
is
unequivocally
old
world
it
is
malty
and
phenolic
quaffable
yet
complicated
boastful
yet
refined
it
is
in
truth
pretty
much
all
you
could
ask
for
in
a
tripel
and
it
deserves
a
lot
of
lovin
strong
aroma
is
crisp
fruity
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
butterscotch
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
bite
it
pours
a
beautiful
bubbly
clear
amber
with
a
very
thick
and
fluffy
white
head
crisp
mouthfilling
flavor
has
a
firm
fruity
component
that
is
mainly
apple
with
a
note
of
banana
along
with
butterscotch
and
malty
notes
a
hint
of
caramel
and
an
alcohol
bite
that
gets
your
attention
without
being
fierce
fullbodied
texture
has
a
fair
amount
of
fizz
and
leaves
a
crisp
fruity
malty
finish
go
patriots
new
world
tripel
comes
from
the
samuel
adams
barrel
room
collection
and
makes
it
way
to
the
consumer
in
a
barrelshaped
bottle
the
brew
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
rocky
white
head
that
eventually
settles
down
and
provides
a
solid
lace
a
lemony
spritziness
intermingles
with
hints
of
clove
spiciness
and
a
little
funk
from
the
belgian
yeast
very
slight
malt
tones
are
backed
by
tropical
fruitiness
spice
and
yeast
a
high
level
of
carbonation
is
met
with
a
medium
body
in
this
very
good
tripel
possibly
the
best
beer
we
have
enjoyed
from
the
boston
beer
company
m
medium
body
smooth
and
creamy
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
sweet
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
very
fruity
belgian
yeast
character
im
not
getting
much
oak
aroma
but
the
esters
may
be
drowning
it
out
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
with
excellent
yeast
notes
and
bit
of
oak
character
in
the
finish
its
an
easy
drinker
even
at
10
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
delicious
beer
its
about
as
easy
a
drinking
belgian
tripel
as
ive
ever
tried
o
a
delicious
tripel
i
would
definitely
have
another
feels
like
a
champaigne
in
the
mouth
slightly
dry
with
a
low
density
froth
with
large
bubbles
overall
this
really
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
yes
it
may
come
off
light
to
some
but
it
is
very
tasty
towards
the
end
the
taste
of
alchohol
for
a
10
abv
level
beer
is
not
quickly
evident
when
you
drink
it
though
you
will
definitely
feel
it
i
like
it
and
personally
i
think
most
true
beer
connoisseurs
will
agree
cheers
to
all
its
a
tough
style
and
this
is
a
hoppy
version
of
it
i
didnt
get
much
of
the
oak
aging
from
it
still
it
went
down
well
was
enjoyable
a
unique
offering
from
sam
adams
that
is
worth
checking
out
good
stuff
from
sam
adams
would
easily
try
this
one
again
subtly
different
enough
from
a
traditional
tripel
which
alone
makes
it
a
nice
change
from
sam
adams
pretty
big
flavor
here
update
this
beer
does
not
age
well
had
a
ten
month
old
bottle
that
was
not
good
at
all
i
poured
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
clear
golden
pour
long
lasting
big
white
head
lots
of
lace
the
aroma
is

the
taste
has
light
clove

drying
finish
the
body
is
medium
high
carbonation
well
hidden
abv
i
enjoyed
this
drinks
more
like
a
strong
ale
than
a
tripel
i
did
not
notice
any
oak
not
sure
how
much
the
barrel
aging
affected
this
beer
various
ideas
that
didnt
all
hang
together
not
so
drinkable
nice
looking
sweet
spicy
taste
and
sweet
aroma
spices
not
what
i
liked
saaz
hops
did
not
do
it
for
me
its
the
style
but
it
doesnt
quite
rise
to
the
occasion
of
those
produced
in
belgium
o
passable
beer
im
not
sure
the
barrel
aging
helped
this
beer
though
may
have
detracted
a
bit
drank
it
easily
enough
but
one
ill
move
past
and
not
come
back
to
oa
decent
beer

overall
feel
really
liked
this
but
for
what
it
costs
i
would
go
for
something
else
very
good
stuff
though
very
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
if
it
werent
for
the
10
abv
i
would
throw
these
back
all
night
overall
i
think
only
my
second
or
third
barrel
aged
tripel
and
not
my
favorite
still
worthy
of
a
taste
though
as
the
tropical
fruit
is
really
nice
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
really
lingers
on
the
tongue
overall
a
very
well
done
tripel
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
still
worth
a
try
pours
an
unfiltered
hazy
tangerine
with
some
lighter
browns
throughout
creamy
retention
and
some
big
chunk
of
lace
voluminous
3
fingers
of
white
head
was
initially
produced
nose
has
some
peaches
and
mild
tropical
notes
as
the
label
suggests
some
grassy
notes
that
take
on
an
almost
herbal
character
quite
nice
and
no
real
alcohol
which
is
nice
given
the
abv
taste
is
lightly
sugary
drying
and
alcoholic
more
modest
tropical
notes
peach
tangerine
and
pineapple
a
bit
of
vanilla
with
more
of
the
herbal
saaz
returning
in
more
substantial
amounts
than
in
the
nose
a
big
rip
of
spice
in
the
finish
with
more
alcohol
active
carbonation
smooth
with
the
alcohol
being
quite
prevalent
heavy
medium
body
a
nice
tripel
but
not
substantially
complex
too
much
alcohol
for
my
liking
but
this
isnt
bad
by
any
stretch
not
sure
how
much
influence
the
barrel
aging
had
as
it
wasnt
too
evident
in
my
opinion
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
that
i
sipped
and
savoured
for
two
hours
this
is
a
complex
brew
that
was
ideal
for
the
cold
winter
night
i
drank
it
overall
this
was
a
great
tripel
ale
i
loved
how
light
and
fruity
it
was
i
am
now
in
love
with
dubels
and
tripels
i
just
now
have
to
hunt
down
a
quality
quad
and
try
that
cheers
the
flavor
starts
off
with
some
crackery
malts
which
lend
a
solid
level
of
sweetness
not
a
lot
but
something
very
much
in
line
with
the
style
fruitiness
is
pleasing
with
some
pear
green
apple
and
a
touch
of
pineapple
present
the
yeast
does
indeed
contribute
spiciness
to
the
proceedings
here
and
it
is
quite
pleasing
it
has
a
subtle
bit
of
peppery
action
present
it
is
dry
in
the
finish
and
the
oakaging
is
quite
subtle
perhaps
contributing
a
smidge
of
vanilla
the
10
abv
is
scarily
wellhidden
too
if
this
was
perhaps
in
the
6
range
it
would
be
a
frequent
guest
in
my
fridge
and
my
stomach
at
10
well
maybe
not
without
regard
to
cost
though
this
is
very
wellmade
and
quite
flavorful
prosit
1414
overall
a
nice
beer
great
effort
by
sam
adams
folks
but
thre
are
a
lot
of
better
tripels
out
there
o
i
loved
how
bbc
did
a
domestic
version
of
a
belgian
tripel
and
had
enough
of
a
twist
to
make
it
stand
out
id
hope
this
would
make
a
return
at
some
point
id
try
it
again
and
im
now
curious
as
to
the
other
barrel
room
series
beers
overall
slow
drinking
beer
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
it
is
enjoyable

i
have
to
say
really
perfectly
drinkable
and
so
balanced
spot
on
beer
and
one
the
most
impressed
i
have
ever
been
by
sam
adams
just
really
good
stuff
and
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
if
you
like
tripels
wheres
the
10
o
a
nice
brew
pretty
good
for
the
style
might
be
a
tinge
to
extreme
on
the
pineapple
notes
and
carbonation
but
overall
it
was
a
good
drinking
brew
with
nice
flavor
notes
and
character
cloudy
yellow
with
a
big
head
rich
with
carbonation
big
fruity
hop
character
that
blends
well
with
a
big
amount
of
bubble
gum
yeast
aroma
flavor
is
crisp
with
a

tingle
upfront
medium

but
rich
with
bready

sweetness
and
bittersour
apple
bubblegum
and
tropical
fruits
light
refreshing
finish
with
a
lot
of
the
fruity
hops
and
subtle
notes
of
yeast
lingering
i
would
gladly
drink
this
often
if
it
was
cheaper
o
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
cheers
o
this
is
a
good
tripel
maybe
not
as
good
as
a
traditional
trappist
but
its
definitely
a
good
beer
worth
it
to
pick
up
750ml

some

with

ending
overall
a
very
good
complex
and
flavorful
brew
very
nicely
done
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
interesting
beer
o
this
has
good
drinkability
the
flavor
is
really
nice
and
i
have
no
problem
having
glass
after
glass
i
think
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
a
really
nice
beer
overall
the
abv
is
hidden
really
well
i
never
would
have
guessed
it
was
10
i
recommend
trying
this
one
i
enjoyed
it
i
havent
had
too
many
tripels
so
maybe
my
ratings
are
a
little
high
but
i
think
this
is
a
high
quality
brew
this
is
a
really
nice
tripel
i
am
surprised
it
might
be
a
tad
too
sweet
and
the
carbonation
is
very
strong
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
made
american
made
tripels
i
had
to
try
this
beer
being
a
huge
fan
of
tripels
the
look
of
this
beer
is
right
when
the
head
is
dissipates
a
bit
it
turns
to
a
meringue
like
foam
with
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
big
pepper
perhaps
too
much
for
my
tastes
but
the
taste
is
more
complex
sweet
honey
husk
a
bitter
alcohol
taste
and
yes
some
pepper
overall
a
good
show
for
a
beer
that
is
rarely
reproduced
correctly
outside
of
belgium
a
must
try
for
tripel
fans
at
the
price
i
paid
10
though
there
are
better
originals
and
i
am
unsure
why
a
brewery
like
sam
adams
cannot
undercut
an
import
because
i
would
probably
drink
more
of
this
beer
i
grabbed
2
of
these
along
with
2
13th
hour
bottles
without
knowing
anything
about
this
release
or
the
barrel
room
collection
nice
looking
bottles
i
had
the
first
with
a
bunch
of
friends
the
other
day
and
am
currently
working
on
the
2nd
bottle
today
pours
that
nice
straw
color
and
puts
up
a
nice
pillowy
head
that
muffintopped
my
glass
aroma
of
spice
and
belgian
yeasts
bananas
and
alcohol
taste
matches
the
nose
with
the
yeast
up
front
followed
by
the
tropical
fruits
and
zesty
citrus
with
some
light
breadey
notes
in
the
finish
and
some
heat
from
the
abv
mouthfeell
is
a
little
zesty
and
prickly
and
sticky
yet
clean
and
what
a
nice
buzz
this
ones

o
a
very
likable
beer

excellent
brew
drinkabilityoverallsam
nailed
this
one
im
excited
to
see
more
american
brewers
nail
my
overall
favorite
style
and
bring
new
twists
to
this
delicious
classic
although
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sam
adams
in
general
this
beer
is
definitely
a
winner
tropical
fruit
and
typical
belgian
style
flavors
are
all
present
plus
theres
a
big
richness
that
puts
this
one
just
beyond
average
a
very
encouraging
beer
overall
o
it
was
a
good
beer
i
would
get
get
again
poured
into
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
with
a
ton
of
foam
from
the
corked
bottle
cloudy
hazy
pale
yellowgold
color
the
head
settles
into
a
thick
white
foamy
and
frothy
two
inches
aromas
are
lemon
citrus
and
light
spicings
of
coriander
and
nutmeg
with
a
toasty
character
also
pineapple
and
mango
aromas
release
as
the
beer
warms
flavors
are
light
and
mild
with
a
blended
fruit
background
and
very
light
toasting
and
nutmeg
spicing
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
with
a
spiced
crispness
on
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
very
mild
with
pineapple
and
peach
balancing
a
peppery
bite
much
milder
than
i
was
expecting
overall
i
have
to
give
it
to
sa
its
not
a
bad
beerin
fact
quite
palatable
and
deep
o
a
solid
example
of
a
tripel
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
right
out
of
the
bottle
my
only
complaint
being
that
there
is
a
vague
bubblegum
sweetness
to
the
malts
i
suspect
however
that
a
good
six
to
twelvemonth
aging
would
remove
this
sweetness
and
make
the
brew
far
more
complex
and
satisfying
overall
not
too
bad
it
no
longer
is
my
favorite
tripel
ever
it
has
some
glaringly
unusual
characteristics
and
it
probably
isnt
going
to
hold
up
to
much
more
aging
mo
very
crisp
and
bright
carbonation
that
livens
up
the
flavor
really
hits
the
mark
with
the
style
while
imparting
some
nice
fruity
tones
into
a
very
enjoyable
beer
really
liked
this
one
more
so
than
a
lot
of
the
reviews
i
read
led
me
to
believe
i
would
some
strong
tastes
but
they
worked
well
together
very
unique
for
sa
i
poured
this
beer
into
s
snifter
glass
it
has
a
nice
golden
straw
color
body
with
a
little
white
fizzy
head
that
disappears
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
spice
and
a
little
banana
comes
threw
the
taste
starts
off
sweetalmost
bubble
gum
then
it
gets
a
spicyclove
and
white
pepper
the
mouth
feel
is
good
overall
i
think
this
a
beer
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
soapy
head
which
gives
way
to
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
bananas
and
green
fruits
along
with
some
yeastiness
and
a
little
clove
the
taste
has
a
little
bready
companent
as
the
backbone
with
a
nice
sweet
flavor
over
it
bananas
and
green
fruits
play
along
with
a
slight
candy
taste
little
to
no
presence
of
booze
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
the
overall
beer
is
solid
nice
sweet
taste
and
smell
not
as
big
as
others
in
the
class
but
a
nice
everyman
beer
proof
that
sams
can
make
a
really
good
beer
of
any
style
if
they
want
bought
this
as
part
of
the
set
when
i
went
to
the
brewery
last
year
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
had
a
pretty
good
retention
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
basically
like
any
other
tripel
out
there
but
not
quite
as
strong
smelling
there
is
some
spices
the
come
through
and
there
are
also
some
fruity
scents
too
the
funk
level
on
the
nose
isnt
very
high
the
taste
doesnt
give
off
much
funk
either
from
the
wild
yeast
the
fruity
flavors
taste
decent
for
a
tripel
and
the
spices
do
the
same
was
well
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
and
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
glad
i
got
to
try
it
definitely
worth
a
try
o
like
many
of
sam
adams
brews
this
tripel
is
delicious
and
approachable
without
being
truly
memorable
delicious
though
and
worth
the
investment
in
the
three
pack
of
barrel
room
collection
beers
while
it
isnt
my
typical
type
of
beer
i
liked
it
and
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
on
occasion
when
it
comes
into
the
market
the
sa
rep
told
us
that
they
would
be
bringing
it
in
due
to
the
success
of
boulevards
kc
local
smoke
stack
series
picked
this
one
up
not
too
long
ago
the
fancy
bottle
had
me
excited
much
as
a
great
book
cover
would
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
aromas
of
oak
vanilla
belgian
yeast
and
white
pepper
on
the
palate
this
one
was
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
oak
yeast
vanilla
and
candi
sugar
a
promising
avenue
to
be
explored
by
samuel
adams
poured
a
4
head
which
took
a
long
time
to
dissipate
and
subsequent
pours
were
equally
huge
rich
hazy
yelloworange
color
smell
is
caramel
and
malt
and
a
little
citrus
taste
is
more
of
the
same
and
has
some
tropical
fruit
hints
as
well
flavor
boosts
as
it
warms
quite
a
strong
beer
10
salty
with
a
long
slightly
burning
finish
i
definitely
see
both
the
belgian
tripel
influence
and
the
american
big
and
bold
influence
thank
you
to
the
friend
who
gifted
it
to
me
pretty
darn
good
overall
much
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
first
off
i
must
say
that
this
doesnt
taste
at
all
like
a
samuel
adams
brew
i
am
glad
that
the
boston
beer
company
tried
something
new
with
the
barrel
room
collection
its
interesting
when
consumed
fresh
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
beer
i
think
it
would
improve
with
some
cellaring
sam
adams
new
world
tripel
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
an
nice
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
pale
malt
and
dry
spicy
yeast
the
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
but
dries
out
quickly
with
fruity
esters
tropical
fruit
is
there
as
advertised
there
is
a
bit
of
oak
flavor
but
it
fits
in
really
well
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
noticed
if
it
wasnt
mentioned
on
the
label
the
beer
finishes
dry
with
a
mild
alcohol
burn
but
not
bad
for
its
strength
solid
tripel
not
worth
the
price
tag
wheres
the
barrel
aged
oakiness
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
would
certainly
have
another
seems
like
it
will
pair
well
with
the
sausage
cacciatore
i
have
brewing
in
the
slow
cooker
750ml
bottle
purchased
at
mckinnons
in
salem
bottle
number
1180
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangeyellow
with
a
good
inch
or
so
of
persistent
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
very
decent
lacing
wood
ripe
banana
date
nut
and
spice
all
play
parts
in
the
aroma
ripe
banana
apple
pear
jump
right
out
with
notes
of
nut
spice
and
malt
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
to
make
this
much
more
drinkable
than
expected
complex
delicious
and
drinkable
wow
im
impressed
d
overall
a
very
nice
american
tripel
d
a
solid
tripel
welldone
the
barrel
aging
helped
accent
it
with
some
drier
wood
characters
that
i
appreciated
a
welcomed
surprise
from
sam
adams
d
even
given
the
10
apv
this
beer
stays
extremely
drinkable
and
feels
fairly
refreshing
even
with
the
flavors
the
lemon
sweetness
helps
a
lot
cool
bottle
and
interesting
to
search
for
hints
of
oak
which
i
searched
for
but
did
not
find
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
brew
that
im
all
about
right
now
belgian
tripel
and
farmhouse
ales
are
in
for
me
big
time
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
a
wonderous
brew
a
much
better
offering
than
the
american
kriek
only
have
the
stony
brook
red
left
to
go
from
the
bottle
no
1180
sampled
on
october
7
2010
the
pour
is
a
highly
carbonated
pale
yellow
with
about
two
inches
of
fluffy
bubbly
head
that
slowly
diminishes
it
is
not
as
murky
as
you
might
think
the
aroma
on
this
one
is
more
wheatlike
yeasty
and
lightly
hopped
along
with
the
remnants
of
the
oak
barrel
the
hard
liquor
scent
is
not
all
that
evident
the
taste
also
hughlights
the
wheat
and
yeast
with
more
of
a
hard
liquor
feel
on
the
tongue
than
on
the
nose
overall
it
has
some
good
qualities
and
of
the
three
barrel
room
collection
beers
seems
to
be
the
milder
despite
its
10
abv
tasty
enough
but
a
bit
odd
for
a
triple
the
oak
would
be
nice
without
the
char
character
and
the
spicyness
adds
a
strange
twist
which
really
isnt
needed
in
a
great
triple
lacking
the
classic
softness
found
in
the
great
triples
as
well
perhaps
some
softening
of
the
water
would
help
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
do
more
than
just
one
or
two
d
great
representation
of
the
style
goes
down
very
easily
nice
job
sam
adams
d
liked
it
not
the
best
tripel
but
a
solid
take
on
the
style
missing
some
of
the
barrel
aging
packs
quite
a
punch
glad
this
is
being
shared
i
like
this
beer
i
went
to
the
sam
adams
brewery
in
boston
and
im
glad
i
picked
this
up

a
thick
white
three
fingered

drinkability
fairly
easy
drinkability
well
crafted
brew
very
well
representative
of
the
style
the
beer
has

belgian
style
tripple
taste
hopefully
sam
adams
keepscontinues
this
series
as
it
is
a
exciting
continuation
of
thier
beers
overalli
am
sad
after
drinking
this
soley
because
i
know
it
will
not
be
available
for
purchase
again
it
was
a
very
tasty
brew
with
many
flavors
that
complimented
each
other
very
nicely
taste
is
in
line
with
the
aroma
spicey
notes
from
the
yeast
coupled
with
banana
pear
apple
and
a
big
alcohol
presence
both
in
flavor
and
warmth
medium
to
light
feel
with
a
moderately
high
level
of
carbonation
the
finish
of
this
brew
is
a
bit
dry
with
some
oakiness
noted
in
the
aftertaste
as
it
warms
some
minor
notes
of
clove
come
out
in
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
lingering
yeast
character
is
left
residing
in
the
mouth
along
with
a
taste
of
banana
clove
and
pear
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
the
oak
and
dryness
is
exaggerated
along
with
some
spiciness
that
is
not
directly
identifiable
but
all
together
is
enjoyable
bought
this
during
a
vacation
on
cape
cod
i
liked
the
beer
but
i
was
not
overly
impressed
my
expectations
were
very
high
from
a
brand
name
like
sam
adams
but
when
i
drank
it
i
felt
that
it
was
a
little
better
than
the
average
belgian
triple
taste
was
not
as
spicy
as
i
had
hoped
and
the
fruit
notes
in
the
beginning
were
not
very
strong
it
finishes
clean
but
that
is
the
problem
i
feel
that
there
needs
to
be
a
better
lingering
taste
than
what
it
had
i
will
take
into
consideration
that
sam
adams
recommends
bottle
conditioning
this
beverage
after
the
purchase
i
believe
that
this
could
make
the
flavors
more
pronounced
part
ii
of
my
barrel
room
collection
odyssey
get
some
it
pours
an
eversoslightly
hazy
amber
straw
topped
by
a
seemingly
perpetual
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
plenty
o
clove
banana
nutmeg
black
pepper
watermelon
wheat
wet
hay
a
tiny
bit
o
horse
blanket
and
some
cantaloupe
the
taste
follows
with
the
banana
cantaloupe
and
clove
taking
preeminence
a
touch
of
oak
is
in
the
background
bringing
with
it
a
very
light
ray
of
vanilla
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
carbonation
very
light
for
the
style
and
a
very
smooth
feel
not
a
bad
tripel
overall
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
i
dont
think
the
barrel
aging
did
all
that
much
for
it
good
beer
glad
that
i
stopped
at
kappys
because
i
havent
found
this
in
maine
yet
4
5
d
this
is
easily
my
favorite
sa
brew
until
now
just
about
everything
has
left
me
unimpressed
everytime
i
find
my
self
pulling
a
cork
from
a
bottle
of
beer
i
wonder
if
the
beer
inside
is
worthy
of
such
a
fancy
presentation
this
one
is
decent
beer
from
sam
mediumbodied
and
fairly
dry
but
still
sweet
with
a
good
carbonation
level
decent
overall
but
not
too
impressive
for
a
barrelaged
tripel
taste
begins
with
a
peek
of
tart
then
pale
sweetness
dry
in
the
middle
with
a
lightly
alcoholic
close
tannins
seems
to
come
of
the
forefront
after
the
swallow
mouthfeel
is
smooth
to
start
with
a
bit
of
a
rough
close
with
drinkability
alright
some
good
components
here
but
it
just
doesnt
all
come
together
for
me
poured
a
cloudy
deep
goldenalmost
amber
with
a
nicely
formed
white
head
strings
of
lace
decorate
the
glass
a
nice
tropical
fruitbiscuit
and
yeast
aroma
leads
to
an
assertive
blast
of
oak
touch
of
vanilla
as
well
very
interesting
i
think
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
an
oak
aged
tripel
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
as
far
as
a
tripel
goes
but
the
oak
is
a
bit
much
and
off
sets
the
subtleties
citrus
mango
and
pineapple
with
a
touch
of
muscat
grapes
nearly
champagnelike
in
terms
of
texture
but
more
body
of
course
id
try
this
again
if
given
the
chance
f
some
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
spices
galore
more
warming
tingly
booze
quite
boozy
actually
belgian
sweet
malts
and
fruit
linger
more
apple
tropical
fruit
flavors
and
a
little
yeasty
drinkability
is
pretty
good
especially
considering
according
to
the
bottle
this
is
10
the
better
of
the
three
barrel
collections
in
my
opinion
and
probably
the
only
one
i
would
buy
again
ill
stick
to
la
fin
du
monde
and
chimay
cinq
cents
for
my
favorite
tripels
looks
nice
a
half
inch
of
foam
settled
to
a
thin
cap
of
fine
white
bubbles
and
a
more
substantial
collar
good
head
retention
semisticky
lace
the
beer
was
clear
and
deep
gold
with
a
bit
of
an
amber
hue
fruity
aroma
grainy
malt
spicy
clove
and
pepper
alcohol
bready
bit
of
oak
peppery
throughout
but
mostly
up
front
and
in
the
finish
sugary
sweetness
mild
bitterness
honey
with
some
fruit
character
but
not
as
much
as
in
the
aroma
slight
astringency
and
woody
flavour
finishes
with
some
alcohol
and
warmth
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
was
restrained
decent
texture
not
bad
at
all
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
the
flavour
based
on
the
aroma
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
some
age
might
dry
this
out
a

i
like
it
but
if
belgian
monastic
ales
are
all
about
the
magic
and
complexity
of
various
yeast
strains
this
just
doesnt
measure
up
pours
a
golden
yellow
body
chock
full
of
yeasty
flakes
aromas
of
pear
orange
peel
banana
clove
and
coriander
flavors
mimic
the
aromas
a
burst
of
fruity
esters
and
spicy
yeast
some
latent
bitterness
in
the
belgian
yeast
sort
of
way
spicy
dry
finish
creamy
rich
mouthfeel
its
no
masterpiece
but
new
world
tripel
is
one
of
the
better
domestic
tripels
i
have
tried
overall
its
a
very
light
fruity
flavorful
beer
with
a
nice
complexity
to
it
enjoy
brought
it
back
from
the
boston
after
a
tour
of
the
brewery
enjoying
it
right
now
in
los
angeles
and
am
14
through
very
smooth
for
the
style
and
very
drinkable
for
the
percentage
9
not
overly
malty
in
its
class
it
does
not
stand
out
though
since
i
paid
10
for
the
bottle
3x
variety
pack
for
30
i
dont
feel
like
it
is
entirely
worth
the
money
for
the
beer
alone
still
enjoying
the
experience
and
remembering
the
tour
d
disguised
abv
fairly
well
full
and
fruity
a
nice
grey
wet
wintry
day
easy
sipper
that
warms
but
would
be
a
bit
tacky
on
a
warmer
day
the
pour
is
a
hazy
orange
brown
but
not
too
heavy
looking
leading
to
a
thin
soontodissipate
white
head
and
a
wee
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
full
of
fruity
spice
and
candy
and
the
taste
lives
up
to
this
with
cloves
banana
a
bit
of
citrus
hop
funky
yeast
and
sad
to
say
a
hit
of
orange
ssips
drink
a
bit
sweet
but
as
a
sipper
nice
although
it
could
be
easy
to
drink
more
quickly
withs
its
clean
body
and
bubbly
carbonation
it
is
restrained
by
a
nice
creamy
quality
however
i
look
forward
to
the
next
hopefully
a
bit
less
sweet
batch
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
creamy
a
little
too
carbonated
the
alchohol
is
very
well
hidden
so
watch
out
as
this
one
could
creep
up
on
you
as
its
a
very
easy
drinker
this
is
quite
good
and
very
drinkable
for
a
barrel
aged
tripel
its
not
the
most
complex
tripel
out
there
and
the
oak
is
very
subtle
but
they
did
a
really
nice
job
making
this
a
very
drinkable
flavorful
beer
nice
job
bbc
i
would
def
have
this
one
again
great
color
body
pour
and
taste
you
want
from
a
beer
in
this
price
range
i
just
need
them
to
make
a
nice
dark
brown
ale
and
id
be
rating
this
higher
ok
samuel
adams
ive
tried
all
three
of
youre
barrel
room
beers
36
later
and
this
is
hands
down
the
best
of
the
three
not
completely
a
true
triple
but
pretty
damn
close
im
sorry
i
bad
mouthed
the
kriek
and
only
okd
the
red
this
is
excellent
this
could
be
describe
as
an
extreme
wit
it
does
not
remind
me
of
a
tripel
which
is
far
more
malty
and
sweet
drinkability
had
no
signs
of
abv
good
drinkability
and
fully
of
fruity
pleasant
flavors
the
taste
is
very
nice
there
is
a
clean
feel
to
the
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
prickly
mouthfeel
or
the
syrupy
heaviness
and
full
bodiedness
of
a
more
typical
belgian
it
is
decidedly
lighter
there
is
plenty
of
sweet
malts
candied
sugars
clove
and
florals
in
the
beer
there
isnt
much
in
the
way
of
spices
or
a
strong
coriander
and
star
anise
flavor
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
the
aftertaste
is
very
smooth
and
light
the
10
abv
is
extremely
deceiving
although
some
warming
booziness
does
emerge
as
things
settle
this
is
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
d
not
bad
sam
not
bad
dnot
a
bad
beer
not
a
bad
amount
of
complexity
well
crafted
and
good
representation
of
the
style
i
would
drink
this
again
d
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
bottle
was
gone
before
i
finished
this
review
pours
a
pleasant
semicloudy
honey
color
with
a
thin
lacing
lightly
carbonated
it
maintains
an
island
of
foam
in
the
middle
as
many
tripels
do
nose
is
rather
light
a
bit
astringency
feeds
in
but
not
much
else
taste
is
light
but
good
light
malty
sweets
with
a
backdrop
of
alcohols
that
isnt
too
prevalent
but
enough
to
know
youre
drinking
a
rather
high
octane
beer
goes
down
easy
not
much
lingering
except
for
a
little
bit
of
yeastiness
overall
a
good
tripel
option
if
youre
going
for
tripel
but
dont
want
it
to
be
as
heavy
this
tastes
a
heck
of
a
lot
like
la
fin
du
monde
its
got
that
belgian
yeastiness
that
unibroue
has
in
their
beers
with
a
bit
of
an
alcoholic
burn
mouthfeel
is
big
and
full
due
to
high
carbonation
reminiscent
of
westmalle
tripel
its
a
decent
beer
so
far
i
like
the
stoney
brook
red
more
i
would
give
it
a
b
overall
this
is
a
solid
effort
in
the
first
of
a
real
limited
edition
series
for
sam
adams
it
is
clearly
a
conservative
offering
aiming
to
appeal
to
more
wide
audiences
while
still
exploring
a
new
territory
although
i
am
not
a
giant
fan
of
this
style
i
still
find
this
brew
to
be
lacking
an
assertiveness
that
would
incite
me
to
purchase
it
again
still
i
am
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
its
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
unless
it
was
to
someone
like
me
who
is
looking
to
try
all
types
of
different
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
with
a
drying
finish
that
makes
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
the
10
abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
i
am
very
glad
to
have
the
other
sabrc
beers
to
try
because
this
one
was
quite
a
treat
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
for
the
pre
thanksgiving
onslaught
of
drinking
poured
in
to
a
duvel
glass
new
world
tripel
is
a
mildly
hazy
orange
color
with
a
very
large
three
fingers
of
white
heading
head
fades
quickly
enough
from
the
smell
i
detect
some
dry
champagne
qualities
some
hops
a
dusty
cellar
like
presence
and
a
tiny
hint
of
fruit
taste
is
again
dry
with
some
pear
and
apple
skin
in
the
finish
taste
can
be
somewhat
soapy
at
times
but
leaves
a
pretty
tasty
aftertaste
body
is
about
medium
and
right
on
target
for
the
style
as
far
as
carbonation
goes
this
beer
scores
some
extra
points
for
the
way
in
which
the
alcohol
is
hidden
you
really
cannot
taste
that
ten
percent
though
you
can
feel
it
after
a
few
pulls
overall
i
am
a
little
disappointed
considering
this
came
from
their
barrel
room
there
is
nothing
off
putting
about
it
i
just
find
it
a
little
bit
boring
it
is
well
balanced
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
that
would
make
me
buy
it
again
cheers
to
sam
adams
for
this
series
but
i
cannot
give
this
beer
a
recommendation
extremely
drinkable
and
balanced
an
absolute
homerun
from
sa
d
the
lush
mouthfeel
and
crisp
fruit
flavors
produce
a
big
beer
with
good
approachability
i
think
it
will
be
even
better
in
23
years
with
some
age
to
even
out
the
alcoholic
qualities
i
didnt
have
big
expectations
for
this
brew
but
maybe
i
should
have
strongly
very
good
beer
for
great
value
nice
beer
looks
and
smells
terrific
the
alcohol
content
is
not
well
disguised
and
that
its
my
major
gripe
overall
it
was
nice
but
i
will
seek
out
another
belgian
tripel
to
taste
next
super
tasty
beer
one
of
my
favorites
put
on
tap
in
my
home
tap
cask
conditioned
so
nice
and
bubbly
but
has
a
very
creamy
nice
mouthfeel
beautiful
cloudy
tripel
color
initial
smell
is
of
bananas
with
a
little
bit
of
pear
tastes
like
banana
bubble
gum
very
complex
flavor
and
a
nicely
made
beer
flavor
is
clearly
driven
by
the
yeast
which
is
appropriate
for
the
style
booze
is
present
but
not
overpowering
flavor
a
good
domestic
tripel
but
if
banana
is
not
your
preference
for
the
dominant
flavor
in
a
belgian
style
then
pick
a
different
tripel
such
as
fin
du
monde
o
average
triple
worth
getting
if
the
price
is
right
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
think
this
is
a
good
american
take
on
a
tripel
definitely
has
a
nice
peppery
bite
to
the
flavor
along
with
toasted
malts
coriander
allspice
and
an
assertive
bitterness
booze
is
less
noticeable
in
the
taste
this
will
warm
one
up
smooth
at
the
beginning
but
bitter
in
the
end
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
had
just
about
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
no
off
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
well
done
this
beer
has
nice
drinkability
its
fairly
smooth
crisp
a
little
creamy
well
hidden
alcohol
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
does
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
would
be
the
perfect
amount
for
me
it
might
start
to
wear
on
me
a
little
if
i
have
more
than
that
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
and
aroma
they
are
both
good
and
i
think
they
are
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
your
a
fan
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
for
an
american
brewed
tripel
it
was
good
and
it
seemed
to
be
better
than
most
it
isnt
a
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
but
i
do
think
its
one
of
the
better
american
brewed
tripels
that
ive
had
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
nice
tripel
keep
it
up
golden
in
color
smells
like
spice
clove
banana
and
some
bread
taste
is
malt
and
yeast
with
light
sweetness
and
spice
mouthful
is
medium
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
triple
very
refreshing
this
is
a
very
good
belgium
ale
i
will
buy
this
again
ring
ring
ring
bells
ringing
clearly
the
monks
are
happy
tonight
because
they
are
drinking
the
beer
on

this
is
the
cure
for
quasimodo
overall
a
good
representation
for
the
tripel
style
not
overly
sweet

obnoxious

an

well

im
surprised
this
isnt
more
popular
especially
for
its
low
price
point
great
tasting
brew
very
happy
i
gave
this
a
try
overall
a
nice
year
round
tripel
anytime
i
see
this
in
a
create
your
own
six
pack
area
i
will
pick
it
up
overall
a
solid
triple
i
wish
that
the
clove
was
a
little
more
balanced
with
the
other
spice
flavors
but
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
i
just
dont
like
belgians
but
regardless
i
think
the
quality
is
good
amazing

seems
to
linger
in
your
mouth
while
you
are
waiting
for
your
next
drink
mouth
is
slightly
watery
but
solid
for
a
triple
weyerbacher
doesnt
get
enough
credit
for
its
lineup
this
is
a
stellar
beer
too
strong
for
me
mildly
sweet
taste
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
fruitiness
was
unexpected
ive
never
had
a
tripel
but
fun
for
a
change
sweet
with
a
slight
hop
finish
dry
nice
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
good
tripel
but
not
outstanding
nice
smooth
tripel
less
of
an
alcohol
taste
than
i
expected
with
a
sweet
dry
finish
quite
tatsty
this
beer
is
quite
good
i
have
had
the
luxury
of
tasting
this
exquisite
beer
although
i
paid
16
for
a
sixer
at
a
local
distributor
it
was
a
little
over
priced
none
the
less
it
is
one
of
the
finer
beers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
the
date
on
my
bottles
was
oct
15th
2014
i
drank
mine
on
the
4th
of
dec
2014
considering
this
beers
taste
may
change
over
time
as
the
review
states
i
feel
it
would
only
get
better
with
age
i
highly
recommend
buying
this
beer
unless
you
are
a
complete
cheap
ocharlie
buy
which
you
wouldnt
have
this
app
to
begin
with
lol
you
will
be
satisfied
slainté
i
mostly
liked
it
but
found
it
a
bit
strong
the
bitter
was
a
bit
much
in
the
beginning
but
it
grew
on
me
pours
a
pleasant
golden
copper
color
not
overly
carbonated
leaves
a
soapy
head
that
rapidly
dissipates
taste
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
plenty
of
coriander
orange
peel
cardamom
and
sweet
belgian
candy
an
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
splash
of
hops
but
not
overwhelming
and
the
bitterness
rounds
out
the
sweetness
another
mark
for
weyerbacher
a
great
brewing
company
ehh
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
with
hints
of
banana
and
spices
like
clove
shine
through
the
taste
was
really
refreshing
with
a
smooth
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
making
for
a
tasty
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
and
will
sneak
up
on
you
though
so
be
careful
great
taste
easy
drinking
in
the
winter
really
good
unique
sneaky
strong
o
a
solid
triple
best
yet
its
available
locally
all
year
around
and
its
priced
right
delicious
tasty
and
deep
merry
monks
has
good
mouthfeel
and
interesting
complexities
but
overall
lacks
the
fullflavor
i
really
want
from
a
tripel
its
a
very
fun
beer
light
and
refreshing
but
i
generally
prefer
more
punch
being
packed
ill
definitely
be
looking
to
try
other
weyerbacher
beers
however
as
this
was
definitely
a
creative
brew
hitting
the
fruit
and
cereal
notes
i
expect
from
any
abbey
style
ale
but
in
a
fairly
unique
way
this
was
good
but
nothing
amazing
id
prefer
golden
monkey
for
ease
of
access
cost
and
taste
low
bitterness
belgian
yeast
fruit
and
smooth
the
sweet
comes
goes
even
in
the
same
sip
like
a
lava
lamp
on
the
tongue
first
this
way
then
that
but
ever
so
fluid
charming
powerful
as
all
get
out
at
9
3
no
wonder
them
monks
be
merry
dark
yellow
with
a
rich
head
that
lasts
throughout
the
drinking
process
very
crisp
and
fresh
no
single
flavor
stands
out
or
so
i
felt
but
by
and
large
it
tasted
really
good
by
far
the
beers
best
attribute
is
its
feeling
in
ones
mouth
it
feels
very
creamy
but
not
too
creamy
not
too
much
like
cough
syrup
or
something
it
drives
that
fine
line
between
too
heavy
and
too
smooth
perfectly
the
taste
is
consistently
good
with
a
mellow
spiciness
a
lot
of
sweetness
heartily
enjoyed
overall
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
seems
to
be
well
made
o
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
belgian
bier
lovers
since
it
is
almost
like
weyerbacher
played
it
safe
and
just
tried
to
emulate
what
all
good
belgians
taste
like
while
they
do
not
do
anything
to
try
and
alter
the
perspective
of
a
belgian
tripel
they
do
a
great
job
of
resembling
the
flavors
of
some
of
the
best
tripels
in
the
world
o
really
taste
belgian
here
great
aroma
sweet
and
carbonated
taste
this
is
very
drinkable
and
delicious
the
tastesmell
of
bananas
and
plums
is
both
unique
and
appealing
one
of
the
better
belgian
ales
i
have
had
i
think
merry
monks
is
head
and
shoulders
above
victory
golden
monkey
in
general
a
better
flavored
brew
it
is
certainly
very
drinkable
with
the
9
3
abv
well
hidden
so
that
after
quaffing
a
few
you
wont
even
notice
when
youre
dragged
to
your
cell
although
the
appearance
isnt
great
fizzy
disappearing
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
flavor
and
palate
more
than
make
up
i
also
like
the
appearance
of
both
the
bottled
and
best
by
dates
they
are
blue
against
the
brown
bottle
and
extremely
legible
even
with
a
sweating
bottle
just
about
everything
youd
expect
from
a
well
made
belgianstyle
tripel
it
pours
smooth
with
a
thick
white
foamy
head
and
a
golden
body
has
a
great
smell
with
hints
of
vanilla
spice
and
orange
peel
i
love
how
straight
forward
and
well
rounded
this
beer
is
its
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
slight
tangy
finish
all
around
its
wonderfully
balanced
excellent
trippel
sweet
with
a
respectable
alcohol
taste
a
beer
that
can
make
an
impact
without
an
aggressive
hop
flavor
is
doing
well
by
me
i
do
love
hops
too
no
fancy
beer
jargon
that
i
can
offer
though
my
top
choice
over
la
fin
du
monde
and
chimay
trippel
any
day
o
solid
overall
pure
flavors
and
fits
the
style
it
would
be
better
if
its
were
a
bit
driert
o
for
me
i
think
merry
monks
is
at
its
peak
right
now
6
months
after
bottling
and
best
enjoyed
on
the
warmer
side
i
am
a
fan
of
weyerbacher
and
think
merry
monks
is
the
best
of
their
yearround
offerings
for
the
price
11
99
6pack
8
99
750ml
bottle
the
quality
and
attention
to
style
this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
craft
brewed
belgian
triples
in
america
although
i
prefer
the
mouthfeel
of
merry
monks
from
a
750ml
corked
caged
bottle
the
12oz
format
is
just
as
good
and
a
better
value
being
that
the
brewery
boasts
an
active
barrel
aging
program
blasphemy
insanity
heresy
and
now
rhumpshaka
i
would
absolutely
love
for
them
to
experiment
with
a
merry
monks
aged
in
whiskey
barrels
4
75
o
if
this
beer
had
more
carbonation
it
would
be
even
better
but
as
it
stands
its
just
a
solid
tripel
with
a
nice
intensity
of
flavor
overall
really
enjoyable
beer
totally
masks
its
abv
a
little
too
fruity
for
me
but
very
enjoyable
great
beer
from
weyerbacher
not
a
goto
brew
but
if
i
see
it
and
want
a
good
interesting
beer
this
is
the
one
as
i
let
it
warm
just
a
bit
the
banana
really
came
through
too
strong
for
me
not
changing
the
rating
but
still
worth
noting
it
really
uses
the
fruity
flavor
to
mask
the
abv
it
really
is
complex
if
youre
on
the
fence
after
seeing
reviews
i
say
go
for
it
you
wont
regret
it
even
if
you
dont
love
it
its
light
amber
color
and
lack
of
head
or
aroma
did
not
detract
from
a
robust
belgian
taste
no
hops
refreshing
for
an
american
beer
slightly
sweet
balanced
and
with
the
full
complex
taste
of
a
true
belgian
overall
one
of
the
few
belgian
style
tripels
ive
had
and
i
was
fairly
impressed
im
on
board
with
this
more
so
than
a
witbier
some
similar
characteristics
but
bolder
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
still
not
quite
my
style
but
ill
consider
grabbing
this
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
belgian
style
beer
a
random
selection
from
the
store
this
evening
and
i
was
greatly
surprised
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
the
fragrance
was
amazing
very
fruity
not
perfume
like
as
someone
else
reviewed
great
blond
color
and
nice
lacing
from
the
head
and
deeeelicious
with
the
first
mouthful
refreshing
full
of
flavor
a
very
well
crafted
beer
well
done
weyerbacker
this
is
a
beer
that
could
get
you
into
some
trouble
on
a
lazy
summer
day
one
moment
you
feel
great
3
beers
later
youre
in
the
neighbors
backyard
getting
tasered
overall
im
shit
in
the
wind
buy
it
love
it
its
wonderful
i
love
it
its
dark
and
has
a
head
of
an
inch
or
less
i
dont
much
care
for
this
one
o
a
solid
tripel
been
drinking
a
large
amount
ipas
lately
including
my
first
ht
on
a
trip
to
northeast
so
this
was
good
balance
to
that
recommended
overall
a
remake
please
its
over
the
map
aggressive
boozy
character
way
too
much
sweetness
and
zero
yeasty
complexity
or
mystery
unsubtle
one
complaint
would
be
this
particular
glass
did
not
have
very
good
head
retention
in
the
future
i
will
be
more
verbose
o
merry
monks
ale
is
definitely
a
very
solid
offering
from
weyerbacher
theres
a
few
elements
that
count
definitely
be
improved
upon
namely
the
slightly
imbalanced
sweetness
in
the
flavor
i
would
have
liked
to
see
more
earthiness
shine
through
to
kind
of
cut
down
the
fruitiness
the
coriander
and
clove
spice
just
didnt
do
the
job
fully
other
than
that
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
that
is
great
for
late
night
slowsipping
could
do
with
some
improvement
but
still
worth
the
try
if
its
readily
available
odi
liked
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
a
great
intro
into
the
style
and
i
prefer
this
more
than
many
pours
a
clean
amber
with
a
2
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
with
very
light
lacing
smell
is
malt
and
lemon
forward
with
many
spice
notes
hidden
tastes
of
cereal
and
malt
with
a
long
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
medium
body
with
a
lingering
finish
on
the
palate
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
great
great
cantmiss
beer
o
surprised
how
much
i
like
this
i
thought
it
would
be
overly
spiced
judging
by
the
aroma
but
thats
not
the
case
this
is
fruity
and
yeasty
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
two
o
really
good
representation
of
the
style
i
would
concider
this
among
the
bett
of
the
belgian
style
american
ales
today
better
than
anything
other
american
beligan
syle
brewerys
are
producing
currently
great
triple
overall
this
is
a
delicious
tripel
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
has
nice
complexity
definitely
would
drink
this
one
again
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
pours
a
slightly
amber
gold
with
a
nice
head
and
lacing
which
diminishes
in
a
few
minutes
nose
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
yeast
spice
and
pear
fruit
medium
body
approaching
full
with
a
nice
slick
texture
very
well
carbonated
from
bottle
conditioning
more
flavorful
than
most
belgian
tripels
although
this
one
is
us
made
with
a
nice
tartness
against
a
typical
belgian
flavor
profile
with
a
touch
of
spice
finishes
nicely
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
at
the
back
top
of
the
throat
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
o
like
i
said
this
beer
is
a
treat
and
a
real
surprise
for
me
i
expected
this
to
fall
somewhere
in
the
range
of
a
golden
monkey
or
the
like
but
this
is
a
legitimately
good
tripel
weyerbacher
has
a
great
tripel
in
merry
monks
much
better
than
their
quad
very
much
worth
a
try
i
enjoyed
weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
so
i
thought
i
would
give
this
one
a
shot
at
9
3
abv
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
a
strong
beer
as
tripels
are
and
so
i
was
ok
with
paying
11
99
for
a
6
pack
as
a
result
however
i
found
the
alcohol
flavor
and
dryness
of
this
beer
to
be
overwhelming
i
did
not
get
the
sweet
finish
and
instead
found
the
alcohol
really
coming
through
with
every
sip
the
faint
fruit
and
spice
flavors
did
little
to
mask
it
was
really
hoping
for
a
better
experience
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
tasted
smelled
a
lot
like
rotten
fruit
alcohol
now
i
dont
usually
drink
tripels
which
is
why
i
didnt
score
it
lower
but
if
they
all
taste
like
this
ill
never
drink
another
one
it
was
that
bad
i
found
myself
forcing
it
down
quicker
because
it
definitely
started
to
develop
a
stronger
rotten
taste
as
the
beers
temperature
rose
higher
not
a
beer
i
would
reccommend
i
have
had
the
monks
many
times
but
wanted
to
do
a
full
review
to
see
when
it
would
fall
good
looking
beer
that
has
a
nice
belgian
nose
but
you
do
notice
the
alcohol
in
the
smell
love
the
taste
something
about
this
beer
really
hits
me
right
and
with
the
abv
you
have
to
give
it
some
bonus
points
although
you
do
notice
the
alcohol
my
biggest
observation
is
the
guy
on
the
label
he
really
looks
like
a
child
offender
excellent
beer
that
i
will
have
often
overall
3
75
i
have
to
state
that
my
initial
reservations
about
this
brew
based
on
the
creepy
label
art
were
unfounded
very
good
tripel
and
very
refreshing
take
on
a
standard
and
popular
style
very
good
beer
and
a
dangerous
one
why
because
this
is
a
dry
refreshing
and
light
on
the
palate
tripel
that
is
nine
point
three
percent
abv
thats
why
i
typed
it
in
all
caps
folks
be
very
careful
with
this
bad
boy
because
it
can
creep
up
on
you
the
flavors
are
quite
good
and
there
arent
really
off
flavors
however
the
booze
is
just
too
huge
in
this
beer
o
definitely
a
return
beer
im
drinking
it
now
i
drank
it
3
days
ago
on
a
saliboat
id
highly
recommend
it
just
dont
let
it
get
to
close
to
lukewarm
unless
youre
a
big
fan
of
belgian
tripels
otherwise
it
might
compromise
the
taste
o
overall
this
was
a
very
mellow
full
bodied
interpretation
laid
back
lazy
co2
and
boozy
like
that
uncle
everyone
has
had
this
one
years
ago
dont
know
how
it
evaded
my
review
list
or
what
my
initial
impression
was
to
compare
to
the
flavor
wasnt
bad
just
when
i
think
tripel
i
think
lighter
golden
body
snappy
carbonation
more
spiciness
head
formation
and
sharp
drinking
experience
as
well
a
little
unfiltered
floaties
are
also
a
welcome
gesture
to
give
you
an
idea
of
my
preference
st
bernardus
watou
and
unibroues
la
fin
du
monde
all
make
for
fantastic
examples
again
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
off
base
per
style
to
my
liking
and
a
bit
heavy
handed
in
the
maltbody
department
overall
a
complex
unique
and
altogether
delicious
beer
that
stays
true
to
style
in
some
ways
but
falls
short
in
its
lack
of
hop
aroma
and
bitterness
also
a
bit
light
and
sweet
for
the
style
still
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
overall
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
you
should
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
2
bombers
of
it
one
to
drink
right
away
and
get
a
solid
buzz
on
and
one
to
cellar
for
up
to
6
months
the
comparison
is
indescribable
overall
a
very
good
american
take
on
a
belgian
tripel
good
mix
of
yeast
spices
and
dried
fruit
notes
nice
and
dry
but
somewhat
one
note
this
is
pretty
crass
and
rough
around
the
edges
it
lacks
the
smoothness
and
balance
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
style
not
horrid
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
expected
a
lot
from
this
being
a
similar
style
to
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
la
fin
du
monde
tripel
this
one
is
relative
it
calories
at
around
270280
and
abv
9
0
but
far
off
in
the
taste
i
would
compare
this
to
the
taste
of
a
ground
up
christmas
wreath
the
aftertaste
is
very
strong
and
unsettling
at
first
but
eventually
tones
down
a
bit
to
that
of
cut
grass
i
hoped
that
most
tripel
style
would
be
similar
which
is
to
an
extent
but
far
off
from
the
smoothness
and
aftertaste
of
la
fin
du
monde
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
an
orange
tint
the
color
of
blush
on
an
apricot
a
finger
of
foam
that
fell
slowly
to
a
thin
skin
on
top
good
retention
and
lace
nose
is
malt
bread
caramel
banana
and
pear
some
apple
raisin
and
yeast
to
round
it
out
bubblegum
and
clove
pepper
and
faint
floral
malt
deepens
with
a
little
bread
as
it
warms
taste
is
banana
pear
a
little
acidic
pale
malt
and
honey
a
little
pepper
and
spice
on
the
back
palate
clove
really
comes
to
the
palate
as
it
warms
body
is
light
and
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
a
little
heavy
a
touch
of
grass
brings
the
hops
to
the
palate
in
the
finish
as
the
alcohol
leaves
warmth
and
dryness
to
offset
the
juicy
fruitiness
its
a
little
tart
and
tangy
but
the
bread
is
amazing
and
full
which
both
contribute
to
its
heaviness
i
thought
it
was
a
good
tripel
not
quite
subtle
but
well
done
nonetheless
after
all
a
tripel
is
for
sipping
not
slurping
overall
not
the
greatest
tripel
but
its
a
good
beer
complex
worth
a
try
flavor
is
extremely
fruit
forward
and
spicy
as
well
i
admire
the
complexity
but
some
sips
feel
a
bit
harsh
and
a
bit
more
balance
is
needed
perhaps
some
age
would
do
good
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
dissipated
relatively
quickly
the
nose
possesses
the
definite
essence
of
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
sour
but
generally
flat
and
uninspiring
there
is
some
residual
sweetness
on
the
finish
which
is
the
highlight
of
this
brew
0
very
nice
for
a
tripel
style
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
particularly
from
northeastern
breweries
o
not
my
favorite
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
american
example
of
the
tripel
style
and
the
rather
significant
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
much
more
of
a
sipping
beer
but
an
enjoyable
one
really
enjoying
this
i
do
get
the
slightest
hint
of
skunk
but
with
no
date
hard
to
tell
if
its
normal
still
this
is
one
to
enjoy
o
a
very
nice
triple
i
really
like
the
flavor
of
the
yeast
very
fruity
and
sweet
i
could
see
how
this
is
rated
one
of
the
top
triples
in
the
world
o
nice
example
of
the
style
o
well
they
got
a
lot
of
belgian
character
in
this
bottle
very
true
to
style
o
initially
taken
aback
and
puckered
somewhat
but
then
eased
into
it
more
warmed
well
naturally
and
proved
a
more
enjoyable
drink
than
i
expected
a
good
tripel
bottle
signed
by
the
brewer
himself
bottle
served
into
green
man
snifter
poured
a
hazy
golden
yelloworange
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
extremely
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
pacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
wad
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
wheat
spice
banana
runts
and
subtle
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
banana
wheat
spice
alcohol
and
subtle
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
the
nose
on
this
one
was
very
inviting
and
quite
complex
it
had
a
big
sweetness
and
spiciness
going
on
in
it
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
however
was
quite
hot
with
alcohol
and
honestly
took
me
back
really
wish
this
had
not
been
the
case
i
would
drink
this
one
again
in
the
future
but
aged
quite
a
bit
to
let
the
booze
settle
out
some
my
first
american
made
tripel
and
it
is
done
very
nicely
over
all
this
is
an
enthusiastic
even
exuberant
take
on
the
tripel
style
not
entirely
traditional
but
not
a
big
american
fruit
bomb
either
worth
the
experience
but
buy
a
single
not
the
sixpack
o
very
nice
tripel
has
the
right
aromas
and
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
nice
in
a
snifter
o
although
alcohol
is
abundant
in
this
brew
weyerbacher
did
a
fine
job
concealing
it
with
some
other
wonderful
flavors
and
aromas
i
enjoy
this
tripel
because
it
isnt
too
heavy
and
it
has
a
good
balance
of
flavors
its
not
too
sweet
yet
hops
are
barely
noticeable
id
have
this
tasty
beer
gain
and
look
forward
to
more
of
weyerbachers
creations
very
good
belgian
ale
here
not
totally
conventional
but
a
clever
incarnation
of
the
tripel
style
this
beer
pours
cloudy
and
flat
in
color
somewhere
between
straw
and
wheat
in
terms
oc
complexion
and
there
is
just
an
inch
of
thin
white
fizz
on
top
the
nose
is
very
fruity
like
golden
raisins
figs
and
candy
sugar
the
yeast
imparts
a
gentle
spice
character
as
well
which
is
more
apparent
in
the
flavor
than
the
smell
it
has
a
sweet
flavor
like
it
should
be
sugary
but
it
isnt
at
all
and
is
in
fact
dry
as
it
drinks
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
fruity
elements
blend
well
with
the
lighter
malt
profile
this
feels
more
like
a
summertime
drink
to
me
but
it
was
plenty
sessionable
in
the
middle
of
december
with
its
vibrant
carbonation
and
clean
finish
i
thought
the
body
was
a
tad
too
much
for
the
style
it
made
the
beer
seem
a
little
heavy
and
its
delicate
essence
was
trampled
on
a
little
bit
by
its
weight
but
even
with
that
criticism
i
thought
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
bottle
of
beer
overall
this
a
great
beer
for
drinking
on
an
easy
night
when
you
wanna
feel
it
but
take
it
easy
at
the
same
time
this
beer
seems
to
go
well
for
me
in
the
winter
months
as
it
almost
warms
you
up
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
got
a
lot
of
pear
and
green
apple
got
a
finger
of
white
head
decent
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
i
have
had
a
couple
so
that
could
effect
the
review
at
9
3
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
this
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
good
beer
overall
pretty
solid
tripel
and
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
check
out
thd
brewery
last
week
while
traveling
through
pa
poured
into
a
chalice
hazy
gold
with
a
small
lasting
white
head
aromas
of
straw
pear
pineapple
yeast
and
light
spice
palate
was
medium
bodied
and
smooth
flavors
of
straw
yeast
pear
pineapple
and
a
hint
oif
spice
with
a
smooth
lingering
fruity
finish
overall
lighter
than
most
i
have
had
in
the
style
and
also
more
complex
does
not
have
some
of
the
bittering
alcohol
that
i
usually
find
in
the
style
so
that
is
why
i
would
drink
this
one
sooner
than
most
i
like
the
banana
and
apricot
fruity
mix
overall
a
sweet
and
tasty
triple
with
quite
a
nice
flavor
profile
and
a
great
feel
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
and
a
fantastic
sipping
belgian
triple
a
very
nice
strong
golden
ale
glad
i
aged
this
one
it
is
a
slight
bit
on
the
tart
side
though
which
for
a
750
cork
bottle
makes
it
hard
to
finish
in
a
single
sitting
pours
a
hazy
blood
orange
visible
sediment
with
a
big
3
finger
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
full
of
fruitiness
apples
peaches
grapes
bubblegum
cotton
candy
and
hot
alcocol
all
mixed
in
lots
of
booze
on
the
tongue
banana
apples
and
grapes
finishes
dry
and
slightly
metallic
medium
bodied
crisp
tangy
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
triple
tons
of
fruity
esters
and
very
well
balanced
o
while
not
my
favorite
style
i
know
when
ive
got
a
great
tripel
on
my
hands
this
is
not
one
of
them
the
flavor
profile
is
too
muddled
and
its
too
hard
to
drink
worth
a
try
i
guess
but
dont
lose
sleep
looking
for
this
there
are
many
better
examples
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
some
nice
belgian
yeast
notes
as
well
as
some
grape
and
orange
notes
the
flavor
is
very
similar
i
get
some
nice
sweetness
from
the
candy
sugar
as
well
as
some
yeast
and
alcohol
notes
there
is
also
a
big
fruit
component
with
some
grapes
and
orange
notes
as
well
as
some
white
pepper
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
well
flavored
solid
offering
its
a
decent
tripel
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
which
slows
down
the
drinking
but
otherwise
its
a
rather
solid
tripel
o
the
flavor
is
more
on
point
than
the
nose
both
hit
the
right
points
for
style
there
are
other
golden
strongs
i
could
have
all
night
but
i
could
only
have
a
glass
of
this
in
a
sitting
though
i
will
definitely
have
another
some
other
day
pours
pale
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
smells
very
fruity
and
yeasty
that
carries
into
the
taste
as
well
slight
alcohol
flavor
highly
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
very
creamy
long
lasting
but
very
subtle
hoppyness
a
very
well
done
tripel
pours
a
medium
pale
golden
ale
with
a
thin
layer
of
white
fruity
smell
some
of
that
belgian
yeast
smell
strong
fruity
taste
cherries
that
rolls
into
a
maltyyeast
blend
unique
hoppy
close
with
some
lingering
bite
really
nails
the
style
very
admirably
done
overall
nice
kicked
up
tripel
alcohol
well
hidden
mellow
and
creamy
o
not
a
bad
tripel
not
a
great
one
either
this
might
be
a
good
intro
tripel
for
those
trying
to
get
into
belgium
styled
beers
o
fairly
complex
and
very
tasty
though
its
a
little
dangerous
how
easy
it
goes
down
which
is
fairly
typical
for
this
style
however
its
not
quite
and
complex
as
many
other
tripels
though
there
are
better
tripels
out
there
not
a
bad
one
to
try
good
tripel
lots
going
on
here
o
a
decent
effort
but
lacking
the
depth
of
character
to
make
it
great
not
my
favorite
tripel
ill
stick
to
la
fin
du
monde
for
my
tripels
made
this
side
of
the
atlantic
overall
this
was
an
extremely
tasty
tripel
with
a
nice
yeasty
citrus
flavor
that
along
with
the
multitude
of
other
flavors
did
a
somewhat
decent
job
of
masking
the
high
abv
making
this
brew
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
o
very
nice
probably
the
best
tripel
ive
had
to
date
other
than
fin
du
monde
reminds
me
of
fin
du
monde
from
unibroue
intense
flavors
and
a
little
over
the
top
but
quite
tasty
from
the
big
belgianstyle
bottle
purchased
at
a
certain
overpriced
organocentric
market
in
dc
o
this
is
fantastic
an
excellent
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
from
pa
its
all
there
wonderful
banana
yeastiness
sweet
sour
candied
citrus
and
fantastic
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
very
well
done
weyerbacher
o
this
tripel
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
although
it
is
a
beer
that
can
be
sipped
o
this
beer
seems
a
little
too
freshyoung
and
would
benefit
greatly
from
a
little
age
not
bad
now
but
laying
a
few
down
is
definitely
recommended
overall
this
is
certainly
a
delicious
tripel
from
a
brewery
that
continues
to
impress
a
little
lackluster
as
it
is
fairly
dominated
by
banana
but
still
a
great
beer
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
good
fare
and
certainly
fit
to
stand
with
any
of
its
belgian
kin
this
is
an
outstanding
trippel
i
only
wished
i
had
chilled
it
a
bit
o
merry
monks
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
9
3
abv
i
enjoy
the
complexity
of
fruits
and
spices
in
the
flavor
but
i
grow
tired
of
it
by
the
time
i
finish
it
isnt
bad
but
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
other
tripels
i
have
had
very
unimpressive
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
east
coast
breweries
and
tripels
are
one
of
my
cherished
styles
totally
out
of
balance
and
just
too
boozy
all
around
and
really
just
not
that
good
when
compared
to
the
better
of
the
same
style
out
there
wished
i
had
liked
it
more
but
just
didnt
o
a
good
tripel
overall
especially
from
an
american
brewery
it
is
pretty
unattractive
looking
and
could
use
a
lighter
body
but
its
quite
tasty
it
is
definitely
making
tripels
a
big
fan
of
mine
now
i
just
love
this
beer
excellent
creamy
mouthfeel
complex
flavors
beautiful
very
enjoyable
take
on
a
belgian
triple
that
is
too
drinkable
for
its
own
good
o
a
pretty
good
tripel
i
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
and
im
glad
i
did
would
buy
again
honestly
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
i
really
love
the
sweetness
thickness
and
spice
in
this
one
great
rendition
of
style
bottle
poured
into
a
tuliup

bright

capped
by

with

head
reduces
to
a
light

cap
light
biscuit
and
clove
in
the
nose
taste
is
clove
clove
and
more
clove
slight
biscuit
grass
and
the
alchohol
becomes
noticable
as
it
warms
mouth
is
full
bodied
and
quite
a
sipper
very
wellcrafted
brew
complex
but
with
a
high
drinkability
makes
for
a
great
sipper
and
definitely
worth
a
buy
what
sells
this
beer
for
me
is
the
taste
though
it
is
a
merry
beer
with
the
distinct
taste
of
pecans
and
pie
on
the
first
try
the
nutty
flavor
persists
throughout
and
rounds
this
highalcohol
ale
very
well
good
ole
times
come
forth
and
the
mind
drifts
away
with
the
merry
monk
this
is
some
good
stuff
another
worthy
reason
to
buy
the
big
beers
case
from
weyerbacher
however
this
delight
comes
on
draft
tonight
definitely
worth
the
drink

im
not

i
could
recommend
this
one
as
a
tripel

is
was
a
very
interesting
brew
tons
of
fruit
wheat
and
light
spices
hang
out
but
nothing
like
a
tripel
should
be
found

strange
sour

here

there
and
have
never
found
this
in
this
style
if
you
see
it
i
would
recommend
if
your
looking
for
a
fruit
beer
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
overall
a
bit
all
over
the

rather

with
the
boozy

a

not
enough
yeasty

this
is
really
a
good
beer
i
was
expecting
something
more
along
the
lines
of
a
bspa
but
in
reality
this
is
closer
to
a
tripel
imperial
wit
hybrid
if
thats
a
thing
its
good
fans
of
tripels
and
bspas
alike
should
try
this
beer
and
considering
the
pricepoint
this
is
a
really
good
buy
yaaay

highly
carbonated

and
tons
of

aromas
of

and
apricot
with

delicious
fruit
and

flavor
very
drinkable
im
wishing
id
bought
more
than
one
bottle
weyerbacher
really
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
quintessential
belgian
triple
d
very
flavorful
with
all
the
right
flavors
this
is
a
super
solid
american
made
tripel
that
is
nice
to
have
as
a
year
round
brew
odespite
of
the
spices
it
is
a
good
beer
if
the
spices
were
toned
down
a
little
bit
it
would
be
a
wonderful
beer
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
missing
something
compare
this
to
victorys
golden
monkey
with
its
nice
spicy
flavors
in
the
finish
to
see
what
weyerbacher
is
missing
out
on
alternately
it
would
make
a
great
base
for
a
winter
seasonal
if
the
right
spices
were
added
all
in
all
a
great
beer
personally
i
wouldnt
want
it
all
the
time
but
if
im
ever
in
the
mood
for
a
little
something
sweet
i
may
just
have
to
get
some
more
overall
this
beer
is
just
great
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
im
not
usually
a
tripel
fan
but
after
drinking
this
i
may
explore
the
style
a
little
more
every
time
i
set
it
down
im
tempted
to
pick
it
right
back
up
again
ill
definitely
be
reccomending
this
one
to
friends
o
there
is
a
ton
going
on
in
this
beer
and
all
of
it
good
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
changes
and
as
you
sip
it
more
aspects
of
the
flavor
come
out
i
would
love
to
set
one
of
these
down
and
see
what
a
few
years
does
for
it
but
even
now
it
is
really
great
another
solid
offering
from
weyerbacher
d
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
detectable
alcohol
in
the
taste
and
a
overall
lack
of
potent
flavor
is
a
turn
off
good
but
definitely
not
great
b
is
what
i
was
going
for
in
the
rating
department
since
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
the
numbers
really
mean
at
this
point
o
a
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
tripel
would
certainly
have
this
again
o
a
solid
tripel
definitely
recommend
picking
it
up
o
very
solid
tripel
not
my
favorite
but
its
quite
good
recommended
dr
easy
and
delicious
despite
the
high
abv
pretty
awesome
actually
i
just
wish
i
knew
what
was
wrong
with
the
nose
on
this
otherwise
quite
delicious
this
is
a
very
welldone
tripel
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
as
its
far
too
sweet
for
my
personal
palate
but
a
good
representation
of
it
tripel
fans
should
be
satisfied
decent
triple
i
have
had
only
a
few
that
blew
me
out
of
the
water
and
this
does
not
however
still
a
good
brew
and
would
order
again
served
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
thinwalled
hofbräuhaus
pint
glass
overall
what
was
this
it
smelled
like
some
kind
of
imperial
hefe
and
tasted
really
overspiced
and
unbalanced
this
is
faaar
from
the
top
tripels
especially
la
fin
du
monde
its
a
weird
beer
and
pretty
unpleasant
o
good
beer
solid
for
drinking
casually
or
during
a
dinner
taste
of
cherries
and
malt
alcohol
is
deff
there
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
it
is
a
nice
sipping
beer
great
for
desert
or
on
a
nice
cold
night
not
much
of
a
session
brew
as
you
can
imagine
id
buy
again
drink
pretty
boozy
and
astringent
nail
polish
but
the
balance
and
abv
holds
it
together
a
little
unbalanced
not
the
best
tripel
but
if
you
want
boozy
and
tripel
together
found
your
beer
crazy
monks
the
color
is
lighter
than
you
would
expect
but
the
taste
is
dark
sweet
and
yeasty
as
it
should
be
recommended
for
a
taste
ay
time
you
want
a
heavy
tripel
compares
favorably
with
belgians
from
belgium
better
than
many
poured
from
bottle
to
glass
very
little
head
nice
amount
of
bubbles
this
brew
has
a
strong
alcohol
odoralmost
like
wine
nice
copperyorange
color
warm
boozy
finish
the
further
i
drink
the
more
it
tastes
of
wine
this
would
fair
well
with
a
nice
slice
of
pie
on
a
cold
winters
eve
a
few
of
these
and
youll
be
couched
for
sure
glad
i
got
a
sample
and
not
a
full
glass
overbearing
and
hot
with
loads
of
spicy
and
fruity
tones
too
much
complex
interesting
but
not
for
a
hot
day
olike
many
tripels
ive
had
this
is
a
fairly
harsh
beer
meaning
that
it
really
doesnt
go
down
too
easily
its
actually
fairly
difficult
to
finish
i
doubt
ill
be
getting
this
one
again
nor
do
i
recommend
it

o

very
drinkable

the

a
beautiful

other

very

and
nothing
really
sticks
out
the
taste
is
good
but
not
quite
as
balanced
as
the
nose
its
almost
really
good
but
not
quite
this
falls
short
of
the
best
in
style
but
its
still
top
4
or
so
american
tripels
ive
had
it
improves
as
it
warms
however
massively
feel
is
a
little
dry
and
carbonated
for
my
taste
on
the
style
its
probably
the
weak
point
for
this
brew
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
tripel
and
i
would
have
it
again
unfortunately
its
really
easy
to
get
world
class
belgian
tripels
around
washington
dc
so
i
dont
know
when
i
would
pick
this
up
definitely
check
it
out
if
you
havent
though
another
solid
brew
from
weyerbacher
d
a
fairly
good
tripel
but
the
burn
reduces
the
drinkability
o
bad
ass
beer
great
name
i
am
definitely
in
a
merry
mood
weyerbacher
does
not
disappoint
i
had
verboten
belgian
pale
ale
before
which
would
be
the
little
brother
to
merry
monk
and
was
satisfied
but
this
takes
the
brewery
to
a
whole
other
level
glad
i
was
able
to
sip
on
this
one
o
this
is
excellent
even
by
true
belgian
standards
plenty
of
complexity
wellbalanced
flavors
fine
finish
and
aftertaste
highly
recommended
for
u
s
fans
of
tripels
d
i
love
this
tripel
my
favorite
offering
from
weyerbacher
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
savored
excellent
flavor
i
think
this
will
be
a
good
extra
when
i
trade
for
anyone
who
cant
get
weyerbacher
great
beer
great
price
and
underrated
but
again
probably
for
true
to
style
points
o
the
sour
lemon
wasnt
as
dominating
as
you
drank
this
one
it
still
covers
up
a
lot
of
the
yeast
character
o
if
this
came
in
a
mason
jar
with
three
xs
on
the
front
i
would
watch
out
for
lost
eyesight
since
it
doesnt
however
this
belgian
twist
on
moonshine
cider
is
surprisingly
pleasing
overall
one
of
the
better
attempts
at
a
belgian
style
by
an
american
brewery
a
solid
beer
not
great
but
still
pretty
good
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
o
a
tripel
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
very
balanced
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
profile
hard
to
find
a
better
tripel
available
in
six
packs
a
great
bargain
and
beer
o
a
solid
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
do
not
know
much
of
this
is
certainly
not
a
knock
your
socks
off
revolutionary
beer
but
it
sure
as
hell
isnt
shabby
either
good
stuff
o
seemed
to
deviate
a
bit
much
for
my
liking
in
the
style
have
had
plenty
of
over
american
versions
and
liked
them
a
lot
more
final
thoughts
im
not
a
tripel
guy
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
not
alot
on
the
nose
but
its
strong
on
what
it
has
it
seems
the
only
guff
i
have
is
with
the
dying
head
the
first
wass
merry
monks
ale
from
weyerbacher
brewing
co
its
a
tripel
take
my
car
keys
that
is
yelloworange
with
a
thick
white
head
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
fruit
flavors
i
couldnt
quite
place
something
like
banana
the
hops
are
more
citrusy
than
floral
and
are
pretty
strong
i
liked
it
very
much
even
though
tripels
and
doubels
arent
my
thing
i
have
definitely
had
better
belgian
strong
ales
however
it
was
nicely
done
had
to
try
this
one
for
the
sake
of
the
hype
and
the
prospect
of
solid
american
belgians
that
are
just
straight
up
hard
to
do
and
time
consuming
looks
the
part
for
sure
and
feels
the
part
yeast
formation
in
palate
is
most
definitely
american
with
fruits
that
would
symbolize
harsh
esters
in
other
beers
like
banana
not
particularly
spiced
to
comp
that
still
broad
but
tight
as
a
triple
should
be
belgian
sugar
cane
esters
light
wheat
silk
feel
palate
doesnt
insinuate
banana
as
much
crisp
mild
wheat
marzipan
hints
abv
is
undetectable
which
for
some
can
mean
success
its
a
strength
but
may
make
it
one
dimensional
for
some
i
thought
this
was
a
very
flavorful
beer
though
it
was
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
overall
c
ogood
solid
representation
of
the
style
o
not
bad
a
pretty
good
tripel
overall
decent
but
compaired
to
other
tripels
this
is
too
mild
and
plain
needs
more
spices
and
hops
to
add
complex
flavors
worth
a
drink
but
nothing
special
cheers
to
dan
w
chris
w
dan
h
and
all
the
guys
down
in
easton
good
stuff
overall
a
heavy
tripel
that
misses
the
mark
but
it
tastes
decent
just
not
what
i
was
looking
for
in
this
beer
be
warned
that
this
beer
has
two
faces
if
you
dont
pour
it
slowly
then
you
will
end
up
with
a
hefeweisen
sort
of
beer
i
made
this
mistake
on
the
first
bottle
out
of
the
six
pack
in
my
opinion
it
is
much
more
enjoyable
without
the
yeast
try
it
both
ways
though
its
quite
interesting
o
good
but
la
fin
du
monde
is
a
better
example
overall
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
americanized
tripel
by
no
means
the
best
i
have
ever
had
but
a
fine
offering
from
a
reputable
brewery
worth
the
low
investment
but
not
a
must
have
by
any
means
had
this
ontap
at
an
unos
pizza
in
hamilton
nj
it
was
served
too
cold
but
they
did
put
in
in
the
right
type
of
glass
despite
starting
off
a
bit
too
chilled
for
a
tripel
it
was
tasting
quite
fine
alhough
i
was
getting
more
on
the
fruitfloral
side
rather
the
malt
i
did
noticed
as
it
warmed
a
bit
the
alcohol
became
more
prominent
to
the
point
of
being
a
bit
distractive
not
up
there
with
the
best
belgians
but
that
wouldnt
stop
me
from
drinking
it
again
overall
straight
down
the
middle
tripel
for
me
cant
say
id
want
to
have
this
again
but
theres
worse
out
there
for
sure
cheers
poured
into
my
bruery
snifter
golden
in
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
lingers
aroma
of
bread
citrus
and
ginger
taste
follows
the
nose
sweet
bit
not
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
average
nothing
special
here
would
take
a
golden
monkey
over
this
anyday
this
mediumbodied
brew
has
a
moderate
carbonation
and
is
plenty
smooth
while
also
consistently
crisp
owith
every
tripel
i
try
i
grow
to
love
them
more
and
more
this
is
no
exception
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
bublegum
but
its
not
so
heavy
on
the
tongue
after
an
intial
sweetness
a
a
subtle
peppery
note
finishes
the
beer
thanks
again

that
leaves
a
thin
layer
of
foam
big
smells
of
bananas
and
cloves
with
a
boozy
smell
as
well
very
smooth
taste
for
a
triple
the
drinkability
is
definitely
there
despite
the
high
abv
slight
spicy
taste
with
a
minty
feel
as
well
silk
mouthfeel
dry
aftertaste
very
good
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
would
have
liked
a
little
more
zest
to
the
taste
though
could
have
seen
it
being
more
of
a
belgian
strong
golden
ale
than
a
tripel
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
looks
just
like
a
tripel
should
as
this
golden
lighter
yellow
with
a
white
soapy
head
head
does
not
really
stick
around
smells
of
belgian
yeast
spice
and
lemony
citrus
a
little
bit
of
banana
is
in
there
as
well
taste
is
exactly
the
same
with
some
nice
citrus
and
banana
notes
wrapped
in
spicy
belgian
yeast
well
carbonated
and
mediumbodied
not
the
most
complex
tripel
but
really
solid
overall
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
while
it
isnt
exceptional
in
any
aspect
it
isnt
bad
in
any
of
them
either
it
does
everything
well
quite
enjoyable
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
anyone
thanks
to
jparkanzky
for
the
extra
overall
drinkability
is
superb
as
with
the
other
american
tripel
i
had
at
this
bar
allagash
curieux
so
fresh
chuggable
enjoyable
well
balanced
utterly
delightful
and
so
perfect
for
the
warm
latespring
weather
again
witness
how
america
can
brew
belgians
with
the
best
of
them
o
pretty
good
tripel
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
again
but
there
are
better
to
be
had
d
an
ok
beer
but
i
will
not
be
having
another
3
5
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
golden
beer
i
reccommend
picking
it
up
if
you
find
it
od
overall
a
good
tripel
abv
is
hidden
sneaks
up
on
you
not
overly
filling
overall
very
good
tripel
easily
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
from
my
favorite
brewer
while
the
abv
is
high
it
isnt
obvious
in
the
taste
when
you
see
two
empty
bottles
in
front
of
you
surrender
your
keys
smells
sweet
but
doesnt
taste
too
sweet
which
is
a
welcome
surprise
also
the
deep
snifter
glass
allowed
me
to
agitate
and
swirl
the
beer
a
lot
helping
the
aromas
and
flavors
come
out
the
only
thing
stopping
this
beer
from
getting
all
5s
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
perfect
beer
pours
a
light
amber
with
yeast
floating
all
throughout
the
smell
is
your
atypical
belgian
tripel
the
taste
is
super
sweet
almost
laffy
taffy
sweet
of
belgian
yeast
and
banana
and
cloves
not
the
best
triple
not
even
top
3
but
9
3
abv
available
in
a
6pack
for
a
reasonable
price
how
can
you
not
like
it
overall
i
couldnt
believe
how
much
flavor
was
there
mainly
because
in
my
head
the
beer
was
going
to
suck
thank
goodness
for
happy
surprises
and
this
beer
was
one
of
them
merry
monks
is
one
of
the
best
year
round
releases
that
weyerbacher
has
i
think
this
beer
on
its
own
can
show
what
the
brewery
is
capable
of
doing
the
beer
pours
as
a
bright
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
billowy
head
on
it
the
head
releases
some
fresh
aromas
of
belgian
yeast
some
citrus
fruits
and
even
a
little
clove
might
be
in
there
the
taste
is
refreshing
its
got
some
nice
citrus
bite
that
mellows
out
into
an
earthy
brew
as
it
warms
up
this
beer
has
a
good
mouthfeel
too
its
on
the
lighter
side
but
still
has
enough
body
to
not
really
feel
watered
down
this
brew
is
a
pretty
solid
american
version
of
the
classic
belgian
style
i
must
note
that
i
let
the
rest
of
the
big
bottle
cool
down
some
before
enjoying
it
and
it
really
helped
the
hide
the
heat
without
cutting
down
too
much
on
the
flavors
i
would
say
that
if
you
live
in
weyerbachers
distribution
area
and
want
an
affordable
but
tasty
tripel
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
go
for
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
ive
been
happy
with
all
the
beers
from
weyerbacher
that
ive
tried
so
far
if
you
like
belgian
ales
and
monks
then
youll
enjoy
this
one
finish
sweet
grains
with
hints
of
coriander
overall
nicely
done
a
good
take
on
this
style
by
a
local
brewery
drinkablility
i
have
always
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
drinkable
to
me
it
maintains
the
perfect
balance
between
being
sweet
and
having
spice
on
the
finish
to
dry
things
up
the
alcohol
is
to
me
very
well
hidden
and
presents
nothing
but
a
nice
warming
presence
to
me
in
terms
of
both
value
and
overall
quality
this
is
total
homerun
if
you
compare
this
to
many
other
beers
of
the
style
its
quite
a
nice
choice
i
recommend
as
one
my
favorite
beers
from
the
brewery
and
of
american
triples
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
really
nice
drinking
pretty
refreshing
and
decent
masked
alcohol
definitely
something
id
drink
again
o
a
really
surprising
and
delicious
beer
a
solid
tripel
therefore
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
especially
in
the
750ml
corked
bottle
o
i
love
this
beer
even
though
its
a
high
abv
i
could
drink
23
without
really
noticing
a
much
try
and
a
goto
tripel
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
about
average
for
the
style
drinkability
was
decent
it
had
some
good
flavors
for
the
style
and
was
pretty
easy
drinking
considering
the
abv
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
not
outstanding
in
the
style
the
body
was
about
average
for
the
style
drinkability
was
good
but
will
depend
on
how
much
you
like
the
clove
aspect
overall
a
decent
beer
that
id
have
occasionally
if
it
were
local
to
me
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
this
is
a
big
sipper
go
easy
well
done
for
an
american
tripel
i
would
buy
a
few
packs
of
this
a
year
if
it
was
a
local
smooth
and
quite
fruity
very
tasty
refreshing
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
inoffensive
awesome
merry
monks
with
its
front
label
picturing
a
trio
of
goofing
around
monks
is
at
first
kinda
silly
to
take
in
but
on
further
review
theyre
acting
silly
for
a
reason
theyre
happy
and
jolly
and
of
course
merry
and
for
good
reason
this
tripel
is
great
and
if
you
love
the
style
this
comes
highly
recommended
dm
great
flavor
could
have
used
more
carbonation
but
overall
a
very
good
belgian
variation
d
enjoyable
not
quite
at
the
level
of
good
trappists
but
just
a
hair
shy
sure
makes
a
cheese
quesadilla
with
kraft
singles
taste
like
magic
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
but
i
dont
think
that
i
will
be
buying
again
a
beer
that
i
used
to
frown
on
when
i
purchased
the
weyerbacher
big
beer
mix
case
in
the
pass
no
its
one
of
the
one
i
appreciate
and
a
damn
good
reason
to
pull
the
case
only
a
couple
will
have
you
feeling
merry
d
aawesome
triple
with
some
spectacular
flavors
and
i
would
most
certainly
search
this
beer
out
again
d
one
of
the
spicier
tripels
in
recent
memory
but
still
a
decent
example
of
the
style
weyerbacher
is
great
at
making
solid
versions
of
high
gravity
styles
this
makes
me
want
this
brewery
sold
in
my
state
a
little
bit
more
too
strong
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
notes
hmmm
not
my
fav
style
or
fav
brew
but
it
feels
pretty
good
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
could
work
very
well
on
a
social
setting
as
good
regional
brew
to
get
the
people
going
im
going
to
store
up
a
big
bottle
of
this
golden
yellow
in
color
and
hazy
with
a
thin
white
head
that
cleared
quickly
belgian
yeast
and
sweet
banana
aromas
dominate
with
hints
of
pear
hay
and
a
touch
of
coriander
sweet
malty
belgian
flavors
with
lots
of
banana
and
a
clean
finish
a
light
spice
flavor
seems
to
build
near
the
finish
but
never
really
surfaced
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
with
pleasant
carbonation
and
buttery
smoothness
spices
and
alcoholic
heat
intensified
as
this
warmed
up
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
belgian
ale
d
some
bitter
hop
character
w
stronger
malt
backbone
spicy
quality
is
a
bit
overwhelming
doverall
tasty
and
refreshing
a
bit
sweet
for
the
style
which
makes
it
more
drinkable
than
typical
but
the
high
abv
should
slow
most
of
us
down
try
it
for
sure
overall
its
a
nice
beer
that
takes
some
big
chances
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
by
making
it
a
bit
too
malty
but
combining
it
with
sort
of
a
super
fruity
juice
like
flavor
kind
of
makes
it
fall
flat
of
great
d
interesting
tripel
quite
a
bit
going
on
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
that
kind
of
surprised
me
this
is
definitely
drinkable
if
weyerbacher
can
make
a
tripel
like
this
i
want
to
get
my
hands
on
some
of
their
quads
all
in
all
this
is
a
nice
american
made
belgian
drinkability
i
could
actually
drink
a
few
of
these
i
love
tripels
myself
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
so
this
could
be
a
very
dangerous
beer
for
that
reason
have
a
few
too
many
and
they
can
ruin
your
night
i
find
it
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
and
will
keep
some
on
hand
d
this
is
yet
another
very
fine
brew
from
weyerbacher
is
was
a
great
brew
on
new
years
eve
pours
a
nice
somewhat
cloudy
amber
with
a
thick
fluffy
somewhat
persistent
white
head
aroma
is
malty
fruity
and
just
a
bit
yeasty
flavor
is
definitely
somewhat
better
than
i
expected
strong
malty
fruity
yeasty
a
bit
rubbery
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
most
enjoyable
and
lipsmacking
texture
is
fairly
smooth
somewhat
fizzy
leaving
a
subtle
tingle
this
is
worth
seeking
this
is
a
big
beer
at
over
9
abv
and
it
feels
a
little
too
boozey
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
it
is
definitely
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
weyerbacher
a
yellowgold
hue
it
produces
a
nice
thick
soft
sliky
foamy
head
on
the
pour
with
good
retention
the
smell
reveals
whats
perhaps
its
most
feature
real
potent
banana
esters
but
more
like
a
greasy
banana
chip
as
opposed
to
fresh
flesh
or
peel
and
its
quite
inviting
and
truly
dominates
the
aromas
and
flavors
which
both
lack
pronounced
phenol
or
alcohol
presence
meaning
all
you
have
to
cope
with
here
is
a
tasty
moderately
malty
in
sweetness
and
body
mildly
banana
fruity
belgianstyle
ale
poor
thing
the
drinking
is
smooth
and
somewhat
substantial
for
the
style
and
even
as
it
warms
up
the
alcohol
only
weakly
bites
yes
its
flavorful
and
satisfying
quite
excellent
multiple
beergasms
got
a
case
of
the
weyerbacher
big
beers
and
cant
wait
to
get
thru
the
case
all
weyerbacher
brews
are
always
great
love
to
treat
myself
and
this
is
the
perfect
christmas
gift
to
me
from
me
d
this
is
a
delicious
tripel
with
a
pleasant
spiciness
and
quite
the
warming
sensation
overall
a
very
nice
beer
but
with
some
flaws
certainly
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
theres
some
things
i
would
change
or
do
differently
for
the
price
point
there
are
others
out
there
that
i
would
try
but
for
a
little
bit
less
i
could
definitely
buy
it
again
d
a
very
complex
beer
with
plenty
going
on
to
please
my
taste
buds
goes
down
dangerously
smooth
for
an
almost
10
abv
i
had
the
12
oz
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
to
cork
and
cage
version
based
on
this
bottle
d
only
the
abv
keeps
it
limited
to
a
few
at
a
sitting
otherwise
session
all
you
want
and
get
a
designated
driver
d
drinkability
is
moderate
while
i
found
myself
drinking
this
quick
often
taking
multiple
sips
in
vain
to
differentiate
some
flavors
if
this
were
toned
down
on
the
sweetness
and
amped
in
complexity
i
could
see
this
as
easily
and
foolishly
quaffable
this
beer
has
a
nice
golden
straw
color
to
it
with
a
thin
white
head
that
vanishes
quickly
to
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
smell
is
nice
and
fruity
and
a
little
malty
the
taste
is
kinda
fruity
it
is
like
a
banana
not
much
else
going
on
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
heavy
but
not
to
much
and
is
very
drinkable
d
a
solid
beer
overall
but
just
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
liking
almost
like
a
spiced
up
syrup
the
body
doesnt
help
it
either
this
ones
worth
a
try
but
i
wish
id
served
at
around
35f
instead
of
45f
a
bit
too
thick
at
the
higher
temperature
deep

very
nicely

md
alcohol
is
hidden
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
you
can
feel
it
in
the
mouth
leaves
a
nice
tingle
but
a
bit
of
a
sour
puss
also
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
intense
on
this
one
but
this
is
definitely
a
tripel
id
have
again
it
is
a
bit
thicker
than
im
used
to
for
the
style
and
it
works
abv
is
very
well
hiddenblended
moreys
bottom
line
ive
always
wanted
to
try
this
being
that
im
a
fan
of
weyerbacher
but
i
never
wanted
to
purchase
an
entire
sixer
being
that
im
not
really
that
into
most
belgians
its
pretty
good
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
its
smoother
than
i
expected
that
being
said
theres
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
every
so
often
i
come
across
a
belgian
that
wows
me
but
this
one
is
just
well
done
tastes
was
majorly
consistant
with
the
smell
only
had
a
brutally
sour
finish
and
imo
a
varried
aray
of
dry
not
compatable
fruit
flavour
with
pear
really
leading
the
way
three
finger
tight
bubbles
off
white

on

smells
of

pear
plum

and
sweet

tastes
are
that
of
currant
pear
plum
clover
honey
and
malt
creamy
and
full
of
body
in
my
mouth
and
back
of
my
throat
very
pleasurable
balance
of
flavors
maybe
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
but
well
worth
the
price
i
have
had
this
a
few
times
in
the
past
and
decided
to
revisit
it
the
appearance
is
a
thick
honey
color
with
a
small
head
i
taste
candied
fruit
vanilla
and
a
herbal
quality
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
carbonation
about
right
but
it
seems
to
leave
a
metallic
quality
drinkability
however
is
above
average
the
alcohol
is
masked
and
this
offering
from
weyerbacher
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
merry
monks
is
a
good
tripel
from
a
us
brewer
but
there
are
other
domestic
examples
that
warrant
greater
attention
in
my
opinion
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
it
could
have
been
so
much
better
if
it
was
wellbalanced
the
smell
had
me
sold
but
the
flavor
quickly
fades
from
quite
good
to
not
so
good
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
particularly
the
feel
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
aroma
however
its
harshness
of
flavor
really
does
detract
from
the
experience
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
again
i
plan
to
hold
one
of
these
for
a
few
months
it
was
a
complex
brew
that
could
be
pretty
awesome
after
some
age
to
blend
the
flavors
oh
man
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
it
poors
well
i
nice
golden
straw
color
with
half
a
finger
head
in
a
chimay
chalice
the
smell
is
strongly
bready
and
yeasty
the
taste
the
same
with
some
clove
banana
and
grassiness
to
it
when
cold
there
was
a
strong
metallic
taste
it
goes
down
smooth
hiding
the
alcohol
very
well
i
can
keep
drinking
these
but
the
taste
is
nothing
special
pours
golden
with
a
bit
of
visible
carbonation
white
head
and
a
good
deal
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
quite
a
bit
of
spice
along
with
a
good
deal
of
booze
a
bit
of
banana
and
clove
in
the
background
a
bit
of
a
twist
light
fruits
as
well
taste
is
fairly
boozy
with
some
fruit
and
spice
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
a
it
cloying
with
sweetness
and
some
booze
drinks
fairly
well
but
is
a
bit
unorganized
in
the
end
goes
down
as
easy
as
a
9
beer
will
do
but
cant
hold
up
against
the
belgians
nothing
worth
writing
home
about
but
definitely
not
a
sour
note
in
weyerbachers
repertoire
at
6
99
probably
worth
it
if
you
havent
tried
it
i
would
go
back
but
not
a
noteworthy
buy
overall
this
is
a
really
good
traditional
style
triple

drinkable
and
flavorful

a

at

its
a
pretty
decent
beer
gives
you
a
nice
aftertaste
too
clearly
not
a
session
beer
though
dthis
is
well
balanced
and
quite
refreshing
the
feel
is
great
and
the
balance
of
sweet
and
spice
is
well
done
this
is
a
tasty
brew
that
has
a
nice
complexity
to
it
d
good
drinkability
here
belgians
are
a
once
in
awhile
beer
for
me
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
cant
really
go
too
wrong
with
weyerbacher
d
decent
the
wonderful
flavors
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
of
this
you
can
pretty
much
tell
youre
drinking
a
9
beer
but
this
is
really
good
overall
a
solid
example
of
a
tripel
from
an
american
craft
brewer
this
beer
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
rather
small
head
it
smells
spicey
and
like
most
other
belgin
tripes
tasted
of
a
very
traditional
tripel
a
bit
more
spicey
then
usuall
though
as
always
a
nice
strong
taste
but
still
easy
to
drink
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
to
special
but
would
get
again
bottle
belgian
yeast
smell
along
with
some
dark
fruit
aromas
poured
a
pale
yellow
clear
with
sedimentfloaties
in
it
even
though
we
didnt
really
shake
the
bottle
all
that
much
slight
head
taste
is
ok
with
the
bananafruityeast
notes
highlighted
ends
rather
with
a
slight
bitterness
d
a
good
beer
to
savor
and
sip
but
at
over
9
abv
its
not
one
you
want
to
have
more
than
1
or
2
of
in
a
given
night
tripels
used
to
be
my
favorite
beers
but
now
theyre
down
the
list
a
bit
this
one
is
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
current
tastes
and
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
complementary
flavors
to
balance
the
sweetness
the
beer
pours
a
striking
gold
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
dont
get
a
whole
lot
on
the
nose
just
some
light
honey
clove
and
a
hint
of
citrus
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
much
more
impressive
its
fairly
sweet
and
seems
to
be
dominated
by
flavors
of
clove
and
honey
however
there
is
some
underlying
citrus
and
spice
that
i
think
adds
to
and
enhances
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
to
full
but
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
its
not
the
least
bit
heavy
or
tiring
on
the
palate
ultimately
i
thought
drinkability
was
pretty
good
in
this
beer
though
given
the
amount
of
richnesssweetness
im
not
sure
i
could
ever
drink
more
than
one
in
any
event
another
very
solid
beer
from
the
folks
at
weyerbacher
d
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
triple
certainly
a
sipping
beer
good
with
a
great
meal
actually
used
some
of
it
in
a
mushroom
cream
glaze
for
my
steak
tonight
very
nice
d
decent
beer
do
not
know
if
i
would
buy
again
m
d
good
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
for
its
etoh
future
outlook
a
decent
enjoyable
tripel
that
came
free
thanks
to
a
buddy
socked
away
a
few
for
aging
so
ill
reserve
full
judgment
until
those
get
sampled
overall
merry
monks
golden
ale
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
its
easily
drinkable
is
right
on
target
with
the
characteristics
of
a
tripel
although
not
the
best
rated
one
available
on
the
market
it
still
hits
the
spot
id
go
with
a
strong
cheese
to
counteract
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
or
a
nicely
done
beef
of
some
sort
the
beer
pours
a
murky
tangerine
with
a
voluminous
off
white
head
retention
is
good
but
lacing
is
nonexistent
which
is
inexcusable
for
the
style
the
nose
consists
almost
entirely
of
juicy
fruity
pale
malts
but
its
a
bit
weak
bubblegum
sweet
malts
open
each
sip
followed
by
a
brief
blast
of
intense
spiciness
before
an
overbearing
alcoholic
heat
takes
over
to
finish
as
the
beer
wamrs
the
boozy
quality
fades
to
an
acceptable
level
and
yields
to
the
yeast
induced
spiciness
though
it
never
disappears
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
the
carbonation
is
a
touch
on
the
high
side
the
harsh
alcohol
taste
at
lower
serving
temperatures
slowed
me
down
and
left
the
majority
of
the
beer
to
be
enjoyed
warmer
and
better
average
it
out
and
drinkability
is
alright
merry
monks
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
plenty
of
tripels
out
there
a
fair
bit
better
than
this
one
d
a
good
tripel
but
not
in
the
upper
tier
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
not
as
clean
as
this
style
demands
but
it
is
still
good
and
an
enjoyable
brew
with
nice
peppery
melonlight
fruit
character
and
good
feel

average

and

plus

twelve

any
more
would
be
a
chore
for

weyerbacher
merry
monks
is
a
very
lively
hazy
golden
ale
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
fuity
spicy
aroma
with
notes
of
banana
tropical
fruit
earth
and
barnyard
its
medium
maybe
mediumlight
bodied
and
very
fluffy
and
bubbly
in
the
mouth
the
finish
is
soft
clean
and
very
dry
it
has
a
very
phenolic
flavor
its
almost
meaty
the
fruity
tones
are
not
as
prominent
in
the
taste
as
they
are
in
the
aroma
the
phenols
stop
just
short
of
tasting
like
bandaids
theres
the
slightest
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
its
a
pretty
good
belgian
session
ale
kind
of
along
the
lines
of
orval
or
something
d
i
really
like
this
brew
im
not
very
exposed
to
the
style
have
had
victorys
golden
monkey
and
the
chimay
and
thats
it
im
a
big
fan
of
dubbels
but
im
not
very
familiar
with
tripels
or
quads
yet
but
this
tripel
is
damn
good
the
best
ive
had
of
the
three
so
far
ill
be
exploring
this
style
some
more
very
soon
drinkability
decent
tripel
overall
but
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
trumped
by
many
others
available
worth
trying
maybe
not
worth
seeking
out
again
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
ill
chalk
it
up
to
thatmaybe
compared
to
other
similar
styled
beers
this
was
quite
a
disappointment
overall
decent
belgian
but
nothing
crazy
it
doesnt
represent
a
tripel
very
will
with
all
the
booze
showing
and
i
cant
stress
that
enough
this
is
a
very
slow
sipper
drinking
a
full
bottle
would
be
a
task
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
two
finger
white
head
fades
to
a
thin
layer
spotty
lace
smell
spicy
lots
of
sweet
pale
greenish
banana
a
splash
of
spicy
leafy
hops
taste
sweet
pale
malt
pear
some
unfiltered
apple
juice
spicy
and
grainy
a
touch
of
banana
and
wheat
tang
a
little
booze
something
is
a
little
off
not
sure
what
it
is
the
slight
tang
and
the
hopping
maybe
but
fairly
tasty
light
bodied
fairly
low
carbonation
drying
and
sweet
finish
drinkability
is
good
as
well
nice
example
of
the
style
the
price
isnt

drinkability
i
had
this
at
a
weyerbacher
tasting
in
charlotte
with
chris
wilson
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
most
of
all
the
weyerbacher
products
d
i
cant
quite
place
my
finger
on
it
but
the
whole
isnt
quite
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
part
perhaps
a
bit
too
boozy
and
medicinal
not
a
bad
offering
but
not
in
the
running
in
terms
of
memorable
tripel
or
weyerbacher
offerings
some
aging
might
actually
aid
to
mellow
this
one
out
and
tame
it
a
bit
weyerbacher
shines
w
this
one
this
is
a
unique
twist
on
a
pale
ale
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
hops
less
sweet
and
it
could
be
really
good
a
nice
medium
body
with
a
bitter
mouth
feel
that
surprisingly
isnt
too
over
the
top

abv
weyerbacher
has
pulled
it
off
by
offering
up
a
great
tasting
brewwhich
reminds
me
of
franziskaners
weissbier
but
much
strongerthat
at
least
matches
if
not
out
does
the
high
level
of
alcohol
that
little
kick
in
the
mouthfeel
pulls
down
the
drinkability
as
well
the
high
abv
also
makes
this
seem
a
little
hot
and
almost
distracts
from
the
feeling
as
well
one
to
enjoy
and
enjoy
one
though
this
is
9
3
it
doesnt
taste
it
at
all
i
could
find
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
without
realizing
it
d
a
different
take
on
the
style
but
it
was
not
unpleasant
interesting
is
a
good
way
to
describe
it
perhaps
it
is
a
bit
too
fresh
d
the
high
abv
says
that
you
should
not
have
too
many
but
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
not
too
many
cuz
its
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
but
i
could
drink
2
or
3
of
these
in
a
night
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruit
spices
some
alcohol
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
great
fruits
spices
yeast
very
well
balanced
and
delicious
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
brew
hazy
gold
color
with
a
good
bit
of
head
never
would
have
expected
such
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
abv
of
9
3
couldnt
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
its
a
decent
beer
but
to
me
nothing
really
too
exciting
about
it
to
me
a
bit
pale
in
comparison
to
some
other
triples
ive
enjoyed
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
2
finger
head
that
falls
very
quickly
nice
nose
of
ripe
bananas
spice
and
honey
also
a
noticeable
alcohol
burn
in
the
nose
the
flavours
hit
hard
on
the
palate
all
of
the
scents
translate
well
to
the
taste
with
the
warm
alcohol
making
its
presence
well
known
also
a
touch
of
toasted
malts
present
high
carbonation
as
well
making
for
a
crisp
fresh
mouthfeel
overall
a
bit
boozy
for
my
taste
might
be
too
young
but
with
no
bottle
date
theres
no
way
to
tell
d
wonderfully
drinkable
this
beer
is
a
good
american
version
of
a
great
traditional
style
it
is
meant
to
be
savored
pours
from
the
12
ounce
bottle
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
big
longlasting
rocky
offwhite
head
smells
fruity
and
sweet
with
hints
of
green
apple
highly
carbonated
lightly
spicy
and
easy
drinking
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
one
a
good
but
not
great
american
tripel
very
drinkable
a
good
triple
though
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
nice
consistancy
well
rounded
beer
with
a
decent
drinkibility
when
considering
this
is
a
whopping
9
3
good
taste
but
gets
a
little
monotonous
half
way
through
strangely
comes
back
around
again
at
the
end
though
and
finishes
clean
kinda
nice
big
fan
of
weyerbacher
and
this
is
another
good
one
but
theyve
done
better
ie
zotten
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
when
im
looking
for
a
good
tripel
admittedly
not
my
favorite
that
packs
an
overhand
right
to
the
face
or
if
im
trapped
in
a
monastery
and
want
to
get
drunk
either
way
good
stuff
here
im
not
going
to
bore
you
with
the
usual
i
just
wanted
to
jump
on
here
and
say
that
i
had
a
belgian
bottle
sized
helping
of
the
monks
and
all
i
can
say
is
it
wasnt
my
favorite
it
had
great
potential
with
its
initial
sweetness
but
it
turns
dry
and
fusal
half
way
through
however
i
imagine
if
you
prefer
your
tripels
to
be
on
the
dry
side
then
you
may
really
enjoy
merry
monks
personally
the
residual
sweetness
seen
in
this
style
of
ale
is
what
draws
me
to
belgian
styles
and
merry
monks
doesnt
have
what
i
am
looking
for
you
may
enjoy
it
more
than
i
so
dont
let
this
review
prevent
you
from
getting
some
just
not
my
thing
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
kind
of
musky
with
a
phenol
medicine
taste
and
also
a
banana
and
plum
taste
the
finish
is
complex
with
the
lingering
effect
of
both
the
phenol
and
fruit
taste
theres
a
chalky
like
yeasty
flavor
throughout
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
tart
apple
and
tobacco
with
an
herbal
edge
towards
the
ends
the
tobacco
is
felt
on
the
tongue
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
not
to
thin
and
almost
a
bit
close
to
cloying
as
these
flavors
are
abundant
but
somewhat
scattered
overall
though
a
good
triple
and
one
of
the
more
authentic
ones
ive
had
from
an
american
brewer
d
pretty
good
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
not
overwhelming
pours
an
ever
so
slightly
hazed
yellow
straw
color
with
a
tint
of
orange
belgian
candied
sugar
and
light
toasted
grains
with
a
faint
citrus
smell
this
might
be
a
little
off
i
just
brushed
my
teeth
sweet
malts
and
candied
sugars
on
the
palate
not
overly
sweet
like
some
tripels
semi
dry
finish
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
decent
american
tripel
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
not
the
easiest
to
drink
given
the
sweetness
and
booze
taste
levels
still
pretty
enjoyable
though
overall
i
believe
this
one
is
definitely
more
rounded
than
my
current
favorite
golden
monkey
since
it
has
more
flavors
of
tart
fruits
and
a
sort
of
bubblegum
yeast
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
since
someone
recommended
it
to
me
pick
it
up
if
you
love
the
style
it
is
definitely
not
the
most
complicated
triple
available
in
the
usa
but
it
is
highly
reliable
as
a
tasty
and
drinkable
belgian
style
ale
d
my
2nd
go
around
with
this
beer
was
better
than
the
1st
but
its
still
kind
of
big
for
the
style
thats
advertised
on
the
bottle
both
in
feel
and
alcohol
content
which
is
well
masked
but
felt
i
will
go
for
this
again
possibly
in
those
new
caged
and
corked
750s
maybe
there
is
a
difference
there
d
no
more
for
me
i
am
as
hitormiss
on
weyerbachers
stuff
as
any
brewery
including
dfh
this
is
a
miss
due
to
its
unbalanced
and
crass
nature
delicately
frothy
microfoam
gets
close
to
three
fingers
upon
the
pour
but
dissipates
swiftly
even
surface
without
much
dimpling
similarly
no
real
lacing
left
behind
superhazy
yelloworange
color
fully
opaque
lightens
a
touch

the
outermost

peaches
banana
compote
golden

cinnamon

yeast
orange
juice
clove
might
be
the
hardest
edged
element
there
a
one
trick
pony
fullbodied
with
a
fluffy
feel
like
a

full
of
cotton
candy
which
is
not
far
from
how
it
tastes
too
banana
strawberry
peach
apricot
pear
red
cherry
pineapple
a
veritable
fruit
cocktail
sloshing
about
luckily
there
is
a
bitter
kick
at
the
end
almost
shocks
you
awake
orange
lemon
citrus
alternates
between
sweet
and
sour
coriander
clove
nutmeg
spice
but
without
much
directed
role
pulls
some
of
its
shit
together
by
the
end
but
this
is
probably
as
random
as
everything
else
good
if
you
have
a
serious
sweet
tooth
ddue
to
the
heavy
body
and
bigger
alcohol
presence
this
is
not
as
drinkable
as
other
examples
though
its
still
very
drinkable
which
to
me
is
a
trademark
of
the
style
and
very
tasty
overall
an
average
take
on
a
style
i
dont
particularly
embrace
cheers
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
the
slightest
touch
of
orange
big
bubbles
in
the
fluffy
white
head
quickly
disperse
leaving
about
an
eighth
inch
of
tightly
packed
foam
definitely
has
a
medicinal
note
in
the
aroma
off
the
bat
smell
then
goes
to
banana
apple
raisins
and
hints
of
alcohol
tastes
super
herbal
tart
apple
banana
and
an
underlying
citrus
note
alcohol
has
a
nice
warming
feeling
as
it
goes
down
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
brew
the
only
problem
is
that
its
hard
to
sense
the
9
3
and
with
the
flavor
i
could
accidentally
have
too
many
of
these
at
one
sitting
maintains
many
of
the
same
notes
the
spiciness
has
blended
much
more
completely
and
seems
better
balanced
yeasty
notes
have
faded
but
a
banana
flavor
has
developed
carbonation
is
more
tolerable
and
works
better
as
the
flavors
have
balanced
out
not
a
huge
difference
and
as
always
there
are
many
variables
but
i
like
this
one
better
after
a
little
time
in
the
cellar
wow
i
like
it
very
delightful
higher
alcohol
brew
i
must
remember
this
one
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
bi9g
effervescent
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
sweet
the
taste
follows
much
less
spicy
than
some
tripels
it
is
well
carbonated
and
medium
in
body
i
liked
this
beer
but
imo
its
flavors
are
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
gold
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
you
really
have
to
sniff
hard
to
get
anything
on
the
nose
taste
is
bannanafruitiness
and
booze
a
nice
beer
that
gives
a
warm
kick
on
the
back
end
this
is
not
your
beer
pong
brewi
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
carefully
decanted
into
my
duvel
tulip
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
just
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
that
hug
the
glass
the
appearance
comes
back
with
a
healthy
amount
of
spotty
lacing
during
consumption
this
just
smells
like
a
tripel
should
fruity
and
sweet
with
sugar
some
vinous
qualities
as
well
the
flavor
is
likewise
that
of
some
of
the
finest
from
belgium
fruity
and
vinous
with
a
little
sweetness
to
counter
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
finishes
clean
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
has
abundant
but
not
harsh
carbonation
that
goes
well
with
the
flavors
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
quality
of
the
flavor
but
look
at
that
abv
that
will
limit
consumption
this
one
falls
about
mid
way
to
slightly
towards
the
top
in
the
ranks
of
tripels
ive
had
sadly
it
seems
to
be
getting
less
drinkable
as
i
get
through
it
though
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
it
certainly
wont
keep
me
from
trying
other
weyerbacher
brews
but
its
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
golden
ale
perhaps
the
lack
of
complexity
ultimately
makes
this
easier
drinking
than
your
average
9
3
beer
but
but
for
a
belgian
style
this
one
is
lacking
in
subtlety
and
nuance
quite
drinkable
alcohol
is
wellhidden
only
revealing
itself
in
a
gentle
warming
merry
monks
is
a
solid
american
stab
at
a
belgian
tripel
nothing
ground
breaking
but
with
a
good
price
tag
this
beer
satisfies
and
does
not
break
the
bank
drinkability
i
actually
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
almost
more
like
a
bspa
to
me
but
whatever
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
but
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
d
a
rather
fruity
perky
tripel
from
weyerbacher
interestingly
tart
but
this
has
a
full
flavor
profile
and
is
a
rather
nice
interpretation
of
a
popular
belgian
style
bottle
into
a
trappist
glass
poured
a
dark
amber
light
orange
color
with
no
head
aroma
had
a
hint
of
fruit
sweetness
and
citrus
also
a
very
heavy
yeast
smell
that
reminded
me
of
thanksgiving
stuffing
taste
was
a
little
sweet
which
does
not
really
fit
the
style
a
good
beer
but
more
reminiscent
of
a
very
strong
weizen
warning
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
here
that
9
3
will
catch
up
to
you
bright
yellow
with
a
finger
of
white
head
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
overwhelmingly
acidic
lemon
and
maybe
a
little
pineapple
and
blood
orange
the
flavor
was
undeniably
onedimensional
with
lemon
zest
piercing
through
from
start
to
finish
and
only
the
most
minute
trace
of
orange
peel
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
than
expected
but
at
least
spritzy
im
sorry
but
this
is
not
a
stellar
example
of
a
tripel
d
smooth
drink
but
not
for
me
a
fan
of
tripel
may
find
it
phenomenal
i
believe
but
again
not
for
me
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
bright
orange
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
into
a
small
cap
of
firm
lacing
that
last
a
while
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
moderate
funk
floral
notes
in
the
background
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
it
is
very
pleasing
the
taste
is
funkier
than
the
aroma
the
alcohol
is
more
prominent
the
citrus
and
floral
notes
are
still
there
but
they
are
toned
down
some
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
appropriately
high
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
it
might
not
stand
up
to
some
of
the
classic
belgian
examples
but
it
is
totally
drinkable
nonetheless
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
spicy
yet
creamy
rich
and
astringent
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
almost
full
this
beer
carries
a
lot
of
flavor
and
is
rather
good
the
head
was
a
real
disappointment
the
taste
was
more
pronounced
than
the
nose
i
was
hoping
for
some
balance
in
the
beers
flavor
it
is
jumbled
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
nice
sized
head
that
doeas
dissipate
to
a
nice
amber
ring
the
smell
is
bananas
clove
coriander
apples
and
pears
the
taste
is
pure
belgium
it
starts
with
a
banana
and
clove
hit
then
some
nice
yeast
taste
followed
bt
a
sweet
malt
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
weyerbacher
it
drinks
like
a
belgium
pale
ale
its
quite
tasty
the
9
3
abv
is
well
hidden
but
i
like
the
breweries
ipas
better
this
one
is
however
is
solid
and
a
great
one
to
try
if
you
like
the
style
i
did
and
its
recommended
pours
a
light
colored
amberorange
with
big
frothy
2
fingers
of
slightly
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fade
to
just
a
thin
film
across
the
top
of
the
beer
nose
is
full
of
sweet
smelling
cloves
yeast
and
bits
of
citrus
this
is
one
cloudy
bastard
perhaps
i
was
a
little
too
rough
on
the
pour
because
the
particles
making
it
appear
cloudy
are
individually
identifiable
and
some
of
them
are
rather
dark
and
large
floating
around
in
suspension
carb
level
is
quite
high
mouthfeel
pleasantly
medium
and
slightly
syrupy
in
the
finish
as
well
as
warming
taste
up
front
is
full
of
cloves
and
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
that
finishes
with
a
lingering
blend
of
both
yeast
and
cloves
d
good
but
not
amazing
a
little
harsh
on
the
alcohol
but
still
drinkable
not
bad
not
great
though
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
d
one
of
my
true
favorites
if
you
can
get
it
dont
hesitate
just
dive
in
drinkability
good
good
good
tasty
and
warm
id
have
this
one
again
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
not
really
to
style
though
since
it
seems
a
little
more
like
a
strong
german
hefeweizen
than
a
trippel
aromas
of
belgian
yeast
esters
faint
grassiness
flavor
encompasses
these
qualities
in
addition
to
dried
pears
some
orange
juice
in
the
aftertaste
no
belgian
spice
pepper
moderate
alcohol
flavor
no
creaminess
detected
this
is
a
bit
less
complex
than
most
belgian
tripels
ive
had
but
its
incredibly
drinkable
you
dont
get
caught
up
on
the
flavors
but
rather
the
enjoyment
it
brings
overall
very
strong
and
happy
beer
nearly
10
abv
will
put
you
to
bed
fast
pretty
delicious
packs
a
punch
a
good
beer
but
one
or
two
will
be
all
you
need
d
time
does
this
beer
wonders
i
had
this
on
tap
from
a
2
year
old
keg
and
it
was
liver
killing
this
is
a
nice
example
of
an
american
tripel
fresh
not
so
great
with
a
year
on
itwin
drinkability
worth
a
shot
while
not
among
the
top
tier
of
tripels
for
me
its
no
slouch
either
and
one
of
the
better
americanborn
tripels
out
there
mdvery
easy
to
drink
wouldnt
guess
a
9
3abv
by
taste
probably
would
have
guessed
5
or
6
hint
of
banana
does
taste
slightly
like
a
pale
ale
to
me
but
fantastic
all
around
i
love
this
one
and
the
price
at
my
distributor
is
only
37
99
a
case
i
did
like
it
i
will
get
it
again
if
i
find
it
in
my
travels
drinkability
pretty
good
good
attempt
and
pretty
tasty
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
great
session
beer
but
its
certainly
worthy
and
ill
probably
have
it
again
sometime
m
creamy
and
easy
drinking
descent
carbonation
really
a
good
local
tripel
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
not
the
best
triple
but
very
good
not
overly
sweet
very
drinkable
nice
yeast
and
banana
flavors
very
balanced
brew
stellar
out
of
a
caged
and
corked
bottle
this
beer
was
a
murky
rustygold
color
with
a
fistful
of
sediment
and
tons
of
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
yellowishbeige
threefingers
in
size
retained
excellently
as
a
fluffy
cap
and
turned
rocky
after
a
while
the
lacing
was
also
impressive
in
sliding
sheets
the
aroma
was
of
citrusy
hops
belgian
yeast
crystal
malt
lightly
spice
and
a
touch
of
nuts
the
flavors
were
complex
and
onpoint
for
a
belgian
style
abbey
ale
i
tasted
belgian
yeast
toffee
light
caramel
floral
hops
spicy
hops
and
citrusy
hops
alcohol
sweetbreads
a
touch
of
dough
and
coriander
semisweet
and
a
little
tangy
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
frothy
and
slightly
slick
the
body
was
full
and
the
carbonation
lively
this
was
a
very
complex
and
accurate
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
seen
made
on
this
side
of
the
pond
yum
i
initially
did
not
like
this
one
but
it
does
grow
on
you
better
than
i
first
thought
eric
taste
the
strongest
flavor
is
full
and
savory
starts
with
a
bite
of
carbonation
next
comes
a
champagne
like
sweetness
with
a
similar
style
carbonation
ends
with
an
alcohol
and
slight
hop
bitterness
as
it
warms
a
nice
sourness
makes
itself
known
a
crisp
unsweet
tripel
cheers
pours
a
pale
yellow
two
finger
head
that
reduces
to
a
ring
and
some
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
and
smells
of
belgian
yeast
like
youd
expect
taste
is
very
coyingly
sweet
you
can
get
too
sweet
a
taste
in
the
mouth
and
a
lingerin
sort
of
unpleasant
bitterness
in
the
back
sides
of
the
tongue
this
lingers
for
a
long
time
as
it
warms
it
gets
even
sweeter
im
not
a
fan
of
their
beers
just
dont
seem
to
be
to
my
taste
they
do
seem
to
be
crafted
well
just
not
to
my
liking
drinkability
is
ok
nothing
spectacular
again
a
little
to
heavy
and
a
little
to
spicey
for
a
good
session
d
unimpressed
to
say
the
least
a
fairly
average
beer
too
much
sweetness
and
ultimately
one
dimensional
not
enough
balance
between
fruit
and
dryness
in
the
form
of
carbonation
or
phenolic
qualities
and
the
sweetness
goes
unchecked
a
tripel
to
pass
by
not
a
bad
beer
very
crisp
mouth
on
this
time
has
not
mellowed
out
the
carbonation
of
which
i
am
surprised
carbonation
level
is
mediumhigh
flavor
is
full
of
pear
pineapple
grapes
and
finishes
with
a
sort
of
drying
breadlike
taste
wow
this
really
aged
well
im
sure
this
is
a
tamed
down
version
but
i
havent
a
recent
release
to
compare
it
to
i
really
liked
this
age
pretty
easy
to
consume
because
the
alcohol
burn
has
worn
off
though
its
presence
is
known
very
good
recommend
d
im
a
fan
i
generally
like
tripels
and
this
is
no
exception
i
didnt
notice
the
abv
with
merry
monks
as
much
as
with
golden
monkey
but
the
flavors
werent
quite
as
pleasing
to
me
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
get
again
pretty
much
explodes
out
of
the
bottle
with
massive
overflowing
foam
liquid
isnt
so
much
cloudy
as
chunky
i
guess
the
settled
sediment
was
stirred
up
quite
a
bit
nose
is
pungent
belgian
yeastiness
with
lots
of
tropical
fruit
and
sour
aromas
some
sharp
funk
and
grassiness
round
out
the
nose
the
flavour
is
much
more
mellow
with
strong
banana
and
some
orange
lemon
and
yeast
a
little
bit
spicy
and
herbal
coriander
and
cloves
light
body
and
finely
carbonated
pretty
drinkable
for
those
of
us
that
enjoy
a
good
tripel
this
is
a
merrymaker
indeed
for
others
this
large
bodied
beer
as
with
other
of
its
style
would
probably
only
pass
as
moderately
drinkable
drinkability
moderately
high
for
a
belgian
i
could
probably
attempt
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
the
abv
is
pretty
significant
as
it
clocks
in
at
9
3
the
flavor
is
great
and
it
doesnt
feel
very
heavy
in
the
stomach
but
it
definitely
packs
a
punch
notes
this
one
is
definately
a
slow
drinker
but
its
very
tasty
cheers
not
a
bad
tripel
not
outstanding
but
decent
i
would
buy
again
murky
orange
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
that
forms
quickly
but
diminishes
quickly
as
well
smells
of
yummy
belgian
yeast
and
fruit
taste
is
very
good
yeast
spices
and
banana
warm
alcohol
on
the
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
lightly
crisp
texture
and
lively
carbonation
it
was
an
enjoyable
and
respectable
americanmade
tripel
if
i
wasnt
so
pissed
i
might
give
it
a
better
review
prolly
couldnt
drink
this
all
night
simply
because
of
the
alcohol
but
still
a
very
delicious
beer
prolly
the
best
american
take
on
a
belgian
style
from
an
american
brewery
that
ive
had
so
far
i
know
there
definately
better
stuff
out
there
in
that
category
but
in
a
blind
tasting
i
dont
think
you
could
tell
the
difference
from
an
authentic
belgian
tripel
highly
recommend
this
one
d
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
could
be
dangerous
because
of
its
high
abv
i
couldnt
drink
too
much
of
this
beer
but
i
definitely
recommend
it
highly
drinkability
this
could
be
a
dangerous
one
very
easy
to
quaff
down
and
is
very
flavorful
i
got
loads
of
sugar
on
the
first
couple
sips
but
it
died
down
once
the
alchol
reared
its
head
as
it
warmed
i
liked
this
one
had
just
the
right
amount
of
elements
to
make
it
an
interesting
beer
well
done
still
none
too
shabby
i
will
revisit
because
it
is
pleasant
and
drinkable
d
this
is
a
beer
i
will
purchase
occasionally
not
on
the
regular
rotation
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
the
beer
has
the
smell
of
a
hint
of
bananas
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bananas
the
taste
reminds
me
more
of
a
hefeweizen
there
is
no
feel
of
carbonation
to
the
beer
the
drinkablity
is
very
high
for
a
beer
with
a
higher
acv
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
good
d
i
wasnt
head
over
heels
for
this
one
but
you
could
have
two
of
these
in
a
night
and
it
would
be
a
good
night
overall
a
fine
example
of
a
belgian
triple
not
overly
sweet
as
some
triples
are
the
750ml
bottle
is
head
and
shoulders
above
the
12oz
bottle
its
almost
a
different
beer
drinkability
moderate
seems
like
itd
pair
very
well
with
different
foods
but
on
its
own
id
say
one
is
enough
for
now
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
there
was
just
nothing
that
stood
out
to
me
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
necessarily
search
for
it
even
at
9
3
this
went
down
pretty
easy
flavors
are
balanced
so
it
is
fairly
drinkable
but
not
one
after
the
other
obviously
id
grab
this
one
again
if
i
was
looking
for
the
style
d
one
is
fine
but
this
is
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
of
the
style
tastes
of
lots
of
fruity
yeast
pale
malts
and
clove
peppery
spice
medium
body
good
carbonation
coats
the
mouth
nicely
dont
want
to
knock
this
ones
as
its
my
first
tripel
s
maybe
i
just
dont
like
the
style
fruity
smell
taste
was
a
bit
sour
and
bitter
yet
sweeter
finish
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
not
a
fan
of
how
bitter
it
was
surprisingly
smooth
for
a
9
3
abv
really
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
if
you
are
someone
who
likes
sweeter
beers
very
drinkable
especially
with
the
abv
so
well
hidden
notes
if
you
happen
to
buy
a
sixer
or
so
of
this
you
absolutely
must
age
at
least
half
them
absolutely
amazing
with
a
few
months
under
their
belt
d
everything
works
well
for
a
very
good
triple
one
of
my
favorites
overall
fairly
drinkable
nice
fruity
esters
good
alcohol
profile
but
it
pops
through
more
than
i
would
like
and
almost
dominates
at
times
overall
a
real
good
belgian
ale
on
the
sweeter
side
alcohol
is
not
burning
overall
a
good
brew
some
intense
flavor
offerings
to
be
experienced
and
worth
a
future
visit
pours
a
very
hazy
and
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
lacing
is
generous
lots
of
sediment
from
yeast
nose
is
pear
and
a
bit
bready
some
apple
in
the
smell
too
taste
is
fruity
in
up
front
kind
of
muted
and
blended
together
a
bit
but
then
decidedely
apple
and
citrusy
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
is
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
in
the
end
but
pretty
well
hidden
not
bad
overall
but
kind
of
wish
it
was
a
bit
drier
in
the
end
some
strange
aftertastes
as
well
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
just
a
bit
too
strong
and
upfront
for
my
taste
the
quad
of
one
of
the
ommegang
beers
would
be
higher
up
on
my
choice
for
belgian
brews
that
orginiate
from
my
neck
of
the
woods
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
mildly
complex
tripel
with
no
spice
and
lots
of
warming
potential
than
this
your
beer
drinkability
not
the
best
tripel
ive
ever
had
but
not
a
bad
one
by
any
means
the
taste
could
use
a
little
refinement
but
its
a
solid
beer
there
are
other
tripels
i
would
rather
have
for
my
money
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
notes
this
is
a
sweet
sour
floral
belgian
style
beer

0
d
not
bad
at
all
i
would
go
to
this
anytime
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
tripel
d
i
could
sit
down
and
easily
drink
2
or
3
of
these
after
the
first
sip
this
brew
just
keeps
asking
for
another
taste
d
drinks
just
fine
probably
a
little
easier
once
the
carbonation
weakens
a
bit
i
could
see
throwing
these
back
on
a
chilly
evening
ive
had
belgians
that
hide
their
810
a
little
better
but
this
beer
does
an
above
average
job
notes
i
had
planned
to
have
this
on
tap
in
rochester
ny
but
when
i
got
to
the
place
that
had
it
the
old
toad
i
forgot
the
name
of
it
and
only
recalled
it
after
a
few
beers
and
a
hearty
dinner
i
simply
could
not
have
another
that
night
what
a
great
beer
my
highest
compliments
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
light
to
medium
golden
in
color
i
did
not
know
that
this
beer
was
classified
as
a
tripel
until
afterwards
when
i
went
to
weyerbachers
website
smell
and
tatse
were
much
more
like
a
belgian
strong
ale
alcohol
and
white
fruits
were
evident
in
the
aroma
at
its
coldest
temperature
the
mouthfeel
was
very
fizzy
and
the
belgian
funk
was
evident
along
with
some
sweetness
as
the
beer
warmed
banana
and
pear
became
more
evident
as
did
the
alcohol
very
warming
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
yet
another
phenomenal
big
beer
from
weyerbacher
this
beer
aint
no
coors
lite
haha
the
feel
is
fizzy
like
champagne
and
also
syrupy
a
bubbly
bite
on
the
way
down
fizzy
citrusy
sweet
and
strong
a
decent
offering
overallmeh
an
ok
tripel
nothing
too
outlandish
or
special
would
like
to
see
it
aged
this
ones
not
the
best
tripel
in
existence
but
its
still
quite
tasty
the
taste
is
quite
drying
lots
of
clove
orange
zest
some
rind
flavors
definite
efforvescence
on
the
tongue
from
the
yeastiness
there
is
a
slight
medicinal
sweetness
to
the
beer
clove
lemon
citrus
and
a
full
palate
of
sweet
malts
this
is
a
sipping
beer
because
of
its
strength
but
the
9
3
abv
is
quite
well
hidden
and
there
is
no
throaty
burn
or
unpleasantly
alcoholic
aftertaste
the
beer
is
not
particularly
syrupy
although
it
is
quite
medium
to
full
bodied
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sting
on
the
tongue
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
tingly
from
the
yeastiness
and
efforvesence
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
a
wonderful
style
of
beer
lchaim
dnice
stab
at
the
style
i
like
this
and
would
definitely
buy
it
again
not
elite
but
not
real
far
off
this
brew
could
be
fairly
drinkable
its
crisp
refreshing
and
flavorful
but
at
over
9
i
wouldnt
recommend
having
more
than
a
couple
d
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
its
slightly
sweet
with
a
few
interesting
undertones
that
make
it
fun
to
drink
it
dosent
fatigue
your
taste
buds
or
fill
you
up
to
much
with
the
high
alcohol
and
sweetness
i
can
only
drink
2
or
3
at
a
sitting
cheers
d
this
is
a
good
imitation
of
a
belgian
tripel
not
quite
as
refined
as
those
beers
but
tasty
nonetheless
my
first
tripel
since
i
found
the
need
to
review
one
very
high
carbonation
with
low
head
retention
heavy
phenolics
from
the
get
go
but
a
smooth
inhale
with
a
pronounced
banana
fragrance
found
quite
a
lot
of
pearapple
in
the
first
sip
and
a
bit
onedimensional
as
the
temp
increased
an
enjoyable
drink
but
a
bit
much
for
a
session
this
is
a
good
beer
and
as
it
was
purchased
directly
from
the
brewer
very
fresh
merry
monks
is
a
rather
hearty
tripel
nicely
crafted
but
lacks
some
strength
in
a
couple
areas
of
what
makes
a
great
tripel
aroma
is
very
malty
with
some
nice
fruity
tones
along
with
a
small
amount
of
spice
nice
pour
good
rich
dark
golden
color
decent
white
head
and
strong
steady
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
very
malty
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
still
relatively
smooth
and
easy
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
flavor
but
to
be
fair
it
lacked
that
peppery
spiciness
and
needed
a
stronger
fruit
component
to
rank
it
any
higher
nice
yeastiness
and
as
previously
stated
the
malt
content
cant
be
questioned
mmmm
not
bad
at
all
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
long
sitting
but
am
not
sure
i
would
choose
to
overall
a
good
golden
ale
technically
its
a
tripel
with
plenty
of
spice
and
bananamalt
character
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
to
for
a
decent
white
head
that
thins
but
laces
smells
very
sweet
cant
pick
out
anything
specific
taste
sweet
alochol
and
sweet
spices
mouthfeel
was
awesome
except
for
the
initial
alcohol
bite
but
it
was
so
smooth
from
there
on
out
drinkability
it
awesome
it
goes
down
easy
i
could
of
had
1
more
bottle
poured
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
sediment
and
a
thin
white
head
that
fell
quickly
aroma
has
sweet
malt
light
spice
snappy
yeast
faint
fruit
and
light
alcohol
mouth
feel
is
medium
light
with
medium
carbonation
flavor
has
lots
of
sweetened
malt
caramel
spiced
yeast
hefty
ester
fruit
and
a
back
end
alcohol
the
beer
pours
a
murky
looking
golden
orange
color
the
aroma
is
both
fruity
and
yeasty
taste
is
fruity
yet
also
has
some
sour
notes
associated
with
some
belgian
style
brews
heavy
bready
character
medium
to
heavy
body
feels
a
bit
syrupy
in
the
mouth
belgians
are
not
my
specialty
but
i
have
had
some
great
belgian
beers
and
this
in
not
one
of
them
not
bad
though
oddly
the
first
few
bottles
from
the
six
pack
where
much
more
drinkable
when
i
cracked
them
open
the
other
night
and
enjoyed
them
without
thinking
about
the
flavors
too
much
some
beers
get
better
when
you
examine
them
carefully
others
dont
unfortunately
this
beer
is
one
of
the
latter
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
real
scrutiny
d
ok
went
down
fairly
easily
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
d
it
is
a
bit
thick
and
heavy
for
a
tripel
but
the
complexity
and
balance
makes
it
a
drink
to
admire
it
would
make
a
difficult
session
beer
but
a
fantastic
sipper
worth
having
in
the
stash
btw
there
are
some
great
banana
burps
with
this
one
this
is
a
beer
for
the
belgian
fans
who
like
the
prominent
candy
sugar
taste
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
merry
monks
is
pretty
solid
the
higher
abv
limits
the
drinkibility
a
bit
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
try
this
i
would
say
it
is
worth
it
drinkability
pretty
good
this
is
a
solid
tripel
my
first
of
hopefully
many
weyerbacher
beers
this
has
a
great
golden
color
but
the
head
is
lacking
a
bit
the
nose
has
fruity
malts
sweet
alcohols
and
some
spicy
belgian
yeasts
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
but
still
good
maybe
just
a
pich
more
hops
medium
to
full
body
is
well
carbonated
a
good
attempt
at
the
style
but
it
would
be
really
good
if
they
turned
it
into
a
belgian
double
ipa
poured
into
my
corsendonk
christmas
ale
glass
a
nice
dark
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
white
head
basically
no
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
nice
floral
notes
with
some
spice
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
yeasty
good
floral
notes
slight
bananna
notes
and
some
spice
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
another
tasty
weyerbacher
brew
i
would
recommend
this
beer
its
a
strong
beer
and
overall
it
is
enjoyable
but
for
the
tripel
category
i
think
there
are
others
that
a
preferable
overall
this
is
a
great
tripel
seek
it
out
its
one
of
the
best
either
in
the
u
s
or
in
belgium
solid
tripel
very
good
ill
be
happy
to
consume
its
brothers
nicely
done
overall
however
it
feels
like
i
may
have
opened
one
too
soon
ill
let
some
age
and
review
it
again
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
american
example
of
the
style
i
would
try
more
and
cellar
some
prosit
mk
drinkabilityat
9
this
is
a
little
hot
and
can
sneak
up
on
you
but
it
sure
goes
down
nicely
i
poured
this
belgian
style
tripel
into
a
chimay
chalise
this
beer
put
the
golden
into
golden
ale
it
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
12
an
inch
head
of
fizzy
white
foam
this
fizzy
head
of
foam
had
good
retention
that
left
behind
a
small
white
film
and
spots
of
white
lace
the
aroma
was
lightly
citrusy
and
yeasty
with
citrus
hops
red
grapes
burnt
malts
and
a
hint
of
yeast
there
wasnt
much
going
on
in
the
aroma
or
the
taste
the
taste
was
lightly
citrusy
with
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
more
burnt
malts
alcohol
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
subtle
grapefruit
and
a
pinch
of
yeast
at
the
end
belgian
taste
not
really
it
was
just
a
beer
with
little
flavor
this
was
light
bodied
beer
with
a
faint
aftertaste
of
citrus
hops
alcohol
citrus
fruits
and
a
hint
of
yeast
not
much
going
on
there
either
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
beer
is
it
a
belgain
style
if
it
is
then
its
on
the
lower
end
of
the
belgian
styles
i
sure
hope
not
all
of
these
are
like
this
and
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
if
its
suppose
to
be
like
this
then
i
wont
be
touching
this
beer
again
drinks
pretty
good
the
booze
complexity
do
slow
you
down
a
damn
good
tripel
regardless
of
where
it
comes
from
body
is
medium
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
for
its
strength
mouthfeel
doesnt
feel
belgian
but
still
a
very
nice
brew
somehow
this
ended
up
in
my
cooler
when
i
got
home
from
a
mountain
bike
festival
i
aint
complaining
i
poured
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
foamed
to
a
2
thick
head
probably
due
to
my
swirling
the
bottle
34
of
the
way
through
the
pour
still
left
some
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
poured
a
light
hazy
gold
and
the
sediment
hung
in
the
glass
without
settling
to
the
bottom
smelled
of
citrus
spice
and
hops
but
not
overly
strong
had
a
nice
body
in
the
mouth
and
went
down
real
smooth
the
fruit
spice
and
hops
were
well
balanced
and
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
lingered
after
the
swallow
i
finished
the
glass
while
making
fajitas
and
the
glass
went
down
real
easy
bummer
that
this
was
my
only
bottle
i
enjoyed
this
one
fyi
im
not
one
to
brag
but
i
make
a
mean
fajita
d
a
good
strong
sipping
beer
a
treat
indeed
not
the
best
of
trippels
but
far
from
the
worst
alcohal
is
present
not
so
much
at
first
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
it
was
brewed
year
round
it
is
about
as
good
as
any
belgian
import
youll
find
here
better
than
some
in
fredericksburg
total
wine
carries
it
having
grown
up
in
eastons
i
am
extremley
happy
wtih
weyerbachers
effort
and
quality
for
this
beer
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
it
has
an
aroma
that
is
true
to
its
flavor
and
masks
its
high
alcohol
content
well
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
a
beer
for
anyone
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
and
complexity
of
flavors
this
beer
has
a
high
amount
of
citrus
zings
and
malty
notes
and
is
very
sweet
considering
the
potency
of
the
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
to
any
beer
lover
or
anyone
who
wants
a
beer
that
has
a
citrus
flavoring
and
wants
a
little
more
buzz
from
their
drink
d
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
for
a
beer
with
9
30
abv
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
it
might
not
be
the
best
tripel
out
there
but
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
merry
monks
ale
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
nice
fruit
sugar
bubblegum
all
come
to
mind
the
taste
has
similar
notes
as
well
as
a
bit
of
clove
one
of
the
best
american
versions
of
a
belgian
beer
that
ive
tried
poured
the
bottle
into
my
goblet
glass
and
received
a
orangish
hue
with
light
head
that
left
a
lace
ring
around
the
glass
some
hops
and
sweetness
come
through
in
the
smell
and
also
something
like
flowers
or
like
fabreeze
it
just
had
one
of
those
fresh
smells
as
they
say
havent
smelt
that
in
a
long
time
in
a
beer
light
to
mediumbodied
this
beer
has
a
some
sharpness
as
it
hits
the
tongue
but
rides
out
smooth
while
no
hop
kick
is
really
present
as
it
shouldnt
there
is
a
wonderful
fruit
burst
the
fruit
i
tasted
most
for
some
reason
was
cherries
but
there
were
tropical
fruits
suchs
as
pineapple
in
there
as
well
for
a
belgian
style
triple
i
thought
the
spicing
was
a
little
lowkey
but
the
beer
still
finished
with
a
strong
backbite
that
warmed
me
up
this
is
a
pretty
decent
american
representation
of
a
tripel
poured
up
a
nice
cloudy
pale
yellow
colour
looked
like
100s
of
other
tripels
smell
was
spicy
with
a
fairly
noticeable
musty
funk
that
i
would
expect
more
from
a
saison
nice
taste
was
well
balance
with
a
sweet
spicy
flavour
up
front
and
a
nice
bitter
hop
profile
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
about
where
it
should
be
for
this
style
with
quite
alot
of
co2
a
nice
u
s
tripel
drinkability
i
like
this
a
lot
actually
which
i
didnt
expect
to
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
though
it
is
dangerously
high
approaching
double
digits
a
pleasant
surprise
that
shows
what
an
effect
expectations
can
have
on
the
enjoyability
of
a
beer
in
my
opinion
i
ordered
a
second
before
the
meal
was
over
and
would
have
definitely
been
satisfied
with
a
third
or
fourth
if
we
had
stayed
longer
d
very
drinkable
a
good
american
version
of
the
style
not
very
carbonated
and
it
would
have
helped
to
lighten
up
the
beer
as
is
its
a
bit
sticky
and
leaves
a
slightly
dry
coating
in
the
mouth
still
very
drinkable
but
im
afraid
putting
this
belgianstyle
golden
ale
into
a
duvel
glass
might
have
been
way
too
high
a
pedestal
for
its
own
good
and
might
have
subconsciously
overamped
my
expectations
too
even
so
allinall
the
drink
aint
bad
and
i
might
even
like
it
at
9
3
abv
not
for
sessions
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
its
pretty
highly
carbonated
it
finishes
with
an
orange
tartness
mixed
with
candy
sugar
im
certainly
liking
this
tripel
and
i
think
once
again
that
weyerbacher
does
some
interesting
and
very
flavourable
beers
in
every
style
they
try
so
far
at
least
i
recommend
it
m
grainy
and
smooth
and
pungent
all
together
pretty
good
many
better
out
there
but
they
do
a
damn
fine
job
of
it
down
in
pa
coked
750ml
bottle
whose
cork
hits
the
ceiling
as
soon
as
i
remove
the
cage
followed
by
a
rush
of
bubbles
from
the
bottle
poured
into
a
tripel
karmeliet
glass
a
hazy
very
bubbly
pale
orange
with
a
thin
frothy
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
yeast
and
some
spice
slight
orange
presence
as
well
the
taste
is
a
sweet
blend
of
malts
and
fruits
with
a
slight
sourness
that
hits
in
the
very
end
the
beer
is
medium
for
the
alcohol
content
with
slight
carbonation
this
one
is
enjoyable
when
bottle
conditioned
certainly
better
than
the
sixpack
version
pretty
drinkable
although
the
flavor
going
bitter
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
still
i
would
gladly
try
this
again
perhaps
a
little
colder
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
strong
belgian
style
ale
quite
sweet
and
a
good
mouthfeel
i
only
complain
about
the
very
light
nose
and
the
appearance
wasnt
too
eye
catching
either
i
may
buy
again
though
bottle
from
ppoitras
in
no
bs
3
taste
of
some
cherry
maybe
spices
and
bannana
sweet
great
taste
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
one
even
improves
a
little
more
if
you
let
it
warm
just
a
litle
the
flavors
come
out
more
i
must
say
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
for
a
belgium
ale
mouthfeel
is
thick
sour
bitter
and
delicious
i
really
liked
this
tripel
mouthfeel
carries
and
airy
lightness
and
fine
carbonation
bubbles
that
are
to
style
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
presence
overall
not
my
favorite
from
a
local
brewery
i
could
see
some
age
possibly
improving
this
but
i
dont
have
the
experience
to
back
up
the
claim
im
not
sure
i
can
state
this
directly
enough
i
hate
this
beer
the
more
weyerbacher
beers
i
drink
the
more
i
think
that
double
simcoe
aside
there
is
something
about
this
brewery
that
just
doesnt
jive
with
my
palate
i
will
have
great
difficulty
finishing
this
6
pack
this
is
a
light
belgian
ale
so
it
poured
a
light
yellow
almost
clear
with
some
fluffy
white
head
it
almost
looked
like
mt
dew
it
smelled
of
wheat
and
citrus
hops
mostly
lemon
it
tasted
like
lemon
hops
and
some
yeast
with
a
very
light
aftertaste
the
texture
was
very
thin
and
carbonated
almost
like
champagne
there
was
practically
no
alcohol
flavor
and
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
it
was
a
good
light
beer
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
tried
it
because
im
a
huge
weyerbacher
fan
and
i
cant
get
it
anywhere
in
the
midwest
so
when
im
out
east
i
make
it
a
point
to
drink
their
stuff
appearance
has
never
been
all
that
important
to
me
which
is
good
because
its
the
color
of
wet
straw
with
little
head
aromas
of
yeast
and
sugar
leap
from
the
glass
it
has
a
long
malty
middle
with
a
sweet
belgiany
backtaste
like
a
sweet
version
of
duvel
on
the
finish
it
segues
from
sweet
to
dry
a
little
champagnelike
it
hides
the
alcohol
pretty
well
not
necessarily
a
plus
since
i
like
a
little
alcohol
presence
allowing
for
my
lack
of
predisposition
for
the
style
id
call
this
interesting
and
somewhat
distinctive
and
those
are
both
pluses
in
my
book
dont
drink
and
review
md
mouthfeel
is
moderate
mainly
due
to
the
sweetness
the
tastes
are
light
and
make
the
overall
impression
relatively
light
especially
given
the
rather
heavy
gravity
of
this
brew
the
carbonation
is
great
light
but
persistent
creating
that
great
creaminess
typical
of
good
belgian
ales
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
liked
it
prompting
me
to
bump
up
my
original
score
for
drinkability
try
it
if
you
like
triples
good
stuff
the
pour
on
this
beer
is
a
little
weak
out
of
the
bottle
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
to
see
if
it
differs
it
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
had
little
to
no
retention
the
aroma
was
of
cherries
spices
and
possibly
even
banana
with
the
first
sip
i
could
pick
up
on
cloves
citrus
and
honey
as
i
continued
i
picked
up
on
the
banana
and
nutmeg
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
taste
was
muted
but
the
combo
of
the
fruits
was
good
enough
to
make
it
easy
to
drink
i
would
love
to
taste
this
on
tap
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
alcohol
was
a
little
evident
but
was
fairly
covered
up
by
the
banana
esters
and
citrus
taste
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
and
complimented
the
taste
very
well
definitely
a
wellrounded
brew
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
carbonation
level
is
good
and
its
relatively
smooth
at
9
3
it
is
strong
and
drinkability
is
somewhat
limited
but
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
offering
definitely
worth
a
try
taste
is
sweet
with
heavy
candied
sugar
slight
hints
of
the
aforementioned
banana
decent
malt
backing
some
of
the
alcohol
tones
can
be
made
out
but
for
the
most
part
are
well
concealed
carbonation
is
assertive
and
crisp
d
i
have
to
give
this
one
credit
for
disguising
its
alcohol
by
volume
very
well
beneath
the
complex
flavors
though
the
style
is
meant
to
be
a
slow
sipper
this
one
is
easy
to
gulp
down
if
the
situation
calls
for
it
i
havent
had
a
huge
number
of
brews
in
this
category
but
i
felt
that
this
stuff
was
a
bit
too
malty
and
poorly
yeasted
i
wont
buy
more
d
wow
i
could
have
just
watched
that
head
for
hours
after
each
sip
it
gelled
back
together
and
i
think
i
could
have
written
my
name
in
it
the
beer
had
nice
sweetness
with
some
supporting
flavors
that
did
not
overpower
it
and
the
hops
were
a
good
support
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
very
thin
head
the
nose
is
mostly
fruitiness
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
and
spices
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
spiciness
and
follows
through
with
a
very
syrupy
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
slippery
with
some
nice
warming
from
the
alcohol
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
something
approaching
the
doubledigit
abvs
overall
a
big
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
overall
a
nice
drink
only
one
of
these
i
think
burp
unfortunately
i
didnt
get
much
out
of
this
beer
except
for
a
slightly
offputting
aftertaste
while
it
had
some
of
the
tripel
sweetness
going
on
the
yeasty
finish
was
unpleasant
in
this
example
and
the
complete
lack
of
head
just
sealed
the
deal
for
me
d
the
alcohol
presence
is
clear
but
this
is
one
pleasure
of
a
tripel
that
i
was
more
than
happy
to
bring
a
case
of
12ozs
home
with
me
d
good
sipper
and
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
warming
you
throughout
it
doesnt
hide
at
all
this
goes
down
much
more
smoothly
than
i
thought
it
would
after
looking
at
the
label
and
discovering
it
was
9
3
abv
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
that
from
drinking
the
beer
unfortunately
overtime
its
watery
taste
and
high
content
form
an
unsuitable
pair
making
me
dream
of
the
glory
of
victorys
golden
monkey
or
chimay
this
beer
makes
me
think
there
is
an
abbey
hidden
in
the
hills
of
easton
pa
weyerbacher
is
known
for
its
eccentric
strong
intense
beers
and
this
brew
certainly
fits
the
bill
from
a
12
oz
bottle
copped
singly
from
wine
and
more
pours
a
strawish
golden
color
with
slight
head
and
visible
carbonation
aroma
and
smell
are
similar
to
a
belgian
strong
ale
with
a
distinct
whitewine
characteristic
present
very
strong
taste
with
noticeable
alcohol
finish
go
easy
with
this
one
the
9
3
abv
hits
you
hard
take
it
slow
with
this
one
sweet
finish
that
lingers
on
the
palate
drinkable
being
generous
with
three
with
hefty
alcohol
percentagebanana
fruity
clove
finish
unique
nothing
is
really
wrong
with
this
brew
alcohol
does
raise
its
head
above
water
as
it
warms
it
just
is
not
up
to
par
with
some
of
the
other
tripels
ive
had
recently
if
it
was
available
i
would
certainly
have
a
few
in
the
cellar
and
would
pick
it
up
any
time
i
felt
like
a
taste
of
belgium
pours
a
clouded
amber
gold
with
minimal
head
nose
is
heavy
with
perfume
and
a
citrus
edge
and
also
a
gummy
tone
flavor
is
tangy
with
citrus
but
is
subdued
enough
that
it
isnt
overpowering
feel
is
gummy
and
bordering
on
syrupy
from
ingredients
very
drinkable
a
smooth
and
well
made
brew
anyone
in
the
u
s
who
can
brew
a
belgian
style
and
pull
it
off
is
definitely
worth
giving
respect
to
and
trying
two
of
two
for
the
day
have
that
jetfuel
taste
to
them
this
one
tastes
like
a
young
mead
really
sharp
on
the
alcohol
again
i
might
save
a
few
bottles
for
a
year
or
two
but
well
im
like
most
folks
i
go
to
the
store
to
buy
a
beer
to
drink
it
right
away
ah
well

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
although
it
is
definitely
on
a
lower
rung
than
the
world
class
tripels
out
there
a
very
nice
example
of
a
triple
thanks
leftmindedrighty
d
a
very
pleasant
beer
i
would
be
glad
to
get
more
of
these
not
sure
id
want
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
though

very
present
on

finish
along
with
some
citrus

too
m
coarse
kind
of
biting
but
it
sort
of
works
well
with
the
alcohol
kick
at
the
end
d
its
a
bit
onenote
on
the
palate
hard
to
figure
out
whats
going
on
underneath
the
sweeter
notes
but
definitely
a
nice
beer
i
wish
i
had
some
bleu
cheese
or
gorgonzola
to
go
with
it
i
think
that
would
definitely
enhance
the
experience
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
get
through
ill
be
honest
even
after
six
months
its
still
a
little
hot
and
the
alcohol
is
at
times
a
little
bit
offensive
there
is
a
lot
going
on
and
with
so
much
its
easy
to
see
why
its
an
83
point
beer
if
four
or
five
flavors
became
one
or
two
this
is
a
high
80s
beer
with
all
that
said
im
stoked
to
see
what
this
becomes
next
may
this
is
by
no
means
the
best
americanmade
triple
its
probably
only
the
third
best
triple
to
come
from
pennsylvania
but
there
are
not
many
triples
that
are
so
complex
and
while
it
is
not
the
best
from
either
america
or
pa
it
is
absolutely
the
most
unique
and
that
makes
it
worthy
of
trying
a
nice
effort
from
the
folks
at
weyerbacher
poured
an
orangegold
color
into
a
tulip
glass
foamy
white
head
dissipated
quickly
into
nothingness
with
almost
no
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
scent
of
belgian
yeast
and
fermented
fruit
smell
seemed
a
little
off
more
flavors
of
yeast
and
definitely
a
hint
of
banana
at
the
finish
somewhat
lively
in
the
mouth
with
surprisingly
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
definitely
inspired
by
a
belgian
pale
but
didnt
quite
hit
the
mark
ive
had
better
from
weyerbacher
but
all
and
all
not
too
bad
this
seems
to
be
a
very
inconsistent
beer
mine
was
not
sour
as
some
other
reviewers
have
noticed
instead
it
was
an
alcohol
bomb
also
as
some
other
reviewers
have
noticed
d
probably
one
of
my
favorite
styles
id
be
honored
to
start
and
finish
a
night
with
this
this
isnt
my
favorite
belgian
style
beer
unibroue
makes
far
better
and
as
far
as
pa
brews
go
golden
monkey
is
still
the
standard
bearer
i
had
had
this
beer
before
but
it
was
a
long
time
and
i
remembered
liking
it
so
i
decided
to
pick
one
up
as
part
of
my
mixed
six
pack
from
abes
poured
into
a
tulip
golden
color
not
hazy
per
se
but
it
did
have
little
pieces
of
yeast
sediment
floating
throughout
that
were
kind
of
gross
like
smuttynose
ipa
head
didnt
last
long
and
left
only
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
was
alcohol
and
fruity
esters
with
a
little
hop
spice
taste
was
similar
with
some
sweetness
light
body
and
fair
drinkabilitymiddle
of
the
road
i
would
say
not
bad
but
far
from
great
edit
just
like
the
old
heathen
and
others
in
the
big
beer
case
this
one
has
gotten
better
over
time
as
well
at
least
for
me
it
has
a
nice
scent
with
good
malt
and
sweetness
qualities
and
a
great
belgian
ale
taste
could
be
my
tastes
are
expanding
or
it
could
be
ive
let
the
last
couple
of
cases
sit
longer
and
theyve
aged
better
either
way
im
good
after
hearing
all
kinds
of
things
about
this
beer
and
being
skeptical
i
have
to
say
ive
come
around
im
impressed
with
its
drinkability
and
would
definitely
like
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
winter
evening
with
friends
looks
and
smell
considered
when
i
finally
tasted
the
beer
i
was
a
bit
taken
aback
its
got
a
very
strongly
bitter
taste
overall
its
not
horrible
but
not
exactly
great
either
a
bit
bitter
for
my
liking
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
gritty
you
can
feel
the
substance
there
i
would
say
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
bring
over
to
a
friends
house
its
very
unique
and
interesting
looking
all
around
big
fan
of
this
easton
pa
beer
maybe
im
partial
though
since
i
was
born
there
definitely
needs
to
be
more
carbonated
i
wonder
how
they
carbonated
if
they
bottle
condition
or
if
they
inject
co2
if
they
condition
i
wonder
if
they
reyeasted
or
not
any
how
decent
brew
but
defeinalty
not
a
great
a
representation
of
a
belgian
tripel
not
a
terrible
beer
but
certainly
not
a
goto
tripel
thats
for
sure
many
better
ones
out
there
including
american
representations
of
the
style
drinkability
a
delicious
beer
would
likely
hold
up
well
in
the
cellar
for
the
more
patient
among
us
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
after
a
pretty
aggressive
pour
if
i
did
that
with
a
real
beligan
i
would
have
no
beer
left
the
smell
is
typical
tripel
belgian
candi
sugar
is
front
and
center
followed
by
some
banana
like
yeast
characteristics
the
taste
is
boozy
and
sweet
hits
pretty
hard
off
the
bat
typical
of
the
american
versions
of
the
tripel
the
candi
sugar
and
alcohol
heat
dominate
the
palate
this
brew
could
use
a
bigger
malt
presence
to
balance
the
feel
is
moderate
and
a
bit
syrupy
finishes
with
alcohol
heat
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
an
average
american
tripel
doesnt
taste
bad
just
doesnt
have
the
flavor
profile
or
balance
of
a
true
belgian
tripel
overall
a
nice
beer
for
the
style
and
price
but
its
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
have
liked
its
a
stab
at
the
style
and
though
it
has
certain
characteristics
of
a
belgian
tripel
its
not
the
real
deal
even
compared
to
other
american
interpretations
of
the
style
im
just
lukewarm
towards
this
one
drinkability
good
again
a
bit
too
sweet
even
for
me
true
belgians
rely
on
the
yeast
to
give
a
full
complexity
for
beers
of
this
style
i
think
i
found
that
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
its
too
sweet
and
too
alcoholic
almost
like
a
really
fruity
wine
the
alcohol
cuts
through
into
the
aftertaste
quite
a
bit
leaving
nothing
else
on
the
tongue
it
is
nicely
carbonated
and
golden
colored
and
smells
very
sweet
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
is
splendidly
drinkable
my
only
negative
from
this
experience
is
the
complete
and
utter
lack
of
a
head
or
lacing
seems
to
be
a
popular
theme
reading
thru
the
other
reviews
mouthfeel
great
very
good
beer
d
this
is
another
great
brew
from
weyerbacher
my
last
to
review
from
the
big
beers
sampleri
saved
this
bottle
for
reviewing
long
after
the
rest
were
gone
the
alcohol
is
noticable
in
this
oneso
one
is
enough
before
moving
on
to
a
session
ale
this
is
an
enjoyable
slowsipper
that
i
will
have
again
257
reviews
as
of
this
writing
i
would
generally
call
this
a
decent
tripel
not
top
of
the
class
definitely
above
the
mid
mark
though
i
liked
the
appearance
but
i
found
it
a
touch
too
simple
sweet
and
more
a
tartness
than
i
wouldve
otherwise
desired
in
a
tripel
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
it
is
fresh
crisp
and
enjoyable
and
like
most
of
the
big
ws
products
distinctive
as
far
as
american
tripels
go
this
one
it
topps
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
little
head
the
nose
is
pungent
and
has
notes
of
coriander
spice
banana
and
light
malts
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
like
most
tripels
a
little
off
putting
at
how
nonalcoholic
it
tastes
even
though
its
around
9
the
spices
are
most
apparent
with
the
banana
sneaking
in
toward
the
end
the
finish
is
terrific
the
syruplike
consistency
lingers
for
a
long
time
and
doesnt
seem
to
dissipate
until
another
sip
is
taken
i
really
hate
to
be
that
guy
with
very
few
reviews
under
his
belt
that
jumps
on
ba
to
review
the
terrible
but
i
just
dont
understand
the
positive
reviews
of
this
beer
i
have
to
jump
in
here
and
speak
my
piece
done
sided
beer
with
banana
dominating
there
are
a
lot
of
issues
here
i
did
not
realize
this
was
a
tripel
when
i
was
drinking
it
i
thought
it
was
a
singel
type
i
guess
the
only
thing
i
can
say
good
about
it
is
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
was
a
treat
for
me
today
as
i
picked
up
the
cold
single
and
drank
it
straight
away
this
afternoon
poured
a
strong
light
brownish
amber
with
a
big
two
inch
off
white
head
lots
of
foam
and
lace
left
over
from
this
one
lots
of
visible
carbonation
was
readily
apparent
smell
was
full
of
yeast
and
grain
a
touch
of
alcohol
was
also
present
picked
up
some
grassy
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
was
a
classic
tripel
lots
of
yeasty
flavors
plums
a
touch
of
peach
a
lot
of
bready
grains
mixed
in
as
well
a
touch
of
alcohol
was
definatly
there
and
made
its
presence
well
known
great
smooth
feel
due
to
lots
of
carbonation
this
was
actually
not
as
much
of
a
sipper
as
i
would
have
thought
i
was
easily
able
to
drink
this
while
walking
around
no
problem
not
saying
it
would
be
a
session
beer
but
not
a
snifter
eaither
overall
i
was
actually
fairly
impressed
with
this
had
a
great
feel
and
flavor
full
body
and
just
a
good
all
around
belgian
gotta
love
what
these
american
breweries
are
able
to
do
with
these
nowadays
damn
impressive
for
sure
i
would
efinatly
try
this
one
again
oh
its
tasty
but
have
more
than
one
and
youre
not
going
to
get
very
much
accomplished
d
that
abv
while
hidden
could
easily
do
you
in
nice
solid
tripel
nonetheless
overall
another
good
big
beer
from
weyerbacher
crisp
belgain
flavor
surprisgly
high
drinkability
considering
strength
d
very
high
this
is
especially
good
for
its
alcohol
content
which
i
expected
to
be
lower
its
nice
and
sweet
a
little
too
sweet
like
most
american
takes
on
belgian
styles
but
for
the
price
its
not
bad
the
flavor
starts
with
light
fruit
syrup
taste
followed
an
almost
hot
spice
flavor
with
some
pale
grains
mixed
in
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
great
belgians
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
merry
monks
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
head
aroma
is
chalky
yeast
and
a
sweet
graininess
flavor
is
sweet
pale
malts
with
plenty
of
fruity
esters
and
phenolic
taste
yeast
flavor
is
more
balanced
than
the
aroma
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
once
again
another
weyerbacher
beer
that
is
too
big
for
its
britches
everything
they
do
is
way
too
strong
good
carbonation
enjoyable
mouthfeel
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
i
wish
it
had
less
alcohol
i
could
drink
more
of
it
at
10
50
for
a
six
pack
this
could
easily
become
a
regular
one
of
the
unrateable
characteristics
is
value
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
money
a
damned
good
beer
cheers
bottle
courtesy
of
alkey
thanks
again
i
really
liked
this
beer
got
this
at
mckean
and
charles
in
waldoboro
todd
the
beer
guy
is
very
helpful
anyway
i
digress
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
snifter
and
was
a
golden
color
with
virtually
no
head
it
had
a
fruity
spicy
aroma
with
a
little
alcohol
coming
through
the
taste
was
similar
although
i
couldnt
detect
the
alcohol
that
i
thought
i
had
smelled
i
thought
this
to
be
a
good
example
of
a
tripel
and
would
happily
drink
more
of
them
pours
a
opaque
golden
color
three
finger
white
head
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
aromas
of
pear
apple
sugar
and
alcohol
taste
sugary
fruity
sweet
strong
alcohol
finish
mouthfeel
light
poor
carbonation
almost
flat
not
a
session
beer
good
for
maybe
one
or
two
maybe
some
aging
might
take
off
some
of
the
rough
edges
and
mellow
it
out
pours
perfectly
clear
and
golden
with
almost
no
head
just
a
bright
white
ring
around
the
sides
of
the
beer
without
much
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
slight
agitation
yields
pear
fruits
white
candi
sugar
and
earthy
subdued
hops
very
sweet
with
some
vanilla
flavor
to
start
off
with
along
with
a
green
apple
fruitiness
and
fresh
dough
flavor
hop
bitterness
is
not
nearly
developed
enough
to
balance
things
out
mouthfeel
is
poor
for
the
style
very
sticky
and
sweet
with
none
of
that
belgian
dryness
the
style
needs
i
cant
think
of
a
single
reason
to
choose
this
over
a
more
authentic
actually
belgian
tripel
its
way
too
sweet
and
thick
for
the
style
and
even
if
you
wanna
throw
style
out
the
window
its
just
cloying
and
untasty
note
i
do
not
generally
comment
on
the
freshness
dating
or
lack
thereof
on
the
beers
that
im
drinking
but
in
the
case
of
the
beers
from
this
case
i
will
make
an
exception
there
is
non
freshness
date
on
these
bottles
however
there
is
a
very
clear
best
before
stamp
on
the
case
and
it
claims
that
i
should
have
drank
this
by
020307
i
can
only
guess
that
weyerbacher
puts
the
date
on
the
case
because
they
are
from
pa
and
we
here
generally
have
to
buy
by
the
case
still
it
would
be
nice
if
it
was
on
the
bottle
12oz
brown
bottle
from
florians
cloudy
though
surprisingly
clear
for
the
style
imo
orangeyellow
body
with
almost
no
head
smells
like
orange
apricot
with
hints
of
spice
and
alcohol
tastes
like
orange
pith
spice
with
bits
of
banana
and
nut
and
hints
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
lighter
in
body
than
expected
and
thus
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
9
3abv
tripel
the
alcohol
could
be
a
bit
better
hidden
but
other
than
that
ihis
is
a
pleasant
drinkable
ale
d
did
weyerbacher
change
the
recipe
or
have
my
tastes
evolved
that
much
i
remember
having
this
before
and
thinking
that
it
was
absurdly
sour
lemony
and
rather
unpleasant
this
time
i
am
finding
it
to
be
exceptionally
pleasant
it
takes
like
a
tripel
this
time
and
not
like
a
lemonstrosity
had
with
dark
chocolate
truffles
and
chedder
cheese
certainly
not
an
ideal
pairing
but
it
was
still
very
good
wow
considering
this
ones
price
and
availability
on
top
of
its
sheer
awesomeness
this
ones
amazing
this
beer
just
speaks
to
me
the
head
is
huge
after
the
intial
pour
and
slowly
disapates
egg
shell
colored
head
that
is
tight
and
not
too
airy
the
golden
straw
color
is
pleasent
the
smell
of
apples
pears
oranges
yeast
and
alcohol
very
fruity
with
a
sturdy
malt
backbone
subtle
english
hops
peak
through
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
there
is
a
spicy
chracter
that
emerges
a
little
bit
past
the
middle
of
the
taste
the
complexity
of
flavors
and
levels
that
exsist
in
this
amazing
ale
are
wonderful
the
abv
is
hidden
very
well
and
the
alcohol
that
is
present
is
at
a
perfect
level
very
easy
to
get
lost
in
this
superb
beer
on
a
critical
note
this
brew
lacks
sexy
bands
of
belgium
lace
drinkability
this
beer
hides
its
abv
very
well
making
it
somewhat
dangerous
if
youre
not
careful
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
tripel
i
do
have
to
say
that
ive
had
bottles
in
the
past
which
had
a
bit
of
a
sour
taste
so
it
is
possible
as
with
any
beer
that
a
single
bottle
is
not
representative
of
the
actual
beer
i
prefer
merry
monks
to
the
aged
prophecy
although
i
generally
prefer
the
other
aged
beers
from
weyerbacher
over
their
standard
issue
counterparts
do
not
hesitate
to
try
this
beer
drinkability
a
nice
sweet
and
fruity
tripel
drinkability
very
sweet
ale
but
very
enjoyable
goes
down
smooth
and
packs
a
punch
liked
this
much
more
than
middle
agess
tripel
crown
drinkability
this
is
a
very
moderate
tripel
so
im
going
to
rate
drinkability
high
here
it
has
nice
flavors
and
isnt
overbearing
in
any
particular
dimension
alcohol
while
high
is
well
hidden
clear
gold
with
a
fluffy
bright
white
head
that
fell
quickly
to
a
longlasting
ring
some
spotty
lacing
aromas
of
bready
malt
light
yeast
cloves
fruit
lemon
and
alcohol
pretty
well
put
together
the
flavour
starts
out
with
ripe
fruit
and
bread
but
everything
falls
away
by
the
mid
leaving
a
bit
of
lemon
clove
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
bodys
on
the
full
side
just
a
bit
sticky
with
fairly
low
carbonation
given
the
big
head
produced
during
the
pour
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
presence
is
warming
the
fruit
character
decent
not
bad
at
all
not
a
bad
triple
but
not
a
great
one
either
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
and
i
find
that
that
oak
aging
helps
this
a
bit
as
seen
in
prophecy
not
very
complex
this
one
could
se
a
bit
of
help
either
way
i
still
love
the
weyerbacher
products
give
this
one
a
shot
its
worth
the
2
or
so
that
a
bottle
costs
this
poured
a
golden
straw
with
a
very
thin
head
almost
nonexistent
but
what
is
present
swirls
within
the
glass
and
is
active
the
smell
is
of
fruits
and
spices
as
one
would
expect
but
with
some
mild
smokiness
to
compliment
the
malty
sugars
this
smokiness
is
not
present
in
the
taste
but
the
spices
come
through
with
more
strength
with
fruits
mainly
pears
and
apples
active
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
but
very
smooth
goes
down
well
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
tasting
making
me
want
to
have
more
than
one
merry
monks
would
make
a
great
750ml
or
22oz
bottle
but
all
ive
ever
seen
of
this
is
6
packs
which
i
dont
see
myself
buying
again
merry
monks
poured
hazy
and
a
deep
apricot
color
with
a
good
thick
head
the
nose
was
spicy
with
banana
odor
the
beer
came
on
full
force
but
there
was
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
was
fizzy
in
the
mouth
i
am
not
sure
i
would
drink
many
of
these
in
a
session
d
not
a
huge
fan
of
tripels
and
definately
not
a
fan
of
this
one
abbrasive
and
off
balance
i
finished
this
beer
but
wont
be
drinking
it
again
drinkability
to
me
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
not
the
greatest
at
judging
belgian
styles
yet
still
a
novice
with
the
belgian
styles
i
will
buy
a
few
more
of
these
drink
a
few
fresh
and
cellar
a
few
as
well
light
yellow
in
color
with
virtually
no
head
the
smell
is
like
lemongrass
the
taste
is
quite
strong
the
alcohol
is
prominate
and
the
beer
has
a
witbierlike
taste
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
the
alcohol
puts
forth
a
nice
burn
but
overall
this
is
not
particularly
my
favorite
of
the
belgian
beers
i
have
tried
i
may
come
back
to
this
once
i
get
accustomed
to
the
style
bottom
line
its
no
allagash
but
this
is
a
decent
tripel
and
worth
a
shot
im
still
wondering
why
unnamed
bar
gave
me
a
pint
of
the
stuff
at
9
3
its
almost
as
if
they
want
their
customers
to
get
drunk
and
order
more
or
something
drinkability
a
nice
sipping
belgian
good
for
a
cold
midwestern
night
this
one
develops
and
opens
up
as
it
warms
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
a
decent
beer
for
a
powerful
punch
i
wouldnt
choose
this
but
would
never
refuse
it
if
offered
though
it
doesnt
take
a
genius
i
could
tell
this
was
a
tripel
based
on
the
medium
pale
color
fruity
esters
and
hoppy
taste
medium
body
and
just
a
bit
of
head
lots
of
carbonation
a
good
tripel
but
nothing
fantastic
still
yet
to
find
an
average
or
below
beer
from
weyerbacher
drinkability
this
brew
is
kind
of
an
enigma
for
me
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
dont
go
together
and
it
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
enjoy
oelergud
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
fantastic
tripel
the
flavor
is
excellent
and
makes
for
a
refreshing
easy
drinker
its
a
bit
sweet
but
the
spices
are
well
balanced
for
wonderfully
balanced
tripels
id
recommend
this
for
those
who
favor
the
fruitssweet
somewhat
and
golden
monkey
for
those
who
prefer
exotic
spices
another
winner
from
weyerbacher
pours
a
clear
golden
nice
color
thick
white
head
forms
but
disappears
pretty
quick
settles
to
a
thin
layer
some
lacing
smell
is
tons
of
diacetyl
very
buttery
booze
citrus
toffee
spice
weird
taste
is
buttery
as
well
citrus
bread
yeast
alcohol
some
fruit
lot
of
heat
in
the
finish
slightly
unpleasant
but
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
hot
cheers
the
lighter
body
enhances
the
drinkability
as
well
as
the
fact
that
there
is
no
sign
of
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
im
serious
youd
think
this
beer
was
around
4
abv
and
not
9
one
of
the
lightest
belgiums
ive
had
which
for
me
makes
it
very
drinkable
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
got
to
say
taste
is
sugary
sweet
perhaps
too
sweet
taste
of
tropical
fruits
with
little
hops
presence
actually
a
pretty
decent
stab
at
the
style
if
the
sweetness
was
held
in
check
a
little
better
this
would
be
a
winner
d
a
little
sweet
and
boozy
but
very
drinkable
got
this
from
skinnyelvis
in
secretsanta
06
pours
with
an
almost
clear
sunny
orange
color
not
much
head
but
a
nice
white
ring
sticks
around
the
carbonation
appears
somewhat
low
the
smell
is
dominated
by
banana
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
citrus
spice
in
the
background
am
i
smelling
a
bavarian
hefe
the
smell
is
not
real
complex
but
its
pleasantly
sweet
more
banana
and
bready
malt
in
the
taste
some
light
spiciness
with
a
sweet
alcohol
finish
also
pretty
unremarkable
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
but
not
as
much
as
a
strong
belgian
could
have
this
was
just
a
slightly
above
average
beer
it
would
need
alot
more
depth
to
stack
up
there
with
the
finer
tripels
regardless
being
flatish
with
no
head
leans
twords
old
age
or
neglect
drinkability
a
fine
american
replication
of
a
european
style
da
kinda
funky
for
this
style
not
the
best
ive
seen
and
at
9
3
abv
its
not
exactly
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
effort
aftertaste
is
only
slightly
sweet
with
the
lemon
drying
your
mouth
and
asking
for
another
sip
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
my
maredsous
chalice
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
barely
half
an
inch
of
white
head
smells
of
yeast
spice
malt
apple
and
clove
tastes
of
sweet
apples
and
pears
with
a
spiciness
that
tingles
the
tongue
moderately
carbonated
and
finishes
with
a
dry
mild
hop
bitterness
the
high
alcohol
is
nicely
disguised
a
very
good
tripel
from
dan
weirback
co
taste
is
sweet
lots
of
fruit
banana
pear
spices
yeast
and
mild
hops
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
for
a
trippel
not
super
drinkable
for
me
because
of
an
unmasked
alcohol
note
overall
a
tasty
tripel
very
tastey
and
enjoyable
though
one
was
just
enough
for
me
i
had
a
pleasant
warmth
and
a
slight
buzz
after
one
great
for
a
cold
rainy
day
drinkability
pretty
good
no
westmalle
tripel
but
certainly
a
good
one
since
i
like
the
style
a
lot
im
sure
ill
pick
it
up
again
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
golden
yellow
slightly
hazy
with
a
nice
white
head
pretty
lacing
after
the
head
dissipates
pleasant
fruity
aroma
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
nice
undertones
of
yeasty
earthiness
good
mouthfeel
not
overly
carbonated
fairly
dry
aftertaste
extremely
drinkable
for
9
3
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticable
better
than
some
tripels
from
belgium
that
ive
tasted
d
pretty
damn
tasty
tripel
smooth
and
silky
with
a
slightly
high
abv
thats
noticeable
in
a
warming
of
the
chest
very
drinkable
with
a
medium
body
thats
that
actually
a
bit
lighter
than
it
starts
out
as
well
this
is
certainly
a
nice
tripel
this
is
a
very
fresh
sample
so
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
my
remaining
bottles
age
and
i
suspect
that
it
will
become
even
better
fans
of
this
style
should
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
i
dont
remember
this
beer
being
so
good
in
the
past
and
im
glad
i
gave
it
another
try
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
and
somewhat
syrupy
not
sure
that
id
enjoy
having
more
than
one
of
these
drinkability
was
a
bit
low
as
well
the
sweetness
made
this
almost
more
of
a
soda
than
a
beer
drinkability
alcohol
and
acidic
notes
need
to
toned
down
or
better
hidden
this
tripel
was
too
winelike
for
me
and
ive
yet
to
find
a
wine
that
i
like
no
flaws
or
defects
a
wonderful
beer
pours
gold
with
a
nice
head
which
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
smell
has
grape
notes
white
wine
alcohol
is
also
present
in
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
then
tart
finishes
with
a
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
nicely
carbonated
light
enough
to
be
pretty
drinkable
decent
stuff
the
beer
is
quite
a
bit
drier
than
i
was
expecting
in
fact
it
actually
does
have
a
light
tartness
to
it
that
almost
seems
like
lactic
acid
it
is
not
so
pronounced
that
i
am
sure
that
it
is
not
just
the
yeast
whatever
the
tartness
actually
adds
to
the
complexity
and
balance
of
this
brew
that
same
earthyspiciness
that
is
in
the
aroma
is
here
in
the
flavor
but
it
is
actually
balanced
out
quite
a
bit
by
the
subtle
sour
notes
flavors
that
pop
into
my
head
as
i
contemplate
this
brew
notes
of
lemon
a
bit
of
chalk
some
green
apple
notes
perhaps
a
touch
of
celery
root
that
might
be
a
stretch
but
there
is
something
here
i
am
trying
to
describe
some
star
fruit
and
even
a
touch
of
kiwi
fruit
the
finish
has
a
hint
of
phenolic
notes
and
hot
higher
alcohols
character
that
almost
serve
the
same
function
as
hop
bitterness
both
of
these
components
are
subtle
enough
to
only
add
to
the
overall
experience
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
surprisingly
dry
i
was
expecting
something
much
sweeter
than
this
pretty
yellow
amber
color
with
tons
and
i
mean
tons
of
carbonation
38th
inch
bubbly
white
head
with
flawless
retention
great
looker
aroma
is
like
many
americanized
belgians
banana
yeast
candied
sugar
and
a
touch
of
the
tropics
slight
hints
of
cotton
candy
to
boot
taste
matches
aroma
with
some
strong
sensations
of
rum
like
alcohol
sugars
warming
sweet
and
boozy
with
minimal
character
or
depth
d
a
delicious
version
of
a
belgian
golden
ale
overall
the
high
alcohol
is
not
only
not
disguised
but
disguises
the
flavors
in
this
beer
tone
the
alcohol
down
and
let
the
flavor
shine
tough
1
to
drink
this
one
is
a
decent
beer
overall
definately
worth
a
try
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
quicklydisappearing
head
smells
of
spice
orange
and
a
little
alcohol
tastes
warm
with
a
slight
bite
the
orange
aroma
comes
out
as
the
alcohol
warms
the
back
of
your
throat
aftertaste
is
pretty
sweet
but
very
drinkable
if
you
like
sweet
banana
smoothies
adult
smoothies
that
is
this
is
right
up
your
alley
and
this
one
really
hits
you
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
a
solid
belgian
style
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisp
and
very
sweet
maybe
one
or
two
of
these
is
about
all
i
can
handle
no
hop
bitterness
or
any
bitterness
for
that
matter
drinkable
good
and
definitely
better
from
the
bottle
than
it
was
ontap
booze
is
for
the
most
part
deceptively
well
hidden
making
this
a
beer
you
could
settle
on
for
a
while
probably
not
as
light
in
the
body
or
as
complex
in
the
fruits
as
belgian
representatives
of
the
style
but
a
solid
american
rendering
nonetheless
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
and
sediment
in
the
beer
the
smell
is
a
light
citruslemon
and
wheat
aroma
the
taste
has
a
tart
citrus
flavor
with
wheat
candy
sugar
and
fruit
pear
the
mf
is
light
and
crisp
very
refreshing
the
flavors
mix
well
and
the
high
alcohol
content
is
very
well
hidden
a
very
good
beer
but
the
high
alcohol
does
sneak
up
on
you
be
warned
cheers
still
a
nice
drinker
and
enjoyable
d
like
all
weyerbacher
stuff
ive
had
this
is
very
drinkable
an
impressive
american
belgian
tripel
pretty
drinkable
this
is
a
good
one
but
you
must
like
your
tripels
sweet
fairly
light
in
body
a
lot
of
carbonation
though
not
too
much
something
about
belgian
tripels
limits
my
drinkability
of
them
however
although
it
isnt
stunningly
brilliant
the
merry
monk
is
a
solid
take
on
the
style
im
not
quite
sure
how
this
one
fares
as
a
tripel
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
and
an
interesting
belgian
style
cheers
and
heres
too
all
of
the
teams
in
the
world
cup
enjoy
this
month
a
vigorous
pour
yields
a
slightly
hazy
golden
body
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
notes
of
candy
sugar
yeast
bread
dough
fruits
pear
apple
white
grape
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
is
yeasty
with
fruit
notes
apple
and
pear
some
candy
sugar
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
descent
an
ok
tripel
might
get
better
with
some
age
another
decent
offering
from
weyerbacher
pours
deep
gold
with
a
hazed
clarity
and
lots
of
rapidly
rising
tiny
bubbles
dense
soap
bubble
head
of
two
fingers
and
decent
retention
scarce
and
spotty
lacing
mild
belgian
phenolic
nose
of
banana
and
plastic
with
a
weak
pale
malt
aroma
sweet
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
candi
sugar
alcohol
spice
crisp
pilsener
and
yeast
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
flash
of
alcohol
and
mild
golding
hop
bitterness
tame
in
every
way
except
the
fusel
burn
medium
body
and
carbonation
but
a
fine
crispyness
allows
the
big
flavor
without
being
too
residual
sweet
faint
hop
bitterness
and
mild
yeast
bite
in
the
finish
and
the
alcohol
is
perhaps
a
little
more
evident
than
appropriate
this
drinks
easy
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
bomber
looks
like
strawberry
juice
a
bit
of
head
a
hint
of
lacing
smells
lemony
and
hoppy
bready
definitely
bready
tastes
a
bit
alcoholic
a
bit
yeasty
and
fruity
peachy
apricoty
that
kind
of
thing
strong
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
wet
for
a
9
beer
this
is
damn
drinkable
this
will
knock
you
on
your
bum
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
by
no
means
shabby
poured
a
golden
raisin
color
with
a
cloudy
body
leaving
a
thick
white
head
that
disappears
but
leaves
a
small
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
yeasty
and
earthy
the
flavor
starts
fruity
on
the
palate
sweet
ripened
grapes
banana
mango
and
a
slight
alcohal
presence
but
9
it
is
very
faint
the
finish
is
smooth
and
coats
the
throat
very
complex
and
delicious
this
is
a
beer
i
will
go
back
to
again
cheers
the
aroma
wafting
from
this
semigolden
ale
is
tart
green
apple
with
just
a
hint
of
funk
if
anything
perhaps
the
aroma
is
a
little
on
the
mild
side
the
flavors
are
instantly
tart
with
fleeting
acidity
malt
enters
midpalate
and
dissolves
into
a
revisiting
of
this
tartness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
pleasing
quality
entry
this
is
quite
a
pleasant
beer
but
it
isnt
going
to
make
belgian
tripels
jealous
if
you
love
the
flavor
of
banana
and
i
do
then
you
are
going
to
love
this
this
might
not
be
a
world
class
beer
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
quite
nice
drinker
tasty
and
fruity
this
would
be
fantastic
with
a
dessert
featuring
fruit
and
bananas
or
strawberries
in
particular
would
also
be
great
with
chocolate
overall
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
not
the
best
but
this
one
wont
let
you
down
either
served
on
tap
in
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
clear
glowing
gold
with
a
thin
ring
of
offwhite
head
nose
is
very
fruity
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
with
a
faint
whiff
of
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
taste
starts
out
with
a
sweet
doughy
malt
which
quickly
gives
way
to
very
sweet
fruitiness
citrus
apple
pineapple
finish
is
peppery
and
somewhat
alcoholic
leaving
a
lingering
warmth
in
the
throat
medium
bodied
and
slightly
syrupy
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
couldnt
drink
too
many
at
once
but
this
is
a
pretty
solid
local
tripel
the
sweetness
of
this
ale
is
just
a
bit
over
the
top
for
my
likings
light
gold
color
cidery
plastic
and
glue
laden
nose
with
hints
of
apple
and
pear
pretty
vibrant
but
not
exactly
nice
smelling
sweet
tasting
with
an
undeniable
plastic
feel
in
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
mostly
apple
and
pear
flavors
with
well
hidden
alcohol
but
this
is
a
typical
american
belgian
creation
not
that
good
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
am
convinced
to
continue
trying
tripels
whenever
i
have
the
opportunity
i
like
weyerbachers
plain
and
unassuming
label
they
clearly
want
the
beer
to
speak
for
itself
this
label
features
monks
tying
one
on
in
the
cellar
of
their
monastary
by
candlelight
i
have
to
say
that
i
cant
blame
them
ive
had
this
one
in
the
cellar
for
almost
a
year
pours
a
dark
golden
color
no
head
at
all
on
this
one
but
its
not
flat
there
is
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
goblet
smell
is
very
fruity
my
first
impression
was
appricot
other
smells
that
come
through
are
the
high
alcohol
and
a
candy
sweetness
the
taste
gives
you
a
big
blast
of
sweetness
up
front
eventually
some
yeast
spicyness
comes
through
and
it
finishes
with
some
alcohol
burning
notes
this
is
definately
a
sipper
which
fits
the
style
an
ok
attempt
at
the
style
but
i
cant
whole
heartedly
recomend
this
one
so
refreshing
that
i
cant
consider
it
anything
but
highly
drinkable
that
lively
and
complex
flavor
and
overall
refreshing
personality
will
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
the
more
weyerbacher
i
try
the
more
i
dont
want
to
try
anything
else
they
make
its
an
ok
triple
but
just
misses
the
key
points
im
not
sure
if
its
the
yeast
strain
or
what
but
its
sort
of
like
looking
at
pictures
negative
its
sort
of
a
triple
in
reverse
all
the
flavors
you
want
to
taste
are
subtle
then
the
subtle
balancing
flavors
are
in
the
forefront
its
definatly
a
unique
beer
but
it
basically
tastes
imo
like
a
poor
american
attempt
at
a
belgian
everything
about
this
seemed
muddled
to
me
the
look
the
smell
the
taste
the
feel
stuff
was
out
of
place
this
does
taste
like
a
logical
progression
between
a
dubbel
and
quadrupel
butand
it
tastes
unfinished
in
that
way
malty
sweet
without
some
of
the
tartness
or
dryness
ive
gotten
out
of
the
better
tripels
out
there
bottle
poured
a
shiny
yellow
color
ale
with
a
medium
white
foamy
head
with
great
retention
aroma
is
quite
sweet
but
i
could
not
find
any
trace
of
yeast
taste
is
also
very
candylike
sweet
with
a
thinner
body
then
expected
seems
like
this
was
filtered
and
it
is
a
shame
because
it
leaves
the
beer
a
bit
onedimensional
so
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
lacking
complexity
this
one
grew
on
me
quickly
this
poured
a
nice
hazy
orange
color
with
a
very
small
head
nice
lacing
there
was
lots
of
crap
floating
around
inside
the
aroma
punches
you
in
the
face
and
at
first
was
not
very
pleasantit
kinda
of
smelled
like
wood
stain
but
the
sweet
fruityness
saves
the
day
very
nice
and
aromatic
medium
body
here
if
i
had
to
make
up
a
word
to
describe
the
flavor
i
would
use
woodberry
because
it
tastes
woody
and
has
some
berry
flavor
there
is
even
a
hint
of
snapple
tea
nutty
also
the
flavors
are
kinda
weird
at
first
and
i
havent
had
a
tripel
quite
like
this
before
but
it
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
one
i
have
had
just
give
it
a
good
amount
of
sippage
and
it
will
grow
on
you
and
feel
right
at
home
in
your
mouth
nice
and
complex
not
bad
typical
wyerbacher
drinkability
id
say
is
high
not
in
the
league
of
rochefort
or
westy
but
nice
never
the
less
worth
a
go
although
this
has
a
high
abv
you
dont
really
detect
a
strong
alcohol
presence
overall
glad
to
see
it
in
the
variety
pack
has
the
weyerbacher
distinct
characteristics
wouldnt
but
a
whole
case
of
this
stuff
poured
a
lovely
golden
color
with
orange
hues
throughout
my
petrus
goblet
was
filled
with
foam
that
sat
nicely
and
left
behind
plenty
of
lacing
aromas
of
yeast
alcohol
robust
spices
and
dried
fruit
the
taste
is
just
great
with
lingering
fruitderived
sweetness
that
leaves
a
moderate
to
dry
finish
and
coats
the
tongue
nicely
hints
of
candy
and
sugar
coated
dried
fruit
seem
to
jump
out
as
the
beer
warms
despite
the
high
abv
this
drink
was
very
enjoyable
and
suprisingly
smooth
aging
this
beer
would
give
it
a
more
dry
finish
with
a
bit
more
crisp
texture
this
is
simply
horrible
i
dont
know
maybe
its
me
and
maybe
i
dont
like
whatever
is
going
on
in
this
beer
or
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
but
boy
is
this
bad
i
bought
2
so
i
will
check
out
the
next
and
hop
for
my
4
or
sos
sake
that
it
too
doesnt
get
poured
down
the
drain
like
the
first
one
did
this
is
one
solid
beer
from
weyerbacher
pours
a
cloudy
golden
not
much
of
a
head
and
no
lacing
to
speek
of
smell
was
fruity
mouthfeel
was
like
that
of
a
wine
cooler
in
factthis
beer
tastes
like
a
really
sweet
fruity
wine
cooler
i
did
not
care
for
golden
monkey
the
first
time
i
tried
this
tripel
style
beer
so
this
is
a
personal
taste
issue
just
not
my
style
but
i
wanted
to
give
it
another
shot
anyway
wasnt
impressed
with
either
pairing
1
99
12
oz
paired
with
the
right
cuisine
or
on
a
hot
day
with
this
sufficiently
chilled
it
would
be
largely
quite
drinkable
mouthfeel
a
little
light
i
look
for
more
body
on
a
higher
abv
brew
i
think
it
is
a
bit
unbalanced
and
i
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
this
very
often
but
it
fits
the
style
pretty
well
the
style
just
isnt
my
favorite
i
think
this
would
be
something
good
to
give
someone
who
normally
drink
alcopops
to
show
her
that
she
can
drink
something
that
is
still
sweet
but
doesnt
taste
like
robitussin
itd
be
good
to
have
occasionally
as
a
change
of
pace
too
this
is
a
damn
good
tripel
im
disappointed
by
the
head
retention
but
for
flavor
complexity
and
drinkability
this
would
be
tough
to
beat
highly
recommended
nice
head
initially
like
a
yesty
unibroue
but
then
sour
and
acidic
not
finishable
too
dry
too
carbonated
cloves
are
shocking
to
palate
lemongrass
does
only
sour
it
further
medicinal
and
too
much
alcohol
how
can
this
be
improved
back
to
the
drawing
board
notes
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
pretty
good
one
this
stuff
is
great
but
the
appearance
and
smell
leave
something
to
be
desired
pours
a
nice
dark
honey
color
great
color
but
wheres
the
head
im
asking
you
where
the
f
did
it
go
i
see
no
head
i
like
some
head
on
my
belgians
not
much
carbonation
also
but
i
think
thats
paritally
a
good
thing
i
dont
want
champagne
in
my
beer
nose
is
a
little
subdued
which
is
good
and
bad
its
hiding
the
9
3
really
well
but
its
kinda
weak
minor
fruits
a
little
maltiness
not
much
there
but
the
taste
is
pretty
powerful
good
balance
of
heavy
malts
nice
fruitiness
pear
lemon
and
the
alcohol
is
peaking
out
ever
so
slightly
but
not
acridity
thankfully
mouthfeel
is
moderately
smooth
but
i
think
its
a
little
weak
for
the
style
overall
though
damn
man
i
really
do
like
this
beer
anything
that
i
can
down
and
then
be
happy
for
awhile
is
2
thumbs
up
for
me
music

this
poured
a
clean
golden
color
with
no
head
and
no
lace
the
aromas
were
of
bananas
cloves
and
a
background
fishy
smell
the
taste
is
definitely
belgian
sweet
with
the
aformentioned
bananas
cloves
and
a
salty
malt
kind
of
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
at
first
but
then
leaves
a
gummy
residue
on
the
tounge
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
that
one
can
easily
drink
this
if
you
can
get
past
some
of
the
odd
little
flavors
it
has
noted
by
other
reviews
i
would
have
to
agree
that
this
is
a
boarder
line
siason
the
malt
bill
is
second
to
the
spicehopphenol
taste
and
at
9
5
i
know
why
the
monks
are
so
merry
good
taste
peach
hops
and
malt
in
that
orderalcohol
bite
was
present
but
nothing
like
a
normal
tripel
hidden
well
peppery
bites
cleaned
out
nicely
after
a
bit
although
thick
with
malt
and
spice
this
beer
finished
clean
and
smooth
i
could
have
this
again
drinkability
my
ass
this
is
9
it
only
feels
like
about
4
im
sure
its
at
least
6
but
i
literally
felt
nothing
after
drinking
this
brew
the
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
if
its
correct
im
still
not
buying
it
at
any
rate
its
a
great
tasting
brew
nonetheless
even
though
it
tastes
overall
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
to
me
beauty
clear
amber
gold
almost
honey
in
appearance
34

falls
to

put
slightly
candiish
nose
with
a
grainy
hint
taste
is
heavy
on
the
citrus
zest
and
a
not
pleasant
corny
flavor
bubbles
and
belgian
yeast
attempt
to
bring
it
back
the
mouthfeel
is
full
at
first
and
then
moves
on
to
unpleasantly
astringent
territory
not
helped
at
all
by
the
extensive
zestcitrus
peel
flavors
it
can
be
drunk
fairly
easily
but
there
are
more
enjoyable
tripels
available
this
was
1
69
for
a
single
at
once
upon
a
vine
this
was
something
that
caught
me
completely
by
surprise
in
a
very
good
way
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
hand
wrungdrop
when
the
beer
hits
your
tounge
you
fist
realize
that
you
havent
mmade
your
will
and
by
the
time
your
halfway
through
im
wondering
if
therell
br
enough
time
to
make
love
to
my
wife
this
beer
is
a
distraction
notes
prefer
golden
monkey
for
an
american
tripel
mouthfeel
was
ok
for
a
beer
of
this
high
alcohol
content
but
not
stupendous
drinkability
only
slightly
better
than
average
not
the
best
tripel
i
have
had
i
certainly
prefer
st
bernardus
tripel
however
i
am
eager
to
try
the
bottle
of
prophecy
i
have
in
my
basement
to
see
what
bourbon
cask
aging
will
do
to
it
poured
out
a
light
goldenorange
color
with
a
decent
size
head
that
setlled
down
after
some
time
smell
consisted
of
spices
and
tropical
fruit
very
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
whiff
of
alcohol
in
the
background
quite
a
good
nose
taste
was
good
starts
out
spicy
with
some
bubblegum
like
flavors
big
carbonation
moves
right
into
the
middle
but
in
a
welcoming
way
floral
still
stays
sweet
with
an
underlying
of
spiciness
still
hanging
around
finishes
on
the
dry
side
not
a
bad
tripel
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
but
not
bad
to
have
once
in
a
while
saying
this
beer
is
an
excellent
tripel
does
not
do
it
justive
this
brightly
yellow
fruity
refreshing
beer
has
an
amazing
taste
this
is
quite
a
high
level
of
carbonation
however
you
will
not
get
much
of
a
head
off
of
this
beer
the
sweetness
is
quite
intense
and
feels
great
on
your
pallate
the
alcohol
level
gives
it
that
extra
kick
as
if
goes
down
giving
you
a
fun
experience
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
sitting
around
the
house
on
a
warm
day
especially
those
who
dont
have
to
drive
anywhere
served
cellar
temperature
in
a
tulip
glass
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
is
crystal
clear
goldenorange
in
color
with
a
sodapop
head
poor
head
stability
theres
a
pronounced
fruit
aroma
with
a
background
of
medicinal
phenols
its
sweet
smelling
with
a
little
alcohol
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
peppery
with
a
little
tangy
spiciness
alcohol
warming
is
notable
the
brew
is
not
very
malty
and
neither
is
it
yeastyid
like
to
see
a
little
more
of
these
traits
in
the
brew
light
in
body
for
the
style
very
low
carbonation
and
just
a
little
slick
on
the
tongue
i
could
take
it
or
leave
itit
certainly
wasnt
inspiring
what
threw
me
off
however
and
made
me
not
like
the
bottled
version
as
much
as
i
did
the
tap
is
a
slightly
medicinal
and
metalic
mild
aftertaste
that
i
began
to
notice
more
the
more
i
drank
for
a
beer
truly
impressed
me
on
tap
the
bottled
version
was
a
relative
disappointment
however
still
quite
a
nice
beer
though
i
wouldnt
classify
the
taste
as
that
of
a
tripel
this
one
is
far
sweeter
less
spicy
and
a
little
thicker
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
well
worth
trying
but
if
you
have
the
choice
go
for
the
tap
rather
than
the
bottle
drinkability
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
alcohol
would
probably
catch
up
with
you
quickly
its
ok
dog
a
very
solid
triple
but
not
quite
outstanding
it
starts
off
with
a
nice
straw
gold
color
and
a
big
white
cloud
when
poured
into
my
delerium
glass
nice
smells
of
fruitysweet
malt
with
hints
of
hops
it
has
a
strong
complex
malt
flavor
and
is
slightly
under
corbonated
imo
it
is
a
good
beer
and
might
get
better
with
some
aging
12
oz
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
chimay
chalice
pours
a
goldenorange
that
is
very
clear
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
head
is
white
fizzy
1
finger
and
leaves
some
lacing
smells
of
pepper
lemon
grapes
medicine
pineapple
lots
of
malts
and
phenols
it
has
a
medium
body
with
a
big
alcohol
kick
phenols
all
over
the
palate
cloves
medicine
pepper
maybe
a
bit
of
banana
it
is
fairly
bitter
with
tingly
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
is
too
noticeable
in
the
taste
decent
i
think
its
better
with
food
than
by
itself
this
beer
is
a
deep
honey
color
that
foamed
slightly
upon
pouring
but
it
faded
to
a
weather
pattern
thinly
covering
the
top
light
citrus
nose
is
a
good
indication
of
the
flavor
taste
is
fruity
of
lemon
not
much
of
an
after
tatse
mouthfeel
is
thin
which
suits
the
crisp
flavor
overall
a
decend
version
of
the
belgian
style
golden
ale
i
would
recommend
another
good
beer
from
weyerbacher
this
is
nice
and
good
but
it
seems
to
be
lacking
something
boldness
sharpness
of
flavors
that
keep
if
from
being
great
having
said
that
i
wouldnt
discourage
anyone
from
trying
it
its
worth
it
too
sweet
to
be
drinkable
for
me
i
may
not
be
able
to
get
through
this
one
too
young
i
am
now
aging
my
other
bottles
for
a
year
or
more
before
i
revisit
this
one
the
alcohol
is
a
knockout
punch
covering
up
the
full
expression
of
the
other
flavors
decent

smell
is
sorta
yeasty
spicy
not

taste
has
waaay
too
much
alcohol
up
front
not
very
well
balanced
still
it
has
some
nice
yeasty
spicyness
and
some
hints
of
apples
etc
not
very
drinkable
due
to
its
unbalanced
characteristics
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
weyerbachers
beers
they
all
seem
to
have

with
a
moderate

with
nice
scents

the
taste
was
good
without
being
overpowering
and
got
better
as
it
warmed
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
recommend
it
merry
monks
ale
hews
pretty
closely
to
the
belgian
tripel
blueprint
and
is
a
more
than
respectable
american
version
its
close
to
being
very
good
and
its
faults
are
minor
at
best
bottom
line
this
is
good
beer
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
for
the
bottle
overall
a
very
good
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
very
solid
and
traditional
nothing
wacky
or
unexpected
but
a
wellmade
beer
a
great
beer
to
start
off
a
hearty
meal
drinkabilitynotes
a
very
pleasant
beer
and
recommended
pouring
a
copper
color
into
a
pint
glass
it
leaves
1
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
to
about
nothing
but
the
ale
appears
a
bit
hazy
throughout
aromas
are
of
honey
w
wheat
and
some
brown
malts
some
alcohol
hints
and
sugars
maybe
some
plummy
characteristics
and
vanilla
as
well
taste
is
of
vanilla
sweetness
w
a
sharp
burst
of
sugar
and
even
some
slight
bananas
also
some
alcohol
burn
as
well
on
the
finish
feel
is
decent
carbonation
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
on
the
sip
w
a
nice
smooth
swallow
some
alcohol
on
the
finish
as
well
nice
overall
easy
to

and
enjoyable
i
request
another
please
dark
bronzeorange
appearance
with
very
little
to
no
head
caused
by
a
bad
pour
by
my
bartender
the
smell
of
citrus
consumes
you
upon
first
taste
bananas
pears
and
apples
are
very
apparent
after
each
drink
a
hint
of
cinnamin
becomes
stronger
the
sight
smell
and
taste
of
alcohol
is
quite
obvious
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
have
also
had
this
on
bottle
and
i
was
not
dissapointed
mouthfeeldrinkability
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
ever
have
this
again
there
are
so
many
good
belgians
that
this
attempt
is
hardly
even
noble
enough
to
continue
producing
it
starts
to
cloy
and
the
sharpness
of
medicinal
pepper
and
phenols
with
no
structure
really
cause
this
to
be
a
chore
im
against
drain
pours
but
this
is
the
least
enojyable
micro
ive
had
in
awhile
sorry
weyerbacher
ill
stick
to
the
insanity
and
hope
this
gets
revamped
in
the
future
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
scores
very
well
across
the
board
although
i
have
to
admit
that
i
have
lately
become
very
taken
by
the
belgian
ales
the
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
crystal
clear
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
that
drift
up
the
beer
to
the
top
where
a
cap
of
nice
white
head
which
leaves
pretty
much
no
lace
the
smell
is
heavy
on
wheats
and
lots
of
rich
fruity
spiced
tones
with
a
bit
of
a
rubbery
smell
to
it
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
taste
is
very
full
and
sweet
with
tons
of
malty
cherry
flavors
with
a
bit
of
yeast
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
nice
burnt
dry
hint
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
evident
in
the
taste
as
well
lots
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
it
isnt
shy
about
telling
you
how
much
alcohol
it
has
definately
but
it
is
still
mighty
tasty
weyerbacher
has
been
a
hit
or
miss
brewery
and
while
this
beer
is
not
terrible
it
is
definitely
not
a
hit
overall
impression
a
good
belgian
style
ale
but
not
a
belgian
ale
its
just
not
as
rich
and
full
as
other
offerings
from
this
style
it
seems
to
have
some
flaws
beyond
that
im
thinking
too
much
sugar
in
the
brew
is
thinning
it
out
and
making
the
alcohol
a
bit
hot
also
got
a
slight
cardboard
taste
and
given
this
was
a
trade
and
it
didnt
list
a
date
im
clueless
as
to
the
source
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
however
based
on
other
reviews
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
weyerbacher
brews
hoping
something
will
make
up
for
the
tragedy
that
is
merry
monks
beer
is
good
happy
belgian
style
beering
flavor
is
light
and
fruity
with
some
lemon
green
apple
and
general
sweetness
finishes
very
dry
making
my
mouth
long
for
the
next
sip
to
remoisten
my
palate
a
very
clean
and
refreshing
beer
not
sure
of
abv
but
it
is
hidden
very
nice
to
drink
i
like
the
label
i
have
to
mention
that
the
label
is
almost
like
its
laminated
it
feels
nice
and
looks
nice
i
have
had
weyerbachers
old
heathen
also
which
i
also
like
the
image
on
that
label
is
better
though
but
who
cares
besides
me
wont
be
drinking
much
of
this
one
drinkability
was
good
consindering
i
had
no
idea
the
abv
was
anywhere
near
this
high
until
typing
this
very
good
job
of
hiding
the
high
alcohol
merry
monks
appears
a
totally
clear
dark
gold
with
minimal
head
that
sadly
completely
fades
out
after
10
seconds
and
then
looks
a
bit
dull
expressive
yeast
on
the
nose
reminds
of
raw
pie
crust
good
fruit
esters
range
melon
banana
mango
floral
and
spicymint
jasmine
hops
somehow
manage
to
leave
an
impression
despite
all
the
other
things
happening
while
the
aroma
is
not
all
that
intense
sweet
initial
taste
but
theres
a
firm
hoppiness
developping
in
a
perfumey
and
herbal
way
almost
grassy
i
dont
know
why
i
dont
like
it
more
but
the
hypothesis
is
just
the
huge
competition
level
in
this
particular
style
where
you
need
big
demarcative
aspects
mostly
complexity
appearance
and
balance
to
be
at
the
top
this
one
gives
me
the
impression
of
a
balanced
ale
with
well
contained
alcohol
which
makes
for
a
very
decent
american
take
on
the
style
despite
lousy
looks
it
was
perhaps
a
tad
overexpressive
on
the
yeast
though
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
fluffy
1
white
head
above
the
brightly
golden
brew
head
lasts
well
and
lacing
is
good
aroma
is
wheaty
with
plenty
of
belgianstyle
spicing
taste
is
upfront
lightly
sour
and
fills
out
with
wheat
and
some
light
spices
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
just
not
so
sure
how
we
hit
the
style
definition
if
one
cares
about
such
things
fits
the
bill
tonight
first
off
what
a
great
picture
on
the
bottle
those
are
some
merry
monks
there
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
with
a
good
inch
high
head
head
goes
quickly
dissapating
to
a
white
collar
that
sticks
for
the
whole
glass
nice
lacing
as
well
smells
ridicously
sweet
almost
too
sweet
a
spicy
alcohol
backs
the
sweetness
very
strong
smelling
tastes
great
medium
body
and
carbonation
very
nutty
at
first
with
some
herb
hints
sweet
on
the
finish
with
lots
of
fruits
peppers
and
cloves
are
present
in
the
aftertaste
tastes
much
like
a
saviugnon
blanc
with
age
im
sure
this
will
taste
even
better
i
set
a
few
back
a
very
complex
beer
that
will
keep
you
sipping
fo
a
while
highly
recommended
this
is
an
interesting
change
of
pace
to
the
typical
pale
ales
available
for
that
alone
its
worth
seeking
out
in
a
flight
of
belgian
beers
i
dont
think
this
would
fair
that
well
but
is
a
great
change
of
pace
it
pours
a
nice
cloudy
gold
the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
spice
and
alcohol
with
a
little
bit
of
yeast
and
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
full
it
has
a
lot
of
spice
to
hit
a
little
fruit
really
no
hops
and
it
has
an
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
a
very
nice
sourness
to
it
all
the
feel
is
oily
and
medium
bodied
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
and
you
could
find
yourself
running
through
several
without
taxing
yourself
mute
orange
and
caramel
aromatics
occur
beneath
adequately
fizzy
orangecolored
liquid
on
the
palate
it
is
a
bit
wild
dry
and
aggressive
with
metallic
electric
orange
peel
and
overfermented
bread
flavors
gassy
with
robotfart
metal
belches
replete
with
ripped
stripped
sugars
and
hot
grease
nuances
thin
where
it
counts
hot
where
it
shouldnt
be
this
is
a
careless
industrial
craft
beer
aggressively
alcoholic
and
lacking
texture
a
shame
not
worthy
of
the
description
tripel
i
noticed
that
other
people
were
noting
the
age
of
theirs
i
cant
find
a
single
date
on
mine
cool
lable
though
golden
yellow
in
color
with
very
little
head
even
after
an
aggresive
pour
the
smell
is
great
spicy
and
sweet
with
some
floral
notes
very
little
carbonation
at
all
the
cap
did
fizz
when
i
popped
it
but
not
effervesant
at
all
in
the
mouth
the
taste
is
sweet
and
actually
some
sour
notes
i
do
like
it
but
it
isnt
like
most
other
triples
i
have
had
the
monk
says
shhhh
be
quiet
with
my
negligible
experience
with
tripels
id
say
this
is
pretty
good
with
real
sweetness
and
complex
fruityness
that
make
it
a
nice
relaxing
sipping
beer
dn
i
havent
had
all
that
many
abbey
tripels
but
this
one
seems
a
nice
ambassador
for
the
style
and
being
brewed
here
in
my
home
commonwealth
only
helps
things
nicely
done
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
to
lay
down
in
my
cellar
almost
like
apple
cider
at
times
but
still
a
very
nice
belgian
style
effort
from
a
solid
northeastern
american
brewery
in
my
opinion
this
isnt
very
good
and
im
only
impressed
with
the
smell
overall
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
belgian
abbey
tripel
probably
one
of
the
better
american
belgians
ive
had
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
the
beer
seemed
a
bit
too
fresh
however
and
would
probably
be
even
better
if
it
was
cellared
for
a
year
or
so
giving
it
time
to
mellow
out
a
bit
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
sweet
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
nice
fruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
is
well
balanced
and
full
of
fruity
yeast
and
pale
malt
flavor
it
has
a
bit
of
tartness
to
it
but
otherwise
its
pretty
damn
good
it
has
tremendous
mouthfeel
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
trippel
it
has
good
flavor
a
good
abv
and
excellent
mouthfeel
it
is
a
good
drinker

a

color
in
the

a
one
finger

develops
that
is
very
airy
and
foamy
not
dense
at
all
smell
is
of
yeast
and
sweet
in
smell
maybe
oranges
there
is
a
slight
sour
taste
to
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
lingering
sweet
aftertaste
i
like
in
tripels
a
very
light
and
wispy
taste
to
this
tripel
it
is
very
drinkable
as
a
result
still
there
not
much
taste
a
slight
alcohol
bite
if
you
let
it
linger
in
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
very
wimpy
considering
abv
of
this
beer
it
tastes
and
feels
like
a
watered
down
tripel
sorry
to
do
this
but
this
one
went
bad
so
i
guess
this
is
a
public
service
announcement
on
this
brew
no
head
was
achieved
it
is
cloudy
in
color
and
the
taste
can
only
be
described
as
sour
so
watch
out
for
this
one
try
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
may
be
hard
to
do
as
this
doesnt
come
with
any
type
of
freshness
dating
poured
a
cloudy
honey
color
with
a
thick
white
head
of
foam
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
yeast
is
prominent
in
the
aroma
along
with
clove
and
a
slight
citrus
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
very
effervescent
and
crisp
which
is
true
to
the
style
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
ale
which
is
always
a
good
thing
flavor
is
very
wheat
malt
like
almost
a
cross
between
a
wit
and
a
tripel
pleasant
none
the
less
overall
a
really
well
made
tripel
and
one
id
drink
again
if
given
the
chance
thanks
jason
this
beer
looked
ultra
light
hazy
and
pale
yellow
the
head
was
a
thin
and
creamy
layer
of
foam
the
aroma
gives
off
orange
juice
lemons
and
limes
hard
candy
and
is
overall
sweet
and
syrupy
the
taste
is
very
flavorful
and
gives
hints
of
lemon
meringue
pie
the
alcohol
is
there
but
is
masked
well
this
is
a
deceiving
beer
the
beers
appearance
and
texture
seem
much
lighter
than
they
truly
are
then
after
one
sip
you
are
drawn
into
entire
drink
very
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
weyerbacher
beef
notes
horrible
what
was
the
thought
process
when
putting
this
beer
out
for
sale
big
brownish
yellow
beer
with
a
short
light
colored
head
this
beer
pours
in
smooth
and
almost
immediately
hits
the
nose
with
smells
of
fruit
and
hops
the
taste
is
warm
alcohol
and
brings
with
it
a
fruity
sugary
kind
of
flavor
to
accompany
its
barley
flavor
finish
is
similar
to
white
grapes
this
was
a
great
beer
drinkability
not
bad
but
i
know
the
whole
time
im
drinking
a
9
beer
i
wouldnt
want
many
of
these
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
a
nice
yellow
color
with
decent
lacing
smell
was
fruity
somewhat
like
grapefruit
taste
was
initially
fruity
with
a
nice
tart
finish
surprisingly
the
alcohol
presence
was
not
overwhelming
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
and
the
overall
drinkability
was
good
especially
considering
the
high
abv
a
pretty
authentic
tripel
style
nicely
balanced
with
an
interesting
interplay
of
sugary
sweetness
and
sour
flavors
ill
certainly
get
it
again
although
a
six
pack
lasts
me
a
long
time
im
not
often
in
the
mood
for
belgian
style
beer
these
guys
make
a
good
product
of
which
this
is
not
the
least
hazy
golden
peach
with
a
descent
sized
bubbly
white
head
that
retreats
to
nothing
minimal
amounts
of
lacing
grassy
horse
blanket
musty
belgian
yeast
on
the
noze
full
cabonation
lends
a
refreshing
zest
to
the
body
spicy
alcohol
flavor
full
of
yeast
and
notes
of
cloves
and
similar
spices
not
too
bad
smooths
out
some
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
middle
of
the
road
when
judged
in
the
context
of
its
peers
worth
a
shot
beer
lacks
vitality
and
carbonation
for
style
not
unpleasant
just
as
lively
as
i
would
like
to
see
finish
is
also
abrupt
and
doesnt
leave
any
lingering
tastes

slight

smell
smaller

that
after
the
pour
leaves
the
goblet
golden
slightly
cloudy
pale
look
initial
tropical
flavors
of
pineapple
and
then
the
beer
spices
with
some
touches
of
white
pepper
and
coriander
the
abv
is
quite
covered
as
well
the
mouth
is
very
lively
with
lots
of
little
tiny
bubbles
surrounding
the
tongue
considering
the
abv
it
has
good
drinkability
the
feel
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
finish
limited
drinkability
because
of
the
abv
not
sure
it
really
complies
with
the
style
but
its
darn
good
if
you
like
belgian
clones
you
wont
be
sorry
the
flavor
is
tart
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
some
maltiness
this
beer
has
a
chestwarming
quality
as
it
slides
down
the
throat
it
leaves
a
very
pleasant
serene
aftertaste
that
encourages
to
have
another
sip
let
me
tell
you
at
9

abv
this
is
one
drinkable
brew
amazing
for
an
american
tripel
to
be
this
good
without
the
overspice
weyerbacher
has
proved
theyre
a
quality
brewery
with
this
amazing
style
i
found
this
americanized
belgian
triple
to
be
quite
enjoyable
there
was
enough
going
on
with
each
taste
to
make
it
interesting
and
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
i
would
have
never
guessed
its
alcohol
content
at
9

abv
a
pretty
tasty
brew
from
weyerbacher
weyerbacher
brews
good
beer
although
i
cant
say
this
one
is
among
the
best
of
its
crop
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
that
completely
lasts
and
laces
extremely
nicely
aroma
of
sugar
and
spice
yeasty
and
slightly
fruity
flavor
is
sweet
some
honey
some
spicey
very
enjoyable
mix
of
flavors
fairly
fullbodied
ends
quite
dry
alcohol
barely
pokes
its
head
through
towards
the
end
this
doesnt
seem
complex
enough
to
be
called
a
belgian
golden
ale
sorry
but
its
just
not
worthy
its
a
shame
because
i
thought
that
they
did
a
great
job
on
their
wit
its
fruity
fun
and
high
abv
and
the
alcohol
hit
me
about
34
way
through
my
first
glass
its
pleasurable
to
drink
fitting
for
the
style
and
you
know
i
didhave
a
second
but
futher
samplings
will
wait
for
another
day
this
is
a
fairly
representative
beer
made
by
a
really
good
local
brewery
i
like
most
of
their
beers
this
one
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
little
haziness
thats
nice
it
has
an
offwhite
head
that
is
not
real
long
lasting
with
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
spicey
citrus
fruitiness
the
main
taste
is
a
grainy
base
with
a
citrusy
top
with
some
other
elements
of
fruit
and
spices
it
is
a
complex
taste
it
has
a
hoppy
kick
that
comes
a
little
bit
afterwards
this
is
a
little
thin
feeling
in
the
mouth
it
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
that
is
not
heavy
so
a
couple
go
down
really
easily
part
of
the
big
beer
variety
pack
i
picked
up
todaypours
a
medium
golden
color
with
alot
of
carbonation
a
nice
frothy
white
head
comes
from
the
pour
the
aroma
is
a
little
spicey
and
smokeya
nice
spicey
lightly
sweet
flavor
to
this
beer
pretty
authentic
here
a
powdered
sugar
flavor
lingers
with
the
spicieness
the
overwhelming
flavor
that
i
get
just
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
but
still
a
really
nice
brew
from
weyerbacher
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
a
complex
combination
of
fruit
citrus
malt
and
yeast
were
very
prevelent
in
the
smell
the
taste
covered
the
spectrum
with
strong
citrus
and
sour
tones
balanced
with
some
thick
sweet
malt
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
after
a
quick
tingling
sensation
as
the
liquid
enters
the
mouth
the
sourness
makes
this
score
less
than
good
on
the
drinkable
scale
thanks
to
jcalbi
for
this
bottle
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
whitish
head
that
dimished
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
and
fast
dripping
lace
nothing
sticking
really
smell
has
a
good
yeasty
aroma
somewhat
spiced
and
thick
with
sweet
malts
citrusy
lemon
thats
dulled
down
with
some
clove
and
bandaid
plasticlike
notes
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
quite
good
with
dulled
lemon
and
candish
malts
with
a
soft
front
creamy
feel
and
medium
body
thats
pretty
hefty
in
the
middle
with
a
yeasty
fresh
grab
which
adds
some
spiced
zest
and
drying
notions
late
the
finish
has
some
interesting
complexity
with
the
drying
with
grassy
notes
raw
melon
husk
lemon
peels
a
cottony
fluff
coats
the
inside
cheeks
and
tongue
in
a
later
aspect
well
after
each
sip
this
was
extremely
close
to
getting
4
5
in
smell
and
taste
i
want
to
give
it
those
numbers
but
something
makes
me
want
more
from
it
so
a
solid
4
it
is
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
it
hit
my
head
about
35
of
the
glass
as
it
is
a
very
drinkable
triple
and
i
just
kept
drinking
it
gone
now
would
like
more
but
alas
only
one
was
available
and
i
must
thank
pabobcat
for
it
this
is
the
former
weyerbacher
tripel
just
a
label
change
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
body
that
appears
orangeish
in
the
goblet
and
displays
plumes
of
fastrising
standardsized
bubbles
eminating
from
its
base
its
creamy
white
head
drops
in
size
but
maintains
a
short
lid
although
its
lacing
is
quite
limited
the
nose
is
sweetly
malty
yeasty
and
phenolic
the
body
is
medium
and
its
gently
zesty
in
the
mouth
before
warming
to
become
somewhat
creamy
the
flavor
follows
the
lead
of
the
nose
with
varying
occasional
notes
of
light
rock
candy
bubblegum
honey
vanilla
licorice
and
some
plasticgluelike
phenolics
that
lend
character
it
finishes
dry
with
a
short
note
of
candyish
malt
thats
quickly
washed
over
with
a
slap
of
drying
alcohol
a
decent
tripel
thats
quite
varied
and
nice
drinkability
i
hereby
commit
the
heresy
of
saying
this
is
better
than
allagashs
tripel
reserve
a
very
lovely
beer
priced
at
a
bargain
rate
2
50
a
bottle
i
think
therell
be
a
little
monastery
in
my
cellar
shortly
so
long
as
they
keep
it
down
during
matins
ill
be
happy
this
is
not
a
favorite
of
mine
and
i
totally
dig
the
abbey
beers
it
had
a
nice
look
to
it
with
the
rich
creamy
yellow
color
and
the
nice
little
head
the
smell
was
very
complex
it
had
elements
of
citrus
alcohol
and
other
things
the
taste
was
similar
except
for
the
overbearing
taste
of
an
old
musty
house
with
moth
balls
i
couldnt
finish
it
due
to
the
old
person
taste
it
was
very
rich
as
well
not
one
ill
have
again
oh
well
you
win
some
you
lose
some
merry
monks
seemed
to
be
a
typical
delicious
belgian
tripel
at
first
glance
indeed
it
is
quite
good
but
after
finishing
the
glass
was
not
quite
what
i
expected
an
extremely
appetizing
beer
it
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
dense
white
head
that
retains
very
well
great
aroma
of
spices
and
and
lemon
mouthfeel
is
rather
spritzy
and
carbonated
as
expected
at
first
this
beer
shows
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
citrus
elements
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
it
is
rather
well
hidden
considering
the
abv
of
over
9
however
i
expected
a
big
spicy
kick
near
the
end
which
never
came
instead
it
finished
dry
with
a
candylike
sweetness
this
wasnt
a
terrible
thing
but
not
what
i
expected
and
i
would
have
preferred
the
warming
alcoholspice
finish
thats
the
knock
on
drinkability
still
a
very
tasty
beer
thats
worth
checking
out
thanks
to
francisweizen
for
this
one
appears
as
a
drop
of
sunshine
gold
with
a
glowing
orange
haze
to
it
in
contrast
to
a
white
short
lasting
layer
of
foam
aroma
contains
belgian
spices
sweet
malt
tones
with
maybe
a
touch
of
candied
sugar
and
quite
a
pleasant
citrus
tone
to
the
nose
flavor
is
sweet
and
full
not
lacking
in
any
major
areas
just
a
great
representation
of
the
style
especially
to
come
out
of
easton
pa
taste
contains
and
blends
all
flavors
so
nicely
with
spices
citrus
tones
sweet
fullness
that
stands
up
to
most
competition
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
undercarbonated
for
the
style
but
the
nice
syrup
texture
adds
to
the
greatness
of
this
brew
very
nice
texture
drinkability
besides
the
alcohol
this
one
is
a
very
good
tripel
not
outstanding
but
very
very
good
bravo
i
will
question
scoring
it
as
a
triple
the
others
i
have
had
both
on
site
and
in
tastings
have
been
far
more
attention
getting
i
really
think
this
is
more
of
a
double
triples
as
all
baseball
fans
know
are
rare
f
this
beer
poured
a
clear
gold
color
that
was
decently
carbonated
for
this
style
i
would
have
thought
it
would
have
been
cloudy
or
some
haze
to
it
it
produced
a
foamy
white
head
that
sat
on
top
of
the
glass
it
lasted
fairly
well
then
dropped
to
a
thin
film
on
top
of
the
liquid
it
left
behind
a
decent
lace
on
the
sides
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
fruit
apples
oranges
spices
cloves
bananas
sugar
hops
light
malt
and
yeast
and
alcohol
spicy
and
fruit
comes
to
mind
on
the
nose
the
tastes
were
fairly
similar
to
the
nose
flavors
of
sweet
fruit
oranges
fresh
picked
hops
cloves
peppercorns
bananas
sugar
malts
some
yeast
and
alcohol
but
not
over
powering
it
left
a
slight
alcohol
and
a
dry
spice
taste
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
fairly
clean
and
decently
complex
in
flavor
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
it
seemed
to
be
missing
something
but
drinkable
this
wasnt
a
terrible
tripel
but
it
wasnt
quite
the
sweetness
that
i
find
i
prefer
in
a
quality
tripel
such
as
allagash
a
nice
effort
however
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
if
they
can
improve
in
the
future

just
a
little
lacking
in

to
other

beware
the

abv
very
smooth
and
bubble
gummy
and
exceptionally
drinkable
the
alcohol
creeps
up
on
you
as
the
beer
gets
closer
to
the
end

you
never
really
taste
that
alcoholic

made
with
care
and
always
and
excellent
beer
from
weyerbacher
lets
see
what
cellaring
a
few
bottles
will
do
to
it
in
a
few
months
time
this
beer
poured
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
little
to
no
head
aroma
consisted
of
a
lot
of
different
spices
and
fruits
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
a
full
body
beer
and
pretty
good
example
of
this
style
nice
dry
finish
not
overly
carbonated
which
may
account
for
the
lack
of
head
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
nose
and
taste
is
fruity
there
is
a
high
alcohol
content
but
that
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
by
any
means
there
is
so
much
taste
that
you
would
never
guess
it
comes
in
at
9
3abv
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
syrupy
with
only
a
little
carbonation
there
arent
many
subtle
changes
as
you
move
through
the
beer
the
alcohol
peeps
its
head
in
at
the
finish
beautiful
rich
golden
beer
too
bad
there
was
no
head
that
would
have
made
it
an
amazing
sight
it
smelled
unexpectedly
tart
elements
of
green
apple
malt
and
slightly
cirtusy
hops
in
the
nose
this
beer
was
mildly
tart
and
a
bit
biscuity
the
biscuit
flavor
increased
substantially
as
the
beer
warmed
the
malt
was
held
in
absolute
perfect
check
by
the
restrained
bitterness
and
acidity
at
9
3
abv
there
was
no
foul
alcohol
taste
only
its
warming
presence
the
viscosity
was
ideal
for
this
beer
and
the
carbonation
was
from
bottle
contitioning
and
as
a
result
it
was
light
and
perfect
weyerbacher

a
real
treasure

this

this

brew
from
weyerbacher
a
highquality
trippel
weyerbacher
is
a
gem
for
pennsylvanians
who
can
get
this
beer
for
about
a
buck
a
bottle
this
trippel
is
brewed
just
right
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
sweetness
intensely
fruity
triple
with
the
alcohol
punch
balancing
the
sweet
maltiness
not
as
complex
as
the
best
belgians
but
good
none
the
less
notes
certainly
a
treat
to
try
another
brewerys
triple
remarkably
complex
perhaps
too
complex
if
that
is
possible
it
seems
like
most
of
the
flavours
are
fighting
for
dominance
and
no
one
prevails
if
this
one
was
to
be
laid
down
for
several
more
months
it
would
have
been
a
bit
more
melded
a
great
brew
but
a
little
too
fresh
i
have
a
bias
to
belgian
goldens
so
these
will
inevitably
be
my
higher
ranked
beer
but
this
lacked
depth
it
didnt
quite
linger
as
long
as
id
expect
for
a
belgian
style
ale
a
bit
more
aroma
wouldve
been
nice
too
props
to
a
domestic
brewery
though
for
puttin
out
a
belgian
we
need
more
of
these
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
good
beer
in
fact
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
it
if
you
could
put
this
up
against
a
la
fin
du
monde
and
compare
i
would
love
to
do
that
some
time
i
would
bet
that
there
is
a
pretty
big
difference
i
am
going
to
give
this
a
3
8
out
of
5
overall
i
like
it
and
want
to
drink
it
again
but
ive
recently
had
better
and
can
recall
the
flavors
this
might
be
better
if
it
was
cellared
a
year
o
overall
just
above
average
tripel
it
looks
great
in
the
glass
but
the
smell
and
taste
were
underwhelming
rjt
overall
really
tasty
and
wellrounded
balance
of
flavor
and
lightbodied
enough
to
have
more
than
one
i
particularly
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
o
i
remember
this
being
better
back
when
i
didnt
know
the
style
as
well
o
an
alright
tripel
overal
though
nothing
spectacular
its
a
little
lacking
in
depth
and
body
but
is
far
from
bad
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
mostly
clear
golden
with
minimal
head
and
some
yeast
sediment
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
there
is
some
of
that
banana
and
clove
smell
i
also
detect
the
alcohol
in
the
aroma
this
tripel
definitely
as
plenty
of
banana
expression
in
the
flavor
there
is
sweetness
and
breadiness
from
the
malt
with
some
back
end
bitterness
and
spiciness
the
alcohol
is
detectable
in
the
taste
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
and
not
as
dry
as
typical
tripels
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
an
american
tripel
pretty
solid
overall
not
too
bad
this
one
would
make
a
great
base
beer
for
barrel
aging
nice
beer
i
was
really
glad
i
purchased
this
case
i
wouldnt
pay
top
dollar
for
this
but
it
is
certainly
a
well
made
tripel
and
worthy
of
any
reasonable
price
tag
overall
a
disappointing
attempt
at
a
tripel
alcohol
overwhelmed
the
palate
and
the
flavors
really
seemed
dulled
o
id
take
this
over
some
of
the
belgian
examples
of
the
style
may
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
some
but
i
think
it
really
works
and
makes
for
a
very
approachable
and
delicious
belgian
triple
i
also
see
in
many
of
the
reviews
that
the
alcohol
is
too
forward
in
this
brew
and
i
just
dont
get
that
it
is
certainly
there
but
at
no
time
dominates
the
sip
great
stuff
overall
this
brew
is
very
basic
malt
yeast
and
hops
and
not
much
else
additionally
the
alochol
is
not
well
masked
and
remains
on
the
palette
as
an
aftertaste
overall
another
solid
tripel
out
of
all
the
ones
i
have
had
over
the
years
they
seem
only
to
get
better
with
time
even
though
the
belgiums
have
been
doing
this
for
many
many
years
breweries
over
here
in
the
states
seem
to
be
putting
out
a
good
product
also
plenty
going
on
here
without
becoming
too
unwieldy
or
dropping
the
ball
not
the
most
complex
tripel
ive
had
but
very
enjoyable
one
id
be
happy
to
grab
again
now
if
i
could
only
get
to
the
bottom
of
that
ikea
association
neither
here
nor
there
this
is
a
mr
5
beer
that
doesnt
wow
but
doesnt
disappoint
too
terribly
the
unfiltered
pillowy
peachyicedtea
color
is
the
most
attractive
thing
but
otherwise
this
is
far
too
muted
for
a
tripel
the
aroma
and
taste
that
one
expects
from
a
tripel
salty
hammy
funky
bread
are
present
but
they
seem
unable
to
escape
from
the
padded
bag
into
which
theyve
been
stuffed
you
wont
have
to
work
very
hard
to
decode
this
beer
a
reasonable
intro
but
not
much
beyond
that
overall
i
like
this
brew
the
bottle
conditioning
brought
the
carbonation
level
up
rather
high
after
writing
this
and
reading
some
other
reviews
it
appears
that
the
carbonation
level
i
had
in
this
bottle
might
have
been
excessive
skewing
the
m
score
down
a
tick
i
will
have
to
try
another
if
i
can
find
a
different
lot
overall
while
not
the
best
belgian
triple
i
have
ever
had
very
enjoyable
none
the
less
nothing
stands
out
but
nothing
brings
it
down
overall
moderately
balanced
bottle
courtesy
of
my
sister

moreys
bottom
line
this
just
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
like
them
but
ive
yet
to
have
one
that
i
love
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
hardest
beer
styles
to
differentiate
between
o
havent
had
many
of
this
style
but
i
have
to
say
i
enjoyed
it
now
to
clean
that
sediment
off
the
bottom
of
this
glass
overall
good
but
not
great
the
belgian
yeast
is
the
star
of
this
show
golden
orange
in
color
with
a
heavy
haze
poured
with
a
short
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
that
leaves
random
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
earthy
musty
belgian
yeast
and
banana
aromas
are
dominant
with
hints
of
citrus
orange
sugar
and
booze
medium
bodied
with
rich
lively
carbonation
tangy
citrus
orange
up
front
that
immediately
transitions
to
banana
that
carries
through
to
almost
the
finish
strong
musty
belgian
yeast
flavor
from
beginning
to
end
finishes
with
a
yeasty
bready
aftertase
and
a
definite
boozy
character
not
the
best
triple
ive
had
but
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
overall
this
is
a
brew
i
have
bought
before
and
will
bu
again
i
think
i
aged
some
once
but
it
didnt
change
much
in
character
maybe
a
little
mellowing
notes
well
i
gotta
say
when
i
tried
this
beer
at
just
over
a
year
old
it
was
amazing
more
complex
than
the
fresh
bottles
and
it
really
sang
now
almost
at
2
years
old
not
so
much
kind
of
in
a
quiet
mess
stage
got
a
few
more
bottles
well
see
what
happens
overall
i
am
not
sure
how
old
this
one
is
nice
bit
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
nice
beer
overall
o
i
havent
had
many
tripels
but
this
one
seems
pretty
good
for
an
american
version
would
definitely
buy
again
bottle
into
tulip
sampled
62410
poured
a
beautiful
dark
amber
with
a
bright
white
head
that
fell
slowly
throughout
the
drink
nose
was
heavy
of
banana
peach
and
raisin
as
i
would
expect
from
an
abbey
style
trlpel
it
was
a
little
slick
and
very
creamy
on
the
tongue
but
the
flavors
mixed
well
with
a
slight
spice
bite
at
the
end
to
balance
everything
overall
this
is
a
fine
effort
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
this
was
a
decent
tripel
nothing
too
exciting
from
the
nose
but
the
flavors
and
finish
came
together
nicely
i
try
not
to
be
overly
critical
of
certain
flavors
i
feel
like
a
rating
shouldnt
suffer
because
i
dont
like
one
particular
flavor
but
i
really
freakin
hate
the
intense
banana
vibe
to
this
maybe
if
it
were
balanced
out
by
a
little
dryness
or
spiciness
but
the
brew
is
pretty
onedimensionally
sweet
good
effort
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
spend
the
13
99
they
want
for
a
6er
of
this
this
is
a
pretty
solid
tripel
brewed
here
in
the
u
s
not
bad
at
all
id
have
it
again
stoudts
always
comes
though
pours
an
oragish
gold
color
with
a
tight
one
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lace
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
along
with
bananas
and
citrus
fruits
the
taste
follows
suit
for
the
most
part
belgian
candy
yeast
with
hints
of
banana
and
citrus
flavor
there
is
also
a
spiciness
which
balances
out
the
sweet
flavor
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carboanted
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
the
top
of
the
glass
the
spiciness
of
the
taste
brought
a
nice
balance
to
the
beer
this
is
something
i
would
drink
again
poured
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
biscuity
pale
malts
banana

typical
for

light
sensations
of
clove
and
pepper
coming
in
later
medium
mouthfeel
chewy
and
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
o
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
aroma
it
wasnt
as
complex
as
i
was
expecting
there
was
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
but
still
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
but
it
fell
short
of
what
a
belgian
triple
should
have
it
had
the
basics
but
needed
a
bit
more
o
decent
beer
not
outstanding
but
a
solid
brew
thats
on
the
light
side
for
its
style
i
enjoyed
it
though
and
it
definitely
has
some
potential
w
aging
overall
a
brilliant
beer
from
this
city
one
to
look
for
when
there
drinks
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
want
it
all
the
time
but
the
occasional
sixer
would
work

very
nicely
carbonated
with
a
good
amount
of
smoothness
to
it
this
was
a
medium
bodied
ale
slightly
lighter
then
that
without
any
thinness
though
definitely
not
too
light
or
bad
really
in
any
way
o
very
easy
to
put
back
and
huge
bang
for
the
buck
i
could
see
myself
having
a
grand
evening
with
two
or
three
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
doing
such
a
thing
i
love
this
beer
really
impressed
honestly
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
it
as
i
dont
recall
anything
from
stoudts
being
very
memorable
in
all
fairness
i
havent
given
them
much
of
a
chance
i
will
pay
more
attention
to
them
simply
because
of
this
beer
d
while
im
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
styles
in
general
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
has
held
up
nicely
for
2
and
a
half
plus
years
i
only
had
one
but
it
would
not
be
a
problem
to
put
back
a
few
more
pours
a
cloudy
orangy
light
amber
minimal
white
head
and
minor
lacing
left
on
the
glass
smell
is
strong
of
citrus
plum
vanilla
and
mild
clove
sweet
and
somewhat
creamy
tastes
of
sugary
orange
and
plums
with
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
minor
spicy
overtones
also
with
a
delicate
honey
like
flavor
just
an
average
tripel
from
a
mass
producer
the
beer
has
some
minor
flaws
not
harsh
and
unforgivable
but
not
what
i
would
seek
in
a
tripel
feel
could
use
a
boost
or
three
seems
kinda
dead
in
the
water
to
me
not
lively
enough
is
what
im
trying
to
say
a
nice
medium
body
with
light
carb
and
not
enough
activity
going
on
in
the
mouth
i
need
more
zing
this
just
places
the
fruits
blandly
without
any
crisp
punch
this
is
really
the
only
fault
i
see
in
this
beer
it
really
exceeded
my
expectations
while
i
could
not
drink
a
shit
ton
of
this
i
would
buy
a
sixer
to
drink
throughout
the
year
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
triples
ive
had
recently
at
1
years
old
drinkability
stoudts
makes
some
good
beers
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
they
are
not
a
brewery
noted
for
the
belgian
style
and
this
is
a
good
example
for
why
that
is
the
case
this
is
overly
sweet
and
hot
and
lacking
in
yeasty
complexity
as
i
said
they
did
a
decent
job
better
than
id
anticipated
it
has
that
malt
liquor
thing
going
on
but
a
somewhat
sturdy
base
of
a
triple
underneath
overall
its
character
didnt
at
any
time
strike
me
as
belgian
despite
the
belgian
yeast
in
the
recipe
ill
stick
to
their
other
offerings
d
this
is
not
a
great
interpretation
of
the
traditional
belgian
style
but
not
many
american
breweries
can
do
it
well
i
could
have
another
one
sure
pours
a
nice
pale
straw
color
with
a
little
white
head
and
tons
of
suspended
sediment
smells
of
fruity
belgian
malt
banana
clove
a
little
orange
zest
a
little
caramel
first
taste
is
a
lightly
spiced
belgian
wheat
with
yeast
some
of
that
clove
and
citrus
previously
mentioned
banana
and
some
light
flavors
that
are
escaping
me
at
the
moment
finishes
sweet
and
a
little
thick
a
little
lingering
citrus
and
spice
carbonation
lightens
the
body
to
mediumish
otherwise
it
would
be
a
thick
and
chewy
texture
the
amount
of
yeast
floating
around
was
a
little
surprising
and
it
doesnt
really
settle
out
but
thats
not
really
a
hindrance
easy
to
drink
and
hides
its
abv
dangerously
well
doesnt
taste
quite
as
mature
as
your
typical
triple
but
still
delicious
this
has
become
one
of
my
more
regular
purchases
d
amazingly
drinkable
for
a
9
abv
brew
the
only
thing
that
hurts
this
one
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
lot
of
stiff
competition
in
the
tripel
category
still
stoudts
is
a
very
good
brewery
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
there
are
some
great
belgian
characteristics
tart
spice
sweet
fruits
but
that
nagging
alcohol
burn
is
really
unsettling
maybe
this
one
would
do
better
with
some
age
but
i
really
think
this
is
an
average
american
attempt
at
a
classic
belgian
style
drinkability
a
nicely
drinkable
tripel
if
a
bit
hot
on
the
alcohol
flavors
i
would
have
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
stoudts
has
proven
that
they
can
be
on
the
same
level
or
even
better
than
the
germans
in
the
helles
style
but
the
belgian
triples
are
still
way
better
than
this
one
a
pretty
good
beer
good
flavor
though
not
a
lot
really
stood
out
for
me
but
it
was
very
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
but
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
and
have
a
spot
in
my
heart
for
it
pours
a
largely
clear
orange
copper
body
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
after
one
minute
aromas
are
remarkably
similar
to
those
of
a
german
wheat
beer
mostly
sweet
a
bit
yeasty
and
with
a
whiff
of
sourdough
bread
tastewise
the
highly
effervescent
texture
notes
give
way
to
a
distant
unnamed
dark
fruitiness
a
real
sipping
beer
i
wouldnt
go
for
more
than
one
in
a
session
should
be
paired
with
appropriate
foods
as
well
bolder
foods
like
smoked
ham
or
cheeses
and
whole
grain
breads
or
crackers
not
a
bad
offering
but
my
favorites
from
stoudts
are
the
lager
and
pilsner
styles
stoudts
triple
is
a
slightly
hazy
very
sparkling
golden
ale
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
sturdy
film
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
fruity
aroma
with
notes
of
bananas
clove
peaches
and
phenol
its
medium
bodied
foamy
and
very
smooth
with
a
clean
dry
finish
its
well
balanced
fruity
and
phenolic
it
tastes
very
much
like
the
aroma
its
spicy
and
a
touch
bitter
at
the
finish
this
is
really
tasty
and
drinkable
stuff
bottle
no
freshness
date
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
light
orange
color
with
a
fluffy
1
finger
head
a
very
clean
aroma
with
notes
of
spice
and
belgian
yeast
esters
almost
has
a
metallic
smell
to
is
hmmm
sweet
malt
flavors
up
front
followed
by
notes
of
banana
and
spice
slight
bitterness
and
alcohol
notes
at
the
end
medium
mouthfeel
smell
is
lightly
fruity
the
color
is
orangeish
gold
taste
is
spicy
and
malty
with
a
finish
of
pepper
makes
for
a
very
pleasant
experience
sipping
it
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
a
good
example
none
the
less
and
drinkable
enough
would
be
good
with
chicken
and
pasta
pretty
run
of
the
mill
triple
ive
had
better
ive
had
worse
appearance
was
good
poured
a
nice
2
finger
head
with
decent
lacing
taste
was
good
what
can
i
say
it
tastes
like
a
triple
there
are
better
triples
but
this
one
is
just
fine
for
the
price
it
just
doesnt
blow
you
away
i
love
belgians
and
it
passed
my
test
i
will
continue
to
buy
it
periodically
give
it
a
try
d
very
nice
not
the
greatest
tripel
in
the
world
but
i
would
never
turn
this
beer
down
dvery
interesting
a
little
sweet
but
a
good
balance
of
spice
pretty
solid
tripel
booze
comes
through
a
little
but
not
too
bad
drinkability
a
nice
solid
well
made
beer
worth
drinking
again
even
though
its
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
triples
while
it
lacks
a
certain
subtle
complexity
found
in
the
triples
i
prefer
e
g
la
fin
du
monde
westmalle
it
is
a
wellmade
worthwhile
beverage
that
ill
probably
be
sipping
on
tap
again
one
day
b
for
9
abv
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinking
triple
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
otherwise
its
nice
ill
try
a
few
other
tripels
and
maybe
revisit
this
one
buy
again
no
d
fair
not
a
bad
tripel
not
a
great
tripel
would
recommend
d
very
drinkable
as
usual
carol
and
her
brew
crew
do
a
fantastic
job
of
creating
a
great
brew
drinkability
very
super
easily
drinkable
but
simple
not
complex
at
all
for
a
belgian
triple
lacks
that
secondary
complexity
and
zing
its
not
bad
but
not
great
nice
value
price
was
but
alot
better
still
out
there
poured
into
chalice
lightly
chilled
with
a
soft
shallow
head
that
faded
to
just
a
hint
for
most
of
the
drink
color
was
golden
haze
much
more
cloudiness
than
expected
a
good
again
soft
nose
with
light
floral
notes
with
sweet
undertones
without
any
astringent
alcohol
scent
despite
the
9
abv
taste
again
was
subtle
but
sweet
oranges
subtle
spices
and
just
a
shadow
of
warmth
from
the
higher
alcohol
content
not
bad
its
actually
quite
good
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
warmer
day
out
on
the
deck
or
out
peoplewatching
in
oostende
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
pleasant
no
harshness
at
all
drinkability
is
down
only
for
the
alcohol
content
but
for
a
tripel
i
could
drink
two
of
these
for
sure
overall
quite
a
good
beer
and
ill
have
to
pick
up
more
on
my
next
trip
to
pa
drinkability
is
good
for
this
level
abv
and
strong
flavors
very
nice
d
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
the
sweetness
really
makes
the
hops
too
bitter
the
fusel
notes
works
well
with
the
sweetness
but
perhaps
some
age
would
help
the
hops
fade
had
this
in
a
sample
tray
at
stoudts
brewery
loved
this
one
from
the
first
sip
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
sweet
fruits
and
spices
taste
is
also
of
fruits
and
spices
some
hints
of
alcohol
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fine
quality
brew
overall
i
was
pleasently
suprised
with
this
beer
i
expected
a
darker
heavier
beer
but
found
the
lightness
and
balance
of
this
beer
to
be
well
done
this
is
the
first
stoudts
beer
that
i
wasnt
very
happy
with
d
solid
and
i
could
sit
back
and
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
bought
this
as
a
wildcard
beer
and
was
relatively
impressed
maybe
not
the
best
abbey
ive
ever
had
but
its
certainly
worth
trying
ill
probably
pick
one
or
two
of
these
up
in
the
future
allinall
this
beer
is
great
for
those
of
you
who
enjoy
the
americancraftbelgianinspired
stlye
this
is
one
of
the
best
although
stoudts
is
small
and
largely
unrecognized
they
represent
this
style
of
beer
superbly
way
to
kick
ass
stoudts
notes
nice
solid
tripel
d
not
bad
at
all
definitely
worth
a
try
for
a
tripel
and
non
tripel
fan
d
i
have
found
a
wide
varying
difference
in
this
style
the
common
flavor
profile
i
find
to
be
some
what
consistent
is
the
sweetness
so
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
style
this
one
is
a
good
not
great
i
would
have
this
one
again
i
see
me
drinking
this
n
the
winter
as
a
warmer
upper
d
its
a
good
triple
but
the
aroma
is
lacking
slightly
and
the
spiciness
might
be
a
bit
too
strong
otherwise
its
a
winner
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
though
and
the
longer
i
sip
at
it
the
more
cloying
the
spiciness
becomes
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
not
the
most
awe
inspiring
american
version
but
very
pleasant
bought
a
six
pack
straight
from

pleased
overall
for
some
reason
the
first
time
i
tried
it
about
a
year
ago
i
was
much
more
pleased
with
this
beer
even
still
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
one
all
night
if
i
could
handle
the
morning
afterwards
drinkability
a
slowsipping
acceptable
americanborn
tripel
though
im
quietly
reminded
why
i
havent
regularly
purchased
this
one
in
the
few
years
since
i
first
tried
it
taste
is
very
belgian
as
well
yeasty
bready
and
sharp
thats
about
it
pretty
good
for
an
american
belgian
style
beer
i
bought
this
bottle
at
jungle
jims
in
fairfield
oh
dont
drink
and
review
this
was
a
great
sleeper
of
a
beer
had
no
idea
what
was
going
on
here
pours
a
beautiful
yellowgolden
with
a
fairly
thick
white
head
aroma
is
not
strong
but
malty
and
rather
fruity
mainly
apple
or
pear
malty
flavor
has
a
firm
undertone
of
fruit
almost
like
a
ribbon
of
cider
through
the
beer
texture
is
pleasingly
smooth
and
quite
tingly
and
jazzy
hazy
golden
color
thin
white
head
and
some
lace
smell
is
better
peachs
nectarines
green
grapes
warm

aromas
and
bubble
gum
sweet
rock
candy
taste
fruity
warm
alcohol
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
just
slides
down
waiting
for
the
next
sip
mild
smooth
and
warm
real
nice
just
watch
how
many
you
have
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
i
gave
this
beer
good
marks
because
it
just
satisfied
my
craving
for
a
good
tripel
pours
a
nice
light
gold
some
yeast
some
head
very
little
lacing
sweet
smelling
with
some
clove
and
lemon
very
well
carbonatedtaste
is
better
than
i
had
expected
very
light
and
refreshing
sweet
slightly
unbalanced
alcohol
is
not
too
well
hidden
good
not
great
drink
ability
was
above
average
alcohol
was
a
bit
too
apparent
to
be
session
able
mouth
feel
and
lack
of
a
fluffy
head
were
the
main
things
that
separate
this
beer
for
the
great
belgium
style
ales
out
there
would
drink
again
but
not
available
to
me
locally
and
not
good
enough
to
want
to
trade
for
it
medium
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
be
aware
of
the
high
abv
which
isnt
detectable
in
the
smell
or
taste
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
smooth
creamy
and
very
easy
to
drink
especially
given
the
higher
abv
carbonation
feels
a
bit
light
for
a
belgian
overall
a
very
good
beer
poured
the
nice
yellowyorange
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
style
there
wasnt
too
much
foam
on
top
but
i
wasnt
too
concerned
about
it
this
was
a
very
normal
tasting
triple
i
dont
use
normal
as
a
negative
adjective
it
just
didnt
especially
stand
out
from
other
triples
ive
had
delicious
nonetheless
i
thought
it
was
a
good
looking
poor
nice
color
with
just
the
right
amount
of
foam
it
smelled
great
to
me
hints
of
spice
fruit
and
malt
it
tasted
pretty
good
too
a
nice
full
flavor
their
was
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
aftertaste
however
and
that
turned
me
off
a
bit
overall
i
liked
it
drinkability
sipper
for
me
i
cant
session
these
belgians
tripelsquads
this
beer
is
awesome
on
tap
not
overly
carbonated
like
a
tripel
karmeliet
not
filling
either
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
as
a
prime
example
of
a
belgian
style
tripel
mouthfeel
very
carbonated
bordering
on
too
much
id
prefer
less
with
this
style
keeps
this
triple
from
being
a
smooth
abbey
ale
great
job
imho
looking
forward
to
their
double
ipa
first
impression
wasnt
great
but
it
opens
up
as
it
warms
d
due
to
the
sweetness
you
would
not
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
fairly
drinkable
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
still
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
stoudts
i
think
this
isnt
a
bad
example
of
the
style
again
easy
to
drink
you
should
check
this
out
still
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
sure
how
often
id
want
to
have
something
like
this
3
5
d
not
bad
but
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
aggressive
d
a
great
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
it
isnt
the
best
abbey
style
triple
out
there
but
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
single
bottles
this
is
probably
amazing
on
tap
d
easily
drinkable
nice
beer
but
the
sweetness
is
a
touch
to
much
may
need
some
age
tasty
though
off
the
tap
at
the
american
flatbread
debut
event
this
beer
was
a
deep
gold
color
the
head
was
thin
and
white
it
left
some
decent
lacing
but
didnt
retain
very
well
the
aroma
was
semisweet
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
and
ripe
fruits
the
flavors
however
were
not
so
impressive
too
many
alcohol
esters
and
too
much
fruit
sweetness
that
only
became
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warmed
up
hints
of
spiciness
were
pleasant
but
the
lack
of
hop
balance
added
to
my
issues
the
9
was
well
hidden
however
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
carbonation
pleasant
and
the
body
mediumfull
the
feel
is
creamy
and
a
little
chewy
burns
on
the
down
yikes
a
pretty
good
pretty
sweet
pretty
strong
tripel
diggin
it
the
taste
is
a
bit
tart
and
a
bit
too
much
abv
there
is
a
clear
banana
clove
floral
belgianeque
taste
to
the
beer
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
yeasty
efforvescence
and
mouth
feel
of
other
belgians
it
is
also
less
carbonated
there
is
definitely
a
sweet
honey
flavored
present
with
a
slightly
acerbic
bite
to
it
in
the
finish
especially
there
is
a
flowery
ginger
quality
to
the
beer
as
well
but
the
sweetness
and
the
too
pronounced
abv
do
diminish
this
beer
and
its
potential
this
isnt
a
bad
tripel
it
does
have
a
throaty
abv
burn
that
takes
away
from
some
of
the
nicer
banana
and
clove
and
other
spices
that
get
too
overwhelmed
pours

color
with
a
one

up
of
tiny
bubbles
with
little

and
no

and
some

low
carbonation
low
to
medium

the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
syrupy
but
smooth
solid
drinkability
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
triples
widely
available
pours
a
small
white
head
with
a
clear
orange
body
and
fair
lacing
average

and
hop
flavor
that
is
well
balanced
with
hints
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
and
a
lovely
candi
sugar
smell
this
triple
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
it
is
sweet
lightly
acidic
and
seems
to
sit
on
the
tongue
well
into
the
next
sip
a
good
belgian
triple
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
great
beer
and
a
rather
good
representation
of
the
tripel
fruity
aroma
along
with
some
sweet
and
sour
rather
typical
beautiful
light
orange
pour
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
stays
and
some
decent
lacing
mouthfeel
is
upfront
and
crisp
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
in
a
really
pleasant
way
flavor
is
fruity
with
a
medium
yeastiness
mildly
spiced
wish
this
was
a
touch
more
dominant
sour
apples
keeps
coming
to
mind
nice
one
this
is
typical
americanization
of
a
belgian
style
where
the
brewers
make
the
beer
too
sweet
and
the
esters
too
big
leaving
a
beer
that
lacks
subtlety
still
the
flavor
has
a
pleasant
mix
of
apple
and
berry
punch
flavors
with
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
and
the
9
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
sweetness
however
will
keep
me
from
going
back
for
another
glass
the
upfront
bite
makes
it
less
drinkable
than
other
tripels
pours
a
clear
dark
golden
color
smells
very
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
very
crisp
but
not
as
clean
as
other
tripels
goes
down
very
well
though
very
sweet
malty
with
very
slight
hop
spice
all
around
a
solid
tripel
try
it
bottom
line
the
appearance
promised
a
lot
but
in
every
other
category
this
one
fell
short
for
me
still
its
worth
a
try
as
ymmv
the
drinkability
is
ok
the
brew
tries
to
be
nice
but
comes
up
short
in
the
total
package
mk
a
slow
sipper
enough
trademarks
of
the
style
are
there
to
put
it
in
this
category
but
it
could
use
more
complexities
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
but
thats
about
it
poured
into
my
st
bernardus
watou

a
cloudy

nice

nice
little
fizzy

lots
of

this
is
a
tasty
tripel
thanks
joe
d
the
alcohol
as
noted
is
not
hidden
a
tasty
sipper
but
one
you
notice
and
are
aware
of
as
you
drink
it
not
nearly
the
best
of
the
style
but
not
too
shabby
this
beer
poured
out
a
nice
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
fast
falling
head
and
minimal
retention
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
pretty
much
typical
for
a
tripel
strong
malts
yeasty
estery
and
with
a
fairly
strong
phenolic
scent
you
can
also
pick
up
the
alcohol
through
the
nose
this
is
a
good
tasting
version
of
a
tripel
very
yeasty
with
lots
of
esters
a
nice
warming
alcohol
sensation
and
a
tartcrisp
finish
by
no
means
the
best
tripel
out
there
but
not
bad
a
thin
bodied
brew
with
a
sparkling
carbonation
feel
in
the
mouth
i
found
this
beer
fairly
easy
to
drink
despite
the
9
0
abv
it
seems
to
be
hidden
fairly
well
by
the
yeast
and
malt
qualities
if
you
find
this
in
your
travels
its
worth
a
try
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
is
it
the
best
tripleno
but
still
enjoyable
d
a
bit
low
due
to
the
high
abv
this
is
definately
a
strong
tripel
not
as
good
as
the
triples
ive
had
from
belgium
but
a
pretty
good
attempt
at
one
pours
an
orange
color
topped
with
a
thin
head
some
lacing
ends
up
on
the
glass
but
appearance
wise
it
just
doesnt
look
as
good
as
some
of
the
belgian
triples
the
aroma
is
quite
strong
with
banana
citrus
and
vanilla
and
all
of
it
appearing
to
be
quite
sweet
flavor
starts
with
a
spicy
citrus
flavor
with
a
yeasty
wheaty
taste
mixed
in
then
turns
slightly
sour
and
alcoholic
it
does
seem
a
little
like
a
stronger
hefeweizen
but
its
a
tad
too
sweet
the
texture
is
rich
and
syrupy
but
id
like
a
fuller
better
balanced
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
its
hard
to
rate
it
any
higher
when
there
are
so
many
better
options
a
very
solid
triple
in
my
opinion
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
a
very
pretty
cloudy
gold
with
a
white
two
finger
head
the
smell
is
fruity
with
just
a
little
bit
of
spice
comeing
through
this
beer
tastes
very
good
with
fruit
ad
some
hops
and
just
a
little
bit
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
easy
drinking
but
with
the
high
alcohol
9
i
would
not
drink
to
many
definantly
a
good
beer
hazey
deep
yellow
with
an
orange
tint
large
white
head
that
latsed
forever
but
barely
stuck
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
fruity
as
apposed
to
spicey
upfront
the
spice
is
there
but
its
subdued
by
fruity
esters
and
alcohol
along
with
some
sweet
malts
as
well
taste
is
maily
a
sweet
malty
backdrop
with
some
bannana
and
bubble
gum
flavors
overiding
the
clove
and
spice
while
alcohol
and
yeast
are
apparent
throughout
the
feel
of
this
ale
is
admirable
however
the
overall
taste
and
drinkability
is
a
little
off
due
to
the
alcohol
overshadowing
much
of
the
other
flavor
d
at
9
the
booziness
of
the
ale
hits
you
square
in
the
forehead
go
for
two
if
you
have
a
dd
drinkability
is
really
only
average
a
bit
rough
boozy
and
thick
although
if
i
was
out
somewhere
in
the
mood
for
a
belgian
and
this
was
all
they
had
it
would
certainly
work
a
good
brew
but
i
like
the
belgian
brews
where
the
alcohol
is
more
restrained
and
light
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
one
down
more
regularly
overall
i
have
to
say
i
am
disappointed
in
this
beer
if
i
had
just
picked
it
up
from
the
store
on
a
whim
i
would
been
only
mildly
disappointed
but
i
expected
more
from
stoudts
i
have
really
enjoyed
some
of
their
other
beers
and
this
one
just
fell
flat
for
me
i
dont
know
if
the
recipe
needs
to
be
changed
but
i
think
the
fermentation
process
could
be
improved
and
they
can
make
a
much
better
belgian
triple
this
is
a
good
american
try
at
a
triple
i
think
the
brew
still
need
to
be
tweaked
a
little
to
be
up
to
the
other
awesome
brews
i
have
had
from
stoudts
d
one
and
done
not
a
session
beer
in
my
estimation
2
in
my
belgian
lineup
was
this
am
example
bod
1107
pours
a
very
cloudy
light
gold
w
a
thin
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
and
big
chunks
of
sediment
all
the
way
down
my
snifter
a
malty
banana
breadlike
aroma
alcohol
and
darker
fruits
present
as
well
a
rich
malty
flavor
some
hop
bite
initially
as
well
hot
alcohol
and
cereal
grains
a
hint
of
floral
hop
mixed
w
dark
fruit
in
the
finish
a
medfull
bodied
brew
moderate
co2
drinks
like
a
9
00
abv
beer
a
good
brew
for
sure
not
as
quaffable
as
the
westmalle
but
still
a
decent
tripel
d
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
goes
down
easily
and
has
a
pleasant
taste
its
not
as
vibrant
or
complex
as
its
belgian
counterparts
but
good
nonetheless
poured
out
a
gold
hazy
brew
with
a
weak
thin
head
smells
of
sweet
estery
typical
belgian
smell
taste
is
a
bit
odd
sweet
and
tart
a
bit
too
much
for
menot
good
leaves
a
lingering
aftertaste
not
a
brew
ill
buy
again
the
more
i
drink
the
worse
it
gets
tastes
like
a
runofthemill
belgian
tripel
if
there
were
such
a
thing
it
couldnt
hang
with
an
allagash
tripel
but
at
the
price
and
the
serving
size
its
pretty
much
unparalleled
i
assure
you
this
captures
all
the
essence
if
not
all
the
flair
of
the
finest
belgian
tripels
besides
an
average
tripel
is
still
a
damn
sight
better
than
an
average
macrolager
in
my
book
good
creamy
mouthfeel
a
little
strong
on
the
bannana
to
get
a
great
drinkability
stoudts
triple
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
nice
thick
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
dry
chalky
yeast
and
fruity
esters
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sweet
with
plenty
of
pale
malt
and
a
bit
astringent
almost
sour
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
from
the
yeast
just
a
bit
of
the
banana
clove
taste
i
would
expect
from
a
german
wheat
beer
and
the
finish
is
dry
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
for
the
strength
the
odd
sour
astringent
flavor
kind
of
dominates
and
lingers
in
the
finish
and
hurts
what
is
other
wise
a
very
good
beer
d
i
like
this
one
a
lot
and
its
one
of
the
few
beers
my
girlfriend
loves
this
is
the
main
reason
she
agrees
to
go
to
stoudts
with
me
a
heavy
beer
at
9
it
will
do
well
with
spicy
steaks
lamb
or
other
gamey
meats
d
a
very
decent
and
good
beer
easy
to
put
a
down
a
six
pack
and
very
smooth
the
spices
are
a
little
strong
and
might
cause
trouble
for
those
who
dont
like
spiced
beer
d
not
really
drinkable
in
great
quantity
but
a
nice
brew
even
though
its
not
technically
to
style
ill
still
give
this
brew
high
marks
this
beer
poured
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
twofinger
head
the
smell
was
of
yeast
and
sweet
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
a
bit
peppery
melting
to
malty
sweetness
in
the
middle
with
a
little
bit
of
yeast
and
a
punch
of
alcohol
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
with
a
pretty
small
amount
of
carbonation
a
decent
sipping
beer
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
reach
for
it
in
any
quanitity
copped
a
single
12
oz
bottle
from
wine
and
beverage
depot
in
totowa
nice
hazy
and
cloudy
appearance
with
a
frothy
head
that
soon
dissipated
smell
was
replete
with
citrus
florals
and
sweet
ripe
fruit
taste
wasnt
above
and
beyond
for
the
style
but
wasnt
bad
nontheless
very
sweet
and
slightly
cloying
with
strong
sugar
and
candy
essences
aftertaste
is
loaded
with
sweet
candy
and
sugar
as
well
with
a
pretty
good
thick
and
rich
mouthfeel
and
a
slightly
above
average
drinkability
that
took
a
hit
due
to
the
ultra
rich
flavor
and
strong
sugar
notes
present
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
a
sweet
rendition
of
the
style
worth
a
try
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
too
sweet
and
9
is
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
fizzy
and
watery
slightly
bigger
body
and
slightly
less
carbonation
would
go
a
long
way
here
drinkability
is
moderate
not
a
bad
beer
i
wish
it
hadnt
been
so
lightstruck
but
it
still
probably
wouldnt
have
been
what
i
was
looking
for
the
beer
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
into
a
12oz
pilsner
glass
it
had
a
wonderful
sweet
aroma
hops
candy
sugar
and
earthy
the
taste
was
the
unique
bananaesque
belgian
yeastinduced
flavor
with
candy
sugar
and
sweet
malt
in
the
background
outstanding
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
fizzy
but
still
a
great
job
in
duplicating
a
true
belgian
triple
ale
overall
a
tasty
beer
not
quite
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
this
style
a
bit
thin
a
bit
hot
still
worth
picking
up
from
time
to
time
pours
a
slight
clouded
gold
nose
is
extremely
doughy
flavor
is
heavy
with
dough
there
is
the
sweet
tone
as
well
that
is
not
really
overly
strong
it
is
bit
boisterous
and
bright
but
it
is
very
even
and
never
changes
as
it
progresses
feel
is
thick
and
doughy
on
the
tongue
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
tripel
i
say
especially
for
an
american
producer
a
cloudy
golden
ale
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
that
settles
quickly
to
a
thin
cover
of
bubbles
and
fair
lacing
there
is
some
sediment
settling
at
the
bottom
the
aroma
is
a
typical
wheatalcohol
that
i
would
expect
from
the
style
some
sour
apple
the
flavor
is
a
pretty
thick
bready
and
licorice
with
plenty
of
alcohol
this
just
isnt
my
style
it
has
a
nice
mediumheavy
body
with
a
slight
oily
quality
with
plenty
of
fine
carbonation
but
this
stuff
is
just
to
heavy
on
the
alcohol
dominance
for
my
tastes
i
lose
the
other
qualities
its
probably
more
my
aversion
to
the
style
than
to
the
brewer
here
but
i
am
not
into
this
not
at
all
drinkable
as
far
as
having
more
than
one
although
the
flavor
becomes
a
little
more
refined
as
your
taste
buds
try
to
adjust
to
the
alcohol
bashing
got
admit
i
didnt
finish
this
one
and
happily
popped
open
a
luscious
goose
island
ipa
to
relieve
the
crippled
taste
buds
but
i
expect
this
will
do
better
with
the
triple
fans
so
i
tried
to
rate
it
fairly
d
uncomplicated
enough
to
be
quite
quaffible
although
abv
would
make
this
practice
unwise
mouth
hapiness
as
a
local
triple
im
more
than
happy
to
stock
it
for
every
day
tripel
tiple
flavor
is
very
spicy
belgian
spices
and
heavy
on
the
pepper
alcohol
is
evident
fruits
secondary
to
heavy
spicing
as
far
as
tripels
go
i
enjoy
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
reserved
with
the
spices
still
this
is
a
good
tripel
high
abv
limits
this
as
far
a
sessionability
but
definitely
one
to
share
amongst
friends
a
good
holiday
treat
pours
very
dark
for
a
tripel
really
amber
with
some
reddish
tinges
and
no
head
smells
of
rich
fruits
apple
and
pear
and
dark
rich
sweet
malts
this
doesnt
smell
like
a
tripel
it
smells
more
like
an
english
barleywine
on
the
palate
thick
and
sweet
initially
although
some
hops
do
come
up
toward
the
midpalate
and
stay
into
the
finish
the
light
sweetness
of
pale
belgian
malts
is
replaced
with
thick
grahamandhoney
elements
more
befitting
a
barleywine
than
a
triple
overall
this
is
a
poor
example
of
a
tripel
its
too
dark
too
sweet
not
bitter
enough
and
has
some
odd
fruit
notes
style
isnt
everything
of
course
but
i
dont
see
how
you
can
call
this
a
tripel
under
any
circumstances
even
with
no
style
stated
the
flavors
involved
here
do
not
deserve
high
marks
on
their
own
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
wonderful
belgian
yeast
aroma
its
sweet
and
fruity
with
just
a
bit
of
earthiness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
sweet
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
really
fruity
yeast
character
there
is
a
hint
of
earthiness
and
some
warmth
as
well
but
nothing
to
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
drinking
triple
ive
had
better
but
its
a
solid
offering
nevertheless
d
not
a
bad
tripel
but
a
bit
spicy
for
me
drinkability
not
the
first
time
i
bought
it
drinkability
even
the
alcoholic
bite
fades
away
over
the
course
of
the
tasting
and
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
to
compliment
i
would
love
to
pair
this
with
belgian
mussels
or
some
other
light
fare
that
would
let
this
beer
really
show
its
potential
drinkability
pretty
good
this
is
a
great
american
interpretation
of
this
beer
it
is
bold
and
flavorful
and
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
can
be
enjoyed
easily
year
round
d
not
bad
the
only
thing
that
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
many
would
be
the
taste
and
effects
of
the
considerable
alcohol
pours
a
cloudy
orangeish
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
aromas
of
candied
sugar
and
malty
alcohol
in
the
taste
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
very
present
a
bitter
mouthfeel
and
a
malty
and
alcoholic
aftertaste
a
bit
sweet
for
a
triple
but
ok
alcohol
is
not
hidden
and
very
present
overall
its
a
very
smooth
triple
with
a
more
subtle
alcohol
as
compared
to
victorys
golden
monkey
and
a
more
clear
and
concise
flavor
progression
as
compared
to
weyerbachers
merry
monks
which
has
a
lot
of
flavor
it
probably
is
on
par
with
the
latter
brew
and
better
than
the
former
at
least
in
terms
of
local
brewed
in
pa
triples
drinkability
for
me
is
very
low
the
highreal
abv
and
that
it
seems
that
way
makes
this
not
a
sesion
beer
if
you
ask
me
drinkability
decent
but
lacks
the
complexity
of
belgian
triples
and
the
alcohol
character
is
a
bit
too
potent
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
slight
ring
the
aroma
is
some
sweet
malts
and
spice
but
nothing
that
strong
the
taste
is
about
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
most
american
attempts
at
the
style
a
decent
spice
blend
against
sweet
malts
slight
yeast
and
moderately
present
alcohol
syruppiness
the
alcohol
gives
it
a
rather
heavy
body
even
for
9
this
is
another
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
but
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
id
have
another
if
i
wasnt
paying
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
opt
for
it
sorry
if
this
is
an
ignorant
review
but
im
125
beers
into
my
journey
still
a
rookie
i
guess
personally
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
maybe
ill
give
it
another
try
in
a
couple
of
years
when
my
beer
tastes
have
matured
d
a
sweet
big
on
malt
and
fresh
yeasty
beauty
a
fuller
mouthfeel
and
spice
situation
the
great
malt
flavor
and
candy
sugar
complexity
alongside
the
strength
are
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
the
ability
to
drink
many
though
is
average
since
it
packs
a
punch
and
it
is
too
big
to
really
be
considered
above
average
drinkability
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
consists
of
clove
banana
and
sugar
taste
begins
with
a
spicy
clove
flavor
that
gives
way
to
sugary
malt
and
bananalike
backbone
with
a
slight
yeast
presence
and
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
sticky
with
the
aftertaste
hanging
around
long
after
the
beer
is
done
abv
limits
drinkability
but
still
a
great
winter
time
beer
in
my
estimation
belgian
fans
will
dig
this
d
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
beer
mostly
just
because
of
the
alcohol
content
though
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
either
unfortunately
it
was
fairly
expensive
so
there
are
better
options
out
there
personally
i
prefer
river
horses
tripel
horse
or
weyerbachers
merry
monks
drinkability
good
triple
love
this
style
for
the
price
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
rather
high
alcohol
content
well
recommended
light
mouthfeeljuicywith
some
grainyness
the
alcohol
has
the
sneak
up
effect
kidda
kicks
in
when
you
least
expect
it
you
know
it
there
just
dont
realize
how
much
has
some
drinkability
needs
to
have
more
aroma
to
be
more
appealing
just
seems
a
bit
lacking
overall
for
a
triple
drinkability
i
have
to
say
that
this
tripel
was
a
little
disappointing
i
guess
that
i
was
hoping
to
get
a
good
belgian
tripel
at
a
bargain
price
for
an
american
tripel
i
prefer
golden
monkey
but
i
havent
tried
any
of
the
really
highly
rated
american
triples
yet
next
stop
allagash
tripel
reserve
this
is
a
great
tripel
true
to
style
delicious
and
satisfying
every
step
of
the
way
my
favorite
stoudts
offering
so
far
this
looked
a
bit
better
than
average
with
a
very
cloudy
brown
orange
pour
smell
was
quite
nice
with
plenty
of
spice
banana
yeast
cooked
fruit
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
sadly
though
everything
was
very
average
not
bad
just
very
average
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
cooked
fruit
toward
the
finish
and
that
slightly
metallic
taste
that
so
many
tripels
have
alcohol
becomes
apparent
on
the
finish
but
isnt
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
same
weight
and
texture
as
100s
of
other
tripels
again
neither
offensive
nor
fantastic
you
could
do
much
much
worse
i
suppose
still
glad
i
tried
this
d
much
better
domestic
tripels
out
there
than
this
offering
overall
disappointing
and
something
i
would
not
purchase
again
poured
a
fairly
cloudy
deep
orange
color
with
a
smaller
white
head
the
nose
has
aromas
of
candied
citrus
and
fruit
and
just
a
little
bit
of
musty
yeasty
character
flavor
has
just
a
touch
of
what
i
think
of
as
the
tradional
tripel
flavor
its
got
candied
fruity
flavors
mixed
in
with
a
big
sweet
caramelish
malt
body
some
orange
some
spice
hint
at
vanilla
big
mouthfeel
kinda
thick
almost
its
a
good
beer
goes
down
pretty
easy
with
some
good
flavors
just
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
liking
and
a
bit
one
sided
i
plan
to
stock
up
on
these
and
tell
my
friends
about
them
too
they
are
really
potent
however
and
you
shouldnt
plan
on
doing
too
many
physical
activities
except
laying
on
the
couch
im
surprised
and
really
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
drinkibilitygreat
for
the
high
alcohol
content
good
example
of
a
belgian
triple
overall
very
good
i
had
this
on
tap
at
stoudts
it
as
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
cloudy
oragne
color
with
half
inch
white
foamy
head
it
had
a
fruity
smell
and
flavor
it
was
quite
tasty
and
typical
for
a
tripel
orangecitrus
medium
bodied
and
good
carbonation
normal
drinkability
i
could
have
had
another
and
maybe
even
another
after
that
poured
a
deep
orange
color
with
plenty
of
yeast
floating
about
the
head
was
disappointing
and
no
lacing
was
detected
this
sample
was
bottled
on
42706
the
smell
is
of
candi
sugar
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
addition
of
banana
bread
notes
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
wafers
there
is
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
harshness
towards
the
back
end
this
ale
is
well
carbonated
and
moderately
bodied
and
finishes
with
a
strange
bitterness
to
it
unlike
most
tripels
this
is
a
drinkable
tripel
not
the
best
i
have
had
the
first
american
version
i
have
had
drinkability
while
the
alcohol
is
relatively
high
it
is
well
masked
not
overwhelming
and
quite
enjoyable
bottle
courtesy
of
adrian910ss
poured
a
medium
golden
color
ale
with
a
small
white
bubbly
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
some
alcohol
taste
is
way
too
sweet
for
the
style
with
some
warming
alcohol
which
didnt
really
fit
in
there
body
was
about
average
with
some
medium
to
low
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
definitely
off
the
style
and
way
too
sweet
with
some
burning
alcohol
wavz
simple
triple
style
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
balanced
tripel
the
atringent
spice
flavor
found
in
most
of
the
american
brewed
tripels
is
not
present
here
the
malt
backbone
is
prevelant
and
balances
the
drink
nicely
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
this
is
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
but
at
9
youll
start
to
feel
it
pretty
quickly
stoudts
ale
isnt
going
to
quite
give
true
trappist
tripels
a
run
for
their
money
but
it
is
the
best
american
version
of
the
style
ive
tried
nice
i
like
it
this
beer
is
good
but
the
aroma
is
off
it
has
the
american
ale
aroma
when
belgian
yeasts
are
way
more
estery
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellowish
orange
color
nice
clean
white
head
that
dissipated
rather
quick
with
a
mild
lace
smell
is
very
fruity
and
floral
there
a
certain
hints
of
banana
and
caramel
in
the
nose
some
presence
of
pale
malt
and
a
strong
dough
like
yeast
scent
quite
a
complexity
of
fruit
tones
mixed
in
taste
is
smooth
and
mild
lots
of
banana
up
front
with
a
mild
tone
of
yeast
and
a
hop
mix
in
the
aftertaste
very
dough
like
hides
the
alcohol
rather
well
with
no
real
strong
over
powering
alcohol
flavor
very
enjoyable
with
lots
of
changing
flavors
tones
of
plum
and
raisin
mild
caramel
and
lots
of
other
essence
maybe
some
light
lemon
hints
quite
drinkable
but
still
can
take
some
getting
used
to
the
flavor
not
for
everyones
pallet
still
packs
quite
a
punch
form
the
abv
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
some
chunky
floaties
produces
a
thin
and
quickly
vanishing
head
no
lacing
at
all
pleasant
fruity
aromas
of
apricot
pear
green
apple
are
dominant
with
some
notes
of
spices
malts
and
banana
lingering
in
the
background
mouthfeel
was
disappointingly
flat
and
sticky
for
a
belgianstyle
triple
one
would
expect
a
much
more
lively
level
of
carbonation
for
this
style
flavor
was
quite
authentic
to
style
revealing
sweet
ripe
fruit
caramel
malt
spices
and
a
touch
of
pepper
lemon
juice
and
a
restrained
hop
bitterness
which
kept
the
sugary
sweetness
in
check
an
admirable
attempt
at
the
style
but
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
triple
id
prefer
the
real
deal
from
belgium
over
this
anyday
im
not
very
schooled
on
the
belguims
yet
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
most
likely
will
try
it
again
sometimes
these
get
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
to
drink
a
couple
but
man
they
sure
evoke
alot
of
unique
flavors
and
are
great
for
sipping
not
to
bad
overall
from
stoudts
solid
got
this
in
a
trade
a
while
ago
and
i
dont
know
who
sent
it
but
thanks
who
ever
you
are
poured
a
cloudy
tan
orange
with
a
small
light
tan
head
that
didnt
last
long
aroma
sour
fruits
spicy
yeast
flavor
cantaloupe
which
i
do
not
like
and
wont
eat
it
but
i
will
make
the
sacrifice
and
not
include
that
in
my
rating
and
finish
this
beer
got
some
orange
and
a
nice
sweetness
which
i
am
glad
of
because
of
the
aroma
being
so
sour
and
a
nice
alcohol
burn
yeast
and
some
nice
spices
got
the
glove
and
a
hint
if
lemon
not
to
bad
this
tripel
poured
a
hazy
reddish
amber
color
with
tan
foam
that
settled
to
a
thin
coat
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
malty
with
a
typical
but
light
belgian
tripel
aroma
there
was
a
slight
sweet
tanginess
in
the
smell
the
taste
was
belgian
and
malty
with
quite
a
pronounced
sweetness
almost
sugary
and
a
touch
of
tanginess
the
hops
were
moderate
the
mouthfeel
was
sweet
with
mediumfull
body
and
modes
carbonation
the
sweet
malty
flavor
lingered
this
was
an
ok
tripel
but
a
bit
overly
sweet
props
to

this

im
new
to
stoudts
beers
but
so
far
they
seem
like
a
winner
a
fine
american
example
of
the
belgian

a
solid
tripel
with
the
sharpness
at
the

being
the
main
drawback
to
not

still
quite

considering
the

the

will
keep
these
to

overall
a
very
delightful
americanbrewed
blegian
triple
d
spicier
pilsner
maltiness
is
a
little
less
featured
but
still
pretty
decent
id
put
it
in
the
affligem
sweetertripel
style
rather
than
the
drier
chimaywestmalle
even
then
its
not
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
taste
is
a
little
more
noticeable
than
i
would
like
scored
and
reviewed
verbatim
from
notes
pour
is
a
nice
golden
hazy
color
unfortunately
there
is
no
head
whatsoever
and
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
very
disappointing
however
the
smell
is
redeeminig
an
excellent
example
of
the
tripel
style
tart
fruity
cherry
and
apple
and
spicey
the
taste
seems
less
impressive
if
only
slightly
it
has
all
the
markings
of
a
great
tripel
very
spicey
cirtus
orange
with
a
pleasant
tinge
of
alcohol
but
it
is
unnecessarily
sour
at
the
end
i
think
overall
though
a
solid
beer
and
very
enjoyable
sipping
but
is
it
worth
the
price
only
you
can
decide
pours
to
a
hazy
copper
color
with
offwhite
head
that
lingers
through
midglass
and
leaves
good
lacing
initial
aroma
of
malt
and
dark
fruits
mostly
grapes
and
figs
flavor
at
first
is
spicy
fruit
with
malty
sweetness
as
beer
warms
at
midglass
alcohol
becomes
more
evident
in
both
the
aroam
and
the
taste
finish
leaves
a
sweet
syrupy
aftertaste
accompanied
by
an
alcoholinduced
warming
sensation
a
good
beer
for
sipping
one
but
definitely
not
a
session
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
a
bit
darker
than
i
expected
with
a
thick
tannish
head
smell
is
chock
full
of
spices
and
alcohol
taste
is
similar
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
hidden
very
well
and
it
has
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
fairly
malty
coates
the
mouth
very
well
drinkability
is
high
especially
given
the
alcohol
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
other
tastes
didnt
really
come
through
as
much
as
i
hoped
they
would
other
than
that
a
pretty
good
session
beer
this
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
big
head
there
is
also
an
interesting
swish
that
goes
on
when
its
poured
vigorously
the
smell
is
just
like
a
traditional
tripel
with
lots
of
spices
and
the
alcohol
just
peaking
through
the
taste
is
similar
starts
out
almost
like
sweet
juice
because
of
all
the
malt
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
this
beer
goes
down
really
easy
i
would
say
that
this
is
an
ideal
brew
if
you
are
not
used
to
the
strong
alcohol
taste
of
normal
tripels
but
it
really
doesnt
cut
it
if
you
are
looking
for
something
really
special
drinkability
i
had
a
pretty
good
buzz
after
just
a
pint
which
i
suppose
makes
sense
due
to
the
abv
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
id
sure
have
it
again
if
i
see
it
on
tap
havent
had
it
in
a
bottle
yet
though
either
this
beer
poured
a
dense
ambercopper
color
with
a
slight
white
head
that
ran
away
quickly
and
left
a
small
white
ring
around
the
edge
and
a
floating
island
in
the
middle
the
nose
of
the
beer
a
bit
citrusy
and
sugary
with
some
yeast
notes
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
cherry
tones
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
there
is
a
nice
alcohol
burn
on
the
tongue
at
the
end
rich
buttery
ripe
plum
coupled
with
a
heady
dose
of
alcohol
some
sweet
malts
present
midsip
lending
this
a
fairly
authentic
belgian
feel
the
high
abv
made
this
beer
work
for
me
i
think
without
the
extra
alcohol
kick
it
might
have
been
too
sweet
but
that
balanced
it
out
very
well
no
real
head
forms
but
reveals
a
gorgeous
orangeruby
grapefruit
coloured
appearance
very
nice
looking
a
candyesque
bubblegum
nose
both
sticky
and
sweet
aroma
spicy
and
intoxicating
letting
its
strength
and
contents
known
mouthfeel
with
a
light
burn
and
a
light
peppery
note
very
authentic
tasting
the
burning
would
come
to
agree
quite
well
with
me
it
was
short
lived
but
with
every
sip
this
one
is
potent
what
a
dense
mouthfeel
for
this
style
once
again
lets
its
strength
and
contents
known
a
little
fruity
zest
that
took
some
time
to
show
itself
letting
this
one
warm
helped
compliment
it
thanks
to
harry
for
sharing
both
his
company
and
his
bottle
for
this
sitting
md
definitely
has
a
warming
effect
high
carbonation
medium
bodied
pretty
ok
overall
this
poured
an
orangeyamber
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
my
duvel
chalice
but
it
quickly
fell
the
smell
is
a
quite
nice
combo
of
fruits
a
whif
of
banana
and
yeast
wow
what
a
great
tasting
ale
and
spot
on
for
style
the
finish
is
suprisingly
smooth
with
candi
sugar
providing
a
sweet
and
mellow
ending
good
mouthfeel
and
decent
drinkability
even
though
this
weighs
in
at
9
where
did
they
hide
it
a
decent
brew
but
pretty
unbalanced
and
with
alchohol
presence
is
a
bit
rough
not
a
bad
drink
but
not
by
any
means
the
first
tripel
id
reach
for
very
little
head
but
otherwise
nice
appearance
kind
of
goldenamber
and
fairly
clear
aroma
is
awesome
has
hints
of
rose
clover
honey
and
a
winelike
light
citrus
character
the
flavor
is
very
good
too
starts
kind
of
dry
and
acidic
with
a
slight
spiciness
but
it
doesnt
finish
very
dry
at
all
with
hints
of
candy
golden
malt
and
cookielike
character
along
with
some
more
spiciness
and
a
light
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
spritzy
and
overall
its
a
pleasant
drink
that
would
go
well
in
the
deep
winter
as
well
as
on
a
hot
humid
tennessee
day
in
moderation
of
course
special
thanks
goes
to
bill
n
for
buying
me
this
one
d
moderate
drinkability
kinda
oversweet
it
looks
and
smells
good
hinting
at
a
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
like
the
description
says
it
should
be
taste
is
pretty
good
certainly
malty
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
get
a
yeasty
taste
in
this
another
mention
the
book
says
to
look
out
for
there
are
flavors
here
ive
never
tasted
so
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
them
little
to
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
which
raises
this
in
my
eyes
loses
something
as
it
warms
drinkability
is
average
since
i
dont
see
this
as
a
beer
you
can
break
out
at
any
given
time
certainly
a
mood
beer
probably
a
beer
you
have
one
of
and
then
move
on
to
something
else
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
syrup
like
not
bad
just
a
little
sticky
its
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
due
to
its
abv
and
the
fact
that
you
have
to
stick
it
in
a
cellar
for
a
year
to
get
this
result
still
a
little
hot
and
green
when
fresh
but
much
better
with
a
little
patience
quite
nice
the
current
version
is
certainly
less
yeasty
than
it
used
to
be
and
it
seems
a
little
lighter
in
the
flavor
with
fewer
kilned
malts
the
alcohol
could
be
subdued
some
as
well
but
i
think
that
hinders
the
head
retention
more
than
it
does
the
flavor
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
have
to
say
ive
never
tasted
anything
quite
like
this
the
combination
of
medicinal
bitterness
burnt
rubber
burnt
orange
peel
bananas
and
roasted
wheat
husk
all
contribute
to
a
very
odd
but
enjoyable
brew
as
far
as
triples
go
its
far
from
the
style
as
far
as
beer
goes
its
pretty
damn
good
a
sipper
caramel
colored
small
head
remains
alcohol
sugar
fruit
on
the
nose
molasses
sugar
plums
great
taste
mouthfeel
is
substantial
syrupy
the
taste
is
very
candylike
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
high
alcohol
content
this
is
a
definite
sipper
that
is
worth
a
try
a
drinkable
beer
yes
but
far
from
a
great
one
lots
of
things
about
this
beer
are
off
for
the
style
it
is
a
bit
too
hopped
up
and
dark
for
the
style
the
hops
are
astringent
in
a
beer
style
not
noted
for
that
mouthfeel
is
average
at
best
i
just
cant
see
myself
buying
this
wherever
i
can
get
a
st
bernardus
triple
bottle
dated
21806
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
looks
very
much
like
unfiltered
apple
juice
mild
carbonation
with
tons
of
small
particles
suspended
in
the
glass
im
assuming
that
its
yeast
sediment
this
being
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
some
candi
sugar
perhaps
taste
is
fruity
as
well
hints
of
apple
orange
peel
and
surprisingly
peach
the
alcohol
is
fairly
noticeable
on
the
swallow
not
overwhelming
but
it
makes
its
presence
felt
enough
to
take
a
little
off
the
drinkability
factor
average
mouthfeel
overall
a
nice
warming
sipper
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
very
soon
pleasant
but
not
standout
when
a
beers
this
big
alcoholwise
im
looking
for
something
a
bit
more
special
the
booziness
of
this
beer
in
its
current
state
is
a
put
off
maybe
some
time
in
the
cellar
can
fix
that
i
really
liked
the
nose
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
very
little
head
it
smells
a
bit
fruity
the
taste
is
definitely
in
line
with
the
style
theres
no
doubt
this
is
a
bottle
conditioned
trippel
but
yet
something
seems
a
bit
lacking
compared
to
the
belgian
trippels
ive
had
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
whats
lacking
and
actually
this
beer
seems
to
be
growing
on
me
definitely
worth
a
try
but
im
still
kind
of
up
in
the
air
on
what
i
think
about
this
one
i
think
i
might
need
a
couple
more
to
really
decide
beer
is
good
happy
local
tripel
beering
drinkable
why
not
im
not
driving
big
powerful
flavors
in
this
one
very
pronounced
alcohol
spicy
white
pepper
paprika
etc
caramel
and
molssess
in
the
malt
nice
drying
hoppiness
inthe
finish
quite
sticky
mouth
though
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
a
sipper
for
sure
but
a
damn
interesting
one
this
was
a
pretty
good
triple
at
9
a
six
i
cannot
complain
either
very
fruity
nice
carbonation
and
sweet
finish
in
true
belgian
style
not
overly
yeasty
tangerine
type
texture
to
it
very
drinkable
and
very
high
alcohol
content
nothing
offensive
about
this
one
ive
now
had
2
stoudts
beers
and
theyve
both
been
excellent
poured
an
attractive
orangeamber
color
with
only
modest
white
head
that
quickly
fell
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
a
nice
combination
of
summer
fruits
bananas
and
yeast
taste
is
truly
enjoyable
with
the
summer
fruitiness
and
yeast
joing
together
to
create
a
pleasureable
drink
finish
is
extremely
smooth
with
the
candi
sugar
gining
a
pleasnt
sweet
ending
hard
to
believe
this
was
9
alcohol
until
i
checked
my
spelling
in
this
review
i
think
its
a
nice
conservative
example
of
this
style
that
gives
a
goog
interpretation
without
becoming
too
extreme
pours
dark
brown
caramel
with
not
much
head
only
a
smidgen
of
carbonation
moderate
lacing
they
put
it
in
a
pint
glass
for
me
though
was
a
little
offended
nose
is
rather
lacking
raisiny
bready
malty
taste
is
also
a
bit
less
than
i
expected
its
good
that
you
dont
taste
the
alcohol
but
the
rest
is
all
just
toned
down
as
well
sugary
fruits
raisins
etc
malts
all
proper
components
there
balance
was
a
bit
off
as
well
too
sweet
and
grainy
overall
i
was
not
so
impressed
but
i
think
that
it
was
partially
due
to
the
wrong
glassware
id
love
to
taste
this
tripel
next
to
the
aged
white
cheddar
hollingsheads
deli
in
orange
pours
a
onefinger
cream
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
and
leaves
no
lace
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
color
is
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
nose
alcohol
and
raisins
starts
sweet
nice
raisiny
flavor
finish
is
warming
but
the
high
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
2
49
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
nice
beer
im
not
so
big
on
style
guidelines
as
i
am
on
enjoyment
so
maybe
i
ranked
the
taste
too
high
like
the
man
said
i
dont
know
much
about
art
but
this
one
had
to
convince
me
it
was
worthy
and
it
did
ill
buy
some
more
if
i
see
it
tripel
may
just
be
my
favorite
of
the
traditional
belgian
styles
ive
had
several
excellent
versions
lately
and
have
been
blown
away
by
their
combination
of
power
and
complexity
unfortunately
stoudts
triple
doesnt
measure
up
it
would
have
been
nice
to
see
what
it
would
have
tasted
like
with
a
few
more
years
of
hopefully
mellowing
rest
under
its
belt
too
bad
that
i
chose
to
open
my
one
and
only
bottle
today
appears
deep
bronze
honey
color
thin
white
head
leaves
absolutely
no
lacing
down
the
chalice
seems
way
undercarbonated
smells
very
sweet
and
boozy
at
this
point
i
was
used
to
trying
stoudts
triple
when
it
was
effervescent
and
a
bit
more
refined
some
heavy
tropical
fruit
soaked
in
alcohol
tones
coming
through
mild
touch
of
hops
evident
tastes
vinous
deep
rich
maltiness
some
evident
bitterness
lacks
dimensions
of
a
great
triple
style
ale
seems
to
be
fruity
sweet
with
alcohol
and
mild
hops
not
enough
layers
for
me
have
any
belgian
tripel
over
this
brew
texture
was
syrupy
really
needs
some
work
in
my
opinion
i
hope
this
one
is
better
in
the
twelve
oz
bottles
drinkability
for
me
was
a
bit
cloying
low
carbonation
needs
to
have
some
spritziness
to
it
alcohol
really
came
out
in
the
flavor
d
i
dont
know
what
to
think
when
i
first
had
this
beer
it
was
delicious
sweet
and
fragrant
now
it
something
completely
different
a
real
disappointment
i
guess
that
must
have
just
been
a
better
batch
or
maybe
a
lot
fresher
but
i
really
dont
want
another
cheers
an
amber
colored
beer
with
an
offwhite
colored
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of
bananas
tropical
fruit
caramel
and
alcohol
seem
to
come
out
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
strong
sugar
presence
that
is
closely
followed
by
a
juicy
bitterness
leaves
behind
a
sweet
aftertaste
that
is
enjoyable
yey
another
excellent
beer
from
stoudts
overall
decent
triple
that
hides
the
alcohol
up
front
but
it
comes
back
with
a
vengance
burning
the
throat
sweet
and
not
as
harsh
as
you
would
seem
decent
wouldnt
turn
1
down
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
and
medium
bodied
a
bit
thicker
than
i
expected
but
it
still
flows
down
fairly
smoothly
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
tripel
but
it
just
didnt
grab
me
enough
to
make
me
want
to
seek
it
out
again
anytime
soon
worth
a
try
a
pretty
unsuccessful
tripel
that
smells
better
than
it
tastes
flavor
wholly
overwhelmed
by
alcohol
overall
i
think
this
one
deserves
to
be
ranked
higher
than
it
is
purely
on
potential
there
are
complex
aromas
and
flavors
in
there
but
theyre
just
crushed
by
the
alcohol
presence
i
took
this
into
account
and
therefore
the
drinkability
took
more
of
a
hit
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
to
lay
down
but
i
think
the
alcohol
may
already
be
too
much
close
to
being
great
though
i
could
definitely
deal
with
more
of
this
cloudy
orange
in
color
with
a
ok
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
no
lacing
spicey
clove
smell
with
a
hint
of
banana
and
alcohol
spiciness
really
stands
out
in
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
alcohol
comes
through
farther
down
the
glass
initially
comes
across
as
very
complex
but
as
you
drink
more
it
becomes
kind
of
one
dimensional
an
ok
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
but
not
one
that
i
will
chase
after
uf
this
is
a
good
beer
ive
certainly
had
better
tripels
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
it
could
use
more
funk
more
carbonation
and
generally
more
complexity
recommended
drinkability
easy
drinking
as
is
the
norm
id
hesitate
getting
this
on
tap
again
though
i
recall
enjoying
it
in
the
bottle
bottled
on
121204
a
nice
interpretation
of
this
style
maybe
a
tad
sweet
which
lends
itself
to
not
being
so
well
balanced
carbonation
is
rather
sharp
on
the
sip
but
this
fullbodied
ale
really
gets
nice
and
creamy
i
could
drink
this
a
whole
lot
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
slight
carbonation
bite
i
would
prefer
a
less
cloying
version
something
with
more
dry
balance
a
good
tripel
but
lacks
the
depth
to
be
great
cellaring
may
improve
that
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisp
yet
smooth
most
of
the
characteristics
remain
but
the
alcohol
definately
calmed
over
the
last
four
months
in
my
cellar
the
alcohol
burn
is
still
in
the
stomach
and
on
the
tongue
though
not
as
present

the
nose

drunkability

alcoholics
and

will
appreciate
this

of

but
most
aficionados
of
the
style
will
cry
foul
for
all
those
people
who
say
they
have
to
lay
off
beer
for
a

days
because
they

delicious
drinkable
and

for
something
that
looks
like
burnt

i
dont
expect
much
from
stoudts
but
this
is
certainly
a
tripel
id
come
back
to
marginal

smooth

well

also

some

kicked
in
prematurely
but
a
good
sleep
on
a
hot
summer
night
a
good
effort
this
is
a
milyorange
brew
with
a
modest
white
head
it
presents
a
yeasty
slightly
tart
aroma
with
a
bit
of
yeast
in
the
background
theres
a
little
tart
citrusyreminiscent
fruit
in
the
smell
as
well
fleeting
phenols
and
a
distant
funky
aroma
are
also
thrown
in
the
mix
its
not
a
very
sweet
brew
but
instead
presents
an
almost
medicinal
flavor
slightly
harsh
and
notably
alcoholic
in
taste
its
got
a
nice
heavy
body
with
a
moderate
to
low
carbonation
and
a
solid
hop
finish
all
in
all
i
really
expected
more
from
this
brewery
the
beers
good
qualities
are
not
folded
into
the
experience
and
the
unfavorable
ones
are
too
pronounced
i
really
appreciate
the
drinkabilty
and
how
the
brew
is
satisfyingly
full
and
smooth
it
just
doesnt
come
together
as
a
singularly
flavorful
and
complex
beer
finger

skipped

to

along
with

topped
with

good
choice
on
my
part
if
i
do
say
so
myself
a
noble
attempt
at
the
style
and
a
drinkable
drink
but
nothing
to
jump
up
and
whoop
about
really
keep
on
trying
needs
something
more
elevating
more
ethereal
more
unexpected
to
really
rank
as
a
tripel
with
considered
attention
to
the
pour
a
good
film
of
multisized
bubbles
covers
the
offering
and
has
a
medium
stick
throughout
the

makes
it

belgianstyle
ale

very
very
nice
excellent
drink
with
which
to
start
a
night
of
boozing
or
to
have
after
dinner
to
my
taste
a
sip
of
this
beer
brings
on
many
of
the
tastes
of
a
tripel

plenty
of
yeastiness
clove
spice
and
banana
backed
up
by
a
weak
hop
background
the
alcohol
taste
is
quite
prevalent
and
the
hop
characteristic
is
simply
a
background
player
this
causes
a
bit
of
unbalance
but
nothing
horrible
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
a
syrupy
thickness
combined
with
spot
on
effervescence
12
ouncer
sampled
wo
any
freshness
dating
to
be
found
pours
a
cloudy
orangy
light
amber
minimal
white
head
and
minor
lacing
left
on
the
glass
strong
nose
of
alcohol
paint
thinner
this
one
is
a
fairly
nasty
brew
with
overpowering
notes
of
hot
alcohol
heavy
thick
bodied
not
very
pleasant
stuff
a
healthy
dose
of
nutty
yeast
on
the
botom
of
the
bottle
did
add
a
softer
layer
to
the
finish
for
a
tripel
lover
this
was
quite
a
let
down
obviously
finer
tripels
are
out
there
it
came
served
in
a
chimay
goblet
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
that
slowly
subsided
leaving
behind
a
wispy
head
in
its
wake
it
had
a
very
sweet
nose
it
was
a
clear
light
amber
liquid
without
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
evidence
it
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
very
sweet
finish
had
i
had
more
time
i
would
certainly
have
ordered
another
edit
now
that
some
of
the
co2
has
faded
it
is
cloying
this
triple
has
moved
from
not
bad
to
bad
in
a
hurry
looks
like
a
dumper
if
you
are
going
to
try
this
beer
drink
it
quickly
definately
one
of
the
more
interesting
looking
brews
i
have
seen
before
it
was
a
cloudy
cream
color
with
a
white
head
the
beer
was
so
cloudy
i
couldnt
see
through
it
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
lasted
only
a
short
a
while
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
when
compared
to
other
triples
ive
had
it
was
also
a
little
too
strong
in
the
alcohol
department
overall
an
interesting
brew
id
like
to
see
how
this
one
would
do
after
being
set
aside
for
a
short
while
not
all
that
bad
but
this
tripel
seems
to
lack
some
balance
thus
the
alcohol
is
allowed
to
be
the
more
dominant
character
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
hop
character
and
dryness
less
sweetness
and
a
sneaking
alcohol
poured
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
quickly
fell
and
left
some
lacing
the
smell
was
of
belgian
candi
sugar
and
some
spices
the
taste
was
of
candy
oranges
spices
and
a
touch
of
alcoholic
warming
and
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
fairly
complex
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
more
of
this
poured
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
puffy
white
head
very
striking
color
the
nose
had
a
wonderful
fruity
character
full
of
juicy
peach
and
orange
peel
citrus
with
a
sweet
syrupy
undertone
the
flavor
was
tart
and
flavorful
with
a
nice
yeasty
baked
note
coupled
with
a
warming
alcohol
distinction
and
a
creamsicle
finish
nice
zesty
mouthfeel
another
big
beer
from
stoudts
that
impressed
me
drinkability
i
like
this
example
it
seems
to
have
an
aire
about
it
that
makes
it
special
and
perhaps
even
different
than
any
other
beer
out
there
it
certainly
doesnt
compare
to
the
belgians
but
it
does
offer
up
a
nice
spin
on
this
classic
style
of
beer
id
be
interested
to
see
how
these
age
especially
with
the
huge
amount
of
sludge
put
in
to
conjure
the
bottle
conditioning
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
very
satisfying
as
if
made
for
a
chill
evening
one
note
when
i
poured
the
12
i
let
in
the
bottle
down
the
sink
it
oozed
out
and
was
the
color
of
a
cappucino
quite
the
yeastbeast
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
leaves
little
lacing
anywhere
on
the
nose
it
is
initally
malts
with
fruit
background
a
tiny
trace
of
hops
come
through
quite
a
sniffer
tastes
fruity
as
can
be
with
a
very
tart
citrus
appeal
a
little
too
tart
on
the
finish
though
not
as
well
rounded
as
the
750ml
version
feels
too
carbonated
and
light
in
the
mouth
just
an
average
mouthfeel
though
not
too
bad
needs
to
be
a
bit
chewier
when
its
all
said
and
done
this
is
a
very
solid
tripel
the
750ml
version
is
a
little
better
as
for
most
of
stoudts
beers
its
a
consistent
and
very
good
beer
but
again
as
with
all
stoudts
beers
its
nothing
unique
or
spectacular
try
it
anyways
youll
probably
like
it
12
oz
bottle
poured
out
a
nice
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
stiff
white
head
the
smell
was
malty
and
sweet
the
taste
was
good
very
bready
with
a
banana
like
taste
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
taste
hops
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
rich
but
not
thick
and
well
carbonated
the
drinkability
was
good
smelled
of
sweet
malt
and
wheat
i
would
describe
the
color
as
a
lighter
shade
of
pumpkin
which
was
topped
off
by
a
bright
white
head
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
with
tight
abrasive
bubbles
taste
was
complex
and
spicy
with
sugary
notes
of
banana
as
well
as
a
surpising
hop
bitterness
not
a
very
unique
interpretation
of
the
style
but
a
solid
representation
not
outstanding
but
pretty
good
this
one
is
another
very
nice
belgian
beer
that
goes
down
a
treat
the
beer
is
quite
fruity
and
lively
with
an
excellent
balance
but
perhaps
falls
just
short
of
being
a
classic
only
just
though
and
thats
probably
just
because
some
of
the
other
abbey
tripels
ive
tried
have
set
the
bar
so
high
i
definitely
liked
this
one
more
than
i
thought
i
would
but
again
sadly
its
probably
not
one
id
pick
up
again
unless
i
stumbled
across
in
a
bar
which
is
quite
unlikely
as
it
stands
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
brews
i
loved
it
the
first
time
i
had
it
20
years
ago
and
i
still
love
it
now
not
as
heavy
as
many
belgium
dark
beers
but
still
very
complex
very
light
pale
yellow
in
color
forms
a
large
foamy
but
stable
white
head
lots
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
aroma
is
somewhat
subdued
but
what
is
there
is
standard
for
the
style
mostly
yeastily
phenols
mixed
with
a
light
sweetness
and
some
floral
citrus
taste
is
likewise
typical
for
the
style
most
yeasty
phenols
a
touch
of
bandaid
moderate
sweetness
and
some
orangey
citrus
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
mild
bitterness
a
nice
tasting
beer
but
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
taste

on
tap

authority
nyc
this
is
one
helluva
beer
very
smooth
light
and
yes
ill
say
it
sophisticated
it
has
so
much
character
it
should
be
appreciated
year
round
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
i
will
order
whenever
and
wherever
i
see
it
and
so
considerate
at
only
7
5
abv
this
was
one
of
the
first
tripels
that
i
had
and
i
was
impressed
by
the
depth
of
flavor
the
aroma
was
fragrant
and
full
of
delightful
spice
as
was
the
beer
itself
the
mouthfeel
was
one
of
the
best
parts
nice
carbonation
and
fullbodied
without
seeming
dense
or
heavy
words
i
would
use
include
spicy
and
nutty
with
a
lovely
long
finish
and
little
bitterness
or
sourness
to
speak
of
i
have
not
had
many
tripels
yet
but
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
was
interested
in
a
moderately
complex
and
tasty
sipping
beer
would
certainly
buy
again
while
i
do
think
the
nose
is
deficient
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
tripels
out
there
nothing
overwhelmingly
fancy
but
exceptionally
wellmade
arguably
a
good
entry
point
into
the
style
actually
due
to
its
intrinsic
competency
tripel
pale
and
golden
with
a
lively
white
head
hints
of
light
fruits
some
pears
white
grapes
orange
peels
and
a
touch
of
yeasty
bread
a
bit
of
clove
as
well
very
classic
belgian
pale
ale
and
tripel
flavor
goes
well
with
a
flaky
white
fleshed
fish
with
butter
and
rosemary
effervescent
and
light
this
beer
makes
for
a
nice
compliment
with
dinner
big
yeast
funk
spice
orange
slice
everything
nice
solid
tripel
loads
of
carbonation
making
for
fun
excess
swirling
cool
bottle
at
first
it
seems
less
tinted
but
its
just
lack
of
a
paper
label
lets
some
more
light
in
but
at
least
it
isnt
a
green
bottle
look
forward
to
more
from
this
brouwerij
this
is
close
to
westmalle
but
it
doesnt
pack
the
same
punch
overall
drinkability
a
definite
sipping
beer
but
i
wish
i
had
a
larger
bottle
so
good
marks
for
drinkability
good
with
a
meal
fish
and
green
beans
but
i
think
it
would
hold
up
all
on
its
own
although
i
think
it
would
always
be
better
with
some
food
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
a
beer
like
this
seems
best
with
food
by
itself
it
does
quite
well
but
i
think
more
of
the
flavors
are
notable
with
food
to
contrast
against
a
solidly
outstanding
beer
brouwerij
corsendonk
superb
brew
with
some
good
live
yeast
in
the
bottle
i
could
see
this
doing
well
as
a
cellar
beer
and
i
will
be
picking
up
another
bottle
belgium
does
make
some
fine
beers
and
there
are
plenty
of
american
brews
up
to
the
task
of
taking
them
on
in
their
own
game
overall
an
ok
tripel
but
far
from
great
a
little
too
much
spice
and
malt
and
not
dry
enough
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
overall
good
beer
with
some
inclinations
toward
being
a
really
good
beer
very
good
representation
of
the
style
which
i
believe
could
also
be
a
good
introduction
definitely
worth
a
try
o
highly
spiced
not
my
cup
of
tea
allthough
i
wouldnt
throw
it
out
crisp
but
not
sharp
like
most
belgium
beers
great
very
light
taste
of
apples
and
crisp
fruits
its
a
delicious
beer
that
goes
down
easily
thats
what
she
said
no
she
did
my
wife
enjoyed
this
one
as

this
one
up

this

and
the

was
a
nice
elegant
touch
overall
not
my
favourite
mix

but
a
very
solid
beer
for

this
would
work
well

very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
tripel
style
all
around
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
yeast
and
moderate
hop
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
spice
and
floral
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
floral
presence
that
comes
through
especially
well
in
the
aroma
o
hoppy
for
a
tripel
maybe
not
the
most
complex
of
the
style
but
its
very
drinkable
theres
a
lot
to
love
about
it
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
worth
trying
but
a
little
too
dry
for
my
preferences
if
you
get
it
bottled
definitely
worth
trying
both
with
yeast
left
out
and
then
added
in
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
this
is
a
good
tripel
but
not
as
good
as
westmalle
trappist
tripel
pairs
well
with
aged
white
cheddar
figs
and
black
grapesand
of
course
toast
crackers
o
this
is
enjoyable
but
noticeably
less
complex
and
enjoyable
than
something
like
la
fin
du
monde
im
still
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
though
o
a
nice
tripel
perhaps
on
the
more
sour
side
but
still
i
like
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
super
smooth
light
and
fruity
the
flavors
really
pop
on
this
one
if
i
am
looking
for
a
beer
in
this
style
this
would
be
near
the
top
of
my
list
o
pleasant
and
subtle
but
imperfect
loses
steam
as
it
warms
and
the
wateriness
becomes
apparent
the
clear
loser
to
guldenberg
in
the
headtohead
though
i
now
realize
thats
a
poor
pairing
o
impressive
tripel
great
flavors
and
aromas
quite
enjoyable
in
my
book
a
tripel
that
i
can
always
come
back
to
o
a
solid
tripel
overall
with
a
good
balance
of
flavors
not
quite
as
complex
as
some
of
the
best
but
a
good
beer
overall
o
overall
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
exceptionally
good
either
i
dont
know
how
fresh
this
beer
is
but
it
isnt
the
best
tasting
tripel
it
has
a
very
nice
presence
in
the
mouth
but
is
extremely
lacking
in
flavor
and
the
scent
leaves
much
to
be
desired
lots
of
carbonation
make
this
beer
very
light
it
goes
down
very
easy
definitely
a
beer
to
look
for
again
thanks
to
joe
p
for
giving
this
bottle
a
very
solid
beer
not
overly
special
but
worth
a
try
nonetheless
o
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
rather
easy
to
drink
especially
when
compared
to
other
tripels
d
an
alright
beer
for
sure
but
in
belgium
this
beer
is
more
middlin
than
amazing
good
not
great
rjt
o
a
nice
floral
drinkable
belgian
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
a
solid
easydrinking
beer
very
tasty
tripel
enjoyed
at
55
degrees
and
it
was
perfect
for
the
texture
aroma
is
somewhat
soapy
which
is
a
bit
unbecoming
the
flavor
is
a
malty
and
just
enough
belgian
yeast
character
to
make
you
notice
i
like
it
and
would
give
it
an
overall
award
of
4
out
of
5
opens
with
a
loud
pop
definitely
some
carbonation
in
this
one
pours
clear
light
golden
with
a
head
of
mixed
foam
and
larger
bubbles
aroma
is
light
yeast
notes
and
a
hint
of
green
pepper
kinda
strange
in
the
mouth
theres
lightly
toasted
malt
mild
sweetness
and
fruitiness
and
a
noticeable
alcohol
flavor
highly
carbonated
with
minimal
linger
something
of
a
boring
tripel
easy
to
drink
but
pretty
low
on
flavor
or
aroma
strangely
tastes
of
ginger
thankfully
im
having
this
beer
with
sushi
subtle
sweetness
lightly
floral
dried
fruit
flavors
of
apple
and
pear
finishes
spicy
and
dry
with
a
ginger
snap
i
like
it
but
it
begs
to
be
paired
wig
sushi
o
probably
a
good
one
to
have
on
hand
if
your
a
fan
of
belgians
i
personally
will
likely
get
this
beer
again
i
got
a
four
pack
and
they
recommended
aging
it
so
ill
save
the
other
bottles
to
see
if
they
really
do
get
more
complex
as
they
age
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
golden
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
plenty
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
and
side
of
the
glass
upon
the
initial
pour
there
are
aromas
of
bready
malt
and
yeast
i
also
pick
up
some
hops
in
the
smell
the
malt
profile
is
very
forward
in
this
beer
it
is
bready
and
sweet
the
hops
provide
some
balance
on
the
back
end
theres
a
touch
of
spiciness
as
well
the
sweetness
really
opens
up
as
it
warms
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
solid
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
high
for
this
sipper
this
is
a
very
good
beer
reminds
me
of
a
more
substantial
achel
very
typical
tripel
no
suprises
here
i
have
not
managed
to
buy
corsendonk
agnus
as
yet
in
the
uk
but
make
sure
that
i
always
stock
up
when
i
am
anywhere
near
belgium
i
would
welcome
an
english
supplier
o
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
for
a
belgian
tripel
i
expect
ally
more
and
this
one
certainly
wasnt
quite
up
to
par
with
the
other
tripels
overall
a
tripel
that
is
not
overpowered
by
any
one
flavor
on
the
contrary
the
blending
of
flavors
in
this
brew
is
exquisitely
done
overall
great
beer
had
it
a
few
years
back
on
tap
picked
up
a
glass
to
let
you
know
what
youre
missing
might
be
a
little
sweet
but
not
in
the
soda
type
of
way
complex
but
smooth
salud
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
and
above
average
example
of
an
authentic
belgian
tripel
it
had
all
the
key
things
that
i
look
for
in
a
good
example
of
this
style
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
went
down
really
smooth
the
alcohol
hardly
showed
up
in
the
flavor
and
it
had
more
then
enough
good
flavors
to
hold
my
attention
this
is
going
down
quicker
then
i
thought
one
of
the
most
drinkable
tripels
i
have
had
i
dont
think
i
would
have
a
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
by
myself
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
everything
all
aspects
of
this
beer
came
out
just
the
way
they
should
and
there
was
nothing
off
about
this
beer
a
very
well
rounded
beer
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
i
have
never
seen
it
around
here
we
get
a
good
variety
of
belgian
imports
in
this
part
of
michigan
and
i
am
surprised
that
i
dont
see
this
on
the
shelf
next
to
the
other
awesome
belgian
beers
whats
the
deal
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
good
tripel
it
provided
just
what
i
want
form
this
style
but
since
i
cant
find
it
around
here
who
knows
when
i
will
be
able
to
try
this
beer
again
i
know
if
i
did
see
it
again
i
wouldnt
buy
just
one
bottle
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
if
you
want
to
know
what
an
authentic
belgian
tripel
tastes
like
try
this
beer
and
you
should
get
a
good
idea
on
what
this
style
is
all
about
this
beer
made
for
a
pretty
good
first
impression
from
corsendonk
they
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
and
you
can
be
sure
that
i
will
try
more
of
their
beers
if
given
a
chance
this
beer
is
a
straight
up
good
tripel
no
doubt
about
it
i
am
very
happy
to
be
drinking
this
beer
on
my
400th
review
it
made
for
a
great
celebratory
beer
and
a
fun
beer
to
review
with
more
great
beers
like
this
just
waiting
for
me
to
try
them
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
the
next
400
new
beers
has
in
store
for
me
o
great
belgian
triple
smooth
and
drinkable
o
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
tripel
the
flavor
is
light
and
crisp
and
relatively
straightforward
a
nice
change
if
youre
looking
for
a
tripel
thats
a
little
different
overall
a
supereasy
drinking
tripel
on
the
lighter
side
of
things
i
wish
it
came
in
at
a
lower
pricepoint
this
beer
completes
me
i
love
this
beer
the
appearance
is
incredible
golden
and
cloudy
with
yeast
still
floating
in
the
beer
the
head
is
thick
white
lasts
a
long
time
and
leaves
lacing
at
each
level
you
drink
the
aroma
is
sweet
sugar
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
sublime
with
a
hi
of
fruitiness
that
smoothly
transitions
into
a
slight
bitter
bite
that
is
just
enough
to
cleanse
the
pallet
before
your
next
drink
this
also
leads
to
it
being
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
one
that
is
strong
enough
at
7
5
alc
to
make
its
presence
known
but
doesnt
sneak
up
on
you
i
honestly
think
this
may
be
my
absolute
favorite
beer
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
plenty
of
times
before
and
many
more
in
the
future
a
very
nice
tripel
indeed
and
happy
i
was
able
to
score
a
few
of
these
in
the
past
month
great
traditional
tripel
character
offered
in
this
tasty
brew
with
tons
to
offer
the
senses
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
brew
has
a
clean
crisp
yellow
wheat
color
with
a
full
2
finger
white
head
the
carbonation
was
very
active
but
once
settled
the
brew
was
quite
clear
the
aroma
was
quite
sweet
with
hints
of
plum
banana
and
some
alcohol
as
well
the
taste
was
dry
and
sweet
there
is
banana
grapes
and
very
light
malt
notes
alcohol
is
present
in
the
dry
finish
the
carbonation
makes
the
flavors
pop
and
this
brew
is
quite
refreshing
impressive
a
quality
brew
its
light
yet
fullbodied
and
dry
good
hop
aroma
despite
the
age
of
the
bottle
slightly
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
tasty
tripel
thats
well
worth
your
time
overall
a
great
tasting
tripel
o
i
really
like
this
beer
could
be
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
o
overall
a
good
tripel
its
a
little
bland
on
the
flavor
with
the
yeast
dominating
a
bit
too
much
still
it
smells
good
and
has
a
great
feel
to
it
a
little
bit
lighter
in
terms
of
flavor
that
what
i
had
expected
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
but
a
bit
lacking
in
overall
punch
well
worthy
of
another
and
another
though
highly
drinkable
triple
that
is
very
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
was
great
i
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
o
a
good
tripel
one
of
the
very
few
ive
had
i
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
good
tripel
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
one
ill
keep
coming
back
to
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
muddy
looking
golden
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
head
settles
a
little
bit
but
keep
a
white
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
some
soft
belgian
yeast
aromas
some
bread
and
grains
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
had
a
good
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
good
softness
to
it
overall
its
good
brew
once
it
warms
up
a
bit
obelgian
aletripelfruits
that
cant
be
bad
cheers
overalla
nice
beer
seems
more
a
tripel
than
a
pale
but
who
cares
im
interested
in
the
beer
and
this
one
hit
its
mark
worth
a
try
a
good
tasting
beer
sweet
and
spicy
malts
some
orange
peel
and
corrinder
finishes
dry
and
spicy
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
spicy
upfront
character
followed
by
dry
bitter
finish
that
clean
a
good
well
made
brew
it
tends
to
be
lighter
and
not
very
complex
which
i
think
works
in
its
favor
overall
extremely
nice
beer
will
be
having
again
if
i
can
find
it
overall
im
disappointed
with
this
one
belgium
is
my
land
of
beer
and
this
was
not
up
to
par
just
average
compared
to
the
others
ive
had
overall
it
stayes
one
of
my
favorites
not
the
most
complex
but
so
nice
a
great
triple
highly
recommended
selfhatinghipster
com
very
dense
head
that
holds
for
a
while
but
leaves
no
lace
when
it
fades
hazy
pale
golden
colour
smell
of
spices
clove
mango
most
of
all
citrus
banana
it
feels
dry
on
the
palate
fuzzy
taste
is
the
same
of
smell
only
more
citrus
in
this
case
orange
peel
dominating
bitter
finish
d
highly
drinkable
pleasant
beer
for
a
nice
summer
day
i
enjoyed
this
one
thebeeralmanac
com
this
was
a
2007
bottle
had
already
peaked
must
try
a
younger
better
stored
one
pours
a
nice
golden
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
white
fluffy
lasting
head
aroma
has
a
nice
citrusy
hops
with
lemon
and
orange
peel
fruity
notes
taste
is
a
nice
sweet
citrusy
hops
lemon
and
orange
peel
with
some
nice
malt
and
yeast
nice
lively
carbonation
and
nice
medium
body
with
a
nice
crisp
mouth
feel
on
the
palate
finish
is
sweet
citrusy
hops
with
some
lemony
orange
peel
some
light
grapefruit
and
pineapple
notes
ending
with
a
nice
yeasty
malty
character
overall
a
very
good
flavorful
crisp
and
refreshing
brew
i
would
drink
this
again
very
nice
hazy
light
amber
body
with
3
finger
head
medium
sized
bubbles
not
getting
much
on
the
nose
maybe
some
coriander
and
yeast
very
spicy
on
the
tongue
and
as
it
warms
i
get
more
of
the
bright
fruity
flavor
banana
orange
a
bit
of
lime
perhaps
the
yeast
is
also
apparent
adding
that
nice
bready
quality
the
beer
is
a
bit
dry
and
very
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
great
tripel
not
as
heavy
as
some
ive
had
either
would
be
a
classic
with
a
better
nose
4
of
9
a
category
that
in
my
view
suffers
from
great
abuse
a
good
tripel
can
look
like
bilgewater
but
still
taste
wonderful
or
it
can
look
appealing
but
taste
like
bilgewater
rare
is
it
then
that
i
get
to
drink
a
tripel
that
both
looks
and
tastes
great
as
wellbehaved
as
any
belgian
beer
youll
find
all
your
favorite
tripel
characteristics
presented
in
a
wellbalanced
polite
and
understated
manner
no
hamhanded
orangejuice
yeasties
here
nor
will
you
be
dehydrated
from
overhopping
as
is
so
common
these
days
dare
i
say
that
this
is
uh
refreshing
well
almost
puts
most
other
tripels
to
shame
cheers
d
i
am
happy
its
a
750
the
cpj
on
the
whole
a
decent
enough
tripel
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
robustness
in
character
and
feel
from
it
but
its
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
id
revisit
la
fin
or
st
bernardus
before
this
one
again
though
one
of
my
favorites
im
always
happy
when
its
on
the
menu
pours
beautiful
light
clear
gold
with
excellent
lacing
scents
of
light
yeast
sweet
straw
and
flowers
just
nice
very
pleasant
flavor
more
so
than
its
darker
sister
beer
light
sweetness
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
yeastiness
hard
water
background
adds
to
the
experience
nicely
very
carbonated
so
pour
with
care
drinks
easy
so
bring
extra
money
overall
one
of
the
best
around
pour
brings
a
light
golden
color
that
is
mostly
transparent
with
a
severalfinger
white
head
good
retention
and
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
thin
cap
and
a
good
collar
the
nose
brings
hay
and
some
light
earthiness
along
with
some
grain
and
a
bit
of
floral
hop
character
flavor
is
light
and
refreshing
with
hay
and
grain
plus
some
mild
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
a
floral
quality
pretty
clean
yet
fairly
uneventful
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
good
carbonation
good
beer
overall
quite
nice
thanks
again
nevertheless
a
wonderful
brew
and
the
one
i
come
back
to
d
very
much
so
one
of
the
best
tripels
that
ive
had
d
great
for
an
after
dinner
brew
well
crafted
but
one
was
enough
for
an
evening
d
i
find
myself
swirling
it
a
bit
in
an
attempt
to
dissipate
the
carbo
d
delicious
and
refreshing
a
solid
brew
through
and
though
very
nice
beer
were
it
not
for
the
faint
soapiness
would
have
been
received
even
more
favorably
very
interesting
beer
conclusion
i
love
tripels
it
might
even
be
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
weaker
tripel
in
my
opinion
it
is
just
a
more
tame
version
of
the
great
ones
out
there
but
it
does
make
up
for
its
downsides
by
being
so
drinkable
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
belgian
ale
however
not
my
personal
cup
of
tea
as
it
were
perhaps
something
more
flavorful
would
be
more
to
my
liking
nevertheless
i
like
this
beer
there
is
a
distinct
belgian
yeast
and
citrus
aroma
along
with
a
nice
belgian
lace
that
sticks
around
for
a
good
bit
there
is
a
medium
bready
yeast
flavor
as
well
as
some
lingering
citrus
mainly
orange
in
my
opinion
its
not
a
lemony
tart
more
of
a
rounder
citrus
fruit
a
good
bit
of
spice
at
the
end
finishes
this
up
nicely
im
no
spice
expert
but
if
i
had
to
wager
a
guess
id
say
coriander
and
maybe
black
peppercorn
feel
is
a
touch
light
with
that
big
of
head
i
expected
a
bit
more
structure
still
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
easy
drinking
i
do
like
this
beer
a
lot
a
good
drinker
a
bit
dry
for
me
but
a
good
change
of
pace
sweet
tart
and
bitter
all
seemed
more
toned
down
here
than
in
the
brown
though
the
dryness
seemed
to
accentuate
the
tartness
in
the
end
on
the
other
hand
the
carbonation
was
more
biting
here
and
the
alcohol
more
burning
pair
this
with
any
cuisine
and
it
will
improve
the
entire
meal
a
classic
example
of
the
tripel
style
this
ale
is
very
well
made
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
really
enjoy
the
corsendonks
great
to
taste
this
against
the
brown
both
are
somewhat
tangy
but
the
brown
is
more
savory
where
the
pale
is
lighter
and
more
citrusy
neither
is
overwhelmingly
heavy
likewise
neither
is
particularly
light
a
great
level
of
carbonation
and
effervescence
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
as
close
to
perfect
drinkability
as
ive
encountered
with
the
style
this
should
pair
fabulously
with
a
wide
variety
of
autumnseasonal
cuisine
both
dinner
and
dessert

drinkabilty
i
think
this
is
a
good
starter
tripel
for
someone
its
mild
and
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
the
flavors
i
so
enjoy
with
tripels
this
is
no
way
as
good
as
la
fin
or
any
chimay
ales
its
ok
but
not
worth
the
4
i
spend
on
it
imo
one
and
done
for
me
great
beer
kind
of
like
a
fin
du
monde
d
probably
no
more
than
2
even
you
dont
feel
the
alcohol
the
effects
still
there
a
great
beer
to
drink
by
itself
or
with
a
nice
meal
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
tripel
though
i
am
wondering
what
exactly
happened
to
the
spiciness
as
they
just
dont
seem
to
show
up
in
the
taste
its
also
a
bit
weaker
than
many
tripels
which
should
make
it
a
little
more
drinkable
one
thing
it
isnt
short
of
however
is
sweetness
d
very
drinkable
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
is
subtle
and
perfectly
balanced
each
of
the
primary
elements
of
this
beers
flavor
malt
hops
and
yeast
is
present
in
just
the
right
amount
and
at
just
the
right
time
the
hops
compliment
the
rich
continental
malt
very
nicely
and
the
yeast
is
just
strong
enough
to
set
things
off
and
mark
this
as
a
proper
belgian
beer
a
true
classic
i
have
often
overlooked
this
beer
because
it
is
so
readily
available
and
offers
no
thrill
when
i
see
it
on
a
store
shelf
having
it
again
for
the
first
time
in
several
years
i
am
reminded
that
it
is
a
better
beer
than
many
other
rarer
examples
of
its
style
d
overall
enjoyable
and
refreshing
but
somewhat
filling
d
more
simple
and
laid
back
than
most
tripels
but
a
welcome
change
of
pace
d
a
little
heavy
on
the
funk
for
sustained
drinking
but
light
enough
to
take
down
easy
d
very
refreshing
could
drink
this
as
an
interesting
session
beer
pale
yellow
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
big
dense
foamy
belgian
head
lively
carbonation
that
adds
to
the
spicey
peppery
flavor
fruity
apple
and
sweet
malty
aromas
flavors
aplenty
with
a
sweet
maltiness
in
the
beginning
a
spicy
peppery
middle
and
a
hoppy
citrus
lemon
finish
a
fairly
dry
finish
but
with
some
bitter
aftertaste
lots
of
different
things
goings
on
here
all
kinds
of
aromas
and
flavors
along
with
the
beautiful
look
of
a
belgian
ale
the
higher
abv
is
not
at
all
noticeable
pours
a
golden
color
topped
with
big
fluffy
white
head
with
lots
of
carbonation
rising
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cork
i
could
smell
this
one
the
aroma
is
pretty
strong
and
it
quite
fruity
namely
apples
with
a
healthy
dose
of
the
yeastiness
i
like
in
tripels
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
the
taste
however
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
expectations
the
aroma
generated
a
nice
fruitiness
and
spiciness
and
a
very
slight
hoppiness
but
theyre
not
as
strong
as
id
like
and
fade
pretty
quickly
after
about
45
minutes
the
beer
was
almost
as
room
temperature
and
improved
a
bit
the
high
carbonation
makes
for
a
fuzzy
mouthfeel
on
top
of
an
otherwise
thin
body
for
the
style
the
beer
feels
crisp
and
dry
similar
to
some
saisons
ive
had
easily
drinkable
a
tight
head
of
bubbles
of
pure
white
about
two
fingers
yellow
orange
and
a
bit
cloudy
nose
of
belgian
sugar
cane
blended
nicely
with
the
malt
heavy
floral
lillies
and
lavender
pine
wonderful
blend
no
overall
sugar
sweet
a
tad
bitter
dry
finish
with
some
straw
qualities
of
munich
malt
mild
citrus
honey
i
nice
triple
for
those
that
are
turned
off
by
the
sugariness
of
belgian
beer
very
decent
tripel
refreshing
and
complex
at
the
same
time
d
a
good
brew
that
treads
the
line
of
tripel
and
belgian
pale
ale
which
is
definitely
better
tasted
with
some
warming
to
bring
out
more
malt
complexity
and
gives
the
carbonation
a
chance
to
tone
down
decent
but
a
little
lackluster
i
like
the
corsendonk
brown
ale
better
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
but
dry
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
a
solid
beer
its
been
too
long
since
i
last
had
corsendonks
brown
ale
so
i
dont
know
how
this
compares
but
this
stands
well
on
its
own
if
not
absolutely
worldclass
like
chimay
blue
recommended
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
it
is
a
bit
unusual
in
the
amount
of
citrus
flavor
it
contains
but
i
feel
it
worked
in
this
case
the
spice
and
hints
of
hops
at
the
end
helped
balance
keeping
it
from
being
too
sweet
d
a
nice
drinker
by
all
means
and
a
very
nice
trippel
just
still
kinda
weird
drinking
the
solid
particles
i
had
to
take
off
for
it
somewhere
overall
a
good
beer
altough
not
the
best
of
its
kind
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
fairly
intense
carbonation
par
for
the
style
and
excellent
drinkability
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
that
is
easy
drinking
and
hides
it
potency
quite
well
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
fluffy
with
a
dry
and
clean
finish
goes
down
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
even
though
the
abv
is
a
little
higher
it
is
still
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
night
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
tripel
just
not
the
best
that
ive
had
all
the
ingredients
are
there
for
a
great
beer
it
just
falls
a
bit
short
because
of
minor
flaws
here
and
there
make
no
mistake
though
this
is
still
a
tasty
beer
that
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
drinkability
well
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
im
not
thinking
ill
be
having
another
unless
it
is
with
food
the
flavors
are
a
bit
simple
and
one
dimensional
and
by
the
end
of
the
beer
its
a
bit
too
much
like
drinking
orange
soda
bittered
with
zest
very
tasty
a
very
good
and
well
balanced
beer
that
gets
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
a
definite
recommendation
i
wonder
how
much
better
it
can
get
pours
a
pale
goldenstraw
color
with
large
bubbled
white
head
but
the
head
wasnt
very
thick
and
lacked
good
retention
nose
has
musty
fruits
on
the
palate
theres
a
fruit
syrupy
sweetness
up
front
then
a
honeyedchampagne
like
middle
to
finish
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
woodymetallic
tang
at
the
end
certainly
not
a
sessionable
beer
for
me
but
not
bad
on
the
drinkability
drinkability
not
the
best
example
of
a
tripel
available
but
this
beer
holds
its
own
still
a
savory
beer
and
definitely
an
easier
drink
than
many
tripels
score
4
overall
good
triple
for
sure
this
is
a
much
better
triple
than
their
double
is
a
double
everything
just
meshed
better
on
this
one
very
nice
looking
and
drinkable
until
the
end
one
to
try
if
you
like
the
style
tangy
with
orchard
fruit
flavors
up
front
well
balanced
with
light
malt
sweetness
floral
hops
and
muted
alcohol
warmth
finishes
with
dried
apricot
white
grapes
and
expensive
honey
spiced
with
clove
plenty
of
silky
co2
d
for
me
tripels
can
sometimes
be
a
little
bit
much
especially
in
alcohol
heat
and
feel
this
one
doesnt
have
much
of
that
burn
in
it
overall
has
a
smooth
feel
with
tons
of
belgian
character
and
flavors
very
enjoyable
would
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
drinkability
a
decent
tripel
thats
pretty
drinkable
its
not
the
most
flavorful
tripel
out
there
but
its
still
damn
good
i
bought
this
beer
on
a
whim
because
it
came
with
a
glass
so
i
wasnt
expecting
much
that
said
im
really
pleased
with
this
beer
buy
it
and
get
the
glass
too
drinkability
is
good
as
a
desert
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
dry
with
a
nice
mild
aftertaste
drinkability
corsendonk
pale
ale
is
a
nice
middle
ground
in
tripels
it
has
a
good
flavor
which
while
not
overly
complex
is
also
very
approachable
i
could
drink
tons
of
this
stuff
slainte
mouthfeel
is
okay
a
bit
viscous
though
which
is
surprising
but
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
makes
the
brew
really
creamy
after
a
toungeswirl
d
i
could
drown
in
this
or
any
other
belgian
triple
mouthfeel
quite
carbonated
medium
body
creamy
and
dry
thanks
to
mel
for
the
treat
served
in
a
ridicuously
oversized
wine
glass
with
a
cloudyyeasty
pour
dark
amber
to
brown
in
color
aroma
is
of
red
wine
and
freshly
baked
bread
sweet
and
pleasant
my
initial
flavor
impression
is
of
dark
chocolate
and
raisins
bittersweet
and
dark
fruits
its
not
hoppy
not
phenolic
and
not
very
belgianlike
at
all
again
though
its
sweet
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
light
and
finishes
sweet
the
bottle
was
shared
with
my
friend
and
was
finished
quickly
a
tasty
treat
lower
on
alcohol
than
some
so
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
best
trippel
ive
had
by
a
long
shot
worth
trying
probably
not
going
to
top
my
list
of
beers
to
buy
when
i
think
of
trippels
though
extremely
drinkable
for
a
tripel
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
d
something
is
missing
here
little
too
dry
and
salty
for
me
a
little
more
sweet
malts
would
added
a
little
more
depth
overall
a
very
drinkable
nice
triple
but
nothing
too
distinctive
to
set
it
apart
from
the
bunch
quite
nice
though
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
the
flavours
seem
somewhat
out
of
whack
and
the
alcohol
isnt
particularly
well
integrated
i
think
i
like
the
pater
dubbel
better
this
beer
was
brewed
by
the
master
crafstmen
in
the
classic
belgian
tripel
style
a
little
lighter
in
body
than
most
of
the
other
tripels
i
have
had
which
increased
its
drinkability
drank
very
well
and
left
a
pleasant
aftertaste
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
fluffy
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
zest
and
clove
and
sour
yeast
with
salty
and
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
tasted
like
waxy
lemon
and
sour
yeast
with
some
salty
and
grassy
hops
and
pepper
it
was
slightly
thick
and
oily
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
tasted
a
bit
strange
but
was
at
least
clean
and
drinkable
it
had
nice
body
and
hid
the
alcohol
decently
there
was
nothing
unique
or
exciting
about
this
beer
but
perhaps
age
would
help
mellow
out
the
waxy
and
salty
flavors
but
while
this
beer
is
fresh
im
really
not
a
fan
great
atmosphere
pretty
solid
appearance
great
nose
complex
full
flavor
and
light
body
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
this
might
have
been
a
bad
bottle
there
was
a
lot
of
sediment
on
the
poor
for
a
bottle
that
has
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
very
drinkable
indeed
i
dont
know
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
get
around
to
tracking
this
down
and
trying
it
if
i
was
jonesing
for
a
belgian
and
there
was
nothing
else
around
to
include
the
better
belgianstyle
domestic
micros
id
go
for
it
because
its
a
good
beer
but
i
just
cant
call
it
a
good
tripel
again
this
beer
reminds
more
of
a
belgian
pale
due
to
the
drinkability
and
balance
less
sweet
a
very
good
beer
that
i
am
really
happy
i
tried
in
fact
i
think
im
going
to
grab
another
bottle
or
two
to
enjoy
later
if
you
like
duvel
this
beer
is
for
you
as
it
reminded
me
of
it
great
overall
this
isnt
a
terribly
complex
trippel
but
everything
that
is
done
is
done
well
and
all
flavors
are
crisp
worth
a
shot
the
after
taste
makes
this
beer
a
one
and
done
for
me
which
is
a
shame
because
the
beer
opens
up
well
if
that
oilmetallic
tastecould
get
in
check
this
would
be
a
much
better
tripel
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
quite
as
captivating
as
some
of
the
top
tripels
out
there
but
solid
all
around
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
while
i
was
very
surprised
that
beer
advocate
calls
it
a
triple
i
think
its
more
exactly
like
what
they
call
it
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
lot
its
like
a
duvel
with
a
little
less
alcohol
only
a
little
more
fruity
good
appearance
very
good
smell
and
taste
one
to
try
again
if
its
been
a
while
for
you
as
well
if
you
like
la
fin
du
monde
and
duvel
i
think
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
d
no
question
about
it
very
drinkable
drinkability
who
knew
beers
named
after
old
ladies
could
be
so
lively
so
spry
so
invigorating
not
me
again
this
is
the
most
nonintrusive
brew
ive
ever
had
very
in
the
middle
and
sure
to
please
even
the
most
non
beer
drinker
mfd
body
seemed
fine
nothing
special
nothing
bad
carbonation
was
good
and
gassy
for
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
the
beer
wasnt
that
creamy
and
mouth
coating
but
i
can
harldly
say
i
care
about
that
kind
of
stuff
after
so
much
beer
a
decent
brew
but
i
have
better
equal
price
choices
that
i
would
pick
from
now
on
drinkability
this
goes
down
fast
but
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
its
ok
not
at
all
my
favorite
tripel
drinkability
although
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
rather
restrained
for
a
tripel
the
lack
of
complexity
actual
makes
the
beer
all
the
more
drinkable
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
i
am
really
enjoying
this
one
its
funky
and
i
am
liking
the
hop
notes
coupled
with
the
funky
belgian
flavor
as
the
beer
continues
to
warm
up
it
gets
better
and
better
hoppy
funky
an
sweet
drinkable
and
delicious
very
drinkable
very
good
beer
d
one
of
the
most
fullflavoured
tasty
belgian
pales
ive
had
if
i
was
judging
it
in
that
style
didnt
know
it
was
a
tripel
when
i
had
it
i
guess
that
explains
the
big
flavours
a
must
try
my
bottle
had
a
lot
of
sediment
the
color
was
like
straw
a
hazy
golden
yellow
the
smell
was
malty
and
a
hint
of
coriander
but
is
not
an
overwhelming
strong
smell
the
taste
is
crisp
and
sweet
some
hints
of
banana
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
bubbly
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
poured
into
my
st
bernardus
watou
glass
a
very
nice
cloudy
yellow
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
very
nice
twofinger
creamy
white
head
tons
and
tons
of
nice
thick
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
with
some
bananas
and
corinander
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
nice
maltiness
yeast
notes
with
a
touch
of
banannacoriander
medium
body
medium
carbonation
creamy
texture
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
little
brew
d
great
tripel
and
a
welldone
representation
of
the
style
the
drink
had
a
pale
yellow
appearance
with
a
rather
large
head
with
good
retention
i
sensed
a
slight
metallic
aroma
from
the
beer
mostly
mixed
within
a
yeasty
biscuitlike
flavoring
pretty
sour
in
general
with
that
metallic
taste
in
there
great
carbonation
really
helped
in
making
a
crisp
drink
overall
pretty
darn
good
very
well
balanced
ale
complex
with
lots
of
flavors
complimenting
each
other
very
enjoyable
wow
what
a
delicious
beer
appearence
is
the
only
aspect
of
this
beer
that
is
uninteresting
it
smells
like
what
i
think
a
belgian
beer
should
it
has
all
those
flavors
without
those
more
hot
fusol
flavors
that
some
belgians
tend
to
have
a
beutiful
color
is
topped
only
by
the
balance
of
malt
hint
of
sweetness
hop
bitterness
and
smoothxester
profile
one
of
my
favorite
goto
beer
also
in
a
corked
bottle
that
surpasses
the
beauty
of
any
champaine
ive
ever
had
id
say
this
belgian
is
lower
on
the
complexity
scale
but
what
it
did
well
allowed
me
to
enjoy
it
from
beginning
to
end
the
interplay
of
the
initial
mouthfeel
and
lingering
taste
on
the
palate
demanded
i
continue
to
sip
an
enjoyable
cycle
until
my
glass
was
empty
try
it
out
dotson
the
foam
exploded
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
off
i
had
to
pour
immediately
and
the
glass
ended
up
being
75
foam
so
i
poured
a
second
as
well
appearance
was
very
pale
head
retained
well
throughout
smelled
of
sour
malt
tasted
of
sour
malt
and
ethanol
very
heavy
on
the
ethanol
mouthfeel
was
decent
but
there
was
a
very
unpleasant
lingering
aftertaste
made
my
choice
to
drink
at
maxs
on
broadway
the
beer
looked
and
smelled
great
i
thought
the
beer
was
over
spiced
and
hid
many
of
the
good
flavor
it
was
smooth
and
not
too
heavy
in
the
mouth
which
made
it
go
down
easy
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
to
have
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
put
it
past
me
d
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
the
lead
aroma
is
the
yeast
with
something
citrus
and
herbal
like
close
behind
medium
mouthfeel
the
flavor
begins
yeasty
and
ends
with
a
drier
herbal
finale
a
good
abbey
ale
i
could
totally
drink
this
in
vast
quantities
while
overlooking
a
river
valley
on
a
clear
warm
summer
day
very
good
cheap
for
style
and
drinkable
pours
a
very
watery
pale
yellow
color
humungous
white
frothy
head
somewhat
lasting
aroma
of
very
light
flowers
straw
sweet
somewhat
musky
aroma
not
strong
grape
and
light
sweet
fruit
smell
some
malt
grape
fizzy
musky
tastej
grapeskins
floral
soft
mouthfeel
a
little
warming
kinda
bland
better
as
it
wams
poured
into
a
tulip
for
an
orangish
body
with
yeast
particles
floating
in
it
also
the
brew
came
with
a
voluminous
threefinger
head
that
took
forever
to
die
and
i
could
hear
it
descending
like
the
sound
of
rice
krispies
when
you
add
milk
has
that
great
belgian
smell
hints
of
hops
and
yeast
to
create
a
fruity
smell
like
orange
and
banana
along
with
some
mild
caramel
malts
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
the
beer
is
a
fluffy
medium
body
but
also
a
little
thick
smooth
and
quasicreamy
the
caramel
malt
is
really
assertive
with
the
hops
for
a
sweeter
milder
fruit
taste
that
is
subdued
and
finishes
easy
there
are
other
malts
in
play
as
well
such
as
nut
or
bread
maybe
even
toffee
the
fruit
tastes
are
pronounced
orange
banana
hints
of
apple
an
easy
going
triple
that
i
can
have
anytime
another
dangerous
belgian
tripel
i
could
drink
these
all
day
in
the
summer
and
all
night
in
the
winter
as
versatile
as
it
is
not
as
complex
or
strong
as
ive
had
but
that
does
not
score
badly
with
me
on
this
just
makes
me
feel
like
drinking
more
medium
body
and
carbonation
quite
drinkable
very
refreshing
taste
pleasing
to
the
palate
and
no
surprises
from
the
aroma
very
nice
beer
not
a
bold
or
breathtaking
tripel
but
good
and
refreshing
notes
from
072704
from
the
few
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewer
i
am
not
pleased
at
all
excellent
ale
and
i
have
more
than
once
drank
more
in
one
sitting
than
i
should
have
future
outlook
fantastic
beer
that
i
wish
id
tried
sooner
will
certainly
purchase
again
taste
the
vanilla
and
fruitiness
from
the
smell
are
present
in
the
taste
very
creamy
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
new
hollands
black
tulip
trippel
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
new
holland
stole
this
beers
yeast
to
make
their
tripel
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
its
not
huge
or
aggressive
but
a
fine
bodied
enjoyable
brew
tasty
and
smooth
d
good
clean
with
a
well
hidden
abv
and
bright
crisp
grainy
flavor
that
definitely
is
worthy
seeking
out
pours
gold
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
big
head
nice
light
aroma
of
yeast
and
malt
cloves
pepper
and
grass
round
out
the
nose
good
esterous
taste
with
a
blend
of
spice
and
just
enough
hops
good
amount
of
lighter
fruits
pear
green
apple
and
a
little
banana
very
nice
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
lasts
throughout
aroma
is
slightly
spicy
with
crisp
light
fruit
notes
has
a
sweet
almost
champagne
like
taste
to
it
but
not
too
carbonated
apple
pear
light
raisin
flavors
balanced
by
slight
alcohol
warmth
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
now
this
is
a
tripel
ive
had
this
before
and
thought
i
had
already
rated
it
nice
yeasty
and
spicy
aroma
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
clove
pour
was
a
beautiful
light
gold
with
a
huge
3
finger
head
and
tons
of
small
rising
bubbles
and
great
sediment
taste
was
delicious
extremely
dry
and
spicy
pear
apple
and
yeast
in
the
front
with
a
strong
bite
from
the
carbonation
and
a
peppery
element
in
the
cheeks
great
beer
drinkability
alcohol
is
well
disguised
and
at
7
5
objectively
not
very
high
for
a
triple
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
pours
clear
golden
with
a
fluffy
head
nice
lacing
aroma
is
grassy
and
citric
there
is
a
grassyearthy
undertone
to
the
flavor
but
mostly
it
is
crisp
clean
citrus
i
wouldnt
want
to
do
it
to
this
beer
but
if
you
started
a
trend
of
serving
this
with
a
slice
of
lemon
i
think
it
would
become
popular
with
the
crowd
that
cant
appreciate
this
one
on
its
own
four
pack
been
sitting
on
the
shelves
for
years
blew
off
the
dust
and
poured
into
the
glass
vibrant
gold
color
with
a
touch
of
orange
crazy
carbonation
and
a
huge
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
of
blended
sour
fruits
and
grass
i
pucker
a
bit
as
i
sip
on
this
relatively
lively
on
the
tongue
not
real
crisp
with
the
finish
flavor
is
earthy
with
notes
of
pears
and
grapefruit
dont
know
quite
how
well
this
should
hold
up
under
long
storage
and
this
pack
is
considerably
old
still
interesting
and
enjoyable
would
like
to
find
a
new
bottle
and
compare
nonetheless
this
is
quite
good
although
not
nearly
the
equivalent
of
corsendonks
christmas
ale
or
abbey
brown
well
worth
trying
and
enjoyable
drinkability
not
too
high
in
abv
for
a
tripel
making
this
one
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
nicely
refreshing
and
smooth
hides
the
alcohol
perhaps
not
a
typical
tripel
it
is
a
beer
worth
getting
also
i
love
the
bottles
i
could
see
enjoying
a
few
of
these
at
one
sitting
with
no
problem
the
ones
i
had
were
not
aged
and
supposedly
this
gets
even
smoother
and
more
rounded
with
age
i
kept
a
couple
bottles
which
will
stay
in
storage
for
a
while
just
to
compare
all
in
all
a
very
nice
pale
ale
d
this
was
an
enjoyable
tripel
and
worked
well
with
pizza
but
there
are
countless
other
tripels
that
can
be
enjoyed
more
for
the
same
amount
of
money
as
this
one
notes
not
my
favorite
tripel
or
my
favorite
belgian
not
a
terrible
beer
but
as
i
have
written
forgettable
d
perhaps
a
little
strong
to
be
very
drinkable
but
it
drinks
very
well
for
its
abv
d
this
is
a
decent
wellmade
beer
the
trappist
varieties
perhaps
have
a
little
more
complexity
though
i
have
to
admit
though
that
corendonk
pale
was
one
of
the
first
belgian
beers
i
ever
tried
i
still
have
a
fondness
for
it
years
later
drinkability
easy
to
drink
i
guess
it
would
be
a
good
once
and
a
while
beer
drinkability
very
good
i
was
skeptical
of
the
yeast
floating
but
i
didnt
notice
it
if
you
are
a
fan
of
belgian
ales
you
will
absolutely
like
this
bonus
points
for
the
abv
which
seems
higher
than
your
average
belgian
ale
i
am
a
little
disappointed
as
their
brown
is
pretty
damned
good
and
this
was
just
so
so
that
being
said
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
if
the
price
were
right
drink
ability
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
although
pairings
would
be
difficult
outside
of
cheeses
and
crackers
i
think
this
beer
would
go
well
with
piea
pours
a
clean
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
maltiness
in
the
taste
a
sweet
malt
and
a
dry
sugar
taste
a
small
bite
and
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
nice
pale
easy
drinking
and
non
offensive
good
mouthfeel
and
pretty
decent
drinkability
a
good
all
around
tripel
that
isnt
too
artificially
sweet
like
some
others
out
there
d
very
high
but
no
joke
7
5
great
medium
bodied
feel
with
nice
carbonation
and
superb
drinkability
overall
an
average
tripel
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
worth
a
try
once
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
thin
white
lacey
head
with
a
golden
color
smell
is
of
fermented
apples
and
spices
taste
is
unique
like
cloves
and
nutmeg
ontop
of
a
light
malt
flavor
with
subtle
hints
of
malt
mouthfeel
is
really
bubbley
and
crisp
it
has
a
pleasant
taste
and
i
could
drink
more
then
one
but
for
the
price
it
wouldnt
be
at
the
top
of
beers
id
buy
list
but
it
certainly
would
be
far
from
the
bottom
perhaps
the
best
beer
of
the
night
among
several
a
good
beer
to
sit
down
and
drink
without
thinking
too
much
about
but
also
has
an
above
average
taste
with
some
complexity
to
tease
the
mouth
and
senses
including
a
great
initial
hit
quite
happy
with
this
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
golden
in
color
with
millions
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
up
to
a
sparkling
white
soapy
head
smell
is
sweet
and
spicy
slight
fruitiness
and
clove
smell
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
alcohol
presence
and
warming
sensation
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
a
bubbly
aggressive
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
bad
i
expected
more
out
of
this
beer
i
guess
ive
had
better
belgians
than
this
and
i
expected
this
one
to
be
up
to
par
d
7
5
abv
but
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
tripel
i
think
it
has
a
very
high
drinkability
for
the
style
all
around
good
beer
its
a
nice
tastey
triple
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
for
years
didnt
realise
i
hadnt
reviewed
it
before
d
this
is
a
weird
one
in
a
blind
tasting
i
might
have
guessed
that
this
was
a
boozy
american
wheat
ale
or
even
a
witbier
this
isnt
bad
beer
but
it
is
one
of
the
most
tangy
twangy
lemony
wheaty
beers
that
ive
ever
had
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
not
quite
i
expected
d
i
am
very
disappointed
i
dont
have
another
of
these
lying
around
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
drinkability
smooth
and
easy
drinking
not
as
pleasurable
as
the
brune
but
still
a
wonderful
balanced
belgian
tripel
possibly
bottle
conditioned
with
a
lager
yeast
very
nice
very
pleasant
fresh
honeyed
applepear
notes
nicely
yeasty
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
effervescent
and
crisp
giving
quite
a
lightened
effect
for
a
largish
beer
the
flavor
is
deliciously
spicy
with
corander
and
clove
crisp
appley
fruitiness
and
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
i
very
much
enjoy
this
restrained
sweetness
as
attempts
at
the
tripel
style
are
often
too
sweet
see
golden
monkey
the
spicy
dryness
keeps
this
brew
very
drinkable
and
i
finish
it
faster
that
i
would
like
very
nice
d
drinkable
but
ill
stick
to
the
abbey
brown
ale
the
pour
was
a
bubbly
cloudy
gold
with
a
two
finger
white
head
the
aroma
of
citrus
and
honey
was
present
the
taste
was
close
to
the
smell
with
a
alcoholic
after
note
the
carbonation
excites
the
palate
so
i
wouldnt
try
to
slam
this
beer
down
enjoy
it
it
is
easy
to
drink
d
very
smooth
drinkable
tripel
with
subtle
flavors
and
wellconcealed
alcohol
presence
this
one
goes
to
the
top
of
the
heap
as
far
as
authentic
belgian
tripels
are
concerned
my
favorite
of
the
beers
from
corsendonk
delicious
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
light
in
body
and
has
higher
carbonation
that
scrubs
my
palate
clean
as
i
get
deeper
into
the
bottle
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
more
making
this
beer
easier
to
drink
not
so
much
foaming
in
the
mouth
still
though
i
feel
that
there
could
be
just
a
touch
less
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
leaves
my
mouth
watering
for
more
a
mixture
of
sweetness
and
spice
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
reminding
one
of
what
this
beer
tastes
like
this
is
a
beer
id
drink
again
but
i
think
id
rather
try
more
before
coming
back
i
definitely
prefer
la
fin
du
monde
to
this
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beers
granted
i
have
a
bias
towards
belgian
beers
specifically
this
style
d
highly
drinkable
stuff
not
as
flavorful
as
some
other
belgian
tripels
but
a
very
well
done
example
of
the
style
this
is
one
beer
that
has
been
seen
on
a
regular
basis
ar
al
of
the
liquor
stores
that
i
frequent
finally
decided
to
give
it
a
try
i
poured
this
one
into
a
deep
tulip
glass
ar
foamy
fluffy
white
head
emerges
slowly
and
the
bright
orangey
yellow
golden
liquid
appears
smelled
floral
and
sweet
a
cpmpletely
full
aromatic
experience
tasted
spicey
ad
rich
tons
of
peppery
spices
some
fruity
zest
and
a
hoppy
punch
smooth
going
down
very
enjoyable
world
class
corsendonks
brown
abbey
ale
was
outstanding
and
the
pale
tripel
version
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
this
is
some
seriously
highquality
stuff
some
of
the
best
around
this
brew
was
completely
terrific
in
almost
all
respects
pours
a
gorgeous
cloudy
hazy
color
with
impressive
foamy
head
with
some
sediment
visible
smell
was
great
full
of
fresh
grapefruit
citrus
and
fresh
flowers
taste
was
above
and
beyond
complemented
the
aroma
strongly
with
strong
floral
and
citrus
notes
dominated
by
an
overall
sweet
candied
flavor
that
really
hit
home
mouthfeel
was
outstanding
and
as
far
as
the
7
5
abv
you
can
forget
about
detecting
any
alcohol
this
beer
is
all
candy
and
sweets
great
finish
with
a
wonderful
aftertaste
cant
really
say
anything
bad
about
this
one
a
musttry
definitely
recommended
pours
a
light
gold
and
is
much
lighter
and
doesnt
have
the
punch
and
flavor
of
the
brown
ale
which
is
absolutely
normal
since
this
is
the
pale
ale
overall
pale
ales
are
less
my
style
and
i
would
tend
to
side
with
the
brown
which
i
admit
i
am
biased
towards
because
of
personal
preference
rating
it
on
its
style
it
is
very
well
made
and
is
definitely
worth
trying
it
is
just
not
my
most
favorite
style
is
all
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
could
sip
any
day
this
is
not
a
beer
to
just
slam
over
but
rather
to
savor
and
sip
pretty
good
tripel
drinks
alright
but
a
bit
too
complex
too
session
on
a
solid
but
not
spectacular
tripel
this
beer
is
sandy
golden
is
color
with
a
rich
creamy
white
head
noted
is
free
flowing
sediment
it
imparts
a
spicy
aroma
which
i
would
place
as
eigher
grains
of
paradise
or
corriander
it
has
a
spicey
sweet
almost
honey
malty
taste
the
spices
are
really
well
balanced
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
pale
ale
i
may
mistake
this
for
a
belgian
white
ale
instead
just
a
breat
beer
not
the
most
complex
or
rich
tripel
from
belgium
but
the
alcohol
is
wellcovered
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
nice
aroma
that
doesnt
quite
translate
as
richly
to
the
taste
one
to
choose
for
a
milder
version
of
the
style
pours
a
nice
gold
with
a
big
carbonated
head
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
constantly
replenishes
the
head
aroma
is
yeasty
and
citrusy
while
the
taste
is
very
zesty
and
crisp
a
little
sweet
but
not
as
great
as
some
other
beers
of
the
style
a
tad
flat
going
down
but
nothing
awful
all
in
all
a
solid
brew
one
of
the
most
drinkable
belgians
i
have
had
review
added
11112007
translated
from
french
2272008
overall
i
was
quite
pleased
with
the
corsendonk
pale
abbey
ale
its
definitely
got
that
belgian
flair
and
complex
alcoholic
trip
youd
expect
from
an
authentic
tripel
nicely
done
indeed
i
dont
like
corsendonk
abbey
pale
ale
as
much
as
i
like
abbey
brown
ale
and
christmas
ale
despite
the
fact
that
ive
given
all
three
identical
flavor
scores
christmas
ale
was
my
first
belgian
beer
and
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
id
score
it
higher
nowadays
if
you
like
a
certain
austere
elegance
from
your
tripels
rather
than
the
down
and
dirty
aggressiveness
of
a
mad
bitch
give
this
one
a
whirl
d
drinkable
but
ill
stick
to
the
abbey
brown
ale
from
these
guys
its
better
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
nothing
mindblowing
mind
you
but
solid
id
have
it
again
for
sure
recommended
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
bottle
best
by
date
clearly
stamped
on
the
neck
label

abv
they
had
a
suggestion
for
aging
the
ale
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
but
i
did
not
take
the
advice
nice
fluffy
snow
white
head
that
receded
slowly
leaving
a
nice
clingy
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
bright
pale
hazy
golden
yellow
color
very
bright
yellow
with
mixed
in
sediment
when
back
lit
certainly
a
decent
looking
presentation
with
the
brightness
of
its
color
and
the
big
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
rather
sweet
like
sugar
cookie
dough
mild
fruity
tones
also
come
into
the
nose
slight
alcohol
esters
mixed
in
with
a
slight
spiced
note
that
hides
in
the
back
ground
there
are
hints
of
a
sweet
bread
dough
flavor
that
come
to
mind
with
the
initial
taste
certainly
can
taste
the
sweetness
brought
on
by
the
pale
malt
and
the
alcohol
mild
hints
of
hops
in
the
finish
making
for
a
well
balance
taste
the
flavors
on
the
tongue
certainly
have
that
distinct
belgium
flavor
slight
yeasty
flavor
mixed
with
a
mild
dry
bitterness
in
the
aster
taste
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
i
will
certainly
try
this
offering
again
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
that
holds
up
to
multiple
servings
not
overly
complex
but
what
it
does
it
does
well
this
beer
poured
a
straw
color
with
a
thick
head

tight
bubbles
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
spicyfloral
and
the
hops
are
apparent
the
taste
is
spicy
and
subtle
with
some
earthy
flavors

nicely
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
shy
of
medium
overall
this
is
an
easily
palatable
brew
that
simply
works
nicely
balanced
tripel
that
is
perfect
for
introducing
someone
to
the
style
and
veterans
can
simply
pick
up
and
enjoy
not
overly
robust
like
some
tripels
but
it
has
some
substance
and
is
rather
delicious
tasteful
and
satisfying
overall
a
good
but
somewhat
boring
belgian
pale
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
pint
of
it
either
d
apart
from
the
appearance
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
wonderfully
refreshing
and
light
but
full
of
flavor
and
complexity
very
little
alcohol
effect
highly
recommended
notes
at
7
5
this
is
mild
to
moderate
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
other
tripels
out
there
but
without
sacrificing
flavor
however
it
was
the
relative
lack
of
complexity
that
puts
this
beer
into
a
lower
tier
than
some
of
the
other
belgians
out
there
nevertheless
this
was
a
good
one
that
i
may
pick
up
again
excellent
brew
overall
a
solid
tripel
that
unfortunately
does
nothing
to
attain
its
potential
an
og
to
be
sure
and
a
solid
intro
to
the
style
doesnt
let
down
but
does
nothing
to
wow
you
either
just
plain
solid
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
orange
color
with
an
explosive
soapy
white
head
left
some
light
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
candi
sugar
tart
apple
honey
the
taste
is
sweet
from
the
candi
sugar
some
honeysuckle
granny
smith
apple
the
brew
tends
to
stay
on
the
sweet
side
the
feel
is
well
carbonated
and
finished
a
bit
slick
and
sweet
besides
being
a
bit
unbalanced
on
the
sweet
side
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
and
at
7
5
alcohol
you
can
drink
a
few
and
still
remember
your
name
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
tripel
and
one
i
enjoy
it
is
not
outstanding
and
is
a
bit
more
subtle
than
many
of
my
favorites
but
it
is
well
worth
drinking
i
cant
quite
figure
this
one
out
nice
3
finger
head
on
initial
pour
light
head
that
lingers
the
whole
time
the
smell
of
hops
and
citrus
in
somewhat
powerful
expected
more
but
not
bad
smooth
creamy
taste
light
leaves
you
wanting
more
again
better
once
gets
closer
to
room
temp
750ml
good
drinkability
better
than
some
an
enjoyable
tripel
this
is
a
fairly
light
and
dry
beer
no
doubt
due
to
the
use
of
the
candi
sugar
boderline
watery
but
certainly
not
bad
the
carbonation
is
wonderful
i
love
corked
beer
and
this
is
very
drinkable
while
not
packed
with
flavour
and
a
little
boring
for
the
style
this
is
a
good
offering
and
pairs
well
with
the
heat
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
due
to
the
fact
that
its
so
tame
and
less
flavorful
compared
to
other
tripels
i
guess
thats
the
one
thing
its
got
going
for
it
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
there
are
many
more
tripels
out
there
that
are
far
better
d
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
far
from
a
great
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
four
finger
fluffy
white
head
with
a
very
easy
pour
that
settles
to
a
rocky
one
inch
with
patchs
of
sticky
lace
aromas
of
apples
pears
and
hint
of
spice
wheat
malt
mixing
with
fruit
flavors
and
slight
spice
and
touch
of
hops
make
for
a
great
taste
i
think
the
lower
abv
7
50
works
so
much
better
for
this
style
than
the
higher
abv
tripel
styles
mouthfeel
light
dry
carbonation
ok
really
liked
this
one
and
would
buy
it
again
a
very
nice
beer
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
light
fish
not
the
benchmark
for
the
style
but
worth
trying
if
it
is
available
to
you
a
style
worth
exploration
old
standard
kind
of
a
belgian
session
ale
if
there
could
be
such
a
thang
lots
of
the
classic
belgian
characteristics
like
the
viniousness
and
depth
of
flavor
pours
with
a
small
head
and
some

nice
golden
amber
color
yeasty

spicey
aroma
and
flavor
flavor

extra
light

champagney
zesty

served
a
crisp
golden
yellow
with
a
diminishing
head
the
aroma
was
lightly
floral
with
light
fruits
there
was
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
slight
yeast
bite
the
alcohol
was
somewhat
present
and
the
beer
sat
moderately
light
on
the
tongue
with
slight
carbonation
this
beer
was
somewhat
enjoyable
but
not
the
best
of
the
style

i
gave
this
one
a
try
last
evening
as
i
love
the
other
offerings
from
brouwerij
corsendonk
this
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
with
a
golden
color
with
a
yellow
tinge
to
it
while
also
possessing
a
huge
almost
out
of
control
white
colored
head
that
had
retention
and
did
leave
some
nice
lacing
not
sure
if
the
temp
could
have
had
any
play
on
the
extreme
carbonation
that
seemed
to
be
at
play
the
aromas
where
nice
sweet
malt
that
seemed
to
have
properties
of
rock
candy
spiciness
and
pepper
come
out
along
with
a
citrus
fruit
like
property
the
taste
is
also
good
lemon
come
out
in
front
then
it
turns
to
more
of
the
spices
that
seem
to
tickle
the
tongue
another
thing
that
i
notice
is
the
amount
of
bubbling
that
is
going
on
see
a
ton
of
bubbles
transverse
up
the
side
of
the
glass
this
is
a
good
beer
and
they
way
i
described
it
above
i
guess
i
would
expect
to
give
it
a
better
rating
but
for
me
it
does
not
live
of
to
its
brother
brews
from
corsendonk
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
solid
belgium
pale
but
do
think
that
there
are
others
out
there
that
are
better
and
more
interesting
good
but
not
as
good
as
the

a
nice
silkscreened
bottle
neatly
caged

with
huge
head
with
big
suds
that
sit
for

musty
appearance
but
a
very
pretty
yellow

very
pretty
i
feel
lots
of
bubbles

a

is
great
very
good
balanced
and
very
drinkable
this
is
always
a
favorite
of
mine
it
is
a
great
and
tasty
belgian
it
may
seem
a
little
small
for
a
triple
based
on
americas
bigger
is
better
beer
culture
but
this
is
an
extremely
well
made
and
well
balanced
example
of
the
style
pours
a
nice
amberish
yellow
thats
got
a
nice
clarity
to
it
on
top
is
a
fluffy
white
head
that
if
you
arent
careful
could
go
wild
and
engulf
your
beer
vessel
looks
good
smells
slightly
of
the
typical
belgian
spices
and
fruit
esters
corriander
cloves
banana
etc
now
in
a
tripel
i
expect
a
nice
big
pungent
nose
but
this
one
was
disappointingly
weak
there
were
only
slight
traces
of
these
aromas
taste
was
unfortunately
weak
as
well
although
not
entirely
upsetting
after
taking
a
few
whiffs
there
was
also
a
faint
detection
of
skunk
in
the
airy
mouthfeel
which
wasnt
too
distracting
the
beer
is
despite
its
shortcomings
rather
drinkable
as
its
flavors
are
much
lighter
and
the
mouthfeel
being
so
light
so
overall
i
wasnt
really
too
impressed
with
this
one
i
would
not
buy
it
again
poured
from
an
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
delirium
tremens
tulipstyle
glass
huge
froth
on
top
of
hazy
pale
orange
beer
really
nice
looking
the
smell
was
a
touch
skunky
maybe
this
was
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
a
long
time
but
i
could
still
smell
the
yeasty
aroma
so
it
wasnt
a
completely
poor
aroma
the
flavor
was
really
good
similar
in
a
bready
yeasty
way
to
st
bernardus
tripel
maybe
a
tad
more
sweet
upfront
than
the
st
bernardus
and
the
mouthfeel
was
very
very
thick
really
good
belgian
pale
ale
in
a
general
drinking
process
this
is
quite
enjoyable
varieties
of
flavors
lightness
and
texture
from
the
carbonation
the
nice
sweetness
stands
out
which
makes
the
dryness
such
a
stark
contrast
the
carbonation
forces
a
more
gradual
consumption
which
is
fine
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
no
sense
of
burning
and
little
evidence
in
flavors
enjoyable
a
highly
drinkable
big
belgian
ale
alcohol
and
phenolics
are
present
but
not
overwhelming
the
light
body
and
dry
finish
make
it
very
drinkable
and
very
in
the
style
good
stuff
pours
light
almost
yellow
and
bubbly
with
a
perfectly
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
and
lasts
throughout
the
drink
as
a
thin
layer
of
dust
aromas
of
biscuity
malts
light
candi
sugar
and
sharply
earthy
hops
understated
but
beautiful
on
the
palate
subtlety
is
the
order
of
the
day
very
light
body
here
and
light
alcohol
for
the
style
with
the
flavors
following
suit
some
pear
fruits
come
out
first
followed
by
a
burst
of
sweetness
and
a
snap
of
bitterness
as
the
hops
show
themselves
sharp
carbonation
dry
breadandpepper
finish
that
lasts
just
long
enough
overall
this
is
a
delicate
subtle
triple
with
no
cloying
sweetness
its
wonderful
and
full
of
flavor
nonetheless
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
overly
intense
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
a
belgian
tripel
it
poured
a
nice
golden
body
with
a
thin
1
head
smell
is
of
citrus
and
sugar
the
taste
is
nice
very
sweet
and
citrusy
the
level
of
carbonation
is
good
with
small
but
plentiful
bubbles
i
would
have
this
beer
again
not
undrinkable
but
why
one
would
to
drink
it
d
it
is
very
tasty
probably
will
buy
this
again
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
triple
decent
flavor
not
a
bad
tripel
however
doesnt
really
distinguish
itself
from
others
of
the
style
prolly
not
one
i
would
actively
pursue
or
look
to
have
cheers

paired
excellently
with

with

on

this
is
definitely
a

brew

likely
a
wonderful

this

for
about
1

i
like
this
beer
nothing
is
overpowering
just
smooth
and
drinkable
not
one
of
my
favorite
abbey
tripels
but
i
may
try
to
review
again
at
a
later
time
d
with
a
great
flavor
combination
and
a
satisfying
finish
would
drink
a
few
not
noticing
the
modest
yet
still
formidable
abv
despite
its
being
lower
than
the
average
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
hides
the
abv
pretty
well
with
only
a
couple
of
hints
goes
down
well
drinker
beware
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
this
brew
from
a
large
corked
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
goldenyellow
color
with
a
huge
white
head
very
good
lace
intricate
and
sticky
the
aroma
is
herbal
and
earthy
theres
a
little
peppery
phenols
and
a
rustic
cereal
character
the
yeastiness
is
present
but
not
as
pronounced
as
id
expected
the
brew
is
a
little
dry
with
a
very
herbal
hoppiness
that
presents
a
solid
bitterness
lasting
throughout
the
taste
fairly
high
carbonation
combined
with
a
medium
body
the
finish
is
spicy
and
bitter
very
enjoyable

above

for

but
at

at
the
price
i
paid
for
it
too
expensive
to
want
to
buy
again
this
one
definitely
benefits
from
warming
up
slightly
the
flavor
really
starts
to
take
shape
after
a
few
minutes
in
the
glass
im
sure
my
patience
would
have
been
well
rewarded
i
am
curious
to
know
if
some
unmalted
wheat
was
used
in
brewing
this
ale
i
could
be
completely
off
but
the
haze
mouthfeel
and
nice
head
retention
lead
me
to
suspect
this
might
be
the
case
overall
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
appreciates
hoppier
belgian
golden
ales
and
tripels
that
tend
towards
the
drier
side
recommended
d
a
very
nice
beer
indeed
complex
taste
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
make
this
a
great
drinking
experience
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
generous
head
smell
is
sweet
with
many
spices
involved
the
taste
is
not
as
big
as
i
was
anticipating
it
mostly
consists
of
the
same
spices
and
sweetness
but
there
fails
to
be
any
real
explosion
in
my
mouth
like
traditional
belgian
tripels
this
beer
would
probably
be
alright
if
one
hadnt
tried
a
tripel
before
but
once
youve
had
the
best
of
them
its
not
great
its
like
a
novel
thats
34
great
but
the
author
gets
bored
and
chintzes
on
the
ending
its
not
an
abject
failure
but
it
doesnt
deliver
on
some
fair
upfront
promise
the
crispness
and
sassiness
add
a
refreshing
aura
but
the
abv
parnters
with
the
other
missteps
to
make
you
wonder
if
its
worth
drinking
in
the
future
so
the
bottle
is
finished
and
really
so
is
my
curiosity
about
this
beer
easily
consumable
this
is
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
belgian
world
of
beers
if
you
find
this
enjoyable
youll
likely
find
most
of
them

it
had

i
like
to
drink
belgian
beer
with
no
yeast
at
first
then
add
some
of
the
yeast
from
the
bottle
later
this
is
one
beer
that
tastes
quite
different
with
the
the
yeast
mixed
in
i
dont
think
i
would
know
it
was
the
same
beer
if
the
top
half
and
bottom
half
were
poured
into
two
different

it

an
unfiltered

with
a
finger
of

head
that
leaves
rings
and
sheets
of
lacing
it
smells
spicy
and
phenolic
with
notes
of
lemon
banana
along
with
some
tartness
and
faint
alcohol
the
body
is

to
thick

the
beer
is

rind

apple
wheat
faint
yeast
a
mild
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
not
too
complex
but
still
a
good
highly
drinkable
tripel
eric
i
do
drink
it
and
its
spritzy
very
carbonated
and
tangy
a
little
spicy
as
any
good
wit
should
be
with
a
mild
nutmeggy
cinnamony
flavor
very
refreshing
and
a
great
summertime
beer
much
more
fullbodied
than

which
will
you
give
you
points
with
me

i
could
drink
a
couple
mroe
of
these
and
be
pretty
damn
happy
this
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
giant
white
foamy
head
theres
alot
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
the
smell
has
a
candy
sugar
aroma
along
with
some
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
malt
and
floral
flavors
this
is
very
crisp
with
some
hop
bitterness
the
mf
is
light
with
all
the
flavors
being
well
balanced
this
is
a
good
beer
worth
trying
againnot
the
best
belgian
but
a
good
beer
taste
was
dry
and
malty
a
little
mash
or
hull
taste
not
very
nice
slightly
acidic
and
fruity
again
the
taste
of
honey
i
get
strong
associations
of
honey
and
to
a
lesser
extend
vanilla
starting
to
bore
me
after
a
couple
of
sips
this
beer
is
absolutely
not
bitter
which
would
have
been
great
in
combination
with
the
typical
honey
taste
and
dryness
of
the
beer
how
much
i
would
like
to
give
a
good
review

leave

much

of
citrus

i
cant
put
my

on
a
very
nice
taste
that
consists
of
bubblegum
citrus
with
an
ever
so
slight
hoppy
aftertaste
very
drinkable
beer
no
problem
drinking
750ml
in
one
sitting
all
in
all
a
very
very
enjoyable
beer
from
the
pop
of

the
last
sip
from
my
goblet
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
medium
to
thick
head
smells
strong
of
hops
lemon
fruit
in
general
actually
and
seemed
very
dusty
i
dont
know
if
that
was
just
my
bottle
but
i
detected
it
taste
is
that
of
most
decent
pale
ales
i
have
had
with
some
citrusy
notes
nothing
particularly
special
rather
sour
aftertaste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
rather
carbonated
and
acidic
not
very
pleasent
as
decribed
by
my
girlfriend
tastes
like
i
kinda
acid
refluxed
in
my
mouth
a
very
strange
tripel
not
your
run
of
the
mill
beefylike
hefe
complexingly
uneven
pours
a
translucent
golden
yellow
under
a
fluffy
white
head
with
big
chunks
of
brown
yeast
that
are
circulated
like
a
fountain
from
the
carbonation
in
my
giant
goblet
nose
is
fragrant
tropical
fruit
belgian
yeast
and
fruity
hops
taste
is
more
tropical
fruit
candi
sugar
dry
earthy
yeast
and
aromatic
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
lots
of
elements
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
with
some
tripel
sweetness
alcohol
is
wellhidden
for
7
5
a
tasty
little
tripel
overall
lots
of
action
in
the
mouth
active
and
aggressive
but
not
unpleasant
or
overpowering
goes
down
smoothly
too
quickly
if
youre
not
careful
easy
drinkability
not
heavy
totally
refreshing
crisp
full
of
body
and
personality
it
may
not
be
the
most
unique
of
the
tripels
but
still
a
highquality
beer
drinkability
great
drinkability
for
a
7
5
abv
brew
flavorful
and
refrreshing
its
what
good
beer
is
all
about
if
i
wanted
a
tripel
to
represent
my
fridge
i
would
go
with
this
one
medium
mouth
that
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
not
bad
overall
but
nothing
exciting
either
pretty
easy
to
find
and
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
with
pork
medallions
sauteed
with
green
apples
and
mushrooms
in
a
garlic
demiglace
the
beer
poured
a
light
gold
with
a
white
head
it
was
also
resplendent
with
heavy
sediment
giving
it
a
wonderful
cloudieness
the
aroma
was
of
sharp
malt
the
taste
was
of
malt
with
a
little
yeast
plenty
of
sweet
fruit
and
really
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
feel
was
heavy
and
creamy
it
had
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
with
an
alcohol
burn
a
very
enjoyable
tripel
and
one
i
will
have
to
sample
again
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
that
turns
very
cloudy
after
the
yeast
pour
soap
bubble
head
quickly
fills
the
glass
and
slowly
settles
to
a
very
dense
creamy
head
that
never
quite
vanishes
tiny
streaming
carbonation
does
not
disturb
abundant
patches
of
stubborn
lace
left
behind
belgian
phenolics
and
fruit
aromas
like
peach
and
citrus
pilsener
malt
and
faint
noble
hops
become
apperent
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
first
taste
is
sweet
probably
from
candi
sugar
and
pale
malt
becomes
fruity
but
never
turns
to
ester
the
aftertaste
has
a
german
hop
spice
but
the
gentle
yet
tart
yeast
flavor
stands
out
the
most
the
phenols
compensate
for
the
lack
of
hop
bitterness
and
the
result
is
a
balanced
mouthfeel
that
finishes
with
only
a
whisper
of
yeast
the
crisp
carbonation
and
soft
body
make
it
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
which
sucks
because
its
expensive
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
taste
a
somewhat
fruity
taste
but
still
a
bit
drier
that
i
would
have
thought
a
slight
hoppiness
feels
very
good
in
the
mouth
with
just
a
slight
smoothness
an
interesting
brew
simple
yet
still
flavorful
this
beer
has
a
wellrounded
flavor
and
good
balance
between
the
complex
flavors
and
sweetness
however
the
level
of
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
high
for
me
and
seems
to
overwhelm
the
flavor
apart
from
the
carbonation
this
is
a
farily
subdued
yet
well
balanced
and
complex
tripel
very
palatable
taste
yeast
up
front
with
a
malty
sweetness
to
it
almost
like
a
candied
sugar
distinction
to
it
still
at
the
very
end
theres
a
little
skunkiness
to
it
i
dont
know
if
its
been
in
the
freezer
of
my
distributor
for
too
long
but
its
a
bit
skunky
oh
well
i
can
tell
its
a
decent
tasting
beer
otherwise
but
if
you
want
a
beer
like
this
that
is
less
of
a
sulfruic
mess
go
with
fin
du
monde
the
high
7
5
abv
is
also
well
represented
as
an
after
thought
and
in
the
following
after
taste
notes
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
def
not
my
first
choice
for
the
style
but
good
every
now
and
then
id
definitely
pick
this
as
a
good
tripel
to
introduce
a
shitty
beer
drinker
to
better
beer
as
its
not
overpowering
in
any
sense
but
still
good
and
flavorful

very
good

noticeable
alcohol
character
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
overally
an
enjoyable
tripel
presented
as
a
750ml
bottle
the
release
of
the
cork
was
somewhat
dissapointing
with
only
a
slight
pop
present
poured
a
delightful
golden
color
with
attractive
white
puffy
head
the
smell
was
enjoyable
with
a
nice
fruity
maltiness
taste
was
incredible
with
a
combination
of
malt
spices
fruit
and
citrus
finished
very
smooth
with
a
complex
maltiness
very
drinkable
paired
it
with
barbequed
shrimp
and
scallops
drinks
very
easily
but
also
very
tame
and
shallow
for
an
abbeystyle
tripel
highly
recommended
in
my
book
after
the
corsendonk
brown
i
expected
a
tremendous
beer
out
of
this
one
especially
since
i
am
a
huge
trippel
fan
the
straw
to
yellow
color
is
on
target
nice
carbonation
white
head
and
incredible
retention
and
lacing
aroms
are
subdued
but
nice
fresh
fruits
honey
chardonay
like
mildly
tart
and
perfumy
alcohol
woven
around
peppery
spices
the
taste
was
a
slight
let
down
it
becomes
a
little
too
chardonay
like
less
malty
sweetness
than
i
expected
and
a
lower
body
too
all
of
the
tartness
of
lemons
grapefruit
white
grapes
and
pears
that
i
like
but
lacks
a
bit
of
round
sweetness
going
into
the
body
remains
alcoholic
and
perhaps
a
little
phenolic
i
think
in
their
attempt
for
greater
alcohol
they
lost
body
and
smoothness
still
a
world
class
beer
this
is
most
decidedly
a
good
beer
opinion
i
think
that
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
would
not
kick
it
out
of
the
fridge
i
think
that
the
aroma
was
more
intriguing
than
the
flavor
but
i
am
spoiled
with
belgian
tripels
i
would
put
this
beer
somewhere
in
my
top
10
favorite
tripels
but
i
definitely
like
some
others
more
clear
golden
colour
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
lace
lemon
and
spice
in
the
aroma
quite
clean
same
in
the
flavour
but
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
starts
things
off
a
bit
peppery
as
well
clean
short
finish
with
some
sweetness
huge
crisp
carbonation
with
a
lightish
body
slightly
slick
texture
but
mouthfeel
is
dominated
by
the
carbonation
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
nice
balance
sweet
fruity
with
elements
of
peach
or
nectarine
the
hops
were
subtle
but
prevalent
i
wouldnt
say
this
was
balanced
like
a
german
lager
might
be
but
this
isnt
a
german
lager
its
anything
but
it
reminded
me
of
the
kind
of
beer
you
would
take
with
dessert
and
drink
the
night
away
with
all
that
carbonation
it
felt
awesome
in
the
mouth
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
although
it
was
a
bit
on
the
filling
side
compared
to
its
light
color
and
mouthfeel
probably
all
the
bubbles
id
almost
be
tempted
to
call
this
a
tripel
lite
perhaps
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
this
would
work
but
i
long
for
more
potency
decent
pours
into
the
corsendonk
zalig
genieten
glass
with
explosive
carbonation
in
a
yellowish
gold
body
leading
to
a
thunderously
large
marshmallow
white
head
aromas
fight
through
the
cumulus
head
to
reveal
candied
bananas
pineapple
candy
sugar
yeast
a
touch
of
pepper
not
bad
grainy
fruit
flavors
topped
with
sticky
candy
sugar
alcohol
noticeable
up
front
along
with
some
peppery
mildly
astringent
bitterness
sweetness
stays
into
the
finish
with
a
buttressing
bananaish
bitterness
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
light
syrupy
quality
not
a
bad
tripel
but
there
are
plenty
better
this
beer
popped
loudly
and
poured
a
clear
golden
with
a
billowy
white
head
that
sizzled
down
to
a
thin
layer
not
long
after
the
pour
the
smell
is
good
but
is
lacking
a
little
bit
it
smells
slightly
fruity
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
there
is
an
alcohol
presence
with
the
flavor
it
has
a
light
sweetness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
to
moderate
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
recommend
it
the
mouthfeel
possesses
a
far
more
fizzy
and
carbonated
texture
than
the
appearance
of
this
tripel
initially
belies
in
fact
ive
had
the
impression
this
whole
time
that
ive
been
drinking
a
fullbodied
lager
in
the
back
of
my
mind
perhaps
i
didnt
choose
a
more
exemplar
bottle
of
this
tripel
to
review
but
from
what
ive
sampled
this
doesnt
really
thrill
me
too
much
pretty
plain
overall
a
very
easydrinking
tripel
ill
give
it
that
but
i
dont
feel
very
enticed
to
make
an
extra
trip
for
more
or
to
refill
my
glass
with
it
any
time
soon
finally
a
local
wine
importer
is
distributing
some
new
belgians
in
alberta
corsendonk
among
them
the
bottle
is
quite
a
simple
affair
with
a
small
white
decal
of
mary
corsendonks
brewery
label
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
religiouslooking
an
apple
and
mango
aroma
drifts
up
after
the
cap
is
popped
the
agnus
pours
with
a
mammoth
head
verging
on
uncontrollable
especially
in
the
corsendonk
beer
glass
big
pillowy
and
bright
white
the
head
slowly
falls
to
a
drinkable
level
leaving
clingy
lacing
in
rings
and
big
dense
pockets
all
the
while
churning
melodiously
the
liquid
itself
is
a
cloudy
champagne
colour
bright
golden
the
first
sniff
gives
an
exceptional
tripel
aroma
full
of
spicy
brandy
alcohol
white
sugar
and
a
strong
floral
soapiness
fresh
wet
grass
above
the
rim
and
down
closer
i
get
the
maltiness
along
with
a
rich
honey
smell
which
was
appetising
and
a
little
different
for
a
tripel
the
aroma
is
quite
dusty
warm
and
sweet
some
great
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
adding
pear
peel
green
apple
mango
dried
apricot
and
banana
cake
there
is
a
great
deal
of
complexity
to
be
had
in
the
smell
and
i
found
new
aromas
with
each
sniff
much
better
than
a
lot
of
tripels
out
there
the
taste
does
not
fully
fulfil
the
aroma
but
is
still
first
rate
the
beer
is
quite
syrupy
sweet
and
sugary
but
not
cloying
malt
is
given
priority
and
the
phenols
are
masked
very
well
some
tinny
metallic
tastes
throw
in
an
off
flavour
occasionally
surprising
also
is
the
spicy
hops
this
has
in
the
mouth
even
up
front
on
the
tongue
almost
like
saaz
or
hallertauer
i
tasted
more
hopping
than
usual
for
the
style
the
taste
begins
malty
gristy
and
with
the
flowery
hops
in
the
middle
all
the
fruit
comes
out
a
little
syrupy
but
filled
with
apricot
and
apple
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
little
alcohol
bite
and
decently
bitter
from
the
hops
the
smell
and
taste
both
have
dusty
powdery
characteristics
the
sediment
tasted
separately
is
milky
and
even
more
dusty
i
cannot
complain
about
any
element
of
the
taste
save
the
fact
that
the
aroma
lead
me
to
believe
it
would
be
a
little
better
this
is
medium
bodied
and
low
in
carbonation
allowing
for
easy
sipping
after
a
glass
the
stomach
warms
comfortably
and
you
can
chew
the
cud
as
it
were
of
this
beer
my
verdict
a
great
example
of
the
style
worthy
of
the
name
tripel
and
very
tasty
with
enough
complexity
to
satisfy
most
palates
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
thanks
corsendonk
cheers
my
main
detraction
from
belgian
ales
is
their
phenolic
character
and
this
pleasantly
had
none
except
for
the
price
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
and
would
be
of
great
use
in
advocacy
of
good
beer
to
the
unknowing
it
is
a
nice
blend
of
light
and
flavorful
that
any
beer
drinker
will
be
able

appreciate

just
a

in

but
not

average
tripel
and
not

seek
out
again
the
taste
has
a
bitter

followed
by
a
flush
of
fruit
and
earthy
malt
there
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
way
back
the
finish
is
dry
with
an
earthy

aftertaste
pretty
delicious
with
a
pleasant
fizzy
mouthfeel
zesty
if
i
had
to
keep
it
to
one
word
fruity
nose
and
very
sweet
yet
very
crisp
to
the
taste
not
a
session
beer
but
a
lovely
beverage
none
the
less
carbonation
seams
to
pick
up
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
to
bubbly
for
my
taste
but
then
again
were
talking
about
almost
a
champagne
this
is
definitely
a
beer
for
the
fainter
of
heart
drinkable
in
no
way
a
bad
beer
but
dont
have
to
high
expectations
about
it
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
think
it
would
fare
better
if
it
were
a
bit
stronger
yeasty
smell
a
nice
yeasty
head
for
a
few
minutes
after
the
pour
creamy
smooth
in
the
drink
but
with
metallic
in
the
finish
and
real
metal
and
dry

and
a
spot
of
more
potent

not

story
this
is

7
5
belgian
tripel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
could
this
be
a
great
belgian
session
beer
drinkability
and
overall
this
beer
isnt
perfect
but
its
still
incredibly
enjoyable
not
as
good
as
the
urthel
tripel
i
just
had
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
gets
more
and
more
pleasing
as
i
go
down
the
glass
deifnitly
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
see
it
a
solid
tripel
by
all
accounts
but
there
are
many
other
tripels
on
the
market
that
i
prefer
i
appreciate
tripels
that
can
provide
some
more
complexity
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
nice
straw
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
quite
spicy
for
a
tripel
there
aroma
also
has
hints
of
banana
the
flavor
is
fairly
complex
with
spicy
hops
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
tart
apple
that
is
emphasized
by
the
carbonation
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
a
bit
excessive
for
this
beer
but
not
too
excessive
to
ruin
the
beer
overall
a
bit
of
a
break
from
the
standard
tripel
style
but
still
very
good
taste
a
light
malty
sweetness
upfront
combined
with
something
that
i
had
trouble
putting
my
finger
on
it
could
have
been
anything
from
currants
to
dates
this
sustained
until
the
finish
when
the
bitter
herbal
hops
kicked
in
this
lasted
well
into
the
aftertaste
where
it
was
joined
by
light
sweet
apples
there
was
a
green
grass
component
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
with
just
being
my
3rd
tripple
i
believe
i
should
have
more
to
look
forward
to
from
this
style
at
7
5
this
beer
is
not
quite
a
session
but
in
its
own
family
of
tripels
it
could
be
considered
one
notes
not
much
taste
to
speak
of
i
think
that
this
is
what
can
make
this
beer
appealing
you
wont
blow
your
socks
off
this
is
a
great
belgian
to
warm
up
with
i
disagree
with
the
price
it
is
too
high
for
what
you
get
according
to
the
cork
lot
136287
quite
a
pain
to
get
the
cork
out
pours
a
somewhat
bland
yellow
color
but
has
an
excellent
meaty
white
head
smell
is
quite
excellent
smells
is
of
coriander
and
light
fruit
but
just
appetizing
throughout
taste
is
quite
good
high
in
alcohol
flavor
but
also
wooden
and
oaklike
flavors
spicy
without
hops
perhaps
coriander
and
other
flavors
are
dominant
tasty
and
worth
the
price
i
recommend
it
pours

and
underrated
beer
330ml
bottle
from

into

tulip
glass
revealed
a
hazy
pale
gold
ale
with
a
phenomenal
fluffy
white
cap
that
piled
out

like

active

thousands
of
tiny

bubbles
streaming
up

distinct

pears
spice
and
a
wisp
of
must
from

front
side
is
peppery
from
the
effervescence
but
the
spice
overpowers
it
and
then
comes
some

like
a

cider
finish
is
deceptive
dry
with

fully
cloaked

with
a
touch

not
to
bad
a
nice
bitterness
as
it
warmed
the
flavor
just
got
better
this
lovely
beer
pours
a
sweet
goldish
brown
with
a
nice
giant
head
the
smell
is
of
that
distinct
belgian
barnyard
smell
the
taste
is
kind
of
thin
for
a
tripple
but
it
is
very
good
however
for
the
price
i
would
buy
soething
else
i
also
dont
know
how
long
this
has
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
in
my
week
beer
educated
townstate
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
rounded
fruity
one
that
makes
this
beer
very
enjoyable
a
good
tripel
not
my
favorite
but
a
good
version
nonetheless
pretty
drinkable
since
the
abv
is
rather
low
for
the
style
and
well
hidden
this
beer
comes
across
fresh
and
crisp
mells
good
feels
good
tatses
good
enjoyable
recommended
to
try
nice
straw
yellow
colr
with
a
small
head
bt
great
lacing
smell
is
light
and
grassy
very
light
citrus
undertone
taste
is
subdued
but
pleasant
light
grassy
element
and
a
light
hop
finish
mouthfell
is
somewhat
light
considering
the
abv
but
very
nice
drinkability
likewise
is
good
for
the
abv
pours
a
golden
yellowyorange
color
with
a
frothy
eggshell
white
head
pleasant
aromas
of
pale
malts
and
candi
sugars
on
top
of
a
blood
orangeruby
red
citrusy
aroma
dusty
and
musty
hop
and
yeast
character
too
the
initial
malt
sweetness
is
quickly
cut
with
a
estery
fruitiness
and
then
the
clovey
ginger
phenols
take
form
in
the
finish
leaving
it
dry
and
palatable
carbonation
is
decent
it
is
very
nice
and
drinkable
im
convinced
it
is
better
out
of
the
bottle
than
ondraft
this
is
a
good
tripel
certainly
drinkable
but
my
money
stays
on
chimays
representation
of
the
style
and
the
cost
of
both
means
i
wont
be
back
to
corsendonk
for
some
time
if
the
chimay
runs
out
i
know
where
to
go
beautiful
beer
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
bed
i
caught
myself
licking
my
lips
for
leftovers
would
be
yummy
with
moghul
indian
foods
quite
carbonated
with
large
bubbles
rising
quickly
through
my
glass
the
beer
is
a
gold
color
with
a
light
haze
and
a
head
that
is
made
up
of
large
white
bubbles
which
though
thick
to
begin
with
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
sharp
a
bit
spicy
and
actually
reminiscent
of
a
sauvignon
blanc
in
both
its
fruitiness
and
spiciness
this
beer
effervesces
on
my
tongue
it
is
sharp
up
front
yet
has
a
grapelike
sweetness
in
the
finish
while
there
is
a
certain
sharpness
and
a
hint
of
spiciness
ginger
pepper
and
a
hint
of
clove
this
beer
is
fairly
clean
and
not
all
that
complex
certainly
tasty
but
it
could
use
so
much
more
beer
is
good
happy
abbey
pale
ale
beering
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
if
it
werent
so
expensive
i
would
like
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
good
drinkability
for
this
well
balanced
tripel
yeast
presence
could
have
been
more
prominent
but
this
is
a
fine
sipper
with
a
nice
tropical
fruit
dominance
that
is
enhanced
by
the
floral
hoppiness
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
spicey
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
malts
and
a
fruity
yeast
finish
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
dry
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
fruity
yeast
finish
it
has
a
slight
corriander
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
abbey
pale
ale
it
has
good
aroma
and
decent
flavor
an
above
average
drinker
pours
goldengreenish
with
a
copious
head
that
lingered
for
a
fair
amount
of
time
very
frothy
and
composed
fairly
complex
smell
with
a
lot
of
smokiness
alcohol
and
a
myriad
of
noncitrus
fruits
taste
matched
the
smell
but
was
less
invasive
not
a
well
balanced
ale
a
bit
too
much
smoky
flavor
which
caused
this
very
acrid
taste
it
made
me
cringe
a
little
every
time
i
drank
but
if
you
like
smoky
then
its
great
mouthfeel
was
very
good
it
needed
more
balance
between
flavors
to
really
enjoy
the
taste
this
is
interesting
to
compare
with
the
corsendonk
brown
they
have
some
similar
core
elements
but
go
in
completely
different
directions
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
christmas
ale
i
just
wish
i
knew
why
mine
was
chunky
poured
a
transparent
golden
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
rose
above
the
glass
but
didnt
drop
over
the
edge
smell
is
yeasty
earth
spicy
hint
of
fruit
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
spicy
with
white
pepper
notes
that
follow
a
eerily
empty
opening
there
just
a
brief
hesitation
before
the
flavors
hit
and
then
it
all
overwhelms
the
palate
hint
of
pale
malt
fresh
fruit
bit
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
soothing
very
prickly
from
the
carbonation
mmmm
this
was
a
great
followup
to
the
corsendonk
brown
12
ounce
bottle
pleanty
of
sediment
in
bottle
but
pours
light
pale
and
just
a
little
cloudy
white
head
tiny
bubbles
when
it
settles
and
leaves
intricate
lacing
strong
nose
of
melon
rubber
bands
and
coriander
soft
on
the
tongue
light
to
medium
bodied
spicy
palate
yeast
spice
melons
bubblegum
hops
very
late
crisp
finish
nice
stuff
alot
going
on
7
5
well
in
the
background
a
standard
and
widely
available
belgian
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
a
nice
example
of
the
belgian
abbey
ale
style
although
the
alcohol
is
pretty
strong
7
5
abv
it
was
not
noticeable
in
either
smell
or
taste
overall
impression
definitely
one
of
the
better
massproduced
abbey
ales
it
is
actually
botte
conditioned
as
opposed
to
grimbergen
or
leffe
a
bit
too
gassy
though
not
much
complexity
corsendonk
pater
is
definitely
better
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
cork
came
out
easy
but
with
a
huge
pop
i
am
fortunate
to
have
a
corsendonk
glass
to
sample
this
beer
from
pours
out
much
lighter
in
color
than
i
expected
its
about
the
same
yellow
as
most
lagers
two
inch
bright
white
head
and
very
effervesant
the
smell
is
sweet
banana
and
yeast
taste
is
similar
but
with
more
spice
nice
alcohol
warming
at
the
end
not
extremely
complex
but
very
easy
drinking
lighter
than
most
tripels
that
i
have
had
not
a
bad
drink
but
certainly
others
from
its
class
i
would
chose
over
this
one
next
time
nice
looking
beer
a
mediumsized
white
fine
head
that
leaves
soapy
lacing
a
dark
gold
clear
slightly
orangey
body
sugar
and
spice
and
citrus
in
the
nose
this
is
what
clouds
smell
like
in
heaven
i
think
a
malty
fruity
peppery
front
thick
buttery
foamy
smooth
silky
malt
middle
dry
spicy
yeasty
finish
that
lets
a
little
too
much
alcohol
through
when
cool
i
like
this
beer
its
a
nice
sweet
fruity
buttery
pale
belgian
i
liked
the
way
this
version
of
an
abbey
tripel
tasted
and
smelled
it
was
a
nice
brew
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
sometime
soon
well
maybe
not
as
revolutionary
as
its
brother
the
brown
ale
but
still
a
solid
tripel
and
one
id
likely
have
again
this
is
the
first
abbey
tripel
ive
tried
and
i
must
say
i
really
love
this
stuff
poured
out
a
light
orangegolden
color
smell
is
a
little
hoppy
and
some
hints
of
citrus
in
it
taste
is
quite
soft
on
the
palate
you
can
taste
that
citrus
but
also
some
notes
of
alcohol
in
it
that
kinda
drives
down
to
the
aftertaste
but
its
not
too
bad
its
quite
tolerable
i
like
it
its
good
gold
in
color
with
a
decent
head
that
produced
some
light
lacing
the
aroma
was
mild
sweetness
and
spice
detected
the
flavor
was
sweet
and
was
nicely
balanced
with
spice
and
decent
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
the
spices
and
malt
rode
the
tongue
well
after
swallowing
the
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
nice
carbonation
levels
not
the
best
abbey
triple
but
a
drinkable
version
comments

i
have
found
that
my
preferences
with
this
particular
style
stray
a
little
bit
from
the
norm
where
as
this
one
is
running
a
3
8
or
so
average
i
thought
it
was
much
better
very
cloudy
with
a
good
amount
of
sediment
there
was
not
much
of
a
head
but
decent
lacing
hints
of
honey
and
malt
in
the
aroma
there
is
a
burnt
sugar
taste
that
turns
dry
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
lacking
a
few
things
there
is
very
little
carbonation
and
the
taste
isnt
well
balanced
i
just
had
a
karmeliet
tripel
last
night
and
this
one
is
definately
not
in
the
same
league
but
it
is
not
a
terrible
brew
drinkability
is
good
but
this
is
a
different
brew
a
belgian
classic
and
a
great
pairing
with
rich
or
spicey
foods

as
some
tripel
and
tripel
style
beers
i
have
had
it
seems
to
vacillate
between
golden
ale
and
tripel
a
bit
it
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
but
just
not
as
much
going
on
as
i
woudl
have
hoped
for
this
is
one
beer
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
from
a

an

it

incredible
a
session
brew
if
you
can
afford
it
at
7
bucks
a
pop
i
will
side
with
an
american
micro
but
this
is
very
tasty
and
incredibly
drinkable
overall
a
very
nice
drinking
tripel
with
less
character
than
its
more
classic
cousins
source
liquid
solutions
not
a
bad
brew
that
tends
to
be
sold
at
just
about
every
store
i
walk
into
makes
for
a
good
choice
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
belgian
and
cant
seem
to
find
one
of
the
better
less
readily
available
tripels
lacking
in
depth
for
a
tripel
a
bit
on
the
dryside
with
some
pearlike
fruit
flavors
and
sourish
malt
with
a
bit
of
clove
phenols
lacked
the
layers
of
fruityness
or
spice
that
i
look
for
in
a
tripel
pleasant
and
drinkable
but
not
something
that
i
would
search
out
in
the
future
truly
an
amazing
beer
in
my
top
20
for
sure
a
lawnmower
tripel
perhaps
and
a
nice
one
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
great
it
isnt
the
most
complex
belgian
but
it
stills
tastes
really
good
it
has
a
light
golden
color
with
an
enormous
head
very
carbonated
the
smell
is
of
sour
apples
taste
gives
me
an
alcohol
precense
right
away
which
combines
with
a
citric
hop
flavor
that
id
say
resembles
peach
there
are
some
malts
noticed
in
the
middle
but
they
come
and
go
quickly
this
beer
finishes
nicely
with
a
mild
spicy
yeast
flavor
simply
a
quality
beer
to
drink
a
soft
orangish
straw
color
with
chill
haze
topped
by
an
average
head
fed
by
some
active
carbonation
smell
dominated
by
hohum
grains
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
given
the
lackluster
smell
and
the
first
flavor
that
hit
me
a
dusty
metallic
taste
i
suspect
the
bottle
i
had
was
too
old
still
the
flavor
wasnt
badjust
less
interesting
than
other
tripels
i
have
had
a
fruity
peachy
flavor
that
is
balanced
by
crisp
hoppiness
a
bit
warm
and
dry
at
the
finish
pleasantly
soft
mouthfeel

good
drinkability

oh
i
guess
thats
what
it
is
i
guess
obviousness
doesnt
earn
a
penalty
at
least
its
good
grain
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
sourness
based
on
what
i
smelled
again
lack
of
sour
might
sound
good
to
most
people
have
you
tasted
a
margerita
at
a
bar
or
restaurant
lately
youll
need
more
than
a
wedge
of
lime
floating
in
it
but
who
am
i
to
judge
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
medium
head
and
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
smells
strongly
of
wheat
and
spices
with
some
malts
in
the
background
the
flavor
was
very
yeasty
with
some
citrus
notes
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
wheat
i
guess
that
i
would
have
liked
this
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
has
almost
a
champagnelike
fizziness
that
i
just
didnt
like
i
wasnt
too
impressed
i
must
say
however
that
i
couldnt

with
a
rather
short
head
for
a
belgian
beer
i
was
watching

pour
it
and
it
was
very
foamy

the

died
down
almost
immediately

mildly
sour
with
plenty
of

goodness
and
a

taste
is
very
nice
although
not
the
best
belgian
ive
had
by
a

lots
of
candi

this
is
one
of
the
most
ubiquitous
belgians
in
my
area
bottle
wise
i
was
meaning
to
try
it
when
i
was
first
discovering
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
ive
tried
so
many
other
belgian
abbey
style
ales
that
this
one
just
didnt
really
impress
me
something
about
it
was
just
a
little
off
good
but
with
a
sort
of
unrefined
quality
or
something
i
cant
explain
it
but
it
certainly
wasnt
as
good
as
some
other
tripels
served
in
a
goblet
hazy
honey
color

a
thin
white
head
of
tiny
bubbles
resting
on

a

to

drinkable
nice

pour
with
a
good

large
bubbles
it
has
that
light
yelloworange
color
with
yeast
floating
in
it
as
is
typical
of
the
abbey
pale
ales
i
have
tried
the
head
died
out
and
left
no
lacing
before
i
could
even
take
my
first
sip
its
aroma
mild
and
fruity
the
initial
taste
was
a
mild
and
fruity
with
a
strong
carbonation
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
on
subsequent
tastes
i
began
to
feel
the
carbonation
filling
up
in
my
stomach
a
nice
brew
but
the
chimays
are
better
gf
said
it
was
nice
and
gave
it
a
rating
of
3
65
better
than
the
coffee
brews
lol
well
my
2
local
packies
carry
corsendonk
as
well
as
the
nearest
beer
bar
and
let
me
tell
you
good
belgian
beer
doesnt
exactly
grow
on
trees
around
here
but
for
some
unknown
reason
i
have
resisted
it
until
now
cheaper
than
your
typical
topshelf
belgian
and
the
compromise
is
apparent
in
the
brew
if
you
search
really
hard
some
eurolager
characteristics
offflavors
too
such
as
corn
husk
a
la
heineken
and
stella
which
are
definitely
not
welcome
in
a
belgian
tripel
however
there
are
some
very
nice
things
going
on
here
as
well
smoother
than
many
tripels
with
more
emphasis
on
the
pale
malts
some
shimmering
hoppiness
and
not
too
much
yeast
or
peppery
spiciness
that
is
a
good
thing
an
entrylevel
belgian
tripel
if
there
ever
was
such
a
thing
a
tart
apple
quality
is
lively
and
refreshing
some
white
winelike
woody
elements
will
put
the
oenephiles
at
ease
seasoned
beer
drinkers
will
find
some
things
to
enjoy
here
but
ultimately
the
beer
is
onedimensional
and
you
will
probably
be
left
longing
for
something
to
really
knock
your
socks
off
this
is
a
good
beer
its
not
my
favorite
of
the
belgians
but
even
a
mediore
belgian
beer
and
this
is
far
better
than
mediocre
is
still
damn
good
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
blonde
that
gives
way
to
a
thick
and
boisterous
head
that
is
lively
and
long
lived
the
bubbles
settle
out
by
getting
larger
and
lumpy
the
beer
itself
is
highly
carbonated
i
bounced
the
cork
all
the
way
across
the
kitchen
the
nose
is
moderate
to
weak
giving
off
citrus
fruit
and
spicy
hops
the
taste
is
also
a
citruslemony
flavor
followed
by
a
mild
dose
of
aggressive
hops
that
are
very
bitter
but
in
moderation
all
the
while
being
supported
by
fruity
malt
undertones
the
flavors
are
exceptionally
well
balanced
and
this
is
almost
a
perfect
beer
i
would
prefer
some
more
nose
and
more
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
otherwise
it
is
a
perfect
flavor
and
texture
drinkability
easily
quaffed
but
not
necessarily
something
that
will
hook
your
lips
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
but
as
others
have
said
it
does
not
bring
a
lot
to
the
table
compared
to
others
as
far
as
flavor
and
complexity
it
is
a
very
easy
drinker
very
light
and
palatable
i
drank
this
from
a
large
chalice
it
was
a
golden
amber
in
color
with
aromas
of
hops
and
spice
flavors
of
yeast
mild
hops
and
citrus
fruits
are
present
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
unoffensive
in
every
way
very
little
alcohol
presence
in
both
smell
and
taste
i
give
this
one
a
high
drinkability
because
i
could
and
would
drink
many
in
a
row
however
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
could
be
the
middleweight
champion
of
triples
looks
good
tastes
good
smells
good
goes
down
real
easy
just
not
quite
in
the
same
league
imho
as
my
absolute
favorite
belgian
ales
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
nice
size
head
but
not
huge
like
some
smooth
not
overly
sweet
nothing
offputting
and
certainly
worldclass
head
to
head
would
lose
to
duvel
delirium
unibroues
similar
offeringsetc
but
would
do
just
fine
any
time
taste
the
taste
was
aged
i
think
of
oak
not
to
strong
but
a
slight
hint
is
present
malt
and
hops
are
present
nothing
is
too
over
powering
a
nice
balance
of
the
two
this
is
a
very
very
nice
beer
i
could
enjoy
this
with
moderation
through
the
entire
evening
this
is
one
i
would
like
to
cellar
for
a
few
years
a
must
for
all
to
try
this
ale
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
modest
white
foam
that
settled
to
give
a
thin
coat
on
the
surface
the
smell
was
very
modest
a
faint
musty
grape
and
oak
aroma
the
taste
was
musty
grapes
oak
and
some
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
crisp
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
this
ale
was
not
bursting
with
flavors
but
it
was
very
pleasan
to
drink
well
carbonated
and
creamy
it
is
a
decent
tripel
but
i
found
it
somewhat
bland
there
are
much
better
offerings
out
there
especially
at
this
price
poured
a
light
yellowgolden
amber
with
a
nice
white
tight
foam
that
disapated
after
a
few
seconds
the
smell
was
of
a
floral
and
citrus
aroma
the
taste
was
of
a
citrus
nature
and
a
hint
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
sort
of
sweet
champagne
finish
not
to
sweet
but
not
to
bitter
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
the
more
you
drink
the
better
tasting
it
gets
overall
there
are
better
belgian
style
triples
but
i
have
also
had
worse
ones
the
best
part
of
this
ale
is
the
yeast
which
has
a
wonderful
floral
and
citrus
bouquet
i
use
the
yeast
in
my
homebrew
a
lot
i
remember
this
ale
being
much
better
years
ago
i
have
heard
that
it
is
now
contract
brewed
which
would
explain
a
lot
sampled
a
750
ml
bottle
the
cork
popped
out
like
it
was
champange
but
the
beer
didnt
froth
out
of
the
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
huge
head
which
lasted
quite
well
in
spite
of
the
way
that
it
poured
the
carbonation
was
not
excesive
fruity
flavors
with
a
hoppy
almost
metallic
after
taste
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
pour
is
a
bit
murky
amber
color
with
an
enormous
head
frothy
in
texture
beige
in
color
and
the
lace
thick
clinging
sheets
nose
is
hop
floral
malt
sweet
and
quite
a
pleasure
to
sniff
with
the
old
hooter
malt
sweet
at
the
front
with
a
middling
top
and
the
finish
pleasantly
hopped
with
a
pertinent
acidity
dry
long
lasting
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
and
most
certainly
a
quaffable
beer
pours
a
yellowish
golden
color
with
an
orange
cast
slightly
hazy
the
head
is
firm
and
creamy
starting
at
a
good
inch
or
so
but
eventually
dropping
to
a
thin
116
covering
exceptional
hold
and
very
nice
lace
streams
of
tiny
rising
bubbles
add
to
the
appearance
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
gentle
caress
on
the
tongue
from
the
very
fine
and
effervescent
carbonation
the
aroma
offers
a
soft
candyish
malt
with
some
light
vanilla
notes
a
mild
peppery
spiciness
some
yeast
and
a
very
mild
plasticsmoke
phenolic
very
soft
and
inviting
the
flavor
starts
with
a
sweet
and
lightly
peppery
maltiness
reveals
more
honeyish
and
vanilla
notes
becomes
yeasty
with
some
hoppiness
leading
to
a
drying
finish
with
lingering
malt
and
spice
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
most
likely
adds
to
the
peppery
spiciness
surprisingly
complex
and
exceptionally
drinkable
a
very
poor
beer
save
your
money
and
spend
it
on
something
worthwhile
like
tictacs
i
enjoy
this
but
not
as
a
regular
selection
or
session
beer
it
is
a
bit
slightly
on
the
acquired
taste
side
hazy

sutble
estery

yeasty
undertones
are
present
contributing
some
breadiness
in
addition
to
a
reserved

quite
a
nice
tripel
though
a
bit
less
complex
than
most
in
the
style

abv
this
brew
just
didnt
impress
me
poured
with
almost
no
head
and
was
very
light
looking
almost
clear
it
had
more
of
a
smell
than
aroma
imo
sort
of
skunky
and
it
didnt
remind
me
of
any
pale
i
had
ever
tried
but
the
worst
thing
about
the
beer
was
the
awful
after
taste
the
first
belgian
that
i
have
tried
that
i
wont
drink
again

the

and

of
this

are

me

i
could
point
out

in

its

with
a

throughout
although
the

quickly
dissipates
the
nose
is
sweet
and
spicy
and
it
goes
into
the
flavor
followed
by
some
fruitiness
peach
citrus
the
spiciness
is
almost
too
strong
though
notes
one
of
the
more
drinkable
yet
tame
and
less
complex
imported
tripels
still
flavourful
and
very
deceiving
for
its
potency
though
not
as
boisterous
or
flamboyant
as
other
tripels
can
be
i
decided
the
other
day
to
try
this
on
tap
being
that
i
have
only
had
it
in
bottles
what
a
difference
fresh
and
inviting
you
could
smell
the
flowery
and
fruity
esters
rising
out
of
the
glass
very
appealing
to
look
at
light
and
with
a
delicate
white
head
taste
was
outstanding
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
slight
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
richness
of
the
pale
ale
a
nicely
textured
beer
to
drink
all
year
round
too
much
bourbon
flavor
for
my
taste
floral
smell
as
its
being
poured
with
a
lot
of
small
bubbles
resembling
soap
suds
even
with
a
slightly
slow
pour
very
effervescent
mouthfeel
like
champagne
accompanied
by
a
fruity
flavor
i
recall
from
other
tripels
im
not
overly
familiar
with
this
style
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
after
swallowing
with
a
tart
flavor
which
gives
way
to
a
subtle
bourbon
flavor
nice
complexity
to
this
beer
and
overall
enjoyable
but
a
bit
too
much
of
the
dryness
in
my
opinion
this
had
too
much
bourbon
for
me
if
you
go
for
the
bcbs
type
stouts
then
you
will
love
this
this
is
what
a
barrel
aged
beer
should
be
not
overpowered
by
booze
theres
a
hint
but
this
is
such
an
outstanding
brew
highly
recommended
the
smell
is
very
subtle
not
significant
in
any
way
but
certainly
pleasant
hints
of
vanilla
bean
and
oak
aging
taste
is
on
point
of
the
tripel
style
smooth
up
front
taste
of
vanilla
coconut
and
light
hints
of
the
bourbon
oak
aging
that
follow
through
on
the
back
end
of
the
palate
overall
a
delicate
and
fine
tripel
however
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pay
18
a
bottle
again
i
was
once
in
love
with
the
tripel
style
but
think
i
am
more
so
a
fan
of
strong
belgian
golds
and
darks
now
from
the
tap
at
steins
beer
garden
in
mountainview
ca
nice
lacing
in
the

bourbon
notes
in
the
smell
taste
and
mouth
feel
packs
a
punch
at
11
pineapple
esters
i
smell
them
but
tastewise
this
is
a
classic
belgian
ale
dry
with
perceived
sweetness
and
fruitynees
this
is
great
the
barrel
aging
is
somewhat
subtle
a
well
executed
beer
i
think
the
pineapple
notes
are
most
likely
a
result
of
the
barrel
character
merging
with
the
yeast
byproducts
a
big
sipper
nice
full
creamy
mouth
fair
amount
of
citrus
flavors
slightly
dry
barrel
flavors
mild
but
well
integrated
with
other
flavors
a
belgian
tripel
in
a
distinctly
american
style
a
great
fireside
beer
great
color
great
head
and
retention
re
flavor
that
distinct
belgian
yeast
but
none
of
that
overpowering
banana
esters
ok
maybe
a
little
the
oakaging
is
subtle
but
works
hazy
honeyorange
color
with
a
fingers
white

orange
tropical
fruit
a
little
banana
and
some
peppery
notes
in
the

smooth
flavor
with
prominent
bourbon
and
oak
taste
and
the
same
fruits
in
the
smell
with
a
small
alcohol
kick
creamy
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
a
spicy
pop
pretty
interesting
overall
but
im
not
sure
of
bourbonbarrel
aging
is
what
i
want
in
a
tripel
pleasant
enough
just
not
good
value
at
all
would
rather
have
a
fin
du
monde
or
westmalle
tripel
for
half
the
price
or
less
it
tastes
just
like
a
great
trappist
with
an
oak
and
bourbon
aftertaste
two
completely
different
tastes
that
somehow
balance
each
other
out
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
but
ill
thoroughly
enjoy
that
one
very
strong
fruity
taste
orange
an
citrus
this
is
an
amazing
experience
best
beer
ive
had
sometimes
looks
can
be
deceiving
when
poured
this
looks
like
any
other
triple
although
its
nice
bouquet
of
citrus
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
flavour
is
where
this
brew
really
hits
home
for
me
it
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
tripel
but
with
some
extra
refinement
perhaps
this
is
where
the
barrel
aging
pays
dividence
the
usual
notes
are
balanced
by
a
sweetness
and
only
the
sligthest
notes
of
a
barrel
finish
are
present
this
brew
is
silky
smooth
and
hides
its
abv
dangerously
well
overall
major
disappointment
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
i
expected
something
great
when
i
bought
this
and
it
didnt
disappoint
curieux
pours
a
beautiful
golden
brown
and
smells
like
citrus
and
oak
how
does
it
taste
like
scotch
if
scotch
could
be
beer
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
thats
followed
by
somewhat
of
a
creamy
finish
but
after
youve
swallowed
it
it
has
oaky
notes
that
make
you
think
you
just
had
a
sip
of
scotch
absolutely
fantastic
stuff
its
good
i
mean
im
a
whiskey
drinker
so
i
expect
a
little
more
boozy
taste
of
bourbon
but
let
me
tell
you
its
soooo
smooth
im
glad
i
bought
it
and
at
11
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
allagash
did
very
well
with
this
brew
and
i
cant
say
nothing
bad
about
this
amazing
brew
if
youre
reading
this
deciding
on
buying
it
or
not
put
your
phone
down
and
go
try
it
it
wont
disappoint
overall
excellent
tripel
however
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
that
it
is
barrel
aged
if
i
wasnt
told
however
i
think
the
barrel
here
mostly
serves
to
mellow
out
some
of
the
stronger
flavors
and
bring
harmony
to
everything
so
maybe
the
barrel
not
being
obvious
is
a
good
thing
and
shows
some
real
benefit
rather
than
a
hot
boozy
mess
that
tastes
like
weak
bourbon
the
bottle
was
about
a
year
old
and
tasted
like
old
beer
as
well
it
states
drink
within
a
year
though
triples
are
really
my
thing
anyway
to
date
the
best
barrel
aged
ale
ive
had
great
taste
feel
and
good
smell
750ml
bottle
shared
in
wine
glasses
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
some

aroma
is
of
coconut
alcohol
vanilla
wood
spices
and
some

taste
is

bitter

light

thin
texture
soft
active
carbonation
dry
finish
im
going
to
skip
describing
every
category
in
the
rating
here
and
just
say
wow
best
beer
ive
ever
had
period
absolutely
love
it
smooth
taste
great
flavor
draft
pours
an
opaque
golden
brown
much
like
a
water
downed
jim
beam
and
ginger
full
finger
of
head
that
quickly
dissipates
little
lacing
as
you
drink
you
can
smell
hints
of
bourbon
whiskey
definitely
not
kentucky
straight
bourbon
which
makes
this
fall
flat
tastes
like
a
water
downed
lynchburg
lemonade
i
have
a
head
cold
though
not
picking
up
much
other
than
mild
and
just
nasty
in
my
book
jim
beam
had
to
chug
a
bottle
of
it
to
be
initiated
into
my
fraternity
bringing
back
bad
memories
mild
and
drinkable
smooth
almost
clean
finish
abv
isnt
noticeable
although
it
is

is
really
thin
probably
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
particularly
exciting
on
a
cold
rainy
winter
day
i
only
taste
a
hint
of
vanilla
or
coconut
but
i
do
have
a
head
cold
grew
on
me
more
as
i
finished
the
glass
or
maybe
that
was
just
the
abv
kicking
in
ill
revisit
later
excellent
recommend
it
and
will
have
it
again
i
liked
it
but
i
prefer
a
regular
tripel
for
what
it
is
i
dont
think
everything
needs
to
be
bourbon
barrel
aged
these
days
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
2007
vintage
from
the
beerchives
slightly
oxidized
but
the
oak
and
bourbon
still
shines
through
2007
dark
gold
amber
hue
honeysuckle
with
hints
of
vanilla
fleeting
finish
thats
slightly
tart
not
bad
for
6
years
in
the
keg
mild
bourbon
flavor
balanced
perfectly
with
belgian
yeast
fruit
notes
very
long
flavor
oak
notes
overpower
much
of
the
belgian
triple
notes
sadly
requires
more
balance
to
be
world
class
absolutely
the
very
best
and
most
well
done
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
what
is
already
a
solid
tripel
in
its
own
right
is
made
better
by
the
barrel
aging
the
bourbon
flavors
are
there
but
take
a
nice
subtle
backseat
approach
not
hot
enough
to
burn
and
yet
present
enough
to
notice
very
nice
the
case
can
certainly
be
made
that
allagash
brews
the
very
best
examples
of
belgian
beers
in
america
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
at
least
a
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
that
of
a
typical
tripel
bananas
oranges
coriander
peppery
with
unfortunately
little
to
no
barrel
prescence
taste
is
very
similar
to
most
other
belgians
but
has
a
little
something
extra
solid
beer
but
nothing
overly
impressive
as
i
was
slightly
let
down
based
on
the
other
reviews
here
and
left
feeling
underwhelmed
silky
smooth
and
refreshing
outstanding
incredible
flavorful
and
tasty
also
goes
down
real
smooth
o
even
though
its
not
supposed
to
be
there
i
definitely
get
the
impression
of
brett
yeast
which
i
like
appears
to
be
character
from
the
barrels
and
the
bourbon
previously
contained
within
either
way
very
complex
a
lot
of
layers
of
aroma
and
flavor
and
matches
well
with
some
savory
foods
excellent
boom
went
my
taste
buds
this
is
a
heck
of
a
beer
hard
to
beat
tripel
excellent
complexity
and
wonderfully
balanced
quite
flexible
very
drinkable
or
great
sipper
new
reviewer
new
taste
for
me
i
like
smoothest
highest
abv
this
curieux
has
great
taste
and
the
strength
that
i
desire
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
every
had
its
always
a
treat
when
i
get
a
taste
of
this
sneaky
a
very
sneaky
beer
o
delicious
and
complex
great
sipper
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
over
the
years
but
have
been
hesitant
to
buy
a
bottle
due
to
the
increase
in
price
its
probably
the
first
barrel
aged
beer
i
had
years
ago
it
was
a
treat
to
have
ontap
and
affordable
as
well
great
stuff
sweet
slightly
boozy
crisp
and
possessing
an
interesting
complexity
curieux
is
a
winner
im
thinking
4
25
sets
the
standard
for
bourbon
barrel
beer
complex
notes
and
clean
finish
creamy
oak
flavors
vanilla
and
whiskey
behind
a
solid
base
tripel
light
fruit
notes
so
smooth
and
perfectly
balanced
wow
best
tripel
in
so
time
super
smooth
for
11
would
give
any
trappist
a
run
for
flavor
remarkable
beer
the
oak
barrels
really
shined
through
on
this
beautiful
straw
color
with
a
great
head
of
creamy
foam
intense
vanilla
and
belgian
yeast
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
is
an
amazing
balance
of
banana
hop
bourbon
and
something
peppery
wow
wow
oh
my
gosh
light
sweet
honey
hops
yep
this
beer
has
it
all
going
on
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
this
one
dont
pass
it
up
i
liked
it
good
taste
but
stronger
in
abv
than
i
realized
drinkability
nice
for
11abv
perhaps
a
bit
flat
overall
another
wonderful
brew
from
allagash
who
is
perhaps
the
best
american
made
belgian
style
brewer
a
spendy
proposition
but
glad
i
took
the
plunge
buttery
malts
caramel
hints
of
spice
and
warming
bourbon
evolving
slowly
on
the
palate
in
a
very
pleasant
way
also
a
wooden
note
comes
up
body
by
itself
isnt
too
huge
despite
the
unique
mix
of
flavors
that
leaves
some
space
for
mild
belgium
yeast
to
smooth
out
the
mouthfeel
long
yeast
finish
with
an
underlying
touch
of
bourbon
had
this
just
an
hour
or
so
ago
ontap
at
the
bier
haus
in
savannah
ga
it
was
wonderful
and
not
like
anything
ive
had
before
had
a
great
taste
with
a
little
bourbon
flavoring
and
was
smooth
as
silk
until
i
almost
licked
the
glass
clean
maybe
i
will
get
a
few
of
the
bombers
when
i
see
them
delicious
poured
into
tulips
and
shared
a
hazy
pinkishstraw
color
with
a
pure
white
head
whiskey
on
the
nose
with
vanilla
white
wine
and
raisin
tastes
delicious
with
whiskey
wine
oak
raisin
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
very
nicely
done
this
is
worth
repeating
unbelievable
this
beer
is
11
abv
great
barrel
aged
beer
sweeter
then
i
would
have
thought
but
thats
what
i
get
from
assuming
im
of
2
minds
here
its
notable
but
not
memorable
had
it
at
allagash
on
a
trip
a
few
weeks
ago
as
we
do
not
get
allagash
in
colorado
wonderful
effervescent
and
lightcitrusy
but
with
a
wellbalanced
backbone
of
bourbon
barrel
taste
just
an
incredibly
balanced
beer
if
only
they
all
could
be
like
this
one
this
bad
guy
has
been
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
6
months
since
buying
it
at
allagash
never
seems
to
be
a
good
time
to
drink
a
large
bottle
of
11
beer
by
mtwelfth
what
the
hell
i
may
as
well
ruin
everyones
weekend
and
drink
it
tonight
wow
the
smell
is
overpowering
a
bit
of
an
orangish
intro
as
you
drink
it
but
there
is
a
bit
of
an
odd
odor
maybe
this
is
too
old
now
great
soothing
that
though
can
see
this
being
great
on
a
cold
night
very
yeasty
bomb
that
is
nice
but
not
sure
i
get
a
ton
of
bourbon
out
of
this
11
bit
too
much
for
me
i
love
allagash
but
this
isnt
for
me
hints
of
bourbon
is
correct
at
least
with
this
bottle
would
have
liked
a
more
pronounced
bourbon
influence
but
that
may
be
bottle
specific
too
only
thing
that
detracted
from
my
giving
it
a
perfect
score
bottled
december
2011
consumed
nye
2013
done
side
by
side
with
a
fresh
bottle
major
improvement
with
the
aged
bottle
the
beer
is
more
well
balanced
with
the
bourbon
i
would
never
complain
about
curieux
its
one
if
my
favorite
beers
and
a
local
classic
but
compared
to
the
2011
it
was
sweeter
and
more
pronounced
the
qualities
of
the
triple
and
the
bourbon
are
well
blended
to
form
a
real
classic
pleasant
vanilla
and
bourbon
blend
with
a
little
kick
le
petit
jésus
en
culotte

velours
smooth
creamy
coconut
and
vanilla
very
si
the
but
present
tasty
brew
to
have
with
dinner
o
intense
to
say
the
least
if
oak
is
your
thing
here
is
your
beer
if
you
shy
from
harsh
wood
and
alcohol
notes
be
warned
o
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
most
balanced
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
qualities
in
this
beer
are
perfect
it
is
not
lacking
in
any
category
at
24
a
bottle
the
experience
is
definitely
worth
it
i
find
this
to
be
one
of
the
absolute
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
enjoy
slightly
chilled
for
better
flavor
o
i
would
have
this
on
a
semiregular
basis
if
possible
just
outstanding
easily
the
best
tripel
ive
had
but
still
not
a
truly
great
beer
it
was
extra
creamy
and
had
a
different
taste
than
most
belgians
ive
had
but
not
boozy
at
all
i
heard
great
things
about
this
beer
i
was
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
beer
and
bought
belgian
ale
glass
just
for
this
poured
from
750ml
bottle
the
appearance
is
something
in
between
lager
and
pale
ale
the
nose
is
not
as
bad
as
the
taste
this
beer
is
something
of
cross
between
berliner
weise
pilsner
and
belgian
ale
i
am
not
sure
that
the
fuss
is
about
it
its
over
hyped
over
priced
there
so
many
pother
great
beers
from
firestone
and
stone
brewery
thanks
to
treyliff
for
this
one
o
excellent
brew
was
questioning
it
on
the
nose
but
overwhelmed
on
the
flavor
bought
at
greenlife
asheville
drank
on
the
beach
at
deerfield
beach
fl
july
17th
2014
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
by
good
flavors
and
aromas
im
a
little
surprised
this
only
spent
8
weeks
in
a
barrel
and
was
blended
with
fresh
triple
lots
of
barrel
and
something
id
want
to
try
again
down
the
road
o
not
as
potent
as
i
expected
but
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
were
extremely
smooth
and
balanced
there
is
a
flavorful
touch
of
bourbon
but
i
wish
they
would
have
blended
a
little
less
fresh
tripel
into
the
recipe
help
up
will
with
age
though
and
definitely
drinks
well
o
mellow
beer
for
a
calm
evening
ideal
for
the
fallearly
winter
not
my
favorite
but
a
quality
beer
nonetheless

the

im
very
impressed
on
how
flavorful
this

is

yet
it
is
delicate
at
the

time
a
lovely
combo
balanced

the

the

are
just

this
brew
is

the
style
highly

well
done
allagash
you
brewed
a
beer
that
hid
all
its
alcohol
in
less
than
6
months
and
hid
its
bottling
date
in
plain
sight
overall
i
expected
more
bourbon
flavor
to
come
through
it
was
not
as
noticeable
as
other
bourbon
barrel
ales
ive
tried
still
overall
an
enjoyable
drink
not
sure
it
was
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
but
looking
forward
to
trying
the
second
bottle
in
a
year
or
so
because
the
bourbon
wasnt
apparent
next
time
ill
save
half
the
and
get
a
plain
allagash
tripel
750
ml
bottle
good
lacing
on
the
glass
great
mouthful
no
overwhelming
or
overpowering
in
the
mouth
taste
is
somewhat
like
an
english
old
ale
light
smells
of
carmel
cloudy
appearance
a
great
beer
with
great
taste
goes
down
well
with
no
after
taste
and
will
wreck
your
palate
id
rate
it
higher
for
an
english
old
ale
than
a
tripel
dang
i
shared
a
bottle
of
this
with
my
brother
in
honor
of
my
thirtieth
birthday
and
have
only
positive
praise
for
it
we
paired
it
with
homemade
huaraches
and
if
youve
never
tried
turning
ground
corn
into
tortillas
ill
tell
you
that
all
it
takes
is
a
little
bit
of
water
and
a
fork
and
fueling
your
efforts
with
sips
of
curieux
isnt
a
bad
way
to
go
either
it
packs
an
amazing
wallop
without
ever
being
in
your
face
or
overbearing
just
an
enjoyable
experience
from
feather
to
feather
from
sip
to
sip
sit
back
and
settle
your
eyes
out
on
that
pod
of
dolphins
passing
by
its
summertime
enjoy
all
the
moments
o
a
nice
belgian
style
ale
i
dont
imagine
it
spent
very
much
time
at
all
in
the
bourbon
barrels
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
it
was
worth
trying
once
o
i
think
this
beer
could
grow
on
me
the
bourbon
does
not
overpower
the
beer
as
much
as
some
the
abv
is
also
pretty
well
hidden
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
overall
i
think
the
balance
of
the
flavors
is
superb
even
if
the
overall
flavor
does
not
charge
me
up
as
much
as
others
this
is
a
musttry
for
even
those
not
thrilled
with
this
style
im
hooked
already
tried
this
beer
at
the
allagash
brewery
following
a
tour
really
unique
beer
from
allagash
even
at
11
abv
it
doesnt
come
off
as
too
boozy
like
some
beers
might
great
execution
and
a
beer
worth
trying
again
and
again
hats
off
to
allagash
on
this
one
i
was
expecting
a
much
heavier
and
more
intense
beer
and
was
surprised
by
how
mild
and
bright
this
is
belgian
spices
and
fruity
esters
dance
about
with
a
thin
veil
of
vanilla
oak
and
whiskey
to
keep
it
together
i
love
this
i
have
nothing
else
to
say
take
the
plunge
and
spend
the
1820
worth
pours
brass
with
pure
clarity
and
a
white
froth
pear
slight
smoke
and
ripe
orange
to
the
nose
tastes
of
more
pear
taffy
a
bit
of
grain
apple
burtn
sugar
and
waterlogged
oak
alcohol
is
prominent
body
is
medium
to
heavy
this
is
my
first
and
hopefully
not
my
last
go
at
a
ba
tripel
overall
hard
to
determine
the
true
characteristics
of
this
beer
as
the
flavors
seemed
to
separate
in
the
bottle
heavier
bourbon
taste
at
the
bottom
and
the
fruit
at
the
top
recommend
swirling
your
bottle
before
opening
for
a
better
experience
oso
this
beer
was
worth
the
18
after
all
enjoyed
it
alot
wish
the
price
tag
was
less
so
i
could
drink
this
more
often
i
do
not
know
the
ratio
of
how
much
they
blend
the
fresh
triple
with
the
barrel
aged
tripel
but
being
that
the
bourbonvanillaaged
characteristics
are
so
subtle
i
would
say
a
majority
of
this
beer
is
the
fresh
tripel
not
complaining
at
all
because
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
will
have
to
grab
this
years
and
see
how
it
taste
the
appearance
is
translucent
and
light
copper
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
the
aroma
brings
an
odd
combination
of
belgian
yeast
citric
spice
bourbon
vanilla
oak
not
offputting
just
unusual
certainly
an
interesting
brew
a
lot
going
on
though
i
must
say
i
would
prefer
any
of
the
better
tripel
beers
to
this
while
the
barrelaging
is
well
executed
i
dont
believe
it
adds
to
a
beer
of
this
ilk
there
are
some
flavors
that
just
naturally
clash
and
perhaps
bourbon
and
tripels
were
not
meant
to
be
united
all
that
said
this
was
decent
though
i
wont
buy
it
again
really
gorgeous
beer
golden
straw
color
small
tight
bubbles
wonderful
creamy
pillowy
head
that
staid
around
for
quite
a
while
the
nose
is
sweet
malts
banana
coriander
maybe
some
grapes
and
white
wine
definitely
sweet
sadly
no
discernible
or
strong
barrel
characters
in
the
nose
and
similar
in
the
taste
similar
to
the
nose
with
some
faint
oak
but
definitely
sweet
malts
and
spicy
belgian
yeasts
faint
tart
like
lemon
rind
would
never
have
guessed
it
was
11
very
tight
carbonation
but
moderate
feel
for
such
a
sweet
beer
goes
down
easy
and
dry
all
in
all
this
was
a
fantastic
tripel
but
the
consensus
was
that
as
there
was
little
apparent
barrel
character
it
was
somewhat
disappointing
if
the
price
point
was
lower
i
would
definitely
try
again
d
although
light
on
the
actual
bourbon
spirit
notes
for
me
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
tripels
i
have
had
very
tasty
smooth
and
well
crafted
a
bit
pricey
if
you
ask
me
but
would
definitely
enjoy
this
one
again
overall
a
style
that
ive
not
tried
from
barrels
before
and
while
it
was
interesting
i
must
admit
to
being
a
little
bit
let
down
by
my
high
expectations
not
the
beers
fault
by
any
means
and
in
fairness
my
expectations
didnt
come
from
anywhere
other
than
excitement
at
the
uniqueness
of
this
take
on
the
style
would
be
curious
to
try
it
again
with
less
age
or
another
barrelaged
tripel
just
to
see
how
they
compare
allagash
a
perfector
of
the
belgian
style
came
through
with
a
twist
on
this
beer
barrel
aging
this
company
decided
to
barrel
age
their
already
stellar
triple
now
this
doesnt
come
in
over
the
top
super
potent
heavy
alcohol
barrel
aged
feel
but
more
so
a
slightly
whiskyish
notes
at
the
finish
im
not
one
for
all
the
nuances
that
a
lot
of
reviewers
go
into
i
do
agree
that
the
nose
isnt
as
good
as
the
taste
though
this
is
my
favorite
beer
since
i
cant
get
heady
topper
which
i
have
had
curieux
is
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
with
a
wonderful
taste
o
havent
been
impressed
with
allagash
beers
but
this
one
is
on
another
level
not
only
is
it
delicious
but
it
is
easy
drinking
this
is
i
the
top
10
so
far
o
outstanding
ba
tripel
bottle
from
a
shop
in
cali
but
cant
remember
where
big
cork
and
caged
bomber
dated
bottling
june
27
2013
pours
a
beautiful
clear
golden
color
with
a
tall
fluffy
white
head
not
a
lot
of
aroma
to
speak
of
some
sweet
pears
banana
honey
yeast
and
a
hint
of
bourbon
for
sure
heavy
oak
up
front
flavor
with
some
light
vanilla
and
coconut
this
fades
into
honey
and
light
sweet
fruits
and
banana
midpalate
and
down
the
throat
and
leaves
an
oaky
vanilla
honey
flavor
on
the
palate
for
a
while
slick
palate
with
adequate
carbonation
on
the
heavy
side
for
the
style
as
expected
to
stand
up
to
bourbon
barrels
overall
this
was
an
interesting
treat
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
for
it
again
i
dont
really
get
the
big
love
for
this
one
o
this
isnt
the
first
type
of
beer
id
put
in
a
bourbon
barrel
i
feel
like
scotch
or
rum
might
have
been
more
interesting
but
it
was
a
delicious
beer
nonetheless
a
very
nice
treat
dark
in
appearance
boozy
in
aroma
and
flavor
but
with
a
depth
that
showcases
the
belgian
flavors
mixed
with
the
bourbon
sweet
tasting
and
easy
to
drink
a
real
treat
sweetness
aside
the
phenols
and
spiciness
are
somewhat
subdued
compared
to
the
scent
very
full
mouthfeel
as
one
would
expect
from
the
style
throughout
the
beer
the
barrel
aging
is
very
evident
but
there
isnt
a
hint
of
alcohol
presence
o
it
really
tastes
like
they
mixed
a
tripel
with
a
chardonnay
its
interesting
and
good
enough
to
finish
but
not
good
enough
for
me
to
buy
another
i
know
that
bourbonbarrel
aging
is
all
the
rage
in
craft
brewing
these
days
but
it
seems
to
suit
the
strongerheavier
styles
better
as
the
barrelaging
mellows
their
rough
edges
a
tripels
delicate
flavors
are
just
overwhelmed
by
the
oak
othis
is
great
version
of
a
belguim
triple
o
pretty
yummy
i
think
the
barrel
aging
really
brings
out
some
new
attributes
to
the
traditional
tripel
curieux
was
a
huge
letdown
especially
considering
that
i
paid
nearly
20
for
this
bottle
not
only
was
the
flavor
profile
simplistic
and
quite
harsh
but
the
bourbon
element
was
practically
nonexistant
allagash
makes
some
terrific
beers
but
this
definitely
is
not
one
of
them
o
a
very
unique
and
tasty
treat
albeit
quite
expensive
that
makes
for
a
nice
sipper
the
barrel
character
works
well
with
the
base
beer
and
imparts
a
nice
complexity
definitely
worth
trying
because
there
is
just
nothing
else
like
it
mediumlight
body
with
ample
carbonation
2013
vintage
recommended
if
you
can
share
it
o
they
overdid
with
the
barrel
treatment
i
imagine
this
is
what
adding
oak
cubes
or
spirals
to
the
fermenter
tastes
like
kind
of
a
one
dimensional
beer
othis
is
a
really
classy
beer
the
barrelaging
is
noticeable
but
not
hityouinthe
face
boozy
or
drying
or
funky
you
can
also
tell
that
the
base
beer
is
a
solid
tripel
the
best
trick
this
beer
can
perform
however
is
making
you
think
you
are
drinking
a
normal
beer
not
an
11
monster
all
the
positives
notwithstanding
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
profile
to
nudge
this
beer
from
great
to
worldclass
o
a
flavorful
belgian
tripel
with
a
balanced
oak
character
that
compliments
the
beer
and
adds
to
the
complex
flavors
the
original
and
best
version
of
this
style
and
when
i
revisit
it
i
am
always
reminded
why
its
so
popular
highly
acclaimed
and
darn
tasty
it
pours
a
opaque
bright
golden
color
with
as
much
head
as
you
care
to
stir
up
bone
white
and
permanent
it
smells
really
strongly
of
vanilla
intense
bourbon
whiskey
notes
wheat
malt
belgian
yeast
fresh
oak
and
warming
alcohol
there
are
subtle
floral
notes
from
the
yeast
in
the
taste
elegant
and
lively
while
the
sweetness
of
the
vanilla
brings
out
the
best
of
the
cereal
malts
bourbon
is
obvious
its
familiar
too
and
the
barrel
just
brings
it
all
together
i
dont
taste
booze
at
all
which
shocks
me
at
11
abv
it
drinks
just
way
too
easy
carbonated
very
effervescently
this
beer
simply
dances
on
the
palate
usually
tripels
are
sweeter
than
i
like
but
this
one
comes
out
just
right
on
the
sugar
scale
complex
doesnt
begin
to
describe
curieux
which
has
to
be
up
there
with
allagashs
best
work
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
every
serious
beer
drinker
needs
to
try
in
their
lifetime
found
this
randomly
at
a
local
grocery
store
and
was
beckoned
to
try
it
by
the
gleaming
reviews
it
received
on
here
this
is
also
my
first
brew
from
allagash
first
thing
that
surprised
me
was
how
light
and
transparent
it
is
i
was
expecting
something
heavier
and
darker
but
it
gleams
a
bright
offgolden
with
thin
head
it
is
a
great
looking
beer
and
in
a
wide
mouth
glass
it
seems
to
glow
as
light
refracts
through
the
almost
entirely
translucent
liquid
the
next
thing
that
surprised
me
was
the
smell
it
was
actually
rather
muted
and
not
the
full
force
wave
of
smells
that
accompanies
most
barrel
aged
heavy
duty
brews
this
was
light
mildly
sweet
with
notes
of
wheat
and
mild
citrus
the
taste
is
absolutely
great
and
wonderfully
smooth
it
starts
with
some
fresh
fruits
like
banana
and
orange
and
finishes
with
oats
and
mild
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
and
very
refreshing
no
booze
despite
the
11
but
a
nice
warming
feeling
ensues
wonderful
beer
but
a
tad
pricey
if
honest
captivating
expansive
and
radiant
interesting

o
allagash
tripel
is
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
and
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
tripel
the
bourbon
barrels
add
an
interesting
element
to
the
beer
and
works
very
nicely
with
the
style
overall
this
is
excellent
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
the
subtleties
that
can
come
from
barrel
aging
as
opposed
to
the
bourbon
slams
that
often
result
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
very
well
balanced
between
fruits
and
smoky
spicy
alcohols
and
is
definitely
in
a
class
of
its
own
as
opposed
to
the
dozens
of
tripels
that
seem
like
clones
of
each
other
in
comparison
well
worth
trying
overall
wow
this
is
awesome
i
couldnt
ask
for
a
better
beer
after
a
long
day
refreshing
yet
strong
with
a
lot
of
great
flavor
od
quite
a
nice
tripel
im
finding
it
quite
difficult
to
pick
up
any
real
assertive
bourbon
notes
but
that
might
not
be
a
bad
thing
i
can
see
how
the
barrel
has
imparted
some
subtleties
that
have
complimented
the
base
beer
well
quite
a
nice
and
complex
beer
with
lots
to
keep
you
thinking
about
it
and
an
abv
forcing
you
to
take
your
time
with
it
i
noticed
myself
drinking
this
way
too
quickly
for
its
abv
which
isnt
always
a
bad
thing
well
done
according
to
the
label
they
only
bottled
1400
cases
of
this
beer
its
rare
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
also
as
i
was
tracking
this
beer
on
untappd
i
see
they
have
a
bookers
barrel
and
a
four
roses
barrel
offering
does
anyone
know
if
that
is
more
rate
than
this
i
would
love
to
try
them
all
side
by
side
maybe
i
will
get
a
bottle
oft
heir
tripel
in
my
next
trade
to
compare
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
cheers
and
happy
4th
of
july
everyone
overall
a
superb
triple
allagash
always
impresses
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
had
and
probably
even
better
than
their
standard
tripel
not
easy
to
get
but
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
poured
ontap
at
the
brewery
tasting
room
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
honeygold
coloring
with
a
white
filmy
ring
on
the
surface
nose
of
grain
and
sweetness
with
a
heavy
bourbon
overlay
there
is
spicing
that
helps
to
cut
the
richness
in
the
aromas
flavors
of
bourbon
initially
with
booze
and
warmth
followed
by
a
toasted
grain
backbone
honey
and
vanilla
sweetness
and
subtle
earthiness
smooth
and
surprisingly
light
in
body
there
is
a
boozy
and
rich
aftertaste
with
a
slick
slow
lingering
finish
wow
overall
the
barrel
aging
doesnt
really
do
any
favors
allagash
makes
an
excellent
tripel
that
isnt
improved
upon
here
poured
from
a
bottle
that
came
straight
from
the
allagash
taproom
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
really
nice
white
lingering
lace
very
bourbon
forward
on
the
smell
and
taste
and
left
lingering
vanilla
and
mild
acohol
notes
this
beer
was
awesome
and
i
was
pleasently
surprised
with
how
much
of
the
bourbon
characteristics
came
through
ahhhh
yea
the
rating
speaks
for
itself
went
to
maine
and
visited
allagash
taproom
they
let
us
sample
this
bought
2
bottles
couldnt
find
it
for
45
months
then
i
did
bought
2
more
bottles
bottles
were
1519
for
a
750
well
worth
it
maine
beer
is
impossibly
smooth
so
the
alcohol
taste
barely
stays
im
a
big
fan
of
cask
beers
so
thats
maybe
why
i
liked
it
so
much
theres
a
boozy
finish
as
this
is
at
11
abv
my
favorite
tripel
so
far
its
not
your
standard
fare
but
this
really
is
spectacular
poured
a
golden
body
with
great
carbonation
for
lots
of
head
and
lace
patches
on
top
of
at
first
is
a
lightly
tart
funky
smell
with
some
sour
and
tropical
fruit
notes
and
spice
got
some
sweet
fruit
and
sugariness
out
of
the
aroma
too
but
not
much
woodiness
or
bourbon
taste
is
the
same
as
the
barrel
aging
helps
out
in
the
mouthfeel
with
some
smoothness
and
the
bourbon
notes
are
quiet
but
add
some
heat
on
the
back
but
not
overpowering
more
of
a
traditional
tripel
in
regards
to
taste
with
a
solid
balance
of
some
tropical
fruits
like
orange
peel
and
banana
some
sweetness
from
sugary
malts
and
possibly
tropical
fruit
and
touches
of
spice
thanks
to
some
clove
and
even
a
slight
sourness
i
swear
i
got
a
taste
of
sour
apple
not
a
traditional
tripel
in
the
strictest
sense
but
the
addition
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
is
a
nice
complement
to
the
brew
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
had
on
tap
at
sticks
ans
stones
tonight
poured
into
a
goblit
a
lightly
hazed
lighter
golden
with
a
nicely
formed
white
head
aromas
are
big
in
the
bourbon
barrel
department
with
mild
phenols
and
spiced
pearsa
nice
mix
of
things
going
on
sweet
bourbon
vanilla
flavors
along
with
more
sweet
alcoholspiced
phenols
are
there
but
kept
in
check
pretty
wellsome
boozy
fruit
in
the
finish
a
nice
barrel
aged
tripel
not
over
the
top
bourbon
wise
but
it
packs
a
kick
overall
well
im
officially
an
idiot
for
waiting
so
long
to
try
this
this
is
probably
the
best
tripel
ive
had
i
cant
believe
this
doesnt
fly
off
shelves
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
trippel
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
the
flavors
and
smells
blend
well
together
to
make
a
very
good
beer
im
definitely
going
to
have
to
pick
this
beer
up
again
d
goes
down
too
easy
to
too
easy
my
one
complaint
is
where
is
the
bourbon
seems
like
they
almost
blended
it
out
of
the
equation
otherwise
a
very
drinkable
very
smooth
belgian
blond
ale
overall
an
obvious
quality
brew
from
a
reputable
brewery
that
i
would
be
sure
to
try
again
o
an
obviously
well
made
beer
that
almost
certainly
would
have
been
better
2
years
ago
still
tastes
very
good
but
everything
is
too
muted
to
be
world
class
based
on
this
bottle
and
other
reviews
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
this
is
silky
smooth
with
a
complex
nose
and
medium
bodied
flavor
that
hangs
on
long
after
each
swallow
one
can
definitely
detect
the
bourbon
as
well
as
a
hint
of
honey
by
my
standards
this
was
pricy
but
worth
it
forced
to
write
more
in
order
to
post
so
there
is
also
a
hint
of
an
english
ale
like
old
speckled
hen
but
only
a
hint
thanks
cw577enfield
o
very
drinkable
and
interesting
at
the
same
time
the
oak
and
bourbon
are
strong
enough
to
really
enhance
without
overpowering
or
wearing
on
the
palate
ok
the
counter
says
that
i
must
say
more
ok
got
it
if
you
are
aware
of
being
past
half
way
there
this
beer
might
be
for
you
time
sometimes
and
beer
is
all
we
have
it
is
one
outstanding
beer
that
you
can
be
proud
to
server
your
best
friend
your
best
client
your
boss
or
your
future
father
in
law
it
is
a
pleasant
beer
for
sipping
tasting
drinking
paring
with
any
and
all
healthy
or
unhealthy
foods
it
is
as
i
mentioned
earlier
a
beer
that
will
likely
be
on
my
expected
brews
list
in
heaven
assuming
i
get
there
overall
i
think
it
fits
with
the
style
pretty
well
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
probably
one
of
the
most
pleasant
beers
that
i
have
had
o
wow
delicious
tripel
i
would
have
never
guess
a
tripel
aged
in
oak
bourbon
barrels
would
taste
like
this
o
an
interesting
beer
the
bourbon
flavors
are
really
nice
but
it
doesnt
work
especially
nicely
with
the
tripel
flavors
in
my
opinion
its
worth
giving
a
shot
but
i
probably
wont
need
to
try
this
again
anytime
soon
world
class
no
doubt
o
top
notch
tripel
one
of
the
best
ever
in
my
opinion
not
a
super
strong
overpowering
bourbon
barrel
character
but
it
does
add
some
nice
complexity
i
think
this
makes
sense
because
it
would
probably
overpower
the
crisp
and
yeasty
flavors
of
the
tripel
like
a
jackieos
kentucky
monk
having
said
all
of
that
it
shouldnt
be
surprising
because
the
base
beer
is
my
favorite
tripel
of
all
time
i
gave
it
a
4
45
but
that
was
before
quarterpoint
scores
honestly
im
not
sure
if
this
an
improvement
or
not
its
different
for
sure
but
noticeably
heavier
and
boozier
definitely
more
complex
but
loses
some
of
the
crispness
that
really
makes
the
base
beer
wonderful
close
call
allagash
definitely
has
the
market
on
tripels
locked
down
though
nothing
else
comes
close
in
my
opinion
passionate
as
sin
ended
so
suddenly
age
dampens
the
bourbon
a
good
bit
but
its
still
kicking
a
solid
bass
triple
that
gets
a
bit
more
depth
with
aging
in
barrels
and
a
cellar
im
thinking
2
years
is
prime
pours
a
lovely
translucent
yellow
golden
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
pure
white
head
a
lot
going
on
with
the
bouquet
bubble
gum
vinegar
olive
and
green
grape
mouthfeel
is
nice
mediumbodied
wet
and
with
just
the
slightest
bite
of
carbonation
at
the
finish
i
get
the
bubble
gum
right
away
theres
a
bit
of
tartness
but
it
is
very
mild
everything
about
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
mild
i
know
its
been
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
but
i
get
a
hint
of
chardonnay
it
finishes
with
a
very
pleasant
oaky
vanilla
very
good
trippel
overall
great
example
of
the
style
and
more
flavor
from
the
bourbon
adds
to
it
i
thought
a
lighter
beer
not
a
stout
would
have
a
much
stronger
bourbon
characteristic
but
theyve
melded
the
two
to
compliment
each
other
and
not
overpower
the
base
beer

o
great
beer
excellent
earthy
tripel
bourbon
is
well
integrated
pleasure
to
drink
intent
to
get
another
bottle
to
cellar
o
i
dont
know
if
its
better
than
la
fin
du
monde
but
its
really
damn
good
regardless
the
booze
is
hidden
almost
so
brilliantly
i
cant
help
but
applaud
especially
given
its
ba
roots
is
it
worth
1820
not
really
there
isnt
quite
enough
holy
shit
quotient
in
the
flavors
here
then
again
im
not
a
massive
fan
of
the
style
having
said
that
its
an
excellent
choice
for
those
who
love
tripels
and
bourbon
barrel
aging
o
this
is
a
great
tripel
that
is
given
an
enhanced
and
slightly
different
flavor
profile
thanks
to
the
barrel
aging
the
balanced
mouthfeel
and
taste
is
extraordinary
avoiding
the
extremes
of
being
either
too
heavy
and
boozy
or
too
fizzy
and
dry
it
rests
in
the
middle
with
the
mouthfeel
gravity
and
character
of
a
fat
balloon
and
classic
tripel
taste
with
added
unique
dimensions
among
those
of
the
style
i
have
yet
tried
this
is
second
only
to
chimay
blue
or
maybe
even
better
my
only
consternation
is
the
price
a
craftsman
is
due
his
crafts
market
value
that
i
will
never
deny
him
but
damnit
this
stuff
should
flow
from
fast
food
fountain
drink
dispensers
with
free
refills
in
my
utopia
the
price
of
admission
is
steep
at
15
per
22oz
at
50
per
22oz
it
would
still
be
worthy
o
this
is
a
very
elegant
beer
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
more
than
their
normal
tripel
they
got
the
barrelaging
just
right
present
but
doesnt
dominate
big
thumbs
up
o
overall
i
am
very
impressed
crisp
and
clean
with
oakbourbon
hints
o
i
normally
like
to
see
more
balance
between
the
barrel
and
the
base
beer
the
barrel
dominated
this
one
but
it
was
still
an
amazingly
complex
beer
that
drank
way
too
easily
for
the
abv
overall
bourbon
is
nicely
mellow
and
doesnt
overtake
this
beer
it
was
a
good
idea
for
allagash
to
blend
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
with
some
fresh
triple
the
blend
works
well
the
flavor
is
unique
some
may
not
like
it
but
i
say
its
a
great
success
o
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
truthfully
i
did
not
want
to
crack
it
but
i
noticed
the
level
in
the
bottle
had
dropped
so
i
had
no
choice
a
damn
damn
good
beer
o
just
a
carefree
beer
that
joins
two
things
id
never
think
to
meld
together
its
great
not
overdone
or
boozy
this
brew
is
belgian
greatness
normally
i
hate
heat
burn
but
with
this
brew
its
so
flavorful
and
deep
highly
recommended
and
well
worth
the
16
price
paid
i
cannot
wait
to
trade
for
some
more
of
this
stuff
i
need
a
southern
trading
partner
i
have
read
this
in
reviews
for
this
beer
perhaps
not
for
those
new
to
craft
i
agree
i
would
not
have
liked
this
when
i
was
just
getting
into
craft
also
if
youre
into
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
try
this
but
dont
expect
the
characteristics
of
the
barrel
to
come
forward
the
same
way
they
do
in
a
stout
for
example
overall
impression
is
that
allagash
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
excellent
beer
odi
have
actually
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
quite
a
while
i
am
disappointed
lacks
a
hearty
barrelinfluenced
flavor
i
enjoyed
its
rather
mellow
degree
of
belgian
yeast
but
the
flavor
is
still
a
bit
bland
high
potential
low
yield
o
one
delicious
beer
with
a
sense
of
calculation
what
i
love
about
this
beer
the
most
is
with
each
sip
the
alcohols
presence
becomes
more
bold
thus
also
enhancing
the
other
flavors
i
wouldnt
recommend
to
newcomers
but
this
will
truly
be
something
appreciated
among
the
experienced
palate
beer
lovers
should
at
least
buy
one
bottle
to
storeage
and
others
should
find
it
on
tap
at
20
00
a
bottle
its
something
to
have
on
special
occasions
savor
good
beer
oa
delicious
triple
the
bourbon
barrel
adds
nicely
to
the
overall
taste
and
balance
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
big
2
finger
white
head
that
never
fades
very
nice
brightness
to
the
pour
good
clarity
as
well
smells
of
dough
yeast
bourbon
and
some
funk
a
lot
going
on
with
the
nose
taste
is
surprisingly
smooth
for
the
big
abv
some
fruit
comes
through
with
sweetness
mild
notes
of
bourbon
left
in
the
3
year
old
bottle
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
still
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
complex
and
great
ages
very
nicely
with
the
alcohol
balancing
with
the
sweetness
o
thanks
patrick
this
was
a
huge
win
i
only
wish
i
had
a
few
dozen
more
o
really
really
good
a
delight
to
drink
anytime
but
especially
after
a
long
day
at
work
the
label
on
the
brew
said
that
this
was
from
the
october
2010
batch
and
750
cases
were
bottled
the
brew
poured
with
a
one
finger
white
head
into
my
rogue
chalice
every
time
i
use
these
glasses
i
think
that
are
darn
heavy
anyways
the
head
dissipated
and
didnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
color
is
a
light
yellow
with
a
hint
of
orange
and
presents
with
moderate
carbonation
the
body
is
clear
on
the
nose
i
got
a
lot
of
bready
and
yeasty
notes
then
i
get
some
golden
fruit
and
sugars
i
dont
smell
much
of
the
oak
that
i
thought
i
would
from
being
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
on
the
taste
the
first
thing
i
say
is
damn
this
is
a
good
beer
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
this
there
is
a
definite
woodvanilla
characteristic
then
the
fruit
then
some
breadiness
and
spices
the
alcohol
which
is
hefty
at
11
really
only
makes
itself
known
on
the
finish
when
it
really
warms
the
throat
there
is
light
carbonation
on
this
brew
which
is
perfect
the
brew
itself
is
lighter
than
i
thought
and
not
really
syrupy
i
love
this
brew
o
like
ive
said
this
is
weird
but
it
is
so
drinkable
and
pleasant
that
i
cant
put
it
down
o
best
beer
of
all
time
especially
for
beers
that
arent
seasonal
bottle
or
tap
ive
never
been
disappointed
this
is
a
really
solid
tripel
the
flavor
is
fantastic
there
is
no
mistaking
the
alcohol
content
here
though
you
know
what
youve
gotten
yourself
into
at
some
points
i
thought
the
booze
overcame
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavor
notes
otherwise
this
was
a
really
good
beer
good
for
a
late
evening
beside
the
fireplace
i
dont
know
if
i
just
aged
this
too
long
or
what
but
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
is
so
close
to
nonexistent
its
not
even
funny
i
thought
this
was
heavy
on
the
bourbon
and
oak
so
i
aged
it
a
while
but
what
im
currently
drinking
is
like
a
trippel
that
had
maybe
1020
aged
in
barrels
a
little
disappointing
that
theres
so
little
bourbon
because
i
think
a
strong
showing
of
that
would
work
really
well
but
this
beer
still
is
pretty
good
i
was
just
looking
forward
to
more
bourbon
o
stellar
o
highly
recommendable
fully
enjoyable
without
parings
one
i
will
certainly
seek
out
in
the
future
wow
just
an
awesome
brew
overall
it
was
an
incredibly
enjoyable
beer
will
definitely
have
this
again
and
enjoy
it
thoroughly
this
is
full
bodied
there
is
a
soft
but
effervescent
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
nice
treat
to
have
every
now
and
then
lots
of
complexity
fantastic
brew
maybe
not
for
all
but
definitely
a
favorite
on
my
list
too
bad
they
stopped
exporting
to
texas
they
said
texas
would
be
the
first
state
to
receive
allagash
again
as
soon
as
they
can
meet
demand
bottom
line
worth
the
money
a
well
made
brew
great
beer
cant
wait
to
pick
up
another
bottle
and
age
it
o
i
was
somewhat
hesitant
to
order
this
one
because
of
the
price
9
00
for
an
8oz
pour
but
decided
to
go
for
it
although
this
is
not
a
style
i
have
seen
bourbon
barrel
aged
before
i
was
very
impressed
with
how
well
the
barrel
and
tripel
flavors
melded
i
am
not
one
who
believes
that
anything
you
throw
in
a
bourbon
barrel
will
come
out
better
but
this
one
works
on
every
level
i
will
seek
out
some
bottles
now
that
i
know
it
is
worth
the
price
this
is
probably
the
best
allagash
beer
i
have
tasted
overall
4
5
delicious
and
original
cool
to
get
those
triple
flavors
aromas
along
with
the
wood
and
bourbon
taste
from
the
aging
i
feel
like
theres
not
too
many
companies
aging
belgian
styles
like
this
i
dig
it
20
for
a
750
ml
is
a
little
steep
but
if
youre
not
worried
about
the
price
id
say
give
it
a
try
for
sure
it
grew
on
me
very
complex
and
layered
flavors
make
this
a
joy
to
drink
the
11
also
goes
easily
unnoticed
unless
you
actively
think
about
it
complex
balanced
and
very
satisfying
trippel
overall
i
actually
feel
i
have
had
better
bourbon
barreled
triples
but
this
is
the
best
i
have
had
that
is
widely
distributed
very
drinkable
alcohol
very
very
well
hidden
and
complex
only
knock
is
the
weak
aroma
o
an
excellent
beer
im
sad
it
was
only
brewed
once
highly
recommended
will
have
again
poured
into
a
20
oz
duvel
tulip
bottled
in
september
of
2011
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
orange
with
a
3
inch
white
head
with
lacing
everywhere
smell
is
huge
clove
banana
musk
and
some
fig
the
taste
is
wow
much
more
aggressive
with
clove
and
a
big
tickle
of
bourbon
body
is
medium
enought
carbonation
for
its
large
size
not
overly
dry
for
me
and
drinkable
enough
and
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
at
all
this
is
an
excellent
beer
especially
if
belgians
are
your
thing
i
prefer
hoppy
beers
but
this
is
well
done
even
so
a
beauitful
triple
full
of
flavor
and
packs
a
nice
punch
this
beer
starts
off
with
a
strong
carmel
taste
with
a
hint
of
the
alochol
which
settles
in
as
you
drink
it
has
a
great
yeast
taste
to
finish
off
which
does
not
overpower
the
carmel
taste
but
really
helps
enhance
it
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
for
its
amazing
taste
and
feel
all
whole
hitting
me
with
that
11
abv
also
goes
very
well
with
dessert
or
any
sweet
meal
the
beer
pours
a
darkish
amber
with
an
intensely
fluffy
white
head
there
is
definitely
sediment
but
it
could
be
poured
off
after
a
year
of
agingsettling
the
beer
was
served
relatively
warm
which
produces
a
sweet
yet
tart
bourbon
nose
and
plenty
of
yeastiness
it
drinks
very
easily
and
you
forget
almost
instantly
that
this
bubbly
champagnelike
tripel
is
11abv
the
bourbon
is
well
masked
and
the
beer
is
easily
consumed
very
tasty
beverage
thats
worth
trying
is
you
like
belgian
style
and
wood
aged
beers
ive
got
to
get
more
of
these
nice
bright
color
and
brilliant
aroma
the
bourbon
flavors
really
pop
but
are
not
overwhelming
the
alcohol
note
is
a
bit
strong
but
hey
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
makes
this
beer
what
it
is
wow
pours
gold
with
a
white
head
smell
is
heavily
of
bourbon
taste
is
light
but
with
a
finish
of
burbon
given
the
heavy
abv
its
quite
remarkable
really
as
it
mostly
hides
the
heavy
impact
given
its
a
tripel
its
quite
remarkable
as
most
dont
have
such
a
flavor
pretty
near
perfection
o
good
effort
for
a
style
of
beer
that
isnt
normally
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
would
definitely
try
again
in
the
future
im
impressed
with
this
american
tripel
finally
a
beer
that
is
not
staying
true
to
standard
belgian
brewing
format
and
is
delicious
complex
and
welldone
all
at
the
same
time
allagash
will
always
be
one
of
my
favorite
american
breweries
paying
homage
to
belgium
another
exceptional
brew
from
them
that
ill
be
seeking
out
again
in
the
future

overall
a
great
beer
i
am
a
fan
of
most
things
bourbon
barrel
aged
so
im
sure
i
am
bias
i
think
this
is
my
first
tripel
in
that
field
and
i
hope
more
brewers
follow
suit
o
this
was
a
great
tripel
from
allagash
definitely
recommended
if
you
like
belgian
beers
has
a
nice
complex
unique
sugary
sweet
sour
taste
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
could
have
easily
had
more
then
an
8
5oz
serving
o
this
is
pretty
interesting
and
tasty
but
the
tripel
is
ultimately
drowned
out
by
the
barrel
could
be
a
little
more
balanced
2013
update
curieux
always
reinforces
my
opinion
of
it
this
is
a
must
try
tripel
great
brew
i
would
love
to
have
a
whole
bottle
of
this
to
enjoy
myself
though
the
alcohol
will
probably
destroy
me
i
love
the
way
the
bourbon
added
to
this
brew
though
i
really
did
not
expect
it
would
have
such
an
effect
overall
it
is
a
magnificently
balanced
and
complex
tripel
ok
concept
but
didnt
really
do
much
for
me
the
flavor
profile
was
very
muddy
and
even
though
i
split
it
5
ways
it
still
got
a
bit
cloying
by
the
end
of
the
glass
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
but
incredibly
drinkable
for
being
an
11
sipper
this
beer
is
a
musttry
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
is
powerful
and
has
some
bold
bourbon
flavors
punching
you
in
the
mouth
but
it
works
well
its
something
different
from
a
tripel
something
you
find
more
in
stouts
but
i
like
the
direction
they
went
with
this
one
i
had
it
fresh
and
if
i
recall
i
think
the
bourbon
presence
was
much
stronger
for
those
who
dont
appreciate
that
aspect
let
it
sit
o
a
good
beer
overall
though
the
bourbon
overwhelms
the
tripel
aspects
at
times
i
would
reccomend
this
beer
to
try
at
least
once
but
thats
about
it
overall
its
a
good
beer
with
some
excellent
attributes
but
would
be
better
with
a
little
less
bourbon
or
maybe
a
little
more
age
this
one
was
bottled
72011
so
its
just
six
months
old
o
very
good
deep
complex
lots
of
fruit
and
spice
drinkable
bitter
dry
finish
and
light
oak
dave
o
always
bypassed
this
one
in
years
past
solely
on
the
price
tag
its
a
really
solid
beer
oi
really
enjoy
this
stuff
especially
on
tap
a
real
treat
to
have
every
one
in
awhile
overall
a
decent
beer
the
barrell
and
bourbon
notes
overpower
the
more
subtle
complexities
drinkability
is
pretty
high
o
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
i
just
hate
the
pricetags
on
some
beers
having
had
this
beer
on
draft
a
number
of
times
the
bourbon
always
seems
to
overpower
everything
else
about
the
beer
but
with
a
year
or
two
in
the
bottle
it
really
mellows
into
something
special
this
wasnt
as
whizbang
as
i
had
been
expecting
but
the
flavors
were
really
nice
i
liked
that
the
tripel
base
wasnt
too
sweet
the
more
malty
and
spicy
characteristics
played
well
with
the
bourbon
o
an
interesting
beer
that
was
a
good
triple
but
not
sure
how
the
barrel
aging
really
enhanced
this
beer
only
issue
was
that
it
got
a
big
cloying
at
the
end
notes
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
be
great
to
age
since
its
flavorful
complex
and
pretty
hot
i
threw
two
into
the
cellar
so
i
can
see
how
they
mature
over
the
years
to
be
continued
i
personally
found
it
to
be
a
special
recipe
from
allagash
although
not
really
worth
the
20
price
ive
had
far
better
tripels
and
while
the
barrelaging
does
provide
complexities
of
its
own
it
really
distracts
the
overall
flavor
and
throws
it
off
balance
with
too
much
alcohol
i
realize
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
achieve
and
it
achieves
it
very
well
but
i
personally
cant
bring
myself
to
have
it
again
anytime
soon
due
to
these
traits
o
a
very
good
strong
belgianstyle
ale
i
am
looking
forward
to
aging
the
other
one
i
have
very
good
would
highly
recommend
phenomenal
example
of
a
golden
belgian
triple
the
barrel
aging
takes
the
edge
off
and
gives
a
super
smooth
profile
its
worth
the
overall
i
do
like
this
one
due
to
its
heavy
oaky
nature
that
said
the
tripel
portion
of
the
beer
i
find
is
very
subtlealmost
overwhelmed
by
the
oak
i
am
not
sure
if
that
is
a
bad
thingjust
different
i
may
go
out
and
get
this
again
but
there
are
other
allagash
beers
i
would
get
first
overall
pretty
damn
tasty
but
wanted
more
bourbon
dr
among
the
strangest
beers
ive
tried
everyone
should
try
it
because
its
experimental
its
sort
of
a
novelty
item
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
curious
indeed
o
an
enjoyable
beer
the
oak
aging
adds
complexity
to
the
normal
tripel
characteristics
overall
very
delicious
and
interesting
there
is
again
a
mystery
flavor
that
i
cannot
distinguish
but
this
is
absolutely
a
worthwhile
treat
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
bourbon
barrel
tripel
id
love
to
add
this
to
my
regular
line
up
however
my
one
hang
up
is
the
price
that
being
said
its
still
worth
it
o
definitely
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
the
pineapplecoconut
combo
is
new
and
the
crafting
cant
be
beat
a
great
beer
but
the
price
tag
is
steep
there
are
other
beers
i
enjoy
as
much
or
more
that
are
more
reasonable
i
did
really
like
beer
and
it
is
a
good
occasional
treat
d
a
heavy
tripel
and
a
mighty
tasty
sipper
the
many
layers
of
smell
and
flavor
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
drink
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
allagashs
barrel
series
a
very
enjoyable
beer
really
pretty
hard
to
compare
it
to
standard
tripels
as
the
barrelaging
adds
in
whole
new
features
very
good
o
really
rich
and
delicious
have
to
certainly
be
in
the
right
mood
for
the
vanilla
and
sweetness
but
if
you
are
amazing
one
thing
keeps
this
from
being
a
five
is
the
finish
wish
it
was
a
little
cleaner
i
get
too
much
sweetness
that
lingers
overall
nice
taste
but
really
the
bourbon
is
the
best
part
the
base
tripel
just
isnt
that
impressive
so
interesting
i
dont
know
of
any
other
barrel
aged
triple
bm
me
if
you
do
because
id
like
to
try
another
but
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
that
is
both
approachable
and
complex
would
delight
a
newbie
or
a
seasoned
ba
outstanding
a
brewery
that
has
constantly
impressed
me
having
tried
this
several
times
though
i
think
its
best
after
about
a
year
cheers
the
glass
of
four
year
old
curieux
im
brought
contains
liquid
thats
a
bright
golden
to
lemon
yellow
with
just
a
bit
of
visibility
through
it
theres
just
a
tiny
bit
of
white
foam
due
somewhat
to
the
pour
and
as
a
result
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
or
head
retention
the
nose
is
heavy
on
vanilla
soaked
pale
fruits
with
bourbon
and
oak
playing
supporting
roles
and
the
former
shining
through
more
than
the
latter
im
surprised
not
to
find
any
clove
or
pepper
aromas
anywhere
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
same
sweetened
fruitiness
opens
the
beer
and
a
bourbon
presence
thats
a
bit
more
prominentaggresssive
than
in
the
aroma
cuts
though
mid
palate
before
a
subtle
woodiness
closes
the
beer
out
once
again
im
somewhat
let
down
by
the
lack
of
yeasty
phenols
as
they
are
somewhat
standard
for
the
style
for
a
beer
thats
firmly
in
the
double
digit
abv
territory
its
got
an
impressive
lightness
of
body
the
carbonation
is
just
a
tad
dull
but
its
a
minor
issue
as
a
pure
drinking
experience
i
enjoyed
curieux
a
bit
more
than
the
score
here
would
indicate
but
looking
at
it
as
a
triple
i
cant
grade
it
too
highly
when
its
missing
one
of
the
hallmark
characteristics
of
the
style
i
wonder
if
this
beer
will
age
well
note
bottled
august
2011
golden
yellow
in
color
not
as
dark
as
i
would
have
expected
nice
foam
nose
is
lovely
wood
and
vanilla
doesnt
seem
to
be
over
wooded
on
the
nose
light
fruit
as
well
coconut

banana
lotion
tastes
a
little
too
standard
surprised
and
disappointed
in
the
flavors
still
really
good
above
average
without
a
doubt
o
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
bourbon
flavors
but
still
very
nice
i
bought
this
having
very
high
hopes
i
really
enjoy
bourbon
barrel
aged
brews
so
when
i
saw
this
one
i
was
really
excited
to
try
it
i
opened
the
bottle
and
gave
it
a
pour
it
comes
out
as
a
hazy
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
gave
the
brew
a
good
noseful
and
got
mostly
a
sour
aroma
to
it
perhaps
its
from
the
oak
barrels
thats
fine
i
was
expecting
a
sweet
vanilla
aroma
from
the
bourbon
or
something
but
it
smelled
more
like
a
sour
tripel
than
anything
else
the
taste
was
basically
the
same
way
mostly
had
a
tart
flavor
to
it
and
virtually
no
bourbon
flavors
that
i
could
pick
up
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
it
had
a
good
feel
to
it
and
it
was
still
drinkable
overall
i
was
just
a
little
bummed
about
this
brew
to
say
the
least
i
was
hoping
it
would
have
been
a
bit
different
than
it
was
i
haveanother
bottle
that
im
hanging
on
to
one
day
ill
have
it
again

sweetness
white

surprisingly
no

there

going
on
here

a
decent
slightly

mouthfeel
that
is
still
very
smooth
no

noticed
other
than
a
warming
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barrel
aged
tripel
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
because
i
hear
it
is
even
better
while
it
is
younger

there

warmth
in
the

after

this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
a
medium
bodied
feel
as
well
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
barrelaged
flavor
interesting
to
see
a
tripel
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
another
outstanding
beer
from
allagash
i
think
i
have
enjoyed
everything
i
have
tried
from
them
this
one
pours
very
frothy
nice
pale
orangeyellow
color
great
head
which
dissipates
slowly
wonderful
aroma
vanilla
bourbon
but
not
too
much
the
taste
is
fantastic
some
bourbon
barrel
aged
brews
are
too
heavy
on
the
bourbon
taste
for
me
this
one
gets
it
perfectly
this
may
be
the
first
tripel
style
that
i
have
tasted
that
was
bourbon
aged
wonderful
combination
in
my
opinion
a
fantastic
sipper
a
little
pricey
but
worth
it
im
going
to
have
to
go
back
and
buy
a
few
more
im
guessing
this
will
be
even
better
with
time
this
one
was
bottled
in
may
11
o
a
pretty
tasty
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
the
alcohol
presence
knocks
it
down
a
tad
for
me
but
would
certainly
give
this
one
another
shot
would
like
to
try
it
from
a
bottle
to
see
how
that
changes
it
o
this
one
is
pricey
but
it
is
good
while
wouldnt
have
all
the
time
is
definately
worth
drinking
o
this
is
an
interesting
blend
and
very
good
but
could
be
better
with
more
time
in
the
bottle
or
a
better
bourbon
barrel
knob
creek
would
be
nice
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
tripels
ive
had
not
what
i
expected
at
all
after
this
black
and
a
couple
others
ive
had
ill
be
removing
the
rest
of
the
allagash
beers
from
my
wants
list
now
the
cpj
a
full
mouthful
with
hints
of
vanilla
let
you
know
this
beer
is
definitely
a
little
different
different
sips
sometimes
presented
additional
notes
including
oak
but
overall
a
very
consistent
and
delicious
tasting
beer
a
quality
product
that
is
unique
as
compared
to
many
of
allagashs
other
products
in
taste
though
consistent
in
terms
of
high
quality
golden
color
with
moderatetohigh
carbonation
lemony
and
creamy
with
vanilla
and
some
serious
bourbon
on
the
finish
booouuuurbon
obscure
reference
to
my
new
haircut
senior
citizen
edition
some
pale
malt
and
belgian
yeast
hides
behind
it
some
oak
mediumbodied
and
fairly
boozy
as
a
side
note
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
worth
the
16
it
cost
me
more
like
a
1012
bomber
definitely
a
classic
wish
i
had
let
it
chill
a
little
longer
to
see
a
greater
range
of
flavors
as
it
warmed
but
still
a
nice
experience
ive
been
craving
this
one
all
week
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
tripels
at
all
but
this
one
seemed
worth
the
try
on
tap
during
an
allagash
takeover
of
a
local
restaurant
mekong
in
richmond
va
the
added
flavor
from
the
barrel
process
is
to
me
a
perfect
example
of
how
to
show
case
that
process
on
an
already
strong
beer
this
revived
my
interest
in
tripels
o
an
interesting
triple
that
adds
a
new
page
to
my
previous
triple
experience
i
would
not
pass
this
beer
up
if
i
saw
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
look
for
it
specifically
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
this
is
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
drinking
beer
overall
if
you
like
the
bourbon
aged
beers
this
is
a
good
one
sip
it
and
use
caution
another
of
my
favorite
beers
this
beer
started
me
on
the
quest
for
bourbon
barrelaged
beers
a
light
colored
almost
golden
in
color
beer
cloudy
with
a
thin
ivorycolored
head
a
very
light
nose
of
bourbon
and
clove
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
syrupy
with
slight
effervense
the
bourbon
taste
is
very
pronounced
with
hints
of
clove
and
honey
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
drunk
in
a
while
if
parabola
were
a
tripel
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
di
thought
the
bourbon
barrelaging
might
make
this
tripel
more
up
my
alley
but
this
is
just
really
not
my
thing
there
is
no
body
or
malt
presence
to
compliment
the
bourbon
overall
weird
and
awesome
all
the
opposing
flavors
come
together
to
be
one
of
the
most
interesting
unique
beers
ive
had
my
only
disappointmentthat
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
tumbler
beer
is
thin
and
watery
with
a
strong
dry
finish
lots
of
whiskey
the
whole
thing
is
like
drinking
a
whiskey
with
a
little
bit
of
bitters
in
it
not
very
enjoyable
as
a
beer
as
the
liquor
character
shades
the
entire
beer
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
25
ounce
bottle
o
good
not
overly
impressed
but
its
solid
o
taste
and
mouthfeel
redeemed
the
meh
smell
i
like
it
recommended
overall
this
ones
tasty
but
not
worth
the
price
and
not
exceptional
imo
o
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
would
love
another
this
maybe
my
favorite
beer
i
love
triples
and
i
havent
found
one
that
beats
this
i
understand
that
fin
de
monde
is
good
and
fairly
inexpensive
but
it
does
not
have
the
complexity
of
curieux
nor
the
flavor
each
time
i
try
it
i
find
something
new
bananasnutmeg
spice
certainly
bourbon
booze
and
it
all
blends
perfectly
i
love
val
dieu
and
st
bernardus
even
fin
de
monde
but
curieux
is
the
cats
ass
it
dont
get
no
better
overall
impression
for
being
a
11
beer
you
couldnt
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
or
even
know
it
was
present
it
was
a
very
complexed
beer
with
strong
attributes
i
would
tell
you
to
enjoy
this
anytime
possible
on
tap
but
cant
turn
you
away
from
the
bottle
either
the
bourbon
barrelaged
attribute
was
almost
never
present
but
made
the
tripel
even
better
when
it
came
down
to
it
one
of
the
best
ive
had
this
year
to
nitpick
the
smell
was
really
unassuming
but
i
got
a
pour
with
a
very
thin
head
so
that
may
explain
that
its
easy
to
see
now
why
the
bottles
command
such
a
high
price
but
it
was
quite
reasonable
on
draft
this
is
amazing
bourbon
aged
stouts
soooo
overdone
an
adventurous
take
on
the
style
and
just
when
i
was
getting
bored
with
tripels
this
is
a
beer
you
can
chew
on
its
expensive
so
save
it
for
friends
you
will
not
be
disappointed
they
will
be
deeply
impressed
ive
nearly
passed
this
beer
up
almost
every
time
i
see
it
mainly
because
of
the
higher
price
tag
for
the
bottle
15
around
here
but
it
is
in
fact
worth
every
dollar
its
a
very
unique
and
interesting
spin
on
a
tripel
that
is
executed
extremely
well
overall
a
definite
complex
dessert
like
beer
not
cloying
not
overly
boozy
but
one
to
share
and
savor
ogood
beer
wish
it
was
more
balanced
overall
an
excellent
and
unique
beer
great
combination
of
the
wood
and
sour
ripe
fruit
leads
to
a
very
different
experience
overall
this
is
one
of
very
best
tripels
i
have
ever
had
along
with
la
fin
du
monde
and
tripel
karmeliet
and
has
easily
found
a
place
as
one
of
my
personal
favorite
beers
of
all
time
perfection
in
a
bottle
it
is
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
every
penny
as
an
occasional
treat
o
this
one
is
fairly
boozy
and
a
bit
hot
the
soft
approach
of
the
flavour
profile
makes
the
booze
easier
to
handle
the
bourbon
could
have
been
a
wee
bit
stronger
but
it
was
still
tasty
o
i
liked
this
before
but
dear
lord
this
is
amazing
im
in
love
a
gorgeous
truly
unique
beer
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
tripels
and
barrelaged
tripels
nonetheless
i
find
curieux
to
be
an
enjoyable
sipper
i
could
have
a
million
of
these
man
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
bottle
im
wondering
if
i
might
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
i
heard
binnys
can
produce
a
bad
bottle
or
2
because
if
this
is
how
it
normally
tastes
it
is
wayyy
overpriced
color
was
the
best
part
nice
light
murky
orange
i
smelled
almost
nothing
at
all
on
the
nose
tasted
like
alot
of
bourbon
which
i
do
love
me
some
bourbon
forward
beers
but
thats
all
i
got
nothing
else
not
much
hops
lightly
carbonated
like
i
said
i
think
i
might
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
because
this
was
very
unimpressive
if
this
is
the
norm
pours
a
great
golden
orange
with
a
good
amount
of
head
smells
seductivley
sweet
with
honey
and
yeast
shining
through
the
flavers
are
absolutely
majestic
the
belgium
spices
with
the
honey
and
bourbon
meld
wondrously
the
bourbon
can
be
tasted
with
a
good
swirl
in
the
mouth
goes
down
super
smooth
you
can
just
barely
taste
the
11
alochol
overall
one
of
the
greatest
beers
ive
had
adding
to
my
cellar
this
beer
pours
a
murky
orangeyellow
with
a
nice
twofinger
cream
colored
head
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
continuously
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
from
first
pour
through
last
sip
there
is
not
a
lot
of
aroma
but
what
is
there
is
fruity
maybe
banana
or
pineapple
as
for
taste
it
starts
off
sweet
and
creamy
with
the
carbonation
dancing
on
my
tongue
the
finish
is
more
tart
crisp
and
dry
lots
of
ripe
fruit
flavors
are
detectable
as
is
the
wood
flavor
from
the
aging
process
there
is
a
little
alcohol
burn
with
this
beer
though
not
as
much
as
other
beers
in
the
10
abv
range
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
very
enjoyable
but
also
very
pricey
i
would
definitely
consider
this
again
for
a
special
occasion
fuller
medium
body
lighter
carbonation
sticky
and
chewy
drinks
pretty
nice
plenty
of
bourbon
barrel
flavor
definitely
something
i
want
again
but
hot
up
front
d
a
truly
unique
beer
that
is
undoubtedly
world
class
by
far
my
favorite
allagash
creation
a
sipper
for
sure
a
beer
for
a
special
occasion
sophisticated
and
complex
a
truly
exception
beer
whose
edges
are
just
ever
so
slightly
rough
which
keeps
this
from
being
at
the
pinnacle
of
beerdom
well
worth
the
lofty
price
medium
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
beer
slides
over
the
tongue
easily
the
carbonation
causes
this
beer
to
fizz
on
your
tongue
and
gives
great
drinkability
i
recommend
this
bottle
for
an
enjoyable
pour
it
is
pretty
expensive
but
i
think
it
is
worth
it
for
a
special
occasion
like
wednesday
night
o
i
really
like
bourbon
aged
anything
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
lots
of
different
flavors
going
on
more
so
as
it
warms
up
love
it
so
complex
and
engrossing
truly
an
incredible
example
of
the
craft
at
its
most
alchemical
m
smooth
very
little
carbonation
tastes
like
a
cask
offering
that
has
been
bottled
i
was
concerned
that
i
had
kept
this
in
the
cellar
too
long
but
that
is
not
the
case
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
beer
is
way
too
drinkable
for
being
11
i
feel
the
alcohol
is
masked
and
blended
well
enough
that
it
really
comes
across
as
closer
to
the
78
in
terms
of
the
mouth
and
flavors
good
balance
between
the
tart
green
fruits
and
the
smooth
and
sweet
bourbon
and
vanilla
aspects
and
i
have
to
admit
its
a
little
surprising
as
the
tripel
isnt
necessarily
one
i
would
think
of
immediately
when
it
comes
to
styles
i
would
barrel
age
cheers
to
allagash
for
this
excellent
and
epic
beer
o
easy
to
drink
but
its
very
up
front
about
its
11
abv
if
you
can
get
past
the
alcohol
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
delicious
for
my
taste
if
i
wanted
something
that
tasted
this
much
like
alcohol
i
would
skip
the
beer
and
go
straight
for
the
bourbon
still
very
good
in
its
own
right
went
and
bought
more
bottles
to
age
for
a
while
after
tasting
how
much
better
the
bottled
version
was
over
the
draft
excellent
beer
highly
reccomended
my
favorite
allagash
brew
my
favorite
tripel
and
one
of
my
favorite
barrelaged
beers
they
hit
a
grand
slam
with
this
one
o
a
very
good
beer
interesting
they
nailed
the
bourbon
flavor
without
over
powering
the
rest
will
be
buying
again
really
good
beer
all
around
perfect
for
special
occasions
or
a
tasting
definitely
easy
to
diagnose
the
hell
out
of
the
complexities
in
the
taste
quite
a
winner
i
recommend
having
this
once
drink
i
could
put
back
a
couple
bottles
of
this
pass
out
and
have
some
more
a
good
beer
the
knock
is
the
abv
and
the
big
bottle
status
or
else
5s
all
day
long
d
drinkability
is
moderate
a
beer
i
was
looking
forward
to
just
falls
a
bit
short
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
the
bourbon
barrel
influence
but
it
was
still
interesting
a
fantastic
beer
only
made
better
by
the
aging
process
in
the
bourbon
barrels
balanced
no
hint
of
alcohol
burn
sweet
vanilla
woody
earthy
quite
good
cheers
overall
allagash
has
managed
to
achieve
a
great
balance
of
bourbon
and
tripel
with
this
beer
its
the
best
of
both
worlds
d
slow
sipping
beer
but
gets
better
and
better
with
each
sip
d
solid
definitely
a
sipper
but
it
grows
on
you
allagash
curieux
is
a
real
luxury
beer
for
1520
per
750ml
bottle
i
cant
say
its
the
worlds
greatest
deal
nor
would
i
buy
it
often
but
its
a
great
special
occasion
bottle
for
beer
lovers
who
appreciate
well
done
belgian
styles
and
barrel
aging
for
my
money
its
probably
the
best
of
allagashs
line
up
and
i
like
their
whole
spread
the
wild
ales
the
stouts
the
abbey
styles
etc
overall
an
interesting
style
to
barrel
age
and
honestly
not
my
favorite
i
like
triples
i
am
a
big
fan
of
most
things
thrown
into
a
barrel
but
this
style
sort
of
clashes
for
me
it
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
i
like
trying
allagashs
experiments
an
a

effort

54overall
impression
we
lovez
us
some
bourbon
the
fact
that
allagash
was
able
to
blend
that
flavor
perfectly
with
a
delicate
style
like
a
tripel
is
just
amazing
even
newbeez
might
love
this
beer
beergodzfeb
25
but
i
know
cascades
vlad
had
some
bourbontripel
in
there
and
it
was
worlds
better
than
this
one
wont
even
consider
buying
this
again
at
17
not
as
drinkable
as
i
remember
a
bit
sweet
and
tiresome
i
may
prefer
this
slightly
in
the
bottle
i
would
recommend
this
to
all
beer
lovers
especially
those
who
enjoy
a
complex
tripels
ontap
at
dive
bar
worcester
ma
into
an
allagash
tulip
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
cottony
white
head
leaves
great
lacing
smell
is
kind
of
citruscherry
definitely
getting
the
bourbon
as
well
taste
is
strange
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
at
first
but
found
myself
very
intrigued
and
liking
it
more
and
more
with
every
sip
huge
on
syrupy
bourbon
fruit
peppery
yeast
medicinal
notes
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
creamy
like
i
said
before
syrupy
obviously
with
a
11
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
its
alcohol
city
but
that
being
said
its
definitely
not
as
hard
to
drink
as
it
could
be
a
whole
different
beast
from
allagashs
regular
tripel
but
im
not
sure
which
i
prefer
id
like
to
try
it
again
allagash
at
their
best
one
of
the
best
american
brewed
belgian
style
ales
out
there
wicked
smooth
and
tasty
and
a
very
easy
drinking
special
treat
maybe
too
sweet
for
some
such
as
the
beer
geeks
near
me
at
the
bar
who
had
it
in
their
sampler
flight
and
didnt
like
it
but
not
unexpected
for
the
style
been
a
while
since
id
had
this
and
it
was
good
to
become
reacquainted
at
11
it
is
one
powerful
beer
definitly
recomend
comments
this
interpretation
of
a
tripel
may
be
unconventional
but
it
is
wonderfully
complex
and
seductive
to
enjoy
1203
drinkability
not
sure
if
ive
reached
the
end
of
this
beer
or
not
as
far
as
age
im
sure
it
could
still
hold
up
but
what
seems
to
be
the
case
or
what
i
can
gather
from
at
least
imagining
a
fresh
bottle
is
that
the
bourbon
obviously
has
held
up
the
most
while
the
more
fruit
ester
flavors
of
the
tripel
style
havent
dissipated
as
much
as
theyve
integrated
themselves
into
the
wood
and
barrel
and
bourbon
flavors
so
this
is
what
it
comes
down
to
if
youre
a
fan
of
bourbon
after
five
years
youre
going
to
love
this
if
youre
not
well
im
not
sure
how
much
of
a
fan
youre
going
to
be
i
do
have
to
say
though
that
after
this
long
this
has
held
up
very
well
and
i
feel
like
things
have
gone
the
way
they
were
supposed
to
d
an
easily
drinkable
barrel
aged
offering
from
allagash
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
and
the
carbonation
is
perfect
for
this
style
when
it
comes
down
to
it
it
is
not
hard
to
drink
the
750ml
yourself
d
great
barrel
aged
beer
which
really
picks
up
the
characteristics
of
the
barrel
it
was
aged
in
a
very
good
tripel
which
stands
up
to
many
of
the
greats
in
the
world
d
such
a
good
beer
and
so
mellow
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
good
complex
flavors
disappointed
because
i
love
allagash
a
tasty
big
brew
nice
use
of
barrel
aging
with
a
nice
and
subtle
kiss
of
bourbon
that
never
gets
in
your
face
recommended
and
something
i
would
love
to
drink
again
someday
d
another
allagash
creation
impresses
the
hell
out
of
me
and
with
out
a
doubt
this
is
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
i
have
ever
had
mad
respect
should
go
to
the
folks
at
allagash
d
any
bas
that
enjoy
barrel
aged
heavy
beers
like
me
would
really
enjoy
this
beer
drank
the
750ml
bottle
and
looking
for
another
very
easy
to
drink
what
a
cool
idea
barrel
aging
a
tripel
does
this
beer
make
a
successful
argument
for
more
tripels
undergoing
barrel
aging
nah
i
dont
think
so
this
beer
is
very
good
but
ultimately
not
going
to
revolutionize
the
style
a
valiant
experiment
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
however
i
really
like
the
bourbon
bal
aging
that
was
done
to
the
triple
you
get
a
nice
touch
of
warmth
from
this
one
but
thats
about
the
only
hint
that
you
get
about
its
11
0abv
it
is
very
smooth
and
light
which
helps
make
it
an
easy
one
to
drink
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
leans
towards
the
sweet
side
but
i
think
it
is
restrained
enough
to
be
enjoyable
it
has
a
slight
hint
of
dryness
that
keeps
it
from
becoming
cloying
drinkability
excellent
this
is
a
superb
beer
allagash
has
done
a
wonderful
job
i
wouldnt
say
its
an
amazing
brew
but
its
still
pretty
good
very
good
flavor
of
ripe
fruits
sweet
malts
and
solid
booze
great
flavor
and
addictive
this
beer
is
awesome
not
a
huge
triple
fan
but
the
oak
aging
gives
it
some
great
adden
ummphff
d
pretty
darn
good
for
the
style
very
easy
drinking
well
done
glad
i
have
1
left
notes
simply
a
great
beer
from
allagash
that
everyone
reading
this
should
try
i
can
easily
see
buying
one
of
the
650
cases
that
were
produced
in
february
2008
tripel
is
my
favorite
style
and
this
and
weyerbacher
merry
monks
are
probably
my
favorite
examples
d
surprisingly
very
good
drinkability
even
though
it
is
high
in
abv
very
tasty
and
smooth
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
i
will
be
buying
more
what
a
strange
and
wonderful
beer
beautiful
amber
copper
color
with
slight
foamy
head
the
taste
is
unusual
sweet
but
not
cloying
spicy
but
not
overpowering
and
strong
but
not
too
strong
i
love
this
beer
and
will
enjoy
it
for
many
special
occasions
to
come
d
very
unique
first
sip
blew
my
mind
away
if
youre
looking
for
a
taste
adventure
please
check
this
out
i
could
only
have
one
but
the
taste
is
certainly
desirable
for
the
hard
liquor
crowd
perhaps
but
for
me
there
was
no
balance
everyones
strange
brain
needs
their
own
taste
trial

tried
from
the
bottle
and
thought
it
was
superior
to
the
draft
it
picks
up
a
more
traditionally
belgian
crisp
mouthfeel
from
the
bottle
carbonation
poured
a
hazy
orange
copper
color
slight
lacing
retention
smelled
of
bread
spice
clove
and
bourbon
tasting
this
i
experienced
all
of
the
aforementioned
flavors
with
the
addition
of
a
warm
boozy
finish
the
abv
is
hidden
quite
well
until
the
very
end
and
then
slams
your
palate
reminding
you
this
is
a
beer
that
has
to
be
reckoned
with
its
very
smooth
needs
to
be
poured
in
a
tulip
or
snifter
sipped
and
will
kick
your
butt
if
not
paying
attention
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
and
one
i
can
become
addicted
to
the
taste
considering
im
a
hop
head
and
love
the
bitter
stuff
this
is
a
huge
compliment
very
well
done
this
has
to
be
enjoyed
by
itself
not
with
food
i
really
like
this
brew
this
is
a
fascinating
beer
i
love
all
the
bodys
complexities
and
the
unique
texture
they
combine
for
the
aroma
sis
unique
doesnt
quite
do
justice
to
what
you
are
about
to
experience
easily
drinkable
although
it
is
more
to
be
sipped
than
to
be
gulped
as
i
have
watched
some
do
it
pours
with
a
rich
creamy
head
that
reminded
me
a
bit
of
guinesses
the
erathy
taste
is
easily
balnaced
by
the
subtle
flavor
of
citrus
sour
earthy
oak
wood
flavor
with
some
sweet
crisp
light
estery
fruit
notes
mostly
apple
and
pear
slight
citrus
peel
notes
and
again
a
nice
bourbon
presence
the
bourbon
flavor
is
well
integrated
and
doesnt
overpower
the
other
flavors
very
well
balanced
with
some
more
bourbon
flavor
coming
through
in
the
oaky
dry
finish
d
wow
this
is
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
a
perfect
nightcap
but
the
alcohol
is
very
prominent
which
limits
me
to
just
one
11
oz
serving
this
bottle
must
be
shared
to
make
sure
none
is
wasted
pouring
this
beer
into
two
tulip
glasses
revealed
a
richly
colored
golden
ale
with
a
thick
lovely
white
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
a
lovely
blend
of
spicy
yeast
warming
alcohol
light
fruit
with
subtle
bourbon
and
vanilla
from
the
barrel
flavors
are
bold
without
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
luscious
giving
way
to
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
remarkably
wellmade
beer
a
very
high
quality
tripel
aged
in
oak
bourbon
barrels
every
tripel
flavor
in
the
books
like
bright
green
and
red
apple
lemon
orange
liqueur
and
white
wine
bourbon
and
oak
are
pleasantly
prominent
appearance
lacing
nose
and
taste
were
world
class
a
great
beer
experience
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
great
beer
that
has
probably
benefited
from
1
years
in
the
cellar
d
so
excellent
of
kimballs
to
share
this
a
really
beauty
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
ale
very
few
come
close
to
the
drinkability
especially
at
11
the
taste
was
awesome
making
only
wish
i
had
more
the
smoothest
tripel
aged
in
oak
i
may
ever
have
picked
this
up
at
the
union
square
whole
foods
in
nyc
this
is
my
first
offering
from
allagash
and
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
one
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
smells
of
bourbon
vanilla
alcohol
and
tropical
fruit
tastes
of
bourbon
and
orange
fruity
flavors
and
finishes
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
drinkability
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
an
11
beer
overall
an
amazing
offering
from
allagash
makes
me
want
to
try
more
from
them
overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
though
it
has
a
sort
of
grassy
character
throughout
the
beer
which
takes
away
from
the
delicious
bourbon
and
buttery
caramel
d
this
is
an
awesome
beer
to
sip
over
a
long
period
of
time
the
high
alcohol
content
keeps
it
from
being
chugged
definitely
to
be
savoured
with
someone
else
who
is
likely
to
appreciate
it
ive
had
curieux
on
several
occasions
but
only
in
two
oz
pours
so
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
for
some
time

with
quite
a

going
on

coats

and
some
alcohol

culminating
at
the
back
with
a
consistent
background
carbonation
from
start
to

i
either
love
or
hate
this
style
and
the
verdict
here
is
definitely
a
thumbs
up
great
complexity
without
being
overly
sweet
or
cloying
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
well
worth
your
time
tried
this
allagash
after
returning
from
maine
and
looking
for
a
good
trippel
aged
in
oak
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
poured
into
2
wine
glass
the
white
head
was
full
and
stuck
around
for
a
bit
while
still
leaving
decent
lacing
the
color
was
a
hazy
ambergoldenorange
the
smell
was
good
but
not
over
powering
with
some
citrus
honey
or
molasses
and
hints
of
the
wood
coming
through
the
first
sip
pf
this
was
immediately
good
great
balance
of
flavors
carbonation
aromatics
full
bodied
wheaty
which
all
mask
the
fact
that
the
beer
has
a
high
alcohol
content
for
a
trippel
this
beer
is
mellow
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
of
but
full
enough
to
know
you
getting
into
a
good
quality
brew
my
hat
is
off
to
the
folks
at
allagash
for
this
lovely
beer
overall
my
favorite
of
the
allagash
offerings
that
i
can
get
on
a
regular
basis
excellent
and
if
you
can
get
it
for
a
reasonable
price
12
dollars
is
the
best
ive
found
it
dont
pass
it
up
d
excellent
drinkability
this
is
the
first
allagash
beer
i
have
tried
they
seem
to
have
set
a
high
bar
this
beer
is
clearly
wellcrafted
i
would
be
interested
in
how
it
might
react
to
cellaring
highly
recommended
dangerously
drinkable
man
could
a
few
small
glasses
of
this
really
put
you
on
your
ass
d
for
as
big
as
this
beer
is
its
very
drinkable
with
its
good
taste
that
hides
the
abv
well
worth
trying
sometime
d
worth
trying
but
not
something
id
rush
into
again
o
whiskey
overwhelms
the
other
flavors
but
admittedly
i
am
not
a
big
whiskey
fan
intriguing
and
unique
i
like
the
bourbon
barrel
character
better
in
more
aggressive
beers
like
iipas
and
imperial
stouts
anyways
it
was
golden
and
hazy
at
the
start
and
cleared
up
more
towards
the
end
the
aroma
was
delicate
and
reminiscent
of
candied
nuts
the
first
thing
to
hit
from
the
taste
was
belgian
yeast
followed
by
candi
sugar
no
harsh
coriander
notes
in
this
tripel
the
finish
was
of
sugared
fruit
but
not
obnoxiously
cloying
as
some
overly
candisugared
tripels
end
up
anyways
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
no
heat
to
speak
of
from
the
11
abv
this
was
a
rather
good
triple
and
the
barrel
aging
was
a
nice
touch
recommended
i
love
allagash
so
ill
see
if
i
need
to
reevaluate
this
review
after
a
pour
from
another
batch
on
tap
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
smells
strongly
sweet
and
fruity
but
with
plenty
of
oak
and
whiskey
as
well
banana
and
citrus
expected
spiciness
from
the
typical
tripel
yeast
tastes
of
sweet
grainy
malt
yeasty
light
fruit
and
strong
bourbon
its
surprising
how
much
the
whiskey
comes
through
some
oakiness
and
spice
there
as
well
for
me
the
bourbon
character
doesnt
work
well
at
all
with
the
flavor
of
a
tripel
between
the
dijointed
flavors
and
the
high
abv
this
one
doesnt
drink
very
easily
definitly
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
had
it
is
so
smooth
and
flavorful
i
love
the
sweet
floral
scent
that
you
get
drinking
this
from
a
snifter
the
appearance
betrays
its
power
it
is
a
very
light
and
hazy
straw
colored
beer
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
and
malty
taste
with
a
hint
of
hops
it
has
a
really
rich
malt
flavor
the
barrel
aging
has
really
mellowed
this
beer
no
bitterness
and
no
bite
at
the
end
just
smooth
and
rich
flavor
cheers
d
a
good
sipper
that
does
a
decent
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
well
crafted
and
worth
keeping
around
d
at
17
bucks
a
bomb
not
really
but
if
i
were
rich
this
would
be
a
sessions
beer
for
me
i
love
it
high
on
the
alcohol
though
d
if
you
are
a
gulper
then
do
not
waste
your
money
of
allagashs
time
this
beer
is
meant
for
sipping
in
a
relaxed
setting
beers
like
this
are
to
be
appreciated
d
a
sipper
for
sure
but
a
very
fine
showing
from
allagash
verdict
curieux
is
quite
a
special
beer
its
essentially
a
damn
good
tripel
accompanied
not
dominated
by
complex
barrel
and
alcohol
character
if
i
had
the
funds
id
secure
some
bottles
for
cellaring
as
im
sure
this
just
gets
better
with
age
im
picking
up
more
passion
fruit
on
this
brew
it
was
an
interesting
smokey
quality
i
assume
from
the
barrels
bourbon
barrels
are
charred
for
both
smokey
and
sweet
qualities
i
will
either
love
this
beer
or
be
overwhelmed
by
it
as
it
sits
the
beer
develops
a
white
pepper
characteristic
which
is
a
nice
foil
to
the
passion
fruit
the
palate
is
very
alcohol
driven
i
would
age
this
beer
a
little
longer
d
very
good
to
have
another
barrel
aged
beer
without
the
overly
aggressive
booze
flavor
although
the
tastes
are
delicate
they
are
not
overly
complex
great
beer
so
much
flavour
but
thats
what
hurts
the
drinkability
shared
the
bottle
with
a
friend
and
that
was
plenty
hv
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
an
interesting
beer
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
body
very
pale
yellow
fluffy
white
head
creamy
and
lasting
sweet
sour
aroma
light
sour
taste
pretty
sweet
not
rotten
or
acidicly
sour
relatively
smooth
refreshing
fruity
tasting
a
little
dry
on
the
aftertaste
tasty
another
good
beer
from
allagash
this
is
very
unique
something
i
would
recommend
d
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
abv
and
bourbon
flavor
but
definitely
not
a
beer
youll
find
yourself
drinking
quickly
d
a
surprisingly
drinkable
ale
given
the
high
abv
i
especially
like
the
fact
that
the
bourbon
flavor
is
not
overpowering
as
it
can
be
with
other
barrelaged
ales
nicely
done
overall
its
a
little
bitter
but
not
by
much
as
its
a
very
balanced
beer
looking
at
it
you
see
a
very
cloudy
dark
yellow
color
with
a
paper
thin
head
not
many
markings
on
the
glass
and
its
aroma
comes
at
you
like
a
tidal
wave
of
apples
and
bourbon
anyone
say
christmas
cider
tasting
it
is
not
as
good
as
smelling
it
as
a
bitterness
to
the
beer
seeps
in
there
is
an
apple
cider
taste
to
it
up
front
with
a
sharp
alcohol
taste
going
down
not
a
bad
taste
but
still
there
as
it
finishes
though
in
your
mouth
you
detect
why
its
bitter
and
the
oak
and
bourbon
really
come
through
leaving
nothing
but
good
feelings
on
your
taste
buds
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
it
is
a
medium
bodied
even
keel
beer
all
around
cant
wait
to
taste
the
second
in
the
series
i
dont
care
if
this
beer
is
16
bones
a
pop
i
will
buy
several
bottles
every
time
i
see
it
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
from
the
750
ml
corked
bottle
marked
march
2009
sampled
on
june
20
2009
it
pours
a
cloudy
yellowgold
with
a
bubbly
head
that
builds
up
quickly
and
then
diminishes
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
and
sour
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
while
the
taste
is
a
mixture
of
yeast
alcohol
and
grass
it
is
much
like
a
belgian
style
tripel
is
supposed
taste
and
it
is
brewed
in
maine
tastes
like
belgium
drinkability
despite
the
high
alcohol
this
baby
was
extremely
easy
drinking
a
little
high
in
the
alcohol
to
become
a
daily
brew
but
would
make
an
awesome
stand
in
for
white
wine
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
big
bubbly
white
head
that
sticks
around

not
something

great
to
try
but
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
nonetheless
not
something
for
every
day
but
something
worth
savouring
on
a
rare
occasion
try
it
once
now
and
then
maybe
again
in
a
year
or
so
d
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
i
enjoy
cask
beer
and
this
one
was
a
real
treat
i
will
be
buying
some
bottles
of
this
one
d
delicious
and
overall
quite
pleasant
notes
while
this
bourbon
barrelaged
tripel
tastes
pretty
good
its
just
too
damn
fresh
as
of
right
now
the
flavors
just
dont
meld
together
quite
right
the
bourbon
is
a
bit
too
pronounced
which
kind
of
disjoints
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
so
obviously
the
potential
of
this
one
is
through
the
roof
glad
i
got
one
in
the
cellar
because
it
should
be
a
fuckin
rock
star
in
2
to
3
years
a
wonderfully
well
balanced
and
obviously
well
made
quality
ale
pleasant
full
fruit
nose
with
hints
of
whiskey
big
integrated
fruithop
flavors
with
refined
carbonation
and
some
fresh
sweet
characteristics
very
pleasant
bouron
finish
this
appears
to
be
a
drink
that
would
impress
and
please
most
creamy
i
wouldnt
necessarily
say
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
it
is
integrated
well
into
the
structure
of
the
beer
crisp
carbonation
becomes
very
creamy
medium
bodied
despite
the
highly
noticeable
abv
this
beer
ranks
as
above
average
drinkability
wise
this
is
a
good
barrelaged
beer
considering
how
tame
it
is
its
a
bit
pricey
in
terms
of
flavorprice
ratio
14
per
750
ml
but
there
arent
that
many
11
abv
barrelaged
beers
out
there
with
this
kind
of
drinkability
drinkability
vg
but
share
the
bottle
otherwise
you
may
see
ok
just
drink
the
bottle
d
awesome
sipper
and
a
unique
brew
the
appearance
is
dull
the
smell
is
weak
and
the
dryness
leaves
a
bad
mouthfeel
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
very
creamy
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
finish
lingers
for
a
while
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
one
that
i
have
been
wanting
to
get
a
hold
of
thinking
about
a
triple
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
got
my
taste
buds
watering
this
beer
is
a
solid
triple
well
made
and
the
aged
on
it
just
makes
it
shoot
through
the
roof
i
am
so
surprised
on
how
incredibly
creamy
rich
and
peppery
the
beer
is
i
never
was
much
a
fan
of
the
triple
style
but
when
i
tried
the
some
of
the
better
ones
i
became
a
fan
this
is
no
exception
a
very
very
good
beer
the
flavors
come
together
well
very
balance
and
super
easy
to
drink
two
thumbs
up
way
to
go
allagash
and
thank
you
so
very
much
mike
i
am
glad
that
i
got
to
celebrate
my
400th
review
with
this
beer
drinkability
i
thought
that
curieux
was
going
to
let
the
oak
run
wild
and
free
but
it
did
a
nice
job
containing
it
i
guess
my
only
problems
with
this
beer
is
the
lack
of
citrus
flavor
and
the
price
since
its
a
barrel
aged
beer
i
can
give
allagash
some
leverage
on
the
high
price
but
not
so
much
on
the
lack
of
citrus
fruits
would
i
ever
buy
this
beer
again
thats
a
difficult
question
to
answer
right
now
i
might
and
i
may
not
is
it
worth
a
shot
it
can
be
if
you
got
the
money
february

bottling
pours
golden
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
lace
aroma
is
yeast
oaky
almost
saison
like
with
spice
palate
is
medium
higher
than
average
carbonation
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
oak
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
alcoholbourbon
in
the
finish
has
the
bread
triple
flavor
but
bam
in
your
face
with
oak
and
alcohol
i
can
tell
its
a
triple
but
i
thing
the
bourbon
is
a
bit
much
drinkability
its
like
that
curtain
of
glaze
at
krispy
kreme
that
everyones
fantasized
about
putting
their
mouth
under
i
could
put
my
mouth
under
a
waterfall
of
this
beer
and
be
in
heaven
its
what
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
cask
version
i
thought
it
would
give
the
bourbon
more
of
a
chance
to
shine
but
i
think
it
was
weaker
than
the
normal
tap
version
overall
very
drinkable
for
11
abv
i
had
this
about
10
months
after
bottling
it
really
needs
to
age
longer
very
raw
flavors
at
this
point
this
would
be
delicious
with
at
least
2
years
on
it
probably
more
though
good
flavors
and
aromas
but
i
think
more
subtle
flavors
will
arise
when
aged
for
longer
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
one
so
if
youre
looking
to
impress
a
bourbon
drinker
or
going
to
an
upscale
dinner
party
this
beer
is
the
way
to
go
d
at
11
abv
i
can
see
how
this
can
be
consumed
easily
over
and
over
again
try
it
drinkability
is
good
too
bad
this
one
is
so
expensive
but
its
evident
a
lot
of
work
care
and
craftsmanship
went
into
this
one
this
is
one
helluva
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
orange
tones
and
thin
head
for
smell
first
noticed
a
slight
funkiness
to
it
with
a
second
layer
of
bourbon
and
oak
and
finally
some
orange
notes
and
faint
alcohol
the
bourbon
oak
barrel
aroma
was
very
mild
and
not
overpowering
on
first
taste
noticed
the
oak
and
bourbon
but
the
orange
flavors
start
to
come
through
some
warming
alcohol
as
you
work
through
it
would
categorize
as
mediumbodied
but
had
a
smooth
creaminess
to
it
easier
to
drink
then
i
thought
it
would
be
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
deserves
tastings
at
various
stages
and
demands
cellaring
d
a
great
sipper
this
is
the
way
bourbon
barrelaged
beers
are
supposed
to
be
done
my
applauds
recommended
drinkability
this
beer
drinks
easy
but
is
definitely
a
warm
one
i
couldnt
say
that
it
is
anywhere
near
sessionable
but
it
is
one
to
enjoy
on
a
nice
winter
night
a
real
bourbon
beer
the
mouth
is
rather
thick
and
somewhat
creamy
full
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
an
11
abv
quite
a
nice
treat
somewhat
expensive
but
worth
it
this
is
among
my
favorite
tripels
and
it
is
made
in
the
us
i
like
its
untraditional
style
as
the
standard
tripel
is
not
my
favorite
style
recommended
m
d
what
the
cask
conditioning
does
is
make
this
much
more
and
dangerously
drinkable
toning
down
the
booze
bite
it
drinks
less
like
a
complex
aged
triple
and
more
like
a
session
belgian
white
or
double
if
this
11
offering
is
wrong
i
dont
want
to
be
right

even
nicer

oh
my
maybe
with
aging
the
oakiness
will
diminish
but
not
impressed
enough
to
buy
one
to
age
at
this
price
first
impression
what
a

on
this
one
thick
white
head
with
heavy
lacing
on
my
oversizedwine
glass
analyzing
the
aroma
took
me
a
minute
but
it
really
is
brandy
oak
vanilla
and
fresh
malts
just
as
advertised
you
do
taste
the
alcohol
but
it
is
worked
in
pretty
well
considering
its
11
abv
sweet
dry
finish
with
oily
texture
very
nice
an
amazingly
complex
and
tasty
brew
ok
drinkability
good
considering
the
abv
i
like
this
beer
but
i
have
to
say
that
im
not
on
board
with
all
of
the
really
high
ratings
on
here
im
not
convinced
the
tripel
and
the
bourbon
work
here
and
i
do
like
bourbon
i
found
myself
thinking
that
i
would
prefer
the
tripel
reserve
to
this
interesting
beer
though
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
fluffy
carbonation
d
allagash
curieux
is
a
sipper
for
sure
but
it
is
definitely
interesting
and
unique
enough
to
justify
the
high
price
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
the
bottle
was
very
easy
to
finish
the
high
level
of
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
making
more
than
one
of
these
a
very
bad
idea
the
flavor
is
right
for
it
though
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
drink
this
one
without
coughing
up
the
16
for
it
hot
and
hoppy
but
also
with
mellow
and
sweet
vanilla
notes
the
bourbon
flavor
profile
is
hinted
at
but
the
bountiful
hops
never
let
you
forget
this
is
a
tripel
not
jim
beam
great
lively
mouthfeel
exceptionally
clean
and
cohesive
finish
for
such
layered
flavors
really
just
an
outstanding
beer
drinkability
great
beer
to
enjoy
with
some
great
friends
more
expensive
than
the
other
750ml
i
would
definatly
buy
again
and
would
have
a
refriderator
full
for
cellaring
if
my
wife
would
let
me
sigh
man
this
is
one
smooth
beer
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
for
over
a
year
so
i
dont
know
if
it
really
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
built
up
for
it
regardless
it
is
a
seriously
drinkable
and
complex
beer
and
dare
i
say
it
worth
the
money
i
paid
for
a
bottle
this
one
btw
was
only
bottled
in
nov
08
so
i
dont
know
where
it
could
go
with
some
aging
would
love
to
find
out
though
drinkability
a
huge
improvement
over
their
regular
tripel
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable

aftertaste
taste
and

remind
me
of
drinking
a
really
good
port
would
go
fantastic
with
bleu
cheese
and
walnuts
drinkability
is
down
slightly
only
because
of
the
high
abv
which
should
by
no
means
deter
you
from
taking
this
one
on
this
is
definitely
a
celebrationneed
to
warm
upwarming
up
with
your
ladyits
snowing
outside
beer
it
is
a
bit
pricy
but
completely
worth
it
since
all
things
considered
youd
spend
this
much
on
3
crap
beers
in
a
bar
simply
lovely
curieux
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
even
at
11
even
at
the
young
age
of
34
months
the
11
abv
just
doesnt
seem
to
assert
itself
much
in
the
taste
and
oddly
enough
im
not
even
feeling
it
drinks
light
and
lovely
expensive
but
worth
it
overall
this
brew
is
absolutely
amazing
two
things
knock
down
the
drinkability
first
is
obviously
the
alcohol
content
secondly
and
probably
more
important
is
the
price
the
store
i
work
at
charges
15
a
bottle
for
this
beauty
luckily
for
me
a
former
coworker
decided
to
buy
it
for
me
thanks
shane
this
beer
is
fanfuckingtastic
on
tap
at
three
floyds
and
served
in
a
snifter
this
beer
poured
a
lightly
hazed
golden
orange
with
a
thin
head
of
slowly
fading
offwhite
foam
that
left
some
even
lines
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
was
made
up
of
candied
oranges
and
pears
light
clove
and
coriander
and
also
just
a
hint
of
bourbon
the
flavor
was
bright
and
full
of
sugarcoated
oranges
pears
honeycrisp
apples
all
tinged
with
a
mellow
bourbon
note
quite
delicious
the
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
and
lush
moderately
carbonated
i
love
allagashs
tripel
but
the
bourbon
barrels
add
another
layer
of
flavor
to
a
great
beer

wow
the
character
of
this
beer
is
bold
and
beautiful
deceivingly
strong
the

never
gets
in
the
way
of
the
warm
rich
woody

smooth
from
the
top
to

this
is
a
worldclass
brew
now
if
we
could
just
get
a
beer
aged
in
jack
barrels
id
be
totally
satisfied
good
sipping
beer
but
i
cant
handle
too
much
of
this
its
like
sniffing
a
good
air
freshener
how
long
would
you
really
want
to
sniff
it
no
matter
how
good
it
smells

might
be
my
new
favorite
as
i
continue
to
explore
all
available
options
overall
an
interesting
and
pretty
good
tripel
d
usually
i
downgrade
when
the
alcohol
is
so
high
in
this
case
a
gigantic
11
abv
this
stuff
is
the
exception
the
alcohol
is
so
pleasantly
masked
i
could
end
up
in
real

candied

and
booze
in
the
nose
rather
subdued
but
it
might
just
be
too
cold
still
to
really
release
all
the
complexity
this
beer
is
delightfully
complex
sweet
fruits
up

citrus
and
peach
the
alcohol
makes
it
sweet
but
it
is
all
toned
down
by
the
bourbon
barrels
the
aging
really
becomes
apparent
in
the
middle
and
end
flavor
profile
when
the
beer
is
well
rounded
big
bodied
and
smooth
the
11
abv
is
really
well
hidden
and
the
sweetness
is
nicely
muted
by
the
barrels
warms
the
throat
a
little
fiesty
as
it
goes
down
overall
a
great
beer
definitely
worth
the
10
bucks
the
barrel
aging
gave
the
tripel
a
little
bit
more
of
a
kick
than
i
thought
it
would
it
also
tasted
more
spiced
than
i
expected
it
almost
tasted
like
this
years
fluxus
with
a
bit
of
a
bourbon
alcoholic
bite
to
it
overall
a
far
more
complex
profile
than
the
standard
tripel
as
the
beer
got
warmer
it
definitely
opened
up
the
spice
became
a
little
less
overbearing
and
complemented
the
sweet
tripel
on
the
other
hand
fluxus
at
this
temperature
was
undrinkable
for
me
the
bourbon
taste
was
all
up
front
on
my
palate
but
mellowed
as
the
beer
warmed
i
was
enjoying
this
more
a
half
hour
after
opening
rather
than
10
minutes
out
of
the
fridge
at
opening
average
carbonation
which
fits
the
character
of
the
beer
perfectly
as
a
slow
sipper
drinkability
improved
as
it
warmed
and
while
the
alcohol
taste
is
pretty
mellow
as
the
bourbon
aging
helps
smooth
over
the
sweetness
of
the
belgian
style
its
most
definitely
a
sipper
not
sure
about
the
color
and
nature
of
the
pour
from
the
nice
corked
1
pint
bottle
because
the
great
smell
overwhelmed
my
scenes
the
scent
turned
out
to
be
a
great
indication
of
the
taste
and
overall
mouth
feel
it
has
a
sweet
mild
smell
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
just
so
gentle
a
nice
medium
body
with
some
sweetness
you
can
sort
of
tell
the
alcohol
is
present
but
it
really
does
not
hit
until
the
end
of
the
sip
when
a
slight
woody
bourbon
flavor
kicks
in
just
a
terrific
smooth
warmer
im
glad
i
bought
this
bottle
and
held
off
on
opening
it
for
a
while
i
wonder
what
it
would
taste
like
if
alagash
intentionally
infected
a
barrel
or
two
md
everything
about
this
beer
is
perfect
it
has
low
to
medium
carbonation
and
while
there
is
a
ton
of
gravity
to
this
brew
the
only
thing
that
takes
away
from
its
drinkability
rating
is
the
fact
that
i
was
already
feeling
this
one
after
12
of
a
bottle
on
an
empty
stomach
even
so
though
i
would
love
to
drink
5
of
these
750
ml
bottles
i
cant
see
it
happening
purely
because
of
the
abv
complex
drinkable
beer
d
i
have
to
give
it
lower
marks
on
drinkability
it
is
a
hell
of
a
sipper
especially
for
this
style
i
love
it
but
there
is
no
way
i
could
knock
a
few
of
these
back
notes
from
61907
d
this
is
a
wonderful
dry
classy
beer
i
am
impressed
that
the
oak
and
bourbon
are
such
notable
characteristics
of
this
brew
it
was
a
great
opportunity
to
try
this
and
the
11
seems
more
like
8
which
gets
to
be
a
little
much
for
one
person
great
brew
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
overall
other
than
this
minor
imperfection
a
superb
sipping
brew
the
aroma
is
tremendous
with
a
whole
lot
of
bourbon
and
a
decent
amount
of
malt
wood
and
yeast
the
appearance
is
deep
gold
and
cloudy
with
an
orange
hue
to
it
the
flavor
is
strong
and
sweet
and
very
much
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
with
an
alcohol
finish
overall
its
well
made
but
strong
and
not
a
session
beer
is
more
like
liquor
pours
a
glorious
rich
golden
color
with
one
of
the
most
impressive
heads
that
i
have
ever
seen
on
an
american
tripel
i
say
american
because
it
does
not
have
that
traditional
rocky
head
that
belgains
do
but
because
it
is
allagash
im
certain
they
want
this
head
the
way
it
is
the
smell
is
heavily
of
sugar
oak
and
bourbon
the
taste
is
the
same
the
bourbon
is
very
noticeable
and
very
warming
im
not
a
big
fan
of
bourbon
so
i
usually
dont
enjoy
the
bourbonaged
beers
as
much
as
others
do
but
the
curieux
delivers
the
flavors
in
such
a
balanced
way
that
i
am
enjoying
this
bourbonaged
beer
very
much
pretty
damn
good
shit
alas
this
is
the
only
section
where
i
must
punish
this
brew
while
it
is
certainly
drinkable
as
far
as
being
a
great
beer
with
a
very
nice
taste
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
is
very
much
there
no
surprise
given
the
abv
still
not
terrible
just
not
a
session
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
instead
this
is
one
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
yet
another
fantastic
brew
from
the
allagash
specialty
series
well
done
enjoyed
a
couple
of
these
on
tap
with
abfraser
last
night
at
city
beer
store
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
all
around
beers
theres
a
lot
going
on
with
the
flavor
of
this
one
sweet
vanilla
oak
lots
of
alcohol
but
at
the
same
time
not
so
overwhelming
that
you
cant
gulp
it
down
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
creamy
something
i
wasnt
expecting
from
a
lighter
looking
beer
if
this
were
cheaper
id
be
drinking
it
quite
often
another
allagash
gem
i
think
they
consistently
make
some
of
the
best
beers
out
there
bottle
at
brewer
bourbon
aroma
white
wine
champagne
and
funky
farmhouse
taste
drinks
damn
easy
for
the
style
abv
the
warming
sensation
hints
not
to
stay
on
this
too
long
not
a
true
tripel
per
se
but
more
enjoyable
imo
time
for
a
party
a
fresh
bottle
of
barrel
aged
trippel
bought
at
the
downtown
specs
bottled
on
june
8th
2008
pours
a
gold
colour
has
a
ring
of
small
bubbles
average
lacing
is
somewhat
mead
like
i
tell
ya
what
is
a
tasty
beverage
thank
you
drinkability
im
going
to
echo
a
lot
of
other
reviewers
here
and
say
that
im
really
impressed
that
the
bourbon
notes
here
worked
so
well
with
a
delicate
belgian
style
there
was
a
lot
that
could
have
gone
wrong
here
but
everything
seems
to
meld
well
smell
good
and
taste
better
without
anything
overpowering
anything
else
granted
11
abv
is
sorta
crazy
high
for
a
tripel
but
who
cares
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
kudos
to
allagash
for
a
brew
well
done
recommended
smmoth
as
anything
very
drinkable
for
a
wellhidden
in
sharpness
11er
if
you
like
bourbonbarrel
aged
beers
this
one
should
certainly
be
on
your
list
of
beers
to
try
wiseman
jorge
a
4
3
d
this
beer
had
a
pretty
light
malt
flavor
and
a
light
barrel
flavor
with
not
much
depth
but
a
hint
of
complexity
it
was
just
too
subtle
to
be
interesting
drinkability
yeah
not
bad
once
i
got
over
myself
and
stopped
saying
it
tasted
too
much
like
bourbon
d
glad
i
got
to
try
this
wasnt
in
a
hurry
to
drop
12
for
this
one
and
glad
i
didnt
d
quite
a
nicely
done
tripel
hats
off
to
allagash
on
this
offering
theyve
maintained
the
gentle
complexities
of
the
tripel
style
and
turned
it
up
a
notch
without
going
overboard
a
big
one
to
sip
at
for
some
time
very
nice
the
more
i
drank
this
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
luckily
a
good
amount
of
the
tripel
comes
out
to
keep
this
from
being
too
onedimensional
from
the
bourbon
aging
and
i
cant
believe
how
smooth
this
drank
for
a
11
beer
good
work
here
form
allagash
d
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
just
about
the
most
unique
tripel
ive
ever
come
across
and
the
bourbon
and
oak
barrels
work
in
perfect
haromony
but
sometimes
i
felt
as
though
i
was
drinking
a
rather
one
dimensional

it

up
and
became
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
im
glad
considering
the

but
seriously
it
is
very
good
and
if
anything
i
wish
it
came
in
a
bigger
bottle
d
this
beer
is
bad
ass
and
im
going
to
drink
some
more
now
drinkability
this
was
a
great
beer
i
enjoyed
the
barrel
aging
and
definately
would
pick
up
again
this
isnt
hard
to
drink
but
the
flavor
profile
is
a
little
too
mild
for
me
and
heartily
obscured
by
the
oakbourbon
this
probably
needs
some
time
good
but
i
expected
more
from
this
just
finished
my
final
sip
just
wanted
to
say
that
overall
this
beeer
is
just
phenomenal
this
is
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
tripel
big
big
beer
sampled
on

two
years
old
at
the
fabulous

in

nice

white

with
a
yellowing

at

nice

banded
throughout
the

overall
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
that
being
said
this
is
truly
the
best
beer
that
allagash
makes
overall
a
little
ligher
than
expected
but
otherwise
very
tasty
and
drinkable
a
good
sipping
beer
despite
its
alc
this
is
good
this
aged
tripel
is
pretty
much
right
on
this
was
a
brand
new
bottle
just
a
little
over
a
month
old
iam
glad
i
popped
this
now
it
was
perfect
young
the
11abv
was
very
much
hidden
this
was
a
pricey
beer
but
well
worth
it
nice
after
having
a
5
year
old
dulle
teve
last
weekend
i
can
honestly
say
this
domestic
tripel
is
the
best
ive
ever
tasted
bottled
in
june
of
08
and
sampled
in
july
a
fresh
sample
that
i
just
cant
bring
myself
to
age
before
trying
the
pour
shows
a
cloudy
pale
orange
with
a
wonderful
naturally
carbonated
head
that
is
foamy
and
clingy
aromas
hit
me
as
soon
as
the
bottle
was
uncorked
tropical
fruit
and
alcohol
with
a
mild
yet
appealing
bourbon
character
of
whiskey
and
vanilla
belgian
yeast
mustiness
is
also
appealing
and
rather
subdued
taste
when
colder
is
of
refreshing
tropical
fruit
and
vanilla
taste
as
it
warms
is
more
musty
yeast
bourbon
whiskey
and
warming
almost
hot
alcohol
i
would
suggest
serving
curieux
cold
when
paired
with
food
and
warmer
for
an
after
meal
sipper
a
very
complex
and
masterful
brew
t
surprisingly
mild
and
smooth
the
bourbon
isnt
nearly
as
stiff
as
expected
ripe
fruit
slight
hop
bitterness
and
strong
oaky
vanilla
flavor
alcoholbourbon
is
present
in
the
finish
but
not
unpleasant
very
smooth
full
body
finish
is
very
dry
and
clean
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
almost
to
easy
to
drink
for
this
style
its
very
drinkable
but
a
little
too
mellow
and
im
left
wanting
a
little
more
complexity
drinkability
quite
drinkable
but
i
would
probably
buy
another
bottle
to
lay
down
for
aging
over
time
the
alcohol
heat
should
disappear
and
the
true
flavors
should
shine
through
im
not
a
fan
of
bourbon
either
but
this
is
a
beer
that
is
tailormade
for
aging
pick
up
a
bottle
and
put
it
away
for
a
while
d
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
the
casking
seems
to
add
the
creaminess
to
it
whether
or
not
that
helps
this
particular
beer
is
a
matter
of
personal
preference
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
bottle
from
sept

tasted
june
2008
this
one
opened
with
a
fairly
loud
pop
it
pours
a
hazy
almost
amber
tinged
golden
color
there
was
a
large
offwhite
head
on
it
that
settled
quickly
into
a
thin
one
the
nose
is
nice
with
many
notes
i
get
hints
of
the
bourbon
yeast
vanilla
and
citrus
they
dont
overpower
one
another
wow
what
a
taste
this
is
incredibly
smooth
silky
with
a
lot
subtly
going
on
subtle
hints
of
the
bourbon
as
well
as
spices
clove
banana
yeast
what
a
fine
treatment
of
their
already
great
tripel
you
can
really
tell
this
beer
was
aged
in
jim
bean
bourbon
whiskey
barrels
it
gives
it
a
nice
whiskey
flavor
but
not
too
over
powering
the
oak
barrels
almost
give
it
a
slight
chardonney
flavor
as
well
md
smooth
creamy
body
medium
bodied
excellent
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
taste
lost
me
a
little
but
everything
else
is
solid
d
this
was
a
great
tripel
it
was
the
first
that
i
have
had
that
was
bourbon
barrel
aged
and
i
liked
the
kick
drinkability
is
high
and
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
shared
a
750
ml
bottle
with
a
coworker
while
having
dinner
at
the
publick
house
in
the
boston
area
brookline
poured
golden
with
a
temporary
head
well
carbonated
the
smell
was
intriguing
vanillawood
and
bourbon
mixed
with
the
traditional
spicy
sweet
aromas
of
a
belgian
trippel
the
taste
delivered
all
of
what
was
promised
in
the
nose
but
in
a
layered
complex
way
first
the
sweet
malty
taste
then
a
strong
bourbon
wave
that
faded
to
vanilla
and
wood
finally
finished
with
the
clove
banana
and
yeast
flavors
i
would
expect
from
a
belgianstyle
trippel
really
an
exciting
experience
my
co
worker
doesnt
stray
from
the
macros
much
but
he
really
enjoyed
it
as
well
i
am
currently
trying
to
hunt
it
down
in
my
area
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
the
style
may
be
belgian
but
its
soul
is
somewhere
in
appalachia
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
id
love
to
just
sip
it
after
a
light
dinner
with
some
friends
on
the
porch
d
this
is
a
great
beer
it
would
be
a
great
drink
as
an
aperitif
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
fish
or
possibly
chicken
d
such
a
great
beer
but
11
is
a
little
too
much
plus
as
much
as
i
like
tripels
and
oak
aging
i
dont
like
them
together
as
much
as
i
like
tripels
on
their
own
plus
i
like
oak
aging
stouts
and
ipas
solid
brew
but
i
think
that
it
is
a
bottle
to
be
shared
not
worth
the
high
price
for
me
personally
for
15
i
was
expecting
to
be
blown
away
i
believe
you
can
cellar
this
particular
tripel
as
well
and
age
it
even
more
as
an
added
bonus
drinkability
is
good
just
be
sure
not
to
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
had
this
brew
on
cask
at
the
ginger
man
this
past
winter
the
aroma
and
taste
was
very
strong
on
the
oak
and
bourbon
flavors
it
was
quite
the
experience
if
you
enjoy
barrelaged
brews
try
to
find
this
one
on
cask
drinkability
very
easy
to
consume
when
you
consider
its
abv
and
most
definitely
an
evening
sipper
well
worth
the
for
a
single
bottle
of
this
stuff
my
only
dissension
would
be
that
i
probably
would
not
want
this
brew
as
my
everyday
imbibe
simply
because
it
is
such
a
curious
flavor
one
of
my
favs
im
not
sharing
this
bottle
with
anyone
but
will
rush
out
and
get
another
for
friends
if
only
i
were
younger
id
spend
the
entire
day
sipping
away
oh
what
the
hell
bring
it
on
baby
soft
lightlytoasted
wheat
malt
and
mild
astringency
up
front
pear
cider
tangyness
and
tropical
fruit
sweetness
fill
out
the
palate
light
alcohol
and
definite
bourbon
notes
around
the
edges
some
honey
sweetness
mixes
with
peppery
notes
hints
of
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
warming
finish
mild
peppery
herbal
hop
bitterness
is
there
as
well
lingering
tropical
fruit
and
oaky
bourbon
excellent
fullbodied
with
a
very
nice
creamy
mouthcoating
feel
a
very
well
conceived
and
executed
beer
i
love
the
way
the
light
bourbon
and
oak
mix
with
the
sweet
peppery
base
delicious
it
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
i
got
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
because
i
like
the
yeast
so
that
was
the
cause
of
the
cloudiness
the
first
beers
poured
were
much
clearer
the
aroma
is
filled
with
bourbon
and
citrus
and
is
very
pleasant
the
flavor
is
nice
light
and
very
balanced
with
just
a
hint
of
bourbon
and
a
good
sweetness
this
was
a
perfect
mix
of
bourbon
aging
and
tripel
light
to
medium
bodied
and
there
is
no
way
to
detect
any
of
the
11
abv
incredibly
drinkable
pours
a
pale
yellowish
orange
color
cloudy
with
a
very
small
quickly
fading
head
smell
is
lemony
bright
and
cedary
pretty
fresh
aroma
and
taste
is
much
the
same
with
bright
lemony
notes
and
definite
strong
woody
flavors
from
the
barrell
more
so
than
the
actual
bourbon
slightly
creamy
a
very
unique
beer
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
d
yes
as
a
tripel
should
be
drinks
very
smooth
for
11
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
enough
carbonation
on
the
tongue
to
keep
this
one
lively
and
effervescent
im
going
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
bottles
of
this
one
d
youd
almost
think
this
was
a
session
beer
its
so
dangerously
drinkable
but
that
11
would
kick
you
in
the
teeth
if
you
tried
it
d
i
would
give
this
beer
a
17
on
drinkability
if
i
could
if
you
handed
me
a
glass
of
this
and
then
told
me
to
guess
the
abv
i
would
tell
you
around
5
simply
put
amazing
very
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
cloudy
medium
amber
to
bright
orange
color
just
a
shimmer
or
bright
white
head
is
formed
that
quickly
is
reduced
to
a
covering
and
soon
nothing
the
aroma
is
difficult
to
grasp
with
the
cask
pouring
minimal
carbonation
hurts
but
soon
notes
of
sour
cherries
citrus
moderate
clove
and
vanilla
come
through
on
the
palate
however
things
develop
flavors
of
strong
oak
hit
you
hard
first
followed
by
vanilla
spicy
phenolics
and
a
little
citrus
the
cask
conditioning
makes
things
a
bit
muddy
with
a
bright
citrus
tripel
clashing
with
the
strong
oaky
and
bourbon
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
low
to
minimal
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
and
extreme
beer
the
oak
was
a
bit
overpowering
though
hindering
the
drinkability
exceptionally
smooth
and
balanced
belgian
triple
slightly
tart
and
spicy
from
the
wood
but
not
overpowering
like
other
barrel
aged
beers
personally
i
like
the
interlude
better
but
as
always
allagash
comes
through
in
making
another
kick
ass
beer
drinkability
its
pretty
good
go
on
give
it
a
try
what
harm
could
it
do
it
may
have
been
this
pour
but
the
mouthfeel
was
surprising
i
wonder
if
this
would
have
been
better
bottled
or
maybe
it
was
the
surprise
of
low
carbonation
from
the
cask
with
a
distinct
alcohol
flavor
that
i
more
regularly
associate
with
the
powerful
viscous
mouthfeel
of
belgian
tripels
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
richness
here
the
taste
itself
is
rich
and
complex
not
overpoweringand
actually
is
probably
more
drinkable
than
many
other
of
its
style
however
after
being
so
excited
about
the
smell
and
it
being
on
cask
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
definitely
worth
trying
and
an
ambitious
project
from
allagash
d
i
wasnt
sure
if
bourbon
barrel
aging
a
tripel
would
work
but
allagash
has
done
fantastic
job
with
this
one
sweetness
and
bitterness
kick
in
about
mid
glass
this
is
well
made
stuff
allagash
does
well
with
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
smooth
creamy
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
really
good
despite
a
noticeable
alcohol
presence
d
definitely
drinkable
but
only
in
small
quantities
incredibly
delicious
and
complex
really
liked
it
but
obviously
couldnt
do
these
all
night
would
totally
order
again
though
check
it
out
if
you
can
glad
i
got
it
on
tap
as
1
glass
was
about
a
third
of
the
price
of
750
ml
at
the
store
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
complete
frothy
head
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
quite
nice
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
is
very
good
just
the
subtlest
of
hints
of
oak
and
bourbon
it
really
compliments
the
beer
instead
of
taking
over
this
is
a
real
treat
something
i
could
drink
all
day
long
a
very
nice
well
rounded
well
put
together
beer
ive
got
absolutely
no
complaints
pours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
thick
white
head

solid
lots
of

great
retention
smell
is
soft
butter
oranges
bread
wheat
spices
vanilla

bourbon
lemons
oak
some
alcohol
pretty
complex

peach

apricot

oak
caramel
bourbon
pretty
big
flavour
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
damn
solid
and
the
bourbon
works
well
with
this
one
thanks
russ
d
very
drinkable
but
quite
strong
i
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
d
interesting
and
an
allaround
decent
beer
but
the
intensity
of
the
barrel
flavors
makes
this
one
a
bit
dificult
to
drink
right
now
share
it
with
a
friend
or
better
yet
lay
it
down
for
a
while
overall
for
what
it
is
it
is
amazing
the
complex
tastes
are
nice
and
the
fact
that
this
beer
tastes
so
much
like
a
nice
drink
of
bourbon
whiskey
is
astounding
i
enjoyed
it
alot
i
could
not
drink
it
everyday
but
it
sure
was
a
tasty
treat
very
good
stuff
great
use
of
the
bourbon
barrels
light
amber
color
with
hints
of
honey
the
bourbon
added
some
nice
hints
of
vanilla
putting
it
out
front
of
many
of
the
other
tripels
on
the
menu
we
had
this
at
the
end
of
the
night
four
strong
beers
into
a
tasting
so
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
im
confident
that
if
i
ordered
this
again
id
feel
the
same
on
most
accounts
d
a
great
beer
it
seems
to
have
lost
some
of
its
bourbon
character
from
the
2006
edition
which
i
last
had
on
halloween
night
2006
but
still
is
an
excellent
beer
expensive
but
well
worth
it
very
satisfying
d
interesting
blend
of
flavors
with
a
strong
wood
presence
however
most
of
the
tastes
dissipate
quickly
leaving
not
much
in
its
wake
underimpressed
with
this
trippel
d
somebody
build
a
cigar
tent

excellent
way
to
finish

750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
bottled
november
2007
bought
at
lous
in
augusta
pours
a
hazy
golden
amberred
body
with
a
quarter
inch
if
that
of
offwhite
head
smells
fruitycitrusy
and
woody
tastes
citrusy
pithy
malty
with
a
fair
bit
of
wood
and
hints
of
vanilla
toward
the
finish
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
warming
is
evident
on
the
finish
but
buy
no
means
overwhelming
or
solventlike
on
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
bordering
on
sticky
mouthfeel
but
the
carbonation
helps
make
this
one
more
drinkable
than
it
might
otherwise
be
tasty
and
complex
i
think
ill
stick
to
drinking
allagash
tripel
on
a
more
regular
basis
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
definitely
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
go
one
of
the
best
barrelaged
beers
ive
had
so
far
pours
a
luminescent
and
slightly
hazed
gold
a
modest
halfinch
of
head
receedes
quickly
leaving
persistent
lace
tendrils
the
beer
smells
strongly
of
sour
oak
pepper
and
rounded
fruity
vinegar
must
and
earth
linger
at
the
edges
very
nice
initial
presentation
the
flavor
is
peppery
and
fruity
at
first
becomes
velvety
smooth
dry
and
woody
with
a
huge
rounded
alcohol
presence
in
the
finish
strong
enough
to
numb
the
throat
and
warm
the
stomach
the
beer
feels
light
and
a
slightly
fizzy
at
first
but
this
changes
to
a
warm
and
creamy
smoothness
as
the
alcohol
takes
hold
a
very
good
sipping
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
would
be
even
better
if
the
alcohol
didnt
so
overpower
the
other
flavors
could
perhaps
be
mellowed
with
aging
fairly
new
to
allagash
brews
and
this
one
was
the
best
of
their
beers
i
have
tasted
i
need
to
try
interlude
next
very
calm
for
a
strong
beer
and
quite
unqiue
despite
the
very
expensive
price
tag
around
sixteen
dollars
for
a
750
ml
bottle
i
recommend
this
bourbon
barrel
tripel
to
those
who
have
not
tasted
it
yet
i
am
initially
inclined
to
think
that
this
would
be
a
great
beer
with
a
cigar
but
i
wonder
if
it
might
be
too
sweet
to
make
a
good
match
perhaps
it
would
go
well
with
something
light
and
spicy
but
there
is
only
one
way
to
find
out
tasted
about
a
year
ago
and
have
wanted
to
find
it
since
found
a
bottle
recently
certainly
has
aromas
of
sweetened
vanilla
and
oak
very
nice
this
has
a
nice
big
complex
flavor
slightly
sweet
and
not
over
the
top
this
might
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
people
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
i
am
very
surprised
that
its
at
11
its
very
smooth
im
still
on
my
first
pour
so
maybe
some
other
qualities
open
up
when
it
comes
to
room
temp
d
this
could
be
deadly
im
glad
i
had
a
driver
this
beer
is
amazing
i
really
couldnt
drink
more
than
1
or
2
without
getting
hurt
but
i
might
be
willing
to
try
overall
this
beer
is
interesting
unique
and
delicious

allagashs

looking
i
thick
it
could
support
a
kiwi

leaves
behind
lots
of
delicate

smells
of
vanilla
oak
and
alcohol
didnt
pick
up
any
whiskeybourbon
notes
in
the
aroma
but
it
comes
though
very
clearly
in
the
taste
along
with
associated
flavors
such
as
vanilla
and
oak
bit
of
honey
sweetness
and
spicey
yeast
as
well
produces
a
nice
warming
effect
in
the
aftertaste
velvety
smooth
texture
with
just
enough
carbonation
not
as
complex
as
i
hoped
or
the
easiest
thing
to
drink
but
still
highly
enjoyable
better
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
a
golden
blondish
appearance
very
thick
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
aromas
of

candied
sugar
oak
and
soft
bourbon
complex
in
flavor
tastes
of

lemon
green
apple
spicy

definitely
had
that
boozy

effect
after
each
sip
the
oak
seemed
to
come
out
more
in
the
finish
mouth
feel
smooth
and
soft
moderate
carbonation
overall
drinkability
was
interesting
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
didnt
do
it
for
me
but
never
the
less
it
was
fun
to
try
cheers
this
is
an
awesome
brew
dangerously
delicious
and
drinkable
at
11
i
found
myself
taking
very
frequent
sips
to
explore
the
complexities
of
flavor
and
even
spending
far
more
time
with
the
glass
to
my
nose
than
i
do
with
a
typical
brew
id
love
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
and
leave
it
in
the
cellar
for
awhile
great
stuff
drinkability
is
great
i
really
like
the
mix
of
bourbon
and
tripel
both
stand
tall
and
compliment
each
other
well
nice
balance
too
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
even
more
than
the
plain
tripel
pours
a
gold
orange
that
is
a
bit
darker
and
clouded
of
course
the
flavor
is
presented
with
an
almost
milky
mouthfeel
that
is
thick
and
wooded
smooth
and
almost
a
bit
spicy
but
subdued
in
nature
supremely
crafted
and
masterfully
aged
this
is
a
definite
pleasure
to
drink
pours
slightly
darker
than
golden
with
great
lacing
aromas
of
bourbon
sweet
malt
underneath
that
and
stored
apples
and
pears
with
a
touch
of
cream
similar
flavor
profile
heavy
but
clean
and
pure
bourbon
typical
tripel
tastes
and
some
pear
brandy
on
the
finish
quite
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
delight
to
drink
it
works
and
the
bourbon
is
so
well
integrated
that
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
tripel
flavors
it
enhances
them
ive
had
this
with
beer
lovers
who
dont
like
bourbob
and
they
still
really
like
this
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
from
a
great
brewery
most
of
allagashs
barrel
series
beers
are
pretty
outstanding
and
this
is
no
exception
well
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
assuming
that
you
enjoy
bourbon
from
time
to
time
the
duvel
tulip
i
picked
out
for
this
sampling
seemed
very
appropriate
as
allagash
curieux
came
out
foamy
pale
and
slightly
cloudy
the
smell
was
clean
and
elegant
i
could
detect
a
faint
hint
of
vanilla
in
the
nose
but
not
much
bourbon
the
taste
was
sweet
and
soothing
but
a
little
too
simple
considering
the
barrel
aging
process
not
much
in
the
way
of
oak
flavors
here
but
based
on
my
recollection
this
came
across
a
lot
smoother
than
the
tripel
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
except
for
the
warmth
a
little
flourish
of
hops
was
all
that
i
could
detect
soft
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
aftertaste
lingered
on
sampled
from
the
cask
at
the
publick
house
in
brookline
ma
a
golden
honey
orange
very
thick
legs
all
over
the
glass
s
very
sweet
the
oak
is
definitely
present
toasted
malts
breads
some
fruits
in
there
as
well
t
a
wonderful
honeyfruit
sweetness
up
front
with
a
nice
dry
bitter
finish
really
fantastic
m
thick
smooth
d
when
i
walked
into
the
publick
house
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ordered
and
i
was
not
disappointed
its
a
really
beautiful
extremely
well
balanced
welltempered
tripel
im
going
to
try
to
make
it
back
to
the
publick
house
in
the
next
few
days
to
try
it
again
d
strong
but
i
want
more
so
nice
only
got
this
beer
because
i
had
a
gift
certificate
and
would
not
normally
spend
the
money
poured
a
straw
gold
color
with
about
a
finger
of
quick
dissipating
head
smells
like
bourbon
with
a
touch
of
caramel
light
on
the
mouth
with
lots
of
carbonation
i
want
to
say
the
same
as
most
belgian
style
beers
alcohol
is
hidden
well
with
oak
malt
and
yeast
some
fruit
ester
from
the
yeast
would
suggest
this
beer
maybe
ill
stop
being
such
a
tight
ass
and
start
splurging
on
beers
like
this
more
often
on
tap
at
beachwood
bbq
pours
a
hazy
orange
almost
ipa
color
aroma
of
bourbon
and
belgian
yeast
lighter
carbonation
than
expected
from
a
belgian
but
thats
welcome
in
this
beer
finishes
with
citrius
and
bourbon
all
in
all
a
delicious
beer
highly
recomended
completly
different
than
in
bottles
in
a
good
way
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
this
is
a
truly
unique
tripel
it
seems
like
enough
has
been
said
about
this
beer
but
i
didnt
see
much
mention
of
the
nice
coconutty
scent
and
flavor
i
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
most
dominant
especially
on
tap
taste
of
bourbon
is
there
too
without
being
overly
boozy
my
favorite
of
allagashs
high
end
offerings
lately
keep
em
coming
rob
a
cloudy
honeyamber
golden
with
a
nice
thick

aroma

fruity
and
malty
with
strong
banana
and
lemon
tones
the
rich
wheaty
flavor
fairly
fills
the
mouth
and
the
strong
hoppy
bitter
undertone
gives
it
a
nice
kick
it
goes
down
smoothly
with
a
strong
alcohol
bite
that
is
more
like
hard
liquor
than
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
a
murky
lightmedium
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice

and
sticky

on

side
a
nice
touch
of

the

very
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
take
on
a
tripel
another
awesome
brew
from
allagash
highly
recommended
dark
amber
but
translucent
with
a
one
finger
head
when
poured
in
a
wide
chalice
strong
bourbon
smell
overwhelming
any
malty
or
hoppy
aromas
very
pronouced
bourbon
taste
with
soft
but
complex
oak
tannins
and
crisp
malt
finish
a
light
but
sharp
carbonation
that
brings
out
a
burn
from
the
high
alcohol
content
reminiscent
of
whiskeybourbonscotch
but
with
much
less
grimace
i
love
anjeo
tequillas
but
i
have
yet
to
get
into
whiskeybourbonscotch
and
in
fact
despise
jd
however
this
beer
was
very
interesting
and
quite
delicious
i
bet
it
goes
excellent
with
barbeque
and
intend
to
find
out

d
as
is
often
true
with
beers
of
this
style
you
need
to
let
it
sit
and
warm
up
a
bit
to
get
the
true
value
of
the
beer
it
deepens
as
you
wait
still
not
a
beer
i
want
all
night
drinkability
is
above
average
but
this
is
a
very
robust
and
boozy
tripel
that
begets
respect
but
theres
not
denying
its
addictiveness
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
every
time
ive
had
this
ive
been
less
then
impressed
taking
my
time
with
the
whole
bottle
has
lead
me
to
really
want
to
milk
those
last
few
ml
overall
a
very
tasty
very
pleasant
beer
but
absolutely
not
worth
the
16
i
can
get
equal
and
better
beers
in
22
ounce
bombers
for
half
of
the
price
i
guess
i
feel
like
the
base
tripel
is
somewhat
thin
and
lacking
of
character
and
the
bourbon
aging
is
all
that
makes
it
interesting
easy
to
drink
but
for
a
beer
which
should
be
exploding
with
character
and
depth
and
interesting
flavors
its
well
not
im
glad
i
tasted
it
once
but
definitely
wouldnt
pay
for
it
again
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
served
in
a
chalice
nice
golden
hazy
orange
with
a
lacy
white
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
streamers
sending
bubbles
throughout
nose
is
deliciously
spicy
like
hops
and
curry
sauce
with
a
bit
of
a
barnhay
smell
interlaced
taste
is
quite
good
with
a
slightly
honey
sweetness
very
mild
hops
and
alcohol
coming
through
on
the
end
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
despite
the
dangerous
11
abv
another
nice
brew
from
allagash
finishes
with
just
the
slightest
alcohol
bite
but
is
way
too
drinkable
enjoy
period
i
had
this
at
the
lunar
brewery
in
villa
park
illinois
outside
of
chicago
golden
in
color
and
slightly
cloudy
light
fruity
aroma
with
a
hint
of
wood
or
oak
bourbonwhiskey
in
flavor
with
a
sugary
taste
as
well
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
amazing
beer
there
is
a
clear
consistency
problem
here
as
i
rated
my
initial
bottle
very
high
and
was
quite
disappointed
by
the
second
one
the
11
percent
alcohol
and
oaklaced
flavors
make
this
trippel
unique
it
pours
a
pale
golden
but
still
slightly
ruddy
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
all
oak
classic
belgiany
trippel
flavor
up
front
with
notes
of
honey
whiskey
and
oak
throughoutand
an
alcoholwarmed
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
thats
not
normally
a
plus
for
me
but
the
experience
is
bolstered
by
that
intense
alcohol
presence
and
the
oak
so
id
call
it
delicate
but
earthy
nothing
else
quite
like
this
out
there
and
along
with
another
entry
in
this
allagash
line
the
musette
these
ales
could
obsolete
wine
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
was
worth
the
wait
and
it
was
worth
searching
out
it
is
a
very
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
d
wow
after
18th
of
a
glass
i
was
feeling
the
punch
from
this
great
sipping
belgian
style
thanks
to
limesmut
for
this
beer
pours
a
burnt
copper
color
with
a
massive
threefinger
white
rocky
head
lacing
left
through
the
finish
aroma
is
slighlty
sweet
with
a
definite
bourbonwood
taste
also
has
strong
notes
of
bourbon
fruitiness
with
a
slightly
noticeable
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
there
is
a
definite
alcohol
presence
drying
out
my
tongue
an
excellent
brew
that
gets
even
more
complex
as
it
warms
highly
recommended
d
wow
this
has
a
wonderful
flavor
great
mouthfeel
and
it
delivers
what
it
promises
a
smooth
rich
aged
tripel
a
nice
complement
to
its
brother
tripel
from
allagash
and
an
excellent
cousin
to
the
finest
tripels
from
belgium
however
the
price
per
unit
of
joy
is
unbalanced
compared
to
others
with
comparable
and
at
times
better
qualities
this
alone
diminishes
this
fine
brews
drinkability
i
suggest
trying
this
beer
with
some
friends
in
a
relaxed
setting
not
a
hot
day
or
a
ballpark
beer
bottled
in
november
2006
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
large
billowy
fluffy
and
bright
white
lacing
is
thorough
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
flowers
anise
bourbon
and
oak
the
balance
between
tripel
and
bourbon
is
perfect
the
taste
has
more
bourbon
and
oak
than
the
aroma
but
is
not
over
the
top
bourbon
is
noticable
right
of
the
bat
but
then
the
citruc
floral
and
anise
notes
kick
in
and
add
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
silky
in
texture
and
has
fine
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
an
interesting
beer
i
cannot
recall
having
a
bourbon
aged
belgain
style
beer
before
this
might
be
the
most
genuinely
american
interpretation
of
a
belgain
style
on
the
market
and
i
like
it
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
final
statement
a
great
beer
i
would
think
if
youre
only
going
to
have
one
on
a
cold
rainy
night
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
corked
bottle
and
drink
er
with
an
upmann
i
have
this
in
my
beer
cellar
going
back
to
the
original
release
i
love
how
this
tastes
and
its
only
gotten
better
with
time
that
said
i
had
a
may
2007
bottle
last
night
and
way
overkill
on
the
jim
beam
it
tasted
like
the
tripel
with
too
much
bourbon
in
it
if
you
like
jim
beam
then
youll
love
this
beer
otherwise
id
stash
a
couple
of
the
may
relase
away
for
a
few
years
then
come
back
to
it
or
buy
an
older
release
for
a
more
subtle
brew
d
its
good
it
would
be
great
if
it
werent
for
the
strong
phenolic
alcohol
but
i
recommend
trying
it
certainly
the
11
is
evident
in
smell
and
taste
but
not
really
taken
into
account
while
consuming
as
it
goes
down
with
ease
that
said
the
bourbon
that
is
there
does
hamper
a
bit
of
its
overall
downability
but
not
enough
to
really
take
away
from
the
performance
at
handbottle
a
very
solid
offering
from
allagash
ultimately
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
hardly
as
impressive
as
i
was
hoping
and
expecting
from
allagash
again
im
not
sure
the
oak
adds
that
much
to
the
beer
and
might
just
detract
from
it
oh
well
750ml
corked
caged
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
little
or
no
head
and
very
little
to
do
when
the
cork
is
popped
the
smell
though
rocks
like
sammy
hagar
apricots
apples
rum
lemons
and
sweet
jeebus
my
mouth
is
watering
the
taste
is
right
up
there
the
fruits
are
there
but
so
is
a
nice
oak
sour
mash
backing
that
provides
fantastic
balance
wow
wow
wow
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
bordering
on
chewy
a
remarkable
achievement
for
a
tripel
more
carbonation
than
the
cork
hinted
at
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
strong
flavors
and
healthy
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
great
the
alcohol
comes
on
very
strongly
in
the
finish
perhaps
limiting
ones
ability
to
call
this
perfectly
drinkable
but
dear
sweet
holy
cow
get
some
of
this
and
get
me
some
while
youre
at
it
enjoyed
maybe
a
bit
too
young
bottle
poured
an
unfiltered
cloudy
body
odd
for
an
aged
beer
let
alone
an
oak
aged
beer
there
was
no
doubt
it
was
whiskeybourbon
aged
as
pointing
to
the
large
buttery
hints
exploding
at
the
half
and
finish
very
refreshing
beginning
definitley
need
to
try
it
again
maybe
in
3
or
4
years
it
was
spot
on
for
the
style
and
definition
of
the
beer
this
beer
is
definitely
unique
so
it
is
hard
to
rate
using
the
scale
the
beer
pours
a
pretty
nice
carbonated
white
frothy
head
with
sweet
alcohol
notes
in
the
nose
the
lacing
is
prodigious
there
is
also
a
vinous
smell
and
it
reminds
me
of
some
chardonnays
ive
had
that
have
been
aged
in
wooden
casks
the
smell
is
definitely
vinous
and
noticeably
wine
like
the
alcohol
is
sweet
strong
and
biting
the
taste
is
floral
wine
like
medium
bodied
and
very
unique
the
bourbon
aged
in
wooden
casks
taste
is
ever
present
and
provides
a
sharp
taste
not
all
that
pleasing
but
not
bad
either
there
is
a
distinctive
after
taste
that
also
reminds
me
of
wine
and
it
lingers
well
beyond
what
you
would
expect
from
a
beer
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
but
it
is
interesting
and
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
initially
i
had
this
ridiculously
mispaired
with
the
monks
roquefortrochefort
filet
mignon
this
steak
just
completely
kicked
the
beers
ass
and
probably
mucked
up
my
tasting
i
can
think
of
worse
things
than
having
to
rerate
this
though
highly
recommended
too
expensive
but
oh
so
good
d
given
the
alcohol
percentage
its
not
bad
drinkability
still
after
one
750
of
this
and
id
be
pretty
trashed
allagash
keep
making
this
brew
and
to
the
baers
keep
reviewing
this
one
so
that
it
can
get
its
place
in
the
top
100
where
it
deserves
to
be
presentation
packaged
in
a
750
ml
belgian
bottle
with
a
cork
and
cage
served
in
a
belgian
chalice
i
have
since
reviewing
tried
the
beer
again
twice
both
relatively
fresh
samples
and
had
to
come
back
and
up
the
marks
the
beer
really
is
something
to
be
had
well
done
allagash
taste
is
definitely
this
beers
strong
point
but
everything
else
is
well
above
average
i
would
stash
this
away
until
fall
when
the
nights
become
cooler
and
thoughts
deeper
sampled
most
recently
on
draft
at
capones
norristown
pa
during
the
allagash
promo
on
61907
hazy
yellow
with
a
moderate
sized
offwhite
head
complex
aroma
fruit
oak
whisky
and
yeast
most
notable
the
wood
aging
adds
some
interesting
flavors
like
tropical
fruit
whiskey
oak
alcohol
and
yeast
delicious
beer
but
i
think
the
alcohol
overwhelms
the
other
more
delicate
flavors
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
bubbly
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
fruity
and
yeasty
but
more
like
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
than
a
tripel
maybe
the
oak
mellowed
it
out
a
little
more
the
taste
is
also
very
similiar
to
a
belgain
pale
ale
fruit
and
classic
belgain
yeast
with
a
warming
alcohol
finish
not
as
much
bourbon
feel
or
vanilla
from
the
oak
as
i
would
expect
in
fact
i
hardly
picked
any
up
at
all
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
like
i
said
feels
more
like
a
belgain
pale
ale
than
any
tripel
ive
ever
had
golden
body
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
white
head
good
retention
and
the
sexy
lace
belgians
are
famous
for
fruity
smell
with
melons
and
a
kick
of
vanilla
and
an
odd
sour
not
that
i
cant
quite
place
but
do
like
with
an
earthy
hint
it
has
a
nice
rich
body
not
cakey
or
syrupy
but
pleasantly
dry
the
taste
is
more
vanilla
more
grassy
somewhat
sweetened
with
alcohol
but
neither
overpowering
or
burning
wow
one
thing
is
clear
after
one
sip
of
this
beer
you
wont
forget
about
it
pale
radiant
golden
color
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
smells
sweet
almost
like
the
aromas
that
would
come
from
a
bourbon
glaze
taste
is
overwhelmingly
bourbon
moreso
than
the
lost
abbey
bourbonbarrel
ale
i
sampled
previously
butter
and
vanilla
flavors
come
through
with
the
bourbon
and
the
finish
is
at
the
same
time
both
sweet
and
puckering
powerful
stuff
certainly
a
sipping
beer
not
a
swigging
beer
even
my
13oz
pour
was
perhaps
a
bit
much
but
definitely
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
monumental
drink
so
smooth
and
so
delicious
the
growler
between
my
wife
and
i
didnt
survive
the
night
the
flavor
is
so
robust
so
strong
and
profound
that
words
barely
do
it
justice
showstopping
work
from
the
allagash
crew
cheers
d
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
to
sit
down
and
drink
it
is
something
to
be
shared
with
friends
over
dinner
or
something
to
that
effect
it
is
a
power
house
that
i
imagine
could
open
many
a
wine
aficianado
to
the
wonderful
world
of
beer
a
must
have
in
my
opinion
notes
an
interesting
experiment
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
tripel
reserve
on
its
own
the
bourbon
really
overpowers
the
delicacy
of
the
tripel
i
think
this
would
work
better
with
a
bolder
beer
as
a
base
overall
this
beer
is
great
i
am
glad
to
have
gotten
to
try
it
overall
the
recent
trend
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
does
not
always
yield
a
drinkable
product
there
are
a
few
noteworthy
exceptions
and
this
is
among
them
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
worth
seeking
out
i
have
cellared
this
for
about
half
a
year
and
i
suspect
my
remaining
bottle
may
age
for
another
year
or
two
very
nicely
i
wouldnt
drink
it
too
cold
say
much
below
50
degrees
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
nose
and
vanilla
accents
are
not
unduly
supressed
unusual
and
delicious
bright
light
pastel
yellow
totally
cloudy
with
visible
effervescence
the
collar
kept
alive
from
below
the
tiny
microbubbles
add
significantly
to
the
smooth
creamy
mouth
texture
the
smell
is
classic
and
aggressive
tart
citrus
with
harvest
fruit
from
the
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
light
refreshing
smooth
and
creamy
the
taste
doesnt
have
the
same
intense
character
as
the
nose
or
the
mouth
but
it
is
quite
nice
and
oh
by
the
way
the
11
abv
will
take
you
there
very
nice
ive
been
holding
on
to
this
one
for
a
while
now
bottled
in
july
2005
from
one
of
390
cases
golden
peach
with
a
respectable
topping
of
slightly
greying
white
froth
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
skimming
layer
and
ring
estery
aromas
of
tart
apple
cider
chardonnayesque
buttery
green
grape
skins
and
really
only
the
faintest
whiff
of
kentuckys
finest
but
that
bourbon
is
certainly
not
missing
from
the
taste
atop
the
sugary
pineapple
nectar
and
grapeapplemelon
fruit
melange
so
welcome
in
the
best
tripels
rides
an
almost
regal
oaky
bourbon
flavor
with
alcohol
vapor
spirit
breath
lashing
the
palate
toward
a
powerfully
whiskeylaced
finish
pleasant
phenolic
bananapineapple
notes
in
the
aftertaste
light
and
airy
just
like
a
tripel
ought
to
feel
with
of
course
a
very
deceptive
alcohol
content
eminently
drinkable
in
my
estimation
now
what
one
thinks
of
this
beer
will
depend
quite
a
lot
on
ones
feelings
about
bourbon
in
the
example
at
hand
the
latter
will
sneak
up
on
the
drinker
who
doesnt
expect
it
but
those
who
enjoy
and
appreciate
significant
bourbonwhiskey
flavors
in
their
beer
like
myself
will
find
much
to
admire
in
allagashs
curieux
this
one
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
ring
the
aroma
is
a
very
strong
mix
of
sweet
fruit
oak
citrus
hops
yeast
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
an
extremely
complex
blend
of
the
same
flavors
that
blend
together
in
almost
perfect
harmony
the
beer
is
quite
heavy
and
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
present
but
not
too
harsh
for
11
this
is
a
sipper
to
say
the
least
but
an
extremely
enjoyable
one
d
this
is
a
almost
perfect
beer
it
feels
like
everything
comes
out
when
it
is
supposed
to
and
stays
around
for
just
enough
time
has
amazing
complexity
and
nothing
over
powers
the
other
just
a
great
beer
for
some
very
special
occasions
the
only
thing
that
is
keeping
this
drinkability
down
is
the
alcohol
content
strong
but
nice
poured
from
a
750
corked
and
caged
bottle
into
a
my
dt
glass
label
shows
aug
2006
bottling
with
510
cases
bottled
it
opened
with
a
good
pop
and
was
a
clear
golden
honey
color
it
barely
had
a
head
and
that
went
away
quickly
it
also
had
a
steady
small
stream
of
carb
throughout
the
smell
was
very
heavy
on
the
oaked
bourbon
from
the
barrell
it
was
so
dominant
that
no
other
smells
really
came
to
the
front
the
taste
followed
suit
and
it
made
me
think
of
a
bourbon
and
water
more
than
a
beer
this
barrell
trend
is
really
hot
right
now
and
ive
seen
it
done
well
where
it
adds
some
new
flavor
to
the
beer
but
this
one
barely
shows
any
of
the
beer
cant
tell
it
was
a
tripel
except
for
the
identification
here
i
can
see
why
some
might
love
it
but
for
me
its
a
one
and
done
dont
recommend
2
5
na
ml
n
again
ill
have
no
trouble
finishing
this
750
and
again
of
my
recent
foray
into
these
special
allagsh
offerings
my
favorite
is
still
odyssey
drinkability
its
a
biggin
poured
a
cloudy
honeycolored
ale
with
12
inch
head
head
dissipates
quickly
and
lacing
is
relatively
thin
smell
is
mildly
cidery
and
sour
with
little
hop
character
for
a
bourbon
barrelaged
tripel
this
beer
doesnt
really
exhibit
the
aroma
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
taste
is
alcoholic
and
sweet
but
not
overly
flavorful
at
first
however
the
flavor
does
improve
as
the
beer
is
consumed
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
the
flavor
as
i
expected
as
with
smell
the
bourbonbarrel
characteristics
are
not
present
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
flavors
typically
associated
with
a
belgian
tripel
are
present
and
in
this
respect
this
beer
reminds
me
of
one
of
the
unibroue
special
editon
series
mouthfeel
is
warming
and
alcoholic
carbonation
is
crisp
while
not
overly
impressed
with
its
lack
of
bourbon
flavors
this
is
still
a
good
drinkable
beer
albeit
in
limited
quantities
due
to
its
relatively
high
abv
i
will
say
this
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
bourbon
aged
beers
very
nicely
done
allagash
keep
up
the
good
work
drinkability
curieux
was
the
second
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
that
i
have
tasted
previously
tasted
abs
winters
bourbon
cask
ale
and
found
it
way
better
than
abs
offering
not
in
the
same
league
the
ale
flavors
came
through
and
the
bourbon
and
oak
vanillins
were
well
balanced
curieux
makes
a
very
nice
selection
for
a
special
occasion
try
it
instead
of
wine
or
champagne
pours
a
cloudy
hazy
light
gold
thin
white
head
that
splits
to
islands
of
thin
foam
smells
of
a
serious
belgian
sweet
honey
some
vanilla
very
slight
bourbon
notes
tastes
again
of
a
good
belgian
sweet
honey
with
some
raisins
vanilla
slight
bourbon
comes
through
as
it
warms
this
brew
seriously
needs
to
be
served
at
cellar
temp
i
opened
it
way
too
cold
and
didnt
get
much
but
as
it
warmed
it
came
alive
completely
different
brew
the
warmth
lets
the
alcohol
bourbon
vanilla
come
through
much
better
a
brew
very
well
done
an
authentic
belgian
ale
for
sure
i
think
the
time
this
beer
spent
in
my
cellar
helped
soften
the
alcohol
burn
and
tame
the
burbon
flavor
as
it
warmed
in
my
glass
different
flavors
came
through
with
each
sip
ive
got
to
get
a
couple
more
bottles
to
drink
now
and
age
for
later
d
excellent
drinkability
the
bourbon
barrel
paired
the
triple
makes
it
a
must
have
allagash
does
a
great
job
with
this
brew
it
took
some
time
but
in
the
end
this
beer
has
won
me
over
and
if
i
can
track
it
down
i
will
definitely
buy
more
bottles
try
it
you
will
not
be
disappointed
i
definitely
was
not
mdlight
body
and
strong
carbonation
okay
to
drink
but
there
isnt
much
here
isnt
the
oxidized
bomb
that
i
was
fearing
nice
carbonation
for
the
age
overall
impression
easy
but
firm
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
and
after
reading
opinions
in
the
cellaring
forum
voting
against
holding
this
one
i
feel
it
stood
up
well
to
what
i
gave
it
time
wise
ill
be
looking
for
more
to
hold
curieux
had
three
huge
things
going
for
it
right
off
the
bat
its
brewed
by
allagash
it
uses
tripel
reserve
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
as
its
base
beer
and
its
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
my
favorite
liquor
therefore
im
not
the
least
bit
surprised
that
ive
been
gobsmacked
yet
again
if
you
like
beautifully
crafted
amazingly
delicious
belgianstyle
ales
with
an
american
flair
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
allagash
curieux
the
second
beer
from
my
four
beer
sampler
at
the
sunset
grill
and
tap
5
oz
in
a
miniature
pokal
it
appears
a
hazed
straw
with
light
carbonation
and
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
tropical
mostly
orange
and
pineapple
with
an
oakyvanilla
kick
quite
distinct
it
is
also
quite
tropical
on
the
palate
with
orange
pineapple
peach
melon
rind
and
banana
along
with
notes
of
wheat
green
hops
yeast
vanilla
oak
and
a
peppery
character
the
body
is
medium
and
very
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
and
finish
its
also
dangerously
drinkable
hiding
the
alcohol
well
and
i
especially
like
what
the
bourbon
has
done
to
this
brew
recommended
i
wish
i
had
a
bottle
for
aging
slightly
hazy
golden
colour
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
hue
and
an
incredibly
dense
bright
white
head
the
thick
foam
produced
a
ton
of
solid
chunky
lacing
made
up
of
extremely
small
bubbles
the
aroma
was
very
fruity
some
papaya
and
mango
with
definite
oak
and
vanilla
character
just
a
little
boozy
too
likewise
the
flavour
was
heavy
on
the
fruit
very
tropical
with
plenty
of
papaya
and
tart
pineapple
notes
of
vanilla
swam
in
and
out
of
focus
and
oak
was
prominent
along
with
a
woody
alcohol
warmth
reminiscent
of
finer
whiskeys
although
it
was
quite
sweet
there
was
a
solid
bitterness
underneath
it
all
full
bodied
and
palate
coating
it
didnt
quite
end
up
sticky
the
carbonation
was
finely
integrated
and
produced
a
creamy
texture
that
led
into
a
dry
finish
this
is
truly
great
stuff
from
allagash
the
combination
of
fruitiness
and
wood
aging
really
worked
well
together
thanks
matt
mouthfeeldrinkability
exquisite
development
in
the
mouth
from
beginning
to
end
the
initial
subtle
carbonation
becomes
impossibly
creamy
and
remains
so
throughout
appeared
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
filled
with
bubbles
aromas
of
hops
yeast
and
mellons
the
taste
was
fruitfilled
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
vanilla
malt
and
hop
flavors
dominated
the
finish
quite
creamy
and
textured
smooth
and
mellow
with
plenty
of
depth
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
it
didnt
present
itself
in
both
appearance
and
smell
as
well
as
it
tasted
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
beer
with
such
high
abv
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
good
candidate
for
the
cellar
as
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
very
strong
ale
more
of
the
tripel
elements
showed
themselves
to
me
in
the
forms
of
malts
and
hops
with
great
drinkability
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
gold
color
and
formed
a
bubbly
white
head
the
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
citrus
with
a
hint
of
bourbon
in
the
background
the
flavor
was
of
citrus
a
hint
of
caramel
and
chocolate
the
body
was
medium
light
with
a
slight
creamy
aspect
to
it
a
sweet
finish
to
it
not
a
bad
beer
that
could
probably
age
well

mouthfeel
is
slightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
smooth
warming
vanilla
and
spice
flow
across
the
palate
finishes
semi
dry
with
bourbon
and
oak
resonating
and
making
me
lick
my
lips
awaiting
the
next
sip
golden
to
light
copper
color
and
a
white
head
quickly
diminishing
to
some
scant
lacing
aromas
display
big
woodsy
oak
barrel
characters
earthiness
golden
apples
soft
fruits
and
something
lactic
like
yogurt
large
alcoholic
burn
dominates
beer
along
with
oaky
bourbon
flavor
vanilla
and
bananas
ba
spice
characters
meld
well
with
those
of
the
tripel
but
as
it
warms
they
seem
to
consume
the
other
flavors
typical
tripel
mouthfeel
thin
fizzy
carbonation
lots
of
alcohol
and
bourbon
in
the
finish
before
i
finish
the
bottle
all
i
can
taste
is
sweet
sweet
sweet
aspartame
and
bourbon
just
couldnt
appreciate
much
of
the
tripels
nuances
maybe
some
extensive
aging
would
do
this
better
justice
d
this
beer
could
use
some
age
but
its
nice
now
with
23
years
under
its
belt
this
would
be
really
superb
as
it
warms
the
fruit
gets
really
sweet
and
the
bourbon
really
expands
in
caliber
although
it
becomes
more
flavorful
it
also
becomes
more
cloying
d
this
is
a
great
one
to
share
the
sweetness
from
the
tripel
blends
nicely
with
the
bourbon
very
smooth
one
word
of
caution
if
you
dont
like
whisky
do
not
try
this
one
it
has
all
the
great
flavors
of
it
without
the
harsh
alcohol
burn
to
be
honest
not
my
favorite
combo
but
interesting
none
the
less
i
applaud
allagash
for
trying
something
out
of
the
norm
this
beer
also
has
a
fantastic
balance
of
fruity
belgian
flavor
hints
of
bourbon
and
alcohol
i
love
bourbon
and
this
was
a
perfect
marriage
of
the
two
libations
this
is
a
beer
that
will
also
become
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
up
if
you
cant
taste
the
bourbon
give
it
some
time
and
youll
start
to
notice
it
towards
the
end
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
tripels
are
pretty
rare
around
these
parts
readearth
and
this
is
my
first
looks
like
a
dark
tripel
good
sized
head
smell
is
very
yeasty
and
malty
an
unearthly
amount
of
that
good
bourbonoakey
smell
the
taste
is
also
very
different
yeast
first
bourbon
and
alcohol
sting
like
a
shot
of
whiskey
rises
and
falls
leaving
an
earthy
flavor
i
have
never
had
a
beer
like
this
maybe
not
the
best
use
of
barrelaging
but
certainly
worth
a
shot
378
cases
bottled
9072
bottles
and
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
hold
of
one
by
total
chance
i
had
never
heard
of
it
before
but
couldnt
pass
by
it
when
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
allagash
with
casks
what
more
to
ask
for
beautiful
if
you
enjoy
either
of
these
overall
i
tried
this
a
few
years
ago
2006
and
have
now
updated
my
review
the
feb
2011
bottling
consumed
in
apr
2011
either
the
beer
has
changed
a
lot
for
the
better
or
my
palate
is
different
but
this
is
a
lot
more
balanced
than
my
previous
experience
really
like
the
way
the
bourbon
and
tripel
flavors
have
merged
to
create
a
delightful
synergy
pours
looking
like
well
carbonated
honey
gold
that
really
glows
hosts
a
huge
offwhite
head
nose
is
a
creamy
wheat
and
citrus
balance
enters
the
mouth
rich
with
a
strong
oiley
wheat
tone
includes
a
sour
syrupy
feel
on
the
main
part
of
the
palate
this
beer
balances
beter
and
mellows
out
as
it
warms
a
bit
the
long
soured
wheat
feel
is
the
dominating
attribute
to
this
beer
the
alchol
is
well
hidden
drinks
pretty
well
overall
but
for
16
a
bottle
i
was
expecting
much
more
a
slightly
hazy
beer
honey
golden
with
a
small
bubbly
off
white
head
the
nose
is
alcoholic
with
woodyness
vanilla
and
a
little
fruityness
the
taste
is
like
straight
forward
alcohol
but
not
totally
harsh
its
warming
balanced
out
with
vanilla
wood
and
fruit
again
has
a
thick
slick
mouthfeel
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
but
the
alcohol
does
repeat
a
bit
750
ml
bottle
purchased
from
whole
foods
about
a
year
ago
my
first
review
dont
kill
me
because
it
sucks
p
this
beer
has
aged
nicely
its
become
much
more
rounded
and
focused
than
i
initially
remember
it
where
the
fruitiness
seemed
to
want
to
express
a
sharper
more
juicytart
side
and
the
vanillacandyish
malt
fluffed
over
it
perhaps
its
dried
out
a
little
bit
and
now
the
two
sides
have
come
a
little
bit
closer
together
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
try
a
year
from
now
impressive
mouthfeel
a
little
bubbly
but
sweet
with
some
complex
oakeyness
with
hinst
of
evan
williams
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
accented
by
the
smell
of
bourbon
the
taste
is
like
a
tripel
but
without
the
hop
bitterness
which
is
replaced
by
the
sweet
taste
of
bourbon
the
mouth
is
light
with
a
low
level
of
carbination
a
drinkable
yet
very
different
tasting
beer
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
but
im
not
that
in
to
barrel
aging
of
most
beers
the
word
that
first
springs
to
mind
is
interesting
and
id
follow
that
with
blended
crafted
unique
and
quite
good
the
bourbon
presence
is
surprisingly
strong
but
it
meshes
almost
seamlessly
with
everything
else
the
abv
is
muscular
and
has
a
spirit
quality
but
its
all
part
of
the
drinkable
show
put
it
like
this
id
like
to
know
which
bourbon
aged
in
this
barrel
first
because
it
goes
damned
well
with
this
beer
drinkability
i
had
the
abv
listed
as
9
5
on
my
excel
sheet
and
thought
that
it
didnt
even
feel
that
high
then
i
looked
at
the
bottle
and
saw
its
actually
11
super
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
flavorful
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
another
big
winner
from
allagash
thanks
much
steven
really
enjoyed
this
tremendous
beer
very
bold
and
vibrant
from
the
color
to
the
finish
begins
with
a
hazy
hefeweizen
hue
but
with
a
firm
belgian
strong
pale
ale
aroma
twangy
belgian
yeast
with
good
pilsner
malts
and
candied
along
with
carying
mild
woodsy
rounded
aromas
as
well
flavors
show
more
soft
belgian
character
with
witlike
flavors
and
textures
before
the
imense
alcohols
kick
in
the
fruity
pears
apricots
pineapples
and
berries
rest
on
a
cookie
dough
maltiness
the
oak
rounds
out
the
rough
edges
nicely
but
the
bourbon
flavors
never
rise
they
may
provide
a
light
vanilla
and
coconut
flavor
but
they
are
slight
the
cottony
feel
is
contrasted
by
thinning
alcohols
the
heat
displays
nutral
qualities
not
phenolic
or
fusal
plain
and
simply
warm
finishes
powdery
and
dry
with
a
refreshing
citrus
lingering
very
good
brew
i
highly
recommend
but
not
for
the
bourbon
character
fairly
good
drinkability
but
especially
good
not
to
take
away
from
this
beer
thogh
it
is
very
good
and
very
unique
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
goes
down
so
easily
and
is
actually
quite
refreshing
this
is
almost
deceptively
drinkable
at
over
9
abv
i
could
be
in
trouble
before
i
know
it
with
this
one
a
treat
to
drink
im
sad
this
is
my
only
bottle
hopefully
i
will
come
across
this
beer
again
cheers
to
allagash
for
creating
a
jim
beam
barrel
aged
work
of
art
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
wish
i
had
another
one
already
the
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
you
cant
even
pick
up
on
the
fact
that
it
is
pushing
10
alcohol
the
wood
aging
definitely
changes
this
beer
i
am
assuming
that
this
is
their
regular
triple
so
the
barrel
makes
the
characteristics
of
the
triple
a
lot
more
muted
their
original
triple
was
really
fresh
and
fruity
with
a
really
clean
and
sweet
bite
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
much
more
complex
and
refined
it
assaults
the
palate
with
respect
just
a
note
i
got
this
when
this
first
came
out
been
in
my
basement
since
bottle
says
it
was
bottled
on
september
2004
a
very
complex
and
intricate
offering
delicately
balanced
so
that
the
bourbon
flavor
doesnt
overpower
the
tripels
natural
flavors
drinkability
is
tough
since
the
alcohol
content
does
pack
a
punch
this
one
is
best
enjoyed
when
shared
with
someone
who
can
appreciate
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
brews
when
i
saw
this
i
had
to
buy
it
this
pours
a
darkish
gold
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
a
alcoholbourbon
and
oak
aged
aroma
the
smell
is
something
special
the
bourbon
taste
is
alot
stronger
than
i
expected
i
like
thisbut
if
you
dont
like
bourbon
dont
try
it
like
the
smell
the
taste
has
a
full
alcohol
and
whiskey
flavor
the
oak
wood
brings
out
a
earthy
and
vanilla
flavor
that
is
really
outstanding
the
mf
is
medium
with
a
range
of
flavors
that
mix
perfectly
this
beer
is
one
for
the
ages
and
if
you
can
find
it
buy
it
i
love
this
beer
for
my
tastes
the
bourbon
influence
is
way
overdone
it
is
an
interesting
beer
but
its
one
i
just
dont
care
for
it
was
certainly
an
interesting
beer
and
worth
a
try
i
prefer
their
triple
though
my
preferences
in
oak
barrel
aging
appear
to
be
towards
aging
impy
stouts
and
barleywines
the
body
is
uber
creamy
and
thick
with
a
bit
of
a
sting
from
the
bourbon
at
the
finish
very
smooth
i
like
it
alot
and
i
will
definitely
seek
out
another
bottle
in
the
future
light
orange
color
with
a
full
belgianesque
covering
foam
aroma
is
mostly
bourbon
alcohol
and
a
few
woody
elements
dry
toasted
oak
vanilla
but
some
belgian
elements
remain
although
i
would
suggest
the
wafting
rather
than
deeply
inhaling
the
compounds
giving
a
lightly
fruity
yeasty
touch
flavor
is
predominantly
bourbon
and
booze
with
a
vanilla
and
cask
wood
flavor
and
an
ungodly
rich
body
which
does
improve
the
beer
some
belgianesque
triple
elements
remain
providing
a
slight
hint
of
belgian
yeast
and
fruit
but
it
really
is
very
unbalanced
i
still
find
it
pretty
enjoyable
however
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
even
though
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
especially
as
it
warms
i
could
enjoy
more
than
one
bottle
but
it
will
be
over
a
long
evening
must
try
this
beer
the
beer
after
its
disemboguing
from
the
22ounce
cork
and
caged
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
honeyed
gold
color
the
head
is
meaningful
in
size
the
texture
creamy
and
the
color
a
pleasant
off
white
after
its
depletion
the
lace
forms
a
fine
coating
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
citrus
like
crispness
hints
of
alcohol
corn
and
a
vanilla
like
tone
quite
a
sniffer
this
one
start
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
purposeful
grain
profile
the
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
sternly
acidic
the
hops
bashed
by
the
alcohol
quite
dry
vinous
and
a
definite
tummy
warming
noticed
a
real
hoot
just
got
to
love
the
brewers
at
allagash
they
certainly
know
how
to
put
together
one
hell
of
a
line
of
beers
bottle
poured
a
hazy
real
hazy
i
just
cant
see
through
my
glass
golden
color
ale
with
a
medium
bubbly
white
head
with
minimum
retention
aroma
of
bourbon
is
quiet
easy
to
detect
but
also
some
real
funky
yeast
is
present
which
remind
of
a
saison
or
even
a
lambic
without
the
sourness
though
taste
is
a
bit
too
sharp
in
alcohol
at
first
which
kind
of
ruin
it
for
me
since
i
dont
like
the
warming
feeling
but
you
get
used
to
it
and
it
seems
to
disappear
or
i
might
just
be
getting
drunk
and
then
i
can
see
some
traces
of
a
nice
abbey
tripel
with
a
strong
yeast
profile
which
provide
a
farmhouse
side
that
i
really
enjoyed
overall
probably
not
something
i
would
go
for
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
still
enjoyed
if
i
was
to
rate
on
experiment
alone
though
i
would
have
rated
this
much
higher
since
i
appreciated
the
fact
that
allagash
tried
to
do
something
different
cheers
drinkability
a
great
oakaged
beer
that
will
give
your
temperance
skills
a
challenge
this
id
a
wonderful
beer
it
pours
a
dark
yellow
without
too
much
of
a
head
there
is
some
lacing
but
not
a
lot
it
has
a
spicyfruity
odor
to
it
the
taste
is
complex
fruit
spice
and
a
darker
backtaste
its
feels
great
in
the
mouth
not
too
carbonated
a
really
great
beer
to
drink
body
is
medium
with
a
smooth
creamy
texture
and
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
brought
on
by
high
carbonation
too
much
booze
and
bourbon
to
make
this
highly
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
taste
and
smell
treat
however
one
of
these
and
i
am
done
for
a
while
i
wonder
how
another
year
will
affect
this
beer
perhaps
i
will
find
out
notes
these
bourbon
type
brews
are
tough
some
peppery
content
came
through
late
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
just
seemed
like
a
watered
down
black
velvet
blend
a
very
interesting
beer
it
poured
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
little
cloudiness
to
it
and
a
small
white
head
that
lingered
till
the
last
sip
the
smell
right
away
was
full
of
vanilla
alchohol
and
bourbon
the
taste
was
very
unique
it
started
out
like
a
tripple
with
a
bit
of
frutiness
and
malt
sweetness
and
then
as
you
are
about
to
swallow
the
oak
barrel
characteristics
kick
in
the
vanilla
sweetness
comes
around
and
finnishes
with
a
very
smoothe
makers
markesque
flavor
after
pouring
the
yeast
from
the
bottle
the
flavor
had
a
little
more
sweetness
an
frutiness
i
would
suggest
setting
the
bottle
on
the
side
for
a
bit
and
letting
all
the
yeast
mix
in
as
it
yields
a
more
flaverfull
beer
imo
but
it
is
defiantly
recommedned
nonetheless
dull
blonde
no
head
at
all
good
clarity
but
at
least
a
collar
of
foam
would
be
nice
rich
complex
aroma
sweetish
with
an
underlying
barrel
aged
scent
a
bit
boozy
with
a
very
pleasant
vanilla
overtone
the
bourbon
is
nicely
placed
noticable
but
not
overpowering
the
beery
delicious
tripel
character
the
bourbon
mixes
with
the
fruity
tripel
character
to
create
something
not
unlike
coconut
fruity
lots
of
pineapple
quite
tropical
nicely
placed
subtler
bourbon
flavor
the
tripel
still
leads
supplemented
with
oaky
vanilla
goodness
a
fruity
flavor
i
can
only
describe
as
coconut
the
sweet
kind
of
coconut
in
a
mounds
bar
fruity
and
sugary
plenty
of
pineapple
and
other
tropical
fruit
the
finish
is
mostly
dominated
by
the
bourbon
contributing
a
booziness
that
only
grows
as
the
glass
warms
oaky
vanilla
a
bit
of
smoky
phenols
with
some
spicy
belgian
yeast
quality
medium
bodied
with
moderate
fine
bubbled
carbonation
as
the
beer
nears
room
temperature
the
booze
gets
a
little
too
strong
for
me
gathering
a
lot
of
heat
in
the
swallow
the
last
quarter
of
the
glass
being
a
very
slow
sipper
still
one
of
the
better
bourbonaged
beers
classy
subtler
and
very
tasty
drinkability
one
of
them
this
is
a
beer
kind
of
beers
i
was
skeptical
of
tripel
bourbon
no
longer
awesome
beer
that
forces
you
to
sip
it
slowly
savor
a
well
done
and
delicately
balanced
triple
with
an
interesting
addition
of
oak
and
vanilla
imparted
in
subtle
terms
slightly
under
carbonated
and
heavy
distinct
smell
of
belgian
yeast
this
was
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
and
something
to
behold
enjoy
at
slightly
cold
and
experience
new
flavors
and
smells
as
it
warms
easy
drinking
and
not
too
heavy
the
alcohol
hides
behind
it
all
making
for
a
ultimately
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
as
i
can
only
find
this
in
one
specific
location
a
nearby
bar
i
will
be
trying
this
again
sometime
in
the
near
future
probably
near
christmas
i
look
forward
to
the
opportunity
an
excellent
complex
beer
to
be
savored
what
am
i
going
to
do
without
the
blind
tiger
yet
another
gem
that
was
part
of
the
vsk
night
i
was
absolutely
floored
by
the
sheer
originality
of
this
beer
it
retained
all
the
characters
of
a
tripel
the
smooth
dry
fruity
palate
hints
of
creamsicle
and
yet
constantly
my
nose
and
tongue
were
convinced
i
was
enjoying
a
snifter
of
good
kentucky
sipping
bourbon
curious
indeed
there
were
notes
of
vanilla
and
just
a
hint
of
smoke
that
tickled
my
nose
and
rolled
off
the
back
of
my
tongue
and
i
swear
there
was
the
distinct
warming
sensation
i
get
when
partaking
in
any
type
of
scotch
or
whisky
derivitive
quite
a
wonderful
beer
though
i
cant
imagine
drinking
too
much
of
it
three
cheers
for
allagash
highly
recommended
but
still
a
truly
delicious
offering
a
nice
beer
that
is
warming
on
this
early
fall
evening
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
if
this
is
your
style
cost
to
pleasure
ratio
is
pretty
low
11

a
bottle
curieux
is
presented
in
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
caged
cork
mine
is
listed
as
being
bottled
in
july
2005
and
with
an
abv
of
11
unlike
the
9
5
listed
above
the
cork
releases
with
an
audible
pop
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
1cm
white
head
into
my
chimay
chalice
the
head
soon
fades
to
an
islade
of
white
foam
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
aroma
is
floral
with
some
honey
and
some
spices
in
there
as
well
taste
is
spicy
with
cloves
and
coriander
and
maybe
some
orange
peel
with
a
heavy
contribution
of
vanilla
and
other
bourbon
like
flavors
slick
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
hot
alcoholic
finish
definitely
feels
like
it
is
every
bit
of
the
11
listed
on
the
bottle
in
fact
without
the
alcohol
feel
this
would
be
one
easy
drinking
beer
a
fine
american
tripel
really
a
fine
beer
love
it
wish
i
had
more
man
just
another
really
great
beer
from
allagash
personally
i
think
allagash
takes
ommegang
easily
in
the
belgianamerican
category
very
nice
golden
orange
color
the
head
quickly
receedes
from
a
huge
snow
white
fluff
into
a
thin
18
layer
big
malty
and
vinuous
aroma
i
get
more
wine
then
anything
resembling
bourbon
some
oak
and
yeast
the
flavor
however
is
quite
bourbon
laced
i
liken
it
more
to
single
malt
scotch
then
a
bourbon
but
the
whiskeybourbon
presence
is
right
there
decent
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
somewhat
sweet
as
well
no
real
hop
bitterness
its
realy
all
oveshadowed
by
the
oak
and
bourbon
flavors
good
mouthfeel
i
have
to
knock
down
the
dinkability
a
bit
as
i
dont
know
how
much
of
this
i
could
consume
in
a
sitting
or
evening
very
well
done
and
interesting
beerjust
not
something
i
could
consume
a
lot
of
or
very
often
well
worth
a
try
overall
the
hop
flavor
was
too
muted
to
make
the
flavor
complex
i
did
perceive
a
lot
of
malt
but
without
the
carbonation
and
nice
texture
or
hop
flavor
i
thought
this
beer
was
too
onedimensional
drinkability
is
good
but
it
helps
that
i
like
bourbon
non
bourbon
drinkers
will
probably
be
turned
off
fairly
clear
golden
orange
body
with
a
tall
foamy
white
head
some
scattered
light
lacing
was
left
around
the
glass
aroma
was
a
mix
of
sweet
fruits
and
strong
bourbon
alcohol
notes
there
was
minimal
spice
as
well
but
the
more
this
warmed
the
more
the
alcohol
and
bourbon
drowned
out
everything
else
taste
was
more
of
the
same
too
much
bourbon
and
alcohol
to
let
anything
else
but
some
sweetness
gets
through
there
were
light
fruit
and
spice
notes
but
as
the
bottle
warmed
the
alcohol
became
even
more
evident
very
unpleasant
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
really
dig
their
standard
triple
but
this
was
way
too
hot
to
enjoy
i
figured
it
might
have
mellowed
some
but
that
was
not
the
case
mouthfeel
was
solid
drinkability
was
shot
to
hell
by
the
alcohol
seems
like
triples
and
bourbon
barreling
dont
mix
well
pours
out
a
golden
yellow
with
a
little
orange
tinge
a
nice
foamy
white
head
on
this
one
smells
like
straight
up
burboun
but
if
you
smell
closer
you
can
smell
belgian
yeast
aromas
there
is
definitely
a
belgian
beer
in
there
tastes
like
grain
alcohol
this
stuff
is
pretty
stiff
actually
some
vanilla
and
coconut
flavors
are
present
basically
burboun
its
not
bad
but
i
wont
more
tripple
here
you
can
feel
the
burn
in
your
mouth
with
this
stuff
alright
and
different
but
not
stellar
the
smell
is
interesting
and
very
very
good
bourbon
comes
through
plain
and
clear
on
top
of
light
malts
and
a
touch
of
citrus
the
taste
is
good
as
well
oak
comes
out
lightly
while
bourbon
remains
strong
on
top
of
the
pale
malts
and
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
very
appealing
drinkability
takes
a
slight
hit
for
the
alcohol
but
remains
fairly
high
this
is
an
intense
beer
i
liked
it
but
expected
more
at
roughly
15
i
doubt
i
will
get
this
again
as
the
bottle
says
i
expect
this
will
improve
with
age
but
i
aint
got
the
patience
or
the
space
as
it
is
its
drinkable
though
definitely
a
sippin
beer
recommended
for
whiskey
fans
but
not
your
typical
beer
by
a
kentucky
mile
what
can
i
say
im
floored
all
over
again
my
thanks
to
nick
at
bauer
wine
for
mentioning
that
this
ale
still
tastes
great
and
kicks
ass
i
would
be
drinking
alot
less
great
beer
without
your
suggestions
bro
drinkability
this
beer
is
absolutely
delectable
wonderfully
smooth
with
a
balanced
and
complex
flavor
other
brewers
should
strive
to
brew
something
this
good
overall
a
nice
experiment
from
allagash
very
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
im
not
sure
that
it
was
worth
the
15
99
i
paid
for
it
nevertheless
i
bought
it
like
3
months
ago
and
its
been
cellaring
since
so
im
not
that
upset
drinkability
suffers
only
because
of
the
abv
and
the
intensity
of
the
bourbon
flavors
i
cannot
wait
to
try
the
odyssey
i
am
profoundly
grateful
to
have
had
the
oppurtunity
to
try
this
delicious
creation
and
thank
unclejimbo
for
providing
wish
i
could
have
a
case
in
the
cellar
for
future
tastings
pours
orange
peach
with
a
small
white
head
that
coats
the
glass
nicely
smells
of
charcoal
and
bourbon
banana
spicy
and
peppery
some
mild
fruity
esters
and
citric
notes
and
an
excellent
musty
oak
aroma
wow
is
this
a
complex
brew
tastes
very
spicy
extremely
evident
bourbon
flavor
and
alcohol
kick
very
warming
almost
overpowering
bready
notes
with
some
citric
tones
and
some
sugary
sweetness
hidden
under
the
alcohol
burn
maybe
some
tart
apple
and
sweet
peaches
like
i
said
very
complex
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
with
a
little
carbonation
tickle
a
great
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
with
a
good
book
dont
be
in
a
hurry
with
this
one
i
must
have
one
for
the
cellar
nicely
executed
tripel
with
a
great
deal
of
complexity
allagash
is
probably
my
favorite
american
brewer
of
belgian
styles
and
curieux
doesnt
disappoint
the
alcohol
presence
could
have
been
better
concealed
as
this
bottle
has
some
overdone
warming
that
is
almost
hot
at
times
i
would
prefer
their
ordinary
tripel
to
this
one
but
im
looking
forward
to
sampling
a
different
batch
of
curieux
to
compare
with
this

va
ouch
definitely
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
i
am
sampling
this
750
bottle
in
a
snifter
at
room
temp
the
bottle
opens
with
a
loud
pop
almost
expect
a
geyser
but
not
even
a
little
foam
i
pour
the
beer
into
the
snifter
and
it
exhibits
a
clear
golden
orange
hue
with
a
fluffy
bleached
white
head
of
1
cm
resting
on
the
surface
aroma
is
light
but
caramel
and
some
mild
spicy
hops
are
overpowered
with
by
a
sweet
bourbon
presence
first
sip
reveals
a
very
fine
yet
slightly
prickly
carbonation
and
a
slightly
syrupy
body
flavor
is
rich
and
complex
with
a
hint
of
dry
wood
and
some
tangy
yeast
hits
mixing
with
the
strong
bourbon
flavor
the
bourbon
notes
leave
a
sweet
smooth
coating
on
my
palate
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
also
really
like
bourbon
too
if
you
are
looking
for
more
typical
belgian
notes
this
may
not
be
the
beer
for
you
no
hint
of
the

from

acton
ma
bottled
1004
had
this
sitting
in
my
beer
closet
since
november
and
opened
it
up
for
my
friend
when
he
came
over
for
dinner
the
appearance
is
a
finely
carbonated
budweiser
gold
not
the
best
description
but
that
is
what
it
made
me
think
of
a
very
thin
head
formed
in
the
glass
the
bubbles
rise
very
prettily
from
the
stem
of
the
glass
the
nose
reminds
me
of
my
fathers
bourbon
with
very
strong
honey
tones
the
flavor
is
very
a
sweet
meadlike
honey
hints
of
apples
plus
spice
flavors
and
a
subtley
pleasureable
bourbon
finish
on
the
tongue
the
hops
also
help
smooth
out
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
and
just
sticks
to
the
tongue
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
but
nicely
hidden
and
balanced
behind
all
of
the
malts
and
hops
very
drinkable
i
am
definitely
pick
up
another
couple
bottles
of
this
and
set
aside
for
a
special
occasion
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
a
crazy
beer
for
sure
allagashs
beers
are
always
good
but
id
have
to
say
this
is
the
most
unique
of
their
beers
it
really
has
a
flavor
all
to
itself
and
its
wonderful
if
you
find
this
buy
it
poured
a
beautiful
orangish
color
but
the
head
dissipated
a
little
too
quickly
smelled
of
sweet
and
of
bourbon
tastes
like
a
wellmade
tripel
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
until
you
start
to
taste
the
bourbon
that
is
most
prevalent
at
the
end
let
me
take
another
sip
sugars
bourbon
slight
bitterness
pepper
candy
expensive
so
i
doubt
ill
ever
try
it
again
kind
of
a
shame
i
decided
to
drink
it
during
a
rerun
of
the
king
of
queens
light
fleshy
fruit
aroma
up
front
quickly
smothered
by
the
bourbon
alcohol
some
coconut
and
rubbing
alcohol
airy
bright
white
head
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
film
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
colored
beer
with
a
few
stray
bubbles
rising
slowly
to
the
surface
tastes
like
a
bourbon
infused
triple
fleshy
fruit
and
yeasty
triple
flavor
goes
toetotoe
with
the
mild
bourbon
tones
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
i
thiink
id
rather
spend
my
15
on
two
bottles
of
the
triple
initial
soft
covering
of
carbonation
with
some
littering
out
into
striated
jettrails
very
understated
nose
of
sifted
stew
golden
raisins
and
a
bit
of
ginger
pale
yellow
hue
with
just
a
hint
of
haze
but
on
the
whole
fairly
clear
and
opalescent
some
biting
bourbon
of
flashing
heat
and
woody
oak
up
front
followed
by
a
warming
alcohol
suppressant
wonderful
balance
of
all
inputs
great
fallwinter
offering
drinkablility
had
a
bit
of
a
hard
time
finishing
the
glass
not
the
beer
for
me
but
many
others
like
it
it
is
a
good
beer
just
not
at
all
what
i
am
into
drinkability
is
really
very
good
must
admit
when
i
first
heard
about
this
beer
i
was
highly
skeptical
im
a
fool
for
doubting
the
genius
of
mr
tod
this
beer
is
a
true
classic
and
a
style
buster
only
a
mad
brewing
genius
like
him
could
marry
barrel
aging
and
a
worldclass
triple
to
make
such
an
intriguing
and
tasty
treat
allagash
has
a
lot
of
good
beers
and
this
one
fits
near
or
maybe
at
the
top
for
an
11
alcohol
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
it
is
some
and
really
tasty
like
the
grand
cru
but
you
get
a
hint
of
burbon
from
the
oak
aged
barrels
it
is
the
smoothest
11
abv
beer
i
have
ever
drank
it
is
a
little
price
at
1012
per
bottle
but
it
is
very
good
i
have
only
been
in
maine
for
a
couple
of
months
but
allagash
has
nothing
but
good
brews
thanks
to
sheepnutz
for
sharing
this
bottle
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
corked
25
4oz
bottle
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
the
aroma
has
a
lot
going
on
with
the
vanilla
spices
yeast
oak
and
orange
very
nice
the
flavor
was
nice
lots
of
spices
and
peppery
notes
from
the
belgian
yeasts
and
some
vanilla
and
honey
the
flavor
was
a
bit
hot
as
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
upfront
i
think
a
year
will
do
this
one
wonders
hazy
apricot
appearance
nice
soft
yellow
head
that
laces
very
impressively
tart
almost
lime
aroma
very
fresh
in
impression
with
hints
of
underlying
sweetness
medium
mouthfeel
carbonation
like
a
misty
rain
with
finetextured
bubbles
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
seems
to
mellow
the
tart
crispness
of
the
style
very
nicely
a
woody
and
smooth
impression
sets
in
slight
spices
at
the
close
but
not
heavy
in
that
context
alcohol
is
wellhidden
finishes
with
a
light
orangey
uptake
reminding
you
of
its
tripel
heritage
i
was
pouring
this
beer
at
the
fest
and
wordofmouth
and
appreciation
led
to
a
huge
run
on
it
at
both
sessions
of
the
ebf
it
was
gone
after
only
two
hours
at
both
sessions
nice
beer
in
a
style
i
tend
to
not
appreciate
as
much
ive
been
very
impressed
with
allagash
lately
this
was
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
made
a
mental
note
of
must
try
this
at
the
extreme
beer
fest
in
boston
this
past
weekend
well
there
were
a
lot
of
amazing
beers
there
and
i
got
sidetracked
so
i
picked
up
a
bottle
on
the
way
back
popped
it
open
tonight
and
was
very
pleased
its
more
straight
forward
than
their
original
tripel
which
was
surprising
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
substantial
head
smells
sweet
and
reminiscent
of
vanilla
and
that
signature
barrelaged
warming
scent
that
seems
to
be
in
the
spotlight
right
now
taste
is
full
of
belgian
spices
and
sweet
mature
malts
and
herbal
hop
characters
tints
of
banana
and
vanilla
are
very
present
as
well
never
smelledtasted
banana
in
a
beer
before
wowie
super
smooth
aged
texture
overall
i
cant
tell
if
its
better
than
their
original
tripel
its
a
totally
different
beast
id
say
try
it
for
yourself
its
worth
it
backwash
what
have
they
done
with
my
beloved
tripel
reserve
at
least
they
had
the
good
sense
not
to
name
this
heresy
which
is
what
it
is
ive
been
pretty
disappointed
with
most
of
the
bourbonbarrel
aged
beers
ive
had
lately
e
g
heresy
frankly
tripel
is
one
of
the
last
styles
id
expect
to
show
well
after
being
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
its
a
delicate
if
highabv
beer
with
a
balance
of
sweet
and
complex
flavors
the
bourbon
simply
overwhelms
it
if
allagash
wishes
to
experiment
with
different
expressions
i
think
aging
in
port
sherry
or
rum
casks
might
work
much
better
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
die
down
fairly
quickly
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
good
oak
scent
with
lots
of
spices
and
a
hint
of
citrus
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
also
spicy
with
lots
of
pepper
some
lemon
and
a
bunch
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
strong
the
drinkability
is
just
decent
for
a
9
5
beer
due
to
the
high
dose
of
alcohol
flavor
on
the
finish
a
nice
barrelaged
beer
be
sure
to
read
the
alstrom
brothers
article
on
this
one
to
learn
more
thanks
to
sheepnutz
for
sharing
this
bottle
with
us
it
poured
a
hazy
oranged
yellow
color
with
a
coat
of
head
over
top
the
nose
was
really
busy
with
oak
alcohol
sweetness
honey
caramel
lots
more
as
well
and
citrusy
lemon
and
orange
tones
the
flavor
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
the
alcohole
really
kicked
me
in
the
face
upfront
some
peppery
and
sweet
notes
followed
but
the
alcohol
was
way
too
big
in
the
flavor
for
me
to
enjoy
the
feel
was
moderate
slightly
reamy
and
smooth
i
think
this
beer
needs
to
sit
down
for
a
while
and
mellow
the
alcohol
just
really
turned
me
off
from
it
it
didnt
really
play
well
with
the
other
flavors
in
there
simply
amazing

within
the
realm

the

fairly

not
as
carbonated
as
most
tripels
finishes
dry
at

a
bottle
no
thank
you
the
taste
is
initially
soft
and
creamy
up
front
but
then
moves
to
a
spicy
tripel
dominated
mid
section
which
then
moves
to
a
hint
of
oak
in
the
finish
the
bourbon
character
is
here
but
it
is
not
as
strong
as
the
nose
suggests
and
i
consider
this
a
good
thing
in
the
flavor
the
bourbon
barrel
is
more
an
accompaniment
than
the
only
noticeable
thing
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
the
notes
of
the
tripel
are
strongly
here
but
there
is
an
undercurrent
of
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
i
will
admit
that
i
enjoy
the
regular
tripel
a
wee
bit
more
than
this
concoction
though
i
am
certainly
enjoying
this
beer

cant

so
very

first
the
palate
seems
pretty
smooth
with
that
mild
tartness
but
it
heats
up
through
those
lovely
hayfield
and
straw
flavors
the
bourbon
is
the
dominant
flavor
and
absolute
focus
here
and
its
not
in
the
same
league
than
the
tripel
it
has
qualities
though
i
was
curious
got
it
to
get
into
that
smokiness
hops
presence
is
just
perfectly

this

the
most

brews
at
the
anam

belgian
beer
fest
preparty
it
was
quite
the
party
favorite
a
stunningly
complex
little
brew
worthy
of
note
and
more
than
worth
trying
for
the
sake
of
pondering
it
alone
but
its
intense
and
not
something
id
consider
drinkable
a
dead
ringer
for
a
belgian
tripel
electric
gold
in
color
with
minimal
head
however
the
lace
is
elegant
and
very
pretty
aromas
are
again
very
belgianearthy
funky
rustic
and
true
to
the
style

the
oak
is
never
overdone
and
shows
nice
integration
in

the
brew
screams

a
thunk
it
the
flavor
profile
is

with
sweet

nutty
oaky
notes
in
fine

the
oak
lingers
on
the
long
finish
very
well

a
treat
to

not
your
typical
tripel
track
some
of
this
stuff
down
if
you
can
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
perfect
it
boasts
of
pale
malts
corriander
orange
peels
and
a
strong
bourbon
odor
the
taste
is
very
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
base
but
the
flavor
is
all
bourbon
it
feels
like
drinking
a
weak
whiskey
but
very
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
brew
for
sure
ive
never
tasted
anything
like
this
i
dont
know
if
this
is
going
to
be
a
regular
offering
but
i
hope
so
not
gonna
have
a
problem
drinking
a
couple
of
these
thanks
to
abc
for
bringing
such
a
prize
notes
how
could
a
random
experiment
succeed
as
much
as
this
beer
does
one
of
the
best
and
most
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
and
one
that
i
hope
to
god
makes
it
to
bottle
or
at
least
to
regular
keggings
awesome
stuff
this
is
a
phenomenal
tripel
it
is
really
well
constructed
and
balanced
with
a
nice
dry
finish
more
please
o
a
very
nice
tripel
hops
seem
to
be
providing
a
unique
character
to
it

sweet
nice
and
plush
modest

overallhad
high
expectations
for
this
beer
as
a
belgian
style
brew
from
boulevard
and
wasnt
disappointed
excellent
beer
o
another
very
good
beer
from
boulevard
not
spectacular
but
certainly
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
4
cheers
best
tripped
ive
had
this
far
golden
with
huge
white
head
and
good
lacing
bubblegum
and
white
pepper
most
prevalent
in
the
aroma
peppery
alcohol
and
honey
smoothness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
with
hints
of
apricot
pear
and
a
bit
more
gum
good
stuff
what
a
cheese
ball
name
and
i
love
the
grateful
dead
so
i
had
to
try
this
latest
punnery
oh
my
god
what
have
i
in
my
paws
but
the
most
delicious
tripel
i
have
ever
tasted
the
alcohol
so
well
hidden
and
such
a
complex
flavor
a
unique
color
this
this
trip
was
better
than
the
one
at
the
alpine
valley
shows
where
myself
and
these
three
girls
ended
up
in
my
tent
and
went
to
sleep
great
shows
though
and
great
beer
this
beer
does
nothing
for
me
first
it
is
too
strong
and
difficult
to
drink
it
tastes
like
grapefruit
juice
water
i
dont
see
how
this
is
rated
so
high
just
my
opinion
o
this
is
an
outstanding
tripel
the
flavors
are
very
balanced
and
make
this
an
enjoyable
experience
t
balance
is
spot
on
not
too
sweet
or
heavyhanded
with
the
belgian
candi
sugars
like
some
other
beers
ive
had
excellent
peppery
lemon
and
woody
hop
presence
keeps
the
banana
in
check
slight
sulfur
and
good
pear
flavor
tastes
great
wish
my
favorite
store
still
had
some
o
very
good
tripel
makes
me
wish
id
bought
the
22
0z
bomber
a
well
executed
tripel
complex
and
true
the
its
trappist
counterparts
if
i
had
to
choose
a
beer
to
sit
back
and
relax
on
the
beach
with
this
would
be
it
o
a
very
nice
american
representation
of
the
style
very
enjoyable
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
though
there
is
a
light
amount
of
alcohol
present
as
the
beers
warms
up
light
color
lots
of
foam
dry
typical
boulevard
taste
should
have
checked
the
date
on
the
bottle
before
i
bought
it
will
try
a
fresher
one
next
time
in
the
end
there
was
a
little
wet
cardboard
stale
taste
to
this
pour
which
i
am
willing
to
write
off
as
age
will
update
my
thoughts
on
a
rereview
overall
this
is
a
classic
beer
here
from
boulevard
solid
flavor
yet
unique
and
keeps
the
drinker
interested
i
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
this
bottle
was
aged
a
bit
but
very
nice
wonderful
belgian
yeasty
weird
purple
grape
taste
in
there
dunno
what
that
is
but
it
just
tastes
great
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
belgian
i
like
it
better
then
chimay
and
its
less
money
when
you
can
find
4
packs
very
good
beer
worthy
of
repeating
o
this
is
a
well
made
easy
to
drink
beer
a
lot
of
character
and
complexity
with
this
beer
a
standard
pour
yields
a
voluminous
rich
whipped
froth
with
a
waffled
top
comprised
of
big
airy
chunky
bubbles
rock
star
retention
the
color
is
a
very
pale
muted
amber
there
is
a
slight
haziness
throughout
a
cyclone
of
micro
bubbled
quick
carbonation
in
the
center
of
the
glass
with
a
few
stray
bubbles
elsewhere
a
subdued
belgian
yeast
presence
some
overly
ripened
light
colored
fruits
golden
raisins
there
is
a
mix
of
floral
and
grassy
notes
mixed
in
as
well
just
a
light
touch
of
honey
as
well
good
depth
and
complexity
the
palate
is
an
exact
reproduction
of
the
aroma
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
prickly
carbonation
sleek
with
a
touch
of
dryness
throughout
that
intensifies
on
the
finish
slightly
sticky
a
rock
solid
tripel
the
apperance
is
the
rock
star
here
with
all
other
facets
being
solidly
above
average
good
stuff
im
becoming
a
bigger
fan
of
boulevard
with
each
and
every
passing
brew
i
try
an
excellent
fruity
flavorful
yet
dry
tripel
mouthfeel
well
attenuated
and
well
carbonated
overall
full
disclosure
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
in
the
world
i
tried
it
for
the
first
time
two
years
ago
when
i
was
visiting
a
friend
in
utah
and
it
has
haunted
me
since
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
its
company
only
twice
since
we
first
met
if
anyone
knows
where
to
find
it
in
nyc
please
let
me
know
if
you
see
it
at
a
store
take
it
home
with
you
you
wont
regret
it
overall
this
is
quite
a
good
brew
unfortunately
i
read
in
a
few
other
reviews
that
this
beer
tastes
kinda
soapy
and
now
i
can
not
shake
this
thought
from
my
head
every
time
i
take
a
sip
when
i
first
tried
this
i
would
have
rated
it
higher
but
it
really
is
kind
of
soapy
what
can
i
say
its
no
fin
du
monde
but
it
is
a
welcome
change
of
pace
a
very
well
done
tasty
tripel
overall
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
tastes
like
it
came
from
belgium
but
was
made
in
kansas
city
mo
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
its
reasonably
priced
at
8
99
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
glass
golden
color
with
a
luscious
thick
head
nose
has
notes
of
light
stone
fruit
and
white
pepper
tastes
great
triple
is
a
style
that
is
growing
on
me
perhaps
too
drinkable
lemony
flavors
abound
with
a
nice
kick
of
both
alcohol
and
spiciness
pour
is
slightly
hazed
golden
yellow
with
a
tight
white
head
nose
has
a
fair
bit
of
tangy
yeast
and
peppery
spice
up
front
a
bit
of
soapy
hop
and
some
lemon
notes
taste
is
a
bit
more
soapy
yeast
isnt
quite
as
pronounced
lemon
is
moderate
not
sweet
but
the
balance
is
a
bit
soapy
body
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
the
strong
carb
helps
to
balance
it
high
alcohol
content
that
does
not
take
too
much
away
from
the
flavor
bready
and
banana
ar
e
the
high
points
of
the
taste
head
is
good
and
flavor
is
surprisingly
balanced
hops
are
balanced
and
go
well
with
the
banana
yeasty
flavor
great
overall
balanced
brew
and
a
must
have
for
the
true
beer
lover
great
trippel
pours
from
the
bottle
a
light
gold
with
only
a
touch
of
haze
from
the
rising
bubbles
the
white
head
starts
big
but
leaves
quickly
a
fine
aroma
of
bananas
yeast
and
spice
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
lots
of
banana
apples
yeast
and
a
nice
sweetness
the
carbonation
gives
the
mouth
a
light
crispness
simply
an
excellent
tripel
that
tastes
like
it
came
straight
from
belgium
the
beer
itself
pours
a
smooth
small
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
but
still
collects
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
beer
itself
is
a
hazy
gold
with
a
bit
of
orange
notes
the
smell
has
strong
banana
yeast
notes
with
strong
hints
of
bready
malt
notes
the
beer
also
a
slightly
sour
hop
note
that
seems
dulled
by
the
other
notes
the
beer
itself
is
fairly
bananas
the
banana
notes
are
just
as
strong
in
the
taste
as
it
is
in
the
smell
but
the
hop
sourness
adds
a
bit
of
balance
to
the
yeast
and
candi
sugar
notes
the
malts
have
a
stronger
bread
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
medium
bodied
with
biting
carbonation
but
on
the
lighter
side
the
beer
also
has
a
very
smooth
feeling
despite
the
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
tripel
and
most
certainly
one
of
the
greats
im
shocked
that
a
brewery
in
mississippi
can
produce
something
so
akin
to
the
products
of
the
monks
of
trappist
abbeys
in
belgium
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
long
strange
tripel
or
chimay
white
id
have
to
choose
both
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
if
there
were
just
ounces
more
of
hops
per
barrell
i
might
rank
this
a
pure
5
00
thats
pure
subjectivity
howeverthe
beer
is
still
worldclass
altogether
very
nice
an
excellent
and
enjoyable
brew
outstanding
cheers
just
a
fantastic
tripel
it
may
be
the
best
ive
ever
had
so
good
this
is
really
good
a
better
tripel
than
some
belgians
make
overall
its
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
beer
o
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
balanced
tripel
i
like
sweeter
beers
and
have
had
tripels
which
are
much
more
honeyed
or
sugary
but
this
beer
argues
the
virtue
of
its
approach
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
overall
happy
to
have
enjoyed
this
offering
however
i
enjoy
a
handful
of
other
tripels
more
overall
a
good
american
tripel
much
more
alcohol
prone
than
most
but
not
in
a
bad
way
lots
of
good
flavors
and
worth
a
try
this
one
is
past
its
best
by
date
but
i
wouldnt
worry
about
that
with
this
big
tripel
that
should
continue
to
taste
good
for
years
to
come
golden
yellow
with
an
slight
orange
tint
one
finger
head
when
poured
which
persisted
to
some
extent
the
entire
time
i
was
drinking
the
beer
sweet
aroma
with
the
presence
of
alcohol
noted
very
nice
tripel
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
sweet
slightly
fruity
with
a
dry
finish
lots
of
small
carbonation
medium
body
there
is
some
substance
to
the
beer
not
thin
or
watery
overall
a
great
tripel
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
this
american
triple
beats
many
belgium
that
i
have
had
hands
down
with
that
said
90
of
my
beer
intact
is
a
form
of
belgium
style
this
is
an
outstanding
tripel
not
to
be
missed

this
is
my
goto
pizza
beer
it
tastes
incredible
with
pizza
o
a
beautiful
tripel
above
average
for
an
american
offering
slightly
above
center
mass
for
an
authentic
belgian
this
beer
is
all
about
the
complementary
aromas
and
flavors
the
main
is
just
there
to
carry
the
good
stuff
to
you
for
your
enjoyment
while
the
aroma
is
not
powerful
the
flavors
do
follow
and
jump
it
up
a
bit
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
good
fit
to
the
smokestack
series
overall
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic
the
most
memorable
tripel
i
have
had
in
quite
a
long
time
a
really
well
made
tripel
that
stood
up
very
well
against
la
fin
du
monde
pairs
well
with
aged
sharp
cheddar
cheese
overall
an
excellent
tripel
but
lacking
some
of
the
pepperymore
spicy
flavors
i
enjoy
with
other
tripels
wow
this
one
is
top
shelf
tripel
boulevard
dont
play
poured
a
orangish
body
with
massive
two
finger
head
that
dies
slow
and
leaves
lace
a
spicy
and
fruity
aroma
mostly
although
yeast
and
orange
are
there
as
typical
with
a
belgian
style
beer
but
more
along
some
floral
spices
and
sweet
fruits
or
close
to
it
could
be
anything
although
i
want
to
say
sweet
apples
that
i
like
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
has
a
spicy
edge
that
i
found
leading
to
a
crisp
finish
for
the
most
part
i
get
sweet
tropical
fruits
apricot
mango
something
in
that
range
and
some
sugary
malts
in
the
beer
as
this
triple
seems
to
be
more
sweet
than
most
of
this
style
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
guess
when
i
order
a
triple
i
expect
something
closer
to
style
and
not
so
sweet
as
the
sweetness
became
overbearing
at
times
overall
a
good
solid
tripel
that
has
suggestions
of
being
really
good
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
will
be
buying
this
again
o
boulevard
threw
in
some
twists
to
this
tipel
to
take
the
traditional
style
and
throw
in
some
wow
factor
the
taste
and
nose
are
very
prevalent
just
like
i
enjoy
a
must
buy
if
looking
for
a
tripel
o
a
wonderfully
constructed
tripel
full
of
subtleties
and
nuances
that
make
for
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
pretty
awesome
beer
tasty
clean
has
classic
trippel
flavors
but
comes
across
as
not
mild
but
balanced
restrained
controlled
a
nice
sipper
for
a
long
strange
evening
will
pour
a
five

fades
slowly

no

this

in

a

weird
unique
for
sure
but
the

dont
work

as

as
some
of
the

certainly
good
enough
for
a

chance
o
great
beer
something
different
not
my
favorite
style
but
lots
of
flavor
in
this
beer
would
only
take
one
or
two
will
pick
up
from
time
to
time
for
sure
the
feel
is
not
as
carbonated
as
one
may
expect
with
the
rush
of
bubbling
in
appearance
light
refreshing
but
not
thin
at
all
this
hides
the
strong
abv
very
well
if
you
didnt
look
at
the
bottle
you
would
never
guess
it
was
an
american
belgian
boulevard
nailed
it
a
very
enjoyable
brew
this
beer
was
certainly
one
i
plan
to
have
again
a
very
nice
example
of
a
tripel
overall
loved
it
and
i
think
the
extra
and
accidental
bottle
conditioning
didnt
hurt
d
i
am
no
purist
and
am
far
from
an
expert
on
this
style
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
relatively
tasty
brew
and
very
drinkable
not
a
big
fan
of
heavily
phenolic
brews
and
this
one
suits
me
just
right
would
definitely
have
again
overall
there
is
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
this
beer
and
a
lot
of
good
things
going
on
with
it
it
is
almost
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
with
a
hoppy
finish
i
really
like
it
and
will
get
my
hands
on
some
more
and
try
later
overall
a
very
nice
looking
beer
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
carbonation
was
spot
on
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
due
to
the
spicyness
and
sweetness
its
like
it
doesnt
want
you
to
know
overall
a
great
example
of
an
american
take
on
a
belgian
style
taste
mimics
the
nose
to
some
extent
bright
rich
and
juicy
with
guava
lemon
grapefruit
green
raisins
and
honey
all
enshrouded
in
yeasty
funk
seems
juicier
tasting
than
a
traditional
tripel
but
theres
a
buttery
richness
in
the
middle
that
speaks
to
its
heritage
starts
out
really
bright
and
dangerously
drinkable
but
as
it
warms
and
mellows
becomes
sort
of
buttery
warm
and
boozy
very
nice
unique
refreshing
quaff
wow
i
found
this
in
my
supermarket
which
will
remain
nameless
for
10
a
four
pack
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
and
then
i
find
that
the
bros
gave
it
100pts
their
description
is
perfect
i
wish
i
hadnt
read
it
before
i
wrote
my
review
because
now
i
dont
know
what
else
to
add
the
smell
is
divine
with
fruit
and
malt
and
everything
as
it
should
be
it
poured
just
like
a
good
beer
should
with
plenty
of
sticky
head
backed
by
a
subtle
and
subdued
carbonation
factor
that
was
pleasant
in
the
mouth
and
the
nose
all
of
the
tripel
flavors
are
there
and
in
full
force
what
is
wrong
with
this
beer
nothing
i
love
the
effort
i
love
the
concept
i
love
the
homage
and
i
wish
i
has
been
born
trip
houge
and
been
able
to
live
up
to
this
gift
i
hope
that
my
life
can
one
day
be
summed
up
in
an
offering
such
as
this
reach
out
your
hand
if
your
cup
be
empty
hopefully
some
king
head
will
fill
it
with
this
very
flavorful
fairly
hoppy
tripel
that
matches
if
not
exceeds
my
expectations
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
boulevard
and
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
at
all
it
hides
the
big
alcohol
very
well
and
manages
to
even
be
a
pretty
easy
drinker
not
overly
sweet
just
a
little
light
in
body
yet
thats
not
a
problem
at
all
subtle
hint
of
spiciness
which
goes
well
with
the
fruity
flavors
a
very
solid
tripel
that
i
will
drink
again
if
not
more
than
once
overall
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
packed
with
flavors
rich
texture
and
i
would
say
dangerously
drinkable
given
the
9
abv
that
sneaks
up
on
you
o
i
do
not
like
belgian
tripels
too
much
but
i
would
buy
this
again
boulevard
is
a
class
act
imo
o
one
of
the
better
trippels
that
i
have
had
to
drink
refreshing
and
full
of
flavor
try
it
if
you
see
it
thank
you
matt
for
the
bottle
overall
4
55
long
strange
tripel
is
probably
the
best
american
take
on
the
belgian
tripel
style
ive
had
to
date
its
fairly
traditional
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
its
fruity
yeasty
generously
carbonated
anddespite
the
high
alcoholquite
easy
to
drink
awesome
flavor
and
exceptional
feel
get
it
when
you
can
in
four
packs
high
b
long
strange
tripel
pours
a
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
sweet
yeasty
aroma
with
strong
notes
of
belgian
candies
taste
is
much
of
the
same
very
strong
yeast
and
strong
belgian
candy
flavor
with
a
finish
that
is
of
banana
like
esters
full
flavors
full
body
but
just
too
sweet
overall
a
flavorful
tripel
that
is
differently
good
but
on
the
sweeter
side
o
one
of
the
best
american
tripels
ive
had
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
nicely
complex
without
being
overwhelming
great
value
as
well
get
some
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
i
am
becoming
a
big
fan
of

sure
wish

fierce
amount

not

to
be

very
fine

off
with
a
peppery

before

the

in

pretzels
with
a
white
vinegar
edge
in
the
mouth
its
fullbodied
and
thick
the
carbonation
creates
a
rich
creaminess
rather
than
refreshing
briskness
here
the
sour
orange
to
white
grapefruit
citrus
leads
the
pack
leading
into
salt
and
pepper
clove
chamomile
and
bitter
grasses
the
latter
welcome
as
a
foil
to
the
at
times
dried
fruit
sweetness
in
the
apricot
apple
peach
pear
pineapple
fruit
fairly
tropical
on
the
clean
side
and
not
blatantly
yeasty
its
sourness
keeps
the
palate
tightening
the
banana
and
bubblegum
make
a
minor
appearance
at
the
end
retronasally
and
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
great
drinkability
no
overt
sense
of
its
higher
abv
t
caramel
and
slightly
bready
malt
upfront
with
a
nice
kick
of
spicy
yeast
in
the
middle
citrus
peel
mainly
orange
coriander
hints
of
earthy
hops
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
very
smooth
a
nice
tripel
overall
this
was
good
and
a
fine
american
version
of
the
style
but
it
lacked
something
and
let
me
down
just
a
little
bit
it
was
good
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
wish
there
was
perhaps
more
hops
adding
some
different
aspect
of
the
flavor
profile
and
attack
hopefully
this
beer
was
consumed
as
intended
i
ordered
it
online
from
letspours
and
the
bottle
listed
batch
t12230
with
a
best
by
date
of
052013
i
ordered
this
in
midjune
2013
so
that
was
disappointing
to
read
after
it
arrived
overall
a
good
beer
but
did
i
miss
its
peak
flavor
onot
normally
a
huge
fan
of
triples
but
this
is
excellent
id
definately
recommend
this
even
if
tripel
isnt
your
favourite
style
o
an
enjoyable
wellbalanced
tripel
ill
gladly
have
it
again
this
is
a
solid
american
tripel
golden
and
beautiful
this
is
a
great
beer
to
look
at
the
nose
is
a
little
less
inviting
not
in
an
unpleasant
way
but
rather
behaving
like
a
parent
who
is
too
busy
to
show
up
for
their
kids
soccer
match
the
hops
shine
through
here
more
than
most
tripels
and
its
easier
to
drink
than
its
9
25
abv
would
suggest
crisp
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
lighter
and
easier
than
say
allagash
triple
or
chimay
cinq
cents
but
a
little
less
complex
than
something
like
tripel
karmeliet
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
enjoy
tripels
or
belgian
goldens
o
boulevards
smokestack
series
is
among
my
favorite
lineup
of
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
this
one
is
up
there
when
it
comes
to
tripels
and
its
everything
you
want
in
the
style
refreshing
drinkable
complex
beer
overall
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
9
beers
i
have
had
this
is
also
a
fantastically
balanced
superb
tripel
boulevard
really
knows
how
to
make
some
killer
belgianstyle
beers
o
this
is
a
really
good
represention
of
the
style
and
has
some
nice
complexities
in
the
smell
and
taste
some
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
it
doesnt
really
detract
too
much
from
the
drinkability
overall
a
fantastic
domestic
tripel
among
the
best
that
ive
had
in
fact
should
be
relatively
easy
to
obtain
and
you
should
definitely
give
it
a
try
this
has
been
a
go
to
for
me
for
a
while
now
and
i
still
get
it
regularly
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
golden
amber
with
a
healthy
three
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
chunky
lacing
classic
tripel
aroma
of
bready
malt
apple
and
pear
juice
cardamom
belgian
yeast
peppery
flavor
follows
with
initial
apple
and
pear
juice
bread
malt
finishing
drier
with
well
developed
cardamom
and
clove
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
from
carbonation
a
very
nicely
made
domestic
tripel
a
bit
astringent
on
early
drinking
but
developing
more
flavor
and
a
balanced
finish
as
the
glass
is
emptied
well
done
d
great
complex
and
balance
tripel
very
smooth
o
stellar
i
dont
much
care
for
boulevards
everyday
shelf
offerings
but
the
smokestack
series
is
truly
a
remarkable
step
up
for
2
50
a
bottle
this
is
a
winner
through
and
through
and
would
have
no
problem
standing
toe
to
toe
with
other
world
class
brews
in
the
same
style
pours
an
attractive
light
golden
amber
a
very
careful
pour
is
required
as
the
cotton
white
head
grows
quickly
and
sinks
slowly
delivering
tons
of
lacing
smells
of
bready
malts
honey
pear
fuji
apple
the
sweetness
is
cut
by
the
high
carbonation
and
there
is
a
slight
sourness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
hints
of
tree
fruit
and
grain
despite
its
growing
size
and
popularity
forcing
a
shift
to
larger
and
larger
batch
sizes
boulevard
continues
to
impress
and
delight
o
tasty
with
some
good
complexity
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
sipping
for
a
while
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
mediumhigh
levels
of
carbonation
resulting
in
a
slightly
fizzy
mouthfeel
that
takes
a
bit
of
time
to
reach
a
foamy
smooth
state
on
the
palate
perhaps
my
only
gripe
with
the
beer
albeit
minor
is
this
slight
fizziness
closes
quite
dry
satisfying
with
moderate
stickiness
left
across
the
palate
a
truly
exceptional
tripel
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
such
a
beautiful
beer
with
complex
aromas
and
flavors
that
is
well
balanced
overall
very
delicious
though
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
tripels
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
get
this
again
flavors
of
sweet
malts
honey
straw
hops
with
a
slight
tingling
from
the
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
white
pepper
and
pink
grapefruit
rind
overall
a
darn
tasty
tripel
in
my
book
smooth
yet
full
bodied
inviting
yet
complex
a
well
done
tripel
still
have
enjoyed
most
of
the
offerings
from
this
brewery
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
boulevard
smokestack
series
along
with
sixth
glass
and
ryeonrye
this
absolutely
one
to
try
and
is
highly
recommended
imo
overall
a
really
good
take
on
the
belgian
tripel
style
nice
balance
of
spices
and
fruit
esters
very
zesty
overy
good
tripel
and
a
decent
price
point
for
this
quality
so
listen
to
some
dead
when
you
drink
this
beverage
i
mean
what
else
pairs
with
this
years
ago
i
went
to
a
great
dead
concert
that
you
missed
garcia
would
play
long
great
guitar
solos
just
out
in
space
go
hear
1969s
livedead
workingmans
dead
american
beauty
or
my
fave
anthem
of
the
sun
overall
a
very
nice
beer
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
in
a
while
well
done
boulevard
o
balanced
unique
delicious
worth
a
try
great
job
by
an
american
midwest
brewery
enjoyed
this
one
in
kansas
city
overall
pretty
solid
tripel
more
please
im
a
few
beers
deep
into
boulevards
belgian
styled
offerings
and
i
am
impressed
very
solid
stuff
overall
very
good
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
work
very
nicely
together
and
its
got
a
lot
going
on
at
a
subtle
level
without
needing
any
one
overbearing
taste
very
drinkable
and
the
9
isnt
really
noticeable
which
is
probably
very
dangerous
recommended
overall
i
enjoy
trying
belgian
style
ales
this
is
an
ok
one
but
not
one
id
hunt
down
again
poured
into
an
over
sized
wine
glass
a
cloudy
yellowishorange
look
nicely
complimented
by
a
thick
foamy
head
with
a
lot
of
staying
power
citrus
and
spice
smell
dominates
with
a
sweet
malty
aroma
underneath
dry
tangy
fruit
on
the
front
malty
sweetness
in
the
middle
just
like
the
aroma
and
warm
alcohol
at
the
end
very
nice
smooth
and
velvety
mouth
feel
an
outstanding
and
wellbalance
tripel
a
must
try
o
happy
to
find
another
domestic
brewer
producing
belgian
beers
a
very
good
tripel
that
i
would
try
again
especially
at
this
price
range
pours
a
mostly
clear
deep
golden
color
under
a
fittingly
large
rocky
head
of
thick
luscious
foam
aromas
of
softly
sweet
malt
light
dough
spices
herbs
and
dried
fruit
malt
is
toned
down
in
the
flavor
though
theres
a
nice
cakey
element
increased
phenolics
peppery
spice
through
the
middle
with
apple
apricot
and
slight
citrus
juice
creamy
fluffy
mouthfeel
appropriately
carbonated
drying
and
not
too
sweet
never
boozy
well
done
pours
a
sparkling
applejuiceyellow
color
with
a
massive
foamy
eggshellwhite
head
the
aroma
is
an
expected
combination
of
light
tart
applelike
yeastiness
against
dry
grassy
hops
the
flavor
has
a
light
bready
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
banana
but
it
is
mostly
a
very
dry
grassy
almost
dirtlike
bitterness
that
lingers
in
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
the
light
very
active
carbonation
plays
off
this
flavor
profile
leaving
an
exceptionally
drying
sensation
in
the
finish
overall
i
will
readily
admit
that
tripels
arent
a
preferred
style
for
me
but
i
have
been
able
to
enjoy
some
in
the
past
just
not
this
one
overall
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
only
one
i
put
above
it
that
i
have
tried
is
la
fin
du
monde
which
full
disclosure
is
my
favorite
beer
i
can
get
locally
served
into
boulevard
glass
appearance
is
bright
gold
with
striking
clarity
and
cascading
bubbles
frothy
white
head
is
formed
and
retains
very
nicely
and
leaves
heavy
lacing
nose
features
floral
notes
with
heavy
spice
and
clove
character
bready
belgian
yeast
looms
large
with
accents
of
lemon
zest
taste
is
straight
forward
and
clean
for
a
tripel
plenty
of
belgo
character
which
provides
some
sweetness
fruity
esters
light
banana
moderate
clove
and
minimal
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
with
a
medium
weight
mouthfeel
overall
a
refreshing
clean
and
full
flavored
tripel
overall
pretty
good
tripel
as
far
as
im
concerned
for
a
9
beer
it
certainly
does
not
drink
like
a
9
beer
very
unique
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
yellow
with
a
big
beautiful
head
on
top
that
stays
for
awhile
and
is
full
of
sudsy
bubbles
that
sit
at
top
as
creamy
smoothness
the
beers
body
is
hazy
lightly
translucent
and
peppered
with
a
thick
torrent
of
carbonation
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
the
beers
lacing
is
fat
and
walllike
with
rather
large
bubbles
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
like
snow
on
the
ground
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
quite
hefeweizenlike
with
thick
clove
and
banana
scents
alongside
sweet
lemon
bread
notes
that
reveal
the
belgian
yeast
in
the
beer
the
fruity
esters
on
the
beer
are
bright
and
lively
on
the
nostrils
also
hinting
towards
pineapple
and
some
lighter
tropical
fruit
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
surprisingly
bitter
but
also
strongly
of
banana
bread
the
taste
begins
as
bitter
and
lightly
medicinal
hops
which
slowly
open
into
lovely
banana
bread
flavors
with
splashes
of
lemon
and
pineapple
though
the
medicinal
bitter
remains
as
an
undercurrent
on
the
taste
buds
the
finish
is
strong
with
banana
bread
but
the
aftertaste
returns
to
the
surprising
amount
of
hops
hiding
in
this
beer
and
rings
with
grassy
medicinal
bitters
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
fierce
with
carbonation
the
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
leaves
a
sticky
ichor
briefly
on
the
tongue
as
it
travels
down
the
throat
the
mouth
is
left
a
little
burned
from
the
carbonation
and
quite
dry
from
the
hops
though
the
tongue
does
retain
some
small
reserves
of
saliva
overall
this
beer
is
surprisingly
bitter
and
harsh
on
the
mouth
but
has
an
awesome
smell
and
some
awesome
flavors
i
think
a
little
gentler
of
a
hand
when
hopping
this
beer
could
be
used
but
it
is
an
american
tripel
after
all
and
what
are
we
americans
known
for
if
not
our
overdosing
of
hops
this
is
another
success
from
boulevard
try
this
beer
this
is
a
nice
tripel
the
traditional
flavors
are
evident
and
the
strong
abv
is
noticeable
but
tucked
away
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
with
a
traditional
flavor
profile
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
belgian
beer
pours
cloudy
gold
with
a
dense
soapy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
nice
cap
leaving
behind
lots
of
sticky
lacing
big
tripel
aromas
of
bubblegum
light
clove
orange
peeland
wheat
very
crisp
and
clean
taste
is
similarly
clean
very
balanced
with
light
wheat
malt
banana
bubblegum
and
mildly
spicy
clove
phenols
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
really
excellent
tripel
one
of
my
favorites
of
recent
memory
the
sample
i
got
popped
and
fizzed
like
new
years
champagne
so
if
you
get
this
in
a
bottle
open
with
care
and
have
a
towel
handy
it
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
clear
bright
solar
yellow
with
a
thick
fluffy
snowwhite
head
that
leaves
very
generous
lacing
strong
yeasty
aroma
has
apple
and
pear
notes
and
a
hint
of
malt
fruity
yeasty
flavor
fills
the
mouth
with
apple
pear
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
as
well
as
a
whisper
of
hoppy
bitterness
lively
texture
has
good
body
and
fizz
leaving
a
fruity
tingly
slightly
yeasty
and
malty
finish
keep
your
eyes
peeled
for
this
one
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
massive
head
aroma
of
banana
citrus
and
funky
yeast
slight
bit
of
spice
on
the
nose
nice
sweet
banana
orange
flavor
follows
a
bit
of
sweet
honey
and
some
dryness
to
boot
smooth
with
light
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
a
bit
of
bite
on
the
way
down
solid
tripel
from
a
brewery
that
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
though
limited
experience
with
them
verdict
a
well
made
american
tripel
from
boulevard
and
i
think
that
this
can
be
considered
another
success
of
the
series
it
may
not
be
their
strongest
belgian
style
offering
i
still
prefer
the
sixth
glass
and
saisonbrett
but
this
is
definitely
a
worthy
beer
for
anyone
who
enjoys
this
style
o
definitely
a
solid
tripel
all
around
and
was
glad
to
try
another
boulevard
offering
o
excellent
tripel
really
easy
to
drink
and
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
long
strange
tripel
is
delicious
if
a
bit
sweet
and
thin
for
a
tripel
the
high
abv
is
not
noticable
while
drinking
it
which
along
with
the
flavor
makes
this
a
dangerous
ale
its
very
versatile
though
because
the
flavor
and
feel
would
be
appropriate
to
warm
weather
or
a
special
occasion
o
this
is
probably
the
best
american
brewed
tripel
that
ive
tried
the
drinkability
is
perfect
and
flavors
are
so
well
balanced
great
beer
o
this
is
a
great
tripel
holds
its
own
to
the
belgian
beers
and
brings
a
new
personality
some
big
spicy
and
yeasty
flavors
lots
of
clove
and
fruit
with
big
white
pepper
spice
on
the
finish
this
is
quite
dry
and
spicy
coats
the
mouth
nicely
a
big
beer
with
a
lot
of
personality
booze
will
certainly
sneak
up
on
you
with
this
one
boulevard
appears
to
be
getting
it
right
with
this
tripel
o
a
solid
tripel
that
i
will
certainly
buy
again
now
that
its
showing
up
in
california
dry
fruity
crisp
and
technically
very
sound
o
a
very
delicious
tripel
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
ive
had
definitely
recommended
o
a
great
example
overall
there
is
nothing
lacking
here
you
get
spice
fruit
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
it
reminds
me
of
some
trappist
tripels
that
are
outstanding
st
bernardus
tripel
and
westmalle
tripel
might
be
slightly
better
but
not
by
a
lot
o
for
9
abv
its
extremely
drinkable
a
mix
of
light
fruit
bubblegum
earthy
and
candy
like
sweetness
its
a
very
enjoyable
brew
this
tastes
more
belgian
than
most
tripels
ive
had
certainly
one
thats
worth
seeking
out
and
its
an
education
in
the
style
not
to
mention
being
a
relative
bargain
bought
at
my
local
ibis
market
in
mission
hills
san
diego
really
wellbalanced
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
finest
american
brewed
tripels
available
and
compares
favorably
with
many
of
its
belgian
counterparts
the
color
of
the
clear
body
was
a
highly
attractive
golden
yellow
and
the
pour
formed
a
three
finger
head
being
fed
by
lots
of
carbonation
streamers
the
nose
has
a
distinct
aroma
of
lemons
and
coriander
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
due
to
a
sweet
biscuit
like
flavor
there
were
notes
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
in
the
taste
and
the
finish
was
very
dry
the
beer
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
hid
the
high
carbonation
level
very
well
reminded
me
a
lot
of
duvel
in
the
overall
construction
which
is
a
great
thing
in
my
book
a
well
done
tripel
and
a
great
beer
overall
i
dont
normally
migrate
toward
tripels
especially
american
versions
and
for
no
good
reason
this
was
a
good
brew
quite
good
overall
a
seriously
tasty
beer
it
could
be
more
complex
but
it
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
tripels
are
admittedly
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
could
definately
drink
morw
of
this
it
opens
up
well
as
it
warms
and
its
quite
pleasing

cambridge

has
great
what
i
believe
to
be
phish
references
overall
this
is
very
nice
not
great
but
a
very
good
tripel
gladly
my
beer
cellar
survived
sandy
a
pretty
good
trippel
leaning
towards
a
heavy
saison
not
really
the
right
style
for
the
season
however
the
high
alcohol
content
is
making
this
heatless
night
right
no
electricity
no
heat
but
this
boulevard
beer
is
making
things
ok
tonight
othis
tripel
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
ill
admit
that
it
took
me
until
the
second
glass
from
the
bomber
before
i
began
to
enjoy
it
there
was
the
typical
tripel
spice
profile
but
i
missed
a
lot
of
the
banana
and
yeast
flavors
that
i
was
expecting
nevertheless
it
was
complex
and
interesting
enough
to
keep
drinking
i
really
enjoyed
this
tripel
this
was
my
first
i
loved
everything
about
this
beer
from
the
the
color
taste
and
overall
drinkabilty
great
beer
i
was
not
used
to
opening
a
corked
bottle
but
the
effort
was
worth
the
wait
i
will
definately
buy
this
brew
again

this
is
a
very
solid
tripel
in
my
opinion
not
as
spiceforward
as
a
lot
of
others
and
not
as
fruity
or
dry
as
a
bspa
just
balanced
in
a
lot
of
ways
it
may
not
quite
compare
to
the
best
examples
of
the
style
but
this
is
easydrinking
smooth
and
very
satisfying
itd
be
a
very
good
intro
to
the
style
for
those
not
familiar
with
it
actually
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
this
againjust
a
very
solid
tripel
o
one
of
the
best
belgian
tripels
ive
had
this
side
if
the
pond
highly
recommend
pours
an
almostclear
golden
color
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
that
takes
some
time
to
go
down
a
small
amount
of
floaties
in
this
one
scent
is
spicy
and
yeasty
as
a
good
tripel
should
be
lovely
pear
and
green
apple
aromas
with
some
nice
peppery
spices
hints
of
white
grapes
as
well
taste
is
tart
white
grape
at
first
followed
by
fresh
pear
and
finishes
with
green
apple
nice
balance
of
fruity
and
spicy
great
belgian
yeast
flavors
and
definitely
one
of
the
spicier
tripels
some
definite
hop
bitterness
but
well
balanced
by
the
spice
and
fruits
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisp
dry
and
tingly
drinkability
is
very
high
as
the
abv
is
wellhidden
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
great
tripel
i
think
ive
come
to
realize
that
boulevard
knows
exactly
what
theyre
doing
when
it
come
to
belgianstyle
ales
o
this
is
a
wonderful
american
tripel
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
green
flashs
classic
version
with
the
heavy
fruit
character
and
the
nice
spice
undercurrent
clearly
american
in
its
approach
well
worth
seeking
out
what
a
long
strange
trip
its
been
medium
to
full
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
peppery
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
9
00
abv
one
of
the
best
american
versions
of
a
tripel
i
have
tried
to
date
notes
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
a
tremendous
example
of
a
tripel
nice
and
sweet
with
non
citrus
fruit
notes
all
through
it
cheers
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
o
enjoyable
but
far
from
the
best
tripel
i
have
ever
had
overall
its
very
complex
too
complex
for
me
to
figure
it
out
try
this
one
if
you
have
the
chance
o
3
5
o
id
drink
this
beer
again
definitely
and
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
guess
thats
one
of
the
best
endorsements
i
can
give
a
beer
this
is
a
quietly
superb
belgianstyle
ale
balanced
and
drinkable
to
the
core
as
far
as
ameribelgos
go
i
might
even
drink
this
over
a
hennepin
and
thats
saying
something
o
im
impressed
boulevard
puts
out
some
great
belgians
overall
a
tasty
refreshing
tripel
a
super
solid
tripel
o
as
good
as
an
american
tripel
can
be
well
done
boulevard
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
a
boulevard
brew
as
they
have
a
pretty
good
reputation
which
i
am
happy
to
say
is
confirmed
d
really
nice
this
tripel
has
a
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
that
one
almost
never
sees
in
american
brewed
examples
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
very
well
done
this
is
a
good
brew
that
is
easily
drank
it
is
very
smooth
and
almost
light
hops
are
very
light
in
taste
overall
excellent
beer
at
a
decent
price
and
readily
available
o
i
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
every
time
i
saw
it
in
the
store
i
would
start
to
grab
it
but
decided
not
to
this
was
well
worth
the
wait
the
rich
candy
and
fruit
mixed
with
the
subtle
bitterness
all
in
a
creamy
succulent
body
and
given
abv
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
by
far
an
outstanding
triple
another
satisfying
smokestack
serving
type
bottle
o
any
highgravity
monster
of
a
beer
that
i
can
polish
off
an
entire
750ml
bottle
with
the
proper
amount
of
time
and
patience
of
has
to
be
damn
good
by
no
means
is
it
a
chugger
but
goddamnit
its
friday
so
by
god
im
drinking
this
whole
bottle
by
myself
boulevard
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
and
id
gladly
pick
up
again
in
the
mood
bottle
oi
enjoyed
this
beer
honestly
i
do
not
think
i
would
buy
more
then
one
or
two
i
have
aging
allagash
and
even
fresh
i
feel
it
surpasses
maybe
i
am
biased
but
this
was
not
the
best
i
have
had
all
and
all
a
good
experience
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
alcohol
should
be
better
hidden
but
otherwise
very
good
originally
reviewed
09272011
its
a
real
solid
tripel
nothing
too
mindbending
or
blowing
or
makes
me
want
to
really
have
again
but
its
a
good
solid
brew
sort
of
reminds
me
of
averys
nineteen
similar
butterscoth
flavor
but
this
one
is
more
balanced
and
understated
pours
a
chaotic
hazy
gold
color
with
maybe
a
4
inch
head
in
this
tulip
glass
pure
white
smells
fruity
like
peaches
and
pears
but
not
sweet
also
notes
of
butterscotch
floral
hops
and
one
hell
of
a
fun
yeast
flavor
is
great
too
very
fruity
at
first
then
tempered
by
the
yeast
which
has
some
spice
to
it
touch
of
candy
sugar
sweetness
in
the
finish
which
itself
is
mellowed
by
more
hops
that
is
common
in
a
tripel
feel
is
eipc
smooth
and
brightly
carbonated
drinkable
forever
medium
body
this
is
a
complex
brew
that
is
worthy
of
its
grateful
dead
inspired
name
i
bought
it
for
that
reason
and
am
happy
i
did
the
smokestack
series
is
maybe
one
of
the
best
big
beer
series
in
the
country
right
now
they
have
all
been
unique
and
cash
money
delicious
gotta
check
out
this
brewery
on
my
next
trip
back
east
overall
a
solid
tripel
this
is
the
perfect
alternative
for
fans
of
le
fin
jd
who
kidnapped
the
monks
and
put
them
in
kansas
city
long
strange
provides
a
quality
beer
experience
with
plenty
to
talk
about
appearance
is
yellow
some
clouds
a
fluffy
two
finger
white
head
its
nose
contains
orange
candied
sugar
and
lemon
while
this
tripel
style
has
a
taste
of
apricot
coriander
spice
and
caramel
although
it
is
a
variety
of
flavors
none
of
them
seem
to
stand
out
or
present
themselves
as
overbearing
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
there
is
crispness
to
the
finish
a
very
good
tripel
from
boulevard
but
not
quite
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
for
beer
is
strikingly
dry
theres
no
caramely
aftertaste
or
high
final
gravity
typical
of
unfermented
candi
sugar
in
syrupy
belgian
style
ales
no
alcohol
heat
to
betray
the
9
abv
but
the
dryness
is
completented
perfectly
by
a
healthy
wet
hopping
spicy
and
peppery
theres
an
intensity
of
flavor
in
this
beer
that
suggests
it
might
be
chalky
or
burn
out
your
palate
but
amazingly
theres
zero
aftertaste
theres
ample
carbonation
which
upon
reflection
works
fantastically
with
this
tripel
nice
looking
belgian
dark
wheat
color
with
14
whie
head
with
some
lacing
floral
aroma
belgian
hops
some
light
citrus
flavors
alcohol
was
well
masked
enjoyable
and
more
complex
when
it
warmed
i
like
this
better
than
the
quad
but
a
different
style
o
a
super
yeasty
and
spicy
tripel
mostly
overpowering
everything
else
doesnt
make
it
bad
at
all
in
fact
i
quite
liked
it
o
boulevard
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
with
their
long
strange
tripel
aroma
and
feel
resemble
that
of
a
straightfrombelgium
tripel
while
the
appearance
is
pretty
disappointing
this
smokestack
series
beer
can
certainly
hold
its
own
against
imports
i
absolutely
loved
this
poured
a
3
champagne
velvet
head
with
a
long
life
and
floating
merengues
the
body
is
a
hazy
gold
and
the
effervescence
persists
it
smells
of
belgian
sugar
malt
and
a
touch
of
sour
the
taste
is
rich
indulgence
mirroring
all
those
smells
but
also
adding
tropical
fruit
highlights
fairly
long
finish
my
only
complaint
is
i
dont
really
think
theres
anything
strange
about
it
but
thats
just
a
name
overall
i
let
the
beer
warm
some
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
poured
it
into
the
correct
glassware
everything
i
just
dont
know
if
the
tripel
is
really
my
style
i
certainly
lean
more
towards
the
english
style
ales
than
the
belgian
or
german
and
this
didnt
help
that
out
i
think
i
will
give
this
one
another
chance
one
day
but
not
if
i
have
to
pay
for
it
o
wonderful
really
enjoyed
this
another
solid
offering
from
boulevard
o
very
impressed
with
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
almost
teeters
on
an
ipa
style
with
out
the
hop
bitterness
which
helped
me
enjoy
this
as
muc
has
i
did
overall
good
triple
not
great
i
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
fruit
presence
in
the
flavor
overall
a
well
done
beer
ive
been
trying
to
get
more
into
belgians
and
this
one
helps
out
a
lot
somewhat
sweeter
than
i
expected
but
maybe
with
a
little
longer
aging
the
yeast
would
finish
off
some
of
the
sweetness
o
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
it
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
ive
been
supremely
impressed
with
a
lot
of
the
boulevard
smokestack
series
beers
but
this
one
isnt
on
the
same
level
as
some
of
the
others
all
that
being
said
its
a
pretty
decent
tripel
750
ml
bottle
into
chalice
bottled
04242009
so
this
is
pushing
on
3
years
old
pours
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
12
finger
fairly
dense
light
khaki
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
nice
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
streaming
up
aromas
of
big
lemon
apple
orange
peel
apricot
biscuit
toffee
pepper
clove
and
yeast
spices
nice
and
very
well
balanced
tripel
aromas

biscuit
toffee
pepper
clove
herbal
honey
and
yeast
spices
lingering
notes
of
citrus
biscuit
pepper
and
spices
on
the
finish
for
a
while
great
balance
of
flavors
with
no
cloying
sweetness
at
all
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
very
smooth
to
drink
at
9
but
is
still
a
bit
of
a
sipper
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
and
well
done
tripel
that
has
held
up
nicely
over
the
years
nice
flavor
balance
and
smooth
drinkablility
overall
it
was
a
really
nice
tripel
d
a
great
example
of
the
style
theres
nothing
extraordinarily
unique
about
it
but
its
damn
good
and
ill
have
it
again
feels
full
in
body
with
mild
carbonation
oily
slick
and
warming
in
the
end
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
tripel
but
i
wish
it
had
just
a
little
more
body
to
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
back
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grains
spices
yeast
and
some
sugaryhoney
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
slight
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
light
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
with
some
delicious
aromas
and
flavors
i
use
this
one
to
introduce
friends
and
family
to
a
tripel
style
beer
overall
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
triple
matches
some
of
the
best
ive
had
from
belgium
or
canada
o
a
delicious
beer
well
worth
finding
again
boulevard
continues
to
impress
and
it
may
be
my
sleeper
brewery
of
the
year
this
is
an
extremely
good
tripel
has
the
right
feel
and
flavors
to
go
with
it
o
pretty
good
tripel
fruit
forward
with
less
focus
on
spiceyeast
drank
very
easily
would
have
it
again
its
surely
been
one
amiright
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
lightly
offcreamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
clove
banana
slightly
waxy
orange
peel
cracked
wheat
sweet
flowers
and
the
slightest
possible
kiss
of
lemon
zest
the
taste
shows
off
more
of
the
orange
now
complete
with
some
flesh
and
wheat
but
the
rest
is
still
easily
found
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
eversoslightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
unsurprising
seeing
as
it
comes
from
the
qualityproducers
at
boulevard
good
times
very
highly
recommended
and
a
personal
favorite
overall
it
fits
the
sweet
upfront
bitter
at
the
finish
tripel
profile
the
white
fruit
meaning
pear
and
apple
flavors
make
it
a
bit
unique
however
the
finish
keeps
this
from
being
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
glad
i
tried
it
but
there
are
many
other
tripels
i
prefer
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
light
fruitiness
and
just
a
note
of
candy
sugar
in
the
taste
a
nice
fruitiness
dryer
yeast
and
a
mellow
presence
of
candy
sugar
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
fruit
and
note
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
nice
fruitiness
and
hides
the
abv
well
well
its
a
good
beer
very
standard
for
the
style
nice
malts
spices
belgian
yeast
fruit
esters
nice
warming
booze
perfect
beer
for
bunkering
down
in
the
middle
of
a
very
early
season
blizzard
with
no
electricity
good
for
keeping
warm
o
lst
is
a
nice
tripel
that
could
reach
unbelievable
with
a
couple
of
really
easy
fixes
of
more
carbonation
and
toning
down
the
alcohol
component
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
was
a
tasty
tripel
with
really
good
mouthfeel
would
try
this
again
the
taste
is
stronger
on
the
alcohol
side
than
the
smell
indicates
also
there
is
a
stronger
peppery
taste
particularly
in
the
swallow
the
start
is
almost
creamy
the
body
is
full
and
the
carbonation
is
high
like
a
good
tripel
perhaps
the
highest
praise
i
can
give
is
that
this
seems
to
be
indistinguishable
from
the
excellent
tripels
from
belgium
overall
this
is
arguably
the
best
tripel
i
have
had
so
far
i
love
how
clean
it
is
and
the
spicing
seems
just
about
right
i
could
certainly
see
myself
picking
this
up
again
overall
a
very
good
borderline
great
triple
flavorful
and
tasty
would
definitely
revisit
a
very
good
tripel
but
i
would
like
to
see
the
carbonation
toned
down
to
improve
the
mouthfeel
ive
traded
this
away
many
times
and
am
somewhat
embarrassed
that
i
have
never
actually
had
it
myself
so
here
we
go
this
bottle
was
so
difficult
to
get
the
cork
out
of
that
i
almost
used
a
wine
opener
to
get
into
it
seriously
difficult
my
wife
said
i
hope
its
worth
it
after
finally
getting
the
cork
out
it
let
out
a
large
pop
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
color
huge
fluffy
head
fills
the
glass
retention
for
days
before
i
can
actually
drink
it
beautiful
really
smell
tart
cherries
lemon
citrus
bisquity
bready
aroma
taste
nice
sweet
and
tart
cherries
followed
by
a
dry
bitterness
some
watery
qualities
to
it
but
not
a
knock
on
the
beer
at
all
this
is
refreshing
complex
and
overall
hides
the
9
abv
like
a
charm
glad
to
be
able
to
get
this
year
round
yet
another
solid
offering
from
boulevards
smokestack
series
i
picked
up
a
bomber
of
this
one
at
lukas
liquors
a
while
back
and
eagerly
looked
forward
to
cracking
it
open
poured
an
opaque
golden
color
with
a
large
prickly
white
head
aromas
of
bubblegum
yeast
candi
sugar
and
white
pepper
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
bubblegum
spice
lemon
pepper
yeast
and
candi
sugar
quite
enjoyable
great
beer
packed
with
flavor
the
only
strange
thing
about
this
tripel
is
how
little
it
strays
from
the
best
belgian
examples
of
the
style
well
done
o
hands
down
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
and
easily
the
best
belgian
ive
had
from
an
american
brewery
i
want
more
very
refreshing
great
mouthfeel
highly
enjoyable
beer
boulevard
gets
its
grubby
american
hands
all
over
the
traditional
belgian
tripel
and
finishes
with
a
beer
that
is
bound
to
turn
off
the
most
purist
of
the
beer
drinkers
however
the
long
strange
tripel
is
really
only
different
and
not
inherently
inferior
it
lands
right
in
the
middle
on
the
totem
poll
and
maybe
even
a
bit
higher
depending
on
what
mood
your
tongue
is
in
the
appearance
actually
forebodes
what
the
beer
has
to
offer
its
a
deep
amber
color
very
orange
this
differs
from
the
usual
light
and
yellowish
tint
most
tripels
have
the
head
is
slightly
off
white
about
2
fingers
worth
and
the
beer
is
wonderfully
carbonated
the
smell
is
where
the
beer
is
most
triumphant
in
its
uniqueness
i
get
a
lot
of
yeast
some
roasted
malts
and
apples
some
alcohol
is
present
along
with
more
fruits
a
richer
aroma
indeed
then
the
taste
really
kicks
your
purist
gut
and
doesnt
apologize
i
prefer
the
traditional
brew
but
clap
clap
to
boulevard
for
doing
something
new
in
a
year
round
manner
yeast
alcohol
apples
pear
roasted
flavors
highlight
a
beer
that
stands
out
but
not
really
above
the
pack
mouthfeel
is
heaviercreamier
then
most
tripels
but
is
wonderfully
carbonated
and
works
extremely
well
to
enhance
the
enjoyability
of
the
beer
overall
worth
a
taste
i
may
not
go
back
to
it
but
the
new
flavors
may
attract
some
repeat
customers
overall
very
enjoyable
and
an
uncommontasting
tripel
ovearll
a
good
tripel
but
for
10
i
would
go
with
a
st
bernardus
or
westmalle
for
a
little
more
or
a
sixer
of
new
belgium
for
a
lot
less
overall
probably
my
favorite
yearround
beer
the
boulevard
has
great
flavor
great
beer
o
a
unique
tripel
its
a
bit
thicker
and
darker
than
most
tripels
but
it
works
fairly
well
i
just
wish
it
had
a
somewhat
lighter
body
and
less
breadyeast
flavor
still
a
decent
beer
overall
and
at
least
its
not
another
sticky
sweet
bubblegum
bomb
like
many
tripels
enjoyable
and
straightforward
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
other
tripel
i
split
during
the
evenings
events
delicious
seek
it
out
ive
read
that
this
is
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
while
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
w
the
tripels
or
even
some
of
the
belgians
for
that
matter
i
have
to
say
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
now
i
have
a
solid
idea
from
this
some
others
what
to
look
for
in
a
tripel
prosit
o
honestly
this
is
absolutely
the
best
tripel
ive
had
in
a
while
maybe
its
because
i
dig
boulevards
taste
profile
in
this
setting
dunno
but
this
one
worked
for
me
drinkability
a
nice
flavorful
drink
unfortunately
this
doesnt
make
it
to
ohio
so
one
and
done
for
me
this
is
a
nice
little
tripel
from
the
good
old
usa
i
think
i
paid
about
8
for
this
bottle
when
i
bought
it
i
would
say
that
makes
this
beer
a
nice
value
well
made
and
nicely
drinkable
o
a
good
tripel
for
drinkabilitys
sake
id
rather
have
a
new
belgium
trippel
but
this
boulevard
entry
may
be
more
true
to
the
style
of
the
smokestack
series
ive
tried
thus
far
id
rate
this
ahead
of
the
seeyoulator
dopplebock
and
below
tank
7
well
done
boulevard
this
smokestack
series
continues
to
impress
750ml
bottle
courtesy
of
jrorie
pours
a
hazy
apricot
color
with
quick
dissipating
head
lots
of
carbonation
aroma
has
candied
sugar
and
dried
fruit
taste
is
sweet
with
a
bit
our
sour
bitterness
is
very
low
and
reminds
me
of
citrus
peel
medium
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
finish
is
smooth
with
the
alcohol
noticeable
mostly
because
it
warms
the
throat
and
chest
the
sweetness
is
a
tad
to
the
high
side
but
its
a
pretty
nice
beer
id
drink
this
again
with
pleasure
d
interesting
tripel
here
reminded
me
of
an
amped
up
wit
or
weiss
bier
pretty
different
tripel
nice
hint
of
yeast
and
bread
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
peppery
and
not
as
sweet
as
other
tripels
ive
had
which
is
fine
alcohol
noticable
in
the
finish
may
want
to
age
a
bit
to
smooth
out
but
a
nice
tripel
nonetheless
i
like
to
start
my
reviews
in
the
order
of
the
way
one
would
drink
the
beer
so
to
start
it
has
a
nice
amber
look
to
it
with
a
little
murky
tinge
to
it
if
not
poured
properly
you
will
get
a
lot
of
head
not
a
bad
thing
but
just
delays
drinking
the
sweet
nectar
long
strange
is
a
very
sweet
and
sour
beer
i
taste
oranges
and
lemons
the
finish
is
very
sweet
almost
like
biting
into
a
piece
of
candy
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
well
made
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
an
after
dinner
drink
cheers
pours
a
golden
color
w
a
three
finger
egg
colored
head
which
lingers
a
little
bit
carbonation
is
pretty
high
w
this
beer
smell
is
that
of
spice
corriander
yeast
lemon
peel
citrus
smelling
without
being
overbearing
nice
taste
is
that
of
corriander
spices
yeast
the
alcohol
at
9
is
completely
hidden
to
me
id
almost
like
a
little
alcohol
burn
on
this
one
just
like
my
favorite
belgian
tripels
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
light
and
the
aftertaste
doesnt
stick
around
forever
medium
range
length
for
the
aftertaste
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
tripel
and
im
really
glad
work
sent
me
to
a
part
of
the
country
this
was
available
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
on
the
higher
side
overall
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
had
some
nice
flavors
to
it
and
was
pretty
drinkable
as
well
not
bad
with
regards
to
style
either
this
is
a
good
beverage
i
think
it
to
be
worth
the
sampling
opinion
i
am
really
happy
with
this
beer
it
is
undoubtedly
a
tripel
and
it
definitely
holds
water
against
the
classic
examples
of
this
style
so
i
think
that
is
saying
a
whole
lot
so
kudos
to
boulevard
and
their
brewmaster
that
said
i
would
pick
up
st
bernardus
or
others
over
this
one
but
they
didnt
come
from
the
states
and
that
is
a
plus
for
this
beer
as
you
dont
get
this
high
of
a
quality
tripel
from
the
us
very
often
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
no
head
on
a
tripelare
you
kidding
me
bad
bad
bad
no
good
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
malt
with
some
very
light
phenols
taste
has
a
bit
of
bread
with
light
yeast
character
not
impressed
feel
is
light
with
low
carbonation
overall
not
impressed
this
is
nowhere
near
a
tripel
let
alone
a
good
one
now
comes
the
imortant
question
anyone
got
a
recipe
d
drinkability
easy
to
drink
tripel
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
with
a
friend
and
could
easily
have
popped
another
one
now
onto
a
chimay
drink
outstanding
for
a
us
tripel
loved
it
d
fairly
decent
pretty
good
bang
for
the
buck
a
bit
high
in
the
abv
but
a
nice
one
to
share
with
friends
mouthfeel
lowmedium
body
with
slightly
coating
feel
to
it
alcohol
is
hardly
present
even
at
9
i
would
like
to
feel
more
carbonation
andor
hops
on
the
finish
just
to
give
it
a
zing
otherwise
it
drank
very
well
and
pounded
the
whole
bottle
rather
quickly
excellent
d
for
an
american
belgian
tripel
thsi
is
quite
close
to
some
of
the
best
authentic
belgian
beers
they
havent
messed
with
the
style
and
it
is
quite
enjoyable
i
would
buy
this
again
d
wheres
the
fresh
orange
oh
wait
wrong
tripel
my
head
is
still
focused
on
tripel
sec
this
is
an
admirable
entry
into
the
tripel
realm
solid
flavor
and
little
in
the
way
of
booziness
despite
the
bigger
strength
i
prefer
this
to
the
westmalle
tripel
i
had
last
night
very
flavorful
i
wish
i
could
get
more
of
boulevards
big
beers
notes
not
entirely
sure
what
to
think
of
this
the
flavors
were
nice
but
then
i
thought
they
got
to
be
a
little
overwhelming
strong
on
the
spices
but
a
slight
sweetness
in
the
background
d
very
good
and
would
recommend
all
in
all
its
a
good
example
of
style
perhaps
not
my
favorite
but
its
solid
a
bit
disappointed
at
the
lack
of
spiciness
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
to
medium
body
with
some
fine
carbonation
that
makes
this
beer
pretty
smooth
this
beer
is
9
alcohol
and
it
really
is
hidden
very
well
its
not
my
favorite
tripel
that
ive
had
but
a
decent
brew
nonetheless
i
drank
a
different
beer
while
this
one
warmed
up
it
got
fairly
warm
but
it
is
very
appealing
nice
carbonation
and
medium
body
very
drinkable
i
could
not
detect
alcohol
it
is
like
i
could
drink
more
of
this
but
i
know
better
these
guys
are
turning
into
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
have
yet
to
have
one
of
their
big
bottles
that
i
didnt
like
boulevard
i
married
my
best
friend
there
and
we
keep
coming
back
to
the
gorgeous
brews
to
be
had
overallnotes
first
time
using
this
glass
maudite
snifter
found
it
cheap
while
the
appearance
isnt
all
that
grand
it
tastes
fantastic
and
should
be
appreciated
finally
a
really
good
missouri
beer
im
proud
of
my
state
lots
of
toasted
fruit
flavors
mixed
with
some
very
light
caramel
malt
flavors
te
carbonation
gives
teh
palate
a
dry
pop
at
the
front
the
alcohol
just
warms
and
relaxes
the
palate
and
body
pretty
good
a
terrifically
easy
drinking
brew
well
done
boulevard
d
i
think
the
dryness
of
this
one
makes
it
stand
out
against
other
tripels
very
impressive
looks
like
someone
did
their
homework
before
jumping
feet
first
into
this
belgian
style
kudos
to
boulevard
for
this
most
excellent
tripel
d
alcohol
will
hit
you
but
this
is
still
a
good
drinking
tripel
average
drinkability
due
to
the
thickness
but
perfect
the
way
it
is
wouldnt
want
them
to
change
it
for
anything
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
prefer
it
on
the
cooler
side
say
45f
hmmm
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
has
some
carbonation
on
the
palate
beer
finishes
slightly
dry
with
an
out
of
place
bitterness
on
the
back
that
makes
this
beer
slightly
hard
to
drink
not
my
favorite
tripel
for
sure
and
i
say
all
this
despite
the
high
abv
a
parameter
that
i
tend
to
prefer
around
the
56
range
generally
at
least
for
everyday
use
and
have
difficulty
with
when
its
up
in
the
8
0
and
higher
range
not
today
this
9
tripel
blows
that
theory
out
of
the
water
delicious
a
five
on
taste
for
sure
and
an
amazing
5
on
drinkability
well
worth
the
price
i
paid
for
it
7
50
i
cant
wait
to
get
another
im
bringing
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
for
special
occasions
with
my
closest
contacts
for
sure
this
is
a
very
solid
example
of
the
tripel
style
certainly
one
of
the
better
american
versions
ive
had
it
retains
a
very
belgian
nature
while
also
expressing
an
americanness
mostly
because
of
hops
worth
drinking
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
large
frothy
offwhite
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
with
good
lacing
moderate
to
heavy
citrus
yeast
and
small
alcohol
aroma
medium
body
with
a
smooth
sticky
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
duration
solid
complex
brew
d
you
dont
feel
the
9abv
until
you
have
finished
the
beer
it
never
peaks
out
and
the
crispness
of
this
beer
makes
it
quite
thirst
quenching
another
boulevard
smokestack
beer
that
impresses
me
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
some
of
their
regular
offerings
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
orange
citrus
with
belgian
yeast
spices
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
is
alcohol
citrus
oranges
and
pears
with
some
coriander
pepper
and
belgian
yeast
the
alcohol
is
rather
strong
in
the
aftertaste
medium
mouthfeel
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
d
a
unique
and
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
apparent
but
the
enjoyable
flavors
to
this
keep
this
drinkable
i
prefer
this
over
many
belgian
examples
overall
very
good
pick
some
up
if
you
can
find
it
d
substantial
flavor
and
body
in
a
tripel
that
not
too
overdone
d
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
boulevard
is
probably
the
most
underrated
brewery
in
the
country
pretty
damn
good
and
recommended
i
love
all
the
sweet
and
juicy
spiciness
this
smokestack
offering
provides
yummy
stuff
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
i
would
pick
up
this
bottle
again
thanks
buddy
for
having
me
over
to
try
drinkability
high
this
one
disappeared
looks
like
theres
tapioca
suspended
in
there
d
like
a
mashup
of
a
hefeweizen
and
a
tripel
in
my
book
thats
a
good
thing
i
continue
to
enjoy
boulevards
smokestack
series
well
done
if
you
are
looking
for
a
more
bythebook
tripel
you
might
want
to
look
elsewhere
maybe
i
just
wasnt
in
the
mood
for
this
but
i
really
didnt
enjoy
much
i
cant
say
it
was
bad
but
the
tripel
is
definetly
a
different
beer
style
i
have
had
several
of
the
other
smokestack
series
and
enjoyed
them
all
very
well
just
dont
know
on
this
one
right
now
extremely
drinkable
for
the
9
abv
a
really
wellcrafted
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
american
examples
of
this
style
that
ive
had
long
strange
tripel
was
a
different
beer
it
had
some
similarities
to
a
hefeweizen
it
is
a
dark
yellow
color
with
white
head
that
lingers
you
can
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
it
is
9
that
might
affect
the
drinkability
for
some
overall
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
my
favorite
although
not
up
to
my
standard
for
this
style
which
is
la
fin
du
monde
still
a
nice
beer
it
is
a
bit
spicier
than
usual
which
makes
it
an
interesting
choice
this
one
is
very
reasonably
priced
here
making
it
an
excellent
bargain
drinkability
is
pretty
high
given
the
abv
this
is
a
really
excellent
tripel
im
really
looking
forward
to
trying
some
other
beers
in
boulevards
smokestack
series
d
easy
drinking
here
especially
for
a
triple
definitely
not
for
everyone
but
this
beer
will
be
in
heavy
rotation
in
my
collection
drinkability
decently
drinkable
i
suppose
for
the
abv
but
the
alcohol
and
mouthfeel
combined
make
for
a
brew
thats
a
bit
hard
to
get
down
in
any
greater
quantity
than
slowly
sipping
it
i
wish
the
rest
of
this
brew
held
up
to
the
appearance
and
nose
which
were
phenomenal
drinkability
a
very
solid
tripel
and
one
id
be
happy
to
try
again
sure
it
has
its
flaws
a
little
chemically
in
places
too
phenolic
and
spicy
in
others
the
yeast
strain
on
this
one
was
a
kicker
no
doubt
but
on
the
whole
it
has
more
plusses
than
minuses
and
that
makes
it
a
winner
in
my
book
id
love
for
them
to
brett
this
one
like
they
did
with
the
saison
now
thatd
be
something
to
taste
at
9
0
abv
its
a
little
on
the
top
end
but
again
not
so
much
for
the
style
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
is
a
strong
point
for
this
beer
a
really
enjoyable
and
quaffable
american
triple
this
stays
true
enought
to
the
style
while
not
being
as
intimidating
as
some
others
a
good
effort
by
blvd
d
yet
another
excellent
boulevard
smokestack
series
beer
delicious
and
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
quite
amazing
therefore
the
5
drinkability
is
amazing
as
well
seeing
as
i
consumed
this
within
45
minutes
not
remarkably
complex
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
well
hidden
there
is
a
bit
of
a
flat
quality
to
the
flavor
maybe
aging
isnt
so
good
if
thats
the
issue
the
initial
aroma
had
a
great
fruity
quality
that
i
was
never
able
to
capture
again
anywhere
else
in
the
drink
nonetheless
this
is
drinking
just
fine
finishing
off
the
750ml
solo
wont
be
a
significant
issue
i
would
say
get
some
around
here
the
price
is
quite
good
by
comparison
and
the
ale
stands
up
with
anything
for
drinkability
though
the
depth
is
a
bit
lacking
finally
got
to
try
the
boulevard
tripel
unfortunately
i
was
a
little
let
down
not
quite
as
flavorful
and
complex
as
i
hoped
especially
after
i
was
impressed
by
their
quad
still
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
was
worth
the
8
lastly
while
this
didnt
factor
into
the
score
i
did
love
the
bottle
and
the
name
but
i
love
the
grateful
dead
song
in
question
i
found
this
beer
at
a
local
grocery
store
that
had
about
two
dozen
good
micros
a
belowaverage
selection
for
this
area
among
those
however
was
a
case
of
this
stuff
for
8
99
a
bottle
i
dont
know
what
the
beer
buyer
there
was
thinking
but
i
shall
be
patronizing
this
store
again
soon
d
a
good
tripel
that
hides
the
alcohol
fairly
well
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
effort
at
a
belgian
style
tripel
poured
a
large
foamy
frothy
white
head
and
a
load
of
lace
aroma
is
subdued
flavors
spot
on
has
that
belgian
vineous
character
the
belgian
version
might
be
a
tab
more
dry
and
crisp
this
one
has
plenty
of
body
and
a
hair
less
carbonated
feel
the
booze
tasty
well
i
dont
think
this
is
the
best
tasting
since
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
i
dont
recall
this
much
chalkymusty
character
perhaps
this
bottle
is
too
old
its
hard
to
say
since
it
only
has
an
undecipherable
bottling
code
stay
tuned
for
another
review
with
a
hopefully
younger
and
better
bottle
poured
a
corked
and
caged
750
into
my
smokestack
chalice
this
beer
pours
a
burnt
apricot
with
a
massively
tight
creamy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
double
ipa
like
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
really
sticky
lacing
the
head
retention
is
amazing
there
is
always
a
half
inch
head
sitting
on
top
of
the
beer
boulevard
has
mad
a
really
pretty
beer
the
aroma
is
typical
tripel
apples
pears
sweet
belgian
candy
sugar
all
tied
together
with
a
nice
belgian
yeast
spiciness
boulevard
has
mad
a
spot
on
tripel
the
flavor
profile
is
exactly
what
a
tripel
should
be
the
flavor
hits
up
front
with
orchard
fruits
imparting
overly
ripe
pears
and
crisp
green
apples
next
comes
light
pale
malts
sweet
confectioners
sugar
and
white
pepper
a
slight
green
apple
peal
twang
lingers
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
extremely
balanced
and
with
a
9
abv
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
bright
carbonation
i
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
creamier
over
all
i
think
boulevard
has
made
a
great
example
of
the
style
taste
is
also
sweet
and
spicy
with
fruity
notes
and
the
9
abv
comes
out
after
a
few
glugs
sharp
carbonation
on
the
tongue
with
average
drinkability
d
a
damn
good
american
tripel
among
the
best
i
have
had
from
this
country
really
if
they
left
everuthing
else
the
same
and
doubled
the
amount
of
yeasty
funk
flavor
this
would
rival
the
best
of
belgium
excellent
d
this
beer
is
a
bit
thin
and
light
which
is
ok
until
the
big
boozy
alcohol
heat
and
pungent
hops
bitterness
covers
up
all
the
subtle
flavors
a
solid
tripel
from
a
domestic
brewery
and
i
was
glad
i
was
able
to
obtain
many
of
the
smokestack
beers
through
a
friend
my
only
complaint
is
it
felt
a
little
too
full
in
the
body
but
i
wont
have
any
trouble
finishing
this
whole
75cl
bottle
by
myself
soft
carbonation
up
front
that
tickles
the
tongue
with
a
heavy
yeast
medium
body
lots
of
earthy
funk
that
again
is
not
sour
or
acidic
lots
of
estery
light
golden
fruit
especially
apple
pear
and
most
prominent
banana
nice
peppery
spice
with
a
bit
of
zesty
corriander
that
is
slightly
countered
by
a
subtle
malt
backbone
the
spice
is
very
prominent
up
front
and
lingers
throughout
over
the
other
flavors
into
a
long
dry
finish
which
is
slightly
bitter
the
alcohol
is
evident
in
the
flavor
but
their
is
no
warmth
whatsoever
making
this
one
dangerously
drinkable
a
bit
to
heavy
on
the
spicy
side
but
has
a
nice
full
body
and
complex
flavor
i
think
that
the
flavors
are
quite
appropriate
but
they
are
not
balances
well
with
phenols
and
other
yeast
character
the
body
makes
me
want
a
chimay
white
thanks
again
exiled
mouthfeel
is
excellent
very
well
balanced
excellent
drinkability
here
although
its
a
touch
sweet
d
for
9
its
good
i
could
throw
back
a
few
and
theres
not
anything
that
would
hold
me
back
very
sippable
as
well
but
im
just
not
crazy
about
it
over
all
mouthfeel
had
pinprick
effervescence
alcohol
sizzle
medium
to
full
bodied
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
d
refreshing
but
noticeable
abv
d
sweeter
than
other
tripels
which
suits
my
preference
very
drinkable
and
almost
no
trace
of
the
higher
abv
i
am
yet
to
be
dissapointed
with
a
smokestack
series
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
other
bas
think
it
is
good
and
my
hats
off
to
them
but
this
isnt
one
id
drink
again
no
slant
on
boulevard
intended
as
i
find
most
of
their
brews
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
this
just
wasnt
for
me
750
corked
caged
into
a
chimay
goblet
that
pop
always
makes
my
mouth
water
light
cloudy
golden
in
color
with
a
snap
crackle
pop
soapy
head
smells
of
flowers
butter
and
pepper
is
that
good
it
is
but
i
just
cant
make
it
sound
that
way
somehow
aggressive
spice
up
front
that
melts
into
a
warm
caramel
roundness
and
a
crisp
apple
finish
very
very
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
dead
on
slippery
and
very
carbonated
drinkability
i
pity
the
bottle
that
it
is
not
larger
which
is
saying
something
at
750ml
very
balanced
and
refreshing
a
note
of
alcohol
warmth
and
my
evening
just
got
an
extra
star
in
my
own
personal
michelin
guide
prost
mouthfeel
mildly
carbonated
a
little
slick
in
the
mouth
very
nice
triple
in
the
middle
of
the
smokestack
series
but
another
very
nice
effort
from
boulevard
ill
keep
buying
them
if
theyll
keep
pumping
out
fresh
brews
d
anytime
all
the
time
probably
tastes
as
good
as
a
hennepin
which
is
so
not
a
farmhouse
ale
it
isnt
funny
but
id
never
buy
one
given
the
label
great

i
enjoyed

drinkability

pin

this

not

as
others
ive
had
to
date
conclusion
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
and
a
great
value
in
retail
stores
for
around
7
99
this
was
on
special
at
kellehers
for
9
00
a
bottle
what
a
steal
the
depth
and
attention
to
detail
that
this
tripel
provides
is
topnotch
this
truly
takes
the
great
tripels
you
know
and
love
and
takes
it
up
several
notches
i
love
the
americanized
edge
yet
the
reminiscent
spot
on
take
on
the
belgian
tripel
style
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
tripels
and
this
one
definitely
impresses
very
nice
work

very

boulevard
has
stepped
up
their
game
in
the
last
year
or
so
with
the
release
of
their
smokestack
series
long
strange
tripel
is
one
of
the
best
american
examples
on
the
market
without
a
doubt
in
my
mind
thanks

this
is
a
great

of
the
style
if
this
were
a
blind
tasting
i
would
be
sure
this
was
a
belgian
import
fantastic
job
boulevard
would
love
to
have
another
one
of
these
to
put
away
for
a
while
big
thanks
to
springdogg
for
the
chance
on
this
one
this
is
a
wonderfully
authentic
tripel
the
folks
at
boulevard
seem
to
really
get
belgian
style
brews
its
nice
to
see
another
authentic
tripel
brewed
on
this
side
of
the
pond
a
750ml
corked
bottle
poured
into
my
basic
tulip
glass
the
tripel
appears
a
clear
bright
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
fizzy
bone
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
spicy
yeast
fruits
such
as
pear
pineapple
tangerine
black
pepper
notes
honey
sweet
and
dry
with
very
little
alcohol
presence
carbonation
level
is
medium
to
moderate
all
tripel
fans
should
look
for
this
one
excellent
i
have
had
a
few
trips
quads
and
the
like
and
this
is
a
must
have
ive
really
been
enjoying
the
smokestack
beers
i
picked
up
all
of
them
are
relatively
true
to
style
yet
the
put
enough
of
a
twist
to
make
them
their
own
this
one
has
a
little
something
in
the
aroma
im
thinking
a
dash
of
american
hop
ill
check
their
website
after
this
review
i
usually
dont
care
for
overly
peppery
belgians
unless
its
a
really
good
saison
but
this
one
is
fantastic
what
more
is
there
to
say
if
you
are
into
complex
challenging
craft
beer
you
need
to
try
this
drinkability
is
pretty
good
im
really
impressed
after
the
saisons
this
one
really
shows
they
know
how
to
do
belgian
blondes
for
a
stronger
tripel
its
super
tasty
clean
and
smooth
decent
price
for
the
premium
packaging
to
boot
im
looking
at
the
scores
im
giving
it
as
they
keep
creeping
up
through
the
bottle
but
i
really
cant
knock
it
further
in
any
category
really
well
done
tripel
i
didnt
even
have
to
give
it
bonus
points
for
the
overt
reference
to
my
all
time
favorite
band
overall
one
of
the
best
there
is
imo
i
love
this
stuff
so
much
drinkability
high
especially
a
little
bit
warmer
dmoderate
not
the
best
hit
from
boulevards
smokestack
series
but
by
no
means
a
miss
this
would
be
an
enjoyable
brew
to
share
with
a
few
friends
on
a
cool
spring
evening
thanks
to
ballewblake
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
750ml
bottle
batch
t8007
served
in
my
allagash
tulip
poured
a
goldenorange
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
into
a
solid
skim
spots
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
is
herbal
muted
candi
sugar
toffee
and
some
light
fruit
star
fruit
perhaps
taste
follows
nose
but
i
also
get
some
apricot
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
falls
between
light
and
mediumbodied
and
sparklingly
effervescent
not
your
typical
tripel
different
in
character
but
very
enjoyable
update
3515
still
think
this
is
too
close
to
a
saison
not
enough
bright
bite
to
match
most
tripels
that
said
it
is
delicious
recommended
overall
just
an
average
tripel
does
not
match
up
to
others
d
pretty
deceptive
for
being
9
this
one
goes
down
very
easily
i
would
recommend
sharing
it
though
nice
beer
all
the
way
around
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
another
one
of
these
d
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
american
trippel
it
has
all
the
right
notes
and
is
fairly
complex
my
only
complaint
would
be
that
the
alcohol
is
a
little
to
prominent
on
the
backend
and
gets
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
i
will
drink
it
again
for
a
change
of
pace
but
there
are
several
good
belgiums
for
around
the
same
price
i
would
buy
first

into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
somewhat
crisp
pale
orange
that
is
hazed
by
massive
amounts
of
bubbles
and
floaties
the
beer
is
topped
by
a
nice
frothy
eggshell
head
that
lasts
as
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
slight
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malt
orange
peel
and
a
touch
of
citrus
and
yeast
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
slightly
sour
fruit
and
sweet
malts
with
a
nice
spice
presence
as
well
the
beer
is
slightly
heavy
with
a
slight
syruppiness
but
still
maintaining
a
refreshing
character
this
is
a
very
respectable
american
brewed
tripel
d
this
beer
drinks
much
lighter
than
its
abv
i
had
to
make
sure
i
didnt
down
this
too
quick
the
beers
alcohol
is
almost
completely
masked
which
is
quite
the
accomplishment
with
this
much
of
it
on
hand
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
drinkability
although
it
lacks
a
little
in
the
complexity
department
the
beer
more
than
makes
up
for
it
in
drinkability
no
fusel
alcohol
flavors
that
mar
so
many
tripels
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
head
of
larger
sized
bubbles
had
this
beer
right
after
i
tried
the
saison
the
tripel
smells
almost
identical
to
the
saison
the
noticable
belgian
yeast
aromas
mixed
with
an
apple
fruit
aroma
the
taste
was
much
like
the
smell
belgian
yeast
and
slight
apple
fruit
flavor
there
was
a
nice
warm
alcohol
and
spiciness
in
the
finish
there
was
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
the
alcohol
and
spice
overpowered
the
bitterness
a
pretty
good
stab
at
a
triple
i
cant
say
if
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
but
very
enjoyable
something
i
would
recommend
750ml
bottle
8
50
clear
yellow
color
almsot
no
head
it
smells
like
spiced
apples
i
guess
this
does
taste
like
a
tripel
but
its
subtle
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
quad
and
the
saison
have
been
my
favorite
from
this
series
so
far
but
this
was
tasty
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
this
is
to
me
actually
preferable
over
duvel
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
bring
to
dinner
parties
for
the

really
enticing

the
style
of
a

the

high

and
the
associated
drynesstartness
of
a
tripel
are
lessened
by
boulevard
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
d
one
word
can
describe
this
beer
phenomenal
wonderfully
subtle
amazingly
drinkable
this
beer
is
sure
to
please
do
not
expect
an
in
your
face
brew
the
beer
has
a
million
subtle
notes
and
is
meant
to
be
savored
sit
back
deep
into
an
adirondack
chair
watch
the
sun
set
with
this
beer
accompanying
you
yeah
its
that
kind
of
beer
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
poured
into
a
375ml
chalice
glass
a
golden
coppery
color
wonderful
head
retention
doesnt
have
an
overpowering
alcohol
flavor
a
beautiful
smooth
example
it
was
my
first
beer
from
the
boulevard
brewing
co
will
be
purchasing
again
for
sure
and
looking
forward
to
trying
some
of
the
other
beers
overall
the
best
of
the
smokestack
series
ive
tried
so
far
this
double
ipa
and
saison
very
nice
to
drink
d
wow
yes
its
drinkable
problem
is
its
too
drinkable
doing
this
review
after
the
first
glass
and
cant
wait
to
tear
into
the
rest
of
the
bottle
d
a
very
quaffable
brew
damn
boulevard
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
orangeycopper
color
ale
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
spicy
yeast
with
some
fruity
ester
and
nice
belgian
malt
backbone
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
spicy
and
somewhat
peppery
yeast
and
some
fruity
ester
with
light
peach
notes
while
being
very
well
supported
by
medium
sweet
belgian
malt
full
body
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
while
alcohol
is
not
apparent
very
well
done
and
probably
one
of
my
favorite
us
brewed
tripel
long
strange
is
admittedly
a
bit
strange
but
this
is
a
good
american
tripel
and
with
some
tweaking
i
think
could
be
up
there
with
the
best
recommended
if
you
find
it
thanks
to
kkipple
still
this
is
super
balanced
and
drinkable
rich
layers
of
crystal
and
belgian
malts
unfold
and
quickly
mix
with
grassy
hops
and
fruity
yeast
esters
the
booze
balances
on
unrestrained
but
never
quite
crosses
that
threshold
instead
contributing
a
welcome
warmth
to
the
finish
as
this
tripel
warms
the
booziness
intensifies
but
it
never
becomes
unpleasant
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
consistency
and
super
wellcarbonated
bordering
on
too
much
bubble
but
like
the
alcohol
level
never
crosses
the
line
i
can
feel
my
stomach
warm
as
i
near
the
halfway
point
of
the
first
glass
smiles
pretty
solid
belgian
interpretation
herekudos
to
boulevard
very
drinkable
beer
if
i
could
stay
sober
long
enough
to
drink
more
than
1
of
these
huge
bottles
i
might
have
to
put
the
cork
back
in
just
to
see
how
the
other
half
of
the
bottle
holds
up
in
the
fridge
over
night
this
beer
pours
a
majestic
golden
pale
color
with
a
very
large
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
sometime
this
beer
looks
amazing
its
paleness
reminds
me
of
that
duvel
color
minus
the
slight
yeast
haze
this
beer
possesses
smells
of
bready
yeasts
with
some
fruitiness
to
it
as
well
taste
is
pretty
solid
on
the
sweet
breadlike
tripels
usually
have
slight
fruity
sweetness
to
it
fairly
balanced
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
pretty
well
rounded
tripel
nothing
standout
amazing
but
solid
as
an
american
offering
drink
this
is
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
could
see
my
self
getting
into
trouble
with
this
beer
probably
my
second
favorite
of
the
smokestack
series
drinkability
nice
b
eer
alcohol
heat
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
this
is
another
very
good
beer
from
the
smokestack
series
and
so
far
im
impressed
with
this
series
looking
forward
to
trying
the
others
d
a
nice
drinkable
tripel
that
offers
up
a
little
taste
of
belgium
for
the
price
point
and
being
made
in
the
usa
this
is
a
nice
treat
will
drink
again
this
is
honestly
probably
the
most
accessible
tripel
ive
ever
had
maybe
not
as
authentic
as
some
would
like
not
as
much
extreme
funky
yeastyness
but
it
is
a
really
drinkable
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
in
all
truth
one
of
the
most
exciting
beers
ive
had
recently
shows
that
american
breweries
are
capable
of
making
good
belgianstyle
ales
that
dont
taste
of
alcohol
and
arent
obvious
copycats
i
certainly
wont
give
up
my
westmalle
but
this
will
certainly
get
on
my
750
ml
rotation
around
here
drinkability
another
good
tripel
not
quite
tripel
karmeliet
but
very
good
and
quite
exceptional
for
and
american
brewer
would
not
turn
down
a
glass
of
this
d
not
an
excellent
attempt
but
a
good
one
and
an
excellent
beer
name
and
label
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
color
the
head
is
a
massive
billowy
three
inches
in
height
and
recedes
very
slowly
leaving
lace
chunks
all
over
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
passion
fruit
orange
peel
wet
hay
barnyard
funk
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
very
funky
up
front
with
citrus
fruits
kicking
in
later
on
and
then
receding
into
a
lingering
funky
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
lively
tripel
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
ive
now
fully
realized
that
this
smokestack
series
is
something
special
pours
hazy
gold
with
a
frothy
white
rocky
head
clean
fresh
aroma
of
spun
sugar
clove
apricots
straw
yeast
and
gingerbread
sweet
yet
tangy
taste
without
being
syrupy
the
combination
of
clove
and
rosemary
is
incredible
as
it
gives
it
a
taste
of
sweet
sage
more
clove
and
yeast
towards
the
back
with
the
gingerbread
cookie
finish
everything
is
subdued
without
losing
any
flavor
excellent
beer
a
very
fine
tripel
from
the
folks
at
boulevard
so
many
nuances
to
smell
and
taste
been
waiting
awhile
to
taste
the
series
and
i
was
not
disappointed
by
this
one
i
live
outside
chicago
but
am
from
kc
and
finally
found
the
beer
in
iowa
good
stuff
plenty
of
fruity
hops
step
forward
as
the
beer
breaths
yum
i
would
definatly
have
this
one
again
this
is
the
best
of
the
series
from
boulevard
brewing
co
as
far
as
the
artwork
on
the
label
if
we
graded
these
this
beer
would
get
an
a
from
me
for
the
groovy
hippyish
label
art
wow
who
knew
such
a
good
authentically
belgian
triple
would
come
out
of
kansas
city
super
impressed
with
the
smokestacks
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
well
done
boulevard
beer
starts
off
sweet
and
spicy
on
the
palate
giving
way
to
some
tart
fruit
with
a
yeasty
banana
finish
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
for
me
a
very
good
tripel
from
boulevard
probably
my
second
favorite
of
the
initial
smokestack
releases
behind
the
double
wide
drinkability
i
rarely
enjoy
tripels
unless
we
really
count
some
of
those
unibroues
as
tripels
but
this
one
did
almost
everything
right
that
most
tripels
do
wrong
for
me
the
9
goes
down
quite
nicely
never
trying
to
show
up
the
sweet
and
spicy
flavors
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
one
sitting
if
they
fixed
the
head
retention
this
beer
would
be
a
monster
this
beer
could
have
a
unibroue
sticker
thrown
on
it
and
you
wouldnt
second
guess
it
thats
a
big
compliment
in
my
book
d
i
totally
enjoyed
this
brew
and
will
trade
for
more
the
head
bubbled
up
with
a
tiny
delay
making
me
glad
that
i
poured
the
glass
only
slightly
over
half
full
the
clean
white
bubbly
head
simmered
down
quickly
however
leaving
just
this
thinner
layer
after
a
minute
or
so
by
the
time
i
finished
there
was
just
a
small
thin
ring
of
white
lacing
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
clean
and
fruity
with
an
earthy
undertone
and
a
heavy
reality
check
on
the
alcohol
content
9
the
appearance
was
a
bright
golden
hue
cloudy
and
carbonated
the
first
sip
was
a
knock
out
for
me
not
having
had
anything
else
to
drink
before
hand
whoo
thats
some
strong
beer
came
from
the
husband
but
he
drinks
bud
light
the
first
sweet
fruity
malty
hit
on
the
tongue
gave
way
to
some
crunchy
pepperish
sensations
this
beer
is
not
heavily
carbonated
and
after
the
first
initial
sips
the
alcoholburn
seemed
to
go
away
or
i
stopped
noticing
i
liked
it
a
lot
but
like
other
abbey
tripel
style
beers
i
cant
drink
too
many
they
make
me
sleepy
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
its
good
tasting
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
after
a
few
sips
you
start
to
notice
the
alcohol
heat
but
it
works
well
mouthfeel
was
fine
and
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
wouldnt
pick
this
one
up
again
i
strongly
preffered
the
sixth
glass
over
this
one
d
probably
my
favorite
of
the
series
vying
for
first
place
with
the
sixth
glass
quad
this
is
outstanding
beer
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
again
despite
the
high
price
which
really
isnt
that
high
if
you
calculate
how
many
equivalent
12
oz
4
abv
beers
are
in
this
heavy
hitting
brew
you
really
are
getting
some
bang
for
your
buck
a
medium
bodied
solid
tripel
that
is
very
authentic
and
worthy
i
think
boulevards
smokestack
series
are
top
notch
in
quality
and
style
an
american
made
belgian
style
brew
that
can
actually
compete
with
a
true
belgian
very
nice
job
here
tasty
with
subtle
fruitiness
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
tripel
another
nice
belgian
style
done
by
boulevard
there
smokestack
series
continues
to
impress
with
this
in
the
duvel
glass
and
me
kicked
back
enjoying
a
crappy
day
indoors
it
cant
get
any
more
drinkable
a
good
brew
and
i
must
say
one
of
the
best
american
takes
on
the
style
that
i
have
tried
so
far
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
huge
white
head

followed
by
a
flavor
of
bananas

a
light
finish

hops

is
smooth
and

a
smile

for

definitely
worth
trying

the

that
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised

check
it
out

still
pretty
tasty
and
a
decent
cut
at
a
difficult
beer
to
brew
but
i
doubt
if
i
would
seek
out
another
bottle
of
it
excellent
this
is
possibly
the
best
of
the
smokestack
series
that
ive
had
besides
the
saison
will
definitely
buy
this
in
the
future
for
a
solid
tripel
dwould
love
to
have
this
around
often
and
would
also
love
to
age
one
to
try
i
belive
this
would
be
the
best
of
all
the
smokestack
to
age
a
good
tripel
but
far
from
my
favorite
high
abv
ensures
limited
consumption
i
did
enjoy
this
one
more
than
boulevards
saison
split
two
ways
into
two
pint
glasses
pours
a
light
yellow
with
alot
of
carbonation
and
strong
head
smell
has
some
light
fruit
and
spice
taste
is
not
as
pronounced
as
most
tripels
but
its
certainly
not
subdued
by
any
means
a
good
amount
of
sugar
in
the
taste
not
overly
carbonated
like
alot
of
triple
making
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
d
pretty
deceiving
abv
but
damn
good
taste
if
not
a
bit
sweet
i
could
drink
this
all
night
probably
thanks
to
whoever
brought
this

the

a

a

the

is
good
has
a
sugary
aroma
to
it
with
some
citrus
in
there
too
taste
is
great
the
effervescence
on
the
tongue
is
awesome
as
is
this
the
whole
beer
i
dont
know
what
makes
a
tripel
a
tripel
maybe
the
yeast
but
it
sure
is
awesome
very
drinkable
beer
good
looking
tasty
just
a
quality
tasty
tripel
that
is
rather
true
to
style
pours
a

very
nice
tripel
thanks
russ
overall
not
a
bad
tripel
alot
of
american
versions
dont
really
come
close
but
this
is
pretty
standard
just
nothing
special
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
the
third
smokestack
series
beer
ive
tried
and
each
has
impressed
me
more
than
the
last
everything
about
it
mimicked
the
great
examples
of
the
style
their
long
strange
tripel
along
with
their
saison
are
styles
theyve
understood
and
the
result
has
been
ideal
beer
appearance
is
a
very
murky
yelloworange
despite
being
careful
to
store
upright
and
pouring
slowly
a
vigorous
white
head
nearly
clears
the
lip
of
my
tulip
glass
but
then
settles
into
about
a
centimeter
of
foam
for
the
duration
aroma
has
some
nice
esters
of
lemon
and
orange
along
with
the
familiar
spicy
belgian
yeast
characteristics
unfortunately
there
are
also
some
distinct
fusel
alcohol
aromas
akin
to
nail
polish
remover
lingering
around
flavors
of
the
same
lemon
and
orange
along
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
are
quite
nice
but
alas
the
fusel
alcohol
overcomes
the
finish
and
causes
me
to
curl
my
nose
as
i
swallow
moderate
hop
bitterness
and
the
effervescent
carbonation
may
also
contribute
to
the
dominance
of
the
fusels
as
well
this
beer
had
some
great
potential
but
the
fusels
need
to
be
removed
another
solid
smokestack
series
brew
and
a
good
sippin
tripel
thats
crafted
solidly
by
boulevard
exploding
cork
a
mild
gusher
an
alive
beer
yellow
color
with
a
full
foam
light
aromas
polishlike
with
herbs
and
light
fruits
flavor
has
nice
balance
and
a
nice
malt
and
yeast
complexity
a
lot
of
fruit
character
peach
pear
nectarine
with
the
notion
of
spices
from
the
yeast
i
really
think
its
a
beer
of
high
quality
tastes
wet
sweet
to
start
with
strong
flat
phenolic
not
clovey
and
not
quite
smokey
yellow
cake
and
esters
of
orange
rather
than
my
lemony
expectation
grassiness
from
yeast
mixes
with
the
phenolic
in
an
unpleasant
way
i
know
some
people
dig
that
flavor
but
it
makes
me
cringe
bleech
dry
finish
leaves
lingering
phenol
light
body
but
finish
isnt
quite
as
crisp
as
id
expect
in
a
tripel
outstanding
beer
an
excellent
tripel
the
smokestack
series
is
one
of
the
best
things
american
brewers
have
concocted
and
released
in
the
last
year
all
ive
tried
have
been
terrific
and
this
ranks
among
my
favorite
tripels
highly
recommended
try
this
with
an
apricot
stilton
and
you
will
not
be
dissapointed
cloudy
murky
copper
bigass
thick
crop
of
pure
snow
white
head
it
sticks
around
for
fucking
ever
lace
is
quite
full
aroma
has
warm
biscuity
malt
feeling
to
it
with
some
fruitiness
and
spiciness
as
well
also
some
cake
batter
sweetness
and
yeasty
esters
i
guess
this
smells
pretty
damn
good
as
it
turns
out
it
tastes
pretty
damn
good
too
the
cake
doughiness
transfers
to
the
palate
nicely
and
thats
a
quality
i
love
in
tripels
sweet
yellow
batter
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
spiciness
a
little
cracked
black
pepper
some
light
peachy
fruitiness
nice
even
flowing
mouthfeel
carbonated
to
perfection
lightmedium
bodied
very
nice
beer
overall
the
smokestack
series
was
pretty
impressive
except
for
the
double
wide
glad
i
dropped
the
coin
on
them
except
for
the
double
wide
d
drinks
incredibly
easy
but
a
bit
lighter
taste
than
i
wouldve
preferred
for
a
tripel
excellent
i
wasnt
impressed
by
any
of
the
standard
boulevard
lineup
but
this
is
the
second
wonderful
750
ive
had
from
them
jimi
is
an
awesome
trader
cheers
this
smokestack
series
beer
is
one
of
the
nicest
surprises
of
the
past
several
months
im
floored
by
the
fact
that
a
brewery
in
kansas
city
mo
is
capable
of
brewing
a
belgianstyle
tripel
that
could
hold
its
head
high
in
the
best
beer
bars
in
brussels
simply
put
boulevard
long
strange
tripel
is
a
home
run
grabbed
a
nice
haul
of
new
goods
from
boulevard
for
the
holiday
weekend
nice
to
see
them
step
it
up
a
notch
and
branch
out
into
the
bigger
beers
love
the
psychedelic
label
as
well
lets
get
to
this
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
huge
2
and
a
half
finger
beautiful
offwhite
head
head
settles
down
in
an
unhurried
fashion
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
behind
while
the
active
carbonation
keeps
things
interesting
for
a
while
smell
is
complex
but
not
as
robust
as
some
of
the
other
tripels
ive
tried
but
has
quite
a
bit
going
on
with
sugar
malts
bananas
oranges
some
yeast
some
sweet
bread
and
a
hint
of
spice
going
on
tastes
creamy
up
front
with
the
alcohol
heat
the
next
thing
i
noticed
not
as
blended
as
i
prefer
in
my
tripels
that
being
said
it
still
tastes
darn
good
with
some
hops
thrown
in
actually
putting
an
edge
on
the
malt
goodness
along
with
creamy
banana
and
spice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
mediumbodied
and
creamy
all
and
all
a
great
tripel
that
will
definitely
be
revisited
in
the
future
kudos
for
boulevard
for
branching
out
and
kicking
butt
on
this
one
well
worth
the
money
dont
pass
this
one
up
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
an
american
made
tripel
can
be
greeted
with
a
loud
pop
upon
prying
out
the
cork
pours
a
nice
clear
copperorange
a
torrid
of
carbonation
in
the
glass
huge
frothy
head
smells
yeasty
rich
sweet
malts
of
light
candied
fruits
subtle
but
noticable
low
aa
hops
on
the
tongue
vibrant
and
alive
yeasty
booziness
strikes
next
the
candied
fruits
follow
up
with
a
grainy
aftertaste
mingling
with
the
fruits
light

750
ml

t7341
this
one
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
a
white
head
on
it
and
it
had
an
audible
fizz
leaves
almost
no
lacing
nice
aroma
if
a
touch
light
for
a
tripel
notes
of
peppery
spices
yeast
and
a
bit
of
breadiness
the
taste
is
also
a
touch
light
for
a
tripel
a
bit
bready
citrus
banana
spicy
notes
nice
drinkability
very
smooth
finish
quite
drinkable
m
bubbly
feel
that
has
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
drinks
fairly
easy
but
the
boozeyness
does
slow
you
down
a
bit
a
solid
tripel
hits
most
of
the
right
notes
but
just
doesnt
really
reach
me
d
this
is
a
nice
version
of
a
tripel
its
the
first
smokestack
beer
that
ive
tried
and
it
is
quite
good
drinkability
the
long
strangly
sweet
tripel
was
just
a
hair
too
sweet
for
me
atlanta
ale
meeting
good
head
on
a
belgian
light
colour
thick
mouthfeel
and
lots
of
malt
quite
yeasty
smooth
taste
yeasty
aroma
and
yeast
in
taste
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
too
sweet
spices
like
corriander
well
suitably
carbonated
not
a
bad
one
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
tripel
very
solid
effort
here
from
this
brewery
and
although
this
is
my
first
experience
with
boulevard
i
hope
its
not
my
last
the
only
thing
i
wanted
to
say
about
this
beer
is
that
trying
a
fresh
tripel
as
opposed
to
one
aged
usually
due
to
shipping
time
is
that
it
shines
a
new
light
on
this
style
for
me
the
brewer
is
belgian
and
i
thought
this
beer
was
very
true
to
style
but
the
freshness
was
what
makes
me
love
it
i
keep
trying
to
keep
one
and
age
it
but
cant
seem
to
stop
myself
from
drinking
it
great
beer
a
big
dissapointment
but
3
out
of
the
4
offerings
were
decent
they
just
whiffed
on
this
one
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
but
slightly
sticky
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
but
sneaks
up
on
you
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
very
enjoyable
indeed
notes
ive
liked
all
the
new
boulevards
that
came
out
recently
but
i
know
im
biased
to
my
local
brewery
a
very
pleasant
easy
to
drink
beer
not
an
inyourface
kind
of
belgian
but
it
has
a
nice
relaxed
belgian
character
much
rounder
fuller
and
softer
than
other
trippels
ive
had
nicely
restrained
phenolic
esters
earthy
spice
and
alcohol
presence
give
way
to
a
silky
maltiness
with
a
supple
bready
biscuity
malt
finish
supported
by
a
lingering
fading
bitterness
great
balance
and
complexity
smokestack
series
is
shaping
up
to
be
pretty
damn
good
d
very
high
for
the
abv
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
some
maybe
spicy
aroma
with
plenty
of
cloves

lots
of
spicy
flavors
from
the

very
apparent
some
fruity
flavors
fairly
dry
very
easy
drinking
nice
beer
on
tap
at
the
blue
monkey
tasty
tripel
but
alcohol
was
a
little
upfront
for
my
tastes

at
9
and

i
was
drinking
at
50

an
insanely
delicious
offering
overall
a
very
good
version
of
a
belgian
tripel
good
mix
of
spices
and
fruit
esters
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
its
a
nice
decent
brew
but
has
a
weird
aroma
and
doesnt
quite
hit
the
echelon
for
me
coriander
doesnt
always
jump
on
my
palate
and
the
licorice
isnt
really
noticeable
if
perhaps
in
some
nice
slick
mouthfeel
but
this
is
still
a
very
decent
tripel
worth
having
the
beer
pours
a
deep
gold
very
large
fluffy
head
that
is
spewing
with
aromatics
the
entire
time
it
was
developing
scents
of
bubblegum
and
lemon
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
come
out
heavily
in
the
head
the
taste
has
notes
of
bubblegum
as
well
strong
malt
and
a
very
good
spice
package
that
is
hard
to
identify
but
notes
are
similar
to
cardamom
there
is
also
a
perceived
sweetness
in
the
beer
although
i
doubt
the
level
of
residual
sugar
is
actually
very
high
exceptional
yeast
notes
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
a
little
light
tasting
for
a
tripel
major
fruit
notes
especially
orange
and
corriander
smooth
mouth
feel
and
smooth
finish
a
seriously
spicy
and
hot
golden
ale
a
bold
and
golden
mouthful
from
the
750
ml
bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
san
diego
061012
from
the
bottle
a
tad
sweet
but
very
flavorful
not
too
much
of
anything
needs
a
reval
as
its
been
a
long
day
overall
it
drinks
really
easy
for
its
abv
so
be
careful
i
polished
off
the
whole
bomber
without
problems
all
in
all
its
a
good
baseline
representation
of
the
tripel
style
it
tastes
great
but
is
otherwise
not
unique
if
thats
your
jam
you
will
like
this
one
but
if
sweet
spicy
belgian
ales
are
not
your
thing
this
one
wont
convince
you
otherwise
there
are
beers
id
buy
over
this
one
but
id
never
turn
this
one
down
if
offered
i
definitely
recommend
giving
it
a
try
i
picked
this
up
in
an
omegang
3pack
at
costco
around
christmas
thick
750
ml
corked
belgian
bottle
poured
into
omegang
glass
that
came
with
the
3pack
what
a
deal
its
a
slightly
hazy
orangehued
golden
ale
with
faily
high
carbonation
and
thus
a
substantial
and
longlasting
head
typical
belgian
aroma
that
conceals
the
spices
really
well
very
nice
honey
and
spice
and
very
well
balanced
the
spice
is
muted
in
the
taste
until
the
beer
begins
to
warm
up
then
the
spice
becomes
apparent
but
never
overwhelms
excellent
mouthfeel
overall
a
super
enjoyable
tripel
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
flavorful
tripel
remarks
delicious
bought
in
a
big
bottle
3
pack
with
ommegang
glass
for
under
10
at
sams
club
what
a
deal
good
tripel
worth
repeating
two
or
three
more
times
this
is
a
really
good
traditional
tripel
that
does
nothing
wrong
highly
recommended
overall
a
fantastic
take
on
the
classic
tripel
style
from
a
favorite
brewer
of
mine
the
shift
up
in
price
for
ommegang
means
im
not
buying
as
much
but
im
glad
i
picked
up
the
holiday
3
pack
for
a
price
im
used
to
o
this
is
a
good
beer
ranks
in
the
upper
middle
of
the
pack
as
far
as
american
tripels
go
it
definitely
goes
in
the
like
column
and
will
come
home
again
overall
awesome
triple
i
dont
know
about
perfection
but
very
nice
and
worth
a
try
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
lots
of
rushing
carbonation
runs
through
the
sunlight
golden
color
of
the
beer
topping
it
is
a
fluffy
head
which
retains
extremely
well
with
a
smell
i
get
the
notes
of
white
pepper
pear
apricot
vague
cream
which
altogether
is
a
delicate
and
pleasing
nose
the
taste
doesnt
let
down
either
proving
to
be
somewhat
spicy
with
grass
orange
apricot
skins
while
overall
delicate
in
taste
it
pairs
well
with
the
airy
bubbly
mouthfeel
and
gives
me
the
impression
that
this
was
brewed
in
belgium
not
midstate
new
york
tripel
perfection
may
be
a
stretch
as
a
name
even
though
this
is
outstanding
perhaps
tripel
outstanding
instead
pours
out
a
little
muddy
amber
in
color
as
in
not
quite
clear
with
a
huge
3
finger
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
that
typical
belgian
yeast
with
bananas
and
cloves
a
nice
little
sweet
smell
from
the
malt
really
makes
the
nose
nice
taste
is
everything
in
the
nose
and
a
little
tiny
bit
boozy
but
this
may
be
a
little
warm
not
40f
probably
50f
really
has
a
nice
crisp
flavor
and
feel
as
swallowed
mouthfeel
is
really
pretty
thick
which
i
like
for
the
style
due
to
all
the
carbonation
overall
another
really
nice
beer
from
ommegang
most
of
them
of
wonderful
the
taste
is
elegant
and
reserved
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
has
plenty
of
bubbles
to
tickle
your
tongue
and
enliven
the
palate
to
all
the
flavors
it
drinks
like
a
charm
a
bit
thin
and
not
too
sweet
with
a
touch
of
dryness
and
a
bit
of
tartness
from
the
fruit
the
grain
is
light
in
the
body
of
the
beer
as
it
warms
and
adds
a
supple
quality
to
the
drink
there
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
that
enhances
the
fruit
sweetness
the
aftertaste
is
long
and
dry
and
this
has
a
mild
spice
and
pepper
finish
that
is
simply
wonderful
spicy
now
and
some
unexpected
breadiness
but
mostly
spice
and
nectary
fruits
banana
pear
and
apricot
with
a
false
coriander
note
a
little
peppery
nectary
body
too
with
a
burning
carbonation
feel
has
a
little
stickiness
i
still
get
some
butteriness
but
it
evolves
into
pomme
flavors
not
bad
tripel
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
flavor
is
great
a
nice
fruity
background
enough
pepper
to
keep
it
interesting
and
a
heavy
dose
of
belgian
yeast
most
of
the
great
tripels
i
have
tried
have
almost
a
cheese
like
flavor
because
of
the
yeast
this
one
qualifies
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
impressive
almost
no
alcohol
presence
nice
and
rich
with
good
spicing
i
would
rank
this
tripel
with
the
very
best
i
have
tried
p
s
this
beer
gets
better
with
age
hold
on
to
it
and
let
it
overall
this
is
a
very
good
experience
i
would
recommend
it
but
i
just
found
out
that
it
was
a
limited
edition
it
is
a
very
good
tripel
o
excellent
tripel
very
deceptively
light
and
crisp
despite
the
heavy
abv
the
taste
elements
are
well
balanced
and
go
together
well
overall
a
solid
tripel
disappointing
only
in
the
relatively
low
carbonation
b
to
b
aroma
is
light
bready
notes
and
hints
of
banana
cloves
pears
light
tart
apples
and
a
touch
of
spice
on
the
edges
clean
very
clean
flavor
that
it
is
very
hard
to
find
really
any
fault
here
in
that
super
clean
with
light
body
and
a
nice
medium
palate
with
hints
of
grain
and
light
fruits
that
seem
to
dance
all
over
the
place
light
bears
and
nice
touches
of
fruit
and
light
spice
smooth
clean
finish
crisp
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
clean
slightly
puckering
finish
sharply
defined
flavors
and
liveliness
on
the
tongue
made
this
an
excellent
pairing
with
spicy
indian
food
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
but
falls
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
spectrum
this
one
poured
out
with
a
really
nice
looking
yellow
gold
color
there
was
a
nice
hazy
to
it
and
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
as
well
the
lacing
was
a
little
sticky
on
this
one
which
was
pretty
nice
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
full
of
yeasty
aromas
and
some
soft
spices
in
the
mix
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
was
a
little
tart
upfront
which
caught
me
off
guard
after
it
warmed
it
got
better
the
spices
cae
out
a
little
more
and
the
sweetness
of
the
grains
did
too
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
soft
and
refreshing
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
tripel
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
pure
white
head
on
top
head
could
be
much
fuller
when
compared
to
some
tripels
i
have
head
very
yeasty
bready
and
earthy
aroma
wise
clean
and
malty
flavor
very
crisp
and
clean
candy
like
sweetnessleaves
a
stickiness
on
the
lips
no
hint
of
the
spices
that
it
says
it
has
on
the
label
very
full
bodied
mouthfeel
dangerously
drinkable
not
overly
complex
as
fas
as
tripels
godamn
enjoyable
for
sure
oa
decent
beer
but
it
did
seem
more
like
the
ommegang
bpa
i
dont
believe
ive
had
a
tripel
before
but
it
seemed
much
lighter
than
their
dubbel
and
quad
though
o
mediocre
ommegang
offering
but
a
good
beer
it
doesnt
taste
at
all
like
a
tripel
much
closer
to
a
bspa
in
my
opinion
but
that
doesnt
affect
the
quality
of
the
beer
drinkable
and
rather
recommended
but
i
wouldve
liked
less
sweetness
and
more
spice
very
nice
tripel
that
gets
better
as
the
session
goes
on
the
alcohol
bite
mellows
and
the
fruit
and
spice
comes
more
forward
not
quite
as
good
as
allagashs
tripel
but
its
almost
there
o
solid
not
particularly
memorable
but
something
you
can
enjoy
drinking
if
you
like
the
style
pours
a
clear
yellowish
orange
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
head
that
sticks
around
for
some
time
smells
of
bananas
figs
apricots
apples
this
is
some
big
time
fruity
stuff
along
with
all
the
fruit
are
some
delicate
hop
scents
and
the
familiar
belgian
style
yeast
strain
banana
yet
again
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
earthy
malts
hops
and
yeast
spice
is
very
abundant
and
a
slight
alcohol
presence
great
in
the
mouth
light

this
is
some
fine
stuff

try
this
sucker
again
fo
sho
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
that
has
ever
essence
from
the
bubbles
racing
up
the
brew
the
overall
feel
is
light
with
a
tart
bitter
finish
that
showcases
the
yeast
and
malt
good
drinkability
this
goes
down
easy
and
mixed
very
well
with
spicy
food
a
very
complicated
and
enjoyable
beer
that
seemed
balanced
in
every
way
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
very
nicely
balanced
and
fit
together
very
well
especially
the
yeast
characteristics
which
feel
like
they
are
at
just
the
right
level
compared
to
the
other
flavors
poured
into

with

o
this
is
a
truly
stellar
beer
very
drinkable
yet
complex
as
most
belgians
should
be
imo
highly
recommend
its
much
cheaper
than
a
belgian
export
and
just
as
good
i
would
purchase
this
reguarly
if
fin

wasnt
cheaper
and
easier
for

to

so
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
very
hoppy
feel
smooth
with
a
nice
bite
of
carbonation
but
not
overpowering
o
always
good
to
have
an
occassional
tripel
this
one
is
borderline
exceptional
these
beers
always
seem
to
hit
me

more
so
than
comparable

or

ales
overall

a

over

years
and
many
more
in
the
future
nice
belgian

beer
readily

could
be

i
was
not
too
impressed
with
their
black

style
stout
but
this
one
hits
the
mark
id
buy
a
case
and
enjoy
a
well
made
tripel
from
maine
overall
its
good
for
sure
though
id
like
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
alcohol
id
drink
this
any
time
it
was
handed
to
me
but
id
like
to
try
some
other
tripels
soon
for
comparison
na
na
na
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
from
an
allagash
product

mouthfeel
was
very
thick

usually
expect
from
a
tripel

i
have
rated
allagash
highly
on

occasion
this
is
no
exception
perhaps
my
favorite
allagash
yet
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
very
fizzy

the
smell
is
full
of
belgian

allagash
has
always
been
outstanding
at
emulating
the
essence
of
styles

tripel

is
one
of
the
rare

with

this

with

it
doesnt

sweet
at
all
faithful
to

maybe
a
bit
bitter
which
is
welcomed
this
is
sure
an
elegant
and
flawless
tripel
that
has
nothing
to
lose
to
its
belgian
top
counterparties
recommendable
o
an
excellent
american
representation
of
a
tripel
there
was
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
but
this
was
not
necessarily
unwelcome
allagash
really
shows
that
they
can
take
on
the
belgians
at
their
own
game
with
their
tripel
my
wife
and
i
both
thought
there
was
a
bad
beer
smell
not
skunked
but
like
a
lower
end
beer
we
also
both
experienced
an
unpleasant
especially
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingered
after
a
smooth
beginning
it
is
possible
that
we
got
a
bad
batch
so
we
will
definitely
try
again
however
if
this
is
the
product
in
all
its
glory
the
dubbel
is
much
better
o
solid
beer
would
be
happy
to
drink
in
just
about
any
situation
pretty
fantastic
o
worth
a
quaff
if
you
can
find
it
o
this
was
my
first
tripel
i
liked
it
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
but
i
wanted
more
fruit
tones
ill
have
to
try
some
european
variations
for
comparison
but
overall
a
nice
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
overall
a
good
example
of
an
americanbrewed
belgian
tripel
not
quite
up
to
par
with
the
european
originals
but
a
pleasant
experience
nevertheless
i
found
this
for
9
and
it
was
well
worth
it
i
actually
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
20
curieux
which
im
hoping
will
taste
this
good
in
a
year
the
flavor
and
feel
stand
out
on
a
solid
and
enjoyable
triple
really
delicious
creamy
take
on
a
tripel
it
pours
gorgeous
and
has
an
everlasting
creamy
tan
head
the
nose
is
incredibly
yeasty
and
doughy
and
spicy
with
lots
of
floral
sweetness
that
shows
up
in
the
taste
along
with
citrus
and
baking
spices
creamy
palate
medium
bodied
nearly
perfect
mmmm
o
overall
very
good
but
it
doesnt
quite
reach
the
upper
echelon
of
the
style
great
ester
character
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
noticeable
not
as
light
as
some
examples
m
big
smooth
buttery
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
seem
as
sharp
and
dry
as
most
strong
belgians
overall
a
great
mix
of
fruit
and
spice
the
booze
is
well
hidden
and
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
a
great
tripel
worthy
of
its
high
ratings
o
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
a
tripel
and
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
though
i
would
recommend
slowly
sipping
on
it
as
it
can
easily
sneak
up
on
you
with
the
alcohol
being
very
well
hidden
definitely
a
recommended
beer
for
the
style
overall
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
ever
tried
really
look
forward
to
trying
future
batches
of
this
one
to
see
if
and

overall
an

balanced

o
great
tripel
was
not
my
favorite
style
at
first
but
beers
like
chimay
tripel
and
this
one
have
really
changed
my
mind
o
a
good
american
version
of
the
style
with
its
nice
complexity
and
solid
overall
taste
alcohol
is
not
overdone
and
this
beer
is
worth
repeating
not
my
favorite
from
allagash
i
actually
put
it
away
in
favor
of
a
dales
pale
for
my
dinner
and
saved
it
as
an
after
dinner
beer
o
nice
and
fruity
but
not
quite
complex
enough
not
buyingdrinking
this
one
again
one
of
my
favorites
updated
my
review
to
reflect
that
od
a
nice
tripel
a
bit
spicy
for
me
but
it
worked
nonetheless
quite
pleasant
o
i
want
to
like
this
but
as
i
get
closer
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
find
that
its
really
not
for
me
the
mouthfeel
in
particular
was
a
major
letdown
particularly
considering
how
absolutely
gorgeous
this
beer
is
o
an
excellent
tripel
not
the
best
not
the
worst
but
damn
good
pours
a
nice
blonde
with
gold
with
a
lasting
thick
head
with
excellent
lacing
the
nose
is
a
little
flat
not
bringing
out
many
phenols
but
malt
is
detected
not
an
amazing
beer
just
kind
of
ok
the
taste
is
flat
and
watery
as
well
no
beer
flaws
present
just
unsure
of
the
beer
itself
o
this
is
a
very
solid
tripel
honestly
with
many
murican
made
belgian
styles
theres
something
maybe
subtle
maybe
shameless
but
its
there
that
tells
me
yep
this
is
as
murican
as
apple
pie
and
obesity
but
with
this
id
swear
its
as
belgian
as
french
fries
if
served
to
me
blindly
its
balanced
delicate
and
easy
to
drink
thats
enough
for
me
o
smooth
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
easily
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
maybe
the
best
just
realized
today
that
i
had
never
had
this
so
i
went
and
got
one
sure
glad
i
did
overallnice
job
allagash
getting
the
essence
of
the
tripel
to
me
the
pinnacle
of
trappist
brews
maybe
not
as
springy
as
the
stuff
ive
had
while
living
in
belgiumbut
hey
for
an
american
brewery
cant
beat
this
tripel
and
its
price
very
difficult
not
to
include
this
as
one
of
the
best
o
allagash
has
created
a
great
american
tripel
it
is
not
overly
sweet
a
go
to
beer
this
is
perhaps
my
favorite
allagash
offering
after
living
in
belgium
for
some
time
i
became
a
bit
tired
of
the
standard
tripel
flavors
this
one
has
gotten
me
back
on
the
wagon
because
it
is
so
damn
refreshing
very
nice
light
and
drinkable
tripel
o
allagash
has
proven
once
again
why
theyre
always
on
the
tips
of
peoples
tongues
during
the
conversation
of
best
us
breweries
allagash
tripel
is
quite
frankly
unlike
anything
ive
ever
drank
before
profoundly
aromatic
a
flavor
that
challenges
the
drinker
to
find
a
word
other
than
perfect
to
describe
it
and
a
mouthfeel
to
match
this
has
become
my
goto
brew
for
the
style
youd
be
smart
to
make
it
yours
as
well
this
is
a
good
brew
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
is
tasty
well
balanced
for
9
0
brew
with
the
alcohol
well

the
taste

quite

light
medium

a

a
slight
maltiness

a

finish
coupled
with
an
afterglow
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
o
ubiquitous
allagash
triple
brewed
in
my
home
town
at
all
the
stores
i
frequent
but
i
always
pass
it
over
i
will
stop
making
thats
silly
mistake
this
is
one
of
the
best
triples
i
have
had
from
my
experience
the
style
generally
is
more
try
and
more
attenuated
this
is
sweeter
huge
flavors
and
the
just
delicous
o
quite
a
strong
offering
although
it
likely
wont
blow
your
socks
off
in
any
way

like
it
but
that
about
it
and
honestly
for
the
price
theres
much
better
out
there
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
split
it
with
a
buddy
and
youre
good
salud
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
i
have
handed
off
literally
dozens
if
not
hundreds
of
samples
of
this
to
friends
and
family
over
the
years
and
never
ever
had
anyone
say
meh
not
my
thing
everyone
loves
this
beer
and
im
more
than
glad
to
share
it
its
what
bas
do
o
not
as
complex
as
the
nose
indicated
its
a
little
boozy
but
its
still
well
made
and
does
have
nice
flavors
behind
the
initial
booze
hit
it
does
have
a
nice
sweet
to
spice
ration
more
sweet
and
it
finishes
with
just
the
right
amount
of
dryness
poured
into
a
pint
glass
o
a
very
nicely
done
americanbrewed
tripel
that
covers
the
style
well
very
comparable
to
a
lot
of
belgianbrewed
tripels
which
is
tough
to
do
for
the
most
part
it
is
well
priced
in
comparison
to
imports
and
stands
up
well
recommended
if
youre
into
the
style
or
belgians
in
general
overall
really
good
example
of
an
abbey
still
triple
i
like
it
a
lot
really
worth
the
price
its
been
too
long
i
used
to
indulge
in
this
particular
beer
by
the
pitcherful
with
good
friends
at
my
local
pub
before
allagash
got
chased
from
the
market
or
pulled
out
whichever
the
case
good
memories
pollenate
with
every
sip
a
worthwhile
piece
of
drink

remarks
excellent
beer
overall
gets
better
as
it
warms
in
the
future
when
setting
up
trades
i
am
going
to
ask
for
all
of
the
beers
from
each
brewery
we
trade
for
i
did
that
with
allagash
by
accident
i
think
with
the
trade
that
i
did
with
erick
we
did
that
with
the
lost
abbey
beers
not
sure
anyway
the
allagash
tripel
is
great
sheryl
liked
it
too
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
belgianstyle
tripel
from
a
great
brewing
company
cheers
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
creamy
in
a
light
to
medium
body
the
spiciness
translate
to
a
nip
in
the
feel
carbonation
reaches
that
balance
of
making
it
creamy
smooth
willing
foaming
too
much
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
prefer
la
fin
du
monde
with
its
complexity
but
this
is
quite
interesting
with
the
tons
of
banana
in
the
flavor
highly
recommended
if
the
traditional
belgian
tripels
are
too
vinous
or
dry
overall
nice
an
american
version
of
belgian
tripel
that
is
done
well
allagash
continues
to
make
belgian
beers
very
well
for
being
in
portland
maine
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
many
of
hte
beers
i
had
while
actually
in
belgium
so
well
done
guys
that
being
said
it
does
get

not
my
favorite
though
it
is
a
wonderfully
crisp
memorial
day
eve
and
i
am
enjoying
this
straight
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
a
glass
i
remember
why
i
love
this
beer
in
the
fall
because
it
has
many
of
the
same
characteristics
as
a
pumpkin
ale
many
strong
sweet
notes
with
an
easy
taste
to
begin
and
a
sweet
smooth
finish
enjoy
this
one
very
much
and
bought
it
on
a
whim
overall
nice
not
my
favorite
but
among
the
best
readily
available
tripels
very
approachable
and
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
o
overall
a
solid
beer
from
allagash
great
flavors
coming
out
with
each
sip
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
presence
for
me
though
ill
stick
to
the
white
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
somewhat
disappointing
as
i
am
a
fan
of
allagash
and
i
love
belgian
style
ales
this
one
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
it
was
certainly
still
worthy
of
a
drink
but
with
tripels
like
la
fin
du
monde
and
westmalle
nearly
always
available
i
dont
think
i
will
be
picking
this
up
one
again
anytime
soon
overall
too
many
flavors
to
isolate
this
brew

it

is

underrated
i
will
one
day
make
the
hike
back
up
to
portland
me
and
visit
this
respected
brewery
a
tasty
beer
with
enough
going
on
to
keep
me
interested
and
to
make
up
for
the
awful
drive
i
just
endured
very
solid
example

d
a

with

good

a

that
slowly
dies
down
smell
has
kinda
a
farmhousesaison
scent
to
it
with
the
yeasts
and
very
little
funk
im
getting
as
i
swirl
the
beer
and
it
warms
a
bit
i
pick
up
more
zest
and
fruitiness
mostly
pear
and
lemon
definitely
some
peppery
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
how
it
smells
extremely
wellbalanced
with
some
awesome
flavors
the
zest
and
spices
hit
immediately
quickly
followed
by
the
pears
and
lemon
a
lot
of
lemon
on
this
one
then
the
taste
ends
with
the
perfect
amount
of
booziness
i
really
like
how
balanced
this
triple
is
the
mouthfeel
is
how
it
should
be
for
this
style
nice
and
fullbodies
with
some
crisp
bite
to
it
with
solidhigh
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
high
very
nice
tripel
especially
on
draft
odd
take
on
a
tripel
for
me
smell
and
taste
are
unexciting
yet
ok
feel
is
the
same
yet
its
easy
to
drink
because
its
not
very
tripellike
more
like
a
double
witbier
this
beer
is
subtle
and
straight
forward
pleasant
and
unobtrusive
the
tripel
next
door
a
dangerously
easily
drinkable
beer
i
had
no
problem
putting
down
the
whole
double
deuce
and
my
head
is
swimming
loving
it
ill
sleep
well
tonight
and
edit
this
review
tomorrow
for
typos
and
then
ill
start
making
plans
for
a
trip
to
maine
to
sample
at
their
brewery
these
guys
know
their
stuff
notes
there
isnt
much
remarkable
about
this
brew
but
it
is
pretty
pleasing
for
what
it
is
expected
of
a
tripel
a
bit
short
on
the
appearance
and
maybe
missing
some
depth
but
quite
reliable
other
than
that
i
have
to
say
allagash
really
seems
to
know
what
theyre
doing
in
crafting
beers
that
people
like
this
tripel
has
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
threefinger
head
the
balance
is
beautiful
i
tend
to
be
a
hophead
and
this
has
plenty
of
that
but
its
quite
wellbalanced
as
belgian
ales
tend
to
be
i
get
a
lovely
citrusey
pruney
sensation
washing
over
me
as
i
drink
this
i
wish
that
i
were
having
salmon
or
tuna
steak
with
this
or
perhaps
a
nice
codfish
dish
drinkability
750ml
at
nine
percent
abv
make
it
a
sipper
for
me
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
very
strong
and
make
it
a
great
beer
to
drink
this
is
a
very
well
put
together
beer
from
allagash
this
is
a
dangerously
good
brew
given
the
abv
a
great
take
on
the
style
really
good
stuff
i
see
this
beer
and
have
known
about
it
for
so
long
before
i
realized
that
ive
never
actually
tried
it
i
bought
a
750
ml
bottle
and
it
was
quite
good
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
nice
bright
straw
color
with
typical
belgian
carbonation
aroma
is
very
nice
yeast
and
a
sweet
maltiness
flavor
was
also
very
good
ill
buy
this
beer
again
not
sure
what
the
difference
is
between
this
and
the
reserve
bottle
but
this
is
an
exceptional
triple
and
is
a
great
example
of
craft
brewing
at
its
finest
in
the
states
great
job
by
allagash
an
impressive
brewery
an
impressive
beer
this
is
excellent
fresh
or
in
the
bottle

brew
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
and
spices
taste
is
like
the
smell
fruit
spices
slightly
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
brew
this
was
my
first
triple
ale
and
now
i
want
to
try
more
it
was
a
very
unique
beer
that
i
find
very
intriguing
this
beer
paired
nicely
with
beef
d
tasty
beer
good
feel
and
taste
but
there
are
point
to
this
beer
that
just
to
jive
with
me
as
well
as
some
of
the
other
tripels
i
am
familiar
with
worth
seeking
out
certainly
but
any
trappist
tripel
should
get
top
billing
the
9
abv
was
noticeable
not
a
session
beer
more
for
sipping
i
shared
this
beer
with
a
friend
and
after
only
6oz
was
nice
and
warm
we
liked
it
bottom
line
run
dont
walk
to
get
yourself
a
bottle
carbonation
is
light
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
overall
very
enjoyable
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
drinks
well
but
a
tad
bit
harsh
on
the
finish
from
the
alcohol
though
thats
not
contrary
to
the
style
some
more
complex
spices
come
out
as
it
warms
up
and
the
alcohol
harshness
subsides
in
a
quality
brew
the
beer
has
a
good
body
to
it
very
floral
flavor
with
slight
hints
of
other
spices
the
alcohol
presence
is
well
masked
and
theres
a
slight
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
i
really
enjoy
it
i
was
expecting
a
really
good
tripel
for
not
being
straight
out
of
belgium
and
thats
what
it
is
drinkability
overall
this
really
didnt
do
anything
special
for
me
not
really
very
complex
or
interesting
d
a
beer
ive
had
many
times
before
but
somehow
never
reviewed
it
while
i
not
big
on
the
allagash
dubbel
the
tripel
is
something
different
full
defined
flavours
a
little
american
flair
but
predominately
belgian
this
beer
is
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
american
belgianstyle
brewing
and
while
its
not
the
equal
of
st
bernardus
and
the
legendary
westmalle
in
this
style
it
can
certainly
hold
its
own
would
definitely
buy
this
again
drinkability
an
american
version
of
a
classic
style
heavy
on
the
malts
citrusy
i
would
buy
again
m
d
the
attack
is
full
and
round
but
from
the
midpalate
through
the
finish
the
hop
bitterness
dominates
with
a
light
touch
of
caramel
malt
poured
into
snifter
d
a
different
triple
than
most
ive
tried
a
good
beer
overall
but
a
little
different
from
the
style
drinkability
incrediably
drinkable
paired
fantastically
to
with
the
meal
i
was
eating
at
the
time
which
had
a
bit
of
heat
to
it
very
thirst
quenching
and
still
very
complex
a
beer
i
certainly
will
be
seein
more
of
d
overall
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
high
abv
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
alcohol
stands
out
way
too
much
in
this
one
and
takes
away
from
some
of
the
other
flavors
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
d
forget
about
the
fact
that
this
is
a
top
notch
american
tripel
this
can
be
considered
amongst
the
best
in
the
world
a
wonderful
testament
to
the
style
and
one
for
all
others
to
be
measured
against
my
favorite
allagash
offering
to
date
i
cant
wait
to
enjoy
again
and
recommend
to
all
to
close
my
statement
would
be
that
you
can
get
a
much
better
tripel
from
north
america
la
fin
du
monde
and
pretty
much
anything
from
belgium
is
going
to
be
an
order
of
magnitude
better
than
this
westmalle
konings
st
bernardus
chimay
all
of
them
make
tripels
that
define
this
style
and
make
it
great
this
beer
is
a
terrible
attempt
and
i
would
highly
discourage
trying
this
without
hearing
from
the
aforementioned
masters
first
d
this
is
a
treat
it
was
a
lot
of
sugar
by
the
end
and
i
could
feel
the
abv
creeping
up
on
me
drinkability
lovely
just
lovely
the
comparability
to
champagne
with
the
light
tropical
fruit
and
spice
complexities
would
make
this
beer
appealing
to
many
crowds
i
imagine
this
beer
being
fantastic
in
late
summer
early
fall
although
frankly
i
could
sip
this
year
round
d
this
is
a
great
belgian
style
very
spicy
and
lots
of
complexity
plus
it
goes
down
quite
easily
for
a
9
brew
it
is
a
decent
attempt
d
if
picking
up
an
empty
glass
twice
means
anything
its
a
good
sipper
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
this
is
a
really
good
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
belgian
yeast
citrus
orange
and
lemon
the
flavor
is
yeast
citrus
fruits
light
alcohol
and
peppery
spices
the
alcohol
mixes
well
with
the
peppery
spices
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
for
such
high
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
amazingly
smooth
both
mouthfeel
and
going
down
really
nice
as
a
sipping
beer
it
ended
up
being
a
bit
heavy
after
i
had
gotten
through
about
75
of
the
23
oz
bottle
i
just
couldnt
have
much
more
if
i
had
to
do
it
again
i
would
share
this
with
somebody
medium
body
very
carbonated
and
easy
to
sip
i
dig
this
american
version
of
a
tripel
taking
into
account
the
abv
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
would
enjoy
trying
again
as
well
as
more
of
this
style
just
got
this
bottle
from
als
of
hampden
the
appearance
is
on
par
with
most
triples
which
is
a
a
cloudy
light
brownish
color
smell
is
kind
of
fruity
and
hard
to
explain
but
good
taste
is
about
average
as
ive
had
better
but
by
no
means
is
it
bad
mouthfeel
is
great
as
it
is
not
overcarbonated
as
some
can
be
drinkability
is
fine
as
its
easy
going
down
cant
really
notice
the
9
abv
overall
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
d
i
enjoyed
this
tripel
but
i
have
had
better
would
buy
again
i
found
it
to
be
deliciously
thick
but
seriously
lacking
in
carbonation
as
others
have
pointed
out
its
also
not
as
dry
as
most
tripels
i
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
slightly
hurts
the
drinkability
but
honestly
i
still
found
drinking
it
enjoyable
and
easy
on
the
stomach
holy
crap
what
a
beer
thats
good
stuff
just
drank
a
bottle
from
total
wine
in
midlo
i
didnt
know
much
about
tripels
but
they
sounded
like
theyd
be
great
bananna
was
in
the
description
at
total
wine
so
i
had
to
buy
it
i
love
banannas
nice
yellowly
haze
to
the
look
great
beery
taste
during
amazing
fruity
finish
again
the
banannas
awesome
drinkability
is
way
up
there
i
could
knock
back
a
bunch
of
these
and
with
a
9
0
abv
thats
a
bit
scary
its
easily
one
of
my
top
beers
now
bring
on
more
tripels
pours
hazy
goldenyellow
perfect
huge
fluffy
white
head
crazy
amount
of
bubbles
floating
about
looks
like
champagne
excellent
lacing
beautiful
beer
smell
is
great
peppery
belgian
yeast
floral
notes
apple
tastes
honey
lemon
apple
yeast
wheat
so
good
alcohol
taste
nowhere
to
be
found
just
makes
a
nice
warm
feeling
in
your
stomach
way
way
too
easy
to
drink
dry
peppery
finish
amazing
better
than
i
remember
good
price
too
allagash
rules
d
despite
the
poor
mouthfeel
this
is
still
moderately
drinkable
for
a
tripel
the
alcohol
burn
is
not
overwhelming
and
i
could
have
a
couple
tulips
a
pretty
decent
tripel
that
could
be
great
with
a
couple
of
changes
such
a
delicious
beer
lots
of
sweetness
marked
with
bitterness
that
finishes
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
very
crisp
and
quite
juicy
and
refreshing
apple
juice
the
stomach
warming
effects
add
a
nice
little
sensation
that
definitely
rounds
out
a
quite
enjoyable
drinking
experience
in
plain
words
the
tripel
is
outstanding
ill
need
to
get
a
corked
bottle
and
age
it
a
bit
and
see
just
how
good
this
one
can
get
the
feel
is
soft
and
mouthcoating
with
a
good
clean
chalky
finish
the
body
is
good
and
full
and
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
for
the
abv
and
body
this
ones
pretty
easy
to
put
down
too
good
brew
d
found
this
near
the
back
of
my
beer
fridge
and
boy
was
i
impressed
in
the
running
for
my
favorite
on
the
style
and
a
steal
at
7
a
750ml
allagash
impresses
again
d
very
drinkable
12
oz
bottle
into
trappist
poured
a
light
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
head
the
initial
nose
was
of
a
general
sweetness
with
a
little
hint
of
pepper
and
citrus
and
as
it
sat
banana
the
flavor
was
at
first
heavily
of
the
spice
but
the
slight
banana
did
develop
in
the
mouth
afterward
the
alcohol
was
well
masked
at
first
but
as
the
glass
went
on
you
could
feel
it
warming
you
up
and
the
sharpness
of
the
alcohol
came
forward
strong
to
the
front
of
the
palate
would
have
been
much
better
had
the
alcohol
stayed
in
the
back
longer
but
this
is
not
terrible
either
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
beer
with
strength
and
substance
to
drink
for
an
evening
big
thick
clinging
head
plenty
of
lacing
straw
colored
golden
orange
nose
is
peppery
with
hints
of
orange
peel
some
banana
and
clove
is
present
too
taste
is
those
same
spicy
peppercorns
and
the
matching
banana
and
clove
from
the
nose
its
kind
of
spicy
like
candied
ginger
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
too
finish
is
try
with
some
heat
and
booziness
all
in
all
not
bad
nothing
id
go
out
of
the
way
to
purchase
again
especially
considering
the
price
point
golden
color
with
a
slight
cloudiness
from
the
yeast
the
head
had
a
thick
white
appearance
the
yeast
presence
is
quite
strong
with
a
bready
aroma
the
yeast
profile
is
also
present
in
the
taste
with
hints
of
banana
the
high
alcohol
content
is
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
due
to
the
balance
with
other
flavors
slight
texture
gives
this
beer
a
nice
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
special
occasion
beer
beer
is
yeasty
in
flavor
medium
to
low
bodied
slightly
bitter
and
drinkability
is
really
high
the
carbonation
does
a
good
job
providing
connectivity
to
the
initial
sweetness
and
the
final
bitterness
d
very
drinkable
but
too
big
and
dry
of
a
beer
to
session
in
my
opinion
d
very
soliddrinking
tripel
with
american
flair
as
allagash
and
breweries
like
ommegang
have
built
their
reputations
upon
at
9
abv
and
with
such
strong
belgian
yeast
and
sugar
flavors
id
reserve
this
one
for
special
occasions
and
for
sharing
with
others
very
tasty
though
and
easily
recommended
for
such
celebratory
services
i
was
taken
aback
by
the
averageness
of
this
beer
dthis
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
damn
i
actually
am
enjoying
this
another
belgian
clone
by
the
guys
who
do
it
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
but
also
has
a
pleasant
density
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
despite
the
high
alcohol
probably
my
second
favorite
tripel
to
date
behind
only
chimay
white
the
drinkability
of
this
one
is
almost
perfect
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
from
giving
it
a
5
is
the
high
abv
not
that
this
a
problem
but
some
people
might
be
turned
off
by
it
i
actually
love
that
this
beer
hides
the
high
abv
remarkably
well
d
hi
etoh
but
i
sure
did
want
another
overall
a
very
good
tripel
that
is
well
made
and
affordable
i
prefer
my
tripels
with
a
bit
more
hop
bite
so
this
was
not
a
favorite
of
mine
i
can
still
appreciate
how
well
its
made
within
the
style
and
for
that
it
gets
high
ratings
allagash
does
a
nice
job
d
a
solid
tripel
which
is
no
less
than
what
i
would
expect
from
allagash
d
ok
beeralcohol
content
at
9
makes
it
a
little
dangerous
if
you
like
it
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
can
share
one
here
and
there
just
an
all
around
good
beer
id
say
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
decent
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
smell
is
a
nice
combination
of
yeast
cloves
apples
and
pale
malt
taste
follows
suit
just
a
solid
tripel
did
catch
a
slight
metallic
character
decent
leafy
hop
bitterness
got
this
one
discounted
because
allagash
is
moving
out
of
indiana
great
deal
mf
is
light
with
decent
carbonation
right
for
a
tripel
really
enjoyable
great
session
refreshing
the
slightly
high
abv
is
effectively
masked
within
this
glass
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
my
only
concern
is
that
the
abv
and
sugarsweetness
would
catch
up
with
you
if
you
arent
careful
its
a
neat
beer
maybe
i
should
have
let
it
sit
for
a
while
the
label
says
it
cellars
well
notes
one
of
the
highest
rated
tripels
my
favorite
style
that
i
waited
until
rating
number
785
to
consume
it
was
worth
the
wait
and
what
a
nice
classic
tripel
that
it
is
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
reasonable
price
too
again
much
better
than
a
same
sized
bottle
of
wine
next
up
is
the
curieux
thanks
casey
drinkability
exceptionally
drinkable
this
beer
is
outstanding
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
helps
the
drinkablity
alot
but
not
enough
to
make
this
super
easy
to
drink
bitterness
and
booziness
make
this
more
of
a
sipper
a
very
well
meade
beer
but
i
think
i
will
find
some
of
their
other
tripels
to
compare
this
is
ok
to
good
nice
beer
but
not
exceptional
drinkability
i
could
have
two
at
most
the
carbonation
is
a
little
overbearing
an
above
average
tripel
tasty
but
not
too
far
out
of
the
ordinary
d
a
real
sipper
for
sure
enjoy
it
with
a
pairing
of
uniekaas
cave
aged
gouda
prosciutto
san
danielle
and
a
crusty
baguette
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
creamy
and
mildly
carbonated
overall
highly
drinkable
as
it
is
balanced
and
the
alcohol
has
no
harsh
overtones
while
i
would
have
preferred
some
more
carbonation
this
beer
was
definitely
an
enjoyable
sipper
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
allagash
as
always
i
remember
my
first
experience
with
allagash
at
a
beer
tasting
at
higgins
armory
in
worcester
ma
one
of
the
other
patrons
of
the
event
asked
the
allagash
brewer
if
their
beer
was
anything
like
blue
moon
the
brewer
then
proceded
to
go
on
a
rant
about
how
blue
moon
was
far
inferior
compared
to
their
beer
got
to
say
i
agree
with
them
thanks
to
sstackho
for
sharing
d
good
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
given
its
mildness
drinkability
an
excellent
tripel
that
could
go
even
longer
in
the
cellar
lots
of
flavor
complexity
and
spiciness
would
pair
well
with
lots
of
foods
dr
it
certainly
goes
down
easily
but
there
are
many
other
beers
id
rather
have
the
taste
is
very
light
and
uninspiring
there
is
not
much
flavor
hit
except
some
flowery
malts
mouthfeel
is
light
but
its
very
drinkable
d
a
very
good
tripel
from
allagash
although
i
hesitate
to
call
it
great
surprisingly
dry
and
bitter
for
the
style
not
in
a
bad
way
but
its
definitely
a
little
different
well
brewed
and
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
i
mean
its
just
great
i
truly
dislike
an
illprepared
tripel
this
one
is
done
right
not
overly
sweet
is
an
important
characteristic
for
me
the
alcohol
is
not
all
that
well
hidden
but
that
doesnt
bother
me
too
much
this
is
a
sipper
and
a
sharer
over
all
a
good
brew
d
a
fantastic
ale
but
i
must
admit
not
one
i
would
really
reach
for
unless
i
am
satisfied
w
relaxing
for
at
least
1hr
it
is
not
smooth
as
some
belgians
are
but
is
as
close
as
american
tripels
may
get
very
spicey
and
strong
overall
a
very
good
triple
not
terribly
drinkable
but
also
not
too
harsh
pours
from
the
brown
22oz
bomber
bottle
marked
batch
134
a
stunningly
beautiful
golden
hue
a
cloudy
slightly
orange
color
that
is
almost
too
pretty
to
drink
of
course
the
standard
large
foamy
belgian
head
fills
almost
half
the
tulip
glass
with
a
pillar
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
center
of
the
glass
where
the
stem
meets
the
bowl
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
citrus
fruit
candy
sugar
1st
sip
is
of
sweet
candied
citrus
fruit
orange
lemon
tangerine
peel
honey
followed
by
a
surprisingly
dry
white
winelike
finish
the
citrus
peel
flavor
reappears
on
the
swallow
lingers
tantalizingly
afterwards
there
is
a
champagne
sparkle
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
it
should
almost
be
against
the
law
for
a
9
abv
beer
to
go
down
this
smoothly
easily
overall
wow
wow
wow
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
in
the
beer
world
spicy
flavor
with
a
crackery
crisp
finish
that
definitely
has
some
bitterness
to
it
not
much
sweetness
in
this
tripel
but
it
is
fairly
complex
the
9
abv
is
very
well
hidden
despite
a
drying
effect
on
the
tongue
from
the
alcohol
some
of
the
fruity
esters
make
it
into
the
flavor
and
mingle
with
the
hops
to
provide
some
citrus
peel
flavors
and
for
some
reason
passionfruit
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
ageing
tripels
but
i
think
some
of
the
flavors
might
meld
together
better
with
6
months
to
a
year
on
it
very
good
tripel
and
one
of
the
best
american
renditions
highly
recommended
pours
a
golden
pale
yellow
with
a
slight
one
finger
head
smells
of
light
spices
some
citrus
and
clove
but
nothing
too
overpowering
it
tasted
kind
of
bland
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
but
i
was
left
wanting
something
more
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
was
fairly
easy
drinking
had
it
on
tap
at
the
union
brewhouse
for
allagash
night
poured
a
hazy
lemony
yellow
color
with
absolutely
no
clarity
at
all
a
small
head
to
it
that
fades
very
quickly
far
less
than
average
lacing
smell
is
very
sweet
aroma
of
i
would
guess
tropical
fruits
and
smells
quite
sweet
taste
is
pretty
good
but
a
i
find
many
tripels
to
be
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
this
is
no
exception
has
the
slightest
of
slight
alcohol
taste
to
it
and
you
really
have
to
look
for
it
which
is
impressive
for
being
9
mouthfeel
is
good
no
carbonation
bite
at
all
very
refreshing
to
the
pallet
drinkability
is
above
average
but
again
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
i
think
fans
of
tripels
would
certainly
enjoy
this
thoroughly
pale
yellow
color
and
hazy
the
aroma
is
complex
i
have
a
hard
time
getting
things
some
fruits
pears
the
taste
is
slightly
metallic
some
herbal
notes
too
not
bad
however
there
is
more
complex
and
tasty
tripel
out
there
d
very
nice
tripel
would
definitely
go
back
for
more
good
beer
to
kick
back
a
relax
with
well
as
you
can
see
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
got
this
one
from
the
local
whole
foods
store
it
was
a
batch
138
measuring
at
9
0
its
no
joke
the
smell
was
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
being
very
fruity
but
the
finish
left
a
lil
to
be
desired
for
myself
and
lil
too
long
i
was
expecting
a
better
beer
coming
from
maine
thats
all
overall
good
beer
flavors
could
run
together
better
and
it
was
a
little
hot
but
is
still
the
best
american
tripel
i
have
been
lucky
enough
to
drink
one
of
the
best
belgianstyle
tripels
ive
had
allagash
does
extremely
well
with
this
style
one
of
the
best
nonbelgian
tripels
ive
tasted
drinkability
is
amazingly
easy
for
the
gravity
of
the
beer
real
belgian
brew
citrus
hops
turn
pleasantly
bitter
there
is
a
lovely
creaminess
on
the
palate
i
am
not
getting
the
passion
fruit
but
i
am
getting
the
herbal
quality
coriander
and
a
nice
spicy
kick
it
tastes
a
lot
like
leffe
blond
with
an
american
personality
i
could
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
fruits
yeast
sweet
corn
malt
flavor
of
sweet
tropical
fruits
grapefruit
and
citrus
light
spices
yeast
and
sweet
malt
sweet
but
not
overpowering
light
and
crisp
palate
this
is
super
tasty
very
nice
tripel
over
all
a
very
good
brew
allagash
brewery
should
be
proud
this
was
one
of
my
1st
offerings
in
the
craft
beer
realm
about
seven
years
ago
and
its
always
good
to
go
back
to
where
you
started
from
time
to
time
this
triple
is
no
exception
pours
a
four
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
pale
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
oak
and
dark
fruit

flavor
is

some
orange

at

decent
triple

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
this
is
my
first
taste
of
allagash
beer
nice
stuff
indeed
but
considering
this
is
not
my
first
taste
of
tripel
it
just
comes
off
as
a
little
predictable
world
class
but
not
overly
memorable
or
distinct
does
that
make
sense
drinkability
good
it
embodies
a
fine
line
between
full
flavored
and
relatively
easily
drinkability
despite
the
punchy
9
abv
poured
bottle
of
batch
129
into
a
chimay
glass
immediate
aromas
of
banana
peppers
and
citrus
creamy
white
head
with
decent
retentiion
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
the
beer
definately
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
initially
tasted
some
pepper
candy
sugar
and
some
vanilla
as
it
warmed
up
i
started
getting
the
banana
flavors
mixed
with
some
honey
a
very
good
triple
style
ale
allagash
never
dissapoints
excellent
beer
taste
of
banana
apricot
pear
some
spice
yeast
pineapple
dough
and
malt
ends
a
little
dry
drinkability
a
cross
between
a
weizen
and
mead
interesting
and
tasty
a
pretty
good
beer
one
of
the
better
belgian
style
beers
not
actually
from
belgium
that
ive
had
a
good
one
to
try
very
nice
on
this
moderately
warm
late
spring
evening
d
obviously
a
well
crafted
tripel
more
on
the
dry
and
spicy
end
of
the
spectrum
than
some
of
the
more
pearapple
laden
examples
but
quite
enjoyable
i
prefer
a
little
bit
more
sweetness
and
fruit
in
the
style
but
thankfully
the
medicinal
flavors
were
kept
in
check
d
overall
i
like
this
though
im
thinking
more
and
more
that
this
style
is
not
for
me
if
the
alcohol
is
more
hidden
i
would
give
it
higher
marks
but
the
complexity
is
right
there
with
good
hits
from
the
malt
and
hops
and
yeast

this

mellow

pretty

mouthfeel
was
good
for
the

slightly
coating
drinkability
with
this
was
hard
because
it
went
down
good
but
with
the
high
abv
it
was
hard
to
finish
overall
this
was
good
for
the

there
is
some
additional

perhaps
a
peppery
character
mouthfeel
falls
between
light

with
a
dry

however
theres
a
little
sharpness
not

that
is
a

abrasive
towards
the
back

the
throat
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
tripels
but
this
is
a
great
brew
im
looking
forward
to
exploring
more
from
allagash
future
outlook
this
was
a
very
good
beer
no
doubt
more
accessible
by
both
availability
and
cost
than
other
top
examples
of
the
style
id
be
happy
to
have
this
again
i
didnt
enjoy
drinking
this
much
at
all
and
i
doubt
ill
give
it
another
go
d
oh
yeah
this
is
a
good
one

is

agree
with
the

of
my
original
review
maine
is

greatly
underated

so
faintly

overall
not
a
session
brew
but
i
dont
see
these
gals
lasting
long
in
the
fridge
a
rare
american
made
belgian
that
could
actually
pass
for
a
true
belgian
overall
this
is
a
long
overdue
review
for
a
brew
that
i
enjoy
quite
a
bit
an
excellent
tripel
with
common
flavoring
and
well
hidden
alcohol
highly
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
crisp
and
smooth
easy
drinking
like
a
good
tripel
should
be
a
good
tripel
is
a
scary
beer
to
drink
they
go
down
way
too
easy
for
the
abv
this
is
definitely
a
beer
one
needs
to
be
careful
of
a
decent
domestic
attempt
at
the
style
this
is
a
fine
american
representation
of
a
belgian
tripel
normally
in
my
opinion
knockoffs
like
these
are
a
letdown
but
not
this
one
id
happily
drink
this
beer
again
strong
malt
presence
through
out
but
it
isnt
real
sweet
more
like
an
earthy
yeasty
doppelbock
in
its
malt
presence
slightly
fruity
slightly
spicy
yet
you
really
cant
pick
out
either
aspect
easily
they
blend
very
well
it
gets
a
little
sweet
in
the
middle
but
quickly
drops
off
to
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
which
is
more
than
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
a
little
acetic
throughout
has
a
vinegaric
sourness
that
is
most
prevalent
up
front
but
also
resurfaces
some
at
the
end
mingling
with
the
hops
to
provide
the
aftertaste
that
lasts
crisp
and
a
little
dry
excellent
fresh
mouthfeel
very
clean
compared
to
some
of
the
other
american
interpretations
that
try
doing
all
kinds
of
crazy
things
not
syrupy
or
overly
cloyingmedicinal
in
the
least
a
little
boozey
detracting
some
from
drinkability
i
know
their
wit
is
allagashs
flagship
but
compared
to
this
as
a
balance
between
flavor
and
sessionability
the
alcohol
presence
is
only
a
slight
drawback
to
its
overall
drinkability
a
very
solid
interpretation
of
a
belgian
favorite
notes
allagash
tripel
is
a
real
winner
in
my
book
authentic
belgianstyle
beer
that
satisfied
my
every
wish
with
a
big
fruity
spicy
boozy
concoction
that
danced
the
night
away
on
my
tongue
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
one
highly
recommended
way
too
easy
to
drink
this
tripel
just
cruises
down

after
sip
deliciuos
and
balanced
peppery
spice
with
ample
freah
fruit
and
malt
sweetness
creamy
and
round
in
the
mouth
great
for
the
tripel
flavor
without
the
overwhelming
alcohol
bite
drinkability
is
great
very
refreshing
i
guess
you
cant
get
much
closer
to
belgium
than
maine
carbonation
is
crisp
with
a
creamy
medium
body
really
a
fantastic
tripel
fullon
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
a
strong
luminescent
glow
not
entirely
opaque
the
head
is
strong
on
the
pour
quick
to
dissolve
the
lacing
like
beach
froth
momentarily
deep
before
swiftly
pulling
away
the
nose
has
a
bluntness
to
it
which
shortens
the

as
well
as
orange

the
scents

lacking

no

finish
pacing

flushing
not
fast
but
inevitable
probably
the
best
tripel
ive
tasted
outside

this
is
a
good
triple
but
for
the
same
i
will
go
with
la

deceptively

honey
almost
a
noticeable
tartness

taste
of
this
beer
is
quite
impressive
the
beer
is
not
the
least
bit
heavy
or
cloying
and
the
9
abv
is
well
disguised
the
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
one
that
is
rich
and
smooth
but
also
with
a
touch
of

at
the

a

is
just
a
little
sweet
very
satisfying
ordered
one
this
past
weekend
at

both
world
class
allagash
tripel
is
one
of
the
best
versions
made
by
an
american
brewer
and
the
dubbel
is
no
slouch
either
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
served
in
a
small
glass
due
to
high
abv
which
you
can
sense
on
the
palate
but
i
could
drink
this

notes
of

to
a
fairly
harsh
mouthfeel
i
believe
the
full
bouquet
of
this
fine
brew
is
not
realized
at
lower
temperatures
needs
a
bit
of
warming
for
its
full
character
to
shine
through
deceptively
drinkable
for

0
abv
beer
drinkability
is
hindered
by
the
carbonation
but
otherwise
an
enjoyable
beer
i
really
started
to
appreciate
this
more
and
more
as
i
finished
off
my
first
glass
and
got
into
the
second
at
first
i
was
thinking
that
it
was
nice
but
not
spectacular
but
its
just
so
smooth
and
drinkable
that
its
maybe
the
most
drinkable
tripel
ive
ever
had
i
would
be
very
glad
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
anytime
outstanding
tripel
i
would
seek
this
out
d
another
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
can
hold
its
own
against
belgian
counterparts
never
doubt
a
maine
brew
excellent
beer
pours
cloudy
gold
with
a
billowy
white
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
the
aroma
or
fruits
and
yeast
and
very
sweet
the
taste
is
outstanding
the
malts
and
sugars
really
stand
out
but
dont
overwhelm
each
other
a
very
balanced
beer
that
is
easily
among
the
top
trippels
good
job
by
alagash
in
recreating
a
belgian
classic
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
due
to
the
carbonation
a
very
balanced
american
made
tripel
one
of
the
best
around
not
sticky
sweet
or
heavy
handed
with
alcohol
and
phenols
i
have
always
enjoyed
this
beer
especially
with
a
nice
thanksgiving
dinner
drinkability
a
fantastic
beer
from
allagash
one
of
their
better
brews
in
fact
in
my
opinion
this
one
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
great
tripel
and
of
a
good
beer
and
though
the
abv
is
getting
up
there
9
its
not
stylistically
unacceptable
nor
even
out
of
the
ordinary
and
its
expertly
hidden
i
wasnt
reviewing
when
i
first
had
this
beer
so
im
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
go
back
and
do
so
now
another
very
good
allagash
brew
d
this
is
quite
a
good
tripel
id
certainly
have
another
and
will
seek
this
out
again
one
of
the
best
nonbelgian
tripels
ive
had
batch115
notes
from
72304
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
sometimes
drink
one
of
these
along
with
a
la
fin
du
monde
as
to
compare
and
the
allagash
typically
wins
that
comparison
mostly
from
the
mouth
feel
perspective
as
i
appreciate
the
added
carbonation
and
crispness
that
goes
along
with
it
however
its
always
a
tough
choice
at
the
store
as
the
allagash
costs
a
couple
dollars
more
then
the
la
fin
du
monde
this
is
a
definite
must
try
wish
i
could
have
tried
more
allagash
while
i
had
the
chance
now
theyre
leaving
colorado
oh
well
thats
what
trading
is
for
the
aroma
is
malty
with
plenty
of
yeast
herbal
hops
and
some
fruit
the
appearance
is
deep
golden
with
some
haze
and
a
nice
head
the
flavor
is
very
much
like
imported
abbey
triples
with
the
added
bonus
of
not
being
overpowering
they
do
a
great
job
of
hiding
the
9
abv
it
has
all
the
elements
from
the
aroma
plus
a
nice
dry
finish
the
palate
is
just
about
right
a
well
made
beer
my
only
gripe
would
be
the
tiny
bit
of
latex
grassy
hops
i
am
beginning
to
detect
at
the
end
d
tasty
and
smooth
the
only
limiting
factor
is
the
above
average
alcohol
content
not
too
sweet
as
some
tripels
tend
to
be
but
another
great
beer
from
allagash
i
prefer
the
belgians
karmeliet
is
much
better
in
my
opinion
for
a
tripel
is
highly
drinkable
but
at
9
abv
were
in
oneanddone
country
this
is
my
first
allagash
beer
and
i
want
more
in
my
future
d
notes
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
well
balanced
just
beginning
to
explore
tripels
but
i
think
i
will
have
a
hard
time
topping
this
one
overall
2nd
best
triple
i
have
had
to
date
drinkability
tripels
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
do
respect
them
when
they
are
well
brewed
and
this
is
a
well
brewed
tripel
this
beer
is
not
too
bad
i
liked
it
it
tastes
like
it
has
a
fruity
complex
with
spicey
aromas
it
goes
down
smoothly
with
out
a
boozey
aftertaste
its
a
classy
beer
that
i
wouuld
buy
again
and
its
a
little
cheaper
in
price
than
someof
the
imported
beer
it
tastes
like
drinkability
this
beer
has
renewed
my
fervor
for
beer
after
a
few
disappointing
stouts
world
class
batch
117
golden
color
thats
a
little
lighter
than
expected
big
creamy
white
head
that
coats
the
glass
with
sticky
lacing
head
maintains
a
solid
18
inch
that
is
more
than
the
standard
cap
smell
of
some
citrus
but
mostly
the
sweet
sugary
malt
smell
that
you
would
expect
with
the
style
some
light
pepper
notes
also
show
taste
is
sweetness
that
quickly
gives
way
to
the
spicy
yeast
and
then
the
9
gives
some
burn
mouth
is
somehow
smooth
and
syrupy
at
the
same
time
overall
a
great
sipper
that
warms
you
once
of
the
finest
tripels
ive
ever
had
thanks
to
my
family
for
bringing
this
one
back
from
vacation
in
maine
prost
overall
this
is
a
solid
tripel
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
but
there
are
better
tripels
out
there
worth
a
shot
if
youre
on
a
belgian
kick
a
little
bit
lighter
than
expected
light
orange
straw
color
pretty
clear
some
spotty
lace
smell
is
alcohol
pepper
and
coriander
taste
is
a
bit
earthier
than
the
smell
not
as
sweet
as
expected
alcohol
somewhat
hidden
on
the
palete
or
laced
in
with
the
cane
sugar
not
picking
up
much
fruit
some
citrus
orange
peel
candy
nature
some
earthy
apple
complex
herbal
lingering
aftertaste
very
dry
some
thyme
and
pepper
and
nice
hop
sits
there
in
the
middle
of
the
mouth
the
sweet
lingers
in
the
tips
the
earth
nature
giving
the
hop
a
lingering
rosemary
and
thyme
appeal
a
soft
meaty
finish
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
by
the
end
triples
arent
my
favorite
but
surprisingly
good
for
american
period
3
5
d
good
beer
but
i
prefer
a
little
more
hop
character
a
sipper
that
is
not
to
be
fooled
around
with
golden
honey
hue
with
nice
clingy
crystal
head
floral
aroma
with
some
spice
is
quite
inviting
malt
characteristics
with
sweetness
and
alcoholic
kick
to
end
the
experience
medium
bodied
and
walks
the
line
for
being
a
sipping
beer
but
light
enough
to
enjoy
on
its
own
without
the
accompaniment
of
food
a
champagnelike
beer
that
balances
the
alcohol
well
with
the
fruit
notes
i
found
this
on
tap
it
came
to
me
a
cloudy
dark
blonde
with
thick
foamy
head
and
nice
carbonation
aromas
are
citrus
orange
lemon
yeast
and
slightly
spicy
light
to
medium
bodied
and
fizzy
in
the
mouth
feels
a
little
creamy
the
taste
is
fantastic
fruity
and
mildly
spicy
and
sweet
with
a
little
bitterness
after
the
swallow
very
well
balanced
with
no
single
flavor
jumping
out
i
like
higher
abv
beers
and
i
barely
notice
the
9
alcohol
in
this
one
it
drinks
real
smooth
and
easy
i
will
definitely
be
buying
some
bottles
of
this
its
a
real
nice
beer
experience
allagash
tripel
has
an
incredibly
tight
and
particularly
interesting
flavor
profile
centered
on
the
balance
between
both
moderatelystrong
malt
hop
the
esteryphenolic
flavors
i
associate
with
yeast
contribution
are
the
icing
on
the
cake
and
award
this
brew
an
unnaturally
tasty
medal
from
me
this
beer
is
seriously
good
batch
no
107
pours
a
dark
champagneblonde
with
touches
of
amber
around
the
edges
gentle
haze
massive
sparkling
pearl
head
bubbly
slightly
foamy
but
very
solid
aroma
is
grainy
and
yeasty
with
distant
notes
of
suds
and
spice
carbonation
is
surprisingly
sharp
and
biting
body
is
light
to
medium
flavor
is
dominated
by
honey
and
gentle
malts
banana
followed
by
a
strongly
sudsy
bitter
backing
light
spiciness
throughout
with
a
grassy
sourness
underlying
somewhat
warm
though
not
overbearingly
so
finish
is
dry
and
a
bit
numbing
aftertaste
is
gentle
spicy
and
sour
gleaming
gold
body
and
a
chalk
white
head
with
experienced
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
passion
fruit
and
herbal
spices
palate
says
honey
and
banana
and
then
is
followed
by
a
crisp
warming
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
and
perfectly
carbonated
very
drinkable
it
tasted
perfect
until
i
uncorked
a
karmeliet
next
and
noticed
that
allagash
lacked
the
same
level
of
complexity
and
character
as
its
belgian
counterpart
however
i
dont
want
to
be
misleading
for
an
american
brewery
this
far
exceeded
my
expectations
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
special
tripel
i
usually
trend
towards
darker
more
aggressive
beers
but
decided
to
give
this
one
a
shot
sure
glad
i
did
pours
a
hazy
orange
nice
white
lacey
head
smells
fruity
with
some
yeast
tones
more
like
a
bakery
smell
taste
is
very
nice
smooth
ohh
so
smooth
not
too
sweet
very
flavorful
alcohol
is
well
masked
this
definitely
does
not
taste
like
a
beer
with
9
abv
carbonation
is
perfect
just
the
right
amount
to
add
to
the
experience
my
wife
even
tried
this
one
and
liked
it
she
hates
beer
only
one
she
has
ever
liked
was
some
hefewiezen
we
got
on
draft
at
brick
store
this
beer
did
undergo
an
interesting
transformation
when
i
let
it
warm
up
when
very
cold
it
is
a
much
fruitier
beer
once
warmed
the
fruit
sweetness
was
dulled
a
bit
and
you
could
pick
a
bit
of
the
warmth
brought
on
by
the
alcohol
either
way
this
too
is
a
great
beer
and
a
good
introduction
into
the
land
of
the
belgian
tripel
a
punchy
beast
that
clocks
in
at
9
poured
into
my
glass
with
a
large
foamy
head
liquid
was
a
gorgeous
gold
with
tangerine
highlights
high
marks
in
all
visual
aspects
nice
retention
and
laced
like
ocean
waves
on
a
beach
smells
were
big
and
bold
juicy
pear
spices
ripe
fruits
tastes
were
also
big
and
fruity
figs
apples
pear
dried
apricot
maltiness
is
off
set
by
yeast
and
some
hops
at
the
end
well
balanced
heady
and
drinkable
for
the
style
good
theory
and
excellent
execution
recommended
overall
a
very
drinkable
tripel
very
good
for
the
style
very
enjoyable
wish
i
had
more
wow
great
looking
beer
brillaint
dark
honey
colored
with
an
electric
white
yellow
tinted
large
sticky
head
that
left
excellent
lacing
the
smell
is
full
of
all
kinds
of
fruit
with
some
spice
and
vanilla
as
well
taste
is
again
a
fruit
combo
of
orange
pear
apple
and
maby
peaches
there
is
also
white
peper
and
clove
and
some
other
spicey
aspect
that
i
am
having
a
hard
time
isolating
nice
vanilla
flavor
coming
through
in
the
finish
as
well
this
one
is
a
medium
mouth
feel
with
good
carbination
and
drinkability
that
was
my
first
beer
from
alligash
and
i
am
veyr
happy
that
i
also
purchased
a
bottle
of
the
dubbel
reserve
the
aroma
is
spicy
for
sure
it
is
fruity
and
yeasty
the
taste
is
real
smooth
the
malt
taste
is
finished
by
the
yeasty
spiciness
it
has
a
herbal
essence
to
it
the
abv
doesnt
really
seem
like
it
is
9
so
that
is
real
nice
clarke
overall
a
wonderful
effort
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
overall
one
that
i
would
pick
up
again
what
a
tasty
complex
and
satisfying
brew
pours
a
glowing
goldenyellowy
color
massive
foamy
white
head
fades
slowly
settles
into
14
layer
lots
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
just
explosively
fruity
lots
of
juicy
pear
some
banana
some
lemon
rind
peppery
taste
is
phenomenal
lots
of
the
pear
sweet
honey
slight
lemony
tartness
pepper
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
wow
elegantly
creamy
and
actually
really
refreshing
for
something
this
flavorful
virtually
no
taste
from
the
alcohol
this
may
have
just
upset
my
recentlyposted
top
10
personal
favorites
list
allagash
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
a
musttry
drinkability
very
high
especially
given
its
strength
def
one
of
the
best
tripels
ive
had
from
a
us
brewer
overall
this
is
right
up
there
with
watou
tripel
and
valdieus
one
of
the
best
triples
out
there
and
one
of
the
absolute
best
american
stabs
at
a
belgian
style
in
the
world
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
example
of
a
belgianstyle
tripel
and
holds
its
on
with
the
classics
from
across
the
pond
a
very
good
value
for
the
money
nicely
done
pretty
good
tripel
a
bit
of
a
strange
taste
to
it
but
that
tends
to
go
away
as
it
warms
pretty
damn
good
other
than
that
easily
one
of
the
best
belgian
style
tripels
ive
had
i
was
sad
to
see
the
empty
bottle
not
a
great
fan
of
the
style
but
i
like
this
just
fine
drinkability
very
drinkable
tripel
goes
down
smoothly
and
quite
to
the
style
i
like
it
at
9
this
is
still
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
good
but
not
particularly
great
effort
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
20oz
pint
glass
light
pour
yields
very
little
head
andn
no
lacing
to
speak
of
had
the
river
horse
tripel
last
night
and
did
not
want
to
wait
15
mins
for
head
to
subside
poured
a
nice
light
amber
the
way
a
tripel
should
look
quite
a
bouquet
on
this
one
light
carmel
melons
citrus
and
an
undertone
of
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
get
hints
of
mango
and
passion
fruit
light
sweetness
attributable
to
the
malts
slight
belgian
yeast
notes
of
citrus
and
a
slight
alcohol
presence
ever
so
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
moderately
long
finish
very
nice
mouthfeel
slightly
creamy
without
being
cloying
high
drinkability
for
9
this
is
a
nice
american
version
of
the
style
notes
this
is
how
i
like
my
tripelwell
balancedcreamy
and
the
alcohol
well
hidden
if
you
have
to
do
a
tripel
in
america
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
examples
in
my
opinion
d
it
hides
the
9
alcohol
very
well
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
quite
easy
to
drink
a
nice
american
brewed
belgian
have
you
singn
a
song
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
beers
pouring
at
9
abv
you
can
dink
a
750
ml
bottle
by
yourself
at
leisurely
pace
just
about
any
evening
it
is
golden
yellow
and
slightly
cloudy
with
a
fine
creamy
white
head
that
last
and
last
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
fruity
with
just
the
faintest
scent
of
alcohol
at
the
end
when
you
take
this
beer
in
your
mouth
you
feel
a
nice
medium
to
better
body
that
borders
on
creamy
sweet
and
spicy
up
front
with
a
nice
rounded
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
warming
in
the
finish
if
you
havent
had
this
you
should
and
if
you
have
you
should
probably
pick
up
another
one
just
to
remind
yourself
how
good
it
is
a
fruity
taste
mostly
tropical
yet
mediumbodied
and
smooth
and
the
malts
like
caramel
or
honey
seem
to
round
out
the
sides
some
nice
hops
on
the
backend
for
a
touch
of
dryness
and
feeling
on
the
end
my
review
doesnt
do
it
justice
this
is
a
solid
belgian
triple
and
it
comes
from
an
american
brewer
which
makes
the
brew
even
something
more
to
appreciate
this
follows
the
style
pretty
much
to
a
t
nice
fruity
flavors
and
a
creamy
body
a
very
good
interpretation
by
an
american
brewery
but
not
my
favorite
though
if
tripels
are
your
thing
then
this
is
a
must
try
drinkability
a
good
one
to
share
with
a
friend
but
do
not
feel
it
is
a
session
beer
enjoyable
but
feel
that
better
triples
are
available
my
first
allagash
brew
pours
reddish
orange
with
an
off
white
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
smattering
of
lacing
around
the
snifter
smell
is
complex
and
sublime
with
big
fruits
and
yeast
up
front
with
some
spiciness
and
sweet
malts
surrounding
everything
and
a
bit
of
sourness
in
the
middle
the
robust
maltiness
is
put
in
check
with
some
earthiness
and
a
slight
bitterness
while
some
fruits
candy
sweetness
and
a
biscuity
essence
and
texture
fill
the
palate
the
alcohol
taste
is
nearly
nonexistent
carbonation
is
right
on
complimenting
the
style
this
medium
bodied
yet
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
content
brew
goes
head
to
head
with
the
best
of
em
this
was
tripel
number
2
of
three
for
last
night
definitely
the
best
looking
of
the
three
with
a
nice
yelloworangey
color
cloudy
with
tasty
yeasties
in
the
nose
there
was
a
lot
of
sweetness
pear
apples
a
light
hop
aroma
and
the
smell
of
champagne
after
the
silky
smoothness
crossed
my
tongue
i
was
hit
with
the
sweetness
a
taste
similar
to
honey
as
it
warmed
more
banana
and
cloves
were
presiding
i
had
to
double
check
the
alcohol
on
this
as
i
didnt
think
it
could
possibly
be
as
high
as
9
i
was
quite
pleased
in
this
selection
though
not
my
favorite
drinkability
is
definitly
there
my
glass
was
done
far
quicker
than
i
wanted
it
to
i
found
this
to
be
a
big
tasty
beer
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
clove
belgian
spice
dominates
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
there
are
still
hints
of
earthy
hops
and
mellow
malts
for
my
palate
the
phenols
clove
and
similar
spice
is
a
bit
much
heavy
but
it
didnt
prevent
me
from
finishing
off
the
bottle
i
have
to
at
least
give
it
credit
for
being
complex
in
the
spice
worth
a
try
d
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
the
carbonation
and
spicing
makes
you
slow
down
a
bit
though
good
might
get
a
whole
4pack
soon
allagash
has
done
a
fine
job
with
this
beer
the
only
drawback
has
to
do
with
subpar
carbonation
for
the
style
which
may
only
be
an
issue
with
my
12oz
bottle
absolutely
will
try
again
its
a
light
gold
color
and
is
a
bit
hazy
theres
lots
of
carbonation
and
it
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
white
and
bubbly
head
with
some
good
lacing
to
tag
along
its
aroma
is
a
little
spicy
there
are
some
sweet
fruit
smells
that
come
through
along
with
what
smells
like
banana
bread
and
raisins
it
has
a
crisp
clean
feel
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
it
got
a
medium
to
full
body
that
coats
your
mouth
evenly
and
really
warms
things
up
i
do
taste
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
and
on
the
side
of
my
mouth
its
sweet
but
thats
all
i
can
taste
from
this
is
aftertaste
is
very
pleasing
not
dry
at
all
and
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
it
i
can
easily
enjoy
a
750
of
this
stuff
fantastic
american
made
example
of
the
style
right
up
there
with
the
best
belgian
versions
md
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
very
nice
mouthfeel
drinkablity
is
good
there
could
be
more
taste
but
its
a
decent
beer
pours
with
good
head
explosion
and
settles
to
a
thin
lace
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
yeast
aroma
but
i
know
that
tripels
dont
bring
too
much
still
i
thought
there
could
be
more
taste
is
smooth
and
flavorful
with
those
great
blossom
notes
a
little
cloying
at
the
end
a
pleasant
and
slightly
sharp
tripel
well
done
the
best
tripel
brewed
stateside
i
have
ever
tasted
d
i
really
loved
this
brew
it
was
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
creamy
and
full
of
complex
tastiness
fantastic
im
definitely
going
to
seek
this
out
and
would
highly
recommend
it
d
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
as
for
belgian
tripels
brewed
outside
of
belgium
i
would
say
this
brew
is
second
only
to
unibroues
la
fin
du
mond
definitely
one
of
the
greats
d
very
good
drinkability
refreshing
citrusy
and
extremely
smooth
and
perfect
for
the
summer
time
or
any
time
for
that
matter
the
aroma
gives
lots
of
candied
sugars
and
light
fruits
or
orange
melon
pineapple
and
is
even
more
flavorful
very
juicy
there
is
the
slightest
herbal
hopping
and
the
yeast
is
just
fantastic
its
delicious
the
mouth
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
is
smooth
sweet
soft
and
delicate
just
a
fantastic
beer
smell
was
great
taste
was
great
look
well
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
overall
a
must
have
for
all
tripel
favorites
flavors
of
sour
fruits
and
spices
fairly
standard
for
the
style
though
the
finish
is
quite
dry
and
bitter
alcohol
a
bit
heavy
for
my
liking
750
ml
bottle
25
4
oz
8
31
cents
per
oz
goes
down
easily
drinks
easy
a
little
too
sweet
after
a
half
glass
i
can
feel
my
mouth
starting
to
pucker
a
touch
i
like
it
d
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
allagashs
others
worthwhile
though
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
perfume
and
yeast
with
some
hops
too
it
tasted
super
sweet
like
hops
and
apricot
it
was
smooth
not
too
thick
and
slightly
carbonated
with
an
interesting
sweetbitter
aftertaste
overall
this
seemed
similar
to
the
other
tripels
ive
had
so
im
definitely
starting
to
understand
the
style
unfortunately
its
not
the
style
i
really
prefer
too
sweet
dtaste
is
very
dominated
by
yeast
and
the
for
me
that
cuts
down
the
drinkability
a
nice
beer
but
not
the
most
complex
tripel
a
decent
tripel
this
is
a
great
tripel
i
would
definitely
not
guess
this
was
from
new
york
a
nice
delicate
brew
that
left
me
really
wanting
more
i
had
this
with
a
steak
sandwich
with
sauteed
spinach
a
great
match
for
lunch
this
is
one
fine
tripel
true
to
style
with
a
wonderful
aroma
nice
taste
and
deceiving
drinkability
notes
one
of
the
better
americanmade
tripels
ive
tried
recommended
pairs
well
with
triple
creme
cheese
and
salmon
drinkability
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
not
one
for
quaffing
but
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
enjoyable
even
as
approaching
room
temperaturein
a
lotta
ways
maybe
more
way
too
drinkable
for
styleadmittedly
did
not
expect
to
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
did
for
whatever
reason
i
have
no
idea
but
damn
good
right
here
great
drinkability
for
how
strong
this
beer
is
definitely
the
best
american
tripel
ive
had
and
one
of
the
better
american
attempts
at
a
classic
belgian
style
recommended
an
enjoyable
beer
that
ill
get
again
d
the
crispness
and
mild
carbonation
make
it
very
easy
to
drink
i
realized
the
other
day
that
ive
reviewed
more
triples
than
any
other
style
of
beer
i
guess
thats
why
this
is
that
much
more
disappointing
i
dont
know
i
realized
i
served
this
a
little
cool
and
have
been
letting
it
warm
it
smooths
out
as
it
warms
up
so
maybe
thats
been
my
problemtaste
went
from
a
3
5
to
a
4
5
with
the
addition
of
a
blueberry
taste
maybe
i
need
to
post
this
get
another
batch
serve
it
warmer
i
let
it
sit
out
of
my
fridge
for
5
minutes
and
reevaluate
good
plan
allagash
triple
to
be
continued
poured
into
chalice
a
nice
hazy
golden
yelloworange
color
awesome
carbonation
very
nice
onefinger
plus
creamy
white
head
lots
and
lots
of
creamy
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
slight
citrus
tangy
and
some
spices
the
taste
is
very
nice
maltyyeasty
sligth
sweetness
tangy
with
those
spicyness
the
alcohol
is
present
but
has
a
nice
little
warming
effect
full
body
very
drinkable
not
really
a
big
fan
of
tripels
but
this
one
is
an
exception
nicely
done
allagash
overall
this
is
definitely
the
best
nonbelgian
tripel
ive
ever
had
very
pleasant
probably
as
good
as
any
ive
had
of
this
style
will
definitely
buy
again
i
think
one
bomber
is
enough
for
one
night
so
drinkability
gets
a
4
5
the
flavors
are
very
complex
in
this
older
bottle
more
so
than
a
fresh
one
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
i
dont
go
out
much
so
this
one
hits
the
spot
on
yet
another
cold
night
d
very
enjoyable
one
of
if
not
the
best
tripel
ive
ever
had
notes
drank
this
tripel
the
same
night
as
the
st
bernardus
and
thought
much
less
of
them
then
it
seems
most
people
do
both
of
these
beers
tasted
strongly
of
astringent
so
perhaps
both
bottles
were
stored
incorrectly
and
skunked
or
perhaps
i
hadnt
rinsed
all
the
soap
out
of
my
chalice
or
maybe
my
pallet
is
that
much
more
sensitive
than
most
other
peoples
im
not
sure
you
decide
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
an
excellent
beer
its
light
yet
very
flavorful
doesnt
taste
heavy
at
all
and
does
not
hit
you
with
a
big
blast
of
alcohol
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
sometime
topnotch
stuff
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
could
be
a
bit
lighter
in
body
but
good
otherwise
the
sweetness
is
kept
in
check
on
this
one
making
it
quite
enjoyable
the
beer
sits
in
the
goblet
a
chill
hazed
blonde
smell
is
very
sweet
and
phenolic
with
ripe
fruits
coming
out
of
it
the
taste
is
more
more
of
the
same
but
with
the
trademark
fierce
peppery
taste
to
balance
out
the
sweet
flavors
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
that
begs
to
be
sipped
on
slowly
but
at
the
publick
house
my
glass
of
nectar
looked
like
just
another
good
beer
being
consumed
allegash
tripel
is
a
yellow
color
with
a
tint
of
orange
in
the
body
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
that
results
in
a
frothy
head
pockmarked
by
bubbles
and
a
persistent
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
sweet
malt
quickly
yields
to
tastes
of
peach
apple
and
pear
along
with
some
spice
and
a
bit
of
hopiness
an
earthiness
also
lingers
a
warming
alcohol
presence
completes
the
picture
and
is
welcome
on
a
christmas
2007
day
drinkability
might
be
curtailed
by
the
high
alcohol
content
or
not
im
more
familiar
with
and
thus
more
partial
to
brewery
ommegang
but
allegash
is
right
in
that
prime
territory
of
high
quality
americanmade
belgian
ales
as
well
yeah
this
is
the
stuff
one
of
the
most
drinkable
tripels
ive
come
acrossairy
in
the
mouth
wellconcealed
alcohol
and
a
controlled
sweetness
thats
never
cloying
i
like
their
quadrupel
most
but
id
never
kick
this
one
outta
my
goblet
d
thanks
to
alhrabosky
for
splitting
this
with
me
ill
certainly
be
seeking
more
allagash
in
the
future
many
thanks
to
travis
at
sams
in
downers
grove
for
getting
telling
me
he
had
this
keg
available
im
going
to
enjoy
every
drop
smell
dominated
by
clove
and
banana
taste
was
a
pleasure
with
the
above
smells
on
the
tongue
then
add
in
the
alchohol
and
that
warm
feeling
and
its
the
makings
of
a
very
favorable
tripel
although
im
reviewing
this
now
its
the
3rd
bomber
ive
had
and
will
be
buying
again
really
liking
the
style
a
750
ml
bomber
with
pouring
instructions
and
a
loud
pop
when
uncorking
went
a
long
way
towards
reminding
me
of
the
sampling
occasions
of
several
wonderful
original
tripels
from
belgium
the
body
was
cloudy
yellowish
orange
and
a
lot
of
foam
formed
atop
it
in
the
tulip
the
smell
was
a
tropical
forest
full
of
flowering
trees
the
flavor
contained
banana
oranges
white
pepper
cookie
dough
and
lemon
juice
the
clean
and
majestic
taste
avoided
the
one
flaw
ive
dreaded
in
american
versions
of
the
style
that
of
being
too
sweet
the
dusty
yeasty
dryness
was
quite
welcome
and
refreshing
soothingly
rich
in
the
mouth
and
well
carbonated
so
resounding
burps
abounded
the
label
says
that
this
is
well
suited
for
cellaring
and
it
would
definitely
make
an
interesting
experiment
drinkability
the
2nd
bottle
we
for
thanksgiving
this
was
like
the
night
cap
drink
was
too
sweet
and
like
i
said
drinking
brandy
here
wasnt
that
bad
i
left
some
in
the
glass
and
poured
it
out
presenting
a
strong
competition
for
the
real
tripels
allagashs
offering
provides
a
ridiculously
high
quality
to
price
ratio
and
will
impress
any
beer
lover
out
there
im
not
even
typically
a
fan
of
allagash
but
they
sure
hit
all
the
right
notes
with
this
one
there
arent
that
many
north
american
brewers
that
do
original
belgians
true
justice
but
allagash
pulled
out
all
the
stops
with
their
tripel
reserve
so
many
great
things
to
say
about
this
beer
price
is
right
6
99
for
a
750ml
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
great
appearance
slightly
hazy
honeyish
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
a
pretty
lacing
as
it
goes
nose
is
fruity
green
apple
grape
peach
without
being
overly
so
spicy
corriander
pepper
and
a
hint
of
clove
malty
and
hoppy
taste
exhibits
all
the
same
and
is
well
balanced
the
flavors
seem
to
meld
into
one
new
one
creating
an
exeptional
beer
that
isnt
overboard
nice
medium
full
body
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
long
lasting
dry
and
bitter
finish
that
is
far
from
offensive
had
this
one
tonight
as
an
appertif
and
it
was
a
great
way
to
get
things
rolling
bonus
points
for
being
able
to
hold
its
weight
with
the
best
of
the
authentic
belgian
tripels
gogo
allagash
a
light
but
cloudy
cider
colored
brew
with
a
giant
white
head
and
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
but
suggests
raisins
and
wheat
it
tastes
of
figs
berries
nutmeg
and
a
goodly
amount
of
alcohol
that
warms
as
it
goes
down
it
is
pretty
fizzy
tangy
carbonation
that
brings
out
some
licorice
and
grape
highlights
kind
of
refreshing
but
a
little
strong
to
get
drinking
in
large
quantities
the
feel
is
substantial
a
bubbly
mealy
smooth
concoction
i
could
stand
a
little
less
accent
on
the
alcohol
but
the
flavor
is
impressive
high
quality
stuff
and
definitely
recommended
allagash
does
it
again
its
one
of
those
beers
that
i
should
drink
far
more
often
and
its
surprisingly
affordable
7
bucks
so
im
not
sure
why
i
dont
anything
this
brewery
makes
will
be
fantastic
but
this
one
really
shines
batch
103
cellared
for
about
a
month
after
buying
in
new
jersey
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
longlasting
head
spicy
in
the
mouth
much
better
after
dinner
than
with
it
kept
a
nice
strong
taste
and
good
drinkability
all
the
way
through
the
glass
this
one
is
powerful
not
for
the
squeamish
that
thrills
the
taste
buds
taste
and
bud
in
the
same
sentence
whod
a
thunk
allagash
tripel
is
a
sipping
beer
served
at
room
temperature
in
a
chalice
glass
in
the
end
a
quite
understated
and
champagnelike
tripp
subtle
and
easy
to
drink
and
an
interesting
challenge
to
describe
without
a
doubt
one
of
allagashs
better
midtier
brews
with
none
of
the
faults
of
the
dubb
or
cru
d
incredible
drinkability
fantastic
beer
wish
we
could
get
this
in
new
orleans
d
one
is
going
to
be
enough
for
the
night
because
of
the
tartness
and
acidity
ahh
who
am
i
kidding
i
will
finish
the
bottle
overall
this
beer
is
very
pleasant
it
has
a
lot
of
complexity
its
got
nice
spice
fruit
and
alcohol
that
are
nicely
balanced
this
is
very
well
suited
for
a
sipping
beer
after
dinner
but
its
hard
not
to
drink
it
faster
like
a
regular
micro
beer
pours
a
very
chill
hazed
golden
with
a
bright
white
head
looks
pretty
nice
though
head
doesnt
have
much
retention
smell
was
very
yeastyearthy
the
taste
had
a
nice
balance
between
the
yeast
and
light
malts
and
the
alcohol
along
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
behind
the
earthiness
the
alcohol
was
not
really
noticeable
at
all
compared
to
say
maredsous
10
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
tripel
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
boozy
i
could
sip
on
this
all
day
if
it
werent
for
the
alcohol
the
taste
makes
me
take
tiny
yet
enjoyable
sips
one
of
my
favorites
and
always
a
special
treat
when
my
wife
surprises
me
with
it
pick
up
a
bottle
as
soon
as
you
can
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
with
a
headthat
could
have
been
a
little
more
full
for
the
style
the
smellis
mostly
sweet
orange
juice
some
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
tangy
yeast
taste
was
somewhat
sweetwith
more
of
that
luscious
orange
a
hit
of
candi
sugar
and
a
creamy
tang
on
the
end
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
quite
drinkable
but
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
not
superlative
but
very
good
translucent
yellowish
orange
appearance
with
2
finger
white
head
that
disappears
fairly
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
behind
banana
clove
honey
and
coriander
nose
orange
peel
banana
clove
honey
coriander
notes
with
citric
character
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
warm
alcoholic
taste
that
lingers
very
nice
tasting
triple
for
a
us
brew
i
must
say
very
well
done
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
co2
bite
as
i
feel
about
many
other
belgium
triples
this
has
a
medicore
drinkability
but
i
can
finish
off
a
750ml
bottle
fairly
easily
definitely
worth
a
try
outstanding
and
well
worth
the
money
do
try
this
comment

finally
a
superior
domestic
belgiumstyple
tripple
congrats
to
the
brewersthey
got
it
right
i
have
cleaned
out
my
local
grocery
store
of
this
gem
several
times
batch
83
been
holding
on
to
this
one
for
a
while
several
months
at
least
spun
gold
meets
hazy
peach
in
the
color
with
a
foamy
snowwhite
froth
that
looks
incredibly
sticky
but
actually
doesnt
stay
around
for
that
long
good
solid
sheets
of
lacing
though
a
bouquet
of
fermenting
pineapple
predominates
at
first
with
aromas
of
sprouted
grains
golden
delicious
apple
juice
and
ground
coriander
seed
making
noteworthy
appearances
along
the
way
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
for
me
it
starts
out
fine
enough
with
a
sharp
and
sugary
applepearpineapple
medley
that
merges
into
a
warm
uncooked
bread
dough
character
but
the
finish
just
seems
off
with
a
very
hard
fusel
alcohol
presence
and
a
sustained
earthy
mineral
note
at
the
very
end
tart
and
funkyfruity
burps
pique
my
interest
enough
to
take
further
sips
and
while
the
first
half
of
each
sip
blends
nicely
the
alcoholmineral
edge
remains
every
time
even
if
the
mineral
part
does
soften
slightly
the
overall
angular
harshness
never
completely
goes
away
not
as
crisp
and
dry
or
as
carbonated
for
that
matter
as
i
like
my
tripels
no
slickness
overall
light
on
the
palate
and
never
cloying
i
went
in
expecting
to
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
more
as
im
a
huge
allagash
fan
based
on
other
experiences
ive
had
with
tripels
i
get
the
impression
that
it
is
an
extremely
hard
style
to
brew
im
a
novice
homebrewer
and
im
not
particularly
interested
in
brewing
belgian
styles
but
the
sheer
complexity
that
must
go
into
pulling
off
a
drinkable
example
of
this
style
is
just
too
daunting
for
me
to
even
consider
kudos
to
allagash
for
the
attempt
but
i
think
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
their
offerings
jc
my
first
beer
from
the
far
off
nation
of
maine
this
brew
pours
a
nice
gold
with
a
big
head
that
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
strawberries
kiwi
and
other
tropical
fruits
taste
is
near
perfect
very
sweet
citrus
fruits
and
champagne
like
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
heavy
at
all
wow
an
aplus
brew
from
allagash
im
gonna
have
to
try
their
other
offerings
as
well
a
sipper
no
doubt
but
nice
to
sip
overall
i
love
this
this
is
the
most
expensive
of
a
series
of
three
domestic
tripels
that
i
got
and
it
is
better
than
the
others
is
it
twice
as
good
i
dont
know
but
this
is
a
luxurious
indulgence
to
be
had
whenever
you
feel
like
treating
yourself
well
in
other
words
if
you
see
this
buy
it
especially
if
youve
never
had
it
in
fact
ask
for
it
at
your
local
store
i
saw
this
beer
for
a
long
time
before
i
bought
it
and
the
first
time
i
tried
it
was
on
a
whim
bought
at
a
local
grocery
store
here
in
hillsboro
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
satisfying
pop
from
uncorking
the
bottle
and
the
first
pour
starting
my
tastebuds
salivating
the
head
is
solid
and
holds
through
to
the
end
of
the
glass
and
the
color
is
a
golden
amber
smell
is
light
and
matches
with
the
taste
being
very
smooth
and
rich
probably
could
be
descibed
as
buttery
and
somewhat
fruity
my
opinion
amazing
that
the
9
doesnt
overwhelm
the
flavor
in
the
least
and
in
fact
compliments
it
very
well
this
is
a
sipping
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
by
itself
after
dinner
some
may
dislike
the
amount
of
alcohol
but
i
think
it
fits
the
style
well
overall
a
great
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
allagashs
brews
d
the
alcohol
is
very
present
in
this
brew
not
a
bad
thing
but
it
decreases
the
drinkability
of
it
its
one
that
i
will
probably
have
again
drinkability
a
highly
drinkable
brew
but
its
one
that
ill
probably
share
next
time
its
so
complex
that
it
truly
does
need
to
be
savored
not
that
im
doing
anything
but
sipping
it
currently
but
still
sometimes
its
easier
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
faster
than
youd
like
plus
at
around
i
think
8
or
less
this
is
truly
a
steal
jn
smooth
finish
very
memorable
spicy
flavors
of
corriander
and
all
spice
some
sweetness
up
front
but
the
finish
is
very
dry
despite
alcohol
content
there
is
no
oiliness
to
the
brew
good
body
and
high
carbonation
the
beer
pours
an
impressive
hazy
orange
gold
color
with
excellent
head
retention
and
nice
lacing
on
the
nose
one
gets
an
enticing
aroma
of
oranges
and
honey
almost
a
noticeable
tartness
in
the
aroma
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
quite
impressive
it
has
a
sweet
melon
honey
and
butter
flavor
but
with
some
intriguing
tartness
on
the
mid
palate
the
beer
is
not
the
least
bit
heavy
or
cloying
and
the
9
abv
is
well
disguised
the
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
one
that
is
rich
and
smooth
but
also
with
a
touch
of
drynesshoppiness
at
the
end
an
excellent
beer
from
allagash
pours
clear
gold
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
an
inch
of
creamy
white
head
excellent
aroma
includes
plenty
of
spicy
white
and
black
pepper
notes
herbal
hop
undertones
everything
is
layered
over
a
lemony
alcohol
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
drier
less
overtly
fruity
initial
earthy
yeast
flavor
blends
into
a
lemon
and
orange
peel
center
finish
is
dry
perhaps
a
touch
overloaded
with
hops
somewhat
medicinal
warming
alcohol
lingers
afterwards
the
feel
is
spoton
for
the
style
moderately
substantial
and
creamy
yet
surprisingly
wellcarbonated
and
drinkable
good
job
allagash
drinkability
good
an
enjoyable
tripel
beware
of
the
abv
a
solid
offering
from
allagash
that
has
that
x
factor
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
keep
wanting
more
very
nicely
done
d
not
drinkable
like
drinking
a
doppelbock
infused
with
white
vinegar

out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
left
some
great
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
candi
sugar
juicy
fruit
and
tart
apple
not
too
sweet
of
a
smell
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
then
blends
nicely
to
a
spicy
and
tart
ending
the
candi
sugar
and
tart
apple
stands
out
the
alcohol
finds
its
way
to
the
taste
buds
towards
the
end
this
brew
is
on
more
of
the
tart
side
for
a
tripel
the
feel
is
fizzy
though
finishes
pretty
smooth
a
very
drinkable
tripel
though
a
bit
on
the
tart
side
on
of
the
best
amercian
made
tripels
i
have
had
though
not
quite
as
good
as
the
beligans
overall
recommended
but
not
my
favorite
tripel
however
its
still
quite
tasty
so
go
get
yourself
a
bottle
fantastic
i
served
this
beer
from
a
very
cold
fridge
which
was
a
mistake
pours
a
light
hazy
color
with
about
an
inch
of
white
head
which
lingered
for
a
few
minutes
then
faded
to
a
thick
lacing
my
first
smell
was
that
of
a
really
big
budweiser
as
if
4
budweisers
were
condensed
into
one
taste
brought
the
same
sensation
this
is
when
i
decided
to
let
my
beer
warm
up
a
bit
upon
this
the
nose
revealed
a
honeyed
melon
aroma
backed
with
slight
floral
hops
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
not
quite
as
sweet
as
the
smell
but
more
of
the
same
with
a
slightly
smoother
and
less
alcoholic
taste
than
an
average
triple
this
beer
is
pretty
light
in
the
mouth
but
has
a
big
presence
wouldve
loved
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
if
i
hadnt
shared
it
with
my
friend
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
but
batch
87
on
the
front
of
the
label
pours
a
fairly
clear
deep
gold
with
a
two
finger
head
and
good
lace
smells
of
citrus
and
honey
mixed
with
some
earthy
yeast
and
subtle
hop
floralness
tasting
brings
honey
like
malts
mixed
with
some
citrus
and
yeast
lots
of
phenols
with
a
decent
hop
bitterness
decent
for
a
triple
anyway
somewhat
alcoholic
but
fairly
smooth
a
nice
american
version
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
then
the
abv
creeps
up
on
you
and
smacks
you
around
a
bit
i
sipped
the
full
750ml
over
the
course
of
an
hour
on
a
full
stomach
and
it
didnt
hit
me
too
bad
this
is
another
outstanding
offering
by
allagash
they
hit
the
style
deadon
this
is
batch
75
with
a
careful
pour
around
55
degrees
in
a
new
belgium
globe
glass
the
tripel
poured
a
hazy
orange
with
a
fantastic
head
retention
the
nose
has
a
candy
yet
spicy
balance
the
taste
is
unbelievable
the
9
alcohol
sits
in
the
back
which
helps
to
fill
the
palate
with
a
complex
fruit
sugar
and
earthy
taste
i
cannot
wait
to
go
and
buy
more
from
specs
in
beaumont
thanks
allagash
for
the
best
domestic
tripel
ive
ever
had
v
if
you
havent
tried
this
brew
yet
make
sure
you
do
sometime
during
your
beer
drinking
career
this
is
a
delicious
american
interpretation
of
my
favorite
style
of
belgian
brew
hmm
batch
81
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
canary
yellow
with
a
nice
fluffy
but
not
too
airy
head
the
head
widdles
down
to
a
mere
noticeable
lacing
smells
like
ripe
juicy
fruits
such
as
pears
apricots
and
bananas
almost
like
an
adult
fruit
punch
upon
big
inhales
you
can
get
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
as
well
taste
is
exquisitely
balanced
nice
yeasty
fruit
flavors
similar
to
that
of
the
aroma
hit
the
palate
first
then
a
well
balanced
bit
of
spice
appears
it
seems
to
be
a
splash
of
coriander
and
clove
to
be
expected
but
there
is
also
something
else
in
there
that
i
cannot
figure
out
very
smooth
and
velvety
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
very
pleasant
experience
unknowing
of
the
abv
you
could
easily
drink
lots
of
this
elixir
this
is
simply
a
fantastic
tripel
i
would
think
the
belgians
have
some
competition
on
their
hands
appearance
is
light
amber
in
color
with
a
heavy
white
head
leaving
a
nice
lace
smell
is
clean
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
spice
taste
has
a
good
bite
of
spice
and
carbonation
with
light
alchohol
considering
mouthfeel
and
drinkabily
has
a
creamy
texture
with
spike
that
makes
for
a
balanced
beer
that
goes
down
evenly
making
it
worth
the
spent
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
thick
frothy
off
white
head
that
was
slot
to
diminish
and
left
great
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
fruit
with
some
spice
with
a
nice
yeast
touch
as
well
the
taste
is
strong
on
apple
with
many
other
fruits
present
as
well
just
not
as
strong
there
is
a
slight
yeast
bite
but
nothing
to
harsh
the
beer
has
a
very
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
and
sits
just
under
medium
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
is
also
well
hidden
but
slightly
present
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
quite
possibly
the
best
american
interpretation
of
a
tripel
ive
had
so
far
after
getting
my
tasting
notes
down
i
paired
this
one
with
some
rochefort
cheese
and
a
pear
definitely
a
nice
pairing
the
cheese
really
brought
out
frutiness
and
the
pear
brought
out
the
alcohol
in
a
good
way
matching
the
two
together
with
a
sip
was
fantastic
in
my
view
drinkability
notes
again
i
agree
with
others
its
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
brewed
in
america
in
the
belgian
style
of
its
type
one
of
americas
best
d
this
is
an
amazing
beer
all
flavors
well
blended
and
make
for
a
amazing
complex
flavor
and
very
drinkable
beer
with
martin
sexton
on
the
hifi
the

this
is
a
750ml
bottle
which
is
about
to
be
poured

the
aroma
is
overwhelming
apricot
yeast
and
some

the
color
in
the
glass
is
also
inviting
yellow
whitish
hue
that
is
making
my
mouth
water
the
first
taste
is
is
a
bit
fruity
and
spicy
lots
of
lacing
is
present
and
the
head
is
still
there
too
this
is
not
my
first
tripel
i
tried
my
first
over
a
month
ago
and
it
was
ok
at
9
0
abv
you
better
watch
it
this
made
watching
the
celtics
who
lost
again
can
you
say
lottery
pick
a
joy
i
am
a
allagash
fan
who
will
walk
down
the
allagash
tripel
path
again
cheers
overall
this
is
another
winner
from
allagash
great
tripel
for
a
very
fair
price
this
can
stand
with
some
of
the
best
out
there
allagash
strikes
again
would
have
thought
it
trappist
if
i
couldnt
read
aromas
on
the
pour
are
great
malty
yeasty
spices
with
a
hint
of
burning
alcohol
just
the
way
i
like
a
tripel
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
loads
of
flavor
more
hearty
and
earthy
than
others
and
the
finish
is
not
as
dry
as
its
euro
brothers
loads
of
malt
but
surprisingly
light
bodied
phenolic
characters
somewhat
hide
the
abv
but
if
you
pop
the
cork
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
highly
recommended
d
wouldnt
want
to
have
too
many
in
one
sitting
for
fear
of
getting
used
to
what
this
beer
brings
to
the
table
my
reccomendation
have
two
and
come
back
for
more
in
a
couple
days
a
pretty
true
to
style
offering
if
you
ask
me
allagash
white
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
i
wasnt
let
down
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
golden
with
a
good
bit
of
creamy
white
head
smells
spicy
a
bit
sweet
maybe
some
clove
tastes
great
thick
sweet
complex
im
draining
my
glass
here
to
chase
the
last
bits
it
has
a
bit
of
citrus
and
banana
essence
at
least
how
i
taste
it
almost
like
a
hefeweisen
feels
thick
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
light
spicy
finish
mellow
malt
aftertaste
i
could
drink
this
all
night
or
until
the
9
got
to
me
this
ale
has
a
bit
more
complexity
than
what
ive
coem
to
expect
from
a
triple
tasty
and
interesting
i
would
have
this
again
i
had
higher
hopes
from
this
brewery
and
the
taste
didnt
exactly
live
up
to
itmaybe
im
just
not
used
to
this
flavor
of
beer
its
not
badi
think
its
very
easy
to
get
into
and
its
not
my
favorite
either
its
worth
the
cash
though
had
this
beer
over
new
years
poured
from
750
ml
bottle
to
a
wide
mouth
sniffer
glass
head
retention
was
creamy
but
nominal
light
with
an
orange
tinge
and
cloudy
in
appearance
i
enjoyed
the
fruity
aroma
as
a
first
impression
nicely
spiced
and
the
gop
were
apparent
which
is
what
im
assuming
gave
the
beer
its
spicy
peppery
flavor
i
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
of
other
belgains
better
but
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
have
seen
this
beer
in
stores
before
but
never
bought
it
ill
keep
this
in
mind
next
time
i
want
a
triple
but
dont
want
to
pay
the
extra
few
dollars
that
others
cost
does
not
in
my
opinion
stand
up
to
the
curieux
which
i
think
may
be
the
dominant
choice
in
this
style
served
a
750ml
bottle
in
my
duvel
tulip
appearance
is
a
slightly
hazy
golden
one
with
a
big
frothy
head
aroma
is
not
that
apparent
a
little
malty
a
little
fruity
taste
is
a
relatively
pleasant
although
certainly
not
as
complex
as
many
other
tripels
ive
had
sweet
with
hints
of
spice
phenols
and
yeast
a
drinkable
beer
better
than
some
of
the
previous
unimpressive
offerings
ive
had
from
allagash
considering
the
price
this
beer
is
an
absolute
steal
if
you
see
it
at
your
local
distributor
pick
it
up
if
not
you
might
want
to
consider
shopping
elsewhere
okay
a
bit
of
a
hyperbole
but
you
get
the
idea
a
prickley
feel
on
the
palatea
bit
cloyingsticking
to
the
top
of
the
mouth
goes
down
better
with
every
sipbecoming
more
drinkable
with
each
taste
the
alcohol
takes
away
some
of
the
drinkabilitystill
mouthwatering
and
enjoyable
this
seems
to
be
one
of
those
beers
that
grows
on
you
would
like
to
try
again

excellent
with
all
of
the
character

there
is

i
can
detect

the
overall

one
for

im

i
did

one
of
my
favorite
styles
tripel
fans
belgian
beer
nuts
will
love
this
a
great
interpretation
of
the
tripel
style
this
beer
gives
me
the
feeling
of
autumn
and
i
dont
think
its
just
the
label
playing
a
trick
on
me
this
is
a
beer
to
be
shared
with
some
squirrels
and
deer
at
a
holiday
feast
in
the
forest
yikes
maybe
the
9
is
kicking
in
golden
color
with
a
tint
of
orange
nice
head
consistant
with
most
corked
bottles
slight
fruityspiced
aroma
which
finished
smooth
first
time
trying
a
tripel
and
enjoyed
it
smooth
taste
not
as
flavorful
as
a
belgium
strong
ale
but
very
nice
very
drinkable
an
outstanding
product
my
first
taste
of
allagash
and
not
my
last
definitely
a
beer
for
special
occasions
but
i
will
look
for
it
again
when
im
in
the
eastern
us
and
maybe
bring
back
another
bottle
or
two
batch

the
cork
on
my
750
popped
loudly
as
i
opened
the
bottle
hazed
gold
with
a
bright
white
head
nice
retention
for
a
thinnish
head
and
streaky
lacing
of
fine
bubbles
was
apparent
throughout
plenty
of
spicy
cloves
and
lemony
citrus
in
the
aroma
with
a
mild
creamy
maltiness
nearly
caramel
same
in
the
flavour
but
with
moderate
bitterness
and
a
kiss
of
hops
at
the
mid
spice
is
a
little
more
peppery
and
coriander
towards
the
end
it
finishes
on
the
dry
side
and
with
smooth
alcohol
warmth
generous
creamy
carbonation
and
medium
body
this
is
really
tasty
stuff
its
nice
to
see
us
brewers
doing
such
a
great
job
with
this
style
drinkabitly
of
this
beer
is
very
good
perhaps
a
little
past
its
prime
but
good
nonetheless
d
im
drinking
this
pretty
easy
very
good
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
making
you
want

aftertaste
slightly

a
very
good
approximation
of
a
belgian
tripel
sweet
fruit
presence
is
coupled
with
a
dry
spicy
quality
that
draws
out
the
finish
interesting
how
curieux
which
is
based
on
this
lacks
the
same
flavor
characteristics
kudos
to
allagash
for
a
fine
domestic
tripel

poured
a
hazy

nice

with

tons

had
a
great
malty
sweet
smell
with
honey
in
there
mouthfell
was
good
but
a
little
too
much
carb
however
the
taste
was
perfect
and
by
far
the
best
tripel
ive
had
it
has
9
alcohol
but
it
is
subtle
in
the
taste
and
does
not
overpowerful
like
other
tripels
tend
to
do
excellent
beer
and
highly
recommend

nothing

great
tripel
as
a
big
fan
of
tripels
ive
been
hunting
for
this
one
for
a
long
time
pours
a
translucent
gold
color
that
seems
to
effervesces
forever
head
is
tremendous
if
youre
not
careful
with
the
pour
smell
is
great
very
sweet
with
some
hint
of
spices
traditional
tripel
ones
the
initial
taste
is
a
bit
lacking
with
nothing
developing
until
about
half
way
through
it
but
it
sure
does
explode
when
it
does
again
with
much
sweetness
and
spices
and
just
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
there
is
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
in
the
mouthfeel
for
this
to
be
entirely
perfect
other
than
that
its
a
damn
good
beer
drinkability
the
ale
is
quite
drinkable
and
at
9
that
can
get
dangerous
overall
a
very
good
tripel
its
a
tad
sweet
but
otherwise
quite
a
fine
brew
d
good
stuff
ready
to
have
another
one
9
abv
but
the
alcohol
is
nearly
invisible
one
of
those
great
beers
thats
probably
just
a
little
too
drinkable
for
its
own
good
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
deal
of
this
one
before
you
realize
what
youre
doing
not
a
bad
americanbelgian
ale
the
price
is
right
and
its
highly
drinkable
im
still
a
little
unsure
on
the
flavor
strength
but
it
pairs
well
with
a
poultry
meal
regardless
overall
a
great
spiced
tripel
this
is
a
good
beer
for
sophisticated
summer
chillin
makes
me
want
to
try
more
from
this
style
recommended
the
taste
flowed
long
after
the
first
with
a
malty
flavors
of
chocolate
and
honey
complimented
by
a
slight
citrus
haze
i
read
the
bottle
after
pouring
the
remaining
into
my
glass
and
it
said
it
would
be
good
as
an
aperitif
i
was
not
inclined
to
wait
until
the
cake
was
served
to
finish
the
great
triple
this
is
from
a
750
ml
bottle
batch
41
as
it
says
on
the
front
label
i
purchased
this
from
the
local
giant
eagle
what
a
surprise
to
find
this
beer
there
served
in
a
goblet
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
some
slight
cloudyhazyness
to
it
along
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
there
was
a
lot
of
bubbling
even
a
while
after
the
pour
it
smells
citrusy
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
spicyness
it
tastes
like
lemon
grapefruit
spiced
malt
yeast
and
some
pepper
theres
a
small
alcohol
warmingburn
with
this
beer
too
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
but
theres
too
much
carbonation
in
this
beer
for
my
taste
this
is
a
pretty
good
sipping
beer
id
drink
it
again
and
recommend
this
to
others
however
i
would
drink
this
more
often
if
it
had
less
carbonation

buy
it
again
poured
gently
from
a
nice
750
ml
champagne
bottle
somehow
popping
the
corks
on
these
things
is
satisfying
deep
hazy
gold
so
cloudy
that
i
immediately
thought
wheat
beer
formed
a
fluffy
white
head
but
not
as
aggressive
as
others
of
the
style
the
aroma
is
sweet
a
little
citrusy
and
full
of
bready
yeast
notes
much
as
i
expected
the
flavor
and
body
are
a
pleasant
surprise
in
addition
to
the
subtle
sweet
thickness
theres
enough
heat
to
make
this
a
very
interesting
quaff
fruity
phenolic
and
full
of

highly
recommended
to
those
who
like
a

belgian
experience
thanks
to

for
the
generous
gift
mouthfeel
maybe
only
a

that

with
a

that
really
lingers
smell
is
yeasty
and
slightly
spicy
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
barely
a
hint
of
alcohol
there
is
a
nice
yeasty
flavor
as
well
as
a
dry
powdery
and
slightly
astringent
flavor
there
is
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
as
well
not
too
strong
but
the
hops
are
there
slightly
citrusy
this
was
the
first
belgian
style
beer
i
ever
tried
and
although
it
was
too
much
for
me
a
few
years
back
ive
really
grown
to
appreciate
it
nice
beer
allagash
triple
reserve
is
a
fine
and
tasty
beverage
even
my
macro
drinking
sisterinlaw
and
motherinlaw
enjoyed
it
is

visually
appealing
semicloudy

color

a
white
though
short

slight

on
the
palate
i
like
this
stuff
and
will
get
more
definitely
worthy
of
your
time
purchased
at
sams
on
my
way
to
chapel
hill
for
a
show
at
the
cradle
sometime
around
september
and
cellared
8
or
so
months
since
then
the
bottle
is
marked
batch
69
mouth
strong
malty
and
alcoholic
sweetness
that
warms
the
mouth
through
the
whole
experience
it
starts
with
a
pronounced
carbonated
presence
that
creams
out
and
coats
the
mouth
and
really
accentuates
the
spiciness
of
the
yeast
it
tastes
more
like
a
vanilla
sandwich
cookie
with
peach
or
apricot
notes
than
a
beer
for
as
disappointed
as
i
was
in
the
pour
i
was
really
startled
when
i
tasted
it
this
is
an
amazing
combination
of
blackpepper
spiciness
pitted
fruits
and
malty
sweetness
that
could
be
served
in
the
place
of
custard
as
a
desert
made
in
america
no
way
im
impressed
this
beer
really
got
my
attention
and
made
me
smile
this
is
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
and
probably
my
new
standard
to
which
ill
compare
all
other
triples
this
ones
a
must
all
in
all
a
bit
of
a
surprise
very
balanced
and
very
good
but
not
quite
the
signature
tripel
i
was
expecting
from
allagash
but
still
very
worth
picking
up
if
you
have
the
means
drinkability
up
there
with
my
favorites
in
the
style
sips
easy
but
makes
you
stop
think

enjoy

ive
had
as

than
several

i
made

tripel
reserve
is
without
question
the
best
domestic
tripel
that
ive
ever
had
and
is
second
only
to
tripel
karmeliet
on
my
best
of
style
list
its
yet
another
bright
star
in
the
allagash
firmament
and
is
a
testament
to
their
commitment
to
brew
incomparable
endlessly
fascinating
decidedly
delicious
tremendously
drinkable
beer
anyone
who
doesnt
include
allagash
in
their
top10
breweries
in
america
list
has
a
screw
loose
peel
the
label
off
and
it
may
be
hard
to
convince
me
that
this
tripel
is
brewed
in
the
us
and
not
in
belgium
from
the
style
of
bottle
to
the
cork
to
the
taste
the
beer
poured
honey
colored
and
hazy
with
a
good
size
white
head
it
is
definitely
active
and
effervescent
it
smells
of
bananas
cloves
and
bubble
gum
tastes
are
wheaty
and
sweet
with
spices
as
it
warms
there
is
a
perfuminess
to
the
taste
foloowed
by
a
candied
sweetness
and
a
honey
like
finish
mouthfeel
starts
as
crisp
with
a
alcohol
punch
in
the
finish
and
as
it
warms
it
becomes
more
smooth
and
mellowed
overall
highly
drinkable
and
dangerous
while
i
may
never
turn
down
the
classics
or
a
new
brew
tasting
from
belgium
i
feel
fortunate
to
be
in
new
england
and
have
access
to
such
an
amazing
brewery
no
need
to
worry
about
how
the
beer
was
handled
and
stored
as
it
crosses
the
ocean
the
best
of
the
spirit
of
belgium
brewed
in
maine
by
dedicated
brewers
definitely
recommended
ive
wanted
to
try
this
for
some
time
as
i
love
all
the
allagash
beers
i
can
get
my
hands
on
aroma
was
sweet
and
quite

nice

with
great

this
is
a
nice
crisp
tripel
with
a
fruity
taste
to
match
the
aroma
surprised
that
there
was
very
little
yeast
when
i
emptied
the
bottle
one
can
feel
and
taste
the
alcohol
warmth
overall
a
great
tripel
that
could
get
better
with
a
little
age
on
it
i
got
my
hands
on
a
case
so
i
hope
to
taste
one
of
these
every
six
months

so

the

transporting
back
to
the

i
love
this
has
a

very
reminiscent
of

a
huge
sweet

and
finally
hoppy

the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
with

the

makes
this
a

great
idea
to
label
that
rich
golden
color
but
with
surprisingly
nice
density
very
herbal
hop
aroma
pours
great
with
a
bright
white
head
that
is
dense
like
meringue
flavor
starts
with
a
very
herbal
spice
with
hops
following
finishing
with
a
cidery
tartness
and
slightly
honey
notes
plus
a
warming
alcohol
zing
as
it
breathes
a
bit
the
herbs
and
hops
broaden
and
deepen
and
the
honey
notes
get
richer
not
an
overly
malty
sweetness
also
a
tropical
yeasty
flavor
branches
out
the
mouth
feel
is
quite
velvety
and
syrupy
not
something
expected
based
on
the
light
color
the
head
has
some
nice
activity
but
is
mostly
just
tight
and
dense
overall
a
bit
sweet
but
with
incredible
spicy
depth
and
character
i
think
i
will
buy
another
bottle
to
age
i
think
this
should
be
a
great
beer
to
compare
to
itself
at
a
later
date
ill
have
to
run
right
out
to
get
another
of
the
same
batch
a
750ml
bottle
left
a
lasting
impression
recommended
pours
a
glowing
yelloworange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
left
some
stickage
around
the
sides
of
the
goblet
sweet
malts
and
tropical
fruity
yeast
collide
with
a
hoppierthanmosttripels
type
of
aroma
initailly
sweet
fruity
honeylike
and
almost
cloying
on
the
palate
but
then
aboutfaces
into
a
clovey
phenolic
dry
finish
with
lingering
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
ethanol
healthy
carbonation
keeps
this
high
abv
beer
at
a
level
that
i
could
say
is
modestly
drinkable
lacing
is
good
it
goes
down
smoother
than
some
belgians
of
the
same
strength
truly
better
as
it
warms
to
about
5560
degrees
more
tropical
esters
come
into
play
my
friend
said
it
tasted
like
plastic
i
cannot
eat
plastic
for
religious
reasons
so
i
wouldnt
know
i
think
he
was
picking
up
on

an
excellent

has
its
own

allagash
triple
was
served
from
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
labeled
batch
38
in
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
was
an
attractive
hazed
goldenstraw
color
and
was
blanketed
by
a
white
head
that
left
good
sheet
lacing
the
nose
was
superbly
spiced
with
notes
of
bitterorange
peel
juicy
citrus
fall
leaves
coriander
and
some
nondescript
herbalness
an
awesome
sourtartness
served
as
a
counter
accent
to
the
nutmeg
tinged
maltiness
on
the
palate
an
immediately
spicy
lightly
astringent
applepear
fruit
malt
base
starts
things
off
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
light
musky
coriander
and
orange
juice
a
tart
bitterness
kicked
in
leading
to
the
orangespice
finish
that
left
nice
lingering
orangetinged
spicecoriander
notes
a
bit
of
warming
was
felt
but
no
alcohol
was
detected
this
triple
was
masterfully
balanced
and
possessed
a
wonderful
flow
of
flavor
the
body
was
smooth
and
sort
of
creamy
working
very
well
with
the
flavors
and
character
of
the
beer
allagash
triple
is
an
all
around
excellent
example
of
the
style
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
was
when
rob
tod
came
into
my
store
at
930am
on
a
tuesday
not
one
to
refuse
a
complimentary
beer
i
partook
of
samples
of
his
entire
product
line
even
though
the
rest
of
the
workday
was
a
little
hazy
i
became
quite
enamored
with
this
little
brewery
this
particular
bottle
was
from
batch
37
aged
for
over
a
year
in
my
cellar
er
closet
pours
a
lightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
lovely
white
head
and
a
neverending
flow
of
beautiful
champagne
bubbles
interesting
nose
holds
notes
of
sweet
vanilla
light
fruit
and
lightly
spicy
yeast
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
light
astringency
on
the
palate
with
notes
of
fruit
yeast
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
touch
touch
of
foam
high
alcohol
makes
it
a
bit
tough
to
drink
more
than
a
glass
though
great
drinkability
added
to
my
normal
duvel
and
hennepin
light
belgians
that
i
drink
all
the
time
slot
i
liked
the
way
this
beer
looked
the
pale
amber
color
of
the
beer
made
it
almost
too
good
to
drink
the
pour
as
without
any
head
and
no
lace
formed
around
the
glass
as
i
drank
the
flavor
was
pretty
fruity
it
had
strong
tones
of
apple
cider
and
almost
a
wheat
taste
the
hops
while
very
much
present
were
not
enough
to
take
away
from
the
sweetness
of
the
apple
taste
the
alcohol
was
also
very
noticeable
on
the
tongue
oelergud
absolutely
stunning
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
dry
pale
malt
scent
with
a
slight
fruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
pale
malt
flavor
with
dry
yet
fruity
belgian
yeast
finish
it
goes
down
easy
and
warms
with
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
tripel
but
ive
had
better
it
lacks
a
little
spice
and
fruitiness
its
a
little
too
dry
for
me
batch
36
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
the
cork
was
a
biotch
to
get
out
the
only
mushroom
cork
ive
ever
had
to
take
a
corkscrew
to
but
its
well
worth
the
effort
anyways
it
pours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
color
with
three
fingers
of
head
there
is
sticky
lacing
left
all
over
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
fruity
with
bartlett
pear
granny
smith
apple
and
white
grapes
a
little
bit
of
peppery
spice
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
at
first
with
more
fruit
coming
through
and
bits
of
honey
and
sugar
a
slightly
tart
and
spicy
finish
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
superbly
thick
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
great
too
for
a
9
brew
yet
another
great
offering
from
allagash
the
first
careful
pour
from
a
longstanding
bottle
delivers
a
crystalclear
goldenorange
and
yellow
body
that
teems
with
fine
effervescent
bubbles
beneath
a
two
inch
head
of
densely
creamy
white
froth
the
head
retention
is
excellent
and
it
maintains
a
solid
quarter
inch
of
cream
as
well
as
leaving
almost
completely
solid
walls
of
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
delivers
a
sweetish
candy
laced
malt
thats
brightened
with
a
touch
of
orange
melon
and
perhaps
vanilla
amidst
a
sprinkling
of
coriander
in
the
mouth
its
tiny
bubbles
foamup
on
the
tongue
giving
a
little
tingle
before
it
becomes
pillowy
soft
and
lightly
creamy
the
flavor
expresses
what
the
nose
suggests
but
with
more
ferver
its
vanilla
is
much
clearer
than
the
nose
suggests
and
its
delicately
citrusy
orange
character
balances
the
candy
and
vanilla
alongside
a
sublime
spiciness
of
coriander
and
white
pepper
its
bitterness
is
well
heeled
and
its
superbly
balanced
for
the
style
particularily
given
its
9
alcohol
which
never
fully
shows
an
astounding
beer
thats
rich
without
being
bold
enough
to
hinder
its
drinkability
and
complex
enough
to
remain
interesting
throughout
several
glasses
additionally
this
is
well
worth
stocking
up
on
as
it
should
appeal
to
a
wide
variety
of
guests
in
your
home
and
works
equally
well
during
a
cool
summer
evening
on
the
back
porch
as
it
does
during
the
holiday
season
very
creamy
pour
with
cream

a
long
and

aftertaste

a
curious
combination
had
to
finish
the
bomber
after
lunch
rye
grain
i
could
sip
on
this
nectar
all
night
long
after
uncorking
this
beauty
i
was
hit
by
a
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
fruitiness
it
poured
out
a
pale
golden
color
with
creamy
white
head
the
flavor
was
much
more
dry
and
malty
than
i
expected
it
to
be
and
it
went
down
with
a
creamy
yet
tingling
body
afterwards
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
became
noticeable
on
the
palate
but
not
so
much
as
to
detract
from
the
experience
drinkability
go
slow
or
it
will
catch
up
with
you
in
a
hurry
it
is
a
slight
cloudy
golden
in
color
with
a
big
head
it
has
a
big
hoppy
aroma
with
some
citrus
notes
it
is
medium
bodied
with
sweet
maltiness
and
corriander
is
evident
there
are
some
spicy
phenols
as
well
it
finishes
too
wet
for
lack
of
a
better
term
it
should
finish
a
little
drier
and
be
a
little
more
spicy
this
beer
has
a
dry
grassy
yeasty
musty
bready
aroma
the
aroma
is
quite
complex
and
perfect
for
a
tripel
the
beer
is
brilliantly
clear
a
bright
gold
color
with
a
dense
meringue
like
white
head
that
is
held
up
by
a
prodigious
carbonation
the
taste
is
sharp
astringent
lightly
sweet
a
bit
of
grain
herbal
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
this
is
a
great
interpretation
by
allagash
this
beer
has
lots
of
flavor
unlike
the
breweries
dubbel
this
beer
is
so
effervescent
that
it
has
quite
a
drying
effect
this
beer
has
completely
restored
my
faith
in
allagash
they
can
make
some
tasty
brew
from
a
750
ml
bottle
labeled
as
batch
40
poured
into
a
glass
this
wonderful
beer
presented
itself
cloudy
orange
with
a
white
head
observing
the
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
is
a
thing
of
beauty
smell
was
very
citric
but
well
balanced
with
an
aroma
of
spice
present
as
well
this
being
my
first
tripel
i
am
perplexed
by
the
spicy
fruitiness
of
this
beer
at
first
the
beer
had
strong
apricot
notes
but
quickly
gave
way
to
a
pleasant
belgian
strong
pale
ale
type
spiciness
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
beer
but
at
9
you
can
definitely
feel
the
effects
before
finishing
the
750
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
bubbly
this
is
certainly
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
available
at
all
times
this
assertive
maine
product
fills
the
palate
without
overwhelming
the
flavors
glide
about
and
coexist
in
a
tantalizing
balance
many
beers
have
a
lot
of
one
thing
but
this
one
has
just
enough
of
each
thing
you
sip
and
sip
hardly
noticing
how
much
youve
had
but
the
abv
wont
forget
to
remind
you
before
too
long
still
you
cant
help
but
enjoy
every
drop
in
one
big
bottle
its
a
happy
person
who
has
allagash
available
in
hisher
neck
of
the
woods
i
know
i
am
this
beer
could
be
excellent
and
would
be
a
great
drinking
beer
if
the
flavor
was
more
pronounced
i
would
try
it
again
to
give
it
another
chance

a

after
taste

the
nose
would
suggest
but
this
one
really
plays
games
with
my
tastebuds
one
moment
im
tasting
pine
and
citrusy
hops
then
suddenly
its
caramel
and
toffee
malts
this
one
is
really
a
fun
experience
to
savor
the
multiplicity
of
tastes
come
together
so
extremely
well
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
damn
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
these
stored
in
my
basement
cellar
i
can
only
dream
of
how
well
this
stuff
will
age
a
year
or
two
down
the
road
alcohol
warmth
from
the
high
abv
is
quite
welcome
on

very
cold
winter
evening
wow
the
folks
at
allagash
have
some
great
ales
on
the
market
and
this
is
certainly
one
of
their
best
pours
golled
yellow
nice
fluffy

yeast
and
fruit
in

nose
another
winner
from
allagash
well

at

i
want
to
track
this
one
down
on

sampled
112903
best
trippel
ive
ever
tasted
perfect
to
style
and
wonderfully
delicious
nice
flavor
im
beginning
to
love
the
style
big
flavor
but
very
mellow
and
smooth
starts
out
sweet
and
then
shifts
to
in
onslaught
of
juicy
hops
that
was
almost
overbearing
but
ended
up
being
very
pleasing
lots
of
light
fruits
similar
to
the
aroma
starts
out
with
the
light
fruits
and
then
leads
to
the
sour
ones
on
the
finish
nice
brew
easily
one
of
the
best
tripelstyles
made
in
america
a
very
flowery
candi
sugar
filled
tripel
is
a
great
homage
to
the
great
beers
of
belgium
fantastic
and
one
i
will
have
in
the
future
batch
43
from
a
750
ml
bottle
its
hazy
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
comes
back
to
life
every
time
the
glass
is
swirled
the
smell
is
spicy
with
a
wide
variety
of
fruit
flavors
including
a
bit
of
banana
and
some
green
fruit
like
apple
or
pear
the
taste
is
exceptionally
smooth
with
only
a
hint
of
the
9
abv
although
some
of
the
funky
musty
smells
particular
to
belgians
are
present
the
spice
and
fruit
really
dominate
the
taste
as
for
drinkability
the
750
was
gone
in
no
time
i
hope
to
track
down
more

is
sweet
fruit
notes
are
all
over
bananas
green
grapes
and
herbal
tones
cloves
and
yes
the
passion
fruit
a
slight
musty
yeast
note
is
also
mixed
in
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
as
it
warms
the
tones
seem
to
mellow
but
the
taste
improves
the
flavor
is
of
tropical
fruit
a
slight
malt
back
and
the
fruit
again
is
there
and
the
spices
come
to
play
it
is
sweet
but
not
a
nasty
sweet
more
of
gentle
tones
of
the
fruit
no
wait
it
is
honey
it
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
the
9
0
is
hidden
by
everything
going
on
in
this
beer
this
beer
is
simply
enjoyable
to
drink
another
killer
beer
from
allagash
sweet
estery
aromas
lazily
drift
about
banana
pear
corn
syrup
has
a
little
bit
of
that
aroma
you
get
in
a
building
where
they
make
apple
cider
from
the
mashed
exposed
apples
very
delicate
and
sweet
sensations
continue
to
the
palate
and
are
cleaned
up
with
a
slight
alcoholdriven
bitterness
on
the
finish
nice
i
dont
have
a
large
amount
of
belgians
under
my
belt
at
this
point
maybe
a
dozen
or
so
but
i
can
easily
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
so
far
ill
certainly
be
looking
for
this
one
again
wonderful
brew
that
is
very
drinkable
despite
the
9
0
abv
i
had
no
problem
finishing
off
the
750ml
bottle
with
no
additional
help
imho
not
a
lot
of
character
or
body
numerous
qualities
that
can
work
in
a
well
balanced
beer
were
either
under
or
over
represented
it
looks
as
if
there
have
been
other
batches
of
this
beer
that
have
been
much
better
not
an
everyday
beer
but
hey
its
not
trying
to
be
good
brew
to
stick
in
the
cellar
to
let
it
mellow
a
nice
source
of
warmth
for
winter
an
outstanding
american
version
of
the
belgian
style
notes
very
flavorful
tripel
with
a
nice
body
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
a
decent
head
slowly
disappeared
during
the
sample
the
slight
yeast
floral
and
citrus
aroma
was
very
pleasant
the
triple
was
smooth
with
a
nice
balance
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
mild
yeast
overtone
the
malt
and
citrus
notes
lingered
on
the
tongue
the
alcohol
was
barely
noticable
making
this
very
drinkable
for
the
style
other
i
think
something
might
be
off
with
either
my
bottle
or
the
batch
was
my
bottle
too
young
mayhaps
ill
give
this
one
another
shot
sometime
down
the
road
easy
to
drink
not
overpowering
a
very
respectable
effort
by
an
american
brewery
on
a
belgian
tripel
a
big
creamcolored
coarse
foamy
head
collapses
noisily
it
leaves
clumpy
lacing
as
it
goes
the
color
of
the
beer
is
hazy
gold
a
little
darkish
oh
man
what
a
nice
nose
sweet
spicy
with
bananas
and
butter
the
bananas
and
spice
are
joined
by
some
alcohol
in
the
front
the
middle
turns
fruity
with
some
caramely
malt
its
a
touch
buttery
major
alcohol
appears
in
the
finish
but
theres
lots
of
grains
and
bread
to
fill
in
theres
also
some
nice
hops
and
what
i
can
only
describe
as
pineapple
this
beer
is
awesome
absolutely
great
very
nice
beer
a
bit
of
an
americanized
version
of
a
tripel
with
a
more
agressive
hopping
and
less
overwhelming
sweetness
tasty
but
the
alcohol
content
assures
that
i
can
only
take
a
couple
pints
of
this
stuff
batch
34
the
appearance
was
a
large
sized
white
head
that
consisted
of
finesmall
sized
bubbles
there
was
was
carbonation
observed
with
this
beer
along
with
a
cloudy
body
the
hue
was
yellow
and
the
nose
consisted
of
malt
hops
fruit
and
cloves
the
flavor
was
sour
tart
and
fruity
it
had
bubbly
and
smooth
mouthfeel
along
with
a
medium
body
there
was
virtually
no
lacing
with
this
beer
uncorked
with
a
mild
pop
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
orange
in
color
with
a
thin
though
very
persistent
off
white
top
lots
of
flavors
in
this
beer

grapefruit
coriander
and
some
honeylike
candi
sugar
alcohol
finish
is
a
bit
heavy
and
sweetness
is
not
quite
balanced
by
the
citric
hops
still
perhaps
the
fault
is
mine
i
couldnt
wait
to
drink
this
one
and
i
imagine
it
would
benefit
a
good
deal
from
aging
this
bottle
was
750
mil
batch
42
when
poured
it
was
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
very
little
foam
on
even
less
lace
the
smell
was
of
a
fruity
nature
with
hints
of
malts
the
taste
was
of
fruity
sweersour
maltiness
lively
mouth
feel
with
a
finish
rminiscent
of
brut
champagne
i
would
have
rated
this
beer
higher
but
it
had
just
a
little
to
much
sour
in
the
after
taste
750ml
bottle
batch
35
poured
a
hazy
yellow
gold
with
a
moderate
head
that
didnt
last
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
candy
sweet
with
banana
added
taste
starts
off
sweet
then
the
spice
kicks
in
and
the
alcohol
warmth
the
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
good
sipping
ale
spice
nose
of
corriander
and
pepper
fluffy
white
head
on
the
pour
yellow
colored
with
a
touch
of
gold
color
and
lots
of
little
bubbles
in
the
goblet
initial
sweet
malt
taste
and
this
is
then
cut
by
a
sharp
white
pepper
hop
and
corriander
tastes
the
brew
is
good
it
just
is
too
peppery
for
me
in
the
finish
nice
smooth
mouth
overall
a
high
quality
american
made
belgian
i
give
this
two
pints
way
up
i
was
highly
disappointed
by
this
tripel
maybe
because
it
was
in
the
top
50
beers
i
expected
more
this
belgian
style
ale
came
from
batch
38
it
poured
a
very
cloudy
brown
with
a
fair
head
for
the
style
the
aroma
was
not
very
complex
and
only
a
slight
malt
smell
no
esters
or
cloves
and
no
hops
the
fruitiness
and
cloves
were
absent
in
the
taste
as
well
the
malty
sweetness
was
there
and
might
have
been
offset
by
some
hoppiness
but
not
really
sure
it
did
leave
a
sweet
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
light
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
i
had
to
keep
swirling
it
in
my
duval
glass
to
maintain
head
so
not
to
impressed
the
price
was
good
under
6
00
for
a
750
ml
bottle
but
chimay
is
a
better
value
in
my
book
the
taste
was
true
to
the
smell
it
warmed
the
mouth
and
lingered
well
into
reflection
pours
a
cloudy
orangish
yellow
with
a
small
but
persistent
white
head
carbonation
kicking
nicely
i
smell
buttery
toffee
and
a
mild
alcohol
scent
this
is
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
its
got
a
nice
ripe
fruit
taste
up
front
what
keeps
it
from
being
great
is
the
fact
that
the
taste
seems
to
dissappear
halfway
through
my
sip
leaving
just
carbonation
alcohol
and
a
slightly
buttery
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
helped
out
by
the
carbonation
although
its
slightly
syrupy
there
is
something
lacking
with
this
beer
too
much
fruit
and
not
enough
backbone
although
the
price
is
fair
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
gold
color
and
formed
a
huge
foamy
white
head
that
left
laticed
lace
as
it
slowly
supsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
and
maybe
a
few
particles
of
sediment
an
aroma
of
hops
malt
coriander
and
other
spices
with
a
touch
of
yeast
a
taste
of
malt
coriander
and
grainyeast

has
a

f
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
tripel
style
and
this
is
a
great
one
if
i
had
to
offer
a
single
criticism
and
i
have
to
because
i
havent
found
the
perfect
beer
yet
i
would
say
its
not
as
intensely
flavorful
as
say
la
fin
du
monde
otherwise
this
is
an
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
tripels
to
be
found
anywhere
this
brew
is
solid
proof
that
not
all
the
best
belgianstyle
beers
come
from
belgium
in
other
words
another
winner
from
the
brewers
at
allagash
this
is
a
wonderful
american
example
of
the
style
possibly
a
bit
thinner
than
its
belgian
counterparts
but
also
less
yeasty
a
nice
fruity
taste
emerges
and
gets
better
as
you
go
this
beer
is
quite
a
treat
rates
with
the
best
triples
ive
had
i
will
buy
allagash
any
time
i
have
the
opportunity
allagash
id
tip
my
hat
to
you
but
i
havent
got
a
hat
batch
28
like
allagashs
own
description
this
beer
has
a
subtle
banana
honey
flavors
it
also
has
a
great
nose
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
white
beer
its
cloudy
yellow
w
a
big
white
frothy
head
sit
back
and
sip
this
9
abv
bad
boy
the
allagash
tripel
pours
a
deep
golden
and
gives
a
shavingcream
head
that
had
me
looking
for
a
razor
there
were
hints
of
pear
and
some
spicy
notes
all
of
which
seemed
like
they
had
the
potential
to
improve
with
age
this
big
beer
carries
a
warming
9
percent
alcohol
unlike
the
dubbel
which
brewery
workers
have
found
peaks
at
one
to
two
years
this
one
has
greater
long
cellaring
potential
a
maine
brew
that
measures
up
well
to
some
of
the
greats
from
belgium
had
a
long
and
soft
finish
barely
drying
and
luxurious
soft
mouthfeel
felt
like
cotton
in
all
a
pretty
good
beer
feels
imported
without
being
so
pours
a
golden
apricot
color
with
a
tall
pillowy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
into
a
thick
and
creamy
lace
leaving
spider
webs
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
recedes
nose
is
tropical
fruit
with
some
sweet
herbal
and
spicy
aromas
taste
is
sweet
candied
sugar
up
front
followed
by
notes
of
raw
honey
and
then
some
nutty
yeast
flavors
lots
of
spicy
alcohol
comes
through
towards
the
end
with
some
additional
notes
of
white
pepper
a
very
nice
brew
and
yet
i
was
still
expecting
a
bit
more
i
think
ill
try
aging
a
few
bottles
to
see
how
they
develop
in
any
event
its
wonderful
to
see
this
beer
finally
available
here
in
texas
this
tripel
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
creamy
full
white
foam
that
left
lace
on
the
glass
the
carbonation
was
lively
the
smell
was
musty
grapes
green
apples
and
pears
very
pleasant
and
long
lasting
the
taste
was
sweet
candy
sugar
and
musty
grape
and
herbal
with
some
oak
alcohol
and
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
creamy
and
warming
the
body
was
medium
with
a
nice
crisp
aftertaste
this
tripel
had
obviously
aged
very
nicely
and
was
a
joy
to
savor
slowly
very
enjoyable
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
a
rare
treat
brought
back
from
chicago
by
trbeer
three
cheers
for
interstate
beer
run
by
a
friend
this
is
in
the
750
ml
size
batch
33
pours
gold
with
a
distinct
amber
hue
three
finger
head
sizeable
but
not
overwhelming
smell
is
of
yeast
and
sugar
there
is
a
slight
chill
haze
i
started
a
bit
on
the
cold
side
and
let
the
beer
warm
in
a
tulip
glass
i
get
a
slight
burning
sensation
of
alcohol
in
the
first
sip
some
yeasty
taste
not
as
sweet
as
other
tripels
ive
had
im
picking
up
some
slight
bitterness
hoppy
taste
that
im
not
used
to
having
in
a
tripel
the
aftertaste
though
leaves
a
bit
more
sweetness
than
bitterness
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
seems
best
i
dont
know
if
it
is
all
the
goodness
settling
or
the
warming
temperature
the
alcohol
defintely
kicks
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
did
i
mention
trbeer
is
one
hell
of
a
guy
the
9
abv
is
deceptively
smooth
it
sneaks
up
on
you
rather
than
hitting
you
over
the
head
ive
got
to
get
some
more
of
this
one
another
top
quality
brew
from
allagash
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
huge
head
and
every
visual
characteristic
of
a
belgian
style
seemed
similar
to
their
white
except
for
a
few
noticable
variations
the
appearance
reminded
me
of
orval
color
and
head
also
fruity
and
a
little
spicy
banana
comes
to
mind
fantastic
brew
best
when
on
the
warm
side
smooth
medium
to
full
bodied
very
balanced
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
and
saved
for
easter
dinner
this
is
an
excellent
beer
fitting
perfectly
to
style
with
the
best
of
the
tripels
very
drinkable
i
must
have
more
pale
golden
beer
served
with
a
white
head
a
bit
of
a
hazy
body
sweet
malty
aroma
with
some
subtle
spices
very
prominent
alcohol
sweetness
up
front
with
a
creamy
malt
taste
very
nice
bitterness
as
well
light
overall
but
yet
very
powerful
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
the
drinkability
is
dangerously
good
this
beer
put
me
at
a
bit
of
a
loss
for
words
as
i
can
say
i
truly
enjoyed
it
but
yet
i
cant
quite
put
the
experience
into
words
a
very
wonderful
beer
that
should
not
be
overlooked
or
passed
over
if
the
opportunity
arises
pours
a
mediumdark
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
that
doesnt
want
to
go
away
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
for
dear
life
all
the
way
down
aroma
is
crisp
citric
lemon
spicy
clove
yeasty
banana
and
light
malt
doughy
flavor
is
also
crisp
sweet
start
making
way
for
some
banana
and
clove
to
coat
the
tongue
in
the
middle
ends
with
some
citrus
lemon
and
grapefruit
mostly
full
body
complex
flavors
that
get
more
impressive
as
the
bottle
gets
more
empty
only
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
at
the
end
a
big
tripel
cheers
to
murph
for
this
one
750ml
corked
bottle
its
batch
33
and
a
hazy
goldenburnt
orange
mix
of
color
the
head
is
fluffy
and
enormous
the
appearance
of
tripels
is
such
a
joy
to
stare
at
a
fruity
aroma
greets
my
nose
not
as
strong
as
other
tripels
i
have
tried
though
but
my
nose
is
horrible
so
it
might
be
an
amazing
aroma
the
flavors
are
yeasty
fruity
and
slightly
spicy
it
even
has
a
refreshing
quality
to
it
very
smooth
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
in
the
finish
a
wonderful
tripel
out
of
maine
just
as
good
as
the
belgians
golden
brew
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
pretty
nice
white
head
on
top
good
retention
great
yeast
spiciness
in
the
aroma
paired
with
fruitiness
and
backed
up
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
on
the
palate
its
no
less
a
delight
tripel
honey
malt
and
lots
of
it
but
thats
not
all
far
from
it
its
rather
well
hopped
as
well
playing
against
the
malt
very
well
the
spiciness
is
big
as
well
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
but
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
finish
is
even
more
smooth
and
creamy
huge
warming
effect
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
among
my
favorites
in
the
style
im
very
glad
this
beer
was
made
available
to
us
here
in
arizona
i
had
never
seen
any
allagash
stuff
here
before
i
got
this
i
cant
wait
to
try
their
other
stuff
highly
recommended
allagash
of
portland
maine
is
probably
more
known
for
their
white
beer
but
this
triple
that
i
had
on
tap
at
the
sharp
edge
is
quite
a
tasty
treat
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
rather
thin
white
head
and
it
barely
sticks
to
the
glass
aroma
is
spiced
up
with
some
cinnamon
like
tones
and
a
mild
banana
tone
on
top
of
all
of
the
estery
alcoholic
fragrance
that
creeps
upon
my
senses
flavor
profile
contains
a
full
alcoholic
slight
honey
full
sweetness
that
is
warming
to
the
sipper
of
this
fine
beer
there
is
also
pleasant
notes
of
yeast
within
this
highly
carbonated
offering
from
our
friends
in
new
england
i
would
say
the
texture
has
a
medium
body
with
a
slightly
sticky
candied
sugar
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
beer
one
right
after
another
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
due
to
9
abv
tonight
was
a
good
night
why
you
ask
because
i
discovered
this
beer
and
i
discovered
2
hours
of
kids
in
the
hall
on
comedy
central
while
the
allagash
tripel
was
all
spiced
cream
and
fruits
mostly
bananas
and
peaches

hey
yellow
not
a

not
bad
allagash
is
certainly
impressing
me
its
nice
to
see
them
finally
hit
our
market
although
i
believe
i
will
treat
this
as
special
ocassion
brews
given
the

batch

a
pleasant
surprise
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
magnificent
bubbly
head
that
retains
well
in
proper
glassware
the
nose
is
full
of
fruit
and
yeast
at
first
with
notes
of
spiciness
prevailing
as
the
beer
warms
up
taste
is
similar
with
the
spicy
notes
taking
priority
quite
effervescent
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
and
an
excellent
pairing
with
food
the
alcohol
in
this
certainly
has
its
warming
effects
but
its
hard
to
notice
it
until
the
beer
is
long
gone
to
be
sure
a
great
americanbrewed
tripel
pours
a
beautiful
golden
orange
color
with
a
huge
stickycreamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
great
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
great
fruity
aromas
of
some
bananaorangespeaches
and
some
very
nice
subtle
spiciness
as
well
awesome
fruity
tastes
with
some
great
light
fruitiness
and
awesome
subtle
spiciness
tha
high
alcohol
only
makes
itself
known
in
the
warming
effect
it
has
smooth
and
creamy
this
beer
is
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
absolutely
awesome
and
a
no
brainer
for
the
price
dark
golden
hue
w
a
hint
of
ale
haze
topped
by
a
dense
bumpy
very
well
retained
porcelain
white
head
that
leaves
lace
sweet
tropical
fruity
esters
consisting
of
ripe
mango
and
lychees
dominate
the
aroma
with
yeast
mustiness
and
hints
of
bready
malt
secondary
unfiltered
pure
honey
sweetness
hits
the
palate
at
first
then
yields
to
pleasantly
spicy
black
pepper
and
mellow
clove
fruity
esters
that
mirror
the
aroma
emerge
mid
palate
and
when
combined
with
the
lightly
peppery
alcohol
notes
leave
a
sweet
but
rich
black
licorice
flavor
although
hop
bitterness
is
paltry
residual
sweetness
is
well
controlled
and
integrated
into
the
overall
fruity
profile
moderate
in
body
and
lacking
the
aggressive
carbonation
common
to
many
tripels
truly
dangerous
in
drinkability
finishes
with
a
fructose
like
sweetness
fading
quickly
although
initially
mild
ethanol
warmth
grows
progessively
stronger
after
each
taste
an
absolutely
delcious

suspect
if

cheers
to
allagash
for
an
very
good
representation
of
the
belgian
style
tripel
huge
off
white
head
that
lasts
forever
so
dense
it
protruded
34
over
the
top
of
the
glass
fruity
aroma
with
classic
fruit
and
spice
flavor
a
real
treat
and
ranks
right
up
there
with
its
belgian
counterparts
notes
another
stellar
brew
from
allagash
top
shelf
here
perfect
example
of
the
style
rich
in
intricacies
and
incredibly
drinkable
one
of
the
greatest
american
beers
brewed
in
the
belgian
style
13
second
only
to
stoudts
triple
a
very
very
very
good
beer
nice
n
alcoholic
worth
seeking
out
such
a
great
tasting
beer
on

its
close
to
heaven
disappearing

and
minimal
lace
light
gold

sweet
dried

sweet

good
brew
very
nice
beer
not
for
the
weak
of
heart
disappointed
by
this
one
big
fan
of
this
brewery
probably
the
best
texas
beer
i
have
ever
tried
very
good
taste
given
the
high
abv
very
good
drinkability
for
the
abv
my
favorite
real
ale
beer
thus
far
great
buzz
soft
hop
profile
more
like
an
ale
but
too
pungent
and
sweet
not
my
cup
of
tea
im
more
of
a
bitter
ipa
rips
fan
took
about
3
to
4
bottles
to
get
used
to
it
no
great
but
not
horrible
eh
this
is
one
of
the
better
tripels
that
ive
had
nice
combination
of
fruit
and
alcohol
with
a
decidedly
sweet
finish
its
definitely
a
tripel
though
not
as
rich
and
full
as
some
of
my
other
favorites
especially
among
the
belgians
good
enough
however
that
i
buy
it
when
i
can
and
look
forward
to
it
year
round
great
color
and
taste
but
not
quite
as
much
head
as
i
might
like
love
to
drink
it
on
tap
sometime
only
had
it
from
the
bottle
so
far
flowery
nose
oily
mouthfeel
definitely
tastes
like
a
tripel
alcohol
fairly
prominent
nonexistent
head
which
was
disappointing
although
maybe
it
was
a
bit
too
chilled
pretty
good
tripel
from
one
of
the
best
brewers
in
south
texas
nice
triple
fermented
beer
flavorful
to
the
nose
and
nice
crisp
taste
these
words
are
true
this
beer
has
a
high
ass
abv
with
deceptively
smooth
flavor
that
can
lead
to
severe
drunkenness
comparable
abv
beers
such
as
dogfish
head
90
minute
or
new
belgium
rampant
tend
to
remind
me
exactly
how
potent
they
are
with
their
flavor
intensity
and
thickness
while
this
brew
goes
down
easy
like
a
light
beer
but
hits
just
as
hard
and
unique
smoky
crisp
overtones
that
have
serious
nostalgic
value
for
a
guy
who
was
raised
in
and
has
lived
in
texas
his
whole
life
sipping
this
i
am
reminded
of
outdoor
fire
pits
and
the
sensation
of
warmth
in
the
winter
i
seriously
recommend
this
beer
for
anyone
who
has
the
opportunity
to
try
it
it
might
be
a
little
more
expensive
than
some
of
the
other
real
ale
brews
or
a
larger
pack
of
lower
quality
beer
but
trust
me
its
worth
it
if
i
could
get
paid
to
tattoo
this
beers
label
across
my
back
i
would
enjoyd
ap

ar

sab

sens

cj

overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
with
a
nice
texas
tinge
i
highly
recommend
it
this
is
a
staple
in
my
beer
fridge
i
am
lucky
to
live
in
dripping
springs
texas
which
is
only
a
few
miles
from
the
brewery
located
in
blanco
real
ale
makes
fantastic
brews
firemans
4
is
another
staple
and
even
though
they
are
a
very
high
quality
house
we
can
get
alot
of
their
great
stuff
in
just
about
any
convenience
storegas
station
in
the
hill
country
as
a
huge
aficianado
of
belgian
ales
especially
trippels
best
in
the
world
imho
i
had
tried
many
so
called
craft
belgian
trippels
before
with
usually
great
disappointment
but
i
was
blown
away
by
this
one
when
real
ale
introduced
it
in
2010
they
got
it
right
and
they
have
kept
on
doing
that
a
bit
of
background
this
beer
has
been
aged
approx
7
months
there
is
a
listed
warning
to
drink
by
32914
it
is
currently
july
2014
usually
there
is
not
a
sellby
date
on
beer
and
one
can
usually
age
belgian
beer
many
years
if
desired
therefore
not
a
true
belgian
beer
but
an
attempt
on
the
style
this
had
potential
even
with
the
wild
all
over
the
place
aroma
it
still
could
have
locked
in
to
be
a
good
brew
the
flavor
starts
that
way
than
poof
gone
its
just
too
watery
in
both
mouthfeel
and
especially
the
end
of
the
drink
to
rate
it
too
highly
close
but
no
cigar
or
beer
for
that
matter
owas
a
solid
beer
enjoyed
it
o
pretty
good
tripel
example
maybe
a
bit
too
hoppy
o
a
pretty
nice
american
take
on
a
tripel
that
had
a
lot
of
character
but
the
booze
came
through
pretty
prominently
even
for
the
style
i
always
love
a
good
belgian
tripel
and
this
is
a
great
texas
example
of
the
style
it
is
a
light
golden
color
that
deceptively
hides
its
high
alcohol
content
but
while
the
color
is
light
there
is
nothing
light
about
the
taste
it
has
all
the
signature
belgian
yeast
notes
with
some
spicing
and
a
slight
hop
to
help
balance
out
the
flavors
it
has
a
robust
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
balanced
finish
this
is
a
solid
tripel
o
not
terribly
impressive
maybe
i
have
a
bad
bottle
on
my
hands
id
like
to
think
so
i
get
some
tripeltype
flavors
but
the
bitterness
really
usurps
the
whole
experience
frankly
im
surprised
by
some
of
the
scores
on
this
one
o
while
it
is
a
timid
tripel
i
found
it
enjoyable
the
banana
and
belgian
yeast
spiciness
were
complimentary
and
refreshing
o
a
really
good
drinkable
belgian
style
beer
low
c
that
said
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
the
price
high
abv
for
the
same
price
as
the
other
offerings
of
real
ale
it
definitely
is
a
good
nightcap
kind
of
beer
o
great
changeofpace
brew
with
all
of
the
major
key
notes
of
a
tripel
winedrinkers
would
love
this
brew
its
tasty
i
dont
personally
think
its
rabcs
best
but
then
they
have
made
quite
a
few
beers
that
i
really
enjoy
so
its
a
bit
hard
to
choose
ok
its
still
a
tie
between
four
squared
and
altbier
if
you
force
me
to
tell
but
the
devils
backbone
is
pretty
good
too
being
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
ales
from
this
golden
style
to
a
deep
dark
divinity
like
chimay
grande
reserve
this
one
is
right
up
my
alley
the
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
is
not
strong
like
an
ipa
somwhere
around
35
ibus
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
16oz
short
bellshaped
glass
with
handle
color
is
a
beautiful
goldenrod
and
smell
is
fruity
like
subdued
bananas
and
sweet
malts
feeling
on
the
tongue
and
palate
is
thicker
than
wheat
beer
but
nowhere
near
amber
or
dark
belgian
ale
head
dissipates
very
quickly
in
such
a
widemouth
glass
and
barely
lasts
3min
in
a
thin
fluted
glass
no
matter
because
if
you
like
a
little
bitter
with
your
golden
cream
then
this
is
a
beer
for
your
roster
i
give
it
a
45
because
it
lacks
a
little
in
complexity
though
there
are
spices
noted
throughout
the
tasting
experience
i
will
definitely
buy
again
as
it
delivers
a
simple
tripel
experience
without
the
belgian
tripel
price
a
very
americanized
version
of
a
classic
this
one
is
good
for
advocates
to
become
acquainted
with
the
heavier
belgian
styles
excellent
for
a
sweet
tooth
and
quite
refreshing
rjt
overall
very
nice
drink
its
almost
too
deceiving
because
three
of
these
will
get
me
woozy
i
would
never
think
that
this
was
8
from
how
smooth
it
goes
down
one
of
the
more
tasty
beers
from
real
ale
quite
the
tang
on
this
one
somehow
it
works
well
enough
but
its
not
really
bringing
balance
or
a
level
of
complexity
that
keeps
it
interesting
i
think
i
can
sum
if
up
by
saying
that
its
pretty
one
dimensional
and
frankly
this
is
what
belgian
styles
of
yesteryear
tasted
like
when
coming
out
of
the
u
s
i
drank
this
fairly
warm
and
picked
up
slight
alcohol
vapors
and
flavor
which
provided
a
nice
warming
sensation
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
pretty
nice
tripel
overall
o
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
and
found
it
a
notch
or
two
better
than
the
dicks
belgian
tripel
centralia
wa
which
i
also
had
the
same
night
o
a
decent
tripel
overall
a
bit
heavy
and
not
as
balanced
as
id
like
but
still
enjoyable
drinking
this
one
from
the
bottle
seems
to
add
to
the
style
pouring
it
into
a
tulip
is
all
well
and
good
however
theres
just
something
special
about
drinking
straight
from
the
bottle
it
tones
down
the
fruitiness
and
alcohol
taste
this
beer
needs
to
be
reviewed
by
the
bros
for
sure
good
flavor
nice
blend
not
bad
especially
if
you
arent
familiar
with
the
true
belgians
thoroughly
pleasant
brew
that
may
not
be
a
world
class
tripel
but
it
does
credit
to
the
style
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
pinkies
in
san
angelo
texas
overall
a
very
drinkable
a
pleasant
beer
albeit
deceivingly
high
in
abv
grab
one
on
tap
if
you
can
got
from
total
wine
in
dallas
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
its
by
far
the
best
ive
had
from
real
ale
a
sweet
start
is
topped
off
my
a
nice
spicy
semismokey
finish
that
perfectly
masks
the
8
abv
it
is
classified
as
a
abbey
style
tripel
however
its
not
really
like
any
style
beer
ive
ever
had
before
o
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
for
this
style
but
it
definitely
gets
the
job
done
you
can
certainly
taste
and
feel
the
alcohol
up
front
there
is
some
citrus
fruit
taste
to
me
but
not
overpowering
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
im
really
starting
to
like
real
ale
brewing
company
smooth
and
creamy
somewhat
bitter
and
peppery
lingering
dry
aftertaste
vague
fruitiness
thats
hard
to
pin
down
though
orange
and
apricot
come
to
mind
plenty
yeasty
and
phenolic
in
the
taste
following
the
aroma
seems
pretty
solid
a
textbook
tripel
is
it
a
decent
beer
compared
to
big
brew
yeah
compared
to
other
lines
from
real
ale
its
average
pours
a
clear
gold
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
hops
alcohol
slight
yeast
sweet
malt
hint
of
citrus
and
subtle
spice
fits
the
style
of
a
tripel
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
foremost
citrus
sweet
malt
slight
yeast
spice
and
a
hint
of
hops
overall
good
body
blend
and
aroma
botg

this
is
a
local
brew
that
i
shamefully
havent
ever
tried
before
thanks
to
my
boy
brandon
for
sharing
this
with
me
poured
from
bottle
into
dfh
snifter
fluffy
white
head
doesnt
recede
much
and
billowing
amounts
of
carbonation
flow
off
the
bottom
of
this
crystal
clear
burnt
orange
colored
beer
after
i
get
it
in
the
glass
really
nice
looking
smell
honey
burnt
caramel
candied
sugar
spices
on
the
end
nice
taste
hmm
i
got
a
mouth
full
of
spices
maybe
nutmeg
cinnamon
in
there
some
sweetness
behind
it
but
what
i
didnt
get
that
i
was
really
expecting
was
that
honeyburnt
caramel
flavor
that
i
got
on
the
aroma
this
actually
has
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
on
it
and
doesnt
have
that
big
backbone
that
you
would
expect
to
get
from
a
tripel
regardless
this
is
a
solid
brew
one
that
i
would
have
again
one
of
the
great
things
about
the
rootrootdrink
challenge
is
being
forced
to
try
new
beers
and
this
is
a
nice
outcome
finding
a
local
beer
that
youve
passed
over
before
that
is
really
pretty
good
good
carbonation
and
quite
drinkable
check
it
out
if
you
like
tripels
and
belgians
but
if
you
tend
to
shy
away
from
them
this
may
not
be
for
you
spiced
seasonal
and
having
said
that
i
think
i
like
this
better
the
appearance
is
clear
gold
with
white
head
head
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
full
of
ripe
banana
and
mild
waves
of
clove
there
is
also
a
bit
of
honey
and
lemon
present
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
grape
banana
and
lemon
spicy
cloves
balance
out
the
sweetness
nicely
the
body
is
some
what
big
and
the
carbonation
is
low
overall
this
is
a
great
american
tripel
with
lots
of
delicate
banana
flavor
very
nice
job
on
a
tripel
from
a
good
texas
brewery
tastes
light
and
delicate
with
a
lot
of
nuanced
estery
flavor
i
pictured
lavender
fields
with
a
touch
of
honey
at
the
end
delicious
overall
impression
for
my
1st
brew
from
real
ale
i
may
need
to
go
back
to
tx
to
live
again
and
see
what
other
brews
they
offer
from
all
their
breweries
this
tripel
was
great
and
very
complexed
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
wanting
a
great
example
of
this
style
or
would
like
to
have
a
fully
complexed
beer
with
tons
of
malt
sweetness
and
spice
12oz
bottle
sent
to
me
by
somebody
here
but
i
forgot
your
name
thanks
man
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
couple
wisps
of
bubbles
atop
looks
good
smells
bready
and
estery
a
little
banana
the
taste
is
good
but
subtle
some
sweetness
some
yeast
and
esters
very
little
alcohol
in
the
taste
overall
this
was
pretty
decent
and
i
dont
usually
like
american
tripels
atmosphere
is
good
deep
golden
appearance
but
not
much
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
however
is
a
good
combination
of
grains
and
citrus
flavor
is
hoppy
grainy
with
sweet
and
fruit
tones
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
d
great
american
tripel
in
6pack
format
more
breweries
need
to
be
doing
this
dangerously
easy
to
drink
would
love
to
have
one
at
the
peak
of
freshness
to
taste
a
greater
hop
profile
big
ups
to
brad
for
this
want
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
o
could
have
used
a
lot
more
carbonation
and
significantly
more
flavor
the
bottle
claims
this
as
a
seasonal
the
back
of
the
bottle
says
keep
cold
and
drink
soon
at
the
bottom
thought
that
was
funny
o
very
impressed
one
of
the
best
pure
tripels
ive
had
pretty
good
beer
without
that
earthtinge
this
would
be
a
very
good
tripel
but
that
muddiness
really
does
the
taste
no
favors
o
i
loved
this
beer
it
was
very
balanced
and
there
was
just
enough
funk
and
tartness
in
the
taste
to
keep
my
interested
and
coming
back
for
more
i
recommend
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
with
the
aroma
and
tastes
just
so
harmonisously
balanced
as
a
side
note
i
bought
a
sixer
in
houston
at
specs
for
8
50
above
average
trippel
and
worthy
of
a
visit
overall
is
a
god
beer
i
really
liked
this
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
that
lasts
throughout
the
beer
and
laces
nicely
aroma
has
a
strong
sweet
fruit
and
floral
note
with
some
candied
sugar
and
sweet
grains
flavor
is
a
bit
more
mellow
with
a
semi
sweet
grain
start
that
becomes
sweeter
with
candied
sugar
and
light
fruits
drinks
lightly
which
is
nice
and
refreshing
medium
bodied
mouthability
overall
although
not
the
beall
endall
of
tripelsobviously
there
are
better
out
there
still
a
very
solid
interpretation
that
i
would
highly
recommend
and
definately
pick
up
again
very
impressed
with
the
complexities
of
this
real
ale
offering
well
i
think
anyone
who
drinks
this
can
tell
its
not
brewed
in
belgium
however
thats
not
a
knock
its
not
exactly
like
i
remember
other
tripels
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
and
i
appreciate
its
9
abv
without
it
really
being
prominent
for
a
hot
texas
summer
this
is
a
good
pick
for
a
more
complex
yet
drinkable
beer
with
a
little
more
booze
than
normal
like
i
said
at
9
99
for
a
six
pack
of
a
good
tripel
i
dont
see
how
anyone
wouldnt
recommend
this
6
210
its
pretty
good
for
a
tripel
edit
this
beer
is
not
good
it
actually
sucks
sorry
if
i
sent
someone
an
extra
of
this
my
mind
was
clouded

d
i
liked
this
a
lot
because
its
the
first
tripel
ive
had
in
a
while
that
is
this
clean
love
the
spiciness
as
well
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
soapy
white
head
that
left
just
a
little
lacing
the
smell
consists
of
lemon
wheat
and
candisugar
with
a
hint
of
black
pepper
the
taste
is
mostly
sour
lemon
and
wheat
there
is
some
candy
flavor
spicy
hops
and
its
slightly
tart
and
alcoholic
this
beer
is
smooth
as
silk
with
a
medium
body
perfect
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
im
not
a
fan
of
tripels
but
this
is
my
favorite
one
so
far
overall
very
nice
strong
beer
from
real
ale
a
must
for
summer
in
texas
if
drinking
the
6er
solo
do
it
at
home
it
sneaks
up
on
you
o
a
very
easy
to
drink
tripel
the
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
and
the
strong
flavour
profile
makes
this
one
a
pleasure
highly
recommended
one
of
my
favourite
seasonals
from
real
ale
love
it
neck
and
neck
with
lfdm
big
ups
to
blanco
o
not
on
the
same
level
as
allagashs
tripel
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
and
at
a
fraction
of
the
price
overall
it
was
not
bad
alothough
i
have
had
much
better
a
clear
golden
in
appearance
with
a
creamy
white
head
smells
strongly
of
ethyl
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
banana
taste
is
initially
candy
sweetness
followed
by
a
spicy
yeast
character
then
a
neutral
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
grainy
wheat
alcohol
is
detectable
mouthfeel
is
full
smooth
carbonation
overall
a
good
tripel
tho
a
bit
boozy
for
my
tastes
overallgreat
beer
theres
not
many
tripels
that
i
buy
on
a
regular
basis
but
this
one
would
be
if
it
wasnt
a
seasonal
brew
real
ale
continues
to
put
out
some
very
nice
limited
beers
too
bad
there
rotation
beers
suck
poured
into
a
tulip
the
beer
is
dark
gold
in
color
with
a
white
two
finger
head
there
isnt
much
head
retention
but
there
is
some
lacing
there
is
lot
of
belgium
yeast
in
the
nose
along
with
a
trade
mark
belgium
spiciness
there
is
also
plenty
of
candy
sugar
and
malts
along
with
some
very
present
alcohol
taste
is
pretty
mild
considering
the
aromatics
there
are
mild
malts
and
grains
up
front
along
with
floral
hops
through
the
middle
to
the
finish
you
get
belgium
sugar
spices
and
bready
yeast
the
alcohol
is
still
present
although
more
toned
down
the
mouth
feel
is
excellent
its
smooth
easy
and
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
just
right
overall
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
american
version
of
the
tripel
style
i
always
look
forward
to
this
release
serving
type
bottle
thanks
freeverse
for
the
opportunity
d
it
was
drinking
average
cause
the
booze
was
definitely
there
on
the
taste
but
was
a
solid
tripel
imo
d
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
would
enjoy
working
through
a
sixpack
but
in
the
world
of
tripels
this
probably
fits
somewhere
in
the
second
tier
opinion
i
was
really
anxious
to
like
this
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
i
do
with
regards
to
style
as
with
so
many
other
american
breweries
that
try
to
make
tripels
i
have
to
try
to
convince
myself
that
they
are
quadrupels
instead
so
i
can
let
my
brain
get
over
the
styleguidelines
and
rate
the
beer
on
how
it
tastes
as
a
tripel
this
beer
leaves
a
whole
lot
to
be
desired
from
the
hops
to
the
attenuation
but
as
a
openended
quad
the
beer
is
pretty
decent
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
beer
again
but
i
am
not
going
to
have
a
problem
deciding
between
the
st
bernardus
tripel
or
this
one
i
will
just
drink
this
one
because
it
is
a
decent
highgravity
beer
by
one
of
texass
bigger
micros
d
it
took
me
much
longer
to
work
through
my
6oz
than
it
did
for
mike
i
think
i
ended
up
pouring
out
a
bit
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
again
d
average
drinkability
and
average
beer
for
the
style
interesting
name
and
location
but
just
good
for
a
one
time
drink
i
think
if
this
bottle
came
from
belgium
itd
have
higher
reviews
this
was
a
very
well
put
together
beer
by
real
ale
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
that
fades
too
fast
then
no
lacing
no
head
no
ring
smells
like
a
cross
between
a
triple
and
saison
a
little
fruity
pears
and
a
little
straw
and
grass
the
taste
is
slightly
fruity
kinda
dry
and
a
bit
spicy
some
peppery
notes
some
noble
hops
come
through
but
all
in
all
its
muddled
mouthfeel
is
kinda
one
dimensional
prickly
and
a
little
sharp
it
drinks
ok
while
a
tasty
beer
it
was
imho
a
poor
example
of
a
triple
i
thought
it
tended
more
towards
saison
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
some
slight
spice
and
belgian
yeast
as
well
as
a
bit
of
citrus
and
some
light
fruits
taste
is
a
bit
of
pale
spice
and
light
fruit
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
in
there
as
well
feel
is
slightly
spicy
and
boozy
with
a
good
body
drinks
fairly
well
and
is
better
than
the
blonde
i
had
from
them
but
perhaps
needs
a
bit
of
time
to
mellow
d
a
friend
brought
this
back
from
a
trip
to
texas
while
he
really
enjoyed
it
i
cant
get
over
the
alcohol
taste
on
swallow
d
not
a
bad
tripel
overall
and
it
actually
goes
down
very
easily
maybe
too
easily
i
guess
i
expect
a
little
more
alcohol
bite
flavorspicey
intensity
warmthheat
and
this
is
just
a
bit
too
tame
for
a
tripel
tripels
are
usually
more
of
a
sipping
style
for
me
but
this
one
demands
big
gulps
and
disappears
quite
rapidly
best
domestic
tripel
i
have
ever
drunk
not
quite
as
good
as
la
fin
du
monde
but
given
the
price
difference
i
may
have
to
switch
a
ton
of
flavor
hops
arent
overwhelming
but
you
can
definately
taste
em
not
a
beer
to
mess
around
with
due
to
its
alcoholic
content

but
i
am
glad
to
be
trying
it
real
ale
is
making
texas
residents
like
myself
proud
thanks

bright

with

some

dominated
by
a

of

that
clashes
badly
with

quite
hot

notes
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
texas
beer
out
of
a
commercial
brewery
we
once
did
a
tasting
between
this
and
fin
du
monde
and
it
was
pretty
much
neck
and
neck
if
you
like
tripels
and
you
get
the
chance
to
try
this
one
go
for
it
you
wont
regret
it
overall
this
beer
is
just
okay
it
doesnt
have
any
standout
qualities
and
its
flavor
didnt
impress
me
conclusion
i
liked
this
one
and
would
defiantly
have
it
again
so
far
this
has
been
my
favorite
from
real
ale
and
i
would
choose
this
one
over
new
belgium
trippel
wcoriander
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
american
take
on
a
belgian
tripel
theres
still
room
for
improvement
but
this
would
be
a
great
introductory
beer
to
someone
interested
in
exploring
belgian
style
ales
poured
into
an
oversize
wine
glass
this
settles
a
foggy
yellow
golden
color
with
bright
yellow
highlights
under
a
quickly
diminishing
bubbly
head
a
floral
bouquet
fills
the
nose
with
hints
of
candied
sugar
pumpkin
pepper
spice
and
lemon
this
opens
up
with
a
lively
and
spicy
big
tart
taste
that
makes
way
to
a
juicy
huge
delicious
fullflavored
malty
center
and
burnt
sugar
follow
through
by
the
sip
this
slowly
goes
from
being
an
aggressive
brew
on
the
palate
to
a
smooth
and
complex
treat
that
i
particularly
enjoyed
with
prosciutto
de
parma
pours
a
hazy
blood
orange
yellow
gold
small
head
with
some
lacing
not
particularly
spicy
smelling
some
nice
sweet
malts
and
light
fruits
like
apricots
and
pears
taste
is
similarly
sweet
but
enjoyable
pears
and
other
light
fruits
mouthfeel
is
good
and
only
slightly
thin
nice
slightly
creamy
carbonation
good
drinkability
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
trippel
with
some
bananas
and
cloves
very
nice
beer
from
the
folks
at
real
ale
d
good
high
alcohol
content
but
i
like
how
well
real
ale
covered
this
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
tap
next
spring
devils
backbone
eh
sounds
sinister
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
banana
clove
pepper
rye
bread
lemon
zest
and
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
similar
though
with
a
heavier
tilt
toward
those
hops
as
such
the
citrusy
bitterness
not
unlike
an
orange
rind
is
quite
pronounced
driving
the
yeasty
and
spicy
notes
underground
popping
up
only
when
able
or
when
crime
is
afoot
turtle
power
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
tripel
a
bit
heavy
on
the
bitters
for
me
but
not
enough
to
ruin
things
worth
a
try
for
sure
an
excellent
triple
i
have
always
enjoyed
this
on
tap
when
the
season
came
i
am
so
happy
this
is
now
bottled
i
think
it
is
even
better
out
of
the
bottle
which
is
the
only
reason
i
am
doing
a
second
review
probably
the
best
american
version
i
have
had
of
the
style
again
well
done
real
ale
this
is
a
mouthful
of
of
just
a
different
combos
of
spices
and
sort
of
a
hint
of
banana
cream
at
first
sip
it
is
great
then
after
a
3rd
or
even
5th
sip
you
sense
the
alcohol
taste
and
somewhat
of
a
sting
to
your
cheeks
and
gums
its
a
drink
you
know
the
alcohol
is
there
but
still
is
a
great
drink
to
chill
with
the
friends
not
something
i
can
handle
all
night
and
just
chug
poured
into
a
westmalle
chalice
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
decent
lacing
the
scent
isnt
too
strong
but
the
belgian
yeast
is
very
noticable
the
taste
has
the
rather
smooth
saaz
hop
bitterness
and
that
candy
sugar
mixed
in
with
that
strong
belgian
yeast
giving
a
citrus
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
leaves
a
sting
to
your
cheeks
might
be
something
that
could
mellow
out
with
age
d
i
really
like
this
tripel
it
may
not
be
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
texas
doesnt
have
too
many
belgians
this
beer
surprised
me
as
it
is
actually
good
d
ive
heard
this
described
as
a
hybrid
between
an
tripel
and
a
hefeweizen
and
im
inclined
to
agree
the
fruity
banana
flavors
that
i
typically
associate
with
hefes
are
present
here
its
a
solid
beer
but
hefes
are
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
so
that
knocks
it
down
a
bit
id
like
the
alcohol
toned
down
a
bit
it
was
just
a
little
too
obvious
in
very
aspect
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
beers
from
real
ale
and
ive
been
pretty
impressed
with
both
the
low
carbonation
takes
away
from
this
one
but
its
not
a
bad
attempt
at
a
tripel
d
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
find
the
perfect
body
and
funky
yeast
covers
it
all
up
d
this
is
a
nice
attempt
at
a
belgianstyle
brew
not
entirely
successful
but
fairly
enjoyable
regardless
flat
out
didnt
enjoy
this
d
a
decent
tripel
i
thought
it
smelled
very
good
but
wasnt
as
big
a
fan
of
the
taste
would
give
another
shot
my
favorite
of
their
specialseasonal
offerings
so
far
cheers
hazy
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
but
active
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
right
off
the
bat
smells
of
peaches
lemons
and
pepper
taste
is
sharp
and
citrusy
up
front
then
has
a
dusty
malty
caroby
thing
that
takes
over
it
finishes
dry
and
sharp
with
just
enough
of
that
dusty
finish
to
make
you
want
more
the
aftertaste
is
a
touch
metallic
and
bitter
not
at
all
what
you
get
from
the
rest
of
the
taste
profile
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
slippery
it
stands
up
fights
back
drinkability
is
good
though
limited
by
the
aftertaste
very
good
but
not
great
that
being
said
one
i
would
buy
again
and
im
very
excited
to
see
some
local
breweries
branching
out
beyond
the
standard
ipabrownblondepale
ale
offering
verdict
devils
backbone
is
a
solid
american
tripel
but
fails
to
really
grab
me
its
just
a
little
too
muddled
and
leafy
for
my
tastes
godd
drinkability
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
it
all
night
but
two
or
three
would
be
a
good
start
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
decent
brew
and
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
ra
as
i
feel
their
beers
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
not
the
best
tripel
but
tasty
and
moderately
priced
i
would
get
again
but
not
in
a
rush
it
is
pretty
drinkable
imo
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
on
e
of
these
and
will
not
be
buying
more
but
thanks
for
the
offering
and
the
privilage
to
try
this
good
real
ale
the
beer
pours
a
clear
medium
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
which
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
lemons
oranges
pears
and
mangoes
with
alcohol
coriander
and
candisugar
the
flavor
is
lemon
peach
oranges
and
pears
with
yeast
candisugar
and
spices
the
spices
are
pepper
and
coriander
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
carbonation
not
that
much
complexity
but
its
very
enjoyable
and
at
a
resonable
price
on
par
with
golden
monkey
but
a
notch
below
lfdm
westmalle
tripel
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
tripel
but
would
have
liked
more
complexity
still
its
worth
a
shot
not
a
horrible
beer
but
really
hard
to
get
down
d
quite
drinkable
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
arent
careful
the
2010
backbone
is
great
the
aroma
is
clean
and
fruity
pears
grapes
honey
its
a
gorgeous
translucent
almost
opaque
amber
in
appearance
like
clover
honey
the
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
with
a
bit
of
lace
clinging
to
the
glass
and
around
the
edges
of
the
beer
its
very
drinkable
even
in
a
month
or
two
when
its
going
to
be
warm
here
in
austin
dry
spicy
fruity
finish
yum
guys
d
a
very
strong
effort
out
of
blanco
tx
i
am
always
leary
of
tripels
that
are
outside
of
the
trappist
traditions
but
this
is
great
i
will
concede
a
local
bias
though
taste
is
a
pungent
and
tasty
mix
of
fruit
flavors
candy
sugar
and
a
touch
of
hops
hop
and
alcohol
notes
are
detectable
but
almost
entirely
concealed
by
the
standard
tripel
flavor
the
finish
is
just
a
touch
bitter
however
which
wasnt
expected
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
standout
area
as
devils
backbone
has
a
rich
and
creamy
body
that
is
more
substantial
than
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
tripel
the
strength
of
flavor
and
abv
limit
drinkability
a
touch
but
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
the
flavor
starts
well
enough
with
some
doughy
pale
malts
and
cracker
crust
a
quick
kiss
of
spices
light
fruits
and
floral
hops
drop
out
of
the
middle
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
especially
in
the
finish
where
the
bitterness
gets
acerbic
and
slightly
harsh
with
booze
body
is
on
the
chewy
side
of
medium
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
but
the
aftertaste
causes
the
mouthfeel
to
be
taken
down
a
notch
drinkability
too
still
a
wellcrafted
american
tripel
and
one
that
would
probably
cellar
well
if
it
were
bottled
silky
smooth
and
creamy
sweet
malts
lightly
caramel
with
loads
of
alcohol
and
a
nice
crisp
bittering
finish
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
exceptional
with
maybe
612
months
the
flavors
would
meld
together
perfectly
it
is
really
good
now
but
the
individual
components
are
a
bit
dramatic
very
good
tripel
put
this
in
a
bottle
please
at
4
75
a
pint
it
was
a
tad
expensive
for
me
but
in
the
end
it
was
definately
worth
shelling
out
the
extra
cash
for
the
beer
gave
me
that
droopy
eyed
feeling
after
a
very
short
amount
of
time
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
thick
head
that
reduces
to
fingers
then
a
rim
smells
more
of
hops
than
it
tastes
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
tastes
rich
and
sharp
with
lots
of
amber
malt
in
there
some
complex
tastes
are
hiding
in
the
back
and
it
has
a
great
aftertaste
combined
with
sharpness
from
the
alcohol
up
front
feels
thinner
than
id
expect
from
a
tripel
with
some
cut
from
the
alcohol
overall
fairly
better
than
average
i
sampled
this
at
the
brewery
its
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
tasted
smooth
and
like
i
expect
a
tripel
to
taste
it
was
slightly
less
sweet
than
anticipated
with
a
very
gentle
amount
of
carbonation
of
the
5
or
6
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
all
have
been
above
average
the
workers
at
the
brewery
are
friendly
and
the
tour
was
great
pours
a
pale
cloudy
body
with
some
foamy
head

a
belgiany

i
didnt
notice
the

in
appearance
this
is
a
burnished

with
a
moderate
head
of
foam
on
top
the
nose
is

with
a

a

fruit

candy
in
the
taste
very
very
delicious
stuff
another
fine
beer
from
the
true
brewing
professionals
up
in
blanco
this
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
wonderful
tripel
that
i
wish
more
people
could
try
theres
a
quaint
wheatiness
that
reminds
me
of
a
witbier
this
is
a
lighter
softer
tripel
than
im
used
to
no
wild
and
zany
phenolic
fun
but
oh
well
its
tasty
d
hella
drinkable
for
a
tripel
it
is
pretty
cool
that
such
a
fine
triple
is
being
made
right
here
in
tx
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
and
savorstrength
and
weight
make
this
a
great
sipper
it
was
a
hazy
orangecopper
beneath
a
full
head
of
offwhite
froth
the
head
held
well
and
it
left
beautiful
creamy
walls
of
lace
in
its
wake
the
nose
was
honeyish
and
spicy
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
some
phenols
that
left
it
perfumey
the
mouthfeel
was
bristling
with
tinybubbled
effervescence
and
it
was
medium
in
body
the
flavor
followed
the
lead
of
the
aroma
but
added
in
an
orangecitrus
side
that
was
unexpeceted
the
rye
was
clear
and
its
peppery
edge
cut
through
nicely
the
bitterness
was
moderate
as
it
should
have
been
with
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
and
alcohol
keeping
it
dry
it
finished
honeyish
and
dry
with
lingering
notes
of
black
pepper
and
phenolics
its
a
sipper
for
sure
and
a
pint
of
it
during
a
party
was
not
the
way
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
id
much
rather
have
had
it
in
a
quiet
setting
as
a
sipping
beer
still
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
but
i
went
back
for
a
pale
ale
instead
interesting
and
enjoyable
pours
a
bright

along
with
some
belgian
spice
and
a

taste
begins
with
fruity
orange
citrus
and
maybe
a
bit
of
pineapple
and
honey
malt
followed
by
some
biscuity
notes
and
a
bit
of
clove
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
astringent
bite
with
some
spice
to
it
the
aroma
is
complex
with
sweet
competing
with
astringent
notes
color
is
off
not
enough
belgian
funk
to
it
needed
to
have
more
spicyness
and
possibly
a
little
thiner
on
the
body
its
very
drinkable
but
im
not
sure
if
this
qualifies
as
a
tripel
overall
im
very
happy
with
m
selection
i
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
as
i
love
trying
obscure
belgians
especially
tripels
and
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
yeasty
with
a
good
after
taste
reminds
me
of
being
in
belgium
very
foamy
and
a
nice
orange
gold
appearance
poured
into
a
cold

going
to
have
another

me

the

the
aroma
is
bright
there
are
roasted
malts
candi
sugar
apples
pears

there
is
that
typical
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
flavor
is
bready
from
the
malts
and
the
yeast
and
also
mildly
sweet
i
also
pick
up
those
fruit
flavors
i
found
in
the
aroma
but
not
as
strongly
the
hops
bring
a
subdued
floral
flavor
to
this
beer
as
well
as
some
balance
there
is
some
tartness
on
the

the
alcohol
is
masked
in
all
those
flavors
its
very
well

the

a

has
a

not
quite
up

my
favorites

this
is
one
id
happily
have
again
taste
is
slightly
banana
hint
of

this
tastes
like
a
highly
carbonated
cider
i
get
bored
drinking
it
way
too
much
carbonation
for
me
i
thought
the
aroma
and
appearance
were
wonderful
but
just
cant
seem
to
get
past
the
carbonation
if
it
were
carbonated
a
bit
less
i
think
the
flavors
would
come
through
better
on
the
palette
and
not
mask
the
mouthfeel
as
much
dark
orange
in
color
with
a
deep
murky
haze
and
yellowish
hues
on
the
edge

a

medium

flavor
up

with

corriander
thru

banana
and
sweet

thru
to
the

sweet
malty
backbone
throughout
with
banana
and
yeasty
flavors
in
the
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
throat
from
the
middle
thru
the
finish
finishes
with
a
brief
citrus
tangy
aftertaste
o
one
of
the
easier
to
drink
tripels
ive
had
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
ill
try
to
come
from
style
guidelines
when
i
rate
o
very
highquality
tripel
has
a
good
smell
complex
taste
and
perfect
amount
of
alcohol
worth
trying
once
maybe
twice
as
someone
has
already
noted
in
a
previous
review
this
ale
is
heavily
reminiscent
of
the
same
brewerys
bruegel
but
while
the
punch
is
greater
here
8
versus
5
i
think
bruegel
is
the
superior
drink
having
more
nuanced
flavors
that
last
much
longer
into
the
mouthful
notes
a
really
luxurious
decadent
tripel
that
regales
you
with
its
story
and
isnt
afraid
of
over
indulging
however
not
the
most
complex
or
dynamic
this
brew
poured
up
a
murky
applejuice
colored
body
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
loads
of
lacing
scents
of
yeast
and
malts
intermingled
with
a
bit
of
honey
and
ripe
bananas
flavors
are
near
the
same
with
the
yeasts
and
malts
and
some
spices
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
and
something
near
the
lines
of
a
sour
mash
taste
at
the
finish
the
body
is
light
and
thin
with
an
ease
of
drinkability
for
those
that
havent
dabbled
with
tripels
this
is
a
good
start
but
know
that
tripels
should
possess
a
flavor
complexity
greater
than
what
this
brew
presents
i
wish
this
brewery
would
peel
back
a
little
on
the
intensity
of
the
yeast
and
make
a
belgian
ipa
they
have
the
perfect
base
for
it
skol
drink
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
one
just
didnt
give
me
that
triple
flavor
i
was
looking
for
or
the
pop
overall
its
another
winner
for
brouwerij
van
steenberge
i
cant
help
but
draw
comparisons
to
the
bornem
tripel
i
had
last
night
essentially
the
same
style
beer
and
from
the
same
brewery
this
beer
is
somewhat
similar
but
it
is
drier
more
bitter
and
gets
more
of
its
flavor
from
hops
and
malts
as
opposed
to
cloves
or
other
spices
all
good
things
imo
it
is
also
much
fruitier
overall
a
good
example
of
a
triple
flavor
isnt
as
full
or
robust
as
other
examples
but
good
nontheless
worth
trying
pours
a
thick
fivefinger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
citrus
and
yeast
flavor
is
wheat
and
yeasty
very
good
triple
but
not
my
choice
of
triples
from
this
brewer
gulden
draak
and
piraat
are
better

pale
malts

pale

it
has

the
flavor
is
of
sweet
pale

moderate
alcohol
for
the
style
and
a
good
amount
of
yeast
its
very
solid
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
it
could
use
a
little
more
honey
or
spice
to
it
it
drinks
fine
for
the
style
and
has
the
body
youd
hope
for
and
expect
i
like
it
its
definitely
solid
considering
a
big
bottle
was
only
6

id
recommend
trying
it
626
o
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
triples
out
there
too
sweet
doesnt
hide
the
alcohol
all
that
well
and
excessively
coarse
carbonation
decent
enough
but
generally
average
for
the
style
medium
to
mediumfull
but
carbonation
keeps
this
moving
not
a
cloying
brew
and
very
complex
does
not
have
the
intensity
of
some
others
of
the
style
but
this
is
one
youd
grab
again
after
tasting
this
beer
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
labeled
a
tripel
style
though
strong
in
alcohol
this
was
so
bitter
and
sour
it
was
much
more
like
a
sour
ale
congratulations
to
the
brewers
for
moving
so
far
outside
the
box
on
this
style
d
overall
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
definitely
one
that
is
alot
like
the
style
worth
a
try
but
not
one
ill
be
going
back
to

i
find
myself
seldom
disappointed
by
the
belgian
mastersanother
well
recommended
brew
to
behold
here
d
as
with
many
belgianstyle
ales
this
beer
goes
down

can
easily

multiple

at

sitting
might
get
a

it

nice
full

as
this

a

solid
brew
smooth
great
taste
lots
of
alcohol
d
decent
brew
but
not
as
good
as
some
other
examples
of
the
style
its
definitely
a
great
beer
and
a
solid
tripel
but
the
playing
field
is
large
and
expert
when
youre
talking
about
tripels
made
in
belgium
which
is
why
i
cant
put
this
one
into
the
solid
a
category
an
all
around
solid
tripel
drinkabilty
too
mellow
and
simplistic
for
my
liking
triples
are
to
be
flavor
heavy
and
complicated
this
is
too
easy
to
drink
and
lacks
punch
it
would
be
embarrising
to
put
this
up
against
trappist
rochefort
or
unibrowes
la
fin
maybe
a
good
starter
beer
for
first
time
triple
drinkers
or
even
if
you
dont
like
triples
dont
have
any
need
to
drink
this
again
drinkability
a
very
spicy
triple
not
my
favorite
but
still
good
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
is
the
chalk
flavor
probably
from
the
yeast
strain
meh
not
my
first
choice
but
would
do
well
in
a
pinch
i
dumped
mouthfeeldrinkability
spicy
and
stinging
carbonation
slightly
chewy
but
still
thin
overall
medium
bodied
moist
in
the
finish
that
makes
one
want
more
as
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
well
balanced
makes
a
good
session
drink
when
staying
sober
is
not
an
issue
d
the
high
carbonation
moves
things
along
while
the
extremely
clean
and
dry
finish
really
make
it
easier
to
drink
makes
me
think
of
a
slightly
heavier
sparkling
wine
the
spices
are
more
subdued
on
this
but
it
has
a
nice
tang
to
it
good
fruit
flavors
combined
with
a
tasty
yeast
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
fairly
light
body
with
carbonation
mask
the
abv
well
balanced
and
fairly
interesting
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
white
head
nose
brings
a
good
amount
of
floral
and
citrus
notes
along
with
some
grain
and
caramel
as
well
as
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
floral
with
some
light
lemon
and
grain
as
well
as
some
light
fruits
and
belgian
yeast
medium
feel
with
pretty
good
carbonation
drinks
pretty
well
and
is
a
very
nice
beer
overall
d
a
very
good
triple
but
beware
this
is
strong
stuff
creamy
and
smooth
going
down
with
a
fairly
open
and
medium
mouthfeel
a
faint
residual
alcohol
heat
tickles
the
throat
the
most
unique
tripel
ive
tasted
and
one
of
the
most
satisfying
d
i
would
love
to
try
this
with
pasta
or
cheeses
great
beer
giving
it
a
good
drinkablity
because
it
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
that
should
be
a
firsttimers
intro
to
the
style
drinkable
but
not
overwelming
been
sitting
on
this
for
about
45
years
but
it
seems
to
have
held
up
pretty
well
i
get
from
the
beginning
a
big
boozy
sweety
malt
bomb
at
8
this
is
a
powerfull
beer
you
feel
each
sip
with
some
booze
cant
say
i
liked
it
a
ton
but
compared
to
the
style
and
possible
age
this
is
a
well
made
beer
with
a
great
brewing
tradition
just
boozy
there
are
better
tripels
out
there
but
this
is
worth
a
try
very
high
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
can
drink
all
night
as
its
packed
with
flavor
and
goes
down
easy
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
i
will
revisit
this
beer
again
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
yeasty
flavors
with
a
dry
crisp
finish
and
a
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
quick
especially
for
a
8
abv
great
beer
i
really
like
this
one
give
it
a
try

good
i
would
drink
think
till
i
fell

at

dont
really
notice
the

alcohol
kind
of
a
meh
tripel
ok
but
not
exciting
worth
trying
once
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
dont
think
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
didnt
really
have
a
single
aspect
that
i
thought
was
really
well
done
or
true
to
style
if
i
tried
it
blind
i
would
know
for
sure
its
a
belgian
but
i
dont
think
i
would
be
able
to
guess
that
its
a
tripe
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
wasnt
the
smoothest
a
little
crisp
a
little
sticky
slightly
boozy
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
half
the
bottle
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
and
theres
no
way
that
i
would
want
another
one
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
great
but
it
was
still
the
highlight
and
the
truest
to
style
aspect
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
aroma
they
were
the
downfall
of
this
beer
and
they
were
both
bland
and
not
true
to
style
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
know
for
sure
its
fresh
but
other
than
that
i
dont
think
i
will
be
revisiting
it
any
time
soon
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
either
all
in
all
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
too
special
since
the
other
bornem
beers
werent
that
great
but
i
was
at
least
hoping
this
would
taste
like
a
tripel
and
i
was
disappointed
that
it
did
not
this
is
one
of
the
crappier
tripels
ive
had
but
it
still
isnt
as
bad
as
that
bornem
amber
that
i
had
to
drain
pour
this
one
seems
like
it
needs
a
lot
of
work
better
luck
next
time
guys
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
monochromatic
okay
and
would
not
say
no
to
it
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
a
little
too
much
astringentness
and
an
odd
mix
of
cracker
and
sweet
at
the
end
of
the
taste
overall
an
alright
drinking
brew
however
and
at
least
worth
giving
a
try

dry
delicious

this
tripel
will
sneak
up
on
you
and
rob
you
of
all
your
belgian
francs
or
euros
or
both
fantastic
as
a
sipper
its

would
allow
it

almost
any
food
of
which
you
can
conceive
excellent
work
once
again
by
the
maestro
brewers
at
van
steenberge
brewery
o
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
fruiter
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
is
quite
drinkable
because
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
well
masked
from
the
taste
o
a
solid
beer
for
an
off
night
o
not
bad
but
pretty
midtier
as
far
as
tripels
go
a
tasty
tripel
that
doesnt
want
to
punch
you
in
the
jaw
with
alcohol
presence
all
of
the
phenols
and
yeast
flavors
are
in
the
right
place
mouthfeel
is
excellent
a
winner
golden
clear
appearance
with
good
foamy
head
great
nose
and
even
better
taste
in
my
opinion
this
is
better
than
any
other
belgian
ale
dubbel
or
triple
than
ive
had
with
the
possible
exception
of
dt
o
not
good
i
dont
like
tripels
but
still
i
did
not
like
this
rjt
o
lacked
a
bit
of
depth
but
scores
lots
of
points
for
the
look
aroma
and
for
how
well
the
booze
was
hidden
this
beer
is
smooth
low
to
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
a
bit
boozy
and
a
little
watery
on
the
palate
this
was
an
alright
triple
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
but
i
was
expecting
more
flavors
and
aromas
from
what
i
am
used
to
and
also
the
cleanliness
that
comes
with
those
characteristics
o
despite
the
great
body
and
nice
smell
the
beer
is
a
bit
listless
in
the
flavor
department
its
an
easy
drinker
but
i
wouldve
liked
more
complex
spices
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
spices
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
however
a
finger
length
of
white
head
remains
atop
the
beer
without
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
plenty
of
tiny
streaming
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
and
side
of
the
glass
there
are
fruity
aromas
i
detect
green
apple
and
pear
there
is
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
the
candi
sugar
as
well
it
smells
like
a
typical
but
decent
tripel
there
is
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
this
beer
brining
some
solid
bread
flavor
the
fruit
flavors
are
a
bit
more
subdued
but
the
apple
and
pear
are
definitely
there
the
alcohol
is
detectable
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
body
is
full
with
strong
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
but
lacks
the
typical
tripel
dryness
the
alcohol
is
very
warming
and
this
definitely
is
a
sipper
this
is
a
good
beer
that
did
not
quite
live
up
to
its
potential
o
was
excited
to
try
this
but
it
turned
out
to
be
nothing
special
a
disappointment
after
a
great
surprise
a
couple
days
ago
with
a
tripel
karmeliet
overall
i
would
prefer
other
tripels
over
this
one
not
terrible
but
really
not
that
great
either
o
not
bad
but
with
so
many
great
tripels
out
there
i
think
this
is
one
i
would
not
buy
very
often
still
worth
a
try
you
might
find
it
suits
your
tastes
better
than
mine
o
the
aromas
exploded
after
letting
the
beer
sit
out
for
a
little
while
to
warm
up
this
is
a
delicious
tripel
and
i
pretty
much
finished
the
whole
glass
during
this
review
if
someone
asked
me
if
they
should
try
this
tripel
i
would
absolutely
say
yes
i
think
it
is
quite
light
but
still
captures
all
of
the
elements
of
a
tripel
d
despite
the
above
setbacks
still
a
decent
tripel
not
something
i
would
revisit
again
unless
it
came
in
the
same
assorted
holiday
6pack
as
gulden
draak
o
to
call
this
average
is
an
insult
to
a
well
made
triple
but
it
is
an
average
beer
if
i
were
grading
this
solely
to
style
which
i
never
do
it
would
be
worse
whoa
this
is
an
active
one

taste

sweet
crackery
slight

light

this
style
is
not
terribly
drinkable
but
this
is
a
nice
sipper
on
a
chilly
damp
night
all
in
all
a
fine
choice
with
my
meal
and
id
definitely
have
another
one
another
time
o
i
saw
this
at
the
store
and
bought
it
because
id
never
seen
one
before
i
wish
id
read
the
reviews
first
its
far
from
bad
but
its
a
very
disappointing
tripel
and
in
my
opinion
not
worth
five
dollars
i
cant
recommend
it
but
nor
do
i
have
heavy
criticism
overall
i
found
this
a
good
ale
though
i
was
surprised
at
how
dry
and
flowery
it
came
across
as
i
was
expecting
far
more
sugars
definitely
worth
trying
as
this
nicely
expands
the
range
of
flavors
available
for
trippels
in
a
nuanced
balanced
very
drinkable
package
o
just
average
this
was
part
of
that
6
pack
of
belgian
imports
box
glad
i
tried
it
but
on
to
the
next
one
overall
again
very
interesting
and
transitioning
type
of
taste
very
good
taste
and
fun
to
think
about
drink
an
average
triple
wont
be
coming
back
to
this
one
this
is
a
good
beer
and
while
i
dont
think
id
want
too
many
id
certainly
order
this
im
not
sure
what
my
overall
score
will
be
but
i
have
to
rate
fairly
and
the
smell
and
taste
were
not
above
average
this
is
certainly
an
above
average
beer
though
and
i
am
giving
it
a
strong
4
overall
o
approaches
average
for
a
belgian
tripel
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
color
solid
foamy
head
nose
is
a
really
malty
baked
bread
with
a
touch
of
spice
thick
and
rich
malty
and
peaty
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
i
surely
have
never
had
a
beer
that
so
reminded
me
of
that
gauntlet
one
must
run
when
entering
the
womens
section
of
a
big
department
store
boozy
floral
and
strained
there
is
little
comfort
in
this
offering
the
alcohol
too
metallic
and
bracing
instead
of
subtly
integrated
and
the
fruitiness
wrapped
up
in
its
own
eau
de
toilette
nightmare
d
drinable
but
not
in
the
same
way
as
other
triples
ive
tried
o
i
feel
like
this
has
potential
but
needs
a
lot
of
refinement
everything
about
it
is
harsh
overcarbonated
too
chalky
and
bad
astringency
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
delicate
style
and
there
is
nothing
delicate
about
this
beer
a
good
triple
is
highly
drinkable
for
the
high
alcohol
content
but
i
could
barely
finish
just
a
single
330ml
bottle
my
recommendation
stay
away
far
far
away
jd
o
i
dont
find
this
beer
to
be
all
that
good
nor
very
representative
of
the
style
definitely
not
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
triple
d
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
my
personal
palate
wants
more
flavor
from
this
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
from
the
330
ml
bottle
marked

sampled
on

2011
the
pour
is

it
was

up

bit
in
the
drive
home
the
aroma
has
a
pleasing
balance
of
malts
and
yeast
with
an
easy
to
find
alcohol
scent
the
taste
is
malty
and
yeasty
but
there
is
also
a
sharp
bitterness
in
the
mix
that
is
easy
to
remember
nice
overall
clear
golden
blonde
color
with
huge
head
standing
firm
for
a
minute
or
so
aromas
of
spice
and
candies
appear
initially
but
quickly
fade
taste
has
some
fruit
notes
a
bit
of
spice
and
clear
candies
of
course
but
also
a
bit
bland
and
watered
down
that
shouldnt
be
the
case
here
even
for
a
triple
perhaps
too
much
clear
candy
or
lacking
diversity
of
ingredients
bottle
may
have
been
stored
improperly
at
the
store
or
may
require
additional
aging
but
i
dont
believe
that
is
necessarily
the
case
easily
drinkable
but
disappoints
for
an
authentic
belgian
triple
drink
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
beer
had
a
fantastic
appearance
but
it
really
didnt
stand
out
much
in
the
other
categories
im
still
happy
i
tried
it
final
thoughts
there
isnt
much
of
a
question
as
to
what
it
to
blame
for
this
beers
failure
overwhelming
alcohol
in
a
beer
doesnt
typically
work
out
for
me
unless
you
can
produce
enough
flavour
to
mask
it
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
its
really
a
shame
since
their
dubbel
was
so
good
huge
carbonation
almost
blew
out
of
the
bottle
big
hazy
gold
with
a
monster
head
smell
had
some
booze
on
the
finish
taste
was
kind
of
light
some
light
bready
notes
some
sweet
fruits
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
pretty
good
considering
the
massive
booze
i
liked
the
subtle
sweetness
but
the
almost
flat
taste
and
the
booze
dominant
finish
made
me
a
one
can
diane
on
this
but
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
the
alcohol
was
much
to
apparent
and
made
it
difficult
to
pick
out
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
three
finger
head
of
stiff
white
foam
heavy
lace
that
would
not
budge
color
is
a
5
of
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smells
of
apple
pear
citrus
and
malt
flavors
i
detect
apple
pear
orange
honey
lemon
pepper
malt
and
molasses
good
but
thin
mouthfeel
i
like
the
zip
from
the
carbonation
a
couple
of
these
with
little
food
will
get
you
flying
without
wings
good
flavor
and
kick
high
scores
in
my
book
some
better
but
this
will
do
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
appearance
is
excellent
for
the
style
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
big
billowy
white
head
the
nose
is
also
richly
funky
i
like
the
yeast
strain
they
used
there
is
something
off
in
the
taste
however
in
the
balance
and
in
the
aftertaste
there
are
better
tripels
ill
finish
this
glass
and
its
not
bad
but
this
is
a
tripel
from
belgium
they
need
to
step
up
to
the
level
of
the
competition
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
choose
again
drinkabilty
this
would
be
a
good
starter
tripel
needs
more
flavor
too
one
dimensional
with
yeast
and
malts
my
tastes
are
far
too
high
to
enjoy
this
again
theres
enough
alcohol
also
to
make
this
a
one
and
done
beer
dnot
the
greatest
triple
in
fact
not
a
good
triple
at
all
i
barely
finished
this
one
a
second
would
be
quite
a
task
i
will
never
recommend
this
to
anyone
quite
an
enjoyable
little
beverage
for
me
ill
revisit
this
one
quite
often
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
colour
with
thick
fluffy
white
head
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
though
leaving
some
laving
smells
of
huge
belgian
yeastiness
with
bready
malt
some
very
mild
hops
are
there
flavour
is
a
little
bit
boozy
with
the
alcohol
coming
through
more
than
many
tripels
quite
a
smooth
mouthfeel
just
an
ok
beer
for
the
style
drinkability
the
alcohol
could
play
less
of
a
role
but
adds
some
nice
sweetness
still
an
easy
to
drink
beer
d
smells
great
but
falls
short
after
that
way
better
tripels
out
there
a
deep
golden
to
amber
color
with
a
soft
white
colored
head
a
quarter
inch
high
a
strong
bread
fragrance
with
a
touch
of
mustiness
that
is
followed
by
a
yeasty
scent
with
a
mild
citric
fragrance
at
the
end
a
bread
flavor
is
out
at
the
front
of
each
taste
followed
by
a
sweer
sugary
of
dried
fruit
mostly
currants
and
raisons
it
finishes
with
a
yeasty
twang
flavor
that
lingers
long
after
each
taste
as
passed
the
feel
is
watery
at
the
front
that
grows
to
medium
bodied
feel
the
palate
is
left
with
an
arid
and
dry
feel
that
stays
there
for
some
time
this
is
a
descent
beer
with
good
color
a
weak
aroma
but
a
solid
taste
and
feel
lift
it
up
d
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
the
aroma
is
really
cool
as
well
however
the
taste
really
brings
this
beer
down
it
didnt
end
up
being
a
drain
pour
but
it
honestly
was
not
very
enjoyable
grains
honey
floral
pear
lemon
slightly
syrupy
honeysuckle
sweetness
dry
finish
cloves
phenols
hint
of
alcohol
kind
of
meh
slightly
too
thin
body
ticks
some
boxes
but
never
does
anything
to
make
you
love
it
too
sweet
a
little
too
simple
and
unrefined
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
colour
with
a
giant
bubbly
white
head
that
shows
good
retention
and
leaves
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
light
shows
hints
of
fruit
bready
malt
and
spice
the
taste
is
of
sweet
apple
and
pear
at
first
which
leads
into
some
citrus
hops
bready
malt
and
spiciness
and
finishes
dry
and
mildly
boozy
sharp
and
lively
carbonation
as
expected
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
middling
tripel
i
couldnt
really
pick
up
anything
off
about
it
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
about
this
beer
really
blew
me
away
d
very
drinkable
the
9
0
is
nowhere
to
be
found
other
than
a
short
and
very
subtle
bit
of
heat
near
the
end
of
your
sip
more
or
less
a
sweet
fruit
focussed
tripel
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
anybody
who
doesnt
like
sweet
too
much
not
mindblowing
but
good
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
a
fait
triple
and
fairly
drinkable
as
well
appearance
is
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
not
too
much
lacing
nose
brings
forward
spice
grain
pear
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
spice
pepper
and
alcohol
along
with
some
mildlyfruity
grain
light
to
medium
feel
with
good
carbonation
not
enough
oomph
as
far
as
im
concerned
but
still
pretty
tasty
drinkability
in
all
a
good
beer
i
think
the
carbonation
is
too
heavy
then
the
beer
itself
not
spectacular
but
not
bad
either
its
a
tripel
but
not
a
spectacular
one
it
is
a
very
dry
beer
d
i
think
if
i
was
going
to
go
out
and
get
a
tripel
i
would
pass
for
another
option
this
absolutely
lacks
the
crispness
the
freshness
and
the
welldefined
clean
flavors
of
a
good
triple
i
would
never
buy
this
again
there
are
a
100
better
domestic
triples
that
are
infinitely
better
and
cheaper
than
this
crap
unibrouegolden
monkeyallagashdark
horsenew
hollandavery
this
beer
was
a
delight
on
a
sunny
afternoon
i
feel
almost
as
if
the
beer
matches
the
near
cloudless
sky
outside
reminding
me
in
taste
and
initial
feel
of
a
hefeweissbier
and
in
aftershock
of
a
champagne
intriguing
indeed
and
something
i
enjoy
about
the
belgian
monk
brewers
they
know
how
to
make
a
truly
great
beer
d
an
ok
tripel
but
this
is
nowhere
in
the
realm
of
westmalle
and
st
bernardus
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
leaves
a
bit
for
wanting
a
bit
more
structure
nice
and
dry
although
the
flavour
seems
a
bit
wonky
the
mouthfeel
provides
an
enjoyable
delivery
there
are
better
tripels
out
there
to
frequent
more
often
not
too
filling
just
right
a
straight
and
honest
triple
ive
briefly
hopfeully
run
out
of
pithy
shit
to
say
here
so
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
active
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
the
usual
tripel
characterstics
pepper
cardamom
spicy
yeast
and
a
dash
of
wheatiness
the
taste
follows
though
seems
a
bit
spicier
than
other
tripels
as
though
some
extra
pepper
and
nutmeg
were
swirlin
about
in
there
theres
also
a
tinge
of
lemony
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
a
lighter
medium
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
relatively
dry
finish
a
stoic
tripel
indeed
d
it
is
far
from
the
best
tripel
on
the
market
but
i
would
drink
it
alcohol
is
well
masked
a
nice
brew
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
there
are
hints
of
spice
in
the
taste
and
smell
which
is
the
best
thing
io
can
say
about
this
dont
get
me
wrong
it
s
perfectly
ok
other
than
that
but
nothing
really
great
eh
forgettable
reallly
not
all
that
great
somewhat
overly
carbonated
mouthfeel
overall
a
drinkable
brew
but
i
much
preferred
the
dubble
from
this
brewery
d
it
was
ok
i
did
get
used
to
the
finish
it
is
a
decent
clean
tasting
tripel
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
amount
of
head
the
aroma
is
great
very
fruity
with
a
character
similar
to
a
white
wine
the
taste
is
a
flat
out
dissapointment
there
is
a
lot
of
off
flavors
that
arent
covered
up
by
the
fruit
or
spices
basically
its
a
big
dissapointment
of
a
beer
with
way
too
much
going
wrong
md
mouthfeel
is
harsh
and
tart
im
glad
im
sharing
this
bottle
so
i
dont
have
to
drink
much
of
this
d
im
not
really
liking
this
beer
its
not
awful
at
all
there
are
just
way
better
tripels
out
there
d
id
certainly
drink
this
again
and
would
rate
it
above
average
not
outstanding
but
still
a
good
selection
notes
maybe
too
much
carbonation
really
but
a
light
and
decent
flavor
bottle
at
granville
moores
with
some
fantastic
moules
moroccan
d
yes
but
nothing
outstanding
poured
from
a
brown

2

a
cloudy
light
brown
color
with
a
slow
falling
1
5
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
spices
some
fruits
taste
is
a
good
combination
of
fruits
spices
malts
and
alcohol
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
yeast
has
really
done
a
number
on
this
beer
it
pretty
much
dominates
very
bready
and
the
alcohol
combines
with
some
fruity
yeast
esters
to
create
quite
the
tropical
profile
theres
a
little
bit
of
lemon
in
there
as
well
as
a
splash
of
cola
hell
this
one
is
pretty
close
to
a
long
island
iced
tea
especially
with
the
alcohol
being
quite
prevalent
not
a
very
smooth
tripel
for
sure
its
ok
and
is
fun
to
try
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
tripels
out
there
strong
belgianstyle
mouthfeel
d
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
tripel
overall
bottle
into
tulip
can
you
say
disappointed
i
had
some
higher
expectations
for
this
given
some
of
what
i
had
sampled
from
this
brewery
recently
unfortunately
this
did
not
really
live
up
to
my
expectations
beer
poured
a
pale
amber
just
a
little
darker
then
your
usual
american
macrobrew
a
half
finger
head
fell
fast
leaving
a
slight
lacing
as
it
did
the
nose
was
a
little
of
everything
you
would
expect
from
an
abbey
style
but
the
alcohol
was
starting
to
dominate
which
i
usually
dont
detect
over
the
normal
aromas
the
taste
was
rather
boring
though
all
of
the
usual
complexity
of
an
abbey
was
missing
replaced
instead
by
a
general
malt
sweetness
with
an
alcohol
bite
not
a
terrible
beer
but
far
from
the
best
out
there
overall
a
solid
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
of
the
bunch
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
more
pronounced
than
other
belgians
ive
had
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
wish
i
could
tell
when
it
was
imported
or
better
yet
brewed
pours
a
very
clear
golden
yellow

a

typical
football
beer
big
foamy

goodsized
bubbles
somewhat
lasting
very
fruity
somewhat
floral
aroma
lots
of
pear
and
light
fruit
light
colored
grapes
some
spiciness
too
perfumy
but
almost
a
fake
type
smell
floral
taste
some
fruit
and
some
nuttiness
near
the
end
pretty
clean
after
taste
some
light
fruit
some
harshness
and
some
alcohol
crisp
but
i
was
hoping
for
smooth
very
fruity
drinkability
a
decent
dubbel
but
there
are
certainly
many
better
examples
out
there
still
not
too
bad
huge
foamy
white
head
takes
a
long
time
to
settle
coating
the
walls
of
my
chalice
along
the
way
hazy
orange
in
colour
with
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
this
attractive
looking
beer
smells
of
tart
green
apple
and
lemon
with
hints
of
banana
and
hay
flavour
shows
apple
skin
lemon
pear
and
pepper
its
just
a
little
bit
boozy
starts
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
sharp
medicinal
bitterness
prickly
carbonation
gives
this
medium
bodied
beer
a
lift
in
the
beginning
it
smoothes
out
and
gets
creamier
as
the
carbonation
subsides
not
fantastic
but
still
enjoyable
and
satisfying
very
drinkable
excellent
poured
a
11
2oz
stubby
into
my
hennepin
globe
glass
this
beer
pours
a
extremely
hazy
golden
straw
with
a
massive
white
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
at
least
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
odd
for
a
tripel
it
reminds
me
of
a
mix
between
a
rather
hoppy
saison
and
a
strong
hefeweizen
while
there
is
a
nice
grainy
quality
that
presents
a
mellow
tropical
fruit
aroma
clove
banana
and
yeasty
biscuits
come
though
man
this
is
just
an
odd
combination
it
actually
kind
of
put
me
off
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
big
hefe
really
big
banana
flavors
clove
a
bit
of
nutmeg
and
yeasty
biscuits
while
tripels
are
not
my
favorite
style
this
one
just
seems
completely
wrong
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
rather
light
carbonation
also
normally
these
thing
have
a
rather
effervescent
carbonation
that
cleans
the
palate
but
this
one
just
falls
flat
while
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
it
just
seems
way
off
for
the
style
if
the
point
of
this
beer
is
to
be
bland
with
a
few
interesting
twists
then
it
is
a
winner
if
it
is
out
to
mix
it
with
the
best
of
belgiums
triples
then
its
a
big
miss
having
said
that
its
not
a
dog
either
have
a
try
who
knows
it
may
be
what
you
have
been
looking
for
d
very
drinkable
not
tremendously
exciting
but
a
versatile
flavor
once
again
another
van
steenberge
winner
i
have
been
very
impressed
with
this
brewery
overall
bornem
may
not
have
met
all
the
classic
guidelines
for
a
tripel
but
who
cares
it
was
very
good
beer
has
a
very
strong
flavor
to
it
and
an
unfortunate
aftertaste
that
is
the
return
of
the
lactic
not
sourness
but
a
kind
of
odd
bitterness
deduction
on
mouthfeel
second
taste
sweetness
esters
are
there
second
taste
was
not
as
good
as
the
first
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
overall
its
ok
like
any
good
triple
youre
liking
it
even
more
by
the
end
d
this
is
a
perfectly
adequate
belgian
tripel
nothing
stellar
or
outstanding
about
it
but
it
definitely
holds
its
own
its
not
horrible
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
revisit

put

on

im
thinking
something
lighterskinned
blended
with
a

slightly
sweet

bitter
dry
finish
picking
up
on
a
bit
of
sulfur
in
the
finish
as
well
that
gets
masked
by
a
lingering
taste
of
what
i
am
picturing
as
bad
fruit
mixed
with
yeast
and
a
touch
of
hops
for
a
bitterness
kicker
the
higher
than
average
carb
level
is
helping
to
support
the
layer
of
head
that
still
remains
despite
the
initial
quick
dissolve
honestly
i
am
left
puzzeled
with
this
beer
my
opinion
of
it
has
been
a
roller
coaster
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
regardless
it
was
an
interesting
experience
a
nice
aftertaste
of
herbal
yeast
and
banana
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
dry
but
rounded
finish
d
a
solid
belgian
tripel
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
could
just
use
more
rather
lightly
flavored
and
somewhat
boozy
as
a
result
although
not
really
in
an
offensive
way
there
are
better
versions
out
there
but
its
worth
trying
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
golden
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
yeast
citrus
tart
malt
slight
sweet
malt
and
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
triple
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
tart
malt
hops
alcohl
yeast
and
slight
citrus
overall
very
high
carbonation
level
hurts
the
drinkability
but
a
good
blend
a
nice
example
of
a
triple
but
nothing
groundbreaking
big
white
head
of
three
fingers
on
this
sucker
quite
fragrant
too
the
nose
is
a
bit
like
an
apple
cider
but
it
clearly
has
an
added
point
of
bitterness
but
there
is
a
definite
cider
like
sweetness
a
good
cloudy
colour
of
well
cider
the
foam
is
bright
white
not
so
much
of
a
tripel
taste
though
the
odd
sweetness
and
yeastiness
does
give
the
evidence
of
the
style
good
abundant
carbonation
and
medium
feel
no
trace
of
the
alcohol
although
it
is
not
outstandingly
amazing
it
is
quite
good
and
as
tripels
go
a
very
drinkable
one
because
of
wellintegrated
balanced
flavor
everything
is
kept
in
check
and
working
toward
the
whole
rather
than
showboating
one
single
element
like
spices
or
yeast
or
alcohol
as
some
tripels
do
this
one
makes
balance
the
beall
endall
d
bornem
tripel
is
a
mild
and
very
drinkable
tripel
from
belgium
its
one
of
those
beers
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
gets
better
with
every
sip
quite
good
when
fresh
a
fruity
belgian
tripel
conclusion
this
would
be
an
awesome
tripel
if
it
wasnt
for
the
metallic
notes
though
these
do
dissapate
a
bit
as
the
beer
gets
closer
to
room
temperature
either
way
one
of
the
better
brews
from
this
brewery
overall
this
was
a
tripel
that
had
everything
but
just
not
in
the
right
amounts
the
flavors
never
seemed
to
pop
and
the
ending
wasnt
crisp
enough
however
its
far
from
being
a
bad
beer
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
the
style
drinkability
you
know
i
love
a
good
tripel
this
is
a
situation
where
its
definitely
the
leastgood
tripel
ive
had
but
its
still
a
solid
beer
in
a
great
delicious
style
light
golden
body
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
spice
and
lemon
the
flavor
is
spicy
too
and
also
contains
notes
of
lemon
some
honey
moderate
bitterness
and
a
spicy
dry
finish
medium
crisp
body
wont
wow
you
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
mass
of
good
belgian
tripels
but
it
is
a
well
made
beer
a
solid
offering
i
would
take
my
money
elsewhere
too
much
great
belgian
beer
to
settle
for
good
enough
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
a
nice
solid
belgian
ale
4
while
i
dont
actually
see
myself
having
it
often
im
pretty
impressed
with
bornel
triple
and
have
in
fact
liked
everything
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
so
far
i
could
imagine
people
saying
this
should
be
more
complex
or
whatever
but
in
its
pleasant
straightforward
way
i
dont
see
how
you
could
find
too
much
fault
and
the
mouthfeel
certainly
helps
make
up
for
the
narrowish
band
of
flavors
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
sample
pack
for
18
bit
pricey
but
nice
beers
to
try
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
overall
a
disappointment
just
tasted
strange
to
me
and
almost
artificial
when
all
is
said
and
done
this
is
a
beer
ive
overlooked
far
too
long
not
the
greatest
tripel
out
there
but
it
is
a
fine
beer
which
i
will
revisit
again
worth
a
try
if
you
like
this
style
wish
there
was
more
to
say
here
in
a
world
of
great
tripels
id
likely
pass
this
by
given
alternatives
while
it
was
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
it
just
didnt
seem
to
have
the
full
flavour
and
textures
ive
come
to
expect
if
you
get
a
chance
try
it
just
dont
expect
anything
all
that
special
d
good
9
though
so
take
your
time
hehe
it
goes
well
with
food
especially
smoked
food
i
split
the
bottle
with
a
friend
and
worked
my
way
through
my
glass
im
sure
the
drinkability
would
be
higher
if
fresh
but
not
to
bad
d
not
something
id
put
in
my
top
5
tripels
but
reliable
and
a
perfect
exercise
in
the
style
for
sure
recommended
m
d
sparkling
carbonation
not
as
foamy
feeling
as
others
rather
it
is
a
little
more
crisp
which
is
also
nice
slick
finish
not
a
whole
lot
of
residual
feeling
but
not
really
all
that
dry
either
though
there
is
a
bit
of
dryness
at
the
very
end
of
it
all
a
pleasant
beer
and
nothing
id
reject
on
offer
but
it
is
maybe
a
little
onedimensional
especially
compared
to
others
overall
not
a
bad
at
all
a
much
better
effort
than
their
double
which
i
could
barely
finish
a
good
flavour
profile
and
a
real
treat
for
the
eyes
this
is
one
ill
probably
have
again
recommended
this
beer
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
singlefinger
head
and
some
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
very
fruity
with
some
pear
and
apple
as
well
as
some
bready
yeast
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
dry
malt
that
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
almost
cidery
appleflavor
that
hides
the
alcohol
well
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
fine
champagnelike
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
not
the
most
complex
tripel
but
definitely
worth
a
try
d
at
9
with
some
heft
in
the
feel
were
getting
up
there
still
the
dryness
contributes
to
drinkability
as
well
as
making
it
a
good
food
companion
finish
is
nutmeg
and
cloves
goes
down
way
easy
pours
a
clear
pale
copper
nose
is
heavy
belgian
yeast
overall
a
shy
and
simple
aroma
with
a
slight
sourness
like
green
apple
taste
has
some
sweetness
light
fruit
like
cantaloupe
tartness
sourdough
spices
passive
strangely
seems
a
bit
weaker
than
their
dubbel
a
fun
experience
interesting
enjoyable
flavor
and
mouthfeel
not
the
most
standout
but
still
above
par
a
bit
ordinary
d
very
good
beer
i
purchased
a
single
330ml
i
would
have
this
again
but
i
think
there
are
significantly
better
abbey
ale
options
at
this
price
point
smooth
easy
drinker
for
a
big
beer
overall
quite
good
if
not
exactly
outstanding
can
tell
it
is
from
belgium
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
this
one
is
drinkable
enough
but
not
very
exciting
drinkability
a
decent
tripel
but
just
as
the
bornem
duddel
came
up
a
tad
short
so
to
does
their
tripel
paired
well
musically
with
the
song
cut
self
not
by
faraquet
d
a
nice
tripel
overall
not
my
favorite
take
on
the
style
but
im
glad
i
had
it
d
not
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
flavor
profile
for
the
starter
or
perhaps
subdues
by
design
could
have
2
or
3
of
these
very
easily
as
it
stands
now
bornem
has
produced
a
solid
delicious
tripelpleasant
flavorful
and
not
offputting
good
show
drinkability
if
you
ever
need
a
beer
to
warm
you
up
on
a
chilly
evening
this
would
help
you
out
in
that
area
there
is
one
thing
i
can
count
on
the
belgiums
besides
good
fries
and
waffles
and
thats
a
good
and
satisfying
beer
this
is
why
people
drink
and
really
enjoy
beer
would
come
back
to
this
over
and
over
again
try
when
you
get
the
chance
drinkability
is
good
it
is
a
good
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
there
are
better
belgians
out
there
slightly
light
in
flavor
but
still
enjoyable
notes
from
71204
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
this
one
again
soon
the
best
attribute
of
the
beer
is
that
it
is
quite
drinkable
although
i
find
most
tripels
quite
drinkable
paired
with
a
strong
hard
cheddar
gouda
or
gruyere
cheese
helps
with
the
mouthfeel
but
overall
there
are
many
better
tripels
out
there
including
one
by
the
same
brewery
drinkabiliity
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
triple
pour
looks
just
like
champagne
with
a
thicker
white
head
aroma
of
white
grapes
apples
sour
yeast
and
alcohol
tart
bitter
flavor
was
unexpected
but
not
bad
apples
grain
and
bready
prevalent
missing
the
nice
bananabubblegum
there
are
better
trippels
out
there
taste
is
a
bit
rich
with
notes
of
fruit
honey
and
cinnamonclove
feel
is
decent
once
the
carbonation
lets
off
a
little
steam
and
gives
the
beer
a
sense
of
lightness
with
respect
to
the
initial
richness
on
the
palate
drink
is
somewhat
limited
by
the
malt
structure
and
abv
a
decent
tripel
but
i
think
that
their
augustijn
offers
better
balance
and
complexity
i
see
this
often
in
the
smaller
bottle
and
its
often
not
as
good
maybe
freshness
is
an
issue
notes
a
solid
tripel
but
not
worth
the
effort
cost
compared
with
other
including
golden
monkey
more
readily
available
tripels
drinks
alright
hides
the
abv
well
but
nothing
special
as
tripels
go
d
average
drinkablility
better
with
food
then
to
quaff
on
its
own
d
this
beer
is
just
ok
but
i
would
probably
select
another
triple
if
given
the
option
d
i
could
drink
more
than
one
but
wouldnt
really
want
to
like
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
you
offered
me
one
but
for
my
coin
id
order
something
else
drinkability
is
fine
but
this
is
nothing
too
exciting
just
a
strait
forward
strong
belgian
blonde
lacking
nuance
and
depth
one
would
only
want
a
second
if
they
were
looking
for
an
easy
buzz
but
the
first
one
goes
down
very
easily
better
at
the
warmer
end
of
cellar
temp
indeed
a
waste
when
too
cold
d
good
beer
not
great
but
alright
afterthought
let
this
baby
warm
up
to
room
temperature
and
the
mouthfeel
will
gain
a
full
point
as
well
as
the
drinkability
not
a
very
grand
example
of
a
tripel
it
fails
to
what
it
aspires
to
i
let
this
bottle
sit
in
the
dbf
for
over
a
year
but
the
lack
of
freshness
actually
made
the
beer
more
interesting
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
huge
head
the
nose
is
yeasty
and
slightly
peppery
there
is
a
old
fruit
note
to
the
finish
which
adds
some
depth
to
the
tripel
not
as
complex
as
westmalle
but
still
worth
picking
up
this
is
a
tripel
that
needs
a
little
cellar
time
to
pick
up
the
nuances
a
bit
disappointing
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
much
better
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
thick
head
plenty
of
lace
sticks
to
the
glass
smells
almost
artificial
bananas
cloves
malts
and
medicinal
alcohol
first
taste
has
plenty
of
fruit
bananas
and
green
apples
bit
of
raw
sugar
as
well
however
its
ruined
by
the
taste
of
alcohol
its
not
good
alcohol
it
reminds
me
of
cheap
vodka
if
this
alcohol
were
gone
or
subdued
significantly
the
taste
score
would
be
at
least
a
4
but
this
cheap
vodka
taste
turns
me
off
mouthfeel
is
heavily
carbonated
a
bit
thick
and
sticky
has
great
potential
but
this
is
a
beer
i
will
not
be
seeking
out
again
note
this
was
part
of
the
global
beer
network
6
living
flanders
ales
6pack
expensive
but
an
awesome
opportunity
more
brewers
should
do
this
d
the
noticeable
alcohol
may
turn
some
off
very
aggressive
in
nature
and
at
times
distracts
from
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
like
it
smooth
and
dry
but
with
big
alcohol
nice
and
refreshing
for
a
tripel
there
are
others
that
can
substitute
this
ill
forget
about
this
one
and
remember
there
is
always
tomorrow
when
the
stubby
belgian
invite
continues
a
good
beer
worth
checking
out
not
the
best
offering
of
this
style
but
unique
nontheless
appearance
is
a
hazy
strawgolden
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
that
settles
nicely
into
a
thin
layer
obviously
moderately
carbonated
wonderful
estery
aromas
of
lemon
pear
and
apricot
blends
nicely
with
malts
that
remind
me
of
graham
crackers
moderate
hop
aroma
of
perfumy
and
flowery
hops
a
little
overwhelming
here
and
a
bit
solventlike
smell
in
the
background
is
noticeable
as
it
warms
velvety
mouthfeel
bursts
with
flavors
of
esters
like
what
was
found
in
the
aroma
but
once
again
there
is
a
bit
of
a
solventlike
hard
alcoholic
warmth
lurking
in
there
as
well
as
a
bit
of
a
vegetal
asparaguslike
flavor
rosy
hop
flavors
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
dont
quite
balance
the
malts
here
so
it
finishes
quite
sweet
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
more
because
it
had
great
complexity
in
flavor
and
aroma
but
there
were
some
offputting
flavors
and
aromas
plus
the
hops
didnt
quite
balance
the
sweetness
perhaps
it
was
just
this
bottle
so
i
would
definately
try
this
beer
again
with
most
elements
accounted
for
allbethey
underrepresented
this
is
working
towards
an
ideal
tripel
i
would
think
this
could
be
a
great
compliment
to
the
dinner
table
alongside
a
zesty
rose
pasta
sauce
might
i
suggest
but
i
fear
those
unfamiliar
with
the
style
might
be
turned
away
from
this
off
balanced
offering
id
certainly
stick
with
the
karmeliet
or
westmalle
to
name
only
two
of
belgiums
many
great
tripels
an
overall
good
tripel
tastes
more
like
a
bspa
than
a
tripel
but
ill
take
their
word
for
it
nice
offering
but
would
probably
go
with
a
duvel
if
given
the
choice
notes
this
is
a
very
good
triple
that
has
a
standout
flavor
that
i
really
enjoyed
sampled
on
41108
d
this
is
certainly
a
quality
belgian
ale
it
is
flavorful
yet
it
is
not
the
best
out
there
having
said
that
though
not
every
belgian
ale
can
be
the
best
belgian
ale
and
this
is
certainly
a
damn
fine
one
i
got
it
on
sale
in
a
sampler
pack
that
i
will
surely
purchase
again
if
the
sale
holds
runadamill
looks
on
this
triple
abbey
ale
nice
and
bright
and
energeticlooking
but
the
head
is
thin
and
quickly
dissipates
nose
is
full
of
chamomile
and
an
earthy
floweryness
a
bit
imbalanced
with
the
alcohol
and
thin
body
flavor
is
thin
and
onedimensional
in
the
mouth
although
there
is
a
generous
and
potent
malt
aftertaste
where
hops
do
not
dare
go
not
the
best
tripel
around
d
this
is
a
good
little
tripel
it
paired
very
well
with
my
meal
and
was
quite
easy
to
drink
despite
the
9
abv
i
hope
i
can
find
this
one
for
sale
at
a
store
instead
of
paying
10
50
for
it
at
the
restaurant
d
very
drinkable
the
body
of
this
beer
fully
covers
up
the
alcohol
content
i
think
this
should
be
rated
a
bit
higher
on
the
site
as
you
can
see
by
my
score
i
guess
its
not
the
best
tripel
in
the
world
but
it
has
some
ridiculous
competition
i
got
this
bottle
for
probably
half
the
price
of
a
westmalle
and
it
definitely
scratched
the
same
itch
p
s
this
came
as
part
of
a
belgian
taster
pack
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
decent

crisp
aroma
with
some
fruits
but
a
little
subtle
goes
down
very
smooth
flavor
is
clean
and
crisp
without
much
characteristic
other
than
the
same
subtle
fruits
there
is
the
warming
alcohol
at
the
finish
not
bad
i
got
a
six
pack
with
six
different
belgiums
and
this
was
one
of
them
pours
light
gold
very
carbonated
very
bubbly
head
that
sticks
around
fruity
smell
very
prevalent
citrus
flavor
a
little
overpowering
but
good
can
definitely
be
classified
as
very
refreshing
pours
out
to
quite
a
rocky
frothy
head
that
rushes
to
the
top
of
my
gobletleaves
fair
amount
of
lacing
around
the
glass
quite
good
head
retention
very
active
carbonation
is
apparent
beneath
this
white
cap
a
light
golden
colored
brew
smells
of
orangeapricotmusk
flavor
matches
the
smells
this
beer
exibits
a
much
stronger
aroma
profile
than
flavor
light
bodiedkind
of
bitter
and
refreshing
alcohol
is
well
hidden
tastes
and
feels
more
like
a
wit
rather
than
a
triple
i
have
to
mark
drinkability
quite
high
despite
any
other
shortcomings
with
the
abv
this
brew
is
quite
deceptively
easy
and
delicious
to
drink
still
waiting
for
someone
to
beat
duvel
in
the
belgian
beer
wars
though
d
the
aftertaste
makes
this
one
a
sipper
for
me
i
really
hate
that
is
dominates
the
entire
experience
di
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
triple
abbey
ale
before
and
i
like
it
dangerously
drinkable
at
9
0
abv
worth
savoring
but
goes
down
crisply
and
quickly
overall
id
say
its
definitely
worth
a
try
though
i
dont
see
myself
getting
this
too
often
poured
into
a
wine
goblet
decent
head
retention
cloudy
dark
gold
appearance
yeasty
aroma
but
missing
complexity
a
run
of
the
mill
belgian
tripel
quite
average
for
the
style
although
the
style
as
a
whole
is
such
strong
it
means
this
beer
is
still
pretty
tasty
9
abv
is
well
hidden
making
it
quite
drinkable
for
its
strength
decent
enough
tripel
but
nothing
im
coming
back
to
got
way
too
much
head
here
voluminous
head
ill
grant
you
but
still
the
amount
of
carbonation
reminded
me
of
champagne
being
popped
a
goldenpale
orange
body
that
had
a
very
citric
aroma
orange
and
pear
picked
up
mostly
the
taste
is
rather
earthy
not
too
fruity
and
it
wasnt
that
smooth
going
down
despite
a
medium
body
at
best
just
not
balanced
that
well
so
it
went
from
overly
dry
to
watery
at
some
points
and
there
was
even
a
metallic
twinge
on
the
backbite
when
i
finished
this
for
a
rather
roughish
beer
and
the
high
abv
i
will
stick
to
bornem
double
in
fact
if
i
am
looking
for
a
triple
i
will
probably
avoid
this
body
is
full
and
wellcarbonated
although
at
times
a
little
foamy
this
is
a
supertasty
belgian
ale
and
an
excellent
example
of
my
favorite
style
bottle
conditioned
from
the
lcbo
beautiful
frosted
gold
body
sits
underneath
a
large
rocky
white
head
which
eventually
diminishes
to
a
finger
aroma
of
alcohol
bananas
and
the
spices
associated
with
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
initially
full
of
these
spices
but
this
is
unfortunately
quickly
curtailed
by
a
predominance
of
grains
providing
the
long
finish
aggressive
carbonation
adds
nothing
but
unpleasantness
this
is
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
tripel
copped
from
garys
wine
in
madison
as
part
of
a
sixbeer
gift
pack
entitled
6
living
beers
of
the
world
this
short
fat
11
2
oz
bottle
packed
quite
a
subtle
punch
nice
golden
yellow
appearance
with
impressive
frothy
head
smell
was
typical
for
the
style
very
sweet
with
sugar
and
honey
hints
taste
was
very
good
full
of
esters
slight
alcohol
although
wellmasked
honey
sugars
and
slight
malts
very
goodflavored
rich
brew
that
really
satisfies
good
mouthfeel
and
equally
good
drinkability
even
for
a
9
abv
a
good
sample
definitely
recommended
this
is
not
my
favorite
trippel
by
a
long
mile
it
pours
a
very
nice
well
carbonated
somewhat
cloudy
orangish
yellow
the
head
is
prodigious
and
lasts
and
lasts
you
will
find
a
nice
soapy
frothy
head
that
mellows
to
just
a
fine
creamy
like
head
with
some
lacing
as
well
the
smell
is
all
yeast
lots
of
citrusy
smells
musty
a
bit
perfumy
but
quite
subtle
on
the
whole
this
beer
is
exceptionally
well
carbonated
and
you
will
see
the
efforvesence
streaming
upwards
for
the
duration
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
plenty
of
yeasty
backbone
and
a
very
dry
bone
dry
character
the
taste
is
characteristically
belgian
in
that
you
will
get
that
nice
yeasty
dry
bite
whats
lacking
is
the
candied
sugar
consistency
the
fruity
notes
more
citrus
in
the
finish
and
a
more
full
body
overall
this
beer
does
improve
as
it
settles
and
is
an
okay
foray
into
the
style
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
belgian
trippel
pours
a
golden
cloudy
color
with
some
head
smell
is
distinct
with
a
acidic
citrus
edge
taste
starts
off
with
a
deep
malty
flavor
and
then
moves
on
to
a
bit
of
alcohol
there
is
a
lasting
flavor
that
stays
with
you
but
nothing
that
i
feel
is
worth
going
back
to
van
steenberge
makes
some
interesting
brews
i
think
but
i
cant
say
i
appreciate
the
bornem
labels
that
much
not
bad
just
not
great
taste
is
estery
and
fruity
lots
of
exotic
fruits
from
all
sorts
pineapple
mango
lychees
etc
malt
is
not
very
present
it
has
a
very
light
body
that
is
dominated
by
the
yeast
products
besides
that
a
lot
of
sugar
has
been
added
to
control
body
and
drinkability
a
bit
too
and
solventy
thin
for
me
but
this
seems
to
be
the
case
in
a
lot
of
tripels
not
one
id
recommend
the
taste
is
clean
and
refreshing
notes
of
herbs
spices
fruits
some
sweetness
and
a
good
hoppy
finish
just
a
bit
to
thin
and
carbonated
on
the
mouthfeel
for
me
this
smells
surprisingly
like
cheap
beer
i
dont
know
what
causes
that
please
enlighten
me
if
you
do
know
upon
another
deep
whiff
i
get
more
of
the
characteristic
belgian
aroma
but
this
is
subordinate
to
the
other
odor
the
taste
is
a
little
thin
bodied
with
malts
combining
with
sourness
it
definitely
tastes
like
a
tripel
but
something
is
a
little
off
about
it
its
still
fairly
drinkable
though
and
not
too
bad
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
a
belgian
candy
sugar
and
somewhat
fruity
in
the
taste
a
dry
yeasty
fruit
kind
of
white
grapeish
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
fruity
aftertaste
an
easy
drinking
triple
sweet
and
dry
in
all
the
right
places
tried
a
bottle
thanks
to
ebenezers
in
maine
pleasant
yeast
and
sour
aroma
it
looks
more
like
a
hefeweisen
than
a
triple
when
poured
creamy
head
the
slight
sourness
is
in
the
flavor
of
the
beer
as
well
its
also
sweet
with
strong
floral
and
honey
notes
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
more
like
a
golden
ale
than
a
triple
id
like
to
learn
more
about
this
brewer
pours
a
hazy
golden
copper
with
a
massive
threefinger
white
head
highly
carbonated
with
tiny
bubbles
constantly
rising
to
the
top
lacing
left
through
the
finish
aroma
is
slightly
malty
sweet
with
a
little
spicyness
and
herbal
hop
smells
taste
is
sweet
up
front
eith
a
nice
bitter
balance
and
a
subtle
hoppy
grassy
note
light
and
thin
on
the
tongue
and
dry
with
a
nice
carbonated
bite
alcohol
flavor
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
if
it
werent
9
abv
and
10
a
bottle
i
could
probably
drink
a
couple
of
these
comment
this
is
a
surprising
trippel
i
thought
i
was
prepared
after
reading
a
review
or
two
but
i
did
not
expect
to
be
taken
off
guard
i
have
been
sampling
a
few
trippels
lately
and
this
falls
on
the
far
end
of
the
curve
it
will
not
be
my
standard
but
it
will
be
in
my
collection
d
this
one
is
very
drinkable
despite
the
big
alcohol
flavors
and
everpresent
sweetness
this
is
a
very
honeyheavy
desert
brew
for
the
summer
months
that
would
go
great
with
some
fruity
and
light
deserts
this
is
a
very
good
triple
the
only
item
of
dislike
i
have
for
it
is
the
overly
fizzy
carbonation
seriously
its
so
much
like
soda
at
least
in
the
beginning
that
i
had
to
sip
it
super
slow
in
order
to
dig
into
the
deep
layers
of
flavor
11
2
oz
bottle
color
of
light
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
nose
of
yeast
honey
red
apples
lavender
and
slight
sourness

taste
of
honey
yeast
and
cider
body
is
medium
slightly
acidic
and
with
mediumhigh
carbonation

aftertaste
of
sugar
cane
yeast
cobwebs
honey
and
orange
peel
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
sweetness
balances
the
sweetness
fairly
well
and
the
alcohol
is
almost
completely
hidden
the
dubbel
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
so
im
happy
that
the
tripel
was
nice
md
effervescent
almost
fiercely
fizzy
on
the
palate
due
to
the
abundant
carbonation
retaining
this
intensity
for
a
very
long
time
but
the
body
is
feather
light
for
a
9
pale
ale
thus
extremely
drinkable
i
especially
appreciate
the
dry
palate
which
distinguishes
it
from
many
other
more
malty
and
sweet
version
of
tripel
this
is
a
quality
thirstquenching
artisan
pale
ale
imo
pours
with
a
strong
effervescent
and
a
rapidly
depleting
white
head
strong
bubbling
continues
from
the
bottom
of
the
goblet
maintain
a
few
islands
of
head
yeast
as
expected
from
a
belgium
dominates
the
nose
with
wheat
notes
tarter
and
farmhouse
characteristics
rounding
things
out
while
the
nose
disappoints
the
flavor
makes
up
some
ground
with
the
farmhouse
smell
resulting
in
a
more
restrained
farm
taste
the
tart
flavor
has
a
little
oxidization
probably
from
sitting
too
long
on
a
shelf
the
finish
is
clean
leaving
a
slight
vinegar
flavor
lingering
this
beer
has
less
mouthfeel
and
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
expect
from
this
style
drinkability
after
trying
a
bottle
that
did
not
age
well
in
my
cellar
i
bought
a
fresh
one
today
and
was
glad
i
did
while
this
beer
is
not
your
classic
tripel
it
is
very
good
and
well
worth
seeking
out
a
warning
however
that
the
tart
flavors
do
not
age
well
this
beer
poured
a
yellowgolden
color
with
a
huge
head

nice
retention
the
aroma
is
mainly
sour
the
taste
is
grainy
and
sour
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
somewhat
light
im
having
trouble
deciding
about
the
drinkablity
of
this
beer
but
it
does
seem
to
grow
on
me
d
this
triple
was
surprisingly
light
easy
to
drink
despite
the
9
gravity
but
the
flavor
didnt
bring
it
home
all
the
way
a
very
nice
beer
pours
a
clearslightly
cloudy
pale
gold
and
orange
the
head
is
large
and
foamybut
leaves
almost
no
lacing
and
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
average
with
applecandy
sugar
and
some
alcohol
the
taste
is
crisp
with

belgian

the
taste
is
subpar

the

really
dont

ok

nothing

all
that
complex

damn
lovely

matches
but
at
a
lesser
degree
nice

bubbly
very
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
most
tripels
ive
had
but
the
taste
is
perhaps
lacking
a
bit
pale
straw
yellow
hue
with
a
nice
1
12
finger
head
in
a
chimay
glass
thins
to
a
nice
foamy
cap
fairly
quickly
first
smell
is
all
citrus
zest
at
first
which
is
followed
by
some
mild
spiceyness
as
it
warms
the
smell
picks
up
some
banana
notes
also
taste
is
mildly
citrus
up
front
but
not
near
what
i
picked
up
in
smell
followed
by
some
maltyness
and
finishing
with
some
pepper
slightly
overcarbonated
finishes
dry

is
well
hidden
overall
worth
a
try
a
massive
white
monsterous
thick

extreme
amounts
of
carbonation
aroma
is
a
wheaty
banana
smell
along
with
the
typical
belgian
aroma
the
color
is
a
hazy

it
has
a
unfiltered
wheat
beer
look
to
it
fizzy
alcoholic
mouthfeel
with
a
medicinallike
finish
wellhidden
9
abv
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
the
taste
isnt
too
complex
with
the
high
amounts
of
fizz
detracting
from
it
slight
lingering
bitterness
with
a
dryness
after
each
sip
sediment
left
in
the
bottle
very
drinkable
for
a
strong
but
surprisingly
light
beer
spicey
sweet
and
light
malts
with
a
medium
body
overly
carbonated
making
it
hard
to
pour
and
drink
it
doesnt
matter
how
gentle
you
pour
it
a
huge
glass
filling

will
result
after
about
a
five
minute
wait
the
head
will
reduce
and
enable
you
to
drink
leaves
scattered
amounts
of
thick
lace
no
real
issues
with
finishing
the
bottle
but
just
a
very
average
tripel
overall
dont
be
afraid
to
try
it
just
dont
expect
very
much
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
when
it
dissipated
the
color
is
lighter
than
most
tripels
the
smell
is
sweet
not
a
candi
sugar
sweet
but
kind
of
a
floral
citrus
sweet
the
taste
is
a
bit
lemony
citrus
and
finishes
tart
granny
smith
apple
the
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
fizzy
and
finishes
quite
dry
kind
of
an
odd
tripel
doesnt
have
many
of
the
characteristics
that
i
am
used
to
not
bad
but
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
not
an
everyday
beer
but
its
still
a
lighter
abbey
ale
perhaps
the
perfect
introduction
to
the
stronger
belgian
offerings
drinkability
nice
drinkability
nice
balance
for
a
tripel
drinkability
about
what
you
would
expect
from
a
belgian
tripple
failry
easy
to
drink
albiet
flavorful
drinkability
for
a
tripel
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
a
warning
definitely
must
go
out
to
the
uninformed
sweet
fruity
aromas
cinnamon
citrus
a
touch
of
tanginess
in
the
air
fizzy
then
later
creamy
mouthfeel
taste
is
multidimensional
with
lots
going
on
sweet
fruitiness
and
a
bitter
backbone
then
an
underlying
sourness
or
tartness
that
brings
white
grapefruit
to
mind
at
first
the
sour
notes
are
welcome
as
time
goes
on
the
finish
is
a
touch
too
bitter
all
in
all
a
very
nice
belgian
tripel
volume
9
overall
its
easy
to
drink
and
satisfyingly
flavorful
pungent
and
stinky
in
the
winter
time
it
make
me
nose
and
fingers
tingly
my
only
major
complaint
is
this
brew
is
a
little
overcarbonated
and
that
negatively
affects
its
drinkability
aside
from
that
however
its
not
a
bad
beer
worth
a
try

this
is
a
little

much
carbonation
for
my
taste
and
i
can
taste
almost
pure
alcohol
with
every
sip
i
realize
that
at
9
its
no
lightweight
but
youd
think
the
bold
spiciness
could
cover
the
alcohol
better
than
it
does
smacked
in
the
face
with
citrus
right
away
quite
bitter
but
very
refreshing
at
the
same
time
smell
was
of
grapefruit
and
honey
had
a
real
lemon
kick
to
it
too
and
i
could
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
as
well
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
like
but
a
good
triple
none
the
less
pair
with
a
good
cheese
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
id
recommend
a
smoked
gouda
d
not
my
favorite
i
guess
i
like
my
tripels
a
little
less
bitter
and
more
fruity
i
think
its
a
little
bit
on
the
harsh
side
and
not
so
smooth
maybe
could
benefit
by
decanting
before
drinking
notes
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
id
rather
pay
a
bit
more
and
get
more
flavor
this
could
be
a
good
brew
for
those
new
to
the
style
and
looking
to
ease
into
its
qualities
golden
yellow
somewhat
clear
body
with
several
fingers
thick
white
head
smells
sweet
and
citrussy
tons
of
lacing
tastes
citrussy
for
the
most
part
kind
of
yeasty
as
well
tasty
very
drinkable
medium
in
body
a
solid
tripel
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
light
straw
tinged
gold
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
descends
into
a
tight
white
compact
head
with
great
staying
power
the
nose
is
interesting
there
are
some
apple
aromas
in
there
but
theyve
been
morphed
into
something
applealcoholic
like
the
apple
aromas
you
find
in
calvados
or
cognac
theres
also
some
pepper
some
yeast
and
a
bit
of
fruity
bubblegum
in
the
nose
on
the
palate
light
sweetness
up
front
tart
apples
next
and
then
the
palate
flattens
out
a
bit
until
the
finish
with
has
slightly
sour
fruits
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
acidic
on
the
malt
side
with
big
carbonation
that
provides
some
snap
but
less
volume
than
i
expected
overall
this
is
a
good
tripel
with
some
interesting
aromatic
notes
and
less
interesting
tastes
that
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
best
of
the
style
but
nonetheless
has
its
charms
nice
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
however
the
alcohol
comes
through
as
this
goes
down
and
lingers
and
i
sip
it
pours
into
the
goblet
clear
supercarbonated
pale
straw
one
finger
of
tight
creamy
head
and
light
lacing
smells
of
tannic
lemons
lime
zest
black
pepper
and
yeast
a
bit
acidic
on
the
nose
for
a
tripel
flavors
are
tough
to
pin
down
consistently
since
they
change
rapidly
starts
with
coarse
black
pepper
and
hops
develops
rounded
sweet
lemon
fruitiness
and
finishes
with
more
hops
peppery
sourness
powdery
yeast
and
warming
alcohol
highly
spritzed
medium
body
a
pretty
nice
tripel
overall
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
at
the
same
level
decent
body
decent
flavor
overall
a
nice
beer
d
i
like
this
definitely
worth
a
try
but
not
a
paragon
of
the
style
while
its
not
bad
per
se
it
is
actually
rather
boring
it
just
doesnt
have
anything
that
holds
the
attention
and
with
the
sinewy
abv
the
nondescript
nature
conspires
to
keep
consumption
to
a
minimum
bornem
boredom
coincidence
perhaps
not

special
from

a
non
too
attractive
hazy
yellow
looks
slightly
greenish
might
be
lighting
smells
a
bit
citrusy
and
like
dried
fruit
tastes
a
bit
stonger
like
the
smell
slightly
more
bitterness
with
the
citrus
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
at
all
overall
its
allright
i
need
to
find
some
belgiums
that
would
get
me
excited
though
this
is
just
ok
bornem
tripel
is
a
better
than
decent
version
of
my
favorite
belgian
style
that
doesnt
come
close
to
cracking
my
top10
that
said
im
still
having
a
great
time
drinking
it
and
am
disappointed
to
discover
that
the
bottle
is
empty
and
my
glass
is
nearly
so
as
long
as
you
dont
expect
it
to
be
worldclass
this
one
is
worth
the
purchase
price
watching
the
pour
it
was
so
clear
it
looked
like
water
in
the
glass
its
like
a
field
of
dried
wheat
the
bright
white
head
is
tall
and
has
staying
power
smells
a
little
grassy
tastes
wheaty
kinda
hefeweizenesque
i
hadnt
put
one
in
but
i
swear
that
i
tasted
lemon
little
bit
bitter
on
the
tongue
quite
drinkable
the
high
alcohol
level
goes
right
to
the
head
oelergud
if
you
just
pour
this
one
into
your
glass
and
just
look
at
it
and
smell
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
sadly
the
flavor
isnt
all
too
hot
very
drinkable
but
there
are
many
other
triples
i
prefer
cheers
this
triple
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
from
the
bottle
a
large
foamy
head
arises
and
stays
around
for
some
time
the
smell
is
malty
yeasty
and
fruity
the
taste
parallels
the
smell
a
realy
nice
belgian
no
unmasked
alcohol
so
beware
the
ensuing
buzz
enjoy

a

with
a
huge
head
that
stayed
for
a
long
time
with
a
temendous
amount
of
lace
as
well
nice
hop
aroma
with
apple
and
pear
notes
smells
crisp
and
has
a
subtle
yeast
nose
fruity
and
yeast
flavors
and
not
as
hoppy
as
the
nose
indicates
sweet
caramel
malt
has
a
definate
presence
very
dry
and
a
bit
tart
seems
a
bit
harsh
which
reduces
drinkability
an
ok
triple
but
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
got
this
in
a
gift
pack
and
from
this
tasting
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
on
its
own
but
hey
ill
try
anything
twice
just
to
make
sure
well
almost
anything
im
trying
to
sip
this
ale
without
smelling
it
everything
about
this
beer
is
repulsive
unbearable
not
overly
drinkable
but
not
bad
either
from
notes
poured
a
very
clear
straw
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
fell
to
a
full
coat
over
the
brew
nose
was
very
sweet
almost
with
cidery
notes
with
a
light
lemon
zestyness
and
light
folden
raisiney
fruityness
and
just
a
puff
of
alcohol
behind
it
flavor
was
strong
on
the
fruity
notes
with
a
lighter
lemon
and
orange
spiceynesszestyness
the
alcohol
came
through
moderately
the
body
was
moderate
with
a
very
active
carbonation
keeping
it
feeling
very
spritely
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
brew
the
alcohol
was
present
but
not
at
all
offensive
not
bad
at
all
d
light
crisp
and
very
digestible
although
its
a
little
gassy
before
you
even
pour
the
champagne
smell
hits
you
pours
a
nice
murky
light
color
like
a
whitbier
and
the
champagne
smell
hits
you
again
runaway
head
with
big
bubbles
that
lasts
for
the
whole
drink
taste
yields
to
the
champagne
smell
after
a
few
sips
and
you
find
some
wheatale
taste
that
is
very
dry
and
bitter
doesnt
try
to
hide
the
fact
that
its
a
trippel
though
im
amazed
that
the
1
increase
over
its
dubbel
brother
is
so
pronounced
by
itself
its
a
bit
strict
and
clean
but
i
imagine
this
would
be
brilliant
with
any
food
that
takes
well
to
clean
acidic
white
wines
like
pinot
blanc
clear
gold
with
an
enormous
white
head
good
head
retention
with
a
little
clumpy
lacing
lemon
zest
and
apples
complement
the
light
bready
and
spicy
aromas
sugary
sweet
theres
some
balancing
bitterness
and
a
floralherbal
hop
kick
towards
the
end
citrus
and
pear
along
with
alcohol
round
out
the
flavours
lingering
warmth
and
dry
bitterness
that
blends
nicely
with
the
fruit
character
high
carbonation
light
body
alcohol
is
part
of
the
character
but
is
restrained
throughout
enjoyable
this
ale
poured
very
nicely
with
alot
of
lacing
and
thick
head
it
is
golden
yellow
in
color
and
is
very
carbonated
smells
of
fruit
and
wine
or
almost
champagne
like
tastes
as
it
smells
like
a
bubbly
wine
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
it
loses
some
of
the
bubbliness
is
that
a
word
but
becomes
more
drinkable
in
my
opinion
one
can
taste
the
high
alcohol
content
if
that
may
be
a
positive
or
a
negative
thing
depending
on
taste
purchased
in
a
mixed
holiday
6
pack
at
the
lcbo
in
sarnia
ontario
the
pour
is
golden
in
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
cap
that
disipates
quickly
the
fizz
is
big
very
effervescent
champagne
like
nose
is
dominated
by
the
honeyyeasty
tones
flavor
is
sweet
honey
but
light
body
is
light
probably
due
to
the
fizz
very
nice
i
dont
mind
intense
beers
so
long
as
theyre
good
enough
to
deserve
to
let
me
let
them
rape
my
pallet
this
one
not
that
great
i
could
get
it
down
and
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
but
it
really
could
be
taken
down
a
notch
or
two
poured
golden
and
bubbly
massive
head
on
this
one
at
first
that
shriks
to
14
inch
smells
pretty
good
with
some
pear
banana
and
alcohol
as
well
as
some
other
sweet
citrus
like
smells
taste
is
citrusy
and
alcoholic
also
kinda
spicy
and
hoppy
medium
thin
mouthfeel
seems
pretty
drinkable
but
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
taste
still
a
very
good
beer
though
also
9
abv
makes
it
quite
a
pleasant
tasting
id
stay
at
their
abbey
any
day
as
long
as
they
served
these
strong
ales
not
the
best
tripel
heavily
laden
with
alcohol
and
onedimensional
overall
a
solid
tripel
that
i
definitely
recommend
at
9
this
brew
goes
down
pretty
smooth
however
all
in
all
this
isnt
as
complex
as
i
was
expecting
taste
light
in
body
but
high
in
octane
ive
never
actually
drank
paint
thinner
before
but
i
have
a
feeling
it
woulod
be
similar
to
this
maybe
this
style
didnt
do
it
for
me
but
i
thought
it
was
a
little
unidimentional
you
got
to
bring
something
else
than
just
moonshine
if
you
want
to
get
me
to
like
a
tripel
drinkability
is
good
on
this
tasty
tripel
alcohol
was
hidden
well
in
the
begining
but
became
more
noticable
as
it
warmed
d
would
match
up
with
fish
or
poultry
beautifully
wouldnt
work
as
a
session
beer
and
at
the
price
youd
be
foolish
to
use
it
as
such
all
things
considered
a
very
good
tripel
i
would
have
again
if
the
price
werent
so
steep
overall
an
ok
tripel
worth
a
try
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there

taste

lighly
malty
with
a
lingering
yeast
common
in
a
tripel
i
enjoy
the
yeasty
tastes
and
tripels
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
it
may
be
a
bit
musty
for
some
a
little
more
carbonated
than
most
but
not
horribly
so
very
drinkable
and
tasty
there
are
better
but
this
is
pretty
damn
good

alcohol
is
hardly
noticed
a
nice
tripple
from
a
sampler
picked
up
at
halftime
this
beer
produced
a
huge
frothy
white
head
the
color
was
hazy
sunshine
yellow
and
with
light
yellow
lights
abundant
lacing
left
as
beer
was
consumed
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
yeasty
also
very
floral
with
hints
of
sweet
fruit
cherries
the
taste
had
a
slight
sourness
and
was
very
fruity
with
good
sweet
malts
and
slight
sweetness
like
ripe
berries
there
was
dehfinitely
some
alcohol
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
abundant
carbonation
this
was
a
decent
trippel
will
have
to
buy
again
drinkable
if
you
must
however
this
was
way
off
my
expectations
chart
and
not
off
the
good
way
drinkability
super
tasty
beer
that
still
tastes
like
a
saison
to
me
if
its
a
tripel
its
the
most
different
tripel
ive
ever
had
its
still
damn
good
though
and
for
the
1
99
i
paid
for
it
last
year
going
to
have
to
track
some
more
of
these
down
as
i
excepted
the
alchohol
is
up
front
in
the
taste
of
this
big
trip
still
very
drinkable
though
a
bit
sugary
and
fruity
with
a
nice
little
hop
bite
this
is
probably
not
one
that
i
would
want
to
let
warm
better
drink
it
up
quick
d
good
beer
just
the
price
of
the
beer
knocking
the
drinkability
around
a
bit
a
good
beer
but
for
4
bucks
a
stubie
in
la
i
will
pass
from
the
belgium
sampler
pack
cloudy
amber
with
a
large
spit
head
that
fades
slowly
alcohol
nose
with
some
sort
of
sweet
juicy
fruity
scent
taste
is
slightly
tangy
almost
like
a
grape
juice
with
a
hint
of
licorice
watery
mouthfeel
with
vague
bitter
aftertaste
very
smooth
and
drinkable
id
say
its
a
decent
but
not
exceptional
beer
9
abv
is
impressive
and
is
not
especially
noticeable
the
taste
is
quite
frothy
the
carbonation
fizzes
up
as
the
beer
hits
my
tongue
that
same
interesting
note
that
is
in
the
aroma
is
found
in
the
taste
as
well
the
beer
is
sharp
and
a
bit
herbal
with
notes
of
vanilla
a
hint
of
bergamot
the
beer
is
quite
light
on
the
palate
but
has
a
sort
of
lingering
not
quite
astringent
finish
to
it
there
is
a
bit
of
hot
alcohol
in
the
finish
and
the
nose
too
that
starts
to
assert
itself
a
bit
more
as
the
beer
warms
up
there
are
lots
of
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
in
this
beer
but
it
just
does
not
quite
seem
to
mesh
for
me
i
found
this
to
be
a
great
triple
with
a
lot
of
subtle
character
appears
a
light
orange
tan
color
with
a
large
bubbly
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
sweet
honey
herbal
hops
and
a
pale
malt
backbone
taste
is
much
the
same
herbally
hoppy
and
strong
on
the
pale
malt
with
some
nice
mildly
sweet
tones
and
also
a
really
milky
quality
out
front
which
makes
the
beer
in
my
opinion
excellent
smooth
mouthfeel
refreshing
without
being
light
this
is
a
great
belgian
in
my
opinion
impression
a
nice
tripple
flavors
are
a
bit
assertive
probably
from
lack
of
aging
balance
is
just
off
but
i
am
being
picky
drinkability
is
very
high
a
really
good
tripel
from
a
fine
brewery
ill
gladly
have
this
one
again
draught
this
one
pours
an
almost
clear
straw
yellow
color
from
this
you
could
tell
almost
immediately
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
tripel
light
there
was
some
head
to
it
but
not
too
much
the
aroma
was
a
little
light
with
mainly
components
of
spicy
banana
and
yeastiness
some
alcohol
to
the
taste
the
body
was
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
good
but
trending
to
the
lower
half
of
the
style
stubbie

yeasthop
taste
very
simple
monolithic
taste
profile
with
a
yeasty
wet
finish
very
drinkable
if
this
is
any
representation
of
the
style
but
personally
if
i
wanted
to
get
a
peach
flavored
drink
to
get
gooned
on
id
order
double
peach
daqs
and
attain
the
same
result
while
it
doesnt
offer
much
complexity
this
is
a
very
drinkable
triple
i
bought
this
as
part
of
a
sixpack
sampler
and
this
is
the
first
bottle
that
i
broke
into
the
beer
pours
out
yellowgold
and
forms
a
substancial
white
fluffy
head
with
carbonation
rising
from
bottom
right
to
the
last
drop
the
smell
is
mildly
citrusy
with
hints
of
green
apple
and
malt
maybe
even
swiss
cheese
though
nothing
jumps
right
out
at
me
sipped
the
carbonation
dances
on
the
tongue
with
a
hint
of
raisin
the
aftertase
reminds
me
of
champagne
its
a
good
beer
and
id
certainly
buy
more
though
personally
this
isnt
my
favorite
triple
now
if
youll
excuse
me
i
just
may
have
another
poured
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
light
fluffy
white
head
and
wonderful
lacing
aroma
of
apples
peaches
and
lots
of
malt
taste
was
sweet
fruity
and
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
hits
you
as
you
finish
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
excellent
light
and
bubbly
almost
champagne
like
deceptive
alcohol
ok
beer
but
lacking
depth
and
flavour
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
this
is
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
in
moderation
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
overall
an
enjoyable
belgian
to
have
with
dinner
or
a
snack
not
the
best
tripel
but
worth
trying
drinkability
the
flavor
does
not
do
it
for
me
i
like
tripels
but
not
this
one
pretty
good
if
unremarkable
example
of
the
style
poured
into
a
goblet
it
pours
an
orangish
yellow
not
enough
head
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
taste
is
slightly
spicy
a
little
fruity
slightly
hoppy
alcohol
is
definitely
present
as
well
their
dubbel
is
much
better
in
my
opinion
and
theres
a
lot
of
better
tripels
out
there
average
at
best
not
something
id
put
in
my
top
5
tripels
but
reliable
and
a
perfect
exercise
in
the
style
for
sure
recommended
this
is
a
good
beer
i
love
tripels
after
all
and
you
could
do
worse
but
there
are
others
that
are
so
much
better
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
frothy
1
bright
white
head
over
the
golden
brew
which
is
awhirl
with
carbonation
head
lasts
and
lasts
with
heavy
foam
lacing
aroma
is
spicy
yet
sweet
as
one
would
expect
from
a
belgian
tripel
taste
is
slightly
spicy
belgian
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
fruity
sourness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
one
of
the
most
approachable
tripels
i
have
run
across
light
hazy
yellow
pour
with
a
thick
fat
white
head
on
the
top
head
give
way
to
a
decent
lace
that
has
an
island
of
fat
foam
in
the
middle
aroma
is
a
mix
of
a
musty
yeast
but
tones
of
apple
and
lemon
flavor
is
sweet
from
malt
and
tones
of
light
fruit
mixed
in
you
can
even
get
hints
of
some
spices
mixed
in
the
alcohol
was
nicely
hidden
in
the
flavor
an
average
mouth
feel
and
ok
on
the
drinkability
honestly
this
brew
reminded
me
of
a
wit
on
steroids
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
triple
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
weak
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
areas
there
are
better
out
there
overall
average
this
beer
produced
a
huge
foamy
head
with
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
going
down
the
color
was
opaque
and
straw
hued
the
smell
is
of
malt
with
hints
of
lemon
and
what
i
can
only
describe
as
straw
the
taste
was
spicy
maltybready
and
contained
a
hint
of
lemon
bitterness
towards
the
end
it
felt
good
in
the
mouth
and
left
a
nice
coating
with
each
draught
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
the
smell
strongly
alcoholized
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
malts
beyond
a
larger
feel
of
citrus
a
bit
fruity
as
well
the
taste
definetly
not
all
that
sweet
but
rather
stingy
at
first
gradually
progressing
to
a
considerable
bitterness
while
showing
a
considerably
complex
range
in
between
slightly
malty
and
fruity
and
the
alcohol
a
permanent
item
in
the
background
alongside
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
enhancing
it
the
body
wasnt
as
full
as
id
expect
a
tripel
to
be
seemed
a
bit
watery
but
still
quite
pleasant
a
strong
gold
body
is
topped
by
a
sizeable
white
head
this
one
doesnt
boom
like
the
one
on
the
dubbel
did
instead
it
pours
to
a
couple
of
fingers
and
then
when
you
turn
to
rinse
out
the
bottle
it
grows
up
to
fill
the
glass
and
more
to
stand
stifly
in
meringue
peaks
above
the
rim
the
aroma
is
slightly
weak
theres
a
bit
of
hay
maltiness
and
a
vague
herbal
quality
that
could
almost
pass
for
dried
garlic
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
esters
but
theyre
faint
compared
to
the
dubbel
the
flavor
is
much
drier
than
the
dubbel
but
lacks
the
complex
fruitiness
of
the
darker
beer
easy
drinking
but
a
little
boring
giving
a
nice
head
are
again
a
total
clear
beer
and
that
for
botle
fermentation
only
a
litle
protein
haze
always
the
same
with
beers
from
van
steenberge
and
have
to
say
for
that
the
used
botle
yeast
is
damm
good
for
arome
dont
know
not
too
much
there
kind
of
a
pilsener
smell
nothing
wrong
but
nothing
great
in
it
too
some
fruit
less
malt
and
is
there
any
hops
all
in
all
alcohol
dominates
in
this
smell
clean
and
again
empty
taste
and
ending
dry
with
some
hanging
bitterness
and
again
alcohol
this
must
bring
the
feeling
fast
but
nothing
i
go
for
again
33cl
bottle
poured
with
afluffy
pillowy
head
with
a
pale
yeloow
color
lemony
citrusy
aroma
with
some
spicy
pepper
and
alcohol
good
amount
of
co2
in
the
taste
that
cleanses
the
palate
a
little
to
well
driving
away
all
taste
of
the
malt
or
hops
in
this
i
just
get
a
bit
of
citrus
followed
by
alcohol
yeah
you
can
drink
this
and
its
worth
a
shot
to
pick
one
up
if
you
see
but
in
my
mind
its
nothing
special
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
sautee
some
shellfish
or
salmon
in
ill
definitely
be
having
more
of
these
it
is
a
good
tripel
and
i
would
never
refuse
one
but
i
certainly
like
the
other
tripels
from
the
brewer
better
than
this
one
this
tripel
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
colour
with
a
tinge
of
green
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
but
not
as
thick
as
their
dubbel
aroma
was
spicy
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
something
sweet
almost
like
grenadine
taste
was
surprising
rather
sweet
cherries
with
some
tartness
as
well
less
spicy
than
your
average
tripel
but
very
tasty
and
warming
had
a
rather
sparkling
mouthfeel
which
makes
it
seem
quite
light
starting
to
really
like
this
brewery
this
tripel
has
a
really
great
label
design
it
pours
an
orange
yellow
glow
through
the
haze
the
head
is
massive
billowy
and
ice
cream
like
in
its
consistency
it
leaves
sheets
of
chunky
lace
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
mandarins
marashino
cherries
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
very
fruity
with
a
good
belgian
yeast
character
lots
of
citrusy
hops
are
preasant
the
finish
is
sweet
and
somewhat
alcoholy
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
slick
this
is
a
very
tastey
citrusy
and
tart
tripel
its
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
bornem
dubbel
this
beer
is
in
a
short
little
bottle
when
you
pour
it
it
takes
at
least
2
attempts
to
fill
the
bottle
with
the
massive
amounts
of
head
there
is
very
good
head
retention
but
nothing
like
that
of
ara
beir
after
a
while
the
head
diminishes
to
about
14
of
an
inch
the
beer
itself
is
a
cloudy
tan
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
sweet
but
i
cannot
tell
what
it
is
from
i
have
a
slight
cold
the
first
thing
i
notice
when
i
drink
this
beer
is
how
dry
it
finishes
its
almost
like
drinking
a
dry
cabernet
in
comparison
with
a
viney
taste
to
it
there
is
a
definite
warming
from
the
alcohol
i
dont
know
if
ill
be
drinking
this
again
as
there
are
many
more
better
belgiums
available
not
that
ive
ever
listened
to
her
pours
a
very
pale
and
clear
gold
huge
white
head
and
incredibly
lacy
smell
is
spicy
and
lightly
fruity
taste
is
also
lightly
fruity
and
peppery
somewhat
dry
not
very
assertive
in
any
partucular
flavor
dry
in
the
mouth
and
a
bit
light
on
the
palate
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
flavor
from
a
tripel
it
not
bad
does
not
offend
doesnt
impress
much
either
not
boring
but
not
one
to
recommend
either
definitely
an
interesting
and
complex
beer
but
not
something
ill
be
buying
again
anytime
soon
because
of
the
somewhat
harshspicy
character
id
rather
have
a
whitecap
chimay
overall
as
with
the
dubbel
this
has
allegedly
been
brewed
since
the
early
1970s
for
the
st
bernardus
abbey
of
bornem
it
is
rumored
that
the
monks
could
fast
on
this
beer
for
40
days
so
beer
really
is
food
it
seems
cost
a
greenback
more
than
the
dubbel
at
8
99
i
found
it
to
be
worth
the
sterlingeuros
but
only
just
a
tasty
and
solid
triple
that
is
pushing
the
value
for
money
boundary
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
ale
house
nyc
always
interestind
in
trying
a
new
belgian
i
gave
this
one
a
go
pours
very
light
dull
yellowish
and
cloudy
well
deeloped
white
head
leaves
nicely
developed
lacing
nose
was
lemony
and
fresh
this
beer
was
suprisingly
light
and
thin
for
a
triple
notes
of
lemons
wheat
sort
of
like
a
creamsicle
finished
crisp
and
tart
not
my
favorite
triple
seemed
more
like
a
tart
wheat
beer
of
course
it
was
pleasant
and
very
drinkable
to
hold
its
own
as
a
triple
they
would
need
to
kick
up
the
malt
bill
add
some
more
candi
sugarspices
and
yeast
phenolics
this
beer
hit
me
just
right
i
was
getting
ready
to
do
some
home
repairs
but
wanted
to
quench
my
thirst
and
thats
exactly
what
this
brew
did
first
it
had
a
rich
thick
head
beautiful
lacing
and
a
cloudy
lemon
appearance
excellent
smell
was
mainly
lemon
but
extremely
inviting
taste
was
citrus
tart
and
inviting
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
dry
right
near
my
top
for
this
category
for
a
9
abv
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
nothing
heavy
duty
or
industrial
strength
here
to
overwhelm
the
senses
just
a
dandy
example
of
a
solid
belgian
tripel
that
is
an
easy
and
fine
sipping
ale
very
pleasant
and
significantly
better
than
their
dubbel
hazy
white
gold
in
hue
dull
in
appearance
minimal
animation
is
noticeable
the
head
was
a
very
bright
white
in
color
it
is
stark
in
contrast
to
the
color
of
the
liquid
at
the
apex
the
head
was
almost
three
fingers
in
height
retention
was
decent
it
slid
fairly
quickly
to
a
modest
cap
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
it
is
not
a
stellar
looking
beer
the
nose
is
alcoholic
it
is
a
bit
much
while
i
wouldnt
call
this
aspect
of
the
bouquet
harsh
it
is
fairly
unpleasant
dry
white
wine
aromas
traces
of
herbs
and
marshmallows
with
some
lemongrass
as
well
at
the
back
there
is
a
slight
level
of
solvent
overall
the
potency
is
modest
at
best
it
is
too
low
for
me
couple
this
with
the
fact
the
construction
isnt
great
it
does
say
triple
but
it
doesnt
sell
me
on
that
the
nose
is
apathetic
all
things
considering
i
found
the
palate
to
be
a
little
too
harsh
it
is
raw
and
unrefined
yet
scrawny
in
spots
there
is
little
hiding
the
alcohol
while
it
is
not
scalding
hot
it
is
warm
it
is
like
arizona
heat
dry
the
aridness
is
orvallike
to
bad
the
rest
of
the
palate
doesnt
have
the
same
complexities
also
the
noticeable
cleaning
fluid
taste
is
unpleasant
thankfully
it
is
very
slight
there
are
also
some
slight
hints
of
herbs
grass
and
dried
fruit
pears
and
apples
faint
spices
as
well
acidic
and
a
note
of
brett
with
all
that
said
im
not
thrilled
with
the
palate
harsh
on
one
hand
weak
on
the
other
oddly
delicate
when
it
shouldnt
be
this
triple
is
workable
as
a
substitute
for
champagne
medium
in
body
big
lively
carbonation
that
fits
this
beer
ideally
pleasantly
dry
aftertaste
without
much
residual
tang
clean
in
other
words
it
works
well
on
this
beer
i
cant
foresee
another
purchase
of
this
beer
as
there
are
much
better
triples
it
is
not
bad
it
just
doesnt
jive
with
me
purchased
as
part
of
a
samplerpack
in
ames
ia
huge
loose
foamy
white
head
clear
bright
yellow
body
with
abundant
carbonation
wheaty
banana
esters
in
the
nose
plus
some
mild
muskiness
dominant
flavor
characteristic
is
a
moderate
tartness
medium
sweetness
and
lightly
bitter
fizzy
palate
typical
of
this
brewery
this
is
a
fair
beer
but
not
in
league
with
the
elite
belgian
ales
a
better
showing
than
brouwerij
van
steenberges
double
of
the
same
name
an
extremely
heady
pour
requires
a
chalice
with
a
capacity
of
at
least
double
the
33ml
bottle
a
hazy
orangered
pour
smell
is
simple
and
fruity
a
very
sweet
smooth
beer
aftertaste
of
citrus
and
hops
one
of
the
better
beers
from
this
brewery
pours
out
light
with
a
big
white
head
tastes
big
and
fruity
and
full
of
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
where
this
brews
craft
is
showed
off
very
subtile
balancing
act
i
wasnt
sold
on
the
carbination
levels
though
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
worth
trying
or
buying
if
spotted
at
a
store
near
you
the
beer
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
refreshing
pale
malt
scent
with
a
dry
yet
fruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
light
but
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
fruity
it
has
a
spicey
bite
to
it
but
it
is
pretty
smooth
considering
the
elevated
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
brew
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
tripel
it
has
a
light
feel
but
a
malty
flavor
this
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
yellow
gold
color
lots
of
little
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
monsterous
creamy
white
head
leaves
a
trail
of
lace
down
the
sides
the
scent
is
lemony
this
is
a
very
crisp
drink
the
warming
alcohol
well
hidden
but
does
provide
some
spice
slight
hop
presence
some
yeasty
flavors
fruits
overall
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
brew
ever
drinkability
notes
a
modest
brew
still
a
flavourful
brew
just
not
a
brew
that
will
knock
your
socks
off
worth
a
try
though
and
it
should
certainly
be
treated
like
a
dry
champagne
pours
a
fluffy
thick
white
threefingered
head
fades
very
slowly
should
be
poured
slowly
and
leaves
gobs
of

a

3
60
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
tulleys
beer
wine
wells
me
i
like
the
simple
label
with
a
medieval
look
it
pours
in
a
chouffe
flass
rather
clear
for
a
tripel
only
a
hint
of
haze
with
a
generous
white
head
poorly
laced
particularly
big
bubbles
aroma
defines
the
style
good
yeast
character
with
hay
and
grainy
bread
reminiscent
of
leaven
in
mouth
the
balance
is
certainly
not
expressive
where
overwhelming
alcohol
spoils
the
finish
texture
is
mediumthin
with
a
bit
above
average
carbonation
not
complex
there
are
plenty
of
better
interpretations
i
fear
not
really
a
session
beer
the
brew
looked
like
apple
juice
in
my
glass
had
a
fruity
malt
aroma
typical
of
this
style
on
the
tongue
it
had
a
fruit
sweetness
but
thinner
then
i
expected
lacked
the
complexity
that
most
other
triples
have
a
little
tartness
became
evident
in
the
middle
came
in
for
a
somewhat
dry
finish
unless
its
on
sale
ill
probaly
wont
buy
it
again
too
strongly
flavored
and
alcohol
tasting
for
me
better
than
a
macro
but
not
one
id
hunt
down
my
wife
liked
the
label
notes
average
tripel
overly
light
flavour
and
lacking
in
complexity
not
bad
but
definantly
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
was
much
better
two
months
later
on
its
own
would
rate
it
much
higher
lesson
learned
not
a
session
beer
this
one
poured
a
hazy
pale
golden
while
the
head
stole
the
show
with
its
stiff
peaks
of
egg
white
like
head
delicate
maltynutty
and
tart
fruit
elements
form
the
aromatic
structure
here
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
tangy
fruit
attack
start
things
off
and
as
the
tingle
of
the
cleansing
carbonation
subsides
bright
citrus
flavors
come
to
the
surface
enrobed
in
bready
malt
flavors
this
brew
has
a
nice
acid
backbone
that
say
to
me
give
me
some
food
dammityoure
cheatin
me
out
of
my
just
acolades
i
can
see
this
working
nicely
with
a
piece
of
white
fish
a
side
of
potatos
cooked
in
white
wine
and
butter
and
a
crisp
green
salad
plenty
of
yeastylemony
goodness
on
the
tail
end
and
a
good
and
long
malty
finish
im
going
to
use
this
more
often
with
a
meal
and
report
back

2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
light
orangeyellow
color
with
a
heaping
5
finger
duvelstyle
head
i
swear
the
foam
went
a
good
inch
over
the
top
rim
of
the
glass
and
didnt
spill
over
thats
how
thick
it
is
there
is
lots
and
lots
of
lacing
left
here
the
smell
is
fairly
sweet
with
pineapple
orange
and
sugary
malt
the
taste
has
a
mild
tartness
at
the
beginning
it
has
a
lot
of
that
citrus
on
the
tongue
as
well
and
a
slight
bit
of
alcohol
and
sourness
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
and
strong
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
brew
with
this
much
alcohol
a
nice
tripel
flavor
is
intially
largely
malty
with
a
crisp
continential
grain
bite
and
and
a
large
carbonation
bite
with
a
hop
finish
to
the
fore
palate
coconut
becomes
apparent
in
the
finish
before
being
swamped
by
a
large
chard
of
cinnamon
like
spiciness
cloudy
pale
gold
under
a
voluminous
and
wellcontoured
white
head
that
lingers
long
but
leaves
only
spotty
lace
the
nose
is
pleasant
full
of
sugar
and
spice
and
everything
nice
the
mouth
is
quite
prickly
and
somewhat
heavy
with
candy
the
taste
is
nice
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
starts
sweet
with
fruits
and
spices
followed
by
some
malt
the
alcohol
and
hops
emerge
in
the
finish
leaving
a
warm
feeling
in
the
belly
and
a
bite
at
the
back
of
the
throat
the
sweet
and
spice
resume
control
of
the
aftertaste
but
the
hops
linger
somewhere
in
the
background
not
bad
at
all
really
75
cl
bottle
particulate
pale
golden
color
im
enjoying
this
one
myself
and
i
expect
the
second
goblet
to
be
a
whole
lot
hazier
thin
white
head
is
left
shortly
after
pour
vinous
winy
sweet
aromas
melded
with
musty
hops
and
a
healthy
dose
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
lime
citrousy
bite
initially
leading
to
softer
more
sweet
tones
perfect
interlaced
with
musty
hops
nicely
balanced
this
beer
and
maybe
kasteel
tripel
would
be
perfect
substitutes
for
a
dish
that
calls
for
a
chardonnay
or
similar
white
wine
to
complement
it
kind
of
funny
how
ive
had
countless
bottles
of
this
beer
and
finally
got
around
to
giving
it
props
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
nice
amount
of
head
that
coats
the
top
of
the
beer
the
whole
way
down
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
very
much
like
champagne
in
their
carbonation
and
citrus
flavor
a
very
good
beer
only
my
second
triple
if
that
makes
sense
but
i
do
like
the
style
i
like
the
strength
too
hazy
and
slightly
greenish
pineapple
appearance
head
is
bright
white
laces
more
minimally
than
others
in
slipping
rings
bright
smell
cut
with
a
white
winelike
aroma
flavor
is
more
muted
than
i
expected
and
combines
with
lesser
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
yeasty
and
vinous
late
and
on
further
sips
more
consistant
front
to
back
aftertaste
has
grape
like
juiciness
and
settles
in
the
stomach
like
chardonney
including
more
alcohol
power
tripels
this
winelike
are
just
not
my
style
some
similarities
to
piraat
on
this
one
i
was
not
overly
impressed
highly
carbonated
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
yellow
and
slightly
cloudy
very
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
nice
abv
a
bit
thin
but
well
balanced
starting
sweet
with
a
very
crisp
bitterness
to
finish
slight
apple
aftertaste
a
good
beer
not
much
of
a
triple
overall
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
quite
drinkable
actually
the
only
problem
i
have
is
that
as
far
as
tripels
go
its
not
nearly
the
best
example
out
there
pours
to
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
medicinal
and
herbal
the
flavor
is
clean
and
herbal
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
in
the
middle
and
a
yeasty
taste
throughout
it
is
light
in
body
and
easy
drinking
not
what
i
really
expected
with
a
triple
i
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
character
with
this
one
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
it
poured
a
hazy
yellowish
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
the
head
lasted
through
the
drink
and
some
lacing
formed
on
the
glass
it
had
an
extremely
yeasty
aroma
with
nothing
else
noticeable
the
flavor
was
weak
on
the
maltiness
for
a
tripel
and
the
yeast
was
slighly
overpowering
average
bitterness
decent
carbonation
and
alcohol
was
only
slightly
evident
comments

this
tasted
more
like
a
bspa
and
there
was
absolutely
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
this
9
0
abv
bottle
i
was
overwhelmed
by
this
underappreciated
ale
this
one
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
dies
off
into
a
spotty
moundy
texture
with
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
fruity
with
some
breadywheaty
notes
the
flavor
is
spicy
and
the
alcohol
is
evident
the
fruits
are
apparent
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
hops
it
finishes
dry
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
dayton
oh
alefesta
small
sized
ivory
head
that
consisted
of
fine
sized
bubbles
that
was
mostly
lasting
the
body
was
clear
and
carbonated
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
yellow
and
the
nose
was
malty
hoppy
and
also
of
alcohol
it
had
a
lingering
bitter
flavor
and
it
was
also
acidic
this
beer
had
a
burning
sensation
as
i
was
drinking
it
there
was
virtually
no
lacing
with
this
beer
too
much
lemon
and
wheat
for
me
a
bit
onedimensional
and
average
for
the
style
but
still
a
tasty
and
powerful
tripel
medium
gold
color
medium
head
matly
with
a
definite
banana
and
clove
flavor
this
is
a
heavier
bigbodied
triple
ale
complex
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
somewhat
spicy
finish
is
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
spicy
high
alcohol
bite
9
is
not
that
evident
nicely
balanced
carefully
poured
the
body
is
a
clear
yellow
gold
thats
capped
by
an
inch
or
more
of
creamy
brightwhite
foam
fairly
large
bubbles
stream
quickly
towards
the
surface
helping
to
support
the
head
it
displays
excellent
retention
and
leaves
some
very
nice
sheets
of
lace
although
they
tend
not
to
stick
but
rather
rise
up
just
above
the
head
and
drop
along
with
the
level
of
the
beer
probably
due
to
the
high
level
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
light
fruits
pear
and
green
apple
is
it
from
acetaldehyde
or
yeast
and
a
mild
solventlike
character
dominate
some
spicy
alcohol
is
also
present
but
it
doesnt
detract
the
effervescent
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
before
warming
to
become
creamy
which
gives
its
light
body
a
fuller
feel
the
flavor
displays
a
mildly
candyish
and
lightly
fruity
malt
that
harkens
back
to
the
aroma
with
its
notes
of
green
apple
and
pear
but
its
only
lightly
sweet
as
its
backed
by
a
firm
drying
bitterness
a
wash
of
drying
alcohol
and
some
soft
clovelike
spiciness
it
finishes
dry
with
some
fruitiness
that
quickly
fades
to
reveal
a
clear
note
of
peppery
warming
alcohol
which
lays
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
in
the
throat
overall
its
a
pretty
good
tripel
at
a
nice
price
but
it
is
a
little
hot
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
available
good
abbey
tripel
nice
golden
color
hides
well
the
high
level
alcohol
sweeter
then
your
standard
tripel
and
not
a
full
body
that
a
would
have
expected
leave
a
small
head
when
pourred
into
glass
that
disapear
a
tad
too
quickly
for
my
liking
would
drink
this
again
notes
perhaps
a
tad
subpar
for
the
style
but
still
a
tastly
little
brew
surprisingly
drinkable
for
its
9
abv
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
exceptional
it
is
a
very
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
voluminous
ivory
head
that
wont
quit
superior
lacing
qualities
throughout
the
glass
decent
nose
that
shows
real
complexity
and
character
mixing
fruit
and
spicy
aromas
with
its
malt
and
hop
base
very
good
taste
that
is
also
quite
complex
and
given
to
a
varied
palate
as
the
brew
moves
through
the
mouth
and
down
the
throat
the
taste
is
matched
to
its
feel
and
drinkability
very
very
nice
beer
slightly
hazy
light
golden
color
with
an
immense
fluffy
white
head
that
left
a
decent
amount
of
lace
the
aroma
was
superb
with
complex
blend
of
esters
of
clove
coriander
light
fruit
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
smooth
and
wonderfully
rich
with
flavors
of
fruit
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
initially
obvious
the
beer
became
more
complex
in
the
middle
as
subtle
spices
came
through
and
the
malt
varieties
defined
themselves
the
finish
was
sweet
and
slightly
tart
and
very
smooth
a
worldclass
tripel
in
my
opinion
pale
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
lasting
head
aroma
kinda
reminds
me
of
duvel
lightly
flowery
with
some
subtle
yeast
mouthfeel
is
quite
soft
and
a
bit
rounder
and
fuller
than
the
their
dubbel
a
bit
fizzy
and
perhaps
a
little
thin
and
uncomplex
but
its
quite
drinkable
tripels
are
growing
on
me
this
one
is
quite
refreshing
it
is
one
of
the
better
tripel
offerings
poured
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
huge
head
i
had
to
wait
til
it
calmed
down
to
drink
smelled
a
lot
of
candyfruit
to
this
almost
overbearing
but
not
too
far
felt
like
a
thick
champagne
with
a
lot
of
fruit
and
a
little
warmth
on
the
end
being
the
alchohol
this
could
be
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
it
numbs
the
face
and
becomes
gradually
addictive
aroma
was
pretty
simple
made
up
mostly
of
clovespice
quality
big
foamy
white
head
foams
over
the
top
of
the
glass
without
running
over
gold
and
mildly
cloudy
alcohol
actually
is
dominant
including
warmth
from
it
other
flavors
include
malt
and
the
cloves
and
spices
mildy
smooth
but
high
alcohol
crates
a
bit
of
a
bite
thats
not
that
pleasant
carbonation
gives
a
filling
feeling
lacks
fruitiness
or
complexity
and
alcohol
taste
is
too
intense
actually
a
bit
dissappointing
the
literature
stated
that
this
beer
had
fruity
aroma
and
a
soft
sweet
spicyness
lively
mouth
feel
with
a
finish
reminiscent
of
brut
champagne
well
i
did
see
a
golden
yellow
in
color
with
loads
of
thight
white
foam
and
retention
from
start
to
finish
but
the
first
time
i
tasted
this
triple
i
rated
it
2
5
this
time
i
have
given
it
an
average
of
4
what
a
change
from
the
first
time
i
tasted
this
ale
the
taste
of
sweet
spicies
and
herbs
with
just
a
hint
of
a
sour
nature
to
balance
out
this
triple
ale
was
pleasant
pale
golden
color
and
a
majestic
lacey
white
head
aroma
is
typical
for
a
tripel
but
nothing
extraodinary
citrusy
sugary
spicy
but
still
fresh
nice
textures
a
touch
rough
at
first
very
full
occupance
on
the
tongue
but
it
pleasantly
mellows
out
flavors
a
touch
dry
body
is
light
everythings
in
order
but
i
find
this
beer
quite
a
bit
boring
lacks
in
the
taste
department
and
contains
almost
none
of
the
delightful
spark
i
love
in
a
tripel
very
simple
and
unimpressive
pours
with
a
very
white
head
over
a
very
hazy
golden
liquid
with
yeast
in
suspension
clean
maltiness
with
a
strong
fruity
and
alcoholic
nose
taste
is
really
fruity
tropical
and
tasty
with
a
nice
showing
from
the
hops
then
a
wash
of
warming
alcohol
burn
is
felt
as
you
swallow
finishes
up
hoppy
and
fruity
a
super
tripel
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
carbonation
is
high
overall
a
nice
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
ill
buy
this
one
again
the
third
in
my
sixpack
sampler
and
a
good
one
poured
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
cloudy
texture
great
head
almost
perfect
and
it
held
too
the
taste
was
right
on
target
crisp
with
a
slight
earthy
taste
very
very
enjoyable
this
will
be
the
one
i
will
be
looking
for
the
22oz
bottle
not
as
complex
as
i
had
hoped
for
but
nonetheless
still
enjoyable
has
some
mild
hints
of
clove
floral
hops
and
fruity
esters
as
for
9
abv
i
cant
really
taste
it
although
a
few
minutes
after
there
is
a
slight
warming
effect
this
is
a
good
brew
but
the
double
is
a
lot
better
in
my
opinion
decants
a
wan
yellow
under
a
sticky
mount
fiji
an
overripe
tropical
fruit
salad
served
in
a
bowl
of
straw
forms
the
aroma
simmering
carbonation
is
tingly
and
dances
across
your
buds
trailing
a
malt
and
hop
flavor
medley
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
linger
stroking
your
throat
with
liquid
mittens
suitable
for
warm
and
cold
weather
quaffing
ever
since
trying
the
bornem
double
i
have
been
really
excited
to
track
down
the
triple
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
deep
yellowish
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
decently
strong
fruit
esters
figs
i
think
at
first
sip
a
very
sweet
sharpness
is
evident
and
the
aftertaste
tickles
the
tongue
with
the
9
alcohol
and
fruit
esters
that
blend
nicely
overall
very
enjoyable
but
with
the
high
alcohol
these
are
intended
to
be
enjoyed
one
at
a
time
a
slow
sipper
brewery
van
steenberge
is
probably
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
one
of
its
excellent
beers
is
this
one
bornem
triple
pours
a
clear
golden
colour
topped
by
a
nice
white
head
that
settles
down
rather
easily
the
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
taste
was
a
bit
sweeter
than
what
i
expected
but
still
this
beer
is
just
fine
from
all
the
points
of
views
the
pour
a
clear
gold
or
straw
color
the
head
is
portly
and
brilliant
white
with
oodles
of
fine
lace
nose
is
crisp
citrus
light
malts
and
a
bit
sweet
front
is
lightly
sweet
the
top
skinny
the
finish
asperous
modestly
hopped
droughty
aftertaste
hazy
golden
hue
covered
by
a
very
thick
slowly
receding
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
sparse
lace
fruity
ripe
pear
like
sweetness
hits
the
nose
at
first
then
is
ensued
by
contrasting
green
apple
tartness
and
dry
spicy
alcohol
and
light
mineral
notes
dryish
bready
malt
is
perceived
at
first
in
flavor
then
yields
to
candied
apple
sweetness
studded
w
mellow
clove
and
mild
yeast
must
characteristic
black
licorice
muted
sweetness
mid
palate
is
partially
offset
by
lightly
cidery
tartness
the
well
attenuated
and
dry
overall
character
masks
malt
sweetness
which
is
low
enough
to
be
balanced
by
the
mild
hop
bitterness
alcohol
flavors
emerge
in
the
dry
peppery
bittersweet
finish
soothing
ethanol
warmth
emerges
after
a
several
second
deliberation
bornem
is
a
uniquely
dry
and
flavorful
tripel
although
perhaps
not
as
complex
overall
as
other
examples
the
drinkability
is
stupendous
due
to
the
mock
lightness
lended
by
its
dry
character
very
enjoyable
a
very
nice
tripel
indeed
refreshing
and
smooth
and
very
complex
i
recommend
serving
at
about
5055
degrees
f
and
drinking
it
slowly
to
observe
the
way
the
character
of
the
beer
transforms
as
it
warms
very
pleasant
both
cold
and
slightly
warmed
but
in
surprisingly
different
ways
bright
golden
brew
with
a
big
white
head
body
is
eversoslightly
hazy
with
a
few
faint
trails
of
co2
excellent
head
retention
with
bits
of
clinging
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
much
grainier
than
im
used
to
in
a
triple
but
its
not
at
all
unpleasant
still
has
the
classic
fruity
aroma
with
hops
and
spices
that
make
my
mouth
water
very
crisp
taste
grassy
flavor
with
light
fruit
esters
taste
finishes
clean
with
a
spicy
peppery
flavor
with
sweet
fruity
undertones
alcohol
and
carbonation
blend
together
to
give
this
brew
a
warm
tingling
feel
on
the
tongue
alcohol
becomes
more
apparent
in
the
flavor
as
the
brew
warms
adding
yet
another
interesting
twist
in
the
complex
finish
of
the
beer
unfortunatelyi
only
have
one
bottle
from
the

otherwise
id
pour
a

bornem
triple
golden
straw
colored
beer
with
a
huge
dense

that
lasted
and
lasted
a
touch
of
weiss
haze
especially
when
i
poured
the
rest
of
the
yeast
in
very
nice
aroma
of
dried
fruits
and
yeast
hint
of
fruit
sweet

nice
finish
very
good
this
ale
has
a
great
head
and
a
beautiful
goldenorange
color
spicy
and
hints
of
fruit
i
really
sense
a
strong
smell
of
what
can
only
be
described
as
prune
the
flavor
is
complex
with
the
fruity
smell
carrying
over
and
combining
with
a
bready
flavor
it
has
a
nice
heavy
feel
but
the

alcohol
doesnt
slap
you
in
the
face
not
a
bad
trple
ale
by
any
means
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
as
i
always
feel
it
never
hurts
to
try
something
new
you
never
know
what
you
may
come
across

following
the

love
troegs
very
good
blend
of
a
tripel
and
a
golden
ae
serving
type
bottle
mouthfeel
is
zesty
and
fizzy
but
it
slides
down
creamy
and
smooth
nice
contradictions
as
it
kept
my
interest
and
trailed
off
slightly
bitter
and
chalky
dry
i
got
this
bottle
at
the
brewery
over
the
summer
of
2014
and
it
seems
to
have
aged
very
well
as
i
t
heed
the
bottles
warning
pour
it
slowly
and
carefully
everything
about
the
beer
is
above
average
but
it
leaves
just
a
hint
of
aftertaste
that
isnt
as
smooth
as
the
rest
of
it
its
a
very
good
beer
from
a
cool
little
brewery
and
id
drink
it
again
o
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
my
favorite
troegs
offering
i
hope
i
can
obtain
this
great
ale
at
one
of
my
distributors
troegs
has
a
winner
w
this
release
bravo
o
this
beer
is
awesome
extremely
drinkable
despite
the
8
abv
i
will
be
picking
this
one
up
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
7
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
and
some
floaties
in
the

smell
is
of
yeast
some
spices
taste
is
spices
fruits
alcohol
is
present
good
but
less
flavorful
then
expected
for
the
style
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
ps
loved
the
small
corked
and
caged
bottles
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
has
a
couple
of
cool
things
going
for
it
one
is
that
its
a
cool
sort
of
hybrid
on
the
yeast
front
with
elements
of
the
classic
belgian
strains
and
all
their
fruity
intensity
and
also
saison
yeast
more
funky
and
spicy
and
super
super
dry
the
other
thing
is
that
seems
to
be
a
rather
authentic
take
on
the
style
blonde
and
bubbly
grain
and
yeast
driven
delicate
for
its
size
all
of
that
but
instead
of
being
candy
sugar
sweet
in
the
finish
its
very
very
dry
the
rapid
fire
carbonation
helps
that
along
too
but
there
isnt
much
sweetness
left
here
in
this
tripel
a
really
nice
feature
its
also
pretty
light
in
body
for
what
it
is
and
at
8
av
instead
of
say
11
abv
i
can
easily
have
a
few
of
them
well
done
by
troegs
here
this
exceeded
expectations
serving
type
bottle
a
gorgeous
triple
ale
that
cloudy
just
like
it
should
be
pours
a
deep
amber
all
cloudy
from
a
12
7
oz
corked
bottle
that
delivers
that
strong
belgium
ale
aroma
at
just
whiff
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
and
i
just
might
this
is
my
first
venture
with
tröegs
and
i
am
delighted
and
impressed

overall
its
been
way
to
long
since
ive
enjoyed
a
good
tripel
where
have
you
been
spot
on
interpretation
and
yeast
character
fruity
with
an
solid
outstanding
flavor
must
try
overall
its
got
all
the
flavors
of
a
trippel
but
on
the
harsh
side
the
alcohol
is
too
present
even
for
the
relatively
low
abv
maybe
you
could
argue
to
cellar
out
the
harshness
i
think
there
are
way
too
many
great
trippels
out
there
for
me
to
give
that
a
try

d
this
was
a
great
tripel
with
delicate
and
delicious
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
just
right
and
the
finish
was
smooth
with
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
although
could
be
sipped
probably
not
for
aging
perfectly
fit
to
drink
fresh
solid
brew
fantastic
tripel
i
loved
it
really
great
representation
of
the
style
yet
still
having
a
unique
taste
to
it
to
set
it
apart
i
hope
this
is
not
a
one
time
brew
because
id
love
to
have
a
four
pack
of
this
in
my
cellar
along
with
other
tripels
i
like
to
have
around
on
a
rotating
basis
unibroue
chimay
weyerbacher
westmalle
gulden
draak
definitely
try
it
if
you
like
belgian
style
tripels
o
a
nice
beer
and
an
accurate
representation
of
the
style
one
of
the
better
troegs
beers
ive
come
across
in
some
time
overall
its
ok
but
also
hardly
reminds
me
of
any
true
belgian
character
the
beer
also
doesnt
seem
to
have
that
classic
large
and
big
character
i
associate
with
this
style
it
comes
off
more
as
a
slightly
fruity
large
blonde
ale
instead
o
with
a
few
tweaks
i
could
see
this
beer
really
improving
mainly
dialing
down
the
banana
and
adding
some
citrus
to
it
i
love
troegs
and
hope
they
keep
putting
out
quality
brews
this
wasnt
my
favorite
of
theirs
or
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
damn
solid
offering
i
could
see
this
pairing
really
well
with
some
cured
meats
and
big
ups
to
them

not

only
this
tripel
tasted
a

more

i
would
rate
it
as
one
of
the
best
american
tripels
around
overall
an
okay
brew
wouldnt
turn
it
down

wouldnt
rush
to
the
store
to
buy
some
either
o
a

on
a
belgian

affordable
here
in

glad
to

tried

very
well

cheers
to
troegs
do
drinkability
is
fair
due

overall
this
is
a

there
are

out

in

within

was

to
see

in

and
then
looked
it
up
to
find
out
it
is
year
round
but
that
is
probably
due
to
the
new
bottling
line
upgrades
at
troegs
it
gives
you
a

what
their

be
like
i
wish
it
had
a
bottled
on

but
it
is

that

on

very
nice
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
o
a
very
good
stab
at
the
style
very
impressive
actually
a
departure
from
the
styles
troegs
normally
tackles
but
they
did
a
very
good
job
with
this
one
a
successful
attempt
at
a
tripel
this
has
a
nice
rounded
flavor
and
dry
finish
with
darker
malts
this
could
easily
rival
some
of
the
best
belgian
strong
darks
out
there
for
what
it
is
here
its
a
very
nice
dry
belgian
style
tripel
i
thought
this
was
a
well
made
tripel
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
from
an
american
brewer
it
is
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
overall
a
good
triple
nothing
outstanding
here
but
par
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
decent
tripel
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
am
a
fan
of
troegs
and
this
beer
turned
out
well
if
troegs
would
make
the
fruit
more
dominant
and
not
leave
such
a
dry
bitterness
at
the
end
this
would
be
better
o
this
is
really
close
to
being
a
spectacular
example
of
the
style
it
just
needs
a
bit
less
in
the
way
of
overbearing
yeast
everything
else
about
this
one
works
damn
well
its
reasonably
complex
not
overly
sweet
nor
does
it
rely
on
overdone
carbonation
to
mask
the
sweetness
and
pleasant
to
sip
on
certainly
its
worth
buying
again
for
yours
truly
prost
overall
an
above
average
triple
with
nice
apple
and
hay
flavorings
tasty
but
i
have
had
better
in
the
style
certainly
worth
a
try
but
i
will
reach
for
other
favorites
o
overall
this
beer
falls
short
of
outstanding
but
not
by
much
i
would
revisit
overall
not
bad
nothing
too
special
nice
esters
phenolic
notes
are
nice
but
then
get
a
little
chemically
unfortuantely
booze
is
about
wher
eit
should
be
carb
is
nice
but
maybe
a
bit
too
much
i
like
the
early
big
grainy
straw
and
raw
barley
flavors
but
also
not
a
big
fan
of
the
spicy
hop
back
end
so
mixed
but
decent
o
a
decent
tripel
probably
not
gonna
displace
any
favorites
but
a
worthwhile
contribution
to
the
genre
o
i
like
it
as
i
usually
do
when
it
comes
to
troegs
i
probably
wont
be
back
but
i
wont
say
never
glad
i
picked
it
up
and
you
will
too
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
usually
american
breweries
fall
short
on
tripels
but
this
is
pretty
good
overall
a
tasty
beer
with
that
belgian
funk
and
some
fruitiness
another
winner
from
troegs
a
very
good
imitation
of
a
legit
belgian
ale
especially
in
the
body
aroma
is
decent
and
flavor
is
very
good
definitely
worth
trying
as
good
as
some
of
the
lesser
belgian
approximations
from
unibroue
and
ommegang
very
carbonated
as
stated
on
the
bottle
initial
sip
was
a
bit
like
a
bitter
pill
with
some
pilsnerlike
qualities
as
the
beer
settled
in
the
glass
and
warmed
it
began
to
open
up
and
reveal
some
of
its
complexity
warmth
thats
more
like
it
a
good
belgian
style
ale
certainly
worth
drinking
but
not
necessarily
worth
seeking
out
with
all
the
other
good
products
from
belgium
that
are
widely
available
such
as
affligem
which
is
more
enjoyable
a
decent
golden
nonetheless
overall
this
is
a
fairly
great
trippel
ale
i
like
the
balanced
hops
to
malts
and
the
easy
going
coriander
spice
worth
picking
up
just
to
try
the
yeast
is
way
too
potent
and
covers
up
what
could
be
a
more
complex
beer
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
has
a
nice
warming
effect
perhaps
some
aging
is
in
order
unappealing
to
me
ad
i
must
try
again
o
great
beer
and
would
love
more
an
above
average
belgian
from
an
american
brewery
a
good
beer
intentionwise
borders
on
strong
pale
ale
territory
overall
a
very
enjoyable
sweeter
triple
style
brew
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
without
being
over
the
top
in
abv
it
starts
with
malty
sweetness
with
some
bread
and
cracker
action
plus
a
smidge
of
honey
fruitiness
kicks
in
with
some
pear
and
green
apple
plus
perhaps
a
hint
of
melon
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
suggestion
of
yeasty
pepper
kicking
in
at
the
end
quite
enjoyable
and
relatively
reasonably
priced
prosit

nice
job
troegs
o

s
interpretation
but
not
as
good
as

european
counterparts
still

on
the
bready

pours
a

mildly

flavor
brings

rarely
seems
to

to
have
the
chance
to
try
this
one

i
can
only
get

taste
starts
sweet
fruitiness
in
the
middle
spicing
and
some
light
hops
bite
on
the
close
touch
of
alcohol
warming
mouthfeel
is
extra
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
kind
of
surprised
by
this
one
really
goes
nicely
o
i
think
this
fits
into
the
belgian
strong
pale
ale
category
more
than
a
tripel
as
the
flavors
a
very
different
im
excited
to
see
what
this
beer
can
do
as
the
base
for
future
splinter
beers
oak
and
wild
yeast
would
do
wonders
for
this
one
but
the
base
beer
is
just
okay
overall
halfway
decent
tripel
assuming
this
is
meant
to
be
a
take
on
the
belgian
tripel
style
this
is
nowhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
la
fin
du
monde
and
is
too
sweet
for
me
however
overall
im
very
fond
of
this
tripel
its
worth
taking
the
time
to
appreciate
at
different
temps
and
it
even
plays
with
mediterranean
small
plate
foods
surprisingly
well
o
very
nice
american
tripel
the
beer
is
clear
and
golden
with
a
small
white
head
you
aroma
brings
alcohol
oranges
spice
coriander
too
sweet
with
prominent
alcohol
woo
ouch
hold
up
ive
the
top
a
bit
much
on
the
booze
too
sweet
and
boozy
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
overall
eh
my
take
away
a
solid
triple
but
i
cant
help
but
wish
it
were
different
having
had
the
splinter
gold
i
dont
know
if
ill
ever
be
able
to
truly
appreciate
this
beer
for
what
it
is
as
i
think
ill
always
wish
it
was
the
splinter
gold
and
not
just
a
triple
d
a
very
nice
tripel
and
wonderful
initial
375ml
crown
and
corked
offering
from
troegs
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
a
very
enjoyable
one
personally
id
like
to
see
the
sweetness
dialed
up
slightly
that
would
go
a
long
way
in
taking
this
brew
to
the
next
level
slightly
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
but
ill
gladly
revisit
recommend
and
support
this
excellent
brew
from
my
local
brewery
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
an
effervescent
amount
of
carbonation
that
seems
so
overdone
that
it
imparts
a
carbonicmineral
feel
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
this
beer
has
some
real
potential
and
depth
of
character
it
is
just
real
rough
around
the
edges
the
alcohol
is
not
hiding
at
all
even
at
lower
than
ideal
serving
temperature
regardless
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
interesting
offering
from
troegs
this
might
be
the
most
exaggerated
example
of
a
beer
that
i
downright
disliked
at
first
and
grew
on
me
to
the
point
where
i
was
ready
to
open
a
second
bottle
you
really
gotta
let
this
one
breath
to
enjoy
it
though
o
a
nice
enough
triple
it
packs
all
of
the
flavors
you
would
expect
and
it
hides
the
8
rather
well
glad
to
see
them
starting
to
make
beers
like
this
year
round
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
one
develops
yet
another
exemplary
belgian
tripel
poured
with
thick
towering
head
into
tulip
aroma
is
honey
vanilla
and
bread
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
velvety
taste
hits
the
mark
perfectly
yummy
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
golden
amber
with
a
half
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
bready
malt
apple
and
pear
juice
cloves
flavor
is
light
stone
fruit
and
pear
semisweet
bready
lightly
caramel
malt
clove
and
coriander
finishes
with
light
spice
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
a
classically
flavored
belgian
tripel
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
out
of
style
nice
fruit
and
spicing
well
done
for
the
semisweet
style
of
tripel
from
the
750
ml
bottle
purchased
at
servall
liquor
in
san
diego
i
was
not
expecting
to
taste
a
somewhat
wierd
malt
flavor
will
not
get
again
oi
am
pretty
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
like
some
other
petrus
offerings
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
in
pretty
much
every
category
i
find
the
cooked
corn
maltiness
to
be
especially
odd
here
and
the
other
flavors
are
strangely
fruity
and
unbalanced
the
assertive
carbonation
also
detracts
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
presentation
packaged
in
an
elevenpointtwo
ounce
eurostyle
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
an
outstanding
belgian
tripel
crisp
clean
easy
to
drink
not
heavy
at
all
everything
feels
in
balance
and
each
part
complements
the
others
nothing
is
out
of
place
drank
this
on
a
cold
winter
night
need
to
revisit
the
review
on
a
humid
80
degree
summer
evening
and
see
how
it
compares
i
suspect
it
will
be
even
better
in
that
environment
overall
quite
quaffable
and
has
substance
leans
to
dry
and
bitter
o
great
warm
weather
beer
that
would
go
well
with
some
sharp
cheddar
gouda
etc
overall
an
interesting
tripel
overall
this
beer
is
fabulous
very
smooth
crisp
flavorful
but
also
delicate
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
in
the
spring
or
summer
pair
this
beer
with
a
good
quality
hamburger
with
white
cheddar
or
some
belgian
style
fries
and
some
aioli
or
spiced
ketchup
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
small
chunks
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
honey
and
spiced
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
honey
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
interesting
spiced
fruit
aroma
and
flavor
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fizzy
then
smooth
and
foamy
no
ethanol
is
detected
on
the
palate
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
really
solid
tripel
maybe
my
favorite
ever
so
easy
to
drink
no
indication
of
its
strength
and
the
flavor
is
so
well
balanced
and
delicious

this

i
would
not
particularly
recommand
this

this
is
a

nice

very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of

notes
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
the
nice
blend
of
subtle
flavors
is
nice
but
it
is
missing
more
of
the
classic
yeasty
flavor
or
malt
or
hops
that
would
make
this
beer
a
bit
more
tasty
ok
i
did
not
plan
to
review
this
rather
odd
petrus
offering
but
the
unusual
reviews
from
others
dragged
me
into
the
discussion
this
is
an
extremely
fine
mediocre
belgian
true
it
is
nothing
special
but
total
wine
offered
a
four
pack
special
and
the
price
justified
giving
gulden
tripel
a
try
it
is
well
worth
the
discounted
price
i
hesitate
to
judge
a
brew
by
the
price
but
i
always
fall
back
on
anchor
steam
or
sierra
nevada
for
precisely
that
reason
fine
beer
and
justified
price
now
as
what
to
expect
nice
clean
taste
and
appearance
decent
head
with
average
carbonation
i
detect
a
touch
of
citrus
closing
out
a
very
acceptable
alcohol
level
no
bitterness
and
about
half
way
through
the
clean
finish
actually
begins
to
please
the
tastebuds
i
will
not
stock
up
cases
for
aging
but
i
will
be
more
than
happy
to
run
out
of
total
wine
with
another
four
pack
1528
all
in
all
a
good
example
for
a
triple
but
it
lacks
in
depth
and
the
drinkability
is
reduced
due
to
the
in
my
opinion
unpleasant
aftertaste
i
love
tripels
and
therefore
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
do
not
find
a
better
one
overall
a
sweet
sugary
tasty
tripel
o
overall
wow
i
just
dont
know
very
different
than
what
i
was
expecting
after
the
pale
aged
ale
from
petrus
i
dont
believe
ill
buy
any
more
of
this
type
again
though
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
huge
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
good
bit
of
biscuit
malt
as
well
as
a
ton
of
floral
and
berrylike
hop
notes
the
flavor
is
very
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
biscuit
and
grain
notes
with
some
floral
notes
there
is
also
a
good
dose
of
grass
from
the
hops
the
beer
is
not
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
isnt
your
typical
tripel
its
a
little
thick
with
sweetness
and
very
flowery
for
a
tripel
there
are
a
lot
of
parallels
between
this
beer
and
a
pils
there
are
some
spices
in
there
but
its
muted
interesting
but
not
the
best
tripel
tasty
blend
of
a
beer
okay
unlike
the
blonde
they
cop
to
bottle
fermentation
here
now
if
it
is
cloudy
i
have
no
one
but
myself
to
blame
in
spite
of
my
gentle
pour
i
still
got
a
finger
of
fizzy
bonewhite
head
with
limited
retention
color
was
a
beautiful
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
both
midas
and
croesus
were
licking
their
lips
while
greg
koch
again
called
me
out
as
a
wussy
just
more
for
me
greg
nose
had
a
duality
of
upfront
malty
sweetness
underlain
by
a
yeasty
mustiness
on
the
back
side
the
two
melded
nicely
to
produce
a
juicyfruitlike
sweetness
with
rich
esters
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
boy
was
this
sucker
dry
man
i
felt
like
i
had
just
sprinkled
alum
on
my
tongue
shazam
three
beers
later
and
i
have
finally
hit
upon
a
winner
warming
i
began
to
get
hints
of
black
pepper
probably
from
the
yeast
the
finish
was
literally
breathtaking
in
its
dryness
much
much
better
than
the
previous
two
clinkers
i
have
a
new
recommendation
for
people
as
a
result
overall
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
i
do
like
the
interesting
yeast
contributions
the
hoppiness
and
the
dry
finish
good
beer
a
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
different
for
sure
lots
and
lots
of
honey
i
love
honey
so
my
score
is
getting
a
bit
of
a
boost
if
not
for
that
i
think
this
tripel
would
be
at
best
average
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
delicious
lots
of
fruits
some
spice
one
of
the
better
smelling
beers
i
have
had
taste
is
good
but
a
little
disappointing
after
the
smell
there
are
fruits
present
some
malts
and
yeast
a
touch
of
alcohol
coming
through
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
and
easy
drinking
beer
overall
kind
of
middle
of
the
road
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
one
is
just
not
really
grabbing
me
at
all
and
has
a
noticeable
fault
looks
also
a
bit
weak
off
the
pour
as
well
certainly
not
a
creamy
head
at
all
i
think
i
will
most
certainly
pass
on
this
again
o
i
dig
it
a
very
easy
drinking
triple
with
a
well
hidden
abv
could
use
a
little
more
when
it
comes
to
taste
otherwise
still
a
great
triple
o
an
awesome
tripel
up
there
with
the
best
a
tripel
that
starts
strong
but
doesnt
quite
maintain
greatness
as
it
warms
worth
a
try
though
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
was
big
white
and
very
fizzy
as
it
settles
it
leave
a
few
bubbles
along
the
glass
and
has
a
pretty
good
retention
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
full
of
grains
wheat
and
some
spice
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
good
up
front
there
is
some
sweet
wheat
flavors
with
a
touch
of
spice
in
there
then
the
aftertaste
gives
off
some
flavors
of
clove
lemon
and
oats
the
mouthfeel
is
a
really
nicely
carbonated
and
even
had
a
light
creamy
texture
to
it
overall
its
a
pretty
impressive
brew
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
cant
help
but
think
of
malt
liquor
while
drinking
this
not
sure
if
i
really
like
this
beer
or
not
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
wellcrafted
tripel
the
aroma
could
use
a
little
work
but
the
look
is
spectacular
and
the
taste
delivers
for
me
it
is
in
other
words
a
good
beer
and
welldeserving
of
the
high
ratings
its
garnered
im
not
sure
that
it
necessarily
brings
anything
new
to
the
table
for
a
tripel
but
it
does
easily
rank
among
the
better
ales
available
in
this
style
overall
light
and
fruity
just
like
some
girls
i
have
dated
this
is
a
very
one
dimensional
triple
easy
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
for
the
7
5
abv
blond
almost
transparent
fort
oxidized
much
like
a
pilsener
no
flavor
in
the
nose
and
still
classic
fruit
flavors
like
banana
tripel
certainly
very
sparkling
mouth
but
has
absolutely
no
taste
just
a
little
spice
but
without
notable
spices
and
aftertaste
card
and
then
thats
all
or
almost
to
my
taste
it
feels
nothing
at
all
for
a
beer
in
this
category
is
on
the
edge
of
outrageous
limit
to
drink
as
a
lager
of
low
but
hey
there
is
still
talk
of
a
style
triple
a
great
tripel
with
really
lovely
flavours
falls
short
of
true
magnificence
but
its
a
very
enjoyable
drop
jd
large
corked
and
caged
bottle
kept
in
the
cellar
for
2
years
poured
with
some
vigor
and
the
taste
was
nicely
mellowed
but
still
with
all
the
fruit
that
you
expect
from
a
tripple
smooth
finish
but
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
in
the
midbody
very
good
example
of
the
style
o
a
very
nice
brew
probably
my
favorite
petrus
brew
so
far
o
overall
not
a
bad
tripel
though
a
bit
plain
i
feel
like
this
might
have
been
a
better
beer
if
it
hadnt
been
so
highly
carbonated
had
this
after
eating
some
spicey
burritos
with
red
sauce
on
them
d
very
drinkable
belgian
to
me
d
not
bad
but
not
the
best
trip
i
have
had
decent
flavor
but
too
much
funk
and
not
enough
candy
flavor
or
dark
fruits
beer
is
thin
and
watery
with
very
little
flavor
a
little
from
the
pilsen
malt
and
the
rest
is
just
the
esters
from
the
yeast
its
drinkable
but
very
unremarkable
overall
a
superior
gourmet
beer
id
definitely
recommend
this
for
things
like
philosophical
discussions
or
poker
games
but
honestly
i
can
recommend
it
for
a
marathon
beer
or
even
as
a
compliment
for
any
kind
of
meals
i
can
think
of
that
said
itd
go
great
with
ice
cream
or
warm
brownies
or
something
like
that
i
dunno
its
just
too
unique
for
a
serious
meal
pairing
d
gouden
tripel
is

very
solid
but
straightforward

notes

with

tinge
fairly
sweet
smelling

mouthfeel
surpisingly
the
taste
doesnt

sweet
almost
chardonnay

flavors
gives
way
to
a

mild

at

pretty
dry
the

is
slightly
noticeable
but
nothing
too
out
of
control
in
the
end
this
is
okay
but
i
wold
have
preffered
it
a
little
more
flavorful
m
d
sweet
and
one
dimensional
could
have
used
more
co2
to
lift
up
the
flat
sweetness
notes
interesting
beer
that
isnt
exactly
like
other
tripels
ive
had
definitely
a
tart
fruitiness
in
this
beer
some
spiciness
comes
out
as
it
warms
to
compliment
the
hop
flavors
it
just
seems
to
be
missing
something
though
im
liking
it
a
bit
better
as
i
drink
it
and
i
get
a
better
understanding
of
it
and
as
it
warms
so
the
score
could
possibly
go
up
a
little
somewhere
in
between
a
bspa
and
a
tripel
is
what
this
seems
to
be
o
prettygood
representation
of
the
style
it
is
one
of
the
top
dogs
in
the
lower
class
tripel
category
its
no
westmalle
urthel
chimay
or
st
b
but
its
pretty
good
simple
tripel
making
a
pleasurable
drink
i
would
drink
it
again
if
there
wasnt
a
better
tripel
around
cork
lets
off
a
huge
pop
pours
a
somewhat
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
smell
is
somewhat
funky
with
a
big
floral
nose
some
lemon
zest
as
well
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
very
florally
with
lots
of
lemon
and
spice
i
remember
having
this
a
while
back
and
it
being
a
little
sour
this
one
is
not
sour
at
all
though
slightly
funky
aftertaste
with
crisp
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
dry
good
for
this
particular
style
drinkability
is
fairly
high
opening
the
bottle
is
like
opening
champagne
it
blows
up
before
you
can
even
set
the
cap
down
smell
is
like
a
sweet
cider
and
cheeses
though
not
as
cheesey
as
the
dubbel
but
it
still
has
hints
of
the
cheese
the
taste
is
like
apple
pie
with
a
mild
cheddar
with
a
malty
bitter
finish
color
is
gold
with
a
thick
foamy
head
its
definitely
an
experience
to
drink
explodes
out
of
bottle
and
is
difficult
to
control
with
the
foam
everywhere
whats
left
is
quite
drinkable
with
a
five
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
hazy
light
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
light
bread
orange
and
hint
of
yeast
nose
flavor
is
caramel

nh
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
well
crafted
refreshing
triple
d
a
little
different
than
most
other
tripels
ive
come
across
but
it
works
quite
well
i
think
i
would
have
this
again
d
the
beer
was
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
any
traces
of
alcohol
were
very
well
hidden
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
im
pretty
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
was
let
down
i
would
much
rather
be
drinking
a
chimay
blue
for
the
same
price
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
rather
enjoyable
just
not
what
i
would
be
looking
for
in
a
tripel
drinkability
a
classic
tripel
with
a
moderate
strength
would
pair
well
with
a
wide
array
of
cuisine
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
triple
its
very
authentic
and
true
to
its
country
but
there
is
alot
of
competition
for
this
style
from
waffle
land
i
would
go
for
many
over
this
one
in
a
heartbeat
very
drinkable
while
being
kinda
forgetable
i
just
wish
i
could
find
some
petrus
products
on
taps
around
town
i
feel
this
could
benefit
from
it

a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
average
clarity
for
an
unfiltered

and
a
lot
of
fizzy
offwhite

up

the
aroma
is
a

the

the
taste
is
full

about
half

kind
of
a

character

it
that
leafy
grainy
kind
of

characteristic
of

no
heavy
alcoholic
taste
and
rather
smooth
leaves
kind
of
a

ill
wont
pick
up
this
beer
again
a
delicious

refreshing

d
fairly

a
good
beer
overall
almost
trappisteesque
if
i
ever
see
another

ill
rereview

i
would
purchase
this
beer
again
however
on
that
note
this
beer
smells
amazing
that
of
sweet
hops
floweral
tones
and
slight
coriander
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
deep
floweral
and
slight
hops
the
malt
within
it
gives
a
bit
of
a
biting
edge
the
aftertaste
on

is
a

a

d
this
is
an
okay

there
are
certainly
better
ones
out
there
though
d
really
not
too
impressed
with
this
petrus
offering
in
the
past
i
have
enjoyed
their
beers
but
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
follow
suit
the
taste
is
somewhat
bland
like
its
not
really
trying
hard
enough
and
as
for
the
bottle
conditioning
lark
i
think
it
was
more
trouble
than
it
was
worth
i
was
quite
pleased
and
surprised
by
this
tripel
its
a
style
i
usually
like
but
for
some
reason
had
passed
this
particular
beer
by
up
to
this
point
that
wont
happen
again
ill
make
this
a
regular
in
my
rotation
unfortunately
the
age
did
show
forth
id
like
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
as
it
has
potential
to
be
solid
although
probably
not
great
drinks
adequately
for
style
this
is
a
tasty
tripel
its
not
the
most
complex
tripel
on
the
shelf
but
its
very
quaffable
a
nice
thirst
quencher
despite
its
7
5
abv
during
the
hotter
months
i
will
definitely
be
going
back
to
this
one

an

a

a
thick

that
condenses
into
a
rocky
landscape
smells
of
apples

tastes
sharp

in
the
aftertaste
nice

a

really
drinkability

its
a
beer
that
doesnt
grab
your
attention
its
the
honda
accord
of
beers
rather
drinkable
very
light
in
flavor
though
it
has
a
bit
of
a
tangy
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
but
for
the
price
and
as
a
tripel
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
this
brew
pours
up
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
nice
bubbly
white
head
the
nose
is
very
graniy
sweet
candy
sugar
faint
fruit
in
the
backdrop
lemons
are
possibly
those
fruits
i
also
get
notes
of
bubblegum
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
tastes
similar
to
delirium
tremens
heavy
carbo
medium
bodied
a
very
filling
beer
indeed
beer
is
thin
with
hints
of
acetone
very
light
bodied
but
easy
drinking
this
makes
the
beer
drinkability
after
getting
past
the
pain
of
trying
to
get
this
damn
thing
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
a
glass
it
was
quite
a
pleasant
brew
however
with
so
many
nice
ones
out
there
not
sure
i
wills
eek
this
one
out
again
md
strangely
despite
the
monstrous
fizzy
explosion
that
ruins
my
drink
and
stains
the
table
the
palate
in
stark
contrast
remains
at
best
calm
and
it
delivers

great
beer
to
have
with
lunch
with
citrusy
hops
undertones
carbonation
gives
a
lively
mouthfeel
to
this
triple
combined
with
the
clean
taste
a
belgian
tripel
with
pumpkin
and
spices
sounds
odd
but
actually
works
well
the
floral
belgian
yeast
compliments
the
pumpkin
and
spice
nicely
clean
undertones
of
the
pumpkin
and

make
it
work

of
being

done

unique

it

decent

warmth

o
the
pumpkin
spiced
triple
is
a
style
that
i
hadnt
seen
before
this
but
i
like
it
the
pumpkin
spices
seem
to
complement
the
base
triple
flavors
aromas
quite
nicely
id
like
to
see
more
of
this
combo
tried
in
the
future
love
this
blend
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
normal
triple
essences
lots
of
spice
in
the
aroma
initial
foamy
head
subsides
rapidly
taste
comes
alive
with
lots
of
butter
coriander
floral
notes
velvety
smooth
nice
spicy
finish
a
great
tripel
with
a
lack
of
pumpkin
taste
that
loses
points
but
still
stays
strong
as
being
to
true
to
its
overall
style
not
a
whole
lot
of
quality
canned
belgian
styles
so
this
is
a
treat
a
hazy
and
heady
bright
blonde
beer
it
definitely
looks
the
part
sweet
candy
sugar
and
wheat
malt
nose
is
really
intensely
belgian
with
pear
and
apple
and
winter
spice
notes
from
the
yeast
big
no
doubt
too
with
a
little
booze
showing
through
floral
at
first
sip
yeast
meets
hops
and
i
immediately
the
hop
dosage
here
more
than
other
examples
of
the
style
and
its
a
success
yeasty
too
heavy
from
it
despite
ample
carbonation
and
more
sweetness
than
i
care
for
usually
but
thats
more
a
commentary
on
the
style
not
necessarily
this
specific
beer
fruity
and
spicy
both
this
yeast
is
gnarly
grainy
texture
is
cool
but
one
is
enough
i
like
what
these

are
doing

to
have
this
as
an
option

with
a
little
funk
smooth
and
different
from
typical
pumpkin
beers
love
it
deep
golden
yellow
color
in
the
body
i
expect
a
bit
of
haze
in
a
tripel
this
one
has
some
herbal
vegetal
pumpkin
earthiness
off
the
bat
fine
creamy
head
with
nice
patterns
of
lace
aroma
has
a
bubblegum
note
with
honey
coated
biscuit
malt
and
spice
with
pumpmkin
flesh
flavor
a
bit
too
sweet
and
cloying
for
me
spices
although
subtle
just
dont
mesh
well
with
this
8
2
abv
belgian
style
tripel
comes
off
cloying
after
the
first
few
sips
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
in
this
one
way
more
well
hidden
booze
notes
in
the
dark
baltic
porter
the
tripel
seems
a
bit
fusel
mouthfeel
doesnt
burn
with
alcohol
but
the
warmth
hits
me
carbonation
is
not
effervescent
enough
spices
linger
and
dont
belong
in
this
style
but
each
sip
stays
on
the
palate
overall
i
want
a
straight
up
tripel
but
pumpkins
and
spice
sell
in
this
season
overall
i
like
the
baltic
porter
better
than
this
one
there
just
isnt
much
in
the
way
of
pumpkin
character
here
and
it
ends
up
being
more
like
a
messy
tripel
still
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
really
to
style
overall
i
say
this
was
pretty
good
as
i
know
i
would
have
it
again
but
pumpkin
well
i
didnt
really
get
it
overall
a
good
twist
on
a
belgian
style
tripel
good
pumpkin
flavor
that
stands
out
but
doesnt
bury
the
belgian
fruit
esters
a
nice
unique
brew
o
while
this
was
a
tough
beer
for
me
to
rate
i
really
like
it
i
am
not
big
into
strong
pumpkin
flavors
but
i
am
very
happy
with
this
beer
and
would
drink
again
overall
not
an
outstanding
tripel
but
a
perfectly
serviceable
one
finally
a
21st
amendment
beer
that
i
like
its
a
pretty
clear
yellow
color
has
a
spicy
smell
and
taste
lots
of
carbonation
pretty
good
spiced
triple
this
poured
a
deep
yellow
with
plenty
of
yeast
floating
in
it
for
haze
fat
head
of
cream
colored
foam
that
fell
slowly
enough
and
left
a
film
on
top
and
a
ring
nose
is
as
brilliant
as
the
shine
form
out
of
the
body
of
the
beer
soft
malt
biscuity
sweet
with
honey
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
the
pumpkin
spice
and
floral
the
drink
is
outstanding
a
nice
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
lightly
meshed
with
a
stone
fruitiness
juicy
sweet
and
has
a
taste
of
honey
the
malt
is
a
treat
and
its
supple
a
good
carbonation
on
a
medium
body
and
this
finishes
dry
and
with
just
a
hint
of
booze
a
wonderful
tripel
from
these
folks
this
is
a
winner
i
expect
to
pick
up
more
4
packs
unless
i
dont
like
the
baltic
porter
like
that
is
going
to
happen
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
sample
the
medium
body
offers
a
nice
creamy
smoothness
off
a
light
crispness
the
overall
effect
is
clean
even
as
it
dries
out
into
the
finish
a
well
done
tripel
with
the
pumpkin
playing
a
light
pleasant
role
overall
i
like
this
one
better
than
the
porter
the
pumpkin
and
spice
seem
to
add
quite
a
bit
more
to
the
beer
and
it
balances
out
nicely
i
never
would
have
thought
to
make
a
pumpkin
tripel
o
overall
this
was
an
interesting
combination
with
there
was
a
bit
more
pumpkin
in
this
one
but
overall
quite
tasty
o
4
25
higher
possibly
o
a
solid
beer
overall
the
mix
of
pumpkin
ale
and
tripel
works
alright
though
i
wish
there
were
a
bit
more
depth
in
the
flavor
and
less
bitterness
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
rather
nice
blend
between
a
tripel
and
a
pumpkin
ale
its
a
nice
treat
for
the
fall
season
if
you
like
pumpkins
but
want
a
beer
thats
a
little
different
compared
to
the
rest
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tulip
goblet
huge
creamy
white
head
longlived
nice
honey
color
clearly
unfilteredtremendous
lacing
very
belgian

smelling
applespears
smelled
tart
a
bit
of
leatherband
aids
as
it
opened
up
tastes
of
honey
and
belgian
yeast
lingering
bitterness
o
the
backside
which
balances
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
nicely
nicely
carbonated
with
a
mediumheavy
body
this
is
an
excellent
beer
would
i
have
it
again
hell
yes
o
theres
something
offputting
about
the
aroma
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
works
well
i
like
it
much
better
than
the
pumpkin
baltic
porter
that
makes
up
the
other
half
of
the
4pack
12
ounce
can
canned
on
090913
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
i
like
the
aroma
the
brew
smells
like
pumpkin
bready
malt
cloves
belgian
yeast
and
some
peppery
spice
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
pumpkin

peppery

candy
sugar
and
some
mint
and
bready

mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
to
me
its
more
of
a
pumpkin
ale
than
a
tripel
but
im
not
complaining
i
liked
this
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
o
well
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
brews
i
have
ever
tried
combined
with
a
great
triple
does
not
get
much
better
than
this
one
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
if
you
are
looking
for
a
traditional
tripel
this
does
not
do
the
trick
not
bad
and
perhaps
a
smidge
better
than
the
baltic
porter
but
lackluster
i
appreciate
the
effort
to
brew
something
different
but
this
just
didnt
quite
deliver
overall
not
bad
pumpkin
and
spices
get
a
little
much
but
still
kept
in
check
spices
eventually
get
overwhelming
but
still
tastes
like
a
beer
so
not
too
bad
nice
malts
and
booze
profile
o
my
neighbor
gave
me
a
4pack
of
this
stuff
as
a
gift
impressive
a
fantastic
brew
12oz

glass
victoria
gastro
pub
columbia
md
overall
im
quite
impressed
i
like
the
boldness
of
it
and
the
brash
slap
of
alcohol
the
spice
is
interesting
and
i
like
the
way
that
its
dotted
with
short
notes
of
sweetness
and
finally
mint
quite
unique
the
crack
and
inverted
glug
went
smoothly
resulting
in
two
dense
rocky
fingers
of
eggshellwhite
head
with
good

and
the
guess
who
were
back
on
a
reunion
tour
yes
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
was
croesus
mammon
and
king
midas
all
fighting
for
a
sip
i
am
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
the
nose
it
has
a
mustiness
from
the
yeast
that
seems
to
be
at
odds
with
the
spices
it
is
kind
of
evocative
of
pumpkin
pie
but
at
the
same
time
it
smells
odd
mouthfeel
is
thick
viscous
and
it
feels
like
a
glob
in
my
mouth
and
on
my
tongue
there
is
also
some
alcohol
heat
going
on
giving
the
spices
a
real
opportunity
to
be
experienced
phew
i
have
yet
to
try
crime
andor
punishment
but
this
may
be
as
spicy
as
i
would
like
finish
was
dry
really
dry
dry
to
the
point
that
i
may
need
my
inhaler
later
phew
this
is
noplayinaround
beer
i
may
finally
be
warming
up
to
these
pumpkin
spice
beers
keep
the
actual
pumpkin
to
a
minimum
and
i
am
generally
happy
this
is
not
a
great
tripel
its
not
a
great
pumpkin
beer
either
but
its
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
at
the
very
least
its
consistently
interesting
and
worth
a
try
mixed
with
the
tripel
he
said
a
far
more
balanced
nose
spices
play
with
pumpkin
to
a
nice
backdrop
of
roast
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
either
alone
and
the
taste
is
again
more
balanced
its
as
though
one
only
tastes
the
best
parts
of
both
brews
the
finish
is
shorter
again
perfectly
balanced
but
at
the
very
end
becomes
almost
too
vegetal
id
rate
the
mix
at
4
85
it
is
so
close
to
the
perfect
pumpkin
beer
love
the
nose
on
this
airy
and
slightly
sugar
toned
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
tone
to
things
flavor
is
smooth
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
consistent
accents
of
pumpkin
very
smooth
feel
as
well
i
can
tell
that
i
like
this
much
more
than
the
baltic
porter
version
very
nice
beer
o
overall
quite
nice
and
i
like
the
fact
its
not
very
pumpkin
forward
does
feel
like
a
spiced
tripel
good
job
overall
this
was
a
rather
enjoyable
drinking
brew
just
enough
pumpkin
pie
to
give
the
flavor
all
while
maintaining
enough
lightness
to
maintaining
a
very
easy
drinking
and
non
offensive
taste
sweeter
fruity
and
lightly
pumpkin
pie
spiced
with
a
very
easy
drinking
and
delicious
taste
overall
an
interesting
concept
beer
but
i
would
rather
the
two
styles
have
been
separated
not
sure
ill
be
revisiting
this
poured
from
a
can
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
bright
hazy
honeygold
coloring
with
only
a
very
thin
sparse
coating
of
white
head
aromas
of
subtle
pumpkin
sweet
coriander
cinnamon
nutmeg
apricot
clove
and
bubblegum
rich
sweet
and
spiced
all
together
in
a
balancing
blend
flavors
are
pumpkin
sweet
and
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spiced
on
the
forward
tongue
with
a
more
heavily
spiced
character
on
the
tail
end
more
typical
of
the
belgian
styles
with
some
fruity
sweet
notes
as
well
coriander
and
clove
join
the
pumpkin
spices
leading
to
a
moderately
spiced
tangy
sweet
aftertaste
midbodied
and
very
crisp
with
a
linger
of
spices
in
the
tangy
sweet
finish
solid
brew
i
used
to
live
in
seattle
and
i
was
an
avid
attendee
of
the
elysian
pumpkinfest
every
year
such
great
beers
not
just
by
elysisan
of
course
but
they
always
had
an
amazing
six
or
eight
different
varieties
of
pumpkin
beers
they
brewed
themselves
and
most
were
very
good
and
they
surely
were
creative
i
was
excited
to
see
that
elysian
was
involved
in
this
this
pumpkin
tripel
is
not
bad
at
all
but
perhaps
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
nicely
spiced
with
fall
spices
and
with
a
touch
of
pumpkin
creaminess
id
like
a
bit
less
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
pumpkin
not
just
the
spices
still
i
enjoyed
it
well
enough
golden
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
and
a
deep
haze
poured
with
a
short
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
spicy
coriander
and
sweet
pumpkin
aromas
with
belgian
yeast
notes
underneath
medium
bodied
with
smooth
viscous
feel
and
tangy
semidry
finish
sweet
pumpkin
flavors
and
spices
throughout
tangy
hop
bite
in
the
middle
leads
to
a
semidry
finish
much
bigger
pumpkin
presence
than
i
had
expected
this
was
excellent
overall
a
nice
tripel
first
the
quiet
spicing
plays
well
with
the
esters
and
phenols
from
the
yeast
a
well
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
to
pair
with
fall
foods
o
overall
a
disappointment
but
not
unpleasant
if
youre
really
looking
for
pumpkin
beers
poured
this
from
the
can
it
has
orange
color
body
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
has
a
light
smell
of
spice
the
taste
has
a
light
spice
to
it
a
little
pumpkin
but
not
much
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
leaves
a
little
bite
and
overall
has
a
good
form
or
the
belgium
tripel
taste
medium
body
very
smooth
stone
fruit
dry
maltiness
stodgy
pumpkin
pie
spice
peppery
alcohol
mild
phenols
leafy
hop
clean
alcoholic
twang
lingering
spicy
finish
lands
dry
o
i
think
it
could
be
better
the
smell
is
great
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
leave
a
little
bit
to
be
desired
overall
i
like
that
its
a
lighter
pumpkin
beer
and
not
spice
dominated
o
a
cool
concept
providing
two
beers
in
a
4
pack
generally
what
i
do
when
i
create
my
own
six
anyways
two
of
each
i
liked
it
a
great
beer
but
not
a
great
pumpkin
ale
for
those
of
you
who
were
looking
for
one
i
an
really
liking
this
beer
especially
considering
im
not
a
fan
of
either
tripel
or
pumpkin
styles
a
pretty
decent
brew
tends
almost
towards
saison
flavors
with
a
nice
balance
of
pumpkin
the
pumpkin
actually
feels
a
little
weird
with
this
style
so
its
good
that
they
kept
it
subtle
this
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
and
i
like
it
but
its
also
strange
enough
that
id
consider
it
kind
of
a
novelty
i
prefer
the
porter
out
of
the
two
of
this
series
but
this
one
at
least
lives
up
to
the
pumpkin
label
more
noticeably
the
body
was
pretty
typical
for
the
style
medium
and
slightly
sticky
on
the
finish
drinkability
was
ok
the
spiciness
accumulated
over
the
length
of
the
glass
and
i
was
a
bit
tired
of
it
by
the
end
overall
one
of
the
better
pbeers
ive
had
i
cant
honestly
recommend
it
but
i
wont
tell
anybody
to
not
try
it
either
if
you
like
tripels
and
you
like
pumpkin
youll
probably
like
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
pumpkin
some
spices
taste
is
fruity
belgian
yeast
up
front
some
pumpkin
and
spices
later
a
bit
unusual
alcohol
is
well
hidden
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
unique
and
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
since
the
pumpkin
doesnt
overwhelm
the
taste
brings
an
odd
herbal
aspect
with
what
i
am
guessing
is
a
tarragon
galangal
but
is
also
sort
of
floral
with
a
gentle
spiciness
which
augments
the
malt
sweetness
in
a
balanced
way
the
taste
has
a
mild
vegetal
fullness
with
some
mild
alcohol
which
accentuates
the
spice
after
the
swallow
as
the
beer
warms
more
spice
which
has
an
earthy
gingerlike
taste
which
borders
on
medicinal
with
the
phenols
of
the
yeast
overall
i
liked
this
but
would
probably
not
get
it
again
based
on
the
spice
being
a
little
forward
for
my
taste
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
light
to
medium
golden
amber
with
a
fine
two
finger
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
dominated
by
pumpkin
clove
and
allspice
a
hint
of
nutmeg
and
belgian
yeast
flavor
is
pumpkin
nearly
pumpkin
pie
filling
in
character
with
belgian
yeast
and
a
combination
of
pie
spicing
clove
cinnamon
light
nutmeg
and
classic
tripel
cardamom
nicely
balanced
medium
bodied
with
light
creaminess
satisfying
a
well
melded
pumpkin
ale
that
retains
tripel
character
while
presenting
the
pumpkin
pie
character
nicely
spicing
is
deftly
handled
i
either
really
love
or
hate
pumpkin
beers
and
it
really
hinges
on
authentic
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
light
but
distinct
use
of
holiday
spicing
this
one
scores
on
both
fronts
a
really
enjoyable
pumpkin
beer
and
an
unusual
style
for
pumpkin
that
i
will
put
into
my
fall
rotation
if
it
is
made
again
ambitious
take
on
the
classic
that
misses
the
mark
one
and
done
here
fo
sho
all
in
all
this
installment
of
the
he
said
duel
is
a
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
triple
i
really
enjoy
the
addition
of
the
pumpkin
beer
flavors
to
the
typical
triple
flavors
im
certainly
getting
this
again
looks
like
a
tripelyellow
gold
with
a
slight
white
head
coating
the
surface
ripe
fruit
apple
banana
pear
citrus
and
spice
besides
typical
clove
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
the
aroma
very
dry
with
some
fruit
flavor
in
the
beginning
then
bitterness
ending
in
alcohol
warmth
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
just
a
whiff
of
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
as
i
exhale
after
a
sip
but
not
sure
that
id
get
that
if
i
wasnt
looking
for
it
not
a
great
example
of
a
tripel
a
beer
whose
kindred
spirit
is
really
good
bran
muffin
or
paper
rose
a
simple
approachable
entity
that
the
majority
of
those
encountering
it
might
not
readily
deem
definitively
stellar
that
said
i
will
eat
superior
bran
muffins
with
some
frequency
and
paper
roses
are
hella
hard
to
make
so
like
mad
props
you
know
interesting
beer
but
not
really
working
for
me
not
bad
i
just
think
it
would
need
some
revision
with
the
spicing
or
malt
selection
to
strike
a
balance
with
the
yeast
that
would
make
it
more
enjoyable
overall
i
appreciate
the
different
take
on
the
style
the
pumpkin
is
more
present
at
the
beginning
and
meshes
well
with
the
tripel
flavors
creative
i
would
get
this
again
interesting
beer
its
basically
your
typical
attempt
at
a
tripel
by
an
american
brewery
the
pumpkin
spices
are
barely
noticeable
in
my
opinion
solid
beer
but
nothing
too
exciting
i
enjoyed
he
said
baltic
porter
way
more
its
not
bad
but
not
good
either
overall
for
250
it
was
pretty
sweet
i
like
smooth
triples
that
hide
the
abv
well
so
its
a
winner
for
me
very
sweet
vegital
taste
as
well
overall
delicious
interesting
beer
both
an
excellent
tripel
and
a
refreshing
departure
from
the
more
common
pumpkin
beer
styles

spice
profile
completely
dominates
this
beer
to
the
point
that
its
distracting
a
lot
of
stuff
going
on
with
a
nice
almost
clean
finish
its
a
good
take
on
the
style
but
leaves
something
to
be
desired
in
the
long
run
odreally
surprised
to
find
that
i
like
the
tripel
he
said
more
than
the
porter
he
said
its
pretty
neat
the
pumpkin
works
surprisingly
well
with
the
tripel
style
d
definitely
much
more
of
a
tripel
than
a
pumpkin
ale
the
pumpkin
notes
are
uber
subtle
if
i
didnt
now
they
were
present
i
would
have
a
hard
time
actually
detecting
them
with
all
that
being
said
its
a
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
not
sure
i
would
rank
this
high
in
terms
of
either
tripels
or
pumpkin
ales
but
for
those
seeking
out
unique
offerings
this
one
may
fit
the
bill
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
you
really
need
to
try
between
the
taste
aroma
and
mouthfeel
its
a
very
unusual
and
yet
pleasing
beer
o
honestly
this
was
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
pumpkin
tripel
and
definitely
something
id
look
to
purchase
again
its
pretty
competitive
with
dogfish
heads
punkin
ale
for
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
though
since
theyre
different
styles
its
difficult
to
compare
anyway
you
should
totally
check
this
beer
out
if
you
get
the
chance
o
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
the
pumpkin
pie
and
belgian
tripel
notes
actually
blend
together
quite
well
and
complement
each
other
lots
of
sweetness
but
it
is
cut
by
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
so
it
is
just
right
classic
tripel
flavors
mixed
with
a
soft
pumpkin
not
so
much
pumpkin
pie
but
more
of
a
pumpkin
shortbread
cookie
the
heavy
pielike
flavors
were
absent
i
feel
the
flavors
balance
nicely
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
also
nothing
to
pass
on
when
at
the
store
with
2
cans
of
this
and
2
of
the
baltic
porter
costing
a
mere
9
bucks
check
it
out
serving
type
drank
from
a
pint
glass
comes
in
a
12
oz
can
o
very
nice
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
great
combo
very
creative
the
pumpkin
flavor
isnt
too
obvious
but
its
there
i
must
say
i
liked
the
porter
better
but
this
is
solid
ps
i
keep
getting
more
and
keep
uprating
it
seems
to
be
a
beer
that
tastes
better
the
more
you
get
used
to
this
mix
of
styles
ov
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
wonderful
aromas
and
a
flavour
that
makes
you
want
more
might
have
been
even
better
had
the
flavours
of
pumpkinspices
and
the
flavours
of
a
tripel
blended
more
instead
of
coming
in
stages
but
this
is
still
a
very
solid
and
tasty
beer
nicely
done
from
21st
amendment
and
elysian
one
of
my
new
winter
favorites
o
a
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
i
love
these
guys
and
will
try
just
about
anything
they
do
especially
their
brews
that
are
more
on
the
wilddifferent
side
to
have
a
four
pack
with
2
each
of
two
separate

of
beers
is
genius
keep
up

can

simply
delicious
ill
admit
ive
passed
this
one
up
more
than
a
few
times
based
solely
on
its
ugly
label
but
i
have
let
my
prejudice
deprive
me
definitely
one
of
the
better
tripels
out
there
very
impressed
by
val
dieu
highly
recommended
for
the
style
o
taste
is
a
definite
5
hindered
by
the
slightly
better
than
average
appearance
and
smell
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
triples
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
appropriate
for
the
style
this
is
a
beer
that
definitely
improves
with
temperature
very
good
tripel
overall
the
sweet
taste
and
smell
combined
and
the
fact
that
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
brew
are
misleading
not
that
this
is
a
bad
thing
but
its
something
most
people
dont
expect
on
a
beer
with
a
this
high
of
an
alcohol
content
but
thats
what
gives
it
such
amazing
character
and
feel
this
is
a
must
try
overall
a
quite
enjoyable
triple
with
sweeter
fruit
flavors
and
just
enough
boozy
spicy
and
bready
flavors
to
balance
out
all
the
fruit
quite
tasty
though
im
growing
weary
of
tripels
after
having
discovered
that
st
bernardus
makes
the
best
one
this
is
truly
interesting
considering
it
has
a
limited
range
remind
me
of
champagne
so
much
that
mgd
should
be
sued
for
their
champagne
of
beers
slogan
overall
a
very
nice
tripel
though
i
would
put
it
a
bit
on
the
simpler
end
of
the
spectrum
i
miss
a
little
of
the
typical
fruitiness
one
might
expect
from
the
style
but
a
very
appealing
yeast
signature
which
makes
it
a
very
solid
beer
with
its
own
personality
with
this
beer
near
the
end
the
head
and
thick
lace
remains
the
gift
pack
valdieu
glass
seemed
small
at
the
time
but
has
served
wonderfully
keeping
the
head
and
keeping
me
aware
when
my
glass
ran
low
because
i
wanted
more
the
final
pour
included
all
the
sediment
and
became
like
a
good
wit
in
color
and
with
no
large
floaty
chunks
the
only
taste
addition
was
of
subtle
yeast
complexity
a
lovely
brew
even
cloudy
from
start
to
finish
ayieee
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
will
be
buying
some
more
the
next
chance
i
get
definitely
going
to
remain
in
the
belgian
tripel
stable
for
me
o
a
great
musty
triple
that
melds
fruit
and
herbs
together
the
mouth
feel
us
amazing
and
the
bouquet
of
flavor
tops
the
chart
flavor
is
dialed
in
and
delicate
this
is
one
that
i
will
have
to
enjoy
again
soon
cheers
overall
pretty
good
tripel
but
not
excellent
i
expected
more
given
the
scores
it
has
received
different
strokes
morning
pretty
solid
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
will
have
to
look
for
more
of
this
in
the
future

to

on
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
ones
in
the
style
i
have
had
man
this
might
just
be
the
best
belgian
triple
that
ive
ever
had
this
was
just
so
delicious
and
smooth
on
the
palate
with
all
of
the
flavors
that
you
could
want
out
of
the
style
im
still
thinking
about
this
beer
o
was
recommended
to
me
by
my
bartender
while
i
was
in
belgium
after
i
mentioned
liking
the
maredsous
triple
it
did
not
disappoint
just
enough
complexity
and
flavor
to
keep
you
satisfied
but
subtle
enough
to
make
it
to
keep
drinking
was
my
favorite
triple
of
the
whole
trip
o
a
wellmade
tripel
i
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend
interestingly
the
nose
is
the
best
part
overall
a
rather
different
tripel
with
a
bit
of
the
hefe
thrown
into
the
mix
but
really
enjoyable
particularly
as
it
doesnt
supercharge
the
sweetness
or
the
fusel
alcohol
flavors
poured
from
a
750cl
bottle
less
head
and
carbonation
than
previous
tastings
of
this
beercork
stamped

the
aroma
is
fruity
and
fairly
complexmaybe
a
blend
of
apple
but
also
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
something
i
didnt
get
on
previous
notes
at
allthe
color
was
a
hazy
straw
color
slightly
less
spice
notes
than
was
expecting
creamy
mouth
feel
would
like
to
say
i
rated
this
a
little
lower
because
of
consistentcy
from
previous
notes
i
would
still
try
this
one
again
o
okay
but
not
more
than
that
o
a
really
nice
triple
that
is
a
little
different
from
others
ive
had
more
light
fruits
and
spicy
esthers
than
i
would
have
expected
and
i
was
really
impressed
o
very
sweetcitrusy
beer
i
would
compare
it
to
de
dolle
brews
like
arabier
but
much
sweeter
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
one
of
the
better
tripels
ive
had
overall
this
really
reminds
me
more
of
a
hefeweizen
its
really
interesting
however
banana
is
not
a
fav
flavor
of
mine
so
i
would
rather
go
for
another
tripel
it
is
a
very
well
put
together
beer
no
question
but
not
for
me
o
this
is
a
unique
triple
i
cant
say
it
defined
the
class
but
within
the
class
it
is
amazing
seek
this
one
out
overall
a
nice
triple
but
not
the
best
try
it
though
as
you
may
love
its
unique
characteristics
o
a
very
good
tripel
overall
taste
is
very

interpretations
out
there
very
fine
beer
o
a
decent
beer
but
a
bit
bland
overall
id
like
more
presence
from
both
the
light
fruit
flavors
as
well
as
the
spicy
yeast
characteristics
and
while
its
not
as
bad
as
many
takes
on
the
style
theres
still
a
bit
of
a
sticky
sweetness
in
there
that
detracts
from
the
flavors

a

d
this
beer
is
simple
and
elegant
with
some
great
yeast
character
and
subtle
depth
and
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
sweetness
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
i
was
able
to
get
this
in
a
gift
pack
along
with
two
other
valdieus
the
only
bomber
or
single
i
have
been
able
to
find
of
valdieu
is
the
grand
cru
which
is
also
one
hell
of
a
beer
just
wish
i
could
find
this
one
as
well
poured
a
cloudy
medium
amber
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
that
was
fully
lasting
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
of
a
doughy
yeast
a
cereal
malt
and
a
light
flowery
hop
with
notes
of
citrus
and
apricot
it
tasted
sweet
and
mildly
bitter
at
first
and
developed
into
a
sweet
smooth
and
creamy
flavor
with
nice
notes
of
fruit
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
quite
creamy
in
texture
with
a
very
soft
carbonation
overall
a
very
tasty
tripel
d
very
drinkable
and
strong
youll
want
more
than
one
just
pace
yourself
d
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
tripel
found
myself
trying
to
slow
down
just
to
enjoy
it
more
very
smooth
and
bright
d
decent
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
d
the
alcohol
isnt
hidden
in
this
beer
on
the
contrary
it
plays
quite
well
to
create
a
balanced
and
complex
drinking
experience
the
notable
presence
of
it
however
makes
this
beer
less
of
a
session
and
more
of
a
oneoffer
jd
a
fruity
and
sweet
vinuous
tripel
with
nice
malt
smoothness
and
decent
dry
finish
interesting
spices
and
yeasts
make
this
one
a
true
belgiun
brew
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
this
is
an
interesting
tripel
its
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
most
ive
had
while
being
less
spicy
and
dry
i
suspect
its
presumed
age
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
so
id
be
very
curious
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
and
see
how
it
differs
d
what
a
damn
fine
tripel
and
recommeded
d
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
pretty
easy
drinking
with
a
good
taste
worth
picking
up
sometime
if
you
see
it
around
prost
cheers
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
and
one
you
should
not
hesitate
to
purchase
makes
for
an
excellent
afternoon
delight
dthis
triple
was
very
refreshing
and
very
well
made
drinkability
i
really
like
this
one
not
the
best
tripel
but
really
solid
the
best
of
the
val
dieus
that
ive
had
flavor
of
citrus
carries
to
the
taste
and
is
accompanied
by
some
summer
fruit
lightly
sweet
pale
malt
body
and
a
light
citric
bitterness
on
the
finish
creamy
carbonation
gives
a
good
feel
to
a
somewhat
flat
flavor
profile
for
a
tripel
drink
is
held
back
a
bit
by
a
lack
of
passion
for
the
brew
even
though
it
does
drink
rather
well
overall
an
enjoyable
though
somewhat
neutral
brew
that
lacks
the
lingering
finish
of
many
belgian
tripels
d
very
smooth
and
wonderfully
complex
nothing
overwhelms
and
all
of
the
characteristics
are
easily
enjoyed
an
excellent
beer
drinkability
smooth
and
creamy
start
to
finish
very
enjoyable
drinkability
well
you
know
me
and
a
good
tripel
i
could
slam
these
all
night
long
if
i
had
to
whats
that
i
have
to
ok
d
nice
tripel
complex
flavorful
yet
balanced
yeast
character
pretty
subdued
making
the
sweet
finish
pleasant
abv
makes
this
one
a
sipper
d
not
a
bad
little
triple
as
most
triples
this
is
not
a
session
beer
sit
back
and
enjoy
take
your
time
and
enjoy
the
ride
d
good
great
summertime
beer
i
dont
have
ac
in
my
house
and
things
are
warming
up
in
denver
this
is
just
the
beer
summary
this
is
a
pretty
good
tripel
but
isnt
the
stereotypical
one
in
my
opinion
the
color
seems
a
little
darker
and
not
as
cloudy
as
other
tripels
that
ive
tried
i
think
the
alcohol
could
be
hidden
a
bit
better
i
know
people
who
swear
by
this
stuff
but
in
my
opinion
westmalle
st
bernardus
and
unibroue
make
much
much
better
tripels
overall

very
nice
and
drinkable
has
all
the
elements
of
a
classic
tripel
but
is
somewhat
restrained
the
yeast
character
is
especially
muted
compared
to
classic
trappist
examples
d
pretty
good
but
it
is
hard
to
prefer
it
over
other
good
belgian
options
d
i
love
a
good
tripel
valdieu
goes
down
easy
and
knocks
you
on
your
butt
if
youre
not
careful
just
like
a
good
tripel
should
an
excellent
pickup
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
more
than
2
fingers
of
white
foam
really
good
retension
due
to
bubbles
of
carbination
providing
constant
support
significant
amount
of
clingy
lace
all
around
the
glass
sweet
aroma
riddled
with
spice
like
clove
and
fruit
similar
to
pears
and
apples
some
alcohol
thrown
into
the
aroma
as
well
to
mix
it
up
taste
is
sweet
upfront
tasting
like
pearapple
and
clove
tiny
bit
of
hop
bitterness
keeping
the
sweetness
in
check
somewhat
dry
finish
that
is
quite
warming
medium
to
light
feel
and
highly
carbed
lingering
taste
of
the
fruity
sweetness
is
left
in
the
mouth
that
is
similar
to
sour
apple
but
without
the
sourness
if
that
makes
any
sense
overall
very
enjoyable
d
good
but
abv
is
not
well
masked
and
carbonation
is
too
high
overall
excellent
triple
very
true
to
the
style
very
tasty
for
sure
though
perhaps
not
as
good
a
triple
as
their
double
is
a
double
one
to
check
out
if
youre
a
triple
fan
recommended
d
good
for
the
style
which
is
not
particularly
drinkable
with
its
traditionally
big
abv
and
tastes
that
being
said
i
found
the
bottom
of
this
great
looking
snifter
within
about
5
minutes

d
cant
put
the
glass
down
even
though
it
is
now
empty
o
i
have
not
had
much
from
valdieu
previously
but
this
brew
impressed
with
with
its
mixture
of
solid
pale
maltiness
light
fruit
tones
and
deft
alcohol
presence
and
herbal
and
light
citrus
hopping
definitely
give
this
one
a
run
medium
body
and
very
tasty
this
poured
a
hazy
light
gold
with
lots
of
white
head
it
smelled
like
faint
lemon
and
earthy
sour
yeast
with
some
banana
and
light
spices
it
tasted
like
lemon
and
sour
but
creamy
yeast
with
some
earthy
spices
and
a
bit
of
candi
sugar
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
had
a
nice
clean
scent
and
taste
with
a
fairly
smooth
body
but
it
wasnt
very
complex
or
bold
or
unique
in
any
way
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
there
wasnt
much
else
to
this
beer
enjoyable
but
forgettable
finish
is
full
in
the
mouth
as
the
carbonation
dies
quickly
has
a
very
distinct
living
beer
taste
that
i
found
in
a
lot
of
similar
belgian
tripels
strong
9abv
well
hidden
by
citrus
malts
and
the
apple
crispness
and
wheat
grains
renders
a
wonderful
round
finish
that
is
uncharacteristic
of
the
style
d
a
very
moddest
tripel
but
not
a
very
complex
palate
as
others
very
drinkable
d
overall
a
pretty
good
tripel
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
nothing
to
pass
up
and
worth
exploring
for
its
slightly
different
citruspineapple
flavor
as
opposed
to
the
bananavanilla
found
alongside
the
typical
applepear
the
finish
gets
a
little
muddled
and
the
phenolic
aspects
arent
integrated
as
well
as
they
could
be
but
this
stuff
is
small
potatoes
worth
checking
out
and
certainly
something
id
revisit
down
the
road
this
is
a
very
drinkable
triple
nicely
balanced
prickly
carbonation
compliments
the
sweetness
the
alcohol
definitely
has
a
warming
presence
but
adds
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
poured
into
a
snifter
for
a
frothy
head
with
see
thru
rubytinted
body
and
left
lace
sheath
down
my
glass

fruity
orangepearyeasty
belgian
smell
along
with
some
citric
notes
and
mild
caramelized

smooth
creamy

to
medium
bodied

with
great
carbonation

are
almost
chewey
with
some
sweet
malts
balanced
with
pear
citric
and
apple
fruit
notes
with
a
crisp
sharp
finish
thanks
to
some
herbal
hop
bitterness
this
tripel
is
both
fruity
and
sweet
and
dry
and
sour
at
the
same
time
they
really
pull
off
a
balancing
act
i
ended
up
killing
my
glass
real
quick
which
isnt
quite
recommended
considering
the
high
and
hidden
abv
not
that
trips
are
my
fave
but
this
is
one
damn
good
belgian
i
could
drink
this
for
a
good
part
of
the
night
in
fact
i
did
very
nice
this
brew
is
a
golden
blond
color
with
some
yeast
in
suspension
its
generous
head
is
soapy
and
very
stable
leaving
lots
of
intricate
lace
the
smell
gives
the
impression
of
a
dry
yeasty
highly
alcoholic
beer
theres
a
little
medicinal
and
phenolic
quality
lots
of
yeast
in
the
aroma
plus
some
alcohol
the
taste
is
semisweet
with
a
belgian
yeast
flavor
and
lots
of
pale
malt
theres
also
a
warming
that
borders
on
hotness
and
isnt
really
well
placed
finishes
a
little
sweeter
than
the
overall
taste
fairly
full
in
body
this
one
is
satisfying
but
not
quite
good
compared
to
similar
classed
belgian
tripels
d

excellent
representation
for
a
triple
has
all
the
sweet
complexities
i
would
expect
without
being
overly
sweet
or
cloying
its
rare
to
find
this
one
in
my
area
and
a
bit
pricey
but
i
would
look
for
it
as
a
triple
if
i
had
the
craving
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
except
that
this
is
smoothercreamier
strong
citrus
flavors
intermingled
with
the
spice
noted
above
thick
body
with
a
relatively
low
level
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
sour
with
a
strong
yeast
bite
medium
bodied
low
carbo
smooth
like
a
babes
ass
keep
this
in
mind
this
berr
has
been
aged
for
over
200
years
minus
199
so
it
is
quite
on
the
smooth
side
and
it
quenches
quite
quickly
and
qualifies
it
for
the
quad
run
drinkability
passable
by
no
means
by
favorite
tripel
i
would
definitely
prefer
a
chimay
over
this
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
faded
to
just
a
small
area
of
tiny
bubbles
resting
on
the
surface
a
little
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
fruity
and
floral
aroma
that
is
very
pleasing
and
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
reminds
me
of
perfume
fruit
flavors
abound
in
this
tripel
apples
pears
and
grape
flavors
are
noted
some
earthiness
is
tasted
as
the
ale
warms
and
opens
up
is
not
overly
sweet
and
finishes
neutral
alcohol
is
very
well
hiddened
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
well
matched
that
lends
a
nice
soft
texture
the
high
abv
means
trouble
for
such
an
easy
drinking
and
delicious
beer
i
would
definately
buy
this
one
again
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
that
settles
into
a
lasting
lacing
aroma
of
light
crisp
fruit
candi
sugar
and
alcohol
medium
bodied
and
very
quaffable
with
a
very
smooth

very
good
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
triple
ale
very
good
but
short
of
great
pours
golden
with
a
pure
white
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
medium
cap
fairly
nice
lacing
not
as
sweet
smelling
as
some
tripels
but
with
the
standars
belgian
yeast
nose
with
cloves
tangy
sweetness
and
dry
spice
fairly
mellow
flavor
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
relatively
dry
for
the
style
with
a
creamy
light
sweetness
and
some
light
pineapple
banana
and
tangerine
flavors
very
smooth
and
even
a
bit
nutty
and
creamy
on
the
finish
not
quite
as
full
flavored
as
some
but
the
restrained
sweetness
and
the
nicely
subtle
flavors
are
very
pleasant
d
notes
taken
from
original
tasting
on
071908
this
was
a
solid
balanced
beer
d
the
abv
was
fairly
well
hidden
providing
a
nice
tangy
fruity
triple
that
was
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
the
drink
is
crisp
and
medium
in
body
with
fine
carbonation
that
works
great
with
valdieus
brew
this
is
an
excellent
and
refreshing
drink
and
there
is
no
indication
of
the
potent
9
abv
i
nominate
this
excellent
triple
to
be
recognized
as
more
of
a
homerun
drinkability
it
is
a
great
beer
that
i
think
could
be
enjoyed
anytime
serving
type
bottle
d
one
of
the
more
balanced
tripels
ive
had
my
female
companion
also
enjoyed
this
brew
two
thumbs
up
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
small
head
and
average
lacing
into
a
valdieu
chalice
nice
aroma
of
sweet
candy
sugar
and
floral
notes
sweet
as
can
be
plenty
of
belgian
candy
sugar
nice
floral
and
candied
fruit
flavors
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
very
silky
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
lots
of
carboantion
at
first
but
goes
away
quickly
alcohol
warming
can
be
felt
but
it
adds
more
complexity
to
the
brew
very
nice
would
like
to
get
some
more
pours
a
nice
a
nice
orangy
gold
tint
with
a
fair
amount
of
haze
head
retention
isnt
great
but
it
had
a
nice
fluffy
head
sweetness
is
present
in
the
aroma
like
smelling
hard
candy
type
of
sweetness
on
the
tongue
followed
by
another
sweetness
closer
to
anise
or
black
licorice
finishing
with
a
dryness
very
nice
i
like
this
triple
its
clear
that
it
has
around
the
average
strength
of
a
triple
at
9
cloudy
bright
yellow
some
banana
and
lemon
what
a
sensational
beer
i
had
this
at
a
tasting
at
my
own
abc
store
in
gainesville
unfortunately
it
was
in
a
tiny
plastic
cup
at
first
but
i
later
snatched
a
wine
glass
to
get
its
full
flavor
and
what
a
flavor
poured
a
peircing
gold
color
with
a
magnificant
head
smell
was
of
raisins
and
some
dried
fruits
taste
was
wonderfully
balanced
nice
and
chilled
on
the
tongue
masking
the
alcohol
warmth
honey
laced
green
apples
came
to
mind
along
with
suculent
green
grapes
bubbly
on
the
finish
almost
like
a
fine
champagne
what
a
great
triple
fairly
weak
within
the
style
triples
are
great
and
there
are
too
many
good
ones
to
have
a
mediocre
example
below
average
for
the
style
and
very
unimpressive
d
while
this
isnt
exactly
my
favorite
tripel
it
is
certainly
drinkable
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
complex
enough
to
hold
your
attention
bottle
poured
a
dirty
orangey
color
ale
with
a
nice
big
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
nice
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
ester
with
a
lightly
spicy
touch
is
very
interesting
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
between
some
sweet
malt
with
some
notes
of
fruity
ester
and
some
lightly
spicy
notes
form
the
yeast
great
carbonation
with
a
full
body
and
no
alcohol
was
apparent
very
well
done
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
regular
access
to
i
actually
wouldnt
want
more
than
this
11
2
ounce
bottle
it
is
way
too
unbalanced
acidic
and
a
sweet
tart
overload
the
lack
of
complexity
also
keeps
it
from
being
anything
special
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
virtually
no
head
smell
is
kind
of
weak
but
hints
at
biscuit
malt
and
spice
tastes
malty
with
biscuit
malt
having
a
firm
presence
with
some
faint
toffee
and
notes
toward
the
finish
tastes
somewhat
fruity
also
but
more
of
an
apple
than
a
citrusy
like
im
used
to
from
the
style
mediumbodied
with
moderate
to
low
carbonation
tasty
and
pleasant
but
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
the
alcohol
is
not
even
noticeable
complex
and
unique
worth
a
shot
im
a
tripel
guy
and
i
love
a
good
trappist
ale
it
was
suggested
to
me
that
i
try
this
brew
with
an
open
mind
to
see
what
i
thought
overall
awesome
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
an
abbey
tripel
i
loved
it
if
you
are
into
abbey
trips
you
have
to
try
this
one
i
had
a
bottle
at
the
room
in
miami
beach
fl
poured
from
bottle
in
tasting
glass
the
appearance
is
very
nice
it
is
what
one
would
expect
from
a
quality
triple
thick
brillantly
white
head
that
dissapates
after
about
5
minutes
the
nose
is
overripe
pears
caramel
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
nice
well
balanced
too
well
balanced
intially
the
sort
of
triple
malty
sweetness
you
would
expect
followed
by
an
initially
oily
than
creamy
finish
i
gave
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
a
5
because
of
the
9
0
wtf
this
beer
has
managed
to
hide
the
alcohol
somewhere
i
cant
really
find
it
on
the
nose
taste
or
finish
bravo
i
would
love
to
drink
many
this
a
gorgeous
example
of
a
tripel
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
slightly
orange
cloudiness
to
it
theres
a
great
deal
of
sediment
in
the
glass
which
i
swirled
around
before
drinking
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
apples
honey
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
pepper
despite
the
carbonation
theres
a
creamy
almost
buttery
feel
to
it
however
theres
enough
of
a
spicy
alcohol
kick
to
perfectly
balance
the
flavor
i
drank
one
glass
without
realizing
it
has
9
abv
i
was
really
surprised
because
this
beer
is
so
deliciously
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
damn
drinkable
at
9abv
dangerously
so
very
complex
and
highly
enjoyable
even
if
you
dont
like
this
style
or
even
belgians
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
delicious
beer
that
if
not
for
the
9
abv
i
could
have
several
this
one
ranks
up
among
the
better
tripels
hard
to
beat
my
only
complaint
is
the
cork
is
a
bit
too
shallow
and
potentially
dangerous
when
opening
i
like
this
tripel
a
lot
but
not
at
the
expense
of
blindness
by
cork
overall
a
very
drinkable
wonderful
tripel
far
better
than
two
brothers
version
but
not
quite
as
good
as
a
chimay
worth
a
try
for
sure
overall
tripels
are
amongst
my
favorite
beer
styles
and
this
is
now
amongst
my
favorite
tripels
good
stuff
i
am
more
of
a
fan
of
dubbels
than
tripels
but
this
is
much
better
imo
than
val
dieu
brune
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
sediment
in
the
glass
smells
of
esthery
fruits
maybe
pears
and
corriander
belgian
candied
sugar
is
evident
too
very
smooth
not
much
aftertaste
except
for
the
fruit
no
sourness
no
bitterness
great
lacing
very
strong
and
deceptively
so
a
true
keeper
and
an
outstanding
beer
palate
is
soft
with
malty
sweetness
more
fruit
some
banana
especially
and
finishes
with
light
dessert
spices
hazy
yellow
with
a
touch
of
orange
hue
mild
bigbubbled
carbonation
sticky
and
still
decent
malt
backbone
to
it
with
the
sweet
at
the
end
and
the
citrus
at
the
start
well
hidden
alcohol
warming
but
smooth
as
butter
overall
a
decent
tripel
excellent
drinkability
tripels
are
slowly
becoming
my
favorite
style
this
isnt
exceptional
but
it
is
extemely
drinkabke
and
very
flavorful
overall
it
may
be
great
for
some
but
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
i
can
tell
it
is
very
well
made
it
is
probably
great
for
those
for
whom
it
matches
just
not
me
finally
the
finish
was
long
and
warming
with
just
a
hint
of
bitter
though
not
meant
as
such
this
would
make
a
good
winter
warmer
i
think
this
beer
is
a
nice
refresher
beer
but
not
the
first
triple
id
reach
for
really
not
my
favorite
style
of
belgian
but
still
a
good
brew
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
summer
day
in
florida
or
anywhere
else
i
highly
recommend
this
tripel
be
careful
though
as
it
can
put
you
down
quickly
with
its
deceptive
strength
very
drinkable
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
just
drinkable
enough
to
be
dangerous
very
good
easy
drinker
very
flavorful
easy
to
convince
others
of
its
qualifications
solid
tripel
served
with
a
great
head
that
was
slow
to
diminish
but
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
great
spice
and
floral
hops
the
taste
was
of
sharp
crisp
citrus
and
spice
the
beer
was
very
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
this
is
one
to
be
careful
with
overall
i
must
say
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
very
drinkable
but
not
too
many
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
to
its
mellow
flavor
state
pours
very
clear
and
light
gold
with
a
just
slightly
offwhite
head
that
lacks
volume
but
coats
the
side
of
the
glass
in
brussels
lace
fairly
slight
aroma
of
white
candi
sugar
and
a
vague
rough
aroma
like
finegrained
sandpaper
but
the
beige
uncolorful
kind
what
im
saying
is
that
the
aroma
is
not
too
compelling
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
that
doesnt
do
enough
to
balance
things
out
theres
a
creaminess
to
the
mouthfeel
that
combines
with
the
sweetness
of
the
palate
to
make
things
unpleasantly
sweet
overall
this
is
an
ok
tripel
but
not
something
that
displays
the
balance
and
depth
of
aromaflavor
that
the
better
example
of
the
style
do
nice
to
try
but
not
worth
buying
a
second
time
for
me
ill
stick
with
the
valdieu
blond
and
brown
theyre
better
d
a
higher
abv
without
a
strong
alcohol
taste
makes
me
think
of
a
warm
summer
meadow
this
beers
overall
qualities
are
why
i
love
triples
so
much
all
in
all
a
recommended
tripel
nicely
balanced
tasty
and
all
around
enjoyable
not
something
i
would
go
looking
for
i
wish
i
had
a
large
bottle
as
smaller
bottle
tend
to
deliver
as
well
in
my
experience
d
very
tasty
goes
extremely
easily
not
filling
at
all
quite
poundable
but
the
abv
will
catch
up
to
you
quickly
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
served
in
my
valdieu
chalice
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldorange
color
with
about
an
inch
or
so
frothy
head
the
aroma
isnt
strong
at
all
but
it
does
smell
spicy
and
yeasty
luckily
the
taste
is
much
stronger
than
the
aroma
is
it
tastes
like
pears
lemon
yeast
grapefruit
bananas
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
decent
sipping
beer
as
you
can
tell
this
beer
has
a
higher
abv
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
great
id
still
try
it
again
sometime
from
a
750
ml
caged
corked
bottle
poured
a
hazy
hazy
golden
color
with
hints
of
orange
very
nice
lacing
sweet
sugary
belgian
yeast
smell
juicy
touch
of
malt
taste
of
light
banana
spicy
alcohol
nice
body
creamy
smooth
very
drinkable
but
beware
of
the
abv
very
nice
again
very
drinkable
in
a
sneaky
way
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
filling
body
and
pleasing
aftertaste
drinkability
is
sort
of
an
issue
because
of
the
high
abv
and
residual
sugar
still
pretty
nice
for
an
afternoon
sipping
beverage
this
was
not
the
beer
i
expected
this
is
an
imminently
enjoyable
tripel
and
i
highly
recommend
it
good
body
despite
the
head
carbonation
is
not
overwhelming
drinkable
to
an
extent
9
abv
limits
the
session
factor
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
d
surprisingly
light
for
the
volume
of
flavour
and
much
more
mellow
than
initially
indicated
by
the
nose
very
drinkable
beer
but
remember
to
pace
yourself
drinkablity
quickly
making
its
way
up
my
top
styles
triples
are
a
flavorful
yet
light
way
to
enjoy
belgians
and
this
is
no
exception
great
drinkability
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
this
val
dieu
triple
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
brown
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
mild
but
fruity
taste
is
a
bit
fruity
pear
particularly
stands
out
not
as
fruity
as
i
might
have
liked
very
well
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
had
this
on
a
beautiful
august
day
at
ebenezers
pub
in
lovell
me
served
in
a
chalice
it
was
a
beautiful
yelloworange
with
a
thick
sticky
head
stuck
my
nose
in
and
inhaled
a
great
mix
of
yeast
and
fruit
mostly
banana
a
spicyfruity
taste
very
pleasant
with
a
nice
tartness
at
the
finish
nicely
carbonated
very
smooth
could
easily
have
more
than
one
very
tasty
and
complex
qualities
make
drinkability
high
the
moderate
abv
should
be
noted
but
i
would
certainly
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
somewhat
dry
with
a
definite
pepper
quality
that
tantalizes
the
tongue
and
dances
across
the
mouth
sweetens
by
midsip
though
the
spicyness
still
dominates
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
though
there
is
a
sensation
reminiscent
of
doing
a
vodka
shot
that
sneaks
into
the
corners
of
the
mouth
towards
end
sip
nicely
crafted
and
definitely
worth
checking
out
i
think
this
beer
could
be
really
great
if
the
alcohol
wasnt
such
a
huge
player
in
the
flavor
there
isnt
must
to
say
about
this
beer
its
not
great
but
its
not
bad
essentially
its
not
worth
getting
unless
youre
a
frat
boy
who
wants
to
get
plastered
without
venturing
too
far
from
your
demesne
of
cheap
swill
md
creamy
texture
and
rather
lightbodied
for
a
9
0abv
the
alc
strength
hides
very
well
like
other
mellow
yet
robust
tripels
showing
good
signs
that
this
is
a
really
mature
product
with
a
good
depth
not
terribly
complex
but
very
enjoyable
all
the
same
i
will
buy
this
the
next
time
im
in
a
liquor
store
the
beer
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
its
light
and
fruity
with
loads
of
yeast
esters
and
pale
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
warm
with
some
residual
sweetness
the
taste
is
well
balanced
and
quite
fruity
with
a
nice
yeasty
element
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tastey
brew
with
high
drinkability
its
not
my
favorite
triple
but
it
works
for
me
guess
ill
be
on
the
bottom
of
reviewers
just
found
this
boring
and
tedious
i
should
give
it
another
chance
but
doubt
if
i
get
around
to
it
disappointed
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
a
large
pillowy
head
a
layer
of
nice
lacing
sticks
to
the
side
of
my
duvel
glass
aroma
is
sweet
spicy
and
malty
taste
is
typical
for
a
tripel
spicy
fruity
peppery
and
yeasty
with
that
trademark
sweetness
that
belgian
candi
sugar
lends
to
this
type
of
brew
this
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
very
easy
drinking
for
its
strength
not
one
of
the
better
tripels
out
there
but
still
plenty
good
syrupy
slick
mouthfeel
very
carbonated

overall
a
good
beer
body
is

softly
carbonated

texture
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
strong
ale

an
excellent
tripel
val
dieu
hasnt
let
me
down
and
the
three
brews
ive
had
have
all
been
pretty
fantastic
if
you
can
find
the
gift
pack
and
youre
a
belgian
fan
dont
hesitate
to
pick
any
of
the
styles
up
the
tripel
being
one
of
the
best
appearance
was
orange
in
color
and
a
creamy
head
looked
promising
but
fell
apart
and
left
spotty
lacing
the
smell
was
very
interesting
involving
various
fruits
in
which
apricot
apple
and
pear
were
included
the
taste
was
much
of
the
same
but
i
also
found
some
spices
including
vanilla
and
nutmeg
body
was
medium
to
full
nice
and
creamy
going
down
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
down
and
will
probably
be
picking
up
another
bottle
in
the
future
this
beer
poured
clear
and
golden
with
a
white
head
it
had
a
sweet
and
flowery
aroma
it
tasted
sewwt
flowery
had
no
pronounced
bitterness
it
was
light
and
very
nicely
carbonated
i
thaught
that
it
was
very
well
ballanced
and
generaly
great
tasting
33cl
bottle
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orangeyellow
and
makes
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
into
a
halo
never
ending
bubbles
rise
from
the
sides
of
my
glass
maintaining
the
subtle
head
making
it
long
lasting
yeasty
bready
aroma
with
hints
of
banana
and
clove
lots
of
banana
and
clove
flavor
crisp
peppery
spicyness
quite
good
one
of
the
best
tripels
that
i
have
ever
tried
creamy
smooth
medium
bodied
palate
with
bubbly
carbonation
finishes
incredibly
dry
this
is
great
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
a
nice
tripel
different
in
its
spiciness
very
fitting
for
warming
up
on
a
snowy
day
spent
sledding
with
my
sons
ultimately
this
ale
proved
refreshing
in
the
same
manner
as
a
good
saison
but
a
little
bland
with
the
wealth
of
tripels
that
exist
in
the
modern
american
beer
market
i
doubt
i
would
purchase
this
again
but
i
encourage
all
to
try
and
make
up
their
own
minds
pours
a
cloudy
yellowgold
color
with
offwhite
head
that
is
just
incredible
in
terms
of
its
thickness
and
retention
great
rings
of
lace
are
left
behind
in
my
goblet
the
aromas
i
detect
are
mostly
of
dried
fruits
alcohol
and
yeast
the
taste
is
typical
for
this
style
with
some
small
deviations
this
beer
has
greater
lingering
candylike
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
greater
presence
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
an
interesting
triple
but
not
my
favorite
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
unusual
in
my
opinion
for
this
style
i
didnt
enjoy
the
aftertaste
nor
did
i
like
the
alcohol
taste
upfront
with
minimal
masking
and
so
i
would
not
want
to
have
more
of
these
in
one
sitting
drinkability
other
than
scaring
me
a
good
solid
drinkable
belgian
tripel
ill
probably
pick
it
up
again
sometime
valdieu
valley
of
god
triple
is
somewhat
unheralded
but
it
still
manages
to
holds
its
own
with
some
of
the
better
known
tripels
from
the
land
of
all
good
tripels
belgium
although
it
doesnt
supplant
my
favorites
its
clearly
a
wellcrafted
beer
that
should
be
a
source
of
pride
to
the
brothers
of
abbaye
valdieu
its
strength
and
quality
has
led
to
my
serenity
i
like
this
one
poured
a
deep
slightly
hazy
golden
with
some
noticable
deep
orange
huethe
aroma
definently
had
a
little
funkiness
to
it
like
wet
grain
and
sour
apple
with
that
belgian
yeastiness
some
clove
and
smoke
big
phenolic
flavors
quite
spicey
with
an
underlying
powdered
suger
note
there
is
a
decent
fruity
apricotlike
flavor
in
the
finish
that
lingers
nicely
a
solid
triple
i
have
had
better
but
this
is
not
shabby
by
any
means
at
all
opinion
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
it
is
a
bit
on
the
clean
side
for
a
tripel
and
is
probably
the
clearest
example
that
i
have
had
that
is
truly
from
belgium
i
cant
knock
it
for
being
clean
but
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
this
beer
reading
the
bjcp
guidelines
for
this
style
it
calls
for
predominant
citrus
and
that
the
malt
should
support
in
this
case
the
malt
is
a
key
player
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
but
something
to
note
i
really
like
this
beer
but
its
not
big
on
the
mouthpuckering
effect
that
drives
many
of
us
to
seek
out
tripels
i
thought
this
was
a
very
drinkable
triple
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
this
one
had
a
1206
on
the
cork
which
i
am
forced
to
assume
must
mean
best
if
consumed
by

it

a
beautiful
a

impression
is
left
moderately
bodied
o
a
different
take
on
a
tripel
its
got
the
classic
triple
flavors
but
enhanced
by
oak
and
los
of
fruity
notes
o
a
fantastic
beer
that
ive
been
sitting
on
for
far
too
long
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
just
a
hint
of
a
warming
sensation
had
a
bottle
at
toronado
san
diego
not
cheap
every
year
russian
river
does
damnation
aged
and
i
figured
i
would
try
it
out
the
bottle
says
aged
with
oak
chips
definitely
note
of
something
a
bit
woody
with
a
stronger
mouthfeel
than
regular
damnation
goes
down
smooth
with
a
bite
at
the
beginning
taste
is
similar
to
damnation
with
a
distinct
twist
the
appearance
is
a
perfect
amber
color
with
a
little
lace
around
the
glass
it
smells
a
good
bit
like
hay
while
i
would
prefer
almost
all
of
russian
rivers
beers
over
damnation
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
was
it
worth
the
20
dollars
i
spent
on
the
bottle
hell
no
the
idea
of
drinking
a
limited
beer
is
nice
but
i
would
take
most
of
their
other
brews
over
this
one
still
very
good
as
are
all
of
their
brews
this
weekend
i
take
on
pliny
the
younger
overall
an
odd
beer
a
smell
i
cant
quite
place
the
flavor
is
complex
but
not
really
a
tripel
points
for
being
interesting
overall
this
session
was
amazing
ill
admit
i
was
a
little
concerned
with
the
amount
of
time
this
sat
in
the
cellar
and
how
it
would
age
those
concerns
were
unnecessary
this
is
an
amazing
brew
and
vinnie
knows
exactly
what
he
iswas
doing
the
oak
chips
brought
out
something
special
in
this
beer
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
damnation
and
it
is
not
to
be
missed
pricey
maybe
worth
it
absolutely
o
interesting
tripel
very
unusual
not
much
oakiness
to
this
one
its
quite
sweet
and
has
an
odd
funkiness
to
it
that
i
dont
usually
get
lots
of
sweetbread
and
yeast
at
least
didnt
quite
hit
me
right
but
its
not
horrible
just
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
not
a
big
fan
and
tripels
are
usually
my
favorite
belgians
overall
didnt
really
pick
up
on
the
oak
as
much
as
i
would
have
expected
but
a
fantastic
beer
a
really
great
drink
to
sip
on
during
the
colder
weather
i
liked
this
one
much
better
than
the
regular
damnation
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
just
a
layer
of
off
white
head
im
getting
lots
of
belgian
yeast
spice
in
the
nose
along
with
a
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
interesting
im
still
getting
the
belgian
spice
along
with
a
malt
sweetness
but
there
is
also
an
oaky
note
and
a
fruity
note
i
would
say
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
the
head
sticks
around
all
the
way
through
the
pour
o
this
is
like
a
slightly
stronger
slightly
drier
and
more
tart
variation
on
regular
damnation
pretty
good
taste
is
outstanding
full
bodied
as
the
aroma
with
all
of
those
elements
zesty
but
slightly
oily
lightly
spicy
faintly
sweet
tingly
and
engaging
o
overall
i
thought
the
beer
looked
and
smelled
really
good
but
it
was
not
quite
as
dry
as
i
enjoy
tripels
the
spicing
seemed
to
be
done
very
nicely
but
i
dont
know
how
much
oak
aging
this
beer
has
actually
made
an
influence
on
it
i
could
not
know
this
it
could
have
a
profound
impact
but
there
really
isnt
much
oak
to
it
i
didnt
get
any
alcohol
burn
although
the
flavors
did
come
through
a
bit
most
likely
the
aging
has
taken
care
of
it
its
a
good
tripel
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
to
get
it
again
d
this
is
a
good
take
on
the
regular
version
i
didnt
realize
this
was
a
triple
and
not
a
blonde
ale
but
given
the
change
up
in
styles
i
still
really
enjoyed
this
one
another
winner
from
rr
aged
my
other
bottle
15
months
not
much
has
changed
still
strongly
carbonated
the
major
difference
is
the
alcohol
burn
has
mellowed
significantly
odd
bubblegumbanana
note
still
there
and
i
like
it
bump
it
up
another
tenth
of
a
point
or
so
its
just
great
i
cant
pick
up
on
much
taste
the
alcohol
just
destroyed
me
really
a
burn
in
the
throat
as
i
drink
it
the
oak
is
bright
enough
to
make
me
wonder
if
it
is
a
virgin
barrel
i
just
cant
endorse
this
one
its
primary
and
final
impression
it
left
on
me
was
damn
that
tastes
like
im
drinking
ginvodka
o
overall
the
oak
is
an
improvement
on
an
already
great
beer
very
happy
with
batch
23
love
me
a
good
tripel
and
this
is
a
great
take
on
the
style
bottle
poured
a
hazy
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
super
huge
foamy
had
with
excellent
retention
and
some
very
good
lacing
aroma
which
consists
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
are
well
balanced
against
the
sweet
notes
of
the
malt
bill
taste
is
a
great
mix
between
some
citrus
and
floral
hoppy
notes
and
some
semisweet
malt
notes
oak
is
very
subtle
but
seems
to
bring
a
rounder
taste
at
the
end
yeast
strain
a
somewhat
fruity
and
can
be
detected
body
is
full
with
great
conditioning
and
some
excellent
carbonation
with
no
apparent
alcohol
this
is
a
great
improvement
imo
over
the
regular
version
which
is
just
too
fruity
m
medium
this
brew
blends
the
components
well
and
is
one
of
the
more
complex
triples
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
enjoy
this
is
an
excellent
tripel
though
this
particular
batch
is
really
striking
me
as
a
bit
too
hot
maybe
it
needs
some
time
to
mellow
out
that
issue
aside
this
is
still
pretty
good
through
the
burn
i
am
getting
nice
character
and
a
good
profile
even
though
this
might
need
to
mellow
a
bit
its
still
nice
375ml
bottle
of
batch
69
that
i
shared
with
a
friend
golden
yellow
color
decent
head
smells
estery
and
a
whole
lot
like
damnation
to
me
the
flavor
was
a
bit
of
pear
belgian
yeast
maybe
i
havent
had
damnation
in
a
while
but
this
tastes
a
whole
lot
like
what
i
remember
i
did
not
taste
any
oak
whatsoever
i
will
say
that
the
alcohol
was
imperceptible
which
is
pretty
amazing
given
it
was
listed
at
like
10
8
or
something
nice
beer
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
for
o
very
tasty
and
eerily
drinkable
for
the
style
and
alcohol
content
the
quality
is
tip
notch
highly
recommended
d
very
drinkable
excellent
tripel
with
great
balance
the
oak
is
a
really
nice
touch
that
adds
some
great
complexity
as
well
o
regular
damnation
is
quite
possibly
my
wifes
favorite
beer
and
is
quite
delicious
in
my
book
too
so
an
oakagedstronger
version
of
it
hell
yes
this
did
not
disappoint
at
all
so
flavorful
and
mellow
with
barrelaging
complementing
wonderfully
at
12
7
oz
split
two
ways
it
disappeared
far
too
quickly
would
love
to
have
this
again
it
was
a
great
night
cap
to
an
excellent
birthday
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
nose
is
an
incredible
orange
rind
bittersweetness
with
pungent
alcohol
the
taste
is
light
and
sweet
with
a
subtle
touch
of
oak
the
aftertaste
is
a
honey
sweetness
followed
by
some
wood
but
its
hard
to
recognize
the
aftertaste
is
just
as
light
and
refreshing
honestly
this
beer
was
way
better
than
expected
with
big
citrus
notes
from
the
tripel
followed
by
an
interesting
wood
infusion
very
drinkable
beer
possibly
the
best
ba
tripel
ive
had
although
i
still
have
my
bottle
of
allagash
to
try
next
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
i
am
not
much
of
a
funk
fan
but
this
is
done
very
well
i
marked
the
taste
and
overall
score
down
as
the
coriander
and
lemon
zest
is
a
bit
too
dominating
in
the
finish
taste
wise
though
is
where
this
beer
starts
to
excel
it
asserts
itself
on
the
pallet
nicely
very
fruity
apply
tart
like
notes
4
5
d
definitely
a
solid
tripel
not
the
most
complex
but
great
flavors
that
come
together
well
overall
very
different
if
you
like
this
type
of
different
youll
enjoy
it
o
good
beer
has
a
sharp
flavor
with
some
added
oak
accents
that
bump
it
up
well
done
and
refreshing
for
a
slightly
warm
night
will
be
interested
to
see
how
this
ages
thanks
for
the
extra
bottle
kurtis
complex
and
flavorful
tripel
brings
a
ton
of
different
angles
the
only
thing
i
dont
really
notice
is
the
oak
but
the
beer
itself
seems
better
than
the
damnation
i
had
somehow
pretty
awesome
a
whole
different
beast
from
the
regular
damnation
a
delightful
beer
with
lots
of
flavour
a
nice
rounded
body
and
lots
of
citrus
the
oak
seems
to
be
missing
but
i
still
like
it
bartender
poured
into
this
into
a
tall
tulip
glass
revealing
a
slightly
hazy
golden
hue
a
fingerwidths
worth
of
creamy
foam
capped
it
off
the
nose
is
sharp
with
belgian
yeast
lemon
zest
faint
tangerine
the
mouthfeel
was
much
smoother
than
anticipated
aided
by
the
oak
chips
no
doubt
light
bubbly
finish
light
hoppy
flavors
meld
well
with
the
yeast
character
and
then
finishes
with
a
mildlytart
citrus
snap
spicy
lemons
come
to
mind
with
this
beer
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
rr
has
made
another
standout
brew
here
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
o
good
beer
oak
is
right
on
target
finish
is
smooth
it
is
overcarbonated
as
hell
but
the
flavor
is
just
great
without
a
massive
head
the
beer
looks
great
great
overall
and
i
would
happily
drink
this
again
overall
loved
it
the
complexity
and
balanced
between
belgium
yeast
hops
tartness
and
richness
was
splendid
overall
i
thought
this
was
exactly
how
i
anticipated
a
russian
river
tripel
to
taste
like
very
nice
and
complex
i
highly
recommend
overall
i
loved
this
one
gonna
grab
a
few
more
bottles
too
see
how
it
holds
up
with
a
little
age
this
to
me
is
the
ideal
tripel
doa
o
a
pretty
good
tripel
lots
of
complex
flavors
drinkability
is
very
high
im
actually
surprised
at
the
alcohol
content
russian
river
never
disappoints
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
considering
the
abv
if
youve
tried
the
regular
damnation
or
youre
looking
for
a
good
americanmade
tripel
this
is
a
good
option
o
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
ever
had
although
it
could
use
more
funk
if
you
like
this
one
seek
out
a
similar
one
by
a
la
fut
out
of
quebec
called
tripe
à
3
brett
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
very
carbonated
it
has
a
solid
warming
factor
about
it
and
a
nice
arrangement
of
flavor
initially
that
sort
of
falls
apart
as
it
warms
up
and
more
sips
are
taken
i
think
the
oak
and
hoppy
bitterness
clashes
with
the
yeasty
spices
and
it
overall
distracts
from
the
experience
instead
of
complimenting
it
it
lingers
inside
the
mouth
with
almost
an
oily
feel
that
mixes
with
a
bit
of
astringency
it
isnt
a
horrible
brew
by
any
stretch
it
just
isnt
quite
for
me
and
what
i
expect
from
a
tripel
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
shared
the
bottle
with
my
family
and
we
enjoyed
it
for
an
11
offering
this
one
hides
its
boozy
side
very
very
well
otherwise
a
very
solid
tripel
though
the
barrelaging
barely
shows
up
in
the
flavor
profile
my
bottle
at
stone
brewing
bistro
and
gardens
yeasty
aroma
mostly
starts
sweet
and
then
finishes
bitter
funkier
as
it
warms
hits
the
style
and
also
funkier
than
the
style
would
be
much
better
with
food
375
ml
is
sufficient
without
it
enormous
head
o
i
like
this
beer
this
beer
a
lot
i
want
to
age
a
few
bottles
but
they
dont
last
long
in
my
cellar
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
3
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
dots
and
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
belgian
yeast
spices
grain
and
some
light
fruity
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
exactly
the
same
with
a
slight
woody
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
astringent
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
in
the
back
of
the
throat
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
and
another
great
beer
from
russian
river
i
am
very
happy
i
was
able
to
find
one
of
these
o
this
was
really
a
great
beer
definitely
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
have
enjoyed
to
date
it
hides
the
high
alcohol
dangerously
well
it
has
a
great
complex
taste
and
is
well
put
together
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
of
the
style
the
oak
seemed
a
little
more
subtle
but
did
provide
a
little
more
depth
to
it
it
had
a
nice
range
of
flavors
to
it
and
was
a
very
good
tasting
beer
overall
another
damn
fine
beer
from
rr
what
else
needs
to
be
said
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
star
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
its
like
there
is
a
cloud
on
top
of
my
beer
the
smell
is
lightly
spicey
with
hints
of
bready
malts
i
also
get
hints
of
the
oak
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
and
fairly
dry
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
another
winner
from
rr
the
nose
was
a
little
subdued
for
me
but
that
is
my
only
substantial
critique
delicious
rrs
mastery
of
both
american
and
belgian
styles
of
beer
is
truly
amazing
the
addition
of
oak
added
a
subtle
yet
significant
layer
of
complexity
to
this
brew
that
elevated
it
to
the
next
level
for
me
and
to
boot
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
11
russian
river
is
my
favorite
brewery
so
i
had
to
have
this
i
will
say
its
not
something
i
need
to
seek
out
again
but
im
super
happy
to
have
tried
it
its
certainly
not
bad
by
any
means
just
not
smoething
i
need
more
of
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
was
an
improvement
on
the
base
beer
its
very
similar
and
there
is
not
much
oak
at
all
i
think
the
normal
damnation
looks
a
little
better
so
this
rated
slightly
below
it
4
vs
4
03
but
both
are
good
beers
interested
to
see
what
happens
to
it
with
some
time
on
it
as
the
alcohol
was
there
in
the
taste
this
is
an
ok
beer
at
best
and
to
be
honest
at
the
price
russian
river
asks
for
it
damnation
23
is
flatout
unacceptable
i
really
have
to
wonder
what
the
grades
would
be
for
this
beer
if
it
didnt
say
russian
river
on
the
label
overall
pretty
nice
light
and
refreshing
not
that
complex
but
drinkable
should
have
compared
this
side
by
side
with
the
regular
damnation
medium
bodied
with
some
soft
carbonation
up
frot
along
with
a
champagne
like
efervesence
that
gives
off
hints
of
bready
yeast
and
light
fruit
esters
lots
of
sweet
apple
and
pear
along
with
slight
booze
and
spice
but
this
is
nicely
mellowed
out
by
the
oak
presence
not
overly
dry
or
toasted
with
hints
of
coconut
and
vanilla
that
nicely
masks
the
high
abv
some
virgin
oak
beers
taste
like
charred
tooth
picks
but
here
it
is
nicely
integrated
into
the
flavor
of
the
base
beer
complex
flavorful
and
dangerously
drinkable
overall
a
tripel
takes
a
lot
of
finesse
and
this
one
has
a
fair
amount
in
the
end
its
just
a
little
too
one
sided
with
all
the
spicy
yeasty
mustiness
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
was
not
expecting
the
fruity
refreshing
light
characteristics
that
came
out
the
abv
is
really
hidden
for
being
11
d
eh
i
hate
to
say
vinnie
makes
a
bad
beer
but
if
he
does
this
is
probably
it
i
wont
pay
12
for
this
again
do
in
general
the
wild
ales
of
russian
river
are
a
glorious
expression
of
imperfection
possibly
some
of
the
most
extreme
challenging
and
coveted
americanbrewed
beers
this
woodaged
batch
of
damnation
is
most
of
those
things
yet
it
is
less
challenging
and
seems
to
be
nearer
to
perfection
appearing
as
much
like
an
imperial
sanctification
as
a
wild
version
of
damnation
it
lacks
the
palatescorching
sourness
which
has
come
to
define
that
other
beer
in
recent
times
it
is
beguiling
and
drinkable
not
suggestive
of
the
high
10
percent
abv
thanks
in
large
part
to
the
rewarding
textures
it
is
imparted
with
damnation
batch
23
69
pours
what
vacillates
between
a
hazy
goldenrod
and
lemon
yellow
depending
on
the
degree
of
backlighting
the
creamy
white
froth
that
forms
at
the
top
of
the
glass
reaches
just
short
of
three
fingers
in
height
head
retention
is
very
good
but
lacing
is
nonexistent
as
surprising
as
it
is
disappointing
the
first
whiff
is
all
juicy
pale
fruits
gobs
of
granny
smith
apples
and
pears
in
time
a
rounded
oaky
aroma
melds
nicely
with
some
light
phenolic
notes
to
play
against
the
fruitiness
it
would
be
nice
if
they
were
a
bit
more
apparent
though
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
one
dimensional
as
while
the
fruits
still
take
center
stage
everything
else
jumps
out
a
bit
more
specifically
theres
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
as
well
as
a
slightly
more
pronounced
clove
and
pepper
yeast
presence
woody
influence
from
the
oak
is
a
bit
more
subdued
here
than
in
the
nose
and
theres
a
light
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
for
some
reason
my
immediate
reaction
on
the
first
sip
was
that
the
beer
is
overcarbonated
but
thats
definitely
not
the
case
what
is
the
case
is
that
the
body
is
absurdly
light
and
dry
for
an
11
beer
the
carbonation
is
creamy
and
lively
just
about
spot
on
batch
23
is
a
bigger
badder
version
of
regular
damnation
a
fantastic
brew
in
its
own
right
and
one
ill
have
to
look
into
getting
some
more
of
another
fantastic
beer
from
russian
river
this
in
my
opinion
is
an
improvement
on
normal
damnation
not
amazing
but
tasty
the
beer
pours
cloudy
gold
with
an
orangy
hue
and
certainly
has
a
persistant
head
of
whipped
white
beyond
that
the
beer
is
overall
much
fresher
and
spicy
perhaps
some
vanilla
this
time
around
and
less
oaky
the
extent
of
the
oak
is
in
the
tannic
aftertaste
which
would
be
easier
noted
if
it
were
not
there
certainly
picking
up
lots
of
apples
and
shades
of
banana
and
booze
spicy
and
dryish
a
bit
bigger
all
around
from
the
previous
batch
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
honey
gold
in
color
with
a
billowing
three
finger
soapy
white
head
it
took
about
five
minutes
for
the
head
to
recede
the
aroma
consists
of
some
spicy
belgian
yeasts
orange
peels
coriander
fruity
esters
and
a
slight
floral
componenet
cant
pinpoint
the
flower
its
nice
and
aromatic
the
flavors
are
smooth
and
yeasty
i
pick
up
plenty
of
fruit
esters
slight
bubblegum
spicy
yeasts
more
yeast
and
slight
banana
there
is
also
some
slight
butter
most
likely
from
the
oak
aging
since
they
dont
say
im
curious
as
to
which
oak
they
used
local
french
etc
regardless
its
solid
it
drinks
very
well
for
being
11
and
the
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
at
all
this
is
a
nice
tripel
and
pretty
drinkable
id
like
to
have
this
again
but
for
me
the
standard
is
still
la
fin
du
monde
pours
darker
than
regular
damnation
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
with
average
retention
and
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
oak
honey
bready
malt
and
fruit
like
mango
melon
and
citrus
much
less
yeast
and
spice
than
regular
damnation
and
much
more
fruit
and
sweetness
slightly
fuller
body
with
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
with
mild
tart
notes
a
little
more
enjoyable
fresh
than
the
bottle
of
batch
46
we
tried
a
few
months
ago
pours
a
beautiful
orange
color
with
a
three
finger
soapy
white
head
good
lacing
and
great
carbonation
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
my
snifter
glass
the
nose
is
a
little
funk
grass
wood
slight
alcohol
and
clove
not
super
balanced
but
i
get
plenty
of
aroma
very
sweet
and
smooth
as
well
ah
interesting
taste
i
get
wood
a
tiny
bit
of
funk
tangerine
grass
and
spices
in
the
background
excellent
taste
the
feel
for
me
is
the
weak
point
in
this
beer
its
medium
bodied
w
good
carbonation
and
a
strong
smooth
malt
backbone
however
theres
a
real
biting
acidity
that
takes
over
and
destroys
everything
else
feelwise
if
it
was
a
little
more
in
balance
it
would
be
a
higher
score
overall
this
is
a
really
outstanding
beer
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
cheers
23
is
better
than
the
usual
damnation
but
not
by
much
i
hardly
get
any
oak
o
nice
balance
abv
is
well
integrated
overall
a
really
solid
beer
very
glad
to
have
this
as
i
missed
batches
23
and
46
golden
full
bodied
aftertaste
that
only
gets
better
the
damnation
batch
23
is
a
tribute
to
the
name
and
embodies
the
perfection
of
russian
river
at
its
best
not
much
more
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
grade
a
and
you
have
to
try
it
if
you
find
this
beer
buy
it
o
a
really
great
beer
although
one
would
probably
be
my
limit
too
bad
it
doesnt
make
it
out
here
o
a
pretty
good
beer
nice
fruit
flavors
and
the
oak
brings
a
nice
component
as
well
not
something
i
would
go
to
all
the
time
but
would
certainly
drink
it
again
d
very
tasty
surprised
i
have
not
had
this
one
before
i
love
this
beer
russian
river
is
special
to
me
having
lived
in
santa
rosa
for
a
few
years
when
it
was
still
under
the
radar
but
this
is
probably
my
emotional
favorite
its
delightfully
balanced
complex
and
oaky
as
all
hell
not
to
mention
a
bit
of
funk
even
with
no
claimed
brett
presence
if
you
ever
see
one
fresh
go
for
it
you
wont
regret
it
damnation
23
is
a
very
good
beer
i
liked
damnation
i
love
damnation
23
i
love
the
bigger
more
intense
flavor
but
i
love
the
balance
that
is
maintained
more
the
oak
aging
does
wonders
for
the
beer
really
adds
depth
the
moves
this
beer
into
a
higher
tier
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
making
for
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
pick
up
a
bottle
if
you
run
into
one
well
worth
your
while
o
good
and
easily
drinkable
though
ive
got
to
admit
this
one
was
quite
a
bit
more
subdued
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
batch
69
i
didnt
even
know
they
aged
any
of
this
on
oak
let
alone
on
regular
intervals
until
tonight
right
on
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
topped
by
plenty
o
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
peel
bleached
wheat
light
soap
light
balsa
and
light
banana
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
light
orange
zest
and
some
light
brettlike
funk
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bit
o
brew
though
i
feel
like
the
oak
was
far
too
subdued
for
everythings
own
good
yeah
i
admit
i
was
looking
for
some
crispy
oak
notes
in
there
good
times
nonetheless
batch
69
pours
a
very
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
that
has
a
slight
orangish
hue
to
it
scent
is
immediately
funky
with
definite
barnyard
aromas
and
some
tangy
tart
fruit
scents
a
bit
of
tangerine
mixed
with
cinnamon
spice
and
belgian
yeast
spicy
and
fruity
with
just
a
bit
of
hoppiness
taste
is
initially
bready
buttery
yeast
flavors
with
citrus
funky
yeast
flavors
with
some
clove
and
orange
flavors
the
oak
comes
through
in
the
flavor
more
than
in
the
aroma
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
pepper
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
full
bodied
drinkability
is
high
especially
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
i
enjoy
this
a
lot
more
than
regular
damnation
yet
another
solid
offering
from
rr
overall
actually
am
enjoying
this
normally
tripels
are
not
my
beer
of
choice
but
this
one
with
the
classic
rr
twist
on
it
is
quite
good
glad
i
have
a
couple
to
cellar
paid
10
99
for
the
bottle
wish
it
wasnt
the
last
one
overall
a
delicious
beer
for
sure
balanced
and
filling
head
tropical
fruit
nose
a
little
bread
some
belgian
notes
flavor
of
roasted
pineapple
and
white
bread
with
a
faint
hop
bitter
that
pairs
with
a
hint
of
oak
tannin
and
vanilla
nice
drinking
a
little
high
on
the
carbonation
really
good
much
more
than
the
regular
damnation
boy
o
boy
onto
something
here
mmm
hm
i
let
this
warm
up
some
out
of
the
fridge
to
about
perfect
temp
poured
with
a
colossal
foamy
frothy
fluffy
sudsy
offwhite
head
that
soon
settles
down
to
some
scud
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
bubble
trails
aroma
is
yeast
hop
malt
oak
caramel
spice
bread
dough
and
makes
me
want
to
quit
screwing
around
and
drink
it
flavor
doesnt
let
me
down
a
bit
very
similar
to
nose
but
all
have
more
impact
vineous
and
flat
out
tasty
very
true
to
style
body
and
carbonation
is
similarly
true
to
style
finish
is
like
flavor
and
trends
more
towards
vineous
and
has
the
slap
happy
boozieness
wot
a
beer
yessir
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
to
style
russian
river
is
a
master
of
hops
and
yeast
but
the
malt
character
of
this
particular
beer
just
wasnt
wowing
me
the
oak
also
brought
very
little
to
the
party
though
i
have
to
say
i
didnt
sense
the
11
abv
in
this
beer
at
all
props
overall
a
solid
oakaged
tripel
yes
thats
what
we
call
it
overall
a
very
good
tripel
this
is
a
better
version
of
the
original
o
i
have
been
trying
to
track
this
one
down
for
quite
a
while
and
luckily
there
is
not
an
ounce
of
disappointment
to
be
found
here
hard
to
remember
em
all
but
this
might
be
my
favorite
tripel
to
date
standard
issue
damnation
is
good
but
this
takes
it
to
another
level
gonna
have
to
seek
out
a
couple
more
of
these
while
they
are
still
relatively
available
truly
enjoyed
this
brew
props
to
vinnie
crew
for
creating
another
great
beer
this
one
pours
a
golden
light
orange
with
a
solid
white
sticky
head
smells
of
lemon
pepper
sweet
fruits
orange
and
banana
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
tartness
of
citrus
tangarine
oak
and
alcohol
its
medium
to
light
bodied
well
carbonated
and
not
much
heat
from
the
amount
of
alcohol
to
be
honest
i
was
i
little
dissapointed
with
this
beer
i
think
i
had
my
hopes
set
a
little
too
high
its
still
a
very
good
beer
o
this
is
great
much
better
than
the
standard
damnation
would
love
to
find
more
of
this
rare
little
gem
one
of
if
not
the
best
triples
i
have
had
and
does
not
drink
like
an
11
beer
o
ive
not
much
experience
with
belgian
style
beers
tripels
but
i
feel
that
this
review
will
stand
an
amazing
beer
hops
are
really
fragrant
but
its
not
a
bitter
beer
hugely
drinkable
for
a
strong
beer
nice
lacing
and
carbonation
as
well
on
tap
at
pizza
port
in
ocean
beach
o
very
enjoyable
worth
the
purchase
and
i
would
probably
get
it
again
for
friend
to
try
overall
a
great
representation
of
the
style
kudos
again
rr
o
verrry
nice
but
how
can
you
go
wrong
with
this
style
from
rr
really
good
maybe
even
great
but
not
mindblowing
dr
very
drinkable
expensive
but
quality
id
have
it
again
it
was
a
real
treat
to
enjoy
it
on
draught
ive
never
had
regular
damnation
but
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
tripel
very
robust
in
flavor
i
rarely
enjoy
beers
above
10
percent
abv
because
i
dont
like
the
boozy
flavor
but
its
not
present
here
the
way
this
beer
hides
its
alcohol
content
is
pretty
insane
i
sense
black
magic
here
from
vinnie
i
always
enjoy
the
every
23rd
batch
of
damnation
certainly
more
than
the
original
damnation
still
russian
river
makes
other
beers
similar
to
this
one
that
i
feel
are
more
focused
in
their
approach
and
are
considerably
better
despite
this
its
still
a
very
good
beer
verdict
this
is
a
really
great
beer
i
like
the
damnation
as
it
is
but
its
not
really
one
to
blow
me
away
this
batch
with
the
oak
flavors
brings
out
some
added
complexity
and
really
takes
this
beer
to
another
level
ive
had
it
now
in
a
bottle
and
on
draft
and
both
are
exemplary
decent
lacks
some
complexity
though
cheers
overall
its
not
that
great
i
liked
damnation
better
and
i
dont
need
to
seek
that
one
out
again
either
how
appropriate
that
damnation
23
is
my
666th
review
overall
a
very
drinkable
transitional
sour
very
complex
flavorsaromas
well
carbonated
im
excited
to
see
how
this
one
ages
very
close
to
if
not
full
bodied
with
a
delicate
level
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
with
all
the
pluses
im
getting
from
it
the
alcohol
is
almost
barely
noticeable
im
digging
batch
23
big
time
o
this
beer
is
really
good
but
i
have
to
admit
i
know
very
little
next
to
nothing
about
tripels
stylistically
the
yeast
wasnt
exactly
estery
but
the
breadiness
of
malt
married
suggestions
of
light
citrus
to
perfection
the
mouth
had
this
spritzy
effervescence
that
makes
me
think
this
is
something
to
consume
fresh
theres
a
great
deal
to
appreciate
in
this
beer
and
i
can
see
a
lot
of
nonbeer
drinkers
picking
this
out
as
a
favorite
in
a
tasting
definitely
give
batch
23
a
swirl
sometime
i
think
its
russian
river
doing
what
they
do
best
scary
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
id
be
interested
to
see
how
this
develops
with
age
cheers
this
is
a
great
beer
and
it
hides
the
11
abv
amazingly
poured
from
bottle
into
duvel
tulip
easy
pour
yielded
a
sizable
head
about
2
5
fingers
thick
not
very
stable
it
settled
quickly
soft
white
with
residual
bubbles
nose
is
complex
yeasty
esters
take
front
white
pepper
sesame
evergreen
trees
and
wood
taste
is
noticeably
deviant
pretty
dry
yeasty
a
lot
more
wood
as
it
warms
its
even
a
very
very
small
bit
tart
in
the
back
not
my
particular
style
preferred
but
it
is
strangely
alluring
i
enjoyed
it
much
lots
of
carbonation
on
this
one
early
on
but
mellows
out
nicely
no
lacing
to
be
found
nice
treat
glad
i
came
across
it
without
having
to
go
to
the
brewery
at
that
o
great
great
beer
on
par
with
bruery
premiere
for
me
o
very
well
excited
beer
very
true
to
the
style
nice
treat
from
rr
didnt
really
get
too
much
oak
but
lots
of
spice
and
a
great
yeast
presence
o
nice
and
funky
but
light
and
refreshing
o
this
beer
has
pretty
much
blown
me
away
a
fantastic
beer
which
has
great
age
potential
im
thinking
36
years
wonderfully
smooth
with
any
rough
edges
sanded
down
and
given
a
light
polish
bright
and
lively
with
sharp
carbonation
and
a
moderately
fruity
character
that
avoids
straying
into
an
excessively
yeasty
realm
etoh
is
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
lending
a
bit
of
black
pepper
bite
toward
the
end
a
topnotch
example
of
the
style
that
can
go
toetotoe
with
anythign
from
belgium
olike
the
regular
damnation
a
fine
brew
the
wood
flavors
creep
in
ever
so
slightly
and
once
again
there
is
a
solid
hop
backbone
in
the
finish
o
a
nice
beer
to
try
i
like
it
better
than
regular
damnation
nothing
to
get
to
excited
about
though
overpriced
but
not
a
bad
effort
in
an
of
itself
o
a
really
nice
tripel
the
oak
is
not
overdone
and
adds
nice
balance
i
enjoyed
this
more
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
certainly
would
enjoy
more
of
this
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
jd
interesting
beer
i
was
incredibly
excited
until
i
tasted
it
the
taste
is
alright
but
not
great
shrug
a
very
well
crafted
beer
no
doubt
but
i
guess
my
expectations
were
a
bit
unreasonably
raised
given
my
experience
with
the
bottle
version
a
few
years
back
honestly
this
batch
wasnt
all
that
tasty
but
regardless
of
personal
preference
its
well
put
together
had
a
batch
23
750ml
of
this
years
ago
thx
dave
and
it
wasnt
really
the
same
this
was
much
more
estery
and
wine
forward
edit
sampled
on
tap
next
day
at
the
brewpub
also
seemed
a
bit
less
yeasty
and
a
touch
more
drinkable
but
still
had
the
same
dominant
white
wine
flavor
this
is
a
tripel
that
is
light
in
body
yet
complex
in
flavor
i
wish
vinnie
made
this
regularly
instead
of
making
us
wait
through
23
batches
of
regular
damnation
the
regular
edition
of
damnation
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
no
surprise
i
absolutely
love
this
spin
on
the
recipe
this
has
held
amazingly
ultra
smooth
and
integrated
no
alcohol
flavor
the
fruit
has
really
blossomed
drink
em
if
you
got
em
othis
is
great
stuff
not
as
bold
as
their
other
sours
but
a
great
take
on
an
already
pretty
good
beer
very
tasty
im
interested
to
see
how
it
ages
o
well
done
vinne
this
beer
lived
up
to
my
expectations
even
though
ive
been
waiting
for
a
few
years
to
try
it
carbonation
malt
alcohol
and
flavor
all
balanced
very
well
drink
well
greg
i
cant
say
thanks
to
you
enough
never
thought
i
would
see
a
bottle
of
this
and
you
pull
out
likes
it
nothing
till
46
comes
along
i
wait
with
bated
breath
a
far
sweeter
slightly
more
woody
version
than
the
original
damnation
a
different
beer
entirely
in
my
mind
i
prefer
the
original
damnation
o
looking
at
the
reviews
this
beer
is
just
over
4
years
old
time
has
been
very
kind
to
it
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
from
the
next
batch
and
compare
i
also
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
another
one
from
this
batch
check
this
one
out
if
you
can
be
warned
though
the
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
overall
a
very
nice
beer
ive
had
this
many
times
but
am
happy
to
finally
review
it
drinkability
a
rare
treat
thanks
eddie
o
i
wish
this
brew
had
more
of
a
dry
pale
base
because
the
caramel
notes
are
detrimental
for
me
to
an
otherwise
fantastic
beer
pours
a
slightlycloudy
golden
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
bready
malt
and
then
carries
through
with
some
oak
beyond
that
theres
a
good
amount
of
yeast
coming
through
with
nice
notes
of
banana
bubble
gum
and
some
clove
medium
body
light
dryness
from
the
oak
light
booze
in
the
finish
as
well
really
nice
beer
that
i
was
thrilled
to
finally
try
thanks
again
eric
i
should
look
up
to
see
if
rr
calls
this
a
tripel
or
if
this
is
some
ba
nerd
that
added
this
as
a
tripel
in
my
opinion
it
is
too
sweet
and
not
dry
enough
to
be
a
tripel
this
is
probably
better
called
a
strong
pale
or
something
in
that
family
but
i
digress
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
moderately
carbonated
on
the
palate
the
beer
leads
off
with
this
sweetness
and
the
mid
palate
of
the
beer
is
quite
fruity
like
apples
or
white
grapes
some
nice
oak
overall
a
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
not
quite
my
favorite
tripel
or
strong
pale
and
not
my
favorite
russian
river
belgian
ale
but
this
was
really
good
and
id
have
it
again
thanks
madtowndmb1
for
the
opportunity
low
carbonation
but
adequate
to
the
task
a
soft
or
creamy
mouthfeel
excellent
i
liked
this
so
much
better
than
i
expected
im
gonna
save
the
other
bottle
for
another
8
months
or
so
and
see
if
the
oak
diminishes
a
little
even
though
its
delicious
now
pours
a
nice
crisp
yellowish
orange
with
a
nice
amount
of
head
smells
oaky
and
yeasty
lots
of
floral
aromas
and
yeast
but
the
oak
is
most
present
tastes
oaky
oak
oak
and
more
oak
very
nice
yeasty
profile
nice
light
fruity
flavours
incredibly
drinkable
and
very
smooth
so
so
much
better
than
damnation
overy
good
wish
i
could
get
more
poured
from
bottle
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
hazy
effervescent
golden
with
a
dense
white
head
that
retains
throughout
dry
fruity
aroma
with
a
mild
vanilla
oak
presence
some
chalky
belgian
dry
phenols
dry
doughy
yeast
orange
sweet
oak
and
prunes
complex
aroma
fluffy
light
body
with
a
softly
sweet
flavor
the
belgian
malts
dry
out
leading
to
chalky
phenols
some
sweet
ciruses
are
present
as
well
with
mild
vanilla
from
the
oak
all
the
sweet
notes
are
very
soft
and
subtle
with
some
peppery
vegetal
notes
on
the
back
dries
out
nicely
a
nice
u
s
version
of
a
belgian
tripel
glad
to
had
the
batch
23
and
traded
my
last
one
for
a
bunch
of
3f
beers
good
times
drinkability
is
gorgeous
i
really
think
this
is
perhaps
the
most
drinkable
11
beer
ive
had
thus
far
the
style
comes
through
and
it
maintains
all
the
spice
and
dryness
a
triple
should
have
dont
hesitate
if
you
see
this
on
tap
its
a
must
have
home
run
never
experienced
an
american
brewer
nail
a
belgian
style
like
this
before
well
done
medium
bodied
silky
with
medium
levels
of
carbonation
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
oak
is
too
overbearing
for
me
massive
thanks
to
womencantsail
for
this
tick
in
my
quest
to
try
all
of
the
rr
tion
brews
batch
046
served
from
bottle
into
a
firestone
walker
sampler
shaker
poured
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
oak
and
dark
fruit
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
it
had
a
very
different
flavor
than
what
i
was
thinking
it
would
taste
like
the
flavors
present
were
very
nicely
balanced
and
worked
well
together
the
aroma
was
very
nice
as
well
very
glad
that
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
thanks
again
andrew
d
very
different
from
regular
damnation
and
probably
for
the
best
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
would
love
to
have
it
again
poured
golden
orange
in
color
with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thin
frothy
head
and
left
some
good
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
i
did
detect
the
oay
character
upfront
on
the
nose
with
citrus
booze
and
faint
belgian
yeast
notes
the
belgian
yeast
character
and
dark
fruits
were
more
apparent
on
the
palate
with
oaky
and
citrus
accents
but
with
slight
tart
notes
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
citrusy
mild
fruity
oaky
and
tart
finish
i
like
the
regular
damnation
but
batch
23
is
pretty
intresting
and
drank
good
im
glad
ive
got
to
try
it
a
fews
times
now
another
great
show
of
vinnies
barreling
skills
love
russian
river
and
they
never
let
me
down
keep
them
coming
overall
a
pretty
solid
trippel
not
as
oaky
as
i
was
expecting
but
it
didnt
sit
too
long
on
the
chips
it
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
like
it
bottle
batch
46
courtesy
of
mothman
pours
a
deeper
hazed
amber
orange
color
than
the
regular
damnation
the
head
is
a
tiny
bubbled
small
head
of
an
offwhite
color
very
good
retention
and
lacing
as
it
settles
the
nose
is
more
subdued
than
the
regular
version
as
well
but
it
has
notes
of
citrus
pineapple
pear
and
oak
some
booze
notes
as
well
lightmedium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
the
flavor
to
me
is
very
strong
apricot
with
mixes
of
oak
nice
hop
notes
as
well
ends
dryly
very
drinkable
though
i
split
a
glass
with
my
brother
should
have
had
my
own
top
notch
well
worth
it
if
you
can
find
it
drinkability
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
although
the
high
abv
is
well
hidden
quaffable
original
tasty
gorgeous
wonderful
when
i
was
out
in
santa
rosa
i
went
out
to
russian
river
while
i
was
their
i
bought
a
bottle
of
the
damnation
batch
23
i
took
this
to
a
free
the
hops
meeting
i
watched
as
everyone
a
round
the
room
poured
a
sample
and
tasted
with
a
happy
face
when
i
tried
the
beet
it
was
about
straw
in
color
it
had
a
thin
head
the
smell
was
fantastic
sweet
with
hints
of
coriander
the
taste
was
of
carmel
malt
and
vanilla
this
was
a
great
beer
wish
i
had
bought
more
then
just
one
bottle
russian
river
brews
the
single
best
beer
in
the
known
universe
pliny
the
younger
and
plenty
of
others
that
are
special
as
well
damnation
batch
23
is
solid
and
has
aged
well
but
it
isnt
the
outstanding
effort
that
i
was
hoping
for
d
shared
a
750ml
bottle
and
that
was
a
good
serving
size
although
i
could
have
gone
for
a
little
more
d
this
was
much
better
than
the
standard
damnation
it
had
lots
of
rich
complexity
but
was
still
very
delicate
and
refined
fantastic
to
sip
with
the
only
negative
being
that
its
still
a
bit
hot
perhaps
another
year
of
age
to
perfect
it
thanks
jeff
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
and
many
other
rr
beers
d
very
very
drinkable
beware
with
the
alcohol
dthis
is
tasty
lighter
and
soft
on
the
palate
fantastic
beer
and
quite
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
the
oak
falls
off
a
little
in
the
taste
but
was
still
a
great
brew
russian
river
has
not
disappointed
me
yet
except
their
distribution
habits
d
overall
this
beer
is
kinda
quirkybut
awesome
i
love
the
complexity
and
the
spicy
heat
that
the
flavor
profile
provides
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
as
this
is
completely
different
from
regular
damnationbut
still
great
brew
by
rr
the
palate
opens
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
bite
and
prominent
juicy
fruity
character
with
citrus
pears
and
ripe
apricots
moderate
vanilla
comes
through
midpalate
and
coupled
with
the
rather
big
alcohol
character
it
makes
me
think
of
what
a
good
flavored
vodka
would
taste
like
mild
spice
character
midpalate
with
a
little
clove
a
little
pepper
not
particularly
yeasty
while
a
little
sweet
this
beer
dries
up
quite
well
on
the
finish
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
particularly
excellent
with
a
blend
of
fruit
spice
and
drying
tannins
vinnie
does
not
disappoint
this
is
going
to
fuck
me
up
but
its
going
to
be
a
pleasant
trip
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
citrus
both
lemon
and
orange
with
some
oaked
character
the
flavor
is
orange
oak
lemon
and
a
nice
dose
of
vanilla
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
unless
you
look
at
the
label
you
would
have
no
idea
this
beer
was
11
percent
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
love
this
beer
and
its
ridiculous
that
an
11
abv
beer
is
this
drinkable
sweeter
than
most
tripels
but
balanced
by
the
oak
a
wonderful
beer
overall
i
didnt
pick
up
on
any
huge
differences
between
this
and
normal
damnation
however
the
nose
in
this
one
was
a
bit
more
robust
worth
a
shot
it
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
and
left
a
massive
lace
it
smelled
like
citrus
earthy
yeasty
some
spicy
hops
mixed
in
with
some
banana
and
clove
it
tasted
a
bit
sweet
at
first
with
a
little
grainy
with
a
spicy
hop
flavor
slightly
bubblegum
banana
some
light
oak
notes
the
alcohol
seemed
to
be
pretty
well
hidden
in
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
retains
all
the
qualities
that
make
a
great
triple
but
then
ads
a
great
uniqueness
with
the
oak
d
this
one
fits
the
bill
for
a
tripel
and
is
a
very
enjoyable
drink
it
is
deceptive
in
that
it
is
not
too
heavy
in
the
end
though
this
one
is
best
enjoyed
when
aged
for
an
extended
period
of
time
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
slight
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
thanks
to
chris
for
giving
me
a
chance
to
try
this
d
drinkabillity
is
good
with
this
beer
there
is
a
sweetness
that
is
a
little
annoying
but
you
almost
get
used
to
it
by
the
end
of
the

but
not
over
the
top
with
wood
sticky
and
slightly
dead
vegetal
hops
in
the
back
this
version
also
has
a
big
hot
boozy
oak
note
that
dominates
the
front
aroma
quadrant
taste
si
big
with
the
oak
and
alcohol
head
peach
highly
recommended
if
you
can
track
down
a
bottle
and
sweet
citrus
spices
and
some
pepper
also
emerge
as
well
as
a
tingle
of
honey
in
the
nose
a
tiny
hint
of
wood
also
mixes
in
throughout
after
the
first
sip
with
the
front
being
the
sweetspice
area
just
a
light
dusting
of
wood
and
vanilla
body
pours
a
brilliant
and
well
carbonated
gilded
copper
with
a
2
inch
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
steady
but
thin
lace
loads
of
butter
in
the
aroma
like
a
california
chardonnay
taste
is
sweet
and
boozey
orange
and
sweet
apples
it
is
just
that
i
see
this
getting
a
lot
better

flavor
poured
a
nice
golden
color
but
not
much
head
i
detected
belgian
candi
sugars
raisins
alcohol
and
medicinal

taste
is
fruity
as
in
green
grapes
medicinal
and
perhaps
slightly
too
boozy
for
my
taste
a
dry
finish
leaves
a
phenolic
aftertaste
strong
carbonation
full
bodied
and
very
alcoholic
especially
as
it
warms
this
is
a
sipper
given
the
high
abv
the
alcohol
does
produce
a
nice
warming
effect
not
a
bad
belgian
style
american
made
ale
however
it
has
its
flaws
excellent
belgium
style
ale
worth
the
price
poured
well
fresh
fruity
aroma
and
a
great
solid
taste
with
hints
of
spice
but
not
overpoweringly
spicy
nice
beer
to
have
for
a
few
slowly
quaffed
brews
this
is
one
of
my
local
nj
favorites
tasty
sweetness
from
a
bottle
10
is
an
added
perk
just
saw
someone
reviewed
this
beer
and
gave
it
low
scores
because
they
dont
really
like
belgian
beers
not
sure
why
they
would
even
review
it
then
of
course
its
not
an
ancient
monk
recipe
from
belgium
but
if
you
actually
like
a
belgian
style
beer
give
this
one
a
shot
best
tasting
beer
ever
all
you
need
is
2
and
your
done
thought
it
was
good
but
im
just
not
a
belgian
fan
this
beer
has
a
frothy
but
not
too
heady
pour
its
initial
look
is
a
warm
almost
sensual
honey
and
cream
coloring
the
aroma
after
the
initial
pour
is
a
typical
belgian
style
ale
with
a
spice
and
fruit
accent
that
draws
the
imbiber
in
as
you
drink
you
become
aware
of
hints
of
vanilla
and
clove
from
the
malt
and
a
hops
kick
near
the
end
in
your
mouth
is
a
smooth
almost
lush
caress
of
your
tongue
and
gentle
wash
of
your
palate
just
bear
in
mind
the
10
abv
can
provide
a
real
kick
to
those
not
familiar
with
the
higher
abv
that
can
be
found
in
belgian
and
such
styled
ales
this
is
hardly
a
chugging
bear
it
is
the
beer
you
enjoy
amongst
friends
over
an
hour
or
two
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
very
smooth
and
delicious
it
is
one
that
even
people
who
do
not
like
beer
would
probably
enjoy
it
is
dangerous
though
at
10
it
can
hit
you
hard
so
you
have
to
be
careful
with
it
i
hope
to
see
riverhorse
able
to
distribute
nationwide
sometime
soon
tasty
but
sweet
not
my
style
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
this
is
one
of
the
single
best
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
its
got
a
beautiful
color
a
rich
taste
and
a
smooth
finish
for
a
beer
thats
10
abv
i
love
this
beer
overalldrinkability
quaffable
mild
not
a
sipping
beer
a
little
too
sweet
for
the
style
even
with
6
months
of
age
on
it
but
not
at
a
bad
beer
at
all
hides
the
abv
well
and
has
a
nice
light
refreshing
body
lots
of
flavors
and
hidden
complexities
as
well
with
bubble
gum
being
very
prominant
it
wasnt
bad
and
yet
it
didnt
meet
my
expectations
i
drank
it
but
can
say
i
wont
get
it
again
great
tasting
tripel
that
sneaks
up
at
10
this
can
be
deadly
i
am
from
nj
and
could
not
image
a
smooth
10
abv
to
come
from
ewing
nj
but
river
horse
does
a
nice
job
here
beer
has
a
nice
smooth
taste
appearance
is
very
good
and
has
a
great
appearance
mouthfeel
shows
the
belgium
style
ale
went
down
very
smooth
would
purchase
again
saw
this
on
the
shelf
with
4
varieties
of
river
horse
went
for
the
high
test
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
very
sweet
malt
aroma
with
some
spice
pours
to
a
translucent
deep
orange
with
a
wispy
head
that
fades
fast
on
the
taste
the
first
thing
that
hits
is
the
mouthfeel
this
brew
is
syrup
thick
on
the
taste
there
is
a
sweet
fruitiness
with
citrus
and
banana
esters
consistent
taste
throughout
then
the
real
flavor
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
a
little
bite
of
very
slightly
bitterness
mostly
tart
and
a
sense
of
the
abv
that
this
brew
packs
but
it
still
remains
very
hidden
an
extremely
smooth
drinker
too
smooth
though
in
that
it
doesnt
have
much
going
on
and
that
with
a
10
abv
is
a
stealth
bender
i
need
a
westmalle
to
redeem
myself
not
spectacular
but
decent
ono
reason
to
have
this
beer
be
10
the
alcohol
throws
off
the
rest
of
the
flavors
hurting
what
could
have
a
good
beer
almost
perfect
belgian
triple
in
my
book
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
murky
viscous
appearance
poured
with
a
short
dense
white
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
medium
bodied
with
rich
tangy
slightly
subdued
carbonation
sweet
banana
and
yeasty
aromas
with
spicy
corriander
notes
sweet
banana
flavors
and
yeast
up
front
transitioning
to
tangy
spices
through
the
middle
spicy
corriander
and
yeast
flavors
intensify
from
the
middle
to
end
finishes
with
a
heavy
yeasty
aftertaste
btwit
looked
fantastic
in
my
duval
glass
now
this
is
a
winter
beer
though
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
it
at
other
times
too
loaded
up
on
alcoholic
goodness
excellent
for
piling
up
the
beer
sweaters
but
careful
cuz
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
10er
pours
an
opaque
golden
amber
brown
sugar
honey
gold
crisp
carbonatey
and
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
taste
is
ruddy
very
balanced
malty
enough
for
anyones
liking
but
not
overdone
i
really
like
it
certainly
not
a
session
beer
and
not
just
cuz
of
the
awesome
abv
its
like
a
fine
desert
in
how
rich
it
is
but
perfect
on
a
snowy
day
like
today
if
gingerbread
men
could
drink
this
would
be
their
beer
cuz
their
not
gonna
drink
ginger
beer
thatd
be
canabalism
cheers
bottle
to
brooklyn
tulip
at
brass
rail
in
hoboken
my
first
new
jersey
rate
pours
a
murky
yellowish
orange
with
a
small
ring
of
white
head
aroma
of
banana
clove
yeast
booze
pears
flavor
follows
similarly
with
banana
clove
spiciness
pear
apple
honey
yeast
very
very
sweet
and
boozy
for
the
style
but
a
mix
sipper
heavyish
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
an
interesting
interpretation
of
a
tripel
and
a
bit
on
the
boozy
side
but
not
too
bad
worth
a
try
especially
for
ticking
jersey
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
could
have
taken
both
its
sweet
and
spicy
flavors
down
a
notch
to
create
more
of
a
balance
im
all
for
experimental
brews
but
this
wasnt
so
much
creative
as
it
was
out
of
whack
for
lack
of
a
better
term
i
did
feel
however
that
my
reaction
was
quite
subjective
and
this
could
be
someone
elses
absolute
cup
of
spiked
tea
overall
not
bad
for
under
3
bucks
for
a
single
a
very
flavorful
high
octane
belgium
ale
that
may
not
be
traditional
but
is
still
very
well
crafted
and
delicious
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
by
the
vanillabubblegum
flavours
and
i
managed
to
finish
my
pint
without
any
undue
problem
but
ill
never
have
another
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
smells
of
brown
sugar
and
bananas
sweet
and
malty
on
the
fore
with
no
lingering
kick
from
the
high
abv
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
loved
my
first
experience
with
tripel
horse
but
will
have
to
try
it
again
to
dive
in
a
little
deeper
tasty
and
strong
americanstyle
version
of
a
tripel
that
isnt
quite
a
tripel
but
its
still
a
decent
brew
brewed
with
spices
but
hardly
tastes
like
it
hardly
worth
explaining
let
alone
trying
or
even
finishing
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
little
head
developed
came
and
went
fast
no
lacing
10abv
appearance
is
cloudy
and
dark
yellow
to
orange
in
color
aroma
has
some
grain
and
citrus
notes
not
very
potent
aroma
taste
was
gummy
with
citrus
notes
orange
also
a
taste
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
not
creamy
just
heavy
aftertaste
of
alcohol
a
nice
tripel
nothing
mind
blowing
overall
decent
more
like
a
double
belgian
wit
but
that
can
pass
as
a
tripel
these
days
since
most
american
brewers
seem
to
think
that
that
is
what
a
tripel
means
however
well
done
wheat
spices
citrus
nice
esters
and
phenols
and
nice
booze
warmth
river
horse
tripel
horse
pours
a
mildly
opaque
orange
with
a
few
tangerine
highlights
a
slightly
aggressive
pour
yields
two
fingers
of
frothy
white
foam
quickly
rising
up
and
spilling
out
of
the
glass
a
little
bit
head
retention
is
decent
but
theres
not
much
lacing
left
at
all
theres
a
little
bit
of
banana
bubblegum
to
the
nose
with
some
delicate
nutmeg
aromas
providing
a
bit
of
balance
there
are
some
peachy
stone
fruit
and
banana
flavors
to
greet
my
palate
before
a
warming
booze
and
the
more
citrus
coriander
notes
set
it
the
nutmeg
and
clove
finish
is
very
subtle
the
balance
just
isnt
there
for
me
though
its
too
much
fruit
and
citrus
thats
not
offset
enough
by
the
nutmeg
and
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
mediocre
for
a
belgian
style
beer
the
body
is
to
flabby
but
just
by
a
bit
the
real
issue
is
in
the
carbonation
which
is
noticeably
lacking
in
its
liveliness
tripel
horse
is
an
alright
brew
but
its
not
a
great
belgian
style
beer
and
its
probably
not
even
the
best
tripel
brewed
in
the
state
which
would
be
flying
fish
exit
4
mouthfeel
soft
carbonation
heavy
body
very
soft
but
the
heat
is
slightly
off
putting
o
average
tripel
i
was
not
impressed
by
the
smell
or
taste
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
i
enjoy
that
much
sweet
taste
like
a
banana
split
like
blue
moon
on
steriods
love
this
beer
i
like
my
beers
less
hopped
this
stuff
is
almost
like
mead
its
a
belgian
style
tripel
but
it
doesnt
say
what
the
base
is
i
presume
its
wheat
based
just
went
to
their
website
says
pilsen
white
wheat
and
caramel
15
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
tried
in
a
while
overall
this
is
just
a
subpar
example
of
a
belgian
style
ale
too
boozy
and
phenolic
and
just
a
pass
for
me
going
forward
this
is
a
dry
beer
that
drinks
very
easily
when
you
factor
in
the
10
abv
you
have
to
really
watch
yourself
or
you
could
end
up
feeling
the
effects
quickly
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
enjoying
it
again

although
it
is
quite
boozy
overall
id
recommend
skipping
this
one
no
one
can
be
great
at
all
things
o
an
alright
tripel
though
nothing
special
even
with
a
decanted
pour
the
yeast
dominates
the
nose
and
palate
itd
be
nice
to
have
more
balance
and
depth
as
well
as
a
higher
attenuation
pours
a

medium

with

and
a

almost
sugary
mouthfeel
decent
flavorful
tripel
but
a
bit
rough
with
alcohol
burn
overall
great
tripleish
beer
though
keep
in
mind
the
10
abv
you
want
to
be
careful
drinking
too
many
at
one
time
also
due
to
the
strength
it
does
get
smoother
with
age
o
is
there
such
a
thing
as
an
imperial
hefeweizen
doesnt
taste
like
a
typical
tripel
but
i
like
it
alot
o
glad
i
got
it
as
an
extra
but
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
on
purpose
seems
flat
maybe
a
touch
oily
and
the
spice
dominates
the
belgian
yeast
a
little
too
much
mothere
is
a
creamy
feel
overall
a
good
beer
but
there
are
so
many
very
good
tripels
around
id
got
for
it
again
odive
had
all
of
the
beers
from
this
brewerys
variety
pack
this
like
the
others
is
just
another
notch
in
the
belt
had
the
guys
at
riverhorse
tried
to
not
like
this
delicious
brew
with
a
style
it
does
no
justice
too
i
wouldve
given
it
a
higher
score
overall
this
seems
like
a
semisessionable
beer
but
there
would
be
a
world
of
drunk
waiting
for
you
after
one
i
feel
like
i
drank
one
tastier
blue
moon
but
feel
tipsy
like
i
drank
3
very
enjoyable
i
cant
compare
it
much
to
other
tripels
cause
ive
never
had
a
real
one
before
however
this
is
a
above
averagenear
perfect
brew
impress
your
friends
with
this
and
see
them
get
hammered
cause
the
alcohol
taste
is
almost
non
existent
will
definitely
buy
more
especially
cause
the
brewery
is
45
mins
away
from
me
had
this
in
the
cellar
a
good
two
and
three
years
and
even
that
couldnt
save
it
hot
simple
and
unsubtle
river
horse
just
dont
do
great
work
certainly
not
a
session
beer
at
10
and
flavor
wise
this
beer
is
more
for
sipping
solid
not
must
have
overall
this
beer
is
far
from
perfect
but
i
find
the
spicing
welcoming
summer
is
turning
into
fall
here
so
maybe
the
clouds
and
drizzle
are
making
me
appreciate
it
more
in
any
case
this
is
a
tripel
id
have
again
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
golden
yellow
color
pretty
big
fluffy
white
head
on
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
decent
wheat
like
aromas
and
a
little
bit
of
spices
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
wasnt
too
bad
i
found
that
it
was
pretty
close
to
what
i
would
consider
a
good
tripel
some
of
the
flavors
were
a
little
off
which
is
understandable
the
mouthfeel
was
also
decent
found
it
to
have
a
good
body
and
was
drinkable
overall
its
an
above
average
tripel
wouldnt
need
to
have
it
again
though
overall
id
call
this
an
average
triple
yeast
scents
and
flavors
are
solid
but
a
little
two
sweet
in
the
flavor
profile
pretty
darn
good
trippel
not
the
best
ever
but
hits
the
spot
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
strength
tastes
more
like
an
imperial
wit
than
a
trippel
to
be
honest
will
seek
this
out
again
as
this
beer
was
tasty
complex
and
hid
the
alcohol
almost
completely
this
gets
extra
points
for
hiding
that
10
abv
so
well
behind
an
enjoyable
flavor
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
however
it
didnt
taste
like
a
classic
tripel
style
like
a
good
tripel
it
brilliantly
masked
the
high
abv
but
it
wasnt
as
light
bodied
as
i
would
expect
and
drank
more
like
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
final
thoughts
its
alright
it
meets
alot
of
the
things
that
i
would
consider
of
the
style
so
i
guess
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
just
not
my
bag
i
suppose
good
bannana
nose
though
the
tripel
is
pretty
mediocre
flavor
wise
it
has
some
malt
flavor
but
mostly
it
just
tastes
sweet
and
simple
with
a
yeasty
tropical
accent
which
comes
off
as
ripe
banana
with
a
dash
of
spice
the
flavor
turns
to
alcohol
pretty
rapidly
which
is
not
quite
like
pure
alcohol
but
doesnt
really
do
anything
to
help
matters
i
would
only
recommend
this
if
you
have
to
try
it
because
i
have
had
more
than
enough
of
this
my
wife
would
not
split
the
bottle
since
i
had
to
drink
12oz
myself
overall
im
in
the
middle
ground
it
is
not
the
best
tripel
i
have
had
but
it
certainly
is
not
the
worst
the
crafting
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
sloppy
in
that
i
think
the
sweetness
is
too
strong
and
the
10
is
not
hidden
as
well
as
it
could
be
quite
drinkable
as
a
bedtime
sip
or
late
night
with
cold
pizza
say
quite
creamy
and
mouthfilling
when
you
pour
another
inch
after
its
been
open
a
while
overall
an
ehh
for
me
i
have
had
much
better
in
the
style
for
sure
o
i
am
originally
from
new
jersey
and
i
wanted
to
try
to
support
state
owned
microbrews
i
was
curious
how
this
tripel
would
taste
and
now
i
know
the
smell
is
decent
though
honey
dominates
the
aroma
profile
the
taste
is
also
okay
it
has
a
lot
of
different
flavors
it
also
has
a
lot
of
alcohol
typically
tripels
have
a
lot
of
alcohol
however
the
better
tripels
balance
the
beer
so
well
the
alcohol
is
not
obvious
this
is
not
the
case
with
this
beer
it
is
not
a
beer
that
is
so
bad
that
it
is
not
drinkable
however
there
are
a
lot
of
other
delicious
tripels
for
roughly
the
same
price
you
will
not
be
angry
if
you
buy
this
beer
but
it
is
not
a
beer
to
buy
again
on
the
whole
a
solid
example
of
the
tripel
style
its
not
going
to
wow
you
if
youve
had
better
but
its
a
good
ontap
substitution
if
youre
craving
a
good
belgianstyle
beer
amidst
the
litany
of
bmc
product
like
i
was
m
the
mouthfeel
is
low
on
carbonation
allowing
the
relaxed
flavors
to
linger
just
a
little
while
longer
on
tap
at
a
beer
festival
poured
into
a
sampler
glass
from
notes
moderate
notes
of
grain
lemon
and
perfume
for
the
malt
and
hops
light
to
moderate
dough
and
soap
for
the
yeast
with
hints
of
clove
in
the
background
head
is
small
frothy
whole
with
good
lacing
and
is
mostly
lasting
color
is
mostly
clear
yellow
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
to
start
and
finishes
moderately
sweet
and
a
touch
bitter
palate
is
light
to
medium
creamy
and
has
a
soft
carbonation
a
pretty
good
abbey
tripel
that
leans
a
little
to
much
on
the
sweet
side
o
decent
belgian
knock
off
worth
a
try
easy
drinking
with
an
eye
on
the
occasional
hotness
this
made
for
a
great
serving
very
smooth
mouthfeel
although
higher
carbonation
the
bit
of
age
has
mellowed
any
alcohol
bite
that
it
might
have
had
this
is
quite
a
easy
drinking
beer
for
a
ten
percenter
taste
is
really
good
feels
really
nice
in
the
mouth
i
wish
i
had
one
more
of
these
to
enjoy
but
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
overall
grade
bb
its
got
the
yeast
characteristics
i
seek
out
in
tripels
but
the
10
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
it
goes
down
smooth
with
nice
floral
and
banana
notes
ales
brewed
with
spices
are
often
overpowered
by
their
spices
but
not
here
where
the
application
is
subtle
d
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
american
tripel
easy
drinker
with
a
manageable
alcohol
component
as
a
fellow
new
jerseyian
i
find
the
tripel
horse
to
be
a
pretty
decent
beer
for
such
an
alcoholic
beer
it
is
rather
drinkable
and
i
get
hints
of
coriander
and
lemon
in
the
beer
i
would
get
this
beer
again
and
i
am
proud
it
comes
from
the
garden
state
m
chewy
and
sticky
this
cloudy
brew
is
complex
and
interesting
i
think
the
biggest
difference
between
this
beer
and
the
best
in
its
class
is
the
easily
identifiable
alcohol
it
is
still
easy
to
drink
especially
for
10percent
if
my
attention
needs
to
go
nowhere
else
then
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
this
is
my
favorite
or
river
horse
beers
and
i
am
very
happy
to
live
within
walking
distance
of
them
the
brewery
tour
they
give
is
informative
and
tasty
smells
fruity
and
sweet
when
poured
belgian
style
with
hints
of
coriander
and
nutmeg
not
too
flavorful
very
alcoholic
smooth
and
spicy
local
nj
brew
there
are
moments
of
belgian
tripel
in
this
beer
but
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
that
makes
it
difficult
to
find
d
its
difficult
to
rate
drinkability
in
a
10
abv
beer
but
as
far
as
it
goes
this
is
on
a
par
with
the
belgian
beers
i
had
in
europe
this
summer
d
drinks
a
little
too
easy
for
10
abv
just
sayin
it
tastes
boozy
and
has
a
nice
little
burn
but
it
taste
good
and
its
easyt
o
get
carried
away
could
only
dirnk
one
or
two
before
wanting
to
move
on
overall
the
beer
was
pretty
good
i
wasnt
amazed
by
it
and
there
are
definitly
better
triples
out
there
mouthfeel
was
vibrant
and
creamy
alcoholic
and
slightly
burny
but
not
too
agressive
i
think
ill
give
my
other
one
some
time
and
see
how
it
transforms
overall
pretty
tasty
but
i
cant
drink
more
than
one
of
these
without
getting
a
little
silly
i
tend
to
avoid
doubledigit
alcohol
beers
because
things
aint
pretty
when
im
silly
this
is
a
nice
drinking
brew
tasty
and
sweet
had
it
ice
cold
and
the
sweet
was
to
much
for
me
but
50
degrees
and
this
one
comes
home
the
high
octain
is
absoltely
invisable
and
it
just
gets
better
as
visit
goes
on
like
to
age
this
just
to
see
if
it
changes
at
all
drinkability
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
tripel
its
not
as
yeasty
as
id
expect
a
tripel
to
be
nor
does
it
have
the
green
orchard
fruit
flavors
i
like
in
my
favorite
tripels
but
that
being
said
im
enjoying
this
beer
and
it
makes
up
for
some
of
its
defects
by
being
quite
pleasant
to
drink
with
this
abv
it
is
a
one
a
night
beer
that
ill
probably
have
again
one
day
but
its
not
the
first
tripel
id
reach
for
while
shopping
of
course
this
packs
a
wallop
in
terms
of
the
alcohol
but
thats
to
be
expected
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
that
has
more
to
do
with
the
style
than
how
this
beer
was
brewed
while
not
the
best
trippel
out
there
its
nice
to
see
a
new
jersey
brewer
give
this
a
go
and
for
an
occasional
foray
into
something
rare
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
at
all
calling
this
a
tripel
is
a
stretch
as
without
a
doubt
its
closer
to
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
phenols
and
esters
bring
it
to
that
level
perhaps
we
are
splitting
hairs
here
well
simply
deem
this
beer
worthy
of
a
try
this
isnt
too
bad
and
could
probably
be
a
very
good
american
tripel
if
it
were
using
a
better
yeast
strain
i
just
want
to
see
some
more
belgian
yeast
character
the
fruit
and
spice
notes
are
nice
and
the
level
of
sweetness
is
good
some
more
yeastderived
complexity
and
this
could
be
a
very
good
american
tripel
nice
mouthfeel
not
to
light
or
heavy
just
right
and
perfect
for
a
nice
cool
night
like
tonight
the
harsh
finish
makes
this
a
good
sipper
but
one
is
plenty
for
me
drinkabililty
not
for
me
a
tripel
horse
what
an
abomination
of
nature
it
pours
a
hazy
amberishstraw
topped
by
a
quicklyfading
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
straight
tripel
comprising
pepper
belgiany
yeast
cardamom
a
hint
of
coriander
and
citrus
peel
and
wheat
the
taste
generally
follows
though
the
usual
spiciness
is
drowned
out
by
a
wave
of
citrusy
wheat
this
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
the
smell
led
me
to
believe
other
things
were
coming
to
me
the
body
is
a
nice
medium
with
a
lightish
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
not
the
best
tripel
out
there
there
seems
to
be
a
lack
of
the
necessary
spice
and
tripelness
something
like
that
dnot
good
at
all
the
alcohol
is
way
too
present
and
im
pretty
sure
thats
what
is
ruining
this
beer
for
me
i
cant
get
by
the
alcohol
it
totally
overwhelms
the
rest
of
the
flavors
in
this
beer
things
seemed
so
promising
based
on
the
nose
d
a
decent
sipping
brew
but
lots
of
alcohol
taste
d
drinkable
tripel
a
little
less
boozy
and
this
beer
probably
would
have
gotten
a
4
0
in
the
drinkability
category
d
you
definitely
need
to
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
to
appreciate
it
triples
are
meant
to
be
slowly
enjoyed
but
this
is
relatively
easy
to
consume
since
it
comes
in
12
ounce
bottles
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
25cl
chalice
the
beer
has
a
tarnished
golden
hue
somewhere
between
dirty
straw
and
copper
there
was
a
modest
white
foam
head
that
has
settled
down
a
bit
leaving
a
thing
coat
of
tiny
bubbles
there
is
some
patchy
lacing
i
can
see
a
lot
of
carbonation
within
the
glass
there
is
a
yeasty
and
fruity
aroma
to
the
beer
there
may
be
a
hint
of
vanilla
in
there
as
well
there
is
certainly
some
vanilla
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
alcohol
sweet
sugars
and
an
overall
creaminess
i
like
the
creamy
character
but
there
is
something
about
the
alcohol
aftertaste
that
i
do
not
like
very
much
it
also
leaves
a
bit
of
a
mouthcoating
that
is
characterized
by
the
leftover
carbonation
bubbles
sticking
to
my
tongue
it
has
a
medium
body
and
leaves
some
stickiness
on
my
lips
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
as
i
mentioned
i
dont
like
the
aftertaste
too
much
but
besides
that
i
am
enjoying
this
glass
i
dont
think
id
go
for
more
than
one
bottle
there
are
more
easily
sessionable
tripels
available
to
me
that
id
rather
go
for
such
as
allagash
or
karmeliet
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
slightly
more
than
an
affligem
that
i
had
last
night
seems
to
be
more
complex
but
perhaps
that
is
why
i
enjoy
it
more
whereas
the
affligem
tripel
is
a
little
more
nutty
clean
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
fruits
and
yeast
taste
is
good
fruits
malts
a
touch
of
alcohol
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fine
quality
brew
d
smells
good
tastes
good
and
goes
down
as
smooth
as
a
10
abv
brew
can
from
looking
at
the
reviews
i
sense
we
are
reviewing
different
batches
from
this
small
brewery
drinkability
is
pretty
good
take
a
decent
belgian
tripel
and
soak
a
few
hops
in
it
and
you
get
this
overall
a
winner
d
this
one
has
a
warmth
that
is
a
bit
harsh
and
somewhat
more
sour
than
sweet
as
a
tripel
should
be
it
is
drinkable
but
needs
some
mellowing
it
poured
nicely
into
a
sniffer
glass
leaving
about
a
finger
of
awsome
and
tasty
white
head
color
deep
amber
the
sweet
taste
doesnt
stay
with
young
which
i
like
this
is
by
far
the
best
riverhorse
i
have
had
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
think
i
would
maybe
another
trip
to
the
brewery
is
in
order
overall
a
very
nice
if
sweet
tripel
leaves
a
wonderful
banana
aroma
in
the
mouth
after
drunk
my
first
brew
from
river
horse
and
i
must
say
that
it
exceeded
my
expectations
like
i
said
ive
had
a
few
other
tripels
that
i
have
enjoyed
this
is
not
one
of
them
appearance
is
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
nearly
three
finger
head
in
the
wide
wine
glass
that
i
poured
it
into
nice
onto
the
smell
a
familiar
scent
subtle
malt
some
citrus
aroma
along
with
a
sweetness
taste
consists
of
yeast
spice
wine
and
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
to
me
is
a
bit
richer
than
the
rest
of
the
characteristics
of
this
offering
from
river
horse
the
yeast
and
the
heavy
alcohol
content
linger
for
a
bit
drinkability
on
this
tripel
is
good
but
not
as
easy
as
some
other
out
there
i
say
try
this
if
you
run
into
it
on
your
local
shelf
on
tap
at
the
ginger
man
pours
a
deep
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
aroma
of
floral
hops
and
light
fruits
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
belgian
yeast
and
candi
sugar
hmm
despite
the
commercial
description
i
thought
this
was
a
bit
sweet
on
the
heavy
side
with
its
10
abv
good
tripel
drinkability
as
far
as
belgian
tripels
go
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
a
tasty
beer
to
be
sure
but
at
10
abv
a
tought
one
to
come
back
to
i
enjoyed
my
one
and
then
called
it
a
night
this
stuff
is
crap
with
a
capital
c
i
want
the
17
00
that
i
spent
on
the
six
pack
back
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
thin
grainy
and
phenolic
sweet
with
rosewater
and
orange
the
flavor
tastes
of
molasses
and
ginger
like
a
liquid
gingersnap
with
a
strange
almost
disengaged
bitterness
elements
of
orange
and
a
bit
of
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
pleasant
the
alcohol
burns
a
bit
on
the
finish
but
is
otherwise
well
balanced
d
prefer
the
overall
taste
and
balance
of
the
double
but
this
one
is
still
very
good
overall
citric
flavors
maintain
throughout
this
rather
masked
tripeli
am
blushed
but
not
smashed
by
its
abv
with
a
true
lack
of
afteburn
turns
a
bit
fruity
at
its
end
and
the
only
knock
i
have
is
its
lack
of
a
truly
pronounced
signature
trait
a
great
add
to
their
rather
drinkable
twelvepack
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
2
fingers
of
sticky
foam
nose
is
grapefruit
apple
pineapples
and
mangos
hints
of
grass
pine
and
toffee
as
well
very
fragrant
strong
apple
flavour
up
front
with
resinous
grapefruit
in
the
back
sweet
with
alcohol
sneaking
through
on
warming
well
balanced
bitterness
substantial
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
hard
carbonation
definitely
a
sipper
and
leaning
towards
the
sweet
side
this
may
not
have
the
real
taste
of
a
tribel
but
its
a
good
start
and
for
the
price
the
10
helps
drinking
one
or
two
of
these
d
enjoyed
it
however
much
of
the
beer
is
not
to
style
of
a
belgian
triple
but
then
again
that
seems
like
the
growing
trend
anyway
i
havent
really
enjoyed
any
of
the
tripels
ive
tried
but
this
ones
pretty
decent
its
still
a
little
off
in
my
opinion
and
i
doubt
id
want
any
more
but
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
this
glass
overall
not
too
shabby
river
horse
is
getting
much
stronger
these
days
blipped
king
horse
by
elvis
costello
out
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
into
my
maredsous
chalice
appears
a
hazed
copper
color
with
about
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
bone
white
head
aromas
and
flavors
are
of
spicy
yeast
apples
fruity
esters
and
sweet
malt
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
for
a
tripel
which
led
to
a
higher
than
average
drinkability
for
me
i
have
few
complaints
with
river
horses
tripel
i
love
the
aroma
and
i
really
like
the
taste
id
buy
this
regularly
if
i
could
it
doesnt
drink
exactly
like
a
classic
belgian
tripel
but
its
a
lot
closer
than
many
american
microbreweries
have
come
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
to
the
recipe
with
a
little
bit
more
attention
to
detail
this
could
be
one
of
the
best
i
cant
really
find
anything
wrong
with
the
mouthfeel
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
job
river
horse
really
digging
the
label
art
my
first
review
but
not
my
first
beer
i
thought
it
tasted
great
on
its
own
merits
as
an
american
belgian
triplestyle
without
the
price
tag
and
from
a
local
for
me
source
i
found
it
exceptional
it
paired
great
with
whatever
food
i
put
it
with
and
it
has
a
nice
complexity
on
its
own
very
drinkable
not
too
sweet
like
alot
of
americam
made
belgian
style
triples
will
definitly
have
this
one
again
m
personally
like
the
mouth
feel
it
makes
you
stand
up
and
notice
this
beer
this
isnt
grandpas
bud
and
it
tells
you
that
with
this
is
a
big
beer
i
dont
know
how
to
take
it
to
be
honest
it
has
good
traits
and
bad
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurts
it
the
flavor
is
nice
sweet
and
fruity
but
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
much
id
give
this
one
another
go
though
i
wouldnt
place
it
at
the
top
of
my
preferences
its
not
the
most
beautifullooking
beer
though
interesting
to
look
at
perhaps
a
mystic
could
use
it
to
read
fortunes
in
the
suspended
matter
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orange
with
a
great
big
white
head
smells
are
very
fruity
sweet
and
spicy
with
big
orange
zest
element
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
making
its
presence
known
very
fruitforward
on
the
palate
bubblegummy
quite
sweet
a
bit
too
sweet
for
anything
but
tiny
sips
but
undeniably
tasty
i
especially
like
the
aggressively
spicy
finish
body
is
very
lively
with
carbonation
crackling
like
electricity
before
smoothing
out
as
you
mull
it
around
a
very
welcome
companion
during
this
snowy
weather
were
having
in
dc
what
an
outstanding
triple
from
an
american
brewery
and
for
the
price
its
hard
to
beat
pick
some
up
and
try
it
not
terrible
simply
not
what
i
look
for
at
all
in
a
tripel
and
is
simply
a
bit
off
style
to
me
mouthfeel
is
pretty
average
its
a
little
bit
too
carbonated
but
medium
bodied
and
with
a
good
consistency
astringent

really
enjoyed

the

but
not
quite
up

with
most
triples
slight
alcohol
finish
but
not
overpowering
according
to
the
bottle
aging
can
contribute
to
the
quality
of
the
beer
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
example
of
style
good
for
the
beer
rookies
trying
to
get
into
different
styles
overall
not
a
perfect
tripel
by
any
means
but
a
nice
attempt
at
one
a
little
to
much
on
the
sweet
side
and
the
alcohol
is
a
little
more
noticable
than
i
would
like
the
label
recommends
letting
it
sit
some
time
i
wonder
if
aging
would
do
anymore
justice
to
this
beer
keeping
one
in
the
cellar
to
see
if
this
holds
true
honeyamber
color
thin
slightly
offwhite

alcohol
flavors
are
the
same
with
prickly
carbonation
medium
body
and
a
maltyalcohol
sweet
finish
tempered
by
some
spicy
bitterness
the
alcohol
isnt
on
every
sip
though
so
every
few
sips
i
find
that
i
like
this
not
so
much
in
between
this
hippo
is
easy
to
consume
but
far
less
complex
than
should
be
expected
from
this
style
still
it
is
enjoyable
and
worth
visiting
again
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
tripel
you
can
do
better
the
body
is
a
clear
gold
with
a
short
white
hed
all
good
so
far
the
aroma
is
a
bit
odd
with
fresh
cut
apples
with
spice
the
flavor
has
more
of
the
apple
with
light
clove
with
an
odd
malt
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
extract
beer
still
the
drinkability
of
this
10
brew
is
quite
good
unfortunately
the
flavor
doesnt
make
me
want
to
continue
drinkability
of
a
10
abv
brew
highly
likely
what
more
can
be
said
nose
had
slight
vanilla
undertones
and
finishes
quite
dry
since
the
higher
abv
allows
this
brew
to
get
better
with
age
lets
see
what
happens
when
we
keep
this
one
for
a
few
years
to
mature
cloudy

with

the

it

i
will
buy
again
and
give
their

a
try

to
the

presence
of
carbonation
helps
speed
the
warmthwhich
lingers
quite
a
bit
this
is
a
strong
beer
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
aggressive
warmth
good
for
those
chilly
nights
when
you
just
cant
wrap
up
in
enough
blankets
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
i
wanted
to
like
it
and
i
certainly
tried
i
just
cant
get
there
suffice
it
to
say
it
needs
a
lot
of
work
overall
for
a
cheaper
buy
this
is
very
good
a
good
belgian
tripel
interpretation
has
a
hoppy
kick
in
the
finish
but
it
works
well
in
this
one
i
had
this
one
straight
from
the
fridge
to
see
how
it
warms
up
while
drinking
and
it
is
a
good
change
in
the
experience
no
freshness
date
on
it
but
believe
it
would
have
a
decent
shelf
life
i
thought
my
bottle
was
pretty
mellowed
out
and
decently
complex
already
so
it
may
have
been
bottled
a
little
over
a
year
and
a
half
ago
would
love
another
to
age
slightly
sour
and
mildley
sweet
but
bland
from
start
to
finish
for
the
color
that
this
one
poured
i
thought
that
it
had
real
potenshel
but
it
is
just
average
i
dont
hate
thiss
one
but
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
have
anouther
one
eather
altho
the
after
taste
grows
on
you
i
think
this
one
would
be
better
with
age
tastemouthfeel
good
god
this
is
cloyingly
sweet
sugary
as
hell
with
an
almost
excessive
spiciness
clove
nutmeg
and
coriander
with
a
refined
white
sugar
sweetness
is
how
id
describe
this
light
bodied
slightly
overcarbonated
and
horribly
sweet
if
you
enjoy
eating
sugar
packets
you
may
enjoy
this
personally
i
think
ill
grab
something
drier
smooth
slightly
sweet
and
tart
on
the
tongue
hints
of
citrus
very
nice
lightly
malted
yeasty
esters
at
the
close
carbonation

this
fairly
light
for
a
10
abv
alcohol
is
well
hidden
although
it
begins
to
show
its
heat
at
the
end
this
is
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
full
although
drinking
more
then
2
would
begin
to
diminish
flavor
returns
very
tasty
the
beer
pours
a
nice
light
amber
with
a
good
head
thats
whiteisn
with
amber
highlights
the
aroma
is
a
burst
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
big
sweet
malt
then
gives
you
some
banana
caramel
and
vanilla
finally
it
closes
with
a
cleansing
burst
of
hops
the
feel
is
medium
with
a
slight
oilieness
this
one
really
caught
me
off
guard
rh
normally
is
a
little
higher
on
hops
than
i
enjoy
but
here
they
used
more
hops
than
you
usually
see
in
a
trippel
but
the
really
hit
the
mark
with
it
this
is
one
that
i
will
be
buying
more
of

not
so
awesome
d
drinkability
is
about
average
most
characteristics
of
this
beer
are
bland
but
it
somehow
still
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
remotely
interested
at
10
it
goes
down
easy
unfortunately
this
is
just
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
tripel
a
disappointment
good
beer
not
a
top
triple
but
a
good
beer
to
have
from
time
to
time
river
horse
should
be
proud
of
triple
horse
when
poured
into
a
snifter
the
river
horse
brew
is
a
bright
golden
orange
with
a
head
of
white
foam
that
was
about
12
inch
in
height
the
retention
was
ok
but
it
did
manage
to
leave
behind
a
small
island
of
white
bubbles
foamy
white
rings
and
a
spot
or
two
of
lace
the
aroma
was
mild
with
citrus
fruits
citrus
hops
cloves
and
fruity
esters
if
its
swirled
around
a
nice
sized
aroma
of
ripe
banana
will
emerge
from
the
background
the
taste
strated
off
with
citrus
fruits
and
fruity
esters
after
the
esters
have
passed
in
comes
banana
cloves
citrus
hops
and
alcohol
infused
with
citrus
flavoring
it
was
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
faint
aftertaste
of
yeast
cloves
and
citrus
hops
it
however
mask
its
high
10
abv
not
the
best
belgian
triple
but
it
is
a
decent
american
one
its
one
of
the
better
river
horse
beers
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
burnt
orangeamber
color
with
a
head
that
is
rather
small
for
a
belgian
the
head
settles
quickly
due
to
the
10
abv
into
a
modest
collar
that
sticks
to
the
glass
i
dont
get
much
of
the
vanilla
esters
in
the
aroma
im
reminded
more
of
a
the
aroma
of
peach
jolly
rancher
candy
very
sweet
aroma
decent
carbonation
taste
isn
nowhere
near
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
thank
goodness
slight
hint
of
the
peachyvanilla
aroma
with
a
sharp
dry
spiciness
theres
a
kind
of
peppery
bitterness
on
the
end
and
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
somewhat
sparkly
all
in
all
an
interesting
tripel
not
anywhere
near
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
but
not
something
id
turn
away
from
im
gonna
have
to
age
one
of
these
do
a
comparison
firstever
brew
from
river
horse
a
brewery
located
in
my
home
state
of
nj
nice
lucid
clear
appearance
with
a
decent
frothy
head
that
soon
tapered
off
smell
was
somewhat
nondescript
although
a
sweet
honeyladen
aroma
with
alcohol
esters
was
certainly
noticeable
very
rich
ultrasweet
taste
replete
with
caramel
vanilla
honey
and
candied
sugars
is
present
along
with
a
strong
undeniable
alcohol
presence
with
a
noticeable
10
abv
the
strong
alcohol
content
makes
itself
known
decent
mouthfeel
and
only
average
drinkability
due
to
the
strong
alcohol
presence
which
rides
the
tongue
and
doesnt
let
go
otherwise
candied
sugars
vanilla
and
phenols
are
depicted
certainly
not
the
best
representaion
of
the
style
but
not
the
worst
either
an
above
average
brew
but
certainly
not
above
and
beyond
all
in
all
worth
a
try
i
think
the
bottle
was
2
which
was
generous
of
the
manager
as
they
dont
sell
singles
for
10
being
so
easy
so
delicious
i
think
theyre
just
flat
out
lying
d
d
not
too
drinkable
the
malts
and
the
citrus
taste
and
smell
are
excellent
but
the
alcohol
takes
a
little
bit
from
the
beer
the
burning
sensation
on
the
palette
takes
a
little
bit
from
the
taste
but
still
a
decent
session
beer
i
do
not
think
i
would
be
able
to
handle
too
many
of
these
just
because
of
it
enjoy
someone
suggested
years
ago
that
i
revisit
this
one
and
i
finally
did
i
upped
the
scores
a
bit
but
this
still
isnt
all
that
good
i
was
able
to
discern
some
soft
fruit
notes
but
this
is
just
way
too
sweet
the
finish
was
an
unpleasant
medicinal
artificial
sweetener
with
hints
of
cloves
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
have
improved
this
bottle
was
soft
and
full
bodied
mouthfeel
is
light
yet
creamy
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
but
it
is
fairly
drinkable
this
beer
had
a
grainy
texture
and
was
unique
to
the
style
but
worth
a
try
d
almost
too
drinkable
for
the
abv
easily
could
have
put
a
few
away
without
thinking
twice
this
stuff
is
quiet
potent
but
youd
never
know
it
from
tasting
it
i
could
guzzle
this
if
i
had
to
but
why
let
it
go
to
waste
sip
after
sip
i
just
cant
get
tired
of
it

i
was
expecting
more
based
on
the
other
reviews
its
a
decent
beer
i
was
happy
to
get
something
so
big
from
the

looking
and
theres
lace
as
well
decent
yeasty
spiciness
not
overpowering
and
the
malts
used
in
this
brew
also
come
through
in
the
aroma
resinous
clovelike
scents
with
sweet
doughy
bread
taste
is
also
very
good
for
those
who
like
belgians
but
not
the
overpowering
yeast
some
tripels
possess
this
one
is
for
you
dark
fruits
floral
yeast
and
sweet
caramelized
malts
good
slick
body
mildly
carbonated
and
dry
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
relatively
high
but
almost
undetectable
this
is
a
very
decent
offering
an
american
micro
version
which
manages
to
mix
complex
flavors
well
while
keeping
it
accessible
to
those
who
may
be
afraid
of
strong
belgian
flavors
the
beer
hides
the
high
alcohol
content
fairly
well
unfortunately
there
was
some
harshness
from
alcohol
or
bitterness
that
covers
some
of
the
more
delicate
flavors
in
the
middle
of
the
profile
while
drinkable
for
a
high
o
g
brew
overall
there
are
other
belgians
that
id
rather
enjoy
still
worth
trying
my
only
complaints
are
that
its
not
exactly
authentic
and
has
a
definate
us
vibe
screw
tradition
us
brewers
should
make
beers
with
us
style
but
they
call
it
a
triple
so
they
asked
for
it
cheers
to
river
horse
at
first
glance
this
beer
has
a
regular
orangebrownish
color
to
it
the
smell
has
a
high
aroma
of
yeast
the
taste
is
suprisingly
smooth
and
refreshing
no
aftertaste
and
not
much
carbonation
either
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quit
well
overall
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
watch
out
for
the
abv
itll
sneek
up
on
ya
d
very
drinkable
for
having
such
high
alcohol
content
drinkability
reading
through
these
reviews
it
appears
that
this
beer
has
been
somewhat
inconsistent
in
the
past
as
my
impressions
are
very
different
from
some
other
reviewers
in
any
event
i
think
this
tripel
has
a
lot
going
for
it
but
would
be
improved
dramatically
by
reducing
the
abv
a
couple
of
points
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
almost
chewy
very
good
about
what
i
expected
from
the
style
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
this
is
a
strong
beer
after
all
well
its
no
belgian
but
its
a
decent
american
interpretation
of
a
tripel
it
does
have
a
nice
clove
spiciness
and
enough
sweet
malt
to
keep
it
from
being
a
wreck
the
abv
is
dangerously
hidden
making
it
easy
to
drink
it
comes
in
a
sixpack
for
about
ten
bucks
so
if
you
want
a
notsobad
tripel
in
a
sixpack
it
would
be
worth
it
if
you
are
looking
for
belgiuminamerica
i
dont
know
that
this
one
quite
does
it
its
mediumbodied
and
moderatley
complex
with
a
smokey
dry
yeasty
finish
after
a
fruity
center
its
drinkable
it
doesnt
possess
the
most
personalityas
far
as
tripels
are
concerned
but
its
not
bad
river
horse
tripel
horse
is
neither
a
triple
crown
winner
nor
is
it
destined
for
the
glue
factory
its
just
a
simple
inauthentic
version
from
a
brewery
that
im
beginning
to
think
of
as
no
better
than
average
yeah
i
know
that
a
river
horse
is
actually
a
hippopotamus
but
you
try
coming
up
with
a
decent
play
on
words
that
involves
a
hippo
drinkability
was
easy
enough
except
at
10
its
not
sessionable
one
of
my
first
experiences
with
this
style
a
fun
learning
experience
for
me
its
a
big
beer
that
wants
to
play
big
but
isnt
coordinated
enough
to
be
especially
credible
its
like
shaq
playing
with
two
left
feet
and
shoes
that
are
too
big
assuming
such
shoes
exist
somewhere
the
abv
is
the
most
notable
component
of
the
beer
and
thats
not
exactly
a
ringing
endorsement
i
gave
it
a
shot
and
finished
the
bottle
my
wife
is
welcome
to
the
rest
but
im
not
sure
she
wants
it
either
d
not
bad
at
all
i
am
rather
impressed
by
no
means
is
this
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
if
i
stumble
upon
it
it
has
pretty
drinkable
effect
but
it
is
10
abv
which
is
well
masked
by
the
way
worth
trying
at
least
once
below
average
for
the
style
still
quaffable
chocolate
brown
colour
10
is
a
lot
and
i
was
getting
it
from
the
aroma
through
the
afterhammer
a
bit
of
sweetness
an
ok
chewy
yeast
spice
but
nothing
too
complex
fizzy
carbonation

is
an
interesting

finish
a

alcoholic

would
be

really
im
pretty
impressed
by
this
beer
a
great
interpretation
of
a
classic

bad
i
got
this
as
a
gift
only
had
a

and
gave

have
liked
to

aromas
are
pleasing

a

tame

a

cloying
flavors
of
apple
pear
apricot
banana
honey
yeast
and
some
restrained
spices
comes
through
nicely
finish
is
helped
from
getting
too
sweet
by
the
10
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
hops
taking
into
consideration
how
many
better
tripels
are
available
one
try
is
enough
i
have
recommended
to
others
and
they
agree
this
is
a
great
high
alcohol
beer
pours

colored
rather
cloudy
decent
carbonation
not
much
head
along
with
some

light

a
tripel
and
i
do
not
detect
the
alcohol
in
the
nose
which
is
good
sweet
fruitiness
peaches
and
citrus
not
raisins
and
light
malts
taste
is
not
alcoholy
another
plus
but
the
actual
flavors
are
not
so
balanced
rather
sickly
sweet
makes
me
a
little
nauseous
actually
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
had
2
others
of
these
months
ago
and
they
tasted
totally
different
it
definitely
got
better
with
age
however
i
think
it
still
needs
time
to
mature
and
balance
out
overall
ok
if
i
had
rated
this
months
ago
i
would
have
been
much
more
disappointed
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
minimal
head
the
initial
nose
out
of
the
bottle
was
of
sour
apples
taste
is
a
nice
medley
of
sour
apples
candied
sugar
with
a
nice
dry
hop
finish
alcohol
was
warming
with
the
first
sip
only
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
nice
and
full
for
the
style
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
hign
abv
is
well
masked
not
a
bad
job
of
brewing
it
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
but
just
not
quite
up
there
with
the
tripels
from
belgium
but
it
is
worth
a
shot
d
high
drinkability
a
nice
tripel
needs
slightly
less
sour
and
sweet
for
me
but
damn
tasty
dvery
good
i
would
love
another
but
could
have
two
more
the
10
abv
is
sneaky
in
this
one
not
a
tripel
for
everyone
but
for
those
that
like
sweeter
examples
of
the
style
this
should
fit
the
bill
i
enjoyed
this
one
is
it
an
americanized
verion
of
a
tripel
sure
but
its
a
pretty
good
version
nonetheless
d
one
of
the
few
tripels
that
ive
had
but
my
favorite
a
local
beer
to
where
i
grew
up
and
one
that
i
first
had
at
my
uncles
house
which
is
10
minutes
from
the
brewery
a
good
choice
for
a
belgian
style
notes
this
is
my
final
beer
drank
and
reviewed
as
a
single
man
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thinner
side
with
plenty
of
fast
moving
bubbles
goes
down
easy
enough
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
for
10
an
interesting
tripel
that
i
was
happy
to
be
able
to
try
luckily
it
was
not
overly
sweet
id
imagine
id
have
this
again
given
the
opportunity
taste
is
a
bit
too
fruity
sugary
just
toooo
sweet
id
rather
it
be
a
bit
more
subtle
mouthfeel
isnt
very
fullbodied
at
all
and
though
its
a
bit
chewy
its
rather
thin
drinkability
is
relatively
high
considering
alcohol
content
but
this
is
too
sweet
for
me
the
beer
is
fairly
thick
up
front
but
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
from
the
fullness
or
aroma
this
is
a
good
thing
but
surprisingly
this
beer
seems
to
be
missing
a
complexity
that
is
found
in
good
examples
of
the
style
this
beer
has
a
fruitiness
in
the
taste
that
is
similar
to
the
aromas
found
in
the
aroma
i
get
notes
of
pear
and
apple
the
spicy
notes
while
quite
a
bit
more
subtle
than
i
would
like
are
evident
i
get
spicy
notes
of
black
pepper
a
hint
of
ginger
and
perhaps
some
notes
of
lemon
zest
it
does
hide
the
alcohol
quite
well
though
in
the
end
this
beer
is
just
a
bit
lacking
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
so
many
really
good
tripels
out
there
that
i
would
rather
have
my
friend
ray
brought
this
bottle
over
for
a
party
at
the
house
last
year
but
i
just
cut
into
it
tonight
what
a
treat
i
poured
the
beer
into
s
standard
tap
pint
what
a
steal
the
beer
poured
a
sweet
browngolden
color
and
clear
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
of
some
belgian
candied
sugar
and
some
toasted
malts
but
very
approachable
the
taste
is
a
bit
deceptive
or
should
i
say
very
deceptive
at
10
but
is
it
sweet
and
had
a
pleasnt
malty
taste
that
hides
the
high
abv
which
i
like
i
like
alot
i
find
this
beer
to
have
a
medium
body
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
boy
that
is
nice
since
rh
has
another
fine
beer
on
their
hands
i
will
probably
crack
into
a
frostbite
right
now
in
an
attempt
to
create
a
standout
tripel
it
becomes
a
little
overkilled
begins
with
every
fruit
and
spice
imaginable
in
a
beer
among
which
are
pears
pineapples
oranges
pepper
and
corriander
the
malt
and
sugar
base
becomes
over
attenuated
and
the
yeast
exhibits
a
stressed
plastic
and
fusal
unnecessarily
hot
flavor
and
feel
the
candy
sugars
add
a
powdered
sugar
taste
and
powdery
texture
if
youre
interested
in
a
pure
alcohol
beer
and
are
not
fussy
about
flavor
then
this
one
is
probably
for
you
if
not
then
there
are
much
better
belgian
tripels
out
there
cheers
thanks
goes
to
weeare138
for
this
from
the
bottle
poured
goldem
honey
with
a
small
white
head
that
left
a
very
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
sour
with
a
big
kick
of
alcohol
followed
by
pine
grassy
than
get
a
whiff
of
something
sweet
could
it
be
the
vanilla
i
couldnt
tell
flavor
a
light
lemon
yeast
a
slight
sourness
and
alcohol
enjoyed
this
one
d
this
is
not
in
the
same
class
as
some
of
the
world
class
belgian
triples
but
it
is
a
solid
example
none
the
less
nice
job
by
a
small
brewery
recommend
anyone
that
comes
across
this
to
give
it
a
try
a
rather
nice
triple
sort
of
an
americanized
version
with
the
larger
hop
taste
but
beyond
that
just
bigger
and
surprisingly
true
to
style
good
beer
d
overall
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
by
no
means
my
favorite
of
the
syle
ill
definitely
buy
more
bottles
and
hope
to
try
it
on
tap
golden
ginger
in
color
river
horse
tripel
pours
rather
uneventfully
with
a
frothy
ring
around
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
with
tidal
ripples
of
froth
on
the
surface
and
having
that
understated
and
somewhat
unwilling
ameribelge
nose
of
sweet
cotton
candy
it
took
me
a
while
to
pin
down
the
comparable
taste
and
nose
of
this
beer
but
i
would
liken
it
to
a
scented
chewing
gum
called
c
howards
the
body
of
this
beer
is
light
with
not
much
dimension
but
easygoing
and
nonthreatening
i
guess
one
could
totally
ax
this
brew
for
its
infantile
and
less
than
tripel
characteristics
but
this
beer
drinks
quite
well
with
the
alleged
10
abv
well
repressed
within
this
beer
lacks
the
level
of
carbonation
that
would
provide
a
better
tasting
experience
as
such
a
light
version
of
the
style
is
way
to
still
to
create
true
quaffing
excitement
although
the
brewmaster
suggests
cellaring
some
of
this
stuff
for
the
future
this
beer
needs
to
be
consumed
young
as
any
extended
bottle
aging
will
result
in
disappointment
this
tripel
simply
doesnt
have
the
gonads
for
cellaring
drink
it
now
then
move
on
poured
a
soft
amber
color
that
was
easily
penetrated
by
surrounding
light
only
a
slight
head
develops
but
some
light
lacing
is
left
behind
aromas
of
belgian
candy
honey
grains
and
earthyleafy
material
the
taste
is
sweeter
and
much
drier
than
might
be
expected
with
flavors
of
honey
and
fruit
coming
out
very
very
smooth
and
dry
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
cloying
at
first
and
even
a
bit
astringent
but
that
quickly
changes
to
a
sweet
lingering
taste
that
demands
another
sip
to
quench
tastes
very
much
like
a
mild
sparkling
wine
i
couldnt
believe
the
abv
was
10
it
could
easily
have
been
half
that
without
a
difference
in
taste
thats
how
well
it
is
masked
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
would
think
of
it
as
more
of
a
honey
winebeer
than
anything
else
overall
i
recommend
this
beer
though
i
wouldnt
have
if
you
asked
me
when
it
was
fresher
at
10
abv
it
can
probably
sit
for
a
while
now
i
wish
i
bought
a
few
more
this
past
summer
so
i
could
try
again
after
12
and
then
18
months
10
29
6pack
no
go
i
was
fooled
by
the
light
color
i
am
still
learning
and
really
happy
with
the
flavor
the
10
abv
doesnt
come
thru
in
the
very
smooth
taste
i
tried
it
twice
from
the
same
tap
the
first
was
fairly
cold
and
the
2nd
at
a
warmer
temperature
both
were
good
overall
a
bland
looking
beer
that
is
quite
tasty
it
says
10
on
the
bottle
and
i
cant
taste
a
hint
of
alcohol
excellent
job
hiding
it
a
very
good
tripel
good
thing
i
live
close
to
lambertville
drinkability
quite
drinkable
not
a
classic
tripel
but
very
enjoyable
wish
i
had
another
one
but
alas
this
was
my
only
one
fiery
orange
gold
absolutely
beautiful
color
good
clarity
with
a
short
white
head
holds
a
collar
throughout
sweetened
fruity
malt
aroma
candi
sugar
mild
floral
hops
pineapple
and
caramel
apple
opens
with
a
blast
of
sugar
enveloping
the
palate
with
a
slick
greasy
sweetness
heaps
of
fruit
baked
caramelized
apple
pineapple
chunks
melon
and
honey
into
the
finish
plenty
of
phenols
to
match
manifesting
themselves
as
a
plastic
overtone
spicy
floral
hops
blend
nicely
with
the
spicy
peppery
yeast
a
light
wash
of
alcohol
boosts
the
sweetness
some
finishing
just
shy
of
cloying
great
carbonation
spritzy
yet
just
enough
to
carry
through
the
rather
haevy
body
leaves
my
tongue
fairly
dry
surprisingly
overly
sweet
perhaps
balanced
with
the
spicy
finish
and
phenols
drinking
a
bottle
takes
me
some
time
mainly
because
the
sugar
gets
a
little
overbearing
still
very
nicely
done
especially
for
a
brewery

12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
vintage
cellar
radford
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
38
offwhite
head
above
the
clear
light
amber
brew
head
quickly
fades
to
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
with
reasonable
lacing
both
of
which
seem
to
be
more
or
less
to
style
aroma
is
malt
sweetness
and
alcohol
with
some
spicing
reminiscent
of
belgians
taste
resembles
the
nose
spicy
sweetness
covering
fruity
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
could
use
some
more
carbonation
to
smooth
it
out
and
drinkability
gets
cloying
with
the
sugar
bent
of
this
one
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
clear
golden
orange
with
light
white
head
that
shrinks
into
the
body
quickly
with
no
signs
of
lace
very
sweet
aroma
some
fruity
scents
including
apple
very
little
spice
and
fairly
big
alcohol
notes
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
big
sweetness
making
up
most
of
the
flavor
some
light
fruit
and
spice
is
lurking
about
the
alcohol
stands
out
a
bit
too
much
sweet
and
with
an
alcohol
bite
is
how
this
finished
pretty
solid
mouthfeel
what
you
would
expect
fairly
warming
as
well
due
to
the
big
alcohol
not
bad
just
not
interesting
to
me
it
really
didnt
have
enough
of
everything
but
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
notes
this
one
must
not
be
served
too
cold
this
brew
is
a
tawny
amber
color
its
quite
clear
and
has
a
wispy
white
head
seems
a
little
undercarbonated
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
something
alcohol
and
spice
strong
vanilla
peppermint
and
sugar
bananas
grain
roasted
malt
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
that
smell
the
taste
is
full
and
sweetits
pepperyspicy
and
has
a
slight
alcohol
warming
sensation
its
certainly
mouthfilling
and
very
relaxing
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
great
but
not
quite
up
to
the
fantastic
aroma
some
of
those
initial
complexities
get
left
behind
finish
has
a
restrained
bitterness
and
a
lot
of
peppery
spice
solid
and
enjoyable
brew
finally
the
high
alcohol
content
means
lowered
drinkabliity
i
liked
it
but
man
was
it
powerful
sampled
a
12
ouncer
no
freshness
indication
provided
on
the
label
pours
an
orangy
shade
of
copperamber
suprisingly
clear
minimal
yeast
sediment
in
this
one
head
is
light
and
white
and
it
leaves
wispy
and
stringy
lacing
nose
i
picked
up
is
some
light
coriander
like
spicing
and
some
belgian
yeast
esters
this
is
a
fruity
dry
enjoyable
brew
more
like
a
hearty
belgian
pale
ale
to
me
then
a
tripel
but
who
really
cares
what
they
call
it
this
is
a
pleasant
and
worthy
u
s
take
on
the
style
strong
and
flavorful
well
worth
a
try
best
stuff
ive
had
from
rh
unique
honey
amber
color
from
top
to
bottom
because
if
you
are
looking
for
head
look
somewhere
else
this
beer
has
a
definite
fruit
smell
i
am
going
to
say
maybe
apple
peach
and
vanilla
the
taste
says
the
same
fruity
and
sweet
tastes
like
a
good
belgian
attempt
if
you
are
looking
for
a
solid
tripel
without
too
sweet
a
taste
look
no
further
hmmmm
this
is
a
nice
surprise
pours
a
rich
amber
in
color
perfectly
clear
no
head
though
no
matter
how
hard
i
tired
aroma
is
a
bit
fruity
peaches
getting
hints
of
yeast
also
flavor
is
really
impressive
malts
come
through
at
first
very
quickly
followed
by
some
very
sweet
belgian
sugars
yeast
flavors
also
i
had
to
look
into
the
bottle
to
see
if
it
was
bottle
conditioned
also
picking
up
some
apples
coming
through
in
the
yeast
very
smooth
drinking
with
this
great
interpretation
of
the
style
the
only
down
side
is
the
alcohol
it
comes
through
a
bit
too
much
but
at
10
that
is
not
a
surprise
gotta
love
those
phenols
one
of
the
better
american
stabs
at
the
belgian
tripel
style
very
pleasantly
drinkable
wish
i
had
bought
more
as
a
good
tripel
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
though
make
sure
its
not
too
cold
i
went
with
45
degrees
the
first
beer
i
had
and
it
was
way
too
cold
im
up
to
50
today
and
its
fabulous
youll
lose
out
if
its
too
cold
im
going
to
hold
onto
the
last
few
i
have
and
save
them
for
a
rainy
day
pours
a
somewhat
golden
colora
bit
darker
then
most
tripels
no
real
head
low
aromasomewhat
yeasty
and
sweet
malty
flavor
upfront
a
very
slight
phenolic
flavor
some
hop
bitterness
still
sweeter
then
what
i
think
a
tripel
should
be
has
some
good
body
to
it
overall
a
nice
beer
very
much
a
us
version
of
a
triplemuch
more
then
victorys
golden
monkey
which
is
far
more
complex
i
do
have
to
say
this
is
the
first
beer
from
river
horse
that
i
can
honestly
say
was
worth
trying
get
one
or
six
or
a
case
not
a
bad
interpretation
i
would
buy
it
again
for
being
10
avb
this
is
extremely
drinkable
pretty

by

starts
out
with
a
few
tropical
fruits
mixed
with
some
spices
sugar
and
vanilla
also
stand
out
in
the
aroma
department
taste
wasnt
bad
i
thought
the
fruitycitrus
flavors
really
show
their
strength
and
make
it
stand
out
along
with
some
spiciness
which
is
weaker
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
considering
it
was
strong
in
the
nose
the
aftertaste
was
all
vanilla
which
seemed
to
last
forever
moutthfeel
was
full
bodied
with
a
lack
of
carbonation
it
was
quite
drinkable
though
not
really
a
true
tripel
but
it
seemed
they
wanted
to
have
fun
with
this
one
and
kinda
worked
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
thanks
to

finishes
too

not

a

dry

its
kind

in
that
sense
finishes
bittersweet
and
dries
the

completely

almost
immediately
the
abv

noticeable
at

feels
thick
and
full
with
a
little
spritz
in
there
slick
on
the
tongue
an
interesting
tripel
but
a
little
too
alcoholic
and
lacking
in
complexity
for
the
genre
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
balanced
aroma
that
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
along
with
a
dominating
belgian
yeast
finish
it
is
fruity
and
quite
refreshing
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
fruity
and
slightly
tart
it
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
tripels
ive
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
excellent

brew
it
has
a
refreshing
aroma
and
a
smooth

a
good

mouthfeel
is
syrupy

the
malty
thickness
rides
the
tongue
long
after
swallowing
drinakbility
is
a
bit
down
from
a
good
level
since
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
single
beer
session
but
several
may
wear
on
you
with
the
high
and
well
hidden
alcohol
level
worth
seeking
out
thanks
to
jcalbi
for
the
sample
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
at
10
i
would
like
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
for
cellaring
a
good
offering
from
river

highly
recommended
version
of
the
style

remains
near
the

my
list
of
favorite
beers

available
at
this

ontap
only
o
looks
and
smeel
of
this

are
only
slightly
above

for
the
style
low
head
retention
is
a
slight
problem
but
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
help
to
keep
it
up
there
overall
the
balance
is
good
mouthfeel
is
rich

a

a
must
have
for

nearly
perfect
medium

with

a
classic
belgian
ale
leaning
more
towards
a
dubbel
than
a
tripel
but
just
what
it
claims
to
be
a
belgian
blond
ale
after
a
week
of
some
pretty
big
ales
its
nice
to
return
to
something
a
bit
reserved
but
beautifully
balanced
and
flavorful
an
excellent
trappist
ale
deserving
its
reputation
ok
but
not
exceptional
looks
nice
and
the
aroma
is
a
lovely
blend
of
fruity
spicy
hints
rounded
off
with
booze
however
the
flavour
lacks
the
complexity
and
balance
of
the
aroma
harsh
bitterness
is
a
dominant
feature
body
is
alright
but
feels
a
shade
too
spritzy
perhaps
this
bottle
is
just
a
bit
too
old
i
may
rereview
in
the
future
drinkable
enough
but
no
need
to
run
out
and
hunt
it
down
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
ale
well
put
together
o
a
great
springtime
beer
highly
carbonated
exploding
with
fruits

yeast
whats
not
to
like
d
a
decent
brew
would
have
trouble
drinking
a

of
it

was
much
too
effervescent
for
me
overall
definitely
a
solid
nofrills

cant
quite
hang
with
some
of
the
best
of
its
kind
but
a
fine
example

essa
cerveja
é
realmente
surpreendente
antes

eu
havia
lido
sobre

em
vários
lugares
os
quais
não

elogios
a
ela
porém
na

já
senti
que
não
concordava
com
a
opinião
da

eu
tive

exhibits
some
awesome
traits
of
the
style
but
without
underlying
complexity
only
to
show
shallow
yeast
characteristics
of
coriander
spice
and
clay
with
sugary
sweetness
taking
over
most
of
the
profile
its
carbonation
level
aids
in
the
drinkability
of
such
a
sweet
beer
but
its
also
the
cause
of
the
beer
exploding
all
over
the
place
and
its
not
the
first
time
its
happened
to
me
be
cautious
opening
the
bottle
and
dont
expect
a
smackintheface
belgian
tripel
from
this
one
o
very
tasty
the
delicate
feel
of
this
makes
it
really
enjoyable
and
really
showcases
its
sweet

for

which
is
certainly
what
this
beer
is
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
quite
on
style
for
a
tripel
yet
again
overall
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
i
recommend
getting
a
bottle
and
giving
it
a
try
its
got
an
excellent
and
complex
aroma
and
a
nice
taste
that
melds
with
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
its
not
the
best
trappist
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
frothy
white

that
keeps
on
going
aroma
screams

a
sweet

taste
is

dry
yeasty
finish
this
one
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
i
enjoyed
it
could
drink
it
in
any
occasion
while
this
was
a
nice
beer
the
premium
price
that
comes
from
the
trappist
label
puts
this
out
of
reach
as
a
regular
brew
solid
beer
though
o
great
aroma
complex
and
very
well
integrated
the
aromas
go
very
well
together
the
flavor
though
is
not
great
tangy
a
bit
too
dry
without
all
the
complexities
of
the
aroma
pairs
well
with
margarita
pizza
traditional
caesar
salad
and
alfredo
pasta
atmosphere
is
really
good
hazy
and
golden
with
a
substantial
head
and
lots
of
thick
lacing
nose
is
yeasty
and
hearty
grainy
flavor
very
yeasty
accentuated
with
a
citrus

overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
o
achel
8
is
a
trappist
trippel
of
high
class
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
nearly
clear
gold
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
remains
dense
throughout
the
session
excellent
balance
between
fruity
esters
hop
spice
and
a
slightly
rustic

crisp
malt
faint
banana
coriander
nutmeg
pear
black
pepper
with
a
slightly
chalky
bitterness
dry
and
airy
in
the
mouth
goes
down
way
too
easy
an
excellent
trappist
ale
overall
this
is
a
good
tripel
not
great
but
good
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
5
per
12oz
price
tag
but
if
you
have
the
extra
cash
go
for
it
o
a
disappointment
for
a
trappist
tripel
and
the
resounding
loser
to
chimay
white
which
i
scored
4

the
unappealing
plasticky
sweetness
is
the
memorable
feature
and
thats
a
drag
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sluggish
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
not
bad
for
the
style
overall
a
bit
of
a
sweet
mess
i
wouldnt
know
what
to
do
with
another
bottle
of
this
the
kind
of
thing
that
that
gives
tripels
a
bad
name
330
ml
brown
bottle
at
home
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
i
have
this
bottle
for
almost
one
year
in
my
cellar
abv

slighty
hazy
deep
orange
colour
on
top
two
fingers
of
snow
white
sopay
head
very
good
retention
leaves
light
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
was
all
malts
when
i
opened
the
bottle
now
that
it
sits
in
the
glass
aroma
is
fruity
a
bit
yeasty
some
notes
of
the
alcohol
too
very
nice
flavour
very
complex
as
well
quite
bitter
even
from
the
beginning
again
lots
of
fruity
notes
a
bit
of
malts
aftertaste
is
sharply
bitter
alcohol
very
well
hidden
great
full
body
a
biting
carbonation
but
only
for
a
second
quite
dry
on
the
palate
overall
a
very
good
belgian
strong
ale
the
amount
of
bitterness
surprised
me
on
this
one
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
in
spite
of
the
high
abv
overall
quite
complex
and
very
well
balanced
a
lot
of
blondes
tend
to
be
very
big
on
one
note
this
one
balances
a
lot
of
the
common
blonce
notes
very
well
so
its
a
real
winner
in
the
style
for
me
o
im
glad
i
didnt
let
this
beer
get
too
much
age
on
it
it
will
be
an
interesting
experiment
to
see
how
it
tastes
with
a
few
months
on
it
but
im
pretty
sure
what
makes
it
good
will
start
to
fade
this
was
a
great
blonde
and
ill
definitely
seek
it
out
again
achel
blond
is
a
fine
tripel
middle
of
the
road
by
belgian
standards
which
is
no
laughing
matter
but
i
wonder
if
it
werent
brewed
by
monks
would
it
retain
its
prestige
in
this
year
2013
i
found
this
beer
on
the
shelf
labeled
sept
2009
i
was
sick
at
the
time
so
waited
til
i
could
properly
taste
to
open
immediately
upon
opening
the
bottle
it
made
a
slight
hiss
then
filled
the
air
with
the
scent
of
apples
the
smell
changed
slightly
in
the
pour
openingup
notes
of
caramel
toffee
honey
smells
as
if
its
going
to
have
a
very
big
thick
flavor
taste
starts
with
a
light
bread
flavor
then
tastes
like
theres
mixed
fruit
jam
on
th
bread
apple
raisin
plum
peach
with
sweet
toffee
candy
on
the
end
of
the
taste
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
with
sugars
and
candy
lingering
the
toffee
caramel
and
sugar
influence
is
heightened
actually
when
the
sediment
is
poured
its
an
amber
orangebrown
color
with
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
towards
a
thick
head
that
starts
3
fingers
and
lowers
while
sipping
but
never
goes
away
more
toffee
and
sugar
flavor
in
the
head
more
bread
and
fruit
jam
taste
in
the
liquid
an
excellent
drink
though
i
hear
some
people
prefer
a
young
bottle
o
this
somewhat
warped
that
my
first
experience
is
a
3
yr
bottle
but
ill
remember
this
beer
and
come
back
to
this
review
to
compare
a
younger
bottle
low
c
d
ill
give
it
another
chance
sometime
a
trappist
with
higher
drinkability
than
average
refreshing
and
still
packed
with
flavors
and
spices
to
a
moderate
level
which
is
good
for
a
change
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
but
with
a
powerful
pepper
character
and
a
moderate
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
long
while
it
has
the
kind
characteristics
i
like
in
a
trappist
ale
but
it
has
a
bit
more
bite
to
it
than
others
oi
found
this
to
be
an
aboveaverage
beer
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
my
favorite
tripels
karmeliet
fin
du
monde
or
tank
7
for
example
the
flavors
are
solid
but
not
as
wellintegrated
as
the
leading
beers
of
this
style
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lacking
my
criticisms
however
are
all
relative
and
i
would
readily
drink
this
beer
again
strong
malty
aroma
has
a
fruity
overtone
that
is
crisp
and
ciderlike
rather
than
sweet
pours
a
bubbly
clear
solar
yellow
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
crisp
malty
flavor
has
a
firm
fruity
note
mostly
apple
with
a
hint
of
pear
and
a
hoppy
green
wood
undertone
just
a
little
bitterness
smooth
flavor
has
good
body
and
plenty
of
tingle
you
go
monks
a
great
tripel
and
while
i
wouldnt
rate
it
higher
than
westmalles
its
still
one
that
i
enjoyably
return
to
again
i
love
the
fruitiness
but
the
excessive
sugary
taste
over
a
more
bitter
option
might
make
it
considerably
less
enjoyable
over
time
still
a
good
starter
for
people
wanting
to
try
nice
belgian
beers
will
pour
a
five
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
cloudy
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
apple
and
belgian

nose
and
flavor
is

very
crisp

clean
without

this
turns
into
a
bigger
more
balanced
beer
different
experience
for
sure
and
both
are
interesting
though
id
add
the
yeast
from
the
start
next
time
cant
beat
that
aroma
and
more
balanced
mouthfeel
with
the
yeast
while
this
is
a
great
tripel
its
overpriced
considering
st

is
a
couple
dollars
cheaper
and
tastes
better

really
enjoyed
this
one
i
also
had
a

that
was
3
years
older
recently
and
this
fresher
bottle
was
far
superior
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
was
left
wanting
for
more
flavor
the
aroma
promises
so
much
but
the
taste
is
an
odd
combo
of
dry
cracker
and
sweet
malt
after
a
while
though
if
youre
not
overanalyzing
it
it
starts
to
go
down
real
smooth
and
refreshing
it
masks
the
8
abv
very
well
but
the
copper
penny
taste
drags
it
down
a
notch
pale
clear
gold
with
a
pearly
white
head
sticky
lacing
and
its
all
around
attractive
pretty
clear
for
a

nose
is
nice
usual
suspects
like
green
apple
and
that

smell
that
reminds
you
of

taste
takes

in
that
its
sort
of
herbal
and
bitter
in
addition
to
the
typical
fruity
chalky
tripeley

is
a

d
other
than
the
blatant

this
is
an
all
around
solid
drinkable
tripel
as
a
side
note
im
beginning
to
think
lacing
is
really
dependant
on
the
glassware
used
i
typically
use
a
tulip
or
balloon
shaped
goblet
for
beer
like
this
and
dont
usually
see
a
ton
of
lacing
but
this
glass
which
has
sides
that
are
more
vertical
seems
to
allow
for
much
more
lacing
to
occur
anyways
a
solid
beer
save
for
the
one
carbonation
flaw
this
is
the
dryest
of
the
tripels
that
i
have
been
tasting
and
has
an
almost
farmhouse
saison
quality
to
it
very
simple
and
easy
drinking
with
an
enticing
spicy
character
pilsner
malt
really
shines
through
and
it
is
not
very
hoppy
or
bitter
i
nice
stripped
down
no
nonsense
tripel
and
an
excellent
intro
to
this
style
for
anyone
whos
never
had
it
original
review
10102010
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
complexity
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
but
this
is
much
more
of
a
sipping
beer
than
a
session
beer
for
a
tripel
this
was
a
bit
weak
lacking
the
salty
seaweedy
lightly
hammy
flavor
and
the
scabby
blotchy
head
that
i
find
so
oddly
appealing
for
a
nice
blond
ale
however
this
was
pretty
good
its
somewhat
light
in
all
categories
including
the
abv
is
this
really
8
but
still
has
plenty
of
yeasty
belgiancomfy
taste
i
wouldnt
become
a
monk
over
this
one
but
id
at
least
visit
a
beer
store
on
the
monks
behalf
d
very
drinkable
o
overall
this
is
well
worth
the
tag
of
a
trappist
beer
i
had
my
reservations
on
purchasing
this
one
given
its
high
price
tag
but
wow
my
doubts
were
mislead
an
absolute
must
for
any
lover
of
blondes
tripels
or
trappist
ales
o
a
good
tripel
overall
id
like
a
bit
more
depth
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
along
with
a
lighter
and
crisper
body
but
still
its
quite
tasty
this
is
a
nice
treat
a
beer
that
always
seems
to
command
a
high
price
tag
and
is
not
as
easily
available
as
other
better
options
still
a
prize
tripel
thats
easy
to
enjoy
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
like
to
have
to
wait
for
its
goodness
through
a
giant
head
pretty
good
though
actually
quite
good
indeed
ill
want
another
from
this
brewery
for
sure
pours
a
medium
gold
color
with
an
enormous
4
finger
eggshell
head
even
with
a
careful
pour
the
beer
is
murky
and
impossible
to
see
through
and
the
head
leaves
massive
lacing
on
my
tulip
glass
the
nose
is
actually
very
average
for
a
tripel
a
little
fruit
a
little
spice
a
little
malt
and
all
of
them
are
on
the
weak
side
it
just
doesnt
have
that
amazing
aroma
and
complexity
the
best
in
style
have
fortunately
the
taste
is
way
better
i
get
fruit
caramel
sugar
spices
and
burned
toast
in
the
taste
much
better
than
the
nose
feel
is
medium
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
very
chewy
feel
to
the
beer
none
of
the
8
abv
is
felt
or
tasted
overall
a
good
brew
but
the
nose
really
brings
this
one
down
cheers
a
nice
enough
tripel
but
the
competition
is
stiff
in
this
style
so
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
very
curious
to
what
a
fresh
bottle
tastes
like
but
im
loving
this
as
its
bb
date
approaches
mellow
and
sweet
this
is
something
i
could
drink
again
overall
a
classic
already
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
absolutely
amazing
id
prefer
a
westmalle
tripel
but
this
is
certainly
a
good
substitute
a
must
try
if
you
dig
belgian
blondestripels
d
may
be
a
fullish
body
but
this
brew
is
so
easy
drinking
it
doesnt
matter
i
could
have
one
of
these
at
any
time
of
the
day
belgian
tripels
have
a
great
way
of
being
full
bodied
without
the
heat
overall
pleasantly
surprised
the
best
ive
ever
had
will
be
buying
again
o
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
glad
i
tried
it
not
my
best
tasting
which
may
have
effected
my
review
p
s
their
brune
is
just
as
awesome
o
a
very
good
blond
i
mean
triple
really
i
didnt
know
until
i
saw
it
at
ba
i
would
say
to
serve
this
beer
at
a
bit
below
cellar
temp
not
too
warm
because
it
is
very
carbonated
a
fantastic
beer
i
will
scoop
up
a
few
anytime
i
run
across
them
dry
finish
crisp
palate
o
looking
for
an
allday
trappist
heres
my
pick
i
love
how
nonthreatening
this
beer
is
i
mean
you
cant
drink
a
rochefort
without
feeling
a
bit
of
shellshock
from
the
flavors
in
the
end
achel
blond
is
a
testament
to
the
drinkability
and
sheer
pleasure
that
we
can
get
from
wellbalanced
flavor
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
would
pick
to
accompany
a
meal
at
many
different
occasions
or
to
serve
to
a
group
of
people
who
arent
necessarily
beer
connoisseurs
its
just
one
of
those
crowdpleasing
brews
o
3
i
have
finally
put
to
rest
my
long
standing
question
as
to
whether
blond
ales
age
well
though
this
beer
certainly
wasnt
undrinkable
and
was
even
moderately
enjoyable
due
to
the
extreme
radical
change
in
character
i
would
argue
that
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
fresh
and
shouldnt
be
aged
oan
excellent
contrast
to
the
other
more
lush
rich
tripels
would
love
to
try
one
with
a
few
years
on
it
to
see
if
it
mellows
overall
i
love
this
beer
and
on
my
ongoing
journey
to
try
all
the
trappist
ales
this
is
another
impressive
and
exciting
offering
its
rich
and
fruity
a
damn
good
brew
pours
bright
orange
gold
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
thick
bonewhite
head
nose
has
classic
bpa
notes
with
some
fruitiness
and
dough
from
the
yeast
and
a
little
citrus
from
the
hops
palate
is
crisp
and
dry
with
some
nice
bittering
hops
hay
and
orange
pulp
come
to
mind
for
flavors
my
favorite
of
the
achel
line
but
still
prefer
la
trappe
triple
or
westmalle
triple
duvel
glass
pour
and
i
am
met
with
foam
plus
a
little
beer
at
the
bottom
huge
foamy
head
that
looks
like
a
french
vanilla
float
had
to
try
three
times
to
get
all
the
beer
into
the
glass
at
once
underneath
all
that
foam
is
a
cloudy
amber
colored
ale
the
aroma
is
grassy
lemon
smell
with
some
apple
and
other
fruits
some
minor
malt
as
well
great
tasting
with
some
spicy
pepper
like
qualities
up
front
followed
by
a
yeastgrainy
feel
and
some
very
light
fruit
lemon
peel
at
the
end
of
the
sip
slightly
sour
big
carbonation
and
dries
very
quickly
in
the
mouth
overall
i
feel
this
is
a
very
nice
tripel
and
obviously
as
authentic
as
it
can
get
not
as
fruity
or
sweet
as
other
tripels
which
is
a
nice
change
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
a
small
bottle
though
as
it
does
numb
the
tastebuds
after
a
while
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
huge
4
inch
stark
white
head
the
head
overflowed
when
i
poured
the
beer
and
there
are
super
aggressive
carbonation
bubbles
in
this
one
the
head
settles
down
into
a
mountainous
pillow

detracts
from
the
overall
experience
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
good
tripel
from
this
trappist
brewery
and
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
overall
quite
the
treat
one
of
the
most
intense
blonds
ive
ever
tasted
and
probably
one
of
the
tastiest
as
well
wish
it
were
cheaper
but
at
the
same
time
i
wish
they
all
were
o
not
my
favorite
tripel
but
a
very
good
one
definitely
recommend
od
lovely

probably
underrated

no

alot
of
characteristics
i
like
and
theyve
presented
it
flawlessly
balance
is
slanted
towards
an
astringent
unpleasant
bitterness
flavors
are
somewhat
muted
and
thus
slightly
lackluster
some
additional
sweetness
or
a
less
astringent
finish
would
help
this
tripel
incarnation
considerably

a

my
taste

id
expect
along
with
a
little
more

than
im
used
to
in
a
tripel
the
flavor
lingers
a
little
after

overall
a
very
tasty
tripel
an
agreeable
and
equitably
recommendable
tripel
the

honed

reduced
to
a

quite
drinkable
for
that
or
at
least
until
the
flipside
of
the
sword
makes
its
mark
trappist
brewers
do
excel
at
subtly
and
this
one
sneakily
possesses
it
in
spades
aftertaste
of
bitter
hops
slightly
cloying
drinkability
is
good
im
pretty
partial
to
tripels
and
this
one
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
this
is
no
st
bernardous
or
goulden
carolus
this
is
very
mild
and
surprisingly
drinkable
nice
legs
on
this
blond
but
ive
had
better
nice
belgian
blonde
here
clean
up
the
aroma
and
this
would
be
excellent
a
good
tripel
well
balanced
nice
with
strong
cheese
md
this
is
a
pretty
balanced
beer
with
a
more
mild
carbonation
the
beer
itself
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
dry
finish
to
it
a
proper
belgian
tripel
easily
drinkable
limited
only
by
abv
and
price
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
and
smooth
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
tripel
which
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
nice
trappist
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
among
the
trappist
beers
a
delicious
trappist
ale
much
nicer
than
the
bruin
easy
to
drink
but
more
potent
than
expected
great
balance
very
fine
very
much
underrated
here
one
of
the
best
tripels
i
can
remember
achel
does
an
incredible
job
crafting
their
beers
yet
another
solid
offering
in
the
interest
of
science
i
split
the
beer
between
two
glasses
my
duvel
glass
and
my
beautiful
and
new
goose
island
widemouthed
glass
this
glass
accentuates
the
malt
especially
the
doughy
mildly
dusty
character
the
carbonation
is
also
firmer
and
more
scrubbing
the
palate
tastes
sweeter
and
not
as
complex
if
i
were
to
review
that
pour
id
give
it
a
b
instead
of
the
a
its
gotten
here
i
guess
my
duvel
tulip
will
have
to
be
my
goto
reviewing
glass
here
on
out
drinkability
i
prefer
this
one
to
the
2010
while
it
is
not
as
balanced
it
is
overall
a
more
tasty
tripel
d
still
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
certainly
in
much
different
balance
but
i
think
they
are
still
all
excellent
a
nice
addition
to
the
trappist
beers
would
recommend
to
lovers
of
several
kinds
of
drinks
not
only
beer
d
not
my
favourite
tripel
not
my
favourite
achel
still
a
great
beer
a
treat
to
drink
fun
and
rewarding
recommended
jd
good
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
and
contributes
to
the
dry
finish
a
decently
drinkable
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
well
carbonation
is
stupidly
high
just
like
the
bruin
what
is
the
point
of
carbonation
so
high
that
you
cant
taste
the
beer
drinkability
for
one
word
to
describe
this
beer
think
balance
there
is
both
sweet
and
bitter
here
and
their
interplay
leaves
one
wanting
another
sip
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
and
intend
to
revisit
it
when
possible
taste
is
fruit
like
apples
grapes
and
pears
with
a
pretty
good
sized
dose
of
belgian
hops
very
clean
crisp
and
fresh
tasting
nice
mouth
feel
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
triple
indeed
another
trappist
that
got
it
right
although
this
beer
was
within
its
best
buy
date
it
would
be
much
better
fresh
a
good
trippel
but
for
the
price
i
was
expecting
better
pours
a
nice
very
light
orange
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
pretty
large
number
of
lace
rings
nose
brings
forward
some
spice
sweetness
light
fruits
and
a
bit
of
pear
taste
brings
in
a
bit
of
booze
along
with
spice
and
light
grain
good
fairlylight
mouthfeel
with
some
alcohol
heat
drinks
quite
well
although
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
westmalle
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
beer
but
it
seems
like
the
most
amazing
thing
right
now
very
possibly
my
new
favorite
tripel
crisp
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
with
above
average
carbonation
as
for
drinability
id
put
it
at
fair
i
wouldnt
object
to
another
but
for
my
money
there
are
better
tripels
out
there
d
i
like
it
could
have
a
few
d
the
trappists
know
what
theyre
doing
when
it
comes
to
beer
and
the
achel
blond
is
no
exception
perhaps
the
youthfulness
of
the
brewery
is
evident
in
its
agressive
hoppiness
but
thats
fine
by
me
a
must
try
far
too
expensive
for
the
quality
of
the
beer
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
good
tripel
all
in
all
dthis
is
lively
and
carbonated
in
the
throat
with
some
interestingly
balanced
flavors

of

of

the
bottom
of

it
doesnt

interesting

with

touch

at

fruit

there
too
golden

and
peppery

the
first
thing
you
notice
when
tasting
the
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
its
a
contradiction
its
at
once
effervescent
yet
creamy
light
yet
heavy
really
incredible
the
actual
taste
is
a
flavor
explosion
with
just
a
ton
of
different
things
going
on
the
light
sourness
carries
over
to
the
taste
with
some
sour
apple
notes
that
belie
a
sweet
orange
marmalade
finish
in
the
middle
theres
a
really
nice
light
caramel
sweetness
going
on
helping
to
cleverly
mask
the
high
abv
this
is
really
a
very
well
constructed
belgian
blonde
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
had
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
not
complain
at
all
d
for
drinking
slowly
not
a
guzzler
easy
going

achel
8
pours
a
clear
gold
with
the
most
beautiful
fluffy

that
lingers
with
a
thick
whipped

the
aroma
is
sweet
pale
malt
and
some
spicy
yeast
character
sweet

and
estery
malt
is
upfront
in
the
flavor
the
estery
sweetness
fades
leaving
the
finish
dry
and
phenolic
there
is
some
alcohol
but
it
is
fairly
mild
simple
but
delicious
it
seems
that
achel
is
less
hyped
but
equal
to
the
other
trappists
id
never
had
achel
before
but
this
one
wont
be
my
last
this
is
pretty
damned
close
to
being
a
style
standardbearer
like
most
good
tripels
alcohol
is
nowhere
and
the
beer
goes
down
way
too
easily
d
saw
it
at
that
old
gulf
gas
station
with
500
single
bottles
and
grabbed
it
right
away
ive
been
lookin
for
this
for
quite
some
time
all
i
need
to
do
is
find
a
westvleteren
and
ill
have
had
a
beer
from
all
7
trappist
breweries
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
gotta
be
one
of
my
favorite
tripels
ever
and
the
yeast
funkiness
keeps
me
comin
back
for
more
shoulda
got
2
bottles
d
this
is
a
continual
contradiction
that
all
comes
together
as
a
great
beer
it
is
perfectly
balanced
but
still
shows
some
great
individual
elements
it
is
substantial
and
mouth
coating
but
still
dangerously
drinkable
bravo
d
definitely
a
most
drinkable
sessionable
tripel
the
taste
was
well
balanced
with
almost
perfect
smoothness
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
most
enjoyable

tripelblond

the
warmer

tastes
and
drinks
like
a
typical
tripel
which
for
me
is
a
good
thing
d
this
is
a
top
beer
and
deserves
top
marks
you
wont
find
a
poor
beer
from
this
monastary
a
very
good
taste
smooth
and
round
completes
this
wonderfull
and
drinkable
beer
a
beer
which
you
should
have
to
drink
it
is
better
than
the
blond
westvleteren
impression
another
superb
trappist
priced
too
high
for
one
to
enjoy
as
often
as
one
would
want
a
really
do
like
this
beer
but
i
much
prefer
orval
probably
not
one
that
id
get
again
considering
the
closest
place
to
me

carries
it

hour

i
enjoyed
the

and
the
slightly

the

is
extremely
drinkable

rather

d

maybe
but
the

of
that

even
that
i
like

i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beer
and
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
more
often
if
it
was
easier
to
get
and
cheaper
overall
this
was
more
impressive
to
me
than
the
aged

i
had
recently
a
well
done
beer
that
works
nice
with
the
time
of
year
worth
a
shot
pretty
creamy
mouthfeel
that
slides
down
easy
with
very
light
carbonation
but
at
the
same
time
its
got
some
body
to
it
and
some
weight
the
caramel
sweetness
reappears
as
the
beer
sits
and
warms
and
negates
the
metallic
taste
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
thats
fairly
tasty
and
very
smooth
and
drinkable

a

opinion
i
really
like
this
beer
too
it
is
really
clean
and
stupid
easy
to
drink
the
carbonation
is
so
high
that
you
can
barely
tell
how
strong
this
beer
is
i
am
enjoying
the
beer
and
am
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
this
beer
again
d
this
is
an
exceptionally
wellcrafted
beer
it
is
the
definition
of
balance
it
is
fabulous
yet
restrained
making
for
a
subtle
stunner
foam
a
little
sweet
but
that
quickly
becomes
bitter
nose
a
little
alcohol
that
recalls
the
classic
combination
of
orangecilantro
the
taste
is
fairly
simple
and
has
little
flavor
it
is
still
bitter
and
spicy
but
it
remains
unconvincing
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
too
spicy
but
is
actually
quite
interesting
despite
the
appetizing
qualities
of
beer
we
find
ourselves
with
a
beer
relatively
low
in
flavor
and
certainly
it
is
a
beer
style
triple
coupled
with
a
trappist
beer
one
of
the
few
trappists
who
really
disappoints
refreshing
upfront
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
warmth
in
the
end
notes
good
beer
but
not
as
intense
and
flavorful
as
other
trappists
beers
mouthfeel
smooth
medium
body
with
quite
some
carbonation
that
feels
right
d
not
bad
this
beer
is
really
boring
though
i
will
probably
not
revisit
this
one
carbonation
is
never
too
much
or
prickly
pretty
dry
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
and
the
8
doesnt
slow
you
down
at
all
i
remember
really
enjoying
the
achel
blond
a
lot
more
the
first
time
but
this
time
i
am
a
little
disappointed
i
am
a
big
fan
of
all
trappist
beers
but
this
one
is
on
the
lower
end
of
the
scale
i
have
a
couple
of
bottles
of
the
blond
still
left
maybe
i
should
invite
a
friend
over
and
enjoy
the
beer
without
having
to
review
it
d
this
is
a
nice
triple
with
great
yeast
character
especially
in
the
aroma
the
hops
are
put
to
good
use
here
and
manage
to
balance
out
the
relatively
sweet
finish
while
also
augmenting
the
peppery
character
of
the
yeast
in
the
flavor
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
has
obviously
started
to
go
bad
and
dulls
the
flavor
a
bit
not
to
mention
the
unpleasant
looking
floaters
in
an
otherwise
good
looking
beer
overall
is
is
quite
enjoyable
though
i
cant
help
but
think
it
was
a
better
beer
when
it
left
belgium
than
it
is
by
the
time
it
makes
its
way
over
here
overall
not
a
bad
tripel
a
very
fine
representation
of
the
style
i
liked
the
flavor
nothing
special
but
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
very
nice
not
overly
complex
or
satisfying
from
a
flavor
perspective
not
one
of
my
favorite
trappist
beers
a
long
way
off
from
westmalle
the
standard
for
my
money
thick
head
wouldnt
dissipate
yeasty
very
residual
thick
triple
taste
with
mild
carbonation
the
aroma
is
sweet
citrusy
taste
turns
into
dry
hops
very
good
beer
conclusion
far
from
the
best
but
not
the
worst
if
you
are
looking
for
a
belgian
tripel
that
is
wellcrafted
tastes
delicious
and
is
easy
to
drink
look
no
further
whoa
yummy
orrr
perhaps
i
should
say
luxuriant
very
lively
beer
started
foaming
over
over
as
soon
as
the
bottle
was

poured

a
great

bright
orange
amber
until
the
lees
at
the
bottom
was
added
to
cloud
it
up
aroma
is
similar
in
a
way
to
the
bavarian
weiss
with
the
banana
and
clove
but
different
lots
of
malt
yeast
honey
a
little
hop
and
white
wine
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
good
interplay
between
bitter
and
sweet
satsifying
good
for
a
few
sips
and
perhaps
a
couple
of
quaffs
before
returning
to
sipping
great
finish
too
a
little
boozy
at
the
end
head
lasts
forever
a
session
beer
for
the
slow
going
overall
a
good
tripel
and
a
very
wellcrafted
brew
as
you
would
expect
the
finish
has
lingering
subtle
malt
sweetness
from
the
med
body
this
beer
is
ok
but
not
the
best
trappist
by
a
long
shot
overall
good
but
not
great
in
comparison
to
its
brethren
d
very
drinkable
authentic
belgian
triple
authentic
trappist
quality
poured
a
blondgolden
yellow
color
slightly
turbid
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
that
was
constantly
replenished
by
the
high
carbonation
and
left
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
moderate
and
seemed
overly
simple
mainly
corn
rice
and
crystal
malt
flavor
is
simple
yet
elegant
very
clean
corn
and
rice
flavor
upfront
followed
by
angel
food
cake
and
freshly
baked
white
bread
warming
as
well
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
smooth
despite
the
high
carbonation
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
clean
and
refreshing
beer
the
alcohol
is
present
somehow
more
than
youd
expect
ive
had
this
trappist
before
its
modest
in
its
range
of
flavours
and
allthough
its
certainly
well
worth
a
try
its
not
quite
as
significant
as
f
i
rochefort
chimay
or
orval
this
could
well
be
a
favorite
of
many
great
drink
with
a
nice
malt
finish
d
not
as
heavy
as
other
trappistbeers
but
very
nice
in
the
great
dryness
a
bit
more
discrete
than
other
trappisttripels
if
you
see
the
trappiststamp
on
the
label
you
cant
go
wrong
d
a
very
nice
tripel
with
an
excellent
appearance
pretty
solid
across
the
board
get
this
beer
anytime
anywhere
notes
it
is
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
i
waited
until
review
625
to
review
this
trappist
beer
from
achel
but
i
think
that
waiting
that
long
gave
me
a
good
perspective
to
enjoy
this
beer
with
the
proper
perspective
this
is
an
expertly
made
version
of
the
style
bravo
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
enjoyable
all
around
another
great
trappist
and
a
great
tripel
md
thickbodied
for
a
tripel
but
pleasant
i
could
certainly
drink
a
few
of
these
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
drinkability
i
love
a
good
tripel
and
this
is
no
exception
light
despite
a
high
abv
beautiful
malt
character
bringing
interesting
flavors
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
a
decent
overall
tripel
here
good
balance
of
flavors
and
deceptive
given
its
strength
i
can
reccommend
drinking
this
the
taste
is
light
and
the
flavors
still
come
out
nicely
but
there
is
a
slight
harshness
provided
by
the
yeast
strain
while
equal
in
complexity
to
that
of
the
smell
the
taste
is
a
bit
spicier
and
very
drying
tastes
of
horse
blanket
and
astringent
orange
are
also
present
but
not
completely
disturbing
ive
learned
that
you
cant
go
wrong
with
any
trappist
but
some
are
more
drinkable
than
others
still
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
beer
could
get
you
in
trouble
but
i
dont
see
it
as
an
incredibly
easy
drinker
as
in
you
wont
sit
down
drink
4
or
5
and
get
tossed
its
more
of
an
even
draw
drink
thatll
leave
you
satisfied
notes
its
pretty
sweet
for
a
tripel
and
kind
of
sour
as
well
i
imagine
that
would
turn
many
people
away
from
this
beer
but
not
me
i
love
it
its
deliciously
complex
theres
no
way
i
can
figure
out
everything
thats
going
on
in
here
had
this
at
the
tap
house
in
norfolk
poured
into
a
goblet
appears
a
nice
clowdy
golden
color
aromas
of
citrus
fruits
mostly
pineapple
with
some
caramel
the
beer
starts
off
dry
and
spicy
with
carbonation
hitting
in
tbe
middle
with
a
nice
acidic
finish
very
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
another
great
trappist
beer
the
drinks
easy
for
its
strength
good
beer
not
a
great
trappist
d
i
liked
this
beer
and
could
drink
it
all
night
if
i
wanted
not
over
the
top
in
any
bit
of
its
character
d
refreshing
and
crisp
very
drinkable
the
abv
isnt
as
high
as
it
could
be
but
still
could
get
you
into
trouble
cheers
overall
this
is
a
very
good
tripel
pretty
decent
tripel
ther
are
several
i
have
tried
that
are
better
very
dissapointed
compared
to
other
trappist
ales
reminds
me
of
a
strong
american
pale
ale
ok
md
the
palate
benefits
a
lot
from
the
refreshing
yet
also
superfine
carbonation
as
much
as
from
the
chewy
bitter
palate
attributable
to
the
good
proportion
of
hops
in
the
mixture
highlighted
by
the
yeast
intervention
overall
the
texture
is
rounded
and
smooth
turning
bitter
and
heavenly
chewy
while
no
trace
of
alcohol
is
picked
up
whatsoever
while
being
neither
as
colourfully
estery
nor
as
profoundly
malty
as
some
other
tripel
ales
i
like
this
one
for
its
almost
pure
integrity
an
achievement
made
possible
by
people
the
monks
who
really
know
their
stuff
and
proudly
keep
the
long
tradition
to
me
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
example
of
tripel
or
whatever
style
one
wishes
to
label
it
poured
into
a
konigshoeven
glass
in
order
to
keep
with
the
trappist
theme
this
produced
a
very
large
white
head
very
much
like
a
pilsener
the
color
is
a
hazy
yellow
and
its
possible
to
detect
the
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
is
the
first
achel
brew
that
i
have
tried
and
i
was
surprised
that
the
beer
was
so
sour
for
a
belgian
tripel
ale
nevertheless
its
still
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
it
has
not
deterred
me
from
trying
more
achel
products
overall
decent
brew
but
there
are
much
better
beers
of
the
style
out
there
d
damn
this
is
quite
delicious
it
doesnt
fit
my
general
perception
of
a
tripel
but
its
bursting
with
unique
and
complex
flavors
undoubtedly
this
unique
character
is
a
result
of
aging
but
i
would
love
to
get
a
hold
of
this
stuff
fresh
to
compare
d
not
a
bad
drop
the
sharpness
of
taste
may
inhibit
imbibing
too
many
of
these
not
my
favourite
trappist
but
good
nonetheless
overall
not
a
bad
brew
tastewise
but
the
rest
of
it
was
pretty
average
a
bit
too
thin
as
well
that
said
however
its
a
much
better
offering
than
their
double
and
id
go
for
it
again
lots
of
carbonation
to
this
guy
crisp
and
dry
in
the
finish
a
great
beer
from
the
lesser
known
of
the
trappist
breweries
for
me
this
beer
falls
just
behind
chimay
white
for
sheer
flavor
texture
and
drinkability
definately
a
mustrevisit
for
me
aroma
reeks
of
belgium
yeast
and
a
bit
of
sour
funk
quaff
shows
off
a
crisp
and
carbonated
brew
bomb
of
sweet
fruity
mash
slick
and
rich
drinks
like
a
dream
with
its
dry
finish
of
course
a
great
example
of
a
tripel
just
too
high
import
fee
to
make
it
steadily
into
the
dbf
o
easy
quaffing
belgium
in
a
bottle
rock
on
you
men
of
god
d
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
the
8
abv
is
the
only
thing
between
me
and
a
worn
out
liver
amazing
stuff
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
a
massive
three
inches
in
height
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
thick
thunks
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
barnyard
funk
citrus
and
tangy
wheat
the
taste
is
just
as
funky
as
the
aroma
with
lots
of
tang
too
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
again
mfd
a
good
beer
refreshing
but
not
much
to
say
about
it
on
the
whole
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
guess
it
all
went
out
on
the
huge
head
not
alot
of
body
either
it
is
beautiful
in
its
simplicity
but
i
could
not
drink
this
all
night
as
it
would
get
bring
a
light
gusher
upon
opening
pours
a
very
bright
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
fell
slowly
becoming
somewhat
creamy
leaving
behind
some
bubbly
lacing
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
goblet
aroma
is
lemony
light
grassiness
apple
spice
a
small
amount
of
funky
sourness
taste
is
grainy
earthy
hints
of
honey
and
slightly
sweet
almost
cake
batterlike
middle
and
endlessly
dry
on
the
finish
very
aggressive
carbonation
scrubs
the
tongue
this
one
needs
to
mellow
out
a
bit
on
the
table
before
i
continue
on
with
it
yeah
the
carbonation
has
gone
down
a
bit
but
it
doesnt
do
anything
to
help
the
mouthfeel
its
medium
bodied
crisp
dry
a
good
beer
but
definitely
nowhere
near
the
top
of
the
trappists
pours
a
dark
golden
clear
with
nice
carbonation
and
excellent
lacing
smells
light
bready
and
light
fruity
a
little
pilsneresque
a
big
thick
head
that
lasts
tastes
beautifully
comlex
with
light
fruit
and
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
like
the
rest
of
the
trappist
triples
this
is
well
balanced
very
nice
best

pours
a
hazy
straw
yelloworange
with

huge
creamy
white

retention
and
lacing
are
fantasticstill
a
full
onefinger
of
foam
after
almost
ten
minutes
no
sediment
smells
strongly
of
fruit
esters
with
banana
and
pear
coming
through
behind
light
citrus
a
lot
of
bready
doughy
yeast
is
also
predominant
along
with
a
light
spiciness
slightly
tangy
upon
first
tasting
thanks
to
the
yeast
with
sweet
fruitiness
playing
against
spiciness
very
bready
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
chimay
brew
some
bitterness
comes
along
toward
the
end
to
make
this
one
quite
refreshing
i
do
remember
more
hop
presence
from
the
bottles
ive
had
in
belgium
but
this
one
has
crossed
an
ocean
and
sat
for
a
full
year
so
its
easy
to
understand
not
as
syrupy
sweet
as
westmalle
or
many
other
tripels
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
smooth
and
a
nice
weight
not
to
heavy
and
not
to
light
nice
and
very
drinkable
glad
i
got
myself
a
couple
to
keep
in
the
fridge
light
and

notes
this
blond
had
a
lot
of
fun
and
and
loved
every
minute
of
it
not
bad
at
all
poured
a
light
copper
coloration
into
a
pint
glass
the
head
was
a
great
amount
and
reduced
to
a
lingering
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
was
that
of
bananas
of
now
and
later
and
citrus
the
taste
itself
was
out
of
this
world
as
it
just
left
a
overall
great
taste
that
had
you
coming
back
for
more
as
an
unfiltered
it
fell
into
the
complete
taste
and
fullness
that
unfiltered
beers
present
themselves
as
d
hides
the
abv
and
is
nice
and
light
probably
the
most
sessionable
trappist
ive
had
drinkability
is
high
this
is
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
and
is
excellent
with
food
be
careful
and
enjoy
othis
is
an
easy
drinking
triple
the
alcohol
is
present
from
start
to
finish
but
is
never
domineering
it
supplements
all
other
components
of
the
beer
including
mouthfeel
very
wellbalanced
to
the
point
that
its
hard
to
figure
out
what
contributes
certain
aspects
ive
never
noticed
the
urea
scent
before
in
other
beers
its
in
the
background
but
reminds
me
of
a
ballpark
bathroomread
stale
urine
oddly
the
note
wasnt
offensive
which
i
cant
explain
world
class
notes
from
61704
the
aroma
is
yeasty
cheese
like
with
coriander
corn
malt
and
fruit
like
citrus
the
appearance
starts
with
a
huge
head
and
then
slowly
falls
to
reveal
a
golden
ale
with
lots
of
floating
particles
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
most
of
the
alcohol
being
well
hidden
until
the
end
then
you
get
a
slight
warming
the
palate
is
thin
but
ok
d
this
had
the
sweetness
and
the
fruitiness
i
crave
in
the
style
but
fell
just
short
in
the
mouthfeel
department
still
a
damn
fine
tripel
and
one
i
would
gladly
seek
out
again
this
is
my
second
belgium
bond
bier
i
try
overall
im
not
impressed
the
name
suggests
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
the
8abv
means
it
is
either
a
bspa
or
a
tripel
overall
i
would
say
the
beer
fits
the
bspa
mold
better
and
it
is
certainly
a
good
beer
bordering
on
being
too
sweet
and
without
the
complexity
of
some
other
trappist
offerings
but
still
a
highly
enjoyable
drink
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
highly
i
bought
this
bottle
at
beer
mania
in
brussels
pours
a
murky
golden
orange
color
with
a
meringue
like
white
head
it
actually
looked
like
a
spider
web
for
a
while
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
and
green
apples
light
spice
and
candi
sugar
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
light
candi
sugar
and
pepper
some
honey
and
white
grapes
not
very
complex
in
flavor
but
well
made
the
feel
is
fairly
light
with
very
active
carbonation
the
finish
is
sweet
yet
dry
a
straight
forward
and
simple
bspa
good
flavors
in
nice
balance
the
flavor
profile
is
not
comparable
to
other
bspas
or
tripels
but
this
one
holds
its
own
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
good
clarity
and
a
dense
massive
white
head
aromas
are
exceptionally
fruity
and
full
of
yeasty
phenolics
lots
of
banana
a
touch
of
clove
and
coriander
and
even
some
black
pepper
malt
and
hop
notes
certainly
take
a
back
seat
on
the
palate
a
hugely
carbonated
brew
settles
in
so
smoothly
with
a
real
nice
blend
of
bright
citrus
fruits
and
subtle
spicing
overall
this
is
a
really
smooth
and
incredible
beer
one
definitely
not
overlooking
as
often
as
i
do
at
the
store
too
be
continued
not
bad
d
a
solid
overall
blond
with
good
drinkability
and
goes
down
effortlessly
crisp
refreshing
and
very
enjoyable
as
i
have
noticed
about
all
of
the
trappist
brews
this
achel
is
extremely
drinkable
like
scary
drinkable
considering
if
you
arent
careful
it
can
hit
you
pretty
good
the
only
thing
taking
away
from
drinkability
for
me
is
the
alcohol
content
which
only
means
that
i
would
hesitate
to
enjoy
more
than
say
two
of
these
excellent
example
of
what
a
beer
should
be
if
it
wasnt
for
the
alcohol
i
could
drink
this
all
day
poured
a
dull
hazy
gold
with
specks
of
brown
sedimentyeast
suspended
two
fingers
of
creamy
head
slowly
dissipated
leaving
a
very
small
persistent
layer
of
head
support
by
the
good
carbonation
beneath
overt
smells
of
freshly
baked
breadyeast
also
in
the
nose
was
banana
spicepepper
and
a
scant
touch
of
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
pretty
smooth
and
begins
with
a
doughy
flavor
which
gives
way
to
some
lemon
zestpepper
barely
sweet
the
taste
finishesa
little
hoppy
very
metallic
and
very
drying
although
it
is
trappist
brew
it
really
is
not
that
spectacular
of
a
tripel
i
truly
enjoy
trappist
achel
their
offerings
are
wonderful
examples
of
beer
i
think
ive
always
favoured
their
bruin
but
tonights
rerating
of
the
blond
a
330ml
bottle
that
is
exactly
two
years
past
the
recommended
best
before
has
seriously
thrown
that
into
question
this
is
certainly
a
recommended
try
aged
and
fresh
always
a
pleasure
i
could
easily
finish
a
couple
of
these
without
regard
to
abv
though
more
than
that
in
one
sitting
might
be
a
bit
much
nonetheless
i
throughly
enjoyed
this
beer
this
pours
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
thick
champagnelike
head
smell
is
strong
of
apple
pears
floral
hops
and
yeast
it
has
a
bitter
hops
taste
with
flavors
of
apple
citrus
lemon
grapefruit
along
with
cloves
the
mouthfeel
starts
off
crisp
but
gets
rather
acidic
overall
a
nice
tripel
from
a
trappist
brewery
d
pretty
drinkable
definitely
different
from
other
tripels
i
have
had
with
more
of
a
sweet
character
d
drinkable
would
i
drink
this
all
night
no
but
a
bottle
or
two
with
a
nice
book
sounds
like
a
nice
night
in
some
of
the
staff
i
have
spoken
to
at
the
moan
and
dove
one
of
my
favorite
bars
in
amherst
have
voiced
their
love
and
dedication
to
this
particular
trappist
brewery
so
i
guess
that
is
why
i
picked
up
this
brew
which
i
have
not
tasted
in
the
past
poured
in
to
my
rapscallion
glass
an
orange
coloration
with
a
very
good
looking
large
frothy
white
heading
aroma
reveals
yeasty
spice
green
apple
skin
hint
of
mango
and
some
leafy
green
hop
taste
is
largely
fruity
mostly
a
pear
flavor
shadowed
by
a
metallic
finish
light
in
body
and
pretty
drinkable
for
a
tripel
while
this
might
be
the
smallest
of
the
trappist
breweries
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
the
best
or
put
as
much
faith
in
to
it
as
my
friends
in
western
massachusetts
sorry
but
i
have
a
feeling
they
are
playing
a
favorite
game
based
on
image
as
opposed
to
quality
of
product
this
along
with
their
dubbel
are
great
beers
but
arent
nearly
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
trappist
examples
imo
this
might
be
a
good
beginning
point
for
beer
drinkers
getting
in
to
the
whole
trappist
thing
cheers
drinkability
decent
its
reasonably
balanced
and
easy
going
for
an
8
blonde
overall
this
was
a
fairly
enjoyable
brew
id
share
it
with
friends
during
a
springsummer
outing
although
it
was
a
little
too
pricy
to
make
it
a
regular
session
beer
very
drinkable
beer
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
its
not
my
favorite
trappist
beer
but
at
8
its
darn
good
and
easy
to
drink
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
tons
of
white
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
wild
yeast
and
pine
hops
more
bitterly
scented
than
expected
it
had
a
very
strong
citrus
flavor
at
first
but
that
mellowed
out
significantly
over
time
it
had
an
oily
texture
and
was
quite
carbonated
with
a
mild
but
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
alcohol
was
surprisingly
noticeable
in
the
flavor
and
aftertaste
overall
this
was
slightly
better
than
the
average
belgian
light
ale
but
still
not
that
great
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
trippel
but
not
my
favorite
it
pours
a
prodigious
very
white
soapy
and
frothy
head
that
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
is
a
hazy
orange
and
very
appealing
the
haziness
formed
an
interesting
cloudy
nebula
in
the
glass
as
it
was
held
up
to
the
light
i
dont
believe
ive
seen
this
before
there
were
no
yeasty
bits
which
is
a
plus
the
smell
is
very
very
appealing
candied
sugars
coriander
apple
banana
all
the
typical
belgian
smells
if
you
like
belgian
ales
the
smell
will
entice
the
taste
is
slightly
disappointing
in
that
i
had
really
high
expectations
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
less
syrupy
fewer
candied
sugars
not
as
much
banana
as
i
would
have
liked
youll
get
some
peppery
spiciness
and
more
alcohol
notes
that
i
care
for
there
is
a
yeasty
snap
to
this
beer
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
it
does
have
its
weaknesses
though
im
going
to
review
their
bruin
8
next
lchaim
overall
a
very
nearly
perfectly
puttogether
blonde
more
in
the
style
of
a
blonde
than
a
tripel
smooth
drinkable
fullbodied
and
flavourful
not
enormously
complex
but
i
dont
think
the
style
is
meant
to
be
a
beer
of
this
quality
could
age
quietly
and
gracefully
for
years
mellowing
even
further
for
now
it
loses
a
few
points
because
of
the
metal
on
the
finish
the
thai
food
the
sicklysweetness
and
the
overzealous
head
upon
pouring
otherwise
outstanding
recommended
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
typical
small
achel
bottle
into
a
tuliped
burgundy
glass
the
beer
had
a
warm
orange
color
and
the
head
was
strong
and
full
almost
like
meringue
there
were
notable
amounts
of
yeasty
globs
the
bouquet
was
inviting
smelling
of
citrus
and
malts
upon
tasting
i
found
grapefruits
caramel
candy
sugars
and
slight
alcohol
warming
the
mouthfeel
was
great
champagne
liveliness
that
excited
my
tongue
i
think
this
is
a
great
belgian
and
is
very
well
executed
for
the
style
i
wont
have
this
too
often
unless
i
am
teaching
a
friend
about
trappist
beer
or
have
a
specific
craving
upon
seeing
the
bottle
a
very
good
tripel
the
appearance
really
stands
out
on
this
one
amazing
head
and
lace
flavour
is
not
as
complex
as
other
trappist
tripels
like
chimay
and
westmalle
overall
a
very
good

list
d
good

alcohol
is
present
but
not
offensive
tastes
are
relatively
light
for
the
style
and

a
great
sipping
beer
in

overall
this
was
a
great
experience
all
the
flavors
came
together
nicely
without
hitting
you
over
the
head
with
any
one
particular
element
unfortunately
this
was
pretty
hard
to
find
and
at
7
for
a
small
bottle
its
not
something
ill
be
experiencing
very
often
fantastic
when
available
in
sum
it
might
fall
a
bit
short
of
the
westmalle
tripel
but
not
by
much
a
wonderful
trappist
beer
d
no
my
favorite
beer
tastes
like
sourdough

and
hides
the
alcohol
well
this
on
the
2nd
time
i
remember
having
this
beer
and
have
no
notes
from
the
last
time
but
i
will
say
i
will
buy
it
again
but
probably
only
if
i
was
going
to
drink
more
than
one
triple
d
easy
to
drink
it
was
hard
to
notice
the
8

distinguishable

i
bought
this
at

in
wells
maine
for
5
00bottle
all
under
one
sail
overall
of
all
the
trappist
beers
i
have
had
this
is
easily
my
least
favorite
i
dont
know
if
the
beer
was
perhaps
stored
improperly
but
it
certainly
seems
off
to
me
overall
this
is
so
good
to
me
i
know
there
is
higher
rated
belgians
and
ive
had
some
of
them
but
this
is
really
hitting
the
spot
right
now
the
aroma
was
light
and
zesty

some
yeast
a
slight
banana
aroma
with
orange
and
lemon
the
taste
was
lighter
and
more
bitter
than
other
tripels
ive
tried
the
citrus
flavours
and
hops
cleansed
the
palate
and
there
was
less
of
a
yeasty
chalky
aftertaste
or
much
sweetness
from
candi
sugar
low
carbonation
and
medium
body
helped
this
one
go
down
easy
d
maybe
my
favorite
belgian
blondetripel
yet
a
flavorful
beautifully
balanced
beer
with
tantalizing
aroma
and
mouthfeel
ill
look
forward
to
having
this
again
great
beer
that
is
far
underated
in
my
opinion
i
typically
find
that
the
small
bottles
store
better
than
the
larger
ones
but
this
is
one
fantastic
trappist
highly
recommended
and
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
fine
beer
for
me
this
was
reminiscent
more
of
a
wheat
beer
than
a
tripel
again
not
at
all
what
i
would
expect
from
a
trappist
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
brew
not
nearly
as
complex
in
flavor
as
some
other
trappists
nice
and
drinkable
but
maybe
a
bit
too
simple
the
trappists
have
made
better
tripels
but
this
one
holds
its
own
ill
certainly
come
back
to
it
another
time
the
main
impression
of
this
beer
is
yeast
and
canned
pears
after
reviewing
four
quite
good
brews
this
one
stayed
with
me
kind
of
grew
on
me
afterwards
chilled
and
poured
aggressively
into
watou
goblet
nice
thick
one
finger
of
creamy
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
a
wall
of
marsh
mellow
cream
lacing
body
is
slightly
hazy
blond
stray
color
with
peach
tones
and
warm
high
lights
tiny
bubbles
are
present
smells
up
front
of
light
fruit
esters
pears
apple
maybe
even
kiwi
no
banana
or
fruits
from
warmer
fermentation
this
is
my
guess
any
how
i
also
get
a
little
spice
maybe
some
white
pepper
yeast
is
in
there
hops
are
minimal
needless
to
say
great
aromatic
balance
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
move
but
not
get
annoying
begins
with
a
slight
sweet
spiced
character
then
a
into
a
dry
finish
this
is
very
complex
and
subtle
at
the
say
time
all
of
the
fruit
esters
are
apparent
in
the
taste
and
manifest
in
a
great
way
this
beer
is
great
to
drink
alone
but
would
also
be
wonderful
with
food
maybe
some
cheese
and
crackers
or
a
fish
soup
or
fish
period
even
meat
and
potatoes
great
stuff
solid
for
the
style
so
glad
i
tried
it
in
resume
this
was
a
great
surprise
as
it
doesnt
behave
like
your
average
blond
beer
i
really
recomemnd
this
one
i
am
lucky
enough
to
have
tried
beers
from
all
the
trappist
monk
breweries
in
europe
that
i
know
of
this
is
a
long
way
from
the
best
but
still
a
fine
drink
and
i
would
certainly
have
another
but
not
tonight
probably
better
on
a
hot
day
quite
a
way
to
start
a
day
one
is
plenty
d
the
drinkability
was
ok
i
couldnt
see
me
having
more
than
one
of
these
there
are
better
trapist
beers
out
there
ome
people
are
not
so
keen
on
this
trappist
so
my
expectations
were
turned
down
low
systembolaget
started
to
sell
achel
in
the
first
days
of
march
2007
so
i
went
down
and
got
the
8
blonde
and
the
bruin
it
poured
with
a
nice
golden
color
a
little
cloudy
and
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
remains
there
indefinately
the
taste
is
fruity
with
a
tinge
of
yeast
and
a
lot
of
bread
its
actually
very
restrained
for
this
style
of
beer
its
definately
sweet
and
with
some
alohol
coming
through
a
strong
citric
bite
emerges
at
the
end
all
and
all
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
since
it
synthesizes
some
tastes
in
beer
that
i
enjoy
drinkability
this
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
style
but
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
if
it
were
either
more
nuanced
or
less
alcoholic
it
would
be
more
drinkable
but
its
definitely
easy
to
sip
nonetheless
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
apricot
with
a
lot
of
evervescence
there
is
a
solid
one
inch
white
head
on
top
the
aroma
has
hints
or
caramel
with
a
lot
of
lemon
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
has
ripe
fruit
and
malt
flavors
dominating
this
triple
is
much
more
dry
than
many
nontrappist
tripels
which
is
a
good
thing
some
abbey
and
us
tripels
are
quite
sweet
and
not
as
well
attenuated
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
my
only
complaint
is
the
lack
of
yeast
flocculation
i
poured
the
beer
very
slowly
and
after
half
the
bottle
was
in
the
glass
a
lage
lump
of
yeast
splashed
into
the
goblet
and
broke
up
into
small
lumps
d
i
am
glad
i
found
a
case
of
this
beer
along
with
another
kind
from
the
same
brewers
it
is
worth
drinking
but
i
do
not
put
it
at
the
same
level
as
the
other
trappist
brews
i
will
try
their
other
products
however
good
beer
what
a
chunky
monkey
man
even
out
of
the
fridge
the
yeast
was
still
suspended
as
i
tried
to
pour
carefully
lovely
yellow
cloudy
white
capped
beer
with
chunks
a
plenty
the
smell
is
lovely
soft
phenol
joy
the
malt
a
candy
sweetness
the
overall
flavor
is
mighty
it
feels
as
though
it
melts
into
the
tongue
and
awakens
taste
sensors
i
didnt
know
i
had
like
eating
soft
barely
candy
flowers
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
atouch
of
hop
spice
lovely
stuff
just
give
me
less
chunks
but
fuck
it
i
can
suffer
the
chunks
its
not
as
outstanding
as
other
trappist
ales
but
still
is
a
very
nice
tripel
and
fits
well
with
this
great
style
drinkability
the
bitterness
is
quite
nice
this
was
chilled
nicely
and
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
the
initial
smell
was
a
bit
more
bready
and
commercial
smelling
than
i
thought
it
would
be
luckily
the
taste
was
not
there
was
a
beautiful
almost
junior
grand
cru
taste
to
the
malts
in
this
beer
there
was
a
nice
casklike
aged
feel
with
just
enough
bitterness
the
taste
deepened
with
warming
however
it
must
be
said
that
teh
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
champagne
fine
carbonation
that
lasts
throughout
this
creates
fantastic
dryness
and
terrific
drinkability
very
nice
indeed
drinkability

very
creamy
medium
body
with

rugged
and

an
unusual
and
not
entirely
successful
beer
i
must
say
that
although
this
is
a
delicious
beer
the
flavors
didnt
meld
with
each
other
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
slightly
chunky
mouthfeel
almost
viscous
but
not
quite
rather
sweet
with
notes
of
raisins
and
starfruit
accompanied
by
that
bready
yeast
detectable
in
the
aroma
alcohol
is
apparent
upon
swirling
in
the
mouth
and
increases
in
intensity
as
the
beer
warms
an
intriguing
beer
worthy
of
the
trappist
mark
though
not
truly
exceptional
very
sweet
in
the
mouth
leaving
just
a
slight
bitter
taste
followed
by
the
alcohol
not
too
strong
but
you
know
its
there
definitely
recommended
overall
this
is
a
darn
good
blonde
but
out
of
some
of
the
other
trappist
products
i
think
this
one
is
outdone
however
it
is
definitely
a
quality
brew
in
its
own
right
recommended
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definatly
keep
it
stocked
in
my
cellar
all
the
time
it
poured
a
dark
maple
brown
color
with
a
small
bubbly
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
a
nice

alcohol
is
evident

not

another
good
trappist
overall
an
excellent

beautifully

very
enjoyable
pours
with
a
beautiful
fluffy
white

and
a
slightly
cloudy

the

quite
interesting
and
complex
light
sugars
citrus
and
a
minty
note
with
a
strange
saltysea
essence
at
lower
temperatures
as
the
beer
warms
it
throws
off
more
fruit
as
expected
on
the
palate
achel
blond
is
familiar
and
comforting
slight
tart
sweetness
starts
things
off
followed
by
some
citric
acidity
laid
over
a
wonderful
bready
malt
character
the
finish
is
stickysweet
alcohol
is
a
bit
evident
in
the
mouthfeel
but
thats
balanced
by
the
high
malt
content
overall
an
excellent
beer
thats
good
in
all
the
areas
a
beer
should
be
good
in
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
effervescent
bite
that
hits
you
after
the
yeasty
notes
an
interesting
trappist
that
deserves
another
time
round
for
further
contemplation
overall
its
very
lively
and
enjoyable
however
i
prefer
the
brune
as
the
malt
is
a
bit
more
interesting
to
me

the

really

the
pears
achel
blond
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
way
more
foam
than
i
wanted
and
it
was
a
slow
pour
by
my
standards
from
a
brown
33
cl
bottle
the
aroma
is
estery
it
smells
much
like
i
expect
a
tripel
to
taste
tastes
like
a
tripel
should
as
well
although
im
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
describe
the
flavors
very
tasty
beer
recommended
i
highly
recomend
this
triple
in
the
end
this
is
a
pretty
fine
trappist
blonde
well
crafted
and
not
overwhelming
or
overbearing
ill
be
picking
up
more
to
sip
in
the
evenings
now
that
the
days
are
growing
longer
an
ideal
ale
to
help
herald
in
twilight
with
only
one
at
a
time
for
me
though
the
alcohol
content
is
deceptive
in
regards
to
the
flavour
and
mouthfeel
and
the
side
of
my
chalice
now
that
this
is
all
over
and
done
with
is
caked
by
a
good
even
layer
of
sticky
lacing
taste
was
somewhat
sweet
bitter
and
fruity
the
amount
of
carbonation
make
the
beer
very
refreshing
the
typical
belgian
funkiness
is
very
much
present
and
appears
to
be
very
similar
to
the
westmalle
yeast
strain
the
only
difference
with
a
wm
is
the
lower
amount
of
bitterness
and
this
one
is
less
dry
but
nevertheless
a
very
good
beer
worth
a
try
not
bad
but
this
one
wont
have
me
updating
my
list
of
favorite
tripels
i
like
it
better
with
the
yeast
in
and
my
score
reflects
that
glass
a
good
tripel
i
will
revisit
this
one
from
time
to
time

this
is
a
nicely

is

worth
buying

not
amazingly
unique

done
well
adam
d
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
enjoyable
the
appearance
is
a
golden
orange
with
an
extreme
head
the
taste
is
pleasantly
light
on
the
alcohol
undertone
and
is
grainy
after
pouring
in
the
large
clumps
of
yeast
the
taste
was
improved
and
the
drink
took
on
a
more
full
body
the
taste
was
also
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
but
it
didnt
really
become
any
more
complex
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
taste
isnt
as
unique
as
some
other
trappist
beers
flavor
is
fruity
a
little
spice
some
yeast
and
a
slight
bitter
tingle

overall
this

trappist
beer
the

taste
was
an
explosion
of
light
feeling

on
my
tounge
a
very
powerful
hop
bitterness
is
present
in
the

not

over
the
nearly
opaque

i
know
seems
like
an
impossibility
but
there
you
go

nicely
and
the

is
thin
and
delicate
yet
ample
at
the
same
time
aroma
is
spicy
belgian
malts
with
some
sugar
and
alcohol
present
taste
is
an
almost
spiced
wheat
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
citrus
at
the
outset
mouthfeel
puts
it
all
together
with
smooth
and
creamy
and
drinkability
is
also
very
nice
a
great
find
the
head
is
thick
just
offwhite
still
and
bumpy
it
floats
on
the

the

believe
it
everyone
this
brew
is
worth
some
praise
another
great
tripel
very
very
good
very
drinkable
brew
although
i
found
myself
sipping
it
to
enjoy
it
very
drinkable
i
was
not
disappointed
with
this
beer
and
yes
i
would
have
another
clear
golden
colour

of

tangerines
with
follow
on
notes
of
caramel
a
hint
of
butterscotch
and
a
rich
malty
note
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
a
mix
of
tropical
fruit
notes
and
malt
the
beer
is
dry
and
spicy
up
front
with
a
finish
that
has
hints
of
acidity
and
hop
bitterness
as
well
as
a
slight
alcohol
burn
there
is
a
peppery
carbonic
note
here
at
the
beginning
that
is
quite
nice
and
prickly
though
this
is
certainly
not
highly
carbonated
just
nicely
so
there
are
some
fruity
notes
of
pears
apples
and
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
which
is
almost
the
reverse
order
and
intensity
that
the
notes
are
in
the
nose
the
beer
is
also
not
quite
as
rich
as
the
nose
would
suggest
it
is
quite
light
and
easily
quaffable
even
for
an
8
beer
poured
carefully
into
a
belgian
glass
this
is
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
and
a
few
chunks
of
yeast
that
got
into
the
glass

overall
this
is

but
just
doesnt
have
the
complexity
in
flavoraroma
that
other
tripels
have
drinkability
outstanding
beer
worthy
of
any
selfrespecting
bas
palate
at
least
once
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
bit
light
for
the
style
and
the
high
price
and
abv
hurt
the
drinkability
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
poured
a
golden
orange
with
a
heavy

the

abv
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
probably
overpaid
for
this
beer
but
it
was
definitely
tasty
drinkability
not
sure
if
this
beer
has
bowled
me
over
actually
somewhat
bland
in
comparison
to
other
tripels
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
turning
translucent
as
the
beer
thins

smell
is
very
sweet

rich
with
a
citrus
smell
there
is
a
cloudy
haze
which
settles
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
once
it
is
settled
the
taste
is
surprisingly
flat
despite
the
extra
large
head
that
appeared
when
it
was
poured
taste
doesnt
really
come
in
till
it
is
swallowed
when
it
turns
into
a
sour
citrus
which
resonates
with
too
much
alcohol
medium
bodied
achel
8
blond
fits
somewhere
between
good
and
very
good
for
me
id
love
to
drink
it
side
by
side
with
a
few
other
quality
tripels
to
tease
out
the
relevant
differences
and
nail
down
my
preferences
regarding
this
style
once
and
for
all
in
the
final
reckoning
ill
grant
it
just
short
of
greatness
status
rest
assured
ill
be
giving
it
plenty
of
chances
to
change
my
mind
for
the
better
another
great
trappist
ale
i
wish
i
could
find
these
beers
more
often
drinkability
and
overall
it
has
the
potential
but
doenst
fulfill
it
not
bad
but
not
a
very
good
representation
of
what
can
come
from
a
trappist
brwery
in
my
opinion
still
a
decent
brew
this
was
past
due
i
got
it
that
way
in
the
trade
but
didnt
have
time
to
check
the
bottle
not
much
in
the
way
of
taste
inconsistent
taste
carbonation

not
quite
skunked

there

the
end
it

is
a
sharp
bite
not
expected
from
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
i
keep
saying
that
about
tripels
i
love
them
my
favorite
style
but
they
keep
surprising
me
that
the
flavor
is
different
than
the
aroma
doesnt
stop
me
from
loving
them
though
mouthfeel
is
creamy
sweet
flavorful
i
will
have
another
if
someone
buys
it
for
me
pours
hazy
very
pale
gold
with
a
rich

2
fingers
good
retention

excellent

smells
are
a
bit
toned
down
but
light
accents
of
fruits
apples
and
bananas
with
mildy
yeasts
in
the
nose
fruitiness
and
yeasts
mix
well
in
the
taste
to
create
smooth
and
creamy
textures
also
packs
a
nice
alcohol
content
the
alcohol
taste
mingles
well
with
the
rest
so
it
isnt
gross
or
out
of
place
a
very
good
and
enjoyable
brew
i
like
this
brew
but
thats
probably
because
i
like
trappist
beer
not
as
good
as
the
brown
brew
of
this
though
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
an
exceptional
thick
white
head
left
a
beautiful
lacing
on
the
glass
as
well
the
smell
was
probably
the
least
impressive
of
its
traits
almost
smelled
like
a
coors
light
everything
else
about
this
beer
is
wonderful
but
at
such
a
steep
price
tag
i
wouldnt
recommend
more
than
a
single
sampler
33
cl
bottle
04
and
04
notches
tried
a
bottle
of
this
tasty
concoction
at
the
blind
tiger
in

its
a
new
one
on
their

list
poured
a

all
the
way

yeasty

pleasing
on
the
tongue
and
quick
to
the
cranium
very
soft
and
silky
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
with

adding
to
the

poures
a

with
a
nice

spicey
and
some
apple

not
any

like
alot
of
tripels
finishes
smooth
a
real
drinkable
ale
for
the
style
with
alot
of
nice
flavors
not
overly
complex
but
very
solid
ejoying
it
last
sunday
at
the
monestary
from
tap
and
now
again
in
from
the
botle
in
my
trappist
bokaal
goot
to
great
apearance
nice
colour
foam
and
brightness
and
willing
to
go
out
litle
gushing
that
i
noted
earlier
so
i
mad
sure
this
time
but
its
there
pooring
it
in
fast
made
no
problem
so
the
enjoyment
could
begin
nice
nose
with
smooth
fine
hops
litle
fruit
of
the
yeast
and
some
alcoholdamps
nice
and
dry
tast
with
a
just
bitter
enough
aftertaste
imho
a
very
onedimensional
beer
the
tart
overwhelms
the
other
more
subtle
features
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
good
representation
of
a
triple
but
it
is
different
has
a
nice
warming
effect
as
it
goes

a

a

tripel
poured
a
hazy

color
which
had
a
very
thick
head
that
was
fluffy
and
white
leaving
behind
nice
lace
aroma
is
very
citrussy
with
a
lemon
scent
and
a
flat
chalky
yeastiness
taste
has
a
nice
hop
bitterness
up
front
which
segues
into
a
lemony
hop
flavor
with
sweet
light
malt
and
a
generous
amount
of
alcohol
the
body
of
this
ale
is
nearly
perfect
as
the
carbonation
has
very
little
carbonic
bite
while
the
light
moughtfeel
lends
smoothness
and
a
dry
finish
a
nice
belgian
tripel
though
i
have
had
better
this
one
poured
a
huge
frothy
head
with
laced
the
glass
until
i
was
finished
the
color
is
a
brownish
orange
and
smells
yeasty
like
bread
with
a
hint
of
orange
peal
the
flavor
is
spicy
at
first
and
a
little
orange
is
hidden
in
there
it
feels
very
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
watery
finish
the
alcohol
is
present
throughout
overall
the
flavors
are
subtle
leading
to
a
good
mark
for
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
creamflavored
ale
the
nose
offers
butterscotch
baked
apple
banana
vanilla
and
milk
while
the
palate
displays
whipped
creamlike
textures
roasted
nuts
biscuity
grain
and
more
vanilla
never
does
the
alcohol
seem
evident
and
whatever
hop
component
there
is
is
strictly
in
the
background
for
bitterness
its
closest
competition
would
seem
to
be
st
bernardus
tripel
only
that
this
is
less
vinous
and
wild
tasting
beautifully
balanced
and
clean
this
is
clearly
suitable
for
trappist
beer
initiates
mouthfeel
this
pours
out
a
nicely
nice
blond
amber
with
a
large
robust
head
tastes
of
sweet
and
a
nose
of
fruit
with
a
slight
blend
of
spice
just
to
round
things
out
hops
add
some
perfect
balance
this
is
a
wonderfully
crafted
brew
which
perhaps
lies
above
my
total
beer
grasp
smooth
to
the
mouth
adds
to
the
drinkability
notes
very
nice
beer
it
is
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
an
awsome
trappist
drink
i
really
like
this
and
other
than
the
higher
alcohol
content
find
it
very
drinkable
although
it
was
hard
to
find

not

do
i
want
more

i
expect
more
hazy

it
looks
ghostly
a
rocky
white
of
a
finger
in
height
lasted
for
a
moment
before
dissipating
to
a
soapy
residue
the
subsequent
lacing
was
disorganized
pocked
but
prevalent
the
nose
was
rather
lively
with
tart
and
funky
citrusy
lemon
grass
upfront
then
a
note
of
distant
pepper
cloves
and
a
good
amount
of
herbs
can
be
found
in
the
middle
the
finish
shows
the
alcohol
and
yeast
i
like
the
potency
but
the
aromas
dont
really
mix
that
well
each
seemed
a
little
too
naked
i
feared
the
palate
would
be
harsh
it
wasnt
i
mean
wow
this
is
like
night
and
day
the
palate
is
soft
and
well
rounded
yes
there
is
a
raw
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
but
the
medley
of
apples
pears
citrus
fruits
hay
grass
cloves
dates
earthiness
bready
maltiness
and
yeast
really
propel
the
flavors
in
a
tasty
direction
it
manages
to
be
complex
yet
kind
of
straightforward
does
that
make
sense
so
what
it
does
to
me
the
taste
is
enjoyable
but
i
dont
think
this
is
an
outstanding
triple
medium
in
body
with
low
and
natural
carbonation
kind
of
airy
id
say
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
agreeable
i
found
this
to
be
plenty
quaffable
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
more
it
was
costly
for
one
thing
i
bought
my
11
2ounce
bottle
in
iowa
city
it
is
worth
trying
taste
sweetness
itself
with
just
a
dash
of
citric
sour
at
the
edges
but
overall
fruity
peach
apricot
orange
zesty
with
sour
citric
character
returning
but
not
dominating
hops
dance
delicately
and
malt
is
assuredly
around
to
provide
a
plush
pillow
for
the
tastebuds
a
really
wellintegrated
brew
any
initial
harshness
is
soon
mellowfied
and
ease
of
drinkability
is
ensured
mild
all
in
all
for
sure
but
thats
really
what
the
style
is
all
about
very
smooth
i
could
imagine
downing
this
aplenty
if
it
werent
for
the
cost
really
to
smooth
out
financial
matters
the
only
thing
to
do
is
actually
become
a
monastic
brother
and
drink
this
stuff
for
free
aye
thats
what
i
ought
to
do
11
2
oz
bottle
that
is
past
its
prime
according
to
the
label
really
didnt
know
what
i
had
here
until
i
poured
it
a
hazy
honey
colour
in
the
st
bernardus
goblet
chunks
of
yeast
obscure
any
sight
of
bubbles
leaves
nice
chains
of
belgian
lacing
all
over
the
goblet
aroma
is
typical
belgian
with
pink
grapefruit
and
baked
bread
in
the
spotlight
cloves
and
allspice
also
share
top
billing
mouthfeel
is
thick
almost
chewy
and
is
tart
and
bitter
hops
make
more
than
a
cameo
appearance
taste
is
complex
with
biscuity
yeast
sharp
citrus
and
bitter
hops
not
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
tripel
the
yeast
chunks
settle
to
the
bottom
at
room
temperature
but
the
taste
remains
bitter
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
belgian
ales
ive
had
over
the
years
maybe
a
fresher
one
would
change
my
opinion
overall
impression
this
is
the
first
achel
product
ive
tried
and
im
quite
impressed
if
the
rest
are
as
good
or
better
then
i
might
have
a
contender
for
my
new
favorite
trappist
brewery
here
could
it
be
that
the
youngest
trappist
brewery
is
giving
the
old
stalwarts
a
run
for
their
money
poured
from
the
classic
11
2
oz
belgian
bottle
its
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
swirling
traces
on
top
of
the
beer
even
with
a
careful
pour
prodigious
chunks
of
yeast
are
left
floating
around
the
smell
is
candy
sugar
spice
notes
of
crisp
fruit
and
a
pleasant
alcohol
aroma
the
taste
is
everything
a
tripel
should
be
with
a
nice
dose
of
yeast
rounding
things
out
thanks
to
the
gents
at
the
monastary
notes
fantastic
this
beer
is
a
dream
come
true
for
me
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
good
hefeweizen
but
with
the
complexity
of
a
tripel
unbelievable
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
honey
caramel
color
with
little
bits
of
yeasty
goodness
float
about
a
big
white
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
amount
of
lace
in
its
wake
a
damp
earthy
smell
and
aroma
of
yeast
and
hops
lasts
fairly
long
the
malt
is
a
bit
bread
doughy
a
wide
variety
of
flavors
emerge
sweet
sugar
yeast
coriander
orange
zest
caramel
and
alcohol
are
all
quite
separate
and
distinct
the
overall
effect
reminds
me
of
a
mixed
drink
named
perfect
john
2
fl
oz
vodka
1
fl
oz
triple
sec
curacao
and
4
fl
oz
orange
juice
this
is
a
highly
underrated
triple
imho
opened
this
one
to
celebrate
the
finish
of
a
semesterlong
project
not
a
bad
tripel
not
up
there
amongst
the
best
yet
though
then
again
westmalle
has
been
making
tripels
for
100
years
while
achel
hasnt
for
even
5
so
im
sure
they
can
improve
the
recipe
and
make
this
a
true
classic
id
probably
have
this
one
again

tones
blend
with
some
great
yeasty
bready
tones
and
fruity

to
create
a
very
nice
smelling
experience
onto
the
taste
the
flavors
are
quite
delicate
and
theres
barely
a

alcohol
in
the
flavor

yeast
dough

all
blend
quite
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
very
attractive
smooth
and
velvety
easy
drinking
i
could
view
this
as
a
session
beer
its
that
easy
to
drink
the
only
problem
is
that
a
session
of
14
of
these
would
cost
me
close
to
100
no
thanks
good
beer
nonetheless
poured
with
a
tall
thick
head
and
a
hazy
golden
body
lots
of
carbonation
to
be
seen
and
plenty
of
yeast
floaters
the
smell
had
a
lot
of
substance
to
it
with
a
buttered
popcorn
aroma
prevailing
the
taste
was
also
very
substantial
and
ill
be
damned
if
i
didnt
taste
a
little
broccoli
not
nasty
tv
dinner
broccoli
though
more
like
mammas
home
cooked
broccoli
smothered
in
cheese
sauce
ok
the
cheese
sauce
part
i
made
up
but
its
still
one
of
the
more
flavorful
tripels
ive
had
pours
a
light
hazy
goldennumerous
chunksattractive
lace
that
leaves
a
delicate
and
rather
elegant
stick
pattern
aromas
are
very
appealing
light
lemony
citrus
followed
by
creamy
peach
like
sweetness
and
a
big
hint
of
the
maltomeal
to
come
and
boy
is
this
a
delicious
malty
beer
ive
found
a
malt
that
my
taste
buds
adore
exceptional
crispness
helps
balance
this
brew
out
served
with
baked
codcrabmeat

the
cod
surrounded
by

and

man
the
malty
flavors
of
the
beer
and
the
complex
tastes
of
the
seafood
continue
on
in
a
long
glorious
finish
what
is
wrong
with
the
brewer
and
the
importers
of
this
beer
this
is
not
identified
as
either
blond
or
brune
on
the
bottle
anywhere
the
goal
is
to
put
your
drinkers
in
a
bad
mood
before
they
pour
a
glass
source
liquid
solutions
i
think
im
starting
to
like
this
belgian
stuff
as
this
beer
impressed
me
with
its
strong
malty
flavors
the
couldy
golden
body
had
a
nice
thin
head
and
laced
well
the
overall
nose
screamed
malts
and
offered
little
in
the
way
of
alternatives
except
perhaps
for
a
bit
bready
yeasts
and
some
hint
of
citrus
hops
thickly
bodied
but
not
quite
over
the
top
it
could
get
there
on
any
brew
run
as
with
many
goods
foods
and
drinks
the
body
can
only
handle
so
much
of
a
good
thing
i
e
id
like
to
drink
more
but
cant
hazy

with
notes
of
pear

and
a

flavors
include
herbal
mildly
bitter
hops
passion
fruit
apple
yeast
and
mild
rushes
of
alcohol
and
sugar
on
the
finish
complex
but
by
all
means
drinkable
smooth
fullbodied
and
relatively
creamy
mouthfeel
works
well
the
alcohol
content
does
show
itself
a
bit
too
much
for
this
to
be
considered
overly
quaffable
a
quality
trappist
ale
to
be
certain
serve
this
at
cellar
temperature
to
discover
the
abundant
flavors
lurking
within
drinkability

i
thought
the
hops
were
too
prevalent
for
the
style
but
this
is
an
all
around
nice
beer
to
drink
poured
a
pale
yellow
gold
haze
color
started
off
with
a
full
sticky
foam
that
was
white
in
color
but
fell
shortly
after
to
a
small
film
on
the
top
some
lace
was
present
and
had
a
sticky
quality
to
it
sediment
was
noticeable
all
through
the
glass
and
in
the
bottle
mental
note
pour
carefully
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
spicy
yeast
bread
citrus
sweet
malt
bananas
coriander
and
cloves
fairly
sweet
in
the
nose
and
it
was
soft
in
nature
as
for
taste
i
experienced
flavors
of
sweet
malt
honey
spices
cloves
yeast
fruits
banana
citrus
bread
slight
bitter
hop
and
a
small
hint
of
alcohol
it
finished
on
the
dry
side
nice
blend
of
spicysweet
and
dry
flavors
body
was
on
the
creamy
medium
side
this
beer
had
characteristics
of
complexity
when
it
came
to
its
combination
of
flavors
and
the
balance
they
took
on
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
as
well
considering
the
alcohol
level
of
8
i
rather
enjoyed
it
and
would
drink
again
when
pourred
into
glass
the
head
quickly
dissipate
but
reveal
a
beautiful
cloudy
golden
ale
smells
of
hopps
and
yeast
emerge
from
this
beer
with
a
very
sweet
finish
very
fine
trappist
beer
hides
very
well
the
strong
alcohol
taste
can
go
wrong
with
this
brew
there
was
a
medium
white
creamy
head
with
finemedium
bubbles
when
this
brew
was
poured
into

the
body
was
a

the
lacing
was
excellent
on
the
sides
of

there
was
carbonation
observed
with
this

the
aroma
was

there
was

the
taste
is
very
full
and
reminds
me
of
a
weiss
beer
i
really
didnt
enjoy
the
taste
much
because
the
wheaty
flavor
is
not
something
that
i
have
ever
grown
accustomed
to
i
couldnt
drink
very
much
of
this
just
because
i
really
dont
like
the
flavor
f
a
thank
you
goes
to
mjr
for
sending
me
this
beer
and
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
try
it
beer
but
its
playing
with
the
big
boys
from
belgium
notes
this
reminds
me
of
westmalle
tripel
in
a
way
though
i
much
more
prefer
westmalle
this
is
a
good
tripel
but
i
am
just
not
as
impressed
drinkability
scary
i
went
through
this
one
really
quickly
if
i
could
get
this
stuff
in
sixpacks
at
a
good
price
it
would
be
downright
dangerous
not
one
of
the
best
trappists
but
still
quite
tasty
i
sampled
this
at
a
beer
tasting
event
from
a
750
ml
bottle
it
poured
to
give
a
hazy
straw
colored
beer
with
little
foam
the
smell
was
fruity
banana
and
pear
and
malty
the
taste
was
light
and
fruity
grapes
with
a
moderate
amount
of
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
crisp
the
drinkability
was
very
good
this
ale
was
very
refreshing
this
beer
poured
a
light
cloudy
gold
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
head
that
left
circular
lace
a
small
bit
of
carbonation
is
present
it
had
an
aroma
of
malt
clove
and
citrus
the
flavor
was
of
malt
citrus
and
banana
the
finish
was
a
touch
tart
not
a
bad
beer
for
this
style
the
pour
is
a
hazy
golden
yellow
the
head
mighty
in
size
creamy
in
texture
and
bright
white
in
color
the
lace
clings
to
the
glass
in
thick
sheets
nose
is
bubble
gum
lime
like
tones
malt
sweet
also
quite
clean
and
appealing
front
is
sweet
the
top
is
skimpy
the
finish
is
considerate
in
its
acidity
graciously
hopped
with
the
aftertaste
dry
and
kindly
bitter
nice
drinking
beer
slightly
hazy
appearance
but
with
a
bone
white
fluffy
head
aromas
of
floral
hops
and
fruity
esters
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
so
damn
complex
it
makes
me
shiver
just
thinking
about
it
first
it
has
the
classic
wheat
flavors
of
clove
an
banana
then
you
notice
the
hops
then
a
slight
chocolate
and
cinnamon
flavor
invades
then
a
slight
prune
fruitiness
and
finally
the
floral
and
earthy
hop
flavor
lingers
on
your
tounge
it
is
a
little
sweet
but
the
late
hop
charge
balances
it
nicely
when
i
had
it
at
the
bier
circus
in
brussels
i
wanted
to
dive
into
the
glass
and
drown
a
happy
man
the
best
beer
i
had
in
belgium
dont
know
why
the
lackluster
reviews
here
maybe
it
doesnt
travel
well
it
was
head
and
shoulders
better
than
the
westmalle
triple
and
was
definitely
not
light
in
mouthfeel
in
fact
it
was
very
creamy
bright
clear
gold
body
with
white
bubbly
head
dancing
streams
of
bubbles
twist
upward
in
the
glass
i
didnt
realize
the
trappist
monks
knew
what
filtration
was
but
this
manages
to
be
an
attractive
beer
anyway
although
i
had
to
knock
the
score
down
a
bit
because
of
the
lackluster
head
yeasty
aroma
is
subdued
but
still
there
flavor
is
spiced
citrus
this
is
a
nice
light
enjoyable
beer
some
similar
belgians
have
a
dry
cottony
moutfeel
that
i
dont
like
but
this
has
a
wetter
moutfeel
that
makes
it
much
easier
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
quite
a
potent
little
brew
hazy
orange
appearance
with
bits
of
sediment
here
and
there
i
docked
5
of
appearance
for
that
smells
a
bit
sweet
but
very
strong
good
bittering
on
the
finish
i
got
things
like
apricot
apple
in
the
flavour
very
nice
but
potent
goes
straight
to
your
head
bright
golden
in
color
slight
citrus
and
sweetness
on
the
nose
and
can
definatly
smell
the
maltyness
but
richer
and
fuller
than
most
of
your
sweet
trips
like
matt
maples
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
different
than
what
i
actually
got
it
was
described
as
a
tripel
well
sort
of
so
i
had
some
odd
ideas
in
my
head
anyhoo
this
ale
was
pale
golden
and
fairly
clear
it
had
a
decent
head
which
left
a
fair
amount
of
lace
as
the
beer
retreated
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
much
hoppier
than
i
expected
with
undertones
of
grain
almost
haylike
the
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
with
nice
but
not
overpowering
hop
flavor
there
was
also
a
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
yeast
present
as
well
all
in
all
a
good
refreshing
beer
it
is
fruity
citrusy
sweet
and
more
hoppy
than
other
belgians
golden
in
color
and
a
wonderfully
rocky
head
what
really
threw
me
was
the
level
of
hop
bittrerness
for
a
belgian
i
must
say
that
my
expectations
got
in
the
way
i
was
expecting
something
totaly
awsome
and
what
i
got
was
a
good
beer
i
would
bet
good
money
that
when
fresh
that
it
has
a
lot
more
hop
flavor
than
i
got
out
of
this
one
i
mostly
just
got
bitterness
as
my
review
stadns
it
is
a
good
but
rather
uniquely
bitter
belgian
trappist
