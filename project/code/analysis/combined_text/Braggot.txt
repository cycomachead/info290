i
dont
really
get
this
beer
it
feels
like
an
experiment
from
a
homebrewer
lets
brew
something
from
all
thing
i
got
at
home
a
little
too
unclean
and
hoppy
with
notes
of
crisp
bread
from
the
rye
malt
and
sour
dough
wheat
malt
with
some
odd

if
this
didnt
cost

bottle
id
drink
it
more

still
a

brew
that
i
think
is
a

unappreciated

some

with

little
carbonation
i
ending
up
drinking
the
whole
thing
in
one
night
but
it
was
a
slow
process
it
was
better
a
little
warmer
than
completely
cold
it
was
my
first
and
maybe
only
braggot
for
a
long
while
i
havent
seen
many
just
this
and
sam
adams
honey
queen
but
i
would
also
not
buy
it
again
but
i
did
enjoy
the
experience
poured
from
a
purple
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
muddled
amberbrown
coloring
with
a
thin
low
profile
tan
head
aromas
of
rich
honey
sweet
berry
floral
and
herbal
highlights
and
rich
caramel
notes
flavors
are
tangy
and
richly
sweet
forward
with
a
blast
of
berry
sweet
and
tart
on
the
forward
tongue
a
solid
caramel
and
honey
backbone
and
a
vegetal
and
herbal
highlight
full
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
tangy
sweet
blend
of
marionberry
and
honey
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
has
a
slight
edge
from
subtle
carbonation
which
helps
clean
the
finish
a
bit
but
there
is
still
a
considerable
linger
on
the
smooth
feel
good
beer
this
has
a
pleasant
appearance
and
a
decent
but
unremarkable
aroma
unfortunately
the
flavors
are
nothing
like
nose
and
the
mouth
feel
was
gag
worthy
this
was
a
drain
pour
o
easier
to
drink
than
i
expected
due
to
a
lighter
amount
of
sweetness
than
i
expected
for
the
style
alcohol
could
be
a
little
better
hidden
but
the
strength
of
this
one
makes
it
a
slow
sipper
brown
ale
flavors
nut
chocolate
and
berry
not
the
worst
thing
ive
had
from
rogue
when
first
poured
it
was
a
hazy
purple
tone
nice
smell
of
berries
lingered
but
upon
taste
the
flavors
were
muddled
for
me
i
ont
know
if
i
let
my
bottle
sit
too
long
but
the
nose
did
not
match
up
to
the
taste
for
me
serving
type
bottle
delightful
surprise
with
this
one
on
the
nose
and
flavor
and
most
importantly
drinkability
dark
brown
color
hazy
some
floaties
too
nose
is
sweet
n
fruity
palate
offers
big
fruit
some
pleasant
sourness
and
fruity
sour
finish
that
is
quite
nice
no
way
in
hell
this
one
is
actually
11
so
easy
to
drink
its
an
uncommon
style
and
this
is
an
enjoyable
drink
overall
a
complex
heavy
beer
that
would
go
well
with
a
stinky
cheese
and
strong

is

i
liked
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
sweet
drinks
overall
while
at
first
i
was
a
little
put
off
it
really
grew
on
me
sip
after
sip
it
has
a
complex
flavor
profile
with
a
good
balancing
feel
and
a
rather
intriguing
smell
while
fairly
pricey
this
is
certainly
one
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
o
definitely
an
adventure
and
worth
trying
to
appreciate
the
range
of
tastes
beer
can
provide
i
admire
the
audacity
and
craftsmanship
that
went
into
this
beer
my
hats
off

i
would
not

out
again
pretty

recent
reviewers
have
made
good
comments
if
youre
going
to
try
a
braggot
this
will
give
you
a
good
introduction
but
its
definitely
a
fat
brawling
remarkable
beverage
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
olive
tree
market
in
ob
san
diego
o
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
good
the
flavors
and
complexity
are
there
but
it
does
have
a
lot
of
sweetness
fairly
complex
but
drinkable
enough
probably
the
best
example
if
this
style
i
can
remember
having
in
addition
to
the
cool
purple
bottle
this
rogue
beer
provides
plenty
to
like
i
could
get
used

this

and
very

on
for
the
big

a
very
enjoyable
offering
to
be
fair
this
was
strong
and
having
someone
to
finish
this
off
with
was
probably
for
the
better
when
asked
what
a
braggot
was
i
had
to
reply
to
him
that
i
had
no
idea
but
after
reading
more
about
the
style
and
finishing
this
off
id
have
to
say
that
anyone
giving
a
go
would
be
wise
to
start
off
here
there
was
a
hint
of
floral
notes
to
this
too
ensuring
that
this
was
not
too
heavy
boozy
or
spicy
this
was
really
enjoyable
and
worth
seeking
out
again
if
for
no
other
reason
than
because
i
havent
had
anything
quite
like
this
before
a
nice
addition
to
rogues
eccentric
lineup
o
very
unique
and
interesting
creative
like
the
mild
sweetness
from
the
honey
the
hidden
abv
makes
for
a
dangerous
long
lasting
bottle
a
dangerously
easy
drinking
beer
and
quite
possibly
the
strongest
beer
i
have
yet
sampled
although
technically
not
a
straight
beer
but
rather
a
mix
of
fermented
malt
beer
honey
mead
and
possibly
also
fermented
marionberry
wine
a
great
attempt
at
an
old
and
scarcely
known
style
for
which
this
brewery
deserves
applause
bravo
why
they
have
been
around
so
long
they
take
chances
and
some
times
they
create
some
crazy
weird
off
beat
thing
that
rocks
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
it
has
a
maghony
color
body
with
a
small
thin
head
the
smell
has
a
honey
and
fruit
aroma
the
taste
has
a
tart
berry
flavor
up
front
with
a
little
honey
it
also
has
a
little
hop
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
good
and
overall
a
flavorful
beer
this
was
my
first
braggot
my
girlfriend
picked
this
one
up
because
she
liked
the
bottle
i
admittedly
like
it
too
and
she
loves
fruit
beers
havent
had
much
braggot
either
so
i
opened
this
up
with
much
anticipation
it
ours
a
dark
purple
to
mahogany
color
dense
and
hard
to
tell
if
its
cloudy
or
just
too
think
to
let
any
light
shine
through
the
head
is
pinky
cream
colored
and
fizzles
out
rather
quickly
an
aroma
of
fresh
pulped
berries
and
sticky
sweet
meadow
honey
arises
with
very
little
real
alcohol
heat
or
harshness
which
surprises
me
at
this
strength
i
taste
the
berries
first
in
the
flavor
and
while
i
havnt
had
much
experience
with
the
marionberry
it
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
blueberry
and
blackberry
and
elderberry
here
its
deeply
purple
skins
tart
like
wine
grapes
and
elderberries
but
the
fruit
appears
to
be
very
sweet
and
in
combination
with
the
honey
its
gorgeous
almost
medicinal
in
that
i
feel
like
its
almost
good
for
me
despite
the
alcohol
honey
is
fresh
and
floral
and
different
from
other
honey
beers
because
i
can
actually
taste
it
its
sweet
but
never
offensively
so
and
its
actually
pretty
well
carbonated
despite
looking
flat
it
drinks
heavy
though
especially
as
it
warms
turning
into
almost
english
barleywine
bu
the
fruity
character
remains
dominant
i
liked
this
beer
far
more
than
i
ever
though
i
would
i
have
a
new
appreciation
for
both
the
fruit
here
and
the
braggot
style
which
i
need
to
find
more
of
and
continue
this
trip
id
like
to
see
more
rogue
around
shelves
in
colorado
everytime
i
have
a
new
beer
from
them
it
surpasses
my
expectations
this
is
awesome
stuff
my
first
time
trying
this
style
it
seems
close
to
a
barleywine
good
for
the
summer
months
this
was
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
would
try
others
of
this
style
but
i
probably
wouldnt
come
back
to
this
one
o
not
necessarily
my
favorite
style
but
definitely
not
my
least
favorite
either
its
a
strong
fruitforward
beer
with
its
sweetness
balance
by
warm
alcohol
great
mix
of
sweet
tangy
and
dry
the
alcohol
is
almost
undetectable
this
was
a
nice
surprise
o
i
have
few
complaints
with
this
ale
though
i
still
tend
to
be
of
the
opinion
that
braggot
just
isnt
my
thing
still
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
and
fans
of
the
style
should
be
pleased
overall
id
refused
to
try
another
rogue
after
the
pumpkin
ale
incident
last
october
out
in
virginia
beach
until
i
saw
this
its
pretty
nice
overall
and
makes
me
more
willing
to
try
more
rogue
varieties
again
NA
NA
NA
taste
follows
the
nose
it
just
seems
the
flavors
arent
dancing
in
rhythm
a
slight
sweetness
not
honey
so
much
a
very
slight
hop
presence
not
sure
if
i
like
this
beer
seems
average
this
was
my
first
braggot
so
i
was
unsure
of
what
to
expect
but
i
ended
up
enjoying
this
beer
quite
a
bit
bottle
says
stout
blended
w
honey
and
flavors
for
that
seem
to
hold
true
d
ive
only
had
one
other
braggot
and
this
one
didnt
quite
stand
up
to
it
that
said
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
its
quite
unique
and
a
very
nice
effort
on
the
part
of
the
folks
at
crabtree
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
it
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
foam
was
brown
color
with
slight
green
tinting
the
drink
itself
is
dark
brown
hue
like
used
motor
oil
the
smell
is
that
of
roasted
malts
with
a
sweet
tones
of
caramel
the
taste
of
the
beer
itself
is
that
of
a
honey
malt
and
an
alcohol
base
this
beer
is
a
good
beer
one
that
i
wouldnt
want
day
and
night
but
a
good
change
within
the
order
of
beers
it
it
good
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
couldnt
do
more
than
a
bomber
of
this
it
is
worth
trying
but
probally
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
overall
an
interesting
beer
mixing
honey
and
an
imperial
stout
a
little
much
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
this
is
my
first
beer
from
crabtree
but
i
liked
it
its
creative
well
crafted
and
tasty
the
sweetness
is
overly
intense
but
a
very
exciting
beer
overall
i
was
real
excited
to
try
this
beer
not
a
bad
attempt
at
all
i
really
liked
the
fusion
of
the
english
mild
and
sweetness
of
the
honey
if
the
imperial
stout
fused
in
this
beer
was
better
than
average
this
would
be
one
hell
of
a
beer
the
taste
is
both
smoother
and
more
biting
than
the
smell
would
indicate
theres
a
notable
dry
honey
flavor
with
a
bit
ginger
and
clove
this
combo
gives
the
complexity
of
this
beer
the
body
is
rich
and
the
carbonation
appropriate
ive
been
meaning
to
try
some
baklava
but
have
never
been
in
the
right
place
to
do
so
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuit
light
cinnamon
honey
and
light
yellow
cake
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
candied
orange
peel
some
mild
dark
fruits
and
a
lingering
sense
of
vague
tartness
somewhere
in
the
ether
the
body

wtf
ive
never
even
had
a
braggot
before
so
i
have
no
baseline
but
this
beersortof
is
craycray
o
a
very
interesting
beer
very
lemony
and
almost
one
sided
but
not
quit
there
seems
like
it
missed
the
mark
but
the
other
flavors
might
have
faded
pretty
tasty
for
what
it
is
but
it
takes
a
lot
to
dig
past
the
lemon
o
it
is
different
i
believe
this
is
only
the
second
beer
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
its
a
great
change
of
pace
rich
looking
clear
amber
pour
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
reminiscent
of
sweet
white
grapes
with
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
and
flintstone
vitamins
yes
you
read
correctly
the
taste
is
more
potent
with
a
forefront
of
tart
white
grapeslemon
a
slight
nuttiness
and
a
honey
finish
this
beer
is
very
well
executed
in
my
opinion
boasting
lots
of
fruit
and
spice
but
lacks
in
the
alcohol
presence
that
i
expected
o
my
first
braggot
im
not
sure
what
to
think
its
not
quite
a
normal
beer
not
quite
a
mead
lots
of
additional
flavors
thrown
in
which
are
quite
well
balanced
and
make
for
a
roller
coaster
of
tastes
i
didnt
get
much
in
the
way
of
walnuts
but
everything
else
was
there
in
spades
d
this
was
my
first
braggot
so
i
have
no
clue
if
this
is
good
representation
of
the
style
still
though
this
is
truly
and
utterly
bizarre
a
bit
drain
pour
worthy
depending
on
your
expectations
o
im
not
really
caring
for
this
one
at
all
just
not
my
type
of
thing
we
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
3
5
d
decent
but
i
enjoy
this
a
lot
more
fresh
it
seems
that
i
enjoy
most
jos

ontap

is
murky
dark

with
off

the
nose
is
sweet
an
much
of
honey
the
cinnamon
spice
comes
through
a
fair
bit
and
the

taste
is
simple
honey
some
in
fermented
sugar
decent
spice
to
it
full
body
syrupy
strong
carb
with
a
sugary
finish
was
really
excited
to
try
this
brew
since
braggots
arent
usually
that
popular
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
amber
color
the
head
was
fizzy
and
white
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
different
than
expected
the
lemon
zest
was
in
there
for
sure
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
honey
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
also
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
the
flavors
of
the
lemon
and
spice
worked
well
together
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
had
a
good
level
of
carbonation
to
it
and
was
medium
bodied
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
makes
me
want
to
check
out
jackieos
a
little
more
o
fine
for
what
it
is
think
this
could
potentially
be
finetuned
to
be
more
representative
of
actual
baklava
not
bad
overall
i
was
really
excited
when
i
heard
that
this
beer
would
be
at
the
release
the
aftertaste
is
just
wonderful
the
spices
and
sweetness
mix
very
well
o
captures
the
namesake
very
well
i
was
expecting
something
completely
different
based
on
the
name
heavy
and
sweet
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
tasty
dry
spiceforward
beer
this
is
a
good
cold
weather
beer
that
manages
to
be
light
and
not
sugary
well
done
brad
cant
wait
to
see
how
you
tweak
this
one
and
hopefully
it
becomes
a
regular
jackie
os
im
not
exactly
a
braggot
expert
though
so
what
the
hell
do
i
know
its
definitely
drinkable
and
i
like
baklava
but
i
probably
wouldnt
order
it
again
theres
just
some
quality
to
it
thats
offputting
to
me
i
can
appreciate
the
brewer
for
trying
something
new
though
mouthfeel
and
overall
easily
drinkable
and
fresh
perfect
for
a
crisp
fall
day
i
was
expecting
a
bit
of
a
bolder
body
but
still
good
big
thanks
goes
out
to
mikesgroove
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
during
the
halloween
festivities
at
his
house
thanks
buddy
served
from
growler
into
a
bells
stemmed
tulip
poured
redorange
with
a
very
minimal
offwhite
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
caramel
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
fruit
subtle
dark
chocolate
and
honey
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
i
do
not
usually
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
braggots
but
this
one
wasnt
that
bad
it
had
a
very
nice
sweetness
going
on
that
made
it
drinkable
for
myself
the
dark
chocolate
aspect
definitely
balanced
out
the
sweetness
quite
nicely
on
this
one
to
make
it
just
right
rich
dark
amber
color
that
was
somewhat
hazy
and
cloudy
a
nice
head
of
white
came
up
over
the
top
and
settled
down
into
a
thin
veil
that
stayed
on
top
throughout
the
session
the
aroma
was
loaded
with
grains
nice
light
fruit
notes
hints
of
honey
and
a
light
bit
of
alcohol
nice
sharp
bite
as
i
take
my
first
taste
rich
flavor
here
more
so
then
i
have
seen
in
the
style
before
nice
flavor
of
honey
soaked
oak
that
came
across
the
tonge
very
quickly
smooth
mellow
carbonation
really
let
the
flavor
explore
the
palate
as
light
noted
of
fruit
peaches
and
nice
touches
of
light
grain
and
spice
very
intresting
and
very
smooth
with
almost
no
hotness
even
with
the
very
high
alcohol
in
this
one
overall
another
really
big
winner
from
the
guys
up
north
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
not
sure
if
im
a
fan
of
the
style
or
what
so
i
cant
say
its
a
bad
example
of
a
braggot
that
said
i
would
probably
skip
if
offered
up
and
drink
something
else
brad
has
on
tap
d
its
in
the
top
10
braggots
ive
had
but
that
isnt
saying
much
this
one
seemed
to
polarize
our
tasting
group
as
a
few
people
immediately
dumped
their
glasses
while
others
went
for
a
refill
interesting
concept
but
the
execution
could
have
been
stronger
thanks
jason
o
nice
beer
interesting
concept
tasty

overall
good

flavor
best
braggot
ive
ever
had
overall
drinkability
a
definite
slow
sipper
pretty
quickly
after
the
first
few
sips
i
can
start
to
feel
the
alcohol
so
one
is
enough
per
night
but
so
very
interesting
that
i
keep
wanting
to
go
back
and
sip
more
and
figure
out
all
the
flavors
i
think
i
should
have
laid
in
another
bottle
of
this
and
let
it
age
this
has
such
complexity
that
i
think
it
could
keep
me
interested
for
a
very
long
time
truly
and
amazing
beer
o
i
commend
sprecher
for
stepping
outside
their
box
with
beyond
this
is
clearly
a
far
cry
from
most
of
the
beers
they
produce
in
terms
of
both
style
and
alcohol
percentage
of
course
experimentation
doesnt
always
yield
incredible
results
beyond
is
a
braggot
a
style
of
beer
notsooften
brewed
that
incorporates
large
quantities
of
honey
or
beer
blended
with
mead
and
spices
in
beyond
both
aromatically
and
in
flavor
the
honey
seems
to
be
almost
entirely
fermented
out
leaving
little
little
more
than
a
lipsmacking
sweetness
behind
to
coexist
with
the
large
malt
bill
the
combination
of
the
two
isnt
breathtaking
but
its
certainly
not
awful
either
it
could
use
some
time
for
the
alcohol
to
mellow
i
think
that
time
would
do
this
beer
some
justice
at
the
end
of
the
day
beyond
might
be
polarizing
to
most
because
of
its
uniqueness
but
take
a
brief
look
into
what
a
braggot
was
and
possibly
could
be
as
it
often
varies
by
those
who
blend
it
on
site
and
youll
see
sprechers
beyond
is
an
attempt
to
be
pondered
if
not
respected
for
its
dangerous
drinkability
well
worth
drinking
and
something
id
recommend
to
others
overall
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
a
sprecher
beer
this
is
actually
pretty
good
for
the
style
though
ive
only
had
kuhnhenns
take
its
up
there
with
kuhnhenns
version
which
was
boozier
and
just
as
interesting
review
from

notes
poured
into
a

flute
glass
pours
a

malt
aroma
medium
bodied
with
sweet

light

flavorful
and
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
hopped
beers
i
will
definitely
buy
again
d
its
a

bad
corked

good

braggot
warming
pricey
at

for
a
750ml
bottle
from
tullys

wine
wells
me
the
aroma
has
honey
ginger
spice
brown
sugar
malt
grains
grass
and
earth
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
paper
like
taste
in
the
finish
the
palate
is
nice
overall
its
only
ok
i
love
the
style
but
this
just
doesnt
wow
me
complex
and
tasty
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
from
the
brew
works
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
beautiful
golden
yellow
color
the
head
and
lacing
dont
really
hold
up
all
that
well
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
very
interesting
i
founf
it
to
be
very
inviting
the
taste
is
wonderful
in
my
opinion
i
love
the
honey
flavors
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
thick
enough
to
coat
the
mouth
really
well
but
remain
drinkable
this
beer
overall
in
my
opinion
is
great
i
loved
every
drop
of
it
i
had
i
found
myself
going
back
for
seconds
and
thirds
of
it
on
several
occasions
id
love
to
see
them
make
this
one
again
if
not
ill
be
satisfied
knowing
that
i
got
some
while
it
was
available
this
was
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
decent
sipping
beer
but
it
is
one
that
should
be
enjoyed
in
very
small
quantites
drinking
this
with
a
pasta
meal
was
a
big
mistake
on
my
part
clash
of
the
titans
poured
a
medium
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
aromas
of
honey
alcohol
and
some
citrus
i
noted
orange
creamsicle
tastes
of
the
same
honey
sweetness
with
a
lighter
citrus
medium
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
not
14
i
usually
am
not
too
crazy
about
braggotsmeads
but
found
this
one
to
be
somewhat
enjoyable
tastes
much
lighter
than
its
stated
7
abv
out
on
a
limb
in
an
oldschool
way
i
like
it
overall
it
was
an
ok
dessert
beer
but
not
anything
i
would
search
out
id
put
it
closer
to
a
3
5
overall
with
the
taste
and
feel
improving
to
3
5
for
both
well
as
so
many
trinity
beers
are
this
is
an
awfully
strange
one
modeled
after
the
hot
drink
ive
heard
they
even
serve
this
one
warm
from
time
to
time
down
at
the
brewery
its
got
tea
and
ginger
and
citrus
and
honey
all
coming
alive
in
it
something
like
half
the
fermentables
here
in
fact
come
from
the
honey
yeasty
amber
liquid
with
a
short
off
white
head
gives
way
to
aromas
of
raw
honey
wax
and
all
and
spice
lead
by
clove
and
ginger
but
even
with
some
black
pepper
it
seems
i
taste
the
honey
and
the
tea
first
a
healthy
thing
with
orange
peel
and
black
tea
earthiness
so
much
alcohol
in
the
beer
and
indeed
the
cocktail
but
its
really
not
all
that
evident
in
the
beer
which
i
like
theres
enough
going
on
without
a
huge
booze
thing
too
spices
linger
with
the
heat
of
the
ginger
in
a
long
finish
and
it
does
in
fact
have
a
slight
hop
bitterness
as
it
winds
down
clever
and
unique
to
say
the
least
maybe
a
bit
light
in
carbonation
but
this
is
a
well
made
and
high
headed
beer
all
the
way
around
will
it
age
well
i
wonder
a
little
bit
of
cheese
and
honey
bottle
poured
a
dark
yellow
color
liquid
with
no
carbonation
aroma
of
sweet
grain
with
alcohol
notes
very
discernible
taste
is
heavier
on
alcohol
then
i
would
have
expected
with
some
grain
notes
and
loads
of
honey
notes
body
is
full
with
no
carbonation
different
and
an
interesting
experience
though
too
much
alcohol
is
discernible
not
something
i
would
have
regularly
though
interesting
to
taste
edit
i
put
a
drop
of
this
in
a
fresh
oyster
i
sometimes
put
a
drop
of
wine
it
was
a
terrible
idea
brought
out
the
worst
in
both
bottle
from
the
breweryserved
in
a
small
acero
glass
honeyish
colour
no
headno
carbonation
attractive
honey
aromas
it
smells
like
a
braggot
both
honey
and
licorice
are
very
sweet
and
expected
it
to
be
more
sweet
than
it
was
there
was
the
element
of
licorice
spice
not
very
drinkable
but
i
agree
it
goes
with
food
crackers
helped
odd
bitterness
not
tremendous
for
the
style
overall
i
have
no
personal
reference
for
this
style
as
ive
never
had
it
before
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
a
bit
like
utopias
in
the
sense
that
this
is
not
your
traditional
beer
the
cost
though
22
will
prevent
me
from
buying
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
for
special
occasions
it
fits
the
bill
poured
into
a
pint
glass
o
this
is
my
first
braggot
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
it
was
interesting
and
very
easy
drinking
pretty
nice
stuff
poured
with
a
huge
off
white
foamy
fluffy
thick
head
that
lasts
a
very
long
time
and
very
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
medium
amber
aroma
is
spicey
wine
honey
flavor
is
somewhat
crisp
sweettart
with
great
tang
great
body
and
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
so
pleasing
nice
to
find
another
braggot
there
arent
that
many
of
them
out
there
this
one
pours
golden
with
little
head
which
is
ok
given
the
style
this
is
styled
after
a
traditional
kolsch
but
with
honey
their
version
of
a
medieval
braggot
smells
of
citrusy
honey
and
some
spice
prevalantly
ginger
a
bit
herbal
as
well
the
taste
is
somewhat
subtle
but
pretty
nice
a
little
watery
and
seltzery
but
with
nice
notes
of
orange
flower
water
some
honeyed
notes
and
a
spritz
of
lemon
not
overly
sweet
and
quite
light
a
different
take
on
the
style
and
enjoyable
enough
not
a
style
i
am
overly
familiar
with
but
apart
from
the
mouthfeel
i
think
that
it
is
decent
for
the
style
overall
a
nice
beer
in
a
style
im
not
overly
familiar
with
worth
some
effort
to
try
jd
drinkability
is
ok
its
a
drinkable
braggot
but
man
its
pretty
basic
with
not
much
going
on
i
finished
it
but
probably
wouldnt
revisit
either
d
this
could
easily
become
one
of
my
crack
open
a
cold
one
brews
on
a
friday
night
with
my
friends
when
i
wouldnt
just
crack
open
one
of
my
best
ales
i
think
it
is
a
real
winner
for
nearly
any
occasion
overall
not
bad
but
not
something
to
boast
about
i
mainly
bought
it
for
the
cool
looking
bottle
d
maybe
not
the
traditional
braggot
i
think
made
today
but
a
nice
hybrid
here
4
99
for
the
bottle
is
a
bit
too
much
though
but
it
was
nice
to
try
this
is
ok
but
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
a
little
to
flowery
for
my
tastes
drinkability
not
what
i
expected
but
worth
a
shot
an
interesting
and
refreshing
light
bodied
beer
that
can
be
quaffed
until
the
cows
come
home
definitely
worth
trying
for
a
change
of
pace
low
c
overall
i
liked
it
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
the
honey
wine
or
mead
used
seems
to
be
high
quality
the
ginger
is
essential
for
balance
if
you
can
drink
a
moscato
this
will
be
no
problem
this
is
sweet
this
is
a
honey
bomb
but
it
is
manageable
not
the
best
braggot
ive
had
but
certainly
interesting
if
sweet
is
your
thing
tallyho
if
not
dont
even
look
at
the
bottle
good
beer
or
whatever
this
is
a
very
tasty
sweet
brew
definitely
different
and
should
be
enjoyed
with
dessert
originally
reviewed
09132011
o
a
new
style
that
i
had
not
ever
had
nor
reviewed
before
today
very
interesting
with
the
mixture
of
the
honeymeadlike
flavor
and
the
spices
glad
that
i
tried
it
but
not
sure
that
i
would
describe
it
as
easy
to
drink
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
again
along
with
some
others
in
the
style
in
the
future
not
something
that
i
be
able
to
have
multiple
of
these
in
a
single
session
o
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
of
this
beer
which
makes
it
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
it
is
probably
better
sipped
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
an
entire
bottle
of
this
so
it
is
probably
better
shared
with
friends
overall
the
beer
aspect
of
this
braggot
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
honey
and
spice
character
this
would
be
a
really
nice
offering
around
the
holidays
with
the
cinnamon
and
bready
quality
d
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
aroma
but
otherwise
this
is
a
solid
braggot
would
probably
pair
nicely
with
christmas
cake
but
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
these
flavors
ill
still
to
my
kuhnhenn
braggots
in
the
future
mnot
sure
how
much
of
this
one
i
can
drink
but
good
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
tan
colored
head
the
head
has
a
light
retention
to
it
leaving
a
touch
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
boozy
but
has
a
sweet
malt
and
honey
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
sweet
flavor
very
smooth
and
had
just
a
hint
of
spice
to
it
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
nice
smooth
texture
to
it
overall
i
found
this
brew
to
be
quite
nice
highly
enjoyable
as
the
brew
warmed
up
having
a
difficult
time
deciding
how
to
rate
this
since
ive
so
little
experience
with
these
beers
poured
with
a
small
fine
light
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
cherry
amber
aroma
is
malt
honey
ginger
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
quite
sweet
with
slight
carbonic
tang
to
cut
and
balance
the
imposing
sweetness
body
is
im
thinking
what
it
should
be
and
carbonation
is
ok
finish
is
like
flavor
tapering
to
faintly
ginger
tinted
honey
of
good
length
not
bad
good
dessert
beer
overall
a
unique
beer
my
first
braggot
so
i
lack
a
sample
base
but
in
terms
of
general
enjoyment
i
feel
its
firmly
in
the
4
realm
and
while
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
it
probably
wont
be
a
repurchase
especially
at
this
price
point
nearly
20
00
poured
a
dark
orangeamber
with
a
creamy
white
head
huge
aromas
of
honeysweet
malt
spicy
ginger
and
a
touch
of
oxidation
really
phenomenal
nose
the
ginger
is
amazing
too
bad
the
good
vibrations
from
the
nose
dont
carry
into
the
taste
just
a
cloyingly
sweet
mess
of
honey
malt
and
ginger
like
a
poorlymade
ginger
mead
at
this
point
im
sad
to
say
mouthfeel
is
big
and
sticky
with
a
full
body
and
low
carbonation
overall
i
think
this
may
have
been
good
at
one
point
but
its
a
sweet
mess
now
other
comments
yikes
this
was
not
really
worth
the
space
it
took
up
in
my
suitcase
too
sweet
and
heavy
my
first
braggot
so
i
dont
really
know
how
to
compare
it
ill
assume
its
good
443
544
considering
the
style
and
what
this
is
exactly
id
say
this
is
rather
drinkable
however
with
the
formidable
alcohol
and
nearly
obscene
sweetness
this
is
certainly
something
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
in
moderation
mfd
thinner
body
than
i
expected
doesnt
have
the
mouth
coating
richness
i
for
some
reason
assumed
it
would
have
but
still
very
nice
overall
this
a
really
good
and
interesting
beer
its
my
first
braggot
so
cant
say
how
it
compares
to
style
but
if
its
a
good
representation
than
im
going
to
have
to
find
some
more
mead
styles
only
wish
is
that
the
ginger
was
less
dominant
i
love
it
in
foods
but
not
in
drinks
for
some
reason
high
recommendation
on
this
one
rotation
web
order
its
pricey
and
hard
to
get
so
this
may
be
my
only
one
of
it
would
definitely
try
on
tap
also
would
be
more
likely
to
buy
if
it
was
in
12oz
format
at
this
abv
and
price
the
750ml
is
too
much
drinkability
reminds
me
of
hard
christmas
candy
oh
yeah
i
like
this
and
would
pick
it
up
again
in
a
heartbeat
despite
the
hefty
price
one
for
the
cold
temps
but
this
is
a
fine
pick
to
celebrate
the
15th
anniversary
for
me
and
my
bride
cheers
honey
d
this
is
a
delicious
beverage
and
one
ive
greatly
enjoyed
quite
easy
to
drink
for
its
weight
i
probably
drank
the
750
in
about
an
hour
at
most
expensive
but
a
must
for
any
fan
of
mead
or
the
middle
ages
m
d
if
it
were
any
bigger
in
body
it
would
take
an
already
intense
drink
well
over
the
top
and
make
it
both
incredibly
cloying
and
a
real
struggle
to
finish
id
still
describe
it
as
being
mediumbodied
though
it
is
riding
a
very
fine
line
to
being
fullbodied
it
would
help
to
have
some
better
descriptive
phrases
for
mouthfeel
i
suppose
theres
a
slight
viscosity
to
it
which
makes
sense
but
it
doesnt
come
across
as
being
as
heavy
in
body
as
some
of
the
more
sizable
russian
imperial
stouts
or
barleywines
its
more
slippery
while
otherwise
having
some
fairly
competitive
fullness
to
it
most
certainly
a
sipping
brew
and
one
that
can
certainly
be
appreciated
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
a
couple
even
it
performs
well
both
straight
out
of
the
fridge
and
after
a
little
time
to
breathe
in
which
time
it
really
just
opens
itself
up
and
lets
loose
like
that
friend
that
has
a
tendency
to
overshare
it
works
out
alright
in
the
end
strangely
kinda
like
that
friend
and
can
make
for
a
very
rewarding
bottle
to
enjoy
d
upon
my
first
whiff
after
popping
the
cork
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
sickly
sweet
mess
much
like
some
meads
ive
had
thankfully
the
carbonation
alleviates
this
issue
and
the
sweetness
is
kept
in
check
very
nicely
ive
gone
through
almost
the
entire
500ml
over
the
course
of
this
review
and
hardly
noticed
i
dont
know
that
this
is
anything
id
ever
purchase
again
aside
from
occassional
novelty
or
curiosity
but
its
definitely
a
welldeserved
experience
two
bad
a
half
liter
of
this
stuff
costs
15
the
first
braggot
ive
ever
had
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
into
a
duvel
snifter
pours
a
hazy
bubbly
dark
orange
with
a
decent
khaki
head
aroma
is
an
intriguing
blend
of
brown
malts
honey
and
slight
spice
with
just
a
slight
trace
of
hops
the
taste
is
an
absolutely
breathtaking
blend
of
sweet
fruits
honey
slight
brown
malts
spices
and
traces
of
ginger
brown
sugar
and
caramel
incredibly
complex
the
beer
is
certainly
on
the
heavy
side
with
a
decent
amount
of
boozy
alcohol
but
nothing
too
overbearing
this
one
is
certainly
a
sipper
especially
on
a
hot
late
spring
night
but
it
is
enjoyable
d
drinkability
was
good
in
limited
proportions
a
bomber
will
surfice
here
very
boozy
at
10
0abv
and
sweet
from
the
honeywine
of
course
limits
multiples
a
rare
style
but
a
very
good
showing
at
that
has
that
old
world
feel
to
it
and
will
definitely
warm
you
on
that
cold
winter
day
a
spoton
example
of
a
braggot
malty
with
honey
and
spicing
beermeade
mix
sweet
but
balanced
very
easy
to
drink
for
abv
a
strong
beer
with
out
all
the
work
a
nice
one
to
along
with
a
spicy
meal
maybe
its
what
this
style
is
supposed
to
be
i
dont
know
but
this
was
too
heavy
and
syrupy
for
me
kuhnhenns
braggot
is
a
nice
blend
of
malty
ale
and
mead
a
sweet
enjoyable
departure
from
my
typical
routine
and
well
worth
a
try
for
anyone
that
may
be
curious
o
i
havent
had
many
other
braggots
to
compare
this
to
but
while
i
wasnt
blown
away
i
thought
this
was
pretty
solid
has
a
nice
malty
sweetness
to
it
and
you
can
detect
the
booze
but
it
drinks
a
lot
easier
then
you
would
expect
it
to
this
braggot
is
exceptional
imho
as
brewmaster
todd
schwem
found
the
perfect
balance
with
this
beer
mead
i
am
not
a
fan
of
honey
flavored
meads
or
honey
in
general
so
this
braggot
surprised
me
i
call
it
lightly
sweet
with
a
nice
effervescence
and
an
earthy
undertonemust
be
the
beer
portion
and
a
fresh
baked
shortbread
like
character
gosh
just
a
nice
quaff
very
impressed
with
this
the
history
of
braggot
dates
back
centuries
in
northern
europe
braggots
are
meads
made
with
malted
barley
in
addition
to
the
honey
our
braggot
won
a
bronze
medal
at
the
2012
great
american
beer
festival
brewed
with
wildflower
honey
and
rich
dark
specialty
malts
the
final
product
is
akin
to
a
scottish
ale
with
an
added
earthy
depth
and
sweetness
vinous
notes
combine
with
earthy
flavors
and
a
touch
of
toffee
and
biscuit
character
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
this
is
a
complex
sipper
sure
to
warm
even
the
coldest
nights
had
higher
expectations
for
this
id
say
better
than
ok
but
not
great
overall
this
beer
is
wildly
rich
and
decadent
the
nose
alone
could
cause
diabetes
with
warmth
the
booze
does
come
out
in
droves
to
meet
the
horrible
sweetness
giving
a
semblance
of
a
balance
to
the
tasting
as
far
as
a
braggot
goes
this
tastes
more
mead
than
beer
with
a
strong
showing
of
the
raisins
figs
and
fruity
undertones
held
within
rather
than
with
much
depth
of
grain
or
bitterness
of
hops
this
beer
is
one
quick
step
away
from
being
an
amazing
barrel
aged
beer
as
it
has
enough
intrinsic
diacetyls
and
buttery
warmth
to
carry
it
that
might
make
it
more
approachable
and
acceptable
by
many
professional
whale
hunters
but
alternatively
could
push
it
even
further
into
uncharted
extreme
territories
o
its
a
sipper
it
is
better
at
room
temperature
it
just
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
english
barleywine
it
has
warming
effects
i
like
it
flopjack
out
tight
lines
overall
havent
had
much
of
this
style
but
this
was
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
wonder
what
the
2
years
of
age
did
to
this
as
the
alcohol
was
very
subdued
and
overall
this
was
a
lot
more
balanced
and
sweet
than
i
expected
will
buy
again
if
i
see
it
c
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
for
the
price
tag
if
you
like
braggots
you
should
really
pick
this
up
just
to
try
it
once
the
mouth
feel
is
pretty
dense
and
heavy
though
the
braggot
is
carbonated
pretty
well
slightly
sticky
wet
and
oily
with
a
warm
and
sharp
finish
the
aftertaste
is
full
of
booze
light
citrus
yeast
and
malty
sweetness
overall
i
enjoyed
the
brew
quite
a
bit
though
it
may
be
too
heavy
to
drink
regularly
the
drastically
high
alcohol
content
was
fairly
tame
it
was
interesting
to
pick
out
the
traditional
flavors
of
kuhnhenns
citrus
mead
here
i
wonder
what
beer
was
mixed
in
with
this
batch
12
ounce
bottle
into
signature
tulip
glass
winter
solstice
2011
bottling
pours
very
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
foamy
light
khaki
head
with
poor
retention
that
reduces
to
nothing
as
expected
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
big
caramel
toast
molasses
toffee
chocolate
raisin
prune
honey
biscuit
tobacco
light
nuttiness
floral
and
dark
earthiness
damn
nice
aromas
with
great
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
and
honey
notes
with
hardly
any
alcohol
presence
taste
of
big
caramel
toast
toffee
molasses
honey
raisin
prune
biscuit
tobacco
leather
light
nuttiness
floral
herbal
and
dark
earthiness
lingering
notes
of
caramel
toast
toffee
dark
fruit
molasses
honey
biscuit
tobacco
leather
and
dark
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
while
fantastic
complexity
and
balance
of
malt
flavors
with
honey
with
hardly
any
cloying
sweetness
present
after
the
finish
light
carbonation
and
very
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
slick
and
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
for
16
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
definitely
a
slow
sipper
though
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
braggot
style
incredible
complexity
and
balance
of
malthoney
flavors
and
insanely
smooth
to
sip
on
for
being
16
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
this
is
my
first
braggot
but
it
seems
to
fit
the
description
of
the
style
very
well
it
was
definitely
a
tasty
and
unique
experience
and
was
very
drinkable
given
the
high
abv
it
seems
like
theyre
pretty
tough
to
come
by
but
id
like
to
try
some
more
examples
of
this
style
overall
the
style
doesnt
lend
itself
to
much
complexity
in
my
experience
the
honey
flavors
mask
most
of
the
dimensions
of
the
beer
amazingly
smooth
though
well
this
is
my
first
braggot
and
it
wont
be
my
last
assuming
i
can
actually
find
someone
else
who
makes
on
that
i
can
get
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
american
braggots
ive
had
the
honey
aroma
and
flavor
is
deep
and
satisfying
and
the
alcohol
is
incredibly
wellhidden
o
color
me
impressed
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
braggots
in
the
future
overall
interesting
unique
a
big
beer
with
lots
of
dark
fruits
malts
syrupy
candy
flavors
and
plenty
of
additions
from
the
booze
itself
however
the
mead
portion
seems
to
be
drowned
out
a
bit
too
much
but
still
tasty
and
good
though
im
very
new
to
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
o
another
one
of
those
for
me
at
least
never
having
had
mead
or
a
braggot
before
really
unique
beers
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
drinking
of
it
it
was
so
innocuous
and
easydrinking
but
at
the
same
time
i
probably
would
go
with
a
barleywine
just
as
easily
dont
get
me
wrong
though
if
you
are
a
true
beer
advocate
it
is
worth
the
buy
cheers
it
is
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
but
maybe
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
kuhnenns
always
pleases
in
some
fashion
from
the
2011
winter
solstice
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
according
to
the
bottle
this
checks
in
at
a
whopping
16
abv
it
is
a
deep
dark
brownish
color
slightly
translucent
with
little
to
no
carbonation
smell
is
extremely
sweet
and
alcoholic
with
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
and
molassestype
aromas
taste
is
very
sweet
with
an
interesting
mix
of
woody
offflavors
while
alcohol
is
definitely
present
it
is
hidden
pretty
well
for
16
abv
there
is
very
little
carbonation
here
this
is
probably
my
first
braggot
but
despite
not
having
anything
to
compare
to
this
is
an
enjoyable
heavy
beer
o
a
nice
sipping
beer
and
at
16
thats
all
id
recommend
you
do
with
it
very
unique
and
complex
on
the
palate
extremely
deep
and
really
lingers
on
the
palate
for
a
long
time
kuhnhenn
continues
to
impress
with
their
huge
beers
that
carry
a
nice
flavor
and
are
beyond
drinkable
with
hidden
booze
careful
though
you
can
barely
taste
the
16
abv
even
at
room
temperature
literally
zero
bite
and
only
very
mild
alcoholic
warmth
as
it
descends
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
at
12
for
a
12oz
its
only
for
special
occasions

i
believe
this
is
the
march

vintage

dark
amber
with
a
diminutive
head
of
bubbles
the
nose
is
earthy
with
notes

sour

heather

the
flavor
is
earthy
and
slightly
sour
with
notes
of
heather
honey
and
a
dash
of
chocolate
this
was
cloying
and
i
didnt
finish
my
small
sample
wow
a
winter
solstice
08
beer
that
isnt
infected
i
should
go
buy
a
lottery
ticket
i
was
definitely
expecting
a
bit
more
body
with
this
one
and
the
sourness
was
slightly
offputting
though
it
wasnt
enough
to
ruin
the
beer
for
me
d
its
unseasonably
cool
right
now
but
this
is
definitely
a
winter
brew
abv
is
big
time
but
would
make
a
nice
warming
sipper
during
the
cold

a
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
is
intense
as
i
have
come
to
expect
from
kuhnhenn
big
tangy
bitterness
with
lots
of
oaky
tannins
honey
is
sweet
almost
overwhelming
but
the
high
alcohol
and
malty
base
manage
to
reign
it
in
full
bodied
definitely
approaching
syrupy
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
hoohah
kuhnhenn
makes
some
big
ass
beers
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
red
almost
brown
away
from
the
light
thin
tan
head
forms
settles
to
a
nice
collar
around
the
glass
some
lacing
sticks
looks
pretty
nice
smell
is
neat
very
floral
caramel
fruit
raisins
alcohol
light
ammonia
which
i
noticed
with
the
braggot
i
made
biscuits
lots
of
malt
neat
honey
character
taste
is
neat
although
the
flavour
it
a
bit
thin
and
hot
some
floral
honey
character
fruity
alcohol
is
in
your
face
some
caramel
apples
some
spice
ammonia
again
pretty
interesting
although
cant
say
its
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
pretty
thin
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
some
big
heat
going
down
way
too
thin
light
sourness
lots
of
heat
not
as
rich
and
full
bodied
as
i
think
a
braggot
should
be
style
i
have
ever
had
top
notch
and
i
would
go
for
it
again
got
this
one
at
the
kuhnhenn
solstice
party
08
clear
deep
chestnut
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thin
layer
of
fine
beige
bubbles
there
was
a
thin
collar
too
which
provided
some
spotty
lacing
caramel
and
floral
honey
in
the
aroma
along
with
unrefined
sugar
mild
dark
and
toasted
grains
and
a
hint
of
higher
alcohols
low
bitterness
plenty
of
sugary
sweetness
some
caramel
and
quite
a
lot
of
honey
flavour
a
bit
of
fruit
character
as
well
plum
and
cherry
mild
alcohol
flavour
with
moderate
warmth
very
fine
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
low
side
with
medium
body
quite
smooth
quite
tasty
and
very
drinkable
a
nice
change
of
pace
when
youre
looking
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
braggots
a
good
beer
kuhnhenn
did
a
nice
job
with
this
interesting
style
this
is
my
first
go
with
a
braggot
and
im
pretty
impressed
as
i
alluded
to
earlier
its
very
artful
and
classy
i
feel
important
as
im
drinking
dammit
a
beer
that
makes
you
feel
important
is
a
good
beer
thanks
derek
very
thoughtful
selection
d
the
alcohol
will
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
with
this
one
a
easy
to
drink
sipper
interesting
and
unique
poured
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
small
sized
head
aromas
of
well
guess
what
honey
with
some
caramel
tastes
of
honey
caramel
and
some
breadiness
light
alcohol
in
the
finish
braggots
are
another
style
i
dont
really
seek
out
but
this
one
was
drinkable
and
not
bad
very
nice
refreshing
semidry
mead
the
malt
does
very
well
at
helping
any
cloying
sweetness
that
may
have
been
there
alcohol
burns
slightly
in
the
chest
floral
earthy
finish
again
full
of
alcohol
once
past
the
initial
alcohol
burn
the
spritzy
carbonation
really
helps
drinkability
nice
sipper
after
a
long
weekend
of
liver
infection
braggot
is
very
drinkable
and
went
well
cars
water
cracker
and
brie
a
sparkling
mead
with
geuzelike
sourness
my
first
braggot
it
was
crisp
carbonated
wohlfs
who
brought
it
to
doug
shoemaker
explained
the
carbonation
is
from
the
malt
and
different
dry
aftertaste
refreshing
and
will
have
again
surprising
the
alcohol
was
so
high
ya
dont
notice
golden
brown
something
of
the
copperish
color
of
a
lightly
toasted
marshmellow
nothing
too
significant
in
the
way
of
carbonation
a
very
strong
sweet
honey
aroma
drifted
from
the
bottle
right
away
very
potent
big
big
flavor
dominated
by
alcohol
and
honey
sweetness
in
the
truest
sense
a
beefier
middle
that
ressembles
beer
a
little
more
probably
where
the
barley
in
the
product
shows
itself
a
bit
alcohol
in
the
finish
especially
as
it
warms
a
bit
it
gets
a
bit
harsh
when
its
really
warm
but
otherwise
it
was
pretty
good
im
not
sure
of
the
abv
but
if
its
below
78abv
id
be
outright
shocked
pours
out
to
a
thick
beige
head
and
minimal
lacing
but
good
retention
color
is
a
hazy
deep
copper
aroma
is
esters
honey
sweet
vanilla
and
floral
flavor
is
strong
on
honey
and
vanilla
and
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
full
and
thick
overall
a
great
braggot
quite
a
good
braggot
a
nice
strong
honey
flavor
combined
with
a
nice
bitter
hoppiness
its
not
a
light
sweet
honey
either
but
a
good
dark
flavorful
honey
the
whole
thing
is
deepened
and
rounded
by
aging
in
spirit
barrels
quite
flavorful
not
too
sweet
and
a
lovely
almost
vinous
aroma
very
satisfying
doubly
so
to
share
a
bottle
with
my
wife
for
mardi
gras
o
its
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
bayou
teche
so
far
its
unique
refreshing
and
gives
me
the
whiskey
flavor
i
like
this
is
my
first
braggot
not
much
carbonation
on
the
pour
but
it
is
a
beautiful
dark
ruby
red
color
it
is
translucent
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
just
a
ring
of
foam
around
the
edge
the
smell
is
sweet
but
not
like
those
artificially
sweetened
beers
a
strong
honey
scent
dominates
this
beer
the
whiskey
barrel
is
not
so
prominent
but
still
present
and
balances
the
honey
very
well
slick
but
not
sticky
on
the
palate
and
again
not
too
much
carbonation
but
it
works
well
i
usually
dont
like
lightly
carbonated
beers
but
this
one
is
the
exception
the
taste
is
almost
the
same
as
the
smell
but
with
a
little
more
of
the
whiskey
barrel
shining
through
this
beer
was
one
of
my
favorites
if
not
my
favorite
from
bayou
teche
so
far
i
will
definitely
get
another
bottle
to
save
and
one
to
send
as
an
extra
on
a
future
trade
highly
recommended
sweet
smelling
noticeable
honey
but
not
too
sweet
which
is
a
plus
the
whiskey
barrel
is
mild
but
strong
at
the
same
time
hard
to
explain
but
its
less
whiskey
barrel
but
more
whiskey
and
i
cant
shake
the
idea
that
the
whiskey
smells
cheap
same
thing
translates
into
the
taste
really
not
syrupy
a
solid
medium
body
and
good
feel
aside
from
the
sometimes
strong
spirit
notes
the
fermented
alcohol
is
fairy
well
hidden
mostly
in
the
taste
its
unique
refreshingly
not
cloying
i
think
ill
get
another
bottle
to
age
this
might
be
a
much
better
beer
a
year
or
more
down
the
line
very
unique
lots
of
ginger
lots
of
honey
unlike
anything
youll
try
this
libation
has
a
cult
following
if
you
can
get
some
you
shouldnt
pass
it
up
real
flavors
save
it
from
a
very
bare
bottom
rate
but
just
way
too
much
of
everything
this
is
cave
creek
chili
dixie
white
moose
level
dare
stuff
insert
kicking
rad
pipe
organ
solo
here
flavor
is
much
more
beer
like
honey
lends
a
thinner
body
the
roll
of
flavors
at
the
end
is
really
impressive
starts
mild
and
finishes
spiceysweetboozypineycitrusy
leave
a
very
wine
like
aftersip
mouthfeel
everyone
else
loves
it
i
think
its
kinda
weird
but
interesting
to
call
this
a
braggot
its
a
drink
enjoy
cheers
looked
like
no
head
at
all
would
appear
then
it
gurgled
up
about
116
of
foam
for
about
15
seconds
and
disappeared
looks
like
iced
tea
theres
a
few
bubbles
but
otherwise
it
tastes
flat
smell
is
remotely
beerlike
more
like
cider
actually
taste
id
call
a
tainted
apple
cider
kind
of
an
unsweetened
apple
with
a
hint
of
ginger
frankly
i
question
whether
this
even
should
count
as
beer
if
you
gave
a
nonbeeradvocate
an
unlabelled
glass
of
this
i
think
theyd
take
a
few
sips
and
ask
whered
you
get
the
lame
juice
d
the
spice
here
reminds
me
of
a
ginger
pale
tried
a
while
back
from
was
trade
routelaughing
buddha
but
the
exotic
spice
plays
in
a
more
interesting
way
here
muddled
with
apples
and
honey
certainly
a
malty
brew
and
one
to
be
reckoned
with
for
its
conniving
booziness
but
ultimately
one
im
happy
to
have
tried
and
would
seek
for
a
second
taste
i
really
enjoyed
slippery
slope
from
the
peoples
pint
ive
enjoyed
all
of
their
offerings
ive
tried
now
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
bottle
a
month
though
its
more
of
a
special
occasion
thing
f
dries
off
quite
a
bit
with
the
help
of
the
fermented
honey
lingering
spices
and
ginger
just
dominate
the
finish
for
a
long
time
some
spiciness
and
the
booze
makes
my
tongue
feel
like
i
just
used
mouthwash
for
5
minutes
a
bitterness
that
comes
from
the
ginger
i
think
might
be
nice
to
have
with
sushi
but
otherwise
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
9
abv
is
quite
well
hidden
i
split
a
bomber
with
a
friend
and
so
wasnt
too
wobbly
afterwards
if
youre
attacking
this
beer
solo
drink
slowly
even
though
youll
want
to
suck
it
back
like
soda
otherwise
you
might
be
a
little
weebly
afterwards
i
enjoyed
it
once
but
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
the
beer
is
a
hybrid
of
sorts
according
to
the
brewer
who
was
pouring
at
the
menotomy
beer
tasting
in
arlington
ma
this
past
sunday
the
beer
has
a
definite
honeyed
sweetness
a
slight
vinous
quality
lots
of
ginger
but
it
isnt
over
the
top
the
beer
has
a
bit
of
apple
cider
and
maybe
a
touch
of
barley
wine
combine
these
elements
and
you
have
the
slippery
slope
braggot
there
is
a
slight
spritzy
flavor
maybe
a
touch
of
lemon
in
the
body
but
im
convinced
that
the
slight
acerbicness
of
lemon
is
more
the
interplay
of
the
honey
and
the
ginger
the
beer
is
fairly
light
on
the
tongue
and
has
a
very
modest
aftertaste
this
is
a
change
up
type
of
beer
and
not
one
i
would
visit
with
any
regularity
consumed
on
1162009
with
largadeer
and
dyan
largadeer
grew
tired
of
small
talk
so
he
popped
the
cap
and
downed
numerous
gulps
of
this
braggot
when
he
removed
the
bottle
from
his
mouth
foam
shot
out
of
his
mouth
his
nose
and
the
bottle
its
safe
to
say
the
beer
was
very
carbonated
masterful
opening
it
appears
dark
orange
with
a
2
finger
head
the
nose
is
ginger
ginger
ginger
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
ginger
cider
with
nose
of
granny
smith
apples
and
a
bit
of
honey
the
flavor
is
sweet
honey
segueing
into
an
aggressive
blast
of
spicy
ginger
palate
abuse
eh
too
much
ginger
and
way
too
much
carbonation
pours
a
clear
goldenamber
with
a
huge
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
this
was
explosively
carbonated
making
it
less
than
ideal
to
chug
from
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
a
horrendously
sweet
blend
of
ginger
honey
and
pale
malt
the
taste
unsurprisingly
is
also
disgustingly
sweet
and
cloying
spicy
ginger
backed
by
honey
apples
and
sweet
malt
did
i
mention
that
this
is
sweet
if
not
yeah
this
beer
is
unbelievably
sweet
after
a
night
of
drinking
dry
tannic
gueuze
the
sweetness
of
this
was
intolerable
i
dont
think
ill
be
rushing
out
to
try
more
braggots
after
this
decent
body
low
carbonation
and
a
decent
finish
this
isnt
particularly
memorable
drinkability
forget
about
it
i
could
drink
maybe
a
couple
of
oz
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
the
drinkability
is
fine
considering
i
didnt
much
for
the
beer
as
a
whole
its
a
different
braggot
but
one
that
just
didnt
sit
too
well
with
me
a
very
interesting
beer
i
liked
it
for
the
most
part
however
i
feel
like
the
ginger
overwhelms
the
more
subtle
honey
flavor
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
again
but
interesting
nonetheless
22
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
brewed
with
barley
malt
honey
local
cider
and
fresh
ginger
the
beer
pours
a
clearish
dark
honeyed
hue
with
medium
carboation
and
a
halfinch
of
whitish
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
collar
and
deposits
a
few
wisps
of
lacing
ginger
is
the
first
thing
i
smell
followed
by
hints
of
oranges
with
malts
and
ethanol
in
the
finish
the
honey
and
cider
dont
particularly
stand
out
but
the
flavors
have
melded
very
nicely
ginger
also
leads
off
on
the
palate
but
there
is
also
a
cider
and
yeast
presence
a
light
tanginess
and
a
big
dose
of
warming
alcohol
atop
a
lightly
tingly
medium
body
that
feels
a
bit
powdery
and
imparts
a
medium
finish
the
flavor
is
a
little
thinner
than
id
like
and
it
would
be
better
with
some
sugary
sweetness
but
it
did
become
tastier
and
more
drinkable
as
it
warmed
never
had
a
braggot
before
and
i
feel
the
cider
overpowers
the
honey
but
this
is
a
very
unique
beverage
that
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
had
on
tap
at
the
pint
on
13009
served
in
a
pint
glass
appearance
was
a
translucent
honey
color
with
no
head
nose
was
apples
and
herbal
flavors
consisted
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
chamomile
and
a
light
tart
apple
quality
mouthfeel
was
lightbodied
and
subtly
carbonated
easy
drinking
with
a
wellhidden
abv
this
is
only
my
second
braggot
and
i
was
blown
away
the
first
was
less
than
appealing
despite
the
abv
this
would
make
a
great
summer
offering
in
my
opinion
other
reviews
say
this
is
well
carbonated
but
i
see
none
meduim
mouthfeel
and
alcoholhard
cider
lelemnts
make
this
moderately
easy
to
drink
overall
a
unique
style
and
worth
a
try
as
a
former
local
i
know
the
greenfiled
water
can
be
less
than
clean
and
still
these
guys
can
put
together
really
decent
brews
cheers
d
this
one
kicked
my
ass
kept
taking
sip
after
sip
without
even
thinking
what
a
treat
i
should
have
picked
up
some
more
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
it
is
absolutely
worth
trying
but
it
definitely
wont
appeal
to
everyone
poured
out
with
no
head
a
bit
foggy
apple
ciderish
color
in
appearance
the
smell
is
pretty
fruity
apples
and
grapes
mostly
definitely
some
spice
and
malt
too
thin
flavors
allow
it
to
be
wicked
sweet
extra
tastes
include
a
touch
of
honey
citrus
and
definitely
cider
the
mouthfeel
is
weak
but
this
is
toward
its
benefit
definitely
very
smooth
i
feel
many
might
not
be
sure
about
this
drink
but
i
must
say
this
was
pretty
darn
good
although
i
rated
this
beer
with
the
braggot
style
in
mind
i
did
not
like
it
at
all
of
course
i
dont
like
a
hot
toddy
either
but
my
girlfriend
who
loves
them
also
hated
this
brew
with
that
in
mind
i
wanted
to
convey
this
to
everyone
this
is
a
good
beer
based
on
the
style
but
obviously
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
the
sourness
is
prevalent
in
the
mouthfeel
but
it
leaves
a
sort
of
dry
coat
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
it
has
a
smooth
follow
through
making
it
one
of
the
easier
9
8
abvs
to
take
down
pours
a
murky
rustic
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
ring
of
fluffy
bubbles
around
the
entire
glass
some
thin
lacing
left
behind
from
swirling
the
glass
but
not
much
smell
now
this
is
where
it
gets
interesting
sweet
sweet
honey
toasted
cinnamon
apple
cider
white
grapes
ginger
and
spice
although
i
have
nothing
to
compare
this
to
i
still
really
enjoy
the
nose
on
this
one
taste
is
more
honey
and
spice
up
front
with
a
warm
apple
crisp
sweetness
a
faint
yeast
flavor
on
the
tongue
with
more
ginger
and
some
clove
aftertaste
is
a
bit
grassy
with
cinnamon
bark
as
well
mouthfeel
is
pretty
wet
at
first
but
dries
out
towards
the
end
medium
body
with
a
full
carbonation
i
really
wouldnt
expect
the
9
8
abv
if
i
didnt
know
beforehand
its
hidden
quite
well
what
an
interesting
style
i
could
definitely
see
myself
having
a
beer
like
this
on
a
special
occasions
or
during
the
fallwinter
holidays
thanks
tom
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
unique
brew
i
hope
you
and
your
wife
enjoy
the
flower
power
md
the
addition
of
the
cider
lends
a
certain
smoothness
to
a
sharp
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
with
a
highish
abv
is
definitely
a
slippery
slope
the
only
detractor
is
there
is
a
bit
too
much
ginger
but
still
very
impressive
a
great
first
impression
for
this
style
for
me
dangerously
drinkable
especially
if
you
like
ginger
peoples
pint
knows
what
winter
is
all
about
this
one
gets
a
hell
yeah
poured
cloudy
honeyorange
colored
with
some
light
foamy
head
nose
is
spicy
and
you
can
tell
its
tangy
as
well
taste
is
like
apple
cider
without
the
appliness
but
the
slight
sweetness
definitive
tang
and
some
ginger
dominate
but
i
would
have
expected
some
stronger
flavors
if
youre
expecting
a
different
style
you
will
be
sorely
disappointed
but
i
suppose
that
is
true
about
any
beer
interesting
braggot
just
not
my
style
almost
pours
a
one
finger
white
head
that
goes
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
a
little
lace
low
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
almost
clear
amber
color
nose
is
apple
cider
flavor
is
honey
and
cider
very
smooth
high
abv
is
hidden
hops
in
the
background
nice
beer
but
not
the
usual
braggot
not
enough
body
and
not
as
sweet
6

for
a
22oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
label
has
abv
at
9
8
dnotes
unique
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
regularly
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
no
doubt
good
on
a
crisp
fall
day
alcohol
masked
very
well
995
if
you
enjoy
cysers
or
other
meadlike
beverages
this
is
a
great
entry
for
something
truly
different
in
the
beer
world
this
is
an
awesome
treat
i
could
not
drink
this
regularly
but
its
wonderful
as
a
change
of
pace
from
bjohnson
for
my
bombing
very
refreshing
flavors
right
from
the
start
apple
cider
notes
give
the
beer
a
subtle
but
excellent
sweetness
apple
peel
adds
to
the
body
of
the
cider
notes
leafy
mint
flavors
on
the
tongue
give
create
a
fresh
flavor
that
cleanses
the
palate
cider
notes
are
revived
in
the
aftertaste
leaving
a
starchiness
on
the
palate
with
an
apple
peel
dryness
honey
flavors
are
present
but
are
definitely
undertones
and
play
a
nice
supporting
role
to
the
rest
of
the
notes
toasted
grain
notes
also
play
a
secondary
role
and
are
apparent
in
the
aftertaste
a
pretty
light
bodied
braggot
that
doesnt
sport
a
huge
mouthfeel
thickness
very
nice
and
extremely
drinkable
braggot
with
a
higher
abv
that
goes
completely
unnoticed
get
this
if
you
canits
almost
too
drinkable
wow
we
have
had
a
bottle
of
slippery
slope
in
the
fridge
for
a
while
now
just
waiting
for
a
good
time
to
appreciate
it
and
it
was
worth
the
wait
it
pours
a
very
interesting
colorit
is
almost
rosecolored
and
it
smells
amazing
it
actually
smells
like
a
gingerapple
crisp
that
i
made
last
thanksgivingsweet
but
with
a
little
kick
of
gingeryspice
the
taste
is
really
interestingits
sweet
but
it
has
enough
of
a
kick
to
offer
some
balance
it
also
has
a
bit
of
an
alcoholy
aftertaste
it
has
a
really
unique
tasteits
not
like
the
other
braggots
i
have
tried
i
would
say
that
its
drinkablei
look
forward
to
having
more
drinkability
this
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
interesting
flavor
components
keeps
it
intreaging
for
a
while
definitely
worth
giving
this
a
try
since
it
is
a
unique
style
cloudy
reddish
hazy
pour
with
orange
highlights
no
head
no
lace
pure
murk
boozy
port
nose
infused
with
ginger
body
odor
and
rummy
fruitcake
strangely
reminiscent
of
margaritas
in
the
nose
taste
surpasses
these
obstacles
and
presents
a
buttery
vanilla
bomb
sweet
cream
ice
cream
with
bourbon
sauce
topped
with
the
best
honey
available
to
man
great
dessert
flavor
finishing
tart
in
a
supremely
lactic
fashion
crazy
and
wonderful
a
good
sipper
but
very
drinkable
due
to
the
lack
of
alcohol
sting
or
thick
body
a
bizarre
concoction
for
sure
and
one
with
way
too
many
directions
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
the
peoples
pint
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
broad
kind
of
sticky
actuallyalmost
as
if
the
honey
is
trying
to
coalesce
into
its
usual
form
really
sticks
around
the
inside
of
the
mouth
a
nice
slow
drinking
beer
not
sure
i
could
go
through
this
one
fast
if
i
really
really
tried
it
is
so
rich
taste
develops
and
blossoms
at
it
warms
towards
room
temp
tart
at
first
and
building
to
a
spicy
malt
mélange
sweet
honey
is
present
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
full
tantalizing
brandy
character
lots
of
fruity
complexity
flows
throughout
along
with
alcoholic
warmth
to
bring
you
to
a
land
of
plum
raisin
bruised
apple
and
late
harvest
grapes
very
well
constructed
and
creative
braggot
from
the
peoples
pint
truly
an
interesting
offering
and
one
that
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
of
when
i
was
out
in
greenfield
with
fellow
bas
warriorsoul
paulb
fdrich29
bocktech
and
eveninghawk
this
brew
pours
a
nice
coppery
amber
color
with
a
faint
white
head
leaving
no
lace
smells
were
intially
very
sweet
with
a
nice
honey
aroma
followed
by
some
tart
apples
a
little
spice
and
an
almost
medicinal
clove
like
aroma
initial
flavors
were
almost
mead
like
with
a
sweet
and
spicy
tone
which
was
mainly
from
the
honey
following
a
bit
of
malt
flavor
sneaks
its
way
into
the
picture
but
is
quickly
overrun
by
yet
more
spice
and
a
fruity
zest
like
flavor
the
finish
to
this
brew
is
a
little
herbal
with
just
a
sweet
honey
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
full
of
flavor
while
the
brew
had
a
nice
medium
body
carbonation
was
light
and
faint
overall
this
was
a
decent
braggot
but
a
bit
undrinkable
imho
just
because
it
was
a
bit
sweet
and
overwhelming
at
points
definetly
worth
a
try
though
edit
i
have
upgraded
my
inital
rating
a
bit
as
the
brew
warms
toward
room
temp
the
honey
flavor
and
smoothness
becomes
more
and
more
apparent
since
this
why
i
dinged
it
a
bit
in
a
couple
of
categories
i
felt
the
need
for
an
adjustment
o
really
nice
braggot
easily
the
best
one
ive
had
well
made
and
nicely
done
really
enjoying
this
well
blended
and
really
leaves
pleasant
flavors
in
the
mouth
will
have
to
get
another
d
i
love
braggot
so
i
immediately
ordered
this
beer
when
i
saw
it
ontap
its
nice
that
so
many
local
brewers
are
experimenting
with
honey
beers
more
on
the
beer
side
than
most
of
the
braggots
ive
had
i
love
both
genres
springtime
puts
it
perfectly
hard
to
imagine
drinking
this
at
any
other
time
a
great
beer
for
late
spring
overall
a
good
different
tasting
beer
this
beer
is
2
25
parts
mead
to
one
part
brown
ale
allinall
i
get
a
lot
of
spice
and
fruit
off
of
this
beer
not
at
all
what
im
used
to
but
not
necessarily
bad
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
can
definitely
envision
drinking
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
for
a
bit
of
refreshment
drinkability
is
pretty
good
an
enjoyable
complex
brew
that
definitely
stands
out
from
the
crowd
as
much
as
i
enjoy
the
more
robust
characteristics
they
can
be
dealbreakers
im
sure
for
some
recommended
to
fans
of
belgian
style
beers
ambers
flanders
red
save
the
pucker
which
is
what
this
is
most
reminiscent
of
to
someone
whos
only
had
2
or
3
other
braggots
bob
was
a
big
evangelist
of
meads
on
the
local
homebrew
scene
and
this
brew
is
a
fitting
tribute
cheers
bob
i
drank
immediately
from
the
bottle
just
because
it
was
a
vacation
does
not
mean
im
not
all
business
d
honestly
i
quit
halfway
through
the
bottle
and
struggled
to
make
it
that
far
as
intriguing
as
this
is
its
best
served
in
small
doses
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
but
its
not
a
beer
that
i
must
return
to
either
certainly
worth
a
try
just
be
sure
to
have
some
equally
interested
sipping
partners
to
share
with
weirdest
beer
ive
ever
had
as
it
started
with
burnt
rubber
and
a
medicinal
band
aid
flavor
as
it
warmed
it
became
more
acceptable
as
the
honey
made
an
appearance
it
became
kind
of
smoky
and
jerky
like
as
it
yielded
a
caramel
apple
flavor
like
i
said
weirdest
beer
ever
wouldve
been
nice
if
theyd
left
the
smoke
out
of
it
NA

this
was
a
big
wow
on
first
whiff
and
first
taste
but
becomes
a
bit
of
a
chore
by
the
end
a
little
too
sweet
and
a
touch
cloying
biggest
problem
though
is
the
sheer
booziness
whose
level
has
only
been
rivaled
for
me
in
things
like
samichlaus
or
perhaps
the
most
crazy
and
aggressive
of
dfh
brews
a
nice
mediumheavy
bodied
beverage
i
am
quite
familiar
with
white
winter
winerys
meads
but
this
was
my
first
time
tasting
any
of
their
braggots
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
what
i
found
it
packs
a
punch
but
remains
somewhat
drinkable
though
thats
not
to
say
i
would
drink
more
than
one
glass
in
a
sitting
id
recommend
sharing
or
sipping
by
the
fire
in
the
dead
of
winter
drinkability
is
great
the
alcohol
12
according
to
the
label
is
mostly
hidden
the
barrel
character
melds
very
well
with
the
braggot
complimenting
without
overshadowing
the
honey
is
allowed
to
come
through
quite
nicely
without
presenting
as
cloying
or
overly
sweet
in
sum
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
complimented
by
honey
and
oak
good
stuff
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
orange
real
neat
colour
thick
light
tan
head
forms
quickly
settles
down
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
and
layer
some
lace
spots
stick
to
the
glass
syrupy
looking
nice
smell
is
real
nice
heavy
caramel
honey
very
floral
bready
some
fruity
hoppiness
wood
and
vanilla
very
earthy
brandy
some

really
neat
and

comes
through

is
similar

finish
mouthfeel
is

bodied
quite
thick
with
low
to
medium

some
heat
from
the
alcohol
but
not
unpleasant
a
real
nice
braggot
which
is
unfortunately
a
tough
style
to
find
commercially
well
done
thanks
g
huge
thanks
to
demcorhip
for
picking
this
up
from
the
winery
for
me
originally
reviewed
april
9
2005
on
tap
at
the
gitchee
gumee
brewfest
2005
this
beer
was
a
cozy
mahogany
color
aromas
were
strong
of
chicory
and
sugar
flavors
of
chocolate
and
rum
with
alcohol
very
present
seems
i
like
it
this
way
good
smooth
sweet
finish
d
the
big
sharp
rum
flavor
is
nice
and
has
some
good
supporting
flavors
in
the
oak
and
dark
malt
very
unique
and
a
bit
foreign
to
my
taste
buds
thanks
to
murrayswine
for
the
chance
to
try
this
interesting
beverage
i
cant
say
that
it
looks
appealing
as
it
pours
a
thick
gross
brown
color
with
almost
no
carbonationdaunting
im
scared
it
smells
caramelly
vinuous
with
some
spicy
hops
basically
it
looks
and
smells
like
an
old
ale
taste
is
sweet
like
caramel
and
prunes
still
reminding
me
of
an
old
ale
but
diverges
from
that
style
with
a
spicy
honeyness
and
a
little
toasty
finish
that
surprised
me
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
thick
very
thick
coating
ive
not
had
many
old
ales
or
braggots
but
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
thomas
hardys
ale
drinkability
is
there
such
a
thing
with
braggots
so
sweet
so
thick
soooo
cloying
and
sticky
sip
isnt
the
proper
word
for
it
ill
say
slow
goin
its
as
drinkable
as
malt
vinegar
you
can
only
handle
so
much
before
your
taste
buds
begin
screaming
for
you
to
stop
this
was
actually
quite
enjoyable
well
rounded
flavors
and
a
nice
oaky
background
i
could
see
this
beer
going
very
well
with
a
nice
juicy
pot
roast
or
even
some
asian
dishes
its
kind
of
pricey
for
the
halfbottle
375ml
but
well
worth
a
try
drinkability
after
2
small
wine
glasses
of
this
i
macgyvered
a
cork
with
a
couple
napkins
and
a
piece
of
plastic
wrap
although
id
had
enough
im
looking
forward
to
finishing
this
tomorrow
its
not
something
i
could
take
in
large
doses
but
thats
not
important
anyways
sweetlovers
might
have
a
winner
here
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
honey
and
malt
and
jamminess
work
wonderfully
here
theres
a
touch
of
hops
but
im
not
picking
up
on
much
spice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
to
thin
which
works
with
this
beer
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
a
winter
delight
a
good
change
of
pace
from
barleywines
and
stouts
as
for
winter
brews
almost
a
session
beer
but
a
touch
too
alcoholic
bottle
says
7
that
said
if
i
didnt
know
or
care
id
knock
back
a
couple
twothree
in
a
row
on
a
winter
night
overall
very
interesting
and
deep
tasty
with
the
mouthfeel
being
the
highlight
this
has
improved
so
much
over
time
i
cant
wait
to
try
another
bottle
next
year
too
sweet
for
me
to
be
easily
drinkable
got
better
as
the
glass
emptied
im
not
well
versed
in
mead
but
if
thats
what
they
were
going
for
i
dont
think
they
failed
just
not
my
style
a
bottle
at
a
party
this
is
my
first
reviewed
mead
though
dogfish
midas
touch
seemed
close
at
the
time
clove
color
decent
head
of
12
of
an
inch
and
lots
of
dotty
laces
over
sheets
of
clinging
liquid
sweet
potato
pie
aroma
prickly
cinnamon
mace
and
requisite
honey
plenty
of
body
ill
expand
after
more
experience
with
braggots
lots
of
a
unidimensional
sweetness
good
spice
but
more
like
a
bowl
of
honey
nut
cheerios
than
the
more
changing
profile
of
a
beer
not
bad
not
an
easy
drinker
for
me
ive
been
schooled
on
mead
making
but
the
same
guy
could
only
tell
me
to
say
whether
or
not
i
liked
it
when
evaluating
it
the
beer
pours
a
limpid
brown
color
the
head
impressive
in
size
the
texture
frothy
and
the
lace
produce
is
sticky
sheets
that
cling
tightly
to
the
glass
honey
sweet
nose
malt
and
a
bit
spicy
quite
a
change
of
pace
thickly
sweet
at
the
front
the
top
middling
in
feel
with
a
finish
that
is
minimally
carbonated
just
a
touch
of
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
also
dry
different
to
be
sure
as
i
said
a
change
of
pace
but
not
something
i
would
want
everyday
good
in
its
own
right
nonetheless
o
this
was
my
first
brag
got
which
reminded
me
of
a
sweeter
dessert
barleywine
the
notes
of
honey
come
through
and
work
well
with
the
dark
dried
fruits
the
alcohol
presence
along
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
keep
this
from
becoming
too
sweet
definitely
worth
trying
o
this
drinks
like
a
sweet
barleywine
but
without
the
hops
presence
great
depth
and
feel
though
the
balance
leans
towards
malty
sweetness
is
this
that
style
of
beer
from
the
old
world
made
with
no
hops
i
think
it
might
be
it
pours
a
soothing
looking
pale
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
smells
incredibly
floral
lavender
i
reckon
with
all
kings
of
interesting
yeast
going
on
the
flavor
is
totally
lavender
not
quite
hand
soap
but
similarly
potent
its
pollenated
and
fresh
more
springtime
than
autumn
but
delicious
just
the
same
the
alcohol
is
also
pretty
potent
feel
is
good
smooth
and
well
carbonated
with
a
nice
medium
body
its
a
real
different
brew
the
floral
notes
are
so
up
front
more
so
than
almost
any
beer
i
can
remember
i
like
it
a
lot
but
the
small
8oz
pours
are
plenty
overall
something
one
of
a
kind
and
worth
a
try
i
had
it
at
vine
street
but
i
think
its
on
at
all
three
mountain
sun
spots
not
a
crisp
beer
but
not
filmy
either
8oz
glass
was
just
enough
to
have
two
serving
it
in
a
bigger
glass
would
have
been
too
much
at
once
odd
d
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
very
much
a
mead
meets
beer
experience
which
was
the
point
im
really
glad
i
tried
it
overall
really
balanced
and
well
done
probably
my
favorite
braggot
to
date
this
is
not
your
typical
american
strong
ale
it
pours
a
delicate
sand
color
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
is
very
malty
and
sweet
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
in
control
the
taste
is
also
malt
strong
with
mellow
some
floral
hops
there
is
a
well
balanced
honey
flavor
in
the
mix
this
stuff
has
a
full
yet
crisp
body
delicious
o
nice
introduction
into
the
braggot
style
something
new
to
me
and
different
o
a
very
nice
braggot
the
honey
makes
this
a
little
syrupy
on
the
mouthfeel
as
it
coats
your
throat
with
a
film
this
is
ok
i
get
what
they
are
going
for
but
its
a
bit
too
sweet
honey
for
me
overall
hard
to
pull
off
of
a
good
braggot
this
is
good
but
mostly
because
of
the
vanilla
tastes
much
better
than
it
looks
slightly
heavy
with
a
honey
sweetness
but
not
overwhelming
very
tasty
beer
for
a
cold
day
too
bad
its
a
one
timer
for
acb
such
a
strange
and
tasty
ipa
mead
hybrid
no
idea
where
the
other
guy
got
barleywine
from
but
the
brewery
listed
it
as
an
india
pale
braggot
420lbs
of
orange
blossom
honey
and
a
shit
ton
of
hops
great
collab
with
b
nektar
finishes
thick
with
a
sweet
edge
and
is
a
good
beer
to
try
my
favorite
of
the
woodfour
beers
i
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
sour
braggot
we
have
not
seen
this
before
that
i
am
aware
of
a
nice
honey
malt
base
thats
floral
and
bright
and
sweet
and
strong
super
clean
and
unique
wheat
and
honey
are
dominant
flavors
up
front
with
the
sourness
coming
later
its
more
sour
than
their
other
beers
but
still
to
me
tastes
like
more
of
a
mature
brett
wild
ale
than
it
does
a
lacto
sour
some
fruity
pucker
to
the
finish
but
its
largely
balanced
out
by
that
honey
aspect
that
is
so
forward
and
fresh
its
almost
herbal
not
hoppy
in
the
least
but
has
a
sort
of
green
tea
element
in
there
mid
palate
i
like
the
fusion
of
styles
here
its
almost
like
a
tart
baby
barleywine
or
something
hard
to
describe
but
definitely
a
success
never
really
had
anything
else
like
it
like
most
of
the
woodfour
beer
it
could
stand
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
i
like
its
smoothness
as
is
these
guys
are
doing
something
pretty
unique
to
say
the
least
worth
the
wait
for
the
next
offering
in
the
exit
series
some
blueberry
tones
but
not
too
much
15
abv
seems
high
but
who
am
i
to
judge
had
this
one
on
good
friday
excellent
taste
feel
but
be
careful
it
packs
a
punch
15
abv
is
strong
o
this
is
a
very
powerful
beer
an
adventurous
offering
as
an
unabashed
nj
supporter
i
love
these
guys
but
share
this
with
friends
because
its
strong
not
great
heavy
taste
you
cant
taste
the
strong
abv
but
its
ok
what
stuck
out
in
the
aftertaste
was
the
mintline
briskness
of
the
aftertaste
and
the
booze
boy
was
this
strong
for
a
beer
and
even
for
a
braggot
this
was
about
as
heavy
as
one
could
get
when
it
came
to
the
alcohol
while
not
a
knockout
this
was
no
brew
to
be
messed
with
and
by
the
time
i
polished
off
this
25
4
oz
bottle
i
could
feel
the
warming
and
subtly
overpowering
effect
of
the
alcohol
while
not
quite
as
good
the
other
offerings
in
the
exit
series
this
was
a
worthy
addition
to
the
line
and
a
solid
beer
to
complement
a
winter
that
doesnt
quite
want
to
go
away
yet
flying
fish
is
still
one
the
best
and
creative
breweries
in
my
home
state
and
this
is
another
example
of
what
thats
so
grab
a
bottle
and
let
the
warm
up
to
the
style
has
to
offer
sweet
taste
the
blueberry
comes
out
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
but
very
pleasant
overall
so
so
harsh
buttery
medicinal
honey
and
belgian
yeast
just
the
slightest
touch
of
blueberry
for
15
the
abv
is
hidden
extremely
well
why
do
i
feel
that
flying
fish
is
lying
on
the
abv
overall
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
didnt
leave
a
big
impression
overall
the
blueberries
dont
add
a
classic
flavor
but
have
really
taken
the
braggot
to
a
different
level
real
enjoyable
brew
and
delicious
a
solid
beer
not
the
best
but
good
where
the
hell
are
the
blueberries
in
this
real
nice
look
which
is
a
light
copper
color
blueberry
smell
of
course
with
a
bit
of
orange
and
sage
flavor
is
mainly
blueberry
with
some
orange
sage
honey
and
a
bit
of
a
bubble
gum
flavor
definitely
taste
alcohol
as
well
but
not
dominant
reminds
me
oft
a
mild
blueberry
brandy
but
not
near
as
thick
and
other
flavors
do
come
out
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
with
light
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
treat
as
rarely
get
opportunity
to
have
a
braggot
a
sipper
that
would
go
great
at
a
bonfire
hammonton
should
be
proud
as
blueberries
really
come
through
another
unique
exit
series
offering
alcohol
is
hidden
well
but
it
is
extremely
too
sweet
i
havent
had
a
braggot
in
a
really
long
time
so
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
a
beautiful
blend
of
ingredients
between
the
honey
malt
blueberry
orange
peel
lemon
peel
and
belgian
and
champagne
yeasts
i
even
noticed
a
couple
pieces
of
blueberry
skin
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
i
will
most
likely
snatch
up
a
bottle
of
this
if
i
see
it
somewhere
a
real
treat
to
try
on
tap
flying
fishs
regular
lineup
is
mostly
forgettable
but
thats
not
the
case
for
the
exit
series
its
been
a
long
time
coming
but
this
latest
exit
series
beer
is
quite
different
from
the
others
but
still
excellent
the
taste
has
a
sweet
malt
flavor
with
gentle
fruity
quality
with
more
honey
and
thick
chewy
malt
with
light
medicinal
edge
and
slight
spice
with
dry
alcohol
flavor
in
the
finish
with
very
low
berry
in
comparison
to
honey
overall
not
a
bad
braggot
ok
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
pretty
smooth
considering
it
is
15
alcohol
alcohol
is
very
present
almost
like
a
liqueor
sticky
sweet
very
interesting
not
necessarily
blueberry
but
a
strong
fruit
presence
surprisingly
good
not
overpowered
by
alcohol
in
fact
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
not
at
all
overly
sweet
well
balanced
with
nice
blueberry
backbone
coming
through
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
i
cant
say
i
have
ever
been
a
big

slightly

minerally
this

overall
good

nothing
outstanding
easy
drinking
just
nothing
stands
out
at
all
i
dont
know
if
carbonation
would
help
this
beer
while
the
uniqueness
that
characterizes
oecs
offerings
is
definitely
there
this
just
doesnt

a
deep
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
when

no
head
just
a
thin
sudsy
band
around

shoulders
nose
is
quite
vinous
and
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
bourdeaux
there
are
also
notes
of
oak
and
balsamic
vinegar
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
there
is
also
a
hint
of
honey
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
virtually
still
carbonation
this
is
a
very
acidic
beer
and
it
almost
leaves
the
back
of
the
throat
feeling
a
bit
parched
between
quaffs
overall
very
interesting
with
a
great
deal
of
complexity
very
different
than
any
braggot
ive
ever
had
well
worth
seeking
out
extremely
complex
has
an
umami
feel
to
it
that
touches
a
lot
of
different
tastes
o
i
havent
had
many
braggots
to
compare
this
to
but
this
beer
was
extremely
unique
full
of
flavor
and
quite
tasty
oec
has
been
pumping
out
some
very
unique
and
interesting
blends
and
this
is
no
exception
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
for
everyone
but
its
definitely
worth
the
try
bottle
had
this
next
to
their
grandis
i
am
guessing
that
was
the
base
beer
well
this
one
had
coffee
mead
in
it
it
pours
like
a
liqueur
or
brandy
looks
oily
and
actually
leaves
legs
on
the
glass
no
bubbles
the
aroma
is
tart
and
has
some
diacetyl
and
acetone
characteristics
an
airy
sweetness
ripe
with
dried
dark
fruits
not
picking
up
much
roast
or
coffee
character
the
flavor
is
also
not
very
roasty
or
coffeelike
its
sweet
but
also
sour
and
tannic
vinous
very
very
rich
woody
and
oaky
slick
feel
with
almost
zero
carbonation
dense
not
sure
i
have
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
it
will
definitely

so
also
if
this
is
what
the
braggot

i
like
many
bas
had
been
curious
and
anxious
to
try
this
style
of
brewbraggot
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
consumed
in
my
experiences
ill
probably
grab
this
brew
again
samuel
adams
honey
queen
brewed
by
boston
beer
company
samuel
adams
this
brew
has
a
abv
of
7
50
before
we
get
to
the
review
this
is
my
first
braggot
brew
the
brew
pours
out
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
nice
white
head
im
going
to
say
this
brew
is
unfiltered
the
smell
is
rich
with
sweetness
and
grains
there
is
a
hit
of
spices
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
sweet
like
honey
there
is
also
some
grains
and
malts
at
the
end
honey
queen
goes
down
smooth
with
no
bad
after
taste
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
samuel
adams
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
it
was
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
5
out
of
5
3
5
d
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
best
that
ive
had
admittedly
the
vast
majority
of
the
better
braggots
ive
had
have
been
homebrew
in
any
case
im
glad
that
breweries
are
at
least
trying
has
a
nice
sweet
aroma
with
a
floral
backdrop
the
beer
is
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
pretty
big
white
head
it
has
a
nice
honey
flavor
that
stays
throughout
the
whole
beer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
moderate
carbonation
a
real
good
braggot
style
beer
braggots
need
to
make
a
comeback
so
i
like
that
this
is
out
and
widely
available
the
color
is
just
like
honey
clear
and
radiant
golden
a
real
green
tea
and
honey
sort
of
nose
very
nice
without
any
appreciable
hops
at
all
yeast
is
cool
too
farmy
and
bright
the
honey
is
the
dominant
flavor
and
grain
seems
to
be
quite
light
in
it
which
is
cool
for
a
strong
ale
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
though
to
drink
much
of
and
the
alcohol
shows
though
the
other
flaw
it
has
for
me
is
that
its
still
i
dont
know
if
all
braggot
is
supposed
to
be
this
way
or
not
but
this
has
no
bubbles
at
all
and
as
such
seems
watery
and
thin
i
wish
it
had
more
to
it
there
but
the
flavors
are
really
nice
cool
of
sam
to
make
bigger
beers
in
styles
we
dont
see
much
of
overall
nice
enough
a
little
bit
of
a
lightweight
weird
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
with
some
fascinating
flavors
it
seemed
like
an
okay
concept
but
i
needed
a
bit
more
on
the
finish
to
really
hammer
it
home
inquiring
into
the
new
asyetunmarked
tap
at
the
bar
i
was
told
it
was
a
mead
beer
i
ordered
it
forthwith
knowing
too
well
how
rare
braggots
are
at
bars
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
brass
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
chamomile
light
nutmeg
sweet
cereal
grains
light
dried
honey
and
sweet
white
wine
grapes
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
flowers
honey
chamomile
and
grapes
shining
through
and
combining
fairly
well
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mildly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
braggot
one
of
the
better
experimental
beers
sam
adams
has
put
out
in
recent
memory
22
ounce
bottle
into

pours
fairly
crystal
clear

head
with

retention
that
reduces
to
a

flavors
with
a
nice

and
no
cloying

after
the

medium
carbonation
and

with
a
very
smooth
crisp
and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
braggot
style
all
around
good
complexity
and
balance
of
honey
pale
malt
and
spice
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
this
is
the
first
of
the
style
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
i
liked
honey
a
lot
so
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
the
story
on
how
the
beer
style
created
also
intrigued
me
the
first
thing
that
stood
out
to
me
was
the
aftertaste
which
reminded
me
of
tart
tasting
mixture
this
beer
had
some
caramel
i
believe
but
the
citric
and
honey
overpower
the
smell
of
it
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
it
was
not
one
i
would
try
again
i
do
want
to
try
more
of
the
style
overall
much
milder
flavor
than
i
expected
sweet
but
not
overly
so
pairs
well
with
spicy
foods
like
bbq
texmex
or
indian
food
overall
an
above
average
beer
that
has
nice
and
deep
layers
of
honey
however
if
you
do
not
like
honey
this
beer
offers
little
else
i
would
pick
this
up
again
but
there
are
others
in
the
small
batch
series
that
i
prefer
pours
a
nice
deep
gold
with
a
frosty
and
yogurty
white
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
smell
is
clean
and
fresh
nice
clean
floral
and
sweet
beer
with
a
nice
honey
sweetness
at
the
finish
i
did
not
think
i
was
going
to
enjoy
this
but
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
a
very
good
beer
o
a
honey
of
a
summer
brew
ladies
will
love
this
light
sweet
tasty
treat
would
pair
well
with
lemon
cake
poured
into
an
elysian
snifter
pours
a
medium
golden
honey
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
thick
lacing
aroma
of
mead
floral
and
herbal
spicing
mildly
tealike
and
vinous
flavor
starts
with
quite
sweet
floral
and
apple
juice
but
dries
out
a
bit
to
exhibit
meadlike
character
finishing
estery
and
sweet
with
floral
notes
and
at
last
a
lingering
light
honey
taste
that
is
mild
enough
to
be
quite
pleasant
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
style
with
few
european
examples
to
compare
and
possibly
few
historically
accurate
ones
in
any
case
ive
had
only
one
danish
braggot
and
a
domestic
one
made
with
prickly
pear
so
i
can
only
guess
to
compare
this
in
style
it
is
certainly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
honey
beer
sweet
and
floral
it
is
much
sweeter
than
most
mead
but
i
did
enjoy
the
pure
honey
flavor
in
the
finish
which
is
usually
lost
in
mead
good
floral
notes
but
it
seemed
to
skate
on
the
edge
of
cloying
sweetness
also
slightly
tame
like
many
boston
beer
offerings
an
enjoyable
honey
fruit
and
floral
ale
that
left
me
wishing
i
could
go
back
a
few
centuries
to
taste
the
real
thing
not
a
bad
interpretation
of
a
rare
style
this
is
the
first
braggot
ive
knowingly
tried
and
i
was
moderately
impressed
while
being
sweet
it
wasnt
so
sweet
that
i
needed
an
insulin
chaser
the
honey
flavor
was
rather
unique
better
than
most
of
the
meads
ive
tried
i
would
recommend
trying
this
but
only
buy
one
bottle
honey
cirrus
mild
spiciness
more
honey
flavors
of
honey
honey
honey
mild
hay
initially
some
citrus
maybe
some
tangerine
a
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
did
i
mention
the
honey
fairly
smooth
mellow
finish
overall
worth
the
but
not
a
beer
you
will
want
regularly
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
example
of
a
braggot
it
had
some
nice
aspects
and
i
liked
the
different
flavors
that
honey
imparted
especially
the
honey
dew
and
white
grape
flavors
but
i
thought
the
honey
pretty
much
took
over
and
along
with
the
chamomile
it
made
it
hard
to
pick
up
any
flavors
that
the
base
beer
imparted
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
not
too
cloying
a
little
creamy
not
too
crisp
not
too
filling
but
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
think
the
chamomile
would
start
to
wear
on
me
after
one
glass
so
i
think
that
would
be
my
limit
but
i
think
it
makes
for
a
decent
summertime
beer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
fruity
and
floral
flavors
and
aromas
that
the
honey
imparted
they
were
nice
and
little
unique
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
chamomile
i
dont
think
it
really
added
anything
thing
to
this
beer
and
i
think
it
held
this
beer
back
from
being
as
good
as
it
could
be
and
i
also
i
wish
it
just
had
better
balance
and
that
the
beer
base
was
more
noticeable
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
nice
to
try
but
it
isnt
something
that
i
could
see
myself
getting
again
and
i
might
recommend
it
if
you
really
like
braggots
but
i
dont
think
the
average
craft
beer
drinker
would
really
dig
it
all
in
all
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
think
it
was
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
and
it
could
use
a
little
work
and
some
balancing
out
this
isnt
my
favorite
braggot
or
my
favorite
beer
from
samuel
adams
its
nice
to
see
sam
adams
tackle
a
style
like
this
and
im
glad
they
tried
it
but
i
think
with
a
little
work
it
could
be
a
much
better
beer
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
i
think
this
one
needs
a
little
work
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
is
a
real
honey
bomb
o
honey
queen
provides
a
deep
honeycomb
labyrinth
of
flavor
transfixed
on
the
characteristics
of
the
honey
added
more
so
than
any
other
beer
brewed
with
honey
ive
ever
encountered
almost
meadlike
this
higher
alcohol
brew
though
its
strength
isnt
even
hinted
at
is
incredibly
smooth
with
floral
spice
and
orange
citrus
complexities
tying
the
whole
brew
together
in
one
exceptional
drinking
experience
overall
this
is
a
tasty
braggot
and
seems
to
be
going
fast
in
this
area
i
drank
it
with
two
girls
and
i
scored
a
phone
number
poured
from
650
ml
bomber
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
5513
an
interesting
brew
to
try
once
for
me
rich
golden
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
a
half
inch
thick
rocky
white
head
rests
on
top
aroma
of
chamomile
and
sweet
honey
the
flavor
is
of
floral
chamomile
and
dryyet
gently
sweet
honey
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
theres
a
warming
sensation
in
the
mouth
theres
more
honey
in
the
fadebut
the
sweetness
is
strained
drinkable
enough
but
was
looking
for
more
depth
of
flavor
worth
a
try
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
props
to
sammy
for
trying
this
venerable
old
style
on
a
large
scale
maybe
only
the
second
or
3rd
of
this
style
i
remember
trying
o
i
love
honey
so
i
love
this
beer
it
is
a
little
strange
though
o
a
solid
honey
ale
that
definitely
treads
into
mead
territory
which
is
what
a
braggot
is
supposed
to
be
it
is
pretty
one
dimensional
in
terms
of
being
honey
forward
with
the
nice
floral
aspect
but
thats
all
it
really
needs
a
great
summertimewarm
weather
brew
an
enjoyable
braggot
as
far
as
braggots
go
id
recommend
this
one
to
a
ticker
trying
to
tick
away
this
particular
style
its
not
a
bad
goaround
overall
good
brew
and
i
respect
it
but
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
my
first
braggot
so
i
cant
really
compare
to
others
in
the
style
as
a
mead
fan
though
i
can
see
the
appeal
light
and
refreshing
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
considering
the
amount
of
honey
worth
trying
its
enough
to
make
me
pursue
other
braggots
different
style
of
beer
good
as
a
dessert
beer
nice
and
worth
repeating
a
surprisingly
light
and
refreshing
braggot
goes
down
very
smoothly
considering
the
7
5
abv
i
am
impressed
taste
is
sweet
bready
absolutely
has
the
honey
very
slight
bite
on
the
finish
a
definite
thirst
quencher
makes
me
want
to
try
mead
next
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
from
the
style
but
it
was
pleasant
not
the
greatest
but
good
especially
during
a
warm
summer
day
the
braggot
exits
the
bomber
a
nice
yellow
coloralmost
reminiscent
of
honeywith
a
cap
of
cotton
white
foam
lots
of
bubbles
rising
up
pale
malt
wheat
bread
honey
grassy
hops
form
the
aroma
on
the
palate
the
honey
stands
through
the
center
its
dry
and
a
little
sweet
as
it
sticks
around
after
the
swallow
the
sweetness
is
strong
this
is
a
honey
beer
but
it
isnt
over
the
top
bitterness
at
the
end
does
much
to
provide
balance
overall
a
good
beer
if
you
like
your
beer
sweet
i
believe
this
os
my
first
braggot
was
thinking
about
trying
this
once
as
a
home
brew
but
this
is
easier
thanks
boston
beer
for
brewing
this
one
overall
this
beer
should
be
part
of
their
summer
series
it
is
perfect
for
warm
weather
and
would
be
a
my
go
to
over
most
summer
ales
and
hefeweizens
i
am
not
sure
if
thats
their
marketing
scheme
but
they
should
go
for
it
drink
up
and
enjoy
salud
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
both
aged
and
fresh
braggots
are
pretty
unique
and
something
that
i
would
like
to
see
done
more
often
i
love
the
honey
accent
to
it
o
my
first
sip
of
this
overpowered
me
with
sweetness
on
my
second
sip
with
perhaps
my
buds
adjusted
it
was
obviously
not
something
i
was
going
to
drainpour
as
syrup
that
said
it
was
still
an
interesting
beer
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
hoppedup
hard
cider
in
its
opening
sweetness
and
an
overly
sweet
barley
wine
in
its
dark
sugar
ending
an
amazing
dessert
beer
o
this
is
my
first
braggot
not
that
theyre
popular
cant
say
ive
ever
tried
mead
before
either
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
nice
drink
to
sip
on
as
it
is
sweet
and
high
in
abv
though
neither
are
overpowering
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
aged
if
you
can
find
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
murky
amber
brown
like
honey
muddled
with
mud
and
water
the
beer
pours
with
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
that
fizzle
away
and
appear
almost
sodalike
in
quality
the
beers
body
is
murky
like
fresh
honey
the
other
side
of
the
glass
is
indiscernible
through
the
haze
but
some
light
does
travel
through
the
beer
it
leaves
a
thin
set
of
legs
on
the
glass
when
it
washes
up
against
the
sides
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
richly
of
fresh
wildflower
honey
sticky
and
rich
on
the
nose
the
honey
muddles
with
thick
caramel
malts
similar
to
long
trails
triple
bag
maple
syrup
honey
toffee
and
even
some
chocolate
fudge
touch
upon
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sticky
sweet
but
a
little
too
bitter
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
on
the
middle
of
the
palate
hot
booze
tingles
as
the
beer
travels
down
the
throat
and
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
for
what
i
want
with
just
a
touch
of
boozy
sweet
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
practically
heavy
with
a
chewy
slightly
rough
mouthfeel
and
faint
carbonation
the
beer
bites
at
the
tongue
oddly
enough
which
takes
away
from
the
rich
honeyed
flavors
that
the
beer
should
possess
it
does
however
gel
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
some
syrupy
goodness
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sweet
caramel
barley
which
turns
into
fiery
alcohol
with
some
interesting
spice
character
and
a
touch
of
woodiness
on
the
middle
of
the
palate
the
finish
is
hot
and
cloying
with
fusel
notes
touches
of
stone
fruit
and
raisins
can
briefly
be
felt
on
the
tongue
but
really
this
beer
is
all
about
the
hot
booze
on
the
finish
the
aftertaste
finally
brings
hints
of
sticky
sweet
honey
to
the
tongue
where
it
creates
a
pool
of
saliva
as
the
beer
warms
it
mellows
some
of
its
rougher
edges
but
still
hits
the
palate
with
too
much
booze
and
not
enough
honey
character
overall
this
beer
is
lacking
in
sweet
soft
honey
flavors
that
i
want
from
it
i
want
a
sticky
thick
beer
but
this
just
doesnt
quite
deliver
for
me
the
smell
is
rich
with
honey
character
but
i
get
none
in
the
taste
i
suspect
that
with
time
in
a
cellar
this
beer
will
open
up
into
a
rich
and
unique
dessert
beer
but
its
a
bit
of
a
hot
mess
fresh
complexity
in
this
beer
opens
up
the
warmer
it
is
but
it
still
is
a
muddled
mess
on
the
palate
if
you
have
a
bottle
sit
on
it
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
dark
almost
opaque
brown
coloring
with
a
thin
whispy
coat
of
white
film
on
the
surface
nose
of
rich
honey
apple
sweet
roast
caramel
and
booze
highlights
smells
very
rich
with
some
earthy
tones
also
flavors
are
rich
and
sweet
on
the
forward
tongue
with
a
blending
of
roast
caramel
and
honey
balancing
well
rich
and
sweet
with
a
subtle
warmth
building
as
you
drink
and
a
shift
of
the
palate
towards
a
more
honey
focused
characteristic
tangy
sweet
and
rich
into
the
aftertaste
with
a
cleanliness
in
the
finish
thanks
to
the
body
and
the
booze
the
body
is
smooth
and
robust
which
works
perfectly
with
the
flavor
profiles
solid
brew
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
its
a
big
beer
as
for
would
i
search
this
one
out
not
me
i
actually
brewed
a
braggot
and
i
have
to
say
that
it
was
much
more
drinkable
than
this
one
just
a
better
flavor
overall
this
one
is
too
one
dimensional
with
its
only
flavor
being
that
huge
caramel
deal
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
but
its
not
one
that
id
come
back
to
this
is
a
barley
winebragget
ale
that
definitely
tastes
like
an
ale
i
had
this
at
room
temperature
in
the
english
fashion
as
such
it
gave
a
nice
full
head
mildly
carbonated
thinnish
mouthfeel
nice
amber
color
otherwise
tasted
like
an
average
ale
not
too
bitter
definitely
not
sweet
did
not
pick
up
on
any
honey
or
other
allegedly
complex
notes
but
as
the
ale
is
meant
to
mature
with
age
could
have
just
been
too
young
overall
not
exciting
but
not
terrible
id
probably
try
it
again
in
a
different
format
to
see
if
there
was
any
difference
overall
its
pretty
good
nothing
terribly
exciting
but
nice
flavors
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
braggot
it
reminded
me
of
an
english
old
ale
or
barleywine
i
think
they
pulled
off
an
excellent
marriage
in
the
flavors
of
honey
and
malt
well
done
wifey
and
i
picked
this
up
during
our
honeymoon
at
mdi
and
saved
it
for
a
snowy
day
made
some
fine
blizzard
nemo
drinking
in
the
dark
o
fantastic
one
of
the
best
brews
of
the
tasting
which
included
some
killer
beers
my
first
bragget
was
indeed
a
treat
and
i
wish
i
could
get
more
of
these
poured
from
22oz
bottle
into
crooked
stave
glass
pours
a
brownorange
with
much
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
slight
ring
of
head
lots
of
dried
fruit
and
figgy
raison
aroma
with
a
huge
dose
of
booze
very
similar
flavor
figgy
dried
fruit
slightly
sweet
and
lots
of
peppery
heat
not
overly
done
but
a
great
great
brew
very
similar
to
an
aged
barley
wine
and
just
awesome
worth
the
wait
o
overall
this
was
a
decent
enough
beer
from
a
somewhat
readily
available
brewery
still
though
far
too
much
boozeheat
for
being
roughly
2
years
old
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
slightly
murky
looking
gold
color
with
a
really
nice
white
head
on
top
the
head
was
foamy
and
soft
looking
it
also
had
a
good
retention
but
not
much
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
of
course
an
assault
of
honey
aromas
with
a
touch
of
malt
in
there
too
no
hop
aroma
at
all
the
taste
of
the
beer
betters
as
it
warms
up
but
at
no
point
in
time
does
this
beer
disappoint
in
this
category
the
beer
is
more
malty
when
its
cold
as
the
beer
warms
the
honey
profile
really
shines
through
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
its
soft
and
very
easy
to
drink
low
carbonation
but
just
enough
to
keep
it
alive
and
the
booze
comes
out
a
little
more
as
the
beer
warms
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
example
of
a
braggot
i
would
personally
enjoy
aging
this
beer
and
seeing
how
it
evolves
over
time
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
the
honey
is
there
and
makes
the
beer
smooth
but
some
alcohol
is
pretty
prevelant
in
the
taste
think
some
more
time
would
have
done
this
one
well
but
still
a
pretty
nice
beer
o
the
thin
body
and
booziness
detract
although
the
beer
is
interesting
just
adding
that
i
had
my
2007
vintage
not
much
a
difference
in
the
beer
excpet
a
much
more
noticable
alcohol
flavor
still
remains
one
of
my
top
favorites
b
o
though
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
burn
going
down
this
is
almost
hard
to
believe
this
is
a
beer
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
for
two
reasons
1
the
sweetness
2
the
abv
will
help
you
sleep
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
o
a
good
and
drinkable
brew
whether
its
a
honey
ale
braggot
or
barley
wine
i
easily
give
two
schlitz
for
this
great
bragget
im
glad
that
i
waited
until
the
winter
months
to
consume
this
bottle
though
it
is
light
enough
in
feel
for
yearround
consumption
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
stronger
beer
to
sip
on
for
a
while
but
there
are
other
highabv
beers
that
i
would
pick
first
i
really
liked
this
one
and
the
best
of
the
style
from
my
limited
experience
pretty
enjoyable
beer
high
alcohol
very
sweet
lote
of
honey
but
overall
a
ll
balanced
beer
this
one
will
get
you
drunk
overall
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
and
one
i
would
have
again
for
sure
thanks
a
really
well
aged
beer
not
at
all
like
when
its
fresh
very
intense
and
complex
but
ultimately
similar
to
a
red
wine
in
flavor
and
drinkability
a
really
really
good
bragget
need
more
now
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
light
honey
appearance
is
of
a
dark
honey
color
almost
reddish
the
taste
is
of
sweet
honey
almost
sugary
bread
light
butterscotch
spicy
mix
as
it
sits
on
your
palate
after
a
sip
it
warms
probably
from
the
higher
alcohol
content
overall
this
was
very
good
i
had
this
with
a
good
cigar
and
it
was
the
perfect
compliment
it
was
pricey
at
11
for
a
little
over
a
pint
but
it
was
delicious
i
would
buy
a
few
of
these
if
i
come
across
them
again
and
put
them
away
for
a
good
drink
with
a
stogie
i
bought
this
after
a
tour
of
the
atlantic
brewing
company
in
bar
harbor
last
weekend
this
is
an
interesting
and
fairly
rare
style
of
beer
so
it
is
hard
to
judge
it
is
similar
to
barleywine
which
i
prefer
more
and
if
i
wanted
something
strong
that
tastes
like
honey
id
pour
myself
some
mead
despite
this
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
visiting
the
area
as
you
can
often
find
it
on
the
shelves
around
here
o
tasty
brew
it
was
my
first
braggot
so
i
was
expecting
something
very
different
it
didnt
satisfy
in
terms
of
that
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
reddish
orange
amber
color
with
a
decent
fluffy
white
head
that
has
moderate
retention
smells
of
honey
sweet
bready
malt
caramel
butterscotch
slightly
spicy
with
a
hint
of
oxidation
it
really
screams
english
ale
to
me
if
that
makes
any
kind
of
sense
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
lots
of
ripe
fruit
mixed
with
a
honey
bready
thing
slightly
spicy
most
of
the
way
through
but
finishes
with
a
twinge
of
alcohol
and
a
lingering
earthy
bitterness
medium
to
thick
body
light
carbonation
sweet
almost
sticky
mouthfeel
i
found
this
quite
complex
but
i
feel
the
flavors
are
still
competing
maybe
this
needs
some
time
its
good
now
but
i
suspect
it
might
be
great
with
some
age
thanks
to
my
father
for
sharing
this
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brownishorange
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
honey
but
i
also
get
some
light
floral
notes
the
flavor
is
more
complex
than
the
aroma
the
honey
and
floral
notes
are
present
once
again
but
i
also
get
a
ton
of
sugary
sweetness
and
some
dark
fruit
notes
the
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
d
pleasant
overall
but
quite
strong
it
would
probably
take
me
a
couple
hours
to
down
a
bottle
of
this
by
myself
this
is
interesting
overall
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
bit
heavy
but
it
was
anything
but
i
think
the
nose
is
better
then
the
taste
but
its
a
neat
drink
i
must
say
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
though
to
have
this
on
occasion
i
let
the
bottle
warm
up
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
before
opening
very
interesting
brew
poured
with
decent
foamy
thick
slightly
creamy
light
tan
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
dark
orange
copper
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
honey
malt
and
a
bit
of
funk
flavor
is
the
most
interesting
part
truly
a
cross
between
ale
and
mead
malt
a
hint
of
bitter
hop
and
honey
minus
the
heavy
honey
flavors
retaining
only
the
smooth
mellow
qualities
body
is
full
and
lush
with
perfect
carbonation
to
cut
through
the
sweetness
finish
is
like
flavor
and
is
quite
long
excellent
after
dinner
beer
maybe
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
an
interesting
style
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
even
though
i
am
an
avid
fan
of
barleywines
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
spice
however
im
happy
to
now
be
acquainted
with
a
truly
ancient
style
of
brewing
big
thanks
to
the
folks
at
atlantic
brewing
for
taking
a
few
risks
o
a
potent
and
highly
warming
mouthful
this
makes
no
bones
about
being
a
nearly
12
braggot
unlike
a
couple
others
ive
really
enjoyed
no
real
problems
with
this
fact
especially
when
imbibed
slowly
and
cautiously
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
thanks
to
alan
and
a
braggot
id
have
again
sharing
next
time
d
not
a
horrible
beer
considering
how
much
this
style
can
turn
into
a
honeybomb
fairly
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
balancing
fruit
tastes
d
goes
down
easily
pretty
tasty
somewhat
filliing
pretty
strong
kick
though
not
overpowering
this
is
a
sipper
albeit
one
that
goes
down
very
easy
d
cloying
towards
the
end
its
most
definitely
better
split
a
very
good
beer
though
i
love
mead
and
i
love
barleywine
the
combo
here
is
welldone
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
its
medium
light
not
much
carbonation
the
drinkability
depends
on
your
sweetness
tolerance
etc
for
me
i
do
like
sweeter
stuff
but
my
6oz
pour
was
plenty
d
of
course
the
drinkability
was
not
high
nor
do
i
believe
it
was
designed
to
be
pounded
in
large
quantities
on
that
note
this
was
pretty
drinkable
stuff
d
i
thought
this
was
very
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
want
a
huge
quantity
of
this
or
probably
any
braggot
for
that
matter
but
i
could
certainly
see
myself
sipping
on
a
mug
of
this
ancient
beverage
while
strolling
around
renn
fest
i
think
this
is
an
american
quad
with
something
added
in
keeping
with
the
massachusetts
pretty
things
theme
i
want
to
guess
its
baby
tree
perhaps
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
warm
honey
and
pale
malt
scent
its
a
little
sweet
in
the
nose
but
definately
bold
with
lots
of
alcohol
warmth
the
taste
is
much
the
same
its
sweet
up
front
with
a
good
honey
character
lots
of
alcohol
warmth
and
a
solid
pale
malt
base
this
is
a
young
beer
that
needs
some
aging
to
mellow
out
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
few
to
stash
away
to
try
in
a
few
years
pours
a
hazy
body
with
a
color
similar
to
medium
or
dark
honey
which
is
fitting
since
its
brewed
with
honey
less
than
a
finger
of
khaki
head
that
quickly
fades
to
leave
little
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
honey
plums
figs
rock
candy
and
lots
of
toasted
malts
faint
hint
of
booze
tastes
of
you
guessed
it
honey
mostly
sweet
bready
grains
dark
fruits
and
currants
caramel
slightly
vinous
and
a
little
bitter
citrus
no
hint
of
the
nearly
12
abv
contained
within
and
not
overly
bitter
or
sweet
very
well
balanced
velvety
smooth
low
carbonation
viscous
and
coating
but
not
syrupy
or
filmy
dangerously
easy
to
drink
not
at
all
hot
very
tasty
and
aromatic
great
body
and
feel
an
all
around
superb
beer
this
seems
to
be
more
along
the
lines
of
an
english
barlywine
a
nice
slow
sipper
d
actually
pretty
good
i
had
minimal
expectations
of
this
beer
since
ive
never
had
a
braggot
before
and
just
a
handful
of
meads
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
the
alcohol
does
begin
to
wear
on
you
d
a
snifter
of
this
is
just
about
the
perfect
amount
alcohol
is
a
bit
on
the
intense
side
limiting
its
drinkability
nice
sweet
flavors
most
likely
this
would
be
even
more
enjoyable
in
front
of
a
fire
on
a
winter
night
rather
than
outside
on
a
warm
summer
day
might
also
benefit
from
a
bit
of
age
to
temper
the
alcohol
heat
just
a
bit
nothin
like
sippin
a
braggot
while
watching
an
international
lawbased
film
pirate
radio
for
the
interested
it
pours
a
partly
cloudy
garnet
topped
by
a
minor
bit
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
honey
wow
no
way
white
grapes
cane
sugar
riesling
wheat
maple
syrup
light
citrus
hops
and
wellbaked
biscuits
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
the
honey
and
white
wineish
notes
taking
center
stage
and
then
some
a
nice
bit
of
orange
peel
bitterness
rides
on
up
near
the
end
to
provide
an
added
layer
of
complexity
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
an
almost
chewy
feel
overall
a
solid
braggot
but
not
necessarily
something
to
constantly
return
to
a
good
head
retention
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
the
color
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
opaque
iced
tea
little
visible
activity
in
the
beer
the
beer
moves
with
a
slight
sluggishness
indicating
some
viscosity
4

s
noticeable
orange
and
spice
honey
is
apparent
though
not
overpowering
alcohol
makes
a
showing
some
fig
and
mild
raisin
aromas

t
palate
is
slanted
towards
that
of
an
distilled
liquor
rather
than
a
beermead
alcohol
has
a
large
role
on
the
flavor
profile
and
reminds
me
a
little
of
rum
some
golden
raisin
and
dark
molasses
like
sweetness
3

m
dry
and
with
a
very
fine

like
grit
3

d
my
first
braggot
so
im
not
sure
what
to
really
expect
at
the
same
time
this
seemed
even
less
like
a
beer
than
what
i
was
expecting
the
high
alcohol
puts
enough
of
a
dry
burn
to
take
away
a
little
from
the
drinkability

a
most
interesting
twist
on
a
barleywine
and
resurrection
of
an
ancient
style
pour
into
a
snifter
allow
it
to
warm
and
enjoy
like
a
fine
spirit
d
there
is
enough
honey
here
to
keep
this
from
being
a
strait
barleywine
and
certainly
enough
malt
to
distinguish
it
from
a
mead
so
i
guess
it
lives
up
to
what
is
promised
on
the
label
however
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
character
that
i
would
expect
from
such
a
strong
beer
while
it
also
is
lacking
in
intensity
of
honey
character
it
is
a
somewhat
muddy
mixture
of
dull
flabby
honey
and
nondescript
brown
malt
which
is
just
shy
of
cloyingly
sweet
in
the
finish
i
would
have
hoped
for
some
brighter
honey
character
and
perhaps
a
greater
complexity
to
the
caramel
malt
but
both
of
these
areas
end
up
lacking
i
dont
know
the
age
of
this
bottle
it
seems
to
lack
any
sort
of
dating
and
it
might
improve
with
time
but
as
it
stands
it
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
md
light
to
medium
body
and
very
sticky
feel
this
beer
reminds
me
of
why
im
not
a
mead
drinker
quite
a
beautiful
beer
but
thats
about
all
it
has
going
for
me
very
honey
sweet
and
a
strange
hop
bitterness
that
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
yes
honey
and
hops
is
good
in
hopslam
but
this
is
completely
different
thinnish
body
and
low
carbonation
d
reasonably
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
isnt
really
hidden
at
all
that
boozy
heat
somewhat
detracts
from
the
drinkability
but
i
would
certainly
have
this
beer
again
brother
adams
bragget
is
pretty
good
stuff
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
it
doesnt
change
that
but
its
pretty
tasty
given
its
limited
range
its
really
not
deep
or
complex
at
all
but
still
tastes
good
the
nose
needs
work
but
it
performs
pretty
well
otherwise
if
youre
looking
to
knock
off
the
style
this
is
a
fine
place
to
do
it
if
thats
not
the
case
its
still
well
worth
a
try
d
especially
for
the
abv
very
unassuming
and
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
just
too
hot
for
me
perhaps
it
would
be
better
with
a
little
age
on
it
unfortunately
theres
no
date
on
the
bottle
drinkability
love
the
sweet
honey
malt
taste
a
sipper
but
i
could
have
a
couple
very
unique
as
a
beer
and
for
the
style
while
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
it
is
not
as
noticable
for
a
beer
with
abv
d
a
supremely
good
drink
for
such
a
big
honey
fermented
beer
the
4
years
seems
to
have
added
a
dry
texture
to
the
overall
mouthfeel
and
reduced
some
of
the
level
of
sweetness
as
i
had
this
fresh
on
my
birthday
last
june
and
it
seemed
less
dry
it
is
so
smooth
i
am
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
on
tap
w
4
years
of
age
on
it
overall
things
verge
on
cloying
but
never
quite
get
to
that
point
a
sweet
mead
can
be
far
more
cloying
and
despite
the
obvious
rich
malt
flavor
the
mellow
hop
bitterness
along
with
the
noticeable
alcohol
is
just
enough
to
keep
the
sweetness
from
going
too
far
a
very
nice
experience
indeed
this
would
undoubtedly
do
well
with
a
little
age
i
expected
it
to
be
dry
but
its
not
medium
body
lots
of
odd
sweetness
its
not
like
sugar
though
very
odd
second
taste
there
is
some
plum
fruitiness
in
there
and
a
lingering
sweetness
i
dont
know
what
to
say
its
much
bigeer
than
a
beer
i
would
normally
drink
lots
of
flowery
flavors
interesting
but
not
a
repeat
its
also
completely
making
me
drunk
lots
of
sweet
honey
in
the
aroma
a
faint
general
fruitiness
and
plenty
of
booze
i
strained
to
find
some
caramel
not
really
doing
much
for
me
its
very
alcoholic
the
taste
follows
with
initial
honeyfruit
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
overly
assertive
carbonation
for
the
style
finishes
with
plenty
of
booze
and
a
slight
tangy
spice
note
overall
very
robust
and
alcoholic
i
bet
it
would
age
well
but
i
am
glad
that
i
shared
this
one
despite
being
a
sipper
its
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
are
very
good
i
wish
there
was
just
a
hint
more
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
but
i
wont
count
that
against
it
since
its
supposed
to
be
sweet
or
a
dessert
beer
as
it
says
on
the
bottle
drinkability
is
good
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
sweetness
isnt
overpowering
and
alcohol
is
nothing
but
a
faint
note
d
slowly
enjoyed
this
one
myself
nice
beer
first
i
have
had
of
this
style
i
like
it
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
style
which
i
am
not
familiar
with
and
trying
to
give
this
the
benefit
of
a
doubt
it
certainly
is
interesting
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
cant
really
say
that
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
im
a
fan
a
barleywines
and
im
a
fan
of
sweet
ales
and
in
fact
had
a
bit
of
a
desire
for
one
tonight
which
is
why
i
broke
this
one
out
but
this
just
is
not
doing
it
for
me
my
first
full
serving
of
braggot
meh
moderate
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
no
complaints
there
drinkability
may
hamper
some
peoples
outlook
as
the
beer
is
very
sweet
and
very
boozy
i
submit
that
i
will
likely
be
done
after
drinking
this
one
4
p
m
on
a
sunday
afternoon
really
a
very
enjoyable
beer
delicious
and
perhaps
its
simplicity
is
an
asset
rather
than
a
hindrance
this
beer
is
surprisingly
good
it
does
indeed
have
qualities
of
both
a
barleywine
and
a
braggot
and
i
heartily
recommend
it
d
although
there
are
some
negatives
going
on
here
this
beer
has
its
good
points
the
look
and
aroma
are
quite
nice
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
get
used
to
the
sweetness
in
the
flavor
i
enjoyed
this
but
this
wasnt
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
when
i
pour
a
braggot
maybe
my
buddies
have
it
all
wrong
when
they
brew
it
but
they
tend
to
get
their
sweetness
from
a
robust
honey
flavor
rather
than
what
is
going
on
here
still
no
problem
clearing
this
bomber
and
i
wouldnt
mind
sharing
a
bottle
of
this
with
someone
else
in
the
future
not
bad
brother
adam
i
held
onto
this
good
looking
maine
beer
for
a
couple
of
months
since
i
was
so
excited
for
it
and
waiting
for
a
special
occassion
to
drink
it
unfortunately
it
fell
a
little
short
ruby
translucent
in
appearance
aroma
of
sweet
honey
grape
juice
caramel
malts
taste
of
alcohol
sour
liquorice
and
a
lingering
burntness
mouthfeel
is
quite
dry
and
acidic
overall
a
lackluster
taste
and
quite
strong
a
lot
of
winequalities
here
this
2005
bottle
aged
at
and
purchased
at
the
brewery
in
bar
harbor
was
opened
and
sampled
by
me
and
a
friend
on
111208
the
liquid
was
a
clear
amber
color
in
our
glasses
with
minimal
white
head
the
retention
was
weak
and
the
lacing
spotty
but
it
was
also
so
old
i
suppose
that
was
to
be
expected
the
aroma
was
semisweet
and
complex
various
malts
and
spices
along
with
ripened
fruit
sweet
esters
and
honey
the
flavors
were
full
of
honey
cinnamon
vanilla
oak
apples
and
a
general
spiciness
along
with
hints
of
citrus
the
carbonation
was
soft
the
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
slightly
oily
the
body
medium
for
nearly
12
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
experience
complex
and
festive
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
ever
tried
and
worth
aging
pleasing
sweet
barleywine
flavor
poured
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
brother
adams
pours
a
deep
hazy
chestnut
with
a
rocky
white
head
that
leaves
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
honey
with
just
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
some
definite
notes
of
fusels
as
it
warms
the
flavor
is
big
and
boozy
there
is
a
nice
base
sweetness
that
im
guessing
comes
from
all
the
honey
thats
used
in
its
production
there
are
also
notes
of
vanilla
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
green
apple
the
one
negative
in
the
beer
is
that
the
11
8
abv
really
shows
through
its
really
boozy
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
different
then
anything
else
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
it
has
an
understated
creaminess
about
it
full
bodied
and
creamy
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
wish
i
had
bought
another
bottle
to
let
it
sit
for
a
couple
more
years
and
see
what
would
happen
to
it
somewhat
of
a
tough
beer
to
drink
both
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
each
sip
the
bottle
recommends
sipping
the
beer
and
so
do
i
best
served
in
a
glass
for
sipping
like
a
snifter
id
say
try
it
for
yourself
drinkability
a
good
representation
of
the
style
one
bomber
bottle
is
enough
for
one
session
though
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavors
are
decent
and
unique
but
can
easily
be
overwhelming
drinkability
is
good
nicely
balanced
and
enjoyable
this
is
nicely
mellowed
out
and
meshed
together
and
im
enjoying
it
more
than
i
do
other
braggots
that
ive
tried
good
stuff
this
is
my
first
braggot
and
i
just
dont
see
it
being
a
style
i
could
get
into
im
not
a
huge
barleywine
fan
either
but
at
least
they
are
more
interesting
and
typically
hoppier
than
this
still
i
did
find
this
starting
to
wear
on
me
a
bit
maybe
because
of
the
nearly
12
alcohol
its
still
a
slow
sipper
but
its
not
too
bad
m
d
medium
but
solid
body
minimal
carbonation
almost
going
so
far
as
to
say
none
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
as
it
warms
the
spiciness
picks
up
nice
stuff
notes
from
102005
the
aroma
has
honey
with
malt
and
yeast
the
appearance
is
amberredbrown
with
a
thin
head
the
flavor
is
funky
up
front
with
a
nice
aftertaste
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
interesting
but
not
great
this
is
a
must
try
because
the
style
is
interesting
but
there
are
better
things
to
drink
out
there
what
this
has
taught
me
is
that
people
back
in
olden
times
were
pretty
messed
up
maybe
its
perplexing
muted
intensity
would
be
better
served
by
letting
it
age
a
bit
but
whatever
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
id
be
willing
to
try
it
again
drinkability
a
good
beer
and
my
first
braggot
nice
one
to
break
in
to
the
style
with
alcohol
is
prohibitively
high
enough
that
one
of
these
is
definitely
enough
but
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
experience
great
balance
of
spices
malty
tastes
and
other
fruity
notes
a
very
complex
and
interesting
brew
i
am
not
impressed
at
all
but
will
keep
my
second
bottle
for
a
couple
of
years
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
little
more
right
now
a
forgettable
experience
but
i
am
glad
i
finally
had
a
chance
to
taste
a
braggot
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
interesting
style
it
seems
to
lack
some
of
the
traditional
beer
flavors
that
come
from
malts
and
hops
this
seems
more
related
to
a
mead
than
a
beer
but
its
a
tasty
beverage
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
the
taste
is
quite
flat
not
overly
syrupy
which
is
a
good
thing
and
a
combination
of
a
very
strong
mead
a
barley
wine
and
a
spiced
beer
this
isnt
the
most
enjoyable
or
drinkable
beer
on
the
rack
the
high
abv
is
quite
pronounced
from
the
nose
and
throughout
the
ba
descriptor
labels
this
as
a
medieval
concoction
and
i
guess
i
can
envision
it
on
a
cold
damp
night
bedded
down
in
a
castle
in
the
northern
climes
this
stuff
would
warm
the
cockles
it
would
also
kill
any
residual
bacteria
in
the
water
used
to
brew
it
which
was
an
important
consideration
then
to
modern
sensibilities
this
is
just
a
really
strong
potent
honey
barley
wine
that
has
a
big
palate
and
a
throaty
burn
on
the
way
down
the
good
news
is
that
it
is
less
cloyingly
sweet
and
less
syrupy
than
most
other
barley
wines
it
is
plenty
sweet
though
an
interesting
one
to
have
as
a
sweet
dessert
pretty
sippable
for
the
high
abv
im
beginning
to
feel
a
bit
better
about
brother
adams
bragget
honey
ale
as
the
ounces
slip
by
actually
thats
probably
the
11
8
abv
talking
another
few
ounces
and
ill
be
feeling
charitably
toward
everyone
and
everything
since
this
is
the
highest
rated
braggot
on
the
site
i
guess
im
just
not
a
fan
thanks
sudsdog
d
drinkability
was
ok
a
very
thin
palate
and
spicy
alcohol
fusels
may
hinder
things
a
bit
but
it
does
get
better
deeper
into
the
drink
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
of
tan
head
which
practically
vanished
before
my
eyes
dark
amber
shade
to
this
brew
aroma
is
sweet
like
most
barleywines
but
this
one
seems
to
be
tempered
a
bit
probably
due
to
the
honey
with
alcohol
pervasive
as
expected
flavor
is
follows
the
nose
with
a
sweet
taste
upfront
followed
by
the
alcohol
which
seems
to
have
the
ride
smoothed
by
the
honey
character
nice
effect
as
a
result
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
the
drinkability
is
enhanced
by
the
interesting
traits
of
this
brew
making
you
come
back
again
to
make
sure
you
enjoyed
it
from
all
angles
brother
adams
bragget

pours
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
sweet
aroma
some
fruit
is
noticeable
the
flavor
is
kind
of
fruity
and
defininitely
on
the
sweet
side
there
is
kind
of
a
slick
mouthfeel
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
a
bit
noticeable
hops
arent
noticeable
at
all
interesting
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
drinkability
unique
and
fairly
interesting
for
some
a
good
night
cap
for
others
its
a

withpizza
beverage
i
really
like
this
beer
i
was
hesitant
to
pick
this
up
for
a
long
time
because
i
didnt
know
much
about
it
im
glad
i
looked
into
it
and
grabbed
a
bottle
since
it
was
a
worthy
investment
and
a
real
treat
this
is
a
sipping
beer
if
i
had
a
fireplace
and
a
comfortable
chair
i
would
be
all
set
drinkability
a
very
unusual
brew
that
is
an
enjoyable
sipper
kudos
to
the
brewery
for
attempting
the
style
d
thanks
to
barleywinebrewer
for
the
chance
to
try
this
unique
to
me
beverage
ill
look
for
more
of
this
style
in
the
future
quite
a
tasty
mix
of
alemead
and
one
that
leverages
the
strength
of
each
without
the
negatives
tasty
and
super
smooth
send
me
some
more
body
is
near
medium
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
and
very
light
carbonation
a
decent
brew
but
probably
not
worth
the
price
this
beer
is
certainly
a
sipper
as
you
can
easily
feel
the
alcohol
taste
in
your
mouth
its
a
style
that
isnt
done
very
often
but
im
glad
that
atlantic
does
it
right
i
am
a

recommended
a

too
mild
in
flavor
to
go
back
to
but
by
no
means
unpleasant
having
just
recovered
from
a
nice
summer
flu
i
felt
it
was
appropriate
to
cut
through
the
residual
haze
with
this
tried
this
for
the
first
time
on
a
memorable
ski
trip
many
years
ago
while
also
drinking
bombers
of
handlabeled
dfh
90
minute
overall
this
had
to
be
one
of
the
most
interesting
brews
i
have
ever
tried
came
off
to
me
more
of
a
spiced
wine
then
a
beer
but
it
was
unique
for
sure
a
bit
hot
and
full
of
alcohol
but
ot
had
a
presence
and
a
flavor
that
i
had
not
expierence
before
and
i
always
appreciate
that
overall
i
would
put
this
down
as
one
you
should
definatly
give
a
try
to
it
was
original
and
worth
a
look
d
this
beer
is
way
hot
they
say
it
can
age
for
years
and
i
believe
it
i
would
recommend
all
potential
drinkers
to
store
this
one
away
for
years
to
let
it
mellow
the
alcohol
flavors
were
way
to
rambunctious
and
need
to
chill
the
hell
out
i
hate
to
give
this
beer
a
bad
review
since
i
know
with
some
years
under
its
belt
it
could
be
something
specialbut
in
its
current
state
its
not
not
a
bad
brew
i
paid
8
99
for
a
22oz
and
might
be
tempted
to
buy
another
it
doesnt
make
the
taste
buds
scream
wow
and
this
will
not
be
the
last
one
i
have
it

a
place
in
my

from
now
on
if
you
enjoy
the
wonderful
aftertaste
of
a
good
barreled
spirit
as
well
as
the
tingle
on
the

i
would
definitely
try
to
get
some
of
this

sip

the

doesnt
give
notice
to
the
big

feel
and
nicely
alcoholic
finnish
the
color
is
that
of

the

that
is
added
gives
this
barley
wine
a
body
that
i
havent
experienced
before
this
is
thick
stuff
not
a

the

to

ill

its

i

the
olfactory
senses
start
is
sweet
rich
in
malt
and
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
finish
is
idoneous
in
its
acidity
with
a
modicum
of
hops
the
alcohol
moliminous
a
true
belly
warmer
this
hybrid
whether
it
be
mead
or
strong
old
ale
or
barley
wine
i
care
not
i
care
that
my
good
friend
bennybrew
doth
send
it
to
me
to
be
enjoyed
with
gusto
and
this
task
has
been
accomplished
f
brought
this
back
from
my
summer
vacation
to
bar
harbor
me
in
june
where
i
also
got
a
very
nice
tour
of
the
atlantic
brewery
i
decided
to
share
it
with
some
homebrewing
friends
last
night
my
particular
serving
came
in
a
22
oz
bottle
that
had
been
aged
since
november
2000
it
poured
smoothly
and
seemed
slightly
thicker
than
normal
there
was
no
head
and
in
fact
the
beer
itself
was
very
lightly
carbonated
it
had
a
delicious
sweet
honey
aroma
no
hops
aroma
noticeable
at
all
the
flavor
was
also
sweet
with
a
very
noticeable
alchohol
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
full
but
no
effervesence
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
im
glad
i
had
some
friends
to
share
it
with
if
i
drank
one
of
these
22
oz
bottles
all
by
myself
you
could
stick
a
fork
in
me
id
be
done
i
made
two
mistakes
with
this
beer
first
seeing
the
bottle
said
to
sip
it
556
this
brew
has
been
aged
since
november
of
2000
so
im
expecting
something
good
the
label
has
a
black
and
white
photo
of
some
knavish
character
it
actually
gave
me
a
chuckle
the
beer
itself
has
the
look
of
cider
only
slightly
more
reddish
this
is
accompanied
by
a
syrupy
honey
smell
the
unique
honey
aspect
serves
well
enjoyably
the
high
alcohol
content
comes
across
smooth
and
not
too
overwhelming
what
i
love
is
the
honey
coating
you
can
feel
on
your
mouth
minutes
after
the
swallow
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
heartwarming
mixture
this
heavyweight
ale
pours
with
a
deep
amberbrown
color
and
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
light
and
cidery
with
hints
of
alcohol
the
initial
sweetness
and
sugary
malt
flavor
is
paired
with
an
apparent
bitterness
and
a
mellow
smoothness
to
the
body
the
alcohol
warmth
gives
the
brew
quite
a
kick
nice
brew
for
winter
sampled
from
a
22
oz
bomber
small
gold
sticker
says
aged
since
november
2000
fairly
dark
brown
brew
with
very
little
off
white
foam
the
foam
vanishes
almost
instantly
very
rich
sweet
malt
and
honey
stick
out
big
in
the
aroma
along
with
an
alcohol
smell
smooth
mouthfeel
with
rather
low
carbonation
the
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
with
lots
of
sweetness
from
both
malt
and
honey
a
good
bit
of
dark
dried
fruit
flavor
prune
and
raisin
in
this
one
also
the
flavor
character
overall
reminds
me
of
a
nice
tawny
port
i
think
this
would
go
great
with
a
chocolatey
dessert
or
a
good
cigar
nicely
warming
alcohol
feeling
as
it
goes
down
this
stuff
is
really
good
for
slow
sipping
on
a
cold
and
rainy
fall
day
like
today
the
alcohol
is
very
subtle
for
a
barley
wine
this
brew
is
smooth
and
has
extra
fermentables
via
the
honey
cheers
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
so
it
started
off
right
but
the
taste
no
honey
big
sour
note
and
i
can
get
a
hint
of
booze
as
well
a
nice
try
though
overall
for
my
first
braggot
there
is
a
good
balance
of
honey
and
beer
characteristics
an
unusual
style
that
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
which
qualities
are
true
to
the
style
a
decent
enough
shotgun
marriage
of
beer
and
mead
the
honeys
complexity
rock
on
southern
alberta
apiaries
outshining
the
base
malt
no
big
loss
throughout
im
just
a
little
hardpressed
to
avoid
comparisons
to
that
bottom
shelf
denizen
malt
liquor
the
florals
and
elevated
alcohol
making
it
oh
so
hard
not
to
at
least
that
parts
mostly
in
my
head
i
think
o
this
is
my
first
braggot
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
enjoy
it
i
expect
that
others
are
more
complex
but
luna
de
miel
is
a
very
pleasant
straightforward
ale
i
could
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
glasses
of
this
on
a
hot
day
what
better
way
to
celebrate
the
interim
between
the
two
nfl
conference
championship
games
than
with
a
braggot
amiright
this
one
pours
a
clear
ambergarnet
topped
by
several
fingers
of
fizzy
sandy
tan
foam
the
nose
is
awash
in
light
dank
raspberries
though
some
traces
of
dark
greens
and
very
mild
toffee
peek
through
small
peepholes
at
random
minute
intervals
the
taste
follows
suit
though
the
greens
and
toffee
are
replaced
by
honey
and
very
light
apple
cider
granny
smith
in
this
case
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
airy
finish
overall
a
crisp
semirefreshing
braggot
though
its
a
bit
onedimensional
and
effervescent
for
me
to
really
place
any
special
significance
on
it
o
not
a
great
braggot
but
still
pretty
good
i
commend
bbc
for
stretching
their
legs
a
bit
and
experimenting
with
this
one
pours
a
clear
dull
pink
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offpink
color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
slight
pale
malt
slight
grain
slight
metallic
offraspberry
and
slight
honey
fits
the
style
of
a
braggot
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
offraspberry
juice
slight
metallic
slight
sweet
malt
slight
grain
slight
pale
malt
and
slight
honey
overall
the
raspberry
flavor
is
metallic
and
barely
reminiscent
of
actual
raspberry
flavor
it
is
a
really
sweet
beer
and
is
a
good
summer
beer
while
sitting
outside
just
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
d
not
sure
on
the
abv
of
this
one
but
the
alcohol
wasnt
very
noticeable
pretty
tasting
and
interesting
ive
had
meades
before
but
this
braggot
combines
the
two
worlds
of
meade
and
beer
this
is
a
nice
desert
style
wine
pretty
easy
to
drink
solid
job
on
the
part
of
bbc
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
dark
pinkreddish
color
with
about
an
inch
colalike
carbonated
light
pink
head
head
retention
is
good
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
raspberries
honey
and
red
wine
for
some
reason
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
drinking
some
boones
farm
stuff
im
not
sure
if
thats
a
good
sign
or
not
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
its
more
sweet
than
it
is
winelike
although
the
wine
taste
is
still
noticable
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
syrupy
the
carbonation
is
very
strong
at
first
but
it
does
smooth
out
as
the
beer
warms
drinkability
is
decent
a
smaller
glass
of
this
at
bbc
wouldnt
be
bad
but
a
750
ml
bottle
of
this
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
brew
its
the
first
braggot
ive
tried
and
i
would
try
one
again
ill
have
to
get
this
on
tap
the
next
time
i
go
to
bbc
for
someone
who
is
into
this
a
second
glass
would
be
good
i
liked
it
but
prefer
other
styles
an
interesting
beerbraggotmeade
never
had
this
style
before
but
after
enjoying
lindemans
framboise
lambic
i
figured
there
was
no
harm
in
giving
another
raspberry
flavored
beer
a
chance
definitely
something
to
try
on
a
warm
summer
evening
paired
well
with
the
spinach
artichoke
dip
and
the
chicken
salad
sandwich
notes
from
122206
had
this
off
the
draft
at
the
brewpub
served
in
a
tall
wine
glass
beautiful
magenta
color
it
was
described
as
a
sweet
honey
meade
made
with
fresh
raspberries
the
smell
was
not
very
strong
but
was
primarily
of
raspberry
the
taste
came
on
quick
and
tart
almost
entirely
of
raspberry
and
left
the
palette
fast
it
was
kind
of
watereddown
tasting
and
not
extremely
flavorful
really
kind
of
what
you
would
imagine
raspberry
juice
water
and
the
warmth
of
alcohol
to
be
like
though
it
wasnt
bad
and
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
few
glasses
i
havent
had
many
meades
but
most
of
the
ones
ive
had
have
been
aged
for
at
least
five
years
or
just
simply
a
more
massive
beer
e
g
midas
touch
by
dogfish
head
however
i
did
have
a
freshly
brewed
meade
at
cumberland
brews
in
louisville
about
3
weeks
ago
and
it
also
did
not
have
this
massive
flavor
just
a
different
experience
still
good
i
do
prefer
a
bigger
flavor
though
d
a
nice
mead
but
this
doesnt
have
much
in
common
w
braggot
imo
it
really
has
no
spice
flavor
and
the
honey
sweetness
is
there
but
more
raspberry
than
anything
else
it
is
drinkable
but
i
would
probably
stick
to
one
in
an
evening
unless
you
like
the
carbonated
fruit
flavoring
the
fruit
tastes
fine
not
artificial
w
a
honeydrenched
effect
i
consider
it
better
than
avg
yet
it
somehow
fell
short
of
my
expectations
compared
to
other
meads
i
could
probalby
handle
more
than
5oz
of
this
considering
the
dubbel
was
served
in
an
8oz
glass
and
has
02
higher
abv
w
more
flavor
i
could
appreciate
this
as
a
dessert
drink
i
guess
i
have
mixed
emotions
about
this
meade
while
a
delicious
drink
its
kind
of
hard
to
have
several
wines
in
one
sitting
for
me
definitely
plan
on
having
this
again
but
i
cant
see
having
more
than
one
per
sitting
that
said
i
did
enjoy
it
enough
to
purchase
a
bottle
from
the
brewery
but
bob
know
when
ill
get
around
to
drinking
a
bomber
of
this
stuff
good
but
rich
so
the
drinkability
is
somewhat
limited
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
syrupy
with
lots
of
honey
clinging
to
the
tongue
this
really
is
more
of
a
fruit
wine
than
a
beer
its
body
and
appearance
remind
me
of
a
blushrose
wine
the
smell
is
very
fruity
and
with
hints
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
what
solidified
this
as
a
berry
wine
it
was
very
clean
and
dry
there
were
absolutly
not
bitter
values
at
all
and
the
beverage
drank
like
a
desert
wine
the
mouth
feel
was
thin
and
the
carbonation
was
fizzy
like
champagne
the
on
this
one
is
high
so
a
glass
will
do
its
not
a
bad
drink
but
not
a
good
beer
so
to
speak
if
i
were
wanting
a
sparkling
wine
this
would
be
very
very
good
this
one
pours
a
red
color
with
very
little
head
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
i
like
the
color
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
honey
notes
underneath
of
a
raspberry
sweetness
very
soft
and
light
on
the
palate
raspberries
come
through
strong
with
the
honey
flavors
lurking
in
the
back
quite
tasty
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
a
7
brew
a
captivating
beverage
would
be
a
nice
break
from
beer
if
there
were
such
a
thing
upon
the
first
glance
it
looks
like
raspberry
koolaid
or
a
bit
of
a
homemade
wine
with
no
carbonation
and
a
thin
clear
appearance
the
aromas
are
all
of
tart
and
sweet
raspberries
perhapse
more
of
an
extract
than
the
actual
fruit
to
the
taste
its
mostly
of
sweet
and
tart
raspberries
with
an
underlying
honey
sweetness
thats
all
pure
and
clean
not
quite
cloying
but
very
sweet
thinned
and
heated
by
the
alcohol
provides
a
subtle
complexity
that
can
be
enjoyed
its
worth
a
try
but
playtime
is
over
back
to
the
beers
if
i
had
known
what
style
of
beer
this
was
i
probably
would
not
have
purchased
it
i
didnt
bother
to
read
the
label
it
was
simply
the
last
beer
i
needed
to
get
a
discount
i
figured
its
in
a
big
bottle
from
a
brewery
ive
heard
of
and
tasted
before
and
it
was
the
last
one
i
simply
must
have
it
i
cant
wait
to
find
some
to
share
at
a
family
party
in
place
of
champaigne
very
tasty
and
dangerously
drinkable
delicate
and
so
smooth
on
the
palate
this
one
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
what
a
surprise
to
find
this
on
tap
at
the
bluegrass
brewing
company
the
meade
pours
a
deep
opaque
red
color
there
is
a
bit
of
carbonation
bubbling
in
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
mix
of
honey
sweetness
and
raspberry
tartness
the
meade
has
the
flavor
of
honey
with
just
enough
of
the
tartness
of
the
raspberry
it
feels
rather
thick
in
my
mouth
not
too
unexpected
with
the
style
this
finishes
dry
and
crisp
its
a
good
way
to
round
out
a
good
meal
at
the
bbc
but
one
is
definately
enough
with
its
high
abv
the
beer
doesnt
look
like
anything
special
its
a
slightly
hazy
deep
reddish
colored
brew
with
very
little
head
but
plenty
of
apparent
carbonation
in
the
body
though
certainly
not
fizzy
smell
is
rich
full
of
sweet
florals
and
some
tart
raspberry
the
flavor
is
tart
with
the
raspberry
flavor
dominating
however
the
honey
balances
the
tartness
well
while
adding
an
impressive
twist
to
the
flavor
the
tartness
hits
fullforce
initially
and
the
sweet
honey
comes
in
in
the
middle
for
balance
and
closes
with
a
dry
sweet
finish
a
smooth
brew
with
carbonation
and
alcohol
producing
a
slightly
warm
and
rough
feel
in
the
mouth
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
not
too
tart
not
at
all
syrupy
a
very
good
ale
when
you
want
a
change
from
your
norm
decent
head
which
crests
over
a
finger
mostly
larger
bubbles
so
doesnt
persist
that
long
pleasingly
orangish
tan
color
the
lacing
forms
thick
streaks
however
these
too
arent
long
for
this
world
rich
amber
red
color
bright
shine
to
it
lots
of
large
and
swiftly
moving
bubbles
big
brash
nose
of
honey
candied
orange

and
caramel

what
it
does
best
lighter

textural
thickness
has
it
glued
to
your
nostrils
for
some
time
fullbodied
the
carbonation
is
working
overtime
but
not
going
to
match
the
layered
power
and
heaviness
it
presents
more
mineral
to
metallic
notes
as
well
as
grass
and
bread
crust
still
it
remains
all
about
the
honey
the
orange
citrus
expands
into
white
grapefruit
the
caramel
verges
onto
butterscotch
syrup
and
vanilla
pudding
there
is
a
burnt
touch
like

the

at
the
very
end
you
get
a
fizzy
tickle

come
off
as
boozy
you
feel
the
alcohol
a
very
sweet
in
style
beer
that
likely
is
best
utilized
as
a
dessert
beverage
or
to
counter

a

the

are

nutmeg

to
the
palate
and
there
are
some
peppery

characteristics
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
that
help
clean
up
smooth

with
a
roasty

the

carbonation
is
low
but
more
than
present
it
is
soft
and
lends
a
decent

to
the

a
white
collar
of
bubbles
sweet
malty
aroma
light
stone
fruits
and
herbal
notes
taste
was
pretty
similar
caramel
malts
sweet
corn
honeysuckle
indistinct
stone
fruit
vegetal
stiff
with
dry
booze
yep
this
was
essentially
a
glorified
malt
liquor
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thinned
out
about
lightmedium
in
body
not
much
distinctiveness
or
flavor
not
something
id
go
for
again
nice
drinkability
this
one
has
to
be
drank
slow
due
to
its
thickness
but
it
really
has
a
nice
flavor
overall
and
superb
mouthfeel
alcohol
warming
effects
are
noticable
after
only
a
short
while
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
unique
offering
it
was
a
delightful
and
intriguing
adventure
every
step
of
the
way
wow
this
was
good
perfect
beer
for
cold
weather
so
subtle
and
warming
yet
deceptively
strong
and
intense
you
dont
recognize
its
strength
until
about
ten
minutes
after
you
finish
one
of
the
best
from
pb
another
big
beer
winner
from
tod
and
the
folks
at
pb
the
perfect
beer
for
the
winter
season
imo
944
wasnt
going
to
have
this
because
i
really
didnt
like
the
only
other
braggot
i
had
tried
my
wife
had
one
gave
me
a
taste
and
i
had
to
have
one
of
my
own
served
in
a
snifter
it
was
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
and
some
nice
lacing
it
had
a
sweet
dark
fruity
aroma
a
sweet
honey
taste
with
some
hops
that
just
kept
coming
at
you
very
assertive
but
not
in
your
face
a
definite
hit
try
it
by
all
means
its
a
sin
that
this
was
released
on
the
unwitting
masses
brother
adam
had
better
be
careful
when
travelling
down
this
slippery
slope
light
but
sugary
and
coating
not
a
refreshing
wit
feel
im
at
my
wits
end
with
this
haha
a
wit
infused
with
braggot
this
brew
pours
a
honey
gold
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
hibiscus
tea
honey
pepper
spice
and
herb
in
the
flavor
very
herbal
and
earthy
the
lavender
really
adds
a
depth
to
the
beer
and
undeniable
floral
qualities
for
a
herbedspiced
saison
this
one
is
pretty
enjoyable
everything
is
in
balance
and
its
pretty
well
rounded
hides
the
8
really
well
if
this
were
bottled
i
would
set
a
few
down
for
a
few
years
to
see
what
happens
agreeable
brew
i
should
also
point
out
after
buying
this
bottle
at
the
brewery
and
speaking
with
the
owner
that
many
of
their
22
ounce
bottles
are
made
for
long
storage
due
to
their
high
abv
i
didnt
get
an
exact
number
on
this
beer
but
i
would
imagine
its
up
there
drinkability
is
decent
the
brew
is
drinkable
but
ends
up
a
bit
too
sweet
aside
from
that
enough
flavor
and
a
well
proportioned
profile
make
this
a
welldone
brew
overall
mjod
is
very
cider
like
when
cold
but
leans
more
and
more
toward
the
beer
side
after
a
little
warming
the
honey
is
nearly
fermented
out
with
just
a
little
residual
sweetness
and
fruitiness
i
could
see
this
being
a
drink
that
would
agree
with
a
large
number
of
people
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
something
both
interesting
and
enjoyable
from
the
other
two
braggots
ive
tried
this
was
the
most
drinkable
and
seemingly
true
to
style
winter
white
was
more
like
a
barleywine
and
2
bros
heliocentric
was
like
malt
liquor
with
a
shot
of
honey
thick
mouthfeel
tastes
like
honey
and
spices
different
than
anything
that
i
have
ever
tasted
before
not
bad
not
great
just
different
a
nice
derail
from
the
malthop
dilema
i
would
definately
try
a
braggotbracketmead
again
just
for
kicks
m
d
thinnish
and
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
kind
of
a
sweet
brew
not
one
that
i
think
could
be
real
sessionable
drinkibilityoverall
a
much
better
more
drinkable
complex
and
balanced
braggot
than
their
honey
moon
which
was
a
cloying
mess
d
the
alcohol
seems
high
but
not
confirmed
by
the
bottle
limiting
the
drinkability
although
if
i
were
about
to
initiate
a
viking
raid
on
some
unsuspecting
neighbor
id
probably
want
a
few
of
these
d
although
i
havent
tried
many
meads
i
find
this
one
to
be
enjoyable
the
fizzy
factor
makes
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
but
i
would
buy
this
one
again
copper
appearance
pretty
clear
minimal
white
head
interesting
nose
dusty
and
musty
and
sweet
as
well
caramel
apple
and
grapes
are
all
duely
noted
nice
taste
of
sweetness
blended
with
just
a
touch
of
acidity
which
gives
it
just
a
bit
of
dryness
caramel
riesling
grapes
apple
cider
and
some
doughiness
in
the
middle
carbonation
is
low
which
is
appropriate
i
believe
goes
down
fairly
easily
i
have
not
developed
enough
of
a
baseline
on
meads
to
judge
real
objectively
yet
but
this
tastes
good
so
ill
give
it
good
ratings
clear
caramel
color
with
fine
bubbles
and
no
head
the
scent
is
sweet
and
apply
there
are
also
strong
notes
of
fermented
honey
and
riesling
grapes
the
taste
is
light
and
fruity
light
bodied
with
a
small
amount
of
acid
earthy
less
pungent
and
sickly
than
other
brackets
that
i
have
had
making
this
one
more
drinkable
i
also
pick
up
a
little
bit
of
orange
and
winter
spices
this
is
one
of
the
better
brackets
that
i
have
had
very
drinkable
and
not
too
sweet
for
the
style
meads
have
never
been
nor
ever
will
be
something
i
fine
terribly
drinkably
this
one
fairs
better
than
most
probably
due
to
some
familiar
beer
and
viking
qualities
much
like
vikings
honey
moon
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
maybe
not
quite
as
much
but
theyve
done
quite
well
here
again
if
viking
put
out
a
steady
line
of
meads
and
braggots
they
would
do
quite
well
for
themselves
vas
heill
pours
a
deep
golden
brown
color
completely
transparent
with
no
head
at
all
smell
is
of
honey
but
not
straight
honey
and
somewhat
of
apples
and
extremely
sweet
carmel
cloyingly
sweet
it
will
make
you
not
want
to
drink
it
tart
apple
flavors
are
also
present
if
this
is
a
mead
i
hope
it
is
not
a
very
good
mead
because
there
is
no
chance
i
will
be
finishing
the
rest
of
this
bottle
clear
bright
bronze
color
with
no
head
just
a
ring
of
white
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
of
apples
and
grapes
almost
a
winelike
the
flavor
has
apples
and
a
dark
fruitiness
it
is
a
bit
woody
in
the
flavor
as
well
it
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with
a
finish
that
is
sweet
then
immediately
dry
i
can
tell
that
this
beer
is
up
there
in
the
alcohol
as
well
a
very
interesting
beverage
i
would
like
to
try
other
meads
look
at
tavernjefs
effort
for
a
better
assessment
of
the
taste
cranberry
chestnut
color
head
dies
quickly
after
the
pour
essentially
a
transparent
beverage
no
real
lacing
on
the
glass
fruity
somewhat
winelike
aroma
like
an
arbor
mist
or
something
orangish
flavor
to
start
out
apple
takes
hold
on
further
sips
as
well
as
burnt
raisin
tones
lending
a
sandy
texture
to
the
essentially
undercarbonated
mouthfeel
gets
a
barklike
feel
close
to
the
swallow
the
finish
and
aftertaste
is
quininelike
catches
the
throat
and
bitters
like
an
oldfashioned
horehound
cough
drop
or
like
rolling
apple
seeds
around
in
your
mouth
an
odd
combination
of
sweetness
in
a
honey
sense
and
a
countermeasure
that
i
describe
above
i
cant
really
ding
a
style
like
this
but
its
not
a
drink
i
would
especially
seek
out
again
taste
is
a
whole
nother
story
with
soft
lightly
playing
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
with
sweet
dark
honey
white
grapes
and
peels
has
a
soft
carbonation
with
a
few
sparkling
wine
characteristics
that
poke
through
but
over
all
seems
dulled
in
complexity
and
the
subtlities
are
amazing
it
goes
all
over
the
place
as
far
as
the
mouthfeel
starts
smooth
and
thin
of
very
dull
dark
grapes
and
honey
then
takes
a
turn
with
a
quick
winelike
zip
that
fades
right
back
to
more
dulled
smooth
thinness
and
finishes
with
more
winelike
tendencies
again
showing
in
through
some
moderate
throat
tingly
biting
thats
a
bit
undesirable
and
makes
it
hard
to
really
enjoy
for
me
take
a
dark
dry
wine
throw
in
some
champagne
and
some
honey
and
i
think
this
is
what
you
might
get
very
strange
stuff
reminded
alot
of
dfh
midas
touch
but
not
nearly
as
drinkable
although
i
may
not
have
it
again
its
a
definate
conversational
sipperdessert
drink
not
a
bad
meadbraggot
has
a
decent
flavour
profile
if
the
aroma
were
bolstered
and
the
body
didnt
resemble
carbonated
fruit
juice
that
would
really
improve
the
overall
impression
the
flavour
of
the
honey
and
blueberries
is
actually
surprisingly
refreshing
but
overall
the
complete
package
could
be
improved
still
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
definitely
pick
up
both
on
the
honey
and
blueberry
character
and
they
offer
an
interesting
compliment
to
each
other
drinkability
its
very
smooth
but
accompanied
by
bland
flavors
and
aromas
bottle
poured
a
light
blueish
color
mead
which
is
very
still
aroma
of
gross
blueberry
notes
with
overly
sweet
ester
taste
is
absolutely
atrocious
with
no
balance
and
gross
notes
with
blueberries
barely
standing
out
i
dont
recall
having
tasted
such
a
bad
mead
in
my
life
my
buddy
homebrewed
mead
is
better
than
this
crap
o
hard
to
open
cage
and
cork
the
cage
was
of
tough
wire
much
tougher
than
all
belgians
ive
had
and
the
cork
broke
off
leaving
me
to
use
a
knife
to
finish
the
job
when
finally
unplugged
an
explosion
of
purple
filled
the
room
ceiling
to
shirt
to
floor
hence
the
quincys
roll
smell
in
the
room
on
my
wifes
entrance
however
really
unique
my
first
in
this
style
so
i
dont
have
any
to
compare
it
to
but
look
forward
to
trying
more
final
grade
3
42
a
b
trafalgars
lanark
blueberry
mead
didnt
blow
me
away
but
its
still
one
of
the
better
products
ive
had
from
them
with
no
other
braggots
under
my
belt
to
compare
this
one
to
this
review
is
basically
just
a
subjective
opinion
so
to
boil
it
down
id
say
this
one
is
worth
at
least
one
try
if
youre
a
fruit
wine
fan
or
otherwise
curious
the
price
is
fine
if
you
compare
it
to
a
similar
volume
of
wine
something
more
suited
to
a
hot
summer
day
than
a
rainy
april
one
but
an
interesting
diversion
nonetheless
and
one
of
the
few
things
in
the
trafalgar
portfolio
id
be
interested
in
trying
again
overall
a
tasty
foray
into
the
world
of
mead
however
i
find
this
too
winelike
to
satisfy
my
beer
cravings
nice
use
of
blueberry
though
closer
too
wine
than
beer
could
probably
only
drink
one
or
2
seams
like
it
could
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
food
with
if
you
have
the
knowledge
of
pairing
why
does
this
make
me
type
a
novel
to
ruin
the
short
and
sweetness
of
it
take
my
comment
bottle
poured
a
bright
golden
color
mead
with
a
fizzy
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
honey
notes
with
loads
of
peach
notes
is
not
as
bad
i
was
expecting
taste
is
actually
quite
enjoyable
with
some
good
notes
of
peach
with
some
honey
notes
and
residual
sugars
there
is
some
unrefined
notes
but
subtle
enough
to
not
mess
with
this
mead
the
taste
just
did
not
do
anything
for
me
the
honey
sweetness
was
rejected
by
the
floral
bitterness
in
other
words
they
did
not
mix
together
well
i
found
myself
wincing
from
time
to
time
because
the
flavors
were
too
opposite
of
each
other
rather
than
complimenting
each
other
not
a
drain
pour
i
promise
but
it
was
slow
to
finish
honey
and
hops
is
an
interesting
idea
but
the
honey
is
the
forefront
on
this
one
strange
balance
backwards
by
my
judgement
sink
dump
whump
whump
fullish
in
body
the
taste
of
hops
and
alcohol
offer
strong
reprieve
from
the
malt
and
honey
with
dryness
spiciness
and
heat
all
its
own
acetonerich
to
close
the
roughness
of
alcohol
hides
behind
the
bitter
hop
resins
nicely
as
their
linger
of
fruit
and
pine
needle
extend
indefinitely
the
flavor
starts
bitter
and
finishes
sweet
neither
are
extreme
full
bodied
almost
chewy
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
a
spritz
i
like
this
combination
of
flavors
this
is
not
as
cloy
as
most
braggots
definitely
worth
trying
this
is
definitely
interesting
but
doesnt
feel
all
that
much
like
a
braggot
because
the
mead
aspect
is
not
that
prominent
beyond
the
simple
honey
presence
