o
awesome
beer
could
drink
lots
of
pints
of
this
i
really
like
this
way
of
balancing
a
malty
beer
though
maybe
the
bitterness
is
just
slightly
too
much
for
me
great
as
a
session
ale
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
it
would
make
for
a
really
nice
choice
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
bitterness
overall
a
light
session
ale
without
noticeable
flaws
quite
good
balance
but
a
bit
simple
and
on
the
sweet
side
overall
a
great
winning
mild
super
drinkable
too
want
a
fresh
one
overall
actually
a
pretty
decent
beer
a
hair
on
the
sweet
side
especially
in
the
aroma
but
generally
quite
good
overall
ok
not
a
favorite
but
not
hated
either
o
mild
but
with
an
array
of
pleasant
flavours
top
quality
english
ale
at
just
4
1
abv
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
brewery
did
a
good
job
in
making
this
one
i
now
know
what
is
meant
by
a
mild
you
get
all
the
flavor
of
the
floral
hops
without
much
by
the
way
of
ibus
its
also
low
on
the
abv
scale
this
one
was
really
nice
in
the
fact
that
although
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
bitterness
it
didnt
become
cloyingly
sweet
nicely
balanced
o
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
real
ales
i
drink
when
i
get
the
chance
to
travel
to
the
uk
mostly
for
business
and
it
has
been
almost
a
year
now
i
find
this
to
be
very
easy
to
drink
sessionable
and
really
enjoyable
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
light
amber
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
covers
the
glass
in
a
fair
amount
of
sticky
lace
smells
malty
bready
with
a
hint
of
butterscotch
and
nail
polish
sweet
dark
pitted
fruit
and
a
hint
of
toffee
round
out
the
nose
quite
well
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
bread
and
toffee
up
front
lots
of
butterscotch
coated
berries
and
cherries
in
here
slightly
earthy
hop
barely
cuts
through
malty
sweetness
surprising
fullness
of
body
for
such
a
small
abv
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
oily
mouthfeel
not
to
shabby
of
a
beer
if
it
were
a
bit
easier
to
obtain
i
might
have
one
periodically
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
a
bit
light
overall
this
would
be
a
grea
session
beer
light
alcohol
content
but
big
time
aroma
and
flavor
if
this
was
available
here
i
would
love
to
try
it
ontap
or
on
cask
for
a
session
solid
beer
o
yes
it
would
be
a
good
session
ale
if
you
wanted
to
put
back
a
few
beers
would
i
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
this
though
not
really
fair
but
certainly
not
the
fairest
in
the
land
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
singlefinger
white
head
and
some
good
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
a
bit
of
diacetyl
and
toffee
as
well
as
some
notes
of
grain
and
a
bit
of
some
floral
hops
the
taste
is
light
bread
and
a
bit
of
toffee
diacetyl
there
but
not
as
much
as
with
the
nose
not
too
too
much
for
the
style
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
not
bad
too
much
diacetyl
for
my
taste
though
it
was
an
acceptable
level
decent
enough
the
beer
is
transparent
and
yellow
hued
with
a
thin
white
cap
the
aroma
is
floral
with
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
the
flavor
brings
a
light
floral
hop
character
as
well
as
a
bready
biscuit
taste
the
feel
is
thin
and
light
bodied
and
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
i
could
throw
back
a
few
pints
of
this
beer
is
thin
i
guess
thats
to
be
expected
and
has
a
late
grainy
bitterness
the
midpalate
is
almost
like
butter
toffee
or
some
thin
caramel
carbonation
is
minimal
in
the
mouth
but
overall
it
is
fine
ive
actually
had
better
english
pale
mild
ales
before
definitely
not
my
favorite
and
id
probably
pass
on
it
in
the
future
o
well
session
beers
arent
really
my
thing
but
this
one
would
certainly
fit
the
bill
the
flavor
is
nice
compared
to
the
smell
it
is
grainy
with
an
herbal
hop
favor
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
int
eh
aftertaste
it
isnt
amazing
but
for
being
subtle
it
is
nice
d
quite
a
nice
beer
very
drinkable
sweetbitter
not
recommended
but
youll
probably
enjoy
it
the
cpj
an
interesting
style
that
is
sessionable
kind
of
surprised
there
arent
more
examples
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
one
that
is
somewhat
harder
to
judge
as
its
so
different
from
what
else
is
generally
available
in
the
u
s
its
a
rare
style
but
one
i
would
like
to
try
again
d
this
was
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
the
low
abv
makes
it
a
great
session
beer
that
you
wont
get
sick
of
d
at
4
1abv
hard
to
argue
about
having
more
alcohol
is
easy
enough
to
manage
and
packs
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
depth
and
maltiness
in
a
modest
package
worth
checking
out
interesting
good
fruit
but
too
sour
dont
know
where
the
cascade
is
has
that
lactic
thing
that
some
hoppy
english
ales
get
perle
hops
malts
anyway
a
bit
underwhelming
a
light
gold
coloured
beer
with
a
significant
slightly
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
fruity
with
hints
of
cherry
and
raisin
an
indistinct
creamy
and
vaguely
sweet
start
gives
way
rapidly
to
dry
herbal
hop
domination
too
dry
to
be
a
session
beer
for
me
d
this
is
highly
drinkable
the
only
thing
that
would
preclude
it
being
a
regular
session
beer
is
the
price
and
unknown
freshness
if
it
were
cheap
and
on
cask
at
my
local
pub
id
get
it
regularly
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
since
it
was
the
last
style
i
needed
but
i
wish
the
beer
would
have
not
had
so
many
flaws
maybe
i
will
get
to
try
it
again
since
i
assume
this
is
not
what
the
brewer
intended
poured

flavorsa
real
nice

note

to

still
the

are
subdued
this
would
be
great
on

for
sureits
sociableand
not
as
modest
as
most
for
the
style
in
my
mind
pours
a
fairly
pale
golden
copper
color
with
some
nice
head
and
nice
lacing
very
clean
aroma
crisp
and
slightly
malty
with
a
very
distinct
english
hop
overtone
fuggles
perhaps
wonderful
taste
a
very
nice
malty
body
not
huge
but
at
just
over
4
its
great
with
a
very
nice
hop
taste
at
the
end
and
in
the
aftertaste
it
goes
down
quite
well
not
necessarily
a
thirst
quencher
with
the
higher
hops
to
malt
ratio
but
still
a
great
brew
i
enjoyed
it
completely
american
brewers
need
to
take
note
from
this
a
huge
flavor
but
very
low
alcohol
this
is
a
wonderful
cask
offering
highly
recommended
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
ale
with
a
light
haze
and
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
floral
cereal
with
light
dry
hops
is
mildly
enjoyable
taste
is
refreshing
and
easily
quaffable
with
notes
of
cereal
with
light
residual
sweetness
and
some
floral
undertones
body
is
slightly
more
full
then
average
with
good
carbonation
limited
character
but
refreshing
notes
makes
this
an
enjoyable
session
beer
simple
but
very
drinkable
ale
contrasts
greatly
with
the
deep
and
dark
lia
fail
from
the
same
brewery
this
is
all
light
and
breezy
with
a
summer
feel
to
the
mouthfeel
and
the
wheaty
taste
to
the
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
a
golden
ale
low
in
abv
but
with
plenty
of
flavour
mouth
feel
wise
its
prickly
with
carbonation
all
the
way
through
but
not
coarse
at
all
there
is
a
slipperyoily
presence
here
too
altogether
this
is
an
exceptional
session
brew
it
is
lively
light
but
firm
in
feel
and
not
remotely
thin
or
watery
lovely
fullflavoured
english
pale
ale
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
if
i
didnt
have
things
to
do
the
next
day
i
would
ahve
had
a
few
more
edit
i
see
this
has
been
reclassified
as
an
english
pale
mild
ale
that
works
for
me
good
job
note
this
was
best
on
the
first
day
seemed
to
sour
easily
on
the
second
day
d
notes
great
session
ale
that
could
be
put
away
all
night
despite
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
brewed
in
scotland
i
dont
think
that
it
has
nearly
enough
malt
character
to
fall
in
the
scottish
ale
category
it
strikes
me
more
as
a
mild
or
a
pale
ale
good
stuff
nonetheless
poured
from
the
500ml

hazy
golden
color
topped
by
a
good
fingers
worth
of
fluffy

much
in
the
way
of
aroma
a
bit
of
sweet
bready
malt
and
a
hint
of
spicy
floral
hops
palate
is
much
more
interesting
a
very
tasty
blend
of
bready
malt
and
spicy
saaz
hops
notes
of
grapefruit
and
white
pepper
are
present
with
a
mild
tartness
on
the
finish
body
is
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
very
nice
for
the
style
finish
is
rather
interesting
as
it
is
a
bit
dry
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
ale
and
with
its
low
alcohol
content
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
if
not
for
the
pricetag
above
4bottle
i
might
drink
it
every
day
drinkabilitynotes
overall
seems
a
rather
weak
example
of
a
distinguished
style
tingly
but
not
gaseous
overcarbonated
drinkable
but
leaves
an
odd
aftertaste
at
times
this
proved
to
be
a
nice
surprise
i
had
never
heard
of
the
brewery
before
supping
this
very
pleasant
pint
i
would
definately
sample
this
again
should
i
come
accross
it
md
so
lively
3d
structured
and
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
as
well
as
refreshing
tasting
just
great
fresh
on
cask
everyone
else
seems
to
like
this
but
its
not
for
me
its
all
lemons
and
hardly
anything
else
decent
but
wouldnt
buy
again
decent
session
type
beer
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
but
not
overly
strong
or
challenging
a
pretty
decent
ale
id
probably
have
it
again
overall
impression
just
rubbed
me
wrong
hops
werent
enough
to
hold
my
interest
and
too
tea
like
malt
was
ok
but
the
peat

just
didnt
meld

this
was
a
raw

that
i
really
enjoyed
but
that

to
get

ok

a

what

clings

it
is
notable
that
the
minimal

floats
fairly

an
almost
peat
like
aroma
of
malts
with
a
wee
bit
of
flowery
hops
the
taste
is
nice
fairly
earthy
and
grainy
sweetness
with
a
smoky
blast
of
hops
toward
the
finish
nice
smooth
and
rich
mouthfeel
not
too
much
carbonation
not
too
bad
worth
picking
it
up
if
you
see
it
another
delicious
sampling
from
nerax
2003
copper
with
an
orange
hue
and
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
faint
but
with
some
deep
whiffs
pleasing
hoppy
fruity
and
tealike
scents
are
detected
the
biscuity
malt
is
lightly
sweet
and
very
smooth
fruity
flavors
and
citrusy
hops
mix
well
with
the
malt
and
woody
flavors
somewhat
flat
in
a
good
caskconditioned
way
first
thing
that
hit
me
was
the
nutty
aroma
from
my
glass
deep
orange
in
color
with
a
white
head
flavor
profile
was
dominated
by
nuts
and
fruit
with
an
underlying
sweeteness
that
carries
into
the
finish
finish
had
only
a
hint
of
hops
but
not
too
much
for
the
style
very
light
bodied
and
enjoyable
right
now
it
is
august
of
2002
and
the
bottle
had
a
best
before
date
of
august
of
2003
the
one
i
got
was
really
fresh
and
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
matt
give
it
another
chance
and
make
sure
and
check
the
date
mild
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
though
the
latter
are
pretty
tame
very
traditional
kentish
ale
that
you
could
knock
back
the
esters
and
diacetyl
might
get
in
the
way
of
allnight
drinkability
however
mouthfeel
is
silky
hint
of
a
tickle
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
fluffy
in
back
pours
a
hazed
orangeamber
nice
creme
head
nose
is
citric
hops
flavor
is
mild
with
some
hop
characteristics
there
and
a
definite
bitterness
definitely
on
the
earthy
side
somewhat
of
a
grassy
aftertaste
feel
is
about
standard
its
nice
yes
the
obliterated
american
palate
might
not
appreciate
it
so
much
but
its
pretty
decent
md
lightly
carbonated
and
very
lightbodied
this
pale
mild
is
imho
the
best
ive
tried
even
better
than
the
timothy
taylors
golden
best
which
is
tasted
far
away
from
yorkshire
so
no
competition
here
actually
what
a
pale
mild
itd
surprise
you
if
this
beer
style
had
never
occured
in
your
mind
starts
like
a
blonde
ale
but
soon
succumbs
to
a
darker
dry
malt
and
a
bitter
hop
dry
finish
that
lingers
lightly
for
a
long
time
rich
body
with
a
normal
level
of
carbonation
poured
from
cask
into
pint
at
the
brewpub
in
montreal
pours
a
creamy
brown
amber
with
thick
white
creamy
head
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
a
small
bit
of
fruit
taste
is
very
similar
to
aroma
sweet
and
malty
but
crisp
and
a
bit
of
fruity
hop
very
drinkable
and
smooth
low
abv
and
very
easy
to
drink
plus
its
tastey
nice
afternoon
brew
o
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beer
im
happy
to
know
they
usually
have
it
on
cask
since
its
a
spectacular
beer
that
is
usually
overlooked
by
the
general
crowd
because
they
might
think
low
abvless
interesting
the
pregold
box
excursion
continues
with
a
beer
described
by
the
menu
as
an
english
summer
ale
with
wheat
okay
it
pours
a
clear
amberbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlywet
grass
wheat
light
corn
and
a
hint
of
lemon
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
now
the
wheat
is
fuller
and
funkier
and
methinks
i
detect
a
pinch
of
cardamom
the
funkiness
is
offputting
though
not
quite
enough
to
make
me
react
very
viscerally
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
a
decent
little
brew
but
not
something
id
go
for
another
pour
of
any
time
soon
straw
coloured
beer
with
a
decent
white
head
from
bottle
with
freshness
date
eight
months
away
the
nose
is
mostly
lemony
and
perhaps
a
tad
grassy
fresh
lemon
flavour
starting
somewhat
sweetly
but
becoming
more
bitter
increasing
caramel
element
the
more
i
drink
neither
bold
nor
bland
a
decent
refreshing
beer
for
a
rare
warm
summer
evening
like
this
one
o
a
nice
pint
i
can
say
no
more
an
easy
drinking
session
ale
that
is
quite
tasty
and
grows
on
me
as
it
disappears
straightforward
and
not
too
exciting
though
o
a
good
beer
but
rather
boring
not
recommended
i
probably
wouldnt
have
again
still
good
effort
appearance
is
a
light
browndark
amber
not
exactly
pale
but
whatever
there
a
little
foam
around
the
edges
the
aroma
of
herbal
caramel
with
sweet
candylike
british
yeast
character
that
same
candy
comes
off
in
the
flavor
along
with
subtle
biscuit
notes
there
might
be
a
touch
of
diacetyl
but
its
nice
and
goes
well
with
the
ringwoodlike
yeast
a
tasty
session
ale
overall
worth
a
try
overall
really
impressed
me
for
a
mild
big
flavor
and
a
good
session
beer
ill
be
enjoying
this
1
hopefully
for
the
next
few
weeks
this
mild
ale
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
decent
12
inch
head
of
white
foam
it
had
ok
retention
that
left
behind
a
handful
of
white
rings
one
big
white
bubbly
island
and
a
few
spots
of
lace
around
the
glass
faint
to
light
aroma
of
malted
wheat
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
and
a
splash
of
coffee
all
of
these
aroma
were
in
front
of
a
lightly
sour
background
there
wasnt
much
to
the
taste
the
few
things
i
could
detect
were
small
in
size
what
i
could
detect
was
sour
malted
wheat
coffee
bitter
hops
and
a
quick
splash
of
chocolate
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
heavy
dose
of
carbonation
to
it
there
was
that
and
it
had
a
faint
lightly
sour
aftertaste
of
wheat
bitter
hops
and
a
pinch
of
chocoalte
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
ship
inn
has
to
offer
it
was
average
all
the
way
quite
nice
a
crisp
floral
taste
that
would
go
down
well
on
a
hot
day
some
other
badger
beers
that
ive
tried
have
been
disappointingly
flawed
worth
sampling
overall
pleasant
to
drink
and
packs
a
nice
flavor
a
standard
drinkable
beer
but
i
prefer
golden
glory
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
with
the
low
abv
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
highly
enjoyed
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
cask
if
it
is
in
fact
sold
that
way
got
this
tasty
brew
as
a
gift
from
visiting
englishman
vinnie
thanks
man
poured
with
a
nice
head
that
mostly
faded
and
some
lace
clear
gold
color
fresh
hop
character
in
nose
and
flavor
well
balanced
light
body
nice
finish
definitely
a
session
beer
similar
in
some
ways
to
an
american
pale
ale
p
s
i
wonder
which
beers
were
this
ones
competitors
in
the
tesco
brewing
award
competition
that
this
ordinary
product
should
stand
out
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
i
am
a
sucker
for
english
mild
ales
this
one
wasnt
one
of
the
best
but
still
a
good
brew
d
the
best
maltese
beer
ive
tried
for
what
thats
worth
most
drinkable
i
recommend
a
halflitre
in
the
hole
in
the
wall
pub
o
fantastic
session
beer
perfect
english
character
malty
but
not
sweet
hoppy
but
not
bitter
satifying
yet
quaffable
as
far
as
i
know
this
brewery
is
the
only
one
in
the
med
that
brews
ales
and
long
may
it
do
so
it
is
also
one
of
the
reasons
ive
been
on
holiday
to
malta
four
times
pleasant
and
drinkable
overall
it
is
a
very
mediocre
mild
but
one
that
is
eminently
drinkable
and
something
that
you
can
throw
back
quite
a
few
of
in
the
heat
that
malta
can
get
a
cold
lager
is
probably
more
refreshing
but
if
you
are
an
ale
fan
then
this
one
is
a
good
choice
not
one
id
be
inclined
to
have
again
the
beer
lacks
punch
and
body
depth
to
be
honest
ok
but
not
enough
umph
to
make
me
want
another
fruity
aroma
has
a
malty
undertone
not
much
else
pours
a
clear
bright
yellow
with
a
fairly
thick
white
head
flavor
is
a
little
malty
and
a
little
fruity
with
a
weird
varnishlike
hint
texture
is
rather
thin
and
lacking
fizz
overall
not
too
hot
nevertheless
it
is
drinkable
fine
if
nothing
else
is
available
blech
not
a
very
nice
beer
the
flavouraroma
are
dull
and
watery
with
various
unappealing
offnotes
no
aromatic
hop
presence
the
clear
bottle
may
have
played
a
role
in
this
beers
poor
showing
but
i
suspect
its
just
a
bit
shit
not
recommended
spend
your
money
on
something
else
theres
nothing
super
special
about
this
blonde
its
delicate
flavours
are
pleasing
to
my
palate
though
so
im
happy
with
it
very
nice
worth
getting
the
style
is
subject
to
flaws
since
it
is
quite
light
and
some
flaws
do
come
out
too
much
grain
butter
and
sulfur
for
my
liking
just
a
tad
too
many
off
flavors
for
me
doesnt
really
drink
clean
o
a
great
english
ale
slightly
more
body
than
the
amber
let
it
warm
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
poured
with
a
small
to
medium
sized
off
white
head
that
settled
down
to
a
big
island
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
nice
straw
amber
with
lots
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
bread
dough
yeast
and
a
bit
floral
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
nice
balance
between
bitter
sweet
and
tang
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
medium
length
session
beer
not
bad
pours
a
clear
medium
copperamber
color
with
a
small
and
quickly
disappearing
head
leaving
a
circle
of
lacing
in
the
middle
of
glass
scent
is
mostly
of
wheat
with
some
floral
scents
as
well
mixed
with
some
slightly
bitter
malts
taste
is
very
weak
and
dry
has
a
semi
bitter
taste
as
well
im
not
sure
if
this
is
how
the
beer
is
suppose
to
taste
or
if
has
gone
skunky
even
though
there
was
a
decent
sound
when
i
cracked
open
the
bottle
if
this
is
how
the
beer
is
suppose
to
taste
it
is
too
weak
and
taste
is
less
than
appealing
considering
the
price
youd
be
better
off
going
with
a
cheap
macrobrew
than
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
bodied
honey
gold
in
color
with
a
light
white
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aromas
are
both
sweet
and
bitter
it
has
a
real
honey
tea
vibe
going
on
that
is
pretty
appealing
the
flavors
are
pretty
similar
but
a
little
more
bland
there
is
little
flavor
aside
from
tea
leaves
with
a
dash
of
sweet
pale
maltshoney
its
not
too
bad
its
easily
drinkable
and
is
pretty
light
in
body
for
2
99
and
ticking
another
style
it
wasnt
a
bad
pickup
picked
up
a
5l
bottle
at
abes
for
3
poured
a
clear
pale
amber
with
a
short
white
head
overall
its
a
pleasant
session
ale
with
a
creamy
smooth
malt
character
with
a
hint
of
caramel
theres
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
and
mild
bitter
finish
theres
a
light
body
but
its
still
satisfying
and
not
too
watery
considering
the
light
strength
give
this
a
shot
d
high
drinkability
due
to
low
alcohol
and
light
body
highly
quaffable
clear
colden
with
a
slight
white
head
that
shrinks
to
a
skim
fairly
quickly
light
caramel
malt
and
lemon
peel
with
mild
english
hops
mild
and
clean
malty
flavors
with
a
citric
hop
bite
in
the
finish
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
a
good
english
session
ale
atmosphere
is
okay
decent
rich
golden
appearance
with
a
nice
head
nose
doesnt
offer
a
whole
lot
but
is
not
offputting
flavor
also
very
light
just
not
a
whole
lot
to
talk
about
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
o
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
think
i
would
have
this
again
but
nothing
to
scream
about
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
ringwood
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
light
and
grainy
pilsner
malt
flavor
thats
watery
yet
quaffable
its
devoid
of
malt
character
yet
has
a
faint
hop
taste
it
goes
down
easy
with
crisp
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
average
its
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
hot
weather
beer
its
light
and
low
in
alcohol
it
would
be
a
great
session
ale
for
the
hot
months
of
the
year
this
beer
is
a
light
better
then
say
a
bud
but
not
much
there
is
no
aroma
and
the
look
is
very
light
golden
color
the
head
was
there
but
dissipates
quickly
this
starts
with
a
sweet
wheat
tastes
that
finishes
fast
for
a
light
its
ok
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
off
the
tap
this
beer
was
a
bleached
golden
color
the
head
was
onefinger
snowwhite
retained
decently
and
left
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
nonexistent
lame
the
flavors
were
also
weak
hints
of
grain
and
very
light
pale
malt
with
a
semibitter
character
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
miserably
watery
the
body
light
and
the
carbonation
medium
craftbrewed
beerflavored
water
es
una
buena
cerveza
fiel
al
estilo
pale
ale
lo
sorprendente
es
lo
ligeray
digerible
al
gusto
totalmente
refrescante
y
hecha
en
méxico
its
better
on
the
nose
than
on
the
mouth
one
of
the
best
guadalajara
beers
if
not
the
best
brownish
and
transparent
colour
small
lasting
offwhite
head
no
doubt
its
a
pale
ale
but
it
seems
to
be
relatively
modestly
hopped
aroma
includes
biscuits
finish
is
a
little
sweet
a
more
than
decent
alternative
to
your
mexican
lager
nothing
special
but
not
bad
a
notsosanely
categorized
beer
this
is
a
pale
ale
no
foolin
with
a
clear
identity
schism
between
yankee
and
red
coat
regarding
the
booze
alone
props
though
to
the
seamless
integration
discounts
the
given
classification
miiild
theres
nothing
miiild
about
it
anyway
a
decent
ale
flavourful
and
moderately
hopped
worth
the
pesos
that
point
is
beyond
reproach
overall
best
mexican
beer
ive
had
and
nice
to
have
something
different
can
see
how
this
picked
up
a
gold
at
world
beer
cup
2010
overall
not
bad
better
than
pretty
much
anything
else
around
here
decent
english
pale
slight
skunk
but
barely
never
know
how
the
beers
are
treated
here
j
body
is
a
little
thin
finishes
with
a
strange
note
of
metallic
something
or
other
that
doesnt
follow
from
the
ingredients
sessionable
and
decent
but
not
quite
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
glad
minerva
offers
something
outside
of
the
standard
macrolager
fare
but
this
pale
ale
is
definitely
not
up
to
the
caliber
of
their
stout
very
tasty
english
brew
easily
sessionable
opens
up
very
nicely
as
it
warms
up
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
english
ales
the
style
may
seem
boring
to
some
of
the
bas
used
to
bolder
american
ales
however
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
and
very
nice
for
a
session
every
day
brew
highly
recommended
probably
one
of
the
best
regular
ales
brewed
in
mexico
md
light
to
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
a
very
smooth
offering
from
minerva
probably
their
best
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
alternative
to
mexican
macrolagers
overall
a
very
tasty
and
sessional
beer
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
the
lightness
d
i
bought
a
growler
and
will
have
no
problem
finishing
it
this
morning
it
is
a
session
beer
and
fits
the
mold
nicely
i
had
this
on
tap
as
part
of
a
sampler
this
was
one
of
most
disappointing
beers
for
sure
it
actually
looks
really
nice
nice
gold
color
good
retention
the
aroma
is
nice
too
light
but
gives
off
some
decent
hops
the
taste
is
terrible
all
skunk
from
start
to
finish
nothing
redeeming
here
at
all
at
3
5
id
almost
rather
drink
an
american
macro
what
a
great
session
beer
that
taste
like
a
beer
great
yeast
notes
mildly
hopped
but
in
balance
not
astringent
like
some
mild
beers
that
turn
out
watery
this
beer
is
light
in
body
but
throws
a
great
head
it
is
after
all
a
session
beer
great
for
drinking
but
it
really
doesnt
stand
up
to
having
with
a
meal
just
enjoy
one
at
the
bar
faint
brown
to
copper
color
appears
light
gold
with
a
short
white
head
in
my
glass
theres
a
sweet
biscuit
aroma
with
herbal
hops
a
little
more
hops
come
out
in
the
flavor
with
a
fresh
cut
grass
note
the
overall
flavor
here
is
light
but
its
also
delicate
and
relatively
complex
ill
call
this
a
good
session
beer
very
sessionable
at
3
5
and
still
aroma
and
taste
but
skip
it
for
the
pils
aroma
was
both
hoppy
and
malty
orangey
with
a
little
white
head
with
lace
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
fruit
metallic
finish
a
light
mouthfeel
and
prickly
active
carbonation
perhaps
the
weakest
in
their
lineup

reviewed

mild

suprisingly
robust

such
a
low

brew
malt
estery

was
mediocre
and
had
no
real

drinkability
i
must
say
is
good
i
could
easily
drink
this
for
a
session
no
problem
likely
not
for
everyone
but
worthy
of
a
try
its
hard
to
strike
the
balance
between
flavor
and
light
body
as
required
by
the
style
this
version
does
it
well
and
makes
for
an
excellent
session
brew
a
lunchtime
favorite
hazy
golden
color
accompanied
by
a
light
fruity
aroma
and
a
hint
of
hops
balanced
bitterness
but
much
more
than
expected
the
bitterness
lingers
on
the
finish
little
malt
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
as
well
perhaps
due
to
the
lack
of
malt
an
ok
beer
but
not
really
enjoyable
after
having
another
the
cardboard
taste
is
gone
but
some
of
the
other
tastes
arent
as
prominent
also
the
head
is
nonexistant
on
this
one
ill
bump
the
taste

the
appearance
suffered

with

decent
crispness
is
key
to
this
beer
though
it
has
a
nice
flowing
smoothness
to
it
as
well
it
seems
a
little
light
in
the
feel
though
not
too
thin
i
just
wonder
if
it
couldnt
have
a
touch
more
body
d
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
some
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
in
the
taste
but
very
drinkable
would
like
to
have
again
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
is
nice
and
gentle
with
a
slight
hoppy
character
and
a
nice
amount
of
backing
bread
lightly
malted
with
a
sprinkling
of
hops
this
is
nice
and
mellow
and
works
really
well
some
floral
and
herbal
characteristics
linger
throughout
body
is
pretty
light
with
good
carbonation
nice
and
drinkable
this
was
an
enjoyable
brew
that
id
certainly
have
again
beer
is
thin
and
has
a
nice
floral
bitterness
to
it
there
isnt
as
much
yeast
on
the
palate
that
i
expected
from
the
aroma
beer
is
flavorful
and
really
nice
a
hop
forward
pale
mild
from
england
im
super
impressed
id
have
this
again
if
it
were
available
to
me
a
very
exciting
beer
in
my
opinion
d
my
first
beer
of
this
style
i
rather
enjoyed
this
note
fairly
ridiculous
that
this
at
4
7
is
a
pale
mild
while
castle
rock
harvest
a
nearly
identical
beer
at
3
8
is
an
english
bitter
many
english
beers
need
style
help
on
ba
a
summer
beer
and
a
good
one
to
boot
hazed
pilsneryellow
with
a
fizzy
soapy
white
head
that
doesnt
retain
particularly
well
pleasantly
sharp
and
pilsneresque
in
the
aroma
as
well
bright
with
noble
lemony
hops
white
wine
faint
lime
and
lemongrass
and
even
fainter
honey
on
the
palate
it
is
clean
and
crisp
perhaps
a
bit
too
light
but
nice
and
zesty
with
quite
citric
hops
in
fact
this
is
almost
like
american
lemonade
quite
bitter
for
such
a
light
mouthfeel
and
parchingly
dry
id
recommend
having
this
one
well
chilled
as
its
more
of
a
refresher
than
anything
and
i
dont
think
its
flavor
benefits
much
from
a
warmer
serving
temperature
drinkability
a
brilliantly
drinkable
beer
wish
i
had
another
one
very
enjoyable
i
will
now
endeavour
to
find
somewhere
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
seems
like
a
light
lager
with
a
bit
more
happening
flavour
wise
a
very
good
example
of
the
english
golden
ale
style
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
this
is
bottleconditioned
yet
the
end
result
doesnt
really
blow
my
skirt
up
when
all
is
said
and
done
no
real
need
or
desire
to
revisit
this
again
seems
like
everything
else
gets
swamped
by
the
yeast
itself
d
too
gassy
a
little
thin
with
medium
carbonation
works
well
enough
for
this
beer
as
it
seems
to
be
aimed
most
towards
drinkability
a
malt
experience
though
not
too
sweet

overall
probably
one
of

so
tasty
and

i
rarely

this
but
this
beer
is
just
plain
bad
really
bad
totally
cloying
and
a

horrible
on
its

and
especially
horrible

from
the
darker

much
a
sessionable
beer
this
beer
is
what
it
is
a
pub
ale
a
pretty
basic
english
type
of
ale
that
you
get
on
tap
at
a
pub
where
they
can
sell
a
lot
of
it
being
the
abv
is
low
and
the
overall
body
of
this
beer
is
thin
in
the
craft
beer
family
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
years

i
would
have
loved

woodychandler
a
couple
of
reviews
below
this
one
has
it
wrong
i
recieved
this
beer
from
him
in
one
of
his
beautiful
packages
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
malty
biscuity
taste
is
nutty
a
good
bit
of
malts
a
touch
of
toffee
just
a
bit
unusual
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
different
and
enjoyable
beer
picked
up
a
can
from
the
ale
jail
in
st
paul
its
always
a
pleasant
surprise
to
find
another
session
beer
on
the
shelf
and
im
always
a
fan
of
milds
as
it
should
be
its
malty
beer
its
a
touch
heavier
than
id
expect
but
doesnt
feel
too
filling
its
a
sweet
mild
with
a
sugar
cookie
english
biscuit
and
a
bit
of
toffee
theres
a
smooth
fruity
undertone
and
really
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
crack
and
inverted
glug
went
smoothly
right
up
until
it
started
creating
a
massive
head
above
a
pseudocascading
action
and
i
was
forced
to
back
off
color
was
a
deepcopper
with
nequality
clarity
srm
34
settling
i
had
two
fingers
of
dense
foamy
lighttan
head
like
the
top
of
a
mocha
shake
nose
was
syrupy
sweet
and
slightly
buttery
i
felt
as
though
i
were
sitting
down
to
pancakes
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
well
mild
not
too
sweet
not
at
all
bitter
and
with
just
enough
diacetyl
that
even
i
could
discern
it
and
usually
i
cannot
given
the
styles
descriptors
on
this
site
i
would
say
that
they
nailed
it
finish
was
semisweet
not
over
the
top
in
terms
of
its
sweetness
in
any
way
this
combined
with
its
relatively
low
abv
made
for
a
nice
nightcap
i
am
going
to
retire
for
the
day
after
i
finish
i
guess
that
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sessionable
beer
you
could
do
way
worse
than
some
of
these
pub
ale
poured
a
darkish
amber
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
very
mellow
aroma
with
subtle
roasted
malt
notes
and
toffee
notes
the
taste
is
also
very
mellow
and
light
with
some
roasted
malt
notes
and
toffee
flavors
light
flavors
but
nice
either
wise
overall
its
a
nice
flavored
lighter
beer
i
like
this
beer
poured
a
bit
cold
out
of
the
can
but
with
a
large
fluffy
frothy
foamy
light
tan
head
that
soon
settles
to
a
light
cover
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
mahogany
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
a
fresh
malt
molasses
grain
hop
flavors
like
nose
and
light
with
a
touch
of
bitter
at
the
end
body
is
odd
as
its
good
on
one
hand
yet
a
bit
thin
too
carbonation
is
good
finish
is
like
flavor
has
bitter
going
to
sweet
and
has
some
length
pretty
good
drinking
stuff
all
in
all
o
very
sessionable
recommended
the
malts
remind
me
of
a
wellseasoned
british
pub
this
does
seem
more
like
a
mild
than
a
brown
to
me
but
could
buy
it
as
either
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
too
exciting
here
doesnt
really
stack
up
against
best
examples
of
the
style
which
always
shine
in
cask
form
not
sure
i
would
ever
buy
this
again
o
i
liked
this
beer
but
didnt
go
for
another
it
seems
like
some
more
experimentation
with
additional
malts
would
be
a
good
idea
to
given
this
beer
a
little
more
lively
flavor
and
aroma
profile
that
being
said

an
americanized
version
of
the
style
that
carries
a
bit
of
a
bite
but
who
cares
at
least
i
dont
have
to
worry
about
destroying
my
brain
tonight
edit
well
figured
out
a
way
to
do
that
anyways
need
more
milds
presented
in
a
pint
glass
a
mostly
clear
gold
with
a
tall
white
head
that
disappeared
but
left
generous
lacing
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
rich
with
a
dry
grainy
biscuit
and
husk
taste
that
balanced
but
a
touch
of
spicy
herbal
hops
and
slight
cookie
sweetness
a
tasty
session
beer
and
worth
a
try
i
tried
this
one
at
the
gingerman
in
nyc
last
night
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
english
style
cask
ale
very
subtle
hopping
and
quite
drinkable
even
at
cellar
temperature
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
it
has
many
of
the
same
flavors
found
in
a
cask
bitter
but
less
of
the
high
notes
i
expect
some
might
try
this
and
find
its
not
big
enough
and
will
wish
there
were
more
hops
more
body
etc
but
there
are
so
many
beers
that
fill
the
big
slot
in
this
excellent
english
pale
mild
ale
the
subtle
flavors
and
almost
watery
follow
through
are
what
make
this
a
winner
overall
this
beer
would
indeed
go
well
with
most
foods
as
its
almost
like
a
chameleon
blending
in
with
its
surroundings
nothing
big
stands
out
so
nothing
to
clash
with
whatever
youre
eating
notes
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
and
i
cant
really
decide
when
i
would
want
to
drink
it
not
really
a
session
beer
or
one
that
i
would
want
to
casually
sip
seems
like
it
is
marketed
to
go
with
food
and
it
probably
wouldnt
be
bad
that
way
but
there
are
beers
that
i
would
prefer
over
this
to
have
with
food
not
really
a
typical
british
beer
but
a
decent
beer
flavors
just
a
little
too
bland
and
faint
d
would
drink
againnot
a
bad
beer
drinkability
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavours
are
far
too
muted
and
it
gives
the
beer
a
bland
taste
which
is
a
shame
i
can
see
why
they
pitched
it
as
a
dinning
beer
peachy
honeygold
thick
with
bubbles
but
not
up
top
where
it
counts
brown
sugar
caramel
apples
lemon
and
a
very
nice
mellow
but
robust
bay
leafy
herbal
hop
character
round
out
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
balanced
and
light
yet
spicy
i
suspected
that
in
making
a
beer
to
dine
for
greene
king
was
basically
attempting
an
ale
that
tastes
like
a
bland
inoffensive
continental
lager
i
was
half
right
the
taste
is
comparable
to
stella
or
heineken
but
only
in
the
sense
that
it
has
a
similar
balance
of
clear
bready
malts
and
quick
zesty
hops
bland
it
isnt
its
flavorful
grainy
husky
and
sweet
well
spiced
with
a
sort
of
citricherbal
hop
profile
nicely
accentuated
by
a
fizzy
airy
mouthfeel
nice
fruity
undertones
of
grapes
and
orange
as
well
very
good
i
think
and
indeed
it
was
good
with
the
chicken
soup
and
rye
crisps
i
paired
it
with
refreshing
yet
robust
other
comments
very
boring
and
very
skunky
friggin
clear
bottles
cheers
good
drinkability
goes
with
foods
well
d
i
bought
this
beer
on
sale
and
wasnt
expecting
much
wow
was
i
wrong
the
tettnang
hops
really
add
a
nice
character
to
the
beer
this
beer
looks
light
but
it
has
good
flavors
making
this
very
drinkable
there
is
a
nice
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
a
very
good
kolsch
beer
yet
there
are
some
nice
ale
qualities
aswell
they
say
this
is
a
beer
to
dine
for
but
with
food
i
think
the
subtle
flavors
might
not
hold
up
to
spices
and
flavor
of
the
food
the
mouth
is
light
bodied
a
little
creamy
with
a
gentle
citrus
buzz
and
a
mild
hoppy
dryness
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
and
i
can
see
it
pairing
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
foodsthus
its
achieved
its
goal
yet
by
itself
its
merely
an
easy
drinking
unremarkable
brew
decent
overall
the
beer
to
dine
for
is
much
too
cutsie
a
name
for
a
beer
that
expects
to
be
taken
seriously
i
must
admit
though
the
name
and
the
bottle
ensure
that
this
greene
kingmorland
offering
will
get
more
than
a
few
impulse
purchases
in
fact
i
was
one
in
the
end
its
a
decent
english
pale
mild
that
isnt
quite
worth
the
3
99
that
i
paid
for
it
md
this
beer
is
great
on
its
own
too
light
and
carbonated
and
malty
for
me
but
suits
a
nice
dinner
perfectly
goes
well
with
food
and
that
was
its
intention
so
i
must
review
it
within
its
intentions
and
the
style
for
which
it
is
very
good
a
little
more
substantial
than
i
expected
its
my
first
for
the
style
and
actually
fairly
flavorful
md
too
spritzy
to
be
nice
on
the
mouthfeel
and
the
body
is
very
thin
as
well
the
carbonation
is
simply
not
right
making
this
beer
less
than
drinkable
if
consumed
alone
well
probably
thats
why
its
meant
to
be
a
beer
to
dine
for
2006

the

a

from

its
down
to

draw
a

these

has
a

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
quite
mild
but
tasty
fair
beer
on
its
own
as
a
starter
english
ale
for
those
looking
to
jump
into
that
world
i
think
theres
too
much
american
influence
to
make
it
an
authentic
starting
point
money
just
money
i
am
not
sure
how
many
other
amber
milds
i
have
had
but
this
satisfies
with
attributes
from
both
spectrums
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
think
it
would
be
perfect
for
tailgating
now
if
they
would
only
distribute
to
seattle

finishing
with
a
dry

bitterness
with
little
hop
flavor
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
malt
and
light
hops
seemed
very
english
in
flavor
and
although
the
flavor
felt
a
bit
attenuated
that
seems
fair
for
an
ale
named
mild
good
malt
flavor
and
light
but
english
style
hops
this
is
not
a
style
i
have
much
experience
with
so
im
not
sure
how
much
flavor
i
should
be
expecting
the
taste
that
is
present
is
pleasant
but
light
and
appropriately
british

all
the

down
the
aroma
has
an
interesting
fruitiness
to
it
like
dates
a
kiss
of
plain
chocolate
and
a
slight
amount
of
hops
brings
some
hope
to
the
taste
there
is
some
flavor
although
its
simple
and
not
intense
a
kiss
of
chocolate
and
vague
esters
make
much
of
the
flavor
which
overall
is
okay
its
light
bodied
and
a
little
watery
but
would
be
an
okay
choice
as
a
lower
alcohol
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
utah
supermarket
brews
very
drinkable
mild
pleasant
quaff
from
the
16
oz
can
bought
at

market
in

this
can
is
several
months
old
and
still
has
a
spritzy
freshness
overall
a
distinctly
middle
of
the
road
ale
good
solid
mild
getting
impressed
with
the
few
offerings
ive
had
from
this
brewery
overall
drink
this
from
a
glass
it
tastes
terrible
from
the
can
from
the
glass
its
not
great
not
bad
just
a
little
above
average
not
sure
why
this
ale
is
classified
as
an
english
pale
mild
ale
it
tasted
like
a
regular
maltforward
american
amber
ale
to
me
some
of
their
utah
competitors
brew
much
better
brews
to
be
fair
id
say
this
brew
fits
the
month
because
this
is
the
time
of
year
when
peaches
and
apricots
have
ripened
in
the
hot
summer
sun
fairly
refreshing
the
crack
unleashed
a
brimful
can
and
an
inverted
glug
produced
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deepamber
with
nequality
clarity
and
loads
of
co2
bubbles
in
evidence
nose
had
a
nutty
caramel
malty
scent
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
nuttiness
of
the
malt
was
immediate
on
the
tongue
along
with
a
light
grassy
hoppiness
i
cannot
say
that
i
cansider
myself
an
expert
on
the
style
but
in
looking
at
the
sites
description
i
would
say
that
this
is
an
excellent
example
the
finish
had
a
light
butteriness
which
is
apparently
okay
in
the
style
at
only
4
0
abv
it
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
but
i
always
feel
like
i
need
more
hops

mohare
you
hopheads
poured
from
a
16

can
has
a

with
a
12

kind
of

very

drinking
some
hops
up
front
followed
by
the
malts
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
m
light
to
medium
bodied
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
brew
it
has
lots
of
flavor
and
isnt
watery
a
dead
horse
is
an
appropriate
symbol
for
this
beer
it
needs
cpr
desperately
it
is
light
on
all
respects
light
in
color
lacing
mouthfeel
taste
and
general
satisfaction
the
brewmasters
need
to
serve
an
apprenticeship
at
a
northwest
brewery
its
ok
on
a
hot
day
when
there
is
nothing
but
bud
miller
and
hamms
as
alternatives
but
thats
not
saying
much
joseph
smith
you
need
googles
other
than
those
made
of
stone
apparently
you
can
beat
a
dead
horse
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thin
watery
he
finish
is
mild
i
feel
that
the
beer
lacks
a
lot
of
character
and
life
i
will
revisit
this
beer
d
mild
flavors
smooth
texture
balanced
body
and
clean
finsih
make
this
a
nice
and
easy
session
brew
d
not
up
to
par
with
the
rest
of
the
beers
in
this
style
i
couldnt
finish
it
bottom
line
a
very
average
brew
at
best
and
1
id
not
consider
to
drink
again
pours
straw
colored
almost
orange
in
the
darker

of
caramel
malts
and
very
slight
grassy
hops
some
sweet
caramel
malt
up
front
followed
by
a
nice
earthy
hopping
that
finished
clean
at
first
theres
a
slight
tinge
to
the
aftertaste
that
i
cant
quite
pick
out
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
feels
watery
on
the
tongue
actually
a
bit
watery
across
the
board
nothing
really
stands
out
all
that
much
completely
drinkable
on
a
nice
summer
day
but
ive
got
gotos
in
the
fridge
thatll
be
pulled
first
very
light
and
easy
drinking
in
the
english
mild
tradition
style
as
stated
on
the
label
several
wouldnt
be
out
of
the
question
in
warmer
weather
mk
overall
a
clean
and
crisp
ale
that
gains
points
for
its
good
drinkability
thanks
to
wasatch
overall
just
to
thin
and
watery
very
weak
flavor
more
like
carbonated
water
with
some
off
flavors
than
a
beer
to
me
malt
flavors
are
thin
and
more
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
than
with
each
sip
just
some
ever
so
slight
hop
presence
but
again
i
find
it
more
in
the
aftertaste
i
would
forget
i
was
drinking
a
beer
if
it
were
not
for
the
aftertaste
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
that
leans
toward
watery
probably
a
nice
quaffable
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
yard
work
but
not
something
to
savor
in
the
evening
thanks
to
jcwattsrugger
for
bringing
this
back
from
utah
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
very
filling
there
are
certainly
several
other
beers
with
a
kick
as
mild
as
this
beers
that
i
would
prefer
to
drink
if
im
going
to
go
for
a
lighter
style
of
beer
d
nice
to
try
not
outstanding
but
wouldnt
turn
down
another
either
abv
is
unknown
but
something
tells
me
this
is
a
lower
one
sessionable
and
certainly
drinkable
for
2
pints
at
least
thanks
again
john
hats
off
to
wasatch
for
a
fine
frosty
sent
from
utah
this
is
my
first
moab
beer
thanks
wasatch
so
i
dont
yet
have
enough
information
to
pass
judgment
on
the
brewery
as
a
whole
the
basic
framework
for
the
construction
of
a
quality
amber
ale
is
present
it
just
needs
to
be
fleshed
out
a
little
this
dead
horse
could
use
a
little
more
life
overall
a
vaguely
drinkable
lawnmower
beer
with
no
huge
flaws
other
than
the
lack
of
interesting
flavor
or
body
i
certainly
wont
spend
much
more
money
on
it
if
any
you
cant
beat
a
dead
horse
eh
well

about
that

quite
balance
the

moderate

ale
leans

for
sure
a

the
taste
is
great
as
with
most
ut
beers
light

with
a

taste
many
of
these
can
be
had
its
a
very
nice
micro
for
a
ut

would
recommend
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
brew
utterly
smooth
with
the
carbonation
coming
through
as
a
followup
medium
body
comes
across
as
heavy
just
a
little
above
average
this
beer
is
best
as
a
summer
ale
light
in
body
and
color
somewhat
sweet
at
first
then
finishes
very
dry
and
bitter
overall
the
flavor
is
average
for
a
beer
of
this
style
this
beer
goes
well
with
pizza
for
instance
but
not
much
else
they
say
you
cant
beat
a
dead
horse
it
looked
a
bit
copper
in
color
being
an
amber
ale
the
mid
mountain
mile
ale
is
just
that
a
mild
tasty
beer
that
would
be
perfect
with
everything
the
chicken
man
who
is
eventually
moving
to
the
land
of
utah
provided
this
morsel
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
foamy
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
is
very
faint
almost
nondescript
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
between
malt
and
bittering
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
very
sessionable
othis
brew
wont
win
any
awards
but
i
would
not
turn
one
down
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
simple
and
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
highpoint
since
the
smell
and
taste
are
somewhat
uninspiring
criticisms
aside
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
sharing
a
few
pints
of
this
with
friends
at
a
bar
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
nose
starts
with
some
dry
malts
followed
by
some
biscuity
character
some
mild
hops
round
it
out
at
the
end
taste
is
malt
forward
with
very
mild
flavors
the
base
grain
come
through
strong
with
light
notes
of
sweetness
which
is
cut
by
dry
biscuit
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
not
sure
how
this
is
a
mild
though
overall
a
tasty
ale
on
the
mild
side
for
sure
but
it
is
enjoyable
a
respectable
mild
malt
beverage
this
probably
wont
appeal
to
any
ipa
hop
heads
but
then
this
isnt
the
style
relatively
light
in
character
overall
but
with
a
pleasing
toasted
grain
and
nut
character
that
proves
quite
satisfying
to
the
taste
buds
aside
from
the
obvious
question
of
how
a
mild
makes
the
exponential
series
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
its
not
what
i
expected
though
and
english
mild
this
is
decidedly
american
darker
in
color
too
caramel
medium
spectrum
heady
and
well
carbonated
it
has
more
than
just
light
grain
and
i
appreciate
immediately
its
diversity
there
is
a
touch
of
smoke
some
darker
toast
and
the
delicacy
of
white
wheat
all
in
great
balance
our
bottle
says
4
5
abv
and
it
certainly
doesnt
seem
any
more
than
that
very
drinkable
and
soft
not
as
interesting
as
some
but
the
plethora
of
grains
makes
it
not
boring
not
sure
i
could
session
this
long
enough
to
catch
a
buzz
but
i
like
its
richness
for
the
abv
and
i
like
how
smooth
it
finishes
flavorful
and
everything
in
good
harmony
not
a
beer
thats
meant
to
wow
you
epic
has
plenty
of
choices
for
that
but
a
good
hearty
mild
as
they
go
and
one
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
drinking
again
especially
at
about
4
bucks
a
bomber
very
appealing
no
off
flavors
so
it
is
easy
to
drink
probably
pair
with
a
simple
salad
no
dressing
not
really
sessionable
so
not
an
all
day
beer
would
be
a
bit
boring
if
it
were
t
smooth
and
malty
with
light
breadiness
some
lemon
a
bit
of
grain
watered
down
honey
and
some
faint
grassy
hops
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
this
style
but
this
is
pretty
good
light
and
pretty
refreshing
without
being
too
boring
id
say
its
great
to
have
a
mild
ale
but
so
much
of
the
beer
in
utah
is
4
abv
that
this
is
actually
a
heavy
beer
ha
pours
amber
with
a
solid
sheet
of
off
white
fine
foam
great
clarity
nose
carries
a
sweet
bread
character
some
metal
leaves
wood
white
grape
jelly
and
the
slightest
hint
of
connecticut
leaf
tobacco
flavor
is
a
bit
astringent
some
cardboard
some
loose
grain
a
bit
of
oatmeal
plain
some
raisin
and
a
hint
of
pekoe
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
nice
beer
i
can
appreciate
final
thoughts
im
not
sure
where
i
stand
on
this
one
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
i
would
recommend
it
to
someone
who
is
new
to
craft
beer
its
basically
an
average
beer
but
far
from
being
memorable
as
a
fan
of
epic
a
local
in
utah
ready
for
more
of
their
good
stuff
this
one
falls
off
the
list
quickly
d
very
drinkable
nice
example
of
an
english
mild
good
overall
balance
and
malt

made
up
of
rather
large

low
hopping

with
a
slight
earthy
aroma
and
flavor
quite
drinkable
with
a
smooth

feel
this
is
one
i
will
buy
again
and
is
the
first
mild
ale
i
have
tasted
o
very
drinkable
and
good
for
what
it
is
i
wouldnt
have
another
but
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
sessionable
englishstyle
ale
quite
a
flavorful
session
ale
a
great
example
of
what
a
lowabv
beer
can
be
solid
across
the
board
very
nice
mellow
balanced
and
flavorful
without
needing
to
bludgeon
you
with
any
of
its
elements
i
dont
know
much
about
milds
but
it
seems
like
5
abv
is
a
bit
high
this
beer
also
seems
a
little
heavier
than
i
would
imagine
a
mild
to
be
nevertheless
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
one
i
would
not
mind
drinking
anytime
recommended
o
id
have
this
one
again
its
simple
well
crafted
and
quite
tasty
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
pretty
subtle
with
some
grain
and
slight
fruity
aromas
taste
is
also
very
subtle
with
grain
and
some
fruity
and
almost
tealike
flavors
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
in
my
opinion
but
its
the
first
of
the
style
i
have
had
finally
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
there
is
not
much
which
stands
out
and
this
seems
too
generic
to
get
excited
about
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
am
not
impressed

pleasant

hops
caramel
nuts

not
bad
for
the
style
feel
is
light
with
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
malty

overall
a
decent
beer
in
the
style
cheers
overall
pretty
easy
drinking
sort
of
has
an
english
pale
ale
style
to
it
but
quite
tasty
i
must
admit
im
not
sure
why
they
decided
to
make
a
mild
thats
25
higher
in
alcohol
than
the
utah
draft
limit
of
4
abv
release
no

with

1

a
caramel
delight
very
smooth
and
mild
which
for
my
palate
reviewing
it
simply
as
what
is
in
my
glass
this
wasnt
too
bad
kbutler1aug

i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
keefdaug

and
hints
of
caramel
and
honey
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
the
style
is
what
the
style
is
this
has
more
character
than
your
big
box
lagers
the
you
know
whos
and
is
a
nice
drinkable
ale
is
it
a
world
beater
no
of
course
not
but
it
does
what
it
sets
out
to
do
a
good
brew
for
those
who
cant
grab
an
english
export
to
experience
the
genesis
of
the
style
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
grains
a
bit
bready
taste
is
light
and
mild
some
breadyness
and
malts
not
a
very
strong
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
o
honestly
this
tastes
exactly
like
beers
ive
screwed
up
and
infected
i
want
to
like
this
local
brewery
but
after
reading
other
reviews
and
trying
this
first
hand
i
think
they
have
a
few
things
to
work
out
before
i
buy
another
from
them
o
a
decent
pale
mild
nothing
outstanding
but
then
again
theres
nothing
horribly
wrong
with
it
either
bottomline
unless
youre
a
diehard
fan
of
the
style
or
someone
who
has
to
try
every
beer
in
existence
you
can
getaway
with
skipping
this
one
cheers
body
is
medium
to
slightly
light
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
and
feels
a
little
fizzy
overall
theres
nothing
particularly
remarkable
about
this
beer
its
pretty
drinkable
but
a
bit
bland
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
odd
theres
a
faint
suggestion
of
soured
milk
and
overripe
fruit
throwing
things
off
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
as
well
this
was
my
first
try
for
something
from
boxcar
in
west
chester
overall
it
tasted
closer
to
a
wheat
or
blonde
or
mile
pale
ale
than
an
apa
a
reclassification
for
this
might
be
due
as
the
apa
made
me
believe
there
would
be
at
least
some
hop
kick
which
wasnt
there
decent
taste
easy
to
drink
good
session
beer
for
summer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
ipa
o
really
more
like
a
british
pale
mild
or
american
blonde
either
way
it
just
seems
to
lack
depth
thats
seen
in
some
of
the
better
apas
out
there
i
want
to
like
this
brewery
so
bad
since
theyre
so
local
to
me
but
so
far
its
just
not
working
out
the
taste
is
ok
but
is
grassy
as
the
aroma
indicates
the
malt
is
light
in
the
flavor
maybe
a
bit
of
toast
but
gently
bitter
grass
and
herbal
notes
override
the
grainy
taste
the
finish
is
dry
and
overall
i
thought
it
was
unique
but
not
the
tastiest
pale
or
mild
ale
i
have
had
cheers
ordered
simply
because
it
was
a
new
tap
handle
i
have
never
seen
poured
a
hazed
pale
yellow
color
with
minimal
head
assumed
it
was
a
belgian
wit
scent
was
very
light
with
touches
of
yeast
and
lemon
lightly
sweet
bubblegum
presence
again
assumed
it
was
just
a
light
wit
beer
taste
was
extremely
light
with
only
a
faint
taste
of
yeast
and
lemon
convinced
it
was
a
light
wit
beer
medium
bodied
lightly
oily
undercarbonated
when
all
was
said
and
done
and
i
was
left
extremely
disapointed
in
my
wit
beer
i
popped
on
ba
on
my
mobile
and
saw
this
was
a
pale
ale
then
i
was
pretty
much
over
the
disapointment
and
borderline
angry
jk
original
is
a
proper
term
for
this
beer
as
it
is
a
pale
ale
that
looks
like
a
mix
between
a
hazy
hefe
and
a
light
fruit
beer
the
color
is
hazy
yellow
with
some
oranges
and
reds
mixed
in
underneath
a
georgeous
whitepinkish
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
like
flies
on
shit
this
smells
awfully
sweet
for
a
pale
ale
i
thought
this
was
a
fruit
beer
or
something
a
belgian
type
nose
with
some
bubblegum
cherry
and
some
pale
malting
i
dig
it
and
this
does
not
taste
like
a
pale
ale
either
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
taste
is
of
some
wheat
with
fruits
such
as
cherry
and
slight
citrus
qualities
underneath
some
pale
malts
slight
caramel
vibe
that
just
works
for
some
odd
reason
feels
bigger
than
it
is5
but
remains
a
bit
bigger
than
light
bodied
with
expert
carb
rolling
off
the
tounge
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
and
would
purchase
again
and
again
appearance
is
interesting
had
to
double
check
that
this
was
an
apa
and
not
a
hefe
or
pale
wheat
pours
an
unfiltered
hazed
banana
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
with
surprising
retention
and
lack
of
lacing
aroma
is
mild
and
sweet
notes
of
butterscotch
grapefruit
caramel
and
a
slight
alcohol
bite
medium
bodied
with
strong
fine
carbonation
and
a
sloppy
and
stale
finish
unsurprisingly
like
the
rest
of
the
presentation
the
flavor
continues
to
have
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
veering
at
times
from
apa
to
wheat
beer
to
kolsch
to
who
knows
what
oddly
i
do
enjoy
drinking
this
even
if
it
drinks
much
bigger
and
stronger
than
its
5
abv
the
flavor
is
sweet
without
being
cloying
dominated
by
sweet
ripe
fruits
butterscotch
pale
malt
mild
tanginess
etc
hard
to
pinpoint
any
particular
off
flavor
but
the
overall
impression
of
this
is
that
this
beer
is
a
work
in
progress
quite
drinkable
but
theres
something
unfinished
about
it
d
this
is
a
really
nice
easy
drinking
apa
that
ill
be
drinking
again
also
youve
gotta
love
an
up
and
coming
brewery
from
my
hometown
of
west
chester
i
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
the
ownerbrewer
who
was
a
great
very
knowledgable
guy
its
always
nice
to
have
great
beer
options
so
close
to
home
welcome
boxcar
brewing
dr
dang
easy
this
is
a
weird
beer
and
not
at
all
what
i
expect
to
be
getting
from
helltown
this
germanenglish
hybrid
seems
fairly
evident
but
its
just
weird
odd
mix
of
flavors
tangy
nutty
very
mild
spicy
no
cohesion
as
it
just
seems
all
over
the
place
this
is
weird
and
it
just
doesnt
work
at
all
can
i
find
an
ipa
from
helltown
already
for
the
love
of
pete
overall
english
pale
mild
is
a
good
descriptor
of
this
beer
the
hops
used
were
a
bit
more
american
but
it
works
great
here
helltown
is
a
fine
little
brewery
and
so
far
everything
theyve
done
has
been
excellent
im
gonna
call
this
one
a
pale
mild
bordering
on
a
bitter
because
the
hops
are
soft
enough
not
bad
id
dig
into
another
one
o
pretty
representative
of
the
style
and
decently
tasty
i
just
hope
that
they
have
their
bottle
conditioning
under
control
for
the
beers
that
are
being
sold
on
the
shelf
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
carbonation
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
and
i
think
more
english
malts
need
to
be
used
the
balance
can
be
tweaked
a
bit
giving
it
a
smoother
sweeter
finish
that
traditional
english
milds
have
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
ambercopper
coloring
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
throughout
the
body
and
a
low
profile
fluffy
bubbly
offwhite
head
aromas
of
tangy
caramel
and
roasted
toffee
forward
with
some
sugary
sweet
highlights
and
woody
notes
aromas
are
a
bit
muted
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
forward
with
a
blast
of
rich
tangy
sweet
toffee
bordering
on
sugary
with
some
darker
caramel
undertones
subtle
roast
and
bitterness
in
the
tail
end
but
overall
cloyingly
sweet
the
body
is
light
and
somewhat
effervesced
by
the
steady
flow
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
roasted
and
rich
characteristics
that
have
been
present
throughout
the
finish
is
light
a
bit
crisp
and
the
sweet
characteristics
do
hang
out
quite
a
bit
i
haventt
had
a
mystery
brew
in
awhile
so
i
figured
this
mild
would
go
well
on
a
cold
rainy
afternoon
at
home
today
poured
into
an
impy
nonic
a
burnt
orange
tinged
copper
color
with
a
large
blooming
head
wich
wasnt
expectedmaybe
a
bit
over
carbonated
wich
shows
up
more
in
the
feelnice
color
though
aromas
are
alittle
yeasty
with
some
brown
sugar
and
caramel
standing
outthe
yeast
seems
to
be
a
little
heavy
handed
here
the
carbonation
makes
for
some
prickly
feeling
in
the
mouth
and
for
some
burps
right
away
after
swallowing
flavors
are
pretty
good
for
the
style
with
some
caramel
toffee
flavors
and
earthy
hops
that
do
stand
out
wich
is
niceagain
the
yeastiness
is
a
little
heavy
handed
not
bad
but
it
seems
a
little
outta
whack
for
the
stylefor
the
record
i
think
mystery
makes
some
really
good
stuff
but
this
needs
some
tweaking
in
my
opinion
oi
finally
managed
to
get
to
hogshead
and
i
was
happy
to
do
so
this
is
a
pretty
good
easydrinking
pale
ale
the
dryhopped
version
i
had
opened
with
an
easy
somewhat
boring
fruity
and
bread
pale
malt
flavor
but
finished
with
a
nice
bit
of
bittering
citrus
bite
and
intrigue
quaffable
and
interesting
a
decent
session
brew
from
this
new
brewery
northwest
of
denver
metro
pours
clear
new
penny
color
with
a
couple
fingers
of
white
lace
the
smell
is
caramel
malts
and
pale
malts
english
in
origin
and
a
surprising
bit
of
bittering
hops
as
well
flavor
is
laid
back
drinkable
balanced
brew
with
a
little
character
from
a
curious
yeast
coming
through
this
is
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
but
as
with
their
porter
it
is
sort
of
nondiscript
no
different
from
countless
other
beers
of
the
same
style
its
well
made
but
not
exciting
feel
is
a
little
flat
and
i
probably
should
have
tried
it
from
the
cask
instead
light
enough
body
down
easy
overall
nothing
going
to
blow
your
mind
here
but
a
good
summer
slammer
on
cask
and
dryhopped
with
east
kent
goldings
light
bright
yelloworange
sudsy
head
brief
citrus
like
smell
nice
aroma
flavor
is
just
a
solid
english
ale
malty
yet
a
hint
of
hops
easy
drinking
delicious
i
wish
i
could
be
more
nuanced
and
descriptive
but
this
was
just
flat
out
a
good
session
beer
3

that
always
works
for
me
nice
grainy
tone
not
overdone
or
obnoxiously
one
sided
like
a
lot
of
lighter
beers
tend
to
be
easy
drinking
but
with
a
bit
more
body
on
it
carbonation
is
a
bit
full
and
nipping
a
good
start
to
my

brewery
doesnt
go
under
as
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
that
will
now
be
in
my
rotation
of
regular
beers
overall
well
balanced
and
quite
frankly
very
flavorful
clear
yellow
with
bright
white
head
nose
is
creamy
and
hay
like
palate
is
richer
than
it
should
be
with
fresh
cream
and
golden
ale
like
very
refreshing
and
creamy
texture
really
a
wonderful
way
to
start
the
day
pours
a
light
cloudy
nitro
gold
with
the
cascading
effect
and
a
creamy
white
cap
aroma
is
faint
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
and
english
pale
malts
a
gentle
flavor
of
mild
grains
noble
hopping
and
a
light
lemony
twang
easy
drinking
super
smooth
carbonation
was
so
low
the
beer
pulled
almost
like
air
very
light
a
mellow
brew
but
pleasing
in
its
ways
similar
to
a
boddingtons
pub
ale
but
even
lighter
on
the
palate
i
found
this
be
quite
the
flavorful
and
quaffable
offering
from
victory
that
really
is
the
definition
of
what
a
session
beer
should
be
they
really
packed
a
lot
into
this
3
5
mild
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
day
and
not
get
bored
with
it
d
the
epitome
of
a
session
beer
light
delicate
flavors
with
really
low
alcohol
good
offering
and
leaves
me
with
only
two
more
styles
to
try
which
is
a
bit
sad
as
every
new
style
really
presents
something
different
which
is
always
nice
given
the
extremely
low
abv
and
the
style
this
is
a
beer
you
could
drink
for
days
personally
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
too
bland
for
my
liking
served
up
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
wonderful
creamy
white
head
and
nice
lacing
served
on
nitro
something
i
did
not
realize
until
i
asked
for
a
growler
of
it
and
was
turned
down
the
aroma
was
very
clean
with
great
biscuit
malt
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
fruitiness
it
smelled
almost
like
a
dortmunder
lager
but
with
a
bit
of
ale
yeast
character
the
taste
picked
up
where
the
aroma
left
off
clean
malty
sweet
and
delicious
some
grassy
hops
were
present
but
bitterness
was
quite
low
it
also
had
a
sort
of
buttery
quality
that
i
found
to
be
unique
and
a
welcome
guest
at
the
flavor
party
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
with
a
wonderful
smoothness
from
the
nitro
and
a
subdued
carbonation
i
could
pound
these
all
day
and
the
super
low
abv
would
mean
that
my
biggest
worry
would
be
bathroom
breaks
possibly
the
best
victory
draft
only
offering
i
have
had
to
date
perhaps
its
because
i
wasnt
really
jonesing
for
a
golden
ale
on
a
near
70
boston
winters
day
technically
though
its
really
spring
for
what
its
worth
regardless
it
was
a
nice
pour
from
michael
at
the
otherside
so
theres
no
faulting
his
recommendation
either
brilliant
yellow
straw
colored
with
a
dense
white
creamy
head
a
la
nitro
though
i
was
told
cask
crisp
and
clean
with
subtle
malt
and
a
bit
of
flower
an
mineral
water
but
overall
bland
the
creamy
head
that
stuck
nicely
as
lace
did
add
some
nice
body
to
this
cream
ale
meet
pilsener
a
good
hot
day
low
alcohol
substitute
for
many
weaker
contenders
but
not
that
impressive
overall
nice
as
a
cream
ale
drinkability
this
beer
was
a
pleasure
to
have
after
having
a
big
alcohol
beer
very
easy
to
quaff
and
despite
the
mild
flavor
profile
and
it
is
somewhat
refreshing
glad
i
tried
one
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
up
front
leading
to
a
watery
thin
finish
d
this
beer
is
not
for
everyone
even
our
waitress
said
it
was
like
pilsner
with
a
few
icecubes
tossed
in
but
for
the
style
i
liked
it
found
it
tasty
and
worthy
of
more
samples
if
they
hadnt
had
1416
other
great
brews
on
at
the
brewpub
m
body
was
slightly
thin
id
love
to
see
this
mild
on
the
engine
very
right
pour
clear
reddish
brown
hue
with
a
off
white
head
that
does
not
waver
nutty
toasty
bready
aroma
and
flavor
very
easy
drinking
at
3
7
but
a
whole
lot
more
flavor
compared
to
what
most
brewers
are
pushing
out
during
this
session
beer
craze
hats
off
to
2nd
story
for
brewing
a
true
session
ale
and
keeping
it
pretty
authentic
american
style
pour
was
more
flavorful
with
chocolate
in
the
taste
the
english
pull
style
pour
was
more
of
a
tea
flavor
in
the
beer
frankly
i
see
this
as
more
of
an
esb
than
a
mild
a
nice
hearty
ale
drinks
fairly
easy
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
again
the
powdery
dryness
does
little
for
me
a
touch
too
sweet
could
use
a
little
more
bitterness
for
balance
very
good
beer
overall
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
despite
the
abv

creamyvelvety
warm
round
thick
but
not
too
heavy
massive
head
with
a
great

and

hue
very
toasty
fresh
bread
and
biscuity
nose
and
palate
hint
of
lemony
hop
zest
and
alcohol
in
the
middle
and
dry
throughout
packed
with
soooo
much
flavor
a
lovely
malt
bomb
and
warming
as
well
not
all
mild
ales
need
to
be
small
quaffable
brews
loving
this
ale
the
taste
has
a
very
subtle
malt
and
lightly
roasted
flavor
with
nutty
english
malt
character
with
slight
hops
in
the
taste
just
enough
to
keep
things
in
balance
the
yeast
has
a
mostly
clean
flavor
yet
it
accentuates
the
beautiful
malt
and
slightly
dry
pine
flavored
finish
with
almost
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
overall
a
very
good
imperial
mild
it
carries
a
lot
of
the
session
beers
style
into
a
strong
version
which
is
excellent
drinkability

be

up

congrats
to
summit
brewer
damian
mcconn
overall
the
union
series
has
another
winner
here
with
the
3x
mild
ale
which
i
would
probably
describe
as
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
or
even
strong
ale
instead
of
a
mild
it
is
a
malty
treat
plenty
of
fruit
and
barley
with
earthy
hops
for
balance
bravo
damian
mcconn
bravo
overall
a
pretty
solid
take

i
will
need
to
try
this
again
at
various

suggests
cellaring
this
to
become
more
like
an
old
ale

beer
is

rather
nice
light
but
tasty
and
refreshing
subtle
aromatic
hops

a
dry

this

to
drink
would
be
great
on
a

sampling

on

drinkability
average
golden
ale
nice
aroma
but
not
enough
taste
for
the
carbonation
and
alcohol
overall
another
pretty
standard
and
dull
english
blonde
ale
worth
a
try
maybe
once
a
lovely
drop
that
is
one
of
my
favourite
mid
strength
beers
coopers
make
great
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
o
a
standard
midstrength
beer
not
bad
but
i
have
other
favourites
in
the
midstrength
beers
i
would
buy
over
this
at
first
i
thought
not
really
bad
but
also
not
very
traditional
then
it
started
downhill
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
color
being
quite
light
it
did
have
some
noticeable
hops
but
not
much
malt
very
thin
unbalanced
beer
theres
significant
long
lasting
carbonic
tang
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
either
now
that
im
done
with
this
review
the
brew
gets
dumped
overall
tastes
somewhat
like
a
lighter
lower
abv
version
of
the
coopers
flagship
pale
ale
and
sparkling
ale
the
only
problem
with
that
is
that
it
lacks
any
kind
of
individuality
and
just
leaves
me
thinking
why
not
just
get
a
pale
ale
if
i
was
getting
a
semicraft
lower
abv
beer
id
just
get
a
little
creatures
rogers
beer
o
drinkable
at
least
it
is
a
bit
more
robust
thaan
most
of
the
light
beers
on
the
market
i
can
fully
understand
why
coopers
created
this
drop
nice
one
overall
not
unexpectedly
it
has
the
generic
coopers
characters
toned
down
from
say
the
pale
or
the
sparkling
ale
it
ends
up
being
not
particularly
exciting
or
interesting
as
a
result
but
for
a
sub
4
beer
this
is
one
of
your
best
bets
in
australia
o
mild
is
right
in
every
way
drinkable
food
match
in
fact
im
going
to
recommend
the
exact
same
food
i
recommended
for
the
pale
ale
grilled
chicken
or
fish
with
a
light
salad
drizzled
with
balsamic
vinegar
maybe
calamari
or
other
seafood
crab
lobster
drinkability
decent
but
the
sparkling
and
pale
ales
are
better
and
better
value
light
and
inoffensive
but
not
a
beer
drinking
highlight
body
is
ridiculously
watery
as
far
as
light
or
mid
australian
beers
gothis
would
be
one
of
my
favouritesat
least
it
is
real
ale
not
a
lot
to
this
one
average
at
best
give
me
a
lc
rogers
any
day
poured
a
golden
colour
with
a
bubbly
head
that
disappeared
right
before
my
eyes
is
quite
cloudy
with
some
sediment
smells
yeasty
and
sweet
and
has
a
sweet
flavour
with
a
small
bite
at
the
end
quite
fizzy
and
is
a
bit
fizzier
than
im
used
to
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
quick
succession
surprised
that
im
scoring
it
this
high
as
from
memory
this
is
not
as
good
as
their
pale
ale
which
i
gave
a
lower
score
still
its
impressive
for
a
midstrength
and
easier
drinking
than
most
the
the
coopers
offerings
not
huge
on
flavour
but
quite
refreshing
decent
value
and
good
quality
not
something
id
drink
often
though
d
there
are
many
better
beers
out
there
but
i
challenge
anyone
to
find
me
an
australian
brewed
3
5
beer
thats
anywhere
close
to
this
one
a
decent
drop
if
you
have
to
drive
but
want
a
beer
drinability
easy
to
drink
lacks
flavour
however
probably
one
of
the
best
mild
ales
in
aus
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
no
head
even
after
pouring
into
the
middle
of
the
glass
smells
somewhat
hoppy
some
citrus
a
hint
woody
the
taste
is
pretty
thin
not
much
sweetness
to
speak
of
it
does
have
a
clean
finish
but
not
too
much
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
watery
all
in
all
its
fairly
drinkable
only
because
it
doesnt
have
any
overpowering
flavors
might
be
good
on
a
hot
day
poured
an
odd
cloudy
orange
color
not
particularly
appealing
looking
smell
was
salty
with
a
slight
earthy
tense
taste
was
pretty
grainy
with
some
maltyness
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
unimpressive
i
was
very
close
to
pouring
this
one
out
so
drinkability
im
not
too
crazy
about
with
this
beer
probably
the
worst
beer
that
i
have
sampled
from
coopers
brewery
it
just
seemed
boring
and
frightfully
uninspired
i
would
avoid
this
one
cheers
rogers
shits
all
over
this
for
a
mid
strength
beer
with
flava
the
flavours
dont
do
a
lot
for
me
but
if
you
like
their
sparkling
ale
and
would
like
a
little
less
abv
then
this
would
suit
bitterness
levels
are
low
but
lower
malt
profile
makes
it
acceptable
there
is
malt
in
there
on
the
palate
but
low
which
is
fitting
for
style
on
the
whole
i
think
its
an
acceptable
beer
for
a
thirsty
palate
and
i
would
gladly
drink
it
when
seeking
a
low
alcohol
alternative
fairly
drinkable
inoffensive
not
very
strong
in
flavour
but
it
tastes
fresh
well
a
bit
underwhelming
and
i
dont
think
i
was
expecting
too
much
from
it
they
have
better
brews
than
this
at
coopers
as
soon
as
i
poured
this
i
was
disappointed
after
a
hard
days
work
the
enjoyment
of
any
beer
is
enhanced
yet
this
one
is
upsettingly
average
for
a
coopers
ale
the
head
seemed
not
to
form
correctly
while
pouring
so
there
was
an
excess
of
effervescence
and
a
consequent
lack
of
head
retention
there
is
noticeably
less
yeast
suspended
in
the
beer
than
most
coopers
ales
which
is
one
thing
i
love
about
the
brewery
it
is
fairly
mild
but
i
just
noticed
some
faint
but
pleasing
roast
coffee
characteristics
overall
i
hoped
this
would
be
better
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
ill
give
it
another
go
one
day
in
case
it
was
a
slightly
infected
brew
explaining
the
flatness
but
maybe
i
just
prefer
a
meatier
coopers
well
it
seems
overall
this
is
a
pretty
lackluster
effort
by
coopers
however
this
is
still
better
than
any
commercial
lightmid
strength
out
there
still
tastes
cooperish
but
i
would
head
for
the
rogers
or
moonlight
before
this
one
that
would
be
an
amazing
beer
if
it
had
more
body
and
keeping
the
same
proportion
but
increasing
the
quantity
of
its
hops
added
to
the
recipe
d
a
fairly
pleasant
appealing
pale
that
is
leaning
toward
a
summer
mild
i
would
prefer
it
to
have
some
more
darker
cmalt
notes
but
then
it
might
be
just
a
mild
oh
well
its
good
as
it
is
milds
are
a
good
thing
i
dont
understand
why
more
people
do
not
appreciate
small
flavorful
beers
whilst
in
bogota
and
i
visited
palos
de
moguer
and
the
second
beer
i
tried
was
the
colon
rubia
the
appearance
was
golden
in
color
with
good
carbonation
and
white
head
the
aroma
carried
hints
of
lemon
and
grain
somewhat
similar
to
their
light
beer
the
taste
had
more
malt
than
hop
with
hint
of
lemon
the
mouthfeel
was
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
certainly
worth
a
try
bitterness
has
seemed
to
be
increased
a
bit
very
balanced
and
tasty
in
my
book
is
very
much
a
west
coast
style
of
english
ale
more
citrusy
bitter
than
typical
english
im
upgrading
the
taste
rereviewing
is
fun
my
palates
evolved
and
now
im
making
it
less
and
less
biased

amber

with
a

sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
it
has
a
sweet
lemon
and
dried

nose
initially
fairly
nondescript
then
a
wee

a

and
then
a
more
herbal

finish
nowhere
near
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggests
this
feels
insubstantial
but
doesnt
taste
watery
overall
better
than
anticipated
i
agree
this
seems
wrongly
categorised
different
and
pleasant
not
sure
its
a
pale
mild
though
it
was
just
so
damn
fresh
but
then
i
live
about
2
hours
from
the
brewery
it
pours
well
and
drinks
well
the
flavour
is
somewhat
floral
but
not
overpowering
decent
amount
of
hops
but
not
bitter
it
has
more
body
than
their
blonde
and
went
very
well
with
the
bbq
dinner
out
in
the
backgarden
with
some
good
ayrshire
sausages
this
theme
of
hops
and
orange
continue
their
domination
through
to
the
taste
with
a
slightly
aftertaste
of
spices
however
the
body
of
the
beer
let
it
down
very
watery
no
head
retention
this
very
quickly
started
to
remind
me
of
lager
too
much
so
to
be
anything
more
than
a
thirst
quencher
however
i
would
go
for
something
else
personally
d
i
cant
say
i
like
this
beer
but
it
surely
tastes
different
for
a
bitterpale
ale
with
its
semisour
juice
suggestion
at
each
step
that
said
im
still
unclear
about
what
it
means
by
english
pale
mild
ale
which
this
beer
is
categorised
here
as
i
said
earlier
the
taste
is
unbalanced
with
some
more
powerful
malt
this
would
have
been
a
fantastic
ale
my
first
and
only
stab
at
the
pale
mild
style
i
wasnt
super
impressed
with
this
one
o
i
think
this
is
probably
a
style
that
id
like
especially
in
summer
its
not
a
popular
style
in
the
us
so
maybe
ill
try
brewing
one
of
my
own
sometime
its
brewed
locally
so
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
on
draft
the
chalkboard
at
the
brewpub
said
english
strong
alebut
i
dont
think
it
was
thati
would
say
its
in
the
right
category
came
to
the
table
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
dull
medium
golden
with
a
thinner
white
head
atoparomas
mainly
consisted
of
biscuit
malt
and
light
fruitiness
caramel
toffee
flavors
stood
out
most
on
the
palatea
firm
biscuit
malt
base
was
the
main
component
of
the
beervery
light
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
not
bad
for
the
stylewould
like
to
have
on
cask
to
magnify
the
subtle
flavors
of
the
beer
notes
this
beer
just
works
well
with
its
simplicity
and
balance
making
for
a
very
enjoyable
beer
next
door
ale
is
the
house
beer
for
the
soontoopen
next
door
bar
grill
in
pittsford
its
a
very
clear
golden
ale
with
a
small
white
ring
of
a
head
it
has
a
faint
malty
pretzely
aroma
thats
slightly
sweet
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
the
finish
is
clean
theres
plenty
of
flavor
more
than
i
expected
after
smelling
it
its
well
balanced
with
a
pretzely
malt
and
a
grassy
herbal
perhaps
minty
bitterness
its
a
session
ale
its
almost
like
an
ale
version
of
a
dortmunder
its
clearly
a
hybrid
of
some
sort
but
not
a
koelsch
and
not
a
california
common
a
delicious
holiday
discovery
all
round
nice
easy
drinking

at

all

copper

were

over
to
the

brewery
to
maintain
the
same
process
and
flavour
apparently
the
yeast
dates
back
to
1776
a
unique
old
school
ale
o
surprisingly
tasty
flavour
given
that
this
ale
uses
golding
styrian
golding

and
admiral
hops
500ml
bottle
has
freshness
date

fairly
dark
amber
colour
with
decent
white
head
the
nose
is
a
combination
of
dired
fruit
lemon
and
honey
seems
a
tad
watery
to
start
until
the
hops
kick
in
then
a
very
pleasant
slightly
oily
feeling
lemony
bitterness
with
an
accompanying
nutty
perahps
hazelnut
element
the
first
time
i
consumed
a
bottle
of
this
i
was
under
the
impression
that
i
was
drinking
brakspear
bitter
and
wondered
what
had
gone
wrong
but
it
has
definitely
grown
on
me
after
a
few
bottles
over
the
last
couple
of
years
o
a
simple
and
lowkey
but
very
wellexecuted
english
beer
balanced
clean
and
not
overthetop
in
any
one
area
but
very
enjoyable
this
was
close
to
expiration
date
i
guess
it
aged
quite
well
very
well
balanced
beer
not
too
heavy
but
not
boring
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
quaff
a
six
pack
thanks
to
billy
for
this
one
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
english
pale
mild
ale
i
will
finish
it
and
if
bought
it
will
drink
but
not
going
to
buy
again
in
a
hurry
a
decent
ale
though
not
amazing
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
and
the
taste
is
wellrounded
could
imagine
sinking
a
few
on
a
hot
day
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
o
a
very
reasonable
spiced
up
lager
not
a
bad
purchase
overall
at
start
i
thought
good
session
beer
then
it
got
too
dry
suspect
will
be
a
glass
of
water
job
to
wash
down
at
end
meh
overall
very
recomended
for
all
purposes
how
is
this
pale
mild
it
says
gold
right
on
the
bottle
some
pungent
hops
some
fruit
and
toast
good
balance
all
around
solid
easy
drinker
cheers
a
well
worth
a
try
quite
fragrant
but
doesnt
beg
you
to
gulp
it
down
lovely
bitter
fruitiness
that
hit
my
sweet
spot
this
evening
overall
refreshing
and
quaffable
but
lacks
body
and
complexity
of
flavour
solid
and
drinkable
beer
overall
nice
session
beer
if
youre
not
a
4

diehard
tool
that
is
d
plenty
in

a
very
nice
solid
english
session
beer
very
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
doesnt
stand
out
as
amazing
but
it
continues
to
grow
on
you
as
you
drink
it
a
good
distinct
bitter
brew
the
brew
is
very
drinkable
and
i
can
see
this
being
a
midweek
regular
d
nothing
to
write
home
about
goes
down
easy
but
with
a
little
extra
twist
in
the
bitterness
a
beer
for
barhopping
d
i
didnt
think
it
was
exceptional
but
it
did
not
fall
short
in
any
category
except
price
although
this
is
definitely
on
the
bitter
end
of
the
scale
for
my
tastes
its
definitely
drinkable
and
ranks
with
similar
ales
like
st
peters
organic
ale
and
tribute
premium
cornish
ale
there
is
a
tang
and
pungency
to
the
taste
bitter
with
an
easy
mixed
fruit
feel
to
it
no
trace
of
any
malt
in
the
flavour
but
it
was
sharp
refreshing
and
invigorating
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
or
night
being
in
this
weight
class
offers
major
sessionability
its
admittedly
not
a
style
i
am
wellversed
in
but
its
an
easy
pour
and
a
solid
foundation
overall
quite
a
nice
epma
the
taste
is
indicated
in
the
style
mild
this
brew
still
has
a
nice
complexity
to
it
it
just
seems
that
everything
is
toned
down
can
easily
make
a
nice
lawnmower
beer
but
at
over
4
00
a
bottle
im
not
sure
ill
be
turning
to
this
again
any
time
soon
final
thoughts
as
many
people
have
commented
this
would
be
a
great
session
ale
its
different
then
the
usual
has
a
low
alcohol
content
and
does
have
an
interesting
influx
of
flavors
going
for
it
also
being
able
to
cleanse
my
pallet
of
the
aftertaste
is
welcome
very
refreshing
nice
biscuity
malts
nice
and
sweet
body
that
finishes
slightly
bitter
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
seems
to
be
fairly
true
to
style
based
on
my
limited
knowledge
certainly
a
session
ale
although
the
sulfur
is
something
im
not
particularly
accustomed
to
or
overly
fond
of
at
this
point
it
would
be
better
suited
to
summer
than
the
depth
of
winter
the
logic
of
the
lcbo
escapes
me
welll
worth
trying
hopefully
this
comes
back
to
ontario
come

not

the

other
comments
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
from
brakspear
and
definitely
a
good
organic
beer
a
good
example
of
this
rather
new
style
a
very
refreshing
welcome
upon
tracking
down
this
pub
on
a
very
warm
and
humid
midtown
toronto
summer
evening
first
impression
is
thats
its
a
touch
light
on
flavour
but
not
too
bad
really
its
like
most
english
pale
milds
a
pleasant
lighter
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
in
the
looks
department
we
have
a
radiant
gold
liquid
with
a
small
white
head
that
soon
diminishes
to
film
and
doesnt
really
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
with
a
hint
of
lemon
almost
a
stock
granite
aroma
you
can
taste
the
wheat
addition
in
the
flavour
which
is
primarily
malt
driven
before
leading
to
a
nicely
hopped
herbal
and
lemon
splashed
finish
a
touch
soapy
but
generally
refreshing
and
light
bodied
it
has
a
good
claim
to
be
a
decent
summer
beer
theres
nothing
too
complex
going
on
but
what
is
happening
is
done
well
the
granite
make
nice
ales
and
i
think
this
one
in
particular
would
benefit
greatly
from
being
put
on
cask
drinkability
easy
to
drink
because
of
how
light
it
is
but
overall
not
that
great
of
a
beer
pours
a
clear

could
drink
a

clean

no

decent
summer
ale
but
below
average
all
around
had
this
at
beerbistro
in
toronto
apparently
as
a
special
dry
hopped
variety
it
was
a
cornyellow
colour
and
quite
cloudy
you
definitely
couldnt
see
through
it
even
with
the
light
colour
it
was
topped
with
a
thin
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
aroma
was
mostly
citrus
which
is
very
appropriate
for
a
summer
ale
but
there
was
also
a
stale
hop
smell
clearly
evident
this
beer
was
very
light
bodied
but
to
the
point
of
being
thin
and
watery
a
little
more
body
would
definitely
help
this
one
out
there
was
also
a
soapy
texture
and
flavour
that
hindered
the
crispness
of
the
citrusy
hops
the
finish
was
harshly
bitter
and
the
aftertaste
built
up
to
an
unpleasant
level
over
the
course
of
the
pint
the
ideas
seemed
to
be
in
place
for
designing
a
refreshing
summer
ale
but
the
execution
didnt
deliver
certainly
worth
trying
especially
if
youre
able
to
get
it
ontap
and
fresh
overall
for
paddock
woods
summer
seasonal
i
feel
this
brew
fell
flat
in
many
areas
including
the
body
which
needs
some
fine
tuning
this
is
good
for
trying
something
different
but
it
doesnt
have
that
umph
factor
above
average
but
not
great
ale
nice
session
ale
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
for
a
light
ale
it
is
big
on
flavours
a
very
easy
drinking
light
ale
decent
for
a
summer
session
but
not
something
i
would
buy
regularly
given
the
vast
selection
out
there
a
decent
mild
pale
ale
it
has
the
flavour
to
punch
a
weight
class
higher
thats
for
sure
and
should
surely
do
nicely
as
a
lower
abv
summer
option
not
sure
the
style
for
this
one
as
i
couldnt
find
it
on
paddock
woods
web
site
but
english
style
ales
named
on
the
bottle
and
i
felt
pale
mild
was
the
best
fit
this
was
a
wild
card
buy
because
it
was
on
the
cheap
nothing
really
to
be
excited
about
here
quite
the
opposite
to
be
honest
very
similar
to
stella
artois
a
skunky
light
and
horrible
taste
the
skunkyness
was
really
the
defining
factor
i
would
be
interested
to
see
if
it
held
up
any
better
away
from
the
clear
bottle
and
would
certainly
consider
a
half
pint
on
tap
otherwise
i
doubt
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
generally
i
would
say
of
even
bad
drinks
that
i
would
take
it
over
a
standard
beer
like
stella
but
in
this
instance
its
so
similar
to
stella
if
it
was
the
choice
between
the
two
i
would
probably
just
opt
for
a
case
of
stella
as
opposed
to
a
similar
number
of
these
and
save
a
few
quid
particularly
bland
english
beer
it
may
tick
some
of
the
admittedly
easy
english
mild
boxes
but
it
really
doesnt
give
you
anything
in
the
package
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
the
missus
would
probably
throw
me
out
a
fairly
average
ale
unexciting
nothing
horrible
but
little
to
stimulate
the
senses
body
is
also
pretty
thin
i
probably
wont
bother
with
this
again
there
are
more
exciting
options
out
there
d
a
pleasant
offering
from
thwaites
i
will
own
up
to
not
being
a
particular
fan
of
their
beers
but
could
quite
happily
down
one
or
two
more
of
these
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
bit
more
complexity
in
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
httpabarwithnoname

com
doesnt
really
seem
to
fit
the
english

on
the
other
hand
it
certainly
isnt
what
i
would
have
expected
from
a
beer

itself
as
gold

that
