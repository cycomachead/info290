taste
palate
as
the
aroma
suggested
it
has
loads
of
malty
sweetness
flowing
over
the
tongue
it
is
bready
and
toasty
as
well
as
sweet
and
candy
like
i
get
all
the
dark
toast
and
caramel
notes
from
the
nose
plus
a
light
roasted
almond
like
nutty
taste
its
palate
feels
smooth
a
little
slick
but
its
light
enough
to
keep
from
being
cloying
the
middle
ages
tasting
room
is
quite
special
about
8
beers
on
tap
every
day
until
6pm
tasting
is
no
charge
and
you
can
taste
all
you
want
not
a
bad
marketing
plan
because
you
will
find
one
or
more
of
their
products
you
will
want
badly
o
a
very
enjoyable
scottish
ale
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
but
with
in
the
style
guidelines
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
nose
this
held
nice
woodiness
booziness
and
fruitiness
and
was
ultimately
nicely
inviting
we
did
however
feel
a
bit
skimped
on
the
flavoring
and
sweetness
that
we
have
come
to
love
the
style
for
instead
the
robust
lighter
and
sweet
malt
profile
was
replaced
by
something
more
akin
to
a
dry
irish
stout
we
found
this
beer
to
be
decent
and
a
pleasant
experience
but
we
were
not
overly
satisfied
or
excited
by
much
at
all
3
5
d
easy
drinking
but
nothing
special
overall
its
good
but
only
makes
me
think
of
middle
ages
delicious
scotch
ale
kilt
tilter
without
delivering
the
fullflavored
punch
its
also
got
a
nice
smoky
presence
that
too
many
american
scottish
beer
stylings
are
lacking
a
solid
offering
and
ill
pick
it
up
when
im
pining
for
its
big
brother
seasonal
by
far
the
best
middle
ages
beer
and
if
it
wasnt
for
ommegang
id
declare
it
the
best
beer
made
in
new
york
state
pours
a
rich
dark
fudge
color
with
w
foamy
white
lacey
head
smells
smokey
and
sweet
bittersweet
like
pure
cacao
and
engligh
malty
like
a
euro
brown
ale
almost
the
flavor
is
just
epic
all
time
a
blend
of
two
styles
scotch
ale
and
porter
there
is
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
a
robust
smokey
sweet
chocolate
malt
thing
up
front
with
a
drawn
out
finish
akin
to
a
good
glass
of
whiskey
almost
tastes
wood
aged
and
that
version
must
be
incredible
but
the
plain
ole
duke
of
winship
is
an
amazing
beer
medium
to
full
body
smooth
as
velvet
brewery
fresh
growler
on
thanksgiving
made
the
day
seek
this
one
out
almost
a
fullbodied
ale
which
is
very
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
middle
ages
makes
some
of
the
best
dark
beers
and
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
all
of
their
dark
beers
including
the
duke
they
dont
call
it
the
duke
for
nothing
this
is
a
damn
good
scotch
aleporter
concoction
highly
recommended
this
beer
makes
me
wish
id
picked
up
more
in
ny
ill
definitely
look
into
when
im
there
next
with
the
balance
tilted
heavily
toward
the
malty
side
the
complexity
of
malt
development
works
well
with
the
bulk
of
attention
given
to
the
more
porterlike
malt
base
any
earthysmokeypeaty
complements
are
slight
the
body
retains
its
weight
very
deep
not
relinquishing
the
sweetness
as
do
many
authentic
scottish
ales
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
maybe
mor
akin
to
a
robust
porter
than
a
scottish
ale
decent
scottish
ale
but
nothing
like
the
real
thing
nothing
really
makes
this
beer
stand
out
average
across
the
board
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
solid
amount
of
offwhite
head
smells
a
bit
off
some
roasted
smells
but
mostly
just
a
odd
smell
tastes
roasted
and
slightly
fruity
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
would
like
but
overall
not
bad
decent
mouthfeel
and
well
carbonated
fairly
drinkable
d
duke
is
pretty
good
the
multi
flavored
aspects
of
the
brew
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
i
would
check
it
out
if
your
interested
in
western
new
york
beers
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
medium
to
thick
body
somewhat
creamy
lower
carbonation
decent
beer
id
definitely
grab
it
again
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
with
a
ruby
hue
in
the
light
one
finger
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
laceing
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
body
is
thick
and
carbonated
taste
is
lighter
than
expected
very
porter
like
roasted
malts
and
grains
bit
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
not
bad
super
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
beer
totally
took
me
by
surprise
with
its
simple
yet
rich
flavors
and
amazing
texture
not
a
classic
example
by
any
means
but
damn
tasty
drinkable
although
a
bit
heavy
i
wouldnt
down
5
of
these
1
or
2
is
fine
this
dark
brown
brew
allows
nearly
zero
light
through
and
carries
a
stable
foamy
greyishtan
head
the
smell
is
semisweet
toasty
smoke
caramel
cherries
the
taste
isnt
as
astringent
or
harsh
as
the
level
of
smoke
in
the
nose
would
imply
in
the
mouth
it
is
a
bit
smoky
but
rounded
and
smooth
semisweet
charred
caramel
woody
earthy
feeling
finishes
with
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
smooth
finishes
dry
a
bit
undercarbonated
a
really
nice
session
beer
anytime
of
year
in
my
opinion
a
nicely
made
beer
and
its
definatly
worth
a
try
middle
ages
makes
some
really
good
beers
i
was
pretty
impressed
there
variety
12
pack
is
definatly
a
good
buy
d
high
considering
i
didnt
love
the
taste
every
beer
from
that
brewery
has
been
very
good
i
dont
particularly
care
for
scotch
ales
or
porters
but
this
is
a
nice
twist
for
less
than
1
50
a
bottle
its
worth
the
price
to
try
it
poured
cold
into
a
pint
glass
this
hybrid
brew
looks
nearly
black
mahogany
in
color
cant
see
through
it
the
halfinch
light
tan
colored
head
settles
to
a
decent
covering
pretty
quickly
and
a
blanket
of
lacing
shows
well
the
aroma
says
licoricemalt
deep
with
molasses
and
some
charcoal
pretty
nice
the
flavor
brings
a
sweet
brown
sugar
malt
and
yeasty
brown
bread
maybe
a
grass
hop
dry
finish
in
there
but
i
think
the
final
analysis
features
a
charcoal
malt
taste
that
comes
with
a
thinnish
bodied
brew
with
some
tinny
highlights
pretty
effervescent
and
drinkable
enough
if
you
like
the
flavor
seems
a
bit
too
thin
and
doesnt
really
capture
the
scotch
ale
qualities
that
the
label
claims
okay
but
not
one
ill
revisit
most
likely
dark
brown
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
chocolate
and
smoked
malts
taste
is
cocoacoffee
beansand
smoked
malts
smooth
and
drinkable
with
good
flavor
this
is
something
i
can
see
buying
again
in
the
future
and
something
i
would
recommend
to
my
buddies
drinkability
a
good
drinkable
version
of
the
style
and
more
like
a
porter
and
darker
than
some
good
for
the
upcoming
winter
it
has
an
ok
appearance
it
pours
black
with
a
good
amount
of
head
and
lacing
however
there
is
this
charcoal
smell
and
taste
that
i
just
cannot
get
over
and
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
its
not
a
really
balanced
dryness
its
just
a
charcoal
and
burnt
fish
style
style
dryness
that
i
cant
get
over
this
is
a
just
plain
undrinkable
dark
ale
and
ive
had
some
good
dark
ales
its
also
quite
light
and
suspiciously
easy
to
take
down
despite
its
big
flavor
profile
im
really
happy
with
this
dark
beer
from
middle
ages
and
of
the
three
ive
tried
from
my
sampler
this
is
definitely
the
best
i
think
this
drinks
a
lot
more
like
a
porter
than
a
scottish
ale
its
almost
a
bit
like
black
hearts
little
brother
its
tasty
and
one
of
middle
ages
best
overall
quite
nice
but
there
might
be
too
much
coffee
for
my
liking
nice
big
body
rich
and
creamy
swirling
leaves
a
viscous
trail
on
the
glass
which
i
really
dig
this
is
a
fine
scotch
ale
highly
drinkable
and
eminently
enjoyable
very
nice
beer
to
me
thanks
to
brothercannon
for
tossing
me
a
bottle
of
this
from
his
variety
pack
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
this
scotch
ale
appears
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
creamy
light
ecru
foam
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nice
and
malty
as
it
should
be
with
notes
of
chocolate
roasted
and
caramelized
grains
bitter
grassy
hops
just
about
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
worth
your
time
if
you
like
the
style
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
porter
than
a
scottish
ale
to
me
the
beer
has
a
decent
taste
thats
worth
trying
sometime
an
interesting
hybrid
a
very
nice
scotch
ale
with
a
porter
character
mixed
in
making
it
a
malty
unique
brew
they
accomplished
what
they
had
planned
to
do
quite
well
id
say
rated
aug
8
2007
d
again
i
love
being
able
to
get
this
on
cask
on
the
regular
the
oak
aged
version
is
a
little
better
as
it
cuts
down
on
the
sweetness
but
this
is
a
real
champ
of
a
drinker
as
well
definitely
grab
anything
you
can
from
middle
ages
on
cask
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
notes
taking
a
step
back
to
observe
this
beer
overall
id
say
middle
ages
did
pretty
well
in
crafting
this
hybrid
scotch
aleenglish
porter
as
the
characteristics
of
both
styles
are
embodied
in
this
brew
worth
a
shot
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
i
poured
this
scottish
aleporter
into
a
victory
pint
glass
at
first
this
beer
appears
to
be
a
jet
black
color
but
a
closer
inspection
led
me
to
believe
that
it
was
more
of
a
cherry
mahogany
brown
with
a
few
small
traces
of
crimson
red
along
the
edges
on
top
of
this
beer
was
light
tan
colored
12
an
inch
head
of
foam
it
had
nice
slow
retention
that
left
behind
a
spotty
tan
film
and
a
small
amount
of
tan
spots
of
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
was
lightly
roasted
with
dry
roasted
coffee
beans
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
a
small
drop
of
pine
and
a
speck
of
of
roasted
barley
at
the
finish
line
nice
porter
aroma
the
taste
however
was
lacking
the
roasted
punch
that
the
aroma
had
it
tasted
like
they
watered
down
the
beer
a
bit
the
taste
started
off
nice
with
roasted
barley
and
roasted
coffee
beans
but
then
the
taste
went
south
after
the
coffee
beans
in
comes
some
water
to
wash
down
the
roasted
flavor
impact
that
the
previous
flavors
gave
the
taste
it
did
end
with
a
nice
crispy
floral
hoppy
finish
though
but
it
was
the
water
that
ruined
the
taste
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
crispy
yet
roasted
aftertaste
of
roasted
malts
a
splash
of
caramel
a
hint
of
coffee
beans
and
a
small
touch
of
roasted
floral
hops
in
the
end
it
was
a
great
looking
porter
a
great
smelling
porter
but
an
average
tasting
porter
a
wonderful
brew
for
the
chill
coming
in
the
fall
d
this
is
a
good
drinking
scottish
ale
im
sure
i
could
drink
this
all
night
d
ive
never
had
anything
like
it
but
this
hybrid
scotch
aleporter
works
very
well
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
it
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
here
is
average
middle
ages
is
my
closest
brewery
and
i
give
them
props
for
crafting
an
interesting
variety
of
brews
there
are
much
better
scottish
ales
out
there
and
middle
ages
own
highlander
80
shilling
is
better
not
a
bad
call
though
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
redpurple
with
3
fingers
of
foamy
light
tan
colored
head
nice
retention
and
some
clinging
lacing
smells
of
caramel
cinnamon
chocolate
nuts
and
roasted
malt
tastes
of
citrus
briefly
up
front
then
nuts
and
caramel
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
grapes
and
chocolate
finishes
with
roasted
malt
coffee
and
slight
grassy
bitterness
medium
in
body
with
nice
carbonation
very
dry
with
some
acidity
to
it
finally
a
middle
ages
beer
that
i
dont
think
tastes
like
butter
a
good
combination
of
flavors
for
a
unique
tasting
scottish
ale
d
pretty
drinkable
i
like
the
mix
of
scotch
and
porter
it
makes
for
a
real
nice
combination
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
two
fingers
of
tan
head
which
slowly
dissipate
leaving
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
of
hazlenuts
and
malt
taste
to
match
with
some
bitterness
and
roastiness
present
and
a
dry
crisp
finish
light
mouthfeel
with
good
drinkability
dgood
roasted
malt
body
but
a
little
to
dry
in
the
finish
for
me
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
with
a
rocky
two
finger
light
tan
colored
head
spotty
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
nice
looking
brew
smell
is
a
scotchy
ringwood
with
notes
of
coffee
and
caramel
sweet
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
with
roasted
grains
that
tickle
the
nose
as
well
smokey
chocolate
malt
and
toffee
on
the
tongue
at
first
followed
by
a
hint
of
scotch
and
oak
flavors
the
ringwood
yeast
taste
fits
in
very
well
with
this
beer
and
doesnt
over
power
in
the
least
bit
aftertaste
is
of
coffee
and
cane
sugar
that
leaves
the
tongue
slightly
dry
medium
to
full
body
with
a
very
smooth
feel
carbonation
is
slight
and
tingles
the
mouth
this
is
probably
one
of
middle
ages
better
beers
although
it
doesnt
get
much
recognition
because
of
the
style
its
just
not
imperial
enough
ill
have
to
get
this
on
cask
one
of
these
days
at
the
tusk
i
saw
this
hybrid
and
had
to
try
it
pours
a
deep
rubybrown
w
a
creamy
tan
head
which
lasted
a
good
while
leaving
a
moderate
lacing
in
my
nonic
smells
mostly
like
a
porter
darkly
toasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
but
has
a
faint
smoked
whiskey
and
butterscotch
note
to
it
as
well
taste
is
similar
to
smell
a
robust
deep
roasted
malt
flavor
a
bit
sweet
w
a
woody
slightly
vinous
alcoholic
finish
a
med
body
moderate
co2
yet
still
bubbles
all
the
way
down
a
quite
drinkable
yet
confusing
brew
i
def
have
to
get
more
of
this
one
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
bottle
of
duke
of
winship
it
wasnt
completely
unpleasant
in
fact
if
was
labelled
belgianstyle
and
barrell
aged
i
would
have
scored
it
highly
the
fact
is
i
got
an
infected
bottle
even
with
the
unintentional
funk
it
showed
promise
but
i
just
cant
give
it
a
good
score
i
guess
this
beer
exemplifies
the
style
but
the
fruitness
would
have
me
move
on
after
one
nice
simple
well
crafted
beer
finished
with
a
mild
bitterness
from
the
hops
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
was
pretty
well
balanced
an
enjoyable
beer
not
bad
i
remember
not
liking
a
previous
bottle
as
well
as
i
liked
this
one
so
perhaps
the
6
months
age
on
it
did
it
some
good
cheers
it
involved
many
of
the
same
characteristics
of
similar
beers
of
this
style
but
more
so
scottish
ales
do
not
tend
to
normally
rank
highly
with
my
taste
but
this
was
good
the
label
states
that
this
is
basically
a
cross
between
a
scottish
ale
and
a
porter
yep
thats
pretty
much
what
it
is
and
pretty
good
too
give
em
props
for
trying
something
fairly
unique
overall
i
have
to
say
im
fairly
impressed
im
not
sure
i
personally
can
pick
apart
the
scottish
ale
aspect
of
it
but
i
havent
had
too
many
of
those
to
really
be
an
expert
either
way
it
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
distinct
personality
recommended
d
a
generally
tasty
brew
with
sweetness
offset
by
roasted
elements
the
dry
almost
burnt
powdery
taste
is
slightly
distracting
but
overall
a
pleasant
malty
dark
ale
very
thick
and
has
a
nice
dry
finish
a
thick
feel
on
the
tongue
at
the
end
slightly
ashy
even
yet
surprisingly
smooth
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
has
a
pucker
to
it
but
a
nice
dry
balance
overall
a
very
tasty
and
complex
scottish
ale
good
porter
characteristics
highly
recommended
pumps
a
nice
deep
tan
foam
that
settles
into
a
nearly
black
beer
wispy
thin
brown
foam
on
top
im
a
little
confused
as
to
what
style
beer
this
is
porter
or
scottish
ale
it
has
the
look
and
feel
of
a
lighter
porter
but
the
sweetness
of
a
scottish
ale
slightly
roasted
and
malty
but
very
sweet
and
a
little
bit
thin
in
the
aftertaste
some
sort
of
hybrid
beer
imo
interesting
the
pour
produced
a
creamy
dense
thick
foam
head
that
was
tan
in
color
and
fairly
sticky
to
the
touch
as
it
was
drank
it
produced
a
fairly
decent
lace
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aromas
the
emerged
from
the
glass
were
of
sweet
fruit
apples
grapes
etc
roasted
dark
malt
nuts
coffee
some
bitter
chocolate
and
tones
of
fresh
earth
as
it
warmed
the
fruit
and
coffee
seem
to
be
more
pronounced
the
flavors
produced
slightly
different
tastes
then
the
aroma
would
have
hinted
to
simple
array
of
hops
pine
roasted
malts
fresh
coffee
notes
of
dark
chocolate
more
hops
in
the
middle
hints
of
fruit
arose
and
disappeared
fairly
fast
slate
and
hay
as
it
ended
the
aftertaste
was
of
a
burntbitter
chocolate
and
coffee
mixture
dry
the
body
was
on
the
thinner
side
a
tad
watery
not
what
i
would
have
expected
would
have
liked
some
body
for
a
beer
like
this
after
being
aged
left
in
the
fridge
for
2
years
it
seems
to
have
held
up
fairly
well
when
fresh
it
seemed
to
have
more
body
but
even
in
its
current
state
it
is
very
drinkable
but
to
be
honest
i
would
have
never
guessed
this
to
be
a
scottish
ale
when
i
poured
it
i
if
i
didnt
know
would
have
thought
it
be
a
porter
or
in
that
family
i
did
buy
it
again
and
was
even
more
impressed
than
the
first
time
i
tasted
it
overall
a
smooth
beer
that
eased
up
as
it
went
on
i
might
not
buy
it
again
but
i
am
glad
that
i
did
try
it
give
it
a
shot
d
very
easy
to
drink
nice
smooth
flavor
but
the
heat
of
it
makes
it
a
little
rough
bottle
from
lubière
poured
a
dark
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
good
retention
aroma
is
quite
strong
with
peat
and
bitter
roasted
malt
taste
is
reminiscent
of
a
mix
between
a
scotch
ale
and
a
porter
with
a
nice
dose
of
peat
that
mix
very
well
with
roasted
bitter
malt
with
a
nice
sweet
touch
body
is
above
average
and
medium
level
of
alcohol
makes
it
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
often
very
nice
beer
that
doesnt
seem
to
fall
under
a
particular
style
the
smooth
creamy
mouth
feel
made
this
brew
a
nice
rich
sipper
that
i
enjoyed
over
the
thirtyfive
minute
ride
home
glad
i
picked
up
extras
at
a
buck
a
bottle
this
was
a
steal
had
this
brew
from
a
growler
poured
to
a
dark
brown
color
which
let
very
little
light
through
fair
sized
dark
tan
head
that
has
pretty
good
retention
and
did
leave
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
strong
caramel
malt
aromas
giving
it
a
sweet
scent
with
a
slight
alcohol
smell
the
taste
seems
to
be
more
about
the
malt
than
anything
else
caramel
with
a
candy
like
taste
dominate
but
i
do
sense
a
slight
hop
finish
over
all
it
is
a
good
brew
not
a
favorite
but
one
i
would
get
again
dark

faint

too
of

this

after
all
gotta
love
the
way
they
use
that
ringwood
roasted

dark

malts
herbal

keep

and
there
is

at
the
finish
unexpectedly
diacetyl
does
not
show
much
in
the
taste
rich

and
creamy
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
seems
to
be
more
of
a
scotch
ale
by
the
nose
and
more
of
a
robust
porter
by
the
taste
and
palate
id
really
like
to
try
this
on
tap
definitely
a
buyagain
beer
great
stuff
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
malt
caramel
but
hint
of
bread
and
brown
sugar
are
also
detectable
i
swear
this
was
a
dark
reddish
brown
when
poured
but
it
turns
dark
black
with
a
somewhat
creamy
but
mostly
bubbly
head
some
mildly
smoky
flavors
in
the
fore
with
hints
of
carmelized
roast
beef
proceed
a
sweet
mildly
chocolatecocoa
powder
middle
and
vaguely
molasses
tinged
finish
a
different
and
worthy
approach
to
the
style
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
hearty
beer
from
a
scotch
ale
smooth
sweet
and
hearty
my
kind
of
beer
thanks
to
dmeadows
for
this
just
returned
from
a
friday
night
high
school
football
game
in
the
cold
and
it
seemed
like
a
nice
time
for
a
scottish
ale
poured
a
very
deep
mahogany
color
with
adequate
tannish
head
that
feel
to
a
nice
ring
smell
is
nice
and
roasty
with
notes
of
caramel
present
taste
follows
through
with
more
roasted
notes
and
some
dark
fruity
tastes
also
present
finished
very
mild
with
a
moderate
sweet
maltiness
and
no
hops
to
be
found
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
however
it
seemed
more
like
a
porter
stegmaiers
than
a
scottish
ale
overall
this
is
a
beer
to
try
for
any
dark
beer
fan
im
more
of
a
porter
lover
than
scotch
ale
and
generally
think
of
it
as
a
porter
but
that
doesnt
matter
this
is
just
a
good
solid
beer
thats
damn
tasty
and
treats
you
right
i
find
its
generally
fullerbodied
and
tasting
ontap
than
bottle
enjoyed
with
good
ol
redbones
bbq
nice
choice
a
beer
really
under
my
radar
im
happy
it
was
in
the
sampler
case
look
forward
to
revisiting
beer
is
good
happy
free
blended
beering
this
beer
looked
nice
enough
but
it
started
thin
and
got
thinner
with
each
sip
the
malt
element
wasnt
there
for
long
before
it
dropped
away
to
an
equally
fastebbing
hops
component
in
all
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
nothing
special
either
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
my
guess
is
there
is
likely
better
available
for
the
next
one
maybe
i
was
wrong
in
expecting
more
but
i
thought
it
was
a
disappointment
thanks
to
shippos
for
bringing
this
one
my
way
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
a
smoky
character
with
some
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
nice
has
a
strong
maltiness
and
a
bit
of
smoked
malt
that
is
supposed
to
be
there
in
a
scotch
ale
the
smoked
malt
seems
to
be
left
out
of
a
lot
of
the
readily
available
scotch
ales
that
ive
had
recently
drinks
easily
and
the
body
is
moderate
dark
brown
body
with
a
small
tan
cap
bits
of
lace
strewn
about
the
glass
as
this
was
taken
down
deep
sweet
fruit
notes
with
an
unusually
large
roastiness
for
the
style
some
chocolate
malt
and
a
dash
of
coffee
definitely
smell
more
of
a
hybrid
than
the
standard
but
it
smell
damn
tasty
flavor
is
kicked
off
with
dark
sweet
fruits
with
a
strong
roasted
malt
upfront
pretty
big
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
light
alcohol
is
noticeable
as
is
some
caramel
quite
the
malt
bomb
going
on
here
in
a
very
complex
and
tasty
way
strong
lingering
roasty
notes
about
a
medium
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
very
drinkable
stuff
this
threw
me
off
at
first
put
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
was
loving
the
stuff
not
your
typical
scotch
ale
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
ruby
hue
there
is
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
very
healthy
coat
over
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
full
of
deep
rich
caramel
with
a
bit
of
peated
malt
the
flavor
moderately
coffee
and
slightly
smokey
its
okay
but
not
what
i
consider
for
a
scotch
the
feel
is
a
on
the
light
side
of
moderate
overall
this
beer
is
very
nice
i
would
definatley
try
it
again
but
not
for
a
scotch
oncask
at
the
blue
tusk
damn
does
this
brew
improve
on
the
handpump
or
what
a
dark
brew
nearly
black
with
a
huge
for
a
handpull
head
of
espressolike
foam
this
brew
is
fresh
in
fact
this
cask
was
just
tapped
two
days
prior
to
my
arrival
at
the
tusk
the
aromas
scream
porter
but
there
are
scotch
ale
undertones
as
well
i
detect
a
bit
of
somked
peat
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
roasted
malts
chocolate
caramel
and
a
bit
of
the
ole
booze
as
well
taste
is
great
creamy
roasty
with
chocolate
caramel
and
coffee
notes
all
over
the
place
wow
decadent
is
the
word
to
sum
up
this
drinking
experience
mouthfeel
is
cask
loveliness
and
drinkability
is
insane
as
well
all
of
this
in
a
20oz
serving
size
for
just
3
man
sometimes
you
really
have
to
love
the
cuse
duke
of
winship
might
have
been
better
served
and
would
have
been
the
stuff
of
legends
if
it
adhered
more
rigorously
to
the
scottish
ale
guidelines
its
still
mighty
fine
beer
and
is
one
of
middle
agess
best
my
thanks
to
happyhourhero
for
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
nice
body
and
small
bubbly
carbonation
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
one
is
enjoyable
and
i
could
sit
down
to
a
few
thanks
to
dmeadows
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
thanks
to
cmaruschak
for
the
trade
pours
a
dark
reddish

color
with
a
medium
thin
offwhite
head
that
has
fair
retention
thin
and
sticky
lacing
strong
roasted
malt
aroma
with
touches
of
caramel
and
fruit
pretty
fullbodied
and
i
like
the
style
that
blends
characteristics
of
a
scotch
ale
and
porter
although
to
be
honest
if
i
didnt
read
the
label
i
would
have
guessed
just
scotch
ale
nice
roasty
flavor
with
malt
dark
fruit
caramel
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
finish
is
a
little
smokey
and
has
a
nice
bitterness
enjoyable
brew
great
great
beer
the
duke
welcomes
you
with
a
little
note
on
the
bottle
how
nice
not
to
sound
wrong
but
the
duke
is
welcome
in
my
mouth
anytime
its
a
dark
brown
red
if
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
a
ring
around
the
glass
of
tiny
tan
bubbles
smells
roasty
like
coffee
with
brown
sugar
in
it
i
love
it
tastes
sweetish
butterscotchy
brown
sugary
coffee
yeah
slightly
bitter
end
like
something
roasted
would
be
mouthfeel
is
lovely
fizzy
enough
so
it
doesnt
get
to
be
too
much
drinkability
is
good
as
well
yes
unfortunately
i
only
had
one
bottle
to
split
i
guess
ill
just
have
to
go
back
to
the
brewery
to
pet
the
kitty
bubbles
and
get
more
duke

nice
roast

am
i
the
only
one
to
notice
the
correct

on
the

side

very
fresh
from
the

nice

after
the
fact

what
a
nice

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
olivers
beverage
albany
ny
this
is
the
first
real
beer
i
have
had
in
such
a
long
time
that
i
am
overwhelmed
by
what
were
once
daily
pleasures
for
me
in
the
realm
of
beer
drinking
first
of
all
the
beer
looks
quite
amazing
in
the
pint
it
is
almost
jet
black
on
first
inspection
but
look
closer
and
theres
a
beautiful
red
tint
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
head
was
a
thick
light
tan
about
half
a
finger
and
receded
rather
quickly
into
an
inviting
ring
although
with
little
lace
the
smell
is
mostly
roasted
malts
with
some
slight
amount
of
hop
undertones
there
is
also
a
delicate
fruity
burnt
aroma
the
taste
is
pleasant
and
warming
or
maybe
thats
the
alcohol
although
some
of
the
flavors
are
too
unpronounced
it
melds
together
into
a
nice
overall
taste
but
its
a
bit
sharp
on
the
back
of
the
palatte
and
i
find
myself
wishing
for
a
bit
more
malt
presence
dont
mistake
this
for
complaining
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
i
plan
to
the
mouthfeel
is
straightforward
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
and
plenty
of
small
bubbles
drinkability
theres
plenty
especially
since
i
got
it
for
free
let
the
drinking
commence
i
dont
really
care
for
the
consistency
too
carbonated
or
something
flavors
are
somewhat
harsh
and
not
well
balanced
overflowing
with
smoky
character
that
i
dont
find
appealing
drinkability
great
dinner
brew
or
after
dinner
sipping
even
i
must
thank
my
boss
for
getting
me
a
case
of
this
stuff
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
dense
12
tan
head
formed
which
laced
excellently
brew
is
quite
dark
with
a
reddish
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
heavily
sweet
malty
aroma
almost
has
a
slight
milk
tinge
to
it
whatever
that
means
taste
is
stunning
the
smoothness
and
heartiness
of
a
porter
coupled
with
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
warming
of
my
favorite
style
at
this
point
the
scotch
ale
taste
did
deteriorate
a
bit
as
warming
occured
during
the
drinking
experience
but
nothing
too
drastic
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
excellent
as
well
a
tremendous
categorybreaker
from
those
wizards
at
middle
ages
drinkability
is
very
nice
interesting
twist
on
style
blending
very
nice
beer
a
cross
between
a
scottish
ale
and
a
porter
and
it
shows
in
the
pour
of
this
beer
a
deep
brown
with
a
few
red
highlights
not
much
head
to
speak
ofaroma
is
earthy
and
fruity
with
a
trace
of
bitter
chocolate
a
good
combonation
in
my
book
taste
has
a
nice
dried
fruit
flavor
up
front
with
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
that
dominates
with
a
real
medicinal
finish
wich
was
unexpected
a
nice
beer
with
some
complexity
a
nice
night
cap
edit
had
a
12
gallon
growler
still
feel
like
its
a
muddled
and
mediocre
porter
a
deep
soulless
brown
color
filled
my
pint
glass
sweet
roast
caramel
flavors
with
lingering
hints
of
hops
and
chocolate
malt
fill
the
mouth
this
beer
has
a
fairly
straightforward
character
that
i
ascribe
to
most
lagers
as
i
finished
the
pint
the
beer
became
more
tart
and
i
didnt
notice
any
fruit
qualities
i
dont
really
see
the
scotch
ale
in
this
scotch
porter
blend
i
taste
black
malt
more
then
peat
flavored
malt
i
agree
with
the
a
few
others
this
beer
is
very
much
like
a
porter
but
it
does
have
the
nice
scottish
qualities
i
love
nice
head
and
good
lacing
and
really
nice
cherryauburn
red
color
when
held
directly
in
front
of
my
desk
lamp
really
nice
smokey
and
peaty
qualities
and
tasty
toasted
and
mocha
chocolate
finish
of
a
porter
also
does
have
a
nice
slick
buttery
taste
tying
the
two
together
really
suprisingly
good
the
smell
is
mostly
alcohol
with
a
little
bit
of
smoke
the
taste
is
totally
dominated
by
the
smoke
with
the
alcohol
not
far
behind
malt
profile
is
not
all
that
dark
but
the
alcohol
masks
its
flavor
making
it
taste
darker
than
it
really
is
slighlty
overcarbonated
for
a
beer
that
is
trying
to
be
an
old
ale
andor
porter
drinkability
make
sure
you
always
have
a
couple
of
these
stashed
away
for
when
you
have
a
hankering
for
an
interesting
blend
of
ale
styles
its
good
out
of
the
bottle
but
on
tap
it
seems
that
the
flavors
play
nice
together
making
it
more
interesting
if
you
are
in
an
area
that
has
bottles
of
ma
make
the
effort
and
find
a
bar
where
you
can
pick
up
ther
growler
its
worth
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
burgandy
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
stays
strong
the
aroma
is
an
intense
mixture
of
ringwood
yeast
roasted
barley
chocolate
malts
and
patent
malts
truly
excellant
the
taste
is
very
unique
you
get
that
buttery
feeling
as
it
goes
down
but
there
is
that
dark
grain
element
that
adds
such
complexity
to
the
palate
it
does
have
a
lot
of
porter
qualities
to
it
but
i
like
a
beer
that
is
willing
to
push
to
envelope
a
little
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
although
it
is
medium
to
heavily
bodied
this
one
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
think
ill
have
another
ahh
it
got
cold
again
so
i
have
been
relagated
to
drinking
the
warming
ales
the
duke
poured
a
regal
brown
with
a
huge
crowning
cafe
au
lait
head
this
receded
into
a
very
intricate
and
sticky
lace
it
was
very
porter
like
in
appearence
with
no
light
seeping
through
the
glass
the
smell
was
also
very
porterish
with
sweet
chocolate
malts
and
burned
currant
flavors
it
was
bordering
cloying
in
the
nose
but
not
quite
the
taste
had
a
very
interesting
thing
going
on
there
were
some
real
huge
robust
porter
flavors
of
toffee
and
coffee
with
seriously
roasted
malts
but
it
mellowed
into
a
much
more
scottish
ale
type
bear
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
with
blood
red
cherry
and
burned
sugar
fruits
there
was
just
a
touch
of
hops
towards
the
finish
the
scotch
qualities
improved
the
further
down
it
got
with
a
much
more
warming
mellow
scotch
flavor
appearing
the
mouthfeel
was
all
ale
with
bubbley
carbonation
that
was
a
little
too
fizzy
i
would
like
a
more
flat
mouthfeel
but
not
creamy
like
a
malty
stout
or
porter
more
like
a
dubbel
this
beer
is
however
recomended
i
am
only
just
getting
into
the
scottish
styles
wow
this
beer
is
great
even
before
tasting
it
a
nice
khakicolored
head
settles
to
a
thing
layer
and
provides
excellent
lacing
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
brown
color
not
completely
opaque
i
was
lost
in
the
smell
just
breathing
it
in
an
enjoying
it
and
i
lost
control
and
had
to
sip
it
oak
berries
and
chocolate
aromas
smokey
too
tastes
very
smooth
some
chocolate
and
burnt
flavors
creamy
and
the
aftertaste
is
lighter
than
expected
wonderful
beer
if
you
ever
see
this
beer
available
on
cask
run
dont
walk
to
try
it
one
of
the
better
handpulled
pints
ive
ever
had
a
salute
to
syrbeer
for
introducing
me
to
the
duke
i
really
liked
this
beer
from
the
bottle
design
to
the
last
drop
blackest
tones
with
hardly
any
light
showing
through
the
glass
foam
was
even
brownishtan
did
not
perceive
much
of
a
scotchstyled
nose
bottle
seems
to
hint
that
this
one
is
something
of
a
crossstyled
brew
bids
you
welcome
with
smooth
flavor
of
a
scottish
ale
capped
with
the
regal
flourish
of
a
porter
taste
also
was
consistent
throughout
the
session
burnt
roasted
malts
with
some
sweetness
noticeable
alcohol
and
a
very
hint
of
peat
smokiness
great
balance
and
taste
wellcrafted
the
quintessential
porter
pour
a
very
deep
brown
to
almost
black
in
color
the
head
regal
as
it
crowns
the
beer
all
nice
and
chocolate
brown
creamy
in
texture
and
the
residual
lace
fine
sticky
sheets
to
coat
the
glass
light
toasted
grain
aroma
with
sweet
cotton
candy
like
tones
buttery
a
real
treat
to
the
senses
the
front
is
malt
sweet
the
top
middling
in
feel
the
finish
has
a
splendid
hop
presence
the
carbonation
moderate
and
the
bittersweet
chocolate
dry
aftertaste
a
pleasing
seal
to
this
quite
quaffable
beer
thanks
to
davo
for
this
regal
treat
dark

almost
impenetrable
solid

aroma
with
strong
grasses
and
herbs
others
have
commented
how
this
beer
falls
in
between
a
scottish
ale
and
a
porter
and
that
is
a
fine
description
some
upfront
flavors
have
the
smoky
grassy
malts
that
are
characteristic
in
a
scottish
ale
and
then
the
creaminess
and
dry
finish
as
well
as
a
lingering
of
coffee
and
roasted
barley
flavors
indicate
the
porter
excellent
tasty
warming
energizing
revitalizing
this
beer
should
probably
be
treated
as
a
porter
since
scottish
ales
are
delicate
smoky
and
excellent
as
an
after
dinner
drink
this
beer
has
rougher
edges
but
could
in
turn
be
as
useful
as
any
good
porter
the
best
of
the
middle
ages
beers
i
have
tried
excellent

for

overall

that
i
had

with
spotty

at
typical
porter
dark
roasted

slight

bitter
roast
kinda
watery
with
a

finish
will
finish
the
six
pack
with
no

but
problay
wont
get
it
again
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
the
description
is
just
about
100
accurate
carbonation
seems
a
little
high
head
fades
but
comes
back
quickly
with
a
little
swirl
i
would
like
to
give
this
beer
a
chance
to
get
to
room
temperature
next
time
i
think
the
flavors
would
mellow
together
sweetness
is
different
english
style
toffee
well
worth
a
try

a

its

the

is
awesome
my
expectations

were

needed

to
boost

they

is

and
harsh
for
me
the
peoples
porter
a
beer
for
the
people
this
beer
is
exactly
what
its
name
implies
a
nice
solid
hard
working
beer
it
tastes
of
the
black
morning
coffee
of
a
salaryman
the
bread
of
a
factory
workers
lunch
and
even
a
few
notes
of
a
caramel
or
vanilla
like
the
manager
might
sneak
at
the
end
of
the
day
all
in
all
the
proletariat
as
well
as
foothills
should
be
proud
to
call
this
their
beer
its
one
of
the
more
drinkable
porters
i
have
found
due
to
its
pleasant
balance
of
flavors
and
relatively
speaking
for
a
porter
low
gravity
it
is
especially
good
for
finishing
off
a
six
pack
by
yourself
while
watching
football
avoiding
your
extended
family
and
waiting
for
daybeforethanksgiving
dinner
to
be
made
overall
this
bottle
has
been
in
my
cellar
for
a
while
so
the
hops
have
faded
but
that
is
just
fine
with
me
as
i
find
foothills
dark
beers
tend
to
be
a
bit
hoppy
for
my
palate
i
like
the
way
this
has
aged
just
fine
t
lots
of
roasted
malt
with
some
day
old
coffee
and
some
citrusy
hops
trying
to
pull
through
the
malt
finish
gives
a
touch
of
toffee
hop
resin
and
some
charred
espresso
seems
like
the
flavors
start
to
fall
apart
a
bit
as
it
warms
but
this
is
a
pretty
solid
porter
glad
i
got
to
try
this
o
a
straightforward
porter
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
among
others
but
is
solid
enough
i
guess
thats
why
its
the
peoples
porter
poured
a
deep
rubytinted
brown
with
a
pillowy
tan
head
the
head
has
incredible
retention
and
leaves
substantial
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
maltlovers
dream
with
big
roasted
notes
of
coffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
the
aroma
is
similar
but
includes
some
mild
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
the
beer
feels
a
little
light
on
the
palate
but
not
so
much
that
i
would
call
it
watery
a
great
big
flavor
english
porter
o
a
decent
porter
if
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
it
wouold
be
top
notch
still
pretty
good
and
very
drinkable
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
didnt
blow
my
mind
in
any
way
but
a
well
done
porter
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
i
love
a
good
porter
rjt

very
inviting
flavors
are

bitter

roasted
with
some

very

good

o
its
not

but
its
not

either
there
are
better
dark

options
for
this
price
range
a
fluffy
caramel
head
rests
on

of
an
onixcolored
body
i
spilled
a
little
onto
my
hands
and
they
now
smell
like
mexican
hot
chocolate
cinnamon
chocolate
malts
maple
syrup
and
a
touch
of
coffee
liquor
are
all
present
in
the
nose
the
full
taste
is
packed
with
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
anise
seed
lacings
grace
the
side
of
the
glass
like
spider
webs
i
will
grant
that
this
is
a
solid
porter
o
a
decent
if
not
amazing
robust
porter
the
hops
here
work
better
than
some
others
in
the
style
still
i
wish
some
more
of
the
malt
character
came
through
overall
the
nose
hints
at
real
solid
greatness
but
doesnt
deliver
the
sensations
on
the
palate
at
all
that
the
bouquet
hints
at
some
faint
tin
and
sourness
also
takes
it
down
a
notch
in
enjoyment
its
ok
but
i
have
had
a
lot
better
porters
than
this
appears
opaque
dark
brown
capped
with
a
cratered
tan
head
that
thins
after
a
couple
minutes
smells
more
of
fruity
esters
than
expected
then
the
usual
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
come
through
almost
alternating
dark
roasted
coffee
and
dry
cocoa
dominate
the
flavor
leaving
the
mouth
a
bit
chalky
finishes
plenty
bitter
medium
body
and
carb
where
it
should
be
its
drinkable
but
dont
hurt
yourself
seeking
this
out
feel
medium
to
full
bodied
smooth
and
very
tasty
notes
of
espresso
coffee
linger
on
the
palate
o
nice
offering
from
this
nc
brewery
cheers
o
another
great
beer
from
foothills
not
something
i
would
buy
all
the
time
but
definitely
something
i
would
buy
again
o
a
good
generic
porter
aroma
is
spot
on
but
taste
and
mouthfeel
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
o
a
very
solid
porter
straight
forward
and
an
easy
drinker
this
is
worth
a
taste
but
its
really
not
exceptional
supposedly
its
an
english
porter
but
i
think
foothills
added
dirt
instead
of
rocks
im
sure
that
comment
will
make
sense
to
at
least
one
person
this
may
or
may
not
pair
with
a
piece
of
poontang
pie
good
for
porter
smells
a
bit
weak
but
the
taste
and
overall
drinkability
make
it
worth
seeking
out
again
solid
all
around
d
this
was
a
solid
porter
with
a
basic
but
very
enjoyable
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
fitting
for
the
style
and
the
finish
was
pretty
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
solid
brew

for
a
porter
and
especially
considering
the
appearance
its
a
little
thin
its
more
something
underlying
as
it
begins
with
a
firm
heft
but
something
falls
off
as
it
goes
it
has
a
crispness
that
isnt
too
much
and
is
smooth
enough
to
satisfy
if
only
it
didnt
have
that
thinness
in
the
body
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
to
light
black
with
a
soft
tan
head
of
tiny
soft
bubbles
the
head
leaves
a
lacing
of
slippery
spittle
droplets
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
body
is
indecipherable
in
its
darkness
but
shows
some
light
molasseslike
colors
on
its
edges
that
seem
clean
of
particles
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
light
roasted
coffee
with
a
kiss
of
mocha
and
dark
chocolate
milk
chocolate
also
briefly
touches
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
of
bitter
roast
with
a
kiss
of
hops
sweetness
is
also
prevalent
from
the
malts
though
subdued
and
more
chocolaty
than
sugary
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
warm
roasted
chocolate
which
blossoms
into
roasted
coffee
moving
from
light
roast
to
dark
roast
and
filling
the
mouth
with
a
nice
bitter
roasted
flavor
with
slight
hints
of
raisins
and
dark
fruit
in
among
the
roast
the
finish
carries
a
slight
flavor
of
ice
and
metal
oddly
enough
with
a
dying
bitter
roasted
coffee
flavor
that
hints
at
chocolate
and
some
slight
earthiness
that
balances
out
the
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
of
lingering
bitter
roasted
coffee
and
char
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
in
body
and
perhaps
even
lighter
though
the
beer
does
carry
a
little
heaviness
in
the
swallow
carbonation
is
soft
and
almost
fluffy
on
the
mouth
and
the
mouth
is
left
roasted
dry
overall
this
is
a
pretty
classic
american
porter
there
is
nothing
fancy
about
it
but
its
tasty
it
has
its
chocolate
it
has
its
bitters
and
it
has
its
roasted
coffee
flavors
a
nice
porter
for
when
you
want
something
simple

there
is

mild
amount

on
the

this
is
a
very
solid
porter
and
i
bet
itd
be
pretty
gnarly
on
nitro
smooth
enough
without
losing
any
of
its
roast
or
bitterness
and
maintaining
a
dry
finish
with
levity
this
is
a
really
easy
to
drink
porter
for
those
who
enjoy
the
style
for
those
who
arent
into
dark
beers
this
may
not
be
a
good
intro
but
for
those
who
are
this
is
definitely
a
tasty
accessible
and
very
affordable
option
o
good
flavor
but
heavy
on
the
roast
and
low
on
complexity
overall
a
pretty
solid
porter
good
and
favorable
nothing
over
the
top
just
as
it
should
be
i
like
this
beer
but
it
is
not
great
it
is
a
regular
in
my
rotation
due
to
its
availabity
in
my
area
it
is
an
easy
drinking
porter
with
decent
taste
only
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
and
it
has
a
slight
burnt
aftertaste
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
still
it
a
decent
attempt
at
an
english
style
porter
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
porter
if
it
was
a
little
heavier
it
could
be
considered
a
stout
ill
gladly
drink
it
anytime
i
love
this
beer
chocolate
malts
present
as
its
poured
into
a
tumbler
very
good
head
and
lacing
aftertaste
is
very
nice
chocolate
malts
finish
abv
is
low
enough
to
have
a
few
and
still
be
on
point
most
porters
are
too
light
for
my
tastes
but
this
porter
has
a
pretty
full
body
color
is
dark
and
almost
completely
black
taste
is
thick
but
not
overly
thick
just
right
really
for
the
style
the
smell
is
toffee
some
dried
fruit
coffee
but
not
much
and
cocoa
that
is
what
i
find
to
be
the
strongest
element
of
this
one
it
is
a
well
balanced
porter
with
a
lot
of
chocolate
notes
to
it
it
is
sweet
but
once
again
not
cloying
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
porters
i
have
ever
had
and
i
do
enjoy
this
style
a
great
deal
the
beers
overall
enjoyment
is
high
but
falls
inconsistent
first
in
its
recipe
formulation
that
over
extends
its
flirtation
with
stout
and
then
leaves
the
mouthfeel
thin
to
boot
happy
as
i
would
be
to
drink
the
beer
again
i
would
be
careful
not
to
group
the
beer
with
the
likes
of
sexual
chocolate
or
hoppyyum
ipa
stronger
scents
and
less
watery
in
the
finish
and
this
could
be
a
great
one
one
of
my
favorite
goto
local
beers
in
the
winter
rich
malts
with
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
tones
nice
mellow
bitterness
full
body
that
clings
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
good
legs
just
a
slight
dirty
garnet
glint
when
held
up
to
the
light
mild
hops
that
balances
out
the
rich
malts
overall
pretty
good
nice
malts
decent
light
hop
balance
quite
creamy
and
smooth
nice
chocolate
and
light
roast
but
it
does
get
a
bit
too
acrid
as
it
goes
poured
from
growler
into
a
pint
glass
very
attractive
pour
with
an
almost
black
appearance
very
lively
with
a
generous
2finger
mocca
head
that
hung
around
for
a
bit
almost
stout
looking
smell
was
very
woody
and
earthy
burnt
notes
perhaps
some
figs
and
carmel
taste
is
very
similar
but
getting
a
lot
of
the
wood
characteristics
on
the
front
end
a
bit
of
coffee
earthdirt
and
carmel
complex
and
busy
again
a
bit
like
a
stout
feel
is
rich
and
creamy
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
and
life
medium
to
thick
on
the
tongue
overall
an
interesting
porter
i
enjoyed
the
complex
taste
and
limited
hop
profile
the
woodearth
taste
was
a
bit
powerful
a
strong
porter
imo
and
bordering
on
a
ris
i
like
the
creativity
and
blend
of
flavors
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
and
id
hit
another
its
more
of
a
sipper
worth
a
try
whats
the
gobbledygook
on
this
peoples
porter
is
a
robust
englishstyle
brew
with
a
dark
ruby
hue
complex
chocolate
coffee
and
toffee
notes
give
way
to
an
herbal
bitterness
finishing
with
a
pleasant
hint
of
espresso
overall
a
solid
porter
with
a
full
flavor
easy
to
consume
this
one
definitely
worth
trying
this
one
peoples
porter
is
another
nice
release
from
foothills
brewing
company
they
brew
some
really
good
beer
this
one
could
be
improved
with
a
slightly
stronger
nose
and
a
bit
more
body
damn
tasty
as
it
is
though
easy
recommendation
i
wish
this
saw
mn
distro
because
it
is
so
approachable
but
complex
enough
to
satisfy
any
porter
lover
peoples
porter
pours
black
with
just
the
faintest
bit
of
ruby
red
highlights
three
fingers
of
khaki
colored
foam
rise
up
atop
the
beer
and
stick
around
for
a
minute
or
two
theres
a
bit
of
lacing
left
along
the
glass
but
not
necessarily
a
ton
the
nose
has
lots
of
caramel
and
a
smooth
chocolate
aroma
the
flavors
got
a
good
bit
of
roast
going
on
though
its
trending
more
towards
coffee
than
chocolate
here
a
healthy
dollop
of
caramel
rounds
out
the
malt
profile
theres
a
light
bitterness
and
distinct
earthyherbal
hop
finish
thats
almost
too
intense
at
times
for
a
relatively
malt
driven
the
style
the
body
is
nice
and
firm
giving
solid
support
to
the
malts
and
the
carbonation
is
just
enough
to
cut
through
the
sweetness
and
let
the
hops
have
their
say
peoples
porter
is
my
first
beer
from
foothills
and
im
really
enjoying
it
i
almost
want
to
say
its
too
hoppy
for
its
own
good
but
thats
not
quite
the
case
well
this
is
a
gorgeous
porter
with
a
great
smell
and
unfortunately
the
taste
just
doesnt
live
up
disappointing
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
light
carbonation
quiet
drinkable
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
overall
a
really
great
porter
and
one
i
would
like
to
try
again
either
bottled
or
served
on
regular
co2
o
i
definitely
will
pick
up
more
of
this
brew
a
superb
example
of
a
medium
abv
porter
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
taste
is
very
onedimensional
heavy
on
the
char
and
the
smoke
and
i
just
want
more
different
flavors
more
depth
more
something
not
my
favorite
porter
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
as
i
expected
it
to
be
a
pretty
standard
porter
perhaps
fooled
by
the
name
in
fact
its
a
very
rich
and
tasty
beer
with
some
complexity
as
well
perhaps
its
not
as
complex
as
some
of
its
counterparts
but
its
certainly
no
standard
porter
recommended
overall
an
ok
beer
it
tastes
like
a
pretty
average
porter
with
the
usual
tastes
with
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
i
wonder
if
i
didnt
get
an
old
bottle
as
the
finish
tasted
quite
stale
oh
well
this
showing
was
pretty
average
o
strange
metallic
presence
in
the
taste
really
drags
this
one
down
its
too
bad
i
had
high
hopes
from
the
aroma
its
drinkable
enough
to
finish
at
least
o
i
am
not
a
porter
fan
by
any
means
but
this
brew
is
very
good
it
makes
me
think
i
might
like
porter
very
sweet
yet
bitter
o
a
flavorful
roasty
porter
which
after
warming
at
least
has
none
of
the
flaws
found
too
often
in
porters
e
g
too
smokey
burnt
notes
more
complex
and
satisfying
than
most
porters
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
amer
english
porter

25
o
peoples
porter
is
a
quality
example
of
an
english
porter
it
went
down
quick
and
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
thanks
again
ryan
o
how
does
one
mess
up
a
porter
theres
really
no
way
to
do
it
and
im
proud
to
report
that
foothills
doesnt
do
it
either
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
its
balanced
smooth
drinkable
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
in
the
future
overall
this
was
quite
good
for
a
porter
i
highly
enjoyed
it
and
would
welcome
more
of
it
anytime
if
not
for
the
slight
tang
in
the
taste
this
would
be
the
perfect
porter
i
cannot
wait
for
the
barrelaged
version
but
i
promised
someone
i
would
share
notes
bomber
picked
up
the
day
it
was
bottled
and
had
shortly
thereafter
fair
porter
good
quality
bracket
but
in
line
with
the
overall
benchmark
impression
i
got
from
most
foothills
brews
now
id
gladly
have
it
again
when
passing
through
the
town
o
a
very
drinkable
porter
with
a
pleasant
bitter
taste
would
pair
equally
well
with
fish
and
chips
or
a
juicy
burger
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
yet
quite
tasty
porterthe
flavors
never
lost
the
interest
of
my
taste
buds
through
the
duration
of
drinking
a
25
ounce
bomber
o
a
solid
english
porter
not
outstanding
but
solid
a
very
dark
brown
colored
beer
with
a
khaki
colored
head
the
aroma
is
quite
roasty
with
a
little
bit
of
toffee
and
chocolate
there
is
a
little
bit
of
toasted
malt
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
coffee
a
little
light
in
the
flavor
department
its
sort
of
watery
there
is
a
definite
bitterness
to
it
however
still
some
roasted
malt
and
a
light
toffee
and
chocolate
sweetness
to
it
a
bit
of
a
let
down
o
an
enjoyable
english
porter
but
not
an
amazing
one
considering
this
used
to
be
a
pretty
local
place
for
me
before
i
moved
i
probably
enjoyed
it
more
times
than
i
would
if
i
had
to
work
hard
to
locate
it
overall
just
a
hint
of
too
much
bitterness
to
be
an
easy
drinker
not
a
bad
beer
but
wheres
the
depth
if
the
taste
doubleddown
on
the
nose
this
coulda
been
a
contendah
onenote
but
still
strangely
appealing
slips
away
easily
decent
enough
this
beer
is
beautiful
pours
close
to
black
with
an
off
white
head
there
is
great
retention
and
beautiful
lacing
aroma
is
outstanding
as
well
lots
of
roasty
bitter
coffee
a
bit
minerally
which
i
am
not
the
hugest
fan
of
but
very
nice
nonetheless
the
beer
is
crisp
and
roasty
with
some
coffee
a
mild
earthy
hop
character
a
little
bit
of
smoke
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
the
roast
is
verging
on
being
overdone
but
i
think
it
is
not
quite
there
yet
mouthfeel
is
thin
yet
somehow
has
a
fine
creamy
carbonation
it
does
make
it
very
drinkable
but
i
would
like
a
bit
more
body
medium
bodied
but
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
with
a
good
balance
of
roasted
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
theres
a
decent
amount
of
roasted
malt
that
gives
off
a
subtle
smoke
character
but
it
never
feels
burnt
or
overpowering
hints
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
toast
caramel
and
oatmeal
dominate
the
flavor
before
finishing
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
surprisingly
hoppy
for
the
style
with
more
dry
bitterness
than
i
prefer
this
element
takes
away
from
the
more
pleasant
malt
flavors
and
unfortunately
begins
to
dominate
things
as
i
work
my
way
through
the
bottle
rich
aroma
has
burnt
wood
unsweet
chocolate
and
quality
coffee
notes
with
undertones
of
molasses
and
licorice
got
my
mouth
watering
it
pours
an
opaque
darkchocolate
brown
with
a
thick
fluffy
and
rather
persistent
light
tan
head
delicious
flavor
lives
up
to
the
aroma
having
roast
coffee
chocolate
molasses
and
licorice
tones
plus
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
bitter
hoppy
undertone
that
actually
helps
round
out
the
flavor
rather
than
detract
from
it
texture
is
the
beers
weakest
point
body
is
on
the
thin
side
it
seems
for
a
porter
and
there
is
just
a
little
fizz
o
overall
a
nice
porter
not
my
favorite
a
bit
too
much
burnt
chocolate
for
me
but
enjoyable
robust
indeed
o
its
a
b
beer
for
me
many
others
are
above
this
for
me
not
bad
by
any
means
just
not
the
best
porter
dark
opaque
nearly
black
color
with
a
solid
head
of
tan
foam
that
soon
shrinks
to
a
creamy
cap
somewhat
sweet
dark
chocolate
and
slightly
charred
black
malt
aroma
increased
black
malt
in
the
flavor
along
with
an
added
dark
fruitiness
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
earthy
bitterness
medium
roasty
and
drying
a
little
better
on
tap
but
a
worthy
addition
to
the
foothills
bottling
line
taste
is
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
it
feels
like
olde
hickory
hickory
stick
stout
the
wood
feels
bitter
and
astringent
and
almost
out
of
place
smoothness
is
absent
and
i
miss
it
tons
this
is
a
good
local
porter
to
me
green
man
gets
the
nod
here
by
just
the
slightest
bit
i
will
have
to
give
it
a
try
in
the
bomber
once
they
hit
the
shelfs
i
rate
this
a
b
due
in
part
to
the
bitterness
and
the
lack
of
real
complexity
good
effort
from
foothills
here
nice
session
porter
here
i
would
say
that
this
is
not
my
fav
porter
but
still
very
descent
o
a
very
nice
porter
holds
it
own
and
is
pleasant
enough
to
be
quite
sessionable
color
is
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
that
is
barely
translucent
around
the
edges
and
a
big
thick
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
the
aroma
has
some
toasted
malts
and
hints
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
black
coffee
the
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
continue
through
the
flavor
with
the
overall
taste
being
somewhat
similar
to
guinness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
good
othe
beer
is
a
drinkable
porter
it
is
flavorful
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
with
enough
bitterness
to
balance
the
beer
growler
from
riverside
beverage
company
in
chattanooga
dark
black
puffy
tan
head
smells
good
roasty
malts
and
very
inviting
flavor
was
rich
hint
of
dark
chocolate
but
none
of
the
coffee
that
other
reviewers
have
noted
overall
this
was
very
tasty
and
i
was
not
sad
i
chose
this
over
the
hoppyum
this
time
i
think
i
may
need
some
sexual
chocolate
at
this
point
o
d
this
is
nice
good
coffee
flavors
a
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
that
id
be
glad
to
enjoy
again
in
the
future
d
an
extremely
drinkable
porter
beer
is
thin
light
in
body
probably
a
little
too
thin
but
it
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
dark
beer
there
is
some
lead
off
sweetness
with
a
mild
roasty
bitter
finish
mildly
hopped
overall
a
good
drinking
but
rather
boring
beer
it
was
fine
pours
a
deep
russet
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
goodness
chocolate
and
a
little
touch
of
coffee
tastes
of
tons
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
vanilla
and
some
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
d
quite
drinkable
although
for
me
a
porter
isnt
something
im
really
into
throwing
back
a
lot
of
that
being
said
this
is
really
good
stuff
and
i
was
impressed
overall
impression
good
stuff
worth
seeking
out
foothills
have
proven
their
worth
with
big
beers
and
sessionable
beers
alike
peoples
porter
is
just
another
impressive
brew
on
their
cantlose
roster
i
love
this
beer
it
is
my
favorite
offering
from

is
an

some
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
smuttynoses
robust
porter
comes
to
mind
if
you
see
this
on
tap
around
the
southeast
do
yourself
a
favor
and
imbibe
i
also
was
able
to
pick
up
a
growler
of
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
beer
and
i
will
review
that
after
i
get
a
chance
to
try
it
fairly
creamy

drinks
great
after

on

try

you
can

this
is
a
tasty
easydrinking
porter
a
very
nice
dark
beer
for
the
summer
one
of
the
highlights
of
my
trip
to
nc
exceptional
porter
exceptional
beer
overall
this
beer
incorporates
elements
of
an
american
robust
porter
without
pushing
things
too
far
off
style
or
hurting
drinkability
huge
complexity
for
a
standard
porter
and
a
perfect
example
of
why
porters
are
my
favorite
style
when
done
right
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
a
good
beer
but
it
certainly
isnt
the
best
of
the
style
this
is
a
good
fallback
beer
if
i
cant
find
anything
else
i
really
like
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
another
solid
nc
offering
overall
i
was
excited
about
trying
this
beer
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
a
very
welldone
porter
with
excellent
subtleties
well
worth
a
shot
d
this
is
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
porters
if
not
my
very
favorite
this
stuff
is
good
competition
for
great
lakes
edmund
fitzgerald
another
fine
porter
the
peoples
porter
is
easily
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
out
there
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
finishes
nicely
not
cloying
in
the
least
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
not
too
bad
at
all
a
heavyhanded
pour
results
in
a
big
thick
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
leaving
a
ton
of
lacing
all
over
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
color
is
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
that
is
barely
translucent
around
the
edges
im
a
little
stuffed
up
but
i
can
still
identify
the
toasted
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
black
coffee
the
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
continue
through
the
flavor
with
the
overall
taste
being
somewhat
similar
to
guinness
in
a
good
way
but
with
a
more
roasted
character
and
greater
depth
of
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
overall
drinkability
is
terrific
d
this
beer
is
tasty
and
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
just
stopped
in
for
a
growler
fill
from
the
source
on
the
way
down
to
myrtle
beach
not
overly
impressed
quality
across
the
board
was
lacking
one
beer
like
sexual
chocolate
shouldnt
really
make
you
a
ba
destination
the
beers
were
acceptable
just
not
stellar
i
would
like
to
try
the
sc
imperial

if
the
chance
comes
my
way
this
one
appears
pitch

and
a

alot
of
black
patent
malt
more
dark
cocoa
and
roastiness
than
sweet
and
creamy
flavor
does
have
a
mild
lactic
twang
to
it
but
more
robust
roasts
come
to
play
with
herbal

background
peeking
through
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
finishs
dry
with
those
herbal
hops
and
dark
roasts
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
fuller
bodied
and
carbonation
was
on
overall
i
cant
say
anything
bad
about
this
brew
i
thought
it
was
the
best
of
their
lineups
smaller
beers
and
my
wife
loved
it
i
had
a
glass
and
a
half
the
rest
my
wife
took
care
of
on
vacation
reviewed
on

i
had
this
on
draft
this
beer
pours
brown
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
of
bitter
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
robust
palate
and
quite
delicious
this
was
a
surprisingly
topnotch
porter
i
received
a
growler
of
this
from
loki
in
the
growling
at

thank
you
poured
into
my

appears
a
rather
dark

still
translucent
rich

color
with
about
a
finger
of
creamy
ecru
foam
a
thin
sporadic
lace
is
left
by
the

as
my
glass
slowly
empties
nose
consists
of
medium
roasted

sweet

chocolate
cocoa
and
earthy

very

brings
chocolate
egg
cream
sodas
to
mind
as
well
as
toasted
and
caramelized
malts
and
grains
mild
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
a
few
notches
better
than
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
for
the
style
a
highly
drinkable
porter
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
most
definitely
a
porter
for
the
people
on
tap
at
the
saucer
and
served
in
a
english
pint
glass
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
head
there
was
minimal
lacing
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
dominate
the
aroma
the
taste
has
bitter
chocolate
coffee
and
toffee
it
is
a
little
then
but
not
so
much
that
it
is
distracting
a
nice
sessionable
porter
da
solid
go
to
good
to
have
in
the
regular
line
up
porter
all
the
highlights
i
like
with
hints
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
coffee
nice
and
smooth
with
plenty
of
flavour
without
going
over
the
top
pors
out
a
dark
brown
not
quite
black
color
with
ruby
highlights
the
head
is
loose
and
tan
colored
and
it
sort
of
fades
fast
leaving
a
little
lacing
the
smell
at
first
is
of
crisp
carbonation
with
a
whiff
of
powdery
sweet
malts
with
a
tiny
hint
of
roasted
barleycoffee
in
the
background
about
normal
but
not
as
deep
as
id
like
the
taste
is
nice
a
little
raw
but
nice
theres
a
dry
caramelly
maltiness
backed
with
big
roast
barleycoffee
notes
i
can
also
sense
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
flavor
in
here
which
is
interesting
theres
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
flavor
but
its
dry
enough
that
its
hard
to
notice
there
isnt
as
much
depth
as
id
like
but
i
think
its
the
dryness
a
quality
ive
noticed
as
common
in
foothills
dark
beers
just
needs
a
bit
more
in
residual
sugars
theres
just
enough
sweetness
that
it
doesnt
ruin
the
whole
thing
but
there
isnt
enough
sweetness
to
really
make
it
great
its
like
a
battle
that
neither
side
is
winning
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
prickly
but
this
one
is
about
as
full
as
id
expect
but
your
mouth
feels
well
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
its
really
easy
to
drink
though
and
not
too
high
in
abv
the
drink
is
enjoyable
but
not
stellar
m
thin
bodied
decent
carbonation
the
drink
is
on
the
heavy
end
of
the
mediumbodied
spectrum
and
is
one
silkysmooth
quaffer
rich
creamy
and
delicious
drinkability
what
an
unexpected
and
pleasant
surprise
in
the
most
unlikely
of
places
this
is
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
and
manages
to
hit
just
about
all
the
right
notes
the
alcohols
low
and
nowhere
to
be
found
to
boot
just
a
really
good
allaround
enjoyable
porter
recommended
if
you
see
it
on
tap
this
porter
is
extremely
drinkable
an
outstanding
beer
from
foothills
great
crisp
mouthfeel
that
felt
nice
and
slightly
tingly
in
the
mouth
wonderful
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
nuts
coffee
and
some
dark
fruits
wash
over
the
palate
my
wife
doesnt
really
like
darker
beers
but
loved
this
one
great
warming
brew
to
enjoy
a
colder
evening
with
delicious
recommend

to
have
this
on

an
awesome
porter
from
fotthills
good
job
jsmie
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
to
match
overall
i
again
thought
this
one
was
excellent
there
was
really
nothing
i
could
fine
wrong
with
it
and
it
is
remarkable
that
beers
this
good
are
coming
out
of
nc
and
nobody
knows
about
them
if
you
really
want
to
try
and
excellent
porter
get
one
of
us
to
send
a
growler
of
this
your
way
trust
me
you
will
not
be
disappointed
excellent
flavor
for
an
english
porter
stlye
roasted
malts
toffee
rye
biscuity
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
grounds
came
together
with
a
pinch
of
hops
to
make
an
excellent
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
wasnt
overly
special
but
still
quite
good
creamy
medium
body
nice
carbonation
and
a
solid
bitter
finish
for

this
is
one
hell
of
a
porter
ill
definately
be
filling
up
a
growler
of
this
next
time
im
through
winstonsalem
all
in
all
though
this
was
a
very
well
crafted
tasty
and
hugely
quaffable
porter
from
foothills
i
just
missed
this
on
our
last
visit
back
in
november
so
it
was
a
pleasure
to
finally
be
able
to
try
it
way
too
drinkable
i
was
at
a
bar
with
40
taps
and
could
spend
the
whole
night
drinking
just
this
excellent
porter
excellent
beer
go
to
your
local
tap
room
and
order
a
pint
go
to
the
brewery
and
get
you
a
growler
or
trade
for
a
growler
frankly
this
is
another
hit
from
foothills
a
company
with
which
im
rapidly
becoming
enamored
this
is
a
classic
pub
porter
well
done
prosit
had
this
one
on
draft
at
the
brewpub
in
winston
salem
on
some
levels
it
is
not
much
different
from
most
average
porters
i
am
however
much
more
accustomed
to
american
style
porters
the
flavor
was
definitely
on
the
robust
side
with
subtle
coffee
and
cocoa
coming
through
in
the
aftertaste
very
warming
on
a
cold
rainy
winter
night
for
a
beer
of
normal
alcohol
strength
i
hope
to
see
this
at
the
raleigh
flying
saucer
so
i
can
have
it
again
this
winter
i
really
liked
this
one
a
little
too
drinkable
to
me
a
bit
thin
in
the
flavor
arena
my
new
world
bias
and
san
diego
upbringing
clouding
my
judgement
everything
i
look
for
in
a
porter
just
more
subtle
and
lighter
i
do
not
dispute
the
high
marks
given
by
others
as
this
is
the
benchmark
brew
but
for
those
with
my
disposition
a
fair
warning
about
subtlety
not
bad
not
good
just
right
in
the
middle
the
flavor
profile
is
good
with
reasonable
intensity
complexity
and
balance
it
begins
with
a
blended
flavor
that
is
tart
and
separates
into
light
notes
of
roast
and
coffee
and
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
middle
introduces
a
slight
sweetness
underneath
as
the
sweetness
fades
dark
fruit
is
present
o
2
75
i
feel
bad
the
beer
is
a
year
old
i
really
like
stuff
from
samuel
smith
and
i
think
this
didnt
get
a
fair
shake
that
being
said
it
is
what
it
is
got
another
one
the
next
night
so
i
was
hoping
to
be
impressed
however
i
just
cant
bring
myself
to
really
enjoy
a
porter
this
beer
is
really
good
warming
satisfying
and
a
wonderful
flavour
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
but
may
be
adjusting
to
the
difference
between
english
porter
and
american
porter
didnt
detect
much
flavor
or
complexity
in
the
taste
and
left
not
much
of
a
mouthfeel
o
its
a
little
pricey
for
a
4
pack
in
my
area
in
hawaii
but
i
feel
lucky
to
try
a
world
class
beer
such
as
this
one
not
my
favorite
but
if
i
ever
feel
like
it
ill
get
another
pack
of
this
beer
cant
wait
to
try
there
other
types
that
they
make
not
one
of
my
favorite
porters
was
expecting
more
really
but
i
think
its
just
my
preference
in
porter
styles
long
subtle
finish
of
coffee
hints
of
toffee
poured

super
smooth

taste
up

with
a
nice

carbonated

fig
on
the

end
super
solid

i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
another
middle
of
the
road
transition
beer
incredible

just
not
enough
praise
extremely
dark

almost
black

allowing
any

some
light
coffee
dark

and
sweet

taste
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
with
flavors
of
raisins
dates

and
a
touch
of

in
the
finish
overall
feels
good
on
the
palate

course
its
only
5
00
abv
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
a
little
more
bold
and
bitter
but
overall
a
great
sessionable
porter
with
a
decent
balance
perfection
perfection

its
pretty
much
a
slightly
better
version
of
the
standard
newcastle
brown
ale

very
smooth

left
something
to
be
desired

one
of
my
favourites
prost
a
really
straight
forward
perfect
porter
give
it
a
try
overall
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
porter
but
it
is
definetly
worth
the
purchase
i
will
buy
it
again
and
depending
on
how
my
spaghetti
sauce
turns
out
it
may
have
become
my
go
to
beer
for
cooking
chili
stews
and
sauces
wow
really
loved
this
one
a
lot
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
colored
head
that
doesnt
trail
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
decadent
with
hints
of
chocolate
sweet
cream
and
walnuts
the
taste
was
just
as
tasty
with
chocolate
and
coffee
being
front
and
center
and
a
little
bit
of
smoke
which
evened
everything
out
was
very
impressed
and
will
definitely
try
again
this
is
a
perplexing
beer
for
me
a
difficult
one
to
rate
for
sure
i
want
to
smell
this
beer
all
day
long
but
then
i
get
to
the
diacetyl
and
im
not
sure
if
i
want
another
sip
or
not
maybe
i
got
a
bad
4pack
but
im
not
positive
i
cant
decide
if
i
want
to
drink
the
other
two
bottles
i
have
left
or
cook
with
them
lower
abv
than
most
modern
american
porters
but
with
more
complexity
great
beer
550ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
colour
with
a
creamy
tan
head
which
lasted
well
and
left
lace
plimsoll
lines
on
drinking
roasted
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
initial
mild
sweetness
develops
into
a
moderate
roasted
character
and
then
into
a
lingering
medium
bitterness
medium
body
and
creamy
texture
very
easy
drinking
one
for
those
that
appreciate
dark
chocolate
o
what
a
fantastic
brew
big
flavor
big
body
perfectly
dry
while
still
offering
some
typically
sweet
flavor
and
a
sessionable
abv
i
feel
like
i
took
a
step
back
into
history
fantastic
flavor
and
very
well
balanced
overall
very
easy
drinking
and
tastes
great
cant
believe
i
havent
had
this
classic
before
now
or
at
least
havent
reviewed
it
550

am
trying

rich

is
similarly
earthy
and
vaguely
sour
like
cacao
mixed
with
fruity
molasses
caramel
develops
on
both
nose
and
palate
over
the
course
of
a
few
sips
little
in
the
way
of
caustic
or
rough
bitterness
despite
the
earthiness
which
im
thinking
is
hopderived
in
part
some
colalike
brown
spice
smooth
creamy
mouth
feel
and
moderate
to
thick
bodied
with
more
of
that
odd
chalky
sourness
in
the
semidry
finish
lingering
caramel
and
raisin
sweetness
diacetyl
from
those
those
open
square
fermenters
some
of
the
written
descriptions
of
this
beer
ive
encountered
may
overstate
this
brews
smoky
sour
character
but
certainly
this
feature
is
present
i
also
get
considerable
sweetness
of
both
dark
and
fruity
varieties
classic
brew
indeed
and
somehow
light
and
mellow
enough
to
enjoy
in
reasonable
quantity
o
im
a
fan
this
doesnt
strike
me
quite
as
complex
and
tasty
as
an
edmund
fitzgerald
but
it
is
a
solid
porter
and
enjoyable
i
think
thats
due
to
the
heavy
focus
on
the
earthen
flavors
which
threaten
to
overpower
the
malt
at
times
a
classic
porter
with
an
understated
complexity
it
reminds
me
of
fall
which
is
why
i
am
drinking
it
and
any
beer
that
has
a
unique
enough
taste
ti
invoke
good
memories
is
a
good
one
it
is
earthy
mildly
bitter
slightly
sweet
with
a
good
finish
i
love
it
perfect
for
autumn
evenings
when
the
leaves
are
flying
and
the
temps
begin
to
dip
o
a
fine
porter
id
gladly
revisit
o
this
one
is
a
touch
less
smooth
than
samuel
smiths
excellent
oatmeal
stout
its
still
very
smooth
though
its
not
overly
roasty
like
some
porters
and
stouts
the
sweetness
doesnt
get
out
of
hand
either
this
is
an
incredibly
well
balanced
porter
pours
a
near
black
in
color
with
just
a
bit
of
small
tan
head
average
carbonation
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
when
sipped
smells
of
coffee
with
some
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
raisins
or
dark
fruit
overall
taste
is
the
same
with
a
light
bitter
finish
that
wasnt
bad
at
all
actually
a
great
porter
probably
the
blueprint
for
most
american
porters
that
followed
it
classic
if
not
earth
shattering
o
wow
for
the
style
this
is
amazing
top
notch
a
pretty
darn
good
porter
easy
to
drink
not
cloying
lovely
good
to
try
a
porter
that
is
true
to
style
rather
than
americanized
will
be
buying
more
o
everything
that
was
said
about
this
beer
was
right
worth
the
wait
and
satisfying
till
the
last
sip
try
it
quite
an
impressive
porter
complex
with
great
flavour
and
nose
its
a
bit
thin
for
my
personal
taste
but
that
wont
stop
me
from
hopefully
having
it
again
overall
an
outstanding
porter
very
drinkable
but
very
satisfying
and
interesting
will
buy
again
fore
sure
overall
after
having
their
imperial
stout
i
had
high
expectations
and
they
were
met
for
the
most
part
maybe
a
little
lighter
than
i
prefer
but
hey
im
an
american
spoiled
on
american
beers
the
flavors
and
aromas
were
balanced
quite
nicely
however
and
as
my
pallet
has
progressed
ive
come
to
appreciate
balance
more
not
to
offend
anyone
but
the
dark
fruit
notes
soley
remind
me
of
yuengling
porter
but
turned
up
a
few
notches
the
unsweetened
bakers
chocolate
balances
those
notes
well
this
makes
me
want
to
give
fullers
another
try
as
i
wasnt
quite
fond
of
it
a
while
back
maybe
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
english
beers
after
all
only
time
will
tell
for
the
meantime
this
was
another
enjoyable
offering
from
what
is
so
far
my
favorite
english
brewery
cheers
o
complex
and
delicious
this
is
what
i
would
call
a
true
porter
its
sweet
and
nutty
and
has
plenty
of
creaminess
to
fill
you
up
im
squinting
a
bit
as
i
strain
to
pick
out
the
flavors
in
the
mouth
its
admittedly
a
struggle
but
theres
real
complexity
im
thinking
several
fruits
with
blueberry
among
them
rye
bread
sort
of
greasy
like
pizza
crust
mildly
roasty
malt
a
yeasty
tartness
and
a
hint
of
diacetyl
dairy
o
the
prototypical
english
porter
nothing
mind
blowing
but
always
a
treat
o
what
a
fantastic
session
porter
goes
down
smooth
with
the
classic
coffee
and
roasted
malt
porter
flavours
the
roasted
flavours
are
kept
in
check
and
the
slightly
higher
than
normal
carbonation
makes
this
beer
more
refreshing
than
anticipated
i
wish
i
could
get
this
on
tap
a
very
good
reason
to
visit
yorkshire
i
think
might
be
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
sam
smith
so
far
a
porter
to
remember
enjoy
final
grade
4
00
just
eking
out
an
a
ive
been
searching
a
long
time
for
a
bottle
of
the
famous
taddy
porter
and
finally
my
persistence
has
been
rewarded
this
is
a
remarkably
wellmade
beer
and
although
it
lacks
the
unusual
flavours
or
intensity
of
many
american
porter
interpretations
theres
always
going
to
be
room
for
the
classics
in
my
fridge
i
still
like
fullers
lp
more
but
this
is
a
good
replacement
that
no
stoutporter
fan
should
neglect
to
try
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
point
glass
it
has
a
black
appearance
with
low
to
no
transparency
and
a
small
tan
head
it
has
a
hoppy
and
roasted
malt
smell
it
has
a
very
roasted
taste
with
a
medium
maltiness
it
has
a
creamy
mouth
feel
with
a
wet
finish
overall
its
a
nice
porter
with
a
good
roasted
character
overall
awesome
porter
very
drinkable
5
not
as
bitter
or
roasted
as
some
american
porters
but
the
balance
is
great
world
class
english
porter
o
a
very
common
offering
that
never
disappoints
o
a
superb
porter
that
deserves
the
title
of
famous
always
a
winner
o
this
is
a
very
decent
english
porter
this
would
really
go
well
with
the
shepards
pie
that
my
wife
loves
to
make
a
very
dark
full
bodied
ale
with
a
rich
creamy
head
and
an
intense
dry
tangy
character
brewed
with
well
water
the
original
well
sunk
in
1758
is
still
in
use
malted
barley
roasted
malt
yeast
and
hops
fermented
in
stone
yorkshire
squares
the
type
of
beer
first
brewed
in
the
early
18th
century
gained
its
name
from
being
drunk
by
porters
in
the
fish
meat
and
other
produce
markets
o
delicious
though
it
has
been
years
since
i
last
had
this
perhaps
a
bit
overrated
but
definitely
recommended
o
if
there
is
a
better
english
porter
i
want
to
drink
it
home
tasting
550ml
bottle
into
snifter
glass
12714
yeah
for
me
this
is
pretty
much
the
gold
standard
for
porters
im
sure
theres
plenty
out
there
i
havent
tried
but
until
then
im
sticking
with
this
cheers
prost
lampertland
overall
a
delicious
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
this
seems
like
a
fine
example
of
an
english
porter
though
my
experience
is
rather
limited
its
definitely
a
good
beer
to
celebrate
a
festive
occasion
with
355
ml
bottle
pours
a
black
colour
with
a
big
head
and
theres
always
a
ring
and
lace
smell
of
chocolate
coffee
caramel
liquorice
and
some
burnt
wood
creamy
palate
so
not
full
taste
is
the
same
as
smell
burnt
notes
more
accentuated
but
all
is
there
chocolate
coffee
caramel
and
liquorice
bitterswwet
finish
an
absolutely
great
beer
classic
example
of
an
english
porter
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
or
on
cask
someday
put
it
on
the
bucket
list
o
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
would
absolutely
buy
again
if
it
had
a
thicker
body
and
few
extra
abv
points
it
would
be
a
world
class
brew
expertly
crafted
from
pure
ingredients
using
a
unique
fermentation
style
gives
this
ale
a
special
character
that
while
subtle
is
not
found
in
other
examples
of
the
style
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
someday
rated
to
style
it
would
be
difficult
to
surpass
though
i
might
prefer
meantimes
london
porter
over
all
nice
porter
flavorful
but
not
heavy
very
flexible
it
could
be
a
session
beer
or
for
slow
drinking
the
taste
of
this
beer
has
convinced
me
that
samuel
smiths
taddy
porter
is
a
masterful
rendition
of
the
style
the
metallic
nose
leads
me
to
suspect
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
bottle
ill
pick
up
another
soon
and
rereview
a
really
good
beer
might
be
a
wee
bit
heavy
for
most
new
to
the
style
overall
quite
a
tasty
porter
worth
picking
up
but
at
the
price
i
would
stick
to
local
offerings
for
some
personal
context
i
like
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
better
its
a
crossstyle
comparison
but
the
oatmeal
stout
is
a
bit
more
like
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taddy
porter
here
is
darker
a
bit
more
burnt
both
are
fantastic
o
a
very
nice
classic
porter
great
look
and
feel
taste
is
pretty
much
the
blueprint
for
the
style
enjoyable
tasty
and
drinkable
this
is
probably
my
favorite
porter
that
i
have
ever
tried
i
drank
it
a
lot
when
i
lived
in
england
and
still
enjoy
it
from
time
to
time
in
the
u
s
pretty
affordable
and
widely
available
where
i
live
perhaps
the
standard
bearer
for
this
style
overall
a
very
nice
porter
hops
are
present
in
a
light
style
balanced
in
mouth
even
with
a
strong
presence
of
liquorices
and
caramel
a
smooth
drinking
beer
another
example
of
sam
smiths
well
crafted
beers
o
while
its
decent
enough
i
cant
help
but
be
a
little
let
down
i
love
the
imperial
stout
from
these
guys
but
this
is
only
slightly
above
average
maybe
another
porter
i
had
earlier
today
anchors
porter
gave
me
unrealistic
expectations
i
wouldnt
ever
refuse
it
at
least
but
well
worth
the
search
porter
the
next
best
thing
to
a
stout
unless
you
grab
a
taddy
porter
this
is
by
far
the
best
porter
i
have
had
to
date
and
can
stand
up
to
most
stouts
and
porters
alike
the
color
is
a
dark
rich
brown
almost
black
the
smell
is
great
of
coffee
and
malt
and
the
taste
is
balanced
with
coffee
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
truly
a
pleasure
to
drink
samuel
smiths
hits
a
home
run
with
this
one
must
try
overall
pretty
solid
porter
such
a
classic
a
worldclass
beer
one
of
my
favorite
porter
delicious
pours
a
black

12
inch

of
an
offtan

great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
oatmeal
sweet
malt
hint
of
hop
hint
of
syrup
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
english
porter
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
hop
hint
of

and

of

overall
very
sweet

good
blend
in
the
body
and
decent
feel
good
roast
malt
character
with
enough
chocolate
for
the
style
fairly
complex
with
the
sherry
and
dark
fruit
notes
its
a
little
bitter
at
the
finish
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
gorgeous
halffinger
tan
head
very
nice
looking
beer
very
true
to
style
scents
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
a
heavy
roasted
malt
presence
excellent
the
taste
is
a
classic
porter
roast

dark
chocolate
in
the
background
a
bit
of
black
coffee
some
slight
nuttiness
and
a
dry
finish
with
a
slight
bit
of
tang
throughout
perfectly
executed
mouthfeel
is
true
to
form
with
a
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
porter
one
of
the
best
ive
come
across
and
well
worth
drinking
a
great
classic
example
of
a
porter
one
that
will
always
be
tasty
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
brown
in
color
a
light
chocolate
aroma
taste
begins
with
a
bit
of
acidic
twang
followed
by
some
coffee
then
finishing
with
some
stone
fruit
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
light
overall
quite
a
good
porter
that
i
would
get
again
the
taste
is
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
suggests
with
a
nice
chocolate
thing
up
front
and
a
mellow
but
well
balanced
dry
hopped
finish
it
feels
more
like
an
irish
dry
stout
at
points
but
this
is
the
porter
that
many
try
to
emulate
overall
another
great
beer
from
sam
smiths
havent
been
disappointed
yet
o
for
me
this
is
good
but
not
great
i
know
its
one
of
the
standards
of
the
style
but
it
just
doesnt
blow
me
away
that
being
said
its
a
must
try
as
it
really
is
a
classic
beer
from
a
classic
brewery
overall
impression
a
nice
english
porter
that
brings
great
roasty
flavor
sweet
malty
finish
but
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
swig
very
dark
black
cherry
look
clear
with
a
small
fluffy
head
with
minimal
head
lacing
and
retention
smell
is
airy
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
engish
hops
taste
is
light
roasted
malt
malted
barley
cocoa
powder
earthy
hops
medium
bodied
and
slightly
sour
at
the
very
end
of
the
finish
i
expected
more
power
on
the
palate
based
on
what
i
picked
up
on
the
nose
overall
i
would
appreciate
a
more
robust
nose
and
flavor
profile
but
the
integration
and
balance
is
almost
unmatched

by

one
of
the
best
all
around
and
most
true
to
form
porters
i
have
ever
had
there
is
really
nothing
to
dislike
about
this
brew
pours
a
very
dark
red
with
khaki
head
with
some
retention
fairly
mild
nose
but
plenty
of
chocolate
raisin
smoke
coffee
and
molasses
taste
follows
suit
with
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
bitter
chocolate
hops
and
roasted
notes
not
heavy
and
overbearing
like
a
lot
of
stouts
and
porters
but
very
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
overall
terrific
beer
my
new
baseline
for
what
a
porter
should
be
i
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
i
was
not
disappointed
great
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
i
expected
a
good
beer
when
i
picked
it
up
and
i
may
have
gotten
a
great
one
the
price
is
right
on
this
one
at
just
over
3
and
theyre
really
easy
to
find
i
think
ill
be
buying
more
soon
overall
what
a
beer
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
this
is
what
all
other
porters
hope
to
taste
like
when
they
grow
up
o
excellent
porter
malt
heavy
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
o
its
really
a
classic
porter
lovers
need
to
have
this
at
least
once
m
coats
the
mouth
from
roasted
grains
a
beer
a
beer
my
kingdom
for
a
beer
now
if
only
i
could
afford
to
buy
this
taddy
porter
in
kegs
in
conclusion
this
is
a
perfectly
blended
porter
one
that
is
generous
in
both
the
iconic
beauty
of
beer
flavors
while
yet
never
being
overbalanced
in
harmonious
perfection
clearly
the
legacy
of
samuel
smith
continues
till
this
day
and
in
my
opinion
stands
out
as
a
uniquely
proud
king
of
beers
without
equal
osuch
a
solid
beer
could
drink
this
every
day
taddy
porter
is
nearly
opaque
and
the
darkest
oily
brown
color
a
layer
of
tan
sits
on
top
and
clings
beautifully
to
the
glass
as
well
the
most
incredible
smells
fill
my
nostrils
as
a
breathe
in
the
intoxicating
aroma
toffee
molasses
caramel
chocolate
roasted
coffee
bean
hazelnut
and
light
biscuit
notes
are
present
the
nose
on
this
literally
resembles
a
fine
dessert
for
the
flavor
that
toffee
aspect
dominates
but
yet
again
with
samuel
smiths
we
get
a
fantastic
level
of
complexity
for
a
low
abv
beer
i
can
pick
up
some
bittersweet
hops
dark
fruits
and
smokiness
along
with
the
flavors
previously
detected
in
the
aroma
the
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
pleasant
another
timeless
classic
the
perfect
porter
really
loved
this
beer
i
need
to
taste
more
porters
for
comparison
but
it
was
very
complex
and
well
balanced
maybe
poured
it
too
cold
but
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
opened
up
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
its
acclaimed
for
a
reason
nice
and
complex
layered
with
roast
and
darkness
while
rounding
out
with
touches
of
floral
bitters
delicious
and
satisfying
and
generally
easy
enough
to
locate
an
amazing
beer
every
time
keep
em
comin
o
an
outstanding
english
porter
sam
smiths
doesnt
disappoint
this
beer
is
fairly
easy
to
find
which
is
a
plus
because
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
drink
this
proper
english
beer
out
of
a
proper
english
pint
glass
and
enjoy
this
beer
is
divine
an
english
porter
cannot
get
any
better
than
this
it
pours
a
luxuriously
textured
dark
brown
color
with
very
little
light
coming
in
the
head
is
about
two
inches
tall
and
super
creamy
light
mocha
in
color
the
nose
is
fantastically
enticing
with
a
lot
of
milk
chocolate
notes
from
the
malt
a
bitterness
from
the
roasted
barley
and
a
hint
of
tartness
to
it
as
well
from
the
hopping
the
flavor
is
packed
full
with
roasted
malts
and
is
heavy
on
both
the
sweet
and
bitter
chocolate
components
this
is
even
better
than
their
acclaimed
oatmeal
stout
something
about
those
stone
fermenters
really
lets
the
yeast
shine
in
all
of
their
beers
and
its
an
excellent
complement
to
the
dark
bittersweet
complexion
of
this
porter
very
little
sweetness
in
the
finish
though
as
the
hops
and
burnt
grains
bitter
it
right
up
full
bodied
and
smooth
as
anything
i
love
the
feel
of
this
beer
too
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
sold
in
four
packs
instead
of
six
packs
i
always
seem
to
be
wanting
another
one
or
two
at
the
end
of
a
session
wow
this
is
just
a
splendid
porter
an
example
to
be
followed
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
tallahassee
fl
overall
a
great
beer
with
a
deep
roasted
complexity
o
delicious
drinkable
and
full
of
flavor
simple
no
frills
just
good
overall
a
great
tasting
porter
the
flavors
are
well
blended
and
not
too
aggressive
one
of
the
best
porters
that
i
have
tried
samuel
smiths
the
famous
taddy
porter

o
terrific
porter
one
of
my
favorites
quntisential
for
the
style
the
super
dark
appearance
with
a
light
brown
retained
neck
is
absolutely
gorgeous
makes
me
feel
like
i
am
in
england
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
tones
of
coffee
and
toast
and
the
taste
also
brings
a
background
breadlike
character
the
medium
sly
body
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
hopness
at
the
end
a
sensation
of
expresso
and
slight
hopness
among
the
teeth
is
very
pleasing
just
like
the
whole
experience
with
this

this

oddly
also
slightly
sour
flavor
o
an
excellent
beer
wowza
cheerio
o
a
good
porter
that
is
worthwhile
wasnt
blown
away
as
i
thought
i
would
be
but
i
found
a
decent
porter
that
is
well
priced
try
it
if
you
could
get
it
for
cheap
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
from
start
to
finished
it
was
wellbalanced
and
rounded
from
the
subtle
sweetness
to
the
full
malt
body
to
the
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
it
left
on
my
tongue
light
and
very
drinkable
for
me
o
awesome
beer
for
what
it
is
im
used
to
more
robust
aggressively
flavored
porters
with
a
little
more
abv
but
thats
not
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
and
thats
fine
its
good
at
what
it
does
pitch
black
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
small
ring
smoky
aroma
like
a
camp
fire
gone
cold
full
bodied
heavier
than
most
porters
burnt
malt
strong
coffee
not
very
complex
but
distinctive
this
is
probably
as
close
to
a
stout
as
you
can
get
and
still
be
considered
a
porter
excellent
o
a
really
nice
easy
drinking
beer
world
class
english
porter
for
a
reason
o
famous
is
in
the
name
for
a
reason
this
is
a
great
english
porter
with
nice
complexity
that
unwinds
slowly
great
drinkability
and
price
point
especially
coming
from
across
the
pond
highly
recommended
overall
a
rather
interesting
take
on
a
porter
while
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
tanginess
that
comes
into
the
taste
toward
the
middleend
it
is
somewhat
intriguing
other
then
the
tanginess
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
feel
and
look
of
the
brew
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
great
beer
definitely
earns
that
famous
designation
on
the
label
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
porters
ever
overall
maybe
the
king
of
porters
dont
think
i
have
had
a
better
one
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
tried
in
some
time
there
is
a
great
mix
of
fruits
and
chocolate
and
the
body
is
great
with
very
creamy
feel
it
went
down
wonderfully
and
left
me
wanting
more
after
every
sip
o
a
pretty
solid
porter
no
doubt
and
for
the
price
at
my
local
grocer
its
hard
to
beat
overall
this
beer
is
a
treat
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
again
and
feel
it
was
an
amazing
value
as
well
overall
an
excellent
porter
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
exceptional
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
this
a
must
try
an
excellent
porter
with
soulsoothing
character
a
smooth
rich
chocolatey
mouth
treat
o
didnt
realize
that
an
english
porter
could
have
that
slightly
soured
character
to
it
till
i
read
the
style
description
and
the
label
this
beer
definitely
had
it
very
smooth
dark
malts
made
this
beer
complex
enough
in
the
nose
and
definitely
in
flavor
solid
body
with
a
good
balanced
feel
overall
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
nicely
balanced
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
just
the
right
proportion
of
malt
and
aging
overall
4
5
certainly
one
of
the
top
if
not
the
best
porter
i
have
ever
enjoyed
i
cannot
stress
enough
the
creaminess
and
the
butteriness
of
this
beer
i
imagine
it
would
go
good
with
food
but
should
be
imho
consumed
on
its
own
so
that
the
taster
can
hit
all
the
flavor
profiles
present
in
this
amazing
brew
recommended
this
beer
was
incredibly
hyped
up
to
me
before
i
finally
tried
it
did
it
live
up
to
the
hype
its
hard
to
say
probably
not
nevertheless
is
it
a
good
beer
absolutely
one
of
the
most
complex
flavor
profiles
for
a
porter
ive
had
that
still
manages
to
keep
your
attention
without
going
too
far
outofbounds
at
5
abv
this
is
something
you
could
drink
all
night
solid
porter
o
classic
porter
from
a
classic
brewery
surprised
by
how
smooth
and
easy
it
drinks
for
a
porter
feels
almost
like
a
milk
stout
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
at
5
abv
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
tall
creamy
brown
head
the
head
actually
hangs
around
for
a
while
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
filled
with
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
i
picked
up
a
hint
of
toffee
in
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
absolutely
follows
the
nose
the
dark
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
toffee
flavors
blend
well
and
coat
the
mouth
i
have
to
say
i
catch
some
coffee
notes
as
well
its
not
too
sweet
so
its
just
right
to
make
this
balanced
the
body
is
medium
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
most
excellent
beer
the
obvious
brewing
skill
and
small
touches
show
why
this
beer
like
most
from
samuel
smiths
is
a
classic
however
with
the
speed
of
innovation
in
the
porter
style
and
in
craft
beer
in
general
this
beer
may
be
relegated
to
more
infrequent
consumption
when
i
have
this
though
it
is
very
drinkable
and
disappears
quickly
o
a
very
good
porter
the
malts
could
be
a
bit
more
assertive
against
the
esters
but
tasty
nonetheless
i
had
saved
this
beer
in
my
fridge
for
a
relatively
special
occasion
and
decided
to
go
for
it
tonight
after
finishing
some
code
nerdy
i
know
although
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
it
failed
to
meet
my
admittedly
high
expectations
based
on
the
nut
brown
the
flavor
was
good
just
not
irresistible
like
the
brown
i
might
pick
this
up
again
now
and
then
but
there
are
plenty
of
american
porters
that
i
like
better
than
this
and
can
be
had
for
less
dverall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
an
english
porter
but
a
but
watery
overall
and
could
use
a
bump
in
the
body
to
be
great
not
to
the
level
of
fullers
london
porter
but
a
solid
sessionable
porter
for
those
winter
months
o
one
of
the
porters
i
summon
when
i
feel
the
occasion
calls
there
are
notes
that
are
not
found
elsewhere
although
the
faults
are
worth
taking
note
not
perfect
yet
represents
the
fine
craftsmanship
of
the
brewery
overall
i
could
drink
this
very
frequently
dang
near
perfect
o
a
venerable
beer
should
be
on
everyones
try
list
im
not
a
real
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
classy
beer
o
easily
the
best
porter
i
have
drank
thus
far
and
one
of
the
best
beers
samuel
smith
has
yet
to
disappoint
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
any
beer
enthusiast
and
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
these
in
the
future
final
thoughts
samuel
smiths
is
probably
my
favourite
english
brewery
and
im
sure
a
lot
of
people
say
that
the
best
part
is
that
this
is
a
beer
for
all
seasons
as
i
could
even
happily
drink
this
in
the
summer
heat
which
is
something
that
many
porters
simply
cant
say
this
is
just
another
exceptional
brew
from
another
exceptional
brewery
and
famous
for
a
reason
o
this
is
the
english
porter
against
which
all
others
must
be
measured
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
had
to
date
a
new
flavor
presents
itself
with
each
sip
it
really
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
o
very
good
a
slightly
hoppy
dark
porter
well
done
but
might
benefit
from
more
sweetness
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
slight
cocoa
and
coffee
and
some
dark
fruit
and
port
wine
aromas
taste
is
mildly
tart
and
is
of
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
carameltoffee
and
some
slight
dark
fruit
flavors
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
enjoy
the
smell
more
than
the
taste
overall
easily
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
its
not
the
most
complex
or
intense
but
its
highly
drinkable
with
a
ton
of
flavor
so
creamy
probably
the
pinnacle
for
the
style
i
prefer
a
bit
more
sweetness
like
in
american
porters
but
this
is
as
good
as
an
english
porter
gets
id
like
more
alcohol
but
this
is
close
to
perfection
o
nice
balance
and
flavor
integration
o
very
impressed
with
this
beer
a
very
well
balanced
porter
that
is
smooth
and
goes
down
well
slightly
lacks
in
body
to
be
right
up
there
with
the
best
but
great
nonetheless
opaque
in
color
with
a
nice
mahogany
colored
head
that
last
until
the
glass
is
empty
and
leaves
sticky
lace
draped
on
the
sides
smells
like
bakers
chocolate
with
vanilla
very
dry
and
roasted
in
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
nuts
and
vanilla
bitter
acidic
taste
in
the
middle
again
reminds
me
of
bakers
chocolate
the
flavors
are
subtle
but
blend
real
well
for
perfect
balance
the
dry
finish
and
mouthfeel
is
what
makes
this
beer
stand
out
above
other
outstanding
porters
excellent
session
porter
and
i
dont
really
see
how
you
could
do
better
samuel
smith
beers
are
consistently
excellent
or
so
i
thought
this
is
not
as
good
as
i
remember
its
a
good
english
porter
but
its
really
not
remarkable
in
any
way
i
would
probably
have
rated
this
higher
if
my
expectations
were
lower
overall
a
very
nice
and
well
put
together
porter
the
only
thing
i
think
would
improve
it
is
a
bit
more
body
the
price
is
pretty
high
but
so
is
the
quality
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
quite
of
bit
of
chocolate
and
brown
malt
as
well
as
a
hint
of
mint
the
flavor
is
similar
what
comes
through
the
strongest
is
a
slightly
smokey
chocolate
character
with
a
hint
of
mint
and
dark
fruit
the
beer
is
very
creamy
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
one
that
i
would
absolutely
buy
drink
again
and
recommend
that
being
said
i
will
still
take
a
deschutes
black
butte
porter
over
this
one
for
price
availability
and
quality
this
is
an
excellent
brew
but
i
think
i
like
the
american
porters
style
a
little
better
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
sessionable
and
enjoyable
this
is
one
of
the
first
british
beers
that
i
ever
tried
early
in
my
craft
beer
drinking
experience
and
i
fell
in
love
with
it
well
i
have
to
say
this
really
stood
the
test
of
time
because
i
still
think
it
is
pretty
amazing
o
nice
night
cap
to
drink
with
dried
fruit
and
crackers
easy
to
drink
and
straight
forward
flavours
that
are
simple
and
well
defined
since
it
isnt
super
rich
like
some
stoutsamerican
porters
it
drinks
very
nicely
good
balance
of
flavor
and
a
nice
overall
porter
i
definitely
think
this
beer
falls
inline
with
the
other
quality
offerings
from
sam
smith
in
a
bottle
and
from
whole
foods
in
dc
for
5
99
what
a
great
porter
no
aftertaste
hints
of
coco
coffee
and
burnt
vanilla
its
also
listed
at
stores
for
2
it
was
thinner
in
body
than
expected
and
i
liked
that
i
didnt
feel
like
i
was
getting
full
on
rate
beer
its
listed
as
a
98
and
99
5
etoh
i
would
consider
this
a
good
starter
porter
to
drink
at
cellar
t
13
c
this
was
consumed
at
room
temperature
the
aromas
were
the
only
real
let
down
but
this
is
a
quality
english
porter
overall
this
is
my
favorite
porter
and
the
standard
i
compare
all
other
porters
to
even
through
this
beer
nails
the
style
category
i
personally
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
the
overwhelmingly
dry
bitter
roastiness
was
simply
too
much
to
handle
and
the
thin
body
left
something
to
be
desired
overall
very
tough
to
beat
o
every
bit
deserving
as
one
of
the
best
english
porters
out
there
only
slightly
edged
out
by
fullers
which
ill
be
having
next
o
a
delicious
and
interesting
porter
the
gold
standard
for
he
style
smooth
as
silk
what
a
great
beer
it
gets
better
as
it
goes
down
o
this
is
a
beer
that
id
definitely
return
to
it
doesnt
go
overboard
in
any
way
and
is
consistent
throughout
nice
example
of
an
english
porter
smooth
and
creamy
with
low
amount
of
carbonation
it
just
glides
down
drying
overall
a
referencequality
english
porter
im
sure
there
are
better
ones
out
there
but
this
one
is
good
and
always
readily
available
o
good
beer
worth
a
try
overall
an
old
original
has
held
its
own
over
time
what
this
lacks
in
strong
flavors
it
makes
up
for
in
smooth
creamy
beautifully
carbonated
mouthfeel
o
probably
the
best
porter
ive
ever
tasted
no
i
take
that
back
definitely
the
best
porter
ive
ever
tasted
i
already
knew
samuel
smith
knew
how
to
make
good
beer
and
this
just
proves
it
further
rjt
very
good
porter
that
all
comes
together
with
each
drink
has
it
all
great
beginning
middle
and
end
o
a
top
notch
porter
no
wonder
its
famous
robust
pleasant
pairs
well
with
cheddar
will
drink
again
oh
yes
i
will
o
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
extremely

would
have
this
again

a
joy

was
floored
as
to
how
many
things
i
was
able
to
smell
however
the
flavor
just
wasnt
quite

not
great
the
beer
is

this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
so
much
flavor
and
class
as
far
as
porters
go
this
truly
sets
the

lets
go

cheers
o
it
deserves
a
try
for
sure
good
understanding
of
a
porter
remember
to
drink
around
13ºc
overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
porter
i
would
recommend
picking
this
beer
up
i
think
it
is
great
that
this
beer
is
so
readily
available
cheers
moderate

taddy
porter
is
probably
one
of
the
best
english
porters
that
ive
had
its
robust
easy
drinking
and
quite
tasty
o
awesome
imperial
stout
only
5
means
you
can
have
multiple
brews
great
flavors
and
aromas
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
has
lots
of
flavours
going
on
but
none
of
them
very
potent
or
cloying
worth
trying
and
id
have
it
again
anytime
fairly
average
in
all
categories
but
a
good
beer
overall
nonetheless
o
good
porter
easy
drinking
overall
best
brown
porter
ive
had
overall
a
benchmark
porter
one
that
is
very
drinkable
i
can
only
drink
one
beer
of
the
very
smoky
ones
but
this
i
could
have
a
few
overall
fantastic
i
love
this
beer
o
ive
never
had
the
pleasure
of
grabbing
a
quick
pint
at
a
pub
in
the
uk
but
i
can
imagine
that
this
must
be
a
fairly
respectable
representation
a
real
treat
o
this
was
the
more
fruity
of
the
two
porters
both
are
excellent
but
i
liked
fullers
just
a
bit
more
smells
like
a
porter
with
a
bit
of
coffee
the
taste
is
wonderful
what
got
me
is
the
metallic
zing
that
really
makes
my
mouth
water
and
pucker
im
a
sour
nut
and
while
this
isnt
sour
at
all
that
metallicness
brings
out
that
similar
mouth
watering
sensation
that
sours
have
real
nice
medium
bodied
the
medium
carbonation
on
this
keeps
it
light
and
almost
stings
the
tongue
the
beer
is
creamy
goodness
pours
a
dark
brown
but
settles
in
black
as
night
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
tan
frothy
head
two
minutes
later
a
seafoam
cap
is
left
floating
on
top
with
patchy
lacing
as
a
reminder
of
what
once
was
smell
is
typical
for
porters
roasted
malts
give
off
decent
aromas
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
taste
provides
the
same
except
with
a
metallic
taste
mixed
in
mouthfeel
is
aa
rich
slick
medium
body
with
the
metallic
flavor
making
me
pucker
also
has
a
slight
bitter
end
from
the
coffee
flavors
overall
i
feel
there
are
better
porters
that
should
be
sought
out
before
this
one
namely
founders
fullers
and
great
lakes
however
if
none
of
them
are
available
this
is
a
decent
starter
porter
for
someone
mouthfeel
is
thin
an
excellent
porter
highly
recommend
to
all
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
of
a
dusty
offwhite
foam
great
voluminous
retention
and
some
decent
lace
even
for
the
serving
vessel
nose
has
some
cocoa
some
sam
smith
hard
watermetallic
notes
a
creamy
sweetness
with
even
a
hint
of
tartness
taste
has
some
copper
some
dark
fruit
notes
and
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
and
again
a
shade
of
some
tartness
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
a
bit
of
roast
in
the
finish
low
carbonation
a
nice
porter
but
i
cant
seem
to
get
past
these
copper
notes
its
like
sucking
on
a
penny
ive
experienced
this
to
differing
degrees
in
sam
smith
beers
but
this
one
or
at
least
this
bottle
seems
to
have
it
in
substantial
amounts
o
overall
its
a
nice
sweet
beer
without
being
syrupy
or
heavy
it
would
work
great
as
a
dinner
beer
where
you
dont
want
to
have
a
strong
overpowering
flavor
it
would
also
work
well
with
a
dessert
i
would
drink
it
again
but
its
not
the
best
porter
o
very
solid
english
porter
not
quite
as
good
as
fullers
london
pride
imo
but
a
close
second
and
miles
ahead
of
anything
else
that
ive
had
overall
this
beer
is
just
about
perfect
its
delicious
with
complex
flavors
that
work
hand
in
hand
if
you
like
porters
do
check
this
one
out
well
done
samuel
smith
so
the
first
time
i
had
a
samuel
smith
beer
it
had
that
metallic
taste
to
it
that
kind
of
ruined
it
for
me
why
ive
never
reviewed
the
oatmeal
stout
and
i
noticed
hints
of
that
at
points
in
here
but
either
it
went
away
or
i
just
topped
noticing
it
because
by
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
it
wasnt
a
problem
ill
be
honest
i
didnt
feel
that
this
lived
up
to
the
billing
it
seems
to
have
received
as
one
of
the
premiere
brews
of
its
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
certainly
enjoyable
but
i
didnt
feel
that
it
was
the
life
changing
end
all
be
all
of
porters
that
it
seems
to
have
been
attributed
as
being
check
it
out
decide
for
yourself
o
this
is
an
excellent
english
porter
ive
yet
to
find
a
samuel
smith
beer
that
disappoints
me
drinkability
a
solid
version
of
the
black
stuff
drinking
a
couple
more
would
give
me
a
heinous
hangover
but
it
would
be
well
worth
it
o
man
i
really
love
this
beer
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
so
i
dont
get
a
chance
to
try
this
very
often
but
it
is
so
very
good
m
dry
and
chalky
but
with
a
center
that
resembles
a
stout
very
drinkable
for
such
a
tasty
porter
its
a
good
beer
but
just
not
the
best
porter
ive
had
lacks
the
malty
pop
i
kind
of
expected
and
the
off
twang
detracts
a
bit
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
not
their
best
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
this
porter
is
not
going
to
be
the
mouthpunch
edmund
fitzy
or
the
like
is
but
it
does
a
great
job
of
just
being
a
chill
porter
sit
back
and
idle
the
day
away
with
one
of
these
in
your
glass
and
five
more
waiting
for
you
in
the
cooler
cheers
moderately
creamy
but
with
a
body
thats
on
the
thinner
side
medium
carbonation
very
sessionable
not
as
profound
and
complex
as
some
of
the
contemporary
porters
but
still
an
exemplar
of
the
style
an
excellent
porter
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
delicious
and
smooth
this
is
a
fantastic
session
porter
wellbalanced
and
a
porter
lovers
dream
excellent
very
dark
almost
pitch
black
when
poured
into
a
glass
main
smell
is
sweet
this
may
sound
weird
but
it
almost
smells
like
a
mix
between
coffee
with
cream
and
a
banana
something
about
the
fruit
notes
smell
very
banana
like
to
me
the
taste
is
creamy
has
a
sweet
taste
almost
like
coffee
and
cream
slightly
tangy
on
the
other
side
with
more
of
sour
taste
then
bitter
per
say
mouthfeel
is
solid
good
carbonation
starts
creamy
less
so
as
it
warms
up
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
cant
say
its
something
i
want
to
drink
on
a
normal
basis
the
smell
and
taste
is
a
very
interesting
profile
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
im
actually
quite
glad
i
had
this
but
i
will
probably
only
drink
it
occasionally
overall
very
unimpressed
given
the
beers
reputation
skip
this
one
and
just
go
straight
to
the
samuel
smith
imperial
stout
o
quite
easily
the
best
porter
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
each
different
aspect
of
this
beer
complements
the
next
so
well
its
a
beautiful
thing
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slowly
disapating
head
scent
is
that
of
mixed
malts
some
roasted
a
little
hazelnut
and
other
roasted
scents
taste
is
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
bitterdry
tone
not
exactly
watery
but
the
taste
feels
very
light
on
the
taste
buds
a
nice
slow
drinking
pub
kind
of
beer
that
drinks
great
very
easy
to
see
why
its
called
the
famous
taddy
porter

i
dont
know
how
the
nose
is
so
good

the
taste
is
so
mediocre
either
way
for
some

i
expected
a

a

looking

this

out
solid
nothing
more
to
say
earthy
chocolatey
the
perfect
balance
of
dry
and
sweet
there
are
many
better
examples
but
its
easy
to
see
how
they
grew
from
this
o
a
pretty
good
beer
solid
flavor
profile
just
wish
it
was
a
little
thicker
and
creamier
o
at
times
samuel
smith
disappoints
me
but
this
is
obviously
not
one
of
those
times
this
is
the
best
drink
they
have
offered
me
and
when
the
claim
its
the
famous
taddy
porter
they
are
not
lying
smooth
almost
creamy
in
texture
this
slides
down
the
throat
far
to
easily
luckily
it
leaves
a
rich
film
of
the
aforementioned
flavours
on
your
teeth
this
leads
you
into
thinking
it
has
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
but
you
cant
tell
because
youve
already
taken
another
great
swig
of
the
beer
and
so
it
goes
on
until
you
are
spent
and
there
is
no
more
a
great
beer
and
so
so
easy
to
drink
a
good
tasting
beer
with
many
layers
of
flavor
but
that
flavor
may
be
just
a
little
too
subtle
not
as
as
sturdy
or
robust
as
fullers
london
porter
this
is
nevertheless
an
excellent
beer
the
lack
of
the
smokiness
of
this
beer
which
fullers
has
makes
this
a
lighter
and
easier
to
drink
but
perhaps
slightly
less
memorable
british
porter
still
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
porter
subtleties
make
this
one
complex
and
its
well
blended
nature
make
it
an
easy
drinker
my
third
review
from
samuel
smith
and
at
4
25
this
is
my
lowest
rated
one
amazing
brewery
o
what
you
would
expect
from
an
english
porter
in
both
a
good
and
bad
way
nothing
crazynewinteresting
flavor
wise
but
very
well
balance
well
crafted
and
flavorful
quite
sessionable
and
about
as
much
flavor
as
a
5
beer
will
carry
good
beer
to
have
with
a
hearty
meal
would
make
a
great
breakfast
beer
glad
i
tried
it
low
abv
smooth
drinkability
and
wide
availability
makes
this
extremely
sessionable
and
a
nice
go
to
beer
for
the
colder
months
perhaps
a
bit
pricey
at
11
for
a
4
pack
go
to
english
porter
overall
i
must
say
that
this
was
a
much
better
than
average
beer
its
not
so
pricey
that
i
cant
have
it
every
once
in
a
while
for
which
i
am
grateful
i
am
definitely
looking
forward
to
my
next
bottle
of
taddy
porter
overall
really
for
an
english
porter
this
is
fabulous
beer
no
tinkering
necessary
with
craft
o
overall
an
above
average
porter
with
something
a
little
weird
in
the
nose
taste
is
pretty
good
and
very
sweet
and
roasted
and
the
mouthfeel
is
great
would
give
another
shot
but
not
my
favorite
porter
m
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
longlived
it
begins
with
a
sharp
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
quickly
changes
to
a
lingering
dryness
which
mimics
that
of
a
merlot
or
shiraz
wine
the
slight
burnt
flavor
and
dryness
both
likely
arise
from
the
roasted
malts
which
go
into
this
beer
overall
a
porter
with
a
strong
english
character
solid
and
accessible
but
not
dazzling
taste
is
mellow
crisp
and
smooth
a
light
hop
bite
but
well
balanced
with
the
caramel
malt
flavors
the
body
is
very
light
and
watery
it
almost
tastes
and
looks
like
a
nitro
beer
finish
is
crisp
and
smooth
making
my
lips
feel
ever
so
slightly
sticky
pours
black
with
an
inch
and
a
half
of
creamtan
colored
head
really
nice
lacing
and
solid
retention
smells
like
creamy
roasted
malt
dry
woodiness
faint
dark
fruit
dark
chocolate
with
some
cherry
and
vanilla
extract
coming
to
the
surface
as
it
warms
taste
is
mostly
restrained
roasted
malt
finishing
dry
and
slightly
minerally
light
carbonation
and
mediumlight
body
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
porter
quite
drinkable
but
perhaps
a
bit
one
dimensional
on
the
taste
i
dont
like
my
porters
super
roasty
porters
and
this
one
manages
to
be
restrained
enough
to
be
drinkable
definitely
in
the
top
tier
of
porters
o
its
the
standard
in
this
style
if
you
ask
its
hard
for
me
to
pick
a
winner
so
ill
cop
out
and
also
give
this
one
4
5s
across
the
board
i
read
porter
has
fallen
out
favor
in
britain
which
is
a
shame
if
it
means
the
britons
arent
drinking
as
much
of
this
delicious
brew
o
a
damn
good
beer
that
surprised
me
on
all
fronts
i
really
like
the
conception
of
porters
ive
gained
from
american
styles
but
if
this
is
what
a
real
british
portertastes
like
than
i
would
love
to
try
more
samples
of
them
o
overall
i
dont
particularly
like
this
beer
it
doesnt
scream
porter
to
me
but
i
could
just
be
used
to
the
american
porters
the
sweetness
just
wasnt
what
i
was
looking
for
if
thats
your
scene
this
is
the
beer
for
you
just
not
what
i
wanted
overal
a
good
porter
this
poured
out
with
a
nice
deep
brown
colored
body
the
head
was
a
light
tan
color
that
actually
have
a
good
amount
of
retention
and
lacing
for
a
porter
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
plenty
of
roasted
dark
malts
aromas
and
some
light
earthy
hops
aromas
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
little
metallic
at
first
buy
faded
nicely
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
flavored
of
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
were
dominant
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
creamy
and
rich
with
a
good
carbonation
level
overall
its
a
damn
good
porter
o
my
first
english
porter
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
cross
between
an
american
nut
brown
and
an
american
porter
dark
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
mixed
with
more
caramel
toffee
wood
and
nuttiness
not
as
much
roasted
character
as
i
like
in
dark
beers
but
overall
pretty
pleasant
overall
a
great
porter
from
samuel
smith
with
an
interesting
mixture
of
dark
malts
and
fruity
flavor
the
beer
appears
black
dark
brown
at
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
with
an
inch
of
thick
beige
head
as
the
cap
slowly
recedes
it
leaves
a
sheet
of
lacing
cascading
down
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
has
a
strong
chocolate
presence
with
some
roasted
malt
behind
the
flavor
continues
with
a
tasty
chocolate
character
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
a
nice
bready
malty
finish
a
really
tasty
beverage
i
cant
believe
i
havent
had
this
before
the
chocolate
component
is
perhaps
a
bit
heavy
but
overall
the
flavor
is
pleasant
not
too
sweet
i
could
throw
back
a
few
pints
of
this
i
bet
this
is
fantastic
on
cask
overall
good
beer
overall
another
fine
offering
from
samuel
smith
the
only
thing
holding
this
one
back
is
that
the
flavor
seems
to
fade
too
quickly
definitely
worth
a
shot
i
still
like
the
oatmeal
stout
better
but
that
is
purely
personal
preference
this
one
pulls
its
weight
for
sure
they
dont
call
it
the
famous
taddy
porter
for
nothing
this
is
a
classic
beer
for
sure
and
a
signature
aspect
of
sam
smiths
lineup
o
very
average
porter
wouldnt
buy
again
and
not
sss
best
a
lighter
sytle
of
porter
very
good
beer
d
very
easy
drinking
english
brown
porter
just
not
my
favorite
style
but
still
quaffable
appearance
45
aroma
45
taste
35
mouthfeel
45
overall
45
o
its
been
said
a
million
times
but
this
is
just
a
great
porter
very
drinkable
great
taste
winner
all
the
way
around
d
well
balanced
d
this
beer
sets
the
standard
for
porter
english
or
otherwise
one
of
my
favorites
on
a
sunday
the
color
is
like
black
garnet
when
held
up
to
the
light
this
and
several
others
are
making
me
a
porter
lover
its
fairly
thin
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
but
then
thats
the
style
its
appropriate
overall
this
is
a
textbook
english
porter
its
very
enjoyable
please
message
me
with
any
recommendations
on
similar
portersstouts
overall
a
great
traditional
british
porter
paired
well
with
saturday
morning
football
overall
this
is
a
very
good
english
porter
tasty
yet
very
easy
to
drink
overall
very
good
the
biggest
letdown
really
was
the
mouthfeel
i
really
expect
something
amazing
from
samuel
smiths
when
it
comes
to
easing
the
pallet
and
this
beer
just
didnt
deliver
carbonation
just
killed
the
feeling
but
for
all
ive
said
still
a
good
beer
and
worthy
of
a
taste
o
a
straightforward
porter
easy
to
drink
with
any
occasion
goes
down
smooth
but
its
not
earth
shattering
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
not
quite
opaque
the
head
is
tan
tall
and
foamy
it
smells
of
maple
syrup
caramel
and
roasted
with
a
slight
tang
the
beer
is
big
on
roasted
malt
and
its
very
metallic
and
tangy
there
is
also
a
hint
of
coffee
and
molasses
its
medium
bodied
with
some
stinging
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
this
is
a
great
porter
with
a
nice
tang
to
it
notes
this
one
is
reminiscent
of
guinness
extra
stout
and
that
is
certainly
a
good
thing
oone
of
the
few
beers
that
continues
to
get
better
as
you
drink
it
if
i
were
to
suggest
one
thing
itd
be
to
drink
this
warmer
than
colder
it
is
a
smooth
a
great
drinking
porter
much
more
easy
to
drink
than
some
of
the
more
flavorful
porters
my
12
ounce
bottle
disappeared
rather
quickly
and
i
was
sad
when
it
was
gone
o
im
surprised
i
took
so
long
to
pick
this
one
up
on
the
scale
of
porters
this
one
is
on
the
top
of
the
spectrum
overall
this
is
one
great
beer
and
definitely
would
have
again
and
again
pours
dark
brown
pretty
much
opaque
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
this
beer
has
a
lovely
roasted
barley
aroma
with
hints
of
alcohol
chocolate
and
coffee
this
is
a
pretty
full
bodied
beer
with
an
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
it
has
a
lovely
roasted
character
with
definite
notes
of
malts
chocolate
some
coffee
and
very
subtle
hops
in
the
background
the
beer
finishes
with
bitter
roasted
cocoa
pretty
drinkable
for
being
such
a
heavy
beer
one
of
my
favorite
porters
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
auburn
tones
in
the
light
its
got
halfinch
head
and
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
with
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
coffee
and
toast
the
flavor
is
very
complex
and
balanced
beginning
with
dark
chocolate
followed
by
cocoa
powder
and
coffee
with
milk
chocolate
and
some
slight
molasses
notes
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
samuel
smiths
the
famous
taddy
porter
is
an
excellent
beer
smooth
complex
balanced
and
drinkable
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
this
beer
was
around
average
slightly
above
nothing
really
stuck
out
with
this
beer
it
had
some
nice
creamy
tastes
to
it
but
as
the
beer
went
on
that
some
what
faded
i
believe
the
attempt
was
to
do
a
light
porter
which
was
pretty
good
but
nothing
that
really
caught
my
attention
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
if
some
one
handed
me
a
free
one
i
would
definitely
drink
it
but
there
isnt
anything
that
made
me
come
away
wanting
more
o
pretty
much
the
perfect
dark
beer
i
am
really
holding
myself
back
from
giving
this
all
5s
as
i
am
not
quite
sure
how
theyd
improve
it
this
is
the
top
of
the
line
as
far
as
craft
beer
goes
notes
overall
one
of
the
more
complex
english
porters
this
stuff
is
awesome
fullbodied
yet
incredibly
drinkable
in
a
session
setting
ive
had
this
beer
numerous
times
and
every
time
i
have
it
i
sense
more
and
more
it
just
goes
to
show
how
worldclass
the
brews
that
sam
smith
has
to
offer
a
benchmark
beer
for
this
style
o
wellbalanced
but
not
huge
in
the
palate
there
are
some
breweries
that
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
old
sammy
smith
i
dont
always
want
an
extreme
flavorfisting
palateraping
meltdown
of
10
abv
when
im
drinking
a
dark
beer
sometimes
i
just
want
a
solid
flavorful
beer
with
a
palate
so
versatile
that
i
can
drink
it
casually
and
thats
exactly
what
taddy
porters
all
about
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
has
som
e
chocoate
roasted
malts
taste
is
the
same
roasted
malts
with
chocolate
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
high
quality
beer
doverall
i
like
this
brew
it
was
very
creamy
and
smooth
but
still
had
great
balance
and
great
flavors
coming
out
it
might
have
felt
alittle
thin
at
times
even
with
the
creamyness
comin
through
would
get
this
again
for
sure
taste
was
creamy
as
expected
and
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
sweet
and
coffee
like
as
it
warmed
the
bitterness
ramped
up
slightly
but
didnt
become
anything
bad
this
beer
tasted
good
cold
and
slightly
warmed
mouthfeel
was
heavy
and
carbonation
was
good
this
beer
tasted
just
as
it
looked
creamy
and
sweet
good
beer
but
i
probably
wont
revisit
it
drink
to
think
i
never
had
this
to
me
was
a
crime
against
beer
this
should
be
on
a
list
for
noob
beer
drinkers
introduces
layering
to
the
palate
and
just
very
well
done
id
have
this
again
for
sure
the
appearance
o
this
beer
is
the
best
part
it
pours
a
dark
brown
to
almos
black
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
to
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
chocolatey
the
tasted
follows
through
with
a
slightly
sweet
almost
cola
like
aspect
there
is
no
hop
flavor
present
in
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
overall
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
but
good
none
the
less
o
recommended
would
drink
again
very
drinkable
a
sweetish
porter
but
one
of
the
greats
do
i
believe
this
to
be
my
first
porter
love
back
in
the
day
and
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
one
but
it
still
holds
its
own
as
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
unexpectedly
low
abv
for
as
much
flavor
as
it
packs
my
pour
created
just
better
than
a
finger
of
lightbrown
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
rubygarnetmahogany
highlights
nose
was
chocolaty
with
a
slight
underlying
tang
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
had
a
smoky
chocolatiness
to
it
on
the
tongue
finish
was
quite
smoky
charcoallike
in
its
intensity
very
dry
wow
this
is
probably
the
exemplary
beer
for
its
style
but
i
had
forgotten
its
intensity
as
compared
to
a
lot
of
the
american
versions
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
but
not
on
a
hot
summers
day
after
weeding
the
backyard
pours
black
brown
on
the
edges
and
is
somewhat
translucent
there
is
a
chunky
tan
froth
atop
the
brew
initially
which
recedes
to
an
encircling
wisp
in
short
order
the
nose
is
roasty
and
nutty
with
faint
hints
of
smoke
and
soy
sauce
there
is
also
a
plumlike
dark
fruitiness
the
flavor
delivers
on
the
advertising
of
the
aroma
hints
of
smoke
are
subtle
yet
especially
impactful
fruity
notes
are
more
subdued
nutty
impressions
are
stronger
and
toastier
and
there
is
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
which
adds
to
the
robust
character
the
feel
is
silky
and
creamy
and
just
what
i
like
from
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
given
the
brewer
id
expect
nothing
less
o
insanely
drinkable
a
very
simple
but
topnotch
porter
i
really
never
get
tired
of
drinking
this
beer
an
enjoyable
english
my
favorite
samuel
smiths
offering
to
date
pours
a
dark
brown
black
with
a
nice
brown
med
head
with
good
lacing
nose
is
dark
roasted
malts
with
some
cacao
dark
fruitiness
taste
is
roasted
malts
cacao
some
plums
palate
is
nice
med
to
full
body
with
nice
carbonation
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
finish
is
sweet
roasted
caramel
malts
cacao
with
a
nice
light
licorice
flavor
and
some
light
bittering
hops
add
some
balance
overall
a
very
good
creamy
and
smooth
porter
very
nice
dont
get
me
wrong
its
good
but
its
not
great
nothing
to
brag
about
it
has
a
pretty
cool
story
regardless
i
could
drink
this
all
day
love
it
overall
still
impressive
but
i
think
theres
a
few
others
i
prefer
than
this
but
this
could
do
anytime
for
sure
o
always
satisfies
thread
o
a
tasty
english
porter
and
a
solid
sample
of
the
style
grab
one
for
yourself
because
i
know
ill
be
grabbing
another
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
as
always
overall
taddy
porter
is
a
classic
english
porter
a
bit
less
robust
and
sweeter
than
some
of
the
porters
coming
out
of
americas
craft
breweries
but
delicious
nonetheless
just
an
amazing
beer
and
really
the
prototype
for
english
porters
wish
i
could
get
this
fresh
but
pretty
solid
as
is
drinks
very
well
and
really
has
a
unique
complexity
to
it
this
could
be
pretty
sessionable
a
nice
well
rounded
beer
o
this
was
a
real
treat
for
a
free
beer
handed
to
me
at
work
i
had
no
idea
this
was
so
good
best
porter
ive
ever
had
hands
down
i
seems
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
this
brewery
despite
the
high
price
and
no
freshness
dates
every
product
i
have
tried
has
been
very
fresh
there
are
many
great
american
porters
but
if
you
are
seeking
an
english
version
this
is
the
one
to
choose
note
if
there
were
marks
for
value
i
would
be
forced
to
give
it
a
fairly
low
rating
reason
being
edmund
fitzgerald
is
available
for
96pack
while
taddy
is
104pack
just
not
worth
the
when
a
superior
product
is
available
for
less
but
if
you
have
no
other
options
its
a
decent
choice
taste
is
charcoal
malt
bitter
cocoa
this
is
a
really
complex
drink
that
gets
better
with
every
sip
you
would
never
know
this
is
not
a
high
gravity
beer
the
lighter
alcohol
does
lead
to
a
slightly
watery
mouth
feel
i
know
i
am
spoiled
with
all
the
american
thick
stuff
flavorwise
this
one
is
really
good
the
taste
brings
out
the
vanilla
and
liqurice
more
clearly
a
bit
of
roasty
bitterness
there
aswell
there
is
a
thick
and
almost
a
little
creamy
body
and
breathing
out
through
the
nose
it
burns
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
there
this
is
an
excellent
porter
hits
the
spot
with
complex
flavors
and
perfect
balance
ive
found
the
other
stouts
from
samuel
smith
to
be
underwhelming
if
not
down
right
poor
examples
of
their
style
this
porter
gives
me
renewed
hope
that
this
brewery
can
actually
make
good
beer
very
possibly
the
best
dark
beer
from
the
uk
not
barrel
aged
but
thats
really
not
saying
too
much
taste
dark
cherries
up
front
followed
by
bitter
coffee
finishes
dry
with
rumraisen
notes
o
definitely
a
good
porter
not
as
great
as
i
remember
in
the
past
fullers
is
far
superior
for
an
english
porter
imho
that
said
this
is
nicer
than
many
this
beer
pours
a
black
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
that
stayed
with
the
beer
the
smell
is
a
bit
smokey
very
roboust
and
heavy
the
taste
is
initally
watery
but
then
a
dry
smoked
flavor
hits
the
palettee
nice
carrbonation
for
a
porter
overall
a
bit
different
but
fantastic
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
the
creamy
mouthfeel
helped
along
by
the
deep
mocha
head
as
a
whole
this
seemed
to
be
characteristic
of
an
english
porter
the
slight
bitterness
and
sourness
was
indicative
of
the
style
and
more
specifically
something
coming
out
of
the
uk
what
detracted
a
bit
for
us
was
the
overwhelming
carbonation
which
while
it
lent
to
the
head
and
mouthfeel
became
bothersome
by
the
end
although
a
little
dark
for
a
porter
this
is
nonetheless
an
outstanding
brew
nearly
stoutworthy
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
o
2
reasons
why
i
would
move
to
england
1
to
follow
the
barclays
premiere
league
2
to
drink
samuel
smiths
on
the
regular
i
have
yet
to
come
across
a
samuel
smiths
beer
that
has
dissapointed
me
could
definitely
session
this
not
the
best
porter
wouldnt
say
it
should
be
called
famous
but
id
definitely
call
it
good
d
i
expected
this
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
than
it
is
creamy
sweetness
rather
than
caramel
notes
that
i
expected
my
wifes
pick
to
pair
with
a
seafood
dinner
for
her
birthday
o
pretty
good
beer
i
havent
had
many
english
porters
but
if
this
is
one
of
the
best
ill
stick
with
the
american
style
when
you
put
famous
on
your
beers
label
it
better
be
darn
good
this
beer
is
its
varied
wellbalanced
and
just
really
tasty
though
it
could
do
with
a
touch
less
sweetness
and
with
the
low
abv
its
a
very
sessionable
porter
o
taddy
packs
a
wallop
of
flavor
without
the
necessity
of
pesky
heavy
alcohol
our
american
versions
have
highly
drinkable
its
a
session
porter
if
there
ever
was
one
god
bless
the
english
brews
o
a
super
easy
drinking
porter
if
the
price
wasnt
so
high
compared
to
many
of
the
other
great
porters
about
2x
oz
for
oz
compared
to
anchor
porter
sn
porter
etc
it
would
be
a
regular
purchase
not
as
good
as
some
make
it
out
to
be
but
i
can
dig
it
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
just
enough
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
even
if
it
drinks
like
a
stronger
brew

this
was
another
great
dark
brew
from
sam
smith
pours
out
near
black
in
color
with
a
foamy
brown
head
and
a
opaque
blackness
that
is
mesmerizing
it
has
an
aroma
of
roasted
malts
chocalate
and
medicinal
hops
very
nice
tastes
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
toffee
grassy
grains
and
medicinal
hops
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
coating
and
wetting
overall
this
is
a
gorgeous
beer
and
a
best
in
class
porter
this
porter
has
it
all
the
famous
taddy
porter
is
right
this
beer
is
creamy
smooth
tastey
and
down
right
delicious
compared
to
other
porters
the
biggest
difference
in
this
one
is
the
mouthfeel
at
times
this
can
be
a
little
ambiguous
with
beer
but
when
this
fills
your
mouth
you
will
appreciate
this
category
the
smell
and
taste
are
the
perfect
goldilocks
3
bears
blend
of
just
right
not
too
much
not
enough
just
right
this
is
a
great
beer
and
feels
brighter
and
lighter
on
the
tongue
than
the
color
suggests
however
the
dark
brew
yummy
flavors
are
still
hidden
in
there
so
you
are
not
skimpedof
flavor
a
wonderful
beer
and
i
will
absolutely
go
for
it
again
overall
i
was
blown
away
by
this
porter
it
is
my
first
brew
from
samuel
smith
and
i
am
a
believer
looking
forward
to
their
oatmeal
stout
i
will
definitely
pick
up
more
of
these
i
paid
4
for
this
550ml
bottle
and
to
me
that
is
a
steal
truly
an
amazing
porter
world
class
i
might
get
another
tonight
overall
fantastic
all
you
could
want
in
a
beer
flavor
balance
low
alcohol
and
seems
to
be
avaible
most
places
easy
a
top
5
porter
on
the
planet
o
hard
to
beat
this
porter
as
it
offers
a
lot
pours
very
dark
slightly
ruby
with
an
off
white
head
didnt
last
long
but
more
than
likely
it
was
the
way
my
glass
was
cleaned
sweat
almost
yeasty
aroma
tangy
in
the
flavor
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
bitter
and
slight
roasty
notes
in
the
middle
finishes
dry
with
hints
of
chocolate
one
of
the
better
aftertastes
youll
have
drinking
beer
stays
in
the
mouth
like
sweet
coffee
d
very
high
even
with
all
the
roastiness
this
is
one
that
you
can
enjoy
from
start
to
finish
any
time
of
the
day
just
a
really
good
example
of
what
a
porter
should
be
md
the
texture
is
so
well
rounded
in
this
beer
that
its
hard
do
recognize
any
sort
of
bite
in
the
finish
each
sip
goes
down
smooth
and
carbonation
is
perfect
to
allow
the
flavors
to
show
through
and
not
come
off
too
rough
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
flavors
of
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
tinge
of
smokiness
also
has
hint
of
roastiness
but
no
burntcoffee
like
flavors
incredibly
smooth
sweet
and
easy
drinking
medium
acidic
bite
typical
of
porters
i
feel
this
would
be
a
great
thirst
quencher
while
eating
a
hearty
roast
overall
excellent
quite
a
satisfying
porter
a
top
beer
in
my
book
and
another
excellent
beer
from
samuel
smith
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
tan
brown
mocha
color
to
the
massive
sized
head
leaving
definite
clear
rings
of
lacing
to
it
slight
fruity
approach
mixture
of
hops
in
there
to
balance
out
the
semi
smoked
deep
roasted
malts
that
provide
chocolate
and
some
coffee
tones
very
nice
definitely
an
acquired
bitterness
with
a
pleasant
array
of
rolling
sharp
sweet
tones
blended
with
the
coffee
and
chocolate
available
along
with
a
sharp
ale
yeast
driven
fruitiness
a
bit
thin
and
needs
some
texture
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
big
offwhite
head
taddy
porter
smells
like
roasted
malts
nuts
and
dark
chocolate
very
lowkey
it
tastes
quite
nice
with
roasted
barley
plum
dark
chocolate
and
other
flavors
coming
across
mf
is
just
right
for
a
porter
with
a
proper
carbonation
level
this
classic
from
sam
smith
drinks
well
another
very
good
beer
from
them
d
the
smoothness
aids
drinkability
dramatically
an
enjoyable
beer
and
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
expecting
i
may
like
it
even
more
the
second
time
around
drinkability
is
great
nice
balance
a
good
example
for
the
english
porter
style
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
goes
down
a
bit
harsh
but
alright
thanks
russ
damn
you
really
have
to
let
this
sit
for
a
long
while
to
reap
its
rewards
cherish
its
charms
at
times
its
nearly
watery
and
then
it
turns
around
and
goes
prickly
slick
teasing
dryish
real
good
nothing
to
drink
a
4pack
slowly
take
your
time
the
cpj
poured
a
2
head
which
dissipated
to
14
clear
dark
raw
umber
color
the
smell
is
divine
with
ample
coffee
chocolate
and
malt
taste
is
a
little
more
subdued
than
the
smell
but
still
has
all
those
same
things
plus
a
little
tart
zing
and
a
pretty
long
finish
not
really
unique
or
special
but
nonetheless
a
classic
example
of
a
good
porter
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
brew
as
i
am
with
all
the
samuel
smiths
brews
definitely
will
have
more
of
these
in
the
future
notes
i
definitely
recommend
this
porter
awesome
flavor
with
a
dark
creamy
feel
to
it
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
however
like
most
porters
i
do
not
find
them
to
be
enough
that
is
why
i
have
a
bias
towards
stouts
porters
to
me
are
like
baby
stouts
that
is
they
arent
mature
or
what
theyre
meant
to
be
im
not
taking
anything
away
from
the
taddy
porter
though
its
a
good
beer
that
happens
to
be
in
a
style
that
i
tend
to
not
find
as
enjoyable
as
stouts
im
sorry
overall
i
couldnt
believe
what
this
was
when
it
was
unveiled
i
had
a
good
experience
with
this
beer
a
year
before
this
was
a
disaster
hopefully
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
at
the
blind
tasting
but
at
the
price
im
not
too
eager
to
buy
it
again
very
very
disappointing
for
all
five
of
us
d
this
beer
was
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
low
abv
does
make
this
one
very
drinkable
and
i
did
drink
a
lot
of
it
flavorful
but
not
filling
sam
smith
does
make
excellent
examples
of
the
style
and
everyone
should
seek
out
this
widely
available
brewery
very
very
drinkable
this
one
deserves
the
hype
glad
this
came
to
my
area
as
ive
heard
about
it
for
so
long
definitely
try
it
if
given
the
opportunity
overall
this
was
great
i
really
enjoyed
the
roasted
flavor
and
the
full
on
malt
assault
this
could
have
been
one
of
my
more
favorite
brews
to
date
really
a
top
noth
offering
and
i
would
be
thrilled
to
get
some
more
color
is
pitch
black
but
with
a
tinge
of
burgundy
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
light
about
a
fingers
width
of
a
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
not
much
lacing
left
on
the
glass
either
coffee
scents
are
nice
but
a
bit
weak
its
the
taste
where
this
beer
stands
out
starts
malty
with
hints
of
cocoa
and
caramel
and
finishes
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
with
a
wonderful
fig
aftertaste
nice
mouthfeel
as
well
looking
forward
to
another
one
for
all
that
its
a
drinkable
beer
inoffensive
easy
to
drink
looks
quite
nice
on
the
way
down
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
at
5
it
will
take
quite
a
few
before
youre
drunk
the
great
taste
makes
it
easy
to
consume
very
delicious
beer
its
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
this
was
a
good
porter
nice
balanced
flavor
not
easy
to
drink
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
not
my
favorite
samuel
smith
but
so
so
good
conclusion
as
is
everything
else
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
this
beer
is
wonderful
as
english
as
it
can
be
it
is
subtle
satisfying
and
so
smooth
it
is
unreal
a
great
example
of
a
traditional
british
porter
d
this
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
porter
that
i
have
ever
had
flavor
is
a
great
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
a
bit
milky
this
was
an
extremely
light
mouth
feel
which
is
amazing
with
a
beer
of
this
flavor
you
can
drink
a
lot
this
before
you
know
it
a
fantastic
beer
that
lives
right
up
to
its
reputation
drink
this
from
notes
at
old
chicago
2002
poured
from
bottle
into
english
pint
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
light
brown
head
that
lingers
aroma
of
dark
fruits
plum
fig
roasted
malt
slight
coffee
licorice
type
aroma
taste
is
roast
and
barley
with
dark
fruits
and
some
candied
apple
i
feel
like
it
is
hard
to
characterize
this
one
with
normal
beer
vocabulary
its
an
excellent
porter
which
distinguishes
itself
from
others
with
a
unique
rich
and
complex
aroma
flavor
smooth
slightly
silky
mouth
feel
d
pleasant
plum
notes
and
easy
drinking
but
with
a
slightly
unpleasant
phenolic
astringency
and
a
little
watery
as
well
3
5
d
good
a
couple
pints
would
be
fine
i
have
begun
to
really
grow
a
taste
for
porters
and
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
i
must
say
it
is
pretty
good
easily
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
one
excellent
porter
i
would
buy
the
crap
out
of
this
if
it
was
more
reasonably
priced
but
this
is
a
nice
cold
weather
beer
that
i
could
drink
many
of
super
dark
ultra
clear
cola
with
a
dark
and
plentiful
head
lots
of
lace
all
the
way
down
smell
is
roasty
and
full
of
coffee
and
cocoa
some
dark
bread
and
molasses
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
some
floral
hops
taste
is
a
continuation
of
the
nose
with
nice
hop
finish
that
leaves
coffee
dripping
from
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
a
leafy
hop
dry
bitterness
feel
is
silky
like
the
oatmeal
stout
but
lighter
a
quintessential
session
porter
the
foam
was
a
dark
wheat
in
color
2
finger
depth
smooth
and
lacey
the
color
was
a
very
dark
cola
with
hints
of
amber
in
the
light
the
taste
was
deep
and
bobust
roasted
malt
a
barley
undertone
and
a
crisp
hops
highlight
mouthfeel
crisp
smooth
clean
fullheavy
bodied
but
not
too
heavy
drinkability
smooth
and
was
alot
crispier
and
a
light
feel
than
expected
by
the
color
nice
session
i
could
go
on
and
on
about
this
beer
which
i
have
to
being
short
of
250
characters
like
the
bros
say
world
class
i
like
porters
and
this
is
a
really
good
one
i
would
say
the
high
marks
are
well
deserved
and
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
a
solid
classic
brew
that
everybody
should
drink
every
now
and
then
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewer
but
a
great
porter
nonetheless
medium
body
easy
to
drink
classic
english
porter
d
this
is
fantastic
and
incredibly
quaffable
and
i
found
myself
nearly
gulping
it
at
times
smells
a
little
bit
cornmeally
which
i
did
not
anticipate
the
nutty
malts
dont
taste
stale
though
honestly
a
little
of
a
let
down
after
the
first
sip
starting
to
think
i
should
have
poured
it
colder
very
dry
almost
harsh
finish
unique
but
not
special
this
is
a
great
find
i
picked
the
samuel
smith
oatmeal
out
and
my
girlfriend
convinced
me
to
try
this
and
i
am
ecstatic
great
bitter
quality
but
with
a
smooth
malty
finish
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
very
good
i
can
have
this
one
any
place
and
at
any
time
of
the
day
this
classic
porter
is
a
definite
must
have
for
every
porter

of
sammy

best
and
a
quintessential
porter
drinkability
this
is
my
session
beer
well
american
session

is
the
standard
for

the
beginning

by

some
dry

this
brew
tastes
more
like
american
brown
d
a
delicious
middle
of
the
road
dark
beer
the
5
abv
is
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
from
the
flood
of
imperial
dark
beers
that
have
overtaken
the
marketplace
d
very
well
balanced
and
flavorful
very
easy
to
drink

english
porter
zillion
reviews
for
this
beer
what
else
can
i
say
its
truly
an
exceptional
brew
magnificent
lacing
throughout
the
session
very
well
balanced
roasted
malts
chocolate
the
epitome
of
an
english
porter
at
least
in
my
limited
experience
does
sam
smith
make
a
bad
beer
the
taste
starts
with
roasted
malt
hints
of
coffee
mingled
with
some
fruit
like
dried
plum
or
prune
this
sweetness
of
course
is
kept
in
check
with
a
very
balanced
bitterness
of
mild
hops
and
dark
chocolate
very
smooth
and
creamy
like
all
beers
from
this
great
brewery
very
very
drinkable
this
brewery
has
become
my
favorite
every
beer
you
pick
up
from
them
tastes
great
drinkability
this
is
a
very
very
good
porter
i
dont
think
i
like
this
as
well
as
the
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
but
this
is
still
way
way
above
average
and
worth
a
taste
if
at
all
possible
i
am
definitely
looking
forward
to
picking
this
up
again
it
is
so
easily
drinkable
it
would
be
hard
not
to
like
it
havent
had
a
samuel
smiths
yet
that
i
didnt
like
this
beer
has
a
little
bit
more
carbonation
than
i
really
prefer
but
is
a
solid
porter
that
is
very
drinkable
dm
incredibly
smooth
drinking
brew
aided
by
the
sweetness
nice
carbonation
tingle
nice
smooth
finish
and
slight
lingering
maltiness
d
easy
drinker
nothing
spectacular
about
this
one
there
are
way
better
porters
out
there
pours
a
dark
muddy
brown
color
with
great
cap
of
khaki
brown
head
great
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
earthy
notes
of
bakers
chocolate
pumpernickle
bread
dark
roasted
nuts
day
old
coffee
taste
is
wonderfully
smooth
and
combines
the
components
of
scent
into
a
very
good
beer
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
a
touch
over
carbonated
ingredients
are
plain
and
simple
no
flavors
stand
out
but
a
good
beer
all
around
that
shows
craftsmanship
is
important
opened
a
bottle
of
taddys
porter
on
a
cold
dry
evening
after
a
big
dinner
this
porter
presents
as
well
as
any
bottled
beer
ive
experienced
an
easy
two
inch
full
tancream
colored
head
formed
after
pouring
into
the
glass
and
persisted
for
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
was
fleeting
with
wafts
of
toffee
and
caramel
great
full
bodied
flavor
i
expect
from
a
porter
and
makes
for
an
easy
drink
as
the
robust
flavor
quickly
leaves
the
senses
making
the
drinker
wanting
sip
after
sip
a
creamy
thick
mouthfeel
rounds
out
this
porter
as
one
of
my
favorite
to
date
try
one
hard
to
rate
this
one
i
just
wanted
to
drink
it
wonderful
pour
resulting
in
a
rich
brown
head
of
three
inches
took
better
than
three
minutes
for
the
head
to
clam
down
when
it
did
it
left
an
amazing
lace
the
clings
all
the
way
up
the
rim
the
color
is
a
39
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
great
aroma
of
chocolate
coffee
caramel
toffee
and
molasses
flavors
of
chocolate
coffee
toffee
licorice
caramel
molasses
butter
and
spice
rum
lots
of
body
in
my
mouth
like
heavy
cream
smooth
and
rich
this
is
a
great
beer
it
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
i
little
pricey
but
worth
it
overall
this
is
the
best
porter
that
ive
had
so
far
but
thats
a
relatively
small
list
at
this
point
this
makes
me
look
forward
to
the
next
porter
that
i
can
get
my
hands
on
d
excellent
drinkability
this
is
the
porter
to
which
i
judge
all
others
it
is
what
i
think
of
as
the
benchmark
for
the
style
excellent
flavor
and
body
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
you
cant
go
wrong
with
taddy
porter
anytime
of
day
or
night
the
standard
for
an
english
porter
in
my
opinion
drinkability
drinkable
not
a
session
beer
but
drinkable
might
be
a
good
beer
to
just
have
by
itself
at
a
pub
with
friends
instead
of
with
food
verdict
delicious
and
worth
always
having
around
overall
im
a
little
underwhelmed
by
this
world
famous
porter
good
start
with
great
looks
and
solid
porter
aromas
i
feel
this
porter
is
weakened
by
the
added
metal
characteristics
from
the
well
water
used
in
brewing
i
didnt
hate
it
but
it
definitely
put
me
off
a
bit
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
of
these
will
be
drinking
it
more
in
the
future
a
really
enjoyable
porter
with
enough
character
to
stand
out
the
taddy
porter
manages
to
offer
a
great
interesting
taste
without
being
overlycomplicated
there
is
a
nice
down
to
earth
feel
about
this
porter
definitely
something
i
will
come
back
to
and
probably
my
new
standard
for
porters
this
mouthfeel
as
well
as
flavor
gives
this
porter
an
unusual
drinkability
for
its
style
samuel
smiths
taddy
porter
has
a
very
dark
red
colour
it
has
a
good
head
initially
and
maintains
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
of
roasty
malt
and
coffee
this
beer
has
a
very
malty
flavour
with
a
little
hops
in
there
for
balance
it
has
a
delicious
malty
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
foamy
big
feel
to
it
and
is
extremely
drinkable
body
is
medium
with
high
drinkability
complexity
is
minimal
but
its
a
pretty
great
porter
a
little
thinner
than
i
think
i
remembered
but
one
of
the
better
english
breweries
at
it
again
seek
it
out
im
shocked
never
to
have
reviewed
taddy
it
was
a
goto
when
i
didnt
have
access
to
a
great
fridge
d
slosh
em
down
drinkability
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
could
be
a
little
less
heavy
in
the
stomach
though
drinkability
certainly
one
of
the
best
porters
in
the
business
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
representative
of
the
style
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
not
much
lacing
to
be
found
nose
is
overloaded
with
toffee
and
has
some
roasted
malt
coffee
and
light
chocolate
in
the
background
the
taste
really
brings
the
toffee
and
caramel
forward
without
regard
to
the
better
roasted
characteristics
that
are
in
the
background
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
not
the
best
balance
of
flavors
all
in
all
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
as
i
am
with
most
of
sammy
smiths
beers
another
beer
that
exudes
quality
from
a
brewery
that
has
been
solid
since
the
olden
days
drinkability
is
high
on
this
bad
boy
getchu
some
if
ya
see
it
around
d
review
the
above
statements
wonderful
beer
drink
well
my
friends
wonderful
mouthfeel
balanced
flavors
and
very
easydrinking
notes
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
sheer
ecstasy
for
the
palate
the
finish
is
a
touch
short
and
sweet
along
with
some
mild
lingering
roast
besides
that
the
beer
is
perfect
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
creamy
with
perfect
mild
carbonation
the
medium
body
feels
great
and
keeps
me
wanting
more
this
was
a
great
pairing
with
a
lobster
bisque
and
samuel
really
enjoyed
sharing
his
affinity
for
this
beer
the
young
man
will
be
leading
the
company
soon
and
hes
ready
to
embrace
their
heritage
starting
with
his
love
for
taddy
porter
drinkability
tastes
much
more
complex
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
smooth
with
a
hearty
flavor
a
nice
porter
that
will
be
an
excellent
three
season
beer
very
drinkable
though
lets
not
forget
that
the
milder
something
is
the
more
one
can
just
chug
it
down
this
is
session
potent
flavor
without
potent
abv
i
wish
guinness
tasted
like
this
dthis
is
about
as
sessionable
as
a
porter
can
be
this
is
quite
good
and
one
of
my
favorite
samuel
smiths
beers
purchased
a
bottle
last
night
for
3
50
at
the
local
store
served
at
dinner
during
the
cheese
course
where
it
was
was
paired
with
an
irish
cheddar
made
with
porter
poured
into
stemmed
glasses
dark
brown
color
nice
white
head
with
good
lacing
the
nose
was
a
nice
combination
of
chocolate
and
milky
coffee
taste
was
excellent
really
rich
malt
flavor
up
front
with
a
bittersweet
chocolate
flavor
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
was
also
memorable
as
it
had
a
sturdy
body
to
it
but
was
smooth
and
the
abv
was
low
enough
to
not
be
a
factor
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
this
porter
may
not
be
the
most
flavorful
beer
i
have
ever
tried
but
it
really
seems
to
be
one
of
the
most
authentic
versions
of
a
porter
on
the
market
the
word
famous
is
used
in
the
title
for
a
reason
and
its
well
deserved
really
enjoyed
this
one
will
be
keeping
a
few
as
my
stock
porter
poured
from
bottle
into
ikea
beer
mug
incredibly
opaque
brown
color
with
a
lightbrown
head
it
even
looks
delicious
hint
of
a
creamy
type
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
starts
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
which
is
quickly
replaced
by
a
lucious
creamy
coffeechocolate
taste
very
flavorful
silky
on
the
mouth
and
leaves
a
nice
oily
coat
feel
i
love
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
a
great
porter
that
i
will
definitely
return
to
i
must
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
porter
i
have
had
drinkability
a
nice
and
rich
porter
that
is
layered
nicely
good
for
the
style
this
did
not
blow
me
away
like
i
have
been
by
other
samuel
smith
offerings
could
have
a
couple
but
would
buy
others
first
another
perfect
beer
from
samuel
smith
if
you
are
looking
for
a
english
brown
with
more
body
texture
and
abv
this
is
it
d
a
solid
beer
and
good
example
of
porters
and
stouts
in
general
would
get
this
anytime
d
an
awesome
porter
one
of
my
favorites
todate
this
beer
is
exceptional
i
absolutely
love
it
looks
good
tan
appearance
smells
good
taste
kinda
creamy
but
in
a
very
good
way
the
mouthful
is
exceptional
and
the
drinkabilty
is
great
with
one
taste
this
beer
will
have
you
coming
back
for
more
and
more
the
only
hinderance
i
see
in
this
beer
and
others
made
by
this
company
is
its
price
4
49
for
a
bottle
a
bit
pricey
but
otherwise
worth
its
value
i
found
this
a
more
enjoyable
brew
than
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
will
definitely
be
comparing
and
contrasting
this
to
some
future
porters
d
i
could
drink
these
all
day
even
on
a
90
degree
day
flavorful
and
extremely
drinkable
the
classic
modern
brown
porter
lives
up
to
the
hype
for
anyone
confused
over
the
difference
between
a
stout
and
a
porter
i
suggest
you
take
a
sip
of
the
tadcaster
drinkability
easy
drinker
if
you
like
english
porters
all
in
all
a
good
execution
like
most
sam
smiths
i
think
they
are
steeped
in
tradition
and
it
comes
through
good
beer
just
nothing
to
make
me
go
wow
im
guessing
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
compared
to
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
this
is
just
way
off
flavor
and
aroma
are
minimal
rather
fruity
with
some
portery
malts
but
overall
a
strange
salty
d
given
i
didnt
have
a
bottle
where
the
carbonation
was
off
i
think
the
drinkability
here
would
be
great
its
a
tasty
beer
just
wish
it
wasnt
as
flat
as
ten
day
old
stale
coke
off
to
buy
a
fresh
bottle
drinkability
excellent
brown
porter
that
shows
how
good
a
beer
can
be
while
still
being
low
in
alcohol
and
fairly
restrained
definitely
a
great
porter
what
i
like
is
that
it
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
mouth
with
roasted
malts
and
that
its
so
smooth
im
a
fan
poured
a
near
black
with
an
ruby
outline
when
held
to
the
light
nice
two
finger
tan
head
that
stuck
around
nose
was
appetizing
with
a
strong
roasted
character
with
subtle
chocolate
and
cherry
notes
palate
is
a
dry
sweet
and
roasted
melody
quite
delicious
not
as
sweet
as
the
alot
of
porters
and
i
love
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
more
fluid
than
id
expect
but
still
has
a
good
presence
awesome
porter
that
is
nearly
flawless
it
poured
a
very
black
substance
with
just
a
hint
of
brown
showing
at
the
edges
of
my
perfect
pour
glass
with
significant
carbonation
making
two
fingers
of
tan
head
the
aroma
had
definite
caramel
and
some
cocoa
with
maybe
a
tad
of
liquorish
taste
wise
it
seemed
just
a
smidgen
sour
or
maybe
just
a
bit
dry
it
finished
with
a
sweetness
i
wish
was
more
present
in
the
flavor
its
nice
but
i
know
several
porters
that
appeal
to
me
better
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
go
in
the
woods
build
a
fire
cook
a
nice
meal
and
sit
and
eat
and
drink
i
really
like
this
one
a
very
straightforward
beer
a
quality
of
earth
molasses
mostly
with
a
finish
of
grape
palate
is
earthy
bitter
molasses
toasty
with
a
finish
of
fig
and
grape
very
mild
sweet
sheltered
in
earth
a
lingering
mild
quality
of
vanilla
like
in
wine
very
soft
but
not
as
defined
as
in
a
good
foreign
export
great
beer
with
a
nice
smokey
quality
at
times
some
bitterness
that
works
that
way
sometimes
smokey
sometimes
bitter
chocolate
sometimes
tobacco
great
if
you
get
all
three
in
a
good
bottle
but
respectfully
mild
d
if
you
like
the
first
whiff
or
the
first
sip
youll
want
to
drink
it
in
quantities
this
is
a
greatly
drinkable
brew
lots
of
stuff
going
on
yet
not
overwhelming
in
any
sense
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
no
freshness
date
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
fluffy
light
brown
head
that
doesnt
want
to
drop
down
into
the
glass
there
is
also
lots
of
carbonation
with
this
one
lots
of
roasted
malts
in
the
smell
very
roasty
taste
too
dark
chocolate
with
some
dark
roasted
coffee
beans
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
that
starts
off
chewy
and
finishes
with
a
crisp
bitterness
from
the
roasted
malts
a
very
lovely
porter
that
is
wonderful
to
drink
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
porter
and
one
that
i
would
strongly
recommend
to
any
beer
drinker
possibly
the
best
porter
ive
had
i
could
drink
this
every
day
an
excellent
porter
it
pours
black
into
the
glass
with
a
good
roasted
malt
aroma
with
faint
hops
the
taste
is
smooth
and
velvety
based
on
alton
browns
recent
good
eats
episode
on
porterhouse
steaks
i
figured
i
try
out
the
pairingit
worked
perfectly
the
mouthfeel
is
also
impressive
the
fine
bubbles
and
foam
taste
like
nitro
and
while
porters
can
be
on
the
heavy
side
this
was
exceptionally
drinkable
the
5
abv
helps
this
is
an
excellent
delicious
porter
this
is
a
beer
to
judge
other
beers
by
flavor
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
brown
porter
style
fruits
cocoa
little
bit
of
roasty
bitterness
finishes
closer
to
dry
than
i
expected
and
with
the
creamy
body
and
soft
carbonation
and
balance
everywhere
it
is
nearly
the
epitome
of
the
style
and
ridiculously
drinkable
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
finish
is
creamy
and
the
finish
lingers
filled
with
coffee
and
cocoa
drinkability
is
insanely
good
the
texture
and
the
consistency
lend
themselves
to
an
easy
drinking
porter
that
certainly
lives
up
to
my
high
expectations
sam
smith
backs
up
its
talk
with
a
great
brew
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
an
english
porter
very
good
pours
to
a
clear
very
dark
brown
ruby
black
color
and
thick
tan
head
aroma
is
caramel
malts
coffee
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
maple
flavor
is
roasty
malt
coffee
sweet
malt
and
some
balancing
hop
resin
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
overall
an
exceptionally
well
made
and
technically
accurate
porter
as
you
would
expect
dark
brown
opaque
body
1
finger
light
tan
head
with
a
bit
of
uneven
rockiness
the
nose
is
chocolate
balanced
by
oak
notes
the
chocolate
becomes
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
up
the
taste
is
pretty
complex
a
bit
of
coffee
hints
of
chocolate
with
good
oak
character
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
not
too
sticky
with
good
effervescence
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
one
smooth
beer
while
perhaps
not
as
robust
as
other
american
porters
this
is
one
damn
fine
beer
i
do
think
strongly
flavoured
food
will
drown
out
a
lot
of
the
flavor
of
this
beer
as
i
experienced
as
perhaps
the
flavor
is
a
bit
subtle
but
thats
hardly
a
bad
thing
and
is
to
be
expected
for
the
style
and
alcohol
content
make
sure
you
let
it
warm
for
a
bit
before
drinking
a
nice
beer
overall
d
very
high
its
extremely
enjoyable
and
worthy
of
the
praise
it
gets
sam
smith
does
it
again
every
thing
they
offer
is
just
about
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
this
is
history
in
a
glass
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
easy
drinking
and
fairly
flavorful
making
it
a
good
choice
for
a
session
porter
its
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
d
it
is
5
so
being
a
bit
thin
is
understandable
yet
well
hidden
highly
drinkable
and
a
great
pairing
with
a
chocolate
cake
or
a
big
rich
stew
could
also
be
a
great
night
cap
beer
if
you
want
one
good
beer
lacks
the
warming
sensation
from
a
higher
abv
but
in
a
lot
of
ways
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
food
best
part
is
can
have
2
and
not
get
tired
of
it
it
is
not
perfect
but
it
hides
its
imperfections
very
well
d
this
is
an
excellent
porter
a
textbook
example
for
a
reason
it
manages
a
diverse
deep
flavor
alongside
an
extremely
sessionable
body
not
such
a
hyped
style
but
anyone
could
enjoy
this
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
and
a
half
of
tan
head
it
is
dark
brown
in
color
the
smell
is
bakers
cocoa
and
some
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
milk
chocolate
and
some
black
roasted
coffee
to
finish
this
is
a
really
nice
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
could
be
more
viscous
but
then
again
i
like
chewing
my
beer
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
can
see
why
its
famous
o
high
drinkability
delicious
porter
highly
recommended
m
light
bodied
and
leaves
the
pallet
clean
a
really
dark
chestnut
brown
with
ruby
highlights
under
about
three
inches
of
light
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
thin
covering
lots
of
sweet
chocolate
in
the
nose
then
there
are
some
pretty
subtle
coffee
and
cherry
scents
chocolate
is
the
main
flavor
as
well
along
with
some
dried
fruit
figs
dates
theres
also
coffee
as
well
as
the
slightest
hint
of
smokiness
right
as
you
swallow
there
is
a
touch
of
sour
that
hits
all
the
way
to
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
a
porter
that
id
actually
enjoy
sessioning
d
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
sessionable
it
retains
its
complexity
but
doesnt
push
into
sensory
extremes
the
quintessential
porter
overall
not
a
bad
porter
but
i
prefer
a
slightly
more
robust
flavor
and
body
strong
flavor
in
this
beer
with
toasted
malt
caramel
coffee
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
that
balances
it
well
not
the
slightest
bit
of
sweetness
but
there
is
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
similar
to
coffee
full
bodied
and
very
heavy
in
the
mouth
not
for
a
warm
day
but
overall
a
really
enjoyable
drink
samuel
smiths
famouns
taddy
porter
is
pretty
good
solid
beer
overall
beer
is
medium
in
body
some
roast
comes
up
at
the
end
almost
as
an
after
taste
the
bitterness
lingers
not
much
carbonation
on
the
palate
overall
the
flavors
are
a
little
weak
i
think
its
a
good
beer
a
drinkable
beer
but
im
generally
bored
notes
a
good
example
of
an
english
porter
this
brew
is
a
bit
more
astringentsour
than
other
dark
beers
so
if
you
dont
like
astringency
in
a
beer
than
this
might
not
be
the
brew
for
you
personally
though
i
love
it
semisweet
chocolate
chips
and
strawberries
coated
with
oldschool
eraser
dust
are
the
main
flavors
i
am
getting
a
twinge
of
tartness
here
and
a
hint
of
sourness
over
there
give
it
a
pretty
authentic
british
porter
feel
very
smooth
and
velvety
mouthfeel
it
keeps
you
wanting
another
sip
each
and
every
time
there
is
enough
roasty
malt
to
give
a
mild
coffee
flavor
to
the
beer
sweetness
is
kept
pretty
low
on
the
beer
and
has
a
pretty
dry
finish
that
whispers
yea
there
are
some
hops
in
here
at
first
sniff
i
did
not
think
i
would
like
this
beer
but
the
sum
of
the
parts
is
greater
than
ugh
something
or
other
just
drink
the
damn
beer
its
pretty
freaking
tasty
samuel
smiths
taddy
porter
is
as
good
as
other
samuel
smith
beers
ive
had
it
is
a
relatively
dark
beer
the
smell
might
be
the
best
part
about
this
beer
the
smell
is
very
rich
and
somewhat
roasted
the
flavor
isnt
overbearing
in
this
beer
but
it
is
good
there
is
just
a
slight
aftertaste
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
is
the
case
with
most
samuel
smith
beers
mouthfeel
is
light
quite
drinkable
nice
beer
f
semi
bitter
on
the
finish
with
the
roasty
bitterness
dries
off
a
little
but
its
not
too
sweet
on
the
finish
either
its
more
creamy
too
with
lingering
lactose
finish
some
of
the
roasty
coffee
bean
flavor
also
sticks
around
on
the
finish
adding
to
the
bitterness
i
get
a
hint
of
raisin
and
brown
sugar
as
well
late
on
the
finish
the
bitterness
seems
to
get
a
little
overwhelming
for
what
it
should
be
at
least
or
perhaps
im
too
in
love
with
how
luscious
and
creamy
the
oatmeal
stout
is
d
its
a
nice
beer
not
much
of
a
porter
fan
but
its
a
good
solid
beer
for
drinking
on
a
beautiful
evening
its
real
easy
to
drink
as
well
quite
enjoyable
and
very
very
drinkable
definitely
in
the
top
three
for
the
style
imo
if
youve
ever
wanted
to
know
what
a
porter
should
taste
like
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
start
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
prefer
stronger
tasting
porters
but
if
your
not
a
big
dark
beer
drinker
this
is
a
good
option
to
ease
into
it
d
approaching
the
stout
style
to
me
because
of
its
rich
flavor
profile
simple
but
well
made
and
i
love
the
prices
of
samuel
smiths
brews
just
a
solid
example
in
my
opinion
nothing
outstanding
but
extremely
delicious
worth
trying
and
id
buy
it
again
for
sure
cheers
this
beer
pours
out
a
thick
black
leaving
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
main
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
with
almost
a
faint
sweetness
as
the
main
smell
fades
this
beer
has
a
strong
roasted
malt
flavor
but
with
surprisingly
little
bitterness
leaving
you
with
an
almost
creamy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
while
this
beer
is
thick
it
doesnt
feel
too
heavy
this
could
definitely
be
a
session
beer
for
me
overall
samuel
smiths
are
truly
the
masters
of
dark
english
style
ales
drinkability

a
great
beer
definitely
one
that
can
go
down
quick
and
smooth
at
5
abv
wouldnt
get
you
in
trouble
either
d
i
think
ill
have
another
enough
said
a
true
go
to
for
this
style
dthis
is
quite
good
and
only
improves
as
it
warms
the
smokiness
mellows
and
the
sweetness
enhances
smooth
and
velvety
on
tha
palate
definitely
a
tasty
brew
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
sweet
malty
aroma
with
some
chocolate
and
light
smoke
flavor
is
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
licorice
mediumthin
body
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
another
great
beer
from
samuel
smith
pours
a
clear
and
light
brown
color
with
a
light
and
lacy
tan
head
a
light
sweet
malt
aroma
is
pushed
out
of
the
glass
by
the
visible
mild
carbonation
levels
the
drink
is
light
and
flows
well
with
the
toffee
malt
flavor
smooth
and
refreshing
to
drink
it
is
well
balanced
and
finishes
quick
and
clean
great
example
of
an
english
style
and
great
for
the
warmer
parts
of
spring
and
fall
verdict
taddy
is
an
easy
and
straightforward
porter
thats
great
for
when
youre
looking
for
something
that
is
easy
to
drink
without
being
boring
sure
you
could
argue
the
intensity
could
stand
to
be
notched
up
but
this
stands
well
as
it
is
great
beer
at
5
its
hard
not
to
say
ill
have
another
more
times
than
one
should
or
could
notes
very
nice
porter
with
balanced
and
nice
flavors
not
too
bitter
and
not
too
sweet
smooth
and
nice
body
but
i
would
like
it
to
be
a
bit
fuller
taste
is
oil
alcohol
brown
ale
and
water
no
hop
quality
like
a
mead
from
england
mouthfeel
is
like
a
walnut
mixed
in
with
the
aforementioned
taste
drinkability
is
lame
as
its
about
5
per
500
ml
and
its
just
not
enjoyable
not
my
thing
d
superior
drinkability
i
could
session
these
or
i
could
have
one
and
done
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
porter
this
is
done
right
oh
so
good
d
higher
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
could
easily
be
the
soul
beer
you
have
all
evening
would
be
great
during
a
card
game
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
d
with
all
the
hype
behind
this
i
am
very
disappointed
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
all
in
all
a
solid
workaday
porter
and
one
that
i
like
a
lot
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
i
would
buy
it
agian
for
sure
i
cannot
believe
i
have
never
reviewed
this
beer
before
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
that
got
me
in
to
craft
brewing
i
poured
this
in
to
a
standard
english
pint
glass
color
is
chestnut
brown
with
a
tall
white
head
to
cap
things
off
deep
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
dominate
the
smell
with
some
charcoal
thrown
in
to
the
mix
as
well
taste
is
full
of
chocolate
and
more
dark
fruit
it
also
gets
a
bit
metallic
at
times
which
strangely
enough
really
works
for
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
drinks
as
easily
as
any
beer
i
have
ever
come
across
this
beer
reminds
me
of
why
i
first
fell
in
love
with
traditional
english
porters
i
think
sometimes
english
ales
get
a
bad
rap
for
being
too
mild
but
this
brew
proves
that
notion
wrong
indeed
this
beer
could
stand
up
to
any
american
porter
or
baltic
porter
easily
cheers
cheers
cheers
malt
sweetness
up
front
dates
and
prunes
the
savoury
middle
reminds
me
of
crispy
roast
potatos
with
gravy
medium
full
body
medium
low
carbonation
scary
high
drinkability
halfway
through
this
review
ive
poured
another
just
to
check
yep
its
good
overall
a
great
porter
and
one
that
had
been
overlooked
too
long
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
overall
one
of
the
most
unique
tasting
beers
i
have
reviewed
to
date
it
is
definitly
something
that
you
really
have
to
try
for
yourself
to
fully
appreciate
d
very
drinkable
i
think
it
would
suprise
people
who
feel
porters
and
stouts
are
too
bold
and
heavy
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
ill
certainly
be
seeking
it
out
again
to
share
with
friends
d
not
my
style
but
as
with
all
sam
smith
brews
its
of
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
its
surprisingly
big
for
5
but
an
easy
session
beer
d
while
fullers
is
the
star
of
this
style
for
me
sam
smiths
version
is
excellent
and
much
more
widely
available
i
can
get
this
anytime
at
the
corner
liquor
store
whenever
i
want
a
good
and
tasty
traditional
english
ale
poured
black
with
some
deep
ruby
in
the
light
2
finger
fluffy
cream
tan
head
looks
delicious
i
didnt
let
this
brew
warm
up
enough
maybe
as
i
wasnt
getting
nearly
anything
for
aroma
other
than
a
faint
coffee
tasted
some
faint
bitter
chocolate
and
malt
but
the
coffee
was
what
really
stood
out
to
me
with
this
guy
this
was
very
sweet
i
thought
balanced
and
some
dark
fruit
it
was
alot
lighter
than
i
guess
i
figured
it
would
be
which
is
usually
the
case
i
could
drink
motor
oil
sludge
and
still
think
its
too
light
haha
very
drinkabletastey
straight
forward
porter
though
and
if
i
was
a
coffee
drinker
which
im
not
id
much
rather
have
one
of
these
in
the
morning
with
breakfast
for
sure
and
with
only
a
good
5
abv
it
certainly
wouldnt
be
a
problem
after
my
initial
review
i
started
eating
something
salty
while
drinking
this
it
seemed
to
really
enhance
the
flavors
of
both
reminded
me
of
a
beer
you
would
drinking
in
a
cabin
or
lodge
on
a
cold
winter
night
great
beer
buy
it
the
taddy
porter
pours
a
deep
ebony
color
with
a
tan
creamy
head
that
sits
atop
the
nose
is
sweet
malts
up
front
with
a
coffee
finish
smell
is
not
overpowering
but
solid
the
palate
is
extremely
smooth
with
toffee
coffee
and
a
bitter
maltiness
that
rounds
out
the
quaff
the
flavor
profile
differs
in
bitternesssweetness
with
every
sip
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
in
my
opinion
the
alcohol
content
is
not
too
much
while
the
taste
is
a
great
sample
of
this
style
im
going
to
look
into
picking
up
some
of
this
stuff
in
the
future
and
investigating
this
style
more
thoroughly
d
goes
down
super
smooth
and
packed
with
fantastic
aroma
and
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
the
only
thing
that
keep
this
from
being
a
regular
session
beer
in
my
fridge
is
the
price
another
outstanding
samuel
smith
beer
drinkability
i
think
now
that
ive
had
this
standard
of
a
english
porter
i
prefer
american
porters
but
this
one
goes
perfectly
with
a
meal
and
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
another
one
if
it
was
available
but
i
dont
see
this
as
an
all
the
time
great
beer
for
me
its
a
nice
treat
with
a
hearty
meal
i
will
say
though
that
ive
learned
from
this
beer
that
it
has
to
warm
all
the
way
up
to
really
properly
enjoy
it
no
wonder
the
brits
like
their
beer
warm
at
least
this
one
is
best
that
way
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
am
just
mad
that
i
havent
sampled
it
before
now
a
classic
the
quintessential
real
porter
if
you
want
to
drink
a
porter
get
a
sam
smith
famous
taddy
wow
highly
recommended
d
this
beer
is
not
too
strong
in
flavor
or
odor
but
it
has
a
good
complex
flavor
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
d
simple
good
porter
so
simple
to
drink
overall
a
classic
tasty
porter
that
is
easily
sesssionable
a
classic
example
of
the
style
a
pleasantly
silky
supple
and
tasty
winter
sipper
let
it
sit
first
for
a
spell
if
it
is
straight
out
of
the
fridge
though
the
flavours
seem
to
open
up
even
more
as
it
warms
another
paragon
for
the
style
in
question
from
this
brewer
they
hit
all
the
right
buttons
for
their
homelands
native
brews
this
much
is
certain
code
sf2311
of
unknown
meaning
note
aftertaste
is
coffeelike
but
not
the
unpleasant
taste
from
after
drinking
actual
coffee
similar
to
cocoa
coated
coffee
beans
t
its
very
tart
very
dry
the
portwine
taste
is
slight
no
hopes
that
i
can
tell
quality
but
not
my
style
if
you
like
porters
this
is
a
must
try
i
dare
say
this
porter
might
be
over
carbonated
im
into
a
heavier
porter
really
certainly
drinkable
though
cheers
overall
a
delicious
porter
that
is
definitely
worth
giving
a
shot
if
you
see
this
one
around
fabulously
creamy
though
and
quite
drinkable
at
5
d
light
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
decent
representation
of
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
notes
now
i
know
what
all
of
the
fuss
is
about
this
is
a
good
porter
i
could
seriously
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
it
is
that
good
probably
the
best
porter
ive
had
so
far
it
puts
a
lot
of
others
to
shame
pours
an
opaque
blackbrown
color
with
a
tancream
colored
head
leaving
medium
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
yeast
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
very
pleasant
taste
begins
with
a
nice
mellow
roasted
malt
sweet
and
then
a
bit
tangy
in
the
middle
with
a
dark
chocolate
finish
body
is
medium
and
smooth
overall
another
solid
offering
from
samuel
smiths
of
which
i
could
easily
have
several
d
i
could
sit
at
a
pub
and
drink
this
all
night
long
quintessential
english
session
beer
d
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
comparable
to
their
oatmeal
stout
with
the
same
body
but
with
more
of
a
chocolatiness
that
i
prefer
all
in
all
a
bit
onesided
consistent
though
and
pretty
damn
good
overall
this
one
of
the
finest
porters
ive
ever
had
second
only
perhaps
to
new
glarus
olde
english
d
a
great
drinking
modern
english
porter
sessionable
to
be
sure
poured
from
the
gold
foil
topped
bottle
to
my
favorite
snifter
black
appearance
with
a
nice
two
finger
tan
head
malty
toasty
smell
and
coffee
roasted
flavor
i
liked
reading
a
previous
poster
say
campfire
which
is
the
word
i
was
looking
for
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
was
medium
light
carbonation
dangerously
easy
drinking
drinkability
is
hard
to
fault
like
many
english
beers
i
could
put
away
far
too
many
of
these
without
really
worrying
about
it
carbonation
is
quite
prickly
something
i
dont
like
in
porters
and
stouts
decent
beer
despite
my
first
bottle
being
ruined
it
is
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
after
i
drank
about
half
the
bottle
i
finished
the
rest
while
eating
some
good
ham
i
found
the
combo
quite
delicious
so
easy
to
drink
i
sought
a
hearty
porter
and
while
this
wasnt
it
taddy
porter
was
a
great
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
balanced
flavors
with
no
overpowering
aftertaste
could
have
one
after
another
mostly
opaque
but
clear
dark
brown
color
with
rub
highlights
with
a
thick
creamy
light
tan
head
that
has
little
retention
or
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
and
creamy
prominently
features
milk
chocolate
cocoa
roast
malt
notes
but
overall
mild
medium
bodied
with
smooth
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
bitter
cloying
aftertaste
that
ends
quickly
and
is
slightly
watery
flavor
is
pleasant
balance
of
chocolatemalt
sweetness
and
mild
dark
fruit
bitterness
but
overall
the
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
and
short
finish
detracts
from
the
fullness
of
the
flavor
i
dont
know
i
hoped
for
more
from
this
not
a
bad
porter
but
not
exceptional
like
anticipated
a
very
heady
beer
just
like
that
oatmeal
stout
i
just
had
the
head
is
a
great
colour
like
a
beige
or
desert
tan
maybe
a
light
chocolate
milk
colour
it
is
incredibly
creamy
and
delicious
the
body
is
a
deep
ruby
brown
and
lets
light
barely
through
the
middle
the
nose
is
fine
for
a
porter
could
have
more
coffee
and
malts
and
could
be
stronger
the
taste
however
is
exceptional
deep
dark
roasted
malts
traces
of
coffee
and
caramel
a
touch
of
what
i
would
call
booze
something
slightly
sharp
and
a
miniscule
tinge
of
sour
the
feel
is
quite
thin
even
with
the
big
carbonation
but
this
however
coupled
with
the
taste
makes
the
brew
incredibly
drinkable
and
a
great
session
beer
a
good
beer
but
why
do
i
always
feel
let
down
by
porters
its
probably
that
i
just
dont
understand
them
properly
i
suppose
this
clean
and
easy
drinking
beer
was
the
perfect
thing
for
my
heartburn
the
other
night
this
was
an
old
time
go
to
before
i
was
even
really
into
craft
beer
and
it
had
been
way
too
long
since
i
tried
it
i
remember
drinking
this
out
of
the
bottle
in
a
brown
bag
while
walking
around
san
francisco
when
i
was
21
and
loving
it
now
that
i
know
enough
to
give
this
inconic
brew
proper
respect
i
enjoy
it
even
more
a
good
brew
for
sure
i
wish
sam
smith
was
available
in
6
packs
also
at
the
risk
of
sounding
like
a
broken
record
if
you
liked
this
try
the
imperial
stout
or
vice
versa
freakin
nice
poured
from
a
550
ml
bottle
to
my
favorite
old
bass
dimpled
made
in
england
mug
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
taupe
head
and
good
lacing
light
aroma
of
chocolate
and
coffee
nothing
too
strong
though
taste
is
wonderful
mostly
of
bitter
chocolate
with
some
coffee
feels
smooth
and
clean
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
drinkability
is
fantastic
i
could
drink
this
all
night
without
a
problem
samuel
smiths
taddy
porter
was
the
first
porter
i
ever
tried
and
i
am
finding
it
hard
to
beat
the
overall
sensation
this
beer
gives
off
reminds
me
of
sss
oatmeal
stout
you
can
definitely
tell
the
two
beers
are
siblings
550
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
thick
dark
and
creamy
with
a
solid
inch
of
tan
head
the
smell
mostly
reminds
me
of
semisweet
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
the
dark
chocolate
as
well
but
is
hindered
by
a
strong
metallic
aftertaste
still
a
pretty
mellow
and
smooth
beer
with
some
other
hints
of
vanilla
and
nuttiness
mouthfeel
is
creamy
perfect
for
this
style
excellent
drinkability
for
a
stout
d
well
this
is
absolutely
drinkable
by
nearly
everyone
who
likes
beer
may
very
well
be
the
best
porter
i
have
had
to
date
d
another
great
natural
samuel
smith
great
taste
without
adding
chocolate
or
coffee
with
sam
smith
they
come
naturally
and
in
perfect
balance
could
really
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
sadly
had
to
move
on
d
very
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
delicious
practical
and
for
under
3
dollars
a
bomber
ill
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
bubbly
tanned
head
that
receeds
slowly
leaving
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
evident
with
a
strangely
similar
aura
about
it
just
reminding
me
of
other
sammy
smith
products
also
picking
up
on
some
light
malt
sweetness
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
just
as
good
chocolate
immediately
evident
along
the
rich
smoothness
and
ever
so
slightly
bitter
finish
very
clean
slightly
lingering
tastes
of
chocolate
and
burnt
grains
medium
feel
with
low
carb
overall
a
solid
product
that
is
very
enjoyable
d
could
definitely
put
down
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
kinda
pissed
that
i
only
got
one
for
now
this
beer
didnt
taste
bad
it
just
didnt
really
taste
like
a
porter
to
me
it
tasted
like
every
sam
smith
beer
faint
alcohol
and
a
few
other
faint
flavors
on
the
side
i
am
disappointed
all
in
all
ive
reviewed
this
beer
as
i
experienced
it
from
reading
the
other
reviews
mine
seems
to
differ
a
bit
and
i
wonder
if
there
wasnt
some
other
variable
at
play
maybe
ill
give
it
another
shot
in
the
future
but
for
now
this
is
as
i
experienced
it
all
in
all
a
fairly
solid
beer
but
not
really
thrilled
in
the
least
d
seemed
the
more
i
drank
of
this
one
the
more
i
wished
it
was
a
bottomless
glass
sam
smith
got
it
right
with
this
one
overall
this
beer
way
overcompensated
for
its
faults
with
its
taste
and
mouth
feel
i
was
immediately
sad
that
i
only
had
one
of
these
lying
around
and
will
need
to
go
get
another
one
at
some
point
drinkability
like
everything
else
that
samuel
smiths
produce
this
is
truly
magnificent
a
really
classic
porter
they
way
they
are
meant
to
be
ma
creamy
almost
syrupy
medium
mouthfeel
and
at
the
very
very
end
it
turns
dry
so
very
nice
the
mouth
is
extremely
creamy
and
smooth
this
is
like
silk
going
down
very
pleasant
decent
chocolate
flavors
mix
with
a
subtle
sweet
creaminess
that
make
this
a
very
drinkable
dark
brew
some
roasted
nuttiness
finishes
this
one
out
i
really
like
this
and
i
could
drink
a
few
at
a
time
well
done
an
absolutely
delightful
beer
almost
without
question
the
best
porter
ive
ever
sampled
it
now
sets
the
bar
for
all
others
although
id
be
more
than
happy
to
just
drink
this
one
from
now
on
d
much
better
at
warmer
temperatures
very
tasty
drinkability
at
5
there
is
no
alcohol
burn
and
the
beer
is
so
well
balanced
that
i
could
have
another
sitting
here
though
i
am
rather
full
and
still
have
14
of
the
beer
remaining
for
me
one
is
great
enough
ill
drink
more
of
this
someday
it
wont
be
my
goto
porter
but
it
will
be
considered
when
my
black
boss
isnt
available
very
drinkable
for
a
porter
absolutely
delicious
conclusion
outstanding
beer
for
the
cool
autumn
and
bitter
cold
winters
in
chicago
the
flavors
are
complex
and
obvious
without
being
over
the
top
highly
recommend
it
to
my
friends
drinkability
is
probably
the
least
excellent
point
of
this
beer
only
because
it
is
like
drinking
a
meal
it
is
a
filling
brew
and
it
isnt
the
beer
to
turn
to
for
instant
refreshment
on
a
hot
day
yes
i
realize
it
is
a
porter
definitely
a
sipper
for
a
cool
evening
in
fall
all
around
just
a
great
porter
its
not
perfect
but
it
almost
feels
like
it
since
it
can
be
found
almost
everywhere
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
cherry
colour
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
leaves
a
nice
frothy
two
finger
cappicino
laced
head
with
decent
lacing
down
the
glassit
has
aromas
of
woodycoffee
laced
cherries
and
a
subtle
coffee
aroma
in
the
backgroundit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
which
starts
off
with
a
medium
body
yet
finishes
very
light
like
water
that
fills
the
palette
with
tastes
of
blackberries
and
cherries
laced
in
coffee
liqueorthis
is
definately
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
because
of
the
light
finish
drinkability
is
high
as
usual
sam
smith
sets
the
bar
the
standard
for
the
style
removing
the
wrap
from
the
lid
on
one
of
samuel
smiths
taddy
porters
ensures
a
pleasant
classic
night
of
roasted
english
dark
ale
tasty
and
robust
with
its
slightly
smoky
light
nutty
flavor
its
an
easily
irresistible
porter
out
there
that
almost
begs
the
drinker
to
swallow
more
good
porter
drinkability
its
a
little
thick
to
swill
pint
after
pint
of
it
but
a
few
of
these
in
a
long
session
would
be
quite
nice
btw
i
have
found
that
the
bigger
bottles
fatty
taddy
as
they
are
known
is
the
way
to
go
with
this
beer
unlike
some
of
the
other
sam
smith
products
i
e
winter
welcome
and
nut
brown
ale
etc
this
one
you
dont
want
too
cold
and
the
bigger
bottle
means
it
has
more
time
to
open
up
and
come
down
to
near
room
temperature
and
of
course
you
get
more
of
the
magical
brew
too

porter
cheers
d
extremely
drinkable
this
is
my
type
of
porter
i
could
tip
down
quite
a
few
of
these
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
and
a
top
example
of
the
style
may
be
the
best
porter
i
have
tried
excellent
d
very
drinkable
beer
with
nothing
to
overwhelm
the
palate
bloody
good
i
could
drink
several
of
these
on
a
cold
winters
night
be
sure
to
let
it
warm
to
about
13
degrees
as
it
is
nowhere
near
as
nice
when
cold
a
benchmark
english
porter
mfd
very
very
smooth
low
carbonation
mediumthick
body
a
truly
unique
porter
very
english
drinkability
is
good
this
is
so
light
you
could
drink
this
in
the
hot
summer
and
want
more
taddy
looks
heavy
but
is
not
it
is
a
mild
bodied
porter
that
provides
for
an
elegant
quaff
before
the
manors
fireplace
or
a
refreshing
bracer
following
a
fox
hunt
on
the

so
heres
to
catherine
and
heathcliff
whos
your
taddy
d
very
high
thanks
to
the
great
taste
mouthfeel
and
low
alcohol
content
would
make
a
great
session

but
this
really
isnt

your
typical
porter
weak
palate
meh
im
not
digging
this
d
very
drinkable
a
tip
of
the
hat
to
the
beer
philosopher
for
pointing
this
one
out
i
love
it
drinkability
im
not
an
expert
on
beers
yet
but
most
of
the
darker
beers
ive
drank
are
not
something
you
can
drink
quickly
there
slow
sipping
beers
that
demand
appreciation
this
does
too
however
its
very
smooth
and
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
alcohol
content
is
not
very
high
so
itd
be
easy
to
have
a
few
if
price
wasnt
an
issue
most
sammy
smiths
brews
are
worth
the
4
imho
a
very
solid
porter
probably
one
of
those
that
defined
the
style
poured
a
perfect

fl
oz
tried
this
with
italian
sausage
and

and
it
went
very
well
with
the
red
meat
english
beers
i
think
were
meant
to
be
drunk
at
room
temperature
not
blasted
cold
in
the
fridge
like
yank
beers
d
a
great
porter
i
dont
remember
what
it
cost
me
but
if
its
under
4
or
so
its
a
phenomenal
value
pitch
black

a
small

taste

and
coffee
creamy
and

goes

very
nicely
i
think
porter
fans
should
try
at
least
once
i
know
this
is
something
i
will
buy
again
in
the
futrue
this
is
another
great
one
from
sam
smith
its
pitch
black
with
a
good
creamy

chocolate
coffee
malty

taste
and
mouthfeel
are
both
outstanding

excellent
i
could
definitely
session
this
were
i
so
inclined
tastes
very
smooth
and
thick
roasted
barley
bittersweet
chocolate
touch
of
coffee
and
a
little
bit
of
nuts
ends
dry
and
bitter
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
porters
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
pours
black
with
a
thick
beige
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
line
of
bubbles
chocolate
burnt
malt
coffee
aromas
it
has
a
sweetness
to
the
aroma
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
slight
caramel
flavors
the
thing
that
i
really
like
about
this
beer
is
that
the
carbonation
kicks
in
and
the
mouthfeel
becomes
creamy
and
smooth
just
about
the
time
the
chocolate
flavors
kick
and
that
really
enhances
the
flavor
there
is
a
very
faint
herbalfloral
note
to
it
this
is
the
way
i
like
an
english
porter
hurrah
in
general
i
prefer
american
porters
like
edmund
fitz
or
sn
to
this
this
reminds
meleans
towards
more
of
a
stout
500
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
darkest
brown
in
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
licorice
smoked
malt
and
black
coffee
flavor
is
dark
fruity
with
prune
and
grape
dark
chocolate
overtones
light
smoke
and
roasted
malts
a
little
watery
easy
to
drink
dvery
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
i
was
intrigued
to
try
this
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
stouts
and
since
the
porter
is
really
the
father
of
the
stout
i
can
easily
see
the
comparisons
in
the
roasted
notes
not
as
overpowering
as
the
stouts
i
prefer
drinking
but
still
a
well
balanced
beer
with
a
unique
and
enjoyable
blend
of
flavors
definitely
outpaces
all
other
porters
ive
tried
to
this
point
albeit
they
were
of
the
american
variety
sa
honey
porter
left
hand
blackjack
porter
not
the
proper
english
style
notes
ive
enjoyed
this
one
for
quite
awhile
but
this
is
the
first
time
reviewing
it
and
well
its
not
hard
to
tell
why
this
is
considered
a
classic
i
love
the
way
that
huge
roasted
barley
taste
mixes
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
in
this
one
quite
tasty
but
cant
quite
keep
pace
with
some
of
the
better
porters
out
there
nowadays
samuel
smiths
comes
through
again
with
a
delicious
and
ridiculously
drinkable
beer
a
must
try
for
any
porter
fan
overall
really
drinkable
good
sweet
and
roasted
flavors
no
hops
noticed
at
all
the
alcohol
flavor
is
present
more
so
than
most
5
abv
beers
but
luckily
no
alcohol
burn
great
english
porter
drinkability
excellent
session
beer
a
special
treat
pours
a
black
lake
pint
with
a
cinnamon
off
white
thin
head
light
lacing
dabs
the
glass
surrounding
a
light
aroma
of
berries
and
bitter
chocolate
the
aroma
is
rather
light
making
it
difficult
to
decipher
notes
the
taste
is
bangin
exactly
what
i
expect
from
an
english
porter
refreshing
roast
tangy
zesty
blueberry
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
crisp
carbonation
with
a
light
body
one
of
the
best
sessions
i
have
come
across
something
magically
historical
lies
within
this
pint
one
to
meditate
upon
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
wont
be
part
of
my
everyday
rotation
but
mostly
just
for
the
import
pricing
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
though
d
not
to
impressed
with
the
drinkability
have
had
better
porters
could
not
get
over
the
tartness
would
not
buy
again
drinkability
so
drinkable
probably
the
best
session
beer
of
the
porter
style
i
have
had
at
least
right
up
there
great
flavor
great
complexity
and
so
drinkable
one
i
will
be
visiting
again
much
much
more
often
this
was
one
of
the
first
better
beers
i
had
tried
way
back
when
and
i
appreciate
now
even
so
much
more
then
i
did
just
a
great
great
beer
overall
pretty
eh
d
very
easydrinking
and
tasty
could
drink
this
all
night
and
would
go
very
well
with
some
chocolate
cake
or
mocha
cheesecake
d
session
porter
d
this
is
a
fantastic
porter
and
i
dont
think
sammy
smiths
can
do
any
wrong
this
porter
is
just
amazingly
sessionable
it
has
those
really
nice
porter
flavors
but
does
not
sit
as
heavy
as
some
american
porters
this
beer
shows
that
you
can
have
that
porter
flavor
and
goodness
without
a
huge
abv
and
over
the
top
sweetness
or
hopping
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
sessioned
and
enjoyed
and
everyone
should
do
just
that
god
stuff
almost
black
in
body
with
creamy
cinnamon
head
that
leaves
lacing
a
sweet
aroma
of
chocolate
cream
some
hops
and
sugar
a
tranquil
array
of
flavors
are
present
but
none
seem
to
want
to
take
the
lead
slight
roast
slight
bitter
chocolate
notes
cola
qualities
slight
hops
at
the
finish
some
burnt
grain
a
cola
like
mouthfeel
that
is
a
little
fizzy
not
quite
my
bag
baby
but
still
a
pretty
good
brew
for
fans
of
english
ales
this
is
one
to
look
out
for
550
ml
bottle
pours
dark
molasses
brown
into
a
pint
sized
pub
glass
making
a
thick
espresso
like
milky
head
that
dissipates
reluctantly
leaving
snowflake
like
lacing
smell
is
sweet
cedar
mixed
with
hersheys
chocolate
syrup
taste
is
rich
buttery
pancakes
and
cocoa
mouthfeel
reinforces
or
creates
pancake
sensation
bubbles
exist
only
to
remind
you
that
you
are
drinking
beer
drinks
smooth
and
wonderful
d
highly
drinkable
porter
low
abv
and
pleasant
taste
make
this
the
ideal
session
porter
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
very
solid
the
price
is
a
tad
high
not
intended
but
it
was
worth
it
moreys
bottom
line
ive
moved
away
from
dark
beers
over
the
past
year
but
i
must
say
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
among
the
best
porters
that
ive
tried
beer
pours
black
with
ruby
undertones
with
a
long
lasting
tan
head
nose
upon
opening
was
a
blast
of
english
hops
with
slight
roasted
coffee
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
supremely
well
balanced
with
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
sweetness
from
the
underlying
dark
fruit
and
a
well
stated
english
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
above
average
smoothness
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
deliciious
well
balanced
porter
that
is
a
must
try
of
english
porter
style
fans
bold
smooth
full
but
all
in
a
nice
package
if
i
was
offered
this
over
apres
meal
coffee
this
wins
nice
easy
for
this
style
delicious
and
definately
a
genre
spreader
d
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
unlike
many
american
takes
on
the
style
this
porter
does
not
overwhelm
the
palate
with
the
coffeetoffee
malts
its
well
balanced
and
was
quite
a
welcome
change
of
pace
an
absolutely
magnificent
session
porter
drinkability
is
decent
23
and
that
would
be
about
all
i
could
handle
for
the
night
overall
it
is
smooth
but
a
very
heavy
beer
drinkability
for
a
porter
this
one
stands
out
as
one
i
could
drink
all
night
d
probably
my
favorite
beer
so
far
could
drink
all
week
month
year
and
never
get
bored
of
it
drinkability
very
good
for
such
a
dark
porter
could
drink
a
whole
6pack
if
i
didnt
eat
dinner
taste
is
not
in
your
face
its
just
a
great
balanced
porter
creamy
coffee
with
some
chocolate
mouth
is
coated
with
sweetness
and
just
really
creamy
without
being
very
heavy
bodied
drinkability
is
just
about
as
good
as
it
gets
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
great
example
of
the
porter
style
that
should
and
likley
does
influence
others
who
make
porters
low
in
alcohol
smooth
on
the
palate
nicely
dry
and
with
a
wonderful
balance
of
british
modesty
and
fullon
flavor
this
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
and
a
delightful
sipper
porter
is
sadly
a
fairly
rare
style
having
been
taken
over
largely
by
its
stout
brethren
but
its
great
to
see
that
some
great
classic
examples
such
as
this
one
still
plough
on
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
only
bought
on
bottle
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
tried
i
could
drink
these
all
night
pours
a
dark
park
brownblack
colored
body
with
a
tannish
colored
head
huge
and
lasting
has
a
sweet
coffee
aroma
and
some
dark
chocolate
a
thin
taste
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
a
slight
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
light
tasting
as
the
beer
warms
its
character
increases
and
becomes
really
good
i
sure
did
enjoy
this
special
treat
great
slick
black
appearance
slightly
oil
looking
light
brown
colored
head
with
some
minor
lacing
on
the
sides
a
burnt
milk
chocolate
smell
was
nicely
permeating
from
the
drink
if
only
the
taste
was
equal
to
the
nice
aroma
a
little
watery
and
light
compared
to
a
dense
chocolate
taste
i
was
hoping
mouthfeel
perhaps
is
the
main
culprit
in
the
odd
taste
with
its
light
watery
texture
with
no
real
creamy
aspect
the
carbonation
is
also
a
bit
off
for
my
palate
nevertheless
the
mouthfeel
allows
it
to
be
light
enough
not
too
much
of
a
brick
in
the
stomach
overall
surprisingly
imbalanced
d
easy
drinking
with
good
balance
fine
as
a
cool
weather
beer
or
accompaniment
to
a
meal
note
i
did
have
a
90
minute
ipa
before
this
so
i
will
def
review
this
again
when
my
mouth
is
clear
now
id
just
like
to
state
that
the
criteria
for
the
beer
appearance
smell
drinkability
etc
all
matches
up
quite
well
it
is
an
all
around
good
balanced
beer
i
just
dont
think
it
is
worthy
of
an
a
rating
in
comparison
to
some
other
porters
out
there
the
taddy
porter
is
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
consider
it
to
be
a
fairly
average
porter
the
taste
is
rather
absent
considering
its
a
porter
a
very
good
porter
drinkability
is
high
would
definitely
seek
out
again
this
beer
is
really
something
special
i
am
a
big
fan
of
porters
and
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
pours
very
dark
with
very
little
head
the
nose
is
rather
surprising
all
the
dark
malts
that
one
would
expect
but
also
a
sour
tang
that
goes
delightfully
well
with
the
overall
presentation
taste
is
very
mild
exceedingly
smooth
not
too
much
roasted
coffee
here
but
the
chocolate
is
very
pronounced
towards
the
aftertaste
somewhat
lighter
beer
for
the
mouth
than
i
had
envisioned
it
but
overall
the
effect
is
great
cheers
d
an
excellent
porter
that
is
supersmooth
with
a
subdued
classic
character
as
you
can
tell
i
feel
pretty
good
about
this
beer
in
fact
it
is
my
favorite
beer
overall
ive
only
had
a
few
english
porters
but
i
really
enjoy
them
this
one
in
particular
the
fact
that
the
bitter
chocolate
and
toffee
flavors
arent
as
back
seat
as
they
are
in
american
porters
appeals
to
me
definitely
try
this
porter
tastes
like
a
malty
roast
heavy
beer
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
maybe
some
coffee
notes
beautiful
creamy
mouthfeel
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
one
eminently
drinkable
beer
thanks
again
sam
smith
d
rich
and
highly
drinkable
drier
than
expected
and
more
roasted
than
expected
but
ultimately
a
fantastic
beer
and
deserving
of
the
title
famous
i
will
have
to
drink
the
stout
to
get
a
baring
on
how
this
fits
in
the
spectrum
between
nut
brown
and
the
stout
overall
i
love
this
beer
for
a
great
fit
in
moderation
or
for
a
session
goes
good
with
or
without
food
just
great
porter
a
must
try
d
this
brew
has
a
lot
of
character
and
theres
definitely
a
nice
balance
between
the
roasted
malt
bitter
coffeechocolate
and
hops
this
is
a
very
solid
sessionable
porter
and
a
great
benchmark
for
other
attempts
at
the
style
soft
lightly
carbonated
mouthfeel
that
fits
the
beer
and
is
reminiscent
of
many
other
samuel
smith
beers
very
well
balanced
between
three
main
flavors
grassy
hops
roasted
malt
and
sweet
chocolate
straightforward
and
delicious
example
of
an
english
porter
great
introduction
to
the
style
for
the
less
experienced
beer
drinker
and
a
solid
staple
for
the
seasoned
veteran
d
we
used
to
buy
cases
of
the
big
bottles
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
seems
a
bit
metallic
tonight
but
my
taster
may
be
off
a
bit
excellent
porter
very
drinkable
but
also
very
filling
clean
very
crisp
no
problem
finishing
this
bottle
overall
an
exceptional
porter
slightly
second
in
my
opinion
only
to
entire
butt
good
drinkability
the
body
seems
a
bit
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
still
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
obviously
a
low
abv
and
the
presence
of
alcohol
isnt
really
detected
making
this
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
call
this
a
session
beer
but
it
does
make
for
a
nice
after
dinner
treat
as
the
previous
poster
noted
a
little
too
rich
for
me
to
drink
regularly
but
excellent
from
time
to
time
pours
dark
dark
almost
black
with
a
small
head
the
taste
is
sweet
with
lots
of
molasses
while
i
would
not
turn
this
down
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
it
would
not
be
my
first
pick
probably
the
best
porter
going
two
thumbs
way
up
d
very
drinkable
great
as
a
dessert
delicious
very
drinkable
due
to
the
smooth
flavor
and
rich
malty
flavors
inherent
in
a
good
porter
great
brew
worthy
of
its
famous
status
body
is
about
medium
and
a
mouthfeel
that
is
fairly
smooth
but
also
going
towards
thin
or
watery
perfectly
satisfying
anyway
you
put
it
carbonation
is
strong
and
stingy

unfortunately
since
my
initial
review
i
have
had
this
beer
in
a
four
pack
of
12oz
bottles
and
it
had
less
flavor
possibly
due
to
age
robust
good
strong
straightforward
flavor
no
strong
alcohol
to
overwhelm
complex
aroma
nice
atmosphere
a
good
quaff
to
sit
around
and
sip
or
power
through
and
get
another
whatever
does
it
for
ya
as
this
one
drinks
easily
enough
to
have
another
one
i
think
sam
smith
is
an
underachiever
every
beer
of
his
that
i
come
across
comes
close
to
greatness
but
always
falls
short
fortunately
this
beer
fals
out
of
their
normal
paradigm
very
dark
pour
with
a
ring
of
bubbles
smoky
with
slight
coffee
and
caramel
malt
aroma
that
is
carried
through
in
the
flavor
subdued
on
the
verge
of
weakness
a
great
example
of
a
classic
porter
that
avoids
spilling
into
the
stout
category
average
drinkability
im
afraid
id
probably
go
for
a
number
of
american
porters
over
this
one
this
poured
an
opaque
dark
mahogany
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
vanilla
and
milk
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
roasted
barley
it
tasted
like
subtle
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malts
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
coffee
and
oak
it
was
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
mildly
sweet
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
had
a
nice
clean
flavor
that
was
subtle
but
tasty
it
was
fuller
bodied
that
i
would
typically
expect
from
a
porter
more
like
a
stout
but
it
was
really
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
over
and
over
although
its
quite
filling
looks
like
the
the
english
win
this
bout
of
the
porters
but
i
would
give
anchor
porter
another
shot
maybe
this
bottle
i
have
here
is
a
bit
old
but
i
cant
tell
the
color
is
deep
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
aromas
of
toasted
malt
nuts
barley
coffee
chocolate
and
molasses
the
taste
is
toasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
slate
earth
barley
hops
and
a
smooth
subtle
chocolate

this
a
good
and
very
well
made

is
easy
to
drink
very
very
good

meal

winter
brew
will
definitely
revisit
this
in
the
colder
months
warms
the
belly
very
nicely
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
the
beer
is
brown
with
a
thick
finecelled
offwhite
foam
the
smell
is
roasted
malts
maybe
a
little
chocolate
with
a
clean
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
classic
porter
roasted
malts
with
a
lasting
aftertaste
of
chocolate
the
body
is
thin
but
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
like
a
cask
ale
with
extra
fizziness
very
tasty
im
liking
everything
i
try
from
samuel
smiths
a
very
hearty
beer
that
i
would
not
recommend
during
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
one
to
enjoy
late
fall
and
all
of
winter
future
outlook
superb
in
all
areas
repeat
business
an
absolute
certainty
taste
faint
chocolate
and
coffee
to
it
i
think
i
can
best
describe
this
beer
as
a
dessert
in
a
glass
this
beer
practically
defines
drinkable
to
me
great
feel
in
the
mouth
goes
down
beautifully
taste
bits
of
toffee
caramel
and
a
nice
dark
chocolate
in
the
finish
hard
to
really
put
a
finger
on
the
taste
not
that
its
unbalanced
but
with
so
much
going
on
good
roasted
flavors
peeking
around
the
corner
its
hard
to
distinguish
a
true
taste
on
this
hints
of
blackberry
in
the
malt
very
complex
yet
hard
to
disect
notes
this
is
such
a
perfect
porter
it
has
got
to
be
the
best
porter
i
have
ever
had
the
balance
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
is
heavenly
do
i
dare
give
this
art
work
all
fives
oh
yes
come
hell
or
high
water
this
gets
fives
across
the
board
cheers
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
edges
and
a
two
finger
foamy
tan
head
aroma
of
oatmeal
roasted
malts
and
hops
lots
of
oatmeal
and
roasted
malt
up
front
followed
by
chocolate
toffee
and
nut
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
a
simple
excellent
porter
with
a
delightfully
sudsy
feel
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
with
a
big
sudsy
head
that
sticks
around
and
coats
the
glass
well
the
smell
is
sweet
with
sugary
malt
and
doesnt
reach
the
same
fullness
found
in
the
taste
the
taste
is
restrained
but
complex
there
is
nice
hop
bitterness
around
the
edges
of
a
healthy
malt
backbone
there
is
a
good
deal
of
the
earthy
musty
flavor
that
marks
porters
but
it
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
with
it
the
feel
is
almost
exactly
what
i
want
out
of
a
porter
suds
build
at
the
slightest
movements
it
is
an
immensely
drinkable
beer
and
i
can
certainly
imagine
spending
a
long
evening
drinking
glasses
of
it
in
an
english
pub
ive
been
avoiding
this
beer
for
a
little
while
as
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
porters
or
sam
smiths
beers
but
the
taddy
porter
has
me
changing
my
tune
for
the
better
drinkability
low
alcohol
and
great
flavor
make
this
a
great
candidate
for
sessioning
id
love
to
sip
on
a
few
of
these
at
home
while
watching
a
hockey
game
on
tv
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
to
boot
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
i
paired
it
with
a
steak
dinner
and
then
snacked
on
some
dark
chocolate
covered
nuts
really
went
well
with
each
and
presented
its
own
excitement
on
its
own
most
impressive
is
the
flavor
and
complexity
you
pull
from
this
low
abv
i
am
not
a
huge
stoutporter
fan
but
this
has
me
grinning
two
thumbs
up
dgreat
drinkability
extremely
enjoyable
what
a
beer
with
a
very
full
flavor
yet
relatively
easy
to
drink
this
one
is
a
wonderful
deep
ruby
colour
bordering
on
black
and
the
head
was
a
frothy
dark
tan
the
nose
was
really
interesting
as
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
was
soy
sauce
which
brought
to
mind
the
pardubický
porter
however
there
were
also
light
coffee
hints
and
eventually
something
which
brought
to
mind
the
kelp
beds
on
the
beaches
back
at
home
which
i
am
assuming
was
from
the
seaweed
finings
used
in
production
the
predominant
flavour
though
was
of
caramelised
bananas
one
of
my
favourite
desserts
as
well
as
dark
chocolate
and
a
light
coffee
taste
probably
the
perfect
english
porter
i
left
some
room
for
others
as
i
have
not
had
many
of
the
style
just
proves
that
a
beer
does
not
have
to
have
huge
hops
and
high
abv
to
be
excellant
d
a
great
porter
that
can
be
enjoyed
again
and
again
never
disappointing
always
on
the
lookout
for
a
great
porter
this
one
came
highly
recommended
and
it
did
not
disappoint
deep
brown
to
black
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
bit
of
foam
on
top
rich
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
and
the
same
in
the
initial
taste
but
the
lighter
body
subtle
carbonation
and
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
balance
the
brew
beautifully
and
make
it
extremely
drinkable
well
worth
seeking
out
just
a
quality
porter
period
samuel
smiths
the
famous
taddy
porter
pours
dark
with
a
two
finger
light
brown
head
it
has
a
malty
roasted
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
this
beer
sure
does
have
a
nice
mouthfell
very
smooth
to
me
it
starts
malty
and
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
carbonation
is
right
for
the
style
seems
to
be
very
widely
available
across
the
fruited
plain
the
only
negative
for
me
is
the
somewhat
high
price
tag
d
it
didnt
take
much
to
put
this
porter
down
i
have
to
say
it
is
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
had
very
great
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
nice
complex
malt
flavors
m
and
d
smooth
and
soft
and
just
perfect
i
have
to
slow
myself
down
and
enjoy
every
extra
minute
carbonation
is
fantastic
tiny
bubbles
help
make
it
one
easy
to
drink
brew
this
is
the
beer
that
brings
me
to
the
sam
smith
pubs
i
will
definitely
get
this
one
again
4

m4
5
d
the
mouthfeel
is
consistently
smooth
even
rounded
but
has
a
refreshing
texture
thanks
to
the
tiny
yet
invisible
bubbles
in
the
black
nectar
mediumbodied
with
full
flavour
yet
staying
lowprofile
this
is
a
balanced
porter
with
some
excellent
yet
subtle
characteristics
it
takes
time
to
explore
this
beer
fully
excellent
beer
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
great
was
surprised
that
the
beer
was
in
a
clear
bottle
as
from
looking
at
it
the
beer
made
the
bottle
look
like
the
standard
brown
bottle
the
foil
was
a
pain
to
try
and
peel
off
ended
up
resorting
to
just
using
the
bottle
opener
through
it
the
taste
is
mostly
prunes
black
pepper
red
wine
with
a
hint
of
dark
toast
at
first
and
soon
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
and
toast
become
stronger
esp
as
it
warms
the
body
is
fairly
light
but
its
lively
and
zesty
this
is
a
good
solid
porter
with
lasting
flavour
and
coimplexity
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
even
though
its
not
a
thirstquencher
it
is
very
flavorful
incredibly
well
balanced
and
just
tastes
great
overall
this
is
yet
another
badass
english
brew
from
the
lovely
people
at
the
ol
tadcaster
brewery
im
beginning
to
think
that
theyre
infallible
in
fact
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
porter
one
of
the
best
ive
had
great
nose
and
taste
as
well
as
an
excellent
feel
and
finish
golden
very
drinkable
will
revisit
this
one
for
sure
d
whats
not
to
like
i
love
porter
and
this
is
a
darned
good
porter
i
loved
it
before
i
reviewed
it
i
am
loving
it
as
i
am
reviewing
it
and
i
will
love
it
again
nuff
said
d
this
is
one
the
best
tasting
porters
around
like
all
the
other
samuel
smiths
brews
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
compared
to
a
lot
of
the
other
small
brewery
beers
samuels
smiths
is
also
an
excellent
value
drinkability
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
would
seek
out
again
but
would
have
a
hard
time
picking
this
up
if
it
was
next
to
the
oatmeal
stout
d
this
would
make
a
nice
session
porter
with
a
low
abv
the
only
thing
i
didnt
really
enjoy
was
the
sharp
twang
note
off
the
bat
in
the
taste
department
is
this
the
best
porter
ever
i
definitely
think
not
but
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
d
this
is
an
excellent
porter
so
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
good
amount
of
complexity
in
terms
of
flavour
one
of
samual
smiths
better
offerings
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
surprisingly
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
at
5
but
it
doesnt
really
detract
from
the
drinkinabilty
as
this
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
i
could
session
this
one
all
night
a
550
ml
bottle
of
the
famous
taddy
porter
the
beer
is
a
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
few
centimeters
of
offwhite
foam
the
aroma
is
inviting
with
chocolate
biscuit
and
barely
detectable
dark
rum
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
palate
the
flavor
profile
is
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
little
twang
as
it
finishes
smoothly
flavorful
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
great
porter
another
classic
from
the
folks
at
samuel
smith
loved
drinking
this
for
its
aroma
flavour
makes
me
want
to
board
the
flying
scotsman
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brown
near
black
with
some
excellent
head
and
just
a
bit
of
lacing
nice
strong
scent
very
dark
with
hints
of
chocolate
a
bit
of
vanilla
great
burnt
grains
but
a
slight
alcohol
scent
too
which
is
odd
for
a
5er
excellent
taste
as
well
nice
earthy
flavor
good
burnt
grains
nice
roast
coffee
finish
but
again
just
a
slight
alcohol
kick
that
shouldnt
be
there
in
a
beer
this
strength
very
smooth
very
silky
a
truly
wonderful
porter
d
this
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
the
few
slight
disappointments
in
taste
would
in
no
way
prevent
me
from
drinking
another
dozen
pints
i
find
myself
wishing
i
had
bought
more
two
thumbs
up
pours
darkness
with
a
billowing
dirty
ivory
head
intricate
lacing
tantalizing
smell
of
roasted
malt
and
espresso
roasted
barley
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
could
definitely
be
fuller
tadcaster
brews
have
so
far
never
failed
to
impress
this
porter
is
great
just
not
quite
of
the
same
caliber
as
their
oatmeal
stout
or
russian
imperial
stout
m
d
smooth
creamy
and
wellrounded
body
which
is
a
little
more
medium
than
it
is
full
an
exceptionally
easy
drinker
and
a
great
session
beer
the
price
is
usually
right
on
them
too
overall
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
this
is
an
enjoyable
almost
sessionable
sipper
and
a
stasndardbearer
for
representation
of
a
classic
style
well
done
does
a
porter
get
better
than
this
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
fluffy
brown
head
that
goes
away
quickly
but
not
before
releasing
tremendous
amounts
of
bread
chocolate
and
molasses
even
a
little
butter
the
taste
is
so
very
smooth
and
mellow
but
is
probably
the
most
complex
thing
ive
ever
had
it
would
take
several
sessions
to
sort
out
all
the
flavors
but
theres
a
malty
spine
of
roasted
things
that
is
incredibly
attractive
its
rather
filling
i
had
half
the
bottle
one
evening
sealed
the
remainder
with
a
vacuvin
and
finished
it
the
next
night
the
difference
in
taste
was
pronounced
the
chocolate
was
even
more
present
and
the
roasty
taste
was
so
much
more
developed
man
what
a
beer
rich
chocolate
with
toffee
and
a
bit
of
mocha
java
around
the
edges
the
aroma
is
full
of
the
same
candy
and
cocoa
flavors
and
the
aftertaste
has
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
to
it
this
is
easily
the
best
english
porter
maybe
just
porter
ive
had
damn
d
this
stuff
is
stellar
and
could
easily
be
sessioned
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
i
cant
exactly
pick
out
what
the
star
of
this
brew
is
and
the
flavors
certainly
arent
muddled
but
i
could
drink
this
for
hours
and
never
get
bored
of
it
id
drink
this
every
day
of
my
life
and
i
can
because
its
available
just
a
block
from
my
house
overall
a
very
solid
brew
by
sam
smith
some
of
their
stuff
i
think
is
overrated
oatmeal
stout
pale
ale
but
this
one
hits
the
mark
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
porter
nice
overall
a
good
porter
i
continue
to
be
impressed
with
samuel
smiths
beers
very
enjoyable
will
come
back
to
this
one
very
dark
almost
black
color
poured
a
nice
tan
creamy
head
and
left
a
good
amount
of
lace
roasted
malt
aroma
and
flavor
with
some
coffee
taste
in
there
too
slightly
tart
and
peppery
nice
and
warming
and
probably
a
decent
choice
during
the
winter
medium
to
fullbodied
and
rich
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
tried
which
generally
are
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
samuel
smiths
taddy
porter
poured
a
very
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
with
an
excellent
fluffy
tan
head
smell
seamed
very
light
to
me
hints
of
dark
fruits
taste
however
was
not
light
tons
of
chocolate
taste
on
the
entry
followed
by
coffee
and
bittersweet
flavors
mouthfeel
was
good
drinkablity
was
ok
i
found
it
the
slightly
filling
overall
this
is
a
great
porter
very
flavorful
will
buy
again
d
im
kinda
kicking
myself
for
waiting
so
long
to
try
this
porters
are
my
favorite
and
this
ranks
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
if
you
like
samuel
smith
oatmeal
stout
you
will
like
this
as
well
samuel
smith
knows
what
they
are
doing
overall
a
very
delicious
porter
from
one
of
the
older
breweries
in
england
a
well
balanced
ale
that
leaves
you
waiting
for
another
sip
or
another
bottle
a
few
of
these
could
definitly
be
had
and
enjoyed
in
a
session
also
most
sam
smith
beers
can
usually
be
found
in
most
decent
beer
stores
and
all
their
offerings
are
excellent
dont
be
afraid
to
grab
a
couple
wow
as
black
as
tar
in
the
mug
revealing
a
deeeep
ruby
hue
if
held
up
to
sunlight
frothy
hearty
reddishbrown
head
of
medium
size
bubbles
that
forms
an
impressive
clingy
cap
after
it
settles
a
bit
relatively
light
aroma
of
chocolate
and
dates
complex
on
the
palette
coffee
dark
chocolate
bread
and
toasted
malts
surprisingly
light
body
for
a
beer
so
dark
but
this
is
a
good
thing
nice
mouthfeel
and
super
smooth
the
coffee
finish
just
goes
on
and
on
impressive
drinkabilityvery
drinkable
this
is
how
a
great
english
porter
should
taste
i
love
it
while
it
smells
like
it
might
be
a
rough
and
dry
and
heavy
brew
it
is
actually
closer
to
mediumbodied
than
fullish
the
coffee
chocolate
and
hints
of
roasted
malt
mix
with
something
buttery
to
make
for
a
very
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
offering
that
is
very
tastey
and
flows
down
your
throat
finishes
with
only
a
slight
dry
backbite
with
some
sweetness
on
it
i
havent
had
too
many
porters
and
i
might
not
have
to
have
another
one
this
beer
tastes
great
is
filling
and
with
a
low
abv
i
culd
sit
and
drink
this
all
day
top
notch
d
this
is
a
great
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
while
playing
some
darts
in
a
bar
worth
finding
to
try
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
english
porters
out
there
very
drinkable
the
body
is
a
little
light
but
its
not
too
thin
drinkability
is
very
high
i
could
easily
enjoy
one
or
two
but
probably
not
any
more
than
that
i
only
have
the
one
bottle
and
i
doubt
ill
buy
more
it
was
definitely
a
nice
prelunch
treat
dill
come
back
to
this
one
d
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
all
four
of
these
tasty
treats
overall
definitely
a
great
porter
if
this
is
available
from
a
cask
i
imagine
it
could
get
almost
all
5s
after
some
of
the
alcohol
mellowed
out
drinkability
is
pretty
high
went
well
with
a
grilled
steak
and
was
nice
on
its
own
after
dinner
finish
is
full
of
raisins
roasty
malty
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
amazing
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
and
wish
i
could
ive
been
meaning
to
try
making
chocolate
mousse
for
a
while
and
their
serving
suggestion
of
pairing
this
has
given
me
inspiration
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
at
a
pub
that
had
it
on
draft
in
the
meantime
i
will
be
purchasing
more
of
the
taddy
porter
when
the
mood
strikes
it
is
midjuly
at
the
time
of
this
review
and
i
think
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
will
only
increase
as
the
fall
and
winter
months
set
in
even
though
i
am
not
even
close
to
being
a
real
beer
advocate
yet
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
tried
so
far
tasted
great
smelled
great
and
felt
great
i
have
drinkin
this
a
few
more
times
since
i
treid
it
and
i
always
get
the
same
impression
of
the
three
samuel
smith
beers
ive
tried
so
far
this
is
by
far
the
best
i
highly
recommend
it
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
porter
with
a
good
complexity
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
drinkability
didnt
taste
like
a
porter
to
me
was
more
like
a
wine
i
didnt
finish
the
beer
i
did
share
it
with
others
and
we
were
not
a
fan
d
the
crisp
flavor
profile
and
low
abv
make
for
a
very
sessionable
porter
definitely
gonna
pick
some
more
of
this
up
i
simply
adore
the
old
school
label
on
this
beer
enjoyed
in
a
plastic
glass
in
a
basic
student
resident
this
is
luxury
classic
black
appearance
with
a
ruby
hue
and
a
thick
tan
head
that
provides
generous
sheets
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
cocoa
caramel
and
figs
great
malty
flavours
at
play
with
a
cocoa
smoothness
playing
off
a
slight
coffee
bitterness
and
a
lot
of
depth
similar
to
raisins
fairly
medium
bodied
and
chewy
mouthfeel
with
minimal
carbonation
huge
drinkability
highly
recommended
mfd
creamy
medium
bodied
english
porter
rich
and
delicious
highly
recommended
an
incredible
brew
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
but
this
is
a
porter
and
not
a
stout
i
think
it
really
sets
the
bar
for
the
style
not
going
overboard
and
pretending
to
be
a
stout
while
still
being
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
drinkability
is
way
high
the
only
limiting
factor
is
that
its
kind
of
expensive
worth
the
try
highly
recommended
d
reminds
me
of
a
good
after
dinner
beer
very
sweet
not
too
filling
lower
abv
makes
me
want
to
drink
several
in
one
sitting
i
had
higher
expectations
maybe
a
bad
batch
d
mammoth
drinkability
highly
enjoyable
a
beer
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
not
rushed
a
very
relaxing
brew
very
drinkable
brew
thinner
than
some
porters
but
overall
a
very
nice
drink
d
i
put
this
one
down
rather
quickly
its
probably
as
sessionable
of
a
porter
as
youll
ever
find
because
of
its
smooth
feel
wonderful
taste
and
lower
abv
5
smooth
fullish
in
body
and
succulently
quaffable
taddy
is
famous
for
a
reason
feeldrinkability
creamy
and
smooth
feel
with
light
tinglyness
from
the
carbonation
a
complex
and
drinkable
porter
not
my
favorite
style
but
with
that
being
said
it
still
rocks
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
prefered
but
its
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
to
date
this
is
a
classic
english
porter
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
very
roasty
malt
structure
with
chocolate
and
coffee
the
flavor
profile
is
also
quite
roasty
some
mild
hops
and
bitter
molasses
balance
out
sweet
chocolates
the
body
is
crisp
and
dry
a
good
drinker
md
very
thin
feel
but
also
very
smooth
very
drinkable
porter
good
drinkable
porter
the
dry
tangy
aftertaste
isnt
that
pleasant
after
a
while
but
it
is
a
smooth
brew
that
is
a
great
example
of
an
english
porter
drinkability
this
is
a
definitely
fun
porter
to
drink
every
sip
keeps
me
redefining
what
i
decided
upon
after
the
last
sip
the
smell
and
taste
seem
to
contradict
each
other
at
times
and
keep
me
thinking
twelve
ounces
seemed
to
evaporate
in
a
crazy
amount
of
time
i
would
have
enjoyed
having
maybe
three
of
these
right
now
in
order
to
really
get
some
time
with
this
one
for
some
reason
it
seems
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
the
experience
but
it
is
definitely
enjoyable
and
repeatable
d
very
drinkable
if
only
is
was
a
little
less
expensive
d
nice
malty
character
with
pleasing
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
easily
drinkable
overall
a
highly
drinkable
porter
with
no
real
flaws
highly
recommended
the
taste
is
great
big
bold
caramel
comes
right
off
lightly
balanced
with
a
tinge
of
bitter
coffeechocolate
flavors
finishing
with
a
crisp
tangy
almost
applelike
flavor
its
so
well
balanced
it
seems
oversimplified
but
that
really
is
the
beauty
of
sam
smith
beautiful
simplicity
very
very
drinkable
much
lighter
than
it
looks
a
classic
beer
for
any
situation
i
hate
mentioning
other
beers
in
reviews
but
i
would
not
be
drinking
this
over
my
sinebrychoff
porter
it
just
tastes
too
simple
and
thin
and
i
think
that
really
detracts
from
the
richness
and
complexity
that
the
brew
should
be
exhibiting
a
highly
drinkable
incredibly
flavorful
and
beautifully
scented
porter
at
5
abv
its
also
a
great
session
beer
if
only
all
sessions
were
this
complex
complex
yet
accessible
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
one
day
in
a
pub
in
england
oh
joy
of
joys
one
of
my
favorite
porters
of
all
time
samuel
smith
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
enjoyed
barely
chilled
in
my
warsteiner
mug
poured
a
rich
midnight
chocolate
brown
smelled
of
fresh
bakers
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
berries
and
bread
dough
taste
was
smooth
and
complex
rich
and
layered
coffee
chocolate
hints
of
biscuit
and
a
kiss
of
fruit
good
times
and
cheers
im
no
expert
when
it
comes
to
porter
but
this
is
the
best
ive
had
hands
down
i
can
actually
differentiate
this
from
a
stout
a
distinction
i
have
trouble
with
regarding
other
porters
notes
impressive
complexity
coming
from
such
an
unimposing
beer
very
good
stuff
note
last
a
drank
a
sammy
smiths
it
came
in
a
clear
glass
bottle
this
one
is
brown
i
dont
know
when
they
changed
but
i
am
glad
they
did
has
become
one
of
my
top
three
beers
of
all
time
taste
introduction
is
slightly
watery
but
the
beer
is
full
of
flavor
nice
big
malty
profile
that
is
primarily
roasted
coffee
but
also
has
a
nice
creamy
chocolate
flavor
finish
is
nice
and
smooth
with
a
lingering
black
coffee
note
a
damn
fine
beer
the
diacetyl
buttery
mouthfeel
and
taste
compliments
the
porter
flavors
very
well
its
smooth
refreshing
and
flows
easily
down
the
throat
very
nice
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
ever
had
by
far
the
best
english
porter
import
ive
never
been
able
to
drink
more
than
a
few
porters
and
im
glad
because
i
start
to
lose
the
distinction
of
flavor
dthis
is
a
stand
alone
porter
that
deserves
to
be
revisited
in
short
order
an
old
favorite
revisited
black

brown
creamy

head
that
leaves
a
flawless
lacing
roasted
coffee
rich
toffee
smooth
and
smoky
accents
creamy

smooth
and

the
texture
is
as
firm
as
it
is
lacey
mellow
and
natural
almost
perfect
in
its
proficiency
the
reason
i
fell
in
love
with
beer
tasting
selecting
from
the
beer
menu
at
russells
in
bloomsburg
nearly
ten
years
ago
for
those
strat
fans
out
there
like
finding
a
supreme
defensive
rating
if
you
only
drink
light
lagers
and
the
occasional
green
bottle
start
and
end
with
this
one
from
the
dark
side
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
redbrown
with
a
short
and
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
it
laces
the
glass
pretty
well
all
the
way
down
the
glass
it
smells
of
very
faint
chocolate
and
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
really
good
as
well
it
tastes
of
the
same
as
the
nose
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
middle
of
it
that
rounds
it
off
very
well
it
tastes
of
sweet
roasted
malt
some
chocolate
then
some
hoppy
bitter
taste
and
then
finally
a
caramel
flavor
that
is
really
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
clean
which
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
porter
definately
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
definitely
another
winner
from
ol
tadcaster
i
recommend
trying
one
for
sure
if
youre
into
porters
this
is
a
good
beer
to
get
i
only
drink
them
but
so
often
but
this
is
a
good
one
it
has
a
nice
taste
and
isnt
overly
heavy
overall
a
deliciously
drinkable
porter
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
but
pretty
well
balanced
just
like
i
like
em
if
you
havent
tried
it
do
yourself
a
favor
its
pricey
but
worth
the
cash
d
porter
is
not
my
favorite
but
they
are
starting
too
grown
on
me
this
was
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
drink
it
with
a
meal
but
before
one
as
an
appetizer
or
after
as
dessert
would
be
great
i
might
get
it
again
the
taste
was
a
bit
off
fro
me
so
i
might
choose
another
porter
before
this
one
but
i
would
not
pass
this
one
up
if
it
was
offered
to
me
d
great
porter
sessionable
well
deserving
of
its
fine
reputation
p
s
paired
this
with
a
grilled
frikadellen
on
a
crusty
roll
meat
was
a
nice
combo
with
the
smokey
roasted
bitterness
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
packed
with
flavor
d
this
is
a
slow
drinker
to
say
the
least
but
a
very
enjoyable
and
complex
beer
much
better
than
the
other
english
porters
ive
had
i
could
drink
maybe
two
of
the
big
550ml
bottles
but
itd
take
me
a
while
because
id
savor
them
so
much
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
overall
the
competence
and
talent
of
the
brewers
is
apparent
in
this
beer
but
it
just
wasnt
for
me
it
was
obviously
well
thought
out
and
well
made
i
guess
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
oh
well
d
fantasitic
on
a
cold
night
seasonal
for
me
overall
great
porter
with
a
full
body
delivers
on
the
hype
d
well
rounded
balanced
with
full
flavors
makes
this
a
stand
out
and
a
joy
to
consume
its
been
at
least
a
few
years
since
ive
had
a
taddy
porter
and
damn
glad
i
picked
another
up
this
brew
could
easily
be
a
session
or
a
sipper
depending
on
my
mood
bottoms
up
extremely
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
which
such
great
flavors
truly
world
class
in
my
book
d
my
favorite
english
porter
enough
said
i
only
wish
it
didnt
cost
so
much
i
could
break
the
bank
with
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
was
quite
surprised
by
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
i
quite
expected
more
carbonation
however
this
beer
has
very
little
this
does
makes
sense
to
me
though
the
historical
porter
was
originally
a
blend
of
three
beers
a
stale
one
a
mild
and
a
pale
seems
to
me
like
there
was
a
good
chance
the
final
product
would
have
very
little
carbonation
due
to
the
stale
not
to
mention
these
were
all
real
ales
and
cask
conditioned
to
mention
meaning
they
would
have
less
carbonation
to
begin
with
i
believe
that
the
mouthfeel
on
this
engineered
porter
is
just
about
perfect
seems
to
be
very
accurate
according
to
descriptions
this
is
one
drinkable
beer
great
to
session
prolly
the
best
english
porter
ive
ever
had
well
at
least
to
date
real
impressed
with
this
one
i
will
be
coming
back
to
it
anytime
i
feel
the
need
for
an
authentic
english
porter
this
is
where
ill
look
mouth
is
left
clean
and
dry
quite
black
with
a
nice
creamy
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
some
smoke
and
sweetness
delicious
taste
that
tastes
just
as
it
smells
and
the
texture
is
perfect
nice
and
creamy
with
light
carbonation
and
just
perferct
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
this
beer
is
excellent
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
i
order
this
beer
every
time
im
anywhere
that
serves
it
mouthfeel
is
full
but
has
a
moderate
body
and
finishes
tannic
and
powdery
dry
and
crisp
small
bubbly
tingle
flourishes
in
the
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
that
brings
back
fond
memories
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
pours
a
thick
brownblack
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
froth
of
the
head
clings
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
very
smooth
beer
with
all
sorts
of
different
flavors
coming
through
chocolatesfigscoffeeand
berries
are
just
to
name
a
few
it
is
low
on
carbonation
and
very
filling
refreshing
and
crisp
on
the
palate
leaves
it
begging
for
more
very
easy
do
drink
and
if
you
get
hooked
you
can
drink
it
all
night
a
good
quafable
porter
that
is
recommended
very
sessionable
d
overall
a
good
porter
that
i
would
rink
for
but
nothing
that
really
blows
you
away
a
good
beer
from
sam
smith
but
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
like
it
but
you
have
to
definitely
be
a
fan
of
the
roasty
aspect
of
a
beer
to
enjoy
this
one
also
you
to
enjoy
the
thick
mouthfeel
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
overall
a
good
porter
that
nearly
exemplifies
the
style
without
doing
anything
crazy
to
the
style
this
is
an
english
porter
and
what
it
should
be
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
porters
lots
of
flavor
in
this
beer
d
below
par
with
some
elements
that
detract
from
the
overall
enjoyment
drinkability
nice
session
porter
easy
to
quaff
and
a
nice
beer
that
i
pick
up
every
now
and
again
velvety
soft
mouthfeel
rich
and
creamy
and
a
mediumheavy
body
this
is
the
first
taddy
porter
ive
had
since
i
started
reviewing
and
even
after
hundreds
of
other
beers
its
still
as
amazing
as
i
remember
a
legendary
beer
from
a
legendary
brewery
and
for
damned
good
reason
im
already
liking
this
as
i
pour
it
into
a
pint
glass
as
black
as
a
stout
with
an
attractive
whipped
head
mocha
and
chocolate
in
the
aroma
quite
sweet
a
little
roasted
character
too
okay
now
first
sip
mmm
delightful
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
flavors
are
soft
some
roasted
flavor
and
baking
chocolate
a
little
smokiness
on
the
side
its
somewhat
sweet
too
very
pleasant
indeed
d
a
decent
porter
for
me
but
a
little
more
sweet
then
i
would
have
liked
pours
deep
auburn
with
large
bubbles
in
the
tan
head
and
leaves
no
ring
or
lacing
inside
the
pint
glass
aroma
presents
chocolate
and
little
coffee
with
subtle
hints
of
dark
cherries
and
sugared
raisins
a
roasted
flavor
of
chewy
chocolate
nougat
nuts
and
coffee
again
these
flavors
help
accentuate
the
medium
body
and
soft
mouthfeel
that
balance
the
finish
of
bitter
hops
and
dense
malt
famous
taddy
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
flavorsome
benchmark
porter
from
a
brewery
rich
in
english
tradition
and
history
2013
update
slight
adjustment
upwards
by
25
points
this
beer
has
stood
the
test
of
time
still
awesome
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
a
slow
night
by
the
fire
excellent
this
beer
far
exceeded
my
expectations
i
was
fairly
disappointed
with
this
it
wasnt
bad
just
not
as
robust
as
i
had
hoped
after
immensely
enjoying
both
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
and
imperial
stouts
im
glad
i
had
it
but
i
would
take
the
oatmeal
stout
over
this
any
day
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
porters
it
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
tried
if
not
the
best
i
mean
all
you
need
to
do
is
look
at
the
reviews
and
scores
of
this
beer
to
realize
that
it
is
a
great
one
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
mild
carbonation
leaves
a
bit
of
stickiness
on
the
lips
very
sessionable
a
most
excellent
porter
indeed
a
classic
of
the
style
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
smells
roasty
and
winey
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
dark
sherry
tastes
beautifully
balanced
between
the
firm
malt
roastiness
slightly
bready
flavor
in
the
background
and
a
touch
of
graininess
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
nice
to
revisit
an
old
favorite
poured
very
very
dark
brown
not
much
light
passed
though
it
had
a
small
tan
head
and
smelled
a
little
of
perhaps
coffee
chocolate
perhaps
a
mix
of
the
two
taste
was
malty
coffee
and
a
bit
chocolatey
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
from
sam
smiths
as
their
other
beers
are
great
this
was
onlt
good
at
best
you
want
a
real
porter
go
for
rogues
mocha
porter
i
certainly
agree
with
many
when
i
say
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
tasted
it
pours
stunningly
black
with
a
tan
head
that
makes
for
a
perfect
picture
it
smells
a
little
chocolaty
and
nutty
as
well
as
a
little
scent
of
coffee
its
taste
is
creamy
and
smooth
ending
with
a
little
chocolate
on
the
tongue
as
well
as
a
mild
nut
aftertaste
a
very
complex
tasting
beer
this
is
absolutly
a
traditional
porter
a
must
for
any
porter
lover
this
is
probably
the
best
porter
ive
yet
sampled
samuel
smith
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
this
beer
clearly
justifies
my
strong
liking
of
the
company
pours
a
pitchblack
opaque
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
smell
is
of
burnt
chocolate
and
espresso
taste
is
full
of
cocoa
dark
coffee
chocolate
and
slight
malts
an
excellent
porter
goes
down
smooth
with
no
hints
of
bitterness
semisweet
dark
chocolate
flavor
lingers
on
the
palate
and
is
very
sweet
and
satisfying
would
go
great
with
anything
sweet
especially
chocolate
very
crisp
clear
flavor
awesome
sample
definitely
recommended
another
great
beer
from
samuel
smith
one
of
the
better
porters
i
have
have
a
sweet
tasting
beer
from
the
roasted
malt
and
coffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
a
little
bit
of
hops
helps
to
not
make
it
overwhelmingly
sweet
quite
thick
and
creamy
for
a
porter
not
thin
like
some
other
porters
tend
to
be
it
had
a
nutty
flavor
and
again
of
chocolate
on
the
tongue
it
was
comfortable
to
drink
and
was
soft
in
the
mouth
overall
a
solid
beer
this
is
about
as
good
a
traditional
porter
that
you
will
find
in
the
bottle
it
pours
a
luscious
thick
and
creamy
head
that
is
nicely
tan
and
smooth
the
beer
retains
and
laces
quite
well
the
smell
is
deep
chocolate
mocha
perhaps
some
raisin
or
plum
definitely
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
emininently
drinkable
you
will
experience
a
strong
roasted
malt
taste
throughout
but
more
pronounced
in
the
finish
with
more
of
the
creamy
mocha
and
chocolate
flavors
on
the
front
end
this
beer
is
just
a
pleasure
the
mouthfeel
is
pure
cream
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
tart
perhaps
a
bit
too
roasty
but
still
reasonably
mild
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
from
start
to
finish
buttery
creamy
and
unlike
so
many
poor
imitations
not
at
all
watery
and
thin
this
beer
is
a
classic
for
its
style
and
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
drinkability
is
better
than
most
porters
but
this
beer
almost
tastes
more
like
a
stout
than
a
porter
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
could
definitely
put
a
few
of
these
back
d
this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
with
some
pub
fare
the
bitter
after
taste
would
hinder
a
session
that
didnt
include
food
but
only
slightly
im
noticing
a
real
trend
with
samuel
smith
after
sampling
two
of
their
brews
im
hoping
it
doesnt
continue
there
is
a
seriously
wicked
vinegarysalty
aftertaste
to
this
beer
the
taste
is
delicious
butterscotch
some
coffee
even
some
dark
roasted
fruits
and
malt
but
it
is
absolutely
destroyed
by
some
component
i
cannot
identify
as
a
result
a
beer
that
becomes
less
and
less
drinkable
by
the
minute
pours
deep
black
with
a
beautiful
and
thick
twofinger
brown
head
which
turns
fluffy
as
it
as
it
slowly
fades
away
leaving
a
consistent
lacing
all
around
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
sweet
candy
and
cocoa
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
and
nuts
not
as
fullbodied
or
thick
as
i
would
have
expected
but
drinkable
and
fairly
tasty
although
i
do
like
my
porters
a
little
bolder
d
this
has
definitely
increased
my
fondness
for
porters
and
the
like
and
for
a
hophead
such
as
myself
the
perfect
balance
that
i
always
find
coming
from
the
tadcaster
is
a
welcome
in
my
fridge
anytime
d
one
of
the
most
complex
porters
ive
ever
tried
ridiculously
well
built
and
solidly
hopped
this
is
a
shining
example
of
what
the
art
of
brewing
can
be
sadly
im
poor
and
this
is
not
cheap
stuff
anyhow
i
think
that
there
are
lesser
porters
out
there
as
far
as
drinkability
d
pretty
drinkable
but
a
little
rich
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
in
an
evening
d
interesting
beer
i
like
it
enough
to
finish
one
and
try
it
again
another
time
probably
the
best
porter
ive
ever
had
this
tasty
masterpiece
from
samuel
smith
is
a
must
for
porter
lovers
it
might
also
be
the
best
beverage
that
samuel
smith
brews
the
head
is
a
light
creamy
brown
modest
but
durable
and
the
body
leaves
a
bubbly
lattice
work
along
the
mug
as
it
recedes
taddy
porter
is
practically
black
in
color
the
flavors
are
subtle
but
noticeable
with
chocolate
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
mocha
present
smooth
and
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
taddy
porter
is
easy
on
the
palate
while
accosting
the
taste
buds
with
a
multitude
of
flavors
it
isnt
at
all
difficult
to
follow
one
with
another
and
it
also
intersperses
well
with
a
good
brown
ale
or
a
fruity
flavorful
belgian
style
close
to
a
masterpiece
another
is
a
line
of
great
brews
pours
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
about
a
finger
of
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
aroma

great
malty
roasty
and
slightly
chocolaty
taste
is
mostly
roasty
but
chocolate
caramel
toffee
and
biscuits
round
out
the
flavor
almost
no
bitterness
and
no
hop
flavor
good
mouthfeel
mediumlight
body
moderatelylow
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
smooth
wellbalanced
easy
drinking
brew
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
one
i
will
certainly
be
having
again
drinkability
if
you
like
darker
beers
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
an
easy
to
drink
porter
not
overly
robust
but
a
little
sweet
and
relaxing
in
my
opinion
a
great
beer
for
a
great
winter
session
beer
pours
a
thick
black
color
with
an
ample
brown
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
hints
of
coffeechocolate
in
the
nose
taste
starts
out
simple
upfront
and
then
fades
to
a
mild
smokinesscoffee
flavor
at
the
back
of
the
throat
has
the
complexity
of
a
chocolate
malt
beverage
its
certainly
very
drinkable
and
true
to
the
style
decent
just
as
with
the
nut
brown
the
flavor
features
more
hops
than
the
aroma
suggests
robust
dry
malty
flavors
theres
a
creaminess
to
it
that
carries
well
the
small
amount
of
sweetness
dalthough
overall
this
is
very
good
beer
the
drinkability
for
me
ios
not
that
high
it
is
above
average
and
i
will
have
it
again
but
most
likely
only
one
bottle
per
session
when
i
have
it
this
beer
was
a
little
different
than
what
i
was
expecting
in
terms
of
taste
before
i
get
to
that
let
me
say
its
a
great
beer
but
maybe
not
one
most
people
would
go
for
everytime
it
was
very
dark
with
creamy
coloured
head
leaving
a
nice
lace
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
pretty
strong
and
you
can
definently
smell
somethng
slightly
sweet
and
chocolately
and
something
that
smelled
to
me
like
a
dark
roast
coffee
and
the
mouthfeel
mighty
thick
in
a
good
way
and
so
smooooth
velvetly
almost
finally
the
taste
was
rich
and
strong
the
actual
coffee
taste
is
somewhat
stronger
than
the
smell
it
leaves
a
bit
of
a
bite
on
your
palate
thats
rather
tart
and
kind
of
reminded
me
of
raisins
overall
its
a
nice
one
from
sam
smith
d
highly
drinkable
extremely
sessionable
each
sip
invites
the
next
incredible
porter
with
tons
of
flavour
robust
delicious
and
would
like
to
see
more
often
i
will
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
overall
a
solid
brew
but
probably
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
d
tastyyet
subtle
easy
on
the
tongue
i
might
get
this
every
once
in
awhile
its
no
ed
fit
but
it
holds
its
own
went
great
with
my
pork
loin
but
had
no
chance
versus
the
garlic
mashed
potatoes
overall
a
nice
beer
in
many
respects
but
it
falls
down
a
bit
on
taste
it
just
seems
to
have
a
very
dull
flavor
however
its
definitely
a
quality
beer
and
worth
a
try
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
on
the
pour
and
appears
black
in
the
glass
with
a
huge
frothy
browntan
head
that
dies
down
quickly
the
smell
is
not
overwhelming
but
what
is
there
is
enjoyable
slightly
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
are
about
all
that
is
discernable
the
taste
is
also
pretty
neutral
but
enjoyable
very
well
balanced
slightly
malty
and
finishes
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
velvety
light
carbonation
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
excellently
done
but
no
real
wow
factor
i
guess
if
you
make
a
beer
that
is
this
sessionable
and
smooth
wow
is
not
an
issue
this
is
an
outstanding
porter
smells
of
toffee
coffee
roasted
nuts
and
chocolate
another
buttery
offering
with
a
nice
head
and
some
lacing
also
has
a
scent
of
caramel
taste
is
great
of
bittering
hops
and
coffee
some
nice
butterscotch
flavoring
to
it
as
well
an
interesting
beer
and
again
at
a
lower
price
i
would
buy
this
all
the
time
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
taddy
porter
is
highly
drinkable
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
d
would
pair
well
with
a
steak
or
beef
meal
with
chips
a
little
heavy
but
packs
full
flavor
d
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
quite
sessionable
pours
a
thick
dark
coffee
color
fizzy
cola
colored

settles
very
quickly
smells
faintly
of
toasted
malt
peat
oak
coffee
maybe
even
vanilla
taste
is
remeniscent
of
a
dark
chocolate
very
high
in
cacao
taste
lightly
roasted
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fizzy
mildly
astringent
but
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
out
any
undesireables
drinkability
is
good
flavor
is
well
balanced
nice
malty
profile
id
definetly
drink
this
again
drinkability
a
solid
porter
not
the
best
one
ive
had
nor
the
worse
very
good
though
mothers
milk
in
my
humble
opinion
this
is
the
best
porter
i
have
tried
so
far
and
the
one
all
others
will
be
judged
by
a
good
winter
beer
i
love
the
strength
of
flavor
while
at
the
same
time
being
very
smooth
complex
coffeeroasted
grainshint
of
chocolate
flavors
that
change
as
the
beer
warms
in
my
glass
very
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
below
nice
tan
head
which
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
surface
and
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
not
a
powerful
aroma
notes
of
toasted
malt
sweetness
maybe
a
touch
of
chocolate
taste
is
straightforward
dark
malts
again
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
some
herbal
hops
in
the
finish

bittersweet
aftertaste

comments
god
bless
samuel
smith
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
something
very
different
from
the
rest
of
the
porters
i
will
say
one
thing
i
was
expecting
this
porter
to
have
more
of
a
nutty
taste
like
fullers
porter
no
worries
though
this
is
a
very
nice
and
unique
beer
of
all
the
finest
beers
of
all
the
lands
the
taddy
porter
ranks
near
the
top
of
the
list
the
beutiful
black
color
with
just
a
hint
of
ruby
held
to
the
light
the
granite
nose
and
finish
with
a
biscutty
maltiness
underneth
roasty
chocolatey
hints
of
coffee
its
all
here
with
a
deceptively
light
body
and
ever
deepening
levels
of
malt
this
is
everything
beer
should
be
d
this
beer
was
solid
all
the
way
around
the
bitterness
gave
it
a
nice
character
that
complimented
the
smooth
nature
of
the
beer
definitely
a
solid
beer
final
statement
a
lovely
porter
will
definately
purchase
a
bottle
of
this
i
like
this
more
than
fullers
drinkability
nothing
objectionable
to
prevent
me
from
having
more
than
one
except
that
in
good
taste
has
so
many
good
beers
that
i
must
move
on
and
try
another
this
is
recommended
for
the
porter
style
samuel
smiths
the
famous
taddy
porter
pours
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
milk
chocolate
colored
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
with
a
foil
neck
and
crown
cover
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
make
up
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
also
caramel
malt
a
bit
of
chocolate
some
raison
is
also
present
and
maybe
even
a
hint
of
coffee
id
like
a
thicker
mouthfeel
a
very
enjoyable
beer
d
this
is
a
very
good
porter
great
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
flavors
pours
black
with
light
brown
head
that
stayed
throughout
nice
aroma
of
caramel
and
black
licorice
softly
carbonated
very
tasty
excellent
porter
this
stuff
is
fine
and
i
highly
recommend
it
to
those
of
you
who
like
porters
if
you
like
porters
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
it
drinkability
pretty
good
there
are
much
better
but
much
worse
porters
out
there
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
lighter
body
for
the
style
this
one
is
less
filling
than
most
porters
but
goes
down
extremely
smooth
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
thick
head
arises
that
is
tan
in
color
the
head
does
not
dissipate
fully
and
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
porter
is
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
reddish
hue
when
held
to
the
light
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
with
a
little
carbonation
but
not
so
little
that
it
feels
watery
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
porters
that
i
have
had
a
nice
chocolateroasted
nutsmoky
flavor
the
flavor
is
surprising
at
the
start
but
continues
to
be
pleasant
throughout
this
beer
is
a
little
heavy
so
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
it
in
any
situation
but
one
thing
can
be
said
the
samuel
smith
brewing
co
knows
what
they
are
doing
drinkability
soft
and
easy
goes
down
well
will
gladly
have
another
when
available
the
metallic
flavour
carried
over
into
the
taste
but
not
overly
so
lightly
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
flavours
mixed
well
with
mild
coffee
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
black
licorice
lightly
carbonated
but
mediumbodied

not
watery
at
all
d
traditional
porter
taste
that
sets
the
bar
high
with
a
complexity
and
drinkability
that
can
hardly
be
touched
as
the
beer
warms
the
fruity
english
ale
character
comes
out
and
smokiness
nestles
under
the
great
porter
sweetness
an
all
around
great
ale
bottom
line
samuel
smiths
certainly
can
crank
out
the
fine
brews
no
wonder
they
are
my
favourite
brewery
from
the
uk
overall
i
think
this
is
the
best
on
style
of
the
sss
i
have
had
and
also
is
my
favorite
drinkability

great
a
nice
porter
that
is
tasty
and
reliable
as
any
md
this
is
very
good
creamy
and
elicious
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
and
is
easy
to
drink
its
worth
a
try
its
a
great
porter
that
seems
to
have
a
little
something
extra
drinkability
quite
good
and
enjoyable
would
definitely
get
this
again

7
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
some
occasional
lighter
brown
hints
along
the
edges
of
the
mug
a
nice
one
finger
tan
heard
with
no
real
lacing

is
very
mild
light
roasted

hints
taste
is
solid
smooth
and
oddly
clean
for
a
porter
light
lemon
some
toasted
malt
just
a
very
mild
hint
of
hops
in
the
end
feel
is
medium
bodied
pretty
good
overall
a
tasty
porter
if
nothing
too
noticeable
or
strong
got
some
bite
to
it
this
is
not
a
dessert
porter
but
much
to
be
respected
dont
drink
this
one
cold
at
all
needs
warmth
to
show
its
character
otherwise
the
bittertart
notes
take
over
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easy
as
i
said
before
this
is
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
and
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
another
great
offering
from
samuel
smith
they
have
yet
to
disappoint
worth
a
try
most
definitly
close
to
perfect
very
dark
in
color
with
no
light
through
glass
medium
head
but
not
lasting
long
and
with
no
noticeable
lacing
smell
is
a
little
sweet
then
smoky
chocolate
taste
is
also
smoky
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
or
coffee
not
very
complex
as
expected
for
a
porter
but
it
may
add
to
its
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
a
little
acidic
on
the
perimeter
of
the
tongue
overall
a
good
beer
all
though
this
is
extremely
deliscious
i
would
say
that
more
than
two
would
be
hard
to
drink
the
intense
and
dark
flavors
make
this
more
of
a
slow
sipper
a
must
buy
appearance
is
very
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
sticks
around
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolates
taste
again
of
rich
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
thats
smooth
and
creamy
making
it
easy
to
swallows
so
far
its
been
hard
for
samuel
smith
to
dissapoint
me
its
a
very
well
balanced
porter
and
great
one
to
try
for
anybody
shy
of
darker
beers
d
makes
good
company
with
the
nut
brown
ale
and
the
oatmeal
stout
d
its
smooth
and
sweet
finish
makes
this
beer
easy
to
drink
for
a
long
time
drinkability
for
me
it
could
use
just
a
bit
more
body
but
perhaps
the
current
recipe
tested
better
with
focus
groups
so
what
do
i
know
still
though
its
a
worthy
english
porter
and
exceedingly
drinkable
it
gets
only
a
good
for
drinkability
but
its
not
its
fault
i
wish
this
was
fresh
from
the
tap
still
very
good
better
as
it
warms
it
is
a
tasty
beverage
color
is
a
rich
deep
brown
almost
black
which
i
like
in
a
porter
aroma
is
intriguing
with
one
sniff
i
get
hints
of
chocolate
with
the
next
roast
coffee
flavor
is
not
as
rich
as
i
expected
but
it
is
typical
of
a
good
porter
with
strong
hoppy
overtones
smoky
undertones
and
a
soupcon
of
coffee
this
is
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
savored
not
chugged
i
will
have
another
i
could
drink
several
of
these
poured
from
a
16
9oz
brown
bottle
is
a
dark
black
you
cant
see
through
with
a
3
finger
creamy
tan
head
on
aggressive
pour
aroma
is
very
chocolaty
and
the
taste
initially
comes
off
as
a
lot
of
bittersweet
chocolate
halfway
into
the
glass
it
becomes
a
little
more
roasty
and
acidic
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
carbonation
isnt
too
high
and
enough
to
make
it
interesting
drinkability
good
flavor
and
texture
one
of
the
better
traditional
porters
out
there
pours
a
cleanclear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
one
finger
plus
tan
creamy
head
which
lasts
a
little
while
nice
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
roasted
malts
and
toffee
the
taste
is
very
nice
of
maltstoffee
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
brew
really
surprised
me
very
tasty
will
definitely
add
this
one
to
my
list
pours
a
big
head
i
almost
had
it
fall
over
the
top
but
the
head
was
so
great
that
it
fell
over
the
edge
and
stayed
it
came
back
and
left
a
thick
little
head
that
didnt
go
anywhere
the
color
is
black
a
slight
malty
characteristic
comes
through
with
a
little
roastiness
nothing
big
and
noticable
the
flavor
is
very
bready
but
light
slight
roasted
malts
and
bread
thats
all
i
got
mouthfeel
was
nice
wasnt
as
smooth
as
i
like
my
porters
i
would
try
this
again
but
not
anytime
soon
good
experience
though
i
made
this
a
sam
smiths
weekend
thanks
to
the
brown
bottles
460
reviews
as
of
this
posting
i
wont
pontificate
to
extremes
about
how
good
this
beer
really
is
i
will
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
this
style
if
not
the
favorite
of
the
style
enjoy
it
if
you
see
one
its
worth
trying
d
flavor
increases
as
brew
warms
easy
drinking
sessionable
recommended
great
for
someone
who
is
afraid
of
dark
beer
the
creamy
texture
satisfies
and
despite
looking
heavy
the
beer
was
not
filling
a
22
oz
bottle
was
easy
drinking
dark
color
creamy
white
head
that
retains
some
of
the
darker
hues
of
the
drink
smells
slightly
yeasty
kind
of
a
fruity
apple
aroma
smells
sweet
taste
is
somewhat
malty
not
overly
strong
seems
well
carbonated
a
little
over
carbonated
for
my
liking
but
does
not
affect
the
overall
quality
finishes
well
with
a
bite
that
leaves
a
persistent
roasted
malt
after
taste
overall
a
smooth
pleasant
combination
pours
dark
with
a
great
creamy
head
aroma
is
a
grainy
coffee
easy
to
drink
and
mediumbodied
a
mild
coffee
taste
is
the
main
characteristic
this
seems
a
little
less
malty
than
other
porters
but
its
wellbalanced
and
a
topnotch
pick
for
a
fine
brew
the
only
downside
is
its
price
this
beer
is
black
with
a
thick
cream
color
head
the
smell
is
sweet
roasted
and
coffee
like
the
taste
is
malty
roasted
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
just
shy
of
chewy
i
think
that
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
porter
beer
the
smoothness
and
flavor
make
it
quite
drinkable
not
over
the
top
not
really
strong
diverse
and
pleasant
the
flavors
all
work
nicely
together
with
no
noticeable
downside
quite
tasty
drinkability
a
wellmade
porter
from
samuel
smith
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
so
i
will
rate
it
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
the
beer
pours
opaque
black
with
a
full
tan
head
the
foam
quickly
disapates
leaving
behind
a
light
cover
throughout
the
the
drink
the
aroma
is
more
complex
than
i
was
expecting
more
chocolate
and
caramel
than
coffee
i
get
a
little
blueberry
as
well
the
flavor
has
more
coffee
dark
malt
than
the
aroma
theres
noticable
hop
bitternes
but
not
much
for
aromatic
hops
hips
are
well
balanced
with
the
malt
characteristics
such
that
neither
is
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
but
this
isnt
a
russian
imperial
stout
carbonation
level
is
good
this
is
a
good
drink
im
not
a
porterstout
fan
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
this
is
better
than
many
other
porters
ive
had
this
is
a
classic
english
porter
for
sure
makes
for
a
nice
session
d
i
couldnt
have
but
one
of
these
beers
very
rich
very
strong
but
good
an
excellent
beer
overall
and
extremely
sessionable
drinkability
not
many
better
ways
to
spend
an
evening
that
with
a
few
of
these
if
you
enjoy
english
porter
or
any
porter
for
that
matter
make
sure
you
experience
this
beer
poured
an
almost
black
color
moderate
tan
head
that
left
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
caramel
roasted
malts
buttery
toffee
the
taste
is
of
light
toffee
caramel
hint
of
coffee
a
bit
sour
lightly
carbonated
with
a
full
body
nice
and
smooth
very
good
overall
though
i
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
could
knock
back
a
few
the
taste
is
extraordinary
there
is
a
certain
burnt
grain
taste
up
front
accompanied
by
coffee
chocolate
and
a
syrupy
sweet
malt
flavor
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
bitterness
to
the
finish
for
balance
this
brew
is
smooth
rich
and
complex
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
and
creamy
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
porter
ive
tried
and
another
outstanding
beer
from
sam
smith
but
seriously
good
porter
the
porter
pours
a
nice
deep
coffee
brown
with
a
light
beige
head
that
thins
quite
quickly
it
offers
up
a
rather
heady
almost
earthy
dense
smell
the
taste
is
a
bit
coffee
and
cocoa
flavored
initially
but
with
a
light
sweetness
following
it
finishes
clean
with
sharpness
more
expected
with
a
higher
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thick
and
almost
bready
a
bit
heavy
to
drink
unless
you
favor
stouts
but
decent
and
filling
a
good
choice
for
to
accompany
a
hearty
meal
or
with
strong
cheeses
pours
a
deep
black
in
normal
light
deep
red
with
a
back
light
the
head
is
a
clay
brown
that
quickly
settles
strong
raw
hop
aroma
coffee
and
chocolate
a
slight
hint
of
skunkiness
when
first
poured
may
be
just
that
bottle
deep
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
up
front
malt
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
a
light
cleansing
bite
at
the
end
some
fruity
esters
come
out
after
i
get
used
to
the
initial
flavors
mouthfeel
is
full
and
chewey
drinkability
is
nice
for
a
beer
with
this
much
flavor
md
what
can
i
say
a
masterfully
crafted
porter
smooth
sweet
slightly
bitter
all
in
one
easily
the
best
porter
of
this
relatively
unexplored
style
by
me
i
have
ever
had
i
absolutely
recommend
this
classic
to
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
porters
its
also
light
enough
to
recommend
to
anyone
who
is
trying
their
first
one
of
this
style
definitely
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
classics
though
m
poured
from
a
clear
355ml
bottle
into
a
glass
the
beer
is
dark
black
with
a
bit
of
a
ruby
tint
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
dirty
white
with
ok
retenetion
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
to
me
maybe
slightly
week
im
also
getting
maybe
some
hops
or
skunkiness
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
mellow
flavors
blended
well
but
again
i
feel
that
age
or
light
may
have
gotten
to
this
one
it
seems
like
it
is
missing
something
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
a
porter
smooth
and
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
well
it
would
be
if
the
price
was
a
bit
better
per
four
pack
fairly
thin
a
little
more
residual
sweetness
than
i
would
care
for
in
the
style
but
other
than
that
it
isnt
bad
far
from
the
best
english
porter
ive
had
but
far
from
the
worst
as
well
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
some
dark
fruit
it
tastes
the
same
way
to
me
but
in
addition
to
the
initial
malty
sweetness
theres
a
bitter
coffeelike
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
its
a
bit
creamy
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
ive
had
better
porters
verdict
a
standard
a
good
beer
i
would
never
hesitate
to
drink
one
in
front
of
me
but
you
wont
find
my
frige
full
of
them
this
is
one
sessionable
porter
for
the
lovers
of
chocolate
malts
this
is
one
to
drink
as
the
weather
starts
to
cool
down
in
the
pre
winte
rmonths
the
ss
taddy
porter
poured
dark
black
with
a
great
foamy
head
and
lacing
light
aromas
of
roasted
malt
and
tangy
fruit
were
present
and
the
taste
was
amazing
a
pleasant
refreshing
dark
chocolate
coffee
malt
light
but
flavorful
the
backend
was
made
up
of
dried
fruits
and
a
slight
bitterness
great
body
and
cool
on
the
tongue
an
extremely
sessionable
porter
and
very
well
balanced
brew
great
drinkabilty
nice
session
beer
mouthfeel
was
smooth
body
was
thin
to
medium
a
classic
beer
my
favorite
porter
drinkability
one
of
the
best
porters
out
there
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
highly
recommend
it
the
pour
into
my
fullers
nonic
why
didnt
i
use
my
sam
smith
glass
raises
a
shallow
sub
onefinger
head
that
falls
quickly
to
surface
lacing
and
then
to
a
glass
ring
the
heads
hue
is
a
light
tan
the
beer
is
black
initially
but
clearly
a
deep
ruby
when
backlit
the
nose
is
roasted
but
also
has
a
special
earthy
smell
theres
also
some
intense
caramel
and
light
fruitiness
floating
about
the
taste
is
bittersweet
nutty
and
roasted
with
only
the
barest
hints
of
coffee
floating
about
ok
some
chocolate
too
but
i
didnt
notice
at
first
the
earthiness
here
is
probably
from
some
very
nice
hopping
a
bit
of
acid
too
and
some
butteriness
the
mouth
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
high
but
fine
and
tingly
a
very
nice
porter
pours
a
nearblack
with
a
small
head
but
what
is
there
is
thick
and
foamy
with
a
coffeelike
appearance
the
smell
is
delicious
with
coffee
chocolate
and
smoky
malts
coming
through
the
smoked
flavor
is
even
stronger
in
the
taste
more
roasted
malts
come
through
in
the
aftertaste
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
mild
and
syrupy
with
a
nice
balance
this
may
be
the
most
drinkable
porter
i
have
had
a
great
choice
for
the
winter
or
anytime
for
that
matter
after
reading
an
article
in
the
ny
times
on
the
comeback
of
porters
it
was
the
right
time
of
the
season
to
make
my
return
as
well
pouring
into
a
glass
a
nice
head
with
tight
bubbles
appeared
the
smell
was
a
rich
smokey
aroma
which
was
very
inviting
the
first
taste
was
smooth
with
a
full
flavored
mouthfeel
it
finished
with
the
smokeycoffee
aftertaste
the
drinkablility
was
well
rounded
and
made
for
relaxation
after
a
long
day
this
is
a
very
good
porter
a
sipper
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
an
hour
had
passed
and
i
was
still
enjoying
the
same
longlasting
pint
d
this
beer
is
awesome
great
session
beer
if
you
have
money
to
spend
d
one
of
the
best
porters
out
there
im
going
to
move
this
one
to
the
top
of
my
porter
list
i
love
the
feel
and
taste
of
this
beer
pricey
but
worth
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
unfortunately
it
is
very
drinkable
because
it
kinda
lacks
flavor
overall
a
bit
offensive
i
will
probably
give
this
another
try
sometime
maybe
dont
know
if
it
was
just
the
bottle
or
me
that
said
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
better
than
many
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
pretty
drinkable
perfect
pour
into
my
carlsberg
imperial
pint
glass
great
two
finger
that
is
almost
perfectly
even
with
the
lip
of
the
glass
creamy
tan
bread
dough
head
amidst
dark
coffee
hues
good
porter
aromas
hit
the
nostroil
plenty
of
roasted
and
creamy
vanilla
like
malts
great
passover
to
the
mouth
with
more
developed
creaminess
more
light
brunt
malt
notes
in
the
back
of
the
throat
as
well
very
smooth
palte
but
lets
you
know
you
are
packing
on
the
calories
drinkability
easily
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
friggen
good
pours
dark
brown
with
red
edges
a
few
fingers
of
very
creamy
mediumbrown
head
very
good
lace
retention
deep
toasted
bread
nut
and
chocolate
malt
aromas
flavor
conforms
with
the
smell
chewy
chocolate
malts
up
front
with
some
bread
dough
butterscotch
and
nutty
flavors
in
the
center
excellent
drying
burnt
toast
finish
superb
medium
body
with
just
the
right
balance
of
cream
and
carbonation
didnt
really
stand
out
as
drinkable
will
get
another
bottle
another
day
this
may
be
old
or
light
struck
my
bottle
of
samuel
smiths
taddy
porter
is
550ml
with
gold
foil
on
the
top
and
it
is
clear
as
are
all
of
the
samuel
smith
bottles
pours
a
beautiful
deep
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
unfortunately
the
first
thing
i
smell
upon
opening
the
bottle
is
skunkiness
like
every
other
bottle
of
sam
smiths
ive
ever
had
by
letting
it
sit
for
a
while
i
can
get
some
roasted
caramel
flavors
and
some
hops
but
i
cant
totally
get
the
skunkiness
out
of
my
nose
taste
is
roasted
and
nutty
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
as
well
and
if
i
could
keep
the
skunkiness
out
of
my
nose
would
be
spectacular
finish
is
smokey
and
dry
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
would
be
very
drinkable
if
ever
bottle
that
i
ever
purchased
wasnt
skunked
its
a
great
porter
but
unless
they
switch
to
brown
bottles
or
i
can
get
it
straight
out
of
the
case
i
wont
be
buying
it
very
often
overall
this
is
basically
what
i
expected
coming
into
it
thats
not
to
say
it
is
mundane
or
anything
like
that
samuel
smith
just
has
a
certain
feel
to
the
beers
and
this
fits
in
while
differentiating
itself
from
its
other
styles
it
is
an
easy
drinking
porter
and
one
to
be
savored
price
is
my
only
limiting
factor
but
even
at
a
high
price
ill
still
buy
its
that
good
get
my
buzz
on
n
a
taddy
birthday
indeed
d
its
a
decent
porter
that
i
could
sit
and
have
a
few
of
but
nothing
to
rave
about
drinkability
nice
low
abv
easy
drinking
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
im
not
finished
with
this
one
yet
due
to
the
fact
that
i
only
bought
one
and
i
want
to
savor
the
taste
this
is
an
outstanding
porter
d
super
drinkable
at
the
right
temp
not
palatable
when
ice
cold
or
warm
cheers
i
enjoyed
it
most
paired
with
a
few
bites
of
dark
chocolate
d
definitely
a
classic
one
of
the
benchmarks
for
english
porter
excellent
drinkability
drinkability
very
high
for
me
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
or
two
this
will
be
a
great
porter
to
share
with
my
friend
when
he
comes
back
from
new
york
this
fall
an
outstanding
porter
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
as
the
coffee
flavors
are
not
too
dark
and
it
doesnt
sit
too
heavy
complex
flavors
keep
it
interesting
a
very
substantial
brew
thick
yet
smooth
so
it
goes
down
really
easy
low
abv
this
is
one
of
the
widely
available
staples
that
everyone
should
at
least
try
the
body
of
this
beer
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
from
the
assertively
malty
aroma
it
is
still
rich
and
even
a
bit
creamy
though
notes
of
concentrated
malt
intermingle
with
notes
of
chocolate
black
coffee
toffee
and
lots
of
rich
umami
type
notes
the
umami
type
flavors
almost
lend
a
sort
of
saltiness
to
this
brew
though
not
quite
this
beer
really
does
drink
a
lot
richer
than
its
strength
would
suggest
a
mini
meal
in
a
bottle
and
i
can
remember
back
in
my
early
beer
drinking
days
being
shocked
by
the
flavors
packed
into
this
brew
even
now
the
flavors
are
still
quite
jarring
still
this
is
a
tasty
tipple
and
one
i
am
happy
to
revisit
again
eric
pours
a
deep
clear
reddishbrown
with
loads
of
ruby
around
the
edges
and
a
three
finger
medium
tan
head
that
leasts
well
and
leaves
copious
lacing
smell
is
intense
fruity
and
sweet
with
grapes
and
plum
mixing
nicely
with
toffee
notes
and
a
touch
of
roasted
bitterness
as
well
taste
is
heavy
on
the
coffee
but
the
fruit
still
comes
through
as
does
a
caramel
and
chocolate
note
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
and
undercarbonated
but
has
good
body
and
drinkability
is
quite
good
very
good
all
things
considered
but
cant
match
fullers
in
my
books
notes
i
think
the
fullers
london
porter
is
more
assertive
but
this
is
still
a
tasty
porter
definitely
let
this
beer
warm
the
flavors
come
thorugh
a
lot
better
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
purchase
it
again
althought
it
is
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
but
it
is
a
good
treat
drinkability
is
not
very
good
this
beer
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
loads
of
roasted
malt
flavors
with
more
carbonation
then
i
would
expect
for
a
porter
not
a
bad
porter
but
i
dont
agree
with
the
price
color
is
pitch
black
yes
thats
the
beer
the
bottle
is
clear
small
and
scummy
almond
colored
head
smells
sooo
good
english
characteristics
of
course
sweet
and
malty
grassy
hops
inviting
tastes
mild
actually
good
flavor
lightly
roasted
sweet
and
caramelly
to
match
not
at
all
harsh
with
a
lingering
finish
that
is
hop
and
malt
balanced
yet
just
slightly
stale
and
not
quite
fresh
tasting
for
some
reason
it
may
in
fact
have
been
on
the
shelves
a
while
mouthfeel
is
where
this
is
lacking
carbonation
seems
very
artificial
and
a
seperate
part
here
like
a
soda
not
in
quantity
but
quality
of
its
feel
on
the
tounge
and
it
is
also
watery
which
may
be
a
factor
overall
this
beer
is
the
reason
why
i
gave
porters
a
chance
and
look
foward
to
a
good
porter
more
than
any
other
style
if
it
were
priced
better
id
drink
one
a
day
ill
stick
with
anchor
for
special
drinking
or
something
lighter
for
refreshment
which
this
in
fact
acomplishes
well
surprisingly
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
normally
i
would
not
characterize
a
porter
as
crisp
but
this
one
comes
fairly
close
extremely
drinkable
with
a
very
well
rounded
flavor
surprisingly
refreshing
d
easy
drinking
for
the
style
a
soild
offering
cant
wait
to
compare
it
to
fullers
this
beer
has
a
medium
full
mouthfeel
that
completely
envelops
the
palate
but
not
so
much
as
to
affect
drinkability
roasted
barley
melds
with
hops
to
create
a
distinctive
element
of
zest
finishes
with
a
dry
prickly
bath
of
carbonation
which
is
almost
completely
clean
one
of
my
favorite
porters
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
22
oz
bottle
good
creamy
head
and
dark
rich
appearance
as
you
expect
from
a
porter
aroma
and
flavor
is
chocolate
and
toffee
but
subtly
so
as
good
as
this
looked
and
tasted
i
was
disappointed
in
the
mediocre
finish
which
was
watery
and
slightly
metallic
or
i
would
have
rated
this
higher
lovely
body
thick
but
not
lacking
in
carbonation
very
drinkable
esp
for
desert
or
after
dinner
a
king
among
porters
perfect
a
very
good
english
porter
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
an
allaround
wonderful
beer
what
else
can
be
said
pours
a
rich
black
with
ruby
highlights
color
huge
tan
head
that
holds
strong
at
one
inch
with
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
pronounced
and
very
pleasant
mostly
malty
but
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
as
well
the
taste
is
primarily
malt
with
some
bitterness
very
enjoyable
taste
with
no
chalky
aftertaste
or
any
other
unpleasant
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
i
may
be
comparing
this
to
the
outmeal
stout
which
has
an
incredibly
rich
mouthfeel
but
not
watery
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
consider
it
a
good
session
beer
or
something
to
savor
on
my
deck
where
i
had
this
one
cheers
mates
mk
pours
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
tan
colored
head
smell
is
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
butterscotch
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
and
butterscotch
with
notes
of
coffee
rounding
it
out
overall
this
is
a
great
porter
and
another
great
brew
from
this
brewery
with
that
being
said
this
beer
poured
beautifully
into
my
mug
from
the
classic
pint
and
change
bottle
that
samuel
smith
typically
uses
maintains
about
a
finger
of
frother
head
throughout
creates
great
rings
down
the
class
the
aromas
were
fairly
complex
with
hints
of
different
types
of
nuts
and
at
points
chocolate
and
coffee
but
the
taste
is
where
this
porter
shines
by
far
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
this
really
combines
all
the
different
facets
of
a
porter
to
make
one
of
the
best
porters
around
surprisingly
carbonated
with
a
great
drinkability
in
comparision
with
other
porters
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
the
porter
this
is
the
beer
for
you
very
tasty
this
porter
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
quickly
dissipating
head
the
smell
had
dark
roasted
malt
aromas
as
well
as
a
slight
coffee
scent
the
taste
was
full
of
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
medium
hop
profile
and
bitterness
the
taste
was
complex
with
a
number
of
other
flavors
present
although
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
them
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumthick
with
a
mediumlow
carbonation
the
felt
like
i
could
drink
these
on
a
regular
basis
as
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
this
is
an
excellent
porter
and
i
highly
recommend
it
not
the
experience
i
was
hoping
for
this
being
the
famous
taddy
porter
and
all
but
far
from
undrinkableunenjoyable
not
as
bitter
as
most
american
porters
but
not
as
rich
and
flavorful
as
fullers
porter
an
aboveaverage
porter
that
would
be
a
good
session
beer
d
very
nice
complexity
with
good
flavors
the
complexity
of
the
malt
really
comes
through
in
the
smell
and
it
would
be
nice
to
see
all
of
the
complexity
make
it
to
the
taste
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
great
session
beer
it
is
not
too
harsh
flavor
wise
also
it
is
relatively
low
in
alcohol
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
poured
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
was
both
frothy
and
sticky
a
bit
of
lacing
was
left
behind
in
my
pint
glass
the
texture
appears
thick
with
a
somewhat
murky
presence
that
is
enticing
aromas
of
plums
dates
alcohol
roasted
sugar
and
old
raisins
seemed
to
come
out
the
taste
was
dominated
by
malt
fruit
derived
sweetness
smoked
and
burnt
wood
flavors
add
depth
to
the
beer
but
also
seem
outofplace
in
that
they
dont
work
with
the
other
flavors
a
bitter
finish
is
quite
enjoyable
an
interesting
brew
with
unique
flavors
and
a
nice
texture
but
not
all
of
the
elements
i
look
for
in
a
good
porter
are
there
d
very
drinkable
i
would
suggest
this
brew
to
anyone
who
wants
to
start
exploring
the
world
of
porters
its
sweetier
then
their
american
counterparts
overall
a
nice
tasty
beer
that
one
could
be
happy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
with
friends
drinkability
a
good
porter
on
par
with
edmund
fitzgeraldmy
favorite
tartness
implies
a
dry
character
and
masks
the
body
a
bit
very
drinkable
and
could
pass
as
a
session
porter
this
brew
pours
an
almost
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
massive
creamy
and
brown
lacing
is
thorough
and
lasts
until
the
beer
is
finished
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
cream
toffee
and
has
a
touch
of
the
famous
samuel
smiths
house
aroma
the
taste
however
is
rather
bland
for
a
porter
there
is
some
toffee
and
burnt
malt
flavors
that
are
nice
but
nothing
really
stands
out
and
makes
things
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
porter
at
5
abv
it
could
make
for
a
very
sessionable
beer
if
it
had
something
flavor
wise
to
entertain
with
that
said
i
would
choose
summit
great
northern
porter
bells
porter
or
bully
porter
all
between
4
9
and
5
25
abv
as
my
session
porter
of
choice
over
the
famous
taddy
porter
any
day
of
the
week
this
is
excellent
loved
the
creamy
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
very
mild
the
lower
abv
makes
this
a
definite
session
beer
the
famous
taddy
porter
was
one
of
sam
smiths
beers
that
i
intended
to
try
first
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
could
very
well
have
been
one
of
the
first
beers
that
led
me
into
the
craft
brew
world
but
i
picked
up
the
oatmeal
stout
instead
ive
gone
through
a

of
other
beers
in
their
lineup
before
getting
to
this
one

its

seems
offbalance
especially
for

tastes
more

up
the

and

there

poured
from

into

in

dark

the
sweetness
stays
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
long
after
the
swallow
a
mild
alcohol
in
the
back
of
the
throat
but
not
overpowering
the
sweetness
lingers
almost
too
long
a
pleasant
porter
experience
for
sure
but
i
prefer
the
meantime
london
porter
over
this
one
overall
has
some
of
the
elements
similar
to
the
house
style
for
sam
smith
beers
some
unattainable
characteristics
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
really
does
have
some
spicy
steak
blood
elements
without
too
much
of
the
metallic
aspects
very
savory
overall
a
good
porter
recommended
this
porter
poured
out
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
large
yet
quickly
dissappearing
tan
head
the
smell
was
of
coffee
as
well
as
in
the
taste
the
body
in
my
opinion
was
very
light
the
taste
was
a
little
blandalmost
metallic
and
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
maybe
i
will
have
to
go
back
to
this
one
in
the
future
and
try
again
why
dont
i
drink
this
beer
more
simply
amazing
one
of
the
most
flavorful
and
drinkable
porters
out
there
i
can
only
imagine
what
this
beer
tastes
like
fresh
or
not
in
a
clear
bottle
or
dare
i
say
on
cask
amazing
beer
this
certainly
doesnt
live
up
to
the
name
especially
since
it
has
famous
in
it
this
beer
looks
and
smells
great
first
off
really
dark
black
with
a
brown
head
looks
creamy
the
smell
is
sweet
and
rich
could
smell
it
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
cap
a
little
the
taste
is
great
a
light
roasted
malt
flavor
a
bit
grainy
good
though
not
to
much
on
the
mouthful
not
to
strong
but
it
is
smooth
over
all
good
drinkablity
on
this
beer
i
would
like
to
try
more
like
it
overall
a
good
beer
very
enjoyable
but
for
the
money
you
could
get
the
same
quality
taste
for
cheaper
one
i
would
never
turn
down
but
hard
to
drop
the
money
on
this
import
d
goes
down
easy
low
alcohol
a
person
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
i
was
going
to
consign
this
to
my
bottle
collection
and
never
return
to
it
but
it
really
does
improve
as
it
warms
do
yourself
a
favor
and
dont
drink
this
cold
this
was
an
unusual
mixture
that
had
to
grow
on
me
after
several
samplings
mouthfeel
on
the
other
hand
was
superb
a
very
smooth
porter
with
a
substantial
body
and
a
somewhat
drying
effect
at
the
back
of
the
palate
quite
drinkable
but
more
for
an
occasion
of
relaxation
and
sipping
than
a
session
drink
d
well
i
am
going
to
be
able
to
finish
this
despite
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
says
a
lot
actually
the
parching
nature
makes
sessioning
this
one
difficult
at
best
the
beer
is
too
foul
for
foods
i
think
i
will
seek
out
the
oatmeal
stout
and
leave
the
famous
taddy
porter
to
its
notoriety
the
beer
pours
a
dark
almost
opaque
black
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
laces
well
the
whole
way
down
the
glass
the
beer
smells
of
faint
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
where
its
strength
really
lies
the
beer
mixes
roasted
nutty
malts
which
i
believe
are
hazlenuts
with
chocolate
malts
the
beer
is
not
too
sweet
though
because
it
is
balances
nicely
with
some
welcome
bitterness
there
is
a
fantastic
thickness
balanced
nicely
with
some
great
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
the
best
of
the
samuel
smith
beers
i
have
had
so
far
could
pound
a
few
more
the
nose
is
interesting
if
not
overly
appealing
to
me
there
are
some
smoky
notes
in
there
not
so
much
as
your
average
smoked
porter
but
a
bit
the
smoky
flavor
carries
over
in
the
brew
itself
but
on
the
palate
it
adopts
more
of
a
smokehouse
smoked
meat
kind
of
flavor
which
i
dont
care
for
personally
a
touch
of
sourness
makes
this
a
very
complex
brew
although
it
doesnt
have
the
easy
drinkability
of
the
stouts
very
opaque
very
nice
black
color
with
dark
brown
to
red
edges
head
is
about
an
inch
and
dissipates
quickly
very
pleasant
roasty
smells
of
chocolate
coffee
and
barley
mmmm
what
a
porter
taste
is
indeed
complex
and
intense
malty
at
first
then
some
choclate
and
coffee
notes
with
a
tangy
roasty
finish
full
bodied
mouthfeel
that
leaves
dark
fruity
and
mildly
smokey
flavors
on
the
tongue
this
porter
is
what
a
porter
should
be
i
will
be
drinking
many
more
of
these
tasty
beers
from
tadcaster
this
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
dissapears
quickly
the
smell
has
faint
hints
of
coffeebut
it
is
pretty
weak
the
taste
is
a
rich
creamy
mouthful
there
are
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
in
this
beer
the
mf
is
heavy
with
a
well
balanced
flavor
the
mixture
of
flavors
and
the
rich
creamyness
make
this
a
real
treat
this
is
one
porter
not
to
miss
slightly
expensive
but
worth
every
penny
i
really
like
this
one
allot
sam
smith
has
hit
a
homerun
again
this
is
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
ever
had
its
well
balanced
but
also
thick
and
filling
porter
isnt
for
everyone
but
this
should
appeal
to
the
vast
majority
of
porter
drinkers
d
nothing
about
this
beer
was
very
appealing
to
me
its
very
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
you
could
chug
a
bunch
of
these
quickly
but
thats
not
usually
how
i
prefer
to
drink
my
beverages
this
is
what
a
porter
should
taste
like
simple
pure
clean
and
full
of
flavor
a
solid
dose
of
dark
malts
and
a
hint
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
in
both
aroma
and
flaovr
mild
fermentation
sourness
adds
a
complex
layer
in
the
same
way
that
milk
stouts
do
a
medium
body
with
flavors
more
commonly
found
in
heavy
beers
gives
a
creamy
coat
to
the
whole
mouth
with
a
deep
chocolate
layer
without
becomming
thick
or
sugary
sweet
finishes
very
clean
with
a
light
roasted
grain
bitterness
terriffic
from
sip
to
finish
cheers
not
much
of
a
head
on
this
one
however
it
does
exhibit
lacing
similar
to
a
finely
carbonated

not

is
clean
and
seemingly
well
made
just
a

seems
to

an
exceptional
porter
one
of
my
favourites
highly
recommended
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
samuel
smith
nonic
pint
glass
a
dark
caramel
brown
with
a
small
1in
head
that
dissolves
rather
quickly
a
little
too
fast
for
my
liking
you
immediatley
smell
the
malt
along
with
some
mild
hops
and
after
that
a
little
bit
of
a
fruit
kick
very
pleasing
the
taste
at
first
is
somewhat
sweet
with
just
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
a
very
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
high
drinkability
because
of
the
low
alcohol
content
silky
smooth
mouth
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
beer
here
pours
a
true
black
you
may
be
able
to
coax
i
ruby
hint
out
of
it
in
the
light
but
youd
have
to
try
hard
beefy
tan
head
which
fades
leaving
light
lacing
smell
is
the
only
real
downpoint
here
as
it
has
some
light
coffee
notes
but
nothing
that
really
wets
the
palate
however
this
beer
is
for
drinking
and
what
a
wonderful
drinking
beer
it
is
silky
chocalate
milk
feel
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
zesty
sparkle
as
you
swallow
which
compliments
the
smoothness
perfectly
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
wholesome
for
a
heavy
beer
this
sure
goes
down
fast
a
benchmark
with
which
to
judge
other
porters
d
quite
good
drinkability
first
real
cold
night
here
in
a
long
while
about
16
degrees
f
with
a
wind
chill
in
the
single
digits
this
beer
just
seems
perfect
for
the
weather
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
not
overthetop
with
blow
you
away
hops
but
is
a
bit
to
the
malty
side
would
i
want
another
you
bet
could
i
drink
these
all
night
probably
not
just
too
filling
but
then
again
being
responsible
and
drinking
in
moderation
is
part
of
beer
advocacy
is
it
not
respect
beer
especially
this
beer
highly
recommended
must
try
this
is
a
very
rich
and
flavorful
porter
that
fairly
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
slight
but
persistent
carbonation
i
was
done
after
one
bottle
but
i
could
see
myself
having
another
had
i
not
had
this
right
after
a
meal
a
very
nice
porter
and
imo
one
of
the
best
d
the
odd
plastic
taste
is
offputting
and
while
the
smell
is
fantastic
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
little
more
than
average
this
is
a
brew
i
might
be
interested
in
revisiting
sometime
but
until
then
it
wont
be
a
staple
has
a
nice
bitterness
that
makes
this
beer
awesome
on
the
palate
and
highly
drinkable
once
again
sam
smith
proves
why
they
are
a
top
5
brewery
in
my
opinion
the
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
little
more
than
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
left
fine
lacing
down
the
glass
the
beers
aroma
had
hints
of
coffee
chocalate
and
some
fruitiness
as
well
the
flavor
was
off
the
charts
and
a
true
treat
taddy
porters
flavor
fit
its
ominous
dark
color
with
plenty
of
roasted
malt
flavor
along
some
chocalate
the
beer
finished
a
smokey
caramel
flavor
that
road
through
the
end
of
each
sip
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
super
drinkable
if
only
a
little
cheaper
of
available
in
greater
quantites
at
least
here
in
my
area
a
true
treat
and
i
imagine
something
of
a
classic
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
very
small
creamy
light
tan
head
smells
of
very
deep
rich
roasted
chocolate
malt
oatmeal
cookie
light
coffee
earthy
grassy
and
lightly
herbal
with
a
little
cherry
and
oak
dear
god
this
tastes
good
huge
toasted
malts
giving
a
hefty
wallop
of
bittersweet
chocolate
followed
then
by
toffee
oak
and
molasses
it
really
turns
sweet
as
it
heads
toward
the
finish
the
finish
is
quite
long
and
while
the
big
malt
flavor
linger
to
the
end
theyre
accompanied
by
a
light
citrus
bitterness
that
add
balance
crispness
and
closure
this
porter
is
fullbodied
and
slightly
watery
with
very
low
carbonation
wow
was
this
a
great
beer
forget
the
desert
just
give
me
a
bottle
of
this
after
dinner
sure
this
beer
is
a
bit
pricey
but
ill
be
getting
a
bottle
of
this
from
time
to
time
for
sure
a
truly
amazing
porter
definitely
a
beer
to
be
savored
a
very
very
good
beer
drinkability
is
huge
im
buying
2
or
3
at
a
time
from
now
on
full
bodied
and
rich
throughout
its
a
darn
same
its
on
the
expensive
side

it
would
make
a
good
session
brew
if
better
priced
drinkability
judging
from
the
other
ratings
i
was
inclined
to
mark
my
scores
up
a
notch
but
i
wouldnt
be
honest
to
this
bottle
if
i
did
that
worth
taking
another
try
in
the
future
i
was
put
off
by
some
of
the
sour
elements
in
this
sample
this
was
a
disappointing
brew
i
am
hoping
i
just
got
a
bad
one
i
have
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
sammy
smiths
so
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
more
maybe
not
for
everybody
but
for
those
who
like
a
rich
malt
flavor
this
is
definitely
recommended
the
alcohol
flavors
are
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
to
have
too
many
of
these
nevertheless
i
find
the
beer
to
be
very
enjoyable
just
in
moderation
this
is
the
first
english
porter
ive
tried
and
i
cant
say
i
was
terribly
impressed
the
bottle
may
have
been
off
a
bit
as
there
was
a
decidedly
sour
aftertaste
that
may
not
be
typical
all
in
all
not
a
terrible
beer
i
wouldnt
decline
it
if
free
but
can
find
better
brews
for
3
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
see
if
the
sour
flavor
remains
or
if
i
simply
had
bad
luck
overall
comments
boy
i
hope
i
get
the
chance
to
taste
this
fresh
one
day

i
think
id
have
a
much
higher
opinion
of
it
as
it
is
im
disappointed
opinion
i
really
like
this
beer
and
it
stands
out
among
the
rest
there
is
a
much
smoother
and
richer
flavor
here
as
compared
to
just
about
any
other
porter
the
british
malts
do
a
lot
for
this
style
and
the
processes
at
sam
smiths
make
this
a
really
smooth
and
almost
creamy
tasting
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
a
nice
porter
no
suprises
but
a
solid
porter
for
sure
notes
sole

smell
is
subdued
malty
a
little
fruity
maybe
taste
is
also
less
robust
than
i
would
have
imagined
malty
up
front
not
so
much
in
the
roasted
coffee
or
dark
chocolate
i
would
expect
from
a
porter
but
there
is
also
a
hint
of
mint
and
apricot
extremely
sweet
to
taste
and
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
balance
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
are
in
the
nose
very
pleasant
it
is
fairly
bitter
on
the
palate
from
both
the
hops
and
roasted
malts
but
this
is
one
afforded
the
label
a

theres
a

stouts
update
i
had
one
of
these
last
night
and
it
was
terriffic
much
better
thn
the
previous
sample
a
definite
classic
porter
poured
perfect
with
almost
2
fingers
of
head
and
stood
for
quite
a
long
time
plenty
of
carbonation
can
be
seen
and
this
beer
produced
some
of
the
best
lacing
ive
seen
in
a
porter

malty
aroma
with
hints
of
toffee
and
molasses
astrigent
flavor
that
is
strong
with
an
unexpected
strong
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
favorable
since
beer
had
strong
aftertaste
i
expected
much
more
from
the
taste
after
taking
in
the
aromas
and
witnessing
this
beer
dance
quite
drinkable
but
the
astringency
and
fruitiness
could
get
annoying
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
some
of
the
wellknown
stouts
out
there
such
as
youngs
double
chocolate
and
mackesons
it
has
a
bit
more
astringent
flavor
however
and
really
assaults
your
taste
buds
if
you
are
into
strong
dark
beers
this
one
is
worth
a

a

that
i
always
enjoy

makes
it
a

this

a
nice
dark

color
with
a
2

falls
to
a

over

the

nutty

chocolate

a
little

as
well
the

the

i
taste
a

bit

as
well
the
feel
is
moderate
and
as
i
said
dry
on
the
finish
overall
a
nice
brew
sam
smiths
usually
keeps
things
true
a
good
porter
all
around
i
think
it
goes
well
with
just
about
any
meal
and
is
very
refreshing
taddy
porter
is
dark
dark
brown
with
a
goodsized
creamy
head
pretty
good
lacings
around
the
inside
of
my
pint

the
aroma
here
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
strong
rich
chocolate
smells
bombard
my
nose
taste
is
great
too
rich
chocolate
flavors
control
my
palate
a
light
coffee
taste
is
noticed
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
which
complements
the
taste
nicely
this
is
great
im
wondering
if
itd
be
even
better
without
the
clear
glass
bottle
first
of
all
the
damn
gold
leaf
that
covers
the
cap
needs
to
goits
a
real
pain
in

just
an
ok
beer
no

date
so
i
dont
know
how
old
this
is
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
was
let
down
overall
a
truly
magnificent
and
drinkable
porter
yet
again
the
samuel
smith
brewery
has
impressed
me
the
dark
appearance
of
this
porter
makes
you
think
that
it
will
be
a
challenge
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
but
it
is
quite
light
and
goes
down
very
easy
due
to
the
excellent
balance
of
flavours
the
taste
is
quite
the
same
chocolate
with
hints
of
coffee
fruity
tastes
as
well
with
a
nice
dry
like
finish
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
stays
to
cover
the
beer
but
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
dark
malts
and
coffee
mostly
the
flavor
is
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
sweetness
of
fruits
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
could
be
a
little
thicker
in
the
mouthfeel
damn
fine
beer
pours
a
dark
black
with
ruby
streaks
the
mocha
tan
head
is
fabulous
the
smell
is
strong
of
cappucino
and
dark
fire
roasted
chocolate
a
nice
fluffy
marshmellow
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
pine
hops
the
taste
is
great
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
compliment
the
roasted
toffee
and
marshmellows
hints
of
roasted
nuts
linger
very
nice
i
think
this
was
the
first
porter
i
ever
tried
and
its
the
standard
i
set
for
porters
several
years
ago
it
was
fairly
common
to
find
lightstruck
bottles
but
most
sam
smith
products
seem
to
move
off
the
shelves
a
lot
quicker
these
days
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
porters
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
that
is
really
closer
to
black
nice
brownish
tan
head
that
becomes
thin
but
never
really
goes
away
smell
is
of
darkly
roasted
coffee
the
taste
is
bittersweet
cocoa
and
coffee
and
perhaps
a
not
so
sweet
fruit
although
i
cant
seem
to
put
my
finger
on
it
the
mouthfell
is
great
very
smooth
and
creamy
without
feeling
thick
or
sticky
the
drinkability
is
good
you
could
defintely
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
very
tasty
not
too
high
in
alcohol
and
very
smooth
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
this
the
sams
smith
and
adams
were
basically
my
introduction
to
the
world
of
craft
brews
i
first
had
the
taddy
on
my
21st
birthday
and
have
revisited
it
several
times
since
well
onto
the
review
pours
a
super
deep
brown
chocolatey
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
has
good
retention
heavy
notes
of
nut
chocolate
and
coffee
blend
excellently
taste
is
super
roasty
chocolate
followed
by
a
slight
roasted
malt
bitterness
pleasant
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thinner
than
i
wouldve
liked
but
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
cornerstone
of
my
growing
appreciation
for
beer
pours
out
a
near
black
with
some
crimson
highlights
big
tan
head
that
rose
and
fell
good
roasty
character
to
it
cookie
dough
sweet
notes
with
some
vanilla
and
cocoa
figgy
pudding
and
grapey
aromas
too
very
easy
to
drink
not
too
overpowering
with
its
maltiness
just
about
enough
to
give
at
rich
smoothness
final
thought
this
is
a
step
down
from
the
other
4
sammy
smith
beers
ive
had
despite
that
its
still
a
solid
beer
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
kind
of
a
brown
head
creamy
looking
smells
a
little
like
chocolate
and
caramel
candy
the
flavor
is
a
little
chocolate
a
little
like
starbucks
burnt
coffee
the
feel
on
the
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
and
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
smooth
some
hop
bitterness
results
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
porter
i
have
to
say
especially
considering
that
its
in
a
clear
bottle
a
great
drinking
beer
easy
to
quaff
all
day
and
at
just
5
no
problems
downing
several
550ml
bottles
pours
with
an
anvil
of
head
a
solid
mass
of
sandy
khaki
foam
with
milkshake
thickness
that
can
literally
be
scooped
and
shaped
with
a
finger
awesome
each
sip
leaves
a
chunky
stratum
of
lace
beer
is
a
sheen
of
mahogany
blackness
with
merlotcolored
highlights
luxurious
aromas
of
fudgy
chocolate
brownies
heady
dark
caramel
creams
chocolate
chip
cheesecake
and
puff
pastries
flaking
apart
in
drawn
butter
are
interwoven
by
vinous
sweet
sherry
tones
in
a
dank
moist
and
cakey
nosefeel
big
sweet
tastes
of
brown
sugartinged
molasses
roll
into
the
midpalate
developing
body
of
dark
chocolate
and
huge
crystals
of
toffee
and
butter
second
half
of
the
palate
rounds
out
into
bitter
almonds
pipe
tobacco
and
a
finish
of
old
dry
leather
a
slight
acidity
at
the
sides
of
the
mouth
is
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
a
5
its
that
close
lightly
dextrinous
mouthfeel
as
of
melted
chocolate
bars
arcs
across
the
tongue
in
a
parabola
of
sweet
soft
and
bitter
drinkable
i
mean
come
on
less
affable
but
more
distinguished
than
its
cousin
from
fullers
these
are
easily
locked
in
a
tie
for
the
best
porters
i
have
ever
tasted
just
gorgeous
a
straightforward
and
undertstated
real
and
earthy
porter
molasses
bit
of
fig
smooth
creamy
roast
and
chocolate
bitter
but
smooth
aftertaste
lingering
roast
and
vanilla
aroma
and
taste
of
the
powders
some
wood
smokiness
thanks
irondjinn
for
the
sample
overall
unlike
any
porter
ive
tried
and
by
far
the
best
very
good
smooth
flavor
already
a
classic
in
my
book
overall
impression
sigh
once
again
im
just
not
a
porter
fan
this
is
a
beer
of
obvious
craftsmanship
and
it
hits
all
the
marks
one
could
look
for
in
a
porter
if
this
is
your
style
this
is
your
beer
if
you
havent
had
many
porters
you
owe
yourself
a
good
calibration
with
this
one
if
you
are
like
me
and
just
dont
care
for
porters
try
an
alaskan
smoked
porter
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
see
one
and
this
one
just
to
be
sure
a
truly
exceptional
beer
just
a
side
note
why
do
really
good
breweries
like
sam
smiths
wychwood
and
marstons
use
clear
bottles
im
sure
it
affects
the
quality
of
their
products
to
some
extent
550ml
gold
foil
topped
clear
bottle
sans
freshness
dating
pours
a
very
dark
rubytinged
blackness
with
a
voluminous
tan
head
that
persists
forever
and
leaves
lace
sheets
on
the
glass
aromas
are
very
muted
and
tough
to
pick
out
even
when
warmed
to
near
room
temperature
whiffs
of
chocolate
caramel
vanilla
and
even
some
smoked
dark
fruit
are
noted
flavor
is
not
a
robust
as
id
expected
perhaps
i
am
unfairly
judging
this
style
the
first
english
porter
ive
sampled
but
it
just
didnt
strike
me
as
that
tasty
theres
the
usual
suspects
of
choclate
some
cocoa
powder
a
dash
of
bittering
hops
and
some
caramel
but
nothing
astounding
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thinner
side
as
well
drinkable
but
not
like
other
porters
ive
had
how
can
beer
like
this
come
from
a
clear
bottle
and
be
great
all
of
the
time
this
poured
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
just
slight
ruby
highlights
nice
tan
head
that
left
a
fair
amount
of
lace
smells
are
chocolate
maybe
with
a
slight
hint
of
licorice
taste
is
a
nice
roasty
maly
with
some
buttery
flavors
fairly
dry
at
the
end
with
minimal
bitterness
slights
hints
of
coffee
medium
body
with
nearly
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
so
very
easy
to
drink
what
a
classic
it
had
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
it
will
not
be
nearly
as
long
before
i
have
it
again
as
usual
for
samuel
smiths
this
is
one
expensive
4
pack
however
this
beer
is
a
treat
i
shared
this
with
a
friend
many
years
ago
for
the
first
time
and
as
i
grow
a
greater
appeciation
for
this
beer
the
more
i
have
it
excellent
beer
what
a
jewel
a
very
good
porter
not
quite
up
there
with
the
baltics
like
sinebyrchoff
other
than
the
price
this
is
one
very
drinkable
beer
should
go
well
with
pork
tenderloin
and
ribeye
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
and
with
a
very
chewy
hoppiness
lasting
in
the
mouth
a
very
good
beer
a
damn
good
porter
and
a
fantastic
beer
drinkabilityoverall
at
5abv
and
great
taste
and
texture
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
very
good
i
dont
know
what
everyone
else
is
drinking
these
days
but
for
me
right
now
this
is
one
of
the
premier
beers
in
my
rotation
sammy
smiths
only
come
into
my
solar
system
on
rare
occasions
and
while
its
here
im
drinking
effusively
from
that
fountain
and
the
taddy
porter
is
one
thats
demanded
my
respect
and
drinking
time
pours
a
jet
blackbrown
with
a
tanbrown
head
that
begins
at
about
1
and
then
settles
somewhat
nice
head
retention
for
this
beer
type
aroma
roasty
malty
and
slightly
smoky
a
little
chocolate
flavor
is
not
as
strong
as
you
would
think
by
looking
at
it
nice
and
malty
with
strong
reminders
of
sweet
german
black
bread
aroma
profiles
also
follow
through
into
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thin
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
good
enough
beer
for
a
session
and
isnt
too
strong
so
id
say
its
decently
drinkable
ill
have
it
now
and
again
even
though
it
isnt
my
favorite
porter
this
is
a
wellmade
and
complex
porter
but
i
cant
take
the
bitterness
at
the
end
i
get
this
beer
but
its
not
for
me
big
tan
noisy
active
head
collapses
doughily
black
beer
with
garnet
highlights
one
or
two
spots
of
lacing
toffee
molasses
in
the
tangy
sweet
creamy
nose
and
front
sweet
creamy
molasses
in
the
light
middle
finishes
dry
sourish
with
a
little
coffee
and
nice
bitterness
coffee
aftertaste
this
is
a
nice
light
porter
very
good
the
famous
taddy
porter
deserves
its
fame
its
classic
and
its
damn
good
attractive
appearance
subdued
nose
delicious
flavor
medium
body
highly
drinkable
sounds
like
a
winner
to
me
exceedingly
drinkable
brew
tasty
with
no
harshness
and
a
moderate
alcohol
content
notes
my
first
porter
even
though
i
love
stouts
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
dn
a
nice
intro
to
the
world
of
porters
max
ds
hot
dogs
recommended
this
one
im
glad
i
listened
to
him
tasty
complex
and
a
really
nice
beer
pours
out
extremely
dark
almost
black
nice
red
tint
when
held
to
the
light
decent
off
white
head
looks
tastey
aromas
are
rich
coffee
and
toffee
dark
malt
dark
chocolate
light
hopping
nice
smooth
in
the
mouth
has
good
body
a
hefty
brew
but
not
overly
so
flavors
are
much
like
the
nose
with
a
def
semi
sweetdark
chocolate
flavor
some
sweeter
toffee
like
notes
come
in
as
well
a
small
but
balanced
hop
bitterness
seems
to
even
things
out
and
it
finishes
with
a
light
coffee
aftertaste
pretty
damn
drinkable
there
are
better
porters
out
there
imo
but
this
is
still
a
top
notch
brew
that
deserves
the
respect
it
seems
to
get
high
five
sammy
smith
finish
is
warm
with
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
heavy
like
a
good
porter
should
be
and
the
drinkability
is
great
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
lives
up
to
its
reputation
lets
face
it
its
a
legend
and
it
is
damned
good
that
said
its
not
tremendous
but
still
as
a
longtime
standard
it
is
a
classic
it
has
the
rich
earthy
elements
you
want
in
a
porter
in
a
nice
balance
strong
across
the
board
its
just
what
you
expect
and
drinking
another
is
easy
enjoyable
and
very
likely
its
maybe
not
as
big
as
many
of
its
american
brethren
but
it
is
faithful
to
the
style
and
it
goes
down
smooth
its
a
trusty
beer
to
turn
to
when
you
want
to
get
down
to
basics
maybe
the
clear
bottle
had
encouraged
some
ill
flavors
to
develop
but
i
wasnt
as
impressed
by
this
beer
as
i
had
hoped
to
be
the
appearance
was
wonderful
it
was
dark
with
good
head
retention
it
smelled
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavors
began
with
a
nice
medley
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
the
long
finish
passed
through
some
rougher
territory
almost
whiskey
alcohol
notes
and
some
buttery
flavors
it
was
a
complex
porter
but
not
exactly
ideal
eh
i
would
say
go
for
the
oatmeal
stout
but
you
should
at
least
try
this
for
the
sake
of
trying
it
taste
is
mildly
chocolate
with
an
aftertaste
of
coffee
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
excellent
beer
and
definitely
one
of
my
personal
favorites
seldom
do
i
rave
i
can
only
hope
my
ancestors
has
access
to
beer
this
good
despite
this
beers
mildness
something
reminded
me
of
stone
imperial
stout
not
intensity
but
in
livelyness
maybe
it
was
the
type
of
hops
not
amount
or
perhaps
just
that
both
of
these
beers
sing
to
me
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
big
tan
head
smells
of
caramel
chocolate
and
spicy
maybe
clove
the
smell
is
great
there
are
caramel
and
slight
spice
taste
and
small
sweetness
to
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
much
ligther
than
anticipated
and
quite
unlike
its
heavy
scent
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
and
very
drinkable
the
taddy
porter
i
love
the
appearance
on
this
beer
pours
out
a
very
dark
brown
close
to
black
as
it
can
get
with
a
hint
of
ruby
shade
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
consisted
of
malts
caramel
some
plums
mixed
in
as
well
taste
consisted
of
some
coffee
and
some
roasted
flavors
some
of
that
caramel
and
plum
comes
into
play
as
well
its
balanced
so
well
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
goes
down
very
nicely
only
gripe
is
that
its
some
damn
expensive
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
most
of
the
time
john
its
just
so
easy
to
drink
the
rasins
in
the
nose
blend
very
well
with
the
overall
flow
of
this
beer
one
of
my
favorite
porters
now
but
it
is
much
different
from
my
other
favorites
as
the
particularly
fruity
nose
and
taste
set
it
apart
from
the
others
i
want
to
eat
a
steak
and
drink
this
at
the
same
time
dark
mollasses
brown
and
black
with
a
great
deal
of
thick
reddish
brown
head
and
stringy
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
rich
with
many
nuances
it
is
somewhat
similar
to
samuel
smiths
other
beer
oatmeal
stout
both
in
aroma
and
taste
the
difference
is
that
oatmeal
stout
is
much
sweeter
coffee
chocolate
subtle
fruits
vanilla
cream
raisins
and
even
slight
spicy
notes
greet
the
nose
the
aroma
even
carries
some
smells
more
common
in
fruit
brandies
the
smell
to
me
is
the
outstanding
characteristic
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
balanced
well
sweet
yet
dry
initially
it
has
a
crisp
sweet
syrup
flavour
but
gives
way
to
a
coffeelike
dryness
in
the
finish
and
the
middle
is
where
you
taste
the
medium
alcohol
presence
there
seems
to
be
a
slight
oak
taste
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
yes
definite
wood
flavours
slowly
reveal
themselves
upon
subsequent
sips
i
sense
a
strong
graininess
on
the
palate
almost
as
if
there
are
coffee
grains
in
the
beer
and
it
adds
delightfully
to
the
character
of
the
brew
the
taste
lingers
on
the
mouth
for
quite
some
while
which
makes
this
a
highly
drinkable
and
sociable
beer
relax
after
dinner
with
one
slowly
sipping
and
savouring
as
a
classic
this
is
not
meant
to
be
consumed
rapidly
excellent
porter
my
new
favorite
definitely
something
to
try
near
black
in
color
with
a
large
puffy
tan
head
and
good
lacing
smell
is
burnt
malt
and
chocolatebutterscotch
and
some
alchohol
taste
is
similar
malty
with
some
chocolate
butterscotch
and
brown
sugar
tastes
there
is
some
bitterness
i
assume
it
comes
from
black
malts
but
hops
are
also
distinguishable
but
regardless
of
what
causes
it
the
bitterness
is
very
overshadowed
by
the
malty
brown
sugarchocolate
flavors
mouthfeel
is
right
full
but
not
rich
a
good
beer
although
quite
expensive
served
in
a
clear
glass
12
oz
bottle
at
the
alchemist
and
the
barrister
in
princeton
nj
the
appearance
was
excellent
dark
brown
with
a
tanoffwhite
medium
head
nice
lacing
that
clung
to
the
side
of
the
glass
in
patterns
that
looked
to
be
made
by
a
spider
spinning
a
web
in
zero
gravity
the
smell
was
good
toasted
malt
and
coffee
but
the
taste
was
where
this
beer
really
shined
toasted
burnt
malts
dark
espresso
and
buttery
toffee
especially
the
nutty
buttery
toffee
flavors
amazing
very
well
balanced
with
the
hops
i
havent
been
this
pleasantly
surprised
in
a
while
something
about
that
toffee
flavor
just
got
me
i
was
in
love
and
i
rarely
drink
porters
mouthfeel
was
great
not
too
carbonated
but
very
plush
and
satisfying
drinkability
was
excellent
as
well
if
i
wasnt
driving
i
would
have
certainly
had
a
few
this
is
defiantly
going
in
my
fridge
next
time
i
make
a
run
a
delicious
porter
from
sam
smith
especially
for
those
who
are
fans
of
the
very
dry
hoppy
finished
porters
quite
good
and
certainly
one
that
id
look
for
again
in
the
future
a
good
beer
and
an
excellent
valentines
gift
dark
brown
with
dark
red
tints
and
a
thick
frothy
head
there
is
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
very
sublte
but
good
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
burnt
taste
of
malts
and
slight
hints
of
coffee
and
toffee
sweet
chocolate
taste
with
very
smooth
very
rich
taste
of
roasted
malts
the
aftertaste
is
creamy
and
outstanding
quite
enjoyable
great
blend
of
malts
poured
a
graham
cracker
brown
color
into
my
glass
with
a
medium
head
that
laced
pretty
well
smelled
of
coffee
carmels
and
bitter
chocolates
tastes
hits
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
alcohol
and
a
fruit
surprise
at
the
finish
i
say
surprise
because
throughout
the
duration
of
this
beer
i
never
could
nail
what
fruit
or
spice
i
was
tasting
to
get
this
effect
the
body
was
nice
and
thick
and
id
drink
this
beer
again
especially
with
a
steak
and
potatos
kind
of
meal
the
pour
creates
a
deep
dark
brown
color
a
minimal
head
of
beige
is
erected
staying
power
is
not
good
slight
aroma
of
cocoa
and
java
and
european
malts
the
flavor
is
not
really
on
its
not
horrible
but
its
just
a
little
bland
and
perhaps
a
little
light
struck
bland
maltiness
dominates
and
is
accentuated
by
a
slight
sourness
and
some
light
roasted
tones
this
is
just
not
a
good
porter
pours
an
opaque
deep
dark
brown
with
a
modest
tan
head
lacing
had
a
smooth
silky
appearance
as
it
left
sheets
down
the
glass
aroma
and
taste
surprised
me
with
a
complexity
that
was
somewhat
unique
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
were
dominant
with
earthiness
smokiness
and
black
walnut
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
smooth
carbonation
just
barely
adequate
taste
was
much
like
the
nose
but
with
some
interesting
twists
that
made
for
one
of
the
best
tasting
dark
beers
ive
ever
tried
theres
definitely
a
hint
of
cherries
in
this
and
the
twang
of
those
funky
english
hops
i
cant
decide
if
its
licorice
or
cinamon
or
some
other
bittersweet
spice
but
theres
something
here
that
melds
perfectly
with
the
chocolately
malts
cherry
fruitiness
and
buttery
walnut
to
produce
an
exceptional
flavor
profile
just
enough
bittering
hops
to
balance
the
many
other
flavors
going
on
in
this
fine
porter
finishes
smooth
and
goes
down
so
fine
high
drinkability
with
the
low
abv
finest
porter
that
ive
sampled
to
date
pours
the
darkest
shade
of
brown
known
to
man
the
head
is
just
as
it
should
be
for
the
stylenot
overwhelmingyet
always
hanging
in
a
bit
more
lace
would
be
nice
though
aromatics
are
of
creamy
bittersweet
chocolatestrong
black
coffee
and
black
licorice
the
roast
is
quite
dark
smooth
and
very
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
mild
fruityness
bitter
coffee
and
more
black
licorice
the
bitter
is
quite
unique
and
appreciated
this
is
a
tasty
porter
that
i
will
be
sure
to
pair
with
fod
upon
the
next
visit
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety

good
drinkability
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
deep
dark
cocoa
brownblack
with
hints
of
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
it
was
clear
and
decently
carbonated
the
head
that
was
produced
was
thick
and
very
dense
beige
colored
and
long
lasting
the
lace
that
was
formed
was
thick
and
sheety
near
the
top
slowly
broke
apart
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
fairly
simple
which
is
nice
smells
of
coffees
chocolate
and
some
rich
dark
malt
classic
the
tastes
that
i
experienced
were
of
coffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
in
the
beginning
then
slowly
caramel
notes
came
forth
then
dark
malts
then
as
it
finished
more
combo
of
coffee
chocolate
and
hints
of
dark
fruits
as
it
ended
the
aftertaste
was
on
the
dry
side
with
combined
flavors
of
malt
and
coffee
the
body
was
medium
this
is
a
classic
beer
well
represents
its
style
creamy
rich
dry
hints
of
bitter
and
fruit
make
this
beer
worth
the
try
and
imo
would
get
again
i
was
all
excited
to
get
this
one
home
i
like
sam
smiths
beer
a
lot
i
expect
great
things
pours
a
deep
lack
colour
with
a
rich
browntan
head
the
receeds
into
a
brown
lace
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
rather
soft
for
a
porter
roasted
malts
with
a
feel
of
coffee
somewhat
bittersweet
this
is
average
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
guess
i
just
got
my
hopes
up
too
high
but
it
wasnt
bad
i
was
expecting
a
pefrect
5
i
have
a
real
mix
of
thougts
on
this
beer
it
looked
exceptional
but
the
strong
tastes
of
this
style
arent
what
im
looking
for
if
i
were
to
drink
a
porter
im
sure
this
would
be
my
choice
many
of
the
similar
qualities
that
make
samuel
smiths
pale
ales
delightful
are
present
here
however
i
see
this
being
a
rare
situation
the
taste
is
exceptional
it
is
a
smooth
and
rounded
blend
of
roasty
malts
cane
sugars
and
huge
malts
dont
look
for
a
hop
prescence
here
this
is
a
maltyporterheads
delight
beer
was
in
a
great
looking
clear
bottle
normal
for
samuel
smith
550
ml
a
very
dark
porter
black
with
a
tan
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
smell
was
not
good
when
cold
but
as
it
warmed
it
became
sublime
wow
the
aroma
would
fare
well
against
my
favorite
dark
belgians
sure
the
dark
chocolate
is
there
in
good
balance
with
roasted
coffee
beans
but
the
great
parts
are
the
esters
and
the
hops
the
dark
cherries
meld
perfectly
with
the
earthy
hops
unfortunately
i
find
the
flavor
to
be
a
letdown
after
such
an
aroma
it
is
rather
bland
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
acidic
twinge
and
butteriness
at
the
end
not
bad
but
not
anything
special
the
carbonation
feels
a
little
rough
on
the
tongue
and
the
body
is
thin
i
think
i
pick
up
some
higherfusel
alcohols
i
have
a
feeling
this
beer
would
be
devastatingly
good
on
cask
but
as
far
as
out
of
a
bottle
it
is
just
above
average
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
is
decent
but
a
bit
on
the
dark
side
it
is
full
of
roasted
and
black
malts
a
hearty
porter
the
taste
is
good
it
has
an
elevated
abv
taste
with
black
malt
flavor
and
a
creamy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
porter
definately
not
my
favorite
i
just
cant
get
into
these
super
black
porters
when
poured
it
was
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
medium
amout
of
tan
foam
and
nice
lace
from
start
to
finish
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
is
what
first
filled
the
nose
and
was
very
pleasant
the
taste
was
a
creamy
delight
with
the
flavor
of
roasted
barley
malts
and
a
nice
balance
of
simi
sweet
chocolate
on
the
finish
overall
this
porter
was
full
in
body
and
packed
with
flavor
intense
dry
tangy
character
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
this
one
was
instantly
one
of
my
favourites
i
love
this
style
and
this
one
in
particular
was
no
exception
poured
quite
dark
somewhere
between
coffee
and
old
motor
oil
brown
head
dissolves
quickly
smells
almost
like
it
tastes
smoothness
due
in
part
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
as
there
is
almost
none
to
speak
of
taste
is
very
pronounced
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
quite
malty
indeed
i
detect
a
bit
of
nutiness
perhaps
an
almond
like
flavour
as
well
the
only
reason
i
gave
drinkability
40
as
oppossed
to
45
is
because
this
is
a
bit
heavy
and
i
can
easily
see
where
after
3
of
these
keep
in
mind
im
drinking
the
550
litre
size
one
would
certainly
have
his
or
her
fill
of
this
wonderful
brew
at
least
for
a
while
nevertheless
this
is
marvelous
stuff
very
dark
brown
body
almost
black
with
a
brown
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
smell
was
complex
but
not
that
great
raisins
almonds
some
coffee
some
chocolate
and
caramel
smokey
and
a
little
wine
like
aroma
taste
was
of
coffee
licorice
and
chocolate
big
coffee
aftertaste
tasted
slightly
stronger
than
5
0
good
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
end
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
and
a
little
sticky
poured
from
a
clear
12
oz
bottle
its
dark
brown
with
a
trace
of
cherry
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
initially
fat
head
fades
quickly
but
never
disappears
completely
in
addition
to
the
expected
coffee
aromas
it
presented
a
bit
of
a
winey
smell
that
was
surprising
but
not
unpleasant
the
taste
is
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
mix
of
coffee
hints
of
chocolate
and
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
drinkability
this
is
an
allday
beer
drinkability
i
can
drink
this
all
night
long
leaves
you
begging
for
more
and
more
and
more
the
perfect
blend
of
flavor
and
kick
doesnt
have
any
of
the
bitterness
or
harshness
that
many
bad
porters
have
yes
there
is
some
rather
large
grapefruit
at
the
nose
i
didnt
pick
up
as
much
sweetness
in
the
taste
this
time
around
but
i
got
some
good
albeit
light
brown
sugar
and
a
twang
of
rising
yeast
its
definitely
a
solid
medium
in
the
body
and
was
a
little
too
clumsy
to
be
called
a
session
brew
im
adjusting
the
scores
a
little
bit
but
i
think
ultimately
this
is
a
sub4
0
beer
that
barely
avoids
my
would
buy
again
recommendation
almost
dead
blackwith
some
deep
brown
visible
when
held
up
to
a
light
thick
frothy
dark
beige
head
with
a
good
lace
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
spice
mix
nicely
with
the
yeasts
and
malt
the
taste
is
very
light
with
coffee
and
chocolate
again
it
actually
taste
alot
like
a
whete
beer
or
lager
where
the
malts
whetes
and
a
little
hops
are
more
present
the
malted
grains
prevail
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
it
becomes
less
noticible
and
as
you
continue
to
drink
it
the
substance
becomes
more
evident
the
carbonation
is
perfect
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
very
good
but
i
was
slightly
dissapointed
because
it
wasnt
as
complex
as
i
expected
and
was
more
mellow
than
i
anticipated
as
well
the
flavors
could
stand
to
be
kicked
up
a
few
notches
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
good
porter
and
another
good
beer
from
sam
smith
very
smooth
nicely
balanced
on
the
light
side
of
medium
very
creamy
and
extremely
drinkable
another
winner
from
samuel
smith
i
love
the
appearancea
deep
beckoning
ebony
just
clear
enough
to
show
tints
of
blood
red
hue
topped
off
by
a
lacy
sticky
light
chocolate
head
the
aroma
is
a
combination
first
of
a
garden
in
early
fall
after
the
harvest
when
the
dirt
has
been
uprooted
mixed
with
burning
maples
in
the
air
the
taste
is
smooth
smooth
smooth
and
theres
a
balanced
floralcoffeechocolate
maltiness
this
ale
has
a
silky
mouthfeel
which
is
just
a
tad
pardon
the
pun
thin
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
i
have
only
one
bottle
and
it
is
after
all
a
week
night
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
does
seem
however
and
thankfully
that
ss
imperial
stout
actually
benefits
from
this
quality
there
they
stepped
up
the
hops
to
accomodate
there
thick
sweet
beers
i
love
this
beer
this
is
a
great
offering
from
samual
smiths
taddy
porter
has
a
great
balance
and
wonderful
drinkability
that
makes
this
one
of
the
top
porters
ive
had
worth
every
penny
and
worth
having
at
the
ready
in
my
fridge
overall
simple
awesome
this
definitely
beats
out
the
anchor
porter
my
previous
favorite
a
variety
of
flavors
and
an
excellent
mouthfeel
make
this
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
i
actually
prefer
it
to
the
imperial
stout
seek
this
one
out
a
fine
porter
that
comes
with
my
highest
recomendations
well
rounded
easy
drinking
porter
the
flavor
is
just
as
subtle
pretending
at
first
to
be
too
light
but
gaining
strength
as
it
is
allowed
to
develop
after
a
while
the
very
fine
subtleties
of
this
brew
begin
to
impress
the
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
having
very
light
carbonation
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
very
disappointing
to
say
the
least
first
off
let
me
ask
the
question
why
does
samuel
smith
continue
to
use
clear
bottles
without
a
doubt
it
effects
the
flavor
dark
brownblack
with
a
tan
head
not
a
very
strong
nose
smells
lightly
of
buttery
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
is
rather
flat
and
not
what
i
expected
coffee
and
slightly
acidic
although
it
has
a
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
call
me
crazy
but
i
just
didnt
care
for
this
too
much
poured
very
darkhad
a
plum
raisin
chocolate
cake
type
of
a
roma
nice
cocoay
first
taste
slft
little
bit
of
a
mocha
backtaste
seems
more
carbonated
then
other
porters
ive
tried
but
it
seem
that
the
way
it
is
with
all
brews
from
this
brewery
no
heavy
bitter
alcohol
taste
that
i
find
unattractive
with
other
porters
probaly
the
best
porter
ive
had
poured
from
a
12
oz
clear
bottle
with
gold
foil
around
the
cap
very
dark
beer
almost
absorbs
light
the
pour
produced
a
light
brown
fluffy
head
that
slowly
shrank
to
a
thin
layer
covering
the
top
of
the
beer
and
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
mostly
of
roasted
grains
the
beer
feels
light
and
bubbly
as
it
rolls
accross
my
tongue
the
taste
is
nothing
extraordinary
smooth
roasted
malts
on
the
way
down
a
very
slight
coffee
kind
of
aftertaste
on
the
back
of
the
throat
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
you
might
want
to
find
a
local
beer
with
similar
quality
for
a
few
bucks
cheaper
dark
black
color
medium

aroma

the
color
is
the
deepest
ruby
you
can
get
before
it
becomes
opaque
the
head
is
herculean
in
size
with
a
spumescent
texture
the
color
a
beauteous
light
tan
and
after
decomposition
a
thick
and
chunky
sheet
of
lace
clings
mightily
to
the
glass
the
aroma
of
lightly
toasted
grains
and
sweet
malt
dominate
the
nose
crisp
and
fresh
with
a
malt
laden
and
sweet
start
the

is
moderate
in
its
feel
to
the

crisply

personable
in

with

quite
dry

i
consume
with
much
gusto
on
a
regular
basis
appearance
deep
ruby
brown
with
an
almost
purple
haze
ha
ha
purple
haze
well
anyway
it
also
has
a
tan
brown
moccha
color
to
the
massive
sized
head
leaving
definite
clear
rings
of
lacing
to
it
aroma
slight
fruity
approach
mixture
of
hops
in
there
to
balance
out
the
semi
smoked
deep
roasted
malts
that
provide
chocolate
and
some
coffe
tones
very
nice
taste
definitely
an
acquired
bitterness
with
a
pleasant
array
of
rolling
sharp
sweet

blended
with
the
coffe
and
chocolae
available
along
with
a
sharp
ale
yeast
driven
fruitiness
mouthfeel
a
tad
thin
haha
get
it
but
really
its
a
bit
light
for
my
tases
just
doesnt
deliver
the
texture
and
body
i
am
searching
for
in
a
porter
drinkability
dont
worry
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
representations
of
any
porter
i
have
sipped
upon
sometimes
the
price
may
keep
you
from
partaking
but
thats
merchant
du
vins
fault
not
ol
sam
smiths
right
overall
a
good
beer
i
wonder
if
it
is
fresh
i
would
like
to
try
another
bottle
taste
is
complex
dry
up
front
and
sweet
going
down
hints
of
smoked
almonds
and
maple
syrup
very
thick
and
fullbodied
great
looking
beer
and
tastes
nearly
as
good
the
darkest
thickest
porter
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
this
is
the
type
of
brew
that
could
make
me
a
porter
fan
the
beautiful
chocolate
appearance
is
topped
with
a
creamy
head
with
excellent
lacing
smell
hints
of
coffee
and
smoke
but
light
enough
to
be
inviting
taste
was
smooth
with
a
slight
acid
coffee
twinge
very
easy
to
drink
a
damn
nice
brew
the
great
looking
beer
is
almost
completely
opaque
only
when
held
to
the
light
is
there
a
slight
hint
of
ruby
color
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
tops
her
off
leaving
a
nice
lace
trail
in
its
wake
the
scent
coming
out
is
a
nice
chocolate
one
taste
wise
this
is
a
creamy
smooth
porter
with
chocolate
and
coffee
dominating
the
scene
this
is
a
pretty
sweet
drink
worth
your
34
bucks
a
bottle
pours
a
dark
cola
colour
with
a
fairly
nice
tight
head
redolant
with
the
smell
of
malt
with
a
little
smoky
spice
to
it
lovely
malty
dark
brown
sugar
flavours
with
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
it
out
light
enough
in
abv
to
be
a
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
fairly
carbonated
but
not
overly
offensive
overall
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
lovely
flavour
and
low
abv
another
winner
from
sammy
smith
picked
this
up
on
word
that
it
was
exceptionally
tasty
which
it
was
waited
until
steak
and
stout
night
came
around
and
cracked
it
open
poured
nicely
with
a
surprisingly
tight
and
well
formed
head
for
a
bottle
the
just
nearly
black
liquid
looked
somewhat
clear
though
there
was
no
alteration
in
color
as
i
drank
or
held
it
to
different
light
aroma
was
almost
nil
just
a
slight
smoked
peat
smell
taste
followed
up
on
the
smokey
note
with
a
mouth
full
of
darkened
and
dry
malts
a
nice
rich
flavor
that
would
beat
single
malt
any
day
the
beer
had
a
nice
dry
feel
to
it
so
it
followed
up
dinner
quite
nicely
certainly
a
great
beer
in
the
mouth
its
smooth
and
creamy
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
without
a
doubt
enjoy
poured
pretty
much
straight
black
with
some
minor
ruby
highlights
around
the
edge
of
my
glass
nice
size
frothy
tan
head
aroma
is
strong
of
english
hops
almost
a
bit
like
tea
and
caramel
malt
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
although
its
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
any
one
flavor
there
is
definitely
a
burnt
roastyness
the
hops
kind
of
balance
this
out
so
its
not
too
heavy
in
taste
there
is
also
a
very
slight
plum
taste
in
there
really
all
sorts
of
very
delicate
fruits
the
kicker
for
me
is
the
finish
which
is
smooth
buttery
like
most
sammy
smith
ales
good
carbonation
but
it
kind
of
detracts
from
what
would
be
a
velvety
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
so
meaty
this
is
very
drinkable
cant
go
wrong
with
sammy
smith
i
would
say
that
the
only
disappointment
of
this
beer
is
that
it
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
but
somehow
doesnt
have
the
skunky
taste
that
clear
and
green
bottles
give
beer
however
they
do
it
keep
on
doing
it
cause
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
love
the
smoothness
and
quality
of
the
sam
smith
brews
this
one
if
you
are
familiar
with
sam
smith
brews
is
about
what
youd
expect
a
fairly
black
appearance
with
a
thin
creamy
head
a
slight
aroma
of
chocolate
roasty
and
malty
for
the
smell
it
has
a
very
flavorful
taste
with
primarily
chocolate
undertones
this
one
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
palate
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
want
another
great
porter
looks
how
a
porter
should
color
is
right
in
between
a
dark
stout
and
a
brown
ale
tan
head
sits
atop
the
beer
and
doesnt
budge
aroma
is
weak
and
doesnt
let
the
beer
truly
show
itself
this
beer
has
so
many
flavors
that
i
had
trouble
picking
up
on
all
of
them
i
noticed
a
prune
sweetness
up
front
espresso
comes
in
slightly
but
then
backs
out
chocolate
takes
control
shows
itself
in
a
powerful
way
hops
and
an
acidic
quality
are
there
just
before
the
finish
the
finish
is
of
roasted
nuts
and
espresso
and
lingers
for
awhile
quite
a
treat
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
hoppy
surprisingly
long
finish
tongue
tingles
for
many
seconds
after
the
swallow
difficult
to
taste
the
sweetness
the
aroma
would
seem
to
predict
very
refreshing
another
amazing
beer
from
sam
smith
i
definitely
recommend
this
if
you
want
to
familiarize
yourself
with
porters
this
is
the
orginal
super
super
super
complex
rich
taste
very
chocolate
and
cofeelike
without
burning
the
tongue
off
with
acidity
nice
balance
the
only
problem
is
drinkability
but
one
bottle
is
pure
bliss
anyway
pours
a
deep
black
but
i
did
notice
some
slight
red
hues
thru
the
glass
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
not
very
strong
on
this
beer
soome
slight
sweet
rasiny
smell
to
it
the
taste
however
is
bursting
with
complexty
of
flavorsvery
roasted
flavor
with
some
coffee
notesalso
a
lingering
raisiny
sweetness
in
the
finish
a
real
nice
flavorful
portera
true
classic
this
beer
poured
a
tan
head
with
large
sized
bubbles
there
was
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
with
this
beer
and
the
nose
was
that
of
alcohol
i
am
not
a
fan
of
beer
that
has
an
overpowering
strong
coffee
taste
to
it
and
this
beer
however
was
to
my
liking
because
it
did
not
have
an
overpowering
coffee
taste
to
it
in
my
opinion
this
beer
went
down
smooth
and
easy
this
brew
has
an
aroma
of
alcohol
in
it
when
poured
it
yielded
a
very
energetic
light
brown
head
of
large
bubbles
that
formed
a
very
nice
lacing
as
it
receded
down
the
side
of
my
glass
with
a
dark
ruby
brown
almost
opaque
body
it
looks
delicious
as
i
anticipate
my
first
taste
i
am
not
disappointed
initially
it
had
a
very
smooth
taste
then
the
roasted
malt
coffee
finish
hits
not
a
strong
coffee
taste
mind
you
but
there
nonetheless
still
it
was
very
smooth
and
much
to
my
liking
another
quality
brew
from
one
of
the
great
breweries
in
the
world
not
quite
in
the
class
of
the
fullers
porter
but
right
up
there
with
any
of
the
others
pours
a
huge
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lace
smooth
cherry
like
flavor
relatively
thin
body
good
drinkability
very
little
bitterness
excellent
with
food
a
pleasure
to
drink
any
time
ive
had
it
as
is
the
case
with
all
of
samuel
smiths
beers
and
ive
yet
to
be
skunked
this
monster
pours
like
a
stout
chugging
into
the
glass
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
huge
foamy
soapy
combo
for
a
head
lacing
incredible
throughout
burnt
coffee
and
chocolate
on
the
nose
sweet
caramel
and
some
chocolate
notes
up
front
very
rich
and
medium
to
full
bodied
deep
roasted
malts
and
coffee
beans
noted
in
the
body
some
light
acidity
and
bitterness
come
full
circle
flavorful
rich
and
complex
superb
evening
drink
what
a
great
beverage
well
done
by
the
s
s
team
this
is
one
topnotch
porter
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
large
frothy
chocolate
head
that
slowly
receded
to
a
fine
ring
losts
of
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
reminds
me
of
harveys
bristol
cream
sherry
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
again
of
the
sherry
with
some
smokey
hints
very
good
balance
of
flavor
creamy
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
i
had
this
one
other
time
and
didnt
think
much
of
it
but
as
i
have
sampled
other
beers
and
have
taught
my
palate
what
good
beer
is
this
porter
is
one
i
can
really
enjoy
drinkabilitynotes
a
beer
so
superb
that
it
is
difficult
to
justify
with
mere
words
it
is
quite
worthy
of
its
relatively
high
price
surely
one
of
the
finest
porters
and
finest
beers
in
the
world
i
would
note
that
this
beer
is
probably
best
enjoyed
in
cooler
weather
that
normally
found
in
texas
during
the
month
of
june
its
only
spring
now
but
i
long
for
those
cold
northern
winter
nights
so
a
couple
bottles
of
this
can
keep
me
warm
and
satisfied
f
drinkability
pretty
good
for
the
style
due
to
the
somewhat
harsh
bitter
undercurrent
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
it
all
night
however
it
is
a
classic
that
never
fails
to
please
this
was
probably
the
freshest
bottle
ive
ever
had
of
it
a
black
robe
reveals
mahogany
highlights
at
the
base
and
around
the
sides
when
held
to
the
light
its
rocky
tan
head
holds
exceptionally
well
to
start
and
it
maintains
a
thin
creamy
surface
covering
throughout
the
pint
the
nose
displays
caramel
fruit
and
soft
buttery
diacetyl
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
that
leaves
it
lightly
creamy
and
soft
in
the
mouth
and
very
smooth
across
the
palate
the
flavor
reflects
the
nose
with
mildly
sweet
caramel
fruit
thats
a
touch
winey
with
red
grape
raisins
and
berries
milk
chocolate
and
some
rounding
buttery
diacetyl
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
whats
not
to
like
it
finishes
dry
with
a
residual
note
of
fruity
caramel
and
light
butter
very
well
done
with
quite
a
bit
of
finesse
light
but
complex
absolutely
enjoyed
best
at
cellar
temperature
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
that
good
of
a
beer
either
it
is
worth
a
try
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
drinking
regularly
this
is
one
damn
fine
beer
the
best
thing
is
that
its
really
not
that
expensive
3
50
a
bottle
and
the
bottle
is
pretty
good
size
to
it
the
color
was
a
beautiful
dark
color
it
reminded
me
of
the
nights
in
rural
northwest
pa
where
my
nearest
neighbor
was
a
mile
away
there
was
a
bit
of
a
head
to
it
but
it
died
down
to
a
thin
laceing
the
smell
was
that
of
a
roasted
coffee
the
smell
was
somewhat
similar
to
a
coffee
mixede
with
an
alcoholy
taste
mixed
with
a
little
bit
of
a
choclate
taste
i
say
got
for
it
poured
black
with
a
thick
offwhite
foamy
head
a
dark
deep
red
tint
was
apparent
as
i
held
the
glass
to
the
light
the
foam
subsided
after
a
few
minutes
lacing
the
glass
nicely
along
the
way
the
aroma
was
the
distinct
subtle
scent
of
dark
chocolate
with
a
pleasant
hint
of
smoke
the
taste
was
the
same
creamy
smooth
slightly
smoky
with
a
wonderful
mild
hop
finish
the
syrupy
thickness
and
sweet
creamy
mouthfeel
were
a
perfect
combination
for
this
great
beer
truly
a
wonderful
porter
hats
off
to
another
great
product
from
sam
smiths
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
slight
tinge
of
red
along
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
glass
thick
creamy
head
receding
relatively
slowly
leaving
lace
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
almost
like
a
mixture
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
very
inviting
it
buzzes
lightly
on
the
tip
and
sides
of
the
tongue
finishing
dry
i
was
left
salivating
for
another
sip
a
very
light
coffee
taste
is
left
behind
but
overall
very
smooth
doesnt
finish
too
light
or
too
heavy
certainly
a
beer
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
not
to
pound
back
during
the
game
pours
black
with
slight
ruby
highlights
it
forms
a
light
brown
creamy
head
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
milk
chocolatey
roasty
and
coffeelike
it
has
flavors
of
milk
chocolate
with
roasted
malts
and
coffee
notes
it
has
excellent
mouthfeel
it
is
silky
creamy
and
almost
oilybuttery
it
is
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
porters
and
this
one
is
a
very
tasty
one
deserves
a
good
food
match
this
pours
out
with
a
deep
tan
thick
head
that
falls
upon
deep
dark
brownishred
liquid
gently
carbonated
at
that
nose
is
the
typical
sam
smith
aroma
very
low
level
of
diacetyl
mixed
with
their
strain
of
yeast
fruitiness
a
little
toffee
a
little
roasty
maltiness
all
good
taste
is
very
distinctive
a
mix
of
roasted
malt
light
coffee
tones
fruitiness
followed
by
a
justthere
hop
bitterness
finishes
up
dry
and
delicious
long
and
smooth
very
satisfying
one
of
the
most
distinctive
examples
of
the
style
not
a
big
porter
but
one
tasty
ale
great
tasting
porter
i
wish
i
had
a
piece
of
chocolate
cake
to
go
with
it
this
is
an
exceptionally
smooth
and
easy
drinking
porter
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
ruby
hue
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
head
initially
presents
itself
and
then
fades
into
a
nice
lace
aromas
of
malt
and
coffee
are
detected
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
lingering
in
the
background
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
molasses
with
just
the
slightest
touch
of
fruitiness
this
is
a
nice
mediumbodied
creamy
porter
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
think
ive
been
reading
fellow
ba
cokes
reviews
too
much
hes
starting
to
rub
off
on
me
thanks
for
the
inspiration
cokes
overall
this
beer
was
okay
i
dont
think
that
the
flavor
of
this
brew
lived
up
to
the
expectations
caused
by
its
appearance
and
wonderfully
complex
aroma
since
i
love
porters
i
was
excited
to
bring
this
home
and
enjpy
it
with
my
fav
cigar
i
was
dissapointed
i
liked
the
pour
and
the
head
was
very
nice
leaving
some
lace
but
the
taste
left
me
empty
it
had
hardly
a
mouthfeel
to
it
so
i
suppose
im
being
genorous
in
my
rating
hardly
any
of
the
chewiness
im
used
to
in
porters
would
i
drink
again
if
handed
to
me
yes
but
to
buy
it
nope
overall
this
is
a
very
good
porter
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
wishing
to
close
their
eyes
and
drift
away
to
northern
england
altogether
one
of
the
most
drinkable
porters
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
meet
this
was
the
first
porter
ive
tried
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
great
head
that
lasted
through
the
whole
experience
smell
is
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
coffee
comes
back
in
the
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
there
is
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
as
well
mostly
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
was
not
bad
the
brew
was
not
as
filling
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
that
is
a
good
thing
overall
a
solid
brew
a
hard
pour
brings
a
beautiful
delicious

porter

pick

of
every
non

beer
i
ever
drink
a
good
old
school
porter
to
appreciate
whats
available
now
enjoy
what
i
really
got
into
10
years
ago
i
could
drink
this
all
night
except
for
one
thing
i
only
have
had
one
bottle
its
gone
now
and
i
cant
get
this
anywhere

me
ah
well
thanks
for

classic
served
from
a
550ml
bottle
poured
nicely
with
a
rich
head
on
a
almost
black
colored
beer
smell
had
a
hint
of
coffee
which
probably
hurt
my
review
as
a
cannot
stand
coffee
the
taste
was
ok
but
again
hurt
by
the
coffee
taste
for
me
a
good
porter
to
be
enjoyed
every
so
often

taste
is

probably
the
brewing
method
slate
lined

thing
they
do
or
real
hard
water

to

quality
i
find
in
all
sam
smiths
wonderful
beers
it
works
especially
well
with
the
taddy
porter
as
i
felt
this
hardness
of
the
water
balanced
the
roasted
malt
quality
really
well
it
cut
through
it
like
a
knife
and
made
the
porter
very
smooth
and
nicely
drinkable
the
finish
was
rich
and
clean
with
some
dryness
and
earth
great
silky

one
of
the
best
characteristics
of
this

the

is
lighter
than
you
would
expect
from
the
look
but
still
leaves
a
nice
coat
on
the
tongue
a
solid
porter
in
every
way
i
just
wish
they
would
put
it
in
brown
bottles
for
the
usa
export
market
and
casks
for
the

one
this

would
be
fantastic
from
the

oh

velvety
delicate

this

is

much
too
alluring
too
epic
too
sultry
it
lavishes
my
palate
with
serenely
smooth
texture
but
does
not
taste
sweet
it
demonstrates
cocoa
hazelnut
and
cigar
flavors
but
does
not
taste
bitter
though
not
my
personal
favorite
this
porter
definitely
has
its
merits
pouring
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
prominent
creamy
tan
head
this
brew
possesses
the
trademark
samuel
smiths
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
dark
malts
the
smooth
mediumplus
body
supports
a
malty
flavor
with
a
noticeable
smoky
chocolate
overtone
the
grassy
hop
finish
is
a
nice
contrast
to
the
smoky
dark
malts
quite
tasty
excellent
espressobrown
color
with
a
light
browntan
colored
head
that
thinly
veils
the
glass
as
the
beer
goes
along
a
coffee
porter
classic
roasted
flavors
and
coffeechocolate
beginnings
give
it
a
character
that
is
distinctively
samuel
smiths
a
quenching
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
this
one
medium
tan
head
quickly
settles
on
this
beer
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
smell
is
all
about
roasted
malts
its
a
very
complex
nutty
roasted
aroma
medium
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
with
lingering
deep
roasted
bitterness
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
wonderful
porter
its
exactly
what
the
style
brings
to
mind
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
color
yields
some
reddish
tints
when
held
to
the
light
the
lacing
is
impressive
the
nose
is
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
licorice
the
taste
is
more
of
the
roasted
goodness
and
a
bit
of
hazelnut
lurks
beneath
there
are
also
hints
of
dark
chocolate
but
they
are
very
subdued
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
albeit
a
tad
no
pun
intended
bit
thin
for
my
preference
drinkability
is
good
as
this
is
a
pretty
easydrinking
porter
a
choice
offering
from
sammy
smith
my
initial
impression
was
not
favorable
but
this
got
considerably
better
the
warmer
it
got
black
color
and
hearty
flavor
this
is
a
sipping
beer
to
be
sure
carbonation
seemed
to
be
heavy
for
this
style
ill
stick
to
their
oatmeal
and
imperial
stouts
in
the
future
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
eventually
settled
to
a
lace
that
clung
to
the
glass
aroma
and
flavor
of
roast
coffee
and
a
little
bit
of
smoke
very
smooth
low
carbonation
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
good
offering
from
old
brewery
tadcaster
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
fluffy
brown
head
and
nice
lace
coffee
and
chocalote
aromas
with
some
licorice
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
carbonation
tastes
of
coffee
chocolate
toffee
and
a
roasted
flavor
even
smoother
after
warming
a
little
and
not
too
heavy
delicious
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
must
try
a
delicious
big
frothy
head
that
stays
quite
well
very
chocolatey
appearance
coffee
and
chocolate
aromas
in
the
nose
kind
of
a
sweet
smell
very
creamy
mouthfeel
excellent
taste
which
has
a
bit
of
coffee
and
chocolate
very
sweet
a
bit
fruity
only
a
slight
amount
of
bitterness
dark
sweetness
in
the
finish
this
has
an
excellent
taste
and
mouthfeel
excellent
and
well
rounded
porter
that
i
would
find
refreshing
at
any
time
burst
of
expresso
when
popping
the
cap
brownblack
body
with
ruby
highlights
big
fluffy
light

which
settles
down
into
an
inch
then
halk
inch
some

licorice
coffee
chocolate
in

and
taste
less

creamy

with
touch

full

wonderful
porter
good
late
night
beer
another
gem
from
samuel
smith
this
porter
is
too
smooth
for
being
so
dark
very
enjoyable
i
cant
wait
until
i
drink
my
next
taddy
and
i
hope
it
is
tomorrow
this
was
an
excellent
porter
heavy
malt
aroma
with
small
head
very
roasty
flavor
it
is
more
stout
than
other
porters
that
i
like
but
it
is
very
drinkable
dark
creamy
smooth
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
this
beer
was
fantastic
it
was
an
absolute
delite
to
drink
it
doesnt
beat
out
the
oatmeal
stout
but
then
again
that
may
be
impossible
this
one
has
a
nice
dark
color
and
a
good
head
like
most
of
samuel
smiths
the
aroma
is
good
and
the
taste
has
elements
of
chocolate
and
coffee
a
good
beer
but
i
would
agree
with
others
that
you
should
get
the
oatmeal
stout
the
saltiness
in
the
finish
aftertaste
ruins
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
beer
i
may
like
salty
food
with
a
beer
not
salt
in
the
beer
itself
a
very
tasty
porter
very
dark
finishes
dry
and
has
a
slight
taste
of
coffee
please
try
the
oatmeal
stout
though
i
cant
stress
that
enough
this
offering
from
sam
smith
though
is
very
good
and
worth
the
price
one
of
my
favorites
its
a
deep
brownish
black
color
with
a
faint
glimmer
of
red
light
shinning
through
immensely
aromatic
with
layers
of
roast
malt
fruit
licorice
and
minty
herbs
medium
bodied
dry
roasty
and
rich
in
character
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
lingering
malt
dryness
in
the
finish
pours
out
a
deep
cola
color
with
very
little
head
a
butterscotch
and
sweetened
chocolate
nose
barely
perceptible
hop
aroma
taste
is
full
of
chocolate
malts
a
smooth
buttery
mouthfeel
a
slight
bitter
coffeeish
finish
some
hop
bite
on
the
tounge
in
the
very
end
an
absolute
delicious
treat
this
is
my
first
porter
to
ever
drink
if
this
is
a
good
benchmark
i
like
porter
beers
this
beer
has
a
very
dark
color
with
a
very
thin
head
it
is
a
very
smooth
very
drinkable
beer
that
has
a
coffeelike
taste
perfect
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
nice
mouthfeel
i
would
recommend
this
beer
think
ill
have
another
it
ends
with
a
nice
long
finish
like
i
said
though
not
bad
at
all
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
options
open
pours
like
a
champ
pillowy
cottony
1
12

astringency
hops
not
assertive

surprisingly
lighterbodied
at
the
back
of

swallow
is

affirms
my
love
of
porters
quite
a
nice
porter
not
too
thick
buttery
caramel
charactereistics
slightly
roasty
charactereistcs
aswell
good
without
being
exceptional
id
really
like
to
be
able
to
try
this
on
draught
so
i
could
compare
it
with
anchor
porter
as
bottled
beers
go
its
incredible
as
porters
go
its
whats
i
expect
i
love
how
that
yorkshire
yeast
finds
its
way
throught
the
toasted
malt
flavor
very
reminscent
of
a
ringwoodtype
beer
a
slight
acidic
tang
reminds
me
of
a
guinness
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i
wish
they
would
boost
the
abv
a
little
to
catch
up
with
the
rest
of
the
complexties
of
this
brew
and
round
out
the
mouthfeel
but
then
it
would
be
like
too
many
other
porters
out
there
and
not
as
special
very
dark
deep
red
hue
is
perceptible
but
only
when
held
up
to
a
light
thick
persistent
off
white
head
very
mild
roasted
notes
in
the
aroma
with
just
a
hint
a
toffee
and
chocolate
medium
bodied
with
a
very
smooth
and
balanced
chocolate
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
yeasty
fruitiness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
flavorful
and
well
balanced
porter
just
a
notch
below
fullers
london
porter
one
of
my
very
favorites
dark
as
the
ace
of
spades
clean
aroma
warm
coffee
scent
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
but
a
varied
complex
taste
great
interplay
between
hops
and
malts
keeps
the
brew
buttery
and
nourishing
cozy
lingering
burnt
flavor
that
keeps
you
going
back
for
more
sam
smith
brews
never
have
tons
of
character
but
they
are
always
solid
and
delicious
this
one
no
exception
why
the
clear
bottles
though
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
lightly
carbonated
with
a
thin
tan
head
on
the
nose
it
is
sweet
with
plenty
of
malt
and
some
hops
sophisticated
and
balanced
flavor
the
malt
is
firm
on
the
palate
light
caramel
notes
thick
roasted
malt
flavor
followed
by
a
rich
coffee
bitterness
i
detected
a
faint
taste
of
grapes
and
plums
finish
is
slightly
chocolately
leading
to
a
long
bitter
malty
coffee
aftertaste
i
found
this
beer
to
be
slightly
flat
and
dangerously
close
to
being
thin
it
may
have
been
the
batch
i
purchased
time
will
tell
an
excellent
choice
with
seafood
a
must
try
enjoy
cheers
what
a
great
porter
smooth
and
velvety
chocolaty
tasting
this
beer
is
definitely
an
experience
to
savor
perhaps
a
tiny
bit
too
sweet
definitely
one
to
drink
sparingly
but
do
be
sure
to
have
one
notes
textured
and
well
structured
a
top
shelf
porter
and
worth
the
a
classic
porter
worldwide
one
of
best
in
the
sam
smith
brand
i
know
this
is
considered
one
of
the
touchstones
against
which
other
porters
are
judged
and
maybe
that
is
why
it
seems
to
fall
short
of
my
expectations
very
nice
but
not
outstanding
decent
porter
but
nothing
special
not
much
here
certainly
not
offensive
but
just
not
much
personality
to
distinguish
it
from
others
not
the
best
porter
i
have
had
tastes
like
a
dark
budweiser
i
hope
that
i
got
a
bad
glass
or
the
wrong
beer
but
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
overtones
i
read
about
in
the
reviews
the
green
man
porter
is
one
of
my
favorite
porters
very
smooth
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
slight
smoky
finish
but
that
is
what
i
expect
in
a
porter
my
only
criticism
is
the
head
it
has
none
and
almost
seems
flat
still
a
good
beer
if
you
like
porters
definitely
try
this
one
smokey
roasty
slightly
sweet
a
bit
of
chocolate
this
is
a
delicious
porter
o
very
high
drinkability
enjoyable
definitely
a
goto
porter
if
available
overall
i
am
so
happy
this
is
being
distributed
more
widely
and
in
bottles
my
one
problem
which
really
is
not
a
problem
is
they
should
offer
this
in
cans
i
hope
they
do
a
lot
of
asheville
breweries
are
beginning
to
go
that
direction

green

porter
is

easy
to

it

this
traditionally

britishstyle

like

knew
nothing
about
this
beer

brewery
when
i
picked
it
up
a
good
one
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
their
offerings
when
back
down

o
this
is
a

i
would
drink
this

i
can
think
of
a

of
better
porters
poured
from
a

into
a

the
beer
is

are

very
tasty
and
once
again
very
well
balanced

with
a
dryness
to
it
that
keeps
the
sweet
flavors
in
check
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
bitter
coffee
and
cocoa
notes
but
the
creamy
sweet
character
does
peek
its
head
out
here
and
there
at
the
end
of
each
drink
the
finish
is
slick
crisp
and
slightly
dry
very

brew
o
this
is
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
porter
and
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
green
man
it
has
been
a
solid
brew
for
quite
a
while
and
one
which
is
definitely
sessionable
easy
to
drink
with

lacing
per
se
as
a
razor
residue
after
you
tilt
the
glass
the
liquid
is
an
impenetrable
black
with
a
yellow
aura
around
it
upon
very
close
inspection
theres
a
few
bubble
beads
visible
the
nose
is
filled
with
brazil
nuts
cashews
vanilla
caramel
and
brown
sugar
cherry
and
red
berry
fruit
while
sweet
and
roasty
also
has
that
telltale
organic
metallic
mineral
water
touch
to
it
no
overt
signs
of
hops
however
the
overall
feel
has
a
refreshing
stiffness
to
it
not
soft
and
flabby
light
to
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
has
decent
activity
and
that
mineral
water
aspect
gives
it
cleanliness
the
cocoa
chocolate
vanilla
cola
coffee
bean
nut
flavors
have
cut
not
overly
roasted
nor
burnt
the
black
fruits
more
muted
here
particularly
as
it
becomes
successively
drier
from
midpalate
through
the
finish
here
you
do
get
a
grassy
twinge
at
the
end
too
seems
calculated
to
appeal
to
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
while
also
remaining
food
friendly
and
trim
light
of
step
a
good
summertime
option
for
those
who
like
porters
o
this
porter
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
good
amount
of
flavors
had
this
one
at
the
source
on
a
past
ticking
trip
to
asheville
served
from
tap
into
a
green
man
sampler
shaker
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
very
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
earth
hop
dark
chocolate
and
nutty
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
dark
chocolate
nutty
and
peanuts
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
my
one
question
on
this
one
is
where
did
all
of
this
nuttiness
come
from
holy
moly
it
would
have
been
nice
if
it
were
only
an
undertone
but
that
amount
was
just
a
little
bit
too
much
to
put
this
one
in
a
good
category
it
however
did
not
totally
ruin
the
brew
but
it
definitely
would
have
ranked
higher
if
the
nuttiness
were
toned
back
slightly
decent
porter
from
beer
city
usa
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
though
it
poured
an
inky
black
with
a
dirty
brown
head
the
look
was
nice
but
everything
else
was
just
about
average
the
flavors
were
all
indicative
of
a
porter
the
problem
was
the
the
flavors
simply
were
not
there
in
abundance
the
finish
was
watery
with
very
subtle
smoke
and
given
the
style
of
beer
i
really
would
have
appreciated
something
my
palate
could
marinate
on
for
an
extended
period
of
time
overall
this
a
solid
porter
and
i
would
love
to
have
it
on
tap
sometime
i
love
green
man
brewery
in
general
and
have
yet
to
drink
one
of
their
beers
that
i
didnt
enjoy
this
is
a
nice
traditional
porter
it
has
solid
flavor
and
good
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
this
one
is
a
winner
the
cask
certainly
added
to
the
experience
d
really
easy
to
drink
pretty
good
balance
typical
characteristics
and
a
bit
thin
but
enjoyable
on
tap
pours
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
long
lasting
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
cacao
brown
sugar
toast
nutts
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
medium
smooth
body
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
finish
is
semisweet
long
lasting
light
easy
drinking
porter
went
out
for
a
pint
with
my
wife
the
other
night
and
grabbed
one
of
these
to
start
it
off
came
out
a
thick
dark
black
with
a
thin
tawny
head
on
top
rich
nose
with
big
hits
of
coffee
and
chocolate
lots
of
roasted
goodness
the
mouth
is
weighted
perfectly
as
there
is
a
nice
chew
to
this
one
this
beer
is
teeming
with
a
bounty
of
roasted
coffee
there
is
a
green
element
to
this
beer
though
leafy
greens
noticed
in
the
flavor
with
a
fresh
hop
presence
nice
bitter
snap
at
the
end
this
was
a
great
beer
and
one
i
would
gladly
have
again
appearance
similar
to
most
porters
nice
meddark
brown
head
with
good
retention
nose
nothing
to
write
home
about
once
you
take
a
sip
thats
where
you
notice
how
great
of
a
porter
this
is
one
of
the
most
if
not
the
most
enjoyable
porters
to
drink
ive
had
nice
balance
of
maltiness
with
some
hints
of
roastiness
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
smooth
in
all
aspects
great
on
a
crisp
autumn
day
sitting
outside
thick
dark
brown
with
a
large
creamy
tan
colored
head
on
the
top
great
retention
let
it
hang
around
for
what
seemed
like
forever
before
finally
being
nestled
down
into
just
a
thin
layer
across
the
top
the
aroma
was
very
full
and
sweet
lots
of
chocolate
roaming
through
it
along
with
a
touch
of
coffee
and
lots
of
sugar
a
slight
smoked
presentation
as
well
the
flavor
was
also
very
full
for
a
porter
this
almost
had
a
stout
like
feel
to
it
as
it
was
very
thick
and
full
with
a
great
robust
profile
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
dominated
it
overall
probably
average
for
the
style
i
think
english
porters
just
are
not
all
that
enjoyable
for
me
its
the
odd
sour
thin
characteristics
i
dislike
every
time
i
have
the
style
ontap
at
jack
of
the
wood
in
a
shaker
pint
dark
brown
with
thin
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
big
splotches
of
lace
smell
fruity
caramel
nutty
with
a
little
bittersweet
chocolate
taste
toasted
nuts
caramelized
sugars
fruity
clean
finish
decent
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
porter
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
on
my
way
out
of
asheville
this
month
i
stopped
at
the
airport
bar
i
sampled
a
few
beers
including
the
green
man
porter
the
color
was
light
for
a
porter
bordering
on
a
dark
oak
when
poured
its
head
was
tan
and
thin
nose
smelled
of
cocoa
and
carmel
it
is
certainly
malty
what
else
would
you
expect
from
a
porter
a
majority
of
the
taste
is
oatmeal
with
brown
sugar
with
a
very
low
ibu
a
good
beer
but
not
exceptional
i
personally
think
it
is
better
than
highlands
oatmeal
porter
due
to
a
difference
in
hop
content
or
type
of
hops
mouthfeel
could
be
preceived
as
a
bit
thin
but
it
does
border
on
creamy
still
alcohol
nonexistent
and
really
drinkable
in
all
seasons
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
poured
a
near
jet
black
except
for
a
tinge
of
rubya
thin
off
white
head
atop
picked
up
roast
and
bitter
chocolate
mainly
in
the
nosethere
was
a
light
fruitiness
underlying
as
well
pretty
well
rounded
flavors
going
onsomewhat
roasty
and
earthy
from
the
onseta
juicy
fruitiness
seems
to
come
in
late
and
makes
it
pretty
balanced
a
little
thin
but
its
a
sociable
porternot
half
badi
would
liked
to
try
on
cask
d
solid
overall
although
i
found
this
porter
to
be
pretty
runofthemill
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
i
love
cask
ales
i
wish
they
were
more
common
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
pour
was
somewhat
flat
with
a
thin
cocoa
head
that
was
gone
before
my
eyes
lighter
colored
than
what
im
used
to
and
almost
crystal
clear
when
held
to
light
with
a
rubymahogany
color
smell
was
very
nice
with
the
malts
being
more
sweet
with
less
roasted
character
than
many
american
porters
i
have
sweet
chocolate
with
hints
of
caramel
coffee
and
a
small
earthygrassy
hop
bite
mouthfeel
was
a
fairly
light
and
thin
not
necessarily
too
watery
but
the
body
wasnt
big
enough
carbonation
being
extremely
low
might
have
played
a
factor
still
i
find
this
very
drinkable
the
stuff
went
down
about
as
quick
as
it
was
poured
after
i
got
the
point
of
what
i
was
dealing
with
split
this
on
thanksgiving
with
my
sister
who
happened
to
purchase
it
from
green
man
in
asheville
nice
drinkability
pretty
solid
presents
a
bit
more
character
than
our
last
encounter
found
the
beer
at
jack
of
the
wood
in
asheville
nc
the
taproom
at
the
brewery
was
closing
who
closes
at
1100
on
saturday
night
so
this
was
the
closest
place
to
find
the
beers
the
porter
turns
out
to
be
quite
nice
a
flavorful
barley
aroma
and
taste
give
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
coffee
and
nuttiness
lots
of
sweetness
approach
caramel
levels
but
level
off
just
before
the
lowlying
hop
presence
lets
the
beer
seem
sweeter
and
maltier
than
it
acually
is
no
real
hop
aroma
little
flavor
and
a
balanced
bittering
body
is
a
bit
light
but
fair
for
an
english
porter
finishes
on
a
clean
fermented
cocoa
note
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
certainly
quenched
my
thirst
on
this
summer
night
the
taste
has
the
porter
qualities
i
tend
to
look
for
minus
the
smoke
it
features
the
more
traditional
chocolate
and
barley
malt
flavors
a
decent
sweetness
and
a
dry
finish
that
lingers
briefly
at
the
end
serving
type
bottle
overall
good
porter
probably
fits
certain
tastes
better
than
others
closer
to
the
brown
ale
end
of
the
spectrum
than
the
stout
end
the
taste
is
pretty
great
dark
malt
with
a
variety
of
roasted
and
semisweet
chocolate
with
some
mild
raisinlike
yeast
flavor
combined
with
a
slight
spicy
hop
in
the
background
which
adds
to
the
complexity
with
a
toffee
like
dark
sugar
and
mild
figlike
flavor
the
taste
has
a
chocolate
covered
raisin
effect
with
mild
spice
to
keep
things
interesting
a
mild
dry
finish
and
light
alcohol
makes
it
very
drinkable
overall
i
was
really
impressed
i
have
kind
of
found
this
style
to
be
less
impressive
lately
but
this
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
as
it
was
satisfying
and
drinkable
with
pretty
decent
value
as
a
bonus
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
this
style
this
beer
is
an
utterly
black
ale
it
has
a
lastin
brownish
head
and
a
multifaceted
roasty
malty
earthy
aroma
there
is
a
little
fruit
some
plum
and
berry
the
taste
is
semi
dry
with
a
lot
of
dark
malt
and
roasted
grain
chocolate
milk
and
mild
bitterness
malt
it
is
a
mildly
heavy
scottish
ale
dark
and
luxurious
the
beer
pours
dark
black
in
color
like
a
good
black
coffee
the
beer
pours
with
a
half
a
fingers
width
of
small
bubbles
the
color
of
sand
dunes
which
leaves
a
lacing
of
medium
bubbles
that
leave
a
sticky
thin
webbing
on
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
too
dark
to
look
through
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
light
and
bakers
chocolate
with
nice
toffee
notes
and
hints
of
coffee
with
cream
and
sugar
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
with
a
good
drying
bitter
from
the
light
roast
and
a
soft
touch
of
fruity
acidity
in
the
finish
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
light
dark
fruit
notes
dancing
somewhere
between
plum
and
raisin
though
never
touching
upon
the
richer
raisin
notes
this
light
fruitiness
slowly
blended
with
smooth
roasted
malts
smooth
and
a
touch
of
metallic
flavor
the
finish
rings
with
light
roast
and
a
touch
of
lactic
sugar
while
the
aftertaste
gives
light
hints
to
the
ginger
in
the
middle
of
the
throat
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
in
body
with
a
soft
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
with
a
light
scrub
the
beer
feels
slick
and
leaves
a
little
coating
of
saliva
as
it
exits
the
tongue
leaving
the
mouth
wet
yet
roasty
dry
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
english
scottish
porter
with
some
nice
unique
notes
from
the
ginger
that
help
to
give
fruitiness
to
the
beer
try
this
beer
final
thoughts
this
is
a
very
well
done
porter
and
walks
that
line
of
being
easy
and
interesting
very
well
with
this
williams
bros
has
earned
its
place
as
one
of
my
favourite
scottish
breweries
i
suddenly
want
to
hunt
down
a
bottle
of
one
of
their
scottish
ales
this
is
a
nice
and
robust
porter
in
a
slightly
more
english
tone
than
american
mild
smoked
and
peaty
thing
going
on
this
strikes
me
as
what
an
english
porter
should
be
smooth
feel
very
easy
to
drink
glad
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
out
and
again
glad
to
see
something
different
from
this
brewery
than
their
lineup
of
gruit
style
ales
really
tasty
and
flavourful
porter
a
really
solid
example
of
the
style
with
lots
of
nice
rounded
flavour
and
easy
to
drink
not
too
imposing
or
bitter
and
it
actually
has
a
pretty
respectable
complexity
for
being
quite
light
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
cask
very
nice
an
easy
drinker
i
could
have
whizzed
through
a
few
more
of
these
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
a
welcome
twist
and
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
porters
this
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
light
brown
head
the
scent
is
rich
and
robust
with
roasted
malts
caramel
malts
and
coffee
tones
the
taste
is
bold
but
not
quite
as
bold
as
what
you
get
with
stouts
the
texture
is
smooth
and
reasonably
light
there
is
a
sweetness
and
cocoa
flavor
that
is
very
prominent
it
finishes
with
a
slightly
chalky
after
taste
overall
a
pretty
decent
porter
overall
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
like
this
is
still
a
nice
porter
that
adds
some
winter
warmer
elements
as
another
ba
noted
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
porter
b
84
overall
it
was
actually
ordered
wrong
ordered
other
beers
so
i
wasnt
planning
on
drinking
this
nor
did
i
know
about
the
existence
but
as
it
turns
out
this
is
a
very
lovely
porter
i
like
the
way
it
integrates
the
dark
fruit
flavor
without
dominating
giving
it
just
that
little
more
freshness
and
originality
to
it
well
done
o
very
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
quite
a
lovely
porter
pours
quickly
and
easily
creating
small
head
which
doesnt
dissipate
completely
throughout
the
drink
quite
a
spicy
dark
and
thick
beer
with
a
bitter
quality
throughout
the
taste
another
fine
product
from
the
brilliant
william
brothers
brewery
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
beers
and
a
frequent
buy
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
scottish
ale
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
it
give
it
a
pop
its
a
good
porter
but
its
not
what
i
hoped
for
this
a
well
made
decent
tasting
but
largely
unremarkable
beer
with
little
depth
or
complexity
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
nice
side
effect
of
the
thinner
body
is
that
it
goes
down
so
easily
one
question
i
am
left
with
is
would
this
be
as
good
a
beer
without
the
spice
of
course
i
dont
know
but
as
it
is
its
pretty
damn
nice
overall
not
what
i
expected
sort
of
like
a
winter
warmer
meets
porter
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
poured
a
quarter
inch
mocha
head
with
average
fade
the
body
is
a
dark
burnt
umber
brown
color
almost
coffee
the
smell
is
very
mild
for
a
porter
even
warm
but
theres
some
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
the
taste
mirrors
and
exceeds
the
smell
it
has
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
texture
smooth
creamy
almost
milky
a
good
porter
enjoyed
at
rattle
and
hum
in
nyc
served
at
room
temp
pours
a
deep
brown
not
quite
opaque
cask
pour
had
no
head
to
speak
of
had
a
slight
smoky
scent
peat
maybe
not
overpowering
in
any
way
taste
was
remarkable
slightly
sweetened
plums
or
other
dark
fruits
smoky
peat
whiskey
attributes
smooth
easy
to
drink
had
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
a
really
nice
offering
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
a
tasty
solid
porter
which
is
more
interesting
than
many
other
uk
porters
its
good
but
not
great
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com1001beers
very
nice
porter
that
is
great
for
eating
some
psuedoenglish
pub
fare
i
had
more
than
one
then
i
read
the
label
ginger
thats
it
ginger
not
liquorice
a
sort
of
christmas
ale
version
of
a
porter
this
is
a
very
nonagressive
beer
that
offers
a
fine
balance
along
with
some
crispness
all
in
all
a
fne
quaff
from
a
small
scottish
brewer
check
it
out
if
you
come
across
it
because
if
its
not
scottish
its
crap
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
english
porter
glad
i
tried
this
at
44
stone
public
house
d
solid
porter
with
a
nice
twist
of
ginger
overall
not
bad
very
creamy
and
lactose
nice
malt
flavors
not
too
bitter
nice
chocolate
and
vanilla
flavors
but
could
have
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
bigger
body
and
maybe
a
hint
more
hops
the
brew
pours
a
dark
cola
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
fast
vanishing
two
finger
head
and
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
nice
and
roasty
with
hints
of
chocolatetobaccocoffeeliquorice
and
spicy
hopsthe
taste
is
very
similar
with
hints
of
chocolatecoffeeroasted
toasted
oatsliquorice
and
finishes
with
a
spicy
hop
bitterness
and
overall
a
very
pleasant
porter
and
very
drinkable
cheers
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
overall
this
is
a
fairly
modest
and
unassuming
beer
but
it
has
just
enough
richness
in
the
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
at
5
6
and
a
bit
on
the
darkroasty
side
its
surprisingly
refreshing
as
well
poured
into
an
imperial
nonic
a
near
jet
black
except
for
a
few
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
lighta
12
finger
beige
colored
head
that
held
well
carred
aromas
with
some
black
licorice
really
standing
out
as
wella
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
bitter
chocolate
as
well
heavy
roast
and
charred
dark
fruit
flavorsi
was
surprised
at
the
dryness
and
the
roast
it
was
alot
like
an
american
style
porter
in
my
mind
a
little
sharp
and
thin
in
the
feel
but
its
a
nice
roasty
porterone
i
would
buy
again
overall
a
decent
beer
for
sure
but
i
would
choose
fullers
or
even
st
peters
before
this
one
glad
i
was
able
to
give
this
one
a
go
but
i
dont
think
ill
go
back
d
tasty
goes
down
easily

poured
this

into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
very
dark
for
sure
black
more
like
it
with
a
chocolate
colored
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
very
chocolate
also
and
i
had
high
hopes
for
the
beer
however
the
beer
tasted
like
a
flat
coke
or
pepsi
i
dont
mean
just
flat
i
mean
it
tasted
like
coke
a

i
will
not

drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
easy
to
drink
porter
though
it
is
not
a
beer
of
which
i
would
necessarily
choose
to
have
2
in
a
row
i
would
be
happy
to
have
another
in
a
few
days
or
a
week
though
maybe
its
the
burnt
flavor
that
makes
me
feel
that
way
but
this
is
a
bit
different
yet
very
good
porter

a
good

you
have
to
exercise
those

to

it
down
the
indian
cuisine
like
spices
of
ginger
cumin

and
curry
clear
enough
that
they
push
most
else
to
the
side
this
also
hardens
the
contours
of
the

the

moderate
at
best
but
does
fit
the
general
tone
nicely
odd
that
again
virtually
no
fruit

this
is
a
very

used
in
select
circumstances
preferably
with

enjoyed

would
drink
my
other
one
if
it
was
not
already
part

a
trade
deal
a

thin

not
watery
carbonation
causes
a
not
quite
creamy
body

pleasant
very
drinkable
not
a
whole
lot
to
it
but
a
good
drinkable
enlgish
porter
d
drinks
quite
well
i
would
have
had
multiple
glasses
of
this
if
there
werent
so
many
other
beers
to
try
tonight
smooth
rich
and
very
moreish
i
liked
this
a
great
deal
big
porter
that
almost
drinks
baltic
would
go
again
notes
worth
the
cask
try
but
nothing
particularly
memorable
good
brew
in
any
case
i
wonder
if
part
of
the
subdued
taste
is
in
part
due
to
being
an
imported
cask
being
on
its
last
legs
typically
3
weeks
to
cross
the
atlantic
and
get
through
customs
for
something
like
this
right
interesting
memorable
unique
the
mouthfeel
for
me
was
much
too
carbonated
very
sharp
and
hard
carbonation
with
a
medium
to
thin
body
cherry
black
with
a
head
that
might
make
other
porters
jealous
tall
smooth
camelcolored
firm
and
resilient
wonderfully
upfront
with
aromas
of
chocolate
coffee
malted
milk
and
a
mellow
ginger
vibe
plus
a
nice
mangopeach
fruitiness
a
wink
of
vanilla
and
just
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
tastes
very
reminiscent
of
root
beer
no
doubt
from
the
combination
of
caramelized
dark
sugars
vanilla
herbal
hops
and
the
light
spice
of
ginger
the
flavor
segues
from
cherry
cola
into
coffee
closing
with
a
bitter
finish
of
mocha
and
citric
hops
quite
dry
although
i
fear
the
dryness
comes
at
the
expense
of
a
fuller
mouthfeel
and
richer
malt
character
but
of
course
this
is
a
porter
not
a
stout
so
the
lighter
body
is
not
really
inappropriate
overall
this
is
delicious
and
interesting
the
ginger
is
a
welcome
innovation
subtle
yet
noticeable
enough
to
make
this
stand
out
among
standard
porters
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
after
a
couple
in
a
row
i
would
move
on
to
something
else
notes
500
ml
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
best
before
date
on
bottle
was
may
2010
d
pretty
good
in
spite
of
the
intense
bizarre
herbal
flavors
it
is
still
pretty
good
very
nice
beer
but
dont
buy
a
case
try
as
part
of
a
mix
or
simply
pick
up
a
couple
off
the
shelf
if
you
can
find
it
overall
it
is
a
great
example
of
style
i
love
and
feel
that
i
do
not
see
enough
of
in
the
us
or
uk
goes
great
with
food
especially
curry
and
spicy
stir

it
is

delicious
and
very
well
crafted

comments
this
is
an
astounding
porter
even
though
it
was
a
bit
too
cold
when
i
sampled
it
the
complexity
was
fantastic
really
well
balanced
and
scrumptious
as
hell
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
on
the
whole
a
really
nice
beer
and
a
success
for
this
scottish
microbrewery

the
texture
is
very
soft

this
quaffable
porter
certainly
doesnt
taste
as
such
if
you
dont
know
what
an
english
style
porter
is
i
encourage
you
to
read
up
before
trying
not
everyone
likes
a
lighter
bodied
porter
but
if
youre
familiar
with
the
style
youre
going
to
like
this
beer
this
is
a
very
well
executed
english
porter
with
some
tastefully
subtle
pumpkin
spicing
in
the
background
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
porter
i
like
the
roasted
pumpkin
flavor
id
certainly
get
it
again
next
year
o
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
this
one
wasnt
horrible
and
i
wouldnt
deliberately
avoid
it
like
i
would
most
pumpkins
but
overall
its
still
just
an
average
beer
no
real
aroma
or
taste
that
stands
out
no
bad
tastes
just
pretty
generic

near
full

you
guys
that
keep
saying
its
watered
down
need
to
check
your
buds
the
best
beers
arnt
the
ones
that
have
the
most
intense
flavor
they
are
the
ones
that
mix
flavors
in
artisan
way
best
pumpkin
ive
had
this
year
bottle
pour
nice
nose
has
some
pumpkin
spice
going
on
i
was
intrigued
until
i
tasted
it
theres
not
enough
body
here
for
a
porter
and
i
wasnt
convinced
the
flavor
was
pumpkin
and
not
just
some
random
gourd
the
finish
is
just
meh
not
terrible
but
not
going
to
make
anyones
list
of
top
pumpkin
beers
overall
disappointing
falls
short
at
being
a
porter
and
at
being
a
pumpkinanything
leaving
you
with
an
essentially
characterless
beer
that
leaves
you
scratching
your
head
wondering
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
the
intended
final
beer
this
beer
has
been
getting
shitty
ratings
i
was
hesitant
to
even
try
a
pumpkin
porter
but
you
know
i
really
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
its
really
not
a
pumpkin
beer
and
its
really
not
a
porter
in
the
traditional
respect
and
if
you
are
looking
to
rate
it
on
those
parameters
then
you
would
feel
disappointed
i
however
thought
it
was
a
good
hybrid
style
you
get
those
porter
notes
in
there
but
you
also
get
the
pumpkin
spices
i
did
not
detect
pumpkin
itself
if
there
is
really
any
in
there
to
begin
with
you
do
get
the
spices
which
i
enjoy
on
a
limited
basis
and
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
one
or
to
finish
off
a
night
of
fall
beer
drinking
is
it
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
no
but
it
is
interesting
and
was
better
than
it
has
been
represented
here
for
the
most
part
the
mouthfeel
is
too
watery
to
be
a
porter
in
my
opinion
you
taste
a
hit
a
pumpkin
but
the
spices
definitely
overwhelm
the
rest
in
a
not
so
great
way
it
leaves
an
unpleasant
bitterness
on
the
palate
not
my
cup
of
tea
overall
it
has
a
good
look
and
some
good
flavor
but
to
light
and
watery
and
not
nearly
enough
malts
to
give
it
the
complexity
it
needs
this
pumpkin
porter
is
almost
too
light
to
be
a
porter
dont
get
me
wrong
the
flavor
is
very
nice
but
a
little
on
the
light
side
plenty
of
pumpkin
spices
almost
too
much
and
it
overtakes
the
pumpkin
flavor
a
tad
too
much
overall
very
drinkable
but
seems
to
lack
a
touch
more
robust
and
pumpkin
tastes
this
beer
lacks
the
darkness
of
a
porter
i
dont
taste
the
porter
i
taste
the
pumpkin
yeah
so
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
a
crowd
vits
doesnt
out
by
it
self
its
lacks
a
want
vto
come
bvack
to
it
its
a
shame
it
could
have
been
wonderful
but
the
word
you
look
for
is
lacking
this
beer
is
lacking
the
great
pumpkin
taste
that
even
linus
wont
wait
up
for
o
an
average
fall
beer
from
starr
hill
i
liked
their
the
love
beer
a
lot
better
lighter
bodied
than
expected
with
an
overwhelming
autumnal
spice
presence
and
acrid
burnt
malt
flavors
im
not
picking
up
any
pumpkin
at
all
just
burnt
malt
and
dry
spice
lots
of
pepper
clove
and
ginger
without
much
else
on
the
spice
front
to
balance
things
out
also
the
malt
character
is
lacking
sweetness
with
overly
dry
charcoal
flavor
hints
of
ashtray
burnt
wood
and
charred
toast
making
this
beer
intensely
dry
and
unpleasant
even
a
little
bit
of
pumpkin
or
sweeter
malt
flavor
would
help
this
beer
but
as
is
its
a
mess
of
a
beer
that
i
dumped
down
the
drain
overall
this
is
another
variation
on
the
pumpkin
ale
style
which
sadly
does
not
have
much
pumpkin
in
it
if
only
the
taste
followed
the
nose
this
would
have
been
an
excellent
brew
since
the
taste
falls
short
i
am
forced
to
rate
this
as
only
okay
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
ruby
edges
and
a
finger
of
beige
head
the
nose
has
definite
pumpkin
notes
the
flavor
profile
delivers
on
pumpkin
but
not
as
much
as
the
nose
might
indicate
the
roast
profile
is
quite
mild
increasing
slightly
on
the
finish
this
is
tasty
but
not
terribly
special
o
overall
a
decent
try
the
pumpkin
quality
itself
is
more
evident
on
the
nose
but
takes
a
back
seat
flavor
wise
decent
rich
porter
bordering
on
stout
quality
with
a
good
roasty
coffee
accent
things
started
off
great
with
a
blackish
body
and
one
finger
head
that
slowly
died
with
lace
patches
smell
is
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
possible
nutmeg
should
really
be
combined
with
bready
roasted
malts
as
it
seems
to
clash
the
beer
is
even
worse
when
it
comes
to
tastemouthfeel
in
terms
of
clash
bc
the
sweetness
one
expects
from
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
not
to
mention
slight
spice
seem
to
gets
bulldozed
over
by
a
slightly
boozy
roasted
and
breadlike
malt
base
finishes
a
little
haggard
and
not
something
ill
bother
trying
again
although
decent
idea
o
overall
i
wanted
more
a
soso
porter
with
a
little
pumpkin
i
wanted
a
bit
more
richness
perhaps
a
luxuriousness
to
it
but
it
falls
short
on
the
base
style
as
well
as
the
pumpkin
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
however
ogreat
beer
for
a
cooler
than
normal
over
cast
day
in
fall
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
though
i
could
have
used
more
pumpkin
and
spice
still
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
if
care
us
taken
for
the
amazing
drinkability
i
could
down
too
many
of
these
in
a
hurry
i
have
not
had
enough
starr
hill
beers
to
go
in
with
a
closed
mind
so
i
was
ready
to
see
if
there
was
a
good
alternative
to
the
regular
pumpkin
ales
the
pour
displayed
a
thin
murkycolored
porter
that
didnt
seem
that
it
would
be
exciting
and
my
nose
revealed
that
to
be
correct
very
muted
with
some
roasted
pumpkin
and
maybe
touch
of
spice
and
cocoa
not
much
different
on
the
palate
very
thin
with
little
to
no
finish
disappointing
to
say
the
least
verdict
i
think
it
was
not
bad
my
first
pumpkin
porter
to
be
exact
i
like
how
the
pumpkin
doesnt
crash
your
taste
buds
unlike
southern
tiers
pumking
not
the
best
porter
but
definitely
would
have
again
this
pumpkin
beer
is
a
dark
brow
almost
black
the
head
is
small
but
a
nice
brownish
tan
the
smell
is
a
medium
intensify
mix
of
spice
and
roasted
malt
the
combination
is
not
usual
and
the
scents
compete
for
attention
the
result
is
good
but
not
great
the
taste
is
heavily
spice
centered
it
is
a
lighter
beer
in
body
than
i
would
have
wanted
its
not
the
kind
of
brew
that
id
want
many
of
o
this
one
just
bores
me
while
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
theres
nothing
that
pops
out
as
being
impressive
either
basically
its
a
middle
of
the
road
please
the
masses
kind
of
beer
that
simply
isnt
for
me
o
this
beer
is
interesting
a
little
more
porter
than
pumpkin
but
that
is
ok
with
me
it
seems
like
this
beer
needs
to
be
refined
a
little
bit
to
make
it
a
touch
easier
to
drink
the
spice
flavorsmouthfeel
make
this
one
that
you
dont
want
to
have
multiple
in
a
session
not
a
pumpkin
brew
a
porter
that
claims
to
be
a
pumpkin
brew
but
all
i
really
got
was
a
hint
of
spice
when
i
cracked
the
bottle
pours
dark
and
is
a
tasty
porter
but
again
not
a
pumpkin
beer
mostly
a
chocolately
taste
with
a
thin
head
and
full
rich
body
pumpkin
beer
in
midaugust
dont
mind
if
i
do
is
what
i
said
to
myself
when
picking
up
a
sixpack
of
boxcar
for
about
8
49
here
in
va
the
other
day
the
brew
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
12
inch
foamy
brown
head
that
remains
almost
till
the
end
smell
is
of
pumpkin
malt
a
little
bit
of
spice
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
really
nice
combination
the
taste
is
excellent
robust
really
just
a
hint
of
pumpkin
in
this
which
makes
it
a
nice
choice
for
a
fall
porter
could
drink
a
good
amount
of
these
in
one
sitting
always
a
positive
i
think
an
okay
rating
from
beer
advocate
is
ridiculous
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
the
fact
that
someone
attempted
a
pumpkin
porter
which
you
dont
see
much
and
did
it
without
over
spicing
it
and
giving
it
an
equal
pumpkin
and
porter
taste
from
start
to
finish
deserves
a
medalthis
is
a
beautiful
fall
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewery
oh
and
beer
advocate
starr
hill
now
spells
boxcarr
with
two
rs
m
medium
bodied
o
a
little
sloppy
andor
gratuitous
use
of
spice
imo
not
the
best
style
application
but
a
drinkable
effort
overall
doesnt
really
combine
to
make
it
worthwhile
o
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
in
this
one
porters
and
pumpkin
ales
are
two
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
beer
didnt
mesh
them
very
well
ive
had
homebrew
pumpkin
porters
that
blow
this
one
out
of
the
water
overall
i
can
confirm
this
is
an
average
porter
with
mild
if
any
spice
pass
on
it
if
you
can
o
a
really
nice
combination
here
id
say
this
tolerable
amount
of
fall
spices
in
this
roasts
brew
is
perfect
alone
or
with
a
nice
meal
on
a
cold
day
ive
eyed
this
several
times
before
but
always
ended
up
buying
something
else
my
mom
and
her
beau
were
in
town
for
the
weekend
and
he
loves
a
good
porter
we
thought
wed
give
this
a
spin
we
bought
a
six
pack
and
i
think
i
can
help
finish
it
but
i
dont
think
i
will
repurchase
it
in
the
future
this
was
just
average
while
initially
feeling
balanced
this
got
a
bit
too
aggressive
feeling
the
more
this
warmed
up
and
in
the
end
i
just
wasnt
nearly
as
impressed
with
this
as
i
was
hoping
there
are
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
on
the
market
right
now
overall
this
is
an
odd
beer
not
what
i
expected
based
on
the
description
of
a
pumpkin
porter
i
got
some
porter
qualities
but
no
pumpkin
and
then
there
was
the
unexpected
sourness
the
sour
quality
wasnt
bad
but
i
dont
think
it
was
supposed
to
be
there
my
guess
is
that
this
batchbottle
got
infected
by
a
bug
overall
a
nice
addition
to
the
pumpkin
beer
lineup
and
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
the
style
overall
too
smokey
for
my
taste
buds
the
smell
was
the
highlight
of
this
brew
there
are
other
pumpkinfall
seasonals
that
i
prefer
abd
i
probably
wont
try
this
one
again
cheers
boxcar
doesnt
work
for
me
and
the
recipe
should
be
tweaked
in
my
opinion
o
every
year
i
think
i
have
had
every
pumpkin
beer
and
every
year
i
find
six
more
to
buy
i
know
that
most
will
be
okay
though
not
great
a
pumpkin
porter
appealed
to
me
beyond
the
alliteration
involved
a
porter
with
a
touch
of
earthy
or
sweet
pumpkin
seemed
like
a
good
idea
and
it
is
well
at
least
the
idea
is
not
bad
the
pumpkin
is
present
slightly
in
the
finish
otherwise
the
smoke
of
the
porter
takes
over
most
of
the
flavors
o
this
was
a
decent
pumpkin
porter
i
like
the
smoothness
and
flavors
overall
just
not
pleasant
i
might
buy
if
im
hard
up
for
a
pumpkin
beer
this
is
too
bad
as
i
love
pumpkin
beers
and
had
high
hopes
for
this
i
tried
it
on
multiple
occassions
but
its
not
getting
any
better
overall
a
medium
bodied
beer
very
drinkable
and
a
good
seasonal
fall
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
attempt
at
a
sessionable
pumpkin
alternative
beer
a
bit
heavy
on
the
roasted
bitter
flavors
dont
work
quite
right
with
the
pumpkin
spicing
a
more
balanced
chocolate
malt
flavor
would
have
been
a
better
complement
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
during
the
fall
seasons
but
wont
seek
it
out
either
o
overall
i
was
pretty
bummed
about
this
beer
i
expected
it
to
be
nice
considering
that
it
is
a
fresh
seasonal
pumpkin
beer
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
porter
as
well
but
i
guess
ill
be
left
at
the
curb
on
that
one
overall
meh
its
not
bad
its
just
not
that
great
its
a
subpar
porter
but
a
decent
enough
pumpkin
ale
i
like
the
idea
of
making
a
pumpkin
porter
rather
than
a
traditional
pumpkin
ale
but
i
think
it
could
be
done
better
than
this
although
this
style
is
not
my
favorite
boxcar
is
definitely
my
favorite
pumpkin
offering
so
far
id
definitely
recommend
it
but
only
with
the
graham
crackers
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
particularly
good
one
either
the
spices
take
a
backseat
to
the
malts
and
the
pumpkin
is
nowhere
to
be
found
that
being
said
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
the
smoky
flavor
and
spices
make
it
a
pleasant
fall
beer
overall
a
beer
i
certainly
wont
go
to
again
the
flavors
had
no
compatibilitymelding
in
this
brew
and
resulted
it
too
off
a
flavor
o
although
i
marked
it
down
slightly
for
failing
to
fully
live
up
to
the
porter
name
it
was
a
tasty
and
refreshing
beverage
that
came
highly
recommended
from
the
beer
cicerone
at
the
store
and
one
that
id
recommend
highly
to
anyone
looking
for
a
pumpkin
beer
sadly
i
grabbed
the
last
bottle
on
the
shelf
in
the
store
for
i
would
have
eagerly
gone
back
for
more
of
this
excellent
example
of
the
style
o
i
was
wondering
where
starr
hill
was
going
to
take
this
as
a
pumpkinporter
beer
i
would
not
consider
it
a
porter
almost
no
flavor
of
roasted
malts
though
obviously
enough
to
make
it
dark
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
i
divide
them
into
two
categories
spiceheavy
beers
and
pumpkinheavy
beers
this
is
a
decent
spiceheavy
beer
though
i
think
better
described
as
a
black
lager
with
pumpkin
spices
overall
this
is
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
i
guess
i
was
expcecting
something
with
a
strong
chocolate
taste
that
a
porter
usually
has
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
in
it
instead
it
just
taste
like
water
with
cinamaon
and
nutmeg
sprinkled
in
it
i
am
a
little
disappointed
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
beer
and
hope
i
will
find
something
better
o
very
nicely
done
pumpkin
beer
highly
enjoyable
overall
a
unique
beer
which
is
memorable
but
could
be
better
overall
a
nice
brew
o
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
d
enjoyable
porter
but
needs
more
pumpkin
flavor
to
live
up
to
the
name
still
worth
trying
overall
a
decent
robust
porter
with
a
very
nice
aroma
although
there
was
more
pumpkin
and
spices
in
the
aroma
than
there
was
in
the
flavor
this
one
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
thanks
to
travisnd
for
sending
this
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
pumpkin
and
spices
taste
is
also
pumpkin
pie
up
front
some
roasted
malts
well
balanced
and
tasty
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
somewhat
watery
with
carbonation
being
high
didnt
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
for
the
style
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
great
pumpkin
beer
the
roasty
bitter
flavors
just
didnt
work
well
with
the
spices
for
me
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
chocolate
sweeter
malty
flavors
coming
out
of
the
porter
instead
the
flavors
just
didnt
really
compliment
each
other
very
well
with
all
the
great
portersstouts
out
there
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
o
overall
this
beer
is
just
ok
an
average
beer
that
gives
alot
of
promise
in
the
smell
but
not
much
in
the
flavor
d
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
abv
does
not
seem
any
more
than
5
nice
mix
of
pumpkin
and
coffee
another
good
beer
from
starr
hill
overall
not
enough
flavor
and
way
too
thin
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
oh
well
if
youre
new
to
pimpkin
beers
or
dark
porters
in
general
this
isnt
a
bad
one
to
try
if
youre
looking
for
some
big
roasted
malt
or
strong
pumpkin
flavors
go
elsewhere
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
seems
more
like
a
failed
experiment
than
a
bad
beer
not
awful
just
misguided
o
not
so
great
note
to
owner
i
want
to
like
your
brews
i
really
do
as
a
dcvirginia
native
ill
give
your
brewery
as
many
chances
as
i
can
possibly
stomach
so
come
on
put
your
heart
into
and
create
something
really
special
like
what
youve
done
with
your
monticello
reserve
even
if
i
personally
hate
it
im
sure
to
taste
the
love
and
passion
put
into
the
product
because
as
it
stands
all
i
typically
taste
is
mediocrity
taste
is
an
unusual
mix
of
roasty
malts
and
pumpkin
spice
very
flavorful
and
lighter
in
body
than
expected
i
was
not
sure
how
the
porter
would
gel
with
the
pumpkin
but
this
one
works
just
fine
enjoyable
m
too
much
carbonation
not
very
smooth
or
full
bodied
like
i
would
expect
from
a
porterstout
o
im
glad
i
tried
this
but
wouldnt
go
for
it
again
tasty
interesting
a
nice
mix
up
from
the
typical
pumpkin
fall
beer
but
overall
it
wasnt
great
overall
the
word
unexceptional
comes
to
mind
it
was
good
but
not
great
id
have
it
again
only
if
it
were
on
tap
overall
an
interesting
idea
that
doesnt
really
come
off
very
well
in
my
opinion
as
the
flavors
tend
to
clash
and
the
medicinal
element
adds
an
offflavor
that
is
disconcerting
very
drinkable
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
but
if
its
any
higher
than
5
its
hidden
quite
well
inside
of
the
deliciousness
of
this
offering
o
the
boxcar
is
a
nice
seasonal
from
starr
hill
while
its
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
it
is
a
nice
twist
and
a
welcome
addition
to
the
fall
seasonal
lineup
the
only
real
drawback
is
the
thinness
of
the
beer
which
is
something
i
hope
they
work
on
in
subsequent
years
it
is
tasty
though
and
something
id
have
again
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
thin
disappearing
tan
head
instant
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
with
sweet
malt
caramel
and
vegetal
pumpkin
notes
like
most
pumpkin
beers
just
perhaps
a
bit
more
roasty
the
flavor
is
definitely
more
porter
than
pumpkin
like
although
there
is
a
distinct
and
very
tasty
pumpkin
pie
aftertaste
otherwise
roasted
malt
and
caramel
flavors
medium
body
with
a
smooth
carbonated
mouthfeel
i
thought
i
would
be
disappointed
like
with
most
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
is
a
pretty
nice
combination
especially
with
the
great
pumpkin
aftertaste
o
fairly
absent
of
anything
that
could
be
construed
as
decent
balance
i
so
very
wanted
to
like
this
but
it
wasnt
to
be
id
love
to
be
more
of
a
homer
for
local
beers
but
this
one
is
tough
to
take
such
a
stand
but
they
gave
the
pumpkin
genre
a
shot
and
even
did
it
with
a
less
mimicked
style
going
porter
so
heres
to
constructive
criticism
that
inspires
them
to
retool
this
for
next
year
overall
nice
idea
and
good
try
on
it
but
just
wasnt
where
i
like
a
pumpkin
beer
to
be
i
could
drink
a
couple
in
one
sitting
but
why
would
i
i
feel
like
a
quick
dash
of
pumpkin
was
dropped
in
an
average
porter
recipe
o
a
pretty
bland
boring
beer
with
an
odd
tartness
in
the
middle
neither
the
porter
nor
the
pumpkin
aspects
of
this
beer
really
stand
out
and
it
ultimately
just
falls
flat
picked
up
at
total
wine
more
for
1
99
had
to
try
a
pumpkin
porter
but
this
was
not
such
a
great
introductory
pours
black
with
one
finger
of
light
tan
foam
with
decent
retention
aromas
are
entirely
pumpkin
spicy
cloves
cinnamon
etc
but
not
the
slightest
whiff
of
anything
that
would
tell
a
blind
man
he
was
sniffing
an
ale
which
is
a
total
failure
in
my
book
flavors
are
roasty
and
pumpkin
pie
like
with
a
typical
porter
finish
the
majority
of
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
tried
taste
better
than
this
as
do
the
majority
of
porters
in
the
end
the
whole
is
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
downplaying
the
spices
andor
an
intensifying
of
the
primary
malts
would
greatly
enhance
this
beer
this
has
been
getting
great
word
of
mouth
in
virginia
i
grew
up
down
the
street
from
starr
hill
and
they
finally
knocked
one
out
of
the
park
pours
an
appetizing
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
aroma
is
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
toasted
malt
taste
is
complex
with
the
roasted
malt
bringing
out
the
pumpkin
spices
not
as
tasty
as
the
smell
but
still
good
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
balanced
to
bring
out
the
flavor
overall
this
is
a
resounding
success
for
starr
hill
great
job
guys
and
gals
o
the
idea
of
this
brew
was
definitely
better
than
its
full
realization
still
its
a
nice
brew
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
pumpkin
ale
mo
very
well
balanced
beer
the
pumpkin
flavor
has
some
nice
flavor
but
the
pumpkin
really
smooths
out
the
bitterness
of
the
porter
great
tasting
and
easy
to
drink
overall
an
interesting
brew
i
would
really
like
to
see
these
guys
push
the
envelope
a
little
farther
namely
i
want
more
real
pumpkin
flavor
it
was
a
good
beer
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
sweet
pumpkin
and
spice
taste
but
it
was
well
balanced
i
will
buy
this
one
again
a
tasty
porter
which
would
be
even
better
in
the
fall
pumpkin
porter
has
been
done
before
this
one
is
unexceptional
pours
a
very
deep
brown
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
and
some
strong
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
thin
collar
throughout
the
nose
carries
a
good
amount
of
spice
though
its
balanced
by
some
nice
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
pumpkin
character
comes
through
a
bit
though
its
more
from
the
spicing
the
flavor
carries
some
roasted
malt
and
pumpkinpie
spice
also
there
is
a
good
amount
of
dark
chocolate
medium
body
with
a
nice
cask
carbonation
slight
spice
in
the
finish
well
done
pours
dark
redbrown
almost
black
only
intense
light
permeates
extremely
shortlived
creamytan
head
aroma
is
entirely
malty
tastes
much
more
like
a
hearty
nut
brown
ale
than
other
porters
ive
had
lacks
the
bitterness
usually
associated
with
porters
and
stouts
light
bitterness
usually
achieved
with
coffee
or
cocoa
nibs
hop
flavors
almost
absent
carbonation
is
mild
making
for
mellow
sipping
very
enjoyable
love
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
only
complaint
is
that
it
feels
a
tiny
bit
thin
an
excellent
porter
overall
great
taste
and
feel
creamy
with
a
great
finish
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
recommend
ale
asylum
to
anyone
looking
for
an
all
around
good
brew
the
chocolate
does
move
beyond
powdery
and
there
is
balance
to
it
its
a
nice
enough
porter
overall
serving
type
bottle
very
good
beer
as
awesome
as
ale
asylum
is
with
the
hoppier
beers
i
think
they
are
struggling
with
the
darker
ones
the
contorter
porter
is
ok
the
beer
poured
a
nice
almost
opaque
dark
with
decent
head
that
left
some
lacing
the
scent
carried
some
earth
and
roasty
tones
the
taste
was
similar
to
watered
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
in
body
with
subtle
carbonation
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
porters
but
for
those
who
like
a
lighter
porter
this
might
be
for
you
overall
i
picked
up
a
single
of
this
to
try
as
i
enjoy
most
porters
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
though
thin
feel
and
dry
finish
are
the
opposite
of
what
i
like
in
porters
ill
try
some
of
the
other
ale
asylum
beers
but
probably
wont
return
to
this
one
o
a
pleasant
porter
and
easily
sessioned
more
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
offensive
a
surprisingly
tasty
brew
and
im
looking
forward
to
see
what
else
this
brewery
has
to
offer
o
contorter
porter
is
one
of
those
sinisterlooking
dark
beers
thats
no
where
near
as
aggressive
as
it
first
appears
it
might
not
be
immediately
approachable
but
this
is
a
dark
beer
thats
got
good
flavor
without
really
packing
a
wallop
or
being
too
thick
its
an
easydrinking
porter
that
would
fit
right
in
with
the
english
session
ales
a
few
at
your
favorite
pub
wouldnt
be
a
bad
start
to
the
night
overall
what
it
lacks
in
appearance
and
mouthfeel
its
basically
a
thin
bodied
porter
it
makes
up
to
a
certain
extent
in
flavour
and
nose
two
rather
related
things
not
the
most
complex
porter
but
it
is
tasty
and
smells
good
despite
having
a
watery
thin
body
i
liked
its
drinkability
and
flavours
but
it
does
have
a
lot
of
room
for
improvement

this

nice

dark

with
ruby

toasted

at

very
nice

upfront
taste
is
nice
chocolately
malt
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
however
this
is
a
bit
shortlived
as
the
end
note
is
slightly
carbonic
and
lacks
a
malty
fullbodied
finish
easy
to
drink
with
decent
flavor
a
solid
sessionable
english
style
porter
that
lacks
depth
but
makes
up
for
it
in
drinkability
o4
00
o
awesome
english
complexity
to
this
beer
sans
oxidative
properties
great
look
to
it
and
pouring
over
with
aroma
taste
had
a
thin
feel
to
it
that
i
greatly
enjoyed
it
wasnt
really
creamy
nor
sweet
but
still
had
dimensions
of
maltiness
to
it
it
did
however
have
a
finish
that
of
a
cigarette
ash
that
was
unusual
allinall
a
great
interpretation
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
porter
it
was
probably
my
favorite
of
the
three
ale
asylum
beers
i
tried
that
weekend
easy
to
drink
and
a
ton
going
on
worth
checking
out
pour
is
black
with
light
tan
head
and
lots
of
large
bubbles
nose
is
light
fudge
and
chocolate
cake
notes
of
tobacco
and
roast
with
a
light
green
finish
taste
is
much
thinner
more
roasted
and
leathery
tobacco
thin
finish
and
assertive
carbonation
not
as
put
together
and
rich
in
the
flavor
but
not
bad
contorter
porter
isnt
bad
per
se
that
said
in
the
company
of
so
many
goodtogreat
porters
its
subpar
and
ultimately
forgettable

d
tasty
beer
this
is
how
i
prefer
my
porters
with
a
little
girth
on
them
bottle
at
jordans
big
10
pub
this
is
a
disappointment
i
think
im
learning
i
dont
like
porters
maybe
a
couple
years
ago
before
moving
to
madison
and
getting
acclimated
to
the
big
fullbodied
belgians
and
imperial
stouts
so
im
maybe
not
the
right
person
to
review
this
beer
its
just
too
light
weight
i
think
its
the
dark
appearance
that
makes
me
want
so
much
more
i
suppose
if
i
were
in
houston
on
a
hot
day
id
appreciate
the
sessionability
but
its
70
degrees
w
0
humidity
here
in
glorious
madsion
overall
a
very
solid
porter
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
fan
of
chocolatey
beers
but
otherwise
unremarkable
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
brown
color
black
in
low
light
the
head
was
tan
and
faded
rather
quickly
just
leaving
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
big
roasted
burnt
malt
aromas
blended
with
some
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
rich
chocolaty
start
with
bitter
lager
like
note
in
the
finish
with
some
additional
charred
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
softer
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
solid
porter
there
isnt
too
much
to
fuss
over
on
this
one
o
pretty
well
done
just
reminds
me
that
i
prefer
stouts
over
porters
but
as
far
as
porters
go
this
is
a
great
one
o
a
well
balanced
porter
bottle
bought
is
wisconsin
pours
black
with
a
thickish
oily
look
bold
chocolate
and
roast
aromas
i
got
more
chocolate
than
coffee
in
flavour
both
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
came
from
the
cholate
a
good
example
of
a
solid
american
porter
good
drinkability
and
way
to
end
the
meal
o
an
average
beer
with
above
and
below
average
characteristics
m
light
to
medium
body
slightly
creamy
moderate
carbonation
an
extra
from
a
trade
with
taturbo
thanks
again
man
this
one
pours
out
dark
as
night
but
with
some
brown
hues
on
the
edges
a
small
khaki
head
up
top
rounds
it
off
real
nice
nose
on
this
porter
making
a
statement
with
its
english
qualities
bready
nutty
chocolatey
and
sweet
caramel
here
big
aroma
in
comparison
to
the
taste
though
that
came
up
a
bit
short
for
me
bready
chocolate
forward
with
a
carbonation
bite
in
the
aftertaste
no
discernable
hops
to
note
tastewise
but
i
do
get
the
bittering
a
good
bit
only
complaint
is
that
i
wish
the
taste
had
matched
the
nose
rough
to
have
a
better
nose
than
taste
o
not
very
complex
but
very
good
for
what
it
is
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
winter
beer
though
its
still
40
degrees
outside
in
minnesota
in
january
another
good
beer
from
ale
asylum
on
tap
at
aa
served
in
a
shaker
pint
very
dark
brown
in
color
almost
black
but
not
quite
served
with
only
a
minimal
bit
of
almost
tan
head
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
of
chocolate
and
little
else
taste
is
of
lightly
roasted
malts
and
milk
chocolate
with
a
watery
finish
medium
bodied
but
feels
lighter
than
it
is
lower
carbonation
mild
bitterness
a
better
than
average
porter
though
a
rather
simplistic
one
o
a
nice
porter
for
whatever
reason
maybe
the
chocolate
notes
and
creamy
texture
it
really
pairs
well
with
a
cold
wisconsin
night
and
a
warm
fire
be
sure
to
enjoy
on
the
warmer
side
to
let
the
roasty
notes
shine
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
i
think
there
are
other
porters
out
there
that
are
more
in
your
face
but
this
one
is
subtle
and
complex
and
extremely
smooth
a
very
nice
beer
from
ale
asylum
o
a
nice
aroma
to
this
and
a
fairly
good
flavor
too
just
a
bit
watery
o
very
sessionable
and
has
a
wonderful
nose
but
doesnt
quite
hit
the
sweet
spot
that
sn
or
founders
porters
do
and
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
disappointing
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
phenomenal
one
either
pours
a
deep
black
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
lighted
edges
tan
head
lingers
nicely
on
top
for
quite
a
while
light
chocolate
and
roast
in
the
nose
without
much
else
maybe
a
light
hop
note
in
the
middle
of
the
bready
base
smooth
is
the
selling
point
on
the
bottle
and
the
website
description
and
it
is
very
smooth
with
little
to
stop
it
from
going
dryly
off
the
back
of
the
tongue
quickly
roast
is
light
and
lingers
a
bit
on
the
tongue
but
the
thin
body
detracts
from
the
overall
taste
while
a
decent
porter
it
lacks
enough
depth
to
keep
me
interested
beyond
a
bottle
or
two
had
the
same
beer
on
tap
recently
and
it
seemed
to
have
a
bit
more
too
it
then
for
some
reason
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
molasses
taste
is
similarly
rich
with
just
the
edge
of
bitterness
and
a
light
fizzyness
molasses
flavor
dominates
but
theres
chocolate
too
not
nutty
or
roasty
but
faintly
sweet
with
no
gross
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
thin
and
not
overcarbonated
a
real
classic
porter
a
solid
and
consistent
ab
o
good
run
of
the
mill
porter
i
would
not
seek
it
out
but
would
not
turn
it
down
overall
a
basic
and
conservative
porter
that
will
easily
be
forgotten
d
decent
stuff
i
have
had
better
but
it
was
still
pretty
solid
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
watery
i
really
think
i
would
have
liked
this
one
a
lot
more
this
beer
poured
a
black
colored
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
was
very
strong
of
coffee
the
taste
had
alot
of
coffee
flavors
but
was
also
heavy
and
malty
a
bit
of
a
carmel
flavor
as
well
but
the
coffee
flavors
stood
out
the
most
nice
full
flavor
espically
for
a
porter
overall
a
found
it
a
good
beer
and
a
really
good
porter
d
i
wont
drink
more
than
one
of
these
but
nice
on
a
cold
winter
night
drinks
terrifically
i
could
easily
put
a
couple
of
these
back
represents
the
style
well
all
around
this
beer
is
really
well
done
with
the
exception
of
the
head
which
i
can
live
with
pours
a
deep
brown
basically
black
with
a
small
head
and
some
lace
the
aroma
is
some
coffee
a
little
cinnamon
some
roasty
malt
some
candy
sweetness
a
mild
hoppiness
and
something
odd
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
flavor
is
much
like
a
delicious
coffee
drink
with
some
mild
sweetness
some
fruitiness
a
nice
bitter
hoppiness
with
a
good
creamy
character
pours
a
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
very
nice
chocolatetoffee
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
nice
touch
of
chocolatetoffee
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
english
porter
d
im
impressed
with
this
one
a
good
porter
that
relies
on
malty
craft
to
deliver
solid
flavor
do
drink
two
and
call
it
a
night
for
this
beer
anyways
would
drink
again
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
some
chocolate
and
a
mild
hop
finish
mouth
feel
is
not
very
carbonated
but
clean
drinkability
is
good
with
a
nice
clean
finish
as
well
really
solid
brew
from
ale
asylum
the
first
two
ive
had
from
them
have
been
fantastic
which
makes
me
glad
to
be
in
wisconsin
right
now
d
big
drinkabilty
i
love
porters
and
this
is
a
wonderful
a
bit
carbonated
and
no
sourness
associated
with
traditional
english
porters
but
a
fine
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
an
oil
like
black
color
with
a
thin
body
and
a
bubbly
not
creamy
light
brown
head
that
left
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
caramel
subtle
chocolate
and
burnt
malts
the
taste
was
overly
carbonated
upfront
astringent
to
the
tongue
and
full
of
the
burnt
malt
flavor
there
was
not
much
to
come
out
from
under
the
deep
dark
malt
taste
some
slight
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
difficult
to
get
to
behind
the
heaviness
of
the
roast
this
was
a
little
thin
for
the
style
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
worth
a
try
inky
dark
brown
body
with
a
small
bubbly
sandy
brown
head
not
much
lacing
roasted
malts
light
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
dominate
the
nose
some
minor
notes
of
vanilla
and
charred
wood
grainy
bitterness
up
front
chocolate
and
peaty
malt
sweetness
follows
slight
notes
of
coffee
and
oily
woody
fruit
moderate
body
with
a
lively
feel
not
bad
d
goes
down
very
easy
a
nice
session
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
a
good
example
of
an
english
porter
well
worth
trying
very
drinkable
as
a
session
porter
just
not
very
complex
maybe
a
good
dinner
beer
where
the
food
shines
over
the
beer
enjoyed
on
tap
at
ale
asylum
in
madison
wi
pours
a
black
body
with
a
tan
head
that
lasts
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
the
main
flavor
is
sweet
roasted
malts
with
a
very
low
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
good
drinkability
this
really
brought
the
roasted
feel
hard
with
the
type
of
burnt
grains
and
coffee
character
that
i
really
like
in
the
style
the
body
could
have
used
a
touch
more
presence
but
for
the
most
part
this
was
a
one
dark
tasty
and
nicely
drinkable
porter
ultimately
this
beer
gets
lost
amongst
two
world
class
porters
i
have
access
to
great
lakes
edmund
fitz
and
founders
still
a
worthy
effort
from
an
up
and
coming
brewery
d
very
smooth
for
a
porter
could
drink
all
night
the
contorter
is
another
good
beer
from
the
ale
asylum
my
hats
off
to
the
folks
in
madison
for
turning
out
a
good
drinkable
porter
taste
unfortunately
does
not
live
up
to
expectations
the
first
note
is
bitterness
which
the
chocolate
coming
up
next
followed
up
by
heavilyroasted
malt
and
ending
with
more
bitterness
a
lot
of
fizz
on
the
tongue
as
well
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
many
of
these
in
succession
i
might
have
another
beer
but
it
would
be
another
beer
i
generally
like
my
porters
sweeter
and
more
fullbodied
than
this
one
not
recommended
very
nice
english
style
porter
the
chunk
of
flaked
malt
floating
in
the
beer
were
attractive
to
my
eye
but
may
turn
some
off
drinkability
suffers
as
this
beer
felt
a
little
heavy
for
a
session
which
is
what
a
porter
was
meant
to
be
d
goes
down
easy
pretty
good
beer
one
of
their
best
i
think
poured
with
a
tan
head
and
some
lace
opaque
dark
blackish
brown
nice
roasty
malty
nose
with
a
little
dark
ripe
fruit
cocoa
coffee
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
flavor
is
very
similar
and
yet
fairly
dry
in
spite
of
the
richness
its
fairly
drinkable
but
at
the
same
time
very
full
flavored
so
other
flavors
in
my
mouth
clashed
a
bit
nice
finish
with
no
off
flavors
not
too
boozy
label
reminds
me
of
thailand
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
englishstyle
porter
easy
drinking
and
tasty
loaded
with
flavor
and
aromatics
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
tasty
porter
d
nice
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
in
the
beginning
that
are
squandered
by
the
strange
mouthfeel
d
easy
drinking
overall
a
solid
choice
the
body
is
moderate
there
is
a
slick
quality
that
could
be
diacetyl
but
i
didnt
pick
it
out
in
the
taste
overall
a
good
porter
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
flyingbison
for
the
trade
black
beer
with
a
thin
brown
head
couldnt
get
much
of
a

with
a

is

the
nose
is
full
of
rich
chocolate
english

at

done
a

job
with

porter
while
it
doesnt
venture
out
of
the
safe
cozy
confines
of
the
style
its
tasty
as
hell
and
is
unlikely
to
lose
its
charm
over
the
course
of
multiple
bottles
in
fact
i
could
go
for
a
few
more
right
now
i
would
recommend
this
beer

this

at

d
definitely
a
keeper
da
solid

not

to

about
with

some

works
well
for
session
purposes

is
not

i
like
my
porter
but
that
also
added
a
lot
to
its

making
it
a
nice
summer
choice
taste
is
also
dominated
by
cocoa
and
coffee

overall
getting
this
for
5
29
i
find
it
somewhat
overpriced
i
have
had
better
porters
at
a
more
affordable
price
o
a
very
good
english
porter
with
exceptional
taste
and
aroma
improved
a
bit
with
warming
despite
starting
at
about
55f
notes
ive
had
many
english
porters
and
this
one
ranks
near
the
top
aromatic
flavorful
and
very
well
balanced
bitterness
is
slightly
more
pronounced
in
this
one
which
is
welcome
to
act
as
a
counterpoint
to
all
the
other
flavors
zinging
around
my
taste
buds
this
one
is
a
keeper
brewed
from
a
london
recipe
that
dates
back
to
1750
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
novice
beer
drinkers
should
be
forced
to
drink
in
order
to
experience
the
porter
beer
style
delicious
serve
at
a
cellar
temperature
to
maximize
your
enjoyment
poured
from
a
550ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
coded
bottle
date
this
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
large
mocha
colored
head
which
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
a
little
light
a
slight
hint
of
dark
roasted
malts
more
toffee
and
perhaps
a
little
nuts
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
decent
you
get
a
got
amount
of
toffee
some
nutty
flavors
and
then
a
little
dark
roasted
malts
overall
a
decent
beer
not
great
for
my
tastes
though
old
growler
hits
the
mark
with
this
dark
offering
its
a
reasonably
choice
if
youre
looking
for
a
porter
thats
not
so
robust
overall
a
weak
porter
for
my
taste
but
i
will
give
it
another
try
i
have
no
idea
what
to
make
of
this
brew
so
im
marking
it
average
some
folks
may
love
this
flavor
profile
for
me
however
after
it
struck
me
where
i
had
smelled
these
smells
before
i
couldnt
go
back
interesting
brew
but
not
for
me
o
great
beer
not
over
top
but
worthy
of
multiple
purchases
0
not
a
bad
porter
howerver
at
5
dollars
there
are
better
picks
out
there
worthy
of
a
try
o
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
this
beer
but
it
is
a
nicely
made
drinkable
brew
would
buy
again
and
split
a
bottle
with
the
missus
smooth
pour
in
tall
mug
not
to
much
head
nice
color
with
a
malty
coffee
smell
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
the
taste
was
smooth
from
the
start
and
not
as
bitter
as
many
porters
on
the
first
taste
smooth
and
delicious
not
overly
strong
in
any
way
would
be
great
with
a
meal
nice
pot
roast
or
maybe
a
french
dip
but
unfortunately
this
is
done
as
an
after
dinner
brew
something
to
plan
for
next
time
will
for
sure
buy
this
one
again
good
lighter
side
of
mid
bodied
and
fairly
lively
still
coats
almost
creamy
drinks
very
easily
spot
on
english
style
brown
ale
porter
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
cola
brown
with
a
nice
puff
of
offwhite
head
that
retained
well
and
left
just
a
bit
of
lacing
behind
interesting
aroma
kind
of
reminiscent
of
some
of
the
sour
porters
ive
been
seeing
around
lately
dark
roasty
malts
yeast
dark
dried
fruits
wasnt
sure
at
first
if
it
was
offflavored
or
supposed
to
taste
that
way
but
reading
other
reviews
i
suppose
the
taste
is
on
it
wasnt
that
it
was
bad
just
a
bit
unexpected
resembled
a
typical
porter
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
cocoacoffee
notes
hints
of
tobacco
but
there
was
a
definite
yeasty
quality
and
an
infusion
of
raisin
and
citrus
flavors
that
almost
made
it
seem
like
a
tripel
had
been
blended
in
there
interesting
mediumbodied
and
fairly
drinkable
but
only
if
i
was
really
in
the
mood
to
try
it
again
good
porter
all
around
texture
taste
and
aroma
are
a
delight
a
good
porter
for
sure
not
sure
if
it
is
the
supreme
champion
like
it
says
on
the
label
but
worth
trying
and
really
brings
a
nice
english
feel
to
the
porter
the
cpj
cheers
overall
decent
nice
dry
creamy
irish
stout
light
dry
saison
like
farmhouse
rustic
almost
funk
my
house
guests
found
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
but
i
found
it
to
be
appropriate
theres
a
good
dose
of
hop
but
this
story
is
about
the
toasted
malt
an
overall
smooth
beer
relatively
dry
the
carbonation
seemed
a
bit
low
producing
only
a
moments
worth
of
lighttan
head
before
falling
to
wisps
this
seems
to
have
held
up
quite
well
in
the
beerfrigerator
in
evidence
a
deep
brown
color
with
cola
highlights
nose
had
a
smoky
anise
quality
very
nice
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
tastes
of
dried
dark
fruit
smoke
charcoal
anise
and
dark
chocolate
in
the
mouth
i
was
liking
this
even
more
than
the
earlier
taddy
porter
finish
was
semidry
with
an
intense
smokiness
that
not
only
stole
the
show
but
lingered
well
after
the
swallow
the
other
flavors
remained
in
evidence
but
it
was
the
charcoalsmoke
flavor
that
dominated
was
it
the
inadvertent
aging
that
created
this
i
do
not
know
because
i
have
not
reviewed
it
fresh
but
this
was
a
winner
its
so
very
dull
goes
down
easy
with
a
whimper
o
very
drinkable
and
tasty
4
notes
the
coffee
sweetness
is
not
exactly
my
thing
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
comes
together
rather
nicely
a
good
brew
finish
is
medium
bitter
espresso
and
lightly
burned
coffee
nice
drink
and
very
appealing
you
want
to
keep
drinking
it
it
pours
a
quick
head
that
crowns
a
body
of
pitch
black
there
is
little
carbonation
and
a
minimum
of
lace
the
nose
is
overwhelmed
by
strong
waft
of
molasses
while
the
palate
receives
a
hearty
molasses
bite
that
fades
into
a
subtly
sweet
maltiness
the
old
growlers
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
yet
the
body
itself
is
suprisingly
light
a
smoothly
balanced
example
of
the
style
grrr
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
flavor
but
it
is
just
a
bit
to
muted
this
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
just
a
bit
more
depth
or
character
could
really
add
some
excitement
there
are
some
very
subtle
characters
that
i
just
cant
pin
down
but
i
think
on
tap
or
cask
it
might
really
bring
those
characters
out
taste
has
many
of
the
same
attributes
as
the
nose
and
has
a
chocolate
covered
raisin
flavor
that
is
pretty
typical
of
a
british
porter
some
roast
comes
out
as
well
as
some
lighter
fruit
almost
like
a
melon
salad
very
tasty
beverage
and
finishes
pretty
dry
despite
a
decent
amount
of
sweetness
up
front
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
touch
of
chalkboard
to
it
while
i
think
i
like
taddy
porter
from
samuel
smiths
a
little
better
old
growler
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
and
again
i
am
quickly
coming
to
realize
that
english
porters
might
be
in
my
top
15
favorite
styles
overall
i
though
the
name
and
picture
on
the
bottle
were
very
appropriate
this
beer
had
an
ashtray
and
cigarettes
quality
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
it
reminded
me
of
a
smoky
ol
pool
hall
this
brew
made
me
want
to
smoke
a
cigar
it
was
not
bad
and
i
enjoyed
the
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
id
probably
buy
this
again
and
would
happily
revisit
it
but
for
now
im
glad
i
tried
it
ill
be
moving
on
all
round
a
decent
representation
of
an
old
school
porter
chocolate
bitumen
and
cocoa
on
the
nose
surprisingly
thin
in
the
mouth
given
the
abv
a
little
grainy
and
powdery
some
more
of
the
cocoa
fairly
pleasant
though
not
particularly
memorable
would
have
again
but
not
at
theprice
i
paid9
500ml
d
a
deliciously
dark
ale
that
packs
a
heavywweight
punch
in
its
taste
this
is
certainly
a
beer
to
enjoy
d
its
an
easy
drinking
porter
would
be
a
satisfying
dark
lager
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
poured
a
very
attractive
dark
brownblack
color
with
athick
offwhitetan
head
that
stayed
for
quite
some
time
the
aroma
was
malty
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
and
licorice
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasant
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
one
good
stuff
d
the
taste
is
ok
the
low
carbonation
makes
it
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
on
par
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
i
find
the
carbonation
to
be
a
little
strong
and
the
body
a
touch
thin
very
enjoyable
none
the
less
its
a
good
simple
roasty
beer
that
deserves
a
nod
drinkability
truth
told
the
one
kind
of
grew
on
me
a
subtle
wellbalanced
easily
drinkable
porter
either
a
bit
light
and
pale
for
an
english
porter
or
a
throwback
to
the
roots
of
the
style
still
a
very
drinkable
winter
quaffer
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
beige
head
aroma
is
english
malts
and
hops
with
some
roasted
malts
as
well
flavor
is
definitely
english
with
roasted
malts
english
hops
and
a
slight
bit
of
coffee
at
the
end
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
decent
porter
which
i
was
surprised
by
with
the
lack
of
appearance
and
aroma
and
is
somewhat
complex
d
definitely
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
ill
be
looking
to
pick
this
up

sorry
i
just
discovered
wikipedias
color
entries
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
strong
caramel
malt
character
its
quite
sweet
with
hints
of
stone
fruits
im
not
getting
much
of
that
normal
ashy
character
that
i
enjoy
in
most
porters
but
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
the
aftertaste
seems
a
touch
off
but
i
cant
exactly
say
why
there
are
some
funny
english
hops
in
there
but
they
certainly
arent
the
stars
i
had
this
beer
marked
higher
nearly
across
the
board
after
initially
tasting
it
but
the
sweetness
is
really
wearing
for
me
my
tongue
is
almost
numb
as
i
get
to
the
last
quarter
of
the
beer
its
an
interesting
beer
and
im
glad
that
i
tried
it
but
the
first
sip
was
way
better
than
the
last
sip
and
that
doesnt
make
me
want
to
run
out
and
get
another
like
many
english
beers
i
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
from
a
cask
d
nicely
done
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
did
enjoy
and
would
be
opposed
to
having
again
as
change
up
to
my
usuals
overall
a
pretty
straightforward
porter
nothing
earth
shattering
but
well
worth
a
try
d
depends
on
why
youre
drinking
it
and
with
what
not
really
worth
the
us

we
paid
for
a
bottle
in
late
2007
drinkability
tasty
and
easy
drinking
i
could
put
away
a
couple
of
bottles
easily
for
the
price
i
paid
for
this
bottle
us1

its
a
hell
of
a
deal
btw
the
head
sharnk
some
but
theres
still
some
left
at
the
end
of
the
session
and
lacing
is
above
average
deep
brown
not
black
tan
head
retained
fairly
well
lacing
a
decent
pattern
in
the
form
of
rings
not
as
aromatic
as
some
porters
a
faint
but
inviting
chocolate
like
maltiness
complex
tastes
that
changed
with
each
sip
before
settling
down
to
a
solid
consistent
chocolate
toned
taste
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
roasty
a
real
drinkable
porter
that
some
might
not
find
assertive
enough
i
hope
i
can
find
this
on
cask
during
my
upcoming
trip
to
the
u
k
tasted

d
this
is
a
fullbodied
porter
with
a
silkysmooth
mouthfeel
consistently
very
different
from
the
caskversion
but
very
enjoyable
pours
totally
dark
brown
with
a
slight
brown
tinted
head
the
nose
is
caramel
roasted
malts
and
sweet
malts
in
the

there
is

vanilla
bean
sweet

its
medium
bodied
low
and
smoothe
carbo
very
thin
tasting
im
not
the
biggest
english
ale
fan
glad
i
got
to
have
this
in
a
bottle
just
as
good
as
the
cask
version
4s
all
round
again
drinkability
without
the
metal
this
would
have
been
a
very
solid
porter
even
with
it
here
it
was
quite
drinkable
maybe
an
off
bottle
d
this
is
a
great
tasting
porter
in
the
english
tradition
i
recommend
this
if
you
are
a
fan
of
fullers
and
samuel
smiths
taddy
porter
the
drinkability
is
so
nice
since
it
is
complex
deliciously
smooth
and
earthy
the
drinkability
is
enhanced
for
me
by
abv
and
this
is
quite
the
dark
gem
at
the
strength
poured
a
deep
brown
with
an
average
tan
head
nose
had
hints
of
chocolate
with
english
malts
taste
was
of
roasted
and
english
malts
chocolate
caramel
and
really
malty
it
was
very
smooth
going
down
and
left
me
with
a
smooth
malty
and
chocolate
taste
a
good
porter
overall
too
bad
i
am
not
much
on
english
brews
because
i
cant
stand
english
malts
i
like
this
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
could
drink
this
anytime
of
the
year
i
have
had
better
but
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
this
again
not
as
dark
as
some
porters
i
like
to
drink
such
as
sierra
nevada
or
sam
smiths
taddy
more
light
coming
through
the
beer
than
i
would
expect
revealing
a
deep
amber
colour
a
good
quality
light
brown
head
that
lasts
to
the
end
of
the
pint
plenty
of
caramel
in
the
nose
with
some
chocoalte
maltiness
both
the
taste
and
the
feel
are
disappointingly
thin
im
not
looking
for
fireworks
here
but
i
like
a
beer
that
lets
me
know
im
drinking
it
and
i
have
to
say
that
this
ones
a
bit
lacking
in
that
respect
sadly
definitely
better
than
your
average
brew
but
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
its
smooth
complex
and
exceedingly
well
balanced
great
toffee
and
caramel
in
the
nose
of
this
one
nice
roasted
coffee
flavor
in
the
finish
some
elements
of
molasses
and
plum
as
well
overall
a
nice
brew
very
drinkable
and
i
can
see
why
it
has
as
many
followers
as
it
does
continues
to
be
one
of
the
popular
items
at
my
store
whenever
i
can
get
it
on
the
shelf
drinkability
very
good
i
would
recommend
everyone
who
likes
a
good
porter
to
try
this
this
brew
pored
to
a
nice
dark
brown
color
hedging
on
black
with
a
think
lighter
tan
head
head
had
some
legs
and
left
some
lacing
down
the
sides
the
aroma
seems
light
which
i
guess
surprised
me
a
little
what
was
there
was
chocolate
malt
in
nature
but
seemed
a
little
muted
but
was
more
noticeable
than
the
very
slight
coffee
note
the
taste
was
good
nice
malt
flavors
showcasing
both
roasted
and
chocolate
some
fruit
like
flavors
are
there
as
well
which
goes
nicely
easy
drinking
brew
quite
smooth
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
flavor
really
made
up
for
the
aroma
imo
the
ease
of
drinking
this
one
was
nice
made
you
wishing
for
more
not
close
to
the
best
i
have
had
but
a
solid
choice
overall
a
solid
english
porter
dont
think
it
rivals
the
alltime
greats
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
might
bump
the
roasted
character
up
a
tad
d
top
marks
here
whereas
some
porters
tange
it
up
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
the
old
growlers
smoother
bitterness
and
subtle
flavor
make
it
easy
to
let
a
few
of
these
slide
down
the
back
of
your
throat
in
one
sitting
often
in
america
it
is
hard
to
come
by
a
truly
exquisite
porter
at
least
in
the
average
beerwine
dive
i
popped
into
a
local
little
place
on
the
corner
near
my
house
and
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
porter
i
grabbed
up
a
couple
of
these
1
pint
bottles
and
headed
home
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
traditional
pint
glass
imperial
not
paltry
12
0z
and
was
blown
away
by
the
deep
rich
colour
of
this
beer
i
have
had
a
few
of
the
different
large
brand
attempts
a
porter
serria
nevada
yueng
ling
etc
but
this
was
by
far
the
best
i
could
find
the
head
was
decent
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
but
not
bad
the
taste
was
wonderful
very
rich
and
creamy
with
those
coffee
and
chocolate
nodes
that
porter
fans
adore
all
in
all
this
was
a
real
surprise
and
i
am
definitely
going
to
pick
this
beer
up
again
pours
out
a
dark
ruby
body
with
a
thick
ta
head
that
comes
off
looking
like
foamed
milk
on
a
coffee
leaves
cheets
of
thick
raised
lacing
smells
like
chocolate
syrup
with
fainter
coffee
notes
nice
bready
background
flavor
is
of
toasted
malts
up
front
and
the
flavors
that
initiate
this
remind
me
of
a
soft
brown
middle
is
vinous
and
of
dark
fruits
maybe
some
pomegranate
in
there
as
well
chocolate
finishes
this
up
with
some
raisins
and
dates
aftertaste
lingers
on
of
strong
coffee
and
light
smoke
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
the
body
is
somewhere
between
moderate
and
light
though
it
leans
towards
the
middle
this
is
really
quaffable
although
this
isnt
the
most
interesting
porter
i
could
session
this
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
with
no
lacing
the
smell
is
pungent
with
dark
fruitraisinsmolassesand
alittle
chocolate
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
dark
fruitmolassesbrown
sugarand
roasted
malt
make
this
a
very
drinkable
porter
the
mf
is
light
and
abit
thinbut
the
flavors
mix
well
making
this
a
very
easy
drinking
porter
and
a
nice
start
on
st
pattys
day
pours
a
deep
ruby
with
a
nice
tightly
packed
head
smells
pretty
tasty
sweet
molassess
dark
fruit
taste
much
like
the
nose
lightly
sweet
a
bit
dumbed
down
raisins
finishes
a
bit
metallic
thin
in
the
mouth
and
just
seems
mediocre
overall
one
is
enough
for
me
bummer
d
great
drinkability
fairly
complex
flavor
a
little
light
in
body
to
me
this
is
an
okay
porter
but
i
have
tried
better
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
this
one
has
some
odd
characteristics
like
raisin
in
the
smell
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
worth
a
try
note
this
example
was
the
export
strength
5
5
growler
not
the
original
a
repugnant
little
porter
it
is
quite
dogged
hehe
but
really
that
word
is
appropriate
this
is
porter
with
an
attitude
deep
chestnut
colour
no
real
head
a
great
blend
of
bitter
and
sweet
with
plenty
of
flavour
light
roast
ample
satisfaction
in
all
fields
all
in
all
i
have
enjoyed
this
very
much
the
taste
is
light
up
front
but
has
a
rich
concentrated
burnt
caramel
sweetness
that
certainly
leans
towards
toffee
at
times
it
finishes
with
an
exaggerated
malt
character
similar
to
the
malt
found
in
chocolatemaltball
candies
a
dry
note
comprised
of
a
touch
of
chalk
and
dark
chocolate
lingers
along
in
the
finish
along
with
a
toasty
yet
sweetish
malt
note
there
is
some
fruitiness
here
as
well
for
some
reason
i
want
to
say
i
taste
a
note
of
cherry
really
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
note
but
i
cant
really
say
why
i
definitely
taste
notes
of
figs
and
prunes
and
even
some
roasted
raisin
notes
but
not
sure
why
i
want
to
say
cherry
this
beer
is
quite
quaffable
it
is
light
on
the
tongue
but
has
a
depth
of
flavor
which
allows
it
to
linger
on
in
the
palate
this
is
quite
enjoyable
i
can
imagine
that
this
would
taste
quite
good
on
cask
not
my
favorite
style
by
far
but
this
mostly
hits
what
i
count
for
english
porter
got
a
bottle
of
this
in
houston
pours
fluffy
brown
with
a
surprizingly
white
head
head
settles
to
a
nice
creamy
layer
after
a
while
sweet
malty
unremarkable
odor
taste
is
very
smooth
slightly
burnt
malt
tasty
vague
nicely
subtle
hops
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
catch
and
a
fine
example
of
the
more
traditional
porter
crimson
hued
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
slight
head
that
all
but
lasts
a
couple
of
seconds
smell
is
of
toffee
or
caramel
with
a
chocolate
nose
aroma
is
somewhat
faint
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
taste
is
of
chocolatecaramel
malt
with
a
slight
citrus
tinge
malt
flavors
preside
over
the
other
ingredients
drinkability
is
derived
from
the
subdued
nature
of
flavors
which
is
not
to
say
it
is
a
good
thing
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
slippery
or
dare
i
say
watery
could
be
a
bit
more
aggressive
with
the
flavor
profile
worth
a
try
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
more
interesting
and
more
assertive
examples
of
the
style
out
there
drinks
pretty
tasty
but
a
shadow
of
the
cask
version
i
had
in
england
in
the
early
90s
dsmooth
and
with
5
5abv
lighter
and
more
drinkable
than
most
english
porters
ive
tried
overall
good
stuff
and
this
being
june
a
nice
choice
for
warmer
weather
porter
quaffing
definitely
worth
seeking
out
old
growler
appealed
to
me
with
its
label
featuring
an
english
bulldog
on
the
front
the
beer
is
a
nice
brown
color
with
decent
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
and
malty
taste
is
roasted
malty
chocolate
and
sweet
with
a
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
good
medium
to
light
body
with
pleasing
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
at
5
50
abv
with
malty
slightly
roasted
taste
thats
clean
and
goes
well
with
food
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
is
a
little
sweeter
than
what
you
traditionally
get
with
a
porter
and
i
would
put
this
a
little
closer
to
a
brown
ale
it
is
a
tasty
balance
of
british
malts
and
hops
with
a
bit
of
roast
thrown
in
for
good
measure
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
doubt
that
i
will
seek
it
out
poured
from
the
bottle
a
nice
brown
body
with
hints
of
rubyred
showing
through
unfortunately
the
head
quickly
settled
down
and
the
brew
quickly
became
a
rather
flatlooking
pint
smell
of
chocolate
malt
and
a
bit
of
fusel
alcohols
taste
up
front
is
smooth
caramel
and
chocolaty
then
a
fusel
bite
not
many
hops
evident
really
good
smooth
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
all
in
all
a
tasty
brew
and
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
an
english
porter
its
really
rich
though
and
many
breweries
would
try
to
call
this
a
stout
overall
impression
a
lighter
porter
easy
to
drink
nice
unsweetened
chocolate
and
hop
balance
easy
on
the
eyes
hard
to
find
anything
wrong
with
this
one
im
not
a
porter
fan
and
i
liked
this
but
again
its
a
lighter
porter
so
a
porter
for
nonporter
lovers
overall
this
is
an
average
porter
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
bottle
featuring
a
label
of
an
english
bulldog
aroma
is
all
chocolate
taste
is
chocolate
some
coffee
notes
a
little
bit
of
raison
reminds
me
of
chocolate
covered
raisons
i
like
it
definitely
worth
a
try
only
a
faint
head
of
foam
color
is
dark
brownamber
as
you
can
barely
see
through
it
smell
is
a
bit
faint
with
notes
of
licorice
and
coffee
taste
is
dry
coffee
flavored
malt
hops
low
finish
is
somewhat
bitter
and
carries
a
strong
of
strong
fresh
coffee
grounds
medium
body
well
carbonated
drinkablity
is
nice
a
little
more
robustcomplex
flavor
might
make
this
a
great
session
porter
but
for
now
its
just
decent
drinkability
a
wonderful
example
of
a
subtle
but
complex
porter
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
roasted
malts
its
light
with
some
burnt
toffee
notes
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
seems
a
bit
light
but
goes
down
easy
with
some
residual
sweetness
on
the
finish
it
has
a
funny
aftertaste
like
molasses
or
wet
cardboard
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
nothing
id
buy
again
i
dont
really
care
for
the
taste
drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
flavorable
english
porter
want
to
thank
my
friend
for
picking
me
up
some
beers
note
this
beer
is
erroneously
listed
as
an
american
porter
it
is
anything
but
cellared
for
one
year
pours
a
cloudy
dark
mahogany
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
foam
soap
bubble
head
drops
quickly
but
leaves

toasted
caramel
flavor
with
some
black
patent
and
chocolate
that
give
depth
to
the
flavor
but
the

is
still

distinctly
bavarinan
hop
aftertaste
sligthly
dry

creates
a

the

carbonation
are
light
lending
a

mouthfeel
but
much
lighter
than
a
typical
porter
a
strong
bourbon
aroma
overpowers
anything
else
perhaps
this
was
aged
in
whiskey
barrels
this
may
also
contribute
to
the
solventlike
finish
that
is
more
astringent
than
acidic
or
vinous

for
me

and
on
the
light
side
a
nice

cap
not
uber
drinkable
due
to
the
sweetness
but
i
wouldnt

eight
of
this

one
or
two
would
do
me
just
fine
lightmedium
bodied
smooth
textured
and
easy
to
drink
a
different
but
respectable
english
porter
the
body
is
light
and
almost
thin
yet
retains
a
creamy
smooth
texture
definately
a
middle
of
the
road
porter
light
enough
for
drinking
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
nearly
opaque
amber
with
a
smallish
rocky
tan
head
aromas
of
raisins
burnt
coffee
and
a
hint
of
plum
tastes
more
like
burnt
coffee
than
anything
else
dry
finish
a
lot
thinner
on
the
body
than
i
would
have
expected
as
i
like
my
porters
thick
and
chewy
however
the
one
positive
aspect
of
this
characteristic
is
that
it
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
for
its
style
a
very
middleoftheroad
porter
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
pretty
close
to
black
coffee
topped
by
a
quickly
dissipating
anemic
looking
white
head
aroma
is
more
complex
than
i
would
have
expected
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
with
some
fruit
and
a
little
nuttiness
quite
a
bit
of
caramel
in
there
too
some
alcohol
presence
in
the
nose
as
well
the
first
thing
i
notice
as
i
sip
is
the
thin
mouthfeel
taste
is
actually
decent
despite
the
almost
watery
mouthfeel
bitter
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
some
coffee
dominate
some
nutty
qualites
are
apparent
and
a
hint
of
fruit
english
hops
are
present
in
a
subdued
state
finish
is
dry
and
coffee
like
along
with
slight
tannin
astringency
not
a
bad
porter
but
not
outstanding
in
any
way
overall
i
would
describe
it
as
thin
for
some
reason
i
have
an
image
of
english
soldiers
drinking
this
and
cursing
about
it
other
comments
sort
of
a
weird
one
the
banananess
seems
out
of
place
but
i
suppose
it
makes
it
interesting
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
ive
had
better
porters
but
this
is
still
pretty
good
definately
worth
a
try
at
least
comments
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
and
definitely
worth
a
try
it
has
a
few
characteristics
that
remind
me
of
lager
beer
which
is
pretty
strange
pours
with
a
twofinger

that
fades

there
is
a
strong

in
the
aroma
a
big
rush
of
coffee
flavor
followed
by
some
chocolate

and
back
to
a
black

bitterness
for
the
finish
quite
tasty
pours
to
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
of
roasted

and
toasted
malts
it
has
a
nice
dark
chocolate
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
toasty
and
bready
which
then
flows
to
a
light
roastiness

it
has
a

in

is
a
bit
of

roast

very
nice
drinking

drinkability
this
one
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
bit
and
as
more
of
it
passes
over
my
palate
i
cant
say
i
love
this
beer
but
with
its
intriguing
flavor
i
might
consider
drinking
it
again

a
bit
surprising
with
quite
strong

notes
with
nice
roasted

with
subtle

and
a
thin

body
was
lighter
then
expected
for
a
porter
overall
this
is
like
a
light
chocolate
porter

not
bad
just
different
i
guess
the
label
informs
the
drinker
that
this
is
a
traditional
english
porter
and
that
the
recipe
is
254
years
old
thats
traditional
by
anyones
definition
be
that
as
it
may
old
growler
isnt
really
my
thing
simple
to
drink
sure
stands
out
in
any
way
nope
im
sure
that
there
are
adherents
to
this
type
of
porter
in
general
and
this
beer
in
particular
but
ill
give
it
a
friendly
respectful
pass
seemed
a
cross
between
a
barleywine
and
a
porter
in
aroma
and
taste
easier
drink
than
a
thick
stout
tan
brown
with
a
modest
amount
of
lace
and
not
overpowering
as
a
barleywine
nice
mediumbit
thin
mouthfeel
malty
modest
roasty
this
works
for
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
brew
is
fairly
hoppy
for
a
porter
edgy
citrus
and
a
slightly
sour
tartness
mix
with
a
light
tealike
bitterness
a
mild
piney
taste
is
noticed
in
the
finish
a
hint
of
alcohol
is
present
throughout
i
found
the
tastiest
part
of
this
beer
was
the
aftertaste
which
reminded
me
of
coffee
candy
a
very
nice
porter
that
i
will
definitely
enjoy
again

easydrinking
manner
its
an
uncommon
porter
but
drinkable
has
a
pleasing
smell
and
is
worth
a
try
once
it
has
an
ink
black
appearance
with
a
big

sticks
around

it
reminded

of

taste
is
pretty
complex
and
has
deep
dark
richness
starting
with
a
sweet
bakers
chocolate
progressing
to
a
bitter
chocolate
finish
i
am
sure
it
is
an
aquired
taste
to
which
i
have
not
been
elavated
to
which
added
a
nice
shot
of
complexity
to
an
already
intriguing
beer
my
only
complaints
were
with
the
eversoslight
thinness
in
the
body
which
cant
really
be
helped
in
a
standardgravity
brew
and
the
suggestion
of
sourness
at
the
end
of
a
swallow
really
molasses
nuts
color
slightly
coating
impressive
bittering
in
the
brew
overall
very
drinkable
well
balanced
porter
with
an
awesome
finish
the
taste
has
a
mild
sweetness
at
first
followed
by
a
low
bitterness
this
does
not
have
the
coffee
esters
one
comes
to
expect
from
todays
porters
but
i
bet
this
is
the
way
the
english
brewed
it
way
back
when
shipyard
surprised
me
with
this
one
kind
of
reminded
me
of
fullers
london
porter
o
if
you
dont
mind
english
ringwood
yeast
then
this
brew
is
a
great
addition
to
winter
kind
of
a
hybrid
of
scotch
ale
and
english
porter
worthy
of
a
try
if
you
like
english
brews
o
a
easy
drinking
porter
claiming
to
be
a
winter
warmer
the
low
abv
makes
putting
the
whole
bomber
away
too
easy
and
youll
be
feeling
quite
cozy
i
might
go
back
to
this
if
i
need
a
smooth
easy
to
put
down
session
porter
o
outstanding
and
unusually
low
abv
winter
warmer
overall
complex
flavorful
and
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
shipyard
which
doesnt
say
a
whole
lot
but
this
is
certainly
a
good
one
o
the
carbonation
is
almost
like
in
an
adjunct
lager
rich
and
aggresive
otherwise
its
a
little
to
modest
for
my
taste
pours
black
little
to
no
head
into
an
imperial
dimple
mug
i
expected
winter
warmer
when
i
read
the
label
it
kind
is
a
cross
between
a
winter
warmer
a
lighter
porter
and
kind
of
stoutish
roasty
but
not
too
roasty
heavy
but
not
too
heavy
kinda
sweet
and
juicy
but
not
too
much
a
very
solid
drinker
great
mouthfeel
and
perfect
carbonation
one
of
shipyards
best
offerings
too
bad
they
dont
distribute
more
could
be
a
huge
6
pack
seller
for
them
i
picked
it
up
at
the
federal
jacks
store
first
place
ive
seen
it
well
balanced
well
done
a
solid
brew
overall
not
great
but
not
bad
either
and
just
unique
enough
that
its
worth
giving
a
shot
o
overall
a
nice
porter
that
is
dominated
by
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
as
well
as
roasted
malts
the
nose
had
a
little
bit
more
going
for
it
and
was
more
complex
than
the
taste
and
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
would
have
it
again
enjoyed
this
cask
ale
at
the
sea
dog
brewpub
in
south
portland
maine
it
was
a
very
dark
brown
black
color
with
a
goodly
tan
big
bubbled
head
and
modest
signs
of
lace
the
aroma
says
flowery
fruit
nougat
and
juniper
malt
and
brown
bread
very
interesting
the
flavor
brings
a
bit
of
what
the
nose
detected
but
with
more
of
the
sweet
coffee
and
light
charcoal
bitterness
the
body
is
near
medium
with
a
pretty
low
carbonation
aqueous
feel
its
got
plenty
of
character
a
little
grassy
hop
edge
medium
drinkability
and
a
very
nice
cask
offering
lots
of
notes
of
chocolate
almost
completely
dominated
by
it
to
be
honest
once
you
moved
past
that
there
were
some
nice
hints
of
sugary
caramel
and
a
touch
of
roasted
coffee
coming
through
in
the
smell
now
some
nice
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
smoke
maybe
and
definitely
a
hint
of
vanilla
full
on
chocolate
malt
assault
as
the
first
wave
of
flavor
came
over
my
tongue
big
notes
here
of
dark
chocolate
mixed
in
with
a
touch
of
coffee
as
well
very
dark
and
complex
hints
of
vanilla
caramel
and
lactose
its
nice
to
know
that
here
in
new
england
one
can
still
find
mediocre
regional
beer
in
large
bottles
for
prices
low
enough
so
that
when
half
of
the
bottle
has
been
consumed
the
remaining
half
can
be
dumped
into
the
sink
without
guilty
whyamiwastingmymoney
feelings
take
longfellow
for
example
its
thin
fizzy
body
and
citrusy
tang
veer
more
toward
mild
ipa
territory
than
porter
its
lack
of
density
and
depth
qualify
it
as
a
summer
beer
not
winter
in
my
book
i
searched
hard
for
some
kind
of
aroma
even
after
letting
it
get
quite
warm
but
couldnt
find
anything
beyond
wet
ropes
is
that
the
shipyard
in
shipyard
and
coke
and
the
burnedlemon
burlappy
aftertaste
is
well
i
dont
know
what
it
is
aside
from
icky
but
it
doesnt
help
things
call
it
an
illconceived
black
apaipa
or
an
overcooked
weak
amber
but
dont
call
it
a
porter
to
the
kitchen
sink
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
at
a
time
or
just
one
for
a
long
time
its
really
one
of
the
better
cold
weather
beers
ive
had
and
its
hybrid
nature
makes
it
really
stand
out
i
wanted
this
to
be
more
more
intensity
better
distinction
in
flavor
better
body
just
misses
in
these
areas
better
as
it
warms
a
bit
and
for
shipyard
one
of
their
better
ones
this
is
not
something
ill
chase
but
wont
refuse
it
either
d
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
which
i
think
may
be
an
issue
if
im
drinking
a
beer
like
this
i
want
it
to
take
me
a
while
and
spend
some
time
letting
it
mature
unfortunately
this
beer
is
not
like
that
i
kinda
just
wanna
finish
it
off
kind
of
an
average
beer
d
if
you
havent
figured
it
out
by
now
i
think
this
beer
is
too
light
all
the
components
are
there
for
a
great
porter
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
brewer
didnt
go
all
in
with
this
one
f
syrupy
sweet
still
sticky
lots
more
sweet
malt
extract
and
low
grade
syrup
a
bad
unpleasant
bitterness
comes
through
as
well
the
bitter
on
teh
initial
taste
wasnt
so
bad
but
now
it
just
gets
bad
a
little
smoke
as
well
comes
out
d
i
wouldnt
mind
another
not
a
hugely
true
example
of
the
style
but
a
good
tasting
beer
nonetheless
picked
up
a
bomber
at
whole
foods
which
really
should
be
called
wholeycowisthisexpensivefoods
but
thats
off
topic
and
the
beer
is
halfway
reasonable
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
the
first
smell
of
this
brew
is
distinctively
english
as
it
smells
like
the
taps
at
your
local
pub
warming
a
tad
bit
one
detects
spices
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
arid
yet
sweet
hops
the
brew
pours
to
a
very
dark
root
beer
brown
which
when
held
up
the
the
light
lets
it
through
but
just
barely
the
head
generated
by
the
pour
is
tremendous
and
looks
like
a
bowl
of
porridge
upon
tasting
this
brew
is
a
cornucopia
of
flavors
it
has
hints
of
toffee
a
tad
bit
of
cinnamon
a
good
brown
sugar
malt
base
and
a
kick
of
molasses
hopping
is
evident
throughout
giving
a
nice
bitterness
behind
the
various
sweet
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
good
body
and
carbonation
to
zest
up
but
not
overdo
the
flavor
of
the
brew
this
is
good
brew
for
a
chilly
night
to
be
dranken
just
below
room
temperature
some
good
winter
spices
of
nutmeg
coriander
and
anise
with
a
porterlike
feel
and
consistency
the
maltiness
is
strong
feels
like
drinking
a
beer
of
a
much
higher
abv
and
much
thicker
than
a
typical
winter
ale
a
bit
smokey
on
the
back
end
but
a
wonderful
full
body
and
great
balance
on
the
finish

i
liked
this

but
didnt
love
it
i
found
the
nose
to
be
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
flavor
profile
however
worth
a
try
d
quite
drinkable
with
a
good
combination
of
malt
and
spice
complexity
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
shipyard
though
it
doesnt
take
all
that
much
to
beat
their
usual
fare
poured

forever
dry

a
dry

that
goes

to
a

that
has
a
good
amount
of
roasted

in
it
caramel
and
dark

also
make
an

as
do
some
the

thanks
to
a
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
backbite
abv
slightly
noticeable
especially
when
you
let

its
only
average
this
beer
looked
very
promising
smellt
the
same
but
the
flavour
and
mouthfeel
was
very
disappointing
to
me
but
it
could
be
worse
it
is
still
worth
having
a
go
at
ahh
i
definitely
liked
this
one
a
bunch
a
good
winter
ale
without
the
hypedup
spices
found
in
abundance
with
some
a
nice
dark
brown
near
black
pour
with
rubyred
edges
of
light
and
a
good
burnt
beige
2
finger
head
that
settled
to
1
nice
clinging
stick
lace
and
an
aroma
of
lemonmalt
with
nuts
chocolate
the
flavor
is
a
rich
malt
with
hints
of
said
dark
chocolate
and
lemon
leaving
a
mild
smoke
in
the
tip
of
the
nose
at
the
end
crisp
and
slightly
bitter
with
smooth
malt
flavor
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
porterstyle
ale
drinkability
great
porter
however
keep
in
mind
that
this
was
bottled
and
in
a
box
traveling
across
the
us
to
albuquerque
nm
via
ups
the
bottles
best
by
date
is
not
marked
either
i
am
not
familiar
with
how
amazing
clubs
works
in
terms
of
logistics
it
could
have
been
sitting
on
a
shelf
with
them
for
an
extended
period
of
time
i
imagine
that
finding
this
on
tap
or
freshly
bottled
in
maine
would
make
this
beer
a
5
0
d
the
best
shipyard
brew
i
have
ever
tasted
solid
brew
tasty
and
pretty
damn
drinkable
overall
nice
beer
i
like
it
and
ill
probably
buy
it
next
winter
too
if
possible
this
is
a
nice
smooth
porter
that
i
highly
recommend
the
taste
is
somewhat
indicative
of
the
nose
on
the
beer
in
addition
to
the
chocolate
toffee
caramel
malts
there
is
a
slight
smokiness
to
the
beer
once
it
settles
a
bit
there
is
definitely
some
scotch
type
ale
in
this
beer
but
it
has
to
settle
way
down
before
some
of
the
finer
background
qualities
emerge
there
is
a
buttery
taste
to
the
beer
but
on
the
whole
the
hop
character
adds
a
nice
bite
and
sharpness
to
the
beer
that
takes
away
any
creaminess
that
may
have
been
present
as
the
beer
settles
the
sharpness
segues
slightly
into
the
more
smokey
scotch
ale
character
the
beer
is
decently
carbonated
not
flat
or
syrupy
with
a
slightly
charred
malt
and
dark
chocolate
aftertaste
comments
i
hadnt
had
this
brew
in
years
but
now
remember
why
i
used
to
like
it
so
much
shipyards
offerings
have
not
been
my
first
choice
over
the
years
but
this
is
one
ill
seek
out
again
solid
drinkable
brew
served
from
a
22
oz
bottle
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
brown
color
ale
with
a
good
size
foamy
head
with
some
good
retention
and
some
minimal
lacing
aroma
consists
of
strong
caramel
malt
with
some
notes
of
toffee
also
discernable
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
roasted
malt
with
distinctive
notes
of
caramel
malt
with
some
toffee
notes
also
discernable
full
body
with
good
carbonation
and
no
discernable
alcohol
i
know
winter
ale
is
not
a
style
per
say
but
this
is
what
i
consider
a
winter
ale
but
still
very
enjoyable
during
hot
summer
days
looks
like
a
beautiful
porter
to
me
poured
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
over
the
very
clear
yet
very
dark
brew
the
red
highlights
and
now
lacey
head
have
a
nice
fruity
roasted
character
and
while
the
chocolate
malts
are
there
in
the
taste
there
are
a
lot
of
other
flavors
at
work
as
well
the
hops
are
mild
and
in
the
background
the
lower
carbonation
in
this
beer
kind
of
lets
the
malts
take
it
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
still
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
and
id
say
its
a
nice
drinkable
porter
thanks
for
the
beer
there
weswes
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
roasted
and
crystal
mlats
along
with
a
fruity
ringwood
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
sweet
caramel
malt
feel
in
the
beginning
followed
by
a
dry
roasted
malt
finish
the
yeast
gives
it
a
slightly
fruity
character
and
although
the
finish
is
dry
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
porter
its
got
good
malt
character
and
a
smooth
quaffability
given
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
appears
as
though
i
got
a
less
than
representative
bottle
i
will
make
every
effort
to
acquire
another
and
will
glady
put
mr
longfellow
through
his
paces
again
cant
say
id
pick
this
one
up
too
often
but
thats
why
its
a
seasonal
im
sure
next
winter
the
craving
will
set
in
once
in
the
pint
glass
the
beer
presented
itself
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
12
head
lacing
was
left
as
the
head
receded
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
slightly
of
coffee
tastes
of
sweet
malt
a
little
coffee
and
maybe
some
dark
fruit
flavors
some
hop
presence
in
the
background
finishes
dry
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
smooth
with
crisp
carbonation
easy
to
drink
very
tastey
brew
i
read
that
this
is
beer
is
sort
of
a
cross
between
a
porter
and
a
scottish
ale
so
i
was
definitely
intrigued
as
to
what
it
would
taste
like
after
a
couple
sips
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
reminds
me
most
of
an
english
winter
warmer
it
definitely
has
the
strong
malt
character
of
a
scottish
ale
and
the
roasted
malt
flavor
of
a
porter
its
got
a
rather
complex
taste
actually
kind
of
like
one
taste
melding
into
another
with
a
bitter
finish
i
am
pretty
impressed
by
this
one
ive
never
had
it
before
and
didnt
know
shipyard
even
brewed
a
beer
of
this
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
a
good
drinking
beer
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
as
well
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
thick
for
me
to
drink
too
many
but
an
interesting
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
this
is
a
really
great
winter
sipper
split
a
couple
of
bombers
between
friends
on
a
snowy
night
and
youll
have
pure
enjoyment
at
hand
very
good
taste
is
rich
of
coffee
and
malt
not
terribly
sweet
though
has
a
dry
taste
and
follows
up
with
a
bitterness
bit
buttery
in
the
mouth
but
a
good
amount
from
a
22oz
to
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
slight
head
the
head
quickly
disappeared
and
left
a
ring
that
lasted
the
whole
glass
aroma
was
strong
had
hints
of
chocolate
cake
with
plenty
of
spicing
tasted
the
same
plenty
of
spicing
appropriate
for
a
winter
ale
went
down
very
easy
and
felt
good
in
the
mouth
slight
carbonation
but
nothing
enough
to
detract
from
the
beer
a
great
winter
warmer
look
forward
to
having
again
solid
probably
one
of
the
best
brews
shipyard
has
to
offer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
poured
a
pitch
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
about
12
an
inch
thick
head
slowly
faded
but
did
not
stick
around
for
the
entire
glass
rich
molasses
smell
with
slight
dark
fruit
and
coffee
taste
is
nice
and
dry
upfront
developing
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
middle
then
a
sharp
sweet
alcoholic
bite
and
dry
finish
that
disapates
off
the
palate
light
to
medium
carbonation
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
very
nice
drinkability
very
nice
version
of
the
style
having
a
bit
richer
flavor
than
most
others
i
have
tried
the
bottle
throws
you
off
it
has
an
old
dude
on
it
that
looks
like
hed
drink
budweiser
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
came
out
a
brown
liquid
with
a
small
foamy
tanbrown
head
not
a
spectacular
looking
beer
but
smells
of
some
toffee
butterscotch
tastes
not
like
a
typical
porter
but
it
has
the
coffee
tones
to
it
and
is
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
has
some
bitter
hints
and
seems
thinner
than
the
average
porter
as
well
goes
down
ok
and
doesnt
disappoint
shipyard
seems
to
be
putting
out
some
good
products
the
carbonation
is
medium
strong
small
bubbles
the
liquid
is
smooth
it
poured
with
a
dark
brown
almost
tarlike
color
and
with
two
fingers
of
thick
good
foam
it
was
looking
very
inviting
the
smell
was
of
toffee
roasted
malts
and
strong
coffee
notes
the
taste
was
bittersweet
with
lots
of
coffee
and
some
chocolate
too
inside
is
a
fruitiness
of
maybe
oranges
at
least
some
citrus

is

brew
as
the

reflect

the

ale
good
stuff
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
this
was

had
a
malty
aroma
with
a

of
dark
fruit
decent
taste
coffee
fruit
a
little

i
thought
the
beer
was
a
little
thin
but
still
was
quite
enjoyable
it
pours
a
dark
cola
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
that
dispels
slowly
the
visible
carbonation
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
continues
to
remind
me
of
a
cola
the
smell
of
the
last
one
i
had
that
i
am
using
to
review
is
fainter
than
the
other
two
i
had
but
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
smell
which
continues
with
the
taste
tastes
and
smells
like
a
porter
and
is
quite
smooth
i
also
enjoyed
the
aftertaste
which
i
find
difficult
to
describe
i
would
consider
the
drinkability
quite
good
and
would
have
another
longfellow

a
bit

with
chocolate
notes
and

until
it
warms
there
is
a
subtle
complimentary
hop
bite
this
eventually
peters
out
but
is
nice
while
it
lasts
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
thin
to
medium
body
tasty
but
lacks
depth
and
body
pretty
accurate
to
style
mellow
definitely
sessionable
but
this
could
use
some
more
oomph
this
pours
a
very
dark

taste
is
very
good
with
a
strong

coffee
and
especially
malt
roastyness
and
sweetness
the
mf
is
medium
with
aftertaste
that
is
just
abit
too
watery
and
weak
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
and
if
the
aroma
was
stronger
this
could
be
a
rated
much
higher

quite
black

i
can
smell
hops
and
malt
at
first
i
taste
the
malt
which
fades
into
hops
i
think
there
is
a
nice
balance
here
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
this
is
pretty
decent
not
my
favorite
winter
ale
but
quite
tasty
worth
a
try
tangy
and
pungent
mouthfeel
i
will
pass
this
by
in
the
future
pours
a
lovely

decent

smells
include
roasted
malts
coffee
and
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
taste
is
a
bit
underwhelming
with
the
roasted
malts
making
up
the
main
body
of
the
flavor
with
hints
of
fruits
plum
and
apple
showing
up
in
the
end
this
is
a

its
moments

despite
my
review
thanks
to
pisskynights
for
this
brew
that
comes
from
a
generous
sampling
of
brews
which
i
know
will
be
far
better
than
this
a
very
pleasant
ale
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
shipyard
worth
a
try
this
ale
would
really
kick
some
ass
if
it
were
aged
in
some
old
whisky
barrels
if
anyone
at
shipyard
is
listening
a
solid
offering
on
its
own
anyways
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
so
great
in
fact
i
could
drink
it
any
time
of
year
taste
heavy
buttery
overtones
but
certainly
not
overwhelming
this
beer
is
flat
out
average
when
cold
but
is
absolutely
incredible
as
it
warms
thick
sticky
chewy
and
delicious
dark
dried
fruits
aged
in
a
root
cellar
with
just
enough
hop
presence
to
balance
things
out
well
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
and
an
absolute
musttry
if
in
new
england
in
the
wintertime
prost
this
is
a
tasty
brew
for
a
cold
snowy
nite
like
tonite
the
body
is
considerably
thinner
than
i
remember
with
a
much
more
subdued
flavor
the
first
time
i
tried
this
a
few
years
back
i
couldnt
finish
drinking
it
too
strong
for
my
weak
palate
not
bad
but
i
passed
on
another
pint
very
dark
looks
pretty
much
black
the
head
was
light
but
not
white
and
fizzy
soon
faded
to
nothing
but
the
circle
of
bubbles
caused
by
the
scoring
at
the
bottom
of
my
petrus
triple
snifter
the
nose
is
heavy
on
the
apple
peels
caramel
apples
and
assorted
fruits
are
dominate
in
the
flavor
but
theres
a
lurking
char
flavor
that
stirs
things
up
a
bit
a
really
interesting
beer
and
i
cant
really
say
ive
had
anything
like
it
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brown
hue
with
a
tan
head
smells
kind
of
like
a
bells
kalamazoo
stout
this
is
an
interesting
holiday
brew
it
is
darksmokey
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
a
little
bit
of
chocolatey
stout
kinda
flavor
yet
kind
of
a
medium
mouthfeel
not
to
overwhelming
a
standout
beer
in
the
shipyard
gift
pack
i
couldnt
wait
to
dig
in
to
this
beer
i
took
a
drink
and
it
felt
like
heaven
in
my
mouth
however
i
swallowed
and
the
taste
left
something
to
be
desired
the
overall
flavor
just
seemed
muted
nothing
jumped
out
at
all
not
even
to
say
hi
i
enjoyed
the
cask
quality
of
this
beer
but
i
think
it
had
the
potential
to
be
so
much
better
especially
since
ive
had
it
out
of
the
bottle
cheers
to
another
fine
maine
brew
and
to
rabidawg
for
sending
it
my
way
appearance
is
a
deep
brown
with
tinges
of
red
has
a
thick
nutty
head
that
dissipates
relatively
quickly
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
malt
a
bit
of
chocolate
is
present
in
both
smell
and
taste
with
a
bit
more
hop
kick
this
beer
would
taste
like
a
porter
im
liking
this
beer
a
lot
and
have
found
myself
going
back
to
it
again
and
again
longfellow
came
in
a
22oz
bomber
with
a
picture
of
the
grisly
old
poet
on
the
front
very
dark
in
color
almost
black
but
with
brownish
edges
the
head
was
a
medium
size
with
medium
retention
the
aroma
consisted
of
sweet
roasty
malts
with
a
fruity
quality
to
it
like
apples
or
pears
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
the
taste
was
built
on
a
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
base
nice
and
creamy
and
then
finished
with
just
a
tiny
hop
bite
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
coating
the
palate
nicely
and
providing
a
smooth
and
rich
feel
my
favorite
so
far
from
shipyard
although
the
prelude
awaits
me
in
the
fridge
so
this
may
change
by
far
my
favorite
beer
from
shipyardpours
a
deep
ruby
with
a
light
but
sticky
headaroma
is
nice
malty
sweet
and
chocolaty
taste
is
right
up
my
alley
with
a
nice
malty
flavor
with
some
sweetness
with
some
roated
flavors
its
a
real
warmer
liked
it
much
better
on
cask
than
in
the
bottle
would
like
to
have
again
on
cask
black

the

massive

slightly

nose
of
modest
strength
decent
palate
dry
chocolate
chalky
the
malt
seems
thin
and
not
very
sweet
either
the
alcohol
influence
is
minimal
the
flavors
all
seem
a
little
empty
the
body
is
mediumlight
the
carbonation
is
moderate
the
finish
is
dull
and
empty
as
the
beer
warmed
nothing
improved
aside
from
a
few
stray
notes
of
fruitiness
on
the
palate
this
did
not
taste
like
a
strong
alebarely
wine
at
all
it
seemed
very
much
like
a
dry
stout
i
guess
my
tastebuds
did
not
concur
with
my
fellow
bas
on
this
one
either
way
a
big
thank
you
is
in
order
for
steview
for
the
bomber
it
was
a
solid
brew
beautiful
dark
tootsie
roll
brown
with
an
impressive
head
that
slightly
laces
smell
is
classic
strong
ale
earthy
and
sweet
with
subtle
alcohol
mixed
in
looks
like
a
porter
and
tastes
almost
like
one
with
its
smoked
malt
chocolate
notes
with
tettnang
and
goldings
providing
some
bitterness
great
smooth
full
bodied
ale
and
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
shipyard
drinkability
is
excellent
but
dont
gulp
pours
a
hazy
brown
body
with
a
light
reddish
cast
and
deep
mahogany
highlights
its
twofingered
frothy
lighttan
head
slowly
drops
to
a
quarterinch
of
creamy
surface
covering
amongst
some
very
nice
lace
a
pleasing
nose
expresses
caramel
toffee
mild
butterscotch
and
a
berrylikeapple
fruitiness
the
body
is
firm
with
a
fine
moderate
carbonation
that
gently
caresses
the
tongue
before
becoming
creamy
and
smooth
across
the
palate
in
the
mouth
rich
notes
of
caramelized
sugar
and
butterscotch
are
tempered
by
a
mild
chocolate
character
and
roasty
edge
some
almosttropical
fruitiness
appears
at
the
outset
and
then
again
midway
through
the
mouth
after
the
sweetness
and
buttery
notes
have
passed
but
gives
way
to
a
drying
roasty
cusp
and
bold
but
balanced
bitterness
some
alcohol
is
clearly
present
but
it
works
well
within
the
blanket
of
malt
and
seems
more
warmingcomforting
than
intrusive
it
finishes
dry
with
some
mild
lingering
caramel
and
bitterness
this
is
an
exceptionally
wellrounded
winter
beer
that
seems
to
straddle
several
styles
and
i
love
it
for
its
individuality
and
uniqueness
it
has
the
unobtrusive
bitterness
and
buttery
diacetyl
note
of
a
brown
ale
the
fuller
chocolateycaramel
note
of
a
porter
and
the
rich
maltiness
of
a
scotch
ale
its
not
so
strong
or
full
however
that
it
needs
to
be
set
aside
as
an
afterdinner
drink
and
its
surely
a
winter
gem
that
could
grace
any
festive
table
well
worth
trying
could
be
the
next
beer
it
forward
sample
stay
tuned
was
in
portsmouth
this
weekend
and
stopped
by
coat
of
arms
this
was
one
of
the
cask
ales
on
tap
and
it
was
very
good
poured
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
that
lasted
the
taste
was
sweet
all
the
way
with
hints
of
coffee
toffee
caramel
and
malt
the
smell
was
similar
to
the
taste
but
more
sweet
than
malty
the
aftertaste
was
more
coffee
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
great
warming
feeling
you
have
to
love
the
cask
offerings
at
the
coat
of
arms
this
was
a
great
caskconditioned
ale
it
went
down
smooth
and
easy
two
were
gone
before
i
realized
it
all
the
flavor
of
a
winter
ale
without
filling
you
up
i
only
wish
that
it
had
a
little
more
aroma
and
some
pretense
of
a
head
winter
seasonals
are
my
favorite
so
seeing
this
at
the
local
watering
hole
sparked
my
interest
it
poured
nice
and
dark
with
that
chocolate
coloured
head
the
first
drink
bursted
in
my
mouth
with
the
taste
of
roasted
hops
it
seemed
more
a
stout
than
an
ale
but
i
wasnt
complaining
it
went
down
way
to
quick
excellent
this
is
another
winter
beer
that
i
dont
ever
seem
to
get
enough
of
very
drinkable
get
it
if
you
can
looks
stately
in
the
glass
clear
dark

the
beer
has

slightly
chocolately
and
butterscotch
traits
warms
up
well
becomes
deeper
richer
alcohol
warmth
kicks
in
slightly
not
an
overthetop
winter
warmer
but
certainly
enjoyable
this
tasty
cask
ale
is
a
pure
pleasure
of
the
season
deep
dark
color
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
prominently
buttery
sweet
the
flavor
is
hoppy
and
the
body
heavy
and
smooth
very
complex
and

with

very

like
a

with

qualities
quite
a
big
ale
beautiful
for
dismal
winter
days
of
snow
ice
sleet
freezing
rain
hail
slush
and
so
on
this
is
my
favorite
from

its
the
perfect
winter
beer
inky
black
smells
of
roasted
malts
hints
of
coffee
very
dry
burnt
coffee
grounds
thin
mouthfeel
a
very
good
offering
from
a
very
small
brewery
in
st
paul
mn
plenty
of
character
can
be
found
in
this
distinct
english
porter
worth
picking
up
pours
a
dark
brown
body
which
borders
on
black
two
fingers
of
mocha
foam
which
sticks
around
for
a
while
moderate
level
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roast
light
chocolate
and
some
faint
oxidation
in
the
form
of
dark
fruits
taste
is
roasted
malts
into
some
vinous
red
wine
and
dark
fruits
appears
to
be
a
tad
over
the
hill
and
off
but
it
still
remains
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
the
beer
has
a
certain
mineral
quality
which
detracts
quite
a
bit
overall
this
is
clearly
a
beer
that
gets
ruined
with
age
this
must
have
at
least
a
year
or
so
on
it
and
oxidation
is
seeping
in
and
messing
with
the
delicate
porter
notes
drink
fresh
not
really
impressed
by
this
beer
at
all
not
sure
how
old
it
is
but
the
sourness
is
not
a
good
sign
i
have
a
feeling
this
will
end
up
being
a
drain
pour
low
c
overall
i
didnt
get
much
from
the
rye
i
cant
say
i
was
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
want
another
o
a
fairly
good
porter
it
leans
a
little
too
far
sweet
and
not
quite
roasted
enough
that
said
still
tasty
with
a
little
less
alcohol
and
a
little
more
flavor
this
would
be
quite
sessionable
though
it
is
a
bit
too
middleoftheroad
otherwise
o
meh
not
my
favorite
too
bad
since
its
local
and
they
have
been
around
since
surly
very
light
brown
head
lingers
nicely
before
falling
to
a
thin
lace
at
first
i
thought
the
nose
was
coffee
but
on
second
thought
its
more
clearly
a
clean
roast
with
an
earth
spice
coming
out
with
the
warmth
strong
malt
with
a
roasty
smokiness
in
the
taste
thats
supported
by
a
light
but
not
thin
body
ends
with
a
bitterness
that
lingers
lightly
a
very
solid
porter
that
pushes
the
style
towards
robust

cygnus
is
made
with
rye
malt
which
explains
the
bite
that
i
noticed
but
couldnt
place
after
ive
had
the
straight
cygnus
x1
now
the
differences
overlaid
in
the
smores
infused
grand
design
i
took
home
at
christmas
are
clear
cygnus
is
a
slightly
off
centered
porter
thats
fun
and
interesting
to
drink
o
ive
only
had
this
for
a
week
or
so
but
have
no
idea
how
old
it
is
anyway
this
was
undrinkable
bummer
as
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
d
oh
yes
again
and
again
o
a
solid
offering
but
lacking
a
little
flavor
depth
big
thanks
goes
out
to
mbrausen
for
sending
me
this
one
so
i
could
tick
it
shared
this
one
with
the
noda
brewing
crew
in
celebration
of
their
grand
opening
weekend
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
minimal
light
tan
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
a
subtle
spiciness
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
coffee
dark
chocolate
subtle
sweet
malt
and
a
subtle
pepper
spiciness
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
was
quite
surprised
by
the
pepper
spiciness
on
the
followthrough
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
by
the
way
the
rest
of
the
brew
was
okay
but
nothing
special
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
give
this
one
a
shot
but
doubt
i
would
seek
it
out
in
the
future
o
although
i
love
this
beer
i
dont
like
how
the
peppers
are
adding
to
this
beer
no
comparison
to
grand
design
smores
not
quite
smooth
and
caramelly
enough
to
be
an
english
porter
but
still
quite
nice
while
additional
points
of
complexity
are
light
and
quite
subtle
the
malt
profile
is
multifaceted
and
shows
great
depth
a
very
drinkable
tasty
porter
overall
a
great
porter
and
one
i
wish
was
distributed
around
here
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
good
beer
that
might
be
even
better
on
tap
a
good
choice
when
one
doesnt
want
a
huge
dose
of
alcohol
or
a
phalanx
of
hops
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
porter
i
liked
the
nose
a
lot
and
thought
there
was
a
lot
of
sweet
chocolate
would
like
to
try
again
overall
a
very
good
porter
from
flat
earth
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
tasted
o
this
is
a
great
porter
lots
of
roast
but
never
burnt
on
the
palate
just
enough
sweetness
to
keep
the
flavors
going
skål
o
not
a
huge
fan
mostly
of
the
flavor
profile
it
was
just
too
much
coffee
for
me
if
it
had
a
little
more
chocolate
or
roast
and
was
a
little
thicker
i
think
it
would
have
done
the
trick
for
me
notes
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
it
lacks
a
bit
in
body
from
what
i
expected
but
flavor
and
complexity
make
up
for
it
a
very
tasty
beer
i
must
admit
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
it
was
an
infected
bottle
which
turned
me
away
but
now
that
i
have
had
this
again
i
will
be
buying
it
more
often
and
i
will
be
stocking
it
at
the
store
in
the
near
future
very
muvch
a
standard
medium
body
porter
this
beer
clocks
in
at
6
5
abv
and
the
alochol
isnt
noticeable
i
shared
the
bomber
with
my
roommate
and
a
friend
of
his
and
id
probably
do
it
again
overall
this
is
a
solid
but
not
overwhelming
beer
id
be
lucky
to
have
it
on
tap
because
its
very
true
to
its
style
a
pretty
good
porter
lacks
depth
but
is
very
approachable
recommended
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
massive
tan
head
that
lingered
smell
is
a
bit
light
for
a
porter
more
fruit
and
caramel
malt
and
not
quite
as
much
roasted
malt
as
i
expect
taste
is
nice
moderately
complex
typical
porter
chocolate
malts
with
some
bitter
hops
following
highly
carbonated
for
a
porter
generally
good
but
not
great
thanks
to
brewnic
for
the
extra
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
dimpled
glass
the
body
is
dark
brownblack
and
atop
it
is
a
finger
sized
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
and
is
somewhat
bubbly
so
far
so
good
the
aroma
here
is
coffee
chocolate
tart
dark
fruits
lowkey
but
noticeably
skunky
hops
and
a
generalized
roast
fragrance
that
leans
toward
bread
and
cereal
grains
rather
than
specifically
malt
roasty
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
bloom
in
the
fore
and
then
segue
into
yet
sweeter
notes
of
fruit
malt
this
arrangement
is
pleasing
but
there
exists
a
metallic
background
to
the
whole
affair
that
is
distracting
from
a
flavor
standpoint
while
i
wish
that
metal
twang
would
go
away
it
was
kind
of
a
deal
killer
for
me
the
mouth
feel
is
mostly
where
it
should
be
for
the
style
full
carbonation
i
cant
say
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
and
wouldnt
want
it
again
though
i
respect
the
style
d
this
is
a
really
nice
englishstyle
porter
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
good
but
alcohol
could
drop
a
few
points
for
a
simple
beer
like
this
one
overall
i
was
excited
by
the
smell
and
then
disappointed
by
the
taste
so
overall
an
average
beer
pretty
good
drink
its
tasty
and
something
i
would
venture
for
regularly
but
not
in
the
same
night
drinkability
a
pretty
good
but
not
great
porter
ill
try
flat
earths
other
beers
d
a
decent
beer
drinks
well
but
the
roasted
malt
and
roasted
coffee
flavor
hang
on
a
bit
more
than
necessary
drinkability
good
drinkability
average
there
is
a
flavor
note
possibly
the
coffee
bitterness
becomes
a
bit
too
lingering
in
an
otherwise
decent
brew
that
isnt
hard
on
the
palate
note
this
is
my
favorite
flat
earth
offering
to
date
d
great
as
the
weather
starts
to
cool
a
great
balance
of
flavor
solid
abv
is
hidden
nicely
great
depth
and
fits
very
nicely
into
the
style
i
really
like
this
beer
and
will
certainly
purchase
again
smooth
medium
bodied
somewhat
dry
and
nicely
carbonated
this
is
very
drinkable
and
very
nice
i
must
seek
this
one
out
again
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
sort
of
light
in
color
closer
to
the
red
end
of
the
porter
spectrum
than
black
settles
somewhere
around
auburn
in
color
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
aroma
of
sees
candies
mocha
coffee
roasted
grains
nice
robust
smell
carries
over
into
the
flavor
which
is
similar
but
not
as
sweet
black
malts
meld
with
a
creamy
iced
coffee
character
a
porter
through
and
through
not
even
remotely
stoutlike
this
is
an
attribute
i
quite
like
providing
much
needed
separation
between
the
styles
very
little
roastiness
or
bitterness
finishes
dry
mouthfeel
is
full
and
almost
milky
in
consistency
really
a
sublime
porter
in
every
way
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
tannish
head
which
lasted
an
impressive
amount
of
time
a
wonderful
nose
that
revealed
fresh
bread
a
hint
of
rye
coffee
and
cream
upon
tasting
i
actually
thought
it
was
a
sort
of
sweet
stout
with
lactose
robust
and
rich
although
somewhat
thinner
body
carbonation
helps
bring
it
up
a
bit
velvety
smooth
and
definitely
quaffable
i
approve
very
drinkable
relatively
low
abv
and
everything
else
ive
noted
make
this
one
go
down
easily
im
glad
this
is
a
bomber
rather
than
a
12
oz
bottle
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
half
way
through
it
i
started
feeling
like
i
was
living
around
a
campfire
at
the
campground
smoked
and
burnt
wood
while
that
brings
present
memories
in
this
cold
time
it
isnt
necessarily
a
great
beer
taste
nice
if
not
incredible
porter
cygnus
x1
pours
a
clear
dark
cola
brown
with
a
medium
beige
head
the
aroma
consists
of
caramel
nuts
toast
bread
some
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
spicy
rye
its
a
pleasant
subtle
porter
somewhere
between
english
and
american
in
flavor
the
taste
is
a
lightly
dry
theres
also
a
funny
slightly
off
flavor
to
the
beer
that
i
also
tasted
in
flat
earths
angry
planet
its
not
as
strong
here
as
it
was
there
but
its
still
an
odd
bit
of
background
noise
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
and
carbonation
is
prickly
good
beer
but
wouldnt
look
to
get
another
bottle
easy
drinking
brew
overall
not
my
favorite
flat
earth
brew
but
its
definitely
a
good
one
drinkability
about
as
dry
as
a
porter
can
get
which
i
like
hard
to
stop
drinking
d
as
i
mentioned
in
the
taste
portion
i
think
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
somewhat
mild
and
delicate
so
i
find
myself
constantly
coming
back
for
sip
after
sip
to
keep
the
delicious
taste
on
my
tongue
great
representation
of
a
porter
and
really
reminds
me
of
why
i
began
drinking
craft
grabbed
this
one
at
a
growler
fill
night
right
at
the
brewery
its
a
great
time
to
go
in
a
get
to
try
all
of
the
beers
and
sodas
available
the
price
is
also
pretty
fair
as
low
as
9
for
a
growler
the
mouth
is
pretty
average
some
carbonation
play
and
slight
creamy
feel
this
is
a
pretty
sour
porter
the
roasted
coffee
flavors
i
was
expecting
are
absent
in
their
place
is
a
sour
mineral
flavor
that
isnt
all
that
pleasant
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
but
i
couldnt
even
finish
the
bottle
not
impressed
taste
is
really
big
in
the
coffee
come
chocolate
notes
as
well
big
malt
bomb
for
sure
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
dark
malts
linger
on
your
palate
for
quite
a
while
body
is
pretty
light
reminds
me
of
a
dry
stout
im
thinking
cadillac
mtn
stout
more
than
a
porter
poured
a
medium
brown
with
an
enormous
head
that
slowly
faded
to
a
one
fingered
one
the
aroma
while
chilled
was
vinegar
but
as
it
warmed
you
could
smell
the
chocolate
the
taste
too
was
very
sour
like
vinegar
cut
with
soda
water
the
flavor
was
helped
by
warming
but
not
a
great
deal
and
remained
somewhat
sour
feel
was
light
bodied
even
for
a
porter
with
only
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
that
survived
the
head
drinkability
was
only
fair
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
something
from
flat
earth
and
was
a
little
disappointed
i
had
thought
that
the
contents
had
spoiled
or
been
infected
but
too
many
reviewers
expressed
similar
experience
with
x1
oddly
a
large
number
reported
the
opposite
a
malty
sweetness
so
something
wasnt
quite
right
reasonably
priced
and
not
terrible
but
id
be
reluctant
to
try
again
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
poured
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
the
porter
appears
a
hazed
deep
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
ecru
foam
the
foam
settles
to
a
thin
ring
in
less
than
a
minute
leaving
no
lace
behind
nose
and
flavor
are
of
medium
roasted
cereal
grain
bittersweet
chocolate
slightly
spicy
sour
licorice
notes
some
smoke
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
as
the
beer
warms
up
so
this
is
a
very
a
good
beer
my
first
by
this
brewery
appearance
is
good
very
dark
small
head
and
some
lacing
smell
and
taset
are
very
similar
lots
of
bitter
chocolat
a
vit
of
roasted
nuts
and
some
sweet
malt
not
a
lot
of
hop
presence
but
this
is
to
be
expected
mouthfeel
is
also
good
medium
body
and
slight
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
pours
a
kind
of
flat
looking
dark
black
into
the
pint
glass
not
flat
but
not
superlively
looking
either
smells
like
sweet
not
just
malt
sweet
like
there
is
some
fruit
in
there
as
well
taste
is
a
lot
different
than
anticipated
its
actually
kind
of
sour
not
really
vinegaric
but
tart
like
a
raspberry
tart
porter
i
thought
it
might
have
been
a
bad
bottle
but
then
i
saw
others
here
experiencing
the
same
its
not
really
roasty
or
dry
more
sweet
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
coating
but
drinkability
suffered
from
the
unexpected
tartness
not
bad
by
any
means
just
different
clearly
needs
to
be
consumed
in
season
i
dont
know
if
this
was
infected
or
it
was
supposed
to
taste
like
this
but
i
definitely
didnt
like
it
very
disappointed
my
first
experience
with
flat
earth
is
a
bag
of
mixed
results
the
big
positive
is
that
it
has
a
nice
interesting
novel
flavor
due
to
the
rye
infusion
the
big
negative
is
overcarbonation
way
off
the
mark
remedying
that
problem
would
do
much
to
improve
it
nonetheless
i
like
the
flavor
and
approach
worth
checking
out
for
an
english
porter
had
some
funky
smell
and
taste
going
on
not
clean
bottle
wasnt
infected
but
it
was
just
off
some
smoke
flavoring
but
very
very
thin
for
this
type
of
beer
i
wanted
something
to
stand
out
and
say
yeah
but
that
never
happened
drain
pour
no
but
i
wont
be
purchasing
another
one
in
a
very
long
time
considering
there
are
many
more
better
porters
out
there
and
for
less
money
this
beer
tasted
cheap
like
it
was
made
at
the
old
pigs
eye
brewery
come
on
guys
you
can
do
better
if
you
are
going
to
use
a
classic
rock
bands
song
for
a
beer
please
make
a
quality
product
i
am
afraid
rush
wouldnt
be
proud
no
endorements
from
them
or
from
me
for
that
matter
d
drinkable
even
if
it
has
an
aftertaste
d
very
easy
very
smooth
a
pretty
standard
abv
so
not
really
sessionable
but
if
you
have
the
tolerance
it
wont
fill
you
up
bomber
that
i
forgot
about
probably
pushing
a
year
old
it
didnt
explode
while
in
the
cellar
so
we
are
off
to
a
good
start
pours
a
dark
ebony
with
some
garnet
highlites
when
held
up
to
the
light
minimal
head
but
fine
lacing
nose
light
roast
dark
chocolate
taste
quite
dry
surprisingly
spicy
for
style
chocolate
medium
fruitiness
nuts
carbonation
is
a
little
high
and
the
finish
is
metallic
drinkability
is
not
too
bad
clear
maple
syrup
amber
brown
body
large
creamy
lacy
dark
beige
head
good
retention
nose
is
surprisingly
full
of
sour
cherries
and
lemon
tartness
uhoh
some
scorched
caramel
and
chocolate
detectable
but
mostly
sour
and
woody
taste
is
as
expected
overwhelmingly
tart
and
sour
overcarbonated
and
gushy
with
unpleasant
woody
tartness
its
too
bad
because
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
better
luck
next
time
flat
earth
overall
gross
d
my
expectations
where
not
met
and
i
hope
this
was
a
single
bad
bottle
overall
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
i
am
kind
of
mystified
by
it
since
it
was
such
a
surprise
i
am
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
and
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
but
it
just
was
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
porter
i
dont
think
i
would
reach
for
this
one
to
warm
me
up
on
a
cold
night
like
the
bottle
suggests
but
i
will
reach
for
again
when
im
at
the
store
i
wonder
what
a
flat
earth
stout
would
be
like
dthis
a
good
one
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
flat
earth
although
not
spectacular
its
very
enjoyable
and
has
been
an
enjoyable
choice
on
several
occasions
also
nice
with
a
meal
as
i
enjoyed
the
second
half
of
the
bomber
with
dinner
i
bought
this
at
stimmels
in
oh
for
5
99
a
month
ago
never
seen
it
for
sale
again
before
or
since
the
beer
is
dark
reddish
brown
colored
clear
but
with
low
light
transmission
with
an
enourmous
poofy
foam
that
takes
forever
to
recede
the
smell
is
good
and
in
fact
is
the
strongest
attribute
in
my
opinion
loads
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
the
taste
has
a
surprising
amount
of
sourness
in
it
so
much
that
i
suspect
theres
something
wrong
with
my
bottle
maybe
the
bottle
wasnt
disinfected
properly
before
filling
the
flavor
seems
similar
to
a
homebrew
problem
i
had
once
anyway
i
can
still
get
some
chocolate
flavor
out
of
if
but
the
sourness
makes
it
difficult
to
enjoy
ill
try
this
again
if
i
see
it
in
mn
hopefully
from
a
different
batch
and
revise
the
review
in
case
i
had
a
bad
bottle
headlong
into
mystery
spinning
whirling
still
descending
like
a
spiral
sea
unending
this
beer
goes
down
nicely
and
goes
down
easily
nicely
drinkable
porter
d
i
could
tip
more
than
a
few
back
although
the
aftertaste
while
excellent
tends
to
grate
this
beer
was
super
easy
to
drink
and
at
6
5
i
could
drink
it
all
day
d
excellent
porter
i
love
the
rye
twist
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
and
next
time
ill
have
some
rush
on
the
stereo
drinkability
a
super
sessionable
porter
gets
better
as
it
goes
just
like
the
tune
thanks
to
wankerweasel
for
the
bottle
good
one
ben
cygnus
x1
is
a
terrific
english
porter
that
is
only
a
bit
more
barley
shy
of
blowing
both
my
socks
off
rather
than
just
the
one
i
will
wait
until
ive
had
the
other
two
flat
earth
beers
that
are
in
my
cellar
before
passing
final
judgment
on
this
relatively
new
brewery
so
far
though
it
looks
like
they
have
a
bright
future
thanks
feloniousmonk
hop
in
the
aftertaste
a
very
nice
porter
to
be
sure
this
one
didnt
suffer
from
bottle
bomb
but
it
did
have
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
chilled
it
for
a
couple
days
in
anticipation
of
an
overflow
but
instead
i
just
got
a
huge
head
on
the
first
pour
its
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
light
brown
head
it
smells
mostly
of
roasted
grains
and
light
chocolate
malts
but
i
get
a
slight
bit
of
hoppiness
and
smoke
on
the
tail
end
the
taste
is
really
complex
and
well
blended
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
pronounced
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
and
this
was
definitely
over
carbonated
but
it
seems
like
they
are
on
the
way
to
fixing
that
this
could
easily
be
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
tried
to
date
d
oh
this
is
an
easy
one
to
drink
d
damn
i
wasnt
expecting
this
once
i
got
beyond
the
ridiculous
carbonation
and
if
they
toned
that
down
i
would
give
this
a
higher
score
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
elements
of
a
porter
smoke
ale
as
well
as
a
milk
stout
come
through
the
end
result
is
amazing
it
is
a
curious
beer
for
sure
keep
the
beers
coming
flat
earth
magnificent
brew
here
different
but
in
a
very
good
way
no
issues
with
drinkability
not
particularly
challenging
yet
there
is
some
depth
to
this
brew
its
just
that
in
my
opinion
the
overall
experience
would
be
enhanced
with
a
slightly
more
robust
porter
character
recommended
for
fans
of
porters
and
rye
brews
and
would
serve
quite
nicely
as
an
introduction
to
these
types
of
beer
almost
sessionable
although
the
6
5
abv
would
catch
up
to
the
drinker
sooner
rather
than
later
that
being
said
it
would
be
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
one
all
day
and
or
night
long
drinkability
a
very
easy
drinking
porter
at
6
5
that
i
intend
on
drinking
again
per
the
advice
of
karlhungus
i
also
plain
on
pairing
this
with
bbq
i
can
easily
see
that
would
be
a
solid
pairing
with
this
particular
offering
drinkability
very
good
a
very
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
wonderful
smelling
and
tasting
porter
but
again
it
is
ruined
by
poor
bottling
d
tasty
and
easy
enough
to
drink
with
being
as
heavy
as
it
is
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
poured
aggressively
resulting
in
a
1
finger
tan
head
of
foam
that
lasts
quite
awhile
dark
brown
and
nearly
opaque
it
left
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
starts
with
a
malty
roasty
chocolaty
nose
that
leads
into
a
roasted
toffee
taste
it
has
an
earthy
bitterness
with
a
slight
smoked
flavor
it
finishes
with
a
quite
clean
aftertaste
a
full
mouth
feel
rounds
out
this
filling
high
quality
beer
a
very
impressive
1st
tasting
from
the
flat
earth
brewery
im
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
d
very
good
for
an
english
porter
purchased
in
bomber
at
rum
river
liquor
abv
6
5
this
beer
pours
a
dark
mahogany
almost
black
color
the
head
is
large
creamy
firm
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
a
thick
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
whiskey
oak
and
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
of
oak
vanilla
whiskey
dark
chocolate
and
toffee
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
silky
and
has
adequately
mild
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
porter
it
is
complex
without
being
overpowering
and
is
very
drinkable
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
regular
in
my
fridge
clear
mahogany
a
silky
smooth
light
brown
head
forms
with
the
pour
it
recedes
to
a
thin
pool
of
oily
froth
that
coats
nicely
as
i
drink
very
nice
aroma
chocolatey
and
muddy
and
earthy
and
malty
yeah
lots
of
good
stuff
going
on
there
most
of
that
translates
nice
over
to
the
palate
along
with
a
nice
chalky
dry
cocoa
feel
the
rye
shows
its
face
with
some
spicy
accents
nice
roasty
bitterness
lingers
as
well
this
is
a
very
nice
porter
overall
a
phenomenal
porter
it
fits
the
syle
perfectly
w
a
charming
uniqueness
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
for
sure
i
had
one
the
other
night
and
found
myself
craving
it
all
day
at
work
truely
a
fine
creation
from
a
great
brewery
a
fairly
smooth
and
tasty
porter
theres
a
hint
of
something
like
whiskey
probably
rye
around
the
edges
that
really
comes
out
as
this
beer
warms
and
really
you
need
to
let
this
one
warm
up
the
taste
is
a
subtle
mix
of
chocolate
malts
and
espresso
with
a
very
smooth
body
that
reminds
me
of

porter
not
as
big
and
bold
as
some
american
porters
but
worth
trying
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
came
to
me
with
a
frothy
and
thick
light
brown
head
appearance
is
deep
reddish
brown
almost
black
from
a
distance
once
it
settled
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
bready
goodness
taste
oh
the
taste
lets
see
chocolate
malts
grassy
hops
a
hint
of
smoke
and
oh
so
easy
to
drink
the
grassy
hop
bitterness
balances
really
nice
with
the
dark
malts
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
mouthfeel
and
then
it
would
be
5
for
certain
dont
miss
this
gem
d
very
drinkable
this
beer
drinks
very
easy
and
such
a
nice
mouthfeel
that
you
are
always
left
wanting
more
a
wonderful
tasting
porter
i
hope
to
see
this
beer
in
bottles
soon
in
my
opinion
this
beer
could
easily
rank
up
as
one
of
the
better
porters
out
there
served
chilled
in
a
shaker
pint
served
in
a
flat
earth
snifter
at
the
happy
gnome
unfortunately
that
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
smell
tastes
good
though
i
like
the
roasted
flavors
of
the
porter
and
the
grassy
pilsnerlike
hops
hopefully
it
will
be
bottled
eventually
mouthfeel
felt
rather
thin
but
other
than
that
it
was
a
nice
brew
the
alcohol
is
almost
unnoticeable
so
it
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
for
a
cold
evening
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
what
is
a
solid
porter
was
made
more
interesting
with
the
extra
layer
of
flavor
the
rye
malt
gave
it
maybe
it
just
that
i
havent
had
many
rye
beers
but
i
had
to
think
a
bit
harder
about
what
i
was
tasting
and
i
think
it
helps
that
i
like
whiskey
good
job
flat
earth
on
tap
at
the
muddy
pig
this
pours
a
clear
brownish
black
color
with
a
brownish
head
and
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
raisins
and
malt
the
taste
includes
raisins
plum
a
slightly
smoky
flavor
and
dark
chocolaty
malt
there
is
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
bringing
a
nice
balance
to
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
a
terrific
porter
and
is
yet
another
great
reason
to
drink
flat
earth
beers
way
to
go
on
this
one
fe
good
effort
though
one
of
my
favorite
flat
earths
and
one
ill
try
again
for
sure
good
to
see
more
quality
dark
brews
coming
out
from
the
locals
the
drinkability
is
a
glide
of
fun
solid
porter
taste
and
has
an
easy
going
character
and
complextion
that
seems
simple
but
does
not
approach
any
such
missing
elements
a
well
crafted
brew
by
flat
earth
perfect
for
this
crisper
cooler
autumn
air
dark
pour
with
thin
tan
foam
heavy
roasted
aroma
turning
chocolate
semisweet
in
the
sip
light
clean
finish
pretty
tasty
overall
not
outstanding
in
any
one
area
but
an
interesting
mix
of
aromas
feels
and
tastes
pretty
good
as
a
dry
porter
overall
a
satisfying
porter
a
little
thin
bodied
but
great
flavor
and
balance
love
this
porter
as
well
as
this
brewery
price

696
pk
12
oz
botles
overall
this
is
an
interesting
porter
i
would
buy
a
case
of
this
very
good
rich
with
hints
of
coffee
this
is
quite
a
pleasing
porter
and
i
think
ill
be
checking
out
other
mayflower
brews
very
soon
overall
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
tasted
the
style
can
be
lackluster
in
aroma
and
taste
and
the
body
can
sometimes
be
too
thin
this
excellent
brew
has
character
great
full
body
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
good
mouthfeel
the
best
porter
what
more
needs
to
be
said
i
live
about
15
minutes
from
the
brewery
and
get
a
growler
of
this
about
once
a
week
beyond
delicious
so
well
balanced
toasted
with
a
little
note
of
coffee
at
the
end
perfectly
roasted
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
over
all
a
good
porter
m
ogood
flavor
and
lighter
body
nice
for
the
style
very
dark
brown
fully
opaque
forms
a
large
tan
head
that
takes
a
while
to
settle
down
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
aroma
is
dark
toastyroasty
malts
with
some
lighter
notes
of
pine
taste
is
comprised
of
deeply
roasted
malts
baking
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
not
sure
if
it
is
the
age
of
the
beer
but
unfortunately
this
beer
is
heavily
over
carbonated
giving
it
a
lighter
body
than
it
should
have
and
thinning
out
the
taste
overall
i
could
see
this
beer
having
potential
but
the
carbonation
is
far
too
lively
for
this
to
be
a
worldclass
beer
an
absolutely
delicious
english
porter
the
high
ratings
are
absolutely
justified
it
should
honestly
be
rated
higher
and
talked
about
more
find
this
if
you
can
and
drink
a
ton
of
it
the
beer
packs
wonderful
flavor
and
mouthfeel
for
a
lower
abv
brew
o
with
all
the
high
ratings
im
a
little
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
a
really
well
done
porter
a
must
try
in
mass
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
and
it
didnt
disappoint
fans
of
domestic
porters
should
seek
it
out
its
a
balanced
flavorful
easydrinking
porter
that
should
please
all
dark
beer
fans
overall
very
exceptional
porter
spot
on
for
the
style
overall
spectacular
english
porter
easily
my
favorite
so
far
the
current
trend
is
towards
imperials
but
its
nice
to
find
a
great
regular
porterstout
time
and
again
o
very
good
porter
not
sure
id
take
it
over
a
sierra
nev
porter
edmund
fitz
or
anchor
porter
but
glad
i
had
it
hopefully
mayflower
can
work
on
expanding
its
distribution
as
only
a
few
places
in
my
area
carry
it
it
was
recommended
by
a
bartender
at
mondos
in
middletown
when
i
asked
for
a
dark
beer
she
served
up
a
winner
o
great
beer
would
recommend
to
someone
looking
to
start
a
porter
beer
journey
this
is
definitely
on
the
top
of
my
porter
list
do
highly
drinkable
although
the
plusroastiness
may
lead
to
palate
fatigue
after
a
few
thanks
for
this

o
excellent
porter
lots
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
it
really
just
opens
up
from
there
overall
a
great
porter
especially
if
youre
going
to
have
more
than
a
couple
the
watery
mouthfeel
and
balanced
subtle
flavors
allow
you
to
toss
a
couple
back
without
feeling
weighed
down
and
having
your
palate
overpowered
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
porters
that
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
us
so
smooth
and
creamy
that
i
could
probably
tackle
a
whole
6pack
in
one
setting
overall
awesome
traditional
porter
flavors
serving
type
bottle
o
good
porter
but
could
use
to
be
a
little
bolder
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
and
a
bit
heavier
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
not
on
my
list
of
top
porters
overall
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
o
overall
this
is
a
lightly
smokey
very
easy
drinking
english
porter
not
bad
in
a
pinch
a
strong
stout
with
a
good
taste
pours
dark
black
with
a
semithick
white
foam
head
it
almost
had
a
coffee
smell
and
taste
the
taste
leaves
you
smacking
your
lips
i
was
told
by
a
random
customer
that
this
was
a
good
beer
and
he
was
right
if
you
are
a
fan
of
a
really
good
stout
this
one
is
for
you
poured
into
a
tulip
a
dark
colabrown
almost
black
with
a
thin
creamy
tan
head
about
an
18
inch
thick
which
dissipated
rapidly
with
little
to
no
lacing
the
coffee
aroma
hits
first
than
follows
through
tastewise
and
is
balanced
well
with
the
chocolate
undertone
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
leaves
a
pleasant
puckering
mouthfeel
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
porter
make
no
mistakethis
just
a
heartbeat
away
from
the
founders
porter
a
very
close
second
to
that
fabulous
drink
the
darkest
brown
slightly
opaque
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
into
a
spider
web
of
bubbles
on
the
top
of
the
liquid
after
a
few
minutes
the
smell
is
a
bit
nicer
with
a
heavy
dose
of
chocolate
malt
a
touch
of
roast
malt
and
the
balance
caramels
dark
roasted
coffee
and
bit
of
sweetness
come
through
as
well
the
taste
is
also
very
good
as
with
any
classic
porter
the
chocolate
malt
flavor
dominates
this
is
accentuated
by
coffees
and
roasty
character
bitterness
is
there
as
well
but
primarily
from
the
malt
with
only
low
hop
character
present
typical
of
a
good
english
version
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
tight
and
a
bit
prickly
due
to
some
moderate
to
high
levels
of
carbonation
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
with
just
some
of
the
roast
lingering
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
nothing
overly
challenging
here
just
a
solid
porter
a
style
that
is
often
overlooked
or
made
with
more
hops
a
good
sessionable
beer
that
you
can
drink
all
afternoon
o
overall
a
really
nice
beer
a
porter
that
im
happy
to
have
on
hand
ill
happily
pick
up
another
6pack
if
nothing
else
on
the
racks
jumps
out
at
me
we
have
a
dark
brown
beer
with
ruby
tones
and
a
tanned
bubbly
neck
that
disappears
fast
the
aroma
emanates
coffee
very
well
pronounced
and
chocolate
the
coffee
is
also
very
present
in
the
taste
with
low
fruit
esters
and
discrete
hops
the
malt
gives
the
idea
of
bread
and
toast
slightly
caramelized
with
a
mediumlight
body
the
palate
is
very
oily
and
has
low
carbonation
with
guess
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
very
pleasant
session
beer
for
sure
although
i
expected
more
caramel
expression
in
the
malt
one
of
the
better
local
porters
ive
had
i
will
certainly
revisit
this
one
again
cheers
a
nice
porter
very
user
friendly
and
satisfying
nothing
not
to
like
but
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
either
bitterish
mineral
notes
and
moderately
roasted
coffee
up
front
cocoa
and
chocolate
mix
with
tobacco
and
earthy
peat
midpalate
some
flinty
smoke
notes
caramel
comes
on
late
accented
by
licorice
vanilla
and
molasses
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
bitterness
in
the
finish
lingering
caramel
and
vanilla
medium
bodied
with
slightly
prickly
feel
body
feels
maybe
a
pinch
light
for
a
porter
but
still
pretty
good
might
be
transcendent
on
cask
still
i
would
recommend
this
porter
to
someone
who
has
never
had
one
ive
been
intending
to
review
this
for
a
while
ive
had
samples
of
it
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
its
always
been
exceptional
its
not
going
to
blow
any
minds
but
its
a
very
tasty
porter
especially
for
the
surprisingly
low
abv
well
done
overall
this
is
a
very
delicious
porter
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
id
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
an
english
porter
that
is
done
accurately
good
brew
and
i
will
definitely
buy
again
o
this
porter
does
not
mess
around
compare
w
otter
creeks
stovepipe
porter
mayflower
porter
requires
no
further
search
or
consideration
it
was
obvious
right
from
the
outset
that
this
is
a
worldclass
porter
through
and
through
when
it
comes
to
brewing
hearty
porters
no
one
yields
a
sharper
bayonet
than
the
americans
its
hard
to
find
anything
to
nitpick
about
in
this
quintessential
robust
porter
overall
a
tasty
brew
mayflower
porter
is
a
nice
traditional
interpretation
of
the
style
what
i
really
enjoyed
about
this
beer
was
the
slightly
smokey
dark
chocolate
aftertaste
worth
a
try
it
has
nice
and
not
overpowering
smoky
and
chocolate
flavors
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
pleasing
i
also
feel
a
nice
bitterness
from
the
hops
on
my
tongue
this
beer
is
nothing
extreme
but
it
is
a
very
nice
balanced
porter
the
best
american
english
porter
ive
had
absolutely
phenomenal
all
the
flavors
pop
o
a
fantastic
beer
of
this
style
that
i
will
most
certainly
drink
again
highly
recommended
o
a
very
solid
porter
across
the
board
very
balanced
and
the
drinkability
is
solid
as
well
the
taste
is
full
of
burnt
coffee
and
burnt
toast
there
is
a
slight
bitter
hop
finish
the
taste
is
flavorful
and
hits
the
roasted
drinkable
porter
spot
this
drinks
nice
and
light
with
sharp
carbonation
the
body
is
robust
and
silky
with
soft
carbonation
real
enjoyable
here
well
made
and
solid
all
around
taste
is
chocolate
milk
shake
and
some
herbal
flavor
just
for
some
tang
good
medium
body
great
porter
i
really
like
this
beer
real
respect
for
the
style
and
the
gives
me
the
impression
that
this
is
what
a
style
of
this
sort
tasted
like
way
back
m
creamy
rich
and
extremely
drinkable
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
has
some
coffee
bitterness
at
the
back
of
it
decent
body
throughout
the
palate
and
a
nice
finish
a
good
beer
for
sure
appearance
is
dark
brown
a
small
tannish
head
a
pleasant
look
the
nose
on
this
porter
is
oatmeal
malts
some
coffee
and
brown
sugar
its
taste
has
earthy
grains
chocolate
malts
and
chocolate
continue
to
make
their
presence
known
here
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
a
very
easy
drinking
porter
a
solid
beer
from
this
small
brewery
outta
mass
o
very
very
solid
good
representation
of
the
style
always
awesome
to
have
a
world
class
porter
readily
available
hell
the
brewery
is
a
20
min
drive
for
me
pours
black
with
a
good
light
mocha
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
thin
cap
for
a
bit
the
nose
is
really
nice
with
plenty
of
chocolate
along
with
a
good
roast
balance
slight
coffee
in
the
background
the
flavor
isnt
as
well
melded
too
much
roast
there
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
good
the
beer
is
dark
brown
nearing
black
with
a
quarter
inch
of
beige
head
the
aroma
brings
roasted
malt
in
the
english
style
toffee
dark
fruits
hints
of
chocolate
the
flavor
brings
toasted
malt
roast
alcohol
toffee
pretty
tasty
medium
to
light
bodied
overall
very
drinkable
and
tasty
would
happily
throw
back
a
pint
of
this
on
another
occasion
o
this
is
a
delicious
porter
and
its
easy
to
drink
lots
of
it
not
a
complex
or
nuanced
beer
its
pretty
straightforward
if
youre
an
old
school
english
brown
ale
fan
youll
be
all
about
this
really
tame
the
further
you
go
east
the
more
likely
this
beer
will
be
raved
about
it
seems
decent
stuff
thanks
to
whomever
threw
this
in
as
an
extra
a
nice
change
of
pace
decent
palate
cleanser
for
when
drinking
the
heavier
beers
thanks
to
cbeer88
for
sending
me
this
beer
definately
a
great
porter
great
overall
except
the
mouthfeel
this
would
probably
be
great
a
little
colder
and
thicker
overall
very
good
porter
overall
really
nice
offering
and
certainly
worth
the
asking
price
if
its
below
10
a
sixer
i
have
no
idea
what
this
costs
out
east
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
why
i
dont
absolutely
love
this
but
i
dont
nonetheless
a
really
tasty
porter
this
is
everything
a
man
wants
in
his
porter
beefy
roasted
malt
nice
balanced
hop
flavor
lighter
in
body
without
sacrificing
big
strong
flavor
you
show
me
a
man
who
doesnt
like
this
beer
and
ill
show
you
a
man
who
should
take
his
popped
collar
and
go
order
some
bud
lites
it
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
good
mayflower
did
it
right
when
they
picked
out
this
recipe
overall
this
is
an
excellent
porter
though
i
suspect
many
will
find
the
flavors
more
stoutlike
in
their
pronounced
bitterness
still
the
brew
is
nuanced
finely
crafted
and
quite
delicious
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
1
12
finger
tan
colored
head
the
smell
is
slightly
roasty
with
a
good
hop
presence
the
flavor
is
a
little
hop
flavor
up
front
kind
of
floral
followed
by
a
slightly
sweet
roasty
malt
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
tiny
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fuller
than
i
would
expect
for
this
style
but
the
carbonation
is
just
right
overall
this
beer
is
absolutely
phenomenal
o
had
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
a
while
and
now
wish
i
had
opened
it
earlier
will
have
to
grab
some
more
of
this
next
time
i
am
back
up
in
ma
o
goes
down
well
would
drink
another
overall
a
great
traditional
porter
that
stays
true
to
its
roots
very
impressed
with
this
brew
as
it
is
one
of
the
lighter
colored
porters
i
have
had
and
doesnt
compromise
flavor
pours
a
tar
like
black
with
a
small
quickly
dissipating
light
brown
head
aroma
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
faint
roasted
coffee
notes
flavor
begins
with
sweet
chocolate
notes
a
bit
of
roasted
coffee
molasses
and
a
nice
smokiness
round
out
this
perfect
example
of
a
porter
great
smoothness
well
rounded
and
again
just
a
classic
example
of
a
simple
porter
profile
d
very
drinkable
a
good
little
above
average
porter
d
this
is
an
outstanding
porter
really
nice
flavor
profile
that
is
balanced
and
delicious
i
would
drink
this
often
if
it
were
available
around
here
good
introduction
to
this
brewery
starts
off
with
great
smells
roasted
coffee
beans
bakers
chocolate
and
surprisingly
a
little
booziness
for
the
lower
abv
standard
porter
appearance
dark
black
with
little
opacity
tan
head
with
little
lacing
medium
mouthfeel
actually
a
little
waterier
than
i
expected
tastes
similar
to
smells
some
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
background
with
a
distinct
roasted
maltiness
and
hints
of
annis
bitter
smoky
finish
that
doesnt
linger
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
solid
porter
that
goes
down
easily
this
is
a
nice
porter
well
worth
it
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
d
very
much
to
the
style
sessionable
abv
smooth
eventually
but
not
creamy
mouthfeel
and
loads
of
roast
very
nice
poured
a
dark
brown
with
an
averaged
sized
frothy
light
brown
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
of
roasted
caramel
malts
a
sort
of
barnyard
scented
yeast
and
strong
notes
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
it
tasted
slightly
sweet
and
quite
flavorful
with
notes
of
coffee
and
caramel
at
first
and
then
a
bitter
sweet
chocolatecoffee
flavor
engulfed
the
taste
buds
and
stayed
with
you
for
a
nice
little
while
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
in
body
and
a
little
oily
in
texture
with
a
nice
soft
carbonation
overall
a
nice
straight
forward
porter
good
stuff
drinkability
is
great
nice
balance
good
depth
tasty
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
pretty
smooth
going
down
almost
a
touch
more
american
brown
like
than
english
porter
but
i
dig
it
thanks
russ
this
beer
is
absolutely
wonderful
the
perfect
porter
ive
been
drinking
mayflower
for
a
few
years
now
and
i
like
their
others
but
my
love
always
lies
with
the
porter
the
appearance
is
dark
and
the
smell
is
of
light
coffee
and
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
some
good
hops
a
nice
full
mouthful
with
a
great
hoppy
finish
and
dark
chocolate
aftertones
like
i
said
perfect
the
way
porter
should
be
d
a
solid
porter
would
make
an
excellent
goto
and
session
style
brew
d
a
quintessential
sessionable
porter
moderate
abv
smooth
pleasant
flavors
refreshing
as
it
has
sat
and
warmed
here
in
the
glass
a
smoky
flavor
from
the
nose
has
developed
d
the
strongest
ale
of
the
evening
but
youd
never
know
it
a
nice
porter
d
i
overall
really
like
this
beer
there
are
plenty
of
breweries
out
there
trying
to
do
what
this
brewery
did
with
this
style
sometimes
i
dont
want
big
beer
though
not
that
often
anymore
i
am
also
trending
to
darker
brews
so
this
one
is
the
prefect
fit
when
i
want
a
sixer
deep
dark
brown
with
a
good
head
and
nice
lace
the
smell
is
well
balanced
chocolate
coffee
and
roast
the
taste
is
the
same
very
well
balcned
and
drinkable
mayflower
rules
medium
bodied
and
slightly
smokey
with
plenty
of
roasted
malt
flavor
hints
of
chocolate
hazelnut
and
caramel
decent
balance
of
sweet
and
roasted
notes
with
a
bone
dry
finish
drinkability
is
quite
high
with
this
one
a
lower
abv
and
a
lighter
body
would
probably
allow
for
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
d
drinkability
is
moderately
high
the
flavors
are
nice
and
bold
but
the
watery
bitter
finish
detracts
a
bit
love
this
style
and
love
this
one
db
a
good
porter
with
a
very
nice
roast
malt
feel
an
example
of
the
style
that
i
think
anyone
who
likes
roast
characters
in
beer
would
enjoy
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
that
quickly
settles
to
form
a
nice
collar
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
roast
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
leather
medium
mouthfeel
a
balanaced
taste
between
the
roast
coffee
flavors
and
the
sweetness
from
the
dark
chocolate
notes
slight
leather
with
a
hint
of
smoke
as
well
slight
bitterness
lingers
on
to
me
this
is
slightly
bland
upfront
easy
drinking
though
notes
this
is
a
very
solid
porter
i
was
blown
away
when
i
first
tried
it
and
now
it
has
become
an
old
familiar
friend
i
probably
buy
more
of
this
than
any
other
beer
on
the
market
thats
saying
a
lot
being
that
im
a
promiscuous
drinker
by
nature
this
is
one
one
of
the
better
porters
out
there
and
very
well
crafted
it
flies
off
the
shelves
here
so
i
always
make
it
a
point
to
grab
some
when
i
see
it
a
deep
brown
opaque
with
tan
hues
on
the
edge
a
nice
head
with
good
lacing
the
nose
has
brown
bread
molasses
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
a
very
complex
taste
follows
brown
breads
chocolate
molasses
some
slightly
roasted
nuts
a
touch
of
acrid
bitterness
and
some
sweetness
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
good
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
worth
a
session
drinkable
yes
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
black
with
some
light
brown
tint
aromas
of
smoke
roasted
grains
hints
of
of
earthy
notes
as
well
starts
of
with
a
burst
of
burnt
almonds
plum
and
raisin
also
dominate
the
palate
finishes
off
quite
smooth
with
lingiring
smoke
after
taste
well
done
porter
d
excellent
beer
this
one
has
got
me
wanting
to
revisit
this
style
as
the
weather
cools
off
quite
possibly
a
perfect
porter
by
modernday
standards
what
we
dig
about
mayflowers
version
is
that
it
leans
toward
the
english
style
which
tends
to
be
more
balanced
wellattenuated
and
sessionable
delicious
d
superbly
drinkable
as
in
gone
too
quickly
rich
and
savory
its
a
porter
id
absolutely
seek
out
again
excellent
example
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
some
excellent
crystalchocolate
malt
notes
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
very
enjoyable
black
and
chocolate
malt
flavor
it
has
a
nice
roasted
feel
with
a
balanced
flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
chocolate
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
tremendous
porter
its
full
of
character
a
fine
session
ale
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
with
good
retention
strong
smells
of
roasted
malt
smoke
and
chocolate
notes
bitter
hop
taste
noticable
coupled
with
dark
roasty
malts
with
some
coffee
notes
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
limited
carbination
an
excellent
and
unique
porter
on
par
with
fullers
this
beer
finishes
well
much
more
beautifully
than
it
begins
every
fortnight
i
get
the
malt
shakes
when
this
happens
again
this
will
probably
be
the
beer
i
pick
up
overall
a
very
good
beer
probably
wont
buy
it
again
exclusively
because
of
the
high
price
though
d
an
excellent
porter
its
right
up
there
with
fullers
as
one
of
my
favorites
mayflower
continue
to
deliver
quality
stuff
big
mayflower
fan
good
brew
i
have
been
avoiding
porters
with
the
heat
of
summer
lately
and
found
this
offering
to
be
very
enjoyable
very
solid
example
i
would
drink
this
again
if
given
the
chance
i
am
happy
to
try
this
beer
everything
deserves
a
chance
and
this
beer
is
miles
above
some
trash
ive
slurped
down
in
my
day
however
i
will
not
be
looking
for
this
beer
again
i
will
not
order
this
beer
if
i
find
it
on
draft
out
and
about
maybe
ill
sip
it
a
few
times
if
someone
else
orders
it
i
put
it
as
a
suitable
craft
beer
but
not
a
good
craft
beer
a
nice
enjoyable
porter
overall
wow
my
new
favorite
at
first
sip
can
taste
the
malts
which
are
outstanding
but
i
am
blown
away
by
the
body
mayflower
has
created
a
new
gem
i
expect
a
porter
with
this
taste
and
feel
to
need
an
89
abv
in
order
to
carry
it
off
but
to
manage
this
with
only
5
5
is
amazing
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
issue
is
finding
it
is
constantly
sold
out
locally
pours
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
ring
leaving
some
lace
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
black
color
no
highlights
nose
is
roasted
chocolate
flavor
is
roasted
almost
burnt
chocolate
1
85
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
mid
bodied
and
easy
drinking
carbonation
seems
sightly
high
on
this
bottle
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
problem
this
brew
was
a
surprise
gem
and
i
hope
to
see
it
again
d
wow
one
of
if
not
the
best
porters
ive
ever
had
and
at
5
5
i
could
drink
plenty
more
remarkable
mouth
drinkability
a
little
more
crispness
here
would
go
a
long
way
i
think
and
would
take
both
the
feel
and
drinkability
to
the
next
level
dark
brown
with
clear
edges
a
modest
cap
of
fine
light
tan
bubbles
appeared
during
the
pour
and
settled
to
a
collar
and
thin
surface

over
a
few
minutes
time
a
bit
of
spotty

caramel
charcoal
or
perhaps
a
hint
of
smoke
nutty
milk
chocolate
faint

a
bit

dry

balanced
towards
sweetness
with
moderate

malty
up

brown
sugar
charcoal
toffee
lingering
bitterness
and
herbal
hop
character
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
slightly
astringent
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
enjoyed
notes
a
great
english
porter
a
good
example
of
the
style
cheers
this
is
great
porter
with
a
nice
mix
of
sweetness
and
roasted
character
which
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
and
complex
at
the
same
time
excellent
beer
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
there
is
a
slight
off
meat
flavor
in
the
beer
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
good
qualities
and
is
very
tasty
d
this
is
just
a
fantastic
beer
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
by
this
and
would
have
no
problem
opening
another
one
of
these
feeldrink
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
and
smooth
drinkablity
is
superb
appearance
is
a
very
dark
brown
nice
and
creamy
very
full
looking
while
pouring
it
leaves
a
thin
bubbly
head
with
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
malty
milkduds
and
some
roastiness
slight
burnt
coffee
and
a
slight
woodsy
quality
taste
is
where
this
beer
shines
it
tastes
damn
good
small
hop
bite
with
coffee
notes
some
chocolate
and
again
milkduds
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
with
a
nice
dry
finish
drinkability
is
high
and
carbonation
is
smooth
letting
you
focus
on
the
flavors
i
wish
i
had
more
to
enjoy
a
very
nice
porter
flavor
has
a
nice
measure
of
coffee
notes
of
chocolate
on
the
back
side
again
a
roasted
flavor
is
large
creamy
light
body
more
roasted
malts
toasted
barley
pretty
tasty
d
this
is
a
well
crafted
porter
that
i
think
more
people
should
try
its
not
a
heavy
hitter
by
any
means
but
in
the
long
run
it
is
a
well
made
craft
beer
sessionable
and
enjoyable
an
excellent
american
made
porter
in
the
english
style
we
did
a
porter
tasting
with
some
of
the
better
rated
ones
from
this
site
side
by
side
this
did
not
impress
the
color
is
almost
straight
black
but
there
is
a
slight
dark
brownpurplish
hue
this
has
very
little
lacing
and
head
looks
like
a
pepsi
i
am
getting
a
faint
amount
of
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
and
a
small
bit
of
dark
fruit
nothing
special
the
taste
is
fairly
dry
and
watery
there
is
good
balance
for
sure
between
hops
and
malt
overall
it
is
very
thin
with
not
enough
flavor
for
us
as
compared
to
some
others
try
the
ipa
by
mayflower
it
is
solid
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
represents
the
style
well
and
is
drinkable
i
am
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
and
i
could
easily
drink
another
everything
just
seems
to
work
well
this
beer
it
is
simple
but
complex
at
the
same
time
worth
a
try
the
finish
is
very
dry
almost
too
dry
for
my
taste
drinkability
suffers
for
this
but
its
good
for
one
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
full
flavored
and
well
carbonated
there
is
a
nice
dry
finish
and
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
by
the
flavors
as
it
should
be
for
a
nice
sessionable
porter
i
could
easily
finish
off
the
six
pack
i
have
and
still
want
more
this
is
a
great
session
beer
a
great
example
of
a
basic
porter
another
impressive
beer
from
mayflower
glad
to
have
it
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
yet
mayflower
porter
is
my
favorite
of
their
lineup
great
dark
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
sticks
for
a
while
roasted
malt
flavor
with
nice
subtle
notes
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
tastes
similar
to
fullers
london
porter
which
is
saying
alot
because
i
consider
that
to
be
god
of
all
porters
the
porter
which
all
english
style
porters
should
strive
for
and
this
brew
nails
it
next
review
very
drinkable
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
so
full
of
flavor
definitly
on
of
my
top
3
favorite
porters
at
5
5
abv
this
makes
an
exceptional
session
beer
d
easy
sipping
really
smooth
and
light
could
easily
throw
a
lot
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
down
i
would
put
it
up
there
with
smuttynose
as
one
to
try
drinkability
was
decent
for
one
but
i
wasnt
raring
to
have
another
this
wasnt
bad
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
this
is
a
fantastic
porter
goes
perfectly
with
a
dessert
highly
drinkable
because
its
not
too
heavy
d
this
porter
is
rich
and
deserves
to
be
drank
next
to
a
warm
fire
this
beer
is
without
a
doubt
rich
and
complex
but
in
a
very
simple
way
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
night
d
to
me
this
is
exactly
what
an
porter
should
be
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
flavorful
alternative
to
my
favorite
lighter
session
brews
if
i
had
access
to
this
it
would
frequently
be
in
my
fridge
12oz
bottle
served
at
51
degrees
in
my
sa
sensory
pint
no
freshness
dating
indicated
on
the
bottle
poured
the
color
of
cola
with
some
deep
red
almost
brown
highlights
when
backlit
pour
revealed
a
frothysudsy
two
inch
khakicolored
head
that
crackled
and
popped
as
it
slowly
receded
into
a
fairly
consistent
quarter
inch
cap
with
thick
swaths
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
off
the
bottle
pop
was
coffee
roasty
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
smoked
meat
a
la
rauchbier
nose
in
the
glass
is
a
bit
more
subdued
light
coffee
aromas
and
something
else
hard
to
tease
out
maybe
a
hint
of
lactose
and
something
else
taste
follows
nose
smoky
character
definitely
remains
but
i
also
get
a
slightly
metallic
quality
as
well
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
carbonation
levels
that
approach
prickly
however
this
beer
is
also
a
bit
gassy
not
a
bad
porter
by
any
means
but
a
little
too
much
co2
happening
here
i
might
have
to
try
another
bottle
as
some
small
beer
stains
on
the
label
might
be
indicative
of
an
off
bottle
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
just
like
the
carbonation
it
doesnt
do
much
on
the
palate
but
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
either
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
see
this
working
well
with
a
good
steak
or
a
few
relaxing
pints
d
more
drinkable
than
i
may
give
it
credit
for
i
just
cant
really
do
much
of
these
very
um
colonial
this
is
a
much
better
beer
a
worthy
on
tap
imo
d
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
complex
porter
style
flavor
profile
this
is
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
the
porter
style
and
one
that
would
be
great
on
a
cool
autumn
day
as
a
session
beer
damn
good
drinkability
good
flavor
not
too
strong
complex
worth
a
try
and
wish
i
had
some
more
quite
a
treat
not
just
because
its
very
good
but
because
it
presents
a
number
of
unusual
flavors
a
very
thick
head
allbutblack
color
and
aromas
of
toast
roast
beef
and
celery
and
even
burning
electrical
wires
not
bad
in
my
book
it
has
a
dense
body
with
moderate
fizz
that
burns
a
bit
on
the
tongue
theres
much
complexity
in
the
taste
but
prominent
flavors
are
roasted
nuts
caramel
more
celery
wet
earth
sausages
and
perhaps
roasted
potatoes
dry
finish
with
a
mild
tilt
of
bitterness
at
the
end
not
the
greatest
american
porter
ive
had
that
honor
goes
to
berkshire
brewing
co
but
unusual
and
excellent
nonetheless

slightly
sweetened
with

soft

with
a
creamy
feel
and

very
drinkable
im
starting
to
appreciate
porters
more
and
more
and
this
is
just
another
stepping
stone
great
representation
of
the
style
i
need
more

all
the
mayflowers

i
could
almost
have
this
with
breakfast
or
with
a
hearty

please
try
this

dark

quaff
has
subtle
notes
of
gritty
burnt
bread
amongst
the
dark

backbone
tad
thin
bodied
but
it
drinks
well
on
this
cool
july
evening
in
the
midwest
not
tasting
any
sour
ale
as
a
porter
should
have
but
it
nevertheless
is
a
tasty
treat
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
definitely
take
a
chance
on
this
porter
if
you
get
the
opportunity
as
it
is
delicious
nothing
but
quality
in
this
beer
and
all
of
the
aromas
and
tastes
prove
that
great
job
on
your
porter
mayflower
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
porter
by
any
standards
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
d
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
porter
style
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
bitter
very
good
beer
great
example
of
a
wellexecuted
porter
is
this
so
hard
why
cant
more
brewers
get
this
style
to
taste
so
good
my
first
mayflower
id
be
happy
to
sample
another
of
these
or
anything
else
their
peddling
props
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
deep
dark
brown
with
slight
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
a
nice
creamy

taste
is
of

first
then
a

mixed
caramel
malts
with
toffee
and
chocolate
and
finishes
with
a
nice
coffee

some
bitterness
is
left
on
the
tongue
in
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
medium
to
high
carbonation
rich
creamy
feel
at
first
but
the
carbonation
lightens
this
beer
up
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
this
is
one
for
an
entire
evening
this
beer
poured
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
there
was
a
nice
rich
dark
chocolate
aroma
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
full
there
was
a
nice
chocolate
taste
with
a
mild
bitterness
and
dryness
in
the
finish
the
after
taste
was
a
nice
balance
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
porter
pours
an
opaque
blackbrown
color
with
creamy
brown
foam
that
persists
and
clings
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
nice
roasty
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
coffee
and
cocoa
the
taste
has
cocoa
and
light
coffee
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
it
is
dry
overall
bitterness
builds
to
the
finish
passing
a
touch
of
light
fruitiness
in
the
middle
and
ending
with
dry
coffee
and
chocolate
overtones
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
dry
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
this
is
quite
a
nice
porter
d
infinitely
so
darker
and
more
flavorpacked
than
a
boring
brown
ale
and
lighter
on
the
stomach
than
most
stouts
this
beer
is
great
with
a
steak
or
solo
a
bit
too
much
of
a
punch
to
be
sessionable
but
the
strong
flavors
make
this
a
perfect
slow
drinker
that
you
will
savor
to
the
last
drop
this
is
a
fine
session
beer
its
very
flavorful
and
not
overpowering
yet
its
not
a
beer
that
grows
bland
after
youve
had
a
couple
d
very
tasty
porter
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
or
cask
d
this
porter
has
a
lot
of
character
which
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
are
quite
pronounced
and
lively
this
is
definitely
not
a
boring
run
of
the
mill
porter
reviewed
on
phone
drinkability
this
to
me
is
typical
mayflower
they
take
a
style
analyze
it
and
do
it
very
well
that
being
said
it
does
not
push
the
boundaries
of
its
style
for
an
english
porter
this
is
excellent
and
i
could
drink
six
i
would
love
to
see
mayflower
do
some
more
extreme
beers
on
the
dryer
roastier
side
all
the
way
through
against
the
back
of
the
palate
features
what
almost
is
like
bitter
bakers
chocolate
with
a
semisweetness
like
the
sweetness
from
the
smell
finishes
with
an
alcoholic
flourish
leaves
a
slight
chalkyness
on
the
tongue
after
its
finished
the
flavors
are
there
but
left
sort
of
lifeless
in
the
mouth
worth
it
for
the
flavor
but
the
end
presentation
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
a
very
good
example
of
an
english
porter
i
wish
this
one
was
available
around
here
pours
black
with
brownish
highlights
and
a
thin
swirly
tan
head
a
bit
of
licorice
and
roastiness
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
a
slight
coffee
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
with
maybe
the
barest
hint
of
dark
fruit
at
the
end
nicely
balanced
and
the
brambly
fruit
comes
out
a
bit
more
as
it
warms
the
tiniest
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
but
this
also
gets
better
as
it
warms
with
a
bit
of
prickliness
just
enough
not
to
be
unpleasant
helping
add
some
crispness
to
the
porter
quite
solid
one
that
i
would
definitely
drink
were
it
local
quite
dry
and
fairly
light
and
not
as
roasty
as
some
but
very
well
balanced
and
with
some
nicely
nuanced
flavors
this
pours
an
attractive
dark
brown
with
hints
of
red
when
held
up
to
bright
light
there
are
about
two
fingers
of
foamy
beige
head
that
takes
an
extended
period
of
time
to
dissolve
it
never
really
goes
away
the
aroma
is
smoked
and
of
clean
hops
it
seems
well
balanced
in
that
regard
the
mouthfeel
is
better
than
medium
and
the
taste
is
a
little
hopped
but
mainly
smoky
and
slightly
raisinlike
overall
a
good
beer
and
very
close
to
what
a
well
done
english
porter
should
be
it
went
down
very
easy
with
no
harsh
edges
very
very
easy
to
down
these
overall
i
liked
it
but
was
a
somewhat
underwhelmed
perhaps
it
is
because
so
much
is
overdone
these
days
that
we
forget
what
a
simple
standard
good
brew
can
be
like
ive
had
much
better
and
much
much
worse
for
the
style
still
id
buy
this
again
a
nicely
drinkable
porter
something
i
will
probably
have
again
due
to
the
pretty
good
price
it
can
be
found
at
around
here
received
this
one
in
trade
as
an
extra
i
think
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
2
finger
off
whitetan
head
that
faded
after
a
while
and
left
barely
any
lacing
on
the
glass
smelled
a
little
bitter
coffee
roasted
malts
stoutish
tasted
nutty
cold
coffee
roasted
malt
flavors
med
bodied
overall
a
decent
but
not
extraordinary
beer
d
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
porter
it
wasnt
lacking
really
but
seemed
simple
w
a
basic
malt
profile
simple
is
good
but
to
me
it
was
lacking
in
drinkability
i
wanted
to
try
something
else
12
way
in
i
should
probably
try
a
bottle
later
for
comparison
i
really
love
this
beer
i
will
be
drinking
lots
of
this
in
the
future
i
am
proud
to
have
a
local
beer
that
i
am
this
fond
of
i
love
a
well
done
porter
and
this
is
a
great
one
poured
into
my
nonic
tumbler
and
appears
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
healthy
two
fingers
of
creamy
tan
colored
head
smells
of
richly
roasted
malts
cocoa
powder
and
bready
grain
tastes
of
dark
roasted
grains
chocolate
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
coffee
medium
body
and
carbonation
picked
this
up
as
a
single
at
julios
wish
i
would
have
threw
a
whole
sixer
in
the
cart
good
body
good
smooth
feel
and
easy
to
drink
a
fav
style
of
mine
and
a
great
example
love
to
have
it
again
some
time
pours

very
dark

from

one

roastiness
in
the
background

flavors
hints
of
coffee
and
vanilla
plus
a
good
smack
of
caramel
mediumfull

creamy
delicious
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
very
good
porter
bordering
on
great
i
only
wish
i
had
more
than
one
of
these
this
beer
came
to
me
in
the
bif
trade
and
i
am
glad
i
recieved
it
overall
well
rounded
porter
with
a
classic
taste
that
looks
fantastic
d
notes
a
really
nice
nose
that
doesnt
quite
carry
through
to
the
taste
a
good
session
beer

the
spot

dark

like
it

fits
well

5i
couldnt
help
but
compare
this
one
to
my
own
english
porter
and
for
me
as
it
makes
for
a
complex
session
brew
this
ranks
as
one
of
the
better
porters
i
have
sampled
in
recent
memory
a
trip
to
the
brewery
is
more
than
worth
it
surprisingly
this
porter
goes
down
easy
and
light
my
mouth
wanted
more
after
my
first
sip
and
i
feel
i
could
have
obliged
it
a
few
more
pints
quite
easily
had
on
tap
at
union
brewhouse
excited
to
try
it
from
a
local
brewery
and
one
of
my
fave
styles
good
looking
beer
blackish
brown
with
nice
tan
one
finger
head
aromas
of
roasted
malts
some
chocolate
coffee
first
sip
has
a
wonderful
smokey
flavor
then
gets
balanced
out
with
the
malty
flavors
chocolate
being
most
obvious
medium
to
full
body
so
it
is
pretty
hearty
for
a
porter
and
a
bit
richer
and
smooter
also
still
very
drinkable
had
about
3
the
first
time
and
keep
going
back
for
more
beautiful
chocolate
black
color
with
average
head
tan
in
color
and
good
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
malt
forward
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
elements
taste
is
rich
in
chocolate
and
coffee
nice
balance
between
the
two
mouthfeel
is
excellent
chewy
chocolatey
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
a
little
too
coffee
for
my
personal
preference
but
very
drinkable
porter
this
one
is
infected
unfortunately
i
can
taste
the
underlying
english
porter
flavors
i
want
but
its
masked
by
sourness
the
nose
is
similarly
off
reminding
me
more
of
sour
milk
than
dark
ale
im
willing
to
try
another
one
at
some
point
but
this
was
one
i
poured
out
o
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
this
has
a
90
after
drinking
it
lets
just
say
im
not
id
even
say
its
top
10
among
the
style
this
has
great
chocolate
flavors
yet
the
roastedhoppy
bitterness
balances
it
beautifully
a
classic
example
of
an
undertheradar
gem
this
beer
was
better
than
the
st
george
ipa
i
reviewed
last
but
apparently
it
was
also
past
its
prime
hopefully
i
will
get
a
chance
to
try
them
both
again
with
fresher
versions
o
not
sure
why
this
has
such
a
high
ba
score
since
its
pretty
much
like
every
other
average
porter
ive
had
the
only
thing
that
makes
it
stand
out
is
the
aroma
o
overall
a
great
example
of
a
porter
will
most
definitely
get
a
few
more
after
summer
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
very
dark
colaish
reddish
brown
with
a
large
rocky
beige
head
too
dark
to
tell
what
kind
of
bubble
action
is
occurring
in
the
darkness
aroma
is
of
roasted
smoky
malt
1st
sip
brings
to
mind
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
and
black
coffee
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
overall
a
tasty
refreshing
porter
that
i
would
not
mind
having
again
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
roasted
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
and
some
caramel
it
tastes
like
roasted
malt
milk
and
bittersweet
chocolate
caramel
cream
and
a
bit
of
burntcharred
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
one
of
my
friends
picked
up
a
single
bottle
of
this
for
me
on
a
recent
trip
and
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
i
would
certainly
buy
this
beer
again
out
of
all
of
the
st
george
brews
that
i
have
had
this
is
my
least
favorite
but
going
up
against
many
of
their
other
choices
is
a
hard
contest
i
look
forward
to
all
the
options
this
brewer
has
to
offer
o
this
is
just
a
good
all
around
beer
that
doesnt
disappoint
in
any
category
the
aroma
has
a
nice
blend
of
hops
with
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
and
the
flavor
is
just
as
enjoyable
and
seems
to
improve
as
the
beer
warms
this
porter
is
my
favorite
offering
from
st
george
thus
far
and
is
one
that
id
definitely
grab
a
six
pack
of
in
the
future
this
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
12
finger
tan
head
that
retains
well
smells
of
cocoa
coffee
and
roasted
malts
nice
smelling
beer
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
much
more
of
the
malts
coming
through
as
it
warms
plenty
of
bitter
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
a
nice
porter
overall
a
good
porter
esp
nice
on
a
cooler
evening
o
an
excellent
porter
although
porters
arent
my
favourite
style
of
beer
i
can
see
myself
reaching
for
another
of
these
in
the
future
o
st
george
brewing
co
has
done
a
good
job
with
this
porter
while
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
porters
i
think
this
is
a
fine
example
of
what
a
porter
should
be
4
0
o
goes
down
easy
relatively
tasty
not
filling
minor
kick
ok
representation
of
style
this
isnt
a
blow
your
mind
porter
but
its
worth
sitting
with
for
a
while
great
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
big
thanks
goes
out
to
drabmuh
for
sending
me
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
past
trade
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
pitch
black
with
a
three
finger
very
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
one
finger
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
tobacco
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
and
tobacco
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
an
almost
creamy
texture
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
it
was
almost
spot
on
for
the
style
it
was
targeting
without
a
doubt
the
flavors
on
it
were
very
light
and
refreshing
which
might
have
been
its
only
downfall
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
robust
flavors
in
this
one
going
into
it
but
it
did
well
with
what
it
had
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
was
quite
excellent
though
a
definite
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
o
worth
every
penny
try
some
store
some
thoroughly
black
this
beer
has
a
slim
tan
head
its
aroma
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
dark
roast
coffee
ripe
fruit
and
dark
bread
there
is
a
fleeting
chocolate
smell
as
well
no
real
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
semisweet
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
nice
malt
and
grain
favor
lots
of
roasted
coffeelike
flavors
the
beer
has
the
feeling
of
a
higher
abv
than
it
actually
is
mediumfull
in
mouthfeel
the
body
is
great
nice
brew
very
drinkable
great
dark
roasted
malt
and
avoids
the
sour
taste
of
more
austere
versions
enjoyed
at
capital
ale
house
in
downtown
fredericksburg
va
overall
a
very
nice
porter
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
enjoyed
this
on
not
quite
the
most
complex
porter
ive
ever
had
but
it
was
extremely
drinkable
i
had
two
of
them
with
dinner
dark
brown
nearly
black
just
a
touch
of
light
brown
head
average
retention
and
little
lacing
dry
lightly
roasty
nose
taste
has
a
good
bit
graininess
as
well
with
more
neutral
malt
sweetness
than
i
was
expecting
but
still
rather
dry
overall
roasty
toastiness
but
not
a
ton
of
flavor
overall
lighter
medium
body
good
moderate
carbonation
could
use
more
body
good
creaminess
for
how
light
it
is
better
than
some
of
their
other
beers
but
still
no
treat
hopefully
the
rest
in
the
pack
will
be
good
overall
drinkability
despite
the
singularity
of
coffeelike
bitterness
in
this
one
i
rather
like
it
but
then
i
also
like
my
coffee
black
so
i
think
that
has
something
to
do
with
it
i
can
drink
this
by
itself
and
i
think
it
would
go
really
well
with
beef
or
pork
not
really
a
sipper
and
indeed
it
went
rather
fast
but
i
think
it
becomes
better
once
fully
warmed
up
and
a
mix
of
american
and
english
porter
styles
comes
out
other
than
the
lack
of
smell
a
good
beer
an
easy
drinker
of
a
beer
low
abv
but
a
boring
beer
for
its
style
it
lacked
any
brown
sugar
or
toffee
notes
and
its
flavors
were
pretty
muted
maybe
i
got
an
old
bottle
its
not
distributed
in
my
area
so
not
sure
when
i
will
get
a
chance
to
try
it
again
for
now
it
was
fore
getable
dinteresting
but
i
would
probably
not
seek
this
one
out
wonderful
porter
fantastic
after
taste
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
a
little
bit
grainy
not
unpleasant
thick
and
fluffy
feeling
very
drinkable
porter
exceptional
drinkability
is
very
good
as
well
rich
and
smooth
good
flavor
and
5
00
abv
a
worthy
session
beer
overall
very
solid
and
a
nice
treat
in
the
end
d
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
before
wanting
less
sweet
overall
very
nice
indeed
it
does
border
on
being
almost
too
bitter
but
manages
to
maintain
its
integrity
and
balance
for
my
tastes
its
ever
so
slightly
coffeecentric
which
would
make
it
difficult
to
sustain
as
a
session
brew
but
my
single
12
oz
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
nice
but
overall
not
very
memorable
clean
finish
and
very
nice
over
all
this
is
clearly
well
made
but
does
not
stand
out
above
the
rest
from
the
dragon
pack
sampler
the
bottle
pours
a
deep
brown
body
that
is
not
quite
opaque
when
held
to
light
some
spotty
lace
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
has
milk
chocolate
a
hint
of
coffee
earthy
and
fruity
hops
and
a
note
of
molasses
medium
body
and
carbonation
taste
is
mostly
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
with
an
earthy
hop
bitterness
that
balances
well
hints
of
molasses
and
toffee
underneath
just
a
hint
of
dark
roasty
malt
bitterness
a
good
but
not
stellar
porter
following
the
pour
a
very
dark
brown
brew
resides
with
a
thick
head
of
ecru
cream
that
lingered
for
a
few
minutes
before
mostly
abating
a
syrupy
smell
issues
forth
though
enough
roast
comes
through
to
keep
the
nose
from
getting
too
sticky
the
taste
brings
things
back
to
porter
reality
with
more
body
more
roast
with
that
nice
licking
of
molasses
as
heavy
as
it
initially
feels
it
lightens
over
the
course
of
the
drink
leaving
an
impression
of
medium
body
that
allows
for
good
drinkability
i
cant
fully
get
over
the
molasses
thing
its
just
a
little
too
syrupy
which
diminishes
its
pleasantness
to
some
degree
but
all
told
a
very
solid
porter
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
a
solid
english
porter
good
stuff

opaque

goodness
ill
be
looking
into
more
beers
from
st
george
in
the
future
d
goes
down
easily
a
nice
simple
standard
porter
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
while
talking
with
friends
12oz

into
a
starshaped
skim
within
seconds
some
lacing

weak
adhesion
nose

toffee
taste
indicates
cocoa
coffee
and
a
roasted
character
as
well
as
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
between
lightand
mediumbodied
and
effervescent
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
all
and
all
a
decent
and
flavorful
porter
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
mountainous
head
that
left
voluminous
lacing
a
mix
of
sweet
malts
that
are
more
complex
than
me
just
saying
cocoa
or
caramel
or
gum
cotton
candy
or
sugar
w
some
roasted
and
burnt
malts
as
well
mediumbody
very
smooth
and
creamy
as
the
chocolate
and
other
sweet
malts
dance
all
over
the
tongue
but
are
kept
in
check
with
a
drying
sensation
from
the
roasted
and
burnt
malts
finishes
clean
and
dry
a
perfect
counterpoint
to
the
beers
overall
sweetness
a
solid
porter
d
very
drinkable
english
style
porter
i
really
enjoyed
this
very
nice
color
brownish
red
and
dark
just
a
hint
of
hops
for
most
porters
this
beer
was
very
solid
scent
had
just
a
slight
yeast
smell
and
the
taste
was
good
more
malty
than
hops
a
very
good
solid
beer
and
great
to
have
a
drink
with
the
buds
would
buy
again
big
ups
to
ba
erikthered
for
a
pretty
sweet
bonus
brew
pint
at
taphouse
on
queensway
hampton
va
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
porter
light
enough
to
enjoy
in
hot
weather
and
heavy
enough
for
cold
weather
sipping
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
one
of
those
increasingly
rare
beers
in
this
world
of
viscous
baltic
porters
and
russian
imperial
stouts
a
light
refreshing
dark
session
beer
two
fingers
of
moca
colored
head
top
this
very
dark
porter
i
can
see
some
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
first
sniff
is
dominated
by
chocolate
and
molassas
i
also
get
some
toasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
fruityness
taste
is
pretty
much
as
advertised
in
the
nose
dark
bitter
chocolate
flavor
is
the
mainstay
but
there
is
a
noce
almost
citrus
like
hop
flavor
and
a
little
bitter
finish
it
was
just
a
hair
thin
for
my
liking
but
i
prefer
very
thick
porters
i
will
probably
pick
up
a
6pack
of
this
wonderful
porter
next
time
i
see
it
st
george
brewing
company
seems
to
be
more
geared
toward
making
english
style
ales
this
particular
beer
being
an
english
porter
i
like
it
its
malty
without
trying
to
reinvent
the
style
with
dry
hopping
slightly
complex
with
some
good
cocoa
flavors
very
enjoyable
recommended
pretty
drinkable
for
a
porter
great
brew
this
is
easily
my
favorite
st
george
brew
and
one
of
my
favorite
porters
definitely
worth
a
try
notes
really
nice
stuff
quite
mild
and
sessionable
12oz
bottle
courtesy
of
dyan
thanks
i
have
never
even
heard
of
this
brewery
but
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
nice
coffeelatte
colored
head
the
smell
was
my
favorite
part
roasted
chocolate
malted
the
flavor
deviates
slightly
from
the
aroma
but
is
still
in
solid
porter
territory
easy
to
drink
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
t
m
d
roast
malts
a
nice
and
modest
coffee
chocolate
profile
a
dash
of
hops
for
balance
just
right
for
the
style
this
is
a
particularly
clean
and
smooth
porter
refreshing
flavourful
clean
and
smooth
this
was
very
nice
during
a
tasting
and
even
better
from
a
full
bottle
to
get
the
total
experience
quite
nice
and
a
recommended
try
overall
very
good
without
being
to
cloying
or
rich
brought
a
6er
back
from
vb
and
happy
i
did
so
d
very
nice
porter
with
definite
chocolate
character
a
good
session
beer
d
a
wonderful
porter
especially
if
you
like
them
on
the
sweeter
side
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
for
porter
lovers
as
a
bonus
its
great
for
grilling
burgers
as
well
whenever
ive
been
able
to
get
a
hold
of
this
i
saturate
about
2
lbs
of
ground
beef
in
9
oz
or
so
of
it
with
a
little
bit
of
worcetershire
and
some
garlic
its
bliss
overall
this
was
one
very
smooth
and
drinkable
porter
d
pretty
good
this
is
easily
an
anytime
porter
which
is
hard
to
find
for
me
usually
i
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
a
porter
but
this
just
sits
so
well
i
could
see
this
being
a
regular
for
me
very
tasty
and
highly
recommended
d
this
was
a
flavorful
beer
that
went
down
smooth
and
easy
i
would
have
to
give
this
one
a
thumbs
up
d
i
could
drink
these
often
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
a
quaffer
at
only
5
yet
full
of
flavor
and
many
tasty
textures
the
ale
is
missing
the
overroasted
chalkiness
that
is
common
in
some
porters
drinkability
a
tasty
porter
worth
a
few
more
i
bought
a
sixtel
direct
from
the
brewery
and
im
going
to
get
another
very
soon
good
all
around
but
just
a
tad
watery
in
the
middle
perhaps
just
a
touch
more
crystal
malt
would
help
boost
the
body
overall
very
good
though
its
always
nice
to
see
a
brewery
sticking
with
old
world
tradition
doing
it
well
and
not
making
everything
extreme
well
done
st
george
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
it
was
last
night
and
id
driven
12
hours
from
nh
to
my
brothers
in
virginia
before
being
welcomed
in
with
this
fine
brew
anyhow
its
got
a
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
the
flavor
comes
across
as
smooth
and
chocolately
along
with
some
notes
of
roasted
barley
theres
a
wonderful
silky
texture
on
the
tongue
i
didnt
pour
it
into
a
glass
so
i
didnt
get
the
full
aroma
or
appearance
but
nothing
about
this
beer
tells
me
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
it
again
id
definitely
recommend
it
very
nice
porter
it
has
an
excellent
dark
coloring
very
deep
and
robust
aroma
it
goes
down
very
smooth
a
very
rich
smooth
mellow
and
chocolatey
flavor
i
would
recommend
trying
this
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
as
well
as
the
sampler
pack
when
i
was
at
the
brewery
one
of
the
more
pleasant
porters
ive
had
in
recent
memory
nice
flavor
with
nice
body
no
complaints
here
and
maybe
the
best
of
the
offerings
from
st
georges
that
ive
been
able
to
try
porter
is
my
first
foray
into
the
world
of
st
george
beer
im
impressed
i
like
the
fact
that
it
favors
the
more
substantial
end
of
the
style
spectrum
all
those
hops
dont
hurt
either
jolly
good
show
i
really
dug
this
one
its
hearty
and
flavourful
but
subdued
at
the
same
time
i
cant
get
st
george
brews
at
my
local
stores
but
the
next
time
i
am
in
delaware
or
maryland
ill
definitely
take
a
look
for
some
more
of
this
stuff
as
well
as
some
of
their
other
brews
recommended
with
ease
pours
a
dark
opaque
black
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
dark
malts
the
taste
is
of
dark
malts
with
some
bitter
dark
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
almost
like
a
milk
stout
minus
the
roastiness
this
would
make
for
an
excellent
winter
session
beer
but
is
also
enjoyable
on
a
hot
spring
night
likely
the
best
beer
st
george
makes
pours
almost
black
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
poured
it
vigorously
to
try
and
get
a
head
but
didnt
work
smell
was
roasted
malts
and
lots
of
chocolate
taste
followed
smell
with
the
chocolate
flaovrs
very
much
at
the
front
and
the
roastedburnt
malt
flavor
being
very
subtle
a
lightbodied
brew
but
very
smooth
and
rich
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
brews
ive
had
a
good
tasty
session
brew
worth
seeking
out
serving
type
bottle
drinks
pretty
easy
a
real
straightforward
english
porter
this
is
one
tasty
and
well
balanced
english
porter
i
think
i
will
try
to
get
his
into
the
regular
rotation
porter
fans
shoud
seek
out
one
of
these
solid
cordovan
tinged
brown
steady
and
short
walnut
hull
cap
that
leaves
a
single
ringlet
of
lace
after
it
eventually
vanished
rich
chocolate
molasses
light
smoky
coffee
and
gentle
english
hop
aromas
waft
enticingly
from
the
glass
opening
with
some
chocolatey
malt
and
a
soft
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
slightly
chalky
and
english
hop
accented
fuggles
perhaps
there
is
a
pleasing
roasted
note
that
also
comes
up
in
the
finish
the
soft
hops
infuse
themselves
into
the
roasted
chocolate
body
there
is
also
just
a
touch
of
complimentary
sour
fruitiness
mediumlight
body
with
fine
carbonation
this
finishes
on
the
dry
side
a
nice
representation
of
an
english
porter
and
a
good
session
beer
pours
with
a
four
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
hints
of
deep
mahogany

light

basically
it
has
the
richness
and
flavor
of
a
stout
but
the
smoothness
of
a
porter
the
assertive
burnt
bitterness
isnt
too
astringent
and
the
malt
sweetness
isnt
to
overbearing
and
to
top
it
off
they
blend
well
together
i
can
see
why
everyone
has
had
good
things
to
say
about
this
porter
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
a
porter
but
still
smooth
and
silky
doesnt
quite
feel
just
as
warm
as
it
should
but
this
does
help
the
drinkability
all
in
all
not
a
bad
offering
and
a
solid
englishstyle
porter
id
definitely
recommend
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
if
i
could
get
them
down
the
street
thanks
phisig137
for
sending
this
my
way
d
a
good
porter
but
a
tad
thin
the
trickery
of
the
aroma
to
taste
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
offering
though
overall
im
not
a
big
fan
of
porters
but
i
like
this
one
a
lot
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
deep
mahoganey
brew
with
a
large
foamy
head
the
head
stays
with
the
beer
only
dissipating
after
about
five
minutes
the
beer
is
not
transparent
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
barley
coffee
and
nutty
the
taste
is
quite
good
you
can
sense
once
the
toasted
barley
the
hint
of
hops
almonds
or
some
other
kind
of
nuts
and
an
astrigent
taste
of
coffee
the
body
is
medium
and
the
coating
of
the
mouth
leaves
a
sticky
film
it
is
a
quite
quaffable
brew
but
unfortunately
with
most
porters
i
cant
take
much
of
the
astringent
flavor
if
you
like
porters
this
is
a
must
d
best
beer
from
the
dragon
pack
one
of
the
top
porters
ive
had
in
this
young
season
overall
very
enjoyable
because
of
the
lower
abv
d
very
drinkable
well
worth
a
six
pack
a
really
great
porter
that
i
would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
favoring
the
darker
heavier
deeper
end
of
the
beer
spectrum
feels
like
a
big
beer
without
having
a
big
abv
d
yummy

this

was
really

than
i
expected
from
the

of
beers
that
looked
like
it
came
out

its
hit

the
porter
is
definitely

i
did

overall
a
really
nice
porter
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
it
is
well
balanced
everyone
should
be
lucky
enough
to
get
to
have
this
porter
drinkability
an
excellent
porter
and
another
winner
from
st
george
im
not
a
porter
session
drinker
but
if
you
are
you
should
definitely
try
this
as
its
complex
enough
not
to
be
overbearing
but
always
remains
interesting
and
is
fairly
low
in
alcohol
drinkability
excellent
drinkability
this
is
a
good
porter
poured
into
an
imperial

brown
brew

highlights

me
of

taste
is

close
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
not
only
nice
but
the
abv
lets
you
revisit
and
revisit
this
definitely
one
i
could
make
a
regular
if
i
could
find
it
locally
addendum
from
jasons
review
faint
blackberry
i
did
a
resniff
yep
i
smell
it
too
this
beer
is
readily
available
at
most
upscale
grocery
stores
in
the
carolinas
and
for
less
than
7
a
sixpack
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
good
everyday
porter
12
oz
with
no
freshness
date
served
chilled
in
a
nonic
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
1
inch
tan
head
that
leaves
a
few
rings
of
lace
smells
of
roastedburnt
malts
coffee
chocolate
some
sweetness
and
dark
fruits
and
some
sort
of
earthy
notes
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
burnt
malts
but
theres
also
coffee
bitter
chocolate
and
hops
and
a
sweetness
akin
to
an
oatmeal
stout
the
body
is
medium
and
coats
the
mouth
nicely
and
it
is
a
fairly
drinkable
porter
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
perhaps
overall
not
perfect
and
the
first
couple
of
sips
were
a
little
tough
but
overall
a
drinkable
porter
with
some
interesting
flavors
visited
st
george
today
and
had
this
beer
on
tapnice
color
not
much
a
head
smooth
with
a
nice
body
some
porters
can
be
over
the
topand
to
memuch
closer
to
a
stout
this
porter
is
not
one
of
those
as
i
review
this
beer
i
am
having
a
bottleand
i
struck
by
its
drinkability
as
other
reviewers
notethe
balance
is
very
good
i
believe
the
first
beer
i
ever
reviewed
was
the
last
time
i
tried
a
st
george
ipa
i
believe
this
one
may
have
been
cask
conditioned
at
the
world
beer
festival
but
i
wasnt
sure
about
this
great
example
of
a
good
but
not
fantastic
porter
balanced
with
robust
flavors
of
chocolate
and
caramel
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
more
of
in
the
future
i
think
this
one
is
found
around
here
but
since
i
didnt
enjoy
my
first
st
georges
i
never
took
this
one
into
consideration
will
probably
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
soon
overall
this
beer
really
goes
through
some
changes
from
start
to
finish
aromas
and
mouthfeel
definitely
are
affected
as
the
brew
warms
flavors
remain
pretty
much
constant
can
be
a
session
porter
or
a
sipping
porter
crisp
at
the
start
and
smooth
at
the
finish
roasted
tones
last
long
into
the
finish
this
is
a
big
bold
and
flavorful
porter
great
drinkability
and
this
is
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
in
the
future
d
lighter
in
alcohol
than
most
very
flavorful
put
those
two
together
and
you
get
a
very
drinkable
brew
this
beer
on
a
medium
pour
produced
a
nice
one
finger
head
that
lasted
for
about
a
minute
or
so
before
dissipating
into
a
ring
and
island
the
lace
clung
nicely
all
over
the
glass
as
if
fearing
for
its
life
it
had
a
nice
burnt
brown
look
with
deep
ruby
undertones
the
nose
was
deep
bodied
smelling
of
freshly
roasted
coffee
and
a
nice
cherry
dark
berry
hint
only
upon
taste
do
you
find
the
nice
dark
chocolate
over
fresh
coffee
taste
the
roasted
malt
dominating
and
a
very
slight
fruitiness
that
fights
off
any
hop
taste
at
the
end
you
have
the
tiniest
taste
of
hops
that
just
slightly
sours
your
mouth
but
quickly
fades
away
begging
you
to
come
back
to
it
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
to
medium
yet
creamy
smooth
and
crisp
i
would
prefer
it
just
a
bit
heavier
on
the
mouth
and
just
a
bit
less
carbonation
though
the
nice
smooth
aftertaste
lends
quite
well
to
the
drinkability
and
i
would
easily
be
able
to
have
it
as
a
session
beer
or
even
just
with
dinner
this
is
a
great
example
of
american
porter
that
balances
complexity
with
drinkability
its
easily
right
up
there
with
your
anchor
and
sierra
nevada
porters
just
had
a
pint
at
county
ale
house
and
it
was
as
good
or
better
than
the
bottled
version
ebony
sticky
lace
coffee
chocolate
toasted
malts
in
the
nose
and
taste
just
an
all
around
excellent
and
quaffable
brew
one
of
my
favorite
virginia
beers
if
you
make
a
drive
down
the
i95
corridor
then
this
is
one
to
pick
up
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
i
would
drink
this
all
day
anytime
beer
entered
the
glass
as
a
depp
brown
almost
opaque
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
that
fell
to
a
slight
ring
smell
is
a
tantalizing
mixture
of
chocolate
roasted
grains
and
an
exuberance
of
coffee
very
nice
taste
is
roated
coffee
with
a
background
bitterness
mouthfeel
slowly
grows
to
tangy
dryness
that
continues
to
improve
as
you
delay
the
next
sip
a
very
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
pours
to
what
i
would
call
a
extremely
dark
brown
color
hedging
on
black
with
an
adequate
dark
tan
head
that
broke
down
somewhat
quickly
but
left
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
through
out
the
aromas
that
i
notice
first
are
roastedburnt
malts
that
seem
to
lead
to
an
earthiness
smell
mixed
with
a
sweet
like
scent
i
am
also
able
to
pick
up
some
chocolate
like
aromas
mixed
with
a
nutty
scent
over
all
this
is
a
very
pleasant
smelling
brew
has
a
pronounced
roasted
malt
flavor
that
highlights
coffee
along
with
chocolate
tastes
finishes
with
a
slight
sweet
flavor
that
seems
like
it
would
be
expected
based
on
the
overall
flavors
of
the
brew
hard
to
pick
up
hops
but
am
able
to
notice
a
slight
bitter
taste
but
it
is
far
in
the
background
over
all
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
very
happy
to
uncover
it
while
in
north
carolina
will
have
to
look
for
this
one
when
i
get
home
overall
comments
good
to
the
last
drop
very
interesting
for
a
porter
to
have
these
fruitlike
qualities
but
that
seems
to
be
the
trend
in
many
east
coast
porters
ive
had
maybe
thats
the
way
they
were
intended
to
be
once
upon
a
time
wish
i
could
get
this
stuff
around
here

kick
before
leading

likes

drinkability
a
boring
porter
imo
no
character
wont
try
again
this
beer
pours
a
dark
but
not
quite
opaque
brown
with
a
medium
thin
beige
head
thin
and
quick
lacing
the
aroma
consists
of
roasted
coffee
milk
chocolate
and
malt
mediumbodied
with
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
malt
coffee
and
hops
in
the
flavor
and
there
was
a
nice
underlying
roasted
malt
aftertaste
throughout
the
glass
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
hops
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
porter
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
edmund
fitzgerald
or
fullers
but
solid
all
around
its
extremely
deep
chestnut
body
appears
almost
black
on
the
bar
and
it
reveals
brilliant
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
the
creamy
tan
head
drops
slowly
to
a
wide
collar
and
it
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
throughout
most
of
the
glass
the
nose
displays
deeply
kilned
malts
with
a
roasted
edge
and
a
deeply
caramelized
almost
burntsugar
side
as
well
as
some
rich
nuttiness
that
includes
pistachio
the
body
is
medium
and
its
gently
crisp
across
the
palate
with
a
fine
moderate
carbonation
that
softens
as
it
warms
the
flavor
is
slightly
richer
than
the
aroma
indicates
but
the
character
remains
the
same
with
the
addition
of
a
solid
bitterness
that
takes
the
whole
thing
just
a
little
bit
further
a
faint
fruitiness
appears
upfront
coattailed
by
a
rich
nuttiness
thats
immediately
jumped
on
by
bitterness
think
peanut
skins
the
caramelized
sugars
become
apparent
as
it
warms
caramel
molasses
burnt
sugar
and
its
coffeelike
roastiness
develops
towards
the
finish
dark
caramelized
sugars
nuts
a
touch
of
bakers
chocolate
and
bitterness
linger
in
the
aftertaste
quite
rich
and
enjoyable
but
without
being
heavy
or
cloying
certainly
worth
trying
thanks
to
drews
for
the
sample
good
foamy
tan
head
on
top
of
a
clear
dark
brown
beer
with
garnet
highlights
around
the
edges
head
has
good
retention
and
a
little
stickiness
that
holds
onto
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
lots
of
roasted
caramel
malts
and
chocolate
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
start
is
smooth
with
a
slight
sweetness
lots
of
roasted
malts
then
pick
up
with
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
the
background
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
sweet
with
a
hint
of
smoke
flavor
some
slight
bit
of
sweet
malt
comes
back
again
in
the
aftertaste
not
much
hop
bitterness
to
this
brew
the
hops
seem
to
be
tied
together
with
the
roastedburnt
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
make
for
a
nicely
balance
brew
carbonation
is
somewhat
low
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
definitely
a
good
porter
but
there
are
others
that
ive
enjoyed
more
ill
certainly
buy
this
again
at
some
point
especially
since
its
a
very
local
brew
but
probably
wont
stock
my
fridge
with
it
cheers
beer
pours
very
dark
for
a
porter
this
beer
is
comparable
to
the
colore
of
perkunos
from
heavyweight
and
after
a
slow
steady
pour
about
an
inch
of
tan
creamy
head
forms
on
top
of
the
body
trickled
lacing
kicks
this
beer
up
another
notch
on
the
food
chain
and
the
aroma
this
beer
has
to
offer
is
full
of
milk
chocolate
coffe
tones
created
from
the
dark
roasts
used
in
this
brew
this
is
just
a
textbook
porter
one
that
i
would
love
to
attempt
to
brew
at
home
because
the
taste
is
just
heavenly
light
carbonation
carries
this
rich
robust
porter
with
silky
chocolate
tones
and
a
espresso
finish
this
beer
may
be
one
of
the
better
porters
i
have
tasted
for
all
around
drinkability
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
in
a
heart
beat
medium
body
not
heavy
just
incredibly
drinkable
a
go
to
brew
wish
i
lived
near
the
brewery
so
i
could
frequent
this
beer
and
even
have
a
sample
on
tap
pours
a
very
dark
brownish
ruby
color
with
a
short
tan
head
that
fades
into
a
tight
lace
nose
is
sweet
and
chocolaty
and
is
quite
reminiscent
of
chocolate
covered
raisins
medium
to
full
in
body
and
smooth
and
creamy
in
texture
taste
starts
of
with
notes
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
followed
by
a
dry
and
earthy
nuttiness
that
gives
way
to
notes
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
espresso
this
is
one
fine
porter
that
id
happily
recommend
to
anyone
thanks
to
loki
for
the
sample
very
good
porter
and
a
great
price
an
overall
great
line
so
far
gotta
thank
the
shit
for
bringing
me
one
from
his
trip
out
east
im
so
lucky
that
the
saint
george
brewery
is
just
a
hop
skip
and
a
jump
down
the
road
from
me
this
beer
is
always
readily
available
this
exceptional
brew
pours
a
dark
midnight
black
color
with
a
tan
medium
sized
rocky
head
the
froth
fades
away
slowly
leaving
a
sticky
lace
splattered
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
rich
with
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
with
slightly
nutty
undertones
this
is
an
extremely
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
note
this
was
the
old
porter
prob
23
years
old
brewed
at
the
old
brewery
label
states
b
a
brewmeister
inc
before
it
burned
down
label
shows
st

much
cooler
than
the
new
label
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
color
which
give
way
to
a
light
brown
head
the
head
turns
to
a
film
and
lasted
the
whole
ride
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
molasses
is
your
first
introduction
to
this
porter
taste
is
very
very
good
malt
with
a
touch
of
earthy
tones
coffee
maybe
some
chocolate
a
very
easy
porter
to
drink
i
recommend
this
one
to
all
cheers
to
murph
for
picking
this
one
out
and
lugging
it
to
florida
pours
black
with
dark
ruby
hues
poking
through
rocky
head
with
clinging
lace
there
are
coffee
notes
all
over
this
brew
starbucks
not
dunkin
donuts
fruity
esters
fight
their
way
out
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
good
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
a
good
porter
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
nor
do
i
drink
a
bunch
of
cups
of
coffee
at
a
time
either
one
of
the
blackest
porters
i
have
ever
seen
pours
super
black
with
a
nice
brownish
head
and
decent
clinging
lace
very
nice
roasted
flavors
combine
with
a
nice
smooth
bittersweet
chocolate
flavor
to
make
this
a
very
interesting
aroma
taste
starts
off
with
some
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
before
going
very
chocolatey
bitter
roasted
coffee
then
comes
back
to
combat
the
chocolate
sweetness
and
balnce
the
brew
the
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
make
it
exceedingly
drinkable
as
well
as
one
of
my
favorite
porters
to
date
m
a
bit
creamy
but
a
bit
of
a
bite
too
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
small
head

is
of
malts
some
hints
of
coffee
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
medium
bodies
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
a
fairly
standard
porter
much
better
on
nitro
though
drinkable
but
the
syrupy
feel
may
prove
to
be
a
bit
much
after
23
of
these
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
that
i
will
be
buying
again
drinkability
a
solid
porter
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
a
couple
of
these
in
most
settings
i
had
this
beer
on
cask
at
the
redhook
brewery
in
woodinville
wa
and
it
was
pretty
good
they
had
2
available
on
cask
the
blackhook
and
winterhook
the
blackhook
when
i
had
it
was
just
put
available
on
cask
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
am
not
usually
a
porter
drinker
however
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
wasnt
too
thick
or
too
much
on
the
flavor
which
i
liked
it
was
a
very
smooth
enjoyable
beer
i
think
for
people
who
are
like
me
and
dont
normally
enjoy
the
darker
porterstouts
this
one
is
definitely
a
good
one
to
have
the
head
on
the
beer
was
perfect
and
the
color
was
beautiful
it
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
friend
who
is
a
mug
club
member
there
definitely
a
good
beer
overall
one
of
the
top
5
best
porters
i
have
had
for
sure
and
i
would
absolutely
recommend
someone
trying
this
d
went
great
with
the
roast
beef
sandwich
i
had
for
dinner
i
could
see
plowing
through
a
six
of
this
pretty
easy
all
in
all
nothing
spectalular
but
decent
i
would
say
barely
a
porter
though
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
pour
with
a
short
offwhite
headmedium
carbonation
aroma
of
coffeerasins
and
light
chocolate
with
hints
of
roast
flavor
is
roastywith
some
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
coffee
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
thin
body
with
a
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
very
sessionable
i
find
this
to
be
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
redhook
but
as
porter
goes
its
nothing
i
would
deem
as
special
watery
and
thinner
than
expected
mouthfeel
it
helps
in
the
drinkability
as
surprisingly
i
think
this
would
pair
well
with
food
this
is
so
far
from
what
i
would
call
porter
that
id
actually
consider
drinking
this
with
a
pizza
and
thus
the
higher
drinkability
mark
i
was
gifted
a
6
of
this
stuff
and
would
never
buy
this
for
myself
not
horrible
but
im
not
seeking
this
out
again
i
had
the
beer
from
draught
a
nice
black
color
with
a
thick
head
initially
the
beer
had
a
sour
taste
but
after
several
sips
the
sour
taste
faded
im
not
sure
what
the
source
of
the
sour
taste
was
the
aftertaste
was
nice
and
roasty
and
there
was
a
light
creaminess
from
the
nitro
drinkability
easy
drinking
but
nothing
big
wasnt
that
bad
of
a
beer
but
nothing
to
crave
about
workable
but
otherwise
too
ordinary
for
words
drinkability
its
a
nice
rich
porternot
an
imperial
and
as
such
i
was
impressed
i
would
drink
it
again
and
i
think
the
taste
grew
on
me
more
as
i
finished
a
six
pack
over
a
few
nights
poured
a
light
black
with
a
small
tannish
head
nose
is
roasty
with
some
espresso
cocoa
and
toasted
malts
taste
is
average
kind
of
toasted
with
light
hints
of
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
a
drinlable
porter
in
my
book
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
dquite
high
really
nice
flavor
and
very
smooth
id
love
to
drink
this
one
more
often
dvery
drinkable
very
impressed
by
redhook
this
is
a
simple
porter
that
i
could
session
not
bad
at
all
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
i
rarely
am
not
happy
with
porters
but
this
one
just
got
it
wrong
its
not
drainpour
but
i
wont
be
getting
anymore

poured
from

at

into

this
dark
beauty
shows
a
very
deep
coffee
color
with
rose
touches
at
the
edges
a
guinnesslike
tan
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
to
boot
the
aroma
is
a
mild
coffee
malt
with
a
vague
hint
of
citrus
the
first
taste
is
a
silky
and
clean
but
mild
charcoal
some
coffee
bean
and
vanilla
a
bit
more
like
a
stout
by
my
way
of
thinking
but
a
pleasant
pint
either
way
quite
drinkable
not
very
strong
in
any
one
respect
but
there
is
enough
coffee
bitterness
to
keep
it
interesting
i
dont
pick
up
much
on
the
advertized
chocolate
side
of
this
brew
but
no
matter
a
very
nice
feel
creamy
very
worthwhile
on
tap
i
had
this
on
tap
at
gas
light
co
in
portsmouth
right
next
door
to
the
portsmouth
brewing
co
the
beer
has
all
the
makings
of
a
dry
irish
stout
it
is
inky
black
has
a
very
smooth
creamy
off
white
tannish
head
it
doesnt
have
the
efforvescence
of
a
guinness
but
it
does
have
the
nose
that
points
to
chocolatey
roasted
and
dry
malts
the
taste
is
unfortunate
it
doesnt
have
the
nice
hoppy
balance
of
a
porter
and
it
is
really
lacking
the
character
of
an
irish
dry
stout
it
is
dry
slightly
bitter
but
not
nearly
creamy
enough
and
just
lacking
an
hibernian
character
this
beer
really
isnt
all
that
good
and
really
doesnt
do
justice
to
the
american
porter
label
either

chewy
side
enjoyable
would
not
mind
having
a
couple
in
a
sitting
sixpack
may
be
a
little
much
it
is
on
the
heavy
side
d
this
beer
was
fine
but
its
not
all
that
inspiring
im
not
dying
for
more
overall
im
not
sure
id
want
more
of
these
its
not
bad
its
just
not
flavorful
enough
not
enough
to
balance
out
the
burnt
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
too
weak
not
special
but
good
appearance
is
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
tan
frothy
tan
head
aroma
is
faint
but
i
detect
dark
bitter
chocolate
and
some
smoke
taste
is
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
with
restrained
hop
flavor
but
moderate
hop
bitterness
interesting
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
american
porter
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
overall
a
decent
beer
almost
seemed
like
a
stout
to
me
with
its
flavors
but
then
porters
are
probably
close
enough
this
was
a
downer
and
not
a
very
good
porter
so
many
better
versions
existarcadias
london
porter
anchor
porter
edmund
fitzgerald
bells
porter
sam
adams
honey
porter
bully
and
more
just
off
the
top
of
my
head
id
pass
on
this
overall
i
wouldnt
purchase
again
but
was
surprised
by
this
one
not
the
same
version
of
a
porter
i
would
expect
and
definately
hoppy
in
a
good
way
this
porter
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
although
it
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again
overall
im
disappointed
although
ive
only
rated
2
redhook
beers
so
far
my
memory
of
their
other
beers
had
me
expecting
more
hopefully
thinsg
pick
up
a
bit
with
their
other
ones
ill
keep
trying
them
for
now
but
im
definitely
done
with
the
porter
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
this
one
is
a
little
long
in
the
tooth
but
not
enough
to
completely
tank
the
flavor
i
suspect
d
unexciting
but
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
the
body
light
to
make
this
easily
consumable
tastes
minty
blackberry
and
woody
english
hops
so
i
guess
that
would
be
northern
brewer
over
strong
choclate
malt
over
nutty
with
mild
roasty
character
the
roast
is
borderline
scorched
and
not
particularly
pleasant
drying
finish
partly
due
to
carbonation
cleaning
the
palette
aromatic
grassy
hop
character
rises
up
the
back
of
the
throat
not
terribly
complex
but
is
drinkable
md
body
with
some
silky
carbonation
is
too
strong
for
my
preference
of
the
style
overall
dont
bother
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
burnt
malt
with
a
touch
of
cream
and
chocolate
the
taste
has
the
nice
burnt
malt
character
of
the
aroma
but
is
much
more
mellow
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
porter
at
best
it
is
weak
in
both
flavor
and
aroma
but
what
it
has
is
pleasant
i
dont
think
i
will
drink
this
again
notes
this
beer
is
average
at
best
not
something
i
would
try
again
d
definitely
drinkable
indeed
it
goes
down
very
easily
overall
i
ended
up
rating
this
just
above
average
in
all
categories
that
is
because
it
is
pleasant
and
it
is
at
least
more
distinctive
than
a
large
portion
of
the
beers
out
there
but
in
the
end
it
is
not
much
better
than
average
d
this
is
a
decent
porter
and
would
make
a
good
session
porter
but
its
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
came
out
looking
very
good
in
a
pnt
glass
a
nice
dark
color
that
still
allowed
a
bit
of
light
to
come
through
pretty
good
head
although
not
much
lacing
it
had
a
nice
coffee
scent
that
accented
the
burnt
malts
nice
flavor
a
good
deep
porter
with
really
nice
coffee
bursts
goes
down
pretty
well
and
is
easy
to
finish
ive
also
had
this
in
a
bottle
before
and
it
was
quite
good
that
way
too
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
no
noticeable
head
or
apparent
lace
smell
was
very
muted
lightly
spice
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
feel
was
flat
not
enough
carbonation
for
me
on
this
one
had
a
weird
taste
caramel
and
coffee
mixed
with
a
wet
capet
like
aftertaste
overall
it
is
easily
forgettable
and
nothing
i
will
have
a
try
at
again
i
can
assure
of
that
d
this
really
didnt
impress
me
it
tasted
okay
but
it
was
kind
of
weak
upon
first
sip
there
was
a
very
bitter
hoppy
taste
piney
flavored
this
is
not
a
porter
that
ive
ever
experienced
before
this
is
a
porter
for
the
drain
of
my
sink
what
a
big
disappoint
i
a
surprised
that
redhook
even
put
this
swill
on
the
market
this
is
the
worst
porter
that
ive
ever
tasted
why
not
call
this
an
ipa
porter
this
is
the
way
to
experience
this
beer
the
nitrogen
enhances
the
experience
immeasurably
if
you
find
yourself
in
a
location
that
serves
blackhook
on
a
nitrotap
i
suggest
trying
it
regardless
of
your
previous
experiences
with
this
beer
poured
black
with
creamy
head
that
it
retained
until
the
end
nice
lacing
on
glass
but
little
aroma
very
smooth
with
the
proper
amount
of
carbonation
il
liked
it
a
lot
tasted
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
good
but
possibly
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
porter
very
drinkable
pours
black
with
crimson
and
scarlet
tones
solid
creamy
light
tan
head
retains
a
bit
lightmedium
lacing
aroma
is
molasses
caramel
coffee
and
toasted
nuts
mouthfeel
is
silky
dry
and
mediumbodied
flavor
is
smooth
lightly
sweet
malts
followed
by
rich
roast
walnut
almond
and
a
hint
of
grassy
sourness
taste
on
the
whole
is
somewhat
mild
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
with
butter
round
out
the
finish
aftertaste
is
sweet
a
touch
sour
and
dry
not
horrible
but
i
cant
imagine
choosing
this
porter
over
the
countless
others
that
have
much
more
flavor
this
has
never
been
one
of
the
exceptional
beers
in
redhooks
lineup
im
not
sure
why
they
keep
this
around
and
have
let
the
excellend
double
stout
disappear
from
the
market
pours
black
with
minutely
brown
highlights
at
the
edges
with
a
light
collar
of
head
the
nose
is
full
of
charred
malt
notes
its
relatively
uncomplex
just
some
touches
of
chocolate
malt
besides
the
charred
roasted
malt
notes
on
the
palate
its
excessively
astringent
and
bitter
from
the
malts
with
flat
somewhat
metallic
ending
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
watery
with
poorly
integrated
malts
overall
this
is
disappointing
its
certainly
not
terrible
but
theres
really
no
reason
to
seek
it
out
either
blackhook
porter
was
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
light

the
head
was
quite
large
and
had
decent
retention

left
some
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
dark
malt
the
taste
was
dark
toasted

with
dry

it
was
just
less
than

was

for

pleasing

easy

and
enjoyable
a
very
good

love
to
drink
this
beer
again
give
this
one
a
try
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
that
stuck
around
a
bit
smell
of
sweet
smoked
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
has
roasted
malts
for
sure
with
burned
sugarchocolate
and
a
bitterness
that
sticks
around
a
bit
a
little
light
in
the
mouthfeel
for
my
tastes
in
a
porter
this
beer
poured
a
black
color
with
a
red
tint

decent
head
that
didnt
stick
around
long
the
smell
is
quite
sour
the
taste
is
malty
and
roasted
with
some
bitterness
it
has
some
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
heavy
this
is
a
fairly
smooth
beer
and
because
it
isnt
heavy
lends
itself
to
being
fairly
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
rather
thin
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
not
a
porter
id
sit
down
and
love
to
enjoy
all
the
time
but
this
isnt
too
bad
i
like
mine
with
more
vigor
however
though
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
porter
this
winter
season
this
isnt
a
bad
one
to
choose
in
my
opinion
i
had
an
english
pint
of
blackhook
porter
drawn
from
cask
at
redhooks
forecasters
pub
the
beer
is
an
opaque
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
light
tan
compact
head
but
as
with
the
other
beers
served
here
the
porter
is
served
fairly
cold
and
its
difficult
to
pick
up
on
the
mild
chocolate
aromas
these
appear
later
as
the
beer
begins
to
warm
the
head
forms
a
nice
lace
as
it
retreats
and
my
first
mouthful
is
tremendously
smooth
this
medium
bodied
low
carbonated
beer
is
quite
a
noticeable
improvement
over
the
version
served
on
tap
the
taste
is
rich
roasted
malt
with
coffee
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
tones
it
is
nicely
balanced
however
and
has
a
moderately
bitter
but
pleasant
finish
if
this
were
kept
on
cask
all
year
long
this
might
be
the
only
beer
id
drink
from
redhook
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
even
somewhat
blackish
formed
a
nice
1
12
inch
that
left
it
mark
on
glass
as
it
receded
has
a
great
smell
picking
up
some
black
or
chocolate
malt
doesnt
have
much
body
or
mouthfeel
to
it
quite
thin
for
a
beer
of
this
style
has
toasted
notes
leaves
you
with
a
kind
of
burnt
taste
all
in
all
a
good
brew
just
expecting
more
body
from
this
style
a
really
nice
find
in
a
little
convienence
store
in
north
carolina
i
just
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
few
more
6
packs
of
this
outstanding
porter
pours
a
nearly
pitch
black
color
with
some
dark
chocolatey
brown
notes
the
head
is
minimal
taste
is
robustly
nutty
and
malty
but
still
on
the
mild
side
for
a
porter
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
one
of
the
more
simpler
easier
porters
without
comprimising
any
wonderful
flavor
im
sure
ill
be
getting
this
again
sometime
this
would
be
a
good
crossover
beer
due
to
the
inoffensive
flavor
profile
however
the
lack
of
full
flavor
makes
this
a
poor
representation
of
a
porter
the
pour
into
my
fullers
nonic
raises
a
tan
one
finger
head
over
a
superdark
brown
glass
that
lets
pass
just
a
little
ruby
light
at
the
edges
lacing
is
pretty
nice
although
the
head
falls
low
quickly
nose
smells
of
light
roast
a
bit
of
creamed
coffee
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
roasted
and
acidic
sweet
in
the
beginning
with
a
clean
finish
the
roast
and
sweetness
mingle
nicely
together
not
much
depth
but
quite
tasty
mouth
is
on
the
thicker
side
with
tingly
but
fine
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
porter
and
a
nice
intro
to
redhook
had
this
on
tap
at
andys
tonight
poors
out
a
super
dark
brown
but
with
a
slightly
reddish
hue
to
the
edge
of
it
not
as
dark
as
the
normal
porter
creamy
cappucino
like
head
smelled
of
slightly
roaste
coffee
tiny
bit
of
hops
not
much
else
wehres
my
embers
wheres
the
chocolate
i
dunno
the
taste
closely
mimmicks
the
nose
a
bit
of
coffee
thats
about
it
slight
hops
bringing
up
the
rear
finishes
incredibly
clean
but
not
surprising
considering
there
wasnt
much
in
the
body
to
begin
with
this
beer
is
very
delightful
on
cask
at
the
forectasters
pub
at
the
brewery
it
is
very
dark
nearly
black
with
a
creamy
light
tan
very
foamy
head
the
head
retains
nicely
and
leave
big
lace
around
the
glass
it
has
toasty
scarcely
mocha
smells
but
theres
not
much
in
the
nose
the
first
thing
about
the
cask
conditioned
version
is
the
terrifically
creamy
mouthfeel
it
is
a
superbly
rounded
smooth
substantial
beer
with
the
hops
coming
on
slowly
behind
the
darkly
roasted
malted
barley
tastes
which
are
coffee
grainy
and
tangy
the
hops
are
unfortunately
nondescript
and
seem
to
be
doing
more
bittering
than
flavoring
the
finish
is
medium
length
and
i
think
a
more
distinctive
hop
profile
would
go
a
long
way
toward
fixing
this
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
and
on
the
lowside
of
the
56
abv
mark
so
nearly
a
session
beer
i
think
the
casked
version
is
much
more
drinkable
than
the
other
manifestations
of
this
beer
very
redhookish
some
good
flavors
but
typically
undermalted
leaving
the
brew
a
bit
bland
weak
aromas
of
roasted
grain
toast
and
caramel
tastes
similarly
with
a
bitterness
that
more
results
from
the
roasted
character
than
from
hops
the
malts
fall
away
quickly
leaving
the
beer
watery
and
characterless
it
wouldnt
take
much
to
make
this
beer
a
quality
brew
add
more
malts
to
bring
the
beers
gravity
up
to
par
with
other
good
porters
a
bit
more
of
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
wouldnt
hurt
either
im
still
waiting
on
redhook
to
surprise
me
with
a
great
brew
i
think
they
are
capable
of
it
this
is
a
fine
sessionable
example
of
an
american
porter
this
would
probably
be
an
allright
beer
to
give
to
someone
whos
never
had
a
porter
before
very
mild
in
flavor
but
if
youve
had
some
of
the
better
porters
out
there
id
give
this
a
pass
this
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
theres
a
very
likable
quality
in
that
also
this
beer
is
easily
accessible
however
id
love
to
have
a
more
complex
flavor
in
my
porters
not
to
bad
taste
a
little
to
burnt
to
drink
a
lot
of
though
this
beer
seems
closer
to
porter
than
some
of
redhooks
other
beers
are
to
their
model
styles
solid
work
and
quite
drinkable
easy
drinking
middle
of
the
road
porter
blackhook
is
simpler
than
many
porters
and
makes
a
fine
starter
for
someone
unfamilliar
with
the
style
also
it
could
be
me
but
the
east
coast
version
seems
to
be
milder
while
the
west
coast
version
comes
across
as
hoppier
i
dunno
anyway
its
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
can
split
a
six
of
this
with
the
redhook
esb
they
compliment
each
other
nicely
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
spot
on
not
too
much
not
too
little
very
easy
drinking
surprisingly
dated
on
the
bottle
as

not

still
a

a
good

nothing
great
but
a
good
drinking
beer
this
is
a
good
session
ale
bottle
label

cheers
black
hook
porter
is
a
refreshing
break
from
the
six
pack
of
blonds
a
day
world
and
worth
another
look
overall
a
decent
and
inexpensive
porter
not
the
best
by
a
stretch
but
definitely
worth
a
try
drinks
really
easy
if
youre
pick
about
style
guideline
you
would
pobaly
still
rate
this
a
good
brew
such
as
i
almost
did
i
remember
the
late
90s
early
00s
version
truer
to
the
style
overall
this
beer
beer
is
a
good
thirst
quencher
perhaps
it
fits
the
porter
guidelines
of
the
original
macro
style
pours
a
solid
brown
color
with
ruby
hues
at
the
bottom
clarity
is
very
good
and
a
half
finger
head
falls
to
a
very
light
film
over
top
of
the
beer
this
one
could
stand
to
be
a
touch
darker
for
my
taste
nose
is
light
with
roasted
malt
with
tones
of
nuttyness
and
caramel
with
a
mild
american
hop
tinge
on
the
end
flavor
is
quite
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
it
starts
moderately
nutty
and
caramel
sweet
moving
to
a
pretty
light
roast
and
finishing
with
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
that
hangs
on
into
the
finish
there
is
not
a
lot
in
this
one
that
lets
me
know
it
is
an
american
porter
the
flavors
are
all
fairly
weak
with
the
roasted
character
being
almost
an
afterthough
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
brown
ale
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
not
what
i
expect
in
an
american
porter
the
flavors
are
not
strong
or
bold
enough
the
feel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
and
its
just
not
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
ill
pass
on
this
one
again
love
dark
brews
saw
this
in
walmart
tonight
and
since
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
gourmet
beer
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
color
was
a
clear
brown
with
a
nice
light
caramel
head
that
held
and
gave
a
nice
feel
on
the
palate
could
smell
chocolate
and
roasted
aromas
also
noticed
some
hints
of
fruit
taste
was
light
for
a
dark
beer
not
as
thick
as
expected
could
taste
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
something
like
roasted
pecans
went
down
smoothly
slightly
creamy
and
left
just
enough
bite
at
the
finish
would
go
great
with
a
steak
or
grilled
portabello
not
my
favorite
beer
but
i
would
buy
again
overall
i
would
consider
ordering
this
again
matching
it
up
to
my
dining
choice
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
sharp
hops
and
buried
beneath
that
is
a
smattering
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
dark
brown
with
a
smattering
of
head
that
mimics
sea
grass
spread
on
a
calm
ocean
initial
sip
has
a
bit
of
lager
bite
and
thinness
some
muted
malts
and
very
little
roast
asspect
it
is
more
in
keeping
with
the
older
english
style
porters
than
the
newer
roastier
american
style
porters
i
favor
its
just
not
very
satisfying
it
feels
lagery
light
to
medium
body
mouthfeel
a
little
watery
nice
carbonation
pretty
good
overall
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
the
sixer
i
bought
overall
i
think
this
particular
bottle
is
past
its
prime
for
only
being
about
3
months
old
this
beer
has
a
fuller
flavor
and
fuller
mouthfeel
than
this
one
bottle
suggests
normally
i
like
it
just
not
this
one
bottle
note
the
label
and
bottle
have
changed
since
the
beer
pic
was
taken
brittle
all
in
all
and
rather
unsatisfying
pennies
not
so
drinkable
but
passable
in
certain
situations
i
suppose
pours
a
cocacola
hue
with
a
nice
chocolatetan
head
that
quicly
dissiaptes
smells
promising
coffee
bitterness
sweet
chocolate
and
some
bready
yeasts
somewhat
muted
though
taste
is
faithful
to
the
nose
very
satisfying
porter
if
a
bit
watery
and
mild
definitely
a
nice
every
day
beer
wish
i
could
get
them
around
these
parts
poured
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
slightly
offwhite
head
fell
to
an
attractive
coating
smell
is
somewhat
sweetish
with
only
slight
roasted
malt
noted
taste
is
also
on
the
swwetish
side
with
a
midertae
hoopy
botterness
and
a
slight
medicinal
taste
finish
is
more
dry
tahn
malty
and
very
attractive
a
bit
less
than
your
average
porter
drinkability
was
dying
of
thirst
so
at
the
time
this
was
a
5
for
drinkability
but
ordinarily
this
would
still
be
a
tasty
drinkable
beer
almost
has
a
cola
like
flavor
pours
a
reddish
brown
coffee
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
didnt
stick
this
time
ill
have
to
try
another
one
later
with
a
more
vigorous
pours
smells
of
roasted
notes
and
slight
hints
of
coffee
burnt
nutty
aroma
and
a
chocolate
sweetness
is
also
present
i
detect
noble
hops
also
taste
is
malty
and
nutty
with
bits
of
coffee
and
chocolate
medium
body
with
an
earthy
tone
and
there
is
something
about
this
that
makes
it
chewy
aftertaste
is
a
roasted
or
burnt
coffee
taste
backed
up
with
those
earthy
tones
again
solid
porter
in
my
mind
and
it
is
only
lacking
that
head
maybe
next
time
im
the
kind
of
guy
that
likes
that
in
a
beer
every
once
in
while
i
like
a
manly
shitbeer
thing
sometimes
it
just
has
to
be
real
beer
without
all
the
added
crapola
anyway
the
mouth
feel
was
a
tad
waterier
than
i
expected
but
it
wasnt
much
of
a
turn
off
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
to
me
definitely
a
step
above
your
good
basic
beer
cheers
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
smallish
white
head
the
smell
is
very
faint
and
i
could
make
out
only
a
small
roated
malt
aroma
the
taste
has
a
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
little
bit
of
coffeebut
its
nothing
great
by
all
means
the
mf
is
too
light
for
this
type
of
beerbut
it
is
pretty
well
balanced
this
is
pretty
much
an
average
porternothing
specialnothing
great
i
wouldnt
turn
one
downbut
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
either
overall
this
beer
has
a
nicely
balanced
taste
my
first
redhook
brew
in
a
while
but
not
a
bad
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
beaut
especially
the
huge
fluffy
head
it
had
awesome
retention
and
lasted
the
whole
drink
the
smell
was
quite
malty
with
chocolate
some
subtle
spices
and
roasted
malts
evident
taste
similar
but
it
also
had
elements
of
lights
hops
in
the
finish
all
in
all
a
good
brew
that
didnt
disappoint
one
of
the
better
american
porters
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
its
rich
and
roasty
and
very
drinkable
would
make
a
fantastic
session
beer
highly
recommended
drinkability
i
session
the
absolute
hell
out
of
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
people
have
their
goto
beers
that
they
like
when
they
dont
want
something
complicated
this
beer
is
mine
how
sad
one
of
the
main
reasons
i
bought
this
redhook
sampler
case
was
because
they
dont
sell
this
beer
in
six
packs
around
here
oh
well
at
least
it
was
pretty
cheap
blackhook
was
a
delicious
example
of
a
dark
porter
the
pour
was
a
dark
roasted
color
that
produced
an
offtan
head
however
the
head
dissipated
fast
the
smell
had
a
distinct
roasted
character
with
a
slight
undertone
of
sourness
and
chocolate
there
was
not
any
detectable
hop
nose
which
makes
me
think
this
was
not
an
american
porter
style
the
taste
was
mellow
with
an
even
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
the
smooth
feel
of
this
beer
caused
me
to
take
the
time
to
savor
the
first
sip
and
got
many
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
the
most
prevalent
flavors
are
that
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
malt
overall
a
great
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
pours
a
nice
dark
ruby
and
holds
a
good
sized
slowly
receding
tan
head
has
a
slightly
burnt
roasty
smell
and
taste
and
is
lighter
bodied
than
other
porters
ive
sampled
although
those
were
of
the
baltic
style
not
much
carbonation
finished
smooth
and
proved
to
be
for
me
a
nice
dinner
beer
that
doesnt
take
over
the
meal
a
drinkable
porter
although
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
sweet
stout
ive
heard
it
has
a
whole
different
flavor
from
the
bottle
so
ill
shall
have
to
compare
and
contrast
in
the
future
nothing
wowing
here
but
a
solid
brew
probably
my
favorite
from
the
redhook
line
now
that
double
black
stout
has
bit
the
dust
appearance
is
a
burnt
mahogany
that
allows
a
little
light
to
peek
through
coffee
colored
foam
that
leaves
sticky
lace
aroma
is
a
nice
starbucks
latte
with
hazelnuts
and
cocoa
initial
taste
brings
in
the
roasted
grains
malt
dark
chocolate
and
hops
mouth
feel
is
good
carbonation
medium
body
dextrin
and
malt
remain
sweet
to
the
end
and
the
other
flavors
waft
away

leaving
a
clean
palate
ready
for
food
andor
dessert
pretty
lightbodied
and
easy
to
drink
pleasant
enjoyable
but
not
outstanding
i
probably
wont
bother
seeking
it
out
again
but
it
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer3
or
6
would
not
hurt
a
man
redhook
is
one
of
the
rare
micros
that
can
be
found
in
wv
we
all
know
the
story
so
i
tried
to
be
openminded
when
i
sat
down
and
had
this
and
just
like
the
esb
its
a
very
nice
beer
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
that
is
kept
in
check
by
a
decent
hop
bitterness
while
the
nitrogen
ruined
it
a
little
bit
it
wasnt
quite
as
bad
as
one
might
think
and
i
hope
to
give
this
beer
a
try
in
the
bottle
or
on
co2
and
compare
had
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
very
dark
brown
when
served
came
topped
with
12
of
thick
tan
head
some
metallic
notes
in
the
aroma
it
would
have
been
nice
to
try
this
as
a
regularnonnitro
offering
as
mouthfeel
wise
it
came
across
as
watery
mostly
low
malt
with
a
roasty
finish
again
i
think
the
beer
would
have
come
off
better
served
nonnitro
i
loved
winterhook
but
my
second
hook
falls
woefully
short
of
what
i
would
consider
to
be
good
beer
in
fact
im
fairly
certain
that
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
wouldnt
even
identify
blackhook
as
a
porter
at
all
although
there
are
too
many
major
faults
for
it
to
be
salvageable
cranking
up
the
malt
content
would
be
a
good
place
to
start

pours
a
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
smell
of
coffee
and
chocolate
roasted
malts
are
prevalent
weak
taste
of
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
with
very
little
hop
bite
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
disapointed
too
thin
for
a
porter
in
my
opinion
overall
impression
yet
another
solid
offering
from
red
hook
its
very
simple
balanced
flavorful
and
quaffable
just
like
everything
else
they
brew
sort
of
like
if
your
grandmother
brewed
beer
instead
of
baking
cookies
drinkability
despite
my
complaints
about
the
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
its
a
nice
crossover
beer
into
the
style
and
it
goes
down
nicely
with
just
enough
taste
to
satisfy
once
again
redhook
has
made
a
very
decent
brew
its
definitely
worth
giving
a
shot
this
is
very
drinkable
porter
indeed
makes
a
great
session
beer
i
do
wish
that
the
body
was
a
little
thicker
but
i
like
this
beer
either
way
pours

pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
roasted
grains
and
chocolate
mostly
but
fairly
weak
the
flavor
is
comprised
of
the
coffeeroasted
malts
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
seems
like
it
could
have
a
bit
more
body
but
its
a
good
beer
this
beer
is
lighter
in
color
and
flavor
than
almost
any
other
porter
i
have
tried
that
might
not
be
such
a
bad
thing
except
that
there
were
other
flaws
to
this
beer
nose
is
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
and
maybe
some
alcohol
the
taste
begins
with
that
roasted
chocolatecoffee
combo
but
its
rather
weak
roasted
barley
comes
and
goes
very
quickly
body
is
thin
and
hurts
the
flavors
potential
the
finish
really
got
me
though
it
was
buttery
and
had
an
alcohol
kick
really
weird
and
something
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
seems
to
be
really
mainstreamed
and
maybe
there
were
some
problems
with
the
yeast
as
well
not
something
id
go
back
to
thick
body
on
this
one
with
the
familiar
nitro
smoothness
somewhat
drinkable
but
tone
down
the
butter
and
i
very
rarely
complain
of
butteriness
but
this
one
was
egregious
pours
out
to
a
dark
brown
to
black
in
the
glass
with
a
slight
head
aroma
is
that
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
the
taste
is
straightforward
malt
with
a
hints
of
expresso
and
chocolate

light
this
would
be
a
good
session

especially
in
the
midtaste
occational
metallic
taste
creeps
in
rather
thin
mouthfeel
for
the
style
easydrinking
and
generally
satisfying
but
it
didnt
get
me
very
excited
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
so
many
other
great
porters
out
there
to
choose
from
ok
for
someone
getting
into
beer
or
in
a
pinch
but
not
something
i
would
choose
to
drink
again
on

for
a
6er
at

in
albuquerque
the
carbonation
is
better
and
the

retention
is
better
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
colalike
and
there
is
alot
of
opening
green
hop
bite
and
finishes
with
lots
of
burnt
black
patent
definitely
a
westcoast
version
of
a
porter
overall
its
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
but
not
something
i
would
care
to
drink
very
often
black
looking

red

coming
threw
taste
is
light
burnt
flavors
and
coffee
with
a
burst
of
carbonation
with
light
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
has
flavors
like
a
good
porter
but
not
as
strong
more
like
a
watered
down
version
of
a
good
porter
mouthfeel
is
also
a
little
weak
and
light
for
a
porter
drinkability
well
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
so
its
drinkable
but
lacking
the
good
flavors
and
body
i
was
use
too
would
not
buy
this
again
unless
only
other
choice
was
macro
swill
when
i
heard
that
red
hook
was
partially
owned
by
a
macro
company
i
had
my
doubts
as
to
how
good
their
beer
could
be
i
ended
up
really
enjoying
blackhook
porter
and
am
now
eager
to
try
the
rest
of
their
lineup
appearance
is
dark
coffee
colored
head
is
fairly
short
and
light
brown
smell
isnt
very
strong
mainly
roasted
malts
are
detected
with
a
slight
whiff
of
hops
taste
is
complex
and
balanced
roasted
malts
are
the
strongest
component
of
blackhooks
flavor
coffee
flavor
is
noted
hops
balance
blackhook
out
nicely
and
make
a
tasty
note
midway
through
a
sip
sip
ends
with
more
roasted
malts
and
a
little
more
sweetness
than
before
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
blackhook
and
look
foward
to
trying
their
esb
soon
wow
was
i
suprised
by
this
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
tan
mocha
head
that
is
great
to
look
at
lacing
coated
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
coffee
beans
and
milk
chocolate
a
marshmellow
cream
is
detected
a
slight
hint
of
roasted
barley
the
taste
is
chewy
and
satisfying
up
front
is
a
nice
coffee
roasted
grain
taste
and
slight
cream
aftertones
a
hint
of
hop
brings
up
the
rear
medium
bodied
and
suprisingly
good
will
drink
again
huge
head
lots
of
stick
lacing
on
the
way
down
body
is
translucent
brown
in
color
the
scent
is
very
mellow
with
hints
of
raisins
and
coffee
beans
tastes
like
a
combination
of
a
stout
and
a
pale
ale
body
was
too
thin
has
the
flaws
of
most
other
rh
beers
this
pours
out
a
nice
deep
black
body
with
a
tall
light
brown
head
minimal
lacing
is
left
after
the
head
dies
down
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
strong
espresso
presence
otherwise
i
found
the
nose
to
be
relatively
mild
but
pleasant
taste
was
of
roasted
coffee
with
a
bit
of
smokiness
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruits
it
had
a
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
as
well
mouthfeel
was
good
with
nothing
standing
out
except
a
bit
of
over
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
as
the
taste
was
pleasant
enough
that
i
would
definitely
have
one
of
these
again
pretty
solid
example
of
a
porter
not
the
best
but
good
poured
out
a
dark
and
rootbeery
deep
brownblack
there
was
a
quick
rising
head
that
quickly
reduced
down
to
a
tiny
amount
with
mainly
just
a
khaki
ring
around
the
edge
a
cloud
in
the
center
of
the
stubby
pilsner
glass
cant
see
through
it
god
great
aroma
could
smell
it
while
pouring
the
scents
just
shot
over
to
me
but
for
all
that
i
could
smell
the
taste
was
not
as
intense
as
i
was
hoping
for
alot
of
carbination
bit
of
a
disappointment
there
too
much
for
my
tastes
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
soda
passed
to
a
friend
to
try
asked
what
he
thought
about
the
carb
he
said
that
he
drinks
soda
through
the
day
and
that
it
was
just
fine
for
a
sodalike
carbination
tastes
of
burnt
toast
and
black
coffee
funny
side
note
a
friends
father
who
had
swung
by
the
bar
happened
to
grab
the
bottle
to
try
what
was
unpoured
grabbed
a
swig
and
said
that
it
tasted
as
though
it
had
gone
flat
i
found
that
odd
since
i
was
so
put
off
by
the
high
carb
i
tried
the
bottle
and
noticed
that
when
you
drink
from
the
bottle
you
really
do
get
a
whole
diffrerent
mouthfeel
overall
though
a
porter
worth
a
try
poured
a
deep
and
clear
mahogany
brown
color
with
tinges
of
ruby
coming
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
thin
tan
head
with
touches
of
redness
covered
the
beer
the
aroma
is
dark
and
rich
with
licorice
and
molasses
sweet
dark
chocolates
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
rich
roasty
and
flavorful
with
some
bittersweet
chocolates
coming
through
towards
the
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
and
overall
a
pretty
nice
porter
this
is
really
quite
drinkable
oddly
the
tap
handle
and
point
of
sales
never
use
the
word
porter
deep
dark
mahoganyruby
black
color
thin
cocoa
brown
head
appears
for
a
bit
before
fading
to
a
thin
collar
and

strings
aroma
has
a
slight
burnt
malt
character
to
it
with
some
singed
sweet
caramel
and
even
brisker
coffeeness
underneath
taste
has
a
bit
of
crispness
to
it
yet
yields
a
smoothness
thats
enjoyable
where
it
lacks
in

it
has
some
levels
of
interest
blackened
malts
a
bit
earthy
kinda
burnt
mild
sweetness
from
some
caramel
and
vanilla
cream
a
bit
astringent
and
chalky
in
the
finish
where
slight
coffee
subdues
but
fades
out
quickly
feel
is
close
to
medium
smooth
over
all
with
a
crisp
edge
at
first
when
cold
which
is
periodically
left
behind
in
some
sips
not
as
bold
or
as
rich
as
it
could
be
seems
to
lack
behind
more
like
its
teasing
you
into
thinking
it
could
be
good
go
on
take
another
sip
hmmm
nope
still
the
same
oh
well
perhaps
one
of
the
better
offerings
by
redhook
what
a
drinkable
beer
this
beer
has
a
very
attractive
appearance
good
flavor
although
in
fairness
its
probably
not
bold
enough
to
be
a
great
porter
and
a
smooth
aftertaste
i
dont
detect
any
offensive
aftertastes
and
the
level
of
sweetness
seems
just
right
to
me
it
does
taste
a
bit
watery
at
the
very
end
but
for
my
money
that
contributes
to
the
drinkability
if
not
to
the
mouthfeel
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
certainly
buy
it
again
a
very
nice
tasting
brew
that
has
its
flavors
go
right
along
with
its
aromas
a
nice
coffeecappuccino
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
over
all
a
real
nice
porter
one
that
i
would
get
again
definitely
a
nice
porter
enjoyed
with
some
chocolates
very
nice
pairing
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
light
brown
inch
tall
head
formed
on
a
dark
mahogany
nearly
opaque
brew
large
bubbles
lead
of
heavy
lacing
bonus
heavy
malty
aroma
and
a
taste
dominated
by
the
dark
malts
yet
not
overly
bitter
which
makes
for
smooth
drinking
a
easy
drinking
smooth
quaff
seems
to
be
what
the
porters
of
old
were
made
to
be
sampled
a
bottle
with
a
date
of
123003
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
small
tannish
head
developed
and
quickly
faded
after
a
few
minutes
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
behind
on
the
glass
the
appearance
is
very
dark
like
a
robust
porter
a
chocolate
coffee
aroma
dominates
the
senses
first
hand
no
hop
aroma
at
all
first
thoughts
are
something
is
not
quite
right
some
kind
of
rancid
foul
taste
that
is
hard
to
describe
it
also
has
a
metallic
aftertaste
too
mouthfeel
is
thin
i
would
like
a
thicker
mouthfeel
after
this
first
glass
i
dont
think
i
will
be
asking
for
another
too
bad
i
have
to
finish
off
5
more
bottles
bottled
on
date
of
121003this
one
poured
black
with
a
dark

head

and

in

some

chocolate
notes

dry
chalkyness
and
then
hops
in
the
smooth
finish
decent
porter
very
nice
black
appearance
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
smell
was
malty
and
smoky
but
slightly
off
taste
was
initially
sweet
then
had
a
bitter
quality
that
lingered
light
to
medium
in
body
it
had
a
nice
dry
finish
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
a
definite
ste
up
from
other
red
hook
offerings
i
have
tried
let
me
mention
one
thing
before
i
start
the
few
times
ive
had
a
porter
on
tap
it
is
always
served
chilled
when
i
buy
bottles
from
the
store
i
tend
to
drink
it
at
room
temperature
i
get
more
of
the
flavor
im
told
this
tends
to
be
the
preferred
way
to
drink
a
porter
in
some
regions
i
will
have
to
find
those
areas
when
i
drink
a
dark
beer
on
tap
i
am
all
about
the
pour
generally
blackhook
depending
on
the
skill
of
the
bartender
will
have
a
nice
thick
head
that
does
not
fade
fast
and
has
a
sweet
taste
to
it
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
for
me
is
that
for
a
lot
of
porters
i
find
after
2
or
3
my
taste
buds
are
shot
or
tired
but
blackhook
does
not
tire
out
my
senses
it
may
be
because
it
is
served
cold
but
it
also
does
not
happen
when
i
drink
from
a
bottle
overall
impression
man
i
cant
get
over
that
smell
truly
rancid
i
dont
think
i
can
get
past
the
amount
needed
to
judge
it
again
with
the
taste
being
fairly
clean
i
really
think
i
got
an
ok
bottle
but
i
may
have
to
revisit
this
review
just
to
be
sure
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
since
i
cant
drink
this
one
drinkability
has
to
be
a

a

to

for

all
the
way
from
connecticut
dark
black

foamy

aroma

a
light

medium

porter
malts
are
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
slight
roastyness
hops
are
slightly
spicy
a
little
light
bodied
for
a
porter
the
malt
balance
is
right
but
the
mouthfeel
is
way
too
thin
there
is
a
touch
of
vegetative
flavor
not
unpleasant
but
unexpected
drinkable
but
to
light
in
body
to
be
taken
seriously
as
a
porter
mouthfeel
is
thin
finish
is
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
bad
porter
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
one
was
pretty
good
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
there
was
a
faint
smell
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
nice
a
semi
bitter
yet
semi
sweet
taste
that
went
down

the

chilled
review
edit
to
possibly
come
soon
prost
drinkability
as
graded
a
very
average
porter
many
others
are
better
and
ill
be
having
one
of
those
next
time
fullbodied
with
coffeeish
tinges
but
never
rich
enough
for
me
a
bit
too
thin
i
say
not
a
terrible
porter
but
not
terribly
good
either
notes
one
of
the
most
drinkable
porters
in
the
us
give
me
some
grilled
meat
or
switch
this
beer
up
with
some
chocolates

or
as
a
session
beer
ill
take
it
either
way
tastes
a
bit
malty
with
burnt
malt
undertones
a
bit
thin
and
watery
taste
leaves
the
palette
quickly
medium
bodied
but
not
much
there
weak
flavored
not
bad
certainly
drinkable
but
immensely
boring
a
forgettable
beer
agian
like
the
ipa
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
going
on
grainy
malts
once
again
with
a
slightly
roasted
finish
a
bit
thin
and
boring
no
length
on
the
finish
remeinded
me
of
the
ipa
with
a
slight
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
obviously
darker
in
colour
pretty
tame
porter
cask
gbbf
03
the
aroma
is
of
malt
with
some
smokey
sense
but
not
of
an
impressive
nature
the
flavor
is
a
bit
better
somewaht
committed
to
its
roasted
malt
body
but
again
not
overly
impressive
the
body
is
deninitely
light
and
a
bit
watery
drinkable
enough
it
neither
impresses
nor
offends
and
is
light
enough
of
an
abv
to
last
awhile
update

i
thought
id
rereview
this
with
a
2005
bottle
since
i
havent
had
it
since
september
2003
i
pretty
much
found
the
same
thing
except
that
the
nose
was
a
little
less
inviting
a
drinkable
porter
but
not
a
very
good
one
pretty
much
a
classic
robust
porter
sticking
to
the
style
and
not
really
breaking
any
ground
i
thought
the
nitro
was
interesting
as
theres
not
many
porters
served
this
way
but
it
really
didnt
strike
me
in
any
way
as
special
just
good
on
nitro
tap
at
the
woodinville
wa
brewery
this
was
a
decent
but
tame
porter
deep
black
in
color
with
a
creamy
nitro
head
the
beer
looks
very
nice
in
the
glass
faint
chocolate
and
hop
aroma
rises
from
the
glass
but
these
flavors
are
only
partially
realized
in
the
taste
much
of
the
character
is
stripped
by
the
nitro
but
the
porter
has
a
nice
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
small
sized
tan
head
formed
when
this
beer
was
poured
and
it
had
smallmedium
sized
bubbles
that
quickly
dissipated
the
hue
was
black
and
the
nose
was
malty
the
flavor
was
that
of
coffee
and
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
lightmedium
bodied
this
beer
had
good
lacing
to
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
14
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
patent
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
malts
the
taste
is
good
a
bit
sweet
in
the
beginning
there
is
a
delicate
balance
between
base
and
specialty
grains
this
beer
has
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
too
carbonated
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
that
is
a
great
sessions
beer
a
dark
beer
for
dark
beer
lovers
complex
but
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
for
all
the
porters
that
veer
towards
stouts
here
is
one
that
seems
to
be
a
very
dark
brown
ale
there
are
not
enough
porters
in
the
marketplace
but
there
are
many
better
examples
out
there
i
this
this
along
with
the
double
black
stout
are
the
best
from
redhookthis
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
pretty
creamy
headthe
aroma
is
not
real
strong
a
little
mutedsome
bitter
chocolate
notes
along
with
some
woodiness
the
taste
is
earthy
and
somewhat
nutty
with
a
light
drynesspretty
tasty
pretty
drinkable
for
the
stylecould
be
a
little
fuller
in
aroma
but
not
bad
aroma
is
almost
stout
like
in
its
dark
roasted
quality
and
strong
coffee
overtones
pours
with
virtually
no
head
and
whatever
was
there
leaves
very
quickly
leaving
only
a
small
ring
on
the
outside
almost
black
in
color
with
red
hues
when
held
to
the
light
medium
to
strong
in
burnt
quality
of
dark
raosted
malt
flavor
just
hints
of
fruit
and
at
times
toffee
but
nothering
bold
or
outstanding
bitterness
level
is
on
the
mild
side
other
than
in
the
finish
pleasant
lingering
taste
that
is
mild
and
rather
long
lasting
not
particularly
heavy
maybe
even
bordering
on
the
thin
side
yet
enjoyable
and
lower
in
carbonation
but
with
enough
to
make
it
filling
fairly
tasty
beer
this
porter
poured
a
very
dark
black
with
hints
of
red
if
held
to
the
light
almost
opaque
but
clear
if
held
to
a
light
the
foam
was
tan
and
creamy
and
long
lasting
the
smell
was
sweet
roast
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
roasted
malt
caramel
hints
of
coffee
and
cocoa
some
chicorylike
hop
flavors
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
feel
was
low
there
was
a
nice
malty
aftertaste
this
was
a
very
nice
porter
on
nitrotap
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
low
light
brown
head
that
disappears
too
quickly
aroma
of

a
faint

no

whatsoever
mouthfeel
is
a

watery
carbonation
is
very

not
the
perfect
pint
but
a
very
tasty
very
drinkable
porter
very
dark
and
poured
very
nicely
by
a
barkeep
who
really
knows
what
hes
doing
its
nice
to
be
able
to
try
beers
in
different
ways
it
brings
out
different

the
tones
were
not
as
strong
this

i
think
this
is
a
beer
best
described
as
a
light
porter
as
such
it
is
not
heavy
the
way
porters
can
be
and
is
ideally
suited
to
the
beer
drinker
not
accustomed
to
porter
give
this
to
your
corona
swillin
buddy
to
start
him
off
on
the
road
to
redemption
despite
its
faults
it
like
all
redhook
products
is
drinkable
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
virtually
black
in
color
without
much
of
a
head
the
bit
that
was
there
dissapated
quickly
to
a
thin
film
hearty
roasted
nose
very
malty
with
hints
of
burnt
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
good
very
smooth
low
carbonation
the
taste
however
is
a
little
watery
not
as
full
bodied
as
some
of
my
favorite
porters
have
been
a
little
coffee
cocoa
a
bit
of
hops
not
much
going
on
here
but
still
a
drinkable
porter
that
is
cheap
and
while
not
the
best
it
aint
bad
neither
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
porter
perhaps
a
good
beer
to
introduce
people
to
the
style
less
than
average
head
espeically
for
a
porter
poured
about
a
half
inch
and
reduced
slowly
althoughit
did
leave
a
solid
wall
of
thick
lace
all
the
way
around
it
didnt
impress
me
opaque
black
in
color
a
sweet
hop
aroma
that
wasnt
to
strong
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
watery
and
lacked
somewhat
in
carbonation
roasted
malt
flavors
are
quickly
overshadowed
by
a
long
drawn
out
bitterness
a
very
average
porter
maybe
even
less
than
average
maybe
hints
of
smoke
and
coffee
are
noted
but
to
hard
to
tell
this
is
the
first
mild
dark
beer
i
remember
liking
it
just
goes
down
it
has
a
good
backbone
nice
balance
of
malt
and
coffee
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
grand
yet
easy
easy
yet
nice
hops
this
is
by
no
means
a
fabulous
beer
but
this
is
solid
i
guess
the
malt
hop
and
coffee
flavors
are
all
well
balanced
yet
clearly
perceptible
i
sucked
down
two
bottles
before
i
realized
i
had
not
written
a
word
of
this
review
this
beer
poured
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissapated
quickly
blackhook
seems
to
be
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
and
it
is
also
light
colored
for
a
porter
a
bit
lighter
and
it
would
let
some
light
through
this
makes
it
a
much
more
drinkable
session
beer
than
your
average
porter
this
beer
is
balanced
more
towards
the
bitter
side
but
there
are
also
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
when
i
first
served
this
from
my
fridge
it
seemed
a
bit
tasteless
but
after
the
glass
warmed
up
in
my
hand
the
flavors
really
came
out
this
beer
came
to
the
bar
top
a
dark
brownblack
color
that
had
a
slight
red
hue
on
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
was
full
thick
creamy
and
tan
in
color
and
the
lace
covered
the
side
of
the
glass
in
rims
and
sheets
you
could
tell
how
much
of
a
sip
that
you
just
took
the
smells
that
came
from
this
were
not
many
consisted
of
slight
roasted
malt
a
light
colored
coffee
coffee
that
is
served
in
your
cup
that
is
light
in
color
dt
the
cream
that
was
added
and
floral
hops
the
tastes
that
came
to
me
were
roasted
malts
coffee
cocoa
light
berries
and
fruit
very
light
floral
hops
and
a
slight
yeast
flavor
in
the
middle
this
beer
had
a
slight
bite
in
the
end
and
a
floral
hop
aftertaste
it
left
me
with
a
medium
dry
feeling
in
my
mouth
a
big
thumbs
up
to
the
bar
they
had
the
knowledge
to
serve
this
beer
at
a
warmer
temperature
felt
like
6567
degrees
which
aided
in
the
experience
and
made
it
worth
while
i
think
at
a
colder
temperature
it
would
have
lost
a
lot
this
poured
looked
and
smelled
like
a
pot
of
black
coffee
there
was
no
head
just
a
couple
of
errant
bubbles
the
color
was
pitch
black
without
a
hint
of
light
blackhooks
smell
was
pure
roasted
columbian
coffee
very
deep
and
earthy
it
tasted
chalky
and
dry
with
serious
espresso
and
coffee
notes
with
just
a
little
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
very
interesting
it
was
thin
enough
to
be
a
pale
ale
or
a
bitter
without
any
of
the
thickness
of
a
porter
this
was
a
very
cool
interpretation
of
a
english
porter
i
will
definitely
buy
more
of
this
in
the
future
pours
out
real
dark
with
a
beautiful
head
nice
flavors
in
this
beer
mmmmmm
it
has
some
solid
hops
and
some
solid
malty
goodness
too
feels
great
going
down
wet
and
dry
all
at
once
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
and
have
thank
you
deacon
for
hooking
up
some
brews
down
at
redhook
nothing
special
at
all
in
this
beer
has
a
relatively
attractive
appearance
black
and
thick
but
pours
a
miniscul
head
flavor
is
weak
just
another
porter
type
flavor
though
it
does
have
a
heavy
emphasis
on
sweet
chocolate
other
than
it
is
your
typical
porter
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
brownish
black
minimal
tan
head
nose
is
roasted
grains
some
sweet
cocoa
nose
somewhat
subdued
i
love
the
taste
some
swweet
chocolate
mixed
with
dark
baking
cocoa
smooth
and
creamy
very
drinkable
if
a
bit
thinnish
one
of
my
favorite
every
day
session
porters
a
pleasing
deep
ruby
red
to
almost
brown
color
on
the
pour
with
an
impressive
head
that
dissolves
into
thick
clinging
sheets
of
lace
that
obscures
the
glass
nutty
sweet
nose
with
malt
caramel
also
present
lightly
toasted
or
coffee
aromas
quite
a
sweet
start
almost
too
much
with
the
top
being
skinny
and
the
finish
nicely
hopped
fair
carbonation
dry
aftertaste
and
a
fair
to
middling
porter
nothing
special
for
food
recommendations
a
thick
chargrilled
burger
would
do
well
maybe
with
some
onion
rings
to
bring
out
the
sweet
undertones
of
the
brew
very
dark
could
be
described
as
black
little
head
and
lace
and
very
little
carbonation
almost
no
nose
at
all
just
a
hint
of
dark
roasted
malts
a
nice
pronounced
hoppiness
wafts
up
too
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
no
pronounced
bitterness
from
the
malts
or
hops
just
a
fairly
dry
and
clean
finish
some
dark
chocolate
notes
in
the
flavor
profile
a
hint
of
coffee
too
really
doesnt
seem
like
a
porter
has
more
of
a
roasted
stout
feel
to
it
without
the
bold
bitterness
the
bottle
proclaims
that
it
is
microfiltered
and
you
can
tell
seems
a
bit
thin
in
flavor
too
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
porter
and
would
be
an
appropriate
intro
brew
for
those
just
getting
into
the
world
of
porters
and
stouts
a
good
nightcap
on
a
cold
northern
october
night
the
label
says
this
is
dark
but
not
bitter
well
they
got
that
right
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
color
the
smell
is
relatively
subdued
with
notes
of
maltiness
the
taste
is
of
coffee
roasted
malt
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
hops
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
an
incredibly
easy
drinking
porter
would
make
a
solid
session
beer
if
you
like
em
dark
but
not
bitter
what
the
f
this
is
a
porter
by
every
other
measure
this
is
a
guinness
it
looks
like
one
it
pours
like
one
and
they
sold
it
as
one
the
aroma
was
markedly
different
and
the
taste
was
as
well
sweet
honey
and
coffee
but
a
porter
this
was
pure
cream
and
a
quick
easy
drink
not
bad
but
kind
of
misleading
on
tap
a
great
porter
very
drinkable
and
complex
forward
flavors
enjoy
repeat
cheers
this
beer
is
a
dark
ruby
color
a
thin
brown
head
recedes
to
an
edging
rather
quickly
sweet
caramel
burnt
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
are
all
perceived
on
the
nose
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
creamy
low
carbonation
i
like
the
bitter
aspect
of
this
porter
coming
from
blackened
malts
and
hops
nice
chocolate
taste
as
well
body
is
medium
at
best
a
little
thin
overall
this
is
a
solid
porter
mind
you
as
i
write
this
im
a
hop
head
so
if
my
review
seems
poor
it
is
for
that
very
reason
but
this
beer
is
in
fact
a
drinkable
one
with
its
robust
dark
color
and
full
chocolaty
roasted
flavor
makes
this
a
decent
porter
the
head
showed
up
for
a
bit
but
then
quickly
faded
the
flavor
tends
to
stick
around
in
the
pallet
for
a
bit
to
give
the
mouth
a
pleasent
feeling
after
drinking
this
porter
this
beer
certainly
helps
open
my
mind
to
enjoy
more
thick
beers
similar
to
this
not
bad
for
a
beer
from
a
budweiser
owned
company
pours
with
a
average
creamy
head
and
has
a
deep
dark
look
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
and
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
but
had
a
pretty
good
taste
though
not
up
to
par
with
most
porters
i
have
had
a
very
drinkable
porter
for
the
novice
cheers
minimal
head
and
lacing
nice
coffeelike
aroma
dark
brown
to
nearly
black
in
color
with
a
nice
roasty
chocolate
flavor
not
as
good
as
the
sierra
nevada
porter
but
an
excellent
buy
for
a
couple
of
dollars
less
than
the
sn
enjoyed
on
a
nitrous
tap
poured
black
with
a
nice
white
creamy
head
that
lasted
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
was
very
weak
with
undertones
of
roast
malt
some
bitterness
in
the
flavor
and
mainly
roasted
malt
without
any
kind
of
subtle
complexities
at
all
creamy
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
rather
thin
for
a
robust
porter
i
have
not
sampled
many
different
porters
and
in
fact
bought
this
one
because
i
am
a
fan
of
all
beers
redhook
that
being
said
i
like
blackhook
this
is
a
richlyflavored
beer
that
begins
with
strong
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
and
finishes
with
a
smooth
flourish
of
hops
its
aromas
are
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
former
dominating
its
color
is
quite
pleasing
being
a
deep
red
brown
with
a
caramelcolored
head
this
porter
starts
out
subtly
chocolatey
and
finishes
with
just
a
touch
of
pleasant
hop
tang
i
like
the
finish
more
than
the
initial
taste
nice
color
actually
a
little
darker
than
other
porters
that
i
prefer
on
taste
blackhook
has
always
been
a
consistent
good
choice
to
me
but
not
a
musthave
porter
notes
this
is
one
beautiful
porter
great
blend
of
flavours
to
make
for
a
very
drinkable
ale
it
has
been
brewed
longer
than
you
think
since
1983
a
wonderful
take
on
the
style
with
its
bitterness
o
a
very
interesting
style
and
im
glad
dann
and
ron
brought
it
back
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
hazy
chestnut
highlighted
browntoblack
coloring
with
a
thin
frothy
foamy
offwhite
head
aromas
of
heavy
roasted
coffee
both
bitter
and
a
bit
smoky
flavors
are
very
heavily
roasted
with
a
solid
profile
of
coffee
both
bitter
and
rich
very
heavy
coffee
profile
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
roast
with
a
hint
of
bittersweet
chocolate
note
dry
bitter
midlingering
finish
solid
brew
and
fun
to
see
what
brews
used
to
be
like
back
in
the
day
as
they
say
an
interesting
treat
and
i
dont
mind
drinking
it
one
bit
thanks
to

good
overall
but
for
me
just
a
little
too
bitter
for
a
porter
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
english
porter
normal
chocolate
and
roasted
characteristics
with
a
little
bit
of
a
twist
with
the
hops
easy
to
drink
would
have
it
again
o
really
pleasant
and
unique
my
first
offering
from
pretty
things
as
well
cool
beer
with
a
cool
back
story
a
very
drinkable
and
classic
porter
highly
recommended
it
may
be
my
one
of
my
favorite
porters
o
if
this
is
what
was
drunk
in
the
19th
century
they
had
it
good
and
now
that
most
are
drinking
the
corporate
swill
it
seems
we
are
going
backwards
as
a
human
race
as
far
as
beer
is
concerned
this
is
a
great
beer
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
and
one
that
i
really
enjoy
both
because
of
the
taste
and
as
well
because
of
the
story
and
history
behind
it
unique
and
intriguing
a
great
porter
to
keep
you
warm
on
a
cold
night
o
mouthfeel
aside
this
beer
is
a
winner
over
the
last
2
years
ive
come
to
trust
that
pretty
things
will
deliver
a
quality
brew
and
if
this
beer
is
an
accurate
recreation
as
the
label
suggests
then
them
soldiers
were
drinking
pretty
damn
good
the
feel
is
good
with
plenty
of
deep
roasted
and
mild
bitterness
with
slight
caramel
sweetness
accenting
with
an
almost
creamy
body
and
slightly
dry
finish
without
much
in
the
way
of
alcohol
presence
i
love
the
taste
it
has
woody
and
slight
nutty
grain
which
comes
off
like
a
high
cocoa
content
dark
chocolate
taste
with
subtle
earthy
elements
and
hint
of
hops
giving
balance
but
the
balance
does
seem
to
be
more
dry
than
sweet
and
bitter
with
slight
pine
flavor
and
gentle
dark
sugar
notes
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
a
nice
balanced
porter
which
is
not
heavy
on
the
sweetness
this
is
an
excellent
beer
this
is
remarkably
englishtasting
considering
it
was
brewed
by
pretty
things
this
is
interesting
and
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
o
a
memorable
beer
in
a
style
category
that
is
usually
underwhelming
to
me
im
stoked
i
got
to
try
this
overall
awesome
porter
ill
definitely
go
back
and
buy
another
to
share
with
a
friend
o
one
of
the
best
in
style
that
ive
had
and
a
great
beer
at
that
smooth
mouthfeel
rich
flavors
easy
to
drink
thanks
again
eric
o
fantastic
really
complex
with
lots
of
flavors
leaves
a
great
smoked
flavor
thats
both
intriguing
and
delicious
highly
recommended
d
it
is
an
interesting
opportunity
to
try
a
beer
recreated
from
the
mid
19th
century
i
am
used
to
historical
beers
coming
from
ancient
recipes
and
coming
with
a
rather
loose
interpretation
of
the
original
ahem
dfh
but
this
seems
to
be
quite
authentic
the
dark
character
is
quite
different
from
what
one
typically
gets
in
a
modern
porter
as
this
beer
is
all
about
dark
sugar
rather
than
roasted
grain
overall
very
interesting
and
complex
beer
suspect
for
many
folks
with
a
better
pallette
than
moi
would
appreciate
it
perhaps
w
time
i
would
like
it
more
o
a
quite
enjoyable
and
rather
complex
beer
loads
of
flavor
without
being
overpowering
cloying
or
tiring
very
nice
o
this
one
could
end
up
in
the
drain
i
wanted
to
enjoy
this
one
this
is
hard
to
drink
its
much
like
a
bad
homebrew
what
happened
to
this
brew
if
i
had
to
choose
one
beer
to
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
one
might
just
be
it
overall
damn
fine
take
on
the
style
its
scary
how
well
they
copied
british
water
tons
of
flavor
and
complexity
for
days
this
would
probably
stand
up
to
some
aging
maybe
a
year
pretty

porter
pours
almost
entirely
black
theres
a
little
bit
of
cherry
shining
through
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
thats
it
there
are
about
three
fingers
of
light
caramel
head
sitting
atop
the
beer
retention
is
outstanding
the
heads
creep
down
the
side
of
the
glass
is
a
slow
one
theres
a
solid
ring
of
lace
marking
the
apex
of
the
head
but
below
that
its
little
too
spotty
the
nose
is
predominantly
roasted
coffee
with
solid
support
from
dark
chocolate
aromas
a
nice
herbal
note
lies
far
in
the
background
but
keeps
things
interesting
the
malt
profile
of
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
that
of
the
aroma
with
coffee
being
the
primary
note
chocolate
is
a
little
bit
more
present
here
though
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
melds
into
bitterness
from
the
hops
before
closing
with
a
subdued
herbal
noble
hop
flourish
the
body
is
is
a
serious
letdown
nowhere
near
richfull
enough
and
it
crosses
the
line
into
watery
the
carbonation
is
appropriately
subdued
and
doesnt
overtake
the
lackluster
body
i
enjoyed
this
most
recent
entry
in
the
once
upon
a
time
series
when
it
was
fresh
but
thought
a
little
bit
of
time
would
improve
it
some
i
think
i
was
right
but
held
on
to
this
bottle
a
month
or
two
too
long
still
a
great
brew
overall
its
definitely
hoppier
than
most
porters
especially
english
ones
i
didnt
like
this
one
as
much
as
their
kk
in
the
series

a
solid
porter
with
a
real
pop
the

are
an
enhancing
addition
robust
and
malty
this
is
a
porter
im
happy
with
and
would
buy
again
if
in
the
malty
mood
overall
nice
reminds
me
of
averys
new
world
porter
which
i
am
quite
fond
of
that
beer
was
better
though
i
love
this
beer
ive
been
looking
for
a
porter
like
this
for
a
long
time
its
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
even
though
it
is
not
technically
perfect
im
giving
it
a
5
overall
because
all
the
elements
work
so
well
together
and
the
experience
is
just
so
damn
enjoyable
i
like
it
better
on
the
cold
side
before
the
hop
taste
fully
kicks
in
the
cpj
poured
a
3
mocha
head
deep
burnt
umber
brown
body
smells
nicely
of
hops
caramel
chocolate
taste
is
really
nice
and
smooth
too
emphasizing
cocoa
and
coffee
followed
by
a
hops
boost
to
the
finish
it
all
compliments
each
other
unlike
some
of
the
other
overhopped
dark
beers
popular
right
now
in
which
the
hops
even
overwhelm
the
dark
roast
flavors
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
while
there
can
be
a
slightlytoopowerful
alcohol
tinge
at
the
edges
of
the
brewwhich
is
surprising
since
its
only
6
abvits
most
certainly
a
delicious
porter
that
features
heavily
the
tobacco
flavors
of
the
style
o
i
wish
i
had
this
in
my
immediate
market
year
round
i
loved
the
shit
out
of
this
sweetened
up
as
it
warmed
but
overall
this
was
a
bonfied
bitter
bad
ass
mo
fo
possible
the
most
perfect
porter
ive
ever
had
im
gonna
email
the
brewery
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
clone
recipe
amazing
if
it
werent
so
damn
pricy
id
almost
alway
have
it
on
hand
o
very
good
and
interesting
beer
i
would
actually
prefer
it
to
be
a
bit
less
hoppy
though
the
hops
were
actually
weaker
than
expected
its
not
terribly
bitter
or
anything
but
id
like
to
taste
the
rich
malt
flavors
in
an
even
gentler
brew
still
im
a
fan
of
pretty
things
particularly
these
once
upon
a
time
beers
o
quite
enjoyable
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
not
as
hoppy
as
i
was
expecting
for
once
i
dont
mind
that
at
all
i
prefer
there
to
be
a
slight
break
between
the
darker
ales
and
ipas

acton
ma
this
could
be
outstanding
on
cask
though
it
isnt
bad
in
the
bottle
lacking
the
multiple
layers
of
roast
that
my
favorite
examples
sometimes
exhibit
this
is
a
robust
and
direct
porter
none
the
less
very
enjoyable
once
again
pretty
things
makes
a
very
good
beer
that
defies
categorization
it
definitely
has
aspects
of
a
porter
and
is
probably
closest
to
a
porter
if
it
had
to
be
categorized
but
it
has
aspects
that
fit
in
line
with
stouts
brown
ales
and
even
ipas
in
some
respect
maybe
black
ipas
definitely
a
nice
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
especially
at
a
lower
abv
taste
has
a
more
upfront
hop
aspect
with
a
long
lingering
bitterness
it
isnt
a
harsh
bitterness
because
of
the
roasted
malt
presence
its
actually
like
a
burnt
bitterness
with
a
piney
presence
carbonation
is
right
in
the
range
its
supposed
to
be
and
helps
lends
a
touch
of
creaminess
dont
go
into
this
with
any
preconceived
notions
because
i
think
it
will
end
up
being
vastly
different
than
you
imagine
but
its
a
very
nice
brew
and
im
honored
to
have
tried
a
bit
of
beer
history
dark
brown
liquid
that
was
only
barely
translucent
huge
head
of
tan
foam
on
the
top
that
settled
down
only
briefly
to
coat
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
a
thick
spider
like
web
of
lace
dark
roasted
malts
are
all
over
the
aroma
notes
of
molasses
cocoa
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
light
touches
of
everything
from
licorice
to
dark
fruits
as
it
warmed
it
got
a
touch
one
sided
as
some
elements
of
peat
started
to
break
the
surface
but
taken
the
first
sip
all
was
forgotten
just
huge
rich
notes
of
chocolate
malts
and
a
touch
of
licorice
just
come
across
the
tongue
in
waves
of
flavor
rich
and
very
sweet
hints
of
molasses
and
roasted
coffee
now
come
across
the
tongue
very
well
put
together
taste
starts
deep
and
worty
roasted
chocolate
in
the
middle
and
finds
the
anise
and
some
burnt
coffee
coming
on
at
the
close
with
a
lingering
alcohol
tinge
to
keep
the
dark
flavors
company
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
good
this
one
retains
its
use
from
even
way
back
then
yum

i
love
the
idea
behind
the
once
upon
a
time
beers
taking
a
look
into
the
past
and
reviving
an
original
recipe
this
is
a
unique
beer
with
rough
charred
edges
and
a
boatload
of
hops
really
great
with

i
get
something
of
a
porterblack

hybrid
from
this
beer
well
worth
your
time
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
d
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
successful
brew
im
curious
as
to
the
actual
historical
accuracy
of
the
recipe
but
its
a
nice
hoppy
porterblack
ipa
hybrid
the
bitterness
gets
a
bit
fatiguing
but
otherwise
the
low
alcohol
and
nice
flavors
make
it
quite
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
chris
for
this
how
in
the
heck
is
this
on
the
buzzed
list
light
brown
with
an
amber
hue
light

a

the
taste
is
not
good
all
roasted
soap
not
worthing
trying
a
semi
opaque
brown
colored
beer
with
a
fine
tan
froth
that
sticks
around
dry
toasty
malt
more
in
the
way
of
bittersweet
chocolate
woodsmoke
and
burnt
molasses
than
dark
fruit
hops
are
dominant
with
a
nice
green
stalk
flavor
fresh
and
bitter
leaving
little
malt
sweetness
on
the
palate
a
little
sting
of
mineralmetal
in
the
finish
which
is
otherwise
all
hops
tight
clean
bitter
my
kind
of
porter
reminds
me
of
several
northwest
beers
i
used
to
enjoy
in
or
odpretty
things
is
just
a
very
solid
brewery
this
may
be
my
favorite
offering
from
them
i
love
their
saisons
and
i
really
loved
american
darling
this
actually
is
on
par
with
the
latter
nothing
pretty
things
makes
is
less
than
a
really
good
time
what
a
big
porter
especially
for
the
abv
had
been
putting
off
trying
this
one
wont
be
doing
that
again
with
this
brewery
o
another
fine
historical
experiment
from
the
folks
at
pretty
things
hopefully
this
isnt
a
oneoff
and
enters
their
regular
rotation
o
this
has
made
me
reconsider
pretty
things
after
having
their
terrible
quad
this
is
a
fine
ale
and
i
can
so
imagine
some
officers
in
an
english
style
pub
swilling
this
down
quite
a
glimpse
into
the
past
notes
this
is
one
great
porter
the
finish
lasts
for
days
and
its
packed
chock
full
of
vibrant
tastes
if
this
is
anything
like
what
the
british
were
drinking
in
the
1800s
they
were
truly
spoiled
the
history
buff
in
me
is
really
loving
pretty
things
dedication
to
these
recreations
too
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
and
ladies
not
really
complex
or
interesting
but
certainly
not
bad
very
very
solid
porter
very
pleased
with
this
one
thought
it
would
be
hoppier
but
a
great
porter
and
the
taste
follows
suit
of
the
nose
rich
and
roasty
and
very
bitter
dark
cocoa
like
tannins
which
i
believe
are
from
the
roasted
malt
and
flavors
of
unroasted
barley
very
pruney
in
the
mouth
with
raisin
and
fig
about
bakers
chocolate
earthy
hops
tobacco
and
leather
semi
sweetness
in
the
way
of
burnt
sugar
and
caramel
is
swiftly
dried
out
in
the
long
chewy
finish
some
red
currant
flavors
and
molasses
rule
the
palate
on
the
finish
and
in
the
middle
possibly
my
favorite
porter
ive
had
but
hard
to
say
so
much
going
on
and
so
complex
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
almost
black
with
very
little
to
no
light
getting
through
the
head
is
tan
and
thick
and
holds
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
rich
roasty
and
hoppy
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
melded
together
with
the
roasted
malt
flavor
followed
by
a
nice
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
overall
a
really
excellent
brew
taste
is
deep
and
earthy
the
roasted
malt
really
stands
out
the
alcohol
seems
to
warm
the
palate
and
intensifies
the
malty
goodness
there
is
a
surprising
hops
bitter
finish
that
fights
through
the
deep
malt
backbone
of
this
beer
its
really
different
and
its
fantastic
overall
im
pretty
impressed
by
this
beer
i
think
this
and
jack
dor
are
my
favorite
pretty
things
beers
and
as
a
porterstout
fan
i
think
this
is
great
if
this
is
the
beer
that
was
popular
in
the
1800s
im
jealous
i
would
pick
this
up
as
soon
as
you
can
cheers
o
goes
down
easily
very
tasty
not
filling
mild
kick
great
representation
of
style
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
porters
yet
another
solid
offering
from
pretty
things
o
this
is
an
excellent
porter
and
definitely
an
interesting
piece
of
history
at
the
same
time
i
like
porters
but
i
find
that
most
are
a
bit
too
smoky
a
characteristic
that
isnt
overpowering
in
this
brew
the
hoppiness
is
quite
intriguing
its
kinda
like
an
american
black
aleblack
ipa
but
with
extra
roast
and
chocolate
and
coffee
overall
delightfully
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
a
little
above
average
overall
it
was
a
very
flavorful
and
good
beer
the
hoppiness
meshed
pretty
well
with
the
roasty
chocolaty
flavors
which
is
sometimes
hard
to
pull
off
a
pretty
nice
beer
overall
editing
10
minutes
later
the
hops
really
come
out
after
its
qarmed
up
a
bit
nice
hop
bite
that
doesnt
take
over
the
porter
flavor
stuffs
fantastic
light
carbonation
i
could
have
gone
for
more
and
i
almost
wish
i
hadnt
shared
it
at
a
game
great
stuff
overall
a
fabulous
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
over
and
over
once
again
the
pretty
things
beer
ale
project
has
produced
one
of
the
better
beers
in
new
england
wow
these
old
school
british
folk
knew
their
way
around
an
aggressive
pint
of
beer
and
this
stuff
is
aggressive
by
todays
standards
i
wish
england
was
still
making
beers
like
these
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
because
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
roasted
flavors
and
bitterness
a
very
good
beer
dark
in
color
with
a
slight
tinge
of
blood
red
the
brownish
head
slowly
wisps
away
like
a
ghost
the
aroma
of
this
beer
hints
at
licorice
and
roasted
malts
a
slight
creaminess
gives
way
to
a
slight
bitterness
with
hints
of
burnt
coffee
roasted
malts
and
anise
had
it
at
sapsuckers
in
huntington
new
york
on
tap
at
the
new
porter
cafe
in
west
roxbury
served
in
a
harpoon
ipa
glass
dirty
brown
colored
body
thin
white
head
chalky
powdery
cocoa
smell
taste
was
impressive
though
i
found
it
unique
to
try
a
hoppy
porter
the
chocolate
malt
was
there
for
the
porter
aspect
but
there
was
definitely
a
nice
dose
of
hops
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
confusing
though
not
thick
enough
for
a
porter
but
heavy
for
an
ipa
doesnt
hide
the
alcohol
though
as
i
thought
it
was
way
above
6
this
is
an
interesting
beer
from
pretty
things
i
am
not
sure
that
i
fell
in
love
but
i
certainly
am
always
impressed
when
i
try
a
new
pt
beer
more
porter
than
ipa
but
the
hop
presence
is
distinct
the
body
is
surprisingly
thin
the
finish
is
cocoa
with
a
bitter
kick
quite
appealing
o
this
is
not
a
novelty
beer
this
is
a
tasty
and
well
constructed
very
hoppy
porter
if
this
were
regularly
available
i
would
probably
buy
it
as
frequently
as
the
smuttynose
and
founders
porters
however
one
bomber
is
certainly
enough
for
a
sitting
overall
good
brew
if
you
cant
decide
between
and
ipa
and
a
lighter
stout
or
a
black
ale
then
this
would
be
the
1
choice
this
certainly
delivers
the
goods
for
any
porter
lover
which
i
am
the
hoppiness
isnt
off
the
charts
but
it
does
present
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
norm
i
would
have
loved
it
if
the
roasted
char
had
been
dialed
back
just
a
bit
very
dark
brown
with
dark
chestnut
edges
and
a
dense
tan
cap
good
head
retention
and
solid
sheets
of
lace
clung
to
the
glass
interesting
aroma
an
odd
combination
of
hops
and
malt
toasted
malts
and
burnt
sugar
pine
resin
with
a
bit
of
sharp
citrus
mild
roast
and
a
hint
of
fruitiness
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
as
it
warmed
similar
flavour
profile
with
plenty
of
resinous
bitterness
chocolate
and
roast
toasted
bread
and
milder
contributions
from
fruity
citrus
and
caramelized
sugar
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
little
chalky
and
slightly
astringent
i
have
to
admit
that
this
beer
was
a
bit
confusing
to
me
at
first
but
as
i
worked
through
it
i
kept
finding
new
layers
of
flavours
as
it
warmed
i
ended
up
liking
it
quite
a
bit
overall
a
fascinating
beer
and
thanks
to
the
folks
at
pretty
things
for
bringing
this
historical
artifact
back
to
the
present
this
is
an
amazing
wondrous
thing
i
have
a
feeling
that
if
i
had
access
to
this
beer
i
would
buy
as
much
of
it
as
i
could
every
chance
i
got
to
keep
it
around
for
as
long
as
i
possibly
could
from
the
initial
aroma
through
to
the
feeling
at
the
back
of
the
throat
every
sense
and
emotion
that
is
evoked
by
this
liquid
is
pleasant
and
most
of
them
blow
me
away
with
happy
goodness
this
would
be
in
my
daily
rotation
if
it
could
be
without
question
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
nice
and
balanced
and
blend
together
nicely
the
hops
are
a
nice
addition
to
traditional
porter
style
overall
very
enjoyable
it
had
more
going
that
i
thought
it
would
i
expected
a
more
straight
porter
but
characteristics
of
exciting
brown
ales
and
even
belgian
style
ales
are
found
here
when
i
went
to
review
this
beer
i
noticed
that
there
is
more
than
one
instance
of
the
word
fine
in
other
peoples
reviews
indeed
pretty
things
makes
the
kind
of
beer
that
inspires
people
to
use
words
like
fine
when
talking
about
the
craftsmanship
eip
is
yet
another
example
of
this
a
very
bold
porter
6abv
outstanding
flavor
though
a
bit
too
bitter
very
much
worth
the
purchase
the
folks
at
pretty
things
are
experts
at
brewing
ancient
obscure
styles
and
they
concocted
another
interesting
creation
here
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
for
nothing
more
than
posterity
d
a
very
enjoyable
brew
from
pretty
things
and
i
love
the
idea
that
i
am
drinking
a
recreated
beer
definitely
the
best
one
from
the
series
thus
far
overall
excellent
porter
when
consumed
fresh
another
good
brew
from
pretty
things
d
not
quite
a
beer
id
expect
to
me
enjoying
in
the
middle
of
may
but
with
all
the
rain
and
heavy
air
this
beer
suits
it
perfectly
a
fantastic
porter
that
turns
refreshing
with
hops
at
the
end
making
it
seem
lighter
than
it
is
on
tap
at
the
ginger
man
nyc
lacey
brown
body
and
tan
head
understaed
bitterness
despite
claims
of
high
ibu
roast
is
understated
oatswheat
mollasses
lots
of
malt
is
what
i
mostly
get
fuller
mouthfeel
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
really
nice
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
touch
of
hop
aroma
and
a
solid
crystalchocolate
malt
sweetness
its
dry
with
an
excellent
roasted
nose
the
taste
is
great
as
well
again
the
roasted
character
comes
through
nicely
with
dry
toasted
feel
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
add
a
beautiful
layer
of
sweetness
that
really
rounds
out
the
flavor
the
hop
character
is
outstanding
it
packs
a
powerful
bitterness
up
front
and
resinates
through
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
english
india
porter
it
would
be
an
excellent
porter
alone
but
the
hops
add
a
good
deal
of
depth
very
nice
can
smell
the
hops
off
the
bat
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
its
got
a
pretty
decent
bitterness
fading
into
the
malt
and
chocolate
and
then
back
to
the
pine
and
floral
hops
she
drinks
easy
and
delightful
not
thick
mediumbodied
but
very
pleasant
yes
another
pretty
thing
overall
something
i
would
drink
regularly
back
in
1855
and
could
see
myself
drinking
frequently
even
today
tasty
mix
of
bitter
sweet
and
roast
643
d
i
feel
like
pretty
things
as
a
brewery
are
always
on
the
overly
complex
side
of
their
brews
and
this
concoction
proves
my
point
still
worth
trying
if
this
is
your
preferred
style
as
an
english
porter
it
thats
what
youre
looking
for
exactly
this
is
absolute
perfection
o
really
digging
this
beer
and
i
am
not
normally
a
big
fan
of
porters
really
interesting
and
an
easy
drinker
overall
pretty
good
very
drinkable
gets
fairly
bitter
but
never
too
far
lots
of
nice
blended
flavors
long
finish
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
cascadian
dark
ale
but
doesnt
go
crazy
like
most
american
black
ales
do
nicely
done
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
go
get
some
initially
was
not
overly
impressed
by
this
but
damn
does
it
really
turn
around
quickly
delicious
this
is
good
about
what
i
was
expecting
didnt
disappoint
kinda
like
a
really
good
hoppy
black
tan
o
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
limited
porter
lots
of
complex
stuff
goin
on
with
this
one
a
great
recipe
from
the
mid
1800s
go
colonialism
the
beer
is
very
interesting
almost
like
an
ipa
porter
if
there
is
such
a
concoction
out
there
it
has
a
very
burnt
charred
and
biting
hop
flavor
with
all
the
roasted
chocolates
dark
malts
and
creaminess
that
you
would
fine
in
a
porter
it
isnt
boozy
nor
does
it
have
the
acerbic
caramel
and
oakiness
that
you
would
find
in
an
imperial
stout
just
the
smooth
milky
cacao
and
chocolate
powder
with
some
bittering
hop
that
defines
the
beer
i
will
go
back
for
another
and
add
to
the
review
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
was
like
an
american
black
ale
but
different
it
has
a
lot
of
porter
qualities
with
a
little
bit
of
extra
bitterness
overall
once
again
pretty
things
comes
through
with
an
amazing
beer
these
people
do
no
wrong
great
drinkability
complex
flavors
and
aromas
dont
pass
this
one
up
taste
is
bitter
bakers
chocolate
and
roast
malt
to
the
point
of
char
bursting
with
herbal
and
pine
sap
hops
hops
not
only
add
flavor
in
and
of
themselves
but
also
push
the
dark
malt
flavors
forward
beer
how
it
was
now
very
pleased
o
this
is
an
interesting
creation
from
pretty
things
lots
of
malts
lots
of
hops
overall
this
all
comes
together
well
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
not
a
particular
favorite
out
of
their
selection
still
definitely
worth
a
try
all
of
their
stuff
is
o
a
very
solid
new
brew
from
pretty
things
a
very
enjoyable
history
lesson
in
the
way
things
might
have
been
over
100
years
ago
a
hop
forward
porter
that
blurs
lines
and
peaks
interest
highly
recommended
overall
love
it
delicious
beer
highly
recommended
all
you
could
want
in
t
a
porter
and
more
wow
toasty
nose
solid
all
around
well
done
an
outstanding
glass
of
porter
here
looking
dark
as
pavement
from
the
tap
with
a
mocha
cream
head
on
top
and
a
deep
dark
complexion
that
flashes
milk
chocolate
brown
to
obsidian
black
the
nose
and
taste
are
in
line
with
one
another
loaded
with
coffee
notes
and
bitter
roasted
barley
it
could
be
called
a
stout
and
not
be
off
its
got
the
body
and
the
roast
levels
for
it
but
it
maintains
its
drinkability
with
a
very
clean
finish
from
a
robust
yeast
strain
and
a
minimal
hop
profile
i
think
its
very
authentic
but
also
very
rich
and
perfect
for
the
new
england
autumn
which
is
fast
approaching
so
smooth
in
mouthfeel
just
puffy
like
a
marshmallow
on
the
palate
but
loaded
with
the
dark
malt
character
one
of
the
better
homegrown
porters
ive
had
this
year
and
a
great
first
impression
was
made
here
on
me
by
the
greenport
harbor
folks
looks
from
their
listing
like
they
do
some
cool
stuff
too
would
recommend
this
to
those
who
like
a
guinness
type
stout
but
looking
for
a
little
more
adventure

solid
flavors
cold
weather
brew
save
it
for
last
as
its
not
a
quaffer
found
at
the
beer
bar
in
manhattan
and
served
in
a
large
chalice
this
porter
has
a
solid
black
brown
appearance
with
a
respectable
light
chocolate
colored
thin
layer
of
foam
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
suggests
a
boozy
chocolate
malt
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hop
the
flavor
brings
much
more
of
a
charcoal
grass
blend
and
very
little
chocolate
it
seems
to
have
an
odd
swampiness
to
it
a
bit
like
stagnant
water
that
isnt
wowing
me
but
it
generally
overcomes
this
to
provide
an
overall
okay
taste
the
grassy
hop
slides
into
a
sort
of
herbal
idea
in
conjunction
with
the
alligator
water
element
the
booziness
from
the
aroma
also
dissipates
as
you
adjust
to
the
flavor
of
this
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
midland
slightly
resinous
feel
as
porters
go
i
cant
help
but
wish
this
had
a
bit
more
malt
centric
flavors
and
the
tainted
water
thing
does
it
no
favors
if
the
off
flavor
is
intended
then
id
have
to
say
dont
waste
your
time
but
if
it
was
just
a
bad
line
or
something
this
might
have
potential
it
may
be
an
overhopped
outcome
but
as
one
who
worships
hop
indulgence
i
have
to
doubt
that
im
going
to
assume
something
was
a
bit
off
in
this
first
sample
but
it
makes
it
hard
to
judge
had
a
pint
at
astoria
bier
and
cheese
on
a
sunday
afternoon
overall
this
was
just
a
nice
smooth
yet
roasty
porter
there
was
a
mild
underlying
creaminess
that
should
come
with
an
english
porter
theres
no
hops
presence
but
the
barley
brings
a
great
mix
of
light
espresso
blackened
toast
and
touch
of
dry
dark
chocolate
order
a
pint
if
you
find
this
on
tap
a
huge
head
as
i
pour
from
my
64

yet

and
decent

does
get

of

a

that
leaves
a

note
of
fresh

leafiness
feel
is
medium
weight
with
a
crisp

carbonation
is
just
on
the
lower

still
enough
to
make
my
mouth
happy
a
great
session
ale
i
went
through

for

eating

and
watching

refreshing
quenching
and
satisfying
yum
on
cask
at
barcade
in
brooklyn
ny
the
beer
is
near
black
with
a
half
inch
of
head
ample
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
offers
chocolate
malt
roast
a
bit
of
cocoa
in
the
flavor
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
pretty
smooth
on
the
palate
overall
this
was
ok
hard
to
pass
up
a
cask
ale
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
pleasant
mix
of
malts
and
ultimately
how
smoothly
the
beer
drank
the
grain
profile
showed
many
faces
with
rye
earthiness
and
even
that
dog
food
graininess
but
in
a
good
way
the
nose
was
found
to
be
mild
and
things
lightened
up
too
much
in
the
taste
at
times
the
sourness
was
also
getting
up
there
with
a
pretty
acidic
finish
but
really
it
was
an
appropriate
decent
beer
for
the
style
overall
the
experience
wasnt
bad
but
not
quite
as
enjoyable
as
the
draft
version
i
may
have
spoiled
myself
a
bit
since
that
original
pour
with
a
wide
range
of
quality
porters
and
perhaps
gotten
a
little
more
discerning
enjoyable
clearly
a
quality
creation
in
brewing
more
good
beer
from
long
island
ny
o
may
be
my
favorite
greenport
beer
really
a
solid
porter
that
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
would
like
o
great
flavor
for
a
low
abv
beer
another
surprising
gem
from
a
brewery
i
had
never
heard
of
o
its
your
prototype
porter
o
a
local
treat
that
has
me
thinking
that
greenport
is
a
place
i
should
be
keeping
an
eye
on
o
flavorful
drinkable
porter
with
a
commendably
modest
abv
overall
as
very
good
beer
and
one
that
ill
have
as
often
as
i
can
find
it
113
this
is
a
dang
flavorful
porter
and
at
a
low
abv
so
it
gets
bonus
points
i
really
like
the
woodylight
smoke
flavor
best
that
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
d
this
is
a
solid
drinking
porter
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
its
a
very
solid
porter
and
definitely
worth
a
try
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
its
a
great
example
of
this
style
d
overall
pretty
easy
drinker
not
a
bad
porter
but
a
bit
on
the
watery
and
bitter
side
for
my
tastes
good
one
for
the
style
and
worth
a
try
for
porter
fans
reviewed

on
tap
at
the
brewery
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
malt
bitter
chocolate
and
sweet
sugary
malt
flavor
of
burnt
roasted
malt
bitter
chocolate
and
pretzels
ok
but
a
little
bland
i
was
hoping
for
a
touch
more
flavor
and
a
stronger
palate
from
this
one
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
thick
frothy
head
with
some
caramel
aroma
in
the
nose
the
lacing
and
billowing
is
quite
evident
its
an
enticing
beer
the
best
that
this
small
new
compact
brewery
has
to
offer
and
a
real
seekerouter
the
distribution
isnt
much
beyond
greenport
but
they
will
be
on
their
way
if
they
keep
making
beers
like
the
black
duck
there
is
a
pumpkin
ale
coming
out
in
a
couple
of
weeks
overall
a
superior
porter
enjoyed
fresh
from
the
source
the
impressive
dark
malt
character
of
the
ale
reminded
me
of
an
english
porter
from
a
cask
which
was
highlighted
by
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
bitterness
it
was
remarkably
easy
to
drink
in
the
hot
weather
of
an
august
afternoon
in
greenport
ny
it
seemed
to
mild
in
the
abv
area
and
it
tasted
great
for
a
new
entry
to
li
o
nothing
special
lots
of
better
porters
out
there
than
this
the
lambic
yeast
does
add
a
bit
of
a
twist
but
not
enough
for
it
to
differentiate
itself
black

into
my
sapp
with
big
khaki

there
is
a
funky
sour
nose
here
taste
is

feel
and
good

tasty

o
coffee
forward
with
surprisingly
little
sourness
acidity
in
the
flavor
profile
based
on
what
comes
through
in
the
nose
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
repeat
either
more
towards
the
lambic
side
than
the
porter
i
wonder
if
any
english
brewers
bottle
funky
porters
a
great
belgian
sour
beer
with
a
unique
darkness
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in
churchkey
in
dc
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
on
tap
it
was
a
bit
bland
and
flat
but
was
substantially
more
flavorful
and
even
more
sour
in
the
bottle
o
this
is
an
extremely
unique
brew
as
mentioned
before
i
am
a
big
fan
of
sours
and
porters
however
i
prefer
the
sournesstartness
in
very
pale
or
red
flanders
beers
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
because
of
its
uniqueness
and
i
dont
dislike
it
by
any
means
but
i
think
i
might
prefer
either
porters
or
sours
not
both
mixed
up
3

the
sour
quality
definitely
comes
thru
here
and
it
is
an
interesting
addition
to
a
porter
flavor
profile
on
the
fruitier
side
of
porters
dark
sour
berry
comes
out
a
bit
ashey
abundant
carbonation
overall
its
a
unique
spin
on
a
porter
lot
of

d
this
is
very
good
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
at
the
price
paid
but
glad
i
tried
it
ointeresng
the
wild
yeast
works
with
the
porter
during
some
sips
then
during
others
it
becomes
a
bit
perplexing
happy
to
find
is
one
though
o
well
this
smelled
good
the
flavors
though
were
simple
and
bare
nothing
offensive
but
not
deep
but
the
mouthfeel
was
the
biggest
letdown
way
too
thin
maybe
not
quite
watery
but
borderline
not
at
all
what
i
expect
from
a
porter
it
wasnt
a
drain
pour
or
anything
but
i
wont
be
having
another
quite
disappointing
from
this
brewery
o
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
its
probably
something
wouldnt
seek
out
again
the
flavors
of
the
porter
are
light
and
clean
and
the
lambic
yeast
adds
an
interesting
complexity
overall
though
its
pretty
straight
forward
o
porter
fans
oughtta
check
it
out
but
be
braced
for
the
wild
ale
tartness
it
isnt
overwhelming
or
anything
but
it
was
omnipresent
in
my
drink
wild
ale
fans
specially
if
you
like
midnight
brett
or
other
blackdark
alesourwild
hybrids
oughtta
check
it
out
too
im
neither
a
big
porter
nor
wild
ale
drinker
but
this
was
one
of
those
beers
that
kinda
defied
style
boundaries
and
taken
as
a
singular
entityentry
into
the
world
of
beer
it
was
quite
good
the
porter
base
was
very
mellow
and
supportive
while
the
yeasts
kept
every
sip
very
alive
and
bright
with
a
dusky
tartness
o
very
good
example
of
an
english
porter
so
this
is
a
porter
with
wild
yeast
looks
like
a
porter
tastes
like
a
sour
porter
or
as
some
obnoxious
jackass
i
recently
had
the
distinct
pleasure
of
crossing
paths
with
since
its
using
wild
yeasts
its
infected
mildly
sour
thing
really
nothing
too
crazy
a
pleasant
drinker
but
nothing
overly
memorable
im
always
open
to
trying
something
from
this
brewery
but
wouldnt
return
to
this
one
i
think
overall
its
certainly
a
tasty
beer
i
was
glad
i
could
pickup
the
lambic
yeast
is
a
very
interesting
dimension
of
this
porter
which
makes
the
chocolate
and
cherry
notes
excel
and
adds
a
pleasant
dryness
o
interesting
beer
but
not
one
that
i
am
going
to
be
looking
for
again
would
i
have
it
again
if
presented
to
me
sure
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
odd
blend
of
stylesflavors
that
just
doesnt
suit
my
taste
buds
incredibly
well
glad
to
try
it
but
didnt
blow
me
away
o
this
beer
is
easier
to
drink
but
seems
like
it
could
have
stronger
flavors
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
prost
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
english
porter
style
but
this
is
a
decent
offering
that
really
grows
on
you
over
time
worth
trying
as
kind
of
the
ugly
stepchild
of
the
3f
lineup
pours
a
hazy
very
dark
brown
with
two
fingers
thick
of
dense
light
brown
foam
sheet
of
delicate
lace
halfway
down
the
glass
smell
toasted
brown
bread
black
cherries
toffee
mild
earthiness
taste
brown
sugar
raisin
toast
cola
cherry
not
quite
tart
grain
twang
medium
bodied
very
fine
creamy
carbonation
overall
im
really
digging
this
beer
it
serves
as
a
great
example
that
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
over
the
top
and
in
your
face
to
be
great
3
fonteinens
lambics
are
awesome
and
deserving
of
the
praise
they
get
but
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
as
well
a
beer
that
is
very
different
a
wild
or
sour
porter
with
all
the
funk
of
good
lambic
but
a
dark
malt
base
that
shows
some
dried
cherry
in
its
pucker
as
well
as
some
strong
earthy
almost
composting
flavors
and
aromas
light
brown
in
color
well
medium
brown
but
not
as
deep
and
dark
as
normal
porter
without
a
ton
of
head
shorty
lived
rather
patchy
and
off
white
it
smells
like
dried
red
fruits
and
lambic
i
dont
get
the
darkness
of
the
black
malt
until
the
flavor
and
the
finish
at
that
its
dark
and
earthy
not
a
ton
of
bitterness
from
the
roast
but
subtle
dark
chocolate
notes
come
in
which
dont
really
jive
all
the
way
with
the
acid
in
the
finish
but
which
brings
out
the
best
of
the
dried
cherry
flavor
and
a
little
of
its
sweetness
well
carbonated
and
dry
on
the
mouth
very
light
in
feel
for
a
porter
im
not
sure
this
beer
is
totally
successful
but
it
is
unique
so
credit
it
for
that
sort
of
lost
in
the
middle
not
quite
a
sour
not
quite
a
dark
ale
it
gets
caught
out
in
no
mans
land
a
bit
but
i
like
it
anyway
othis
beer
is
an
odd
one
i
enjoyed
the
aroma
which
was
complex
and
interesting
the
taste
however
falls
a
little
short
the
lightly
tart
fruit
flavors
are
an
odd
mix
with
the
more
roastedcocoa
malt
flavors
it
tastes
a
little
disjointed
i
also
think
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
thanks
to
the
higher
levels
of
carbonation
interesting
for
sure
but
probably
not
something
i
need
to
try
again

with

then
quickly
develops

sour
dark

finishing
tart
and
somewhat

with
a
light
metallic
flavor
medium

with
fresh
active
carbonation
an
interesting
and
unusually
flavored
dark

beer
smelling
and
beginning
like
a
porter
but
quickly
showing
its
wild
yeast
and
light
belgian
character
in
a
blind
taste
i
might
suspect
a
compromised
porter
or
stout
except
in
this
case
the
finishing
sourness
is
intentional
taken
from
that
perspective
an
interesting
and
well
made
dark
ale
that
works
well
im
not
expecting
the
the
tart
finish
and
this
style
does
not
appeal
to
me
as
much
as
a
traditional
porter
sour
fans
who
also
enjoy
dark
malt
should
take
this
for
a
spin
interesting
but
not
my
style
the
bottle
shop
got
this
in
yesterday
and
i
couldnt
resist
a
try
claims
to
be
unusual
it
is
pours
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
leaves
a
coating
of
lacing
down
the
glass
much
like
a
guinness
draught
the
aroma
contains
chocolate
sweet
malt
faint
fruits
and
sourness
similar
taste
with
some
bright
fruitiness
a
building
sour
lactic
backbone
and
a
long
bitter
sour
raisiny
finish
the
sourness
is
mild
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
slightly
creamy
due
to
the
head
again
like
a
guinness
draught
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
tastes
more
like
a
porter
with
some
sourness
rather
than
a
wild
ale
enjoyable
a
bit
expensive
but
a
worthwhile
experience
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
but
not
in
a
rush
to
buy
more
o
didnt
know
what
to
expect
not
quite
as
sour
as
id
expect
from
3f
but
still
super
good
glad
i
picked
this
up
pours
black
with
a
frothy
two
finger
head
that
lays
on
top
of
the
beer
ohsocarefully
head
recedes
back
a
bit
but
most
of
it
hangs
around
throughout
a
sticky
lace
lines
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
tart
cherry
toasted
grains
and
a
bit
of
smoke
and
mild
chocolate
the
tart
smell
is
pretty
overpowering
upfront
taste
of
cocoa
nibs
a
bit
of
smoke
in
the
middle
with
a
strong
tart
finish
beer
is
fullbodied
and
well
carbonated
this
style
is
a
new
one
for
me
i
have
had
both
porters
and
sour
ales
but
never
a
combo
of
the
two
interesting
beer
nonetheless
a
rather
intense
experience
this
must
be
about
2
years
old
by
now
and
the
brett
has
really
deveoped
in
the
bottle
looks
nice
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
overwhelmingly
funky
and
sour
with
only
a
hint
of
malt
coming
through
the
result
is
relatively
complex
but
unbalanced
good
body
interesting
but
im
not
sure
its
really
my
cup
of
tea
it
would
be
nice
to
try
a
younger
version
of
it
sometime
for
comparison
a
worthy
effort
grab
one
if
youre
a
fan
of
sourswild
ales
o
decent
belgian
porter
decent
english
porter
not
a
lambic
in
case
you
thought
so
had
a
real
mental
wrestling
match
over
this
was
too
curious
to
wait
and
tasted
it
the
very
day
purchased
at
the
brewery
fridged
briefly
to
cellar
temp
and
served
in
a
tulip
poured
coffeelike
not
that
leggy
but
mahogany
dark
with
a
pinkie
of
densely
packedcustardcolored
head
roasted
coffee
aromas
along
wish
toast
anise
cinnamon
and
maybe
mint
or
some
sweet
herb
some
cherry
a
bit
of
yeast
and
cellar
but
not
pronounced
in
any
on
those
notes
i
didnt
have
a
strong
mental
image
on
what
to
expect
tastewise
but
my
expectation
was
of
a
cideryfruity
sour
attack
with
a
swartbier
sweetness
coming
through
it
turned
out
more
the
reverse
i
get
a
roasty
porterlike
first
impression
with
good
sarsaparilla
vanilla
clove
pepper
swirling
around
and
then
some
lactic
sourness
bleeds
in
becoming
more
and
more
pronounced
as
it
lingers
into
a
more
sour
and
woody
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
not
a
mouthful
a
bit
thin
soapy
just
a
gentle
lap
of
carbonation
to
give
it
some
presence
its
complex
odd
something
to
wrestle
with
before
i
decide
whether
to
embrace
it
im
glad
in
have
a
second
bottle
for
another
taste
but
not
now
overall
a
really
nice
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
porter
wish
this
was
easier
to
come
by
for
me
o
not
a
bad
porter
very
easily
drinkable
not
my
favorite
from
3f
but
id
definitely
have
this
again
ba
cheers
i
really
like
the
combination
of
sour
and
roasted
chocolate
flavors
the
bitterness
does
not
go
all
that
well
as
it
warms
up
though
i
knew
it
was
not
going
to
be
the
typical
porter
when
i
saw
it
was
brewed
with
wild
yeast
one
never
knows
what
to
expect
from
wild
yeast
interesting
as
it
can
be
to
catch
overall
definitely
not
your
ordinary
drie
fonteinen
beer
clean
combination
of
sour
and
roast
though
which
isnt
a
common
attribute
o
i
guess
i
can
expect
nothing
less
from
drie
fonteinen
as
i
have
said
this
is
very
much
a
rustic
porter
but
made
in
the
extremely
old
and
traditional
style
i
really
really
dig
this
o
an
interesting
beer
chocolate
and
brett
deep
roasty
malt
character
lingering
bitterness
in
the
dry
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
acidity
woody
and
smooth
restrained
wildness
and
an
overall
pleasant
character
a
dry
roasty
porter
with
a
hint
of
rustic
funk
on
the
periphery
well
balanced
and
an
interesting
concept
better
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
am
assuming
it
is
an
entirely
different
batch
and
fairly
fresh
the
tart
funky
yeast
does
just
enough
to
overcome
the
big
traditional
porter
notes
and
it
all
comes
together
nicely
o
overall
this
is
very
enjoyable
nice
mild
taste
nice
sour
character
without
destroying
my
palate
i
think
this
achieves
a
good
balance
and
would
go
for
it
again
if
it
becomes
available
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
especially
as
it
warms
up
it
has
a
musty
nature
that
i
really
enjoy
and
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
changes
as
it
most
definitely
will
starts
like
a
dark
brown
ale
a
combination
of
sourness
and
darker
nearly
burnt
malt
short
aftertaste
thinnish
body
with
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
the
flavor
is
very
pleasant
with
slight
dark
cherry
taste
with
subtle
currant
and
dark
toasted
grain
flavor
with
a
light
element
of
tangy
yeast
and
nutty
woodiness
with
gentle
vanillalike
quality
overall
this
is
a
complex
tasty
and
quaffable
porter
i
was
really
happy
i
got
to
try
this
on
tap
as
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
strength
the
light
brett
quality
adds
a
unique
dimension
to
the
porter
and
is
very
enjoyable
nice
brew
different
and
could
very
well
have
been
a
bad
experience
i
wonder
how
this
will
age
and
if
the
tart
will
overcome
the
balance
and
kill
this
right
now
very
drinkable
o
overall
this
would
make
a
very
nice
everyday
drinker
fairly
light
in
flavor
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
it
doesnt
quite
meet
the
expectation
of
flavor
for
a
7
sour
porter
by
this
brewery
however
give
this
to
me
for
1012
a
sixer
and
we
might
have
something
beer
is
of
medium
weight
with
carbonation
of
mediumlight
intensity
the
result
is
a
smooth
slightly
foamy
mouthfeel
that
is
never
fizzy
or
harsh
closes
dry
with
some
modest
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
enjoyed
this
one
while
pregaming
going
out
jazz
club
hopping
in
new
orleans
at
avenue
pub
served
from
tap
into
a
chalice
poured
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
milk
chocolate
roasted
malt
earth
and
subtle
funk
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
when
i
saw
the
description
of
this
one
on
the
menu
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
if
i
am
completely
honest
however
what
i
found
was
actually
quite
nice
it
had
all
of
the
aspects
of
a
nice
porter
going
on
in
it
with
just
a
kiss
of
funk
to
make
it
interesting
i
really
never
would
have
thought
about
throwing
these
two
aspects
together
but
they
seemed
to
work
decently
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
on
tap
as
it
was
definitely
an
interesting
brew
330

the
beer

with
about
an

head
retention
and

are
both
good
the
brew
smells
like
chocolate
roasted

coffee
sweet
and
tart
fruit
and
some
molasses
it
tastes
similar
to
how
it
smells

roasted

chocolate
tart
and
sweet
dark
fruit
plums
cherries
raisins
and
a
bit
of
nuts
and
red
wine
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
definitely
isnt
a
traditional
porter
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
thats
different
and
doesnt
really
fit
into
a
certain
style
then
youll
probably
like
this
brew
as
much
as
i
did
the
flavors
and
how
they
attach
to
the
palate
reminds
me
of
those
english
cask
porters
that
are
a
blend
of
fresher
chocolaty
versions
and
older
musty
vinous
ones
its
a
fantastic
porter
that
dares
to
explore
the
rustic
taste
of
years
gone
by
instead
of
denying
in
fear
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
smooth
complex
and
very
enjoyable
people
who
are
fans
of
sour
porters
or
old
english
porters
will
love
this
it
has
a
very
minor
mineral
edge
and
faint
familiarity
about
it
but
it
is
very
much
its
own
unique
creation
that
i
found
to
be
very
enjoyable
the
7
abv
is
masterfully
hidden
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
beer
nicely
done
t
starts
pretty
toasty
with
hints
of
coffee
finish
brings
a
tart
untie
plum
flavor
with
some
raisin
as
well
interesting
but
i
dont
think
i
would
do
this
again
drinkability
is
fine
taste
wise
for
a
rare
expensive
beer
one
is
enough
overall
interesting
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
the
tartness
and
cherry
fruit
flavors
are
nice
but
the
chalky
black
patent
like
roasted
malts
put
a
dent
in
most
of
the
flavors
to
keep
it
from
being
too
good
of
a
beer
pours
a
slightly
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
campfire
sour
fruits
and
some
brett
funk
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
interesting
smoke
sour
and
funky
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
odd
beer
that
is
pretty
good
but
all
over
the
place
with
its
aromas
and
flavors
this
is
quite
tasty
i
am
not
sure
i
would
prefer
it
to
a
normal
porter
as
the
sharper
funky
brettanomyces
notes
clash
a
bit
with
the
roasted
porter
notes
the
aroma
is
definitely
a
bit
nicer
and
richer
than
the
flavor
not
nearly
as
tart
as
ecpcted
o
phenomenal
the
first
sour
beer
that
ive
loved
highly
recommended
will
have
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
roasty
bitter
at
the
end
thin
up
front
fills
out
quickly
the
midpalate
is
a
chalky
funky
yeasty
metallic
mildly
offputting
flavor
that
sort
of
burns
and
bothers
me
not
a
repeat
but
interesting
none
the
less
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
good
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
brings
faint
roast
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
plus
some
nice
sourness
flavor
falls
along
the
same
lines
pretty
good
blend
of
the
two
components
medium
body
and
a
dry
slightlysour
finish
pretty
good

feel

at
about

with
a

its

nice
and
i
would
have
no
problem
taking
down
a

two
of

i
would
not
go
out

with

this
beer
was
served
relatively
cold
and
changed
a
lot
as
it
warmed
up
the
aroma
was
some
light
roastiness
a
bit
of
coffee
some
lactic
notes
barnyard
funk
and
some
light
lemon
the
funky
notes
and
non
traditional
porter
aromas
came
out
more
as
it
warmed
up
the
taste
is
some
dark
roasted
coffee
followed
by
some
light
lemon
zest
a
bit
of

some

a
bit
of

and
some

on

again
the
roasted

were

significantly
better
as

up

pour
with
a

the
smell

of

with

more
porter
than
sour
the
beer
has
a
roasty

funk
is
noticed
throughout
but
does
not
dominate
the
beer
medium

heavy
in
body
sort
of
a
strange

interesting
to
try
wouldnt
get
it
again
though
pours

scent
of
heavy
roasted
coffee
light
chocolate
and
dark
bread
crust
combine
with
light
fruit
and
mild

and
sour
notes
taste
is
mild
and
light
with
the
tart
sourness
covering
up
much
of
the
roast
profile
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
and
light
in
carbonation
quite
dry
the
experiment
is
appreciated
but
the
execution
is
lacking
most
of
the
dark
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
have
covered
up
the
barrels
flavors
this
beer
is
very
barrely
tasting
some
serious
vinous
oak
going
on
in
the
nose
tastes
a
little
bit
like
brett
and
coffee
but
they
do
a
pretty
darn
good
job
of
merging
the
two
worlds
i
enjoyed
this
one
from
start
to
fin
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
step
outside
of
the
box
by
drie
fonteinen
despite
initially
thinking
a
bretty
porter
sounded
excessive
i
was
really
taken
by
this
beer
overall
a
bit
weird
the
flavors
work
for
me
but
i
think
something
was
missing
dont
know
that
i
would
have
it
again
d
very
drinkable
the
balance
of
regular
porter
elements
and
the
sour
elements
brought
upon
by
the
lambic
yeast
is
really
nice
o
this
was
different
but
nothing
that
i
necessarily
cared
for
had
my
pour
moved
onto
other
things
overall
this
beer
is
far
from
bad
however
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
maybe
some
time
in
the
bottle
could
help
overall
this
is
a
good
porter
though
in
my
opinion
it
falls
short
of
armands
other
offerings
i
preferred
it
to
sn
exportation
but
i
think
that
sfto
still
stands
at
the
top
of
the
sour
porter
style
for
me
the
body
is
full
and
robust
with
sharp
carbonation
not
bad
but
i
think
ive
had
porters
i
would
take
over
this
one
o
interesting
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
funk
and
a
little
more
roastiness
but
thats
just
personal
preference
i
would
get
again
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
nice
dark
blackbrown
with
a
finger
of
creamy
beige
head
that
dwindled
down
to
a
ringlet
leaving
lots
of
attractive
foamy
lace
behind
a
little
swirl
of
the
glass
would
stir
up
a
little
whorl
of
bubbles
on
the
top
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
mild
chocolate
yeast
and
notes
of
citrus
with
a
touch
of
funk
taste
started
out
like
a
typical
porter
roasty
malty
touch
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
much
lighter
though
and
within
a
second
or
two
it
was
obvious
that
something
else
was
going
on
tart
cherries
lemon
peel
and
belgian
yeast
obviously
coming
into
play
and
a
bit
of
funk
as
implied
in
the
aroma
but
balanced
it
wasnt
like
ooh
a
porter
i
can
has
malts
then
you
take
a
sip
and
pucker
your
lips
in
revulsion
while
the
balance
was
there
i
still
felt
this
was
a
bit
weak
overall
thin
and
not
as
fullbodied
as
it
seemed
it
should
have
been
still
mighty
good
though
fuller
medium
body
higher
carbonation
tingly
and
dry
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
by
3f
which
seems
to
work
well
black
like
ink
with
a
good
sized
head
and
stringy
lace
big
mocha
aromas
make
up
much
of
the
nose
so
far
it
smells
like
a
normal
porter
that
changes
in
the
taste
you
guessed
it
its
a
sour
porter
mocha
and
cocoa
notes
are
subtle
though
the
tartness
is
still
mild
still
fairly
smooth
and
not
very
acidic
while
its
not
a
worldbeater
it
does
show
that
theres
more
to
drie
fonteinen
than
simply
lambic
a
mildly
soured
cherry
stout
its
not
particularly
drinkable
or
all
that
exciting
though
it
is
more
than
decent
a
very
untraditional
take
on
a
very
traditional
style
i
knew
before
ordering
this
that
it
would
be
a
sour
porter
but
i
still
had
a
difficult
time
stomaching
it
a
rough
go
to
say
the
least
o
maybe
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
3f
but
i
quite
liked
it
overall
i
think
it
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
personally
like
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
maybe
its
that
i
find
it
to
be
a
very
interesting
beer
and
that
scores
some
points
with
me
i
plan
on
ageing
a
couple
of
these
and
i
think
we
may
have
a
completely
different
animal
in
a
couple
years
o
good
stuff
i
like
the
flavors
and
has
potential
to
get
better
with
age
given
its
extremely
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
interesting
but
not
particularly
memorable
o
interesting
beer
not
really
bold
in
any
sense
but
i
liked
it
for
what
it
was
mild
acidity
with
medium
body
and
higher
carbonation
interesting
at
least
but
only
decent
overall
reading
all
the
reviews
i
expected
a
very
average
beer
with
clear
sourness
in
it
i
have
to
say
the
sourness
is
only
slightly
present
and
mostly
in
the
smell
maybe
it
is
because
i
am
a
geuze
drinker
but
this
is
more
like
a
regular
porter
for
me
nice
beer
i
understand
the
concept
of
a
sour
brettinoculated
porter
but
i
dont
think
its
a
marriage
that
was
ever
meant
to
take
place
nonintentionally
metallic
and
intentionally
sour
bad
combo

is
not
too
full
with
super
great
carbonation
nothing
close
to
a
standard
porter
but
a
very
nice
beer
nonetheless
d
everything
about
this
beer
is
pretty
good
except
one
horrendous
aspect
of
the
nose
d
this
started
out
alright
but
got
worse
as
time
went
out
im
not
certain
this
is
a
very
successful
experiment
i
think
i
preferred
southampton
vic
for
similar
approach
to
making
an
infected
porter
i
had
no
problem
with
46oz
of
this
and
it
went
down
fairly
quickly
but
its
a
very
strange
beer
and
definitely
isnt
for
everyone
o
strange
beer
a
belgian

sour
ale
woodbarreld
nice
beer
for
the
summer
light
chilled
and
the
bqq
nice
body
it
went
down
like
water
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
but
nowhere
near
as
much
as
their
worldclass
gueuze
creations
overall
a
porter
in
name
only
for
an
infected
porter
however
this
one
is
actually
alright
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
the
other
infected
stouts
ive
had
in
the
past
year
such
as
infected
abyss
sexual
chocolate
and
black
tot
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
would
be
going
too
far
but
the
mixed
fermentation
seems
to
have
kept
the
sourness
in
control
enough
that
i
could
certainly
finish
it
without
much
issue
not
my
style
but
to
be
honest
its
done
really
well
and
some
people
out
there
would
probably
love
this
yup
the
only
3
fonteinen
so
far
sourness
in
beer
is
just
not
my
thing
putting
that
aside
i
think
this
a
very
good
attempt
to
mix
a
porter
and
a
sour
beer
if
the
sour
part
doesnt
scare
you
this
might
be
very
interesting
for
you

the

solid
representation
of

o
good
but
not
great
offering
maybe
just
a
smidgen
too
sweet
atmosphere
is
okay
fair
head
and
some
light

is
characteristic
of
the
style
coffee
and
chocolate
most
notably
roasted
malt
with
some
unusual
fruity
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
unwelcome
pungency
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
o
good
porter
but
ive
had
better
really
enjoy
the
coffee
aroma
but
its
nit
amazing
otherwise
still
a
pretty
good
porter
o
the
lightbodied
nature
of
this
porter
makes
it
very
east
to
drink
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
this
is
a
pretty
decent
porter
like
the
review
i
posted
for
the
weeheavier
it
seems
like
a
good
warm
up
beer
or
a
good
starter
its
not
bold
by
any
means
but
does
have
some
great
flavors
particularly
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolates
going
on
o
very
enjoyable
i
like
the
different
complexities
to
the
flavorsaromas
that
are
slightly
sweet
but
do
not
contribute
overall
sweetness
to
the
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
definitely
one
i
would
have
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
sweet
with
a
mild
roast
with
a
nice
coffee
flavor
throughout
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
have
it
again
if
this
were
my
local
beer
overall
a
tasty
easy
drinking
porter
overall
impression
this
is
a
pedestrian
take
on
the
style
sure
its
easy
to
drink
but
it
lacks
anything
that
would
set
it
out
in
a
crowd
reasonably
priced
at
least
when
purchased
at
the
brewery
o
a
tasty
porter
for
sure
creamy
and
chocolaty
only
real
downside
is
that
its
a
touch
thin
but
it
didnt
detract
too
much
this
is
a
good
porter
to
style
but
simple
the
coffee
notes
definitely
dominate
the
flavor
and
the
mustiness
is
off
putting
but
not
overwhelming
its
also
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
overall
it
was
a
good
one
to
try
but
its
probably
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
good
dose
of
coffee
and
chocolate
was
inside
here
and
that
became
evident
from
the
very
beginning
lots
of
roasted
malts
here
with
a
good
bit
of
sweetness
a
bitter
dark
coffee
flavor
mixed
in
with
bakers
chocolate
some
nice
vanilla
maybe
in
there
sweetening
it
up
but
very
light
nice
touches
of
lactose
as
well
in
here
though
i
have
to
say
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
a
little
stronger
of
a
flavor
as
by
the
time
it
warmed
up
it
started
to
fade
and
it
all
blended
together
the
finish
started
as
bitter
but
faded
back
to
sweet
licorice
and
caramel
flavor
odd
finish
but
still
very
nice
overall
excellent
porter
that
is
done
right
solid
a
surprisingly
thin
body
with
a
sharp
tangy
effervescence
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
watery
fortunately
this
was
not
an
overhopped
west
coast
style
american
porter
sadly
it
just
wasnt
that
good
the
pour
was
the
high
point

d
im
not
pissed
that
im
drinking
this
but
i
really
doubt
ill
ever
buy
another
bottle
theres
too
many
good
beers
out
there
to
drink
a
boring
one
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
on
the
higher
side
carbonation
o
this
is
for
the
most
part
an
average
beer
hardly
the
worst
ive
ever
had
but
not
very
good
either
a
good
porter
that
stays
true
to

of
the
best

to

i
got
this

in

for

sent
it

to
whoever
you

not

at

but
i
am
a
huge
sucker
for
any
porter
overall
i
would
not
purchase
this
beer
but
i
was
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
if
you
couldnt
tell
by
my
ratings
this
is
a
good
beer
good
thats
about
where
its
stops
but
in

is
something
i
can
rely
on

feel
is
very
thin
and
the
taste
matches
somewhat
its
a
little
weak
the
taste
as
i
mentioned
is
a
little
weaker
than
id
prefer
but
not
horrible
its
decently
balanced
with
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
hops
are
very
understated
its
a
decent
porter
but
there
are
certainly
better
ones
solid
porter
pretty
drinkable
but
not
as
robust
as
others
on
the
market
drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
solid
brew
from
a
local
brewery
overall
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
easily
about
this
beer
otherwise
the
roastiness
and
lack
of
balance
were
too
much
drinkability
stays
on
the
soft
sweet
malty
side
of
things
making
for
a
pleasing
tasty
brew
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
the
little
bar
i
was
drinking
in
as
i
passed
through
asheville
had
only
a
few
taps
and
most
were
local
when
i
said
i
wanted
to
try
the
beers
this
one
got
a
few
mixed
reviews
but
i
enjoyed
it
the
body
was
dark
it
also
formed
a
nice
head
and
lace
the
aroma
was
malty
more
than
anything
the
flavor
was
not
overly
roasty
but
just
right
the
roasty
bitterness
equaled
out
the
toffee
and
chocolate
tones
well
the
mouthfeel
was
just
a
little
bit
thinner
than
most
porters
overall
it
was
a
good
beer

i
love
this
beer
poured
out
a
deep

a
small
amount
light
gets
through
a
thin
tan
head
barely
hangs
on
past
the
first
minute
and
no
lacing
is
left
behind
there
is
a
good
amount
of
detritus
floating
around
definitely
a
negative
there
is
a
small
amount
of
smell
just
nondescript
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
though
is
full
of
flavor
deep
roasted
malt
notes
with
a
nice
earthy
hops
and
notunpleasant
astringent
hit
there
is
a
decent
weight
to
the
body
my
preference
would
be
a
little
fuller
but
its
not
thin
by
any
means
the
flavor
for
me
is
what
does
it
a
not
complex
but
very
good
taste
mad
river
steelhead
porter
served
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
on
it
i
did
notice
a
high
amount
of
residual
yeast
and
musty
things
in
each
bottle
here
we
have
a
decent
porter
with
a
flair
for
scotchy
smokiness
in
between
sips
i
noticed
a
long
lasting
smoke
taste
in
my
mouth
as
if
i
had
been
smoking
a
nice
cigar
or
drinking
an
islay
scotch
at
6
5
alcohol
with
medium
body
this
beer
isnt
going
to
overwhelm
or
inspire
you
but
to
me
its
an
above
average
beer
of
a
niche
style
once
again
the
beer
is
mild
for
something
called
a
scotch
porter
which
might
scare
away
most
casual
beer
drinkers
this
is
a
beer
that
critical
drinkers
will
appreciate
and
adventurous
laypeople
will
like
too
malty
with
well
balanced
molasses
and
smoke
overall
an
average
porter
with
some
additional
intrigue
and
smoke
flavor
make
this
beer
something
to
check
out
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
somewhat
a
hybrid
of
the
current
versions
of
the
porter
and
scotch
ale
easy
to
drink
with
well
hidden
alcohol
i
would
definitely
grab
another
one
of
these
when
i
come
across
it
this
is
an
amazingly
flavorful
porter
given
the
abv
i
am
very
pleasantly
surprised
good
flavor
and
aroma
and
very
good
body
definitely
worth
trying
remarks
tasty
overall
but
a
little
too
sweet
love
a
hybrid
brew
and
keen
for
this
one
which
pours
the
darkest
brown
non
see
through
hue
with
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
subtle
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
peated
smokey
maltsdark
chocolate
and
roasted
caramelthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
above
moderate
carbonation
and
on
taste
it
starts
off
like
a
scotch
ale
and
finishes
like
a
porter
with
tastes
first
up
of
smokey
peated
maltsa
touch
of
whiskeyroasted
caramela
dash
of
coffee
liqueur
and
finished
with
a
dark
chocolate
bittersweetness
and
overall
its
definitely
half
scotch
ale
and
half
porter
which
works
and
i
for
one
enjoyed
it
and
buy
again
without
doubt
cheers
o
a
nice
porter
chocolatey
for
sure
very
mellow
flavors
and
smooth
drinking
goes
down
very
easy
a
great
example
of
a
simple
english
porter
true
to
style
imo
overall
quality
brew
good
flavor
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
dare
i
say
sessionable
incidentally
i
had
a
slice
of
chocolate
topped
cheesecake
toward
the
end
of
my
drink
and
the
pairing
was
nothing
short
of
heaven
wish
ida
paired
them
together
a
lot
sooner
for
those
that
think
the
stone
and
alaskan
smoked
porters
are
too
smokey
give
this
one
a
go
i
dont
think
youll
be
disappointed
a
fair
porter
that
delivers
on
the
basics
nothing
overthetop
and
no
real
wowfactor
but
very
enjoyable
overall
conclusion
amazingly
true
to
style
well
done
mad
river
this
is
the
first
of
their
beers
than
i
have
tried
and
i
wasnt
expecting
something
this
good
overall
average
and
kind
of
boring
im
thinking
this
was
possibly
an
old
bottle
it
actually
isnt
bad
but
everything
seems
so
subtle
and
one
note
overall
a
muted
chocolatey
porter
review
slightly
revised
after
further
sampling
in
june
sept
2012
may
2013
much
better
than
i
expected
it
smelled
like
i
expected
but
i
was
blown
away
by
the
balance
in
the
taste
and
feel
and
thats
what
put
it
over
the
top
for
me
pours
a
dark
chestnut
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
smell
is
a
bit
of
toasted
grain
taste
is
rich
velvety
caramel
malt
followed
by
a
rich
peaty
smoke
flavor
mouthfeel
is
smooth
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
but
nothing
crazy
overall
a
great
beer
i
will
be
getting
this
again
overall
not
a
bad
porter
typically
i
like
my
porter
a
bit
smoother
with
more
body
and
a
little
less
smoke
o
a
bit
of
smokiness
dark
caramels
and
some
bass
in
the
chocolate
dress
up
the
standard
english
porter
quite
nicely
no
confusing
this
with
a
stout
its
been
pulled
in
a
different
direction
probably
a
bit
too
focused
on
the
chocolate
to
drink
several
but
it
would
pair
exceptionally
well
with
anything
complemented
by
chocolate
such
as
vanilla
ice
cream
or
raspberries
requires
a
fuller
cigar
with
a
dark
but
mellow
wrapper
it
should
be
noted
that
the
scotch
has
been
dropped
from
the
label
but
porter
is
printed
on
a
tartan
background
recommended
for
nonhopheads
looking
for
more
from
a
porter
but
not
the
burnt
bitterness
of
a
stout
for
me
it
is
certainly
a
positive
bonus
that
this
offering
is
proudly
union
made
by
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
iam
excellent
excellent
porter
pours
chocolate
syrup
brown
with
a
tall
lace
head
smells
peaty
like
a
nice
scotch
a
bit
smokey
and
full
of
deep
roasted
chocolatey
malts
flavor
is
complex
as
the
peat
notes
really
come
through
gentle
coffee
bitterness
creeps
in
at
the
end
to
round
everything
off
feel
is
nice
full
bodied
and
properly
carbonated
this
is
easily
my
favorite
mad
river
brew
ive
had
and
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
enjoyed
this
winter
really
nice
beer
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
smooth
easy
drinking
porter
i
would
have
this
again

a
sixpack
makes
this
a
ridiculous
deal
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
their
dipa
smoke
is
set
to
an
elegant
tune
a
solid
sturdy
brawny
porter
on
tap
at
the
linkery
on
30th
for
san
diego
beer
week
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
foamy
chunks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
however
there
is
a
sludgelike
substance
that
sinks
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
coffee
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
with
a
emphasis
on
roasty
flavors
especially
with
the
malt
and
coffee
a
very
mild
roasty
bitterness
quickly
fades
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
for
me
definitely
worth
a
try
o
nice
porter
despite
the
poor
head
and
retention
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
top
notch
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
a
wonderful
porter
enjoy
with
food
or
on
its
own
dark
in
appearance
nice
brown
nice
carmel
foam
smell
is
complex
smoke
coffee
and
malty
mouthfeel
is
nice
in
and
out
with
some
malty
aftertaste
not
bad
taste
has
a
well
balance
of
flavors
this
is
a
good
scotchish
beer
you
can
almost
taste
a
hint
of
peat
this
is
going
in
my
bq
sause
overall
this
has
its
place
in
the
fridge
overall
this
is
a
superb
porter
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
will
seek
out
to
buy
again
easy
to
drink
yet
quite
flavorful
a
great
combo
this
has
a
realy
complex
mix
of
tastes
does
not
have
the
color
or
flavour
of
english
porter
it
has
an
almost
burnt
but
not
unpleasant
taste
peatmoss
fired
maybe
nice
biteiness
in
the
aftertaste
i
would
not
recommend
to
someone
who
never
tried
porter
before
it
would
not
give
a
true
impression
of
the
style
i
would
however
drink
this
again
the
aroma
was
steep
with
roasted
malts
rich
notes
of
caramel
and
molasses
light
grain
touches
and
a
bit
of
a
herbal
note
persisted
nice
robust
flavor
rich
and
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
a
classic
coffee
and
chocolate
profile
smooth
mellow
and
quite
nice
actually
with
an
easy
sessionability
o
awesome
porter
scotch
porter
this
is
a
smoked
porter
if
i
ever
had
one
no
matter
what
you
call
it
i
like
it
this
was
my
first
beer
from
mad
river
brewing
co
but
i
will
trying
more
this
is
one
of
the
few
brews
where
the
bottled
version
outshines
the
tap
i
was
able
to
compare
both
side
by
side
and
the
bottle
has
more
complex
earthy
and
smoky
elements
that
just
fall
fairly
flat
off
the
tap
which
is
unfortunate
still
a
good
brew
but
the
bottle
is
better
very
similar
to
any
other
scotch
porter
ive
had
so
it
obviously
fits
the
style
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
4
or
5
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
it
definitely
has
good
roasted
and
smokey
flavors
that
are
pretty
well
balanced
with
scotch
draw
not
incredibly
complex
but
ive
yet
to
have
a
scotch
porter
that
strays
too
far
from
the
standard
guidelines
of
the
style
no
bitterness
really
nice
smokey
aftertaste
would
be
great
with
a
cigar
o
i
would
definitely
consider
trying
this
beer
again
because
its
a
unique
blend
between
the
two
styles
and
has
complexities
in
the
smell
and
taste
i
guess
this
should
be
characterized
more
as
a
smoked
porter
than
a
scotch
porter
there
is
the
peat
notes
which
come
with
the
style
but
the
smokiness
and
acidity
in
the
aftertaste
here
just
take
over
the
whole
brew
and
its
all
i
can
remember
pleasant
in
the
beginning
but
id
take
this
pill
with
some
food
next
time
overall
a
complete
mess
but
glad
i
only
grabbed
a
single
pours
a
deep
brown
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
mellow
bourbon
scotch
oak
and
a
roasty
coffee
in
the
taste
bourbon
flavors
stand
out
with
some
oak
notes
and
a
sweet
coffee
roasted
malt
a
boozy
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
bourbon
and
coffee
like
aftertaste
nice
bourbonscotch
presence
but
a
bit
thin
for
what
it
is
although
quite
enjoyable
d
seems
a
bit
like
a
light
a
smoky
stout
the
overly
rambunctious
carbonation
got
in
the
way
of
me
giving
this
a
better
score
very
drinkable
for
the
flavors
involved
and
tasty
too
d
i
like
it
i
like
that
its
not
too
sweet
although
it
is
very
dry
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
of
it
and
id
drink
it
again
very
tasty
and
flavorful
i
could
drink
23
pints
of
it
so
i
think
its
pretty
darn
drinkable
worth
a
try
for
sure
cheers
d
very
good
as
a
person
that
gets
full
very
fast
i
would
only
have
one
but
it
would
be
highly
enjoyable

good

of

almost

of

i
smell

of

a

of

tastes
are

then
a
touch
of
smoke
and
a
somewhat
bitter
coffee
finish
pretty
damn
good
find
in
the

mouthfeel

decent

is

good
and
i
really
wish
i
wouldve
picked
up
more
than
one
i
bought
this
as
a
single
and
the
bottle
only
notes
that
it
is
a
porter
albiet
with
the
label
showing
a
scottish
tartan
design
under
the
word
porter
perhaps
that
should
have
been
my
clue
even
without
knowledge
that
this
was
sort
of
a

crisp

why
is
this
beer
and
this
company
not
getting
the
props
is
it
a
scotch
or
is
it
a
porter
its
more
reminiscent
of
founders
dirty
bastard
than
a
porter
for
this
style
but
i
just
cant
see
drinking
a
6er
of
this
in
a
night
its
not
a
bad
beer
dark

the
taste
of

comes
in
with
all
thats
going

with
the
taste
bittersweet
chocolate
character
coating
the
palate
a
nice
beer
almost
imperial
a
nice

and
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
smoky
twist
on

something
i
could

of

on

overall
to
the

seems
very

nice

nothing
really
off
here
i
actually
thought
it
could
have
used
a
tad
more
flavor
or
the
smokiness
i
know
it
might
be
too
much
for
some
people
but
i
just
think
it
adds
a
cool
flavor
profile
to
a
beer
anywho
with
spiciness
that
reminded
me
of
asian
foods
felt
tingly
in

was
i
wrong
an

great
beer
the
only
thing
it
lacks
is
carbonation
and
a
decent
head
other
than
that
some
coffee
and
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
left
on
the

very

with

feels

in

im
not
sure
why
this
is
called
a
scotch
porter
but
its
very
well
made
and
i
will
have
to
pick
up
a
sixer
the
next
time
i
see
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
phenomenally
active
with
its
lively
carbonation
the
beer
swells
with
moderate
intensity
and
is
just
short
of
being
overly
prickly
the
fact
that
it
remains
so
restrained
in
its
effervescence
for
the
entire
duration
is
a
plus
it
doesnt
really
ever
quit
i
could
session
this
and
i
would
if
it
were
more
available
here
in
nj
thanks
to
ego
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
bottle
ill
save
the
other
one
for
another
rainy
cool
night
while
this
beer
isnt
a
standout
its
worth
a
try
on
a
rainy
day
great
drinkability
in
this
beer
a
really
great
tasting
and
drinking
porter
not
bad
quite
good
d
an
excellent
take
on
a
classic
american
style
could
use
a
bit
of
taming
on
the
alcohol
presence
and
carbonation
but
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
a
damn
tasty
beer
maybe
the
scotch
part
is
over
stated
but
aside
from
that
this
is
a
nice
little
find
did
i
buy
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
for
99
cents
i
certainly
did
stands
up
like
a
champ
with
my
favorite
porters
in
part
because
it
goes
off
the
reservation
by
advertising
itself
as
a
scotch
porter
and
then
rolls
toward
smoked
porter
nifty
nifty
beer

very

trace
of
lingering

good

very
very
drinkable
beer
i
am
almost
gulping
it
down
to
enjoy
it
well
worth
trying
on
a
regular
basis
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
porter
not
really
at
all
like
a
normal
american
porter
more
like
a
british
style
porter
this
isnt
overly
dark
in
color
more
of
a
lighter
brown
color
the
main
flavor
is
much
more
malty
than
hoppy
and
it
has
a
smokey
like
finish
to
it
that
is
quite
subtle
and
nice
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
moderate
tannish
chunky
head
nice
lacing
noted
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
fruit
taste
starts
off
roasty
and
coffeelike
but
a
strong
dryness
begins
to
show
through
finish
is
on
the
very
dry
side
and
is
a
bit
too
strong
because
it
completely
overpowers
any
malt
taste
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
revisit
this
beer
is
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
smell
is
chocolate
and
to
a
smaller
degree
hops
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
several
things
chocolate
oatmeal
and
a
nice
slight
alcohol
finish
the
mouthfel
is
fairly
smooth
and
the
head
is
lasting
the
head
is
like
that
of
marshmellow
on
hot
chocolate
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
a
good
porter
pours
oily
black
with
a
finger
or
two
of
rocky
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
skim
nose
is
rich
and
earthy
with
smokey
peat
oaky
vanilla
and
roasted

malt
taste
follows
with
the
dark
earthy
notes
caramel
malts
espresso
and
chocolate
and
a
solid
bourbon
kick
in
the
finish
definitely
some
wee
heavy
in
this
american
porter
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
a
tasty
little
bargainbin
surprise
here
glad
i
took
the
chance
pretty
quaffable

for
its
strength
nice
subdued

very
much
reccomended
dark

with

edges
below
a
large
and
creamy
head
of
light
tan
foam
aromatics
of
rich
malts
waft
upward
providing
scents
of
chocolate
cocoa
roast
and
a
slight
hint
of
smoke
a
very
lovely
aroma
bordering
on
incredible
in
the
flavor
a
unique
blend
of
rich
malts
provides
a
chewy
body
and
a
lovely
profile
of
chocolate
fruit
cocoa
and
a
slight
element
of
smoke
a
tasty
surprise
rich
chocolate
aroma
along
with
a
slight
smokiness
and
lots
of
sweet
dark
fruit
notes
that
i
find
quite
appealing
a
black
body
supports
a
thumb
thick
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
fore
is
smooth
and
chocolatey
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
dried
cherries
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
very
nice
subtle
in
intensity
but
with
good
range
this
beer
had
good
promise
at
the
beginning
but
just
never
really
delivered
anything
else
except
an
ok
porter
this
is
worth
trying
but
not
anything
really
special
this
is
a
very
good
brew
but
perhaps
a
little
too
much
for
me
tonight
as
a
single
this
would
be
much
better
the
hops
just
dont
feel
right
i
normally
could
drink
good
porters
allnight
long
but
id
be
hard
pressed
to
do
it
with
this
one
despite
this
its
still
a
very
good
brew
just
minimally
sessionable
scotch
porter
now
this
sounds
interesting
pours
a
whoa
four
finger
light
brown
head
over
a
black
liquid
small
ruby
edgings
when
held
to
light
smells
chocolate
soured
caramel
and
soured
citrus
some
black
patent
and
a
hint
of
woody
smoke
taste
starts
with
smoked
chocolate
thats
tempered
by
a
middle
milk
sweet
kick
and
finishing
with
a
roast
grain
dry
wow
what
a
transition
there
was
alot
going
on
in
that
first
taste
that
i
didnt
capture
in
words
id
like
to
add
west
coast
hops
cascade
as
a
base
flavor
that
persists
through
most
of
the
beer
and
a
nice
caramel
undertone
that
appears
late
and
persists
as
an
aftertaste
this
caramel
keeps
the
roasty
finish
from
being
too
much
and
id
say
the
roast
turns
the
caramel
into
more
of
a
toffee
flavor
yes
i
now
see
chocolate
as
part
of
the
aftertaste
yum
this
beer
is
wonderful
mostly
dark
and
heavy
but
with
a
lactose
or
oatmeal
lightness
edge
like
rounding
a
brooding
beethoven
piece
with
a
hint
of
mozart
frivolousness
mdlight
body
but
coats
the
inside
of
the
mouth
moderate
carbonation
that
works
well
with
the
roast
an
enjoyable
beer
that
im
happy
to
recommend
carbonation
levels
are
just
about
perfect
and
a
silky
smooth
finish
tops
everything
off
i
would
almost
call
this
a
session
beer
if
the
alcohol
content
was
a
little
lower
definitely
worth
seeking
out
mad
river
steelhead
scotch
porter
is
designated
as
a
smoked
beer
note
since
changed
to
an
american
porter
prior
to
popping
the
cap
i
wondered
whether
it
would
be
more
scotch
ale
porter
or
smoked
beer
conclusion
its
a
porter
and
a
damn
good
one
its
bursting
with
flavor
and
is
more
complex
than
most
recommended
oh
theres
a
thick
smokey
bite
chased
by
a
nice
bitterness
polite
but
still
assertive
the
fruit
comes
across
quite
sweet
like
ripe
bing
cherries
theres
a
full
and
long
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
cloy
this
is
sweet
rich
and
juicy
very
good
overall
comments
a
really
nice
smooth
brew
without
a
single
detrimental
thing
i
can
say
against
it
chocolate
lovers
get
out
your
ice
cream

were
makin
floats
cheers
to
chaz
all
in
all
passable
but
with
the
lighterthanexpected
body
i
ended
up
somewhat
disappointed
with
its
moniker
i
wanted
something
more
full
and
complex
appearance
is
beautiful
black
with
a
dense
tan
head
smells
of
cocoa
dark
chocolate
and
smoke
it
has
an
astringent
aftertaste
which
im
not
fond
of
and
more
hops
than
i
would
like
tastes
more
like
a
stout
than
a
porter
whatever
a
scotch
porter
is
decent
mouthfeel
but
its
marred
by
that
overly
astringent
aftertaste
i
like
drinking
scotch
and
all
so
its
not
that
its
simply
too
harsh
for
me
but
rather
that
its
too
astringent
and
bitter
to
fit
this
style
decent
drinkability
though
inspite
of
that
pours
pitch
black
with
a
halfinch
khakicolored
head
that
has
some
staying
power
nice
aroma
of
rich
roasted

and
some
peaty
smoke
palate
is
dominated
by
smoky
malt
with
notes
of
espresso
and
caramel
and
a
touch
of
hops
body
is
a
little
thin
but
still
pretty
rich
probably
couldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
but
a
good
beer
overall
less
agressive
than
other
smoked
beers
which
in
my
opinion
is
a
definite
plus
it
doesnt
have
the
beef
jerky
taste
that
puts
me
off
most
other
beers
in
the
category
a
tiny
brown
head
dies
in
twenty
seconds
the
beer
is
dark
dark

the
smell

of
roasted
malts
is
what
first
filled
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
with
a
smokey
flavor
and
hints

over

by
a
bittersweet

aspect

of
the
latest
trend
to
add
scotch
or
bottles
in
or
with
wood
or
bourbon
i
tasted
the
scotch
the
porter
part
was
not
great
there
was
smoke
but
it
subtracted
also
letdown
like
the
unibroue

with

intensely
roasted

perhaps
moreso

quality
this
porter
seems
to
have
a
sweet
coffee
quality
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
warming
and
a
solid
full
mouthfeel
its
rich
tasty
and
very
smooth
relatively
low
hoppiness

still

a

the
rochester

the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
fades
to

the
aroma
is
good
it

scent
that
is
dry

a

grainy
the
taste
is
good
it

roasted
barley
it
is
dry

a
good
drinker
just
goes
to
show
you
that
seasons
dont
mean
a
thing
when
it
comes
to
just
having
a
good
beer
and
believe
me
this
is
one
having
one
right
now
as
i
write
this
looks
great
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
tannish
head
and
a
dark

aroma
is
chocolate
caramel
and
a
woodsy
smokiness
seems
to
me
they
managed
to
get
the
carbonation
right
on
this
as
i
experience
no
fizziness
on
my
tongue
as
for
the
flavor
caramel
chocolate
smokey
perhaps
a
little
peat
and
as
it
warms
just
a
hint
of
hoppines
that
melds
perfectly
all

it

this

damn
near
full
and
the
mouthfeel
smooth
creamy
and
enjoyable
all
told
its
a
good
unbalanced
westcoaststyled
porter
but
when
scotch
is
placed
on
the
label
i
expect
it
to
come
to
fruition
and
it
doesnt
really
here
mediummediumfull
body
sits
nicely
in
the
mouth
with
a
vast
amount
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
tingling
your
mouth
on
all
sides
very
nicely
built
easy
as
pie
to
drink
id
like
to
sit
down
with
a
few
of
these
for
a
good
night
if
nutritional
facts
were
on
the
label
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
source
of
vitamin
c
this
is
my
first
brew
from
mad
river
and
i
will
definitly
be
trying
their
stout
next
great
beer
12
ounce
bottle
i
would
not
particularly
stick
this
in
the
smoked
beer
style
more
of
a
porter
no
hops
on
the
flavor
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
i
wish
it
was
a
little
thicker
and
had
a
stronger
finish
good
flavors
to
drink
on
a
cold
winters
nite
just
not
very
strong
a
dark
and
brooding
brown
color
with
a
monstrous
light
tan
head
that
is
semicreamy
in
texture
as
it
slowly
erodes
a
thick
and
sticky
curtain
of
lace
forms
to
seal
off
the
glass
the
peated
malts
add
a
bit
of
muskiness
to
the
nose
backed
by
the
mild
toasted
barley
and
crystal
malts
sweet
fresh
and
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
start
is
sweet
thickly
malt
the
top
is
light
to
medium
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
benignly
acidic
the
hops
perky
in
their
spicy
bite
very
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
and
one
ive
not
sampled
for
1091
days
i
guess
thats
just
a
tad
short
of
3
years
way
over
due
id
say
as
mad
river
is
a
favorite
brewery
just
never
see
this
beer
here
oh
yeah
this
is
one
badass
brew
its
a
scotch
porter
yet
it
resembles
an
imperialold
ale
in
smell
and
taste
its
a
very
dark
amber
almost
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
to
it
it
had
a
smokey
smell
to
it
mixed
with
chocolate
and
subtle
fruits
it
was
creamy
and
coated
the
mouth
very
well
as
well
as
the
throat
the
taste
was
very
nice
too
it
had
the
same
properties
as
the
smell
but
much
more
intense
especially
on
the
chocolate
maltiness
i
guess
if
this
were
a
candy
it
would
be
an
alcoholic
malted
milk
ball
this
is
the
first
steelhead
that
i
have
ever
had
and
if
they
are
all
great
like
this
one
it
wont
be
the
last
definitely
an
interesting
brew
and
highly
recommended
deep
black
color
medium
tannish
foamy
head
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
smoke
roasted
malts
slightly
hoppy
robust
malts
nearly
chocolaty
full
flavor
some
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is

smooth
taste
aftertaste

slightly

booyah
id
rename
this
beer
to
smoked
porter
but
thats
just
me
regardless
almost

smells
quite
roasty

enjoyed
right
at
ground
zero
the
phillips
tasting
room
in
victoria
bc
basically
the
front
of
the
brewery
a
dark
brownish
black
brew
with
a
faint
yellow
halo
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
a
smattering
of
khaki
head
aroma
was
rather
fruity
for
such
a
dark
brew
with
some
currant
notes
along
with
the
expected
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
palate
is
initially
bittersweet
chocolate
truffle
vanilla
and
medium
roast
coffee
but
this
evolves
over
the
course
of
sips
with
some
additional
fruit
roll
up
peanut
butter
and
caramel
notes
appearing
gets
sweeter
as
you
go
really
body
is
quite
light
and
drinkable
truth
be
told
with
a
smooth
creaminess
and
a
semidry
finish
full
of
cacao
powder
fantastic
dessert
beer
that
had
to
overcome
some
of
my
special
ingredient
biases
to
earn
these
ratings
solid
english
porter
base
with
a
tasteful
yet
assertive
layering
of
sweet
flavors
i
dont
love
it
and
i
dont
hate
it
i
dont
regret
trying
it
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
prost
lampertland
there
are
some
classic
porter
elements
here
but
they
are
too
weak
and
not
really
carrying
well
the
cocoa
addition
comes
off
more
as
a
medicinally
sweet
addition
than
adding
anything
really
interesting
to
the
beers
profile
its
porterhouse
truffle
stout
in
that
its
thin
one
note
but
still
tasty
easy
as
od
very
underwhelming
especially
considering
the
inviting
aroma
nothing
too
special
going
on
and
while
it
held
a
decent
chocolate
flavour
it
feel
short
by
a
fair
bit
of
what
it
could
have
done
definitely
a
decent
effort
by
phllips
and
deserving
of
the
price
point
particularly
considering
others
in
its
class
may
rival
some
of
the
better
english
brands
even
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
the
style
its
aroma
will
invite
you
in
for
a
beer
or
ten
and
youll
be
dutifully
punished
in
the
morning
m
light
to
medium
body
creamy
light
carbonation
oa
very
enjoyable
beer
paired
it
with
some
amazing
taco
goodness
from
tres
carnales
in
edmonton
it
is
a
bit
one
note
with
the
chocolate
and
i
dont
know
that
ill
seek
it
out
again
unless
im
in
the
mood
for
something
so
chocolatey
a
very
good
chocolate
porter
by
phillips
brewing
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
a
decent
chocolate
flavoured
porter
a
little
disappointed
by
the
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
is
pleasant
and
the
aromas
smell
delicious
far
below
my
phillips
standards
for
sure
pretty
average
stuff
from
an
above
average
brewery
i
normally
love
a
good
porter
or
stout
and
the
idea
of
chocolateflavoured
beer
really
appeals
to
me
and
this
beer
is
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
there
was
something
about
the
very
strong
hints
of
chocolate
in
this
one
that
were
almost
too
much
for
me
i
dont
think
i
have
much
of
a
sweet
tooth
when
it
comes
to
my
beers
so
sadly
this
one
wasnt
a
favourite
very
delicious
but
i
cant
drink
650ml
of
this
one
in
one
sitting
and
enjoy
it
to
the
fullest
extent
which
i
should
be
able
to
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
im
still
chasing
that
dragon
an
enjoyable
porter
still
with
some
depth
always
good
to
see
more
decent
porters
on
the
local
shelves
its
a
style
that
tends
to
get
shorted
o
good
smell
and
taste
but
could
have
a
better
mouth
feel
drinkability
very
good
i
would
usually
associate
these
flavours
with
richer
beers
but
this
is
still
enjoyable
excellent
for
sipping
after
a
meal
especially
if
you
wanted
something
sweet
but
not
too
rich
say
summer
patio
sunset
dessert
overall
just
like
the
name
says
chocolate
porter
and
it
delivers
on
that
part
the
longboat
is
barely
detectable
but
im
sure
its
there
d
the
chocolate
aspect
is
delicious
but
the
corn
like
taste
is
always
there
which
takes
away
from
the
porter
flavours
i
am
looking
for
but
still
very
tasty
and
drinkable
i
support
being
creative
and
experimental
but
whose
idea
was
it
ot
dump
a
bunch
of
hersheys
syrup
in
what
may
have
been
a
decent
beer
very
disappointing
i
dont
do
drain
pours
but
if
i
did
i
would
have
not
at
all
enthused
about
finishing
this
pours
a
dark
brown
couple
fingers
of
tan
head
body
is
not
opaque
some
burgundy
and
ruby
red
shades
come
through
in
better
light
light
retention
and
lace
cocoa
and
milk
chocolate
in
the
nose
subtle
hint
of
some
roastsmoke
in
the
malt
maybe
taste
wasnt
as
nice
a
watery
cocoa
flavour
was
all
that
i
could
get
lacks
body
and
thickness
flavour
limited
to
the
mild
cocoa
and
milk
chocolate
mouthfeel
needs
improving
higher
carbonation
than
i
wouldve
liked
but
drinkability
was
ok
d
pretty
tasty
offering
from
phillips
and
i
would
purchase
again
given
the
opportunity
the
sourness
was
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
but
not
enough
to
ruin
the
experience
well
made
good
tasting
satisfying
but
nothing
stands
out
from
the
hundreds
of
other
micro
cocoa
porters
out
there
i
havent
had
many
porters
yet
as
i
have
found
them
too
strongunpalatable
however
i
was
feeling
daring
and
picked
this
one
up
as
i
like
phillips
brewery
very
much
poured
thick
and
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
lovely
aroma
of
chocolate
sweetness
not
too
heavy
with
a
medium
body
strong
taste
of
chocolate
a
bit
artificial
but
whatever
throughout
and
a
smooth
satisfying
finish
if
you
see
this
in
your
local
liquor
store
pick
one
up
even
if
you
dont
typically
drink
porters
youll
thank
me
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
disappeared
quickly
a
sweet
smell
of
chocolate
milk
and
cocoa
dominates
the
body
of
this
is
way
too
light
for
a
porter
there
is
a
watery
cocoa
taste
did
not
appeal
to
me
at
all
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
dont
think
ill
buy
this
again
as
an
aside
my
review
is
probably
somewhat
more
to
the
negative
because
of
these
vegetal
notes
something
that
particularly
bugs
me
and
may
not
be
noticed
by
everyone
body
is
pretty
thin
medium
lasting
finish
nothing
about
this
beer
is
very
exceptional
except
the
price
i
paid
for
it
beer
in
general
is
much
more
expensive
in
canada
and
id
rather
have
spent
the
money
on
a
world
class
rogue
or
stone
d
it
wasnt
until
i
returned
from
my
trip
that
i
saw
the
word
flavoured
between
chocolate
and
porter
somewhat
dismayed
i
let
this
gradually
work
its
way
to
the
back
of
the
refridgerator
over
a
period
of
two
months
i
have
to
admit
though
this
was
vey
tasty
and
quite
refreshing
this
beer
pours
a
dark
blackbrown
with
a
very
light
cream
coloured
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
leaving
not
too
much
in
terms
of
lacing
smell
is
of
rich
creamy
milk
chocolate
with
hits
of
coffee
and
caramel
to
boot
taste
is
very
chocolatey
up
front
with
some
nice
roastiness
in
the
background
and
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
light
touch
of
crisp
carbonation
to
help
cleanse
the
palate
i
love
this
beer
ive
had
it
many
times
before
and
will
continue
to
to
enjoy
it
its
so
easy
to
drink
and
always
provides
for
a
soothign
chocolatey
experience
try
it
with
some
grilled
steak
you
wont
regret
it
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
full
and
milky
great
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
almost
like
a

huge
billowing
head
of
tan
fan
that
shrank
away
fairly
quickly
thin
streams
of
bubbles
no
lacing
to
speak
of
it
has
the
smell
of
some
bitter
chocolate
slightly
fruity
and
earthy
the
taste
was
good
malty
earthy
the
chocolate
flavor
was
not
very
strong
the
body
was
thinner
and
lighter
then
expected
i
found
myself
wanting
more
flavor
kick
creaminess
anticipating
a
really
powerful
double
very
drinkable
my
pint
was
gone
before
i
knew
it

almost
nothing

very

okay
but
the
flavour
is
very

good

easy
enough

drink
at
barely
5
i
could
see
having
a
couple
of
these
at
a
sitting
flavor
is
decently
chocolately
yet
light
and
modestly
refreshing
very
black
with
fluffy
soapy

and
soft
lace
medium

and
malt
aroma
much
too
overcarbonated
with
fizzy
carbonation
medium
at
best
mouthfeel
certainly
chocolately
but
drying
finish
chocolate
aftertaste
i
think
better
if
on
cask
at
volo
this
was
a
fairly
easy
drinker
but
not
nearly
as
full
or
intensely
flavoured
as
i
was
anticipating
my
recent
if
a
tad
unfair
comparison
being
rogues
chocolate
stout
somewhat
underwhelming
also
after
my
initial
exposure
to
phillips
admittedly
hopforward
brews
poured
with
a
very
very
dark
brown
color
and
little
foam
looking
a
lot
like
a
coke
with
lots
of
bubbles
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
milk
chocolate
powder
mix
and
some
ashes
tasting
it
my
first
impression
was
how
thin
the
body
was
for
an
english
porter
compared
to
for
instance
the
excellent
fullers
london
porter
or
youngs
double
chocolate
then
came
the
chocolate
notes
and
at
the
end
the
ashes
there
was
also
some
weird
sweet
smellflavour
reminding
me
of
the
stuff
they
use
for
desinfection
at
hospitals
a
grave
disappointment
considering
my
previous
experience
with
phillips
beers
bottled
sample
via
oakes
near
black
in
colour
with
red
hints
and
medium
carbonation
singleminded
aroma
of
chocolate
syrup
it
really
reminds
me
of
quick
loads
of
milk
chocolate
flavor
with
a
touch
of
fruit
and
a
finish
of
roasted
nuts
and
black
patent
malt
some
sweetness
at
the
start
but
the
palate
gets
watery
and
thin
quite
quickly
so
not
much
body
to
speak
of
it
dries
out
way
too
fast
as
well
overall
everything
starts
off
well
but
the
followthrough
is
weak
clear
dark
brown
with
chestnut
highlights
a
vigourous
pour
produced
about
an
inch
of
fizzy
tan
foam
that
fell
quickly
to
a
ring
just
a
little
lacing
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
cocoa
roast
burnt
and
light
caramel
not
bad
at
all
the
flavour
is
all
kinds
of
wrong
especially
compared
to
the
aroma
fairly
sweet
with
little
balancing
bitterness
the
major
flavour
component
seems
to
be
tart
cherries
that
are
dominant
from
beginning
to
end
theres
not
much
in
the
way
of
chocolate
roast
or
malt
here
but
as
it
warms
these
qualities
become
barely
apparent
the
bodys
strange
as
well
with
not
much
heft
up
front
but
a
little
syrupy
in
the
finish
the
carbonation
is
rough
as
well
giving
it
a
bit
of
soda
character
what
a
peculiar
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
aroma
which
was
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
the
flavour
seems
like
it
belongs
to
a
completely
different
beer
its
not
terrible
but
not
something
id
have
again
thanks
wintermute
drinkability
is
good
nice
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
that
id
love
to
have
available
locally
aromas
of
chocolate
espresso
mingle
with
wine
and
ripe
fruit
taste
is
complex
blend
of
cocoa
charcoal
winey
notes
and
hints
of
bready
and
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
slick
with
some
fine
effervessence
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
brew
that
left
you
longing
for
more
it
was
a
long
swim
to
shore
but
i
did
think
about
stealing
a
tender
bottle
poured
a
black
color
ale
with
a
medium
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
chocolate
is
subtler
the
name
of
the
beer
would
suggest
taste
is
drier
then
expected
i
was
expecting
more
sweet
chocolate
then
anything
else
body
is
about
average
but
lack
the
creamy
texture
that
would
have
made
this
a
great
beer
definitely
not
one
of
my
favourite
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
brewery
i
guess
when
i
see
the
words
double
chocolate
i
cant
help
but
get
excited
this
isnt
bad
but
it
is
no
competition
for
youngs
i
think
with
a
few
adjustments
this
could
be
outstanding
a
good
first
impression
of
phillips
cheers
to
elricorico
for
the
bottle
i
hope
to
see
this
on
tap
again
d
awesome
really
between
4
5
and
5
but
since
i
skimped
on
the
taste
score
ill
give
it
another
nudge
here
2
yes
its
charged
with
chocolate
and
yes
it
has
a
distinctive
finish
however
neither
element
is
really
a
positive
if
youre
going
to
make
a
chocolate
porter
i
would
suggest
going
for
a
real
london
style
one
that
has
a
dry
roasty
almost
smoky
finish
you
know
coke
fired
malts
and
the
like
and
then
use
some
nice
dry
bakers
chocolate
to
give
you
that
dry
chocolatey
finish
you
are
purportedly
going
for
because
if
that
is
precisely
what
was
being
aimed
for
this
beer
fails
miserably
all
in
all
this
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
expected
to
drink
well
done
phillips
all
in
all
this
isnt
really
that
much
like
a
porter
so
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
this
is
the
wrong
place
the
brewers
intent
was
obviously
to
be
strong
on
chocolate
in
the
name
it
does
say
double
chocolate
porter
and
i
think
in
that
respect
theyve
created
a
fantastic
beer
the
label
promises
big
chocolate
notes
and
alas
what
is
inside
does
not
deliver
i
found
this
too
thin
for
my
tastes
and
not
moca
enough
drinkable
but
not
memorable
compare
to
the
spy
porter
from
tree
and
you
can
see
the
difference
a
strong
midbody
can
make
in
this
style

overall
a

english

very
nice
pretty
good
but
it
doesnt
bowl
me
over
looks
ok
though
the
head
doesnt
hang
around
for
long
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
pleasant
dominated
by
roasted
grain
and
fruity
malt
intriguingly
the
aroma
is
rather
muted
body
is
alright
a
wellcrafted
porter
but
a
tad
underwhelming
perhaps
this
bottle
is
just
too
old
ill
try
and
rereview
at
some
point
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
pours
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
hard
to
tell
if
its
cloudy
but
the
beer
looks
pretty
clear
in
the
light
nice
glowy
color
medium
tan
head
lots
of
fine
bubbles
after
a
few
minutes
theres
still
a
decent
film
of
bubbles
im
getting
chocolate
maltiness
as
the
primary
flavor
in
the
aroma
but
its
backed
up
by
a
mix
of
fruit
nutty
brown
malt
caramel
molasses
light
coffeeroast
and
a
hint
of
wood
theres
a
lot
of
malt
complexity
to
this
beer
very
nice
toasty
malt
notes
a
rather
rich
aroma
for
5
abv
the
flavor
is
a
touch
weaker
for
me
the
malt
complexity
is
still
there
but
some
of
the
rich
sweetness
is
gone
it
starts
out
with
a
fairly
simple
sweetness
before
bringing
in
some
nice
fruity
flavors
and
takes
its
time
pulling
out
the
chocolate
and
roast
good
finish
with
roast
tobacco
and
earth
hops
lingering
for
some
time
mouthfeel
is
smooth
drinks
big
for
the
abv
british
brewers
know
how
to
pack
flavor
into
lower
abv
beers
sits
a
bit
light
on
the
palate
though
not
the
best
impersonation
of
cask
mouthfeel
for
a
bottled
beer
that
ive
found
but
its
always
a
losing
effort
and
its
still
nice
this
is
an
enjoyable
porter
with
lots
of
rich
british
malt
flavor
in
a
relatively
small
package
i
would
love
to
see
more
american
brewers
make
a
serious
effort
with
this
sort
of
beer
o
its
a
zesty
porter
complex
in
flavor
so
much
so
that
it
would
probably
be
awesome
if
bottled
and
aged
this
is
a
massive
beer
for
only
being
4

big
roasted
barley
flavor
creamy

sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
touch
of
smoke
leather
and
coffee

bit
of
earthy
bitterness
on
the
back
end
layers
of
complex
flavor
faint
woodyness
finishes
a
little
burnt
and
bitter
starts
semi
sweet
with
some
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
one
of
the
biggest
flavored
low
abv
beers
ive
ever
had
pretty
good
o
a
really
tasty
porter
the
malt
character
is
pretty
complex
and
is
well
balanced
by
the
dry
vinous
flavors
its
also
very
drinkable
and
has
scores
some
cool
history
points
i
enjoyed
this
one
o
a
great
porter
and
one
that
definitely
needs
to
be
tried
research
led
me
to
this
beer
and
i
was
amused
by
the
novelty
of
the
name
several
years
ago
since
then
i
have
only
found
it
twice
which
is
unfortunate
because
it
truly
is
a
great
beer
o
really
good
english
porter
with
high
drinkability
one
of
the
best
but
understandably
pricey
slainte
as
an
aside
i
did
very
much
appreciate
the
bottle
which
was
quite
informative
it
reveals
how
the
beer
is
brewed
with
14
malts
exactly
what
to
pair
it
with
and
precisely
how
to
store
and
serve
the
beer
store
in
58
then
refrigerate
for
30
minutes
before
serving
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
though
perhaps
a
bit
heavy
on
the
ash
flavors
for
most
palates
appearance
is
a
little
thin
but
good
o
very
good
beer
id
love
to
try
it
on
cask
in
shrewsbury
easy
drinking
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
grain
and
sweetness
good
complexity
but
smooth
just
terrific
o
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
complex
english
porter
they
say
theres
14
different
malts
used
in
there
and
it
shows
drinkability
this
is
way
too
drinkable
amazing
this
is
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
slightly
thin
but
otherwise
a
terrific
brew
d
while
this
is
an
uneven
beer
it
is
oddly
drinkable
all
right
honest
show
of
hands
how
many
initially
tried
this
cause
o
the
name
come
on
i
did
i
thoroughly
enjoy
porters
teehee
anyway
it
pours
a
deep
clear
russet
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
raisins
wheat
grass
flowers
and
graham
crackers
the
taste
is
more
robust
with
notes
of
light
molasses
blackened
biscuits
rye
bread
dark
wheat
grass
and
some
light
figs
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
gooey
feel
overall
a
nice
bit
of
english
goodness
something
to
look
for
again
later
on
classic
english
porter
pours
a
dark
brown
but
glints
with
a
ruby
note
when
held
to
the
light
the
offwhite
head
is
about
1
finger
thick
and
composed
of
varying
sized
bubbles
there
is
a
good
roasty
nose
on
the
beer
which
is
quite
indicative
of
the
roasty
flavor
the
flavor
is
quite
dry
and
finishes
with
a
heavy
roast
there
is
almost
no
sweetness
throughout
without
being
excessively
dry
the
body
is
nice
and
creamy
and
at
4
8
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
still
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
had
this
a
few
years
ago
and
i
remembered
there
being
more
possibly
my
tastes
have
just
changed
d
the
vanishing
flavor
and
light
mouth
feel
make
this
passable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
nicely
flavored
easy
drinking
porter
notes
wow
what
a
diversity
of
flavors
the
beer
uses
14
different
malts
and
3
different
hops
truly
an
interesting
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
experienced
hard
to
put
it
cleanly
in
a
categorystyle
as
far
as
taste
goes
definitely
would
try
it
again
although
i
dont
feel
the
flavors
are
great
enough
to
warrant
always
seeking
it
out
and
having
it
available
md
sublime
bottleconditioned
perfection
has
that
old
aleesque
smooth
quality
like
you
can
taste
the
history
in
this
one
a
very
enjoyable
balanced
albeit
boring
beer
i
give
high
marks
for
drinkability
for
a
pleasant
ale
that
one
could
literally
drink
all
day
enough
flavor
and
body
to
hold
your
interest
but
conservative
roast
levels
and
abv
a
true
session
ale
and
brewed
right
to
style
that
said
give
me
a
more
complex
and
robust
meantime
london
porter
any
day
ok
im
bored
the
second
it
hits
my
mouth
its
weak
and
watery
nothing
much
happening
at
all
its
light
and
weak
can
i
say
its
weak
again
body
is
thin
and
watery
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
roast
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
but
this
beer
is
a
big
disappointment
in
a
big
way
not
recommended
not
a
repeat
d
much
worse
than
previous
tastings
makes
me
things
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
batch
highest
marks
for
drinkability
low
hop
residuals
combined
with
low
abv
and
delicious
flavor
make
for
a
trusty
drinking
companion
i
challenge
you
to
find
a
more
sessionable
porter
d
overall
this
is
a
good
easy
to
drink
porter
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
enjoyable
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
worth
a
try
sometime
d
very
good
drinkability
this
beer
would
make
an
awesome
beer
to
have
a
couple
while
chatting
with
friends
d
overall
not
a
bad
porter
but
not
all
that
is
expected
from
the
style
disappointing
based
on
expectations
from
other
reviews
d
because
of
the
light
abv
and
relative
viscosity
of
this
brew
its
very
easy
drinking
it
doesnt
fill
you
up
and
the
taste
of
this
outstanding
porter
warrents
another
drinkability
fantastic
session
beer
when
malts
are
desired
d
very
good
unique
flavorful
and
earthy
would
easily
have
another
would
love
on
cask
the
drink
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
with
vivid
carbonation
that
works
just
fine
a
highly
sessionable
quaffer
im
assuming
this
bottle
has
had
its
experience
shipping
across
the
ocean
and
sitting
in
a
box
and
a
shelf
but
it
still
seems
to
be
at
the
top
of
its
class
for
drinkabililty
subtle
flavor
and
showing
us
what
the
roots
of
the
porter
style
id
love
to
have
this
fresh

england
recommended
pours
a
nice
deep
deep
brown
only
hints
of
cola

coming
through
at
the
edges
a
nice
walnut
head
which
leaves
some
laceing
a
softly
malty
aroma
biscuts
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
soft
and
envelopeing
definately
better
as
it
warms
the
malty
body
rolls
acrossed
the
toungue
hinting
only
hinting
quickly
at
so
many
things
bread
pudding
chocolate
oatmeal
but
its
all
gone
in
a
flash
of
hop
bitterness
and
its
something
different
on
the
next
swallow
its
smooth
and
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
overall
a
good
drinkable
session
brew
perhaps
a
bit
too
astringent
on
the
finish
for
some
but
definitely
an
allround
enjoyable
brew
d
very
drinkable

this
has
great

nice

d
with
good
support
of
microscopic
fizz
the
body
is
fresh
yet
smooth
enough
throughout
but
its
not
as
soft
as
a
milk
stout
or
rich
as
an
oatmeal
stout
or
fullsome
porter
it
has
its
own
rough
edges
and
that
provides
some
extra
enjoyment
to
this
nice
dark
brew
as
anticipated
i
fail
to
discern
which
malt
is
which
in
this
beer
simply
because
the
flavour
is
so
harmonious
that
i
couldnt
even
tell
if
the
claim
of
14
malts
is
anything
but
marketing
strategy
a
goodquality
quaffable
porter
it
is
poured
a
darkish
brown
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
that
slowly
died
and
left
lacings
down
the
glass
a
heavy
malt
smell
in
the
aroma
a
mix
of
some
sweetsugary
malts
and
dryer
malts
like
coffee
roasted
toasted
theres
all
kinds
of
malts
in
here
a
smooth
somewhat
creamy
and
bittersweet
beer
the
malts
from
the
smell
are
in
here
and
mixed
well
theres
chocolate
caramel
toffee
coffee
roasted
toasted
maybe
even
burnt
there
is
even
some
minor
hop
presence
in
the
backbite
with
a
more
of
a
grapefruit
hop
taste
than
citric
the
smoothness
that
the
beer
passes
over
the
tongue
is
balanced
with
a
crisp
dry
backbite
and
i
could
sit
at
the
bar
all
day
if
this
was
the
only
beer
available
d
would
make
a
good
session
beer
as
there
is
nothing
harsh
or
out
of
the
ordinary
about
it
i
found
it
drinkable
but
bland
d
crisp
and
clean
and
satisfying
as
an
imperial
stout
kind
of
guy
this
is
to
me
what
your
allpurpose
everyday
lager
is
to
most
others
could
drink
frequently
and
just
might
this
felt
like
a
porter
to
drink
very
heavy
body
however
i
like
a
porter
stout
on
occasion
but
i
couldnt
take
them
all
night
a
nice
porter
but
not
an
all
nighter
for
me
ultimately
a
very
nice
porter
i
feel
that
a
mild
addition
of
oats
would
help
out
the
textures
and
smoothen
the
beer
out
a
lot
d
pretty
tasty
and
darn
right
drinkable
decent
flavors
slight
bitterness
and
the
thinness
made
this
porter
very
easy
to
drink
what
a
beer
each
sip
i
feel
i
detect
something
different
and
it
just
makes
the
brew
better
from
the
coffee
cocoa
sour
fruit
butterscotch
wow
very
rich
indescribably
smooth
medium
bodied
so
creamy
and
refreshing
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
could
sip
on
these
alll
night
drinkability
im
very
surprised
by
this
finishes
clean
with
no
unpleasant
flavors
involved
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
very
good
nonetheless
if
the
price
tag
was
slightly
lower
this
would
become
a
staple
as
is
i
will
still
look
for
it
i
could
drink
10
of
these
this
is
a
true
english
session
beer
this
really
does
taste
like
a
true
english
porter
the
flavor
starts
with
mellow
dark
chocolate
and
a
slight
sour
tang
as
the
beer
finishes
it
dives
into
dark
malts
with
espresso
and
coffee
notes
and
a
spicy
hops
kiss
this
is
really
a
great
beer
and
very
true
to
style
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
more
often
my
only
qualm
is
the
8
price
tag
but
then
again
im
a
cheapskate
a
very
good
english
porter
and
most
likey
the
second
best
ive
ever
had
batemans
salem
porter
is
still
my
personal
number
one
yum
and
yum
drinkability
after
repeated
sips
it
almost
tastes
belgian
due
to
all
the
off
flavors
i
think
this
one
was
a
bad
bottle
unfortunately
ill
have
a
hard
time
finding
another
any
time
soon
the
taste
is
very
enjoyable
on
the
light
side
for
a
porter
but
interesting
and
engaging
porter
taste
its
smooth
fruity
and
toasty
with
light
chocolate
light
bitterness
hints
of
wine
and
a
pepper
in
the
finish
there
is
a
barely
perceptible
coffee
element
in
the
taste
unlike
the
aroma
its
also
highly
drinkable
d
at
5
00
for
a
bottle
this
would
be
an
expensive
drinking
session
howeverthis
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
this
would
be
a
great
introduction
for
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
porter
for
the
first
time
d
big
malt
flavor
and
a
nice
balance
with
bitterness
a
bit
disappointed
with
feel
i
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
from
the
butt
cask
not
too
filling
to
enjoy
a
gulp
or
a
sip
this
porter
is
opaque
with
shimmering
reddish
hues
at
the
bottom
of
my
pint
glass
good
head
and
solid
retention
big
butterscoth
scent
races
to
the
nose
its
toffeeish
too
it
has
a
very
sweet
taste
to
it
with
the
similar
toffeebutterscotch
flavors
chunks
of
french
vanilla
coffee
make
their
enterence
onto
stage
i
know
the
yeast
is
at
hard
at
work
but
i
cant
determine
which
flavors
it
is
providing
very
very
mellow
overall
i
think
ill
have
another
the
body
is
light
understandable
but
does
fall
with
a
watery
wispy
texture
but
the
smoothness
is
right
on
for
a
typical
english
beer
would
have
loved
to
see
more
astringency
but
for
a
session
beer
its
ok
d
its
too
bad
i
like
porters
and
was
really
hoping
to
like
this
one
too
however
it
is
too
watery
and
too
light
for
my
taste
the
slight
sourness
in
the
taste
didnt
help
either
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
thin
more
english
style
head
thats
a
light
brown
smells
like
darkly
burnt
coffee
with
a
sweet
raspberry
like
aroma
at
its
base
this
beer
has
an
amazing
taste
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
with
a
coffee
like
flavor
and
enough
sweet
flavor
to
undercut
it
kind
of
thick
but
definitely
drinkable
d
a
quite
strongdifferent
flavour
so
not
too
drinkable
notes
one
of
the
better
low
abv
beers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
lively
and
plenty
of
depth
i
could
picture
having
this
with
shellfish
and
creamy
pasta
like
alfredo
or
the
like
excellent
d
so
drinkable
as
only
i
remember
this
ale
being
years
ago
i
found
this
to
be
a
masterfully
malty
ale
w
balance
and
the
kind
of
nuances
you
dont
find
that
often
a
fermented
beauty
for
the
mouth
to
absord
this
is
not
one
to
miss
pours
one
step
below
pitch
black
tan
head
nose
is
malty
and
also
a
real
distinct
edge
of
a
roasted
sugar
that
has
sat
in
the
pan
10
seconds
too
long
and
is
far
beyond
rescuing
coffee
tones
there
when
you
really
linger
for
something
more
flavor
is
nice
and
robust
roasted
attributes
that
dont
hijack
the
experience
feel
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
and
a
decent
liquid
body
i
feel
like
it
is
a
bit
thin
but
overall
it
is
good
the
verdict
is
that
this
is
a
fairly
nice
english
porter
one
to
definitely
sip
and
ponder
due
to
its
fairly
full
body
i
liked
it
pours
a
nice
light
tan
colored
head
that
has
a
great
lacing
the
head
falls
thin
but
doesnt
leave
color
is
dark
with
some
purple
protrudes
when
held
up
to
the
light
smell
is
bready
and
roasted
malts
sweet
and
a
little
sour
at
the
same
time
a
very
nice
light
roasty
flavor
compliments
the
bready
malts
that
fill
you
up
and
make
the
mouthfeel
creamylike
minimal
offflavors
overall
this
is
a
good
english
porter
i
am
glad
to
have
this
locally
d
definitely
too
strange
of
a
flavor
for
me
a
one
time
only
beer
for
this
guy
what
a
pleasant
surprise
the
only
weak
point
of
this
beer
is
the
head
which
pretty
much
never
materialized
and
then
completely
disappeared
whatever
there
was
of
it
the
smell
is
chocolate
coffee
tobacco
molasses
some
berries
and
a
touch
of
hop
but
not
much
the
smell
does
not
do
the
beer
justice
and
is
quite
subdued
this
beer
is
all
about
the
malty
taste
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
very
distinctive
chocolate
malty
caramel
sweet
taste
that
derives
from
the
dozen
or
so
different
malts
used
to
brew
this
beer
you
will
get
some
hints
of
berry
and
toffee
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
largely
watery
with
a
slight
oily
feel
the
aftertaste
is
surprisingly
light
this
is
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
porter
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
this
was
good
the
nose
was
amazing
the
taste
nice
im
partial
to
the
stronger
more
robust
american
interpretations
of
the
genre
but
this
was
one
of
the
tastier
english
examples
ive
tried
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
see
this
working
nicely
with
some
cheddar
anything
cheeseburger
as
well
as
batteredfried
fish
n
chips
or
as
a
great
dessert
beer
with
a
unsweetened
flourless
chocolate
molten
cake
etc
id
definitely
drink
it
again
heck
id
open
another
just
to
smell
it
if
you
get
a
chance
give
this
entire
butt
a
spank
drinkability
is
not
very
good
there
is
a
bite
from
the
sour
vinous
character
and
the
brew
is
somewhat
heavy
for
the
flavors
you
get
out
of
it
not
impressed
the
malt
wins
the
contest
as
it
should
be
try
it
a
good
sweet
middle
and
a
bitter
finish
on
the
swallow
some
great
roasted
flavor
acidic
coffee
and
a
bit
of
cola
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
faint
with
just
a
touch
of
dark
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
licorice
the
taste
is
dark
and
roasty
with
some
odd
indescribable
offflavors
in
there
as
well
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
brew
at
all
pours
a
beautiful
brown
with
a
two
finger
head
smells
chocolate
malty
with
a
balanced
and
reserved
english
taste
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
hits
every
part
of
your
mouth
chocolate
malty
hoppy
good
butt
porter
can
drink
on
a
cold
night
or
warm
afternoon
enjoy
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
tan
head
head
retention
isnt
good
but
theres
a
decent
bit
of
lacing
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
caramel
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
hops
roasted
malt
chocolate
caramel
coffee
and
grassy
hops
are
the
main
things
i
taste
in
this
beer
theres
a
nice
lingering
coffeehops
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
its
smooth
and
slick
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
porter
very
sessionable
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
big
malt
flavor
and
a
good
balance
of
malt
to
bitterness
even
though
i
cant
taste
all
the
malts
specifically
by
reading
the
description
on
the
bottle
i
was
expecting
a
much
bigger
beer
with
vinous
notes
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
cask
even
the
smell
afterwards
after
the
beer
was
completely
poured
into
the
glass
was
sour
and
high
in
acetyl
not
recommended
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
very
malty
up
front
but
never
overpowering
the
flavors
blend
together
for
a
cohesive
yet
constantly
changing
taste
on
the
palate
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
even
some
wood
can
be
found
in
this
ale
there
is
a
slight
dry
hoppy
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
clean
not
very
carbonated
the
only
slight
knock
is
drinkability
since
it
is
a
bit
on
the
the
heavy
side
otherwise
a
very
good
english
porter
notes
given
what
ive
read
from
other
reviewers
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
of
this
but
i
sure
hope
not
i
absolutely
loved
the
combination
of
the
malt
and
tartness
in
this
beer
im
just
going
to
have
to
get
another
one
and
give
it
a
try
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
not
too
thick
or
high
in
alcohol
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
d
nice
for
dessert
on
a
cold
night
entire
butt
feels
great
in
my
mouth
heh
this
is
smooth
and
slick
but
thin
enough
to
drink
in
gulps
this
is
significantly
mellower
than
most
american
porters
and
only
4
8
abv
which
i
enjoyed
this
is
not
a
sipping
beer
rather
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
you
order
up
a
round
or
four
with
friends

if
youre
fortunate
to
find
it
at
a
pub
this
is
a
classic
taste
and
one
that
i
can
wholeheartedly
recommend
to
lovers
of
porter
drinkability
and
notes
this
is
one
exellent
porter
very
unique
in
its
use
of
malts
which
include
pale
maris
otter
lager
wheat
pale
crystal
dark
crystal
dark
chocolate
pale
chocolate
black
roasted
barley
cara
malt
torrified
wheat
amber
brown
and
roasted
oats
14
this
was
one
hell
of
a
beer
probably
the
blackest
ive
ever
seen
this
14
malt
porter
was
just
an
explosion
of
flavor
the
feel
on
the
tongue
was
a
little
too
stingy
for
me
but
going
down
was
pretty
smooth
it
had
a
true
malty
porter
taste
that
was
easy
to
savor
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
well
worth
trying
and
good
on
this
side
of
the
pond
as
well
d
not
to
my
liking
edit
while
still
drinking
this
i
find
that
it
pairs
well
with
some
high
chocolate
melding
with
the
vinous
character
in
the
candy
by
itself
its
still
not
so
good
pours
a
translucent
reddishbrown
color
with
a
fizzy
sparse
tan
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
intense
the
most
dominant
feature
although
not
the
most
intense
is
a
distance
acidity
its
not
acrid
just
slightly
sour
there
are
also
strong
smells
of
malt
chocolate
burnt
and
highly
roasted
malts
smoke
raisins
and
fruit
the
beer
has
a
very
dry
roasted
taste
theres
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
that
comes
out
in
the
finish
there
is
a
mildly
tart
flavor
as
well
very
dry
finish
complex
flavors
and
a
medium
body
nice
history
in
a
glass
highly
recommended
an
excellent
brew
mouthfeel
is
much
thinner
than
i
imagined
goes
down
smooth
with
bubbly
carbonation
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
body
definetly
an
interesting
porter
here
im
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
what
but
ill
have
to
give
this
brew
another
go
round
and
see
what
it
brings
next
time
for
now
i
cant
say
im
terribly
impressed
i
was
totally
amped
to
try
this
beer
and
disappointed
once
i
did
pours
very
dark
brown
with
some
slight
lightening
at
the
edges
and
a
skimpy
head
smell
is
cidery
with
a
ton
of
apple
esters
theres
a
roast
malt
character
underneath
there
but
its
overpowered
by
the
fruit
the
cidery
flavor
is
immediately
apparent
on
tasting
this
beer
is
tight
and
acidic
and
the
cider
note
has
a
sour
note
to
it
as
well
its
not
tasty
and
theres
not
a
roasted
malt
flavor
or
a
hop
flavor
that
id
expect
from
a
porter
at
least
an
american
porter
this
is
english
and
i
do
notice
some
similarities
between
this
and
say
sam
smiths
taddy
porter
i
want
to
like
this
i
really
do
but
i
dont
thumbs
down
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
it
is
moderately
carbonated
a
bit
more
crisp
than
the
american
porters
ive
had
still
wellbalanced
and
highly
drinkable
very
smooth
an
excellent
porter
good
example
of
the
style
the
beer
poured
a
fine
black
with
a
good
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
coffee
the
taste
had
a
bit
of
coffee
bitterness
at
the
start
then
broadened
into
a
rich
malt
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
the
feel
was
wonderfully
thick
and
oily
quite
a
fine
beer
to
finish
the
day
with
the
taste
and
feel
are
robust
without
being
overpowering
im
sure
i
will
be
purchasing
more
of
this
fine
beer
in
the
future
sure
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
and
id
give
it
a
try
again
but
only
to
see
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
there
are
just
too
many
other
porters
out
there
id
rather
treat
my
palate
to
overall
this
beer
was
worth
the
try
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
a
porter
porter
fans
will
like
this
one
drinkability
and
notes

sadly
an
older
sample
but
still
a
solid
drinkable
porter
definitely
the
most
flavorful
sub
5
abv
porter
i
have
had
good
complexity
and
definitely
different
from
what
most
porters
try
to
be
time
to
go
find
a
fresh
sample
drinkability
an
excellent
example
of
a
forgotten
style
kudos
to
the
brewer
for
bringing
it
back
pours
s
deep
brownblack
with
garnet
highlight
and
a
nice
onefinger
offwhite
head
that
dies
to
a
coating
nose
is
complexly
malty
which
can
be
attributed
to
the
14
different
strains
of
malt
a
faint
hint
of
tobacco
was
detected
as
well
like
menthol
cigarette
tobacco
taste
is
typical
for
an
english
porter
malty
some
bitter
floral
hops
along
with
a
hint
of
that
tobacco
couldnt
quite
pin
down
all
those
malts
but
overall
this
was
a
tasty
little
porter
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
which
ive
come
to
expect
from
most
english
ales
but
still
enjoyable
complex
malt
profile
makes
this
one
worth
a
try
i
would
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
its
a
good
drinkable
english
porter
would
be
interesting
to
have
on
cask
a
black
beer
with
tons
of
foam
that
dissipates
after
several
minutes
so
a
pint
lasts
a
while
molasses
in
aroma
and
taste
that
adds
to
the
darkness
nuttiness
carmel
fruitcoffee
grinds
some
roasting
tabacco
all
supported
by
above
average
carbonation
the
original
a
must
try
a
good
looking
beer
with
hugely
disappointing
flavor
very
unimpressive
very
dark
brown
in
colour
with
hints
of
red
aromas
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
lots
of
roasted
barley
comes
through
in
the
flavor
along
with
some
caramel
and
a
touch
of
wheat
a
bit
more
watery
than
im
used
to
but
perhaps
thats
more
in
keeping
with
the
traditional
style
of
porter
solid
but
unspectacular
very
dark
brown
clear
and
nearly
opaque
with
ruby
highlights
the
light
tan
head
remained
through
the
entire
glass
fruity
pearplum
aroma
light
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
flavour
was
also
fruity
but
with
a
thin
maltiness
some
roasted
and
chocolate
moderate
bitterness
the
finish
was
a
bit
on
the
salty
side
medium
carbonation
with
a
light
body
and
an
overall
dryness
very
interesting
beer
quite
different
from
other
porters
thanks
grub
this
is
not
a
wellbrewed
beer
not
drinkable
not
worth
a
damn
really
am
i
missing
something
here
it
was
4
no
thanks
this
is
a
dud
poured
out
a
dark
brew
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
glass
minimal
head
if
any
hints
of
coffee
come
through
with
an
almost
winey
scent
dry

with
minimal
hop

that
finishes
very
cleanwell
done
mouthfeelwhat
mouthfeelvery
unimpressive
and
watery
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
i
could
knock
quite
a
bit
of
these
down
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
and
complex
malt
scent
that
is
derived
from
14
different
malts
it
has
a
black
and
roasted
malt
aroma
with
little
hop
scent
present
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
dry
yet
sweet
malt
flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal
black
and
roasted
malts
with
a
nutty
marris
otter
taste
the
bottle
says
it
contains
oats
that
would
explain
the
dry
husky
feel
this
has
a
complex
malt
bill
to
say
the
least
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
one
tastey
brew
a
great
drinker
drinkability
is
phenomenal
i
would
exchange
my
blood
for
this
an
absolutely
wonderful
expression
of
the
art
a

used
entire
butt
is
nearly
black
in
color
head
is
rather
short
and
lacks
retention
the
smell
is
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
with
an
ample
amount
of
roasted
aromas
in
the
mix
the
taste
is
layered
with
malt
flavors
milk
chocolate
coffee
subtle
fruitiness
and
roasted
flavors
provide
plenty
for
my
palate
to
enjoy
a
slight
bitterness
is
the
only
notable
hops
presence
not
my
favorite
porter
but
one
definently
worth
recommending
highly
recommended
pretty
good
porter
though
i
may
have
gotten
a
bottle
a
bit
past
its
prime
poured
with
little
head
but
decent
carbonation
taste
was
dominated
by
chocolate
coffee
maybe
a
little
toffee
and
the
slightest
bit
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
a
touch
thin
perhaps
from
age
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
id
love
to
get
a
fresher
example
to
compare
plus
you
have
to
love
the
name
oh
yeah
tastes
even
better
than
it
smells
rich
and
dark
flavors
of
chocolate
layered
with
coffee
creamy
vanilla
moist
dark
fruits
oak
and
roasty
malt
sweetness
very
well
balanced
by
a
generous
helping
of
hops
the
body
is
medium
rich
and
softly
carbonated
this
porter
finished
with
a
mouthful
of
bittersweet
roasty
flavors
and
a
tingling
hop
aftertaste
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
a
true
english
porter
drinkability

this
is
an
excellent
englishstyle
session
porter
highly
drinkable
because
it
is
so
interesting
it
leaves
a
big
footprint
of
broadly
ranging
flavors
only
without
any
sign
of
sticky
heavy
or
alcoholic
residue
very
complex
and
a
little
tough
nearly
black
with
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
not
too
much
head
formation
even
with
the
gluggy
pour
caused
by
the
bottle
the
head
disappeared
entirely
too
quickly
to
even
get
a
glimpse
of
it
smell
is
of
black
patent
malts
with
hints
of
sweet
chocolate
there
is
a
nice
toasty
smell
as
well
the
flavor
is
quite
a
contrast
from
the
aroma
the
taste
is
slightly
weaker
than
i
would
have
expected
of
course
the
slight
burnt
coffee
from
the
malts
is
there
along
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
that
seems
to
be
the
conclusion
of
the
initial
flavor
initially
this
hits
me
as
having
very
little
flavor
while
holding
it
on
my
taste
buds
for
a
while
the
flavors
described
above
begin
to
bloom
as
this
one
warms
a
bit
the
flavors
do
start
to
open
up
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
probably
medium
in
my
opinion
and
lacks
that
creaminess
many
porters
exhibit
this
is
very
easy
drinking
as
it
doesnt
work
to
overwhelm
the
taste
buds
and
the
lower
abv
helps
out
as
well
a
decent
beer
but
lacking
complexity
and
the
round
warm
character
of
a
porter
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
and
opaque
has
a
very
small
light
brown
head
but
has
some
lace
the
aroma
has
a
malty
sweetness
with
molasses
undertones
the
flavor
gets
a
good
start
with
some
roasted
malt
character
then
there
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
just
before
a
nice
dry
finish
im
all
for
a
lighter
mildly
flavored
session
porter
on
occasion
but
this
beer
doesnt
even
rise
to
those
minimal
standards
since
i
have
relatively
easy
access
ill
give
it
another
go
but
two
chances
is
all
this
one
gets
entire
butt
is
barely
half
a
butt
poured
nearopaque
black
with
the
thinnest
of
heads
aroma
was
quite
vinous
with
very
faint
roasted
malts
i
did
not
care
much
for
the
taste
of
this
it
was
very
fruity
and
vinous
and
somewhat
watery
which
was
especially
surprising
because
the
bottls
claims
that
it
is
brewed
with
14
different
malts
and
3
types
of
hops
there
was
almost
no
roasted
malt
characteristic
but
that
might
be
the
style
there
was
some
dark
fruit
present
such
as
figs
and
raisins
with
maybe
the
slightest
dusting
of
cocoa
powder
but
again
it
was
all
too
thin
and
weak
to
make
an
impression
on
me
there
was
also
a
very
astringent
acidic
aftertaste
drinakbility
would
be
good
if
you
liked
the
flavor
because
the
alcohol
is
almost
nonexistent
a
friend
and
i
tried
this
beer
along
with
deep
shaft
stout
because
it
made
us
laugh
and
were
cool
like
that
pours
a
really
dark
brownblack
color
with
little
to
no
head
very
strong
aroma
malty
coffee
the
flavor
was
coffee
strong
coffee
maybe
a
little
chocolate
but
definately
some
roasted
coffee
in
there
not
bad
but
it
could
use
a
little
something
else
how
can
one
pass
up
a
bottle
labeled
entire
butt
this
one
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
just
a
shade
off
black
wtih
no
head
at
all
the
nose
is
a
nice
light
roasted
coffee
malt
the
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
nose
mostly
roasted
coffee
with
just
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
in
there
the
flavor
is
nice
because
its
not
too
full
like
a
stout
so
i
know
im
drinking
a
porter
the
beer
is
just
a
shade
thin
for
me
drinkability
is
nice
it
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
definately
drink
a
few
entire
butts
this
is
one
butt
that
does
me
good
most
unusual
for
a
porter
that
is
poured
like
a
glass
ink
absolutely
black
no
head
at
all
nothing
this
isnt
unusual
at
all
for
a
porter
what
was
however
unusual
was
the
mouth
feel
extremely
thin
for
a
brew
of
this
sort
i
like
them
to
be
thick
and
even
a
bit
chewy
north
coasts
old
rasputin
actually
leaves
a
coating
in
your
mouth
which
is
just
delicious
i
like
that
feature
in
a
porterstout
this
stuff
is
really
really
thin
any
how
the
smell
is
good
damn
good
tons
of
malt
and
vanilla
extract
i
saw
where
someone
else
had
written
vanilla
extract
as
well
and
i
must
say
i
strongly
agree
very
nice
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
leaves
a
dark
semisweet
chocolate
after
taste
very
nice
with
the
exception
of
the
disappointingly
thin
mouthfeel
everything
else
was
very
good
indeed
very
cool
now
i
want
to
brew
something
like
it
this
beer
didnt
meet
the
expectation
that
i
had
for
it
i
love
porters
and
after
reading
the
bottle
and
being
eager
this
beer
just
didnt
deliver
i
had
to
fight
to
get
a
head
that
just
barely
coverd
the
top
and
there
was
no
retention
at
all
the
color
was
a
nice
ruby
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
smell
was
of
a
nice
malty
thickness
and
i
was
very
excited
until
i
actually
tried
it
it
was
good
by
all
means
however
it
just
wasnt
what
i
had
expected
the
taste
was
very
carbonated
butt
there
was
no
head
there
was
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
seemed
ver
dry
and
there
was
a
nice
chocolate
and
tofee
taste
it
said
to
serve
at
58degrees
which
i
did
and
i
thought
that
it
might
get
better
as
it
warms
but
it
didnt
i
just
wasnt
impressed
i
probably
wont
try
this
again
though
its
tasty
regardless
i
wish
the
multifacited
roasty
hues
would
have
stayed
around
longer
the
taste
was
of
rich
roasted
coffe
and
malts
very
nice
i
enjoyed
it
the
mouthfeel
was
robust
and
comfortable
and
is
very
drinkable
bravo
this
pours
out
is
makes
a
noticeable
glug
glug
sound
from
the
shape
of
the
bottle
the
label
says
best
before
120404
this
pours
a
jet
black
thats
opaque
as
can
be
not
even
any
colors
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
nice
thick
billowing
tan
head
about
a
finger
thick
and
is
falls
to
nice
covering
with
dark
carbonation
circles
scattered
about
with
foam
around
them
like
atolls
the
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
plums
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
going
on
here
the
taste
is
dark
roasted
malts
and
coffee
with
some
light
fruits
the
mouth
feel
is
very
thin
and
surprisingly
light
which
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
not
bad
first
english
porter
not
bad
at
all
very
smooth
taste
thats
very
well
blended
in
summary
the
carbonation
and
highly
malted
nature
of
this
beer
accomplished
only
the
goal
of
heartburn
and
indigestion
making
me
feel
like
an
entire
butt
for
buying
it

a
deep

quite

to
see

nearly
flat
im
pretty
impressed
mostly
with
the
taste
but
its
not
without
its
imperfections
this
is
a

a
very
good
porter
if
not
1
of
the
best
ive
had
to
date
enjoy
an
amazingly
complex
beer
for
only
4
8
abv
you
could
think
of
this
as
a
session
porter
but
i
think
the
complexity
would
overwhelm
your
tongue
id
love
to
see
what
this
brewery
would
do
with
an
imperial
stout
backwash
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
competes
in
a
tough
segment
and
promises
too
much
smooth
and
very
full
i
wish
i
bought
more
than
one

many

added
up
to
a
unique
flavor
profile
as
noted
on
the
bottle
no
hopping
was
evident
instead
the
beer
offered
up
an
interesting
vinious
aspect
up
front
mildly
roasted
coffee
flavors
with
some
very
mild
charcoal
followed
by
some
acidic
sourness
and
sour
cherry
flavors
almost
like
an
oud
bruin
resolved
with
a
dry
finish
unlike
any
porter
ive
had
before
not
something
i
would
tag
as
a
session
ale
but
an
interesting
diversion
oh
yeah
it
is
what
a
big
ass
body
on
this
one
lots
of
dark
round
maltiness
hits
of
coffee
toffee
and
cocoa
an
oatmeally
like
a
bitter
chocolate
haystack
nobake
cookie
creaminess
and
just
enough
smokiness
to
tie
it
together
some
faint
latent
hoppiness
in
the
finish
just
enough
to
let
you
know
that
a
hop
was
tossed
in
the
kettle
the
word
rich
keeps
coming
back
into
my
head
again
and
again
just
a
handful
of
roasted
malt
shy
of
a
sweet
stout
imo
as
is
a
damned
fine
porter
that
will
find
itself
in
my
pint
glass
quite
often
if
i
have
anything
to
say
about
it
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
poured
very
dark
with
a
nice
off
white
creamy
head
that
left
a
beautiful
lace
the
smell
was
sweet
with
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
was
much
more
powerful
crisp
and
clean
with
notes
of
coffee
toffee
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
the
taste
intensifies
at
the
end
and
is
very
enjoyable
i
got
a
hint
of
some
smoke
not
sure
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
i
hope
this
is
still
on
tap
on
friday
when
i
go
back
a
very
black
porter
allowing
no
light
to
shine
through
creamy
head
settles
down
to
a
thin
slick
oftan
foam
very
stoutlike
in
appearance
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
like
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
not
quite
full
but
pretty
close
to
a
guiness
flavor
is
malty
oats
and
a
dry
bitter
chocolate
this
is
nearly
a
stout
in
my
opinion
not
a
great
one
but
not
all
that
bad
either
surprisingly
stoutlike
for
an
english
porter
dark
and
looks
black
for
most
part
but
closer
inspection
shows
that
its
just
a
really
dark
brown
a
nice
roastiness
jumps
out
at
you
first
a
bit
thin
in
the
middle
and
some
toffee
in
the
finish
hops
are
awol
as
the
label
said
they
would
be
quite
the
tasty
porter
not
on
the
level
of
fullers
london
porter
but
still
nice
reading
other
reviews
me
thinks
my
bottle
might
not
have
been
in
the
best
condition
it
could
have
been
in
it
poured
a
dark
brown
i
found
it
to
be
rather
light
bodied
with
aromas
and
flavors
of
coffee
though
i
found
everything
quite
subdued
and
not
very
interesting
i
may
try
this
again
but
i
am
not
in
any
rush
when
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
had
a
very
small
head
that
quickly
diminished
there
was
no
lacing
present
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
hue
of
this
beer
is
black
the
nose
is
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
strong
roasted
coffee
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
thin
and
somewhat
watery
body
and
mouthfeel
were
thin
and
watery
hardly
the
characteristics
of
the
delicious
baltic
style
porters
i
am
used
to
mild
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
were
discernible
had
an
astringent
alcohol
finish
that
did
not
fit
at
all
again
hopefully
this
went
bad
and
i
would
like
to
say
i
would
try
it
again
but
for
the
price
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
risk
not
surprisingly
a
ton
of
malt
on
the
palate
with
just
a
touch
of
wineyness
again
the
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
dominate
its
quite
light
on
the
palate
and
not
very
long
quaffable
but
ultimately
a
bit
too
maltcentric
to
be
really
interesting
cheers
maybe
this
was
a
bad
sample
although
i
could
not
find
a
date
on
the
bottle
it
did
have
all
the
right
ingredients
it
seems
but
i
just
wanted
it
to
give
me
more
i
could
drink
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
must
get
some
more
of
this
carefully
poured
its
a
clear
deep
mahogany
with
ruby
highlights
the
short
but
creamy
offwhite
head
drops
shortly
but
maintains
a
creamy
collar
and
a
whispy
surface
coating
throughout
the
glass
it
leaves
some
lace
but
its
thin
and
spotty
the
nose
is
cocoaish
lightly
fruity
berries
and
coffeeishchocolatey
with
a
mild
smoky
roastiness
if
you
search
a
little
further
some

and

grassy

goldings
the
body
is
light
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
that
leaves
it
exquisitely
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
displays
a
plumlike
fruitiness
upfront
with
emerging
notes
of
gently
sweet
chocolate
some
more
berrylike
fruit
appears
as
it
warms
along
with
notes
of
toffee
its
well
balanced
with
a
supportive
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
with
a
nutty
caramel
flavor
that
dissolves
into
lingering
roasted
dryness
and
gentle
bitterness
this
is
without

best
enjoyed
at
cellar
temperature

the
change
in

as

warms
is
interesting

this

was

still
a
great
example
of
a
traditional
porter
who
knew
something
with
the

butt
in
it
could
taste
so
good
the

of

almost
make
you

this

has
a

it
says
its
a

once
were

may
account
for

i
prefer

suffers

of
the

as
i
understand
it
some
good
flow
without
a

of
weight
but
not
lacking
either
maybe
it
ends
up
a
little
light
and
fizzy
carbonated
like
a
soda
but
with
a
little
added
weight
to
it
o
a
damn
fine

this
beer
made
me
fall
in
love
with
the
brewery
and
ive
tried
almost
everything
of
their
that
i
can
get
my
hands
on
maybe
im
not

plays
up
toward

does
not

should
but
a

it
was

to
keep

interested

i
have
always

of

was
definitely
was
not

rjt

i
am

to

o

very

perfect
best
porter
ive
ever
had
after
20
years
of
drinking
beer
smooth
smooth
smooth
yummy
i
picked
it
up
because
of
its
unassuming
label
quite
simple
st
peters
also
makes
a
stout
you
must
have
too
ive
only
seen
them
in
specialty
shops
here
in
south
tx
nuff
said
m
balanced
maybe
a
little
extra
bitterness
at
the
end
but
blended
with
the
proportion
of
sweetness
makes
this
one
a
balanced
beer
nice

held
up

sour
smell
smell
isnt
strong
enough
to
warrant
much
opinion
taste
is
very
mild
hardly
much
there
but
what
is
there
is
a
malty
sour
mash
type
flavor
an
ok
beer
probably
better
when
its
fresh
in
england
than
after
sitting
on
a
shelf
for
a
while
o
new
ground
for
me
an
english
porter
that
is
this
tastes
and
drinks
just
like
an
excellent
irish
red
albeit
a
little
less
roasty
poured
from
a
16
9oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
unknown

this
pours
a
dark

which
quickly
dissipates
the

a

too
high
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
english
porter
drink
at
cellar
temperature
keep
in
mind
that
if
youre
used
to
drinking
excellent
uk
porters
such
as
sam
smiths
taddy
porter
or
equally
excellent
american
porters
such
as
founders
or
berkshire
draymans
youll
need
to
adjust
your
expectations
before
drinking
st
peters
the
former
are
big
loud
avuncular
porters
that
offer
a
muscular
and
meaty
handshake
st
peters
on
the
other
hand
is
slender
and
subdued
and
understated
as
porters
go
its
a
great
beer
on
a
lighter
scale
the
aroma
has
enough
roastiness
and
coffee
to
immediately
qualify
for
the
style
but
its
got
the
british
twang
of
hoppy
oranges
without
actually
tasting
like
oranges
its
very
smooth
and
a
tad
thin
but
i
didnt
find
it
so
watery
as
others
have
i
detected
a
touch
of
scotch
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
which
was
a
pleasant
addition
subtle
and
well
worth
the
price
d
this
was
ok
but
i
can
see
the
clear
difference
with
the
meantime
i
had
a
few
days
ago
theyre
just
in
different
leagues
watery
mouthfeel
surprisingly
so
was
hoping
for
something
more
chewy
smooth
complex
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
which
is
not
the
case
for
many
porters
but
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
a
little
on
the
watery
side
but
the
thinner
edge
makes
this
all
the
more
drinkable
carbonation
was
ok
and
it
helped
clear
the
palate
i
like
their
stout
much
better
but
this
was
very
good
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
d
this
beer
has
a
good
session
beer
with
a
great
depth
and
a
nice
subtle
complexity
and
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
i
could
see
this
as
a
session
beer
as
smooth
and
easy
as
it
goes
down
the
only
thing
that
lessens
the
drinkability
is
the
price
ive
been
very
impressed
by
this
brewery
and
look
forward
to
trying
even
more
of
what
they
have
to
offer
drinkability
highly
recommended
as
a
gateway
beer
not
a
bad
drop
reminds
me
of
theakstons
old
peculier
nice
beer
but
st
peters
makes
some
good
but
sort
of
unremarkable
beers
not
bad
but
not
one
of
those
that
i
would
really
be
asking
for
with
any
frequency
drinkability
theres
nothing
better
than
old
school
or
oldstyle
in
this
case
st
peters
oldstyle
porter
is
a
topnotch
brew
i
received
this
a
gift
and
normally
i
would
walk
by
this
beer
in
the
store
but
i
am
happy
i
tried
it
as
it
surprised
me
in
a
good
way
very
drinkable
and
very
nice
taste
with
bread
and
slight
acidic
taste
very
easy
drinking
porter
and
a
great
representation
of
an
old
style
porter
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
something
for
a
chilled
or
rainy
evening
or
even
just
to
enjoy
with
a
good
traditional
fish
and
chips
i
found
it
rather
enjoyable
and
could
see
myself
partaking
of
another
sometime
in
the
near
future
goog
look
head
is
a
solid
cream
color
and
a
black
body
which
turns
dark
ruddy
copper
when
held
up
to
the
light
smell
is
generic
but
still
decent
though
it
is
lacking
intensity
or
complexity
good
roasted
flavour
nice
yeast
character
just
a
solid
porter
flavour
its
a
good
porter
nothing
special
to
note
though
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
still
highly
drinkable
d
very
easy
drinking
smooth
in
flavor
especially
with
a
nice
easy
chocolate
profile
abv
is
very
manageable
the
only
downfall
with
this
beer
for
me
was
that
there
seemed
to
be
something
missing
with
the
finish
if
it
just
could
have
lingered
a
little
longer
on
the
tongue
i
would
have
it
as
one
of
my
favorite
porters
mouthfeel
comes
across
slightly
thin
which
does
this
beer
no
favors
a
bit
heavier
more
substantial
mouthfeel
would
really
finish
this
beer
off
the
way
it
deserves
very
well
done
otherwise
everything
about
this
beer
was
judicious
it
seemed
a
really
nice
alternative
to
big
porters
when
in
the
mood
probably
a
good
summertime
porter
overall
very
enjoyable
i
have
had
just
a
few
oldstyle
porters
and
this
has
been
the
best
drinkability
while
it
is
tasty
and
i
wouldnt
mind
downing
a
few
more
if
someone
else
were
paying
i
dont
think
id
order
another
a
wonderful
traditional
style
porter
with
lots
of
great
flavours
going
on
wonderfully
drinkable
for
a
standard
strength
beer
d
understanding
that
this
is
a
blend
of
an
old
ale
and
a
newer
beer
adds
depth
of
intrigue
for
me
most
notable
though
is
the
depth
of
flavor
and
aroma
if
this
is
how
porters
once
were
then
i
would
have
no
problem
getting
by
in
the

ago

in

way
overall
a
very

brew
its
mildly
complex
but
not
too
much
that
this
beer
doesnt
make
a
bad
session
beer
fore
sure
its
drinkable
but
much
too
easy
while
porters
should
be
smooth
they
should
also
have
some
more
bite
and
bumps
and
bruises
along
the
way
those
are
not
very
present
in
this
brew
suitable
for
drinking
its
a
good
beer
albeit
one
with
just
one
big
character
bold
and
unapologetic
and
surprisingly
drinkable
conclusion
this
is
a

porter
its

quite

soft
and
easy
going
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
of

the

i
say

of

is

take
that
with

you
have

d
a
very
enjoyable
porter
smooth
enjoyable
and
drinkable
worth
trying
out
oh
and
the
foam
doesnt
quite
disappear
as
theres
still
some
spotting
in
what
will
be
my
last
sip
from
my
glass
lacing
is
minimal
drinkability
just
a
tad
light
in
the
body
but
otherwise
a
pleasant
easydrinking
porter
a
welldone
authentic
porter
to
its
roots
this
porter
is
a
blend
of
old
mature
ale
and
a
younger
light
beer
my
first
beer
from
st
peters
a
welcoming
first
impression
on
me
drinkability
a
delicious
full
bodied
porter
that
stands
out
in
all
respects
definitely
going
to
add
this
to
the
regular
lineup
good
atmosphere
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
nose
but
really
stout
similarly
with
the
flavor
fairly
basic
but
good
balance
solid
feel
although
its
almost
too
light
like
its
a
bit
diluted
does
have
prominent
alcohol
feel
great
drinkability
though
really
solid
quaff
cheers
deasy
drinking

but
would
probably
look
for
different

wanted
more

a

but
i
felt
like
it
was

in

for

was

looking
for
dont

take
away
from
the
quality
of
it

would
be

definitely
wouldnt

poor
beer
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
brew
not

full

like
the
american
porter
but
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
go
out
and
sample
the
other
two
styles
by
this
brewery
that
are
on
shelf
at
my
favorite
store
taste
not
nearly
as
round
and
complex
as
the
aroma
bitter
coffee
and
roasted
malts
upfront
this
developed
into
a
muddled
hops
bitterness
in
the
middle
the
finish
was
a
continuation
of
the
bitterness
as
well
as
some
tangy
dark
fruits
and
cream
its
hard
to
say
why
i
dont
love
this
porter
it
is
a
complex
and
flavorful
brew
if
somewhat
muted
does
it
need
more
body
most
beers
this
light
in
body
dont
display
the
array
of
flavors
in

do
i
crave
more
hops
i
dont
consider
myself
a
hophead
but
i
have
come
to
expect
more
aggressive
hopping
i
dont
find
any
major
flaw
in
this
porter
i
just
want
a
little
more
intensity
very
nice
englishstyle
porter
an
unexpectedly
nice
tasting
porter
picked
up
this
brew
on
a
whim
the
other
day
for
the
thanksgiving
holiday
and
just
tried
it
last
evening
i
guess
the
shape
of
the
bottle
is
what
drew
me
to
the
brew
odd
old
type
of
a
bottle
the
brew
it
self
poured
to
a
deep
dark
brown
color
that
was
more
close
to
black
than
brown
but
the
light
that
was
able
to
filtered
through
gave
it
ruby
highlights
the
head
on
this
brew
was
very
small
and
had
a
cream
tan
color
that
left
some
lacing
i
guess
the
lack
of
a
head
could
have
been
due
to
my
careful
pour
maybe
a
little
to
careful
over
all
it
is
a
fair
looking
brew
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
with
highlights
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
along
with
an
earthy
scent
the
taste
had
a
sweet
taste
at
first
then
broke
to
a
stronger
malt
taste
highlighted
by
a
accompanying
hop
taste
that
went
well
with
it
adding
a
degree
of
spice
over
all
it
is
a
pretty
nice
tasting
brew
one
thing
that
i
did
notice
is
that
it
is
a
dry
brew
and
it
also
feels
almost
watered
down
for
a
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
brew
and
one
that
i
would
have
again
but
do
feel
that
there
are
other
better
porter
examples
definitely
am
intrigued
buy
the
bottle
and
would
like
to
try
some
of
the
other
brews
they
offer
the
appearance
and
smell
do
not
reveal
the
taste
of
this
brew
nothing
overly
complicated
but
a
nice
nutty
and
smoky
taste
to
the
malt
smoky
roastes
burnt
malt
flavors
roasted
nuts
and
hints
of
vanilla
lightly
metallic
medium
bodied
very
smooth
porter
and
pretty
unique
to
most
that
i
have
tried
very
good
a
slightly
above
average
porter
not
one
ill
try
again
in
all
honesty
the
bottle
was
what
grabbed
my
attention
in
the
first
place
the
porter
itself
is
nothing
special
an
old
school
porter
from
a
flask
bottle
that
looks
like
it
should
have
patent
medicine
in
it
very
dark
black
just
a
little
light
comes
through
at
the
bottom
dark
tan
head
rises
and
falls
in
a
minute
nice
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
heavy
aroma
malty
but
pruney
with
lots
of
spicing
and
slight
medicinal
qualities
thick
and
chewy
mouthfeel
flavor
is
interesting
in
its
depth
and
layers
more
prunes
fortified
wine
dark
roasted
senses
a
seeming
layer
of
ashy
bitters
at
the
finish
aroma
keeps
backing
up
the
flavors
in
the
mouth
interesting
rendition
lots
of
flavors
to
note
that
imply
more
alcohol
than
is
really
around
reminds
me
of
what
an
historical
porter
may
have
tasted
like
tavern
owners
blending
all
sorts
of
brews
and
even
adding
strange
and
unexpected
flavorings
for
balance
and
color
the
drinkability
is
kind
of
subjective
to
me
its
a
little
different
pass
on
this
brew
and
try
their
stout
its
much
better
a
good
porter
really
enjoyed
it
drinkability

this
is
a
good
porter
that
both
entertains
and
satisfies
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
things
going
on
here
so
have
some
fun
with
it
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
14
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
roasted
chocolate
and
crystal
malts
it
has
an
intense
toastey
feel
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
rich
and
dry
black
malt
flavor
with
a
lingering
grainy
aftertaste
it
has
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
that
would
be
enhanced
it
the
mouthfeel
were
any
better
the
mouthfeel
sucks
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
very
low
carbonation
this
porter
has
good
aroma
and
flavor
but
because
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
the
drinkability
suffers
its
one
and
done
for
me
st
peters
oldstyle
porter
is
a
fine
example
of
the
classic
porter
style
and
is
no
doubt
exactly
what
its
brewers
intended
it
to
be
since
this
is
my
review
though
i
cant
ignore
my
big
beer
bias
as
a
result
ill
have
to
downgrade
it
just
a
tad
for
those
who
like
the
english
porter
style
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
this
is
a
relatively
lame
porter
albeit
one
that
came
in
a
cool
looking
bottle
if
theres
no
good
beer
available
its
a
passable
choice
but
thats
about
it
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
plus
my
wife
likes
the
bottle
they
get
points
added
for
a
classy
and
very
unusual
bottle
this
one
poured
very
bark
allmost
black
with
a
very
large
head
that
got
me
worried
it
had
gone
bad
no
worries
as
the
head
dissipated
to
a
fluffy
off

crown

in

line
of
brews
poured
more
of
rich
tawny
brown
with
not
much
head
just
a
soapylike
semblence
of
one
but
the
nice
rich
color
made
up
for
the
lack
of
headaroma
was
nutty
with
milk
chocolate
presence
as
well
with
just
a
touch
of
coffee
taste
is
the
same
alot
of
nuttiness
with
an
almost
almond
flavored
coffee
drink
flavor
to
itnow
i
have
a
problem
with
the
wateriness
of
this
brew
though
really
thin
i
think
compared
to
american
counterparts
wich
iam
used
to
none
the
less
this
a
easy
drinking
flavorful
porter
with
a
cool
bottle
i
would
buy
again
and
will
the
bottle
is
rather
interesting
albeit
green
its
kind
of
flask
shaped
and
indeed
on
the
back
they
say
its
a
replica
of
a
bottle
made
in
1770
here
in
the
usa
the
mouth
is
a
tad
small
though
and
causes
a
bit
of
excessive
splashing
on
the
pour
nevertheless
the
beer
comes
out
fine
as
the
head
which
is
a
tad
small
is
composed
of
fine
small
bubbles
the
beer
itself
is
a
bit
light
in
color
more
of
a
dark
brown
rather
than
black
which
is
fine
for
some
porter
styles
the
aroma
seems
a
bit
onedimensional
its
all
coffee
roasty
malt
but
thats
ok
in
this
case
the
simplicity
is
nice
and
helps
you
focus
on
the
beer
itself
the
flavor
is
a
tad
bitter
from
roasted
burnt
malts
not
too
sharp
with
a
faint
hint
of
malt
in
the
background
the
aftertaste
seems
to
accentuate
the
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
with
some
slight
astringency
think
tea
but
overall
this
is
pretty
nice
maybe
not
my
favorite
porter
but
not
bad
either
one
inch
of
beige

theres

im
enjoying
the
fantasy
that
maybe
this
is
what
the
original
porters
might
have
tasted
like
better
warm
taste
well
i
would
love
to
say
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
but
i
got
pretty
much
what
i
expected
tasted
much
like
a
guiness
pretty
bland
malty
for
the
most
part
and
not
very
carbonated
however
i
did
get
the
caramel
taste
in
the
coffee
so
that
was
a
plus
mouthfeel
it
was
pretty
light
and
did
not
seem
as
though
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
2
or
even
3
of
these
it
was
not
very
heavy
but
was
okay
i
still
give
guiness
the
thumbs
up
over
st
petes
gotta
love
the
flask
of
a
bottle
too
dark
brown
in
hue
black
in
the
middle
shiny
ruby
around
the
edges
the
color
is
attractive
a
beige
head
topped
the
beer
it
was
a
finger
in
height
on
a
harder
than
normal
pour
the
head
retention
was
fair
after
a
moment
it
faded
to
a
foamy
cap
and
then
to
a
loose
collar
the
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
the
nose
is
soft
it
smells
like
chocolate
milk
with
a
dash
of
coffee
in
it
at
the
back
are
notes
of
astringent
roast
overall
the
bouquet
isnt
very
complex
however
the
smells
are
quite
inviting
then
i
smelled
it
again
after
a
few
moments
and
i
got
a
suggestion
of
tobacco
leaves
husks
and
some
earthy
hops
really
working
to
pick
up
the
details
paid
off
lovely
still
the
potency
is
too
low
the
palate
is
awesome
this
is
a
tasty
porter
it
is
much
roastier
tasting
that
the
nose
leads
on
tricky
bastard
there
is
a
good
amount
of
astringency
charcoal
charred
husks
bittersweet
chocolate
distant
lactose
sweetness
and
earthy
flavors
i
am
deeply
impressed
the
finish
is
long
and
charred
i
bet
this
beer
would
really
match
nicely
with
some
kcstyle
bbq
the
aftertaste
is
equally
long
very
roasty
and
even
a
little
sweet
i
really
like
this
porter
it
is
not
the
most
complex
porter
ive
enjoyed
but
this
is
one
of
the
yummiest
sometimes
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
being
a
straight
shooter
mediummediumfull
in
body
low
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
filling
it
is
a
meal
in
a
bottle
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
agreeable
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
my
dear
girlfriend
tara
bought
me
a
bottle
in
iowa
city
because
she
liked
how
the
bottle
looked
luckily
i
liked
how
the
beer
tasted
recommended
light
bodied
simple
quaffable
and
standard
despite
it
flaws
pours
out
a
dark
brown
black
with
a
short
tan
head
which
quit
too
quick
tastes
nice
and
almost
stouty
but
who
am
i
to
draw
the
line
between
the
styles
nice
and
full
for
the
style
which
i
like
not
a
great
porter
but
certainly
a
solid
one
worth
tasting
if
you
see
it
im
enjoying
the
brew
light
brown
in
color
small
creamy
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
aroma
of
dark
roasted
coffee
and
malts
light
body
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
smokey
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
with
a
light
smokey
burnt
bitterness
in
the
finish
some
what
watery
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
and
a
perfect
session
beer
for
those
with
discriminating
taste
and
a
deep
line
of
credit
this
is
a
decent
porter
and
probably
more
true
to
the
traditional
style
than
others
its
black
with
hints
of
mahogany
and
ruby
its
short
lived
head
gives
way
to
some
nice
belgian
lace
the
flask
style
bottle
is
aesthetically
pleasing
aroma
is
of
a
firm
chocolatey
malt
mostly
with
some
yeast
and
subdued
hop
scents
the
taste
is
of
chocolate
coffee
sweet
malts
and
mild
hop
bitterness
in
fact
most
of
the
bitterness
seems
to
come
from
the
dark
chocolatey
black
malts
rather
than
the
hops
the
carbonation
is
very
light
the
mouthfeel
seems
peculiarly
oily
or
slick
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
and
this
is
an
above
average
porter
will
definitely
try
it
again
conclusion
a
wellcrafted
dry
porter
the
taste
is
very
solid
and
fulfilling
there
is
a
hint
of
coffee
along
with
an
ever
so
subtle
chocolate
quality
it
doesnt
feel
as
smooth
as
it
could
in
the
mouth
but
thats
the
closest
thing
i
have
to
an
actual
complaint
3
69
a
bottle
a
dark
reddish
brown
colour
with
a
mediumthick
creamy
head
it
smell
dark
chocolate
and
pepper
with
some
hints
of
hops
the
taste
is
roasted
and
a
bit
smokey
it
also
have
some
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
aftertaste
is
long
and
bitter
this
is
a
very
nice
porter
and
i
think
it
would
go
very
well
with
a
pice
of
chocolate
cake
drinkability
excellent
i
could
drink
another
few
of
these
easy
very
tasty
ok
the
st
peters
bottles
sell
this
beer
for
me
something
a
little
different
once
in
a
while
is
nice
in
appearance
the
beer
is
an
impenetrable
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
or
lace
with
the
pour
the
beers
flavor
makes
me
think
of
hersheys
dark
chocolate
with
the
bittereness
of
that
candy
i
wish
i
couldve
had
more
but
there
were
three
of
us
sharing
one
bottle
it
pours
black
with
some
ruby
tinges
and
a
tan
head
there
is
some
roasted
malt
aroma
as
well
as
slight
whiskey
and
charcoal
notes
the
body
is
smooth
with
some
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
flavors
and
again
some
slight
whiskey
it
is
nice
to
see
a
porter
like
this
the
beer
after
vamoosing
from
the
unique
green
bottle
pours
a
deep
incarnadine
color
the
head
mediocre
in
size
the
texture
creamy
and
the
irish
lace
pronounced
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
nose
is
a
tad
earthy
somewhat
sweet
fresh
and
crisp
seems
to
be
a
hint
of
peat
start
is
lightly
sweet
nice
malt
profile
the
top
is
fair
to
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
nice
mild
acidity
the
hops
pleasing
in
their
spiciness
quite
dry
and
a
nice
mild
english
porter
one
worth
a
sample
at
least
the
finish
is
satisfying
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
gentle
inviting
on
the
whole
this
simple
ale
comes
across
as
relaxing
and
highly
pleasurable
to
drink
the
aroma
really
came
alive
towards
the
end
although
this
is
a
nice
creamy
beer
the
downside
is
that
this
beer
remains
too
lightbodied
for
the
style
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
containing
rich
qualities
without
being
overpowering
or
heavy
a
little
too
light
bodied
for
my
liking
but
still
the
good
outweighs
the
bad
here
bottle
poured
a
translucent
dark
brew
with
absolutely
no
head
and
no
carbonation
aroma
of
toffee
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
some
toffee
and
some
bitterness
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
very
annoying
and
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
this
beer
also
lacks
a
strong
body
and
the
chocolatecoffee
taste
should
be
more
detectable
overall
a
very
disappointing
beer
that
i
will
try
at
least
one
more
time
to
ensure
that
i
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
appears
black
at
first
but
is
actually
very
dark
ruby
fruity
aroma
vinous
and
unusual
with
caramel
in
there
too
flavour
is
balanced
with
malt
and
fruit
in
the
fore
slight
note
only
slight
papery
notes
from
shallow
carbonation
detract
a
bit
though
im
not
complaning
a
bit
of
citrus
but
mainly
malt
in
the
aftertaste
good
but
not
outstanding
lots
of
muscle
in
this
beer
a
nice
quaff
this
beer
makes
my
list
of
true
winners
im
not
really
a
porter
fan
but
i
liked
the
looks
of
the
bottle
and
thought
that
id
try
it
out
it
pours
a
dark
reddish
black
and
resembles
coca
cola
it
was
a
very
smooth
drink
free
from
the
normal
bitter
aftertaste
that
i
associate
with
porters
it
was
a
pleseant
surprise
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
a
beginners
porter
poured
into
a
glass
it
creates
a
magnificent
thick
foamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
tantalizing
mixture
of
coffee
and
caramel
very
good
roasted
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
finish
is
a
great
balance
between
the
roasted
bitterness
and
a
light
malty
sweetness
also
there
is
a
gentle
hint
of
licorice
i
definitely
could
sit
around
and
enjoy
a
couple
of
pints
of
this
porter
without
any
arm
twisting
drinkability
is
notable
at
least
its
not
laden
with
a
phenomenal
abv
that
one
bottle
later
im
welded
to
my
seat

got

as
it

a
very
nice
offering

dark
color
with
a
great
creamy
head
that
laces
nicely
down
a
pint
glass
smell
had
a
yeasty
lemony
quality
taste
had
elements
of
smoke
lemon
possibly
a
hint
of
chocolate
hop
presence
was
present
but
not
overwhelming
very
drinkable
with
a
decent
body
that
left
a
nice
dry
somewhat
hoppy
finish
very
interesting
flask
bottle
and
label
might
make
a
good
stocking
stuffer
for
porter
fans
this
bottle
reminds
me
more
of
an
old
england
elixer
than
it
does
beer
long
story
short
the
bottle
may
be
cooler
than
the
beer
it
pours
out
very
flat
with
a
very
thin
head
that
quickly
disappeared
it
poured
out
a
very
nice
chocolate
color
the
smell
is
typical
of
porterstyle
beer
full
nutty
taste
fill
your
mouth
immediately
but
are
dont
linger
very
long
my
first
choice
of
beer
is
usually
not
a
porter
but
when
i
have
a
good
one
i
really
enjoy
it
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
has
no
special
qualities
that
would
make
me
run
back
to
buy
another
quite
complex
and
interesting
its
very
dark
brown
not
opaque
though
the
head
is
tan
and
thick
nice
looking
beer
a
mellow
roasty
chocolate
aroma
treats
im
immediately
pleased
with
the
solid
presence
of
hops
in
the
finish
on
the
way
to
that
finish
is
a
buttery
roasty
feeling
of
chocolateness
its
very
smooth
and
not
very
thick
at
all
not
too
thin
though
the
hoppy
finish
is
dry
and
wonderful
this
is
an
awesome
porter
surely
worth
your
time
beautiful
stupendous
head
and
retention
very
nice
amount
of
lace
the
color
of
the
beer
is
dark
amber
quite
dark
scents
of
port
wine
a
hint
of
coffee
caramel
and
an
array
of
hops
a
nice
molasses
too
its
a
creamy
and
straight
ahead
porter
a
little
toasty
and
woody
with
the
major
players
being
a
crisp
coffee
and
caramel
a
slight
sweet
gets
roasted
in
the
middle
and
dries
for
the
finish
very
bubbly
and
active
mouthfeel
but
i
am
going
to
stick
to
my
guns
on
the
creamy
note
i
had
at
the
start
of
this
review
very
drinkable
maybe
when
im
rich
i
sampled
this
at
a
moscow
beer
bar
it
came
out
room
temperature
which
didnt
hurt
it
at
all
poured
a
nice
deep
burgundy
brown
under
a
two
fingered
tan
head
with
plenty
of
contour
and
staying
power
mine
left
some
very
nice
lacework
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
mostly
caramel
and
nuts
with
just
a
hint
of
smokiness
the
mouth
was
heavy
with
sweetness
and
appropriately
carbonated
the
taste
was
as
it
should
be
a
bit
sweet
with
malts
and
plums
and
caramel
chased
by
a
mild
hoppy
bitterness
and
just
a
touch
of
roastiness
the
plum
and
hops
built
the
aftertaste
which
was
quite
pleasant
im
a
sucker
for
a
good
porter
and
this
is
a
good
one
a
very
english
style
porter
in
a
bottle
originally
designed
in
america
from
englands
most
innovative
and
interesting
brewery
sampled
back
in
long
beach
usa
circles
within
circles
this
is
a
very
good
high
quality
offering
now
this

would
be
very
good
if
served
on
cask
i
just
know
it
would
a
blend
of
old
and
new
ales
they
combine
for
a
very
nice
beer
quite
mellow
with
chocolate
and
some
gentle
chrarcoalish
flavors
normally
a
beer
this
mild
tends
to
be
onedimensional
but
here
we
have
both
depth
of
flavor
and
softness
a
nice
comfort
food
sort
of
porter
nice
olive
green
flaskstyle
bottle
it
pours
a
red
tinged
dark
chocolate
color
the
beige
head
of
various
sized
bubbles
fades
to
a
constantly
thinrimmed
coating
i
enjoy
the
coffee
and
chocolate
aroma
the
whiff
of
malt
light
smoke
burnt
caramel
and
hops
are
present
as
well
chocolate
malt
with
sweet
caramel
and
mild
coffee
mingle
quite
nicely
a
pleasant
citrus
bitterness
and
light
taste
of
plums
provide
some
balance
nice
porter
notes
not
too
robust
very
sweet
flavors
with
slight
roasted
bitterness
good
beer
might
be
a
good
intro
to
darker
flavors
this
is
a
very
characteristic
englishstyle
porter
comparable
to
fullers
in
many
ways
while
this
in
a
good
brew
i
prefer
my
porters
with
more
body
a
little
light
for
my
liking
very
seethrough
and
more
reddish
than
brownblack
looks
like
a
weak
dopplebock
decent
head
but
no
real
retention
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
here
very
roasted
and
sooty
with
some
smore
chocolate
lightly
roasted
malts
coffee
character
and
a
semisweet
chocolate
are
covered
by
a
hoppy
finish
that
balances
nicely
a
little
light
in
color
and
in
body
a
good
porter
but
not
outstanding
f
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
give
me
ten
of
these
please
a
sweet
drinkable
smooth
very
friendly
porter
this
one
poured
a
medium
brown
color
with
no
head
on
it
smelled
of
weak
malt
and
hop
mix
taste
was
quite
good
but
also
quite
weak
roasted
wood
comes
to
mind
here
floral
hops
are
in
the
background
and
come
through
by
the
middle
other
flavors
are
too
weak
to
detect
but
they
are
there
finishes
roasty
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
like
the
color
the
body
was
too
thin
to
be
a
porter
this
could
have
been
really
good
with
a
nice
bold
body
to
it
however
it
was
quite
drinkable
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
in
one
night
but
not
at
how
much
they
cost
ng
there
was
very
little
head
on
this
beer
which
had
a
nice
dark
brown
colored
body
the
aroma
has
a
hint
of
coffee
in
it
some
carbonation
rolls
off
the
tongue
but
not
much
it
has
a
pleasant
taste
indicative
of
the
porters
i
have
drunk
but
it
was
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
porters
still
it
is
a
beer
i
can
drink
all
night
long
st
peters
oldstyle
porter
comes
in
a
unique
olive
green
flask
shaped
bottle
the
info
on
the
bottle
say
that
this
is
a
blend
of
mature
old
ale
and
young
light
ale
it
pours
an
opaque
deep
brown
that
allows
a
little
ruby
to
show
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
there
is
minimal
head
with
poor
retention
and
a
just
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
healthy
and
earthy
like
fruity
chocolate
the
flavor
is
sweet
yet
roasty
and
full
overall
a
delicious
porter
a
brewery
reintroducing
us
to
an
old
method
of
blending
old
and
young
beers
a
good
one
for
the
curious
as
the
results
are
an
aquired
taste
not
unlike
a
lambic
it
is
a
reddish
brown
brew
with
a
tiny
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
complex
with
notes
of
molasses
malt
raisin
and
licorice
it
has
a
tangy
malt
and
hop
flavor
with
a
rich
malt
finish
thats
dry
and
acidic
like
a
red
wine
it
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
flavors
i
noticed
in
sam
smiths
imperial
stout
give
it
a
try
even
if
just
to
support
this
type
of
experimentation
not
a
great
quaffing
beer
to
say
the
least
yet
intresting
stuff
here
thanks
to
uglyradio
translucent
brown
color
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
is
noted
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
flavor
malt
backbone
is
lackinga
bit
thin
the
roasted
malt
lends
a
faint
bitterness
thats
passable
i
guess
is
this
old
style
true
to
style
i
dont
know
but
ill
pass
next
time
theres
too
many
others
that
are
far
better
imho
drinkability
average
this
is
an
interesting
brew
having
been
brewed
to
old
porter
standards
where
an
aged
dark
ale
and
a
young
lighter
ale
would
be
mixed
to
create
porter
having
said
that
i
dont
think
i
would
go
back
to
this
one
often
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
for
the
style
it
claimed
to
be
it
seemed
to
have
real
taste
of
chocolate
and
caramel
in
the
beer
from
its
natural
grains
it
was
as
if
they
had
actually
added
flavors
artificially
to
mash
it
had
a
small
and
fleeting
head
and
seemed
a
bit
watery
and
flat
on
mouthfeel
it
tasted
was
sweeet
and
finished
tha
same
as
it
tasted
to
start
my
friend
had
one
and
said
it
was
real
good
and
compared
it
to
a
local
beer
in
bru
room
bar
in
new
haven
ct
damm
good
expresso
stout
which
is
the
greatest
beer
i
have
ever
had
in
a
brew
pub
but
ill
review
that
one
at
a
later
when
i
finish
undercovering
all
is
many
complexities
my
point
i
guess
about
my
friend
is
that
he
knows
nothing
about
beer
after
making
those
comments
or
life
for
that
matter
and
he
was
drunk
this
beer
was
just
average
and
one
dimensional
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
pours
a
deep
amber
witha
small
head
and
leaves
some
lace
fruity
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
yeast
and
a
buttery
scent
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
but
did
have
a
smooth
mouthfeel
taste
started
roasted
malt
and
grain
with
a
little
spiciness
finishes
with
a
somewhat
sour
twang
that
is
undesirable
if
the
aftertaste
was
better
this
would
be
pretty
good
could
have
been
a
bad
bottle
so
i
may
give
it
another
shot
this
beer
is
a
very
dark
almost
black
tealike
color
it
presents
a
very
thin
shallow
head
and
a
magnificent
roasted
grain
aroma
also
the
smell
has
some
floral
characteristics
and
a
little
alcohol
can
be
detected
the
taste
is
of
bitter
coffee
with
burnt
and
roasted
grain
flavors
overall
the
beer
is
very
dry
however
and
nicely
complex
the
finish
is
a
lingering
bitterness

old

its
not

heavy
so
much
as
beautifully
soft
and
creamy
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
excellent
i
feel
classy
drinking
this
funny
how
you
sometimes
find
the
best
beers
on
the
lowest
shelves
covered
in
dust
pours
pitch
black
with
a
slight
head
that
laces
and
retains
less
than
normal
light
nose
of
chocolate
roast
and
dark
fruit
dates
figs
raisins
with
a
touch
of
coffee
over
a
light
rich
malt
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
a
very
slick
approaching
creamy
texture
below
normal
carbonation
with
no
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
excellent
flavor
profile
is
quite
complex
yet
balanced
alcohol
is
noticed
on
the
first
sip
but
then
becomes
well
hidden
it
begins
with
a
rush
of
dark
chocolate
sweetness
and
roast
over
a
light
coffee
background
then
the
dark
fruit
flavors
predominate
the
middle
the
finish
is
a
slow
fade
of
the
flavor
profile
where
the
spicy
hops
become
evident
and
leaves
a
nice
alcohol
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
and
excellent
beer
the
name
is
spot
on
color
and
viscosity
is
right
in
line
with
burnt
engine
oil
definitely
worth
a
try
a
remarkable
beer
from
a
great
brewery
the
texture
has
velvety
richness
to
it
but
remarkably
drinkable
bouquet
of
chocolate
and
iron
flavor
profile
is
very
complex
with
an
iron
like
flavor
giving
way
to
deep
malty
and
chocolate
flavors
one
of
my
favorite
porters
b
this
comes
very
close
to
the
very
top
would
have
been
better
if
it
kept
the
rich
roastiness
of
the
regular
old
engine
oil
actually
if
the
alcoholic
sweetness
didnt
cover
it
up
still
a
huge
english
porter
doesnt
really
meld
wood
is
just
laid
on
top
of
the
base
beer
cuts
too
dry
and
loses
the
smoothness
of
oee
pours
the
color
and
viscosity
of
you
guessed
it
old
engine
oil
nice
tan
milk
chocolatey
looking
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
smoky
toasty
malt
and
it
smells
damn
delicious
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
amazing
are
the
major
flavor
notes
this
thing
is
chewy
like
chocolate
syrup
i
dont
want
this
bottle
to
end
i
want
to
stop
this
review
and
enjoy
it
soooo
bye

but
i
am
not
super
impressed
with
this
beer
either
my
favorite
part
about
this
beer
is
how
the
elements
of
sweet
and
bittered
chocolate
come
together
at
the
price
i
paid
for
this
beer
straightforward
porter
everything
about
this
is
entirely
normal
and
civilized
change
the
label
and
id
give
it
higher
ratings
its
a
good
drink

very

porter
it
really
delivers
on
the
roast
flavor
i
want
in
a
porter
not
quite
as
complex
as
american
porters
but
is
everything
you
look
for
in
a
traditional
example
of
a
porter
i
will
definitely
have
this
again

final
notes
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
big
flavor
and
complex
deliciously
sweet
and
savory
excellent
dessert
beer
or
to
finish
the
night
out
with
highly
recommended
this
is
not
an
ale
for
the
weakstomached
or
weakminded
and
while
that
makes
it
exotic
and
extraordinary
it
also
marks
a
weakness
for
it
takes
a
special
tongue
to
appreciate
this
kind
of
flavor
try
at
your
own
risk
but
do
tryits
an
experience
you
wont
soon
forget
overall
great
porter
and
one
i
will
recommend
and
have
again
over
all
this
just
went
to
my
top
15
beers
i
would
say
i
am
really
impressed
i
wouldnt
drink
several
in
a
night
but
i
would
relax
with
one
just
about
any
night
this
is
a
great
beer
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
not
the
best
i
have
had
of
this
style
but
far
from
the
worst
who
knows
how
old
it
was
and
if
that
played
a
factor
o
highly
pleasurable
experience
with
great
drinkability
perfect
beer
to
accompany
meals
picked
this
up
at
the
biggest
beer
store
in
the
uk
beers
of
europe
ltd
dark
brownblack
pour
with
half
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
film
with
decent
lacing
very
earthy
roasty
smokey
nose
with
hints
of
coffee
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
licorice
the
taste
is
dominated
by
roasty
smokey
burnt
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
a
spicy
herbal
bitter
hop
bite
emerges
as
it
warms
along
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
finish
im
typically
not
a
big
porter
fan
as
they
seem
a
bit
thin
to
me
but
this
was
slightly
syrupy
and
thick
and
really
smooth
without
being
too
sweet
and
i
never
find
myself
wanting
a
second
porter
but
again
this
was
really
tasty
and
had
me
wanting
another
very
pleasant
surprise
note
added
some
talisker
10
yo
single
malt
scotch
in
it
later
because
this
one
seemed
like
a
good
candidate
for
fooling
around
the
aroma
of
this
pseudoaged
beer
became
incredibly
good
but
the
contributions
to
the
taste
were
minimal
while
the
aroma
was
full
of
everything
delicate
about
talisker
the
taste
inherited
a
touch
of
peat
smoke
at
the
end
overall
solid
porter
i
would
get
this
beer
again
if
i
found
another
bottle
of
it
just
a
bit
dissapointed
with
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
i
wanted
to
see
a
fuller
bodied
porter
than
i
got
overall
what
a
nice
beer
i
got
a
single
of
this
at
a
giant
eagle
of
all
places
what
a
nice
little
find
i
will
try
to
see
if
i
can
get
more
of
these
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
love
porters
and
this
one
is
simple
and
delicious
with
all
the
clean
roasted
flavors
o
overall
a
very
nice
brew
id
have
this
one
again
and
i
would
especially
be
interested
in
trying
some
of
the
other
versions
overall
amazing
beer
no
frills
added
but
it
gets
all
of
the
flavors
it
possibly
can
out
of
the
ingredients
6
abv
is
relatively
low
which
is
nice
in
this
culture
of
huge
alcohol
beers
i
wish
this
was
more
accessible
but
i
will
certainly
be
picking
more
of
this
up
every
aspect
of
this
beer
works
together
in
perfect
harmony
i
have
not
been
this
impressed
with
a
porter
in
a
while
my
new
favorite
for
the
style
one
of
my
favorite
experiences
is
picking
up
a
random
and
unhyped
beer
at
the
store
on
a
whim
and
having
it
be
this
good
pours
near
black
with
a
singlefinger
offwhite
head
retention
is
okay
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
spotty
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
carries
some
light
chocolate
plus
some
roast
more
of
the
roast
than
anything
else
a
bit
of
coffee
as
it
warms
the
flavor
is
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
coffee
and
some
slight
milk
chocolate
notes
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
fairly
creamy
and
lends
a
toffeelike
feel
nothing
crazy
but
a
pretty
good
brew
o
ive
heard
this
a
gold
standard
of
english
porters
and
i
can
understand
why
a
smooth
and
balanced
porter
with
lots
of
depth
and
a
hoppy
finish
i
actually
like
i
didnt
notice
the
alcohol
kick
that
a
6
brew
should
have
its
debatable
whether
or
not
that
is
a
good
thing
this
beer
pours
out
much
thicker
looking
than
most
porters
out
there
even
looks
thicker
than
some
stouts
the
color
is
black
with
a
fan
colored
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
much
the
smell
is
earthy
and
roasted
the
taste
is
rich
with
heavy
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
had
a
oily
feel
to
it
overall
pretty
good
brew
overall
this
is
a
great
porter
or
old
ale
or
black
ale
or
whatever
looking
forward
to
trying
the
ola
dubh
16
in
my
cellar
the
mouthfeel
is
an
absolute
highlight
of
an
already
great
brew
its
fullbodied
creamy
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
being
a
slog
to
get
through
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
overall
a
superlative
porter
that
stands
at
the
front
of
its
class
highly
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
dark
mahogany
in
colored
that
comes
together
to
appear
almost
black
it
features
a
nice
beige
lacing
around
the
edges
of
my
snifter
it
smells
of
lightly
roasted
coffee
with
a
nice
bitter
chocolate
finish
it
tastes
of
rich
coffee
and
overly
bitter
chocolate
the
chocolate
aspect
is
almost
too
bitter
it
does
leave
a
nice
after
taste
behind
though
it
drinks
a
lot
thicker
than
it
looked
while
pouring
it
coats
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
i
just
wish
it
werent
as
bitter
as
it
was
but
its
still
a
solid
porter
this
was
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
but
it
will
not
be
my
last
an
outstanding
beer
overall
an
amazing
porter
that
relies
heavily
in
its
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
it
starts
out
sweeter
and
turns
bitter
as
you
drink
it
the
main
flaw
imo
is
that
the
aromatic
hops
shine
a
little
bit
too
much
in
the
aftertaste
instead
of
the
malts
also
as
mentioned
above
the
aroma
needs
a
little
kick
this
has
got
to
be
hands
down
one
of
the
finest
porters
available
a
musttry
for
ever
porter
lover
highly
recommended
overall
very
good
for
the
beer
style
and
a
perplexing
tasting
looks
like
the
label
has
changed
it
now
says
black
ale
instead
of
porter
no
matter
the
style
its
a
good
beer
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
is
a
really
good
porter
with
lots
of
flavor
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
am
glad
i
got
to
drink
it
though
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
or
accompanying
a
meal
i
think
this
would
make
a
great
desert
beer
a
little
pricy
for
everyday
drinking
but
well
worth
the
try
i
got
it
because
it
is
apparently
the
beer
that
becomes
ola
duba
which
i
grabbed
for
my
cellar
very
nice
brew
gave
me
hope
for
the
future
of
my
ola
duba
o
there
is
good
drinkability
here
it
has
nice
flavor
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
its
sweet
but
has
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
practically
perfect
in
every
way
pours
viscously
with
a
brown
head
weighed
down
by
the
gravity
of
the
beer
itself
smells
of
all
the
darks
roasted
chocolate
dried
fruits
awesomeness
super
malt
machine
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
a
porter
that
i
can
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
overall
this
is
truly
a
world
class
beer
everything
about
old
engine
oil
screams
attention
to
detail
and
experienced
craftsmanship
the
price
is
a
little
steep
considering
the
size
of
one
bottle
but
it
is
well
worth
the
expense
as
this
particular
brew
is
truly
sensational
and
an
excellent
addition
to
a
fine
meal
d
a
velvety
bittersweet
fullbodied
balanced
porter
pretty
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
ola
dubh
which
uses
this
beer
as
a
base
recommended
overall
this
is
a
delightful
porter
that
makes
me
proud
of
my
scottish
heritage
o
this
could
easily
make
itself
a
go
to
porter
very
good
great
appearance
good
roasted
smoky
flavor
and
light
enough
to
drink
several
pours
a
black
color
with
no
light
getting
through
and
a
brownishtan
color
head
that
is
three
fingers
in
depth
and
frothy
no
lace
is
left
the
smell
is
of
roastiness
along
with
dark
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
has
a
roasty
backbone
with
hints
of
licorice
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
is
rounded
out
by
dark
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
well
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
high
the
drink
goes
down
very
easy
very
good
flavor
and
well
rounded
d
well
made
porter
its
one
ill
have
again
soon
verdict
had
on
tap
the
glass
was
nice
and
dark
slight
head
smell
was
almost
burnt
ends
with
a
strong
taste
of
dark
roasted
coffee
the
feel
really
lasted
with
the
burnt
feeling
of
coffee
and
chocolate
finally
the
drinkabilty
is
good
as
this
would
be
something
i
would
drink
again
d
an
interesting
change
of
pace
for
sure
the
dryness
and
the
creeping
sourness
would
make
it
hard
to
have
more
than
two
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
helping
with
no
problem
a
very
unique
brew
that
i
will
come
back
to
periodically
to
check
in
with
a
rare
5
0
here
have
seen
this
for
years
and
never
jumped
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
ever
had
if
not
the
best
porter
hands
down
wow
is
this
drinkable
stuff
deep
and
dark
with
a
inviting
head
the
taste
is
rich
with
roasted
malt
some
hops
and
a
bit
of
smokiness
come
out
in
the
finish
this
is
the
kind
of
exceptional
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
on
a
chilly
evening
in
these
days
of
dipas
imperial
stouts
etc
its
easy
to
forget
how
satisfying
a
smaller
beer
like
this
can
be
overall
i
really
appreciated
it
and
it
was
just
what
i
was
looking
for
tonight
i
would
have
been
happy
with
a
smaller
bottle
but
im
gonna
blame
this
one
on
my
boredashellno
matterwhatim
drinking
tonight
taste
buds
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
dark
malts
have
an
unusual
balance
with
the
flavor
so
that
it
comes
across
a
little
on
the
harsh
side
it
is
getting
easier
to
drink
as
i
am
about
halfway
through
the
glass
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
just
a
little
on
the
rich
side
to
be
a
regular
drinker
d
a
hearty
beer
complex
in
flavours
a
great
example
of
a
porter
though
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
drinkability
a
good
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
initially
but
i
believe
this
is
a
beer
that
could
grow
on
me
i
need
to
get
more
accustomed
to
this
style
of
beer
d
very
tasty
drink
and
well
recommended
d
a
great
porter
has
a
rich
profile
without
being
too
overthetop
a
fine
drinker
for
what
it
is
drinkability
i
dig
this
a
good
everyday
drinking
black
ale
d
really
good
great
tasting
and
smooth
feel
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
porter
d
great
drinkability
i
didnt
give
it
a
5
here
however
just
because
of
the
lingering
roasted
and
bitterness
for
an
exceptional
here
it
would
have
had
to
have
a
cleaner
finish
all
in
all
a
great
beer
except
for
the
3
99
per
12oz
bottle
that
makes
for
an
expensive
afternoon
and
thus
also
brings
down
my
drinkability
scale
to
a
4
5
love
to
have
another
all
in
all
this
brew
kind
of
disappointed
not
as
good
as
expected
definitely
many
better
ones
in
the
style
not
worth
your
time
a
sipper
rather
than
a
multibeer
quaffer
d
a
porter
that
drinks
like
a
stout
i
think
ill
have
another
d
very
nice
this
delivers
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
striving
for
on
the
bottle
drinkability
if
you
like
your
stouts
dark
then
check
under
the
bottle
top
of
this
beauty
your
going
to
like
it
trust
me
my
dads
a
used
car
salesman
very
well
crafted
world
class
porter
very
drinkable
for
a
porter
nice
and
smooth
this
is
a
good
find
mouth
is
very
nice
doesnt
dry
to
much
d
a
little
tough
to
drink
too
much
due
to
the
dryness
and
astringent
aftertaste
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
will
be
picking
up
more
at
the
first
opportunity
d
first
tried
this
one
at
a
beer
festival
and
have
bought
it
quite
a
few
times
since
then
it
has
a
great
taste
and
feel
to
it
you
wont
get
bored
with
this
beer
with
all
the
flavors
it
has
d
easily
drinkable
but
i
would
switch
up
sooner
than
layer
a
great
beer
totally
drinkable
and
fun
and
tasty
poured
it
out
and
it
is
very
black
and
thick
just
as
the
name
would
suggest
great
head
but
went
away
fairly
quickly
lacing
is
great
aroma
is
off
roasted
malts
coffee
and
very
bitter
dark
chocolate
i
even
get
hints
of
wood
taste
is
exceptional
and
sits
very
well
with
the
smell
they
seem
to
balance
each
other
very
well
really
like
the
mouth
feel
very
smooth
aftertaste
is
very
slight
and
doesnt
stick
around
which
is
what
i
like
most
about
this
beer
you
can
go
right
to
trying
something
else
without
having
that
lingering
taste
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
i
could
drink
several
pints
of
this
very
easily
great
beer
nice
easy
and
enjoyable
md
smooth
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
thinner
than
i
expected
flavor
is
a
bit
more
intence
but
nice
though
one
is
enough
in
a
night
d
the
name
says
it
all
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
that
suits
the
word
oil
better
doesnt
have
a
high
abv
but
is
very
heavy
and
filling
d
at
6
its
very
drinkable
unlike
many
porters
it
doesnt
taste
thin
seems
to
withstand
quite
low
temperatures
this
feels
like
quite
a
demanding
beer
to
drink
though
as
it
takes
some
analysis
to
get
all
the
flavours
out
and
in
order
alternatively
just
sit
down
and
enjoy
the
symphony
fantastic
stuff
price
3
99
at
whole
foods
an
absolutely
excellent
english
porter
incredibly
enjoyable
and
worth
seeking
out
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
and
spreading
the
good
word
around
every
chance
i
get
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
tannish
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
roasted
barley
a
little
smoke
and
chocolate
tastes
pretty
good
with
lots
of
roasted
flavors
coffee
toffee
chocolate
and
some
smoke
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
oily
somewhat
easy
to
drink
i
like
the
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
the
alcohol
isnt
all
that
high
but
its
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
like
unless
im
drinking
a
high
abv
beer
or
an
ipa
theres
nothing
smooth
about
this
the
pour
procures
an
epically
dark
brown
nearly
black
viscous
liquid
that
is
crowned
with
a
1
5
thick
frothy
beige
head
the
glass
is
adorned
with
much
lacing
and
the
head
retains
as
a
bubbly
ring
with
a
large
island
in
the
center
i
cant
even
begin
to
describe
how
rich
and
balanced
the
aromas
are
cant
help
but
take
a
sip
and
both
aroma
and
flavor
are
described
together
hefty
amounts
of
cocoa
and
coffee
at
first
then
comes
a
nice
and
subtle
thats
the
key
here
ashiness
that
is
balanced
by
sweet
caramel
and
biscuits
hint
of
burnt
toast
and
blackstrap
molasses
there
is
no
alcoholic
burn
only
a
tiny
warmth
is
apparent
in
the
finish
bitterness
akin
to
coffee
and
char
linger
on
and
on
carbonation
is
as
good
as
is
gets
yielding
a
velvety
smooth
texture
to
this
surprisingly
lightmedium
bodied
beer
looks
can
be
deceiving
but
as
such
this
is
a
lovely
drinker
that
i
would
be
happy
to
quaff
all
day
d
i
could
drink
several
of
these
even
though
its
kind
of
thick
bodied
its
not
very
heavy
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
it
is
a
good
enough
beer
to
drink
more
than
just
one
bought
this
as
a
single
shop
owner
said
is
was
one
of
his
personal
favorites
pours
a
thick
syrupy
dark
opaque
dark
brown
to
black
with
hints
of
maroon
at
the
edges
thin
head
which
dissipates
quickly
rich
chocolatey
roasted
flavor
with
hints
of
cherry
chewy
feel
with
no
aftertaste
wishing
i
had
bought
more
than
one
of
these
think
its
going
to
become
one
ofmy
faves
overall
i
didnt
find
this
beer
to
be
overpowering
but
rather
had
a
good
deal
of
nuance
that
the
uk
tends
to
favor
more
than
us
across
the
pond
an
interesting
and
well
made
beer
thats
well
worth
a
shot
da
very
good
porter
overall
this
is
good
beer
a
real
easy
drinking
flavorful
porter
i
recommend
trying
this
one
12oz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
almost
opaque
black
with
a
nice
frothy
light
tan
head
that
lasts
as
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
smooth
dark
malts
with
slight
bakers
cocoa
the
taste
is
loads
of
dark
malts
cocoa
smooth
coffee
and
slight
molasses
very
complex
this
is
a
great
english
porter
one
i
would
certainly
have
again
this
is
by
far
a
session
beer
the
6
abv
makes
you
aware
the
beer
is
there
and
the
body
of
the
beer
does
too
i
do
think
that
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
wish
that
more
brands
lived
up
to
this
standard
d
the
char
and
bitter
chocolate
arent
overpowering
would
drink
2
at
a
bar
if
i
caught
this
on
tap
good
solid
drinkability
overall
a
very
nice
brew
drink
if
i
was
having
a
second
round
of
dessert
or
it
was
cold
out
another
would
have
been
ordered
very
good
porter
d
an
enjoyable
english
porter
that
teeters
on
the
edge
of
being
a
world
class
offering
but
falls
ever
so
slightly
short
i
would
still
welcome
on
future
occasions
and
would
recommend
for
any
serious
ba
loaded
with
enjoyable
subtleties
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
two
fingers
of
brown
head
this
beer
is
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
the
aroma
is
chocolate
and
nutty
the
taste
is
dominated
by
some
bitter
hops
with
a
bitter
coffee
taste
i
dont
remember
this
beer
being
this
bitter
i
recall
a
more
chocolaty
flavor
it
fells
viscous
in
my
mouth
i
am
left
disappointed
in
this
one
the
aroma
was
great
but
the
taste
was
too
bitter
d
excellent
a
great
porter
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
if
this
wasnt
so
damn
expensive3
50
for
one
12oz
id
drink
this
regularly
fun
labeling
on
good
beer
this
black
ale
truly
looks
black
but
basically
is
like
an
espressoextra
roasted
version
of
stout
poured
a
meager
12
head
which
dissipated
same
basic
stout
flavors
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
certainly
more
so
of
each
than
usual
from
the
label
and
name
i
pretty
much
expected
goop
to
pour
out
but
no
its
not
anywhere
near
that
thick
in
fact
many
common
stouts
are
thicker
tmd
follows
the
aromas
with
the
licorice
and
molasses
dominating
a
beautifully
thick
beer
with
a
nice
residual
sweetness
that
balances
the
other
flavours
out
to
virtual
perfection

overall
this
is
a

thinner
than
a

medium
to
light

with
a

hint
in
the

almost
looks

smells
like
a
stout
but
not

rich
quite
nice
overall
drinkability
i
think
i
could
really
get
into
this
beer
on
cool
fall
nights
much
like
tonight
the
flavors
are
really
good
and
robust
and
the
abv
isnt
going
to
be
something
that
knocks
you
on
the
ground
d
finishing
this
one
wont
be
hard
at
all
the
amazing
taste
makes
in
a
porter
to
sip
on
and
savor
d
6
and
all
this
flavor
give
me
another
this
is
a
big
beer
for
only
6
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
theres
reason
they
only
sell
you
one
im
going
to
work
on
this
one
for
a
while
a
wellmade
old
school
porter
with
lots
and
lots
going
on
but
not
too
much
of
any
one
thing
thankfully
the
expected
sourness
is
well
accompanied
by
lots
of
cocoa
malt
coffee
and
fruit
all
in
appropriate
proportions
which
goes
a
long
way
in
explaining
the
steady
common
popularity
of
this
offering
beer
is
thin
and
quite
bitter
in
the
back
but
thats
from
the
roast
its
moderately
sweet
up
front
but
there
isnt
much
going
on
in
the
midpalate
the
beer
is
creamy
and
smooth
overall
and
leaves
only
this
bitterness
as
a
lasting
aftertaste
its
pretty
good
d
overall
a
very
tasty
offering
and
more
than
i
was
expecting
could
throw
back
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
and
the
mouthfeel
keeps
you
craving
more
flavours
are
discreet
and
pleasant
but
not
overpowering
recommended
to
any
porter
fan
this
beer
is
unbelievably
good
you
can
tell
it
has
a
scottish
heritage
easy
on
the
hops
and
big
malt
favor
drinkability
i
probably
wont
be
reaching
for
this
one
again
its
certainly
an
wellcrafted
beer
however
there
isnt
enough
depth
of
flavor
and
the
burnt
bitterness
is
piercing
and
leads
to
palette
fatigue
d
very
enjoyable
and
not
too
heavy
i
wouldnt
drink
this
too
often
but
when
i
do
it
will
be
a
fun
reunion
i
didnt
enjoy
this
quite
so
much
the
first
time
i
drank
it
but
i
appreciate
it
much
more
now
really
enjoy
the
roastyness
of
it
maybe
it
was
drinking
ola
dubh
old
engine
oil
aged
in
scotch
whisky
casks
and
feeling
the
things
i
enjoyed
about
that
beer
so
much
which
increased
my
appreciation
of
old
engine
oil
this
is
a
nearly
perfect
beer
i
cant
imagine
anything
being
changed
on
this
brew
to
make
it
better
this
is
in
my
top
10
overall
a
disappointment
d
very
high
and
delicious
near
perfect
based
on
abv
and
overall
combination
and
execution
of
flavors
d
especially
good
cheers
this
is
allaround
good
but
nothing
jumped
out
to
me
as
great
i
had
higher
hopes
as
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
nice
stout
but
tastes
more
like
a
baltic
porter
honestly
too
often
when
it
comes
to
english
style
stouts
i
find
that
the
fuggles
and
goldings
give
them
an
oxidized
ruddy
mouthfeel
that
i
dont
care
for
but
this
seems
to
be
nicely
offset
by
the
galena
at
3
99
for
the
12oz
bottle
im
not
inclined
to
buy
it
again
as
kzoo
stout
is
cheaper
more
readly
available
where
i
am
at
and
tastier
imo
dark
color
almost
black
but
when
placed
against
the
light
it
shows
a
dark
reddish
tint
its
foam
is
slightly
persistent
in
the
glass
aroma
nice
boquet
of
coffee
light
touch
of
vanilla
and
roasted
malt
taste
of
coffee
bitter
and
dry
very
drinkable
and
delicious
the
label
of
this
beer
is
different
here
in
brazil
pretty
good
offering
that
i
may
give
one
more
shot
at
some
point
but
certainly
nothing
that
blew
me
away
a
wonderfully
pleasant
and
surprisingly
drinkable
ale
not
really
befitting
the
name
this
is
much
more
enjoyable
than
a
glass
of
similarlylooking
dirty
engine
lube
or
at
least
i
would
assume
as
much
very
well
done
this
will
likely
become
a
beer
that
i
keep
on
hand
with
some
regularity
pick
some
of
this
up
the
next
time
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
you
wont
be
disappointed
for
a
first
beer
from
a
brewer
i
think
i
picked
a
good
one
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
brews
by
these
guys
that
just
got
released
here
in
alberta
drinkability
while
listed
as
a
porter
it
was
once
listed
as
an
old
ale
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
tests
the
myth
that
the
difference
between
a
porter
and
a
stout
lies
in
the
dark
roast
malt
ive
found
with
this
beer
that
while
it
should
be
sipped
slowly
and
savored
each
sip
also
follows
naturally
from
the
first
and
im
finishing
this
beer
wanting
more
than
there
is
ill
certainly
seek
this
beer
out
to
have
again
in
the
future
drinkability
the
thick
robust
flavor
definitely
makes
it
a
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
however
the
complex
taste
is
something
that
can
definitely
be
enjoyed
for
a
beer
or
three
d
very
drinkable
given
the
lower
abv
for
how
strong
a
flavor
this
delicious
porter
offers
this
was
the
third
in
my
series
of
british
brews
tonight
following
oxfordshire
triple
b
england
and
williams
brothers
alba
scots
pine
ale
scotland
boy
did
the
scots
ever
blow
away
the
english
tonight
i
was
a
bit
worried
after
drinking
the
fabulous
alba
but
even
though
i
bucked
the
trend
and
rated
the
harvietaun
lower
it
was
a
great
beer
to
end
the
night
with
like
an
afterdinner
coffee
i
like
how
this
is
definitely
a
porter
in
the
classic
sense
very
drinkable
id
pick
this
up
again
for
sure
great
example
of
the
style
though
im
not
sure
what
it
has
to
do
with
engine
oil
d
this
is
definately
drinkable
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
if
you
are
into
this
style
m
dry
and
light
this
has
to
be
considered
a
classic
of
the
style
coffee
bitter
chocolate
molasses
dark
fruits
charred
wood
a
bracing
grassy
bitterness
that
has
a
faint
citrus
note
in
there
nice
toffee
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
slightly
thin
body
but
at
6
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
loaded
with
flavor
porter
you
would
gladly
session
really
very
nice
this
is
what
the
style
was
meant
to
be
d
excellent
porter
well
hidden
abv
complex
and
has
a
lot
going
on
with
it
also
quite
drinkable
and
can
have
23
and
not
get
tired
of
it
slight
creamy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
excellent
drinkability
is
good
tastes
more
like
a
porter
than
an
old
ale
to
me
pretty
good
beer
overall
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
me
and
the
carbonation
feels
a
little
bit
underwhelming
but
its
still
good
with
small
quite
sharp
bubbles
an
enjoyable
old
ale
and
probably
a
good
introduction
to
this
style
both
in
flavor
and
price
i
personally
prefer
their
ola
dubh
which
have
a
lot
more
going
on
with
various
subtle
things
in
the
flavor
good
nevertheless
i
love
this
beer
most
especially
on
draft
great
by
itself
or
with
fruity
chocolaty
or
rich
in
general
desserts
d
i
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
overall
quite
enjoyable
for
sure
id
like
to
review
this
one
again
down
the
road
after
my
senses
develop
a
bit
better
and
see
if
i
can
pick
anything
else
out
d
great
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
overall
im
very
impressed
with
the
beer
the
flavor
was
very
balanced
and
delicious
great
amount
of
chocolate
and
malts
well
done
very
sweet
to
me
with
some
ripe
cheese
and
ginger
bread
perhaps
d
i
would
have
guessed
this
to
be
more
of
an
english
stout
than
an
old
ale
but
either
way
its
quite
tasty
its
a
decent
beer
nice
one
one
of
several
nice
birthday
beer
gifts
from
my
wife
this
year
picked
it
out
with
help
from
john
at
granite
liquors
in
weymouth
thanks
to
both
poured
it
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
comes
out
as
close
to
black
as
possible
but
its
dark
brown
when
held
up
to
the
light
and
pouring
it
you
can
see
some
deep
mahogany
colors
right
around
the
edges
it
has
an
off
white
colored
head
it
doesnt
take
too
long
for
it
to
go
away
and
provides
a
little
bit
of
glass
retention
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
looking
beer
i
wouldnt
say
it
looks
like
old
engine
oil
in
my
opinion
but
i
guess
thats
a
good
thing
smell
is
very
good
it
has
a
lot
going
on
has
some
dark
fruitfig
characteristics
almost
more
like
a
dark
fruity
liquor
though
it
has
some
chocolate
aromas
to
compliment
the
well
roasted
malts
this
has
a
bready
smell
to
it
which
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
but
its
quite
pleasant
in
this
mixture
of
aromas
not
a
very
hoppy
beer
but
not
exactly
a
hophead
brew
the
taste
is
equally
excellent
chocolate
roasted
malts
are
the
dominant
flavor
it
still
has
fruitiness
to
it
not
as
dominant
as
the
smell
but
still
good
the
dark
fruit
liquor
taste
actually
takes
a
slight
backseat
to
some
hops
hear
but
only
slightly
they
are
both
in
the
vehicle
if
you
know
what
i
mean
well
balanced
flavor
overall
very
tasty
if
my
jeeps
old
engine
oil
tasted
anything
like
this
id
be
drinking
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
not
as
thick
as
i
expected
it
to
be
based
on
the
name
its
by
no
means
light
bodied
its
still
a
full
bodied
beer
its
somewhat
smooth
close
to
creamy
and
incredibly
drinkable
this
beer
could
be
drank
on
any
occasion
whatsoever
its
full
enough
for
the
lovers
of
dark
beer
and
smooth
and
drinkable
enough
for
the
those
who
like
the
lighter
ones
i
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
gateway
beer
for
those
who
are
trying
to
get
into
darker
beers
a
truly
great
beer
drinkability
good
by
itself
or
with
a
meal
but
its
so
intense
in
its
bittersweet
flavor
that
i
think
i
could
only
have
one
an
evening
or
id
burn
out
my
tastebuds
a
nice
solid
beer
but
not
one
that
was
really
any
better
on
cask
then
it
was
on
gas
imho
still
a
nice
beer
d
drinking
this
beer
wasnt
that
difficult
it
seemed
to
be
something
like
a
hybrid
between
a
porter
and
a
stout
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
ill
have
to
go
back
and
have
another
before
the
keg
kicks
d
very
good
this
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
stoutblack
ale
i
wasnt
that
dazzled
by
the
smell
a
sort
of
sweet
milk
with
some
roast
but
this
dark
brew
has
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
roast
coffee
in
it
i
will
definitely
seek
out
a
couple
more
of
these
good
job
scotland
best
before
date
sept
09
yep
more
than
six
months
later
this
bad
boy
holds
up
pretty
well
black
as
engine
oil
lovely
nose
of
complex
malts
roastiness
touch
of
coffee
and
some
liqoriceits
lost
nothing
a
rich
viscous
mouthfeel
that
finishes
long
and
memorably
top
shelf
black
ale
that
proves
it
has
life
well
beyond
its
bbd
ill
jump
on
board
the
this
really
makes
me
think
of
a
stout
and
it
should
be
band
wagon
im
sure
they
call
it
an
old
ale
partially
because
it
wouldnt
be
considered
as
special
if
it
was
just
another
stout
which
it
isnt
i
consumed
this
faster
than
is
normal
for
me
a
lovely
dark
ale
not
in
character
with
an
old
ale
at
all
had
i
tried
this
blindfolded
id
have
pegged
it
as
a
rich
cherrychocolate
porter
m
d
creamy
velvety
the
slight
bitterness
is
well
within
bounds
and
the
overall
balance
is
excellent
on
tap
the
old
engine
oil
offers
a
bit
more
fruit
complexity
but
is
also
a
bit
on
the
still
side
for
co2
very
easydrinking
for
such
a
substantial
brew
d
due
to
mouthfeel
and
great
taste
its
a
great
drinker
notes
nice
fairly
complex
beer
has
aspects
of
a
number
of
different
styles
and
has
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
than
i
was
really
expecting
from
an
old
ale
that
smells
a
lot
like
a
porterstout
it
isnt
my
favorite
beer
to
sip
on
but
it
is
definitely
a
nice
one
that
offers
a
change
of
pace
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
its
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
normally
perfer
but
i
can
drink
this
all
night
dthis
was
decidedly
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
it
to
be
i
could
see
myself
having
a
couple
of
these
on
a
cold
winter
night
which
is
unfortunately
what
we
have
in
store
for
us
tomorrow
time
for
a
beer
run
slightly
thin
feel
at
first
not
too
much
just
thinner
than
expected
however
this
builds
to
a
substantial
body
with
very
thick
viscous
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
once
in
a
blue
moon
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
the
style
d
goes
down
easy
it
would
be
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
put
down
a
few
of
these
drinkability
would
love
this
with
oysters
dark
brown
and
impossible
to
see
through
with
a
whipped
up
tan
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
fine
lace
behind
on
the
glass
dark
chocolate
malt
dark
fruit
and
some
roasty
coffee
are
all
present
and
accounted
for
in
the
nose
rich
and
roasty
flavors
are
well
balanced
with
a
heavy
handed
hop
bittering
that
really
balances
the
sweet
malty
flavors
nicely
really
nice
and
complex
flavors
nice
and
medium
full
bodied
with
bright
carbonation
a
truly
unique
beer
deep
dark
shiny
crude
oil
black
at
first
look
but
with
ruby
highlights
and
lowlights
minimal
compact
and
creamy
brown
head
with
an
agressive
pour
big
bold
intense
roasted
grain
sweet
toffee
dark
fruit
earthy
and
floral
hops
and
molasses
scents
taste
is
slightly
more
subdued
than
scent
with
a
full
roasted
grain
profile
without
tasting
burnt
backed
by
sweet
nutty
toffee
dark
dried
fruit
and
a
nice
bitter
earthy
and
floral
hop
presence
medium
bodied
smooth
and
faintly
coating
truly
unique
name
appearance
and
smell
make
you
think
overpowering
but
taste
and
bosy
is
nothing
but
pleasing
and
smooth
id
be
willing
to
order
this
for
more
than
one
round
but
not
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
i
want
this
beer
to
be
a
treat
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
am
glad
to
have
finally
gotten
around
to
trying
it
not
as
rich
thick
and
overpowering
as
the
big
stouts
so
many
of
us
are
into
but
its
not
trying
to
be
there
is
alot
going
on
for
especially
for
the
size
very
drinkable
old
ale
i
would
call
this
more
of
a
stout
regardless
still
a
very
nice
ale
that
is
worthy
of
a
try
what
else
needs
to
be
said
look
at
the
ratings
this
is
easily
on
of
the
finest
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
privilege
to
experience
the
aroma
of
cocoa
coffee
roasted
malt
and
caramel
sugar
waft
over
the
thick
creamy
head
and
the
thick
viscous
black
liquid
that
lies
beneath
even
after
sessioning
a
few
other
beers
including
one
of
the
ipa
beasts
from
stone
this
beers
flavors
are
so
rich
and
so
pronounced
that
there
is
no
denying
the
amount
of
care
and
quality
in
this
product
my
friend
simply
put
it
this
way
after
his
first
sip
if
i
could
die
right
now
i
would
be
a
happy
man
at
6
abv
this
beer
is
not
a
session
beer
but
just
misses
that
by
a
notch
as
others
have
alluded
to
this
seems
like
more
of
a
scotch
ale
than
anything
else
and
is
a
good
drink
to
have
during
these
cold
winter
months
it
doesnt
have
the
bourbonbarrel
aftertaste
to
it
but
nevertheless
its
a
worth
a
shot
once
since
this
isnt
a
style
that
one
comes
across
every
day
in
my
opinion
this
resembles
new
engine
oil
more
than
anything
else
medium
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
a
tad
chewy
this
one
threw
me
for
a
loop
with
the
smell
taste
combo
fortunately
it
was
not
overwhelming
in
any
aspect
i
had
a
real
good
time
alternating
the
smell
flavor
smells
like
a
flemish
brown
tastes
like
a
schwarzbier
very
interesting
indeed
not
sure
it
lives
up
the
name
old
engine
oil
conjures
a
thick
viscous
brew
a
la
ten
fidy
or
old
viscosity
throw
it
on
the
misnomer
pile
with
chocolate
indulgence
very
enjoyable
moniker
aside
continuinggetting
a
lot
more
bittersweet
chocolate
now
roasted
maltiness
even
a
licorice
not
boozy
at
all
has
a
great
aftertaste
that
lingers
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
mild
complexity
nice
and
tasty
light
to
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
seems
to
be
lacking
somewhat
in
body
this
was
fairly
enjoyable
but
a
little
light
for
the
style
and
not
one
of
my
favorites
overall
good
to
try
but
i
probably
wont
come
back
for
more
i
was
hoping
to
have
my
socks
knocked
off
by
old
engine
oil
because
i
just
bought
a
bottle
of
ola
dubh
16
old
oil
wasnt
bad
but
im
not
sure
i
justified
the
purchase
of
what
is
basically
an
aged
old
oil
for
9
bucks
oh
well
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
this
great
beer
on
tap
at
the
lions
pride
in
brunswick
the
beer
has
a
strong
head
off
the
tap
with
a
good
smoke
and
hints
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
the
taste
has
a
nice
smoke
to
it
with
a
slight
coffee
quality
i
thought
the
beer
was
beautiful
d
overall
a
nice
beer
more
roasted
and
more
chocolate
than
the
style
would
suggest
closer
to
a
stout
than
an
old
ale
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
most
of
the
old
ales
that
ive
had
have
been
more
like
barleywines
but
this
one
is
more
stoutlike
which
i
expected
since
the
label
reads
viscous
chocolaty
roasty
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
and
seemed
to
handle
the
age
quite
well
i
could
see
the
correlation
with
a
scotch
ale
it
has
a
roasty
smokey
peaty
and
slightly
burnt
flavor
not
quite
old
engine
oil
in
color
and
viscousity
unless
it
is
somewhat
fresh
and
hot
engine
oil
very
small
head
forms
and
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
very
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
likewise
that
of
a
scotch
ale
maybe
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
region
it
is
brewed
roasted
malt
is
the
dominant
aroma
along
with
some
smokiness
not
overly
complex
in
aroma
or
flavor
medium
body
with
nice
carbonation
makes
it
pleasant
to
drink
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
much
more
complex
without
the
benefit
of
barrel
aging
harviestons
old
ales
lack
the
little
extra
something
to
take
them
to
the
next
level
overall
disappointing
beer
feels
like
drinking
bitter
water
what
a
shame
highly
overrated
in
my
opinion
overall
a
decent
beer
a
little
too
smoked
and
bitter
but
worthy
of
drinking
for
sure
was
purchasing
harviestouns
twisted
and
bitter
and
the
clerk
talked
me
into
this
looks
good
black
and
lacey
smells
interesting
dark
and
mysterious
taste
is
heavy
on
the
smoke
really
dominates
and
pushes
everything
else
aside
too
much
black
patent
malt
for
my
tbuds
doubtfull
ill
indulge
again
tho
its
impressive
theyve
packed
this
much
flavor
into
a
6
tipple
its
all
smokestack
served
very
cold
with
a
dark
black
appearance
and
hardly
even
a
hint
of
a
head
but
some
spatterings
of
deep
tan
film
were
apparent
smell
was
a
little
roasty
a
little
sweet
a
little
smoky
not
much
of
anything
in
particular
taste
was
about
the
same
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
watery
not
impressed
with
it
drinkability
was
fine
good
beer
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
was
only
the
second
old
ale
i
have
had
and
it
was
nothing
like
the
first
i
had
reminded
me
of
a
really
good
stout
would
definitely
buy
again
well
balanced
beer
that
manages
to
get
tons
of
flavour
from
the
roasted
malts
without
any
unpleasant
acidity
or
astringency
one
of
the
best
stouts
that
ive
tried
pours
a
beautiful
inky
black
brew
impenetrable
to
light
with
a
one
finger
mocha
color
head
with
a
mix
of
both
large
and
fine
bubbles
there
is
minimal
head
retention
that
gives
way
to
an
even
blanket
of
fine
lace
this
old
ale
style
gives
off
a
nice
roasty
chocolate
smell
with
some
caramel
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
pretty
unassuming
almost
subtle
first
up
roasted
malt
flavors
and
some
dark
chocolate
dark
fruit
is
released
on
the
palate
as
the
beer
warms
up
some
plum
vinous
qualities
and
raisin
give
way
to
a
bittersweet
finish
this
beer
has
a
surprisingly
lighter
body
than
i
expected
from
the
look
of
the
beer
it
had
that
deep
thick
black
appearance
that
an
imperial
stout
has
but
this
beer
was
relatively
light
and
creamy
with
minimal
stick
on
the
palate
and
only
some
heat
in
the
finished
which
perhaps
has
mellowed
with
age
this
beer
was
a
very
nice
drink
it
has
that
thick
beauty
to
it
without
the
heavy
follow
through
on
the
palate
i
would
describe
it
to
someone
as
a
more
roasty
robustly
dark
chocolate
guinness
which
is
never
a
bad
thing
d
i
dont
know
if
this
is
the
base
beer
for
the
ola
dubh
series
but
on
its
own
its
a
pretty
tasty
beer
that
seems
wellsuited
to
the
whiskey
casks
they
foist
upon
it
my
buddy
seemed
to
be
less
impressed
than
i
was
but
as
a
drinkable
porter
deal
this
certainly
satisfies
not
exactly
outstanding
in
the
old
ale
category
though
review
from
notes
taken
on
10209
d
decent
oatmeal
stout
how
i
would
class
it
based
on
flavour
and
oats
in
the
ingredients
but
not
as
complex
and
smooth
as
my
beloved
stambroise
d
quite
good
since
its
not
that
strong
compared
to
imperial
styles
or
barley
wines
for
example
though
very
fullbodied
all
in
all
this
is
a
well
done
old
ale
roasty
bittersweet
enough
elements
to
keep
it
interesting
would
pick
up
another
one
of
these
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
the
style
i
think
this
marks
my
first
in
the
old
ale
category
but
i
am
excited
to
go
out
for
more
this
one
hits
my
mark
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
completely
opaque
black
with
a
thick
dark
red
head
the
head
clung
to
the
sides
nicely
and
left
a
thin
layer
on
top
aroma
was
sweet
akin
to
a
dark
chocolate
with
a
small
bit
of
oatmeal
taste
was
sweet
slightly
milky
melt
a
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
but
yet
still
had
body
and
texture
pleasant
to
drink
but
the
abv
hit
surprisingly
fast
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
and
its
definitely
worth
a
try
ill
definitely
seek
out
some
other
offerings
from
harviestoun
while
im
in
scotland
drinkability
well
i
doubt
i
ever
drink
this
again
unless
its
free
high
price
tag
for
black
pils
pass
d
excellent
flavor
but
everything
else
about
the
brew
was
quite
average
poured
black
allowing
no
light
to
shine
through
thin
mocha
head
appeared
on
top
and
dissapeared
pretty
quickly
leaving
only
a
couple
bubbles
on
top
smell
is
dark
chocolate
unripe
fruits
and
burnt
malt
similar
to
a
dry
stout
but
more
fruity
burnt
malt
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
up
front
in
the
taste
finishes
with
some
dark
fruits
and
and
some
hop
bitterness
complex
actually
leaves
some
sweet
notes
on
the
tongue
afterwards
as
opposed
to
the
bitterness
after
stouts
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
viscous
low
carbonation
overall
a
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
beer
this
is
truly
a
special
beer
full
of
flavor
without
becoming
syrupy
thoroughly
drinkable
and
interesting
to
drink
with
each
new
bottle
great
for
sipping
from
a
pint
glass
on
a
cold
wintry
night
i
dream
of
one
day
finding
this
on
tap
as
that
would
really
make
for
a
memorable
moment
looking
for
a
dry
irish
stout
brewed
in
scotland
here
it
is
and
it
a
very
good
example
of
one
btw
this
is
not
a
old
ale
d
i
think
i
could
drink
this
all
night
its
really
very
good
in
every
aspect
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
ive
loved
it
every
time
ive
had
it
drinklability
beautifully
silky
ale
with
rich
and
moreish
flavours
most
people
who
know
anything
about
beer
will
have
already
tried
this
if
you
havent
then
you
should
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
quite
fine
delicious
perfectly
balanced
and
incredibly
drinkable
ive
had
this
a
few
times
before
once
on
tap
at
nicholsons
in
cincinnati
and
each
time
i
have
it
i
am
reminded
of
why
so
many
people
buzz
about
this
beer
it
is
worthy
seams
closer
to
a
light
stout
then
an
old
ale
as
far
as
color
and
flavour
profile
still
gets
some
pretty
high
marks
though
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
fantastic
i
will
have
to
get
this
one
again
in
the
future
a
remarkably
easy
quaff
especially
for
its
style
i
found
it
to
be
a
fine
accompaniment
with
lunch
on
a
cold
sunny
day
however
it
may
suffer
slightly
from
the
hype
i
have
a
couple
of
bottles
back
home
one
for
now
and
one
to
age
a
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
regardless
dont
let
it
stop
you
from
trying
it
not
a
big
mouth
feel
on
this
one
but
conversely
is
easy
to
sip
down
pretty
quickly
also
not
too
strong
to
say
yes
to
a
2nd
got
this
one
on
a
whim
one
night
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
i
just
wanted
to
try
a
brew
from
scotland
it
was
shockingly
black
when
poured
literally
looks
like
oil
the
head
was
a
wimpy
beige
colour
and
was
basically
gone
in
a
short
while
the
smell
is
nice
chocolate
and
coffee
malty
and
roasty
as
advertised
hah
the
taste
offers
more
of
the
roasty
coffee
with
only
a
hint
of
chocolate
it
was
surprisingly
thin
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
very
light
carbonation
and
smooth
but
not
as
thick
i
imagined
this
went
down
easy
and
wasnt
too
heavy
i
imagine
you
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
a
pleasant
find
d
dont
be
scared
off
by
the
labelname
claiming
how
thick
it
is
this
isnt
a
oneanddone
drink
if
you
want
to
have
a
few
i
dont
know
if
its
my
style
for
a
session
beer
but
would
be
able
to
have
2
or
even
3
of
these
in
a
row
without
issue
d
not
hard
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
never
really
becomes
prevalent
i
think
if
you
enjoy
coffee
beers
or
beers
that
are
very
forward
with
their
roasted
overtones
old
engine
oil
is
probably
right
up
your
alley
a
nice
english
porter
that
mirrors
many
flavors
that
i
happen
to
enjoy
in
stouts
which
makes
this
ale
a
nice
bridge
between
the
styles
in
terms
of
english
porters
i
think
i
would
give
a
slight
nod
to
this
over
sam
smiths
taddy
porter
if
only
because
old
engine
old
just
seemed
to
have
a
more
robust
profile
on
both
the
nose
and
the
palate
however
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
the
two
side
by
side
for
a
more
accurate
comparison
nor
would
i
mind
seeing
how
the
vintage
whisky
barrelaged
aged
old
engine
oils
stack
up
i
have
to
say
with
the
name
i
was
expecting
a
little
thicker
with
a
little
more
chocolate
flavors
but
i
have
to
say
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
eidt
the
warmer
this
got
the
worse
it
tasted
no
depth
no
melding
of
the
flavors
ended
up
drainpouring
half
the
bottle
im
baffled
as
to
the
appeal
of
this
beer
great
beer
with
lots
of
flavour
really
good
for
a
beer
that
clocks
in
at
6
great
on
a
cold
winters
day
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
decent
dessert
beer
notes
a
highly
drinkable
black
ale
smells
like
and
tastes
up
front
like
an
imperial
russian
stout
but
the
midpalate
and
finish
are
like
the
headiest
black
lager
youve
ever
had
crazy
amount
of
malt
and
flavor
for
being
only
6
highly
recommend
d
for
as
heavy
and
ruch
as
this
beer
is
and
it
may
be
one
of
the
richest
ive
ever
had
its
very
drinkable
im
sure
a
few
would
do
some
damage
but
id
love
every
second
of
it
drinkability
much
more
drinkable
than
it
looks
and
smells
poured
black
and
smells
toasted
and
like
coffee
tastes
malty
and
roasted
with
a
combo
of
chocolate
coffee
malt
and
hops
that
gives
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
roasted
flavor
dominates
but
the
beer
is
smooth
and
light
like
an
ale
yet
feels
and
tastes
like
a
stoutporter
overall
a
very
good
combination
and
a
very
good
beer
dnothing
to
separate
this
beer
from
the
pack
just
a
nice
drinking
but
boring
ale
i
was
scared
to
try
this
because
it
sounds
like
it
would
be
black
and
thick
and
bitter
but
the
name
was
so
cool
the
blackbrownruby
color
was
really
beautiful
and
it
turned
out
to
be
much
less
intimidating
in
aroma
and
taste
than
expected
there
were
lots
of
dark
roasted
scents
and
flavors
malts
chocolate
grains
coffee
raisins
unfortunately
the
nice
flavor
profile
was
kind
of
let
down
by
the
thin
feel
of
the
beer
a
little
more
body
would
carry
them
better
overall
it
was
drinkable
but
tasted
a
little
weaker
than
i
would
have
liked
but
id
definitely
order
it
again
call
it
an
old
ale
call
it
a
porter
or
a
stout
call
it
whatever
youd
like
this
is
a
fine
beer
it
is
rich
and
gratifying
a
fulfilling
beer
worthy
of
always
keeping
on
hand
in
the
cellar
and
its
a
little
like
the
old
model
ford
car
on
its
label
its
big
loud
chunky
and
above
all
else
reliable
they
simply
dont
make
em
like
this
anymore
this
is
a
beer
that
never
wows
me
in
any
area
yet
i
come
away
from
it
having
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
ill
never
turn
one
down
thats
for
sure
i
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thicker
but
thats
my
only
complaint
with
this
beer
while
i
do
enjoy
this
brew
and
will
drink
it
again
when
given
the
chance
it
does
not
live
up
to
its
name
sadly
i
expected
so
much
more
thick
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
heavy
enough
to
be
fulfilling
without
being
overwhelming
for
such
a
robust
beer
it
was
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
it
went
well
with
a
basic
meal
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
too
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
more
i
dont
like
it
thanks
to
viggo
for
the
bottle
quite
good
and
ill
probably
buy
it
again
conclusion
so
simple
so
smooth
so
rewarding
one
of
those
beers
that
knocks
your
socks
off
without
really
awing
you
in
any
distinct
way
its
not
a
kick
in
the
teeth
like
a
bigfoot
or
a
differentflavoraminute
complexity
like
hennepin
its
just
so
simple
understated
smooth
and
delicious
ive
had
chocolate
porters
and
chocolate
stouts
made
with
real
chocolate
that
dont
come
close
to
the
cocoa
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
brew
damn
good
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
from
a
cask
at
a
beer
festival
in
edinburgh
appears
thick
and
black
in
the
glass
rather
opaque
actually
very
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
bitter
roasted
flavour
with
some
chocolate
sweetness
nice
aftertaste
as
well
i
would
have
this
one
again
old
engine
oil
is
an
impressive
old
ale
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
itd
benefit
from
more
punch
in
the
aromatics
department
the
flavor
could
be
improved
by
somehow
adjusting
the
acidic
flavor
its
more
than
solid
in
all
other
respects
definitely
recommended
overall
a
delicious
beer
its
listed
as
an
old
ale
but
i
would
consider
it
a
cross
between
a
traditional
scottish
wee
heavy
and
a
robust
porter
it
has
that
caramelized
sweetness
up
front
but
porterlike
roastiness
i
would
guess
roast
barley
and
the
results
are
quite
tasty
definitely
one
to
seek
out
overall
a
solid
beer
with
a
name
like
old
engine
oil
i
was
hoping
for
this
to
be
a
very
thick
viscous
beer
which
it
was
not
however
i
was
still
very
satisfied
and
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
cheers
everyone
this
poured
a
clear
black
ruby
with
a
bit
of
tan
head
it
smelled
like
brown
sugar
honey
wheat
and
raisins
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
barley
and
oak
it
tasted
like
roasted
barley
with
some
coffee
and
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
oak
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
decent
old
ale
but
not
the
best
the
flavor
wasnt
as
sweet
as
the
scent
which
is
a
shame
the
body
was
good
but
i
would
have
preferred
it
to
be
fuller
it
was
clean
and
easy
to
drink
especially
since
its
a
relatively
low
abv
for
old
ales
i
imagine
this
is
what
old
ales
used
to
be
like
a
long
time
ago
when
they
were
a
primary
ingredient
to
porters
modern
old
ales
seem
to
have
more
of
a
barleywine
character
to
them
which
i
prefer
this
beer
didnt
really
have
anything
wrong
with
it
but
it
was
somewhat
boring
and
forgettable
d
at
6
alcohol
this
one
is
very
drinkable
as
always
id
like
to
give
it
a
whirl
from
the
tap
drinkability
what
i
got
and
what
i
was
expecting
were
two
different
things
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
old
ale
and
perhaps
my
favorite
i
have
tried
in
the
style
more
complex
than
i
have
described
i
will
reach
for
this
again
d
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
somewhere
around
here
fat
chance
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
can
be
enjoyed
thoroughly
as
everything
about
the
beer
was
nice
highly
recommend
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
maybe
a
little
bit
more
watery
than
expected
moderate
to
low
carbonation
m
it
could
be
a
tad
creamier
and
thicker
i
bet
the
beer
is
better
from
a
cask
but
thats
probably
true
for
most
british
beers
this
beer
is
different
than
anything
i
have
i
had
and
i
like
it
malty
earthy
and
bitter
components
all
melded
together
in
a
way
that
i
have
not
experienced
the
pour
was
a
very
dark
black
with
the
look
of
a
porter
but
almost
no
head
the
aroma
was
extremely
interesting
and
nothing
like
i
had
experienced
before
it
had
a
mixture
of
floral
hops
chocolate
raisin
and
brandy
or
some
kind
of
hard
liquor
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
bold
the
taste
had
a
dose
of
hops
coffee
grounds
and
grain
it
is
very
pungent
i
can
see
where
they
get
the
name
egine
oil
but
boy
it
was
a
good
experience
overall
a
really
decent
brew
from
the
bottle
shaped
like
a
piston
to
the
description
on
the
back
everything
matches
this
beer
perfectly
when
they
say
smooth
they
mean
it
something
a
little
bit
more
pronounced
in
flavour
and
i
would
have
given
this
a
solid
a
nonetheless
one
i
look
forward
to
getting
again
thick
full
bodied
flavorful
balanced
and
drinkable
what
else
is
there
to
say
great
stuff
d
oh
my
yes
overall
good
beer
i
like
the
mixture
of
sweetness
with
the
bitterness
that
makes
it
seem
to
have
a
dry
finish
it
is
heavy
but
not
too
heavy
i
would
not
drink
a
bunch
of
them
but
i
doubt
thats
the
brewers
intnet
this
is
a
good
beer
to
savor
and
enjoy
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
and
more
as
it
warmed
up
a
solid
choice
d
everything
comes
together
to
make
a
highly
enjoyable
dark
beer
d
fair
the
bitter
aftertaste
keeps
it
to
12beers
before
it
would
be
a
little
overpowering
outstanding
old
ale
a
dark
brew
that
stops
just
short
of
a
stout
doesnt
get
any
better
chocolately
and
viscous
throughout
and
a
hint
of
licorce
on
the
back
side
weighs
nicely
on
the
tongue
before
hitting
the
palate
the
amount
of
alcohol
is
just
right
the
scots
do
it
again
beer
bliss
d
highly
drinkable
well
balanced
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
d
highly
drinkable
although
i
might
consider
this
more
of
a
dessert
beer
most
english
ales
are
quite
quaffable
and
this
is
no
different
on
tap
tonight
at
deep
ellum
served
in
a
proper
harviestoun
old
engine
oil
chalice
very
nice
light
black
color
shades
of
charcoal
decent
sized
white
head
smelled
a
bit
like
molasses
and
peat
taste
was
good
and
a
bit
unusual
for
the
style
had
an
earthy
whisky
bittersweet
chocolate
flavor
to
it
a
bit
different
flavor
than
other
old
ales
ive
tasted
which
made
this
one
stand
out
a
bit
smooth
body
made
this
a
pleasure
to
sip
this
beer
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
a
top
notch
offering
from
this
scottish
brewer
final
thoughts
before
drinking
this
beer
i
saw
it
on
ba
and
thought
how
can
a
beer
called
old
engine
oil
be
a
grade
a
beer
even
more
so
since
i
figured
that
it
would
be
thick
rich
and
excessively
bitter
fortune
smiled
on
me
and
i
saw
a
bottle
of
it
at
the
liquor
store
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
and
save
it
for
a
rainy
day
that
rainy
day
came
today
and
i
was
very
impressed
and
pleased
im
certainly
going
to
buy
this
stuff
again
and
see
if
i
can
get
some
buddies
to
give
it
a
shot
drinkability
if
it
werent
for
the
cost
8
00
for
a
12oz
bottle
id
order
this
again
loved
the
smell
and
liked
the
other
aspects
of
it
not
my
favorite
old
ale
but
a
pretty
drinkable
one
it
looked
and
tasted
like
a
porter
to
me
so
that
is
how
i
reviewed
it
delightful
though
the
burnt
finish
might
become
overwhelming
after
a
couple
its
a
smooth
beer
and
quite
drinkable
but
slightly
too
raw
on
the
back
palate
to
me
still
its
a
very
decent
drop
of
beer
with
lots
of
character
and
some
most
enjoyable
elements
drinkability
ill
stick
with
trying
more
of
the
ola
dubh
stuff
as
this
was
decent
but
nothing
was
overly
impressive
for
me
it
doesnt
seem
like
an
old
ale
as
much
as
a
dry
stout
and
there
was
a
lot
of
depth
lacking
at
what
otherwise
couldve
been
a
great
beer
the
3
price
tag
also
puts
a
bit
of
a
damper
on
me
wanting
to
ever
try
another
one
d
overall
a
pleasant
beer
not
over
powering
and
yet
fulfilling
a
great
beer
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
and
will
again
when
the
spirit
moves
me
d
deep
dark
and
delicious
notes
excellent
very
complex
aroma
and
flavor
drinkability
smooth
and
pleasant
somewhere
between
a
stout
and
an
ale
worth
pouring
again
would
be
a
beer
to
pair
with
a
chocolate
dessert
d
big
beautiful
flavors
here
that
sort
of
defy
categorization
it
reminds
me
of
an
old
ale
and
a
stout
blended
in
any
event
it
is
incredibly
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
pretty
drinkable
stuff
the
one
thing
that
detracts
is
the
more
bitter
roasted
notes
that
muddle
things
up
slightly
certainly
recommended
for
fans
of
dark
chocolaty
brews
all
in
all
this
is
an
approachable
chocolaty
brew
that
would
serve
well
for
those
looking
to
get
into
the
darker
styles
of
beer
great
drinkability
especially
for
a
bigger
beer
such
as
this
nice
balance
of
flavors
not
overly
sweet
and
not
too
bitter
i
could
easily
drink
six
of
these
in
a
night
i
poured
this
cool
name
for
a
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
black
as
it
should
be
the
head
was
a
dark
tan
color
the
lacing
was
decent
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
choclkotywith
a
bit
of
a
burnt
smell
the
beer
had
a
viscous
mouthfeel
kinda
chewy
that
i
liked
i
will
buy
again
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
a
little
on
the
watery
side
it
may
have
the
look
of
old
engine
oil
but
surely
it
does
not
have
the
consistency
the
one
area
i
will
give
the
beer
credit
towards
though
is
that
it
ends
better
than
it
starts
each
passing
mouthful
is
a
little
more
enjoyable
than
the
last
and
before
you
reach
the
end
of
your
first
glass
youll
already
be
thinking
about
your
second
concur
with
bowersdm
below
an
excellent
pour
with
great
color
aroma
flavor
and
a
nice
roasted
chocolate
aftertaste
although
pricey
at
nearly
4
for
a
16
oz
bottle
this
black
ale
is
tasty
and
enjoyable
and
it
doesnt
carry
a
heavy
flavor
like
a
stout
future
outlook
pretty
big
disappointment
this
brew
is
supposedly
ageable
but
perhaps
my
bottles
old
engine
oil
was
just
too
damn
old
ill
probably
try
this
again
but
only
if
im
certain
the
bottle
is
fresh
enough
d
its
a
good
beer
id
have
another
overall
this
is
my
first
old
ale
and
i
liked
it
if
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
drinking
i
would
confuse
it
with
strong
irish
stout
it
was
good
d
even
at
6
abv
this
is
rich
enough
as
to
make
it
a
sipper
would
be
a
good
pairing
for
a
dessert
or
cigar
if
that
is
your
inclination
i
poured
this
one
into
a
snifter
and
it
offered
a
black
brew
with
a
nice
brown
head
with
decent
retention
and
rather
quick
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
with
earthymusty
qualities
also
has
some
woody
tobacco
and
cocoa
notes
medium
body
with
prickly
carbonation
very
enjoyable
brew
pours
a
cloudy
dark
black
color
one
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
one
of
the
darkest
color
heads
ive
come
across
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
strongly
of
alcohol
and
roasted
malts
theres
also
might
be
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
aroma
so
far
as
i
can
tell
it
fits
the
style
of
an
old
ale
smooth
and
thick
mouth
feel
theres
an
average
carbonation
level
present
along
with
a
noticeable
bitterness
on
the
tongue
tastes
of
roasted
malts
first
off
then
the
alcohol
is
strong
the
aftertaste
is
of
a
malt
dryness
that
matures
into
a
slight
chocolaty
flavor
theres
a
hop
bitterness
but
not
strong
hop
flavor
along
with
the
malt
there
is
a
sweetness
to
the
brew
that
counteracts
the
malt
and
hop
bitterness
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
thats
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
thick
and
black
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
smells
of
alcohol
malt
and
some
fruit
taste
is
thick
complex
malty
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
very
smooth
much
more
drinkable
than
expected
would
drink
again
mfd
the
viscosity
of
the
brew
is
perfect
not
too
watery
not
too
thick
the
only
thing
that
could
have
been
a
bit
better
would
have
been
some
more
carbonation
that
would
have
helped
add
a
bit
more
body
to
the
brew
but
other
than
that
i
though
it
a
marvelous
beer
and
one
to
be
a
complete
paradigm
of
the
style
this
is
hohum
nothing
extravagant
but
definatly
ok
for
the
style
this
would
be
a
terrific
session
beer
but
im
not
sure
how
many
more
id
want
to
drink
with
all
that
carbonation
and
oversmoked
creal
grain
flavors
i
guess
i
had
higher
expectations
for
something
with
a
name
like
old
engine
oil
its
a
pretty
good
brew
but
definitely
not
the
best
old
ale
pours
with
virtually
zero
head
perfectly
black
color
way
too
opaque
to
gauge
amount
of
bubbles
in
the
liquid
extremely
malty
nose
bursting
with
roasted
coffee
and
nuts
scents
hardened
caramel
valrhona
chocolate
maple
syrup
and
a
glimmer
of
fig
fruit
and
buttered
corn
close
to
full
absence
of
hop
scents
curiously
lightbodied
given
the
depth
of
the
primary
flavors
glides
through
the
mouth
loaded
with
coffee
bean
mocha
powder
hazelnut
with
even
a
slight
tarry
edge
bitterness
breaks
through
during
the
midpalate
gains
traction
towards
end
and
breathes
life
into
the
whole
the
level
of
carbonation
appears
too
high
at
first
but
you
can
get
used
to
it
no
citrus
but
the
vague
dried
fruit
nuance
remains
vibrancy
of
narrow
range
of
flavors
amplifies
finish
mouthfeel
surprisingly
light
watery
and
smooth
from
the
low
carbonation
feels
good
but
it
would
be
that
much
better
if
a
little
more
creamy
good
and
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
like
an
oatmeal
stout
but
the
flavour
leans
more
towards
a
classic
english
stout
imo
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
that
would
certainly
be
best
on
cask
but
is
wonderful
and
available
in
bottled
form
flavour
is
all
cocoacoffee
and
roasty
malts
roast
beef
abounds
this
is
thick
like
engine
oil
and
a
gorgeous
beer
all
round
hoorah
for
my
ol
mate
glenn
for
bring
this
around
full
and
viscous
with
this
much
malt
you
cant
help
but
be
good
viscosity
and
attenuation
as
this
is
still
pretty
damn
drinkable
despite
being
somewhat
thorny
and
quite
different
from
what
the
american
palate
is
used
to
thanks
to
northyorksammy
for
this
extremely
drinkable
you
almost
take
beers
like
this
for
granted
because
their
complexity
is
subtle
yet
quite
deep
when
you
finally
find
it
but
your
glass
is
nearly
empty
since
its
so
easy
to
drink
top
notch
beer
in
the
british
tradition
cheers
the
carbonation
though
is
very
light
on
the
tongue
shifting
into
a
roasted
nuttiness
that
seems
to
make
laps
on
the
tongue
leaving
behind
a
bit
of
smokiness
and
some
bitterness
surprisingly
there
isnt
as
much
malty
sweetness
as
you
might
assume
with
a
beer
this
dark
while
its
there
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
drink
it
quickly
dims
to
completely
fade
away
good
and
dark
like
i
enjoy
but
nothing
overly
execptional
the
beer
was
full
bodied
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
my
only
reservation
about
spending
a
night
on
these
is
at
6
this
may
be
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
very
highly
recommended
the
best
dark
scottish
beer
i
have
ever
tried
mouthfeel

mouthfeel

good
well
rounded
black
ale
not
quite
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
stout
or
porter
but
pretty
good
worth
a
shot
rated
apr

the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
is
real
smooth
and
velvety
there
is
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
that
accompanies
the
second
half
down
the
throat
i
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
better
old
ales
i
have
consumed
you
really
get
the
caramel
and
toffee
coming
though
most
of
the
drink
this
one
is
worth
buying
again
for
sure
nice
and
dark
i
like
the
dark
ones
near
black
brown
stout
but
thinner
quite
a
creamy
head
latte
in
color
nose
is
a
good
malt
and
fruit
the
taste
is
bitter
to
compare
to
a
stout
i
cant
really
figure
to
coin
it
as
anything
other
than
a
stale
bitter
tobacco
like
soft
chocolate
buttery
the
gentle
fruit
works
great
with
the
bitter
quality
a
soft
leather
and
chalk
also
great
stuff
i
think
it
may
become
a
winter
regular
at
3
bucks
a
bottle
d
as
i
said
this
beer
isnt
necessarily
in
keeping
with
an
old
ale
but
its
still
tasty
and
well
made
subtle
complex
black
pour
with
a
tan
ring
of
bubbles
roasted
malt
and
nuts
bittersweet
chocolate
prunes
and
coffee
not
as
viscous
as
advertised
woody
burnt
oats
malt
raisins
barley
weak
coffee
and
just
a
little
bit
of
smoke
i
expected
a
stout
with
the
name
and
look
but
got
a
very
good
old
ale
instead
drinkability
a
well
blended
and
very
flavorful
ale
i
have
heard
much
about
his
one
and
was
glad
to
finally
taste
it
while
i
would
equate
the
flavor
profile
more
with
a
stout
than
an
old
ale
this
is
which
i
will
revisit
d
not
an
old
ale
in
my
book
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
european
beer
for
the
abv
i
was
kind
of
surprised
at
home
much
of
a
sipper
this
was
easily
drinkable
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
d
a
very
nice
sipper
for
this
cold
night
even
though
im
inside
but
you
get
the
idea
a
thinnish
black
body
with
a
wellcarbonated
onefinger
head
that
slowly
died
and
left
little
lace
patches
an
extreme
coffee
malt
smell
along
with
maybe
some
roasted
and
toffee
malts
and
hints
of
cocoa
while
thick
and
fullbodied
this
beer
is
real
smooth
and
creamy
the
taste
is
a
mixture
of
unsweet
cocoa
and
roasted
malts
with
a
slick
and
semidry
backbite
mild
dark
fruit
and
hop
presence
in
this
beer
but
the
malts
are
predominant
this
is
a
musthave
for
any
beer
drinker
all
in
all
an
awesome
ale
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
of
these
i
would
advise
putting
any
hesitation
aside
poured
jet
black
name
says
it
all
had
a
nice
tan
head
on
it
with
some
good
carbonation
nose
of
chocolate
toffee
and
tastes
the
same
and
perhaps
some
black
liqourice
i
have
better
old
ales
looks
better
than
it
tastes
but
still
an
ok
brew
i
am
used
to
my
old
ales
being
a
little
stronger
i
suppose
very
drinkable
although
the
2
99
for
11
2
oz
seems
a
bit
high
for
this
one
overall
not
bad
and
would
pickup
a
few
more
if
i
find
it
for
a
dollar
less
d
the
complexity
of
this
beer
alone
is
enough
to
warrant
a
5
but
i
just
cant
bring
myself
to
do
it
the
mouthfeel
needs
to
beer
there
more
its
just
not
substantial
enough
for
me
other
than
that
anyone
who
has
access
to
this
beer
and
has
never
tried
it
should
pick
up
a
few
bottles
of
this
right
now
it
has
tons
to
offer
go
go
now
what
are
you
waiting
for
d
nice
offering
like
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
very
tasty
full
flavored
old
ale
that
is
clearly
in
porter
and
stout
territory
harviestoun
basically
could
have
called
this
any
of
the
three
and
with
the
smokiness
could
have
even
gone
with
wee
heavy
regardless
its
a
damn
good
dark
ale
which
is
actually
all
the
label
claims
black
ale
i
like
that
its
so
robust
without
being
over
the
top
abv
wise
pretty
nice
price
for
this
rarity
to
boot

poured
an

the

slightly

not
super

very
very

to
the

d
i
think
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
very
satisfying
evening
drink
its
not
a
session
beer
but
it
isnt
intended
to
be
for
me
its
a
trip
back
in
time
i
am
currently
reading
a
history
of
suds
and
civilization
from
mesopotamia
to
microbreweries
by
gregg
smith
and
i
can
just
imagine
being
at
an
old
inn
drinking
one
of
these
read
the
book
youll
get
what
i
mean
d
while
this
is
not
a
session
beer
it
is
very
rich
and
flavorful
as
it
says
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
it
would
be
good
after
dinner
a
tasty
dark
ale
ive
seen
this
on
the
shelves
forever
never
tried
it
no
more
ill
be
back
frequently
if
no
ola
dubh
is
available
go
for
this
especially
as
a
chaser
for
your
top
shelf
single
malt
of
choice
although
carrying
a
sweetness
that
would
align
it
with
chocolate
coffee
the
bitterness
char
notes
make
me
think
smoked
meats
salamis
and
other
charcuterie
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
silky
with
low
carbonation
the
name
of
this
beer
really
does
reflect
its
characteristics
black
viscous
smooth
and
socially
lubricating
d
quite
drinkable
the
taste
is
rich
but
zesty
and
also
mellow
and
very
smooth
its
similar
to
the
aroma
with
light
chocolate
fruit
and
stewed
prunes
brown
bread
toast
earthy
leaves
a
hitn
of
red
wine
and
licorice

up

drying

finish
along
with
a
gentle

im
trying
to
relate
it
to
a
definitive
style
i
am
familiar
with
it
strikes
me
as
a
cross
between
a

unique
and

most
complex

beer
i
can
think
of
very
nice
d
a
little
strong
with
the
burnt
and
bitter
flavors
for
my
tastes
but
still
a
very
tasty
and
smooth
beverage
drinks
a
bit
slow
due
to
the
dryness
i
do
see
this
more
as
a
stout
but
most
brits
would
likely
say
this
this
is
too
strong
for
starters
not
a
bad
night
cap
but
prefer
the
reserve

in
whisky

with
hardly
any

thick
syrupy

dark

an
emphasis
on
chocolate
bitter
dark
chocolate
taste
mostly
reflects
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
oily
with
soft
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer

i
wasnt

impressed

the
taste
starts
wih
some
cheap
coffee
and
hints
of
coca
beans
very
dry
these
darker
flavors
mix
with
the
viney
nature
ofthis
beer
in
a
very
interesting
melange
although
the
avis

6
this
is
a
sipping
beer
not
sessionable
at
all
in
my
opinion
pretty
tart
but
complexly
malty
what
can
i
say
its
rich
with
both
chocolate
and
fruit
flavors
while
being
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
this
is
a
delicious
beer
a
musttry
d
enjoyable
brew
overall
fairly
complex
and
it
tends
to
grow
on
you
a
bit
as
it
warms
still
im
not
crazy
about
this
one
but
i
can
see
how
so
many
are
would
drink
again
ill
have
another
pours
to
a
thin
dirty
tan
head
and
deep
ruby
black
color
aroma
is
chocolate
creamy
malts
vanilla
extract
and
sweet
alcohol
flavor
is
a
perfect
blend
of
malt
sweetness
caramel
and
vanilla
and
chocolate
malts
good
thick
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
dark
aleno
tongue
fatigue
from
lingering
roast
or
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
very
well
made
old
ale
that
really
drinks
like
a
good
cream
stout
interesting
beer
but
not
what
iwould
expect
out
of
an
old
ale
overall
a
rich
delicious
ale
that
definitly
leaves
its
mark
on
your
memory
nice
and
complex
but
still
retains
the
ability
to
let
you
sit
back
and
relax
with
a
couple
a
fine
ale
and
definitly
something
i
will
be
buying
more
of
11
2oz
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
poured
a
deep
brownblack
with
a
finger
of
tan
fine
bubbled
head
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
some
chocolate
and
a
little
fruit
roasted
barley
and
some
malty
sweetness
body
was
a
little
thin
for
a
beer
that
calls
itself
engine
oil
there
are
some
hops
in
there
but
most
of
the
bitterness
comes
from
roasted
malt
nice
long
finish
d
this
is
an
interesting
old
ale
its
rather
hoppy
and
reminds
me
of
a
good
ris
definitely
syrupy
and
almost
viscous
moderate
carbonation
for
more
body
drinkability
i
recommend
an
aged
bottle
or
reserve
version
as
opposed
to
the
tap
incarnation
the
drink
settled
with
a
very
very
dark
black
color
and
a
quickly
evaporated
head
aromas
were
strongly
woody
wrapping
in
general
mocha
ingredients
the
taste
was
perfect
very
woody
malty
and
roasty
just
perfect
the
mouthfeel
was
near
perfect
with
an
excellence
in
being
a
smooth
creamy
drink
but
with
a
crisp
carbonation
overall
utterly
awesome
overall
quite
unique
but
id
usually
prefer
a
regular
english
porter
11
2oz
bottle
this
one
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
there
was
a
small
tan
head
on
it
that
dropped
off
quickly
very
little
lacing
some
chocolate
coffee
and
roastiness
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
good
it
borders
on
a
full
body
taste
is
of
chocolate
malt
some
coffee
dark
fruits
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
nice
d
very
drinkable
for
a
thick
malty
beer
i
really
loved
the
finish
it
makes
you
want
to
keep
sipping
d
a
great
hearty
drinking
beer
and
must
try
a
brooklyn
chocolate
stout
what
i
really
mean
is
that
i
wish
that
stout
had
the
same
balance
i
suppose
the
chocolate
flavor
has
something
to
do
with
it
the
abv
was
good
on
the
old
engine
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
this
was
very
interesting
with
a
ton
of
different
appealing
flavors
coming
out
unfortunately
they
all
seemed
to
crowd
each
other
a
bit
which
i
think
kept
things
from
really
jumping
out
still
this
would
be
a
very
good
post
dinner
drink
especially
paired
up
with
something
sweet
d
nice
beer
with
a
good
smooth
drinkability
very
enjoyable
and
subtle
worth
a
try
and
great
to
marinate
with
as
well
d
a
nice
beer
indeed
not
something
id
drink
all
that
often
but
worth
trying
kind
of
offensive
green
olive
smell
at
first
then
when
it
warmed
up
i
got
a
little
fruity
sweetness
pours
dark
black
and
vicious
in
nature
small
light
brown
head
that
fades
and
leaves
a
ring
tastes
of
coffee
and
smoke
and
leaves
a
dry
chalky
feel
overall
not
to
impressed
taste
is
very
bitter
almost
sour
roasted
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
dominate
the
flavors
and
the
cherry
noted
in
the
aroma
is
noticeable
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
in
my
opinion
for
something
that
is
compared
to
gloopy
car
engine
oil
on
the
bottle
but
not
bad
by
any
means
although
this
lends
itself
to
drinkability
which
it
is
very
drinkable
reminds
me
more
of
a
stout
but
whatever
it
is
its
good

a
glass
got
poured
down
the
sink
after
reading
other
reviews
i
really
cant
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
i
dont
think
ill
get
it
again
tasted
also
with
an
85
chocolate
good
pairing
d
dark
and
mildly
malty
with
a
very
strong
roast
character
kind
of
reminiscent
of
a
dry
stout
i
think
this
must
be
something
special
the
complexity
of
flavors
and
smells
alone
would
garner
this
a
very
high
rating
in
my
review
but
the
flavors
are
mysterious
and
create
the
desire
to
keep
on
contemplating
the
contents
d
notes
though
the
balance
s
clearly
sweet
the
bitterness
provides
by
the
hops
really
makes
this
a
unique
and
tasty
beer
with
solid
drinkability
this
is
a
treat
and
a
great
beer
highly
recommended
served
in
my
dfh
snifter
poured
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
some
deep
redbrown
highlights
around
the
edges
quarterinch
offwhite
head
dissipated
within
seconds
leaving
an
oily
skim
with
copious
ringlets
clustered
around
the
perimeter
of
the
bowl
only
lacing
present
was
the
ring
visible
below
the
line
of
the
brew
after
each
sip
scents
of
cocoa
and
dark
fruit
but
very
subdued
taste
similar
to
nose
with
a
malty
backbone
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
watery
a
little
carbonation
present
but
not
much
not
surprising
considering
the
lack
of
a
head
went
down
easy
and
flavors
were
fairly
wellblended
and
complementary
but
not
what
i
would
consider
a
go
to
brew
drinkability
high
on
this
it
went
down
before
i
knew
it
was
gone
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
rich
brew
with
great
flavors
and
solid
profile
that
does
not
carry
a
high
alcoholic
tag
smooth
and
mellow
with
great
complexity
excellent
cheers
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
medium
sized
flufffy
white
head
that
takes
some
time
to
settle
and
laces
the
glass
nicely
all
the
way
down
it
has
an
aroma
of
deep
roasted
malted
barley
some
chocolate
caramel
and
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
of
the
nose
the
taste
was
really
good
with
a
deep
roasted
malt
base
with
some
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
flavors
mixed
in
as
well
the
aftertaste
is
really
clean
just
a
nice
chocolatey
flavor
left
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
velvety
and
warming
very
nice
the
drinkability
is
good
especially
since
it
doesnt
have
a
very
high
alcohol
content
it
is
a
very
interesting
beer
for
an
old
ale
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
it
is
most
definately
worth
a
try
pours
a
charcoal
black
color
with
a
nice
14
inch
tan
head
dark
roasted
malts
of
chocolate
coffee
and
a
wee
bit
of
burnt
flavors
big
and
silky
but
not
as
viscous
as
i
was
hoping
for
slight
bitterness
on
the
tongue
burned
chocolate
malts
with
some
coffee
notes
light
aftertaste
wouldve
liked
to
have
seen
a
more
layered
taste
profile
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
an
excellent
beer
12oz
brown
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
an
opaque
black
body
with
a
thin
film
of
tan
head
smells
roasty
and
malty
tastes
very
roasty
with
nutty
and
earthy
hops
toward
the
finish
full
rich
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
though
definitely
more
of
a
sipper
which
is
to
be
expected
for
the
style
a
tasty
solid
ale
disappointing
i
am
happy
to
see
this
again
in
boise
now
i
want
to
drink
the
whisky
barrel
old
engine
oil
i
have
in
the
basement
side
by
side
with
this
one
i
remember
the
reserve
having
a
bunch
of
whisky
notes
but
i
could
see
how
they
can
add
a
bunch
of
complexity
to
an
already
great
beer
very
nice
drinkability
sits
very
lightly
in
the
belly
twelve
ounces
disappears
too
quickly
the
beer
offers
a
wellbalanced
flavor
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
one
of
the
most
wonderful
beers
ive
had
pours
nice
and
black
into
the
glass
and
has
a
delightful
roastytoasty
aroma
that
lasts
a
long
time
tastes
just
a
bit
bitter
with
a
roastiness
that
goes
down
very
easy
youll
find
plenty
of
tobacco
notes
as
well
the
adjectives
on
the
label
summarize
this
beer
quite
accurately
d
sort
of
but
i
dont
know
how
many
id
have
annother
great
beer
to
give
to
those
who
are
afraid
of
the
dark
truly
a
fantastic
beer
very
smooth
mouthfeel
but
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
really
silky
and
tasty
very
good
beer
d
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
all
of
the
elements
in
this
beer
are
great
and
are
really
balanced
definitely
give
this
a
shot
if
you
have
a
chance
probably
amazing
on
tap
three
words
on
the
label
sum
this
one
up
pretty
well
viscous
chocolatey
roasty
i
can
add
delicious
complex
recommended
d
off
the
proverbial
hook
i
could
session
these
a
good
beer
for
malt
lovers
i
could
only
imagine
this
being
better
on
tap
and
a
little
fresher
this
is
an
aptly
named
beer
since
it
really
does
look
like
old
engine
oil
as
it
pours
out
thick
and
viscous
into
the
glass
not
much
of
a
head
but
what
little
there
is
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
down
the
sides
the
smell
is
exceptionalmalty
and
chocolately
without
being
syrupyand
the
taste
is
even
better
strongly
chocolate
with
definite
malt
character
but
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
or
sweet
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
on
a
cold
snowy
day
its
rich
and
delicious
and
i
will
be
headed
back
to
the
lcbo
to
stock
up
before
they
run
out
very
tasty
just
short
of
4
5
drinkability
is
excellent
flavors
full
and
reminiscent
of
bigger
higher
abv
brews
so
the
6
is
appreciated
id
have
another
of
these
for
sure
body
is
creamy
carbonation
soft
it
just
needs
a
bit
more
heft
to
make
it
as
viscous
as
it
claims
briefly
sweet
before
coffee
roastiness
takes
over
sweet
chocolate
and
fruit
mingling
with
balancing
floral
bitterness
in
the
finish
good
beer
get
it
definitely
recommended
d
very
drinkable
overall
kind
of
light
i
was
expecting
something
thicker
and
heavier
try
it
to
believe
it
after
a
couple
of
minutes
its
finally
on
to
the
taste
lots
of
malty
chocolate
goodness
hop
bitterness
dark
fruits
and
earth
very
smooth
and
creamy
i
can
only
hope
we
get
this
more
often
this
is
a
fantastic
malt
bomb
of
a
beer
very
complex
yet
nuanced
and
easy
to
drink
another
winner
from
this
brewery
d
very
very
good
is
this
sessionable
hell
yeah
it
is
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
english
hops
but
drying
and
clean
the
bottom
line
old
engine
oil
is
a
tasty
example
of
an
old
ale
and
having
it
on
the
hand
pull
and
hence
also
warmer
from
the
start
undoubtedly
enhanced
my
opinion
of
it
the
beer
is
very
low
abv
for
its
style
but
that
just
makes
it
more
appropriate
for
drinking
outside
of
the
home
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
some
red
in
the
edges
super
thick
two
finger
tan
head
forms
refuses
to
leave
forms
a
very
solid
layer
nice
lacing
looks
great
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
chocolate
roast
bread
toffee
molasses
and
charred
wood
some
dark
fruits
bit
of
raisin
enjoyable
taste
is
nice
sweet
malts
toffee
chocolate
like
roast
bready
fruity
almost
sherry
in
the
finish
very
smooth
and
a
nice
roastgraininess
that
underneath
that
holds
it
together
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
definition
of
smooth
great
low
abv
beer
could
drink
these
all
night
i
will
immediately
go
pick
up
an
armful
of
this
stuff
absolutely
fantastic
pours
black
with
a
mocha
head
that
dissipates
to
leave
a
few
wispy
remnants
on
the
surface
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
slightly
bitter
and
dark
the
flavour
leads
with
a
hit
of
fruit
before
melting
into
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
a
slight
coffee
bitterness
the
mix
going
on
in
this
beer
reminded
me
a
little
of
anchor
porter
the
palate
wasnt
as
i
expected
the
image
of
engine
oil
suggested
a
very
thick
almost
syrupy
liquid
instead
the
body
was
mediumlight
but
with
a
creamy
undertone
that
suits
the
beer
well
carbonation
was
practically
nonexistent
which
i
think
is
a
good
decision
based
on
the
flavours
going
on
here
the
lighter
body
and
low
carbonation
made
this
a
very
easy
drinker
and
the
glass
was
empty
all
too
soon
i
could
easily
have
had
another
this
beer
came
as
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
surprise
it
pours
a
very
dark
thick
black
with
some
dark
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
the
smell
is
roasted
sweet
malts
some
hop
character
perhaps
a
bit
of
coffee
and
plum
or
other
heavy
fruit
the
beer
is
surprisingly
thin
and
very
drinkable
the
taste
is
bready
roasted
malts
chocolate
cocoa
some
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
but
overall
very
smooth
there
are
some
fruit
flavors
discernible
there
is
also
a
bit
of
butterscotch
in
the
body
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
and
buttery
leaving
a
coating
of
oil
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
barely
carbonated
and
goes
down
very
well
there
is
a
bit
of
hopped
up
aftertaste
but
overall
its
quite
mild
this
beer
is
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
id
certainly
have
another
d
great
drinker
a
bit
high
in
the
abv
for
a
seesion
but
a
beer
that
i
would
have
a
couple
of
in
a
sitting
drinkability
near
perfect
old
ale
i
could
sample
one
after
another
full
of
flavor
yet
easy
to
enjoy
you
are
urged
to
keep
confirming
how
delicious
it
is
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
quarter
inch
of
head
smell
is
malty
and
some
cocoa
taste
is
where
a
good
amount
of
coffee
shows
up
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
coffee
and
chocolate
this
is
a
easy
drinker
and
goes
down
very
easily
well
done
quite
similar
to
colonial
porter
perhaps
not
quite
as
delicious
but
still
an
excellent
beer
i
will
definitely
be
getting
this
again
as
it
is
a
very
smooth
tasty
drinkable
dark
beer
for
scotland
to
be
proud
of
d
very
smooth
and
rich
with
a
decent
abv
and
nice
finish
this
is
a
very
plesant
and
joyfilled
old
ale
i
will
seek
this
one
out
to
include
in
my
stash
pours
out
a
very
dark
ruby
nearly
black
with
a
frothy
tanned
head
that
leaves
very
intricate
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
fruity
with
anise
and
strains
of
roasted
malts
in
the
background
flavor
is
terribly
sweet
with
some
heavy
handed
licorice
flavor
going
on
molasses
dried
fruit
and
chocolate
are
found
in
the
underlying
flavors
roasted
malts
round
out
the
finish
finishes
sweet
mouthfeel
is
relaxed
in
carbonation
sticky
in
the
body
and
a
little
slick
this
is
ok
drinkabilitywise
but
there
is
too
much
licorice
i
think
i
like
the
whisky
barrelaged
version
a
lot
better
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
scotland
a
tasty
little
number
that
im
sure
ill
buy
again
cant
wait
to
taste
the
aged
version
aged
in
whisky
casks
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
all
respects
excellent
after
dinner
drink
pours
an
almost
opaque
black
with
no
head
nose
is
like
old
tar
from
a
tree
just
very
earthy
and
resin
like
raisins
slight
touch
of
dried
out
wood
that
still
holds
a
fragrance
flavor
is
smooth
definite
raisins
there
nice
aged
woody
flavor
thick
with
character
feel
is
good
slight
bubble
but
an
otherwise
thicker
texture
over
the
tongue
very
drinkable
more
of
a
sipper
but
a
nice
aged
old
ale
pours
a
nice
little
brown
head
and
has
a
black
color
that
you
cannot
see
through
head
falls
and
leaves
a
almost
no
lacing
behind
smell
is
chocolatey
great
with
some
wonderful
whiskey
notes
with
some
oaky
smells
taste
is
sour
very
sour
something
is
definetly
wrong
sour
with
some
small
flavors
of
roasted
malts
but
the
dominant
flavor
is
sour
there
is
some
alcohol
burn
in
the
chest
which
is
confusing
for
me
considering
its
a
6
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
but
acidic
with
bite
overall
i
wouldnt
have
another
one
immediatly
but
would
give
another
chance
actually
i
cant
finish
the
bottle
i
have
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
a
half
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
is
ok
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
however
theres
also
some
molasses
and
caramel
along
with
a
lingering
bittersweet
aftertaste
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
slick
and
smooth
drinkability
is
good
its
easy
to
drink
with
just
a
6
abv
wouldnt
be
too
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
a
good
match
for
two
the
beer
is
as
dark
as
the
name
suggests
smells
of
malts
and
some
grape
it
pours
black
thick
head
good
retention
overwhelming
roasted
maltsnot
much
of
the
chocolate
taste
that
the
bottle
suggested
mostly
roasted
malts
and
strong
sens
of
alcohol
not
well
balanced
my
type
of
beer
but
doesnt
compete
with
the
best
in
its
class
still
it
is
unusual
and
bold
i
give
it
points
for
that
so
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
of
dark
beers
generally
pours
black
with
chocolate
highlights

with
a
slim
creamy

spots
of

down
the
glass
until
the
last
sip
malty
chocolate
aroma
and
a
hint
of
rum
smooth
milky
creaminess
cherries
and
maple
syrup
although
the
mouthfeel
is
insanely
smooth
and
creamy
it
isnt
at
all
heavy
sweet
malty
flavors
bitter
chocolate
and
a
winelike
fruitiness
very
light
carbonation
and
suprisingly
drinkable
finishing
dry
smooth
mellow
and
malty
very
nice
on
a

poured
a

black
that
not
a

could
pass
through

capped
nicely
with
two
fingers
of

head
faded
somewhat
quickly
and
left
some
spotty
lace
behind
aromas
of
burnt
coffee
dark

and
roasted

my
nose
taste
was
quite
a
bit
like
the
smell
but
a
bit
better
somewhat
coffee
like
with
some
chocolate
riding
shotgun
with
plenty
of
thick
roastytoasty

flavors
any
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
finishes
rather
smooth
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
great
drinkability
had
on

at
the
brick

pub
in
decatur
ga
as
usual
poured
in
the
appropriate
glassware
poured
black
with
a
bubbly
head
some
decent
lacing
and
retention
the
smell
is
malty
with
notes
of
licorice
and
blackstrap
molasses
the
taste
is
somewhat
light
both
for
the
style
and
for
what
both
the
appearance
and
nose
suggest
mostly
detectable
are
dry
malt
and
light
noble
hops
as
well
as
a
slight
roastiness
none
of
the
aroma
notes
make
it
into
the
flavor
really
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
this
an
easy
sipper
but
there
is
not
a
lot
of
depth
here
poured

tiny

the

there
is

thing
going
on
for
a

abv

there
is
some

goind
down
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
old
ale
recommended
wow
pours
great
an
excellent
pitch
color
that
reminds
me
of
a
nice
dark
stout
along
with
the
slightly
tan
head
although
the
head
isnt
as
thick
as
a
stout
nor
the
lacing
as
strong
it
has
a
fantastic
aroma
a
great
combination
of
chocolate
coffee
roasted
barley
and
even
a
bit
of
oakiness
it
has
a
fantastic
taste
a
bit
of
coffee
a
bit
of
roasted
barley
and
oats
its
like
some
fantastic
combination
of
a
stout
and
a
scotch
ale
but
with
a
nice
slight
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
as
opposed
to
the
usual
maltiness
of
the
other
two
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
overall
just
wonderful
drinkability
good
but
nothing
spectacular
rather
spend
the
money
on
a
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
in
the
same
price
range
d
if
i
had
all
night
to
spend
at
the
brick
store
i
could
have
done
this
one
all
night
long
as
it
were
its
now
on
my
list
of
i
want
that
one
again
i
had
this
after
dinner
and
while
it
was
a
decent
postmeal
beer
it
didnt
exactly
knock
my
socks
off
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
feel
the
need
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
there
are
better
beers
for
less
money
out
there
finish
is
a
little
chalky
and
alcoholic
this
beer
is
very
dark
in
color
and
holds
a
chocolate
head
for
a
good
amount
of
time
the
smell
is
of
deep
roasted
coffee
beans
with
hints
of
chocolate
lacing
and
almost
a
metallic
luster
the
taste
is
rich
with
malt
and
sweetness
at
first
and
finishes
with
a
crisp
but
subtle
bite
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
thick
but
a
little
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
decent
for
this
type
of
beer
tasting
it
at
about
54
degrees
coffee
is
taken
back
a
bit
by
some
prune
and
date
tastes
chocolate
appears
towards
the
end
a
bit
sour
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
brew
a
bit
dry
adds
to
the
bitterness
making
it
slighlty
tough
to
drink
but
it
does
leave
a
nice
taste
overall
recommended
an
interesting
old
ale
and
an
altogether
tasty
beer
im
not
sure
its
a
personal
favorite
but
i
must
admit
it
is
well
done
coffee
brown
body
topped
by
a
small
tan
head
that
leaves
just
a
smattering
of
lacing
and
almost
no
halo
after
its
all
too
speedy
descent
only
a
bit
of
carbonation
visible
smell
is
watery
but
caramel
and
roast
malt
notes
make
it
through
taste
is
malt
and
roast
sour
lactic
a
bit
of
caramel
and
raisin
especially
in
the
aftertaste
thick
and
warming
mouthfeel
okay
nothing
special
the
bottle
calls
this
a
delicious
after
dinner
beer
and
i
couldnt
agree
more
a
perfect
beer
to
go
with
a
nice
cigar
after
an
enjoyable
meal
unique
and
nothing
like
i
expected
i
will
definately
pick
up
again
even
to
share
with
company
this
beer
is
black
as
the
name
would
imply
with
a
1
finger
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
strong
of
malt
with
some
hints
of
spice
the
taste
is
roasted
coffee
malty
and
bittersweet
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
falls
short
of
the
chewy
i
was
expecting
from
the
name
i
dont
think
id
put
this
in
my
car
but
i
would
put
it
in
me

and
often
drinkability
smooth
and
balanced
strong
flavors
but
enjoyable
old
engine
oil
was
opaque
black
in
color
with
a
little
ruby
when
held
to
a
light
the
light
tan
head
was
medium
in
size
with
decent
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
loaded
with
dark
malts
coffee
chocolate
caramel
and
a
little
fruit
the
taste
was
about
the
same
as
the
aroma
with
some
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
a
balancing
bitterness
and
long
dry
finish
it
was
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
was
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
have
to
try
again
d
not
a
bad
beer
pretty
enjoyable
remarkably
easydrinking
for
as
big
as
it
first
starts
out
as
worth
a
try
overall
there
isnt
anything
about
this
beer
that
i
absolutely
love
but
i
do
not
find
anything
wrong
with
it
if
i
wanted
to
be
a
real
stickler
id
say
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
full
enough
but
this
isnt
a
stout
i
think
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
though
i
like
others
more
that
have
a
lower
score
i
gave
i
find
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
deserves
much
credit
my
impression
is
that
this
beer
is
very
porterlike
which
would
probably
explain
why
i
enjoy
this
beer
based
on
what
i
know
of
the
style
its
very
accurate
and
a
fine
specimen
of
a
beer
the
drinkability
is
excellent
much
better
than
you
would
think
engine
oil
would
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
a
little
on
the
creamy
side
with
a
very
smooth
carbonation
that
only
helps
out
in
the
drinkability
department
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
did
the
version
aged
in
whiskey
barrels
d
this
is
awesome
i
can
only
fantasize
about
what
this
must
be
like
on
tap
draft
pour
into
a
shaker
glass
very
dark
nearly
opaque
light
tan
head
smell
flavor
are
full
of
wonderful
london
porter
or
sweet
stout
type
elements
of
toffee
dark
fruit
and
roastytoasty
malt
flavors
such
as
chocolate
body
is
rich
and
smooth
pleasant
quite
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
sweetermaltier
dark
ales
pours
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
dark
tan
small
head
that
leaves
a
nice
thin
lace
behind
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
in
the
nose
also
a
bit
earthy
tastes
is
again
a
bit
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
mild
bitterness
to
it
feels
smooth
and
full
in
the
mouth
without
too
much
carbonation
overall
a
nice
dark
beer
that
i
do
believe
ill
have
again
medium
bodied
and
very
creamy
with
fine
pinpoint
carbonation
and
a
smooth
buttery
texture
drinkability
of
a
session
beer
this
beer
becomes
exceptional
once
it
crosses
your
lips
very
rich
blend
of
flavors
starts
with
sweet
cream
becomes
cognac
and
finishes
with
roasty
chocolate
malts
yummo
wonderful
mouthfeel
the
minimal
carbonation
was
fine
considering
the
full
body
and
the
crisp
finish
if
i
could
find
a
place
to
pick
up
a
case
of
this
at
a
reasonable
price
id
be
on
it
in
a
minute
smooth
and
intensely
flavorful
harviestoun
is
a
new
reason
to
go
to
scotland
next
must
hunt
down
the
barrelaged
one
again
i
remember
it
having
an
amazing
peat
flavor
that
offset
the
sweetness
old
ale
i
dont
know
but
here
we
go
pours
nearly
pitch
black
small
brown
head
accompanies
it
smells
a
bit
sweet
with
some
soapy
essence
tastes
a
lot
better
though
caramel
cocoa
malty
goodness
and
a
slight
hint
of
dryness
in
the
finish
overall
its
a
really
nice
beer
to
me
though
this
is
like
a
really
nice
porter
rather
than
an
old
ale
in
the
way
of
flavor
and
appearence
but
what
the
hey
if
the
scots
want
to
call
it
an
old
ale
an
old
ale
itll
be
drinkability
is
great
with
this
one
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
have
again
d
somewhat
leans
toward
an
extreme
but
if
you
were
to
be
drink
big
malt
brews
all
night
this
one
would
kick
you
right
back
into
the
swing
of
things
with
its
composition
the
rarity
of
combining
two
malt
beverages
beer
and
scotch
is
whats
charming
about
this
beer
i
see
the
appeal
and
feel
like
this
is
a
good
one
to
break
up
any
monotony
with
the
maltpacked
stouts
i
would
definitely
get
a
pint
again
of
this
if
im
having
a
few
that
evening
very
drinkable
d
appearances
were
deceiving
here
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
i
wouldve
thought
didnt
get
much
whiskey
flavor
too
bitter
for
me
cant
say
ill
be
picking
up
another
of
these
poured
a
very
dark
color
not
quite
as
dark
as
the
engine
oil
reference
in
the
name
but
damn
close
light
brown
head
but
very
small
laced
nicely
on
the
glass
smelled
of
oats
and
coffee
tasted
just
like
the
smell
with
a
creamy
stout
flavor
and
held
through
the
aftertaste
very
nicely
the
aftertaste
is
by
far
the
best
part
of
this
beer
i
enjoyed
the
aftertaste
holds
on
to
your
tongue
i
will
drink
it
again
but
its
not
an
everyday
beer
the
drinkability
is
also
good
i
could
down
this
a
lot
faster
then
i
had
planned
for
sure

not

what
i
expected
here
thie
was
sold
to
me
as
almost
a
barleywine
by
the
barmaid
ok
so
there
was
a
good
amount
of
aocohol
but
i
love
the
appearance
and
it
had
a
nice
creamy
head
somewhat
lacking
in
aroma
though
i
expected
more
but
then
again
im
not
certain
which
style
this
beer
would
fall
into
quite
drinkable
went
down
smooth
but
i
expected
a
tad
more
body
oh
nad
for
the
record
8
50
is
an
insane
price
for
this
in
massachusetts
drinkability
was
quite
good
for
such
a
heavy
and
densely
flavored
beer
this
went
down
rather
easily
actually
with
more
than
a
bit
of
curiosity
and
after
having
the
scotch
barrel
version
of
this
i
added
a
small
dash
of
highland
park
12
yo
to
the
last
13
of
this
beer
with
pretty
amazing
results
the
smoke
aspect
is
no
longer
quasiimagined
oelergud
d
quite
drinkable
there
was
nothing
i
particularly
disliked
about
the
beer
but
i
was
under
whelmed
by
the
smell
and
taste
creamy
thick
mouthfeel
tasty
d
bloody
brilliant
i
think
i
feel
i
would
only
want
one
though
to
sip
and
savour
on
a
cold
winters
evening
a
real
winner
in
my
book
will
need
to
cellar
some
and
re
review
next
year
this
beer
is
a
real
classic
sipper
extremely
tasty
and
slightly
warming
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
despite
its
robust
heaviness
notes
a
good
beer
all
the
way
around
solid
smell
solid
taste
and
solid
mouthfeel
if
it
was
still
being
brewed
id
take
special
reserve
over
plain
ol
old
engine
oil
every
day
and
twice
on
sunday
that
doesnt
mean
however
that
this
is
anything
less
than
a
special
ale
that
ill
buy
in
multiple
bottle
increments
whenever
i
happen
to
run
across
it
oeo
is
the
beer
equivalent
of
comfort
food
and
is
giving
me
plenty
of
warm
fuzzies
as
i
pause
over
the
final
ounce
if
that
isnt
a
recommendation
then
i
dont
know
what
is
overall
a
nice
warming
beer
the
flavor
dissappates
in
the
end
but
nice
on
a
cool
evening
big
bubbly
off
white
hea
sits
on
a
sludge
like
near
black
beer
the
nose
gives
off
some
strong
espresso
along
with
malt
and
a
nice
chocolate
roundness
the
palate
delivers
a
chocolate
like
bitterness
a
little
leather
burning
wood
it
has
a
decent
moutfeel
and
a
finish
that
lingers
a
pretty
straightforward
beer
not
terrible
complex
overall
a
good
beer
with
an
unusual
name
that
is
slightly
misleading
d
this
is
really
really
excellent
in
terms
of
dark
beers
with
similar
flavors
its
outstripped
by
victorys
storm
king
and
stones
ris
but
that
is
heady
competition
with
which
to
brook
comparison
i
will
gladly
seek
out
other
old
ales
but
im
willing
to
bet
this
benchmark
will
be
hard
to
beat
d
good
it
looks
almost
as
good
as
guinness
does
face
it
guinness
is
pretty
despite
its
other
flaws
smells
incredible
and
tastes
great
this
beer
is
an
easy
one
to
drink
seems
strong
than
6
though
maybe
i
just
havent
eaten
enough
tonight
cheers
aroma
was
sweet
coffee
with
a
roastedburnt
smell
first
taste
on
the
palate
is
a
quick
sweetness
with
the
alcohol
faintly
detected
then
it
gives
way
to
a
nice
bitterness
and
then
gets
complex
to
the
finish
with
flavors
of
chocolate
espresso
and
some
tannins
a
good
froth
heightens
all
the
flavors
mentioned
i
have
been
aging
this
since
march
i
got
my
single
at
gomers
in
kc
for
about
1
99
i
believe
sweet
enough
to
be
quaffable
with
enough

to

sipped
as

afterdinner
brew
cheers
a
great
beer
it
was
an
opaque
black
with
a
thick
sticky
coffeecolored
head
aroma
was
sweet
dark
cherry
a
little
chocolate
wonderful
taste
dark
roasted
coffee
chocolate
tiny
bit
of
yeast
a
very
smooth
beer
not
too
high
in
abv
so
easily
one
to
have
a
few
of
my
wife
who
usually
prefers
wheat
beers
liked
this
a
lot
in
trying
to
elicit
a
nice
head
from
this
ponderous
ale
i
pour
directly
down
the
center
my
reward
is
a
large
bubbled
somewhat
dark
tan
one
finger
layer
which
seems
to
hold
its
own
at
half
its
original
size
for
quite
a
while
true
to
its
name
i
cant
locate
a
speck
of
light
seeping
through
this
monster
should
i
expect
bits
of
crankshaft
this
appears
quite
like
a
very
big
ris
thick
tan
suds
ooze
down
the
glass
as
if
overencumbered
and
yet
they
still
manage
to
leave
some
nice
lacing
odor
is
intense
dark
cherries
molasses
caramel
espresso
chocolate
a
wonder
taste
is
of
rich
toffee
creamed
coffee
sugar
and
roast
bitterness
theres
also
a
slight
acidity
that
goes
with
a
lot
of
old
ales
alcohol
seems
to
be
present
in
its
warming
spicy
capacity
this
is
odd
at
only
six
percent
but
very
welcome
low
carbonation
and
a
huge
body
without
doubt
lead
to
liquid
luxury
this
is
a
new
favorite
and
the
alcohol
content
could
easily
allow
a
few
in
a
sitting
pours
almost
black
with
mahogany
edges
very
little
head
and
slight
lace
despite
a
hard
pour
smells
of
alcoholic
vanilla
oak
toasted
chocolate
malts
powdered
cocoa
flavor
is
not
quite
up
to
the
aroma
very
sweet
and
rounded
all
the
way
through
caramel
and
coffee
malts
predominate
with
lots
of
powdered
cocoa
and
burnt
bread
in
the
finish
mediumlight
mouth
feel
with
good
creaminess
and
gentle
carbonation
im
not
sure
why
old
engine
oil
is
classified
as
an
old
ale
and
not
a
porter
but
its
tasty
nevertheless
nothing
special
in
my
book
but
quite
drinkable
good
mouthfeel
nice
body
on
the
tongue
easy
to
drink
despite
its
richness
lovely
after
dinner
drink
pours
an
almost
black
color
with
slight
dark
ruby
hues
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
that
produces
a
minimal
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
roasty
with
notes
of
dark
malts
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
light
for
my
preferenses
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
overall
a
very
nice
brew
that
is
plenty
interesting
and
flavorful
i
loved
the
whiskey
barrel
aged
bottle
i
traded
for
but
this
was
nice
too
a
nice
english
old
ale
that
isnt
that
old
but
i
could
really
see
this
progessing
well
with
some
oxidation
adding
flavors
to
an
already
flavor
packed
beer
i
think
i
picked
up
a
little
maple
syrup
for
a
minute
i
will
have
to
get
some
to
lay
down
for
a
few
and
see
where
they
go
nice
stuff
try
a
bottle
but
not
too
cold
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
color
that
is
not
quite
as
engine
oil
like
as
its
name
would
indicate
but
is
appealing
nonetheless
the
head
is
large
tan
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
more
like
a
stout
than
an
old
ale
as
it
is
listed
here
on
ba
chocolate
cream
toffee
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
however
is
definitely
more
like
an
old
ale
than
a
stout
chocolate
toffee
and
cream
all
remain
present
but
a
nice
bitterness
cuts
through
them
with
ease
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
smoothness
and
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
old
ale
that
i
will
revisit
someday
it
isnt
as
strong
as
others
i
have
had
nor
is
it
as
unbalanced
as
most
american
interpretations
of
the
style
it
is
certainly
enjoyable
though

not
a
very

about
a

width
very
tight
and
sticky
the
color
of
dark

milk
receeds
to
a
thin

smell
is
potent
i
can
smell
the
chocolate
malt
from
about
an
arms
length
there
is
also
dried
fruit
notes
taste
is
very
complex
chocolate
espresso
and
earthy
floral
notes
finishes
pretty
clean
very
little
aftertaste
engine
oil
is
a
good
description
of
the
mouthfeel
very
full
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
almost
no
carbonation
good
drinkability
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
do
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
very
complex
ale
that
i
found
delicious
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
guess
i
was
thrown
off
by
the
packaging
and
price
and
expected
a
premium
stout
i
need
to
retry
this
later
as
the
proper
old
ale
that
it
is
worth
a
try
only
disappointment
was
the
for
something
called
engine
oil
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
and
watery
still
smooth
and
coating

was

interested

a
chance
meeting
with
a
bottle
of
it
afforded
me
the
oppurtunity
to
do
so
who
wouldnt

curious
with
a
beer
that
people
may
mistake
for
something
that
you
put
in

poured

kind

gave

with

10
a
disappointment
to
me
after
much
anticipation
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
ruby
amber
color
and
formed
a
bubbly
light
tan
head
that
left
some
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
some
sediment
present
an
aroma
of
malt
and
molasses
with
a
touch
of
caramel
a
flavor
of
malt
and
caramel
a
fairly
light
body
for
this
style
a
slightly
astrigent
finish
too
easy
just
to
suck
down
it
certainly
has
the
look
of
old
engine
oil
extremely
dark
almost
black
with
just
a
hint
of
ruby
red
noticeable
when
viewed
against
a
light
not
as
thick
as
i
expected
decent
head
but
rather
short
lived
nice
aroma
of
creamy
mellow
chocolate
and
fruit
taste
is
smooth
very
chocolatey
with
a
nice
roasted
caramel
malt
character
a
bit
of
tart
fruitiness
plum
i
think
rests
just
under
the
chocolate
smooth
and
creamy
beer
overall
a
great
treat
this
does
make
a
great
desert
beer
it
also
makes
one
hell
of
a
breakfast
beer
thats
right
before
there
was
coffeethere
was
ale
i
like
to
drink
this
at
the
same
temp
i
would
drink
a
porter
i
find
by
not
chilling
itthat
it
wakes
this
mellow
beast
up
a
bit
more
it
really
does
look
like
old
engine
oil
not
sludge
just
slightly
used
great
aroma
with
fruits
caramel
and
licorice
these
same
items
vocalize
themselves
in
the
flavor
as
well
fluffy
mouthfeel
with
a
smoothhoppy
finish
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
great
warming
characteristics
going
down
and
breathing
out
my
only
complaint
would
be
the
max
of
23
in
a
sitting
a
special
selection
on
tap
at
redbones
bbq
deep
dark
brown
or
black
color
depending
on
the
light
slight
ruby
hints
along
the
edges
creamy
light
brown
head
laced
down
the
glass
smell
was
a
serious
combination
of
sweet
roasted
fruit
sublte
chocolate
and
carmel
malt
and
toffee
taste
was
truly
unique
roasted
plums
raisins
subtle
chocolate
and
coffee
bitterness
finish
it
up
finish
lingers
but
how
can
it
not
with
everything
going
on
thick
full
feelyet
slippery
i
could
have
only
one
of
these
at
a
time
especially
with
all
the
food
they
give
you
at
redbones
i
thought
it
was
a
stout
as
i
drank
it
later
learned
its
an
old
ale
very
interesting
orginal
and
memorable
beer
great
name
too
note
the
second
pint
i
had
a
month
or
two
later
did
not
exhibit
the
apricot
flavor
that
was
there
the
first
time
but
every
other
flavor
note
remained
odd
possibly
one
of
the
most
distinctive
beers
ive
ever
had
the
color
is
deep
ruby
but
not
black
although
it
almost
appears
that
way
in
the
glass
its
topped
by
a
short
but
creamy
light
tan
head
that
displays
good
head
retention
and
leaves
some
spotty
lace
the
aroma
is
intense
full
of
toffee
dark
fruit
roasted
malts
and
light
candy
the
dark
caramel
flavor
doesnt
quite
follow
suit
but
offers
a
very
creamy
round
and
full
mouthfeel
but
not
as
big
as
might
be
indicated
by
the
name
hops
are
present
and
well
integrated
a
very
drinkable
beer
full
of
great
character
but
not
overwhelming
although
im
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
definitely
a
scottishstyle
ale
but
also
something
else
altogether
wow
nice
porter
like
look
to
it
definitely
what
it
says
on
the
label
an
after
dinner
beer
nice
chocolate
and
plums
to
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
roasty
some
chocolate
plums
and
the
slight
apple
peel
taste
that
im
starting
to
decide
is
a
certain
type
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
really
smooth
love
the
name
and
glad
that
it
caught
my
attention
very
smooth
and

light
old
ale
beautiful
garnet
hues

with

undertones
looks
like
i
thought
this
was
lighter
bodied
than
other
bas
yet
it
still
left
long
lasting
residuals
although
its
not
a
huge
beer
many
us
brewers
would
be
proud
to
call
this
their
winter
warmer
thick
and
rich
pour
and
a
toasty
and
sweet
smell
excellent
malt
character
quite
sweet
very
roasted
with
hints
of
plum
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
characteristic
of
this
beer
slighty
carbonated
and
very
thick
this
beer
could
be
as
good
a
topping
on
ice
cream
as
in
a
pint
glass
very
good
beer
boy
the
scotts
really
know
how
to
do
up
the
malt
every
sip
of
this
screams
with
chocolaty
roasty
goodness
big
on
the
body
with
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
yummmy
hopheads
need
not
apply
notes
a
big
dark
beer
to
remember
had
it
on
cask
and
i
am
pleased
that
it
is
easier
to
obtain
now
that
it
is
imported
in
bottles
the
likings
of
an
old
ale
with
a
more
than
sturdy
malt
back
bone
to
hold
up
against
the
heartiest
of
meals
lamb
stew
with
parsnips
and
fennel
paired
with

of
multigrain
beer
bread
would
do
be

sampling
from
a
beerfest
a
few
months
back
was
creamier
in
mouth
feel
and
had
a
slight
russian
imperial
whiskyness
to
it
my
most
recent
one
was
weaker
less
flavorful
looks
good
at
first
pour
with
a
decent
head
but
evaporates
quickly
mouthfeel
was
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
porter
just
average
and
i
was
expecting
much
better
cost
about
34
pesos
or
3
canadian
dollars
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
while
pairing
it
with
a
toronto
winter
cheers
mother
fers
brought
to
me
via
the
six
pack
poured
a
dark
reddish
brownnearly
black
color
with
a
good
brown
head
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
coffee
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
and
rich
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
honey
just
doesnt
seem
to
come
through
in
the
honey
brews
i
have
tried
it
has
more
of
a
smokey
taste
than
i
like
a
decent
beer
hard
to
categorize
for
your
american
friends
too
dark
for
girls
and
bmc
guys
too
thin
for
your
hopheadimperial
everything
crowd
a
neat
niche
but
nothing
spectacular
this
has
the
color
of
a
porter
pouring
out
as
a
dark
rich
brownish
color
the
head
is
a
light
brown
color
and
fizzles
away
to
just
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
deep
and
roasted
with
a
really
interesting
sweetness
in
there
from
the
honey
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
slighty
burnt
or
roasted
in
the
beginning
and
settles
down
in
the
aftertaste
as
a
sweet
and
elegant
mix
of
the
roasted
malts
and
the
honey
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
dark
brew
d
the
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
is
certainly
not
great
i
think
its
worth
giving
it
a
shot
pretty
pedestrian
even
for
sam
adams
d
leaves
a
good
layercoat
in
your
mouth
and
in
a
sense
keeps
your
mouth
ready
for
more
over
two
fingers
of
beige
head
the
porter
is
ruby
and
brown
hues
the
head
is
fluffy
like
a
marshmallow
with
wonderfully
fluffy
retention
and
plenty
of
lacing
adorning
the
glass
aromas
are
acidic
at
first
whiff
with
sweet
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
malts
coming
in
to
balance
it
all
out
flavors
emphasize
the
heavily
roasted
malt
biscuit
malt
expected
from
an
english
style
porter
complete
with
the
acidic
coffee
characteristics
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
and
the
honey
is
undeniably
present
theres
high
carbonation
at
first
but
it
seems
to
mellow
out
with
a
bit
of
time
and
warmth
or
maybe
i
twirled
the
glass
one
too
many
times
nice
residuals
left
behind
from
a
rather
light
body
this
is
a
pretty
solid
porter
d
not
too
bad
to
drink
and
easy
coats
the
mouth
well
and
there
is
just
enough
to
keep
my
interest
d
this
is
a
decent
porter
but
nothing
exceptional
like
many
sam
adams
beers
the
flavor
is
muted
these
go
down
easy
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
one
day
i
will
try
this
again
until
then
i
will
not
look
at
honeylaced
things
the
same
way
im
avoiding
the
sugary
condiment
aisle
in
the
supermarket
for
about
a
month
d
very
drinkable
none
of
the
characteristics
are
harsh
or
overbearing

another
samuel

tick
found
at
my
local
place
beer
might
be
a
bit
old
since
it
expires
in
december
2010
pours
a
nice
deep
black
amber
with
a
nice
inch
of
head
the
smell
is
mostly
honey
but
it
smells
like
bitter
malty
honey
the
taste
is
something
getting
used
to
at
first
i
was
offput
with
the
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
of
a
porter
with
sweet
malty
honey
but
it
grows
on
you
by
half
glass
it
starts
bitter
porter
sweet
honey
with
a
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
but
moderate
due
to
the
bitterness
of
the
porter
drinkability
is
decent
but
i
didnt
really
enjoy
having
to
get
used
to
honey
in
my
porter
a
smooth
light
beer
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
slight
amber
hue
to
it
the
beer
smells
of
malty
the
flavor
is
what
id
expect
from
a
porter
dark
roasted
malt
character
im
not
picking
up
really
any
honey
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
i
dont
find
this
beer
drinkable
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
and
havent
been
able
to
develop
a
taste
for
it
i
just
dont
find
it
well
balanced
overall
its
a
solid
effort
by
boston
beer
company
but
its
far
from
my
favorite
porter
boston
beer
company
tends
to
play
it
safe
with
their
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
worth
a
try
especially
since
its
pretty
easy
to
get
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
cheers
fairly
clear
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
tan
head
smells
of
bitter
coffee
and
some
honey
malts
with
a
light
hoppy
zing
tastes
is
light
and
flavorful
classic
earthy
porter
taste
with
an
uplifting
honey
and
hop
finish
finishes
pretty
clean
without
a
lot
of
lingering
flavor
some
noticeable
adjuncts
though
light
for
a
porter
pretty
thin
body
with
just
a
little
too
much
lively
carbonation
mediocre
drinkability
just
not
my
first
choice
for
american
porter
too
zippy
and
light
and
superficial
drinkability
this
seemed
to
go
down
quite
nicely
but
that
was
in
part
because
of
trying
to
tease
out
the
aroma
and
flavor
components
as
a
drinking
beer
id
be
happy
to
have
this
one
again
and
will
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
do
so
but
that
said
ill
also
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
this
one
down
or
add
it
to
my
shopping
list
d
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
but
still
a
decent
beer
good
solid
drinkable
porter
lacks
hoppy
or
super
bitter
distinctions
and
that
is
a
good
thing
the
honey
mellows
this
one
great
balance
havent
had
this
in
a
while
glad
i
grabbed
a
bottle
dark
as
porter
should
be
pulls
a
35
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
head
but
one
finger
was
all
i
got
this
head
was
light
brown
and
tight
fluffy
bubbles
it
actually
took
a
while
for
this
small
head
to
convert
to
nice
lacing
around
the
side
of
my
glass
honey
and
chocolate
are
the
first
aromas
to
hit
my
nostrils
sorghum
molasses
raisins
coffee
bean
and
a
hint
of
citrus
linger
in
the
background
scents
oh
yes
i
see
why
it
is
called
honey
porter
as
with
the
smell
honey
and
chocolate
are
in
the
forefront
and
with
every
sip
and
slide
around
my
mouth
comes
another
flavor
caramel
roasted
wheat
coffee
lime
and
hops
it
has
a
billowy
mouthfeel
like
marshmallows
oh
yes
i
will
have
another
should
be
good
with
glazed
donuts
this
is
quite
simply
one
of
the
most
vile
tasting
premium
beers
ive
ever
had
the
displeasure
of
tasting
this
beer
is
a
challenge
to
choke
down
syrupy
sweet
and
almost
undrinkable
i
wish
i
had
something
good
to
say
about
this
beer
but
its
really
that
bad
this
tastes
more
like
soda
than
beer
but
much
thicker
and
less
refreshing
this
beer
has
a
nice
dark
color
to
it
with
nice
brown
head
that
last
a
while
i
smell
a
hint
of
honey
and
malts
the
taste
is
out
of
this
world
not
to
sweet
but
has
just
enough
balance
of
hops
and
honey
to
make
it
really
taste
like
a
good
porter
great
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
i
cant
wait
to
drink
another
one
actually
goes
down
well
would
be
exceptional
with
some
more
roastiness
but
if
you
dont
mind
a
bit
of
honey
its
actually
quaffable
im
thinking
of
mixing
the
last
half
of
this
with
another
beer
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
the
rest
on
its
own
either
again
no
complaints
about
this
solid
session
beer
although
overall
its
not
particularly
complex
or
even
overly
creative
bottom
line
would
recommend
good
dinner
beer
in
other
words
enjoy
it
with
a
meal
d
nice
feel
and
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
recommended
not
in
the
fall
drinkability
is
good
easy
to
enjoy
in
a
session
or
as
a
after
dinner
sipping
beer
this
brew
has
quite
a
lot
to
offer
to
anyones
palate
very
nice
beer
cheers
d
dont
think
this
one
is
for
me
waaay
too
sweet
yes
but
not
for
a
while
its
a
standard
porter
with
a
twist
but
not
a
knockyoursocksoff
experience
a
good
standby
porter
but
not
for
special
occasions
d
i
could
spend
an
afternoon
drinking
these
i
love
honey
and
have
been
known
to
dip
a
spoon
in
the
jar
and
eat
it
straight
its
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
brew
but
its
certainly
worth
trying
and
i
would
buy
it
again
d
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
all
night
long
it
goes
down
easy
so
you
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
them
but
why
would
you
want
to
this
is
one
to
savor
d
it
could
be
drank
in
a
couple
at
a
time
probably
not
going
back
for
it
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
my
only
disappointment
is
the
metallic
taste
that
you
1st
taste
in
the
beer
after
a
few
sips
its
gone
perhaps
it
warms
a
bit
or
it
breathes
a
bit
and
disperses
the
metallic
flavor
not
bad
at
all
sorry
boston
beer
i
am
typically
a
big
fan
of
many
of
your
products
to
me
this
was
a
swing
and
a
miss
d
its
really
solid
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
maybe
my
favorite
sam
adams
product
quite
light
for
a
porter
and
very
refreshing
d
very
easy
to
odrink
not
hot
and
cloyuing
like
some
honey
varieties
d
easy
to
drink
this
1
its
a
winner
time
for
my
3rd
one
another
very
solid
offering
from
sa
drinkability
i
could
put
down
maybe
three
of
these
at
a
time
making
it
somewhat
less
than
sessionable
d
pretty
good
i
wasnt
super
excited
about
it
but
enjoyed
it
enough
i
ate
some
dark
chocolate
with
it
and
thought
that
was
really
nice
nice
to
have
this
one
back
for
paring
chocolates
would
be
easy
so
we
recom
mend
taking
a
risk
and
enjoying
this
one
with
some
mexican
food
we
think
youll
find
the
match
to
be
perfect
especially
with
spicier
dishes
or
mole
sauces
d
good
dark
brew
for
sessioning
this
is
a
great
honey
flavored
brew
very
easy
drinking
at
the
same
time
a
good
brew
to
relax
and
enjoy
this
is
very
much
sessionable
and
case
worthy
this
is
a
very
good
honey
porter
i
would
be
happy
with
a
case
of
this
stuff
easy
drinking
and
there
is
just
enough
honey
it
not
overdone
at
all
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
notes
of
honey
taste
is
like
it
smells
malts
and
honey
some
chocolate
finishes
slightly
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
quality
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
nearing
what
i
would
call
a
full
body
a
nice
lace
now
covers
the
glass
this
might
be
my
favorite
porter
to
date
too
bad
its
so
sweet
as
now
it
must
be
rather
on
its
own
after
dinner
to
be
enjoyable
dr
very
good
goes
down
way
easy
as
a
big
fan
of
sams
beer
i
have
to
say
that
once
again
i
was
impresed
with
this
beer
thier
are
only
a
few
of
sam
adams
i
do
not
care
for
but
thats
just
me
of
course
i
will
say
that
to
me
this
beer
out
does
it
self
in
drinkabitlylike
other
beer
that
i
just
dranki
did
not
fully
apreacte
this
beer
untill
i
started
to
enjoy
them
and
not
just
drink
them
if
you
are
a
sam
adams
fanthen
this
in
my
eyes
should
be
at
the
top
of
your
list
to
try
drinkable
and
almost
complex
but
not
flavorful
enough
to
catch
a
higher
rating
dark
brown
mahogony
with
translucent
garnet
hues
when
put
to
the
light
nice
one
inch
tan
head
with
good
retention
moderate
lacing
looks
good
some
porterlike
roasted
smokey
notes
in
the
smell
some
sugary
sweetness
is
noticable
nothing
overwhelming
this
is
a
sweet
beer
as
is
to
be
expected
with
honey
in
the
name
the
malts
and
honey
provide
the
sweet
backbone
with
the
roasted
dark
chocolate
coffe
flavors
far
in
the
back
ground
very
smooth
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
goes
down
very
nicely
it
would
be
better
if
it
had
more
of
a
hop
bitterness
and
some
more
complex
roasted
smokey
notes
to
balance
the
sweetness
the
sweet
is
in
the
drivers
seat
the
whole
way
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
porters
for
someone
used
to
lighter
beers
i
liked
this
beer
but
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
good
porter
it
wont
be
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
at
lastthis
is
one
great
porter
that
is
quite
balanced
and
blends
so
well
damnmy
glass
is
already
empty
md
lightish
body
but
creamy
nice
medium
carbonation
which
creates
an
excellent
mouthfeel
this
is
an
excellently
balanced
beer
its
excellent
for
cooking
i
use
it
for
bean
dishes
all
the
time
and
very
nice
for
drinking
too
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
d
another
exceptional
beer
from
samuel
adams
keep
staying
true
jim
this
ones
nice
d
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
porter
one
that
could
be
almost
sessioned
im
becoming
more
and
more
of
a
fan
of
sam
adams
every
time
i
try
one
of
their
brews
one
of
my
favorite
brews
i
had
not
had
this
in
a
while
so
many
beers
so
little
time
and
was
happy
all
over
again
at
my
first
sip
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
honey
sweetness
is
very
evident
in
this
big
malty
beer
makes
it
smooth
and
silky
in
your
mouth
very
subtle
underlying
tastes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
i
could
drink
this
all
night
a
nicely
balanced
porter
which
i
could
wish
were
just
a
bit
chewier
and
more
robust
in
presentation
i
do
like
the
honey
presence
which
seems
perfectly
in
balance
with
the
other
flavors
i
will
have
no
problems
finishing
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
purplish
highlights
fluffy
khaki
head
minimal
retention
and
oily
lattice
like
lacing
smell
is
of
smoke
burnt
toast
toffee
taste
is
of
burnt
toast
toffee
light
sweet
honey
notes
somewhat
smokey
definite
hop
presence
slightly
thin
and
oily
for
the
style
decent
beer
doesnt
wow
me
in
any
particular
way
but
enjoyable
for
its
ability
to
be
different
overall
very
descent
for
the
price
and
availability
overall
this
beer
is
okay
i
dont
think
its
something
id
necessarily
recommend
to
my
friends
but
i
wouldnt
steer
them
away
from
it
either
a
drinkable
brew
the
taste
doesnt
jump
at
you
and
its
heavier
than
i
expected
for
whatever
reason
but
its
still
a
good
enjoyable
balanced
selection
for
me
one
of
the
more
favorable
widely
available
selections
from
sam
adams
theres
a
touch
of
astringent
and
the
sweetness
takes
just
a
little
off
an
otherwise
good
drinkability
very
dark
brown
when
held
up
to
light
i
can
see
some
mahogany
but
even
when
held
up
to
light
it
is
very
dark
almost
a
two
finger
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
the
smell
is
has
a
very
strong
roasted
malt
character
and
a
sweetness
from
the
honey
the
taste
is
again

out
to

filtered
dark
brown
nearing
black
forming
a
creamy
light
tan
head
with
yellow
accents
retention
is
good
and
lacing
is
average
carbonation
is
moderate
the
aroma
is
very
english
as
one
could
guess
from
the
ingredients
there
is
that
ruddy
soapy
cardboardy
nose
i
get
from
alot
of
english
ales
and
im
not
particularly
fond
of
as
well
as
honey
when
swirled
and
some
buttery
diacetyl
wormwood
carbonation
is
fine
and
contributes
to
a
smoother
than
anticipated
mouthfeel
with
a
mediumdense
body
the
taste
begins
with
wet
cardboard
diacetyl
followed
by
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
and
roasted
grains
in
the
middle
pours
a
brown
color
that
has
a
bit
of
redness
about
it
as
well
can
just
barely
see
through
this
one
has
a
slightly
tanned
head
that
fades
fairly
quick
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
has
some
honey
sweetness
in
it
as
well
as
some
slight
chocolate
notes
taste
is
a
bit
metallic
but
also
has
some
chocolate
and
coffee
mixed
in
there
as
well
the
yeast
is
noticable
in
this
beer
finishes
crisp
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
barley
mouthfeel
is
medium
on
this
one
and
carbination
is
tingly
overall
drinkability
is
quite
good
overall
a
solid
porter
not
amazing
but
very
good
sam
adams
does
the
job
again
the
honey
taste
might
put
people
off
from
drinking
a
lot
of
this
but
it
is
a
little
heavy
to
do
that
anyway
d
a
very
nice
porter
surprisingly
dry
since
there
is
honey
in
it
but
very
nice
i
had
it
with
hamburger
and
french
fries
at
a
pub
not
mcdonalds
it
was
great
try
it
pour
is
quite
colalike
very
dark
with
some
reddish
areas
where
the
light
passes
thru
thin
offwhite
head
not
much
viscosity
as
a
stout
it
would
be
a
disappointment
but
it
is
a
porter
so
i
suppose
that
maeks
it
fairly
good
for
its
style
not
much
aroma
at
all
to
pick
up
on
only
the
faintest
hint
of
malt
flavor
is
malty
and
dark
not
much
honey
characteristic
in
fact
i
would
never
guess
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
honey
porter
unless
told
so
mouth
is
sort
of
thin
bordering
watery
definitely
not
very
fullbodied
it
drinks
easy
but
its
not
very
flavorful
or
too
impressive
so
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
unless
having
no
other
real
options
nice
light
medium
body
that
completely
refreshes
thats
why
im
much
more
of
a
porter
man
than
a
stout
man
and
a
lager
man
than
an
ale
man
d
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
very
well
brewed
but
nothing
about
the
flavor
of
it
made
me
want
another
one
right

i

i

enjoy
porters

sometimes
the
roast
can
be
overdone
and
thats
why
this
beer
novice
likes
this
beer
its
a
good
platform
beer
pretty
tasty
a
sweeter
beer
if
you
think
about
it
but
seems
to
be
balanced
fairly
well
im
happy
to
see
this
one
again
in
regular
rotation
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
boston
beer
co
in
my
opinion
nothing
crazy
to
hold
up
to
the
better
porters
out
there
but
unique
and
delicious
in
its
own
way
i
do
like
this
now
even
though
i
could
only
manage
23
sips
in
my
younger
days
its
crazy
how
much
tastes
change
in
a
decade
notched
as
best
by
june
2007
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
it
almost
makes
me
want
to
run
out
and
get
the
12
pack
that
contains
it
and
the
other
goodies
scotch
ale
black
lager
in
it
perfect
set
of
offerings
for

winter
time
of

mouthfeeldrinkability
nicely
done
well
carbonated
yet
smooth
enough
after
rolling
around
in
the
mouth
for
a
few
seconds
its
really
nice
for
the
style
and
it
breaks
up
the
aggressive
honey
profile
easy
drinking
and
a
fun
twist
on
a
porter
im
glad
there
are
still
five
left
d
good
again
there
was
not
too
much
honey
it
added
a
nice
sweetness
to
offset
the
bitter
flavors
could
have
a
few
dark
and
thick
with
a
creamy
head
honey
taste
is
welcome
alongside
a
slightly
roasted
malt
and
somewhat
pronounced
alcoholic
character
i
wouldnt
have
minded
that
final
quality
being
a
little
more
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
round
and
syupy
but
almost
too
much
so
residual
syrupy
aftertaste
dominates
the
finish
not
my
favorite
sa
offering
sam
adams
come
sthrough
with
another
very
good
brew
this
one
pours
a
dark
caramel
with
a
good
initia
head
and
some
lacing
throughout
the
smell
is
an
inviting
blend
of
honey
and
malt
im
almost
tempted
to
heat
it
and
see
how
it
tastes
taste
continues
the
honey
and
malt
quality
not
overwhelming
just
right
a
nice
dry
finish
balances
out
the
experience
mouthfeel
as
above
is
initially
sweet
but
with
a
very
dry
quality
on
the
finish
very
good
on
teh
drinkability
scale
looking
forward
to
my
second
pours
dark
brown
with
a
some
ruby
and
golden
hues
when
held
to
light
there
is
a
small
on
finger
cream
colored
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
aroma
is
slightly
roasted
malt
honey
toffee
and
a
hint
of
smoke
taste
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
base
with
a
nice
honey
presence
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
a
pretty
easy
drinker
a
solid
beer
from
bbc
i
expected
a
honey
sweetness
and
got
it
but
some
more
balance
would
have
been
nice
a
coffeeish
porter
was
present
enough
to
give
it
a
decent
taste
when
mixed
with
the
honey
but
not
enough
to
round
it
out
not
a
bad
brew
for
but
the
honey
sweetness
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
personally
this
beer
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
it
was
in
fact
one
of
the
first
beers
i
purchased
when
i
turned
21
truthfully
i
can
probably
thank
jim
koch
for
opening
the
door
to
better
beer
in
my
life
im
not
sure
if
this
recipe
holds
100
true
to
the
original
its
been
so
long
since
id
had
one
that
i
really
cant
remember
but
i
will
say
its
a
solid
offering
and
im
more
than
happy
to
welcome
it
back
da
this
might
be
my
favorite
sammy
theres
not
a
whole
lot
of
balance
here
very
sweet
and
very
full
of
honey
flavor
not
a
preferred
porter
for
me
not
horrible
either
i
just
prefer
more
traditional
darker
porters
this
goes
in
and
goes
down
just
like
a
porter
ought
to
its
january
and
im
looking
for
something
to
stick
to
my
ribs
its
creamy
and
satisfying
without
being
overly
filling
also
the
subtelty
of
the
flavor
leaves
me
wanting
more
rather
than
anticipating
it
just
being
over
nevertheless
im
glad
this
offering
is
back
in
the
rotation
a
solid
porter
and
one
that
i
voted
for
in
the
beer
lovers
choice
sam
adams
promo
at
the
linwood
several
months
ago
eric
overall
pretty
good
but
little
too
sweet
for
my
tooth
without
anything
to
say
wow
the
samuel
adams
honey
porter
pours
dark
brown
with
a
little
red
around
the
edges
and
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
roasty
and
sweet
taste
also
roasty
and
sweet
but
sweeter
than
i
prefer
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
style
drinkability
is
better
than
average
but
i
dont
think
id
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
this
beer
is
worth
a
try

good
roasty

background
with
just

very
well
balanced
with

an
outstanding
offering
from
the
folks
at

good
job
jim
overall
an
ok
porter
that
has
a
nice
sweetdry
thing
going
for
it
the
body
and
mouthfeel
seem
limp
to
me
the
flavors
didnt
stick
around
long
as
they
quickly
diminished
after
they
hit
the
back
of
my
throat
ive
heard
great
things
about
this
ale
when
it
first
came
out
67
years
ago
so
i
believe
the
recipe
must
have
changed
some
cheers
poured
a
dark
semiclear
brown
with
a
rocky
tan
head
that
left
lots
of
sticky
lacing
on
my
pint
aromas
are
roasty
burnt
sugar
definate
honey
scent
and
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
smooth
and
roasty
with
sweet
honey
throughout
just
a
little
bit
of
bitter
and
lightly
spicy
hop
in
there
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
overall
a
very
tasty
porter
with
a
good
twist
the
honey
is
definately
noticeable
and
makes
the
brew
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
once
again
bbc
does
not
dissapoint
sam
adams
brought
this
one
back
from
demand
they
gave
a
choice
between
two
beers
and
this
one
reigned
supreme
im
glad
they
brought
it
back
because
this
is
one
tasty
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
twist
added
to
a
great
porter
highly
recommended
very
nice
sa
selection

with

foamy

leaving
a
considerable
amount
of

on

smell
was
one
of
honey
malt
and
alcohol
taste
reminded
me
of
a
brown
ale
a
little
bitter
with
hints
of
honey
that
come
through
more
toward
the
end
a
nice
smooth
finish
makes
me
consider
having
this
as
a
session
beer
very
enjoyable
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
the
medium
body
was
disappointing
but
helps
its
drinkability
you
should
try
it
without
hesitation
an
old
style
brought
back
by
sam
adams
in
the
mix
packs
pours
dark
brown
almost
like
a
dark
ale
rather
than
a
porter
smells
sweet
with
some
smokiness
taste
really
nice
not
too
much
like
a
porter
but
a
not
too
sweet
scotch
ale
a
hint
of
bitterness
maybe
some
honey
in
there
too
good
mouthfeel
overall
i
really
like
this
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
way
too
sweet
but
it
isnt
really
nice
flavor
should
be
a
regular
instead
of
a
mix
pack

leaving
a

bit
of
lacing
smells
like
malt
sweetness
and
honey
though
aroma
is
slightly
weaker
than
i
would
expect
taste
consists
of
equal
parts
roasted
malt
and
honey
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
creamy
mouthfeel
wow
this
beer
is
fantastic
easily
a
new
favorite
a
tad
thin
but
nice
sheet
laces
throughout
the
quaff
session
colossal
honey
i
was
really
unsure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
it
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
plenty
of
co2
streaming
skyward
gorgeous
offwhite
foamy
head
stayed
in
place
for
several
minutes
very
impressive
the
smell
was
almost
entirely
honey
there
is
some
roasted
malt
in
there
and
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
as
well
but
you
really
have
to
search
for
them
the
honey
is
really
um
present
taste
too
is
loaded
with
honey
there
is
however
quite
a
pronounced
bitterness
on
the
finish
which
i
would
probably
really
enjoy
but
i
feel
it
clashes
with
the
honey
a
bit
interesting
thing
about
this
one
is
how
there
is
some
malt
present
up
front
then
some
honey
then
the
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
then
several
seconds
after
you
have
finished
with
a
sip
there
is
certainly
a
lingering
honey
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
really
average
for
the
style
not
spectacular
but
you
could
do
worse
too
not
sure
if
i
could
session
this
one
or
not
more
than
two
might
be
a
stretch
it
certainly
is
very
surprising
and
quite
pleasant
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
just
one
though
all
in
all
ill
buy
this
whenever
i
see
it
recommended
easily
the
best
porter
in
america
lives
up
to
its
bold
name
too
12oz
bottle
with
a
freshness
date
of

poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
forming
a
nice
1
inch
thick
head
leaving
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
a
little
honey
the
taste
is
sweet
honey
up
front
followed
by
the
roasted
flavor
expected
from
a
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
im
not
sure
i
could
session
this
porter
but
one
during
a
session
wouldnt
be
bad
ive
never
had
a
honey
porter
before
this
one
and
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
it
has
an
interesting
flavor
but
its
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
with
that
said
this
is
still
an
offering
from
sam
adams
worth
a
try
d
very
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
several
of
all
the
time
as
this
is
defenitely
a
sipping
slow
down
and
appreciate
it
kind
of
brew
not
just
the
taste
but
i
even
found
myself
stopping
to
smell
the
beer
a
couple
of
times
as
i
was
consuming
it
because
of
its
awesome
nose
i
used
to
not
drink
samuel
adams
and
i
heard
this
used
to
be
one
of
their
beers
they
brought
back
i
am
damn
glad
they
did
a
wonderful
porter
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
crazy
crazy
head
and
insane
retention
on
my
glass
its
a
thing
of
beauty
the
smell
is
very
present
with
chocolate
malts
and
some
honey
the
tase
is
smooth
of
cours
with
some
chocolate
malts
and
some
honey
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
could
cling
a
litle
better
to
the
mouth
and
be
a
little
more
crisp
but
nevertheless
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
the
active
carbonation
lends
to
the
bite
and
sweetness
of
the
honey
not
the
smoothest
porter
i
have
ever
had
but
still
pretty
tasty
deep
rich
mahogany
color
nice
tight

good

flavor
upfront
flavor
fades
to
a

i
get

to
it
not
a
robust
porter
for
sure
ok
body
overall
a
decent
beer
theres
better
out
thereeven
from
sam
adams
page
says
its

but
i
had
thought
it
was
rereleased
due
to
popular
demand
drinkability
i
would
enjoy
another
a
great
revival
over
all
for
boston
beer
co
i
would
say
it
is

try
d
not

but
not
the

i
remember
i
am

my
tastes
have

to
me
i
was
in
good
ol
store
24
when
i
spied
a
single
of
this
i
bought
it
date
unseen
tasted
awesome
well
rounded
and
rich
it
was
like
a
time
capsule
of
what
bbc
used
to
be
like
i
went
back
to
see
if
there
anymore
but
alas
there
were
not
the
last
soldier
over
the
years
it
has
become
more
mellow
and
the
flavors
more
blended
the
smell
is
very
rich
of
honey
roasted
malt
raisins
and
dates
it
used
to
be
more
roasted
than
it
is
and
it
has
become
similiar
to
say
sammy
smiths
oatmeal
stout
with
the
addition
of
honey
very
delishious
and
yummy
sa
honey
porter
was
one
of
those
porters
that
got

porters
it
was

solid
and
very

truly
miss
this
beer
and
thought
it
to
be
one
of
boston
beer
co
s
finest
products
to
be
able
to
sample
this
after
its
death
is
a
grand
thing
i
think
i
need
some
todd
time
for
a
bit
indeed
this
is
another
sam
adams
brew
along
with
the
scotch
ale
that
is
immensely
missed
imho
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
robust
body
coffeelike
bitterness
of
this
porter
along
with
the
subtle
honey
sweetness
my
second
stop
on
a
flavoured
porter
tour
mill
street
has
got
the
nitro
can
thing
down
this
pours
looks
and
feels
like
a
guinness
it
looks
great
smells
like
vanilla
extract
and
has
a
robust
roasted
malt
backbone
the
aroma
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
it
manages
to
complement
the
porter
in
an
odd
way
the
mouthfeel
is
delightful
but
the
overall
experience
is
a
bit
off
unlike
some
others
who
still
liked
it
i
could
personally
drink
a
lot
of
these
at
once
but
im
just
not
that
kind
of
drinker
usually
on
a
side
note
i
wish
that
this
beer
had
some
banana
flavours
at
first
i
thought
that
the
flower
on
the
can
was
a
banana
but
on
second
glance
i
realized
that
i
was
wrong
i
drank
this
porter
wearing
pyjamas
so
i
would
have
loved
to
have
bananas
in
pyjamas
my
dream
was
crushed
upon
drinking
this
brew
i
did
not
take
into
account
my
fantasy
in
my
review
and
rating
of
this
brew
if
youre
just
getting
into
stoutsporters
and
want
to
experience
some
of
the
various
flavours
to
try
i
recommend
the
vanilla
porter
great
introduction
to
the
vanilla
flavour
you
can
get
in
this
beer
type
waited
to
review
this
until
i
had
it
a
second
time
wont
be
having
it
a
third
a
sweet
desert
beer
more
subtle
and
balanced
than
other
vanilla
porters
ive
tried
o
4
25
i
have
had
mill
streets
cobblestone
irish
stout
this
tastes
very
similar
but
with
a
nice
infusion
of
vanilla
this
would
go
really
well
with
desserts
and
maybe
even
with
ice
cream
right
in
it
the
body
is
so
smooth
and
the
beer
goes
down
really
easily
other
than
a
synthetic
smell
on
the
nose
this
beer
hits
on
all
cylinders
i
really
like
it
as
a
approachable
low
abv
beer
i
was
expecting
more
carbonation
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
little
flat
for
me
i
am
comparing
it
to
of
course
one
of
my
favorite
drinks
vanilla
coke
and
so
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
would
not
order
another
one
of
these
but
it
does
the
trick
for
the
time
being
and
i
have
had
alot
worst
it
has
a
nice
head
to
it
and
pours
smoothe
you
can
down
it
pretty
easily
but
it
doesnt
really
have
a
nice
smell
a
little
overwhelming
in
my
opinion
the
ba
score
was
a
little
high
but
i
guess
they
have
their
reasons
taste
follows
nose
closely
however
it
feels
and
tastes
light
and
more
watery
than
i
expected
and
had
hoped
i
found
the
vanilla
heavy
handed
and
the
sweetness
over
the
top
definitely
not
a
beer
i
would
revisit
a
desert
beer
omg
this
is
good
coined
a
great
desert
beer
tastes
ok
like
the
coffee
porter
not
keen
on
the
device
they
put
in
bottom
of
can
made
the
can
basicly
explode
when
opened
lost
half
a
beer
o
decent
dessert
beer
maybe
a
bit
light
to
be
great
on
its
own
but
combines
nicely
with
rich
desserts
overall
hate
to
say
it
but
this
pretty
bad
the
vanilla
tastes
very
artificial
and
the
overall
flavor
is
a
touch
too
sweet
to
really
be
enjoyable
wasnt
able
to
finish
any
more
than
half
the
can
before
i
was
forced
to
water
the
flowers
a
bit
this
is
unfortunate
as
their
cobblestone
stout
is
so
well
done
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
cheers
again
guys
o
excellent
get
your
hands
on
one
very
smooth
and
flavourful
one
of
my
new
favourites
from
this
company
drank
in
kunming
sept
10
2014
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
could
see
finishing
a
meal
with
one
of
these
sweet
pints
very
very
smooth
rich
dark
chocolaty
notes
mildly
sweet
creamy
this
nice
little
porter
paired
well
with
chocolate
the
vanilla
goes
so
well
with
belgium
chocolate
yum
overall
pretty
good
id
buy
this
again
i
think
mill
street
is
pretty
established
on
the
everymans
craft
beer
track
and
this
fits
with
that
mantra
too
sweet
initially
while
also
trying
to
be
sessionable
and
bitter
i
did
enjoy
it
though
the
vanilla
is
especially
pronounced
in
the
aroma
the
beer
itself
has
a
fairly
muted
porter
profile
comparatively
little
roastiness
imo
it
is
all
in
all
quite
one
dimensional
with
the
vanilla
worth
a
try
maybe
just
dont
expect
too
much
one
sip
and
i
was
overwhelmed
with
a
taste
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
not
much
beer
here
extremely
sweet
and
too
thick
i
couldnt
stomach
it
tried
to
take
another
sip
and
had
to
call
it
quits
definitely
has
a
niche
market
but
i
doubt
a
goto
drink
for
any
beer
lover
can
poured
a
nice
light
black
color
porter
with
a
huge
creamy
light
brown
head
with
great
retention
and
some
excellent
lacing
aroma
of
vanilla
is
quite
dominating
with
some
good
notes
of
bitter
roasted
malt
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
loads
of
vanilla
extract
which
ends
up
being
a
bit
too
over
the
top
with
light
dry
roasted
malt
notes
body
is
light
but
has
a
nice
creamy
texture
courtesy
of
the
can
widget
well
brewed
but
vanilla
extract
notes
becomes
over
the
top
at
some
point
clear
chestnut
a
bit
of
a
reddish
hue
topped
by
dense
tan
foam
good
head
retention
spotty
lacing
roasty
aroma
slight
vanilla
chocolate
low
bitterness
more
chocolate
and
vanilla
light
roast
brown
sugar
and
cocoa
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
decent
overall
i
liked
that
the
vanilla
was
more
of
an
accent
than
an
overpowering
characteristic
sampled
on
tap
at
a
calgary
pub
early
on
new
years
eve
it
is
a
tad
unfortunate
that
mill
st
has
succumbed
to
the
flavored
porter
craze
but
ok
lets
keep
an
open
mind
i
do
like
vanilla
this
brew
arrived
in
a
mill
st
pint
glass
a
dark
cola
brown
hue
with
the
creamy
light
tan
head
youd
expect
from
a
nitrotap
a
very
light
orange
halo
creeps
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
is
aggressive
floralsweet
vanilla
extract
along
with
some
roasted
notes
like
dark
coffee
a
little
white
grape
fruitiness
which
is
somewhat
unusual
for
this
style
one
expects
the
fruit
aromas
to
be
darker
palate
featured
some
roasted
barley
and
a
chocolate
brownie
effect
probably
from
the
dark
malts
and
the
vanilla
combined
butterscotch
baking
chips
blonde
roast
coffee
and
a
lot
of
vanilla
extract
to
the
point
where
this
was
the
dominant
flavor
throughout
i
suppose
thats
the
point
but
i
prefer
spice
additions
to
complement
other
flavors
and
stay
under
the
radar
a
lot
more
than
this
one
does
still
its
not
too
bad
has
a
little
of
the
sour
character
that
you
get
in
toptier
english
porters
and
some
subtle
medicinal
notes
perhaps
this
is
how
the
hops
make
their
presence
known
thinnish
body
and
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
but
very
creamy
and
smooth
again
this
could
be
the
dispensing
method
used
here
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
brew
but
all
in
all
my
pretty
low
expectations
were
exceeded
if
they
toned
down
the
vanilla
wed
have
a
solid
porter
on
our
hands
prost
lampertland
final
thoughts
all
in
all
as
advertised
if
you
want
vanilla
and
a
porter
combined
this
is
your
beer
its
well
done
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
break
out
to
having
that
wow
factor
landing
it
somewhere
between
good
and
great
thumbs
up
pours
out
a
very
nice
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
beautiful
creamy
offwhite
head
strong
vanilla
notes
on
the
nose
with
hints
also
of
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
of
a
light
nicely
balanced
and
smooth
porter
vanilla
notes
appear
halfway
through
a
taste
and
fade
slightly
at
the
finish
giving
way
to
lightly
bittering
hop
qualities
mouthfeel
is
light
airy
and
creamy
like
a
whipped
topping
very
drinkable
could
use
a
little
more
malt
to
smooth
out
to
the
hoppier
profile
but
overall
quite
wellexecuted
taste
starts
sweet
vanilla
in
the
middle
and
bitterness
and
vanilla
through
the
close
did
i
mention
the
vanilla
a
bit
overpowering
and
artificialseeming
for
the
vanilla
but
still
okay
mouthfeel
is
nitro
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
pretty
good
brew
a
nice
porter
from
mill
street
lots
of
sweet
flavors
but
not
overly
sweet
vanilla
is
out
front
obviously
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
worth
a
try
from
the
mixed
winter
6
pack
pours
big
and
thick
but
the
mouthfeel
is
underwhelming
the
vanilla
is
actually
not
a
big
detriment
to
the
beer
but
rather
a
part
of
the
flavour
i
wanted
a
richer
beer
and
the
lack
of
a
real
mouthfeel
let
me
down
not
as
good
as
the
cobblestone
stout
but
drinkable
final
grade
3
5
a
serviceable
b
mill
streets
vanilla
porter
is
delicious
at
first
but
becomes
increasingly
less
interesting
as
you
make
your
way
through
the
glass
that
gob
of
vanilla
and
milk
chocolate
that
hits
you
with
the
first
sip
is
really
all
this
beer
has
going
for
it
after
that
it
just
feels
flat
limp
and
uninteresting
a
decent
dessert
beer
that
id
consider
getting
again
but
cobblestone
is
the
superior
product
by
a
comfortable
margin
both
in
terms
of
quality
and
adherence
to
style
as
anyone
looking
for
a
serious
porter
is
likely
to
be
disappointed
with
this
one
not
all
that
complex
but
drinkable
memorable
not
so
much
overall
an
english
porter
that
uses
pure
vanilla
extract
in
a
way
that
it
remains
balanced
with
roasted
malts
without
overpowering
delicious
flavour
that
can
be
sipped
on
all
night
long
that
second
can
may
well
be
served
as
a
dessert
beer
and
i
just
might
take
lcbo
lady
up
on
her
serving
suggestion
and
give
it
the
deep
freeze
first
overall
tastes
like
i
expected
it
to
maybe
a
little
thin
and
watery
but
a
great
scent
not
something
id
want
to
drink
more
than
one
can
of
but
a
decent
example
of
the
style
i
really
love
vanilla
favorite
ice
cream
flavor
and
everything
but
im
afraid
that
the
vanilla
and
caramel
sweetness
are
rather
overpowering
here
and
it
doesnt
quite
come
together
for
me
as
a
porter
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
i
doubt
i
would
buy
it
more
than
once
a
year
mind
you
it
would
be
gorgeous
for
baking
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
not
one
im
overly
impressed
with
expecting
more
vanilla
even
though
that
was
the
focus
of
this
onedimensional
beer
and
definitely
expecting
more
of
a
porter
fullness
than
what
was
provided
vanilla
yes
porter
definitely
not
from
the
marketing
around
this
pub
it
almost
seems
to
me
like
theyre
afraid
of
putting
people
off
with
bigflavoured
brews
i
get
that
but
this
effort
is
just
weak
no
brewer
should
ever
be
afraid
of
making
a
proper
dark
beer
they
can
still
be
sweet
tasty
and
drinkable
anyway
definitely
more
vanilla
than
porter
if
going
strictly
by
the
name
as
the
base
dark
beer
attributes
get
passed
over
to
a
large
degree
there
are
smoke
and
sourish
essences
to
be
fair
but
they
provide
more
of
a
understated
support
role
worth
a
try
but
im
not
certain
that
my
palate
and
sweet
tooth
could
take
another
dose
of
this
clear
dark
brown
beer
with
a
thick
nitro
induced
light
tan
head
a
hint
lighter
than
i
had
expected
decent
nose
dominated
by
vanilla
and
not
much
else
the
body
is
thin
with
no
roast
notes
evident
and
the
only
flavour
in
play
is
vanilla
this
may
have
been
served
a
little
cold
but
even
as
it
warmed
no
real
other
flavours
came
out
onedimensional
to
a
fault
an
enjoyable
pint
and
ill
buy
it
again
but
my
socks
remained
firmly
on
od
a
very
tasty
vanilla
porter
very
nice
with
strong
flavours
and
very
smooth
a
pleasure
m
medium
body
and
creamy
light
carbonation
drinkability
will
give
this
another
chance
if
i
encounter
it
but
if
this
beer
was
right
its
definitely
a
huge
blunder
by
the
usually
reliable
mill
street
vanilla
is
one
of
my
favourite
flavours
for
any
sweet
treat
and
ive
yet
to
find
a
vanilla
something
or
other
that
i
cant
at
least
tolerate
with
a
smile
but
i
dont
love
it
enough
to
overlook
this
beers
lack
of
maltiness
and
other
flavours
gimmicky
or
not
a
porter
requires
more
than
just
some
artificial
flavouring
otherwise
its
not
much
of
a
porter
at
all
had
this
on
nitrotap
at
cest
what
pours
a
really
dark
brown
colour
with
a
finger
of
thick
white
head
smells
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
with
some
mild
roast
almost
like
a
milkshake
very
sweet
almost
no
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
creamy
easy
to
drink
porter
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
row
due
to
the
sweetness
mill
street
is
hitormiss
for
me
this
one
was
a
hit
but
not
something
i
can
drink
too
much
of
even
though
the
vanillachocolate
flavor
was
mercifully
subdued
the
brew
lacked
a
roasted
porter
character
to
combat
the
sweetness
had
there
been
more
porter
characteristics
here
mill
street
vanilla
porter
would
have
been
a
firstrate
brew
as
it
stands
it
is
still
a
good
brew
and
a
tasty
one
to
enjoy
right
before
the
holidays
on
tap
at
chancey
smiths
deep
coffee
like
pour
with
ruby
hues
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
has
a
frothy
mocha
cap
nose
of
intense
vanilla
extract
roasted
coffee
beans
dark
chocolate
too
but
the
vanilla
is
powerful
here
tastes
of
sweet
concentrated
vanilla
some
hoppy
bitter
roastiness
dark
chocolate
a
bit
of
mint
wow
there
is
a
lot
of
vanilla
here
finish
is
creamy
medium
bodied
leaving
a
lengthy
vanilla
finish
quite
good
but
one
pint
is
enough
thank
you
very
much
a
deliciously
drinkable
beer
upfront
but
slowly
it
grows
on
you
and
near
the
end
you
find
it
hard
to
finish
i
think
they
added
too
much
vanilla
here
if
there
was
less
of
that
and
more
of
the
porter
this
would
be
almost
perfect
msvp
does
not
have
the
features
of
a
traditional
porter
smoke
hops
lots
of
roast
mediumfull
body
but
its
still
a
very
tasty
dark
beer
worth
a
try
imo
even
if
doesnt
adhere
to
the
style
it
was
a
pleasant
drink
but
if
you
come
across
it
do
not
expect
anything
like
the
porter
style
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
creamy
and
smooth
i
have
no
idea
who
decided
this
was
a
porter
zero
porter
character
from
the
appearance
down
to
the
taste
vanilla
is
alright
but
seems
a
little
fake
not
too
bad
as
a
beer
but
as
a
porter
this
is
shameful
o
a
very
good
porter
although
the
bitterness
level
seems
perhaps
a
bit
higher
than
most
tasty
notes
of
milk
chocolate
and
black
coffee
along
with
some
smoke
provide
just
about
everything
one
would
expect
in
a
flavorful
porter
o
like
i
said
above
a
very
fine
beer
but
more
like
a
stout
o
chocolaty
even
for
style
2
75
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
simple
and
the
flavors
it
focusses
on
arent
the
right
ones
feeling
some
cocoa
and
caramel
tones
but
the
burnt
malt
wins
out
in
taste
its
followed
by
an
almost
watery
feel
as
for
the
taste
its
a
nice
porter
in
line
with
the
genre
but
the
residual
watery
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
distracting
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
and
nice
drinking
porter
i
feel
like
its
definitely
better
as
its
warmed
up
the
one
thing
i
dislike
about
a
lot
of
the
porters
that
i
try
is
that
the
flavor
profile
drops
off
so
fast
this
is
not
like
that
at
all
super
smooth
and
great
character
even
has
a
little
vanilla
in
there
it
seems
a
great
drinker
could
easily
go
for
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
o
this
is
a
decent
porter
its
a
bit
light
and
thin
for
the
style
but
it
is
still
solid
for
me
the
only
real
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
extremely
dark
brown
with
next
to
no
head
roasty
aroma
with
some
dark
chocolate
liquorice
and
molasses
flavor
started
slightly
sweet
with
some
coffee
more
chocolate
and
long
dry
finish
light
to
medium
body
bbc
is
not
on
my
favorite
brewery
list
from
the
2
brews
i
had
from
them
the
beer
is
drinkable
just
not
very
memorable
overall
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
porter
it
is
good
but
nothing
really
stands
out
o
a
little
disappointed
that
this
one
gushed
all
over
the
place
immediately
after
opening
note
open
all
beers
over
a
sink
just
in
case
otherwise
smell
was
right
on
point
with
a
classic
english
porter
taste
was
a
little
bitter
and
notes
of
wood
char
came
through
a
little
more
than
i
think
a
classic
english
porter
should
but
i
still
liked
it
i
would
not
seek
this
beer
again
but
if
offered
i
would
not
turn
it
down
o
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
nothing
really
stands
out
in
the
taste
as
being
very
interesting
a
huge
let
down
overall
a
really
nice
little
porter
i
was
very
happy
with
a
highly
enjoyable
english
porter
worthy
of
trying
my
bottle
was
several
months
past
best
by
and
held
up
very
well
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
fairly
enjoyable
if
in
a
grocery
store
id
buy
this
if
in
a
proper
beer
store
theres
probably
3
or
4
better
options
when
in
the
mood
for
a
porter
this
beer
was
given
to
me
by
a
friend
who
wanted
to
know
if
i
had
ever
had
it
before
i
hadnt
so
i
gave
it
a
try
dark
star
poured
out
like
any
porter
should
it
had
a
nice
dark
body
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
it
even
with
the
darkness
the
beer
was
almost
see
through
it
could
have
been
a
little
darker
i
think
the
smell
was
nicely
roasted
and
had
just
a
touch
of
hops
coming
through
the
mouthfeel
was
just
a
bit
too
light
for
a
porter
i
think
this
beer
isnt
terrible
but
better
choices
are
out
there
a
bit
too
thin
in
my
opinion
for
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
porter
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
no
wowfactor
other
than
the
initial
smokey
character
a
really
solid
and
representative
example
of
a
sessionable
porter
a
winner
and
one
id
easily
return
to
or
refer
as
a
fine
and
drinkable
beginners
porter
this
was
my
first
beer
from
bbc
a
company
who
i
consider
to
be
a
local
brewery
in
my
ky
territory
and
it
was
a
fine
start
very
enjoyable
and
robust
all
in
its
own
while
its
certainly
not
a
mindblowing
porter
it
doesnt
necessarily
do
anything
wrong
consistent
and
enjoyable
bottle
nearly
burst
open
when
cap
removed
foam
going
everywhere
an
aggressive
brew

ample
rocky
head
nose
of
malt
alcohol
and
anise
tasty
sweet
roasted
malt
alcohol
driven
hop
bite
in
the
back
aftertaste
rather
sweet
for
the
style
heavy
body
and
low
carbonation
perhaps
due
to
the
explosion
when
opening
decently
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
less
than
stellar
my
first
beer
from
the
blue
grass
state
and
im
hoping
it
gets
better
d
fairly
drinkable
for
a
porter
but
its
rather
plain
chocolate
and
cocoa
are
pretty
thin
through
the
whole
flavor
and
mouthfeel
d
not
bad
i
will
revisit
it
periodically
more
because
its
a
local
brewery
than
for
any
other
factor
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
complexity
notes
another
one
from
my
past
that
im
revisiting
this
is
a
good
solid
porter
especially
for
the
price
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
good
offering
from
bbc
for
what
it
is
it
was
a
1
45
for
a
single
so
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
a
sixer
of
these
if
you
want
a
decent
porter
body
is
crisp
and
bubbly
carbonation
level
could
be
tamed
down
a
bit
for
the
style
flavors
of
old
coffee
mild
dark
chocolate
and
a
crisp
hop
bite
on
the
finish
this
is
a
good
porter
no
doubt
thankful
for
the
opportunity
thanks

with

cover
that
fizzes
down
to
a

layer
pretty
quick
lacing
is
decently
spiderwebbed
throughout
the
aroma
is
a
respectable
molasses
chocolate
with
bitter
coffee
at
the
edges
very
nice
if
you
like
molasses
and
i
do
the
flavor
brings
out
much
more
of
the
bitter
coffee
very
nice
with
just
a
suggestion
of
chocolate
and
molasses
over
it
sweet
but
plenty
bitter
to
tickle
the
tongue
this
is
a
little
bit
under
midbodied
but
thin
in
a
way
that
only
makes
it
more
drinkable
somewhat
refreshing
in
fact
it
goes
down
easy
with
plenty
of
taste
perhaps
a
bit
more
aqueous
than
some
would
like
but
i
am
quite
pleased
with
this
for
a
summers
evening
porter
with
a
healthy
flavor
in
keeping
with
the
style
dark
brown
color
that
is
similar
to
the
color
of
black
coffee
there
is
a
mocha
shade
to
the
head
clean
attack
and
flavor
the
presentation
of
the
flavor
is
very
mild
and
you
experience
the
mouthfeel
as
much
as
any
flavor
there
is
a
dose
of
coffee
close
to
the
finish
this
carries
through
the
aftertaste
and
leaves
the
drinker
with
some
coffee
notes
that
are
present
in
the
aftertaste
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
porter
id
find
it
quite
easy
spend
an
evening
drinking
just
this
beer
and
id
be
happy
to
buy
another
and
another
d
again
skewed
by
the
carbs
i
would
really
like
to
give
this
brew
a
shot
at
its
brewery
or
at
least
on
tap
i
think
the
brewer
has
a
great
idea
on
hisher
hand
drinkability
i
could
have
two
or
three
of
these
this
is
a
good
not
excllent
porter
that
is
true
to
the
style
a
pleasant
surprise
dark
ruby
with
a
thin
brown
head
the
nose
is
heavy
a
nutty
malt
with
some
plum
coffee
and
caramel
and
some
esters
in
the
background
that
didnt
appeal
too
much
the
first
taste
is
dominated
by
the
robust
nutty
malt
the
coffee
is
lighter
and
in
the
background
mingling
with
the
plum
and
esters
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
medium
bodied
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
paired
well
with
the
burger
i
had
drinkability
due
to
the
carbonization
of
this
it
is
a
bit
hard
to
take
multiple
sips
one
right
after
the
other
i
also
dont
quite
like
the
burnt
bitterness
of
it
but
if
that
is
what
you
like
then
it
here
perhaps
i
could
warm
up
to
this
style
given
enough
time
ive
had
this
in
a
bottle
as
well
as
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
louisville
ky
the
appearance
is
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
the
smell
is
an
exquisite
blend
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
of
which
made
my
mouth
water
at
first
whiff
it
tastes
very
complex
as
a
porter
should
the
consistency
is
a
bit
thin
in
comparison
with
other
top
notch
porters
the
mouth
feel
is
just
right
with
enough
carbonation
but
not
too
much
the
drinkability
of
this
porter
is
the
best
of
any
porter
ive
tried
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
porter
and
is
definitely
my
favorite
every
day
beer
simply
delicious
damn
good
flavor
as
well
crisp
slightly
bitter
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
so
easily
drinkable
i
have
enjoyed
my
three
beers
from
bbc
never
had
anything
from
them
before
but
the
three
i
had
were
decent
solid
beers
this
was
no
exception
i
would
most
certainly
purchase
this
one
again
d
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
if
its
your
cup
of
tea
but
i
doubt
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
this
is
a
medium
to
fullbodied
beer
a
pretty
smooth
texture
from
the
onset
you
can
feel
the
carbonation
on
the
tongue
the
taste
starts
with
a
slightly
sweet
start
with
a
coffee
middle
followed
by
a
subtle
bitter
finish
to
close
it
out
drinkability
while
there
is
nothing
remarkable
here
it
is
just
a
nice
straightforward
porter
that
is
easy
to
drink
touches
a
number
of
elements
that
make
it
interesting
enough
to
come
back
to
if
i
have
the
chance
d
its
a
decent
porter
overall
and
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
as
well
mediumlight
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
fairly
mild
porter
roasty
character
is
evident
in
both
aroma
and
taste
but
is
restrained
according
to
the
style
guidelines
this
is
pretty
much
right
on
for
a
brown
porter

have
to
try
a

the

i
get
from

taste
melded

the
flavor
is

and
it
does
retain
an
easy
drinking
behavior
but
whether
its

or
the

itself
my

a

sleeman
fine
porter
isnt
bad
at
all
by
macro
standards
i
could
see
myself
potentially
having
a
pint
or
two
of
this
if
it
were
ontap
at
a
bar
without
much
in
the
way
of
craft
options
its
also
the
best
beer
in
this
sampler
pack
by
a
considerable
margin
that
being
said
anyone
who
has
tried
a
quality
craftimported
english
porter
will
probably
quickly
forget
about
this
brew
as
it
isnt
an
especially
great
example
of
the
style
possibly
the
best
beer
carrying
the
sleeman
name
although
ill
need
to
try
the
original
dark
to
confirm
that
i
suppose
not
recommend
o
pleasantly
surprised
given
sleemans
usual
mass
produced
brerw
i
may
be
given
a
sypathy
point
or
two
here
given
the
lacklustre
nature
of
their
usual
lineup
but
thi
has
me
optimistic
about
future
offerings
in
this
series
if
it
does
continue
this
isnt
a
true
porter
nothing
like
any
other
porter
ive
ever
had
too
many
sleeman
offerings
all
taste
the
same
same
profile
with
subtle
differences
in
all
their
darker
beers
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
i
got
a
six
pack
for
christmas
and
i
tried
a
couple
straight
out
of
the
bottle
and
it
tastes
better
that
way
than
in
a
glass
which
isnt
saying
much
i
havent
had
a
sleeman
offering
in
a
long
while
after
my
dalliance
with
them
many
years
ago
now
their
weaknesses
are
all
to
obvious
plain
timid
and
just
lacking
the
weight
of
the
standard
bearers
of
the
style
in
question
talk
to
the
boyz
in
the
winnipeg
hood
for
tips
johnnyboy
o
a
tasty
porter
and
a
surprisingly
tasty
offering
from
the
sleeman
lineup
probably
the
most
flavourful
ive
had
from
the
company
to
date
and
certainly
worth
a
try
likening
this
to
any
halfwaydecent
porter
is
like
considering
steven
segals
movies
to
be
thought
provoking
and
emotionally
stimulating
youd
have
to
be
stupid
to
believe
this
is
a
real
porter
im
all
for
sleeman
drinkers
expanding
their
horizons
and
trying
different
less
pedestrian
styles
but
its
obviously
a
bad
idea
for
the
brewery
itself
to
try
to
do
the
same
not
goo
get
fullers
london
porter
for
sure
the
trite
roasty
temperament
just
does
not
hack
itfar
too
many
other
craftbrewed
porters
on
the
market
today
are
in
a
totally
different
league
theres
nothing
specifically
bad
about
this
beer
but
the
flavors
just
dont
mesh
and
it
leaves
the
beer
like
a
jigsaw
puzzle
thats
missing
a
few
pieces
i
must
congratulate
sleeman
on
this
one
definitely
a
step
in
the
right
direction
dark
brown
with
an
almost
purple
tone
to
the
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
light
head
of
wispy
foam
the
nose
has
a
gently
sweet
malt
presentation
about
it
the
attack
is
very
mild
and
the
flavors
are
gently
malty
with
hints
of
coffee
and
smoke
as
it
approaches
the
finish
the
smoke
flavor
really
takes
over
and
dominates
the
aftertaste
while
it
manages
to
leave
the
finish
pretty
clean
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
set
off
nicely
by
the
smoke
and
coffee
flavors
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
offering
from
sleeman
but
i
also
have
an
affinity
for
porters
come
to
think
of
it
i
might
have
patrol
the
sleeman
section
again
and
see
if
there
are
any
new
offerings
poured
with
a
ginormous
tanfoamy
frothy
head
and
a
slathering
of
lace
colors
a
dark
clear
brown
aroma
is
quite
mild
chocolatey
and
malty
flavors
a
little
more
complex
with
the
above
characteristics
but
also
a
bit
of
fruit
a
bit
of
bitterness
a
bit
of
hop
and
a
hint
sour
on
the
thin
side
not
too
bad
but
it
seems
theyre
a
bit
over
frugal
with
the
malt
bill

porter
no
way
not
with
this
one
pours
a
transparent
dark
amber
with
thin
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
looks
more
like
a
dunkel
or
amber
ale
aroma
is
faint
and
sweet
trying
to
locate
some
hops
or
malts
and
keep
coming
up
short
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
watery
for
a
porter
but
it
is
clean
and
slightly
smooth
flavor
is
decent
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
again
the
taste
doesnt
resemble
a
porter
but
it
is
enjoyable
in
small
doses
not
a
big
fan
of
this
offering
from
an
otherwise
solid
brewer
mid
to
full
body
good
carbonation
i
like
this
style
a
lot
pretty
good
example
would
drink
again
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
is
light
in
body
and
clean
finishing
for
a
porter
which
gives
it
a
unique
character
while
remaining
decently
rich
and
creamy
a
midline
porter
worth
a
try
really
a
very
good
beer
much
more
than
i
expected
overall
not
what
i
would
call
a
good
representation
of
the
style
d
ive
recently
become
a
dark
beer
connoisseur
and
this
was
one
beer
that
i
had
to
try
just
to
add
it
to
my
list
of
beers
that
ive
tasted
before
unfortunately
it
will
probably
remain
there
on
the
list
of
beers
that
i
have
once
tried
for
i
dont
think
that
i
will
be
voluntarily
choosing
or
even
recommending
this
beer
as
i
was
very
displeased
with
its
overall
rating
i
think
i
need
to
go
pick
me
up
a
case
of
sam
adams
cream
stout
to
refresh
my
taste
buds
as
far
as
porter
goes
this
is
ordinary
ok
in
a
pinch
but
not
one
ill
buy
again
this
beer
pours
a
light
brown
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
cream
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
has
more
of
a
roasted
character
than
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
beer
is
more
like
a
dark
mild
than
a
porter
i
could
drink
this
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
milder
dark
beer
not
very
good
ive
had
bad
porters
and
this
one
is
right
on
par
this
porter
poured
out
a
deep
dark
transparent
brownwith
a
moderate
amount
of
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
a
good
amount
of
stickyness
as
it
slowly
dissapates
the
aromas
are
sweetand
smokey
with
hints
of
nuttyness
i
found
the
taste
pretty
average
for
a

for
me
i

after

is
not

at

timenot
a
bad
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
lazy
sunday
afternoon
extremely
watery
for
a
porter
downright
unpleasant
avoid
at
all
costs
its
sort
of
dry
a
bit
bitter
and
you
can
slightly
feel
the
hoppiness
a
very
good
porter
out
there

you
could
easily
drink
several
of
on
a
cold
night
purchased
from
beergeek
biz

pours
a
dark
chocolate
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
11
5
ounce
bottle
there
is
only
the
slightest
tinge
of
roasted
malt
in
the
aroma
i
think
i
can
smell
some
hops
too
just
barely
i
cant
help
but
think
that
i
would
like
a
thicker
mouthfeel
but
this
one
is
at
least
marginally
adequate
there
is
a
slight
roasted
malt
taste
mostly
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
middle
but
really
just
a
little
bit
caramel
flavor
becomes
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
my
biggest
complaint
about
this
beer
is
that
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
what
little
there
flavor
there
is
its
gone
in
a
moment
disappointing
but
not
awful
its
ok
its
drinkable
its
actually
pretty
boring
i
think
my
time
might
be
better
spent
elsewhere
quite
a
good
beerworth
trying
and
probably
the
best
of
all
the
sleemans
variety
d
a
decent
porter
that
is
somewhat
forgettable
but
nice
i
cant
say
anything
bad
about
this
brew
but
there
is
something
about
that
tobaccoladen
taste
that
is
a
bit
too
much
that
said
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
not
much
retention
but
a
decent
lacing
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
nicebut
weak
body
is
on
the
light
side
with
some
carbionation
taste
is
of
coffeeand
dark
chocolate
roastedbut
not
overly
so
this
is
a
good
light
porter
drinkability
above
average
from
the
porters
ive
tried
not
one
i
will
actively
seek
out
but
not
bad
at
all
i
prefer
a
more
robust
creamy
porter
the
feel
is
bitter
on
the
tongue
not
real
thick
but
creamy
enough
its
actually
relatively
smooth
for
a
porter
doesnt
have
the
usual
sandpaper
viscosity
pleasant
not
thick
or
dry
the
drink
overall
is
thin
but
pleasant
its
bitter
first
sweet
second
really
easy
to
drink
d
yeah
nothing
unpleasant
here
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worst
porters
ive
had
there
is
supposed
to
a
dark
dark
color
not
an
amber
color
there
are
a
lot
of
hops
for
its
style
looks
good
in
the
glass
very
dark
brown
just
like
a
porter
should
the
offwhite
head
was
also
appealing
after
all
that
the
taste
was
a
bit
disappointing
though
i
love
porters
and
this
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
expectations
i
liked
it
well
enough
to
finish
the
sixpack
i
received
through
my
beer
club
but
i
dont
believe
id
purchase
it
on
my
own
d
i
could
drink
these
all
night
again
one
of
the
best
part
3
of
my
personal
average
porter
tasting
aka
cleaning
out
the
fridge
d
not
a
bad
porter
it
just
didnt
grab
me
in
terms
of
flavors
it
wasnt
as
complex
as
it
should
be
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
where
to
start
there
a
just
so
many
flaws
with
this
beer
i
brewed
a
kit
porter
from
brewers
besti
think
it
was
my
first
homebrewand
it
was
better
than
this
the
feel
of
sleemans
68
porter
is
mostly
like
that
of
tonic
water
real
thin
body
much
thinner
than
one
would
expect
for
a
porter
in
my
opinion
the
carbonation
levels
are
too
high
as
well
for
the
porter
style
however
since
the
body
of
this
beer
is
sodamnably
light
higher
carbonation
actually
does
it
justice
however
since
porters
are
supposed
to
be
lighter
in
carbonation
and
heavier
of
body
this
is
off
this
is
a
beer
ill
not
be
buying
again
ever
it
completely
sucks
pours
a
very
dark
amber
that
is
clear
not
much
carbonation
head
is
rocky
but
thick
and
light
tan
nice
aroma
of
cocoa
and
fruit
apple
tastes
of
light
chocolate
with
a
sweet
hint
of
malt
however
it
quickly
finishes
to
a
chalky
burnt
grain
taste
hard
to
distinguish
any
hops
whatsoever
halfway
through
the
session
there
was
a
real
alchohol
bite
to
it
fairly
difficult
to
finish
the
bottle
i
lost
interest
with
its
lack
of
overall

with

to
speak

tangy
and
bittersweet
with
roasted
and
dark
malts
bitter
wow
theres
more
hop
bitterness
in
this
than
i
am
accustomed
to
as
per
the
style
sharp
and
some
might
find
it
a
bit
harsh
finish
is
dry
with
some
biscuity
malt
lingering
and
more
of
that
insistant
hop
carbonation
is
moderate
and
body
is
on
the
thin
side
with
the
bitterness
as
prominent
as
it
is
it
lacks
a
bit
in
sessionability
but
i
can
see
knocking
two
of
these
back
with
no
problem
not
bad
overall
although
the
bitterness
is
a
little
bit
overbalanced
and
overshadows
the
rather
pleasant
malt
qualities
still
its
from
an
older
recipe
and
an
older
era
and
i
give
sleeman
credit
for
this
brave
rendition
hope
they
maintain
these
recipes

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
ia
decided
to
pick
this
one
up
at
the
store
after
passing
on
it
a
few
times
the
lack
of
a
label
on
the
front
really
discouraged
me
as
i
poured
it
i
couldnt
help
but
think
it
looks
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
nice
2
inch
beige
head
on
it
though
kinda
a
deep
brown
on
the
beer
itself
personally
i
prefer
porters
darker
smell
is
a
bit
better
hints
of
vanilla
and
roast
malts
taste
is
like
watered
down
porter
really
thin
hints
of
chocolate
and
roast
malts
in
the
taste
but
nothing
too
strong
mouthfeel
is
mediocre
its
like
water
basically
nothing
special
about
it
just
thin
drinkability
is
ok
i
guess
5
5
abv
and
goes
down
easy
but
a
serious
lack
of
flavor
like
other
more
easily
obtainable
porters
for
me
overall
a
very
moderate
porter
that
might
be
useful
to
get
new
beer
fans
into
the
style
but
otherwise
should
probably
be
passed
up
for
the
many
superior
offerings
available
pours
a
nice
dark
ruby
with
a
mochatan
head
that
settles
into
lacing
the
smell
was
of
alcohol
and
lightly
buttered
grains
alcohol
ruled
the
scent
the
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
hints
of
toast
the
alcohol
is
strong
and
overtakes
all
other
flavors
this
one
just
didnt
blend
well
the
alcohol
was
too
noticeable
while
it
is
called
a
porter
it
looks
like
a
porter
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
have
that
porter
taste
that
i
have
come
to
love
theres
enough
in
there
to
be
called
a
porter
but
not
enough
to
be
called
a
good
porter
the
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
flaovrs
are
present
but
do
little
to
improve
the
character
of
the
malt
there
are
low
level
bittering
that
really
dont
balance
the
medium
malt
base
the
flavors
are
quite
separate
and
dont
meld
well
the
caramel
flavor
seems
a
bit
artificial
the
body
is
what
id
expect
from
an
amber
ale
amber
bockish
and
never
shows
creaminess
or
smoothness
its
a
beer
thats
has
value
engineered
the
quality
out
i
dont
think
it
was
intended
to
be
a
good
beer
this
beer
is
a
deep
rust
brown
color
with
an
attractive
and
rocky
lighttan
head
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
grain
theres
a
little
huskiness
that
seems
a
little
offcenter
also
some
chocolate
and
caramel
aromas
rustic
and
a
little
dry
in
front
the
brew
has
a
decent
bitterness
and
a
nice
hop
presence
that
comes
forth
in
the
midtaste
nice
use
of
bittering
hops
somewhat
astringent
in
the
finish
maybe
from
that
husklike
quality
in
the
nose
medium
to
the
lighter
side
of
body
very
easy
to
drink
better
than
i
expected
to
be
honest
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
roasted
scent
that
boasts
of
black
and
chocolate
malts
its
dry
and
earthy
with
a
slightly
sweet
edge
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
yet
earthy
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
sweet
and
toastey
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
porter
its
quite
earthy
with
nice
sweet
maltiness
mouthfeel
a
little
tart
but
some
nice
creamy
notes
are
noticed
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
pretty
easy
going
down
and
very
easy
to
drink
taste
starts
well
but
has
something
artificial
in
the
aftertaste
texture
is
far
too
thin
and
watery
if
it
could
back
up
the
half
decent
taste
this
beer
might
be
something
instead
its
just
another
macro
porter
wannabe
not
bad
but
possibly
one
of
the
most
boring
porters
ive
had
poured
dark
brown
but
a
bit
lighter
than
average
general
roasted
malt
aroma
and
similary
nondescript
roasted
malt
flavor
doesnt
really
go
anywhere
just
bland
like
a
bit
darker
version
of
the
equally
unimpressive
dark
ale
this
is
vaguely
drinkable
in
comparison
with
some
of
the
worst
macro
swill
imaginable
but
it
really
doesnt
shine
when
compared
to
anything
else
this
porter
richly
deserves
the
rating
its
come
to
have
on
this
site
i
shant
be
buying
any
of
these
again
after
tasting
sleemans
abysmal
honey
brown
lager
i
had
no
illusions
that
porter
68
would
be
great
beer
the
68
is
supposedly
a
reference
to
this
beers
page
number
in
an
old
beer
recipe
book
found
in
a
family
members
attic
anyway
i
cant
bring
myself
to
recommend
it
for
any
purpose
cooking
maybe
even
though
it
isnt
horrible
and
gained
some
measure
of
my
respect
by
the
final
ounce
i
will
not
have
this
brew
again
i
am
surprised
that
this
brew
is
so
poorly
crafted
overall
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
will
be
avoiding
this
in
future
drinkability

this
was
a
very
different
ap
but
well
worth
a
look
i
dont
remember
who
sent
this
to
me
as
it
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
but
i
owe
someone
a
big
thanks
this
poured
a
near
black
with
some
ruby
highlights
chunky
head
but
receded
quickly
leaving
crusty
lacing
nose
is
of
indistinqushable
burnt
malt
perhaps
some
bitter
chocolate
scent
if
i
really
think
about
it
being
there
taste
is
awkward
and
pretty
vile
again
very
mild
flavorwise
with
typical
roasted
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
completely
off
very
light
and
watery
doesnt
match
the
taste
at
all
overall
not
a
good
porter
no
redeeming
qualities
with
so
many
better
examples
available

of

down

almost

much
faint
malty
aroma
with
a
queer
burnt
something
in
the
background
couldnt
quite
pick
it
out
i
found
the
body
too
thin
and
the
taste
followed
along
those
lines
roasted
malts
some
chocolate
and
some
smoke
that
i
didnt
particularly
hop

minimal

is

have
it

probably
wouldnt

it

5
oz
thick
brown
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
of
large
bubbles
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
chocolate
aromas
caramel
chocolate
and
smoke
flavors
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
watery
and
thin
mouthfeel
not
much
going
on
with
this
porter
this
is
not
the
best
of
porters
thin
pour
but
dark
in
color
lets
brown
highlights
shine
through
head
rises
fairly
high
almost
an
inch
is
tan
and
laces
pretty
well
aroma
is
mildly
malty
but
with
some
stale
tones
and
almost
a
rancid
popcorn
back
half
of
the
nose
light
body
lower
carbonation
the
taste
is
not
too
bad
aspects
of
cocoa
with
a
bit
of
roasty
tang
thats
pretty
striaghtforward
minimal
hop
expression
mouthfeel
and
solidity
of
flavors
are
just
too
fleeting
the
close
is
pretty
watery
with
some
tobacco
residue
in
the
finishing
qualities
not
much
to
say
a
watereddown
interpretation
of
the
style
a
fine
beer
indeed
tastes
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
a
bit
of
blackstrap
molasses
with
an
understated
bitter
finish
i
also
find
that
a
hidden
nuttiness
emerges
as
it
warms
definitely
more
nuanced
than
sleeman
usually
is
but
i
still
find
it
too
watery
and
sweet
however
as
it
comes
from
sleeman
i
was
impressed
this
is
not
their
average
brew
its
much
better
in
the
bottle
this
beer
appeared
more
of
a
nut
brown
in
color
than
a
dark
porter
brown
but
once
in
the
glass
the
beer
seemed
darker
with
a
whitish
head
the
aroma
was
nice
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
initially
and
woody
and
nutty
as
it
warmed
the
flavor
was
malty
and
tosted
without
any
bitter
or
astringency
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
slightly
on
the
thin
side
this
beer
impressed
me
with
its
balance
and
quality
i
would
order
this
again
a
very
good
beer
but
it
was
average
i
like
something
a
bit
more
robust
this
beer
if
it
was
pale
would
do
well
on
the
american
market
but
i
think
beer
geeks
and
snobs
will
be
turned
off
by
the
lack
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
usually
compaire
most
porter
to
fullers
london
pride
and
this
is
adverage
to
that
beer
pours
a
dark
almost
opaque
brown
with
a
tan
head
and
deep
ruby
highlights
aroma
of
roasted
malts
coffeechocolate
some
toffee
flavour
not
bad
taste
was
decent
this
isnt
bad
for
a
sleeman
product
its
a
beer
that
has
exceeded
my
rather
low
expectations
but
overall
its
pretty
drinkable
although
way
too
sweet
it
does
have
characteristics
of
a
decent
porter
roasted
flavours
chewy
malt
slight
bitterness
to
balance
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
but
drinkability
is
good
im
reviewing
this
beer
cold
i
mean
cold
as
a
bud
served
at
a
biker
bar
cold
as
this
beer
warms
it
gets
worse
this
porter
pours
a
muddy
black
colour
with
a
bit
of
coffee
coloured
foam
that
quickly
disipates
their
is
one
ring
of
lace
at
the
top
of
the
glass
where
the
top
of
the
foam
reached
its
peak
that
is
all
first
smell
is
skunk
not
surprised
the
glass
is
clear
and
this
bottle
came
from
canada
to
africa
but
i
had
the
rest
and
they
were
all
the
same
and
considering
some
of
the
disappointments
ive
had
with
sleeman
before
im
considering
it
safe
to
assume
that
this
would
smell
and
taste
the
same
if
i
bought
it
at
the
lcbo
and
drank
it
straight
away
after
awhile
i
smell
a
bit
of
caramel
barley
and
chocolate
taste
is
skunky
but
it
also
has
a
caramel
and
chocolate
flavour
that
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
bar
too
sweet
but
the
skunkiness
balances
it
out
surprising
eh
skunk
actually
balancing
something
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
almost
oily
like
a
fish
its
pretty
undrinkable
i
find
something
i
wont
partake
of
again
dark
opaque
brown
poured
from
the
traditional
clear
sleemans
bottle
full
head
some
tiny
bubbles
from
continued
carbonation
left
a
hint
of
lace
dark
roasted
malt
aroma
plus
smell
of
brown
sugar
and
some
nuttiness
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
some
coffee
and
cocoa
and
slight
hop
finish
medium
bodied
yet
thin
and
almost
watery
but
still
a
nice
effort
from
sleemans
good
flavors
and
very
drinkable
not
sure
how
it
would
stack
up
against
other
brews
in
this
style
special
thanks
to
my
folks
for
bringing
this
one
from
back
home
sort
of
a
porterlite
easy
to
drink
a
good
session
beer
too
bad
that
this
is
limited
availability
pours
out
fairly
thin
in
body
but
has
an
pleasant
mahogany
appearance
with
amber
highlights
a
small
tan
head
on
the
pour
settles
quickly
to
a
waferthin
cap
scant
traces
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
winner
for
a
sleeman
product
a
fair
amount
of
character
toasted
and
chocolate
malts
some
toffee
with
notes
of
licorice
and
roasted
coffee
although
the
flavour
contains
similar
elements
there
is
no
real
backbone
to
it
until
the
finish
and
the
lingering
aftertaste
starts
out
weak
and
watery
picking
up
momentum
for
an
aftertaste
of
chewy
roasted
malt
hints
of
espresso
and
chocolate
curious
that
it
tastes
better
after
its
already
been
swallowed
no
real
action
in
the
mouth
aside
from
being
fairly
light
and
watery
even
this
porter
suffers
from
the
classic
sleeman
carbonation
issue
a
little
caustic
on
the
palate
by
far
the
best
thing
ive
tasted
from
sleeman
to
date
they
are
heading
in
a
decent
direction
here
but
still
have
a
ways
to
go
to
put
together
a
wellrounded
offering
a
classylooking
6pack
box
with
the
john
sleeman
signature
date
alcohol
content
ingredients
and
even
tasting
notes
printed
on
a
label
which
covers
the
opening
of
the
box
twistoff
red
cap
with
2004
limited
edition
on
it
clear
bottle
keeping
with
sleeman
tradition
it
poured
decently
enough
with
a
very
largebubble
head
but
one
which
formed
a
solid
creamy
covering
over
the
beer
deep
rich
rosewood
and
amber
hues
very
nice
looking
beer
the
lacing
is
cream
coloured
and
could
use
some
viscositythis
beer
does
not
seem
to
leave
much
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
lactosed
malt
with
some
definite
spiciness
and
black
licorice
green
young
grains
wellroasted
coffee
bitter
chocolate
cinnamon
and
some
raisins
or
plums
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
good
aroma
the
taste
delivers
on
the
aroma
full
up
chocolate
raisins
at
the
front
dark
coffee
grains
on
the
middle
and
strong
toasted
flavours
lingering
in
the
finish
extremely
sedimentary
aftertaste
you
can
feel
the
grains
in
this
one
like
barelyfiltered
coffee
some
cream
definite
coffee
mollasses
some
alcohol
and
just
enough
hop
balance
strong
bread
notes
in
the
longfinish
porter
being
the
mark
this
is
hitting
it
carbonation
is
decent
but
a
little
more
bite
would
be
even
better
this
is
a
very
consumeable
porter
delivering
on
all
the
flavours
i
expected
i
must
admit
in
a
sleeman
desert
this
is
an
oasis
of
the
brewery
the
first
sleeman
beer
i
have
bought
in
probably
three
years
or
more
but
this
is
one
i
could
enjoy
quite
regularly
easily
my
favourite
product
by
sleeman
nicely
drinkable
and
interesting
to
savour
while
being
very
accessible
to
the
uninitiated
i
like
the
classy
packaging
and
the
fact
this
is
a
limited
release
this
is
nowhere
as
good
as
trees
spy
porter
but
i
consider
this
to
be
the
best
beer
from
sleeman
and
a
good
pint
pours
opaque
black
with
an
okay
head
the
nose
is
average
but
the
taste
is
quite
nice
burnt
malts
and
a
sweetish
finish
make
this
very
drinkable
not
a
sipper
but
rather
a
session
porter
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
these
guys
by
far
sleemans
best
brew
overall
a
flavorful
mild
porter
with
a
couple
of
sharp
edges
a
good
attempt
at
a
mega
porter
a
sure
step
up
for
sleeman
im
impressed
ill
buy
some
more
i
want
to
see
what
some
age
will
do
for
the
few
sharp
edges
and
the
under
lying
charred
grain
tastes
in
the
new
brew
these
are
all
that
keep
this
from
being
a
smooth
mild
tasty
porter
maybe
that
signature
sleeman
dextrin
taste
will
disappear
as
well
341
ml
clear
bottle
dont
be
fooled
by
the
ba
score
of
84
this
is
literally
a
perfect
porter
the
first
time
i
had
it
it
blew
me
away
the
second
time
i
had
it
i
got
it
on
tap
at
a
bar
and
it
was
even
better
smooth
and
chocolatey
with
a
roasted
coffee
aroma
it
was
nearly
too
beautiful
to
drink
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
flavours
became
even
more
pronounced
this
beer
is
beyond
a
score
of
84
im
not
exactly
a
beer
expert
but
i
know
that
everyone
i
know
who
has
had
this
porter
has
raved
about
it
go
out
and
give
it
a
try
great
job
again
left
hand
weak
watereddown
brew
with
no
backbone
overall
another
win
for
left
hand
in
my
book
it
doesnt
displace
their
milk
stout
as
my
favourite
left
hand
brew
but
as
porters
go
this
is
a
mighty
good
one

whoops
i
just
went
bust
the
color
was
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
with
virtually
no
head
but
the
smelland
taste
more
than
made
up
for
it
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
porter
great
flavors
of
toasted
malt
and
brown
sugar
delicious
best
porter
ive
ever
had
ever
pours
a
bit
light
for
a
porter
has
some
auburn
notes
little
to
no
head
retention
at
all
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
tastes
very
simple
for
a
porter
everything
about
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
thinner
than
what
i
was
hoping
for
good
carbonation
overall
not
bad
but
there
are
definitely
a
lot
of
better
porters
out
there
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
somewhat
disappointing
it
did
not
have
any
particularly
bad
qualities
but
it
did
not
give
me
much
of
a
reason
to
come
back
for
more
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wont
be
actively
searching
for
it
everything
about
the
approach
of
this
beer
is
great
when
it
hits
your
mouth
it
seems
just
okay
would
buy
again
but
only
if
3rd
or
4th
on
the
shelf
solid
beer
to
me
its
more
like
a
thin
stout
tho
very
enjoyable
coffee
malt
sweetness
one
of
my
favorite
porters
decent
as
a
session
but
relatively
thin
in
body
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
with
ruby
highlights
in
color
very
close
to
black
has
a
thin
beige
head
with
some
spotty
lacing
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
black
coffee
and
even
a
wee
bit
of
black
licorice
in
the
mix
a
tasty
porter
that
isnt
over
done
at
all
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
really
liked
this
one
o
a
straightforward
porter
that
leans
more
toward
the
chocolaty
side
but
isnt
very
sweet
this
was
heavy
a
meal
on
its
own
i
love
and
have
had
many
porters
but
this
one
seemed
denser
than
normal
rich
chocolate
and
carmel
notes
i
will
say
the
label
had
me
slightly
confused
the
j
kind
of
looks
like
an
s
and
im
genuinely
uncomfortable
drinking
something
called
black
sack
ami
alone
in
this
o
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
in
a
while
my
favorite
character
is
the
smoothness
of
the
body
bbd
30915
very
dark
amber
pour
but
not
opaque
with
a
dark
ruby
element
below
average
head
lacing
and
retention
very
weak
nose
of
roast
and
chocolate
over
a
mineral
note
nice
medium
body
with
a
touch
of
creamy
texture
below
normal
carbonation
with
minimal
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
outstanding
intense
balanced
and
complex
it
begins
with
bitter
dark
chocolate
that
flows
into
a
blend
of
light
roast
and
coffee
the
middle
is
moderate
hop
bitterness
over
a
light
sweetness
with
nut
and
grain
characteristics
the
finish
is
somewhat
clean
with
a
slightly
astringent
note
nom
nom
nom
o
slightly
above
average
porter
i
would
recommend
to
porter
drinkers
pretty
decent
buzz
for
6
8
the
label
is
awesome
like
the
rest
of
lf
labels
notes
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
quite
drinkable
i
will
certainly
pick
this
one
up
again
cheers
this
isnt
my
favorite
left
hand
beer
but
its
a
pretty
good
porter
nonetheless
has
the
requisite
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
of
a
porter
but
not
as
smoky
as
some
probably
would
go
for
their
milk
stout
if
given
the
choice
between
the
two
recommended
not
my
favourite
porter
but
certainly
one
to
come
back
to
not
as
flavoursome
as
the
6
8
abv
might
suggest
taste
is
pretty
down
the
middle
with
a
good
amount
of
porter
char
and
roasted
chocolate
mouth
is
cooling
and
char
and
very
porter
like
nothing
really
fancy
about
this
just
a
run
of
the
mill
porter
no
big
coffee
no
deep
chocolate
no
vanilla
good
not
great
one
of
the
lightercolored
porters
ive
had
its
quite
nice
overall
suggest
a
blind
taste
test
with
anchor
steam
smutty
nose
and
others
fairly
light
pour
clear
deep
brown
with
minimal
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
aroma
is
chocolatey
and
nutty
with
a
hint
of
roast
deep
caramel
emerges
more
deep
chocolate
and
bitter
roast
with
toffee
notes
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
lots
of
chocolate
o
i
usually
only
rate
one
beer
a
day
and
i
was
tempted
to
dump
this
one
and
sneak
in
one
more
tonight
it
is
really
underwhelming
no
real
flavor
or
smell
to
make
it
worth
continuing
it
has
a
best
by
date
of
71414
next
month
so
it
still
has
some
life
in
theory
i
wont
get
this
one
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
it
is
a
little
boring
o
i
cant
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
it
pales
literally
in
comparison
to
many
other
porters
decent
for
the
price
paid
11
for
the
6
in
a
low
tax
state
might
be
better
with
a
light
meal
and
definitely
one
that
can
be
consumed
in
high
volume
alcohol
is
certainly
present
if
youre
looking
for
a
full
bodied
knockyoursocksoff
dark
flavor
i
wouldnt
recommend
i
would
bring
to
a
party
but
it
didnt
satisfy
my
craving
black
jack
has
a
nice
dark
complexion
right
out
of
the
bottle
smells
of
a
dark
roast
of
coffee
with
hints
of
cocoa
present
taste
is
nutty
and
filled
with
coffee
with
the
chocolate
coming
in
late
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
a
good
porter
remarkably
easy
to
drink
o
i
found
this
porter
to
be
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
consider
this
beer
to
be
sessionable
the
aromas
and
flavors
from
the
chocolate
malts
are
particularly
inviting
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
would
drink
more
of
these
without
hesitation
my
problem
is
that
it
is
just
born
to
be
mild
and
doesnt
really
distinguish
itself
really
good
porter
light
head
and
nutty
aroma
mild
carbonation
and
a
really
smooth
body
dark
roasted
flavor
offset
with
a
soft
sweetness
taste
some
vanilla
finish
is
nice
and
bright
with
a
little
bitter
hoppiness
great
beer
with
balance
in
taste
and
body
left

brewing
black

porter

the
body
is
mediumheavy
the
feel
is
very
smooth
overall
this
beer
is
great
i
would
say
its
pretty
drinkable
although
its
very
filling
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
a
dark
roasty
robust
porter
and
will
definitely
buy
again
certainly
a
contender
for
my
goto
beer
for
the
upcoming
winter
overall
a
solid
porter
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
of
the
espresso
component
but
the
chocolate
through
in
a
nice
porter
overall
a
bit
dry
and
unsubstantial
for
a
porter
almost
comes
across
as
a
roasty
black
lager
with
less
carbonation
style
aside
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
tasty
and
23
can
be
quaffed
in
a
sitting
at
6

this
is
a
very
smooth
and
balanced
o
more
in
the
vein
of
an
english
brown
porter
which
i
was
not
expecting
no
bells
and
whistles
but
its
tasty
and
very
approachable
left
hand
brewing
black
jack
porter
o
a
very
drinkable
porter
would
even
call
it
sessionable
it
has
outstanding

it
is
very
smooth
definately
a
keeper
a
decent

not
outstanding

its
not

overall
a
good

overall
this
is
a
vey
enjoyable
beer
love
the
complexity
of
the
taste
not
bad
but
not
exceptional
looks
a
bit
lacklustre
though
the
aroma
is
nicely
rounded
flavour
is
ok
but
not
amazing
it
lacks
depth
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
a
worthy
effort
but
it
doesnt
match
the
best
porters
ive
tried
increased
fruitiness
in
the
flavouraroma
might
improve
it
there
is
the
possibility
that
it
has
faded
over
time
although
it
doesnt
seem
off
worth
sampling
but
no
need
to
hunt
it
down
left
hand
milk
stout
is
ubiquitous
now
everywhere
you
look
its
on
nitro
tap
and
the
nitro
bottles
bring
the
experience
home
black
jack
porter
doesnt
get
that
kind
of
attention
at
all
its
the
black
sheep
of
the
left
hand
lineup
black
jack
porter
pours
a
redtinged
deep
brown
with
a
couple
fingers
of
head
the
aroma
is
coffee
and
roast
forward
a
little
on
the
burnt
side
and
theres
something
sweet
here
that
doesnt
quire
meld
the
taste
is
actually
rather
similar
to
their
milk
stout
just
take
out
the
lactose
and
push
the
coffee
to
the
forefront
instead
of
the
chocolate
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
nonnitro
milk
stout
but
i
remember
the
normal
variant
having
a
similar
mouthfeel
creamy
and
lightly
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
solid
overall
black
jack
porter
was
a
good
drink
but
ill
take
the
nitro
milk
stout
over
it
every
day
pours
very
dark
with
little
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
caramel
could
sit
and
smell
this
beer
all
night
absolutely
love
it
the
taste
was
as
equally
impressive
caramel
flavor
with
just
minor
bitterness
very
drinkable
and
found
myself
downing
an
entire
6
pack
before
i
knew
it
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
left
hand
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
was
a
little
disappointed
perhaps
i
was
mentally
comparing
this
to
left
hand
milk
stout
one
of
my
favorites
and
it
falls
short
overall
a
decent
beer
o
good
solid
porter
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
o
this
is
a
nice
well
rounded
porter
not
particularly
strong
rich
or
complex
but
easy
drinking
tasty
and
wellcrafted
o
maybe
this
beer
was
designed
to
be
a
session
beer
i
cant
help
but
long
for
creamier
richer
more
complex
beers
like
old
rasputin
or
greenmans
peoples
porter
after
drinking
this
beer
overall
not
crazy
about
this
brew
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
is
decent
overall
for
a
similar
price
go
get
yourself
some
founders
porter
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
it
tastes
better
than
its
name
suggest
which
told
me
it
might
be
a
bit
bitter
being
a
black
jack
it
is
incredibly
smooth
and
rich
o
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
porter
normally
i
think
of
porters
as
thinner
versions
of
stouts
with
less
robust
aromas
and
tastes
not
so
with
this
beer
while
the
appearance
has
me
wishing
for
more
the
aroma
and
taste
is
pretty
damn
good
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
best
around
for
a
porter
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
one
is
not
thin
by
any
means
this
is
an
allaround
very
nice
beer
o
i
have
never
been
impressed
with
a
porter
and
this
once
again
does
not
fulfill
that
task
average
at
best
luckily
this
isnt
real
smokey
in
a
list
of
porters
i
may
choose
this
but
overall
i
would
not
order
this
again

profile
the
1
5yrs
seem
to
have
mellowed
this
out
quite
a
bit
o
a
dissapointing
brew
not
much
going
on
here
overall
a
fairly
easy
drinking
and
balanced
porter
good
for
a
go
o
i
enjoyed
black
jack
porter
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
pint
of
it
but
at
the
same
time
there
are
more
memorable
options
out
there
i
have
sort
of
a
soft
spot
for
left
hand
because
their
milk
stout
is
one
of
my
alltime
favs
but
this
was
a
good
beer
regardless
i
recommend
it
this
is
a
ncie
sessionable
porter
the
roasted
malts
are
great
its
well
balanced
and
smooth
which
makes
for
easy
drinking
ill
buy
this
again
overall
i
am
really
not
impressed
with
this
beer
there
are
many
better
examples
out
there
of
an
english
porter
so
dont
waste
your
time
seeking
this
one
out
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
the
head
was
thin
with
a
creamy
tan
color
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
nice
roasted
notes
without
much
of
any
hop
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
probably
the
best
part
its
was
sort
of
creamy
and
lightly
roasted
the
mouthfeel
was
soft
gently
carbonated
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
in
my
opinion
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
o
very
nice
sipper
im
a
fan
of
this
porter
overall
a
well
crafted
beer
from
left
hand
really
good
flavors
and
a
solid
offering
altogether
pours
black
with
a
half
thumbs
width
mocha
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
the
edges
a
rich
and
roasty
aroma
of
roasted
barley
chocolate
some
coffeeand
a
nice
dose
of
molassess
a
big
rich
flavor
starts
off
with
the
molasses
and
some
light
coffee
then
comes
the
roasted
barley
then
closes
out
with
a
nice
creamy
chocolate
big
flavor
for
the
lower
abv
also
kinda
feels
like
a
stout
thick
and
creamy
overall
as
expected
a
nice
porter
o
really
wasnt
expecting
the
boldness
from
the
toasted
malts
and
smokeyness
here
kind
of
curious
what
everyone
else
thought
so
i
looked
thru
some
reviews
and
im
not
sure
if
this
particular
bottle
was
off
or
what
would
def
try
it
again
and
would
like
it
to
be
on
tap
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
feels
like
a
porter
made
for
the
summer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
have
grabbed
another
if
i
had
the
time
12

with
no
cloying
sweetness
at
all
medium
carbonation

body
with
a
nice
creamy
and
slightly
slick

very
easy
to
drink
with
no

other
that
a
slight
warming
after
the

overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
porter
a
good
amount
of
robustness
with
great
flavor
balance
and
very
enjoyable
really
well
done
o
on
the
whole
a
decent
enough
beer
but
not
particularly
memorable
d
this
one
is
ok
but
not
the
bomb
less
alcohol
would
be
welcome
black
jack
porter
is
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
ever
had
its
more
wowing
than
sierra
nevadas
totally
respectable
and
enjoyable
porter
though
not
as
massive
and
flooring
as
founders
glad
to
realize
this
is
a
yearround
beer
as
i
will
not
want
to
wait
a
year
for
another
release
i
will
be
buying
more
soon
i
like
it
a
lot
good
work
left
hand
its
not
bad
but
i
prefer
my
porters
on
the
sweeter
side
o
an
above
average
porter
recommended
for
any
occasion
due
to
its
drinkability
a
decent
porter
that
does
have
a
bit
of
an
english
feel
in
body
and
flavor
definitely
give
it
a
shot
even
if
just
for
the
bottle
art
alone
i
love
the
labels
left
hand
puts
out
not
one
that
necessarily
warrants
a
fervent
hunt
for
but
certainly
worth
drinking
might
be
good
for
those
who
are
not
accustomedwho
arent
super
big
into
big
dark
beers
aka
an
intro
porter
to
get
a
friend
newly
hooked
o
not
bad
for
the
style
not
overpowering
just
an
enjoyable
porter
overall
a
very
solid
porter
which
i
enjoyed
greatly
and
would
definitely
recommend
trying
if
given
the
chance
classified
as
an
english
porter
which
would
be
my
first
as
far
as
i
know
o
solid
porter
but
didnt
really
care
for
the
mouthfeel
or
the
floral
hops
in
this
combo
black
jack
isnt
bad
beer
its
actually
pretty
decent
beer
but
its
too
light
even
for
englishstyle
porter
more
like
an
english
brown
with
its
crystal
malt
driven
backbone
toffee
caramel
chewiness
a
hint
of
nutty
roast
in
the
background
mild
hopping
with
an
earthy
spice
current
just
beneath
the
maltiness
with
the
exception
of
the
fade
to
black
series
left
hand
beers
seem
to
be
getting
dumbed
down
slowly
over
the
years
just
sayin
o
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
porter
m
just
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
still
creamy
and
mostly
satisfying
with
enough
texture
to
feel
in
a
slightly
dry
presentation
overall
another
solid
entry
from
left
hand
a
good
english
porter
that
has
a
lil
more
in
the
body
mouthfeel
and
abv
than
normal
but
these
are
all
a
plus
and
very
well
done
there
is
a
very
mild
coffee
nose
to
this
offering
some
light
chocolate
comes
through
in
the
flavor
along
with
classic
roasted
bitterness
the
bitterness
comes
on
stronger
on
the
finish
which
is
the
best
part
of
this
offering
big
beer
for
a
porter
felt
more
like
a
stout
to
me
on
all
counts
smells
like
very
strong
coffee
english
dark
malts
and
burnt
sugar
flavor
is
huge
espresso
notes
up
front
mellowed
out
by
a
nice
chocolatey
smoothness
and
some
noticable
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
heavy
very
full
bodied
i
was
in
this
particular
instance
hoping
for
a
more
sessionable
porter
but
not
the
case
here
although
i
did
manage
most
of
my
sixpack
nonetheless
super
thick
almost
sludgy
at
times
again
much
more
like
a
stout
but
im
okay
with
that
overall
i
am
not
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
definitely
pushes
the
envelope
o
enjoyable
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
really
a
well
executed
and
easy
drinking
beer
will
certainly
be
buying
more
of
this
3
5
d
decent
porter
nothing
really
stands
out
but
its
an
easy
drinker
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
but
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
if
available
o
great
porter
will
definitely
drink
again
o
overall
a
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
porter
nothing
too
crazy
but
it
doesnt
really
have
any
offnotes
good
beer
to
have
around
when
its
winter
o
this
is
solid
4
55
for
me
as
stated
im
struggling
to
figure
out
why
this
isnt
rated
higher
on
here
id
consider
it
to
be
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
porters
and
stouts
ive
had
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
id
definitely
pick
it
up
again
overall
decent
and
drinkable
but
kind
of
weak
i
tried
the
black
jack
porter
at
the
bank
in
wheaton
il
the
beer
came
in
a
standard
pint
glass
and
was
opaque
in
color
with
12
finger
thick
tan
head
that
didnt
lace
all
that
well
the
smell
was
a
nice
roast
earthpeat
with
hints
of
sweetness
and
coffee
the
taste
followed
the
scent
and
made
for
a
very
nice
porter
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
porter
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
thin
black
look
dark
amber
when
held
to
the
light
with
a
12
finger
tan
head
the
aroma
was
full
of
burnt
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
upfront
and
full
of
burnt
malts
there
is
a
thin
finish
of
coffee
and
some
slight
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
this
is
such
a
thin
beer
with
minimal
carbonation
which
is
fine
for
the
style
a
little
more
substance
would
be
nice
all
in
all
nothing
more
than
an
average
porter
overall
very
drinkable
enjoyable
dark
beer
im
overall
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
but
its
not
too
bad
a
porter
i
would
probably
pass
on
trying
this
a
second
time
a
very
candy
porter
but
at
this
time
i
wanted
a
dessert
so
it
was
very
good
o
good
beer
and
i
would
certainly
enjoy
3
or
3
of
them
im
also
not
giving
it
a
fair
chance
to
stand
out
on
its
own
as
that
ive
had
a
gumball
head
and
a
surly
coffee
bender
prior
overall
drinkability
a
decent
english
porter
quite
drinkable
went
well
with
food
welsh
rabbit
and
i
could
see
myself
having
another
simplistic
flavor
profile
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
really
taste
is
lightly
roasted
around
a
light
sweet
caramellic
center
the
beer
has
notes
of
chocolate
tabacco
and
an
earthy
taste
bitterness
is
quite
low
but
seems
to
be
into
balance
with
the
mouthfeel
the
body
of
the
beer
is
quite
thin
sometimes
this
fades
when
the
glass
is
empty
but
the
last
sip
is
also
thin
i
am
not
too
sure
about
this
beer
it
all
lacked
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
good
porter
definitely
worth
a
shot
but
its
just
short
of
being
something
really
special
excellent
brew
i
let
it
warm
a
bit
from
the
cooler
and
with
slightly
aggressive
pour
i
got
a
medium
sized
foamy
tan
head
that
soon
settled
down
to
a
light
cover
color
is
a
clear
deep
smokey
garnet
with
cherry
highlights
and
a
couple
of
nice
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
cocoa
roast
toffee
caramel
hint
of
fruit
flavor
is
like
nose
plus
a
bit
of
salt
some
good
carbonic
tang
and
a
nice
mild
pleasing
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
good
body
and
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
average
length
this
is
a
very
good
traditional
english
style
porter
id
like
more
dark
black
color
thin
head
smells
like
chocolate
dark
chocolate
flavor
is
more
dark
chocolate
cocoa
bakers
chocolate
tootsie
roll
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
the
old
barrelaged
imperial
stout
a
bit
overall
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
sure
id
want
more
than
one
of
these
since
the
chocolate
flavor
was
so
overwhelming
solid
worth
trying
in
the
end
the
damp
squid
wins
out
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
fluffy
creamy
pillow
of
a
head
but
dissipates
to
a
wisp
with
a
cream
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
edge
the
beer
is
rich
coffee
color
held
up
to
the
light
the
coffee
brown
shows
through
pretty
decent
sticky
lacing
slightly
alcoholic
smell
to
this
with
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
this
beer
tastes
of
bitter
chocolate
and
deep
roasted
malts
it
doesnt
have
that
burnt
charcoal
profile
and
thats
a
good
thing
in
my
eyes
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watered
down
this
is
a
nice
porter
pretty
drinkable
but
i
gotta
admit
its
a
bit
strong
for
my
liking
at
6
4
the
alcohol
really
comes
through
but
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
effort
from
left
hand
but
there
are
better
porters
out
there
notes
definitely
an
english
porter
with
a
good
amount
of
dark
fruit
and
toffeecaramel
some
roasted
malt
and
coffeecocoa
as
well
not
a
bad
porter
but
not
my
favorite
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
english
porter
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
but
i
am
starting
to
like
the
lightness
and
complexity
of
this
style
as
apposed
to
some
of
the
more
robust
american
porters
that
border
on
being
a
stout
this
beer
was
pretty
damn
drinkable
it
went
down
pretty
fast
and
if
i
had
another
one
i
would
drink
it
i
could
see
drinking
3
or
4
of
these
on
a
cool
fall
night
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
it
wasnt
overly
robust
and
it
turned
out
to
be
pretty
complex
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
needed
to
be
bumped
up
a
couple
notches
and
it
wouldnt
hurt
to
make
it
a
little
thicker
for
a
medium
body
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
again
when
looking
for
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
english
porter
i
would
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
balance
and
complexity
to
do
this
style
justice
i
still
think
arcadias
london
porter
is
my
favorite
english
porter
but
this
beer
comes
pretty
close
to
it
although
still
being
pretty
different
but
i
have
yet
to
have
a
traditional
english
porter
from
england
so
i
really
cant
tell
which
one
is
more
tradition
but
i
am
willing
to
bet
that
black
jack
is
closer
to
a
traditional
english
porter
i
am
glad
that
left
hand
is
now
available
in
michigan
so
far
i
have
only
tried
their
darker
beers
so
i
am
interested
to
see
what
they
can
do
with
some
of
the
lighter
styles
guess
i
am
going
to
have
to
track
some
down
next
time
i
am
at
the
store
drink
this
was
pretty
good
a
little
bit
of
roast
and
some
chocolate
and
some
coffee
was
nice
to
see
a
medium
body
right
in
line
with
what
i
was
hoping
for
id
have
this
one
again
overall
a
pretty
good
porter
wish
it
were
a
bit
toastierroastier
o
good
porter
overall
although
not
my
favorite
porter
certainly
something
i
would
revisit
another
solid
offering
from
left
hand
o
a
middle
of
the
road
porter
for
me
im
glad
they
included
it
in
their
mixed
pack
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
on
its
own
merits
o
an
ok
brew
flavor
doesnt
seem
full
but
what
is
there
is
good
overall
this
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
english
style
porter
perhaps
just
a
tad
sweeter
than
i
like
but
that
is
no
real
detraction
while
i
feel
it
could
use
a
touch
more
complexity
i
would
gladly
drink
this
porter
when
offered
and
if
i
can
find
it
as
fresh
as
i
got
this
six
pack
i
will
gladly
buy
it
again
as
well
overall
a
good
beer
i
might
look
around
some
more
before
picking
this
one
up
again
but
i
like
alot
of
variety
to
begin
with
overall
this
is
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
by
left
hand
as
with
most
of
their
other
yearround
beers
this
is
a
very
accessible
affordable
and
tasty
choice
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
its
moreso
a
dessert
porter
sweet
and
fruity
yet
has
the
roasted
malt
backbone
different
then
a
standard
porter
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
o
this
wasnt
too
bad
i
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
again
but
it
was
respectable
m
very
creamy
and
full
thick
bodied
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
fullbodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
mild
carbonation
nearly
perfect
porter
good
to
the
last
drop
which
is
really
nice
unlike
a
more
bitter
beer
no
less
fun
finishing
this
one
when
it
gets
warmer
ive
had
this
one
twice
now
and
its
impressed
me
both
times
a
solid
porter
distinguished
by
its
very
nice
creaminess
and
licorice
notes
pours
a
very
dark
brown
edging
toward
black
with
a
nice
creamy
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
nice
licorice
and
cream
notes
in
the
nose
fairly
soft
the
taste
has
more
of
an
edge
but
more
of
that
licorice
along
with
a
roasty
note
and
some
bitter
citrus
peel
tasting
hops
full
but
creamy
in
the
mouth
very
solid
and
with
a
delicious
creamy
finish
imo
better
than
most
have
rated
it
overall
a
proper
porter
o
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
have
liked
is
very
average
for
its
style
but
that
being
said
it
was
a
good
attempt
and
worth
at
least
a
try
not
much
going
on
here
the
first
impression
that
one
has
to
face
is
that
the
brew
is
slightly
spicy
but
soon
takes
over
the
chocolate
definitely
possible
it
also
collects
the
mocha
in
the
mouth
mild
coffee
as
if
it
were
sweetened
milk
but
without
being
sweet
and
bitterness
while
retaining
its
characteristic
especially
in
the
aftertaste
note
that
one
can
detect
a
hint
of
black
cherries
an
exception
to
be
still
because
with
ease
to
drink
quite
impressive
poured
this
english
porter
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
porter
poured
a
dark
brown
color
and
produced
a
foamy
tan
head
below
average
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
full
of
roasted
malt
and
smoke
the
taste
of
this
porter
was
full
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
liquorice
there
is
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
and
it
is
a
little
sweeter
then
a
typical
porter
this
is
a
full
body
beer
not
a
session
beer
dry
finish
very
good
porter
overall
not
terribly
interesting
taste
but
a
good
taste
easy
to
drink
and
worth
drinking
more
of
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
i
dont
know
that
i
will
purchase
again
overall
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
though
it
is
lacking
in
complexity
drinkability
its
a
very
good
porter
with
a
lot
of
flavor
but
never
too
heavy
flavors
come
out
a
little
more
as
it
warms
so
dont
serve
it
too
cold
will
definitely
drink
this
one
again
when
i
want
a
good
porter
o
another
solid
left
hand
product
shouldnt
disappoint
any
fan
of
porters
or
sweet
stouts
overall
a
solid
good
beer
do
nothing
sticks
out
on
this
one
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
just
an
easy
drinking
porter
with
all
the
great
examples
of
the
style
both
american
and
english
i
recommend
reaching
for
something
else
another
local
colorado
brew
i
havent
given
a
chance
to
just
bought
one
in
a
mixed
six
and
i
am
impressed
that
its
one
of
the
better
domestic
porters
overall
its
a
shame
i
can
only
get
this
in
ohio
because
this
makes
me
excited
to
try
there
mild
stout
love
stouts
not
a
bad
porter
and
i
love
how
smoky
it
is
not
really
anything
special
about
this
porter
delivers
a
nice
aroma
still
easy
to
down
i
wish
something
else
stood
out
here
to
keep
it
unique
from
every
other
porter
out
there
overall
thicken
this
beer
up
and
this
beer
will
really
be
tasting
good
average
porter
nothing
fantasic
but
its
just
average
there
is
a
little
more
carbonation
than
i
like
in
a
porter
but
its
still
easy
to
down
not
one
of
my
favorite
english
porters
but
still
decent
d
this
is
a
nice
well
rounded
porter
it
has
a
nice
level
of
malt
complexity
with
notes
of
licorice
and
smoke
though
its
sweetness
and
restrained
roasted
character
prevent
it
from
being
mistaken
for
a
stout
enjoyable
a
decent
porter
but
in
a
style
with
so
many
good
examples
this
one
is
slightly
too
sweet
still
i
always
find
lhs
offerings
to
be
decent
and
this
is
no
exception
the
glass
is
filled
with
a
very
dark
brown
brew
caped
with
almost
no
foam
the
aroma
sweet
malt
thats
somewhat
robust
the
taste
is
sweet
with
hints
of
cocoa
cinnamon
nutmeg
caramel
there
is
a
slight
earthiness
that
i
found
appealing
i
found
the
body
to
be
a
hair
on
the
thin
side
it
is
very
smooth
with
a
good
aftertaste
i
hope
to
eventually
find
more
of
this
o
i
like
it
will
add
this
to
the
porter
rotation
o
decent
i
wish
it
had
slightly
more
hops
for
balance
but
still
enjoyable
o
a
really
great
porter
this
beer
is
complex
and
rich
a
very
well
rounded
flavor
with
a
great
balance
overall
a
bit
of
a
letdown
in
flavor
and
character
much
better
english
porters
are
to
be
had
either
from
england
or
the
u
s
in
my
opinion
this
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
fleeting
head
the
aroma
has
hints
of
chocolate
toast
and
nuts
and
possibly
a
bit
of
vanilla
its
flavor
begins
as
chocolate
that
turns
to
dark
chocolate
followed
by
coffee
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
and
filling
too
filling
for
more
than
one
left
hand
black
jack
porter
is
a
decent
beer
recommended
o
overall
the
beer
was
just
ok
i
had
some
high
expectations
for
left
hand
and
i
was
a
little
let
down
the
flavor
and
smell
were
both
very
underwhelming
but
hints
of
roasted
malts
semi
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
come
through
i
wouldnt
necessarily
recommend
this
beer
to
other
because
i
think
there
are
definitely
better
porters
out
there
o
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
sessionable
porter
this
would
be
it
extremely
well
balanced
brew
i
find
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
medium
body
relatively
light
effervescence
slightly
warming
the
throat
a
really
nice
brew
balanced
throughout
glad
i
got
a
sixpack
instead
of
just
one
muddy
brown
with
reddish
edges
and
off
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
inviting
scent
of
brown
sugar
burning
wood
hops
and
slight
chocolate
tastes
of
chocolate
syrup
slight
cinnamon
brown
sugar
some
hops
in
the
background
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
sweet
porter
with
some
nice
flavorn
notes
but
some
of
them
could
be
annoying
on
the
palate
worth
a
try
but
not
one
of
the
best
porters
around
due
to
its
sugar
characteristics
pours
a
french
roast
dark
color
but
appears
to
not
only
be
syrupy
but
unsettlingly
thick
roasted
stuff
hits
the
nostrils
and
basically
attacks
my
whole
body
nutil
i
take
a
sip
it
tates
rather
blandly
of
a
twodimensional
dark
lager
with
some
artificial
fruit
flavorings
to
the
side
not
much
else
the
roasted
flavor
is
prevalent
but
it
cant
really
save
this
one
theyre
givin
this
out
cheap
now
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
go
before
my
world
is
rocked
by
80s
music
it
pours
a
dark
rubytinged
blackbrown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
light
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
roasted
malts
light
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
a
decidedly
light
twinge
of
pine
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mild
roasted
malts
milder
coffee
cocoa
and
some
light
spruce
bits
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
pretty
standard
nice
unoffensive
porter
straightforward
all
the
way
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
for
a
porter
with
just
enough
fizz
to
keep
it
from
seeming
weak
more
a
session
sort
of
porter
than
a
slow
sipper
and
with
its
reasonable
pricebroad
availabilitythat
works
out
well
for
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
a
little
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
very
sessionable
could
drink
these
all
night
and
not
tire
of
the
flavors
picked
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pours
a
rich
black
color
with
an
inch
of
medium
tan
foam
aromas
of
roasted
malt
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
on
the
palate
this
one
was
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
milk
chocolate
a
little
black
licorice
and
roasted
malt
drinkability
this
is
an
ok
porter
not
the
best
but
nothing
to
scoff
at
either
this
would
be
a
fair
entry
level
porter
for
someone
interested
in
the
style
in
my
opinion
it
is
easily
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
quaffing
it
for
a
night
d
could
drink
throughout
evening
but
i
would
think
they
do
not
consider
this
a
signature
beer
it
leaves
more
to
be
desired
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
being
that
i
love
their
milk
stout
more
so
than
bells
double
cream
and
compare
their
milk
stout
to
duck
rabbit
milk
stout
i
cannot
get
this
is
nc
sop
when
i
got
this
during
a
florida
trip
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
being
great
i
can
see
where
this
could
be
someones
session
beer
who
can
get
it
easily
400th
review
unfortunately
d
a
delicate
carbonation
and
the
bitter
that
balances
sweetness
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
d
i
like
the
feel
of
a
solid
porter
but
this
seems
to
have
a
strange
bitter
finish
that
persists
after
drinking
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
two
in
a
row
still
enjoyable
and
interesting
darker
than
a
black
steers
tuchis
on
a
moonless
prarie
night
no
head
but
to
be
expected
with
a
porter
dont
see
any
carbonation
but
its
pretty
dark
in
there
smell
sweet
coffee
chocolate
toffee
tastes
pretty
good
thick
and
rich
taste
some
chocolate
mealy
comes
to
mind
overall
pretty
tastey
porter
d
not
smokedburnt
roasted
enough
to
be
an
american
pseudostout
but
lacks
any
sweetness
to
balance
the
bitter
chocolate
taste
like
a
good
porter
imagine
drinking
quite
bitter
dark
chocolate
without
the
meltinyourmouth
creaminess
pours
dark
brown
with
a
nice
brown
head
bottled
on
20310
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
coffee
caramel
taste
is
same
as
aroma
palate
is
full
bodied
nice
and
creamy
texture
with
good
carbonation
finish
is
malty
coffee
creamy
with
some
bitter
hops
for
balance
overall
a
very
nice
porter
d
not
something
id
drink
all
night
while
playing
cards
but
this
porter
is
good
nonetheless
12oz
bottle
bottle
on
date
of
02
and
the
rest
is
extremely
smudged
a
common
occurrence
i
have
noticed
with
left
hand
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
with
a
very
small
amount
of
head
some
lacing
aromas
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
the
taste
is
mostly
dark
chocolate
with
some
more
of
the
roasted
malts
sweet
pretty
solid
porter
id
look
for
this
one
again
d
a
very
solid
porter
especially
if
you
like
sweet
porters
with
a
little
bite
nothing
fancy
just
really
nice
beer
i
would
try
this
one
again
and
fresher
for
sure
another
good
brew
by
left
hand
brewing
company
nice
dark
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
smells
fresh
taste
okay
it
is
smooth
but
could
be
a
bit
smoother
a
bit
tarty
mouthful
i
would
say
the
same
think
one
could
drink
this
beer
often
but
i
wouldnt
go
more
than
4
or
it
will
lose
its
luster
25th
t
too
tart
in
fact
kind
of
soapish
and
dull
theres
some
nuttyness
to
it
but
limited
on
all
accounts
not
bad
just
bland
carbonation
hits
full
on
in
the
front
then
a
slight
bitterness
tasting
of
anise
gathers
in
the
back
finnishes
with
molasses
there
are
some
faint
chocolate
notes
more
bitter
than
sweet
though
this
was
an
older
bottle
bottled
in
08
and
finnished
a
little
watery
at
times
a
good
porter
conclusion
anyone
trying
this
beer
must
remember
that
it
isnt
and
american
porter
for
as
such
it
would
fall
short
however
as
an
english
porter
i
feel
it
is
on
a
good
track
and
succeeds
there
is
sufficient
complexity
and
good
overall
balance
it
just
lacks
that
something
that
makes
some
english
porters
so
irresistible
love
coffeechocolate
taste
in
my
beers
get
plenty
of
it
here
without
the
crazy
heaviness
or
motor
oil
mouthfeel
of
an
imperial
stout
passed
on
this
many
times
sorry
i
did
now
wiill
definetly
seek
this
out
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
appearance
is
nothing
special
but
a
deep
rich
tone
and
a
decent
foamy
head
nose
has
an
interesting
combination
of
malt
and
a
subtle
sweetness
flavor
the
same
malty
and
thick
with
just
the
slightest
sweetness
and
a
bitter
peaty
finish
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
quaff
this
is
the
3rd
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
i
like
it
better
every
time
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
sticky
or
heavy
its
not
bad
beer
at
all
but
there
are
many
other
porters
out
there
i
would
prefer
over
this
one
but
at
the
price
its
not
a
bad
deal
certainly
a
rich
beer
i
think
itd
be
hard
to
put
down
more
than
a
couple
of
these
but
its
certainly
ok
im
not
sure
ill
seek
it
out
much
simply
because
the
thick
sweetness
is
a
lot
to
deal
with
d
well
made
but
just
not
my
kind
of
flavour
profile
too
hoppy
for
the
style
not
satisfying
d
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
i
wouldnt
hunt
it
down
if
you
see
it
somewhere
give
it
a
try
enjoyable
well
balanced
porter
2
for
2
on
my
lefthand
tasting
tonight
i
would
buy
this
as
a
porter
purchased
a
single
to
give
black
jack
a
try
served
in
a
british
style
pub
glass
dark
brown
color
lots
of
guinnesslike
surging
carbonation
when
i
finished
pouring
a
large
milky
head
forms
with
some
good
lacing
smell
had
a
nice
chocolate
aroma
to
it
taste
was
great
there
were
notes
of
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
but
there
was
a
sweetness
at
the
finish
that
i
was
not
expecting
there
was
a
sugary
taste
that
i
noticed
on
my
palate
that
i
really
only
find
in
milksweet
stouts
interesting
mouthfeel
was
adequate
but
on
the
thin
side
for
a
porter
drinkability
was
very
good
considering
its
smoothness
and
sweetness
and
also
now
that
i
see
that
the
abv
was
over
6
which
was
not
noticeable
this
would
be
a
good
session
porter
or
a
good
porter
for
a
warm
day
or
evening
due
to
its
light
body
drinkability
solid
but
would
not
seek
out
again
drinkability
decent
drinkability
hides
nearly
all
the
alcohol
content
but
the
quality
of
the
taste
seemed
to
diminish
somewhat
on
the
second
one
yeah
overall
its
a
decent
mild
porter
pleasantly
sweet
but
dark
nice
balance
doesnt
have
a
lot
to
offer
but
whats
there
is
pleasant
smooth
and
drinkable
dark
ale
if
you
are
in
the
uk
then
i
would
seriously
think
of
tracking
it
down
as
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
solid
porter
flavorful
and
balanced
ther
than
some
aspects
of
appearance
very
good
d
if
it
were
not
for
the
bitter
after
taste
this
could
be
a
drinker
d
this
is
a
pretty
nice
porter
i
like
the
fact
that
is
englishstyled
taste
focuses
more
on
the
honeyed
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
roast
and
coffee
flavor
fairly
sweet
and
does
not
show
much
in
the
way
of
hop
bitterness
just
a
bit
of
toasty
malt
on
the
finish
there
is
still
a
bit
of
mild
light
fruit
maybe
some
honeydew
melon
and
strawberries
decently
creamy
mouthfeel
and
is
adequately
carbonated
pretty
easy
drinking
porter
that
is
neither
really
good
nor
bad
falls
in
the
above
average
category
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
every
once
in
a
while
d
there
are
better
porters
out
there
but
this
isnt
that
bad
a
nice
flavor
and
smell
too
it
and
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
bye
strong
rich
aroma
is
of
quality
roast
coffee
with
a
firm
overtone
of
sweet
chocolate
tres
tempting
it
pours
a
semiopaque
cocacola
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
beige
head
flavor
is
like
a
fine
mocha
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
slightly
sweet
with
a
surprising
and
pleasant
bitter
hoppy
undertone
texture
is
tingly
and
smooth
very
pleasant
going
down
the
hatch
drinkability
nothing
bad
about
this
but
nothing
stands
out
either
the
smell
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
poured
this
dark
brown
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
foam
that
frothed
forth
was
a
generous
inch
beer
and
reduced
real
slowly
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
that
of
a
roasted
cooking
chocolate
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
hint
of
malt
towards
the
end
for
the
aftertaste
overall
not
that
bad
of
a
porter
to
have
on
a
chilly
night
all
in
all
a
very
good
drink
imo
easy
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
well
mahogany
accompanies
the
licorice
and
alcohol
not
too
drinkable
poured
this
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
this
beer
looked
like
it
was
going
to
be
great
during
the
pour
but
got
closer
to
pretty
average
the
more
time
went
on
at
first
it
had
a
huge
creamy
head
on
it
that
looked
like
it
was
going
to
have
decent
lacing
to
it
but
it
went
away
fairly
quickly
and
just
left
a
little
bit
of
lace
at
the
top
of
the
class
its
a
hearty
mahogany
color
that
has
lighter
brown
highlights
to
it
only
after
its
been
out
of
the
fridge
for
id
say
atleast
45
minutes
does
the
smell
start
to
get
better
than
average
and
even
work
its
way
to
good
initially
you
cant
pick
up
a
whole
lot
just
sort
of
a
dry
pine
hop
but
as
it
warms
up
you
can
also
pick
up
that
it
smells
well
malted
with
aromas
of
cocoa
and
even
a
feint
hint
of
coffee
once
it
warms
up
it
actually
smells
pretty
well
blended
the
taste
is
a
slight
step
down
has
the
initial
taste
of
the
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
but
it
doesnt
blend
well
with
the
hops
at
all
on
top
of
that
the
coffee
taste
to
it
is
similar
to
coffee
thats
been
on
the
burner
a
little
too
long
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
would
have
to
say
pretty
average
for
this
style
and
thats
probably
being
a
bit
generous
complex
and
finishes
with
i
would
say
an
awkward
bitterness
due
to
all
of
the
flavors
not
meshing
well
together
its
not
very
drinkable
overall
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
only
the
2nd
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
the
first
ive
reviewed
ive
had
the
milk
stout
several
times
and
really
enjoyed
it
im
hoping
maybe
i
just
a
bad
bottle
but
no
indications
on
it
seems
that
it
was
out
of
code
i
may
try
it
again
in
the
future
if
i
have
the
opportunity
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
some
alcohol
comes
through
not
a
good
porter
thanks
russ
drinkability
is
good
good
balance
a
nice
english
porter
an
ok
porter
quite
fruity
and
floral
for
the
style
there
is
some
coffee
there
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
making
this
more
similar
to
an
english
bitter
nothing
really
pops
in
this
beer
but
definitely
drinkable
one
of
my
first
real
porters
i
must
say
this
one
fell
into
my
taste
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
iv
been
drinking
it
since
a
nice
porter
all
the
way
through
the
a
is
very
good
boarderline
5
with
a
nice
foam
that
settles
calmly
onto
the
dark
surface
the
easy
smell
that
this
very
porter
has
i
nice
but
in
not
the
best
iv
smelled
perhaps
my
nose
isnt
train
for
this
very
smell
since
im
new
to
the
porter
scene
the
taste
is
nice
and
has
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
end
the
afterburner
chamber
in
this
badboy
is
very
nice
its
the
strongest
iv
felt
so
far
among
the
world
of
american
porters
can
be
warmly
recommended
got
this
bottle
from
the
cracked
kettle
in
amsterdam
actually
this
one
is
a
good
beer
i
drank
it
in
a
dutch
beer
glass
gives
a
nice
foamy
broken
white
head
beer
is
pretty
darkbrown
all
in
all
i
very
nice
beer
to
drink
even
if
one
is
a
fan
of
the
belgian
beers
appears
a
dark
mahogany
with
ruby
highlights
its
hard
to
call
this
porter
black
especially
when
held
toward
the
light
it
forms
a
creamy
light
khaki
colored
head
that
dwindles
typically
with
non
descript
even
fine
lacing
aromatics
offer
up
a
touch
of
black
licorice
aka
anise
with
a
roasted
malt
character
bringing
out
some
dark
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
accent
notes
herbal
hops
in
the
back
ground
a
bit
of
caramel
complements
the
party
as
well
flavor
brings
out
the
dominant
caramel
presence
with
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
characteristics
including
the
mild
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
again
a
mild
herbal
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
for
some
balance
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
evenly
carbonated
there
is
a
harsh
bitterness
that
is
left
on
the
palate
giving
me
an
aftertaste
that
i
dont
truly
care
for
between
sips
drinkability
overall
is
decent
not
my
favorite
dark
thats
would
have
to
be
their
milk
stout
but
this
will
do
for
now
average
dark
brownporter
style
ale
well
i
am
the
queen
of
hearts
love
that
song
juice
newton
with
my
lip
stuck
out
because
i
am
considerably
disappointed
with
my
buddy
jack
there
is
virtually
nothing
on
the
nose
and
believe
my
i
search
i
wait
and
i
search
again
a
little
hint
of
pepper
and
spice
and
nothing
else
nice
unfortunately
and
thats
it
only
after
drinking
the
final
beer
the
black
flag
imperial
stout
with
its
surge
of
hoppiness
and
returning
did
it
seem
like
a
porter
with
touches
of
maple
syrup
before
that
it
was
just
a
bland
brown
ale
if
i
had
to
summarize
in
one
word
nondescript
would
be
my
linguistic
choice
d
very
nice
beer
a
session
porter
if
there
ever
was
one
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
milk
chocolate
light
roasted
nuts
and
some
vinous
notes
the
taste
is
of
a
light
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
wet
wood
and
a
touch
copper
the
feel
is
light
almost
watery
has
fairly
soft
carbonation
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
a
rather
mild
porter
some
decent
chocolate
flavors
but
nothing
bold
i
like
my
porters
to
be
lighter
than
stouts
but
this
one
bordered
on
being
watery
nothing
off
about
this
brew
but
no
wow
factor
a
sessionable
porter
my
bottle
looks
exactly
the
same
the
only
difference
being
my
abv
on
this
bottle
is
5
8this
beer
pours
a
black
cola
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
head
and
a
ring
of
lacingit
has
aromas
of
dark
coffeedark
plums
and
some
feint
hopsit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
with
a
strong
dark
coffeechocolate
taste
about
it
that
finishes
with
a
subtle
kick
of
hops
and
no
taste
whatsoever
of
its
5
8
abv
so
for
me
its
a
very
drinkable
porter
12
oz
deep

miniscule
hop
aroma
descent

earthyness
warming
does
not
help
this
one
much
a
just
a
bit
too
mild
kind
of
a
sweet
carmelly
finish
some
smokiness
drinkability
is
good
if
you
are
expecting
an
american
porter
you
might
be
dissappointed
but
a
solid
american
version
of
an
english
porter
solid
brew
from
left
hand
but
pretty
forgettable
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
some
fruits
and
breadiness
as
well
the
taste
is
similarnice
and
simple
to
drink
without
too
much
complexity
the
body
is
full
and
is
fairly
drinkable
for
a
porternot
too
dry
this
was
a
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
of
thiers
but
good
none
the
less
appearance
is
deep
brown
with
almost
no
head
or
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
nearly
identical
with
lots
of
deep
roast
and
dark
chocolate
malts
there
is
a
hint
of
earthiness
with
honey
mixed
in
as
well
mouthfeel
is
acceptable
but
on
the
border
of
being
too
light
drinkability
is
decent
as
well
drinkability
the
flavours
just
arent
powerful
enough
which
give
it
an
almost
bland
creamy
taste
which
is
a
shame
there
are
better
much
more
flavoursome
porter
out
there
which
manage
to
achieve
this
with
a
lot
lower
abv
d
very
good
a
good
choice
if
you
want
a
darker
beer
with
a
light
body
overall
slightly
bland
mediocre
middle
of
the
road
at
best
light
bodied
and
watered
down
up
front
with
some
oatmeal
smooth
chocolate
maltiness
toffee
and
slightly
bitter
subtle
hop
presence
in
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
really
is
on
the
bubbly
side
but
not
prickly
or
crisp
pours
with
minimal
head
lacing
stronger
than
any
foam
on
top
not
quite
black
just
very
dark
brown
in
color
turning
to
a
faint
orange
around
the
rims
not
a
lot
of
roast
to
the
nose
more
caramel
butterscotch
vanilla
fudge
and
then
black
raisin
plum
cherry
fruit
has
a
spring
water
freshness
to
it
not
a
lot
of
density
drifts
off
rather
quickly
mediumbodied
while
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
weight
it
still
manages
to
feel
sluggish
and
unwilling
to
move
coffee
notes
perk
it
up
some
but
then
its
basically
the
same
story
as
in
the
nose
chocolate
caramel
butterscotch
and
plum
raisin
other
dark
fruits
the
carbonation
much
more
fluffy
and
active
than
youd
guess
from
the
absence
of
any
head
light
breadiness
with
some
bitters
here
it
tastes
like
fizzy
mineral
water
rather
than
still
stream
water
fairly
lacking
in
complexity
and
finishes
short
another
beer
more
marked
by
absence
of
positive
traits
than
presence
of
negative
traits
overall
probably
better
for
porter
newbs
who
are
put
off
by
dark
colors
the
sweetness
is
probably
easy
to
like
i
honestly
prefer
the
robust
porter
for
their
superior
aroma
and
taste
which
contributes
to
drinkability
this
is
not
a
robust
beer
nice
dark
pour
not
a
lot
of
head
very
little
aroma
just
the
bare
hint
of
coffee
not
much
flavor
either
mostly
cola
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
bland
not
a
lot
of
body
with
nothing
in
the
way
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
as
a
southpaw
myself
i
had
high
hopes
for
left
hand
brewing
but
black
jack
porter
did
not
come
through
as
anything
other
than
average
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
little
deep
red
hue
along
the
edges
it
also
initially
poured
with
a
nice
1
finger
white
head
that
dissolved
way
too
fast
and
left
little
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
pleasant
with
traces
of
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lighter
than
what
i
would
want
but
it
makes
it
easier
to
drink
and
want
another
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
up
front
and
on
the
finish
all
around
you
can
taste
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
d
i
like
how
the
abv
is
not
dangerously
high
but
this
one
did
not
quite
do
it
for
me
so
one
pint
was
enough
i
have
yet
to
be
wowed
by
left
hand
offerings
and
i
hope
to
find
one
more
to
my
liking
in
the
future
d
a
porter
it
is
nothing
special
it
be
i
do
like
the
name
pours
a
deepdark
brown
almost
black
creates
a
tan
head
that
disappears
rapidly
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
maybe
some
dark
chocolate
tastes
almost
sweet
with
the
fairly
decent
sized
roastytoasty
malt
profile
theres
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
present
as
well
as
some
earthy
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
nice
and
warming
a
fairly
decent
porter
i
enjoyed
it
not
sure
id
want
another
straight
after
though
more
of
a
nightcap
for
me
than
a
session
beer
the
chocolate
and
sweetness
makes
it
quite
drinkable
and
accessible
this
is
the
first
beer
that
me
and
my
girlfriend
both
enjoyed
although
i
wish
the
malt
was
a
bit
more
roasted
and
bitter
rich
and
fairly
full
mouthfeel
tasty
beer
very
drinkable
a
solid
porter
d
pretty
smooth
as
much
as
i
liked
the
other
areas
of
the
beer
it
took
more
of
an
effort
to
get
through
it
than
expected
maybe
too
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
with
this
beer
d
overall
im
liking
this
beer
its
not
the
most
balanced
porter
in
the
world
and
i
could
do
with
some
more
hop
flavor
or
maybe
just
some
more
flavor
that
isnt
coffee
but
id
order
it
in
a
pinch
not
a
bad
english
porter
but
nothing
amazing
i
was
sort
of
let
down
overall
with
this
beer
it
has
many
characteristics
similar
to
german
bocks
as
opposed
to
a
porter
the
aroma
is
a
bit
smokey
and
malty
with
some
caramel
but
its
quite
subdued
pour
is
very
colalike
dark
with
a
slight
head
and
reddish
when
light
passes
thru
taste
is
dry
and
malty
a
bit
chocolatemalty
but
a
bit
watery
almost
mouth
is
lighter
than
expected
but
its
not
bad
and
is
one
of
the
strong
points
its
drinkable
in
that
its
not
too
heavy
or
such
but
it
has
flaws
if
this
beer
were
a
blackjack
hand
it
would
be
a
10
and
an
8
its
good
enough
to
win
some
hands
but
not
enough
to
win
against
others
many
bars
make
the
mistake
of
pouring
porters
too
cold
this
one
if
ordered
on
draught
must
be
allowed
to
sit
if
you
wish
to
truly
experience
it
the
way
it
was
meant
to
be
a
complex
beer
that
is
surely
deserves
our
respect
drinkability
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
it
is
a
victim
of
timing
i
have
had
a
lot
of
excellent
porters
lately
and
this
is
not
up
to
the
same
degree
if
this
was
in
a
variety
pack
i
would
have
fun
consuminghowever
i
am
more
likely
to
get
one
of
those
other
porters
as
a
single
first
the
finish
is
the
same
way
there
is
no
bitter
finish
and
there
is
no
hint
of
sweet
everything
counterbalances
so
youre
left
with
nothing
pours
a
ruby
red
with
a
good
sized
creamy
head
coffee
and
toasted
grain
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
a
solvent
edge
flavour
is
quite
toasty
very
fruity
with
some
chalkiness
and
coffee
moderate
bitterness
with
a
soft
body
and
moderate
carbonation
little
bit
sweet
and
tart
fairly
refreshing
and
drinkable
great
drinkability
d
an
average
porter
i
am
a
big
porter
fan
but
this
did
not
strike
my
fancy
that
much
overall
a
nice
high
quality
porter
just
dont
plan
on
drinking
all
of
them
in
1
sitting
overall
very
drinkable
and
great
mouthfeel
not
too
carbonated
but
noticable
very
good
for
the
price
will
buy
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
im
a
brown
ale
fan
and
for
me
this
feels
more
like
a
brown
ale
plus
im
happy
with
the
malty
profile
of
this
beer
could
use
more
hop
flavor
d
a
nice
drinkable
porter
nothing
too
stupendous
but
definitely
above
average
good
sessionability
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
porter
that
is
well
worth
trying
pours
with
a
18
inch
head
that
quickly
disappears
lace
is
minimal
this
brew
is
fairly
similar
to
left
hands
milk
stout
with
a
few
exceptions
first
off
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
in
the
nose
and
taste
along
with
the
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
thats
dominant
in
the
milk
stout
theres
also
a
tiny
bit
more
carbonation
and
a
touch
more
of
hops
that
leaves
a
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
like
the
milk
stout
there
is
some
sweetness
a
good
brew
overall
but
two
is
enough
date
consumed
12
september
2008
the
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
to
black
with
a
huge
frothy
head
decent
retention
and
a
fine
lace
blankets
the
glass
both
are
light
chocolate
in
color
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
hints
of
possibly
syrup
start
is
sweet
the
middle
is
moderate
the
finish
has
some
carbonation
decently
hopped
and
a
fair
to
midline
dry
aftertaste
an
ok
beer
one
that
is
alright
for
a
session
however
better
porters
are
out
there
firm
this
one
up
and
the
flavor
is
there
middling
for
now
dheavy
body
is
very
filling
repeatability
is
low
overall
pretty
good
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
beer
a
pretty
good
porter
indeed
this
porter
pours
a
typical
porter
color
with
a
one
finger
khaki
head
some
lacing
remains
throughout
the
glass
smell
is
chocolaty
and
sweet
think
tootsie
rolls
tastes
sweet
initially
but
finish
has
some
nice
bitterness
this
beer
seems
a
little
thicker
than
some
other
porters
but
it
works
very
well
this
is
not
an
english
porter
imo
i
need
tons
of
roasted
malt
i
do
not
get
that
with
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
a
good
beer
that
i
enjoy
just
not
what
i
think
of
for
the
style
d
i
would
have
to
add
this
to
my
list
of
favorite
porters
nothing
objectionable
about
this
at
all
for
an
american
version
of
a
british
ale
this
one
is
spoton
now
this
is
a
damn
good
porter
more
tasty
than
most
aroma
was
a
little
weak
hints
of
chocolate
were
there
but
slight
pour
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
ring
for
a
head
the
flavor
was
big
for
a
porter
strong
chocolate
malt
in
the
beginning
which
is
very
sweet
then
a
bitter
roastiness
comes
in
and
balances
it
out
with
a
dry
finish
thick
and
chewy
but
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
nice
overall
a
good
sessionable
porter
pairs
very
well
with
white
cheddar
cheezits
future
outlook
probably
wont
seek
this
out
but
it
seems
to
be
a
nice
addition
to
the
mountain
mixer
in
which
it
came
overall
i
like
it
its
a
very
smooth
porter
i
could
be
quite
happy
drinking
four
of
five
of
these
in
an
evening
overall
definitely
drinkable
needs
a
stronger
aftertaste
to
bring
it
up
a
notch
but
its
certainly
a
good
brew
that
id
go
for
again
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
heavier
certainly
not
thin
but
then
again
this
is
an
english
porter
drinkability
is
pretty
high
solid
brew
nothing
that
really
stands
out
but
solid
anyways
this
is
a
solid
beer
ill
certainly
recommend
to
my
pals
that
they
offer
it
a
shot
also
even
though
i
write
with
my
right
i
swing
lefty
the
aroma
is
a
rich
blend
of
semisweet
chocolate
light
java
and
cream
the
flavor
follows
up
with
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
at
the
end
in
addition
to
the
chocolate
grains
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
could
be
more
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
balanced
and
while
this
is
a
bigger
beer
its
still
fairly
drinkable
worth
a
try
for
a
big
chocolatey
porter
m
d
a
crisp
carbonation
maybe
a
little
sharp
but
not
too
much
a
nice
roundness
to
the
body
that
kinda
saves
it
its
a
good
enough
beer
not
the
best
ive
experienced
but
not
too
shabby
overall
drink
ability
was
good
one
or
two
bottles
at
a
time
have
bought
this
beer
many
times
and
would
recommend
to
others
the
beer
pours
a
clear
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
garnet
hue
the
head
is
thin
and
tan
the
aroma
is
chocolately
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
quite
chocolately
bittersweet
and
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
carbonation
is
mediumlow
and
body
medium
overall
an
easy
drinking
flavorful
porter
not
bad
for
a
porter
i
like
the
simple
flavors
that
make
up
the
layers
of
this
beer
dark
but
not
too
dark
sweet
but
not
overly
saccharine
bitter
but
not
too
sour
i
think
this
is
a
good
workhorse
of
a
beer
it
isnt
a
very
big
or
innovative
porter
but
it
has
my
thumbs
up
pitch
black
colored
porter
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
a
strong
mocha
coffee
taste
is
chocolatecoffee
and
burnt
malts
this
is
very
smooth
and
goes
down
like
water
highly
recommendedanother
great
job
by
the
people
at
left
hand
brewing
company
lightmedium
in
body
with
unobtrusive
carbonation
its
like
left
hand
took
a
decent
porter
cut
it
with
mineral
water
and
bottled
it
the
end
product
is
entirely
drinkable
but
pretty
forgettable
complex
solid
flavors
and
smooth
textures
make
this
brew
quite
enjoyable
i
only
had
one
but
it
made
an
impression
recommended
to
the
porter
lovers
out
there
overall
a
pretty
decent
and
slighty
unusual
porter
well
worth
a
try
maybe
a
bit
thin
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
flavors
its
dark
but
some
light
does
make
it
through
especially
around
the
edges
tan
head
that
falls
away
quickly
the
smell
actually
seems
to
be
roasted
barley
the
taste
as
well
contains
an
aspect
of
burnt
smokiness
that
i
dont
expect
from
a
porter
mild
hop
bitterness
is
in
line
with
the
english
porter
style
a
little
dense
creamy
pretty
good
stuff
a
fairly
decent
porter
nothing
harsh
or
overly
bitter
or
burnt
here
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
in
color
with
a
hint
of
red
absolute
minimal
head
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
was
not
prominently
displayed
but
it
was
evident
that
this
porter
would
have
some
sweetness
to
it
very
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
porter
but
creamy
and
very
smooth
the
best
thing
going
for
this
one
is
the
flavor
i
didnt
expect
much
based
on
the
aroma
and
appearance
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
was
correct
to
expect
a
sweet
taste
to
this
one
chocolate
malts
easily
make
themselves
known
and
are
well
blended
with
other
roasted
and
coffee
malt
flavors
a
slight
hoppiness
is
present
which
i
think
really
brings
this
porter
full
circle
well
made
overall
although
i
wish
it
had
a
thicker
body
to
it
i
would
surely
try
this
one
again
preferably
on
tap
served
a
nice
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
a
decent
blend
of
carmel
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
a
slightly
bitter
chocolate
with
some
undertoned
hops
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
low
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
porter
for
a
cool
rainy
afternoon
drinkability
is
excellent
im
glad
i
tried
this
and
will
make
it
a
regular
purchase
for
me
definitely
enjoyable
all
year
long
but
im
really
looking
forward
to
enjoying
this
in
the
winter
maybe
while
cooking
some
smores
in
front
of
the
fire
i
suppose
it
would
make
for
a
good
summer
drinker
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
rubybrown
almost
black
with
a
thin
milky
head
the
smell
is
not
overwhelming
but
is
of
strongly
roasted
notes
and
chocolate
malt
the
taste
has
a
similar
profile
with
a
touch
of
peat
smokiness
at
the
end
a
decently
balanced
beer
but
definitely
malt
forward
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
minimal
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
stands
out
in
my
mind
either
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
definitely
several
other
porters
that
i
would
pick
first
d
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
its
not
going
to
blow
you
a
way
but
its
a
good
easy
to
drink
porter
with
a
good
taste
to
it
thats
worth
trying

flavors
the

black

is
a
pretty
decent

really
doesnt
stand
out
enough
for
me
to
purchase
again
i
had
tried
a
left
hand
beer
a
few
years
ago
i
thought
it
was
horrible
tho
my
taste
buds
were
too
immature
for
these
beers
this
is
a
good
beer
regaining
positive
reputation
in
my
book
for
left
hand
im
happy
i
brought
home
the
mountain
mix
pack
and
id
buy
this
porter
again
sufficient
carbonation
full

i
like
this
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
porters
and
this
one
i
would
buy
again
pours
up
black
with
little
to
no

not
much
retentive
lacing
nose
is
chocolate
malts
coffee
lil
caramel
taste
is
same
as
nose
with
some
hop
crispness
in
the
mix
pretty
light
bodied
easy
drinkin
low
to
medium
carbo
im
not
much
for
porters
but
this
one
is
definately
drinkable
d
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
fan
of
porters
though
i
like
some
others
better
such
as
sierra
nevada
left
hand
beers
tend
to
be
around
1112
a
six
around
here
which
i
think
hurts
this
beer
since
its
not
even
my
favorite
porter
yet
cost
more
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
and
i
do
like
it
enough
to
buy
again
i
like
this
better
than
the
left
hand
milk
stout
drinkability
ok
but
nothing
spectacular
maybe
my
taste
buds
are
off
or
something
but
i
cant
find
too
much
to
be
impressed
about
with
this
porter
to
celebrate
me
birthday
very
roasty
a
bit
thin
but
highly
drinkable
nice
aftertaste
strange
but
likeable
just
cant
put
my
digit
on
it
my
server

she
saw

another
in

line
of

from

graces
my
glass
this
one
i
was
looking
forward
to
as
the
porters
have
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
this
one
poured
a
nice
thick
dark
brown
with
a
large
creamy
tan
colored
head
on
the
top
great
retention
let
it
hang
around
for
what
seemed
like
forever
before
finally
being
nestled
down
into
just
a
thin
layer
across
the
top
the
aroma
was
very
full
and
sweet
lots
of
chocolate
roaming
through
it
along
with
a
touch
of
coffee
and
lots
of
sugar
a
slight
smoked
presentation
as
well
the
flavor
was
also
very
full
for
a
porter
this
almost
had
a
stout
like
feel
to
it
as
it
was
very
thick
and
full
with
a
great
robust
profile
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
dominated
it
overall
it
was
hard
to
believe
this
was
actually
not
a
stout
it
was
so
full
bodied
and
i
cant
say
that
left

has
wowed

powerful

the

with
underlying

roasty

mostly
its

pretty
thin
overall
chocolate
again
comes
out
strong
in
the
flavor
with
some
loud
esters
and
a
toasty
yet
midly
roasty
and
lactic
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
yet
smooth
not
interested
wont
buy
this
again
left
hands
black
jack
porter
is
a
pretty
decent
english
porter
but
theres
something
about
it
that
keeps
me
from
drinking
it
more
often
maybe
its
the
aroma
it
starts
off
pleasant
enough
reminiscent
of
dark
chocolate
covered
malt
balls
and
with
moderate
fruity
esters
that
become
more
prominent
as
the
beer
warms
the
taste
has
toffee
and
licorice
overtones
that
blend
well
and
achieve
a
slightly
bitter
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
the
black
jack
is
a
tasty
beer
but
theres
something
about
the
finish
and
the
lingering
aftertaste
that
keeps
me
from
getting
too
excited
about
this
beer
a
very
drinkable
english
porter
with
an
interesting
american
twist
its
a
bit
heavy
so
no
more
than
2
at
a
sitting
but
this
is
a
winner
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
porter
very
gassy
which
is
also
not
very
porterlike
drinkable
for
basically
an
average
effort
at
brewing
overall
give
this
beer
a
try
it
makes
me
what
to
explore
more
porters
pours
a
deep
brown
with
moderate
head
thorough
lacing
impressive
for
a
porter
sweet
with
no
lack
of
flavor
doesnt
disappoint
not
my
favorite
style
but
if
youre
in
the
market
for
a
porter
this
one
is
worth
a
try
wont
leave
you
hanging
on
the
finish
complex
enough
to
engage
the
pallete
though
worth
a
try
pours
the
darkest
of
brownswith
a
redish
hue
in
the
light
thin
tan
headnot
much
retentionbut
a
good
lacing
aroma
body
is
medium
with
some
carbionation
roasted
coffeeand
dark
chocolate
nicebut
not
very
strong
taste
is
of
bittersweet
chocolateand
coffee
nice
sweetness
tio
the
finish
an
ok
porter
darkly
translucent
that
is
a
few
steps
away
from
opaque
and
has
a
rich
brownmahogany
color
tan
head
that
started
off
big
and
then
gradually
dies
down
lacing
was
quite
good
roasted
and
caramel
sweetness
some
coffee
and
a
touch
of
earth
in
the
smell
roasted
nuttiness
hits
first
in
the
taste
and
sweetness
thats
close
to
molasses
but
not
that
sharp
comes
in
after
also
seems
light
a
bit
of
butterscotch
but
that
may
be
how
im
tasting
the
sweetness
if
theres
any
coffee
in
the
taste
it
comes
through
more
in
the
not
unpleasant
resinoiliness
of
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
light
apparent
carbonation
so
i
can
see
why
some
would
call
it
thin
for
me
though
the
mouthfeel
struck
a
great
balance
not
too
drying
or
too
sweet
in
the
end
solid
effort
for
me
this
is
a
buy
again

drinks
too
easy
for
the
abv
this
odells
cutthroat
new
world
avery
porter
are
two
of
the
better
porters
on
offer
from
the
centennial
state
imo
would
pair
great
with
dessert
or
game
might
marinade
some
elk
steaks
i
have
in
this
good
brew
very
dark
color
thin
head
that
i
keeps
fairly
tight
but
some
big
bubbles
very
nice
lacing
nice
roasted
malt
odor
semi
sweet
coffeeish
taste
distinct
coffee
aftertaste
nice
carbonation
level
and
the
roasted
malts
are
obviously
a
major
presence
reminded
me
of
burnt
chocolate
milk
great
cold
weather
brew
a
tasty
porter
malty
but
with
some
balance
a
nice
example
of
the
style
d
disappeared
quickly
and
i
wasnt
in
love
with
the
taste
i
would
imagine
a
coffee
drinker
could
guzzle
this
all
night
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
there
are
many
i
like
better
though
this
is
the
worst
of
the
left
hand
brews
i
picked
up
but
its
no
slap
on
the
brewer
they
make
solid
micro
brews
but
nothing
i
have
tried
as
of
yet
is
earth
shattering
in
the
micro
world
if
your
a
porterman
add
this
one
to
your
resume
it
is
worth
tasting
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
for
me
anyway
drinkability
not
my
favorite
porter
but
not
bad
i
will
have
more
of
these
and
would
recommend
them
a
solid
looking
blackishbrown
color
and
a
twofinger
head
that
fills
the
pint
glass
the
head
holds
as
a
light
brown
cover
throughout
the
aroma
is
rich
and
immediately
gives
off
vanilla
followed
by
a
little
maltiness
first
taste
blends
the
same
malty
warmth
with
dry
smokiness
at
times
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
taste
but
as
you
drink
it
you
kind
of
adjust
and
it
settles
into
a
substantial
flavor
experience
ideally
it
would
be
a
bit
more
drinkable
for
me
if
the
bitterness
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
but
this
is
a
finely
crafted
brew
there
is
a
subtle
chocolate
hint
as
well
but
it
gets
hidden
at
times
good
porter
easy
to
drink
a
few
drinkability
a
definite
winter
quaffer
imo
the
higher
alcohol
content
keeps
this
from
being
anything
that
one
would
session
with
instead
it
had
the
feel
of
a
nice
sipper
on
a
cold
winter
day
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
rich
porter
with
a
nice
balance
of
crystal
malts
and
subtle
hop
bitterness
the
coffee
bean
unsweetened
chocolate
taste
is
quite
prevelant
along
with
some
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
thin
but
overall
not
bad
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
perfect
for
a
cooler
evening
its
mediumbodied
and
easy
drinking
has
nice
complexity
as
is
oscillates
back
between
the
sweetbittersweet
and
the
roasted
and
charred
elements
would
not
turn
one
of
these
down
mouth
starts
in
the
mouth
smooth
and
on
the
sweeter
side
which
progressively
gets
more
bitter
and
chewy
as
it
moves
back
and
the
roast
malts
come
out
notes
of
stone
fruits
and
brown
sugar
excellent
malt
profile
mouthfeel
is
strongly
carbonated
and
completely
drinkable
i
keep
telling
myself
no
more
from
left
hand
but
i
am
running
out
of
new
things
to
try
at
grapevine
pours
dark
pretty
much
black
aroma
is
very
light
with
sweet
malts
and
i
think
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
weak
with
just
a
little
hops
and
some
sourbitterness
at
the
end
not
the
worst
porter
but
again
nothing
near
the
best
not
much
else
to
say
not
really
sure
what
to
think
about
this
beer
it
pours
a
very
unimpressive
head
yet
its
full
of
bubbles
odd
its
very
dark
amber
not
much
light
gets
through
so
it
might
as
well
be
black
the
smell
is
pretty
weak
nothing
to
talk
about
imo
the
taste
isnt
bad
its
just
not
interesting
or
good
its
toasty
which
can
be
good
but
in
of
itself
isnt
anything
special
its
got
another
sort
of
fruit
flavored
mostly
just
a
weak
sweat
flavor
the
bubbles
and
light
flavor
work
well
in
the
mouth
if
you
want
a
beer
to
drink
a
few
of
i
could
definately
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
i
like
the
flavor
more
i
mean
its
not
bad
i
could
definately
drink
a
6
pack
if
i
had
it
around
after
all
quite
pleasant
and
drinkable
this
is
a
great
bud
lite
for
beer
folks
flavor
and
a
bit
of
depth
but
a
water
filled
session
beer
all
at
once
color
was
an
opaque
black
with
abundant
head
aroma
was
a
lightly
sweet
roastiness
flavor
was
a
muted
roastiness
with
an
aforementioned
vegetable
taste
i
didnt
really
enjoy
mouthfeel
was
unremarkable
allinall
i
wouldn
not
recommend
this
beer
dark
and
robust
flavors
with
cocoa
caramel
chocolate
syrup
and
coffee
a
nice
porter
quality
with
that
roasted
malt
profile
that
i
enjoy
a
touch
of
sour
dairy
mixes
in
with
a
mini
hop
bite
on
the
finish
solid
drinkability
level
overall
pours
almost
black
with
deep
ruby
highlights
nice
tan
two
finger
head
holds
very
well
and
with
good
lacing
to
the
finish
nose
is
big
roasted
malts
with
coffee
and
toffee
aromas
taste
same
with
slight
hop
bite
ending
very
balanced
malt
and
hop
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
had
five
for
the
review
guess
thats
a
good
sign
of
its
drinkability
lol
this
is
a
great
reason
of
why
i
love
porters
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownalmost
black
forming
a
thick
creamy
1
inch
head
that
slowly
fades
leaving
medium
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
heavy
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
thick
roasted
malt
creating
a
delicious
coffee
flavor
this
is
what
a
porter
should
taste
like
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
finish
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
imho
this
is
definitely
what
i
expect
from
a
porter
pours
a
nice
dark
brownblack
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
foamy
tan
head
which
lasts
awhile
nice
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
nice
roasted
sweet
malts
toffeecaramel
the
taste
is
very
nice
sweetroasted
malts
and
toffeecaramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
little
porter
highly
recommended
heavily
roasted
malt
in
the
flavor
with
coffee
tones
and
a
small
bit
of
tempering
hop
bitterness
well
balanced
flavor
matches
themedium
mouthfeel
that
sstarts
carbonated
and
flattens
out
at
the
end
nicely
rounding
the
prolonging
the
mellow
aftertaste
almost
no
hint
of
alcohol
at
all
which
is
impressive
a
extremely
sessionable
and
likable
porter
ill
definitely
look
for
this
again
this
is
still
a
really
good
porter
with
a
lot
of
dark
roasted
character
probably
the
best
ive
had
in
the
state
d
despite
not
being
as
heavy
as
most
porters
or
as
rich
i
still
really
enjoyed
it
i
drank
it
as
more
of
an
aftermeal
beer
but
i
wish
i
had
consumed
it
during
the
meal
instead
not
as
expected
but
still
enjoyable
i
like
porters
but
they
are
not
my
favorite
stylei
could
see
how
this
could
be
a
session
beer
for
people
that
really
favor
porters
the
taste
is
very
nice
full
bodied
malty
and
rich
the
steely
maltiness
melds
into
the
chocolate
malt
and
again
the
hops
this
time
in
the
form
of
a
slight
bitterness
accents
the
overall
taste
there
is
also
more
of
a
hop
character
to
this
porter
due
to
the
magnum
and
u
s
goldings
used
making
it
more
balanced
and
less
malty
not
as
roasty
as
alot
of
porters
but
is
more
true
to
the
engish
porter
style
with
a
complex
balance
of
young
and
old
flavours
very
complex
with
differnet
flavours
in
every
sip
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeel
also
fits
the
beer
itself
and
style
well
drinkability
is
good
as
well
rougly
pours
a
nice
big
head
with
a
black
color
the
smell
is
soooo
good
it
has
the
smooth
roasted
malts
that
actually
remind
me
of
a
breakfast
stout
the
taste
is
even
smoother
with
chocolately
roasted
coffee
malts
that
are
just
great
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
no
bumps
but
it
is
a
medium
bodied
porter
still
pretty
good
though
overall
i
will
go
back
and
buy
a
bunch
of
this
very
good
interesting
stout
first
english
stout
ive
had
so
i
will
rate
based
upon
enjoyment
a
very
nice
porter
great
beer
to
wash
down
roasted
pork
with
rice
and
beans
a
decent
effort
and
well
worth
a
try
if
you
can
pick
up
a
bottle
at
your
local
store
or
bar
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
there
is
a
great
deal
of
flavor
without
it
being
too
strong
and
its
just
heavy
enough
to
be
fullbodied
though
not
thick
or
chewy
drinkability
i
got
to
say
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
porter
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
i
could
see
drinking
this
all
day
as
you
unload
the
ships
overall
nice
and
simple
this
beer
doesnt
try
to
innovate
or
impress
my
only
complaint
is
with
the
full
mouthfeel
which
seems
a
bit
full
even
for
a
robust
porter
i
do
love
the
balance
between
the
sweetish
start
and
the
bitterness
that
lingers
into
the
finish
i
think
ill
have
another
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
a
brewed
on
date
on
the
front
label
color
was
black
unless
held
right
to
a
light
where
it
was
a
deep
deep
mahogany
had
about
2
fingers
of
brownish
foam
that
evaporated
to
a
thin
head
and
lacing
during
the
drink
the
smell
was
really
off
on
this
one
for
what
i
expected
not
sure
if
something
happened
during
shipment
but
it
a
really
strange
aroma
that
i
couldnt
identify
even
had
the
wife
who
is
good
at
picking
out
smells
try
it
and
she
said
ugh
thats
awful
in
the
background
i
could
smell
the
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
but
overpowered
by
the
other
ill
rate
a
3
as
a
mix
of
what
i
got
1
and
what
others
have
said
4
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
but
a
little
on
the
watery
side
the
taste
was
excellent
a
year
ago
i
wouldnt
drink
a
porter
if
offered
but
ive
really
developed
a
taste
for
them
lately
overall
another
outstanding
beer
from
left
hand
who
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
highly
recommend

rr
ty
this
is
one
easy
to
drink
brew
im
glad
i
have
some
more
to
drink
in
this
cold
weather
after
a
very
promising
start
this
beer
kind
of
went
to
tasting
like
a
watery
tea
made
from
dried
hay
glad
for
the
chance
to
have
tried
this
but
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
based
on
this
bottle
drinkability
best
porter
ive
had
so
far
this
year
doesnt
try
to
overdo
it
with
the
coffeeroasted
flavors
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
left
recommended
oh
well
their
stouts
are
very
nice
but
this
porter
is
a
pass
perfect
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
smooth
and
medium
bodied
this
is
very
drinkable
this
is
complex
enought
to
be
sipped
and
savored
but
light
and
enjoyable
enough
to
be
enjoyed
with
food
or
as
a
session
brew
overall
good
beer
the
taste
was
a
bit
grainy
and
chalky
but
it
still
held
its
own
i
recommend
you
try
this
one
at
least
once
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
d
very
nice
porter
nothing
over
the
top
but
very
well
done
for
the
style
the
body
is
between
mid
to
full
carbonation
is
light
but
somewhat
masked
by
the
smooth
texture
overall
a
good
porter
but
not
something
i
would
bet
the
house
on
pours
a
blackish
red
color
with
a
1
inch
fluffy
head
smell
is
very
faint
but
a
i
smell
some
roasted
peanuts
in
the
mix
the
taste
is
a
a
very
unbalance
hoppyroasted
character
it
actually
reminds
me
of
roeasted
grasshoppers
that
i
had
before
this
is
a
decent
offering
from
left
hand
that
i
had
in
the
moutain
mixer
its
all
here
the
coffee
chocolate
and
such
comes
off
thick
enough
and
chewy
drinkable
on
a
nice
summer
day
da
very
drinkable
porter
heavy
on
the
chocolatemight
be
a
good
winter
beer
although
it
is
very
good
in
july
as
well
d
results
in
a
high
drinkability
for
any
porter
lover
otherwise
it
may
not
be
as
high
overall
impression
nicely
balanced
just
a
bit
thin
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
with
burnt
malt
underneath
the
taste
is
of
burnt
malt
and
chocolate
it
has
an
overall
sweetness
that
is
much
greater
than
any
other
porter
i
have
had
it
isnt
bad
but
also
isnt
quite
to
my
liking
in
a
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
there
are
much
better
porters
out
there
to
be
had
12
oz
bottled
on

sampled
on
424
it
pours
a
deep
dark
brownruby
with
a
half
inch
khaki
head
of
mediumsized
bubbles
the
smell
is
quite
pleasant
with
a
big
roasted
nutty
earthy
quality
along
with
some
coffee
and
perhaps
oats
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
taste
that
resembles
the
aroma
with
lots
of
earthy
malts
with
a
mild
citricpine
hop
profile
that
leaves
a
tamed
bitterness
not
only
did
this
exceed
my
expectations
but
its
also
pretty
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
poor
porter
i
will
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
bottom
line
lf
youre
looking
for
something
dark
that
would
work
in
the
summertime
this
will
probably
work
this
is
a
lighter
version
of
a
porter
i
would
prefer
a
heavier
mouthfeel
and
bolder
flavor
its
not
bad
but
its
too
mild
for
me
to
consider
searching
out
brownishburgundy

a
full

of
light

fairly

pretty
good

notes
of

worth
a
try
for
sure
d
definatly
a
brew
that
hard
liquor
folk
can
enjoy
very
fun
and
intersting
taste
not
going
to
always
keep
it
on
hand
but
will
being
looking
for
it
some
time
down
the
road
very
smooth
and
too
sweet
in
my
eyes
yeah
its
an
english
porter
but
could
have
been
drier
smokiness
and
coffee
make
this
a
decently
complex
brew

concentrationintensive
opinion
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
light
for
my
taste
but
is
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
it
is
hard
to
say
what
i
would
like
better
about
it
except
that
it
finishes
a
bit
acidic
and
would
probably
benefit
from
a
bit
more
basic
water
that
is
about
all
i
have
to
say
cause
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
cheers
i
have
to
admit
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
brew
i
have
been
let
down
the
last
few
times
ive
checked
out
left
hand
brews
but
this
was
impressive
it
poured
with
a
very
dark
blackbrown
body
with
a
small
tan
head
the
aroma
was
suprisingly
wellbalanced
with
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
espresso
deep
roasted
bitter
and
sweet
malts
and
caramel
it
had
a
similar
taste
with
a
toffee
carmely
smokiness
due
ot
the
roasts
but
was
relatively
smooth
and
not
very
overpowering
it
was
definitely
a
sipping
beer
with
a
smooth
warming
mouthfeel
one
of
the
best
from
left
hand
notes
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
and
wish
they
had
this
sitting
on
the
shelves
of
my
local
grocery
store
i
have
had
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
the
left
hand
brewing
company
and
it
looks
like
they
have
struck
gold
again

noted
throughout

initial
palate
is
full
of

traces
of

loads
of

an

very
nice

quite
smootha

english
porter
nice
and
thick
feel
good
charcter
id
drink
this
again
but
id
rather
have
an
edmund
fitzgerald
or
arcadia
london
porter
a
much
better
beer
than
what
i
was
anticipating
a
rich
black
malt
chocolate
and
milk
sweetness
to
the
nose
thick
and
dark
almost
black
with
a
soft
creamy
lightly
tan
head
tastes
creamy
and
bold
without
heavy
sweetness
or
body
chocolatey
robust
toffee
and
espresso
flavored
a
nice
lactose
sweetness
softens
the
beer
considerably
offering
a
fermented
sourness
creamy
and
smooth
texture
finishes
lightly
chocolatey
modestly
sweet
and
clean
for
a
porter
hinges
on
a
milk
stout
otherwise
a
terriffic
porter
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
a
fine
beer
but
id
be
unwilling
to
buy
it
again
given
the
other
choices
on
the
market
give
me
a
free
bottle
or
a
lack
of
other
choices
and
its
what
id
drink
bonus
points
for
a
solid

alcohol
when
many
competitors
are
closer
to
5
than
6
left
hand
is
capable
of
brewing
outstanding
dark
beer
imperial
stout
and
lousy
dark
beer
milk
stout
black
jack
porter
falls
somewhere
in
the
cavernous
middle
its
okay
i
suppose
and
should
be
acceptable
to
a
wide
range
of
beer
drinkers
but
im
trying
my
damnedest
to
suppress
a
yawn
d
the
slight
sweetness
and
darker
malts
add
some
interest
but
the
finish
doesnt
offer
much
deep
brown
to
black
with
a
thin
tan
colored
head
the
nose
is
dominated
by
milk
chocolate
there
is
a
touch
of
roast
malt
and
just
a
little
citrus
in
the
end
the
flavor
has
the
milk
chocolate
followed
by
roast
malt
its
almost
a
burnt
malt
character
a
bit
of
sweetness
accompanies
a
mild
citrus
finish
that
gives
it
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
offsets
the
chocolate
well
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thin
a
bit
slick
drinkability
is
ok
this
one
was
off
to
the
races
from
sip
one
it
goes
from
start
to
finish
in
a
flash
denting
the
consciousness
but
barely
the
elements
blink
on
and
off
too
quickly
to
fully
develop
which
is
a
shame
because
they
all
show
some
promise
it
is
drinkable
and
is
in
no
way
a
labor
but
thats
partly
because
you
need
more
in
your
mouth
to
keep
the
flavor
from
being
forgotten
so
a
quick
next
sip
is
mandatory
its
fair
enough
but
only
that
what
with
its
happy
feet
and
all
this
beer
is
worth
checking
out
overall
a
nice
smoky
porter
would
recommend
to
people
who
are
fans
of
sierra
nevadas
porter
doesnt
have
the
same
chemical
smokeyness
of
ofallons
smoked
has
a
natural
smokiness
which
seems
to
stem
from
the
malt
i
like
left
hands
pale
ale
but
this
has
to
beat
it
pours
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
short
lighttan
head
that
soon
fades
into
a
bubbly
lace
nose
is
chocolaty
malts
and
smoky
charcoal
body
seems
a
bit
thin
taste
begins
with
sweet
malt
and
dark
toffee
followed
by
cocoa
and
some
more
smokiness
grassy
and
mildly
spicy
hops
show
up
in
the
finish
a
decent
porter
but
nothing
all
that
special
overall
impression
almost
too
easy
to
drink
light
body
watery
texture
mild
taste
i
guess
that
equals
good
session
beer
the
flavor
is
ok
nose
is
good
looks
good
mouthfeel
is
lacking
whats
the
opposite
of
imperial
porter
this
porter
is
very
good
and
worth
trying
it
is
a
little
wet
and
overcoffee
for
my
tastes
but
it
is
definitely
in
the
realm
of
a
very
good
beer
the
color
is
a
dark
nutty
brown
with
an
averagesized
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
dark
malts
with
just
a
touch
of
roast
the
overall
taste
is
a
little
sweeter
and
not
quite
as
rich
as
most
porters
ive
tried
i
think
that
is
why
im
enjoying
this
beer
so
damn
much
the
primary
malt
flavor
is
still
of
dark
malts
with
an
ample
chocolate
flavor
but
sweeter
than
expected
with
perhaps
a
mild
caramel
malt
taste
roast
flavors
come
into
play
towards
the
middle
of
a
sip
and
help
carry
an
extra
long
sweet
finish
black
jacks
longlasting
finish
has
to
be
the
highlight
here
the
flavor
from
a
sip
seems
to
last
forever
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
porters
the
sweet
complexity
leaves
me
craving
more
a
big
thanks
to
left
hand
for
bringing
this
beer
to
texas
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
but
not
too
heavy
one
of
the
better
craft
porters
a
style
that
is
very
often
overlooked
i
could
easily
session
this
one
maybe
even
put
it
on
the
fridge
rotation
overall
comments
very
true
to
style
for
an
english
porter
goes
down
easy
smooth
as
a
babys
bottom
tasty
to
boot
and
i
can
get
it
fresh
anytime
i
want

so
eat
your
heart
out
great
brew
black
in
colour
with
muted
aromas
of
roasted
nuts
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
smoke
the
flavor
was
far
less
sweet
than
i
had
expected
the
roasted
grain
chalkiness
was
the
dominant
flavor
little
hop
presence
to
speak
of
and
not
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
body
either
perhaps
this
was
an
old
bottle
either
way
ive
had
better
porters
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
red
tones
a
nice
tan
head
poured
at
the
start
but
disappeared
without
a
trace
within
a
minute
nose
is
detecting
chocolate
roasted
malts
taste
is
balanced
more
towards
the
chocolate
roasted
malts
as
the
hop
presence
is
barely
discernable
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
but
thin
for
the
style
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
one
i
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
the
taste
is
light
up
front
but
followed
by
a
rich
roasted
caramel
not
and
a
bit
of
chalkiness
up
front
i
get
sweet
fruity
notes
of
burnt
raisins
as
well
as
some
nice
rich
chocolate
notes
this
is
a
really
nice
malty
porter
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
notes
just
a
mix
of
sweet
and
dark
malt
notes
while
i
really
like
the
malt
character
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
thin
to
solely
rest
on
it
there
needs
to
be
a
bit
more
hops
or
a
thicker
body
to
support
and
compliment
the
lush
maltiness
of
this
porter
i
dont
find
anything
much
stands
out
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
great
once
again
my
chocolate
milk
analogy
comes
to
mind
though
this
is
somewhat
watery
even
for
a
porter
much
less
a
milk
still
has
a
creamy
feel
to
it
which
is
delightful
though
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
porter
next
to
bully
porter
this
one
is
a
certainly
lighter
than
your
average
porter
a
blood
red
color
almost
with
dark
brown
hues
as
opposed
to
dark
brown
with
red
as
most
porters
tend
to
be
smell
is
a
bit
odd
nice
and
malty
though
but
theres
a
kind
of
disagreeable
soy
sauce
taste
i
just
recently
had
a
sam
adams
triple
bock
which
i
thought
was
terrible
and
ultra
soy
saucy
so
maybe
im
sensitive
to
that
smell
lets
see
how
it
tastes
ehhh
its
ok
not
as
rich
as
i
was
expecting
malty
of
course
roasty
and
a
bit
of
coffee
taste
though
that
odd
soy
sauce
is
there
i
dont
know
what
that
is
anyone
very
strange
and
not
in
a
good
way
thin
watery
mouthfeel
and
not
really
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
you
want
another
as
sood
as
youre
done
get
something
else
instead
of
this
very
very
dark
brown
color
on
top
completely
opaque
until
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
head
foames
up
nicely
falls
down
to
a
solid
layer
of
creamy
foam
nice
strong
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
acidity
and
frosting
sweetness
present
taste
has
very
well
balanced
flavors
but
lean
toawrd
the
understated
side
low
acidity
evident
which
is
a
plus
in
my
book
coffee
tones
are
full
and
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
full
and
well
carbonated
a
good
change
after
the
flat
beer
i
have
been
getting
lately
see
viking
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
it
isnt
my
favorite
porter
but
it
is
still
pretty
good
overall
worth
a
try
certainly
notes
light
to
medium
body
good
mouthfeel
leaves
a
dry
aftertaste
its
good
but
not
as
well
balanced
or
full
bodied
as
i
expect
and
enjoy
very
drinkable
for
a
6
4
beer
the
color
of
lapsang
souchong
tea
and
a
bit
of
that
flavor
as
well
thin
brew
little
froth
less
lacing
if
it
were
all
a
wee
more
itd
be
great
everything
is
in
balance
here
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
smokey
chaser
that
adds
some
musty
dryness
its
just
not
big
enough
i
mean
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
but
its
not
real
satisfying
reviewed
from
a
22oz
bomber
on
122704
pours
out
brown
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
slight
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
no
lace
or
bubbles
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
caramel
make
up
the
aroma
taste
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
before
a
bit
of
chocolate
comes
in
a
bit
plain
overall
and
it
lacks
any
significant
roastiness
mouthfeel
is
about
expected
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
nothing
special
or
bad
just
your
average
run
of
the
mill
porter
drinkability
this
is
the
type
of
porter
that
could
be
thoroughly
enjoyed
at
almost
any
time
of
year
why
the
beer
is
simply
very
wellbalanced
not
at
all
heavy
has
a
clean
palette
but
is
chock
full
of
complexities
quaff
or
savored
this
is
a
wellbuilt
porter
body
is
thin
short
clean
finish
poured
a
pretty
looking
black
with
an
ivory
head
strong
smells
of
black
licorice
coffee
chocolate
the
beer
was
a
little
watery
and
lighter
than
i
hoped
for
looking
for
something
to
chew
on
here
the
taste
was
above
average
toasty
marshmallow
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
flavors
no
noticeable
hop
flavor
but
lots
of
malty
goodness
an
ok
porter
that
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
palate
starts
with
inyourface
roasty
sweetness
almost
too
sweet
up
front
sweetness
is
partially
tempered
by
some
roasted
coffee
bitterness
a
little
sweet
for
me
big
bodied
with
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
off
fast
the
aroma
is
very
chocolaty
with
some
hints
of
coffee
and
other
malts
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
a
semisweet
malt
comprised
mostly
of
a
chocolate
flavor
and
backed
with
some
coffee
very
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
great
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
good
porter
this
beer
departs
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
ruby
hue
the
head
is
a
finger
that
falls
to
ring
the
beer
the
nose
is
all
about
chocolate
damn
it
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
also
a
huge
blast
of
chocolate
that
sticks
with
me
way
through
the
finish
the
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
the
drinkability
is
really
good
as
well
i
like
this
beer
for
my
friend
don
this
is
just
a
good
beer
medium
bodied
smooth
at
the
start
and
finish
witht
he
roasted
malts
lasting
briefly
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
very
drinakble
as
this
follows
the
porter
style
well
a
session
beer
with
just
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
all
day
no
bottled
on
date
listed
could
not
find
abv
though
this
site
says
6
4
and
i
bought
this
in
a
state
that
unfortunately
could
not
sell
beer
over
6
nice
color
porter
that
had
little
head
and
even
less
carbonation
great
taste
for
a
porter
though
a
stronger
than
average
aftertaste
no
real
sensation
on
the
tongue
but
a
drinkable
beer
nonetheless
definitely
try
this
porter
out
this
is
a
porter
that
pushes
the
brown
ale
side
of
the
style
meter
its
a
decent
beverage
but
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
hunt
down
pours
a
slightly
above
average
medium
to
dark
brown
colour
with
pretty
much
no
head
it
looks
almost
like
a
flat
though
slightly
thicker
coke
not
bad
but
not
great
the
aroma
is
mostly
caramel
and
malt
with
some
wood
notes
again
slightly
above
average
at
best
upon
first
taste
you
get
virtually
no
flavour
weird
then
the
burnt
malt
kicks
in
along
with
som
semisweet
chocolate
flavour
and
some
woodcardboard
overall
this
one
was
a
bit
too
thin
and
carbonated
for
my
liking
when
it
comes
to
porters
it
seemed
like
it
was
doing
a
balancing
act
between
brown
ale
and
porter
at
times
and
i
much
prefer
my
porters
to
be
closer
to
the
stout
end
of
the
spectrum
it
isnt
a
bad
brew
its
simply
underwhelming
id
give
it
a
marginal
thumbs
up
but
with
much
room
for
improvement
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
creaminess
however
i
ultimately
dont
find
this
beer
to
be
that
drinkable
pours
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
to
just
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
little
lace
deep
redamber
color
nearly
opaque
light
carbonation
medium
bodied
nose
has
a
hint

starts
with
a
roasted

and
finishes
smooth
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
a
good
porter
nice
to
find
a
12oz
bottle
on
sale
for

from
liquor
barn
lexington
ky
their
site
lists
the
abv
at
5
8
all
and
all
this
was
an
average
porter
in
my
opinion
it
was
too
thin
and
watery
still
it
was
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
final
thought
i
was
disappointed
with
this
since
my
acquaintance
and
owner
of
the
liquor
store
praised
it
still
pretty
good
though
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dark
roasted
malt
scent
with
little
hops
and
a
dry
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
grainy
dark
malt
flavor
with
a
dry
finish
it
is
watery
and
weak
tasting
the
mouthfeel
is
horrible
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
little
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
average
it
has
little
aroma
and
flavor
along
with
almost
no
carbonation
this
is
a
average
porter
at
best
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
a
trace
of
lacingaroma
of
coffee
and
fruit
with
some
bitter
chocolate
as
well
but
it
is
subdued
taste
has
a
fruity
edge
to
it
with
some
milk
chocolate
and
earth
it
mingles
pretty
well
together
a
pretty
solid
porter
what
have
liked
a
little
more
muscle
to
it
but
good
none
the
less
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
formed
a
small
12
beige
head
over
the
dark
reddish
brown
brew
good
lacing
and
this
offering
has
a
light
aroma
of
hearty
malts
taste
is
sweetly
of
the
dark
grains
a
combination
of
what
seems
to
be
coffee
chocolate
and
maybe
rauch
the
mouthfeel
is
excellently
smooth
even
if
a
bit
too
sweet
a
bit
heavy
for
major
drinkability
but
certainly
would
have
another
blown
away
by
another
brew
from
this
company
i
saw
their
cheesy
labels
and
wasnt
expecting
much
ive
been
surprised
by
each
one
that
ive

give
me
a
6er
of
this
is
one
hand
and
a
6er
of

with

imho

more
of

drinkability
was

good
went

probably
a
good

overall
a
decent
offering
the

a
mild

with
a
suttle

noticeable

head
not
a
creamy
porter
but
tasty

of

tickle
your
tongue
while
a

not
your

up
by

that
complements
the

quite
well

still

very

depsite
the
lack
of
body
in
this
beer
a
significant
factor
to
my
personal
enjoyment
of
porter
styles
it
is
still
quite
good
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
left
hand
brewing
company
and
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
more
of
there
offerings
a
good
porter
that
has
a
decent
appearance
light
nose
and
good
taste
the
body
is
a
deep
reddish
brown
and
pulls
up
a
reasonable
creamcolored
head
and
leaves
minimal
lace
effect
the
nose
is
smoky
and
also
a
bit
sweet
smelling
the
flavor
is
a
chocolate
and
carmel
delight
that
takes
the
smoky
nose
and
buries
it
in
sweetness
and
good
maltiness
the
body
is
too
flat
however
and
lets
down
on
supporting
the
fullness
of
the
flavor
still
drinkability
is
enhanced
by
the
good
flavor
and
only
slightly
elevated

this
beer
is

also
present

a

are

a

very
smooth

although
feels
a

which
i
found
to
be
easy
drinking
while
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
id
certainly
try
it
again
if
the
opportunity
came
up
pours
a
dark

sudsy

relatively
stable

is
of

id
call

a
little
on

at
times
it
seems
a
little
acidic
dont

then
takes
a
turn
the

a

the

turns
watery
i
gave
it
lower

for

for
this
reason
i
am
still
glad
to
see
it
florida
and
would
buy
it

that
was

the
taste
was

still

for

have

its
a

porter
for
sure
but
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
its

it

the

inexplicably
the

right
along

a

this
porter
has
a

it

not

other
porters
good
flavor
if
a
bit
light
with
chocolate
overtones
not
one
of
the
best
ones
out
there

definitly

of
the

along

of

porter
overall
id
drink
it
again
its
a
nice
porter
and
has
some
strength
but
the
strength
is
nicely
offset
by
the
smoothness
of
the
roast
chocolate
and

character
solid
porter
right
here
its
definitely
a
classic
englishstyle
not
sweetened
with
anything
or
loaded
with

flavor
good
balance
really
drinkable
tastes
like
a
porter
should
taste
had
it
on

and
in
a
bottle
and
its
the
same
either
way

is
reflective

with

the

hits
you
right
up

with
a
hind
of

the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
more
chocolate
coming
through
that
leaves
a
bitter

because
of
it
perfect
carbonation
that
isnt

done
over

o
i
think
this
is
a
good
interpretation
of
an
english
porter
o
glad
i
tried
this
again
will
try
again
when
founders
is
unavailable
overall
an
enjoyable
porter
that
fits
the
bill
when
you
are
looking
for
the
style
easy
to
consume
a
definte
sessionable
beer
another
solid
entry
from
the

a

multiple
in

it
nice
and
slow
and
at

and
youll
thank
me
later
bully
porter
was
my
first
porter
in
retrospect
its
a
very
good
straight
porter
while
it
isnt
overly
complex
it
still
has
the
roastiness
bitterness
and
silken
mouthfeel
that
makes
porters
such
a
delightful
drink
to
me
its
a
great
starter
for
people
curious
about
dark
beers
and
a
sentimental
favorite
for
someone
who
is
an
old
man
in
spirit
overall
the
smokiness
of
the
beer
became
more
bearable
as
i
drank
the
beer
still
an
enjoyable
and
traditional
with
the
style
overall
an
enjoyable
porter
pretty
wellbalanced
lots
of
flavor
but
typical
for
the
style
on
par
with
other
porters
around
its
price
10
for
a
six
maybe
even
a
little
better
worth
a
try
bully
pours
a
black
color
with
a
large
fluffy
head
there
is
a
yeasty
aroma
with
smokey
undertones
the
taste
is
a
bit
light
but
has
smokey
flavors
as
well
as
a
roasted
malty
backbone
and
finishes
with
a
yeasty
like
nip
flavors
are
a
bit
watery
and
a
strangeish
aftertaste
overall
its
a
porter
with
wow
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
my
experience
with
boulevard
has
mostly
been
on
the
wheat
side
and
the
single
wide
double
wide
etc
side
was
not
expecting
a
food
quality
offering
excellent
porter
and
one
i
got
from
a
mix
pack
so
i
will
definitely
be
checking
this
out
in
a
sixes
to
explore
more
pours
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
head
smells
amazing
with
the
usual
porter
characteristics
including
a
very
subtle
hop
scent
that
translates
well
into
the
flavor
profile
as
well
only
complaint
was
it
was
a
little
too
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
other
than
that
an
excellent
offering
overall
it
is
an
enjoyable
porter
nothing
spectacular
but
good
for
the
style
boulevard
bully
porter
45
solid
porter
in
my
opinion
it
has
a
nice
range
of
flavor
and
i
wouldnt
mind
knocking
back
a
few
more
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
pry
off
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
this
is
an
amazing
brew
that
can
be
drank
anytime
of
day
it
was
a
perfect
breakfast
choice
and
now
as
i
drink
it
late
at
night
it
shows
its
appeal
there
too
i
would
highly
recommend
this
brew
as
an
example
of
the
quality
beer
that
boulevard
puts
out
thanks
boulevard
overall
good
brew
tasty
and
enough
complexities
to
enjoy
more
than
one
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
glass
pours
a
very
deep
clear
brown
that
you
can
see
through
when
held
up
to
light
has
a
big
cappuccino
colored
head
that
lingers
on
and
also
leaves
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
alcohol
sweetness
the
taste
has
more
complexity
with
some
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
a
little
coffee
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
has
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
but
is
mostly
smooth
and
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
an
above
average
porter
not
mindblowing
but
solid
mouthfeel
very
carbonated
and
thin
got
a
6
pack
of
this
for
12
dollars
and
i
am
happy
with
my
decision
this
porter
is
light
enough
to
drink
anytime
but
also
delivers
a
satisfying
roast
malt
character
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
but
carbonation
is
good
nothing
too
farreaching
here
but
its
well
rounded
and
drinkable
solid
yearround
offering
o
a
nice
enough
robust
porter
boulevard
wasnt
shy
with
the
hopping
the
expected
roasted
malt
tastes
are
forced
to
share
the
spotlight
and
the
hops
even
get
the
better
of
the
tilt
at
times
overall
a
nice
and
full
porter
slightly
above
average
of
the
rest
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
unlike
several
of
boulevards
other
offerings
this
was
a
relatively
fresh
bottle
from
boulevard
poured
with
a
decent
few
fingers
of
head
quite
sweet
and
low
alcohol
but
the
powdered
chocolate
sweetness
was
cut
by
a
nice
hop
addition
the
taste
was
nice
just
missing
the
coffee
and
roast
i
like
in
porters
overall
a
decent
beer
that
id
seek
out
againwould
be
curious
as
to
what
will
happen
to
this
with
time
overall
i
like
this
beerporters
are
always
a
favorite
of
mine
and
this
is
another
good
player
in
the
gameit
doesnt
stand
out
but
it
is
very
enjoyablei
will
keep
this
in
the
rotation
from
time
to
time3
755
o
aside
from
the
aromatic
issues
this
is
a
wonderful
representation
of
the
style
and
i
highly
recommend
it
as
a
session
beer
a
decent
example
of
the
style
not
as
robust
as
i
am
accustomed
to
for
a
porter
and
not
as
hoppy
as
one
would
expect
for
the
american
variety
yet
tasty
nonetheless
notes
its
a
solid
porter
begining
to
end
with
a
good
smooth
finish
cheers
odhas
its
good
and
bad
sips
it
is
quite
a
modest
porter
nothing
truly
unique
or
superbly
attractive
at
its
optimal
temp
it
is
very
easy
to
agree
with
overall
id
had
this
before
but
picked
up
a
boulevard
variety
pack
the
other
night
with
intent
to
review
it
obviously
i
bought
it
a
second
time
and
where
i
live
boulevard
products
are
readily
available
im
a
fan
of
bully
porter
and
will
definitely
buy
it
again
especially
for
the
price
boulevards
variety
packs
are
a
good
deal
try
this
beer
o
very
drinkable
and
not
bad
for
the
price
it
about
about
8
for
the
sixer
o
good
selection
and
porter
o
a
nice
offering
from
boulevard
a
decent
take
on
the
style
o
this
is
a
solid
porter
i
dont
know
if
it
rivals
founders
porter
but
its
good
id
drink
this
again
no
problem
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
rather
sessionable
the
hop
bitterness
sets
it
apart
from
other
porters
oa
decent
porter
but
the
high
level
of
carbonation
and
burnt
notes
were
a
turn
off
o
not
bad
an
average
porter
very
focused
porter
that
drinks
like
kinda
like
a
stout
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
with
a
balanced
sweetness
good
mouthfeel
very
impressed
by
this
one
o
probably
a
bit
closer
to
a
stout
than
a
porter
in
mouthfeel
but
that
likely
improves
it
a
little
in
my
opinion
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
have
another
but
not
sure
this
could
be
a
session
beer

me

plenty

let

you
id
appreciate

this
was
a
good

another

or
two
of

would
be
welcome
too
but
an

to
drink
overall
a

well
done
overall
i
had
this
again
with
a
bbq
burnt

dinner
at
jack
stacks
bbq
in

mo
and
found
this
to
be
a
perfect
union
between
beer
and
bbq
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
how
an
american
porter
should
be
not
too
strong
for
the
weak
of
heart
but
robust
and
satisfying
for
the
experienced
beer
connoisseur
a
nice
porter
d
a
rock
solid
american
porter
lots
of
character
and
flavor
for
its
relatively
low

abv
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
unfortunately
its
not
available
to
me
on
a
regular
basis
boulevard
has
a
very
nice
brew
on
their
hands
o
fairly
nondescript
really
just
ok
there
are
certainly
better
porters
out
there
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
bodied
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
o
a
rock
solid
effort
here
in
a
style
i
am
fairly
unfamiliar
with
certainly
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
again
its
different
than
a
lot
of
porters
definitely
hoppier
considering
they
use
5
kinds
of
hops
thats
not
surprising
this
is
on
the
side
of
hoppy
porter
more
than
it
is
black
ipa
mouthfeel
also
might
not
be
as
creamy
and
smooth
as
other
porters
still
tasty
a
most
excellent
porter
pours
jet
black
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
more
than
2
inches
tall
no
light
gets
through
smells
incredibly
darkly
roasted
coffee
notes
and
some
bold
yeast
as
well
the
flavor
is
extremely
bold
with
just
a
quick
yeast
hit
up
front
followed
by
that
thick
roasted
kick
and
a
bitter
coffeehop
finish
it
really
stands
out
as
unique
to
me
and
just
a
massive
profile
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
over
carbonated
in
my
opinion
full
bodied
to
the
max
but
a
beer
you
could
easily
and
enjoyably
make
a
night
of
bravo
to
boulevard
for
this
gem
overall
very
easy
to
use
this
as
a
session
brew
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
porter
very
well
balanced
not
too
strong
its
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
fluffy
light
brown
head
scent
is
mostly
of
robust
malts
and
cocoa
taste
is
heavy
and
flavorful
has
a
robust
cocoa
sugar
taste
that
is
smooth
finishes
with
a
dry
slightly
bitter
after
taste
great
drinkability
and
well
made
a
great
beer
that
goes
down
well
with
some
charles
gayle
saxophone
that
is
inspired
by
coltrane
william
hookers
trio
cd
monsoon
would
also
be
a
nice
choice
for
this
american
style
porter
overall
pretty
darn
good
and
quite
sessionable
for
a
porter
complex
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
without
going
overboard
ill
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
this
one
overall
rating
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
an
extremely
good
porter
excellent
lacing
with
very
good
aromas
and
good
flavors
taste
roasted
bitterness
that
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
there
is
a
nice
aftertaste
that
only
stays
around
for
a
good
amount
of
time
have
had
from
tap
before
when
visiting
kc
but
this
one
was
from
a
bottle
pours
dark
amber
nearing
opaque
with
2
fingers
of
foam
that
dissipates
smooth
caramel
and
a
bit
of
roasted
coffee
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
solid
porter
from
boulevard
have
bought
multiple
times
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
and
although
not
as
popular
as
unfiltered
wheat
one
of
the
better
beers
that
they
make
overall
not
bad
for
the
style
i
will
probably
be
having
this
one
again
a
good
very
drinkable
porter
if
youre
looking
for
something
extreme
this
isnt
it
this
is
a
good
session
beer
packed
with
flavor
overall
a
very
good
porter
with
a
nice
hop
balance
appearance
is
dark
past
brown
with
a
nice
carmel
foam
smell
is
balanced
nicely
with
hops
and
grains
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
this
beer
leaves
the
mouth
nicely
taste
is
well
nicely
balanced
and
has
hits
of
toasting
overall
this
is
a
good
porter
that
will
go
well
with
any
meat
good
swiss
and
sausage
yea
overall
i
like
this
porter
but
its
not
my
favorite
a
nice
overall
job
by
the
boulevard
guys
a
well
crafted
porter
here
but
personally
i
like
a
little
more
sweetness
solid
choice
nonetheless
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbnation
and
a
slightly
roasted
malt
character
up
front
hints
of
toast
caramel
and
toffee
balanced
a
by
a
subtle
smokiness
as
well
as
some
autumnal
spice
slight
hop
bitterness
balances
things
lingering
into
a
dry
finish
o
it
has
some
good
things
going
for
it
but
not
something
ill
be
actively
grabbing
from
boulevards
offerings
appropriate
texture
and
mouthfeel
for
the
style
overall
a
solid
porter
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
tint
of
ruby
red
through
the
light
the
head
is
a
very
airy
creamy
pillow
of
frothy
bubbles
the
head
retention
is
nice
lots
of
lacing
not
as
sticky
as
other
beers
but
definitely
present
this
beer
smells
like
it
should
bitter
chocolates
roasted
malts
and
even
a
sweet
raisin
and
citrus
hop
presence
in
there
somewhere
a
nice
tasting
porter
with
the
bitter
chocolate
dominating
again
there
is
a
finish
of
tangy
hops
in
there
but
the
malty
bitter
chocolate
is
dominant
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
too
carbonated
overall
this
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
it
is
too
carbonated
like
some
boulevard
beers
tend
to
be
but
the
appearance
taste
and
aroma
are
all
worthy
it
has
its
flaws
but
i
like
this
porter
drink
i
love
me
some
blvd
always
a
quality
product
i
would
like
to
have
this
one
available
locally
quite
flavorful
but
clean
hops
are
subtle
nice
classic
porter
taste
more
like
an
english
porter
than
an
american
one
quite
good
overall
impression
an
awesome
brew
for
boulevard
roasty
and
the
characteristics
were
dead
on
to
be
a
robust
porter
enjoyed
greatly
and
hope
to
see
more
dont
see
this
much
in
6packs
with
the
other
boulevard
usuals
a
really
great
effort
will
drink
again
tastes
burnt
with
more
bittersweet
cocoa
at
the
finish
that
seems
to
sweeten
up
as
it
warms
theres
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
and
any
fans
of
porters
or
stouts
will
be
pleased
mouthfeeloverall
just
shy
of
medium
bodied
and
pretty
creamy
pretty
solid
in
this
category
overall
a
good
porter
generally
i
like
my
porters
more
rich
and
less
bitter
but
this
is
a
quality
brew
i
have
had
this
beer
quite
a
few
times
and
have
always
enjoyed
it
one
of
the
better
boulevard
regulars
for
sure
almost
done
with
this
variety
pack
this
offering
pours
a
clear
very
dark
russetrubybrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
very
steadfast
creamtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
molasses
maple
syrup
light
roasted
malts
light
cocoa
powder
a
tinge
of
coffee
and
a
dusting
of
florals
the
taste
accentuates
the
bitterness
of
these
elements
particularly
the
cocoa
the
coffee
and
the
roasted
malts
a
strong
sense
of
balsa
trickles
throughout
the
body
is
a
lightish
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
thin
feel
overall
a
solid
porter
but
one
that
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
thicker
and
sweeter
though
not
by
too
much
on
either
count
rjt
o
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
drinkable
porter
no
flavors
are
out
of
this
world
but
it
is
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
and
worth
a
try
pours
a
black
color
with
a
one
finger
mocha
head
that
retains
beautiful
lacing
throughout
aroma
of
roasty
malts
and
hops
taste
follows
the
nose
a
little
more
hoppy
than
the
typical
porter
and
thats
what
i
like
about
it
smooth
slightly
sweet
while
still
bitter
good
balance
but
it
doesnt
stifle
the
hop
profile
good
porter
overall
not
bad
a
nice
drinking
porter
with
some
darker
malts
full
bodied
bit
creamy
plenty
of
malts
in
there
hops
are
a
bit
harder
to
pull
out
and
the
very
slight
burnt
coffee
grind
acrid
and
acidic
like
flavor
takes
away
slightly
the
cpj
overall
i
must
say
that
this
beer
took
me
a
whole
six
pack
to
really
appreciate
but
ive
come
to
think
of
this
as
a
fine
porter
not
to
the
level
of
founders
porter
or
ed
fitz
but
few
are
definitely
worth
a
shot
notes
while
drinkable
and
enjoyable
not
memorable
would
not
pick
again
but
would
never
turn
one
down
rich
dark
black
color
and
no
light
shining
through
on
this
one
at
all
really
nice
head
of
tan
that
was
easily
a
couple
inches
high
at
first
slowly
settled
down
into
a
nice
pillow
that
laid
across
the
top
and
thoroughly
coated
the
inside
of
the
glass
rich
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
coffees
are
the
first
things
that
i
am
picking
up
in
the
aroma
really
nicely
done
with
hints
of
caramel
and
smoked
malts
there
is
almost
a
peat
like
smell
to
it
at
times
especially
as
it
warmed
up
equally
well
done
as
it
transfers
over
to
the
flavor
smooth
mellow
creamy
this
was
a
very
session
able
porter
rich
chocolate
notes
hints
of
smoked
malts
nice
touches
of
coffee
in
the
finish
which
left
a
slightly
dry
and
bitter
taste
as
it
rolls
away
across
the
tongue
very
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
overall
not
very
good
this
tastes
like
firstbatch
extract
homebrew
i
know
because
that
was
me
once
not
something
that
a
renowned
brewery
should
be
pumping
out
boulevard
has
failed
to
impress
me
with
this
12pack
why
are
their
specialty
beers
so
good
and
their
regular
lineup
so
weak
overall
im
not
feeling
this
beer
it
isnt
terrible
but
the
harshness
and
aroma
turn
me
off
for
a
porter
another
subpar
beer
from
boulevard
glad
im
not
paying
for
them
dvery
easy
drinking
yet
flavorful
porter
i
love
having
drinkable
porters
around
and
between
our
newfound
access
to
boulevard
and
central
waters
i
dont
think
ill
have
to
look
to
far
for
my
supply
of
them
bully
porter
from
boulevard
pour
with
a
big
frothy
head
into
my
tulip
glass
i
am
fearful
of
overprimation
the
appearance
as
stated
is
a
large
slightly
ecru
head
the
color
is
a
rich
dark
opaque
color
the
nose
is
not
what
i
was
hoping
again
could
be
an
effect
of
too
much
carbonation
i
do
smell
some
earthy
tones
however
a
good
strong
roastiness
finishes
on
the
buds
after
the
swallow
the
start
is
crisp
and
light
but
as
the
finish
comes
a
coffee
like
roasty
acidic
how
i
describe
a
regular
coffee
taste
taste
finishes
the
beer
it
is
quite
smooth
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
beer
average
porter
well
within
the
bestby
range
but
unsure
if
i
got
the
best
sample
reminds
me
of
the
underwhelming
sierra
nevada
porter
perhaps
im
spoiled
by
the
likes
of
founders
and
smuttynose
but
i
dont
see
myself
purchasing
or
seeking
this
out
again
even
if
it
was
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
overall
a
crowd
pleaser
true
to
form
and
well
done
o
a
good
take
on
the
porter
style
not
among
the
best
but
still
worth
a
try
solid
not
a
must
have
overall
this
is
a
great
straight
forward
porter
it
is
sweet
and
malty
and
has
a
great
kiss
of
roastiness
as
well
perfect
for
chilly
rainy
days
like
today
o
overall
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
for
such
a
moderate
abv
something
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
in
a
sitting
ill
check
this
one
out
again
welcome
to
chicago
boulevard
prosit
i
enjoyed
this
beer
easy
drinking
smooth
beer
it
complemented
my
tasty
cake
quite
nicely
overall
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
porter
with
a
sessionable
abv
and
has
a
very
reasonable
price
tag
of
7
99
a
sixer
drunkability
could
drink
this
in
the
morning
with
some
cocoa
puffs
or
on
them
d
while
i
like
this
as
a
change
from
the
run
of
the
mill
it
is
not
very
sessionable
imho
worth
a
try
and
i
would
try
again
o
pretty
good
above
average
american
porter
easy
drinking
this
porter
is
solid
in
all
categories
and
is
quite
easydrinking
flavors
mirror
the
aroma
but
combined
in
such
a
way
to
give
some
sharp
bitterness
just
here
and
there
the
carbonation
enhances
the
hops
and
dryness
full
bodied
this
is
a
nice
porter
and
quite
drinkable
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
american
porter
is
pitch
black
nice
carbonation
it
produces
a
nice
thick
tan
head
and
retention
is
good
there
is
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
chocolate
coffee
and
toasted
grain
the
taste
has
a
pleasant
malty
backbone
and
gives
way
to
burnt
grain
coffee
and
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
boulevard
very
drinkable
good
session
beer
and
a
slightly
above
average
american
porter
mouthfeel
is
light
as
well
as
the
carbonation
this
is
a
super
smooth
porter
its
almost
creamy
drinkablity
is
high
and
i
almost
wish
the
alcohol
was
lower
so
i
could
have
more
of
it
without
losing
my
ability
to
walk
all
in
all
this
is
a
really
solid
porter
high
in
flavor
and
super
drinkable
drinkability
is
also
good
due
to
good
carbonation
and
overall
balanced
taste
appeal
i
would
recommend
a
pint
but
considering
the
high
points
of
this
beer
the
aroma
and
appearance
i
wish
the
taste
had
a
little
more
to
offer
drinkability
some
of
the
great
flavors
i
smell
dont
come
through
in
taste
as
much
as
i
hoped
the
hops
takes
over
by
the
end
of
the
pint
just
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
like
out
of
this
style
a
good
porter
nonetheless
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
in

glass
a
foamy
tan
head
about
2
fingers
short
lasting
with
some
retention
not
much
aroma
pitch
black
color
very
roasted
taste
with
lots
of
flavor
and
bitterness
is
just
right
nice
creamy
texture
with
medium
body
and
some
lively
carbonation
great
finish
and
very
drinkable
another
very
good
boulevard
brew
great
beer
wonderful
medley
of
roasted
flavors
definitely
a
medium
body
beer
but
will
warm
you
up
and
coat
your
mouth
with
flavors
great
beer
boulevard
brewing
co
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
a
tan
head
and
good
lacing
you
cant
see
through
this
sucker
even
if
you
hold
it
up
to
a
light
smells
a
little
sweet
and
you
smell
a
little
coffee
and
some
roasted
malts
too
tastes
pretty
good
malts
are
roasted
but
it
isnt
an
overpowering
flavor
and
there
is
some
coffee
taste
too
i
dont
taste
any
hops
i
wish
it
was
a
little
creamier
and
less
dry
but
the
body
is
pretty
good
too
for
a
porter
i
think
its
very
drinkable
i
could
have
several
i
think
its
one
of
boulevards
better
offerings
d
i
would
have
to
rate
this
one
very
low
there
are
many
other
porters
that
work
better
for
me
i
like
bitter
beers
and
most
porters
but
the
combination
of
a
bitter
porter
misses
the
mark
for
me
boulevard
is
my
home
town
brewery
and
several
of
their
beers
are
among
my
most
loved
beers
this
one
not
so
much
from
notes
tasted
april
2010
d
really
disappointing
i
love
dark
beers
and
i
was
hoping
for
a
better
offering
from
boulevard
this
is
a
good
beer
12
ounce
bottle
pours
a
pretty
sizable
head
dissipates
a
little
with
time
but
some
head
sticks
around
throughout
not
much
of
a
smell
mouthfeel
is
fairly
carbonated
perhaps
a
little
too
much
it
is
surprisingly
light
on
the
tongue
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
too
viscous
good
chocolate
malt
flavor
with
a
long
finish
recommended
pairs
well
with
the
sonny
rollins
quintet
creamy
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
high
prickly
carbonation
the
high
carbonation
is
my
only
complaint
overallnotes
perhaps
not
as
enjoyable
as
the
sn
porter
the
only
other
ive
tasted
but
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
went
nicely
with
my
halfrack
of
ribs
honestly
ive
never
attempted
to
pair
beer
with
food
but
theres
a
first
for
everything
good
times
really
d
the
higher
carbonation
is
annoying
now
halfway
through
the
glass
the
taste
was
simple
but
good
for
overall
drinkability
it
is
just
above
average
it
is
bottle
conditioned
so
i
will
let
a
couple
cellar
for
while
and
see
what
happens
ah
ive
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
very
tasty
wellcrafted
smooth
enough
to
drink
quickly
with
enough
hops
carbonation
to
keep
it
interesting
all
the
while
this
is
my
favorite
of
boulevards
staple
lineup
boulevard
beers
are
usually
nicely
priced
so
that
helps
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
head
is
foamy
but
doesnt
leave
too
much
lacing
smell
is
roasty
with
some
faint
chocolate
notes
taste
is
roasted
malts
with
some
surprising
fruity
notes
some
nice
smokey
and
chocolaty
notes
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
as
far
as
body
goes
very
drinkable
beer
i
was
sad
there
were
only
2
in
the
mix
pack
i
bought
d
this
beer
looks
and
tastes
great
its
only
when
you
get
nit
picky
about
it
do
you
find
the
flaws
bravo
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
porter
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
deep
dark
opaque
black
with
a
tan
head
the
dissipated
to
crown
and
left
minimal
lacing
smell
very
bitter
with
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
bitter
with
the
coffee
leading
the
way
feel
is
crisp
with
a
full
body
and
a
pretty
clean
finish
overall
a
good
porter
i
do
love
a
good
american
porter
and
this
is
such
a
thing
modest
but
not
bland
this
beer
is
well
assembled
which
seems
to
be
the
case
with
most
of
boulevards
year
round
beers
drinkability
very
nice
easily
drinkable
for
a
porter
could
be
a
bit
heavy
after
going
through
two
of
these
but
for
its
style
its
a
winner
bravo
boulevard
overall
a
solid
beer
ive
had
it
on
two
previous
occasions
and
really
disliked
it
both
times
obviously
the
food
i
was
eating
masked
and
distorted
this
beer
it
definitely
tastes
above
average
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
someone
looking
for
a
solid
porter
or
someone
getting
ready
to
step
up
to
porters
since
its
a
good
example
of
a
gateway
beer
unfortunately
i
have
another
9
beers
to
go
before
its
rid
of
my
refridgerator
what
a
brew
huge
flavor
yet
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
are
a
bit
more
robust
than
most
porters
i
have
tried
but
i
can
appreciate
the
change
for
dark
beer
lovers
this
is
a
must
try
drinkability
overall
a
more
than
solid
example
of
the
style
even
if
nothing
truly
stands
out
and
grabs
your
attention
quite
drinkable
all
things
considered
flavorful
but
not
over
the
top
not
my
favorite
take
on
a
porter
but
certainly
not
a
bad
one
fd
i
might
have
killed
off
too
much
of
the
carbonation
still
good
though
light
on
the
tongue
slick
but
not
overly
coating
good
stuff
indeed
taste
is
quite
good
very
smooth
body
and
mouthfeel
has
almost
a
crispness
to
it
and
not
heavy
at
all
roast
character
is
there
but
avoids
the
coffee
flavor
that
i
am
sensitive
to
in
these
types
of
beers
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
which
is
fine
gives
a
nice
sharp
bitterness
that
lingers
but
in
a
good
way
i
dont
drink
many
porters
but
this
was
definitely
a
nice
one
to
sample
to
break
up
the
pale
ale
and
ipa
monotony
would
definitely
recommend
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
solid
looking
head
smells
and
taste
are
both
dominated
by
dark
roasted
malt
some
coffee
flavors
a
little
bitter
chocolate
thick
body
fairly
carbonated
typical
of
most
boulevard
beers
chewy
mouthfeel
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
good
and
very
drinkable
porter
no
off
notes
or
weird
flavors
just
a
straightforward
and
delicious
beer
if
you
can
get
this
beer
consider
yourself
lucky
a
tasty
porter
indeed
definitely
goes
down
easy
and
could
be
sessionable
fairly
flavourful
if
not
all
that
complex
not
too
bad
a
porter
bully
pours
a
deep
chocolate
color
with
a
very
frothy
2
finger
head
and
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
burnt
coffee
some
choco
and
smoke
pretty
good
smelling
brew
but
not
overpowering
in
any
way
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
a
meaty
finish
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
d
quite
drinkable
for
a
porter
overall
really
pleasant
i
will
definitely
come
back
for
more
drinkability
just
a
solid
allround
beer
a
pretty
faithful
emulation
of
a
classic
english
porter
sixers
of
this
arent
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
but
if
they
were
i
would
definitely
put
bully
in
the
rotation
id
been
hearing
about
boulevard
for
years
so
i
was
quite
excited
when
their
beers
finally
made
it
out
to
denver
pours
nearly
black
very
inviting
with
a
dense
tan
head
nice
aromas
of
roasted
malt
sweet
chocolate
and
freshly
roasted
coffee
taking
a
sip
i
am
immediately
in
love
with
this
beer
great
smoky
chocolately
flavors
with
some
nice
roastiness
on
the
finish
a
really
really
good
porter
very
drinkable
at
7
99
a
sixer
dthis
was
one
of
the
first
porters
that
i
tried
helping
to
catapult
me
into
tasty
beerdom
specifically
into
the
world
of
black
beers
this
beer
certainly
has
held
its
spot
in
my
heart
with
its
good
flavor
and
easy
drinking
this
is
very
enjoyable
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
highly
drinkable
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
lasts
well
the
aroma
is
that
of
roasted
malt
and
trace
of
sweetness
the
taste
has
a
roasted
flavor
with
some
sweetness
and
a
bitter
finish
it
has
a
creamy
body
and
goes
down
smooth
with
just
a
very
slight
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
respectable
porter
nothing
fancy
d
this
is
a
great
beer
to
kick
back
with
and
enjoy
a
few
only
problem
boulevard
puts
out
to
many
good
beers
to
settle
on
1
to
drink
what
a
problem
to
have
d
i
could
drink
these
all
night
seriously
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
beers
the
abv
is
light
and
allows
you
to
enjoy
this
one
without
keeling
over
very
drinkable
coupled
with
the
robust
flavor
and
sessionable
abv
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
nice
drinking
and
good
tasting
porter
it
has
a
good
balance
of
flavors
coming
from
the
chocolaty
sweetness
the
roasted
bitterness
and
the
earthy
hops
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
nose
has
roasty
malts
chocolate
and
floral
hops
taste
has
more
of
the
same
a
bit
bland
and
quite
one
dimensional
thin
body
is
overly
carbonated
a
good
session
beer
to
wash
down
a
burger
i
suppose
but
there
are
so
many
better
examples
drinkability
is
also
good
this
is
a
solid
porter
flavorful
but
not
to
heavy
very
sessionable
and
well
worth
trying
a
solid
substantial
drink
not
spectacular
but
solid
a
dark
brown
color
is
poured
in
the
glass
with
hints
of
red
peaking
through
as
the
beer
settles
in
the
glass
a
beige
half
inch
head
forms
that
slowly
laces
down
the
glass
a
strong
chocolate
scent
comes
out
at
the
front
of
the
aroma
then
blending
to
a
dark
bread
and
floral
fragrance
malty
sweetness
strikes
out
at
first
taste
followed
by
the
dominating
flavors
of
coffee
and
chocolate
it
finishes
with
a
grassy
and
citric
bitterness
that
stays
on
the
palate
long
after
each
taste
is
gone
a
medium
feel
at
the
front
that
gradually
gains
weight
as
it
rolls
across
the
palate
it
all
ends
with
a
slick
finish
a
very
good
porter
with
a
dark
and
rich
look
a
fragrant
aroma
which
is
strengthened
by
the
solid
taste
the
slick
finish
just
makes
you
glad
to
be
drink
this
beer
overall
nice
readily
available
sessiontype
porter
with
good
balance
and
moderate
fullness
notes
good
example
of
a
porter
and
one
of
the
better
beers
from
boulevards
normal
series
well
balanced
even
my
friends
who
are
more
macro
drinkers
enjoyed
this
d
this
is
a
good
quality
porter
probably
right
up
there
with
edmund
fitz
as
my
favorite
classic
porter
great
flavor
and
very
drinkable
dark
malts
contribute
notes
of
espresso
and
cocoa
with
a
burnt
edge
and
fight
it
out
with
a
biggerthanexpected
herbal
leafy
hop
character
surprisingly
the
hops
edge
out
the
malt
making
this
a
rather
unique
porter
a
solid
flavorful
porter
that
lacks
a
bit
of
depth
in
the
malt
department
it
tasted
much
the
same
it
feels
like
a
watered
down
version
of
their
dry
stout
only
with
the
same
thickness
still
pretty
drinkable
and
has
a
good
mouthfeel
rather
average
in
all
other
aspects
perhaps
they
should
revisit
the
recipe
used
for
this
beer
spend
some
time
in
england
for
a
change
would
i
buy
more
of
it
definitely
ill
be
in
kansas
city
in
may
and
ill
be
paying
a
visit
to
the
brewpub
for
a
pint
or
two
d
goes
down
easy
decently
balanced
nice
beer
that
i
could
sit
with
for
a
pint
or
two
d
nice
appearance
and
flavor
i
just
wish
the
nose
was
a
bit
stronger
d
extremely
drinkableactually
downright
chuggable
one
of
the
most
easy
going
and
tasty
readily
available
porters
ive
had
d
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
flavored
and
goes
down
easy
d
very
easy
drinking
with
a
pretty
darn
good
taste
nothing
amazing
but
still
really
good
nice
dark
chocolate
body
with
a
towering
caramel
head
almost
earned
the
nest
highest
score
nice
sheets
of
lace
are
left
in
the
snifter
when
the
cap
clears
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
with
sweet
chocolate
notes
in
the
forefront
after
one
sip
i
can
tell
this
porter
is
well
balanced
with
a
nice
roasted
flavor
to
match
up
to
the
sweet
chocolate
flavor
not
bitter
but
sweet
and
savory
like
a
brownie
lots
of
milk
chocolate
flavor
and
cookie
mouthfeel
is
moderately
heavy
and
glides
silkily
across
the
mouth
with
ease
a
great
session
porter
and
my
favorite
session
beer
from
them
thus
far
definitely
a
darker
feeling
porter
here
but
thats
just
the
way
i
like
them
this
was
very
rich
with
roast
coffee
and
bitterness
but
there
was
more
than
enough
sticky
sweetness
to
keep
this
balanced
and
very
drinkable
this
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
a
nicely
done
porter
here
from
boulevard
drinkability
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
but
the
best
is
inside
boulevards
bottles
this
one
i
poured
into
a
samuel
smith
pint
glass
and
wow
what
a
gorgeous
head
that
doesnt
die
smell
deep
richness
taste
bitter
but
very
good
mouthful
well
blended
porter
and
drinkability
could
drink
several
in
one
sitting
are
equally
exceptional
too
not
quite
the
best
porter
ive
ever
had
those
honors
for
me
go
to
founders
porter
great
lakes
edmund
fitgerald
upland
bad
elmer
bells
porter
but
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
and
look
forward
to
trying
other
boulevard
brews
d
a
well
crafted
porter
id
drink
another
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
tasty
brew
that
goes
down
easily
the
pour
of
bully
imagine
someone
yelling
that
every
time
you
read
it
yielded
a
decent
one
fingers
worth
of
head
the
beers
is
very
dark
like
a
porter
should
be
all
are
and
the
head
has
a
caramel
color
characteristic
to
it
the
head
stayed
around
for
a
couple
of
minutes
and
laced
the
glass
bully
has
a
roasted
smell
a
sort
of
coffee
characteristic
taking
a
sip
of
this
i
wonder
how
it
would
taste
with
bbq
probably
awesome
if
not
the
bbq
would
be
awesome
if
youre
in
kc
the
roasted
scent
of
the
beer
is
present
in
the
flavor
roasted
malts
and
a
little
hops
the
coffee
flavor
is
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
i
felt
was
lacking
sadly
bully
drank
a
little
watery
not
flavor
wise
but
more
so
it
wasnt
as
thick
as
id
like
it
to
be
because
of
this
it
becomes
very
drinkable
for
a
porter
but
what
i
like
about
porters
is
the
thickness
of
them
i
was
a
little
saddened
by
that
but
its
still
a
solid
porter
and
one
that
i
will
purchase
as
long
as
its
made
notes
this
was
one
of
the
first
porters
i
liked
a
lot
after
a
long
absence
i
find
it
certainly
still
holds
its
own
it
actually
tastes
more
robust
than
i
remember
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
porter
this
is
relatively
fresh
and
is
very
tasty
however
there
are
other
porters
id
rather
drink
on
a
regular
basis
still
a
great
porter
and
one
that
i
will
keep
a
few
bottles
on
hand
d
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
porter
d
its
hard
to
get
over
the
mouthfeel
which
doesnt
live
up
to
the
otherwise
fine
beer
it
really
does
make
it
less
enjoyable
to
drink
with
a
little
more
balance
and
refinement
this
could
have
been
a
great
beer
but
as
it
stands
its
simply
adequate
for
boulevard
notes
a
solid
albeit
very
roasted
porter
i
like
this
style
of
porter
but
i
know
others
prefer
a
lighter
and
less
bitter
version
a
great
new
american
style
md
what
a
great
intro
to
another
new
brewery
thanks
to
springdogg
a
smooth
complex
porter
that
is
super
easy
to
drink
and
silky
smooth
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
well
brewed
makes
me
anxious
to
dive
into
those
sixth
glass
bottles
he
sent
me
this
one
had
good
flavors
the
body
seemed
a
bit
to
be
desired
nonetheless
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
worth
a
try
i
am
now
anxious
to
try
the
rest
of
the
sampler
all
at
once
12
oz
bottle
pours
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
fizzy
light
brown
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
mainly
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
coffee
and
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
about
the
same
sweet
a
big
amount
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
some
spicy
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
fairly
carbonated
good
dry
and
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
beer
tasty
porter
drinkability
is
decent
a
standard
porter
that
could
use
a
bit
of
smoothing
out
and
has
a
decent
mix
of
flavors
that
falls
short
of
anything
to
get
excited
about
d
i
am
a
big
fan
of
porters
becasue
of
the
huge
flavors
without
the
high
abv
i
would
love
to
find
some
boulavard
products
on
tap
and
in
12
packs
in
my
texas
region
this
is
a
tasty
porter
love
the
raw
earthy
complexity
of
all
the
malts
it
leans
towards
a
deeper
more
bitter
flavor
tone
but
everything
works
out
well
great
offering
from
boulevard
medium
body
starts
smooth
but
quite
astringent
and
acidic
at
times
further
accentuated
by
the
otherwise
fluffy
moderate
carbonation
bear
with
me
on
this
one
kids
this
is
my
first
review
so
dont
be
too
harsh
dont
have
all
the
bear
snob
terms
down
even
though
i
would
say
i
am
one
insert
silly
emoticon
here
overall
a
very
good
porter
robust
but
every
drinkable
with
a
depth
of
character
boulevard
makes
some
good
solid
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
has
a
nice
looking
deep
black
color
to
it
with
a
big
foamy
off
white
head
with
a
real
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
smell
is
of
rich
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
to
it
taste
is
pretty
good
too
the
malt
is
very
dominate
as
well
as
the
chocolately
flavors
no
hop
flavor
at
all
but
none
is
to
be
expected
really
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
a
very
good
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
if
it
were
winter
im
sure
it
wold
be
better
but
its
85
degreees
out
right
now
d
not
really
restrictive
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
think
with
dinner
this
could
be
a
good
one
to
pair
with
burgers
and
steaks
although
why
since
there
are
so
many
other
beers
out
there
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
however
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
porter
fans
theres
not
really
any
better
way
to
put
it
besides
i
just
want
more
out
of
my
beer
especially
porters
one
of
the
most
complex
mixture
of
flavors
in
a
low
abv
porter
very
good
job
boulevard
allinall
a
very
easy
and
smooth
porter
to
drink
which
i
could
session
with
if
i
wanted
to
do
that
with
a
porter
dark
black
in
color
with
thick
mocha
foam
head
roasted
grains
and
malt
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
heavy
with
roasted
tones
and
a
good
bed
of
malt
that
follows
the
initial
presentation
by
smoothing
out
into
a
caramel
type
of
sensation
in
the
middle
of
the
flavor
the
finish
is
heavy
with
roasted
grains
and
malt
the
flavors
resonate
in
your
mouth
for
an
aftertaste
that
is
consistent
with
the
flavor
just
okay
for
me
it
seems
big
compared
to
most
of
boulevards
mainline
beers
hv
d
two
beers
with
a
red
meat
meal
or
some
bbq
is
perfect
or
one
as
an
after
meal
snack
id
have
preferred
this
porter
accentuate
the
malts
more
as
opposed
to
going
to
the
hops
personal
preferance
i
suppose
but
it
is
also
what
i
expect
for
style
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
really
my
cup
of
tea
err
beer
d
another
good
beer
from
boulevard
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
porters
the
roasted
flavor
really
dominates
this
ale
making
it
a
porter
than
would
probably
compliment
a
meal
rather
than
being
a
stand
alone
beer
thanks
cosmohophead
drinkability
that
got
better
and
better
throughout
the
session
i
could
definitely
go
for
another
bottle
if
only
i
had
one
i
wonder
how
much
that
best
by
date
affected
the
beer
id
really
like
to
try
this
one
again
overall
alot
more
hops
then
most
porters
ive
tried
a
really
good
session
porter
that
borders
being
a
dry
stout
pretty
good
session
beer
low
abv
and
a
helluva
lot
of
flavor
this
is
one
not
to
miss
this
is
interesting
because
it
is
more
brown
than
black
and
kind
of
light
in
color
compared
to
what
i
usually
expect
from
a
porter
great
head
but
it
smells
a
lot
more
like
a
brown
ale
and
the
taste
follows
suit
this
is
a
fine
enough
beer
but
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
porter
except
for
the
slightest
bit
of
coffee
flavor
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
nice
frothy
cappuccino
like
head
rings
of
stickage
all
over
the
place
roasted
malts
bakers
chocolate
and
light
roasted
coffee
much
the
same
with
flavors
with
a
nice
chocolate
mocha
fade
roasted
coffee
and
nuttiness
linger
on
in
the
finish
as
well
creamy
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
effortless
drinker
here
and
a
session
porter
for
sure
nice
american
porter
d
this
is
a
decent
enough
little
porter
i
started
out
liking
it
a
lot
but
as
it
warmed
i
become
less
thrilled
because
of
the
increase
in
acidity
still
a
decent
beer
overall
d
this
is
a
sessionable
porter
not
bad
d
pretty
good
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
had
best
by
date
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
poured
a
really
dark
brown
with
dark
red
around
the
edges
with
a
big
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
has
small
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
not
to
much
of
a
strong
smell
going
on
the
taste
is
very
similar
though
the
coffee
sticks
out
a
lot
more
in
the
taste
goes
down
really
smooth
and
goes
by
pretty
quickly
drinkable
for
sure
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
ive
had
from
boulevard
yet
poured
into
a
pint
glass
black
with
a
tan
one
finger
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
but
its
not
all
that
strong
the
first
taste
has
a
hint
of
smoked
flavor
not
much
malted
sweetness
really
theres
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
at
the
end
of
the
pallate
that
is
actually
too
much
i
think
not
very
well
balanced
id
like
more
smoke
malted
flavor
to
catch
up
to
the
hops
the
carbonation
is
also
a
little
high
for
a
porter
this
is
a
ok
session
porter
but
thats
about
it
a
nice
session
porter
this
is
a
decent
porter
that
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
not
too
bad
poured
with
a
tan
head
and
brown
highlights
no
lace
very
dark
mahogoney
color
aroma
is
malty
roasty
with
some
dark
ripe
fruit
flavor
is
very
similar
seems
force
carbonated
some
booziness
to
it
good
finish
could
be
a
session
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
maybe
just
a
touch
higher
on
the
hops
than
i
like
which
is
about
the
only
fault
i
can
find
with
it
definitely
a
very
tasty
beer
one
worth
checking
out
d
so
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
i
love
a
good
porter
on
a
hot
afternoon
roasty
and
warm
for
the
winter
yet
crisp
and
refreshing
for
my
hot
afternoons
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
deep
ruby
brown
color
one
finger
caramel
colored
head
smell
is
fruity
yeasty
slightly
floral
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
tastes
like
bitter
roasted
malts
slight
hints
of
chocolate
lots
of
sweet
malt
very
faint
metallic
twang
heavy
carbonation
thin
body
not
bad
overall
very
drinkable
the
chocolate
tones
are
nice
perhaps
a
bit
too
fruity
notes
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
annoying
to
me
and
i
would
like
it
to
be
a
bit
thicker
but
the
taste
is
excellent
overall
one
of
the
better
basic
american
porters
boulevard
does
a
nice
job
on
just
about
everything
they
make
and
bully
porter
is
no
exception
it
has
a
deep
brown
color
and
the
aroma
made
me
think
it
was
going
to
be
sweet
but
it
was
not
it
had
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
a
slight
chocolate
flavor
or
maybe
that
was
more
of
the
aroma
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
a
uniformly
good
porter
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
apart
from
the
appearance
but
nothing
about
it
is
subgood
either
at
5
2
and
reasonably
tasty
its
perfectly
sessionable
as
well
good
for
you
boulevard
d
drinks
pretty
easy
and
is
pretty
damn
tasty
especially
for
such
low
alcohol
not
as
good
as
ed
fitz
or
founders
but
id
definitely
order
one
at
the
bar
overall
this
is
one
exceptional
brew
this
will
probably
be
my
go
to
porter
from
now
on
really
robust
flavors
in
this
one
without
anything
being
to
dominating
nice
look
forward
to
more
of
these
glad
i
went
with
the
6pk
d
a
solid
porter
that
went
down
easy
im
not
a
huge
porter
drinker
but
i
would
consider
keeping
some
of
this
around
for
when
a
meal
calls
for
one
or
during
winter
time
d
not
the
smoothest
of
beers
but
still
enjoyable
great
smell
and
the
coffee
flavors
with
the
hops
are
pleasant
not
bad
of
a
porter
thanks
boulevard
for
making
an
every
day
porter
that
is
fantastic
all
of
the
time
this
is
what
i
go
to
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
after
a
hard
days
work
instead
of
one
of
those
woosie
macro
light
no
taste
lager
beers
great
stuff
pours
a
very
light
ruby
in
color
but
does
appear
brown
in
the
glass
quickly
diminishing
white
cream
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
seems
to
be
a
really
basic
stale
example
nose
shows
a
hint
of
sour
fruit
flavor
is
really
lacking
thin
lacking
concentration
hmmm
dm
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
bubbles
unfortunately
the
bad
taste
doesnt
allow
you
to
enjoy
the
smooth
feel
the
only
way
to
drink
it
is
to
chug
and
a
fairly
pricey
microbrew
should
be
appreciated
comfortably
boulevard
doesnt
make
many
styles
that
i
particularly
like
bully
porter
and
unfiltered
wheat
being
the
exceptions
but
theyve
really
hit
a
home
run
with
this
one
if
you
like
porter
try
this
one
if
youve
never
tried
porter
this
is
as
good
of
a
place
to
start
as
any
bully
porter
is
always
welcome
in
my
beer
fridge
d
nicely
balanced
beer
makes
this
very
drinkable
hides
the
abv
and
body
well
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
bodied
porter
with
a
nice
gentle
carbonation
overall
pretty
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
make
a
night
out
of
still
a
decent
porter
overall
a
good
sugary
porter
that
stands
out
amongst
the
roasty
charcoal
brews
the
flavor
muddle
at
the
end
killed
it
for
me
though
pours
a
dark
black
color
54
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
up
front
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
and
slight
chocolate
fits
the
style
of
american
porter
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
thick
with
a
high
carbonation
level
present
tastes
of
roasted
malt
hops
slight
sweet
malt
and
overall
a
fairly
bitter
beer
pours
a
dark
red
colored

with
a
big
foamy

head
good
lasting
malty
nutty
coffee

dark

somewhat
dry
d
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
the
beer
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
probably
my
favorite
ap
overall
nice
porter
overall
with
nice
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
this
is
hands
down
the
most
balanced
drinkable
porter
ive
come
across
thus
far
and
is
easily
the
best
among
boulevards
yearround
brews
certainly
hoppier
than
a
lot
of
porters
but
i
admire
the
originality
this
should
be
a
staple
in
bars
across
the
midwest
nose
of
delicious
roastycoffeechocolate
goodness
i
can
almost
taste
the
beer
with
a
few
big
sniffs
and
its
making
my
mouth
water
on
first
sip
this
starts
quite
different
than
the
aroma
with
a
burnt
malt
flavor
dominating
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
bitterness
comes
toward
the
end
with
a
bit
of
earthy
hop
bitterness
to
finish
it
off
good
mediumbodied
chewiness
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
leaves
the
entire
inside
of
my
mouth
feeling
coated
but
slightly
dry
a
solid
porter
gave
it
some
more
time
to
achieve
room
temp
and
the
flavor
turned
sweet
and
i
could
more
easily
detect
some
of
the
nutty
and
roasted
porter
characteristics
overall
this
wasnt
my
favorite
porter
it
seemd
to
be
to
smokey
it
came
in
the
sample
pack
so
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
dark
brown
with
hint
of
red
and
a
tan
head
lacing
remains
for
most
of
the
glass
not
very
aromatic
but
smells
of
roasted
chocolate
are
there
the
taste
is
a
nice
roasted
and
grainy
malt
that
finishes
bitter
this
is
a
great
goto
inexpensive
porter
that
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
beautiful
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
bubbly
off
white
head
sticks
around
forever
and
sticks
to
the
entire
glass
smells
of
grainy
malts
dark
chocolate
and
roast
tastes
of
chocolate
and
roast
a
bit
of
nut
and
faint
fruit
in
the
finish
lingering
roast
bitterness
on
the
pallete
long
after
each
sip
medium
to
high
carbonation
medium
body
creamy
silky
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
porter
lower
the
carbonation
a
bit
and
it
would
be
outstanding
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
red
almost
black
color
with
over
two
fingers
of
frothy
tan
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
for
over
five
minutes
smell
is
like
roasted
cocoa
and
burnt
chocolate
taste
is
very
roasty
and
chocolatey
goes
down
very
smooth
light
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
as
its
light
and
goes
down
so
easy
i
regret
ive
passed
over
this
beer
so
many
times
before
as
it
is
the
best
porter
ive
had
yet
boulevard
never
lets
me
down
reddish
cola
brownmostly
opaque
with
a
huge
rocky
light
tan
head
retains
nicely
treerings
of
lacing
down
my
glass
smells
of
tart
cherries
mild
sweetness
and
smoky
roastyburnt
malts
really
smooth
strong
nutty
flavor
up
from
akin
to
a
good
brown
ale
dark
fruits
slightly
tart
and
sweet
brighten
up
in
the
middle
and
the
finish
is
very
smooth
with
deep
roasty
malt
not
very
heavy
at
all
in
the
body
but
has
that
frothy
character
from
the
nice
retaining
head
exactly
as
a
porter
should
feel
this
is
a
really
nice
porter
i
could
drink
lots
of
these
and
plan
to
in
the
future
i
have
never
tried
a
porter
before
this
one
and
i
think
i
found
an
all
right
starting
point
as
a
newcomer
to
this
style
or
perhaps
even
a
keep
it
in
stock
beer
esp
in
the
winter
pu
ssshsht
yes
i
did
just
open
another
thank
you
i
will
have
another
d
drinkability
does
not
get
much
higher
in
a
porter
than
this
refreshing
compared
to
other
porters
ive
had
the
reason
this
beers
drinkability
is
where
it
is
is
because
of
the
taste
its
not
that
you
could
slam
beer
after
beer
but
you
really
want
to
keep
drinking
it
its
that
good
i
tore
through
half
of
this
beer
without
even
noticing
so
drinkability
is
pretty
good
d
this
is
a
great
beer
that
is
well
balanced
and
could
easily
be
sessioned
dtempting
aftertaste
low
alcohol
taste
pulled
out
of
a
variety
case
poured
pitch
black
with
a
tan
head
and
lacing
this
beer
reminds
me
slightly
of
rogues
shakespeare
stout
but
in
porterform
the
malts
are
very
very
smooth
with
dark
roasted
barley
with
cocoa
powder
and
dark
rich
chocolate
theres
also
spicy
hops
in
the
background
that
grow
as
the
beer
warms
drinkable
and
very
tasty
check
this
baby
out
i
havent
had
one
of
these
in
about
a
month
and
it
tastes
just
as
refreshing
as
i
could
have
hoped
for
this
is
one
of
my
absolute
goto
beers
it
is
widely
available
where
i
live
and
it
is
very
very
good
i
generally
always
have
some
in
my
fridge
for
good
reason
this
is
boulevards
finest
yearround
beer
imo
this
is
a
fine
beer
to
celebrate
the
holidays
with
merry
christmas
d
great
example
of
a
porter
all
around
great
drinkability
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
ashen
dark
brown
with
a
big
rocky
beige
head
that
melts
into
a
thin
rim
around
the
circumference
of
the
glass
leaving
no
lacing
but
some
serious
legs
the
aroma
is
roasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
and
just
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
huge
wallop
of
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
chocolate
a
hint
of
sweet
cream
and
just
a
touch
of
magic
the
mouthfeel
is
especially
full
for
a
porter
its
much
more
stout
like
then
what
i
consider
a
typical
mouthfeel
for
a
porter
this
in
my
humble
opinion
is
the
best
year
round
offering
from
my
local
backyard
brewery
notes
from
1607
notes
this
is
my
go
to
beer
i
almost
always
have
at
least
2
bottles
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
this
is
a
nice
porter
for
the
most
part
its
body
is
a
dark
opaque
with
a
head
and
lace
that
are
offwhite
but
i
would
say
almost
tan
there
is
plenty
of
head
and
lace
the
flavor
has
a
little
more
hop
flavor
than
most
porters
but
it
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
it
has
a
very
robust
caramel
roasted
malt
taste
there
are
some
chocolate
coffee
tones
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
not
bad
pretty
much
everything
you
want
in
a
good
porter
this
is
an
old
favorite
of
mine
that
has
finally
worked
its
way
into
houston
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
the
only
problem
i
had
was
the
hops
was
a
bit
to
powerful
and
made
the
beer
unbalanced
it
was
an
okay
porter
but
not
my
favorite
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
4232009
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
red
tints
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
spice
and
hops
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
roastedburnt
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
smoke
theres
also
a
lingering
earthy
hop
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
also
but
has
too
much
carbonation
for
me
or
at
least
more
carbonation
than
i
like
in
my
porters
drinkability
is
good
but
would
be
better
if
the
carbonation
was
lower
overall
i
like
this
beer
id
try
it
again
in
the
future
easy
drinking
and
smooth
solid
d
solid
porter
with
a
touch
of
astringeny
but
i
could
easily
have
a
few
in
a
row
d
it
was
a
well
balanced
porter
with
distinct
flavors
and
a
pleasant
aroma
for
those
that
enjoy
a
porter
it
could
be
a
strong
contender
for
a
session
beer
wow
thats
one
foamy
beer
had
to
pour
it
in
two
hits
after
letting
the
initial
head
subside
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
interesting
slightly
breadyyeasty
with
hints
of
the
dried
fruit
that
my
mother
used
to
keep
in
tins
in
the
pantry
and
which
id
sneak
into
when
she
was
engrossed
in
coronation
street
nice
bitterness
in
the
flavour
tempered
with
a
faint
sweetness
plenty
of
roasted
flavours
in
the
finish
earthy
nice
body
very
nice
in
fact
quite
delicious
d
not
quite
the
smooth
and
drinkable
porter
but
definitely
chock
full
of
flavor
a
good
one
to
end
the
evening
on
a
roasted
and
bitter
porter
that
will
linger
tasty
and
worth
seeking
out
d
a
nice
beer
d
i
didnt
think
i
liked
porters
or
that
there
was
much
variation
to
the
style
until
i
had
this
im
rather
impressed
a
great
dark
malty
beer
i
fried
up
an
egg
in
olive
oil
on
a
toasted
english
muffin
with
salt
pepper
and
crumbled
blue
cheese
and
sank
back
into
the
chair
a
bite
and
a
sip
a
bite
and
a
sip
pure
bliss
wonderful
stuff
nuff
said
d
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
porter
not
too
heavy
and
priced
for
session
drinking
d
pretty
good
porter
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
complex
or
overpowering
either
probably
the
best
boulevard

with
hops
bittering
much
more
pronounced
in
the

and
lightly
lingering
at
the

mouthfeel
was
a
little
lighter
than
anticipated
for
the
style
but
not
far
off
and
slightly
overcarbonated
good
drinkability
but
less
carbonation
definitely
would
have
enhanced
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
in
my
opinion
md
medium
to
full
bodied
and
excellent
feel
by
american
porter
standards
very
drinkable

felt
a
touch
thin
but
its
still
good
stuff
thanks
russ
very
good
beer
balanced
and
slightly
complex
wouldnt
define
as
a
sessionable
beer
because
of
the
complexities
deserves
to
be
sipped
in
enjoyment
pours
a
nice
dark
coffee
color
out
of
the
bottle
with

fizzy
chocolatemilk
colored
head
it
has

strong
chocolate
smell
with
some

taste
is
light
on
the
roast
and
has
a
nice
sweetness
with
some
bitter
tones
it
has
a
little
thickness
too
it
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
for
the
price
this
is
a
fantastic
porter
d
an
exceptional
porter
with
just
the
right
mix
of
toasted
and
chocolate
malt
flavors
and
mild

pleasantly
upon

this
is
my
favorite
offering
from
boulevard
drinkability
in
short
an
excellent
porter
well
contructed
with
ample
body
dry
and
delicious
not
bad
porter
is
not
my
favorite
but
this
is
worth
the
try
if
you
love
this
style
solid
gald
i
got
it
in
a
sampler
probably
wouldnt
get
a
pint
or
sixer
though
im
slowly
but
surely
discovering
a
world
of
good
porters
out
there
d
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
bought
at
specs
came
in
the
boulevard
sampler
12
pack
smells
of
tar
and
slightly
like
starbucks
espresso
has
a
great
mouthfeel
nice
and
roasty
lowmedium

a
very
nice
and
well
made

very

this
is
bold
enough
to
stand
up
to
other
beers
while
being
people
friendly
by
far
the
best
ive
had
from
boulevard
brewing
this
beer
can
be
found
everywhere
in
the
midwest
so
its
good
that
they
make
at
least
one
great
brew
almost
four
fingers
of
fluffy
nouget
brown
head
almost
creeps
over
the
rim
of
the
glass
excellent
head
retention
leaving
scattered
lace
body
settles
to
true
blackness
with
slight
brown
notes
on
the
edges
mineral
based
malt
on
the
nose
teams
with
sweet
smokey
notes
for
nice
balance
a
bit
of
zesty
smoke
enters
the
mouth
with
toasty
malt
on
first
sip
some
bakers
chocolate
also
rests
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
slight
soured
dark
furit
feel
is
also
there
at
the
end
of
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
bitter
rich
very
approachable
and
drinkable
beer
pours
a
real
dark
hue
with
a
nice
tannish
head
that
falls
fairly
quickly
some
minor
coffee
in
there
on
the
nose
flavor
has
a
decent
sweet
smooth
tone
to
it
minor
coffee
is
noticeable
on
the
back
side
as
it
warms
up
there
seems
to
be
a
slight
touch
of
caramel
and
slightly
more
vanilla
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
the
carbonation
has
a
slight
bite
but
not
very
much
really
this
is
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
porter
di
have
this
all
the
time
really
suprising
i
had
not
reviewed
it
yet
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
the
standard
black
that
i
was
expecting
plus
a
nice
tan
head
smelled
of
chocolate
malt
and
some
hoppiness
but
i
was
surprised
by
this
brew
as
is
tasted
a
little
too
much
like
a
stout
for
me
it
lacked
the
sweetness
i
was
looking
for
and
instead
gave
me
a
powerful
kick
of
roasted
malts
while
the
hops
gave
it
a
nice
balance
it
just
tasted
a
little
too
thin
in
addition
to
being
more
like
a
stout
at
least
to
my
palate
d
pretty
good
finisher
im
finished
im
ashamed
ive
not
reviewed
this
before
its
my
favorite
yearround
offering
from
boulevard
and
one
of
the
better
porters
on
the
market
if
you
can
try
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
easy
drinking
wont
mess
you
up
too
quickly
given
the
moderate
abv
and
tastes
great
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
a
very
flavorful
porter
a
must
try
i
hope
i
can
get
whole
sixers
of
this
soon
here
instead
of
having
to
pony
up
for
the
sampler
pack
drinkability
is
fairly
high
pretty
good
flavors
and
low
alcohol
make
this
beer
sessionalbe
and
easily
consumed
another
winner
from
tim
very
nice
thanks
easily
the
best
ive
had
from
boulevard
fullbodied
but
not
thick
with
all
the
attributes
id
look
for
to
fulfill
my
porter
cravings
bully
indeed
harumph
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
but
not
opaque
head
was
relatively
thin
one
finger
with
good
lacing
which
seems
to
be
typical
of
all
boulevard
products
smell
was
not
great
as
i
could
sense
the
oncoming
carbonation
taste
reflected
the
smell
in
that
the
carbonation
really
shown
through
and
offset
the
richness
which
i
expect
from
a
good
porter
much
like
every
other
style
of
beer
in
the
boulevard
line
ive
had
better
overall
a
damn
fine
porter
for
cheap
that
is
if
you
are
in
the
midwest
d
a
couple
of
these
would
be
ok
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
reddish
tint
in
the
glass
huge
2
inch
mocha
head
from
the
pour
which
stays
around
for
a
while
light
lacing
along
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
rich
blend
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
simple
but
very
inviting
the
taste
isnt
a
let
down
either
beginning
with
a
nice
strong
coffee
flavor
then
turning
to
a
smooth
roasted
malt
taste
and
ending
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
very
smooth
and
full
flavor
good
medium
thickness
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
this
was
a
highly
enjoyable
porter
great
flavor
and
good
alcohol
level
make
for
a
great
session
ale
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
this
is
what
i
expect
a
good
porter
to
taste
like
highly
recommended
a
tad
overcarbonated
but
it
seems
due
to
the
lack
of
sweetness
that
doesnt
hold
on
the
palate
it
makes
it
seem
like
it
has
too
much
carbonation
and
by
overcarbonation
i
dont
mean
that
it
stings
the
tongue
at
least
no
too
much
its
actually
quite
smooth
its
just
a
bit
thin
on
the
finish
so
there
is
a
large
carbonation
feel
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
hiding
its
alcohol
well
i
could
happily
sit
down
with
a
sixpack
or
a
growler
of
this
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
and
only
the
high
calorie
content
that
makes
this
feel
very
filling
diminishes
its
drinkability
great
kansas
city
beer
not
bad
id
drink
it
again
d
this
would
be
a
great
session
porter
easily
drinkable
tasted
on
33008
bought
as
part
of
a
sampler
12pack
the
roast
steals
the
early
show
in
the
flavor
while
the
chocolate
really
takes
a
back
seat
but
is
still
noticable
the
hops
add
a
nice
spice
throughout
the
beer
and
the
roast
and
alcohol
continue
on
long
after
taking
a
sip
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
it
is
a
bit
thinker
than
expected
but
i
would
dare
say
that
it
is
a
dash
overcarbonated
for
the
style
which
takes
away
from
the
creaminess
i
would
have
liked
it
is
a
good
porter
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
a
solid
porter
style
just
a
bit
too
carbonated
but
wonderfully
dry
and
complex
and
a
great
balance
struck
between
sweet
and
bitter
drinkability
good
the
taste
is
on
point
but
the
carbonation
would
make
me
feel
a
bit
bloated
after
a
few
233
reviews
as
of
this
writing
another
fine
brew
from
boulevard
cheers
to
the
bottle
conditioning
if
this
was
a
local
beer
for
me
i
could
easily
see
having
a
pint
or
two
while
out
for
dinner
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
roasted
grains
bitter
notes
ill
leave
the
expanded
reviews
to
the
many
others
already
posted
worth
a
try
this
beer
poured
a
nearly
opaque
brown
with
a
tan
creamy
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
toffee
sweet
smelling
the
taste
is
consistant
with
the
smell
a
bit
smokey
but
not
burnt
tastes
good
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
at
first
and
a
lot
more
carbonated
tan
im
used
to
in
a
porter
maybe
not
the
best
beer
to
be
bottle
conditioned
although
very
drinkable
would
like
to
try
one
a
bit
fresher
than
the
six
month
to
a
year
old
one
i
had
thanks
bort11
for
this
nicely
drinking
porter
dark
black
with
abundant
creamy
head
well
roasted
and
tasty
bitterness
it
grows
on
you
nice
and
certainly
above
average
porter
the
bitterness
stod
out
and
this
veered
toward
stout
yes
salty
thanks
tim
i
liked
it
so
much
i
bought
a
six
pack
to
bring
home
12oz
brown
bottle
bottle
conditioned
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
about
2
fingers
of
tan
head
chocolate
in
the
aroma
some
hops
a
slight
sourness
in
the
aroma
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
malt
in
the
flavor
solid
hop
bitterness
also
fairly
intense
roasted
malt
bitterness
very
long
dry
malt
finish
this
is
a
pretty
robust
porter
that
borders
on
stout
flavor
i
drink
this
beer
with
just
about
anything
especially
with
desserts
containing
chocolate
ive
never
been
let
down
by
the
bully
drinkablity
you
bet
i
look
forward
to
several
more
as
a
matter
of
fact
ive
got
another
bottle
i
think
ill
open
right
now
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
taste
but
a
solid
porter
it
has
a
solid
malt
backbone
but
lacks
the
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
that
other
porters
have
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
may
be
just
a
little
overcarbonated
but
i
like
it
medium
body
but
i
still
would
rate
drinkability
as
high
because
of
the
low
abv
overall
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
porter
i
am
glad
i
got
to
get
a
hold
of
it
while
this
started
out
slow
the
taste
and
finish
definitely
improved
as
the
beer
sat
this
beer
definitely
gets
better
as
it
warms
last
bottle
from
a
sampler
box
this
one
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
chestnut
body
with
a
tall
cocoa
head
retention
is
excellent
and
there
is
an
abundance
of
sticky
lace
left
on
the
pint
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
understated
but
teases
with
milk
chocolate
and
a
berry
fruitiness
medium
body
has
a
tad
too
much
carbonation
taste
begins
with
some
bitter
roasted
notes
followed
by
a
wave
of
dark
chocolate
and
subtle
hops
a
hint
of
dark
berry
underneath
a
very
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
american
porter
d
somewhat
thick
and
dry
with
low
abv
fairly
drinkable
good
sessionable
porter
but
a
bit
too
thick
and
would
actually
like
some
more
kick
black
pour
with
a
big
tan
head
smell
is
roasty
but
quite
hoppy
too
smells
like
it
will
be
quite
bitter
taste
however
is
nicely
rich
and
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
a
touch
of
mild
hops
but
not
very
bitter
like
the
aroma
indicated
perhaps
a
touch
too
carbonated
for
a
porter
but
it
has
a
good
flavor
and
character
to
it
and
is
a
nice
one
overall
a
great
beer
by
blvd
definitely
will
drink
this
one
again
and
will
seek
it
out
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
i
want
to
have
more
in
this
delivery
method
dextreme
drinkability
for
the
style
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sit
down
with
and
drink
a
couple
while
you
relax
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
like
my
favorite
porter
black
butte
this
beer
is
very
easy
drinking
very
approachable
and
loaded
with
flavor
the
low
abv
makes
this
brew
very
sessionable
and
perfect
for
sitting
back
and
watching
the
game
there
is
a
really
different
taste
profile
in
this
brew
leather
that
was
a
welcome

that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
big
thanks
again
to
vancer
hell
yes
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
thanks

this
beer
poured
a
black
color
with
a
tan
two
finger
head
it
was
a
creamy
looking
pour
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
the
smell
and
taste
are
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
chocolate
on
the
tounge
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
being
more
watery
than
the
pour
showed
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
i
would
drink
this
one
agian
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
dry
earthy
char
in
the
finish
the
body
is
full
and
lactic
two
or
three
of
these
on
tap
would
make
a
perfect
session
it
was
sad
to
finish
the
glass
and
have
to
move
on
somewhere
else
boulevard
bully
porter
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
touch
of
brownish
red
at
the
top
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
a
creamy
tan
and
dissipates
within
a
minute
it
gives
off
a
malty
smell
and
has
a
bit
of
a
burnt
aroma
to
it
bullys
taste
is
pretty
good
from
the
start
and
better
at
the
finish
a
nice
malty
touch
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
that
seems
to
fade
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
this
drinks
nice
and
easy
due
its
smooth
mouthfeel
and
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
from
boulevard
brewing
co
hops
are
present
but
do
not
overpower
the
malt
base
the
malt
has
a
nice
blended
flavor
of
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
possibly
some
fruits
as
well
but
cant
pick
them
out
great
porter
a
very
good
selection
this
may
be
my
favorite
from
boulevard
thus
far
and
one
ill
be
certain
to
grab
again
terrific
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
massive
tan
head
smells
of
toasted
grain
tastes
of
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
with
a
good
malt
sweet
background
and
a
slight
hop
flavor
with
good
bitterness
to
balance
i
was
surprised
with
how
dry
the
beer
finished
full
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
quite
drinkable
one
of
boulevards
best
offerings
imo
bottle
conditioned
also
which
is
always
a
plus
this
beer
poured
a
black
color
with
a
big
offwhite
head
and
tight
bubbles
the
aroma
is
roasted
with
a
pronounced
sweetmolasses
smell
the
taste
is
roasted
and
malty
it
is
bitter
with
enough
sweetness
to
make
it
quite
palatable
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
like
in
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
definitely
something
id
enjoy
having
again
d
very
good
porter
great
with
chocolate
pours
out
a
beautiful
mix
of
dark
ruby
and
nutty
brown
with
a
thick
mocha
head
with
a
raised
island
in
the
middle
as
it
recedes
after
some
time
it
leaves
huge
chunky
lace
on
the
glass
nose
is
big
on
soft
fresh
fruits
undercut
with
a
does
of
milk
chocolate
shy
roast
character
lurks
around
in
there
as
well
as
a
vague
hop
aroma
the
typical
boulevard
fruity
esters
hold
a
big
presence
in
the
flavor
as
well
while
the
roasted
malt
comes
out
in
full
force
giving
dark
chocolate
and
mediumhigh
roast
coffee
flavors
i
pick
up
on
some
faint
citrus
and
pine
from
the
hops
finishes
pleasantly
dry
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
hint
of
sugar
stickiness
carbonation
is
active
but
fine
and
soft
decent
porter
but
somehow
lacking
impressed
though
stouts
arent
my
favorite
style
i
can
easily
say
this
is
the
best
of
the
boulevard
beers
ive
had
so
far
very
tasty
and
satisfyingly
complex
deep
deep
mahogany
beer
with
a
huge
tan
head
on
top
that
takes
forever
to
recede
not
a
lot
of

roasted
and
nutty
roasted
and
chocolatey
flavor
though
somewhat
harsh
and
astringent
heck
of
a

bite
to
itquite
the
grapefruit
against
the
roasted
flavors
ok
mouthfeelthe
excessive
hops
detract
a
bit
for
me
ok
for
the
most
partoverly
hopped
for
my
liking
in
a
porter
this
is
better
the
troegs
dead
reckoning
but
i
would
prefer
my
hops
in
some
other
style
thanks
to

frothy

and
stays
for
the

this

good

and
enjoyable
on
this
cooling
fall
evening
d
a
well
made
american
porter
from
a
solid
midwest
us
brewery
this
is
a
really
good
porter
colour
is
almost
black
with
a
beautiful
cream
colored
head
that
laces
the
glass
smell
is
of
hops
and
malt
with
some
fruit
palate
is
thick
and
pleasing
about
the
consistency
of
chocolate
milk
but
has
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
tastes
chocolate
cream
hops
leaves
behind
some
acidity
d
the
low
abv
and
inviting
taste
makes
this
dangerous
i
could
sit
and
feast
on
this
beer
for
hours
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
head
the
smell
was
very
malty
with
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
the
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
nose
with
tastes
of
coffee
caramel
and
roasted
malts
real
heavy
on
the
coffee
flavors
though
the
mouthfeel
was
heavy
and
it
had
medium
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
i
could
drink
this
beer
often
if
it
was
available
down
in
la
d
its
smooth
its
not
overpowering
or
too
sweet
i
would
call
this
a
very
drinkable
porter
overall
a
very
well
made
porter
and
a
great
cool
weather
drink
i
think
this
is
by
far
the
best
brew
coming
out
of
the
boulevard
brewery
to
date
oooh
this
was
very
nice
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
roasted
malt
and
coffee
come
through
in
the
taste
as
well
and
then
some
hop
bitterness
comes
up
to
balance
things
out
and
add
some
nice
depth
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
good
carbonation
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
dark
brown
clear
around
the
edges
with
a
bit
of
a
reddish
hue
to
the
highlights
the
tan
foam
was
really
fizzy
and
settled
quickly
to
a
thin
cap
some
spotty
sticky
lacing
rich
malty
aroma
lots
of
milk
chocolate
toffee
and
caramelized
sugar
light
citrusy
hop
notes
in
the
background
mild
to
medium
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
finish
but
its
definitely
balanced
towards
malt
throughout
some
cocoa
and
light
roast
citrusy
middle
toffee
sweetness
decent
mouthfeel
medium
body
and
carbonation
bubbles
were
a
little
coarse
but
still
fine
a
solid
porter
i
just
didnt
feel
that
the
great
aroma
transferred
well
to
the
flavour
if
it
did
it
would
be
fantastic
overall
this
a
moderate
porter
in
both
taste
and
alcohol
d
this
is
so
drinkable
i
asked
for
it
in
trade
and
im
glad
i
did
this
should
be
on
the
top
of
the
list
for
any
fan
of
porters
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beers
body
is
on
the
plus
side
of
medium
the
carbonation
is
low
but
perfect
for
this
beer
this
beer
drank
really
fast
i
had
major
problems
slowing
down
enough
to
properly
savior
this
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
only
wish
all
the
boulevard
line
was
of
this
caliber
overall
impression
a
big
roasty
flavorful
robust
porter
the
roasted
character
pushes
the
envelope
but
its
restrained
enough
to
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
well
done
good
medium
body
maybe
a
tad
too
carbonated
but
i
can
deal
with
it
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
these
while
watching
a
football
game
i
wish
it
was
available
in
these
parts
this
one
will
stay
on
my
wants
list
for
a
while
thanks
to
whomever
it
was
that
sent
me
this
bottle
d
very
refreshing
for
a
porter
sessionable
d
very
drinkable
a
complex
enough
flavor
that
i
dont
tire
of
it
even
after
too
many
with
a
reasonable
abv
no
noticable
taste
of
alcohol
its
a
good
thing
the
bar
is
within
walking
distance
of
home
thanks
to
unclejedi
for
sending
this
my
way
poured
from
a
12oz
brown
twist
off
bottle
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
light
tan
head
minimal
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
as
i
make
my
way
to
the
bottom
smells
of
caramel
cocoa
mild
coffee
and
molasses
tastes
of
mocha
semisweet
malt
and
bitter
hops
medium
in
body
but
slightly
over
carbonated
for
my
tastes
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
lively
carbonation
and
the
drinkabiity
is
really
good
until
the
smokestack
series
comes
out
this
is
the
best
that
boulevard
has
to
offer
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
of
bitter
semisweet
chocolate
with
a
spritzy
organic
yeast
flavor
very
tasty
this
porter
mouthfeel
is
nearperfect
on
the
carbonation
and
has
an
amazingly
strong
coffee
finish
but
the
body
is
a
tad
bit
too
thin
to
get
a
perfect

this
porter
is
a
solid
if
not
the
best
offer
from
boulevard
that
ive
tried
it
definately
has
a
great
taste
and
enough
complexity
to
keep
the
biggest
dark
beer
fans
satisfied
nice
pour
by
the
bartender
at
fox
and
hound
out
in
chesterfield
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
perfect
light
brown
head
that
has
pretty
decent
retention
aroma
is
of
chocolate
caramel
and
a
touch
of
fruitiness
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
with
a
nice
hoppiness
to
it
as
well

great
offering
from
the

across
the
state

quite
enjoyed
it
not
a
bad
porter

any
means

right
up

in
the
good
porters
to
me
appearance
is
about
average
dark
brown
near
black
nice

though
it
isnt
around
too
much
longer
than
it
rises
up
smells
like
chocolate
and
coffee
mostly
taste
follows
scent
fairly
close
and
come
close
to
picking
up
some
extra
points
chocolate
caramel
toffee
and
a
hint
of
coffee
come
through
mouthfeel
is
close
to
medium
and
maybe
a
little
on
the
light
side
though
it
is
good
in
most
aspects
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
greatly
and
could
drink
plenty
more
than
the
one
i
received
in
a
trade
im
honestly
not
positive
who
traded
this
with
me
as
it
was
an
extra

into
a

the
color
was
pitch
black
even
when
up
to
a
light
it
had
a
small
brownish
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
collar
the
aroma
was
very
good
and
was
roasted
malts
with
a
choc
and
coffee
tone
the
taste
was
also
really
good
and
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
lately
goes
down
pretty
smooth
with
a
nice
balance
and
no
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
also
good

a
really
enjoyable
porter

rbooa
t
y
mouthfeel
was
appropriately
mediumthin
zesty
yet
rounded
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
smell
and
texture
but
the
flavor
was
just
a
bit
off
and
not
really
as
fresh
as
the
aroma
this
beer
is
close
to
being
a
really
good

porter
from
this
brewery
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try

very
nice
could
drink
many
during
a
sitting
and
wishing
i
had
another
nice
mouthfeel
a
little
thin

not

watery
good

as
well
carbonation
is
nearly
perfect
a
very
nice
porter
when
all
is
said
and
done
glad
i
got
this
one
thanks
vancer
overall
this
was
a
very
good
porter
nothing
about
it
stood
out
as
outstanding
but
it
was
solid
and
very
drinkable
d
solid
porter
and
a
great
session
beer
not
too
far
away
from
an
irish
dry
stout
imo
d
i
hate
comparing
beers
but
this
right
off
the
bat
reminded
me
of
deschutes
black
butte
only
better
sorry
deschutes
i
still
love
you
a
very
easy
drinkin
and
well
made
porter
very
nice
mouthfeel
these
simply
slide
down
but
merit
contemplation
if
you
want
to
slow
down
and
appreciate
it
fine
food
beer
as
well
porter
poured
blackbrown
in
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
almost
more
like
a
stout
it
had
an
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
which
blended
into
the
taste
as
well
but
it
also
picked
up
a
taste
of
coffee
that
was
not
present
in
the
smell
not
a
really
strong
taste
compared
to
other
porters
and
not
as
strong
in
alcohol
content
but
very
drinkable
d
the
more
this
beer
warms
and
the
more
i
get
into
it
the
more
im
enjoying
it
wish
i
could
get
it
in
nj
this
particular
bottle
of
bully
porter
pours
black
with
a
hint
of
ruby
along
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
that
forms
an
appealing
offwhite
head
that
slowly
falls
leaving
some
intricate
lacework
down
the
the
sides
of
my
glass
a
whisp
of
a
charcoal
minty
aroma
is
interesting
and
enticing
this
porter
empahsizes
some
roasted
malt
flavors
along
with
a
clean
bitterness
in
the
dry
finish
some
chocolate
flavors
help
make
this
beer
tasty
too
this
isnt
a
very
complex
porter
but
rather
a
simple
and
tasty
one
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
tastes
if
roasty
dark
malt
milky
coffee
flavors
finishes
bitter
mouth
is
lighter
than
you
would
expect
and
its
not
very
complex
but
does
what
it
does
well
tasty
roasty
porter
that
would
be
a
great
session
brew
thanks
to
fellow
buffalo
ba
orfeu
for
this
bottle
i
opened
right
after
i
walked
in
the
doorpoured
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
big
blooming
tannish
colored
head
that
took
its
time
settling
slowly
raw
earthy
aromas
really
stick
out
here
slight
woodiness
and
light
coffee
notesas
like
the
nose
i
fownd
it
somewhat
reaw
and
earthy
with
woodyunsweetened
chocolate
and
cola
notesa
pretty
abrupt
finish
to
it
the
flavors
dont
linger
much
a
decent
porter
i
have
had
better
but
its
drinkable
12ounce

at

smooth

very
drinkable
brown
porter
a
solid
sessioner
for
sure
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
porters
that
ive
tasted
its
dry
and
woody
which
makes
it
more
drinkable
than
some
sugarcoated
porters
out
there
just
a
really
outstanding
brew
this
was
the
last
bottle
of
the
6pack
i
picked
up
in
the
states
in
early
october
i
really
enjoyed
them
and
would
definitely
purchase
again
its
an
agressive
porter
for
sure
but
tasteful
nonetheless
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
overall
impression
very
nice
porter
highly
drinkable
with
complex
flavors
i
really
wish
this
was
available
in
colorado
12
oz
bottle
best
before
1607
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
thick
fluffy
tan
head
holds
together
very
well
nice
roasty
chocolate
notes
in
the
aroma
combined
with
some
floral
hops
flavors
begin
with
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
carry
on
with
roasty
notes
and
finish
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
citrusy
hops
very
well
balanced
finishes
somewhat
dry
maybe
a
bit
thin
but
that
is
the
only
negative
thing
i
can
say
about
this
this
is
a
very
solid
porter
really
good
drinkability
nice
aroma
and
flavor
makes
this
one
easy
to
put
back
sits
light
on
the
stomach
i
could
have
several
d
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
but
all
in
all
not
a
bad
porter
reddish
black
in
color
huge
head
that
can
get
out
of
control
if
you
dont
pour
it
carefully
but
eventually
subsides
and
clings
desperately
to
the
glass
and
is
very
creamy
smells
roasted
and
slightly
sweet
tastes
of
dark
roasted
coffee
and
hops
right
at
the
end
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
pretty
good
this
is
a
nice
brew
and
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
it
up
again
sometime
d
for
a
porter
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
pleasantly
surprised
as
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
good
buy
recommend
it
if
you
see
it
a
big
sip
spreads
out
thinly
on
the
tongue
like
a
good
porter
should
and
drinks
effortlessly
refreshing
to
drink
this
brew
leaves
a
mouthful
of
sweet
roasted
flavor
behind
man
i
really
do
love
this
offering
by
boulevard
overall
i
think
this
is
a
modest
example
of
the
style
i
normally
prefer
american
porters
with
a
bit
more
body
and
stronger
presence
of
roasted
maltgrain
this
beer
poured
a
very
very
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
had
a
thick
2
finger
tan
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
and
ended
with
a
quarter
inch
head
that
was
still
around
when
i
finished
this
creamy
brew
the
smell
was
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
with
hints
of
toffee
the
taste
had
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
with
a
little
caramel
sweetness
this
is
a
very
full
bodied
flavorful
porter
that
i
will
definately
keep
around
to
enjoy
again
and
again
served
from
a
twist
off
bottle
that
gave
off
a
doughy
threee
finger
head
lots
of
bubbling
can
be
noticed
when
held
to
the
light
along
with
the
blood
blood
red
garnet
amidst
the
bubbling
and
spectacular
lacing
of
this
twist
off
bottle
beer
plenty
of
roasty
and
smokey
aromas
this
smokiness
evokes
plenty
of
memories
of
backyard
fires
with
friends
and
beer
plenty
of
coffee
toffee
and
chocolate
in
this
beer
lots
of
roast
in
the
paate
of
this
brew
bully
porter
was
very
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
it
had
a
large
tan
head
that
lasted
a
long
time
with
lots
of
lacing
left
behind
there
was
chocolate
and
some
coffee
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
suberb
alot
of
dark
malt
flavor
along
with
a
little
chocolate
and
coffee
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
a
regular
in
my
fridge
thanks
to
bditty
for
this
good
brew
d
a
very
enjoyable
porter
and
at
an
affordable
price
good
brew
definetly
worth
a
try
a
solid
easy
drinking
porter
a
good
example
of
the
style
very
quaffable
one
of
the
top
10
porters
ive
ever
had
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
bit
of
a
hard
pour
created
a
massive
dark
tan
head
its
chunky
and
leaves
a
strong
lace
the
color
is
a
dark
purpleblack
smell
is
a
roasted
coffee
bitter
and
sweet
the
taste
matches
the
smell
and
then
some
very
bold
and
straitforward
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
a
little
creamy
with
mild
carbonation
finishes
with
a
pleasant
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
an
excellent
porter
in
the
right
mood
i
could
session
these
boulevard
never
disappoints
me
i
think
this
beer
would
have
been
better
with
a
bit
more
umph
to
the
body
for
a
porter
i
kinda
like
quite
a
bit
more
body
that
this
available
all
across
missouri
in
supermarkets
as
blvd
is
the
second
largest
brewery
in
missouri
a
good
goto
if
the
store
you
are
in
does
not
have
anything
from
bells
overall
this
is
a
really
awesome
porter
very
robust
and
satysifying
in
flavor
and
feel
perhaps
a
bit
weak
on
color
and
id
personally
like
a
bit
more
aroma
man
i
could
easily
drink
these
until
i
couldnt
stand
and
be
very
happy
this
brew
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
a
massive
three
fingers
in
height
rocky
and
light
tan
this
is
all
that
a
porter
should
look
like
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
and
coffee
each
fighting
the
other
and
my
nose
winning
the
taste
is
fabulous
the
sip
begins
with
chocolate
and
finishes
with
burnt
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
relative
smoothness
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
porters
i
have
had
to
date
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
some
might
like
that
but
i
think
porters
should
be
a
bit
thinner
i
could
drink
gallons
of
this
none
the
less
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
14
tan
head
above
the
clear
dark
burgundy
brew
pillow
head
lasts
very
nicely
with
plentiful
bubbly
lacing
aroma
is
roasted
grain
sweetness
taste
is
also
dark
malt
sweetness
with
some
wisps
of
smoke
and
a
lightly
crisp
close
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
very
nice
maybe
a
bit
thin
but
thats
to
style
could
certainly
revisit
this
one
during
a
session
drinkability
is
good
a
very
tasty
porter
very
nicely
done
would
make
this
one
a
regular
if
i
could
thanks
go
to
babydoc
and
bcg
bif
for
this
treat
pours
a
black
color
with
a
solid
three
finger
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
and
hops
yummmm
taste
of
a
strong
coffee
hint
of
chocolate
and
i
taste
a
bit
of
a
soy
milk
in
there
nice
alcohol
finish
that
gives
it
the
perfect
amount
of
bite
feels
crisp
and
a
little
thick
in
the
mouth
the
headyes
its
still
there
feels
good
on
your
lips
when
you
drink
drinkability
is
good
nice
session
porter
i
love
porters
and
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
duckrabbit
porter
for
my
favorite
overall
an
excellent
porter
from
boulevard
brewing
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
many
many
thanks
go
out
to
dertbert
he
is
an
exceptional
trader
malt
chocolate
and
hop
aroma
deep
black
with
an
unruly
two
finger
thick
head
more
coffee
more
roasted
barley
and
more
happiness
for
me
nothing
over
the
top
about
this
it
is
just
straight
forward
good
and
still
manges
a
big
feel
despite
not
being
desperately
hopped
like
some
brewers
attempt
fantastic
thanks
slob
appearance
is
nondescript
very
dark
brown
with
a
weak
head
a
fruity
hoppy
smell
is
apparent
and
enticing
the
flavor
is
roasted
barley
with
more
than
usual
fruit
flavors
and
the
bitterness
is
a
little
lower
than
average
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
gives
the
beer
substance
finishes
clean
and
fruity
the
hop
characteristics
are
similar
to
those
of
some
sierra
nevada
offerings
and
they
really
help
me
like
this
beer
this
is
a
simple
and
delicate
porter
that
ill
pick
up
again
sometime
hint
definitely
dont
drink
this
at
below
45
degrees
f
this
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
there
is
a
hint
of
hops
and
chocolate
in
the
smell
the
taste
has
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
slightly
hoppy
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
overall
this
is
not
an
overly
complex
porter
but
it
is
a
fairly
nice
one
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
i
enjoyed
the
opportunity
of
trying
it
nice
two
finger
tan
head
forms
when
poured
and
laces
very
well
colors
is
opaque
brown
with
red
edging
a
nice
looking
brew
sitting
on
the
bar
the
smell
is
nice
a
sweet
waft
of
malt
and
caramel
with
a
biting
coffee
and
hops
aroma
the
taste
is
full
of
coffee
not
too
carbonated
but
ample
very
nice
hop
finish
is
sharp
and
keeps
you
sipping
somewhat
drier
than
i
had
expected
a
nice
surprise
the
feel
is
a
bit
water
especially
at
finish
which
hurts
the
beer
more
than
it
should
i
knock
the
drinkability
a
little
bit
due
to
the
mouthfeel
and
the
dryness
that
might
not
invite
everyone
in
very
nice
porter
a
little
light
in
body
but
excellent
for
taste
smooth
creamy
and
very
drinkable
pretty
uninspiring
earlier
bottles
ive
had
showed
more
yeast
qualities
and
i
liked
them
better
but
that
was
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
wonder
if
aging
had
an
influence
very
drinkable
i
would
love
to
have
this
available
all
the
time
it
is
very
nice
very
dark
pour
with
a
small
yes
consistent
head
great
aroma
tons
of
roasted
malts
also
some
cherry
and
chocolate
noticable
for
me
the
taste
didnt
coincide
with
the
aroma
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
for
my
liking
there
were
some
floral
hops
that
added
a
bitter
overtone
to
the
beer
and
they
could
have
been
toned
down
a
bit
for
me
this
beer
started
out
great
and
became
increasingly
more
difficult
to
drink
a
decent
porter
at
first
transformed
into
a
tough
drinker
something
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
on
a
different
occasion
as
i
could
tell
this
beer
had
potential
in
the
words
of
elton
john
the
boulevard
is
not
that
bad

thanks
to
for
this
fantastic
beer
as
part
of
the
ncaa

a
fantastic
deep
rich
chocolate
robust
porter
with
a
nice
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
melds
so
nicely
with
the
sweetness
quite
nice
and
one
i
will
definitely
enjoy
again
i
would
stock
this
beer
in
my
refrigerator
if
i
could
get
it
in
new
jersey
pair
this
with
smoke
stacks
burnt
ends
gates
ribs
or
burnt
ends
or
wyandotts
pulled
pork
and
burnt

this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
little
light
showing
trhough
the
thick
fluffy
head
is
brown
and
it
fades
rather
slowly
it
leaves
thick
laces
it
has
a
malty
aroma
with
a
good
caramel
aroma
it
has
a
chocolate
aroma
also
i
can
not
detect
much
hop
presence
this
beer
tastes
malty
also
it
has
a
chocolate
taste
the
hops
are
not
too
present
in
the
flavor
either
the
roasted
malts
are
very
appealing
on
the
palate
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
leaving
a
malty
caramel
aftertaste
it
might
be
just
a
little
overcarbonated
but
that
is
alright
this
beer
might
make
a
good
session
beer
it
is
low
on
alcohol
and
the
flavor
is
good
and
not
overbearing
i
would
stock
this
beer
in
my
refrigerator
if
i
could
get
it
in
southern
california
thanks
karst
for
sending
me
another
great
beer
oh
the
possibilities
expansive
carbonation
works
well
with
the
chewy
malt
body
near
perfect
porter
consistency
satisfying
and
easy
to
consume
a
bit
drier
and
more
robust
than
many
other
porters
but
it
suits
it
well
wouldnt
mind
a
few
more
of
these
right
now
thanks
go
out
to
fellow

for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
this
poured
into
the
shaker

brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
head
left
clumps
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
receded
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
cherry
the
flavor
has
tons
of
the
roast
malt
a
bit
of
espresso
some
of
the
cherry
some
citrus
orange
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
slick
and
feels
a
little
oily
decent
drinakbility
porter
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
good
beer
its
a
flavorful
porter
that
pairs
perfectly
with
the
steak
comming
off
the
grill
add
family
and
friends
and
carpe
diem
medium
bodied
and
long
on
the
sweet

a
very
drinkable

yet
another
one
that
they
should
have
over
here
on
the
east

overall
comments
good
solid
porter
somehow
this
beer
tastes
like
what
i
remember
sierra
nevada
porter
tasting
like
back
in
the
day
great
balance
to
the
flavors
and
it
has
the
hallmark
boulevard
flavor
created
by
their
choice
of
yeast
great
brew
this
is
a
very
nice
looking
dark
brown
beer
with
a
persistent
creamy
tan
head
there
is
a
strong
scent
of
roasted
malt
and
some
hops
some
chocolate
and
vanilla
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
is
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
which
i
like
it
starts
out
nice
and
malty
and
ends
with
a
dry
bitterness
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
bitter
aftertaste
lingers
a
long
time
not
a
big
deal
if
you
are
snacking
or
drinking
fast
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
prefer
a
little
more
body
drinkability
is
good
big
frothy
tan
head
atop
dark
molasses
body
a
great
blend
of
coffee
chocolate
malt
flavors
man
this
porters
got
some
hops
pine
flavors
remain
a
background
flavor
but
blossom
in
the
aftertaste
this
porters
got
some
spice
originally
i
attributed
the
spice
to
simple
heat
from
the
alcohol
but
later
i
realized
it
was
just
the
hops
wish
this
was
local
translucent
ruby
dark
brown
with
big
beige
head
that
falls
to
a
sturdy
beige
ring
nose
is
so
complex
walnut
molasses
smoky
and
a
little
anise
in
there
for
good
measure
taste
follows
the
nose
with
some
fizzy
chocolate
and
a
wonderful
hop
bite
that
closes
it
out
mouthfeel
is
slick
initially
then
the
hops
and
bubbles
roughen
things
up
finish
is
medium
long
tasty
this
is
what
porters
are
about
at
least
in
the
us
highly
recommended
it
poured
with
a
deep
brown
head
that
had
lots
of
exploding
co2
bubbles
it
was
fascinating
to
watch
as
the
thick
head
reduced
itself
away
it
had
a
great
sweet
maltiness
on
the
nose
with
sort
of
a
chocolate
smell
to
it
the
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
my
first
thought
after
tasting
it
was
man
this
is
porter
roasty
nutty
chocolaty
all
of
these
flavors
are
evident
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
and
rich
i
noted
a
charcoalsmokiness
on
the
finish
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
bittersweet
chocolate
yummy
tasted
of
bitter
chocolate
with
malt
and
some
darksweet
fuit
behind
the
malt
in
the
middle
that
gave
way
to
dark
cocoa
powder
coating
the
the
tongue
in
the
dry
finish
hops
rear
up
and
bite
in
the
finish
too
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
bite
of
carbonation
in
the
start
thinner

the
finish

the

pours
a

color
with
a
finger
of

that
coats
the
top
well
the
nose
is
rich
in
citrusy

with
a
more
distant
slightly
chocolatey
malt
the
flavor
is
coffee
and
nice
citrusy
hops
but
there
is
a
huge
bit
of
metallic
in
the
aftertaste
i
wish
that
was
not
there
the
feel
is
thick
with
a
moderate
bit
of
carbonation
overall
the
metallic
takes
a
lot
away
from
the
experience
with
this
beer
it
really
stays
a
long
time
and
detracts
a
very
nice
porter
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
big
thanks
to
rajendra82
for
the
bottle
the
taste
was
creamy
smooth
coffee
and
bitter
burnt
toast
and
was
aided
by
the
soft
carbonation
coating
my
tongue
there
was
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
could
have
been
better
if
the
beer
was
just
a
touch
thicker
dry
and
roasty
this
is
a
good
mainstream
porter
worth
a
try
a
good
one

smooth
pour
with
frothy
brown
head
that
left
nice
lacing
throughout
the
drink
could
smell
the
hops
and
the
taste
was
also
quite
hoppy
with
a
trace
of
roasted
malt
good
low
carbonated
even
from
the
bottle

left
with
a
dry
aftertaste
put
er
on
the
list
for
some
quiet
evenings
by
the
fire
and
enjoy
besides
maybe
nutcracker
ale
the
best
boulevard
offering
the
flavors
great
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
toffee
and
coffee
the
hop
finish
reminds
me
of
british
brown
ales
it
isnt
all
that
complicated
but
perhaps
that
adds
to
it
this
is
just
a
great
straightforward
porter
it
is
a
deep
brown
with
a
short
tan
head
some
lacing
this
one
seems
to
just
dissappear
the
mouthfeel
is
where
this
brew
excels
though
fizzy
as
can
be
dancing
on
the
back
of
the
throat
and
tickling
your
tongue
long
after
its
been
drank
the
nice
coffee
aftertaste
mixes
with
the
easy
body
to
make
this
an
easydrinking
brew
deep
khacki
head
settles
over
clear
deep
brownish
red
liquid
roasty
chocolate
and
light
coffee
in
the
nose
with
some
dark
fruitiness
as
well
the
taste
has
notes
of
bitterly
roasted
grains
that
suggest
espresso
mixing
with
ample
hoppiness
and
a
light
phenol
bandaid
character
finishes
dry
and
roasty
pouring
into
a
goblet
glass
the
bully
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
allowing
absolutely
zero
amounts
of
light
through
the
glass
two
fingers
thick
of
spongy
tan
head
layer
the
top
of
the
brew
the
head
clings
to
the
glass
pretty
tight
and
leaves
nice
edge
lacing
caramel
malts
highlight
the
aroma
along
with
some
slight
rasberry
chocolate
coffee
comes
to
mind
as
well
however
not
too
potent
is
the
aromas
and
not
so
complex
the
taste
is
mainly
of
sweet
caramel
and
even
a
slight
fruitiness
on
the
swallow
a
slight
smoke
flavor
comes
through
and
finally
a
bitter
unsweetened
chocolate
bakers
choco
right
on
the
finish
overall
the
feel
is
thinbodied
w
some
moderate
carbonation
that
coats
the
palete
making
tasting
not
as
enjoyable
as
some
other
porters
i
have
had
in
the
past
overall
not
a
bad
brew
the
beer
pours
to
a
dark
brown
not
completely
opaque
and
revealing
a
slight
maroon
color
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
a
tan
color
which
leaves
no
lacing
but
stays
at
least
a
half
finger
deep
throughout
the
glass
the
smell
is
quite
enticing
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
hops
the
taste
provides
an
onslaught
chocolatee
deliciousness
and
hops
bitterness
with
such
a
low
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
still
crave
more
for
an
added
drinkability
bonus
try
it
with
your
favorite
chocolate
candy
bar
pretty
good
porter
here
although
i
prefer
summits
and
sierra
nevadas
ive
seen
this
one
for
a
while
now
and
never
grabbed
it
im
glad
i
did
because
its
good
but
in
the
future
ill
stick
with
those
other
two
12
oz
screwcap
bottle
obtained
from
to
your
health
coralville
in
january
2005
and
consumed
that
same
evening
pours
a
tan
finger
an
a
halfhead
the
settles
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
over
the
beer
very
dark
appearance
extremely
dark
mohogany
when
held
to
light
smells
of
chocolate
and
roast
with
searching
i
get
perhaps
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
currant
wet
sweet
to
start
and
then
a
delay
before
the
chocolate
jumps
in
followed
quickly
by
roasted
grains
i
get
a
cherry
like
sour
before
a
shot
carbonation
on
my
tongue
and
then
a
dry
and
roast
grain
finish
now
for
the
fruits
yeah
i
get
some
but
cant
put
my
finger
on
any
particular
one
tastes
and
looks
like
more
of
a
stout
than
a
porter
but
the
mediumlight
mouthfeel
is
in
style
with
a
porter
sloshing
around
in
my
mouth
its
medium
bodied
but
it
goes
down
the
throat
very
thin
lotsa
interesting
qualities
to
this
one
its
worth
trying
but
not
tremendously
drinkable
overall
a
very
fine
porter
this
beer
is
better
than
i
imagined
it
to
be
the
highly
touted
bully
porter
is
a
brewing
masterpiece
it
is
blackish
brown
and
has
a
big
tan
head
and
looks
about
as
good
as
a
porter
can
get
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
coffee
and
the
hops
mix
with
the
coffee
and
dark
malt
aromas
to
make
everything
interesting
you
could
pull
a
lot
of
different
aromas
out
of
there
if
only
for
a
fleeting
moment
the
taste
is
every
bit
as
complex
and
i
am
too
much
of
a
novice
to
pick
them
out
i
am
too
busy
enjoying
this
beer
i
am
impressed
a
very
sessionable
porter
maybe
more
of
an
english
style
with
the
gentle
touch
it
has
if
this
were
available
in
my
area
id
probably
buy
it
often
a
nice
easy
going
beer
to
sip
after
work
with
perhaps
another
to
follow
this
brew
is
a
deep
black
color
with
some
brownish
hues
showing
through
the
light
good
sized
frothy
tan
head
tops
off
the
brew
light
hop
scent
mixes
with
creamy
chocolate
malts
a
moderately
roasted
malt
profile
starts
off
the
taste
somewhat
acidic
mouth
flowery
hops
back
up
the
malts
a
pretty
solid
porter
worth
a
check
overall
a
very
nice
american
porter
and
probably
boulevards
best
offering
however
i
dont
drink
it
very
often
because
i
can

oh
man
have
had
this
bottle
for
what
seems
forever
sorry
this
was
a
gift
from
fellow
ba
uncle
jimbo
thanks
i
think
we
got
lucky
as
this
beer
is
still
nice
and
tasty
pour
was
very
dark
chocolate
brown
in
fact
its
opaque
aroma
is
really
nice
the
dark
roast
character
really
comes
across
as
being
almost
of
alcohol
but
i
am
reassured
by
the
abv
listed
here
i
find
the
mouthfeel
medium
nice
small
carbonation
tastewise
nothing
has
suffered
too
much
the
beer
is
almost
really
really
good
but
the
finish
is
just
a
bit
jaring
initial
taste
is
rich
roasty
maybe
more
java
than
cocoa
like
interesting
slightly
smokey
note
before
the
finish
kicks
in
the
finish
is
just
not
as
smooth
as
the
initial
taste
or
else
i
would
have
rated
this
higher
the
finish
just
seems
slightly
rocky
would
i
getdrink
this
again
heck
yes
its
very
good
really
no
disapointment
here
while
im
not
a
huge
porter
fan
i
love
to
down
a
few
once
in
a
while
this
is
an
excellent
brew
to
sample
if
you
havent
yet
and
one
that
lives
up
to
its
reputation
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
fizzy
tan
head
there
was
low
retention
of
the
head
it
thinned
down
quickly
to
show
the
clear
brown
beer
the
nose
had
notes
of
cherry
sweetness
and
dark
malt
the
flavor
was
surprisingly
nondistinct
there
were
the
usual
dark
malts
flavors
but
not
much
else
its
a
bit
too
carbonated
and
i
think
that
disrupts
the
tasting
it
is
also
a
bit
t
oo
thin
in
the
mouth
almost
watery
pours
a
light
blackdark
brown
with
a
smallish
light
tan
head
nice
sheet
of
lacing
smells
nice
and
coffee
like
taste
wise
it
starts
of
rather
chocolaty
with
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
coffe
takes
over
and
rules
the
day
finishes
with
a
mild
lingering
bitterness
moderate
mouthfeel
and
nicely
drinkable
solid
porter
pours
out
a
deeo
rubybrownish
color
pretty
much
black
comes
with
a
thic
rocky
light
tan
head
that
stays
for
much
of
the
glass
lacin
was
impressive
aroma
is
of
bakers
chocolate
soy
sauce
and
a
little
bit
of
roasted
nuttiness
taste
is
lovely
bitter
chocolate
no
sweetness
roasted
nuts
and
black
coffee
mouthfeel
is
moderately
thick
leaves
the
same
film
in
the
mouth
as
milk
would
a
little
dry
but
very
pleasing
neat
picture
of
a
pompous
looking
highsociety
type
bulldog
drinking
a
brew
on
the
front
the
beer
was
poured
aggressively
and
produced
a
thick
full
tan
head
over
a
very
dark
brew
that
has
reddish
hue
when
held
to
a
light
the
head
gradually
passed
to
a
rocky
texture
that
then
gradually
dissipated
leaving
some
belgian
lace
foam
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
kind
of
faint
but
pleasant
having
some
hints
of
roastiness
along
with
a
faint
earthiness
or
mustiness
the
taste
was
a
blend
of
chocolate
licorice
espresso
and
sweet
malt
along
with
a
faint
bitterness
the
beer
overall
was
rather
bittersweet
and
reminesent
of
bakers
chocolate
at
first
impression
the
flavors
seemed
a
little
clashing
but
after
a
few
sips
it
blends
more
nicely
and
makes
the
beer
much
more
drinkable
than
many
porters
ive
had
tasty
i
keep
this
one
in
the
fridge
all
the
time
it
always
hits
the
spot

roasty

is

with
the

very
well
with
the

and
ending
with
a
subtle
dryness
in
the
back
of

a

offering
from

the
trade
pours
a
relatively
dense
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
thin
beige
head
thin
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
is
roasty
with
cocoa
coffee
and
chocolate
mediumbodied
and
rather
robust
for
a
porter
flavors
of
chocolate
coffee
and
malt
dominate
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
flip
side
the
finish
is
smooth
almost
creamy
at
times
with
a
lightly
hopped
flavor
and
even
a
bit
a
spice
overall
a
nicely
done
porter
a
decent
beer
but
the
dominance
of
the
roastedbitter
flavors
throws
off
the
balance
this
pours
out
black
with
slight
reddish
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
and
a
quick
forming
monstrous
tall
rocky
beige
head
that
peaks
over
the
glass
this
drops
to
a
small
quarter
inch
head
leaving
a
smattering
of
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
on
this
is
heavy
with
smokiness
and
roasted
malt
with
coffee
being
the
strongest
scent
and
chocolate
playing
a
background
role
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
as
roasted
malts
fill
the
palate
and
flavors
of
chocolate
coffee
and
a
slight
earthy
hop
taste
come
out
as
well
very
balanced
taste
and
a
good
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
less
than
expected
but
well
carbonated
and
creamy
pretty
good
drinkability
as
this
has
a
solid
taste
and
is
not
over
the
top
in
any
areas
good
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
porter

touch
of

this
porter
is

extremely
smooth

a

robust
with
roastiness

soothes
the
palate
very
nice
touch
of

with

smacking
the
nostrils
quite
nicely

was

lightly
sweet
on
the

that
smoothly
transitioned
to
a
roasty
malt
finish
with
a
slight
hop
presence
mouthfeel
was
crisp
with
excellent
carbonation
that
helped
carry
the
flavors
drinkability
was
excellent
went
down
smooth
and
easy

drink

very
quickly
smells
malty
and
sweet
but
nothing
very
strong
taste
is
decent
no
complaints
but
nothing
stands
out
either
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
im
not
sure
why
this
beer
is
rated
as
high
as
it
is
its
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
bully
porter
is
close
to
great
and
a
bigger

presence
would
inch
it
closer

still
highly

take
a

then

through

afterwards
it
warms

like

truly
an
aftertaste
to
savor
mmm
strong
work
boulevard
kudos
my
final
beer
to
try
from
boulevard
proves
to
be
a
good
one
like
all
the
others
i
sampled
i
thought
this
was
a
mere
toss
in
hugey
this
is
the
player
to
be
named
later
that
became
a
superstar
many
thanks
as
for
drinkability
i
can
say
im
on
my
4th
tonight
but
seriously
it
tastes
robust
but
it
goes
down
easy
enough
to
drink
a
few
at
a
time
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
boulevard
after
reviewing
their
unfiltered
wheat
which
i
really
like
but
was
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
earlier
tonight
but
this
restores
my
faith
in
them
this
is
a
great
reason
to
continue
to
support
my
local
brewer
bully
a
well
made
beer
though
i
am
stuck
on
their
more
drinkable
pale
ale
for
every
day
use
honestly
for
some
reason
i
find
most
stouts
to
be
more
drinkable
than
porters

better
than
ever
its
great
to
know
that
a
major
craft
brewery
like
boulevard
is
willing
to
evaluate
and
improve
their
products
continually
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
is
rich
in
black
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
a
bit
too
intense
with
its
blackness
it
has
a
lingering
roasted
flavor
it
goes
down
creamy
but
finishes
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
slightly
above
average
look
i
like
the
dark
beers
as
much
as
anyone
but
what
is
too
much
darkness
this
beer
pushes
the
envelope
a
bully
good
show
to
bighuge
for
this
one
great
porter
pours

with
a
healthy
sandy

that
lingers
at
a
fairly
thick
level

laces
the
glass
heavily
chocolate
and
some
unidentifiable
fruit
in
the
aroma
almost
figs
but
not
quite
almost
pear
but
not
quite
a
bit
of
spice
from
the
hops
nice
balance
here
in
the
flavor
not
all
that
sweet
but
good
cocoa
powder
that
fruit
again
a
little
caramel
and
some
other
malty
flavors
a
faint
bitterness
comes
up
in
the
fairly
short
finish
the
mouthfeels
suprisingly
creamy
from
the
carbonation

final
thoughts
a
bit
of
a
variation
from
what
i
normally
drink
but
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
purchased
solely
because
it
was
a
boulevard
product
i
have
had
few
beers
to
compare
this
to
and
am
somewhat
unfamiliar
with
the
style
at
this
time
but
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
and
will
purchase
again
thanks
to
bditty
for
letting
me
try
this
one
out
this
is
a
dark

aromas
are
classic
porter
dark
chocolate
roasted
and
caramel
malts
citrusy
piney
and
flortal
cascase
and
centennial
hops
the
taste
is
balanced

sheer
perfection
chocolate
caramel
hops
malts
alcohol
it
is
all
here
but
these
flavors
blend
together
so
well
its
like
a
magic
trick
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
not
too
thick
nor
too
thin
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
quite
lovely
and
one
of
the
quintessential
porters

there

part
of
the

this

is

dark

color
it
also
has
a
good
strong
tan
head
there
is
a
decent
aroma
of
hops
to
it
somewhat
more
than
you
would
expect
in
a
porter
good
strong
body
of
roastiness
chocolate
and
some
coffee
good
taste
of
hoppiness
to
it
i
like
this
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
mahogany
ruby
color
that
when
held
to
the
light
was
well
carbonated
i
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
clarity
dt
the
conditioning
method
the
head
that
was
produced
was
when
first
poured
thick
rich
and
creamy
then
slowly
fell
with
each
sip
but
stayed
a
good
way
to
about
left
in
the
glass
the
color
was
a
medium
beige
light
mild
chocolate
color
some
lace
was
created
but
in
patches
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
sweet
malt
some
roasted
malt
fresh
hops
burnt
coffee
no
cream
and
milk
chocolate
not
the
strongest
aromas
that
i
have
had
from
a
porter
when
first
served
but
when
it
rose
a
few
degrees
the
nose
really
improved
the
flavors
were
of
coffee
fresh
hops
chicory
burnt
chocolate
bitter
chocolate
hints
of
fruit
emerged
a
light
nut
and
some
grain
barley
the
after
taste
was
of
burnt
coffee
and
hops
the
body
was
light
medium
to
medium
i
would
have
liked
to
have
more
feel
in
a
beer
like
this
personally
and
was
surprised
at
the
body
on
this
one
a
very
enjoyable
beer
good
all
the
way
around
once
the
temperature
rose
a
few
from
the
refrigeration
only
complaint
would
be
more
body
but
all
and
all
a
good
example
of
its
style
taste
is
a
bit
more
complex
then
the
smell
with
a
hefty
almost
chewy
amount
of
roasted
malts
giving
it
a
over
baked
slightly
burnt
cookie
sense
with
mild
milk
chocolate
and
a
slight
coffee
flavor
appearing
late
and
the
drying
sense
from
the
coffee
and
chocolate
showing
up
even
later
quite
a
nice
finish
overall
very
smooth
and
easy
with
a
light
milding
amount
of
bittering
hops
and
just
the
right
amount
of
taste
and
flavors
to
make
you
take
notice
feel
is
medium
bodied
starts
a
little
weak
but
picks
up
nicely
and
finishes
with
a
genuine
porter
quality
late
finish
that
i
like
its
not
as
sweet
or
as
bold
as
some
porters
but
its
respectable
very
drinkable
as
well
reasonably
solid
porter
edit
had
this
aging
in
my
cellar
for
six
months
delicious
made
slight
adjustment
to
show
i
love
this
porter
though
it
was
still
a
little
thin
the
aging
took
some
of
the
bite
out
of
it
smooth
tasting
reveals
a
bold
chocolate
and
peat
experience
the
combinations
of
malts
provide
a
somewhat
unique
porter
experience
with
enough
body
for
another
beer
a
very
dry
aftertaste
and
somewhat
roasted
flavor
illicit
a
call
for
more
very
nice
porter
one
of
the
better
samples
of
the
style
very
dark
brown
slight
light
transmission
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
bright
ochrecolored
12
inch
head
thats
pillowy
and
retains
extremely
well
nice
lace
as
well
slightly
oily
mink
oil
aroma
similar
to
a
sierra
nevada
stout
lighter
bodied
than
the
color
suggests
slighlty
malty
light
coffee
and
more
than
average
carbonation
respectably
hopped
but
less
peppery
than
a
summit
great
northern
all
in
all
not
a
bad
entry
more
gutsy
than
many
sweet
examples
but
lacking
in
body
and
that
one
outstanding
note
or
quality
that
makes
me
loyal
to
some
beers
somewhat
dissappointing
its
a
very
attractive
brew
that
holds
onto
its
head
like
grim
death
all
the
way
down
the
pint
glass
orginally
sampled
on
3
december
2002
this
is
a
very
nice
porter
it
has
almost
a
chocolate
like
smell
w
lots
of
roasty
characteristics
thoroughly
enjoyable
it
should
be
no
surprise
to
anyone
that
the
color
of
this
porter
is
dark
brownblackish
were
you
expecting
something
fizzy
yellow
nice
creamy
tasting
i
could
very
well
drink
more
this
is
a
very
good
porter
and
i
wish
it
was
available
here
in
ny
12
oz
bottle
great
label
with
the
monocle
using

inspecting
a
pint
of

shiny

color
with
a
full
bubbly
rocking
khaki
color
moderate
smells
of
roasted
coffee
burnt
toast
and
just
the
right
cocoa
smoothness
taste
is
right
on
for
the
style
nice
bitter
chocolate
roastedness
bitterness
is
sharp
at
the
finish
and
lingers
somewhat
maybe
a
touch
thin
for
a
porter
and
highly
charged
carbonation
the
flavors
more
than
make
up
for
it
very
enjoyable
porter
both
marc77
and
bditty
187
sent
this
to
me
so
i
give
out
dual
hearty
thanks
to
these
fine
bas
ive
had
this
beer
oh
so
many
times
before
but
had
never
sat
down
to
one
with
the
intention
of
reviewing
it
and
picking
it
apart
i
have
always
enjoyed
it
but
now
i
appreciate
it
even
more
this
is
probably
the
best
brew
of
all
the
boulevard
beers
that
i
have
had
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
hue
around
the
edges
a
very
foamy
cream
colored
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
to
say
it
had
good
lacing
is
an
understatement
the
sheets
of
foam
completely
covered
the
walls
of
the
glass
i
love
it
when
there
is
still
some
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
roasted
malts
dominates
the
smell
with
a
hints
of
chocolate
and
some
alcohol
aroma
taste
is
mostly
of
roasted
malts
up
front
with
a
lite
bittery
finish
that
balances
this
brew
perfectly
the
last
few
gulps
are
the
best
with
the
yeast
collected
at
the
bottom
will
definately
purchase
again
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
porter
this
is
a
fairly
filling
beer
for
me
so
i
often
end
the
evening
with
a
bottle
its
not
a
light
guzzle
anytime
beer
by
any
means
a
tasty
beer
very
drinkable
this
porter
was
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
soso
but
everything
seemed
in
order
for
a
good
porter
poured
a
dark
brown
offwhite
head
initial
sip
was
very
mild
mouthfeel
is
decent
though
the
carbonation
was
a
little
bit
too
much
tasted
like
a
mild
blend
of
maltiness
with
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
very
good
beer
for
relaxing
with
a
couple
doesnt
take
long
to
get
to
the
great
tasting
bottom
of
the
glass
very
good
porter
for
a
novice
like
me
to
get
into
the
darker
beers
on
the
market
the
color
is
deep
brown
to
black
and
the
head
is
voluminous
and
frothy
in
its
textures
as
it
dissipates
it
leaves
a
trail
of
fine
lace
to
cover
the
glass
nose
that
of
roasted
barley
that
is
slightly
spicy
with
malt
and
hints
of
semisweet
chocolate
the
first
sip
is
sweet
the
top
is
middling
in
feel
and
the
finish
is
perkily
hopped
the
carbonation
moderate
one
of
the
better
porters
i
tasted
recently
and
a
pleasure
for
a
lover
of
the
dark
side
12
oz
bottle
dark

color
nice
creamy

roasted
coffee
aroma
light
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
medium
body
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
a
good
tasting
porter
but
not
as
strong
as
i
like
bully
porter
is
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
and
frankly
this
beer
merits
more
reviews
this
is
boulevards
best
brew
i
recommend
it
this
brew
presents
with
a
deep
brown
color
but
absolutely
no
head
retention
the
aroma
is
predominantly
of
roasted
malt
with
just
a
brush
of
chocolate
the
body
is
decent
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
the
hop
profile
is
also
quite
aggressive
the
best
of
the
boulevard
beers
ive
had
dark
brown
almost
black
big
creamy
tan
head
cocoa
beans
and
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
dry
mouthfeel
dark
cocoa
like
flavor
whe
burnt
malts
good
hopping
in
this
one
finishes
dry
pretty
creamy
medium
bodied
very
good
overall
nice
very
deep
brownblack
color
and
solid
tan
head
that
leaves
some
good
belgianlace
about
the
glass
the
aroma
is
limited
but
thats
ok
for
porter
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
rich
with
malt
and
intense
roasted
barley
theres
a
flash
of
sharp
hop
flavor
in
the
middle
cascades
but
its
covered
over
by
the
roastiness
before
the
swallow
is
through
the
finish
is
dry
and
roasty
revealing
a
little
bit
more
of
the
hops
seemingly
lasting
forever
very
nice
indeed
a
nice
big
creamy
brown
head
tops
this
opaque
brew
it
has
great
retention
too
forming
craters
as
it
ever
so
slowly
fades
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
java
and
west
coast
style
hops
the
taste
is
similar
however
burnt
malt
and
anise
also
seem
to
make
fleeting
appearances
in
addtion
to
the
bitter
hops
and
chocolate
malt
this
is
a
nice
tasting
porter
the
body
is
just
a
little
too
think
about
medium
to
mediumfull
the
bitterness
and
hop
qualities
here
really
appeal
to
me
similar
to
sn
solid
porter
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
would
have
expected
a
porter
to
be
none
the
less
i
am
impressed
and
you
will
be
too
the
tan
head
dissipates
quickly
deep
garnet
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
when
held
to
light
its
a
porter
haze
is
not
an
issue
the
sweet
and
toffee
like
dark
crystal
malt
hit
the
nose
at
first
and
are
ensued
by
a
mild
chocolate
malt
and
burnt
black
patent
aroma
the
hop
nose
is
all
willamette
a
seedless
american
grown
fuggle
and
is
quite
similar
to
that
of
sierra
nevada
porter
although
crystal
malt
sweetness
is
fairly
high
black
patent
bitterness
along
with
ample
hop
bitterness
provide
balance
the
finish
is
very
dry
compared
to
other
microbrewed
porters
and
a
clean
combination
of
roasted
grain
and
hop
bitterness
lingers
its
a
flavorful
porter
for
sure
but
i
wouldve
personally
appreciated
more
body
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
no
there
is
not
enough
for
me
to
recommend
it
first
of
all
this
is
not
a
porter
its
an
imitation
of
it
second
is
a
bit
watery
at
48
abv
its
very
light
wish
it
could
be
around
6
or
7
abv
but
if
you
are
in
a
bar
and
wanna
try
a
dark
ale
and
this
is
the
only
option
why
not
give
it
a
try
o
if
you
like
myself
are
into
craft
beers
and
are
thinking
about
picking
this
brew
up
dont
be
turned
off
by
the
fact
that
rickards
is
ownedmade
by
molson
coors
from
what
ive
tasted
so
far
the
rickards
line
is
far
superior
to
its
macrobrewed
brethren
in
every
single
aspect
rickards
dark
is
no
exception
it
offers
a
beautiful
glassful
of
goodness
that
is
incredibly
sessionablelike
any
good
porter
should
be
do
yourself
a
favor
now
and
pick
up
a
rickards
taster
pack
like
i
did
and
i
am
willing
to
bet
that
you
wont
be
disappointing
with
a
majority
of
the
rickards
line
definitely
not
like
any
porter
ive
had
before
this
ale
pours
more
of
a
caramel
colour
than
a
solid
black
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
goes
away
smells
of
dark
bread
and
noble
hops
taste
is
sweet
at
first
with
a
finishing
bitterness
of
hops
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
carbonated
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
one
either
o
not
at
all
to
porter
style
a
mediocre
overly
sweet
brown
ale
that
doesnt
really
come
together
fetched
a
bottle
from
a
rickards
mixed
pack
along
with
a
blonde
i
used
to
drink
a
fair
quantity
of
rickards
and
this
was
probably
my
favorite
of
the
brood
a
brew
that
satisfied
my
craving
for
dark
beers
long
before
i
really
knew
anything
about
dark
beers
returning
to
it
now
was
prompted
by
a
semisober
quaff
at
a
halloween
party
and
my
managing
to
recall
that
there
were
some
mellow
pleasant
caramel
flavors
lurking
in
there
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
that
sorta
evokes
a
porter
but
really
not
much
else
about
this
beer
does
its
a
dark
mild
or
brown
ale
evaluation
solely
on
the
basis
of
style
guidelines
is
therefore
unfair
although
one
can
fault
molson
for
marketing
the
beer
as
something
its
not
blonde
at
least
lands
in
the
german
pilsener
ballpark
dark
is
pretty
foamy
probably
around
three
inches
of
light
tan
head
and
has
a
thinnish
watery
body
that
clashes
with
ones
expectations
aroma
is
mild
i
get
roasted
malt
light
toffee
maybe
a
little
fruit
like
baked
apple
i
do
not
smell
or
taste
much
in
the
way
of
maple
which
is
probably
just
as
well
palate
is
light
carameltoffee
along
with
dry
nuts
and
a
roasted
bitterness
like
weak
cold
coffee
and
what
i
swear
is
a
light
fruity
note
almost
citrus
in
character
hmmm
could
be
hops
has
the
malty
tang
that
one
gets
from
brown
ales
and
yes
porters
i
also
get
a
little
cardboard
or
some
other
papery
notes
a
signature
rickards
offflavor
along
with
metal
make
no
mistake
though
the
whole
package
is
downplayed
and
falls
well
short
of
robust
the
pleasant
lingering
caramel
that
i
recalled
from
the
aforementioned
party
was
indeed
present
again
and
is
a
redeeming
feature
if
you
shed
your
expectations
and
view
this
as
a
mild
or
brown
rather
than
a
porter
its
not
too
bad
if
a
little
unsophisticated
overall
definitely
not
a
porter
but
a
nice
brown
ale
partially
of
what
the
style
should
be
but
expecting
more
of
the
style
overall
more
like
a
mild
english
ale
so
keeping
the
style
in
mind
this
score
is
a
bit
lower
than
it
would
be
otherwise
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
most
impressive
from
rickards
and
only
fair
as
a
porter
almost
a
clear
filtered
deep
mahogany
brown
hue
with
a
big
khaki
tan
head
big
bubbles
form
thick
mild
hints
of
coffee
they
mentioned
a
touch
of
maple
syrup
added
in
here
mild
cocoa
very
pleasant
mass
produced
porter
flavors
meld
nicely
a
hint
of
cherry
or
other
dark
fruits
mild
cocoa
hints
of
maple
syrup
without
coming
off
too
sweet
a
bit
watery
maybe
i
wish
there
were
more
substantial
flavors
but
for
something
from
rickards
aka
molson
its
pretty
enjoyable
and
effortless
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
range
with
even
carbonation
nothing
cloying
on
the
palate
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
hangs
around
between
sips
overall
im
glad
my
cousin
shared
his
sampler
of
the
rickards
12
pack
he
got
coming
back
from
canada
he
happened
to
drink
all
of
the
rickards
blonde
happy
to
try
the
white
and
dark
and
revisit
the
red
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
think
this
stuff
was
good
beer
i
like
porters
in
general
so
that
compels
me
to
give
a
nice
overall
mark
not
as
good
as
other
porters
and
darks
ive
had
so
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
this
dark
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
but
i
would
think
given
that
it
would
pair
with
food
very
well
i
think
it
would
enhance
the
food
and
thus
enhance
itself
some
a
decent
mass
produced
english
style
porter
not
much
to
speak
of
in
terms
of
complexity
or
flavours
but
its
not
horrible
either
most
bars
i
go
to
frequently
dont
have
any
dark
beers
or
porters
even
guinness
isnt
available
at
most
of
them
other
than
this
beer
so
for
fans
of
this
style
dont
have
much
of
a
choice
but
that
being
said
its
not
that
bad
just
nothing
special
at
all
its
drinkable
but
there
are
much
better
stouts
available
overall
35
for
a
macro
brewer
kicking
out
pseudo
craft
offerings
this
isnt
too
bad
it
just
needs
to
be
properly
labeled
final
thoughts
its
a
good
beer
but
its
not
a
porter
why
on
earth
molson
thought
calling
this
a
porter
on
their
website
was
a
good
idea
i
have
no
idea
probably
because
a
porter
is
more
marketable
then
a
mild
dark
i
dunno
either
way
as
a
mild
dark
just
about
every
category
would
have
received
a
5
bump
from
me
which
would
have
pushed
this
beer
around
the
4
0
area
i
like
to
think
the
brewer
intended
it
as
such
and
not
as
a
porter
but
i
suppose
this
should
be
a
lesson
in
knowing
what
you
are
selling
you
would
think
that
molson
would
have
learned
a
lesson
from
its
rival
labatt
and
their
venture
with
alexander
keiths
stag
head
stout
o
soso
certainly
doesnt
seem
like
much
of
a
porter
more
like
a
watereddown
brown
ale
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
caramel
roast
and
a
mellow
lager
note
in
the
taste
a
small
sweet
caramel
roast
in
a
lager
like
beer
a
small
bite
but
mainly
smooth
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
note
of
caramel
in
a
lager
a
sweet
caramel
roast
in
a
lager
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
porter
it
is
really
thin
rickards
is
a
bit
of
a
standby
for
beer
fans
in
ontario
stuck
gonig
to
chain
restaurants
and
bars
the
dark
is
a
not
bad
addition
to
the
lineup
id
happily
drink
one
given
no
other
options
very
good
for
the
style
a
traditional
english
porter
i
poured
it
with
a
big
fluffycreamy
light
brown
head
it
reduced
to
a
thin
head
with
lacing
along
the
sides
the
body
is
clear
with
a
dark
brownred
colour
on
the
aroma
i
get
rootbeer
and
roasted
grains
though
it
isnt
particularly
strong
the
taste
isnt
really
really
i
expected
i
taste
licorce
molassas
and
smoke
it
is
supposed
to
have
a
hint
of
pure
quebec
maple
syrup
but
i
dont
get
it
makes
me
wonder
what
it
would
taste
like
without
that
ingredient
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
watery
with
a
thin
body
overall
it
tastes
basically
what
id
expect
a
rickards
porter
to
taste
like
o
this
was
my
first
porter
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
i
can
tell
this
is
an
average
offering
of
the
style
it
does
however
leave
me
wanting
to
try
more
porters
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
no
more
a
real
porter
than
that
person
sending
you
the
emails
about
viagra
is
a
real
doctor
and
if
youre
looking
for
a
substantial
malty
dark
ale
then
id
say
its
also
every
bit
a
scam
dont
get
me
wrong
it
may
be
the
most
flavorful
offering
in
the
molson
lineup
and
isnt
too
hard
to
drink
but
lets
just
not
call
it
a
porter
and
keep
expectations
reasonable
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavors
and
aromas
deep
copper
in
colour
like
an
old
penny
offwhite
head
disappears
in
under
two
minutes
no
lacing
aroma
smells
sweet
light
prune
notes
very
meek
and
inoffensive
what
little
aroma
to
be
found
is
more
like
brown
ale
than
porter
mild
dried
fruit
flavour
with
even
milder
nearly
nonexistent
roast
slight
acidity
mediumbodied
but
slightly
overcarbonated
for
my
liking
not
as
horrifying
an
abomination
as
keiths
dark
ill
damn
it
with
that
faint
praise
altogether
it
is
alright
but
as
a
porter
fan
there
are
several
better
options
overallagain
this
feels
more
like
a
gimmick
and
its
a
largely
forgettable
beer
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
do
not
recommend
seeking
it
out
went
ok
with
my
meal
though
even
freeits
hard
to
drink
a
beer
when
the
can
proudly
states
the
molsoncoors
provenance
final

a
c
o
i
personally
dont
understand
why
rickards
is
slammed
so
much
no
this
is
not
the
best
porter
out
there
but
there
is
some
flavor
and
its
easy
to
drink
especially
in
the
warmer
weather
i
think
this
would
also
make
a
great
steak
marinade
and
will
try
that
sometime
down
the
road
i
would
buy
this
again
the
rickards
lineup
and
this
in
particular
is
decent
beer
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
d
its
a
soso
commercial
porter
since
few
really
put
that
style
out
there
but
i
know
i
have
made
one
much
better
pours
mahogany
with
some
chestnut
and
ruby
highlights
found
in
the
body
relatively
creamy
head
that
lasts
and
laces
quite
well
is
this
a
molson
product
nose
has
some
nondescript
sweetness
maybe
some
maplesugar
and
a
hint
of
some
nuttiness
muddled
and
too
sweet
not
much
else
some
grain
and
a
hint
of
metal
taste
has
some
dark
fruit
and
some
sweetness
some
sugar
fro
sure
but
definitely
not
the
maple
advertised
on
the
can
more
metallic
notes
in
the
finish
body
is
light
and
borders
on
watery
medium
carbonation
this
one
was
just
too
sweet
for
me
and
not
something
id
intentionally
revisit
not
horrible
and
a
step
up
from
other
macro
offerings
but
not
work
seeking
out
tasted
decent
when
cold
held
some
porter
qualities
some
roasted
dark
malt
character
a
bit
of
maple
syrup
which
is
said
its
brewed
with
but
it
lacks
any
body
and
true
quality
ingrediants
seems
like
it
was
brewed
with
little
to
no
thought
about
quality
but
rather
with
quantity
in
mind
light
and
thin
mouthfeel
wasnt
going
to
say
no
to
my
buddy
decent
overall
but
not
going
to
ever
purchase
myself
overall
its
alright
i
kind
of
like
it
and
might
drink
it
again
but
there
are
better
beers
in
this
style
that
are
easy
to
get
and
not
much
more
expensive
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
despite
what
others
may
say
it
is
easily
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
the
maple
taste
is
a
bit
forthcomming
though
i
find
that
the
beer
is
lacking
somethng
though
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
oh
well
ill
just
st
back
and
enjoy
it
i
guess
overall
this
is
a
decent
attempt
starts
strong
but
the
lightness
kills
it
and
makes
it
an
unballanced
beer
but
i
still
think
the
bottle
version
is
pretty
damn
good
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
not
the
best
there
is
but
acceptable
for
sure
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
an
english
porter
at
all
d
by
no
means
a
terrible
offering
but
lacking
a
bit
of
everything
in
all
departments
would
easily
order
a
pint
of
this
again
but
its
nothing
special
a
poor
example
of
the
style
but
still
a
drinkable
dark
beer
clear
dark
brown
still
quite
transparent
a
thin
beige
cap
appeared
but
didnt
linger
for
long
it
did
leave
a
modest
collar
and
a
bit
of
short
lived
spotty
lace
light
aroma
mostly
of
caramel
and
toffee
light
roast
and
burnt
sugar
molasses
with
a
hint
of
smoke
sweet
malty
flavour
more
caramel
light
bitterness
and
roast
towards
the
end
not
much
in
the
way
of
maple
other
than
sugary
sweetness
decent
texture
between
light
and
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
uninspired
but
still
drinkable
and
not
much
of
a
porter
poured
from
the
can
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
its
a
crystal
clear
dark
brown
mahogany
more
brown
ale
than
porter
in
color
with
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
that
recedes
but
manages
some
slight
retention
aroma
is
of
very
slight
roastiness
perhaps
im
imagining
it
and
a
ton
of
caramel
malt
taste
is
more
of
the
heavy
caramel
malt
with
a
super
ridiculous
sweet
finish
the
can
reads
smooth
finish
that
holds
just
a
hint
of
quebec
maple
syrup
more
like
a
friggin
boatload
of
maple
syrup
this
stuff
is
so
sweet
with
absolutely
zero
hop
character
its
very
tough
to
drink
all
473ml
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
kinda
creamy
drinkability
no
thanks
drink
just
an
okay
beer
there
are
much
better
darks
out
there
to
be
drunk
mouthfeel
save
the
fact
there
is
vomit
mixed
with
the
beer
very
strong
carbonation
drinkability
take
a
guess
bottle
poured
a
clear
medium
brown
color
ale
with
a
fizzy
small
head
with
minimal
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
light
roasted
malt
with
no
bitterness
and
lightly
sweet
adjunct
dominated
malt
profile
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
light
caramel
with
faint
roasted
malt
body
is
way
too
thin
for
style
with
medium
carbonation
pointless
thin
weak
uninspired
poor
representation
of
the
style
basically
disappointing
and
pointless
rickards
dark
poured
black
like
other
porters
and
had
almost
no
head
there
wasnt
much
of
a
smell
and
the
taste
was
the
same
it
was
very
light
and
tasted
watered
down
even
though
it
was
a
porter
it
was
very
light
and
needed
much
more
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
beer
either
overall
not
the
worst
accompaniment
to
a
5napkin
restoburger
when
youre
not
trying
too
hard
to
think
about
it
another
sidestep
from
their
red
ale
template
yup
average
brown
ale
sure
english
porter
hell
to
the
no
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
too
high
for
me
wow
i
would
like
to
meet
the
geniuses
who
thought
this
one
up
hey
rickard
take
off
you
hoser
like
most
above
average
macros
rickards
dark
would
be
a
good
fallback
beer
in
mainstream
establishments
certainly
one
of
molsons
best
beers
and
comparable
to
the
white
but
thats
not
saying
much
acceptable
in
moments
of
desperation
forgettable
if
you
want
something
interesting

roasted

a

creamy
sweet
finish
good
if
this
was
on
tap
vs
kokanee
or
canadian
then
it
is
certainly
more
drinkable
might
be
a
decent
brew
to
offer
newbies
who
are
afraid
or
dont
like
dark
beers
drinkability
easy
to
put
away
quite
a
few
and
the
lower
alcohol
content
is
a
bonus
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
rickards
line
like
the
rest
of
the
rickards
this
is
a
pretty
bland
brew
doesnt
have
the
presence
of
a
proper
porter
weak
kneed
across
the
board
in
its
aroma
and
flavour
thin
bodied
just
uninteresting
but
not
unpalatable
meh
im
not
kidding
d
easy
enough
to
drink
has
more
character
than
most
molson
products
not
sure
why
it
would
qualify
as
a
porter
though
this
is
so
far
from
a
porter
very
much
a
safe
beer
non
offensive
but
does
have
some
very
nice
maply
syrup
tasting
notes
dark
brown
in
colour
and
not
a
lot
of
aroma
but
aroma
is
sweet
with
maple
taste
is
again
maple
syrup
with
some
malt
beer
is
an
easy
drinking
macro
with
really
nothing
of
note
or
notable
characteristics
for
a
big
name
canadian
brand
its
ok
but
thats
not
saying
much
this
beer
paired
very
well
with
my
pulled
pork
sandwich
very
medium
with
a
lingering
toasty
taste
refreshing
crisp
would
acquire
again
a
good
porter
twelve
ounce
bottle
clear
dark
brown
with
a
light
n
brown
head
good
lacing
nose
has
molasses
dark

yeast
taste
is
rich
with
malt
and
molasses
fruity

flows
into
mild
hoppiness
a
bit
of
mineral
no
alcohol
anywhere
smooth
full
carbonation
with
moderate
weight
one
of
my
my
favorite
porters
this
is
a
fairly
strong
dark
porter
with
a
nice
rugged
brownish
head
and
good
lacing
i
liked
the
maltiness
and
full
body
not
a
bad
choice
served
on
tap
for
valentines
day
and
on
presidents
day
weekend
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
o
not
as
unique
as
deep
six
but
more
refreshing
solid
and
enjoyable
allaround
on
draft
at
the
landings
in
new
hope
pa
nice
porter
pours
a
nice
dark
colors
with
a
cinger
head
that
fades
some
leaves
some
nice
lacing
overall
a
nice
drinkable
porter
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
taste
tasted
almost
like
somebody
poured
a
shot
of
whiskey
in
my
beer
had
the
other
2
revolutionary
ales
and
this
was
by
far
the
worst
one
usually
love
yards
beer
but
this
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
from
the
molasses
almost
as
sweet
as
a
milk
stout
notes
of
coffee
on
the
palate
but
the
sweet
chocolate
predominates
drinks
like
a
light
milk
stout
the
finish
is
bitter
dark
chocolate
no
wonder
we
won
the
war
taste
a
solid
malt
and
porter
taste
with
lots
of
coffee
some
chocolate
im
naive
about
how
some
of
these
porters
are
made
but
i
wont
be
surprised
if
a
dark
coffee
is
blended
in
with
this
porter
my
experience
with
porters
is
limited
but
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
with
this
one
as
it
appears
to
try
too
hard
to
be
a
porter
i
hope
that
makes
sense
o
other
porters
i
have
had
are
either
too
strong
in
the
coffee
chocolate
and
other
complex
flavors
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
has
more
simple
flavors
than
many
other
porters
but
this
beer
still
has
a
delicious
balance
of
more
simple
ingredients
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
but
still
tasty
o
this
is
quite
a
nice
porter
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
doesnt
want
the
chewy
flavor
and
mouthfeel
of
a
stout
its
essentially
a
mini
stout
good
complex
flavor
in
the
malt
and
nice
balance
that
leans
toward
the
malty
side
i
last
had
this
in
2008
and
dont
remember
the
circumstances
but
i
will
upgrade
the
rating
in
my
database
this
is
a
very
pleasant
porter
with
a
definite
molasses
flavor
and
sweetness
but
is
not
cloying
the
appearance
is
enticing
the
aroma
is
weak
and
the
flavor
and
palate
are
very
good
overall
a
good
wellrounded
porter
that
i
enjoyed
o
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
porter
with
a
slight
muskiness
reminiscent
of
oldtime
taverns
or
am
i
just
imagining
the
latter
no
and
i
like
it
overall
excellent
highly
recommended
o
i
cannot
tell
a
lie
this
is
a
fine
porter
its
not
up
there
in
the
elite
tier
by
any
means
but
its
certainly
not
gross
either
personally
i
think
its
a
bit
too
licoricey
oh
well
still
worth
trying
overall
a
decent
porter
that
is
not
complex
but
has
a
good
flavor
would
not
seek
out
again
but
glad
i
tried
based
on
how
much
i
liked
the
chocolate
love
stout
from
the
same
brewery
pours
a
deep
brown
possibly
black
no
light
gets
through
to
be
able
to
tell
it
has
a
moderate
tan
head
that
has
almost
no
retention
but
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
with
some
dark
roast
notes
and
a
little
hint
of
alcohol
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
roast
forward
with
just
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
there
is
a
little
silkiness
to
the
mouthfeel
and
a
slightly
lighter
weight
to
the
body
an
aboveaverage
porter
from
the
first
president
o
this
is
a
great
porter
and
a
great
beer
i
like
to
believe
that
george
washington
would
have
been
drinking
something
very
close
to
this
i
love
weirdold
stuff
like
this
i
mean
dfhs
ancient
ale
series
got
me
into
beer
this
has
me
very
excited
to
try
the
other
two
ales
of
the
revolution
deep
brown
in
color
with
good
clarity
youll
need
a
bright
light
of
course
poured
with
a
short

foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
roasted

and

to

at
the
end
as
this

crisp
and
dry
outstanding

is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
is
a
standout
perfect
porter
profile
sweet

notes
subtle

profile
nice
head
and
great
finish
try
this
beer
its
a
greatnay
the
best
porter
in
pa
i
would
put
this
up
against
founders
and
great
lakes
for
the
best
representation
of
the
style
i
am
glad
i
bought
this
case
i
will
be
savoring
it
this
winter
o
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
has
an
interesting
mix
of
aromas
and
flavors
o
pretty
good
beer
all
around
prost
note
this
beer
was

at
the
yards

kickass
beer
why
was
is
so
hard
for
them
to
evidence
the
goodness
in
the
aroma
a
fault
is
a
fault
but
its
still
a
4
its
interesting
and
different
than
most
of
the
american
porters
ive
had
recently
perhaps
its
a
reflection
of
the
english
porter
style
its
not
as
roasty
or
chocolatey
as
it
is
straight
up
sweet
with
molasses
and
toffee
it
has
a
little
more
in
common
with
barleywines
than
it
does
stouts
indeed
i
wont
try
this
one
again
but
it
was
definitely
an
interesting
change
of
pace
for
porters
great
beer
and
happy
to
have
had
it
this
ale
drank
better
than
all
of
the
others
of
this
beer
i
drank
out
of
this
case
this
is
my
last
one
im
sure
that
it
is
because
im
actually
thinking
about
it
and
not
hitting
several
up
with
friends
and
catching
a
buzz
but
this
isnt
too
bad
of
a
porter
at
all
a
pretty
respectable
beer
from
yards
who
i
am
not
usually
overly
impressed
with
overall
great
porter
very
close
to
a
stout
best
if
you
enjoy
a
combination
both
strong
hops
and
malts
one
of
my
favorite
porters
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
style
and
unique
at
the
same
time
porters
are
always
underappreciated
even
better
brew
on
cask
or
at
the
brewery
overall
a
very
nice
mild
english
porter
apparently
washington
had
this
brewed
for
his
troops
hope
they
were
as
pleased
with
it
as
i
was
even
though
im
british
overall
damn
this
is
a
great
beer
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
in
fact
according
to
yards
this
beer
was
created
using
george
washingtons
own
recipe
if
thats
accurate
our
im
american
first
president
made
a
damn
great
beer
im
continuing
to
be
impressed
with
the
yards
brewing
company
id
love
to
see
what
the
bourbon
barrelaged
version
of
this
beer
is
like
overall
this
was
a
nice
porter
that
definitely
has
some
qualities
of
that
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
this
one
stands
out
and
ill
definitely
try
this
one
again

very
smooth
really
good
porter
a
deep
thick
black
appearance
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
settles
a
bit
but
holds
on
for
a
healthy
trail
of
lacing
the
aroma
offers
relatively
mild
malt
with
nuances
of
charcoal
coffee
and
grass
hops
but
relatively
polite
overall
the
flavor
jumps
in
with
smooth
cocoacoffee
and
maybe
a
touch
of
diluted
licorice
impressively
gentle
on
the
palate
yet
offering
a
pleasant
grassy
hop
edge
that
blends
tastefully
i
dont
think
its
too
much
more
complex
than
that
but
this
is
very
solid
and
highly
drinkable
its
medium
bodied
with
a
satiny
smooth
feel
including
delicate
carbonation
very
much
recommended
an
any
time
porter
o
decently
complex
but
traditional
and
full
feeling
good
porter
would
like
to
have
on
tap
for
sure
overall
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
beer
is
world
class
i
think
that
some
may
argue
with
that
assessment
on
the
grounds
that
it
may
be
too
sweet
with
too
much
molasses
or
somehow
doesnt
completely
fit
with
the
grain
bill
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
pretty
broad
category
in
beers
and
allows
for
such
differences
im
going
out
on
a
limb
here
and
calling
this
5
out
of
5
its
so
very
complex
sweet
yet
dry
balanced
with
the
only
hint
of
the
abv
being
the
warming
feeling
in
my
stomach
world
class
o
worth
revisiting
this
a
nice
porter
that
was
easy
to
drink
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
solid
overall
quite
a
delicious
brew
the
flavor
has
lots
of
transitions
with
all
of
them
being
relatively
smooth
and
unabrupt
other
then
the
somewhat
weak
creaminessbody
it
was
quite
a
nice
brew
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
this
is
one
of
the
better
yards
offerings
with
a
nice
feel
and
more
pronounced
flavor
than
some
of
their
other
brews
id
be
curious
to
see
how
the
barrelaged
version
matches
up
solid
porter
with
an
english
feel
in
the
malts
and
yeast
you
can
taste
the
influence
of
great
britain
on
this
early
american
recipe
luckily
we
threw
them
out
and
now
brew
our
own
styles
of
beer
o
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
as
i
have
been
underwhelmed
with
virtually
everything
ive
had
from
yards
but
this
is
pretty
good
o
i
like
many
of
yards
offerings
and
htis
is
another
goodie
a
mild
porter
for
those
who
like
the
dark
malt
flavors
without
a
heavy
bodied
beer
pretty
enjoyable

compliment
this
takes
its

overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
great
deal
more
than
i
thought
i
would
i
read
brewed
with
molasses
on
the
label
i
knew
i
might
be
picking
up
a
bottle
that
was
way
too
sweet
for
my
taste
general
washingtons
tavern
porter
is
a
nicely
balanced
example
of
the
stylearhat
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
overall
a
very
drinkable
porter
not
heavy
at
all
o
my
brother
brought
a
case
of
these
from
pa
for
christmas
a
couple
weeks
later
and
there
are
only
a
few
left
and
i
dont
think
ive
shared
any
more
than
a
bottle
or
two
so
yeah
ive
been
enjoying
this
as
a
pretty
easydrinking
porter
that
packs
a
decent
punch
at
7
abv
o
i
prefer
other
english
porters
like
fullers
and
samuel
smiths
taddy
this
one
wasnt
bad
though
o
while
the
body
could
have
a
bit
more
heft
this
is
a
very
good
porter
the
aroma
is
decent
but
the
beer
shines
in
its
flavor
it
almost
seems
too
sweet
at
first
sip
but
the
bitter
finish
balances
the
beer
nicely
pretty
good
porter
robust
but
not
too
roasted
or
bold
solid
offering
o
this
a
great
porter
and
the
best
beer
i
have
tried
yards
nice
complexity
would
love
try
this
on
cask
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
overall
a

well

d
excellent
given
the
strength
no
wonder
we
won
the
revolution
if
youre
ever
in
a
war
and
one
sides
drinking
this
while
the
other
is
drinking
tea
bet
on
the
side
fueled
by
this
beer
every
time
big
flavor
but
surprisingly
light
body
makes
for
solid
drinkability
much
lighter
than
the
flavor
would
suggest
overall
very
nice
composition
i
love
it
when
a
novelty
beer
delivers
above
and
beyond
expectations
this
whole
series
of
ales
of
the
revolution
are
far
from
gimmicky
and
the
three
ive
tasted
are
each
excellent
in
their
own
way
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
food
and
friends
although
this
is
in
that
pack
it
tastes
nothing
like
the
other
two
this
is
dark
and
a
bit
heavier
although
maintianing
the
median
abv
of
the
group
nothing
is
transparent
when
poured
into
a
glass
and
the
foam
is
white
my
least
favorite
of
the
3
aor
but
can
be
found
on
draught
at
the
city
tavern
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
with
surprisingly
a
smoother
creamier
feel
than
i
recall
the
tap
having
im
not
a
fan
of
overly
carbonated
prickly
porters
and
this
one
was
smooth
and
soft
enough
in
the
mouth
to
be
very
pleasing
a
tasty
solid
porter
another
impressive
item
for
washingtons
resume
the
bottle
states
that
its
color
is
a
deep
garnet
and
i
find
that
i
rather
agree
you
can
see
the
light
coming
through
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
beautiful
color
and
it
has
a
mountainous
pillowy
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
never
fully
receding
aroma
roasted
malt
toffee
vanilla
cream
milk
chocolate
and
perhaps
the
faintest
bit
of
hops
in
the
flavor
i
am
picking
up
coffee
molasses
and
definitely
some
hop
bitterness
in
there
the
beer
coats
the
mouth
very
well
and
tingles
as
it
goes
down
the
abv
is
imperceptible
however
overall
i
would
recommend
this
the
bitterness
to
the
finish
adds
a
ruggedness
to
the
character
of
what
would
have
been
an
average
porter
o
nice
complexity
and
balance
to
this
porter
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
overall
an
excellent
sipping
beer
that
only
gets
better
as
it
warms
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
roasted
malts
taste
is
roasted
malts
molasses
some
notes
of
coffee
a
touch
of
alcohol
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
i
really
appreciate
what
yards
has
done
with
this
brew
it
takes
me
back
in
time
and
makes
me
wonder
what
the
founding
fathers
must
have
drank
i
think
yards
executed
this
one
flawlessly
and
its
a
fine
interpretation
being
in
philly
i
also
cant
help
the
fact
that
i
can
find
this
one
real
fresh
this
is
a
good
beer
there
is
very
little
differentiation
between
this
porter
and
the
average
porter
from
many
other
breweries
it
was
good
to
have
this
after
a
very
long
day
but
on
its
own
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
a
bottle
o
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
wont
buy
it
again
but
its
very
cool
to
try
an
old
historic
recipe
this
is
an
excellent
porter
for
a
cold
winter
night
if
washington
did
brew
a
beer
similar
to
this
it
was
definitely
worth
fighting
for
theres
a
bright
fruit
sweetness
somewhere
in
here
if
you
look
for
it
eh
yummy
try
some
the
palate
opens
with
rather
excellent
flavors
ruined
by
excessive
carbonation
robustly
roasty
with
a
pleasing
blend
of
grainy
bitterness
and
acidity
complemented
by
flavors
of
cocoa
a
little
caramel
and
fruity
yeast
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
porter
very
dry
this
beer
has
flavors
of
unsweetened
cocoa
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
mild
bitterness
this
beer
is
light
in
body
quite
excessively
carbonated
leading
to
a
not
wholly
welcome
carbonic
acid
bite
and
lightening
the
body
to
the
point
of
wateriness
despite
it
though
theres
a
nice
fruitiness
that
also
lingers
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
too
all
told
a
pretty
decent
and
enjoyable
porter
allowing
the
carbonation
to
settle
down
greatly
enhances
the
moutfeel
and
im
adjusting
my
score
up
by
half
a
point
to
reflect
this
improvement
o
i
found
the
tavern
porter
to
be
an
interesting
take
on
a
porter
its
sweeter
than
most
normal
porters
which
is
probably
attributable
to
the
molasses
an
interesting
colonial
recipe
that
is
timeless
overall
this
is
impressive
porter
if
washington
brewed
a
similar
beer
he
truly
was
the
right
man
to
lead
this
newborn
nation
i
wonder
if
he
sold
six
packs
moreys
bottom
line
this
falls
a
bit
short
in
todays
market
but
i
wouldnt
have
been
first
in
line
back
in
the
day
if
this
is
what
our
leaders
were
drinking
then
what
happened
shame
on
the
bmcs
drinkers
of
today
this
is
so
good
i
might
even
buy
a
case
overall
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
cant
have
more
than
2
in
one
night
but
that
just
makes
my
stock
last
longer
this
was
a
wonderful
offering
perfect
every
day
drinker
of
a
porter
the
aroma
was
steep
with
roasted
malts
rich
notes
of
caramel
and
molasses
light
grain
touches
and
a
bit
of
a
herbal
note
persisted
nice
robust
flavor
rich
and
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
a
classic
coffee
and
chocolate
profile
smooth
mellow
and
quite
nice
i
think
if
theres
anything
this
beer
lacks
its
a
little
complexity
the
taste
while
awesome
gives
itself
away
almost
immediately
but
hey
if
thats
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
i
am
most
certainly
ok
with
that
delicious
thanks
ericwo
for
the
trade
d
george
washington
was
clearly
the
best
brewer
of
the
three
statesmen
or
at
least
this
beer
was
the
best
of
the
series
and
for
my
tastes
the
only
one
id
buy
again
i
love
the
concept
of
ales
of
the
revolution
series
but
they
should
be
released
seasonally
or
something
no

wants
to

i
would
drink
it
again
o
not
a
bad
offering
from
yards
glad
to
try
it
once
but
nothing
to
special
or
mind
blowing
thanks
centennial
for
sending
this
and
the
many
other
yards
beers
d
i
had
planned
to
serve
beer
from
a
certain
brewery
based
in
otsego
county
ny
to
my
friends
from
europe
when
they
arrive
i
think
ill
start
them
off
with
this
instead
for
one
thing
its
historic
pedigree
is
unmatched
and
one
more
reason
to
love
this
country
for
another
it
is
an
unusual
pleasure
to
drink
no
matter
what
continent
youre
from
a
really
solid
porter
i
tend
to
like
a
bit
more
oomph
from
the
black
patent
but
this
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
o
overall
this
is
a
good
porter
thanks
again
to
rhong187
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
would
love
to
have
again
if
i
have
the
chance
the
cost
of
this
stuff
is
atrocious
what
is
washingtons
family
getting
royalties
or
something
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
14
of
tan
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
brings
some
roast
malt
chocolate
and
subtle
alcohol
the
flavor
is
decent
but
relatively
bland
the
body
is
thin
to
medium
with
solid
carbonation
unexciting
but
unoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
drink
a
pint
of
this
again
i
liked
this
porter
a
simple
straightforward
take
on
the
style
embracing
the
roots
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
o
a
decent
beer
but
i
really
expect
more
body
out
of
a
porter
good
flavors
but
they
disappear
and
just
dont
linger
like
id
like
o
nicely
balanced
porter
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
an
easy
drinker
and
very
enjoyable
the
body
was
light
and
crisp
for
the
style
and
had
a
clean
finish
drinkability
was
good
the
beer
went
down
easily
overall
an
interesting
brew
worth
seeking
out
for
a
try
poured
into
glass
head
was
about
2
fingers
and
the
color
was
dark
and
rich
not
quite
yet
black
taste
was
smooth
and
malty
overall
mouthful
this
beer
went
down
really
smooth
and
was
no
after
taste
to
it
overall
a
good
beer
just
the
way
general
washington
intended
it
to
be

up
and
bottoms
up

pairing

bbq
sweet
bbq

would

notes

a
deep

with

taste

dry
roast
in

aftertaste
nice
roast
with

coffee
presence

flavorful
and
smooth
nicely

o
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
very
satisfying
the
smell
had
some
interesting
smoky
notes
and
the
flavor
balance
the
sweet
flavor
roasted
malt
flavor
and
slight
bitter
aftertaste
id
definitely
recommend
you
try
this
beer
especially
considering
its
historical
background
overall
i
enjoyed
it
its
a
solid
porter
and
something
i
would
drink
2
or
more
of
in
a
sitting
if
it
really
is
what
george
washington
was
drinking
then
he
was
a
beer
advocate
i
cant
believe
it
says
this
is
7
i
got
no
hint
of
that
at
all
way
to
go
kehoe
slightly
high
abv
is
the
only
thing
that
brings
down
the
drinkability
really
well
done
if
you
are
having
only
one
or
two
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
was
a
nicely
flavored
and
easy
drinking
beer
overall
it
had
some
nice
chocolate
flavors
to
it
that
i
really
enjoyed
very
nice
porter
d
smooth
and
easy
alcohol
notes
are
not
masked
as
well
as
i
would
prefer
but
this
is
nice
for
a
cool
night
to
warm
up
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
night
d
porters
are
something
i
drink
on
occasion
and
today
was
a
great
occasion
for
one
nice
chilly
day
outside
football
on
inside
went
down
nicely
slainte
thick
velvetly
mouthfeel
a
damn
good
porter
black
in
body
with
fleeting
offwhite
head
smells
of
roast
earth
wood
and
hops
tastes
of
roast
hop
bitternessdryness
cola
tang
and
some
syrup
medium
bodied
and
cola
mouthfeel
flavorful
and
sessionable
the
best
of
the
revolutionary
series
a
good
session
porter
it
reminds
me
alot
of
what
the
base
brew
for
anchor
christmas
ale
would
taste
like
before
they
add
all
the
twigs
and
stuff
d
i
really
do
like
the
flavors
and
the
interesting
historic
perspective
labelbragging
about
following
general
washingtons
original
recipe
and
being
brewed
with
molasses
good
move
good
enough
to
have
again
and
again
but
thatll
take
another
trip
eastward
if
youre
in
the
midatlantic
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
give
this
one
a
try
pours
a
fairly
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
garner
tint
off
white
head
with
some
good
lacing
nose
is
pretty
sting
with
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
molasses
the
taste
brings
forward
the
roasted
malt
and
some
chocolate
light
to
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
levels
drinks
fairly
well
especially
being
in
a
location
where
washington
himself
used
to
hold
meetings
yards
george
washington
tavern
porter
is
a
really
nice
english
porter
it
is
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
just
some
transparency
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
beer
smells
very
roasty
with
definite
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
with
some
malt
toastiness
that
is
almost
like
a
mocha
with
a
bowl
of
oatmel
the
beer
has
a
molasses
caramel
sweetness
medium
roast
flavor
and
a
subtle
bitterness
there
is
a
jammy
fruit
character
from
the
english
yeast
that
melds
well
with
the
coffee
this
is
well
balanced
without
any
dominating
flavors
allowing
this
beer
to
be
easily
enjoyed
and
many
flavors
to
come
through
drinkability
is
good
nothing
stands
out
or
is
complex
about
this
porter
but
its
still
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
good
flavor
easy
to
put
back
a
pint
or
two
this
beer
is
very
dark
and
pours
with
a
about
1
cm
of
off
white
which
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
outside
rather
quickly
not
bad
the
smell
is
of
coffee
and
caramel
it
tastes
a
bit
different
from
the
other
times
i
had
it
when
it
was
strong
coffee
and
cocoa
flavor
unfortunately
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
note
but
fortunately
it
is
mild
enough
to
not
detract
too
much
from
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
great
drinkability
for
such
a
heavy
porter
at
7
it
really
is
a
great
component
of
yards
revolution
beers
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
better
most
balanced
porters
i
have
had
looks
great
taste
great
and
can
drink
loads
of
it
yards
has
another
winner
d
not
as
porter
like
as
i
was
hoping
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
worth
noting
because
it
is
brewed
from
washingtons
recipe
beyond
that
not
much
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
beautiful
frumpy
tan
head
that
sticks
all
over
the
glass
aromas
a
brimming
over
with
molasses
and
spices
like
cinnamon
and
ginger
theres
far
more
alcohol
on
the
nose
and
far
less
roastiness
on
the
nose
than
i
normally
like
but
the
uniqueness
of
its
spicy
bouquet
has
completely
stolen
my
heart
this
porter
tastes
in
order
of
flavor
intensity
like
sweet
molasses
burnt
sugar
christmas
spices
dark
chocolate
and
general
roastiness
unlike
any
porter
ive
ever
had
intriguing
stuff
for
sure
im
going
to
give
this
beer
along
with
yards
spruce
ale
as
gifts
to
fellow
beer
geeks
this
december
having
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
the
historic
british
porters
tasted
like
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
is
any
more
than
slightly
close
to
georges
porter
that
said
its
probably
my
favorite
of
the
ales
of
the
revolution
series
drinkability
not
a
bad
porter
though
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
oomph
all
of
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
though
they
are
a
bit
subdued
i
would
say
that
if
you
are
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
porter
this
is
your
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
punch
you
in
the
face
kind
of
porter
there
are
better
choices
out
there
at
the
coppermine
pub
in
north
arlington
nj
poured
coffee
brown
with
one
finger
of
tancolored
head
and
good
lacing
smelled
of
bitter
chocolate
roasted
coffee
biscuit
and
malt
tasted
of
roasted
coffee
and
very
chocolatey
with
a
maltysweet
finish
smooth
not
overlycarbonated
mediumtothick
body
was
very
pleasant
great
session
porter
goes
down
like
liquid
candy
no
significant
carbonation
to
slow
you
down
if
you
dig
the
flavor
you
can
put
back
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
especially
when
pairing
it
up
with
a
hearty
meal
turkey
stuffing
potatoes
root
veggies
for
instance
i
will
admit
though
that
the
sweetness
does
grow
to
cloying
after
34
without
any
food
to
intercede
but
nonetheless
this
is
one
of
my
faves
taste
is
an
interesting
combination
of
licorice
dark
fruit
smoke
and
cocoa
i
could
see
this
as
being
a
historically
brewed
beer
with
some
high
fermentation
temps
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
wood
from
being
cask
conditioned
unfortunately
or
maybe
fortunately
much
to
marthas
chagrin
there
are
many
better
porters
out
there
to
choose
from
although
it
is
fun
to
step
back
and
think
of
what
the
founding
fathers
drank
and
talked
about
nearly
250
years
ago
fun
beer
i
enjoyed
it
attributed
to
a
recipe
developed
by
george
washington
this
porter
is
pretty
much
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
but
with
dark
ruby
edges
topped
off
with
a
dark
ivory
head
the
nose
is
heavy
with
molasses
and
chocolate
how
i
love
those
smells
in
the
mouth
it
is
like
drinking
rich
dark
chocolate
melted
and
lightly
hopped
yes
it
is
that
good
another
superbly
well
made
and
simple
beer
d
well
i
didnt
like
this
more
than
the
tavern
ale
but
it
wasnt
terrible
didnt
expect
it
to
be
so
bitter
but
since
it
was
my
4th
beer
tonight
it
worked
its
way
into
my
palate
if
i
seen
the
variety
case
again
and
had
nothing
else
to
buy
i
would
consider
it
again
poured
from
a
standard
12oz
brown
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
reddish
hints
and
a
lighter
brown
color
around
the
edges
tanned
head
initially
presents
itself
about
a
finger
strong
but
receeds
fairly
fast
to
just
a
thin
layer
of
lace
upon
the
top
of
the
beer
and
slight
lacing
is
evident
along
the
glassware
very
pleasant
dark
roast
aroma
with
scents
of
chocolate
and
some
suggestions
of
dark
fruit
like
plum
taste
is
the
dark
roasty
malt
with
flavors
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
a
warming
and
noticeable
flavor
of
alcohol
slight
bitterness
from
the
hops
is
there
in
the
flavor
as
well
towards
the
finish
medium
feel
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
one
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
porter
lingering
flavors
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
almost
like
plums
or
rasins
is
left
lingering
in
the
mouth
overally
quite
good
and
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
yards
well
done
dr
a
really
good
porter
but
one
will
do
it
its
too
thick
and
heavy
to
have
a
bunch
i
followed
it
with
a
smithwicks
its
undeniably
best
served
from
the
cask
at
cellar
temperature
the
molasses
involved
in
the
brewing
process
makes
it
a
great
dessert
beer
or
even
a
winter
warmer
im
content
with
just
one
but
if
you
happen
to
this
brew
in
the
cask
soak
it
up
while
you
can
d
a
competent
porter
that
was
pretty
good
with
good
attention
to
malting
and
a
nice
hops
finish
a
little
more
molasses
would
provide
more
originality
and
sharpen
the
flavor
a
bit
more
but
all
in
all
a
good
brew
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yes
i
wish
i
could
get
yards
beers
up
here
in
ma
next
time
i
am
in
the
philly
area
visiting
family
ill
need
to
pick
more
of
this
up
purchased
at
wexford
ale
house
in
wexford
pa
it
isnt
bad
at
all
but
not
as
deep
of
a
flavor
as
i
usually
to
for
the
smell
is
nice
but
rather
weak
flavor
is
not
bitter
at
all
very
mild
after
taste
but
it
is
rather
good
very
dinkable
not
heavy
so
you
cam
enjoy
a
few
at
one
sitting
this
is
tasty
stuff
nice
easy
drinking
porter
with
a
good
deal
of
flavor
very
drinkable
and
something
id
certainly
pick
up
again
im
glad
i
live
in
philadelphia
and
get
can
this
anywhere
single
from
whole
foods
fair
lakes
va
dont
drink
and
review
some
pretty
interesting
stuff
going
on
here
not
expected
in
an
english
porter
but
definitely
not
off
or
unpleasant
that
said
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
wouldve
a
more
conventional
porter
but
was
intrigued
to
have
something
off
the
beaten
path
pretty
tasty
smooth
nonetheless
i
could
see
going
through
2
or
3
of
these
until
the
novelty
wore
off
d
a
decent
porte
nothing
great
but
not
bad
at
all
i
thought
it
was
a
little
lacking
in
taste
and
pretty
mellow
but
still
pretty
decent
id
try
this
again
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
clear
deep
dark
walnut
color
with
red
highlights
close
to
being
black
very
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
ever
so
slowly
goes
to
a
thick
foam
with
pretty
good
lacing
not
much
in
aroma
to
say
very
neutral
i
enjoyed
the
taste
a
good
example
of
a
porter
i
thought
it
was
going
to
taste
more
stoutlike
but
i
was
pleasantly
surpised
big
carbonated
bubble
tickled
the
tongue
hints
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
very
drinkable
all
in
all
a
pleasant
experiance
d
again
i
love
the
concept
beer
brewed
using
the
recipe
of
the
founding
fathers
however
im
very
glad
brewing
has
come
a
long
long
way
since
then
an
average
at
best
porter
that
is
drinkable
in
a
bind
but
there
are
many
other
offerings
to
choose
over
this
one
this
is
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
pretty
average
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
pretty
much
opaque
nice
slightly
tan
head
but
somewhat
poor
lacing
the
aroma
was
not
too
pronounced
i
got
some
dark
sugar
like
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
roastyness
but
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
i
was
however
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
taste
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
was
that
it
did
not
have
as
much
roasted
malt
and
coffee
like
flavors
as
some
other
porters
i
could
taste
some
nice
burnt
sugar
sweetness
that
mingled
with
the
malt
as
well
as
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
found
it
to
be
very
pleasant
and
thought
that
while
the
body
was
a
bit
fuller
than
many
other
porters
it
was
quite
drinkable
i
definitely
found
this
beer
to
be
more
than
just
a
novelty
and
recommend
it
to
those
who
find
most
porters
a
bit
too
roasty
for
their
taste
drinkability
this
is
easily
a
session
porter
for
me
it
should
make
its
way
into
my
porter
line
up
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
porters
i
have
had
but
its
a
good
winter
drinker
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
porter
that
was
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
suffered
a
bit
from
the
fruitiness
as
it
warmed
dont
avoid
but
dont
seek
out
full
body
with
light
carbonation
very
smooth
mouthfeel
very
smooth
quite
boozy
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
little
to
no
head
and
very
small
carbonation
retained
appears
dark
brown
as
i
would
expect
smell
is
very
inviting
of
roasted
grain
or
almost
like
a
burnt
oatmeal
cocoa
sweetness
is
upfront
in
the
flavor
although
it
finishes
a
little
more
watery
than
i
would
have
enjoyed
drinkability
is
okay
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
some
decent
head
but
no
real
lacing
nice
burnt
grain
scent
with
good
hints
of
coffee
nice
taste
a
robust
porter
with
nice
coffee
flavors
but
also
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
kick
that
took
a
bit
away
from
it
goes
down
smooth
if
not
creamy
pours
a
dark
cola
color
with
a
khaki
color
head
that
is
about
one
finger
in
size
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
some
chocolate
notes
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
chocolate
malt
and
a
slight
toffee
malt
as
well
flavor
is
sweet
but
not
sugary
the
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
bodies
and
smooth
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
high
there
is
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
it
overall
its
a
nice
abv
for
a
porter
however
the
slightly
higher
content
is
well
masked
and
doesnt
detract
from
the
flavor
drinkability
a
very
tasty
porter
this
one
im
already
thinking
about
opening
another
and
even
if
i
dont
ill
be
having
another
one
fairly
soon
ive
always
wondered
if
the
general
gave
up
very
much
when
he
swore
off
drinking
any
british
brewed
porter
in
favor
of
those
brewed
in
the
american
colonies
from
drinking
this
beer
id
say
he
didnt
make
much
of
a
sacrifice
limiting
him
self
to
american
brewed
porters
i
could
easily
limit
myself
to
drinking
only
this
porter
if
i
had
reason
to
do
so
had
some
good
spice
undertones
would
definitely
have
again
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
specifically
d
very
good
porter
with
more
drinkability
then
the
more
heavily
bodies
porters
im
used
to
excellent
little
tastes
of
complexity
drinkability
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
beer
at
7
abv
it
packs
lots
of
flavor
and
great
drinkability
maybe
its
the
molasses
that
makes
it
so
smooth
notes
a
tasty
porter
from
one
of
our
founding
fathers
it
went
quite
well
with
dessertbut
i
would
not
have
more
than
one
poured
dark
with
thick
tan
head
smelled
of
roasted
hops
and
chocolate
fairly
complex
thick
bodyheavy
feel
again
can
really
taste
roasted
hops
with
suble
hints
of
the
molasses
finished
a
bit
dry
drinkability
is
the
only
downside
to
this
satisfying
porter
pours
an
opaque
color
nice
dark
coffee
raison
like
malts
with
a
bit
of
dryness
finishing
with
that
bone
dryness
which
is
nice
medium
bodied
maybe
not
as
creamy
as
a
a
bunch
of
other
porters
ive
had
but
still
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
bit
of
lacing
not
much
head
unlike
true
great
porters
great
lakes
leading
the
way
i
would
give
this
multiple
shots
and
can
be
sessionable
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
but
alas
this
is
my
only
one
very
dark
brown
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
that
laces
the
glass
aroma
and
taste
are
molasses
and
chocolate
this
beer
is
as
smooth
as
silk
and
feels
like
heaven
in
your
mouth
lightly
carbonated
and
overall
a
good
beer
i
see
no
reason
why
anybody
would
not
want
to
try
this
i
could
put
away
a
few
jars
at
the
bar
pretty
quickly
with
one
and
the
7
is
so
well
hidden
i
might
regret
it
later
but
it
is
that
easy
to
suck
down
i
would
make
this
an
everyday
type
of
beer
if
it
were
local
to
me
tasty
stuff
here
appear
dark
brown
without
much
head
medium
body
and
carbonation
fairly
sweet
and
dessert
like
finishes
with
a
dry
roast
and
fruity
chocolatey
sweetness
this
beer
is
big
on
the
chocolate
flavors
it
tastes
like
milk
chocolate
on
a
ligtly
burnt
chocolate
chip
cookie
in
a
good
way
it
reminds
me
of
another
sweet
porter
favorite
of
mine
middle
ages
duke
of
winship
a
must
try
if
you
like
this
beer
drinkabilityoverall
impression
i
was
hoping
for
more
complexity
in
this
beer
especially
for
a
porter
i
found
the
taste
to
be
somewhat
onedimensional
with
the
raisinfigprune
flavor
to
be
the
only
real
discernible
flavor
outside
of
the
malt
which
had
a
difficult
time
asserting
itself
i
have
a
hard
time
panning
this
beer
though
considering
it
is
a
historically
accurate
recipe
and
brewing
knowledge
and
techniques
have
improved
dramatically
over
the
past
230
years
the
history
behind
the
beer
and
the
fact
that
yards
didnt
deviate
from
washingtons
original
recipe
is
to
be
commended
the
simplicity
of
the
beer
makes
it
very
drinkable
though
i
would
probably
reach
for
another
brew
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
hearty
bellywarming
porter
as
this
one
didnt
quite
have
the
body
i
was
anticipating
dsurely
drinkable
but
the
amount
of
carbonation
turned
me
off
a
bit
surely
slighty
better
than
average
tasty
once
you
can
get
passed
the
gas
on
tap
at
mcgillins
pours
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
or
lowlights
whatever
way
you
look
at
it
thin
tan
head
that
falls
into
a
coating
over
the
top
some
lacing
smells
like
dark
chocolate
mollasses
and
toffee
tastes
mostly
of
chocolate
malts
some
honey
and
toffee
mouthfeel
is
velvety
and
has
somewhat
of
a
smokey
bite
this
is
a
smooth
porter
that
could
go
for
a
few
pints
pours
a
perfectly
clear
ruby
hued
brown
smooth
malty
nose
flavor
is
nice
and
smooth
with
a
thick
malt
presence
nothing
showy
or
crazy
here
its
just
a
nice
smooth
profile
good
liquid
feel
easily
drinkable
i
like
this
porter
nothing
crazy
but
a
pleasure
to
drink
being
7you
cant
really
taste
it
but
if
you
have
too
many
you
will
feel
it
i
have
had
better
porters
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
one
down
d
sorry
george
this
ones
a
dump
overall
a
good
drink
a
bit
sweet
and
a
little
more
bitterness
from
the
hops
would
help
to
balance
this
beer
out
the
7
is
hidden
very
well
and
as
i
have
seen
from
other
yards
beers
this
is
an
easy
drinker
that
i
could
sit
down
with
friends
and
polish
off
a
few
scott
pours
a
dark
brown
near
black
color
with
just
a
touch
of
head
on
top
that
dissolves
very
fast
nose
is
an
excellent
surprise
lots
of
strong
roasted
malt
some
chocolate
and
coffee
a
little
spice
as
well
taste
is
likewise
solid
lots
of
roasted
malt
up
front
a
little
biting
on
the
tongue
a
touch
of
chocolate
as
well
feel
is
good
and
nearly
cream
although
maybe
a
touch
thin
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
from
yards
tasty
and
filling
flavor
is
of
roasted
malts
molasses
and
light
hops
made
an
excellent
finish
to
the
meal
paired
with
a
delicious
apple
cobbler
d
an
easy
drinking
dark
ale
an
average
porter
but
has
its
redeeming
qualities
also
i
would
try
this
again
it
is
a
drinkable
porter
tasty
and
creamy
a
bit
too
rich
to
be
sessionable
fine
considering
abv
which
is
fairly
well
hidden
but
a
very
nice
sipping
brew
it
went
well
on
its
own
with
the
turkey
pot
pie
and
the
chocolate
dessert
i
ate
at
city
tavern
yards
general
washington
porter
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
creamy
head
the
head
stayed
for
the
duration
of
this
rich
porter
the
smell
was
indicative
of
what
awaited
me
in
this
glass
of
american
history
a
rich
malty
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
molasses
and
only
enough
hops
to
balance
the
taste
was
great
the
front
is
malty
and
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
molasses
but
not
at
all
overpowering
the
finish
is
smooth
with
the
roasted
malts
coming
through
nicely
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
is
smooth
and
enjoyable
and
it
does
nit
sit
heavy
or
leave
a
poor
aftertaste
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
but
at
7
abv
caution
must
be
taken
to
not
overindulge
cheers
this
poured
with
a
thick
deeptan
head
with
decent
retention
the
nose
was
roasty
malty
and
a
bit
chocolaty
the
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights
the
mouthfeel
was
very
full
and
i
experienced
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
charcoal
flavors
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
more
chocolaty
than
anything
else
i
found
this
to
be
a
highly
pleasant
beer
and
would
recommend
it
as
a
finish
to
a
romantic
evening
especially
around
valentines
day
value
beer
a
simple
porter
black
roasty
headless
bit
of
carbonation
medium
or
less
mouthfeel
molasses
as
it
warms
i
could
still
drink
a
bunch
of
this
a
touch
of
chocolate
malt
cocacola
aftertaste
more
sweet
than
bitter
which
arrives
in
the
finish
d
pretty
good
it
is
a
bit
strong
for
a
porter
but
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
drinkabilitywith
it
not
being
to
rich
or
sweet
this
ones
east
to
drink
and
enjoyable
on
a
cool
day
cheers
to
smoky
for
me
but
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
less
than
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
low
this
beer
has
no
off
smells
and
aside
from
a
astringent
taste
that
is
not
really
anoying
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
pours
a
rich
murky
brownblack
color
with
a
14
tan
head
aroma
is
roasted
coffee
caramel
malts
and
molasses
flavor
starts
off
with
a
nice
blend
of
coffee
and
molasses
with
notes
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
evident
midsip
before
it
all
rinses
away
for
the
cleanest
finish
ive
ever
seenin
a
porter
with
a
little
alcohol
warmth
present
afterwards
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
thick
but
its
finish
adds
to
its
drinkability
this
beer
is
probably
better
kept
for
the
winter
though
which
is
when
ill
seek
it
again
yards
has
a
winner
here
worth
getting
a
six
at
least
and
a
case
if
you
like
the
style
we
spoke
with
chefproprietor
walter
staib
who
told
us
it
took
quite
a
few
trials
and
errors
to
reduce
the
abv
down
to
its
present
7
and
get
the
taste
right
that
they
certainly
did
very
good
porter
had
better
had
worse
and
a
week
from
now
i
might
forget
i
had
this
theres
something
here
dont
get
me
wrong
but
its
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
really
assign
flavor
to
it
and
the
aroma
is
equally
soso
just
a
bit
more
than
average
that
said
the
abv
is
big
enough
that
what
its
not
delivering
in
flavor
works
against
looking
this
way
again
sure
it
goes
down
easily
enough
but
it
never
gives
much
to
remember
it
by
and
i
tend
to
want
to
recall
the
high
points
of
what
ive
had
to
drink
not
enough
high
points
here
though
poured
a
very
deep
brown
color
with
reddish
highlights
moderate
creamy
offwhite
head
that
left
slight
lacing
as
the
glass
emptied
smell
is
toasty
with
very
strong
notes
of
dark
bitter
chocolate
taste
is
reminicent
of
strong
black
slightly
bitter
coffee
some
nice
ripe
dark
fruit
taste
is
also
present
the
alcohol
is
slightly
present
but
really
compliments
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
finish
slows
a
moderate
bitterness
mixed
with
coffee
and
chocolate
and
leaves
a
truly
excellent
taste
in
the
mouth
nice
and
creamy
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
excellent
d
good
could
have
a
couple
but
not
too
many
due
to
sweetness
drinkabilty
ok
one
is
enough
drinkability
and
overall
delicious
try
it
cheers
aroma
is
very
muted
but
some
mild
sweetness
of
indeterminable
origin
comes
through
dark
brown
with
a
large
creamy
head
more
sweet
than
roasty
but
it
has
sort
of
sulpher
tinge
to
it
rather
than
any
molasses
i
have
had
some
mild
cherry
fruit
flavors
in
the
finish
doesnt
have
that
roasty
wholesomeness
i
expect
froma
porter
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wish
i
liked
better
and
perhaps
it
merits
another
taste
to
see
whether
the
unusual
finish
was
a
function
of
an
off
bottle
drinkability
is
good
a
different
kind
of
porter
then
i
usually
go
for
but
the
flavors
are
good
even
though
they
are
more
subdude
and
not
as
big
and
in
your
face
as
others
overall
this
is
an
excellent
porter
and
one
that
hides
its
alcohol
content
very
well
poured
a
deep
crimson
with
deep
brownish
tint
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
didnt
stick
around
longblack
strap
molasses
is
big
in
the
aroma
along
with
bursting
fruitinessvery
effervescent
molasses
and
bitter
chocolate
notes
hit
up
front
maybe
a
touch
of
orange
finishing
with
light
earthiness
to
keep
things
in
check
my
only
complaint
and
its
a
small
one
is
that
it
seems
a
bit
thin
but
the
alc
is
hidden
well
and
is
quite
drinkable
i
bought
it
on
presidents
day
for
the
fact
it
was
gw
but
it
is
a
real
fine
beer
what
ever
day
you
buy
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
frothy
carbonation
just
saves
this
beer
from
being
too
watery
in
the
mouth
it
is
light
make
no
mistake
at
7
its
not
quite
the
session
beer
but
it
really
is
an
easy
drinker
closing
my
eyes
i
can
imagine
our
forefathers
gathered
together
at
city
tavern
discussing
the
important
issues
of
our
country
while
enjoying
the
nectar
of
the
future
presidents
creation
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
but
there
is
an
odd
roughness
to
it
around
the
tongue
the
taste
is
complex
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
solid
but
different
from
most
porters
this
looks
good
a
nice
dark
brown
colorand
the
carbonation
is
crazy
i
know
this
is
bottle
conditioned
and
the
head
is
like
four
fingers
the
smell
is
alittle
slightbut
with
fruit
and
some
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
oksome
roasting
flavorit
almost
tastes
like
coffee
with
prunes
or
raisins
this
doesnt
taste
badbut
it
is
very
different
for
a
porter
im
a
little
intrigued
every
time
i
take
a
sip
i
taste
a
different
flavor
sometimes
medicinalsome
chocolatefruit
and
some
coffee
the
label
says
this
is
an
old
recipe
im
going
to
give
this
another
trymaybe
ill
grow
to
like
it
more
and
more
this
could
be
the
last
yards
beer
i
ever
try
almost
every
one
ive
had
has
the
same
damn
off
characteristics
someone
at
yards
needs
to
completely
dismantle
the
brewery
and
sterilize
everything
theyve
got
bugs
in
the
works
if
for
some
reason
these
are
the
flavors
and
smells
they
are
seeking
they
need
a
new
recipe
writer
or
a
new
yeast
or
something
their
stuff
is
just
weird
edit
the
bottle
says
there
is
molasses
in
it
this
may
be
another
factor
in
the
unique
flavors
i
get
nicely
blended
and
not
dominated
by
molasses
at
all
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
as
i
do
enjoy
it
in
the
bottle
this
offering
from
yards
one
of
their
ales
of
the
revolution
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
on
top
and
very
little
carbonation
apparent
the
aromas
are
of
roasted
malt
along
with
hints
of
vanilla
dark
chocolate
and
bitterless
coffee
taste
was
a
mix
of
charcoal
and
smooth
coffee
not
bitter
but
smooth
very
smooth
ending
with
some
dryness
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
a
bit
more
watery
than
i
wouldve
liked
a
pretty
good
beer
flavor
is
way
too
roastmalt
acidic
yes
there
are
other
beerlike
characteristics
and
some
coffee
and
chocolatelike
qualities
but
the
acid
dominates
to
the
point
of
being
a
real
detriment
something
could
have
gone
wrong
with
the
bottle
conditioning
but
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
felt
a
bit
too
experimental
and
homebrew
like
to
fully
enjoy
a
different
take
on
the
style
to
be
sure
drinkability
this
is
quite
a
good
brew
with
a
big
roasty
character
i
would
say
that
this
beer
got
a
bit
better
after
aging
a
year
its
still
just
as
good
with
bbq
though
this
beer
is
one
of
the
many
porters
that
borders
on
a
stout
wisely
they
still
call
it
a
porter
and
it
represents
the
style
quite
well
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
huge
almost
overflowing
cream
head
and
excellent
retention

light

again
poured
a
nice
dark
color
with
a
longlasting
mocha
head
surprisingly
little
aroma
what
there
was
seemed
to
hint
at
sweet
chocolate
flavor
profile
was
puzzling
almost
no
roasted
malt
flavors
other
than
the
barest
coffee
at
the
very
end
the
predominant
flavor
was
an
oddly
winelike
flavor
both
sweet
and
tart
the
combination
did
not
harmonize
well
bottle
notes
that
the
beer
is
brewed
with
molasses
perhaps
im
simply
too
acclimated
to
beers
brewed
in
the
traditional
english
style
and
the
american
interpretations
to
be
able
to
appreciate
this
reincarnation
of
the
colonial
philadelphia
style
overalli
havent
had
many
porters
but
i
must
say
this
is
the
best
one
ive
had
full
of
flavor
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
balance
and
while
it
isnt
exactly
complex
its
certaintly
one
to
pick
up
last
swigs
strong
porter
rye

this
bottle
saved
my
visit
to
rembranbdts
on
a
pubcrawl
this
was
the
best
beer
they
had
overall
a
good
porter
very
robust
and
quite
enjoyable
its
kind
of
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
george
washingtons
real
recipe
a
darn
good
beer
much
thanks
to
kafkaesb

took
forever
to
pour

very
thick
pillowy
head
that
is
lightly
coffee
colored
rich

color
to
the
beer
nice

as
i
drink
it
the
aroma
is
fully
of
roasted

and
nuttiness
a
little
coffee
in
the
background
too
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
loads
of
molasses
roasted
nuts
toffee
and
some
espresso
too
just
enough
hop
presence
for
a
nice
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
the
carbonation
just
seems
to
stick
to
the
toungue
overall
comments
a
decent
beer
reminiscent
of
homebrew
experimentations
gone
right
and
wrong
the
final
sip
was
far
better
than
the
first
with
this
brew
theres
something
a
little
funky
about
every
aspect
of
this
one
yet
it
is
imminently
endearing
id
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
and
id
probably
even
get
it
again
in
the
bottle
despite
all
of
my
complaints
its
certainly
different
and
in
a
good
way

only
complaint
and
it
doesnt
affect
the
overall
review
of
the
beer
is
the
price
9
and
change
for
a
six
pack
is
a
bit
stiffmight
be
my
locale
but
ive
seen
it
this
price
in
3
statesoverall
it
doesnt
warrant
that
price
a
damn
good
porter
but
theres
better
ones
out
there
for
cheaper

almost
black

not

lasted

also
managed

good
ring
of

multiple
times

toasted

fresh

flavor
sees
the
same
profile
as
the
nose
but
theres
a
sweet
twang
that
i
would
attribute
to
the
molasses
not
as
big
as
id
expected
but
still
flavorful
ends
with
a
dry
and
bitter
chocolatered
wine
flavor
a
little
on
the
thin
side

still
drinkable

mildly
dark

color

in
the
aroma
with
an
underlying
sugary
sweetness
and
a
dry

everything
is
fairly
subtle
and

wcept
for
the
lingering
sugar
sweetness
that
stands
out
amongst
everything

kinda
weaker
and
bit
thin
than
most
porters
chocolatly
witha
subtle
sweetness

still
very
good
and
definetly
not
to
be
passed
up

dont

ill
be
drinking
the
second
one
i
had
deep
dark
brown
appearance
thin
light
tan
head
with
little
retention
lace
is
negligible
the
aroma
is
funky
and
barnyard
yes
like
a
lambic
to
an
extent
seemingly
theres
some
cherry
as
well
and
some
chocolate
malt
as
well
the
taste
is
funky
as
well
i
think
something
has
gone
awry
here
but
not
in
a
real
bad
way
it
tastes
o
k
maybe
a
little
off
putting
but
not
dumpable
and
in
no
way
does
it
taste
like
a
porter
its
sweet
and
cherry
like
a
little
husky
astringency
dry
finish
a
titch
sour
but
not
disturbingly
a
little
acidic
not
something
id
reach
for
again
if
this
is
what
it
really
is
supposed
to
taste
like
1
79
12
oz
im
wondering
if
the
unique
yards
taste
is
in
the
yeast
as
noted
it
works
best
in
this
ale
the
best
ive
had
so
far
also
as
noted
i
love
the
historical
references
and
attributes
george
washington
on
the
label
and
cap
bravo
to
yards
tried
this
one
as
it
was
recently
stocked
at
my
local
beer
store
and
i
really
like
their
love
stout
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
porter
style
what
got
my
immediate
attention
was
the
fact
that
this
porter
did
not
have
any
telltale
bitterness
very
soft
in
the
finish
another
positive
attribute
is
that
the
7
abv
was
not
overwhelming
by
any
means
just
a
creeping
warming
feeling
i
dont
know
about
the
claim
that
this
beer
is
based
on
general
georges
recipe
but
i
really
like
this
one
and
will
buy
a
bunch
more
the
next
time
im
in
philly
i
will
be
sure
to
stop
at
city
tavern
to
seek
this
one
out
on
draft
the
taste
is
warming
with
a
fruitinesscherry
and
a
bit
of
yeastiness
some
coffee
notes
as
well
in
a
quite
drinkable
brew
no
loud
hops
which
was
fine
for
this
malty
dark
fruity
ale
i
think
the
yeast
brought
out
a
bit
much
ester
but
overall
it
went
down
easy
and
would
like
to
try
it
on
draft
the
hidden
alcohol
and
lack
of
bitterness
combine
with
the
fruity
flavors
to
lend
this
a
pleasant
drinkability
very
offbeat
for
a
porter
but
this
is
said
to
be
modeled
after
18th
century
recipes
the
founding
fathers
imbibed
well
if
this
brew
is
a
true
indication
of
their
favorites
i
expected
a
much
larger
beer
from
the
outgoing
smell
and
alcohol
content
but
this
one
is
smooth
and
balanced
taste
is
small
and
sweet
in
the
mouth
notes
of
coffee
caramel
and
toasty
graham
clean
and
controlled
finish
smoothness
with
a
late
touch
of
mineral
hops
goes
down
fast
and
smooth
another
pleasing
beer
furnished
by
kmpitz2
very
nice
label
pours
a
dark
brown
color
a
little
light
for
a
porter
with
a
small
head
that
sticks
around
the
aroma
is
full
of
a
dark
fruityness
as
well
as
some
coffeechocolate
interesting
flavor
not
what
i
expected
lots
of
caramel
flavor
and
a
good
malty
character
this
seems
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
but
its
still
a
great
beer
although
a
bit
odd
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
finger
of
head
that
sticks
around
to
cover
the
beer
the
nose
is
interesting
theres
some
fruity
grape
in
the
nose
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
intriguing
the
flavor
is
also
interesting
there
is
a
sweetness
and
a
roasted
bitter
that
lingers
after
swallowing
the
beer
the
label
says
there
is
molasses
in
there
that
may
be
some
of
the
oddness
i
find
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
there
is
something
i
dont
like
about
the
feel
drinkability
suffers
from
the
odd
flavors
i
guess
its
the
original
flavors
in
washingtons
beer
but
its
not
on
my
list
of
things
i
want
in
my
beer
looks
more
like
a
dark
ale
than
a
porter
thinlooking
body
light
showing
through
the
liquid
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
beige
head
doesnt
really
rise
but
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
toasted
malt
and
cocoa
plus
some
hops
shining
through
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
leading
to
a
quick
initial
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
flavor
but
morphing
almost
immediately
into
bitter
coffee
and
a
cherry
tang
cherry
flavor
lingers
as
does
a
tannic
talc
feel
with
each
successive
sip
the
cherry
builds
and
adds
a
bit
of
raisin
the
tangy
flavor
unfortunately
overwhelms
the
malt
profile

this
is
a
rich
tasting
flavorful
beer
not
sure
how
true
to
the
style
it
is
but
i
will
drink
and
buy
again
this
is
a
beer
to
savor
whilst
reading
or
surfing
the
web
12
ounce
bottle
a
very
nice
drinking
porter
this
pours
out
a
reddishbrown
color
that
lets
some
light
through
and
has
about
an
inch
of
light
tan
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
cap
of
bubbles
leaves
a
good
bit
of
lacing
rings
around
the
glass
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
smells
more
of
a
brown
ale
then
your
typical
porter
with
slightly
sweet
malts
coming
though
with
light
scents
of
coffee
and
chocolate
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
are
the
main
factors
in
the
taste
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
as
well
overall
a
very
mild
taste
and
smell
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
well
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
not
hindered
by
any
taste
of
alcohol
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
seems
more
of
a
hybrid
of
a
porter
and
brown
ale
that
is
a
little
too
light
on
the
flavor
for
me
pours
a
translucent
deep
copperbrown
color
with
a
sustaining
light
tan
colored
head
dark
berries
and
roasted
malt
mostly
in
the
aroma
with
some
decent
hop
characteristics
too
treaclelike
weetness
and
thin
mouthfeel
yet
complex
on
the
palate
earthy
and
grassy
in
the
hops
and
peaty
barklike
and
mossy
in
the
malt
dark
berrylike
and
slightly
tart
in
the
finish
good
18th
century
style
interpretation
moderately
drinkable
tasting
note
if
you
mix
yards
george
washington
and
its
thomas
jefferson
you
get
george
jefferson
which
is
what
yards
entered
in
the
skullsplitter
barleywine
fest
i
was
at
a
few
months
ago
i
like
this
mix
more
than
george
washington
alone
although
not
as
much
as
tj
alone
the
hops
and
malts
are
better
balanced
in
the
mix
than
in
the
gw
and
theres
more
complexity
ng
extremely
dark
reddishbrown
body
with
a
light
tan
head
thats
light
and
airy
the
head
fades
to
a
thinner
wetter
coating
the
aroma
is
slightly
sharp
with
molasses
and
brown
sugar
its
got
the
same
dark
sugary
flavor
with
a
mild
fruitiness
slightly
chocolatey
and
nutty
really
interesting
beer
that
is
bigger
than
what
i
had
expected
from
a
porter
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
1
of
tan
head
which
made
for
excellent
foamy
lace
over
the
slightly
reddish
dark
brown
brew
aroma
is
slight
and
somewhat
generic
not
the
dark
malt
aroma
one
would
expect
taste
is
dark
malts
balanced
well
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
hops
not
overdone
with
the
darks
like
some
porters
do
and
not
overly
sweet
either
nice
mouthfeel
is
great
and
drinkability
is
as
well
head
is
light
tan
big
at
first
then
slowly
dies
down
into
a
creamy
film
that
stays
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
dark
brown
colour
filled
with
ruby
highlights
fruity
smell
splashed
with
malt
unexpected
fruitiness
up
front
this
caught
my
off
guard
and
made
me
fear
i
did
not
like
this
beer
thankfully
im
quickly
given
a
healthy
blast
of
malt
the
chocolate
in
background
teases
my
confused
taste
buds
for
some
reason
this
beer
is
not
very
pleasing
on
the
palate
its
hard
to
say
why
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
again
backwash
i
wasnt
nearly
as
impressed
with
this
as
with
the
jefferson
ale
while
not
a
bad
beer
it
lacked
the
punch
and
complexity
that
the
jefferson
ale
did
maybe
i
expected
too
much
from
this
after
having
the
ale
but
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
cant
really
find
anything
to
fault
nor
can
i
single
out
any
particularly
salient
aspects
except
perhaps
the
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
however
ill
definitely
give
this
another
try
and
will
look
forward
to
enjoying
the
rest
of
the
series
light
smell
of
chocolate
malt
but
not
that
much
detectable
nose
dark
opeque
ruby
color
in
the
glass
brew
settles
to
a
tan
sheen
not
quite
a
head
on
the
surface
of
the
brew
robust
malty
sweet
regal
roasty
malt
taste
with
nice
overtones
of
cocoa
and
roasted
hazelnut
a
brew
that
tastes
better
than
it
looks
and
smells
pours
an
odd
brownish
red
maybe
i
expected
darker
barely
any
head
though
some
bubbles
cascading
to
the
top
show
it
does
have
some
decent
carbonation
soft
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
and
used
coffee
grounds
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thin
and
the
flavor
is
severely
lacking
tastes
like
well
nothing
just
begins
to
hint
at
some
nutty
chocolate
undertones
but
doesnt
build
into
anything
at
all
maybe
this
is
how
beer
tasted
when
washington
lived
if
so
weve
come
a
long
way
maybe
thats
what
yards
is
shooting
for
i
dont
know
kinda
reminds
of
the
flavorless
bread
i
ate
one
time
that
i
was
told
was
a
clone
of
what
soldiers
during
the
civil
war
ate
i
think
it
was
called
hard
tack
or
something
ughh
7
abv
can
be
felt
somewhat
afterwards
as
it
is
slightly
warming
but
not
really
detectable
in
the
flavor
this
is
pretty
disappointing
yards
brews
some
good
stuff
but
this
isnt
included
thanks
to
beerluvr
for
another
quality
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
lacey
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
warm
roasted
dark
malt
scent
that
reveals
its
elevated
abv
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
rich
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
but
finishes
warm
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
porter
i
like
the
concept
but
im
not
sure
i
can
drink
too
many
more
of
these
pours
a
dark
coffeecaramel
with
a
small
tan
head
not
quite
opaque
but
about
as
dark
as
it
could
be
while
still
allowing
some
light
the
aroma
is
sweet
roasted
and
ever
so
lightly
tinged
with
alcohol
a
heavy
mouthfeel
that
is
full
yet
not
filling
carries
a
taste
that
is
simply
wonderful
nutty
with
anise
highlights
and
hints
of
roasted
coffee
all
blended
into
a
slightly
sweet
and
satisfying
flavor
there
is
just
a
suggestion
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
cutting
down
slightly
on
the
drinkability
score
but
a
very
nice
brew
nonetheless
it
is
a
dark
brwon
to
black
in
color
the
aroma
has
some
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
it
is
really
smooth
and
sweet
not
overly
sweet
but
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
making
it
an
excellent
close
to
any
meal
there
is
chocolate
fruit
and
caramel
notes
in
finishes
with
a
long
molasses
taste
it
lingers
for
some
time
and
coats
the
mouth
well
there
are
so
many
flavors
going
on
that
i
did
not
notice
the
alcohol
it
is
comforting
i
really
enjoyed
this
unique
and
rich
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
very
flavorful
as
the
roastiness
lasts
well
after
swallowing
this
is
a
little
heavier
bodied
than
other
porters
but
is
extremely
drinkable
great
brew
taste
fine
porter
flavor
a
bit
thin
though
little
bit
of
plums
going
on
in
there
can
taste
the
slight
hint
of
molassas
very
pleasant
taste
although
not
as
robust
as
id
like
appearance
deep
ruby
amber
brown
with
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
leaves
behind
thick
even
patches
of
lacing
nice
aroma
some
sharp
fruit
sweetness
wrapped
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
that
breed
some
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
tones
with
a
kiss
of
alcohol
noticeable
taste
creamy
edge
with
chocolate
roasts
and
alcohol
infused
plums
or
something
of
that
nature
very
robust
porter
nice
offering
from
our
friends
at
yards
mouthfeel
a
medium
bodied
ale
but
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
decent
carbonation
drinkability
decent
overall
nice
robust
flavor
solid
in
the
aromatics
i
just
want
a
little
more
body
to
chew
on
the
taste
is
a
wave
of
flavors
all
dark
first
some
roasted
then
dark
wood
like
burnt
pine
cones
if
that
makes
any
sense
there
is
some
caramel
flavor
too
but
without
the
sweetness
its
more
pronounced
more
full
like
a
charlestown
chew
the
sweetness
never
gets
to
overpower
the
beer
because
the
roasted
grains
come
in
again
and
again
the
finish
is
medium
and
dry
thats
the
only
thing
stopping
me
from
having
alot
more
excellent
thanks
to
francisweizen
for
throwing
this
in
first
off
i
like
porters
this
is
a
good
one
it
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
medium
tan
head
there
is
a
lot
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
coffee
and
smoky
malt
the
taste
is
similar
but
more
on
the
coffee
malty
side
it
has
a
bitter
hint
that
i
like
sometimes
porters
can
lean
toward
the
sweet
the
sweetness
that
is
there
has
a
hint
of
dates
or
currants
the
beer
is
a
real
mouthful
it
is
thick
and
creamy
and
goes
down
smooth
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
definitely
worth
more
than
one
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
small
tan
head
a
distinict
vanilla
aroma
dominates
the
smell
the
taste
has
none
of
the
afore
mentioned
vanilla
charactistic
it
starts
out
hinting
at
a
roasted
malt
but
quickly
goes
away
from
that
to
an
almost
sour
finish
i
know
that
vanilla
flavors
in
beer
are
not
high
on
alot
of
peoples
list
but
i
think
if
it
had
a
little
of
that
in
the
flavor
to
match
the
aroma
it
might
have
increased
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
i
like
the
idea
behind
this
historic
brew
based
on
an
authentic
recipe
even
if
the
style
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
color
is
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
mediumsmall
tan
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
almost
fruitcake
like
with
a
hint
of
olive
the
fruity
character
shows
up
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
which
finishes
on
a
noticeably
sour
note
this
one
would
be
nice
for
sipping
in
the
evening
after
dinner
especially
on
a
cold
winter
night
pours
a
very
dense
head
that
is
creamy
and
thick
whipped
up
like
a
meringue
unique
and
going
nowhere
the
beer
is
dark
brown
and
transparent
with
red
edges
thick
lace
and
stain
all
over
smells
of
dark
roast
some
sodalike
quality
think
dr
pepper
and
some
quite
nutty
scents
taste
is
sourish
at
first
almostcherry
like
with
dark
toasted
flavors
slowly
creeping
over
slight
molasses
notes
too
with
a
dregs
of
coffee
flavored
drying
finish
fullish
mouthfeel
looks
better
than
it
tastes
a
solid
porter
with
plenty
of
character
just
a
little
cherryish
for
my
tastes
was
hoping
this
one
would
outdo
the
jefferson
ale
and
it
certainly
did
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
to
near
black
colour
with
a
medium
sized
offwhite
head
which
is
rather
creamy
looking
smelled
sweet
with
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
hints
throughout
earth
tones
also
were
apparent
so
far
this
looks
and
smells
more
like
a
tame
stout
to
me
than
a
porter
nonetheless
no
complaints
thusfar
either
different
good
in
this
case
the
taste
here
is
rather
solid
with
an
ever
so
slightly
smoked
coffee
and
malt
flavour
dominating
a
steady
bitterness
throughout
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
provides
for
a
silky
and
smooth
brew
that
is
quite
drinkable
much
more
enjoyable
than
the
good

not
great
jefferson
tavern
ale
different
but
tasty
overall
a
damn
good
porter
ill
buy
this

highly

i
received
this
gem
as
part
of
the
christmas
exchange
put
on
my
xlperro
this
year
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
draw
jcalbi
and
this
is
just
one
of
many
terrific
bottles
that
he
sent
my
way
a
big
ba
thanks
for
this
porter
definitely
not
your
typical
porter
which
in
this
case
is
a
good
thing
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
the
roasty
malt
porter
but
its
nice
to
try
something
different
bravo
to
yards
for
bringing
out
the
beers
our
ancestors
would
be
drinking
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
and
i
certainly
look
forward
to
trying
the
others
as
well
this
was
a
different
and
tasty
porter
from
the
folks
at
yards
the
appearance
was
black
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
of
foam
the
aromas
were
of
dark
fruits
hops
dark
roasted
malts
alcohol
and
more
the
taste
was
very
fruity
with
hops
and
roasted
malts
in
the
forefront
as
well
the
fruitiness
was
a
bit
overwhelming
and
in
my
opinion
it
shadowed
the
potential
chocolatey
goodness
and
deep
roasted
flavors
that
this
porter
could
have
had
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
to
thick
and
the
drinkability
was
decent
this
was
almost
like
a
dark
version
ot
the
regular
tavern
ale
i
dont
see
how
this
beer
costs
the
liquor
store
i
work
at
about
12
a
six
pack
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
pours
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
settling
over
very
dark
red
liquid
nose
is
lightly
malty
with
some
anise
notes
in
it
the
taste
is
sweet
at
first
with
some
brown
sugar
tasted
then
roasty
malt
kicks
in
very
slight
alcohol
note
pops
up
as
well
finishes
with
a
rich
mouthcoating
maltiness
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
yet
nicely
done
and
quite
enjoyable

good
brew
a
slightly
hazy
very
deep
chestnut
body
appears
almost
black
on
the
bar
but
reveals
russett
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
and
it
maintains
its
creamy
light
tan
head
throughout
almost
the
entire
glass
beautiful
creamy
rings
and
short
sheets
of
lacing
eventually
deteriorate
to
wide
splashes
but
also
add
greatly
to
its
appearance
the
nose
displays
dark
cocolate
and
yeasty
fruitiness
over
a
touch
of
lightly
roasted
malt
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
hops
in
the
background
some
alcohol
is
evident
but
never
detracts
from
its
appeal
the
body
is
medium
and
its
very
fine
and
natural
bottle
conditioned
carbonation
leaves
it
exceptionally
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
sets
forth
a
balanced
combination
of
light
yeasty
fruitiness
chocolate
caramel
and
a
cusp
of
delicate
roastiness
it
finishes
drying
with
a
quick
note
of
alcohol
followed
by
some
roasty
dryness
and
a
clear
caramel
and
molasses
flavor
its
not
really
complex
but
theres
enough
going
on
that
you
might
miss
some
of
it
the
first
few
times
around
and
it
is
rich
and
inviting
calling
you
back
for
another
sip
a
decent
beer
that
deserves
a
try
although
i
think
its
alcohol
might
be
a
bit
limiting
in
overall
drinkability
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
it
poured
a
nice
dark
brownblack
colour
i
found
the
taste
to
be
somewhat
sour
and
unpleasant
and
at
first
smell
i
was
reminded
of
paint
very
strange
overall
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
porter
enjoy
o
im
not
quite
sold
on
the
balance
of
this
beer
it
has
an
interesting
flavour
but
i
dont
think
theres
enough
maltiness
to
stand
up
to
the
unusual
sour
and
smoky
flavours
for
a
porter
using
smoked
malt
requires
a
delicate
hand
too
little
and
it
goes
unnoticed
too
much
and
it
can
overwhelm
both
the
beer
and
the
drinker
but
this
recipe
implements
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
supports
the
flavours
of
the
other
malts
rather
than
hides
them

i
warmed

overall
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
its
got
a
deep
smokey
complex
flavor
that
really
opens
up
as
it
warms
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
a
friend
o
never
had
a
british
porter
like
this
for
smoke
beer
enthusiasts
o
decent
porter
good
flavor
smooth
drinking
im
not
much
into
smoked
beers
but
this
one
is
very
wellbalanced
the
smoke
provides
a
nice
complement
to
the
toffee
and
treacle
flavor
of
the
malt
without
going
too
far
and
leaving
behind
a
briny

a
really
nice

i
may
visit
again

d
solid
beer
all
around
no
complaints
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
robustness
of
flavoring
while
the
nose
did
a
nice
job
of
beginning
to
describe
the
beer
it
didnt
quite
prepare
you
for
the
powerful
pervasive
onslaught
of
smokiness
through
the
taste
it
was
like
black
coffee
meets
mesquite
bbq
meets
a
beautifully
peaty
scotch
these
blended
wonderfully
across
a
base
of
sweeter
chocolate
brown
and
coffee
malts
with
even
a
bit
of
hops
stopping
by
to
say
hello
and
add
some
grassiness
the
flavor
is
strong
and
excellent
to
style
and
this
guy
will
happily
take
you
to
foggy
london
town
and
back
with
a
smile
on
your
face
the
entire
time
love
this
beer
but
a
terrible
misnomer
call
it
what
it
is
a
fantastic
smoked
porter

pours
dark
but
with
a
lack

a
sweetness

that
resembles

mouthfeel

will

overall
it
was
nice
to
come
back
to
this
one
seeing
as
its
been
a
couple
of
years
since
i
had
it
it
was
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
overall
i
like
this
porter
its
balanced
with
its
above
average
abv
and
packs
quite
a
punch
with
flavor
on
the
whole
a
smooth
solid
imperial
porter
good
stuff
and
easy
drinking
from
a
local
southern
michigan
brewery
o
overall
a
good
porter
its
not
groundbreaking
but
it
does
taste
like
a
slight
throwback
to
the
original
porter
stronger
in
alcohol
and
flavor
than
some
porters
although
not
quite
as
much
so
as
some
of
the
accounts
of
historic
porters
poured
from
a
bottlle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
quarter
finger
worth
of
offwhite
head
pretty
much
looks
like
any
other
porter
basically
smells
of
vanilla
and
coffee
beans
although
i
do
have
a
slight
siun
infection
so
perhaps
theres
a
little
bit
more
although
from
previous
porters
i
have
had
i
would
doubt
it
tastes
like
vanilla
dark
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
predominantly
the
coffee
though
the
mouthfeel
unlocks
nothing
new
except
for
a
slight
burnt
malt
flavor
far
off
in
the
distance
overall
i
have
been
disappointed
by
almost
everything
that
i
have
had
by
arcadia
and
this
beer
isnt
really
an
exception
if
i
compare
it
to
other
porters
such
as
gonzo
would
i
buy
it
again
why
i
could
have
gonzo
instead
o
nice
english
porter
that
goes
down
easy
good
for
the
style
yeah
this
is
great
very
tasty
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
in
a
way
that
i
enjoy
lends
some
character
beautiful
smoke
character
with
being
a
smoked
beer
a
little
more
subtle
o
would
gladly
drink
it
again
it
does
have
some
bitter
qualities
to
it
but
are
not
overpowering
it
has
similar
taste
attributes
to
that
of
scotch
ales

on

are

robust

no
cloying

at

a

very
smooth

for

overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
robust
porter
a
good
amount
of
very
robust
flavors
and
nice
balance
make
this
very
enjoyable
i
would
have
it
again
full
on
roasted
malts
maybe
burnt
in
some
places
coffee
chocolate
and
some
dry
yeasty
tartness
for
an
interesting
depth
of
flavor
chalky
but
silky
palate
easy
to
drink
for
me
i
would
say
sessionable
but
the
abv
doesnt
fit
that
equation
overall
not
your
mommas
porter
more
reminiscent
of
a
scottish
ale
with
the
strong
smoke
and
peat
flavors
a
bit
too
phenolic
for
me
smooth
and
very
gently
crisp
in
a
strong
mediumfull
body
with
a
bit
of
thickness
the
only
thing
detracting
is
that
the
dryness
goes
just
a
touch
chalky
overall
it
has
interesting
smokiness
with
great
drinkability
o
pretty
good
but
doesnt
taste
like
a
typical
porter
if
the
label
didnt
say
otherwise
id
think
scotch
ale
or
even
a
rauchbier
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
d
not
your
usual
chocolate
roast
with
a
handful
of
hops
porter
this
is
the
odp
old
dirty
porter
imensely
flavorful
with
very
notable
smokiness
and
earthiness
burly
with
a
strong
rustic
old
school
flair
to
it
and
i
really
think
that
is
what
they
were
going
for
mission
accomplished
a
distinct
uber
nice
porter
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
ill
try
again
for
7
2
abv
it
goes
down
easy
though
overall
this
is
a
solid
english
porter
its
very
earthy
but
that
may
be
exactly
what
you
want
it
would
go
marvelously
with
a
hamburger
or
a
steak
off
of
the
grill
overall
4
lots
of
great
flavors
but
too
big
for
this
style
imo
the
booziness
really
shows
and
theres
a
lot
of
residual
sugar
which
it
would
be
better
off
without
i
will
drink
this
again
if
only
because
its
unique
tasteupfront
smokiness
then
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
notes
emerge
dry
smoky
finish
nice
flavor
and
balance
an
excellent
match
for
any
bbq
fare
ive
been
wondering
about
this
beer
for
a
while
now
and
thanks
to
this
bliss
tasting
im
finally
getting
a
shot
at
it
it
pours
a
dark
garnetbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
light
molasses
dark
chocolate
powder
clove
black
pepper
and
a
few
blades
of
dry
grass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
bit
more
molasses
some
maple
syrup
and
a
decent
amount
of
beech
smoke
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
very
good
porter
its
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
for
my
liking
but
the
smoke
though
pretty
subtle
really
works
well
with
the
chocolate
roast
and
molasses
elements
good
times
o
nice
all
around
this
beer
could
be
a
go
to
if
it
were
more
available
solid
beer
at
a
decent
price
if
youre
in
the
right
area
o
a
very
tasty
dark
porter
especially
if
you
love
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
that
said
it
is
very
rich
so
drinking
a
full
bottle
is
a
bit
like
trying
to
eat
a
big
slice
of
death
by
chocolate
cake
overall
pretty
decent
but
its
not
exactly
prose
inspiring
the
end
surprisingly
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
englishstyle
porters
i
have
had
o
a
very
nice
brew
from
the
folks
at
arcadia
the
carbonation
makes
it
a
bit
tough
to
get
all
the
flavor
but
overall
a
good
brew
very
smoky
and
that
may
turn
some
folks
off
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
body
is
rich
and
creamy
with
a
faint
oily
character
just
perfect
for
a
porter
on
the
whole
very
nice
indeed
but
the
bitterness
and
a
somewhat
chalky
flavor
on
the
finish
detract
from
what
could
be
nearly
perfect
london
porter
pours
out
a
dark
brown
nearly
black
color
a
thick
head
accompanied
the
pour
but
quickly
disappeared
and
stuck
around
as
very
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
with
fruity
notes
peaking
through
this
beer
is
highly
carbonated
and
unfortunately
that
makes
it
difficult
to
pick
out
flavors
a
somewhat
bitter
chocolate
hits
your
tongue
right
away
but
give
way
to
a
roasted
smokiness
dark
fruits
surface
when
the
chocolate
flavor
fades
and
hints
of
alcohol
pop
up
at
the
very
end
this
dark
dessert
pours
a
dark
amber
color
and
settles
black
with
a
cream
colored
head
barely
any
lacing
the
nose
is
buttery
and
roasted
there
is
some
molasses
there
too
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
there
is
a
tad
bit
of
hops
present
with
some
smoke
molassed
and
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
viscous
for
the
the
style
but
enjoyable
for
sure
overall
a
great
brew
that
is
pushing
the
boundaries
for
the
style
and
pretty
tastey
the
more
i
drank
the
less
i
liked
it
london
style
porter
has
a
very
dark
black
color
its
start
out
with
some
head
and
quickly
disolves
very
soon
smell
is
no
doubt
smoky
chocolate
with
hint
of
dark
roasted
coffee
i
think
as
far
as
taste
dark
chocolate
with
a
smoking
aftertasteand
thats
what
i
was
looking
for
i
could
drink
many
of
these
this
a
smooth
tasting
porterthat
most
likely
ill
drink
again
overall
im
sorry
but
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
flows
over
the
tongue
nicely
but
sticks
just
enough
to
allow
the
flavors
to
really
shine
overall
this
is
a
good
porter
i
think
the
smoke
is
a
little
too
forward
for
my
taste
but
by
the
end
of
the
glass
it
seems
to
blend
in
better
and
i
can
taste
the
other
flavors
better
d
this
is
a
nice
value
beer
robust
porter
for
under
10
a
6
pack
not
something
i
would
purchase
regularly
but
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
out
to
a
blackishbrown
body
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
it
has
little
lacing
some
retention
and
good
carbonation
the
smell
is
cocoa
with
some
coffee
and
caramel
nothing
really
exciting
here
the
taste
is
biter
chocolate
at
fisrt
followed
by
some
coffee
caramel
a
little
hint
of
hops
and
seems
to
have
a
little
bit
of
molasses
in
it
it
also
has
a
slight
smoke
flavor
mixed
in
it
finishes
off
with
more
chocolate
and
has
a
chocolaty
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
but
finishes
off
a
little
on
the
dry
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
that
is
not
quite
as
filling
as
i
would
have
expected
a
pretty
good
porter
but
i
have
tasted
a
few
better
english
style
porters
anyone
that
likes
this
beer
should
try
fullers
london
porter
which
is
even
better
than
this
beer
solid
drink
one
of
my
favorites
from
arcadia
mouthfeel
is
as
smooth
as
can
be
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
unique
brew
when
i
saw
this
was
an
english
porter
i
figured
i
would
be
in
for
a
lighter
hoppy
porter
but
that
was
not
the
case
i
dont
think
i
would
call
this
beer
and
english
porter
but
i
really
dont
know
what
style
it
would
fit
in
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
good
job
at
making
a
unique
porter
arcadia
i
liked
this
porter
but
i
was
ready
to
b
done
with
the
pint
rich
and
strongflavored
it
is
a
true
sipper
another
good
one
from
this
brewer
and
very
worth
the
try
bring
a
driver
at
7
2
the
fact
that
i
could
drink
a
hundred
of
these
is
dangerous
it
drys
up
my
mouth
in
that
good
way
that
makes
me
want
to
sip
sip
sip
looks
good
hanging
on
the
glassfor
you
lacingcatswith
nice
chocolate
the
finsh
hangs
and
your
mouth
wants
more
d
meh
this
beer
isnt
awful
but
it
isnt
great
either
the
chocolate
flavor
is
pretty
good
but
this
beer
just
isnt
quite
there
for
me
yet
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
buy
it
unless
the
other
options
were
extremely
limited
d
no
thanks
f
a
bit
of
warming
booze
throughout
that
comes
out
more
as
it
warms
the
earthy
roasted
charred
bitter
finish
with
some
minerality
lingers
for
a
while
more
charred
roasty
malts
and
perhaps
black
patent
malt
also
linger
for
a
bit
more
chewy
malt
finish
as
well
there
is
also
some
sticky
sweetness
not
quite
what
i
expected
for
an
english
style
porter
but
then
again
it
is
arcadia
so
i
guess
its
more
of
a
west
coast
americanized
english
porter
tasty
nonetheless
but
loses
some
points
for
not
quite
abiding
to
the
style
just
way
too
much
malts
too
much
abv
roasted
flavors
and
minerality
gold
medal
winner
at
2003
world
beer
championship
this
is
a
brew
for
those
who
enjoy
their
craft
beer
slow
and
savor
every
flavor
pleasant
and
dark
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
color
with
not
too
much
foam
the
lack
of
foam
seems
acceptable
for
the
style
mild
maltish
smell
taste
is
quite
good
on
the
bitter
side
but
no
overt
hops
the
london
porter
also
shows
a
nutty
maltiness
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
and
if
you
are
a
porter
fan
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
looks
like
a
regular
porter
dark
opaque
like
coffee
head
was
bubbly
and
tan
in
color
it
dissolved
rather
quickly
though
aroma
was
a
mix
of
alcohol
roasted
malts
and
some
sort
of
sweetness
taste
had
a
mix
of
alcohol
a
raisinchocolate
sweetness
to
it
and
roasted
malt
bitterness
as
well
good
and
thick
but
could
have
used
a
little
more
carbonation
so
it
wouldve
have
felt
like
a
thin
syrup
not
too
heavy
for
a
7
2
abv
so
thats
good
but
the
body
is
too
thick
to
have
multiple
bottles
though
i
might
prefer
less
carbonation
it
does
trick
you
into
thinking
that
this
brew
is
more
sessionable
which
if
you
think
it
then
i
guess
it
is
a
fie
english
porter
and
a
good
contender
to
fullers
d
if
not
for
the
lingering
bitterness
this
would
get
a
perfect
score
its
sort
of
like
if
you
buy
a
5
bar
of
fine
dark
chocolate
youre
not
going
to
eat
the
whole
thing
in
one
night
regardless
of
how
much
you
like
chocolate
its
tasty
but
it
wears
on
you
a
bit
dvery
smooth
goes
down
easy
mouthfeel
is
full
and
complex
with
a
complete
pallet
of
flavors
to
keep
you
interested
from
first
sip
all
the
way
through
to
the
aftertaste
a
great
beer
jonathan
passow
after
seeing
this
brew
for
years
and
reading
good
things
about
it
i
decided
to
pick
it
up
though
i
am
not
sure
why
it
took
so
long
anyway
this
brew
poured
to
a
black
color
with
a
medium
colored
medium
sized
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
and
left
some
good
lacing
a
lot
more
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
showcases
roasted
malts
fruit
scent
of
what
i
think
might
be
plum
with
a
little
raisons
seems
to
give
it
a
slight
sweetness
also
could
be
from
the
slight
chocolate
notes
also
there
is
a
slight
boozinessalcohol
aroma
that
was
a
surprise
but
went
well
while
the
aroma
was
ok
the
flavors
are
much
better
the
malts
give
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
rich
slightly
astringent
in
a
perfect
way
some
molasses
and
caramel
like
flavors
give
a
slight
sweetness
then
it
also
has
a
feel
of
coffee
in
the
background
and
somewhat
at
the
end
of
the
sip
the
feel
is
dry
at
the
end
some
of
that
coffee
flavor
adding
to
that
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
7
2
abv
is
a
surprise
as
it
does
not
really
come
through
in
the
flavor
just
the
nose
nice
brew
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
nice
example
of
the
style
best
beer
they
have
there
i
liked
it
enough
to
get
a
growler
filled
with
it
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
nice
coco
head
to
it
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
almonds
taste
is
great
chocolate
at
the
beginning
and
almonds
at
the
end
with
a
good
after
taste
best
part
of
the
beer
is
the
taste
no
doubt
mouth
feel
was
medium
and
drinkability
was
great
no
problem
finishing
off
this
brew
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
14
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
yeast
slight
hops
and
slight
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
an
english
porter
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slighlty
creamy
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
alcohol
slight
hops
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
overall
a
good
aroma
blend
and
body
d
taste
is
powerful
and
may
become
repetitive
to
some
i
will
be
buying
this
in
the
future
but
in
limited
quantities
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
that
slowly
dissapates
leaving
a
sticky
lacing
behind
aroma
consists
of
toffee
roasted
malt
perhaps
chocolate
and
oatmeal
taste
is
a
very
robust
combination
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
chocolate
toffee
sweetness
very
flavorable
porter
d
its
an
easy
drinker
the
full
flavor
keeps
everything
interesting
enough
for
me
to
want
it
again
12
oz
very
dark
brown
pour
with
a
small
amount
of
tan
bubbles
sticks
to
the
glass
fairly
well
though
roast
malt
earthy
peat
light
coffee
and
chocolates
in
the
aroma

has
more
roast
coffee
and
heavy
roast
malt
some
earthyness
nut
and
bakers
chocolate
hints
of
black
licorice
mouthfeel
not
quite
creamy
very
nice
drinking
porter
no
alcohol
present
really
no
sourness
holding
it
back
may
only
be
a
bit
over
zealousness
with
the
bitters
a
very
good
american
example
of
an
english
porter
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
body
with
hints
of
oatmeal
and
a
tone
of
chocolate
and
caramel
maltiness
very
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
silky
maltiness
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
there
is
some
subtle
licorice
buried
in
there
and
a
slightly
dry
hop
finish
my
only
question
about
this
beer
was
the
sediment
i
found
on
the
bottom
i
know
it
was
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
but
the
sediment
was
like
sawdust
i
wasnt
all
that
thrilled
about
this
overall
i
was
pretty
content
with
this
porter
not
my
favorite
but
drinkable
overall
i
had
to
try
this
to
give
arcadia
another
shot
and
to
compare
to
founders
porter
well
my
view
on
arcadia
stands
i
havent
tasted
anything
from
them
that
blew
me
away
cheers
overall
this
was
a
solid
english
style
porter
that
is
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
higher
abv
pours
a
satisfactory
dark
with
good
carbonation
and
head
smell
is
fantastic
with
roasted
coffee
and
toffee
clearly
present
taste
is
solid
with
the
coffee
tones
and
a
little
toffee
essence
coming
out
on
the
backend
a
little
bit
lightbodied
though
not
to
its
detriment
decently
drinkable
though
the
higher
abv
would
prevent
consumption
of
too
many
in
an
evening
12oz

one
inch
foamy
offwhite

sizzled
and
popped
as
it
slowly

some
slashes

really
smooth

silky

easy

if
it
wasnt
for

abv
this
would
make
a
great
session
porter
d
between
the
unexpected
bitterness
and
the
easily
detected
abv
this
isnt
the
most
accessible
english
porter
still
pretty
tasty
overall
drinkability
i
had
no
problem
finishing
this
porter
and
only
wished
there
was
another
bottle
the
taste
is
complex
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
rather
creamy
with
a
nice
bittering
hop
bite
but
with
plenty
of
abv
to
pack
a
punch
there
is
some
sweet
nuttiness
and
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
the
hop
bite
the
abv
soaked
fruitiness
the
combination
of
charred
and
roasted
malts
and
coffee
flavors
pretty
much
define
this
beer
it
is
a
beer
with
lots
of
character
and
it
doesnt
get
watery
towards
the
finish
a
very
nice
beer
especially
in
cold
weather
with
a
nice
warming
abv
glow
to
it
lchaim
notes
i
will
get
this
again
because
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
perhaps
not
an
exceptional
beer
yet
damn
good
mfeel
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
slightly
sharp
from
carbonation
little
alch
warmth
but
creamy
roundness
overall
mfeel
is
highlight
drinkave
porter
cheap
though
and
no
sign
of
alcohol
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
nearlyopaque
black
the
onefinger
head
showed
good
retention
especially
as
a
collar
and
the
lacing
was
in
curtains
the
aroma
started
with
a
some
sweetness
before
the
darker
elements
i
detected
roasted
malt
light
chocolate
and
light
coffee
notes
the
flavors
were
more
bitter
and
coffeelike
than
the
aroma
suggested
but
they
moved
like
the
aroma
at
first
i
got
the
sweet
elements
of
chocolate
then
the
darker
roasted
malt
smoked
meat
tobacco
wood
leather
and
coffee
notes
the
fuggles
hops
added
their
distinct
bitterness
very
dry
and
robust
like
the
british
sense
of
humor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
rich
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
light
a
well
organized
easily
drinkable
version
of
this
british
style
d
this
was
a
very
good
porter
i
enjoyed
it
throughout
and
really
liked
the
chocolate
tones
that
seemed
to
dominate
the
palate
cheers
overall
this
was
a
really
good
porter
if
it
had
just
a
little
more
body
itd
be
great
still
its
worth
a
shot
ipoured
this
not
very
exciting
looking
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
very
black
to
be
sure
it
had
a
tan
head
with
nice
fine
bubbles
the
smell
was
high
hops
and
a
metallic
smell
the
head
was
dead
fast
which
was
dissapointing
the
taste
however
was
great
a
bit
of
coffee
not
too
hoppy
and
not
metallic
i
will
buy
again
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
strong
porter
of
7
2
abv
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
that
quick
the
feel
is
pretty
thick
for
the
style
but
that
can
be
a
good
thing
a
really
great
amplified
version
of
an
english
porter
to
appease
american
porter
drinkers
what
a
treat
d
an
excellent
porter
and
a
great
value
too
arcadia
is
a
bit
hit
or
miss
overall
but
this
one
is
a
great
brew
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
medium
brown
finely
bubbled
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
wow
very
odd
i
dont
know
if
i
like
it
and
its
not
easy
to
describe
my
after
the
fifth
whiff
i
began
to
adjust
and
noted
the
following
a
lot
of
worthers
butterscotch
and
heaps
of
vanilla
completely
inconsistent
with
what
i
expected
of
a
porter
but
defining
the
aroma
of
this
beer
nonetheless
also
smells
of
moist
coffee
grounds
most
peculiar
im
gonna
give
it
a
4
5
for
a
combination
of
its
shock
factor
and
complexity
same
score
on
the
taste
too
many
flavors
to
handle
all
at
once
theres
a
sourness
that
ive
rarely
tasted
in
a
beer
particularly
a
dark
one
before
the
dark
chocolate
expresso
and
burnt
wood
are
all
expected
but
the
sourness
is
really
interesting
medium
to
full
body
is
well
crafted
definitely
one
that
i
will
be
buying
again
and
again
too
rich
and
tasty
and
bitter
to
chug
but
id
be
happy
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
alcohol
only
shows
itself
in
the
form
of
esters
dangerous
drinkability
easily
one
of
my
favorite
new
beers
cheers
and
im
proud
that
yet
another
outstanding
brewery
has
emerged
from
my
home
state
their
english
ipa
kicks
butt
too
now
if
we
can
just
get
bells
to
distribute
in
massachusetts
notes
from

pours
a
dark
brown
stream
through
light
but
when
in
a
glass
it
seems
black
the
head
forms
a
thin
sheet
of
milk
chocolate
and
recedes
to
a
small
ring
smells
sweet
kinda
like
coffee
but
a
nice
smokiness
sits
behind
that
taste
is
pretty
great
its
kinda
thin
in
the
mouth
but
a
good
balanced
beer
tastes
of
bittersweet
chocolate
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
and
finishes
smooth
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
very
enjoyable
and
recommended
d
way
better
than
i
remember
this
is
like
a
chocolate
milkshake
it
is
a
bit
rich
but
wow
damn
tasty
d
big
hearty
rich
and
interesting
with
a
good
amount
of
coffee
makes
this
a
dark
rich
treat
to
behold
lighter
mouthfeel
but
the
heavy
malt
and
firm
alcohol
content
provide
a
fuller
feeling
faint
carbonation
from
the
bottle
conditioning
probably
intended
to
mimic
cask
conditioning
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
the
same
as
cask
but
it
will
do
fine
drinkable
given
the
alcohol
content
the
mouthfeel
and
soft
subtle
flavors
allow
this
to
be
an
easy
sipper
recommended
even
if
it
isnt
world
class
deasy
to
drink
ill
have
this
one
again
mouth
is
rich
and
smooth
a
tingling
in
the
side
of
the
mouth
is
nice
easily
drinkable
a
great
session
no
doubt
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
better
porters
out
there
but
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
mfd
creamy
and
full
bodied
a
good
example
of
this
style
pours
a
rich
black
color
with
a
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
taste
follows
well
with
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
nice
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
have
a
few
but
its
relatively
high
abv
limits
its
drinkability
overall
a
great
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
arcadia
brews
in
the
future
not
a
bad
porter
just
odd
with
the
mineral
taste
just
not
for
me
i
guess
body
is
medium
creamy
and
very
smooth
light
but
persistant
carbonation
lend
to
a
lush
velvety
mouthfeel
intense
flavor
in
a
very
sessionable
body
make
this
a
dangerously
drinkable
brew
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
that
ive
tried
nice
porter
and
enjoyable
to
drink
a
little
too
aggressive
with
the
hops
for
an
english
porter
much
more
of
an
american
vibe
deep
dark
brown
with
some
amber
tint
nice
pillowey
light
brown
head
leaving
minimal
lacing
looks
great
aroma
is
roasty
and
sweet
with
a
powerful
chocolate
scent
backed
by
some
bitter
coffee
a
very
full
bodied
beer
mouthfeel
is
thick
smooth
and
creamy
flavor
is
off
the
charts
with
a
heavy
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
prominence
there
is
a
little
bit
of
roasted
smokiness
as
well
but
not
as
forward
as
i
was
expecting
incredible
beer
here
will
look
for
it
again
d
very
solid
brew
highly
recommended
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
almost
black
brown
one
finger
head
was
chocolate
brown
in
color
and
lasted
about
5
mins
leaving
a
ring
around
the
top
aroma
was
sweet
and
fruity
at
times
reminded
me
of
bananas
and
other
times
of
cherry
chocolate
taste
was
equally
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
kind
of
like
a
piece
of
semi
sweet
and
70
dark
chocolate
at
once
type
of
sweetness
slight
bit
of
acidness
in
the
mouth
which
detracted
from
the
mouthfeel
but
coated
fairly
well
mostly
easy
to
drink
but
the
slight
bitterness
and
acidity
hurt
d
the
heaviness
of
the
flavors
keeps
this
one
in
check
as
it
should
for
a
relatively
high
abv
for
the
style
beer
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
chilly
evening
this
is
an
exceptional
porter
the
flavor
is
so
complex
and
the
combination
of
elements
so
rich
that
it
is
hard
to
envision
a
better
example
of
this
style
wow
im
wondering
if
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
the
freshness
info
on
the
bottle
is
rather
cryptic
one
notch
for
the
letters
ag
and
one
for
the
numbers
06
why
cant
more
breweries
just
stick
to
actual
dates
anyway
my
bottle
is
notched
f5
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
somewhat
small
head
smell
is
mostly
malt
with
a
smoky
quality
and
some
hops
undertones
taste
is
roasted
malt
coffee
and
hops
quite
good
mouthfeel
is
dry
with
a
nice
slightly
tart
finish
because
of
this
nice
dryness
drinkability
is
very
good
pours
almost
black
with
some
transluscency
to
it
and
some
ruby
edges
smell
is
roasy
and
an
almost
cinnamony
spiced
scent
too
some
cardboard
like
aroma
too
taste
is
dark
rich
and
roast
coffeelike
without
the
spiced
characteristic
so
much
somewhat
rich
body
for
the
style
and
pretty
drinkable
nice
porter
d
excellent
a
true
standout
of
the
style
might
have
been
skunked
need
to
try
this
again
to
see
if
its
really
as
good
as
everyone
else
thinks
especially
since
i
loved
the
other
arcadia
brews
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
black
opaque
with
a
thin
creamy
looking
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
almost
like
a
milk
stout
but
also
has
roasted
notes
like
coffee
and
chocolate
slightly
smoky
the
first
thing
that
pops
out
at
me
in
the
taste
is
also
smoke
not
really
bitter
from
the
roasted
notes
as
i
had
expected
really
very
smooth
and
slightly
malty
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
substantial
carbonation
that
has
a
bubbly
consistency
the
drinkability
of
this
is
pretty
high
due
to
the
balanced
nature
of
the
beer
much
better
than
i
had
expected
thumbs
up
to
arcadia
for
this
gem
drinkability
for
a
smoked
porter
this
one
runs
down
a
pretty
tricky
path
as
it
comes
out
more
sour
that
smoked
that
may
be
a
function
of
age
for
even
though
i
just
bought
the
bottle
i
cannot
decipher
the
code
b0
d
a
nice
american
interpretation
of
an
english
porter
w
a
bit
more
strength
and
american
style
w
nice
british
malt
and
yeast
profile
very
good
drinkability
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
in
the
past
autumn
season
had
arcadias
jawjacker
which
i
really
liked
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
their
london
porter
and
this
sample
didnt
disappoint
certainly
lived
up
to
its
hype
a
very
impressive
darkblack
opaque
jet
hue
with
an
incredible
foamy
and
frothy
head
that
exhibited
some
staying
power
smell
is
ultrasweet
with
cocoa
espresso
and
darkbrown
sugarlike
notes
taste
is
laden
with
candiedsugars
latteflavor
and
dark
burnt
chocolate
essence
very
thick
rich
and
creamy
taste
with
noticeable
typical
porternotes
coming
through
a
slightly
medicinal
sweet
sugarladen
flavor
slightly
overbearing
with
its
strong
flavor
this
one
is
really
s
strong
in
taste
with
an
ultracreamy
rich
mouthfeel
drinkability
was
about
average
because
of
the
dominating
flavor
and
taste
certainly
worth
a
try
the
taste
brings
it
all
together
very
wellplenty
of
coffee
but
much
morecaramel
in
all
its
smooth
goodness
chocolate
and
also
hints
of
sweet
fruit
mixed
in
its
excellent
however
this
is
a
bit
flat
even
for
porter
all
in
all
though
this
is
a
fine
porter
very
delicious
not
one
of
the
very
best
ive
had
but
rather
good
roasted
malts
and
herbal
hops
greet
the
tongue
rich
chocolate
sweetness
and
peat
malt
take
over
roasted
bitterness
hangs
around
in
the
background
hints
of
sasparilla
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
roasty
herbal
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mediumfull
body
with
a
slightly
oily
feel
very
good
this
may
be
arcadias
best
full
time
offering
mouthfeel
has
a
fantastic
creamy
quality
to
it
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
abv
is
well
hidden
so
it
sneaks
up
on
you
by
the
third
or
fourth
round
very
good
porter
indeed
drinkability
is
fine
as
it
goes
as
their
signature
entrylevel
porter
however
arcadia
should
lower
the
abv
to
the
5
5
range
i
like
big
beers
periodically
but
i
dont
understand
the
need
to
push
the
regular
beer
lineup
into
the
imperial
range
even
if
they
dont
use
the
moniker
still
i
have
yet
to
find
the
equal
to
fullers
london
porter
eric
pours
opaque
with
a
darker
tan
head
some
roasted
chocolate
tones
on
the
nose
after
time
there
seems
to
be
a
good
bit
of
dark
chocolate
on
there
as
well
seemed
a
bit
mild
at
first
especially
compared
to
some
of
the
outrageous
baltic
porters
i
have
had
the
chance
to
try
in
the
past
but
it
opened
up
over
time
flavor
is
thick
with
malts
a
touch
of
sweetness
kicking
in
on
the
end
slight
roasted
tones
on
the
flavor
as
well
mostly
though
thick
malt
qualities
abound
here
feel
is
thick
with
a
low
carbonation
overall
extremely
drinkable
smooth
and
rich
try
it
i
would
put
this
up
against
any
of
the
great
baltic
porters
of
europe
the
only
thing
that
they
might
outdo
this
one
in
is
the
nose
over
time
this
one
gets
just
better
and
better
as
it
warms
amazing
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
chimay
chalice
to
be
completely
honest
i
think
this
is
the
first
porter
i
have
wholly
enjoyed
i
have
a
tendency
to
stay
away
from
the
style
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
apples
and
cloves
taste
is
just
as
complicated
with
hints
of
chocolates
dark
fruits
and
maybe
something
like
bourbon
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
expected
quite
a
drinkable
porter
d
i
could
drink
an
awful
lot
of
this
beer
in
fact
if
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
thats
what
id
be
doing
right
now
it
has
higher
than
average
abv
but
you
wouldnt
know
from
the
taste
goes
down
real
easy
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
a
surprisingly
good
porter
well
done
d
this
is
one
hell
of
a
porter
i
really
wasnt
expecting
any
more
than
an
average
brew
but
this
is
exquisite
12
oz
brown
bottle
conditioned
brewed
with
english
2row
and
pacific
northwest
hops
served
in
a
chalice
clear
and
ohso
close
to
black
topped
with
a
rather
thin
lightbrown
head
but
the
carbonation
eventually
works
up
a
nice
layer
of
foam
pleasant
aroma
with
roasted
chocolate
hints
of
fig
and
coffee
and
a
mild
backing
of
hops
on
the
palate
it
is
almost
fullyattenuated
and
quite
bitter
from
the
hops
and
burntcharred
malts
but
it
has
a
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
underneath
adding
to
this
is
a
big
coffee
bite
tobacco
leather
dark
semisweet
chocolate
and
some
floralpiney
hops
hiding
beneath
the
body
is
medium
mouthcoating
low
in
carbonation
and
it
imparts
a
long
finish
overall
it
tastes
kinda
like
a
standard
us
stout
to
me
but
thats
fine
as
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
improves
as
it
warms
with
bitterness
subsiding
and
flavor
increasing
however
i
think
this
beer
could
use
a
touch
of
sweetness
tossed
into
the
mix
d
enjoyable
porter
with
a
lot
of
flavor
decent
complexity
and
a
sturdy
quaffability
a
different
porter
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
other
porters
pretty
dry
on
the
finish
and
again
chalky
in
the
end
as
well
d
a
nice
solid
beer
that
is
better
then
the
sum
of
its
parts
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
porter
it
looked
and
smelled
great
the
taste
was
nice
too
the
body
is
solid
overall
but
the
initial
acidity
almost
gives
the
illusion
that
its
thinner
than
it
actually
is
its
a
pretty
tasty
porter
but
its
not
reminiscent
of
any
english
porter
ive
had
does
thin
a
bit
by
midbottle
but
overall
a
solid
performer
pours
an
almost
black
ruby
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
smells
medicinal
with
a
very
subtle
roast
taste
is
of
sour
coffee
and
a
little
roasty
medium
in
the
mouth
with
a
little
carbonation
sting
had
to
take
my
time
on
this
one
and
wasnt
reaching
for
another
when
it
was
done
this
porter
is
a
dark
color
with
just
a
hint
of
light
there
is
a
fair
sized
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
herbal
smell
along
with
toasted
grain
the
taste
is
roasted
oatmeal
and
other
grain
along
with
a
herbal
taste
mouthfeel
is
fair
and
drinkability
is
ok
lots
of
strange
flavors
here
and
overall
i
am
not
too
impressed
i
would
likely
not
revisit
this
beer
nice
drinkable
session
porter
perfect
for
the
new
and
much
wanted
autumn
crisp
in
the
evenings
finishes
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
along
with
the
roasted
bitterness
also
unusual
for
an
english
porter
but
very
nice
this
could
be
one
of
my
favorite
porters
drinkability
good
beer
nice
flavor
balance
make
this
a
good
porter
would
recommend
a
purchase
of
at
least
a
bottle
or
two
would
not
go
through
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
though
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
towering
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
below
average
it
has
an
extremely
sour
aroma
it
has
a
dark
malt
presence
roasted
chocolate
patent
but
its
to
contaminated
to
tell
exactly
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
nice
roasted
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
but
it
finishes
dry
and
sour
with
a
lingering
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
below
average
beer
its
spoiled
and
ruined
with
contamination
it
tastes
like
a
porter
riddles
with
lambic
yeast
black
color
medium
body
very
complex
aroma
and
tasteroasted
malt
bitter
and
sour
none
of
the
sweetness
but
with
all
the
flavors
of
many
imperial
stouts
best
arcadia
brew
that
ive
tried
this
like
most
porters
is
overlooked
sour
overtone
which
is
very
much
in
line
with
original
porters
which
included
sour
leftover
beer
less
than
9
for
a
6pack
drinkability
this
is
excellent
ale
and
is
low
enough
in
abv
to
be
entirely
sessionable
very
hearty
and
delicious
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
get
on
tap
wellbalanced
with
big
malty
flavors
ill
have
to
be
more
careful
with
the
yeast
the
next
time
i
drink
it
out
of
a
bottle
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
toffeecaramel
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
roasted
there
is
a
sweetbittertangy
thing
going
on
quite
different
than
other
baltic
porters
ive
had
the
finish
is
dry
medium
body
very
drinkable
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
also
i
have
an
extra
bottle
this
is
also
my
first
arcadia
brew
but
i
have
alot
of
others
to
review
overall
arcadia
has
some
hits
and
misses
with
me
this
one
is
more
of
a
miss
i
think
the
flavours
on
this
one
are
more
subdued
than
i
would
like
for
the
style
and
it
strikes
me
as
one
of
the
weaker
locally
brewed
porters
hence
its
unlikely
that
ill
buy
it
again
a
very
nice
baltic
porter
and
just
a
good
porter
period
its
nicely
complex
and
very
well
crafted
for
balance
would
pair
well
with
a
nice
steak
some
spicy
stew
meat
potatoes
or
some
dry
white
cheddar
would
drink
again
with
zero
hesitation
give
it
a
shot
very
easy
to
drink
great
porter
will
be
looking
for
more
of
this
d
very
approachable
and
sessionable
porter
would
have
liked
some
more
roastiness
for
whatever
reason
i
have
passed
on
this
beer
many
times
when
back
home
man
what
was
i
thinkingpoured
a
near
pitch
black
only
a
few
hints
of
ruby
thruout
a
tight
almost
creamy
mocha
colored
head
leaving
a
sheet
of
lace
as
it
settled
slowly
atop
so
much
going
on
in
the
nose
and
palate
of
this
beer
its
amazing
molassesdark
roast
coffeebitter
chocolatefruitand
even
a
hint
of
mint
not
mention
some
smokiness
complex
flavors
from
beginning
to
finish
with
a
creamy
mouthfeeldark
roast
coffee
with
a
more
pronounced
smoky
elemant
with
some
molasses
and
unsweetened
chocolate
melding
into
a
leafyherbal
finish
easily
the
best
arcadia
brewed
beer
in
my
mind
just
awesome
notes
earthiness
reminds
me
of
a
blue
roquefort
cheese
try
it
as
a
pairing
into
a
nonic
pours
a
dark
brown
black
with
some
tan
head
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
coffee
and
roasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
perhaps
some
lactose
sneaking
in
the
taste
is
dark
bitter
chocolates
the
mouth
smooth
and
creamy
in
all
not
a
bad
porter
but
forgettable
in
my
book
overall
not
too
shabby
an
enjoyable
porter
worth
the
2
oelergud
mouthfeel
was
mediumthin
mild
pinpoint
carbonation
very
nice
indeed
d
a
good
solid
example
of
the
style
not
an
overpowering
flavor
definetly
a
drinker
d
my
only
complaint
of
this
beer
is
that
i
wish
it
was
thicker
and
creamier
to
match
the
aroma
and
taste
otherwise
this
beer
is
outstanding
taste
is
a
fruity
coffee
so
to
speak
the
coffee
melts
into
a
cocao
flavor
which
is
attached
to
some
fruit
finishes
nice
and
dry
not
much
aftertaste
which
is
good
not
bad
but
just
too
buttery
and
sweet
without
a
certain
flavor
for
me
the
fruitiness
doesnt
seem
to
go
as
well
as
i
would
like
with
the
coffee
i
would
not
have
guessed
this
to
be
a
baltic
porter
as
there
is
no
indication
of
this
on
the
label
expected
a
lower
more
sessionable
brew
though
i
like
the
style
so
really
not
complaining
and
given
that
the
alcohol
is
pretty
wellhidden
there
are
other
baltic
porters
i
would
easily
choose
over
this
one
poured
an
opaque
and
shiny
with
a
dark
brown
color
a
soapy
tan
colored
head
quickly
develops
and
leaves
behind
a
splash
of
lacing
aromas
of

thanks

would

having

of
this
again
seems
miscategorized
on

as

more
a

dark

with

thanks
to

a

of

did
not

the
amount
had
in
one
session
recommended
d
great
porter
for
someone
who
wants
to
get
in
to
porters
very
approachable
with
great
coffee
flavors
and
a
bit
of
mocha
to
boot
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
that
is
full
flavored
dark
and
roasty
a
good
porter
and
certainly
worth
a
try
but
there
are
much
better
offerings
out
there
if
youre
looking
for
a
true
baltic
porter
pours
the
darkest
of
brownswith
a
slight
redish
hue
smell
is
nice
but
a
bit
weaker
than
i
would
have
liked
roasted
maltsand
coffee
are
the
strongest
body
is
medium
and
smooth
taste
is
smooth
too
but
with
a
bite
dark
fruitsand
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
dark
chocolateand
coffee
excellent
i
cant
say
that
i
was
unimpressed
with
this
one
as
overall
it
was
fairly
enjoyable
id
call
it
more
so
underwhelmed
by
an
unspectacular
brew
it
needs
to
be
beefed
up
a
bit
in
a
few
areas
i
cant
discourage
you
from
buying
it
but
i
can
say
that
ive
had
many
that
are
better
its
a
slightly
above
average
brew
overall
by
my
standards
label
on
bottle
is
marked
as
d4
and
also
some
alcohol
warming
too
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
slightly
dry
with
a
good
syrupy
feel
that
makes
the
mouth
water
for
more
an
execllent
porter
but
its
still
pretty
good
i
could
see
this
being
much
better
in
the
right
situation
like
on
a
cold
snowy
day

overall
a
decent
australian
take
on
the
english
porter
the
usual
flavours
of
chocolate
and
roast
coffee
with
a
touch
of
liquorice
and
caramel
to
boot
the
price
is
right
at
around
au58
a
case
but
a
slightly
fuller
body
could
have
improved
it
somewhat
nonetheless
an
easydrinking
reasonable
beer
o
very
drinkable
beer
nice
take
on
the
style
overall
a
solid
english
style
porter
moderate
flavour
overall
doesnt
build
doesnt
overtake
itself
good
beerdrinkers
beer
not
the
worst
of
the
js
offerings
either
a
pretty
average
porter
nothing
there
to
offend
but
not
much
to
get
hyped
up
about
pretty
modest
dependable
and
reasonably
sessionable
on
tap
at
the
generous
squire
in
perth
very
dark
body
with
a
reasonably
dense
head
aromas
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
the
coffee
flavour
hits
first
followed
by
toast
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
not
bad
mouthful
is
a
touch
thin
and
fizzy
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
malt
shovel
lightly
carbonated
dark
beer
with
little
to
no
head
perhaps
because
i
poured
it
straight
from
the
fridge
smells
metallic
and
minerally
nice
smoky
burnt
caramel
flavours
hint
of
chocolate
and
strong
coffee
aftertaste
somewhat
sour
on
the
tongue
and
not
very
sweet
i
feel
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
other
beers
in
the
james
squire
range
o
for
such
flashy
advertising
i
find
this
beer
fails
to
deliver
the
goods
mainly
the
level
of
robustness
was
hugely
lacking
as
was
the
mouthfeel
in
relation
to
the
style
it
wasnt
a
disaster
or
anything
just
a
bit
underwhelming
pours
chunky
nice
medium
chocolate
brown
stout
like
on
the
nose
with
roasted
notes
flavours
promised
on
the
nose
dont
really
translate
but
still
drinks
ok
a
touch
too
fizzy
for
my
liking
js
should
have
done
better
imho
wont
be
back
for
this
a
brew
that
has
a
lot
going
for
it
but
also
could
have
done
a
lot
more
the
flavors
are
very
nice
but
are
a
bit
muted
and
the
mouthfeel
is
off
still
a
fine
little
porter
and
an
easy
drinker
would
certainly
have
another
overall
decent
but
i
prefer
a
fuller
bodied
porter
with
less
carbonation
i
think
perhaps
australias
warm
weather
accounts
for
the
thinner
bubblier
variation
on
this
type
of
porter
or
perhaps
im
just
giving
a
mediocre
beer
too
much
credit
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
tried
from
malt
shovel
brewing
and
while
it
wasnt
an
outstanding
porter
it
was
quite
nice
and
went
down
easily
id
surely
have
another
but
that
said
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
choose
it
over
some
of
the
others
ive
had
its
a
drinkable
beer
that
im
ever
so
slightly
suspicious
of
at
least
its
something
worthy
of
drinking
when
all
your
other
options
are
variations
on
tooheys
new
probably
my
pick
of
the
bunch
from
the
james
squire
range
havent
had
this
in
yearsgood
to
see
it
hasnt
changed
much
a
really
nice
pleasant
chocolate
driven
nose
backed
by
a
touch
of
roasted
coffee
like
most
js
beers
this
is
a
beer
for
the
punters
enough
to
keep
a
geek
happy
and
not
too
far
out
to
scare
off
joe
average
a
good
medium
bodied
medium
bittered
dark
beer
with
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
goes
down
just
fine
this
cool
evening
love
the
colour
of
this
one
very
dark
chocolate
with
a
nice
white
head
typical
porter
smell
arguably
it
is
not
as
complex
as
a
good
porter
should
be
but
it
has
nice
chocolate
notes
and
i
rate
it
highly
for
its
drinkability
and
sessional
qualities
there
are
probably
better
choices
but
considering
price
and
availability
this
is
a
standout
carbonation
is
a
bit
excessive
and
the
body
is
a
bit
watery
overall
middle
of
the
road
porter
with
good
enough
taste
though
not
as
complex
as
the
label
would
have
you
believe
worth
checking
out
one
of
my
favourite
beers
an
outstanding
porter
ive
rated
based
on
drinking
the
beer
out
of
the
bottle
but
its
exceptional
on
tap
tried
it
at
james
squire
brewery
alehouse
at
the
docklands
when
i
was
in
melbourne
best
beer
ive
ever
had
on
tap
phenomenal
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
cola
colour
with
good
carbonation
that
leaves
one
finger
head
with
subtle
lacing
here
and
thereit
has
aromas
of
malted
chocolate
and
some
subtle
hopsit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
vanillachocolatecoffee
and
malted
barley
with
a
feint
touch
of
hopsthis
is
not
a
bad
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
but
have
had
better
takes
on
the
style
thats
for
sure
alright
but
not
amazing
i
prefer
james
squires
pale
ale
pretty
good
a
decent
winter
time
beverage
id
probably
rather
a
stout
though
im
sure
this
would
be
a
good
choice
to
break
things
up
a
little
bit
probably
best
to
give
this
one
a
miss
d
sessionable
abv
tasty
enough
and
not
so
thick
as
to
be
a
challenge
this
is
quite
drinkable
taste
is
roasty
and
a
bit
gritty
like
badly
dissolved
coffee
a
bit
weak
really
unpleasant
finish
like
yeah
badly
dissolved
coffee
mouthfeel
is
nice
quite
full
bodied
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
the
style
apologies
for
a
very
unimaginative
review
but
i
really
think
this
is
a
very
middleoftheroad
beer
quite
unimaginative
as
a
beer
pours
a
dark
chocolate
in
colour
with
a
creamy
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
very
chocolatey
and
sweet
smoky
chocolate
flavours
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
nice
mouthfeel
with
light
fizz
not
a
bad
drop
i
love
porters
as
they
have
alot
of
the
intensity
of
stouts
but
are
lighter
easier
this
was
a
good
porter
for
sure
love
the
old
porter
style
pours
a
very
dark
amberbrown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
looks
like
a
porter
aromas
of
dried
fruit
dates
coffee
with
a
slight
astringency
tastes
of
the
same
dried
fruit
plus
a
really
lovely
burntsugar
sweetness
some
soapiness
toward
the
end
slightly
dirty
aftertaste
according
to
my
notes
verrrry
nice
highly
drinkable
moreish
not
too
complex
to
want
another
round
best
beer
i
drank
in
australia
very
nice
london
style
porter
rare
to
see
an
aussie
made
one
too
and
at
a
sessionable
well
23
at
a
time
alcohol
level
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
which
quickly
receded
the
smell
was
a
bit
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
and
mocha
as
it
warmed
the
aroma
of
soy
sauce
started
to
come
through
taste
was
also
a
bit
sweet
with
a
bit
of
toastiness
medium
bodied
with
tight
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
porter
to
keep
drinking
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
deep
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
medium
bodied
cream
head
that
diminished
very
shortly
after
the
pour
this
brew
had
a
strong
smell
of
wild
cherry
and
coco
and
coffee
notes
the
flavor
was
heavily
chocolate
and
had
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
there
was
also
a
sweetness
that
was
unexpected
this
had
a
moderate
carbonation
which
fit
the
brew
well
nice
work
overall
i
may
be
quite
biased
towards
porters
but
they
taste
so
good
that
i
cant
help
giving
them
high
scores
this
beer
is
no
exception
d
tasty
and
sessionable
porter
for
these
colder
months
another
very
good
beer
from
james
squire
this
is
easier
drinking
and
more
interesting
to
taste
than
most
stouts
there
is
a
small
premium
over
mainstream
beers
but
for
the
quality
you
get
it
is
more
than
worth
it
this
is
an
excellent
beer
for
winters
nights
as
it
gives
a
real
warming
feeling
unusual
for
a
beer
than
is
not
particularly
high
in
alcohol
d
this
beer
is
pretty
thin
for
a
porter
and
the
flavor
and
smell
if
very
light
it
is
smooth
drinking
but
not
much
of
interest
is
going
on
served
with
a
nice
small
head
and
some
lace
very
dark
almost
opaque
brown
nose
is
dark
malt
a
little
dark
fruit
a
little
hop
a
little
yeast
perhaps
some
coffee
and
roastiness
flavors
the
same
but
with
some
significant
sourness
just
a
little
too
much
velvety
texture
drinkable
nice
beer
very
drinkable
fairly
light
and
at
an
average
alcohol
content
the
squire
makes
a
great
session
ale
for
a
night
out
with
the
lads
or
as
accompaniment
to
a
casual
dinner
with
the
wife
or
girlfriend
of
which
squire
had
many
sireing
at

11
children
through
3
women
and
although
no
children
were
had
that
doesnt
include
his
last
affair
easy
to
drink
would
have
to
get
my
store
to
order
it
in

overall
impression
middle
of
the
road
porter
for
the
price
most
shops
here
charge
there
are

better
options
james
squires
amber
ale
remains
my
favourite
from
malt
shovel
brewery
with
golden
ale
in
a
close
second
while
i
can
appreciate
that
this
is
a
quality
brew
im
forced
to
give
it
a
poor
review
due
to
my
dislike
for
coffee
and
the
fact
beer
shouldnt
take
like
beef
i
think
its
a
great
beer
from
james
squire
would
love
to
see
their
take
on
a
stout
some
time
a
great
take
on
this
beer
is
their
seasonal
rum
rebellion
porter
it
introduces
a
more
exciting
element
to
the
beer
to
add
to
all
of
the
subtle
descriptions
above
i
may
be
a
bit
harsh
on
the
mouthfeel
score
but
i
may
readjust
when
i
find
out
just
what
consistency
a
porter
should
have
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
from
a
fairly
small
beer
the
shelf
life
of
imports
at
the
place
where
i
bought
this
isnt
exactly
great
and
so
this
is
probably
even
better
if
drank
fresh
a
true
treat
this
one
has
its
ups
and
downs
but
it
is
tasty
enough
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
it
also
perhaps
a
little
onedimensional
theres
not
much
to
it
other
than
the
roasted
coffee
not
that
thats
necessarily
a
bad
thing
of
course
mouthfeel
was
more
subtle
than
i
expected
which
also
goes
for
what
i
thought
of
this
beer
overall
its
almost
like
a
blackhole
and
the
aroma
and
flavor
just
cant
escape
it
maybe
its
so
good
it
wants
it
all
to
itslef
dont
know
not
bad
but
ill
try
something
different
next
time
the
guy
att
he
bottleshop
said
it
was
great
on
tap
maybe
a
porter
that
goes
down
very
easily
its
very
hard
to
stop
at
one
drinks
okay
not
rich
enough
to
meet
my
expectations
of
a
porter
but
better
than
lets
say
tohoeys
sp
dark
still
havent
found
anything
better
than
cooper
from
oz
would
love
to
try
this
on
its
home
turf
i
suppose
a
good
introductory
porter
because
there
is
really
nothing
offensive
nor
anything
that
stands
out
in
this
brew
just
very
watered
down
imho
mostly
it
is
the
very
very
thin
mouthfeel
that
puts
me
off
of
this
porter
deep
brown
deep
well
cooked
brownies
in
the
nose
along
with
other
roasted
and
toasted
malt
elements
chocolate
coffee
tastes
of
roasted
barley
and
its
attributes
chocolate
cocoa
and
coffee
along
with
a
distinct
burnt
malt
element
notes
of
marshmellow
and
vanilla
and
a
subtle
hop
job
a
tasty
little
brew
on
a
saturday
night
drinkabilityoverall
very
very
easy
to
drink
porter
great
beer
my
first
porter
and
i
will
have
again
for
sure
the
beer
pours
a
rich
brown
color
with
clear
ruby
highlights
there
is
a
small
tan
head
of
1
cm
that
fades
to
an
edge
layer
leaves
tight
lattice
as
it
recedes
aroma
is
chocolate
and
toffee
with
no
hops
anywhere
to
be
found
i
find
the
nose
very
appealing
first
sip
reveals
a
velvety
smooth
body
and
fine
carbonation
that
rolls
across
mh
palate
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
some
toffee
up
front
that
rolls
to
chocolate
and
finishes
just
a
bit
roasty
very
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
beer
quite
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
smooth
with
just
the
right
balance
of
bitter
hops
well
done
i
should
think
that
it
would
drink
well
over
a
reasonable
period
of
time
the
initial
taste
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
thanks
to
the
coffee
and
bakers
chocolatelike
a
good
try
at
a
porter
ive
had
better
but
ive
certainly
had
worse
overall
comments
enjoyable
but
disappointing
in
the
way
that
biting
into
a
snickers
and
getting
a
milky
way
would
be
disappointing
less
black
malt
and
lots
more
chocolate
malt
might
improve
this
beer
dramatically
bottle
almost
black
with
ruby
tints
when
held
to
the
light
fairly
ordinary
light
tan
head
even
when
poured
hard
although
plenty
of
lacing
was
left
behind
as
the
bottom
of
the

approached
aroma
somewhat
disappointing
slight
hint
of
roasted
malt
with
a
little
milkiness
which
improves
slightly
as
it

taste
is
somewhat
better
very
mildly
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
with
a
slightly
dry
and
warming
finish
mouth
is
watery
not
what
it
could
be
i
suspect
sounds
a
bit
like
i
am
down
on
this
one
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
guess
it
could
be
summed
up
with
good
effort
could
do
better
not
too
carbonated
however
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
notes
not
bad
a
little
on
the
weak
side
in
terms
of
flavor
but
it
is
easy
drinking
dissapointed
by
how
thin
the
beer
was
a
unimpressive
beer
this
one
had
potential
with
its
nice
dark
brown
color
decent
head
and
nice
smell
but
the
taste
was
just
average
with
some
slight
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
comming
through
the
beer
would
get
a
higher
rating
if
it
were
not
for
the
horrible
mouthfeel
thin
watery
and
over
carbonated
this
nearly
ruined
the
beer
pass
a
light
drinkable
porter
it
is
close
to
a
porter
soda
in
nature
not
a
connoisseurs
beer
but
a
refreshing
darker
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
but
not
quite
black
like
stout
the
aroma
is
of
faint
coffeemocha
it
tastes
very
chocolatey
and
slightly
like
coffee
very
sweet
no
discernable
hop
flavorscents
at
all
its
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
tasty
brew
but
probably
not
one
you
could
drink
on
a
hot
day
or
all
the
time
but
its
great
on
a
cold
night
like
tonite
overall
a
completely
umremarkable
brew
the
flavors
just
didnt
seem
to
get
together
as
well
as
in
other
brews
of
the
style
nothing
to
wake
up
the
neighbors
about
poured
light
black
deep
red
colors
with
a
thin
white
head
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
malted
aromas
dominate
very
light
feeling
in
the
mouth
for
a
porter
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
roasted
malt
taste
is
light
with
a
lingering
bitter
finish
just
not
enough
complex
malts
to
be
a
great
porter
there
are
better
porters
in
this
region
let
alone
the
world
its
not
really
an
accurate
description
of
the
style
still
its
an
inoffensively
pleasant
beer
thats
not
a
bad
starting
point
for
locals
who
want
to
drink
dark
beers
that
arent
guinness
both
this
and
the
ipa
by
squires
are
a
little
underdone
in
terms
of
style
would
love
to
see
this
with
a
little
more
oomph
notes
totally
forgettable
if
not
somewhat
offputting
deep
chestnut
brown
colored
with
a
thick
frothy
head
excellent
lacing
with
this
brew
aroma
is
similar
to
a
dry
stout
chocolaty
with
a
good
raosted
malt
aroma
flavor
is
lacking
a
bit
as
it
seems
to
me
a
bit
thin
and
watery
overall
not

use
a

some

w

the
carbonation
has
a
bit
of
bite
on
the
tongue
a
better
than
average
porter
but
nothing
spectacular
it
poured
with
an
incredible
head
with
excellent
retention
settling
slowly
in
a
matrix
of
dimples
ths
combined
with
the
dark
brown
slightly
reddish
color
made
for
an
excellent
appearance
it
presented
a
slightly
smoky
toasty
chocolate
aroma
these
characteristics
were
echoed
strongly
in
the
flavor
which
was
toasty
and
robust
a
substantial
body
and
lingering
finish
make
for
an
excellent

experience
the

neither
does

buy

i
havent
had
that
privelige
yet
its
ok
as
far
as
coffee

porters
go
we
definitely
do
things
bigger
and
bolder
on

side
of
the

not
saying
thats
a
good
or
bad
thing
just
saying
our
coffee
beers
are
a
lot
more
in
your
face
with
coffee
flavors
pours
like
dark
water
smells
of
coffee
at
first
but
then
get
some
sort
of
smell
that
is
just
off
taste
is
not
pleasant
not
going
to
be
able
to
finish
my
portion
of

bottle
feel
is
what
you
would
expect
based
off
the
look
overall
not
good
rjt
this
is
a
highly
underrated
beer
in
my
opinion
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
brownish
red
hues
coming
through
the
glass
when
held
up
to
the
light
i
do
notpickup
a
lot
of
coffee
in
the
smell
more
of
the
roasted
malt
the
taste
however
is
where
i
was
blown
away
the
coffee
was
present
but
did
not
dominate
at
first
i
tasted
a
nice
burnt
caramel
that
blended
into
a
malty
seetness
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
i
noticed
a
nice
biscuitytoasty
flavor
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
will
pick
it
up
again
great
stuff
from
meantime
here
a
very
nice
coffee
porter
that
was
full
of
flavour
from
the
start
with
a
lots
of
coffee
present
throughout
you
wouldnt
really
expect
anything
else
though
given
the
name
the
beer
proved
an
easy
one
to
finish
with
a
nice
touch
of
bitterness
right
at
the
end
to
see
things
out
80100
its
finish
is
maltydry
and
approaching
mediumlight
at
times
aided
with
coffeetype
bitterness
slight
acrid
cocoa
and
the
broad
and
woodish
bitterness
from
hops
the
beer
concludes
with
a
long
earthen
and
toasted
linger
its
a
robust
taste
thats
likely
well
suited
for
chili
and
bittersweet
chocolate
o
good
beer
slightly
above
good
once
i
got
used
to
the
strength
of
the
coffee
the
beer
poured
black
with
a
cream
head
the
head
lingered
and
there
was
some
nice
lacing
on
my
glass
the
smell
and
the
flavor
were
weak
i
can
taste
coffee
i
can
taste
roasted
malt
all
the
flavors
i
expect
are
there
theyre
just
weaker
than
i
would
like
the
beer
goes
down
easily
overall
quite
good
more
chocolate
than
coffee
but
delicious
all
the
same
pours
a
very
deep
brown
with
reddish
highlights
that
is
close
to
black
a
good1finger
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
that
stays
around
for
a
bit
a
good
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
seen
also
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
some
black
coffeeespresso
the
taste
has
much
more
of
the
black
coffeeespresso
flavor
coming
through
for
the
finish
perfect
carbonation
for
this
type
of
brew
and
no
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
if
you
like
coffee
andor
stout
then
this
is
for
you
a
great
brew
o
very
well
made
surpised
i
have
not
had
before
not
usually
a
fan
of
this
style
but
maybe
the
higher
abv
removes
the
watery
aspect
sometimes
found
in
this
stlye
o
this
is
really
kind
of
a
misfire

are
certainly
worse

i
overall

drinking

porter
coffee
blends

not

but
a
little
boring
overall
this
beer
took
me
by
surprise
it
packs
a
punch
of
flavor
that
will
easily
attract
you
i
can
honestly
say
a
definite
must
grab
salud
overall
a
decent
english
porter
but
way
overpriced
for
what
it
is
i
wish
the
coffee
was
a
little
more
pronounced
pours
dark
brown
looking
a
bit
thin
as
it
comes
out
small
to
medium
light
beige
head
aroma
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
but
slightly
weak
flavor
is
coffee
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
a
bit
of
very
light
spice
on
the
finish
almost
tastes
like
chile
strange
aftertaste
for
a
porter
not
bad
but
something
a
little
strange
pours
a
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
tan
collar
aromas
of
blackstrap
molasses
and
plums
taste
begins
with
a
light
woody
flavor
followed
by
some
toffee
then
oatmeal
and
finishing
with
a
light
coffee
and
smoke
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
somewhat
disappointing
overall
a
good
porter
though
a
bit
pricy
for
what
you
get
imo
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
goes
great
with
brunch
it
tastes
like
a
coffee
soda
without
any
additional
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
it
goes
down
quite
smoothly
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
single
session
overall
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
especially
if
i
was
looking
for
a
coffee
flavor
i
dont
think
ive
ever
commented
on
bottle
shape
or
design
before
but
theres
something
about
the
meantime
series
that
i
really
like
the
half
bottle
shape
and
the
reserved
label
works
for
m
e
on
to
the
porter
one
thing
i
hate
is
when
beers
claim
to
have
some
flavor
like
a
coconut
porter
or
a
basil
honey
ipa
and
when
you
go
to
drink
it
the
flavor
is
either
hiding
or
unrecognizable
some
people
may
be
more
for
subtlety
but
screw
that
when
i
read

this

beer
its
got
lots
of

character
and
the

itself
seems
like
its

to
compliment
it
there
are
still
other
beers
that
really
ramp
up
the
java
and
balance
it
better
being
a
coffee
flavored

hmmm
id
have
been
happier
had
they
concentrated
less
on
the
coffee
and
more
on
the
porter
still
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
in
the
stout
department
it
seems
like
i
could
have
just
had
some
cold
coffee
with
a

of

i
would

it
again
just

this

would

one

its

midtier
and
i
initially
bought
it
just

it
looked

cool

was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
as
i
enjoyed
the
london
porter
and
im
missing
the
bitterness

coffee
beers
it
lacks

the
taste
is
a
sightly
sour
malt
with
coffiee
and
some
baking
coco
then
a
huge
rush
of
grassey
bitter
hops
without
the
coffee
flavouring
seems
like
it
would
be
a
formidable
beer
but
definitely
not
a
porter
overall
if
you
like
coffee
youll
love
this
this
is
definitely
a
coffee
porter
and
it
performs
just
like
it
advertises
would
make
a
great
desert
beer
the
appearance
is
a
little
lack
luster
and
the
aftertaste
can
become
overwhelming
after
a
while
but
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
what
it
is
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
though
d
great
beer
the
coffee
is
clean
and
delicious
d
glad
i
split
this
a
nice
after
dinner
treat

the
coffee
is
too
over

tastes
like

roasted

without
anything
more
cream
nuts
anything
expected
something
more
especially
for
the
price
tag
the
taste
is
rich
darkly

with
coffee
a

of
sweetsour
stewed
fruit
and
a
dryish
finish
with
faint
bitterness
characterised
by
dry
leaves
with
elements
of
coffee
and
chocolate
it
is
wonderfulyl
tasty
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
a
bit
more
unusual
than
i
expected
but
the
sourness
works
fine
for
me
i
like
it
wish
it
was
less
expensive
not
your
normal
porter
overall
a
well
drinkable
porter
very
appropriate
for
curling
up
in
front
of
a
fire
or
for
an
early
morning
drinker
probably
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
daily
basis
mainly
because
of
the
price
good

drinkability

thats
what
i
get
for

it

theres

with
a

burried

not

due

the
extreme
overall
bitterness
of
this

a
wakeup
and
smell
the
coffee
porter
it
is
this
wont
overpower
your
senses
but
if
you
like
porter
and
coffee
this
should
be
on
your
list
i
like
this
and
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
i
dont
know
that
id
reach
for
it
again
id
opt
for
a
baltic
porter
when
wanting
something
like
a
porter
and
would
rather
go
for
southern
tiers
jahva
or
founders
breakfast
stout
when
needing
that
certain
something
only
a
coffeeflavored
beer
can
deliver
md
very
well
bottleconditioned
showing
only
the
softest
carbonation
throughout
the
drink
and
the
body
remains
moderate
until
reaching
a
lightly
acidic
end
i
think
the
addition
of
coffee
beans
has
hugely
compromised
the
beer
base
that
presumably
is
meant
to
be
a
porter
as
the
sweet
edge
comes
a
bit
overpowering
and
the
coffee
aroma
too
seductive
for
the
more
traditional
read
understated
wineypruneish
sourness
of
a
porter
to
come
through
if
however
forgetting
about
the
name
altogether
this
is
a
successful
coffee
beer
that
comes
with
reasonable
complexity
a
good
body
of
coffeemalts
and
a
decent
depth
of
roastiness
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
end
to
satisfy
various
preferences
a
wellmade
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
a
very
deep
chestnut
to
brown
amber
with
quite
a
small
head
smell
is
wood
chips
and
coffee
well
more
like
coffee
grounds
quite
strong
sort
of
the
lighter
roast
with
a
bit
of
acidic
quality
to
it
acid
comes
out
in
the
taste
so
does
the
stale
tastes
quite
like
stale
decent
coffee
the
malt
is
very
weak
sort
of
disappointed
about
that
doesnt
seem
to
blend
well
on
the
palate
acidic
quality
seems
to
take
the
upper
hand
hints
of
woody
stored
quality
not
much
there
hint
of
smoke
not
much
compared
to
that
stale

meh
at
the

probably

finish

the

was

letdown
d

me
i
recommend
this
beer
to
any
discerning
porter
fan
if
you
want
an
alternative
to
guinness
and
esb
most
likely
seen
in
london
and
fancy
a
porter
than
give
this
a
try
of
note
i
dont
know
how
it
travels
as
i
picked
it
up
in
london
overall
a
decent
porter
not
the
fresh
coffee
aromas
and
flavors
i
was
hoping
for
though
d
were
it
not
for
the
4
29
pricetag
i
could
drink
this
all
day
true
porter
devotees
will
probably
slam
this
but
it
is
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
d
not
too
bad
but
the
citrus
sourness
might
hold
me
back
i
was
hoping
for
more
coffee
smoothness
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
smells
of
black
coffee
with
some
roastiness
in
the
background
i
usually
like
some
creaminess
in
the
smell
as
well
when
coffee
is
involved
but
this
works
the
taste
is
similar
with
more
black
coffee
flavors
and
roasted
grain
notes
but
this
time
there
is
a
touch
of
cream
at
the
end
there
is
also
a
hint
of
black
fruit
under
the
coffee
and
roast
its
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
like
and
surprisingly
light
but
quite
smooth
i
enjoyed
this
but
perhaps
not
quite
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
body
or
intensity
without
necessarily
raising
the
abv
this
was
a
very
interesting
experience
overall
i
didnt
really
like
this
beer
though
i
can
appreciate
what
its
trying
to
be
still
its
very
intense
largely
one
dimensional
devoid
of
standard
malt
character
and
more
sour
than
it
needs
to
be
the
coffee
is
all
over
the
aroma
and
smells
like
a
nice
medium
roast
nothing
too
dark
the
flavor
continues
with
more
big
coffee
with
a
slight
sweetness
like
a
touch
of
cream
and
sugar
was
added
in
the
background
i
can
tell
theres
beer
in
the
background
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
smooth
brown
ale
however
and
has
a
small
dash
of
grassy
hops
worth
a
try
if
you
dig
coffee
beers
d
very
drinkable
couldnt
have
more
than
two
probably
but
they
would
go
down
easy
i
agree
with
others
in
saying
this
is
the
best
coffee
beer
ive
ever
had
probably
the
best
coffee
beer
ive
had
dark
brown
and
clear
with
mahogany
highlights
an
inch
thick
cap
appeared
after
the
pour
but
this
receded
quickly
to
a
solid
collar
of
beige
bubbles
and
a
fine
skim
sitting
on
top
of
the
beer
plenty
of
bubbles
clung
to
the
glass
between
sips
leaving
a
smattering
of
lace
behind
the
aroma
coffee
nutty
and
roasty
with
a
hint
of
bittersweet
chocolate
there
just
wasnt
room
for
much
else
coffee
and
roast
were
prominent
in
the
flavour
but
caramel
sweetness
cut
through
from
start
to
finish
bitterness
was
moderate
and
lasted
through
the
end
and
the
coffee
flavour
rounded
out
the
finish
the
body
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
still
worked
carbonation
was
average
texture
a
little
dry
from
the
dark
grains
quite
a
good
coffee
porter
quite
drinkable
even
for
someone
who
doesnt
drink
coffee
d
i
should
have
taken
a
bottle
for
the
road
a
stunning
porter
from
meantime
mediumbodied
plenty
of
carbonation
that
fits
the
drink
well
and
nicely
drinkable
great
breakfast
beer
d
this
one
is
very
drinkable
i
could
see
this
beer
being
nice
at
a
late
breakfast
very
tasty
overall
drinkability
like
i
stated
before
its
not
the
most
complex
coffee
porter
out
there
but
at
least
its
decent
it
had
a
nice
level
of
roasted
espresso
beans
to
it
but
there
wasnt
much
after
that
a
little
bit
more
of
a
variety
is
what
this
beer
needs
alone
its
just
a
decent
espresso
beer
served
in
a
nonic
pourd
a
dark
brown
not
quite
opaque
as
there
was
some
light
penetration
that
revealed
ruby
red
highlights
half
inch
offwhite
head
quickly
settled
into
a
consistent
skim
of
foam
some
watery
sheets
of
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
scent
of
roasted
coffee
but
without
a
sweet
character
as
is
often
found
in
some
coffee
beers
coffee
flavor
is
also
pronounced
in
the
mouth
but
not
as
big
as
the
nose
followed
by
a
citrus
quality
with
a
spent
coffee
ground
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
light
and
effervescent
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
drinkability
is
average
it
went
down
easy
and
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
not
a
high
scorer
for
me
d
insanely
drinkable
i
havent
even
given
it
a
chance
to
warm
up
enough
yet
and
i
just
want
to
keep
drinking
it
its
just
so
good
well
balanced
and
sort
of
fruity
tangerine
comes
to
mind
in
the
aftertaste
after
so
many
times
of
passing
this
funny
looking
bottle
up
i
finally
grabbed
it
and
am
more
than
happy
that
i
did
drinkability
pretty
good
d
the
small
size
makes
it
rather
drinkable
would
be
good
morning
noon
or
night
i
would
buy
this
one
again
when
i
need
a
coffee
beer
fix
or
would
want
beer
with
breakfast
worth
it
to
check
out
may
not
be
the
best
out
there
but
it
offers
a
great
drinking
experience
decent
and
interesting
but
not
something
id
likely
seek
out
again
d
youd
better
like
coffe
tastes
more
like
a
cup
of
black
coffe
than
beer
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
desert
or
a
donut
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
a
nice
coffee
beer
initially
its
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
as
it
warms
it
becomes
a
little
too
acidic
easydrinking
bottle
notes
that
its
equivalent
to
a
cup
of
coffee
minus
the
caffeine
content
i
could
easily
drink
3
or
more
pints
balanced
roasty
malt
and
floral
hops
d
good
a
solid
coffee
porter
i
would
have
no
quarrel
with
savoring
this
fine
brew
another
time
the
taste
has
a
strong
coffee
presence
delicious
roasted
flavors
followed
by
a
soft
gentle
carbonation
a
bit
watery
with
a
nice
bitterness
to
back
up
the
roasted
coffee
nut
flavor
quality
porter
session
quality
more
please
i
got
this
meantime
coffee
porter
from
the
grapevine
in
pocatello
idaho
its
a
very
nice
brew
but
not
perfect
for
this
style
if
you
ask
me
it
was
a
bit
thin
and
light
in
color
lots
of
carbonation
but
the
smell
was
kickin
some
serious
coffee
with
hints
of
nut
and
chocolate
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
brew
but
did
hope
for
something
more
it
drinks
lighter
than
my
preferred
porters
like
flag
and
black
butte
frankly
it
drank
more
like
a
doppelbock
plus
the
bionic
coffee
i
just
cant
get
over
the
smells
from
this
nice
beer
its
sooo
very
nice
and
deep
the
pour
was
decent
but
not
much
head
to
it
it
poured
with
about
1
finger
which
died
off
within
a
few
minutes
and
didnt
leave
much
lace
at
all
this
beer
would
have
been
better
for
me
if
it
was
just
thicker
and
if
it
had
a
bit
richer
mouth
feel
to
it
it
drank
with
a
bit
more
alcohol
on
the
toungue
than
i
expected
from
a
6
porter
anyhow
a
very
good
drink
its
an
especially
good
one
that
you
can
sit
back
and
sniff
for
a
bit
nice
sipper
a
great
english
porter
try
some
as
for
drinkability
i
am
happy
to
report
it
is
only
6
because
i
could
easily
suck
down
several
of
these
in
no
time
flat
without
question
a
very
easily
consumed
beverage
i
will
definitely
try
to
keep
one
or
two
of
these
in
the
dbf
for
those
times
where
a
cup
of
coffee
just
wont
do
and
i
need
the
added
bonus
of
alcohol
d
drinkability
is
disgustingly
high
so
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
to
try
again
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
coffee
porter
i
like
the
little
info
it
says
on
the
back
label
each
serving
is
equal
to
one
cup
of
coffee
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
nicely
formed
almost
12
finger
off
white
head
headnaturally
the
coffee
aromas
hit
ya
along
with
some
woody
tones
and
unsweetened
chocolate
coffee
is
domanant
on
the
palate
but
is
not
the
only
thing
worth
mentioning
its
quite
arthy
with
some
noticeable
wooda
bit
of
sweetness
comesthru
but
to
me
its
unsweetened
dark
roast
coffee
that
dominates
a
very
nice
coffee
infused
porter
just
well
rounded
and
solid
a
very
tasty
example
of
the
style
but
not
a
truly
earthshattering
one
while
i
find
it
goes
down
very
easily
im
not
sure
it
warrants
6
for
an
11
2oz
bottle
if
someone
in
my
area
carried
it
for
less
and
enoteca
seems
just
about
the
most
expensive
beer
store
in
the
area
id
probably
buy
it
semiregularly
the
flavor
virtually
explodes
in
your
mouth
much
more
aggressive
and
vigorous
in
flavor
than
most
porters
the
coffee
is
more
than
noticeable
and
if
not
in
perfect
balance
with
the
dark
malts
it
asserts
itself
in
a
slightly
over
the
top
but
all
the
better
for
it
way
i
wouldnt
want
them
to
pull
back
at
all
this
is
definitely
one
that
ill
be
looking
for
in
the
future
especially
after
the
wifes
lustful
reaction
to
it
she
loved
it
a
word
quality
a
very
wellrounded
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
little
to
thin
for
my
tastes
very
soft
and
subtle
carbonation
that
i
do
enjoy
i
wont
be
reaching
for
this
again
soon
but
it
is
interesting
if
the
english
style
suits
your
taste
you
may
enjoy
this
more
than
i
have
d
wouldnt
want
2
in
a
row
but
it
is
a
very
nice
sipper
every
now
and
then
overall
well
i
cant
really
say
much
about
this
porter
its
fine
does
exactly
what
it
says
on
the
tin
it
didnt
blow
my
mind
or
disappoint
there
are
certainly
better
coffee
beers
out
there
this
one
was
a
little
too
unbalanced
and
one
dimensional
for
me
overall
an
average
stout
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
doubt
i
would
try
it
again
overall
this
was
a
very
solid
coffee
porter
not
the
best
but
i
have
had
some
good
ones
but
still
very
solid
and
a
classic
representation
of
the
style
there
is
no
doubt
i
would
try
this
one
again
anytime
it
was
very
good
the
coffee
in
this
beer
aint
subtle
it
pours
a
rubytinged
brown
with
a
lattecolored
head
okay
that
might
be
the
power
of
suggestion
aroma
is
mostly
coffee
same
for
the
fllavor
with
some
pleasantly
sour
vaguely
fruity
undertones
the
deeper
i
got
into
the
bottle
though
the
more
i
noticed
some
real
chocolate
presence
interesting
i
would
have
guessed
it
had
more
alcohol
not
bad
definitely
recommended
as
a
true
and
authentic
depiction
of
the
style
body
settles
to
a
jet
black
with
only
hints
of
ruby
and
brown
when
held
to
light
an
inch
and
a
half
of
rich
tan
head
and
has
nice
retention
it
does
leave
a
bit
of
lace
as
it
fades
nose
is
wonderfully
rich
with
huge
fresh
coffee
notes
toasty
malt
and
some
vanilla
dark
fruit
enters
the
mouth
massivelly
zesty
with
a
nice
richness
from
the
coffee
and
malt
backbone
quickly
balanced
by
a
hoppy
feel
and
minerals
intertwined
with
a
healthy
dose
of
spiceyness
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
shows
itself
on
the
back
half
of
the
palate
i
would
probably
call
this
a
baltic
porter
mouthfel
is
well
received
attractively
drinkable
coffee
based
brew
i
was
expecting
more
flavour
to
this
its
very
one
dimensional
i
expected
more
from
meantime
as
i
have
been
impressed
with
other
offerings
i
have
tried
mouthfeel
isnt
as
dry
as
a
roasty
beer
usually
would
be
and
leaves
some
stickiness
after
the
swallow
carbonation
is
a
little
high
but
this
beer
is
so
tasty
that
its
hard
to
stop
drinking
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
at
the
edges
a
decent
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
sparse
cap
the
smell
is
of
cold
sweetened
coffee
that
has
been
sitting
around
for
a
while
a
bit
chocolately
as
well
a
big
coffee
grounds
flavor
rust
and
some
dark
chocolate
not
a
very
robust
coffee
flavor
like
a
french
roast
but
definitely
a
strong
coffee
presence
the
feel
is
light
with
semi
soft
carbonation
the
brew
finishes
with
a
black
coffee
bitterness
an
interesting
brew
in
an
interesting
bottle
im
glad
the
feel
was
on
the
thin
side
as
it
makes
this
beer
more
drinkable
other
notes
this
beer
is
also
the
winner
of
multiple
awards
the
most
recent
coming
from
the
international
beer
challenge
october
2007
where
this
won
worlds
best
stout
porter
up
to
6
9
not
a
super
full
body
like
i
expected
actually
a
rather
refreshing
well
carbonated
beer
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
is
nothing
short
of
seriously
enjoyable
i
dont
remember
how
much
i
paid
for
this
but
im
glad
to
finally
try
a
meantime
beer
definitely
recommended
for
the
coffee
and
beer
lover
kind
of
makes
me
wish
it
was
morning
with
a
fresh
mug
of
sumatra
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
burgundy
hues
poking
through
when
held
to
light
great
frothy
tan
head
that
lingers
awhile
leaving
lacing
behind
in
its
wake
smells
of
coffee
of
course
sweet
malts
milk
chocolate
taste
is
also
of
sweet
coffee
like
an
extraextra
at
dunkin
donuts
this
stuff
is
dangerously
smooth
a
little
light
on
the
body
but
the
addictiveness
more
than
makes
up
for
it
so
damn
tasty
i
could
drink
these
all
evening
before
i
know
it
my
pint
is
empty
every
time
sweet
bottle
to
boot
drinkability
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
but
i
dont
think
i
could
do
it
all
night
this
beer
was
a
little
watered
down
for
my
tastes
but
it
didnt
take
away
from
it
being
enjoyable
try
it
out
if
you
if
you
see
one
but
dont
expect
a
world
class
porter
just
an
above
average
d
i
would
rate
this
much
more
drinkable
than
some
of
the
coffeebomb
imperial
stouts
i
have
sampled
but
personally
i
would
reserve
this
strictly
for
afterdinner
or
an
endofsession
sipper
it
goes
down
smooth
and
tasty
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
a
session
brew
d
a
really
good
beer
im
glad
i
finally
tried
it
any
coffee
drinker
would
dig
this
stuff
d
good

slightly
thin
and
quite
bitter
and
very
tasty
very
dark

with
good
clarity
aroma

strong

flavor
of

out
as

and
chocolate

but
i
remember
this
being
better
last
time
i
had
it
d
yes
very
drinkable
if
you
like

md
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
but
carbonation
doesnt
really
work
for
me
large
bubbles

this
is
a

an
exceptional

this
is
probably
the
purest
expression
of
coffee
that
i
have
ever
had
in
an
enlgish
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth

is

nice
thick

that
drifted
out
of
the
glass
before
i
even
got
my
nose
near
it
the
taste
is
absolutely
fabulous
wellbalanced
enough
of
a
coffee
taste
to
taste
rich
without
being
cartoonish
and
a
smooth
perhaps
a
bit
pricey
but
definitely
one
of
the
best
english
porters
on
the
market
nice
looking

same
for
the
beer
pours

but
pretty
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
hue
when
held
to
light

a

coffee

not
really
in
a
hijacking
way

tones
over
a
seriously
thick
malty

flavor
is
smokey
and
very
nicely
robust
super
smooth
on

very
drinkable
though
it
might
be
even
better
to
down
if
i
was
sitting
by
a

with
all
the
lights
in
the
room
off
very
drinkable

it
with

defiantly
do
it

aroma
with

on

there
is
a

acrid
minerality
to
the

as
well
there
is
some
nice
dry

is

and
gently
fades
leaving
a
nice

residual
coating
of

grinds
behind
overall
a
solid
good
british
style

porter
with
the
richness
and
dark
roasted
nature
you
would
come
to
expect
from
this
style
a
nice
coffee
grind
fade
leaves
a
gentle
reminder
of
the
full
roasted
heartiness
of
this
drink
leaving
you
wanting
more
to
wash
it
down
im
really
surprised
how
well
the
coffee
went
with
this
having
had
coffee
stouts
and
not
porters
i
thought
that
the
coffee
may
be
too
intense
for
a
porter
but
the
coffeee
character
in
this
one
is
very
balanced
as
someone
who
is
very
hit
or
miss
with
porters
i
feel
like
the
coffee
flavor
helped
to
make
up
for
many
of
the
shortcomings
i
usually
have
regarding
porters
notes
a
worthy
brew
reccomended

quickly
leaving

no

smells
strongly

overwhelmingly
with
coffee
playing
a
strong
role
too
chocolate
dominates
the

slight

are
noticeable
toward

unexpectedly
rich

with
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
this
one
drinkable
one
sip
definitely
invites
another
and
this
one
goes
quickly
phenomenal
a
very
solid
full
flavored
fullbodied
porter
with
no
noticeable
flaws
and
well
worth
the
price
d
a
nice
ale
w
coffee
focus
more
of
an
english
porter
w
a
more
subdued
malt
taste
one
was
enough
for
me
yet
has
a
great
aroma
definitely
worth
a
try
possibly
more
drinkability
if
less
effervessence
were
there
it
falt
like
some
of
the
malt
flavor
was
diverted
i
very
tasty
coffee
beer
overall
the
body
is
fairly
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
light
and
smooth
providing
a
fairly
thin
yet
creamy
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
like
the
freshest
cup
of
coffee
reminds
me
a
bit
of
peche
mortel
or
breakfast
stout
for
obvious
reasons
its
pretty
heavy
on
the
coffee
and
im
having
trouble
identifying
other
stuff
but
it
does
so
well
with
soreading
the
taste
that
im
in
love
with
it
light
body
amazing
after
taste
drinkability
is
excellent
i
found
sipping
this
while
watching
an
old
movie
to
be
a
pleasure
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass

sedately
with

taste
is
muted
lightly
bitter
dark
maltiness
with
not
nearly
as
much
coffee
character
as
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
on
the
prickly
carbonated
side
with
a
bit
above

sort
of
went
downhill
from
the
great
start
but
still
a
pretty
good
brew
overall
meantime
coffee
porter
pours
a
clear
red
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
with
some
caramel
and
an
earthy
smell
i
identify
with
coffee
but
im
not
sure
i
would
have
made
that
leap
if
it
was
not
on
the
bottle
i
also
smell
a
hint
of
ringwood
like
yeast
but
that
may
be
just
be
seeping
out
of
my
pores
the
flavor
is
dry
and
roasty
with
any
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
covered
by
an
astringent
coffee
flavor
the
coffee
is
more
prevelent
in
the
aftertaste
but
overall
im
not
sure
it
adds
too
much
to
the
beer
its
kind
of
a
stale
coffee
flavor
overall
a
very
nice
beer
but
not
one
i
would
want
often
much
less
2
in
one
night
d
notes
an
enjoyable
beer
tasted
very
fresh
despite
the
travel
distance
easily
drinkable
overall
very
well
done
ps
nice
looking
bottle
drinkability
simple
and
not
complex
just
good
old
fashioned
coffee
definitely
sessionable
especially
for
coffee
lovers
would
like
a
touch
more
sweetness
but
then
again
its
not
supposed
to
be
sweet
like
a
baltic
quality
at
any
rate
prosit
mk
i
like
the
premise
and
i
have
a
good
friend
that
raves
about
meantime
brews
ill
try
them
again
just
a
different
brew
ive
been
pleased
with
all
three
of
the
meantime
brewing
company
beers
that
ive
had
so
far
coffee
porter
is
a
nice
little
caffeinated
treat
that
will
please
your
palate
as
it
energizes
your
body
and
your
brain
not
only
that
but
the
bottle
is
a
keeper
i
dont
know
what
is
up
in
boise
but
there
are
way
more
cool
and
new
beers
available
than
years
past
i
know
most
are
imported
by
shelton
bros
but
i
hope
it
keeps
up
i
also
know
ericksons
fine
wine
in
eagle
has
this
fine
brew
available
ericksons
also
has
the
meantime
ipa
new
vintage
did
not
at
purchase
time
a
little
pricey
for
a
single
bottle
when
there
are
some
domestic
examples
that
are
just
as
good
regardless
if
youre
a
coffee
beer
fan
this
is
worth
a
try
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
english
porter
what
with
the
addition
of
actual
coffee
grinds
in
the
brewing
process
alcohol
is
not
a
factor
and
the
flavors
never
wavers
or
offends
as
this
beer
warms
another
solid
and
tasty
brew
from
meantime
d
not
even
close
to
an
abv
monster
but
still
enough
6
to
get
your
attention
from
an
11
2oz
bottle
this
seems
fitting
and
for
all
my
talk
about
how
strong
the
coffee
notes
are
in
the
bouquet
and
on
the
palate
this
is
really
a
treat
and
isnt
too
overthetop
but
definitely
makes
its
presence
known
if
youre
expecting
a
runofthemill
porter
with
a
faint
coffee
tinge
then
youd
be
disappointed
but
if
youre
looking
for
that
fresh
grounds
fix
this
is
your
porter
my
friend
overall
a
tasty
desert
beer
without
a
doubt
why
only
11
2
oz
i
would
like
this
in
a
22oz
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
i
liked
the
nice
mellow
coffee
character
allowing
it
to
accent
rather
than
dominate
really
get
one
thru
trade
or
put
on
your
wants

notch
drinker
poured
a
very
deep
brown
almost

that
shows
some
ruby
highlights
when
held

there
is
a
decent
sized
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
dark
malts
and
freshly
ground
coffee
the
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
dark
malts
and
coffee
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
this
is
certainly
a
very
enjoyable
brew
this
would
be
a
starter
drink
i
could
only
have
one
i
will
have
this
beer
again

a
very
tasty
beer
full
of
coffee
flavour
a
darn
decent
beer
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
this
at
a
beer
festival
and
i
am
glad
i
stumbled
across
this
booth
it
is
a
dark
pour
with
a
soft
minimal
head
definitely
in
my
book
a
dessert
beer
it
has
a
strong
coffee
flavor
and
is
a
little
sweet
with
a
light
british
carbonation
this
beer
dances
on
your
taste
buds
and
if
you
are
trying
to
talk
your
wife
into
beer
this
is
the
one
that
will
make
her
want
to
have
a
cold
one
with
you
one
of
my
top
10
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
im
glad
i
picked
up
this
bottle
the
price
was
decent
enough
and
id
never
heard
of
this
brewery
d
easy
to
enjoy
and
sip
on
would
be
good
with
desert
chocolate
etc
i
would
buy
this
again
it
is
one
of
the
better
coffee
porters
ive
had
pours
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
a
stiff
full
finger
light
tan
head
that
resists
fading
big
chunks
of

garner
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
beefy
semisweet
mocha
malt
medium
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
adequately
carbonated
full
flavored
the
taste
of
chocojava
is
present
without
a
heavy
roasted
character
so
it
finishes
cleaner
a
nice
drinker
overall
a
very
excellent
beer
that
is
well
done
especially
if
you
like
coffee
which
i
dont
for
the
most
part
but
still
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
order
it
in
a
heartbeat
coffee
lovers
should
really
love
the
beer
was
dark
burgandy
brown
colored
just
barely
clear
thin
whitish
head
the
aroma
was
coffee
and
malty
beer
i
would
have
sworn
it
was
breakfast
stout
except
the
appearance
wasnt
as
nice
the
taste
was
mostly
coffee
with
some
sweet
malt
and
the
beer
had
enough
physical
presence
that
i
suspected
it
had
lots
more
malt
in
the
bill
than
the
6
alcohol
content
reveals
it
to
have
very
nice
too
bad
its
not
so
easily
available
d
black
coffee
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
so
one
of
these
is
good
for
me
but
is
a
fine
example
of
a
coffee
beer
maybe
i
could
have
two
of
these
drinkability
tastes
far
better
than
it
smells
also
the
bottle
sure
is
a
beaut
getting
only
330ml
never
looked
so
good
d
the
coffee
is
big
and
stale
and
the
malt
taste
reminds
me
of
a
weak
american
bock
the
flavor
is
not
that
impressive
but
the
head
last
and
last
im
not
sure
i
want
to
commit
to
the
big
bottles
of
meantime
but
im
glad
they
only
sell
this
in
a
small
bottle
that
is
enough
drinks
too
easy
this
is
my
kind
of
coffee
porterstout

falling

down
the

the
aroma
is
intensely
aromatic
coffees
ground
roasted
almost
charred
black
patent
malts
have
to
be
in
there
a
tad
nutty
the
taste
is
even
more
dominated
by
the
bean
almost
a
mean
streak
a
bite
accompanying
a
rise
in
carbonation
through
the
middle
then
settling
into
softer
coffee
and
nutty
tones
and
the
tongue
is
left
prickling
from
the
carbonation
the
body
is
relatively
full
particularly
after
warming
overall
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
my
cup
of
erm
tea
but
itll
do
a
decent
coffee

nicely

this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
hues
around
the
edges
the
head
is
monsterous
especailly
for
a
coffee
beer
it
is
two
inches
high
creamy
fluffy
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
coffee
grounds
nuts
sweet
milk
chocolate
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
cream
the
taste
has
quite
a
bit
more
coffee
to
it
than
the
aroma
chocolate
and
cream
rounds
out
the
coffee
flavors
in
the
sip
while
the
finish
in
pleasantly
nutty
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
fine
lively
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
does
not
have
as
much
coffee
in
it
as
most
american
coffee
beers
however
adding
more
coffee
to
this
beer
would
probably
mask
too
many
of
its
other
flavors
and
aromas
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
shame
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
would
drink
it
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
with
a
punchyouinthemouth
coffee
taste
to
it
however
if
in
the
mood
for
a
well
design
not
over
the
top
porter
this
would
certainly
do
the
trick
lighter
then
what
i
expected
but
it
still
has
great
body
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
roasted
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
patent
and
roasted
malts
its
slightly
bitter
and
quite
earthy
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
bold
coffee
taste
up
front
but
it
mellows
out
in
the
finish
it
has
a
light
chocolate
sweetness
that
rounds
out
the
flavor
its
still
dry
and
earthy
but
not
over
the
top
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
porter
the
coffee
blends
in
well
and
adds
a
bunch
of
character
to
the
taste
a
good
drinker
definitely
a
big
winner
from
meantime
i
wish
i
could
remember
what
i
paid
for
this
bottle
but
i
fear
it
was
too
much
to
make
it
a
regular
drinker
but
in
the
meantime
so
to
speak
ill
enjoy
this
one
a
great
beer
i
bought
his
due
to
the
fact
that
i
enjoyed
their
ipa
this
was
in
an
odd
11
2
oz
bottle
that
was
shaped
more
like
the
750ml
their
other
beers
are
available
in
the
label
notes
that
one
serving
is
equal
to
one
cup
of
coffee
so
this
should
be
interesting
the
color
was
brown
but
light
enough
to
see
through
if
held
to
a
light
the
head
is
short
and
light
tan
in
color
the
smell
is
like
ground
coffee
beans
and
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
like
maple
syrup
and
a
little
milkylactose
but
oddly
not
much
coffee
flavor
just
a
hint
of
coffee
bitterness
in
the
background
the
more
this
warms
up
the
more
the
coffee
takes
over
this
one
was
just
average
to
me
if
porters
or
coffee
beers
are
your
thing
then
by
all
means
try
this
one
if
you
dont
usually
seek
out
porters
specifically
you
can
skip
this
one
11
2
oz
bottle
my
glass
is
filled
with
deep
brown
liquid
with
a
finger
of
ivory
to
light
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
full
coat
atop
the
beer
there
is
very
little
carbonation
after
the
initial
pour
and
clarity
is
excellent
the
nose
on
this
one
screams
coffee
to
me
lots
of
icedcoffee
tones
with
a
solid
roasted
backbone
behind
it
the
coffee
dominates
and
obscures
any
other
aromas
that
might
be
in
there
the
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
the
initial
flavor
hits
coffee
very
full
coffee
this
fades
after
a
long
stay
on
my
tongue
to
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
notes
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
brings
coffee
back
to
mind
the
flavors
are
good
there
is
definitely
a
dominant
coffee
but
the
base
beer
comes
through
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
for
the
flavor
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
little
skewed
to
the
coffee
but
that
means
truth
in
advertising
i
would
gladly
have
it
again
as
the
slant
in
one
direction
doesnt
bug
me
too
much
as
i
love
some
nice
robust
coffee
recommended
if
you
like
coffee
i
highly
recommend
you
try
this
and
this
brew
from
meantime
comes
in
a
cool
looking
330ml
bottle
so
you
dont
even
have
to
commit
to
their
standard
750ml
size
final
comments
i
have
to
agree
with
the
first
reviewer
and
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
coffee
infused
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
was
very
well
put
together
with
all
of
the
ingredients
working
in
harmony
to
deliver
a
wonderful
product
well
done
meantime
this
beer
is
dialed
in
a
wonderful
its
one
of
the
best
coffeeinfused
beers
ive
had
for
the
past
couple
of
years
the
only
things
we
got
from
meantime
out
here
on
the
west
coast
were
750s
of
ipa
and
porter
ive
had
those
and
been
impressed
so
i
went
for
the
coffee
porter
as
soon
as
i
found
it
besides
they
have
cool
labels
with
a
victorian
mechanical
feel
überhip
im
not
usually
terribly
thrilled
with
odd
ingredients
in
beer
beyond
the
traditional
four
but
the
porterstout
range
of
the
style
spectrum
is
fairly
easily
doctored
to
drinkable
effect
there
have
been
others
out
there
to
use
coffee
in
the
dark
ale
speedway
stout
from
alesmith
leaps
to
mind
excellent
stuff
some
more
successful
than
others
meantimes
coffee
beer
is
pretty
wellpaired
with
the
coffee
but
i
find
i
prefer
a
more
substantial
body
with
richer
malt
character
to
offset
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
on
the
other
hand
comparing
this
to
speedway
for
drinkability
i
could
go
through
a
few
of
these
and
still
function
consumption
of
an
equivalent
quantity
of
speedway
may
provide
you
with
sufficient
caffeine
alertness
for
you
to
put
your
arms
up
before
your
face
hits
the
floor
in
the
meantime
im
going
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
more
meantime
products
as
they
filter
out
to
this
coast
d
if
you
can
drink
several
cups
of
coffee
you
can
drink
several
bottles
of
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
has
its
fair
share
of
interesting
interrelationships
all
in
all
this
is
probably
best
on
a
weekend
morning
seems
like
a
good
way
to
wake
up
and
drink
at
the
same
time
in
preparation
for
more
beers
to
come
hooray
for
the
mix
of
stimulants
and
depressants
pretty
much
its
a
light
bodied
lowalcohol
beer
thats
good
if
you
really
like
coffee
i
enjoyed
it
served
chilled
in
a
chalice
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
im
not
a
big
coffee
fan
but
this
beer
was
good
cheers
d
if
you
like
coffee
dont
touch
it
if
you
dont
of
the
five
here
that
tried
it
i
appear
to
like
it
the
least
so
you
may
like
it
more
but
to
me
its
like
fake
starbucks
watereddown
cold
coffee
not
great
recommend
especially
for
the
java
lover
thanks
to
khiasmus
for
the
bottle
had
to
try
it
though
since
im
a
sucker
for
the
style
i
am
a
big
fan
of
meantime
their
ipa
is
one
of
my
regulars
when
i
can
get
it
and
this
is
an
interesting
side
note
glad
i
tried
it
try
it
again
maybe
not
sure
this
has
quite
a
light
body
to
it
with
just
a
touch
of
fullness
as
it
rests
on
the
palate
the
beer
starts
out
dry
and
roasty
but
quickly
picks
up
a
soft
sweetness
that
really
helps
with
the
overall
perceived
balance
the
beer
finishes
with
a
chalklike
cocoa
powder
note
some
roastderived
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
burnt
acidity
there
was
a
solid
amount
of
coffee
used
in
this
brew
i
wonder
how
much
if
any
dark
malts
were
used
in
this
brew
because
i
could
totally
see
this
as
getting
all
of
its
dark
color
and
character
from
coffee
i
suppose
though
that
the
chocolate
aromatics
and
flavor
are
probably
derived
from
roasted
malt
quite
a
tasty
brew
and
with
the
caffeine
punch
it
is
a
good
way
to
start
off
an
evening
of
drinking
i
had
this
one
in
a
small
bottle
i
poured
it
in
a
snifter
the
color
was
dark
brown
with
nice
reddish
hues
when
put
in
the
light
the
nose
was
all
about
the
name
coffee
ground
coffee
beans
true
to
its
name
on
the
palate
same
flavors
of
coffee
throughout
the
whole
drinking
experience
backed
by
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
body
was
low
in
carbonation
nicely
done
the
carbonation
is
pretty
strong
with
lots
of
small
almost
sharp
bubbles
meantime
coffee
really
smells
like
coffee
with
some
sweet
aromas
in
the
background
the
bottle
looks
like
a
mini
champagne
the
beer
is
black
like
a
murky
guiness
and
doesnt
pour
with
much
foam
luckily
it
doesnt
taste
as
much
coffee
as
the
smell
leads
you
to
expect
although
it
creeps
up
on
your
palate
in
the
aftertaste
reading
about
this
beer
you
may
think
its
a
broiler
freak
but
it
is
actually
an
excellent
brew
light
roast
and
dark
cocoa
malt
in
aroma
nice
chocolatey
flavor
nutty
malt
backbone
with
a
lightly
bitter
finish
great
example
of
the
style
albeit
a
touch
sweet
overall
i
think
my
bottle
might
be
a
little
out
of
date
unless
the
sour
milkoyster
type
flavour
in
intentional
a
decent
beer
but
the
750ml
format
is
not
ideal
for
me
worth
a
try
the
tasting
notes
on
this
one
are
spot
on
it
definitely
has
the
big
malty
flavor
and
the
bit
of
astringency
on
the
finish
its
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
which
can
just
barely
be
seen
through
when
light
is
shown
through
overall
im
a
porter
fan
and
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
it
has
good
complexity
where
it
needs
it
but
remains
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
in
the
style
porter
great
london
beer
style
of
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
none
the
less
a
very
good
porter
and
a
must
try
for
porter
fans
definitely
has
a
strong
malt
profile
which
gives
quite
a
character
to
this
porter
its
not
the
best
but
its
not
too
miss
either

taste
follows
suit
with
lots
of
roast

chocolate
along
with
hints
of
tobacco
toffee
subtle
smoke
cocoa
and
black
cherries
unfortunately
the
metallic
aftertaste
totally
takes
away
from
all
the
pleasant
aspects
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
disappointingly
thin
and
lacking
any
body
the
finish
is
bitter
and
metallic
overall
this
beer
started
off
promising
but
the
metallic
aftertaste
dominated
the
experience
ill
stick
to
the

chocolate

poured

an
elysian
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
in
the
glass
with
thin
light
brown

that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
thick
ring
around
the

hops
and
toasted

medium
bodied
flavors
are
slightly
subdued
but
very
nicely
melded
and
complex
a
classic
english
style
porter
the
aftertaste
lingers
for
quite
a
while
and
invites
another
taste
o
this
is
a
seriously
old
school
take
on
an
historic
ale
style
but
it
may
be
a
bit
intense
for
fans
of
contemporary
porters
very
turbulent
and
challenging
somehow
not
as
satisfying
as
i
expected
it
would
be
but
still
pretty
good
o
this
is
an
incredible
brew
balanced
yet
strong
notes
with
a
wonderful
downthehatch
feel
porters
often
attempt
to
be
this
good
but
so
few
really
are
i
have
tasted
porters
often
and
would
like
to
like
them
but
seldom
do
this
porter
however
is
one
of
the
absolute
best
ive
ever
tasted
hands
down
had
it
fairly
recently
for
the
first
time
at
the
meantime
pub
brewery
in
greenwich
london
uk
on
draft
and
i
was
totally
blown
away
more
recently
found
a
750
ml
bottle
at
a
local
favorite
supplier
in
durham
nc
today
i
cracked
the
cork
and
noted
a
little
bit
of
a
pop
but
not
much
aroma
was
outstanding
and
definitely
reminded
me
of
my
original
draft
tasting
at
the
brewery
i
poured
it
into
my
meantime
pint
glass
from
the
original
tasting
it
was
wonderful
on
a
full
steady
pour
color
was
dark
brown
chocolate
with
lighter
brown
1
head
foam
was
very
tasty
and
subsided
over
a
reasonable
time
overall
taste
and
experience
in
drinking
this
porter
as
a
draft
and
bottled
product
is
awesome
when
the
mood
strikes
for
a
porter
im
looking
for
this
fine
offering
from
meantime
on
draft
in
london
or
in
the
750
ml
bottle
here
in
the
usa
happy
to
finally
have
a
go
to
porter
tastecoffee
and
cream
carameltoffee
faint
charred
bitterness
in
the
finish
nice
depth
of
flavor
and
character
a
classic
english
porter
and
a
fine
match
for
a
steak
or
burger
worth
a
try
for
sure
what
one
would
expect
from
and
english
porter
i
picked
this
up
for
7
and
i
have
a
feeling
it
was
priced
wrong
by
just
looking
at
the
big
corked
bottle
o
this
is
a
proper
porter
malty
and
rich
but
light
and
very
drinkable
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewer
as
i
just
saw
them
on
calgary
shelves
the
medium
body
is
perfectly
sized
to
the
style
my
main
issue
is
that
the
carbonation
is
really
lively
its
not
spritzy
or
bigbubbled
by
any
means
but
its
really
foamy
otherwise
its
a
lesson
in
how
to
make
a
porter
just
as
robust
as
it
needs
to
be
without
being
too
strong
skip
this
and
have
the
coffee
version
instead
overall
not
bad
but
not
interesting
the
definition
of
average
while
not
the
chocolate
overdose
of
some
new
world
offerings
that
is
the
whole
point
this
traditional
incarnation
displays
the
sour
milk
and
old
castle
trappings
of
smoke
coffee
and
leather
doing
so
with
a
traipsing

dry

and
some

notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
floral
coffee
notes
and
some
subtle
black
chocolate
notes
with
some
dry
roasted

notes
also
playing
a
major
role
light
residual
sugar
can
also
be
detected
with
no
astringency
and
good

overall
body
is
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
solid
rendition
of
the
style
with
good
balance
overall
i
strongly
recommend
against
pairing
this
with
italian
of
any
sort
anything
that
is
sweet
or
overly
acidic
contains
tomato
or
citrus
is
a
lighttasting
food
or
seafood
it
may
possibly
be
paired
with
raw
oysters
mussels
and
clams
at
your
own
risk
for
symphony
and
synergy
in
taste
but
it
is
not
a
pairing
that
screams
at
me
as
do
the
pairings
with
spicy
meat
dishes
and
carbonized
steaks
original
porter
with
its
own
character
excellent
beer
and
definitely
far
from
boring
i
drank
the
whole
750ml
and
it
was
pure
pleasure
until
the
last
drop
drinkabilityoverall
a
fairly
complex
beer
that
i
enjoyed
somewhat
onesided
though
overall
i
graded
this
as
an
english
porter
so
although
thats
not
my
favorite
branch
of
stoutporter
this
one
is
awesome
at
nailing
that
style
if
you
like
english
porters
with
their
bitteralmost
sourness
and
very
roast
malts
id
say
grab
this
one
for
sure
o
a
tasty
porter
that
offers
up
a
tasty
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
solid

and
easy
drinking
its
rich

it
the
flavour
slightly
less
so
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a

more
viscous
a
tasty
brew
that
goes
down
nicely
but
could
perhaps
have
a
more

d
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
its
a
little
pricey
but
im
glad
i
bought
a
bottle
overall
its
great
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
o
not
a
bad
porter
but
oddly
subtle
and
very
thin
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
feels
and
tastes
more
like
a

than
a

certainly
drinkable
at
least
d

the
pleasant
flavor
combined
with
the
lightness

make
it

one
would
possibly
want
something
with
a
deeper

overall
drinkability
a
very
nice

overall
the
beer
is
quite

very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
another
750ml
to
split
with
the
mrs
and
went
fantastic
with
a
cottage
pie
for
dinner
definitely
better
when
warmed
up
but
still
pretty
good
when
cold
and
first
poured
my
only
comment
which
makes
me
wonder
about
this
beer
is
that
on
the
label
it
says
bottle
conditioned
but
there
is
no
sediment
at
all
in
this
beer
and
the
beer
is
too
clear
when
held
up
to
the
light
so
where
did
the
bottle
conditioning
yeast
go
or
do
they
mean
something
else
by
bottle
conditioned
here
regardless
of
this
minor
mystery
a
very
good
porter
and
something
i
could
easily
pick
up
again
despite
the
price
i
must
find
a
way
to
have
it
directly
from
a
cask
should
i
ever
get
the
chance
a
pleasure
to
try

good
overall
mouth
feel
is
rather
watery
despite
the
generous
carbonation
a
little
dryingwarming
alcohol
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
with
a
thin
carbonation
and
a
body
that
is
approaching
full
not
a
bad
beverage
at
all
i
wish
the
malt
flavor
lasted
longer
but
its
still
a
tasty
brew
well
worth
checking
out
pours
a
cola
brown
with
a
light
brown
creamy
head
with
2
fingers
worth
lace
is
fantastic
aroma
is
very
roasted
with
a
dry
cocoa
note
a
nuttiness
and
slight
caramel
notes
taste
is
more
chocolaty
light
sweetness
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
candied
sugar
body
is
very
creamy
medium
at
best
feels
good
and
goes
down
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
solid
daily
drinker
wish
it
came
in
a
smaller
cheaper
bottle
though
i
had
this
beer
at
nerax
cask
fest
in
boston
in
the
spring
11
and
had
to
search
it
out
its
a
very
tasty
beer
thats
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
dry
elegant
brew
good
with
cheese
ham
etc
im
usually
a
big
fan
of
meantimes
different
brews
this
one
however
is
definitely
not
their
best
effort
honestly
this
is
an
extremely
average
porter
however
it
is
not
bad
when
poured
i
noticed
the
light
amber
brown
color
the
minimal
froth
and
lace
the
aroma
was
typical
of
a
porter
and
was
not
impressive
nor
was
the
taste
a
typical
run
of
the
mill
porter
o
very
good
quality
beer
really
easy
to
drink
o
very
easy
to
drink
very
nice
porter
will
definitely
seek
out
another
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
its
lighter
in
body
but
still
quite
flavorful
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
great
beer
good
friends
who
could
ask
for
more
o
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
porter
with
a
complimentary
bitterness
and
balanced
smooth
taste
profile
definitely
drinkable
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
overall
nice
very
classic
traditional
porter
light
bodied
too
much
carbonation
not
impressed
with
this
beer
poured
deep
deep
redmahogany
with
a
nice
twofinger
offwhite
head
that
retained
well
and
left
very
nice
lace
strong
roasted
coffee
aromas
with
plenty
of
semisweet
chocolate
to
back
it
up
toss
in
some
dark
cherries
raisins
and
toast
to
create
a
complex
wellbalanced
profile
flavors
follow
with
the
coffee
taking
enter
stage
the
chocolate
more
subdued
and
the
dark
fruit
coming
forward
medium
body
more
carbonation
than
expected
and
a
smooth
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
not
sure
when
a
porter
becomes
a
stout
but
this
has
to
be
close
very
delicious
almost
like
sitting
in
a
cafe
sipping
on
a
cup
of
coffee
considering
the
taste
the
smell
alone
lets
the
drinker
know
its
going
to
be
tasty
and
its
well
balanced
where
its
not
bitter
nor
tasteless
but
medium
bodied
with
a
load
of
tastes
very
recommended
overall
damn
good
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
that
is
very
well
done
ive
had
this
one
aging
for
over
a
year
and
its
kept
very
well
definitely
worthy
of
its
rating
this
is
an
absolutely
cracking
beer
i
only
gave
it
3
days
to
settle
and
i
think
it
would
age
fabulously
wel
worth
a
try
and
its
given
me
the
taste
for
porters
again
after
spending
3
weeks
in
san
fran
where
all
the
porters
are
onedimensional
coffeepacked
waterthin
rubbish
drinkability
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
was
just
surprised
by
the
level
of
chocolate
overall
the
flavors
and
the
aromas
were
complex
and
well
balanced
this
was
a
great
pick
from
the
local
store
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
would
buy
it
again
what
is
different
about
this
porter
is
that
it
has
a
light
body
for
a
porter
and
in
no
way
does
this
negatively
affect
the
beer
great
offering
here
from
meantime
bottle
cracked
this
one
open
to
a
very
surprising
gushing
of
tan
foam
shooting
out
of
the
bottle
truly
was
not
expecting
that
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
murky
reddish
tinged
brown
color
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
that
leaves
lace
as
it
settles
dark
fruit
roast
coffee
sherry
and
slight
leather
in
the
nose
medlight
mouthfeel
that
due
to
the
carbonation
leans
toward
the
light
side
for
me
light
roast
coffee
flavors
gives
way
to
some
dark
fruit
sweetness
and
then
ends
with
a
slight
bitterness
some
alcohol
faintly
noticeable
in
the
taste
overall
im
a
little
hohum
on
this
one
the
over
carb
and
light
body
arent
doing
any
favors
for
it
and
the
flavors
are
pretty
subtle
extremely
drinkable
and
if
martyn
cornells
studies
on
porter
are
correct
mostly
true
to
that
being
brewed
during
the
middle
of
the
18th
century
in
london
rather
complex
yet
marvelously
easygoing
the
6
5
abv
doesnt
really
show
itself
unless
drinking
it
in
quantity
over
a
brief
period
the
price
point
this
particular
bottle
came
in
at
7
99
is
a
bit
high
but
the
experience
is
worth
it
d
quite
drinkable
warming
filling
and
satisfying
this
porter
is
recommended
the
bottle
is
lovely
as
well
a
thick
heavy
champagne
bottle
with
the
meantime
clock
emblem
on
the
neck
brewed
for
flavour
brewed
with
style
and
a
welldesigned
label
im
impressed
body
was
kind
of
thin
but
the
carbonation
made
it
kind
of
creamy
which
made
up
for
it
a
little
bit
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
not
as
cleanly
or
strongly
flavorful
as
i
would
have
liked
still
a
solid
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
d
this
is
definitely
uinque
compared
to
the
english
porters
ive
had
thus
far
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
made
great
by
its
subtleties
and
nuances
and
features
one
of
the
best
chocolate
flavors
ive
yet
experienced
the
flavor
is
really
quite
bland
really
mild
with
a
touch
of
diacetyl
really
faint
chocolate
is
there
as
well
other
than
that
some
roasted
malt
and
thats
about
it
body
is
quite
light
and
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
drinkability
is
okay
but
overall
there
isnt
anythin
really
impressive
about
this
brew
chewy
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
up
front
along
with
a
nice
roasty
malt
flavor
theres
a
slight
lactic
cream
presence
that
compliments
the
chocolate
malts
as
well
as
hints
of
caramel
hazelnut
oatmeal
and
toffee
slightly
smokey
with
a
dry
finish
the
taste
is
spot
on
its
a
creamy
fairly
full
bodied
affair
with
lots
of
heavy
fruits
chocolate
cherry
and
oakiness
some
roasted
notes
some
sweeter
malts
in
there
too
the
taste
is
very
complex
there
are
the
darker
malts
balanced
nicely
against
the
cherry
chocolate
the
oakiness
the
dark
berry
flavors
this
is
really
good
there
is
a
touch
of
old
english
butterscotch
in
there
too
really
complex
stuff
with
each
sip
a
slightly
different
experience
just
the
way
it
ought
to
be
this
is
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
md
very
effervescent
smooth
velvety
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
not
get
bored
expensive
but
worth
the
the
best
english
porter
ive
tasted
yet
at
the
time
of
this
review
this
beer
was
10
on
the
top
english
porter
list
the
taste
confirms
the
roasted
maltiness
and
a
nice
balance
with
a
unexpected
smokiness
i
am
surprised
how
light
bodied
the
beer
is
i
did
not
expect
this
from
a
porter
a
little
overpowering
sweetness
but
a
nice
and
very
drinkable
beer
i
do
like
the
cork
system
with
the
nice
red
label
around
the
neck
dnot
bad
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
one
not
sure
on
how
old
it
is
either
as
there
isnt
any
clear
dating
on
this
bottle
d
all
750ml
goes
almost
too
easily
very
drinkable
a
very
big
beer
for
the
style
blind
tasting
i
probably
would
have
put
this
in
an
american
porter
style
or
perhaps
even
a
stout
loads
of
roasted
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
smokey
but
not
peat
aspect
vying
against
one
another
for
attention
perhaps
a
tad
thin
at
the
end
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
porter
its
definitely
from
across
the
pond
and
delivers
a
great
roasted
malt
character
with
very
restrained
hops
and
the
fruity
esters
present
the
carbonation
seems
a
bit
high
to
style
but
it
is
bottle
conditioned
and
may
have
sat
for
a
while
this
is
somewhat
remarkable
because
i
dont
really
get
much
in
the
way
of
oxidation
d
great
all
around
porter
really
quite
good
indeed
nutty
and
roasty
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
fruitiness
ranges
from
dark
to
medium
with
even
a
bit
of
strawberry
tartness
chalky
minerals
round
things
out
and
showcase
what
an
english
porter
is
all
about
full
bodied
and
displays
an
elusive
creaminess
that
is
very
much
appreciated
one
of
the
more
expensive
english
porters
out
there
i
paid
12
for
a
750
but
certainly
worth
the
splurge
every
now
and
again
delicious
beer
and
a
prime
example
of
the
style
done
right
d
a
great
example
of
a
porter
just
the
wateriness
that
draws
back
from
it
color
brownish
red
good
lacing
it
has
aroma
and
flavor
of
chocolate
heavy
coffee
heavy
and
caramel
light
beer
and
tasty
nice
drinkability
medium
bodied
and
with
alcohol
in
the
right
measure
could
be
a
more
potent
beer
but
it
is
very
good
pretty
carbonated
a
bit
overly
so
with
a
clean
finish
might
be
a
little
light
bodied
but
good
overall
there
are
better
examples
out
there
overall
this
kinda
sucked
would
never
buy
another
product
from
this
brewery
because
this
was
a
totally
avoidable
mistake
the
beer
isnt
infected
its
just
carbed
like
pop
rocks
like
old
faithful
like
alka
seltzer
decent
potential
ruined
by
sloppy
carb
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
with
some
earthy
hops
and
some
astringency
the
flavor
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
some
nuttyness
i
also
get
some
earthy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
na
zdravje
drinkability
a
nice
evening
sipper
i
enjoyed
i
really
liked
the
nose
and
flavor
of
this
beer
but
the
carbonation
was
just
over
the
top
and
ruined
it
for
me
very
complex
the
initial
taste
revealed
sweet
flavors
of
pastry
cream
and
chocolate
then
sweetened
dark
coffee
followed
by
a
meaty
quality
like
beef
jerkey
or
a
smoked
leg
of
something
dry
roasted
flavors
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
lots
of
chocolate
toward
the
finish
but
not
sugary
at
all
good
co2
sends
the
flavors
along
very
well
received
d
i
love
englishlondon
porters
and
this
one
is
no
different
with
a
more
robust
mouthfeel
this
one
could
rival
fullers
since
the
taste
is
there
a
must
buy
i
dont
know
why
i
waited
so
long
overall
excellent
balance
of
drinkability
and
style
notes
interesting
beer
apparently
this
is
more
like
a
traditional
porter
much
more
earthy
flavors
and
tart
and
dark
fruit
as
well
with
less
of
the
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
the
flavor
was
a
little
thin
but
there
was
a
diversity
of
flavors
interesting
beer
that
was
pretty
tasty
but
nothing
really
special
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
for
a
good
price
drinkability
heavy
and
a
touch
dry
not
something
to
drink
willynilly
something
to
savor
yet
easy
enough
for
a
session
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
little
stronger
than
many
porters
so
ill
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
i
wont
drink
them
all
night
aroma
is
quite
strong
smoky
and
coffeeish
with
a
firm
overtone
of
unsweetened
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
it
pours
a
dark
warm
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
and
persistent
light
tan
head
flavor
is
smoky
with
good
tones
of
fine
roast
coffee
and
unsweetened
chocolate
along
with
hints
of
molasses
and
a
touch
of
spice
texture
is
smooth
a
bit
thick
and
somewhat
fizzy
english
porters
are
not
normally
my
cup
of
beer
but
meantime
makes
a
mean
london
porter
thank
you
very
much
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
think
it
might
get

a
nice
foamy

with
some
lighter

some

smells
of
coffee
roasted

and
what
the
hell

bark
taste
is
definitely
coffee
roasted
malts
you
know
the
smell
of
the
tip
of
a
stick
after
youve
roasted
a
dozen
or
so
marshmallows
on
it
toasty
sweet
that
taste
is
in
there
too
mouthfeel
is
good
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
to
it
though
very
drinkable
delicious
beer
750
ml
caged
and
corked

served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
is
good
lacing
is
decent
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
it
smells
like
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malt
nuts
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
smoked
and
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
a
bit
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
starts
off
sweet
then
has
a
bitter
and
dry
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
coating
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
if
i
had
another
bottle
of
it
id
drink
it
now
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
ill
definitely
be
buying
this
again
overall
not
bad
i
would
really
like
to
try
the
coffee
porter
as
im
a
huge
sucker
for
coffee
beers
this
beer
along
with
the
meantime
ipa
are
two
of
the
best
british
ales
to
ever
hit
my
tastebuds
kudos
to
them
f
finishes
pretty
sweet
still
with
lingering
brown
sugar
and
smoked
malts
some
light
bitterness
comes
through
well
but
still
battles
that
sweet
malty
flavor
a
lingering
earthy
bitter
flavor
adds
a
nice
finish
but
an
almost
metallic
flavor
takes
that
addition
away
the
smoked
malt
addition
is
very
nice
pour
of
coca
cola
ruby
in
the
light
and
a
somewhat
large
head
of
very
light
brown
nose
light
of
chocolate
and
coffee
equally
matched
with
maltose
and
a
nice
apple
fruit
a
bit
bready
palate
is
a
bit
toasty
and
a
much
harsher
carbonation
than
expected
delutes
the
palate
marginalizes
all
the
wonderful
stuff
that
in
the
nose
probably
wonderful
after
two
years
of
storage
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
leaving
a
bit
of
coatiung
which
deducts
from
its
drinkability
a
very
very
nice
example
of
the
style
it
attempts
to
provide
the
drinker
with
a
feel
for
the
older
original
british
porters
using
this
beer
its
not
hard
to
see
why
this
style
can
be
wellrounded
if
done
right
excellent
d
kip
says
thats
pretty
smooth
i
can
keep
drinking
it
agreed
goes
down
quite
smoothly
as
i
would
expect
from
6
5
and
is
a
very
enjoyable
porter
excellent
example
of
the
style
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
has
a
unique
mix
of
flavors
that
kept
me
coming
back
to
my
glass
the
midrange
abv
makes
for
easy
drinking
a
very
nice
pickup
utimately
a
very
good
beer
that
is
light
on
slight
on
complexity
and
velvety
texture
but
is
also
flawless
in
its
design
and
exectution
probably
a
slight
dip
in
quality
compated
to
fullers
london
porter
d
definitely
enjoyable
comes
together
as
a
light
smooth
beer
with
enough
flavor
it
does
feel
a
bit
weak
on
flavor
after
the
first
few
sips
but
still
a
good
drink
drinkability
ill
try
one
more
bottle
but
that
might
be
it
sorely
disappointed
in
this
porter
d
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
for
how
drinkable
it
is
it
just
flows
down
and
i
want
to
keep
drinking
doesnt
get
cloying
too
fast
as
sometimes
happens
to
me
with
porters
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
uncomplex
for
a
porter
unfortunately
this
means
it
does
not
have
the
depth
of
other
london
porters
such
as
that
of
fullers
ive
now
had
the
london
porter
and
the
coffee
porter
both
leave
good
footprints
in
my
memory
though
the
coffee
porters
is
a
larger
imprint
not
that
this
is
bad
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
taste
of
the
past
this
is
for
you
drinkability
an
incredibly
aromatic
porter
with
a
bittersweet
taste
it
is
clear
to
see
why
meantime
are
become
such
a
respected
brewery
very
drinkable
given
the
alcohol
content
and
even
though
it
is
sold
in
a
large
750ml
bottle
it
sometimes
doesnt
feel
big
enough
d
a
pretty
good
english
porter
and
easy
to
drink
for
sure
but
not
my
favorire
example
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
off
and
the
aroma
was
lacking
but
i
also
dont
doubt
my
bottle
had
some
age
on
it
d
this
beer
tasted
a
bit
thin
and
watery
with
not
much
malt
flavor
or
depth
and
was
supported
by
a
tart
hing
but
no
hop
notes
at
all
i
found
the
overcarbonation
a
bit
frustrating
and
i
dont
think
i
will
try
it
again
just
because
there
are
better
porters
and
lower
price
points
there
were
no
off
flavors
just
no
real
flavors
at
all
taste
is
mildly
roasted
with
a
heavy
chocolate
taste
which
makes
a
sweet
impression
i
get
hints
of
cacoa
vanilla
en
cappucino
the
beers
body
is
just
right
for
this
kind
of
beer
some
sweetnes
but
not
too
sticky
bitterness
is
low
and
the
beer
is
nicely
balanced
md
smooth
refreshing
fluid
feel
creamy
on
the
tongue
with
this
type
of
review
of
course
the
drinkability
is
awesome
complex
but
with
the
body
and
color
somehow
insubstantial
not
nearly
as
tasty
or
as
sessionable
as
fullers
the
obvious
comparison
but
maybe
at
6
5
its
not
meant
to
be
just
doesnt
drink
hearty
enough
even
for
the
style
i
like
this
beer
although
im
wondering
if
american
styles
are
ruining
my
palate
what
i
mean
is
that
ive
come
to
expect
big
and
bold
rich
and
chocolatey
even
hoppy
porters
this
aint
that
but
what
it
is
is
a
drinkable
even
mildly
sessionable
version
of
a
english
porter
trying
to
review
this
beer
is
a
little
like
trying
to
write
a
5
paragraph
history
of
porter
itself
not
very
easy
i
like
it
maybe
you
will
too
up
for
the
challenge
cheers
a
good
brew
for
contemplation
though
the
flavors
are
not
aggressive
despite
their
persistence
a
highly
drinkable
porter
sweetness
and
bitterness
are
both
held
in
check
especially
if
the
bottle
is
cellared
for
a
while
with
abv
just
high
enough
to
force
you
to
savor
rather
than
session
it
well
my
bottle
was
a
gusher
which
turned
me
off
a
little
right
away
it
had
been
cooled
never
was
warm
at
all
and
wasnt
shaken
at
all
still
once
i
poured
it
the
head
was
gone
right
away
in
general
there
was
nothing
impressive
about
this
beer
at
all
but
nothing
offensive
either
i
couldnt
even
really
find
much
to
write
about
it
just
not
impressive
and
a
little
too
bland
very
nice
porter
poured
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
the
beer
is
a
rich
black
color
with
a
frothy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sufficiently
malty
with
loads
of
roasted
character
theres
also
a
notable
caramel
quality
and
a
little
distant
herbal
hop
smell
the
taste
is
very
solid
theres
lots
of
roasted
chocolate
coffee
and
grain
flavors
the
beer
has
a
substantial
bitterness
that
runs
through
the
taste
its
a
centerpiece
to
the
flavor
lingering
bitter
and
very
roasty
finish
full
mouthfeel
yet
not
overpowering
excellent
d
i
can
drink
and
drink
and
drink
this
is
a
complex
brew
with
plenty
of
beautiful
subtleties
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
coffee
version
beer
poured
a
translucent
brown
with
a
decent
tan
head
nose
is
roasted
malts
and
coffee
taste
has
a
lot
going
on
roasted
coffee
sweet
caramel
and
some
light
hops
balancing
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
fairly
smooth
but
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
subtle
beer
that
has
some
complexities
going
on
that
make
it
quite
interesting
the
taste
is
rich
zesty
but
smooth
caramelized
fruit
leaves
bark
chocolate
sweetsour
fruit
a
brownsugarraisin
sweetness
and
a
light
toastychocolaty

the
feel
is
wonderful
and
its
compelx
and
engaging
throughout
pours
a
dark
brown
colored

transparent
wruby

somewhat

has
a

fizzy

dry

pretty

has
become
one
of
my
go
to
beers
this
london
porter
has
a
deep
dark
reddishburgundy
hue
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
it
had
a
chocolate
bisquity
aroma
and
a
slight
burnt
chocolate
taste
however
it
did
carry
a
nice
thick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
very
enjoyable
and
would
drink
this
again
drinkability
not
the
greatest
drinkability
quite
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
biggest
letdowns
as
far
as
beer
goes
that
ive
ever
had
the
last
10
ounces
of
this
one
became
a
drain
pour
my
first
in
a
while
i
love
porters
but
this
one
struck
me
totally
wrong
d
it
doesnt
beat
fullers
london
porter
but
this
is
a
really
great
english
style
porter
very
unique
and
full
flavor
a
bit
lighter
in
color
and
thinner
in
mouthfeel
than
i
would
have
expected
but
still
a
very
sessionable
porter
definitely
worth
the
price
to
try
this
a
very
good
embodiment
of
what
i
consider
a
robust
porter
one
of
the
best
ive
had
totally
worth
10
every
once
and
a
while
good
show
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
large
tan
head
that
hung
around
for
awhile
until
it
settled
to
a
thick
head
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
i
was
a
bit
taken
aback
when
i
first
smelled
and
tasted
this
porter
the
aroma
has
a
soft
fruitiness
but
the
taste
is
dominated
by
smoke
a
little
fruit
and
chocolate
break
up
the
smoke
before
the
finish
some
alcohol
warmth
is
noted
the
body
is
medium
with
a
nice
soft
creamy
texture
the
abv
is
on
the
higher
side
of
english
porters
so
it
is
not
as
drinkable
and
sessionable
good
all
around
porter
with
a
nice
smokey
character
d
exceelent
beer
for
a
glass
or
two
not
an
everyday
type
of
beer
but
excellent
if
you
want
to
try
someting
good
and
very
tasty
taste
is
sweet
chocolate
sour
malt
prunes
figs
some
smoke
weak
coffee
and
creamy
caramel
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
no
ploblem
finishing
the
bottle
in
one
sitting
pours
a
four
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
deep
mahogany
color
roasted

good
carbonation

for
a
750ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
d
good
porter
though
not
as
full
bodied
as
i
like
porters
d
not
a
beer
i
had
any
problems
drinking
a
great
mild
english
porter
that
i
will
definitely
have
again
future
outlook
too
many
better
easier
to
get
choices
out
there
to
be
bothered
with
this
one
drinkability
a
nice
looking
beer
with
good
flavor
carbonation
level
is
pretty
high
if
i
had
this
alone
i
think
i
would
have
liked
it
a
little
more
but
having
it
in
a
flight
of
porters
i
see
how
many
better
porters
are
out
there
many
of
them
less
expensive
and
more
easily
available
all
in
all
though
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
up
deep
auburn
pour
with
a
short
offwhite
head
rich
aroma
of
caramel
and
malt
sweeter
than
i
expected
but
that
seems
to
be
meantimes
calling
card
bittersweet
flavors
of
malt
brown
sugar
cocoa
mixed
with
an
astringent
bite
slowdrinking
and
very
enjoyable
meantimes
london
porter
a
smooth
full
flavored
moderately
strong
ale
with
a
robust
creamy
head
this
ale
epitomizes
the
porter
for
me
in
comparison
to
a
stout
it
has
more
hop
characterstic
slightly
more
carbonation
and
is
slightly
less
dark
theres
still
ample
roasty
malt
notes
here
which
lean
more
toward
chocolate
sweetness
and
away
from
coffee
bitterness
what
makes
this
ale
really
stand
out
is
how
creamy
it
is
without
the
cloying
sweetness
which
typifies
a
milk
stout
or
some
brown
ales
being
a
british
micro
its
not
an
extreme
ale
but
it
has
a
respectable
6
5
abv
this
is
a
porter
that
i
could
drink
any
time
and
all
the
time
well
balanced
between
hops
and
malts
complex
in
flavor
and
rich
smooth
creamy
and
full
bodied
d
a
good
porter
with
some
wide
complexity
and
dark
earthy
notes
makes
this
true
to
style
and
true
to
drink
overall
a
tasty
porter
pretty
drinkable
though
i
prefer
more
flavor
to
balance
the
alcohol
against
and
more
body
if
the
alchol
is
going
to
be
turned
up
to
6
5
d
i
had
no
problem
putting
away
this
750
it
was
a
very
nice
balanced
porter
not
disappointing
in
any
aspect
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
dark
deep
colablack
color
that
was
not
quite
opaque
with
some
hints
of
red
when
held
up
to
light
it
produced
a
nice
a
dark
tan
2
finger
head
that
was
compact
the
head
seemed
to
linger
for
the
right
amount
of
time
it
also
produced
a
nice
deep
roasted
malt
aroma
that
had
a
hint
of
smokiness
to
it
also
hints
of
molasses
some
alcohol
as
it
warmed
and
i
think
i
also
got
a
little
coffee
or
chocolate
could
have
been
a
little
more
pronounced
the
taste
was
exceptional
huge
deep
roasted
malt
with
very
subtle
hints
of
the
alcohol
a
very
lite
touch
of
sweetness
and
as
i
neared
the
end
i
got
some
coffee
or
chocolate
i
could
not
really
distinguish
maybe
if
i
had
bought
more
than
one
bottle
to
be
updated
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
i
thought
that
it
would
have
felt
thicker
but
it
was
very
smooth
very
creamy
and
solid
like
a
good
porter
should
be
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
and
i
could
have
drank
more
if
i
had
bought
more
than
one
bottle
if
you
are
a
fan
of
beer
you
need
to
try
this
one
this
will
become
a
staple
in
my
house
dark
brown
with
flashes
of
ruby
large
head
that
takes
the
early
train
out
it
carries
an
aroma
of
toasted
nuts
and
roasted
malt
along
with
a
whiff
of
alcohol
coffee
molasses
booze
in
the
taste
taste
is
a
little
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
what
really
takes
away
from
this
historic
brew
recipe
when
grading
it
by
modern
standards
its
thin
body
decreases
the
overall
flavor
and
cannot
sufficiently
conceal
the
abv
it
tastes
like
a
high
abv
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
unique
porter
to
drink
certainly
enjoyable
and
fun
to
picture
all
the
crazy
18th
century
sailors
and
pirates
guzzling
this
stuff
d
not
my
most
wordy
review
canes
football
is
on
all
you
need
to
know
is
that
meantime
has
done
it
again
like
its
ipa
an
excellent
recreation
of
a
classic
style
this
stuff
is
great
it
was
a
bit
pricey
at
10
a
750ml
but
it
was
worth
it
i
wish
it
was
sold
in
six
packs
because
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
clear
dark
brown
not
quite
opaque
with
a
reddish
tint
it
poured
with
a
two
finger
cap
of
light
tan
foam
quite
chunky
the
aroma
was
roasty
and
burnt
with
some
toffee
and
molasses
lactose
and
chocolate
plus
a
hint
of
smoke
bitterness
was
restrained
but
became
a
little
more
forceful
in
the
finish
it
started
off
biscuity
and
malty
becoming
fruity
and
roasted
in
the
middle
finished
with
some
chocolate
pretty
good
decent
texture
medium
bodied
but
carbonation
was
a
little
coarse
some
dryness
from
the
dark
malts
quite
drinkable
overall
a
solid
english
porter
a
750ml
bottle
that
i
thought
was
a
real
bargain
at
5
00
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
black
in
color
with
red
highlights
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
was
mostly
roasted
malt
quite
tasteful
with
coffee
and
a
little
chocolate
a
bit
on
the
bubbly
side
very
nice
beer
overall
meantime
london
porter
is
a
really
good
english
porter
that
is
worth
another
purchase
recommended
holly
crap
this
is
a
great
porter
i
dont
think
i
can
ever
give
out
a
perfect
score
but
this
came
close
if
you
dont
pick
this
stuff
up
you
are
a
fool
it
went
great
with
the
grilled
pork
chops
i
had
for
lunch
as
well
it
must
have
been
tough
for
washington
to
boycott
his
beloved
porter
if
it
indeed
tasted
like
this
the
flavor
is
what
i
would
expect
for
a
recreation
of
an
english
porter
husky
organic
malt
notes
blend
with
some
dark
fruit
biscuit
and
sourness
bitter
bakers
chocolate
lingers
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
unnecessarily
overcarbonated
for
my
palate
other
than
that
the
mediumthin
body
is
quite
smooth
and
refreshing
all
in
all
this
was
a
decent
porter
fairly
drinkable
but
not
worth
the
asking
price
mouthfeel
is
great
bubbly
and
full
bodied
not
stoutlike
thickness
but
just
right
for
a
porter
a
little
bitter
aftertaste
what
an
enjoyable
porter
i
love
the
english
style
with
the
low
amount
of
hops
all
malt
its
fantastic
recommended
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
from
wilderness
wines
in
rangely
pours
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
couple
inches
of
slowlydissipating
rocky
light
tan
head
smells
roasty
chocolatey
earthy
and
slightly
fruity
tastes
very
roasty
with
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
nuttiness
with
some
caramel
molasses
and
hints
of
licorice
flavors
are
very
wellbalanced
complex
and
somewhat
subtle
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
this
a
solid
example
of
the
style
for
sure
very
tasty
drinkable
and
enjoyable
having
said
that
its
unfortunately
an
occasional
treat
at
the
price
d
this
is
an
outstanding
porter
one
of
the
best
that
ive
ever
had
when
poured
it
was
close
to
black
in
color
with
a
little
bit
of
tan
foam
and
some
lace
on
the
side
of
my
glass
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
along
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
spice
the
taste
had
a
bitter
tart
finish
on
the
palate
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
a
just
a
hint
of
prunes
nicely
balance
even
with
the
tart
bitterness
it
did
seem
to
have
a
more
mellow
flavor
when
it
got
a
little
warmer
overall
this
isnt
really
a
mind
blowing
experience
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
americanstyle
porters
quite
good
and
well
worth
a
try
d
not
really
but
i
will
have
another
to
rerate
this
possibly
infected
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
of
large
dark
tan
bubbles
mild
carbonation
was
apparent
but
light
enough
to
let
the
head
subside
over
the
course
of
a
minute
or
two
nose
was
clean
with
mild
dark
lightly
roasted
malts
nothing
overpowering
in
the
nose
flavor
was
smooth
and
dominated
by
a
soft
dark
roasty
malt
flavor
with
a
light
alcohol
taste
peeking
out
from
behind
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
thick
without
being
heavy
and
left
the
flavor
sitting
on
the
tongue
after
the
swallow
drinkability
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
more
interesting
than
it
is
delicious
it
is
good
yet
i
dont
see
myself
picking
up
another
10
bottle
in
the
near
future
the
aroma
that
mostly
came
through
was
roasted
malts
and
slight
chocolate
the
taste
was
sweet
with
known
flavor
suspects
like
chocolate
and
nuttiness
it
was
highly
carbonated
like
a
soda
pop
and
thin
in
the
mouth
to
me
it
was
not
overly
complex
and
a
good
middle
of
the
road
porter
light
brown
color
and
this
beer
had
a
nice
tan
head
lacing
was
decent
smell
of
chocolate
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
coffee
slight
roasted
tones
with
good
malt
subtle
hops
kind
of
light
mouthfeel
only
thing
i
didnt
care
for
but
it
made
at
the
same
time
a
real
quaffing
porter
like
the
ipa
i
thought
this
beer
way
overpriced
but
i
liked
it
more
than
their
ipa
d
cool
beer
but
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
maybe
my
bottle
was
bad
i
will
try
this
again
though
d
i
would
drink
this
fairly
often
if
it
were
available
in
smaller
bottles
at
19aus
per
750ml
bottle
its
a
bit
too
much
for
regular
consumption
d
not
bad
good
abv
makes
it
easy
to
drink
and
the
flavor
backs
that
up
recommended
d
not
bad
pretty
sweet
coming
from
the
guinness
i
just
had
i
know
i
know
but
cmon
i
imagine
many
of
us
have
fallen
victim
to
st
patricks
day
but
not
overpowering
enjoyable
but
im
glad
im
splitting
half
the
bottle
with
my
gf
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
one
inch
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
vanilla
cream
and
burnt
malt
the
taste
is
of
burnt
caramel
with
a
moderate
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
porter
that
i
could
drink
again
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
good
english
porter
however
i
felt
that
the
packaging
made
it
seem
like
it
should
have
been
more
than
it
was
it
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
closer
to
room
temp
served
around
5560
deg
initially
but
didnt
get
any
other
reaction
than
oh
thats
a
good
porter
dark
ruby
red
brown
with
tan
edges
and
a
nice
head
of
foam
that
whisps
down
slowly
aromas
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
slight
coffee
and
medicinal
hop
alphas
taste
is
smooth
and
together
with
no
one
component
stealing
the
show
bready
malts
and
green
hop
back
palate
kicks
round
it
out
nicely
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
but
this
one
is
just
kinda
boring
and
gets
old
after
a
while
not
bad
but
nothing
new
meantime
wont
win
any
awards
for
complexity
but
its
actually
not
bad
and
would
make
a
good
intro
to
the
style
for
people
who
hate
dark
beer
interesting
historical
brew
poured
a
750
into
a
chimay
chalice
poured
a
dark
mahogany
with
ruby
tones
and
a
nice
beige
head
that
melded
into
a
thin
layer
on
the
beer
aroma
is
of
chocolate
raisins
and
a
bit
of
coffee
taste
well
thats
where
the
marks
start
to
drop
this
beer
has
what
i
consider
the
worst
flavor
that
can
be
added
to
a
beer
liquid
smoke
why
just
explain
to
me
why
its
a
needed
flavor
it
tastes
like
salt
salt
and
over
cooked
beef
with
bad
bbq
sauce
i
hate
that
taste
everything
else
is
lost
in
the
liquid
smoke
mouthfeel
is
good
for
a
porter
a
bit
fuller
i
think
that
people
that
like
that
flavor
would
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
will
never
be
buying
this
beer
again
reminds
me
of
the
fullers
porter
a
bit
though
this
seems
a
bit
sweeter
and
more
sour
wish
i
had
more
this
drinks
far
too
quick
d
i
like
their
historical
recreations
of
oldtimey
beers
definitely
creative
i
am
fine
splitting
one
of
these
i
enjoyed
the
ipa
slightly
more
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
good
beer
to
sip
for
a
long
while
pours
a
dark
black
with
ruby
highlights
good
white
head
but
dissipates
fast
the
nose
is
thin
but
smells
a
bit
of
malt
and
the
tiniest
grainy
cherry
smell
taste
is
a
wonderful
plethora
of
flavor
some
mocha
type
choco
coffee
action
with
nice
malt
and
grain
background
finish
has
the
slight
bitterness
of
hop
kick
this
is
a
tasty
porter
that
i
recommend
and
im
pretty
sure
this
is
the
official
brew
of
the
london
silly
nannies
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
nose
is
thick
malts
caramel
is
there
too
flavor
is
rich
with
malted
caramel
like
flavors
mild
roasted
tones
smooth
sweet
edge
to
it
i
think
that
defines
this
one
smooth
smooth
carbonation
and
a
good
liquid
feel
make
this
a
nice
one
to
try
definitely
worth
it
had
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
appropriate
glassware
as
usual
pours
black
with
a
head
that
quickly
fades
but
that
leaves
some
very
good
lacing
smells
fruity
with
prunesblack
licorice
and
stewed
apples
tastes
winey
and
fruity
with
similar
fruit
as
are
in
the
aromas
cocoa
and
a
bit
of
coffee
as
well
mouthfeelis
smooth
and
creamy
and
it
is
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
companys
beers
english
styles
done
very
well
with
just
a
bit
of
an
american
edge
this
one
is
no
exception
one
of
my
favorite
english
porters
tasty
and
smooth
consistent
flavour
a
delight
with
food
or
even
by
itself
medium
mouthfeel
i
had
higher
expectations
but
in
hindsight
i
would
stick
to
fullers
or
sam
smith
for
porters
drinkability
a
solid
5
on
the
drinkability
here
creamy
smooth
and
ultra
drinkable
i
have
bought
the
rest
of
the
supply
that
the
store
had
and
i
will
hoard
the
last
bottle
for
many
days
to
come
although
the
urge
is
here
already
with
14
of
the
bottle
still
remaining
d
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
if
you
like
porters
this
is
a
must
for
a
porter
fan
fit
for
a
king
or
george
washington
i
have
no
idea
how
accurate
the
replication
is
but
this
is
an
amazing
brew
a
porter
of
this
stature
would
serve
well
as
a
staple
in
any
bar
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
with
a
freshness
date
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
it
had
an
average
sized
beige
head
that
settled
into
a
thin
collar
a
little
lacing
and
carb
the
aroma
was
roasted
malts
some
chocolate
and
smoke
the
taste
was
good
with
a
nice
smoky
feel
with
coffee
and
chocolate
tones
good
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
really
good
porter
i
enjoyed
the
smoky
twist
and
could
see
a
bottle
going
down
every
few
months
highly
recommend
4
rr
t
y
drinkability
while
there
is
a
lot
to
this
beer
i
find
it
is
more
interesting
to
describe
than
enjoyable
to
taste
i
have
now
had
it
twice
and
each
time
there
is
something
different
that
is
a
demerit
the
first
time
there
was
too
much
charcoal
and
the
second
time
too
much
carbonation
ill
put
this
in
the
interesting
category
something
unique
and
different
out
of
england
as
with
all
historic
replica
brews
i
wonder
how
true
to
history
it
is
something
we
will
never
know
no
matter
overall
i
liked
it
well
enough
the
pour
from
the
750ml
cork
and
caged
bottle
is
a
deep
clear
brown
to
almost
black
with
significant
ruby
highlights
head
is
light
chocolate
in
color
the
texture
creamy
and
the
size
exceptional
as
it
fades
to
nothingness
the
lacing
provides
a
firm
sheet
to
surround
the
glass
nose
has
a
nice
toasted
grain
aroma
sweet
with
hints
of
toffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
quite
pleasing
to
the
nose
and
eyes
start
is
pleasantly
malty
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
top
is
light
to
moderate
on
the
palate
finish
is
benevolent
in
its
acidity
the
hops
amiable
in
their
spiciness
sweet
to
the
end
with
a
dry
aftertaste
quite
a
nice
porter
having
sampled
a
few
of
their
beers
they
seem
to
be
an
excellent
brewery
pours
out
a
ruby
tinged
cherry
finished
wood
with
a
creamy
khaki
head
which
leaves
little
bits
of
lace
smell
has
notes
of
dried
dark
fruits
fresh
berries
chocolate
cane
syrup
and
coffee
i
can
pick
up
a
touch
of
smokiness
flavor
is
very
full
and
rich
with
more
fresh
fruitiness
coming
out
over
the
dried
ones
but
i
still
surely
pick
up
some
raisin
and
dried
fig
nice
mix
of
breadiness
with
the
sweetness
reminds
me
of
biscuits
and
cane
syrup
a
touch
of
cherry
presses
on
through
the
middle
along
with
some
big
chocolate
finishes
with
roastiness
of
coffee
aftertaste
lingers
on
and
on
with
big
emphasis
on
cane
syrup
preserved
figs
and
coffee
all
this
reminiscent
of
breakfast
light
twang
in
the
finish
as
well
to
mention
mouthfeel
is
moderate
in
weight
has
a
gentle
carbonation
but
can
be
just
a
bit
sticky
drinkability
is
fine
but
the
sweetness
could
hold
me
back
delicious
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
id
pay
this
much
for
it
again
comment
i
like
the
trend
in
craft
beers
to
find
historic
recipes
this
porter
was
rich
and
complex
hat
tip
to
the
brewery
d
while
perhaps
not
my
absolute
favorite
interpretation
this
is
definitely
what
i
think
of
when
i
hear
the
world
porter
seems
like
all
the
ducks
are
in
a
row
on
this
one
with
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
matching
the
historical
porter
flavor
profile
pours
black
as
the
african
night
smells
good
to
the
last
drop
maxwell
house
the
taste
calgon
takes
away
to
a
land
of
deep
malty
chocolatey
roasty
toasty
goodyness
the
triangulation
of
belgian
sensiblities
english
personality
and
a
german
attitude
gives
this
beer
its
unique
32
pieces
of
flair
to
keep
you
coming
back
drinkability
tore
through
this
750ml
bottle
easily
but
best
taken
pretty
slow
to
savor
the
complex
malt
profile
here
ill
definitely
be
buying
this
again
to
punctuate
special
occasions
drinkability
tasty
and
traditional
i
am
not
going
to
slam
this
beer
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
very
over
rated
and
expensive
for
what
it
is
the
marketing
and
packaging
is
top
notch
the
product
however
doesnt
live
up
to
hype
taste
is
more
of
the
aroma
with
the
toasted
nutty
malt
flavors
showing
through
and
some
of
the
brown
sugar
sweetness
noted
in
the
aroma
as
well
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
fruity
with
a
smoked
peat
pressence
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
and
has
a
nice
carbonation
level
this
porter
is
extremely
drinkable
a
very
good
english
porter
and
i
will
purchase
again
despite
the
slightly
high
price
tag
not
bad
but
at
9
95
not
a
beer
id
like
to
sample
too
often
fullers
example
is
more
affordable
by
volume
and
at
least
as
good
as
this
d
this
definitely
shows
signs
of
brown
ale
and
scotch
ale
but
that
just
makes
it
more
complex
i
am
guessing
this
is
what
old
time
porters
drank
like
very
nice
pours
clear
and
almost
opaque
with
mahogany
hues
and
a
full
wispy
light
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
some
lacing
follows
the
smell
is
a
creamy
milky
tootsie
roll
chocolate
medium
bodied
light
textured
the
mouth
feel
tingles
at
first
from
the
carbonation
then
it
gives
way
to
a
smooth
creaminess
full
flavored
the
rich
malty
taste
is
lightly
roasted
with
notes
of
semisweet
chocolate
a
roasted
latte
lingers
lightly
in
the
finish
a
nice
drinker
really
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
one
overall
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
750ml
might
be
enough
i
shared
this
with
my
wife
and
she
really
liked
the
flavor
so
i
would
probably
get
this
again
to
share
with
her
overall
an
interesting
beer
they
did
a
good
job
of
recreating
the
old
porter
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
newer
versions
still
worth
trying
for
sure
drinkability
is
good
the
only
thing
bringing
it
down
is
the
price
a
nice
enjoyable
treat
from
a
good
brewery
cheers
poured

still
sturdy

for

fans

aficionados
of

will

im

this
is
the

ive
had
next
to
anchor

to
me
a

leave
me
desiring
more
they
are
full

flavorful
enough
the

porter
is
everything
im
looking
for
in
a
porter
i
highly
recommend
it
pass
the

this
is
one
of
the
finest
english
porters
ive
ever
had
deep
dark
brown
colour
in
the
glass
huge
frothy
tan
head
which
lasted
a
very
long

of
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
very
surprised
by
the
mild
smoky
taste
finishes
very
clean
with
a
slight
coffee
bitterness
flavour
and
aromas
are
all
very
subtle
and
well
balanced

it
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable

on
an
aside
excellent
website
for
this

and
the

this
is

london
porter
drinkability
good
session
beer
the
bottle
was
split
three
ways
for
this
tasting
unfortunately
the
price
tag
is
not
as
session
as
the
beer
all
together
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
but
if
i
were
offered
a
glass
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
thin

yet
mild
very
well
done
every

of
this

shines

never

lacing
this

after
about

minutes
this
is
one
of
the
finest
tasting
porters
i
have
ever
tasted
i
would
love
to
have
an
endless
supply
this
is
a
very
pleasant
sipping
beer
really
more
in
the
tradition
of
what
we
in
the
usa
think
of
as
scottish
ale
very
mellow
smoky
and
malty
like
sipping
a
smoky
scotch
alexander
to
relax
very
much
superior
to
the

this
is

of
the
most
true
to

delicious
and
drinkable
porters
ive
encountered
an
interesting
historic
brew
overall
a
very
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
quite
a
bit
different
than
other
porters
ive
had
but
not
in
a
bad
way
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
on
the
pricey
side
i
paid
7
00
for
the
bottle
but
got
it
marked
down
from
9
other
comments
the
bottleconditioning
makes
this
one
of
the
liveliest
porters
ive
had
the
cork
came
off
with
a
tremendous
pop
very
tasty
beer
it
gets
a
bit
sweeter
and
much
more
complex
as
it
warms
up
in
the
glass
overall
a
great
porter
strongly
recommended
a
mean
london
porter
alright
fabulous
stuff
recommended
a
full
mouth
with
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
complex
porter
that
doesnt
go
overboard
with
the
roasty
aromas
and
flavors
i
like
it
this
ended
up
being
very
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
it
poured
a
hazy
brown
nearly
as
light
as
an
english
brown
ale
it
didnt
look
anything
like
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
porter
smell
is
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
toffee
the
taste
is
nearly
all
malt
with
little
or
no
hops
up
front
and
only
a
slight
hop
bitterness
towards
the
end
quite
lovely
especially
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
very
very
smooth
and
creamy
almost
chewy
again
as
it
warms
this
was
a
good
porter
peculiar
look
about
it
for
a
porter
but
everything
else
was
quite
nice
pours
a
muddy
dark

with
a
moderate
head
of

bubbles

is

is

in
the
aftertaste
very
nice

and

and
chocolate
upfront
burnt
dark
roast
coffee
in
the
finish
takes
on
a
woody

md
softlycarbonated
very
smooth
on
the

with
a
lighter
body
than
its

and
foretaste
suggest
it
seems
eightmoremonth
ageing
hasnt
changed
the
already
soft
palate
too
much
but
the
flavour
seems
to
be
slightly
more
mellow
than
my
last
bottle
and
enjoys
a
longer
aftertaste
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
a
wellcrafted
fruity
as
well
as
malty
utterly
approachable
porter
to
savour
with
mates

2
out
of
the
three
meantime
beers
i
have
tried
i
enjoyed
a
lot
so
clearly
this
brewery
is
doing
something
right
inky
black
beer
i
could
not
detect
any
light
through
the
glass
at
all
its
topped
by
a
thick
tan
head
the
head
receded
quickly
but
left
a
delicate
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
all
roast
malt
it
has
a
lot
of
espresso
light
chocolate
and
a
mild
smoky
character
the
flavor
really
brings
the
roasted
malt
forward
surprisingly
smoky
with
more
of
the
espresso
bitter
chocolate
a
good
bitterness
attacks
midway
through
the
flavor
and
lasts
into
the
finish
which
is
composed
of
more
coffee
flavors
smooth
and
rich
mouth
feel
this
is
a
wonderfully
drinkable
london
porter
overall
an
excellent
porter
recommended
a
great
beer
very
interesting
porter
dark
copper
color
untypicallly
light
considering
the
style
jammy
fruits
in
the
nose
with
hints
of
plums
and
berries
not
your
typical
chocolate
coffee
porter
aromas
caramel
flavors
abound
with
a
variety
of
fruits
nice
flavor
with
a
mild
body
corked
and
caged
750ml
almost
brown
with
a
tall
tan
head
that
left
some
webbings
of
lace
around
the
glass
aroma
was
full
of
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
some
light
fruit
was
there
as
well
the
flavor
started
off
with
more
sweet
caramel
and
light
roasted
malt
notes
mild
fruit
and
chocolate
followed
finished
sweet
and
dry
a
good
solid
flavor
for
the
style
good
body
that
was
very
smooth
going
down
and
quite
drinkable
as
well
a
good
solid
english
style
porter
that
is
subtle
yet
still
has
plenty
of
flavor
very
drinkable
so
out
of
type
of
what
i
expected
worth
the9
00
a
bottle
imho
this
is
probably
what
porters
tasted
like
in
dickens
day
imo
drinkability
is
really
quite
good
had
limited
expectations
for
this
brew
and
it
really
surpassed
my
expectations
highly
drinkable
well
made
and
enjoyable
porter
not
quite
up
to
the
standards
of
a
fullers
but
still
enjoyable
and
worth
the
relatively
steep
pricetag
the
aroma
was
clean
with
mild
dark
malts
nothing
overpowering
in
the
nose
flavor
was
smooth
and
dominated
by
a
soft
dark
roasty
malt
flavor
with
a
light
alcohol
taste
peeking
out
from
behind
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
thick
without
being
heavy
and
left
the
flavor
sitting
on
the
tongue
after
the
swallow
good
looking
mild
aroma
and
great
smooth
flavor
are
what
makes
this
beer
so
easy
to
drink
somewhat
sharp
coffee
aroma
but
there
is
a
tinge
of
some
sweet
malt
as
well
amber
brown
in
color
with
a
quarter
sized
mocha
head
almost
smokey
malted
fore
with
some
brown
sugar
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
british
porters
tend
to
be
lighter
in
color
and
less
roasty
and
this
one
is
no
different
the
finish
is
mild
and
tangy
rather
than
mildy
bitter
and
roasty
like
many
american
made
porters
i
think
i
have
come
to
favor
the
american
approach
because
while
this
is
good
it
isnt
exactly
knocking
my
socks
i
never
knew
a
porter
could
be
so
good
smoky
burnt
malt
dark
chocolate
and
piney
hops
are
fused
into
layers
this
should
pair
well
with
filet
mignon
tastes
and
smells
more
vinous
as
it
warms
thick
smooth
mouthfeel
as
this
is
the
best
porter
ive
ever
had
it
is
insanely
drinkable
i
just
want
to
fnow
why
it
is
13
for
750ml
a
very
pleasing
beer
that
i
havent
seen
at
my
local
liqour
store
and
picked
up
on
a
sort
of
whim
very
pleased
with
results
drinkability
a
very
solid
and
above
average
beer
thanks
to
lucksevens82
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
deep
brown
with
an
amber

in

note
that
comes
thru
late
even
more
as
i
drink
morenice
creamy
mouthfeel
holds
up

the
dryish

making
it
very
drinkable
is
it
worth
11
99well
not
so
sure
about
that
but
a
very
well
done
porter
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
in
awhile
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
34
tan
head
over
the
brown
brew
with
burgundy
highlights
head
lasts
well
and
lacing
is
good
aroma
is
dark
malts
with
tinges
of
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
follows
the
nose
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
close
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
excellent
with
the
somewhat
light
body
reminding
me
that
the
style
was
originally
that
way
so
that
porters
could
drink
this
style
and
still
get
their
work
done
although
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
in
this
example
to
meet
that
usage
anyways
enjoyable
brew
for
sure
and
worth
searching
out
at
first
i
was
ho
hum
on
this
after
2
glasses
really
dig
it
over
all
damn
enjoyable
maybe
not
the
all
around
that
the
old
raspy
is
but
what
is
i
will
be
buying
this
again
fairly
drinkable
i
am
going
to
chill
the
rest
of
teh
bottle
and
try
at
a
colder
temp
to
see
what
changes
i
see
in
taste
and
feel
however
solid
porter
i
like
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
palate
that
has
a
certain
fullness
to
it
despite
being
quite
light
the
beer
finishes
with
a
dry
burnt
grain
character
and
a
solid
dark
chocolate
note
up
front
this
tastes
of
sweetened
black
coffee
it
also
has
note
of
biscuit
malt
and
brown
malt
the
finish
is
quite
nice
with
a
complex
malt
profile
up
front
it
is
not
quite
so
complex
though
even
a
bit
simplistic
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
sweet
both
of
these
clash
and
downplay
the
nice
malt
profile
which
is
in
the
finish
lightish
bodied
but
taut
of
structure
and
detail
this
is
a
phenom
so
drinkable
that
one
begins
to
understand
why
george
washington
and
his
peers
wore
those
ridiculous
wigs
but
not
so
drinkable
or
stimulating
as
to
make
any
sense
of
an
i
for
denal
and
there
is
not
enough
of
this
in
the
world
to
make
51659
appear
as
anything
other
than
an
american
zipcode
beer
is
good
happy
beering
peaceful
calm
and
focused
absolutely
nothing
in
the
way
overall
an
excellent
porter
its
hard
to
find
good
porters
in
this
area
and
im
very
glad
ive
found
this
one
i
cant
wait
to
try
their
ipa
tastes
of
coffee
and
malts
are
standing
out
for
sure
nice
lacing
taste
is
smoothe
with
an
even
finish

nice

seeping
through
a

foam
covers
the
top
brussels
lacing
aroma
is
comprised
of
caramel

roasted

the
mouth
is

o
overall
a
nice
porter
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
nose
though
the
taste
is
a
bit
chalky
worth
checking
out
would
have
it
again
overall
a
really
top
notch
porter
in
my
opinion
i
would
highly
recommend
this
for
the
winter
season
great
brew
from
schlafly
overall
i
enjoyed
this
porter
but
the
carbonation
is
too
high
and
it
feels
like
i
am
drinking
a
aal
overall
just
a
standard
everyday
solid
porter
good
flavors
good
feel
and
a
good
overall
and
dark
beer
to
drink
regularly
overall
a
vanilla
presence
comes
on
more
the
longer
i
drink
this
very
good
tasting
porter
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
rather
bland
tasteless
outofbalance
porter
when
nothing
sticks
out
good
or
bad
it
must
be
a
good
one
bang
on
the
style
overall
decent
but
average
porter
poured
into
pint
glass
appearance
is
deep
and
dark
with
deep
brown
highlights
dense
brown
head
forms
and
has
good
retention
the
nose
has
dark
fruit
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
notes
of
plum
and
raisin
come
through
as
well
taste
is
primarily
roasted
and
bitter
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
is
present
as
this
finishes
mouthfeel
provides
a
decent
body
with
sharp
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
porter
some
decent
flavors
but
nothing
to
keep
me
coming
back
very
drinkable
yet
well
crafted
and
complex
porter
i
wish
we
had
access
to
schlafly
this
beers
pretty
good
there
are
better
porters
out
there
but
this
ones
pretty
affordable
to
boot
this
is
a
nice
easy
to
porter
to
drink
its
on
the
inoffensive
side
so
the
lack
of
bold
flavors
could
be
seen
in
a
positive
or
negative
light
regardless
its
well
made
and
certainly
a
sessionable
option
o
this
is
the
first
schlafly
beer
that
has
really
disappointed
me
and
im
hoping
that
something
was
wrong
with
the
last
bottle
i
drank
nothing
about
this
beer
indicates
that
it
is
or
ever
was
a
quality
porter
taste
is
a
bit
thin
and
has
some
definite
fruitiness
tangy
almost
in
a
souring
way
dont
think
it
is
infected
but
certainly
different
still
maintains
some
sweetness
and
the
malt
profile
is
really
nice
and
smooth
hops
get
a
bit
leafy
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
of
a
drying
effect
i
like
it
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
o
its
just
one
more
off
my
list
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
i
will
bother
revisiting
anytime
soon
its
decent
enough
to
try
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
a
minimal
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
palate
an
interesting
little
beer
decent
enough
porter
minimal
sweetness
up
front
minor
malt
roast
bitterness
in
back
not
bad
taste
is
mild
but
balanced
and
very
appealing
hints
of
coffee
come
in
here
along
with
some
chocolate
malts
theres
an
evident
roastiness
but
its
not
bitter
or
burnt
a
perfectly
balanced
and
enjoyable
porter
and
one
to
revisit
for
sure
pours
a
chocolaty
brown
without
much
of
a
head
on
it
the
nose
consists
of
chocolates
and
a
bit
of
smoke
the
palate
follows
the
nose
starts
off
a
little
chocolaty
rand
then
fades
to
more
of
a
burnt
malt
coffee
smokey
flavor
there
is
also
a
touch
of
grain
in
the
mix
as
well
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
goes
down
smoothly
pretty
decent
porter
nothing
to
crazy
but
sessionable
nonetheless
definitely
worth
a
shot
o
decent
beer
sort
of
a
middle
of
the
road
kind
of
beer
would
like
to
try
this
on

12

a
single

the
beer
pours
mostly
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
red
tints
along
with
an
inch
tan
head
that
stays
around
a
while
theres
a
good
amount
of

too
aroma
is
roasted

coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
nuts
and
a
bit
of
dark

taste
is
similar
to
the

it
tastes

bittersweet
chocolate
grain
and
nuts
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
smooth
a
bit
slick
goes
down
easy
and
has

i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
id
buy
this
more
often
if
it
was
available
in
ohio
too
bad
for
me
its
one
of
schlaflys
seasonal
beers
and
not
available
year
round
overall
impression
tasting
this
cherry
covered
espresso
bean
flavor
was
so
crazy
not
sure
they
were
going
for
this
but
it
came
across
when
i
went
to
enjoy
it
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
body
in
this
brew
also
still
very
good
and
would
like
to
now
go
pick
up
a
6pack
and
see
if
this
flavor
is
in
these
as
well
this
is
a
very
solid
everyday
porter
that
schlafly
should
have
available
yearround
at
5
4
abv
per
the
schlafly
website
and
refreshing
quality
this
could
be
a
standard
session
porter
o
i
know
its
a
good
beer
but
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
hoppy
i
wasnt
able
to
get
over
that
fact
and
its
score
suffered
easy
drinking
porter
not
great
but
solid
just
another
example
of
how
schafly
turns
out
on
point
examples
of
styles
when
it
mass
bottles
them
need
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
their
coffee
stout
pretty
similar
im
thinking
this
stuff
is
just
ok
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
a
nice
take
on
a
style
that
sometimes
doesnt
get
attention
o
this
is
a
very
nice
porter
im
glad
schlafly
added
this
to
their
lineup
the
consistency
in
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
appropriate
for
the
style
and
distinguishes
it
from
a
stout
this
is
definitely
going
to
give
founders
porter
a
challenge
for
space
on
the
shelf
in
my
beer
fridge
overall
its
a
tasty
porter
id
like
to
try
some
of
their
other
versions
of
this
porter
too
medium
bodied
firm
but
round
pretty
clean
and
well
balanced
not
a
showstopper
but
a
solid
porter
overall
some
might
criticize
this
for
being
too
light
but
this
isnt
an
american
robust
porter
and
its
not
fair
to
judge
it
as
such
as
an
english
porter
its
onpoint
true
to
style
and
quite
tasty
by
the
way
b
at
7
99
overall
not
bad
nothing
ground
breaking
here
and
i
wish
there
was
more
boldness
to
it
id
drink
it
again
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
screw
drinking
this
again
in
fact
this
will
make
me
never
taste
another
schlafly
beer
for
at
least
two
years
ill
have
to
try
again
down
the
road
i
cant
believe
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
and
a
small
tan
head
with
decent
retention
aromas
of
roasted
and
toasted
malt
with
a
little
chocolate
taste
is
pretty
solid
with
notes
of
chocolated
and
roasted
coffee
overall
a
decently
drinkable
porter
not
the
best
ive
had
but
certainly
not
the
worst
im
as
big
a
booster
of
schlafly
as
anyone
but
this
offering
is
a
real
dog
not
sure
how
a
brewery
capable
of
hitting
such
heights
with
their
oatmeal
stout
can
fail
so
miserably
with
a
related
style
a
mystery
indeed
and
one
i
hope
the
folks
at
schlafly
solve
before
next
years
porter
is
released
the
taste
is
good
giving
equal
bits
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
that
nice
roasted
sense
the
feel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
nicely
crispy
at
the
end
solid
drinkable
porter
the
color
was
good
a
dark
brownblack
liquid
with
a
weak
foam
head
the
aroma
was
faint
with
the
smell
of
malt
the
taste
was
good
with
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
coming
through
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
sharp
with
a
very
sharp
finish
the
drinkability
was
very
good
smooth
dark
nice
yeasty
head
when
i
first
opened
the
bottle
it
foamed
for
longer
than
1
minute
and
kept
foaming
after
every
sip
after
that
bottle
i
had
was
way
too
overcarbonated
and
harsh
on
the
throat
not
a
pleasant
drink
or
feel
at
all
maybe
it
was
just
a
bad
batch
but
i
wont
be
buying
anymore
pours
very
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
little
touches
of
foam
nutty
malty
nose
slight
coffee
very
creamy
taste
strong
coffee
bitter
which
holds
throughout
smooth
rich
bitter
strong
porter
enjoyed
it
greatly
o
pretty
good
and
a
lot
better
then
the
few
other
beers
i
have
had
from
this
company
but
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
well
within
the
style
the
acidity
in
the
flavor
is
a
bit
high
for
my
taste
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
it
is
surprisingly
sessionable
despite
its
abv
and
acidity
notes
very
drinkable
a
good
one
to
pick
up
cheers
omost
likely
cooperstowns
best
beer
a
solid
porter
benchwarmer
is
aptly
named
while
it
no
doubt
has
what
it
takes
to
make
the
regular
lineup
in
many
mainstream
drinkers
beer
fridges
good
as
it
is
i
dont
think
itll
be
getting
another
callup
from
me
theres
just
much
more
gifted
porters
out
there
that
are
worthy
of
the
playing
time
still
if
you
happen
to
find
a
bottle
why
not
give
it
a
tryout
overall
very
well
done
and
nicely
balanced
o
decent
not
great
i
wish
i
knew
whether
this
one
is
fresh
got
it
at
the
local
price
chopper
as
a
singleton
there
was
only
one
other
one
left
so
im
guessing
theyre
going
through
stock
quickly
but
you
never
know
medium
bodied
smooth
very
drinkable
low
carbonation
well
balanced
but
not
really
complex
all
in
all
a
good
porter
that
i
would
have
again
easy
drinker
very
enjoyable
a
solid
english
pale
ale
another
good
beer
from
a
small
beer
crafter
my
only
knock
is
that
this
beer
is
a
little
thin
but
otherwise
this
beer
will
get
a
spot
in
my
starting
lineup
the
next
time
i
see
it
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
amber
hues
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
poured
with
a
brief
short
beige
head
that
quickly
reduced
to
thin
wisps
earthy
musty
roasted
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
sweet
dark
fruit
smooth
and
light
bodied
with
delicate
carbonation
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
up
front
again
with
sweet
dark
fruit
flavors
in
the
background
a
bit
of
dark
roasted
coffee
flavors
and
a
smoky
flavor
toward
the
finish
as
the
bitter
hoppiness
shines
through
finishes
lighty
bitter
and
dry
very
tasty
this
is
definately
one
to
serve
to
your
friends
and
family
o
a
pretty
good
beer
the
best
from
cbc
that
i
have
had
thus
far
probably
o
overall
a
unique
porter
for
sure
the
fruitiness
works
well
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
rough
this
is
definitely
one
to
seek
out
if
you
dig
porters
the
cpj
very
sessionable
but
only
an
adequate
porter
with
the
exception
of
the
nose
which
is
amazing
delightfully
malty
definitely
preferred
this
over
the
stout
poured
dark
brown
with
a
white
head
malty
aroma
with
subtle
chocolate
tasted
malty
with
some
sweet
dark
fruits
in
the
background
and
a
bit
of
various
sugars
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
and
definitely
drinkable
pretty
basic
stuff
but
good
nonetheless
i
drank
this
porter
in
the
backyard
over
a
campfire
so
i
must
admit
it
went
straight
from
the
bottle
to
my
lips
overall
it
was
a
decent
porter
its
flavor
was
just
right
not
overbearing
and
not
tasteless
my
biggest
downer
on
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
i
would
love
for
it
to
have
been
creamery
that
said
this
is
a
porter
where
you
could
enjoy
a
sixer
if
the
occasion
called
for
it
overall
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
porter
sessionable
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
but
what
is
there
is
spot
on
and
tasty
i
would
definatly
drink
this
again
if
offered
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
again
however
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
divers
and
solid
beer
if
i
lived
in
ny
itd
probably
be
a
standby
ive
liked
most
of
the
stuff
ive
had
from
cooperstown
this
however
is
the
first
ive
taken
the
time
to
review
unique
labels
and
i
like
the
bottle
caps
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
one
that
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
drinkability
im
glad
i
discovered
cooperstown
when
i
moved
to
vestal
and
it
was
a
treat
to
visit
their
brewery
last
week
i
was
surprised
at
how
small
their
operation
was
but
a
lot
of
quality
and
old
school
flavor
go
into
making
their
beers
which
you
have
to
like
a
solid
and
extremely
drinkable
porter
and
with
the
prices
as
low
as
they
are
this
is
a
perfect
session
brew
for
the
fall
winter
seasons
d
easy
to
finish
and
a
style
i
have
really
started
to
get
into
this
is
something
id
pick
up
again
were
it
available
a
little
closer
to
home
d
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
its
fairly
light
in
taste
but
has
enough
flavor
to
be
interesting
i
could
easily
drink
2
or
3
of
these
d
a
nice
porter
rich
roasted
malts
great
bitterness
good
balance
notes
this
is
just
a
good
solid
porter
it
is
very
enjoyable
very
sessionable
and
easily
my
favorite
beer
from
the
cooperstown
brewery
this
porter
by
the
cooperstown
brewery
is
an
extremely
tasty
brew
the
characteristic
flavors
aromas
appearance
and
6
3
abv
all
compliment
each
other
for
nice
overall
presentation
the
drink
is
medium
in
body
with
mild
carbonation
quite
an
easy
drinker
thanks
to
lum
for
the
opportunity
smell
is
weak
and
almost
nonexistent
taste
is
good
with
dark
flavors
of
coffee
and
ripe
apples
and
other
dark
fruits
some
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
fairly
drinkable
for
a
dark
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
feint
ruby
highlights
produces
a
nice
tan
rocky
head
that
fades
slowly
roasted
malts
are
predominant
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
hops
fuggle
possibly
taste
is
great
with
some
decent
hop
bitterness
and
a
full
balanced
roasted
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thick
drinkability
is
fair
but
it
seems
you
could
get
quite
full
on
one
of
these
not
a
bad
porter
maybe
the
rest
of
the
sixer
will
round
itself
out
nicer
d
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
render
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
great
flavor
doesnt
hurt
either
pretty
drinkable
and
and
o
k
not
totally
exciting
notes
really
solid
porter
d
it
was
enjoyable
but
wore
on
me
the
further
i
got
into
drink
the
aftertaste
got
to
me
and
hurt
my
impression
of
the
brew
overall
this
is
a
solid
porter
it
doesnt
trump
anchor
or
edmund
fitzgerald
but
it
competes
well
i
would
recommend
but
dont
go
too
way
out
of
your
way
d
not
again
unless
i
have
need
to
expend
major
gass
benchwarmer
lives
up
to
its
name
im
a
fan
of
cooperstown
and
look
forward
to
next
season
when
this
one
may
get
a
lift
still
a
good
beer
this
one
fills
out
the
lineup
and
worthy
of
trying
when
one
just
wants
a
good
beer
or
to
while
away
the
hours
tossing
a
ball
around
with
friends
i
do
not
care
for
this
at
all
one
of
the
worst
porters
probably
the
worst
actually
ive
had
i
wont
revisit
mfd
a
little
thin
for
my
likings
but
went
down
well
worth
a
try
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
maroon
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
lots
of
roasted
coffee
with
a
bit
of
lemon
hops
it
tasted
like
bitter
coffee
and
burnt
chocolate
very
dark
and
dry
with
earthy
tones
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
lasting
coffee
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
was
was
one
of
the
better
cooperstown
brews
but
it
was
too
similar
to
all
their
other
beers
it
just
had
more
coffee
flavor
instead
of
copper
flavor
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
lighter
body
allows
for
greater
drinkability
d
not
bad
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
drinkable
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
thin
dark
brown
with
a
12
inch
light
tan
head
rings
of
lace
left
behind
after
each
sip
smells
of
toffee
caramel
and
toasted
malt
the
taste
was
watered
down
bitter
coffee
with
hints
of
toasted
malt
the
beer
was
thin
but
crisp
and
refreshing
too
bitter
for
my
liking
i
have
definitely
had
better
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
this
one
but
give
it
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
md
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
a
nice
fizziness
from
the
carbonation
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
the
slight
metal
flavor
is
a
turnoff
thanks
again
to
joe
for
the
chance
to
try
this
d
overall
a
great
porter
it
makes
me
a
little
angry
to
know
that
i
went
to
college
20
miles
from
here
and
never
visted
the
brewery
this
is
a
definite
staple
in
my
fridge
d
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
very
drinkable
drinkability
the
bitter
flavors
are
too
dominant
here
if
they
were
toned
down
and
the
roasted
coffee
was
given
the
spotlight
this
beer
would
improve
quite
a
bit
if
you
enjoy
this
beer
though
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
plenty
of
given
the
smoothness
and
low
abv
pours
a
dark
brown
with
basically
no
head
nose
is
like
roasted
qualities
flavor
is
roasted
and
just
an
old
coffee
bean
kinda
flavor
profile
feel
is
standard
just
feels
a
touch
light
lots
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
odd
porter
i
cant
really
put
it
up
against
others
i
have
had
as
far
as
similarities
go
the
body
seems
lighter
for
a
porter
overall
though
it
is
pretty
drinkable
i
would
just
never
go
back
to
it
served
in
a
nonic
as
with
all
my
brews
poured
out
coffee
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
light
tan
foam
the
aroma
was
everything
youd
expect
from
a
porter
roasted
coffee
the
taste
was
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
leaving
only
a
light
bitter
aftertaste
it
went
down
smooth
with
a
light
fizz
all
in
all
i
was
surprised
after
so
much
diacetyl
in
all
of
their
lighter
beers
i
wasnt
expecting
such
a
good
porter
the
feel
is
extremely
dry
with
a
bitter
afterbite
and
film
a
tad
milky
even
hefty
and
not
at
all
watery
this
is
a
smoothsipping
beer
a
nice
sturdy
porter
really
really
enjoyable
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
purplish
highlights
and
a
twofinger
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
is
a
little
malty
with
subtle
coffee
hints
the
taste
is
very
distinctive
of
a
porter
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
hints
and
large
amount
of
roasted
maltiness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
and
a
nice
one
to
reach
for
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
less
intense
thats
still
a
porter
this
beer
has
great
flavors
but
is
slightly
too
carbonated
it
almost
gets
a
little
fizzy
near
the
end
this
beauty
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
frothy
tan
head
leaving
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
quite
nice
roasted
malts
and
coffee
aromas
in
there
these
are
very
apparent
in
the
flavor
as
well
coffee
and
roasted
malts
going
down
nice
and
thick
very
tasty
really
smooth
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
what
a
porter
should
be
like
i
really
like
this
beer
benchwarmer
has
a
very
dark
appearance
more
so
than
most
of
the
other
porters
ive
tried
and
there
have
been
numerous
the
most
distinguishable
feature
i
notice
is
the
pungent
coffee
flavor
not
overpowering
but
very
prevalent
it
makes
this
beer
unique
and
the
reason
its
constantly
in
my
collection
it
does
seem
to
be
very
foamy
but
still
not
in
a
bad
way
it
adds
to
its
character
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
start
but
has
very
sweet
undertones
and
finishes
so
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
fall
day
i
will
definitely
be
partaking
in
more
12
oz
bottle
this
pours
a
ruby
hued
brown
color
with
a
3
finger
light
tan
head
over
top
that
falls
to
a
full
coat
over
top
clarity
is
very
good
and
there
is
little
to
no
carbonation
the
aroma
is
lightly
caramel
sweet
and
moderately
nutty
but
overrun
with
diacetyl
butteryness
that
borders
on
offensive
to
me
i
recall
that
they
use
ringwood
years
here
so
this
is
not
a
big
surprise
the
flavor
is
a
little
better
there
is
a
solid
roasted
character
that
moves
to
a
more
mild
sweet
caramel
and
finishes
with
a
mild
earthy
hop
and
bitter
this
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
i
am
really
not
able
to
move
past
the
aroma
on
this
one
it
just
rubs
me
wrong
to
have
that
much
diacetly
it
is
nice
that
the
roast
malt
helps
to
cover
this
in
the
flavor
but
it
doesnt
save
this
one
for
me
i
liked
this
one
probably
one
of
the
better
cooperstown
brews
its
simple
and
it
gets
the
style
right
no
complaints
here
and
one
id
be
happy
to
have
again
a
dark
root
beer
color
with
a
modest
and
fizzy
head
but
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
nutty
sweet
coffee
blend
that
is
pretty
alluring
the
taste
brings
out
charcoal
and
chocolate
but
has
a
strong
sour
mash
background
it
is
fairly
acqueous
and
very
fizzy
but
drinkable
enough
the
sour
quality
gets
kind
of
prominent
during
the
first
half
but
mellows
by
the
second
half
so
it
grows
on
you
as
it
warms
and
sits
a
little
bit
i
liked
it
and
would
definitely
welcome
this
at
future
sittings
pretty
refreshing
for
a
porter
too
after
the
pour
and
the
sniff
test
i
was
all
set
for
a
full
rich
malty
buttery
porter
what
i
got
was
something
less
than
that
but
im
not
too
disappointed
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
else
cooperstown
brings
to
the
plate
bigger
wood
i
hope
thanks
beertruth
drinkable
but
i
would
not
sit
down
for
a
long
session
just
with
the
benchwarmer
hadnt
had
this
brew
in
a
long
time
and
for
some
reason
i
was
just
in
one
of
those
porter
moods
poured
into
an
old
rasputin
mini
pint
glass
a
a
dark
brown
with
shreds
of
light
pulling
through
a
nice
white
head
sat
on
top
with
good
retention
sort
of
musty
in
the
smell
but
with
a
little
spin
some
fruit
aromas
came
through
roasted
apples
come
to
mind
taste
had
a
lot
of
coffee
molasses
going
on
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
was
roasty
with
charred
smoke
mouthfeel
was
probably
my
favorite
part
of
this
brew
in
that
it
is
pretty
well
carbonated
it
gives
the
beer
a
bitter
ending
while
also
giving
it
a
crisp
and
refreshing
personality
i
will
have
no
problems
polishing
off
the
six
pack
of
this
beer
it
is
nice
to
see
a
porter
with
some
character
most
of
the
examples
i
have
had
lately
have
been
a
bit
on
the
boring
side
now
if
only
i
could
find
some
of
their
stout
by
the
way
i
guess
this
is
my
100th
review
thanks
ba
for
changing
the
way
i
taste
things
and
for
vastly
increasing
my
understanding
of
all
things
brewed
long
live
yeast
cultures
solid
and
warming
a
nice
porter
d
im
very
glad
i
hid
this
one
for
a
few
months
i
was
looking
for
a
good
nightcap
and
it
definitely
fit
this
is
one
that
i
wouldnt
have
appreciated
anywhere
near
as
much
if
i
had
it
last
year
or
even
a
few
months
ago
id
definitely
include
this
in
a
style
sampling
a
serviceable
porter
black
with
tons
of
foam
that
was
a
delight
on
the
palate
nearly
burnt
coffee
ground
tarish
aroma
sounds
worse
than
it
was
average
taste
with
significant
burnt
coffee
bitter
sediment
perhaps
as
it
approached
march
expiration
sean
initially
the
clarity
and
lighter
than
expected
body
threw
me
off
but
this
is
a
solid
example
of
an
english
porter
this
could
easily
be
used
as
a
session
beer
d
this
is
a
pretty
fine
beer
not
of
the
watery
porter
variety
nice
balanced
flavors
and
a
good
bitterness
to
round
it
out
ill
be
going
back
to
this
one
for
sure
my
new
favorite
from
this
place
well
done
an
exceptional
porter
particularly
on
the
taste
another
solid
offering
from
a
too
often
overlooked
brewery
drinkability
my
last
review
crowned
back
yard
ipa
as
the
best
from
cbc
this
beer
takes
that
title
hands
down
the
flavors
are
full
and
unambiguous
giving
the
beer
a
real
body
this
is
hereby

d
good

on
this
offering
from
cooperstown
i
like
this
porter
as
its
quite
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
good
abv
definately
a
recommended
one
if
you
can
find
it
this
pours
a
black
ruby
with
a
huge
head
there
is
a
ton
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
the
smell
is
very
strong
with
dark
fruitcoffee
and
chocolate
aromas
the
taste
is
a
bit
thin
with
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
flavors
a
pretty
good
porter
with
the
chocolate
comming
out
as
it
warms
up
more
the
mf
is
a
little
too
light
for
my
tastebut
this
is
a
top
quality
beer
that
should
not
be
missed
i
checked
the
website
minutes
later
and
they
say
they
use
ringwood
yeast
that
makes
some
sense
as
that
yeast
is
pretty
aggressive
but
this
thing
feels
and
tastes
so
belgian
in
origin
i
wonder
if
they
didnt
substitute
a
belgian
yeast
for
a
batch
poured
a
deep
with
a
frothy
cratered
tan
head
with
just
great
lasting
power
it
just
sits
thee
on
top
with
no
declinearomas
are
somewhat
faint
i
picked
up
some
bitter
chocolate
and
a
little
earth
but
it
doesnt
really
jump
out
at
ya
wow
a
nice
airycreamy
mouthfeel
marshmellowlike
you
could
say
very
nice
going
downa
well
rounded
porter
subtle
in
many
ways
starts
out
with
notes
of
unsweetened
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
buter
finishing
quite
dry
eand
earthy
with
underlying
woodiness
not
overly
complex
but
there
are
some
nice
flavors
going
on
and
the
before
mentioned
mouthfeel
makes
it
ever
so
drinkablea
winner
this
is
a
really
a
good
porter
dark
and
deep
this
beer
having
tasted
it
at
the
bewery
has
a
great
look
it
also
tastes
and
smells
wonderful
a
burnt
aroma
is
present
but
not
overpowering
this
is
a
nice
and
smooth
porter
bitterness
is
tamed
and
combined
with
some
sweetness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
texture
is
also
good
without
being
too
heavy
its
a
nice
all
around
porter
with
little
flaw
drinkability
good
for
a
porter
looks
and
smells
excellent
tastes
really
good
but
the
mouthfeel
could
stand
improvement
this
beer
might
as
well
be
called
darkchocolate
porter
it
is
very
tasty
porter
and
one
of
the
biggest
beers
cooperstown
brewing
company
makes
it
pours
a
mahogony
with
a
lot
of
lace
remaining
as
i
drink
it
it
is
slightly
carbonated
the
smell
is
all
dark
chocolate
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
little
bit
of
roastiness
and
bitterness
from
the
mild
hops
it
is
one
of
the
better
american
porters
i
have
tried
and
with
the
essense
of
dark
chocolate
shining
through
very
nicely
definitely
one
of
the
better
cooperstown
beers
i
have
tried
a
solid
porter
that
is
rather
easy
to
drink
and
just
smells
great
this
doesnt
just
warm
the
bench
it
warms
your
stomach
with
the
abv
but
it
is
tasty
recomended
have
had
this
brew
a
number
of
times
and
am
surprised
that
i
had
not
written
a
review
on
it
before
brew
pours
to
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
that
has
a
nice
amount
of
retention
leaving
lacing
through
out
the
aromas
are
very
enticing
slight
smokiness
is
noticeable
along
with
toastedslight
roast
scent
seems
like
a
lots
of
dark
malt
the
taste
is
top
notch
had
a
dominant
chocolate
and
coffee
like
taste
that
has
some
sweet
characteristics
slight
hop
presence
at
the
tail
end
compliments
and
rounds
out
the
offering
only
giving
is
a
good
for
drinkability
due
to
the
abv
even
though
i
feel
i
could
have
many
of
them
just
might
not
have
a
good
morning
it
is
a
favorite
of
mine
also
like
the
fact
that
it
is
a
local
brew
drinkability
easily
quaffable
and
this
can
be
a
decent
session
beer
as
the
flavor
is
mild
and
well
balanced
this
was
probably
the
mostovercarbonated
beer
ive
ever
consumed
when
i
tried
to
pour
it
completely
overwelmed
the
side
of
the
glass
and
took
severl
pours
to
empty
the
bottle
it
appeared
as
a
deep
brown
liquid
with
reddish
highlights
smell
was
roasty
caramelly
coffeelike
taste
followed
through
nice
a
nice
chocolate
roasted
malt
taste
finish
was
creamy
with
a
trace
of
dryness
would
have
been
better
if
the
pour
was
easier
overall
a
great
beer
my
favorite
porter
as
i
said
before
i
think
the
extra
carbonation
might
be
one
of
the
factors
that
attracts
me
to
this
one
over
other
porters
the
taste
is
definately
there
but
never
overwhelming
i
can
put
these
back
one
after
another
and
enjoy
every
single
one
drink
this
beer
i
liked
it
better
than
their
stout
nice
dark
brown
color
with
lots
of
head
and
lacing
rich
full
porter
flavor
roasted
with
just
a
bit
of
a
bite
had
a
little
more
carbonation
than
other
porters
ive
tried
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
have
the
chance
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
quite
the
head
the
head
appears
tans
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
also
laces
the
glass
with
a
nice
ring
of
foam
the
taste
is
one
of
coffee
and
chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
burt
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
has
a
bite
to
it
this
beer
has
more
carbonation
than
i
would
expect
form
a
porter
it
is
average
thats
all
i
can
say
an
interesting
brew
from
cooperstown
there
are
other
versions
id
rather
have
but
this
one
is
quite
pleasant
one
of
my
favorites
from
cooperstown
thus
far
quite
drinkable
excellent
session
brew
it
has
been
quite
some
time
since
i
have
had
a
benchwarmer
i
do
not
recall
it
being
this
good
i
will
have
to
add
this
to
my
regular
selection
pours
a
dark
brown
nearly

hues
theres
a

head

the
smell

a
notable
fruit
qualitynot
at
all
expected
also
in
the
aroma
are
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
something
very
much
like
a
sugary
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
very
mild
especially
considering
the
smell
theres
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
just
a
little
sweetness
and
a
slight
roasted
graininess
peppery
hop
finish
average
carbonation
and
medium
body
fairly
quaffable
and
interesting
but
lackluster
a
deep
dark
brown
with
mahogony
highlights
has
a
good
foamy
beige
head
there
is
some
chocolate
and
butterscotch
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
has
hints
of
chocolate
and
licorice
with
a
strong
backbone
of
bitter
coffee
the
mouth
feel
was
a
little
off
from
the
thickness
i
expected
but
i
liked
the
bitterness
character
on
the
the
finish
nice
and
dry
pours
a
deep
ruddy
brown
seems
like
some
sediment

the

agressive

just

for
personally
notes
a
good
one
to

up
during

a

cheers
overall
a
very
nice
traditional

i
miss
i
saw
more
of
this
as
i
feel
its
one
of
gearys
better
efforts
definitely
worth
picking
up
o
would
like
more
body
and
less
bitter
for
this
beer
to
go
into
the
outstanding
range
but
it
is
knocking
on
the
door
i
dont
like
gearys
very
much
but
this
porter
is
definitely
the
best
thing
out
of
their
winter
variety
pack
i
feel
like
i
needed
to
rate
this
beer
because
i
am
not
much
of
a
porter
fan
in
general
tending
to
stick
to
ipas
and
stouts
but
this
one
was
nicely
smooth
and
tasted
more
like
vanilla
than
a
typical
porter
closer
to
a
stout
it
seemed
but
more
bitter
however
rather
than
a
typical
porter
which
tends
to
have
the
bitter
and
almost
dry
taste
for
a
darker
beer
this
one
had
a
very
tasty
sweet
and
almost
refreshing
taste
and
mouthfeel
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
nice
if
you
want
a
dark
beer
that
wont
fill
you
up
to
quickly
goes
nicely
with
barbecued
steak
the
taste
has
hints
of
dark
malts
and
coffee
but
there
is
am
kind
of
buttery
character
and
and
bland
aftertaste
that
lingers
i
chalk
that
up
to
low
bitterness
but
it
just
seems
to
be
missing
something
the
appearance
is
what
youd
expect
wellcarbonated
and
decent
lacing
great
roasted
smell
the
taste
has
got
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
wrapped
in
with
the
malt
a
great
dry
example
of
the
style
and
also
a
really
excellent
example
of
a
dark
beer
not
loaded
with
calories
i
was
going
to
dock
more
points
in
the
mouthfeel
department
for
being
maybe
too
mild
but
as
im
drinking
it
im
realizing
a
this
is
the
first
porter
i
could
drink
several
of
and
b
this
is
gearys
i
really
really
dig
this
company
they
blend
tradition
and
craftsmanship
in
a
way
i
thoroughly
respect
overall
i
like
the
dryness
and
drinkability
of
this
porter
i
feel
like
this
would
make
a
great

as
id
expect
from
a
london
porter
nor
is
the
body
as
rich
frankly
i
thought
this
porter
was
kind
of
thin
good
just
not
really
a
londoner
to
me
i
think
i
might
retry
this
one
down
the
road
the
flavors
that
were
there
were
decent
but
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
one
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
because
it
was
packed
with
lots
of
flavors
while
being
very
easy
to
drink
and
rather
lightbodied
i
could
easily
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
dry
astringent
feel
ashy
bitter
roast
mellow
roasted
malt
lending
chocolate
and
unsweetened
dark
chocolate
flavors
body
is
a
little
light
and
watery
but
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
somewhat
overall
a
good
roasty
porter
though
founders
porter
is
still
superior
by
far
thanks
bendurgin
for
the
opportunity
like
the
aroma
the
taste
was
a
little
light
ok
not
great
i
know
its
hard
with
an
abv
that
low
but
other
breweries
have
been
able
to
do
it
o
decent
for
the
style
good
for
me
poured
a
blackish
body
with
slow
dying
onefinger
brownish
head
a
good
mix
of
roasted
dry
even
coffee
malts
and
for
sweetness
something
like
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
smooth
slightly
creamy
while
also
a
little
chewey
thanks
to
some
thick
breadiness
a
sturdy
backbone
of
roasted
and
coffee
malt
balance
with
the
sweetness
of
caramel
and
chocolate
and
i
think
vanilla
espresso
textbook
porter
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
complements
itself
with
a
great
dry
finish
taht
keeps
me
wanting
more
o
this
is
a
solid
english
porter
that
has
full
flavor
despite
the
low
abv
easy
to
drink
and
goes
great
on
a
rainy
day
like
today
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
nice
flavor
for
behing
so
low
in
abv
which
i
applaud
could
be
a
nice
darker
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
this
is
such
a
good
porter
worlds
different
from
the
smooth
porters
and
hoppy
porters
i
usually
go
for
but
this
drinks
wonderfully
real
nice
porter
i
love
them
english
style
o
i
drank
this
blind
and
i
think
it
is
an
english
porter
not
generally
a
fan
of
them
as
i
like
my
porters
to
be
roasty
and
full
of
darker
flavors
not
really
light
and
fruity
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
it
fits
but
not
my
taste
found
a
six
of
bottles
today
at
brooklyn
beer
soda
cracked
one
open
way
over
carbonated
have
been
nursing
this
for
over
an
hour
now
ever
time
i
try
to
drink
it
just
suds
up
i
hope
the
other
bottles
are
better
poured
into
pint
glass
from
12
oz
bottle
on
hot
day
at
sugarloaf
a
is
a
rich
hearty
dark
ale
head
is
nice
w
little
interlacing
s
is
quite
distracting
smelling
of
bitter
molasses
not
inviting
t
is
really
nice
and
refreshing
almost
a
taste
of
sassafrass
which
i
enjoy
well
balanced
m
is
smooth
and
nice
and
light
o
it
is
a
warm
friendly
good
porter
not
syrupy
and
good
for
all
seasons
whats
up
wit
the
aroma
o
a
well
crafted
porter
true
to
style
id
definitely
drink
another
one
gearys
has
dissapointed
again
this
is
a
thin
version
of
a
porter
the
appearance
is
about
right
but
without
any
highlights
the
aroma
is
on
the
underside
for
the
style
but
ok
the
taste
really
lacking
there
is
little
to
say
about
the
character
of
the
brew
because
it
doesnt
have
any
mouth
is
thin
for
the
style
and
overall
it
is
just
not
on
par
with
the
dozens
of
porters
on
my
list
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
porter
fan
but
this
is
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
ill
have
another
just
to
be
sure
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
tiny
head
no
retention
or
lacing
aroma
is
nice
theres
a
full
roastiness
with
some
baking
chocolate
the
taste
is
also
pretty
good
this
is
a
fullon
very
roasty
bordering
on
burnt
porter
with
just
hints
of
chocolate
and
nuttiness
to
help
it
along
dont
like
roasted
malts
stay
away
here
because
theyre
running
the
joint
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
mediumbodied
with
a
fairly
high
carbonation
for
the
style
and
the
drinkability
is
also
pretty
good
overall
a
solid
beer
even
if
its
not
a
standout
taste
is
fairly
one
note
since
the
roasted
malt
dominates
the
flavor
finishes
very
dry
and
with
a
dark
chocolate
like
bitterness
carbonation
is
low
but
more
than
enough
can
feel
a
bit
thin
at
times
has
a
nice
mouth
not
abrasive
and
not
a
hoppy
bitter
end
a
very
good
english
porter
this
beer
was
black
like
a
porter
should
be
the
beer
had
a
little
bit
of
a
saltiness
to
it
not
really
sure
if
this
beer
was
supposed
to
be
smoked
or
not
im
getting
the
idea
that
they
tried
smoking
the
malts
or
something
here
its
a
drinkable
brew
but
its
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
i
should
revisit
this
sometime
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
good
smooth
finish
as
it
goes
down
this
is
a
low
alcohol
beer
that
is
great
for
having
a
few
without
the
worry
of
it
growing
on
you
d
actually
this
one
is
ranking
kinda
high
here
as
well
first
the
whole
burnt
roasted
bomb
taste
dissipates
rather
nicely
has
your
palate
gets
adjusted
to
whats
attacking
it
at
4
2
i
think
geary
is
brewing
a
wonderful
take
on
a
style
that
most
craft
breweries
look
over
time
and
time
again
a
simple
flavorful
low
abv
beer
that
packs
flavor
m
d
too
light
in
body
too
weak
in
flavor
and
even
with
a
nonpersistent
head
too
carbonated
pass
drinkability
i
have
been
very
pleased
with
this
beer
great
classic
porter
flavors
which
seem
pretty
traditional
and
true
to
the
style
id
have
to
say
the
drinkability
is
high
on
account
of
this
being
a
very
tasty
beer
and
a
great
paper
writing
accomplice
this
brew
showed
up
at
my
door
courtesy
of
botmc
cool
bottle
looks
like
a
mini
cooper
without
wheels
lets
give
it
a
whirl
uncapping
the
mini
i
get
a
nice
whiff
of
chocolates
and
roasted
malts
pouring
into
a
pint
this
brew
is
an
opaque
jet
black
with
a
nice
micro
bubble
foamy
tan
head
on
first
taste
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
thin
the
flavor
starts
in
after
the
initial
wateriness
and
has
a
flat
bitterness
combined
with
a
chaulky
roasted
malt
flavor
all
in
all
tasty
but
quite
thin
and
seriously
lacking
in
body
with
its
low
abv
and
it
not
be
at
all
offensive
in
any
way
this
would
make
a
great
session
brew
nothing
wrong
with
a
dark
one
either
very
dark
with
translucent
chestnut
edges
the
foam
was
a
bit
coarse
and
most
of
it
fell
quickly
but
some
fine
bubbles
remained
and
formed
a
thick
collar
that
lasted
aromas
of
molasses
caramel
licorice
dry
cocoa
a
bit
phenolic
from
the
dark
malts
the
texture
was
a
bit
rough
due
to
the
coarse
carbonation
and
light
body
drying
astringency
from
the
dark
grains
low
bitterness
with
less
sweetness
than
i
expected
biscuit
and
cocoa
with
a
hint
of
licorice
not
as
much
caramel
as
in
the
aroma
seems
a
bit
thin
on
malt
my
overall
impression
was
that
it
was
alright
but
a
fell
a
bit
short
of
being
great
this
was
pleasant
to
drink
and
coupled
well
with
the
buffalo
chicken
sandwich
i
ordered
it
is
a
complex
layering
of
smells
and
flavors
some
of
which
blend
perfectly
other
times
you
ponder
what
is
that
d
a
low
abv
flavorful
porter
that
could
use
to
be
5
2
and
much
heftiness
at
great
gain
with
a
bigger
maltload
still
all
in
all
a
really
good
beer
that
works
well
with
the
gearys
signature
ringwood
yeast
drinkability
is
good
at
dba
nyc
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
thin
khaki
head
little
retention
yet
good
lacing
little
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
nuts
maple
syrup
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
was
a
perfect
blend
of
the
above
finishing
on
a
semidry
roasted
coffee
note
which
lingered
afterwards
very
flavorful
fullbodied
with
more
carbonation
than
expected
this
is
a
great
session
porter
not
a
great
summer
beer
be
definitely
will
find
room
in
the
fridge
for
it
this
fall
drinkability
id
give
it
a
higher
score
if
i
liked
the
flavor
profile
more
nice
roasty
porter
with
good
chocolate
notes
medium
light
body
slides
down
almost
like
a
brown
ale
but
has
the
flavor
a
porter
enjoyable
low
abv
i
could
see
kicking
back
many
of
these
while
shooting
some
pool
with
the
boys
i
really
like
the
chocolate
notes
to
this
and
how
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
it
is
nice
workman
like
porter
overall
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
relatively
low
abv
a
solid
flavor
and
aroma
and
just
a
few
minor
slipups
here
and
there
make
this
a
fairly
sessionable
english
porter
if
youre
into
that
cheers
id
like
it
better
without
the
acidity
but
appreciated
the
glimpse
in
the
history
of
the
style
like
a
time
capsule
going
back
when
the
actual
bartender
would
mix
soured
beer
with
the
new
stuff
neat
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
small
tan
head
good
aromahas
a
mild
caramel
somewhat
slight
espresso
tinge
to
it
nice
roasted
flavormild
chocolate
tinge
roasted
grain
bitterness
finish
is
quite
dry
decent
body
for
the
lower
abvi
was
afraid
of
it
being
too
thin
overall
a
good
uk
porter
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
decent
depth
and
complexity
overall
a
nice
english
porter
hv
d
good
overall
drinkability
for
this
porter
it
is
not
off
balance
or
off
flavored
in
any
areas
but
not
the
best
porter
i
have
ever
had
very
solid
though
and
with
low
alcohol
easy
to
sit
down
to
a
few
of
these
the
taste
for
the
most
part
follows
the
path
taken
by
the
nose
the
beer
is
a
bit
watery
and
thin
not
a
warming
type
porter
but
it
is
tasty
the
beer
has
the
usual
suspects
one
would
expect
from
the
style
but
there
is
an
english
interpretation
to
this
beer
with
a
toffeeish
flavor
and
what
i
think
is
a
bit
of
diacetyl
buttery
flavors
the
yeast
strain
may
not
have
been
the
most
complementary
given
what
the
brewery
was
aiming
at
there
is
just
a
touch
of
drying
cocoa
in
the
finish
but
it
is
hidden
behind
the
toffee
and
everything
else
happening
here
this
is
a
tasty
brew
i
like
it
but
it
is
not
a
hearty
porter
by
any
means
just
approach
it
for
what
it
is
yes
youll
find
plenty
to
like
but
you
may
find
yourself
wanting
it
to
be
just
a
bit
more
porterish
this
is
no
tadcaster
porter
but
is
still
a
nice
smooth
lowabv
beer
worth
a
six
this
beer
pours
a
nearly
opaque
brownishblack
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
light
tan
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
graham
cracker
and
gearys
yeast
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
it
is
quite
yeasty
for
a
porter
but
good
nonetheless
actually
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
the
yeast
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
the
feel
is
more
fuller
bodied
than
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
4
2
abv
and
i
really
like
that
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
that
i
could
easily
session
regularly
dvery
nice
and
drinkable
beer
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
great
representation
of
the
style
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
decent
representation
of
the
style
and
with
this
abv
is
one
to
sit
with
for
an
evening
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
flavor
and
a
session
worthy
4

abv
this
is
two
brews
in
a
row
from
gearys
that
i
have
been
very
impressed
with
how
have
i
not
heard
of
this
brewery
until
now
thanks
again
gritty
has
a
nice
dry
finish
but
didnt
have
the
bite
i
would
have
anticipated
overall
a
real
nice
representation
of
the
style
and
a
real
good
value
pours
nice
deep
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
garnet
highlights
held
to
the
light
the
thin
head
is
gone
quickly
and
laceing
is
minimal
the
aroma
is
nice
toffee
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
and
tobacco
in
the
finish
the
taste
needs
work
rather
then
malty
sweetness
i
get
hop
dryness
and
an
irony
finish
you
can
definately
feel
the
malty
smoothness
across
the
tounge
and
several
of
these
could
be
consumed
without
issue
pours
a
cloudy
and
opaque
dark
brown
some
reddish
highlights
massive
tan
head
forms
chunky
head
big
layer
and
ring
lots
of
chunks
stick

the

smell
is
okay
dry

roasty

and
dark

some
chocolate
very
sweet

sugary

is
dry

toasty
pretty
watery
dry
biscuit

some
coffee
grinds

and
some
dark
fruit
alright
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
aroma
isnt
so
good
but
the
flavor
is
good
if
a
little
weak
thanks
russ
this
may
be
the
best
british
porter
brewed
in
america
if
you
like
the
nonbastardized
true
style
i
happen
to
like
big
crazy
hopped
out
maltbombed
who
the
hell
knows
anything
goes
american
porters
and
stouts
too
but
whatever
and
want
it
fresh
pick
this
up
if
you
have
had
british
porter
and
know
what
to
expect
youll
like
this
smaller
than
fullers
but
no
slouch
by
any
means
it
has
a
malty
nutty
flavor
and
a
rich
mouth
feel
very
pleasing
to
drink
there
is
very
little
hopiness
in
the
aroma
and
combined
with
the
nutty
flavor
this
porter
is
a
warming
drink
good
for
cool
weather
mouthfeel
is
light
very
smooth
and
with
light
carbonation
as
far
as
drinkability
id
pour
another
drinkability
a
very
well
balanced
porter
that
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
this
is
tasty
and
easily
sessionable
pitch
black
colored
beer
with
a
rich
creamy
head
aroma
is
a
little
coffee
and
a
little
chocolate
taste
is
vert
watery
and
weak
chocolatecoffee
and
there
is
some
kind
of
metallic
taste
overall
to
me
very
bland
and
boring
this
is
my
first
and
last
and
i
really
wouldnt
recommend
for
anyone
to
waste
money
on
this
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
sessionable
porter
recommended
im
impressed
by
how
flavorful
this
one
is
with
such
a
low
abv
pretty
good
beer
id
say
d
a
nice
american
take
on
an
english
porter
i
think
the
body
needs
to
be
about
10
fuller
but
otherwise
not
much
to
complain
about
here
drinkability
gearys
hit
a
homerun
with
this
one
for
such
a
low
abv
i
cant
believe
how
much
flavor
and
body
this
porter
has
its
almost
like
one
big
conglomerate
of
darker
flavors
packed
into
one
small
easy
to
drink
brew
they
pulled
off
the
coffee
elements
perfectly
roasty
and
easy
to
drink
a
splendid
job
from
one
of
the
better
brewers
out
of
maine
the
most
flavorful
loweralcohol
dark
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
747412
3
45
the
taste
is
light
in
body
zesty
less
light
and
lively
than
nethergate
old
growler
but
more
so
than
many
with
a
clean
flavour
of
toasted
dark
bread
light
roastiness
a
sweet
fruitiness
folowed
by
drier
toasty
finish
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
black
pepper
its
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
a
little
more
watery
than
i
expected
still
outstanding
drinkability
a
great
one
to
session
in
colder
weather
went
great
with
breakfast
for
dinner
which
is
fast
becoming
a
staple
with
2
little
kids
and
both
parents
working
theres
a
more
carbonation
in
this
than
expected
which
also
shocks
me
as
the
head
is
no
where
to
be
seen
this
cleanses
the
palate
and
makes
this
seem
much
lighter
than
it
really
is
overall
a
very
drinkable
porter
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
pleasant
but
not
complex
taste
is
quite
similar
dry
at
the
end
nice
amount
of
flavor
for
such
a
low
alcohol
beer
d
low
abv
and
smooth
texture
lend
to
a
rich
flavored
session
porter
d
thanks
to
great
trader
joepais
for
the
tasty
extra
the
german
chocolate
and
coffee
bean
combined
with
the
slight
hop
bitterness
to
make
a
uniquely
blended
porter
big
caramel
malts
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
was
mediumfull
and
smooth
overall
a
good
american
porter
but
im
not
sure
where
the
london
part
comes
in
single
12
oz
from
whole
foods
cary
rich
roasty
bitterness
coffee
cocoa
and
roasty
malt
in
the
finish
rich
and
multidimensional
ive
had
way
to
many
porters
recently
that
were
just
kinda
boring
and
cookie
cutter
this
one
holds
true
the
style
while
being
very
tasty
and
unique
a
great
finishing
beer
for
the
night
pours
an
espresso
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
aromas
of
roasted
malt
and
molasses
are
prevalent
up
front
flavors
of
oatmeal
coffee
chocolate
finishing
with
pleasant
hoppiness
well
balanced
mild
carbonation
coats
the
mouth
easy
drinking
for
a
porter
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
body
is
more
of
mid
feel
and
a
light
carbonation
spot
on
with
a
more
london
style
overall
there
are
some
great
aspects
and
there
are
some
off
aspects
of
this
beer
one
thing
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
it
created
a
lot
of
discussion
on
style
with
both
porter
and
london
porter
i
think
i
will
leave
it
at
that
this
is
a
very
dark
rosey
brown
with
a
fairly
scant
tan
head
and
mediocre
lacing
i
note
a
chocolate
prune
and
charcoal
aroma
it
delivers
a
solid
charcoal
flavor
with
aqueous
feel
light
on
the
carbonation
but
lots
of
smoke
flavor
a
bit
dry
easy
drinking
with
a
light
grain
background
generally
a
pleasant
surprise
and
very
much
recommended
d
not
bad
at
all
for
a
session
porter
nothing
will
wow
you
flavorwise
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
gives
you
that
dark
beer
character
flavorwise
in
something
thats
low
abv
and
easy
to
drink
pours
opaque
head
is
a
bit
of
a
darker
tan
huge
also
because
i
poured
very
firmly
nose
is
basically
like
dusty
chocolate
not
very
impressive
flavor
is
bordering
on
bland
not
much
interesting
going
on
here
sure
it
has
a
nice
steady
body
but
no
real
strong
characteristics
that
stand
out
above
the
malt
character
feel
is
a
bit
thin
on
the
liquid
with
a
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
very
smooth
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
but
i
just
have
to
wonder
if
this
was
the
freshest
bottle
available
maybe
i
will
try
again
one
day
overall
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
due
to
its
mellow
nature
it
has
a
good
porter
taste
with
no
unpleasant
subflavors
and
is
very
wellbalanced
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
highly
recommended
this
is
an
easytodrink
porter
while
the
body
is
significant
distraction
the
flavor
is
very
good
this
beer
poured
blackish
brown
with
a
singlefinger
tan
head
the
smell
is
very
pleasant
with
a
large
amount
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
starts
off
with
the
strong
malty
coffee
taste
to
some
middling
sweetness
and
just
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
bite
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
although
there
was
a
little
bit
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
this
is
extremely
drinkable
for
a
porter
and
i
could
imagine
putting
away
quite
i
will
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
in
the
future
d
when
i
think
of
a
porter
this
is
what
comes
to
mind
lighter
in
body
but
still
assertive
in
malt
flavor
thats
what
this
beer
displays
as
well
as
a
spoton
carbonation
that
is
the
quintessential
englishstyle
porter
balance
and
flavor
are
great
and
this
is
my
idea
of
a
solid
sessionable
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
a
while
especially
if
you
want
a
dark
but
mild
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
them
but
i
would
normally
go
for
something
with
more
of
a
kick
to
it
its
still
a
very
drinkable
porter
that
i
wouldnt
discount
im
really
impressed
with
the
drinkability
of
gearys
ales
lately
overall
very
good
the
best
ive
had
from
gearys
overall
a
very
tasty
porter
and
nice
representation
of
the
style
a
tame

english
porter
good
enough
to
toss
back
a
couple
but
nothing
exciting
about
this
offering
12oz

a
very
dark
ruby
brown
virtually
no
head
and
no
carbonation
aroma
is
of
molasses
with
a
hint
of
electronics
first
time
is
actually
a
bit
sparkly
which
is
surprising
given
the
lack
of
carbonation
ah
now
that
i
look
closer
from
the
top
i
do
see
several
rivers
of
small
bubbles
the
malt
and
molasses
taste
isnt
particularly
strong
at
first
taste
but
it
does
give
way
to
a
decent
smoky
aftertaste
overall
the
body
is
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
the
texture
opens
with
an
expected
creaminess
and
finishes
with
a
clean
feel
do
to
the
carbonation
this
english
porter
is
not
as
heavy
as
a
lot
of
similar
brews
which
adds
to
the
high
drinkability
but
in
contrast
the
amount
of
flavor
suffers
somewhat
a
solid
beer
nontheless
pours
a
nice
dark
brownblack
which
is
on
style
smell
is
of
a
slight
burnt
malt
with
some
chocolate
notes
the
taste
is
very
good
on
style
the
chocolate
malt
is
definitely
there
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
especially
when

middle

porter
from
a

six
at

joes
in
tallahassee
it
doesnt
meet
my
idea
of
what
a
good
porter
should
be
i
suppose
this
might
work
as
a
porter
for
people
who
dont
like
porters
yet
its
too
bitter
for
the
newcastle
crowd
not
sayin
much
just
sayin
im
at
a
loss
as
to
what
sort
of
beer
drinker
this
is
meant
for
you
know
its
easy
to
lose
sight
of
a
good
porter
when
youre
primarily
chasing
the
biggest
hoppiest
beers
around
i
would
recommend
this
rjt
well
for
a
buck
a
bottle
all
of
the
trader
joes
beers
have
been
just
fine
tho
some
better
than
others
this
isnt
one
of
the
better
of
the
15
different
beers
i
got
from
trader
joes
but
what
the
hey
im
going
to
finish
it
so
thats
not
bad
the
taste
has
a
quick
burst
of
sweet
malts
which
are
followed
nearly
immediately
by
a
modest
hop
bite
the
ends
on
the
dry
side
not
an
extraordinary
porter
but
one
that
i
found
to
be
drinkable
for
a
dollar
a
bottle
though
it
might
very
well
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
its
great
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
strong
cup
of
black
coffee
with
no
sugar
very
smooth
and
delectable
right
balance
of
dark
malt
goodness
with
an
ohso
subtle

gave

this
over

with
the

flavors
being
predominantsome
dark
roast
and
mild
earthiness
to
cut
off
the
sweetness
just
enough
in
the
finish
not
bad
but
the
sweetness
and
fizzy
feel
detracts
from
it
bottom
line
as
many
others
have
reviewed
this
is
a
very
average
porter
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
however
there
are
many
other
porters
that
i
would
recommend
over
this
one
if
you
do
not
have
loyalties
to
a
particular
porter
then
give
kennebunkport
a
try
you
might
like
it
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
very
drinkable
porter
with
enough
carbonation
to
tingle
the
whole
tongue
and
and
a
bitterness
that
sustains
the
full
depth
of
the
swallow
the
kbc
porter
mouth
feel
is
easy
to
drink
after
day
at
work
without
an
overwhelming
alcohol
content
making
a
relaxing
sensation
that
is
very
satisfying
but
not
overwhelming
overall
for
the
price
purchased
at
trader
joes
make
it
a
value
for
those
who
want
a
dark
beer
to
relax
to
after
a
hard
day
at
work
although
not
a
stellar
porter
is
very
easy
to
enjoy
without
the
heavy
alcohol
content
and
sweetness
that
are
found
in
others
of
this
style
poured
into
a
maudite

a

dark

with
reddish
tones
two

light
brown
head
with

aroma
of
dark
roasted

element

medium
bodied
thin
for
a
porter
thin

pleasant

forgetable

its
mission
as
a
cheap
drinkable
porter
the
verdict
average
there
are
much
better
porters
out
there
but
theres
nothing
to
really
complain
about
not
a
bad
brew
but
the
acrid
character
is
offputting
a
touch
on
the
bittercharred
side
good
for
the
price
but
nothing
too
special
flavorwise
overall
nice
porter
its
a
nice
addition
to
the

lineup
and
a
hell
of
a
deal
for
the

asking
price
the
body
was
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
of
average
for
the
style
drinkability
was
good
the
beer
went
down
smoothly
and
easily
and
it
wouldnt
be
a
chore
to
have
a
couple
of
these
overall
a
solid
decent
brew
that
at
its
price
makes
it
a
good
value
to
stick
in
the
fridge
for
when
your
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
easy
drinking
porter

burnt
coffee
and
some
metallic
flavors
there
is
a

on

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp

overall
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
porter
and
definitely
the
best
of
the
3
kennebunkport
beers
i
picked
up
recently
overall
man
the
taste
just
ruined
it
for
me
a
pretty
decent
nose
followed
by
a
very

taste
kind

like
getting
to
hook
up
with

girl
and
finding
out
shes
got
halitosis
wont
be
buying
this
again
ive
known
this
brewery
to
make
better
quality
products
so
this
may
be
from
a
bad
batch
but
with
other
great
porters
out
there
im
too
afraid
to
try
this
again
any
time
soon
overall
a
solidly
good
american
porter
went
real
well
with
cider
porkchops
and
i
could
easily
have
another
if
the
carbonation
was
dropped
just
a

it
would
be
even

different

the

is
fine
with
just
the

amount
of
thickness
glad
i
only
got
one
of
these
but
would
try
again
to
see
if
it
was
my
bottle
was
off
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
even
if
it
doesnt
fit
most
peoples
expectations
and
for
1
a
bottle
its
pretty
tough
to
beat
one
of
the
better
of
the
trader
joes
bargain
beers
ive
had
not
a
taste
profile
i
enjoy
strong
aroma
is
smoky
and
slightly

has
smoky
malty

and

not
quite
mouthfilling
but
still
pleasing
smooth

has

minimal
fizz
d
not
very
good
will
not
finish
as
i
have
better
stuff
on
hand
in
the
fridge
for
tonight
first
thing
i
noticed
is
the
carbonation
very
effervescent
unfortunately
because
it
masks
the
flavors
at
first
distracting
its
almost
a
porter
just
not
quite
there
dial
the
carbonation
back
keep
the
roast
and
chocolate
flavor
get
rid
of
the
horrible
finish
and
unwanted
tartness
sour
but
not
in
a
good
wayor
in
an
infected
batch
way
either
more
like
its
just
offbalanced
and
a
poor
brew
perhaps
oxidized
the
flavor
and
the
finish
reminds
me
of
all
the
bad
qualities
of
twobuck
chuck
to
say
it
improves
slightly
as
it
warms
isnt
saying
much
its
off
and
offputting
i
cant
say
much
good
about
this
beer
but
its
not
horrible
enough
to
trash
outright
tjs
has
better
beers
available
for
the
same
price
and
for
a
dollar
or
two
more
you
can
definitely
do
much
better
very
dark
nearly
opaque
with
just
a
hint

from
the

roasty
with
a
bit
of
cocoa
slight

a

dark

with
a
thumb
of

head
with
decent

aromas
of
dark
chocolate
and
maybe
a
bit
of
toffee
pretty
straightforward
the
flavors
are
good
initially
tending
toward
sweet
roastiness
and
finishing
on
a
pleasantly
bitter
notes
of
coffee
and
cocoa
nibs
medium
body
seems
appropriate
for
its
level
of
flavor
complexity
overall
enjoyable
overall
ok
for
the
cheap
beer
that
it
is
6
a
sixpack
at
trader
joes
is
decent
at
that
price
o
wholesome
toasted
malt
character
seemed
more
active
on
the
palate
than
many
porters
overall
a
straight
forward
and
light
bodied
porter
thats
easy
on
the
palate
t
roasted
malts
and
coffee
upfront
then
the
taste
kind
of
just
dies
off
its
not
bad
and
its
by
far
the
best
ive
had
from
kennebunkport
but
its
pedestrian
at
best
the
mouthfeel
is
really
what
kills
it
for
me
its
way
way
thin
taste
is
surprisingly
pleasant
with
a
nice
doughy
yeast
that
also
throws
off
a
few
fruity
esters
roast
is
there
but
is
balanced
nicely
by
a
rich
sweetness
and
chocolate
reminds
me
of
an
oatmeal
stout
without
the
viscous
body
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
slick
and
smooth
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
after
seeing
a
few
of
the
reviews
and
the
overall
score
thanks
ken
this
is
a
porter
in
appearance
but
thats
about
it
it
tastes
dark
but
doesnt
have
the
mouthfeel
or
richness
to
back
it
up
and
the
overall
flavor
profile
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
lacking
the
malty
andor
smokey
features
that
many
great
porters
have
porter
is
the
kind
of
style
you
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
so
this
could
be
a
disappointment
if
youre
looking
forward
to
a
big
rich
experience
ill
stick
with
anchor
porter
when
im
so
inclined
this
beer
is
super
dark
and
completely
opaque
but
unfortunately
produces
a
thin
weak
head
the
smell
is
malty
sweetness
with
some
hints
of
toastiness
the
taste
is
dominated
by
bread
and
dark
fruit
which
doesnt
come
across
as
too
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
nice
dryness
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
but
this
beer
lacks
something
to
set
it
apart
overall
an
average
brew
nothing
to
get
excited
about
this
beer
probably
would
have
gotten
higher
marks
from
me
if
it
was
called
an
amber
definitely
a
miss
for
the
style
but
not
a
miss
overall
it
goes
ok
with
food
its
affordable
just
figure
out
another
name
for
it
or
figure
out
how
to
brew
it
more
consistently
after
reading
some
reviews
they
seem
all
over
the
map
drinkabilityan
average
porter
that
really
does
not
jump
out
of
the
box
it
is
not
bad
but
will
not
wow
you
either
i
would
have
it
again
but
one
was
enough
in
the
end
this
was
just
a
decent
beer
well
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
the
only
decent
things
about
this
beer
the
appearance
was
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
i
guess
i
could
say
that
it
was
almost
like
beer
eye
candy
the
drinkability
is
above
average
because
i
dont
remember
paying
all
that
much
for
this
beer
i
think
it
was
either
below
a
1
or
just
slightly
above
that
if
you
can
find
this
beer
for
a
low
price
go
for
it
d
nothing
horribly
wrong
just
a
very
bland
porter
dark
almost
black
with
a
slight
head
that
fades
quickly
almost
no
lacing
smells
like
roasted
malts
and
vanilla
tastes
of
coffee
and
vanilla
finishes
with
a
coffeetea
like
bitterness
light
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
easy
drinking
decent
gateway
porter
overall
this
is
quite
an
interesting
porter
thats
alcohol
forward
with
an
interesting
vanilla
flavor
its
easy
on
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
porter
it
surprised
me
with
how
good
it
tasted
because
the
appearance
and
aroma
were
not
spectacular
d
this
is
not
a
good
brew
and
definitely
one
to
skip
drinkability
the
low
number
of
reviews
on
ba
for
this
beer
are
interesting
because
it
seems
fairly
readily
available
despite
the
difficult
pour
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
d
not
good
not
terrible
if
you
drink
it
cold
the
taste
is
dry
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
grounds
burnt
bark
and
a
bit
watery
with
a
burnt
bitter
finish
and
aftertaste
as
it
warms
it
becomes
more
mellow
but
despite
some
nice
chocolate
ghosty
caramel
and
other
flavours
lurking
underneath
its
overall
too
sharp
burntbitter
and
plain
for
me
to
really
want
to
drink
d
i
feel
like
for
the
style
this
is
bizarre
but
has
some
interesting
flavors
worth
try
but
dont
come
with
porter
expectations
overall
i
give
this
one
high
marks
for
being
unexpected
im
not
sure
if
id
ever
be
up
for
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
its
creatively
great
bravo
i
understand
why
ol
tjs
chose
this
obscure
brand
in
the
south
anyway
as
this
is
a
quality
beer
i
find
it
interesting
that
most
of
the
low
ratings
on
this
were
from
the
brewpub
on
tap
whereas
the
tj
bottled
version
seemed
to
fare
better
the
taste
is
decent
some
coffee
some
roasted
malt
that
may
be
just
a
bit
too
acridcharcoally
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
to
add
sweetness
its
a
thin
mouthfeelin
beer
and
the
acrid
aftertaste
is
offputting
about
halfway
through
but
all
in
all
it
seems
like
the
best
these
guys
offer
which
isnt
saying
much
poured
a
deep
tannish
brown
with
a
thin
cap
of
head
and
little
to
get
excited
about
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
nose
taste
was
a
tad
bit
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
body
is
thin
and
real
overcarbonated
especially
for
a
porter
a
bad
porter
all
around
no
craftsmanship
at
all
sadly
the
aroma
is
where
this
ride
ends
the
flavor
is
an
unbalanced
chalky
overlycarbonated
blend
of
semiacrid
coffee
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
heavy
metals
the
ionic
variety
not
music
and
wet
newspaper
mouthfeel
isnt
much
better
too
fizzy
with
a
light
body
and
leaves
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
thats
too
metallic
to
be
bitter
this
is
my
first
drain
pour
in
quite
some
time
my
stomach
feels
weird
after
a
third
of
this
one
far
from
my
favorite
porterstone
smoked
porterbut
id
buy
it
again
i
can
only
think
that
actual
powdered
chocolate
was
used
in
this
batch
if
you
dont
like
beer
maybe
youll
like
this
one
better
than
the
others
but
eh
the
same
cheap
impression
i
got
from
the
others
is
still
here
in
the
hazelnutchocolate
aroma
and
flavor
lacks
convincing
roasted
malts
which
are
essential
here
could
be
a
great
combo
with
the
hazelnut
im
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
these
medium
bodied
fairly
drinkable
but
nothing
impressive
but
a
decent
deal
for
less
than
6
bucks
for
a
sixpack
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
buy
6
of
these
flavors
of
dark
fruit
and
milk
chocolate
the
backbone
is
a
tad
weak
and
seltzery
a
bitter
coffee
snap
awaits
on
the
finish
major
butter
cotton
candy
flavors
are
evident
its
that
classic
pusleyportland
yeast
flare
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
overall
and
nicely
priced
at
trader
joes
like
the
annoad
system
not
much
there
377
not
the
biggest
fan
of
chocolate
flavors
but
this
was
pleasant
an
extremely
smooth
porter
sessionable
but
almost
wish
it
had
a
little
more
bite
to
it
that
said
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
again
pretty
damn
good
beer
easy
drinking
sam
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
beer
had
every
aspect
that
separates
a
english
porter
from
an
american
porter
and
while
i
do
prefer
american
porters
i
can
still
appreciate
this
beer
and
know
that
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
just
how
true
to
style
it
is
its
just
what
i
expect
from
an
english
porter
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
it
didnt
have
any
off
aspects
or
anything
that
shouldnt
be
there
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
english
porters
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
i
had
heard
this
was
good
and
it
lived
up
to
it
this
beer
made
for
a
good
first
impression
of
this
brewery
and
i
would
be
interested
to
try
more
of
their
beers
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
is
the
best
english
porter
ive
had
good
job
guys
this
this
was
a
good
beer
keep
it
up
would
i
buy
this

this
extraordinarily
sugary
and
sweeta
dessert
in
a
bottle
overall
god
what
a
joy
it
is
to
revisit
the
greats
a
beer
this
fluid
should
not
be
this
flavorful
and
enjoyable
nice
toasty
porter
without
the
ridiculous
amounts
of
sweetness
that
can
ruin
a
porter
rich
dark
and
complex
says
the
bottle
and
that
about
summarizes
it
a
very
strong
flavor
a
bit
like
a
roasted
stout
but
softer
good
for
social
events
or
personal
degustations
a
bit
overkill
for
sports
or
outside
events
o
an
interpretation
of
porter
that
blurs
the
line
with
english
stout
basically
lighter
in
color
and
in
bitterness
but
with
the
coffeeish
notes
enjoyed
this
very
much
middle
of
the
pack
porter
perfect
example
of
this
style
nothing
to
rave
about
solid
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
it
definitely
won
me
over
it
poured
very
dark
but
not
opaque

delicious

and

gentle
but
noticeable
lingering
hops
finish
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
fullers
o
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
perhaps
the
archetype
given
its
longevity

a

excellent
example
of
a

nice

flavors
smoothly
balanced
with
just
a
hint
of
bitter
at
the
finish
i
was
introduced
to
this
in
a
pub
in
richmond
a
few
months
ago
it
is
a
world
class
brew
well
respect
to
a
classic
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
very
good
in
every
regard
did
not
like
at
all
just
not
my
taste
delicious
to
me
its
perfect
there
may
be
better
porters
that
i
dont
know
about
yet
but
this
is
exactly
what
i
think
a
porter
should
be
the
chocolate
smell
the
chocolate
taste
the
coffee
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
without
being
overwhelmed
by
sweetness
the
drinkability
overall
quite
a
nice
english
porter
very
traditional
and
good
quality
the
price
is
a
bit
over
the
top
as
most
english
beers
are
in
australia
an
equivalent
case
of
24
x
330ml
bottles
is
around
au110
can
definitely
get
similar
for
far
less
but
one
every
now
and
then
wont
hurt

clear
pour
that
is
almost
as
dark
as
a
stout
but
has
a
dark
ruby
cast
slightly
below
average
head
volume
and
retention
but
laces
well
nice
nose
of
caramel
coffee
toffee
and
a
slight
burnt
chocolate
smokiness
medium
bodied
with
a
texture
that
approaches
creamy
slightly
below
normal
carbonation
with
just
a
touch
of
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
excellent
flavor
profile
is
complex
and
balanced
it
begins
with
coffee
then
flows
into
a
light
caramel
sweetness
coupled
with
toffee
hops
come
forward
in
the
middle
with
a
light
flavor
and
bitterness
over
a
smoky
chocolate
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
and
leaves
you
with
a
lingering
chocolate
smokiness
with
a
mineral
character
i
personally
enjoyed
the
aroma
more
than
the
flavor
and
while
the
flavor
is
also
quite
enjoyable
i
would
have
liked
it
more
if
it
had
followed
the
nose
more
closely
and
then
persisted
in
that
regard
nevertheless
i
did
indeed
enjoy
this
porter
immensely
and
look
forward
to
having
it
again
lovely
flavorful
and
malty
beer
yummy
aftertaste
o
great
porter
its
smooth
perfectly
balanced
and
has
those
wonderful
english
style
flavors
o
one
of
my
favourite
beers
ever
its
great
that
its
available
and
affordable
too
a
very
wonderful
low
abv
flavour
bomb
an
outstanding
porter
pours
a
nice
dark
roast
with
a
moderate
head
that
breaks
down
to
a
few
bubbles
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
promising
a
taste
that
does
not
dissappoint
great
long
finish
o
my
first
time
trying
this
one
and
i
was
not
disappointed
im
a
huge
fan
of
porter
and
stout
style
beers
and
this
fit
right
it
buy
some
and
see
for
yourself
final
thoughts
i
think
this
porter
would
be
a
knock
out
on
nitro
or
cask
allowing
the
malt
to
really
shine
but
even
after
my
first
taste
of
this
historic
beer
i
completely
understand
why
it
has
stood
the
test
of
time
its
just
a
plain
great
example
of
the
style
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
the
beer
pours
some
cream
colored
and
creamy
textured
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
brown
with
a
bit
of
dark
brown
notes
the
beer
smell
is
rich
and
divine
the
smell
has
a
combination
of
bready
yeast
smell
with
a
coffee
smell
and
a
sweet
and
light
dark
chocolate
smell
the
beer
also
has
a
milky
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
a
bit
different
than
the
smell
the
taste
is
less
milky
than
the
smell
and
has
stronger
bitter
hop
notes
the
bready
yeast
note
is
still
there
but
not
as
pronounced
the
coffee
roast
taste
is
also
there
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
silky
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
english
porter
and
worth
its
reputation
my
mark
out
of
100
would
be
88
expected
a
lot
going
in
and
i
was
not
dissapointed
if
you
like
a
smoked
porter
theres
probably
none
more
great
o
its
an
archetype
what
more
to
say
o
wow
this
is
one
beautiful
malty
treat
its
got
the
perfect
amount
of
roast
and
coffee
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
sweetness
the
hop
base
gives
a
mild
bitter
underpinning
while
still
letting
the
malt
steal
the
show
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
those
who
dont
like
the
full
body
of
a
stout
but
want
a
stout
character
a
definite
winner
a
very
nice
1
79
spent
coco
coffee
malty
nose
dark
toasted
oats
roasted
nuts
dominate
the
flavor
with
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
malts
coming
through
and
a
wonderful
coffee
finish
couldnt
really
notice
any
significant
hops
presence
as
the
coffee
rules
the
finish
a
nice
porter
and
very
nice
for
the
price
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
tend
to
think
of
english
porters
as
being
slightly
sour
this
beer
lacks
that
element
other
than
this
flaw
it
is
very
enjoyable
the
taste
does
highlight
some
of
the
toasty
malty
characters
and
biscuit
mild
finish
i
mean
it
is
one
of
the
porters
that
others
strive
to
emulate
overall
really
impressed
with
the
coffee
and
chocolately
flavors
o
an
easydrinking
and
very
sessionable
porter
which
id
gladly
opt
for
if
having
a
few
pints
with
friends
at
a
pub
overall
i
shouldve
known
what
i
was
getting
into
after
trying
anchor
porter
the
other
week
this
was
just
too
sweet
with
not
enough
coffee
notes
i
prefer
american
style
porters
all
the
way
founders
smuttynose
eddy
fitz
o
a
tasty
and
refined
porter
very
easy
drinking
and
sippable
ill
have
to
revisit
founders
breakfast
stout
to
recall
what
that
has
that
this
one
apparently
does
not
besides
higher
abv
and
fuller
body
based
on
the
differences
in
the
ba
ratings
of
the
two
this
was
a
treat
that
i
will
not
hestiate
to
go
back
to
when
in
the
mood
for
a
lower
abv
dark
beer
or
porter
fullers
london
porter
has
earned
its
world
class
reputation
in
my
book
well
done
indeed
this
porter
just
blends
the
flavors
together
so
they
just
flow
over
the
palette
to
make
a
smooth
velvet
flow
of
deliciousness
food
match
im
gonna
have
to
stew
on
this
one
literally
overall
one
of
the
best
porters
you
could
have
another
please
cheers
fullers
london
porter
was
a
blast
to
drink
and
so
quaffable
i
could
make
an
evening
of
just
drinking
this
beer
the
wonderfully
sweet
nose
blends
well
with
the
complex
palate
of
bittersweet
roasty
and
bready
flavors
pours
a
molassescolored
body
good
head
at
first
but
doesnt
stay
long
and
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
is
coffee
grains
dark
chocolate
with
roasted
malt
in
the
back
medium
strength
coffee
as
main
flavor
bit
of
bitter
chocolate
but
the
depth
of
the
taste
is
not
great
slight
metallic
finish
not
fullbodied
at
all
middling
average
on
most
accounts
overall
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
are
excellent
balance
is
sweet
and
then
wiped
off
the
palate
by
gentle
but
creeping
roasted
qualities
hoppiness
comes
through
i
revisited
this
old
favorite
because
bjcp
has
it
listed
as
an
example
of
brown
porter
brown
porter
my
ass
this
is
as
robust
as
they
come
o
easy
drinking
complex
balanced
urges
you
to
sip
it
with
some
air
coming
in
as
you
do
to
enhance
the
lovely
smokey
bouquet
almost
tobacco
smoke
like
a
sweet
unfiltered
churchmans
cigarette

o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
characterize
it
as
a
prime
example
of
the
porter
category
prost
lampertland
o
a
porter
that
fully
lives
up
to
its
reputation
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
wide
range
of
flavors
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
or
porter
and
noticed
this
at
the
local
lcbo
which
is
shamefully
devoid
of
those
styles
for
whatever
god
awful
reason
i
had
it
in
mind
that
fullers
wasnt
considered
to
be
a
good
brewery
but
i
was
quickly
corrected
after
both
checking
the
score
on
ba
and
trying
it
for
myself
top
notch
brew
which
i
found
to
be
immensely
satisfying
glad
i
bought
two
bottle
from
proof
bottle
shop
deep
clear
brown
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
fair
lacing
with
good
head
retention
tons
of
caramel
in
the
aroma
with
some
noticeable
toasted
malt
taste
is
still
lots
of
caramel
and
dreads
with
some
deep
maltiness
great
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
medium
to
full
body
perfect
for
the
style
although
it
is
impressive
it
isnt
something
i
would
drink
regularly
as
the
style
is
a
bit
heavy
for
my
usual
but
in
the
future
i
am
sure
i
will
buy
this
again
and
if
porters
are
your
thing
you
probably
already
know
this
is
a
great
one
i
love
fullers
as
a
brewery
and
i
have
waited
a
while
to
try
this
classic
porter
not
because
it
is
particularly
difficult
to
track
down
but
because
as
a
darker
malty
beer
it
keeps
longer
in
my
way
overstocked
beer
fridge
gotta
drink
the
hoppy
ones
first
to
capture
the
fresh
aromatics
finally
fished
a
bottle
out
because
it
was
a
cold
porter
or
stout
kind
of
night
anyhow
many
sources
claim
that
a
good
porter
is
dark
brown
to
blackish
with
beautiful
ruby
red
highlights
e
g
see
fosters
book
on
porter
in
the
classic
beer
styles
series
lo
and
behold
thats
exactly
what
this
brew
looks
like
quite
sexy
yes
sexy
aroma
is
rich
chocolate
roasted
chicory
sweet
dried
fruit
and
a
little
english
hop
earthiness
a
little
like
sniffing
a
bag
of
chocolatecovered
raisins
palate
lives
up
to
the
hype
massive
english
malt
rustic
complexity
coupled
with
dark
rich
aromatic
flavors
of
treacle
butterscotch
toffee
pipe
tobacco
and
a
little
leather
some
floral
aromatics
and
a
tangy
sour
note
dance
on
top
and
there
is
also
a
healthy
blast
of
dark
bread
crust
likely
from
genuine
brown
malt
highly
kilned
rather
than
stewed
but
theres
chocolate
malt
in
here
too
with
the
latter
particularly
prominent
in
the
finish
along
with
a
little
charcoal
less
sweet
and
sour
and
more
rich
and
toasty
than
some
other
london
porters
probably
this
one
is
the
benchmark
for
the
lot
moderately
thick
body
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
but
the
finish
is
a
nice
earthy
bitterness
that
prevents
things
from
getting
too
sweet
or
bubbly
should
be
on
any
english
beer
fans
top
10
list
and
you
can
even
get
this
in
cans
now
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
porters
that
ive
tried
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
again
as
a
major
fan
of
porters
this
one
is
about
as
good
as
they
get
the
pour
is
a
beautiful
mahogany
brown
almost
ebony
with
a
luscious
full
two
finger
head
which
eventually
fades
to
a
small
retention
ring
lacing
is
impressive
too
all
the
great
porter
notes
are
present
coffee
chocolate
toffee
caramel
licorice
roasted
nuts
the
taste
easy
drinking
follows
the
nose
almost
perfectly
what
is
really
impressive
is
that
flavors
are
very
subtle
and
move
seamlessly
from
one
to
the
other
culminating
in
a
delightful
roasted
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
thick
and
satisfying
this
one
is
a
must
for
fans
of
porters
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
can
easily
picture
myself
drinking
this
as
a
session
beer
for
a
bbq
or
steak
cookout
very
well
balanced
flavorful
and
light
i
believe
ive
found
myself
a
new
goto
overall
very
complex
beer
its
not
my
favority
profile
but
really
interesting
and
well
made
but
love
the
complexity
and
balance
will
definately
drink
this
again
overall
a
nice
example
of
an
english
porter
overall
was
hoping
this
would
be
a
good
beer
hadnt
viewed
any
ratings
here
to
know
what
the
expectations
were
and
expectations
were
shattered
brilliant
beer
one
that
keeps
you
looking
for
the
next
sip
constantly
a
great
sipper
that
i
hope
to
enjoy
soon
by
allowing
it
to
warm
a
bit
first
for
added
effect
o
a
damn
near
perfect
english
porter
simple
classic
elegant
its
east
to
see
why
fullers
has
been
around
so
long
by
cranking
out
quality
products
like
this
for
the
last
150
odd
years
im
thrilled
that
this
is
now
available
in
my
area
and
will
be
buying
it
often
this
is
just
an
awesome
beer
all
around
definitely
a
buyagain
atmosphere
is
excellent
dark
hue
nice
head
lots
of
carbonation
and
some
fair
lacing
nose
is
great
combination
of
coffee
wood
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
complex
combination
of
coffee
and
tea
wood
and
peat
bitter
chocolate
and
licorice
has
a
very
roasted
character
to
it
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
500
ml

almost
black

off

that
leaves

big

smell
is
earthy
coffee
dark
fruits
chocolate
it
goes
caressing
your
tongue
with
a
coffee
palate
then
comes
a
chocolate
cherries
and
dark
fruits
coffee
liquor
like
kahlua
or
tia
maria
comes
to
mind
more
complex
than
what
i
really
said
its
a
great
beer
o
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
into
portersstouts
and
isnt
looking
for
an
over
abundance
of
bitterness
fullers
london
porter
is
packed
with
malty
goodness
that
will
not
disappoint
poured
into
pint
glass
and
immediately
thought
it
looks
a
little
light
for
a
porter
but
it
has
a
nice
white
head
and
lace
or
at
least
a
little
lighter
than
most
porters
the
smell
has
that
burnt
malt
smell
youd
expect
but
is
also
has
a
sweetness
to
it
that
you
usually
dont
smell
in
a
porter
at
this
point
im
not
really
expecting
much
out
of
this
beer
the
first
sip
changed
my
thinking
quick
very
creamy
and
bold
it
might
be
a
little
light
but
not
to
extreme
to
discount
this
as
a
porter
i
very
much
enjoyed
the
consistency
and
drinkability
i
think
you
can
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
session
overall
i
really
liked
this
and
will
definitely
have
more
of
these
is
the
fall
and
winter
with
some
chilli
worth
trying
o
very
nice
beer
interesting
complex
flavours
but
very
drinkable
nonetheless
overall
a
very
nice
porter
bitterness
is
present
but
in
a
perfect
combination
with
this
classic
english
style
one
to
revisit
overall
a
classic
beer
maybe
has
lost
a
touch
over
the
years
or
it
could
be
modern
extreme
beers
stealing
the
spotlight
but
there
still
is
something
to
be
said
for
simple
full
flavored
modest
abv
beers
id
always
be
willing
to
include
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
o
a
fantastic
malt
forward
porter
well
balanced
with
an
english
hop
finish
o
lovin
it
excellent
example
of
an
english
brown
porter
lower
hop
and
roast
bitterness
than
many
american
examples
easy
drinking
and
superbly
balanced
o
ive
had
many
examples
of
american
porters
and
enjoyed
most
of
them
but
this
is
the
real
deal
its
even
brewed
in
jolly
ole
england
i
found
it
to
be
extremely
balanced
with
every
facet
playing
off
of
and
complimenting
the
other
i
also
liked
that
it
wasnt
all
hopped
up
like
so
many
of
its
american
counterparts
i
can
envision
myself
pounding
back
several
pints
of
it
with
me
mates
at
a
london
pub
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
an
outstanding
porter
this
classic
porter
has
a
dark
drown
earthy
color
near
black
with
a
tall
head
of
soft
foam
this
beer
has
minimal
carbonation
and
gains
some
points
for
excellent
head
retention
and
lacing
the
pleasant
aroma
ive
drawn
in
is
mostly
dark
fruit
esters
and
molasses
after
a
tasting
more
complexity
is
noted
bringing
to
mind
mocha
toffee
and
graham
cracker
crust
the
mouth
feel
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
and
the
finish
even
has
a
light
touch
of
hop
bitterness
this
could
be
my
favorite
overall
low
abv
beer
overall

london
pride
is
a
great
dark
ale
thats
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
everything
comes
together
to
yield
a
porter
thats
tasty
and
easy
to
knock
back
if
not
quite
at
sessionable
abv
levels
while
generally
10
per
sixer
in
nj
eastern
us
its
worth
the
price
tag
would
definitely
have
bought
a
few
for
tonight
had
i
known
i
would
have
liked
it
so
much
overall
there
is
a
reason
this
is
a
classic
it
is
not
as
adventurous
as
many
new
craft
porters
but
it
is
solid
and
there
is
a
lot
to
appreciate
o
another
classic
by
fullers
one
of
my
favorite
porters
so
complex
and
so
delicious
a
brew
that
is
tough
to
set
the
glass
down
i
felt
like
i
just
poured
it
started
making
notes
on
the
review
and
before
i
knew
it
it
was
all
gone
now
im
a
little
sad
that
i
dont
have
another
i
feel
that
the
beer
has
the
same
appearance
smell
and
taste
as
previouse
reviews
i
am
writing
this
to
note
that
the
roasted
hops
come
on
strong
and
one
would
expect
a
powerful
taste
but
this
beer
is
suprisingly
light
an
complex
given
its
rich
and
dark
smell
and
appearance
excellent
beer
not
at
all
acrid
plenty
of
chocolate
not
overly
sweet
very
well
balanced
two
words
london
perfect
overall
the
shining
example
of
a
quaffable
porter
packed
full
of
earthy
flavors
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
overall
certainly
worth
a
go
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
kernel
to
h
e
double
hockeysticks
with
the
big
boy
beers
get
out
there
and
taste
what
really
makes
a
beer
like
this
a
craft
it
was
crafted
long
ago
and
perfected
over
the
years
there
is
ages
of
experience
in
this
beer
and
you
have
to
give
it
a
try
if
you
hate
dark
beers
this
is
by
no
means
a
mild
dark
beer
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
and
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
it
i
guarantee
that
in
the
least
you
will
appreciate
this
beer
as
a
quality
beer
you
may
not
like
it
in
which
case
i
would
deem
you
insane
but
you
will
know
what
a
good
beer
truly
is
life
is
too
short
to
waste
on
watered
down
experiences
go
full
throttle

yell
here
overall
drinkability
this
strikes
me
as
an
excellent
example
of
an
english
porter
not
my
favorite
style
of
porter
but
this
one
is
worth
it
overall
what
a
great
beer
bold
yet
smooth
complex
yet
chugable
how
do
the
english
do
it
o
a
fantastic
sipping
english

porter
that
is
perfect
for

might
pick
up

be

dark

the

flat
for
us
the
roasted
nutty
malted
flavor
and
creaminess
are
apparent
and
taste
great
but
without
much
depth
or
many
nuances
it
seems
to
not
go

distance
good
beer
but
there
are
others
that
are

also

and
im
not

if
i
prefer
this
or
taddy
porter
in

form
id
choose
the
taddy
but
the
london
porter
on

takes
the
cake
until
i
can
find
taddy

i
cant

is

i
could
enjoy
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
would
gladly
indulge
in
this
again
and
highly
recommend
if
you
ever
find
it
try
it
overall
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
comparable
to
samuel
smiths
taddy
porter
a
recent
wave
of
american
porters
in
which
adjuncts
or
specialized
malts
are
used
to
foreground
the
flavors
that
classical
porters
like
this
one
suggest
here
i
am
thinking
of
the
dozens
of
nutty
e
g
pecan
porters
chocolate
porters
coffee
porters
etc
that
i
have
tried
in
recent
years
fullers
london
porter
achieves
similar
effects
while
maintaining
a
lightness
and
drinkability
outstanding
overall
excellent
stuff
from
london
o
as
with
others
of
this
style
it
gets
high
marks
for
drinkability
not
quite
as
good
as
taddy
porter
but
certainly
a
great
beer
for
a
cool
fall
evening
like
tonight
the
classic
english
porter
that
is
one
of
the
best
porters
brewed
today
just
a
wonderfully
crafted
ale
overall
a
fundamental
wonderful
porter
that
is
not
called
worlds
finest

nothing

o
first
beer
ive
tried
from
england
and
its
pretty
good
very
complex
but
yet
not
overbearing
and
very
refreshing
little
bit
lacking
on
the
flavor
side
especially
for
a
porter
in
my
opinion
but
i
like
the
style
going
here
so
its
a
beer
to
get
a
hold
of
the
pros
way
exceed
the
cons
overall
what
a
darn
fine
product
i
didnt
expect
to
see
the
bros
rate
it
so
highly
especially
since
i
cosider
it
more
of
a
commercial
brew
but
everyone
elses
reviews
support
my
feelings
about
this
stuff
less
of
a
stout
drinker
but
i
appreciate
a
really
good
stout
or
porter
once
in
awhile
but
more
accustomed
to
the
higher
abved
versions
i
recommend
this
heartily
and
because
its
commercial
it
shouldnt
be
too
difficult
to
find
if
you
have
a
bevmo
or
total
wine
near
you
i
would
definitely
like
to
find
this
in
a
keg
somewhere
edmund
fitzgerald
wants
to
be
this
fortunately
this
beer
is
a
regular
on
the
shelves
of
waitrose
and
many
other
places
with
good
selections
of
bottled
beer
i
am
pretty
sure
this
is
the
best
english
porter
ive
encountered
its
not
particularly
exciting
in
any
way
but
its
nicely
balanced
tasty
and
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
o
no
wonder
its
at
the
top
of
the
list
eh
this
is
a
classic
and
it
is
excellent
o
one
of
the
best
porters
out
there
i
compare
it
to
founders
porter
o
roasted
and
robust
fullers
london
porter
is
a
chocolate
and
coffeelike
flavored
treat
which
all
comes
from
the
malt
complexity
no
added
ingredients
its
fullbodied
but
at
no
point
does
it
become
thick
or
undrinkable
and
its
so
bold
in
flavor
its
impressive
the
beer
remains
around
5
alcohol
fullers
london
porter
is
a
stellar
beer
for
any
occasion
o
a
really
well
rounded
porter
from
beginning
to
end
nice
complexity
and
depth
o
overall
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
drank
thus
far
overall
i
like
this
stout
its
thinner
then
most
but
is
packed
with
flavor
its
not
hiding
in
subtleties
but
just
delivers
the
coffee
chocolate
licorice
and
caramel
flavors
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
a
light
bitter
if
i
had
to
criticize
it
id
say
its
lacking
a
bit
of
depth
its
not
something
id
drink
all
night
because
it
starts
to
bore
a
little
after
one
although
to
me
this
is
quite
common
for
a
stout
it
may
be
a
little
too
sweet
and
straight
forward
for
me
to
enjoy
even
more
but
its
one
of
the
better
stouts
out
there
so
id
say
recommended

robust
and
well
balanced
malty
sweetness
with
a
nicely
dry
hop
finish
this
is
a
beer
ive
drunk
for
years
an
absolutely
excellent
go
to
pint
well
done
fullers
overall
a
great
porter
for
fans
of
such
the
smoke
taste
becomes
more
prominent
after
a
few
a
great
beer
to
grab
at
a
bar
but
hard
to
sit
down
to
a
six
pack
good
solid
porter
not
convinced
its
a
good
as
the
skyhigh
ba
rating
tho
however
due
to
it
not
having
massive
flavours
i
suspect
i
could
drink
all
night
i
loved
this
beer
78
years
ago
but
then
it
seemed
to
disappear
from
minnesota
i
finally
saw
it
again
so
picked
up
a
single
to
review
luckily
i
still
like
it
unluckily
i
managed
to
spill
about
half
the
beer
in
a
kitchen
mishap
very
nice
balanced
beer
that
you
can
have
a
few
of
and
not
get
sloppy
very
good
beer
superb
one
of
if
not
the
best
porters
ive
ever
had
the
fuller
smith
and
turner
partnership
dating
back
to
1845
brews
an
excellent
range
of
awardwinning
ales
many
of
which
are
available
in
the
ysa
including
london
pride
pale
ale
and
the
worlds
original
esb
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
trying
all
our
fine
ales
flp
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
i
didnt
expect
to
get
such
a
treat
when
i
bought
this
one
it
pours
a
nearopaque
dark
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
but
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
overloaded
with
malts
but
very
good
with
just
a
touch
of
coffee
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
and
very
wellbalanced
very
dry
finish
ill
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
smooth
and
warming
brew
that
is
almost
a
meal
on
its
own
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
i
didnt
like
it
at
the
the
frist
mouthfull
for
me
it
better
in
the
middle
and
the
end
great
last
taste
nice
bottle
i
think
i
will
try
the
english
porters
again
really
this
is
the
only
english
porter
around
here
they
had
many
new
beers
at
wegmans
today
a
great
taste
great
color
great
pour
in
the
glass
overal
a
pleaseant
session
beer
drinkable
and
balanced
an
excellent
porter
with
awesome
chocolate
notes
that
arent
in
your
face
very
well
balanced
with
a
decent
amount
of
hops
and
an
interesting
faint
dryness
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
not
much
going
on
in
the
coffee
department
a
very
tasty
english
porter
some
of
the
best
money
can
buy
o
this
beer
is
very
tasty
with
excellent
complexity
in
the
smell
and
taste
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
like
to
have
it
again
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
sessionable
o
just
edges
out
samuel
smiths
with
a
slightly
more
complex
aroma
both
are
amazing
english
porters
though
they
are
a
little
pricey
but
definitely
worth
it
o
overall
this
is
a
fine
porter
that
should
be
sought
after
not
overly
robust
in
any
category
yet
does
nothing
poorly
and
deserves
a
fine
recommendation

none

a

the
most

a

its
very

and
the
taste
stays
fairly
well
d
delicious
and
oh
so
complex
the
bottled
version
is
a
good
porter
but
this
draft
is
an
incredible
and
worldclass
beer
this
a
fine

porter
it
is
full
of

there
is
a

to
it
which
is
unsettling
and
throwing
me
off
a
little
picked
it
up
because
it
was
a
top
100
but
at
this
point
i
could
pick
a

more
beers
to
me
that

very

i
picked
this
can
up
on
a
whim
without
reading
about

what
a
great

but
i
feel
like
the
drinkability
could
be
improved
by
a

more
hoppiness
to
eliminate

weird

it

nice
round

with

this
is
one
smooth

porter
the
flavor
is
smoky
dry

choclat
the
flavor
is
robust
but
at
the

time
tame
very
concise
and
the
after
taste
is
drier
with
all
the
sweet
parts
still
present
maybe
even
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
beneath
the
whole

a
very
drinkable

tasty
porter
notes
easy
to
drink
rich
tasty
and
complex
flavors
open
up
more
as
it

this
would
be
great
as
a
dessert
beer
but
can
certainly
stand
on
its
own
as
well
this
is
the
quintessential
english
porter
and
a
real
treat
to
drink
d
easy
drinking
porter
tastes
like
another
which
is
a
bit
rare
for
me
with
porters
drinks
well
not
robust
but
there
is
some
flavor
there
wont
be
a
regular
but
i
would
drink
again
d
absolute
classic
much
more
than
an
after
dinner
beer
i
could
enjoy
this
all
day
d
a
classic
example
of
the
style
something
id
drink
lots
of
was
so
happy
to
find
it
here
fullers
london
porter
is
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
khaki
head
aroma
was
a
minimal
with
a
little
roasted
malt
but
not
too
much
although
this
is
certainly
due
to
the
very
low
carbonation
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
bittersweet
chocolate
caramel
a
touch
of
coffee
with
a
clean
dry
finish
the
beer
was
smooth
and
carbed
appropriately
low
i
love
everything
about
this
beer
except
that
i
wish
it
was
thicker
d
a
tasty
porter
but
ive
had
better
it
was
flavourful
but
a
little
too
metallic
for
my
liking
im
inclined
to
think
that
this
bottle
may
have
been
too
aged
and
was
on
the
verge
of
turning
sour
i
will
have
to
try
it
again
to
see
if
it
was
just
the
bottle
worthy
to
any
porter
fan
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
drinkability
i
think
its
very
drinkable
i
think
its
a
good
beer
to
get
if
your
just
getting
into
stouts
or
porters
but
still
enjoyable
for
all
the
porter
and
stout
fans
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
slightly
below
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
great
flavors
to
it
and
the
balance
really
helps
it
too
a
very
easy
drinking
smooth
and
flavorful
beer
overall
a
classic
example
of
the
style
d
high
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
really
recommended
delicious
and
so
damn
chocolaty
this
classic
stands
up
quite
handsomely
in
a
can
and
is
a
welcome
addition
to
fullers
ranks
sweet
with
a
lot
of
good
caramel
and
chocolate
flavor
this
beer
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
its
size
theres
caramel
chocolate
roast
and
light
fruitier
malt
touches
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
caramel
and
chocolate
theres
a
bit
of
herbal
hopping
in
there
maybe
its
just
a
bit
too
sweet
ultimately
the

bar
which
is

less
negatively
than
it
reads
i
think
my
scores
would
go
up
with
a
stronger
mouthfeel
it
seems
a
little
thin
and
a
full
creamy
feel
would
go
a
long
way
with
this
beer
i
would
definitely
enjoy
trying
it
from

nicely

reminds

more
of

sumatra
if

ever
had
it

anything
else
nice
clean
bitterness
in
the
finish
hop
character
lends
a
nice
amount
of
earthy
notes
to
the
whole
affair
overall
a
very
enjoyable
porter
and
a
nice
night
cap
to
my
labor
day
drink
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
and
again
overall
a
very
solid
porter
flavors
are
perfectly
balanced
and
rich
but
not
overthetop
a
must
have
for
porter
lovers
d
rolls
off
the
tongue
near
black
pour
with
just
faint
hint
of
mahogany
highlights
and
a
big
frothy
tan
head
the
aroma
smells
like
malted
chocolate
milk
with
a
fair
amount
of
roast
and
a
hint
of
coffee
the
malted
chocolate
milk
flavor
really
continues
through
from
the
aroma
with
a
few
notes
of
coffee
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
the
body
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
has
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
and
soft
carbonation
great
flavors
and
easy
drinking
all
the
flavors
are
subtle
yet
this
is
a
great
porter
to
sit
down
with
its
balanced
and
interesting
and
fairly
smooth
the
slight
sour
finish
just
added
an
extra
dimension
that
wasnt
overdone
and
enjoyable
pours
dark
ruby
with
a
nice
thin
beige
head

retains
nicely
one
of
the
best
smelling
porters

come
across

roasty
and
chocolate
creamy
mouthfeel
great
coffee
taste
and
roasted
tones
vanilla

and
bittersweet

make
their
presence
known

too
pricey
6
for
a
relatively
unenjoyable
drinking
experience
love
porters
but
not
this
one
absolutely
brilliant
pours
from
the
bottle
a
very
dark
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
a
light
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
head
that
lasts
about
3
minutes
aromas
are
predominately
of
sweet
malts
with
roasty
notes
taking
a
back
seat
strong
toffee
and
slightly
less
intense
chocolate
aromas
hit
me
first
i
also
detect
notes
vaguely
reminiscent
of
hazelnut
coffee
tastewise
the
front
and
midpalate
are
very
evenly
balanced
between
these
sweet
and
bitter
elements
finishes
long
on
with
a
tasty
toffee
character
mediumlight
body
with
moderate
carbonation
feels
smooth
through
and
through
intensitywise
its
flavors
are
not
strong
enough
to
pair
with
chocolates
but
when
had
all
its
own
this
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
beers
the
palate
is
smooth
and
chewy
but
could
be
creamier
drinks
amazingly
beer
is
medium
body
mildly
sweet
minimal
coffee
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
with
decent
bitterness
beer
is
quite
sessionable
but
there
is
an
unfortunate
aftertaste
of
ashiness
that
i
do
not
find
that
desirable
its
a
minor
problem
but
it
does
detract
from
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
drinkability
the
rich
chocolateespresso
taste
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
bite
on
the
finish
the
result
is
a
complex
flavor
that
can
only
truly
be
experienced
slowly
m
enjoyable
creamy
body
with
a
lasting
ending
a
little
too
bitter
d
the
expense
is
the
only
barrier
to
this
being
a
perfect
session
beer
overall
quite
drinkable
not
an
overpowering
dark
beer
this
is
almost
as
good
as
it
gets
it
has
its
own
very
unique
character
and
its
a
beer
youll
return
to
over
and
over
again
im
not
sure
why
but
it
somehow
feels
stronger
than
it
really
is
d
nice
porter
a
bit
drier
than
other
porters
ive
had
interesting
mild
aroma
of
roasty
chocolate
malts
mild
carbonation
and
a
nice
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
prominent
chocolate
biscuit
and
coffee
notes
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
on
the
finish
makes
this
one
very
pleasant
and
easydrinking
tasty
to
the
end
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
meal
in
and
of
itself
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
dont
plan
on
spending
a
whole
night
with
this
beer
its
still
a
treat
for
the
night
youre
wanting
something
dark
a
very
well
balanced
porter
i
like
it
a
lot
at
5
4
abv
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
would
not
mind
buying
this
again
d
wow
this
has
gotta
be
one
of
my
favorite
porters
i
absolutely
love
the
intense
smokey
flavor
aroma
its
what
ive
been
seeking
for
a
long
time
this
beer
is
so
damn
good
i
could
easily
drink
4
pints
of
this
fantastic
brew
i
highly
recommend
this
one
and
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
cheers
easily
a
recommended
brew
in
this
style
the
first
every
porter
i
tried
and
still
my
favorite
english
style
porter
pours
your
standard
dark
brown
color
with
tan
head
i
absolutely
love
the
nose
on
this
beer
it
smells
like
brewing
dark
beers
with
that
huge
roast
and
chocolate
maltiness
there
are
just
enough
bittering
hops
to
prevent
it
from
being
too
sweet
they
start
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
fade
to
the
huge
roasty
chocolate
malt
flavors
just
a
fantastic
lingering
finish
to
it
very
drinkable
and
can
see
why
this
is
rated
so
highly
detected
some
alcohol
around
halfway
through
this
was
really
nice
with
a
piece
of
chocolate
torte
but
this
would
be
great
on
its
own
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
perfect
pint
16aug10
indicated
on
the
back
label
perfect
pour
entire
bottle
into
the
glass
with
the
head
neatly
falling
between
the
blue
lines
and
the
lip
of
the
glass
body
was
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
rocky
tancolored
head
that
sizzled
and
popped
as
it
slowly
receded
into
a
sudsy
skim
leaving
tiny
spots
of
lacing
in
its
wake
big
roasty
chocolatey
malty
nose
from
the
bottle
with
a
slightly
metallic
quality
coming
out
in
the
glass
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
a
some
lactose
and
a
bit
of
char
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
creamy
texture
what
a
delicious
porter
some
qualities
seem
to
slightly
mirror
a
milk
stout
i
e
the
creaminess
lactose
chocolatey
goodness
but
the
charred
character
brings
it
all
back
resulting
in
a
highly
drinkable
and
flavorful
porter
its
only
5
4
abv
but
it
feels
stronger
the
flavor
mix
is
very
robust
this
beer
really
has
character
i
highly
recommend
to
drink
it
slowly
otherwise
its
kind
of
heavy
on
you
also
you
might
want
to
pair
it
with
some
bitter
chocolate
i
will
make
this
a
staple
considering
i
can
only
get
the
great
lakes
when
im
up
in
ohio
this
stuff
is
scrumptious
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
finished
this
one
fast
but
i
do
wonder
if
everything
above
would
be
a
hair
higher
in
intensitygoodness
if
i
had
gotten
one
of
these
fresh
i
easily
would
have
had
another
if
it
was
available
drinkable
by
itself
or
with
a
meal
but
a
meat
and
potatoes
sort
of
meal
it
is
much
better
in
the
bottle
then
it
is
from
the
can
a
very
solid
english
porter
i
will
buy
again
pours
a
dark
burgundybrown
with
little
to
no
head
though
my
pour
was
pretty
weak
the
smell
reminded
me
a
lot
of
kahlua
its
a
mixture
of
sweet
coffee
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
sweetened
coffee
is
the
most
prominent
taste
followed
by
slightly
bitter
chocolate
and
touches
of
vanilla
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
flavor
of
this
id
really
like
this
to
be
thicker
but
thats
a
common
theme
for
me
this
is
something
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
in
multiples
dreally
really
easy
drinking
delcious
and
complex
porter
ill
be
sure
to
revisit
this
one
the
beer
had
a
slightly
lighter
medium
feel
to
it
not
heavy
but
not
light
either
and
this
gave
the
beer
very
good
drinkability
very
much
what
i
expected
from
an
englishstyle
porter
and
i
could
have
drank
a
few
more
a
very
good
beer
d
this
beer
smells
much
better
than
it
actually
is
nice
feel
and
good
complexity
but
the
nose
builds
up
the
character
so
much
that
i
feel
like
when
i
actually
get
to
the
beer
its
a
bit
of
a
let
down
still
worth
trying
as
it
is
a
solid
porter
with
a
sweet
twist
that
one
seldom
comes
across
found
at
mcouls
in
greensboro
nc
this
one
shows
a
deep
dark
brown
mohogany
color
with
a
goodly
light
oatmeal
colored
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
nuts
and
molasses
malt
deep
and
delightful
the
flavor
offers
thick
charcoal
nuttiness
and
malt
sweetness
with
clear
grassy
hop
bitterness
this
is
decidedly
midplus
bodied
smooth
with
modest
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
definitely
worth
a
try
a
very
solid
porter
ive
had
this
previously
in
cans
and
remember
the
canned
version
being
just
a
bit
better
especially
in
the
mouthfeel
went
through
a
case
in
a
little
over
a
week
during
christmas
break
ill
have
to
find
more
cans
and
do
a
comparison
porter
one
of
my
favorite
styles
picked
up
this
one
in
a
500
ml
can
lets
give
it
a
whirl
following
the
instructions
on
the
can
im
having
this
one
after
dinner
popping
the
top
this
brew
smells
like
chocolate
and
black
licorice
pours
to
a
jet
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
on
the
taste
there
is
lots
of
well
roasted
malt
some
dark
chocolate
and
a
smooth
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
almost
chewy
but
not
syrupy
finish
is
a
bit
metallic
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
not
as
tasty
as
an
american
porter
in
my
book
but
for
an
english
porter
it
hits
the
mark
very
drinkable
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
khaki
head
the
aroma
is
chocolate
with
some
dark
fruit
roasted
malt
coffee
and
some
english
hops
the
flavor
is
similar
roasted
malts
with
some
earthy
hops
along
with
some
bready
malts
and
sweet
chocolate
not
much
coffee
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
this
is
basically
the
definition
of
english
porter
really
well
done
d
this
could
most
surely
be
an
all
nighter
cant
complain
about
the
drinkability
factor
either
goes
down
real
smooth
i
would
certainly
have
another
or
two
or
three
maybe
a
bit
heavy
for
a
session
but
hey
id
rather
sip
and
enjoy
this
one
slow
anyways
man
this
stuff
is
tasty
i
was
excited
about
trying
this
beer
and
it
really
lived
up
to
the
hype
d
not
nearly
the
best
porter
ive
ever
had
definitely
prefer
the
esb
and
the
1845
to
this
overall
a
good
english
brew
drinkability
the
first
beer
was
somewhat
rough
as
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
chocolate
but
the
beer
definitely
improved
as
i
worked
on
the
2nd
and
3rd
a
good
6pack
beer
for
the
night
if
your
looking
for
something
with
a
little
more
love
put
into
it
dvery
drinkable
and
could
be
a
favorite
with
any
beef
influenced
meal
mine
waas
with
a
pot
roast
and
a
very
good
pairing
in
my
mouth
cheers
carbonation
is
perfect
with
a
smooth
if
slightly
thin
body
drinks
very
easily
would
be
happy
to
spend
an
evening
with
this
one
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
porter
should
be
definitely
worth
seeking
out
fullers
london
porter
is
an
icon
so
its
no
surprise
it
is
a
good
beer
i
have
to
admit
that
i
dont
love
it
but
i
do
like
it
d
very
easy
and
smooth
going
down
tasty
as
hell
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
to
porter
lovers
well
balanced
between
roasted
grain
chocolate
and
mild
coffee
smooth
mouthfeel
that
could
use
a
bit
more
umph
easy
to
drink
easy
to
session
nice
all
around
beer
but
it
lacks
the
wow
factor
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
good
head
retention
with
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
starts
with
coffee
and
the
roasted
malt
and
i
can
notice
the
chocolate
a
bit
more
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
also
some
sweetness
of
almost
a
caramel
flavour
too
this
feels
almost
as
smooth
as
a
glass
of
milk
i
frequently
go
back
to
this
as
it
is
the
porter
to
which
i
judge
all
others
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
but
had
a
very
quick
dissipating
head
and
remained
nonexistent
for
the
life
of
the
beer
additionally
there
was
very
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
that
of
roasted
chocolate
a
hint
of
espresso
and
malts
the
initial
taste
of
the
beer
is
that
of
burntroasted
chocolate
paving
the
way
for
the
coffee
espresso
and
roastedburnt
caramel
malt
the
carbonation
in
this
brew
seems
weak
and
barely
any
bubbles
are
seen
half
way
through
drinking
this
beer
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
beer
i
will
purchase
again
notes
nice
drinkable
porter
that
has
a
good
balance
of
flavors
a
very
nice
example
of
a
porter
not
an
amazing
beer
but
a
solid
choice
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
an
excellent
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
really
nice
flavor
just
a
fantastic
english
porter
everything
reminded
me
of
very
rustic
elements
but
in
a
very
good
way
almost
nostalgic
i
could
drink
this
beer
forever
medium
bodied
but
enough
prickly
carbonation
to
keep
this
from
being
overly
cloying
or
even
mouth
coating
drinks
lighter
than
it
is
and
is
very
easy
to
put
down
nothing
overdone
or
out
of
balance
on
this
one
and
no
off
flavors
at
all
another
one
of
those
beers
that
makes
you
wonder
why
you
dont
drink
this
more
often
too
much
choice
out
there
i
guess
a
good
reminder
that
this
beer
needs
to
get
revisited
often
mouthfeel
appropriate
for
the
style
quite
drinkable
blackish
brown
in
colour
with
sharp
ruby
hues
a
finger
of
tan
head
and
dots
of
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
raisins
toffee
cream
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
that
resembles
an
english
pale
burnt
grains
and
ash
in
the
finish
very
subtle
after
a
few
sips
i
get
some
nuts
and
molasses
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
rich
smooth
and
chocolaty
on
the
full
side
of
mediumbodied
this
has
much
less
dryness
and
roast
than
your
typical
porter
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
a
tasty
drinker
from
a
brewer
that
never
disappoints
d
very
drinkable
but
it
gets
kind
of
gluey
and
metallic
in
the
late
stages
of
aftertaste
d
this
is
a
superb
brew
on
any
occasion
drinkability
a
very
nice
session
brew
its
not
to
heavy
but
not
to
light
either
its
certainly
up
there
with
some
of
my
favorite
porters
its
a
boat
load
more
complex
then
the
taddy
porter
but
there
is
something
about
the
extreme
drinkability
of
the
taddy
that
brings
me
back
to
that
too
but
this
is
what
i
would
go
for
if
i
was
something
a
little
more
complex
to
sip
a
little
slower
a
fine
offering
from
a
fantastic
brewery
the
roasted
barley
tastes
are
first
and
foremost
in
the
taste
fairly
sweet
with
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
roast
a
bit
of
a
coffee
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
just
a
little
harsh
for
the
style
imo
sweet
mediumbodied
and
ridiculously
smooth
this
porter
is
delightfully
drinkable
d
not
the
best
tasting
porter
ive
ever
had
but
the
smoothness
of
the
cask
version
is
simply
put
amazing
give
this
one
a
try
regardless
but
especially
if
you
have
a
chance
to
taste
the
cask
version
d
this
is
a
beer
that
you
dont
mind
having
another
of
i
went
through
a
fullerssammy
smithyoungs
kick
a
few
years
back
i
remembered
that
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
but
damn
i
love
taddy
porter
but
this
has
to
be
the
best
english
porter
out
there
a
layer
of
caramel
over
a
layer
of
cocoa
atop
a
layer
of
roasted
pecans
nice
fruity
bitterness
on
the
finish
all
the
creamy
smooth
deliciousness
you
could
ask
for
in
a
beer
a
liquid
lesson
in
beer
history
overall
i
can
see
why
this
receives
the
top
rating
it
does
on
ba
for
an
english
ale
its
intense
yet
balanced
without
being
too
overpowering
i
could
consume
at
least
three
of
these
in
a
row
and
probably
come
back
for
a
fourth
or
fifth
a
highly
sessionable
and
complex
beer
cheers
fullers
better
head
than
the
bottle
good
dark
brown
colour
abundant
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
strong
dark
chocolate
backbone
a
little
coffee
behind
the
chocolate
with
even
less
caramel
notes
in
the
far
back
the
taste
is
a
close
version
of
the
nose
initial
notes
are
coffee
and
some
maltiness
there
is
also
some
caramilzed
sweetness
in
the
elusive
midground
currently
my
favourite
english
dark
ale
hope
it
comes
in
cask
somewhere
nearby
dark
clear
rosewood
with
amber
highlights
and
a
whipped
dense
head
of
fine
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
silky
sheets
of
blonde
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
roasty
and
rich
with
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
bean
nice
roasted
malty
flavors
with
cocoa
and
black
coffee
silky
smooth
and
medium
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
by
far
the
best
pub
can
offering
ive
ever
had
dpretty
drinkable
very
strong
taste
not
too
heavy
definately
sessionable
and
while
it
seems
a
bit
light
in
the
mouth
it
is
as
the
bottle
says
rich
complex
and
dark
and
not
over
the
top
d
not
my
favourite
style
of
beer
but
i
still
found
it
pretty
drinkable
d
not
bad
i
prefer
the
non
nitro
version
to
this
this
is
good
but
just
not
that
great
tasty
none
the
less
d
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
even
a
worldclass
english
porter
not
that
im
saying
anything
new
about
the
beer
id
love
to
be
able
to
get
this
on
cask
one
day
drinkability
this
is
one
smooth
delicious
porter
i
will
have
to
find
a
regular
source
for
this
as
it
is
simply
wonderful
the
body
is
moderate
to
light
would
like
a
touch
more
depth
but
still
good
overall
the
black
marker
thing
is
off
setting
i
know
i
am
sensitive
to
it
so
leave
it
at
that
it
felt
thin
and
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
good
not
all
that
noteworthy
just
a
plain
old
porter
certainly
drinkable
not
bad
not
good
and
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
an
english
pub
and
this
was
on
cask
i
would
probably
order
a
pint
to
see
otherwise
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
notes
i
had
a
4
oz
sample
of
this
at
a
beerfest
awhile
back
which
really
blew
me
away
it
doesnt
seem
as
amazing
having
a
full
bottle
of
it
but
i
can
still
see
why
its
a
benchmark
for
english
porters
i
think
my
sample
was
from
a
nitrocan
ill
have
to
check
this
beer
out
in
that
format
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
even
for
someone
like
me
whod
much
rather
have
two
ipas
back
to
back
rather
than
two
porters
or
stouts
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
will
be
returning
to
in
the
future
i
could
drink
these
all
night
d
a
good
drinkable
beer
d
its
tasty
but
i
dont
find
this
to
be
all
that
special
molasses
or
rasiny
color
with
a
very
moderate
and
short
lived
head
fizzles
away
rather
quickly
leaving
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
roasted
and
a
tad
bit
sour
lots
of
dark
malts
in
there
flavor
is
also
well
roasted
slightly
sour
almost
in
a
dark
chocolate
way
stands
well
on
its
own
or
would
certainly
go
well
with
any
red
meat
lasting
aftertaste
and
lighter
body
than
one
would
imagine
d
im
having
trouble
finding
places
to
mark
down
with
this
beer
this
is
a
drinkable
well
balanced
delightful
beer
drinkability
is
high
an
exceptional
sample
d
this
would
go
great
with
a
whiskey
marinaded
beef
dish
a
chocolate
tort
or
plate
of
bittersweet
chocolates
and
is
very
serviceable
on
its
own
a
very
rich
and
malty
brew
and
at

classic

is
a
little
too
much
on
the

side
roasty

notes

in
the

theres
a

note
the
coffee
element
is

house
feel
is
smooth
and
slick
the
sweetness
borders
on
unpleasant
though
didnt
really
want
to

with
a
fresher

i
find

london
porter
is
a
dark
brown
ale
with
a
cappucino
colored
head
that
leaves
foam
all
over
the
glass
it
has
an
aroma
like
toffee
but
not
too
sweet
it
smells
roasty
like
chocolate
coffee
and
baked
goods
heres
an
earthy
twang
to
it
thats
unambiguously

really
its
chocolatey
and
slightly
bitter
its
perfectly
balanced
its
a
bit
grassy
and
almost
umami
very
classic
very
drinkable
one
of
the
few
solid
choices
available
at
my
hometown
rural
northern
ontario
lcbo
will
likely
be
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
over
the
next
few
weeks
of
christmas
holidays
d
very
drinkable
flavorful
enough
to
be
interesting
but
not
overpowering
or
cloying
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
intro
beer
for
people
whove
never
had
a
porter
or
a
really
dark
beer
but
its
still
good
enough
to
satisfy
an
experienced
beer
geek
i
might
pick
myself
up
a
sixpack
if
i
ever
spot
one
no
reason
not
to
drink
this
beer

my
wife
is
not
the
biggest
porter
fan
and
she
loved
it
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
porters
and
still
my
personal
benchmark
for
english
porters
the
overt
chocolate
character
just
cant
be
beat
i
like
this
beer
and
i
want
to
love
it
but
it
just
seems
slightly
too
much
on
the
roastiness
over
a
prolonged
period
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
and
would
recommend
it
to
friends
but
the
lighter
body
mixed
with
the
heavy
coffeeburnt
flavors
keep
it
a
notch
below
excellence
for
me
dsuperb
d
full
of
flavors
smells
and
textures
but
highly
drinkable
serve
this
at
the
suggested
temperature
as
all
the

really
opens
up
good

smooth
virtually
carbonation
slightly

highly
drinkable
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
and
am
finally
reviewing
it
definitely
shows
a
great
example
of
a
superior
english
porter
a
little
less
burnt
and
roasty
than
the
american
style
i
am
used
to
sweeter
as
well
a
lactic
presence
chocolate
outweighs
the
coffee
but
there
is
some
bitter
coffee
towards
the
end
and
in
the
aftertaste
maybe
even
a
small
amount
of
dark
fruit
mixed
in
there
dont
hesitate
on
this
one
along
with
sierra
nevadas
porter
this
ranks
as
one
of
my
favorites
immensely
quaffable
and
interesting
this
is
ideal
for
any
season
overall
a
full
flavored
and
full
bodied
porter
excellent
porter
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
quite
a
spell
ill
be
on
the
hunt
for
another
bottle
here
in
the
states
to
see
if
this
is
really
as
good
as
i
recall
or
if
the
esb
soccer
had
clouded
my
good
judgment
d
a
very
nice
porter
sessionably
quaffable
ive
had
this
from
a
regular
tap
and
bottle
but
really
enjoy
it
from
the
nitrocan
best
better
yet
ill
search
for
it
on

what
an

ought
to
be
rich

roasted

aroma
moderate
abv
that
makes
having
a

almost
requisite
alas
i
have
but
one
recommended
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
with
poor
retention
smells
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
with
hints
of
molasses
present
medium
mouthfeel

very
good

of
how

really
enjoyed
this
although

anything
wrong

very
sessionable
and
drinkable
maybe
one
of
the
best
roasted

youll
ever
find
very
classy
beer
and
very
well
balanced
d
yes
very
much
f

not
too
long

the
creamy
chocolate
hangs
around
at
any
part
of
the

it
can
hide
stays
light
on

and
bitterness
but
has
a
nice
stouty
taste
light

rich

great
as

for

a

of
these

if
you
like
dark
stuff
and
even
if
you
dont
then
youll
probably
find
new
enlightenment
from
this
beer
overall
a
solid
offering
from
fullers
as
stated
on
the
can
this
is
an
excellent
afterdinner
drink
nothing
is
too
overpowering
making
this
a
pleasant
porter
to
drink
d
very
good
porter
and
another
very
good
beer
from
fullers
very
drinkable
and
good
perfect
for
the
style
which
more
american
portersstouts
were
like
this
md
very
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
palate
not
too
heavy
really
drinkable
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
is
interesting
since
it
has
pretty
strong
flavors
d
well
i
did
an
unusual
thing
for
me
and
had
a
second
glass
of
the
same
beer
nuff
said
highly
drinkable
porter
i
had
it
bottled
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
clear
where
theres
opacity
with
an
opaque
center
a
dense
two
finger
nitro
head
tops
the
dark
body
the
nose
is
subdued
but
pleasant
milk
chocolate
and
nougat
burnt
toast
and
light
fruitiness
the
taste
is
much
bolder
though
still
mellow
opening
with
a
pleasant
chocolate
and
toffee
sweetness
leading
into
a
surprisingly
dry
bitter
and
roasty
fnish
mediumbodied
nearly
flat
in
the
usual
nitrotap
fashion
but
quite
creamy
i
put
down
a
couple
pints
of
this
in
less
than
an
hour
and
couldve
gone
for
another
time
permitting
one
of
my
favorite
english
porters
id
love
to
try
this
on
hand
pump
some
time
i
love
porters
and
this
is
a
goodun
this
beer
pours
a
dark
browncherry
colour
with

highlights
and
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
with
sporadic
lacingthe

very
niceit
has
above
average
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
smooth
thinnish
mocha
start
that
finishes
with
a
little
dose
of
hops
but
not
bitter
at
all
once
again
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
so
perfectly
balanced
out
i
can
see
why
this
was
the
drink
of
choice
all
those
years
ago
and
would
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
like
a
nice
uk
porter
drinkability
an
understandable
classic
the
taste
and
the
feel
of
this
porter
are
world
class
and
the
potency
and
fullness
of
the
flavours
at
just
5
4
abv
are
phenomenal
the
easy
in
which
it
goes
down
is
a
worry
like
most
good
beers
are
an
aggressive
pour
leaves
me
with
a
thin
layer
of
tan
head
over
a
black
body
the
body
shows
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
it
has
a
deep
roasted
malt
aroma
of
chocolate
and
coffee
it
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
black
coffee
and
blackstrap
molasses
bittersweet
finishes
long
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
dark
roast
coffee
medium
bodied
with
almost
flat
carbonation
very
smooth
and
creamy
its
substantial
but
not
overly
heavy
i
could
drink
a
few
of
this
delicious
english
porter
and
would
be
more
than
happy
doing
so
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
rich
yet
refreshing
and
oh
so
easy
to
drink
on
tap
at
the
elephant
castle
in
boston
served
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
dark
rich
brown
color
thin
white
head
roasted
dark
chocolate
malt
smell
taste
nailed
what
i
think
a
porter
should
be
roasted
malt
cocoa
licorice
hint
of
vanilla
and
just
a
bit
of
smoke
all
rolled
onto
the
palate
i
loved
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
smooth
and
creamy
yet
hearty
at
the
same
time
but
very
drinkable
and
a
moderate
abv
level
this
should
be
considered
a
classic
example
of
a
british
porter
drink
if
you
want
flavor
specifically
smoky
rich
flavors
this
is
one
excellent
porter
i
can
definitely
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
at
the
pub
simply
a
wonderfully
complex
beerexceptional
id
drink
this
beer
over
and
over
again
a
beer
you
should
buy
although
its
a
bit
pricey
drinkability
great
i
would
rather
drink
this
beer
then
some
light
pales
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
this
is
so
drinkable
i
cant
believe
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
whole
sixer
of
this
please
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
yet
go
get
it
for
real
you
wont
be
dissapointed
this
beer
is
exemplary
in
questioning
the
notion
of
drinkability
would
you
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
like
any
porter
probably
not
would
i
want
to
yes
will
i
buy
more
hell
yes
i
am
excited
to
try
this
beer
again
and
sample
more
from
the
fuller
stable
overall
a
great
beer
ive
had
others
of
the
same
style
that
perhaps
have
a
bit
more
character
but
this
is
amongst
the
most
balanced
and
drinkable
porters
that
ive
had
id
recommend
it
as
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
d
good
english
stuff
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
came
off
a
little
light
and
felt
a
bit
watered
down
started
off
creamy
but
the
carbonation
completely
disappeared
by
about
halfway
through
altogether
this
was
a
very
good
porter
the
initial
aroma
was
very
pleasing
and
my
only
real
complaint
about
this
one
was
the
mouthfeel
being
a
little
too
light
d
the
smoothness
and
low
carbonation
make
this
an
easy
one
to
quaff
i
miss
my
beer
drinking
friend
a
great
deal
its
just
not
the
same

of
flavour
yet
light
how
can
this
be
super
smooth
and
absolutely
poundable
a
near
perfect
example
of
the
cask
delivered
english
porter
this
is
my
benchmark
a
creamy
texture
despite
a
relatively
watery
body
for
a
porter
low
abv
of
5
4
for
an
english
porter
drinks
well
but
a
little
too
lightbodied
has
a
nice
balance
and
a
little
cherry
and
plum
on
the
back
end
which
combined
with
the
minimal
carbonation
make
the
beer
a
touch
sour
but
finishes
well
d
good
overall
i
did
feel
this
beer
was
quite
drinkable
for
a
multitude
of
reasons
although
there
was
definitely
room
for
improvement
i
would
happily
enjoy
another
and
hope
to
have
one
in
its
homeland
sometime
in
the
near
future
this
porter
is
easy
to
drink
and
somewhat
lightish
bodied
but
still
has
a
velvety
creamy
fullflavored
texture
great
balance
of
sweet
roasty
malts
and
toasty
and
hop
bitterness
just
a
touch
of
dark
fruitiness
enters
the
palate
as
the
beer
warms
makes
a
great
party
sixer
as
it
never
gets
boring
and
can
easily
be
sipped
or
gulped
all
night
fantastic
well
balanced
beer
this
ale
is
expensive
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
i
will
buy
this
one
repeatedly
d
i
like
porters
this
one
falls
toward
the
middle
of
my
list
of
favorites
i
say
that
because
it
didnt
blow
me
away
i
would
drink
it
again
over
and
over
carbonation
is
abundant
but
not
overdone
the
bubbles
are
small
and
prickly
and
together
with
the
sweet
malty
flavor
they
make
for
a
soft
velvety
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
little
different
great
take
on
a
great
beer
style
d
fortunately
the
roast
malt
finish
is
fleeting
otherwise
this
would
be
an
oppressive
beer
as
it
is
there
is
no
lingering
bitterness
making
this
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
d
highly
enjoyable
porter
that
doesnt
try
to
do
too
much
picks
a
classic
style
and
executes
to
perfection
simple
flavors
and
low
abv
make
it
easy
to
order
another
very
good
drinkability
in
that
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
but
it
isnt
overwhelming
very
enjoyable
porter
d
drinking
a
500ml
can
is
no
problem
the
roastiness
never
gets
out
of
hand
and
the
abv
is
pretty
forgiving
this
is
one
of
the
best
options
that
is
always
available
at
the
lcbo
d
easy
drinking
beer
flavors
are
well
integrated
and
not
overbearing
abv
is
manageable
roasted
malts
due
become
a
bit
tiring
this
is
simply
an
outstandin
porter
however
you
have
it
drinkability
is
high
the
abv
is
easily
managed
making
for
a
more
sessionable
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
quite
nice
as
well
making
it
easy
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
british
pint
cant
believe
i
let
this
sit
on
the
store
shelf
so
long
before
taking
one
of
my
own
home
d
in
my
book
porters
should
have
the
malty
flavors
of
a
stout
with
the
drinkability
of
a
pale
ale
fullers
london
porter
has
both
and
drinks
easier
than
your
average
pale
ale
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
flavorful
beer
that
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
again
taste
is
really
out
of
this
world
rich
with
chocolate
and
real
ale
taste
but
not
fruity
like
a
lot
of
other
american
porters
which
keeps
it
a
little
more
quaffable
and
unique
not
overly
bitter
at
any
point
during
the
beer
from
either
hops
or
roasted
malt
just
amazing
balance
dthis
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
its
solid
but
i
dont
really
care
to
have
any
more
d
this
is
a
session
beer
i
could
sit
down
to
several
pints
of
this
easily
tasty
and
downright
quaffable
this
is
may
be
the
best
porter
i
have
tried
this
next
to
a
samuel
smiths
would
be
interesting
that
said
its
a
great
beer
and
i
guess
sometimes
not
having
much
to
say
about
a
beer
is
a
good
thing
pours
a
very
dark
brown
there
is
very
little
head
on
it
dispite
my
hard
pour
felt
little
bit
of
a
let
down
i
do
remember
this
having
a
bigger
head
on
draft
so
maybe
it
was
something
in
the
bottle
or
perhaps
i
poured
it
shitty
smells
like
coffee
and
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
tastes
very
strongly
of
roasted
flavors
coffee
like
bitterness
and
very
dark
chocolate
these
mix
with
a
very
strong
metallicearthy
hop
flavor
to
make
a
very
interesting
porter
this
is
definitely
something
to
have
again
went
very
well
on
a
rainy
day
pours
a
deep
brown
that
has
mahogany
edges
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
aroma
is
full
of
milk
chocolate
vanilla
and
a
dash
of
coffee
the
flavor
has
dark
chocolate
cocoa
nibs
some
coffee
and
nuttiness
but
its
smooth
its
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
is
slightly
chewy
but
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
this
is
a
classy
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
would
love
to
try
this
ontap
recommended
to
me
by
men
online
very
pleasing
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
beer
or
style
of
beer
very
smokey
london
porters
a
very
solid
english
porter
if
youre
looking
for
a
pretty
flavorful
beer
thats
easy
to
toss
back
youve
come
to
the
right
place
to
be
honest
its
not
quite
as
good
as
i
expected
i
anticipated
more
flavor
depth
and
character
but
its
a
pretty
well
put
together
beer
for
the
style
perhaps
im
just
not
the
biggest
english
porter
fan
well
worth
checking
out
in
any
event
d
i
was
surprised
at
the
differences
between
the
canned
and
bottled
versions
of
this
beer
both
are
great
porters
relatively
low
abv
makes
it
easy
to
have
another
i
will
be
visiting
this
again
the
complexity
really
isnt
there
but
hint
of
smoke
molasses
earthy
and
floral
hops
are
enough
to
keep
me
interested
and
the
dry
husky
finish
keeps
it
drinkable
solid
effort
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
stellar
beer
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
deep
dark
chestnut
color
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
ecru
foam
that
lingers
for
a
bit
leaving
behind
minimal
lacing
a
great
looking
poursorry
i
drink
with
my
eyes
first
and
foremost
smells
and
tastes
of
milk
chocolate
bittersweet
cocoa
frsh
rich
coffee
beans
and
caramelized
malts
nice
a
notch
or
two
above
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
every
lover
of
porters
needs
to
check
this
one
out
pouring
into
a
pint
glass
results
in
a
jet
black
ale
with
a
bit
of
head
that
evaporates
quickly
leaving
minor
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
very
slight
but
contains
some
mocha
hints
taste
starts
out
bitter
with
some
medium
roasted
coffee
flavor
but
evolves
into
more
chocolaty
than
coffee
flavor
slightly
dry
but
very
drinkable
overall
i
would
probably
save
it
for
after
a
meal
instead
of
a
complement
to
one
like
a
postdinner
coffee
or
chocolate
mdmouthfeels
ultra
smooth
and
creamy
mediumbodied
the
flavors
are
big
so
the
drinkability
gets
cut
down
a
bit
but
a
couple
pints
of
this
are
like
nothing
try
it
with
dessert
as
i
didyou
wont
be
disappointed
poured
a
deep
brownblack
color
completely
opaque
tons
of
burnt
coffee
aroma
eminating
from
the
glass
little
to
no
head
no
lacing
present
very
little
carbonation
to
speak
of
but
i
suppose
thats
to
style
this
beer
as
a
pretty
decent
body
and
goes
down
smooth
of
all
the
porters
ive
tried
this
is
about
middle
ground
very
drinkable
due
to
low
abv
and
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
happily
dark
brown
almost
black
large
two
finger
light
tan
head
some
sheet
lacings
aroma
is
cocoa
malts
taste
is
burnt
brown
sugar
molasses
dark
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
medium
dry
bitter
finish
silky
on
the
tongue
easy
drinker
leaves
you
wanting
more
carbonation
is
minimal
but
that
seems
to
be
typical
for
british
beers
final
thoughts
got
this
one
from
ludachris
all
in
all
quite
good
i
wouldnt
call
it
truly
exceptional
but
for
the
most
part
a
solid
offering
i
can
see
why
my
brother
swears
by
this
stuff
id
like
to
see
instead
of
guinness
on
tap
without
a
doubt
d
in
the
realm
of
a
sessionable
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
the
good
times
rolling
i
probably
will
never
attempt
to
drink
this
from
a
bottle
after
having
it
this
way
smooth
and
silky
with
a
stand
out
roasted
character
to
itself
would
love
to
try
this
with
some
dark
meats
to
go
along
with
it
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
u
k
im
sure
if
you
ask
around
a
lot
of
people
might
tell
you
that
fullers
london
porter
is
what
turned
them
onto
dark
beer
it
certainly
isnt
hard
to
acquire
a
taste
for
gratifying
bittersweet
flavours
like
these
nor
is
it
hard
to
acknowledge
the
fullness
and
satisfaction
you
have
come
an
empty
glass
fullers
calls
their
london
porter
the
worlds
finest
which
may
be
an
exaggeration
but
not
by
much
this
is
a
paragon
for
the
style
a
slick
smooth
as
silk
operator
and
deftly
commendable
as
a
coldweather
sipper
though
worthy
of
a
go
anytime
you
might
come
across
it
i
would
put
forth
d
a
very
good
porter
with
a
wellrounded
nutty
cocoa
flavor
one
of
the
standardbearers
for
the
style
although
others
are
a
lot
more
adventurous
creamy
beige
head
deep
brown
colour
lacing
aroma
is
heavily
roasted
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
brown
sugar
flavour
is
roasted
sweet
and
plenty
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavour
is
very
well
balanced
and
yet
intriguing
mouthfeel
is
very
very
smooth
with
small
bubbles
and
it
is
almost
a
bit
oily
this
is
a
great
porter
met
my
expectations
and
then
some
got
an
11
2
oz
bottle
of
this
for
free
recently
poured
into
my
pint
glass
bottle
has
a
best
by
date
of
march
2006
which
i
did
not
become
aware
of
until
after
the
beer
was
in
my
possession
but
i
figured
what
the
hell
i
am
pretty
sure
that
this
bottle
was
sitting
in
a
fridge
for
most
of
those
3
years
the
yeast
and
carbonation
are
indeed
still
very
active
even
this
3
years
past
the
best
by
date
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
auburn
highlights
the
tan
head
is
about
3
inches
thick
when
pouredl
settling
to
a
good
nice
after
about
5
minutes
good
lacing
head
finally
settles
to
a
good
13
inch
after
a
few
sips
good
staying
power
aromas
of
malty
chocolate
and
coffee
are
certainly
present
along
with
a
sort
of
roasted
nut
aroma
too
brown
nutty
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavor
upfront
giving
way
to
sweeter
chocolate
flavors
not
really
any
hops
maybe
a
slight
trace
at
most
has
a
crisp
but
mainly
smooth
creamy
and
frothy
mouthfeel
that
coasts
your
palate
full
body
with
moderate
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
in
a
good
way
i
was
certainly
impressed
would
be
curious
to
try
a
fresh
batch
if
i
can
find
this
in
my
area
maybe
ill
age
another
bottle
or
two
in
my
fridge
for
3
years
past
the
best
by
date
because
this
was
damn
good
dark
and
opaque
aromas
of
charcoal
smoke
and
black
olives
taste
is
initially
of
chocolate
followed
by
coffee
and
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitter
and
smoky
aftertaste
theres
a
metallic
aftertaste
that
goes
away
after
a
couple
of
sips
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
good
drinkability
although
i
have
had
better
porters
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
surprisingly
pleasant
quite
drinkable
maybe
refreshing
very
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
like
guinness
but
this
is
cheaper
and
much
better
d
not
the
most
complex
ive
had
but
overall
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
very
easy
not
as
filling
as
some
porters
which
makes
it
a
little
more
drinkable
d
quite
a
tasty
porter
and
not
heavy
at
all
definitely
one
you
could
session
what
struck
me
about
the
taste
is
how
much
this
reminded
me
of
the
irish
stouts
i
gather
that
way
way
back
when
guinness
draught
was
their
version
of
porter
so
that
makes
sense
both
brews
have
that
astringent
roasty
flavor
but
where
guinness
tends
toward
a
sour
finish
fullers
goes
to
astringent
bitterness
something
i
associate
with
black
malt
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
but
not
as
rich
or
sweet
as
i
would
like
d
i
could
easily
down
a
few
pints
of
this
in
one
night
an
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
with
the
perfect
balance
of
malty
sweetness
roasted
grains
and
hop
bitterness
an
excellent
beer
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
brew
and
while
it
wasnt
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
it
didnt
measure
up
to
what
i
was
expecting
wow
this
is
a
great
porter
i
have
seen
better
looking
porters
but
the
taste
holy
cow
pours
a
dark
opaque
color
in
the
true
porter
style
head
retention
was
not
high
but
honorable
tastes
of
chocolate
malts
heavy
mouthfeel
full
of
flavor
damn
did
i
mention
this
is
great
smokey
traces
come
through
and
cut
through
the
malts
ends
dry
with
a
touch
of
hops
great
great
porter
d
a
great
porter
something
that
all
that
enjoy
the
dark
beers
should
try
a
reliable
porter
this
beer
will
always
be
a
good
choice
drinkability
another
great
porter
that
is
very
complex
i
could
easily
have
a
six
excellent
drinkability
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
and
a
decent
abv
make
this
brew
a
good
choice
to
pound
all
night
long
this
one
pours
about
as
black
as
a
stout
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
fades
kinda
of
slowly
to
a
thin
frothy
head
that
almost
reminds
me
of
a
nitrogen
conditioned
beer
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
shows
a
dark
dark
brown
color
almost
ruby
the
nose
almost
reminds
me
of
a
guiness
only
way
more
complex
lots
of
coffee
aparent
some
chocolate
and
some
really
nice
roasted
malt
aromas
a
lot
of
the
coffee
and
chocolate
come
through
in
the
taste
with
a
little
roastiness
finishing
with
a
nice
semi
bitter
chocolate
finish
that
leaves
you
longing
for
more
its
medium
bodied
and
not
too
much
carbonation
just
perfect
this
has
some
great
drinkability
both
cause
great
taste
and
average
abv
this
is
the
first
one
from
fullers
that
ive
had
and
i
really
enjoyed
ill
definately
be
picking
up
some
of
their
other
brews
i
highly
suggest
seeking
this
one
out
i
only
wish
that
my
porter
turned
out
have
as
good
drinkability
one
only
this
is
a
treat
i
wouldnt
have
another
until
next
sunday
cheers
oh
to
be
able
to
have
this
one
on
tap
in
the
wintertime
very
very
drinkable
dark
beer
d
a
very
nice
porter
and
one
id
be
happy
to
have
again
ive
come
to
find
that
fullers
tends
to
have
a
knack
for
making
very
nice
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
well
worth
it
very
good
brew
drinkability
good
abv
taste
and
mouthfeel
works
for
me
in
this
category
ontap
at
the
diner
in
adams
morgan
dc
pich
black
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
rich
creamy
head
aroma
is
chocolate
taste
is
cocoacoffee
and
sweet
cream
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
is
one
of
the
top
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
couple
of
years
highly
recommended
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
next
one
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
one
finger
off
white
head
that
dissapates
slowly
leaving
think
lacing
behind
nose
is
smokey
and
dark
roasted
malts
some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
as
well
taste
is
initially
of
smokey
chocolate
and
coffee
there
is
a
slight
hop
undertone
that
gives
some
bitterness
to
the
beer
overall
i
thought
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
slightly
creamy
feel
to
it
this
is
a
great
beer
certainly
one
to
sit
with
for
a
session
sugary
chocolate
taste
as
well
burnt
malt
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
smoothe
an
excellent
porter
this
one
is
my
favorite
porter
at
the
present
time
d
very

too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of

this
is
a
very
good
dark
beer
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
a
blackish
body
with
a
small
tan
head
and
minor
lacings
a
semisweet
malt
smell
with
caramel
notes
and
hints
of
coffee
malt
very
sweet
and
somewhat
creamy
mediumbodied
with
hints
of
toffee
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
all
in
there
and
balances
with
a
dry
satisfying
finish
a
mix
of
roasted
malt
and
hops
despite
a
tad
syrupiness
from
the
beer
i
could
relax
with
a
pint
of
this
anytime
mouthfeel
is
about
as
rich
as
a
beer
can
get
one
of
the
more
creamy
brews
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
try
has
a
pillowy
fluffy
feel
in
the
mouth
if
that
makes
any
sense
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
have
no
problem
downing
a
few
of
these
during
dinner
or
just
relaxing
before
bed
outstanding
brew
simply
a
must
try
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
color
with
a
light
tan

in
the
aroma
roasty
and
a
sweet
oatmeal
malt

taste

smooth

to
light
bodied

dry
roasty

almost
like

all
that

try

pours
a
black
colored
body
with
a
big
tan
head
with
good
lacing
but
diminishing
has
an
extremely
malty
aroma
coffee
notes
very
light
tasting
with
some
bitterness
some
acid
and
coffee
tastes
okay
beer
kind
of
a
session
ale
type
drink
overall
very
pleasant
and
drinkablea
good
session
beer
at
5
4
abv
perfect
to
have
on
a
cold
wet
january
dayor
any
other
day
overall
the
beer
doesnt
have
the
burnt
sugar
or
harsh
notes
to
it
the
roasted
malt
seems
held
back
a
bit
to
allow
for
a
very
smooth
beer
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
a
velvety
mouth
feel
that
slightly
astringent
the
beer
gives
of
a
nice
complex
character
but
in
a
refined
english
way
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
allowing
the
drinker
to
find
the
hops
that
is
hidden
in
this
beer
a
very
well
made
and
on
point
with
its
style
there
are
a
few
character
flaws
in
the
beer
i
feel
could
be
a
bit
better
probably
from
shipping
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
session
went
well
with
my
steak
dinner
full
bodied
with
moderate
drinkability
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
after
diner
beer
with
a
slice
of
chocolate
cheese
cake
or
the
classic
king
dong
overall
this
is
the
paradigm
porter
simply
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
ever
had
rich
tasty
roasty
and
lightly
nutty
everything
a
good
english
porter
needs
and
everything
a
good
english
porter
has
if
there
was
a
standard
of
porter
brewing
this
would
be
it
cheers
having
finished
23
of
the
beer
for
the
review
im
now
enjoying
this
with
a
porter
chedder
from
ireland
d
would
certainly
be
a
great
session
brew
drinkable
tasty
with
no
real
glaring
flaws
poured
a
deep
brown
color
borderline
black
smooth
light
tan
elegant
looking
head
nice
retention
some
lacings
sticking
to
the
glass
toasted
malts
and
cookie
dough
on
the
nose
rich
and
creamy
some
toasted
malts
mocha
milky
way
bar
with
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
nice
complex
rendition
of
a
porter
this
is
probably
if
not
the
best
porter
out
there
d
i
like
the
flavor
and
i
could
pound
a
few
of
these
back
especially
during
the
winter
a
very
heavy
beer
though
d
acceptable
evening
sipping
beer
goes
down
easily
but
is
a
little
to
mild
in
character
ah
a
wonderful
porter
i
just
wish
places
still
had
it
on
draught
again
ahem
cornwalls
the
bottle
pours
out
a
dark
near
black
brown
with
minimal
head
that
holds
onto
its
retention
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
what
you
expect
chocolatecoffeelicorice
with
a
sharp
alcohol
nose
the
flavor
likewise
incorporates
the
above
with
a
bit
of
hops
malt
and
a
carbonation
that
lets
the
alcohol
linger
the
taste
turns
from
the
sweeter
components
to
a
more
bitter
flavor
that
rests
nicely
throughout
your
mouth
and
in
particular
on
the
sides
of
your
tongue
i
just
to
sit
in
a
pub
with
a
fire
going
then
all
would
be
fine
slim
custom
bottle
poured
into
my
duvel
glass
this
beer
pours
a
real
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
small
tan
head
smells
of
coffee
fruit
and
the
black
patent
and
roasted
barley
really
come
through
the
taste
is
very
complex
as
the
bottle
suggests
tastes
sweet
at
the
beginning
and
is
bitter
at
the
end
with
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
with
nice
carbonated
drinkability
is
high
and
is
limited
only
by
the
high
price
tag
overall
this
is
a
superyummy
very
drinkable
porter
bottle
and
nitrotap
altough
im
not
a
huge
porter
fan
id
call
this
a
classic
always
a
good
choice
and
my
favourite
porter
serving
type
bottle
500
drinkability
is
wonderful
too
you
can
put
down
a
handful
of
these
d
a
great
beer
the
abv
is
a
little
low
remember
me
a
homebrew
i
did
some
months
ago
thumbs
up
easy
example
of
the
porter
style
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
foamy
beige
head
aroma
of
rosted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
very
similar
to
aroma
with
malty
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
creamy
and
smooth
up
front
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
a
good
afterdinner
drink
great
for
sipping
a
serious
beer
complicated
enough
to
sip
thoughtfully
midfull
body
pretty
smooth
good
carbonation
i
dig
this
beer
verdict
an
above
average
porter
this
is
something
id
surely
recommend
for
someone
looking
for
a
good
easily
available
example
of
the
style
rich
but
wellbalanced
this
beer
is
a
complex
treat
and
worthy
of
its
reputation
on
tap
at
pipers
pub
pittsburgh
pa
d
seems
very
drinkable
the
low
abv
and
light
mouthfeel
helps
here
hightly
recommended
even
for
nonporter
fans
this
ale
is
a
very
dark
reddishbrown
almost
black
in
color
with
a
medium
pour
the
head
is
dark
brown
dense
and
about
5
inches
tall
smell
is
of
vanilla
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
roasted
chocolate
flavor
a
hint
of
coffee
too
the
english
yeast
strain
imparts
a
slightly
fruity
buttery
flavor
in
the
finish
is
a
nice
earthy
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
slightly
high
carbonation
fantastically
drinkable
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
another
great
one
from
fullers
i
dont
think
they
are
able
to
create
anything
short
of
exceptional
beer
i
am
still
looking
for
my
first
5
where
can
it
be
surly
darkness
maybe
we
will
have
to
wait
and
see
overall
excellent
though
for
me
it
doesnt
quite
beat
the
amazing
colonial
gully
washer
winter
ale
which
has
been
renamed
colonial
porter
and
has
apparently
deteriorated
in
quality
since
i
last
tried
it
d
this
is
an
excellent
drinking
porter
d
this
is
what
ive
always
perceived
a
true
english
should
be
very
rich
and
flavorful
cheers
wow

an

in

with
some

i
know
an
irish
pubin
boston
for
lunch
during
the
work

and
noticed
this
gem
on

ordered
it
up
had
a
spirited
round
of

very

this
is
an
absolute

easy
to
drink
for
such
a
tasty
beer
one
of
the
greatest
porters
out
there
slightly

explained
not
as

than
the

a
great
can
alternative
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
fullbodied
pretty
decent
drinkability
overall
in
dark
beers
ill
go
for
a
brown
ale
for
something
malty
and
nutty
a
stout
for
something
rich
and
smooth
and
a
porter
for
something
sweeter
and
warming
this
is
clearly
a
quality
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
hit
any
of
those
marks
its
sort
of
a
porter
crossed
with
a
red
ale
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again

overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
porter
its
a
well
made
beer
and
easy
to
drink
similar
notes
appear
on
the
tongue
dominated
mostly
by
bitter
burnt
flavors
light
in
body
with
a
rather
refreshing
middling
bitterness
that
lingers
afterward
in
the
finish
leaving
me
wishing
for
another
pours
a
deep
obsidian
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
enticing
aroma
and
similar
taste
of
roasted
malt
and
bittersweet
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
overall
not
a
problem
a
fine
english
porter
that
i
will
come
back
to
without
question
d
really
good
drinkability
rich
and
dark
with
a
fresh
roasted
coffee
flavor
that
is
sure
to
put
this
on
the
top
of
your
list
per
style
the
aroma
is
a
deep
dark
roasted
espresso
bean
that
is
nearly
burnt
awesome
there
are
also
faint
malt
and
caramel
whiffs
here
when
i
drank
this
there
was
again
espresso
but
with
chocolate
and
hints
of
malt
nice
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
was
perfect
with
a
great
crisp
after
taste
nice
thick
mouthfeel
thats
chewy
and
refreshing
a
great
example
of
a
great
porter
yummy
d
it
might
have
been
because
it
has
been
a
week
since
i
have
had
a
beer
but
when
i
took
the
first
sip
of
this
it
was
freaking
amazing
the
uniqueness
seemed
to
subside
a
little
as
i
continued
to
drink
not
sure
if
my
taste
buds
were
just
adapting
or
what
definitely
a
great
porter
i
will
have
to
try
this
one
again
thanks
to
ba
for
a
great
recommendation
picked
this
up
at
perfect
pour
columbia
and
couldnt
wait
to
try
it
porters
are
a
favorite
style
and
this
was
no
exception
deep
rich
brownblack
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
head
rich
smoky
malt
in
the
nose
and
in
the
initial
taste
a
subtle
pleasing
sweetness
follows
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
well
worth
finding
and
trying
this
one
this
beer
may
be
black
as
night
but
the
bitterness
makes
it
surprisingly
refreshing
very
drinkable
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
im
glad
is
finally
available
in
texas
again
i
really
like
porters
in
the
cooler
months
and
could
see
this
one
being
part
of
that
rotation
fullers
london
porter
pours
a
medium
dense
dark
ebony
with
a
short
lasting
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
good
but
only
moderately
strong
taste
has
similar
characteristics
its
a
fair
tasting
porter
but
there
isnt
any
boldness
to
the
taste
notable
charactieristics
include
a
smooth
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
smokeyness
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
overall
drinkability
was
good
but
i
though
this
could
have
been
a
lot
bolder
in
just
about
every
aspect
if
this
was
a
reasonably
priced
six
pack
id
say
its
worth
picking
up
but
for
what
they
are
charging
the
quality
is
not
worth
the
price
very
good
stuff
its
hard
to
say
whether
i
like
this
one
of
the
taddy
porter
more
they
are
distinctly
different
however
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
some
of
this
it
seems
to
have
been
eluding
me
for
quite
some
time
then
i
would
highly
recommend
doing
so
d
definitely
a
good
porter
but
with
a
few
minor
shortcomings
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
less
carbonation
however
i
was
totally
intrigued
by
the
mild
smokiness
of
this
beer
mediumbodied
with
superb
carbonation
and
feel
outstanding
drinkability
d
definitely
drinkable
not
too
much
on
the
coffee
or
chocolate
notes
in
the
taste
i
can
definitely
see
myself
having
this
brew
again
definitely
a
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
not
too
different
from
the
nonnitro
canned
version
it
seems
maybe
less
pronounced
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
and
overall
sweeter
but
still
just
as
good
perhaps
the
nitro
also
helps
with
smoothness
but
not
so
much
that
it
really
ups
the
score
any
bit
further
pours
a
nice
foamy
kakhi
head
into
english
pint
one
finger
which
dissapears
quickly
nice
deep
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
a
delicious
aroma
of
coffee
and
bready
malts
and
a
flavor
which
delivers
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
a
beer
which
rolls
across
the
tongue
leaving
a
smile
on
the
face
quickly
inviting
another
sip
to
identify
a
characteristic
you
missed
complex
enough
to
try
again
and
again
this
beer
had
a
deliciously
creamy
head
on
it
with
a
nice
dark
body
smell
was
pleasant
could
definitely
detect
a
hop
presence
more
so
than
the
malts
at
least
in
my
opinion
the
taste
had
the
presence
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
finish
was
superb
a
very
subtle
diacetyl
presence
along
with
a
toffeelike
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
a
fantastic
example
of
a
true
porter
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
in
color
almost
opaque
nice
white
head
carbonation
is
hard
to
tell
but
i
think
its
in
there
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
licorice
and
slightly
toasted
bread
the
taste
has
some
plum
pudding
notes
and
then
nice
roated
character
the
malt
is
the
backbone
of
the
brew
the
body
is
medium
and
not
too
heavy
there
is
a
coating
of
sweetness
throughout
the
entire
session
and
an
overall
great
beer
dthis
is
an
excellent
porter
and
may
very
well
be
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
something
even
at
12
50
a
six
id
be
willing
to
pay

dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
white
head
light
malty
aroma
first
taste
is
nice
with
a
solid
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavours
nice
roasty
aftertaste
the
canned
version
recently
fared
poorly
at
a
blind
porter
and
stout
tasting
at
cest
what
but
its
competition
was
against
mainly
draught
offerings
hell
i
could
drink
this
for
breakfast
fullers
london
porter
is
a
fine
beer
indeed
porters
and
stouts
arent
my
prefered
type
of
beers
but
i
found
this
one
an
excellent
beer
its
apperence
is
almost
black
and
smell
is
sweet
and
coffee
likeand
tasted
liked
it
smelt
with
the
beers
body
nice
and
smooth
another
great
beer
from
the
almighty
fullers
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
back
cola
color
with
a
ruby
hue
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
pretty
standard
sweet
smell
of
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
where
this
thing
is
at
one
of
the
tastiest
porters
i
have
ever
hard
very
straight
foward
on
the
flavors
of
strong
coffee
espresso
dark
chocolate
with
a
nice
bitter
sweet
aftertaste
of
roasted
coffee
beans
i
have
had
this
on
cask
as
well
the
cask
served
is
even
better
than
the
bottle
if
that
is
possible
let
this
one
warm
a
tad
to
truly
enjoy
the
wonders
that
this
beer
has
to
offer
d
i
prefer
sam
smiths
over
this
but
if
i
night
of
dark
beer
was
at
hand
i
wouldnt
pass
up
one
of
these
not
the
best
but
still
pretty
tasty
this
has
become
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
and
is
a
classic
example
of
a
fine
porter
gotdamn
near
faultless
this
is
the
stuff
wow
so
fragrant
really
malty
grainy
a
bit
grassy
and
some
molasses
big
very
creamy
clingy
head
with
lotsa
lace

more
this
was
amazing
and
it
was
a
fluke
i
picked
it
up
very
nice
and
will
drink
again
drinkability
very
drinkable
porter
in
a
can
good
example
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
easier
to
enjoy
i
like
it
and
might
buy
again
overall
a
pretty
delicious
tasting
porter
deep
and
flavorful
recommended
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
of
molasses
and
dark
roasted
malts
the
roasted
malts
are
more
in
the
tone
of
coffee
than
anything
else
the
beer
has
a
sweet
undertone
to
the
dark
roasted
coffee
it
almost
tastes
like
a
coffee
that
has
been
on
the
burner
for
a
bit
but
has
yet
to
burn
the
beer
has
quite
a
lot
of
flavours
which
are
hard
to
place
but
it
makes
the
beer
quite
unique
there
is
almost
no
hop
flavour
in
this
beer
i
dont
think
thats
an
issue
but
its
worth
noting
the
beer
isnt
too
drinkable
for
me
but
it
is
a
great
beer
to
star
the
evening
with
bottle
10
99
6pk
i
believe
beautiful
dark
brown
color
with
cherry
highlights
minimal
off
white
head
that
faded
pretty
quickly
chocolate
smell
dominates
but
trace
of
coffee
in
background
great
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
complex
beer
taste
is
very
complex
to
me
hard
to
easily
describe
as
a
new
rater
overall
it
is
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
of
the
great
beers
how
very
british
great
beer
wait
did
i
say
that
already
well
its
true
definately
something
ill
be
drinking
again
and
again
taste
thick
and
creamy
with
a
dominant
cafe
de
leche
taste
smooth
through
the
midpalate
with
a
chocolate
note
and
a
lighter
roasted
malt
note
finishes
as
black
coffee
very
satisfying
i
tried
this
beer
on
october
7
2007
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
beautiful
dark
murky
brown
colour
with
a
large
tan
coloured
head
the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
malt
and
yeast
with
some
sweet
hints
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
full
with
some
mild
carbonation
almost
creamy
the
taste
was
malty
with
some
hints
of
caramel
the
possible
sweetness
in
the
aroma
this
was
a
very
good
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
it
pours
out
dark
brownwith
a
14
inch
head
which
goes
quickly
smells
of
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
coffee
smell
tastes
of
chocolate
and
malted
coffee
a
little
sweetness
feels
great
in
your
mouth
very
nice
beer
to
drink
flavorful
and
enjoyable
it
is
exspensive
but
it
is
the
best
porter
i
have
ever
tasted
i
will
buy
it
again
some
time
and
recomend
trying
it
this
poured
a
deep
brown
with
almost
no
head
it
smelled
sweeter
than
i
expected
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
it
tasted
of
dark
chocolates
with
a
burnt
malt
and
slight
coffee
aftertaste
it
was
very
creamy
and
smooth
as
it
went
down
with
a
tad
bit
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
and
very
enjoyable
to
drink
d
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
candy
like
flavor
gets
to
be
a
bit
too
much
after
a
while
not
bad
overall
and
certainly
worth
a
try
d
extremely
sessionable
and
very
rewarding
to
drink
its
relatively
cheap
and
available
in
most
beer
stores
oh
yeah
d
easy
drinking
and
a
classic
i
will
revisit
this
for
sure
d
very
drinkable
drink
with
red
meat
and
sharp
cheese
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
porter
i
will
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
the
beer
arrived
with
a
translucent
black
body
and
a
thin
white
head
the
beer
tasted
of
a
pleasant
mix
of
dark
and
pale
malts
with
a
bit
of
british
hops
wellbalanced
and
very
filling
but
i
feel
that
there
are
better
options
out
there
pours
a
transparent
mahogany
color
with
dark
red
hues
a
pinkys
width
of
beige
lacing
with
little
retention
but
good
lacing
smells
of
caramel
toffee
nuts
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
espresso
taste
starts
of
with
roasted
malts
caramel
molasses
and
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
cherries
and
a
bitter
coffee
finish
medium
in
body
and
very
smooth
and
creamy
but
with
a
dry
finish
being
lower
in
alcohol
and
rich
in
flavors
make
this
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
especially
during
the
winter
months
mmm
with
the
cheese
this
is
divine
a
solid
porter
notes
this
is
a
remarkable
english
porter
this
one
could
me
through
the
coldest
of
winter
nights
cheers
overall
a
supremely
well
balanced
stout
another
world
class
brew
from
fullers
d
very
different
from
its
american
cousins
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
it
is
not
at
all
complex
its
just
an
amazing
brew
one
of
the
best
tasting
brews
i
have
ever
had
complex
with
chocolate
and
coffee
flavours
deep
and
delicious
unbelievably
easy
to
drink
with
a
full
flavour
and
aggressive
yet
not
overly
love
this
beer
i
get
all
giddy
when
i
see
this
at
a
friends
house
bottle
with
best
before
0808
on
it
pours
a
real
deep
dark
reddish
brown
with
some
light
shining
through
it
the
aromas
are
very
welcoming
with
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
caramels
nuts
and
some
sweet
fruity
notes
it
has
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
and
texture
to
it
with
a
slight
carbonation
to
it
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
and
expresso
take
control
with
subtle
fruity
and
sweet
tastes
round
it
out
for
a
very
solid
drinkable
porter
ill
definitly
keep
and
eye
out
for
some
more
of
this
if
i
see
it
in
the
future
great
stuff
good
stuff
recommended
d
definitely
easy
to
drink
but
would
have
appreciated
something
with
more
taste
than
smokiness
and
moderate
maltfeel
d
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
delicious
not
too
filling
not
too
sweet
and
in
general
a
very
delicious
porter
wish
i
had
more
than
just
one
all
in
all
a
decent
porter
tap
gingerman
poured
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
light
thin
beige
head
smell
was
great
and
of
dark
fruitiness
dried
fig
alcohol
and
a
definite
mocha
coffee
smell
taste
was
rich
creamy
and
coffee
like
with
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
mouthfeel
was
almost
a
bit
oily
and
nicely
thick
for
a
porter
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
porter
i
have
had
to
date
there
seems
to
be
an
enormous
complexity
that
comes
off
as
simple
and
enjoyable
very
much
recommended
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
bber
was
a
black
ebony
delight
with
a
very
tan
head
the
smell
was
of
nice
roasted
malts
and
nuts
the
taste
was
smooth
coffee
with
toasted
goodies
that
were
just
wonderful
to
savor
i
can
only
imagine
hoe
fine
this
beer
would
be
on
tap
and
reallly
fresh
i
will
certainly
buy
again

the
taste

little
on

this

would
be
even
more
appealing
in
any
event
justifiably
a
favorite
pint
at

and
also
from

bottles
the
beer
arrives
with
a
wonderful
dark
body
and
a
nice
foamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
is
extremely
enticing
very
smooth
like
drinking
an
espresso
chocolate
cake
covered
in
cream
i
find
this
to
be
far
better
on
cask
than
the
bottled

canned
versions
exellent
example
of
the

knock
yourself
out

overall
this
is
an
outstanding
porter
that
is
certainly
among
my
favorites
within
the
style
highly
recommended
i
havent
had
a
bottle
of
this
in
a
long
time
so
i
decided
to
give
it
another
go
its
not
quite
as
good
as
i
remembered
or
maybe
ive
just
drank
lots
of
great
beer
in
between
its
a
little
one
dimensional
and
i
wish
it
had
more
body
i
had
a
pint
of
bushwakker
palliser
porter
last
night
and
it
was
better
than
this
the
beer
poured
an
impenetrable
black
with
no
head
into
a
pint
glass
not
much
aroma
just
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
the
taste
was
the
classic
porter
combination
of
flavors
roasted
barley
with
undertones
of
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
excellent
very
low
carbonation
no
lacing
down
the
glass
and
served
close
to
cellar
temperature
fullers
is
in
my
opinion
the
benchmark
for
the
english
porter
style
drather
drinkable
for
such
a
dark
pourwould
be
hard
to
stop
after
one
if
there
were
another
lying
aroundbut
for
tonight
this
was
a
great
beer
after
a
long
holiday
filled
with
watery
beers
poured
dark
and
evil
looking
black
as
the
night
nice
1
finger
head
with
a
hard
pour
dwindling
to
nothing
but
some
stickiness
smell
is
of
roasted
or
smoked
chocolate
and
caramel
perhaps
some
smoked
wood
as
well
taste
was
very
smooth
smoky
rich
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
at
all
mouth
fell
was
fair
a
little
thin
drinkability
is
way
up
there
as
this
is
very
smooth
and
mild
to
the
mouth
and
nose
nice
to
keep
handy
when
you
want
something
easy
to
drink
that
wont
knock
you
over
d
very
easy
to
drink
all
night
this
will
become
a
regular
for
me

drinkability
nice
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
very
good
for
a
porter
just
not
my
go
to
style
highly
recommended
for
porter
fans
worth
a
try
for
everyone
else
d
very
good
a
fantastic
dark
session
brew
with
the
5
4
abv
and
satisfying
coffee
flavor
very
dark
and
inviting
thin
creamy
head
that
does
not
stay
around
too
long
seemed
to
dissipate
after
a
short
while
some
roasty
burnt
flavors
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
chocolate
the
taste
was
full
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
with
a
little
bit
of
sugar
and
chocolate
it
was
more
smoky
than
i
expected
but
still
very
good
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
thin
judging
by
its
appearance
but
not
too
thin
this
was
a
decent
pint
and
will
tag
it
as
a
safebet
porter
whenever
i
see
it
on
tap
anywhere
first
beer
from
fullers
and
it
was
quite
disappointing
not
one
of
the
better
porters
i
have
had
first
place
i
have
ever
seen
a
bottle
so
i
grabbed
one
not
recommended
and
would
not
drink
again
d
a
highly
drinkable
and
well
rounded
beer
with
a
great
mix
of
flavours
d
really
good
beer
complex
and
enjoyable
at
5
4
you
can
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
if
i
had
another
bottle
i
would
get
into
it
i
have
other
porters
to
try
tonight
though
a
creamy
white
head
sits
on
top
of
the
black
body
known
as
london
porter
its
both
light
and
full
of
flavor
the
taste
is
a
fight
between
molasses
chocolate
and
coffee
but
overall
it
wont
wreck
your
palate
and
goes
down
very
easy
finish
is
semidry
with
smoky
tones
this
would
be
some
devastating
stuff
if
the
pub
i
had
this
ontap
tonight
served
it
in
a
huge
one
liter
mug
this
is
one
of
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
in
my
whole
life
there
is
so
much
flavor
in
this
beer
so
rich
in
flavor
that
you
should
drink
very
slowly
to
make
sure
you
get
the
full
effect
alot
of
effort
was
put
into
this
beer
so
i
really
cant
describe
it
to
a
t
just
go
try
it
for
yourself
it
is
worth
the
few
extra
bucks
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
ive
had
this
beer
on
draught
previously
and
seem
to
recall
it
being
more
viscous
but
the
pour
seems
thin
and
the
head
is
virtually
nonexistent
the
appearance
reminds
me
of
soda
like
root
beer
or
coke
with
less
carbonation
in
the
nose
we
have
chocolate
coffee
and
a
good
amount
of
black
licorice
milk
chocolate
and
licorice
are
the
first
taste
followed
by
a
dry
hop
bitterness
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
makes
this
a
delightful
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
could
be
richer
for
this
style
regardless
of
that
this
is
a
really
tasty
and
well
made
beer
easy
drinking
highly
recommended
very
dark
shades
of
brown
with
light
nice
creamy
light
tan
head
the
nose
was
strong
of
dark
chocolate
and
fresh
coffee
aromas
of
the
delicious
english
hops
are
present
again
the
taste
is
well
balance
with
coffee
chocolate
and
the
english
fuggle
hops
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
classic
porter
i
would
recommend
it
with
a
good
burger
or
fish
and
chips
standard
wellrounded
porter
delicious
and
madly
drinkable
but
doesnt
leave
you
entirely
satisfied
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
medium
light
tan
head
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
with
coffee
notes
and
some
floral
hops
nice
malty
taste
notes
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
dark
fruit
nice
background
sweetness
a
few
herbal
hops
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
dark
malt
quite
balanced
nuanced
and
delicious
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
just
about
right
for
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
a
great
porter
overall
very
very
dark
brown
attractive
pour
with
offwhite
head
that
lingered
for
a
while
aroma
is
of
coffee
taste
is
also
of
coffee
but
this
beer
is
not
too
bitter
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
nice
as
carbonation
level
is
just
just
right
a
nice
sessionable
porter
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
couple
fingers
of
quickly
fading
head
smells
very
roasty
some
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffee
grounds
tastes
of
sweet
roast
a
little
coffee
grounds
show
as
it
warms
along
bakers
chocolate
and
a
minor
bite
in
the
finish
light
in
the
mouth
with
good
carbonation
easy
going
session
beer
with
a
little
oomph
not
much
more
to
say
this
is
a
great
beer
and
like
the
esb
this
is
the
standard
for
the
style
imo
highly
recommended
a
quintessential
porter
every
other
porter
dreams
of
growing
up
to
be
like
this
d
a
great
porter
rich
yet
easy
to
drink
many
more
than
2
at
a
time
this
ale
is
a
fine
blend
of
malty
flavors
w
subtle
roast
and
char
notes
excellent
tasting
porter
from
the
1st
sip
to
the
last
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
ive
had
porters
that
are
heavy
on
the
sweet
side
which
goes
against
type
or
are
too
bitter
well
this
ones
just
right
ill
have
another
this
one
confused
me
a
little
initially
but
after
i
got
used
to
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
tasty
poured
a
solid
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
dissolves
a
little
quick
for
me
solid
lacing
nose
is
pure
almost
sweet
roasted
malt
roasted
molasses
maybe
some
light
prunes
even
pomegranate
flavor
is
interesting
first
off
is
actually
tons
of
toasted
malt
some
orange
coffee
not
nearly
as
fruity
and
sweet
as
the
aromas
would
suggest
a
taste
reminiscent
of
cigarettes
as
well
which
im
not
loving
light
nuts
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
body
is
fairly
full
with
solid
carbonation
i
was
totally
turned
off
by
that
initial
cigarettey
flavor
i
have
no
idea
what
it
could
be
but
it
faded
as
i
drank
and
by
the
end
i
was
quite
enjoying
this
one
bottle

of

pours
out
a
cola
redish

with
surprising
clarity
excellent

followed
by
a

is
medium
roast

nuts
slightly
bitter
finish
from
the
roasted
barley
and
some
herbal
hops
not
at
all
sweet
and
has
a
nice
body
to
it
great
example
of
a
sessionable
porter

a
nice
dark

dark

carmelwith
a
hint
of
butterscotch
in
the
finish
goodbut
not
out
standing
in
my
opinion
d
very
drinkable
even
in
warm
weather
a
great
example
of
the
style
fullers
seldom
disappoints
and
this
is
one
of
their
better
beers
ive
had
this
many
times
in
the
past
so
really
looked
forward
to
finally
reviewing
it
poured
a
dark
although
not
completely
opaque
liquid
with
a
light
mochatan
head
that
was
a
finger
thick
and
had
staying
power
good
lacing
an
understated
aroma
of
figs
gave
way
to
the
smell
of
a
freshly
opened
box
of
dark
chocolates
very
subtle
not
overpowering
very
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
texture
well
balanced
bitterness
and
chicory
overtones
the
pleasant
finish
leaves
you
wanting
more
i
found
this
as
i
have
in
the
past
a
clean
and
not
overly
complicated
porter
that
always
satisfies
comments
one
heck
of
a
beer
would
be
great
with
a
turkey
on
rye
or
a
baked
potato
having
a
few
riesens
wouldnt
be
bad
either
its
one
of
those
beers
you
have
to
say
wow
out
loud
after
the
first
taste
overall
this
was
great
i
really
enjoyed
the
roasted
flavor
and
the
full
on
malt
assault
this
could
have
been
one
of
my
more
favorite
brews
to
date
really
a
top
noth
offering
and
i
would
be
thrilled
to
get
some
more
this
is
my
second
fullers
the
other
being
the
equally
good
esb
more
exploration
of
this
great
brewery
is
in
order
an
exceptional
porter
had
from
the
bottle
and
was
glad
to
see
this
ontap
this
evening
medium
creamy
head
that
left
great
lacing
and
also
lasted
near
the
duration
of
the
beer
smell
of
light
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
taste
was
much
of
the
same
very
clean
and
refreshing
mix
of
chocolate
and
coffee
balanced
by
a
faint
hop
bite
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
smooth
very
easy
going
down
and
unlike
any
other
ive
tried
easy
drinkability
session
is
one
word
to
describe
the
phenomenon
i
like
the
taste
is
rather
similar
to
the
nose
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
the
hops
round
up
everything
neatly
i
will
certainly
make
room
in
my
fridge
for
this
one
this
is
the
beer
that
makes
me
reconsider
my
preference
for
the
more
hoppy
american
style
porters
i
love
them
both
but
fullers
is
downright
near
perfect
pours
exactly
as
a
porter
should
deep
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
settles
very
slowly
heavy
caramelmolasses
aroma
with
a
hint
of
bittering
hops
in
the
front
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
thick
and
creamy
with
dark
roasted
malts
molasses
nutty
chocolate
and
mildly
bitter
ending
not
too
strong
alcoholwise
keeping
the
taste
mild
for
such
a
heavy
beer
one
of
the
most
drinkable
porters
ive
ever
had
simply
because
of
the
mouthfeel
and
rich
character
very
close
in
competition
with
sam
smith
poured
dark
brown
with
a
somewhat
small
head
and
okay
lacing
looks
like
a
porter
should
the
smell
is
of
lightly
toasted
grain
and
some
dry
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
similar
rounded
with
dry
malt
characteristics
licorice
and
slightly
nutty
a
semi
sweet
chocolate
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
somewhat
creamy
very
drinkable
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
tasty
and
full
of
body
the
low
to
middle
level
of
alcohol
makes
me
think
i
could
drink
three
or
four
of
these
while
reading
a
book
or
hanging
out
on
ba
without
too
much
consequence
overall
right
tasty
brew
will
definitely
be
looking
for
more
of
this
taste
is
maltbitter
but
mild
with
coffee
chocolate
and
cacoa
hops
give
the
beer
an
earthy
bitter
and
hoppiness
which
is
also
a
bit
resinous
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
this
all
sounds
like
another
porter
but
the
amazing
balance
between
the
burned
taste
and
malt
and
hops
make
this
beer
stand
out
also
the
way
the
burned
taste
develops
when
emptying
the
glass
is
a
sign
of
a
lot
of
craftmanship
d
excellent
i
think
that
this
is
fullers
best
beer
it
stands
well
and
above
the
sierra
nevada
porter
i
just
had
cant
believe
this
is
my
first
try
of
this
classic
brew
this
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
lacy
malt
chocolate
head
aroma
is
heavy
roasted
coffee
with
some
chocolate
hints
and
malt
hints
taste
is
nice
a
little
thin
but
nice
coffee
and
dark
cocoa
with
some
bitterness
as
the
backbone
this
beer
goes
down
extra
smooth
and
makes
an
easy
session
beer
great
drinkability
this
one
goes
on
my
list
of
favorites
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
heavy
on
the
mocha
with
a
touch
of
cream
theres
a
decent
dry
bitterness
but
nothing
astringent
or
unpleasant
and
longlasting
coffee
aftertaste
to
me
the
mark
of
a
great
beer
is
in
the
aftertaste
and
while
this
isnt
the
most
complex
porter
its
a
fantastic
porter
a
beer
worth
sitting
down
and
analyzing
or
just
enjoying
quite
yummy
give
it
a
try
overall
this
brew
is
masterfully
crafted
to
provide
a
wide
breadth
of
flavors
and
aromas
to
satisfy
picky
drinkers
of
any
taste
myself
included
extremely
well
done
fullers
cheers
all
in
all
a
definite
winner
more
flavour
than
guinness
despite
the
lack
of
any
roast
barley
d
pretty
good
goes
done
smooth
because
of
its
light
body
final
statement
a
very
fine
porter
try
it
drinkability
good
coffee
lovers

san
francisco

poured
very
dark
almost
black
big
fat

of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
very
nice
slightly
bitter
finish
a
simply
outstanding

dark
brownish
black
with

light
tan
head
the
slightly
buttery
aroma
features
dark
roasted
malts

and
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
roasted

coffee
with
a
nice
dry
and
bitter

is
an
outstanding
porter
that
is
certainly
among

is
primarily
coffee
with
bitersweet
cocoa
and
roasty
malts
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
relatively
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
md
good
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
carbonation
is
lively
enough
with
the
taste
being
a
bit
different
than
other
american
porters
ive
had
i
must
say
i
prefer
the
american
style
with
a
little
less
roastiness
and
a
little
more
sweetness
goes
down
very
easy
tastes
bold
full
strong
yet
i
know
i
can
safely
have
a
few
another
is
sitting
on
the
counter
warming
a
couple
degrees
even
as
i
type
this
cant
wait
too
overpowering
in
the
coffee
stakes
for
me
the
chocolate
and
caramel
i
can
handle
ok
but
just
a
little
too
much
decaff
drinkability
is
very
good
super
smooth
and
well
balanced
overall
im
not
a
big
coffee
drinker
but
someone
who
enjoys
coffee
will
enjoy
this
brew
i
really
wasnt
diggin
this
brew
actually
it
was
one
of
the
more
bland
porters
ive
had
p
d
at
5
4
abv
this
is
supremely
drinkable
this
beer
has
a
pretty
nutty
flavor
along
with
some
notes
of
charcoal
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
cold
coffee
not
much
in
the
form
of
a
hop
pressence
but
it
works
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
great
a
very
good
porter
best
before

a
desirable
session

real
nice
porter

tried
this
you
dont
know
what
your
missing
definitely
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
fairly
light
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
it
was
fine
and
appropriate
as
is
pours
almost
black
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
one
inch
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
to
just
covering
the
beer
but
with
sheets
of
lacing
to
the
finish
smell
roasted
coffee
dark
caramel
brown
sugar
or
burnt
sugar
taste
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate

a
slightly
smoke

buy
it
again

tasty

beer
absolutely
delicious
cheers
d
pretty
enjoyable
a
good
departure
from
your
average
american
porter
the
drinkability
is
very
good
at
first
i
thought
ok
a
good
porter
but
i
wont
be
hunting
it
down
but
that
later
tastes
after
it
warms
are
just
great
and
yes
i
will
be
buying
more
prosit
mk
pours
a
rich
deep
brown
color
like
coffee
from
a
french
press
head
is
tan
in
color
nearly
2
fingers
and
fades
to
a
nice
cream
cap
that
lasts
for
the
duration
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
fruity
applelike
notes
as
well
taste
begins
with
the
coffee
up
front
but
quickly
gives
way
to
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
toasty
caramel
with
an
eversoslight
hop
note
also
a
touch
of
fruitiness
in
there
too
which
seems
to
be
a
signature
of
english
styles
this
brew
is
easy
on
the
palate
with
its
medium
body
and
finishes
with
a
lingering
chocolatecoffee
effect
i
could
enjoy
this
one
as
a
desert
or
in
the
pub
all
damn
day
good
beer
worth
a
try
for
sure
straight
forward
plain
and
simpleand
just
great
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
dark
black
color
white
creme
colored
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
lacing
does
stick
around
the
glass
though
smells
really
sweet
fruity
and
malty
taste
great
dark
chocolate
start
bitter
coffee
finish
a
lingering
coffee
with
a
slightly
hoppy
aftertaste
that
makes
the
mouth
tingle
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
make
the
bitter
finish
stick
around
for
a
while
but
doesnt
allow
it
to
overstay
its
welcome
inviting
the
drinker
in
for
another
taste
overall
a
very
rich
complex
brew
that
is
worth
drinking
superiorly
drinkable
great
session
beer
im
really
blown
away
by
this
one
typically
i
find
most
everyday
british
beers
to
be
a
bit
hohum
this
one
is
fantastic
some
british
beers
stand
out
like
j
w
lees
harvest
fullers
vintage
etc
this
one
stand
in
the
same
category
as
far
as
quality
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
during
the
fallwinter
highly
recommended
for
any
porter
lover
and
well
worth
seeking
out
lets
just
start
with
the
looks
of
the
bottle
itself
this
bad
boy
is
a
16
9oz
james
bond
villain
with
a
beer
cap
pours
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
down
to
business
black
coffee
color
a
dark
tan
fairly
lingering
head
followed
this
beer
had
fantastic
smells
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
light
traces
of
toffee
the
taste
oh
what
a
taste
it
is
again
dark
chocolate
with
a
heavy
backing
of
rich
black
coffee
that
gave
a
subtle
bitterness
to
the
beer
following
the
english
porter
style
wonderfully
the
mouth
feel
was
substantial
but
light
enough
for
multiple
pints
of
this
beer
to
be
enjoyed
in
one
sitting
i
could
and
have
consumed
this
beer
on
a
very
regular
basis
pairs
phenomenally
with
raw
oysters
on
the
half
shell
along
with
a
hearty
shepards
pie
enjoy
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
given
the
reputation
the
brew
enjoys
a
good
solid
stout
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
if
youve
never
had
a
porter
try
this
one
this
beer
is
smooth
dark
rich
and
oh
sooo
good
the
head
wasnt
big
after
some
time
after
the
pour
but
the
lacing
was
there
the
smell
is
rich
in
coffee
but
without
bitterness
the
taste
is
unbelievable
even
better
than
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
i
love
it
overall
i
really
hope
to
get
more
of
this
fine
brew
its
awsome
i
think
this
is
great
beer
to
try
if
you
have
not
the
most
important
thing
is
i
would
i
purchase
another
six
pack
the
answer
is
yes
this
beer
was
all
it
was
said
to
be
beer
poured
a
deep
brack
with
a
hint
of
red
when
held
up
to
light
nose
is
somewhat
malty
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
very
good
of
chocolate
malts
roasted
producing
a
coffee
flavor
balanced
with
a
nice
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
very
nice
drinkabilty
is
extremely
good
this
is
a
beer
that
all
porter
fans
must
try
mouthfeel
was
thin
to
medium
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
the
taste
is
just
as
enjoyable
there
is
a
burnt
chocolate
flavor
that
is
accompanied
by
hints
of
coffee
and
a
caramalized
malt
to
accentuate
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
very
smooth
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
probably
the
best
english
porter
ive
had
to
date
fullers
has
raised
the
bar
for
porters
a
topnotch
english
porter
a
lot
more
smooth
and
creamy
than
american
porters
ive
sampled
solid
porter
no
doubt
not
really
anything
amazing
to
me
but
a
good
representative
of
the
style
i
highly
enjoyed
this
one
rich
and
malty
but
still
complex
in
flavor
at
5
4
alcohol
this
makes
one
great
session
beer
highly

english
porter

on
the
dry
side
and
drinkability
is
excellent
even
for
an
english
porter
downright
sessionable
another
style
defining
beer
from
fullers
the
flavour
started
with
a
bit
of
sharp
coffee
bitterness
but
that
quickly
yielded
to
a
smooth
chocolately
taste
low
carbonation
and
medium
body
made
this
exceptionally
easydrinking

recommended
and
a
must
have
for
porter
lovers
this
was
my
first
taste
of
fullers
london
porter
i
am
a
big
fan
of
american
porter
styles
so
this
was
an
attempt
to
try
the
original
porter
style
from
britain
i
poured
the
bottle
in
a
thick
pint
glass
and
noticed
very
little
carbonation
short
caramel
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
excellent
mostly
chocolate
with
some
caramel
first
taste
hits
the
buds
quite
a
lot
more
than
other
porters
ive
tried
reminiscent
of
a
darkroasted
coffee
more
hops
that
i
expected
and
not
very
heavy
after
a
few
sips
the
flavor
settles
into
a
very
smooth
and
malty
taste
this
is
an
excellent
porter
no
doubt
about
it
quite
easy
drinking
pours
a
deep
black
with
molasses
highights
big
vulgar
bubbles
form
the
head
and
quickly
fade
to
just
a
ring
the
aroma
is
a
huge
improvement
on
the
appearance
big
malty
chocolate
aromas
think
malted
chocolate
milk
jump
right
out
along
with
crispy
roasted
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
raspberry
beautifully
balanced
mouthfeel
with
some
roughness
from
roasted
malts
and
some
hops
coexisting
perfectly
with
a
slickness
not
far
from
an
oatmeal
stouts
tasty
chocolate
notes
along
with
dry
roasted
malt
notes
form
the
backbone
of
this
beer
but
there
are
also
earthy
hops
and
a
bit
of
smoke
in
the
palate
this
is
truly
a
wonderful
porter
one
of
the
best
english
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
tasted
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
this
beer
to
me
is
its
finish
i
taste
a
very
clear
and
pleasant
molasses
finish
i
find
it
a
rather
sweet
beer
with
low
hoppiness
small
but
persistent
head
little
lacing
average
mouthfeel
but
very
pleasant
taste
a
winner
id
definitely
drink
it
again
the
low
abv
could
make
this
a
great
session
beer
and
i
would
like
to
be
a
part
of
that
session
great
drink
on
a
cool
fall
day
what
a
way
to
treat
myself
this
fine
fall
afternoon
could
make
a
session
of
this
and
what
a
rich
and
decadent
session
it
would
be
also
a
great
introduction
to
just
what
a
porter
is
for
those
new
to
the
style
but
ready
to
do
some
adventuring
note
just
noticed
a
best
before
9
sept
06
on
the
label
stupid
low
turnover
store
from
how
good
it
was
i
cant
imagine
the
bottle
was
tainted
i
bought
this
beer
in
idaho
as
i
wanted
to
expand
my
english
beer
knowledge
deep
and
dark
color
as
a
porter
should
be
superior
malt
scent
espressochocolate
taste
that
is
remarkable
low
alcohol
and
very
good
drinkability
to
me
this
is
a
porter
that
should
be
drank
when
its
cold
outside
in
the
evening
by
the
fire
sit
back
relax
and
enjoy
ths
wonderful
porter
drinkability
high
drinkability
low
alcohol
i
could
drink
many
of
these
alas
i
can
not
get
more
smooth
and
a
little
silky
on
the
tongue
with
solid
carbonation
make
this
a
nice
feeling
on
the
palate
this
is
a
porter
you
want
to
always
have
in
stock
for
those
rainy
days
and
heck
sunny
days
too
with
all
other
days
in
between
friggen
amazing
this
one
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
small
sized
tan
head
it
smells
very
sweet
like
coffee
molasses
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
it
tastes
the
same
way
except
i
can
also
taste
some
caramel
and
that
it
has
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
creamy
and
smooth
its
also
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
think
it
could
become
a
great
session
beer
for
me
mouthfeel
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
rich
side
drinkability
is
limited
for
the
same
reason
i
liked
it
but
i
have
to
call
it
overrated
drinkability
if
this
is
really
what
they
drank
in
london
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
then
i
was
born
a
hundred
years
too
late
overall
after
reading
other
reviews
im
a
bit
nonplussed
good
but
nothing
great
to
me
i
was
expecting
a
bit
maltier
and
chewier
brew
d
i
dont
really
need
to
go
into
details
perfectly
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
there
you
go
drinkability
a
little
heavy
for
everyday
use
but
supremely
pleasant
nonetheless
this
one
rivals
my
all
time
favorite
okocim
which
i
hold
in
almost
religious
esteem
that
this
one
even
approaches
my
hallowed
beer
among
beers
is
really
saying
something
d
excellent
representative
of
an
english
porter
i
wish
i
had
a
second
bottle
one
of
the
best
porters
out
there
for
sure
fullers
london
porter
is
perfect
after
a
hard
day
at
work
a
wonderful
stressreliever
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
good
beer
period
d
i
would
drink
this
beer
anytime
it
was
offered
simply
tastes
great
and
is
surprisingly
refreshing
for
a
porter
rich
and
creamy
with
carmelized
fruit
flavors
as
well
as
black
coffee
and
chocolate
with
smoky
finish
extremely
drinkable
especially
considering
the
cost
of
4bottle
tall
11
2
oz
bottle
best
by
2907
it
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
that
is
practically
black
with
a
2
finger
light
brown
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
smells
creamymilky
with
rich
almost
sweet
coffee
chocolate
kaluha
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
green
hops
absolutely
divine
the
flavor
is
roasty
with
burntcharred
malts
coffee
chocolate
and
a
medium
bitterness
it
has
medium
carbonation
finish
and
a
body
that
is
medium
slightly
drying
and
becomes
creamy
by
the
end
overall
a
quality
porter
that
i
would
definitely
revisit
pours
dark
brown
with
creamy
tan
head
aroma
is
chocolate
carmel
and
coffee
taste
is
carmel
and
roasted
malt
finish
is
pleasant
roasted
flavor
without
too
much
bitterness
medium
body
and
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
too
expensive
to
session
but
this
is
a
quality
beer
a
very
nice
english
porter
and
one
of
my
favorite
porters
overall
pours
a
dark
mahogonyblack
with
a
half
a
finger
bubled
tan
colored
head
the
head
on
the
beer
is
unappealing
and
macrolike
the
aroma
is
caramelly
minimally
hopped
and
nothing
special
here
either
taste
is
very
brownish
rather
light
mostly
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
rather
fleeting
it
appears
and
then
disapears
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
a
tangy
carbonation
on
the
edge
of
too
light
for
a
porter
in
my
estimation
drinabilitywise
this
is
extremely
sessionable
and
a
decent
beer
nothing
worth
avoiding
its
a
good
drinking
beer
but
doesnt
scream
made
with
pride
given
its
characteristics
its
just
a
drinker
a
step
down
from
samual
smith
i
like
this
one
better
than
sam
smiths
taddy
porter
well
worth
its
outstanding
rating
d
an
good
beer
overall
worth
trying
a
mediumplus
body
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
alcohol
give
it
a
good
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
that
is
a
must
try
for
sure
i
had
forgotten
how
good
this
stuff
is
cheers
d
very
drinkable
a
very
tasty
brew
ive
had
a
few
fullers
brews
and
there

i
will
buy
this
again
and
again
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had

be
buying
this
a
lot
more
but
to
bad
i
have
to
drive
about
25
mins
to
get
some
oh
did
i
mention
the
best
by
date
on
the
label
pay
close
attention
to
that
drinkability
quite
drinkable
i
give
fullers

a
hearty
fine
dandy
fullers

bottle
really
nice

outstanding

poured
a
very
dark
reddish

that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass

background
slight
chocolate

and
light

in
the
taste
creamy

i
could
go
on
and
on
about
this
beer
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
seek
out
a
bottle
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
world
class
stuff
from
fullers
a
unique
and
tasty
porter
has
a
little
sharper
flavor
than
many
porters
but
a
classic
in
its
own
way
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
excellent
malt
flavors
very
good
this
beer
would
probably
make
an
excelent
session
beer
it
is
low
in
alcohol
and
the
flavor
is
quite
mild
i
havent
hd
this
beer
in
a
while
and
i
forgot
how
good
it
is
i
will
definately
be
having
many
more
in
the
future
nice
dark
look
to
it
not
pitch
black
but
close
solid
one
finger
off
white
head
with
some
staying
power
smells
like
molasses
tastes
a
good
deal
like
molasses
as
well
am
i
spelling
molasses
right
anywho
heavy
maltiness
fairly
full
body
creamy
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
if
you
like
that
sort
of
flavor
but
since
its
so
flavorful
it
might
be
a
turnoff
otherwise
notes
i
love
dark
malty
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
a
real
fullflavored
porter
if
there
was
a
textbook
pour
for
a
porter
thered
be
a
picture
of
this
beer
in
said
book
black
body
that
is
dark
ruby
around
the
edges
head
is
one
inch
of
nappy
brown
foam
nose
is
espresso
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
molasses
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
chocolate
reminding
me
of
chocolate
syrup
i
also
get
just
the
barest
suggestion
of
smoke
mouth
is
thick
with
sparse
carbonation
if
you
enjoy
porters
this
one
is
a
beer
that
youd
surely
be
able
to
drink
all
night
long
i
dont
like
porters
all
that
much
so
im
not
a
fair
judge
of
this
beer
id
say
it
was
all
right
actually
in
pretty
good
shape
considering
it
was
10
months
past
its
best
by
date
id
like
to
try
it
fresh
and
on
tap
in
london
for
a
rereview
very
drinkable
hey
porter
id
never
had
more
than
a
few
sips
of
porter
in
the
past
but
figured
i
would
give
this
one
a
try
although
typically
i
dont
really
enjoy
the
flavors
of
coffee
and
chocolate
here
they
come
across
somewhat
to
my
surprise
in
a
extremely
enjoyable
manner
especially
with
regards
to
the
smell
i
will
definitely
be
having
this
again
this
ranks
as
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
ever
had
i
was
expecting
a
good
beer
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
a
great
beer
ive
recently
tried
stone
ris
and
i
rate
the
fullers
london
porter
much
higher
london
porter
is
almost
black
in
color
with
a
tall
creamy
head
heads
color
is
a
dark
tan
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
alongside
a
sweet
caramel
a
sip
starts
with
a
blast
of
roasted
malt
with
notes
of
coffee
and
charcoal
an
underlying
caramel
sweetness
is
noticed
towards
the
middle
of
a
sip
and
only
increases
towards
the
finish
this
porter
has
the
most
roasted
malt
flavor
that
ive
tasted
in
a
long
time
which
makes
the
overall
mouthfeel
very
dry
a
strong
steady
malt
flavor
make
this
beer
a
winner
this
is
a
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
will
always
go
back
to
this
one
it
was
like
eating
a
very
rich
chocolate
cake
it
was
silky
and
smooth
but
the
richness
made
it
akin
to
eating
a
heavy
chocolate
cake
no
matter
how
much
you
love
the
taste
you
can
only
eat
so
much
this
is
a
beer
to
treat
yourself
and
indulge
as
a
desert
or
a
nightcap
drinkability
this
has
always
been
the
enjoyable
porter
in
my
book
as
i
find
this
easy
drinking
and
nicely
flavorful
solid
brew
medium
light
body
buttery
smooth
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
was
my
first
fullers
product
i
will
have
to
try
the
rest
of
their
offerings
mouthfeel
pretty
medium
bodied
for
a
pretty
dark
and
creamy
looking
brew
there
were
lots
of
dark
tasting
flavors
to
back
up
the
look
and
smell
of
this
brew
the
palate
of
this
brew
is
would
go
very
nice
with
some
hersheys
chocolate
overall
a
decent
porter
that
needs
a
little
more
flavor
not
bad
pours
black
with
ruby
highlights
under
a
finger
or
two
of
dark
khaki
foam
that
lasts
to
the
final
drop
nose
is
sweet
and
toasty
with
notes
of
toffee
and
cocoa
powder
taste
starts
off
with
the
milkysweet
toffeecaramel
and
transitions
nicely
into
roasted
malt
toasted
biscuit
and
a
nice
coffee
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
gliding
through
the
mouth
probably
the
best
english
porter
ive
had
to
date
as
i
have
found
them
to
be
characterized
by
thin
body
and
metallic
aftertaste
neither
of
which
were
found
here
glad
to
finally
find
this
classic
gem
at
a
measly
5
4
this
beer
has
more
character
and
charm
than
a
lot
of
the
bigger
beers
people
lose
their
shit
over
a
nearly
flawless
porter
and
ive
yet
to
find
another
that
even
comes
close
to
this
beer
is
good
happy
world
renowned
eering
drinkability
is
rather
good
this
went
down
easily
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
porter
this
one
is
a
great
choice
just
as
good
as
its
ever
been
the
bottle
im
savoring
now
is
fresher
than
the
one
i
reviewed
full

an
awesome

nicely
balanced
and
incredibly
drinkable
poured
blackish

some

and
a

smoke
mouthfeel

a
pleasant

an
exellent
english

flavorfull
and

very
drinkable
taste
the
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
come
out
first
as
with
the
smell
followed
by
the
toffee
and
a
bit
of
a
toasted
flavor
and
in
the
finish
theres
a
touch
of
black
licorice
theres
very
little
bitterness
to
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
dry
and
so
easy
to
drink
tan
head
with
good
lacing
covers
a
dark
brown
beer
aromas
of
caramel
chocolate
and
malt
on
the
nose
well
rounded
balance
in
this
beer
the
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetness
works
well
with
the
hint
of
hops
goes
down
so
smooth
no
heavy
alcohol
presence
makes
this
easy
to
drink
opinion
i
really
enjoy
the
subtle
complexity
of
this
beer
there
is
a
wellrounded
malt
bill
here
that
gives
the
palate
something
to
contemplate
i
can
pick
up
a
bit
of
hops
but
they
support
the
roast
as
much
as
actually
contributing
to
the
flavor
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
one
that
i
am
sure
that
i
will
drink
again
quite
a
nice
porter
and
certainly
definitive
of
an
english
style
porter
d
extremely
tasty
porter
a
classic
very
robust
moderate
to
low
alcohol
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
session
porter
simply
its
an
impressive
blend
of
history
and
tradition
mixed
with
wonderful
flavor
and
presence
its
a
joy
to
drink
one
and
as
much
a
joy
to
drink
another
and
in
fact
the
anticipation
is
almost
a
force
unto
itself
not
many
beers
can
boast
of
being
a
styles
blueprint
but
this
one
is
just
that
and
more
this
is
a
really
pleasent
porter
that
would
be
easy
to
sit
back
and
sip
all
night
long
tastes
good
at
cellar
temp

the
roasted

flavor
in
this

are
much
more

than

there
is

a

earthy

emerge

the

very

i
think
its
probably
better
closer
to

i
wonder
if
this
is
ever
served
on

probably
never
been

anyway
classy
beer
recommend
this
pours
a
nice
dark
color
out
of
the
bottle
approaching
black
but
not
there
the
smell
is
faintly
of
malts
the
head
is
nice
and
foamy
but
very
short
lived
the
taste
is
malty
in
a
dissapointingly
singular
way
a
nice
example
of
a
porter
to
give
a
try
but
not
worthy
of
searching
out
overall
fullers
london
porter
is
pretty
much
what
a
porter
should
be
this
one
is
close
to
a
sweet
or
coffee
stout
but
its
damn
good
love
it
engineoil
colored
with
a
nice
puffy
head
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
smooth
english
session
beer
the
taste
doesnt
knock
you
over
with
a
bounty
of
flavors
but
thats
fine
and
intentional
the
beer
is
smoooth
and
wellbalanced
rewarding
you
more
with
each
sip
theres
a
slight
astringency
which
is
the
only
think
that
kept
me
from
giving
it
a
5
for
drinkability
the
flavors
that
are
there
are
just
right
particularly
the
unexpected
chocolate
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
no
sharp
carbonation
or
thick
creaminessjust
an
even
reasonably
substational
body
had
this
on
tap
and
barleyhoppers
in
riverview
this
is
a
blackish
dark
brown
color
that
is
easy
to
get
lost
in
pours
a
nice
tan
head
on
top
that
hung
around
to
the
bottom
leaving
a
cocoa
colored
lacing
nice
this
is
a
sweet
malty
smelling
brew
that
sets
my
mouth
watering
this
had
a
nice
roasty
coffee
flavor
it
made
me
regret
not
drinking
more
porters
as
i
often
bypass
them
as
being
rather
heavy
this
was
not
it
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
was
very
drinkable
the
london
porter
pours
out
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
two
finger
head
it
leaves
very
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
too
instantly
you
can
smell
the
chocolate
and
malt
it
manages
that
chocolate
taste
without
coming
off
too
sweet
it
wasnt
very
heavy
for
a
porter
it
really
went
down
smooth
when
i
finished
it
i
really
wished
i
had
another
one
on
hand
very
good
drinkability
verry
high
i
cant
wait
to
recomend
to
some
of
my
buds
taste
is
toffee
espresso
bitter
cocoa
and
some
smokey
campfire
elements
bit
of
a
bitter
sour
aftertaste
which
lowered
the
taste
score
for
me
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thinner
than
id
like
for
this
style
still
a
great
beer
though
wish
it
was
more
widely
available
here
overall
this
is
my
first
porter
and
i
thought
i
would
start
out
with
a
traditional
and
well
reputed
one
could
definately
imagine
myself
sipping
on
quite
a
few
of
these
in
londontown
during
the
cold
rainy
season
of
fall
in
a
dark
dank
pub
and
throwing
some
darts
very
delicious
but
in
a
sort
of
an
understated
way
englishness
through
and
through
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
i
bet
this
would
be
murder
served
from
a
cask
from
the
bottle
it
is
still
a
fine
ale
with
a
great
deal
of
depth
and
a
complexity
of
flavors
that
i
have
trouble
picking
apart
an
extremely
drinkable
porter
my
favorite
from
the
uk
drinkbility
the
best
its
complex
enough
to
drink
tons
of
while
staying
interesting
and
good
yet
a
low
enough
abv
to
drink
alot
of
without
getting
trashed
very
good
beer
i
like
it
drinkability
this
was
an
exceptional
beer
and
matches
wonderfully
with
chocolate
dessert
its
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
great
porter
this
is
a
definite
must
try
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
strong
but
goes
down
smooth
appearance
wise
it
has
the
properties
of
a
traditional
ale
and
has
a
sweet
aroma
nonetheless
a
tasty
offering
deep
complex
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
a
little
flat
on
the
nose
slight
wafts
of
cherry
a
smooth
beaut
on
a
cold
evening
goes
down
easy
in
front
of
a
roaring
fire
at
3
00
a
bottle
its
good
to
go
medium
bodied
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
drinkability
very
good
enough
taste
and
feel
to
be
substantial
but
not
so
much
that
it
fills
you
up
or
is
a
chore
to
finish
classic
porter
smell
and
look
with
a
deep
black
body
supporting
a
firm
two
finger
thick
mocha
head
roasted
chocalate
overtones
and
great
malty
toasty
and
roasty
mouthfeel
well
rounded
and
balanced
with
ample
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
worthy
of
its
praise
notes
this
is
a
nicely
done
to
say
the
least
you
must
try
this
at
least
once
more
for
taste
than
for
the
whole
package
i
was
a
bit
sad
when
i
poured
this
brew
and
virtually
no
head
developed
the
surface
had
some
frothiness
which
mostly
stayed
in
a
ring
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
color
is
like
black
coffee
the
smell
is
faint
but
you
can
detect
chocolate
coffee
beans
and
marshmallow
aromas
very
toasty
the
taste
is
similar
with
coffee
flavor
that
is
somewhat
smoky
decent
bitterness
it
seems
average
at
first
but
improves
very
much
over
a
few
sips
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thinner
than
expected
and
the
carbonation
is
fairly
low
although
it
doesnt
necessarily
feel
flat
the
overall
flavor
is
solid
and
while
not
one
of
the
best
ive
had
it
seems
like
a
beer
that
i
could
easily
have
a
few
rounds
of
especially
with
the
moderate
alcohol
content
cheers
excellent
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
slightly
orange
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
left
spotty
clumps
of
lace
smells
sweet
and
tangy
like
caramel
and
a
touch
of
green
apple
with
the
malt
reminding
me
of
a
slightly
roasted
dopplebock
tastes
of
slight
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
subtle
smooth
and
sweet
sourness
that
finishes
with
just
a
touch
of
dry
hop
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
for
such
a
strong
flavor

this
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
as
well
i
am
a
big
fan
of
porters
to
begin
with
and
for
me
fullers
london
defines
the
style
it
epitomizes
robust
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
cafe
au
lait
head
that
was
not
too
think
but
very
creamy
especially
for
a
bottle
the
smell
was
deep
damp
and
earthy
with
aromas
of
sweet
chocolate
and
toffee
the
taste
was
rich
and
dark
with
serious
notes
of
coffee
dominating
the
taste
and
a
well
placed
bitter
hop
finish
hidden
deep
within
rolling
waves
of
toasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
exceptionally
creamy
and
thick
for
a
porter
but
it
was
not
at
all
obtrusive
if
you
are
attempting
to
introduce
a
friend
to
porters
use
this
as
an
archetype
porterbrown
with
a
light
tan
head
aroma
is
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
with
an
alcohol
presence
very
smooth
and
creamy
one
of
the
creamiest
porters
ive
had
recently
crisp
and
only
slightly
bitter
this
is
one
of
the
finest
porters
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
im
not
real
high
on
english
bottles
but
this
is
an
outstanding
example
flavor
is
rich
and
nearly
perfect
for
its
style
chocolate
stands
out
with
hops
complimenting
roasted
malt

dark
brown
w
the
aroma
flavor
of
coffee
chocolate
it
finishes
very
smoothly
this
beer
is
nicely
balanced
between
roasty
and
malty
this
is
a
world
class
beer
that
is
readily
available
in
a
lot
of
areas
enjoy
it
this
is
a
very
nice
porter
very
enjoyable
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
topped
off
but
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
retained
itself
quite
nicely
there
is
a
punch
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
noted
upon
initial
smell
followed
by
mild
aromas
of
coffee
and
butterscotch
the
taste
has
just
as
many
different
aspects
as
the
aroma
coffee
and
roasted
cocoa
are
definitely
the
dominating
flavors
here
finished
off
with
a
slight
bitterness
of
hops
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
fullbodied
beer
its
a
little
heavier
than
most
porters
that
ive
had
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
had
four
great
beers
tonight
but
i
decided
on
this
for
my
100th
review
fullers
is
my
favorite
porter
and
no
beer
in
the
world
tastes
any
better
imo
not
overly
impressive
in
appearance
but
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
wonderful
chocolate
notes
smooth
but
with
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
just
right
i
really
cant
find
any
fault
in
this
beer
and
its
outdated
802
cant
imagine
how
good
a
fresh
one
would
taste
i
did
end
up
finding
a
new
6
and
it
was
even
better
great
beer
dark
mahogany
liquid
pours
witha
creamy
tan
head
very
good
staying
power
creates
an
attractive
lacing
the
aroma
is
coffee
raisin
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
huge
on
coffee
with
some
bitter
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
fruity
sweetness
in
the
middle
very
nice
bittering
on
the
finish
gives
way
to
a
long
roasted
coffee
aftertaste
that
is
sprinkled
with
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
lighter
body
and
perfect
carbonation
drinkability
is
also
good
but
the
powerful
flavors
keep
you
from
pounding
this
one
it
is
one
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
not
guzzled
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
bubbly
dark
brown
with
a
very
thick
head
evaporating
rather
quickly
but
some
fine
lacing
throughout
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
beans
enough
complexity
to
keep
sniffing
very
smooth
and
crisp
a
wonderful
blend
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
coffee
mixed
well
a
creamy
body
yet
stays
smooth
throughout
a
smokey
and
coffee
beans
feel
left
on
the
palate
leaves
you
yearning
for
more
should
be
enjoyed
by
most
try
one
asap
well
well
well
what
do
we
have
here
a
damn
fine
drink
i
do
believe
a
nice
light
brown
head
that
sticks
all
over
the
place
floating
atop
a
nice
almostblack
body
smells
delicious
yep
the
taste
confirms
that
we
got
some
fine
mixing
of
chocolate
coffee
and
probably
some
caramel
probably
be
better
in
the
winter
but
im
trying
to
say
this
shit
is
good
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
example
of
a
robust
porter
this
is
the
one
you
should
try
it
embodies
the
style
perfectly
many
others
i
have
tried
are
too
close
to
the
line
between
porters
and
stouts
this
one
is
perfect
a
darn
good
porter
this
beer
tastes
hearty
bread
in
a
bottle
i
think
i
like
it
bottom
line
the
perfect
porter
for
quaffing
creamy
espressobrown
head
that
stays
a
while
pours
dark
reddishbrown
with
lots
of
small
carbonation
bubbles
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
earthy
smell
with
strong
coffee
notes
and
a
kind
of
sour
malt
the
scent
is
not
too
strong
but
pleasant
big
creamy
beer
that
tastes
like
coffee
with
slight
hoppy
overtones
finishes
with
more
coffee
bitterness
and
then
slightly
sweet
malt
wellbalanced
and
smooth
this
is
a
filling
porter
a
hallmark
of
porters
smooth
with
trace
carbonation
as
downable
as
any
poured
a
beautiful
black
with
that
oh
so
beautiful
nitro
head
smell
was
rather
subdued
overall
i
found
the
beer
pretty
bland
their
was
a
rather
odd
fruity
but
not
in
a
good
way
taste
that
i
couldnt
quite
pin
will
have
to
try
this
one
at
another
bar
and
see
if
it
is
any
better
general
overall
impressions
was
not
positive
in
heaven
there
is
no
beer
that
is
why
we
drink
it
here
pours
almost
black
with
ruby
highlights
has
a
thin
and
quickly
fading
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
with
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
smoke
flavor
is
a
combination
of
chocolate
bitter
coffee
some
grassy
notes
and
a
bit
of
caramel
as
the
beer
sits
for
a
while
the
alcohol
becomes
a
bit
more
pronounced
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
porter
that
really
hits
the
spot
aromas
of
sweet
maltchocolate
and
a
hint
of
roast
coffee
way
in
the
back
it
starts
malty
sweet
caramel
with
a
long
finish
that
is
roatytoasty
as
it
warms
it
has
a
medium
body
that
asks
for
more
drinking
the
texture
is
creamy
and
chewy
its
a
beer
that
goes
well
with
comfort
food
i
really
liked
this
one
very
easy
to
want
a
few
pints
in
a
sitting
a
really
drinkable
beer
great
for
cold
evenings
this
is
cast
and
mold
for
a
traditional
style
porter
it
pours
dark
rich
brown
with
ruby
highlights
showing
up
around
the
edges
the
head
is
a
dense
light
beige
yet
disappears
quickly
malt
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
dominate
the
aroma
the
taste
is
again
very
malty
rich
chocolate
coffee
and
a
bit
of
treacle
come
through
unlike
a
lot
of
american
interpretations
there
is
a
definite
absence
of
roasted
barley
and
a
decision
instead
to
focus
on
the
black
chocolate
and
crystal
malts
a
lot
of
domestic
porters
have
a
stoutlike
taste
profile
due
to
the
use
of
roasted
barley
though
usually
in
smaller
quantities
than
in
stouts
very
good
indeed
taste
this
alongside
anchor
porter
also
an
outstanding
porter
imho
and
youll
see
what
i
mean
about
the
roasted
barley
this
brew
poured
a
black
color
but
there
was
a
very
deep
ruby
hue
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
their
was
a
creamy
tan
head
cresting
at
three
fingers
and
eventually
settling
down
to
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
dark
chocolate
carmel
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
similiar
to
the
nose
it
started
off
with
the
dark
chocolate
and
malts
and
finished
with
a
creamy
buttery
taste
there
was
a
strong
coffee
aftertaste
and
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
this
is
the
kind
of
brew
i
could
drink
all
night
so
delicious
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
porters
ive
had
so
far
the
aroma
is
roasted
and
nutty
with
some
chocolate
toffee
appears
as
it
warms
the
front
is
roasted
grains
and
toffee
but
not
a
cloying
sweet
toffee
bitterness
in
the
middle
the
finish
is
dry
mouthfeel
is
velvet
this
is
an
excellent
dry
porter
that
hits
the
spot
perfectly
when
im
not
in
the
mood
for
the
sweeter
blacks
this
is
a
very
nice
porter
quite
expensive
though
but
it
really
deserves
its
position
up
top
overall
this
was
a
very
delicious
beer
it
has
a
different
flavor
profile
than
most
porters
that
i
have
had
not
a
beer
to
pound
all
night
long
but
a
beer
to
be
cherished
on
certain
occasions
this
is
a
great
porter
that
i
will
drink
again
and
use
to
judge
others
by
went
down
smooth
with
a
filling
feeling
this
is
going
to
the
top
of
my
beer
purchase
rotation
482
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
version
of
the
english
porter
and
is
certainly
very
drinkable
but
i
wish
it
had
a
smoother
mouthfeel
and
a
touch
more
body
and
malt
sweetness
some
maltodextrin
and
lactose
would
really
make
this
an
amazing
beer
as
it
stands
this
is
very
good
very
dark
ruby
pour
medium
tan
creamy
head
slowly
diminishing
to
leave
good
lacing
aroma
is
strong
with
dark
choocolate
roasted
cofee
and
caramel
taking
the
lead
flavor
follows
with
the
coffee
taking
the
initial
lead
followed
by
hints
of
caramel
and
finishing
with
a
long
lasting
dark
chocolate
taste
very
solid
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
on
the
tongue
and
that
long
lasting
flavor
keeps
you
remembering
what
you
just
drank
for
a
while
afterwards
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
dissipates
into
a
heavy
and
sticky
lace
nose
is
smoky
charcoal
sweet
roasted
malts
and
bitter
coffee
the
smoky
charcoal
also
comes
through
in
the
taste
along
with
some
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
buttery
dark
toffee
as
it
warms
some
notes
of
dark
fruits
and
raisins
start
to
express
themselves
a
very
nice
porter
and
a
treat
during
the
rare
bittercold
texas
days
this
was
well
worth
9
for
a
sixpack
of
12
ounce
bottles
definitely
my
favorite
porter
so
far
brown
with
ruby
highlights
body
foamy
beige
head
nice
lacing
incredible
chocolate
aroma
ive
died
and
went
to
hersheys
roasted
malts
coffee
chocolate
roll
across
the
tongue
hint
of
hops
in
aftertaste
mouthfeel
could
be
just
a
little
less
fizzy
and
a
little
fuller
no
pun
intended
but
neither
condition
is
a
deal
breaker
this
porter
is
in
for
the
long
haul
pours
out
a
very
dark
but
clear
brownish
colour
transluscent
ruby
and
garnet
around
the
edges
thin
but
tight
head
settles
down
and
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
fine
lace
a
decadent
aroma
of
slightly
burnt
sugar
candied
fruit
big
whiffs
of
semi
sweet
chocolate
and
discernible
dark
roasted
malts
ever
so
slight
floral
hops
peek
out
too
full
bodied
and
unbelievably
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
big
malty
flavors
of
layered
chocolate
cake
and
hints
of
bitter
espresso
and
other
subtle
coffee
flavors
any
malt
bitterness
is
quickly
countered
by
the
superb
balancing
sweetness
of
residual
sugars
finishes
smooth
with
a
slight
bite
of
hop
crispness
that
just
completes
the
beer
beautifully
i
could
drink
this
porter
everyday
the
perfect
brew
for
a
cold
winters
night
outstanding
when
poured
it
was
so
dark
brown
that
it
could
pass
for
black
and
the
foam
being
brown
with
a
beautiful
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
until
the
last
drop
the
smell
and
taste
was
of
coffee
chocolate
and
to
me
just
a
slight
hint
of
a
smoke
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
was
well
balanced
and
very
pleasant
on
the
palate
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
tasted
so
far
it
will
be
worth
purchasing
this
porter
again
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
a
nice
roasted
maltiness
which
mellows
into
a
caramely
sweetness
as
the
beer
warms
taste
starts
off
sharply
with
some
hop
flavor
and
coffeelike
malt
the
malt
becomes
more
caramely
midpalate
and
ends
with
a
roasty
bitter
dry
finish
mediumfull
body
quite
a
nice
porter
drinkability
damn
high
this
is
one
kickas
porter
like
their
esb
i
could
drink
this
all
night
im
going
to
have
to
get
another
pint
of
this
from
the
handpump
like
i
had
two
months
ago
amazing
stuff
full
flavored
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
this
is
just
a
winner
this
is
a
balls
out
top
notch
porter
it
is
in
your
face
with
great
flavor
all
the
way
through
looks
like
i
will
be
making
another
2
hour
plus
road
trip
to
get
more
if
i
cant
find
it
locally
deep
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
that
has
fair
retention
leaves
a
bit
of
lacework
down
the
glass
there
is
a
good
level
of
deep
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
bit
of
hop
aroma
in
the
back
the
roasted
malt
is
in
the
forefront
on
this
one
but
there
is
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
as
well
the
roastness
is
so
much
forefront
that
there
is
a
bit
of
a
bite
from
the
roasted
malt
the
hop
bitterness
is
at
a
good
level
but
kept
in
check
by
the
roast
malt
flavors
it
is
mediumbodied
lightly
carbonated
and
overall
a
tasty
robust
porter
i
am
a
big
fan
of
porters

this
one
is
no
exception

you
can
see
i
think
a

of
fullers
beers
and
with
samuel
smith
make
up
my
top
two
english
breweries
personally
quite
a
treat
for
us
dark
lovers
why
endeavor
such
perfection
this
was
my
first
porter
to
try
poured
a
beautiful
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
that
disipated
quickly
taste
was
of
roasted
malt
also
a
tiny
hint
of
spice
went
down
smooth
it
was
so
good
i
think
i
drank
it
too
fast
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorite
fullbodied
beers
one
word
delicious

word
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
to
die
for
yet
there
was
my
favorite
taste
in
there
to
some
hops
to
keep
me
happy
another
brew
that
kept
giving
different
flavor
bursts
from
start
to
finish
i
have
been
drinking
alot
of
porters
lately
and
this
one
is
not
too
bad
it
is
a
deep
amber
color
with
moderate
white
head
it
had
a
malty
aroma
it
was
less
roasty
but
more
chocolate
than
the
sam
smith
taddy
porter
i
liked
it
a
little
better
than
the
sam
smith
too
not
quite
as
stout
this
is
a
great
porter
the
head
is
dark
in
color
which
gives
you
the
idea
that
it
is
an
oatmeal
stout
but
upon
tasting
it
you
realize
you
have
stepped
into
a
realm
that
is
not
matched
the
chocolate
flavor
is
great
but
at
times
a
little
overwhelming
the
malt
is
very
present
towards
the
middle
and
can
be
complemented
with
a
nice
shot
of
irish
whiskey
it
finishes
very
smooth
and
definitely
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
definitely
my
favorite
foreign
porter
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
because
it
was
handpumped
i
know
this
review
is
slightly
inflated
but
i
dont
care
tremendous
beer
beautiful
dark
color
with
tan
head
you
could
see
the
richness
ebbing
from
the
top
carmel
sweetness
but
a
rich
dark
chocolate
flavor
with
some
bitterness
pulls
you
in
and
never
lets
you
out
so
fresh
nothing
to
distract
from
the
taste
creamy
but
not
in
a
nitro
way
just
and
abundace
of
flavor
wonderful
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
nice
sticky
tan
headholds
pretty
well
on
the
nose
there
are
aromas
of
caramel
and
malt
and
touch
of
toffee
and
coffeesame
on
the
palate
caramel
chocolate
notes
and
toffee
all
becomes
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
a
bit
at
first
it
tastes
lighter
then
id
like
but
by
finish
time
a
nice
sweetness
pulls
through
very
enjoyable
brew
okay
this
is
my
first
try
at
fullers
attempt
at
a
porter
having
already
sampled
their
1845
and
esb
it
had
a
wonderful
very
dark
ruby
red
color
it
created
a
wonderful
dark
tan
head
but
it
failed
to
hold
but
that
may
have
been
due
to
the
temperature
i
had
it
chilled
at
the
taste
is
good
with
elements
of
chocolate
coffee
and
perhaps
toffee
the
finish
is
good
it
a
little
lighter
than
i
like
for
this
style
also
applys
to
the
body
of
it
while
good
really
not
as
heavy
as
i
like
porters
to
be
pours
dark
ruby
with
a
nice
thin
beige
head
that
retains
nicely
one
of
the
best
smelling
porters
ive
come
across
nutty
roasty
and
chocolatey
very
very
nice
wow
what
a
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
really
an
outstanding
porter
ive
had
this
before
but
never
had
this
type
of
experience
they
were
probably
old
beers
in
past
great
coffee
taste
and
roasted
tones
vanilla
bean
and
bittersweet
chocolate
make
their
presence
known
full
body
what
a
treat
great
way
to
cap
the
night
almost
black
in
color
with
tannish
colored
lace
great
taste
and
full
bodied
another
great
brew
from
a
great
brewery
dark
ruby
brown
almost
opaque
nice
pillowy
head
absorbs
drips
like
a
sponge
pronounced
sweet
mocha
smell
one
of
the
nicest
smelling
brews
ive
ever
had
deep
deep
roasted
to
burnt
chocolate
flavors
right
off
the
bat
with
a
very
smooth
and
consistent
fade
some
sense
of
anise
complexity
as
well
satisfying
richness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
minimal
hops
but
they
do
add
in
concert
with
the
coffee
flavors
in
mid
mouth
medium
body
combines
with
lack
of
overcarbonation
to
give
a
nice
mouthfeel
without
an
overbearing
impact
nice
porter
to
be
sure
whew
if
im
ever
gonna
be
slapped
in
the
face
by
anything
other
than
a
female
this
is
the
one
its
a
slap
you
can
smile
about
roasted
coffee
with
a
taste
that
lingers
maybe
a
bit
of
chocolate
tasted
after
your
first
breath
only
my
second
porter
to
try
very
different
than
my
first
but
i
like
it
small
head
that
leaves
a
lace
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
thumbs
up
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
wonderful
balance
all
around
this
porter
is
among
the
very
best
as
far
as
im
concerned
perfect
carbonation
chocolate
malt
flavor
black
patent
bitterness
and
exactly
the
right
amount
of
bittering
and
flavoring
hops
just
great
stuff
good
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
thick
not
really
elegant
but
a
good
porter
very
complex
and
bitter
goodstuff
notes
a
more
than
decent
porter
a
great
brew
during
the
wet
raw
days
of
late
fall
early
winter
goes
great
with
imported
chocolates
also
very
dark
and
full
bodied
a
stronger
taste
of
licorice
and
coffee
tones
than
other
porters
my
porter
of
choice
and
as
in
most
english
brews
very
smooth
best
in
winter
im
having
second
thoughts
on
this
being
my
porter
of
choice
the
last
two
times
i
had
this
i
wasnt
sure
i
liked
the
very
strong
finishing
taste
i
think
i
might
prefer
the
more
mellow
tones
of
the
anchor
and
anderson
valley
porters
still
this
is
a
great
beer
an
exceptional
classic
london
porter
with
its
simple
complexity
you
know
exactly
what
youre
getting
and
wont
be
dissappointed
a
treat
on
tap
fullers
london
porter
in
the
bottle
ruby
black
in
color
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
lot
of
dark
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
strong
hops
with
dark
roast
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
taste
a
very
good
bitter
mocha
aftertaste
this
is
my
first
porter
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
an
excellent
beer
i
hope
to
find
this
one
on
tap
one
day
a
typically
fine
product
from
fullers
pours
with
a
big
tan
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
you
drink
very
smooth
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
a
creamy
almost
buttery
mouthfeel
that
leads
to
a
fairly
dry
finish
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
with
a
slice
of
birthday
cake
and
they
actually
went
great
together
i
woudlnt
say
this
is
my
favourite
porter
but
its
close
a
great
porter
lots
of
depth
of
flavor
with
dark
coffee
and
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
if
it
were
any
more
substantial
it
would
be
a
stout
still
a
nice
forgetful
drinker
i
like
this
nice
porter
that
is
lightly
sweetened
flavored
and
smoothed
by
molasses
and
vanilla
not
bad
i
prefer
a
thicker
more
robust
porter
but
this
was
decent
non
the
less
great
beer
a
good
porter
of
the
english
style
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
almost
like
a
baltic
porter
but
lacking
a
bit
across
the
board
i
didnt
care
for
the
mineral
quality
at
all
that
seemed
to
dominate
the
brew
overall
a
good
idea
but
it
just
didnt
pan
out
the
way
it
could
if
the
recipe
was
revisited
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
pardidise
by
the
slice
in
wernservillepa
the
appearance
was
a
dark
brown
color
body
with
a
thin
creamy
lace
round
the
top
of
the
body
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
and
some
molasses
the
taste
had
some
choclolate
notes
but
the
malts
and
the
molasses
was
the
dominate
flavor
the
mouth
feel
was
great
nice
and
smooth
and
not
thick
like
a
regular
porter
over
all
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
wish
they
bottled
it
pours
out
as
a
transparent
dark
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
at
all
on
it
this
has
a
surprising
appearance
for
a
porter
the
color
to
me
should
have
been
much
darker
the
smell
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
just
a
little
bit
of
molasses
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
pretty
weak
i
really
hoped
for
this
beer
to
be
much
more
flavorful
but
to
me
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
forgetting
something
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
kind
of
boring
not
really
sure
about
this
one
had
a
pint
on
cask
at
tap
and
table
it
appears
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
short
tan
head
the
beer
is
smooth
and
drinkable
but
a
bit
strong
for
the
flavor
impact
it
sounds
silly
but
a
6
beer
should
be
richer
this
had
a
pleasant
chocolate
and
coffee
roast
flavor
but
not
much
else
id
have
expected
it
to
be
only
about
4
5
anyways
its
a
simple
but
tasty
beer
certainly
worth
drinking
a
pint
dark
tan
with
a
thick
twofinger
mocha
head
nose
is
molasses
brown
sugar
roasted
barley
malt
and
chocolate
taste
is
what
i
should
have
expected
having
had
shoofly
pie
molasses
and
brown
sugar
with
some
bread
and
chocolate
very
sweet
no
false
advertising
at
work
here
finish
included
a
welcome
slight
bitterness
all
together
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
d
not
much
of
a
porter
of
molasses
fan
but
i
wasnt
too
impressed
overall
with
this
felt
a
little
bland
hopefully
this
falls
off
tap
soon
and
the
pub
gets
something
a
little
better
up
overall
this
was
a
very
solid
american
porter
that
contains
nothing
really
unique
in
its
flavor
but
it
is
quite
solid
and
very
balanced
recommended
drinkability
this
is
a
very
sessionable
porter
that
is
easy
to
quaff
and
hits
the
spot
when
looking
for
a
beer
in
the
style
worth
trying
this
i
love
the
aftertaste
of
the
shoofly
porter
you
can
take
a
sip
and
feel
the
malts
playing
with
your
taste
buds
for
a
long
time
after
swallowing
however
for
being
only
6
it
does
have
a
distinct
alcohol
flavor
with
so
much
riding
on
its
great
aftertaste
i
think
this
beer
is
best
as
a
slow
sipper
drinkability
a
very
solid
porter
from
lancaster
and
i
liked
the
nitro
aspect
with
all
the
flavors
it
was
bringing
id
drink
it
again
d
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
if
i
had
to
chose
i
might
actually
have
a
piece
of
pie
over
this
beer
nice
for
dessert
but
a
little
too
much
molasses
for
me
dgood
this
brew
doesnt
blow
you
away
but
it
builds
into
a
well
done
easy
drinking
and
flavourful
brew
drinkability
reasonably
drinkable
so
that
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
more
while
the
flavor
is
not
as
intense
and
rich
as
eating
a
piece
of
shoo
fly
pie
the
taste
and
aroma
capture
some
of
the
experience
ill
probably
try
this
one
again
overall
sweet
very
close
to
shoofly
pie
a
nice
dessert
night
cap
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
with
the
carbonation
full
bodied
and
spritzy
along
the
tongue
id
like
to
try
this
either
on
nitro
or
on
cask
to
escape
the
zippiness
of
the
bubbles
d
this
is
a
far
better
way
to
taste
shoo
fly
than
traditional
co2
i
find
the
malt
to
be
smoother
and
nuances
of
malt
come
forward
and
the
chance
to
taste
the
molasses
is
there
john
frantz
asked
how
did
you
like
it
i
must
say
i
appreciate
the
cask
much
more
it
isnt
gassy
and
i
actually
wanted
to
order
more
than
1
but
the
cask
was
kicked
d
not
as
much
of
a
shoofly
presence
as
i
was
anticipating
but
still
very
tasty
and
drinkable
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
lancaster
ive
had
and
certainly
unique
especially
for
the
area
this
one
was
dispensed
via
gravity
pour
and
arrived
with
two
fingers
of
soapy
foamy
deeptan
head
with
mild
retention
the
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
little
to
no
light
penetration
nose
had
an
interesting
mix
of
slight
charcoal
and
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
slightly
full
approaching
creamy
i
got
an
aniselike
flavor
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
dry
especially
so
for
a
porter
but
better
that
than
the
godawful
sweetness
of
its
namesake
d
i
liked
this
more
than
the
score
would
indicate
i
was
just
hoping
something
more
diferent
i
suppose
if
you
have
the
chance
definitely
try
this
one
d
not
too
bad
but
the
dark
roast
portion
of
it
is
a
tad
overpowering
i
think
the
molassess
should
be
the
focus
given
the
name
md
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
very
tasty
not
too
sweet
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
can
well
worth
it
overall
a
decent
but
not
outstanding
beer
a
really
cool
concept
to
localize
it
to
pa
but
just
something
that
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
on
tap
at
capones
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
smaller
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
chocloate
lighter
roastiness
and
caramel
tastes
of
chocolate
molasses
roast
and
caramel
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
i
love
shoofly
pie
but
just
didnt
see
it
in
this
one
o
a
solid
porter
that
goes
down
a
treat
looks
great
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
possess
a
satisfying
blend
of
roasted
malt
coffee
mild
molasses
and
earthiness
good
bitterness
but
not
excessive
nice
body
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
benchmark
for
an
english
porter
tasty
with
a
nice
roastdness
and
very
sessionable
let
it
warm
and
you
will
be
rewarded
this
is
my
perfect
pint
i
love
it
id
have
to
drink
a
few
pints
or
more
in
succession
to
really
start
to
adjust
my
palate
to
it
zero
in
on
some
points
but
what
a
memorable
ale
you
gotta
try
it
you
may
like
it
this
beer
pours
deep
brown
with
a
large
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
strong
on
cocoa
powder
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
roasty
malts
the
taste
is
good
its
got
a
great
effervescent
mineral
character
over
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
prickly
and
light
and
the
drinkability
is
good
a
solid
example
of
a
lower
abv
porter
the
likes
of
which
dont
seem
to
make
it
over
to
us
shores
all
that
often
intense
aromas
of
burntroastedtoasted
malts
these
turn
into
coffee
and
chocolate
flavours
in
the
taste
a
hop
bitterness
is
never
far
away
and
i
found
this
a
complex
and
interesting
porter
on
cask
at
town
hall
tap
in
minneapolis
this
beer
arrives
a
very
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
an
inch
of
solid
white
foam
that
stays
put
leaving
tight
rings
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
cocoa
powder
and
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
cherry
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
and
has
nice
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
a
cask
beer
silky
in
texture
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
porter
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
if
the
chance
presents
itself
pours
dark
brown
with
a
good
casklevel
light
tan
head
good
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
a
strong
component
of
diacetyl
which
is
thankfully
at
least
partially
covered
up
by
roast
and
chocolate
flavor
isnt
quite
as
bad
on
that
front
though
its
still
there
nothing
too
interesting
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
roast
okay
medium
body
with
a
good
creamy
feel
alcohol
is
a
nonfactor
easy
to
drink
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
solid
quaffer
not
something
youd
like
to
drink
a
lot
of
at
one
sitting
but
good
for
a
contrast
with
sweeter
or
more
sour
beers
and
it
certainly
stands
alone
a
good
and
well
balanced
porter
it
is
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
somewhat
watery
in
the
feel
and
easy
drinking
this
is
something
i
could
forsee
myself
drinking
all
day
long
while
getting
some
work
done
around
the
house
but
to
sit
down
and
just
sip
and
savor
this
isnt
the
brew
for
the
job
the
descriptiondetails
in
this
listing
are
more
appealing
than
the
brew
itself
minus
the
slug
reference
body
feels
watery
the
initial
pour
creates
a
monstrous
explosion
of
foam
one
that
slowly
settles
into
a
spongy
vanilla
crown
atop
an
impervious
and
foreboding
body
of
black
a
thick
lacing
begins
to
form
a
crust
along
the
glass
rim
the
nose
detects
some
subtle
yet
sweet
notes
of
honey
and
toffee
the
palate
receives
vague
tastes
of
nut
and
toasted
malt
old
slug
is
smooth
creamy
and
wellbalanced
yet
surprisingly
light
in
its
overall
body
all
in
all
this
porter
makes
for
a
really
nice
quaff
to
warm
the
holiday
or
any
day
when
thirst
comes
calling
probably
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
have
reviewed
it
felt
like
drinking
a
down
pillow
d
drinking
this
beer
is
a
breeze
and
its
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
very
sessionable
taste
is
much
improved
though
after
drinking
very
coffee
like
in
at
first
taste
and
nicely
balanced
with
malt
and
light
sugars
excellent
body
on
this
beer
with
a
faint
nut
finish
very
enjoyable
beer
feels
bigger
than
the
abv
it
states
would
drink
this
in
a
heartbeat
drinkability
is
excellent
the
tangy
yeast
and
mineral
quality
keep
the
interest
up
but
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
malt
body
and
flavor
d
solid
good
flavor
and
mildness
of
the
feel
make
this
am
all
nighter
overall
overall
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
it
looked
great
smelled
delicious
but
then
never
really
delivered
for
me
a
little
too
bitter
and
hoppy
and
i
didnt
get
enough
of
the
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetness
that
i
was
expecting
decent
beer
but
not
great
overall
this
beer
was
a
good
beer
i
was
taken
back
by
the
mouthfeel
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
heavier
if
you
let
this
beer
warm
up
you
really
let
the
complexities
of
the
aromas
and
tastes
open
up
some
warming
light
body
light
effervesence
slightly
dry
finish
watery
throughout
decent
overall
but
only
decent
d
quite
unspectacular
and
certainly
not
challenging
therein
lies
its
strength
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
quintessential
english
porter
low
abv
muted
flavors
and
easydrinking
worth
a
shot
especially
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
drinkability
i
think
ive
been
spoiled
by
american
porters
which
are
richer
in
flavors
ive
had
this
one
before
and
im
just
not
as
impressed
the
2nd
time
around
not
bad
and
maybe
if
i
was
in
a
pub
in
england
id
ask
for
another
glass
but
otherwise
not
something
memorable
or
grabbing
enough
for
me
to
pick
up
another
one
as
porters
go
this
one
is
a
bit
light
i
couldnt
generate
any
kind
of
a
head
from
this
one
even
when
pouring
from
very
high
nothing
more
than
a
very
loose
coketype
head
that
disappeared
almost
instantly
decent
aroma
of
charred
grain
and
molasses
not
very
strong
but
pleasant
enough
there
was
a
hint
of
citrus
as
well
rather
thin
in
the
body
appropriately
lacking
in
fizz
a
tad
watery
overall
the
taste
was
unusual
for
this
style
there
was
enough
toastiness
and
caramel
to
qualify
it
as
a
porter
but
the
illmannered
fruitiness
from
the
hops
took
over
too
quickly
with
prominent
flavors
of
orange
and
lemon
even
a
little
honey
this
tastes
more
like
a
bitter
than
a
porter
call
it
a
dark
bitter
perhaps
worth
a
try
but
only
once
exactly
what
you
want
from
an
english
porter
poured
this
beer
out
of
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
jet
black
coca
cola
colour
with
little
carbonation
and
leaves
absolutely
no
head
or
lacing
whatsoever
just
a
little
swirl
pattern
in
the
middleit
has
nice
sweet
honeytoffee
aromas
with
a
little
chocolate
in
the
background
quite
inviting
actuallyit
has
a
really
nice
nuttywoody
almost
caramel
flavour
to
it
with
an
average
mouthfeel
and
definately
finishes
with
a
nice
solid
chocolate
backnote
but
not
too
overpowering
by
any
means
just
a
really
easily
drinkable
beer
no
matter
what
the
temperature
is
outside
a
little
bit
of
a
bland
porter
at
least
in
the
flavor
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
im
sure
fresh
from
the
brewery
the
flavor
is
a
little
better
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
cask
recommended
pours
a
rather
viscous
black
body
with
onefinger
tan
head
that
leaves
lace
around
the
glass
a
mix
of
sweet
malts
like
dark
chocolate
and
some
roastedcoffee
malts
textbook
of
style
more
of
the
same
as
this
mediumbodied
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
balance
of
both
noticeable
sweet
malts
chocolate
caramel
toffee
and
dry
malts
coffee
roasted
biscuit
for
a
sweet
chewey
beer
that
has
a
dry

beer
slightly
warms
as
you
sip
and
it
is
a
sipper
despite
how
easy
it
goes
down
and
becomes
even
better
if
you
like
your
porters
more
to
the
sweet
mellow
side
than
this
one
is
a
keeper
bottle
very
little

not

mediumthin

with

but
pleasant
over

not
inspiring
beer
good
session
porter
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
a
very
decent
porter
was
a
tad
expensive
for
me
to
do
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
i
could
do
a
couple
of
these
at
a
sitting
but
then
id
be
ready
to
move
on
the
beer
reminds
me
of
a
few
southern
english
browns
that
ive
had
but
with
porters
depth
and
complexity
the
beer
promises
larger
than
life
flavors
first
but
the
settles
into
a
pleasantly
sessionable
beer
d
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
just
not
my
thing
overall
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
porter
in
my
opinion
i
was
hoping
for
more
flavor
especially
after
the
nose
was
so
strong
d
drinkable
but
average
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
this
is
certainly
an
easy
drinker
drinkability
is
excellent
the
body
of
the
beer
pairs
so
well
with
the
smooth
rounded
out
chocolate
and
roasted
flavors
its
easy
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
one
check
it
out
not
too
expensive
and
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
as
always
serve
nice
and
warm
the
beer
will
shine
note
one
last
thing
worth
noting
is
that
the
beer
actually
tastes
like
its
described
on
the
lable
often
times
the
descriptions
arent
even
close
so
props
to
rch
there
poured
this
one
at
home
about
45
minutes
after
i
sampled
it
at
work
so
it
didnt
pour
much
of
a
head
at
all
the
color
was
very
dark
brown
the
aroma
was
toasted
musty
and
woody
this
is
what
id
imaging
the
air
to
smell
like
in
london
the
flavor
had
a
bitter
hoppiness
with
toasted
flavors
up
front
finishing
with
a
slight
resiny
tone
light
in
body
with
layed
back
carbonation
d
pretty
good
not
terribly
interesting
but
easy
to
put
down
i
grabbed
up
an
old
slug
one
night
with
a
couple
porters
schwarzbiers
and
have
to
say
i
wish
i
could
find
it
on
draught
as
it
has
a
couple
deficiencies
bottlewise
the
16
9
oz
bottle
poured
ablackruby
color
with
a
flatness
that
only
thereafter
saw
a
tan
everso
slight
head
emerge
the
aroma
likewise
was
mild
and
i
was
immediately
not
expecting
much
however
its
slight
cherryporter
taste
was
not
too
sweet
and
had
a
nice
slightly
bitter
mouth
feel
a
mild
chocolate
chalky
aftertaste
followed
d
this
is
one
of
the
tastiest
porters
ive
tried
with
its
low
abv4
5and
flavorful
clean
taste
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
porters
around
would
like
to
find
it
on
tap
somewhere
taste
is
bakers
chocolate
old
coffee
malt
in
the
back
slightly
bitter
in
the
end
near
black
with
a
light
tan
head
this
beer
was
very
tasty
for
the
light
weight
but
not
the
most
complex
it
focused
on
black
malt
flavors
in
the
realm
of
black
coffee
and
dry
dark
chocolate
if
the
bottles
werent
prohibitively
expensive
8
50
here
id
probably
have
it
again
worth
a
try
this
is
a
superb
english
porter
recommended
weird
and
almost
pathetic
this
porter
is
not
a
shining
example
of
what
an
english
porter
should
be
nor
should
it
be
judged
as
such
4
d
a
decent
porter
it
is
showing
a
balanced
body
and
reasonable
depth
for
a
4
5abv
small
beer
i
expect
the
caskconditioned
version
to
be
thicker
and
more
3d
dimensional
in
terms
of
texture
but
this
bottle
is
already
very
drinkable
all
the
same
16
9oz
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
wtih
a
large
creamy
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
forever
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malts
with
notes
of
cocoa
and
cherries
the
taste
is
dark
and
roasty
with
some
unsweetened
chocolate
flavors
and
a
mild
roasted
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
old
slug
is
a
solid
english
porter
that
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
recommended
if
i
were
in
a
pub
just
grabbing
pints
to
down
with
my
friends
i
might
appreciate
this
more
for
its
drinkability
with
just
enough
to
it
to
keep
it
going
i
wish
i
could
concur
with
the
description
on
the
label
but
the
said
characteristics
are
too
subtle
for
me
to
truly
appreciate
i
suppose
with
a
modest
abv
and
no
off
tastes
this
is
an
easy
drinker
to
have
at
a
pub
chatting
with
friends
thats
all
d
quite
drinkable
coffee
in
aroma
big
white
head
on
reddish
tinged
black
bold
taste
spurred
on
by
the
fruit
whatever
the
red
cherry
is
medium
mouthfeeel
refreshing
above
average
carbonation
a
good
effort
to
get
this
flavour
with
an
under
5
abv
above
average
porter
d
easy
drinker
a
very
nice
porter
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
amount
of
tan
head
you
really
have
to
hold
it
close
to
light
to
see
a
ruby
showing
on
the
liquid
mild
coffee
tones
you
really
have
to
pull
at
it
to
get
something
flavor
is
good
there
are
some
richer
characters
here
but
overall
it
seems
a
little
bit
thin
and
watery
what
is
there
gives
a
nice
malty
flavor
but
i
feel
like
it
could
be
and
should
be
for
the
price
thicker
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
to
it
but
just
like
the
flavor
the
liquid
feel
is
too
thin
i
say
could
stand
to
have
more
body
overall
a
decent
porter
but
not
really
worth
the
price
at
all
have
had
much
better
examples
out
there
d
overall
i
liked
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
the
beer
pours
forth
from
the
500ml
bottle
a
deep
brown
to
almost
black
with
some
ruby
highlights
the
head
is
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
that
piles
high
on
the
body
of
the
beer
after
its
demise
the
lace
forms
a
thin
veil
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
has
a
rich
toasted
grain
aroma
sweet
with
slight
hints
of
coffee
quite
pleasant
start
has
a
decent
roasted
grain
flavor
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
top
falls
in
the
medium
category
just
barely
finish
has
a
mild
acidity
with
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
and
the
aftertaste
has
a
lingering
sweetness
with
just
a
touch
of
the
roasted
grain
bitterness
sticking
to
the
palate
d
i
like
this
one
its
easy
to
kick
back
with
and
you
could
probably
do
so
with
a
few
of
them
and
still
be
able
to
remember
where
you
were
the
night
before
cheers
medium
to
light
bodied
and
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
could
wash
down
just
about
any
happy
hour
pub
fare
without
slowing
you
down
d
mild
easy
drinking
porter
lacks
strong
flavors
normally
attributed
to
porter
quite
sessionable
nonetheless
aroma
is
mildly
bready
with
some
pepper
spice
and
a
bit
of
smoke
hard
to
discern
taste
is
milk
chocolate
bitter
coffee
and
lots
of
smoked
malt
very
interesting
and
different
mild
sulpher
aftertaste
and
an
oily
mouthfeel
not
bad
low
abv
makes
the
alcohol
almost
undetectable
great
liquid
bread
for
porter
lovers
overall
impression
a
little
on
the
light
side
overall
a
well
crafted
beer
no
real

may
benefit
from

nose

big
sweet
dark

some

taste
slices
your
throat
with
dark
caramel
flavors
followed
by
some
tiny
amounbt
of
chocolate
has
a
cola
like
mouthfeel
and
finishes
remarkably
clean
tastes
much
sweeter
than
the
nose
would
have
you
believe
with
some
very
distinct
fruit
bitter
malt
in
the
back
and
ending
on
a
node
of
hops
and
pears
theres
a
nice
fruity
hop
aftertaste
to
boot
somewhat
boring
for
an
english
porter
i
would
wager
this
would
be
considered
a
macro
porter
in
england
nice
for
the
states
but
not
something
i
would
actively
look
to
return
to
not
special
enough
for
me
to
want
to
try
again

the

down

as

has
allegedly
given
the

its

together
with
the

minus

i
like
porters
i
could
definitely
drink
this
one
again
but
its
not
particularly
noteworthy
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
not
much
of
a
head
at
all
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
chocolate
cherries
and
coffee
it
tastes
the
same
way
except
that
theres
a
slight
nutty
flavor
too
along
with
a
bitter
finish
its
medium
bodied
with
very
low
carbonation
the
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
too
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
a
little
bit
on
the
creamy
side
overall
its
pretty
good
i
liked
it
a
lot
not
much
alcohol
in
this
one
4
5
abv
and
it
if
wasnt
for
the
cost
of
a
single
bottle
i
would
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
porter
very
drinkable
recommended
awesome
good
from
the
bottle
but
never
miss
this
when
on
cask
ever
it
has
a
slight
cloa
coffee
taste
with
a
hint
of
burnt
nut
very
rich
nice
mouthfeel
more
coffee
at
first
a
malty
sweetness
to
follow
and
finishes
bitter
drinks
great
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
a
nice
experience
i
imagine
this
is
much
more
interesting
and
exciting
in
the
cask
as
it
stands
its
a
decent
porter
in
the
bottle
very
pretty
beer
deep
dark
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
stays
for
a
while
and
leaves
lovely
lacing
around
the
glass
just
gorgeous
smell
is
almost
all
chocolate
sweet
and
rich
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
background
taste
is
less
chocolatey
more
bitter
and
earthy
loses
some
of
the
depth
and
richness
of
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
full
and
decidedly
chewy
pretty
drinkable
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
though
porters
arent
my
favorite
but
i
could
get
in
the
mood
for
this
now
and
then
greatterrible
name
for
a
beer
pours
quite
dark
nearly
black
with
nut
brown
highlights
great
sticky
head
that
never
quite
disappears
the
aroma
is
quite
powerful
with
loads
of
roasted
malt
and
bitter
used
coffee
grounds
theres
also
a
slight
honeyish
sweetness
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
sweet
firstoff
and
that
sweet
undertone
remains
throughout
even
when
the
bitter
roasted
malts
kick
in
the
bitterness
in
this
beer
snaps
very
pleasantly
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
very
good
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
easy
to
put
down
but
also
continually
interesting
highly
recommended
and
highly
regarded
this
beer
is
bottle

of

none

in

possibly
in

worth
a
try
cheers
had
this
on
cask
at
dba
in
manhattan
a
solid
allaround
porter
very
roasty
chocolatey
flavors
melding
with
a
good
deal
of
hoppiness
that
was
almost
reminiscent
of
a
good
english
bitter
very
balanced
and
drinkable
to
the
nth
degree
on
cask
i
would
always
order
a
pint
of
this
if
i
saw
it
on
cask
for
the
money
that
it
costs
to
get
a
single
bottle
5

in
america
i
believe
that
i
would
have
been
better
off
with
something
else

somwhat
by

softly
which
makes
it

and
appropriate
at

abv
but
doesnt
really
stand
as
a
memorable
single

the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
very
slight
black
and
chocolate
malt
aroma
it
boasts
of
roasted
malts
and
english
ale
yeast
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
and
creamy
black
and
chocolate
malt
flavor
that
is
slightly
sweet
and
dry
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
porter
i
love
the
chocolate
character
but
the
carbonation
needs
to
be
less
anyway
this
is
a
fine
sessions
ale
a
good
drinker
old
slug
porter
great
name
great
label
is
one
of
the
lightest
porters
that
ive
ever
had
its
so
light
in
fact
that
it
seems
unfinished
as
if
the
brewers
sketched
the
outlines
of
a
good
beer
but
neglected
to
fill
in
the
center
to
give
it
substance
this
one
is
skippable
overall
high
carbonation
that
added
to
the
appearance
really
detracted
from
the
brew
itself
i
wont
give
up
entirely
but
will
try
to
check
out
some
notably
fresher
or
cask
versions
next
month
in
the
uk
it
may
have
lost
something
on
the
shelves
at
wells
with
all
the
other
porters
out
there
both
national
and
international
the
slug
only
stays
ahead
by
a
clever
label
and
some
other
nice
appearances
decent
amount
of
carbination
would
enjoy
it
more
with
a
bit
less
but
still
has
a
nice
feel
great
dark
tastes
of
espresso
and
hops
walnutty
bit
of
oaky
whiskey
aftertaste
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
beans
caramelly
honey
sweetness
but
nothing
that
is
too
heavy
or
cloying
very
easy
drinker
for
us
stout
and
porter
lovers
thanks
to
gclarkage
again
for
the
kickass
beers
though
a
bit
thick
and
sticky
in
the
mouthfeel
i
found
it
rather
easy
to
drink
odd
little
beer
but
id
drink
again
clean
finish
and
wide
open
nose
makes
the
beer
approachable
and
the
spices
lend
it
an
exotic
swing
that
makes
the
beer
interesting
500ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
fairly
opaque
brown
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
tight
tan
head
to
it
some
lacing
down
the
glass
some
roastiness
to
the
aroma
maybe
some
subtle
fruits
in
there
also
the
taste
is
mainly
roastiness
with
hints
of
chocolate
a
decent
porter
i
get
the
feeling
this
beer
does
not
travel
particularly
well
i
bought
mine
in
sw
england
and
it
was
great
ng
drinkability
was
good
but
not
sure
id
want
more
than
one
unique
flavors
but
didnt
make
me
crave
another
like
a
great
beer
should
i
admit
i
like
this
beer
but
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
i
had
to
pay
4
00
for
a
bottle
but
like
i
said
i
was
not
disappointed
just
not
an
everyday
beer
no
hook
up
with
anchor
sierra
nevada
or
rogue
worth
it
for
an
excursion
but
nothing
else

then
the

the

the

the

dont
score
high
drinkability

some

nice

soft

very

highly
drinkable
porter
not
big
or
thick
or
anything
soft
and
round
and
easy
to
get
into
great
bottleconditioned
mouthfeel
which
helps
provide
some
interest
to
the
palate
and
lengthen
the
finish
its
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
offers
little
reward
for
doing
so
this
beer
poured
a
large
head
that
was
tan
creamy
and
had
fine
sized
bubbles
the
hue
of
this
beer
is
dark
brown
and
the
lacing
was
fair
the
nose
was
that
of
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
and
the
flavor
was
roasted
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
light
its
very
dark
with
ruby
highlights
an
enormous
tan
head
forms
quickly
and
stays
chunky
throughout
consumption
theres
nothing
strong
in
the
aroma
just
hints
of
chocolate
and
roastiness
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
watery
but
the
taste
is
smooth
and
mellow
chocolate
and
roasty
flavors
its
mellow
for
a
porter
but
very
enjoyable
i
much
prefer
the
more
rich
and
flavorful
porters
deep
rubyhued
murky
brown
body
huge

even
on
a
careful
pour
the
yeast
was
pleasangly
active
in
this
bottle
with
excellent
retention
and
finally
settles
into
the
appearance
of
a
float
smell
of
barley
and
toasted
toffee
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
light
fruit
undertone
taste
of
toffee
with
hints

chocolate

coffee
flavor
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
bitterness
is
fairly
low
finishes
with
a

especially
for

close
to

i
think
its
just
a
touch
watery

worth
a
try
foamy

mouthfeel
is
a

thinner
than
expected
from
the
look
of
the
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
somewhat
disappointing
the
glass
i
used
may
not
have
been
rinsed
thoroughly
because
i
got
a
slight
soapy
taste
in
the
beer
ive
heard
some
beers
referred
to
as
being
a
little
soapy
but
the
guy
i
split
the
bottle
with
didnt
get
it
the
head
was
out
of
control
again
an
unthoroughly
rinsed
glass
could
explain
this
but
it
wasnt
much
smaller
on
the
glass
i
poured
my
friend
nice
roasty
maltiness
and
some
coffee
notes
like
youd
expect
from
a
porter
but
everything
was
a
little
subdued
nice
smouth
mouthfeel
with
some
body
to
it
beer
is
dark
with
bloodruby
highlights
not
bad
but
i
probably
wont
be
a
regular
drinker
overall
nothing
special
about
this
beer
i
probably
even
overrated
it
a
bit
wont
try
it
again
on
purpose
pretty
accurate
title
for
this
beer
i
kid
i
kid
seriously
though
had
a
rather
strange
taste
to
it
and
it
was
not
a
smooth
ride
going
down
pours
a
dark
brown
and
lets
a
little
light
through
along
the
edges
head
is
fizzy
and
leaves
quickly
leaving
decent
lacing
aroma
is
very
light
but
malty
taste
is
really
light
really
too
light
to
be
called
a
porter
imo
flavors
are
there
just
subdued
and
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
does
not
have
that
thickness
and
mouth
coat
of
a
porter
it
is
just
lacking
to
me
the
name
is
funny
but
it
is
a
great
tasting
porter
slight
hop
taste
flavor
but
most
of
the
flavor
is
of
dark
roasted
barley
very
nice
beer
t
lighter
than
expected
somewhat
watery
roasted
malts
mostly
chocolate
and
coffee
bread
all
in
all
a
very
decent
porter
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
no
more
no

o
a
mild
tasting
porter
easy
drinking
certainly
much
better
than

might
imagine

love
this
beer
its
like
christmas
in
a
bottle
o
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
classic
english
porter
tasty
nothing
special
about
this
beer
i
probably
even
overrated
it
a
bit
wont
try
it
again
on
purpose
overall
its
an
interesting
choice
but
not
particularly
outstanding
overall
this
is
decent
stuff
its
not
really
exciting
but
theres
a
little
interest
there
and
its
structured
in
very
much
the
way
it
should
be
in
the
end
theres
a
little
class
hiding
behind
the
gimmicky
label
at
least
overall
i
recall
this
beer
catching
flak
for
its
name
and
label
santas
nothing
if
not
humorous
so
the
state
needs
to
take
some
soma
and
drink
this
juvenile
packaging
aside
the
beer
is
a
mediumstrength
winter
warmer
that
has
me
in
a
giving
mood
long
after
the
holiday
season
overall
one
of
if
not
the
most
disappointing
porters
ive
ever
had
ive
had
bmc
light
products
with
more
flavor
i
bought
this
at
a
severe
discount
and
i
still
feel
like
i
got
ripped
off
o
fairly
sweet
porter
thin
and
leave
me
wanting
more
sickly
sweet
feeling
but
not
a
bad
beer
o
a
solid
porter
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
yearly
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
o
i
bought
this
beer
to
drink
for
christmas
thankfully
i
wasnt
aging
or
waiting
to
drink
this
beer
it
was
a
impulse
buy
and
it
will
probably
sells
more
because
of
its
name
the
beer
is
decent
not
terrible
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
id
drink
it
if
it
was
around
cheers
drinks
thin
and
flat
and
is
really
unappealling
in
every
catagory
the
good
news
is
that
the
flavor
emphasizes
the
malts
and
grains
but
on
the
whole
everything
is
way
too
subdued
weak
great
name
but
a
near
subpar
beer
d
not
bad
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
unpleasant
nothing
complex
but
enjoyable
enough
overall
the
lightness
makes
this
one
very
drinkable
its
jwhat
you
expect
for
the
style
good
name
though
i
guess
smells
and
tastes
of
fresh
baking
chocolate
with
some
lighter
soft
fruitiness
from
yeast
and
a
light
mineral
chalkiness
that
accentuates
a
sort
of
raisin
tone
combined
with
a
subtle
tangy
sour
accent
that
brings
to
mind
ye
olde
definition
of
the
english
porter
genre
too
bad
the
roasted
character
is
somewhat
lackluster
and
muddy
and
the
hopping
content
is
murky
and
indistinguishable
in
the
end
this
is
merely
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
with
funny
label
art
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
interesting
flavors
but
seems
like
it
could
use
some
bitterness
and
more
carbonation

was

for

still
pretty
good
this
6
abv
english
porter
has
enough
character
to
keep
your
palate
interested
and
searching
though
the
malt
base
at
times
seemed
pedestrian
a
slightly
richer
flavor
would
improve
upon
an
already
decent
porter
just
not
enough
here
to
hold
my
interest
the
over
drinkability
for
me
is
low
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
almost
jet
black
with
chestnut
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
and
only
the
slimmest
ring
of
bubbling
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
aromas
are
mild
with
a
solid
coffee
tone
throughout
some
lighter
malt
and
hops
scents
come
off
on
the
nose
also
flavors
are
dry
and
crisp
which
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
good
blending
of
dry
roasted
coffee
and
mild
chocolate
malts
with
a
smooth
character
and
light
smooth
body
the
aftertaste
is
rich
and
slightly
roasted
with
a
dry
feel
to
it
slow
dry
finish
leaving
a
good
linger
of
flavors
behind
good
brew
o
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
it
seems
underrated
i
received
it
for
christmas
in
a
mysterious
beer
of
the
month
box
that
a
stranger
signed
me
up
for
i
look
forward
to
drinking
the
rest
of
these
beers
and
would
recommend
it
others
i
think
im
being
generous
with
this
rating
but
since
theres
worse
out
there
average
is
appropriate
its
marketing
and
naming
are
far
better
than
the
beer
but
you
didnt
waste
your
money
kissing
your
sister
o
easily
drinkable
and
sure
not
at
all
an
unpleasant
drink
quite
warming
expecially
given
its
abv
uninteresting
the
taste
is
better
with
bitter
cocoa
and
roasted
notes
it
finishes
a
bit
more
thinly
than
id
like
but
this
beer
still
provides
a
pleasant
experience
rjt
drinkability
meh
that
is
about
it
i
was
at
the
kendall
pub
in
yorkville
il
and
they
had
plenty
of
ridgeway
brewing
bottles
for
sample
i
tried
the
santas
butt
porter
the
beer
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
with
a
deep
amber
color
that
you
can
still
see
through
there
was
a
small
slightly
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
peat
roast
and
malt
taste
is
mild
with
roast
and
peat
tones
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
light
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
beer
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
light
brown
hues
very
little
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
of
earth
booze
caramel
malts
and
toffee
taste
is
rather
light
toffee
caramel
earth
and
malts
thin
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
watery
not
much
else
going
on
malt
near
the
end
this
beer
doesnt
pack
much
flavor
overall
nothing
special
and
not
worth
having
next
xmas
o
i
like
this
a
fair
bit
as
a
nut
brown
ale
it
is
too
thin
and
lacks
roastiness
for
a
porter
though
if
it
didnt
say
porter
on
the
label
it
wouldnt
have
occurred
to
me
that
this
was
anything
but
a
darkly
colored
brown
ale
overall
not
one
of
the
more
exciting
porters
out
there
not
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
is
enjoyable
as
a
nice
everyday
beer
making
it
out
to
be
a
winter
porter
doesnt
help
its
cause
sampled
on
december
3
2011
the
pour
is
dark
chestnutamber
with
no
head
but
good
clarity
lots
of
sweet
roasted
malts
in
the
aroma
along
with
sugar
and
a
nip
of
laid
back
hops
the
bodu
is
in
the
medium
range
and
also
rather
smooth
and
creamy
it
definitely
espouses
a
pleasant
bitter
flavor
but
it
really
reminds
me
of
most
sweet
british
esbs
which
always
seem
to
have
this
soft
water
characteristic
and
lots
of
approachable
flavor
theres
a
very
tart
aftertaste
just
not
a
good
porter
nor
a
good
winter
offering
its
not
bad
its
just
meh
drinkability
i
felt
was
good
light
flavors
good
on
style
and
no
signs
of
abv
overall
i
am
very
excited
about
this
beer
and
this
brewery
in
general
i
tend
to
grade
under
the
average
but
for
the
three
christmas
ales
ive
had
from
rb
i
have
ranked
them
a
bit
higher
than
others
slainte
overall
this
beer
lacked
the
character
of
a
good
porter
which
places
it
in
my
average
column
the
best
part
of
the
beer
was
the
name
and
label
o
disappointing
porter
but
not
too
bad
overall
i
would
not
recommend
it
no
complexity
at
all
finish
is
watery
and
extremely
short
not
one
to
try
and
would
never
recommend
a
slightly
below
average
porter
that
goes
down
easy
but
doesnt
really
leave
you
craving
another
one
finger
head
of
light
brown
foam
with
good
clinging
lace
color
is
a
35
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
aromas
of
coffee
chocolate
toffee
caramel
currant
and
roasted
malt
flavors
are
chocolate
dark
roasted
coffee
toffee
caramel
and
malt
thick
creamy
body
in
my
mouth
with
good
carbonation
too
heavy
for
drinking
more
that
a
couple
at
a
sitting
but
would
be
good
with
cheese
and
cake
d
i
dont
think
i
would
trade
a
sam
smith
s
taddy
porter
or
a
fullers
porter
for
this
one
notes
not
terrible
but
it
lacks
depth
and
roundness
its
just
too
sweet
and
estery
not
enough
roasted
malts
and
not
quite
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
there
are
a
great
many
beers
i
would
prefer
over
this
one
not
waht
i
was
expecting
no
real
coffee
roastiness
and
overall
pretty
meh
from
winter
brew
tasting
notes
2010
pours
clear
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
this
beer
smells
of
sugar
molasses
and
oddly
enough
a
light
lager
maybe
natty
light
the
flavor
in
this
beer
is
definitely
lacking
a
little
bit
especially
for
a
winter
porter
the
nose
is
slightly
bitter
but
it
has
an
ambiguously
sweet
aftertaste
d
flavorful
smooth
and
rich
not
as
much
character
as
i
hoped
for
no
snifter
pour
and
i
am
met
with
a
dark
brown
ale
and
burgandy
highlights
when
brought
up
to
the
light
the
aroma
consists
of
some
light
malts
and
fruit
orange
plum
the
taste
is
somewhat
spicy
with
a
dose
of
toffee
and
slight
caramel
there
is
a
bite
at
the
end
on
the
swallow
and
long
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
too
thin
for
my
liking
it
comes
in
at
6
though
its
drinkable
i
was
hoping
for
something
of
a
coffeelike
nature
and
i
got
nothing
again
this
seems
more
like
a
brown
ale
along
the
lines
of
a
newcastle
but
with
a
better
body
and
a
bit
better
taste
definitely
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
porter
scale
bottle
at
the
december
santa
cruz
tasting
pours
a
clear
chestnut
color
with
some
tan
foam
aroma
is
brown
malts
with
a
touch
of
smoke
a
bit
of
caramel
and
roast
in
the
flavor
plus
milk
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
sourness
medium
bodied
very
english
pretty
generic
with
the
moderate
alcohol
levels
and
unobtrusive
taste
and
smell
you
could
easy
drink
this
all
night
long
it
goes
down
easy
with
no
offensive
qualities
the
is
actually
quite
drinkable
to
me
i
do
not
think
there
is
one
strength
but
perhaps
reasonable
presentations
of
each
part
that
suits
my
palate
verdict
an
enjoyable
one
timer
for
me
but
there
are
so
many
christmas
seasonal
beers
out
there
this
one
didnt
have
quite
the
kick
and
flavor
diversity
i
was
looking
for
good
for
some
worth
a
shot
for
most
im
torn
on
whether
id
get
it
again
b
3

pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
seems
like
a
porter
and
a
nut
brown
mixed
some
sweet
earthy
notes
malty
undertones
the
taste
starts
sweet
and
malty
with
the
sweetness
ringing
out
till
the
aftertaste
that
has
a
hint
of
alcohol
with
a
very
subtle
roasted
malt
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
almost
medium
but
still
leaves
something
to
be
desired
not
super
smooth
but
still
an
easy
drinker
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
enjoyable
a
nice
winter
warmer
nice
id
drink
santas
butt
again
flavors
were
pedestrian
some
coffee
some
cocoa
for
an
ep
i
expected
some
bite
hops
something
then
again
the
category
on
here
could
be
wrong
either
way
its
average
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
d
a
classic
english
porter
very
drinkable
flavors
are
delicious
but
restrained
could
easily
enjoy
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
as
a
bonus
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
open
up
into
additional
fruitbased
flavors
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
most
american
porters
are
really
junior
stouts
this
beer
does
a
great
job
of
showing
off
what
it
means
to
be
a
true
porter
d
this
is
a
solid
english
porter
allaround
bottle
procured
in
the
middle
of
bumfuk
no
where
maryland
an
ugly
water
pour
light
brown
with
a
little
carbonation
doesnt
look
great
the
aroma
is
light
stale
coffee
alcohol
and
a
little
hops
the
taste
is
horrendous
can
barely
drink
half
a
glass
of
this
stale
coffee
not
roasty
at
all
lots
of
alcohol
d
i
guess
i
coulda
summed
it
up
in
the
last
paragraph
butt
good
beer
drinkers
that
expect
something
from
a
porter
and
have
a
benchmark
for
a
style
andor
something
they
wish
to
receive
this
will
not
do
it
for
ya
experimenters
and
people
that
are
trying
to
drink
something
different
around
the
holidays
or
whenever
give
it
a
shot
you
might
like
it
bmc
fans
who
got
this
in
their
stocking
go
for
it
but
me
i
say
although
it
tastes
fresh
and
all
which
definitely
earns
some
points
in
the
time
of
year
when
i
jones
for
dark
hearty
brews
im
disappointed
in
this
one
put
me
on
the
naughty
list
bitch
i
dont
care
after
all
that
rambling
i
will
conclude
this
yuletide
tale
by
saying
that
i
could
drink
at
max
47
of
these
high
drinkability
for
me
as
this
went
down
easy
and
had
enough
flavor
complexities
to
enjoy
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
beer
a
strong
recommendation
for
any
porter
fan
or
any
fan
of
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
in
a
beer
very
very
dark
mahagonay
reddish
brown
color
no
head
very
tiny
ring
around
edge
of
glass
very
chocolatey
malty
aroma
roasty
start
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
finish
roasted
aftertaste
medium
body
semithin
on
the
tongue
carbonation
seems
on
the
high
side
adding
to
the
thinness
not
super
complex
but
a
good
basic
quite
nice
doesnt
sit
super
heavy
actually
a
bit
too
sweet
and
little
bitter
for
me
dr
very
easy
d
aside
from
the
thin
taste
this
isnt
a
bad
porter
having
said
that
i
would
not
wait
all
year
just
to
have
this
as
a
holiday
beer
the
beer
overall
is
too
bad
well
put
together
porter
with
good
flavors
good
beer
great
name
and
i
had
to
admit
that
influenced
the
purchase
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
because
of
the
expense
but
it
is
a
solid
porter
its
rich
and
warms
the
tongue
as
it
layers
with
flavors
of
chocolate
malts
it
does
have
a
smooth
hop
balance
and
is
a
high
quality
porter
fairly
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
im
going
to
seek
out
d
a
good
drinker
had
this
on
tap
at
the
other
side
in
boston
enjoyed
it
a
lot
but
did
not
take
notes
and
was
psyched
to
see
it
for
sale
a
few
weeks
later
a
block
away
at
bauer
wine
and
spirits
on
newbury
funny
label
and
story
on
it
was
a
bit
disappointed
though
pours
thin
dark
brown
to
black
and
opaque
in
the
middle
looks
like
cocacola
on
the
sides
minimal
head
which
dissipated
immediately
smell
is
very
faint
fruity
root
beer
taste
is
pretty
good
hints
of
smokiness
coffee
tobacco
and
cherries
feel
is
thin
as
predicted
by
the
pour
very
thin
for
a
porter
minimal
carbonation
pretty
easy
drinking
perhaps
too
easy
for
a
winter
porter
would
get
it
on
tap
if
i
saw
it
again
but
not
in
the
bottle
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
notes
of
chocolate
taste
is
mild
some
malts
and
chocolate
finishing
slightly
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
beer
drinkability
very
easy
drinkability
a
nice
beer
for
the
holiday
season
enjoyable
d
its
a
really
good
beer
but
may
start
to
weigh
you
down
after
a
couple
d
just
fine
for
the
style
and
for
the
beer
itself
again
here
not
inspirational
in
terms
of
drinkability

d
despite
the
mediocre
reviews
before
this
one
i
find
this
beer
to
be
quite
nice
a
solid
example
of
the
style
pours
dark
brown
with
a
very
small
head
the
aroma
is
very
very
faint
with
some
malty
sweetness
the
flavor
is
just
simply
not
very
good
i
get
a
strong
medicinal
flavor
and
no
real
roasted
malts
or
anything
else
you
would
expect
in
a
porter
not
sure
if
something
is
amiss
in
this
beer
or
if
it
is
just
not
very
good
but
i
barely
finished
a
4
oz
sample
low
to
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
good
solid
drinkable
porter
a
nice
easy
drinking
holiday
ale
that
is
full
of
flavor
and
relatively
low
in
alcohol
for
a
holiday
beer
nice
clear
cola
brown
with
tan
head
a
lace
a
sweet
toffee
and
malt
aroma
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
a
bit
of
molasses
a
yeasty
fruitiness
and
mild
finish
some
toasted
dark
bread
lingers
a
light
warming
from
the
invisible
alcohol
a
little
light
on
feel
but
a
nice
light
carbonation
you
can
enjoy
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
quite
pleasant
on
a
cold
evening
warming
and
restorative
with
a
quenching
quality
mouthfeel
was
zippy
carbonation
with
a
smooth
finish
this
felt
like
a
high
carbonation
beer
light
and
watery
on
tongue
with
a
slight
non
pine
bitterness
at
the
finish
good
but
i
was
expecting
more
than
just
a
simple
porter
more
spices
that
would
convied
santa
and
christmas
d
smooth
and
drinkable
just
not
my
favorite
but
could
drink
a
few
d
ok
actually
a
little
one
note
and
very
sweet
but
still
drinkable
it
does
not
taste
at
all
like
an
english
porter
but
still
is
pretty
drinkable
drinkability
a
little
light
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
but
way
too
light
this
drinks
like
a
scottish
ale
and
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
so
in
that
case
this
is
very
drinkable
comparing
this
to
an
english
porter
is
not
fair
medium
body
offdry
finish
it
was
drinkable
but
went
down
fairly
carelessly
no
voices
inside
the
beer
calling
out
to
me
the
memory
of
its
taste
fades
quickly
overall
well
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
other
new
winter
brews
d
decent
enough
but
not
very
complex
another
very
drinkable
holiday
brew
by
ridgeway
d
moderate
drinkability
carbonation
gets
to
me
as
i
drink
it
both
in
an
unpleasant
mouthfeel
and
filling
my
stomach
abv
is
a
bit
potent
appears
a
pitch
black
tone
at
first
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
toward
the
light
aroma
is
upfront
with
dark
fruits
and
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
chocolate
coffee
and
mild
cherry
nice
flavor
has
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
blended
with
a
bit
of
christmas
spunk
including
dark
fruits
and
other
variables
into
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
solid
medium
bodied
even
carbonation
drinkability
is
solid
all
around
solid
drinking
christmas
ale
i
look
forward
to
more
of
singular
a
bit
smoky
for
my
taste
and
not
enough
alcohol
for
the
winter
warmer
style
curious
to
try
a
fresh
one
of
these
to
see
the
difference
held
up
pretty
good
to
age
and
can
only
guess
what
a
good
one
tastes
like
drinkability
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
its
too
over
carbonated
and
syrupy
no
distinct
or
unique
flavors
and
overall
just
pretty
light
highly
recommended
if
you
can
spot
one
a
dark
coffee
mahogany
color
with
a
whispy
dirty
tan
head
and
a
modest
lace
the
aroma
is
a
mild
coffee
chocolate
malt
the
taste
is
a
bit
sour
coffee
bean
and
vanilla
medium
body
that
is
fairly
drinkable
for
the
style
there
is
the
prefunctory
touch
of
charcoal
smooth
and
agreeable
for
a
winter
brew
feel
and
drinkability
as
aforementioned
this
one
feels
a
bit
watery
on
the
palate
thin
like
butter
scraped
over
too
much
bread
flavor
in
the
mouth
is
fleeting
but
the
aftertaste
and
roasty
flavor
hangs
around
for
a
bit
id
like
if
this
were
a
bit
heavier
if
it
had
some
more
body
and
weight
in
the
mouth
carbonation
is
right
for
this
style
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
i
can
see
myself
buying
this
again
however
this
isnt
a
porter
id
turn
to
when
i
want
something
really
good
its
a
nice
beer
but
not
something
id
seek
out
pretty
much
average
ive
had
many
that
are
better
and
ive
also
had
worse
d
i
would
have
another
if
offered
though
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
conclusion
not
a
bad
stout
but
the
labels
the
coolest
thing
about
this
beer
in
the
end
its
not
bad
but
its
definitely
not
worth
the
5
dollars
a
bottle
nice
drinkable
ale
and
better
than
i
expected
from
my
experience
with
lump
of
coal
good
beer
go
buy
some
d
was
decently
enjoyable
to
drink
but
it
lacked
the
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
that
i
expect
from
winter
brews
the
flavor
was
also
a
bit
weak
i
paired
the
latter
half
with
food
and
its
weakness
really
came
out
then
i
wont
turn
down
another
but
i
wont
pay
for
one
either
i
poured
from
a
16
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
moderate
white
head
there
are
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
sun
the
aroma
was
roasted
malt
not
very
strong
the
flavor
was
slightly
bitter
and
had
hints
of
coffee
the
sweeter
notes
win
out
the
body
was
a
bit
light
and
the
carbonation
was
average
a
beer
that
can
be
easily
quaffed
drinkability
just
wasnt
impressed
with
this
smelled
better
than
it
tasted
wont
be
buying
ever
again
d
unimpressed
with
the
overall
package
the
abv
is
reasonable
for
warmerstyle
porter
the
appearance
is
very
dark
with
a
slight
mahogany
hue
when
put
to
the
light
initial
there
is
a
nice
creamy
head
which
dissipates
almost
immediately
i
would
describe
the
aroma
as
musty
almost
like
a
wet
sock
not
that
i
smell
a
lot
of
wet
socks
but
if
i
had
to
imagine
what
they
smell
like
this
would
be
it
i
did
like
upfront
toasted
malt
flavor
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
hop
presence
but
then
again
this
is
a
porter
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
with
a
somewhat
disagreeable
aroma
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
dark
mahogany
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
subdued
coffee
beans
and
barley
malt
with
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
and
oak
it
tasted
like
watereddown
coffee
and
earthy
barley
malt
with
prominent
copper
hops
it
was
thin
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
very
metallic
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
decent
porter
very
british
and
metallic
it
tasted
good
but
not
great
and
had
a
decent
body
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
was
generally
not
exciting
not
bad
but
from
a
christmas
beer
you
can
expect
some
more
characterization
a
decent
one
in
the
ridgeway
line
body
is
too
thin
for
the
depth
of
color
nothing
special
here
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
weak
head
the
nose
has
roasty
malts
and
a
touch
of
cocao
the
taste
is
equally
unimpressive
not
bad
just
a
bit
light
for
the
style
light
body
has
decent
carbonation
good
brew
to
wash
down
some
fish
and
chips
but
thats
about
it
taste
is
a
little
creamy
milk
chocolate
coffee
and
some
malt
ends
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
quite
easy
to
drink
i
just
wish
there
was
a
stronger
flavor
not
bad
but
im
not
running
out
to
buy
a
fridge
full
da
fine
brew
enjoyable
more
for
the
novelty
of
the
beers
name
than
for
the
quality
of
the
beer
however
still
a
decent
brew
m
medium
bodied
quite
good
mouthcoating
pleasant
amount
of
carbonation
which
teases
the
mouth
without
overpowering
it
i
bought
this
beer
on
a
whim
the
unusual
name
must
have
caught
my
attention
the
beer
pours
deep
dark
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
wispy
head
that
quickly
disappeared
fairly
light
in
the
aroma
with
caramel
malt
and
some
dark
sweet
malt
lurking
in
the
background
fairly
light
on
the
palate
for
the
style
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
with
some
coffee
notes
shining
through
finishes
about
as
uneventful
as
it
begins
this
beer
lacks
the
complexity
and
depth
that
i
prefer
is
a
winter
warmer
i
poured
this
funny
labeled
big
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
color
of
the
beer
was
black
and
it
had
a
ice
head
at
first
it
was
not
long
though
that
the
head
dissapeared
to
nothingness
the
lacing
eas
fair
though
the
smell
was
of
caramell
and
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
will
buy
again
d
overall
a
lightmoderate
drinking
english
porter
with
a
nice
coffee
display
when
drank
at
the
proper
temperature
500
ml
bottle
from
the
bayou
pours
a
pure
black
color
with
a
medium
white
head
rich
roasted
aromas
some
chocolates
and
light
caramel
in
the
nose
also
the
taste
is
very
nice
very
quaffable
smooth
and
full
flavors
of
roasted
malts
caramel
light
and
sweet
fruits
and
chocolates
very
enjoyable
dnot
bad
but
a
bit
lackluster
id
think
of
this
more
as
a
fall
beer
than
a
winter
seasonal
not
going
to
run
out
to
buy
another
anytime
this
season
it
doesnt
taste
like
kris
kringles
ass
to
be
sure
but
this
isnt
a
knockout
porter
by
any
means
not
bad
but
taddy
porter
it
aint
drinkability
probably
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
tried
very
quaffable
easy
to
drink
at
only
6
00
abv
this
is
a
porter
you
can
enjoy
around
the
holidays
good
beer
to
look
forward
to
around
the
holidays
not
something
i
would
buy
on
the
regular
but
defintley
a
porter
you
can
enjoy
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
there
are
just
better
examples
i
really
enjoy
the
english
porters
but
this
just
doesnt
compare
to
stuff
like
tadcaster
fullers
and
meantime
subdued
aroma
primarily
semisweet
malts
with
some
bitterness
dark
amber
pour
solid
tan
head
and
minimal
lacing
medium
to
light
on
the
palate
for
a
porter
but
there
is
a
richness
in
the
finish
that
helps
smooth
this
one
out
a
bit
light
toasty
flavor
with
some
roasted
malts
complimented
by
some
molasses
and
brown
sugar
flavors
a
touch
of
coffee
reminds
me
of
a
couple
english
strong
ales
ive
recently
had
the
drinkability
is
so
so
not
really
worth
it
unless
you
are
hard
up
for
a
new
review
mk
a
mild
beer
with
no
off
flavors
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
offwhite
creamy
head
some
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
big
on
malts
lots
of
toffeecaramel
the
tasty
is
slightly
sweet
malty
toffeecaramel
medium
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
but
would
most
likely
not
seek
again
for
starters
im
gonna
review
this
beer
as
a
dark
ale
rather
than
a
porter
it
lacks
a
lot
of
porter
qualities
this
beer
poured
a
dark
burgundy
color
once
again
it
would
be
a
nice
looking
dark
ale
it
had
a
nice
dark
chocolate
smell
with
a
touch
of
bread
it
definitely
lacked
the
porter
smokiness
in
taste
it
really
has
a
dark
chocolate
taste
with
some
raisin
bread
qualities
the
aftertaste
is
where
you
really
taste
the
alcohol
at
6
0
abv
the
alcohol
taste
should
be
nonexistent
this
beer
was
very
watery
for
a
porter
i
would
drink
this
again
but
at
6
a
bottle
there
are
better
options
the
taste
is
much
worse
almost
nothing
but
prunes
and
alcohol
with
faint
hints
of
red
wine
and
chocolate
the
body
isnt
too
thin
but
it
is
not
complex
at
all
and
is
really
very
bland
for
a
porter
tasting
pretty
much
just
of
alcoholsoaked
prunes
it
is
far
too
bland
and
alcoholic
however
it
is
drinkable
and
some
enjoyable
feel
and
warmth
pours
a
cola
color
brown
with
a
big
fizzy
head
that
fades
quickly
little
carbonation
if
any
at
all
smell
is
lightly
of
chocolate
and
cocoa
a
pinch
of
caramel
mild
hop
bitterness
taste
certainly
carries
on
with
similar
flavors
but
an
english
hop
bitterness
gets
to
me
its
kind
of
chalky
and
dry
there
is
a
sweetness
to
the
beer
but
its
hard
to
enjoy
with
the
bitter
flavor
that
lingers
some
nice
chocolate
caramel
and
even
light
hints
of
oat
but
overshadowed
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
thin
without
much
body
low
on
carbonation
and
overall
substance
its
a
struggle
to
finish
this
bottle
not
one
ill
be
coming
back
to
sorry
to
say
solid
allaround
porter
with
a
taste
of
molasses
and
a
touchup
of
dark
cocoa
its
worth
a
look
if
youre
into
porters
though
at
its
4
99
pricetag
i
cant
see
myself
putting
that
money
down
again
on
this
with
so
many
better
beers
out
there
not
outstanding
but
fairly
good
ive
had
this
beer
for
a
few
months
i
finally
decided
to
give
it
a
whirl
what
a
joke
no
lacing
on
head
looked
thin
and
watery
smelled
a
tad
sweet
and
chocolately
but
very
diluted
tasted
like
water
was
flat
maybe
a
bad
batch
the
finish
there
wasnt
one
easily
the
worst
porter
ive
ever
had
what
a
waste
of
money
because
i
love
porters
d
a
nice
porter
beer
but
nothing
really
special
about
it
to
make
me
buy
it
for
4
99
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
on
the
cheap
after
the
christmas
season
like
i
did
d
this
was
an
okay
porter
nothing
from
ridgeway
has
really
blown
me
away
drinkability
soso
and
that
says
alot
about
the
taste
if
the
mouthfeel
matched
the
taste
and
smell
i
could
drink
this
everyday
and
maybe
maybe
even
say
it
is
my
favorite
porter
alas
mouthfeel
is
very
important
finish
is
somewhat
short
dark
brown
with
mahogany
highlights
one
inch
creamy
tan
foam
that
dissipates
fast
aroma
is
light
and
taste
is
thin
has
kind
of
a
bitter
cola
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thin
overall
this
is
not
terrible
by
any
means
but
i
have
had
many
better
beers
than
this
and
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
despite
the
cool
name
overall
its
okay
but
it
isnt
anything
impressive
and
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
an
easy
drinking
light
porter
not
bad
drinks
easy
just
not
very
interesting

not
my

drinkability
very
little

watery
and
thin
much
too
sweet
i
thought
this
one
had
some
potential
but
it
seems
like
just
another
gimmick
presentation
packaged
in
a
sixteenounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
another
christmas
beer
but
one
due
to
labeling
rather
than
typical
christmas
spicing
the
label
is
the
best
thing
about
this
lackluster
porter
the
beer
pours
thin
and
light
brown
but
ends
up
moderately
dark
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
chocolate
and
coffee
on
the
nose
however
both
smell
watered
down
or
somewhat
diminished
the
flavor
is
weak
some
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
flavor
but
there
is
very
little
in
the
way
of
dominant
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
unremarkable
a
disappointing
beer
at
best
i
would
not
drink
this
again
unless
it
was
on
draught
not
recommended
i
have
been
saving
this
beer
for
christmas
eve
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
kind
of
the
color
of
cocacola
a
small
white
head
faded
quickly
the
smell
is
very
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
also
very
sweet
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
the
aftertaste
is
a
light
bitter
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
this
with
some
almostfizzy
carbonation
a

novelty
beer
for
the
season
but
nothing

chocolate
and
mustiness
enter
the
palate
first
followed
by
a
bittersweet
nutty
flavor
and
english
hops
slight
metallic
taste
is
left
on
the
tongue
it
doesnt
deviate
too
far
from
your
typical
english
porter
but
thats
not
always
a
bad
thing
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
liking
novel
name
and
an
interesting
conversation
piece
but
a
bit
pricey
5
25
for
what
amounts
to
a
standard
brit
porter
worth
a
shot
though
after
all
tis
the
season
overall
this
is
an
innocent
beer
that
doesnt
do
anything
wrong
no
flaws
but
nothing
unusual
either
not
an
overwhelming
brew
but
fun
nice
novelty
beer
around
christmas
but
not
a
great
beer
should
be
way
down
on
the
list
of
porters
to
try
this
porter
or
so
called
holiday
porter
is
dissapointing
it
pours
real
thin
with
a
head
too
white
the
nose
is
almost
non
existent
the
taste
has
that
classic
ridgeway
dirty
tank
flavor
some
hints
of
malt
and
coffee
but
far
too
thin
to
be
a
porter
much
less
a
holiday
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
not
creamy
in
the
last
it
has
a
lager
feel
some
people
like
these
beers
alot
and
if
its
your
thing
im
sorry
but
i
just
cant
get
into
them
the
bottles
are
cool
but
i
just
cant
see
myself
buying
any
of
these
beers
again
except
maybe
the
insanely
bad
elf
cheers
the
label
and
name
alone
make
this
beer
worth
trying
this
dark
brown
brew
has
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
eventually
disappears
some
light
chocolate
and
smoked
wood
in
the
smell
taste
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
but
solid
with
some
burnt
coffee
notes
and
chocolate
malts
not
all
that
thick
or
full
bodied
though
sweet
with
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
very
drinkable
and
not
heavy
enough
that
you
cant
have
another
worth
a
try

been
cold
here
in
lincoln
with
about
5
inches
of
snow
on

ground
for
december
thats
a
good
amount
so
i
was
kinda
in
the
christmas
mood
when
i
bought
this
yesterday
4

at
the
still
an
ok
beer
i
may
buy
one
more
for
christmas
if
there
are
any
left
i
picked
up
this
brew
on
a
whim
mainly
due
to
the
name
and
the
label
on
popping
the
cap
i
enjoyed
a
nice
sweet
smell
that
you
get
with
a
porter
i
poured
it
into
a
frosted
beer
stein
and
got
a
dark
brown
pour
with
a
light
brown
one
finger
head
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
were
average
for
a
porter
not
great
but
not
bad
poured
a
dark
brown
with
no
foam
or
lace
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
was
the
aroma
that
i
picked
up
upon
first
sniff
the
flavor
was
of
weak
roasted
malts
and
weak
whatever
this
porter
was
made
up
as
not
a
lot
of
flavor
just
drinking
flavored
malty
water
this
was
a
great

for
this

dont

if

to
have
more
than
a

of

o
the
sourdough
rye
flavors
in
this
brew
diminished
from
what
i
like
in
a
roasty
porter
a
decent
brew
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
a
founders
porter
wifes
review
oh
its
very
good
it
is
kind
of
fruity
isnt
it
delicious
fortunately
for
me
this
was
my
first
step
outside
of
the
standard
domestic
beers
as
the
bottle
says
youre
hit
with
a
wonderfully
rich
flavor
of
chocolate
which
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
to
me
that
is
followed
by
a
creamy
body
it
is
ended
with
a
slight
bright
of
rye
which
continues
to
put
a
smile
on
my
face
with
every
sip
i
hope
to
edit
this
as
my
palate
evolves
so
that
i
may
do
this
wonderful
find
in
a
sea
of
selections
the
justice
i
am
sure
it
deserves
i
can
say
that
i
am
so
impressed
that
a
weekend
sabbatical
to
the
brewery
in
nashville
has
been
scheduled
o
worth
trying
overall
very
nice
porter
favorable
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
only
knock
really
is
the
lack
of
any
good
head
o
really
solid
porter
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
most
of
the
mixed
yazoo
sixer
i
received
from
a
friend
in
nashville
o
this
beer
fits
right
in
with
the
sam
smiths
beers
this
is
a
great
english
porter
it
is
loaded
with
aroma
and
flavor
this
beer
exceeded
all
expectations
o
a
solid
porter
great
with
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
nice
dessert
beer
m
light
to
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
i
think
that
yazoo
does
a
great
job
of
making
solid
beers
that
most
people
would
approve
of
but
i
think
that
drinkability
is
too
important
for
them
in
most
of
their
core
beers
i
would
love
to
see
them
just
crank
it
to
11
and
see
what
happens
i
know
they
want
to
overall
great
balanced
porter
but
wish
it
had
a
higher
abv
and
it
would
be
a
truly
outstanding
beer
just
a
little
too
watered
down
for
my
liking
you
can
thank
tennessee
beer
laws
for
that
one
id
rather
have
yazoos
sue
anyday
even
though
thats
not
a
porter
not
too
bad
i
like
it
better
as
it
warms
up
pretty
dismal
appearance
though
nice
feel
good
balance
medium
body
good
drinkability
a
nice
rye
porter
overall
this
beer
was
great
it
was
unlike
any
other
porter
ive
had
before
because
it
seemed
much
more
dark
fruit
forward
than
roasted
it
was
semisweet
but
no
where
near
too
sweet
im
glad
i
tried
this
while
in
nashville
a
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
light
cocoa
taste
begins
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
some
chocolate
next
was
some
sweet
grain
and
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
quite
good
porter
the
spiciness
of
he
rye
works
well
here
a
buddy
brought
a
variety
pack
back
from
a
trip
to
nashville
the
beer
pours
a
nice
color
which
was
slightly
less
dark
than
guinness
with
a
tan
head
the
rye
was
indeed
sly
the
beer
wasnt
as
astringent
as
i
had
anticipated
while
not
as
bitter
as
i
would
expect
from
a
porter
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
purchase
it
if
i
found
it
in
my
part
of
the
country
reminds
me
of
a
guiness
extra
stout
no
real
flaws
but
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
porter
to
be
honest
i
expected
a
little
more
out
of
the
taste
has
a
burnt
roast
feel
to
it
with
a
somewhat
flat
finish
even
for
a
porter
the
rye
does
shine
through
which
is
its
one
lone
saving
grace
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
i
could
use
a
few
of
these
on
a
chilly
autumn
night
overall
i
liked
it
as
a
session
beer
was
somewhat
let
down
because
the
yazoo
sue
is
an
incredibly
rich
smoked
porter
very
bold
with
lots
of
body
and
flavor
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
similar
but
it
was
toned
down
still
i
liked
it
there
arent
too
many
porters
widely
available
in
the
middle
of
tennessee
will
drink
it
again
overall
i
enjoy
the
sly
rye
porter
and
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
it
up
again
but
it
isnt
incredible
ive
had
a
couple
other
rye
porters
that
i
prefer
but
they
are
almost
impossible
for
me
to
get

poured
a
dark
black

a
dark
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing

consists
of
spicy
rye
notes
with
light
roasted
malt
and
some
black
chocolate
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
spicy
rye
notes
with
some
dry
roasted
m
alt
notes
with
light
black
chocolate
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
well
brewed
with
rye
contributing
some
interesting
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
great
mouthfeel
for
the
style
overall
it
was
a
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
beer
i
really
liked
the
little
bit
of
rye
flavor
in
it
very
solid
beer
all
around
especially
for
the
style
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
o
very
sweet
but
the
profile
manages
to
handle
it
the
rye
is
a
really
nice
touch
o
i
have
had
rye
ipas
and
rye
stouts
but
this
was
the
first
rye
porter
i
have
tasted
this
sets
a
pretty
good
standard
imo
i
hope
i
can
score
some
more
in
the
future

wow
is
this
dark
very
nice

spicy

flavor
is
light
chocolatey

with
a
small
amount
of

mouthfeel

but
this
makes
it
drinkable
overall
effect
is
that
i
would
have
this
again
but
it
is
not
on
my
shopping
list
anytime
soon
maybe
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
encourage
porter
lovers
to
give
it
a
shot
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
bought
2
and
im
trading
one
as
an
extra
tempted
to
drink
it
though
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
good
enough
to
be
a
desert
treat
yet
light
enough
to
be
an
anytime
of
the
day
beer
as
well
overall
this
porter
is
interesting
carrying
some
unique
flavors
for
the
style
it
is
drinkable
and
works
well
across
the
palate
a
bit
too
spritzy
on
the
tongue
taking
away
from
what
could
be
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
but
on
the
whole
this
porter
works
well
o
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
think
it
both
one
of
the
better
beers
that
yazoo
does
and
one
of
the
better
porters
available
in
the
nashville
market
its
a
shame
that
bottles
are
only
sold
as
part
of
the
yazoo
mixed
12
pack
i
would
certainly
drink
more
of
this
if
that
were
not
the
case
on
tap
from
the
brewery
in
a
sampler
a
chocolaty
cloudy
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
and
nice
lace
the
smell
was
of
chocolate
banana
clove
spice
pepper
and
a
hint
of
roast
the
taste
followed
the
nose
a
chocolate
covered
banana
with
spicy
elements
throughout
spicy
rye
black
pepper
banana
cloves
and
chocolate
with
hints
of
coffee
and
roasted
qualities
a
complex
but
light
beer
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
on
the
watery
side
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
in
the
swallow
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
easy
to
drink
flavor
is
very
similar
malt
driven
and
spicy
with
the
rye
component
blending
seamlessly
with
the
creamy
milk
chocolate
of
the
porter
side
of
things
medium
bodied
slightly
dense
from
the
malt
content
easily
sipped
or
quaffed
interesting
balance
of
rye
and
chocolate
malt
here
more
sweet
than
bitter
but
not
overly
so
definitely
worth
a
try
its
a
different
animal
than
sue
o
very
good
beer
from
yazoo
if
you
like
porters
you
have
to
give
this
a
try
highly
recomended
excellent
beer
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
in
a
while
packing
this
much
flavor
into
a
brew
under
6
abv
is
always
to
be
applauded
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
this
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
because
it
tastes
great
i
will
probably
be
a
regular
in
the
beer
store
getting
growlers
of
this
also
want
to
mention
that
i
made
a
great
barbecue
sauce
with
this
beer
was
actually
looking
for
sue
but
they
didnt
have
it
so
i
settled
for
this
was
a
good
choice
imo
d
could
and
have
drank
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
yazoo
offerings
d
this
porter
is
incredibly
drinkable
sweet
and
dark
without
any
harsh
bitter
flavors
i
love
the
rye
d
this
is
a
really
good
easy
drinking
flavorful
porter
the
dark
fruits
and
rye
add
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
the
style
helping
this
stand
out
from
others
in
this
class
thanks
to
beerindex
for
this
one
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
well
done
one
of
the
best
offerings
ive
had
from
yazoo
d
a
solid
porter
an
attempt
at
including
rye
is
appreciated
and
more
or
less
well
executed
a
few
tweaks
and
this
could
be
great
beer
a
very
good
porter
and
im
not
sure
ive
ever
had
one
with
rye
a
good
stand
up
beer
well
made
well
rounded
and
definitely
worth
a
sixpack
at
least
recommended
think
i
would
pass
on
this
if
there
was
a
next
time
to
try
it
d
this
beer
drinks
easy
and
smooth
for
the
most
part
the
watery
at
times
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
good
drinkability
beer
meaning
you
can
have
a
ton
of
this
abv
is
low
so
drinking
a
lot
wouldnt
be
a
problem
as
well
overall
a
above
average
beer
but
not
by
much
a
good
beer
and
one
that
im
happy
to
pick
up
when
i
get
the
chance
linus
sure
knows
what
hes
doing
beer
is
thin
at
leadoff
and
finishes
really
weak
there
is
a
minimal
sweetness
almost
nothing
in
the
midpalate
and
some
rye
and
roast
at
the
end
that
disappears
quickly
not
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
see
having
several
of
these
in
a
row
a
solid
porter
overall
overall
a
highly
complex
porter
without
any
smugness
or
fakeness
this
baby
screams
northern
michigan
even
though
its
brewed
in
nashville
i
really
like
how
balanced
and
still
offset
this
ale
is
good
job
nashville
overall
it
is
an
alright
porter
the
nose
was
the
most
enjoyable
part
of
the
beer
the
taste
just
wasnt
there
fairly
average
still
a
nice
beer
could
be
a
great
autumn
grilling
out
football
beer
a
decent
porter
would
go
well
with
smoked
barbecue
a
nice
beer
for
a
fall
night
with
a
nice
meal
worth
trying
it
if
your
looking
for
a
bit
of
a
change
from
other
porters
hv
d
pretty
good
not
the
best
of
the
yazoo
brews
i
have
had
sue
rocks
but
it
is
tasty
no
doubt
nice
smooth
fuller
body
with
this
one
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
this
would
make
a
nice
autumn
beer
for
the
cooler
nights
out
on
the
deck
thanks
jim
eventually
goes
completely
flat
the
first
half
of
the
glass
was
much
more
enjoyable
than
the
second
which
i
ended
up
pouring
down
the
drain
second
one
of
these
and
both
the
same
way
even
at
its
best
i
see
this
more
as
a
brown
ale
or
even
a
scotch
ale
but
pretty
weak
for
a
porter
and
a
below
average
beer
regardless
of
style
overall
a
decent
beer
from
yazoo
nothing
overly
exciting
but
still
a
fairly
drinkable
porter
easy
to
enjoy
a
pint
or
two
this
may
be
my
favorite
yazoo
brew
to
date
im
not
good
enough
yet
to
pick
out
the
ryes
role
but
i
like
it
more
than
others
with
rye
that
ive
tried
nicely
drinkable
could
easily
make
a
night
of
this
one
some
black
bread
and
a
healthy
serving
of
schnitzel
and
potatoes
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
producted
by
yazoo
very
good
brew
solid
body
to
pair
with
the
solid
brew
looking
forward
to
more
yazoo
brews
in
the
area
this
one
toes
the
line
between
porter
and
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
great
i
have
to
be
honest
that
i
didnt
go
in
to
this
one
with
much
expectation
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
but
i
really
did
enjoy
it
had
this
on
draft
at
findleys
in
opryland
color
was
slightly
less
dark
than
guinness
with
a
tan
head
the
rye
was
indeed
sly
the
beer
wasnt
as
astringent
as
i
had
anticipated
while
not
as
bitter
as
i
would
expect
from
a
porter
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
purchase
it
if
i
found
it
in
my
part
of
the
country
a
deep
redgarnet
color
with
a
light
tan
head
a
little
sweeter
than
expected
for
a
porter
and
a
little
more
medium
bodied
than
anticipated
this
is
one
of
their
best
trying
my
best
to
support
the
local
brewery
even
though
for
a
while
i
could
only
find
it
at
their
tasting
room
md
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
somewhat
dry
yet
still
creamy
feel
carbonation
just
high
enough
to
provide
life
to
the
feel
very
easy
drinking
found
the
beer
at
flying
saucer
nashville
looking
for
something
with
more
character
but
not
quite
a
stout
the
beer
opens
with
a
heavily
roasted
lightly
chocolate
blend
with
some
brown
ale
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
cereal
grains
the
beer
tastes
more
like
a
stout
with
high
chocolate
notes
than
it
does
a
porter
a
robust
rye
character
takes
charge
as
the
sweetness
subsides
leaving
a
pumpernickle
spice
bread
pungent
character
behind
the
body
is
certainly
on
the
porter
side
showing
a
deleicate
smooth
velvety
texture
aside
from
the
roasted
grain
textures
finishes
with
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
coffee
and
rye
all
in
all
the
rye
character
was
light
and
at
times
hardly
noticable
d
this
went
down
very
easily
but
overall
wasnt
as
good
as
i
hoped
its
obviously
better
than
most
macros
but
not
my
choice
in
craft
beers
i
much
prefer
yazoos
stout
drinkability
lacks
body
needs
more
malt
i
was
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
as
i
was
intrigued
by
the
rye
having
enjoyed
other
rye
beers
particularly
the
terrapin
rye
pale
ale
but
was
disappointed
by
the
beers
flaws
ill
quite
possibly
try
it
again
at
a
different
location
if
possible
for
fairness
sake
had
this
one
on
tap
in
nashville
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
lots
of
light
around
the
edges
and
a
nice
head
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
some
presence
of
rye
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
very
odd
but
good
rye
is
evident
as
well
as
a
good
malt
character
with
some
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffee
has
an
odd
flavor
but
very
enjoyable
for
occassional
beer
drinkers
this
is
a
fine
beer
o
easy
to
drink
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
complexity
of
flavors
and
low
alcohol
which
makes
it
sessionable
recommended
music
pairing
the
kinks
powerman
overall
a
shining
example
of
an
english
porter
such
a
great
beer
and
is
really
a
true
example
of
the
style
great
representation
and
a
beer
that
i
will
revisit
many
times
over
this
is
not
the
beer
to
sip
its
a
true
english
porter
drink
1
2
and
3
wait
a
bit
then
repeat
process
rjt
notes
lighter
in
color
than
any
other
porter
i
have
had
no
smoke
flavor
maybe
there
are
no
roasted
malts
here
only
toasted
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
tasting
beer
lacking
in
complexity
i
may
have
to
go
back
and
reassess
my
perceptions
of
this
beer
and
the
style
my
3
favorite
examples
fullers
sam
smiths
old
engine
oil
are
all
noticeably
darker
in
color
and
flavor
this
beer
reminds
me
most
of
an
americanstyle
brewpub
brown
ale
o
a
beer
id
go
for
based
on
how
drinkable
it
is
good
session
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
14
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
malt
carameltoffee
dark
fruit
and
some
port
wine
aromas
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
some
dark
fruit
and
port
wine
flavors
there
is
a
mild
tartness
in
the
flavor
as
well
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
average
beer
all
around
and
honestly
a
bit
disappointing
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
good
stuff
i
would
have
this
again
much
thanks
to
friends
for
introducing
this
on
to
me
o
a
fantastic
porter
i
often
find
myself
not
really
caring
for
dark
stouts
and
porters
because
theyre
so
overrun
with
bitter
chocolate
overtones
but
this
really
strikes
a
nice
balance
and
becomes
actually
very
drinkable
even
long
into
the
night
awesome
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
its
hard
to
justify
at
412
99
being
that
this
is
the
first
and
only
time
ive
seen
this
beer
its
hard
to
tell
if
its
the
store
or
brewery
not
too
shabby
though
o
solid
english
porter
the
sticky
lacing
and
flavor
were
really
good
i
preferred
this
porter
over
the
st
peters
o
a
noteable
and
worthy
english
porter
this
is
a
very
nice
porter
and
perhaps
a
standardsetter
to
build
from
slainte
i
can
not
tell
if
this
is
as
good
or
better
than
the
1825
recipe
that
i
tried
in
the
past
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
im
not
sure
id
say
it
was
worth
the
price
if
youre
not
on
a
budget
go
for
it
d
this
beer
has
some
subtle
but
unique
qualities
underneath
a
mellow
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
nice
light
cherry
tartness
that
compliments
the
flinty
hint
in
the
nose
ogood
porter
a
beer
with
highs
and
lows
but
very
solid
overall
pours
dark
with
fast
disapearing
white
head
malty
and
a
moderate
roasty
aroma
a
bit
above
average
mouthfeel
very
smooth
good
drinkability
the
taste
is
mostly
rich
malts
the
roastiness
in
the
secondary
biased
on
the
sweet
side
good
understated
carbonation
this
english
porter
has
a
touch
of
spice
and
a
little
more
richheavy
than
a
plain
jane
brown
beer
the
best
attribute
of
this
beer
is
its
aroma
i
prefer
a
beer
like
this
on
a
cold
wintery
night
it
will
fill
you
up
so
dont
plan
on
pounding
the
original
flag
porter
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
it
is
quite
sessionable
with
the
low
alcohol
content
ill
but
this
one
again
when
its
time
to
read
a
book
about
19th
century
beer
brewing
which
happens
to
be
every
so
often
dark
mahogany
color
almost
black
with
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
some
lacing
rich
roasty
malt
aroma
bready
with
some
caramel
and
raisin
notes
roasted
malt
flavor
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
hints
of
raisin
and
licorice
good
depth
of
flavor
and
complexity
subtle
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
d
oh
yeah
getting
this
one
again
with
that
silky
mouthfeel
i
would
gladly
accept
many
waves
of
this
rubyblack
ambrosia
cliche
but
it
is
1825
and
all
poured
a
really
dark
black
with
ruby
hues
around
the
edges
small
tan
head
quickly
dissipated
and
left
no
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
nice
roasted
taste
in
the
back
and
some
nutty
flavor
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
and
i
felt
lacking
to
me
i
was
expecting
more
robust
flavor
of
something
but
the
thiness
kind
of
threw
me
off
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
would
not
find
myself
seeking
this
one
out
again
to
my
surprise
the
whole
package
is
considerably
tasty
and
drinkable
one
of
the
sweeter
porters
ive
had
and
with
little
doubt
one
of
the
better
tasting
ones
ive
had
does
not
impress
but
offers
a
few
unique
flavors
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
beer
is
thinner
than
expected
and
mostly
sweet
with
minimal
roast
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
it
is
simple
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
fail
to
see
what
is
special
about
it
the
original
yeah
i
get
it
but
what
else
i
find
myself
wanting
more
of
anything
here
more
body
more
carbonation
more
sweetness
or
more
roast
id
have
it
again
but
i
doubt
id
buy
it
again
unless
on
cask
id
be
interested
then
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
easy
drinking
and
a
very
decent
example
of
the
style
the
warmer
the
brew
gets
the
more
the
aroma
and
flavor
clashes
with
the
difference
between
sour
almost
lactic
notes
and
fresh
chocolate
overall
this
beer
was
ok
this
wasnt
as
pronounced
with
its
flavors
and
seemed
somewhat
muddy
the
bite
from
the
carbonation
was
nice
and
the
body
was
good
however
in
the
end
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
flag
porter
has
a
nice
dark
brown
colour
with
a
very
good
foamy
head
and
lacing
it
has
a
nice
roasty
malt
smell
with
some
chocolate
in
there
the
flavour
is
malty
with
some
coffee
notes
and
a
hint
of
charcoal
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
creamy
and
thick
like
a
milkshake
this
is
a
really
exceptional
beer
it
greatly
exceeded
my
expectations
head
gets
to
near
two
fingers
of
deep
tan
foam
mostly
larger
bubbles
with
a
steady
dissolve
more
stick
to
the
fat
lacing
than
thus
expected
very
dark
brown
liquid
yet
not
quite
black
you
get
a
wide
band
of
orange
at
the
glasss
bottom
the
nose
at
first
makes
you
think
it
will
be
softer
and
sweeter
than
it
finally
ends
up
wiry
length
to
the
rum
raisin
to
coffee
ice
cream

crisp
and
caramel
popcorn
more
concentration
than

to
the

still
touch

with

which
nevertheless
guides
the
whole
from

toast
more
scone
buttered
biscuit
granola
with

anything
there
is

flavors
knit

and
lift
off
the
palate
maddeningly
easy
to
take
sip
after
sip
that
is
if
you
treat
it
is
an
english
porter
and
not
to
be
understood
in
the
american
idiom
d
i
will
drink
this
anywhere
anytime
i
cant
believe
this
was
not
previously
on
my
radar
drinkability
an
infinitely
drinkable
porter
that
seems
to
conform
very
well
to
the
historical
description
of
the
mixed
beer
style
not
sure
if
this
is
available
locally
but
i
would
certainly
revisit
it
d
tasty
low
alcohol
it
would
make
for
a
nice
session
porter
english
porters
have
really
been
impressing
me
as
of
late
and
this
is
another
good
one
smooth
and
decent
but
theres
much
better
porters
id
keep
this
one
cold
too
everything
about
it
seems
to
weaken
as
it
gets
warmer
bottle
grabbed
this
on
a
whim
after
seeing
it
in
the
cooler
pours
a
lighter
brown
color
with
a
nice
slightly
tan
head
the
nose
reminds
me
of
light
roast
coffee
and
almost
chocolate
or
fudge
and
maybe
some
caramel
the
taste
is
subdued
and
easy
smooth
with
any
real
bite
at
all
only
a
slight
bite
of
bitter
in
the
end
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
like
new
glarus
olde
english
porter
so
it
is
kind
of
a
let
down
in
that
respect
but
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
porter
very
different
compared
to
todays
porters
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
nicely
drinkable
with
a
soft
roasted
aftertaste
clear
dark
coffee
brown
with
a
slight
filmy
tan
cap
dark
fruit
coffee
and
faint
notes
of
charred
oak
and
herbal
hops
in
the
nose
raisin
and
molasses
with
mild
roasty
malt
flavors
pretty
spot
on
for
an
english
porter
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
the
beer
doesnt
really
live
up
to
the
cool
story
on
the
bottle
but
is
a
nice
english
session
beer
thin
body
and
low
abv
make
for
a
very
sessionable
beer
would
be
a
great
default
option
at
the
beer
store
if
it
werent
for
the
high
import
price
d
as
with
most
english
beers
ive
tried
it
was
a
very
sessionable
easy
drinker
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
pour
deep
dark
mahogany
with
tan
head
that
disapated
quickly
and
minimal
lacing
malty
aroma
great
taste
with
hints
of
chocolate
very
smooth
and
inviting
beer
really
enjoyed
the
history
behind
this
brew
and
enjoyed
drinking
it
too
d
you
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
the
flavor
is
a
little
mild
but
good
enough
to
keep
you
reaching
for
another
hv
taste
is
great
rich
thick
creamy
chocolate
milk
with
some
mild
fruitiness
and
a
soothing
sweetness
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
bright
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
and
a
small
light
brown
head
milk
chocolate
sweetness
mild
notes
of
coffee
bitterness
and
an
ashy
texture
lightmedium
in
body
malt
forward
but
not
chewy
enough
for
my
taste
in
the
style
a
sharp
but
easy
drinking
porter
either
way
you
are
comfortable
and
that
is
the
biggest
impression
i
took
from
this
beer
it
has
easy
good
solid
aromas
and
a
smooth
palate
with
no
rough
edges
easily
a
crowd
pleaser
pours
a
near
black
color
with
some
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
small
yet
dense
khaki
colored
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
i
pick
up
some
light
caramel
and
buttery
notes
the
taste
has
a
very
mellow
roast
flavor
with
a
hint
of
honey
or
caramel
sweetness
a
touch
of
lemon
in
the
end
nothing
very
exciting
in
the
flavor
department
but
no
odd
flavors
either
the
feel
is
thick
and
chewy
with
soft
carbonation
has
a
silky
feel
a
neutral
porter
in
terms
of
flavor
not
much
going
on
but
it
seems
to
be
well
made
nice
thick
body
no
odd
flavors
mellow
i
had
this
from
a
bottle
it
poured
dark
brown
with
very
light
lacing
the
smell
was
chocolate
and
coffee
slightly
burnt
i
enjoyed
the
taste
but
it
was
a
lot
lighter
than
i
expected
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
one
based
on
the
reviews
id
read
and
was
let
down
that
said
if
id
tried
it
with
no
expectations
i
wouldnt
have
anything
bad
to
say
a
good
beer
and
one
ill
have
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
in
the
rain
for
one
served
45
degress
a
bit
cold
as
the
temp
rose
some
of
the
more
enjoyable
characteristics
came
on
stronger
the
nose
was
the
best
part
of
the
beer
worth
a
try
md
crisp
mouth
light
to
medium
bodied
drinkable
but
better
porters
available
good
drink
not
exceptional
for
the
style
but
its
pleasant
and
a
few
wont
do
no
harm
overall
i
had
no
problem
drinking
this
one
but
it
is
a
midrange
porter
at
best
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
killing
yourself
to
find
or
selling
the
kids
to
get
in
a
trade
conclusion
damn
good
example
of
an
english
porter
and
the
historicity
of
it
is
cool
as
well
i
wish
i
could
find
this
a
lot
more
readily
this
goes
down
with
black
cat
mild
and
st
peters
oldstyle
porter
as
some
of
my
absoltue
favorite
quaffable
dark
brews
give
me
this
beer
over
an
irish
dry
stout
any
day
poured
a
dark
brown
with
an
moderate
head
with
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
bare
collar
the
aroma
was
vinegar
like
a
wine
that
had
turned
with
a
slight
malty
sweetness
in
the
background
the
taste
was
not
sour
at
all
but
the
chococoffee
was
pretty
mild
feel
was
light
bodied
and
oily
with
little
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
was
a
nice
safe
porter
unwilling
to
offend
anyone
but
reluctant
to
impress
anyone
either
drinkability
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
really
its
flavor
is
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
which
impacts
its
drinkability
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
sessionable
porter
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
12oz

very
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy

beige
head
that
recedes

leave

with
the
typical

yeast
signature

dry
finish
mediumfull
body
decent
porter
very
drinkable
i
really
liked
this
and
it
grew
on
me
only
a
5er
so
this
could
be
a
great
session
brew
if
it
had
a
little
more
umph
of
coffee
and
a
smidgin
more
of
suds
d
easily
sessionable
if
this
is
your
style
of
choice
i
can
see
friends
downing
several
pints
with
fish
chips
i
just
prefer
something
a
little
more
strongly
flavored
as
is
i
get
the
impression
its
trying
to
mate
the
floral
smell
and
fizzy
feel
of
a
pilsner
to
a
darker
beer
and
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
a
decent
porter
no
doubt
d
the
promising
nose
didnt
hold
the
rest
of
the
experience
together
a
bit
too
much
of
a
light
stout
for
my
tastes
the
acidity
detracted
from
the
experience
md
very
smooth
and
creamy
a
very
nice
porter
that
i
would
definitely
go
back
for
again
dark
brown
with
tan
one
finger
head
and
some
lacings
aroma
is
molasses
taste
is
brown
sugar
and
bitter
hops
some
cocoa
malt
mouthfeel
is
full
with
good
carbonation
some
leather
and
molasses
in
the
finish
sessionable
and
quite
good
nice
smooth
bitter
finish
i
picked
up
a
single
bottle
from
my
local
coop
but
i
will
go
back
and
get
a
sixpack
in
the
future
a
very
solid
drinkable
and
enjoyable
porter
this
pours
a
rich
dark
mahogany
with
hints
of
red
around
the
edges
the
caramel
colored
head
dissapears
quickly
a
malty
biscutty
aroma
gives
way
to
alcohol
bite
though
it
is
not
reflected
in
the
flavor
it
starts
with
a
strong
malt
character
then
moves
to
subtle
hop
bite
finishing
with
soft
chocolate
notes
always
seems
a
little
flat
on
the
tongue
but
a
nice
easy
drinker
my
last
bottle
and
ill
be
sorry
to
see
it
go
very
nice
compelling
porter
definitely
not
too
strong
but
tastes
stronger
than
it
is
flavor
is
so
mesmerizing
that
i
could
plow
through
a
bunch
of
these
i
am
truly
impressed
and
surprised
ive
had
some
good
english
beers
but
usually
i
am
not
so
smitten
by
them
as
i
am
by
this
one
this
is
a
nice
smooth
creamy
porter
that
pours
a
pretty
inky
dark
color
with
a
decent
tannish
head
that
retains
and
laces
just
a
bit
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
caramel
some
chocolate
notes
and
some
coffee
hints
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
caramel
chocolatey
there
is
a
roasted
texture
to
the
beer
and
there
is
also
some
charred
flavors
near
the
finish
overall
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
has
a
slightly
tart
caramel
and
butterscotch
flavor
this
is
a
decent
porter
there
is
enough
hop
presence
to
give
the
beer
a
bit
of
a
bittering
balance
but
not
so
much
as
to
take
away
from
the
sweetish
caramel
flavors
in
the
backbone
of
the
beer
a
good
beer
worth
seeking
out
poured
a
blackishbrown
body
with
a
twofinger
head
that
receeded
quickly
and
left
some
lace
patches
a
mild
sweet
malt
smell
mixed
with
some
coffee
or
dry
malt
a
really
smooth
and
creamy
porter
with
roasted
and
possibly
coffee
malts
mixing
with
dark
maybe
unsweetened
chocolate
and
possibly
other
sweet
malts
caramel
there
is
a
very
minor
hop
presence
that
perks
the
beer
up
so
it
isnt
a
syrupy
mess
and
it
does
go
down
with
only
a
mild
drying
sensation
and
rather
smooth
a
rather
mild
porter
but
one
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
is
light
but
flavourful
with
toast
chocolate
leaves
and
light
toastyearthiness
its
very
clean
it
lacks
the
lightly
sour
stewed
fruit
or
tart
quality
that
many
porters
and
the
like
have
or
a
licoriceherbalpepper
quality
others
have
it
is
light

somewhat
silky

overall
i
recommend
this
lighter
bodied
porter
as
a
good
example
of
an
english
porter
drinkability
really
the
defining
quality
of
this
beer
almost
perfect
so
easy
to
finish
a
bottle
and
then
miss
the
taste
10
minutes
later
well
at
the
price
this
cost
for
a
four
pack
i
would
never
buy
it
but
i
just
bought
a
single
and
it
was
worth
a
try
the
smell
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
anchor
porter
so
i
got
pretty
excited
but
the
flavor
isnt
quite
up
to
par
however
it
is
kind
of
cool
to
be
drinking
a
beer
made
with
some
yeast
harvested
off
an
1825
shipwreck
slainte
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
im
not
huge
on
porters
but
this
one
is
a
decent
brew
bottle
from
city
wide
in
south
bend
pours
dark
brown
and
clearish
a
little
ring
of
an
off
white
head
sweet
chocolate
malty
odor
smooth
slightly
sweet
chocolate
with
vague
fruity
truffle
flavor
some
alcohol
smooth
kind
of
thin
mouthfeel
but
wellbalanced
close
to
a
blatic
porter
very
smooth
with
a
fruity
tinge
d
very
easy
to
drink
could
easily
spend
an
afternoon
with
a
few
of
these
body
is
medium
lightly
carbionated
very
creamy
and
slick
overall
very
mild
tastey
and
approachable
kind
of
a
chalky
dryness
accompanies
a
thin
mouthfeel
making
for
a
very
quaffable
beverage
it
drinks
like
water
need
i
say
more
smells
of
sweet
belgian
chocolate
at
first
unfortunately
cardboard
creeps
out
as
it
warms
and
knocks
this
down
a
notch
otherwise
its
highly
drinkable
it
appears
brown
with
an
offtan
head
the
flavor
has
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
with
the
belgian
chocolate
and
chocolate
grains
a
tasty
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
it
fresh
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
but
there
isnt
much
going
on
here
as
i
won
this
on
a
football
wage
im
not
out
anything
but
i
would
not
pick
this
beer
up
on
my
own
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
black
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
so
fast
i
could
not
tell
what
color
it
was
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
the
taste
was
old
flat
and
not
good
as
in
old
what
a
shame
very
out
of
date
tasting
yet
my
importer
just
got
this
one
in
so
i
guess
this
is
what
the
beer
is
like
i
will
not
buy
again
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
profile
carbonation
is
okay
but
not
great
its
decently
smooth
but
its
bland
taste
limits
drinkability
overall
its
okay
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
drinkability
i
paid
3
for
the
bottle
but
im
not
sure
if
id
do
it
again
because
it
goes
down
so
damn
easily
id
be
getting
6packs
if
it
were
cheaper
an
interesting
and
extremely
drinkable
rendition
of
the
style
for
sure
drinkability
pretty
good
easy
drinking
beer
would
buy
again
promising
in
aroma
but
reserved
in
flavor
and
thin
in
texture
makes
for
a
disappointment
not
an
english
porter
that
ill
return
to
nicely
carbonated
and
smooth
one
could
order
a
few
of
these
without
blinking
an
eye
truly
excellent
and
with
a
better
nose
would
be
ranked
even
higher
d
a
masterpiece
for
my
taste
a
top
notch
porter
world
class
sessionable
and
supremely
drinkable
pours
very
dark
brown
that
you
can
barely
see
through
even
though
it
is
clear
minimal
tan
head
in
my
snifter
nose
is
very
nice
thick
chocolate
not
cocoa
powder
or
beans
but
more
like
a
chocolate
bar
flavor
is
as
you
would
expect
from
the
nose
nice
thick
malty
tones
pronounced
bitter
tone
stays
firm
for
staying
power
this
one
keeps
a
good
score
feel
is
thin
though
on
the
liquid
side
a
lot
less
than
you
would
think
but
the
carbonation
is
good
this
is
a
very
good
english
porter
definitely
worth
trying
though
i
would
absolutely
love
to
try
an
extremely
fresh
sample
of
this
d
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
regular
basis
very
nicely
done
there
are
just
a
few
odd
aromas
and
tastes
that
keep
this
from
hitting
higher
perhaps
i
just
have
to
get
used
to
them
and
try
another
give
it
a
shot
this
beer
pours
a
midnight
black
color
with
a
slight
amber
hue
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
there
is
zero
head
when
pouring
only
slight
foam
that
sits
on
top
of
the
beer
from
the
bottle
the
smell
is
big
and
delicious
with
many
roasty
flavors
reminiscent
of
other
porters
the
taste
is
pretty
unimpressive
for
the
first
half
of
the
mouth
but
as
it
sits
on
the
tongue
it
develops
with
a
thick
chocolaty
consistency
with
a
sweet
malt
kick
successive
sips
are
still
impressed
by
the
size
of
this
beer
and
it
seems
there
are
new
flavors
each
time
well
worth
seeking
out
pours
very
smooth
dark
brown
light
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
spotty
lacing
slight
sweet
malty
warm
smell
the
robust
taste
i
am
accustomed
to
with
porters
was
not
present
here
it
is
a
bit
lighter
and
lacks
the
full
bodied
flavor
i
expected
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
low
carbonation
low
alcohol
lever
the
taste
that
you
are
left
with
is
a
warm
nutty
malt
taste
d
easy
drinker
for
sureim
sure
very
quaffable
even
with
the
dark
complexity
not
that
complex
of
a
beer
which
does
diminish
the
desirability
factor
for
me
a
very
nice
evenly
balanced
porter
very
dark
borwn
in
color
almost
completely
opaque
minimal
head
nice
dark
cocoa
coffee
complex

taste
even
better
cocoa
coffee
char
toast
toffee
cant
describe
all
the
complexity
low
carbonation
a
good
thing
very
nice
allaround
porter
not
too
dry
but
with
enough
hop
to
let
you
know
its
there
kitchy
description
on
bottle
but
wellworth
the
try
one
of
the
better
porters
ive
had
overall
a
very
pleasant
smooth
drinkable
beer
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
this
has
the
characteristics
of
a
classic
english
porter
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
style
very
well
nice
example
of
the
style
heard
about
this
one
from
a
friend
and
knew
i
had
to
taste
it
what
can
i
say
im
a
sucker
for
cool
stories
and
neat
packaging
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
one
had
just
a
little
head
which
slowly
vanished
the
beer
is
thick
and
dark
it
looks
quite
a
bit
like
espresso
in
the
glass
with
bits
of
the
legendary
salvaged
yeast
floating
throughout
smell
is
very
smooth
coffee
and
cocoa
i
cant
wait
to
taste
it
taste
follows
smell
amazingly
well
still
coffee
and
cocoa
just
more
prominent
and
rich
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
and
silky
without
being
oily
at
all
drinkability
is
very
good
only
suffering
the
slightest
bit
from
the
richness
this
may
become
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
yet
drinkability
is
medium
range
this
one
is
moderately
drinkable
but
houses
flavors
that
do
not
agree
with
all
palates
still
this
one
is
a
great
example
of
an
english
porter
note
i
am
reviewing
this
again
under
elgoods
flag
porter
1825
original
httpbeeradvocate
combeerprofile30497282
because
even
though
my
bottle
says
darwin
brewery
this
beer
based
on
description
and
the
picture
is
exactly
the
same
what
is
the
difference
between
these
two
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
the
perfect
balance
between
body
flavor
texture
and
etc
for
a
porter
that
is
theres
a
nice
roasty
malty
chocolatey
ever
so
slightly
hoppiness
a
chuggability
too
color
is
strangely
either
a
hazy
brown
with
some
reddish
overtones
or
a
dark
cherry
brown
with
brown
overtones
ok
just
shoot
me
whatever
want
to
try
this
beer
warmer
overall
plenty
of
contrasting
flavors
mixing
together
without
fighting
in
the
mouth
light
carbonation
medium
body
an
allaround
great
beer
overall
a
decent
though
hardly
exemplary
porter
im
not
sure
that
yeast
from
an
1825
shipwreck
really
makes
a
difference
worth
a
try
overall
darwins
original
flag
is
still
a
decent
beer
that
would
no
doubt
be
much
more
worthy
when
served
off
a
fresh
tap
overall
this
is
a
decent
porter
even
if
the
yeast
strain
is
somewhat
of
a
novelty
its
a
solid
porter
it
fits
the
style
well
d
a
nice
porter
the
more
porters
i
try
the
more
and
more
i
like
the
style
would
be
nice
on
a
cool
night
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
nice
opagueness
but
still
some
light
through
on
the
sides
and
bottom
nice
short
lived
off
white
head
with
decent
lace
and
audible
carbonation
smell
was
a
decent
english
average
porter
caramel
sugar
and
roasted
malts
were
really
the
most
notable
aromas
the
taste
was
smooth
crisp
a
tad
watery
with
the
caramel
being
mellowed
somewhat
by
a
nice
albeit
small
hoppy
back
overall
this
was
a
nice
light
sessionable
porter
could
really
throw
down
a
few
of
these
and
the
light
caliber
went
well
with
dinner
not
really
a
late
night
sipper
but
not
a
bad
ballgame
beer
drinkability
very
good
porter
well
balanced
i
would
definately
consider
this
to
rank
very
high
on
my
porter
list
d
not
for
the
faint
of
hearts
excellent
example
of
a
porter
i
wouldnt
recommend
as
an
everyday
but
definitely
as
a
treat
of
something
special
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
british
porter
i
like
the
clean
flavor
and
light
mouthfeel
making
it
a
good
session
beer
the
fact
that
the
yeast
survived
since
1825
to
give
birth
to
this
beer
is
pretty
cool
and
makes
it
all
the
better
i
think
i
like
fullers
london
porter
better
because
it
has
more
depth
of
flavor
but
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
i
hope
to
be
able
to
revise
my
review
after
i
drink
my
other
bottle
but
as
it
stands
this
is
undrinkable
and
nowhere
near
worth
the
money
mouthfeel
was
thin
yet
there
was
some
sparkling
carbonation
in
the
mouth
the
history
of
this
one
is
far
more
interesting
than
the
actual
beer
drinkability
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
at
5
im
sure
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
the
taste
just
isnt
anything
spectacular
and
i
was
hoping
for
more
d
this
wound
up
being
a
pretty
good
one
it
doesnt
have
much
bitternesseven
in
the
chocolate
that
it
featuresbut
its
a
smooth
drinkable
porter
d
easy
to
drink
but
id
probably
opt
for
a
better
porter
to
make
a
session
out
of
it
mediumbodied
very
easy
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
but
still
missing
out
some
power
on
that
taste
i
really
cant
feel
all
the
stuff
the
previous
reviewers
mentioned
acceptable
but
there
are
lots
of
better
porters
out
there
truly
a
superior
beer
wow
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
inch
of
head
smells
of
roasted
caramels
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
roasted
caramel
came
through
on
the
palate
with
more
of
a
chocolately
feel
very
balanced
abv
5
with
just
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
smooth
and
dry
made
this
incredibly
drinkable
good
session
beer
four
pack
did
me
well
tonight
served
in
a
pint
glass
original
flag
porter
pours
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
which
goes
away
quickly
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
smoke
chocolate
and
caramel
overall
the
aroma
is
nice
and
sweet
it
tastes
the
same
way
to
me
except
that
theres
a
dark
fruit
taste
in
the
beer
too
not
a
strong
aftertaste
either
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
expected
but
its
very
smooth
and
a
little
slick
drinkability
is
pretty
high
i
could
easily
have
this
as
a
session
beer
i
think
this
is
pretty
good
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
to
try
i
bought
a
4
pack
thinking
i
might
have
one
or
two
i
was
wrong
back
to
the
store
a
nice
session
beer
to
enjoy
with
friends
recommended
drinking
for
porter
drinkers
the
beer
poured
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
bit
of
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
dark
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
was
a
very
delicate
smokieness
that
was
followed
by
a
smooth
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
quite
a
surprise
mainly
because
i
would
never
have
conceived
of
such
a
combination
the
feel
is
smooth
and
dry
this
is
an
exceptionaly
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
wonderful
balance
of
smokieness
and
sweetness
that
delivers
a
beer
that
answers
to
both
desires
this
is
definately
one
that
will
show
back
up
in
my
supply
it
is
however
drinkable
the
beer
doesnt
have
any
negative
attributes
and
has
quite
a
few
positive
ones
it
just
doesnt
all
come
together
although
the
thought
of
harvesting
yeast
off
a
sunken
ship
is
pretty
damn
cool
d
outstanding
this
is
just
above
water
in
terms
of
refreshment
i
finished
this
before
i
finished
my
review
which
is
a
rarity
when
i
do
them
simultaneously
honestly
if
a
local
bar
served
this
i
could
drink
a
pint
of
this
every
day
with
my
dinner
since
porters
dont
rank
high
on
my
list
of
favorite
styles
that
is
quite
a
statement
it
is
really
an
everyday
dort
of
beer
the
price
here
isnt
bad
so
i
imagine
england
is
much
better
off
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
the
greatest
thing
this
one
is
a
dark
nearly
black
beer
with
a
notably
tan
head
when
held
to
the
light
a
deep
amber
color
works
its
way
through
the
liquid
the
aroma
is
fairly
intense
lots
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
not
much
in
the
way
of
very
highly
roasted
black
patent
style
aroma
though
instead
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
decidedly
chocolate
base
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
caramel
and
fruit
plums
come
out
right
away
again
chocolate
is
prominent
in
the
taste
the
finish
is
sweet
as
well
i
thought
that
a
little
more
hops
wouldnt
have
hurt
the
balance
on
this
one
the
body
is
a
little
light
which
made
the
beer
more
drinkable
than
i
first
thought
it
would
have
been
all
in
all
this
one
is
interesting
but
not
the
type
of
porter
that
id
seek
out
the
flavor
is
dark
malts
little
roasted
chocolate
malt
its
a
little
dry
it
could
also
have
a
little
more
body
but
over
all
a
good
porter
just
a
little
expencive
pours
dark
and
certainly
porterlike
but
no
head
lots
of
chocolateon
the
nose
almost
smells
like
a
yoo
hoo

taste
delivers

finish
drinks
clean
but
with
a
slight
smokey
overroasted
burrnt
flavor
to
it
drinks
okay
but
nothing
special
as
porters
go
the
mouth
feels
just
bit
too
thin
for
me
this
is
an
ok
porter
but
i
really
wont
look
for
it
when
the
porter
thirst
strikes
me

maybe
some

too
very
agreeable

a

of

in
the
flavour
as
well
i
still
claim
to
get
some
vanilla
the
yeast
works
in
there
well
lending
this
some
likeability
as
a
whole
though
these
flavours
fall
rather
short
of
anything
great
no
dimension
in
terms
of
roastness
flavour
seems
to
skip
out
on
some
sips
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
just
fine
but
as
far
as
reviewing
it
it
just
seemed
inconsistent
mild
and
passive
came
across
as
being
a
little
too
commercial
for
authentic
traditional
realdeal
english
porter
its
a
tough
one
to
qualify
because
i
do
like
it
but
i
wouldnt
think
of
it
as
a
porter
overall
if
you
have
the
opportunity
i
highly
recommend
this
one
it
would
be
nice
on
a
cold
winter
night
although
not
my
favorite
style
the
beer
was
well
made
and
fit
the
profile
of
a
good
porter
this
beer
might
have
been
a
bit
past
its
prime
notes
not
something
ill
go
out
of
my
way
for
or
for
that
matter
pay
the
high
price
compared
to
brews
made
locally
plenty
of
good
porters
stateside
with
good
prices
damn
fine
beer
just
not
going
to
be
in
my
stable
again
soon
d
yes
it
was
thin
but
i
have
to
say
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
brew
i
wouldnt
session
this
its
too
good
for
that
this
i
would
consider
a
great
kick
back
relax
and
enjoy
beer
flavor
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
waves
of
chocolate
and
coffee
finished
cleaner
than
expected
and
not
taken
over
with
the
bitterness
like
a
bunch
of
the
american
rivals
made
this
one
come
off
as
creamier
and
more
drinkable
overall
a
great
porter
this
could
definitely
be
a
session
beer
its
so
smooth
and
wellbalanced
overall
i
am
starting
to
think
i
might
have
a
bad
bottle
ive
had
one
of
these
about
a
year
ago
but
i
remember
liking
it
it
doenst
taste
bad
so
i
am
still
reviewing
it
and
will
get
another
bottle
of
it
sometime
and
rereview
it
if
i
think
things
have
changed
this
one
was
a
muddy
dark
brown
with
just
a
ring
of
offwhite
bubbles
the
nose
straightup
smells
like
yoohoo
the
taste
is
a
swirl
of
nut
toffee
slight
coffee
and
hints
of
choclate
with
a
backbone
of
muted
earthy
bittering
hops
i
suppose
this
is
a
more
traditional
authentic
approach
to
porter
but
im
not
so
into
it
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
this
a
decent
drinkable
way
overpriced
beer
first
time
drinking
this
beer
im
thoroughly
impressed
good
aromas
of
chocolate
coffee
barley
malts
and
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
fermentation
sourness
adds
to
the
complexity
looks
nearly
black
with
a
slight
tan
foamstand
that
stayed
til
the
end
tastes
full
and
round
with
the
chocolate
coffee
toffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
cream
never
aggressive
not
dominant
in
any
flavor
melded
together
nicely
quite
rich
and
smooth
on
the
toung
easy
drinking
quite
silky
and
bold
i
highly
recommend
smooth
and
clean
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
great
beer
drinkability
this
one
is
all
about
the
chocolate
malt
yet
its
still
wellbalanced
a
really
nice
surprise
from
a
beer
i
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
before
one
nice
porter
hands
down
i
cant
recall
why
this
is
a
beer
in
the
news
but
regardless
this
was
a
crowd
favorite
at
the
discussion
tent
at
the
world
beer
festival
many
asked
for
seconds
and
i
had
to
agree
with
them
darker
than
others
in
this
style
nice
malty
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
hoppiness
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
soon
but
unsure
where
to
find
it
drinkability
all
in
all
despite
its
flaws
a
very
drinkable
porter
medium
bodied
smooth
almost
creamy
after
the
carbonation
drops
away
a
lingering
smoky
maltiness
and
molasses
yummy
thank
you
kind
publican
may
i
have
another
this
makes
a
nice
dessert
beer
i
would
find
it
tough
toi
drink
several
of
this
rich
brews
this
has
always
been
a
favorite
english
porter
of
course
you
need
to
find
it
my
bottle
has
a
weak
quick
dissolving
head
but
holds
a
smell
a
bit
rendolent
of
molasses
a
very
dark
color
and
rich
bodied
beer
this
beer
supposedly
is
brewed
with
yeast
brought
up
from
a
shipwreck
urban
legend
or
not
this
is
a
great
quaff
that
must
be
drank
at
room
temperature
drinkability
if
i
can
find
it
again
ill
probably
snag
a
few
more
i
think
it
was
about
2
75
per
but
worth
it
overall
comments
a
solid
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
history
behind
the
beer
is
more
interesting
than
the
beer
itself
in
my
opinion
medium
bodied
and
smooth
rather
nice
its
brewed
to
an
1800s
recipe
with
a
yeast
recovered
from
an
1825
shipwreck
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
and
creamy
black
and
chocolate
malt
scent
it
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
black
and
earthy
flavor
with
a
sweet
creamy
chocolate
malt
finish
its
thin
but
a
very
flavorful
beer
that
drinks
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
porter
i
love
the
chocolate
characteristics
it
has
a
great
aroma
and
taste
a
good
drinker
ps
after
posting
this
i
only
just
now
read
the
previous
review
by
yoko
we
had
almost
exactly
the
same
experience
of
this
beer
and
wrote
about
it
the
same
way
pleasantly
surprised
that
so
many
of
my
perceptions
of
this
or
any
other
brew
have
a
common
ground
with
others
this
came
highly
recommended
i
can
appreciate
why
it
was
enjoyed
by
another
however
this
is
not
my
preferred
porter
style
good
tasty
porter
smooth
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
id
prefer
a
bit
thicker
feel
on
the
tongue
there
is
something
in
the
taste
maybe
a
lack
of
hops
which
bring
the
sweetness
in
balance
which
hurts
drinkability
a
bit
but
good
overall
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
ill
probably
pick
up
a
couple
more
although
i
normally
prefer
often
big
american
porters
to
often
not
so
big
english
ones
i
wouldnt
change
a
single
thing
about
old
flag
its
a
classic
version
and
is
great
beer
no
matter
what
flag
you
drink
under
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
id
like
a
little
more
flavor
and
bitterness
from
hops
andor
roasted
grain
a
very
solid
porter
nothing
outrageous
but
very
solid
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
a
minimal
light
brown
head
that
reduces
to
just
a
ring
the
aroma
is
chocolatey
and
roasty
with
coffee
notes
the
flavor
is
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
notes
it
is
medium
in
body
and
an
easy
drinker
not
a
bad
porter
overall
pours
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
thru
out
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
heregreat
aroma
of
cocoasmokeand
dark
roasted
coffee
very
rich
and
appetizing
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
aroma
though
somewhat
watery
but
there
some
smokey
flavors
and
some
bitter
chocolate
like
i
said
the
beer
seemed
a
little
to
watery
thinbut
there
are
some
good
characteristics
for
a
quality
brew
going
on
could
i
please
try
this
fresh
from
a
justtapped
cask
i
can
only
imagine
though
this
beer
survives
travel
fairly
well
smoky
with
sweet
malty
character
bursting
on
the
tongue
little
to
no
hops
which
leaves
you
free
to
enjoy
the
malts
which
linger
good
not
great
silky
rather
than
syrupy
on
the
tongue
light
yet
flavorful
this
traditional
porter
is
clear
in
its
influence
on
its
contemporaries
roasted
smoky
flavors
singed
chocolate
and
grilled
fruit
concentrated
and
rehydrated
remarkably
delicate
and
well
balanced
just
easy
good
flavorful
drinking
absolutely
beautiful
gorgeous
velvety
feminine
perfumes
of
baked
blue
fruits
and
caribbean
chocolate
on
the
palate
it
is
rain
water
clear
with
chunky
meaty
suggestions
of
marrow
roasted
seeds
blackberry
paste
bitter
chocolate
smoky
branches
and
creosote
much
lighter
than
modern
porter
convention
would
have
it
there
is
something
profoundly
drinkable
about
this
brew
very
complex
succulent
and
interesting
the
best
porter
ever
taste
combines
a
slightly
dry
malt
flavor
with
an
almost
brownsugar
sweetness
its
not
as
dry
toast
bitter
as
i
expected
but
its
really
a
nice
filling
sensation
however
the
sweetness
accumulates
and
makes
it
necessary
for
some
water
pours
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
small
tan
head
quickly
disappears
but
some
lace
is
left
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
roasted
aroma
with
dark
chocolate
and
rum
flavor
is
dominated
but
raosted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
molasses
are
also
present
hops
are
not
noticable
and
the
bitterness
is
provided
by
roasted
grain
thinner
then
expected
and
smooth
nice
drinkability
nothing
heavy
to
stop
you
from
having
a
few
a
solid
porter
this
is
a
nice
porter
not
as
heavy
as
some
pours
a
limited
head
that
leaves
quickly
even
so
there
is
a
bit
of
lacing
very
dark
amber
chocolate
smell
i
didnt
notise
the
alcohole
the
flavor
is
chocolate
with
the
light
tar
expected
from
english
porters
not
heavy
on
the
tongue
move
like
a
lager
then
a
porter
usually
i
drink
a
porter
for
favor
and
approach
it
like
food
this
porter
is
actually
refreshing
this
is
worth
a
try
it
poured
dark
dark
ruby
black
with
a
small
tan
head
got
a
good
whiff
of
a
woody
and
smokey
odor
my
first
reaction
is
this
brew
is
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
i
expected
its
very
smooth
with
typical
porter
flavor
punctuated
by
an
almost
fruity
aspect
the
finish
is
very
sweet
and
sugary
its
ok
although
i
would
say
it
tastes
like
a
borderline
porter
pours
out
very
dark
and
lovely
nearly
opaque
black
with
faint
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
aroma
is
medicinalalcoholic
roasty
and
fruity
taste
is
very
complex
with
dry
roasted
malt
as
the
primary
profile
with
hints
of
coffee
smoke
raisin
chocolate
black
pepper
and
licorice
lactic
acid
like
sourness
also
adds
to
the
complexity
a
bit
thicker
than
most
other
ordinary
porters
ive
tried
the
complexity
makes
the
drinkability
suffer
a
bit
makes
a
fine
sipping
beer
to
wind
down
the
night
poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
tints
not
too
much
head
just
some
bubbles
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smelled
sweet
with
plenty
of
molassas
and
brown
sugar
taste
was
more
heavily
coffee
flavored
with
tasty
sweetness
and
a
doughy
finish
thin

without
much
carbonation
all
in
all
a
tasty
beer
brewery
website
has
an
interesting
story
about
the
recovery
analysis
and
development
of
this
porters
recipe
and
the
1825
shipwrecked
barge
from
which
they
got
the
yeast
strain
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tinge
head
was
small
tan
and
didnt
hang
around
for
a
while
lacing
was
moderate
with
a
nice
collar
of
foam
visible
throughout
this
beers
time
in
my
glass
smell
was
of
roasted
malt
similar
to
dark
chocolate
with
subtle
cherry
notes
taste
was
of
dark
rich
velvety
chocolate
with
fruity
notes
hovering
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasingly
thick
this
beer
has
a
filling
sticktoyerribs
effect
and
would
be
great
paired
up
with
a
nice
dessert
this
same
richness
works
against
it
in
drinkability
as
its
a
little
to
heavy
for
repeated
pints
all
in
all
a
nice
porter
this
is
a
great
unique
local
brew
malty
with
hints
of
whiskey
refreshing
this
time
of
year
oa
nonimperial
barrel
aged
beer
that
maintains
enough
whiskey
flavor
to
keep
my
interest
it
has
its
flaws
but
its
a
tasty
beer
overall
about
as
close
to
a
session
barrelaged
dark
beer
as
you
can
get
really
impressive
how
they
can
cram
in
a
ton
of
flavor
to
a
lower
abv
porter
of
course
its
not
as
thick
or
bourbon
forward
as
a
lot
of
big
ba
stouts
and
porters
but
thats
not
what
its
trying
to
be
at
all
for
what
its
trying
to
be
its
damn
near
perfect
o
i
feel
like
they
did
a
very
good
job
crafting
this
as
a
low
abv
barrelaged
beer
it
is
often
the
case
that
i
would
like
a
barrelaged
beer
but
im
reluctant
due
to
the
high
amount
of
alcohol
i
could
see
this
filling
in
nicely
especially
if
they
put
it
in
12
oz
bottles
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
troy
ny
pours
dark
brown
with
long
lived
offwhite
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
coffee
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
and
whisky
body
is
medium
and
smooth
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
whisky
and
hint
of
hops
combine
on
the
palate
finish
is
long
and
semidry
interesting
tasty
porter
overall
a
badly
crafted
beer
that
suffers
the
most
at
the
hands
of
the
mouthfeel
and
minimal
time
given
in
the
barrel
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
prefer
on
draft
interesting
for
a
5
75
percent
abv
porterbut
not
for
a
whiskeybarrel
beer
its
nice
to
have
a
barrelaged
beer
thats
not
of
a
hefty
abv
though
ofirst
review
of
a
cask
beer
it
did
have
the
notes
of
being
on
cask
but
it
seemed
to
add
an
oak
flavoring
to
the
beer
above
all
else
cheers
o
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
for
never
hearing
of
the
brewery
i
was
skeptical
of
a
barrel
aged
beer
with
such
a
low
abv
but
this
was
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
o
i
have
lived
in
troy
for
4
years
and
havent
had
this
beer
until
today
i
have
wasted
4
years
the
body
is
medium
and
the
highly
alcoholic
aspect
manages
to
stop
short
of
astringency
which
can
be
a
problem
with
aging
a
beer
in
a
barrel
of
something
like
whiskey
its
just
crisp
enough
and
flows
just
smoothly
enough
to
make
for
easy
sipping
got
this
as
an
extra
from
a
trading
partner
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
pours
a
95
opaque
black
two
finger
head
thanks
to
a
sdtm
pour
the
bourbons
faintly
noticeable
but
theres
a
decent
amount
of
coffee
in
the
nose
the
taste
isnt
domintated
by
the
bourbon
but
its
there
and
its
a
nice
addition
theres
a
lot
of
coffee
vanilla
and
toasted
malt
in
the
flavor
really
a
good
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
astringent
side
but
its
not
overbearing
finishes
off
smooth
leaving
the
bourbon
behind
very
decent
beer
would
have
again
d
surprisingly
solid
beer
itd
be
hard
to
drink
a
bomber
of
this
on
your
own
even
though
its
fairly
low
in
abv
still
it
was
plenty
enjoyable
for
812oz
light
whiskey
notes
over
modestly
roasted
malts
with
a
lingering
sweetness
that
never
gets
overpowering
really
tasty
light
bodied
this
goes
down
much
easier
than
many
other
whiskey
barrel
aged
beers
i
guess
this
treatment
works
very
well
for
a
porter
picked
up
a
growler
while
visiting
family
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
by
far
poured
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
an
extremely
dark
brown
coloring
almost
black
in
the
deepest
points
the
brew
starts
with
a
thick
chunky
airy
head
that
starts
around
three
inches
and
quickly
settles
into
a
thin
film
good
level
of
bubbles
throughout
the
brew
and
there
is
a
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
extremely
robust
and
round
with
a
strong
mocha
chocolate
backbone
a
hint
of
coffee
bitter
and
a
good
overtone
of
rich
vanilla
from
the
barrel
aging
flavor
is
coffee
initially
with
a
rich
creamy
vanilla
and
whiskey
hue
and
a
touch
of
bittersweet
chocolate
body
stays
rich
and
creamy
throughout
with
a
great
feel
for
the
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
and
the
finish
is
creamy
and
slick
tremendous
brew
this
beer
changes
tastes
depending
upon
the
brand
of
whiskey
barrel
pieces
used
imo
opinion
the
first
year
was
the
best
still
this
is
one
big
wild
and
uneven
beer
kudos
for
your
successful
experimention
one
of
browns
best
o
a
pleasant
beer
has
nice
characteristics
from
the
whiskey
but
still
maintains
the
boldness
of
a
porter
well
crafted
overall
this
might
be
the
closest
thing
to
a
barrel
aged
session
beer
ive
ever
encountered
the
short
time
spent
in
barrels
here
added
just
a
little
extra
dimension
to
a
pretty
good
tasting
base
beer
this
isnt
even
in
the
same
neighborhood
as
the
more
gigantic
barrel
bombs
im
familiar
with
a
nice
diversion
especially
if
browns
wanted
to
bulk
up
the
body
just
a
bit
cheers
drinkability
wellbalanced
complex
and
quaffable
for
those
that
love
barrel
aged
beers
but
get
tired
of
the
high
abvs
this
may
be
the
beer
for
you
browns
gets
it
done
yet
again
a
must
try
for
porter
fans
get
a
bottle
if
you
can
i
will
buy
another
bottle
next
time
i
am
in
the
store
even
though
i
am
trying
to
stay
away
from
bombers
this
one
is
easy
on
the
wallet
and
very
drinkable
notes
a
very
drinkable
baed
porter
it
succeeds
at
both
being
a
decent
porter
and
at
integrating
the
barrel
flavors
without
whitewashing
the
beer
not
an
extreme
barrelaged
brew
but
a
nice
one
for
sure
d
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
perfect
match
for
a
sweet
honey
bbqd
glazed
venison
tenderloin
or
maplepecan
glazed
turkey
breast
steve
the
beer
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
the
bourbon
notes
are
strong
causing
anticipation
of
some
heat
but
it
isnt
there
nice
smooth
brew
that
any
true
malty
will
love
dm
drinks
smoothly
but
slightly
heavy
warms
the
pallet
very
slight
carbonation
tingle
overall
loved
the
brew
d
very
drinkable
beer
has
a
nice
balance
of
feeling
light
but
still
having
a
lot
of
flavor
and
not
feeling
empty
at
all
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
and
overall
the
beer
is
very
smooth
drinkability
a
sipper
the
oak
is
done
well
it
is
not
too
overpowering
as
to
lose
the
porter
taste
this
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
one
or
two
per
sitting
but
a
very
good
job
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
almost
black
colored
brown
with
a
small
yet
ample
off
white
head
really
had
a
nice
porter
look
to
it
there
is
also
a
big
whiskey
barrel
aroma
some
scotch
like
vanilla
characters
in
it
that
make
this
really
inviting
for
the
winter
and
colder
months
big
maple
roasted
malts
also
the
flavor
is
a
little
off
and
tastes
a
bit
of
infection
because
of
a
sour
cherry
component
it
gets
really
nice
on
the
palate
as
its
light
bodied
but
off
balanced
and
disjointed
on
the
flavors
i
get
a
little
bit
of
whiskey
and
porter
like
qualities
but
the
cherry
flavor
puts
this
off
tangy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
nice
as
this
is
perfectly
low
carbonated
as
should
be
a
porter
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
especially
in
troy
at
the
brew
pub
fresh
and
on
draft
nice
beer
but
not
doing
it
like
i
thought
it
would
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
but
it
was
a
decent
beer
a
little
light
in
body
and
whiskey
for
a
barrel
aged
porter
worth
a
try
though
and
not
terribly
expensive
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
nice
whiskey
notes
chocolatetoffee
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
nice
touch
of
whiskey
some
chocolatetoffee
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
my
first
brew
from
browns
and
its
pretty
tasty
dont
see
too
many
whiskey
porters
in
the
under
6
abv
range
glad
to
have
gotten
a
chance
to
try
it
i
had
to
try
this
because
i
heard
it
won
some
award
at
tap
ny
this
year
maybe
ill
try
it
again
some
day
perhaps
i
just
had
a
young
bottle
biggest
surprise
of
the
season
for
me
this
local
beer
is
incredible
d
well
though
certainly
not
bad
the
taste
and
drinkability
are
hurt
by
the
sour
notes
that
i
am
getting
would
love
to
try
this
one
the
way
it
was
intended
mouthfeel
is
fine
dries
up
nicely
but
the
medicinal
flavor
does
not
leave
me
wanting
more
ive
heard
good
things
about
this
brew
and
like
their
others
so
i
suspect
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
off
tap
at
the
brewery
this
beer
was
a
nearly
opaque
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
tan
head
the
retention
was
good
especially
as
a
collar
and
the
lacing
scattered
the
aroma
was
surprisingly
subtle
roasted
malt
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
whiskey
barrel
wood
the
flavors
were
damn
tasty
full
or
roasted
malt
chocolate
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
toffee
whiskey
wood
and
hints
of
vanilla
the
sweeter
notes
lead
me
to
believe
the
whiskey
used
was
bourbon
and
the
bite
of
the
bourbon
really
came
through
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
perfect
d
very
good
the
bourbon
or
whiskey
appearance
would
normally
indicate
that
this
would
be
a
sipper
rather
than
one
to
drink
straight
up
but
the
flavor
from
any
barrel
aging
was
so
subtle
and
smooth
that
this
was
easy
to
take
down
a
very
nice
beer
that
was
enjoyable
and
which
i
recommend
trying
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
with
solid
carbonation
that
makes
this
what
i
would
call
a
session
barrel
aged
porter
quite
tasty
and
i
would
imbibe
in
this
more
often
if
i
was
able
to
purchase
it
locally
thanks
to
dmeadows
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
tasty
brew
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
tan
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
mahogany
brew
what
head
there
is
lasts
nicely
with
slowfalling
lace
aroma
is
sweet
and
boozy
taste
is
a
quick
whiskey
character
to
start
along
with
ample
dark
sweetness
dark
fruitiness
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
a
lightly
boozy
tartness
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
with
the
tart
prickles
and
drinkability
is
good
very
interesting
brew
id
like
it
better
without
the
tart
but
there
it
is
d
we
split
the
bomber
and
one
could
easiely
drink
this
by
themselves
massive
taste
with
a
very
reasonable
abv
well
done
browns
this
beer
is
delicious
i
cant
wait
for
more
thanks
to
my
sister
for
bring
some
home
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
brought
it
back
from
a
trip
to
browns
in
the
bottle
amazing
it
has
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
beautiful
caramel
colored
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
the
hint
of
whisky
over
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
nutty
aroma
the
taste
is
exceptional
it
is
a
complex
flavor
with
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
whisky
and
nuts
the
aftertaste
is
excellent
very
dark
roasted
flavor
with
a
clean
sweet
finish
very
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
this
may
be
browns
best
beer
they
make
on
nitro
tap
at
the
man
of
kent
in
hoosick
fallsnypoured
a
deep
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
creamy
one
finger
slight
off
white
head
atop
aromas
were
pretty
light
just
light
vanilla
and
roasted
notesthe
oak
flavors
come
out
more
in
the
flavors
somewhat
woody
and
highly
roasted
the
vanilla
tones
are
tame
wich
i
like
its
not
like
so
many
wood
aged
beers
that
are
just
overpowered
with
woody
flavors
creamy
easy
going
down
mouthfeel
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
lunchi
was
hoping
to
have
on
cask
but
nitro
was
fine
incredible
smoothness
and
delicious
flavor
just
begs
for
more
nice
subtle
complexities
easy
to
drink
and
is
versatile
enough
to
accompany
a
burger
have
with
desert
or
just
enjoy
on
its
own
unfortunately
i
had
to
dump
most
of
the
bottle
because
its
a
big
glass
of
butter
probably
much
better
right
from
the
brewery
cheers
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
an
english
porter
that
is
aged
in
jack
daniels
barrels
it
pours
nice
and
dark
with
no
head
the
aroma
has
some
light
roasted
malt
but
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
as
well
the
flavor
is
great
and
is
similar
to
the
aroma
there
is
a
good
roasty
flavor
with
a
good
smooth
sweetness
from
the
whiskey
it
is
on
the
upper
end
of
medium
bodied
from
the
sweetness
and
has
great
drinkability
this
is
probably
the
best
english
porter
ive
ever
had
but
its
probably
not
very
traditional
it
tastes
awesome
and
thats
what
it
counts
o
this
beer
is
extremely
flavorful
rivaling
that
of
a
russian
imperial
stout
except
there
is
no
bitterness
and
is
obviously
lighter
in
body
my
lovehate
relationship
with
shorts
brewing
is
being
won
over
today
by
my
second
excellent
offering
from
their
brewery
this
porter
pours
a
deep
almost
black
mahogany
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
substantial
tan
lacing
the
aroma
is
overwhelmed
by
rich
chocolate
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
creamy
fairly
heavy
for
a
porter
but
strictly
in
the
best
of
ways
the
flavor
adds
a
significant
amount
of
coffee
and
roast
to
the
notes
found
in
the
nose
their
is
surprisingly
little
alcohol
bite
given
the
abv
it
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
shorts
is
still
the
quintessential
hit
or
miss
brewery
for
me
but
this
is
definitely
a
hit
overall
excellent
example
of
a
porter
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
it
rivals
edmund
fitzgerald
and
black
butte
and
is
somewhere
in
between
those
and
everett
porter
which
still
reigns
supreme
in
the
porter
category
anyway
this
is
probably
the
one
shorts
beer
that
im
most
impressed
with
so
far
o
very
impressed
by
this
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
by
shorts
overall
this
porter
is
interesting
and
intriguing
you
cant
miss
the
sweet
malt
backbone
yet
its
the
bitterness
and
husk
astringency
that
probably
will
strike
most
drinkers
theres
a
subtle
alcohol
warmth
throughout
that
gives
an
added
dimension
to
things
poured
from
a
bottle
a
jet
black
color
with
a
light
offwhite
head
has
a
chocolate
and
malty
aroma
taste
is
sweet
dark
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
also
get
some
malts
and
coffee
has
a
medium
to
full
body
feel
and
goes
down
smooth
a
very
tasty
porter
o
im
impressed
with
this
one
a
well
put
together
porter
with
style
a
smooth
sweet
and
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
flawlessly
balancing
a
bitter
hop
backbone
rich
chocolate
warming
the
way
to
the
gullet
this
is
one
fine
example
of
a
porter
i
acquired
this
bottle
in
a
pick
yer
six
at
a
local
well
stocked
beer
store
for
my
first
try
and
im
very
pleased
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
a
sixer
of
these
in
the
future
overall
good
beer
was
not
expecting
such
a
smoky
character
like
was
experienced
but
in
a
good
way
this
beer
does
not
drink
like
a
9
beer
for
me
it
is
smooth
smoky
alcohol
is
not
overwhelming
i
honestly
feel
like
this
is
shorts
best
beer
and
i
doubt
they
could
top
this
one
brilliant
brew
reviewed
1509
o
interesting
a
bit
too
roasty
and
bitter
to
enjoy
a
lot
of
but
pleasant
in
small
quantities
highly
recommended
a
great
brew
thanks
abanton
for
sharing
yet
another
great
brew
o
a
really
tasty
beer
great
mix
of
chocolate
and
fruit
onice
porter
with
good
labor
and
balance
really
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
porter
very
glad
to
try
it
and
will
buy
again
in
the
future
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
this
but
it
turned
out
to
be
pretty
good
i
like
things
that
are
superroasted
and
thats
exactly
what
this
is
a
little
heavy
on
the
alcohol
character
though
this
one
is
definitely
a
slower
sipper
than
i
pictured
it
would
be
it
was
a
nice
dark
brown
color
when
being
poured
into
a
pint
class
with
a
nice
coffee
aroma
it
went
down
easy
for
a
porter
an
enjoyable
brew
my
liver
is
happy
that
i
only
had
one
and
that
it
is
discontinued
because
i
could
definitely
drink
more
of
these
o
interesting
beer
and
enjoyable
but
not
what
i
look
for
in
an
english
porter
or
any
other
porter
for
that
matter
too
much
focus
on
the
roasted
flavors
not
enough
else
going
on
for
depth
also
the
higher
abv
makes
this
a
one
and
done
for
the
night
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
dark
murky
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
lacing
coating
the
glass
a
beautiful
sweet
dark
coffee
aroma
exploded
from
the
glass
a
4
coffee
rarely
smells
this
exciting
the
initial
taste
was
sweet
dark
chocolate
blending
nicely
with
the
sour
notes
a
traditional
english
porter
should
have
sour
aspects
to
it
but
should
not
overwhelm
the
rest
of
the
beer
despite
being
an
imperial
the
sourness
is
well
balance
with
other
aspects
of
the
beer
notes
of
molasses
and
burnt
sugar
were
also
detectable
the
dark
chocolate
and
sour
notes
continue
into
the
aftertaste
but
begin
to
evolve
the
9
15
abv
is
well
masked
until
the
warming
sensation
in
the
aftertaste
lingering
nicely
being
a
porter
the
beer
is
on
the
thicker
side
while
still
being
an
easy
drinker
no
aspect
of
the
beer
overwhelms
allowing
everything
to
be
well
balance
well
done
o
perfect
finish
for
the
cold
day
at
work
outside
id
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
id
order
another
and
buy

with

that

to

that

is
well
hidden
with
only
a

on

overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
imperial
porter
very
robust
and
complex
with
great
flavor
balance
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
highly
enjoyable
o
an
excellent
and
unique
porter
thicker
and
sweeter
than
most
i
have
had
distinctive
is
its
slightly
syrupy
mocha
flavor
this
is
very
good
stuff
and
highly
recommended
o
really
nice
beer
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
traditional
english
porter
well
done
shorts
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
to
be
sure
one
that
pushes
the
boundaries
of
the
style
in
a
surprising
and
interestgrabbing
way
it
will
definitely
help
me
sleep
tonight
quite
nice
and
dangerously
sessionable
overall
wow
this
is
in
a
grey
region
between
stout
and
imperial
porter
but
the
moral
of
the
story
is
that
this
beer
is
amazing
much
stronger
in
flavor
than
i
thought
there
is
a
fantastic
amount
of
chocolate
playing
with
vanilla
in
here
which
comes
out
of
no
where
for
porters
the
sweetness
is
spot
on
i
really
cant
think
of
much
to
be
improved
on
the
taste
front
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
porters
i
have
ever
had
this
is
just
what
beer
is
all
about
do
a
very
filling
beer
to
say
the
least
would
recommend
if
you
are
a
big
porter
fan
thanks
for
this
want
captceleveland
appreciate
it
overall
decent
bigbodied
porter
with
a
tasty
flavor
profile
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
o
at
first
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
but
as
it
warmed
it
grew
on
me
pretty
darn
good
not
the
best
porter
ive
ever
had
but
its
is
still
quite
good
overall
i
didnt
expect
much
after
this
disappointing
woodmaster
but
this
is
a
solid
imperial
baltic
porter
as
good
as
flying
dogs
gonzo
worth
the
high
grade
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
well
made
beer
from
shorts
drinks
nicely
but
it
is
a
touch
of
a
sipper
considering
the
strong
flavors
and
higher
alcohol
content
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
snifter
pours
black
with
a
brown
head
the
aroma
is
medium
to
heavily
roasted
with
dark
creamy
chocolate
up
front
undertones
of
dark
fruitsprunes
brown
sugar
cold
coffee
dark
syrup
and
vanilla
the
flavour
is
medium
sweet
and
light
bitter
with
notes
of
dark
creamy
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
coffeeespresso
on
the
finish
some
brown
sugarmolasses
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
light
sticky
with
a
light
carbonation
maybe
a
touch
of
astringents
bit
sourish
and
acidic
medium
to
full
bodied
overall
a
decent
porter
overall
one
of
the
best
shorts
beers
ive
had
quite
enjoyable
it
gets
better
as
i
drink
it
too
o
if
there
was
ever
a
brewery
that
was
hit
or
miss
it
is
shorts
probably
moreso
than
any
other
publican
porter
however
is
a
hit
really
solid
porter
more
balls
than
youd
expect
for
the
style
and
the
bakers
chocolate
is
rich
enough
that
it
makes
the
style
really
accessible
for
folks
more
on
the
stout
side
of
the
universe
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
this
regularly
oh
wait
shorts
distro
is
nonexistent
oh
well
if
you
get
this
and
are
into
extras
hit
me
up
id
love
some
more
thanks
for
the
taste
really
great
brew
o
i
love
the
way
shorts
pushes
the
boundaries
ill
continue
to
buy
their
out
of
the
box
brews
because
they
make
so
many
hits
unfortunately
thres
the
occasional
chance
of
a
miss
in
there
im
sure
others
as
suggested
by
the
overall
score
will
love
this
beer
while
the
aroma
hints
at
so
much
potential
the
smoke
and
licorice
side
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
bottle
popped
and
poured
into
a
small
delerium
snifter
surprisingly
this
pours
with
very
little
carbonation
or
head
only
a
slight
dark
mocha
tan
head
forms
after
swirling
but
quickly
retreats
to
a
collar
around
the
glass
metallic
right
off
the
bat
but
i
also
get
some
roast
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
booze
in
the
nose
the
aroma
i
am
not
that
keen
on
medium
mouthfeel
velvety
nice
bittersweet
chocolate
roast
leather
and
alcohol
the
bitterness
from
the
roast
cuts
a
little
at
the
end
and
lingers
on
overall
im
not
all
that
impressed
by
this
im
a
little
confused
by
all
the
high
ratings
for
this
the
picture
depicts
one
of
their
one
off
beers
and
the
bottle
i
have
is
a
regular
12oz
i
wonder
if
they
scaled
up
production
and
some
quality
got
lost
in
translation
good
sweetness
solid
roast
and
complex
to
boot
this
has
a
lot
going
for
it
seek
it
out
this
is
a
fine
porter
from
the
bottle
into
a
short
mug
two
fingers
of
caramel
colored
head
near
black
body
warm
and
rosty
hints
of
ripe
fruit
this
porter
is
strong
but
the
alcohol
is
not
prominent
in
mouth
feel
or
taste
perfect
for
a
winter
evening
lovely
with
a
rich
stew
this
one
apparently
was
not
brewed
only
once
12
oz
bottle
this
is
a
thick
viscous
dark
beast
of
a
beer
the
smell
is
sugary
with
cocoa
overtones
the
flavor
is
full
on
kick
ass
englishstyle
porter
yes
it
is
imperial
but
it
isnt
too
boozy
an
unexpectedly
kickass
offereing
edit11913
this
years
is
a
little
less
sweet
with
a
good
aroma
i
like
this
one
a
little
more
shorts
nailed
this
one
overall
this
is
a
really
great
porter
i
wish
i
would
have
grabbed
a
lot
more
of
this
i
could
easily
get
a
case
of
this
without
any
regrets
the
drinkability
is
perhaps
what
makes
this
what
it
is
it
goes
down
so
great
and
has
a
flavor
that
makes
you
want
more
the
alcohol
is
nearly
invisible
im
surprised
i
just
found
out
about
this
gem
from
shorts
recently
look
forward
to
trying
the
rest
pours
nearly
black
in
color
with
a
small
tan
head
quite
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
licorice
some
molasses
and
dark
chocolate
aromas
are
also
present
its
somewhat
oxidized
and
theres
a
little
dark
fruit
character
to
it
a
really
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
to
this
a
hint
of
graham
cracker
and
vanilla
sweetness
theres
a
bit
of
molasses
and
licorice
too
medium
body
with
a
low
to
medium
carbonation
black
opaque
and
a
slight
tan
head
after
a
vigorous
pour
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
molasses
and
dark
fruits
i
taste
big
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
very
robust
this
is
very
much
not
unlike
a
russian
imperial
stout
finishes
dry
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
this
is
too
much
like
an
ris
to
set
it
apart
straight
forward
solid
but
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
even
more
well
worth
trying
overall
not
a
bad
offering
from
shorts
not
quite
up
to
founders
porter
level
but
this
is
a
decent
porter
which
i
could
see
myself
drinking
again
kinda
too
bad
its
a
special
release
will
definitely
grab
another
six
if
it
comes
around
again
and
i
see
it
but
probably
wouldnt
go
to
an
extreme
to
get
it
o
between
this
and
black
cherry
porter
i
really
wish
shorts
would
do
a
yearround
porter
as
they
are
both
very
good
hope
this
becomes
at
least
an
annual
release
if
not
more
often
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
bitterish
coffee
notes
up
front
roasted
malts
follow
but
soon
turn
sweet
and
chocolatey
caramel
and
dark
fruit
play
together
before
iced
mocha
java
takes
us
to
the
finish
notes
of
nougat
vanilla
molasses
smoke
and
peat
flash
here
and
there
and
settle
in
for
a
long
roastysweet
finish
mediumfull
body
with
a
slightly
sticky
feel
a
delicious
sinfully
good
beer
a
great
way
to
start
off
this
new
years
eve
o
it
was
a
very
good
porter
from
shorts
perhaps
id
give
it
higher
marks
if
i
hadnt
be
used
to
drinking
so
many
wonder
barrel
aged
porters
lately
i
do
which
this
or
sustenance
would
be
available
yearend
pours
out
a
dark
brown
hue
that
has
a
thin
tan
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
is
of
chocolateroasted
coffee
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
starts
out
with
chocolate
some
dark
fruit
and
coffee
and
follows
with
some
molasses
and
licorice
the
alcohol
is
covered
quite
well
and
is
a
rather
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
style
and
overall
a
very
well
made
tasty
beer
that
i
would
gladly
buy
again
the
taste
has
a
strong
dark
chocolate
flavor
lots
of
roasted
malt
maybe
some
graham
crackers
and
a
very
slight
bitter
finish
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
keeping
this
very
drinkable
this
appears
a
solid
dark
black
color
with
a
cocoahued
layer
of
foam
sitting
atop
it
it
has
a
great
roasty
aroma
that
carries
over
to
the
taste
i
pick
up
a
lot
of
sharp
roastiness
some
dark
coffee
and
definitely
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
this
is
a
good
one
dark
brown
nice
opagueness
but
still
some
light
through
on
the
sides
and
bottom
nice
short
lived
off
white
head
with
decent
lace
and
audible
carbonation
smell
was
a
decent
english
average
porter
caramel
sugar
and
roasted
malts
were
really
the
most
notable
aromas
the
taste
was
smooth
crisp
a
tad
watery
with
the
caramel
being
mellowed
somewhat
by
a
nice
albeit
small
hoppy
back
overall
every
time
i
come
to
michigan
is
another
chance
to
try
a
new
shorts
beer
if
i
can
find
them
on
tap
i
really
enjoyed
this
full
flavorful
porter
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
if
you
made
it
this
far
in
the
review
i
am
sure
you
can
tell
that
i
really
love
this
beer
it
is
one
of
my
new
shorts
favorites
and
i
am
pretty
damn
excited
that
they
are
going
to
bottle
it
it
is
not
perhaps
the
easiest
drinking
porter
due
to
its
size
but
it
should
be
a
great
fallwinter
brew
that
will
keep
you
full
and
warm
as
you
throw
a
couple
back
with
good
friends
o
every
time
i
drink
a
shorts
beer
in
a
small
bottle
they
leave
me
a
bit
let
down
but
then
we
drink
one
of
these
imperial
bottles
and
they
quickly
win
me
back
i
hope
to
try
some
of
the
other
imperials
some
day
o
really
good
beer
shorts
tries
a
lot
of
interesting
stuff
and
much
of
it
goes
the
wrong
way
but
this
was
something
that
worked
really
well
wish
i
could
get
this
regularly
o
excellent
porter
the
alcohol
is
barely
detectable
and
the
smooth
dark
fruity
chocolate
notes
are
delicious
def
drink
now
as
its
just
on
recommend
d
a
great
porter
outstanding
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
a
palate
cleanser
between
sours
silky
chocolate
chewy
viscous
malty
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
strong
alcohol
and
oak
character
slightly
vinous
with
subtle
hints
of
dark
fruit
subtle
hop
notes
this
provide
slight
balance
and
a
lingering
dry
hot
alcohol
finish
d
damn
tasty
brew
that
is
pretty
drinkable
medium
to
full
body
is
well
carbonated
great
beer
from
shorts
recommended
for
others
but
not
something
i
will
want
to
track
down
again
some
vinous
aged
qualities
in
the
nose
also
tootsie
roll
licorice
and
sticky
molasses
roasty
flavors
of
burnt
toast
wood
and
tobacco
underscored
by
a
mild
yet
pleasant
cranberry
tartness
full
bodied
and
chocolatey
leaning
into
stout
territory
creamy
feel
with
a
dry
finish
easy
drinking
and
a
good
one
to
share
although
its
starting
to
show
its
age
a
little
it
was
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
thanks
again

nice

rbsg09
bottle
at
the
grand
tasting
dark
brown
color
with
mahogany
highlights
and
a
tan
head
some
coffee
aroma
chocolate
malt
balls
typical
wellbalanced
chocolate
and
coffee
with
surprising
notes
of
sherry
and
light
vinegar
clean
dry
finish
interesting
beer
the
taste
is
really
well
done
and
its
apparent
that
time
has
done
this
beer
well
bitter
as
expected
and
relatively
sweet
and
salty
the
sweetness
is
predominantly
chocolate
roasted
malts
with
a
subtle
cola
taste
the
caramel
malts
stick
out
as
well
on
the
finish
an
aged
hop
presence
really
does
this
beer
justice
everything
in
this
beer
works
the
beers
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
works
well
with
the
roast
characteristics
that
come
out
in
the
taste
really
nicely
done
flavor
is
more
roasted
malts
and
some
molasses
this
is
very
full
and
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
just
a
hint
of
hops
noticeable
reminds
me
of
a
expedition
that
is
a
year
or
two
old
very
good
beer
very
solid
very
drinkable
i
shared
some
with
my
dad
but
i
could
have
finished
the
bottle
myself
the
only
potential
impediment
is
the
sweetness
d
its
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
highly
drinkable
but
still
quite
nice
nice
carbonation
and
well
hidden
alcohol
another
solid
brew
from
shorts
this
is
another
original
and
very
tasty
brew
from
shorts
its
got
a
fantastic
nose
with
tons
of
complexity
and
a
solid
flavor
profile
as
well
tastes
carob
chocolate
caramel
cookie
dough
with
chocolate
chips
brown
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
roast
cherry
fruity
rides
clean
alcohol
tries
to
be
sticky
sweet
but
the
alcohol
clears
the
palatte
great
mouthfeel
and
wonderfully
drinkable
has
a
creaminess
that
keeps
the
beer
from
being
too
drying
sweet
in
the
mouth
drying
finish
from
an
acidic
bite
but
not
overly
done
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
had
a
good
viscosity
carbonation
is
on
the
more
mellow
side
which
works
nice
goes
down
almost
too
easily
overall
a
good
imperial
porter
and
it
is
holding
up
extremely
well
after
two
years
in
the
bottle
now
very
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
and
i
hope
shorts
brews
it
again
im
glad
steve
scored
this
i
wouldve
passed
it
up
based
on
the
label
alone
note
knowing
that
the
bottle
was
a
really
nice
beer
its
like
meeting
a
woman
in
a
dark
room
and
after
you
hit
it
off
with
her
the
lights
come
on
and
shes
a
winner
when
you
were
expecting
the
worst
notes
from
82908
d
its
bold
but
i
like
it
thank
you
derek
for
bringing
very
good
roast
aroma
a
dark
thick
chocolate
pour
a
whote
head
with
lots
of
bubbles
thick
and
lacey
down
thye
glass
a
porters
imitation
of
an
imperial
stout
roasted
malt
above
average
mouthfeel
some
sips
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
contained
some
sourness
recommended
this
was
one
of
the
most
hyped
beers
coming
out
of
the
shorts
imperial
series
but
that
might
have
been
because
it
had
the
least
amount
of
bottles
produced
i
really
was
not
all
that
impressed
with
it
though
not
worth
the
twenty
dollars
in
my
opinion
would
not
drink
again
mainly
because
of
the
price
worth
trying
if
possible
a
good
beer
but
from
the
other
reviews
and
noise
ive
heard
from
this
beer
i
expected
a
bit
more
serious
looking
beer
pitch
black
and
opaque
with
a
long
lasting
super
dark
tan
head
outstanding
nose
combines
premium
dark
chocolate
dark
roast
coffee
and
dark
fruit
flavor
is
tremendously
rich
decadent
and
complex
with
layers
of
aged
malt
character
everything
about
this
beer
is
impressive
tank
aged
nearly
8
months
before
bottling
18
months
in
the
bottle
and
shows
no
oxidation
impressive
extraction
and
flavor
concentration
beautiful
dark
color
plus
its
hand
numbered
hand
bottled
and
bottle
conditioned
a
terrific
beer
drinkability
a
porter
par
excellence
and
another
fine
unique
offering
in
a
long
line
of
fine
unique
offerings
from
shorts
pours
ink
black
with
one
of
the
darkest
brown
heads
ive
seen
on
a
beer
full
and
creamy
head
aroma
is
a
very
nice
blend
of
roasty
malts
slightly
smokey
but
more
nutty
good
chocolate
presence
as
well
swirl
in
the
glass
brings
up
some
nice
dark
fruits
raisins
and
prunes
hints
of
dark
molasses
and
bourbony
alcohol
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
follows
the
aroma
dark
fruits
are
more
easily
evident
chocolate
roasty
nutty
malts
a
hint
of
a
grassy
hop
to
balance
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
in
body
very
creamy
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
tingle
n
the
tongue
nice
roasty
after
taste
leaves
just
a
small
bit
of
dryness
and
alcohol
warmth
had
this
one
for
the
first
time
at
the
08
anniversary
party
and
it
blew
me
away
this
however
was
after
much
drinking
at
dl
day
and
had
to
confirm
that
this
wasnt
just
my
warped
taste
buds
talking
that
night
after
killing
the
750
by
myself
tonight
i
can
be
sure
that
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
easily
one
of
my
favorite
shorts
beers
and
possibly
the
best
of
the
imp
series
seek
it
out
before
i
buy
the
rest
initially
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
it
is
quite
heavy
compared
to
the
usual
porter
and
over
time
it
gets
a
bit
too
much
i
did
not
finish
mine
had
this
beer
with
the
saranac
winter
mix
really
loved
the
strong
but
not
overpowering
maple
flavor
with
the
slight
bitterness
of
this
winter
beer
i
would
have
really
liked
to
have
seen
saranac
continue
making
this
one
great
for

on

drinakble
but
there
are
better
porters
out
there
the
last
beer
from
the
saranac
winter
back
i
bought
back
east
as
an
undergraduate
a
few
years
ago
despite
being
a
couple
years
old
this
beer
tasted
about
as
expected
like
an
acceptable
brown
aletoporter
with
a
heap
of
maple
syrup
added
to
it
im
still
on
the
fence
about
adding
extraneous
ingredients
to
beers
as
this
came
off
a
little
artificial
tasting
id
drink
it
again
if
i
stumbled
upon
another
saranac
winter
craft
pack
for
10
but
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
the
last
english
porter
i
had
was
a
taddy
porter
arguably
the
quintessential
english
porter
and
frankly
theres
no
comparison
but
as
a
novelty
its
quite
drinkable
particularly
if
shared
with
another
or
two
i
cant
see
drinking
another
immediately
afterwards

bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
residual
sugars
flavor
is
quite
full
of
maple
syrup
which
basically
dominates
the
flavor
along
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
well
it
is
what
it
advertises
the
aroma
is
pretty
poor
but
the
flavor
is
not
too
bad
overall
a
decent
maplely
beer
although
not
a
classic
porter
at
all
it
barely
resembles
a
porter
actually
dholy
crap
this
one
took
me
by
surprise
i
always
enjoy
saranacs
seasonal
offerings
as
they
are
usually
well
done
but
lackluster
this
is
a
nice

well
thankfully
it
wasnt

the

experience
i
had
with
the
caramel
porter
six
or
so
years
ago
the
sweetness
really
bucks
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
one
a
curious
concoction
though
i
feel
the
two
bottles
in
the
winter
12pack
will
be
more
than
enough
for
me

damn
when

they
really

lets
not

the

the

not

the

bringing
some

goodness

the

the
merriment

not

light
and
the
effervescence
of

subdued

dry
a
decent
easy
drinking
porter
d
this
beer
is
smooth
well
balanced
and
not
too
strong
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
id
want
many
of
these
in
a
row
drinkability
i
could
only
get
one
down
and
this
is
actually
a
goodtasting
beer
while
seemingly
a
paradox
this
beer
is
an
example
of
how
less
is
more
can
often
work
with
beers
of
this
style
notes
for
me
this
beer
is
way
too
sweet
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
i
should
be
putting
this
on
pancakes
or
something
drinkability
for
me
is
very
low
as
i
couldnt
see
drinking
any
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
d
good
drinkability
from
the
mouthfeel
but
the
strong
taste
makes
this
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
session
drinks
well
hereno
hang
upsgoes
down
pretty
easysessionable
great
job
saranac
this
was
the
last
rating
from
saranacs
twelve
beers
of
winter
sampler
i
have
to
agree
with
a
forum
topic
a
few
weeks
ago
about
mattsaranac
stepping
up
their
act
they
did
a
pretty
nice
job
on
this
particular
sampler
pack
overall
a
very
very
solid
ale
and
probably
my
favorite
of
the
mix
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
this
one
again
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
nothing
to
remark
about
overall
i
really
like
this
porter
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
brown
color
with
some
slightly
reddish
hues
that
appeared
when
it
was
held
up
to
the
light
it
was
light
in
color
for
a
porter
the
retention
was
ok
and
the
lacing
stringy
the
aroma
was
of
maple
syrup
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
chocolate
malt
the
flavors
were
also
dominated
by
the
maple
flavor
but
it
came
off
as
quite
artificial
as
my
friend
aptly
put
it
its
like
aunt
jemima
took
over
my
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
good
very
light
for
a
porter
and
sadly
very
one
dimensional
as
well
just
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
want
a
porter
and
not
one
id
recommend
the
pour
produced
a
finger
of
deeptan
head
exploding
with
co2
bubbles
color
was
a
deep
colabrown
with
ruby
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
coffeelike
roastiness
accompanied
by
a
chocolaty
sweetness
mouthfeel
seemed
thin
for
a
porter
and
the
prevalent
taste
on
the
tongue
was
a
roasted
bitterness
almost
coffeelike
the
finish
was
when
i
really
caught
the
maple
syrup
flavoring
mentioned
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
frankly
as
one
of
the
six
different
beers
in
the
twelve
beers
of
winter
pack
i
was
satisfied
viva
la
difference
especially
for
the
price
on
its
own
perhaps
not
so
much
d
a
drinkable
beer
but
is
that
what
you
really
want
in
a
maple
porter
imho
a
good
maple
porter
should
satisfy
you
after
one
beer
preferably
matched
with
some
rich
chocolate
cake
or
a
small
bowl
of
maple
walnut
ice
cream
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
a
neophyte
to
this
style
of
beer
without
scaring
the
pants
off
them
overall
i
did
not
like
this
beer
when
i
saw
maple
porter
it
sounded
like
something
amazing
but
i
was
very
disappointed
cheers
overall
one
of
the
better
brews
out
of
the
winter
sampler
in
my
opinion
i
liked
it
its
a
little
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
is
very
smooth
pissed
i
only
have
2
of
these
this
beer
is
surprisingly
light
easy
drinking
and
goes
down
smooth
but
its
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
liking
it
was
ok
and
id
have
it
again
if
it
came
in
a
saranac
variety
pack
but
i
would
never
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
nice
effort
and
experiment
by
saranac
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
it
might
be
a
good
breakfast
beer
if
you
were
out
all
night
but
not
a
session
beer
d
clever
curious
original
and
fun
this
ones
not
a
session
beer
for
me
its
just
too
damn
sweet
and
mapley
one
of
them
is
fine
but
then
im
ready
to
move
on
curiously
it
improves
with
food
spicy
chipotle
chili
is
a
good
companion
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
mostly
candy
sweet
with
a
little
maple
character
but
not
a
ton
of
toasted
malt
this
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
for
a
porter
but
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
bad
the
maple
isnt
as
present
as
i
expected
and
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
with
some
crisp
carbonation
not
what
i
expected
when
i
first
saw
it
but
not
in
a
completely
disappointing
way
pours
a
very
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
lace
of
slightly
tanned
head
minor
retension
and
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
around
the
glass
the
color
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
to
me
it
looks
more
like
a
brown
ale
than
a
porter
nose
has
a
sweetness
similar
to
brown
sugar
mixed
with
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
sweet
upfront
but
not
malty
sweet
more
of
a
sugarlike
sweetness
i
am
guessing
from
the
maple
addition
kinda
bland
tasting
throughout
the
body
to
a
minorly
bitter
finish
light
feel
and
moderately
carbed
it
finished
quite
crisp
it
is
not
bad
the
maple
seems
a
bit
much
and
overall
nothing
exciting
d
a
quaffable
porter
just
extremely
light
on
taste
and
feel
to
really
consider
this
an
indulgent
brew
but
a
pretty
good
light
porter
nonetheless
and
probably
a
good
introduction
to
someone
wanting
to
try
this
style
this
is
hardly
a
traditional
porter
by
any
means
and
the
fact
that
you
can
really
taste
the
roast
of
the
malt
may
throw
some
people
off
this
includes
me
i
dont
really
feel
you
should
be
able
to
taste
this
much
roasted
malt
also
its
missing
the
slight
bitterness
of
many
of
the
english
porters
ive
enjoyed
maple
why
not
an
interesting
idea
and
executed
reasonably
well
just
wish
this
had
more
of
the
characteristics
of
a
true
porter
poured
from
the
bottle
out
of
the
winter
sampler
pack
brown
color
with
hints
of
red
moderately
thick
light
tan
head
left
minimal
lacing
as
it
faded
smells
of
caramel
toffee
maple
and
a
hint
of
nuttiness
tastes
almost
exactly
as
it
smells
the
maple
comes
through
strongly
there
is
a
flat
sweetness
to
the
initial
taste
it
finishes
with
a
moderate
bite
that
lingers
after
you
swallow
i
was
somewhat
surprised
that
the
beer
tastes
better
colder
than
when
allowed
to
sit
for
awhile
mouthfeel
is
truly
average
as
rated
it
is
sort
of
flat
but
not
entirely
unpleasant
drinkability
is
dependent
on
your
tolerance
for
maple
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
became
slightly
less
enjoyable
as
it
sat
longer
in
the
glass
overall
not
bad
but
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
might
be
too
many
this
is
a
good
dinner
beer
or
a
night
cap
dont
think
i
want
to
drink
6
or
7
of
these
the
same
goes
for
the
overall
feeling
for
this
beer
it
would
be
an
ok
beer
with
some
good
qualities
if
it
were
not
for
the
awful
fake
flavor
recommended
poured
from
12
ounce
bottle
rich
dark
color
bitter
sweet
scents
of
chocolate
although
it
does
smell
kinda
dry
brown
sugar
maple
chocolate
caramel
flavors
all
combine
together
this
beer
seems
to
be
very
chewy
pretty
drinkable
as
a
desert
brew
i
split
this
beer
with
my
wife
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
d
better
than
the
average
saranac
but
not
the
best
example
of
a
porter
a
bit
thick
to
drink
many
fortunately
it
is
currently
a
part
of
the
winter
collection
2
seems
right
in
the
pack
drinks
okay
but
between
the
thinness
the
fake
flavor
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
d
i
forced
myself
to
finish
the
glass
it
wasnt
a
horrific
beer
or
anything
just
overdone
on
the
maple
and
residual
sweetness
and
underwhelming
with
the
lost
potential
to
be
a
good
beer
as
is
i
find
it
barely
mediocre
the
mixture
of
tastes
of
maple
syrup
and
chocolate
malt
is
what
will
make
or
break
this
beer
for
my
money
this
is
just
an
excellent
pairing
of
tastes
nice
offering
from
saranac
i
agree
with
some
of
the
other
reviewers
that
this
may
be
a
mix
between
a
nut
brown
and
porter
i
would
drink
this
again
theres
nothing
holding
me
back
from
drinking
this
one
again
in
a
room
full
of
bmcs
im
definitely
going
for
this
and
in
a
room
full
of
say
fullers
or
samuel
smiths
keeping
with
style
id
reach
for
those
instead
d
a
good
porter
it
lacks
the
normal
saranac
house
flavor
which
is
unusual
for
one
of
their
ales
d
not
too
bad
but
a
little
too
sweet
too
be
drinkable
the
maple
is
there
but
too
sweet
to
make
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
a
somewhat
unbalanced
porter
where
the
flavor
profile
does
not
present
as
much
maple
as
burnt
sugar
an
interesting
take
on
a
porter
but
not
my
personal
favorite
d
i
had
to
move
on
immediately
after
one
but
saranac
is
smart
like
that
they
give
you
two
of
a
kind
in
each
of
these
seasonal
packs
so
if
one
brew
is
forgettable
i
e
this
porter
you
can
mosey
on
to
the
next
variety
this
porter
just
has
no
legs
to
stand
on
drinkability
is
above
average
smooth
comforting
no
bitterness
no
harshness
low
abv
i
could
drink
the
shit
out
of
these
all
night
pours
a
little
lightcolored
for
a
porter
with
minimal
head
as
is
indicative
of
the
saranac
brand
the
smell
promises
chocolate
and
a
faint
hint
of
maple
duh
the
taste
delivers
while
most
porters
and
stouts
taste
like
dark
chocolate
the
maple
in
this
brew
softens
it
making
it
sweet
and
delicious
ive
long
thought
of
saranac
as
a
halfassed
brewery
for
its
thin
watery
beers
but
now
im
starting
to
think
that
maybe
they
do
it
for
a
good
reason
not
everyone
likes
a
strong
highapc
beer
and
for
those
among
us
with
softer
more
sensitive
palates
saranacs
maple
porter
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
drinkability
a
brilliant
beer
i
want
more
weak
but
different
and
not
bad
the
maple
though
balanced
slightly
does
dominate
but
really
in
the
end
it
does
get
tiresome
after
the
bottle
is
done
and
its
just
too
sweet
without
much
body
or
depth
still
if
you
like
maple
syrup
its
worth
giving
it
a
shot
copped
as
part
of
a
twelvepack
winter
variety
sampler
certainly
not
your
conventional
english
porter
watereddown
taste
and
flavor
weak
output
few
hints
of
maple
if
any
in
the
overall
flavor
profile
not
impressed
with
this
offering
i
have
often
looked
down
on
saranac
beers
as
macro
in
taste
average
stuff
and
not
recommended
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
clear
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
dissolves
into
a
thin
film
and
laced
well
maple
and
roasted
malt
aromas
at
first
sip
you
get
the
roasted
bitterness
but
it
finishes
with
maple
sweetness
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
in
it
made
my
lips
a
little
sticky
overall
a
really
good
porter
again
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
saranac
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
the
body
seems
a
bit
heavy
for
an
english
porter
this
is
a
drikable
social
beer
but
it
does
cloy
and
one
must
choose
a
followup
beer
wisely
as
there
will
be
lingering
maple
and
chocolate
on
the
tongue
d
a
fairly
lightbodied
porter
it
may
be
too
sweet
for
most
porter
drinkers
not
exactly
a
sipper
but
it
serves
its
purpose
d
once
it
grows
on
you
this
becomes
quite
the
drinkable
brew
id
def
have
this
one
again
again
this
is
an
over
the
top
offering
from
saranac
for
those
fond
of
maple
syrup
and
sweet
malty
beers
this
is
for
you
a
memorable
and
flavorful
beer
drinkability
interesting
not
something
i
will
be
craving
though
not
convinced
this
would
be
a
good
tasting
porter
if
the
maple
syrup
was
eliminated
t
its
extremely
sweet
the
maple
completely
comes
through
and
even
has
a
candy
taste
to
it
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
likes
cheers
the
only
thing
i
will
say
was
that
it
went
down
smoothly
and
was
easy
to
drink
because
it
was
very
cleanly
brewed
making
it
pretty
drinkable
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
this
is
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
but
it
was
actually
quite
pleasant
and
a
huge
improvement
over
the
caramel
porter
that
used
to
go
in
these
winter
packs
nothing
spectacular
but
another
solid
brew
out
of
this
rejuvenated
winter
pack
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
mix
of
dark
brown
and
ruby
a
thinner
off
white
head
atop
leaving
minimal
lace
as
it
settled
quickly
decent
aromas
mainly
of
roast
and
chocolate
malta
light
leafy
note
shows
through
as
the
beer
warms
as
well
a
pretty
balanced
porter
with
good
roast
and
earthy
tones
mixed
with
sweetish
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
that
maple
syrup
a
little
prickly
in
the
mouth
but
this
a
decent
porter
to
be
had
drinkability
a
very
solid
sessionable
beer
this
is
in
a
high
tier
of
maple
beer
probably
just
after
tommyknocker
and
kanc
county
the
maple
is
a
tad
artificial
tasting
but
not
enough
to
throw
off
the
enjoyment
this
is
my
favorite
in
the
winter
pack
the
label
brings
back
memories
from
my
first
job
working
tapping
maple
trees
in
the
hills
of
west
virginia
with
a
retired
local
surgeon
collecting
sap
and
boiling
it
down
at
the
sugar
shack
i
love
this
process
and
outcome
true
maple
syrup
is
a
godly
creation
this
porter
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
caramel
ruby
highlights
large
khaki
tan
head
forsm
thick
with
chunky
lacing
aroma
has
dark
chocolate
cocoa
and
an
air
of
maple
syrup
about
it
nice
sweet
dark
and
roasty
a
good
mix
for
the
senses
flavor
is
upfront
with
the
sweet
maple
syrup
additions
with
a
nice
straight
forward
porter
with
dark
roasts
bringing
mild
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
finihs
herbal
earthy
hops
come
to
play
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
really
an
english
style
porter
with
maple
syrup
flavoring
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
cloying
with
the
acidic
nature
of
the
finish
with
thos
maple
syrup
notes
drinkability
overall
is
decent
not
a
beer
im
dying
to
try
again
but
very
tolerable
and
at
times
straight
up
enjoyable
overall
a
tasty
addition
to
the
saranac
stable
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
nice
off
white
head
to
it
with
plenty
of
lacing
one
of
the
more
appealing
pours
ive
seen
in
a
while
the
taste
was
a
little
disappointing
for
me
has
an
alright
mouthfeel
but
theres
really
nothing
special
taste
wise
about
this
one
barely
even
a
hint
of
maple
and
not
much
of
the
usual
roastiness
found
in
a
porter
drinkable
but
not
really
memorable
for
flavorful
for
me
i
dug
this
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
being
that
it
is
pretty
strong
in
flavor
could
not
see
myself
putting
back
too
many
however
i
thought
this
sounded
good
and
it
was
i
enjoyed
md
medium
body
sticky
easy
to
drink1
i
like
it
but
wouldnt
get
it
again
probably
d
overall
a
worthy
porter
suitable
for
your
after
dinner
drink
this
is
yet
another
good
saranac
offering
very
nice
d
wow
i
am
pleasantly
suprised
with
the
flavor
of
this
brew
nice
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
selection
for
gatherings
definitely
a
case
worthy
selection
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
26591138
sampled
on
november
12
2009
it
pours
an
opaque
brownred
and
is
not
as
dark
as
traditional
porters
there
is
almost
no
head
and
what
there
is
simmers
down
to
nothing
in
no
time
there
is
a
notable
maple
scent
with
the
malts
and
hops
but
it
is
not
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
body
the
taste
has
a
more
pure
maple
flavor
than
the
aroma
the
roadted
malts
and
hops
are
almost
secondary
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
bottle
of
maple
syrup
but
it
is
nowhere
near
as
thick
interesting
beer
although
it
seems
more
suited
for
early
spring
when
the
maple
sap
is
flowing
overall
very
enjoyable
could
use
a
little
more
mmphh
but
another
good
offering
from
saranac
this
years
winter
variety
pack
is
quite
a
good
buy
for
14
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
amber
highlights
peaking
through
big
frothy
khaki
colored
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
pint
settling
into
a
nice
cap
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
and
maple
syrup
quite
sweet
some
toffee
and
metal
notes
kind
of
like
a
coffee
flavored
candy
very
light
roasted
malt
flavor
a
touch
grainy
maple
syrup
burnt
toffee
finishes
with
a
lemony
tartbitterness
the
feel
is
quite
light
with
fizzy
carbonation
the
maple
syrup
sweetness
would
probably
get
cloying
after
one
beer
an
ok
porter
probably
could
use
some
more
body
and
roasted
flavor
the
maple
isnt
terrible
but
would
probably
be
better
suited
with
more
of
a
malt
body
overall
i
like
it
i
loved
the
vanilla
porter
last
year
as
well
who
knows
what
they
will
porterize
for
next
year
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
a
seasonal
12pack
at
shaws
in
windham
nh
pours
a
copperbrown
crystalclear
body
with
a
good
inch
of
somewhat
shortlived
light
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
espresso
dark
chocolate
with
tinges
of
vanilla
and
maple
in
the
aroma
chocolate
and
espresso
dominate
the
flavor
too
with
caramel
maple
and
hints
of
vanilla
reminds
me
initially
of
kahlua
minus
the
booziness
mediumbodied
with
ample
carbonation
the
sweet
chocolatiness
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
not
sure
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
maybe
it
has
to
do
with
the
kahlua
perception
but
its
sweet
and
fairly
balanced
a
wellmade
porter
and
well
worth
the
try
the
beer
pours
a
tranlucent
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
scent
with
a
little
crystal
malt
sweetness
there
is
little
to
no
maple
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
maple
syrup
in
the
finish
there
is
light
sweetness
with
a
bone
dry
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
prickly
carbonation
this
could
be
a
really
good
beer
but
it
needs
some
basic
adjustments
d
id
have
a
few
of
these
quite
possibly
the
best
saranac
ive
ever
had
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
they
should
put
it
into
the
32
oz
mini
growlers
i
see
their
black
forest
in
occasionally
id
buy
em
for
sure
well
it
is
a
maple
porter
i
just
wish
it
was
a
bit
thicker
also
the
maple
tastes
kind
of
fake
as
well
regardless
still
drinkable
d
a
very
good
brew
from
saranac
nice
flavor
the
maple
was
not
too
overpowering
allowing
the
robust
porter
flavor
come
through
bought
the
2009
12
beers
of
winter
last
night
and
so
far
i
am
quite
pleased
the
maple
porter
i
really
wasnt
expecting
much
from
but
i
am
very
pleasantly
surprised
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
and
it
all
works
very
well
together
the
maple
is
pretty
convincing
and
tastes
better
than
most
of
the
stuff
that
you
get
on
your
waffles
these
days
the
porter
is
more
of
a
complimentary
flavor
set
and
does
not
take
center
stage
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
beer
would
be
weak
watery
and
perhaps
too
bitter
as
a
porter
on
its
own
luckily
the
maple
is
there
to
harmonize
and
bring
this
beer
to
the
next
level
if
you
do
not
like
maple
syrup
you
will
probably
hate
this
beer
but
it
really
struck
a
chord
with
me
and
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
this
in
a
brewers
choice
6pack
this
winter
saranac
maple
porter
is
a
clear
orangish
brown
ale
with
a
frothy
khaki
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
smells
very
roasty
like
coffee
lightly
sweet
and
perhaps
a
touch
wooden
its
medium
bodied
bubbly
pretty
smooth
and
dry
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
like
the
aroma
it
tastes
very
roasty
with
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
its
excellently
balanced
with
a
bitterness
that
seems
wooden
the
maple
comes
at
and
after
the
finish
thats
the
flavor
that
lingers
this
beer
is
well
done
unique
and
very
drinkable
