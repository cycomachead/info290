final
thoughts
all
in
all
it
was
an
interesting
experience
but
i
wouldnt
say
ill
be
eagerly
awaiting
my
next
black
and
tan
all
it
all
i
think
it
was
a
posistive
experience
but
really
the
rummy
carbonation
note
needs
some
work
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
okay
flavors
and
aromas
o
ive
never
had
anything
from
hockley
in
the
past
this
is
okay
unfortunately
somewhat
forgettable
the
flavor
is
better
than
the
smell
would
indicate
there
are
elements
of
a
stout
black
coffee
and
burnt
grain
and
a
pale
ale
nice
hop
finish
the
body
is
too
thin
for
any
beer
closer
to
soda
good
aftertaste
of
mocha
and
white
pepper
this
poured
with
a
finger
of
foamysoaping
head
which
reduced
quickly
and
leaft
no
lacing
it
has
an
opaque
black
body
on
the
aroma
i
get
mostly
licorice
but
also
dark
and
cold
coffee
and
rootbeer
i
find
the
taste
to
be
tangy
with
the
flavours
of
roasted
malts
with
the
the
coffee
and
licorice
it
ends
with
a
hit
of
hops
i
find
both
the
body
and
carbonation
to
be
lowtomedium
but
it
has
a
very
silky
smooth
feel
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
good
pick
bts
are
scarce
around
here
but
if
anyone
were
to
ask
me
to
recommend
one
this
would
probably
be
my
first
choice
ill
probably
get
it
again
at
some
point
too
people
hoping
for
a
sweeter
dark
beer
like
typical
brown
ales
or
maybe
some
stoutsporters
may
be
disappointed
but
i
still
like
what
hockley
has
done
here
worth
a
try
overall
a
perfectly
pleasant
and
wellrounded
example
of
a
black
and
tan
but
it
doesnt
set
the
world
alight
and
make
me
wish
i
had
more
mouthfeel
aggressively
carbonated
okay
carbonation
overall
a
decent
drink
o
surprised
to
see
this
as
a
packaged
beverage
props
for
creativity
a
decent
enough
drink
worth
a
purchase
but
id
rather
have
it
made
at
the
pub
this
is
an
interesting
beer
comes
off
strong
but
very
light
tasting
carbonation
makes
the
beer
a
little
unbalanced
but
overall
tasty
and
drinkable
worth
a
try
o
another
decent
offering
from
hockley
i
grabbed
in
their
summer
mixer
pack
no
reason
not
to
try
this
one
and
the
price
is
right
so
thats
a
selling
point
a
nice
tasting
beer
worth
checking
out
a
decent
enough
robust
blend
of
a
beer
except
for
the
dodgy
somewhat
unpleasantly
pithy
bitter
character
perhaps
hard
to
say
exactly
from
which
side
of
the
dual
inputs
that
this
originates
but
this
would
be
all
the
more
enjoyable
in
its
absence
black
and
tans
havent
really
hit
the
spot
for
me
yet
this
is
just
an
okay
beer
that
really
looked
good
when
poured
this
one
really
surprised
me
theres
a
great
dark
beer
hidden
away
in
this
can
that
hits
all
the
high
notes
for
an
easydrinking
dark
ale
and
the
abv
keeps
it
well
within
session
beer
range
of
which
it
will
make
a
very
satisfying
one
indeed
ill
be
going
back
for
more
of
this
for
sure
there
are
no
off
flavours
and
the
toolight
body
does
come
with
the
benefit
of
added
drinkability
i
cant
say
im
a
fan
of
black
and
tan
but
it
is
certainly
drinkable
i
can
even
see
this
being
enjoyable
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
such
a
beverage
d
pretty
good
drinkability
being
light
and
dry
makes
this
an
easy
quaffer
but
the
darkness
adds
some
nice
flavour
drink
the
beer
had
a
nice
smell
and
taste
but
it
came
across
as
too
thin
and
watery
with
a
little
tinkering
this
could
be
a
really
good
beer
for
a
cold
beer
on
a
surprisingly
hot
day
from
my
local
lcbo
this
was
not
too
bad
pours
brownish
with
spider
with
a
lacing
trail
a
significant
sour
edge
that
builds
up
it
is
medium
mouthfeeled
and
sweetish
but
not
too
sweet
has
some
interesting
notes
that
contribute
to
drinkability
malt
aroma
ill
get
this
one
again
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
it
would
be
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
back
in
a
pub
or
on
a
deck
or
a
couch
i
think
i
cellared
this
can
of
beer
a
little
too
long
but
overall
it
still
impressed
id
like
to
try
it
fresher
next
time
hockley
valley
had
done
two
delicious
oneoffs
for
a
local
cask
festival
dubbed
black
forest
stout
and
peanut
butter
and
jam
ale
both
of
which
i
enjoyed
tremendously
this
strongly
reminds
me
of
them
not
the
least
because
its
flavourful
sessionable
and
appreciably
wellcrafted
fortunately
unlike
the
other
two
this
is
one
i
can
have
again
this
marks
my
first
black
and
tan
and
hockley
valley
provided
me
with
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
its
not
all
that
exciting
but
i
find
the
concept
pretty
interesting
and
im
happy
i
could
get
my
hands
on
a
rare
style
like
i
said
earlier
the
stout
in
the
beer
is
much
more
dominant
then
their
golden
ale
and
i
think
overall
this
probably
helped
the
beer
id
be
open
to
trying
other
interpretations
of
the
style
but
probably
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
nothing
really
remarkable
here
basically
an
irish
stout
that
has
been
mellowed
out
a
bit
not
quite
my
thing
but
an
interesting
change
of
pace
nb
this
is
rated
to
style
all
things
being
equal
id
have
scored
this
a
lot
lower
but
for
a
black
tan
its
surprisingly
decent
front
side
is
malt
forward
you
get
roast
and
toastiness
some
nutlike
tones
all
well
balanced
with
a
sturdy
pleasing
hop
bitterness
finish
remains
roastytoast
with
good
hop
balance
then
a
quick
dry
bitter
end
very
pleasant
very
rounded
balanced
and
finished
like
a
porter
with
more
pale
malt
instead
of
caramalt
or
crystal
very
drinkable
a
dark
sessioner
pours
a
dark
brown
with
thin
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
smell
is
very
subtle
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
some
roasted
chocolate
taste
with
mild
bitterness
nice
carbonation
level
and
i
could
drink
several
of
these
nothing
really
great
here
but
it
still
is
pleasant
enough
a
mix
of
phoenix
pale
ale
and
oreillys
irish
stout
the
combination
ends
up
a
clear
chestnut
colour
and
came
topped
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
good
retention
with
some
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
basically
roasted
barley
and
grapefruit
hoppiness
kind
of
a
weird
combo
but
appealing
solid
bitterness
with
light
caramel
some
roast
and
burnt
character
and
lingering
citrus
mediumlight
body
and
carbonation
fairly
dry
this
really
works
the
flavours
meld
quite
well
producing
a
highly
drinkable
beer
NA
NA
food
match
continuing
on
the
theme
of
mixing
two
opposing
styles
together
i
say
lamb
souvlaki
and
pad
thai
the
pad
thai
could
be
mixed
in
the
wrap
im
going
to
go
make
some
now
carbonation
is
much
too
high
and
the
body
feels
watery
really
not
a
great
beer
and
something
which
doesnt
seem
to
match
up
to
what
a
black
tan
should
be
it
is
possible
that
this
is
an
infected
bottle
and
will
possibly
rereview
in
the
future
but
at
the
moment
this
is
not
a
great
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
hits
a
lot
of
the
right
notes
at
the
right
times
and
again
as
a
virgin
to
the
style
im
going
to
have
t
count
myself
as
a
fan
it
has
the
brooding
mustiness
of
a
rich
stout
but
its
finish
is
very
clean
and
bitterhoppy
with
a
pleasing
if
slightly
musty
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
very
nicely
full
with
a
slick
character
that
carries
the
flavour
well
without
feeling
too
heavy
an
eminently
drinkable
drop
refreshing
pleasant
and
nicely
balanced
d
nice
beer
i
think
id
rather
drink
the
gippsland
gold
or
hat
lifter
stout
by
themselves
though
depending
what
mood
im
in
ok
so
this
is
my
first
black
and
tan
lets
see
how
it
goes
poured
a
dark
brownnearly
black
complexion
with
a
nice
half
inch
thick
white
head
that
i
wasnt
expecting
smell
was
just
how
i
would
expect
an
ale
and
a
stout
to
smell
together
cloudy
faint
aromas
taste
was
similar
with
coffee
some
soy
sauce
a
bit
of
chocolate
here
and
there
good
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
but
besides
that
there
was
a
lot
more
happening
here
im
not
quite
sure
what
but
it
went
down
very
easily
therefor
i
can
say
that
it
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
overall
a
good
intro
to
black
and
tans
hopefully
the
ones
i
try
in
the
future
will
be
as
good
as
this
one
was
cheers
however
this
is
a
very
drinkable
blend
perhaps
owing
a
little
too
much
of
its
pleasantness
to
the
wonderful
gippsland
gold
but
who
knows
well
a
fairly
soso
beer
nothing
to
get
terribly
excited
about
i
thought
the
idea
of
a
black
and
tan
in
a
bottle
was
odd
as
it
seems
more
of
a
specialty
ontap
offering
oh
well
have
to
say
i
think
this
is
my
second
fav
grand
ridge
beer
next
to
the
gippy
gold
very
intresting
brew
indeed
when
it
comes
down
to
it
the
concept
of
brewing
an
actual
black
and
tan
is
pretty
cool
the
problem
is
that
you
try
each
of
these
beers
gippsland
gold
and
hatlifter
stout
separately
they
are
really
good
beers
try
them
here
together
it
seems
they
have
subdued
each
other
making
it
it
yourself
with
the
same
beers
is
much
much
better
as
the
flavors
of
both
still
have
full
effect
great
idea
tho
pretty
good
gets
the
roastiness
from
there
stout
and
that
buttery
toffee
characteristic
from
the
gippsland
gold
pretty
good
some
oilyness
but
has
a
nice
dry
finish
also
fairly
light
but
being
a
black
and
tan
i
dont
think
its
meant
to
be
particularly
heavy
a
pleasant
beer
and
easy
to
get
in
to
pretty
tasty
enjoyable
o
this
beer
tastes
like
a
blend
between
an
american
black
ale
and
an
american
stout
with
the
black
ipa
flavors
being
stronger
its
easier
to
drink
but
i
think
i
would
have
liked
this
more
if
the
stout
flavors
were
a
little
stronger
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
and
tan
but
somehow
the
style
never
really
seems
to
be
as
good
as
the
sum
of
the
different
beers
being
blended
something
gets
lost
bottle
to
tulip
pours
dark
brown
with
a
small
kahki
head
my
first
black
and
tan
other
than
yuengling
i
am
assuming
this
bottle
is
a
little
older
than
is
optimal
but
thats
ok
aroma
is
really
interesting
pine
and
citrus
up
front
with
string
sweet
roasted
malt
notes
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
molasses
flavor
is
big
sweet
notes
followed
by
lingering
roast
only
a
bit
of
bitter
pine
and
it
is
just
a
bit
overly
sweet
but
not
undrinkable
medium
slick
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
cool
beer
taste
is
definitely
a
nice
blend
of
hoppy
ipa
and
roasted
stout
lots
of
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
this
pretty
much
is
a
black
ipa
extreme
departure
from
a
traditional
black
tanwhich
is
ok
cause
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
being
a
big
fan
of
a
good
bt
this
one
was
actually
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
fun
to
try
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
drink
for
the
1st
of
the
style
it
wasnt
half
bad
seemingly
one
sided
but
i
guess
if
i
have
more
i
have
a
good
base
of
which
to
judge
which
way
this
will
go
overall
i
liked
this
alot
its
fun
to
drink
since
its
two
beers
in
one
i
was
plesantly
surprized
at
the
hop
character
it
had
but
it
still
had
enough
stout
to
it
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
ill
have
this
again
overall
nice
tasty
experience
not
sure
ill
be
back
for
much
more
but
definitely
the
best
black
and
tan
ive
ever
had
then
again
not
gonna
mix
hopslam
and
fbs
to
try
and
best
it
very
interesting
balance
and
enjoyable
beer
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
that
i
prob
wouldnt
make
my
go
to
i
am
a
much
bigger
fan
of
the
different
parts
of
this
brew
and
would
probably
be
more
inclined
to
make
my
own
mix
boris
is
no
joke
and
pretty
heavy
i
might
prefer
a
bit
less
boris
in
the
mix
decent
combination
of
their
ipa
and
oatmeal
stout
d
overall
this
was
a
very
drinkable
black
and
tan
a
nice
mix
of
flavor
and
feel
make
it
worth
a
try
o
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
i
dont
enjoy
bitter
beers
most
ipas
so
i
had
some
reservations
about
this
brew
hoppin
frog
shines
once
again
with
another
solid
offering
overall
neither
flavor
is
really
that
great
but
the
balance
between
stout
and
ipa
is
appropriate
d
im
starting
to
get
into
black
ipas
more
i
hadnt
really
thought
about
why
someone
thought
of
the
style
but
it
seems
like
it
might
have
been
created
to
recreate
the
sensations
of
a
black
and
tan
o
while
i
appreciate
what
this
beer
is
i
think
the
two
beers
mixed
together
are
better
served
in
their
own
bottles
nice
to
try
but
not
my
favorite
offering
from
this
great
brewery
o
pretty
good
definitely
interesting
and
different
but
probably
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
even
though
i
wasnt
fond
of
this
experience
i
finished
the
beer
concentrating
on
the
boris
portion
in
the
glass
this
wasnt
that
hard
as
boris
was
the
bigger
player
despite
being
outnumbered
two
to
one
it
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
bottle
of
boris
now
mouthfeel
is
similarly
an
exercise
in
extremes
the
oatmeal
earthy
character
and
acidity
is
really
nice
and
goes
well
with
citrusy
hops
in
the
middle
but
the
excessive
burnt
flavors
dont
combine
great
with
the
hoppy
dry
bitterness
body
is
smooth
fluid
and
crisp
at
least
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
excess
in
everything
but
the
beer
isnt
tough
to
down
over
time
this
is
a
tough
style
to
judge
but
this
beer
is
probably
a
good
representative
of
it
pours
very
dark
bordering
on
black
with
a
good
tan
head
nice
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
is
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
forward
lots
of
roasted
malt
along
with
some
mild
piney
hops
touch
of
earthiness
in
the
background
the
flavor
consists
mostly
of
roasted
malt
with
some
mild
bitterness
coming
through
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
presence
on
the
swallow
as
well
pretty
drinkable
probably
the
best
bottled
black
tan
that
ive
had
and
worthy
of
the
1
slot
here
on
ba
the
cpj
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
smooth
and
delicious
the
33
b
o
r
i
s
oatmealimperial
stout
presents
itself
boldly
at
times
and
it
seems
like
it
is
actually
a
higher
percentage
than
stated
the
bitterness
on
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
and
the
best
bitter
taste
ive
ever
experienced
i
have
not
had
very
many
black
and
tans
before
but
this
one
was
by
far
the
best
medium
bodied
that
is
pretty
hop
forward
with
hints
of
earthy
pine
and
sweet
citrus
flavor
slightly
bitter
and
floral
but
balanced
by
roasted
chocolate
malt
licorice
hazelnut
and
toffee
this
beer
is
aggressively
hopped
and
seems
more
like
a
black
ipa
up
front
with
hops
that
linger
throughout
into
a
dry
finish
slightly
smokey
toward
the
end
of
the
palate
with
hints
of
licorice
and
roasted
malt
slightly
sweet
dry
finish
weird
d
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
not
something
id
like
to
drink
everyday
i
think
half
of
the
reason
people
like
black
and
tans
is
for
the
ascetic
appearance
of
the
two
beers
being
layered
this
just
tastes
like
a
hoppy
stout
a
great
and
unique
stab
at
the
style
though
i
dig
it
it
is
a
mix
of
67
percent
ipa
and
the
rest
is
stout
daring
combination
aroma
is
strongly
hoppy
with
a
background
of
smoky
oily
mocha
and
hints
of
charred
wood
and
brown
sugar
it
pours
a
lovely
darkchocolate
brown
with
a
very
thick
light
tan
head
that
hands
around
for
a
bit
and
leaves
some
substantial
lacing
flavor
has
the
hoppiness
and
grapefruit
hint
of
a
good
ipa
and
the
roast
quality
coffee
unsweet
chocolate
and
molasses
tones
of
a
good
stout
the
disparate
flavors
do
not
fight
but
complement
each
other
very
nicely
it
has
hints
of
both
hoppy
bitterness
and
molasses
sweetness
that
are
nicely
balanced
texture
is
smooth
and
tingly
leaving
behind
both
subtle
hop
bitterness
and
a
whisper
of
sweetness
as
well
as
a
fairly
persistent
fizz
the
stout
and
ipa
elements
are
all
very
good
and
the
mixture
of
23
ipa
and
13
stout
makes
them
balance
very
well
i
love
both
stouts
and
ipas
and
this
beer
has
the
best
of
both
worlds
bodacious
indeed
although
the
strong
bite
at
the
finish
pretty
much
wipes
out
any
residual
roasty
maltness
overall
a
very
nice
beer
perhaps
this
is
a
black
ipa
probably
the
best
premixed
black
tan
ive
had
but
the
mix
is
not
really
as
good
as
the
sum
of
its
parts
in
my
opinion
still
good
though
final
notes
however
you
drink
this
its
a
great
beer
and
likely
the
best
black
and
tan
thats
commercially
brewed
youll
ever
find
if
you
like
a
super
hoppy
and
bitter
beer
drink
it
fresh
and
its
a
perfect
black
ipa
flavorwise
if
you
prefer
to
get
more
of
the
b
o
r
i
s
flavors
then
age
this
beer
a
few
months
to
mellow
the
hops
enough
that
they
dont
quash
all
the
wonderful
stoutness
this
is
how
i
prefer
this
beer
d
a
great
blend
very
smooth
and
nice
tasting
with
a
great
balance
i
like
this
way
more
than
i
was
expecting
to
and
im
sad
to
see
the
bottle
empty
d
i
simply
love
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
given
the
chance
i
may
have
to
trade
for
a
case
of
this
drinkability
great
drinkability
i
finished
my
22
oz
bomber
in
about
an
hour
and
i
was
upset
that
i
didnt
have
another
i
would
love
to
drink
more
than
1
in
a
night
but
it
gets
to
be
pricey
when
you
can
only
buy
8
bombers
of
it
this
one
hides
the
alcohol
nicely
and
is
a
treat
to
drink
if
you
have
not
tried
a
black
and
tan
brew
this
is
the
one
that
you
should
try
hands
down
quite
a
nice
black
and
tan
but
then
again
a
black
and
tan
is
only
as
good
as
its
base
components
and
both
base
beers
for
this
one
are
excellent
the
stout
brings
some
nice
roasty
and
chocolate
flavors
and
the
ipa
brings
some
nice
citrus
fruitiness
and
sweet
malt
pours
black
with
a
nice
initial
head
and
some
scant
lacing
smells
dry
and
a
tad
dusty
with
cocoa
and
citrus
peel
nicely
balanced
flavors
with
the
dry
chocolate
of
the
stout
and
the
juicy
citrus
of
the
hops
combining
very
nicely
and
creating
a
long
pleasant
bitter
finish
with
a
touch
of
rich
but
dry
sweetness
at
the
base
bitter
and
dry
in
the
mouth
quite
nice
as
i
mentioned
earlier
i
was
unsure
of
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
it
turned
out
very
nicely
and
i
can
see
myself
purchasing
this
again
at
999
22oz
however
it
could
be
a
little
bit
before
i
pick
up
another
ten
dollars
is
totally
worth
it
though
if
youve
never
tried
this
overall
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
and
that
was
a
very
good
thing
a
fantastic
really
really
interesting
and
different
take
on
the
style
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
its
not
one
id
seek
out
again
especially
for
a
9
bomber
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
out
of
this
beer
which
is
surprising
because
i
enjoy
both
of
the
base
beers
i
was
shown
to
be
incorrect
in
my
assumptions
the
juxtaposition
of
flavors
and
aromas
work
very
well
worth
a
shot
drinks
pretty
well
one
of
these
would
be
enough
for
me
i
really
enjoy
the
attempt
at
this
beer
but
the
flavor
just
doesnt
mesh
as
well
as
id
hoped
a
unique
beer
that
is
worthy
of
a
try
hf
is
not
a
bad
brewery
at
all
its
just
that
their
beers
arent
worth
the
cost
d
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
mind
to
get
my
hands
on
a
case
of
this
to
share
with
friends
overall
a
great
blend
of
two
great
beers
this
turned
out
much
better
than
id
expected
looks
more
like
a
stout
but
the
nose
and
taste
is
more
like
a
black
india
ale
one
worth
having
again
another
great
brew
from
hoppin
frog
this
was
my
first
review
of
a
black
and
tan
i
wont
buy
again
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
interfere
with
the
flavors
at
all
this
beer
is
awesome
to
drink
as
you
get
the
flavor
profiles
of
both
the
ipa
and
the
stout
and
they
alternate
throughout
the
taste
d
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
what
i
expected
the
drinkablity
is
the
best
part
pours
pitch
black
with
a
nice
and
fluffy
tan
head
aroma
is
mostly
pine
tree
and
pine
needle
smelling
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
caramel
when
you
drink
it
its
mostly
stoutish
as
is
tastes
very
coffee
like
roasty
full
bodied
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
this
stuff
truly
is
a
beautiful
mix
of
a
great
ipa
and
a
great
stout
d
im
impressed
this
may
be
the
first
black
and
tan
that
i
have
ever
actually
liked
the
blend
is
well
done
with
noticeable
contributions
from
each
beer
it
is
a
testament
to
the
obscene
intensity
of
the
stout
that
it
dominates
the
flavor
even
though
it
is
only
13
of
the
blend
despite
the
stouts
flavor
dominance
the
ipa
makes
a
significant
hop
aroma
contribution
and
adds
a
hop
flavor
backbone
that
was
sadly
lacking
in
the
strait
imperial
stout
in
the
end
this
really
comes
off
as
a
weaker
version
of
what
i
had
hoped
boris
would
be
the
ipa
dilutes
the
overwhelming
sticky
malt
soup
of
the
stout
and
balances
it
with
a
hop
character
that
not
only
makes
it
more
drinkable
but
also
works
with
the
dark
malts
to
add
complexity
especially
in
the
finish
that
was
simply
not
there
before
if
they
brewed
this
as
one
beer
turned
everything
up
about
20
and
called
it
an
imperial
porter
it
could
be
their
best
beer
and
it
might
even
live
up
to
the
hype
that
boris
has
somehow
generated
the
aroma
is
both
very
hoppy
and
very
toasted
with
chocolate
coffee
and
molasses
the
appearance
is
dark
with
a
tan
head
and
a
few
particles
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
and
bitter
coffee
finish
the
palate
is
smooth
and
thick
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
black
and
tan
d
very
drinkable
but
somewhat
filling
with
the
combination
of
ipa
and
stout
this
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
session
beer
but
nevertheless
a
nice
drinkable
experiment
purchased
this
22
oz
bomber
from
shoreline
beverage
in
huntington
ny
pours
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
lingers
around
for
a
while
aromas
are
of
citrus
pine
needles
and
roasted
malts
at
67
ipa
there
is
a
good
dose
of
hops
up
front
the
stout
flavors
then
kick
in
and
at
only
33
it
seems
to
balance
everything
out
quite
effectively
overall
satisfying
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
i
wish
there
were
more
these
hybrid
type
beers
out
there
they
are
a
nice
twist
d
drinkablity
was
moderate
with
decent
enjoyment
though
it
didnt
make
me
enthused
nor
excited
to
look
forward
to
the
next
sip
a
decent
combo
of
citrusy
hops
and
dark
roasted
backing
but
nothing
that
hasnt
been
done
before
and
better
thought
the
citrusy
nature
wasnt
as
dominant
or
bright
as
it
could
have
been
d
easily
drinkable
but
a
little
overwhelming
i
might
rather
a
glass
of
each
rather
than
one
mashed
together
in
the
black
and
tan
style
not
sure
how
to
rate
this
considering
it
isnt
really
a
style
but
here
it
goes
anyway
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
reach
for
one
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
the
taste
doesnt
quite
bring
together
the
flavors
as
well
as
i
would
like
id
probably
just
prefer
a
hoppy
ris
as
opposed
to
a
blend
but
this
is
a
very
good
black
and
tan
drinkability
is
good
this
bomber
went
down
fast
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
its
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
stout
or
a
black
ipa
its
still
a
tasty
beer
with
a
fairly
hefty
fullness
to
it
a
bomber
was
nice
to
try
but
this
just
seems
like
a
novelty
that
could
just
be
served
at
the
brewpub
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
poured
into
a
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
beer
appears
a
clear
deep
dark
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
tan
head
nose
and
flavor
are
of
bakers
chocolate
medium
roasted
grain
earthy
bitter
hops
dark
malt
and
caramel
at
the
least
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
a
great
bt
two
great
beers
combine
to
make
a
good
one
this
is
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
stick
to
the
individual
components
blipped
ballad
of
bodacious
by
primus
i
think
its
silly
to
bottle
preblended
black
tans
id
rather
make
my
own
combos
and
get
the
delightful
split
coloration
this
brew
is
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
hoppin
frogs
got
one
kick
ass
beer
with
bodacious
black
tan
the
only
thing
that
could
effectively
improve
this
beer
is
a
little
more
body
it
really
performs
well
allaround
otherwise
this
absolutely
has
to
be
the
most
underrated
overlooked
beer
brewed
in
ohio
with
the
recent
recognition
of
b
o
r
i
s
im
hopeful
that
more
will
take
a
chance
on
this
gem
from
hoppin
frog
i
swear
you
will
not
be
the
least
bit
disappointed
overall
a
tasty
and
unique
black
and
tan
d
i
had
one
of
these
ended
up
being
two
das
boots
i
could
have
gone
for
one
or
two
more
but
past
that
i
would
have
been
on
the
floor
a
nice
and
very
different
beer
quite
a
nice
mix
that
i
would
buy
again
if
i
saw
in
a
store
drinkability
well
what
do
you
know
a
beer
i
have
been
delaying
trying
mainly
because
of
my
disappointment
over
buying
the
wrong
thing
turns
out
to
be
very
good
this
is
a
standout
blend
beer
and
one
of
the
top
rated
active
bottled
beers
of
style
bomber
man
that
frog
do
hop
i
must
start
by
saying
that
ive
never
made
or
tasted
a
black
tan
this
hoppy
if
it
werent
for
the
silkiness
of
the
stout
id
be
convinced
i
was
drinking
a
good
hoppy
porter
picture
having
your
local
beerjockey
whip
up
a
bt
with
beamish
and
boulders
cold
hop
and
youve
just
about
got
it
a
wonderful
beer
with
a
great
hop
flavor
smooth
mouthfeel
a
little
smoke
on
the
back
end
and
a
nose
full
of
hops
ill
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this

it
does
have
something
of
a
late
kick
but
still
very
drinkable
an
enjoyable
blended
beer
ipa
and
stout
different
for
a
black
and
tan
and
works
well
a
black
ipa
is
pretty
much
what
it
comes
down
to
with
characteristics
of
both
blending
well
this
beer
with
an
aggressive
pour
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
2
fingered
light
tan
head
with
some
lacing
the
majority
of
the
smell
seems
to
smell
like
chocolate
covered
cherries
the
taste
is
very
unique
i
have
never
really
mixed
any
craft
beers
before
but
this
shows
me
what
it
could
bring
you
get
the
nice
chocolate
and
cherry
flavors
from
the
boris
with
an
ipa
bitter
end
to
it
very
interesting
the
mouthfeel
seems
ok
a
little
undercarbonated
imo
i
could
drink
1
or
2
of
these
but
i
doubt
more
than
that
in
an
evening
drinks
very
easy
usually
not
a
style
that
thrills
me
i
think
kicking
this
up
a
notch
or
2
really
made
this
work
for
me
this
would
also
work
as
an
export
stout
imo
i
feel
it
is
hard
to
judge
a
black
tan
in
a
bottle
but
this
is
a
decent
offering
from
hoppin
frog
dthe
combination
of
the
two
beers
makes
for
a
good
drinking
experience
i
like
blending
beers
at
bars
and
tend
to
do
a
lot
of
hoppymalt
combos
the
ratio
they
have
here
works
well
though
i
might
prefer
a
bit
more
of
the
stout
this
combo
reminds
me
somewhat
of
the
black
ipa
stone
produced
a
while

a
nice
black

nice

this
is

one
of
the
best

ive
encountered
lately
black

a
great
accomplishment

oh
its
not
a
bad
blend
i
suppose
but
id
rather
have
had
the
black
and
skipped
the
tan
altogether
not
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
just
being
honest
the
punk
frog
on
the
label
deserves
at
least
that
much
tasted
on

pours
a
light

an
almost
complete
ring
of
beige
foam
makes
the
track
the
lacing
is
very
sparse
and
thinbut
holds
for
quiet
sometime
the
aroma
is
a
very
spicy
hop
citrus
with
some
light
lingering
notes
of
marshmellow
chared
malts
and
some
coffee
makes
me
think
of
a
black
ipa
the
taste
fits
the
perception
of
a
black
ipa
perfectly
very
unique
favors
the
hoppy
bitterness
mixes
with
dark
toasted
malts
of
the
r
i
s
the
hops
take
up
most
of
the
flavor
profile
notes
of
grapefruit
peels
maybe
a
little
licorice
with
some
vanilla
toffee
malts
almost
brunt
malt
profile
very
roasty
bitter
and
oily
palate
feels
very
good
on

of

this
is
a
great
blending
two
great
beers
hop
accented
nose
with
hints
of
fruits
pours
rustic
but
appears
dark
brown
in
the
glass
flavor
is
mainly
hop
accented
but
especially
as
it
warms
hints
of
roast
and
chocolate
come
about
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
but
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
stout
and
a
bit
less
ipa
a
decent
bt
i
prefer
a
regular
pa
comared
to
the
ipa
when
mixed
in
one
of
these
or
maybe
i
would
have
prefered
a
little
more
of
the
stout
in
the
mix
worth
a
try
poured
with
a
brownish
color
head
and
was
pretty
black
in
color
chocolate
malts
hit
me
very
faintly
in
the
background
while
the
hops
were
right
there
sorta
tasted
like
an
imperial
stout
at
first
but
then
the
hops
kicked
in
and
then
it
went
back
to
the
dark
malt
taste
by
the
time
i
swallowed
heavier
on
the
mouth
good
balance
of
smell
and
taste
between
the
2
styles
bitterness
kinda
lingers
a
little
bit
on
after
taste
pretty
good
brew
to
me
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
flavorful
and
satisfying
interesting
and
definitely
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
style
but
the
astringency
kind
of
builds
on
this
one
and
make
it
a
bit
of
a
onepinter
worthy
a
try
not
bad
at
all
complex
and
reminds
me
of
the
many
blends
i
have
concocted
over
the
years
one
pint
did
me
just
fine
had
this
in
the
22
oz
bottle
great
appearance
solid
black
color
with
a
thin
dark
brown
head
that
laces
away
quite
nicely
aromas
are
quite
nice
mixes
giving
it
its
bodacious
title
i
guess
nice
subtle
hops
and
malts
combined
with
a
bready
wheaty
textures
that
are
nicely
roasted
and
chocolatewrapped
whats
great
is
that
all
of
these
smells
really
are
subtly
combined
so
that
nothing
is
either
overpowering
or
strange
taste
wise
is
smoother
and
cleaner
than
the
smell
would
have
you
believe
more
roasty
and
mochacoffee
flavors
than
what
could
have
been
with
the
ipa
flavors
mouthfeel
works
well
with
this
drink
giving
it
a
smooth
creamy
texture
gelling
all
flavors
together
overall
wicked
bodacious
drinkability
is
basically
perfectit
is
bold
and
flavorful
without
being
overfilling
or
overly
bitter
alcoholic
and
is
anything
but
boring
really
really
good
wow
talk
about
the
best
of
both
worlds
both
these
beers
are
great
together
and
this
mashup
of
styles
more
than
holds
its
own
packed
with
full
flavor
while
still
remaining
very
quaffable
this
is
one
black
tan
style
to
check
out
d
the
last
on
my
beerstotry
from
hoppin
frog
list
turns
out
to
be
a
real
diamond
in
the
rough
maybe
its
time
to
put
my
old
stubbornness
aside
and
make
a
few
blackntans
out
of
old
favorites
unless
it
would
be
possible
to
brew
a
stout
with
this
much
hop
character
hmmm
american
imperial
russian
india
oatmeal
stout
yeahhhh
mouthfeel
was
easy
to
drink
but
still
had
a
full
flavor
not
smooth
but
not
slick
very
enjoyable
quite
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
but
not
overwhelming
pours
a
deep
brownblack
with
1
inch
of
foamy
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
citrus
caramel
pine
maple
sugar
chocolate
and
coffee
just
like
mixing
their
ipa
and
stout
taste
is
also
a
nice
blending
of
the
two
ales
with
a
start
of
grapefruit
and
pine
mixing
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
backbone
as
well
as
caramel
and
a
finish
of
chocolate
and
bitter
coffee
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
smooth
and
sweet
with
good
roastiness
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
easy
to
drink
great
flavors
definitely
could
drink
this
often
ive
been
impressed
with
the
hoppin
frog
brews
so
far
i
love
the
ipas
and
dipas
and
have
just
begun
to
enjoy
many
of
the
stouts
this
gives
me
the
best
of
both
worlds
would
i
drink
this
all
the
time
no
but
it
was
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
drinkability
a
delicious
beer
wth
lots
to
enjoy
sometimes
too
much
of
a
good
thing
is
exactly
what
it
seems
it
would
be
such
is
the
case
herestout
and
ipa
i
mean
you
have
to
try
it
maybe
if
you
like
mcgriddles
this
could
be
your
beer
for
me
it
was
as
good
as
it
could
have
been
not
very
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
hoppin
frogs
and
perhaps
a
road
trip
the
brewery
offers
four
packs
mixed
appears
a
beautiful
jet
black
hue
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
thick
tan
moccha
head
forms
even
bands
of
lace
all
around
my
pint
glass
aromatics
bring
dark
roasted
malt
with
cramy
sweet
molasses
and
caramelized
brown
sugar
wrapped
around
fruit
namingly
plum
or
raisinwith
hops
backin
it
up
citric
and
pine
like
there
flavors
collied
bringing
upfront
chocolate
roasty
notes
this
is
basically
boris
the
crusher
lite
the
ipa
gets
over
shadowed
by
the
roasted
malts
much
like
this
years
stone
anniversary
black
ipas
are
somewhat
of
a
contradiction
this
mix
of
the
two
works
so
well
67
hoppin
to
heaven
ipa
and
33
boris
ris
big
roasted
malt
with
dark
chocolate
dryness
blended
with
sweet
fruity
citric
hops
mild
alcohol
finishes
so
lucious
and
juicy
with
hop
flavor
more
so
in
the
pine
department
mouthfeel
is
fuller
bodied
creamy
textured
evenly
carbonated
and
just
plain
kick
ass
butter
smooth
like
a
couple
of
slabs
of
parkay
even
flow
till
the
22
oz
disappears
drinkability
is
caseworthy
or
just
buy
a
case
of
their
ipa
and
boris
and
blend
yourself
that
way
you
will
have
three
different
beers
from
two
cases
i
like
that
idea
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
two
finger
brown
sugartinted
rocky
head
of
dense
cream
excellent
retention
leaves
spiderweb
lacing
the
aroma
of
stout
prevails
here
dark
chocolate
and
deeply
roasted
barley
dark
caramel
and
blackstrap
molasses
with
some
light
toffee
an
american
citrus
hop
note
is
just
perceivable
in
the
background
the
first
sip
is
sweet
with
dark
crystal
malt
and
caramel
the
flavor
slowly
turns
to
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
and
finally
ends
with
a
drying
charred
taste
and
a
solid
fruity
american
hop
aftertaste
a
complex
beer
for
the
style
with
much
greater
depth
and
range
than
average
the
sweetness
tickles
the
palate
upfront
then
transformes
into
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
and
is
wellbalanced
by
the
burnt
character
and
hop
bittnerness
that
eventually
dries
the
tounge
and
halts
residual
sweetness
the
body
is
a
standard
medium
and
ligter
than
the
nose
suggests
and
carbonation
is
light
allowing
the
robust
flavors
the
linger
a
moment
before
being
swept
away
while
this
is
surely
more
formidable
a
beer
than
most
black
and
tans
the
drinkablity
is
good
so
long
as
you
like
a
good
stout
or
ipa
on
its
own
if
one
were
looking
for
a
bt
to
crossover
from
macros
one
should
look
elsewhere
the
finish
is
dry
and
holds
onto
the
roast
character
with
a
hint
of
cascade
but
nothing
overpowering
a
terrific
and
innovative
twist
on
the
style
as
well
as
a
solution
to
turning
out
an
addition
offering
from
a
new
brewery
operated
by
one
man
ask
him
about
serving
this
beer
through
coffee
beans
or
fresh
hops
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
dark
brown
head
over
the
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
head
is
going
nowhere
fast
coating
the
glass
with
a
solid
thin
layer
of
lace
aroma
is
roasty
dark
malt
with
pine
hops
character
taste
starts
with
the
dark
stout
character
then
gives
way
to
the
hoppy
ipaness
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
easy
might
have
gone
a
little
overboard
with
the
ipa
side
of
this
equation
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
brew
a
deep
dark
black
to
brown
color
with
hints
of
red
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
very
thin
beige
head
forms
on
top
dissolving
away
slowly
alot
of
malt
sweetness
at
first
in
the
scent
then
folowed
by
a
distinct
citrus
and
grassy
fragrances
at
the
end
th
e
malt
comes
out
at
the
start
with
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
maybe
a
hint
of
some
dried
fruit
then
halfway
an
intense
grapefruit
bitterness
hits
the
palate
folowed
by
some
grassy
and
earthy
flavors
at
the
end
the
is
surprisingly
medium
bodied
it
does
gain
some
weight
after
each
taste
this
is
an
easy
to
sip
beer
it
brings
strong
flavor
and
aroma
to
the
table
making
this
a
beer
to
try
body
pours
to
a
blackish
brown
with
a
huge
fat
dark
tan
and
brown
colored
head
much
more
black
than
tan
hops
are
loud
and
zesty
up
front
of
the
nose
wheaty
malt
balances
this
nicely
though
an
abrubt
herb
laced
bitter
enters
the
mouth
with
first
sip
hints
of
root
beer
and
tea
leaves
come
through
on
the
early
palate
almost
has
a
menthol
effect
when
teamed
with
the
burnt
malt
richness
twords
the
end
ot
the
palate
a
slight
hint
of
coco
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
slightly
thick
drinkably
unique
d
best
black
and
tan
i
have
had
so
far
nice
blend
to
create
what
tastes
like
a
very
hoppy
imperial
stout
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
hefty
oatmeal
stout
scent
that
boasts
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
earthy
oatmeal
presence
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
bitter
and
earthy
taste
the
black
malts
and
hops
combine
for
a
huge
bitter
blast
its
got
the
stout
feel
but
is
lighter
and
easier
to
put
down
nevertheless
its
still
rich
and
filling
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
good
black
and
tan
most
are
lighter
and
easier
drinking
but
this
one
sacrifices
nothing
in
the
way
of
malt
character
and
alcohol
content
drinkability
hell
yeah
have
a
bunch
of
these
this
is
a
nice
rich
brew
that
splits
the
difference
between
a
stout
and
an
ipa
recommended
a
nice
combination
of
the
oatmeal
stout
characteristics
and
a
lot
of
hoppiness
i
appreciated
the
oatmeal
more
by
itself
but
it
was
a
good
twist
on
it
and
very
drinkable
a
way
of
consuming
more
oatmeal
just
a
few
days
after
the
original
bomber
without
feeling
overdone
dark
colour
and
lots
of
aroma
of
the
two
fully
carbonated
not
a
bad
blend
but
the
way
the
stout
emphasis
in
the
smell
doesnt
sync
up
with
the
hop
emphasis
of
the
flavor
is
a
bit
confusing
i
liked
this
one
more
than
i
anticipated
still
seems
like
an
oddity
d
the
wellmixed
beer
looking
like
a
stout
smelling
like
an
ipa
and
tasting
like
a
hybrid
of
both
is
delicious
im
half
tempted
to
stock
up
on
the
base
ingredients
and
mixing
my
own
its
weird
how
its
23
ipa
and
13
stout
by
the
appearance
and
the
taste
id
have
guessed
the
opposite
bottle
is
a
22
oz
bomber
which
is
a
67
ipa
hoppin
to
heaven
and
33
stout
boris
mix
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
an
inch
and
a
half
brown
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
good
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
citrusy
hops
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
it
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
way
it
smells
except
that
theres
some
coffee
in
the
taste
too
theres
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
bitter
with
this
beer
however
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
stronger
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
at
all
theres
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
good
balance
between
the
ipa
and
stout
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
its
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
too
its
nice
and
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
brew
a
lot
definitely
a
good
choice
in
my
opinion
even
without
checking
my
reviews
im
certain
that
bodacious
black
tan
is
the
best
version
of
this
style
that
ive
ever
had
nothing
else
is
even
close
if
i
ever
move
back
to
ohio
finding
the
nearest
source
for
hoppin
frog
beer
will
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
priorities
d
this
is
not
your
grandpas
black
and
tan
with
67
hoppin
to
heaven
ipa
and
33
b
o
r
i
s
this
is
a
big
beer
the
black
malt
bitterness
and
roasted
qualities
really
support
the
hop
flavor
nicely
both
the
ipa
and
the
imp
stout
are
complex
beers
and
most
of
those
flavors
come
through
in
this
beer
this
is
a
big
beer
but
it
is
a
nice
session
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
drinkability
im
really
not
too
sure
about
this
one
i
know
not
many
breweries
do
a
take
on
a
black
and
tan
but
i
can
understand
why
they
dont
its
probably
one
of
the
better
bottled
black
tans
out
on
the
markets
now
but
i
dont
want
to
spend
another
7
for
another
one
it
would
be
easier
and
cheaper
to
make
one
for
yourself
if
you
love
taking
your
micro
beers
and
making
them
into
a
black
and
tan
then
you
might
like
this
one
for
me
im
done
with
this
one
recommended
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
the
result
of
mixing
two
very
solid
beers
i
really
like
boris
and
hopping
to
heaven
is
no
slouch
either
the
individual
beers
are
much
better
than
this
mixture
the
beer
seems
to
be
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
the
smells
and
flavors
of
this
mixture
dont
do
any
justice
the
beers
components
the
beer
is
barely
ok
to
drink
stick
to
the
beers
individually
nice
try
but
back
to
the
drawing
board
eric
it
is
my
opinion
that
batchmixed
bts
just
dont
do
any
justice
for
all
parties
involved
d
drinkable
but
i
hope
this
gets
better
with
his
next
batch
d
call
this
the
hopheads
black
and
tan
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
bts
but
i
definitely
find
this
one
palatable
with
that
said
i
find
the
ipa
and
stout
to
both
be
much
better
separately
than
in
this
creation
poured
a
darker
brownish
amber
color
with
a
small
wispy
head
aroma
of
sweet
dark
malts
honey
a
mild
roastiness
detected
essence
of
indistinct
dark
fruits
mirroring
the
nose
the
beer
tasted
sweet
with
dark
malts
and
honey
some
mineralphenolic
thinness
notes
of
raisins
and
smoke
mild
earthiness
a
little
clashy
but
not
bad
once
you
realize
whats
going
on
medium
body
lower
carbonation
and
a
decent
drink
overall
id
estimate
it
around
67
abv
maybe
a
bit
warming
thin
and
strange
but
drinkable
in
its
own
way
medium
to
light
in
the
feel
with
smooth
light
carbonation
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
brew
it
isnt
your
typical
black
and
tan
this
was
probably
the
best
of
the
beers
i
tried
at
the
scale
house
as
the
roasted
flavor
was
pleasant
and
muted
the
rest
of
the
flavors
a
bit
off
tap
at
the
brewery
this
black
and
tan
was
a
copper
color
with
wisps
of
tan
foam
atop
it
that
quickly
faded
away
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
slightly
nutty
with
a
light
dry
roasted
malt
presence
the
flavors
were
almost
exactly
like
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
bittering
from
illdefined
hops
ok
but
not
what
a
black
and
tan
should
be
and
clearly
an
extract
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
average
would
probably
purchase
again
although
they
have
another
offering
that
i
like
even
more
brown
with
red
highlights
with
an
off
white
head
with
fair
retention
and
lacing
smells
and
tastes
like
caramel
dark
roasted
malt
and
bread
a
bit
thin
and
watery
with
decent
carbonation
not
much
aftertaste
not
much
to
get
excited
about
but
not
bad
either
pour
was
lighter
side
of
brown
with
a
slight
ruddy
tint
not
a
lot
of
head
and
lacked
lacing
smell
was
lightly
malty
taste
was
similarly
malty
with
a
mild
sweetness
that
finished
crisp
and
dry
enough
not
to
be
annoyingly
sweet
light
body
drinkable
average
o
not
good
not
bad
average
at
best
really
easy
to
drink
but
didnt
really
intrigue
me
at
all
wouldnt
probably
get
again
too
many
other
good
ticks
to
be
had
out
there
the
two
pull
was
an
interesting
combination
between
the
northern
lights
and
the
brother
benedict
bock
the
combination
made
for
a
decent
tasting
beer
i
appearance
was
average
lighter
clear
amber
not
much
head
and
no
lace
the
smell
was
a
maltier
version
of
the
northern
lights
lager
the
taste
was
much
better
than
the
bock
by
itsself
the
lager
helped
to
smooth
out
the
heavy
grainbarley
taste
of
the
bock
mouthfeel
was
good
the
bock
gave
the
beer
a
little
body
and
the
lager
made
teh
beer
drinakable
overall
it
was
ok
teh
ipa
was
much
better
just
thought
that
i
would
add
a
few
things
here
in
my
city
the
two
pull
varies
depending
on
who
pours
it
varying
amounts
of
the
2
flavors
greatly
change
the
tastedrinkability
but
overall
its
a
solid
choice
for
me
and
at
6
on
tues
and
thurs
you
cant
go
wrong
with
the
cost
either
my
brother
law
shared
the
growler
with
me
he
picked
this
one
up
in
toledo
d
this
is
really
not
bad
at
all
drink
em
down
note
this
is
a
combo
of
granite
citys
light
and
bock
style
beers
this
is
only
the
second
time
i
have
heard
about
combining
beers
like
this
but
it
works
well
this
time
o
a
good
beer
for
a
chain
brewpub
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
i
would
choose
this
over
the
likes
of
your
typical
macrobrew
i
go
to
granite
city
for
the
food
but
i
enjoy
two
pulls
while
im
there
overall
i
am
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
easy
drinking
yet
full
of
flavor
the
25
oz
mug
went
fast
give
this
one
a
try
when
you
are
visiting
tasted
ontap
051105
at
the
cedar
rapids
ia
location
pours
a
nicely
dark
almost
coke
like
color
with
a
tan
finger
and
a
half
almost
two
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
traditional
lager
behind
it
taste
of
chocolate
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
coffee
with
the
flavor
of
the
traditional
lager
in
the
back
ground
very
ever
so
slightly
creamy
and
goes
down
smooth
and
very
refreshing
for
a
dark
beer
compared
to
most
ive
had
not
quite
a
craft
beer
but
not
just
your
normal
either
definitely
recommend
it
to
someone
who
wants
to
get
into
craft
beers
excellent
place
to
start
pours
a
dark
brown
color
holding
it
to
the
light
it
appears
burnt
red
in
color
very
little
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
roasted
malts
some
cocoa
and
coffee
but
a
main
wiff
of
corn
resides
tatse
follows
the
nose
slightly
more
pleasant
than
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
light
somewhat
watery
but
overall
not
bad
i
would
just
rather
thier
porter
for
black
and
tans
i
just
make
my
own
its
not
bad
for
the
price
but
it
is
what
it
is
pours
dark
brown
little
creamy
tan
head
smells
roasty
with
crisp
crackery
malts
tastes
of
malts
slight
sunflower
seed
smooth
lasting
finish
decent
beer
for
less
than
a
dollar
a
bottle
a
nice
dark
nearly
black
color
it
is
an
entirely
enjoyable
beer
considering
the
price
i
got
a
dozen
of
the
the
16
ounce
cans
for
one
dollar
each
the
other
day
no
not
the
best
ever
but
i
enjoyed
them
not
a
top
of
the
line
brew
but
you
know
that
when
you
purchase
them
grainy
and
burnt
flavors
from
the
porter
mix
with
the
base
yuengling
that
just
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
porter
flavors
a
bit
metallic
with
some
cocoa
drinkable
but
not
the
easiest
to
get
through
my
go
to
cheap
easy
drinking
beer
easy
drinking
smooth
finish
good
price
i
like
the
darker
beer
and
this
was
great
strong
beer
flavor
it
wasnt
that
heavy
either
there
is
nothing
really
special
about
this
one
the
lager
is
so
much
better
o
not
a
favorite
too
light
for
a
good
porter
my
go
to
good
all
around
decent
flavors
drinks
like
a
porter
heck
4
99
six
pack
bring
them
on
nice
kool
liked
this
as
a
nice
cheap
everyday
type
beer
as
i
always
enjoyed
black
and
tans
then
made
the
mistake
of
drinking
one
after
having
some
very
good
ipas
its
exactly
what
the
ratings
give
it
an
ok
alternative
to
a
black
n
tan
draft
overall
a
nice
change
from
the
typical
yuengling
beer
i
would
have
it
again
not
an
easy
drinker
or
exciting
flavor
profile
this
is
really
a
go
to
beer
for
me
when
i
need
a
break
from
hi
octane
craft
brews
its
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
however
for
an
everyday
affordable
beer
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
blah
what
a
waste
if
you
want
a
good
black
and
tan
just
make
one
glass
sa
perfect
pint
glass
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
possessing
some
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
mingled
with
some
semisweet
and
semisour
due
i
guess
to
corn
adjuncts
its
pleasant
but
very
forgettable
id
much
rather
have
a
traditional
black
tan
half
and
half
of
guinness
and
newcastle
or
a
yuengling
porter
or
oktoberfest
over
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
smooth
and
flavorful
has
nice
sweet
tones
not
bitter
at
all
ive
had
this
a
couple
of
times
never
did
really
like
it
i
like
this
beer
except
for
that
sweetness
in
the
middle
price
makes
this
a
high
value
beer
and
the
low
alcohol
content
4
7
on
this
site
is
a
bonus
for
me
i
love
this
beer
in
cans
only
1214
pours
dark
brown
light
reflects
a
deep
red
fast
fizz
little
foam
small
roasted
nose
lighter
malt
taste
is
a
lighter
dark
malt
that
fades
fast
and
finishes
like
a
lager
kind
of
exactly
what
i
expected
not
bad
for
a
premixed
black
and
tan
beer
dark
with
a
slight
bitterness
overall
id
say
that
i
liked
the
black
half
of
this
beer
but
am
unsure
that
the
tan
really
added
much
to
the
mixture
i
havent
had
yuengling
porter
and
yeungling
premium
beer
individually
stores
around
here
only
seem
to
carry
their
traditional
lager
black
tan
and
light
lager
so
i
cant
really
compare
the
black
tan
to
each
of
its
component
parts
just
yet
but
im
assuming
iand
anyone
else
who
likes
those
chocolatey
darker
beer
flavorswould
probably
prefer
the
porter
over
this
one
o
good
flavor
and
a
great
lightness
and
crisp
taste
great
for
the
summer
months
if
you
want
a
darker
beer
cheap
as
well
overall
a
good
beer
real
similar
to
the
traditional
lager
so
if
you
like
that
then
you
will
probably
like
this
gives
a
little
something
different
from
the
traditional
however
it
is
ever
so
slight
my
go
to
cheep
beer
how
can
i
rate
it
any
less
then
great
one
of
the
better
picks
for
an
affordable
borderlinemacrobrew
go
to
has
a
stale
taste
very
filling
wouldnt
recommend
love
the
full
flavor
taste
one
of
my
favorites
for
sure
well
the
black
and
tan
was
what
it
was
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
a
little
i
was
expecting
a
little
bitter
more
from
my
first
beer
from
a
brewery
with
such
a
long
history
but
this
one
failed
to
deliver
hopefully
if
i
ever
get
to
try
their
dark
brewed
porter
or
their
premium
lager
individually
they
will
come
out
better
than
this
combination
of
the
two
did
the
beer
was
too
basic
for
my
liking
and
the
porter
part
seemed
to
dominate
but
when
the
lager
did
making
an
appearance
it
wasnt
welcome
and
seemed
to
negatively
impact
the
taste
this
one
isnt
a
beer
id
be
eager
to
try
again
but
i
wouldnt
mind
get
my
hands
on
some
of
the
brewerys
other
beers
overall
worth
a
try
although
i
could
pick
50
different
products
i
would
rather
have
than
this
if
i
were
to
take
a
trip
to
pa
and
bring
back
beer
hell
just
standard
yuengling
is
better
although
i
think
this
is
rated
a
bit
low
on
this
site
at
least
i
got
to
watch
the
chiefs
take
it
to
the
pats
whilst
drinking
this
brew
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
much
darker
than
i
thought
had
been
drinking
right
from
the
bottle
so
i
didnt
realize
this
malty
sweet
aroma
ok
taste
not
much
there
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
porter
i
made
easy
drinking
but
not
much
to
it
serving
type
bottle
meh
its
drinkable
though
its
not
a
spectacular
beer
not
as
flavorful
as
yuengling
traditional
which
i
prefer
nice
color
nice
head
the
phrase
drinkable
comes
to
mind
though
cliche
in
the
sense
that
this
stuff
actually
has
some
flavor
isnt
too
light
and
isnt
too
bready
in
the
area
of
being
good
but
not
great
its
even
more
yuengling
than
yuengling
traditional
full
of
sodium
skunky
and
lack
of
any
true
porter
character
i
drink
this
one
a
bunch
combo
of
their
porter
and
their
premium
which
is
a
misnomer
because
its
their
low
end
beer
mixes
well
howevertypical
black
and
tanthat
mixes
a
dark
with
a
adjunct
meh
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
carbonation
the
smell
was
very
subtle
although
i
did
get
some
toast
the
taste
was
mellow
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
noticeable
flavors
mostly
just
a
little
bit
of
toasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
also
way
too
thin
for
the
style
for
me
i
drank
this
one
time
and
that
night
my
body
was
sore
i
had
aches
on
my
muscles
it
was
the
strangest
thing
it
felt
like
i
worked
out
and
my
body
was
exhausted
that
cant
be
good
since
ive
never
gotten
that
feeling
from
any
other
beer
a
decent
take
on
a
black
and
tan
a
little
smoother
than
the
porter
but
still
very
tasty
before
i
understood
craft
beer
this
was
my
special
beer
funny
how
things
change
overall
an
average
to
slightly
below
average
black
and
tan
since
yuengling
has
been
reintroduced
to
massachusetts
i
have
been
thinking
there
beers
have
been
better
than
i
remember
them
being
that
is
not
the
case
unfortunately
with
this
one
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
one
that
does
not
stick
out
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
would
not
pick
it
up
either
overall
i
liked
this
a
bit
more
than
the
hefeweizen
i
had
but
only
since
i
had
lower
standards
its
a
very
drinkable
black
and
tan
o
nice
offering
from
yuengling
good
if
youre
looking
for
a
tasty
affordable
beer
thats
a
little
different
than
most
of
your
widely
available
affordable
beers
overy
good
delicious
beer
much
better
than
it
looked
easy
to
drink
i
could
chug
this
theres
just
not
much
depth
to
it
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
tastes
like
yuenglings
flagship
beer
mixed
with
a
porter
the
dark
half
of
the
beer
actually
seems
to
open
up
a
bit
with
warming
but
never
overcomes
the
feeling
of
being
watered
down
with
neutral
lager
the
final
product
is
decent
but
nothing
i
would
have
again
with
better
black
and
tans
being
made
locally
pours
a
burnt
amber
color
a
tan
head
the
head
is
dissipating
rapidly
and
now
its
gone
smell
is
fruity
almost
like
raspberries
taste
is
slightly
smokey
and
a
little
roast
and
malt
just
a
hint
of
caramel
thank
god
that
fruity
smell
has
worn
off
but
i
do
pick
it
up
a
little
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
a
thin
and
fizzy
picked
up
some
yuengling
black
and
tan
since
its
new
to
massachusetts
ive
had
their
flagship
beer
before
and
it
was
ok
was
not
very
impressed
with
this
poured
well
but
had
a
very
light
smell
upon
drinking
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
had
come
down
with
a
cold
because
i
didnt
taste
much
its
very
lightbodied
with
only
hints
of
hops
and
the
roasted
flavor
i
would
expect
didnt
taste
any
of
the
caramel
the
label
promised
over
all
not
an
awful
beer
but
definitely
not
a
great
beer
either
yuengling
original
black
and
tan
for
starters
its
very
good
let
me
tell
you
what
if
you
do
not
like
well
theres
nothing
i
can
do
so
enjoy
that
shit
its
not
heavy
to
heavy
per
say
this
beer
is
smooth
bottles
never
cans
and
always
draft
if
u
you
can
yuengling
black
tan
brewed
by
yuengling
this
brew
pours
out
a
dark
brown
almost
like
black
coffee
also
has
a
light
brown
head
on
top
the
smell
is
rich
with
flavor
there
is
nothing
bad
about
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
good
nothing
bad
real
smooth
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
to
brew
but
it
is
not
over
powering
clean
smooth
finish
nothing
bad
at
all
im
not
really
a
big
fan
of
dark
beers
but
this
one
i
like
im
more
of
american
style
lager
kind
of
person
but
this
porter
is
just
right
overall
its
ok
but
you
definitely
can
take
a
pass
on
this
one
i
guess
if
you
were
a
bud
drinker
this
may
be
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
for
you
anywayyuengling
bt
is

cheers

peace2all
overall
pretty
good
beer
one
of
the
better
black
and
tans
that
ive
had
and
worth
having
again
overall
a
decent
session
beer
if
you
dont
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
and
live
somewhere
in
pennsylvania
i
like
the
cans
personally
i
think
they
are
less
likely
to
taste
skunked
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
black
tans
that
has
crossed
my
palate
i
look
for
yuengling
in
the
places
i
can
find
it
and
typically
look
for
this
style
smooth
for
a
dark
beer
with
the
elements
of
dark
malts
and
bitter
hops
there
is
also
a
pleasant
aftertaste
which
aids
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
beer
i
remember
when
i
used
to
think
highly
of
yuenglings
black
tan
now
i
simply
question
my
judgement
as
a
younger
beer
drinker
among
other
things
while
it
pours
thick
and
presentable
it
drinks
thin
and
forgettable
with
little
to
no
hops
and
a
lack
of
roasted
flavors
it
tastes
comparable
to
a
straight
forward
low
abv
watered
down
and
dont
forget
flat
lager
the
hints
of
caramel
and
coffee
mentioned
on
the
label
well
those
ingredients
didnt
make
it
into
the
batch
i
received
long
story
short
dont
drink
a
traditional
layered
beer
from
a
12oz
bottle
it
will
always
end
in
disappointment
d
first
night
of
yuengling
in
ohio
last
night
of
this
snifter
intact
i
sure
hope
i
didnt
swallow
any
glass
the
bottle
pours
out
the
blackest
of
black
liquid
i
have
ever
seen
very
nice
in
my
opinion
its
aroma
is
a
nice
mixture
of
hops
and
caramel
where
i
do
taste
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
nothing
bad
mind
you
but
unfortunately
no
caramel
its
highly
carbonated
but
swishes
around
good
overall
its
rich
its
bold
and
definitely
refreshing
at
the
beach
im
glad
i
still
have
a
few
to
go
through
in
the
fridge
o
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
someone
looking
for
something
a
little
darker
than
your
average
bcm
product
nice
warm
weather
dark
thin
enough
to
quench
but
with
a
little
extra
flavor
the
price
point
on
this
is
ridiculously
low
im
always
impressed
when
a
cheap
beer
sticks
out
from
crowd
even
if
its
still
one
dimensional
solid
brew
if
you
keep
some
perspective
of
what
its
meant
to
be
a
nonoffensive
dark
for
the
populace
overall
this
beer
is
probably
an
intermediate
step
into
darker
more
fullbodied
dark
beers
i
find
it
very
affordable
and
extremely
drinkable
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
of
this
type
i
have
found
it
this
week
for
just
under
20
never
has
good
flavor
been
this
affordable
overall
unimpressed
pretty
lame
beer
all
around
this
didnt
really
have
anything
going
for
it
this
is
pretty
standard
beer
absolutely
nothing
offensive
about
this
but
really
nothing

those

by
the

the

and
it
just
aint
the
same
in
the
us
as
it
is
in
blighty
beer
biscuits
too
overall
for
the
price
this
one
is
tough
to
beat
provides
a
bit
more
flavor
than
your
standard
cheap
beer
always
find
myself
coming
back
to
this
one
yuengling
has
pulled
through
yet
again
first
off
drink
this
beer
out
of
a
glass
rather
than
a
can
or
bottle
the
pour
is
great
the
beer
is
darker
than
i
had
expected
and
holds
a
nice
head
after
pouring
this
beer
smells
similar
to
the
yuengling
lager
but
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
yuengling
porter
only
milder
i
enjoy
the
porters
flavor
but
it
is
too
strong
for
my
preferences
the
black
tan
is
more
mellow
while
still
having
that
roasted
malt
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavier
than
the
yuengling
lager
but
is
still
very
drinkable
overall
i
give
this
beer
slightly
under
a
4
for
22
bucks
a
case
its
a
great
beer
good
microbrew
type
flavor
at
a
very
reasonable
price
12
oz
bottle
pours
brown
with
short
lived
beige
head
nose
is
of
bready
malt
ripe
fruit
and
lemonade
body
is
medium
smooth
and
astringent
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
chalk
metallic
very
astringent
finish
is
long
and
astringent
at
least
i
did
not
buy
this
crap
got
a
sixer
cause
i
thought
it
was
time
to
give
it
a
try
wont
do
that
again
expected
a
little
more
from
yuengling
drank
from
a
bottle
so
not
gonna
comment
on
appearance
the
taste
was
a
little
bland
thought
there
would
be
more
complexity
finish
was
ok
about
the
only
part
of
it
that
i
enjoyed
got
less
than
i
paid
for
o
just
not
very
good
overly
sweet
lacking
substance
too
much
adjunct
lager
not
nearly
enough
porter
not
worth
a
second
look
overall
soso
about
on
par
with
yuengling
offerings
taste
is
surprising
dry
and
crisp
you
get
some
relaxed
sweet
notes
but
mostly
on
the
dry
bitter
side
of
things
the
feel
is
light
and
very
easy
to
drink
one
could
put
down
several
of
these
and
still
function
this
beer
sits
right
in
the
middle
of
bad
and
good
i
havent
had
the
porter
by
its
self
however
i
have
had
their
lager
and
it
is
much
better
then
this
mix
12
pack
for
10
where
i
shop
best
beer
i
have
found
at
that
price
shouldnt
be
compared
to
craft
beers
provides
a
beer
with
substance
for
people
who
cant
afford
more
than
a
dollar
beer
thanks
yuengling
for
christmas
ill
get
bells
founders
anchor
a
decent
beer
pretty
sort
of
sour
that
is
the
only
thing
i
really
dont
like
about
it
the
yuengling
porter
on
its
own
is
good
so
maybe
its
the
premium
beer
that
gives
it
the
sour
taste
the
saying
you
get
what
you
pay
for
comes
to
mind
a
nice
beer
to
grab
if
you
want
something
cheap
and
dark
and
cheap
dark
beer
is
hard
to
come
by
so
this
automatically
gets
a
goto
badge
cheap
dark
beer
category
a
decent
popular
brew
despite
the
lack
of
flavor
overallnot
a
bad
beer
nothing
really
special
ill
have
no
problem
drinking
the
six
pack
think
ill
stick
to
yuenglings
traditional
lager
next
time
would
i
buy
this
again
yes
and
no
i
dont
hate
it
or
even
dislike
it
but
im
not
impressed
by
it
for
a
massproduced
beer
aimed
at
being
somewhat
fancy
or
craftbeerlike
it
serves
its
purpose
i
do
not
feel
however
that
this
beer
is
worth
paying
nearly
fifteen
bucks
for
a
twelve
pack
this
pours
a
ruby
amber
color
with
cocoa
colored
foam
the
aroma
has
a
malty
caramel
tinge
to
it
theres
a
malty
flavor
to
it
on
the
sweeter
side
which
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
its
perfectly
acceptable
i
have
only
enjoyed
it
in
a
bottle
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
it
had
a
pleasant
aroma
upon
opening
but
a
less
than
average
head
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
liked
the
flavor
enough
though
it
lacked
a
bit
of
body
i
realize
that
yuengling
may
not
be
as
bold
in
flavor
as
some
of
the
other
beers
here
but
as
far
as
middle
of
the
road
brews
go
i
think
it
does
quite
well
it
is
smooth
and
palatable
without
being
overpowering
so
i
can
enjoy
it
with
a
meal
without
being
bloated
for
what
its
worth
mixing
their
porter
and
lager
about
4060
is
decent
im
inflating
the
overall
rating
for
that
reason
o
it
is
what
it
is
i
would
drink
another
taste
is
sweet
and
rich
yet
light
on
the
palate
oddly
refreshing
for
such
a
dark
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
not
in
a
bad
way
very
nice
beer
from
yuengling
pours
dark
brown
with
a
redish
tinge
it
has
a
tan
head
lasts
about
30
seconds
with
poor
lacing
very
light
aromas
of
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
a
vegetative
quality
heavy
carbonation
with
a
light
mouthfeel
the
flavors
are
even
lighter
than
the
smell
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
in
my
opinion
its
a
lighter
beer
than
it
lets
on
its
a
good
middle
of
the
road
easy
drinking
easytoget
beer
for
the
price
there
isnt
a
better
black
and
tan
going
the
16oz
cans
are
nice
too
the
pours
a
really
dark
just
like
the
porter
a
little
less
thick
but
equally
dark
hersheys
brown
with
a
small
off
white
head
lastign
just
seconds
smells
chocolatey
i
think
much
more
porter
in
this
blend
than
5050
at
least
thats
what
the
nose
tells
me
with
all
that
dark
roasty
malt
the
flavor
is
also
favoring
porter
but
its
lighter
in
feel
and
there
is
a
paler
malt
profile
the
the
look
or
the
smell
give
away
a
little
dark
cocoa
a
little
burnt
toast
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
finish
on
it
smooth
feel
maybe
a
touch
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
the
body
is
medium
as
it
should
be
and
its
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
especially
in
the
fall
far
far
superior
to
the
regular
yuengling
lager
so
this
is
another
one
of
those
beers
that
is
a
get
what
you
pay
for
kind
of
thing
not
a
craft
beer
but
better
than
a
bud
or
budtype
product
i
like
this
one
the
best
of
all
the
yuengling
flavors
i
have
tasted
so
far
this
is
a
good
goto
beer
for
parties
bargain
hunters
or
people
that
may
be
upgrading
from
bud
light
this
brew
poured
with
a
seriously
thick
tan
head
about
two
fingers
worth
that
dissipated
slowly
and
left
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
body
was
a
dark
brown
with
no
visible
carbonation
due
to
the
color
the
nose
presented
with
mostly
roasted
malts
grain
and
then
a
hint
of
coffee
smelled
good
to
me
the
beginning
of
the
sip
hit
me
with
mild
coffee
up
front
and
then
roasted
malts
came
through
some
sweetness
and
bread
also
came
through
on
the
subsequent
sips
the
sweetness
mostly
manifested
as
brown
sugar
but
was
altogether
mild
the
body
was
a
medium
thickness
with
middle
of
the
road
carbonation
the
finish
was
relatively
long
with
the
roasted
malts
apparent
in
the
taste
it
was
an
easy
drinker
with
some
flavor
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
i
think
the
style
is
generally
towards
the
boring
side
but
this
one
was
probably
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
had
add
to
the
fact
that
this
beer
tends
to
be
cheapworth
a
sip
overall
it
has
a
promising
scent
but
doesnt
really
deliver
taste
wise
it
smells
like
a
porter
but
basically
tastes
like
a
lager
still
an
easy
drinking
and
non
offensive
brew
overall
a
decent
average
beer
if
i
were
drinking
it
from
a
tap
where
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
getting
i
would
get
excited
by
the
color
then
disappointed
from
there
on
out
priceavailability
is
a
semi
redeeming
quality
where
its
plentiful
its
a
safe
choice
where
yuengling
is
a
rarity
i
would
probably
stick
to
regular
and
let
the
novelty
guide
my
tastebuds
for
the
price
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
good
to
have
around
for
parties
or
if
you
cant
afford
whatever
you
usually
drink
o
overall
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
always
will
be
the
look
and
the
taste
is
what
makes
me
really
love
this
beer
and
its
definitely
a
plus
that
its
brewed
by
the
oldest
brewery
in
america
definitely
my
second
favorite
next
to
guinness
extra
stout
o
not
a
great
black
tan
considering
the
parts
that
went
into
making
it
yuenglings
pale
lager
and
subpar
porter
i
see
this
as
a
novelty
beer
and
would
almost
want
to
drink
either
their
straight
porter
or
simply
the
amber
lager
yeah
this
is
especially
boring
especially
for
a
dark
beer
it
takes
no
risks
and
tastes
a
little
mass
produced
the
appearance
is
average
nice
color
and
an
ok
head
smells
like
an
average
not
bold
dark
lager
taste
is
watered
down
a
little
malty
and
a
little
citrusy
and
a
little
hoppy
everything
about
the
taste
is
just
not
bold
too
carbonated
and
not
very
creamy
this
beer
needs
help
its
not
terrible
but
i
expected
more
its
not
even
as
good
as
a
normal
yuengling
which
is
also
not
bold
and
a
little
boring
oh
well
o
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
definitely
rate
it
above
average
and
have
no
problem
drinking
more
of
these
in
the
future
o
i
liked
it
for
the
price
it
is
amazing
i
prefer
yuenglings
lager
though
i
would
also
choose
michelob
amberbock
over
this
for
the
factt
hat
it
is
so
similar
but
this
has
a
bit
less
bite
and
if
im
getting
this
kind
of
beer
i
want
more
than
just
a
slightly
roasted
lager
but
overal
a
good
beer
that
i
will
have
again
drink
its
okay
i
prefer
an
ipa
and
stout
combo
its
above
average
i
tried
to
stay
openminded
with
it
but
the
bt
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
microbrewed
craft
beer
but
it
gets
the
job
done
and
the
price
point
is
great
do
certainly
a
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
can
easily
have
45
on
a
given
saturday
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
itll
do
certainly
in
a
pinch
when
options
are
limited
im
not
crazy
about
the
idea
of
packaged
black
and
tans
but
im
thankful
that
my
dad
brought
this
back
from
vacation
for
me
its
much
like
a
watered
down
porter
making
me
think
that
yuenglings
porter
straight
must
be
a
bit
better
a
very
flavorful
cheap
beer
with
lager
and
porter
notes
would
but
in
a
pinch
or
to
introduce
someone
to
porters
my
first
black
and
tan
out
of
a
bottle
and
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
overall
pretty
bland
and
unspectacular
i
would
not
seek
this
out
to
buy
this
is
an
easy
barstool
beer
that
could
make
up
a
session
while
watching
football
and
eating
wings
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
black
appearance
short
and
bubbly
light
tan
colored
head
with
weak
retention
cream
milk
chocolate
roasted
malt
rye
spices
and
roasted
coffee
on
the
aroma
first
sip
is
a
moderately
carbonated
heavy
cream
flavor
with
light
notes
of
milk
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
rye
bread
turns
into
a
flat
roasted
nut
flavor
with
an
even
flatter
aftertaste
oddly
light
body
awkward
overall
flavor
yuengling
lager
is
so
delicious
i
was
definitely
expecting
greatness
with
this
black
tan
sad
to
say
i
didnt
get
it
overall
yuengling
always
offers
a
good
bang
for
the
buck
they
deliver
again
with
the
black
and
tan
it
has
some
nice
roasty
and
sweet
flavors
and
aromas
at
a
very
good
price
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
either
easy
of
enough
to
drink
and
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
but
im
not
certain
i
would
choose
as
a
session
beer
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
of
the
beer
are
slightly
muddled
o
ok
cheap
so
it
gets
the
job
done
not
stellar
stick
with
yuengling
lager
if
youre
going
to
buy
yuengling
overall
this
beer
is
not
very
good
at
all
but
i
used
to
buy
and
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
because
for
the
price
the
case
of
pounders
is
a
good
deal
it
is
pretty
hohum
though
and
not
much
better
than
any
macro
lager
there
is
just
a
touch
more
flavor
than
standard
macro
beers
being
a
pennsylvanian
and
given
that
people
around
here
really
appreciate
yuengers
i
still
have
a
place
in
my
heart
for
yuengling
overall
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
fan
of
the
genre
this
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
not
at
all
exciting
the
carbonation
didnt
make
a
whole
lot
of
itself
and
the
whole
experience
was
rather
nondescript
d
one
was
good
enough
to
try
review
from
notes
pours
a
dark
cola
like
color
into
pint
glass
with
a
small
quarter
inch
tan
head
on
it
smell
is
a
mix
of
stale
lager
and
dull
malt
and
taste
wise
much
of
the
same
kinda
what
i
expected
it
tastes
like
a
literal
mix
of
their
lager
and
porter
combined
and
frankly
id
reach
for
either
of
those
before
another
sixer
of
this
overall
its
average
and
finishes
clean
and
the
price
is
right
as
always
for
yuengling
product
honestly
black
and
tans
are
best
made
and
served
by
the
drinker
a
brewed
version
that
combines
the
2
perfectly
i
have
yet
to
encounter
its
a
balance
that
is
best
left
to
the
drinker
much
like
adding
salt
or
pepper
to
a
dish
everyones
palate
is
a
little
different
ill
stick
to
their
porter
d
with
low
abv
and
lightish
flavor
profile
it
would
be
pretty
easy
to
down
quite
a
few
of
these
overall
nothing
to
see
here
move
on
you
have
better
luck
mixing
your
own
and
having
more
fun
at
least
it
would
look
like
a
black
and
tan
but
this
just
comes
off
as
a
real
dumbed
down
porter
overall
im
usually
a
fan
of
darker
beers
but
this
one
was
a
little
off
the
aftertaste
was
bitter
and
unpleasant
not
as
smooth
as
their
lager
overall
if
you
have
to
decide
stick
with
the
porter
though
the
black
tan
is
unique
in
pennsylvania
overall
not
bad
a
good
social
beer
and
depending
on
where
you
buy
it
the
price
isnt
bad
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
definitely
has
drinkability
on
its
side
the
body
allows
this
beer
to
be
drank
in
big
swigs
and
never
becomes
coating
or
sticky
the
carbonation
is
not
immediately
noticeable
but
is
undoubtedly
doing
a
lot
of
work
in
the
background
o
of
what
is
available
currently
in
ohio
this
is
easily
the
brewerys
best
that
said
this
has
no
real
bearing
on
the
score
of
any
particular
beers
review
there
are
few
commercial
examples
to
compare
this
to
but
the
best
i
have
yet
had
isnt
even
in
the
same
league
as
this
beer
that
is
to
say
that
this
beer
is
not
enough
to
consider
yuengling
as
a
craft
brewery
and
that
beer
is
hoppin
frogs
black
and
tan
then
again
how
many
beers
of
any
style
can
compete
with
something
that
is
half
boris
the
crusher
pretty
basic
offering
from
americas
oldest
brewery
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
rootbeer
color
with
inadequate
head
and
lacing
yes
it
has
an
aroma
light
roasted
malts
a
little
bacon
perhaps
taste
is
american
light
beer
with
a
smidgeon
of
roasted
dark
malts
and
coffee
very
thin
mouthfeel
without
much
finish
better
than
bmc
but
essentially
a
variant
of
american
megalager
swill
i
certainly
wont
come
back
to
this
one
but
i
suppose
there
are
worse
beers
i
cant
really
name
any
off
the
top
of
my
head
though
12
ounce
bottle
bought
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
pack
at
a
local
kroger
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
redbrown
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
about
an
inch
light
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
average
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
the
brew
smells
like
sweet
roasted
and
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
coffee
the
brew
tastes
like
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
toffee
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
with
good
carbonation
its
also
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
what
it
is
its
a
decent
enough
brew
yuengling
says
this
is
a
mix
of
their
porter
and
premium
beer
its
worth
trying
and
i
might
buy
this
occasionally
in
the
future
o
a
black
and
tan
that
is
mixed
and
bottled
is
a
far
cry
from
one
poured
fresh
from
a
tap
its
easy
to
drink
overall
its
not
bad
its
a
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
yuengling
lineup
its
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
unoffensive
and
decent
decent
brew
overall
flavors
are
light
but
still
tasted
good
very
drinkable
though
i
felt
this
was
a
good
beer
and
am
happy
to
find
it
at
my
local
restaurants
and
pubs
o
nothing
complex
but
an
easydrinking
affordable
and
pleasant
beer
overall
drinkable
and
worth
a
repeat
an
interesting
idea
that
doesnt
quite
come
through
not
as
good
as
a
straightup
porter
or
light
ale
or
lager
i
was
quite
surprised
with
this
beer
i
did
not
expect
much
but
ended
up
being
pleasantly
surprised
first
time
was
out
of
a
bottle
the
other
night
the
head
was
foamy
the
beer
was
smooth
it
actually
had
a
very
good
flavor
to
it
quite
dark
in
appearance
as
the
name
implies
but
taste
is
not
overbearing
i
was
definitely
sold
i
respect
yuengling
for
their
history
but
there
are
better
choices
o
this
is
was
just
an
okay
black
and
tan
nothing
really
special
but
it
was
easily
drinkable
tastedark
toasted
malt
weak
coffee
note
thinbodied
but
a
bit
more
character
than
the
regular
lager
a
sessionable
brew
but
nothing
special
here
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
money
and
is
a
nice
changeup
from
the
usual
adjunct
lagers
not
spectacular
though
d
drinks
more
like
an
english
style
porter
than
a
blend
but
i
suppose
a
darker
beer
should
take
over
in
this
blend
the
body
is
a
real
turnoff
for
me
otherwise
manageable
d
not
bad
if
its
whats
being
served
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
looking
for
this
its
become
my
cheap
goto
lately
while
being
laid
up
with
old
army
injuries
so
my
wife
has
been
able
to
grab
a
12pack
for
me
but
overall
its
nearly
macro
in
quality
only
reason
that
most
people
from
nepa
enjoy
this
one
is
because
it
was
a
beer
everyone
grew
upwere
raised
on
living
40
miles
from
yuengling
brewery
in
the
pa
coal
region
i
know
this
first
hand
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
price
something
worth
keeping
in
the
fridge
overall
id
say
i
wish
we
could
get
this
at
liquor
stores
here
might
be
a
good
alternative
to
darker
ales
like
newcastle
to
switch
things
up
a
bit
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sessionable
beers
that
is
easy
to
put
down
and
overall
pretty
tasty
for
what
it
is
and
the
price
of
course
we
cant
get
it
here
in
mississippi
but
its
something
that
i
enjoy
anytime
im
back
on
the
east
coast
or
family
comes
to
visit
wonderful
beer
for
the
weekend
o
a
decent
beer
especially
considering
the
price
much
better
than
other
black
and
tan
blends
i
have
had
if
they
distributed
this
in
michigan
id
have
a
new
session
beer
a
decent
black
and
tan
but
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
looking
for
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
edges
fine
tan
head
faint
scent
of
hops
and
malts
taste
is
acrid
and
nutty
lager
has
some
bite
carbonationwise
not
much
taste
acrid
finish
drinkability
was
not
that
high
o
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
aside
from
the
closed
aroma
an
easy
drinking
black
and
tan
while
not
my
favorite
style
this
is
one
that
i
could
drink
easy
enough
especially
from
the
can
at
some
sort
of
bbq
or
tailgate
7
00
for
a
6pack
win
keep
in
mind
the
average
craft
beer
where
i
live
is
910
a
sixer
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
not
one
that
i
would
openly
drink
everyday
but
worth
it
occasionally
overall
pretty
good
beer
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
it
but
it
is
definitely
drinkable
not
too
bitter
not
to
sweet
which
i
like
it
just
didnt
wow
me
given
options
this
wouldnt
be
the
first
beer
id
buy
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
say
no
if
it
was
offered
pours
a
dark
brown
with
14
inch
of
soft
foamy
brownish
head
the
smell
has
notes
of
roasted
malts
and
faint
coffee
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
faint
coffee
and
faint
chocolate
theres
a
faint
bitter
hoppiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
little
highly
carbonated
and
at
times
a
little
thin
m
very
creamy
and
properly
carbonated
for
the
style
surmounted
my
expectations
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
enjoyable
the
quality
is
comparable
to
the
price
it
is
certainly
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
this
style
but
it
is
a
good
beer
nonetheless
great
for
parties
on
a
budget
plus
at
4
7
abv
nobody
should
end
up
too
blitzed
o
i
drink
several
of
these
at
a
time
not
something
terribly
complex
but
my
choice
when
it
comes
to
macros
pours
an
oil
slick
black
with
an
inch
of
creamy
deep
tan
head
reasonable
lacing
aroma
is
yeasty
with
some
nuts
and
malty
notes
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
taste
is
yeasty
malty
somewhat
nutty
a
hint
of
coffee
and
fairly
metallic
tasting
this
is
certainly
nothing
special
but
it
is
a
good
cheap
brew
that
i
could
sip
all
day
with
some
friends
overall
a
stepping
stone
to
the
really
burly
black
and
tans
smooth
and
sessionable
alone
or
with
burgers
or
bbq
perhaps
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
a
very
cool
beer
surprise
decent
drinkability
on
this
one
i
like
it
far
more
than
their
flagship
lager
some
complexity
but
still
fairly
simple
ok
beer
tasting
the
beer
i
was
slightly
disappointed
up
front
you
have
caramel
and
roasted
malt
in
the
middle
some
brown
sugar
and
at
the
end
maybe
those
hops
overall
the
taste
was
weak
and
flat
not
much
complexity
but
drinkable
purchased
a
six
pack
over
this
past
weekend
poured
into
a
glass
brew
has
a
deep
black
color
with
a
little
lacing
and
a
smooth
taste
that
was
somewhat
bitter
taste
had
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
and
coffee
not
a
bad
beer
overall
just
not
my
style
probably
a
better
beer
for
winter
time
with
soups
or
stews
not
a
summer
time
brew
the
best
beer
choice
in
a
dive
bar
in
alfred
ny
this
one
called
to
me
pours
a
solid
reddish
brown
with
a
thinnish
tan
head
smells
of
toffee
and
slight
earthy
hops
smells
like
someone
mixed
guinness
with
michelob
earthy
toffee
taste
slight
darker
grainy
taste
faint
hints
of
chocolate
are
a
nice
surprise
while
the
metallic
off
taste
isnt
spirited
carbonation
with
a
medium
thinnish
body
watery
chalky
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
if
i
had
to
but
wouldnt
seek
this
out
rjt
oa
decent
everyday
drinking
beer
at
a
great
price
im
unbiased
this
is
a
great
beer
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
overall
this
isnt
great
but
its
certainly
not
as
bad
as
a
lot
of
its
price
range
o
the
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
is
easy
to
drink
because
of
its
light
body
and
low
alcohol
content
overall
ehhh
not
disgusting
but
pretty
lousy
try
it
when
offered
but
dont
spend
money
on
it
i
remember
having
this
on
tap
and
it
was
a
little
better
o
d
this
is
kinda
bad
must
be
old
not
sure
what
i
expected
with
this
but
it
is
really
not
very
good
pours
a
fairly
pretty
dark
brown
with
a
good
amount
of
tan
head
looks
acceptable
but
not
stellar
smells
weird
roasted
coffee
and
some
light
dark
malts
with
atouch
of
hops
overall
not
that
good
on
the
nose
or
the
tongue
off
flavours
prevail
eith
some
strange
aftertaste
the
beer
itlf
isnt
horrible
but
lacks
anything
to
s
it
apart
overall
not
something
i
wold
seek
out
again
it
poured
a
stout
like
color
beer
with
a
brownish
foaming
head
it
smelled
of
slight
chocolate
with
smoke
notes
i
tasted
some
banana
aromas
and
bitter
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
finish
remind
me
of
guiness
extra
stout
which
is
a
average
beer
overall
a
good
bargain
beer
while
i
prefer
it
to
the
traditional
lager
the
plain
porter
is
better
o
as
far
as
premixed
black
and
tans
go
it
exceeded
my
expectations
overall
a
beer
i
often
choose
when
looking
to
not
spend
much
money
on
booze
the
flavor
is
satisfying
and
at
almost
every
bar
in
maryland
it
has
that
dark
beer
taste
but
with
the
refreshing
end
of
an
ale
a
good
drink
for
relaxing
with
in
the
early
summer
months
i
have
gotten
many
times
and
will
get
it
many
times
again
o
not
the
most
drinkable
this
doesnt
do
much
of
anything
for
me
i
would
drink
this
again
if
offered
one
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
with
some
nice
light
flavor
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
this
beer
is
brown
to
light
black
with
some
garnet
hues
throughout
it
had
three
fingers
of
beige
head
with
no
retention
and
a
few
wisps
of
sticky
lacing
the
smell
is
any
thing
but
impressive
harsh
and
chemical
like
smelled
a
little
of
bile
had
some
coffee
cocoa
and
smoky
molasses
flavors
but
they
feel
thin
and
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
forgetful
overall
this
beer
is
just
not
unremarkable
its
artificial
sweetness
bookended
by
flavorless
swill
overall
better
than
i
expected
its
not
particularly
strong
or
hoppy
but
its
a
nice
smooth
crisp
black
and
tan
drink
a
touch
bitter
to
start
decent
carbonation
id
had
one
at
room
temp
before
i
think
had
more
scent
and
flavor
but
this
was
no
less
than
50
degrees
so
it
shouldnt
be
that
hidden
o
i
was
surprised
how
drinkable
this
beer
was
and
by
that
i
mean
how
much
i
want
to
drink
it
i
was
skeptical
before
i
tried
this
one
as
i
usually
only
like
black
and
tan
that
i
create
but
for
what
this
was
it
was
a
simple
no
frills
mixture
that
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
thanks
again
woody
for
hooking
it
up
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
two
finger
head
that
was
tan
and
fluffy
smells
of
roasted
sweet
malts
light
bitter
coffee
and
slight
chocolate
tasted
like
roasted
malts
and
coffee
with
slight
chocolate
and
vanilla
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
overall
not
the
best
black
n
tan
but
not
the
worst
either
i
would
drink
it
again
brought
in
a
chilled
not
frosted
mug
head
was
almost
two
fingers
of
soft
white
foam
which
left
little
lace
color
matched
a
30
on
my
pocket
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
was
that
of
roasted
coffee
roasted
wheat
molasses
sweet
corn
and
malt
the
taste
was
a
little
less
harsh
but
still
had
the
flavors
of
rich
black
coffee
burnt
wheat
molasses
coco
corn
and
malt
mouthfeel
was
bold
but
lacking
in
body
and
smoothness
seems
to
be
missing
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
one
of
my
favorite
tasting
beer
but
it
is
a
good
change
from
the
bmc
that
most
offer
on
tap
overall
this
beer
is
ok
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
from
such
a
classic
brewery
that
i
cant
get
out
here
on
the
west
coast
that
being
said
i
would
take
a
guinness
black
and
tan
over
this
one
any
day
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
amber
highlights
it
smells
like
a
flat
porter
or
dry
stout
it
has
a
light
roast
aspect
slight
bitterness
and
subtle
malty
sweetness
its
pretty
standard
the
taste
isnt
too
shabby
though
its
like
a
like
porter
and
easy
to
drink
it
has
the
light
roast
and
malt
combining
to
give
it
enough
flavor
the
light
coffee
and
malty
sweetness
do
their
part
it
is
a
little
light
in
body
for
the
style
but
its
actually
pretty
smooth
it
actually
went
really
well
with
my
grouper
its
an
ok
black
and
tan
but
pretty
good
considering
its
probably
the
cheapest
one
around
in
a
six
pack
not
too
shabby
o
this
has
decent
drinkability
the
flavor
is
alright
and
it
goes
down
easy
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
that
ive
had
and
i
thought
it
was
alright
i
would
try
this
one
again
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
it
i
hated
the
black
tan
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
thought
it
was
horrible
on
every
level
im
not
sure
what
made
me
try
it
again
but
it
was
surprisingly
much
better
the
second
time
around
the
pour
of
this
beer
is
a
deep
brown
nearly
black
with
a
tan
head
the
aromas
are
a
mix
of
hops
and
burnt
charcoal
the
taste
is
very
toasted
toasted
heavily
to
say
the
least
the
mouthfeel
is
bitey
and
carbonated
pretty
good
stuff
frothy
tan
one
inch
head
amber
brown
body
with
ruby
highlights
roasted
malt
aroma
lightly
bitter
taste
not
as
much
taste
as
expected
almost
like
a
light
lager
mouthfeel
was
watery
lightly
fizzy
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
outstanding
either
12oz
bottle
pours
a
super
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
ruby
hues
and
a
half
inch
of
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
grains
some
coffee
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
taste
is
malty
lots
of
roasted
malt
flavor
along
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
very
small
amount
of
coffee
it
is
a
good
attempt
at
putting
a
black
and
tan
in
1
bottle
but
obviously
doesnt
quite
deliver
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
overall
there
isnt
many
black
and
tans
beers
out
there
and
this
one
is
worth
grabbing
overall
id
rather
just
drink
yuengling
porter
and
leave
this
one
of
the
shelf
notes
overall
its
easy
to
drink
with
no
off
flavors
but
a
little
boring
and
very
average
o
this
is
a
little
less
than
average
imo
the
metallic
taste
kind
of
puts
this
off
for
me
would
not
have
this
again
as
a
choice
unless
everything
else
was
somehow
worse
would
seek
out
in
a
dive
bar
i
guess
you
could
say
personally
i
think
i
will
just
stick
with
the
base
beers
mixing
them
together
creates
somewhat
of
a
dissonance
that
i
did
not
enjoy
notes
yuengling
makes
good
use
of
its
less
stellar
premium
brew
as
the
tan
matched
up
with
their
better
than
decent
porter
actually
a
lager
i
really
enjoy
this
ontap
in
some
respects
it
reminds
me
of
sierra
nevada
stout
and
i
have
no
complaints
about
it
being
poured
into
a
glass
from
a
tall
boy
can
pint
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
try
if
you
have
been
intimidated
by
dark
beers
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
just
not
anything
special
a
good
representation
of
the
style
being
that
it
is
about
halfway
between
a
light
beer
and
a
dark
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
kind
of
an
earthy
musty
smell
it
neither
entralls
me
nor
does
it
repulse
me
its
kind
of
ho
hum
taste
like
a
watered
down
porter
faint
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
a
bit
too
thin
its
drinkable
something
to
go
after
if
you
are
looking
for
a
lighter
bodied
dark
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
brown
head
smells
of
coffee
beans
and
roasted
malts
tastes
a
bit
bitter
at
first
but
finishes
with
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
very
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
and
little
carbonation
not
exceptional
but
a
refreshing
beer
i
remember
the
taste
being
more
delicious
in
the
past
im
thinking
if
i
reviewed
this
when
i
first
started
rating
beers
it
would
have
a
much
higher
rating
my
palate
has
changed
quite
a
bit
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
fingerwidth
head
that
fades
slowly
there
is
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
smell
as
well
as
roasted
malt
in
a
way
the
beer
starts
like
a
lager
and
finishes
like
a
porter
hops
can
be
tasted
but
are
mostly
in
the
background
a
toasty
finish
suggests
the
source
of
the
dark
part
of
the
beer
some
corn
is
noted
as
well
in
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
and
medium
bodied
overall
dark
mahogany
color
with
thick
creamy
tan
head
lots
of
carbonation
good
head
retention
malty
corny
aroma
grainy
with
a
bit
of
caramel
some
roasted
malt
taste
is
much
smoother
more
roasted
malt
and
caramel
but
still
a
lingering
grainycorny
characteristic
light
to
medium
body
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
ok
i
havent
had
a
black
and
tan
in
a
long
time
this
one
will
hold
me
over
for
another
few
years
the
flavor
isnt
awful
but
it
certainly
isnt
something
i
want
to
drink
an
astoundingly
good
dark
beer
for
the
price
10
bucks
for
a
12pack
at
wegmans
in
state
college
pa
i
found
my
new
standard
it
brings
some
of
the
unique
flavors
found
in
yuengling
porter
to
a
slightly
lighter
beer
but
make
no
mistake
the
stuff
is
not
weak
it
might
not
be
the
most
delicious
beer
on
the
planet
but
the
combination
of
good
flavor
and
low
price
are
unbeatable
for
me
as
a
beerenthusiast
college
student
not
a
drunkard
everyone
else
has
described
the
taste
well
enough
my
review
is
mainly
economic
d
could
drink
this
one
quite
awhile
on
a
cold
winter
night
very
drinkable
affordable
the
drinkability
is
good
as
far
as
im
concerned
for
the
cost
i
think
its
a
fairly
balanced
black
and
tan
not
too
heavy
and
doesnt
leave
a
very
strong
aftertaste
definitely
something
to
enjoy
in
warm
or
cold
weather
d
this
beer
was
a
nice
drinking
beer
overall
the
abv
was
low
enough
that
you
could
drink
these
all
night
the
overall
aroma
and
flavor
is
muted
but
average
at
best
now
when
i
have
6
bucks
to
my
name
this
beer
comes
first
much
rather
have
this
over
anything
i
can
get
for
the
price
i
can
get
this
at
not
a
bad
buy
but
def
not
the
best
undrinkable
d
better
than
average
drinkablity
make
this
one
a
session
beer
and
a
great
keg
beer
for
a
bbq
cheers
d
a
good
darker
beer
without
being
huge
like
a
ris
or
even
a
robust
porter
this
might
be
a
good
intro
to
darkerroastier
beers
for
someone
who
likes
brown
ales
but
is
afraid
of
a
porter
or
stout
not
bad
not
great
cant
believe
i
never
tried
this
when
i
lived
in
fl
drinkability
well
the
drinkability
is
very
good
seeing
how
thins
this
beer
is
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
very
refreshing
the
carbonation
and
slight
astringency
i
got
i
found
a
little
offsetting
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
so
many
better
out
there
though
d
this
is
what
it
is
its
a
great
beer
to
provide
or
serve
to
a
large
group
of
people
as
it
can
appeal
to
a
wide
range
of
tastes
but
theres
nothing
too
incredibly
special
about
it
ddefinitely
not
that
most
enjoyable
beer
but
ive
found
that
when
selections
are
low
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
classic
black
and
tans
with
guinness
and
harpbass
are
still
the
way
to
go
black
and
tan
pours
out
mostly
black
looking
resembling
a
cola
look
with
some
dark
reds
through
some
light
a
fairly
minimal
head
about
a
half
inch
up
looking
light
tan
and
wispy
nothing
on
the
glass
smell
is
a
fairly
roasted
scent
with
faint
vanilla
and
grain
out
the
wazoo
especially
with
warming
it
taste
exactly
the
same
but
maybe
not
in
that
order
funny
that
i
dont
pick
up
any
chocolate
at
all
this
is
not
a
sweet
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
besides
the
huge
grain
bill
this
remains
fairly
balanced
and
drinkable
and
simple
a
good
local
brew
for
when
your
in
the
mood
to
just
drink
verdict
pretty
average
nothing
i
would
get
again
but
nothing
i
seriously
regret
purchasing
one
bottle
of
this
is
one
of
the
most
commonly
available
black
and
tan
beers
on
the
market
so
consider
this
a
welcome
mat
to
that
style
i
wasnt
impressed
c
2
9
d
an
ok
beer
but
not
very
good
a
below
average
black
and
tan
wouldnt
seek
out
again
pours
near
black
with
a
fairly
thick
tan
head
head
is
quite
bubbly
and
leaves
some
pretty
good
lacing
the
nose
is
not
terribly
good
a
slight
bit
of
roast
and
maybe
mild
chocolate
the
flavor
is
a
bit
worse
than
that
tastes
like
someone
threw
a
bit
of
black
malt
into
a
regular
yuengling
feel
is
light
and
prickly
not
a
terribly
good
beer
and
i
will
say
that
i
was
expecting
more
when
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
had
a
very
dark
brown
color
to
it
with
not
a
lot
of
head
to
it
the
smell
is
of
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
not
much
else
but
a
mix
of
lager
and
a
porter
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
and
has
a
sweet
bitterness
to
it
not
much
else
to
say
this
one
has
a
decent
mouth
feel
and
is
not
one
the
best
one
i
have
tried
but
is
ok
d
meh
glad
to
get
to
try
this
but
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
quite
that
often
i
think
ill
continue
to
blend
my
own
black
and
tans
when
i
feel
like
it
decent
served
in
regular
pint
glass
this
is
dark
brown
with
little
light
percing
the
edges
smallish
head
and
teh
retention
of
the
head
is
weak
toasted
and
roasted
notes
come
to
mind
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
closer
to
a
porter
than
anything
else
it
reminds
me
of
their
lager
being
mixed
with
their
porter
and
this
is
what
you
get
body
is
medium
and
not
much
carbonation
its
decent
but
nothing
i
would
buy
from
a
store
just
a
good
alternative
to
macros
at
a
bar
overall
believe
it
or
not
this
is
my
first
black
and
tan
from
yuengling
and
ive
lived
in
pa
my
whole
life
while
nothing
earth
shattering
this
isnt
terrible
beer
or
even
bad
beer
for
that
matter
its
very
drinkable
it
has
some
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
and
is
super
approachable
for
anyone
for
the
price
you
cant
beat
it
thinner
medium
body
mild
carbonation
some
sticky
dryness
this
is
pretty
much
eh
from
top
to
bottom
and
the
adjunct
metallic
component
really
doesnt
help
im
usually
a
yuengling
fan
but
this
is
a
no
go
d
ok
for
this
style
drinkability
very
drinkable
great
example
of
the
style
bold
while
not
overly
intense
could
serve
to
have
a
slighter
abv
that
would
give
it
a
bit
more
character
pours
a
dark
brownishred
twofinger
tan
head
head
dissipates
leaving
slight
lacing
aroma
is
modest
mostly
similar
to
the
porter
with
faint
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
carbonation
is
medium
as
well
drinkability
is
pretty
high
since
i
dont
find
it
especially
filling
or
strong
i
think
that
the
black
and
tan
style
is
better
made
with
more
flavorful
beers
and
not
premixed
like
this
another
average
beer
from
yuengling
this
one
would
be
a
good
alternative
to
a
bmc
lager
for
me
but
i
wont
likely
buy
it
often
d
goes
down
rather
easily
mild
kick
ok
representation
of
style
this
isnt
a
beer
to
sit
down
and
really
aprreciate
but
to
just
kick
back
and
watch
the
game
i
could
sit
with
a
few
of
these
i
really
like
yuengling
bt
for
the
price
point
i
do
taste
an
english
style
ale
when
i
drink
it
and
the
stout
also
seems
solid
i
order
this
beer
when
the
big
three
are
otherwise
available
and
i
want
to
subject
myself
to
more
flavor
and
ridicule
in
other
words
this
beer
is
sometimes
available
when
more
obscure
craft
brews
may
not
be
so
it
is
nice
to
have
it
as
an
option
overall
pretty
good
beer
not
my
favorite
black
and
tan
but
isnt
too
damn
shabby
for
a
5
99
six
pack
at
your
local
grocery
store
cheers
color
is
a
cola
like
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
medium
khaki
colored
head
with
a
soft
pour
not
alot
of
lacing
the
nose
isnt
overly
impressive
the
pale
lager
smell
comes
through
the
most
followed
by
a
little
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
barley
palate
is
more
porter
than
pale
lager
the
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
is
showcased
in
the
front
and
finishes
clean
and
mild
like
a
lager
body
is
fluid
and
crisp
decent
drinkable
blend
at
a
good
price
i
really
like
the
flagship
from
this
brewery
now
time
to
try
a
rare
style
from
them
beer
pours
a
very
dark
red
color
not
much
head
to
it
faint
aroma
taste
is
medium
bodied
kind
of
a
subdued
flavor
to
it
and
nothing
really
stands
out
very
smooth
and
drinkable
none
the
less
but
just
a
bit
bland
to
me
definitely
a
beer
thats
smooth
and
easy
to
finish
but
i
feel
it
could
use
a
better
hop
kick
to
it
or
at
least
some
more
maltiness
flavorwise
kind
of
stuck
in
the
middle
meh
overall
okay
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
drinkability
i
would
drink
it
if
given
or
no
other
more
interesting
choices
were
available
not
really
one
i
would
go
searching
for
not
bad
but
not
good
enough
to
choose
when
others
are
available
d
yes
but
i
dont
particularly
want
to
drink
more
of
it
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
starts
with
a
hit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
then
sweetens
up
a
little
bit
and
shows
some
biscuity
malt
and
then
a
light
burst
of
lemon
hop
citrus
shows
itself
as
the
carbonation
becomes
more
noticeable
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
a
step
up
from
the
original
yuengling
lager
great
for
the
price
5
49
a
6er
this
beer
has
a
good
mouthfeel
has
a
good
lager
full
feeling
with
the
crispness
of
a
stout
finish
rather
well
blended
but
it
losses
too
much
good
sessionable
beer
would
go
well
with
spicy
bbq
has
a
decent
drinkability
d
very
good
clean
with
a
light
roastiness
and
dry
finish
pretty
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
12pz
bottle
i
think
it
cost
a
dollar
dark
black
color
decent
head
looks
good
smells
oddly
like
lager
and
then
some
toasty
porter
notes
the
taste
was
exactly
the
same
but
nothing
special
this
beer
actually
made
me
wish
i
had
just
the
yuengling
porter
this
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
great
average
overall
over
all
a
damn
good
beer
it
has
an
impressive
look
and
a
strong
n
not
bitter
taste
it
seems
to
lack
sustainability
to
temperature
though
after
5
minutes
or
so
it
has
lost
alot
of
flavor
and
chill
better
out
of
the
bottle
than
in
a
can
or
on
tap
has
some
thickness
and
a
pleasant
after
taste
d
easy
to
drink
in
my
opinion
though
keep
them
to
a
minimum
if
you
are
playing
chess
since
i
just
lost
a
game
online
while
writing
this
review
d
pretty
easy
drink
although
i
wouldnt
personally
want
more
than
a
couple
in
a
night
i
guess
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
d
easy
drinking
not
unsatisfying
not
the
tastiest
bt
but
not
bad
either
but
it
is
a
bottled
bt
viva
la
can
sorry
eagle
i
will
not
come
and
visit
you
ever
again
your
price
may
be
attractive
but
your
lone
barrel
sucks
bring
something
better
to
the
mountaintop
next
time
i
first
tried
this
beer
after
going
on
the
yuengling
brewery
tour
in
pottsville
pa
i
bought
a
six
pack
the
next
day
this
is
one
of
the
better
dark
beers
ive
had
when
poured
out
of
the
bottle
it
has
a
thick
foamy
head
that
dissolves
quickly
it
has
a
roasted
smell
like
bold
coffee
i
can
taste
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
it
is
not
too
bitter
or
too
carbonated
it
has
a
smooth
full
mouthfeel
it
is
easy
to
drink
two
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
two
in
one
sitting
dark
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
if
not
backlit
has
a
tannish
head
some
roasted
malt
little
chocolate
little
bit
of
hops
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
its
a
jack
of
all
trades
but
a
master
of
none
on
the
light
side
of
both
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
pretty
average
all
around
ill
take
this
only
over
bmcs
im
from
the
west
coast
so
yuengling
to
me
is
awesome
that
will
be
lame
to
you
hipster
types
but
i
like
these
guys
and
its
only
beer
this
beer
looks
and
smells
great
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
are
ok
just
average
but
the
drinkibility
of
this
and
every
yuengling
beer
is
great
seriously
these
guys
are
built
to
last
and
support
them
good
medium
alcohol
beer
that
has
some
flavor
overall
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
to
be
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
through
the
evening
but
one
that
sits
fairly
well
on
the
palate
a
good
dark
beer
alternative
that
is
pretty
light
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
nothing
special
but
far
from
bad
considering
the
price
and
decent
taste
this
isnt
a
bad
way
to
go
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
lot
of
toffee
the
flavor
is
toffee
earthy
hops
and
some
dirt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
very
good
but
not
as
bad
as
other
black
and
tans
i
have
tried
not
a
big
fan
of
black
and
tans
but
this
was
ok
woudl
not
seek
it
out
but
wouldnt
refuse
a
freebee
pours
black
with
a
quickly
fading
light
brown
head
minor
lacing
if
any
weak
aroma
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
some
hops
the
caramel
yuengling
malt
dominates
the
flavor
a
bit
of
roasted
chocolatecoffee
and
some
bitter
hops
as
well
nothing
too
strong
pretty
standard
flavor
profile
medium
bodied
d
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
more
mildly
interesting
a
quality
session
brew
i
wouldnt
hesitate
drinking
one
again
but
not
quite
sure
i
would
invest
in
a
sixer
anytime
soon
either
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
my
favorite
pairing
with
this
beer
is
a
good
pizza
definetly
worth
a
try
though
d
hard
to
say
really
slightly
on
the
expensive
side
so
unless
i
ever
see
it
on
tap
somewhere
i
doubt
ill
ever
buy
again
one
of
those
hey
never
seen
this
before
i
buy
it
and
then
im
not
that
impressed
however
points
for
trying
same
as
comparing
draft
to
bottle
having
a
mixed
beer
drink
is
going
to
be
different
in
a
bar
vs
bottled
overall
not
good
or
bad
in
my
opinion
just
mediocrity
one
of
my
goto
everyday
drink
beers
it
never
disappoints
dits
not
my
preference
but
hey
its
all
up
to
you
i
wouldnt
buy
it
but
if
you
wanna
give
it
to
me
for
free
hell
yeah
id
take
it
the
best
of
all
yuengling
beers
sister
and
brotherinlaw
bought
me
a
variety
pack
with
traditional
lager
light
lager
and
lord
chesterfield
ale
the
unusual
taste
made
me
want
more
and
more
only
wish
it
was
available
in
ohio
after
drinking
the
finest
of
the
finest
it
is
hard
to
drink
a
bud
or
miller
product
this
was
tough
to
drink
i
took
2
sips
and
wanted
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
i
think
the
premium
is
to
blame
i
may
try
the
old
recipe
of
porter
and
lord
chesterfield
on
my
own
it
couldnt
be
worse
very
drinkable
even
on
a
summer
night
i
still
prefer
the
porter
on
its
own
and
much
better
than
the
premium
on
its
own
drinkability
its
good
to
try
but
given
the
choice
between
the
two
stick
with
traditional
yuengling
lager
or
make
your
own
black
and
tan
the
way
they
were
meant
to
be
made
on
the
spot
not
mixed
beforehand
d
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
this
beer
it
esentially
took
a
good
porter
base
but
made
it
not
quite
right
the
mouthfeel
pulled
this
down
for
me
just
kind
of
an
average
beer
in
my
eyes
d
over
all
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
has
a
good
taste
thats
pretty
easy
to
drink
so
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
allinall
this
is
pretty
drinkable
the
brew
seems
to
lack
depth
and
just
continues
to
refuse
to
give
me
a
reason
to
come
back
to
it
more
than
a
few
times
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
when
i
poured
this
beer
i
poured
it
a
little
too
vigorously
resulting
in
a
huge
fluffy
off
white
head
looks
dark
but
not
stout
dark
it
smells
a
bit
macroey
with
very
very
slight
hints
of
the
roasted
malts
from
the
porter
used
the
porter
comes
through
more
in
the
taste
than
it
did
in
the
nose
i
definitely
get
the
roasted
malts
used
in
the
porter
and
a
pleasant
bitterness
this
is
a
nice
smooth
beer
and
is
one
i
could
definitely
drink
a
3
or
4
of
without
blinking
an
eye
very
enjoyable
and
if
not
for
the
poor
smell
would
be
even
more
so
drinkability
it
does
go
down
rather
easy
but
i
just
never
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
i
really
would
like
to
try
just
the
porter
that
goes
into
this
beer
d
pretty
bleh
offering
here
the
adjunct
lager
is
really
overdone
in
this
beer
and
just
detracts
from
any
part
of
it
that
could
be
enjoyable
d
nice
for
a
change
but
id
rather
just
drink
the
normal
lager
from
yuengling
seeing
a
bladder
of
a
portuguese
manofwar
floating
near
him
he
said
agua
mala
you
whore
drinkability
well
considering
that
i
do
not
especially
enjoy
this
beer
i
would
say
not
very
drinkable
however
like
i
mentioned
above
the
beer
is
light
on
the
mouth
and
the
stomach
so
if
you
like
the
taste
then
i
would
say
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
light
and
creamy
that
finshes
pretty
smooth
quite
drinkable
meh
thats
what
i
have
to
say
its
an
exact
cross
between
the
traditional
lager
and
the
porter
its
difficult
to
say
which
one
i
like
more
because
i
like
most
of
you
probably
like
different
beers
for
different
occasions
i
mean
the
yuengling
black
tan
isnt
bad
its
just
not
good
at
either
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
real
black
and
tan
obviously
yet
its
not
light
like
the
lager
or
thick
and
creamish
like
the
porter
i
would
rather
do
one
or
the
other
i
probably
wont
keep
this
in
the
fridge
unless
its
the
only
yuengling
available
at
the
store
overall
a
fine
beer
within
its
limitations
for
years
i
was
of
the
opinion
that
this
was
the
best
canned
beer
available
now
with
more
micros
being
available
in
cans
that
is
no
longer
true
but
this
is
still
a
fine
beer
you
should
try
it
the
beer
itself
looks
pretty
sexy
though
the
head
isnt
as
dark
as
i
would
have
expected
smells
a
bit
too
familiar
almost
like
a
traditional
yuengling
tasted
like
a
yuengling
as
well
just
darker
ive
been
recommended
this
beer
by
many
people
however
its
just
too
close
to
a
regular
yuengling
to
me
skål
taste
starts
off
with
some
mild
grain
astringency
light
roasted
malts
follow
with
some
semisweet
chocolate
nutty
with
some
caramel
toward
the
finish
faint
roasted
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
much
hop
presence
other
than
some
vague
lingering
bitterness
moderate
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
feel
not
bad
this
bottled
brew
shows
a
very
dark
black
mohogany
color
with
a
goodly
amount
of
oatmeal
colored
head
with
very
prevalent
lacing
the
aroma
is
charcoal
and
leafy
hop
with
sweet
malt
the
flavor
suggests
maple
malt
sweetness
and
dry
charcoal
woodsy
hop
approximately
a
mid
to
midlight
body
for
the
style
taastefully
carbonated
and
pretty
refreshing
it
has
a
bit
of
a
resinous
feel
all
around
a
very
passable
combo
brew
mixing
porter
and
lager
quite
drinkable
its
a
bit
of
a
macro
but
has
enough
redeeming
qualities
to
be
passable
for
an
evening
of
having
a
few
brewskis
i
take
it
at
face
value
a
black
and
tan
in
a
can
from
a
brewery
whose
lager
is
legendary
where
i
live
but
in
my
opinion
the
lager
is
bleckretchheave
if
youre
a
sadist
chug
a
warm
pitcher
yuenglings
porter
ive
always
dug
even
straight
out
of
the
bottle
this
black
and
tan
is
a
blend
of
their
porter
and
some
other
lighter
ale
i
suppose
anyway
as
far
as
blackandtansinacan
go
its
purdy
darn
good
you
mostly
taste
a
thin
version
of
their
porter
but
a
couple
and
yer
set
great
chillin
brew
taste
decently
agreeable
warms
on
you
just
isnt
satisfying
enough
tastes
like
they
stretched
the
bottom
line
and
watered
it
down
from
what
would
be
a
very
good
beer
decently
priced
notes
good
mouthfeel
but
neither
great
nor
bad
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
relatively
uninteresting
real
black
tans
are
fun
to
drink
due
to
the
transition
just
blending
the
two
ruins
the
experience
overall
drinks
like
a
light
brown
ale
this
is
a
classic
brew
from
yuengling
and
one
that
my
wife
and
i
drank
so
much
back
in
the
day
that
a
pitcher
would
appear
at
our
local
bar
without
having
to
ask
think
cheers
and
norm
this
would
be
a
nice
party
pleaser
to
satisfy
casual
drinkers
looking
to
try
a
dark
brew
tastes
pretty
good
goes
down
very
easy
and
would
not
offend
at
this
price
17
a
case
hate
pa
beer
lawyou
cant
go
wrong
i
think
it
may
be
groundbreaking
because
it
is
the
best
bt
than
i
have
tasted
that
i
havent
mixed
myself
but
there
are
too
much
unfamiliarity
that
i
usually
enjoy
in
my
beer
drinking
tm
excessive
carbonation
at
first
there
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
but
it
later
tastes
charred
the
taste
kind
of
falls
apart
where
the
aroma
wasnt
bad
its
slightly
metallic
with
more
dirty
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
sweet
caramel
in
the
middle
before
a
medium
finish
that
leaves
a
little
chocolate
and
not
a
lot
to
look
forward
to
in
the
next
sip
at
least
its
priced
accordingly
d
gotta
say
that
this
is
my
first
black
and
tan
i
didnt
go
in
with
any
expectations
but
was
suprised
at
what
i
found
it
does
go
down
easy
and
is
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
reasonable
beer
and
im
enjoying
it
for
what
it
is
i
will
have
no
problem
polishing
off
the
sixpack
mouthfeel
is
thin
not
much
body
drinkability
is
fine
as
its
basically
a
light
porter
yuengling
black
and
tan
poored
a
black
color
with
a
decent
head
similar
to
any
stout
there
wasnt
much
in
the
way
of
smell
it
taste
rather
light
but
not
too
light
kinda
of
like
a
lighter
stout
there
was
no
aftertaste
and
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
overall
it
was
one
of
the
better
yuenglings
and
it
was
cheap
so
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
budget
serving
type
bottle
smooth
to
drink
decent
carbonation
not
a
thick
brew
by
any
means

i
find
this
drink
from
the
can
to
be
just
so
incredible
in
drinkability
its
so
refreshing
and
so
enjoyable
its
something
i
often
now
seek
out
for
a
unique
and
refreshing
beer
and
it
has
to
be
stated
that
it
such
a
value
its
8
99
for
a
12
pack
and
its
really
a
nice
beer
for
the
price
even
though
its
cheaper
than
most
other
macros
a
beer
i
will
always
have
a
round
to
me
a
classic
bah
what
possessed
me
to
buy
this
im
not
sure
will
never
buy
again
and
will
probably
cook
with
the
rest
or
give
away
or
toss
this
beer
is
hardly
worth
pouring
into
a
pint
glass
but
a
high
pour
will
at
least
get
it
a
bit
less

this

its
worth

for
when
youre
just
thirsty

than
our

which
from

is
pretty
good
too
i
feel
good
supporting
an
american
family
owned
brewery
and
this
brewery
can
make
some
decent
brews
one
of
my
favorites
bt
pours
a
dark
red
tinged
mahogany
color
with
a
mocha
colored
head
with
fair
retention
the
nose
perhaps
my
least
favorite
attribute
is
one
of
clear
malts
and
wallpaper
paste
enveloped
in
a
cast
of
cocoa
powder
but
unlike
the
brews
from
saranac
which
are
a
insipid
mess
many
of
which
have
this
particular
characteristicwithout
the
cocoa
element
redeems
itself
with
flavors
that
are
enjoyable
and
result
in
true
drinking
satisfaction
sweet
dark
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
hops
provoke
a
nice
balance
between
sweetness
and
acidity
never
heavy
nor
overwhelming
this
brew
drinks
nice
in
any
season
or
during
any
session
d
very
drinkable
the
best
qualitycheap
grocery
store
beer
ive
found
drinkability
if
you
arent
thinking
about
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
then
it
is
an
overly
generic
extremely
drinkable
beer
it
has
the
possibility
to
be
good
but
if
the
beer
that
is
being
mixed
to
make
this
is
poor
then
the
black
and
tan
wont
be
any
better
taste
is
pretty
good
for
a
premade
bt
id
rather
mix
it
myself
but
for
what
it
is
its
surprisingly
good
worth
giving
a
shot
the
beer
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
somewhat
sizable
khaki
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
small
lace
it
appears
very
dark
but
when
held
up
to
a
light
source
you
can
see
through
it
clearly
the
smell
is
a
smoky
roasted
malt
aroma
it
hits
the
tongue
sweet
and
finishes
bitter
with
a
malty
flavor
prevalent
throughout
it
has
a
creamy
moderate
body
and
is
quite
drinkable
as
a
fan
of
yuenglings
traditional
lager
i
had
to
try
this
beer
i
had
my
first
a
few
years
back
and
i
still
drink
it
occasionally
while
its
not
one
to
blow
you
away
if
you
like
a
black
and
tan
its
not
bad
for
a
preblended
bottled
version
dvery
easy
to
drink
would
totally
keep
this
in
the
fridge
as
a
daily
drinker
if
i
had
regular
access
to
me
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
however
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
price
pours
dark
and
translucent
with
a
finger
of
tannish
rather
normal
looking
head
aroma
has
both
component
beers
in
it
the
lager
providing
a
slightly
hoppy
somewhat
grainy
note
and
then
a
touch
of
darker
sweeter
malt
with
a
bit
of
roast
from
the
porter
the
crispness
and
light
grain
of
the
lager
dominate
the
flavor
backed
up
some
chocolate
malt
that
solidifies
the
finish
body
feels
medium
with
a
moderate
amount
of
fizzish
bubbles
black
and
tans
arent
exactly
the
most
illustrious
style
but
even
for
this
category
it
is
a
fair
to
middling
brew
d
great
drinkability
not
too
heavy
nor
too
light
d
very
drinkable
great
session
beer
not
something
i
would
really
have
when
im
trying
to
appreciate
beer
but
always
a
welcome
brew
in
a
social
setting
with
minimal

summed
up

d
well
its
my

favorite
easy
to
get
beer
so
its
a
regular
in
my
fridge
by
default
and
i
could
do
way
worse
overall
this
is
a
serviceable
black
and
tan
when
money
is
tight
poured
from
the

to
a
dark

atop
the

was

was

the
taste
sightly
accentuated
the
flavors
of

long

not
watery
like
some
lower

dark
beers
tend
to
be
not
bad
at
all
especially
given
the
price
md
very
thin
mouthfeel
bit
overcarbonated
i
could
definitely
keep
some
of
this
around
to
drink
when
i
was
in
the
mood
for
cheap
easy
and
quick
and
not
light
overall
its
fairly
drinkable
in
that
theres
nothing
objectionable
to
it
it
offers
a
little
bit
of
flavor
and
a
fairly
nice
appearance
not
bad
served
in
a
23
ounce
glass
with
about
an
inch
of

and

crisp

nicely

with
a
kiss
of
hops
on
your
tongue
as
you
finish
very
drinkable
paired
well
with
grilled
chicken
and
sausage
pizza
an
okay
beer
if
they
are
being
offered
up
id
never
turn
one
down
but
not
something
to
keep
on
hand
as
a
rule
drinkability
is
good
because
of
the
nice
mouthfeel
however
there
is
not
a
ton
of
taste
going
on
here
i
would
not
drive
far
to
get
my
hands
on
this
but
grab
it
at
a
party
and
you
will
not
be
upset
i
have
had
many
more
beers
a
lot
more
expensive
than
this
choice
that
arent
as
good
pours
a
dark
brown
color
light
shines
through
with
a
amberish
hue
present
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
scent
is
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
an
odd
metallic
like
whiff
taste
is
a
blend
of
dark
roasted
watered
down
coffee
and
the
sweetness
of
watered
down
cola
metallic
like
taste
present
as
well
medium
bodied
small
aftertaste
fully
carbonated
tastes
more
like
a
watered
down
porter
than
a
black
and
tan
the
only
non
porter
quality
i
get
is
the
faint
metallic
scent
and
flavor
not
horrible
mind
you
but
nothing
special
beats
a
bmc
any
day
d
cant
have
too
many
they
are
kind
of
filling
d
good
drinkability
with
low
abv
d
rolls
down
pretty
easily
feel
and
drinkability
the
feel
is
all
wrong
carbonation
is
too
prickly
too
coarse
too
fine
it
calls
attention
to
itself
and
takes
away
from
the
beer
this
should
be
creamy
instead
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
sharp
feeling
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
happily
finished
off
the
twelve
pack
i
had
that
came
as
a
gift
but
there
was
something
i
recalled
and
am
kinda
getting
now
that
i
didint
like
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
a
bit
acidic
just
a
touch
in
taste
but
moreso
in
feel
it
kinda
creeps
up
the
throat
like
heartburn
after
a
few
of
these
i
also
dont
like
the
finish
on
this
one
dry
yes
but
just
not
a
great
aftertaste
almost
woody
with
those
chocolate
notes
fading
in
the
back
to
something
like
cardboard
not
very
impressive
easy
to
drink
yes
but
as
far
as
will
i
buy
this
ever
no
i
dont
see
why
people
go
bat
shit
crazy
for
yuengling
its
okay
maybe
good
at
best
and
thats
cause
the
price
for
something
of
this
quality
is
unbeatable
i
mean
look
at
berghof
from
what
i
hear
yuengling
is
cheaper
and
its
definitely
better
for
a
dollar
or
two
more
than
bud
hell
yeah
its
good
but
as
far
as
being
a
craft
brew
no
its
not
its
not
something
to
seek
out
it
is
the
best
cheap
good
beer
that
you
can
get
still
it
is
mild
and
very
easy
to
drink
so
the
12pack
was
not
a
complete
waste
of
money
an
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
brew
with
a
pleasant
malt
profile
next
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
amber
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
slight
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
hops
and
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
black
tan
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
slight
roasted
malt
slight
sweet
malt
yeast
and
a
finish
of
roasted
malt
overall
an
interesting
flavor
but
i
really
dont
know
how
to
rate
this
type
of
beer
just
avoid
yuengling
brews
in
general
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
from
the
porter
side
as
i
hadnt
had
it
before
not
the
worst
effort
ever
but
i
wouldnt
go
through
too
much
trouble
seeking
this
out
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
if
it
were
my
only
choice
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
d
a
great
session
beer
good
flavor
nice
balance
i
do
drink
this
beer
quite
often
the
price
is
low
and
the
quality
is
good
i
like
to
have
these
while
watching
a
game
d
i
dont
see
the
point
of
paying
extra
for
this
black
tan
if
youre
just
going
to
get
a
slight
variation
on
the
yuengling
lager
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
extremely
easydrinking
and
much
tastier
and
more
characterful
than
expected
from
my
first
black
and
tan
the
porter
shines
through
the
mix
and
leads
me
to
desire
a
taste
of
that
concoction
its
only
sad
that
it
isnt
available
in
this
area
drinkability
is
super
high
i
could
and
have
drank
these
all
day
just
enough
taste
to
satisfy
but
still
keep
it
highly
sessionable
the
benchmark
a
bt
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
few
beers
i
prefer
out
of
a
can
i
got
a
finger
of
mochatan
head
before
it
started
to
fall
away
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
as
to
the
nose
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
can
open
and
began
to
pour
it
smelled
like
willy
wonkas
chocolate
factory
in
my
humid
kitchen
leaning
in
i
got
anise
dark
chocolate
raisins
plums
zounds
yoi
and
double
yoi
smell
is
gettin
a
5
and
any
a
yinz
jagovs
wanna
argue
im
swingin
a
six
of
cans
atcha
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
definite
chocolate
taste
on
the
tongue
it
was
not
as
pronounced
as
on
the
nose
but
this
was
quite
good
my
brother
always
swore
by
ybt
in
a
can
but
i
never
understood
why
until
now
finish
had
a
lightly
smoky
quality
along
with
the
chocolate
is
it
too
late
to
take
this
off
of
my
gots
list
come
and
get
it
d
i
kinda
thought
this
would
be
an
abomination
of
two
styles
in
a
way
it
is
in
a
way
it
isnt
any
bt
ive
had
before
and
granted
its
been
a
few
years
was
always
mixed
on
the
spot
guinnessbass
as
an
example
this
premixed
version
lost
some
of
that
mixing
magic
if
you
will
but
still
is
tasty
drinkable
i
e
sessionable
and
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
could
be
pretty
enjoyable
all
told
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
more
though
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
d
easy
drinking
but
not
bursting
with
flavor
i
poured
into
a
nonic
glass
to
a
half
inch
of
light
tan
head
which
fled
in
a
hurry
it
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
it
smells
like
an
american
macro
maybe
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
it
tastes
like
a
watered
down
amber
bock
it
looks
a
lot
better
than
it
tastes
there
is
just
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
its
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
because
it
has
little
taste
d
a
decent
beer
that
you
could
definately
drink
a
lot
of
not
something
that
you
would
take
to
your
bosss
house
for
dinner
poured
a
very
nice
deep
brown
color
with
some
nice
head
and
lacing
good
scent
malty
with
some
deep
porter
scents
a
little
light
from
the
tan
and
not
as
deep
as
it
couldve
been
nice
taste

when

its

treat
and
only

very
affordable
but
not
very
intense

very
very
drinkable
and
appealing
this
is
one
of
those

is
really
great
to
get
a

it

i
could
definitely
drink
this
beer
all

and
it
could

become

flavor

straightforward

i
do

this

still

though
overall
its
on

side
not
terrible
for

theres
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
terribly
great
about
it
either
a
decent
bang
for
the
buck
wow
this
was
very
disappointing
and
considering
i
didnt
have
very
high
expectations
for
this
to
begin
with
that
really
says
something
it
poured
a
very
dark
mahogony
colour
but
was
crystal
clear
khaki
colour
foamy
cap
rested
nicely
on
top
for
several
seconds
before
subsiding
into
a
patchy
covering
looked
very
average
neither
appealing
or
offensive
smell
was
almost
like
something
akin
to
a
honey
brown
or
some
other
such
sweet
nonsense
reminded
me
a
bit
of
bmc
with
a
bit
of
syrup
added
for
sweetness
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
quick
malty
dryness
at
the
end
that
seems
to
say
ha
had
you
fooled
you
thought
there
was
about
to
be
something
pleasant
here
didnt
you
this
is
not
very
good
in
fact
this
may
get
sacrificed
to
the
kitchen
sink
as
i
always
say
in
total
fairness
to
the
brewer
and
his
or
her
intentions
this
may
have
its
fans
but
it
most
assuredly
is
not
for
me
d
ok
due
to
its
light
abv
and
body
i
could
easily
put
down
6
of
these
if
i
were
in
the
mood
to
easy
drinking
without
a
terrible
taste
bmc
makes
for
a
decent
fallback
beer
at
9
a
12
pack
not
a
lot
to
smell
and
taste
but
its
ok
its
good
especially
for
the
nine
dollars
i
put
down
on
this
twelve
drinks
pretty
easy
not
bad
went
well
with
sushi
am
i
overstating
the
mediocrity
i
dont
know
but
i
will
say
that
theres
nothing
inspirational
here
the
style
leads
one
to
expect
more
but
it
falls
short
of
any
real
anticipation
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
like
the
brewery
but
not
this
beer
especially
i
had
this
one
from
a
half
litre
can
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
about
2
fingers
but
it
does
not
last
long
turns
into
a
light
foam
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
good
like
dark
roasted
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
could
be
a
lot
better
its
kind
of
hard
to
describe
but
the
after
taste
is
like
metal
not
too
good
in
my
opinion
it
keeps
you
drinking
to
get
the
after
taste
out
of
your
mouth
i
would
not
make
this
a
beer
to
drink
for
long
periods
of
time
as
the
after
taste
lets
me
down
and
this
beer
can
fill
you
up
really
fast
because
its
really
heavey
not
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
better
for
a
cold
winter
night
but
i
would
recomend
at
least
trying
it
once
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
quickly
dissapearing
head
that
does
not
last
long
aroma
is
light
with
sweet
malt
and
diacetyl
taste
is
really
hard
to
describe
it
is
not
bad
but
not
something
to
write
home
about
either
overall
an
average
brew
that
is
not
something
i
am
dying
to
get
again
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
after
it
had
been
talked
up
by
a
friend
from
pa
its
certainly
worth
a
try
drinkability
light
mouthfeel
dry
finish
contribute
to
good
drinkability
could
be
a
good
babystep
into
dark
beer
for
someone
not
accustomed
take
a
macro
lager
and
add
some
chocolate
malt
flavor
and
you
get
the
idea
yuengling
black
tan
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
i
like
this
one
i
wasnt
expecting
much
either
some
roasted
malt
is
noticeable
and
the
finish
is
hoppy
i
could
see
keeping
some
of
this
in
the
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
definitely
worth
a
try
d
its
drinkable
but
if
im
going
to
have
a
black
tan
it
will
be
a
traditional
one
thin
mouthfeel
and
very
carbonated
easy
drinking
though
i
had
this
beer
from
a
cold
bottle
this
was
my
first
ever
bt
from
yuengling
poured
into
a
chilled
glass
the
head
was
not
huge
about
an
inch
cream
colored
which
contrasted
nicely
with
the
dark
almost
chocolate
like
color
with
two
or
three
small
bubble
trails
overall
a
very
good
looking
beer
there
really
wasnt
any
scent
so
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
strong
dark
malt
and
chocolatey
flavor
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
what
i
expected
more
like
what
i
would
expect
from
a
light
beerkind
of
watery
it
drank
very
well
and
it
was
very
hard
not
to
order
another
one
of
the
few
pleasant
surprises
i
have
had
from
this
local
pub
i
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
a
thin
lager
taste
up
front
gives
way
to
a
roasty
dark
malt
milky
and
chocolatey
smooth
finish
smooth
all
around
light
bitter
chocolate
aftertaste
roasty
finish
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
still
one
of
my
old
favorites
and
a
fine
session
beer
this
beer
is
on
the
mild
side
but
still
some
nice
flavors
come
through
if
im
looking
for
a
cheap
session
beer
id
say
this
is
it
this
is
a
great
outdoors
beer
because
it
tastes
real
good
out
of
the
can
the
bottles
taste
noticably
different
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
a
fairly
thin
blend
of
slight
burnt
flavors
including
coffee
and
chocolate
toasty
wasnt
that
bad
considering
its
a
black
tan
i
found
it
to
have
an
adequate
amount
of
flavor
so
good
that
they
should
make
a
scented
candle
from
it
but
for
a
premade
black
and
tan
in
a
bottle
the
taste
was
well
for
lack
of
a
better
clear
its
got
the
same
bubbles
and
almost
the
same
transparency
its
a
little
more
interesting
than
a
pils
hints
hints
hints
generally
bland
and
well
easy
to
drink
as
it
has
little
body
and
little
taste
not
as
good
as
the
porter
but
i
find
this
one
rather
quaffable
poured
out
to
a
dark
black
color
that
had
a
mahogany
like
hue
when
held
to
the
light
medium
low
level
of
carbonation
aromas
were
hard
to
distinguish
like

for

delicious

disappeared

and

as

d

more
like
a

ale
than
a
stout
i
would
be
more
inclined
to
drink
more
of
these
than
plain
stouts
in
one
setting
though
overall
its
quite
a
good
offering
the
beer
pours
a
dark

color
with
a
thin
offwhite

the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
slightly
malty
scent
with
a
nice

aroma
the
taste
is
great
it
has
excellent
malt
complexity
and
balance
it
also
has
a
great
hop
flavor
that
really
makes
this

the

with
good

this

drinks
great
i
love
the

awesome
black

wow
what
a
great
pourthe
pour
starts
out
out
black
on
top
and
light
on

but
u
can
watch
it
come
together
to
this
great
deep
amber
with
a
12
inch
head
that
never
leaves
and
leaves
some
great
lacing
aroma
is
of
highly
roast
malts
with
a
nice
intertwined
roasty
flavor
with
some
light
hoppiness
coming
from
the
pale
mixed
in
very
drinkable
and
definently
tasty
just
a
great
beer
taste
like
a
mixed
up
black
and
tan
amazingly
dark
in
color
half
stout
supposedly
half
eye
of
the
hawk
which
is
a
dark
coppery
red
impressive
color
considering
the
combo
light
frothy
head
dissapates
quickly
smells
decent
like
any
other
stout
but
light
and
modest
has
a
strong
metallic
taste
to
it
quite
strange
other
than
that
eye
of
the
hawkesque
stout
flavor
is
remarkable
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
in
the
middle
there
overall
i
say
3
an
a
quarter
although
the
metallic
taste
is
strange
theres
good
roast
character
not
overpowering
and
somewhat
substantial
malt
backbone
but
theres
a
minerally
acidic
character
that
is
offputting
becomes
somewhat
metallic
may
be
the
roast
acrid
notes
and
citrus
hops
clashing
an
easy
drinker
the
metallic
notes
took
some
points
away
but
not
good
overall
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
latticework
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
a
mild
char
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
soy
sauce
taste
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
seems
to
be
much
more
stout
forward
compared
to
the
other
beer
its
blended
with
o
i
was
a
bit
weary
of
buying
this
bottle
simply
because
it
looks
kind
of
cheap
and
tacky
at
face
value
also
i
had
no
idea
how
long
it
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
since
there
was
no
bottling
date
quite
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
well
balanced
beer
excellent
with
food
i
would
follow
this
beer
anywhere
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
and
tan
especially
as
prebottled
bts
go
i
cant
help
thinking
though
that
mendocino
would
be
better
served
using
their
imperial
stout
as
opposed
to
the
black
hawk
aroma
is
hoppy
as
heck
deep
citrus
and
pine
hops
lead
the
charge
here
crisp
clean
and
definitely
very
full
i
was
quite
impressed
with
the
way
this
one
was
starting
off
now
warming
allowed
some
nice
touches
of
roasted
malt
and
light
cocoa
to
balance
in
first
sip
though
left
no
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
the
direction
this
one
was
going
in
rich
hop
notes
dominate
every
ounce
of
flavor
here
piercing
at
times
with
pine
and
grapefruit
taking
turns
with
the
destruction
of
my
taste
buds
overall
i
didnt
have
much
expectation
for
this
but
it
was
a
very
tasty
black
and
tan
in
fact
one
of
the
best
i
had
so
far
out
of
only
a
few
try
it
if
you
like
the
style
o
my
first
black
and
tan
good
experience
i
enjoyed
it
notes
drinkable
and
pleasant
with
slightly
more
assertive
hops
than
you
find
in
east
coast
blended
black
and
tans
overall
to
be
honest
i
was
hoping
this
one
was
going
to
be
just
a
bit
better
in
the
flavor
department
it
wasnt
bad
but
good
either
so
it
kind
of
let
me
down
split
this
with
my
roomie
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
nearly
opaque
black
head
was
minimal
despite
a
vigorous
pour
lacing
is
halfassed
at
best
the
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
almost
reminds
me
of
a
bock
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
decent
it
seems
to
have
a
pretty
hefty
cherry
component
somewhere
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
leaves
behind
a
bit
of
a
tart
cherry
aftertaste
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
can
drink
it
o
i
really
like
black
hawk
stout
and
eye
of
the
hawk
seperately
this
is
a
unique
and
bold
attempt
to
bottle
a
black
tan
imagine
if
you
just
put
guinness
and
bass
together
in
a
bottle
yeah
that
i
was
told
i
can
order
one
of
these
fresh
off
of
the
tap
right
at
the
brewery
near
my
house
in
saratoga
springs
i
might
have
to
try
it
that
way
and
review
it
again
o
excellent
value
at
3
a
22oz
it
actually
tastes
like
a
good
beer
not
an
award
winner
but
this
is
on
a
different
planet
when
compared
to
most
swill
in
this
price
range
i
think
if
i
were
to
choose
i
would
rather
have
an
eye
of
the
hawk
or
black
hawk
stout
alone
as
opposed
to
this
blend
instead
of
craving
another
sip
i
find
myself
craving
the
more
complex
flavors
of
a
nice
stout
which
the
black
eye
cannot
live
up
to
overall
this
beer
was
excellent
the
price
was
perfect
at
2
99
and
the
flavors
really
popped
this
is
really
a
gem
to
find
in
a
store
and
i
am
blown
away
by
this
brewery
i
must
try
more
like
a
true
black
and
tanstout
flavors
are
mitigated
by
a
pale
ale
my
only
complaint
is
the
body
which
is
on
the
thin
side
the
darker
malts
are
light
enough
to
allow
the
hop
to
pleasantly
blend
in
the
aftertaste
continues
this
blend
and
it
lasts
a
long
time
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
is
worth
the
try
it
was
a
good
my
i
would
definitely
repeat
and
would
recommend
it
to
people
who
like
portersstouts
is
black
and
tan
really
a
style
not
really
its
more
of
a
marketing
thing
while
many
beers
are
blended
bts
are
an
odd
concept
and
im
not
sure
of
the
make
up
of
this
one
and
apparently
are
too
lazy
to
use
google
its
light
in
body
and
finishes
like
a
porter
with
some
mild
sweetness
at
the
front
the
beer
is
boring
overall
but
its
quite
drinkable
a
passer
on
a
highway
nothing
to
notice
mendocino
black
eye
ale
is
a
pretty
average
beer
the
roastiness
of
the
black
was
not
very
pronounced
with
little
acrid
coffee
or
chocolate
the
tan
provides
a
nice
clean
crisp
body
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
distinct
flavor
or
a
special
character
but
unoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
pretty
good
beer
whatever
style
it
is
or
its
being
called
poured
with
a
great
foamy
frothy
thick
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lace
color
is
a
clear
to
almost
opaque
very
dark
brown
aroma
is
a
clean
roast
malt
toffee
cocoa
flavor
is
like
aroma
plus
bittersweetness
stands
out
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
of
medium
length
and
leaves
me
with
a
wish
for
another
swallow
session
beer
honestly
en
route
to
putting
up
200
in
beer
purchases
a
little
while
back
i
grabbed
this
intriguing
little
item
so
i
could
have
a
bottle
in
the
basket
carts
are
for
the
weak
and
smart
that
didnt
have
a
cost
in
the
double
digits
not
a
bad
little
investment
it
pours
a
barely
translucent
dark
ruby
brown
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
chocolate
powder
light
roasted
malts
and
some
very
light
coffee
the
taste
is
nearly
identical
though
some
creamy
caramel
flows
nicely
into
the
finish
the
body
is
firm
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
creamy
feel
overall
nice
bit
o
brew
one
that
i
would
recommend
as
a
notsoroasty
darker
beer
get
some

beer
at

a
bomber
this
is
a
really
good
value
brew
this
black
tan
has
a
decent
chance
of
being
ordered
again
but
the
slightly
acidic
dry
aftertaste
will
get
tiresome
all
in
all
a
great
beer
to
finish
up
a
day
spent
out
in
the
cold
ice
climbing
skiing
or
snowshoeing
this
beer
refreshes
and
i
could
definitely
see
myself
going
back
for
more
mendocino
black
eye
ale
is
just
on
the
edge
of
brown
and
black
the
big
fluffy
beige
head
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
roasty
aroma
with
tangy
malt
on
the
nose
there
are
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
something
slightly

its
medium
bodied
and
smooth
the
finish
is
a
little
scratchy
and
metallic
its
a
little
sweet
a
little
bitter
good
balance
it
tastes
roasty
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
licorice
and
black
cherry
the
rumbly
boozy
finish
makes
it
taste
stronger
than
it
is
green
bitterness
provides
the
aftertaste
its
reasonably
complex
not
for
chugging
md
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
black
and
tan
but
by
no
means
a
great
example
very
heavily
skewed
to
the
dark
side
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
but
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
pours
a
very
fark
brown
with
tan
colored
head
extremely
strong
malt
smell
to
the
beer
mainly
smells
of
caramel
with
some
choclate
as
well
but
the
smell
is
intense
the
beer
is
extremely
sweet
possibly
a
little
oversweet
just
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
aftertaste
as
well
overall
the
beer
is
a
little
thick
for
easy
drinking
and
the
sweetness
is
a
little
too
much
for
my
taste
drinks
great
very
sessionable
all
in
all
not
a
terrible
beer
especially
for
the
2
i
payed
hopefully
the
talon
i
bought
with
it
for
3
will
be
better
had
my
first
one
at
the
brewery
was
a
little
skeptical
of
how
it
would
taste
out
the
bottle
but
its
damn
good
a
value
too
as
it
can
be
had
for
less
than
5
a
bomber
d
a
great
hoppy
stout
that
drinks
nicely
more
flavorful
that
many
beers
at
this
abv
quite
the
steal
at
less
than
4
a
bomber
too
overall
different
and
well
worth
a
try
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonate
rich
and
smooth
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
is
a
tasty
beer
well
rounded
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
the
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
but
drinkability
is
decent
the
sweetness
may
limit
you
to
a
couple
of
glasses
this
is
a
pretty
good
premixed
black
tan
i
would
buy
and
consume
on
an
occasional
basis
the
price
was
3
09
at
sams
in
downers
grove
and
that
is
a
good
deal
d
there
just
isnt
enough
here
overall
to
inspire
me
to
drink
more
than
a
glass
at
us3
99
for
a
22ounce
in
2009
ill
probably
look
elsewhere
for
my
beer
next
time
around
still
worth
the
try
skip
skip

a
nice
dark

not
much
there

a

nothing

you

so
fairly
high
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
d
not
a
fan
of
the
milky
aftertaste

this
brew
isnt
bad
good
stuff
pours

thick

falls

chalky
the

is
dismayingly
thin

you
like

i
love
this
beer
and
its
very
easy
to

its
not

its
not

i
wouldnt
go
back
for
it
again
nor
would
i
turn

with
a
finger
of

very
little

some
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
beans
hit
the
nose
but
not
strongly
flavor
begins
with
burnt
chocolate
and
ends
with
some
hop
bitterness
not
much
special
to
this
beer
really
other
than
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
drinkable
but
bland
this
beer
porued
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
the
smell
is
mostly
toasted
malt
with
a
little
burnt
coffee
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
that
are
cut
by
some
citrusy
hops
towards
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
pretty
minor
carbonation
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
for
black
and
tan
but
i
cant
imagine
id
want
much
more
in
one
sitting
than
what
was
in
the
big
bottle
popped
this
opened
after
a
3
store
beer
run
today
after
being
snowed
in
for
days
beer
had
a
big
head
much
like
my
own
mouthfeel
was
ok
while
its
not
bad
i
cant
find
much
to
recommend
it
either
it
is
rather
drinkable
very
unremarkable
i
wont
be
buying

could
have
finished
the
bomber
individually
light
in
alcohol
and
on
the
stomach
as
a
result
not
a
bad
brew
for
the
winter
always
interesting
to
have
a
black
and
tan
that
is
bottled
and
not
poured
by
yourself
would
probably
drink
this
again
especially
with
how
inexpensive
it
is
worth
trying

good

with
a
short

great

of
burnt
coffee
nuts
toasted

and
some
cocoa
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted

in

front
that

slowly
with
a
malty

and
peppery
hop
back
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
a
little
thin
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
isnt
my
taste
in
the
style
but
not
something
i
was
gonna
pour
out
i
havent
had
either
of
the
base
beers
so
i
cant
really
comment
on
my
thoughts
on
the
blend
overall
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
but
am
not
sure
ill
be
having
it
again
anytime
soon
or
honestly
if
ever
drinkability
one
of
mendocino
brewings
less
successful
brews
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
the
stout
is
the
winner
here
and
the
tan
is
bringing
down
the
beer
a
little
i
could
see
enjoying
this
as
a
pint
out
but
i
still
am
perplexed
that
there
is
even
a
black
and
tan
category
i
checked
bjcp
and
ok
kidding
on
that
note
but
this
is
a
nice
blended
beer
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
mostly
dark
toast
with
hints
of
caramelized
prunes
chcoclate
and
fruity
wine
the
elements
are
nicely
married
and
it
is
pretty
drinkable
and
smooth
however
it
is
a
bit
flat
and
onedimensional
in
character
with
a
little
too
much
dark
toast
i
find
the
latter
kind
of
confusing
since
neither
the
supposed
constituent
beers
has
much
of
a
strong
dark
toast
character
to
me
ultimately
while
this
is
good
i
prefer
the
constituent
beers
separately
d
eh
this
beer
does
little
to
excite
me
its
not
bad
but
its
fairly
uninteresting
which
is
a
shame
because
i
really
liked
the
eye
of
the
hawk
the
flavors
just
dont
mesh
terribly
and
this
brew
ends
up
tasting
like
a
strange
porter
on
the
full
side
of
mediumbodied
the
drink
is
nicely
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
i
must
say
i
didnt
hold
out
high
hopes
for
this
bomber
and
am
not
real
big
on
blackandtans
in
general
but
this
was
a
fine
drink
that
really
hit
the
spot
and
went
just
fine
with
a
breakfast
of
mediumrare
strip
steak
overeasy
eggs
and
toast
interesting
beer
here
i
really
appreciate
the
distinct
discernability
between
the
ale
and
the
stout
with
each
sip
you
may
taste
one
the
other
or
both
there
is
not
enough
presence
in
the
nose
to
have
this
same
quality
in
the
smell
as
there
isnt
much
there
in
that
regard
the
offering
is
very
drinkable
as
well
a
bit
lighter
in
the
mouth
than
i
would
prefer
but
good
nonetheless
this
makes
me
want
to
try
the
two
separately
to
see
how
the
whole
compares
to
the
sum
of
its
parts
body
is
medium
well
carbonated
and
somewhat
thin

is
typically
very

so
theres
no

try
it

call
this

the

blend
i
might
just
think
its

but
kinda
boring
for
the
price
i
paid
222oz
its
pretty
good
and
roasted

body
is
slightly

followed
by
a
yeasty

blends
overall
with
having
the

i
was
wholly
underwhelmed
with
this
black
and
tan
or
amber
or
whatever
the
brewer
was
trying
to
accomplish
good
causes
aside
brew
a
beer
that
is
worthy

a

overall
mild
and
easy
enough
to
drink
overall
a
decent
sessioning
beer
lets
see
two
beers
i
didnt
particularly
didnt
care
for
blended
together
as
a
black
and
tan
good
idea
appears
a
dark
amber
murky
brown
hue
with
alight
beige
head
forms
fine
speckled
lacing
lets
take
a
smell
of
it
some
malty
dark
roasted
malt
layers
with
herbal
hops
cooking
in
the
back
end
actually
like
biscuit
dough
and
yeast
cakes
is
what
im
getting
in
the
smell
a
malt
driven
slightly
sour
dough
bread
flavor
with
some
dark
roasts
and
pale
cocoa
driven
malt
kicking
the
backend
of
this
beer
im
okay
with
these
guys
im
a
nurse
and
they
are
firefighters
donating
toward
local
burn
centers
for
anybody
out
there
who
has
seen
a
bad
burn
victim
believe
me
youll
never
argue
with
this
foundationfundraising
group
does
that
concept
make
this
a
better
black
and
tan
of
course
not
but
it
is
what
it
is
a
contract
brewed
charity
driven
beer
label
brewed
in
wilkes
barre
pa
and
the
actual
company
is
based
out
of
maryland
note

and
considered
a
black
tan
by
the
brewer
as
this
is
a
blend
of
65
golden
ale
and
35
backdraft
brown
ale
regardless
it
drinks
more
like
an
amber
give
the
light
texture
and
notable
sweetness
drinkability
ok
i
would
drink
it
again
definitely
not
bad
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
pretty
boring
but
its
not
bad
while
drinking
this
i
kept
thinking
that
the
brown
ale
component
of
this
might
pretty
good
but
this
just
tastes
to
me
like
a
brown
ale
that
has
been
watered
down
a
bit
d
a
mediocre
beer
at
best
the
harsh
carbonation
bothers
me
the
most
its
so
damn
filling
besides
that
there
really
isnt
much
to
behold
here
its
all
bland
i
would
never
turn
it
down
but
its
another
hook
and
ladder
i
wouldnt
search
out
the
taste
is
light
whole
wheat
slightly
musty
apple
light
mineral
and
caramelbrown
sugar
elements
are
subdued
not
meshed
particularly
well
simple
ad
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
with
little
bitterness
however
its
pleasant
has
at
elast
some
character
and
is
only
slightly
onthe
seet
sidel
almost
getting
a
dryish
finish
drinkability
an
all
around
approachable
sessionable
brew
that
could
be
consumed
all
year
round
not
a
barnburner
but
a
solidly
crafted
beer
pretty
solid
if
not
down
right
quaffable
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
thin
head
formed
disappeared
quickly
as
advertised
it
is
an
amber
color
but
the
whole
ember
bit
not
understanding
it
i
expected
to
taste
a
roasted
malt
out
of
this
beer
but
it
is
pretty
plain
i
have
had
darker
fuller
black
and
tans
before
the
hops
are
practically
nonexistent
and
i
feel
like
im
tasting
a
generic
mainstream
beer
its
light
enough
to
throw
back
a
few
of
these
but
id
rather
not
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
hook
and
ladder
notes
overall
its
not
bad
at
all
but
its
also
not
a
standout
either
body
is
pretty
thin
pretty
light
and
watery
texture
its
a
decently
smooth
drinker
though
and
mostly
inoffensive
there
really
isnt
much
too
this
not
much
flavor
and
really
no
detectable
hops
to
even
provide
some
balance
could
use
more
caramel
sweetness
and
just
a
minimal
hop
profile
to
balance
it
out
a
bit
more
bland
is
the
best
word
to
describe
it
ember
amber
is
certainly
no
black
and
tan
and
none
of
the
character
from
the
backdraft
brown
shines
through
pretty
mediocre
but
still
worth
a
try
bit
think
in
the
mouthfeel
maybe
the
fact
that
its
60
golden
ale
is
kinda
throwing
me
off
getting
some
toffee
caramel
and
a
bit
of
roastiness
its
a
good
drinker
for
sure
but
just
nothing
to
make
me
seek
this
beer
out
again
dgoes
down
real
easy
this
is
a
definitely
a
beer
that
you
can
have
more
than
one
of
if
you
like
third
hook
and
ladder
i
tried
from
the
sampler
12
pack
poured
from
bottle
to
sa
pint
glass
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
of
cream
head
that
reduced
to
a
nice
bubble
sheen
with
some
spotty
lacing
smell
is
mild
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
taste
is
a
mild
sweet
malt
flavor
of
the
brown
ale
that
is
muted
by
the
golden
thin
wattery
mouthfeel
drinkable
yes
but
i
will
have
my
nonba
guests
suck
the
other
two
of
these
down
if
i
wanted
a
black
and
tan
i
would
pour
it
myself
this
is
a
lame
filler
in
this
sampler
the
beer
is
not
all
bad
but
the
concept
is
they
didnt
brew
a
fourth
beer
so
they
put
two
together
and
bottled
it
and
called
it
ember
amber
lame
d
skip
it
and
drink
the
hl
brown
or
irish
red
ales
i
was
actually
in
harris
teeter
and
a
representive
from
hook
ladder
was
giving
out
free
samples
ember
amber
is
a
combination
of
65
golden
ale
and
35
backdraft
brown
pours
a
clear
nutty
brown
with
a
small
white
head
yeasty
aroma
smooth
but
thin
palate
very
slight
hop
note
but
too
thin
to
really
note
not
too
bad
if
i
run
into
a
place
that
has
both
backdraft
and
golden
ale
on
tap
ill
mix
myself
an
amber
my
suggestion
find
a
six
pack
of
the
brown
and
leave
everything
else
alone
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
and
lacing
the
beer
smelled
like
all
the
rest
of
the
beers
in
the
sample
pack
i
think
they
are
all
made
from
each
other
no
matter
i
did
not
like
this
one
of
all
the
others
i
tried
it
is
a
combo
of
two
others
and
taste
like
neither
it
was
kinda
sweet
with
a
malty
hit
to
it
but
rather
confusing
no
the
beer
doesnt
really
offend
but
there
are
better
places
to
go
for
an
amber
or
a
halfandhalf
gees
i
sure
dont
get
the
blended
beers
this
beer
tastes
alot
like
some
lower
end
oktoberfests
ive
had
but
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
fairly
light
very
smooth
and
quite
the
session
beer
imho
would
pair
great
with
some
smoked
meats
or
just
about
anything
fairly
impressive
just
nothing
stellar
i
do
like
though
good
beer
d
easy
drinking
as
poundable
as
a
newcastle
this
beer
is
quite
fruity
tasting
with
a
definite
berry
note
as
well
as
a
touch
of
soft
citrus
character
that
must
be
hop
derived
the
flavor
has
a
solid
malt
character
to
it
that
provides
a
nice
toasted
nuttiness
toasted
malt
notes
a
hint
of
roast
character
though
this
is
quite
subtle
as
well
as
a
sweet
caramelized
malt
character
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
am
a
bit
surprised
by
how
subtle
the
stout
influence
is
but
this
is
nicely
balanced
yet
characterful
enough
to
stay
interesting
strange
a
blend
of
a
pale
ale
and
their
porter
appearance
is
a
brown
transparent
porter
taste
is
slightly
hoppy
medium
biscuit
light
chocolate
and
licorice
5
abv
overall
light
on
flavor
and
mouthfeel
unique
the
carbonation
is
strong
and
lagerlike
with
small
bubbles
the
liquid
is
midsmooth
d
not
a
beer
ill
buy
again
not
bad
but
not
the
opposite
either
nothing
really
stands
out
but
nothing
is
really
bad
goes
probably
well
with
the
traditional
swedish
cuisine
the
gaudy
label
with
bright
colours
made
me
keep
lowered
expectations
but
i
think
its
an
okay
but
average
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
either
this
sweedish
offering
is
okay
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
more
and
it
definitely
fails
to
achieve
the
altstyle
it
seems
to
want
to
emulate
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
beans
and
brewed
coffee
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
great
aroma
and
tasty
flavor
but
the
grazias
part
of
the
beer
is
lost
in
all
of
the
coffee
aromas
and
flavors
d
a
beer
thats
all
over
the
place
it
tries
to
have
a
little
of
everything
it
lacks
hops
if
you
buy
a
czech
beer
you
should
be
able
to
expect
more
hops
than
this
however
it
goes
down
really
smoothly
an
odd
beer
with
an
odd
slight
taste
will
not
buy
again
not
so
exciting
could
be
a
good
everyday
beer
were
it
not
for
the
thin
mouthfeel
and
unbalanced
mix
of
flavors
pity
im
not
sure
if
this
new
half
n
half
is
a
good
idea
by
zlatopramen
but
then
this
is
a
a
weird
style
my
bottle
poured
with
about
two
centimeters
of
foam
and
with
a
very
dark
amber
color
the
aroma
was
first
dominated
by
a
sugarcane
sweet
smell
gradually
taken
over
by
flowery
hops
the
taste
was
a
strange
mix
of
roasted
malts
and
red
berries
to
its
advantage
i
must
say
that
it
has
a
pronounced
character
and
a
taste
that
doesnt
leave
any
empty
spaces
not
for
my
palate
though
to
some
extent
i
guess
that
this
is
the
point
of
such
a
beer
blend
o
definitely
feels
like
much
more
stout
than
ipa
in
spite
of
the
reality
didnt
get
the
complexity
of
flavor
that
i
expected
its
still
a
really
nice
beer
o
i
would
love
to
try
making
a
black
tan
with
yin
yang
and
comparing
it
to
this
as
is
id
call
if
more
of
a
black
ipa
than
a
true
mixed
black
tan
but
still
a
very
solid
beer
from
my
favorite
brewer
pours
almost
black
smells
of
smoke
sweet
sour
with
hints
of
liquorish
taste
is
smoky
sweet
skunk
with
a
bitter
malty
finish
feel
is
somewhat
heavy
but
lightens
up
with
the
hoppy
finish
overall
im
disappointed
and
hope
that
i
got
an
old
batch
i
will
revisit
and
pay
attention
to
its
age
not
a
hung
fan
of
stouts
i
dont
really
taste
the
hops
more
stout
on
the
nose
with
a
solid
feel
and
a
slightly
hoppy
almost
spicy
finish
real
interesting
well
done
et
o
to
sum
it
up
in
1
word
intense
the
first
few
sips
are
strong
to
say
the
least
massive
bitterness
that
is
damn
near
overwhelming
as
it
warms
it
mellows
out
and
blends
fairly
well
at
10
the
strength
of
the
flavors
going
on
it
can
be
a
real
kick
in
the
face
but
a
hell
of
an
experience
i
think
as
good
or
better
than
the
sum
of
its
constituent
parts
the
ipa
is
still
a
little
intense
for
me
as
this
comes
across
as
much
as
an
imperial
black
ipa
as
anything
else
interesting
and
unique
getting
better
all
the
time
as
it
warms
chocolate
notes
dry
cocoa
raw
dark
and
a
touch
of
bitter
bakers
are
all
here
when
it
gets
to
room
temperature
and
the
hops
in
the
finish
push
bitterness
double
jeopardy
but
they
do
also
compliment
each
other
pretty
well
complex
and
huge
but
the
booze
doesnt
show
through
all
that
much
its
the
body
that
makes
this
one
gigantic
viscous
teeth
coating
and
almost
harsh
lots
of
big
dark
beers
from
evil
twin
some
better
than
others
but
the
intense
hop
complexion
of
this
one
makes
it
unlike
any
of
his
others
creamy
in
feel
frothy
and
drying
as
it
moves
along
worth
the
three
bucks
and
change
i
paid
for
a
single
no
doubt
about
that
but
these
beers
all
three
of
them
seem
overly
aggressive
and
not
as
well
refined
as
they
probably
could
be
still
a
cool
blending
project
given
the
hoppy
nature
of
the
ipa
component
drinkability
evil
twin
stouts
are
among
my
favorite
and
while
this
is
very
nice
i
prefer
both
the
yin
and
the
yang
better
on
their
own
still
this
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
black
and
tan
pours
out
interesting
with
a
much
darker
body
on
the
top
and
a
a
lighter
relatively
speaking
amber
on
the
bottom
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
settles
down
and
leaves
some
nice
stickysoapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
muddled
which
isnt
surprising
for
a
bottle
black
and
tan
the
taste
though
is
a
nice
blend
with
deep
roasted
malt
notes
of
coffee
and
hops
blending
perfectly
the
body
has
a
nice
thickness
to
it
and
theres
just
a
little
bite
to
it
on
the
finish
this
is
beer
tan
has
intense
aromas
and
tastes
a
pure
mix
of
dipa
and
imperial
stout
prominent
characteristics
of
both
styles
i
was
a
little
skeptical
but
was
rather
impressed
this
beer
seriously
awesome
black
and
tan
that
is
kind
of
a
black
ipa
overall
im
not
a
black
and
tan
guy
but
ets
version
of
an
imp
black
and
tan
is
nice
this
is
worth
your
time
if
you
see
it
around
overall
id
say
this
is
by
far
the
best
bottled
black
tan
that
ive
ever
had
and
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
and
highly
recommend
the
overall
score
of
4
5
may
seem
high
but
this
is
the
best
in
class
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
bottled
black
tan
category
very
creamyalmost
like
drinking
a
dark
chocolate
milkshake
i
can
detect
a
touch
of

dark

of
creaminess

it
above

with
a
bit
of
effervescence
in
the
middle
and
more
in
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
intense
quite
complex
and
reasonably
balanced
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
sweetness
that
rapidly
fades
into
a
blended
bitterness
of
hops
and
roast
as
the
bitterness
fades
grapefruit
rind
and
pine
hop
flavors
become
dominant
these
in
turn
yield
to
a
mild

over
a

the
finish
is
a
lingering
rind
bitterness
over
heavy
notes
of
alcohol
and
hints
of
prune
i
think
i
like
yin
yang
a
liiittle
bit
more
than
i
like
each
on
their
own
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
changes
a
lot
with
the
temperature
it
has
a
lot
of
the
characters
of
a
rich
hearty
stout
but
it
adds
a
pretty
nice
dash
of
hops
to
make
it
taste
like
an
overhopped
imperial
stout
again
not
quite
an
imperial
black
ipa
in
my
opinion
the
price
is
a
little
high
but
so
is
the
abv
and
more
importantly
the
quality
of
the
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
just
make
sure
you
get
it
relatively
fresh
so
you
can
enjoy
the
hops
that
only
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
beer
can
offer
i
will
need
to
retaste
this
to
do
it
its
honors
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
you
dont
see
too
many
pre
mixed
black
and
tans
especially
ones
that
are
on
the
stronger
side
but
this
one
turned
out
to
be
a
nice
beer
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
slightly
warming
a
little
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
the
bitterness
might
start
to
wear
on
me
if
i
have
more
than
that
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
in
the
taste
and
the
appearance
to
me
those
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
pretty
unbalanced
and
i
wish
the
stout
aspects
showed
up
more
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
wants
a
black
and
tan
that
showcases
roasted
and
hoppy
flavors
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
ended
up
enjoying
it
a
little
more
than
just
yin
by
itself
the
ipa
brings
some
balance
and
complexity
that
yin
was
lacking
this
is
one
of
the
better
evil
twin
beers
ive
had
and
so
far
its
my
favorite
black
and
tan
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
tasty
black
and
tan
keep
up
the
solid
work
pours
a
mostly
stout
appearance
with
dark
brown
color
and
tancocoa
colored
head
nice
amount
of
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
the
nose
features
all
of
the
roastiness
of
an
impy
stout
with
a
heavy
dose
of
piney
hops
this
is
a
nice
balance
between
styles
the
flavor
starts
with
roastiness
and
quickly
transitions
into
heavy
bitterness
this
drinks
like
a
really
hopped
up
imperial
stout
like
storm
king
or
old
rasputin
the
body
is
medium
to
light
for
style
and
the
carbonation
is
a
touch
high
overall
a
delicious
beer
definitely
satisfies
the
cravings
of
a
nice
big
stout
and
a
bitter
imperial
ipa
more
roast
than
a
black
ale
and
definitely
more
hops
than
your
avverage
stout
first
off
for
a
black
tan
this
is
boss
pours
like
a
stout
33
blend
and
it
smells
hoppy
like
your
ipa
call
this
an
imperial
black
ipa
because
thats
pretty
much
what
it
is
the
aroma
has
plenty
of
hoppy
notes
with
pine
and
citrus
melding
into
a
slightly
smokey
malt
profile
in
the
taste
stout
flavor
with
the
base
of
charcoal
and
coffee
gives
way
to
a
citrusy
grapefruit
flavored
hop
note
slight
alcohol
tingles
the
throat
but
really
pretty
well
hidden
alcohol
content
this
is
the
granddaddy

be
afraid
just
be
prepared
roast

flavor

character
of
plums
and
sweet
cherries
lots
of
alcohol
and
floral
esters
which
is
juxtaposed
by
a
bitter
roasty
hoppy
resiny
finish
the
booze
and
bitterness
dominate
but
the
underlying
fruit
character
is
wonderful

and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
big
abv
definitely
felt
like
an
imperial
black
ipa
with
the
big
hoppiness
would
be
interested
in
aging
this
one
to
see
what
happens
a
very
enjoyable
offering

from
maltitude
pours
dark
black
with
frothy
tan
head
aroma
of
dark

hops
taste
of
strong
bitter

and
a

of
floral
bitter
hops
on
the
back
end
very
good
black
ipa
this
beer
couldve
gone
haywire
but
they
balancedmixed
it
well
and
both
styles
of
beer
come
through
dark
brown
ale
with
taste
of
cococa
nibs
bitter
dark
chocolate
cigar
liquorish
burnt
tasty
sugar
thick
creamy
molasis
body
overall
well
im
glad
i
gave
this
style
a
go
i
would
like
to
try
a
small
version
maybe
giving
me
a
different
experience
interesting
to
say
the
least
o
more
like
a
black
ipa
but
so
much
more
intense
i
think
the
blend
is
too
confusing
to
the
taste
buds
and
even
the
olfactory
i
prefer
my
yin
and
yang
in
separate
glasses
o
this
isnt
the
most
harmonious
blend
ive
ever
had
but
it
may
as
well
be
the
most
harmonious
premade
blend
ill
likely
have
as
much
as
i
enjoy
this
id
personally
rather
just
buy
yin
and
yang
separately
despite
my
mild
reservations
this
one
is
still
quite
good
i
cant
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
is
the
least
impressive
beer
ive
had
from
evil
twin
its
definitely
interesting
but
it
feels
like
the
hoppiness
it
was
meant
to
have
has
gone
past
its
prime
a
gamble
i
lost
on
i
suppose
o
two
of
the
three
tasters
on
this
review
felt
the
combination
was
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
really
nice
beer
o
this
beer
is
rather
unique
and
seems
to
have
interesting
properties
from
both
the
ipa
and
stout
used
to
create
this
blend
its
definitely
a
beer
to
sip
and
savor
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
o
i
have
had
both
of
the
base
beers
for
this
separately
and
have
made
my
own
version
of
this
black
tan
at
home
but
this
would
be
the
first
time
ive
had
the
black
tan
from
the
brewery
though
i
do
not
remember
the
beer
being
this
big
in
the
past
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
a
little
more
well
hidden
this
is
a
big
beer
and
needs
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
slowly
this
is
a
mess
and
typical
not
only
of
the
dreaded
and
stupid
black
ipa
but
the
imperial
black
ipa
this
was
not
enjoyable
for
me
at
all
i
was
excited
to
see
that
evil
twin
had
bottled
a
yin
and
yang
i
had
made
and
reviewed
my
own
black
and
tan
from
5050
yin
and
yang
a
few
years
ago
interestingly
my
old
review
indicated
that
the
toasted
malt
and
stout
character
overwhelmed
the
barleywine
elements
in
the
twobottle
mix
this
bottled
version
seems
to
have
the
opposite
flavor
progression
and
is
much
better
balanced
i
wish
i
had
bought
two
of
these
now
although
it
was
pricey
o
id
really
like
to
know
the
ibus
on
this
its
definitely
on
the
bitter
side
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
its
over
100
still
very
nicely
balanced
and
really
showcases
both
beers
not
really
like
an
american
black
ale
or
hoppy
stout
definitely
a
style
unto
itself
for
being
11
1
this
drinks
dangerously
easily
its
a
good
thing
this
is
only
11
2
oz
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
mixing
your
own
bts
o
a
lot
sweeter
than
expected
doesnt
reach
the
cloying
point
but
gets
fairly
close
dont
get
much
of
the
yin
imperial
stout
i
would
prefer
a
75
yin
25
yang
blend
d
amazing
balance
really
nice
complexity
better
than
each
of
the
base
beers
low
b
definitely
would
seek
this
out
again
on
draft
overall
tasty
an
unusual
beer
but
i
like
it
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
harvest
wine
spirits
in
west
hartford
ct
poured
into
a
rochefort
goblet
very
dark
brown
with
a
petri
dish
bubbling
on
top
amaaazing
memories
of
hops
banana
clove
garlic
ginger
and
other
scents
coming
off
this
right
from
the
pour
the
taste
backs
it
up
with
tons
to
explore
the
mouthfeel
leaves
you
with
something
to
remember
overall
this
was
an
amazing
beer
more
of
a
barleywine
than
a
traditional
black
tan
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
it
that
said
i
paid
8
00
for
a
single
bottle
im
not
too
sure
about
that
element
of
this
scotsdanish
brew
d
as
far
as
bottled
black
tans
go
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
of
the
sugary
sweetness
on
the
palate
but
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
stuff
i
also
liked
this
a
ton
better
than
the
individual
components
its
easy
to
want
to
pull
the
beer
apart
and
form
impressions
on
the
stout
portions
as
separate
from
the
ipa
portions
but
together
we
get
the
appreciation
of
both
worlds
yet
it
can
be
argued
that
we
get
best
of
neither
tasty
definitely
worth
checking
out
but
you
certainly
pay
for
it
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
teku
semiproper
poured
a
massively
dark
red
brown
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
subtle
coffee
dark
fruit
subtle
citrus
subtle
citrus
hop
alcohol
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
coffee
dark
fruit
earth
earth
hop
citrus
citrus
hop
and
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
have
had
a
few
black
tan
brews
back
before
i
was
reviewing
beers
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
if
i
am
honest
the
stout
portion
of
this
brew
definitely
dominated
this
one
with
all
the
roastiness
and
alcohol
notes
the
tan
portion
did
make
itself
known
throughout
though
with
a
nice
kiss
of
citrus
to
help
balance
it
out
i
could
honestly
see
this
one
getting
you
in
quite
a
bit
of
trouble
if
you
are
not
careful
definitely
a
better
representation
of
the
style
and
definitely
better
than
the
makeshift
one
a
few
of
us
in
my
tasting
group
made
worth
your
time
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
yin
yang
is
a
fantastic
black
tan
though
it
could
just
as
well
be
a
black
ipa
i
will
have
to
make
an
effort
to
get
a
bottle
of
both
yin
and
yang
and
see
what
a
home
blend
tastes
like
if
you
like
yuengling
black
and
tan
give
this
a
try
its
a
step
above
would
definitely
drink
again
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
o
just
about
dead
on
for
a
light
porter
easy
drinking
pours
flat
dark
brown
very
good
reminds
me
of
the
deans
beans
a
bit
lighter
ive
always
liked
berkshire
brewing
company
theyve
made
some
great
beers
but
when
i
see
them
this
is
always
the
one
i
go
for
the
appearance
is
a
little
thin
mostly
a
darkish
brown
with
a
light
head
but
the
smell
disproves
that
and
shows
the
beer
to
have
nice
hop
and
malt
in
it
the
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
light
flavor
in
the
beginning
with
sweet
malt
and
almost
coffee
flavors
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
for
a
company
that
makes
a
lot
of
good
stuff
there
always
seems
to
be
one
or
two
of
these
guys
in
the
fridge
with
everything
else
ill
have
to
try
it
again
o
pretty
tasty
stuff
bbc
is
very
consistent
with
their
brews
and
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
oddecent
as
far
as
a
black
tan
goes
this
one
is
pretty
legit
but
its
still
nothing
to
fawn
over
just
a
mostly
sweet
brew
with
both
porter
and
pale
characteristics
wouldnt
buy
this
again
o
my
first
of
the
style
but
i
imagine
its
at
the
top
of
the
list
well
done
beer
thats
fresh
fun
and
easy
to
drink
first
forray
into
the
black
and
tan
reviewing
and
i
think
this
is
a
good
one
very
easy
drinking
with
a
good
relative
flavor
thanks
r94uconn
overall
nice
beer
to
pair
with
food
but
it
wont
really
blow
your
mind
on
its
own
o
great
dessert
beer
probably
would
go
well
with
breakfast
too
not
complex
but
very
enjoyable
i
will
have
to
try
more
of
berkshires
portersstouts
sampled
on
april
7
2012
at
the
annual
keene
nh
beerfest
a
fundraiser
for
youth
hockey
this
had
a
lovely
mahogany
amber
brown
pour
with
ruby
red
highlights
the
nose
is
entirely
sweet
with
caramel
malts
and
a
little
cocoa
due
to
the
porter
influence
the
body
was
medium
the
taste
was
bountiful
with
sweet
caramel
malts
but
the
porter
half
of
this
black
tan
is
not
quite
as
evident
in
the
flavor
still
a
decent
likable
beer
o
böring
im
gonna
stop
trying
bbcs
lighter
offerings
and
stick
to
their
porters
and
stouts
reminiscent
of
a
mild
porter
i
enjoyed
this
one
courtesy
of
a
ba
beer
trade
malty
with
mild
hops
some
roast
flavors
little
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
dark
beer
with
a
wet
middle
and
no
noticeable
alcohol
presence
not
hoppy
solidly
good
just
not
great
it
is
worth
drinking
id
definitely
drink
it
again
o
to
me
this
beer
was
just
ok
it
wasnt
bad
but
nothing
that
really
makes
me
want
more
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
but
not
really
worth
hunting
down
to
me
really
nice
beer
here
from
berkshire
gives
black
and
tans
a
good
name
cheers
chris
and
gary
o
good
beer
i
like
the
combo
and
it
drinks
very
smooth
o
yet
another
great
beer
from
the
bbc
lineup
very
happy
that
they
are
local
and
i
can
enjoy
these
great
beers
fresh
this
is
a
blend
of
the
draymans
porter
and
the
berkshire
ale
any
combination
of
their
solid
beers
is
a
winner
in
my
book
an
excellant
beer
with
strong
chocolate
aroma
that
hits
you
even
before
you
drink
it
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
very
dense
blackness
that
seems
like
a
black
hole
where
no
light
will
penetrate
once
you
take
a
swallow
you
definitely
know
why
black
holes
are
dense
this
very
thick
beer
tastes
like
a
very
thick
belgian
chocolate
shake
had
this
beer
at
the
scuffer
steak
ale
house
in
burlington
vt
drinkability
this
is
a
great
member
of
the
berkshire
lineup
they
have
created
something
unique
and
tasty
out
of
two
very
solid
beers
the
fruity
malts
of
the
traditional
pale
ale
are
highlighted
and
complimented
nicely
by
the
draymans
porters
dark
roasty
character
solid
o
quite
nice
lots
of
malt
going
on
here
really
no
hops
not
a
fast
drinker
but
an
interesting
departure
from
most
of
the
normal
beers
out
there
cheers
o
overall
this
was
a
treat
to
drink
my
first
black
and
tan
the
label
says
it
is
a
blend
of
their
berkshire
pale
ale
and
their
draymans
porter
i
feel
they
pulled
it
off
wonderfully
i
could
easily
knock
back
several
of
these
in
a
setting
well
done
d
high
no
real
alcohol
taste
at
all
i
can
drink
this
one
all
night
overall
a
good
black
and
tan
that
stays
unique
this
is
really
bad
to
the
point
of
not
being
drinkable
big
time
pass
for
me
overall
good
as
everything
ive
tried
from
bbc
has
been
but
not
offthecharts
good
like
their
lost
sailor
ipa
i
think
its
like
this
some
beer
is
just
better
on
tap
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
for
example
is
phenomenal
on
tap
but
surprisingly
average
out
of
the
bottle
i
think
shabadoo
might
be
a
better
ontap
beer
too
so
next
time
i
guess
ill
just
buy
a
keg
instead
hey
i
quite
enjoyed
this
and
could
drink
it
all
the
time
drinkability
is
fair
with
some
stickyness
on
the
finish
no
real
booze
a
bit
of
sweetness
some
light
bitterness
and
herbal
earthiness
beer
is
pretty
light
in
body
and
easy
drinking
there
is
some
mild
bitterness
at
the
back
from
the
roasted
grain
but
not
from
hops
the
overall
herbal
and
hop
character
is
practically
absent
this
beer
screams
for
some
hop
character
but
its
not
there
bo
erall
its
an
ok
beer
from
a
fiction
style
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
again
but
i
wouldnt
bother
buying
it
again
poured
this
4
bomber
into
a
sam
adams
glass
with
an
awesome
three
finger
head
this
then
disapates
to
a
solid
half
finger
head
with
bubbles
streaming
from
the
bottom
holding
a
nice
small
cap
the
while
time
smells
of
sweet
carmel
slight
chocolate
and
toffee
faint
roasted
smell
tastes
of
carmel
and
chocolate
great
transition
of
flavor
sweet
and
mellow
to
a
slight
bitterness
with
some
vanilla
somewhere
in
there
highly
drinkable
for
a
6
5
abv
id
buy
this
again
for
this
price
d
really
nice
black
and
tan
bottled
locally
makes
it
a
great
fresh
brew
encore
very
drinkable
overall
a
one
and
done
bomber
easy
to
drink
but
cream
and
cocoa
will
get
old
after
22
oz
very
decent
d
very
drinkable
not
terribly
exciting
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
all
in
all
this
is
a
surprising
beer
it
was
much
better
than
expected
i
might
buy
this
brew
again
definitely
try
if
you
like
the
style
and
i
think
everyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
way
to
go
berkshire
this
could
be
dealt
as
a
porter
but
the
thin
body
and
easydrinking
manner
would
give
it
away
pretty
easily
dry
roasted
husk
malts
blend
with
a
sweet
grainyness
from
the
pale
ale
to
give
this
one
an
uncommonly
smooth
mouthfeel
there
is
more
than
enough
hops
to
dry
out
the
finish
and
they
even
provide
a
nice
bit
of
floralherbaceous
flavor
slight
astringency
is
the
only
issue
i
have
with
this
beer
and
that
is
very
minor
pretty
nice
brew
here
and
easily
the
best
black
tan
i
have
had
recommended
for
sure
d
hard
to
believe
this
is
6
3
no
hint
of
alcohol
and
this
is
just
a
smooth
easy
beer
character
of
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
identity
i
dont
know
its
plenty
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
really
hit
the
spot
its
a
worthy
beer
but
just
wouldnt
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
goto
beers
purchased
a
bomber

into
standard
pint
glasses
dark
brown
color
thick
white
head
nice
surge
of
carbonation
at
the
top
good
amount
of
lacing
smell
was
a
bit
like
milky
coffee
taste
was
of
chocolate
and
subtle
roasted
coffee
beans
flavors
came
off
to
me
as
a
lot
like
a
smooth
porter
mouthfeel
was
nice
it
was
silky
and
smooth
abv
is
hidden
well
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
or
on
nitro
d
very
high
tasty
and
pretty
low
alcohol
at
6
5
d
soo
easy
to
drink
would
have
guessed
a
much
lower
abv
love
this
on
tap
only
had
it
in
a
bottle
once
a
couple
years
ago
pretty
good
beer
although
tough
to
compare
to
anything
else
since
it
is
somewhat
of
a
limited
style
pours
out
an
extremely
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
the
head
is
pretty
creamy
and
light
tan
in
color
with
decent
retention
some
medium
lacing
is
left
behind
as
i
drink
this
one
smell
is
very
very
weak
i
just
pick
up
some
faint
roasted
malts
and
thats
about
it
even
when
i
smell
the
bottle
its
strange
considering
the
taste
this
is
one
of
the
weirdest
tasting
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
might
be
too
warm
but
i
dont
think
so
lots
of
good
roasted
malts
definitely
some
earthy
hops
some
alcohol
some
rye
like
grains
the
balance
is
pretty
well
done
some
sweets
in
there
too
mouthfeel
is
moderate
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
for
the
style
and
some
alcohol
warming
not
sure
about
drinkability
here
the
flavors
are
starting
to
get
a
bit
too
much
after
my
first
glass
of
the
bomber
the
price
was
great
but
im
not
sure
i
will
be
having
this
one
again
simple
beer
one
to
really
enjoy
without
thinking
about
very
much
cheers
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
a
good
specimen
of
this
style
premixed
and
in
bottles
which
i
subsequently
sampled
as
well
so
i
am
always
a
little
skeptical
this
one
however
knocked
my
socks
off
it
poured
dark
but
settled
out
lighter
towards
the
bottom
with
a
decent
head
all
pretty
surprising
the
smell
included
cocoa
roasted
malt
coffee
caramel
toffee
and
vanilla
and
the
taste
was
an
excellent
balance
of
all
of
these
flavors
i
was
super
impressed
the
feel
was
creamy
yet
not
overpowering
so
as
to
allow
sessioning
a
very
pleasant
surprise
overall
pours
dark
brown
and
gets
a
bit
lighter
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
almost
as
though
it
was
blended
off
the
tap
smells
like
both
a
porter
and
a
lager
as
crisp
as
a
nose
gets
the
taste
is
consistent
all
the
way
through
some
coffee
or
perhaps
chocolate
flavor
and
some
lagerish
paleness
if
you
will
the
mouthfeel
starts
off
smooth
and
becomes
very
crisp
as
it
goes
on
to
the
finish
goes
down
so
smooth
and
easy
in
my
humble
opinion
the
best
bottled
black
tan
out
there
even
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
syrupy
finish
warms
the
cheeks
drinkability
in
a
bottle
or
on
the
tap
probably
the
best
representation
of
a
black
and
tan
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
having
berkshire
blends
two
beers
correctly
into
one
without
throwing
you
to
one
side
malt
lovers
and
even
hop
lovers
can
rejoice
at
last
the
picture
perfect
blend
of
what
a
black
and
tan
should
be
and
at
3
50
a
bomber
you
can
save
a
trip
to
the
bar
and
having
a
nasty
bt
made
by
some
moron
who
probably
drinks
coors
anyway
recommended
thanks
to
brothercannon
for
bringing
this
back
from
vt
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
shabadoo
appears
a
translucent
deep
chestnut
color
with
at
least
two
fingers
of
creamy
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
medium
roasted
grains
earthy
bitter
hops
slightly
nutty
both
milk
and
dark
chocolates
caramelized
malts
and
a
touch
of
mild
coffee
as
it
warms
the
ale
is
approaching
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
finish
is
bittersweet
great
stuff
thanks
again

notes

with

quite
drinkable
drinkability
excellent
beer
balanced
from
start
to
finish
with
a
taste
that
lingers
for
the
right
amount
of
time
not
a
strong
beer
in
flavor
but
it
excels
over
a
wide
spectrum
easy
to
drink
and
very
smooth
just
had
this
on
tap
at
cambridge
house
brew
pub
earlier
tonight
i
was
disappointed
they
still
arent
brewing
yet
but
it
gave
me
a
change
to
try
this
great
beer
ive
only
had
a
couple
black
and
tans
before
saranac
and
mississipi
mud
and
this
one
is
far
better
i
cant
believe
its
ipa
level
abv
wise
taste
was
so
damn
smooth
lots
of
flavors
for
your
palette
to
wander
around
and
just
good
overall
overall
a
better
than
average
brew
but
nothing
really
remarkable
the
taste
is
somewhat
creamy
it
has
a
nice
roasted
slightly
charred
caramel
maltiness
there
is
a
particular
hop
bite
to
the
beer
that
is
a
bit
strong
for
what
would
normally
be
a
stout
or
porter
the
dark
part
the
hoppy
bite
comes
from
the
tan
part
of
this
duo
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
there
is
a
definite
abv
presence
that
compromises
an
otherwise
decent
beer
there
is
a
tinge
of
the
abv
throatiness
that
just
shouldnt
be
there
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
fairly
low
carbonation
not
bad
not
my
favorite
berkshire
either
d
the
bt
style
is
tough
to
pin
down
the
flavors
dont
set
the
world
aflame
but
they
rarely
disappoint
this
is
nice
and
average
typical
bbc
bomber
pours
dark
amber
dark
tan
head
typical
retention
and
then
just
a
hint
of
lace
to
be
found
light
cola
nose
notes
of
vanilla
amber
grains
some
more
light
cola
sort
of
unexciting
in
a
middle
of
the
road
sort
of
way
just
kinda
bland
so
so
brown
ale
or
a
watery
porter
would
do
as
a
sessioner
or
marinade
pours
a
clear
and
pretty
dark
brown
with
a
creme
head
the
nose
is
nutty
flavor
brings
much
of
the
same
nice
nutty
and
mild
earthy
tones
overall
sweetness
is
there
as
well
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
carbonation
is
appropriate
it
seems
black
tan
sure
okay
might
as
well
be
a
brown
ale
to
me
and
a
tasty
one
at
that
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
the
color
of
cola
with
a
slightly
lighter
consistency
to
the
pour
quarter
inch
offwhite
cap
speckled
with
copious
ringlets
clarity
is
poor
some
light
penetration
and
translucency
when
backlit
some
lacing
but
weak
legs
picked
up
some
pale
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
as
roasted
coffee
and
a
light
fruity
ester
towards
the
back
taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
some
mild
hops
bittering
detectable
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
between
light
and
medium
with
carbonation
that
provides
a
slight
burn
across
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
roof
of
the
mouth
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
with
a
good
body
and
cant
beat
the
price
i
typically
dont
care
for
bottled
black
and
tans
but
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
the
feel
is
more
lagery
than
porterystouty
its
creamy
but
not
superthick
the
taste
is
good
but
a
little
slight
doesnt
quite
commit
to
either
side
and
though
its
fine
it
feels
like
it
skimped
out
a
tad
sampled
this
cask
pulled
version
on
tap
while
hiding
from
the
summer
heat
in
american
flatbread
a
decent
khaki
head
topped
this
brew
and
fizzed
away
after
few
minutes
to
a
clingy
ring
moderate
lacing
the
liquid
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
that
appeared
against
sunlight
the
nose
was
toffee
and
maple
the
flavors
were
quite
enjoyable
sweet
like
caramel
at
first
almost
like
an
alcoholic
root
beer
then
some
alcohol
esters
come
through
followed
by
some
subtle
vanilla
roasted
malt
then
a
bit
of
semisweet
chocolate
think
nestle
chocolate
chips
just
before
the
long
coffee
finish
distinctly
layered
flavors
and
quite
complex
reminds
me
of
a
fortified
wine
or
a
bourbon
especially
as
it
warmed
up
very
light
carbonation
but
thats
the
casking
and
smooth
for
the
same
reasons
challenging
and
enjoyable
a
good
black
and
tan
mix
but
not
the
best
ive
had
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
at
times
but
still
went
down
smooth
i
still
prefer
dirty
penny
or
mississippi
mud
or
just
a
real
black
and
tan
in
a
pub
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
fluffy
tanwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
lace
down
the
entire
glass
aroma
is
of
coffee
toffee
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
nice
smelling
beer
taste
is
malty
chocolate
toffee
and
coffee
with
some
slight
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thin
carbonation
is
ample
great
tasting
easy
drinking
brew
tastes
and
smells
great
overall
i
think
beers
like
this
are
sort
of
gimmicky
im
not
sure
this
is
a
true
black
and
tan
it
tastes
more
like
a
brown
ale
with
some
malt
changes
to
it
still
a
fine
beer
from
a
good
brewing
company
amazingly
smooth
and
creamy
liquid
velvet
had
to
shake
the
bottle
and
check
for
the
widget
when
i
was
finished
wasnt
in
there
just
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
to
me
anytime
of
the
year
not
and
extreme
beer
in
anywayjust
sooo
smooth
it
has
to
be
admired
pours
sort
of
a
murky
chestnut
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
a
ton
of
lacing
roasty
coffee
notes
with
a
bit
of
fresh
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
of
coffee
grounds
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
i
love
bbc
and
im
glad
i
got
to
around
to
trying
this
one
but
not
my
favorite
berkshire
brew
its
very
smooth
there
is
a
subtle
sweetness
that
leaves
quickly
the
bite
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
creamy
feel
to
it
the
head
laces
the
glass
nicely
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
red
tint
to
it
with
a
tall
and
medium
bodied
tan
colored
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
before
settling
it
laces
the
glass
very
nicely
on
the
way
down
the
aroma
is
of
deep
roasted
malts
and
sweeter
toasted
ones
underneath
some
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
is
the
same
as
well
nice
mix
of
malts
that
give
it
a
bittersweet
base
underneath
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
rounded
off
by
a
nice
but
slight
hoppy
bitterness
really
nice
black
and
tan
the
mouthfeel
was
very
crisp
and
warming
which
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
unique
appearance
kind
of
muddy
and
murky
looking
medium
offwhite
head
soft
aroma
mostly
consisting
of
sweet
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
had
a
little
more
complexety
to
it
medium
bodied
with
roasted
malt
and
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
a
satisfying
beer
thats
dark
but
not
too
heavy
bbc
does
it
again
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
i
want
another

coffee
with
a
touch
of
tart

and
a

very
drinkable
but
may
be
a
bit
sour
to
some
tastes
medium
to
thin
feel
pretty
lively
carbonation
nothing
exciting
but
well
worth
a
try
berkshire
is
gaining
my
respect
with
each
new
try
this
is
a
nicely
done
and
tasty
blacktan
from
berkshire
that
combines
the
best
characteristics
from
both
their
porter
and
pale
ale
its
great
to
see
more
craft
brewers
releasing
this
style
lately
pours
dark
brown
and
gets
a
bit
lighter
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
almost
as
though
it
was
blended
off
the
tap
smells
like
both
a
porter
and
a
lager
as
crisp
as
a
nose
gets
the
taste
is
consistent
all
the
way
through
some
coffee
or
perhaps
chocolate
flavor
and
some
lagerish
paleness
if
you
will
the
mouthfeel
starts
off
smooth
and
becomes
very
crisp
as
it
goes
on
to
the
finish
goes
down
so
so
smooth
and
easy
in
my
humble
opinion
the
best
blacktan
out
there
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
ruby
tints
around
the
glass
fizzy
head
quickly
dissipates
the
nose
is
of
dark
porter
malts
and
euro
lager
funk
smooth
taste
tastes
like
a
very
subtle
porter
can
taste
the
dark
malts
of
a
porter
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
twinge
thin
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
an
excellent
session
brew
from
berkshire
this
beer
is
the
first
one
to
impress
me
in
a
while
smells
mostly
chocolate
but
the
taste
is
very
heavy
on
the
malts
all
around
great
full
bodied
beer
for
relaxing
in
the
winter
time
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
good
but
i
dont
know
how
much
of
these
i
could
drink
in
a
night
i
would
wait
and
get
this
done
by
a
bartender
in
front
of
you
thats
the
only
reason
i
dont
think
this
deserves
to
have
too
much
of
a
high
rating
a
clean
dark
copper
colored
beer
has
a
large
beige
head
with
some
lace
the
is
a
nice
soft
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
more
like
an
ale
than
a
porter
there
is
a
very
light
tea
like
hop
prescence
in
the
background
has
a
nice
easy
finish
and
is
a
nice
easy
drink
tasty
and
very
drinkable
just
needed
a
bit
more
malt
push
to
notch
this
up
another
ladder
step
it
poured
out
with
a
very
thick
head
with
a
nice
dark
brown
color
in
appearance
it
does
kinda
resemble
some
artificial
quasiblack
and
tan
with
a
sweet
syrupcaramel
taste
and
smell
it
furthers
its
name
credibility
a
really
nice
presence
deep
and
creamy
overall
another
great
creation
from
western
mass
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
twofinger
head
aroma
is
rich
and
roasty
as
well
as
malty
taste
is
once
again
leaning
more
towards
the
stout
even
though
the
lager
or
is
it
ale
shows
through
just
as
well
here
smooth
clean
finish
with
all
the
roastiness
of
a
stout
easy
to
mistake
this
one
for
a
schwartzbier
very
drinkable
and
a
very
good
example
of
its
style
a
decent
brew
with
some
reserved
flavors
but
a
very
nice
smooth
texture
pleasant
but
nothing
exciting
about
the
shabadoo
pours
a
nice
head
with
good
retention
and
the
lacing
looks
very
good
as
well
the
color
is
light
black
and
brown
smell
is
a
little
sweet
roastiness
almost
like
a
baltic
porter
only
not
overpowering
with
sweetness
the
taste
is
light
and
clean
i
can
pick
up
the
slight
roastiness
in
the
aftertaste
with
some
lagerlike
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
and
fizzy
overall
it
was
good
to
try
but
i
dont
think
i
would
have
this
right
away
too
many
other
beers
out
there
this
wasnt
bad
pours
with
a
dark
nutty
body
and
a
finebubbled
head
that
leaves
a
dusting
and
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
lightly
dusty
vanillainflected
malts
with
an
indistinct
creaminess
but
its
a
light
rather
lackluster
aroma
on
the
palate
stout
sourness
starts
things
off
then
some
roasted
malt
astringency
creeps
in
by
the
midpalate
the
finish
is
robustly
bitter
with
a
bit
of
a
claylike
earthy
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
overcarbonated
and
a
bit
acidic
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
special
in
any
way
can
you
get
a
premixed
black
and
tan
on
draught
that
would
amuse
me
i
would
very
much
enjoy
sipping
on
this
as
a
dessert
beer
recommended
if
a
little
sweetness
doesnt
turn
you
off
smells
like
creamy
coffee
yummy
also
a
serious
whoppers
thing
going
on
in
the
smell
and
the
flavor
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
yummy
theres
some
other
stuff
going
on
in
here
vanilla
citrus
earthy
hops
it
tastes
nice
extra
creamy
this
is
a
real
good
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
on
the
sweet
side
it
goes
down
real
easy
all
in
all
very
drinkable
and
recommended
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogony
with
a
large
tan
foamy
head
the
smell
is
light
with
coffeesweet
maltchocolateand
cola
the
taste
is
like
a
portercoffeechocolateroasted
malt
and
some
hops
not
badbut
stilli
would
like
a
black
and
tan
better
poured
at
a
bar
the
mf
is
medium
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
not
a
bad
beer
from
one
of
new
englands
better
breweries
i
really
dig
this
brew
something
about
it
just
reminds
me
of
the
autumns
and
winters
i
spent
living
in
new
england
go
figure
since
its
brewed
in
ma
and
while
theres
that
bit
of
nostalgia
there
with
this
one
the
overall
flavour
and
presentation
of
it
makes
it
just
as
enjoyable
without
said
nostalgia
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
berkshires
a
treat
for
sure
and
well
worth
sampling
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
with
a
dark
brown
color
and
nice
two
finger
head
that
held
well
and
a
nice
lace
to
the
finish
smell
is
coffee
and
caramel
taste
is
same
but
the
coffee
comes
through
without
any
bitterness
mouthfeel
all
malt
smoothness
with
a
clean
light
body
and
no
after
taste
i
dont
think
you
will
find
to
many
people
who
would
not
like
this
beer
overall
my
first
sip
or
2
were
slighty
disappointing
but
the
beer
really
impressed
me
about
6
or
7
sips
in
very
flavorful
smooth
and
enjoyable
i
agree
with
doomcifer
when
he
says
its
like
a
really
heavy
brown
ale
this
is
a
fairly
good
black
tan
its
pretty
good
except
for
the
metallic
taste
i
would
recommend
trying
it
at
least
once
brew
pours
to
a
dark
brown
color
hedging
on
black
with
redamber
highlights
has
a
nice
sized
tan
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
whole
glass
the
aroma
of
this
brew
reminds
me
of
coffee
very
sweet
malts
and
a
delicate
alcohol
scent
the
first
thing
that
i
notice
is
the
creamy
texture
on
the
tongue
that
is
mixed
with
a
sweet
flavor
from
the
malt
think
it
would
be
from
the
malt
the
sweetness
is
actually
a
little
subdued
from
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
aroma
i
am
also
picking
up
a
deep
roast
to
a
burnt
flavor
also
from
the
malt
also
in
the
middle
there
is
a
nice
hop
bitterness
that
is
carried
through
the
end
leaving
a
nice
aftertaste
over
all
this
is
a
great
brew
like
the
roasted
flavors
mixed
with
the
hop
bite
as
they
complement
each
other
very
well
also
it
is
had
to
believe
that
this
brew
is
at
6
3
abv
as
with
most
of
the
bbc
brews
it
does
not
drink
like
a
brew
of
this
high
abv
it
doesnt
have
that
special
layering
effect
that
it
does
on
draft
obviously
but
is
still
an
attractive
brew
i
cannot
say
enough
about
the
mouthfeel
though
superb
on
that
end
overall
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
them
cooler
autumn
sundays
watching
your
favorite
football
team
in
my
case
go
pats
very
drinkable
id
certainly
suggest
picking
it
up
next
time
you
find
one
da
a
very
drinkable
black
and
tan
d
this
one
is
very
tasty
especially
if
youre
into
the
malty
sweetness
its
kind
of
filling
so
its
definitely
a
sipper
despite
an
abv
that
is
only
in
the
6
range
one
thing
of
note
on
this
beer
is
its
beautiful
appearence
dark
caramel
coloring
and
nice
thick
head
not
much
of
a
smell
however
notes
of
roasted
barley
and
crystal
malts
are
present
it
tastes
great
however
it
seems
there
is
clearly
more
black
than
tan
almost
tasting
similar
to
a
porter
normal
mouthfeel
nothing
special
with
a
clean
finish
its
good
and
i
will
drink
the
entire
bomber
it
came
in
however
i
could
not
make
this
a
session
beer
good
take
on
the
style
had
it
on
draft
at
the
cambridge
house
in
granby
ct
this
past
friday
i
was
most
impressed
by
its
smoothness
maybe
a
bit
more
hops
in
the
finish
though
appearance
was
more
on
the
black
side
with
no
real
telltale
aroma
notes
another
great
achivement
from
my
favorite
american
brewery
thanks
to
jim
for
this
one
poured
out
a
nice
dark
ruby
dark
brownish
color
strong
malty
smell
with
light
roasted
smell
had
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
mixed
in
there
thick
creamy
tanish
head
looked
nice
but
did
not
last
for
too
long
nice
lacing
of
the
glass
though
smooth
nutty
roasted
flavor
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
had
a
hoppy
touch
to
it
that
was
quite
enjoyable
and
pleasent
in
my
mouth
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nice
smooth
flavor
well
blended
varieties
of
flavor
good
offering
from
start
to
finish
good
overall
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
drinability
was
high
not
generally
a
big
fan
of
the
bt
but
this
was
a
very
nice
hybrid
mix
and
a
really
solid
drinking
brew
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
a
bomber
but
thats
probably
because
there
arent
any
outstanding
or
unusual
traits
typically
im
not
a
fan
of
bottled
black
tans
because
they
do
not
have
the
same
effect
of
the
light
lager
and
dark
stout
layering
that
is
present
from
a
tap
pour
however
this
should
not
detract
from
this
flavorful
brew
as
this
is
simply
an
excellent
beer
the
taste
has
the
breakfast
tea
the
maltiness
the
caramel
just
what
im
hoping
for
in
a
black
and
tan
mediumheavy
bodied
strong
carbonation
not
too
strong
though
refreshing
the
flavor
builds
with
more
ambitious
sips
and
a
few
rolls
across
the
tongue
this
one
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
complexity
it
is
what
it
is
and
that
is
a
very
respectable
fact
about
it
not
an
overly
popular
beer
i
have
had
it
on
tap
too
not
sure
about
the
freshness
on
tap
the
one
i
had
ask
your
bar
tender
how
fresh
it
is
ruddy
brown
with
a
slowly
dissipating
head
which
could
stand
to
be
more
plentiful
smell
is
wonderful
caramel
coffee
rich
porter
smells
mint
cloves
pine
pot
an
incredibly
complex
chocolate
and
a
hoppy
base
all
shine
on
first
taste
malts
are
smooth
without
bitters
probably
due
to
the
mixing
and
filling
tastes
better
this
second
time
around
only
problem
is
the
carbonation
which
feels
like
although
it
imparts
flavor
as
it
passes
is
also
powerfully
bloating
and
makes
the
body
thinner
than
need
be
on
the
other
hand
it
allows
for
excellent
drinkability
which
in
turn
brings
out
the
peppermint
and
marijuana
flavors
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
awesome
brewery
nice
fairly
dark
leathery
brown
color
very
clear
though
not
much
head
to
speak
of
smells
malty
and
a
touch
sweet
with
a
nice
subtle
piney
hop
kick
taste
is
pretty
similar
nice
hop
bitterness
in
the
end
matches
the
malty
body
well
for
some
reason
though
this
beer
doesnt
quite
click
with
me
it
seems
to
be
sort
of
flat
not
meaning
no
carbonation
and
uninteresting
no
real
challenging
flavors
jump
out
at
me
and
it
doesnt
really
strike
me
as
a
black
and
tan
i
dont
really
trust
black
and
tans
out
of
the
bottle
anyway
it
tastes
more
like
a
brown
ale
or
something
but
a
struggling
one
anyway
a
decent
try
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
from
bbc
as
i
usually
love
their
stuff
might
be
worth
a
try
to
someone
else
very
drinakable
warming
and
refreshing
i
will
seek
this
one
out
in
boston
in
early
2005
cant
wait
bomber
bottle
as
advertised
a
mix
of
stout
and
pale
ale
characteristics
pours
a
nice
stoutlike
creamy
head
odor
is
stoutish
too
but
with
the
fruity
characteristic
of
a
pale
ale
taste
predominates
with
stout
notes
roasty
and
smoky
but
the
pale
ale
side
contributes
fruity
esters
and
some
sherry
and
cherry
notes
its
description
would
suggest
a
porter
but
its
not
quite
one
of
those
perhaps
needs
to
be
a
style
of
its
own
reflection
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
black
and
tans
in
a
bottle
but
this
beer
might
be
the
one
that
changes
my
mind
great
on
a
fall
afternoon
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
imho
drinkabilityi
would
say
very
goodits
especially
nice
this
time
of
yearfall
and
i
would
certainly
buy
it
again
22
oz
bottle
this
is
a
pretty
descent
black
tan
pours
a
nice
dark
color
there
was
a
very
small
head
smell
was
nothing
special
with
a
faint
hint
of
hops
and
malt
taste
is
pretty
good
a
nice
mixture
of
sweet
malt
and
bitterness
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
this
beer
should
be
enjoyed
just
above
room
temperature
when
it
is
cold
the
flavor
does
not
emerge
probably
the
best
of
the
bottled
black
and
tans
enjoy
wyll
medium
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
dark
brown
appearance
small
head
with
minor
lacing
light
malty
aroma
tasted
a
bit
like
a
dark
lager
imho
slight
coffe
notes
sweet
with
a
light
tartness
at
the
finish
somewhat
chewy
in
the
mouthfeel
with
a
lack
of
overall
smoothness
not
as
good
as
others
ive
had
by
them
notes
this
has
to
be
the
best
bottled
black
and
tan
i
have
had
to
date
so
drinkable
and
the
6
3
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
very
versatile
have
it
around
for
game
time
as
a
session
brew
or
pair
it
with
a
chocolate
dessert
either
way
this
one
is
a
winner
in
my
book
tastes
of
caramel
malt
tastes
malty
sweet
very
sweet
and
tastes
a
bit
of
candy
corn
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
lingering
this
is
ok
but
it
does
not
quite
do
it
for
me
too
syrupy
sweet
and
malty
for
me
not
very
balanced
for
my
tastes
even
for
a
black
and
tan
pours
out
brown
with
a
short
head
tastes
a
bit
like
stout
tastes
a
bit
like
pale
ale
thus
the
black
and
tan
not
as
good
as
a
real
poured
black
and
tan
but
a
well
blended
brew
the
balance
is
quite
nice
good
mouthfeel
and
flavor
worth
a
sample
personally
i
dont
know
how
you
can
bottle
and
label
something
as
a
black
tan
it
lacks
the
skillful
pour
and
visible
seperation
achieved
at
bars
this
aside
i
found
the
offering
to
be
very
drinkable
smooth
malty
and
leaning
towards
the
sweet
side
like
their
other
brews
im
not
a
big
fan
of
bottled
black
tans
and
this
one
failed
to
change
my
views
this
one
was
kind
of
like
a
dark
brown
ale
with
an
overuse
of
hops
and
strong
aftertaste
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
totally
disappointed
o
overall
this
was
not
my
favourite
shabadoo
offering
from
berkshire
still
not
bad
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
variation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
flavorful
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
NA
sampled
at
the
brewpub
this
is
their
fall
seasonal
for
2006
the
name
means
mixed
but
it
is
not
mixed
at
the
bar
but
rather
brewed
as
a
mix
of
pale
and
dark
it
comes
out
a
cloudy
dark
amber
under
a
1
5
finger
beige
head
with
goor
creamy
body
and
a
few
lace
strings
the
nose
is
very
mild
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
the
mouth
is
light
and
very
prickly
mild
all
around
but
all
elements
are
here
caramel
sweet
roasted
nut
floral
hops
that
leave
a
slightly
dry
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
while
i
want
more
of
all
of
the
above
it
is
a
good
drinkable
brew
with
wide
appeal
certainly
solid
poured
mahogany
brown
with
less
than
a
finger
of
beige
head
poor
retention
and
spotty
lacing
like
the
ale
brewed
by
this
company
very
sweet
in
the
nose
with
milk
chocolate
dominating
the
taste
was
similar
but
also
detected
a
hint
of
earthiness
and
cocoa
powder
and
a
semisweet
finish
thinner
than
expected
but
this
was
again
a
little
hidden
mentally
by
the
overall
sweetness
of
the
brew
pours
deep
brown
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
falls
quickly
with
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
pleasantly
chocolate
and
roasted
though
there
is
a
faint
whiff
of
the
mass
produced
behind
it
the
flavor
is
decent
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
roasted
porterlike
character
and
a
backbone
of
palemaltbased
ale
there
is
some
mild
hop
character
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
this
is
clearly
not
a
carefullycrafted
microbrew
but
it
is
certainly
better
than
one
would
expect
from
pabst
and
clearly
better
than
similar
offerings
from
the
equivalent
michelob
craft
brew
line
the
mouthfeel
is
slight
though
there
is
a
bit
of
cling
that
keeps
the
roasted
character
in
the
mouth
longer
than
youd
expect
unfortunately
the
overall
product
is
marked
by
that
indefinable
sourness
late
on
the
finish
that
afflicts
many
mass
market
american
beers
mouthfeeldrinkability
active
right
away
becoming
more
and
more
carbonated
and
finally
gassy
to
the
point
of
being
bothersome
a
poor
attempt
at
the
style
and
a
rather
weak
offering
from
pabst
d
ok
drinkability
but
unimpressive
mouthfeel
and
taste
hurt
this
one
a
little
easier
to
handle
but
i
was
not
dying
for
a
second
beer
after
the
first
d
overall
impression
a
moderate
beer
decent
flavor
but
nothing
to
exciting
here
this
is
a
run
of
the
mill
brew
at
best
no
huge
flaws
save
for
a
slightly
sub
par
mouthfeel
but
just
nothing
beyond
average
going
on
here
really
this
one
might
work
in
a
pinch
if
youre
on
a
strict
budget
but
id
look
elsewhere
for
something
with
more
flavour
first
time
i
have
ever
given
mcsorleys
a
try
it
poured
to
a
dark
brown
color
hedging
on
black
with
a
nice
sized
light
tan
head
that
breaks
down
quite
quickly
but
did
leave
some
lacing
down
the
side
the
aroma
seems
nice
but
light
slight
roasted
malts
some
chocolate
smell
come
out
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
breaks
apart
in
my
opinion
very
watery
some
malt
flavors
but
a
metallic
flavor
that
seems
to
be
very
prominent
but
not
a
good
flavor
overall
this
is
a
ok
beer
at
best
has
some
character
but
based
on
the
black
and
tan
offering
from
saranac
this
just
does
not
cut
it
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brownnear
black
hue
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
relatively
quickly
very
little
lacing
was
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
strong
malts
and
slight
yeast
the
taste
is
bitter
and
malty
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
might
turn
off
some
although
the
bottle
says
85
stout15
lager
there
are
not
too
many
stout
characteristics
to
this
beer
that
said
it
is
pretty
robust
and
fairly
smooth
which
makes
it
drinkability
high
in
my
opinion
id
enjoy
having
this
with
a
plate
of
wings
and
watching
a
game
with
friends
at
5
99
for
a
sixpack
this
might
be
the
most
affordable
strong
beer
to
get
for
your
money
overall
not
horrible
but
not
what
it
is
advertised
to
be
either
had
a
nice
setup
but
just
nothing
in
the
flavor
department
black
macro
blackro
maybe
i
just
coined
a
term
d
damn
good
this
beer
is
a
complete
car
crash
stay
away
nothing
like
you
will
get
if
you
went
to
the
actual
mc
sorleys
pup
in
manhattan
its
a
shame
this
beer
bears
the
same
name
tastes
very
pale
lagerlike
with
some
artifical
sweetner
and
that
stale
warm
cheap
lager
taste
i
have
never
been
able
to
compare
to
anything
else
its
pretty
bad
tasting
its
very
thin
and
it
leaves
a
stale
unclean
aftertaste
unless
you
just
want
to
try
a
new
beer
save
your
money
and
buy
yuengling
black
tan
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
it
was
quite
watery
with
only
hints
at
flavor
the
flavor
wasnt
bad
some
hints
at
perhaps
chocolate
malt
but
quite
weak
it
is
refreshing
and
perhaps
a
good
alternative
to
a
thicker
dark
beer
on
warmer
days
there
are
better
black
and
tans
but
this
isnt
too
bad
for
the
price
nothing
much
exciting
about
it
though
final
note
if
you
see
this
at
the
distributor
next
to
yeungling
bt
grab
the
yeungling
otherwise
this
is
probably
one
of
the
top
five
brews
in
the
case
thanks
to
tgbljb
for
the
trade
meh
not
wonderful
not
horrible
cheap
good
bang
for
your
buck
but
nothing
special
going
on
here
very
little
in
the
way
of
the
nose
taste
is
not
offensive
but
nothing
delicious
mouthfeel
is
soso
fairly
drinkable
goes
down
easy
but
nothing
exciting
here
drinking
this
reminds
me
of
drinking
jack
and
coke
without
too
much
jack
involved
poured
a
clear
reddishcopper
color
with
nice
tannish
head
smell
is
fruity
toasty
maybe
some
dark
grape
taste
present
taste
is
very
nice
with
a
large
amount
of
maltiness
good
and
creamy
finish
is
mainly
malty
with
little
hops
to
be
found
very
thirst
quenching
easy
to
drink
12
ounce
bottle
no
freshness
dating
offered
this
brew
pours
cloudy
dark
brown
with
some
fairly
active
carbonation
as
it
comes
out
of
the
bottle
settles
down
to
a
light
tan
head
with
some
scattered
lacing
this
is
not
a
subtle
brew
just
a
load
of
sludgy
caramel
on
the
palate
prickly
on
the
tongue
also
some
burnt
sugary
malt
also
picked
up
this
is
a
gimicky
brew
playing
off
the
mcsorels
name
i
wouldnt
waste
much
more
time
on
this
one
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
it
is
also
a
bit
watery
only
real
complaint
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
watery
this
one
would
really
benefit
from
a
little
kicking
up
other
than
that
extremely
drinkable
and
not
a
bad
cheap
choice
to
kick
back
with
some
friends
who
need
a
good
crossover
beer
theyll
be
confused
it
looks
dark
but
its
so
mild
pours
translucent
brown
with
a
partially
creamy
partially
effervescent
head
smell
has
toasted
malts
some
alcohol
taste
is
rather
mild
for
a
black
and
tan
the
balance
is
good
though
not
very
strong
good
for
drinking
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
typical
example
of
the
style
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
but
not
the
strongest
tastes
ive
found
a
decent
mellow
offering
in
the
style
ruby
brown
with
a
tan
head
grainy
smell
with
slight
chocolate
and
raisin
notes
graininess
in
the
taste
as
well
with
a
slightly
vinous
character
with
brown
sugar
and
then
a
little
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
very
little
hops
present
slightly
thin
medium
mouthfeel
not
bad
cheap
enoughand
has
enough
taste
that
it
was
worth
buying
and
possibly
worth
buying
again
i
thought
this
blackntan
had
a
impressive
appearance
as
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
the
head
cascades
to
finally
settle
at
a
nice
tan
while
a
web
of
a
lighter
tan
coats
the
glass
it
all
maintained
well
the
aroma
of
sweet
toasted
malt
hits
the
nose
while
hints
of
grain
back
it
up
the
sweet
toasted
malt
comes
along
in
the
taste
as
well
as
mild
hints
of
molasses
dark
chocolate
and
smoke
although
the
tastes
hint
there
way
in
the
beer
is
abit
mild
for
the
style
the
body
i
thought
was
weak
abit
on
the
watery
side
the
drinkability
is
mildly
smooth
i
agree
with
other
reviews
this
makes
a
good
not
to
strong
crossover
beer
another
thought
a
good
cold
dark
offering
on
warmer
days
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
lacey
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
weak
there
obviously
is
alot
of
specialty
grains
here
but
they
are
not
very
aromatic
the
taste
is
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
tastes
a
bit
strong
on
the
malt
side
the
mouthfeel
is
average
the
beer
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
it
is
not
that
smooth
and
is
heavily
carbonated
it
goes
down
like
cough
syrup
this
is
probably
the
worst
black
and
tan
beer
that
i
have
ever
tried
it
is
one
and
done
for
me
dark
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
light
brown
head
that
runs
away
too
quickly
aroma
of
dark
malt
molasses
and
a
hint
of
raisin
flavor
is
of
dark
malt
molasses
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
not
a
very
full
flavor
and
very
little
hop
influence
mild
aftertaste
of
sweet
brown
sugar
and
sweet
malt
mouthfeel
is
round
and
smooth
moderate
carbonation
flavor
could
be
deeper
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
the
price
drinkability
ok
i
could
have
a
few
f
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
black
tan
of
course
they
could
have
done
more
with
this
but
for
what
its
worth
its
a
very
drinkable
dark
american
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
creamy
tan
head
that
holds
ok
the
aroma
is
clearly
fruity
and
even
winelike
but
offers
only
a
slight
chocolatey
maltiness
to
those
who
seek
it
out
the
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
carbonation
that
leaves
it
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
offers
fruitiness
up
front
and
then
reveals
some
caramel
and
mild
chocolate
before
fading
away
in
a
finish
that
expresses
only
a
minor
note
of
lingering
chocolate
the
hop
bitterness
is
quite
restrained
and
just
balances
the
thin
maltiness
overall
a
very
mild
and
basic
crossover
beer
that
might
make
a
nice
change
at
summer
outings
or
with
groups
of
people
who
arent
accustomed
to
stronger
flavored
beers
brown
body
ruby
red
when
held
to
light
tan
head
holds
at
two
finger
for
a
while
then
subsides
to
a
tapletop
coffee
and
cream
and
light
chocolate
dominate
the
aroma
not
big
but
nice
nice
chocolate
notes
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
its
thin
for
a
stout
creamy
for
a
lager
how
do
you
judge
easy
drinking
though
and
good
for
those
intimidated
by
a
guinness
still
its
hard
to
get
excited
about
premixed
black
and
tans
id
much
rather
have
the
layers
floating
so
you
can
experience
the
individual
components
along
with
the
mix
in
the
middle
pours
dark
not
black
with
a
decent
head
that
leaves
little
lace
malty
taste
that
goes
down
real
smooth
real
nice
mouthfeel
kind
of
thick
very
easy
to
drink
the
lager
really
makes
the
stout
go
down
easy
now
i
must
try
more
black
tans
black
and
tans
one
of
my
first
loves
this
is
really
not
a
bad
brew
this
is
one
of
the
beers
i
had
at
my
wedding
very
dark
with
a
respectable
head
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
thick
a
nice
black
and
tan
to
try
for
a
decent
price
prost
a
good
black
and
tan
a
mix
of
a
golden
lager
and
a
stout
some
maltiness
brewed
in
san
antonio
tx
unable
to
find
a
web
site
the
style
is
a
true
mix
im
sure
im
not
the
first
to
point
this
out
but
bottled
black
and
tans
dont
make
any
sense
the
whole
point
is
to
float
a
light
bodied
pale
beer
on
top
of
a
heavy
bodied
dark
beer
its
a
bartenders
trick
whatever
ill
drink
it
anyway
not
a
very
good
looking
beer
opaque
brown
almost
grayish
like
cocolate
milk
thick
creamy
tan
head
good
head
retention
smell
is
bready
dry
yeasty
along
with
a
little
sweet
floral
fruity
herbal
hops
not
bad
drinks
pretty
good
a
little
toasted
sweet
burnt
malts
up
front
that
lightens
up
with
some
fruity
rasin
flavors
in
the
finsh
a
little
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
nothing
too
exciting
its
alright
beer
i
have
had
much
worse
it
seems
like
a
stupid
marketing
gimmick
though
why
not
put
beer
in
a
bottle
of
bourbon
and
sell
readymade
boilermakers
why
they
are
at
it
i
tried
a
bottle
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
poured
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
medium
head
found
it
very
wellbalance
and
flavorful
tasted
rich
nutty
malty
and
was
both
sweet
and
bitter
reminded
me
of
a
scottish
ale
or
porter
would
buy
it
again
overall
a
pretty
great
beer
i
wouldnt
say
it
actually
tastes
like
a
black
and
tan
but
i
wouldnt
hold
it
against
it
tastes
more
like
newcastle
with
an
amber
infusion
good
stuff
clear
brownishamber
in
hue
it
is
a
lovely
color
quite
shinny
too
the
head
was
beige
in
color
quite
foamy
at
the
apex
the
head
reached
two
fingers
in
height
the
retention
was
decent
it
rapidly
faded
to
a
foamy
residue
that
lasted
the
entire
consumption
the
subsequent
lacing
was
basically
none
the
nose
has
its
moments
the
potency
really
isnt
that
loud
it
took
some
hard
sniffs
to
really
get
what
the
bouquet
was
saying
i
could
detect
some
coffee
notes
light
chocolate
hints
caramel
dashes
and
roast
i
assume
the
roast
create
the
astringent
notes
i
smell
there
is
an
odd
metal
undercurrent
but
i
can
get
past
it
the
smells
are
decent
im
not
sold
yet
i
must
admit
bottled
black
tans
are
lame
and
not
a
style
the
taste
of
grays
doesnt
do
much
to
persuade
me
to
say
otherwise
in
a
word
the
palate
is
good
nothing
great
and
far
from
noteworthy
the
maltiness
is
very
modest
and
kind
of
weak
if
not
overly
slick
there
is
nothing
to
sink
my
teeth
into
the
roasty
flavors
are
small
and
so
are
the
coffee
and
chocolate
these
are
really
the
only
flavors
of
significance
this
beer
falls
apart
at
the
finish
in
a
major
way
it
becomes
slippery
with
a
lagerlike
cleanliness
and
some
distant
hops
that
try
to
add
a
grassy
flavor
it
is
not
working
the
fact
the
mouthfeel
is
so
damn
watery
and
the
carbonation
is
so
damn
low
only
hurts
the
palate
light
in
body
i
cant
say
this
beer
is
offensive
i
can
say
it
is
bland
and
thus
pointless
to
drink
enough
said
i
purchased
one
bottle
in
iowa
city
for
1
30
that
is
enough
for
me
if
i
want
one
ill
usually
mix
it
myself
but
as
far
as
prefabricated
bts
go
this
is
right
near
the
top
of
the
heap
smooth
beer
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
drinkabilty
is
above
average
this
brewery
seems
to
really
put
out
some
quality
products
ng
pours
very
dark
but
has
a
hint
of
redness
to
it
when
held
to
a
light
heavy
malt
presence
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
this
beer
starts
heavy
on
the
tongue
but
finishes
with
a
smooth
follow
through
not
bitter
at
all
a
very
nice
after
dinner

balanced

okay
drinking
but
a
bit
too
carbonated

tried
any
of

imo
it

best
beer
dark
caramel
coloured
and
nosed
this
beer
is
in
steep
contrast
to
the
pale
lagers
that
now
make
up
their
collection
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
on
the
second
sniff
the
taste
is
a
nice
malty
main
body
with
a
clean
finish
very
drinakble
and
comparable
to
nelsons
after
dark
or
fat
cats
black
and
tan
worth
buying
a
six
pack
for
the
cold
season
not
a
bad
buy
for
3
50
a
quart
but
not
something
im
itching
to
buy
again
the
bottle
presentation
is
pretty
neat
though
and
it
would
be
nice
to
bring
to
a
picnic
very
smooth
crisp

dark

very
enjoyable
i
feel
it
is
underrated

for

at

for

its
certainly
worth
a
try
quart

from

total

expected
more
from

not

robust

color
is

almost
like

reminds

more
of
a
brown

a
black

definitely
a
saranac

this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
it
reminds
me
of
sweet
tea
in
color
the
smell
is
rich
with
flavor
you
pick
up
on
grains
and
malts
there
is
a
nice
mild
sweetness
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
smell
is
real
inviting
you
also
pick
up
on
some
caramel
malts
now
for
the
taste
it
is
bold
with
flavor
a
mild
sweetness
at
first
you
pick
up
on
malts
and
mild
roasted
grains
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
but
it
is
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
rich
with
flavor
mississippi
mud
black
tan
has
a
real
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
5
out
of
5
mississippi
brewing
co
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
a
drinkable
black
and
tan
caramel
notes
with
clean
finish
i
am
glad
i
gave
the
mud
a
second
chance
its
not
the
most
complex
beer
around
but
it
really
is
a
decent
alternative
to
macro
lagers
it
pours
with
a
bit
fizzy
head
that
retreats
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
and
lingers
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
caramel
malt
in
the
flavour
with
a
bit
of
pilsner
zest
in
the
mouthfeel
i
would
agree
that
it
is
a
far
cry
from
a
pub
black
and
tan
but
for
the
price
and
overall
packaging
its
worth
picking
up
from
time
to
time
o
2
75
this
beer
would
make
a
fine
transition
beer
from
domestic
brews
to
more
craftoriented
beers
this
would
also
make
a
killer
summer
day
session
chugging
beer
right
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
necessarily
good
either
just
okay
for
an
anywhere
near
seasoned
beer
drinker
you
wont
be
impressed
but
the
price
tag
on
it
is
cheap
the
bottle
is
awesome
and
it
would
be
worth
grabbing
if
youre
looking
for
a
decent
beer
to
chug
down
or
keep
a
few
around
to
session
on
great
beer
and
reasonably
priced
a
lot
better
than
expected
it
was
smooth
and
flavorful
not
the
best
reviews
for
this
one
but
i
like
it
interesting
taste
reviewed
because
i
must
do
so
seemed
more
like
a
plain
ol
brown
ale
to
me
nice
malt
flavors
with
a
touch
of
roastiness
and
toastiness
oddly
i
seem
to
like
it
more
now
than
i
did
when
i
tried
it
way
back
in
the
day
enjoyable
if
not
spectacular
i
remember
thinking
this
was
something
special
before
i
knew
anything
about
beer
i
brought
one
of
these
bad
boy
jugs
to
a
st
pattys
day
party
im
glad
those
days
are
behind
me
agreed
with
other
posters
that
you
can
do
better
poured
from
a
tap
at
a
bar
this
beer
is
good
not
great
but
not
bad
the
jug
itself
looks
cool
on
my
bar
first
off
this
is
nowhere
near
like
a
black
tan
you
might
order
at
a
pub
but
overall
its
an
ok
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
very
light
i
kind
of
liked
this
because
it
isnt
heavy
like
some
porters
but
it
is
confusing
as
i
was
expecting
something
heavier
given
the
flavor
you
get
a
hint
of
nuttiness
from
the
porter
but
the
lightness
of
a
pilsner
in
reading
the
other
reviews
here
it
is
evident
those
who
appreciate
exactly
what
it
is
and
for
the
money
i
certainly
can
not
complain
especially
since
the
craft
beer
craze
is
demanding
what
i
believe
is
too
much
money
for
average
to
below
average
tasting
brews
i
dont
know
who
is
pricing
things
this
high
is
it
the
brewer
the
distributor
the
retailer
or
all
the
above
of
course
1
99
isnt
high
for
a
full
pint
of
pretty
decent
black
and
tan
blend
i
would
actually
rate
this
higher
than
the
yuenglings
version
as
yuengling
was
my
first
regular
storebought
bt
until
i
discovered
mississippi
mud
and
how
good
it
tasted
ruby
red
amber
color
flavor
is
mostly
chocolate
otherwise
a
somewhat
unbalanced
mess
id
like
to
try
to
base
beers
seperately
to
see
if
theyre
any
good
one
their
own
price
is
ok
just
dont
expect
much
i
will
try
the
yuengling
in
this
style
also
but
again
these
are
better
freshly
poured
off
tap
saw
this
many
times
but
never
picked
one
up
picked
it
up
this
time
lets
give
it
a
whirl
unscrewing
the
top
i
get
a
nice
smell
of
cocoa
and
sweet
malt
pours
to
a
dark
root
beer
color
with
a
tan
head
that
hangs
on
for
a
while
on
the
taste
the
brew
hits
upfront
with
a
nice
heavy
mouthfeel
continuing
the
taste
the
brew
has
a
a
distinct
dryness
of
the
cocoa
from
the
porter
and
the
pilsner
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
when
it
kicks
in
then
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
clean
with
only
mild
lingering
bitterness
very
refreshing
when
one
is
in
the
mood
for
a
porter
but
not
the
heavy
syrupy
wallop
that
it
packs
also
i
like
the
cool
bottle
as
it
reminds
me
of
a
growler
that
always
contains
good
brew
the
real
beer
32
oz
size
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
if
ur
too
busy
to
mix
ur
own
black
and
tan
than
this
might
be
worth
a
quaff
poured
a
beautiful
color
brown
wonderful
aroma
of
malt
and
beer
amazing
sweet
malty
taste
actually
this
beer
is
not
very
good
hard
to
get
through
the
1st
glass
gotta
love
a
beer
that
comes
out
of
a
jug
o
id
much
rather
make
my
own
black
and
tan
but
this
was
interesting
and
a
sure
bargain
when
you
consider
the
price
per
ounce
o
for
3
bucks
the
price
cant
be
beat
but
dont
expect
anything
to
high
quality
it
looks
smells
tastes
and
feels
like
a
solid
3
5
out
of
5
very
tasteful
beer
for
the
value
picked
up
a
growler
for
4
bucks
and
it
looks
cool
i
love
black
and
tans
and
this
was
perfect
for
saving
the
pouring
out
of
two
different
beers
great
for
when
you
want
a
black
and
tan
at
home
without
putting
forth
the
effort
to
make
it
yourself
overall
this
is
a
start
up
beer
just
a
smooth
easy
drink
that
will
be
pleasing
to
the
new
beer
drinker
the
porter
and
pilsner
mix
just
didnt
work
i
seemed
to
get
the
hops
from
the
porter
first
and
the
finish
from
the
pilsner
and
the
finish
was
a
problem
there
was
very
little
aroma
and
the
carbonation
was
very
light
i
would
not
buy
this
again
the
color
was
the
best
part
of
this
brew
i
find
this
beer
to
be
really
refreshing
it
has
a
great
combination
of
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
from
the
porter
and
cold
refreshing
finish
of
a
pilsner
if
you
looking
for
a
hop
bomb
this
one
isnt
for
you
however
if
your
a
fan
of
a
solid
mix
beer
with
good
malt
flavor
and
a
smooth
finish
give
this
a
try
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
ample
carbonation
smell
is
mostly
hops
taste
is
smooth
no
one
taste
is
over
powering
watery
mouth
feel
easy
to
drink
this
one
nothing
too
exciting
but
there
is
nothing
apalling
about
this
beer
either
very
good
price
at
2
99
for
a
quart
at
trader
joes
overall
this
is
a
tasty
easy
to
drink
beer
the
packaging
is
outstanding
the
quart
size
glass
bottle
has
the
shape
and
appearance
of
a
porcelane
jug
the
screwon
cap
has
a
rubberized
gasket
so
the
beer
can
be
partially
consumed
why
one
would
do
that
is
beyond
me
and
the
remaining
beer
saved
for
later
pours
a
deep
rich
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
good
12
finger
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
and
sides
of
the
glass
a
good
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
has
even
more
going
of
with
a
hint
of
toffee
along
with
the
above
flavors
but
is
more
mellow
than
the
aroma
perfect
carbonation
that
wasnt
over
done
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
is
noted
for
the
finish
i
bought
this
beer
because
it
is
inexpensive
and
had
an
awesome
bottle
it
tastes
great
with
a
nice
malty
and
chocolately
base
the
off
smell
was
a
bit
off
putting
but
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
i
would
buy
this
one
again
great
value
for
the
price
and
awesome
reuseable
bottle
overall
a
novel
if
not
altogether
thrilling
experience
thin
watery
and
bland
with
low
carbonation
i
would
not
drink
this
again
or
even
try
it
again
not
even
if
it
was
offered
for
free
this
beer
doesnt
quite
fit
the
title
i
think
mississippi
dirt
might
be
more
appropriate
conclusion
in
a
world
where
a
gimmicks
are
needed
otherwise
nobody
would
purchase
your
product
this
is
a
great
introduction
to
the
craft
beer
world
the
bottle
is
appealing
the
taste
is
light
not
too
much
of
everything
but
just
enough
for
the
starter
simple
yet
refreshing
although
the
smell
was
lacking
it
more
than
made
up
for
it
with
taste
i
love
a
good
black
and
tan
and
i
thought
for
the
price
i
got
it
4
99
for
a
quart
that
it
was
well
worth
it
good
heavy
notes
in
the
beginning
leading
to
a
nice
crisp
finish
i
paired
it
with
some
pulled
pork
and
homemade
mac
and
cheese
and
i
thought
it
complemented
the
meal
nicely
and
there
was
enough
for
an
after
dinner
drink
as
well
so
it
could
be
muddier
but
as
a
pilsner
fanatic
i
wont
be
moving
it
to
the
b
rack
in
the
fridge
i
recommend
the
mud

very
well
but
there
are
no
interesting
flavors
raisins
and

taste
was
of
a
dark
ale
with
dark
fruits
being
very
prominent
over
the
malt
and
other
flavors
though
the
dark
fruit
was
not
powerfull
mouthfeel
was
not
bad
and
the
carbonation
was
pretty
minimal
i
would
probably
not
purchase
this
for

d
i
could
drink
more
then
a
few
of
these
beer
is
not
that
good
but
the
bottle
will
look
great
in
the
collection
d
ok
brew
that
doesnt
overwhelm
you
with
taste
pretty
easy
to
drink
d
while
i
wont
have
any
issues
drinking
the
entire
bottle
of
this
myself
i
would
probably
rather
share
some
of
this
with
somebody
while
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
its
not
the
most
refreshing
with
that
said
though
i
recommend
this
one
and
will
purchase
this
again
overall
not
a
huge
fan
i
feel
that
the
style
can
be
done
much
better
and
not
taste
like
two
poor
beers
poured
into
a
glass
cool
just
though
d
pretty
good
love
the
bottle
d
wow
i
thought
yuenglings
black
and
tan
was
uninspired
and
forgettable
this
is
one
of
the
most
disappointing
beers
ive
tasted
in
a
long
while
pours
a
brownred
colored
body
fizzy
looking
has
a
smallish
head
slightly
offwhite
in
color
a
nice
malty
aroma
slightly
effervescent
has
a
malty
taste
slightly
fizzy
palate
slightly
watery
fresh
portery
taste
the
metallic
odors
coming
from
the
pint
glass
foreshadowed
what
was
to
come
though
the
bit
of
maltiness
that
also
came
through
gave
me
hope
sadly
the
taste
was
all
oxidized
pennies
and
rusty
railroad
ties
i
searched
for
the
faint
notes
of
malt
and
roastiness
but
they
were
few
and
far
between
only
slightly
less
disappointing
was
this
beers
mouthfeel
which
was
too
carbonated
thin
and
watery
i
couldve
finished
the
entire
32
oz
but
its
sheer
mediocrity
made
it
a
drain
pour
even
after
i
attempted
to
mix
it
with
a
respectable
amber
notes
not
to
bad
sweeter
than
the
average
b
t
and
a
pretty
sweet
looking
bottle
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
the
finish
is
nil
the
beer
is
watery
got
funky
flavors
going
on
in
the
beer
i
dont
even
think
this
is
a
black
and
tan
or
a
poor
excuse
i
think
i
will
pawn
this
off
to
one
of
my
buddies
my
traditional
view
of
black
and
tan
is
bass
english
pale
ale
with
guiness
irish
dry
stout
mississippi
mud
elects
to
to
combine
a
continental
pilsner
with
an
english
porter
the
result
is
an
overcarbonated
pilsner
beating
down
a
wimpy
subpar
porter
tastes
like
sour
cola
this
is
by
no
means
a
horrible
beer
it
is
very
affordable
i
payed
2
99
for
a
32oz
growler
i
would
suggest
this
beer
to
folks
just
starting
out
tasting
craft
beers
the
mild
characteristics
presented
are
good
fundamental
beer
tasting
stepping
stones
dont
really
understand
this
beer
seeing
that
a
black
tan
is
normally
2
beers
yes
i
know
the
traditional
porter
is
2
beers
that
are
blended
but
still
pours
darm
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
cocoa
and
metal
aroma
thin
mouthfeel
not
really
smoky
or
nutty
or
chocolate
kind
of
a
blend
of
all
three
overall
i
think
my
memories
are
fonder
then
what
this
really
was
not
at
all
as
good
as
i
remember
but
ehh
was
worth
it
for
the
memories
pretty
average
beer
the
taste
is
good
but
theres
a
little
bit
too
much
carbonation
and
it
comes
offas
being
fizzy
and
forced
again
i
did
enjoy
the
flavor
but
it
wasnt
very
deep
or
complex
when
compared
to
similar
beers
ill
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
a
bottle
eric
ive
never
had
a
premixed
black
and
tan
but
this
is
nothing
like
the
bar
trick
brews
ive
experienced
in
the
past
interesting
it
was
a
mix
of
porter
and
pilsner
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
despite
the
very
low
price
hey
how
come
its
called
mississippi
mud
when
its
brewed
in
new
york
drinkability
this
is
not
a
good
beer
by
any
means
and
unless
you
enjoy
the
taste
of
a
halfassed
black
tan
id
recommend
staying
away
from
this
one
altogether
spend
your
money
on
something
better
one
more
thing
this
is
a
great
transition
beer
when
trying
to
get
swill
drinkers
to
enjoy
some
better
brews
verdict
watery
and
thin
with
the
lackluster
taste
to
match
the
brewery
has
some
stones
to
call
this
mississippi
mud
its
closer
to
st
louis
runoff
im
assuming
that
the
continental
lager
mentioned
on
the
bottle
is
clever
code
for
a
typical
american
macrolager
and
it
certainly
does
taste
like
a
middleoftheroad

liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
actually
i
would
drink
this
one
regularly
if
it
were
available
in
tennessee
this
would
make
a
good
session
brew
tilley4feb
07
which
makes
sense
for
a
mud
coloring
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
some
grains
like
coffee
and
even
some
hops
this
beer
actually
tastes
pretty
good
i
like
this
beer
it
tastes
of
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
has
hints
of
coffee
in
it
pale
grains
the
smell
is
all
malts
this
beer
tastes
like
someone
took
a
semidecent
porter
and
mixed
it
half
and
half
with
sparkling
water
really
forming
a
thin
14
inch
head
that
quickly
faded
light
spots
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
light
and
i
stopped
in
to
whole
foods
and
this
bottle
sort
of
jumped
out
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
coffee
i
find
this
one
to
hit
a
sour
note
elricoricojan

but
nothing
spectacular
nice
mouthfeel
malty
not
bad
taste
is
pretty
pale
somewhat
of
a
watered
down
porterwhich
i
guess
is
what
a
black
and
tan
essentially
is
but
i
like
it
its
very
subtle
mouthfeel
either
of
which
is
fun
to
look
at
and
carry
around
never
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
that
will
still
draw
ridicule
from

was
given
this
beer
at
an
xmas
party
needless
the
say
with
some
bitterness
and
tinge
of
astringency
in
the
finish
this
brew
is
simple
and
smooth
it
goes
down
real
nice
and
easy
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
quite
drinkable
and

bottled

there
isnt
anything
extraordinary
here
flavors
are

that
said
the
beer
is
about
what
you
would
expect
in
a
prepaged
black
and
tan
this
isnt
terrible
and
found
this
brew
suprisingly
good
a
good
beer
to
try
especially
for
the
price

i
kinda
enjoyed
this
brew
basically
a
weak
with
a
thin
off
white
head
there
is
almost
no
smell
no
more
mississippi
mud
black
tan
for
me
overall
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
a
bottled
black
and
tan
but
it
seems
this
one
is
either
a
bad
example
or
the
only
good
bt
is
made
at
a
bar
i
kinda
wish
it
wasnt
a
quart
sized
bottle
but
i
will
finish
it
i
could
see
some
people
drink
this
but
hey
mississippi
mud
made
in
new
york
such
a
shame
how
many
new
yorkers
have
seen
an
alligator
like
is
shown
on
the
bottle
its
a
scam
cheers
i
can
drink
this
its
harmless
enough
but
no
thanks
most
of
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
lager
with
the
exception
of
the
very
end
which
lingers
like
a
stout
it
pours
a
translucenent
brown
color
with
an
interesting
lace
pattern
the
smell
is
overwhelingly
of
cheap
midgrade
malt
which
is
i
guess
what
youd
expect
a
very
unimpressive
beer
this
brew
is
pours
a
color
that
is
neither
black
nor
tan
and
certainly
not
both
instead
it
pours
a
clear
blood
red
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
would
look
so
bad
for
an
amber
or
pale
ale
but
it
is
not
what
is
espected
for
something
called
a
black
and
tan
the
aroma
is
rather
pleasant
sweet
roasted
malt
nuts
fruit
the
taste
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
it
is
faint
and
mildy
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
brew
to
be
avoided
i
seriosly
cant
see
myself
ever
being
in
a
situation
where
i
wanted
to
drink
a
beer
like
this
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
has
a
decent
look
to
it
deep
reddish
brown
very
little
head
on
this
one
with
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
similar
to
a
stout
very
big
nose
of
burnt
chocolate
taste
is
not
quite
what
youd
expect
from
the
smell
but
you
can
definitely
tell
it
falls
into
the
black
and
tan
category
picking
up
some
of
the
burnt
chocolate
taste
other
than
that
its
relatively
bland
and
bitter
mouthfeel
is
rather
bubbly
considering
there
isnt
really
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
evident
drinkability
is
average
could
make
a
night
out
of
drinking
this
but
i
think
id
probably
get
tired
of
it
and
want
something
else
just
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
black
tan
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
this
one
often
especially
straight
out
of
the
bottle
very
simple
and
refreshing
well
at
least
we
get
a
full
1
pint
on
this
beer
ms
mud
has
limited
flavor
and
is
not
smooth
so
down
on
the
mouthful
although
not
difficult
to
drink
i
guess
if
im
in
the
south
there
are
other
beers
i
would
want
to
try
this
beer
feels
very
creamy
and
super
smooth
in
the
mouth
it
has
soft
semisweet
chocloate
and
espresso
flavors
with
a
medium
body
it
starts
immediately
sharp
but
quickly
becomes
smooth
when
the
brew
settles
in
your
mouth
youll
notice
the
espressotocoffee
flavor
trend
is
the
heaviest
of
all
the
taste
suggestions
you
may
experience
the
finish
is
rough
and
bitter
with
a
longlasting
aftertaste
this
beer
seems
not
very
good
to
me
its
flavor
causes
a
little
to
me
acidity
but
nor
to
speak
of
its
presentation
one
of
the
best
and
but
simple
ways
to
presentdisplay
a
beer
its
package
its
label
the
beer
that
i
take
from
this
mark
is
the
one
of
a
liter
with
a
predominant
flavor
to
porter
but
that
to
they
american
to
lager
it
smells
or
and
it
leaves
good
flavor
of
mouth
pours
a
cloudy
mahogany
with
three
fingers
of
offwhite
creamy
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
toasted
chocolate
malts
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
a
blend
of
sweet
roasted
malts
upfront
folllowed
by
a
crisp
pilsner
flavor
and
dry
hops
the
pale
lager
presence
is
strong
and
disturbes
the
balance
but
the
taste
is
still
pleasing
and
complex
finishes
clean
and
highly
drinkable
the
light
lager
gives
an
even
carbonation
and
medium
body
and
the
dark
ale
provides
a
malty
palate
this
smooth
combonation
leaves
the
mouthfeel
a
little
dry
a
little
residual
nothing
i
wouldnt
seek
out
again
really
very
average
if
not
all
together
boring
and
forgetable
the
bland
finish
prevents
any
type
of
session
with
this
beer
notes
one
of
the
best
in
its
class
very
good
taste
and
highly
drinkable
just
keep
it
cold
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
a
little
bit
on
the
boring
side
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
in
this
beer
i
had
high
hopes
which
it
didnt
live
up
to
it
has
a
decent
aroma
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
just
not
there
i
will
have
to
give
the
company
a
thumbs
up
for
presentation
though
if
that
means
anything
i
bought
a
4
pack
af
these
and
now
wish
i
would
have
opted
for
the
single
it
is
a
beer
that
could
be
drank
but
i
would
take
a
porter
or
a
stout
over
this
next
time
next
time
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
black
tan
yuengling
would
be
a
much
better
choice
its
an
ok
beer
a
weird
jug
gawd
knows
who
makes
this
beer
must
be
f
x
matt
medium
brown
appearance
translucent
tan
head
has
little
staying
power
laces
very
simply
some
downwarddirected
strings
light
aroma
slightly
nutty
with
some
stuffy
almost
estery
notes
body
is
very
thin
and
the
carbonation
medium
high
making
for
a
poor
presentation
flavor
is
dissappointing
too
sweet
with
cheap
cocoa
and
a
husky
graininess
thats
at
least
partly
a
result
of
the
carbonation
by
the
time
the
bottle
is
done
there
is
an
annoying
ciderlike
tanginess
before
this
there
are
similarities
to
leinenkugels
creamy
dark
lager
but
no
improvement
in
body
or
a
countertone
doesnt
show
good
qualities
of
any
beer
that
normally
makes
up
a
black
and
tan
mediocre
stuff
here
the
beer
is
smooth
and
reasonably
easy
to
drink
but
not
sure
youd
want
to
my
first
black
tan
i
bought
this
one
because
it
was
relatively
cheap
and
id
heard
good
things
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thing
lasting
head
tastes
like
what
it
is
a
mixture
of
pilsner
and
porter
i
dont
know
if
i
should
blame
the
beer
or
the
style
but
mississippi
mud
combines
two
opposites
with
unfavorable
results
i
want
my
porters
thick
and
my
pilsners
thin
and
by
combining
them
this
brew
leaves
me
wanting
more
recommended
to
try
it
isnt
going
to
hurt
your
wallet
too
much
but
there
are
better
options
the
bottle
is
the
best
part
of
the
package
and
was
added
to
my
collection
the
beer
as
a
whole
wasnt
too
bad
with
a
nice
deep
amber
coloring
and
a
huge
head
when
first
poured
the
taste
is
decent
but
since
this
is
the
first
black
tan
that
ive
tried
i
dont
know
what
to
expect
from
other
breweries
bts
overall
i
found
it
as
highly
inoffensive
and
since
the
price
is
right
i
wouldnt
pass
it
by
this
beer
pours
a
twofinger
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
onequarter
i
detect
a
very
slight
floral
hop
aroma
it
is
a
very
translucent
medium
brown
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lace
on
an
empty
glass
lightly
slick
mouthfeel
it
is
heavy
on
the
carbonation
making
the
flavors
which
are
more
subtle
than
i
expected
difficult
to
perceive
i
get
a
little
caramel
that
finishes
with
a
wisp
of
smoky
grain
this
is
a
chugger
and
should
be
something
to
savor
if
it
truly
conains
any
porter
as
this
company
claims
is
in
the
recipe
i
think
they
are
wasting
their
porter
it
poured
about
2
fingers
of
dense
white
head
with
the
beer
itself
being
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
it
smelled
slightly
chocolatey
but
mostly
grainy
it
tasted
fairly
sweet
like
roasted
hops
and
malt
with
a
hint
of
barley
also
a
bit
of
a
caramel
taste
in
my
opinion
fairly
smooth
overall
it
seemed
a
bit
watery
and
fairly
carbonated
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
memorable
one
it
doesnt
seem
much
like
a
black
and
tan
to
me
i
must
say
i
do
like
the
bottle
though
dark
brown
auburn
like
color
with
a
long
lived
dense
white
foamy
head
not
much
of
an
odor
to
speak
of
but
gave
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
alcohol
smooth
flavor
of
roasted
hops
and
malt
with
a
bit
of
barley
kind
of
watery
as
well
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
would
not
mistake
it
as
a
black
and
tan
this
is
more
like
a
red
beer
thats
been
over
done
worth
a
try
but
not
what
i
would
recommend
as
a
good
black
and
tan
just
drink
it
quickly
this
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
firm
deep
tan
head
there
were
no
off
smells
nothing
spectacular
but
okay
the
taste
was
sour
almost
a
vinegar
the
mouthfeel
must
have
been
okay
because
it
made
no
impression
on
me
this
looks
likd
a
novelty
beer
that
has
not
worn
well
first
sip
reveals
a
lite
body
with
average
carbonation
the
flavor
has
some
anice
qualities
to
it
mixing
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
the
same
grainy
malt
from
the
nose
overall
a
bit
less
pleasant
than
expected
cant
be
sure
but
could
be
the
anice
as
i
dont
like
black
licorice
well
the
beer
is
not
outstanding
for
sure
and
is
not
even
very
good
but
it
has
flavor
and
i
like
it
more
than
most
bmc
brews
the
bottle
is
cool
unfortunately
the
beer
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
bit
of
a
letdown
really
good
thing
the
bottles
really
cool
though
drinkability
that
funky
tan
taste
ruins
it
for
me
would
have
been
semi
decent
if
they
had
used
a
good
lager
for
the
tan
part
now
its
just
a
below
average
beer
nothing
spectacular
as
far
as
drinkability
oh
plus
since
whens
a
pint
473ml
damn
us
measurements
quite
a
different
vessel
for
this
one
a
moonshine
jug
hmm
poured
out
a
medium
brown
with
a
soapy
thin
head
that
stayed
no
longer
than
the
time
it
took
me
to
pour
it
out
its
jug
lacing
was
nothing
to
speak
of
aroma
was
of
faint
coffeebeans
caramel
and
cereal
grains
taste
was
a
little
thinner
than
what
i
expected
kind
of
a
let
down
lightly
roasted
coffee
caramel
grainy
and
thin
this
was
more
tan
than
black
even
though
it
was
a
let
down
it
was
still
better
than
any
macro
brew
ive
had
so
it
does
have
an
upside
overall
the
best
thing
this
beer
has
going
is
its
intriguing
little
packaging
overall
a
really
nice
beer
and
where
i
shop
a
32
oz
bottle
of
this
actually
costs
less
than
a
40
of
bud
wow
what
a
blandtasting
beer
none
of
the
character
of
a
guinness
bassharp
black
tan
this
is
uniformly
blah
thin
mouthfeel
with
little
taste
of
anything
on
the
tongue
this
is
inoffensive
to
the
point
of
being
invisible
allowing
it
to
warm
a
bit
doesnt
seem
to
help
but
it
does
bring
out
barelythere
notes
of
chocolate
and
almond
thanks
but
no
thanks
the
mouthfeel
was
also
on
the
tan
side
kind
of
thin
the
drinkability
was
good
enough
to
put
away
a
jug
drinkability
an
enjoyable
beer
nothing
to
search
for
at
length
but
easy
to
drink
better
than
i
expected
very
thin
and
somewhat
watery
but
has
a
nice
porterlike
flavor
its
a
little
weak
but
pleasant
the
macro
background
doesnt
detract
and
its
actually
quite
refreshing
much
better
than
yeunglings
version
of
the
style
imo
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
coolest
bottles
also
this
beer
was
not
very
good
it
had
a
decent
appearance
but
the
smell
was
a
bit
rancid
the
taste
was
not
appealing
either
it
had
a
very
different
and
strange
taste
that
i
am
not
used
to
it
tasted
like
the
malt
was
stale
and
it
also
tasted
like
it
may
have
been
skunked
not
a
very
good
beer
it
comes
in
a
cool
bottle
that
is
great
to
hold
change
in
the
first
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
cool
bottle
its
the
reason
i
purchased
it
i
looks
like
an
old
pottery
jug
the
pour
was
a
lighter
copperred
tone
came
out
with
a
good
half
inch
head
that
quickly
dissapated
to
a
thin
lace
that
stuck
to
the
glass
throughout
the
drink
the
smell
was
a
very
light
mix
of
floral
and
malt
the
taste
started
very
watery
dare
i
say
almost
macro
watery
and
continued
that
way
until
a
light
hop
and
malt
kick
at
the
finish
a
very
clean
drinking
beer
that
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
but
thats
the
best
i
can
say
for
it
admit
ityou
bought
it
for
the
bottle
i
know
i
did
the
bottle
was
kind
of
cool
in
a
hickish
way
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
the
appearance
was
medium
brown
in
color
much
lighter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
there
was
a
moderate
head
and
good
lacing
the
body
of
this
beer
seems
to
be
missing
though
tastes
like
a
bad
homebrew
to
me
too
sweet
and
thin
up
front
with
no
bakbone
hops
are
little
noticed
if
at
all
maybe
some
earthy
flavors
arise
but
this
is
not
a
good
beer
im
not
wasting
my
time
with
this
stuff
ever
again
pours
a
color
that
as
nothing
to
do
with
mississippi
mud
i
live
near
the
mississippi
this
stuff
has
the
appearance
of
flat
coke
smells
vaguely
like
a
porter
pretty
weak
a
little
hint
of
chocolate
and
malt
tastes
like
soda
water
tastes
of
chemicals
and
fizzy
carbonation
not
much
of
a
beer
not
worth
buying
notes
very
cool
jug
awsome
marketing
for
this
brew
ill
be
honest
with
you
the
only
reason
i
bought
this
was
because
of
what
it
looked
like
i
was
very
disapointed
for
what
this
brew
was
supposed
to
be
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
creamy
crystal
malt
scent
that
is
really
quite
nice
the
taste
is
good
it
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
has
a
nice
sweet
malt
palate
that
goes
down
easy
and
satisfies
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
for
being
served
up
in
a
glass
jug
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
surprised
me
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
what
i
got
was
a
fine
black
and
tan
it
drinks
well
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
massive
creamcolored
head
that
slowly
shrinks
to
a
lumpy
layer
the
smell
is
faint
but
consists
of
light
malts
with
grassy
notes
and
hints
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
tad
of
chocolate
malt
light
hops
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
is
an
extremely
light
bodied
brew
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
definitely
not
great
and
a
few
notches
below
good
cheers
anyways
this
is
a
cola
colored
brew
with
a
bubbly
white
head
topping
it
off
not
much
smell
malty
this
tastes
like
a
clean
lagered
brew
with
the
traditional
black
and
tan
taste
this
one
failed
to
impress
me
much
but
the
bottle
is
pretty
cool
thats
why
most
people
would
probably
try
this
not
for
a
stellar
tasting
brew
i
have
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
the
mississippi
mud
black
and
tan
unfortunately
for
the
mississippi
brewing
co
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
beer
history
in
this
case
influenced
my
decision
to
buy
this
beer
again
i
have
many
positive
memories
with
this
brew
particularly
long
nights
of
mud
and
mario
party
with
my
friend
daniel
so
i
was
very
excited
to
pick
up
a
four
pack
of
jugs
really
the
jug
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
and
hardly
notice
this
is
because
the
beer
which
calls
itself
a
black
and
tan
is
actually
a
strange
flavored
amber
it
pours
into
the
glass
and
you
wonder
for
a
minute
which
beer
from
my
fridge
did
i
just
poor
was
it
an
ale
was
it
an
amber
but
alas
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
did
in
fact
pour
yourself
a
black
and
tan
beer
and
got
nothing
of
the
sort
the
head
bubbled
up
nicely
but
for
a
short
duration
i
took
a
drink
and
imagined
the
perfect
blend
of
ale
and
stout
and
only
in
my
imagination
would
this
occur
the
taste
is
that
of
a
medium
bodied
red
beer
i
have
no
problem
drinking
these
its
not
an
offensive
beer
by
any
means
in
fact
i
polished
off
the
four
without
much
whincing
my
wife
picked
me
up
the
big
jusg
of
this
brew
cuzz
she
liked
the
juglike
bottle
a
few
weeks
agoe
and
i
never
reviewed
it
because
it
was
quite
forgettable
pour
is
decent
a
reddish
brown
color
with
not
much
head
to
itaroma
is
very
grainy
and
malty
but
not
much
there
i
also
got
a
metallic
taste
but
not
much
just
a
slight
metallic
tinge
in
the
finishsome
slight
caramel
malt
taste
but
pretty
bland
a
beer
in
a
gimmick
bottle
quite
a
conceptthat
how
you
can
sell
really
bad
beer
two
big
words
for
this
one
metalic
aftertaste
i
am
glad
to
see
that
i
was
not
the
only
one
to
get
the
metalic
aftertastesmell
at
first
i
thought
it
was
the
glass
but
now
i
know
differently
it
had
a
very
nice
appearance
to
it
especially
the
super
thick
head
the
head
lasted
a
few
minutes
and
then
died
down
to
a
laceing
if
it
wasnt
for
the
metal
tastesmell
it
would
have
gotten
a
way
better
review
sure
i
like
metal
but
musically
not
taste
other
than
that
it
was
an
above
average
atempt
at
a
black
and
tan
get
rid
of
the
metal
and
watch
the
ratings
soar
overall
impression
cool
bottle
but
i
cant
reuse
it
for
homebrew
twist
top
i
expected
a
thicker
more
intense
flavor
this
is
basically
a
thin
slightly
off
porter
i
would
look
at
the
water
source
or
the
cleaning
of
the
metal
in
the
brewing
system
that
or
a
reevaluation
of
the
hops
i
gave
this
beer
5
points
for
appearance
because
of
the
moonshinestyle
jug
it
pours
a
muddy
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
theres
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
besides
fresh
bread
dough
and
mild
hop
the
lightly
smoky
body
is
fairly
heavy
but
not
as
thick
as
it
appears
its
a
bit
grainy
and
mealy
though
still
quite
fluid
the
mildly
applied
hops
have
a
limelike
flavor
but
gets
lost
as
the
malt
sweetens
and
overwhelms
comments

this
came
in
a
moonshinetype
of
jug
that
youd
find
down
south
in
a
backyard
still
its
quite
a
sight
if
you
collect
bottles
you
have
to
go
out
and
buy
one
of
these
if
i
want
a
beer
to
simply
look
at
maybe
id
get
this
if
i
wanted
a
beer
to
drink
i
would
never
buy
this
again
the
most
interesting
this
about
this
beer
is
the
bottle
the
pour
yielded
a
huge
off
white
head
that
filled
my
500ml
pilsner
glass
to
the
top
promising
the
odor
is
sweet
and
somewhat
pungent
normally
i
am
immediately
turned
off
by
a
big
pungent
smell
but
here
its
mild
so
i
proceed
to
expect
a
world
class
beer
here
would
be
to
set
oneself
up
for
certain
disappointment
obviously
this
is
not
a
world
class
beer
what
this
beer
represents
is
a
relatively
inexpensive
alternative
to
the
common
dark
swill
the
taste
is
subtle
and
smooth
and
the
mouthfeel
is
more
watery
than
i
would
like
but
it
is
definitely
drinkable
it
has
a
fair
balance
between
a
pleasant
sweetness
and
light
roasted
flavor
as
far
as
it
being
the
combination
of
a
robust
english
porter
and
a
continental
pilsner
as
so
dictated
on
the
bottle
i
think
they
are
at
least
somewhat
accurate
it
is
definitely
the
unique
combination
of
a
pilsner
a
light
light
pilsner
urquell
and
a
porter
not
robust
but
it
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
is
however
strangely
enough
it
is
growing
on
me
as
it
warms
up
will
not
return
to
this
one
again
the
beer
is
a
light
brown
color
with
more
clarity
than
i
expected
and
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
pleasingly
of
roasted
malts
theres
a
fruity
sweetness
up
front
and
a
very
light
hopiness
overall
id
describe
this
beer
as
watery
and
uninspiring
another
gimmick
beer
its
got
a
cool
bottle
going
for
it
but
not
much
else
im
not
sure
exactly
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
in
southern
new
jersey
i
think
its
the
packaging
but
after
seeing
it
time
and
time
again
in
liquor
store
coolers
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
it
pours
a
clear
mahogany
body
thats
topped
by
a
short
but
creamy
tan
head
the
head
retention
is
only
fair
and
it
drops
shortly
to
a
thin
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
but
leaves
some
lace
initially
fruitiness
is
prevelent
in
the
nose
backed
up
by
a
touch
of
lightly
caramel
and
cocoatinged
malt
theres
not
alot
going
on
but
its
actually
quite
nice
and
very
welcoming
the
body
is
light
and
its
crisp
on
the
tongue
in
the
flavor
assorted
fruits
apple
grape
orange
berry
and
chocolatecocoatinged
malt
combine
in
a
mildly
sweet
cornicopia
of
drinkability
theres
no
noticeable
hop
flavor
present
and
the
bitterness
plays
only
a
supporting
role
it
finishes
with
a
flourish
of
fruit
followed
by
a
soft
note
of
cocoa
and
then
dries
out
with
a
very
mild
note
of
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
although
its
very
simplistic
it
is
actually
quite
quaffable
it
has
more
character
that
most
mainstream
american
lagers
and
makes
a
good
crossover
beer
for
the
uninitiated
yupper
gotta
like
the
bottle
at
least
a
decent
mahogany
colour
with
a
very
impressive
choppy
foamy
tan
head
nose
is
of
sweet
sweet
malt
some
toffee
and
caramel
not
a
hint
of
hops
to
be
found
flavour
of
sugary
sweet
malt
and
carmelized
sugar
very
watery
for
a
black
and
tan
i
like
the
alligator
for
the
logo
though
drinkabilitynotes
an
interesting
beer
while
i
think
that
the
notion
of
a
black
and
tan
beer
in
a
bottle
is
a
bit
absurd
this
is
nonetheless
a
pleasant
and
drinkable
beer
appearance
was
a
pleasant
reddish
tan
the
smell
was
rather
mild
but
the
tast
e
and
mouthfeel
were
rather
weak
felt
more
like
a
light
beer
drinkability
was
too
easy
a
bit
like
drinking
water
the
bottle
was
very
interesting
that
is
what
intrigued
me
in
my
local
major
market
suggest
you
stick
with
regular
domestics
rather
than
paying
extra
for
this
offering
not
really
a
bad
beer
but
if
i
am
going
to
drink
a
beer
i
will
definitely
not
choose
this
one
probably
the
strangest
looking
bottle
of
beer
that
ive
ever
had
and
why
is
a
beer
called
mississippi
mud
brewed
in
new
york
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
frothy
offwhite
colored
head
that
fades
into
a
good
amount
of
sticky
lace
nose
is
faint
with
notes
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
sweet
malty
flavor
at
first
followed
by
some
sour
notes
i
wasnt
impressed
at
all
with
this
beer
and
i
still
dont
understand
the
concept
of
a
bottled
black
tan
well
there
is
not
much
black
in
this
black
and
tan
the
roastiness
is
really
lacking
with
only
a
subtle
dark
malt
flavor
thrown
in
with
a
lot
of
pale
malts
and
grains
the
body
is
very
light
for
the
style
and
it
is
really
lacking
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
with
light
crisp
carbonation
if
you
are
looking
for
an
unusual
bottle
to
add
to
your
collection
this
one
is
a
must
but
this
wasnt
my
favorite
bottled
black
tan
you
have
to
love
the
novelty
bottle
hell
i
bet
these
things
sell
themselves
just
because
of
the
bottle
well
i
know
that
couldnt
have
called
it
new
york
mud
but
cmon
who
wants
to
drink
mississippi
mud
from
utica
new
york
hold
on
who
really
wants
to
drink
mississippi
mud
well
hey
i
bought
into
it
now
lets
see
what
this
beer
is
made
of
it
pours
a
deep
dark
ruby
tint
and
the
head
is
filled
with
very
large
bubbles
and
it
is
cream
and
color
head
is
sticking
around
for
at
least
awhile
and
the
lace
is
clinging
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
aroma
is
very
faint
i
can
barely
detect
some
grainines
along
with
somekind
of
malt
thrown
in
to
give
off
a
sweet
aroma
no
hops
to
be
sniffed
here
oh
well
lets
see
how
it
tastes
very
smooth
and
on
the
lighter
side
but
it
brings
a
fruit
tone
in
the
finish
that
i
find
very
pleasant
this
is
nothing
exceptional
but
i
find
it
pretty
drinkable
a
bitterness
along
with
a
semi
sour
aftertaste
is
left
but
i
dont
think
its
a
mistake
somebody
tried
to
make
it
taste
like
that
very
light
body
and
thin
in
the
mouth
definitely
doesnt
have
the
texture
of
a
real
porter
mixed
anywhere
in
there
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
find
myself
admiring
the
bottles
but
i
probably
will
never
buy
this
beer
again
there
are
too
many
outstanding
beers
in
the
world
to
settle
for
mediocrity
the
idea
of
a
black
tan
in
a
bottle
is
absurd
to
say
the
least
if
you
are
expecting
the
taste
of
an
english
bt
then
you
will
be
dissapointed
i
found
this
a
drinkable
and
good
beer
not
a
great
beer
mind
you
but
still
very
good
especially
for
an
american
beer
the
maltiness
is
on
the
very
light
side
almost
non
existinet
the
hops
are
mild
also
a
creamy
texture
with
a
good
taste
also
a
very
large
beer
in
a
unigue
bottle
i
have
tried
this
in
both
sizes
and
i
find
the
larger
bottle
has
a
better
flavour
than
the
smaller
bottles
the
first
thing
that
grabbed
me
was
the
catchy
bottle
plus
i
happen
to
like
on
occasion
a
bt
it
has
a
clear
incandesant
dark
red
color
when
poured
a
slight
head
beigecream
in
color
the
lace
matches
the
aroma
has
light
hits
of
caramel
and
malt
the
flavor
malt
in
the
beginning
and
slightly
sweet
not
very
carbonated
drinkable
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
that
type
of
brew
rubygarnet
in
color
very
pretty
but
no
head
and
no
lace
and
hardly
any
carbonation
yikes
odd
buttery
aroma
a
touch
of
floral
hops
tastes
ok
pilsener
and
porter
characteristics
wavering
back
and
forth
no
bitterness
medium
to
light
in
body
and
a
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
nothing
stands
out
and
im
guessing
thats
the
way
its
supposed
to
be
pretty
drinkable
because
its
unoffending
imo
this
is
a
gimmick
beer
it
comes
in
a
pretty
cool
one
quart
jug
that
makes
a
pretty
sweet
decoration
this
concoction
would
be
a
good
crossover
brew
but
i
prefer
my
black
and
tans
properly
poured
on
tap
with
guinness
and
bass
clear
shiny
brown
color
big
fizzy
beige
head
fades
fast
not
much
noticable
on
the
smell
faint
carmel
sweetness
barely
shows
itself
taste
is
nothing
more
than
average
some
sweetness
but
no
body
fairly
thin
and
mine
seemed
very
highly
carbonated
sweet
finish
matched
with
carbonation
made
it
almost
soda
like
more
pilsener
tasting
than
porter
tasting
cool
bottle
looks
like
an
old
moon
shine
jug
with
an
alligator
on
the
front
big
carbonation
burbs
haunt
me
the
beer
pours
a
clear
incandesant
dark
ruby
color
the
head
is
modest
beige
the
lace
wraithish
nose
is
malt
light
hits
of
caramel
front
is
malt
a
tad
sweet
the
top
thin
the
finish
is
shilpit
minimal
carbonation
nebishly
hopped
drinkable
and
the
bottle
is
cute
hinted
at
cheap
sour

one
of
the
few
beers
i
have
poured
out
halfway
through
and
gotten

thick

dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
nice
rounded
mouth
full
of
malt
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
but
this
is
an
interesting
if
ultimately
light
and
inoffensive
offering
this
is
one
strange
duck
and
had
some
things
going
on
that
i
would
never
expect
in
a
black
tan
i
think
i
actually
enjoyed
it
a
lot
more
than
i
would
if
it
had
followed
the
style
more
closely
i
feel
like
i
drank
some
bizarro
belgian
take
on
the
style
from
a
quebec
brewery
which
is
probably
exactly
what
i
did
weird
and
you
know
what
kinda
good
quite
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
solidly
dense
foam
nose
is
interesting
fruit
and
horseblanket
lambiclight
sourness
flavour
is
tart
and
dry
with
earthiness
and
toasted
and
husky
grain
raisins
and
dark
fruit
mild
hops
moderate
body
with
a
sharp
carbonation
finishes
fairly
clean
and
crisp
kind
of
an
oddball
belgian
styled
black
and
tan
bottle
poured
a
light
black
color
ale
with
a
good
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
dry
coffee
is
some
what
bland
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
light
dry
coffee
notes
with
some
lightly
roasted
malt
body
is
just
too
thin
for
the
style
with
some
good
carbonation
no
fundamental
flaws
but
not
a
whole
lots
of
character
as
well
o
a
decent
choice
for
those
who
enjoy
sweet
malt
forward
beers
carbonation
keeps
the
beer
slightly
refreshing
yet
does
derail
the
direction
that
the
taste
implies
its
a
sour
not
bad
but
not
expected
overall
bad
ill
have
to
try
this
again
sometime
since
its
obviously
not
at
its
prime
but
just
a
bad
beer
its
always
nice
to
get
a
growler
of
something
the
appearance
was
nice
and
black
with
a
coffee
colored
head
the
smell
was
a
lot
of
malt
and
very
sweet
the
taste
was
great
with
nice
notes
of
the
malt
and
a
lot
of
chocolate
flavors
in
the
beginning
which
then
led
to
a
very
clean
finish
easy
drinking
but
with
a
lot
of
flavor
my
favorite
part
though
was
the
feel
of
the
beer
not
overly
thick
but
a
nice
consistency
that
coated
my
mouth
i
liked
it
a
lot
and
would
definitely
recommend
would
you
believe
that
i
used
to
drink
these
right
from
the
growler
my
little
joke
was
that
i
could
say
i
only
had
one
beer
about
as
good
as
i
remember
though
i
keep
waffling
on
whether
i
like
this
or
ten
penny
better
maybe
its
just
that
i
had
several
of
these
in
a
row
but
i
felt
like
the
stout
started
to
dominate
after
the
third
pint
kind
of
curious
what
it
would
be
like
on
its
own
overall
this
drinks
almost
like
a
good
euro
dark
lager
or
schwarzbier
for
a
black
and
tan
this
is
fairly
good
and
would
be
one
of
the
first
black
an
tans
i
would
reach
for
for
an
overall
beer
this
is
ok
i
much
prefer
olde
burnsides
scotch
ales
more
cheers
o
drinkable
but
not
the
first
beer
id
reach
to
in
the
taproom
definitely
a
good
session
beer
however
and
i
find
black
and
tans
notoriously
hard
to
pin
down
as
a
style
so
all
things
considered
give
it
a
try
sampled
on
october
6
2011
from
an
overthecounter
growler
available
in
a
local
beer
store
the
pour
is
a
nicely
dark
brown
color
with
bubbles
collecting
at
the
bottom
and
slowly
sneaking
up
top
to
the
tan
silky
head
the
aroma
brings
out
malts
earth
and
a
dark
fruit
like
plum
the
body
was
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
considering
40
of
this
black
and
tan
is
from
a
stout
the
taste
had
this
sickly
sweet
flavor
which
might
have
been
more
from
yeast
that
hadnt
quite
matured
connecticut
recently
allowed
growler
sales
outside
of
pubs
and
i
wonder
if
the
trip
to
new
hampshire
via
a
distributor
might
have
tainted
it
i
bet
it
is
bette
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
o
not
bad
i
always
pass
on
this
in
stores
due
to
the
price
and
sizes
im
pretty
sure
its
only
available
in
growler
or
flip
top
bottle
it
was
nice
on
tap
though
i
was
actually
shocked
to
find
out
it
was
a
black
and
tan
as
the
taste
reminded
me
of
a
milk
stout
d
a
very
nice
brew
lots
of
flavor
and
character
super
sessionable
given
its
5
abv
this
one
blurs
many
a
style
guideline
but
theres
no
denying
its
a
rather
good
brew
i
can
easily
recommend
picking
this
one
up
and
will
gladly
do
so
if
im
every
passing
through
ct
again
a
side
note
this
beer
is
a
60
blend
of
the
ten
penny
ale
and
some
stout
and
the
beer
comes
across
as
a
scotch
ale
to
me
at
least
almost
no
roast
or
anything
dark
about
this
beer
at
all
interesting
but
i
doubt
it
is
a
repeat
for
me
pours
dark
brown
with
a
good
light
tan
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
tulip
thin
cap
throughout
and
a
bit
of
a
collar
the
nose
brings
some
light
diacetyl
and
toffee
mostly
the
latter
though
i
think
the
former
was
present
was
well
roasted
malt
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
better
with
a
nice
combination
of
roast
and
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
good
roast
in
finish
pretty
nice
beer
t
nice
nutty
and
toffee
taste
crisp
and
malty
has
a
nice
smooth
and
balanced
very
very
easy
to
drink
very
good
on
a
spring
day
od
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
packed
in
this
brew
not
something
id
want
over
and
over
again
but
worth
giving
it
a
shot
light
but
a
decent
offering
more
notes
i
understand
that
this
is
a
blend
of
their
ten
penny
scotch
ale
and
a
housespecial
stout
i
would
really
like
to
try
that
stout
acidic
flavor
and
quite
thin
the
darker
bisuity
flavors
are
present
but
muted
light
hop
throughout
the
taste
but
the
finish
sour
and
citrusy
dirty
penny
is
absolutely
a
sessionable
beer
i
like
this
because
it
isnt
light
in
color
it
is
full
flavored
and
local
despite
the
fact
that
i
wish
my
local
beers
offered
better
taste
qualities
and
more
variety
i
will
always
support
them
i
will
be
picking
this
growler
up
again
soon
skål
just
found
my
notes
recently
from
last
summers
northwest
connecticut
brewfest
i
was
told
that
this
black
tan
brew
consisted
of
60
ten
penny
40
stout
poured
a
dark
brown
hue
with
over
a
finger
of
beige
head
good
retention
and
good
lacing
detected
all
of
the
same
essence
in
the
nose
from
ten
penny
e
g
coffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
a
big
chocolatemocha
presence
great
great
aroma
the
taste
began
with
more
of
a
caramelmalty
tone
and
then
eventually
progressed
to
a
mocha
flavor
with
a
dry
coffeechocolate
finish
thick
yet
manageably
smooth
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
very
sessionable
and
again
another
one
of
my
few
repeat
table
visits
during
the
fest
dark
brown
pour
with
a
above
average
tan
head
smells
of
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
toffee
malt
dominates
the
taste
also
hints
of
caramel
and
roasted
coffee
not
much
hop
profile
high
carbonation
and
a
lasting
sweet
after
taste
the
toffee
is
the
major
player
in
this
beer
notes
on
the
last
glass
i
noticed
a
lot
of
dead
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
usually
i
just
drink
it
down
but
it
was
unusual
to
drink
it
in
anything
besides
an
unfiltered
wheat
beer
i
had
a
little
before
pouring
the
rest
down
the
drain
the
next
day
i
woke
up
with
a
bit
of
a
stomach
ache
not
sure
if
the
two
are
related
but
i
advice
always
keeping
the
growler
standing
up
so
the
yeast
stays
on
the
bottom
and
then
trying
to
avoid
pouring
the
yeast
in
the
end
into
your
glass
d
goes
down
so
easy
very
refreshing
i
could
have
multiple
pints
of
this
ive
never
really
had
a
beer
like
this
one
before
the
only
other
beer
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
is
the
ten
penny
ale
cant
wait
to
seek
some
more
out
another
winner
by
olde
burnside
a
nice
roasted
coffee
flavor
and
extremely
drinkable
unlike
any
other
bottled
black
and
tan
i
have
ever
had
but
i
like
it
enough
to
buy
it
again
as
with
the
last
growler
of
theirs
that
i
bought
this
one
is
super
fresh
and
my
buddy
and
i
had
no
time
polishing
it
off
i
really
want
to
eat
this
with
some
steak
and
potatoes
highly
recommended
my
buddy
loved
it
so
it
must
hit
the
spot
for
some
people
just
not
for
me
the
feel
of
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
medium
feel
it
was
pleasing
but
not
too
exciting
it
did
go
down
pretty
smooth
and
would
make
a
good
beer
for
food
pairing
an
ok
beer
way
too
highly
carbonated
luckily
this
faded
with
some
time
fairly
sweet
and
pretty
one
noted
but
definitely
drinkable
growler
care
of
my
frend
dan
who
was
paying
a
visit
from
ct
pours
a
dark
brown
with
more
than
two
fingers
of
tanned
creamy
head
lacing
about
the
glass
from
a
slow
and
steady
recession
of
the
thick
head
of
foam
nose
is
hoppy
with
citrus
and
some
malt
also
includes
some
sweetness
and
burnt
grain
akin
to
chocolate
taste
is
minorly
bitter
upfront
little
bit
of
the
chocolate
character
comes
through
as
well
med
feel
and
low
carb
finish
is
quite
crisp
overall
not
bad
and
one
of
the
more
flavorful
stock
black
and
tans
d
fairly
high
would
have
liked
a
better
fuller
mouthfeel
although
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
off
this
growler
i
cant
say
id
buy
it
again
though
11
i
can
get
many
better
growlers
for
a
few
bucks
cheaper
great
beer
to
drink
by
your
fire
place
with
your
dog
throw
your
sweater
on
throw
on
some
football
and
indulge
in
a
growler
of
tpas
dirty
penny
off
the
tap
at
the
bluebird
tavern
this
beer
was
an
opaque
burnedcaramel
color
with
a
skim
of
mochalike
head
the
retention
was
pretty
good
and
the
lacing
in
sliding
curtains
the
aroma
was
of
mocha
roasted
malt
toffee
and
chocolate
the
flavors
were
equally
complex
and
tawdry
i
tasted
dark
caramel
rich
molasses
coffee
chocolate
hints
of
wood
roasted
malt
and
caramel
yum
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
perfect
sweet
and
satisfying
cheers
d
bought
the
growler
hoping
to
split
it
between
two
nights
but
enjoyed
it
too
much
to
put
down
just
subtle
and
not
overpowering
enough
to
pour
glass
after
glass
but
not
weak
enough
to
mistake
for
poor
quality
i
will
gladly
get
it
another
one
taste
is
smooth
with
roasted
chocolate
flavor
and
very
drinkable
not
so
drinkable
that
i
can
pound
away
the
whole
growler
in
one
sitting
but
very
enjoyable
as
a
refreshing
beverage
in
warmer
weather
bit
disappointed
but
hopefully
ill
get
a
chance
to
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
in
the
future
overall
you
can
put
these
down
wish
it
was
available
in
a
bomber
or
smaller
and
not
in
a
10
00
growler
but
hey
why
am
i
bitching
right
next
to
it
was
a
16
00
rogue
dead
guy
growler
this
was
very
decent
worth
the
try
pours
a
dark
brownblack
from
the
growler
with
a
light
airy
caramel
colored
head
that
is
huge
something
like
3
fingers
it
smells
of
dark
malted
grains
and
some
light
hoppiness
almost
a
homebrew
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
pretty
good
mostly
a
roasted
grain
taste
to
it
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
aftertaste
not
much
hop
flavor
to
it
but
it
seems
to
be
there
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
velvety
and
it
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
definately
worth
a
try
i
think
ten
penny
is
one
of
the
better
conn
breweries
but
still
has
a
pretty
limited
scope
in
terms
of
styles
though
im
used
to
drinking
layered
guinness
and
harp
black
and
tans
i
think
their
blended
version
is
better
than
average
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
sour
almost
lambic
like
i
think
this
might
have
sat
a
while
it
has
a
mild
caramelroasted
scent
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
light
and
easy
drinking
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
has
a
sour
finish
i
guess
the
yeast
has
given
it
some
off
flavors
anyway
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
i
would
have
liked
to
try
this
one
fresh
out
of
the
tanks
as
it
is
i
think
i
drank
a
sat
beer
that
was
past
its
prime
just
as
a
note
his
growler
was
given
to
me
as
a
gift
and
sat
in
my
fridge
for
over
3
weeks
before
i
got
around
to
drinking
it
and
the
carbonation
and
taste
seemed
to
hold
up
very
well
which
has
not
been
true
of
other
beers
ive
bought
in
64oz
jugs
pours
the
color
of
motor
oil
with
a
thick
big
bubbled
tan
head
that
sinks
into
the
beer
to
form
a
thin
dusting
on
top
of
the
body
some
soy
sauce
smells
in
the
nose
along
with
heavily
roasted
coffeeish
malts
and
freshly
innocculated
dough
on
the
palate
heavily
bitter
malts
and
fruity
bittering
hops
hit
first
off
then
doughiness
comes
in
at
the
midpalate
before
the
beer
finishes
long
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
and
just
a
bit
watery
i
could
have
used
more
body
in
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
is
only
ok
in
the
taste
department
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
ale
with
bit
uneven
off
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
behind
has
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
along
with
malt
caramel
and
mollasses
also
smells
of
soething
in
between
bacon
liquid
smoke
hickory
or
bbq
sauce
this
bbq
sauce
flavor
frames
the
flavor
of
the
beer
but
now
also
with
some
chocolate
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
starts
thick
and
luxurious
then
finishes
clean
and
crisp
wth
a
tiny
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
for
something
that
borders
on
smoked
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
a
few
rounds
of
but
i
can
see
how
it
might
grate
on
people
overall
a
slightly
above
average
offering
this
would
be
a
nice
offering
to
complement
a
dessert
course
involving
chocolate
another
solid
offering
from
olde
burnside
md
very
smooth
and
balanced
beer
as
with
other
olde
burnside
brews
my
father
likes
them
as
well
and
he
is
a
prototypical
high
life
man
a
great
session
beer
for
any
hard
worker
or
oaf
like
me
cheers
great
appearance
with
a
head
that
lasts
color
is
real
dark
almost
black
has
a
great
smokey
taste
thick
lacing
circles
the
glass
with
each
sip
dry
finish
with
great
carbonation
small
amount
of
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
malt
taste
other
than
the
mouthfeel
and
appearnce
there
is
not
much
to
the
taste
other
than
a
malty
smoke
very
drinkable
no
real
hop
character
other
than
a
touch
of
bitterness
not
a
bad
black
tan
but
id
prefer
a
guinness
and
bass
this
was
quite
a
drinkable
black
tan
and
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
a
growler
if
i
found
a
place
around
that
carried
this
one
draught
connecticut
brewfest
this
one
pours
an
opaque
brown
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
the
nose
was
fairly
weak
on
this
one
some
roastiness
to
the
nose
but
not
much
else
the
taste
was
a
hint
of
sweet
malts
with
roastiness
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
good
but
a
very
unexciting
beer
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
growler
did
not
realize
it
was
a
bt
kind
of
liked
the
name
it
poured
dark
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
stubborn
head
there
was
also
an
incredible
amount
of
lace
the
glass
was
pretty
much
coated
the
aroma
was
burnt
malts
kind
of
like
putting
my
nose
into
a
wood
fire
the
flavor
is
kind
of
wierd
it
has
the
mellow
malts
of
a
pale
ale
but
the
bold
and
rich
flavors
of
a
porter
dark
chocolate
smokey
malts
toffee
vanilla
and
caramel
mouthfeel
was
very
full
chalky
and
cloying
just
takes
over
the
palate
still
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
wished
i
was
closer
to
the
brewery
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
frothy
12
tan
head
above
the
barely
translucent
dark
caramelhued
brew
head
hangs
on
at
14
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
watery
packy
package
store
is
ct
lingo
for
a
liquor
store
funny
when
we
go
out
of
state
and
ask
directions
for
a
package
store
were
always
directed
to
the
local
post
office
overall
this
was
a
unique
beer
and
certainly
the
rum
barrel
adds
vanilla
and
sweetness
that
sets
it
apart
from
boubon
barrel
aged
beers
the
barrel
overpowers
the
beer
a
bit
and
it
is
perhaps
a
bit
boozy
but
at
12
what
do
you
expect
o
a
very
fine
beer
the
bourbon
flavor
and
aroma
is
there
but
in
no
way
overpowering
youd
never
know
that
this
is
a
12
beer
another
fine
job
by
the
guys
in
hartford
black
tan
really
i
dont
see
that
from
my
meager
experiences
with
guinness
and
bass
this
stuff
is
far
supperior
im
happy
to
report
a
whole
nother
category
a
solid
dark
brown
color
with
a
fair
light
tan
head
with
streaky
modest
lacing
the
aroma
brings
out
big
time
caramel
chocolate
vanilla
toffee
and
sweet
prune
over
nutty
peat
wow
home
run
for
the
nostrils
the
flavor
is
another
heavy
hitter
bringing
out
deep
dark
fruits
with
a
maplevanilla
sweetness
and
a
caramel
touch
i
get
some
root
beer
and
fermented
licorice
this
is
a
chewy
beer
in
flavor
but
the
body
is
more
of
a
medium
light
deal
with
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
touch
that
is
nicely
cut
by
an
active
carbonation
just
a
delightful
dark
brew
full
of
sweet
and
earthy
goodies
that
will
put
a
smile
on
your
face
awesome
brew
the
cobalt
blue
bottle
is
a
cool
presentation
but
the
cost
is
a
little
high
still
worth
it
in
my
opinion
i
just
wouldnt
make
this
my
nightly
beverage
o
i
went
into
this
beer
expecting
something
a
bit
bigger
bodied
like
i
said
before
a
little
sweet
tasting
for
me
and
the
price
tag
is
just
to
much
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
12
99
it
wont
be
in
my
fridge
again
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
cheers

a

some
of
the

towards

vanilla
oakiness
throughout
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
almost
like
its
a

vanilla
and
coffee
milkshake
very
sweet
but
the
booze
balances
it
out
somewhat
the
little
card
that
came
with
this
beer
says
it
is
an
imperial
black
and
tan
and
i
am
on
board
with
that
at
11
99
plus
1
50
deposit
this
is
a
pretty
pricey
beer
however
the
higher
abv
and
the
solid
taste
make
it
more
justifiable
overall
i
wouldnt
buy
it
all
the
time
but
once
or
so
a
year
would
be
perfect
solid
beer
i
dont
regret
my
purchase
but
highland
wild
is
the
star
of
olde
burnsides
recent
2
barrel
aged
releases
o
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
new
offering
from
the
boys
up
in
east
hartford
ct
i
hope
they
keep
making
this
as
i
believe
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
oneoff
anyway
i
highley
recommend
contacting
a
ct
trader
to
get
your
hands
on
one
of
these
bought
a
can
of
this
at
alps
supermarket
in
irumashi
saitama
japan
poured
into
a
suntory
pilsner
glass
suntory
explains
that
this
is
a
blend
of
the
regular
premium
malts
and
the
premium
malts
black
and
that
it
is
only
available
for
a
limited
time
in
the
fall
i
have
had
both
beers
separately
before
but
this
is
one
of
those
rare
beers
where
they
really
do
make
up
something
better
than
their
respective
parts
do
alone
really
wonderful
bitter
yet
refreshing
beer
that
would
go
great
with
any
kind
of
meaty
dinner
o
great
look
love
the
huge
can
many
porter
like
qualities
in
the
scent
and
taste
and
the
amber
qualities
mix
well
with
this
in
the
taste
really
impressed
over
all
and
want
to
keep
sipping
glad
to
have
found
this
one
a
pauls
in
china
well
it
tastes
like
an
average
porter
was
mixed
with
an
average
amber
bock
side
note
this
is
my
first
review
on
ba
the
body
was
ok
kind
of
mediumthin
and
very
carbonated
drinkability
was
terrible
due
to
the
butter
try
this
beer
if
youre
curious
or
a
ticker
like
me
otherwise
avoid
serving
type
big
ass
can
for
whatever
reason
the
bars
of
a
song
often
sung
by
bugs
bunny
and
his
cohorts
runs
through
my
mind
whilst
i
ponder
this
beer
oh
well
this
stuff
pours
a
slightly
dark
garnetsienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
biscuit
and
a
light
bit
of
roasted
malts
during
a
few
sniffs
the
biscuit
comes
across
as
mildly
charred
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
vague
blunt
sweetness
not
unlike
corn
syrup
its
like
an
artificiallysweetened
beer
flavor
the
one
your
nonbeerdrinking
aunt
will
tell
you
all
beer
tastes
like
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
slick
feel
overall
i
think
i
just
dont
get
this
beer
it
tastes
nothing
like
a
traditional
blackandtan
much
less
ones
constituent
parts
i
think
the
overarching
sweetness
and
lack
of
any
real
character
beyond
that
hinders
this
stuff
from
ever
achieving
much
of
anything
pours
a
clear
iced
tea
color
with
a
1
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
small
splotches
of
lace
slide
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
smell
is
of
grains
caramel
and
interestingly
enough
vinegar
ehh
taste
is
pretty
watery
and
is
of
malt
caramel
candies
and
a
slightly
sour
vinegar
taste
as
well
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with
the
weird
vinegar
quality
going
on
not
too
good
overall
this
is
would
be
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
if
i
had
more
of
a
sweet
tooth
but
this
wasnt
quite
my
style
that
said
it
did
not
completely
turn
me
off
of
cold
spring
i
would
be
willing
to
try
another
of
their
beers
in
the
future
thinner
body
slightly
sticky
a
little
dry
i
suppose
this
is
drinkable
but
only
in
the
sense
of
slamming
a
32oz
can
which
can
be
fun
in
its
own
right
bobs
market
la
at
a
good
price
for
a
massive
can
like
23
bones
atthat
price
your
expecting
crap
this
is
pretty
decent
for
the
price
and
i
might
say
a
deal
pours
a
deep
brown
has
some
good
malt
on
the
nose
taste
is
pretty
simple
for
what
it
is
bubbly
maltt
smoothness
i
guess
thats
a
black
and
tan
in
a
can
good
stuff
for
the
price
better
than
expected
not
a
bad
deal
for
the
price
all
things
considered
poured
from
a
doublepint
can
into
what
else
two
pint
glass
for
swmbo
and
me
nice
amberbrown
beer
with
a
creamcolored
head
that
fades
to
a
persistent
ring
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
behind
aroma
of
malts
and
toffee
no
hops
yet
if
i
had
to
put
this
in
a
category
id
lean
more
toward
a
sessionabv
scotch
ale
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
the
hops
are
only
there
in
a
supporting
role
the
body
a
little
on
the
rich
side
for
true
sessionability
over
all
not
a
bad
effort
and
a
decent
beer
in
a
package
that
will
get
into
places
that
ban
glass
bottles
drinkability
surprisingly
drinkable
the
brewer
claims
this
is
a
mix
of
a
bock
and
a
porter
and
i
believe
it
as
premixed
black
tans
go
this
beer
fills
the
bill
pretty
well
for
me
i
do
not
like
the
construct
of
these
cans
short
of
inverting
the
can
beer
drips
down
the
side
during
the
pour
due
to
the
placement
of
the
opening
wotta
waste
onward
my
pour
created
a
finger
of
thick
lighttan
head
that
sat
like
a
cap
above
the
beer
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
ruby
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
color
me
impressed
nose
had
a
vinous
sourness
like
grapey
vinegar
oof
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
lot
of
off
flavors
vying
for
superiority
on
the
tongue
these
included
that
same
grapey
sourness
a
metallic
tang
nothing
to
do
with
the
can
and
a
bitter
chocolate
flavor
double
oof
finish
was
not
quite
as
bad
with
the
chocolate
lingering
along
with
a
better
dried
fruit
taste
as
of
raisins
of
prunes
overall
though
it
was
not
going
to
replace
yuenglings
bt
in
my
cooler
next
i
could
get
past
three
mouthfuls
before
it
went
into
the
sink
even
the
wife
couldnt
stand
more
than
one
little
body
bad
finish
that
tasted
of
metal
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
with
fair
retention
smells
of
malt
with
some
cherries
not
a
very
strong
aroma
the
flavor
is
light
with
watered
down
sour
cherries
and
some
sweet
malt
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
but
i
will
not
be
seeking
this
out
again
d
its
ok
drinkability
certainly
not
a
drainpour
but
not
something
i
wanted
to
savor

carbonation
level
and
noticeable
tartness
tastes
of
yeast
metallic
slight
hops
slight
roasted
malt
and
some
grain
overall
the
grain
and
tart
flavors
are
too
offputting
overall
this
is
no
brown
ale
it
was
kind
of
sour
it
wasnt
horrible
but
it
just
wasnt
to
the
style
if
i
want
a
brown
i
will
get
some
surly
not
bad
not
great
not
bad
i
like
brown
ales
truly
i
do
but
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
poorest
excuses
for
a
brown
ale
thats
on
the
market
it
has
a
rotten
taste
and
it
smells
bad
nuff
said
some
of
the
other
cold
spring
beers
are
ok
but
this
one
is
not
3
in
the
five
pack
sampler
another
brew
that
might
be
a
step
forward
for
cold
spring
but
they
might
have
to
go
back
and
rework
this
one
i
will
be
the
first
to
say
i
am
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
however
this
brew
has
offered
me
a
new
light
ive
said
to
those
who
dont
care
for
stouts
and
porters
that
they
need
to
try
one
thats
very
good
before
theyll
realize
how
much
they
like
them
this
is
apparently
true
also
with
the
brown
ale
thank
you
cold
spring
brewing
company
and
please
tell
the
clements
family
hello
and
chris
hopes
to
see
you
all
this
winter
overall
real
good
stuff
as
expected
from
this
brewery
in
general
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
any
of
their
selections
nice
auburn
tone
clarity
is
pretty
good
thin
creamy
head
of
light
beige
froth
lacing
is
moderate
in
amounts
some
dark
malts
on
the
aroma
with
a
dusting
of
cocoa
and
roast
heres
another
even
keeled
easy
drinker
from
cold
springs
with
decent
but
not
bold
flavor
traits
once
again
very
light
hints
of
chocolate
and
cocoa
a
little
roasted
malt
character
too
brown
malt
comes
to
mind
too
a
little
chalky
nothing
off
about
these
beers
from
cold
spring
anymore
but
nothing
that
really
grabs
my
attention
either
that
said
ill
put
em
back
no
prob
if
offered
to
me
moonlight
ale
is
another
step
forward
for
a
brewery
trying
to
distance
themselves
from
the
disaster
that
was
gluek
its
always
nice
to
see
a
company
who
is
looking
to
improve
their
products
this
one
is
at
least
worth
a
single
or
two
hmmm
this
is
definately
not
an
american
brown
ale
but
more
like
a
euro
dark
lager
or
bock
heres
why
appearance
is
a
clear
rubybrown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
edges
aroma
is
a
faint
caramel
blended
with
barely
a
hint
of
noble
hops
taste
is
a
wonderful
burst
of
bready
malt
full
of
caramel
and
melanodins
found
in
euro
dark
lagers
restrained
noble
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
allows
those
malts
to
step
forward
it
finishes
smooth
and
a
bit
dry
so
that
the
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
i
could
drink
about
4
or
17
more
of
these
like
i
said
this
is
surely
in
the
wrong
category
of
american
brown
ale
and
definately
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
malty
dark
lagers
the
cold
spring
website
states
this
beer
is
a
blend
of
a
porter
using
cascade
hops
as
bittering
and
tettnang
hops
for
aroma
and
a
bock
using
mt
hood
hops
seems
to
be
an
odd
combination
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
good
but
its
very
light
bodied
not
the
best
brown
maybe
it
was
the
glacial
mineral
water
would
not
drink
again
very
balanced
and
a
great
mouth
feel
this
one
of
my
faves
great
black
and
tan
if
what
it
is
your
looking
for
this
beer
is
decent
i
really
would
suggest
making
black
and
tans
by
hand
they
look
and
taste
much
better
ive
come
to
find
out
that
when
your
on
vacation
beer
is
like
pizza
when
its
good
its
real
good
and
when
its
bad
it
still
pretty
good
one
of
the
best
saranac
beers
and
an
absolute
taste
of
fall
for
me
pours
thick
and
dark
like
a
cup
of
coffee
has
a
nice
tall
lasting
brown
head
on
it
notes
of
coffee
and
dark
dry
roasty
malt
are
the
featured
smells
but
chocolate
is
also
present
flavor
is
much
much
lighter
than
the
nose
indicates
still
quite
robust
but
more
laid
back
the
chocolate
notes
come
forward
a
bit
and
the
earthy
malts
are
balanced
by
a
nice
crisp
lager
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
its
so
smooth
infinitely
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
dark
beers
to
session
in
the
autumn
carbonation
is
average
and
the
finish
is
very
dry
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
is
a
part
of
the
seasonal
flow
of
life
for
me
overall
this
was
a
rather
tasty
and
affordable
brew
it
had
a
nice
smooth
flavor
and
mouthfeel
profile
and
made
for
a
good
session
beer
o
it
is
a
decent
brew
that
i
might
have
again
overall
very
good
tasting
easy
to
drink
beer
that
i
think
most
people
should
try
at
least
once
not
my
normal
style
of
beer
but
it
might
win
me
over
o
actually
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
that
is
enjoyable
not
a
style
that
i
get
that
often
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
and
definitely
a
session
beer
that
you
could
drink
all
night
o
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
overall
and
it
definitely
goes
down
smooth
however
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
different
and
better
for
a
black
tan
the
flavors
didnt
quite
mesh
for
me
and
while
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
its
not
a
beer
ill
look
to
have
again
soon
drank
a
ton
of
these
in
the
early
1990s
nice
to
try
this
one
again
and
that
hey
its
not
all
that
bad
that
being
said
the
simple
onedimensional
maltiness
grows
a
bit
tiresome
as
you
drink
still
i
can
remember
pounding
these
in
a
number
of
dive
bars
back
in
the
day
so
ill
give
it
a
few
points
for
nostalgia
overall
a
weird
hybrid
that
i
like
and
dislike
at
the
same
time
its
good
but
odd
worth
trying
at
least
once
oa
weak
beer
the
malt
profile
is
poor
and
although
you
can
tell
there
is
a
lager
mixed
in
pours
a
dark
brown
color
12
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
slight
dry
hop
slight
grain
rye
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
black
tan
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
hint
of
sweet
malt
slight
grain
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
dry
hop
overall
the
irish
stout
and
the
lager
are
both
distinguishable
12oz
bottle
pours
a
black
color
with
some
dark
brown
hues
and
virtually
no
head
some
lacing
aroma
is
earthy
and
malty
with
a
bit
or
sourness
and
coffee
taste
is
malty
with
some
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
flavors
a
bit
sour
towards
the
end
earthy
decent
mouthfeel
this
is
a
hard
style
to
try
to
replicate
but
this
is
a
good
enough
job
good
amount
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
overall
worth
picking
up
overall
just
ok
a
good
midweek
budget
beer
option
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
this
is
unique
in
that
you
can
taste
the
irish
ale
as
well
as
the
german
lager
unique
and
different
ive
always
thought
black
and
tans
in
a
bottle
were
a
little
gimmicky
seeing
how
the
dark
and
light
beer
is
all
mixed
together
pours
black
w
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
average
carbonation
and
lacing
nose
is
that
of
caramel
malt
hops
some
chocolate
maybe
some
coffee
as
well
thats
about
it
really
fairly
thin
on
the
nose
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
with
some
coffee
being
thrown
forefront
into
the
mix
still
its
fairly
thin
and
weak
on
the
taste
front
feel
is
pretty
thin
dry
and
flat
possibly
the
worst
aspect
of
this
brew
overall
you
can
find
better
in
the
style
this
beer
isnt
horrible
but
its
not
great
either
still
ive
been
to
the
brewery
and
im
glad
i
got
to
review
this
one
cheers
a
decent
beer
overall
saranac
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
being
from
new
york
id
say
this
is
on
the
tophalf
of
my
saranac
list
most
saranac
productions
ive
tried
are
ok
drinkable
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
and
serve
to
friends
this
black
and
tan
is
more
like
a
brown
ale
in
apperance
and
taste
nothing
like
mixing
harp
lager
and
guinness
stout
or
bass
ale
for
that
matter
black
in
color
tan
in
head
color
isnt
a
thick
black
like
a
stout
but
similar
to
a
dark
brown
almost
mahogany
faint
nose
with
some
chocolate
and
some
cereal
malts
no
real
hop
presence
chocolatey
bitterness
kicks
off
the
flavor
but
starts
to
smooth
out
to
a
light
caramel
creamy
body
lighter
than
expected
for
its
color
finishes
with
only
a
subtle
bitterness
coming
more
from
the
toasted
grains
pours
a
semiclear
dark
amber
color
with
a
puffy
1
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
thin
tightly
spaced
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
dark
malt
chocolate
syrup
and
caramel
aromas
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
coffee
grounds
caramel
and
slight
roasted
peanuts
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
carbonation
level
making
for
a
crisp
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
and
tan
beer
that
is
much
better
than
the
mississippi
mud
beer
of
the
same
style
i
have
tried
in
the
past
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
presents
with
a
jet
black
coloring
deep
and
dark
with
a
slight
brown
highlight
around
the
edges
the
head
starts
out
solid
and
dense
with
a
height
of
about
an
inch
that
settles
into
a
film
across
the
top
a
beige
topping
on
the
blackness
nose
is
a
creamy
sweet
blend
of
coffee
and
toasted
characteristics
with
a
hint
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
also
the
beer
leaves
a
decent
lacing
of
thick
froth
along
the
glass
while
you
drink
initial
flavors
are
coffee
mostly
with
a
dark
roast
feel
to
it
the
blend
of
taste
shifts
to
a
nutty
and
chocolate
sweetness
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
also
all
the
flavors
stay
light
due
to
the
carbonation
levels
in
the
brew
which
increases
the
ease
of
drinking
the
balance
is
good
enough
to
keep
any
of
the
flavors
from
shifting
into
sharpness
the
beer
has
an
aftertaste
that
is
a
littly
tangy
and
a
little
cloying
with
a
smokey
resonance
to
it
the
finish
clings
to
the
mouth
and
the
creamy
aspect
becomes
a
little
too
coating
decent
brew
despite
the
stumble
at
the
finish
o
not
a
bad
bt
but
its
not
going
to
win
any
prizes
back
to
you
matt
great
brew
poured
out
of
bottle
nice
deep
brown
tastes
like
lager
and
stout
with
nice
caramel
notes
nice
punch
too
hits
the
palate
and
mouth
well
too
saranac
is
becoming
a
regular
staple
for
all
season
in
my
home
summer
to
winter
pumpkin
to
wheat
o
if
memory
serves
me
well
this
is
about
as
enjoyable
as
a
black
and
tan
in
a
bottle
gets
although
one
can
do
better
with
various
combinations
of
beers
found
on
draft
at
a
good
pub
overpriced
in
prague
but
a
bargain
in
eastern
u
s
a
overall
drinkability
interesting
blend
not
sure
i
would
buy
it
again
though
good
looking
but
its
a
lager
with
stout
flavoring
and
im
afraid
that
what
i
want
is
one
or
the
other
not
both
in
the
same
sip
the
beer
is
kinda
black
and
kinda
brown
imagine
that
the
head
is
beige
in
color
standing
in
at
14
and
leaving
a
nice
thick
sheet
of
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
brings
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
pretty
sweet
with
a
large
chocolate
presence
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
finishes
dry
overall
a
decent
beer
d
i
dont
always
drink
bottled
black
and
tan
beers
but
when
i
do
i
prefer
saranac
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
it
has
all
the
stout
and
lager
flavor
youre
looking
for
without
the
heaviness
tons
of
flavor
in
a
very
lightweight
package
just
enough
lager
flavor
to
support
the
stout
which
takes
center
stage
as
it
should
im
a
huge
saranac
fan
and
this
beer
is
just
one
of
the
reasons
why
interesting
succession
of
tart
and
winey
flavors
that
give
it
some
complexity
but
in
the
end
seems
to
be
mostly
about
the
bitterness
both
hops
and
charred
malt
long
bitter
aftertaste
overall
a
surprisingly
good
offering
easy
drinking
and
worthwhile
not
something
i
would
keep
in
my
regular
rotation
but
wouldnt
mind
pulling
this
one
in
every
once
in
a
while
flavorful
good
melding
of
two
other
brews
bottled
or
canned
black
and
tans
are
a
tough
sell
for
me
the
best
kinds
are
the
ones
your
pour
yourself
this
however
was
not
a
bad
stab
at
it
the
rest
body
is
medium
and
slightly
creamy
and
drinkability
is
ok
decent
overall
but
nothing
special
overall
a
good
tasting
brew
that
had
a
very
nice
aftertaste
and
was
quite
drinkable
as
it
was
not
as
heavy
as
a
typical
stout
a
clear
darkish
red
brown
with
a
tan
head
and
good
amounts
of
lace
smell
is
light
coffee
and
toffee
sweetness
hint
of
chocolate
hiding
under
butterscotch
taste
is
all
of
the
above
flavors
with
a
good
roasted
smokiness
and
mild
light
hop
bitterness
toffee
and
bread
lingers
feel
is
crisp
and
light
goes
down
nicely
with
a
quenching
edge
nice
brew
combining
the
refreshment
of
a
pale
ale
with
the
roasted
heartiness
of
a
stout
overall
i
did
not
care
for
this
and
this
was
what
i
do
not
care
for
in
a
stout
of
any
nature
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
from
saranac
i
wont
call
it
the
best
black
and
tan
but
this
is
definitely
amongst
the
better
black
and
tans
definitely
worth
a
try
despite
the
uneven
taste
its
quite
refreshing
not
bad
rather
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
i
would
have
another
one
of
these
its
pretty
easy
drinking
a
fine
tasting
black
and
tan
d
if
youre
a
saranac
fan
their
tones
and
yeast
then
you
could
find
yourself
wanting
a
second
go
at
this
somehwhat
playful
blend
not
a
great
beer
weak
and
watery
disappointing
d
i
honestly
didnt
get
much
joy
out
of
this
one
the
relatively
low
abv
makes
it
go
down
quickly
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
strong
look
and
contributory
aroma
there
was
a
nice
degree
of
complexity
to
the
nose
but
that
unfortunately
fell
short
when
translated
into
taste
leaving
an
average
almost
plain
brew
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
it
has
a
sharp
bitter
taste
that
makes
it
crisper
than
a
guiness
drink
another
slightly
above
average
brew
from
saranac
id
have
this
again
if
offered
or
if
i
see
it
on
a
menu
somewhere
todds
review
states
that
saranac
makes
this
from
a
blend
of
the
irish
stout
and
adirondack
lager
i
havent
tried
the
irish
stout
but
i
dont
taste
a
lot
of
the
adirondack
lager
in
here
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
the
black
forest
and
adirondack
lager
simply
because
the
flavor
profile
is
very
similar
to
the
former
and
the
latter
is
one
of
the
higher
volume
beers
overall
not
too
shabby
but
not
exceptional
either
this
was
my
first
experience
with
saranac
saranac
is
widely
available
which
is
possibly
why
i
have
chosen
other
beers
in
the
past
the
bt
was
similar
to
yuengling
but
i
didnt
taste
as
much
of
that
europeanenglish
style
not
to
say
that
yuengling
bt
is
the
ultimate
example
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
better
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
but
i
stand
corrected
complex
and
full
flavors
throughout
that
cause
continued
contemplation
as
one
enjoys
d
very
drinkable
makes
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
balanced
and
consistent
has
everything
you
would
expect
in
black
and
tan
yet
the
stout
elements
are
not
overly
impressive
but
still
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
solid
brew
nothing
great
but
there
really
isnt
anything
bad
about
this
id
be
willing
to
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
searching
for
it
all
in
all
im
just
not
very
impressed
seems
more
like
an
ipa
and
stout
and
even
then
there
isnt
enough
stout
if
you
cant
get
an
actual
black
tan
this
would
make
a
good
substitute
its
lacking
the
separation
of
the
stout
and
ale
of
course
but
makes
up
for
it
in
a
good
mixture
of
the
two
styles
good
flavor
nice
balance
without
a
huge
abv
which
i
think
is
a
good
thing
i
thought
this
beer
was
mostly
stout
and
only
some
of
the
amber
lager
but
the
lager
is
clearly
dominant
its
a
malty
kind
of
sweet
forward
amber
lager
flavor
pilsner
caramel
malts
with
a
mild
bitterness
at
the
end
with
some
of
the
roast
from
the
stout
as
far
as
a
black
and
tan
is
concerned
its
quite
boring
uninteresting
not
entertaining
and
i
dont
even
truly
feel
that
this
is
a
real
style
although
plenty
of
other
beer
styles
are
blends
im
just
not
getting
this
one
still
like
hoppin
frogs
example
much
much
better
d
im
not
really
big
on
the
black
and
tan
style
i
guess
its
the
irish
in
me
but
this
one
is
ok
it
manages
to
be
slightly
more
interesting
than
either
the
dry
stout
or
the
lager
would
be
on
their
own
this
beer
has
a
black
colour
with
a
reasonable
head
that
lasts
quite
well
it
smells
very
bready
and
malty
on
the
nose
the
flavour
has
a
hoppy
opening
with
some
coffee
overtones
moving
into
a
smooth
and
not
overly
bitter
aftertaste
this
beer
is
light
bodied
and
unimpressive
in
the
mouth
d
decent
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
last
remaining
bottles
from
a
mix
twelve
pack
that
were
in
the
back
of
my
refrigerator
poured
into
an
irish
style
pint
glass
one
solid
color
of
dark
brown
with
a
surprisingly
large
head
smell
had
a
nice
chocolate
malt
aroma
taste
was
a
nice
mix
of
cocoa
and
coffee
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
but
if
this
beers
body
was
stepped
up
one
notch
it
would
greatly
improve
my
thoughts
on
this
particular
brew
i
would
love
to
see
this
beer
made
more
along
the
lines
of
a
porter
wishful
thinking
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
after
two
i
began
to
feel
this
beer
was
a
bit
boring
but
i
enjoy
trying
a
bottled
black
tan
though
as
others
have
said
some
people
may
be
let
down
its
not
really
a
black
tan
once
its
out
of
the
bottle
final
thoughts
this
beer
is
just
strange
it
was
nice
to
try
but
i
would
much
rather
make
my
own
black
and
tan
but
a
bid
nod
for
saranac
for
trying
something
different
never
had
a
black
tan
not
at
a
bar
or
a
prepackaged
one
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
brown
color
with
dark
ruby
highlights
and
a
thick
creamy
mocha
head
the
head
continues
to
deposit
rings
of
lacing
around
the
glass
as
it
travels
down
the
glass
the
nose
has
the
characteristics
of
a
stout
deeply
roasted
malts
like
coffee
and
burnt
chocolate
but
there
is
also
a
fruitiness
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
same
with
the
roasty
flavors
being
subdued
due
to
the
mixture
of
the
lighter
lager
black
patent
malt
coffee
and
burnt
chocolate
are
present
along
with
some
sweeter
notes
like
caramel
and
molasses
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
but
the
creamy
nitrolike
head
makes
it
seem
fuller
than
it
is
very
smooth
overall
very
drinkable
thats
the
point
isnt
it
with
the
lighter
beer
watering
down
the
irish
stout
but
still
strong
enough
to
get
the
enjoyable
flavors
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
a
success
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
goes
down
smooth
and
quick
reminded
me
of
a
nice
porter
with
a
very
approachable
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
drinkablity
is
okay
but
this
isnt
my
go
to
style
pretty
standard
but
saranac
have
made
good
of
it
d
not
too
hard
to
drink
but
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
another
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
brown
and
a
big
beige
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
i
bet
it
could
have
held
a
quarter
up
very
nice
lacing
effect
roasted
nutty
smell
bitter
burnt
taste
of
licorice
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
looked
much
better
than
it
smelled
or
tasted
when
i
poured
it
i
thought
i
was
in
for
a
real
treat
but
in
the
end
it
was
just
ok
a
good
option
if
nothing
else
looks
good
to
you
but
dont
think
youve
scored
a
great
treasure
you
will
be
disappointed
if
you
get
your
hopes
up
d
very
drinkable
yes
sir
may
i
have
another
thirst
quenching
full
bodied
and
pleasant
d
this
really
did
turn
out
to
be
a
rather
nice
surprise
i
wouldnt
even
have
a
problem
drinking
this
again
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
but
not
something
id
reach
for
again
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
d
i
guess
its
drinkable
i
wouldnt
look
to
buy
it
again
its
bland
as
hell
but
hey
i
guess
thats
drinkable
d
when
my
friends
who
thoughtfully
bought
me
this
fancy
beer
ask
how
this
beer
is
i
immediately
respond
great
but
the
reality
is
this
is
not
a
good
beer
i
would
rather
drink
one
of
the
hundreds
o
molson
canadiens
they
have
in
their
fridge
rather
than
this
fancy
beer
d
look
i
could
drink
these
all
day
this
is
a
great
presentation
of
the
concept
of
a
black
and
tan
its
very
hearty
but
good
enough
to
have
several
in
a
sitting
the
taste
is
a
bit
chocolately
slightly
charred
deep
roasted
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
underneath
there
is
a
drying
punch
to
this
beer
in
the
finish
and
almost
a
saltene
quality
that
really
pulls
the
moisture
out
of
the
mouth
there
is
a
charred
quality
to
the
beer
in
the
finish
that
lingers
longer
than
it
should
there
is
a
touch
of
metallic
flavors
and
a
bit
of
an
over
processed
feel
to
this
beer
its
decent
worth
a
try
not
exceptional
but
very
drinkable
overall
impression
not
too
bad
for
a
blendedbottled
black
and
tan
drinkability
this
beers
all
right
and
though
certainly
not
a
hastle
to
drink
nothing
phenomenal
either
its
just
a
little
thin
and
really
not
all
that
special
a
little
to
much
on
the
bitter
notes
for
me
and
definitely
not
my
favorite
black
and
tan
its
okay
but
thats
really
about
it
for
me
anyway
this
is
an
interesting
beer
its
not
the
same
kind
of
black
and
tan
you
would
get
from
a
pub
but
it
does
a
good
job
of
mimicking
those
flavors
overall
overall
the
beer
was
decent
its
a
pretty
cheap
beer
but
ive
drank
a
lot
of
them
in
the
past
overall
not
too
bad
from
these
guys
id
rather
have
a
stout
or
schwarzbier
but
this
one
fit
the
bill
decently
for
the
style
worth
drinking
people
shit
on
saranac
all
the
time
but
in
the
drinkability
dept
they
keep
coming
up
with
good
middle
of
the
road
brews
well
worth
the
price
d
i
thought
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
black
and
tan
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
saranac
nice
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
definitely
have
again
d
not
too
heavy
mostly
attributed
to
the
lager
a
fine
job
by
saranac
the
blend
of
the
two
beers
provides
an
array
of
taste
and
smell
that
works
well
together
notes
overall
this
beer
isnt
for
me
its
interesting
but
not
very
appealing
and
the
caramel
maltiness
and
hoppiness
dont
balance
very
well
kind
of
off
putting
pours
a
dark
amberruby
in
color
with
a
nice
12
khakicolored
head
subtly
sweet
creamy
coffee
notes
in
the
aroma
flavor
sweetness
is
then
taken
over
by
a
nice
roasty
bitterness
the
roasty
coffee
character
lasts
long
into
the
aftertaste
a
nice
brew
very
simple
yet
still
pretty
good
nice
light
carbonation
very
smooth
and
drinkable
dark
scarlet
with
a
whipped
tan
head
toasty
malt
amd
mild
minty
hops
in
the
nose
nice
sweet
stout
flavors
dark
fruit
roasty
malt
and
cocoa
watered
down
with
lager
flavors
cant
people
make
this
concoction
at
home
i
suppose
this
is
probably
on
the
better
end
of
pre
mixed
bt
light
bodied
finishes
dry
an
okay
beer
nothing
special
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
initially
comes
out
pretty
dark
but
glows
sort
of
an
amber
crimson
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
slightly
lighter
than
expected
a
farily
light
tan
head
produces
that
is
very
thick
and
foamy
at
first
and
goes
away
after
a
few
minutes
but
prodoces
some
better
than
average
lacing
the
smell
is
very
well
balanced
it
displays
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
quality
stout
and
pale
ale
it
starts
off
very
malty
particularly
dark
and
roasted
moves
through
and
graduates
to
a
nice
hoppy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
medium
to
full
bodied
and
as
mentioned
earlier
its
very
well
balanced
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
drink
it
year
round
bottle
into
english
pint
sampled
21210
pours
a
very
dark
almost
pitch
black
color
with
a
large
tan
head
parts
of
which
remained
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
immediately
presents
rich
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
with
a
slight
hint
of
a
grassy
hops
note
full
bodied
with
a
mild
carbonation
the
drink
was
very
pleasant
starting
with
the
soft
malt
flavor
of
the
stout
but
finishing
with
a
very
sharp
bite
of
the
hops
of
the
lager
a
nice
smooth
drink
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
brown
with
2
fingers
of
lightly
tanned
and
fluffy
head
decent
retension
and
a
solid
wall
of
lace
remains
where
ever
the
head
touched
the
glassware
aroma
is
a
blend
of
malt
sweetness
which
includes
some
grainy
qualities
throughout
the
body
and
hops
on
the
backend
taste
is
quite
crisp
and
bitter
upfront
with
some
darker
grain
characteristics
coming
through
in
the
flavor
that
blends
through
the
medium
to
light
body
with
slight
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
lingering
aftertaste
has
some
mineral
qualities
overall
not
bad
this
is
my
first
premade
black
tan
and
i
quite
like
it
the
best
of
the
saranac
mixedsixer
one
which
i
would
certainly
drink
again
d
id
say
this
is
a
great
black
and
tan
beer
due
to
excellent
drinkablity
due
to
a
5
4
alcohol
rating
id
drink
this
on
with
some
vigor
if
put
in
front
of
me
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
finger
of
strong
white
head
that
takes
a
minute
or
to
to
dissipate
the
smell
is
faint
but
holds
remnants
of
dark
malts
wheat
and
a
surprising
bit
of
hoppy
pine
the
taste
is
somewhat
bland
with
some
dark
wheat
notes
mixed
with
a
light
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
almost
a
dry
biscuity
finish
but
no
butter
cant
have
a
biscuit
without
butter
duh
the
body
is
heavily
moderate
but
not
quite
as
smooth
as
it
could
be
a
little
chewy
near
the
end
but
not
chunkily
so
overall
an
average
brew
that
nonetheless
remains
pretty
drinkable
d
slightly
better
than
yuenglings
version
its
also
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
so
it
gets
an
extra
drinkability
point
not
a
bad
choice
if
i
want
to
shut
my
mind
off
and
session
something
plus
my
dad
always
keeps
it
in
his
fridge
so
i
know
ill
have
it
again
good
brewing
pours
a
deep
purplish
brown
with
a
lively
slightly
off
color
head
the
aroma
is
strong
roasted
with
a
soysauce
edge
there
is
some
wood
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
similar
though
a
bit
weaker
roasted
malt
wood
a
little
round
and
dark
caramel
in
the
back
though
the
finish
is
not
as
robust
as
i
would
like
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
astringent
it
finishes
chalkdry
but
thats
not
really
a
bad
thing
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
dry
with
a
lingering
bitterness
d
not
a
terrible
beer
a
sessionable
beer
if
it
strikes
your
fancy
not
my
favorite
but
not
a
terrible
beer
d
not
bad
the
malt
flavor
is
quite
nice
with
a
robust
roast
character
that
sits
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
just
light
yeast
and
malt
but
the
flavor
helps
to
make
up
for
it
the
finish
is
quite
dry
which
makes
the
beer
a
bit
easier
to
drink
while
also
enhancing
the
roast
malt
character
this
is
a
better
than
average
black
and
tan
and
one
of
the
better
saranac
beers
that
i
have
tried
d
decent
and
definitely
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
its
arguably
the
best
bottled
black
tan
on
the
market
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
over
a
decade
and
im
glad
it
has
held
up
a
definite
recommendation
only
my
second
premade
black
and
tan
but
this
one
was
not
bad
not
sure
if
i
would
try
it
again
but
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
got
this
in
a
adirondack
trail
mix
sixer
poured
into
pint
glass
color
is
blackruby
with
some
good
head
and
a
lot
of
lacing
however
the
taste
and
aroma
doesnt
impress
me
much
since
its
mostly
just
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
not
impressive
much
better
out
there
better
than
your
average
black
and
tan
but
not
the
best
more
flavor
especially
in
the
malt
column
would
push
this
up
the
ranks
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
the
bitterness
gives
it
a
cleansing
quality
and
the
alcohol
level
if
only
moderate
meaning
you
can
enjoy
several
d
smooth
and
balanced
which
leads
to
very
drinkable
beer
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
a
suprisingly
sessionable
combination
of
caramel
and
coffee
flavors
i
could
have
two
or
three
no
desire
for
a
six
though
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
didnt
expect
a
lot
going
into
it
but
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
little
beer
very
complex
for
a
sessionable
beer
coming
from
a
combination
of
two
pretty
different
styles
creates
a
marriage
of
the
best
parts
of
each
a
beer
that
compliments
itself
wonderfully
d
very
drinkable
probably
great
with
a
chocolate
dessert
of
any
kind
a
gift
and
not
something
i
would
normally
buy
but
i
loved
it
i
love
my
bts
layered
but
this
one
was
surprisingly
very
good
great
head
nice
nose
some
malt
some
hops
a
little
of
everything
what
really
surprised
me
was
the
hop
finish
didnt
see
it
coming
the
only
real
neg
is
maybe
a
23
kinda
brew
not
that
its
bad
just
average
worth
a
buy
imo
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
this
but
if
its
in
the
fridge
again
i
wont
hesitate
to
crack
it
open
drinkability
a
decent
beer
really
just
reminds
me
of
a
lighterthanaverage
stout
im
not
that
familiar
with
black
tans
but
ive
heard
that
these
premixed
varieties
really
dont
do
the
style
justice
all
the
same
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
worth
a
shot
aroma
is
a
mild
stout
roasty
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
coming
through
flavor
continues
the
aroma
with
smooth
roasted
coffee
flavors
milder
than
a
stout
and
easier
to
drink
drinkability
is
only
fair
the
flavor
does
not
allow
for
more
very
mediocre
beer
its
looks
are
the
only
thing
to
keep
it
above
a
3
00
saranac
b
t
is
not
recommended
overall
good
but
not
amazing
nice
for
a
holiday
meal
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
pretty
good
the
use
of
an
amber
lager
as
opposed
to
an
english
pale
is
pretty
cool
imo
taste
is
awesome
very
toasty
and
roasted
but
also
light
and
bitter
too
its
really
quite
a
combination
and
it
works
really
well
especially
for
a
premixed
bt
pours
a
dark
walnut
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
with
excellent
lacing
i
think
the
dry
stout
over
powers
the
amber
lager
here
in
taste
hints
of
chocolate
and
mild
bitterness
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
an
overall
nice
experience
a
well
made
brew
looks
like
a
decent
black
tan
a
little
too
thin
for
my
tastes
smells
decent
but
then
its
all
downhill
from
there
once
you
taste
it
you
can
tell
it
was
made
for
the
so
called
east
coastyuenling
type
palates
thin
watery
resinous
old
wood
type
of
flavor
that
is
strong
on
the
tobacco
and
not
much
else
mouthfeel
you
just
want
to
swallow
it
or
spit
it
out
i
guess
its
drinkable
because
it
tastes
like
colored
water
but
its
not
desireable
the
nose
is
interesting
with
some
nice
chocolate
and
toast
character
with
a
mild
bitterness
thats
almost
pine
in
character
mildly
creamy
this
is
actually
not
bad
burnt
malt
character
is
low
the
palate
is
a
bit
of
a
step
down
opening
with
a
moderate
dark
chocolate
character
with
some
bitterness
thats
grainy
in
character
mildly
metallic
too
this
beer
is
a
little
too
thin
and
a
little
too
bitter
for
what
it
is
hop
character
is
mild
with
a
leafy
and
pinelike
bitterness
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
combination
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
mild
creamy
malt
sweetness
thats
like
caramelsyrup
this
mediumlight
bodied
beer
with
high
carbonation
is
decent
on
the
palate
not
necessarily
something
im
dying
to
revisit
this
still
is
decent
taste
was
not
horrible
but
not
very
good
either
in
fact
the
one
descriptive
word
i
would
use
is
it
taste
with
very
slight
chocolate
with
a
distinct
cardboard
flavor
i
cannot
help
but
think
of
paper
or
cardboard
when
drinking
this
it
is
not
overwelming
to
totally
ruin
the
beer
but
it
is
there
to
make
it
be
one
that
i
would
not
want
to
get
again
its
got
nothin
on
dirty
penny
or
yuenglings
version
i
think
the
age
has
really
helped
this
beer
for
a
pretty
standard
in
my
opinion
black
tan
this
comes
out
pretty
good
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
hints
of
malts
not
much
going
on
taste
is
of
light
chiocolate
malts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
but
not
great
beer
cheers
d
not
surprised
to
find
another
excellent
brew
from
saranac
goes
down
smooth
at
a
great
price
and
very
good
flavor
makes
perfect
drinkability
to
me
highly
recomended
black
and
tan
pours
a
dark
caramel
with
a
lot
of
tan
head
and
some
good
lacing
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
adds
a
little
bit
more
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
chewy
and
a
bit
dry
drinkability
is
good
going
down
easy
for
how
dark
and
dry
it
is
overall
not
a
bad
effort
from
saranac
it
was
about
what
i
expected
i
can
already
tell
saranac
is
not
going
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
but
they
did
make
a
decent
beer
with
this
one
seems
like
a
good
gateway
beer
for
getting
into
the
more
flavorful
world
of
craft
beer
cant
really
judge
against
the
style
since
its
sort
of
a
wild
style
will
go
on
instinct
for
this
one
also
my
first
bt
pours
a
very
good
looking
extremely
dark
red
almost
black
with
a
nice
creamy
two
finger
head
that
retains
fairly
well
and
leaves
thick
lacing
down
my
glass
a
bit
more
head
retention
and
it
would
be
a
5
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
hops
and
malts
however
it
seems
like
the
bitters
coffee
and
hops
dominate
the
smell
a
bit
too
much
still
a
good
smell
though
tastes
of
coffee
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
some
bitter
hops
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
metallicness
in
the
end
of
the
taste
takes
away
from
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
right
between
a
light
beer
and
a
stout
maybe
a
tiny
bit
light
good
carbonation
and
a
good
coating
of
bittercoffee
aftertaste
is
left
on
the
tongue
alcohol
taste
toward
the
end
also
takes
away
a
bit
for
me
here
drinkability
seems
quite
good
here
its
got
a
nice
stout
like
flavor
with
a
smaller
body
for
more
sessioning
the
price
is
reasonable
for
the
quality
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
that
hasnt
tried
a
bt
overall
im
not
an
aficionado
in
the
black
and
tan
ways
but
this
one
isnt
going
to
be
a
go
to
for
me
id
rather
have
my
lagers
and
stouts
separate
but
for
a
premix
its
ok
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
deep
ruby
highlights
and
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
that
sticks
around
forever
smells
of
roasted
malts
cotton
candy
some
dark
fruit
aromatic
malts
a
little
toffee
theres
a
strange
bitterness
in
the
smell
that
seems
out
of
place
taste
is
malty
at
first
starts
off
like
cold
coffee
and
dark
fruit
then
that
harsh
bitterness
that
was
in
the
smell
comes
through
a
finishes
with
a
lingering
chocolate
taste
that
would
have
been
great
the
whole
way
through
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
to
thick
in
the
body
medium
carbonation
this
one
was
only
okay
i
liked
it
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
i
liked
it
less
and
less
the
astringent
bitterness
ruined
this
one
for
me
d
this
is
much
too
drinkable
they
found
the
perfect
balance
of
stout
flavor
and
lager
crispness
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
over
an
inch
of
tan
head
it
is
a
reddish
brown
it
looks
like
a
bock
the
smell
is
awesome
it
smells
like
a
riesen
candy
melted
in
coffee
all
i
get
on
the
taste
is
some
roasted
malt
and
coffee
as
i
down
my
second
offering
i
went
into
this
tasting
not
expecting
much
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
could
definitely
drink
this
again
pours
a
deep
brown
though
see
through
from
bottle
to
guinness
pint
glass
12
inch
tan
head
to
start
but
it
quickly
diminishes
to
a
few
floating
bubbles
the
initial
sips
are
bitter
and
fizzy
there
is
a
carameltoasty
malt
flavor
though
not
robust
there
is
what
seems
to
be
a
slight
hop
finish
but
almost
tastes
too
rusty
to
be
hop
a
caramel
malt
aroma
is
present
throughout
accompanied
by
a
little
oatiness
outside
of
the
sweetness
the
aromas
are
pretty
muted
this
brew
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
fizziness
of
the
carbonation
is
a
little
unpleasant
there
is
a
little
rustiness
to
the
finish
i
think
that
the
medium
body
and
smoothness
of
the
beer
makes
it
okay
the
sturdiness
of
the
brew
is
above
average
and
keeps
this
brew
on
the
up
and
up
for
me
all
in
all
i
dont
care
for
the
black
in
tan
premix
but
if
i
had
to
drink
one
i
could
make
worse
choices
than
this
one
pour
is
quite
dark
with
a
silky
offwhite
head
sort
of
thin
looking
though
very
little
aroma
to
pick
up
a
hint
of
roasty
malt
in
the
bottle
flavor
is
well
balanced
between
lager
crispness
and
stout
malt
fairly
smooth
and
actually
isnt
too
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
again
balanced
nicely
while
slightly
nodding
towards
stout
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
malt
may
be
in
there
as
well
its
pretty
good
for
a
black
and
tan
better
than
i
was
expecting
even
its
not
too
heavy
and
a
few
could
certainly
be
enjoyed
drinkability
smooth
but
heavy
very
creamy
and
thick
i
would
love
to
try
there
original
stout
d
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
bitter
but
not
enough
to
limit
you
to
one
very
flavorful
and
a
bit
suprising
pours
a
very
dark
color
almost
black
in
nature
not
as
dark
as
coffee
but
as
dark
as
cola
it
is
very
faint
for
smell
but
it
is
much
like
many
other
dark
beers
the
taste
is
with
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
a
very
dark
and
rich
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
very
mild
drinkability
good
as
a
sipping
beer
but
could
also
be
paired
with
a
meal
a
pork
product
of
some
kind
black
tan
is
above
average
beer
ive
only
had
one
other
experience
with
the
style
hoppin
frogs
bodacious
black
tan
and
it
was
a
blend
of
two
completely
different
beers
67
ipa
and
33
ris
that
blend
was
better
than
this
one
by
a
large
margin
this
ones
not
all
bad
its
got
a
pretty
solid
flavor
the
nose
could
use
a
little
work
but
its
alright
all
in
all
its
about
what
youd
expect
from
an
irish
dry
stoutamber
lager
blend
not
the
greatest
choices
but
better
than
anticipated
definitely
worth
checking
out
part
of
a
variety
six
pack
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appears
a
dark
brownish
red
color
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
chocolate
mixed
with
some
coffee
the
taste
wasnt
as
good
it
was
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
some
hops
initially
and
then
after
a
while
light
hints
of
choclate
and
coffee
came
through
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
i
couldnt
enjoy
more
than
a
couple
of
these
final
thoughts
a
nicely
done
premixed
black
and
tan
d
this
isnt
bad
at
all
and
was
a
bit
suprising
to
me
i
havent
had
much
luck
with
bottled
black
and
tans
and
this
one
works
pretty
well
sits
nice
and
light
and
doesnt
take
too
much
out
of
you
to
drink
that
wierd
chemical
presence
and
the
feel
bring
it
down
a
bit
but
its
still
good
i
would
drink
another
now
the
saranac
drinking
experience
is
finally
over
flavor
is
unified
and
balanced
the
robust
dark
grain
character
brings
flavor
worth
a
try
a
flawed
beer
o
not
bad
not
great
generally
im
a
fan
of
ales
before
lagers
so
i
thought
this
would
be
interesting
and
it
is
unfortunately
i
dont
think
its
for
me
and
i
think
its
due
to
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
first
looked
at
the
bottle
i
doubt
i
would
ever
buy
this
again
its
just
that
id
rather
have
my
stouts
and
lagers
separate
is
all
all
in
all
if
you
find
a
saranac
variety
pack
with
this
in
it
like
i
did
give
it
a
shot
you
might
find
that
you
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
i
would
be
very
interested
in
trying
this
on
tap
if
i
ever
find
it
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
in
the
bottle
again
cheers
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
appears
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
tan
foam
the
head
sticks
around
till
about
half
way
down
the
glass
smells
and
tastes
of
medium
roasted
grains
milk
chocolate
caramel
and
bread
smooth
mouthfeel
with
ample
carbonation
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
around
goes
down
easy
medium
body
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
drinker
and
its
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
somewhat
soft
texture
dry
finish
goes
down
easy
exceeds
my
expectations
dark
caramel
bottom
that
evolves
into
opaque
black
and
big
offwhite
head
stinging
aroma
of
light
roast
chocolate
dark
fruit
woodchips
and
caramel
flavors
of
bitter
chocolate
light
caramel
roast
and
hops
in
the
finish
that
fade
away
into
a
slick
aftertaste
medium
in
body
and
turns
a
bit
oily
in
mouthfeel
a
good
attempt
at
a
bottled
black
and
tan
but
it
doesnt
quite
cut
it
as
you
can
see
the
review
hit
on
similar
notes
but
i
pulled
out
different
features
therefore
i
added
this
review
on
nice
dark
pour
with
a
fluffy
head
the
smell
wasnt
awful
but
the
taste
sure
is
ive
had
a
few
black
tans
out
of
the
bottle
and
none
have
come
close
the
mixed
before
your
eyes
version
i
would
never
have
purchased
this
but
it
was
in
a
sample
pack
i
think
this
is
a
porter
but
then
what
is
a
black
and
tan
anyway
mouthfeel
is
actually
lightthin
crisply
carbonated
in
a
way
i
like
in
many
beers
but
i
think
i
wanted
it
thick
creamier
saranac
and
yuengling
are
the
only
two
breweries
i
know
that
mass
market
a
bottled
black
tan
and
neither
are
beers
id
seek
out
again
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
its
decent
but
it
has
too
much
bitterness
without
any
other
complex
character
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
jet
black
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
nice
amout
of
roasted
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
roasted
bitterness
chaser
the
brew
is
light
bodied
and
easily
drinkable
if
they
could
get
this
a
bit
more
balanced
it
would
bee
greatly
improved
wow
a
weird
flavor
which
was
unexpected
my
view
of
a
black
and
tan
is
a
guiness
w
harp
or
bass
the
saranac
is
a
stout
with
a
lager
this
maybe
why
you
get
that
initial
weirdness
on
the
first
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
pretty
good
and
the
stout
comes
through
at
the
end
i
dont
know
that
this
is
technically
correctly
called
a
black
and
tan
but
its
a
nice
offering
and
worth
drinking
one
of
the
better
ones
i
picked
in
my
last
outing
d
an
okay
beer
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
no
333716377
sampled
on
feb
14
2009
the
pour
is
a
dark
opaque
brown
and
there
is
a
good
supply
of
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
of
chocolate
cocoa
and
malts
i
was
hoping
for
a
creamier
or
heavier
mouthfeel
than
the
medium
one
i
got
the
taste
tended
to
be
heavy
on
the
chocolate
or
cocoa
with
a
hoppier
finish
d
the
bottle
claims
you
can
drink
bottle
after
bottle
ill
agree
it
makes
a
good
balance
of
the
black
stout
with
the
tan
amber
mellow
smooth
and
wholesome
ill
drink
again
a
nice
drinkable
brew
as
a
black
tan
should
be
great
for
when
your
on
the
fence
d
not
bad
not
my
favorite
but
id
drink
a
few
of
these
ive
always
been
skeptical
about
black
and
tans
in
a
bottle
i
prefer
to
make
my
own
but
ill
try
to
give
this
one
a
fair
hearing
pours
an
extremely
dark
mahogany
with
a
big
frumpy
tan
head
its
a
beauty
to
behold
smells
of
sweet
and
roasted
malts
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
burnt
sugar
the
flavor
tends
more
toward
the
black
end
of
the
black
tan
spectrum
i
personally
prefer
it
when
the
bt
scales
tip
in
this
direction
malt
flavors
that
span
the
spectrum
that
are
almost
balanced
by
a
roasty
bitterness
make
this
a
very
tasty
brew
my
only
beef
is
with
its
body
which
strikes
my
palate
as
water
thin
its
full
of
flavor
but
needs
a
little
heft
a
very
nice
beer
pretty
good
be
good
to
try
if
you
want
to
try
a
heavy
dark
beer
but
arent
ready
to
make
the
leap
yet
has
the
malty
taste
of
a
stout
without
being
so
thick
and
strong
too
fizzy
not
something
id
seek
out
bland
was
hoping
for
a
more
impressive
beer
i
wouldnt
say
to
avoid
this
one
but
nothing
great
here
if
you
are
looking
for
a
better
dark
beer
from
saranac
try
the
black
forest
it
is
creamier
and
not
as
harsh
pitch
black
with
minimal
head
smell
is
malty
with
notes
of
bread
taste
is
slightly
bitter
up
front
with
notes
of
chocolate
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
decent
enough
with
enough
carbonation
and
slightly
chewy
overall
probably

poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
and
got
a
dark
black
body
with
a
tan
top
there
definitely
were
hints
of
some
chocolate
and
caramel
in
the
smell
but
because
of
the
lager
influence
it
was
rather
limited
overall
though
the
beer
offers
a
nice
balance
of
body
with
a
stoutlike
taste
i
would
recommend
this
to
those
people
looking
for
a
stout
but
not
wanting
to
be
overwhelmed
by
taste
or
those
looking
for
a
little
more
than
just
a
lager
d
decent
but
not
great
this
is
o
k
but
nothing
i
would
seek
to
have
again
out
of
mixed
sixer
this
bottle
almost
two
bottles
a
stout
and
lager
of
beer
poured
a
nearlyblack
brown
the
head
was
tan
one
finger
thick
and
the
tiny
bubbles
clung
to
the
rim
of
my
glass
moderate
retention
and
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
was
unusual
earthy
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
caramel
sweetness
with
some
hints
of
the
lager
lurking
in
the
background
the
flavors
were
at
first
dark
roasted
malt
and
toasted
grain
then
a
hoppy
bitterness
appeared
and
some
lager
malts
with
hints
of
wood
the
finish
was
long
and
semismoky
as
the
toasted
malt
really
came
through
quite
complex
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
too
high
for
a
beer
as
dark
as
this
not
as
smooth
as
it
could
be
the
lighter
body
does
offer
it
some
sessionability
and
a
crispness
an
unusual
beer
to
be
certain
caramel
taste
is
lightly
roasted
but
ultimately
easy
drinkin
a
good
combo
of
both
the
black
and
the
tan
its
a
solid
but
drinkable
beverage
all
bitter
but
im
guessing
thats
sort
of
how
the
style

i
gotta
say
these
are
some
nice
brews
i
guess
i
was
expecting
some
total
garbage
out
of
this
mixed
sixer
probably
cause
it
came
from
the
random
market
next
door
but
this
is
an
amazing
beer
espresso
because
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
a
bottled
black
and
tan
a
deep
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
not
much
aroma
i
get
a
fair
amount
of
buttery
hops
and
some
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
laces
very
nicely
its
decent
although
i
must
knock
this
brew
a
tad
for
being
slightly
watery
and
metallic
on
the
backend
considering
it
is
a
cheap
beer
and
how
easy
it
does
go

a

a

that
lasts
a

it
sticks
to

real
nice
when

the
aroma
is
of
rich

a

the

just
adds
to
the
overall
beer
the
roasted

hit

beautifully
and
the
underlying

the

color
is
a
clear
dark
chestnut
with
definite
ruby

aroma
is
more
like
a
stout
devoid
of
esters
and
quite
lagerlike
mirroring
the
aroma
and
i
believe
that
it
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
representing
a
black
tan
i
would
love
to
do
a
sidebyside
comparison
of
a
true
black
tan
made
with
saranac
products
with
this
anyway
and
i
immediately
noticed
that
this
was
simply
a
watered
down
version
of
the
stout
which
was
also
quite
average
drinkable
but
i
could
drink
a
couple
if
not
much
else
is
around
i
have
to
say
the
concept
of
a
bottled
coffee
and
chocolate
a
touch
cloying
a
medium
bodied
black
and
tan
a
combination
of
a
stout
and
a
lager
the
stout
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
character
is
present
beyond
that
some
sweetness
on
the
nose
roasted
malt
and
some
hops
are
noted
off
the
top
with
a
slight
roasted
flavor
almost
the
color
of

when
held
up
to
a

with
a
hint
of

this
was
my
first
venture

world
of
black

but
leaves
a

aroma

roasted
malt
some
toasting
noted
and
hints
of

the
taste
was

changes
to
