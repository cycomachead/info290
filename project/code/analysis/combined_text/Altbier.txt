serving
type
bottle
seems
too
aggressively
hoppy
for
this
beer
has
an
english
bitter
quality
to
it

not
bad

hail
to
the
authentic
german
doppelsticke
this
is
the
second
best
doppelsticke
alt
i
have
ever
had
next
to
only
the
mighty
uerige
doppelsticke
the
brewery
and
beer
that
created
the
style
uerige
doppelsticke
and
this
beer
are
the
reason
i
practice
brewing
alts
if
i
could
ever
brew
one
that
tasted
all
the
lines
of
these
i
would
consider
myself
blessed
excellent
medium
smooth
and
relatively
lively
body
through
on
the
aftertaste
very
interesting
german
outside
of
the
norm
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
suggests
but
the
hop
has
a
real
presence
in
the
swallow
the
malt
provides
some
caramel
and
lighter
brown
ale
notes
simply
put
its
complex
but
drinkable
the
body
is
richer
than
some
alts
but
not
noticeably
so
the
carbonation
is
quite
muted
making
the
beer
quite
full
the
aftertaste
is
a
good
blend
of
black
pepper
hop
and
brown
bread
toast
malt
o
the
hops
at
the
end
were
a
bit
much
but
this
grew
on
me
more
and
more
as
i
drank
it
if
you
run
across
this
one
grab
a
bottle
if
you
like
beers
with
a
robust
flavor
stance
you
wont
be
disappointed
a
nice
maltforward
beer
featuring
a
toasted
slightly
burnt
sugar
flavor
character
a
tad
weak
in
the
mouthfeel
a
little
too
fizzy
but
nothing
major
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
wellrounded
and
relatively
light
so
knocking
back
a
bottle
or
two
would
make
for
a
nice
session
episode
a
very
nice
german
ale
o
pretty
solid
sticke
would
certainly
buy
another
bottle
found
this
375ml
bottle
of
doppelsticke
alt
yesterday
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
with
a
2
finger
beige
head
with
cleared
away
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
beige
foam
slight
lacing
love
the
malt
smell
and
i
picked
some
toasted
caramel
mouthfeel
is
full
and
refreshing
will
search
more
of
this
beautiful
style
overall
almost
a
really
good
beer
i
think
the
slight
burn
from
spices
and
woodiness
makes
this
beer
come
up
short
but
otherwise
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
give
this
a
try
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
sticke
alts
ive
had
o
this
beer
is
hearty
to
say
the
least
i
like
it
i
did
not
expect
the
licorice
notes
at
all
but
its
at
least
good
to
see
a
change
of
pace
on
the
doppelbock
and
altbier
style
for
once
for
the
sake
of
practicality
id
probably
not
revisit
this
anytime
soon
but
it
still
stands
as
a
well
made
and
ambitious
beer
for
what
it
is
a
strong
monstrous
doppelbock
flavorwise
one
of
the
strongest
thats
readily
available
on
the
market
opretty
tasty
overall
and
a
nice
well
done
alt
overall
not
bad
but
not
what
im
used
to
for
altbiers
bit
too
much
on
the
candy
syrupy
caramel
toffee
like
flavors
decent
hops
at
least
bit
too
strong
ale
like
an
interesting
experiment
but
not
so
pleasant
to
drink
overall
its
sweet
and
bitter
from
the
500
ml
bottle
bought
at
bine
and
vine
in
san
diego
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
touch
too
smokey
for
my
likes
when
it
comes
to
this
style
the
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
mostly
smooth
slightly
foamy
mouthfeel
closes
semidry
with
moderate
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
after
a
sip
overall
pretty
good
and
unique
id
have
it
again
this
one
pours
a
medium
bodied
dark
raisin
brown
with
a
very
creamy
two
finger
beige
head
the
nose
features
sweet
and
somewhat
fruity
dark
malt
with
a
certain
creaminess
the
flavors
are
much
different
it
is
malty
and
does
have
some
dried
dark
fruit
to
it
but
it
then
goes
into
a
dry
leathery
earthiness
indicative
of
only
a
few
old
ales
after
a
few
sips
i
cant
help
but
think
this
beer
drinks
like
a
crazy
irish
dry
stoutold
alewee
heavy
hybrid
it
drinks
very
very
smoothly
and
is
full
bodied
enough
it
drinks
somewhat
stout
and
is
pretty
dry
it
isnt
boozy
by
any
means
but
it
does
drink
like
a
beer
of
higher
alcohol
content
hard
to
explain
but
it
drinks
big
overall
this
was
a
spectacular
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
old
ales
wee
heavies
or
alt
beers
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
hazy
toffee
brown
with
some
visible
ruby
red
light
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
theres
a
creamy
thick
white
head
that
retreats
slowly
some
nice
lacing
is
left
down
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
the
beer
smells
of
brown
bread
caramel
and
some
woody
and
earthy
hops
theres
maybe
just
a
hint
of
nuttiness
the
flavor
is
about
what
you
would
expect
from
the
nose
i
get
that
nice
brown
bread
and
caramel
maltiness
with
nutty
flavors
and
those
woody
and
earthy
hops
providing
some
balance
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
for
a
beer
beyond
7
abv
theres
a
nice
mild
lingering
aftertaste
this
is
an
excellent
beer
but
only
just
so
overall
this
is
a
very
good
unique
beer
that
stands
tall
amongst
other
alt
beers
that
ive
had
does
its
job
as
a
hangover
beer
right
now
going
down
at
7
5
would
definitely
purchase
again
o
this
beer
is
an
enjoyable
take
on
an
altbier
given
its
added
amounts
of
malts
and
hops
and
the
subtle
amount
of
smoke
in
the
aroma
and
taste
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
interesting
twist
on
a
traditional
altbier
but
still
very
good
easy
to
drink
though
a
little
too
high
abv
to
be
sessionable

d
ive
been
really
impressed
with
this
brewery
and
this
beer
is
no
different
above
average
throughout
pretty
good
beer
and
certainly
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
prefer
versions
from
uerige
and
high
water
but
its
still
fun
to
find
another
doppelsticke
o
not
your
typical
altbier
but
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
this
beer
poured
out
as
an
amber
color
a
creamy
looking
white
head
on
top
has
a
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
surprising
smoked
aroma
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
also
quite
smokey
the
malts
add
some
depth
to
this
beer
with
the
mixture
of
bitter
hops
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
a
little
on
the
heavier
side
i
thought
the
carbonation
is
pretty
good
too
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
if
you
enjoy
smoked
malts
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
them
but
it
was
still
a
pretty
decent
brew
served
in
a
stem
glass
a
dark
brown
liquid
seemingly
opaque
but
more
translucent
as
it
got
to
the
bottom

well
and
left
nice
stratified
layers
of
doily
lacing

very
toasty
and

and
malts
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
toasted
nuts
roasted
malts
light
raisins
peppery
yeast
generous
herbal
hops
and
a
subtle
cocoa
quality
that
came
out
more
as
the
beer
warmed
bready
and
bitter
finish
medium
body
though
maybe
a
bit
heavier
than
your
typical
altbier
very
nice
overall
highly
recommended
in
short
a
rich
and
complex
bitter
yet
sweet
spicy
altbier
on
pair
with
the
best
of
its
kind
this
rusty
brew
is
intense
and
imposing
with
organoleptics
of
toffee
butter
caramel
and
yeast
layered
around
a
minty
piney
center
some
citric
hints
sneak
through
on
the
tongue
to
unfortunate
effects
as
it
clashes
with
the
darker
flavors
furthermore
the
palate
is
flabby
and
coarse
with
a
premature
finish
extremely
unfocused
with
some
questionable
choices
made
regarding
the
hops
o
i
expected
a
bit
of
a
sweeter
beer
but
this
one
is
herbal
earthy
and
dry
i
think
i
was
expecting
something
more
like
a
sticke
doppelbock
this
thing
is
seriously
herbal
and
bread
crusty
not
bad
but
a
little
too
onenote
at
points
o
good
beer
overall
i
would
by
again
if
the
price
was
right
interesting
as
alts
are
one
of
those
styles
that
i
feel
doesnt
get
enough
exposure
o
my
first
experience
with
the
style
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
would
purchase
another
bottle
but
i
am
not
unhappy
with
this
beer
i
think
i
need
to
enjoy
more
beers
in
the
style
for
a
better

nothing
really
all

in

hoppy
than
i
have
come
to
expect
for
the
altbier
style
especially
having
spent
a
couple
of
weeks
in
dusseldorf
the
flavors
are
a
little
more
bitter
and
more
complex
than
others
in
the
style
o
this
beer
is
rather
bitter
for
the
style
but
is
interesting
nonetheless
and
quite
complex
to
other

overall
really
enjoyed

really
digging
this
beer
flavours
mesh
well
together
and
find
a
nice
balance
mid
range
of
complexity
and
nothing
overdone
o
this
beer
is
bold
and
certainly
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
it
packs
a
strong
bitter
punch
and
catches
you
off
guard
certainly
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
and
the
bitterness
was
quite
memorable
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
not
certain
i
would
run
out
for
another
bottle
in
the
near
future
od
just
sort
of
lacking
in
ways
i
like
it
yet
its
dusty
character
leaves
room
for
improvement
good
but
not
great
overall
this
one
reminded
me
a
lot
of
their
kellerbier
which
i
also
enjoyed
the
sticke
alt
has
a
touch
more
sweetness
however
this
is
a
solid
beer
im
happy
with
my
purchase
a
complex
brew
with
a
real
live
rustic
feel
to
it
that
seems
to
be
a
constant
for
the
signature
series
from
les
trois
mousquetaires
the
beer
is
full
of
nuances
including
a
real
interplay
from
the
hops
and
malt
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
makes
the
beer
feel
like
a
higher
abv
great
beer
of
a
style
not
often
seen
outside
dusseldorf
another
winner
in
a
long
line
of
winner
from
les
trois
mousquetaires
these
guys
have
german
styles
down
pat
d
while
i
do
like
this
beer
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
me
as
its
a
powerfully
flavored
beer
and
the
hops
are
more
than
enough
to
satisfy
my
tastes
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
think
this
would
pair
really
well
with
salty
foods
and
think
id
get
this
one
again
as
long
as
i
have
someone
to
share
it
with
pours
a
ruby
redlight
mahoghany
with
a

lovely

is

grassy

and
some
general
spicing
taste
is
similar
general
woodiness
and
a
grassymossyherbal
feel
with
a
touch
of
light
caramel
taste
like
the
boreal

lolwut
finishes
dry
and
bitter
with
tons
of
dark
bread
and
grain
here
medium
carbonation
and
lasting
bitterness
from
teh
hops
relatively
drinkable
and
well
crafted
certainly
quite
different
from
anything
i
would
typically
pursue
full
mouthfeel
with
just
a
hint
of
tingly
carbonation
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
but
the
flavors
are
all
a
bit
too
prominent
it
never
really
gels
which
is
fine
for
one
or
two
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
of
it
very
nice
in
small
doses
though
d
well
it
is
balanced
not
much
alcohol
so
nothing
to
stop
me
i
do
like
altbiers
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
i
love
the
refined
slightly
subtle
characters
on
it
and
the
nutty
palate
its
quite
pleasant
a
tasty
beer
i
love
the
unusual
bitterness
here
with
the
complex
tasty
dry
maltiness
very
nice
this
isnt
a
style
i
generally
seek
out
but
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
altbiers
ive
had
in
the
past
the
distinct
bitterness
made
for
an
interesting
drink
even
if
it
was
a
bit
too
dry
for
me
in
the
finish
regardless
ill
have
no
problems
finishing
off
the
750
this
brew
pours
an
impressive
cherrymahogany
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
very
frothy
two
finger
head
and
nice
lacing
herethere
and
everywherethe
smell
is
a
mix
of
aromas
of
sticky
date
puddingdark
plumscherries
and
dark
maltsit
has
a
nice
fullish
mouthfeel
just
above
medium
bodied
whcih
is
lively
carbonatedthe
taste
starts
off
with
the
dark
fruit
flavours
with
a
middle
body
of
toffeee
malts
and
it
finishes
very
bitter
indeed
so
bitter
that
i
noticed
it
was
which
isnt
the
norm
for
me
as
i
do
love
my
hoppy
beers
but
in
saying
that
after
the
next
glass
i
quite
enjoy
this
bitternessits
definately
an
interesting
brew
that
showcases
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
touch
of
more
bitterness
than
sweet
which
i
dont
think
i
could
compare
with
any
other
brew
i
have
tried
if
someone
asked
whats
it
like
compared
to
as
it
definately
stands
alone
with
its
differentunique
but
nice
mix
of
flavours
and
i
will
revisit
this
thats
for
sure
d
im
generally
a
fan
of
the
more
bitter
offerings
this
is
good
but
a
little
too
far
in
that
respect
to
be
very
drinkable
while
the
flavours
are
interesting
it
does
not
have
thirst
quenching
properties
nice
light
carbonation
a
big
beer
and
very
nice
to
drink
rich
deeply
flavorful
satisfying
and
outrageously
drinkable
perhaps
that
is
the
secret
of
this
sticke
probably
this
brewers
best
effort
an
alt
to
die
for
hope
its
available
again
ill
buy
cases
next
time
i
was
slightly
taken
aback
by
the
flavours
in
this
beer
the
proclaimed
bitterness
was
certainly
present
but
in
a
dry
unorganized
manner
given
the
very
minor
sweetfruity
offset
quite
distracting
and
not
in
a
particularly
good
way
im
not
all
that
sure
what
to
make
of
this
style
it
just
seems
to
be
coming
and
going
at
the
same
time
on
first
sip
i
really
wasnt
sure
whether
i
liked
this
but
the
beer
grew
immensely
on
me
and
probably
ended
up
my
favourite
of
the
evening
its
certainly
a
very
fine
rendition
of
an
alt
and
continues
in
the
trend
of
this
brewerys
excellent
pedigree
superbly
drinkable
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
lots
of
flavor
would
go
well
with
lots
of
food
nice
drinker
thanks
colin
its
a
good
idea
but
the
hops
really
are
overdone
i
think
this
brewer
is
like
that
box
o
chocolates
always
as
surprise
good
and
average
this
one
falls
under
goodvery
good
depending
on
if
you
like
beer
that
finishes
bitter
a
german
version
of
an
english
esb
produced
in
quebec
thats
how
i
connect
the
dots
with
this
one
and
its
one
tasty
picture
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
such
high
amounts
of
continental
hops
personal
palatewise
but
its
still
an
impressive
and
enjoyable
ale
all
the
same
and
ltm
sticks
to
their
guns
by
producing
fine
versions
of
traditional
german
styles
cheers
i
will
admit
i
hate
reviewing
styles
i
know
little
about
this
is
a
great
beer
and
it
may
be
even
better
then
im
giving
it
credit
for
when
reviewing
for
style
that
being
said
you
should
try
this
one
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
you
have
to
like
bitter
beer
to
like
this
one
and
im
not
talking
iipa
bitterness
here
not
for
everybody
certainly
tuned
me
in
to
sticke
alts
obviously
a
quality
product
i
want
more
drinkability
is
good
if
you
like
hop
its
fine
and
bitter
interesting
but
lacking
balance
as
the
hops
overpower
everything
for
me
this
is
too
bitter
to
drink
much
of
i
find
all
of
les
trois
mousquetaires
brews
to
have
this
quality
while
they
definitely
know
what
theyre
doing
theyre
all
too
intensely
something
to
drink
much
of
i
always
struggle
to
finish
off
a
bomber
to
myself
not
because
its
bad
but
because
its
too
intense
drinkable
enough
to
really
enjoy
a
pint
but
thats
it
the
label
states
that
this
beer
is
dominated
by
a
gripping
bitterness
i
agree
none
of
the
serie
signature
are
sessionable
in
my
experience
so
far
overall
meh
serving
type
bottle
quite
good
but
not
as
spectacular
as
other
beers
from
this
brewery
disco
soleil
rose
dhisbiscus
moralité
still
this
is
a
decent
altbier
malty
nose
heavy
body
hoppy
taste
light
bitterness
quite
a
tasty
alt
and
quite
drinkable
pronounced
yeasty
character
that
coats
the
palate
toward
the
finish
perhaps
the
start
could
be
lightened
a
bit
as
the
caramel
gets
a
bit
heavy
otherwise
a
flavourful
session
ale
but
far
short
of
my
favourite
from
this
brewery
still
quite
tasty
and
impressive
would
have
it
if
offered
to
me
if
you
have
the
chance
to
choose
among
their
beers
there
are
better
ones
though
imo
3
5
o
a
good
beer
overall
and
id
love
to
pair
some
mexican
food
with
it
overall
a
very
good
example
of
a
well
balanced
altbier
well
worth
a
try
a
very
drinkable
altbier
lots
of
complexity
and
very
nice
roasted
malt
taste
overall
not
quite
my
style
but
flavourful
and
enjoyable
a
bit
hard
to
find
altbiers
around
here
this
example
from
quebec
pours
a
coppery
gold
with
ample
off
white
foam
aroma
is
tangy
fruity
sweet
some
peppery
coriander
and
nutmeg
like
notes
although
there
is
no
such
spice
in
the
beer
palate
starts
with
pretty
big
burnt
caramel
malts
with
toast
and
dark
bread
crust
fairly
impressive
bitter
spicy
hops
relative
to
others
of
this
style
initially
i
had
a
bit
of
trouble
getting
past
the
malts
up
front
to
catch
other
flavor
elements
but
as
things
progressed
i
started
to
get
some
vinous
fruit
sour
gummy
candy
a
bit
of
yeasty
dankness
spicy
root
cellar
and
more
bitterness
at
the
end
perhaps
some
metal
like
sucking
on
a
coin
its
sweet
as
well
but
this
is
less
obvious
at
first
an
interesting
array
of
tastes
that
unfolds
as
you
go
have
two
or
three
and
youll
probably
notice
different
things
each
time
with
the
malts
in
control
for
one
bottle
and
more
fruit
and
hops
in
the
next
not
too
shabby
and
intriguing
if
you
want
to
pay
close
attention
for
a
session
o
good

overall
an

that
just
doesnt

for

this
would
work
a

great
brewery

i
was
expecting

this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
as
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
it
despite
it
being
brewed
by
ddc
certainly
very
sessionable

beer
isnt
too
crazy
not
boring
just
good
i
am
a
fan
of
this
it
drinks
very
easily
and
is
very
smooth
but
still
brings
a
nice
variety
of
flavor
to
the
table
i
gotta
learn
how
to
brew
something
like
this
because
it
might
be
a
long
time
until
i
get
more
of
this
pretty
solid

a

overall
flaws

do
a

overall
decent

i
like
it

its
sort

interpretation
of
the

o
good

overall
clearly
to

nice
to
see
a
north
american
alt
of
this
quality
not
fully
on
par
with
a
typical
alt
but
a
very
fine
beer
of
its
own
accord
and
well
crafted
worth
checking
out
at
least
once
overall
lots
of
different
tastes
going
on
with
this
beer
it
is
quite
complex
yet
very
easy
to
drink
i
am
rarely
disappointed
with
dieu
du

and
id
drink
this
beer
again
for
sure
o
im
really
digging
the
altbier
style
as
they
seem
to
possess
very
bold
flavours
yet
they
are
easily
drinkable
highly
recommended
ale
and
definitely
worth
grabbing
a
bottle
if
you
can
i
wouldnt
characterize
this
as

a

it

boring
after
just
a
few
ill
pass
in

this

is
a
good
brown
and
a
good
red
mix
otter

is
a
good
maker

and
this
selection
is
a
solid
offering
this
is
simply
a

beer

is
just
on
the
edge
of
exceptional
for
its
style
from
a
brewery
that
has
been
making
solid
beers
for
a
long

this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
because
its
relatively
lightbodied
and
theres
only
a
little
bit

taste
is
very

nonexistent
the
body
falls
into
the
medium
range
and
is
fairly
durable
the
taste
is
emboldened
with
sweet
toffee
malts
with
a
relatively
clean
hop
finish
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
very
similar
to
an
american
brown
so
i
should
really
like
it
however
i
will
say
i
think
i
would
only
have
this
again
preferably
on
tap
mouthfeel
is
fine
medium
light
body
with
light
carbonation
it
just
needs
more
something
highly
quaffable
got
this
in
a
12sampler
the
spring
bock
is
the
best
wont
get
this
one
again
o
just
as
their
other
beers
this
one
didnt
wow
me
nor
did
it
disappoint
me
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
with
low
hop
bitterness
and
not
overthetop
sweetness
o
this
was
nice
drinkable
but
ultimately
forgettable
this
brew
is
very
malty
sweet
and
a
little
spicy
if
you
like
heavy
malts
with
some
spice
you
will
probably
like
this
brew
however
i
would
have
liked
to
taste
something
besides
spice
and
some
toffee
mixed
in
with
the
malts
i
have
had
better
beers
from
otter
creek
o
it
was
the
best
available
beer
so
it
worked
for
the
situation
the
food
was
awesome
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
good
for
the
everyday
brew
this
beer
pours
a
copper
redamber
color
the
head
was
big
and
fluffy
white
and
lingered
for
quite
a
while
the
beer
had
great
lacing
throughout
the
drinking
process
the
aroma
was
malty
metallic
and
caramelish
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
mellow
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
and
slightlyiron
like
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
dry
crisp
and
very
light
i
am
no
very
familiar
with
altbiers
so
maybe
this
is
everything
one
should
be
i
just
dont
know
i
do
think
that
this
was
a
well
crafted
ale
though
nothing
spectacular
but
very
balanced
and
smooth
mouthfeel
burps
taste
nice
and
sweet
d
definitely
not
a
sticke
rather
dry
and
toasty
backed
firmly
by
largely
woody
hops
quite
tasty
but
lacking
any
significant
umph
to
the
malts
and
softness
to
the
body
that
could
really
make
carry
it
all
and
make
this
one
shine
it
is
probably
better
with
pub
grub
but
is
pretty
alright
standing
alone
d
this
beer
is
quite
quaffable
a
nice
basic
beer
to
keep
on
the
short
list
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
and
places
much
sticky
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
quite
malty
with
toffee
and
caramel
being
dominant
in
the
nose
bready
with
faint
earthy
hops
round
out
the
nose
taste
is
toffee
and
caramel
with
earthy
hops
and
hints
of
pine
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bubbly
sweet
mouthfeel
decent
brew
thats
easy
to
drink
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
glad
to
have
tried
it
not
bad
poured
a
copperyamber
color
clear
with
a
small
cap
of

biscuity

light
sugary
malts
woody
taste
followed
the
aroma
pretty
closely
with
toasted
bread
grainy
light
sweet
malts
woody
and
a
bit
well
coppery
actually
as
in
metallic
hops
came
in
a
bit
pithy
with
what
seemed
like
some
funky
notes
not
overly
flavorful
lightmedium
body
and
moderately
drinkable
but
just
a
bit
too
bland
and
the
metallic
taste
and
subsequent
aftertaste
didnt
make
a
good
or
lasting
impression
with
me
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
very
sessionable
pretty
bland
overall
but
still
a
good
quality
brew
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
a
great
session
brew
pours
the
color
of
a
new
penny
with
a
prominent
tanish
head
that
slowly
resides
smells
pure
high
quality
rich
malty
unique
flavor
is
less
hop
driven
than
a
traditional
american
pale
ale
but
not
as
malty
as
a
more
traditional
english
pale
it
as
found
a
happy
medium
somewhere
on
the
spectrum
of
daily
drink
ales
rich
velvety
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
pairs
well
with
anything
from
the
grill
just
shy
of
medium
carbonation
with
a
thin
but
still
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
summer
session
beer
for
someone
whos
not
quite
ready
for
the
bigger
flavors
out
there
still
enjoy
it
on
occasion
and
much
prefer
it
to
ocs
summer
ale
this
is
a
overall
good
beer
we
will
not
let
the
mouth
feel
stop
us
from
drinking
this
will
go
nice
with
some
ribs
pork
of
course
really
enjoyed
the
beer
at
5
4
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
poured
a
1
5
offwhite
head
which
floated
a
merengue
for
a
while
color
in
masstone
looks
more
like
a
hazy
burnt
sienna
than
copper
but
when
held
to
the
light
the
copper
came
out
not
much
smell
even
after
it
warmed
a
little
just
a
little
malt
taste
and
body
were
surprisingly
kind
of
watery
just
a
little
malt
again
there
is
a
subtle
bitter
finish
which
persists
its
ok
but
not
at
all
what
i
expected
maybe
it
was
just
my
sample
o
very
drinkable
and
looks
nice
in
a
pint
glass
interesting
flavor
oda
step
down
from
the
word
solid
lightyears
from
great
just
another
beer
i
will
remember
i
have
tried
but
not
remember
anything
beyond
such
point
decent
head
dull
amber
to
orange
in
color
smells
delicious
and
enticing
not
a
very
full
mouthfeel
mostly
muted
hard
to
discern
any
particular
flavors
other
than
a
hint
of
brownsugarish
sweetness
overall
a
very
standard
type
of
beer
with
nothing
bad
to
say
nor
nothing
terribly
exciting
to
report
amber
color
with
a
nice
silkey
off
white
head
good
retention
scent
of
light
roast
and
noble
hop
nice
malt
body
melded
well
with
noble
hop
slight
chalkiness
over
all
a
good
beer
and
a
style
i
wish
was
more
common
this
one
is
tasty
enough
and
something
i
dont
mind
drinking
if
its
around
but
its
not
something
id
seek
out
like
much
of
otter
creeks
lineup
its
one
of
those
beers
thats
perfectly
adequate
but
nothing
spectacular
cheers
overall
this
is
a
good
copper
ale
and
grows
on
the
drinker
as
the
bottle
empties
the
flavors
do
not
decrease
as
happens
in
some
beers
but
become
more
noticeable
and
refined
the
semiburnt
notes
can
get
a
little
overpowering
if
the
beer
is
drunk
too
quickly
making
this
an
excellent
sipping
beverage
i
find
it
strange
that
both
otter
creek
and
long
trail
two
relatively
big
breweries
in
vt
have
a
yearround
altbier
for
my
tastes
otter
creeks
offering
is
greatly
superior
it
is
certainly
not
an
exciting
beer
but
i
would
not
mind
having
in
my
fridge
more
often
o
decent
but
nothing
i
would
seek
to
try
again
thanks
for
the
extra
dsgolovin
this
beer
seems
absurdly
drinkable
and
pretty
much
seems
to
me
to
perform
its
duties
as
an
alt
very
well
nothing
spectacular
but
a
good
beer
for
the
sake
of
having
a
beer
12oz
bottle
pours
a
murky
dirty
copper
color
with
a
small
amount
of
head
zero
lacing
aroma
is
earthy
and
malty
sort
of
sweet
and
sour
smelling
maybe
a
bit
of
caramel
taste
is
bready
more
of
that
tangy
flavor
i
smelled
earlier
earthy
flavor
a
bit
watery
and
thin
but
easy
to
drink
and
an
alright
beer
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
one
decent
mix
pack
beer
but
not
worth
grabbing
on
its
own
overall
an
average
easy
drinkin
beer
this
is
really
refreshing
yet
bitter
in
a
way
that
demands
you
draw
another
sip
for
the
style
i
think
this
is
excellent
its
called
a
copper
and
i
think
thats
a
perfect
description
for
the
sensation
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
with
some
fish
and
chips
clear
orange
amber
colour
with
a
thin
cap
of
foam
that
settled
quickly
to
a
collar
mild
aroma
earthy
malty
with
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
toasty
with
faint
hops
moderate
bitterness
that
lingered
a
little
juicy
citrusy
up
front
malty
midpalate
definite
grapefruit
character
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
fairly
dry
overall
pretty
decent
easy
drinking
with
nice
flavor
a
little
fruitier
than
i
expected
copper
colored
clear
no
head
or
lace
plentiful
carbonation
muted
malt
aroma
with
a
candy
like
characteristic
medium
carbonation
feel
flavor
leans
toward
the
malt
side
with
the
same
candy
like
quality
in
the
middle
some
bitterness
in
the
back
but
all
in
all
a
mediocre
brew
with
nothing
descriminating
it
from
the
thousands
of
other
pale
ales
great
bold
malt
flavor
but
didnt
forget
a
good
dose
at
the
end
to
keep
the
hopheads
happy
overall
a
well
rounded
easy
drinking
brew
of
a
style
that
i
havent
had
many
of
i
found
the
bitterness
moderate
but
it
may
be
a
little
too
much
for
those
very
sensitive
to
it
recommend
trying
this
one
o
it
was
ok
nothing
amazing
liked
the
fruit
flavor
but
the
chalky
mouthfeel
wasnt
great
tasted
warm
going
down
makes
me
think
this
would
be
nice
for
autumn
i
was
missing
the
hop
presence
on
this
one
dry
finish
which
i
liked
but
otherwise
empty
and
tasting
watery
in
the
middle
a
decent
copper
but
nothing
exceptional
nothing
special
here
move
along
if
there
is
one
beer
in
otter
creeks
lineup
that
is
in
need
of
overhaul
its
this
one
since
when
does
altbier
mean
boring
uninspired
ale
thats
the
vibe
i
got
with
this
one
will
not
have
again
12

light
short
finish
nothing
exciting
about
this
brew
overall
this
seemed
to
be
a
very
very
plain
beer
flavors
seemed
meshed
together
no
defining
characteristics
noted
at
all
it
drinks
fine
but
nothing
stood
out
d
drinkable
esp
for
those
who
enjoy
the
altbier
style
vermont
offers
many
more
superior
beers
than
this
one
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
smooth
i
had
this
beer
years
ago
and
remember
loving
it
however
i
grabbed
a
six
pack
the
other
day
and
had
a
different
experience
it
poured
out
a
beautiful
copper
color
which
was
the
only
thing
that
seemed
the
same
the
smell
was
graining
and
floral
but
not
awesome
the
taste
was
pretty
similar
had
a
nice
head
on
it
but
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
me
all
in
all
a
half
way
decent
beer
but
definitely
the
same
as
it
was
before
not
sure
if
its
a
new
recipe
or
a
off
batch
guess
ill
have
to
pick
it
up
a
six
pack
again
ina
few
months
and
find
out
87
d
good
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
im
not
too
impressed
though
drinkability
although
this
is
drinkble
th
carbonation
could
be
too
much
after
a
few
however
when
drinking
in
a
mixpack
is
good
d
robust
yet
smooth
flowing
otter
creek
copper
ale
pours
with
a
orangeamber
colour
the
head
dies
away
quickly
but
some
lacing
remains
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
tastes
like
yeastiness
and
some
maltiness
starts
out
crisp
and
hoppy
there
is
also
a
hint
of
sweet
maltiness
the
finish
is
crisp
like
a
lager
this
is
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
beer
but
its
not
that
interesting
drinkable
but
disappointed
drink
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
would
make
a
good
oktoberfest
brew
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
im
happy
i
tried
it
appearance
is
a
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
with
some
time
has
some
lacing
smell
has
malt
sugar
some
hops
a
nice
aroma
overall
ocbs
copper
ale
tastes
slightly
hoppy
but
also
watery
with
a
tinge
of
a
bitter
finish
mf
is
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
good
as
it
goes
down
easily
a
nice
option
after
a
day
on
the
mountain
in
vermont
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
for
a
sunday
afternoon
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
a
six
pack
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
d
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
love
it
and
would
probably
only
ever
have
one
in
an
evening
on
ode
to
vermont
beers
this
beer
is
what
got
me
to
love
craft
brews
i
was
a
poor
college
student
and
it
was
love
at
first
sip
the
amber
color
so
clear
and
defined
the
sweet
yet
malted
aroma
got
my
attention
then
the
flavor
was
exactly
what
i
needed
at
the
right
time
not
overly
hoppy
or
malty
or
sweet
it
was
just
right
thank
you
otter
creek
for
helping
be
the
person
i
am
today
d
nice
but
it
does
sit
a
little
heavy
the
sweetness
is
a
little
strong
as
well
taste
is
a
bit
of
an
upgrade
from
the
aroma
the
hop
profile
is
a
b
it
more
bright
with
some
more
citrus
noticeable
the
malt
offering
is
upped
a
bit
as
well
the
caramel
is
more
noticeable
balancing
a
bit
better
with
the
dry
bready
character
from
the
aroma
does
down
too
easy
if
you
know
what
i
mean
starts
off
with
a
bang
visually
and
aroma
wise
but
lets
you
down
from
there
d
a
niceley
balanced
beer
i
think
of
fall
when
i
drink
this
brew
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hops
taste
is
dominated
by
hops
some
malts
considerable
bitterness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
d
decent
brew
although
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
an
altbier
good
for
a
couple
d
very
drinkable
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
session
drinkability
im
not
sure
if
this
is
what
the
brewers
were
going
for
but
its
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinking
beer
but
the
taste
turns
me
off
from
having
another
drinkability
is
good
i
had
two
of
them
with
a
california
type
mediterranean
pizza
with
capers
artichokes
and
fresh
tomatoes
the
beer
complimented
the
food
well
would
be
a
good
session
beer
too
this
is
a
drinkable
altbier
goes
well
with
a
chocolate
dessert
or
grilled
meat
great
sessions
brew
too
d
very
drinkable
i
liked
how
the
flavors
blended
nice
beer
with
a
moderate
abv
drinkability
great
beer
clean
crisp
flavorful
and
refreshing
very
lightly
hopped
and
a
nice
dry
finish
a
very
drinkable
altbier
d
my
first
experience
with
an
altbier
so
im
not
exactly
sure
what
to
compare
this
to
it
doesnt
help
that
the
altbier
description
on
this
site
doesnt
describe
much
either
id
certainly
drink
a
few
more
of
these
in
the
future
but
id
probably
save
them
for
fall
campfire
drinking
good
representation
of
the
altbier
style
would
recommend
it
d
one
is
enjoyable
but
i
would
have
to
pass
on
a
second
too
sweet
for
me
drinkability
solid
balanced
pleasant
ale
that
goes
down
with
ease
drinkability
very
drinkable
excellent
session
beer
would
try
again
and
would
try
other
beers
from
this
brewery
pours
a
clear
copper
orange
with
minimal
head
different
from
other
reviews
so
not
sure
if
just
this
6
pack
nice
appearance
nonetheless
not
much
aroma
that
i
am
picking
up
so
the
flavor
was
surprisingly
tasty
with
caramel
bready
candy
tastes
bit
of
alcohol
towards
the
end
easy
drinking
with
nice
warming
feel
and
nicely
balanced
carbonation
could
go
for
several
of
these
overall
overall
the
beer
was
pretty
good
as
i
said
its
easy
going
and
very
drinkable
enough
hops
to
satisfy
hop
lovers
and
enough
balance
with
malts
for
me
to
enjoy
taste
is
of
malts
and
earth
flavors
provides
a
really
dry
finish
not
bitter
but
neither
sweet
not
a
bad
beer
easy
drinking
though
not
my
first
stop
for
a
brown
thatd
be
a
sn
brown
drinkability
a
solid
balanced
pleasant
ale
that
goes
down
with
ease
taste
is
malty
sweet
honey
with
a
little
bit
of
depth
to
the
malt
flavors
hops
are
there
on
the
finish
along
with
a
little
bit
of
toast
for
me
this
one
tastes
more
like
an
amber
ale
than
an
altbier
and
an
above
average
one
at
that
is
there
some
maris
otter
malt
in
here
giving
it
that
earthy
and
biscuity
flavor
maybe
some
special
b
a
decent
drinker
here
quite
sessionable
nutty
flavor
with
strong
complex
maltiness
earthy
background
with
a
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
slight
sour
finish
body
is
watery
not
quite
big
enough
for
the
flavor
this
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
just
not
quite
as
enjoyable
as
it
should
be
d
again
in
case
you
didnt
understand
my
opinion
this
beer
is
not
good
though
it
has
some
interesting
elements
i
would
question
the
judgment
and
sanity
of
anyone
who
strongly
advocates
this
strangely
i
have
had
it
a
number
of
times
despite
the
fact
that
i
dont
like
it
my
friends
dont
like
it
and
the
only
people
i
know
who
are
down
with
it
are
literally
from
vermont
would
like
to
see
a
little
bit
more
of
everything
with
this
beer
maybe
give
it
another
shot
if
they
tweaked
the
recipe
a
bit
would
like
to
try
it
again
but
its
a
long
ways
away
bottom
line
ive
definitely
enjoyed
playing
around
with
this
beer
6pack
but
its
definitely
not
on
my
favorites
list
and
probably
not
one
that
i
will
buy
again
apologies
to
the
bros
rave
reviews
of
it
md
smooth
drinking
here
brisk
carbonation
and
not
heavy
at
all
the
bitter
hop
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
detracting
a
bit
from
drinkability
though
this
beer
went
great
with
a
burger
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
fairly
light
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
drinkable
beer
i
could
session
this
one
for
sure
cheers
pours
a
clear
golden

yellow
tinted

retension
and
a
bit
of
lacing

the
glass
hops
along
with
a
breadytoasty
grain

present
in
the

taste
is
slightly
bitter
upfront
from
the
hops
but
also
includes
a
bit
of
malt
and
grain
through
the
flavor
as
well
crisp
finish
to
this
light
bodied
highly
carbed
beer
overall
not
bad
served

great
copper

a
small
white
head
and
excellent
lacing
a
malty
aroma
hints
of
caramel
in
the
taste
and
a
slight
bittersour
finish
makes
a
very
good
session
beer
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
better
on
tap
than
from
a
bottle
on
tap
at
west
on

in
west
roxbury
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
clear
orange
color
no
visible
head
but
good
carbonation
not
much
smell
but
taste
was
clean
and
appealing
malty
at
first
but
then
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
drinkability
is
what
i
give
this
beer
the
best
marks
for
its
just
an
extremely
easy
brew
to
drink
went
down
before
i
got
my
meal
very
sessionable
and
pairs
easily
with
food

this
is
a
great
all
year
round
beer
i
will
look
for
this
again
looking
forward
to
trying
the
raspberry
brown
thanks
bill
i
recieved
a
12
pack
of
this
in
a
local
beer
trade
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
mini
snifter
i
got
a
generous
2
inch
thick
white
head
clean
copper
appearance
and
lacing
stuck
to
the
glass
smell
was
not
very
noticable
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
between
roasted
nutlike
malty
flavor
and
hoppy
profile
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
smooth
very
drinkable
brew
a
humble
all
around
good
beer
glad
i
made
it
the
otter
creek
copper
ale
makes
for
a
pleasant
quaff
on
a
warm
afternoon
be
it
on
the
banks
of
the
otter
creek
or
the
rhine
river
mouthfeeldrinkability
good
very
crisp
tasty
easydrinking
with
fullflavor
i
had
more
than
a
couple
and
really
enjoyed
them
worth
seeking
out
smells
same
as
most
ales
of
this
variety
taste
was
very
pleasant
on
the
palate
and
left
no
aftertaste
might
be
considered
a
little
sharp
to
some
but
i
enjoyed
it
worth
serious
consideration
t
just
like
the
scent
it
has
a
strong
malt
taste
to
it
with
a
caramel
undertones
its
a
fullbodied
beer
its
solid
in
many
ways
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
either
quite
drinkable
overall
with
great
balance
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
dissipated
to
a
collar
the
aroma
wasnt
very
strong
i
couldnt
get
much
of
anything
the
taste
was
bitter
like
a
copper
penny
in
your
mouth
hmmm
is
that
why
they
call
it
copper
ale
the
feel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
was
ok
an
average
tasting
beer
at
best
d
quite
pleasant
with
smooth
features
and
a
hint
of
malt
complexity
feels
european
in
some
way
notes
as
the
only
altbier
ive
had
ive
got
nothing
to
compare
it
to
its
got
a
sharp
bitterness
to
it
thats
fairly
pleasant
and
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
kolsch
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
go
figure
the
head
is
an
inch
and
a
half
of
solid
white
foam
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
and
toast
it
isnt
the
most
aromatic
beer
out
there
but
what
is
there
is
very
nice
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
a
little
more
pronounced
i
like
how
it
is
thoroughly
malt
without
being
overly
heavy
of
overly
sticky
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
the
texture
is
very
silky
which
i
would
not
expect
from
an
altbier
but
it
really
makes
things
nice
overall
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
the
longer
i
sip
the
more
i
like
it
i
could
easily
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
without
getting
bored
pours
an
attractive
clear
copper
with
a
medium
sized
offwhite
head
that
smells
of
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
leafy
hops
taste
has
a
nice
orange
zest
that
slightly
overshadows
the
malts
this
a
great
food
and
session
beer
one
that
i
keep
coming
back
to
time
and
again
all
in
all
it
was
solid
still
strong
from
being
in
the
bottle
so
long
i
was
surprised
pours
a
clear
amber
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
hops
and
yeast
fits
the
style
of
an
altbier
mouth
feel
is
really
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
sweet
malt
yeast
grain
and
slight
roasted
malt
overall
a
little
watery
and
weak
in
body
but
nice
drinkability
doug
pours
a
bright
golden
copper
hue
with
a
nice
head
and
a
strong
column
of
bubbling
the
aroma
is
caramel
malts
and
faint
minty
hops
when
this
beer
is
cold
it
has
a
strong
metallic
twang
on
the
front
and
middle
of
the
palate
but
as
it
warms
the
caramel
and
crystal
malts
come
up
front
with
a
more
grassy
hop
profile
mixed
in
great
toasted
malt
palate
with
some
balancing
hops
but
there
needs
to
be
more
sweetness
for
this
to
be
my
idea
of
an
altbier
another
highly
drinkable
offering
from
otter
creek
nothing
to
go
wild
over
but
solid
all
around
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
the
smell
is
of
earthy
notes
and
piney
hops
with
some
fruit
notes
the
smell
is
very
nice
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
there
is
no
fruit
notes
and
a
very
faint
piney
hop
taste
that
is
almost
nonexistant
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
it
is
a
little
harsh
the
overall
drinkability
is
okay
the
color
and
smell
start
the
beer
off
promising
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
fall
short
highly
recommended
this
is
the
third
ive
had
and
they
seem
to
taste
better
each
time
impressive
obviously
a
fresh
batch
this
has
the
octoberfest
beer
in
the
sampler
case
also
has
the
american
pale
ale
may
have
paid
a
few
extra
bucks
buying
it
here
in
pa
but
already
more
than
worth
it
d
pretty
good
taste
and
feel
are
alright
but
theres
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
and
the
smell
is
quite
nice
easily
a
good
session
beer
inviting
aroma
is
mainly
malty
with
a
strongly
yeasty
overtone
and
a
firm
ribbon
of
peanut
running
through
it
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
that
is
thick
if
not
persistent
taste
is
a
bit
wan
malty
with
an
undertone
of
peanut
and
tasty
if
not
outstanding
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
a
little
tingly
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
not
too
shabby
d
i
will
give
this
another
shot
hopefully
on
tap
or
in
a
growler
poured
into
a
mug
as
a
slightly
cloudy
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
solid
head
scent
is
very
light
maybe
a
hint
of
yeast
flavor
is
earthy
with
some
subdued
malt
flavors
a
bit
of
chewiness
at
the
end
but
overall
very
smooth
with
little
aftertaste
extremely
likeable
great
session
beer
with
great
complexity
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
2
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
grassy
and
sweet
the
flavor
is
full
and
smooth
a
bit
sweet
up
front
but
it
mellows
out
with
a
nice
balanced
flavor
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
avearage
carbonation
and
a
well
rounded
beer
that
would
go
well
with
most
foods
drinkability
is
very
good
i
am
sad
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
part
of
a
mix
a
six
it
leaves
a
really
good
taste
in
your
mouth
that
lingers
for
a
short
while
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
long
trail
ale
overall
a
great
beer
i
got
this
beer
as
part
of
a
mix
pack
that
i
highly
recommend
the
price
was
right
and
every
beer
was
good
i
would
certainly
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
low
price
and
an
excellent
ale
d
admittedly
im
not
wildly
familiar
with
altbiers
but
this
stuff
is
just
kind
of
gross
i
feel
like
im
choking
down
that
compostlike
taste
at
times
a
strange
experience
overall
that
i
dont
care
to
repeat
any
time
soon
this
is
way
too
drinkable
its
sweet
and
complex
and
i
keep
wanting
another
sip
slightly
hazed
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
frothy
beige
head
and
a
patchy
lace
spicy
nose
with
hint
of
hops
and
a
slight
note
of
caramel
taste
is
slightly
sweet
grainy
malt
caramel
and
spice
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
that
lingers
on
for
a
bit
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
holds
up
well
nicely
balanced
easy
to
drink
lots
of
taste
and
moderately
priced
its
a
buy
this
beer
was
served
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
a
nice
creamy
foamy
head
to
it
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
nose
is
faintly
malty
a
touch
musty
and
sweet
caramel
malts
this
beer
starts
out
with
the
caramel
malts
becomes
slightly
bready
then
finishes
with
bitter
hops
i
really
like
the
bitter
hop
finish
to
this
one
it
lingers
and
offsets
the
sweet
start
this
is
a
lighter
to
slight
medium
bodied
beer
slightly
more
carbonated
that
i
would
have
liked
goes
down
very
easily
for
me
this
beer
has
definite
drinkability
d
totally
drinkable
and
totally
refreshing
d
this
wasnt
too
bad
but
not
something
id
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
couple
of
bottles
of
more
runofthemill
than
anything
despite
me
dislike
of
the
taste
i
do
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
its
smooth
and
crisp
and
not
to
bad
in
the
long
run
i
wish
this
beer
had
more
character
because
to
me
its
just
dull
and
musty
worth
a
try
but
dont
spend
good
money
on
it
the
drink
is
on
the
light
side
of
mediumbodied
with
superb
carbonation
otter
creek
copper
ale
is
plenty
tasty
and
quite
a
refreshing
drink
on
a
warm
humid
spring
afternoon
a
very
good
beer
not
too
sweet
and
overbearing
i
love
the
caramel
sweetness
matched
with
the
hoppy
bitterness
a
great
representative
for
an
american
altbier
edit
upon
doing
my
homework
on
this
beers
intended
characteristics
malty
sweet
and
not
sour
i
have
to
say
this
beer
was
indeed
infected
just
one
very
flavorful
beer
worth
seeking
out
this
paired
with
an
array
of
wings
ranging
from
garlic
parmesean
to
spicy
buffalo
to
bourbon
bbq
and
it
was
great
on
its
own
as
well
otter
creek
copper
ale
is
a
very
versatile
brew
which
will
satisfy
the
malt
fans
out
there
with
enough
balance
to
satisate
most
any
craft
enthusiast
a
great
ale
at
a
good
friends
party
for
mardi
gras
here
in
burlington
thanks
jon
anthony
i
drank
a
bottle
of
this
ubiquitous
favorite
the
color
was
copperamber
the
onefinger
head
offwhite
the
retention
subpar
and
the
lacing
off
the
collar
decent
the
aroma
was
very
faint
but
pleasant
a
mix
of
caramel
malt
and
some
hop
bitterness
the
flavors
started
semisweet
with
caramel
malt
and
toasted
malt
followed
by
nuts
and
a
crisp
hoppy
finish
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
at
the
end
was
twiggy
and
a
bit
woody
whole
leaf
hops
sessionable
but
a
bit
boring
the
body
was
medium
the
carbonation
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
average
12oz
bottle
from
hannaford
pours
an
amber
body
with
a
thin
film
of
offwhite
head
caramel
characterizes
the
aroma
though
its
really
slight
rich
caramel
dominates
the
flavor
with
some
chocolate
and
fruit
notes
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
flavorful
enough
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
reasonably
decent
though
drinkability
i
can
see
having
this
beer
again
it
was
a
pretty
drinkable
offering
the
metallic
taste
kind
of
threw
me
off
track
a
bit
but
its
really
not
bad
at
all
i
would
have
again
pours
a
medium
amber
color
good
head
minor
lacing
very
hoppy
aroma
taste
is
strong
almost
overwhelming
heavy
hops
bitterness
not
my
cup
of
tea
had
a
hard
time
finishing
the
one
i
poured
maybe
personal
taste
unfortunately
ive
had
better
from
otter
creek
d
this
is
somewhat
interesting
i
wont
call
it
a
great
beer
but
its
got
a
unique
flavor
and
nice
balance
solid
and
pretty
sessionable
very
drinkable
flavorful
yet
smooth
and
clean
well
done
drinkability
is
very
good
extremely
well
balanced
with
nice
clean
structure
definitely
calls
for
more
than
one
overall
good
drinkable
beer
slight
bitter
finish
drinkability
quality
and
i
would
drink
again
d
excellent
a
nice
session
ale
a
nice
little
session
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
as
noted
above
i
think
the
bottle
i
tried
was
bad
so
the
score
may
not
be
representative
if
i
get
a
hold
of
another
bottle
i
will
review
this
beer
again
this
beer
is
not
for
me
i
dont
like
the
overly
lemony
overtones
and
the
grassiness
d
not
inspiring
enough
to
be
considered
truly
sessionable
given
to
me
by
my
uncle
during
a
july
4
party
deep
red
hue
smells
pleasantly
malty
nothing
crazy
but
a
well
balanced
enjoyable
taste
quality
brew
here
would
you
like
another
chance
to
try
this
some
time
in
the
near
future
a
good
alternative
to
a
marzen
in
the
fall
like
a
maltier
and
softer
version
of
the
pale
ale
copper
ale
is
easier
to
drink
and
almost
likewise
exhibits
less
character
i
could
easily
pop
a
few
back
without
thinking
about
them
which
is
probably
why
it
is
otter
creeks
flagship
not
bad
pretty
good
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisp
with
a
smooth
finish
not
a
bad
beer
interesting
how
it
grew
on
me
as
i
continued
to
sip
alts
have
never
been
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
was
pleasant
to
drink
d
not
too
bad
i
could
drink
this
again
or
have
many
more
of
them
pretty
decent
brew
id
buy
it
again
this
brew
smells
very
malty
like
fresh
cooked
ginger
snaps
pours
to
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
slight
orange
tinge
head
is
macro
bubble
and
fades
quickly
the
taste
starts
as
sweet
like
a
marzen
but
is
quickly
followed
by
a
gradual
hopping
that
starts
bittersweet
in
combination
with
the
carbonation
the
finish
is
more
bitter
but
then
gets
overtaken
by
the
maltiness
this
is
a
flavorful
alt
not
at
all
balanced
at
the
point
of
attack
but
then
why
should
it
be
delicious
another
solid
otter
creek
offering
here
with
the
copper
ale
interesting
enough
it
pours
a
nice
copper
color
and
has
a
copperymetallic
sort
of
taste
to
it
in
a
good
way
though
may
be
hard
to
have
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
if
having
a
few
its
a
nice
tasty
beer
id
come
back
to
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
not
great
but
a
good
sessionable
ale
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
those
seeking
a
soft
beer
need
to
go
somewhere
else
flavors
peak
strongly
then
fade
to
the
next
layer
nice
beer
well
crafted
and
consistent
in
flavor
something
that
ive
gone
back
to
meaning
at
least
a
couple
of
6s
every
year
for
about
10
years
thanks
to
my
friend
for
having
it
in
the
fridge
a
great
reminder
that
while
there
are
so
many
new
ones
out
there
to
choose
from
it
is
important
and
actually
worthwhile
to
return
to
support
the
local
brewer
who
has
been
doing
it
so
well
for
so
long
i
know
what
my
next
6
purchase
is
going
to
be
this
is
not
exactly
a
hard
beer
to
polish
off
the
feel
is
watery
but
with
some
minor
ale
body
it
could
use
some
more
body
to
make
the
flavors
stick
around
a
little
longer
its
a
solid
ale
not
amazing
but
drinkable
and
mild
malty
and
a
tad
burnt
this
poured
a
clear
copper
with
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
roasted
barley
malt
and
earthy
copper
hops
with
a
bit
of
nutty
malt
it
tasted
like
rusty
and
earthy
copper
hops
with
robust
roasted
barley
malt
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
clean
and
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
nice
clean
flavor
that
was
easily
to
drink
however
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
hops
bite
a
nice
copper
color
to
it
topped
with
a
good
head
which
lelf
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
taste
was
a
refreshing
with
sweet
spiced
flavor
slightly
hoppy
bitter
notes
at
the
end
with
a
clean
finish
a
touch
fruity
but
not
too
much
perhaps
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
a
good
overall
balance
to
this
beer
and
something
id
look
forward
to
having
again
a
great
american
beer
a
great
altbier
and
the
best
otter
creek
offering
available
drinkability
good
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
excellent
balance
and
flavor
sessionable
highly
recommended
unique
thanks
to
csniezek
for
sending
this
my
way
a
good
tasting
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
again
good
session
beer
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
d
one
of
the
better
beers
from
this
brewery
pretty
drinkable
flavor
is
a
wellbalanced
blend
of
malt
and
hops
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thinwatery
but
the
flavor
is
all
there
i
could
see
myself
latching
onto
this
as
one
of
my
favorite
local
brews
if
i
lived
in
the
area
otter
creek
copper
ale
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
malty
the
hops
really
jump
out
at
me
with
this
beer
but
there
is
a
really
nice
mix
of
malt
that
balances
this
beer
really
well
quiite
enjoyable
and
tastes
along
with
relatively
low
alcohol
ill
seek
this
out
again
not
a
bad
beer
d
really
drinkable
would
be
a
perfect
session
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
beers
its
tasty
and
crisp
but
not
overly
challenging
it
goes
as
well
with
subs
as
with
cheese
but
i
usually
drink
it
on
its
own
from
the
bottle
in
fact
i
dont
think
ive
ever
poured
it
into
a
glass
so
my
appearance
rating
is
based
strictly
on
the
bottle
and
guesswork
im
never
ashamed
to
have
it
in
my
fridge
i
probably
drink
it
too
cold
its
a
comfortable
beer
that
i
dont
have
to
think
about
too
hard
which
is
perfect
for
after
work
a
decent
offering
from
what
seems
to
be
a
decent
craft
brewer
my
altbier
experience
is
limited
and
ive
not
had
an
altbier
that
has
been
this
hoppy
and
void
of
roasty
elements
but
this
is
a
decent
offering
and
im
glad
ive
got
a
few
more
to
enjoy
i
could
cdrink
this
bad
boy
all
day
long
it
is
a
great
festival
and
picnic
pairing
color
aroma
head
retention
taste
its
all
there
wrapped
up
in
a
fine
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
creamy
lightly
carbonated
dry
finish
that
left
a
nice
taste
in
the
mouth
good
example
of
this
style
a
great
summerspring
beer
which
could
definitely
be
sessioned
would
gladly
enjoy
a
six
pack
drinkability
knocked
down
due
to
the
midbeer
development
of
astringent
metal
flavor
mfd
slightly
carbonated
with
a
smooth
almost
oily
mouthfeel
the
ale
coated
the
mouth
well
and
hung
around
the
long
after
the
swallow
which
would
have
been
good
if
the
taste
would
have
been
better
tasted
like
i
was
drinking
a
subpar
ipa
with
a
handful
of
pennies
in
my
mouth
i
did
not
enjoy
this
ale
would
not
purchase
it
in
the
future
overall
this
is
nice
beer
that
i
could
have
several
of
as
its
name
implies
pours
a
picture
perfect
copper
color
great
clarity
and
a
quarter
inch
of
head
that
just
sticks
to
the
sides
and
soon
falls
aromas
are
just
a
touch
of
toasty
grain
amber
and
munich
malts
no
fruit
and
some
floral
notes
from
the
hops
very
clean
overall
on
the
palate
there
is
a
medium
caramel
flavor
lightly
toasted
finishing
with
a
rich
biscuity
flavor
and
bitterness
from
the
hops
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
but
also
a
touch
thin
and
watery
no
problems
or
faults
but
also
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
had
this
one
in
a
sample
pack
poured
with
a
coppergold
tint
and
settled
with
a
murky
appearance
the
aromas
had
a
citrus
almost
lemony
fragrance
but
the
overall
structure
was
a
hoppyish
bread
smell
with
good
amounts
of
malt
the
taste
was
nice
and
sweet
with
more
apparent
citrus
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
stable
and
rich
allowing
it
to
be
refreshing
and
relaxing
overall
a
nice
generally
good
feeling
drink
not
my
style
but
the
hop
picks
up
the
taste
enough
to
make
it
drinkable
this
was
my
first
altbier
but
it
certainly
wont
be
the
last
the
beer
poured
a
nice
light
copper
color
the
head
was
quite
small
but
it
left
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
the
taste
was
a
very
pleasing
blend
of
sweet
malts
and
maybe
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
with
the
perfect
balance
of
hops
on
the
finish
it
was
very
drinkable
i
want
to
get
another
drinkability
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
i
tried
otter
creeks
white
sail
witbier
and
found
it
to
be
less
than
satisfactory
however
this
style
more
than
makes
up
for
it
d
like
i
said
this
is
a
great
all
around
beer
a
perfect
compliment
to
a
cooler
day
as
i
was
finishing
the
beer
i
read
that
this
is
styled
by
german
alt
beers
makes
sense
to
pair
it
up
on
a
cool
october
day
beautiful
penny
copper
color
to
this
beer
which
poured
out
to
almost
zero
head
in
my
pint
glass
extremely
easy
to
just
gulp
this
down
because
it
is
so
smooth
it
does
have
a
small
hop
bite
that
lingers
briefly
after
you
sallow
but
the
main
flavor
is
a
nice
toasty
malt
flavor
would
go
great
with
a
full
breakfast
meal
poured
into
a
samuel
adam
boston
lager
glass
formed
a
34
eggshell
head
over
the
clear
amber
brew
head
recedes
sedately
with
lasting
lace
aroma
is
wellbalanced
taste
mirrors
the
nose
nutty
maltiness
upfront
and
a
moderately
intense
citrus
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
nice
fallback
if
not
a
first
choice
when
looking
for
a
sessionable
product
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
because
of
the
dryness
overall
not
too
bad
but
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
a
couple
poured
a
copper
color
with
almost
no
head
and
that
with
a
very
fresh
born
on
date
grainy
aromas
with
a
touch
of
leather
in
the
nose
the
taste
starts
with
spicy
hops
then
a
graininess
like
wasa
crackers
and
crisp
dry
malt
a
tad
sweet
right
before
the
finish
and
then
a
long
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
crackery
and
a
bit
spicy
but
falls
off
a
bit
this
is
a
pleasant
session
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
d
good
drinkability
with
a
great
complexity
of
flavor
a
great
fall
style
beer
with
a
very
good
flavor
a
very
solid
but
not
knockyoursocksoff
beer
i
will
definitely
track
this
one
down
again
d
very
nice
sessionable
amber
style
ale
bottle
says
inspired
by
alts
but
seems
a
little
hoppy
for
an
alt
definitely
worth
trying
i
would
buy
it
again
pours
a
paler
copper
than
expected
but
certainly
is
copper
in
a
muted
rather
pale
amber
kinda
way
head
of
foam
and
surprisingly
white
with
a
yellow
tinge
that
holds
lacing
aroma
is
predominantly
hops
and
very
clean
not
a
favorite
aroma
but
a
good
aroma
taste
is
light
and
malty
hops
make
a
showing
as
does
a
distinct
toasted
flavor
this
is
like
a
less
intense
and
more
sessionable
version
of
redhook
esb
a
beer
i
really
like
but
im
unsure
i
want
a
less
intense
version
flavors
are
great
though
simple
as
that
mouthfeel
is
watery
aimed
for
sessionability
so
its
acceptable
drinkability
is
excellent
its
a
well
balanced
beer
and
id
consider
stocking
it
though
its
rather
close
to
esb
as
mentioned
drinks
fairly
good
compares
favorably
to
some
alts
i
had
over
in
germany
too
dang
dry
to
session
on
i
dont
visit
alts
often
enough
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
when
i
head
to
the
store
it
seems
like
theres
just
too
many
seasonals
and
special
releases
to
keep
up
with
that
it
keeps
me
from
what
i
should
be
drinking
more
sessionable
brews
that
being
said
i
still
found
the
beer
to
be
quite
drinkable
it
has
that
nice
copper
color
but
little
lace
there
was
some
sweet
bread
smell
that
kept
me
interested
and
the
taste
actually
improves
as
it
warms
unfortunately
i
could
catch
more
of
the
the
watery
flat
finish
to
every
drink
is
the
recurring
taste
no
matter
how
well
it
hit
initially
hit
the
tongue
medium
bodied
as
promised
it
went
down
smoothly
and
imparted
some
good
clean
caramel
before
the
aftertaste
immediately
downgraded
it
again
an
average
beer
that
i
would
not
buy
but
would
be
thrilled
to
drink
if
offered
one
the
second
offering
was
their
alt
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
reddishgold
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
a
sour
caramel
w
faint
hints
of
darker
fruits
as
it
warms
very
little
hop
aroma
as
well
a
crisp
strangely
tart
malty
nutlike
flavor
at
first
then
the
flavor
thins
out
quickly
leaving
a
watered
down
mostly
munichcaramel
flavor
behind
a
bit
of
citrusy
hop
in
there
as
well
a
dry
med
body
w
mild
carbonation
could
be
thinner
to
match
the
lighter
flavor
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
not
my
top
choice
for
an
alt
at
all
say
that
three
times
fast
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
nothing
really
spectaculat
just
a
decent
beer
i
would
go
to
it
in
a
pinch
for
sure
but
faced
with
other
options
i
would
probably
not
no
drink
by
date
on
this
one
but
pours
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
many
rising
bubbles
topped
by
a
two
finger
white
head
this
one
has
a
good
amount
of
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
both
sweet
and
sour
with
some
good
hop
smells
and
a
decent
amount
of
sweet
malt
aroma
the
taste
has
abundant
hop
bitterness
and
medium
malt
flavors
that
is
very
well
blended
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
over
and
over
d
not
bad
but
not
the
best
balanced
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
i
think
but
overall
a
drinkable
brew
this
is
a
very
average
beer
that
is
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
it
pours
a
copper
color
clear
decently
carbonated
some
head
some
retention
the
smell
is
bready
malts
caramel
some
floral
aromas
the
taste
is
all
about
the
malts
youll
get
your
floral
malts
some
dry
malt
flavors
some
burnt
molasses
flavors
too
its
okay
nothing
special
just
okay
mouthfeel
is
what
you
would
come
to
expect
from
an
american
malty
micro
and
the
drinkability
is
a
plus
because
the
beer
makes
no
real
statement
one
way
or
another
you
cant
go
wrong
here
but
dont
expect
much
either
the
style
is
generally
reasonably
subtle
but
this
is
more
indistinct
than
nuanced
the
thin
character
detracts
from
what
might
have
been
a
decent
flavor
profile
the
lightness
of
being
does
help
make
it
drinkable
but
i
know
i
could
do
better
in
my
search
for
a
tasty
alt
i
guess
ill
finish
the
six
when
i
feel
like
having
a
beer
i
dont
have
to
think
about
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
has
a
deep
gold
color
and
nice
pleasant
smell
the
taste
is
fantastic
with
what
seems
to
be
an
aftertaste
of
butterscotch
or
caramel
i
will
buy
this
product
again
although
i
dont
think
you
will
be
able
to
drink
many
at
one
sitting
one
of
my
new
favorites
pours
to
a
thin
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
copperorange
in
color
faint
aroma
of
noble
hops
like
a
german
pils
good
bitterness
delivers
mildly
nutty
malt
flavor
fairly
light
body
finishes
dry
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
with
something
like
firegrilled
pizza
but
by
itself
is
nothing
spectacular
a
thin
copper
colored
liquid
with
very
fine
carbonation
the
head
is
fairly
thin
with
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
maltynutlike
with
a
sour
overtone
sort
of
a
chemical
hint
the
flavor
jumps
out
as
fairly
crisp
malt
with
an
orange
citrus
feel
not
bad
an
interesting
blend
of
the
refreshing
citrus
and
the
mellow
side
of
the
maltnut
flavor
one
might
more
likely
anticipate
with
a
copper
ale
there
is
a
bitter
aftertaste
not
very
harsh
a
bit
dry
i
would
say
it
is
pretty
drinkable
but
this
strikes
me
as
more
of
a
good
change
up
beer
fairly
mild
without
being
bland
somewhat
unique
i
think
but
there
is
a
chemical
quality
that
keeps
popping
up
with
this
one
that
keeps
me
from
giving
it
a
better
review
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
hazy
yellowcopper
color
with
a
thin
frothy
head
smell
is
sweet
slightly
fruity
with
hints
of
caramel
the
taste
isnt
all
that
great
very
one
dimensional
for
having
six
malts
and
three
hops
lower
medium
bodied
brew
and
their
white
sail
is
good
too
they
also
have
growlers
that
seem
to
be
seasonal
and
regional
that
are
worth
a
shot
if
you
dig
the
ipa
scene
or
consider
yourself
a
hophead
you
will
probably
enjoy
this
one
its
just
not
for
me
its
tough
for
me
to
tell
how
much
this
beer
is
just
me
the
style
or
the
beer
itself
ive
liked
other
altbiers
so
its
probably
not
the
style
there
is
definitely
some
great
things
about
it
im
just
kind
of
put
off
by
that
undefinable
taste
im
positive
that
the
beer
isnt
light
spoiled
or
the
like
because
i
got
it
from
a
variety
pack
and
the
rest
are
fine
i
guess
ill
leave
this
review
as
a
personal
benchmark
and
have
to
review
it
some
other
time
this
beer
poured
a
nice
ambercopperish
color
hence
the
name
with
a
decent
head
that
left
lacing
behind
i
detect
hints
of
fruitiness
and
malt
in
it
which
id
expect
for
this
style
i
do
know
what
altbiers
are
the
taste
is
strong
and
malty
and
again
leaves
a
fruity
aftertaste
and
goes
down
quite
smooth
i
would
say
its
quite
drinkable
impressive
and
i
believe
it
would
make
a
great
session
ale
all
in
all
a
very
accessible
and
fairly
tasty
beer
and
i
do
prefer
it
to
similarly
scored
long
trail
ale
really
nice
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
pours
a
dull
copper
with
a
slight
white
head
smell
is
heavy
on
fruit
and
malt
i
really
dig
it
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
fruit
and
malt
slightly
drying
in
the
finish
very
pleasant
to
drink
and
i
think
pretty
right
on
for
the
style
a
really
nice
job
from
a
brewery
that
doesnt
get
enough
attention
this
was
something
ive
never
heard
of
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
it
poured
a
nice
gold
color
not
too
much
head
the
smell
was
as
you
expect
to
from
any
ale
it
had
a
hoppy
fruity
smell
to
it
however
when
i
got
to
the
taste
i
was
not
impressed
left
a
dry
taste
some
bitterness
and
distaste
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
one
a
smooth
and
refreshing
ale
a
decent
drinking
brew
nothing
outstanding
but
could
drink
a
few
of
them
overall
a
wellbalanced
and
easydrinking
beer
d
clean
thirst
quenching
beer
a
nice
alternative
to
a
ligher
pilsner
or
similar
lager
style
drinkabilityi
could
make
this
a
standard
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
d
superb
i
could
quaff
these
all
night
or
day
whatever
copper
colored
with
a
nice
white
head
a
hint
of
toasty
aroma
combined
with
some
floral
hop
notes
very
crisp
bready
malt
combining
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
not
much
bitterness
but
just
enough
very
clean
and
crisp
a
few
fruity
flavors
at
the
end
medium
body
very
drinkable
nothing
overwhelming
but
a
pretty
solid
session
beer
a
nice
lagerish
beer
that
is
smooth
enough
to
enjoy
enjoy
repeated
trials
it
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
with
too
much
hoppiness
which
is
nice
the
copperlike
color
and
clean
crisp
taste
help
make
this
one
enjoyable
for
one
and
all
after
an
few
runs
on
the
slopes
pleasnt
middle
ale
taste
smooth
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
which
i
dislike
in
an
ale
generally
speaking
i
prefer
fairly
strong
ales
and
beers
but
this
one
seems
to
be
of
decent
quality
without
excessive
hoppiness
recently
discovered
at
a
local
beer
discounter
so
further
review
may
continue
copper
colored
as
the
name
suggests
with
a
puffy
whitish
head
foaming
up
on
the
pour
great
clarity
good
head
retention
and
lacing
crispy
toasty
malt
aroma
a
bit
of
grain
and
restrained
floral
hops
softly
fruity
the
flavor
opens
with
grainy
cleanish
toasted
malt
followed
by
passive
apple
fruitiness
finishing
with
modest
floral
hoppage
im
curious
as
to
what
hops
they
use
because
they
seem
to
have
characteristics
of
american
english
to
german
varieties
pretty
straightforward
but
subtle
and
clean
a
good
sessioner
pours
a
clean
clear
orange
amber
straw
color
hue
nice
clean
white
head
disapates
to
a
nice
lace
ring
around
the
pint
smells
light
toasted
malt
sweetness
mild
hint
of
a
roasted
caramel
nice
malt
taste
mild
hint
of
hops
for
a
nice
well
rounded
balance
nice
hop
tang
in
the
finish
very
subtle
bread
like
yeast
mixed
in
good
drinkability
and
enjoyable
still
holds
true
from
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
back
in
college
at
st
mikes
good
offering
well
worth
trying
a
nice
crystal
amber
color
in
the
glass
glowing
orange
in
the
center
head
was
minimal
and
the
nose
was
disappointingly
nonapparent
just
a
slight
biscuit
aroma
to
be
found
the
taste
however
is
quite
pleasant
striking
a
perfect
balance
of
breadlike
maltiness
and
restrained
use
of
hops
rounded
out
with
a
nutty
caramel
flavor
finish
was
as
smooth
as
could
be
a
very
well
balanced
easy
drinking
altbier
and
a
great
session
standard
drinkability
overall
a
very
balanced
beer
except
for
the
smack
of
fruitiness
up
front
that
may
limit
its
drinkability
with
some
but
i
find
that
this
goes
down
smooth
pours
a
copper
color
huh
with
a
small
head
with
decent
retention
and
some
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
the
smell
was
not
very
strong
but
slightly
malty
from
what
i
did
smell
of
it
has
a
roasty
malty
taste
to
it
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
although
not
a
very
strong
taste
overall
feels
good
and
clean
in
the
mouth
without
very
much
carbonation
a
decent
beer
not
bad
but
not
amazing
mediumlight
body
moderate
carbonation
a
little
thin
watery
would
like
it
better
if
it
were
a
little
fuller
i
like
that
this
is
very
much
like
a
glass
of
bread
but
i
would
like
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
little
more
satisfying
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
another
and
it
would
be
an
acceptable
session
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
alt
this
is
a
staple
type
beer
very
sessionable
and
good
to
have
in
the
refrigerator
at
all
times
d
very
drinkable
almost
goes
down
too
easy
a
very
solid
beer
another
step
in
the
quest
for
the
perfect
craftbrewed
alt
rich
amber
color
with
a
nice
yet
quickly
disappearing
head
clear
malt
hits
your
nose
as
you
raise
the
glass
and
the
flavor
is
both
rich
malt
with
a
subtle
carmel
sweetness
that
is
at
the
same
time
just
bitter
enough
to
keep
you
wanting
more
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
presence
and
a
bit
more
carmel
than
some
others
but
both
of
these
flavors
pale
in
comparison
to
the
strong
malt
flavors
not
truly
complex
but
excellent
and
very
easy
drinking
extremely
true
to
both
the
ale
and
altbier
styles
and
would
likely
appeal
to
a
wide
range
of
beer
tastes
very
good
and
fairly
easy
to
find
where
i
am
so
this
one
moves
to
the
top
of
my
list
for
now
drinkability
average
offering
not
my
first
choice
for
an
altbier
but
not
one
id
pass
up
either
this
beer
poured
a
lighter
shade
of
red
there
is
little
head
the
smell
is
like
an
amber
ale
with
a
fair
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
a
litttle
more
bitter
than
typical
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
slight
hop
aftertaste
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
another
good
beer
from
vt
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
but
i
was
expecting
much
higher
carbonation
from
its
appearance
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
but
not
very
pleasing
to
me
some
strong
malt
flavors
without
corresponding
other
flavors
that
i
enjoy
d
none
of
the
flavors
are
exceptionally
strong
this
is
likely
appealing
in
the
long
run
basically
there
is
nothing
to
get
sick
of
so
i
can
imagine
drinking
these
all
night
long
mouthfeel
is
too
light
and
crisp
for
this
style
very
drinkable
because
of
its
light
body
and
crisp
taste
but
all
in
all
a
pretty
poor
example
of
this
style
in
my
opinion
a
decent
brew
but
trying
to
be
what
its
not
drinkability
meh
not
that
great
drinkability
this
makes
for
a
great
session
ale
overall
solid
offering
from
otter
creek
lots
of
flavor
and
complexity
recommended
a
beer
to
go
to
once
in
a
while
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
interesting
flavors
its
one
of
those
beers
that
grow
on
you
over
time
tasty
a
good
one
to
try
especially
if
you
like
the
style
clean
and
refreshing
and
not
overwhelming
in
any
way
i
love
the
way
this
beer
smells
even
if
not
a
complexity
symposium
the
toastiness
is
just
so
damn
fine
worth
checking
out
for
sure
this
pours
a
slightly
red
yellow
straw
with
a
small
head
that
is
gone
quickly
the
smell
has
a
nice
comforting
bakery
aroma
with
some
fruit
and
nuts
the
taste
has
some
fruit
and
spicesbut
it
also
has
alot
of
sweet
maltyness
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
good
beernot
greatbut
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
enjoy
the
balanced
flavors
its
too
bad
that
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
a
little
more
robust
overall
a
good
and
ejoyable
easy
drinking
beer
drinkability
why
bother
neither
the
aroma
nor
the
taste
is
especially
good
and
the
palate
is
a
bit
heavy
to
boot
the
appearance
of
otter
creek
copper
ale
is
very
good
it
has
a
great
copper
color
smells
good
too
the
taste
however
i
found
a
little
too
bitter
still
it
is
very
drinkable
but
is
not
my
favorite
otter
creek
brew
ive
been
to
the
brewery
and
sampled
many
of
their
beers
i
think
the
stovepipe
porter
is
their
best
12
ounce
bottle
otter
creek
copper
ale
pours
out
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
head
toasted
nutty
aroma
with
spicy
german
hops
clean
toasted
malt
flavor
a
touch
of
fruitiness
goes
well
with
the
nuttiness
finishes
with
a
spicy
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
medium
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
i
suspect
i
could
consume
a
sixer
of
this
beer
at
a
sitting
another
good
offering
from
otter
creek
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
their
beers
when
i
first
got
into
craft
beer
a
couple
years
ago
but
now
its
a
brewery
whose
beers
i
will
seek
out
i
hadnt
realized
prior
to
examining
this
bottle
closely
that
it
was
in
the
style
of
a
german
altbier
this
beer
pours
beautifully
with
a
clear
copper
color
and
a
nice
head
that
fades
a
bit
too
quickly
the
nose
is
full
of
grain
and
cereal
notes
but
it
also
has
a
slight
hop
aroma
the
hops
come
out
more
in
the
taste
where
they
balance
nicely
with
the
intense
malt
flavors
but
not
sweet
malt
flavors
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
very
much
like
an
english
brown
a
session
beer
but
with
a
more
appealing
hop
counterpoint
to
the
malt
recommended
medium
clear
body
mouthfeel
and
strong
crisp
carbonation
a
complex
and
most
interesting
beer
i
suspect
this
beer
would
be
sublime
with
a
hearty
sandwich
as
the
label
suggests
to
my
surprise
this
beer
is
nothing
like
double
bag
but
i
had
that
at
the
end
of
a
big
tasting
so
maybe
im
off
here
that
had
a
lot
more
malty
sweetness
than
im
picking
up
here
this
was
part
of
a
sampler
pack
the
label
said
brewed
on
10405
it
was
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
head
and
some
lacing
it
had
a
sweet
malty
odor
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
hoppy
background
that
lingered
mouthfeel
was
ok
some
carbonation
an
average
beer
but
drinkable
smells
of
amber
malts
lightly
carmelized
tastes
like
amber
malts
with
a
tough
of
hops
bitterness
no
hops
flavor
or
aroma
easy
drinking
but
this
is
not
what
id
call
an
altbier
itd
make
a
fine
amber
ale
but
its
definately
up
to
par
with
a
good
alt
this
was
a
good
all
around
beer
nothing
too
special
but
decent
as
a
part
of
a
sampler
or
good
as
a
session
the
taste
is
very
light
in
texture
but
the
maltiness
and
fruity
flavors
still
prevail
in
your
mouth
the
flavour
doesnt
last
though
and
a
bitter
taste
remains
after
awhile
theres
not
much
more
to
say
about
this
one
nothing
to
rave
about
and
nothing
to
complain
about
its
basic
but
tasty
ive
had
better
and
ive
had
worse
within
the
style
d
pretty
good
nothing
too
interesting
but
definitely
good
if
you
want
to
try
a
new
quencher
or
are
looking
for
a
different
session
beer
one
night
pours
a
mediumdark
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
creamy
head
with
good
retention
and
very
good
lacing
the
smell
is
very
inviting
a
nice
balance
of
complex
malts
and
citrus
herbal
hops
orange
pear
whole
wheat
bread
and
is
that
a
hint
clove
and
marjoram
im
picking
up
interesting
the
taste
is
a
little
grainier
than
expected
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
moderate
bitterness
that
comes
out
on
the
finish
and
transitions
from
citrus
to
more
of
floral
taste
as
it
fades
theres
a
light
metallic
tinge
in
there
it
has
a
medium
body
watery
texture
and
good
moderate
carbonation
i
remember
absolutely
loving
this
beer
when
i
was
first
getting
into
craft
beers
and
stronger
hops
yes
i
still
think
its
a
good
wellbalanced
beer
but
its
a
little
too
thinfeeling
and
the
flavor
is
a
little
weak
in
the
middle
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
solid
choice
but
nothing
spectacular
the
beer
pours
a
lovely
burnished
copper
with
a
tight
sand
colored
head
of
dense
bubbles
which
slowly
thins
down
leaving
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
spicy
hops
and
hints
of
biscuit
the
malt
and
hops
are
well
balanced
with
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
a
relatively
soft
hop
finish
medium
body
with
tiny
pinpricks
of
carbonation
but
not
too
much
the
malt
provides
plenty
of
smoothness
highly
enjoyable
first
of
all
i
love
their
illustrated
labels
they
really
set
the
mood
this
came
in
a
sampler
pack
this
poured
a
nice
ligth
amber
wa
great
frothy
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
aroma
contains
soem
caramel
flavors
and
showcases
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
it
is
nutty
earthy
and
fruity
all
in
one
pretty
good
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
clean
and
drinkable
brew
by
otter
creek
pours
a
dark
amberlight
copperish
color
with
small
white
head
smells
malty
with
a
tad
of
fruit
also
but
not
much
else
taste
has
a
fruitiness
to
it
but
the
malts
are
definately
noticeable
also
its
a
smooth
tasting
beer
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
not
too
much
though
this
beer
is
good
to
pretty
good
in
the
drinkable
category
with
an
average
mouthfeel
but
i
think
otter
creek
has
better
ales
overall
not
bad
but
pretty
average
for
an
altbier
i
love
the
style
so
much
and
this
one
is
just
a
little
too
simple
and
a
little
thin
pours
a
fairly
dark
copper
color
imagine
that
the
aroma
is
subtle
the
malts
dominate
but
there
are
some
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
is
a
bit
different
as
the
hops
and
malt
share
equal
strengths
and
interplay
fairly
nicely
the
hops
seem
the
focus
in
the
beginning
and
the
malts
assert
themselves
later
it
seems
very
clean
with
not
many
off
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
its
not
inoffensive
in
any
way
so
makes
a
good
session
beer
cheers
excellent
mix
of
caramel
malt
and
hops
with
a
rich
meaty
aftertaste
like
a
good
smoke
beer
cant
say
ive
ever
tasted
something
like
thisa
really
full
bodied
apa
almost
only
better
than
most
apas
drinkability
is
actually
not
bad
it
is
still
miles
above
any
macrobrew
even
with
all
of
the
less
than
desirable
features
that
i
mentioned
i
bought
a
sixer
to
check
this
brewery
out
for
the
first
time
and
i
find
that
they
go
down
pretty
easily
one
you
adjust
to
the
metallic
coppery
flavor
and
aftertaste
i
will
probably
try
another
one
of
their
brews
given
the
chance
but
will
not
opt
for
this
particular
product
again
an
ok
beer
nice
beer
here
though
perhaps
a
bit
too
zesty
for
my
liking
always
found
in
the
mixed
12
packs
its
certainly
worth
drinking
its
just
not
my
favorite
from
otter
creek
very
nice
beer
poured
on
41305
date
clearly
identified
if
only
all
breweries
could
be
so
bold
smokey
after
taste
by
far
its
strongest
characteristic
poured
deep
amber
with
reflect
of
gold
somewhere
in
there
a
very
nice
beer
this
being
the
first
offering
from
this
brewery
i
will
definatley
try
some
of
their
other
products
poured
a
clear
medium
copper
color
with
whitish
head
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
with
a
nice
nuttiness
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
a
little
hops
in
the
background
a
nice
toasty
crispness
at
the
finish
a
good
easy
to
drink
session
beer
thanks
to
fellow
ba
mtanji
for
the
sample
this
ale
was
very
drinkable
and
i
would
not
hesitate
to
stock
this
one
in
my
personal
stash
for
future
use
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
light
amber
with
a
1
figer
head
and
very
good
lace
slight
caramel
malt
notes
with
some
tart
apple
and
some
slight
hop
presence
some
hop
flavor
is
what
first
hits
not
too
much
though
followed
by
a
fruity
malt
presence
some
slight
raisin
and
apple
flavors
leaves
a
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
tounge
slightly
high
carbonation
and
good
drinkability
a
good
session
beer
tapped
at
eli
cannons
in
middletown
ct
this
week
yelloworange
copper
nearly
clear
no
discernable
head
but
left
a
ring
down
the
glass
smelled
of
overly
aggressive
hops
on
the
nose
which
confused
me
not
bad
but
not
particularly
inviting
either
decent
malt
and
some
candied
apple
taste
with
moderate
hops
to
keep
it
normal
nothing
that
left
film
or
aftertaste
so
it
was
pleasant
ok
carbonation
and
drinkability
the
combination
of
malty
flavor
and
carbonation
makes
my
mouth
happy
this
is
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
i
could
probably
have
pint
after
pint
of
wish
i
could
find
this
down
south
i
think
a
lot
of
people
that
dont
appreciate
good
beer
could
easily
get
into
this
one
pours
into
stange
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
copper
color
with
lively
bubbles
rushing
to
the
top
aroma
is
intriguing
and
tells
you
this
is
not
your
ordinary
ale
mostly
a
very
dry
bready
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
fruity
background
very
unique
this
is
my
first
altbier
so
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
but
this
is
definately
a
mellow
ale
and
you
can
tell
it
was
lagered
for
a
while
alot
of
the
fruity
ale
esters
have
subsided
into
the
background
and
it
lets
the
malt
profile
take
center
stage
the
malt
profile
is
very
dry
and
has
flavors
of
hay
whole
grain
oats
and
a
slight
presence
of
lemon
the
finish
is
herbal
and
lightly
bitter
saaz
hops
i
suppose
those
germans
love
em
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
with
alot
of
carbonation
and
a
bitter
dry
finish
the
drinkability
is
descent
but
its
so
different
from
what
i
normally
drink
its
not
really
a
session
beer
otter
creek
delivers
an
authentic
dusseldorferstyle
alt
biere
brewed
in
the
good
ol
us
of
a
its
clear
dark
copper
body
is
capped
by
a
short
head
of
white
foam
that
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
nice
walls
of
spotty
and
splotchy
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
lightly
fruity
and
peppered
with
leafy
and
spicy
noble
hops
amidst
a
delicate
toasty
malt
base
its
finebubbled
restrained
carbonation
leaves
it
slipperysmooth
across
the
palate
with
just
a
gentle
caress
on
the
tongue
the
fruitiness
is
less
apparent
in
the
flavor
than
the
aroma
but
its
still
there
and
it
works
exceptionally
well
to
brigthen
the
maltiness
and
offset
the
grassyspicyleafyfloral
hop
flavors
and
its
precision
tuned
bitterness
is
solid
enough
to
balance
it
perfectly
very
well
done
taste
is
bready
and
dry
although
there
is
a
pleasant
creamy
quality
as
well
with
dark
caramel
flavors
minus
the
sweetness
bitterness
is
relatively
high
though
well
incorporated
again
a
very
clean
easy
drinking
beer
like
other
copper
ales
ive
consumed
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
rough
because
of
the
carbonation
so
while
it
tastes
and
smells
great
it
doesnt
make
me
want
to
immediately
have
another
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
smallish
white
cap
that
laces
all
the
way
aroma
is
nutty
with
some
fruity
notes
no
real
hop
aromas
taste
starts
malty
and
ends
malty
barely
perceiveable
hop
just
enough
to
keep
this
in
line
nice
nutty
flavour
with
out
being
over
the
top
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
overall
not
exciting
enough
to
merit
ohhs
and
ahhs
but
overall
a
very
serviceable
ale
that
i
would
definitly
drink
again
nothing
spectacular
but
a
very
decent
drinkable
ale
my
brother
went
to
middlebury
college
and
i
can
remember
hating
this
beer
when
id
go
visit
him
as
an
undergraduate
myself
ten
or
so
years
ago
at
that
time
anything
darker
or
more
flavorful
than
natural
light
was
too
dark
and
bitter
for
me
now
i
pick
this
up
once
in
a
while
glad
they
distribute
as
far
south
as
richmond
as
a
reminder
of
what
i
was
missing
seems
to
me
this
may
have
been
watereddumbed
down
a
bit
over
the
years
still
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
it
as
it
reminds
me
of
good
times
in
middlebury
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
not
the
right
balance
for
my
taste
i
finished
the
sample
and
had
no
inclination
to
have
another
at
the
time
but
something
i
will
probably
go
back
to
here
and
there
12
oz
bottled
on
11005
batch
1670
the
pour
shows
that
it
is
indeed
copper
and
it
delivers
a
1
inch
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
smell
is
grassymetallic
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
fruit
and
floral
hops
taste
is
very
bitter
considering
its
only
21
ibus
flavors
are
roasted
with
coffee
earth
pineyfloralspicy
hops
and
metallic
tones
with
the
exception
of
the
roasted
flavors
the
hops
dominate
i
was
kinda
expecting
more
complexity
from
the
malts
even
though
this
is
my
first
altbier
however
the
label
says
they
use
6
different
malts
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
and
tingly
and
the
metallic
smell
and
taste
was
a
little
distracting
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
great
51805
got
another
sixer
and
im
not
noticing
any
of
the
characteristics
i
mentioned
above
it
tastes
like
metal
like
real
copper
gross
beer
is
served
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
clear
copper
color
with
small
off
white
surface
layer
of
head
aroma
is
mild
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
and
a
hint
of
earth
and
grassy
hop
character
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
and
average
carbonation
flavor
is
fairly
mild
and
similar
to
the
nose
with
caramel
and
a
bitey
grassy
hop
profile
mixing
nicely
the
finish
is
slighty
bitter
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
very
smooth
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
just
rather
blandaverage
in
my
mind
a
pretty
drinkable
alt
with
good
balance
and
flavor
not
a
great
beer
but
a
good
version
of
the
style
however
as
this
pint
was
consumed
the
flavour
did
improve
to
the
end
but
not
enough
i
loved
otter
creek
cascade
pale
ale
but
the
other
two
offerings
havent
exactly
floated
my
boat
this
one
just
tastes
odd
to
me
although
its
drinkable
id
still
like
to
sample
the
entire
line
from
these
guys
but
ive
had
enough
copper
ale
to
last
me
a
lifetime
a
highly
drinkable
beer
with
muted
flavor
that
wont
offend
may
be
a
good
crossover
beer
the
beer
poured
a
nice
copper
amber
in
color
also
there
was
very
little
head
which
became
a
thin
film
that
would
creat
the
slightest
of
laces
on
the
glass
the
beers
flavor
was
of
slightly
bitter
hops
followed
up
fairly
quickly
with
a
sour
citrus
taste
that
left
a
crisp
finish
the
aroma
was
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
however
the
mouthfeel
with
its
ever
so
slight
carbonation
helps
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
at
first
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
an
amber
ale
based
on
the
name
and
i
was
shocked
when
i
looked
at
it
and
tased
it
then
i
read
the
label
more
carefully
and
noted
that
this
is
a
northern
german
altbier
so
the
style
became
much
more
understandable
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wonder
why
they
didnt
name
it
something
else
that
would
be
less
confusing
to
the
beer
consumer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
tall
head
that
dies
off
slowly
and
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
nice
caramel
malt
smell
followed
up
by
some
hops
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
smooth
taste
is
of
caramel
malts
grains
and
sweetness
finish
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
nice
caramel
character
nice
beer
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
copper
color
hence
the
name
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
good
head
retention
and
good
lacing
the
smell
is
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
you
get
a
sweet
malty
nose
at
first
with
bits
of
caramel
then
you
get
a
nice
little
hit
of
hops
the
taste
starts
nice
and
malty
little
bits
of
sweet
grain
and
brown
sugar
the
finish
is
crisp
and
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
yet
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
good
a
big
shout
out
to
kmpitz2
for
this
great
brew
there
are
better
ales
out
there
in
my
opinion
this
belongs
in
the
adjunct
lager
category
beer
pours
a
nice
transparent
reddish
coppery
color
with
a
two
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
quarter
inch
cap
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
a
light
sweet
buttered
toffee
to
a
very
light
caramel
there
is
a
little
hint
of
sweet
floralgrapefruit
hop
in
there
too
the
flavor
starts
off
sweet
malty
slightly
caramel
toasted
malts
but
finishes
with
the
hops
which
are
sweet
and
a
bit
spicey
i
like
it
but
its
nothing
great
theres
no
real
thickness
to
the
beer
and
there
is
a
nice
bubbly
carbonation
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
it
out
again
just
sort
of
there
drinkability
its
an
easy
drinker
but
i
wouldnt
seek
out
another
this
just
seems
like
a
run
of
the
mill
beer
brewed
in
the
german
style
pleasantly
drinkable
with
lots
of
germanic
character
due
to
the
malts
very
drinkable
and
pleasing
to
the
palate
great
balance
of
sweetness
and
flavor
solid
beer
a
staple
session
beer
the
head
was
larger
and
full
of
citrus
overtones
the
taste
was
great
hops
and
malty
goodness
citrus
and
honey
possibly
a
little
more
roasted
than
burnt
nuts
the
mix
was
flawless
both
flavors
had
just
enough
play
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
good
altbier
diebels
on
tap
being
an
old
favorite
check
out
otter
creek
copper
ale
for
a
solid
session
brew
a
perfect
beer
for
almost
any
occation
with
a
smoothness
you
cant
get
with
most
beers
and
a
comfort
level
that
brings
drinkability
to
a
perfect
5
definitely
worth
a
couple
of
brews
not
outstanding
but
not
bad
either
had
a
few
while
skiing
in
vermont
have
started
seeing
the
handles
in
a
few
baltimore
bars
top
label
says
3
different
hops
and
6
different
malts
are
used
to
make
this
beer
yes
its
complex
alright
poured
out
a
medium
copperbrown
color
with
a
nice
enough
amount
of
carbonation
smell
was
malty
but
had
some
hops
in
there
some
caramel
was
in
there
as
well
with
a
touch
of
butterscotch
taste
was
complex
but
really
good
hops
make
an
appearance
first
with
some
slight
hint
of
fruit
and
caramel
then
blends
in
with
all
those
malts
finishes
slightly
sweet
and
a
little
dry
which
is
nice
for
this
brew
i
really
like
this
beer
and
should
get
a
little
more
respect
ontap
this
would
rock
overall
not
good
but
not
bad
a
definite
have
i
ever
drank
this
before
beer
its
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
lets
see
this
is
called

would

54not
much
in
the
way
of
appearance
the
unbalanced
hops
bite
through
this
imbalance
may
lead
to
its
great
dryness
there
is
a
mildy
light
body
that
borders
on

is
held
too
long
the
big
strike
of
this
beer
is
its
after
taste
that
is
long
and
uncomfortable
drink
this
one
with
some
food
and
it
will
be
a
better
experience
like
the
others
say
and
a
taut
balance
of
malts
and
hops
a
familiar
flavor
that
i
cant

could
drink
this
all

the

of

would

after
the
beer
is
finished
the
display
of
rings
along
the
glass
is
very
impressive
and
since
this
is
a
style
i
dont
have
often
so
i
will
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
and
deem
this
a
pretty
tasty
altbier
it
reminded
me
of
october
drinking
outside
and
made
the
german
in
me
proud
this
is
a
great
beer
its
a
touch
more
bitter
than
most
alts
but
thats
part
of
the
appeal
i
would
gladly
purchase
this
again
well
worth
a
try
once
again
with
unintentionally
aged
beers
a
light
hand
is
probably
best
following
the
popping
of
the
cap
the
bartenders
trick
netted
me
a
finger
of
dense

head
with
reasonable

i
dont

im
a
fan
of
the

lingering
bitterness
on

of
toasted

this
is
definitely
worth
trying
the

is
quite
nice
as
its
kind
of
like
a

its
true
to
the
style
except
for
the
hops
which
feel
a
little
out

a

this

around

starts
with
an
initial
fleeting
hint
of

that
quickly
fades
replaced
by

with
hints
of

the
treatment
of
the
bitterness
in
this
beer
is
outstanding
it
is
assertive
present
from
start
to
finish
but
so
well
balanced
by
the
malt
this
is
fresher
than
anything
you
will
get
imported
from
germany
the
imported
stuff
is
often
a
year
or
more
old
and
the
hops
are
muted
and
some
of
the
rich
malt
and
grain
flavors
are
hidden
behind
wet
cardboard
oxidation
flavors
here
the
hops
are
in
full
bloom
and
a
joy
in
perfect
balance
with
the
malt
this
take
on
an
altbier
is
simple
add
a
lot
of
hops
though
it
is
tasty
i
prefer
my
altbier
very
malty
the
taste
is
very
good
with
nice
malt
flavors
and
mild
yeast
with
balance
of
spice
and
noble
type
hop
flavor
with
mild
caramel
in
the
malt
and
light
nutty
woody
taste
from
the
hops
with
yeast
support
overall
a
very
nice
alt
i
consider
this
balanced
and
drinkable
oanother
beer
from
the
mix
pack
that
seemed
very
average
othis
may
compliment
a
pork
dish
but
on
its
own
its
barely
worth
the
time
okay
for
the
style
but
just
not
enough
there
to
enjoy
on
its
own
if
you
still
have
one
start
it
before
a
meal
and
see
if
the
meal
compliments
it
i
wouldnt
buy
this
if
offered
o
very
enjoyable
to
drink
o
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
makes
a
good
dinner
beer
but
not
tasty
enough
to
be
much
of
a
sipper
amber
in
color
w
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
tastes
of
grainy
malts
w
a
tinge

at

end
very
balanced
tasty
brew
i
am
not
a
master
of
altbier
but
this
seems
to
follow
the
styles
general
guidelines
with
added
hops
and
more
fruit
probably
not
aged
that
extendedly
another
solid
offering
from
the
beer
camp
series
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
being
my
first
exposure
to
the
style
i
have
little
to
compare
to
but
will
probably
seek
out
other
examples
based
on
this
offering
complex
enough
to
hold
my
interest
wish
it
was
sold

from
the

at

medium
bodied
with
plus
carbonation
overall
i
found
this
very
nice
though
im
not
super
familiar
with
the
style
so
dont
have
much
to
say
about
adhering
to
what
it
should
taste
like
i
like
this
one
a
lot
very
good
alt
with
a
nice
aroma
and
body
not
quite
special
but
good
enough
to
grab
one
before
they
are
all
gone
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
sweetness
in
the
beginning
then
mild
hop
and
bitter
crispness
the
beer
pours
a
decent
tannish
fluffy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
clearish
brown
the
beer
smell
has
a
nice
fruity
and
toffee
character
to
it
the
beer
also
has
slight
hop
notes
to
it
but
are
dominated
by
the
other
notes
the
beer
taste
is
similar
but
the
hop
notes
are
much
stronger
and
mix
well
with
the
toffee
and
fruity
notes
slight
bready
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
little
thick
with
some
cushiony
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
altbier
and
worth
getting
certainly
one
of
the
better
collaborations
damn
good
alt
nice
job
by
two
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
beer
has
a
very
pleasant
malt
bill
and
sweetness
with
a
well
proportioned
level
of
hop
bitterness
for
the
style
not
a
bit
altbier
fan
but
this
one
made
me
go
out
and
buy
a
few
other
brands
just
to
try
them
so
far
none
have
tasted
as
good
as
this
one
which
i
think
was
due
to
the
slightly
higher
hop
flavor
compared
to
the
few
i
bought
after
the
fact
overall
i
love
a
good
altbier
though
it
is
a
style
i
rarely
get
a
chance
to
taste
while
this
one
is
not
traditional
due
to
the
hop
bill
not
sure
what
was
used
here
but
it
really
worked
well
from
my
perspective

brew
in
that
it

this
isnt
bad
i
kind
of
like
this
one
light
crisp
to
start
smoother
at
the
finish
long
lasting
aftertaste
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
cool
spring
or
fall
day
overall
a
nice
beer
overall
solid
beer
overall
i
took
off
a
few
points
for
not
conforming
to
style
its
definitely
a
bit
hoppy
for
an
altbier
but
thats
okay
for
this
hophead
its
definitely
worth
trying
o
another
just
ok
style
from
the
sn
beer
camp
box
taste
has
more
nutty
maltiness
a
firm
hop
bitterness
and
a
yeasty
note
well
carbonated
and
with
a
relatively
substantial
body
for
an
alt
dry
aftertaste
overall
one
of
the
more
successful
beers
in
the

this
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
thought
victory
would
absolutely
nail
an
altbier
but
this
kind
of
hot
and
too
hoppy
it
is
a
good
beer
o
not
really
sure
ive
had
an
altbier
before
i
see
double
bag
on
the
other
beer
style
examples
list
but
i
dont
remember
it
being
similar
at
all
i
also
see
a
few
oktoberfest
beers
i
wish
more
were
more
like
this
two
of
my
favorite
breweries
giving
me
a
new
style
to
try
out
and
explore
is
a
plus
i
need
to
check
out
more
in
this
range
because
i
really
liked
this
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
cant
really
complain
about
it
but
not
one
of
the
best
of
the

poured
a
gorgeous
clear
deep
copper
colored
body
with
three
fingers
of
fluffy
offwhite

that
slowly
receded
leaving
minimal

a
nice
looking
altbier
that
is
fairly
true

bready

in

as

it

thus

only
5
brews
in
leaves
up
to
the
expectations
from
a
collaboration
between
two
superb
breweries
cheers
overall
this
beer
achieves
what
it
set
out
to
be
a
citrusy
altbier
with
plenty
of
care
going
into
it
id
down
a
few
mugs
of
these
if
i
had
the
opportunity
the
two
that
came
in
the
mix
case
will
do
for
now
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
ruby
red
nice
full
ecru
colored
head
that
refuses
to
die
down
great
fruity
scent
smells
of
grapes
pear
and
a
hint
of
maple
very
smooth
mouthfeel
malt
forward
tasting
but
less
fruity
than
the
nose
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
beer
very
clean
finish
very
well
done
altbier
i
cant
really
recall
and
altbiers
ive
had
but
would
like
to
try
and
find
some
to
compare
this
one
its
fairly
different
and
id
try
it
again
kind
of
refreshing
o
a
great
take
on
an
oftneglected
german
brew
would
be
great
with
pizza
or
bbq
o
very
enjoyable
brew
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
dopplebock
ill
look
forward
to
another
one
of
these
overall
kind
of
bland
grainy
nutty
malts
with
an
odd
bitter
finish
one
of
the
better
collaborations
in
this
pack
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
an
alt
good
toasty
malt
notes
with
a
nice
taste
of
chocolate
a
beautiful
caramel
nose
with
zesty
spicy
hops
i
get
notes
of
coffee
and
bitter
cocoa
the
taste
is
balanced
nicely
between
those
very
hops
and
dark
caramel
malts
high
bitterness
actually
kind
of
striking
as
it
lingers
long
after
each
swallow
good
medium
body
there
but
not
heavy
with
solid
carbonation
overall
id
like
to
see
more
of
this
style
and
i
really
enjoy
the
hop
presence
and
malt
balance
however
the
bitterness
lingers
on
and
on
detracting
from
the
overall
experience
o
a
solid
take
on
the
style
nice
and
robust
while
remaining
easy
to
drink
definitely
one
of
the
maltiest

overall
i
love
the
way
the
citrus

and

come
in
to
give
the
grain
centerpiece
a
kick
i
dont
think
id
call
this
a
traditional
alt
but
its
close
enough
to
not
have
lost
sight
of
the
original
style
and
their
interpretation
is
really
tasty
id
have
to
say
that
this
one
is
the
surprise
beer
of
the
pack
for
me
its
not
my
favorite
but
it
really
exceeded
my
expectations
based
on
what
ive
heardread
about
this
one
from
others

the

more

towards
the
end
malty
finish
floral
hop
aftertaste
with
more
caramel
malts
light
body
with
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
pretty
decent
altbier
and
better
than
i
expected
overall
a
well
crafted
beer
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
a
great
example
of
the
style
imo
o
well
they
certainly
took
some
liberties
with
the
style
but
that
was
clearly
their
intention
this
is
much
bigger
and
bolder
than
any
alt
ive
ever
had
the
flavors
at
work
dont
really
mesh
well
though
i
think
victory
makes
some
damn
good
beers
but
i
was
not
expecting
much
from
this
one
this
is
the
first
altbeer
that
i
have
ever
had
that
i
am
aware
of
it
was
more
hoppy
than
i
initially
thought
it
would
be
its
a
solid
beer
and
well
balanced
not
a
big
surprise
from
victory
it
is
described
as
an
old
style
beer
with
a
new
take
on
it
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
of
the
lot
but
nothing
spectacular
either
it
looked
good
had
good
head
retention
and
overall
a
solid
beer
experience
i
would
drink
more
of
these
for
sure
if
they
were
around
7
a
six
pack
a
well
done
altbier
easy
drinking
with
a
well
balanced
hop
and
malt
character
prost
i
never
have
had
too
many
styles
of
this
beer
before
but
i
still
enjoy
it
it
has
a
strong
malt
profile
i
get
flavors
of
toasted
grain
bread
and
sweet
malts
that
all
lead
into
a
slight
citrusy
hop
flavor
to
finish
it
out
it
is
sturdy
and
warming
but
still
quite
refreshing
overall
a
rather
good
alt
a
nice
level
of
roast
that
complements
the
sweet
rather
nicely
and
leaves
one
with
just
enough
bitter
from
the
hop
to
cleanse
the
palate
a
bit
o
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
overall
but
the
fairly
strong
lingering
bitterness
is
a
bit
odd
and
holds
the
beer
back
as
a
whole
o
nice
style
sufficiently
interesting
o
the
altbier
is
not
a
very
popular
style
it
seems
but
i
have
had
some
really
nice
ones
over
the
past
couple
years
this
one
is
a
little
more
average
to
me
not
a
big
fan
of
anise
and
missing
some
of
the
lighter
fruity
notes
that
i
find
pleasant
in
the
style
o
this
is
good
would
seek
this
one
out
a
nice
relaxing
beer
that
has
the
flavor
and
enough
depth
to
keep
it
interesting
yet
light
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
evening
more
hoppy
than
most
in
this
style
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
works
well
this
is
a
damn
good
altbier
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
pick
up
a
6
pack
of
this
to
quench
my
thirst
on
a
nice
warm
day
or
to
sit
back
with
at
the
end
of
the
day
an
interesting
but
not
very
drinkable
concoction
though
lovely
to
look
at
from
the
12
oz
bottle
that
is
part
of
the
2014
beer
camp
dozen
aroma
is
fitting
for
the
style
with
some
bready
caramel
and
notes
of
german
malts
and
a
light
kiss
of
hops
which
expands
with
warming
taste
follows
with
light
caramel
notes
and
some
bready
toasted
vienna
malt
character
offers
a
fairly
long
finish
of
malt
depth
not
overly
sweet
and
with
some
muddled
hops
in
the
mix
a
soft
mouthfeel
for
the
style
is
welcome
and
makes
for
a
very
quaffable
altbier
not
a
style
im
overly
fond
of
but
a
good
example
for
my
palate
o
tastes
like
an
alt
but
its
nothing
spectacular
this
is
one
of
the
more
disappointing
beer
camp
collaborations
in
my
opinion
o
the
taste
of
this
beer
has
a
very
good
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
is
very
true
to
the
style
crisp
clean
and
quite
refreshing
its
minerally
finish
concludes
the
mediumdry
body
that
begins
the
show
its
light
husky
astringency
reminds
the
senses
of
rye
but
is
softer
and
gentler
on
the
palate
and
taste
even
as
its
bitterness
intensifies
with
each
sip
o
a
nice
drinking
beer
of
a
sort
ive
never
had
before
similar
in
some
ways
to
other
brown
ales
ive
had
mellow
roasty
and
hearty
as
far
as
i
can
tell
essentially
a
german
brown
ale
if
this
particular
ale
isnt
a
good
representative
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
know
but
as
compared
to
american
browns
and
ipas
and
all
the
other
stuff
ive
had
id
say
its
a
good
beer
o
fairly
hoppy
for
an
altbier
but
still
enjoyable
not
quite
the
sweetness
that
i
expected
from
the
style
and
i
have
been
to
düsseldorf
and
enjoyed
the
majority
of
altbiers
available
there
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
making
it
easy
to
drink
taste
is
definitely
heavy
on
the
toasted
malts
with
a
bitter
hop
bite
that
cuts
thru
the
palate
pretty
quickly
though
this
one
with
its
toasty
almost
roasty
character
reminds
me
somehow
of
an
extrahopped
brown
ale
almost
regardless
of
comparisons
this
remains
a
tasty
and
unique
take
on
the
alt
bier
tradition
nice
character
here
kind
of
tangy
which
i
can
deal
with
mild
nutty
thing
going
on
very
smooth
feel
though
somewhat
thick
easy
enough
drinker
somewhat
hearty
though
not
overly
so
enough
that
it
makes
it
too
much
the
verdict
good
beer
victory
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
i
cant
find
them
as
readily
out
here
on
the
left
coast
i
was
hoping
for
something
to
knock
my
socks
off
from
them
but
i
dont
think
theres
a
lot
of
room
for
experimentation
in
an
altbier
quality
brew
but
nothing
unique
or
earthshattering
overall
really
simple
a
little
boringmild
tasting
but
still
tastes
and
good
and
enjoyable
nothing
special
and
a
little
weak
but
still
worth
a
drink
o
as
befitting
a
collab
between
sn
and
victory
this
is
a
beer
that
seems
to
conform
to
the
traditional
style
but
with
an
american
twist
here
the
pine
flavours
are
fairly
dominant
on
the
finish
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
just
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
this
is
hard
to
judge
as
i
have
not
had
any
altbiers
brewed
outside
of
dortmund
but
this
is
what
i
imagine
an
american
take
on
the
style
to
be
i
would
prefer
less
of
the
signature
pine
bitterness
though
o
another
decent
beer
camp
beer
of
a
more
obscure
style
still
has
that
sn
taste
to
it
though
pours
out
a
black
tea
body
with
a
thinnish
head
smells
lightly
malty
and
a
bit
grainy
honestly
im
not
picking
up
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
flavor
is
a
bit
deeper
i
get
some
dried
fruit
caramel
malts
toasty
malts
a
touch
of
grain
and
clean
yeast
mouthfeel
has
a
really
soft
carbonation
smooth
body
this
is
ok
kind
of
like
a
lot
of
us
made
altbiers
they
just
dont
cut
it
for
me
and
lack
that
great
german
maltiness
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
old
world
versions
overall
interesting
altbiers
are
def
a
different
style
that
most
breweries
are
not
sure
how
to
do
and
i
have
a
tough
time
judging
them
this
is
decent
big
hop
and
malt
balance
big
on
both
sides
but
balanced
bit
too
big
on
spicy
piney
hops
though
overall
not
a
truly
traditional
alt
but
like
the
hop
flavor
on
the
palate
that
washes
nicely
with
it
interesting
compliment
and
something
different
for
once
in
this
style
hop
aroma
no
flavor
on
the
palate
delivering
fun

with

overall
a
pretty
good
altbier
i
have
to
say
nice
malt
profile
and
just
enough
bitterness
o
a
slightly
hoppy
but
definitely
recommended
version
of
the
style
overall
this
is
another
solid
beer
in
the
beer

series
like
others
its
not

or

blowing

solid
gotta
be
upper
40s

ibus
here
seems
a

not

for

for
the
beer
underneath
it
very
enjoyable

if
i
could

the

any

the
mark
was
not
high
on
this
one
surprised
because
victory
was
the
tag
team
partner
here
goes
to
show
that
much
more
often
than
not
when
it
comes
to
brewing
beer
one
head
is
better
than
two
overall
very
inviting
malt
forward
malt
aroma
bitterness
is
prominent
but
pleasing
in
the
flavor
well
made
beer
i
would
drink
many
more
i
will
seek
it
out
on
tap
overall
im
impressed
with
the
beer
and
the
loads
of
earthy
hops
and
balance
it
executes
overall
the
taste
is
absolutely
correct
although
by
pushing
up
the
abv
and
ibus
this
might
be
a
little
overdone
no
complaints
however
my
first
altbier
maybe
my
last
the
malt
bill
leaves
me
kind
of
unimpressed
and
the
lack
of
any
other
prominent
flavor
makes
for
a
boring
beer
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
a
very
good
alt
loses
a
few
points
for
the
noticeable
yet
not
overwhelming
booze
on
the
finish
would
like
it
to
have
just
a
slightly
more
rounded
mouthfeel
with
that
said
this
is
well
crafted
love
how
they
got
some
marked
fruit
presence
in
this
one
i
dig
it
o
another
great
beer
from
the
beer
camp
12pack

of

sweet
subtle

the

surprisingly
quick
very
nice
brew
im
on

alt
route
this
is
an
altbier
labeled
to
be
anchored
by
a
layered
slightly
sweet

body
supported
by
citrusy
hop
flavor
and
aroma
it
delivers
on
that
promise
fairly
well
but
lacks
in
the

department
the
hops
have
taken
over
and
while
id
usually
shout
oh
hell
yeah
the
balance
is
off

all
in

this
beer
is
diverse

thats

flavor
is
definitely
more
spiced
than
the
aroma
my
criticism
would
be
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
brown
sugar
in
the
flavor
to
smooth
it
out
a
bit
still
some
spicy
hop
becoming
more
present
as
it
warms
caramel
and
mild
cookie

flavors
at

along
with

the

imo
o
this
is
probably
my
favorite
offering
from

to
date
everything
fits
just
right
with
this
one
atmosphere
is
good
dark
amber

a
really
nice
foamy

and
lots
of

is
a
very
full
nutty
baked

combination
with
lots
o

flavor
is
bitter
rye
bread
and
fresh

leaves
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
overall
the
taste
lets
me
down
just
enough
to
qualify
this
as
a
regular
drinker
its
certainly
a
matter
of
opinion
and
this
altbier
is
certainly
worth
a
try
all
in
all
decent
a
little
too
heavy
for
my
liking
and
i
think
the
bitterness
comes
across
a
little
harsh
this
is
chewy
yet
not
sweet
so
the
bitterness
cuts
right
through
lively
easy
drinking
thinner
bodied
brew
maybe
a
tad
watery
but
comparable
to
the
others
ive
had
in
the
style
i
continue
to
be
suprised
by
the
brews
from
this
brewery
they
are
simple
yet
have
some
great
aspects
that
help
them
shine
this
brew
was
excellent
only
improvement
would
be
the
aroma
which
neededs
just
a
bit
more
to
help
close
it
out
everything
else
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
for
the
warmer
months
the
taste
was
somewhat
faint
as
well
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
like
fruity
hops
but
very
light
in
flavour
it
was
high
in
carbonation
and
light
in
body
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
this
style
of
beer
to
be
anyway
i
did
not
really
enjoy
it
as
a
result
its
a
beer
with
a
nice
balance
and
easy
enough
to
drink
dr
a
decent
beer
i
would
not
object
to
another
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
my
first
foray
into
the
altbier
style
and
if
the
rest
can
measure
up
to
this
guy
ill
be
back
for
more
overall
this
was
a
basic
altbier
it
had
all
the
notes
that
i
was
expecting
as
usual
it
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
freshness
that
is
characteristic
to
all
shiner
offerings
o
a
very
well
balanced
brew
hop
malt
bill
make
for
a
good
session
brew
overall
impression
my
second
favorite
from
shiner
spoetzel
so
far
great
has
a
nice
clean
and
easy
drinking
taste
but
then
has
a
good
amount
of
character
to
it
roastiness
and
caramel
flavors
come
out
big
time
at
the
finish
of
each
drink
recommend
this
one
too
o
overall
a
well
balanced
brew
sweet
malt
and
hops
come
out
pretty
even
and
make
for
a
pretty
complex
beer
with
a
low
abv
so
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
not
a
bad
session
beer
to
bad
it
only
comes
as
a
single
in
the
shiner
family
pack
first
review
great
alt
beer
from
shiner
cheers
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
to
be
honest
its
not
a
favorite
style
for
me
and
i
think
i
actually
preferred
512s
alt
over
this
one
i
got
a
fingerandahalf
of
rocky
lighttan
head
with
good
retention
from
my
pour
color
was
a
deepcopper
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
was
very
biscuit
malty
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
mouthfeel
was
very
full
creamy
and
smooth
the
initial
taste
was
of
fresh
bread
followed
by
a
molasses
tartness
and
then
a
gentle
grassy
hoppiness
this
was
as
pleasant
a
drink
as
i
have
had
in
a
while
and
i
could
easily
see
why
they
would
take
pride
in
it
finish
was
semidry
with
an
emphasis
on
the
biscuit
malt
interacting
with
the
grassy
hops
more
please
overall
this
is
a
bit
mild
as
expected
but
even
more
bland
than
i
expected
i
drank
it
down
pass
next
much
better
around
to
offer
esepcially
in
this
category
spend
the
extra
few
bucks
for
some
quality
overall
impression
i
found
this
be
be
very
drinkable
even
in
this
summer
heat
however
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
a
whole
lot
more
in
the
fall
as
i
really
enjoyed
the
bready
and
caramel
malt
flavors
this
one
only
comes
a
single
beer
at
a
time
in
the
shiner
mixed
six
pack
so
put
this
one
in
the
fridge
and
save
it
for
a
nice
october
evening
ono
matter
what
the
score
reveals
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
quite
different
and
enjoyable
im
sure
there
are
better
alts
out
there
but
this
is
a
fair
example
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
rather
weak
flavor
profile
and
a
little
thin
nothing
really
stands
out
here
this
might
qualify
as
a
slightly
hoppy
british
style
but
im
not
buying
the
alt
and
im
not
sold
on
it
on
the
whole
not
bad
but
not
good
either
a
nice
brew
i
like
the
beer
but
not
the
best
alt
and
not
the
best
by
spoetzl
toasty
wet
grain
is
bold
and
lends
a
burnt
quality
to
it
somewhat
like
a
cross
between
an
anchor
steam
beer
and
a
bock
earthy
and
some
sulfurous
lager
flavors
as
it
warms
i
am
not
sure
i
would
want
to
drink
alot
of
this
but
it
was
a
fun
brew
to
drink
and
makes
you
think
a
bit
lots
of
subtle
complexities
here
o
this
was
the
first
beer
i
have
had
from
shiner
where
i
took
a
sip
shifted
eyes
took
another
sip
put
the
beer
down
and
simply
said
there
it
is
a
great
beer
its
a
solid
offering
and
a
solid
beer
coming
out
of
a
brewery
that
produces
a
lot
of
fairly
mainstream
products
theyve
been
trying
to
produce
some
more
interesting
and
flavorful
beers
recently
and
this
one
certainly
fits
the
bill
prosit
i
hope
this
becomes
a
regular
offering
from
shiner
i
would
buy
this
all
the
time
nice
to
finally
see
something
from
shiner
on
the
shelf
thats
not
the
bock
this
pours
a
copper

plenty
of

might
be

in

but
the
warm
toastiness
makes
up
for
it
clear
reddishorange
with
a
decent
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
bit
then
left
some
nice

and
a
thin

layer
as
it
dissipated
bit
of
toffee
on
the
nose
along
with
a
faint

aroma
more
of
the
same
on
the
palate
this
beer
has
pretty
distinct
front
mid
and
finish
with
nice
hop
bitterness
bringing
up
the
rear
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
creamy
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
a
beer
that
goes
down
easy
but
has
enough
going
on
to
keep
you
interested
even
after
having
a
couple
also
this
is
the
first
alt
i
have
had
in
a
really
long
time
and
right
now
i
am
wondering
why
that
is
rjt
o
very
good
altbier
that
is
accessible
to
all
will
be
coming
back
even
though
alt
is
not
my
favorite
style
picked
this
one
up
in
a
mixer
sixer
from
shiner
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
clear
medium
golden
color
which
looks
similar
to
apple
juice
and
an
offwhite
soapy
head
the
nose
is
a
mix
of
fruity
malt
and
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
similar
with
sweet
fruity
maltiness
intertwined
with
a
citrusy
hop
presence
there
is
also
an
off
putting
bitter
buttery
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
creamy
inactive
carbonation
overall
not
really
impressive
or
remarkable
wont
be
searching
this
out
in
the
future
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
this
is
a
nice
alt
overall
shiner
has
done
a
good
job
with
this
one
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
head
smells
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
orchard
fruits
a
light
yeastiness
and
even
a
touch
of
banana
the
taste
is
also
quite
fruity
but
there
is
some
graininess
to
balance
and
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
as
well
more
of
that
banana
in
the
finish
this
is
actually
fairly
tasty
it
doesnt
have
the
bite
that
you
usually
find
in
an
alt
and
it
isnt
quite
as
dry
either
but
its
still
relatively
crisp
and
the
fruitiness
is
quite
pleasant
i
enjoyed
it
from
the
mixed
six
and
its
a
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
ok
o
smell
and
appearance
are
very
good
but
the
bitterness
and
carbonation
are
over
done
overall
the
best
brew
in
the
shiner
mixed
6
pack
thoroughly
enjoyable
too
bad
they
dont
make
it
available
on
its
own
o
again
this
isnt
a
complex
beer
but
its
a
good
selection
straightforward
malt
and
hop
combo
drinkability
is
refreshing
with
some
nice
but
simple
character
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
wouldnt
get
sick
of
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
if
available
d
hard
for
me
to
drink
the
herbal
tastesmell
is
almost
medicinal
and
i
felt
it
was
overcarbed
too
despite
being
very
thin
and
low
abv
i
didnt
find
it
particularly
drinkable
overallfirst
beer
out
of
the
mixed
6
and
impressed
very
nice
beer
that
is
sessionable
and
highly
drinkable
do
drinkability
is
pretty
easy
and
its
a
decent
altbier
its
worry
a
revisit
while
its
around
but
i
likely
wont
nicely
balanced
and
very
easydrinking
and
refreshing
one
of
shiners
better
offerings
it
has
a
kind
of
dark
malty
taste
not
much
hops
in
either
the
taste
or
nose
i
suppose
its
right
for
the
style
but
the
style
has
never
been
one
of
my
favorites
i
will
try
to
avoid
this
isnt
a
horrible
beer
but
my
first
batch
homebrewed
alt
i
made
back
in
94
was
as
good
as
or
better
than
this
this
is
a
light
hearted
attempt
at
the
style
at
best
overall
a
bit
mild
as
expected
but
pretty
decent
i
drank
it
down
no
really
i
did
o
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
quality
of
this
brew
was
only
disappointed
in
the
lack
of

it
would
make
a
great

for
the
summer

challenging
here

a
great

never

and

it
is
nothing
that
really
excites

me
to

more

is
seriously
lacking
though
id
have
no
problem
drinking
some
more
if
given
to
me
but
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
d
very
nicely
balanced
ale
from
shiner
light
and
easy
drinker
although
it
has
its
own
taste
you
can
still
tell
that
this
is
a
shiner
product
i
would
love
to
see
this
as
a
six
pack
for
the
summertime
drinkability
a
solid
beer
overall
and
worth
a
try
though
not
spectacular
id
have
this
again
but
i
cant
say
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
im
not
familiar
with
this
style
beer
so
i
have
no
idea
if
alt
biers
typically
are
this
sweet
all
i
know
is
that
this
beer
is
not
really
for
me
i
mean
it
was
good
enough
for
one
but
im
not
going
to
be
rushing
out
to
by
another
pours

with

smells
slightly
metallic
with
a
sweetness
presented
by
the
malt
tastes
more
complex
than
the
other
spoetzl

perceived
it
as
a
brilliant
upfront
hoppy
kick
with
sweetness
settling
in
afterwardkind
of
opposite
of
most
beers
overall
quite
a
delicious
beer
overall
but
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
backbone
and
more
hops
to
really
fill
it
out
another
new
beer
from
shiner
that
is
decent
but
nothing
really
worth
seeking
out
still
it
is
a
lot
better
than
a
lot
of
the
other
yearround
beers
made
by

lace
color
is
a
lovely
garnet
amber
aroma
was
weird
skunk
and
funk
flavor
was
totally
different
more
bitter
than
sweet
earthy
like
the
commercial
description
body
is
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
carbonation

is

rather
long
12
ounce
bottle
one
of
the
6
beers
in
shiners
family
reunion
6pack
served
in
a
stangealtbier
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
an
inch
and
a
half
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
mostly
toasted
malt
along
with
some
caramel
and
hops
the
aroma
is
nice
but
its
also
weak
the
brew
tastes
just
like
the
aroma
but
stronger
its
mostly
toasted
malt
but
also
some
caramel
and
hops
are
noticable
theres
a
nice
lingering
bitter
grassy

finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
little
bit
slick
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
it
sure
goes
down
easy
enough
i
thought
this
brew
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
liked
it
d
quite
drinkable
this
isnt
the
best
alt
out
there
but
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
style
the
aroma
is
a
bit
subdued
with
little
to
enjoy
but
the
flavor
is
very
nice
with
lots
of
toast
and
some
caramel
to
keep
things
interesting
as
i
stated
earlier
a
unique
hybrid
nice
to
see
a
holidaythemed
brew
doing
something
besides
adding
spices
this
beer
may
not
truly
understand
what
it
actually
is
beyond
fairly
delicious
decent
beer
not
my
style
great
looking
beer
glowing
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
a
decent
winter
seasonal
but
much
stronger
and
hoppier
than
a
real
alt
considering
the
seasonal
competition
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
though
pours
a
deep
dark
nutbrown
with
a
thin
lacy
head
tasted
just
plain
awesome
with
thick
sweet
notes
of
molasses
and
malt
with
a
refreshing
evergreen
hop
bite
went
down
smooth
and
easy
despite
the
abv
i
didnt
get
to
try
a
whole
lot
of
it
for
myself
but
im
glad
i
didnt
give
it
all
away
overall
this
is
a
nice
seasonal
unfortunately
i
did
not
see
that
this
comes
in
a
sixer
format
will
definitely
pick
up
a
sixer
for
next
year
to
me
this
drinks
more
like
a
strong
ale
than
an
alt
really
enjoyable
and
the
malty
sweetness
and
slight
hoppiness
paired
very
well
with
the
halibut
i
had
it
with
ive
gotten
out
of
the
habit
of
buying
ninkasi
but
this
was
leftover
from
a
six
pack
that
my
son
in
law
had
bought
so
im
glad
he
left
it
id
definitely
buy
this
once
in
a
while
during
the
winter
season
this
seasonal
release
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
its
nose
was
a
slight
nuttiness
with
a
hint
of
molasses
strong
coffee
flavour
with
some
caramel
in
the
mouth
as
well
as
some
hoppiness
that
wasnt
very
prevalent
on
the
nose
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
competent
quite
bitter
yet
well
balanced
not
as
rich
a
mouthfeel
as
id
expect
from
the
look
and
taste
would
like
more
malt
here
a
strange
and
very
american
retelling
of
an
old
european
story
yknow
boozing
and
hopping
up
an
altbier
not
to
mention
trying
to
pass
it
off
as
a
holiday
seasonal
well
they
seem
to
have
succeeded
on
all
fronts
as
despite
this
ones
weird
astringency
it
still
goes
down
well
in
the
face
of
snowfalls
and
stupidly
overcrowded
shopping
expeditions
alike
oh
and
i
suppose
i
can
let
some
bloodline
roll
in
honour
of
punny
names
everywhere
t
high
malt
character
some
dark
fruit
flavors
and
perfume
from
hops
kola
nut
flavor
really
reminds
me
of
christmas
but
just
because
of
those
cocacola
cans
still
this
beer
works
psychologically
probably
not
as
good
as
the
rating
suggests
earthy
flavors
and
very
nutlike
finish
slight
metallics
really
linger
in
the
aftertaste
malty
and
earthy
from
what
im
guessing
is
noble
hops
not
my
normal
style
of
beer
i
would
choose
but
i
got
it
because
i
was
going
to
a
slayer
concert
it
was
a
hit
with
all
the
people
going
i
think
it
was
more
on
the
novelty
of
it
but
it
was
a
fun
beer
to
try
pours
a
lovely
brown
with
ruby
tint
to
it
a
head
of
tan
foam
that
fell
fast
nose
is
a
pleasant
malt
that
smells
dry
and
deep
it
has
the
beginings
of
what
might
have
been
dark
fruit
but
it
was
forbidden
so
tempting
with
its
sweetness
and
rich
scents
perfect
clarity
form
this
beer
it
glows
softly
from
within
to
sport
those
garnet
hues
like
a
hidden
gem
deep
within
the
beer
malt
is
rich
and
extends
beyond
the
beers
time
on
the
palate
it
seems
to
go
on
forever
it
has
a
dry
crispness
in
and
of
itself
it
has
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
caramel
is
laid
under
the
dry
malt
its
as
though
the
heartier
aspects
wanted
to
be
up
front
and
so
they
stayed
there
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
it
is
appropriately
thin
on
the
palate
it
is
not
weighted
down
or
heavy
even
though
the
malt
is
substantial
it
finishes
dry
and
with
that
bitterness
that
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
it
makes
you
smile
the
richness
has
abated
for
a
moment
like
its
toying
with
you
this
is
a
lovely
altbier
and
i
think
its
one
of
the
best
american
alts
i
have
had
its
clean
and
crisp
relatively
bitter
poured
a
clear
deep
brown
body
with
reddish
tint
when
held
to
light
and
a
one
finger
bubbly
offwhite

a
very
nice
looking
true
to
form
altbier
scents
of
rich
sweet
malt
light
fruity
esters
reminiscent
of
apple
and
grape
and
a
medium
level
of
noble
hop
perfume
floral
and
spicy
especially
pepper
aromas
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
classic
very
well
executed
dusseldorf
altbier
that
hits
the
style
exactly
extremely
well
done
flavor
begins
moderately
bitter
with
a
floral
and
perfumelike
noble
hop
presence
evident
a
light
fruitiness
that
matches
the
aroma
and
a
mediumlight
level
of
sweet
malt
this
moves
into
a
middle
with
the
same
noble
hop
character
but
adds
a
more
pronounced
and
complex
malt
flavor
that
is
sweet
and
slightly
bready
in
character
fruity
ester
flavors
are
still
present
still
light
and
still

a

a
clean

aftertaste
is
moderately
bitter
with
a

presence
of
sweet
bready
grainy
and
biscuity
malt
flavors
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
nicely
done
dusseldorf
altbier
that
trends
towards
the
bitter
end
of
the
style
yet
fits
it
quite
nicely
well
executed
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
impression

is
of
an
excellent
and
true
to
form
dusseldorf
altbier
overall
this
is
a
good
altbier
it
is
very
true
to
style
and
pleasant
in
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
it
is
a
nicely
done
aromatic
flavorful
ale
and
quite
nice
overall
this
is
tasty
and
worth
checking
out
quite
dark
and
slightly
reddish
hue
with
tan
head
taste
is
toasted
malts
pretty
bitter
but
smooth
overall
very
malty
and
grainy
with
a
lower
level
of
sweetness
not
a
bad
altbier
but
not
the
easiest
drinking
either
a
nice
one
to
try
and
good
if
you
are
not
feeling
anything
sweet
overall
its
a
really
good
beer
and
shouldnt
necessarily
be
a
winter
beer
as
this
would
be
good
year
round
with
that
dry
bitter
finish
really
happy
a
friend
from
just
north
of
the
washingtonoregon
state
line
sent
me
this
o
a
decent
beer
and
not
what
i
expected
would
like
to
for
it
to
have
had
a
little
more
flavor
and
aroma
it
was
a
little
dissappointing
still
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
o
aside
from
boosting
my
egoism
and
having
a
name
that
made
me
want
to
enjoy
this
with
hells
angels
in
a
pool
room
this
was
very
subtle
everything
is
balanced
just
wished
it
was
brought
out
more
with
a
name
like
sleigh
this
is
not
a
beefed
up
beer
of
this
style
over
all
i
have
to
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
likes
darker
sessionable
beers
its
almost
in
the
realm
of
a
stout
or
porter
but
not
quite
there
o
overall
nice
winter
beer
hits
the
vibe
of
the
season
just
right
enjoyable
brew
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
quite
similar
to
many
winter
warmers
alcohol
level
is
on
the
high
side
but
is
mostly
hidden
by
all
the
rich
flavors
recommended
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
a
beer
that
bared
the
name
of
the
almighty
thrash
lords
known
as
slayer
it
did
not
let
me
down
i
need
to
blast
some
altar
of
sacrifice
while
i
enjoy
this
id
recommend
this
beer
to
any
metal
or
hop
head
defiantly
a
beer
worthy
of
slayers
name
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
glad
ninkasi
is
holding
it
down
for
us
folks
here
in
oregon
i
was
drinking
some
of
this
around
the
holidays
and
thought
it
bit
hoppy
for
my
taste
oftentimes
i
think
many
craft
beers
particularly
those
brewed
on
the
west
coast
suffer
from
too
much
of
a
good
thing
hops
the
hops
in
this
beer
seem
a
tad
bit
toned
down
after
the
interim
of
about
4
months
and
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
a
bit
more
than
at
christmastime
now
that
its
come
down
a
bit
in
price
im
liable
to
get
another
bomber
or
two
before
its
gone
slightly
chalky
palate
with
a
well
balanced
bitter
finish
would
buy
again
overall
a
decent
session
beer
its
10
below
right
now
but
i
still
cant
quite
call
this
something
for
winter
with
such
a
mild
taste
i
bought
it
because
i
love
the
slayer
homage
on
the
label
but
thought
it
was
average
at
best
i
definitely
prefer
this
beer
on
the
warmer
side
although
it
is
still
good
coldchilled
deep
dark
brown
with
reddish
hues
substantial
off
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
fluffy
cloud
like
lacing
aromas
of
fruity
malt
dough
and
alcohol
mild
sweetness
up
front
with
a
bittersweet
finish
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
alcohol
flavor
definately
comes
through
as
well
slight
roasted
chocolate
and
cola
notes
nice
smooth
and
creamy
body
with
medium
carbonation
it
has
a
good
feel
and
is
drinkable
but
there
are
some
strange
flavor
notes
here
that
im
not
that
crazy
about
id
have
again
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
note
to
reader
i
had
a
raspberry
candy
before
imbibing
and
after
review
of
other
reviews
this
may
have
had
an
affect
on
my
perception
of
this
beer
this
may
be
too
malty
for
me
and
not
yeasty
enough
which
is
what
i
enjoy
most
in
dubbel
styled
beers
but
it
isnt
bad
at
all
especially
when
consumed
chilled
warmed
up
is
a
different
story
altogether
but
ill
probably
have
another
for
the
holidays
worth
a
try
as
its
quite
experimental
in
some
ways
delicious
and
a
great
take
on
combining
a
holiday
ale
and
alt
styles
overall
this
is
a
solid
winter
seasonal
though
im
a
bit
perplexed
at
labeling
this
a
double
alt
when
ive
had
standard
alts
with
just
as
much
flavor
and
abv
still
im
enjoying
the
brew
and
may
be
a
future
purchase
o
not
a
fan
to
be
honest
its
an
okay
beer
and
i
wouldnt
recommmend
or
have
again
but
still
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
altbier
in
general
o
very
malt
forward
and
not
really
any
hop
presence
which
is
rare
for
a
ninkasi
beer
even
their
oatmeal
stout
is
pretty
bitter
hop
bomb
o
i
love
it
tastes
hoppier
than
i
would
expect
from
a
dark
double
atlbier
though
ive
never
had
an
ale
described
exactly
like
that
before
this
but
less
bitter
than
the
ibu
rating
had
me
bracing
for
this
hoppiness
works
brilliantly
for
such
a
sweet
beer
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
although
i
think
it
could
have
been
better
im
a
sucker
to
chocolate
and
cherry
in
the
beer
and
it
worked
here
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
have
liked
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
herbal
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
am
liking
the
smell
over
the
taste
medium
dark
brown
when
poured
with
very
little
foam
but
a
fair
amount
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
caramel
fruit
and
spices
was
sort
of
weak
but
after
a
few
more
sniffs
you
could
pick
it
up
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
bittersweet
dark
caramel
and
a
hint
of
dark
bitter
chocolate
on
the
palate
the
7
2
alcohol
wasnt
that
much
a
factor
the
bitter
flavorless
taste
linger
just
to
much
overall
it
could
have
been
a
touch
softer
m
light
to
medium
body
light
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
nicely
balanced
double
altbier
nice
malty
backbone
with
some
dark
fruit
chocolate
and
yeast
character
to
balance
o
good
stuff
at
this
age
the
alcohol
seems
to
be
stronger
and
the
hops
a
little
less
might
have
let
it
sit
a
little
too
long
but
it
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
review
from
112010
notes
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
light
head
and
lacing
aroma
of
fruit
bread
and
malt
medium
body
malty
flavor
with
a
peppery
bite
in
the
middle
roasty
and
dark
malt
light
fruit
a
bit
of
nut
some
cocoa
mild
hops
dry
spicy
finish
a
nice
revisitable
seasonal
ale
this
really
grew
on
me
as
i
finished
the
glass
the
appearance
turned
out
to
be
eh
not
bad
the
lacing
was
there
but
it
wasnt
that
pretty
it
was
somewhat
patchy
and
extremely
soapy
and
bubbly
it
didnt
look
like
your
average
lacing
at
all
rather
worse
than
average
im
not
quite
sure
how
to
grade
this
because
the
head
was
nice
the
body
wasnt
really
amazing
but
better
than
average
i
supposed
for
sure
unique
regardless
the
lacing
wasnt
bad
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
im
going
to
give
it
a
3
5
for
appearance
i
could
give
it
a
4
but
i
wouldnt
say
ive
cut
this
beer
any
breaks
but
there
have
been
a
few
grades
that
i
gave
a
4
to
instead
of
a
3
5
already
overall
solid
and
smooth
a
nice
winter
brew
and
mild
given
the
biggish
abv
if
your
looking
for
a
maltcentric
beer
to
cuddle
up
to
while
waiting
for
santa
this
may
be
a
good
stocking
stuffer
while
the
aroma
doesnt
lead
you
to
expect
much
this
packs
a
singular
malty
punch
without
excessive
astringency
the
specialty
malts
are
well
displayed
but
in
no
way
overwhelm
the
base
malts
d3
5
so
so
not
too
complex
it
has
a
sweet
smell
almost
flowery
and
has
no
head
at
all
very
weak
no
foam
at
the
top
smalls
like
nail
polish
very
alcholic
heavy
mouth
feel
but
can
seem
moderate
aond
some
what
watery
has
a
very
sour
taste
with
a
bitter
finish
it
lingers
little
but
not
to
much
when
you
swollow
i
didnt
like
it
myself
but
it
i
liked
beer
i
might
overall
tasty
malty
beverage
from
ninkasi
not
their
best
not
their
worst
overall
this
is
a
good
winter
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
and
drink
it
again
a
good
christmas
beer
but
some
more
sweetness
on
the
palate
would
go
a
long
way
to
balance
it
out
nothing
too
special
but
an
enjoyable
beer
good
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
has
a
wintertime
feel
but
neither
too
sweet
nor
too
strong
not
bad
all
up
but
a
little
average
the
problem
is
that
its
not
that
interesting
and
its
not
even
that
classically
altbier
solid
enough
on
its
own
terms
but
ninkasi
can
do
better
a
drinkable
brown
ale
in
an
unusual
style
i
doubt
ill
see
this
after
the
holidays
but
ti
was
fine
while
it
was
here
on
the
brewerys
website
it
mentions
this
has
an
ibu
of
50
so
i
was
a
bit
confused
because
the
draft
form
of
this
i
had
was
a
chocolate
malt
bomb
that
had
bitter
chocolate
flavor
and
no
hop
bitterness
however
it
was
not
a
bitterness
i
would
rate
at
50
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
as
the
label
indicates
it
formed
a
white
head
which
indicated
that
this
was
not
as
dense
or
containing
as
much
roasty
tones
of
a
stout
but
was
going
to
be
an
interesting
experience
when
i
smelled
it
it
really
did
not
have
much
of
a
scent
due
to
it
just
being
taken
out
of
the
fridge
but
there
was
a
bit
of
that
dark
malt
scent
after
the
first
taste
you
get
that
maltiness
up
front
and
through
the
rest
of
the
sip
there
are
no
hops
but
was
a
bit
disappointed
that
the
chocolatey
malts
i
got
on
draft
was
not
in
the
bottle
it
was
kind
of
subtle
so
this
is
totally
a
draft
beer
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
was
the
way
you
would
want
it
overall
i
gave
this
a
4
because
its
a
solid
beer
but
get
it
on
draft
its
a
much
more
pleasant
experience
im
not
really
sure
what
a
dark
double
alt
is
but
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
its
a
unique
one
and
its
tastynot
your
typical
holiday
ale
d
nice
alt
for
how
big
this
beer
is
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
a
bit
sweet
but
it
is
nicely
balanced
o
has
too
many
big
minuses
for
me
to
give
it
a
great
grade
smell
is
weak
taste
is
weak
and
mouthfeel
is
weird
that
being
said
i
might
actually
buy
this
again
something
about
it
strikes
me
maybe
it
is
the
7
2
percent
abv
o
its
decent
nothing
special
at
all
nothing
bad
again
ive
yet
to
have
anything
negative
to
say
about
anything
from
ninkasi
brewing
check
this
one
out
or
anything
else
they
offer
great
stuff
o
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
almost
reminds
me
of
some
chinook
hopped
beers
but
i
could
be
wrong
good
if
you
like
malty
beers
and
some
aftertaste
not
too
hoppy
not
sure
of
this
thing
though
it
kinda
confuses
me
but
good
beer
im
not
an
alt
expert
but
this
one
is
clearly
more
northwest
winter
warmer
or
even
american
red
than
an
authentic
german
altbier
seems
to
me
anyway
and
thats
just
fine
because
its
the
quality
that
counts
and
this
one
delivers
a
double
dark
alt
turns
out
to
be
a
winter
warmer
by
any
other
name
but
this
is
one
for
the
maltier
side
you
can
taste
the
hops
but
the
big
strong
malt
comes
through
in
the
finish
quite
drinkable
and
most
likely
a
canidate
for
one
year
in
the
cellar
i
thought
this
one
the
money
and
tsting
close
to
full
sails
wassail
o
really
enjoyable
after
warming
a
bit
itll
be
nice
to
work
through
the
sixpack
during
these
dark
evenings
pretty
good
all
around
not
to
sweet
or
spicy
the
abv
seems
reasonable
too
im
not
sure
about
the
style
but
whatever
o
liking
this
beer
a
lot
definitely
on
the
malty
side
but
has
a
nice
slight
spice
and
long
bitterness
i
like
the
warm
balance
it
creates
with
the
alcohol
went
great
with
my
lamb
sausage
sweet
beer
smoky
lamb
o
pretty
drinkable
for
7
2
abv
overall
a
tasty
beer
the
extra
hops
was
a
mistake
though
it
covers
up
flavors
and
gives
this
an
astringent
edge
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
a
pretty
straightforward
take
with
some
nice
simple
flavors
and
aromas
but
its
done
well
and
works
well
taste
is
quite
malty
as
to
be
expected
with
the
style
theres
a
nice
earthy
and
slightly
sharp
flavor
that
rounds
it
is
out
well
it
doesnt
seem
syrupy
or
overly
sweet
but
its
making
my
lips
sticky
d
drinks
extremely
easy
and
smooth
pours
a
moderate
caramelbrown
color
really
really
murky
without
any
real
head
formation
or
lacing
afterward
the
nose
brings
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
plus
a
bit
of
bready
easta
nd
some
light
toast
flavor
is
mostly
just
a
touch
of
caramel
with
some
very
light
hopping
and
then
some
bread
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
booze
not
bad
but
not
something
id
look
for
again
great
beer
has
got
to
be
the
1
reason
to
live
in
the
northwest
ninkasi
is
producing
some
remarkable
contributions
to
the
craft
beer
legend
here
the
dark
couble
alt
sleighr
is
a
worthy
offering
beautiful
mahogany
color
nice
enduring
lacing
malty
without
tasting
like
my
moms
drop
bisquits
smoth
mouthfeel
and
perfect
carbonation
makes
my
day
a
wonderfully
colored
beer
dark
brown
body
thats
nearly
black
but
a
beautiful
shade
of
crimson
glows
as
light
filters
through
the
edges
a
bold
aroma
of
crystal
malt
and
that
distinct
laggery
alt
smell
taste
is
the
moderately
sweet
alt
flavor
we
expect
and
well
balanced
with
an
amped
up
dose
of
hops
the
beers
only
downside
is
that
the
hop
flavor
is
a
little
onedimensional
leaving
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
lacks
some
character
still
a
flavorful
beer
with
voluptuous
texture
great
winter
drinking
when
one
needs
a
break
from
the
typical
winter
stouts
and
ales
palate
is
sweet
and
malty
nutty
and
slightly
chocolatey
some
mild
fruity
hops
keep
it
from
being
an
overwhelming
malt
blast
and
leave
a
pleasant
bitterness
on
the
finish
body
is
full
and
a
bit
creamy
a
very
nice
vehicle
for
the
assertive
flavors
im
not
sure
ive
had
more
than
a
couple
of
beers
in
the
doublealt
style
but
ive
sure
been
enjoying
this
one
all
winter
long
a
nice
break
from
the
usual
ninkasi
hop
bombs
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
a
flavor
bomb
by
any
means
there
are
definitely
better
winter
seasonals
out
there
a
little
bitter
but
overall
a
well
made
beer
thats
easy
to
appreciate
would
love
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
stuff
d
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
another
solid
brew
sent
my
way
thanks
again
bro
another
winner
from
ninkasi
and
a
nice
way
to
treat
yourself
on
a
cold
grey
winter
night
drinkability
not
a
bad
drink
there
isnt
too
much
to
it
its
kind
of
a
let
down
for
how
dark
and
strong
of
a
beer
this
is
but
the
alcohol
and
flavors
mix
well
for
a
beer
that
is
both
as
strong
and
as
dark
as
this
i
am
finding
it
surprisingly
bland
cause
this
ones
for
us
taste
is
a
lot
of
toasted
barley
singed
almost
burnt
caramelised
dry
leaves
and
wood
black
pepper
a
burntpepper
bitterness
just
dominates
dark
toffee
sweetness
at
finish
but
backs
off
before
becoming
too
bitter
bitterness
lingers
with
some
hints
of
sweet
dark
dried
fruits
and
a
light
winey
element
bitterness
is
just
a
touch
too
assertive
at
end
but
it
has
good
character
and
flavour
feel
is
good
solid
not
heavy
finally
had
a
chance
to
open
my
growler
of
sleighr
which
had
apparently
done
30
days
in
bourbon
casks
before
i
had
gotten
it
very
very
nice
it
had
been
in
the
growler
aging
for
about
a
month
on
a
road
trip
to
albuquerque
waiting
for
the
right
moment
to
open
tonight
in
rainy
oregon
it
poured
with
a
lovely
brown
head
with
the
aroma
of
bourbon
great
mouth
feel
lots
of
maltiness
from
the
bourbon
and
simple
hopping
and
generous
use
of
munich
and
vienna
malts
a
true
double
alt
id
missed
the
regular
sleighr
last
year
but
still
remember
the
2008
the
added
aging
in
whisky
casks
made
this
a
truly
wonderful
surprise
a
bit
better
than
my
keg
of
the
great
2010
light
in
the
mouth
but
fitting
for
the
style
a
nice
dark
take
on
the
alt
style
d
nice
balance
warming
but
not
harsh
and
overall
pretty
tasty
very
well
suited
for
the
winter
months
d
its
ok
very
inexpensive
for
the
bomber
3
50
which
helps
just
wish
there
was
something
more
to
it
not
a
bad
beer
enjoyable
some
alcohol
present
have
a
had
few
from
this
brewery
ill
reserve
judgement
till
i
have
a
few
more
what
ive
so
far
ive
liked
ok
nice
beer
not
what
i
expected
but
very
good
albeit
not
real
comlex
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
on
this
one
smokey
with
coffee
tones
with
food
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
no
freshness
info
this
bottle
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
a
month
or
so
and
i
am
just
now
getting
to
it
pours
a
lovely
light
brown
color
with
an
inch
of
lumpy
foam
good
lacing
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
with
slight
roasted
notes
and
an
herbal
bitter
quality
hints
of
dark
chocolate
fairly
full
bodied
with
a
nice
round
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
good
drinkability
for
7
2abv
the
nutty
taste
of
the
roasted
malt
prevails
all
the
way
through
to
the
finish
the
bitterness
that
comes
from
the
hops
doesnt
really
complement
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
i
dont
think
the
style
needs
this
much
hop
bitterness
they
stayed
true
to
the
style
but
i
feel
like
they
upped
the
hops
along
with
the
alcohol
and
the
result
is
too
bitter
not
bad
though
something
different
but
nothing
great
this
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
for
someone
for
example
the
one
raving
about
it
sitting
next
to
me
just
not
for
me
appearance
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
thick
off
white
head
having
good
lace
smell
has
a
light
roasted
malt
aroma
taste
of
lightly
roasted
malts
having
a
good
balance
with
the
hops
ending
in
a
light
piney
note
mouthfeel
is
a
heavy
medium
with
good
carbonation
not
a
big
or
complex
as
expected
but
still
a
simple
easy
drinking
alt
ale
im
not
sure
how
to
feel
about
this
beer
initially
this
is
my
first
experience
with
an
alt
which
i
bravely
will
be
brewing
in
the
next
few
weeks
with
a
beer
this
dark
i
usually
expect
it
to
deliver
a
little
more
sweetness
it
smells
delightful
to
be
sure
but
taste
is
simply
roasty
if
that
is
your
bag
then
this
beer
will
be
awesome
i
think
it
would
be
much
improved
if
it
had
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
it
then
again
that
may
well
just
be
the
style
good
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
and
dry
finish
good
drinkability
as
well
mouthfeel
about
a
35
thickness
but
not
coating
feels
a
lot
like
a
root
beer
i
really
like
this
brew
i
would
buy
it
again
and
again
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
light
for
a
winter
ale
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
good
feel
to
it
but
i
just
cant
get
behind
the
dry
biscuity
malt
flavors
they
just
dont
turn
my
key
still
a
decently
crafted
brew
pours
a
nice
crisp
herbal
offbrown
cream
white
head
interesting
balance
between
malt
and
hops
it
leans
towards
the
sweeter
side
this
is
a
very
malty
dark
herbed
beverage
i
feel
like
im
drinking
an
extremely
toned
down
shot
of
fernet
the
flavors
remind
me
of
winter
theres
definitely
a
nice
pine
malthop
bitterness
to
it
that
seems
to
be
the
main
theme
of
this
drink
notes
of
pine
and
annis
are
definitely
in
your
face
ive
had
a
cookie
that
resembles
the
flavor
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
is
easy
to
drink
the
herbal
notes
are
definitely
not
bad
but
i
think
after
one
of
these
bottles
im
good
for
a
week
or
two
this
is
my
third
bottle
in
two
months
it
definitely
makes
you
want
drink
it
again
just
not
in
a
hurry
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
unique
holiday
beers
pour
a
dark
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
smells
like
nutty
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
mint
the
taste
is
strong
on
chocolate
and
hops
it
seems
more
like
a
porter
than
an
altbier
the
nutty
smell
isnt
really
there
on
the
tongue
as
would
be
expected
from
an
altbier
while
it
also
has
strong
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
drinks
very
clean
and
crisp
the
sweet
chocolate
lingers
on
the
tongue
well
if
you
like
malty
winter
beers
this
is
for
you
it
is
a
wonderful
departure
from
the
typical
over
hopped
holiday
ales
its
simply
not
overdone
making
it
a
joy
to
have
and
have
and
have
although
i
usually
say
away
from
cold
winter
brews
i
find
this
one
enjoyable
served
at
a
typical
fridge
temp
buy
as
much
as
you
can
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
impressive
brew
it
doesnt
really
fit
the
name
nor
the
label
as
its
neither
heavy
metal
nor
holiday
spiced
but
its
one
impressively
delicious
brew
thats
definitely
worth
seeking
out
really
didnt
enjoy
this
one
just
not
my
kind
of
beer
cheers
smooth
drinkable
malty
but
a
bit
flat
in
flavor
basically
a
typical
brown
ale
in
a
nice
bottle
d
very
drinkable
and
tasty
d
i
just
killed
a
bomber
inside
of
an
hour
and
could
easily
get
started
on
another
one
if
i
had
one
verdict
you
can
find
this
beer
cheaper
under
a
different
name
but
all
old
school
heshers
have
to
drink
it
out
of
deference
overall
impression
perhaps
not
as
smooth
as
it
could
be
but
pretty
tasty
drinkability
is
quite
high
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
a
very
nice
lineup
from
ninkasi
as
mentioned
before
this
beer
is
a
nice
example
of
the

overall
impression
good
beer
but
nothing
that
will
knock
your
socks
off
better
seasonals
out
there
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
fairly
interesting
flavors
although
they
are
a
bit
subdued
as
is
proper
for
the
style
except
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
double
it
seems
very
similar
to
full
sails
wassail
but
i
didnt
taste
it
side
by
side
but
just
had
it
recently
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
whole
lot
to
look
forward
to
d
i
remembered
enjoying
it
last
year
but
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
i
usually
find
beers
similar
to
this
style
usually
are
a
bit
tougher
for
me
to
drink
through
though
i
found
this
beer
extremely
easily
drinkable
and
pleasant
a
very
nice
winter
seasonal
and
one
i
will
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
overall
a
nice
little
gem
in
the
winter
alealtbier
categories
and
with
a
rad
name
to
boot
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
balanced
beer
thats
on
the
darker
side
without
being
quite
as
bitterroasted
tasting
as
a
porter
or
stout
youll
enjoy

liked
the

on

drinkable
overall
a

beer
for
the
winter
this
is
a
delightful

beer
and
my
favorite
ninkasi
brew
to
date
reasonably
good
buy
at
3
59
per
bomber
still
thats
eqivalant
to
11
75
per
sixpack
which
seems
real
high
when
i
can
pick
up
jubelale
for
a
7
per
sixpack
all
winter
long
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
the
smooth
nose
continues
on
the
palate
where
each
component
of
roasted
malts
hops
and
alcohol
blend
harmoniously
creating
a
very
enjoyable
beer
especially
if
you
happen
to
sit
in
front
of
a
fireplace
during
a
cold
winter
night
it
is
delicate
yet
robust
in
its
composition
successfully
creating
an
alt
beer
which
has
gone
to
the
dark
side
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
winter
seasonal
since
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
but
is
not
filling

abv
is
masked
very
well
competitively
priced

at

but
would
be
better
if
available
in
sixers
of
12
oz

other
comments
the
abv
is
well
hidden
because
the
alcohol
warmth
is
pretty
understated
hitting
you
really
late
and
kind
of
deep
in
the
chest
a
nice
winter
seasonal
of
course
it
looks
like
a
winter
seasonal
we
drank
it
in
september
so
i
dunno
if
this
aged
and
mellowed
or
whatnot
because
that
split
bomber
is
my
only
insight
so
i
guess
at
the
very
least
i
can
say
this
beer
does
just
fine
aged
up
to
9
months
mouthfeel
is
not
too
thick
but
a
little
sticky
tasty
drinkable
beer
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
6
month
old
bottle
pours
a
diet
coke
caramel
brown
with
a
small
head
that
remains
for
awhile
smell
is

sugar
cookie
and
yeast
taste
is
mild
and
pleasant
most
of
the
hop
bitterness
present
fresh
has
disappeared
but
has
left
a
sweet
and
refreshing
drink
figs
fruitcake
apricot
brown
sugar
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
appropriate
for
the
style
pretty
dry
finish
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
a
pleasant
beer
ignore
the
letter
rating
d
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
some
nice
roasted
and
sweet
malts
but
nothing
really
jumpoed
out
about
it
to
me
would
give
another
shot
with
the
possible
exception
of
tricerahops
double
ipa
everything
that
ive
had
from
this
brewery
has
been
as
solid
as
granite
sleighr
is
a
pretty
cool
name
but
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
available
all
year
round
d
okay
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
drinkable
nonetheless
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
malty
brown
very
well
made
satisfying
but
dangerously
smooth
the
beer
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
with
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
caramel
malt
toffee
dark
fruits
and
grassy
hops
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
little
disappointing
overall
but
a
beer
worth
trying
great
tasty
warmer
that
goes
down
very
well
good
balance
with
a
nice
hop
rush
md
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
going
the
tastes
all
play
together
very
well
dark
brown

a
bit
of
chill

substantial
off
white

slow

an
impressive
looking
beer
the
nose
is
quite
malty
a
bit
more
sweet
than
bready
not
much
hop
presence
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
the
same
as
nose
with
a
slight
smokiness
and
some
caramel
malts
pretty
well
balanced
the
finish
is
a
bit
bitter
was
wondering
when
the
hops
would
appear
pretty
viscuous
mouthfeel
features
significant
carbonation
drinkable
yes
though
a
bit
boozy
for
the
stylemore
of
a
sipper
than
a

memorable
no
to
be
honest
the
second
best
christmas
beer
from
eugene
ive
had
this
year
after
oakshires
ill
tempered
gnome
overall
a
pretty
good
altbier
yum
overall
a
better
than
solid
beer
thats
worth
your
time
d
im
farther
down
this
beer
than
i
realized
between
when
i
started
this
review
and
now
its
really
delicious
pours
a
dark
amber
with
mildly
off
white
head
retention
is
medium
malt
forward
flavor
profile
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
bread
plus
mild
tobacco
notes
bitterness
is
medium
lingering
well
into
a
dry
finish
the
hop
character
is
very
subdued
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
but
is
apparent
though
balanced
throughout
a
good
drinker
but
not
session
material
at
7
2
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
and
as
stated
the
abv
goes
unnoticed
and
the
hops
make
it
refreshingly
crisp
very
well
done
ninkasi
this
is
a
solid
altbier
and
very
representative
of
the
style
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
uniqueness
for
a
winter
beer
but
cant
fault
it
for
style

this
is
a
great
alt
but
i
am
not
overly
impressed
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
nor
does
it
have
anything
unique
to
offer
spices
etc
d
easily
drinkable
i
got
this
one
on
draft
at
the
belmont
station
and
they
served
it
at
the
correct
temp
allowing
the
flavors
to
really
challenge
the
palate
wonderful
beer
medium
to
medium
low
carbonation
medium
full
body
balance
to
the
malt
the
body
itself
almost
full
but
sticking
to
a
solid
medium
range
is
pretty
rich
its
dry
all
the
way
from
middle
to
finish
after
starting
off
semidry
and
all
the
more
as
a
feel
like
burnt
woods
and
an
ashy
feel
mingle
on
the
palate
didnt
have
many
expectations
for
this
one
as
im
not
the
biggest
arbor
fan
out
there
and
i
am
also
not
very
well
versed
in
altbiers
needless
to
say
i
ended
up
thinking
this
was
pretty
decent
and
its
definitely
something
i
would
recommend
trying
at
least
once
kind
of
like
a
dry
stout
though
maybe
just
a
touch
lighter
in
malty
character
though
still
very
roastheavy
nothing
spectacular
but
certainly
not
bad
brewer
aims
for
the
sticke
altbier
and
seems
to
hit
that
right
with
the
more
robust
profile
expect
a
slightly
higher
abv
but
this
works
for
me
it
keeps
on
growing
on
me
sip
after
sip
overall
this
was
a
pretty
dull
beer
that
i
wasnt
impressed
with
i
liked
the
look
and
aroma
of
this
beer
but
after
that
everything
pretty
much
went
down
hill
there
wasnt
much
going
on
in
the
flavor
darpartment
and
what
was
there
was
pretty
subdued
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
a
mess
it
was
too
watery
and
way
over
carbonated
i
wasnt
digging
this
brew
and
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
buy
it
again
i
have
very
little
experience
with
this
style
with
this
being
first
altbier
i
have
knowingly
drank
but
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
people
its
just
too
out
of
whack
and
needs
lots
of
work
i
am
starting
to
think
arbor
brewings
beers
are
hit
or
miss
for
me
with
the
misses
being
the
majority
but
i
am
not
ready
to
write
them
off
just
yet
pours
a
dark
brown
hat
is
nearly
opaque
win
a
nice
off
white
head
some
lacing
nose
brings
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
that
consists
of
darker
chocolate
bringing
some
dryness
as
well
taste
and
feel
come
together
with
a
nice
dry
malt
characteristic
the
taste
is
a
bit
plain
wihout
much
more
than
some
grain
and
faint
flavors
behind
it
but
i
like
the
feel
drinks
well
and
shows
me
yet
again
why
i
wish
this
were
a
more
common
style
a
slightly
musty
aroma
of
hops
and
yeast
is
discernible
full
pour
produces
a
light
brown
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
flavor
is
hoppy
on
the
front
of
the
palate
with
not
much
follow
through
a
dark
brown
color
it
is
somewhat
thin
in
the
mouth
but
well
carbonated
more
hoppy
than
malty
an
unexceptional
but
very
drinkable
session
beer
drinkability
with
a
lighter
body
and
moderate
alcohol
content
a
2nd
order
is
in
my
immediate
future
d
pretty
easy
drinker
i
would
move
on
to
another
beer
at
a
bar
and
i
dont
think
ill
buy
this
one
again
drinkability
not
really
sure
i
dig
these
flavors
as
of
yet
the
bitterness
is
nice
but
a
little
too
present
and
doesnt
bring
enough
flavor
along
with
it
an
incredibly
massive
head
i
poured
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
and
its
literally
all
dense
tan
head
with
about
a
half
inch
of
beer
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
its
annoying
because
i
want
to
drink
it
i
can
still
smell
it
though
and
it
smells
like
smokey
burnt
raisins
and
burnt
carmel
tastes
as
it
smells
but
with
a
mediocre
sour
aftertaste
that
i
dont
really
care
for
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
upon
second
sniff
i
can
detect
the
sourness
in
the
aroma
also
i
just
lowered
the
ratings
from
3
to
2
in
both
those
categories
the
texture
is
a
little
watery
and
too
carbonated
im
disappointed
in
this
beer
but
what
do
you
expect
from
something
that
comes
from
ann
arbor
go
state
drinkability
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
i
have
at
the
brewpub
in
ypsi
d
impressive
appearance
and
nose
decent
taste
mouthfeel
needs
work
id
try
it
again
though
its
not
one
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
ive
ever
had
but
its
smooth
and
pleasant
if
it
was
sold
near
me
id
buy
it
again
if
this
had
been
called
a
porter
i
wouldnt
disagree
with
you
and
would
most
likely
score
it
higher
d
its
a
pretty
easy
drinker
the
flavors
were
complex
enough
that
i
might
give
it
another
shot
d
very
easy
to
drink
makes
me
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
than
one
since
i
wont
be
back
up
there
any
time
soon
very
nice
appearance
but
looks
can
be
deceiving
smell
is
faint
a
little
sweetness
and
maybe
a
hint
of
riesling
im
dumbfounded
at
the
lack
of
flavor
considering
the
appearance
and
smell
nothing
really
offensive
to
the
taste
but
quite
bland
very
little
maltiness
a
tiny
hint
of
fruit
sweetness
but
mostly
with
high
carbonation
i
could
almost
mistake
this
for
club
sodavery
watery
moderately
light
if
you
had
no
desire
for
flavor
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
im
afraid
id
die
of
boredom
first
starts
off
well
enough
with
some
dark
fruit
flavors
and
toasted
chocolates
but
theres
a
smoky
flavor
lingering
there
that
doesnt
do
it
to
me
its
more
ashtray
than
it
is
campfire
theres
not
much
to
balance
it
out
in
the
end
and
comes
up
feeling
flat
12

very

but
maybe
just
a
bit
overcarbonated
if
not
for
the
carbonation
i
would
say
this
is
extreamly
drinkable
but
as
such
is
just
good
drinkability
a
very
interesting
and
unique
alt
d
a
little
more
chocolate
and
roast
than
other
alts
i
have
had
but
i
like
it
thanks
to
theblackmallard
for
the
tip
on
this
one
notes
from
050606
then
again
maybe
its
just
a
bad
bottle
because
i
dont
remember
reacting
this
way
to
another
one
i
had
a
few
days
ago
albeit
with
a
largely
shot
palate
after
a
couple
of
dipas
this
is
a
dark
brown
alt
but
i
guess
it
doesnt
always
have
to
be
ambercolored
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
both
a
bit
disappointing
i
just
pulled
a
deep
caramel
sweetness
without
much
other
complexity
the
body
was
balanced
and
drinkable
but
the
flavor
wasnt
compelling
enough
to
try
this
again
my
first
altbier
poured
a
very
dark
chocolatey
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
a
pleasant
maltiness
with
perhaps
some
sort
of
slight
smokiness
or
chocolatey
the
flavor
is
a
great
combination
of
chocolate
and
malt
its
moderately
carbonated
and
mediumbodied
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
definitely
recommendand
i
would
now
also
like
to
try
it
on
tap
found
this
to
be
a
great
little
beer
for
a
summertime
cooler
was
a
little
surprised
how
cold
it
was
served
on
tap
at
several
different
locations
looks
great
in
the
glass
with
a
light
colored
head
resting
atop
a
very
dark
brown
beer
medium
carbonation
and
a
crisp
maltiness
and
not
very
hoppy
very
drinkable
with
a
modest
alcohol
content
d
interesting
and
pretty
damn
refreshing
could
use
a
little
more
chocolate
malt
to
offset
the
tart
tanginess
d
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
sit
and
drink
a
few
very
easy
going
down
d
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
but
i
do
not
see
this
being
a
session
beer
or
me
indulging
in
this
again
overall
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
jolly
pumpkins
bam
noire
but
not
as
good
overall
a
different
kind
of
beer
good
but
very
hard
to
place
dark
brown
pour
not
much
head
not
much
nose
but
deep
malt
that
is
what
this
style
is
mostly
about
eh
thanks
to
hophobo
for
providing
it
as
an
extra
not
much
depth
but
a
nice
solid
brew
not
sweet
no
hops
just
solid
malt
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
just
not
one
to
seek
out
unless
all
you
see
are
macros
around
probably
only
around
ann
arbordetroit
nice
but
move
on
i
picked
this
up
in
detroit
a
couple
weeks
ago
and
its
been
chilling
on
deck
for
about
a
week
i
poured
it
into
a
sam
adams
glass
and
it
filled
to
the
top
with
poofy
tan
foam
the
liquid
itself
was
very
dark
mush
darker
than
other
alts
ive
tried
the
aroma
was
off
in
my
opinion
a
little
fruity
and
a
little
acidysour
same
with
the
taste
it
had
some
offflavors
i
didnt
think
matched
the
beer
style
i
wont
try
it
again
d
i
could
drink
this
a
lot
a
very
nice
beer
the
balance
seems
off
on
this
one
the
sour
cherriness
upfront
is
just
too
much
pours
a
cloudy
copper
brown
quite
opaque
loose
tan
head
forms
big
bubbles
settles
to
a
thin
ring
and
layer
few
lace
spots
smell
is
neat
iron
caramel
roast
chocolate
bit
of
coffee
very
clean
aroma
maybe
too
clean
some
bread
dark
fruits
interesting
taste
is
kind
of
bland
and
watery
some
caramel
and
chocolate
bread
roast
coffee
not
much
else
but
a
bit
buttery
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
pretty
smooth
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavour
dies
thanks
lexx
d
ok
i
suppose
but
this
tastes
like
a
maltier
porter
which
is
singlulary
coffee
flavored
pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
excellent
light
tan
head
that
billows
and
floats
for
minutes
nose
is
mild
some
light
spiciness
and
sweet
malt
flavor
is
interesting
surprisingly
sour
this
is
my
first
alt
but
there
wasnt
anything
in
the
description
about
sourness
in
any
case
theres
a
fair
bit
of
roasted
molasses
light
astringency
some
light
fruit
fairly
well
balanced
in
terms
of
malt
and
hops
feel
is
alright
medium
body
maybe
a
little
light
on
the
carbonation
this
one
isnt
bad
although
its
the
first
alt
ive
had
so
i
dont
really
have
a
lot
to
compare
it
to
the
sourness
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
overall
its
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
or
slightly
bigger
smooth
and
low
on
carbonation
great
drinkability
for
the
amount
of
flavor
in
this
one
what
is
it
with
breweries
in
ann
arbor
frog
island
leopold
brothers
and
this
brewery
all
have
nasty
infected
products
dont
the
brewers
drink
what
they
sell
how
could
they
let
this
go
out
on
the
shelves
this
is
the
furthest
thing
from
an
alt
ive
ever
had
a
disaster
down
the
drain
it
goes
something
about
that
acidity
i
like
exceedingly
refreshing
for
an
otherwise
fudgey
flavored
light
ale
no
aroma
little
dots
in
the
head
some
bitterness
and
decent
for
the
style
but
not
the
best
i
have
had
a
tad
of
chocolate
malt
smokesaaz
like
carbonation
bit
lemon
and
acid
in
the
finish
and
on
aftertaste
quaffable
though
didnt

work
out
on

into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed

of
medium
brown
head
over
the
12
of
very
cloudy
dark
brown
brew
there
will
have
to
be
some
patience
involved
with
drinking
this
brew
huge
frothy
head
fades
way
slowly
i
went
away
and
came
back
later
left
monumental
amounts
of
lacing
aroma
is
nutty
medium
to
dark
malts
taste
is
also
medium
malts
upfront
with
an
increasing
amount
of
hops
as
time
passes
mouthfeel
is
still
a
bit
gassy
but
overall
not
bad
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
once
you
can
finally
drink
it
this
one
was
satisfying
is
some
areas
kind
of
lacking
in
others
but
has
some
nice
potential
this
arbor
beer
is
a
nice
session
brew
i
like
the
roasted
aspects
of
22
but
it
isnt
flawless
try
it
with
some
ribs
or
brisket

this

dependable
happy
hour
beer
for
me
at
the
a
b
c
not
the
most
bold
or
challenging
but
usually
pleasant
nonetheless
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
full
tannish
head
smells
of
malt
with
hints
of
roast
toffee
and
chocolate
tastes
like
roasted
malt
chocolate
there
is
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
not
terribly
full
though
in
the
mouth
the
malt
presence
is
decent
but
overall
its
a
bit
watery
again
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
nothing
too
complex
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
d
quite
good
dark
brown
nearly
opaque

topped
by
a
thin
ring
of
tan
coloured

flavour
and
aroma
were
intensely
malty
some
toffee
with
very
little
hop
presence
mild
bitterness
and
a
relatively
clean
yeast
character
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruitiness
some
residual
sweetness
with
a
short
malty
finish
medium
bodied
with
low

and
a
slightly
sweet

texture
damn
easy
to

not
too
filling
and
tasty
with
a
thirst
quenching
flavor
succeeds
despite
lacking
many
of
the
roastycaramel
flavors
and
truly
strong
hop
notes
that
i
typically
associate
with
the
style
smooth
slightly
sweet
and
crisp
regardless
drinks
almost
like
a
superdark
scottish
ale
thank
you
to
trbeer
for
splitting
a
pint
of
this
one
with
us
a
very
good
altbier
with
a
very
intersting
porter
characteristic
to
it
and
absolutely
something
id
hope
to
have
when
i
make
it
up
this
way
again
very
drinkable
ive
tried
other
beers
while
at
arbor
brewing
but
this
one
brings
me
in
the
door
one
of
my
favorites
at
abc
at
5
abv
its
a
comfortable
pleasing
drinking
companion
but
its
tasty
without
being
distracting
thats
why
i
love
the
alt
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
modest
edgewise
head
which
nonetheless
lasts
and
lasts
subtle
aroma
like
roasted
barley
and
malt
you
begin
with
great
tongue
and
throat
tickling
hops
and
perfectyes
perfectcarbonation
which
ensures
that
the
malt
and
barley
dont
come
close
to
suggesting
other
genres
such
as
porter
stout
or
dopplebock
no
the
hopscarbonation
balances
this
beer
that
rounds
out
a
finish
with
malt
roasted
barley
and
a
hint
of
caramel
that
while
smooth
refuses
to
suggest
any
sweetness
or
heavyhanded
microbrewing
flavor
overkills
a
really
fine
id
even
venture
elegant
beer
i
love
this
beer
even
some
german
altbiers
are
a
little
too
straightup
malty
but
not
this
one
definite
some
roasty
malts
in
there
but
also
some
toffeeish
coffee
chocolate
flavors
its
like
a
damn
starbucks
drink
the
toffee
cafe
choco
mocha
nut
brown
beer
fortunately
you
dont
need
one
of
those
little
cardboard
things
since
this
is
served
much
colder
than
coffee
but
just
right
at
justlessthancellar
temperature
nice
brown
color
too
like
a
very
dark
chocolate
bar
served
in
a
nice
500ml
german
mug
except
that
they
generally
overfill
it
a
bit
so
you
get
a
bit
more
than
your
500ml
this
deep
dark
altbier
is
the
best
i
have
had
outside
of
the
actual
german
beers
the
light
malt
aroma
introduces
a
complex
group
roasted
coffee
sweet
chocolate
and
hints
of
vanilla
the
extra
medium
body
is
creamy
on
the
palate
and
extremely
enjoyable
its
been
a
long
time
i
wanted
to
try
this
one
finally
got
my
hands
on
one
clear
beer
effervescent
too
amber
color
nice
creamy
head
thrones
on
top
of
it
malty
and
some
burnt
caramel
in
the
nose
tastewise
the
beer
is
more
roasted
malts
than
anything
else
very
refreshing
effervescent
too
but
still
sweet
in
the
mouth
light
body
to
medium
refreshing
and
delicious
a
good
summer
beer
with
lots
of
taste
cheers
overall
an
altbier
that
hits
all
the
marks
of
the
style
although
the
aroma
lacked
compared
to
the
taste
this
brew
is
still
an
enjoyable
one
enjoy
overall
too
much
bitterness
for
my
liking
without
any
counterbalance
decent
enough
but
i
liked
others
of
the
style
a
little
better
final

an
impressive
a
beaus
festivale
is
a
fine
session
amber
offering
an
interesting
harmony
between
the
sweet
biscuity
sweet
malts
and
its
grassy
noble
hop
bill
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favourite
offerings
from
this
brewery
this
is
the
second
bottle
ive
purchased
and
i
could
certainly
see
myself
picking
up
a
few
more
before
its
out
of
season
highly
recommended
to
any
fan
of
balanced
quaffable
amber
ales
final
thoughts
well
being
my
second
altbier
i
think
this
one
fared
better
then
the
first
the
yeast
was
toned
down
and
offered
other
nuances
that
were
interesting
it
strikes
me
as
a
beer
that
would
go
well
with
stuffed
peppers
and
rice
of
all
things
give
it
a
shot
o
smell
and
mouthfeel
are
great
but
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
lacking
o
i
really
enjoy
beaus
beers
not
just
for
their
beers
themselves
but
their
eagerness
to
brew
beers
that
are
less
than
favorable
to
the
masses
they
seem
to
brew
what
they
wantlike
and
not
worry
so
much
about
what
the
other
guy
is
doing
without
these
types
of
thinkers
alternative
styles
would
probably
have
disappeared
long
ago
m
light
to
medium
bodt
with
light
to
moderate
carbonation
o
i
love
this
beer
on
tap
but
its
pretty
good
in
bottle
form
too
i
like
this
style
of
beer
and
i
enjoyed
this
probably
wont
be
a
repeat
purchase
but
still
worth
trying
overall
nice
beer
from
a
great
brewery
good
summer
drinking
didnt
think
i
would
care
for
the
style
but
i
could
see
myself
buying
another
overall
a
great
summer
beer
and
incredibly
clean
taste
overall
its
a
cousin
to
their
lug
tread
ale
and
fairly
unimpressive
the
presentation
is
all
there
nice
looking
perhaps
why
the
price
is
a
bit
high
too
but
beaus
has
yet
to
win
me
over
into
multiple
bottle
purchases
and
that
continues
with
this
summer
seasonal
one
and
done
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavours
and
aromas
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
an
agreeable
flavourful
and
enjoyable
old
beer
it
stays
with
you
taunting
one
to
have
more
easy
to
drink
sessionstrength
good
stuff
a
good
looking
beer
but
not
the
most
exciting
in
flavour
fine
but
i
doubt
i
would
have
it
again
pours
a
rusty
copper
with
a
couple
of
fingers
of
offwhite
head
moderate
retention
and
some
pretty
good
lacing
nose
is
earthy
and
woody
some
caramel
and
dark
malts
dark
breads
and
more
earthyspicy
hop
notes
fairly
standard
from
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
altbiers
taste
has
more
earthiness
dark
bread
some
light
sweetness
and
moderate
grassiness
characteristic
organic
flavour
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
lot
of
beaus
offerings
quite
light
in
the
mouthfeel
moderate
bitterness
and
a
somewhat
crisp
finish
easily
drinkable
and
nice
within
the
style
i
hope
they
plan
on
barrelaging
this
as
part
of
the
greener
futures
project
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
like
some
more
aromatic
hops
andor
a
more
pronounced
malt
backbone
the
endnote
of
toasted
grain
is
really
nice
more
please
beaus
brewmaster
is
very
adept
at
reproducing
german
styles
as
the
flagship
lug
tread
ale
would
attest
but
few
people
outside
of
the
rhineland
have
succeeded
in
emulating
this
distinct
style
i
had
no
expectations
that
festiveale
would
be
as
good
as
it
actually
is
then
again
im
not
at
all
surprised
beaus
doesnt
make
a
habit
of
releasing
bad
beers
overall
theres
good
flavor
here
but
it
doesnt
feel
integrated
i
guess
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
brown
color
altbier
with
a
nice
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
light
caramelized
malt
with
dry
cereal
notes
taste
is
quite
refreshing
with
nice
notes
of
caramelized
malt
and
dry
cereal
with
very
subtle
lingering
sweetness
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
well
brewed
for
style
and
pleasantly
drinkable
od
im
a
little
torn
its
got
alot
of
flavour
im
just
not
sure
i
like
it
alot
its
good
but
not
a
jaw
dropper
a
little
too
earthy
its
really
smooth
but
not
exactly
refreshing
another
fine
product
from
beaus
of
vankleek
hill
whereas
beaus
lugtread
reallly
stands
out
especially
amongst
ontario
beers
festivale
is
merely
good
i
say
merely
because
i
was
hoping
that
it
would
be
exceptional
this
however
is
not
a
complaint
its
a
fine
malty
treat
with
a
butterscotch
chocolate
bottom
so
some
will
love
it
yet
another
strong
entry
from
beaus
and
a
nice
summer
seasonal
alternative
to
a
glut
of
wheat
beers
and
ipa
that
line
the
shelves
this
time
of
year
i
tried
this
beer
on
june
24
2011
at
the
beerbistro
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
red
colour
with
a
thin
white
cap
the
aroma
was
mild
caramel
malt
some
grains
floral
hops
and
spices
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
sweet
malt
toffee
fruity
and
spice
and
had
a
nice
bitter
bite
to
it
nose
is
fruity
cherries
and
dark
fruits
caramel
and
biscuity
malt
a
hint
of
honey
flavor
reveals
more
of
the
alt
characteristics
a
slight
metallic
nature
earthy
dryness
quite
a
hop
bite
on
this
one
as
per
style
still
some
fruit
a
light
sweetness
in
the
body
a
little
thin
on
the
body
a
little
low
on
the
carb
some
flaws
but
im
still
enjoying
it
enough
perhaps
its
not
in
top
condition
ill
have
to
revisit
again
overall
a
solid
beer
from
a
local
brewer
its
very
similar
to
the
beaver
river
ipeh
but
perhaps
a
little
more
earthiness
anyways
its
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
their
other
beers
pours
a
light
brown
colour
with
a
little
white
head
this
smells
similar
to
most
things
ive
tried
from
beaus
a
slight
malty
sweetness
with
a
big
earthy
aroma
very
well
balanced
slightly
bitter
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
finish
medium
body
very
nice
weight
i
would
drink
this
again
i
think
that
this
should
be
there
flagship
and
not
lug
tread
after
tasting
this
three
times
bottled
cask
and
keg
ive
finally
found
the
ideal
serving
format
and
this
makes
for
a
tasty
quaff
nice
job
guys
pours
a

of
bitterness
to
go
with
the
sweetness

the

stopped

nothing

blowing
good
altbier
not
a
brew
i
would
seek
out
to
try
again
flavor
profile
was
not
really
my
style
at
all
i
am
not
likly
to
try
again
o
tastes
like
someone
spilled
a
little
malt
syrup
into
a
heineken
first
sip
is
a
nice
rush
of
malty
sweetness
punctuated
by
a
crisp
dry
finish
minimal
hoppiness
some
fruity
yeast
flavors
poke
through
as
well
all
and
all
a
simple
malty
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
mf
a
little
too
much
body
actually
good
work
on
the
recipe
sh
taste
was
of
slightly
bitter
malt
and
not
much
else
i
keep
thinking
tootsie
roll
burnt
caramel
and
heavy
sweetness
are
unbalanced
by
and
hop
presence
i
dont
care
for
this
one
as
it
leaves
a
nasty
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
not
recommended
disappointed
because
i
know
southampton
can
do
better
than
this
the
cpj
d
nice
flavor
refreshing
carbonation
a
tad
too
heavy
to
be
a
session
beer
but
good
drinkability
none
the
less
drinkability
a
fantastic
ale
with
a
deep
complex
taste
that
isnt
upset
by
too
much
carbonation
it
is
a
well
balanced
brew
for
a
winter
day
d
really
drinkable
very
refreshing
and
an
enjoyable
but
by
no
means
mindblowing
beer
d
im
not
sure
where
they
were
going
with
this
one
a
lot
of
alcohol
flavor
for
a
low
abv
beer
the
beer
poured
out
a
medium
brown
with
hints
of
amberruby
in
it
great
tan
head
with
great
lacing
as
well
smells
earthy
with
a
slight
aroma
of
hops
some
fruits
grapes
not
very
prominent
its
not
a
very
intense
smell
medium
intensity
as
far
as
taste
light
body
i
can
tell
its
a
german
style
ale
but
the
taste
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
its
a
little
bitter
with
an
acidic
taste
slightly
sweet
the
after
taste
does
not
linger
around
at
all
i
picked
this
beer
up
last
minute
because
it
was
a
dollar
and
i
had
seen
it
around
i
can
kind
of
understand
why
it
was
only
a
dollar
at
this
point
pretty
good
stuff
even
being
almost
a
year
old
will
definitely
check
out
a
fresh
bottle
next
year
overall
nothing
that
i
got
too
excited
over
but
i
kind
of
knew
that
going
in
very
drinkable
but
not
very
interesting
so
far
i
havent
been
terribly
impressed
by
the
style
in
general
d
its
worth
finishing
but
i
wouldnt
order
another
as
an
alt
is
not
particularly
perfected
in
flavor
but
everything
seems
to
be
in
the
right
place
an
aged
beer
taste
without
a
syrup
that
makes
the
beer
flat
pour
is
amber
with
a
pretty
big
head
clear
nose
of
apple
and
honey
palate
comes
forth
with
a
malt
maple
syrup
quality
lean
and
simple
a
bit
floral
zest
that
comes
with
the
excessive
carbonation
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
that
actually
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
leaves
behind
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
really
quite
plain
there
are
some
really
really
faint
hints
of
nuts
as
well
as
some
lightlytoasted
bread
the
taste
is
slight
grain
and
a
bit
of
a
burnt
flavor
light
body
that
is
a
bit
burnt
does
not
drink
terribly
well
a
pity
concerning
how
infrequently
im
able
to
try
new
altbiers
in
the
states
d
if
you
like
drinking
clarified
butter
alongside
your
chardonnay
this
would
be
perfect
for
you
a
bit
too
much
for
me
to
handle
a
light
brownish
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
and
spots
of
lace
here
and
there
a
touch
of
retention
smell
is
quite
sweet
with
caramel
fruity
yeast
and
an
mild
earthy
hops
taste
is
big
toasted
malt
sweetness
and
mild
herbal
hops
some
light
nuttiness
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
tinged
sourness
in
the
finish
this
quickly
goes
to
a
leafy
hoppy
bitterness
a
touch
of
funkiness
in
a
german
way
a
light
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
fizziness
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
remarkable
certainly
quite
pleasant
very
sessionable
just
not
special
this
seems
to
be
a
summer
or
winter
beer
it
goes
down
very
easy
the
only
complaint
is
the
taste
doesnt
hang
around
this
was
a
great
deal
for
the
price
drink
well
my
friends
very
drinkable
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
thick
dark
amber
not
much
of
a
head
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
smells
of
sweet
spices
sweet
roasted
malt
taste
almonds
and
caramel
a
medium
body
with
hardly
any
carbonation
a
dry
finish
overall
a
well
crafted
brew
could
have
had
more
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
sweet
up
front
but
with
a
good
level
of
dryness
in
the
back
carbonation
level
is
on
the
high
side
but
feels
like
a
great
level
i
appreciated
this
beer
enjoyed
it
and
didnt
find
any
flaws
in
it
but
for
some
reason
im
not
grabbing
for
a
second
i
think
this
would
be
great
for
the
right
occasion
and
its
a
welcome
part
of
the
mixed
12
pack
d
tough
to
call
as
this
beer
wasnt
offensive
but
wasnt
fantastic
either
my
impression
is
that
the
brewers
attempted
to
stay
within
the
classic
style
and
did
a
pretty
good
job
crisp
and
clean
with
moderately
sweet
malt
notes
and
a
slightly
acidic
finish
appropriate
lagerlike
characteristics
now
i
just
need
some
nice
roasted
sausages
and
mustard
meh
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
offering
from
these
guys
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
traditional
german
alt
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
had
the
traditional
german
maltiness
with
the
hoppiness
that
is
present
in
alts
not
too
shabby
a
toasty
coffeelike
experience
in
the
taste
a
dash
of
fruit
fits
the
style
mild
to
the
mouth
and
a
touch
of
acidity
lightmedium
body
noticeably
attenuated
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
mind
having
one
of
these
brews
with
breakfast
my
only
complaint
is
the
complete
lack
of
head
retention
overall
i
approve
dark
orange
amber
with
a
thick
sand
colored
head
that
leaves
blobs
of
lace
on
the
glass
as
it
melts
mild
and
toasted
malt
with
an
equally
mild
herbal
hop
aroma
nice
and
toasty
grain
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
a
spicy
herbal
hop
quality
light
and
effervescent
but
flavorful
a
nice
beer
and
a
style
i
dont
often
seek
out
im
glad
i
did
pours
a
dark
but
clear
brown
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
scent
is
of
roasted
nuts
bready
yeasts
piney
hops
and
a
slight
whiff
of
herbal
taste
is
clean
and
clear
with
a
minimal
impact
from
roasted
nuts
slight
carmel
sweetness
nice
background
of
piney
and
herbal
hops
as
well
as
bready
yeasts
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
a
decent
tasting
beer
nothing
too
special
otherwise
d
good
for
a
couple
but
that
would
be
it
while
it
is
nice
to
drink
after
the
second
i
was
ready
to
try
something
else
nothing
too
impressive
about
this
beer
but
certainly
not
bad
a
pretty
good
alt
but
maybe
a
little
bit
too
much
of
nut
flavor
to
be
perfectly
on
style
i
bought
this
as
part
of
a
mix
six
pack
that
included
a
couple
of
southampton
styles
including
the
ipa
which
i
liked
a
lot
this
one
was
not
as
good
but
also
enjoyable
and
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
dark
brown
interesting
yeast
character
not
much
on
the
aroma
but
overall
a
good
session
beer
in
the
feeling
there
is
a
crisp
refreshing
character
upfront
then
turns
a
bit
creamy
and
finishes
with
an
oily
slickness
overall
this
would
hold
well
against
any
german
made
altbier
oddly
it
has
better
appearance
traits
than
most
originals
overall
hard
to
want
more
than
one
this
was
a
disappoinment
just
barely
ok
what
is
good
is
drinkable
but
this
is
a
flawed
beer
wont
have
this
one
again
d
a
pretty
good
beer
that
needs
to
tone
down
the
oversweetness
but
keep
the
hoppiness
not
really
worth
seeking
out
by
if
it
is
around
give
it
a
shot
d
for
such
a
delicate
style
this
one
has
nothing
to
hide
no
flaws
highly
sessionable
and
a
pleasure
to
quaff
slightly
bitter
finish
just
a
tad
more
than
found
in
a
german
alt
but
i
must
say
this
is
the
best
american
alt
so
true
to
form
that
i
have
tried
so
far
d
the
flavor
is
interesting
enough
where
i
would
want
to
have
this
beer
again
when
im
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
in
different
styles
drinks
ok
highly
carbonated
and
a
pour
finish
makes
it
harder
to
get
through
i
actually
thought
this
was
a
great
true
to
style
alt
with
a
nice
clean
grainy
maltiness
and
dry
finish
as
it
should
be
the
characteristics
of
what
i
suspect
to
be
a
german
ale
yeast
strain
come
through
nicely
as
compared
to
other
domestics
which
call
themselves
alts
but
seem
more
like
american
ambers
to
me
generally
too
fruity
or
sweet
for
the
style
d
a
session
brew
for
the
generic
ale
or
lighter
brown
ale
fan
the
5
abv
goes
over
as
a
standard
for
such
activity
but
adds
to
this
brews
mediocrity
imo
sort
of
like
a
newcastle
and
long
trail
ale
combined
into
one
tried
to
get
cute
with
the
branding
on
this
one
but
its
just
dressing
up
an
average
ale
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
nice
smoky
undertone
and
a
hint
of
molasses
it
pours
a
clear
coppery
brown
with
a
rather
thin
head
malty
flavor
has
just
a
whisper
of
molasses
and
a
bit
of
a
tinny
hint
texture
is
smooth
not
very
tingly
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
ok
nonetheless
goes
ok
not
as
flavorful
as
many
altbiers
ive
had
and
it
has
an
aftertaste
similar
to
chewing
on
tinfoil
but
ive
had
worse
d
lightbodied
and
quite
sessionable
nice
and
refreshing
enjoyed
sipping
it
on
the
patio
in
memphis
in
90degree
humidity
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
but
really
is
just
too
bland
for
me
i
wouldnt
be
offended
by
it
and
it
wouldnt
offend
if
it
was
at
a
party
but
it
just
is
kind
of
lackluster
drinkability
is
good
not
too
much
one
way
or
the
other
with
this
one
goes
down
really
easy
and
is
an
inviting
brew
easily
could
see
this
being
a
popular
sessionable
brew
though
just
sort
of
too
mild
for
my
liking
single
from
a
mixasix
pack
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brown
glossy
color
not
much
head
at
all
smell
was
a
bit
malty
if
anything
taste
was
average
at
best
mostly
a
malt
and
nutty
flavor
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
yes
this
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
it
is
totally
forgettable
no
real
redeeming
qualities
boring
pours
a
nice
medium
brown
color
big
fluffy
head
to
it
dont
see
this
style
of
beer
around
too
often
but
do
thoroughly
enjoy
the
few
beers
ive
had
of
it
long
trail
ale
otter
creek
copper
ale
nutty
sort
of
aroma
to
this
one
light
to
medium
bodied
pretty
good
mouthfeel
taste
is
a
bit
watery
reminds
me
of
a
not
so
good
brown
ale
definitely
a
malty
one
doughy
notes
not
the
best
alt
ive
had
but
sill
a
decent
beer
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
a
nice
beer
on
a
cold
new
england
night
this
beer
seemed
one
dimensional
to
me
i
could
not
shake
the
thought
of
malt
every
time
i
took
a
sip
it
was
not
bad
but
not
one
id
reach
for
again
given
a
bunch
of
choices
pours
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
more
than
a
finger
of
white
head
composed
mostly
of
big
bubbles
head
receeds
slowly
leaving
a
sticky
amount
of
lace
on
the
glassware
and
a
ring
or
line
identifys
just
about
every
sip
taken
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
caramel
is
offset
by
a
bit
of
hops
upon
taking
the
first
sip
one
of
the
first
things
noticed
is
how
crisp
this
beer
is
then
you
start
to
note
the
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
that
are
present
however
a
downside
is
that
it
also
has
some
sulfur
twang
to
it
finish
is
quite
crisp
but
the
taste
of
sulfur
lingers
along
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
that
balances
out
the
malt
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
bit
more
of
the
sulfur
comes
out
along
with
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
taste
that
almost
makes
this
beer
seem
young
or
green
this
beer
has
a
caramel
malt
aroma
a
thick
head
and
a
dark
amber
color
it
starts
sweet
and
finishes
dry
its
flavor
is
mostly
of
a
buttery
caramel
and
some
slightly
roasted
malts
this
is
a
very
drinkable
almost
to
drinkable
for
a
smaller
brewery
this
beer
has
its
place
but
its
not
for
me
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
for
people
that
like
anything
darker
than
a
wheat
beer
opinion
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
it
doesnt
take
me
there
but
the
bitterness
and
overall
presentation
make
me
think
that
this
is
the
style
that
they
were
trying
to
hit
it
isnt
like
a
true
altbier
but
that
may
be
alleviated
if
there
were
some
more
cold
conditioning
to
take
place
on
this
beer
either
way
it
isnt
bad
and
i
will
drink
the
whole
bottle
i
would
recommend
trying
it
if
you
want
an
idea
of
what
the
style
tastes
like
but
you
really
have
to
go
there
to
know
for
sure
d
seems
like
it
is
restrained
but
looking
to
take
off
and
interesting
interplay
of
light
fruits
and
darker
carameltoffee
on
a
solid
toasty
roasty
base
the
body
is
between
moderate
and
light
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
more
body
but
its
ok
carbonation
is
low
as
well
overall
a
good
beer
very
easy
to
drink
but
would
like
to
see
more
character
and
depth
md
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
easy
drinking
overall
a
rather
average
beer
certainly
true
to
style
but
nothing
remarkable
about
it
d
tasty
enough
low
abv
can
drink
plenty

boring

back
a

of

drinkability
i
am
not
overly
impressed
with
this
the
flavor
and
balance
seems
a
bit
weak
i
will
be
passing
on
this
in
the
future
d
it
is

very
good
though
the
abv
seems
to
be

pretty

more
spicy
earthy

qualities
and
slight
syrupy

it
dries
off
quite
a

though
and
the
bitterness
builds
as
it
goes
a
pretty
decent
alt
could
use
a
little
more
abv
but
its
got
a
nice
body
and
good
sweetness
and
bitterness
i
think
seems
to
be
pretty
underrated
from
the
current
score
d
this
beer
looks
so
sexy
that
it
makes
me
forget
it
doesnt
taste
all
that
great
if
they
dropped
the
diacetyl
made
it
more
bitter
and
dried
it
out
this
beer
would
be
a
fantastic
session
beer
however
given
what
it
is
i
dont
want
much
more
my
first
altbier
experience
not
sure
what
to
expect
its
copper
brown
color
slightly
cloudy
with
carbonation
becomes
apparent
as
its
poured
from
the
dark
bottle
into
my
tulip
pint
glass
the
head
fading
fast
smells
and
tastes
a
little
like
becks
dark
lager
with
its
malt
heavy
character
subsequent
whiffs
yield
a
cheeselike
funk
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
unexpected
malt
is
the
major
player
tastewise
although
the
hops
seem
to
prevent
the
ale
from
becoming
too
onenoted
the
ale
has
a
smooth
light
mouthfeel
and
i
feel
like
that
helps
its
overall
drinkability
and
prevents
the
maltiness
from
becoming
cloying
shs
alt
pouts
a
clear
deep
filtered
brownish
amber
body
with
a
white
head
that
looks
solid
and
sticks
around
for
a
good
long
while
leaving
plenty
of
lacing
from
the
look
carbonation
is
rather
high
on
this
one
the
aroma
is
sweet
bready
malt
theres
not
really
any
fruitiness
to
it
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
malt
along
with
some
hop
character
to
balance
things
out
a
bit
i
am
glad
southampton
chose
saaz
rather
than
hallertauer
hops
for
this
one
the
spice
pairs
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
the
use
of
the
munich
malt
along
with
some
wheat
help
to
give
this
beer
a
good
body
i
would
say
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
along
the
lighter
side
of
medium
drinkability
would
be
rather
high
for
this
as
it
is
brewed
per
style
and
alts
are
something
to
be
sessioned
anyways
didnt
fall
in
love
with
it
but
a
decent
enough
brew
very
drinkable
and
well
crafted
and
delicious
drinkability
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
this
one
the
metallic
taste
tends
to
overpower
whatever
else
is
there
go
elsewhere
drinkability
not
terrible
but
could
be
so
much
better
this
beer
has
lots
of
potential
but
the
metal
taste
in
it
makes
it
not
very
desirable
not
my
usual
cup
o
tea
but
would
probably
be
a
big
hit
with
those
who
like
german
style
ales
southampton
altbier
tastes
and
feels
like
a
dark
runofthemill
lager
and
completely
lacks
the
substance
of
decent
old
ale
this
is
a
robust
yet
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
very
nice
malt
profile
sweet
but
not
overly
so
hopped
with
perfect
finesse
i
dont
know
much
about
altbiers
but
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
one
from
what
i
know
it
seems
adequately
fitting
to
the
style
mouthfeel
not
overly
carbonated
light
on
the
tongue
overall
an
ok
depiction
of
the
style
but
a
little
off
balance
with
the
strong
caramel
taste
that
being
said
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
is
not
offensive
in
any
way
if
i
brewed
it
i
would
be
happy
if
you
get
the
chance
try
this
beer
poured
a
medium
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
vanished
smell
is
very
malty
taste
is
similar
with
a
little
fruit
maybe
bananas
but
i
cant
quite
place
the
taste
and
no
noticeable
hops
the
taste
is
good
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
unpleasant
not
bad
but
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
try
again
pours
a
nice
amberbrown
good
head
but
it
left
no
lacing
on
my
glass
nicely
carbonated
the
aroma
is
slightly
spicy
and
you
can
clearly
smell
the
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
mostly
malt
up
front
and
finishes
hoppy
drinkability
wise
its
solid
and
easy
to
go
down
but
as
it
gets
warm
it
gets
a
little
harsher
overall
a
good
beer
worth
a
try
notes
this
is
nice
style
of
beer
that
can
certainly
be
enjoyed
anytime
of
year
cheers
d
high
this
is
nicely
crafted
for
the
style
and
is
a
reasonable
session
beer
this
is
an
easytodrink
beer
that
is
true
to
style
nice
beer
very
drinkable
i
like
it
so
much
i
will
be
buy
a
case
of
it
for
my
next
bbq
party
excellent

beer
12oz

a
clear
dark
ruddy
brown
with
a
light
tan

strong
caramel

smell
with

bready
slight
yeasty

dark
fruity
taste
with
a
lot
of
bready
crystal

character
slightly
roasty
littleno
hop
character
the
taste
is
nice
but
not
very
reminiscent
of
a
traditional
alt
wish
it
were
drier
given
the
quality
of
this
one
i
will
now
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
pours
a
four
finger

head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
almost
clear
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
light
hoppy
nose
flavor
is
smooth
almost
sweet
becomes
citrusy
and
sour
lingering
sour
citrus
taste
maybe
this
is
a
bad
bottle
quite
different
from
their
secret
ale
1
60
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
beverage
warehouse
winooski
vt
the
foam
was
wheat
colored
light
bubbly
the
color
was
a
dark
honey
amber
with
gold
highlights
the
smell
was
of
a
basic
american
pils
and
some
wheat
hints
nothing
special
the
taste
was
like
and
american
style
lager
with
some
heaviness
some
citrus
highlights
nothing
too
special
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
drinkability
average
w
more
of
a
citrus
aftertaste
d
all
in
all
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
definitely
not
a
new
favorite
of
mine
but
better
than
bmc
any
day
pours
to
a
clear
copper
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
you
can
tell
malt
is
king
from
the
smell
taste
is
malty
sweet
goodness
with
a
light
hop
finish
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
very
drinkable
it
has
the
malty
sweetness
i
have
been
craving
lately
mmm
pours
a
medium
copper
hue
with
a
head
that
leaves
quickly
the
smell
is
real
sweet
someone
else
hit
it
on
the
head
with
the
chocolate
caramel
vibe
the
taste
is
smooth
and
balanced
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
but
nothing
outstanding
in
my
opinion
malty
sweetness
with
a
nice
finish
this
is
my
first
southampton
beer
not
a
bad
shot
boys
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
style
beer
this
is
a
good
representation
of
an
alt
i
may
be
able
to
drink
another
in
the
night
drinkability
is
ok
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
then
again
not
really
my
thing
the
buttery
notes
are
dangerously
strong
but
this
recipe
keeps
everything
in
balance
amazing
it
is
almost
like
a
highwire
act
this
could
have
gone
horribly
wrong
but
instead
it
is
brilliant
creamy
smooth
altbier
is
designed
to
be
a
lower
abv
brew
which
can
be
drunk
in
large
quantity
and
this
offering
succeeds
d
hmmm
not
awful
but
if
i
wanted
to
taste
chlorine
id
jump
in
a
pool
not
impressed
big
bodied
thick
and
almost
syrupy
an
interesting
style
to
me
with
a
lot
to
offer
in
a
small
abv
package
id
drink
this
beer
again
for
sure
malty
sweetness
thats
like
caramel
and
some
toffee
a
hop
balance
adds
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
to
the
overall
taste
this
was
lighter
then
i
would
have
guessed
from
its
look
and
smell
the
texture
is
good
and
a
bit
heavy
on
the
tongue
would
drink
again
and
again
and
pours
a
rich
dark
caramel
with
a
nice
frothy
head
smell
has
a
deep
aroma
of
malt
witha
hint
of
spice
underneath
taste
is
initially
malty
but
a
lemon
like
bitterness
creeps
in
and
reamins
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
almost
lambiclike
a
tad
sour
this
also
impacts
the
drinkability
of
the
product
clear
dark
copper
moderate
amounts
of
carbonation
stream
through
the
body
head
is
slight
and
beige
rich
sweet
smell
of
toffee
a
staple
of
a
good
alt
though
this
aroma
is
richer
than
most
nice
flavor
is
chalk
full
of
toffee
vanilla
nuts
and
caramel
maybe
a
titch
sweet
for
my
personal
standard
but
still
quite
enjoyable
sparsely
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
this
is
quite
the
easy
drinker
thanks
to
big
ol
zap
for
the
south
dakota
sample
d
this
beer
is
good
i
can
slam
one
real
fast
then
sip
these
all
night
great
for
my
first
altbier
d
overall
southampton
altbier
is
a
beer
true
to
style
and
pretty
tasty
definitely
worth
a
shot
recommended
the
taste
is
refreshing
some
white
grape
slight
sazz
slight
skunk
and
some
graininess
its
an
unusual
taste
the
texture
fits
well
enough
this
was
a
weird
a
beer
but
good
enough
to
try
again
im
interested
to
see
what
else
this
style
has
to
offer
d
on
the
whole
an
easy
to
drink
beer
though
not
exactly
mindblowing
very
smooth
on
the
palate
dominated
more
by
malt
than
hops
smooth
but
good
d
thats
a
tasty
brew
that
goes
down
well
and
shows
their
quality
at
work
well
made
and
easily
enjoyable
d
honestly
a
no
thrills
drink
wouldnt
invest
in
a
6
pack
or
recommend
here
didnt
make
me
look
forward
to
the
next
sip
and
found
it
to
be
fizzy
and
boring
with
much
better
examples
out
there
i
suggest
looking
else
where
for
a
good
alt
this
isnt
it
d
a
nice
easy
drinking
american
alt
i
could
knock
back
more
than
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
the
evening
an
okay
altbier
though
not
quite
at
the
top
of
my
list
nafsxrs
d
this
is
a
really
nice
session
beer
i
found
myself
thoroughly
enjoying
my
first
glass
and
looking
forward
to
the
next
a
very
nice
beer
for
me
solid
brew
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
md
medium
to
light
body
with
a
high
frothy
carbonation
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
clear
hot
day
done
of
my
favorite
alts
had
a
sixer
of
this
at
the
hotel
in
sioux
falls
and
liked
it
so
much
i
got
some
more
to
bring
back
very
flavorful
malt
forward
alt
solid
alt
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
browns
but
want
something
a
little
lighter
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
made
altbiers
i
have
tasted
it
isnt
on
par
yet
with
their
german
fathers
but
a
darn
good
brew
i
strongly
recommend
this
bier
prosit
this
is
obviously
not
my
style
of
beer
dont
think
i
will
try
it
again
and
am
not
sure
if
i
am
even
qualified
to
review
it
take
that
into
account
when
reading
this
beer
is
a
decent
alt
i
think
a
bit
more
hoppiness
would
have
been
nice
provided
the
beer
stayed
crisp
great
beer
i
grabbed
one
in
a
mixasix
and
i
am
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
as
its
been
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
for
those
that
enjoy
the
style
id
definitely
buy
again
but
it
wont
be
a
regular
theres
really
not
much
more
to
say
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
not
a
whole
lot
happening
easy
drinking
session
beer
this
is
my
first
atbier
it
did
not
do
much
for
me
i
hope
i
can
try
some
better
examples
in
the
future
it
has
a
roasty
aroma
with
a
mild
hops
scent
hanging
out
in
the
background
it
has
a
tan
soapy
head
that
settles
over
a
brown
body
it
has
a
weak
dusseldorf
flavor
with
roasted
malt
tones
the
body
is
watery
with
not
much
for
carbonation
i
think
this
beer
is
just
above
average
poured
a
seethru
copper
with
twofinger
white
head
that
quickly
dies
and
leaves
some
lace
on
top
of
a
malty
caramel
roasted
bread
aroma
with
hints
of
citric
hops
smooth
slightly
creamy
easypassing
beer
with
some
fruits
figs
tropical
i
cant
tell
they
are
a
little
left
of
center
mixed
with
roasted
toasted
caramel
toffee
malts
not
bad
but
the
taste
seems
slightly
off
and
there
was
a
funky
aftertaste
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
too
much
i
should
have
had
one
or
two
and
moved
on
its
nice
to
see
american
craft
brewers
take
on
the
alt
and
its
even
nicer
to
see
it
done
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
clean
with
good
carbonation
recommended
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thin
beige
head
nose
has
fruity
malts
pitted
fruit
and
spicy
german
yeast
peppery
yeast
plays
a
big
part
in
balancing
the
sweet
malts
in
the
flavor
as
well
crisp
body
is
well
carbonated
and
drinks
easy
good
session
ale
from
southampton
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
i
had
previously
only
had
this
brewerys
white
ale
which
was
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
hunt
this
beer
down
or
order
it
at
the
bar
but
i
will
drink
5
more
seeing
that
i
bought
a
6
pack
this
beer
has
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
slight
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
light
toastiness
a
touch
of
caramel
and
grains
the
flavor
follows
this
with
a
solid
maltiness
composed
of
caramel
and
biscuit
notes
bitterness
is
low
disappointingly
but
otherwise
the
flavor
is
clean
the
body
is
a
tad
thin
and
watery
i
have
not
had
many
opportunities
to
sample
this
this
old
german
style
of
ale
i
suspect
many
breweries
prefer
the
more
aggresively
hopped
ales
much
in
demand
these
days
this
is
an
oppropriate
ale
for
any
season
and
extremely
drinkable
ive
never
had
a
subpar
beer
from
southampton
and
this
one
is
another
pleasant
brew
to
enjoy
nothing
earth
shattering
to
be
sure
but
a
very
good
altbier
appearance
is
a
a
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
turns
to
a
simple
white
foam
ring
smell
has
malt
caramel
and
some
more
malt
taste
is
interesting
a
bit
metallic
some
sweetness
as
well
mouthfeel
has
spice
aftertaste
is
faintly
like
a
werthers
original
candy
drinkability
is
a
little
above
average
despite
how
my
description
of
his
altbier
may
sound
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
and
it
is
unique
very
refreshing
and
sessionable
i
would
like
to
explore
other
examples
of
this
style
not
a
chart
topper
but
a
nice
beer
the
sweet
slightly
fruity
profile
of
this
ale
combined
with
considerable
smoothenss
help
to
make
this
beer
one
that
can
be
consistently
enjoyed
the
only
real
detraction
in
this
review
results
from
the
fact
that
the
most
significant
characteristic
of
the
beers
aroma
was
its
insignificance
though
perhaps
appropriate
for
the
style
the
aroma
seemed
too
subtle
to
appreciate
mellowed
from
extended
conditioning
and
with
a
balanced
though
slightly
sweet
flavor
profile
this
altbier
makes
for
an
exceptional
session
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
local
44
in
philly
poured
an
amber
brown
with
thin
white
head
smell
was
malty
and
bready
taste
was
similar
with
light
hops
in
the
finish
nothing
too
complex
just
a
decent
beer
good
session
beer
if
theres
nothing
better
available
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
and
not
of
a
style
that
people
typically
get
too
ampedup
about
pleasant
and
id
recommend
it
if
you
are
into
the
style
if
not
cruise
past
it
and
pickup
whatever
dipa
or
ris
is
the
rage
today
i
like
this
i
like
it
a
lot
its
very
easily
drinkable
its
very
tasty
and
its
very
smooth
altbiers
in
general
are
easily
described
as
such
but
this
is
a
great
example
d
well
balanced
first
time
i
had
this
style
of
beer
i
will
try
some
more
as
this
beer
was
decent
d
an
easy
session
beer
with
some
decent
flavors
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
beer
stop
in
hazleton
for
1
75
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
and
appears
a
clear
copper
color
akin
to
cream
soda
with
a
full
inch
of
super
creamy
light
tan
foam
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
and
tastes
of
lightly
roasted
grains
sweet
caramel
malt
light
grassy
hops
crisp
finish
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
a
flavorful
highly
drinkable
ale
the
first
taste
was
sweet
but
not
tangy
the
feel
was
easy
with
no
sting
to
the
pallete
went
down
easy
d
glass
was
empty
pretty
quick
this
is
a
good
beer
i
had
this
bottle
with
a
burger
for
lunch
and
it
went
down
might
fine
i
probably
will
pick
a
six
of
this
to
go
to
a
cook
out
this
summer
it
would
be
a
great
change
of
pace
good
may
have
to
give
this
one
another
go
i
was
looking
for
a
smooth
beer
this
left
a
nasty
after
taste
i
had
to
pour
it
out
i
can
pack
these
away
i
polished
off
4
before
i
even
really
realized
it
a
good
pour
forms
a
fizzy
cap
of
bone
colored
head
that
settles
down
to
a
soft
pillowy
layer
about
a
centimeter
thick
with
good
retention
underneath
is
on
the
darker
side
of
coppery
amber
bubbles
seem
to
rise
without
much
resistance
aromas
are
led
by
buttered
toast
followed
by
some
toffee
and
a
touch
of
butterscotch
and
earthy
hop
smell
is
a
fairly
good
representation
of
the
taste
toffee
first
then
some
butterscotch
comes
into
the
mix
very
smooth
malty
flavors
some
pleasant
ester
fruitiness
finishes
with
a
kiss
of
earthy
german
hops
man
the
feel
is
so
smooth
bordering
on
velvety
with
just
enough
carbonation
a
very
tasty
beer
that
you
can
definitely
enjoy
a
few
of
drinkability
is
good
for
this
one
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
and
one
that
i
would
welcome
at
social
events
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
great
beer
in
a
very
underrepresented
style
it
reminds
me
somewhat
of
an
english
bitter
and
like
the
bitter
it
needs
more
true
to
style
american
interpretations
imo
drinkability
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
one
will
work
for
a
few
pints
if
you
want
something
malty
and
not
geared
towards
hops
this
one
will
do
the
trick
d
very
smooth
very
balanced
and
still
falvorful
a
good
session
beer
when
you
remove
the
hops
and
sweetness
from
a
brown
this
is
what
you
get
its
a
thin
flavor
palate
but
for
me
it
hits
a
spot
that
a
lot
of
browns
smother
with
sweetness
or
blow
up
with
hops
d
this
is
a
nice
altbier
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
a
nice
session
brew
for
me
this
is
a
good
session
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
them
and
the
lack
of
sweetness
helps
to
drive
that
home
i
suppose
it
also
helps
that
i
like
altbier
as
well
not
that
my
review
would
influence
anyones
opinion
but
after
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
choking
down
one
and
then
weeks
later
pouring
the
second
down
the
drain
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
sucks
or
if
i
dont
like
altbier
in
general
i
will
make
it
my
mission
to
try
another
altbier
soon
so
ill
know
the
answer
until
then
i
just
dont
like
this
beer
i
had
the
secret
ale
about
a
year
ago
and
was
not
overly
impereesed
with
itthis
i
liked
better
poured

ale
hops
make
an
appearance
but
mostly
creep
along
in
the
backseat
as
the
malts
are
the
main
attraction
here
pretty
good
flavor
and
high
drinkability
make
this
a
nice
fall
or
spring
session
beer
overall
impression
pretty
drinkable
a
bit
different
than
some
of
the
other
amber
type
beers
you
see
more
of
i
wouldnt
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
for
it
though
personally
ive
enjoyed
altbier
but
unfortunately
there
are
far
too
few
brewers
willing
or
interested
enough
to
make
an
effort
to
produce
it
allinall
the
southampton
expression
makes
for
a
wonderful
quaff
and
will
surely
compensate
for
ones
inability
to
make
it
over
to
germany
d
my
impression
is
well
like
a
macro
drinkable
but
id
want
something
that
has
more
flavor
d
really
quite
good
this
is
a
good
session
beer
d
alts
are
quickly
becoming
a
goto
session
beer
for
me
this
one
could
use
a
bit
more
balancing
towards
the
hop
side
but
its
a
solid
beer
a
nice
sized
fluffy
white
head
sits
patiently
atop
a
light
brown
redstreaked
brew
after
calmly
receding
some
peaks
of
lace
are
left
behind
aroma
includes
big
notes
of
toasted
grain
some
earthiness
dark
licorice
and
hops
tastes
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
clear
running
stream
water
theres
some
fruitiness
in
the
background
along
with
a
subtle
spike
of
alcohol
the
beer
goes
down
fairly
smooth
and
has
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
unique
brew
that
maintains
some
obvious
elements
of
a
brown
while
also
presenting
some
of
its
own
characteristics
pours
a
clear
orangebrown
not
much
head
retention
lacing
for
a
couple
of
inches
smell
butter
caramel
toasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
grainy
earthy
hops
taste
grainy
earthy
toasted
caramel
tea
buttery
and
vague
nutty
and
fruity
flavors
this
is
alright
personally
would
like
less
butter
its
kind
of
a
bland
beer
its
doesnt
do
anything
that
jumps
out
androginous
if
you
will
but
its
easy
to
drink
kind
of
a
base
beer
d
very
drinkable
liked
this
beer
a
lot
drinks
okay
but
this
is
a
shadow
of
the
secret
ale
imo
will
try
again
if
i
can
assure
myself
i
am
getting
fresh
product
d
this
beer
has
a
great
malt
bill
that
taste
fresh
yet
smooth
and
subtle
with
some
complexity
still
coming
through
the
hops
are
just
a
bit
bigger
that
the
malt
but
not
overpowering
this
is
a
very
smooth
delicious
beer
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
with
lower
amounts
of
carbonation
which
are
appropriate
for
this
one
the
finish
is
perfect
not
dry
but
almost
hinting
at
it
everything
seems
to
work
well
with
this
one
nothing
outstanding
about
it
but
nothing
damning
either
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
see
it
pairing
with
food
quite
nicely
this
is
one
that
i
can
see
myself
picking
up
again
in
the
future
and
for
the
price
it
is
definitely
worth
it
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
big
foamy
tan
head
smells
deliciously
toasty
taste
is
also
very
toasty
with
also
some
biscuity
malts
balanced
by
a
nice
earthy
bitterness
not
the
most
complicated
altbier
out
there
but
a
very
solid
one
that
i
greatly
enjoy
drinking
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
which
only
helps
the
drinkability
this
would
be
a
good
tailgating
beer
to
drink
copiously
with
some
brats
and
onions
good
freshness
per
the
date
pours
a
respectable
translucent
brown
with
about
34
of
an
inch
head
good
lacing
as
you
drink
the
scent
is
of
biscuity
malt
and
lager
to
me
there
is
a
noticeable
twang
that
one
might
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
rather
dry
this
subsides
and
there
is
a
subtle
sweetness
left
on
the
tongue
this
one
is
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
i
could
imagine
this
being
a
decent
session
beer
if
this
relatively
obscure
style
is
to
your
liking
d
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
style
somewhat
complex
and
interesting
an
ale
that
finishes
like
a
lager
would
be
great
on
a
nice
fall
day
some
odd
off
flavors
bring
this
down
a
notch
or
two
darker
than
the
average
alt
good
clarity
and
a
nice
strong
white
head
sweet
caramel
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
subtle
hop
character
going
on
fruity
balanced
and
a
very
easy
drinker
lightmedium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
aftertaste
one
of
the
better
american
altbiers
ive
tried
mouth
is
decently
carbonated
does
not
drink
all
too
easy
i
might
be
a
newbie
for
albier
but
if
this
is
a
good
representation
i
dont
want
to
try
another
md
light
bodied
with
out
much
flavor
to
it
easy
drinking
but
nothing
too
memorable
probably
wont
try
again
the
search
for
the
best
altbierstyle
craft
brew
reaches
a
new
height
this
new
beer
from
southampton
may
simply
be
a
secret
ale
repackage
job
but
the
color
mouthfeel
and
flavor
are
extremely
close
to
the
popular
german
breweriesat
least
so
far
as
bottles
go
i
have
missed
frankenheim
alt
since
it
was
no
longer
imported
and
i
had
not
seen
this
before
on
the
local
shelves
wells
in
towson
but
i
love
the
other
southampton
brews
ive
tried
including
the
secret
ale
and
so
didnt
hesitate
to
pull
a
6pack
from
the
shelf
in
fact
i
bought
two
the
packaging
described
a
dusseldorfstyle
alt
and
i
think
theyve
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
in
fact
the
label
says
the
brewmaster
went
to
dusseldorf
to
study
the
altbier
style
what
a
pleasant
surprise
fantastic
deep
mahogany
color
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
the
unmistakable
scent
of
malt
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
reminiscent
of
frankenheim
though
maybe
a
bit
richer
and
a
touch
sweeter
and
nuttierand
much
fresher
a
bit
darker
and
less
fruity
than
some
other
craftbrewed
alts
and
i
may
actually
be
ready
to
suggest
that
iits
better
than
the
legendary
long
trail
alt
but
until
i
can
do
a
sidebyside
and
until
i
can
actually
buy
long
trail
anywhere
in
maryland
this
will
be
a
welcome
addition
to
the
fridge
incidentally
this
is
one
beer
that
sneaks
up
on
you
as
a
session
offering
because
there
is
no
taste
of
alcoholnone
its
just
rich
malty
goodness
from
beginning
to
end
good
stuff
i
am
a
happy
beer
lover
today
ill
buy
this
stuff
by
the
case
and
thanks
to
ba
magazine
for
the
timely
altbier
article
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
citrusy
taste
is
caramelcitrus
and
bready
this
to
me
is
very
boring
and
bland
its
watery
and
the
flavors
are
very
weak
probably
worth
one
try
but
this
is
not
something
i
see
myself
pursuing
in
the
future
d
a
session
beer
in
tap
not
as
enjoyable
from
the
bottle
lots
of
carbonation
a
tad
too
much
methinks
but
that
makes
everything
go
down
easily
even
if
the
beer
burps
are
a
bit
plentiful
i
like
the
taste
d
this
beer
met
my
expectations
and
was
good
with
my
spicy
food
southamptons
offerings
never
blow
me
away
but
they
are
always
of
good
quality
and
as
i
drift
from
extreme
beer
styles
to
more
traditional
i
appreciate
their
wellcrafted
traditionalstyle
beers
more
and
more
well
i
hope
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
old
side
due
the
subtle
funk
i
get
but
any
ways
poured
a
nice
orange
mahogany
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
left
the
glass
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
aromas
are
of
spicy
german
hops
freshly
made
pancakes
and
wheat
toast
there
is
a
little
caramel
going
on
but
only
in
the
background
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
smooth
up
front
with
a
light
carbonation
then
smooths
out
and
turns
medium
bodied
slightly
dries
out
and
leaves
a
sort
of
gumminess
on
the
palette
like
i
said
i
hope
this
is
just
an
old
sixer
of
this
stuff
it
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
fresh
maple
leaf
reddish
hue
with
a
fine
layer
of
creamy
foam
head
retention
is
very
good
and
tons
of
carbonation
is
visible
ascending
upward
aroma
is
sort
of
mild
with
grainy
tealike
notes
flavors
of
toasted
malt
sunflower
seeds
lightly
buttery
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
feel
is
light
almost
lagery
creamy
from
the
carbonation
overall
worth
a
try
but
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
single
from
lukas
in
overland
park
d
depends
on
your
mood
probably
fine
for
at
least
one
im
sure
some
people
could
session
or
dine
on
this
one
fresh
tasting
and
easily
drinkable
what
youd
expect
from
a
german
style
brew

a
little
underwhelming
but
sessionable
good
price
a
nice
easy
flavourful
brew
it
has
some
bockish
and
dunkel
qualities
to
it
would
pair
nicely
with
some
sausage
and
cheese
recommended
as
a
sessionable
thirst
quencher
it
is
definately
an
acceptable
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
i
might
try
this
again
some
time
but
not
immediately
the
aroma
is
really
quite
bad
its
metallic
dusty
malty
and
hoppy
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
large
head
the
flavor
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
with
an
emphasis
on
toasted
malt
grain
husks
and
butterscotch
the
palate
is
average
for
the
style
overall
it
has
good
and
bad
but
the
taste
is
good
mind
you
i
still
order
it
from
time
to
time
for
old
time
sake
or
if
i
dont
like
the
seasonals
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
caramel
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
a
very
minimal
lace
malty
aroma
of
roasted
nuts
and
subtle
hops
nicely
balanced
and
not
as
watered
down
as
most
alt
beers
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
countering
the
slight
hop
flavor
and
a
slight
roasted
nut
flavor
drinkability
this
beats
uerige
which
is
really
saying
something
the
number
one
style
example
that
i
always
used
as
a
benchmark
to
judge
alts
by
has
now
been
beaten
by
an
american
brewer
excellent
job
on
this
one
southampton
and
i
would
love
to
find
more
of
their
beers
here
in
ohio
medium
bodied
smooth
and
very
drinkable
a
nice
winter
brew
i
saw
this
beer
at
tullys
and
bought
it
because
i
had
just
had
a
great
altbier
from
the
portsmouth
brewery
this
one
was
a
pale
imitation
amber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
faint
caramel
aroma
and
faint
caramel
taste
more
of
a
hops
presence
and
the
bitterness
was
on
the
intrusive
side
just
an
ok
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
the
carbonation
is
crisp
this
is
a
nice
departure
from
my
regular
favorites
though
i
doubt
i
will
revisit
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
lighter
carbonation
drinkable
but
again
the
hop
flavor
is
slightly
off
i
know
it
cant
be
old
having
had
it
fresh
from
the
tap
and
felt
similarly
just
seems
out
of
balance
d
secret
ale
is
barely
ok
id
like
to
think
southampton
can
do
better
than
this
but
between
their
lackluster
ipa
and
double
white
i
am
so
far
nonplussed
this
is
frankly
hard
to
recommend
ah
well
so
it
goes
edit
since
i
have
tried
several
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
i
must
conclude
this
bottle
had
external
factors
affecting
it
as
the
other
beers
were
clearly
of
great
quality
and
were
fantastic
however
i
will
keep
my
review
as
i
cannot
ascertain
whether
the
beer
was
affected
through
distribution
or
from
fault
of
the
brewery
no
date
of
when
the
beer
was
bottled
i
havent
had
many
altbiers
but
i
know
this
pales
to
the
wonderful
uerige
doppelsticke
but
its
a
laudable
and
even
enjoyable
stab
at
an
undervalued
german
style
in
a
blindfolded
tastetest
i
may
have
guessed
this
was
actually
from
germany
if
not
for
the
typically
american
toocarbonated
texture
d
come
on
southampton
we
know
you
can
do
better
i
wont
go
for
this
one
again
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
ill
finish
this
one
but
it
wont
be
easy
im
going
back
to
the
store
and
getting
the
other
2
sixpacks
nice
rendition
of
a
classic
german
style
although
mine
is
better
and
cleaner
d
this
would
be
pretty
good
to
session
not
too
sure
of
this
style
but
for
a
fall
seasonal
this
is
not
bad
the
drink
is
nicely
carbonated
with
a
light
medium
body
and
is
quite
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
very
drinkable
altbier
reminds
me
of
long
trails
version
but
with
more
flavor
to
it
this
style
is
definitely
underappreciated
and
again
if
youre
looking
for
an
introduction
to
it
id
recommend
sampling
this
example
d
i
barely
hesitate
to
taste
this
beer
it
is
quaffable
nonoffensive
but
rather
simple
and
bland
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
which
does
leave
some
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
bannana
notes
slight
spices
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
some
spiceyness
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
brew
from
southampton
thanks
joe
overall
not
bad
at
all
but
nothing
really
blowing
me
away
here
by
any
means
not
really
sure
you
could
say
anything
negative
though
a
good
call
in
a
pinch
but
i
do
not
think
i
would
get
it
again
not
enough
complexity
here
for
me
to
be
honest
the
taste
is
not
particularly
sweet
with
musty
malts
slightly
dryish
caramel
notes
pale
malts
some
slight
nutty
and
crisp
lagerish
tones
are
present
as
well
this
is
a
fairly
light
bodied
beer
not
much
creaminess
it
has
a
dry
aftertaste
some
carbonation
but
modest
in
effervesence
there
are
some
tea
like
slightly
acerbic
hop
notes
in
the
finish
overall
the
beer
is
tipped
towards
the
dry
malts
not
a
bad
beer
and
its
a
style
not
as
common
as
one
would
wish
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
damn
solid
beer
i
love
the
brown
pour
with
ruby
highlights
bone
white
head
alts
arent
usually
my
favorite
style
but
i
do
enjoys
them
bready
yeast
flavors
nice
nutty
semi
sweet
malt
body
toffee
mildly
hopped
probably
why
i
dont
frequent
them
i
really
like
a
rich
malty
brew
with
hearty
meals
the
notso
overwealming
mouthfeel
hop
levels
contribute
to
the
favorable
drinkability
factor
yet
i
still
fel
im
drinking
a
substantial
beer
here
not
the
biggest
highest
alcohol
definately
not
the
hoppiest
but
overall
a
great
beer
for
most
occasions
kinda
cool
to
bring
back
a
lesser
known
german
ale
recepie
and
take
it
national
not
a
bad
session
beer
very
good
alt

very
good
d
at

i
could
have
a

of

not
a

and
even

its

dont
think
id
have
more
than
one
maybe
two
strange
bitterness
ccomes
in
late
palate
and
combined
with
weak

the
beer
feels
a

definitely
stick
with

this

more

with

maybe
a

some
good

i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
this
as
i
had
never
sampled
an

i
quite
liked
it
it
was
surprisingly
refreshing
and
filling
at
the

overall

its
no

brought

this
is

im

really

that
i
have
been

and
visited

tried
all
of

probably
has
made
me
a

critical

there

an

at

maltiness

a

drinkable

so
i
notice
something
im
doing
with

brews
and
i
think
its
been
a
little
unfair
of
me
whenever
i
have
a
blue
mountain
kolsch
and
think
about
how
drinkable
it
is
i
realize
that
though
im
mostly
thinking
about
the
beer
itself
im
also
evoking
memories
out
sitting
outside
the
brewery
tasting
room
in
the
shadow
of
the
shenandoah
mountains
in
beautiful
nelson
county
va
gazing
out
over
the
cascade
hop
fields
and
the
neighboring
bucolic
farms
and
vineyards
soaking
up
the
perfect
78
degree
late
august
afternoon
air
as
it
blows
down
skyline
drive
and
the
appalachian
trail
essentially
im
thinking
about
how
perfect
that
beer
is
for
that
time
and
for
that
place
and
how
perfect
that
place
is
and
you
know
what
im
ok
with
that
im
ok
with
rewarding
a
beer
brewed
for
outside
summer
drinking
with
an
enhanced
drinkability
score
because
it
reminds
me
even
when
im
not
drinking
it
outside
during
the
summer
of
how
perfect
it
is
to
drink
it
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
intended
to
be
drank
this
beer
offers
something
similar
to
me
though
with
a
cold
winter
twist
that
is
its
a
rustic
roasty
earthy
brew
traditionally
brewed
and
laid
down
over
the
winter
for
early
new
year
enjoyment
and
i
can
imagine
few
things
nicer
than
sipping
one
on
a
chilly
january
evening
awaiting
tonights
snowstorm
relaxing
with
friends
there
are
few
experiences
i
can
point
that
bring
the
importance
of
drinking
and
eating
for
that
matter
seasonally
and
locally
soapbox
aside
this
is

drinking
brew
taste
is
very
toasty
lightly
caramelly
with
nice
earthyleafy
hop
bitterness
a
bit
peppery
balanced
with
light
sweetness
but
just
dominating
overall
a
mild
subdued
amber
ale
easy
to
drink
no
off
flavors
o
nothing
to
crazy
here
very
easy
drinking
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
an
agreeable
enough
amber
ale
of
the
decidedly
american
bent
the
issue
here
i
propose
is
the
lack
of
actual
german
heritage
or
at
least
a
strict
adherence
to
such
altbiers
have
a
sort
of
crisp
unassuming
nature
to
them
this
approaches
that
but
doesnt
really
follow
through
good
but
not
the
goodest
to
mangle
a
now
stale
colbert
nation
trope
nice
altbier
drinks
like
a
hearty
midseason
brew
technically
an
altbier
i
already
like
this
because
we
need
more
of
these
in
the
usa
however
this
one
is
less
than
stellar
brick
red
with
a
decent
off
white
head
and
decent
carbonation
im
picking
up
aromas
of
dry
red
malt
german
caramel
grains
and
the
aroma
of
a
well
toasted
everything
bagel
the
flavor
is
pleasantly
not
sweet
at
all
the
grains
come
through
a
little
stale
and
there
needs
to
be
some
more
hops
so
balance
things
out
but
the
dryness
and
relative
lack
of
residual
sugar
for
the
style
is
a
welcomed
respite
from
the
droves
of
sugary
reds
out
there
today
a
nice
almost
oaty
smoothness
to
this
but
the
carbonation
dies
a
little
and
the
beer
gets
a
tad
heavy
for
that
reason
the
finish
is
the
best
part
clean
and
dry
but
still
full
of
flavor
exactly
as
the
style
dictates
its
not
a
flawless
alt
by
any
stretch
but
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
american
brewers
now
that
ive
covered
the
basic
mission
lineup
i
think
they
are
a
little
all
over
the
place
but
might
be
on
to
something
with
their
slight
twists
on
mass
appeal
styles
i
will
keep
checking
out
their
beers
as
they
come
in
very
easydrinking
stuff
overall
sessionable
but
forgettable
this
beer
was
decent
thankfully
this
would
make
for
a
good
session
beer
as
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
alcohol
here
and
this
went
down
easily
while
not
the
best
offering
from
mission
this
is
worth
a
go
once
since
more
examples
of
this
style
need
to
be
on
store
shelves
just
dont
look
for
anything
deep
or
fancy
here
glowing
amber
when
held
toward
the
light
a
bit

the
average
amber
labeled

a

as
well
toasted

malts
stand
out
and
really
bring
to
mind
a
good
vienna
style
lager
tastes
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
a
bit
of
harsh
grain
husks
dry
finish
not
enough
malts
shine
through
with
a
bit
of
nutty
earthiness
making
things
pretty
bitter
and
almost
off
putting
so
far
i
can
deal
with
it
but
its
way
to
hopped
up
earthy
dirty
hop
profile
muddles
the
whole
malt
experience
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh

not

i
would

good

enjoyable
brew
im
liking

as
it

up
take
your
time
with
this
one
o
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
this
amber
not
nearly
as
expressive
as
id
like
though
if
i
was
looking
to
crush
a
sixer
i
guess
this
would
do
not
bad
just
not
all
that
great
overall
pretty
good
much
better
than
the
blonde
imo
this
brings
a
nice
malt
profile
with
a
nice
hop
kick
balanced
well
a
dry
not
sticky
finish
with
a
big
bitter
ramp
up
and
light
acidic
bite
that
surprisingly
makes
my
mouth
water
when
the
sip
is
gone
on
tap
at
the
brewerys
skid
row
location
in
san
diego
short
dry
finish
clean
drinking
slightly
creamy
very
smooth
lowmedium
carbonation
nice
but
a
little
bland
very
average
fare
in
my
opinion
comes
off
heavy
handed
in
both
the
malts
and
hops
neither
of
which
were
handled
very
pleasantly
it
was
much
more
drinkable
warm
as
the
plastics
fade
an
affordable
session
beer
if
you
like
esbs
and
medicinal
hops
d
drinkable
just
not
that
exciting
overall
a
good
hoppy
amber
im
told
the
beer
isnt
always
this
hoppy
but
its
damn
enjoyable
o
not
quite
what
i
expected
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
this
came
off
as
an
esb
which
i
am
too
fond
of
that
said
its
got
something
to
offer
and
is
quite
drinkable
but
i
think
id
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
beige
cap
that
was
a
combination
of
fine
and
soapy
bubbles
good
head
retention
with
clumpy
and
streaky
lacing
malty
aroma
not
overly
sweet
though
with
some
toast
and
biscuit
grain
and
faint
herbal
hops
clean
flavour
with
moderate
bitterness
started
out
soft
but
was
sharper
in
the
finish
more
toast
and
biscuit
with
light
caramel
sweetness
slightly
grassy
with
a
hint
of
lemony
citrus
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
a
bit
higher
than
average
a
bit
dry
with
slight
astringency
very
fresh
tasting
and
quite
drinkable
its
nice
to
see
a
someone
take
a
successful
stab
at
a
less
popular
style
a
pretty
good
everyday
beer
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
though
flavor
is
again
clean
and
smooth
albeit
with
a
notable
hop
spice
character
which
delivers
some
unexpected
body
some
nutty
caramel
notes
up
front
segue
to
a
subtle
orange
citrus
character
on
the
finish
and
a
touch
of
smoke
offers
a
touch
of
spice
and
a
moderately
lingering
finish
as
the
pour
warms
nicely
done
and
with
a
well
placed
level
of
carbonation
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
superfoamy
pours
a
bright
crystal
clear
pinkishtoned
copper
coloring
with
an
offwhite
head
that
is
big
bubbled
and
lightly
packed
and
finally
settles
into
about
half
an
inch
slightly
sweet
and
sour
caramel
malt
smells
on
the
nose
the
taste
has
the
same
caramel
characteristics
but
also
a
smokey
tone
that
blends
well
with
the
sweet
flavors
very
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
the
beer
is
dry
and
crisp
and
the
aftertaste
again
has
that
slight
smoked
quality
to
it
very
interesting
the
finish
lingers
a
bit
with
the
caramel
flavors
nothing
really
outstanding
about
this
one
but
nothing
overly
disappointing
either
d
overall
a
good
attempt
but
it
could
use
some
improvement
i
dont
think
ill
be
rushing
to
try
their
other
beers
anytime
soon
a
pretty
tasty

kind

there
is

of

rather
sessionable
d
okay
but
not
great
i
would
not
order
another
or
buy
this
again
not
bad
stuff
overall
but
nothing
memorable
id
like
to
try
some
of
the
brewerys
other
offerings
this
was
decent
a
bit
more
beef
would
have
been
welcome
in
the
body
but
for
the
most
part
this
was
a
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
alt
good
beer
ok
taste
but
mouthfeel
ruined
it
for
me
in
the
end
mission
amber
is
a
respectable
altbier
that
i
probably
wont
think
about
again
once
this
review
is
in
the
books
kudos
to
the
brewery
for
trying
something
different
rather
than
rounding
out
their
lineup
with
yet
another
american
amber
ale
not
sure
if
this
is
really
an
altbier
or
not
my
reference
beer
for
this
beer
type
is
alaskan
amber
and
it
is
frankly
better
than
this
medium
full
body
with
high
drinkability
due
to
the
relatively
low
abv
the
alcohol
is
hidden
in
every
aspect
overall
a
solid
brew
in
a
unique
style
that
i
definetly
recommend
o
easy
drinking
and
malt
forward
for
the
most
part

slightly
crisp
slightly

appropriately
maltdominant
alt
theres
really
not
much
to
say
about
this
somewhat
turbid
orangebrown
beer
its
a
very
solid
very
conventional
alt
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
depth
in
terms
of
character
or
flavor
and
its
even
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
but
it
basically
subscribes
to
the
general
premise
of
alts
its
drinkable
if
a
little
maltdrymostly
toasted
biscuit
and
a
bit
of
nutand
its
hopbitterness
wavers
in
the
wrong
direction
just
a
tadnot
cleansing
as
much
as
it
should
lingering
more
than
it
shouldbut
its
an
altogether
competent
drinkable
brew
good
taste
but
nothing
special
overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
with
a
nice
combination
of
fruits
and
malts
would
like
a
bit
less
sweetness
o
this
beer
is
just
ok
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
go
to
again
overall
another
solid
example
of
the
altbier
style
a
good
choice
when
you
want
something
middleoftheroad
in
terms
of
flavor
complexity
o
why
doesnt
every
brewery
have
an
altbier
seriously
this
is
my
favorite
at
hangar
24
this
beer
is
just
asking
me
to
go
down
to
the
gourmet
pizza
shoppe
order
the
peter
pepperoni
and
sit
back
and
forget
about
how
ive
probably
aged
5
days
in
the
last
24
hours
the
verdict
not
bad
i
met
california
based
hangar
24
at
a
beer
fest
and
they
impressed
me
this
isnt
their
best
but
its
a
decent
sample
of
the
the
style
with
plenty
of
flavor
terrific
altbier
provides
good
flavor
and
complex
for
a
session
beer
stands
out
in
its
own
category
impressive
offering
and
good
value
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
foamy
root
beer
colored

it
barely
has
any
nose
at
all
toasted
malt
aroma
mild
to
medium
bodied
wet
mouthfeel
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
distinct
fresh
chili
pepper
finish
an
interesting
beer
nice
sweet
start
that
brings
up
this
brown
sugar
caramellike
flavor
and
rounds
out
to
a
flavor
reminiscent
of
eating
a
toffee
bar
with
chocolate
and
nuts
very
nice
and
simple
flavors
coming
off
of
this
beer
its
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
its
a
solid
alt
bier
that
id
love
to
have
again
overall
an
ok
beer
not
sure
i
would
buy
again
instead
of
alaskan
amber
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
spectacular
will
keep
giving
hangar
24
a
try
though
looking
for
one
i
like
o
i
had
to
look
up
the
style
to
see
if
it
was
an
ale
or
lager
because
it
has
some
characteristics
of
both
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
and
seemingly
very
wellmade
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
c
overall
a
pretty
good
alt
bier
with
drink
again
next
time
i
go
to
hanger
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
light
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
chunky
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
bready
malt
and
some
slight
fruity
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
nice
herbal
hop
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
carbonation
level
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
alt
beer
with
a
nice
malt
and
herbal
hop
flavor
pours
a
nice
rich
mahogany
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
recedes
into
a
thin
layer
on
the
beer
the
aroma
is
really
nice
lots
of
toasty
bready
notes
balanced
with
some
caramel
sweetness
i
get
some
applepear
fruitiness
on
the
nose
but
again
none
of
it
is
overpowering
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
roast
and
the
sweet
mouthfeel
was
fine
didnt
detract
from
the
beer
but
felt
appropriate
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
well
balanced
beer
it
has
depth
but
is
not
overly
complex
the
flavors
are
sticking
in
my
mouth
and
leaving
me
with
a
really
nice
aftertaste
this
beer
just
keeps
on
giving
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
o
really
to
be
honest
aside
from
their
barrel
roll
series
this
is
the
finest
beer
ive
ever
had
from
hangar
ive
had
multiple
beers
of
theirs
multiple
times
and
frequently
ive
just
kind
of
shrugged
my
shoulders
at
their
offerings
if
i
could
consistently
have
this
beer
in
this
state
every
time
then
id
say
its
one
of
the
finest
unusual
style
beers
served
in
california
my
home
brew
friends
have
raved
about
how
stylistically
on
this
beer
is
so
while
i
dont
know
the
style
i
have
to
say
i
really
am
impressed
with
this
beer
if
you
havent
had
a
hangar
beer
in
a
while
its
worth
paying
a
visit
furthermore
they
deserve
more
ratings
on
these
beer
sites
for
how
well
they
seem
to
sell
locally
nice
amber
color
and
lacing
in
the
tall
pilsener
glass
mild
flavors
with
a
touch
of
the
sweet
and
sour
that
i
associate
with
altbiers
very
light
body
and
the
general
impression
is
a
lager
gone
bad
murky
flavors
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
sprightly
mouthfeel
but
just
a
dirty
aftertaste
with
some
hop
bitterness
slight
beer
smell
i
think
this
one
is
just
not
worth
bothering
with
it
seems
to
detract
from
the
style
there
are
so
many
other
pleasant
beers
with
a
touch
of
malt
like
all
the
ltd
lagers
from
full
sail
a
simple
malty
altbier
some
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
but
not
a
huge
amount
of
character
good
with
a
delicious
burger
o
altbier
can
be
a
catch
all
and
i
think
this
beer
comes
in
to
that
definition
of
alt
the
roast
is
overt
and
much
more
than
youd
expect
from
something
coming
out
of
germany
still
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
a
good
beer
worth
a
pick
up
just
dont
expect
uerige
i
actually
ordered
this
after
trying
it
here
having
it
at
the
underground
in
redlands
on
tap
and
my
craft
beer
friends
enjoyed
the
tastes
they
had
off
my
pint
highly
quaffable
i
wasnt
too
thrilled
with
the
mouthfeel
it
felt
a
bit
thin
and
not
much
carbonation
either
though
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
perhaps
im
just
not
a
fan
of
alts
but
this
was
not
particularly
interesting
to
me
sort
of
bland
all
around
but
i
suppose
it
works
for
some
d
this
could
be
a
session
beer
if
you
like
heavey
malt
flavor
butfor
me
i
need
more
than
just
malt
so
one
is
enough
overall
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
visit
this
style
more
often
altbier
is
a
rare
style
to
find
among
us
microbrewers
so
it
is
nice
to
see
one
done
by
one
of
my
local
ones
more
important
is
it
tastes
good
recommended
d
a
great
brew
goes
great
with
almost
any
food
and
has
enough
character
to
stand
well
on
its
own
the
unique
balance
of
maltiness
and
sweet
hop
bite
will
bring
you
back
for
another
pint
i
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
altbiers
before
but
i
had
to
give
this
new
beer
a
try
from
the
local
brewery
i
am
glad
i
did
because
it
was
the
best
beer
i
had
of
this
style
ben
cook
is
a
great
brewer
and
we
are
starting
to
see
this
more
and
more
i
will
be
drinking
this
each
time
i
go
out
to
visit
friends
in
redlands
now
recommended
a
decent
gulp
with
a
mellow
taste
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
the
bc
liquor
store
in
ladner
enjoyed
a
few
pints
on
tap
at
the
irish
times
pub
in
victoria
bc
a
clear
redbronze
amber
beer
with
an
inch
or
so
of
white
head
nose
is
quite
fruity
almost
evokes
some
banana
along
with
mealy
apples
or
pears
light
molasses
vanilla
soap
and
a
characteristic
noble
hop
floral
note
the
aroma
was
a
tad
estery
for
the
style
but
pleasing
enough
the
style
guidelines
do
translate
quite
well
on
the
palate
this
is
a
crisp
dry
bitter
ale
with
some
citrus
toasted
caramel
and
mineral
notes
very
quenching
and
tart
with
rather
minimal
sweetness
although
i
do
get
a
hint
of
molasses
kiss
candy
or
perhaps
saltwater
taffy
sourish
crab
apple
bitter
orange
peel
herbal
bitters
and
gooseberry
flit
in
and
out
is
that
some
american
hop
in
the
form
of
faint
grapefruit
and
pine
fairly
high
carbonation
and
thin
wellattenuated
body
that
reminds
one
of
a
lager
finishes
quite
clean
with
a
refined
bitterness
and
echoes
of
citrus
and
chalk
really
quite
a
wonderful
alt
even
if
the
nose
threw
me
off
for
a
moment
classic
session
brew
that
drinks
well
but
manages
to
hold
ones
attention
over
the
course
of
several
pints
od
huh
such
a
weak
beer
for
what
i
expected
flavour
wasnt
great
and
the
feel
was
thinner
than
it
shouldve
been
tame
best
describes
this
one
youd
expect
more
hops
for
a
west
coast
take
on
the
style
would
i
buy
it
again
nope
im
surprised
i
expected
to
like
this
more
overall
an
enjoyable
altbier
by
driftwood
there
was
a
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
malts
however
if
there
were
something
else
that
would
give
this
brew
a
little
more
depth
it
would
be
even
better
overall
straightforward
and
good
but
not
as
good
as
parallel
49s
i
think
this
was
a
good
effort
by
driftwood
theyre
local
and
stayed
pretty
true
to
the
style
while
adding
their
own
twist
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
a
little
light
for
some
tastes
but
its
wellmade
that
said
the
criteria
is
is
it
the
worlds
finest
microbrew
amber
ale
no
still
above
average
yes
i
could
see
sharing
this
with
some
of
my
friends
definately
would
buy
again
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
as
far
as
session
beers
go
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
in
the
dark
environment
the
beer
pours
a
deep
brownish
hue
that
seems
clear
with
a
nice
tan
head
toasty
munich
malts
with
a
spicy
aroma
come
across
the
nose
and
the
body
delivers
a
wonderfully
light
malt
body
with
slight
hop
notes
well
put
together
and
subtle
beer
worth
having
again
so
i
ordered
a
second
bottle
to
share
o
interesting
play
of
hops
and
malts
bitter
and
smooth
this
brew
is
a
delicate
well
managed
balance
try
it
with
a
a
hard
goat
cheese
and
some
dried
figs
or
a
stewed
red
meat
o
a
bit
of
a
typical
brown
ale
with
some
german
hints
in
the
hop
certainly
a
full
flavour
profile
but
a
little
lacking
in
malt
and
mouthfeel
poured
into
an
ommegang
flute
pours
a
nice
coppery
orange
amber
minimal
head
leaves
a
persistant
ring
around
the
glass
with
little
lacing
aroma
of
toasty
bready
malt
and
grassy
hops
taste
follows
with
toasty
bready
malt
and
grassy
slightly
pine
hops
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
finishes
with
a
crisp
hop
bite
light
to
medium
bodied
nicely
made
and
refreshing
good
job
in
all
an
awesome
ale
im
glad
i
grabbed
this
one
o
hopheads
would
enjoy
the
bitter
pine
hops
in
this
amber
ale
soso
driftwood
bottle
perhaps
too
mellow
for
me
cloudy
amber
colour
with
lots
of
white
lace
carbonation
right
there
sourish
and
citrus
ok
mouthfeel
passable
drinkability
fresh
bottle
from
store
that
had
a
depth
of
driftwood
beers
on
display
maybe
without
the
acidicity
something
i
could
session
but
i
only
have
a
single
bottle
and
i
need
to
thank
trevor
for
bringing
me
a
box
of
bc
goodies
a
very
clear
copper
with
a
thin
off
white
head
not
alot
on
the
nose
other
than
a
mild
nuttyness
and
some
grainyherbal
scents
some
sweet
malty
flavours
and
again
a
little
nut
and
grass
on
the
finish
light
body
with
a
dry
aftertaste
and
some
good
lacing
driftwood
is
making
better
and
better
beer
all
the
time
their
seasonals
are
fantastic
but
this
is
just
good
not
great
crooked
coast
amber
ale
pours
a
deep
orange
copper
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
warm
toasted
bread
with
some
herbal
hops
the
beer
has
a
great
malty
flavor
without
being
too
sweet
more
bready
lightly
toasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
solid
but
light
to
moderate
hop
bitterness
some
nice
light
spicy
hop
flavor
balances
the
malt
really
nicely
as
a
hop
head
id
looked
past
this
beer
a
lot
previously
but
im
really
glad
i
picked
it
up
d
please
with
the
hop
presence
in
this
amber
well
balanced
and
easy
to
enjoy
d
a
very
tasty
offering
from
driftwood
these
guys
produce
some
solid
beers
and
this
is
another
quality
example
highly
recommended
to
any
fan
of
amber
ales
offering
some
unique
flavours

some
really
nice
piney
citrusy

aromas
emanate
from
the
foamy
head
with
good
hits
of
caramel
cinnamon
clove
and
even
light
touch
of
orangechocolate
taste
is
buttery
and
bready
up
front
with
the
citrusy
hops
coming
in
midsip
resulting
in
a
buttery
and
incredibly
nutty
dry
finish
with
slight
hints
of
apricot
too
fantastically
balanced
complex
and
smooth
mouthfeel
again
is
silky
smooth
with
a
good
amount
of
creaminess
and
displays
a
crisp
dry
spicy
finish
from
the
hops
wow
having
tried
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
i
was
expecting
to
like
this
beer
i
had
no
idea
it
would
be
so
complex
and
wellbalanced
this
is
an
outstanding
ale
from
an
outstanding
brewery
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone

thanks
eric
while
this
is
still
a
decent
beer
i
cant
help
but
be
disappointed
driftwood
is
an
amazing
brewery
but
this
is
my
first
miss
from
them
it
seems
to
be
missing
the
earthiness
from
an
alt
that
helps
balance
out
the
fruit
and
bread
and
i
also
feel
like
it
needed
a
touch
more
hopping
well
worth
a
try
though
cheers
eric
for
the
bottle
d
interesting
but
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
i
wonder
if
it
would
mellow
with
a
little
more
cellaring
mild
cabonation
and
a
smooth
feel
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
meal
fairly
light
body
goes
down
easy
nothing
really
screams
amazing
to
me
and
i
have
grown
to
think
that
of
some
of
drifwoods
brews
but
its
quite
drinkable
and
would
make
for
a
good
summer
switchup
the
flavors
are
quite
unusual
to
my
palate
and
a
bit
challenging
but
i
feel
that
it
is
nice
to
see
an
unusual
style
and
still
have
a
quite
drinkable
beer
just
got
back
from
duesseldorf
and
this
is
very
close
to
all
bier
at
little
hoppy
compared
to
but
darn
near
best
found
let
it
go
a
little
warm
and
flat
and
youd
swear
you
were
in
bar
near
the
rhine
in
d
metro
brews
some
great
german
styles
while
ive
never
been
a
huge
alt
guy
i
do
love
me
some
ironworks
its
malty
sweet
but
with
an
assertive
bitterness
and
dryness
that
keep
things
flowing
the
pints
per
sitting
ratio
is
high
with
this
beer
an
easy
drinker
to
put
away
one
after
the
other
iron
works
alt
is
a
common
occurrence
where
an
american
microbrewery
makes
a
foreign
lands
style
but
does
so
on
their
regular
equipment
with
regular
ale
making
techniques
and
with
as
many
of
the
already
contracted
ingredients
that
they
can
reasonably
get
away
with
although
it
has
glimpses
of
northern
german
alts
its
not
a
classic
or
authentic
flavor
or
feel
it
does
make
for
a
fairly
good
and
clean
nondescript
ale
beer
is
mediumlight
to
medium
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumhigh
to
high
in
intensity
resulting
in
a
fairly
fizzy
mouthfeel
thats
a
bit
too
pronounced
for
the
bodys
weight
the
result
is
a
prickly
feel
that
takes
more
than
a
few
seconds
to
dissipate
eventually
settling
to
a
gentle
foam
on
the
palate
closes
fairly
dry
with
subtantial
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
o
i
think
if
it
wasnt
for
the
apple
like
flavor
im
getting
possibly
the
yeast
i
would
have
rated
this
much
higher
ive
not
had
many
alts
but
this
one
fell
short
of
expectations
its
in
a
stange
just
sitting
there
staring
at
me
like
im
some
crazy
beer
knurdand
its
got
a
beautiful
semidark
copper
color
that
just
gets
darker
towards
its
center
its
mildly
hazy
and
filled
with
some
good
carbonation
the
head
is
thick
and
fluffy
and
just
will
not
go
away
did
i
mention
that
its
in
an
off
white
color
maybe
even
tan
medium
lacing
nothing
else
to
say
here
weak
fruit
aromas
like
apple
banana
raisins
and
mild
malts
crisp
and
sharp
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
it
mellows
out
into
a
slightly
tangy
beer
over
all
the
malts
are
well
represented
here
herbs
and
mild
citrus
fruits
also
come
through
very
interesting
taste
it
warms
up
in
the
aftertaste
and
the
tanginess
wanes
just
a
bit
as
well
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
oim
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
was
enjoyable
will
definitely
try
the
style
again
metropolitan
iron
works
alt
35
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
over
memorial
day
weekend
at
the
binnys
behind
goose
island
clybourn
served
in
a
pint
glass
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
nose
has
some
bready
malt
and
a
touch
of
nuttiness
some
herbal
hops
flavor
is
similar
but
has
a
metallic
twang
through
the
finish
the
same
appears
in
the
nose
as
it
warms
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
dry
finish
not
a
big
fan
overall
it
isnt
terrible
but
i
grew
tired
of
it
quickly
and
did
not
finish
the
bottle
o
wasnt
impressed
but
didnt
feel
like
it
was
a
bad
beer
felt
like
metropolitan
rounded
out
their
portfolio
nice
to
try
but
if
you
are
a
diehard
altbier
fan
id
pass
o
to
me
it
seems
like
metropolitan
went
for
an
easy
drinking
different
lager
rather
than
make
a
true
altbier
displays
an
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
a
bit
of
toffee
caramel
and
grassy
herbal
hops
dominate
the
nose
starts
smooth
with
notes
of
caramel
notes
of
apple
and
pear
join
in
the
midpalate
and
finishes
somewhat
dry
and
clean
a
very
tasty
locallybrewed
altbier
an
easydrinking
yet
complex
beer
for
almost
any
occassion
nice
and
hoppy
surprisingly
so
for
an
alt
a
great
balance
between
hops
and
malts
and
a
great
beer
to
transition
or
turn
someone
to
alts
seriously
this
is
a
great
beer
to
wean
people
who
have
been
suckling
on
ipas
for
too
long
o
a
complex
lager
for
sure
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
one
but
i
am
having
trouble
with
the
metallic
taste
finally
sitting
down
to
try
what
comes
across
as
the
highestregarded
of
the
metropolitan
beers
which
for
whatever
reason
ive
sorta
neglected
over
the
years
it
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
belgian
candi
sugar
lightly
spicy
greens
mandarin
orange
syrup
and
a
touch
of
red
apple
skin
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
candi
sugar
really
taking
on
a
leadership
role
now
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
one
of
the
better
altbiers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
pretty
darn
drinkable
o
complex
traditional
fresh
overall
quite
really
nice
another
great
beer
from
metro
i
get
the
octogenarian
part
as
this
is
a
smooth
and
mellow
beer
but
im
not
so
sure
it
has
a
punk
rock
attitude
i
found
it
totally
pleasant
without
any
harshness
at
all
the
flavor
also
tapers
to
a
soft
sweet
finish
that
reminded
me
of
a
bock
this
is
a
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
beer
that
id
be
happy
to
offer
to
guests
it
would
also
in
my
estimation
be
a
great
gateway
beer
if
youre
trying
to
get
a
macro
fan
to
try
some
craft
beer
its
straightforward
enough
yet
very
subtle
and
intriguing
personality
that
makes
your
points
obvious
is
my
palate
broken
tonight
grab
a
bottle
and
find
out
d
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
alt
has
all
the
great
sweet
malt
characteristics
while
still
being
dry
enough
to
have
several
in
one
sitting
overall
one
of
the
better
alts
that
i
have
had
nice
complex
aroma
and
taste
this
is
really
good
the
feel
is
very
good
though
the
taste
is
lacking
a
slight
bit
this
is
a
real
enjoyable
beer
on
the
whole
3

this
is
seriously
easy
to
drink
it
has
enough
facets
to
keep
you
engaged
well
done
guys
o
actually
not
a
bad
beer
after
looking
over
some
of
the
reviews
i
get
the
feeling
this
might
be
considerably
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
easy
to
drink
this
review
may
not
be
perfect
because
i
drank
this
sucker
straight
from
the
bottle
i
cant
speak
much
of
the
appearance
since
its
behind
a
brown
bottle
nor
the
smell
since
its
only
being
channeled
out
the
end
of
a
narrow
bottle
however
this
is
one
tasty
beer
it
comes
across
to
me
as
almost
a
newcastle
brown
ale
clone
although
it
is
not
a
brown
ale
real
smooth
drinker
i
could
definitely
put
a
handful
of
these
back
in
short
order
would
recommend
dthis
one
is
quite
a
bit
hoppier
than
im
used
to
for
an
alt
but
its
still
a
very
solid
beer
o
this
isnt
a
style
i
usually
choose
or
one
that
im
overly
familiar
with
it
was
an
enjoyable
offering
from
a
local
brewery
ill
check
this
one
out
again
not
my
among
my
top
3
altbiers
but
still
a
good
quality
brew
perfect
for
tossing
back
a
few
on
a
summer
afternoon
overall
this
is
nice
not
a
beer
id
drink
very
often
but
not
a
beer
ill
pass
up
if
its
offered
i
love
metropolitan
especially
krankshaft
this
is
another
of
their
wellmade
beers
amber
with
lots
of
visisble
carbonation
and
amazing
clarity
a
big
three
inch
fluffy
white
pilow
head
on
top
faded
quickly
leaving
behind
just
a
hint
of
lace
the
aroma
was
very
malty
lots
of
cereal
and
bread
smells
along
with
a
touch
of
banana
the
flavor
was
light
and
very
good
lots
of
grains
and
bready
like
flavors
bit
very
nice
balance
with
a
touch
of
banana
of
pear
like
fruit
and
a
hint
of
spice
as
well
a
nice
strong
finish
left
the
mouth
ddry
and
begging
for
another
sip
the
carbonation
was
great
and
mixed
with
a
smooth
subtle
feel
made
this
extremmely
drinkable
overall
a
very
nice
offering
and
definitly
a
quality
session
beer
i
would
look
forward
to
trying
this
one
again
in
the
future
o
the
nice
clean
crisp
alt
has
a
very
fresh
malt
flavor
with
some
good
depth
to
the
toasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
darker
malt
comes
through
as
another
subtle
layer
this
is
well
lagered
with
a
nice
hop
snap
to
finish
the
taste
pours
a
dark
orange
with
some
copper
in
the
center
a
light
tope
head
provides
some
great
sponge
pattern
lace
to
observe
nose
is
tough
pungent
caramel
wet
hops
and
a
bit
skunky
not
a
fan
of
this
at
all
taste
is
a
bit
better
as
the
sweet
toffee
notes
are
more
tolerable
but
still
a
wet
grain
bitter
skunk
finish
not
my
thing
o
i
admit
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
kick
as
the
label
claimed
assertively
hoppy
giving
the
beer
good
balance
hints
of
caramel

i
would
go
back
to
this
alt
as
a
change
from
the
far
too
oft
brown
ales
that
rest
in
the
pits
of
faux
britannia
basementberapr
11
crumpets
and
a
touch
of
hop
bite
nice
hop
bitterness
plays
with
bitterness
from
the
roast
in
the
malts
to
create
a
dark
toasty
puckering
brew
with
a
beautiful
sticky
head
and
lacing
some
toasty
grains
and
husks
are
present
as
well
amid
a
subtle
but
warm
earthy
backdrop
medium
light
body
surprises
the
senses
dry
finish
pretty
easy
drinker
and
i
love
the
swing
tops
their
beers
come
in
worth
more
purchases
grainy
sweet
bready
malt
and
light
fruit
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
style
dry
easy
finish
for
a
simple
but
wellcrafted
beer
that
will
please
your
sweet
tooth
but
has
just
enough
balance
to
not
tire
you
out
great
swing
top
bottle
overall
definitely
something
different
as
far
as
altbier
goes
sticke
is
certainly
out
of
the
box
more
like
a
doppelbock
than
a
kolsch
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
are
looking
for
something
big
and
different
but
still
balanced
d
this
is
my
first
alt
but
definitely
enjoyed
it
easy
drinking
i
honestly
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
with
this
one
i
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
so
my
expectations
were
lowabsent
what
i
came
away
with
was
a
very
intriguing
brew
complex
and
musty
and
quite
enjoyable
very
glad
i
stumbled
across
this
one
the
best
of
this
style
that
ive
tried
though
i
have
not
tried
many
a
very
pleasing
alt
something
i
will
buy
again
this
beer
is
pristine
and
wonderful
it
is
brewed
with
care
and
expertly
in
accord
with
the
purity
laws
of
1516
a
masterpiece
waiting
to
delight
you
with
its
malt
richness
with
the
bounty
of
the
hop
flowerclean
and
crisp
as
much
from
malt
as
from
carbonation
excellent
probably
my
all
time
favorite
alt
uerige
sticke
has
just
a
little
more
complexity
than
the
other
nearly
equally
fine
examples
from
uerige
this
pours
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
but
thats
about
it
it
has
a
very
interesting
malt
flavor
to
it
there
are
hints
of
caramel
as
well
as
a
little
sourness
lot
of
unique
hard
to
describe
flavors
to
describe
but
interesting
nevertheless
o
delicious
i
would
get
this
again
quite
tasty
enjoyable
and
drinkable
awesome
sweet
and
rich
but
with
a
sweeping
dryness
spicy
hops
really
showed
up
to
combat
the
deep
dark
bready
malts
i
loved
the
sweet
nutty
caramel
malt
seemed
sweet
but
actually
was
not
almost
like
tricking
your
brain
great
layering
effects
and
a
standout
brew
for
sure
ill
admit
of
all
the
beers
i
have
had
over
the
years
traditional
german
altbiers
are
not
my
strong
point
i
tend
to
skew
towards
domestics
and
altbiers
are
one
of
the
few
styles
that
do
not
seem
to
be
prevalent
in
my
area
so
in
order
to
review
this
beer
i
cant
really
compare
it
to
other
altbiers
off
the
top
of
my
head
but
overall
uerige
sticke
stands
its
ground
as
a
solid
ale
unlike
other
brown
ales
this
altbier
isnt
overcome
with
molasses
and
caramel
flavors
this
has
a
more
fruity
flavor
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
when
poured
the
head
is
lush
and
when
you
take
a
sip
the
suds
stick
to
the
liquid
giving
a
generous
aerated
sipping
quality
that
is
quite
refreshing
after
you
swish
around
the
lovely
flavor
and
swallow
the
aftertaste
maintains
the
essence
of
the
beer
itself
with
no
degradaton
a
very
tasty
experience
o
a
very
weird
beer
certainly
different
from
what
you
expect
from
an
altbier
delicious
worth
the
price
tag
great
beer
i
just
found
grace
in
altbiers
just
after
dinking
the
uerige
flavorful
hoppy
with
good
drinkability
o
altbiers
are
a
classic
beers
that
you
drink
with
ease
like
all
germans
but
in
that
case
with
their
own
flavours
and
peculiarities
this
one
is
the
perfect
representation
of
the
style
great
drinkabilty
complexity
and
balance
o
my
first
proper
german
alt
and
i
was
blown
away
touched
on
some
of
the
same
things
i
love
about
scotch
ales
im
sure
there
are
plenty
other
great
ones
out
there
but
there
arent
a
whole
lot
available
from
what
i
could
see
and
the
couple
american
versions
ive
had
were
much
more
like
standard
american
amber
ales
ill
definitely
be
seeking
out
more
like
this
and
would
get
this
one
again
in
a
heartbeat
overall
a
higher
alchol
version
of
the
original
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
o
i
havent
had
many
altbiers
so
i
wasnt
exactly
sure
what
to
expect
i
would
describe
it
as
a
moderatelyhoppy
brown
ale
well
constructed
and
balanced
id
also
like
to
try
this
again
with
less
age
on
it
o
tasty
but
i
preferred
the
sticke
version
o
i
did
not
much
enjoy
this
beer
not
recommended
id
be
open
to
trying
a
younger
bottle
far
in
the
future
though
theres
a
reason
english
ales
not
german
beers
have
inspired
the
craft
brew
revolution
i
wish
these
guys
would
do
more
with
the
little
piece
of
history
theyve
got
this
is
a
surprisingly
easy
going
beer
which
could
pair
well
with
lunch
or
a
relaxing
afternoon
o
after
visiting
dusseldorf
about
2
years
ago
i
became
a
huge
fan
of
altbier
i
really
enjoy
most
of
the
german
offerings
i
have
had
though
the
experience
in
dusseldorf
makes
it
so
mush
more
enjoyable
fresh
from
the
casks
and
with
the
waiters
walking
around
with
continuous
fresh
glasses
marking
the
coaster
to
indicate
how
many
you
consumed
this
beer
is
highly
sessionable
and
quite
enjoyable
the
flavors
complement
fallwinter
foods
really
well
the
body
was
a
little
lighter
than
expected
but
still
good
the
beer
was
nicely
carbonated
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
can
appreciate
overall
i
was
staidly
dissapointed
with
this
compared
to
the
doppel
stickle
version
from
this
brewery
aromas
were
quite
inviting
albeit
mellow
but
the
flavor
profile
was
just
flat
like
the
brewer
forgot
an
ingredient
or
something
not
something
i
plan
to
revisit
and
not
recommended
search
out
the
purple
label
pass
on
this
lighter
watered
down
version
not
literally
but
thats
how
it
tastes
poured
a
deep
orange
brown
darker
than
the
classic
altbier
still
an
offwhite
head
nonetheless
a
think
collar
some
spotty
lace
and
a
thin
film
of
retention
nose
is
much
hoppier
than
the
classic
altbier
with
only
a
fraction
of
the
dark
fruit
notes
more
more
bread
spicy
and
herbal
hop
notes
taste
still
has
a
bit
of
the
fruit
as
well
but
still
less
prominent
than
the
classic
a
bit
of
bread
and
spicy
herbal
german
hop
notes
lengthy
bitter
and
drying
finish
medium
feel
and
low
carbonation
more
bitter
than
the
classic
altbier
and
a
tad
more
enjoyable
body
is
decidedly
medium
with
a
high
enough
level
of
carbonation
to
let
itself
be
felt
but
not
painful
dry
throughout
maybe
from
tannins
which
could
explain
the
constant
bitter
cacao
aromas
and
tastes
i
was
picking
up
on
result
is
a
fairly
crisp
beer
thats
very
dry
in
the
finish
ueridge
sticke
is
quite
a
good
altbier
its
good
enough
that
i
will
probably
try
their
other
offerings
which
are
almost
all
alts
overall
its
a
quality
beer
that
everyone
should
appreciate
just
lighter
than
mid
bodied
nicely
carbonated
drinks
well
the
slightly
more
sessionable
version
of
the
dopple
sticke
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nothing
to
crazy
jumping
out
at
you
which
on
most
days
is
very
enjoyable
would
buy
again
really
nice
packaging
as
well
will
reuse
the
bottle
for
sure
d
fantastically
flavorful
and
drinkable
this
is
my
first
alt
reviewed
and
it
is
interesting
to
think
this
is
the
slightly
beefier
version
from
uerige
it
would
be
neat
to
try
the
classic
sticke
and
doppel
side
by
side
overall
very
enjoyable
brew

at

in

dark

finish
is

and
lightly

some

nice
hoppy
aroma
but
flavor
lacks
the
hoppyness
quite
a
lot
of
sweet
malty
alcohol
in
the
flavorfinish
i
picked
this
up
randomly
knowing
nothing
about
what
was
in
the
bottle
and
i
was
rather
pleased
loads
of
complexity
for
the
lighter
alcohol
overall
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
but
you
can
definitely
taste
the
tradition
and
nationality
of
the
style
its
really
the
type
of
beer
id
love
to
have
at
a
festival
in
the
beers
home
city
overall
alright
but
i
prefer
their
doppel
more
enjoyable
could
have
again
no
problem
good
and
interesting
kind
of
light
and
refreshing
but
with
some
flavors
that
would
be
more
expected
in
a
heavy
malty
beer
i
like
it
in
its
imported
bottle
but
it
tastes
to
me
like
it
would
be
really
fantastic
to
have
fresh
pours
a
fairlyhazy
dark
tawnymahogany
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
lasts
for
awhile
and
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
brings
forward
a
good
amount
of
bread
crust
and
some
earthy
hops
dry
malt
and
a
slight
bit
of
roast
the
flavor
brings
some
light
malty
toasted
character
and
some
bread
crust
along
with
that
theres
some
earthy
hops
and
an
accompanying
dryness
light
caramel
character
in
there
as
it
warms
more
though
the
earthy
hops
really
begin
to
take
over
especially
with
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
body
and
lighter
carbonation
really
nice
example
of
the
style
this
brew
poured
out
a
bit
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
the
color
was
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
head
on
top
the
smell
of
this
beer
to
me
was
giving
me
the
thoughts
of
grape
wine
the
taste
had
some
good
malt
flavors
in
there
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
and
light
overall
this
beer
was
interesting
in
it
own
way
i
liked
it
enough
to
try
it
again
one
day
o
a
great
beer
represents
the
style
very
well
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
as
its
one
of
the
few
altbiers
you
can
easily
get
a
hold
of
in
the
states
this
is
an
enjoyable
amber
ale
and
the
hops
and
bitterness
make
it
interesting
oa
very
nice
altbier
worth
trying
poured
from
bottle
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
disappeared
nice
copper
color
with
a
sweet
malt
syrup
aroma
taste
is
sweet
with
a
dry
peppery
finish
not
very
bitter
the
malt
flavor
is
dominant
right
up
front
a
nice
beer
very
unique
bottle
worth
a
second
round
nice
beer
and
a
unique
style
d
the
uerige
alts
are
definitely
have
more
of
a
hop
presence
and
the
sticke
is
no
different
delicious
and
moreish
o
altbiers
are
delicious
i
have
to
compare
this
to
another
bottle
with
a
different
code
overall
i
love
this
beer
this
version
bring
just
that
extra
touch
of
robustness
to
the
style
that
makes
it
a
beer
that
is
both
satisfying
and
complex
worthy
of
the
price
it
carries
compared
to
other
domestic
craft
altbiers
on
the
takehome
scale
i
would
rate
this
as
a
six
pack
not
your
everyday
beer
unless
you
are
a
german
beer
kinda
person
i
dont
know
how
to
spell
this
comes
into
the
glass
a
nice
bark
brown
with
some
faded
orange
towards
the
side
a
nice
amount
of
cream
colored
foam
about
an
inch
up
leaves
no
stick
on
the
glass
smell
is
fruity
apple
a
nice
caramel
scent
and
thats
about
it
its
an
alt
taste
is
very
fruity
but
tamer
than
a
bsda
which
this
reminds
me
of
only
extremely
lighter
never
had
a
alt
this
fruity
thats
all
caramel
comes
up
too
with
a
faint
earthy
hop
in
the
middle
no
trace
of
the
6
feel
is
medium
carb
is
there
but
not
felt
under
the
body
i
could
drink
a
shit
ton
of
this
and
like
it
one
of
the
better
german
beers
ive
had
glad
i
scooped
it
up
well
worth
it
i
went
to
das
bierhaus
in
btown
and
some
cool
guy
i
made
friends
with
bought
me
one
of
these
for
the
first
time
out
of
the
fliptop
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
copperbrown
color
with
one
finger
of
head
the
retention
was
good
and
the
lacing
consistent
down
my
glass
the
aroma
was
a
complex
mix
of
malts
caramel
rum
some
wood
and
nuts
as
well
as
some
golden
raisin
the
flavors
were
not
quite
as
pronounced
as
the
aroma
for
me
but
the
balance
was
ideal
caramel
burnt
caramel
nuts
earth
and
then
a
kick
of
piney
hops
to
finish
it
very
very
drinkable
assuaged
by
the
quick
clean
finish
of
an
otherwise
very
malty
beer
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
average
as
well
which
also
encouraged
quaffing
impresive
overall
this
was
a
simple
yet
very
good
beer
and
one
that
to
me
seems
like
a
standardbearer
for
the
style
well
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around

tasting
brew
that
is
not
all
that
strong
in
alcohol
probably
the
standardbearer
for
this
brew
as
the
dopplesticke
is
a
lot
different
and
stronger
more
akin
to
a
barley
wine
d
is
good
with
balanced
flavors
and
a
nice
change
to
try
a
new
style
although
price
is
a
tad
high
for
a
11

bottle
about

dominant
aroma
of
noble
hops
predominantly
floral
and
spicy

of

good

not

the

pours
a
light
brown
that
turns
to
brown
as
you
go
up
the
glass
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
remained
throughout
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
grain
and
subtle
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
malt
grain
citrus
spices
and
subtle
caramel
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
it
was
amazingly
smoother
than
i
thought
it
would
be
by
the
appearance
had
a
very
nice
balanced
and
complex
flavor
to
go
along
with
it
definitely
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
rich
its
very
sharp
an
creamy
and
really
drinkable
its
got
a
nice
creamy
taste
its
a
very
solid
beer
d
can
session
plenty
of
these
a
delicious
brew
on
tap
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
served
in
a
0
2l
uerige
glass
burnished
copper
with
pale
amber
highlights
hazy
toward
the
center
highly
effervescent
with
outstanding
head
retention
and
lacing
this
looks
pretty
inviting
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
depth
opening
with
berrylike
fruitiness
leafy
and
earthy
hops
toasted
malt
as
it
warms
i
can
pick
out
subtle
notes
of
mineral
and
soil
the
palate
shares
the
same
berrylike
character
that
i
detect
in
the
aroma
but
its
also
aggressively
hoppy
malty
lightly
toasted
but
quite
dry
hops
take
over
midpalate
and
leave
a
lingering
bitterness
that
suggests
citrus
rind
bitter
herbs
earth
and
minerals
its
hard
to
wrap
my
mind
around
this
beer
but
i
enjoy
it
more
each
time
i
try
it
impression
when
this
is
available
next
i
am
getting
a
case
suggest
you
do
the
same
only
issue
i
had
with
this
is
i
felt
it
was
over
carbed
which
removed
some
of
the
deep
maltiness
i
really
like
in
stickes
decent
beer
however
d
one
of
the
classics
of
the
style
and
quite
an
nice
beer
for
my
palate
overall
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
were
it
not
for
the
label
i
would
have
pegged
it
as
a
slightly
strong
english
brown
ale
by
appearance
and
flavor
this
bottle
was
a
gusher
probably
due
to
mishandling
so
i
will
try
to
seek
out
another
and
update
my
review
very
very
drinkable
and
pleased
ive
at
last
had
one
of
these
famous
beers
ive
drank
at
the
brewhouse
a
few
times
but
many
years
ago
and
sadly
never
when
the
stike
was
on
this
was
a
great
beer
great
amber
almost
cherry
wood
color
to
the
beer
had
a
great
head
in
the
beginning
but
quickly
faded
to
a
thin
film
lacing
was
very
evident
and
great
throughout
taste
was
perfect
for
an
alt
with
little
alcohol
flavor
would
want
many
more
drinkability
solid
beer
and
it
was
cool
to
try
a
beer
like
that
on
tap
thanks
kb
d
drinkable
and
well
made
this
is
a
simple
and
sessionable
brew
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
but
not
at
the
import
prices
that
one
tends
to
find
them
at
a
good
beer
but
probably
best
in
dusseldorf
i
wasnt
as
wowed
with
this
as
i
hoped
i
would
be
for
a
german
top
25
beer
but
it
is
a
nice
drinker
and
id
be
happy
to
have
a
few
more
d
a
decent
drinker
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
thick
head
last
for
a
moment
before
fading
into
a
thin
sheet
of
foam
aroma
is
of
raisins
mainly
with
some
other
dark
fruit
aromas
and
sweet
malts
tongue
is
thoroughly
coated
with
the
sticky
flavors
of
this
wonderful
brew
taste
is
also
mainly
raisins
some
hops
and
sweet
malts
upon
warming
a
really
tasty
treat
an
obvious
perfect
interpretation
of
the
altbier
style
with
no
alcohol
noted
upon
tasting
whatsoever
the
flavor
is
of
toasted
malts
baked
bread
a
slight
spiciness
a
low
level
of
bitterness
walnuts
and
almonds
chocolate
is
noticeable
but
subtle
and
theres
a
dash
of
sweetness
midpalate
that
is
quickly
consumed
the
dry
finish
is
of
baked
bread
toasted
malt
and
a
dash
of
chocolate
the
carbonation
is
high
and
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
a
delicious
and
drinkable
german
beer
feel
is
good
solid
but
not
oily
this
beer
opens
with
a
loud
pop
and
pours
a
cloudy
mahogany
color
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
with
good
retention
aromas
of
caramel
and
stone
fruit
with
a
hint
of
spice
malty
caramel
and
biscuit
flavors
raisin
and
a
little
smoke
there
is
a
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
body
and
carbonation
well
balanced
easy
drinking
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
in
one
session
without
getting
bored
or
overpowered
in
any
way
beer
is
medium
bodied
i
dont
know
why
i
was
expecting
a
thinner
beer
but
i
know
when
im
wrong
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
drinkability
is
high
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
other
beeradvocates
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
hard
to
find
and
expensive
in
the
states
brownish
amber
with
a
gorgeous
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lace
holding
it
against
the
light
reveals
reddish
amber
highlights
the
nose
is
excellent
mildly
nutty
and
malty
with
mild
brown
sugar
what
strikes
me
though
is
the
hop
character
its
just
so
fresh
earthy
and
mildly
lemonlike
in
character
with
a
touch
of
freshcut
grass
deep
caramel
malt
character
is
present
with
honey
contrasting
well
against
the
hops
on
the
palate
it
opens
with
a
firm
hop
bitterness
very
grassy
in
nature
surprisingly
bitter
malt
character
is
deep
with
mild
brown
sugar
honey
and
jaggery
while
remaining
very
light
on
the
palate
finishes
dry
and
bitter
with
a
mild
sweetness
carbonation
is
moderate
and
more
than
ample
theres
so
much
flavor
in
such
a
low
abv
beer
this
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
mfd
for
a
beer
that
is
to
have
a
medium
body
i
think
this
one
is
a
bit
too
light
carbonation
is
moderate
but
serves
nothing
to
enhance
the
size
of
the
body
either
way
the
drinkability
is
superb
could
have
many
more
rounds
of
this
guy
d
excellent
beer
in
its
class
enough
to
differentiate
it
from
other
german
brews
but
stays
true
and
pure
a
decent
example
of
the
style
that
is
authentic
and
easy
to
drink
no
hop
or
malt
overload
here
just
plain
good
ol
altbier
check
it
out
bjcp
suggests
this
be
entered
as
a
specialty
ale
but
it
isnt
particularly
special
really
a
bit
more
assertive
and
complex
than
a
regular
altbier
but
only
just
i
may
revise
this
review
if
i
find
a
fresher
bottle
looking
forward
to
comparing
to
the
doppelsticke
next
had
a
goblet
for
7
at
sunswick
3535
in
astoria
definitely
an
interesting
beer
it
was
fruity
but
clean
like
more
german
ale
none
of
that
belgian
spice
it
started
with
a
beery
mix
of
cherry
strawberry
and
date
followed
by
dry
lightly
roasted
malts
and
a
grassy
hop
finish
quite
a
nice
beer
drinkable
and
good
change
of
pace
give
it
a
try
really
more
like
a
bock
than
an
alt
color
is
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
small
beige
head
aroma
was
slighly
sherry
llike
with
big
raisen
notes
flavor
was
very
sweet
with
malt
caramel
and
more
raisins
not
crisp
and
bitter
like
an
altr
is
supposed
to
be
but
then
again
it
really
is
miscatorgorized
as
an
alt
had
medium
carbonation
and
body
a
nice
beer
but
not
an
alt
pour
is
copper
with
a
bit
of
a
hazy
to
it
rather
small
head
of
an
off
white
color
smell
is
mild
and
crisp
but
complex
apples
caramel
smoked
malt
and
some
chocolate
the
taste
has
all
those
well
blended
and
smooth
with
a
nice
but
not
overpowering
caramel
note
with
a
smokeiness
on
the
side
of
mild
acidic
very
light
leather
finish
mild
bitter
really
fantastic
not
a
dense
sweet
and
not
heavy
on
the
stomach
at
all
will
definitely
have
many
times
to
come
this
beer
pours
a
murky
amberbrown
color
the
head
is
a
firm
inch
of
foam
that
just
sits
there
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
hints
of
spice
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
fruitier
spicier
and
more
bitter
than
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
altbier
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
this
is
such
an
easy
and
great
beer
this
is
an
every
day
sipper
no
matter
what
season
rather
low
abv
in
general
so
this
is
great
d
i
found
myself
really
sipping
and
savoring
this
beer
it
may
have
been
because
i
had
such
a
small
pour
and
i
wanted
to
explore
it
or
i
was
just
enjoying
it
that
much
it
absolutely
wasnt
because
it
was
difficult
to
drink
this
is
a
mighty
smooth
beer
and
it
really
challenges
the
palate
in
a
good
way
lots
of
things
going
on
in
here
and
this
was
an
absolutely
great
experience
i
look
forward
to
exploring
this
brewerys
other
offerings
and
just
exploring
alts
in
general
quite
drinkable
very
nice
but
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
i
prefer
the
uerige
standard
over
this
special
version
but
both
are
quite
good
this
is
nothing
like
what
i
thought
it
would
be
but
i
was
really
surprised
really
glad
that
i
picked
one
of
these
beers
up
this
is
a
great
altbier
wish
more
american
breweries
tried
this
style
the
uerige
sticke
would
be
a
good
one
to
emulate
d
very
drinkable
medium
abv
nice
flavor
refreshing
excellent
german
session
brew
wish
we
got
more
altbiers
o
an
interesting
beer
i
had
never
tried
the
style
and
since
my
company
is
based
in
dusseldorf
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
surprised
by
the
hop
bitterness
but
not
a
bad
beer
interesting
bottle
to
say
the
least
very
decent
especially
with
a
little
warmth
on
it
nothing
i
seek
out
every
day
the
style
in
general
but
not
a
bad
example
at
all
drinkability
barley
flavor
is
too
overwhelming
and
alcohol
asserts
itself
too
much
to
make
this
too
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
some
nice
carbonation
sweet

im
presuming
consumed
4708
the
website
labels
it
as
6
5
and
says
that
its
dryhopped
in
the
maturation
tanks
the
beer
is
a
highlysedimented
medium
copper
with
ample
carbonation
topped
with
a
twofinger
tannish
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
creamy
cover
leaving
tons
of
lacing
on
the
glass
very
earthy
in
the
nose
with
perfumygreen
hops
and
a
roasted
malt
backing
nice
roasted
and
caramel
malts
on
the
palate
a
little
chewy
with
a
complex
fairly
bitter
hop
profile
that
contributes
perfumyfloralleafy
notes
and
lots
of
lingering
oils
it
has
a
wellcarbonated
medium
body
that
imparts
a
dry
fairly
long
finish
i
love
these
hoppy
and
malty
sticke
alts
delicious
interesting
and
unique
and
uerige
makes
the
best
stickes
ive
come
across
i
will
always
gladly
come
back
for
another
one
im
damn
impressed
with
uerige
sticke
its
my
first
experience
with
the
beer
and
its
left
a
lasting
impression
the
nose
could
use
a
tad
more
strength
but
otherwise
its
very
impressive
theres
a
ton
of
flavor
crammed
into
this
bottle
and
its
well
worth
the
experience
definitely
one
to
check
out
the
look
of
the
beer
is
brownishamber
almost
carmel
color
vary
hazy
that
gives
it
a
thick
look
frothy
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
fairly
fast
i
could
smell
that
fruity
goodness
when
my
glass
was
put
on
the
table
once
i
stuck
my
nose
in
the
glass
i
was
hit
with
lots
of
sweet
malt
aroma
the
fragrance
of
this
beer
is
pleasurable
taste
is
malt
right
up
front
balanced
nicely
by
hops
i
would
call
this
is
an
easy
smooth
drinking
beer
and
would
use
the
word
mild
but
that
would
not
do
it
justice
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
a
crisp
finish
once
again
the
hop
and
malt
balance
is
almost
perfect
good
lacing
down
the
glass
i
am
defiantly
recommending
this
beer
to
everybody
if
you
can
find
it
order
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
dgreat
german
alt
no
off
import
flavors
great
representation
of
the
style
too
bad
more
german
altbiers
are
so
hard
to
find
around
here
ive
enjoyed
the
real
alts
ive
had
but
i
cant
say
im
an
expert
on
the
style
there
dosent
seem
to
be
many
german
alts
available
and
im
not
sure
the
micros
are
true
to
form
of
course
i
liked
it
d
i
can
see
how
this
is
considered
the
classic
example
of
the
style
by
people
really
easy
to
drink
overall
goes
down
smoothly
mouth
is
left
slightly
numb
by
the
active
carbonation
and
the
generally
strong
taste
i
was
expecting
a
sweeter
taste
though
judging
by
the
smell
very
interesting
beer
and
one
of
my
top
rated
active
bottled
beers
for
the
altbier
style
into
a
stange
it
goes
the
beer
is
murky
brown
with
hues
of
a
faded
orange
and
tan
glow
not
particularly
pretty
but
this
is
expected
for
the
style
solid
head
retention
super
sweet
in
the
nose
very
malty
sweet
with
a
kick
of
hop
leaf
taste
it
doesnt
jump
out
on
you
its
more
powdery
somewhat
hoppy
with
a
burnt
bread
crust
flavor
its
nutty
also
dry
aftertaste
with
a
burnt
bread
sensation
and
somewhat
astringent
a
little
dissapointing
though
i
do
have
to
say
it
drinks
easy
like
most
beers
of
its
nationality
especially
with
a
bowl
of
steak
and
potato
soup
i
could
go
on
and
on
about
this
beer
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
this
is
in
the
top
3
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
if
you
can
find
it
drink
it
minimal
liight
tannish
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nice
amber
brown
hue
fruity
and
toffee
is
the
aroma
that
stands
out
medium
sweetness
that
is
balanced
nicely
with
medium
bitterness
full
body
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
somewhat
long
bitterness
in
the
finish
excited
to
try
any
beer
that
basically
invents
the
style
one
of
the
original
sticke
alts
and
after
a
few
sips
still
among
the
best
the
beer
begins
with
a
bright
rust
color
with
a
froathy
foamstand
that
raises
to
about
an
inch
and
disipates
slowly
through
the
session
moderate
caramel
aromas
swirl
about
a
pungent
grassy
fresh
hop
scent
that
promises
a
more
hoppy
alt
than
most
ive
had
flavors
are
more
dry
and
better
attenuated
than
the
nose
suggests
the
beer
has
some
lowlying
sweetness
but
stronger
caramel
flavors
crackerlike
and
lightly
biscuitlike
the
hops
are
quite
strong
and
balances
the
beer
beautifully
a
firm
bitterness
hangs
in
the
back
of
the
throat
while
giving
a
firm
floral
spicy
german
hop
herbalgrassy
flavor
super
crisp
and
dry
in
the
body
the
beer
basically
evaporates
in
the
mouth
finishes
with
a
balanced
caramel
hop
blend
that
lingers
well
into
the
finish
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
beer
thanks
again

murky
brown
in
color
very
little
head
on
the
pour
only
a
ring
of
froth
around
the
edges
smell
is
very
caramel
and
port
like
age
has
done
this
beer
wonders
very
creamy
and
very
dark
malts
plenty
of
aged
sherry
like
port
in
the
flavor
this
was
a
huge
surprise
very
well
done
very
tasty
beer
not
as
good
as
the
doppelsticke
but
certainly
worthy
of
a
taste
pours
a
murky
chestnut
with
a
thin
swirly
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
smells
of
fresh
grain
spicy
malt
a
touch
of
minerality
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
nice
flavor
that
are
a
bit
spicy
to
start
and
then
quite
mellow
the
spice
picks
up
again
at
the
finish
there
are
some
nice
cocoa
and
slightly
sweet
malt
notes
as
well
and
a
smooth
graininess
throughout
smooth
creamy
and
a
bit
spicy
in
the
mouth
very
enjoyable
d
everything
about
this
beer
was
pretty
interesting
from
the
bottle
to
the
look
of
the
brew
it
was
good
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
d
just
waiting
to
get
the
glass
mediumbodied
very
drinkable
well
balanced
between
caramel
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
another
deserved
world
classic
hoppier
than
their
other
altbier
or
their
doppelsticke
a
musttry
for
beer
lovers
overall
nothing
hugely
complex
or
mindblowing
here
but
wow
is
it
tasty
and
drinkable
this
ones
a
little
overthetop
in
alcohol
for
a
dusseldorf
altbier
never
the
less
good
balance
and
well
paired
german
malts
and
hops
i
dont
have
another
bottle
but
if
i
did
i
would
pass
up
in
dusseldorf
these
are
frequently
session
beers
and
im
just
not
picturing
this
with
the
same
level
of
drinkability
tasted
on
62608
a
bit
sweet
overall
but
very
flavorful
if
most
german
beers
are
lagers
and
rest
of
those
are
ales
and
most
of
those
are
wiessbiers
what
do
you
have
left
this
delicious
beer
of
course
overall
recommended
although
not
as
enjoyable
to
me
as
the
doppel
sticke
recommended
well
this
is
my
first
experience
with
german
alt
and
im
impressed
this
being
a
sticke
alt
is
a
bit
high
in
alcohol
to
be
a
session
beer
but
its
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
enough
for
seconds
i
need
more
now
pours
out
an
orangey
dark
caramel
with
a
thinnish
white
head
and
some
nice
abundant
ornamental
lacing
in
the
nose
is
lots
of
toast
toffee
and
dried
fruits
with
a
backing
of
very
pronounced
spicy
floral
and
woodsy
hops
the
malt
in
the
flavor
is
very
solid
with
a
little
less
fruitiness
than
in
the
nose
but
with
a
lot
more
toastiness
carameltoffee
is
holds
about
the
same
amount
of
weight
in
the
smell
there
is
also
some
sweet
moist
tobacco
in
here
what
surprises
me
is
the
very
loud
hops
they
are
extremely
floral
and
spicy
just
about
perfect
theres
a
nice
little
bit
of
bitter
astringency
in
the
finish
which
works
well
with
the
initial
hit
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
moderate
in
weight
but
its
kind
of
fizzy
for
me
delicious
this
is
definitely
the
best
the
best
altbier
ive
tried
very
quaffable
considering
the
abv
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
with
an
impressive
drinkability
i
dont
think
you
can
go
wrong
with
this
one
d
this
is
a
decent
altbier
but
i
cant
help
but
think
this
would
be
fantastic
when
its
fresher
and
in
dusselfdorf
this
is
the
beer
that
they
serve
periodically
throughout
the
year
unannounced
as
a
thanks
to
the
regulars
uerige
was
probably
my
favorite
place
we
stopped
at
when
visiting
dusseldorf
last
summer
i
didnt
have
the
good
fortune
of
catching
a
sticke
there
though
i
imagine
it
would
have
been
awesome
i
had
to
get
this
one
in
kc
d
drinkability
is
good
it
is
so
smooth
that
this
beer
can
be
dangerous
it
is
a
sweeter
beer
but
other
flavors
come
in
to
balance
out
the
sweet
characteristics
well
definitely
worth
a
try
enjoy
one
of
these
well
crafted
biers
prosit
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
some
carbonation
tiny
offwhite
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
very
slight
toffeecaramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
some
toffeecaramel
lightmedium
body
kinda
on
the
watery
side
drinkable
a
tasty
brew
tranparent
chestnut
body
with
amber
and
mahogany
highlights
topped
by
a
thick
rocky
head
that
really
lasts
a
long
time
aroma
has
a
very
pungent
hop
note
that
is
peppery
flavor
is
definitely
a
spicy
hop
flavor
but
not
as
intensely
bitter
as
expected
the
malt
and
hop
bitterness
are
balanced
fairly
well
although
the
hop
bite
does
slide
in
a
slight
herbal
bitterness
in
the
finish
hop
bitterness
gets
mor
epronounced
as
i
continue
to
sip
mouthfeel
is
good
perhaps
a
bit
thin
for
the
amount
of
flavor
going
on
here
drinkability
s
good
but
the
dopplesticke
is
actually
much
more
enjoyable
overall
a
really
nice
classic
beer
drinkability
i
had
no
idea
altbiers
could
be
so
complex
and
robust
this
is
an
eyeopening
beer
experience
highly
recommended
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
but
more
so
toasted
malts
nutty
with
not
as
much
caramel
as
the
aroma
good
bitterness
with
more
of
a
spicy
hop
palate
lite
medium
body
with
persistent
carbonation
very
very
drinkable
overall
more
complex
than
my
feeble
palate
and
brain
can
put
together
but
still
if
this
was
on
tap
at
my
neighborhood
spot
no
doubt
i
would
enjoy
pint
after
pint
wow
so
this
is
what
an
alt
is
supposed
to
be
double
bag
is
a
decent
beer
but
cant
hold
a
candle
to
this
drinkability
is
fairly
high
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
no
noticeable
alcohol
strength
and
great
flavors
t
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
winking
lizard
in
columbus
its
probably
the
most
definitive
altbier
ive
tried
and
definitely
tasty
the
beer
was
dark
copper
and
hazy
with
an
aroma
of
fresh
wort
very
malty
in
smell
and
taste
with
a
pleasing
aftertaste
very
drinkable
i
finished
the
glass
quicker
than
i
expected
interesting
complexity
hop
is
the
initial
flavor
on
the
taste
quickly
it
subsides
to
a
slightly
sweet
fullbodied
malty
liquor
the
bitterness
returns
and
continues
through
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
the
uerige
sticke
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
plan
to
indulge
in
often
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
nicely
balanced
beer
with
a
lasting
bitter
finish
overall
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
and
if
others
are
like
it
then
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
from
this
style
ill
start
with
my
overall
impression
which
is
that
this
is
probably
one
of
if
not
the
best
representation
that
ive
had
of
this
style
this
alt
is
very
well
balanced
with
a
slight
edge
going
to
the
malt
side
of
things
just
how
i
like
my
alts
the
nose
is
a
bit
more
delicate
than
id
expect
but
it
is
pleasant
and
again
leans
toward
the
malt
side
with
some
noble
hops
for
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
well
rounded
with
a
slight
very
slight
drying
effect
after
mid
bottle
the
subtle
sweetness
and
refreshing
hop
zest
make
this
beer
outlandishly
drinkable
a
tad
high
in
alcohol
to
be
sessionable
but
the
flavor
is
perfect
to
that
end
a
very
good
beer
and
a
great
introduction
into
the
altbier
style
ill
definitely
be
coming
back
to
this
one
this
is
a
very
drinkable
altbier
worth
a
try
for
sure
d
a
good
beer
not
something
i
could
drink
all
night
but
one
every
now
and
again
would
be
great
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
did
not
hold
a
head
very
long
and
appeareed
to
be
flat
however
the
tastewas
rather
sweet
and
it
was
a
bit
hoppy
to
the
palate
a
bit
of
a
mouldy
aftertaste
was
detected
or
peat
taste
i
should
say
the
beer
was
sienna
colored
i
will
not
buy
again
but
it
was
an
interesting
beer
you
should
try
it
comes
in
a
unique
fliptop
but
it
stands
strong
on
its
own
the
malt
is
a
nice
backdrop
but
its
the
nippy
noble
hops
that
take
the
crisp
cake
the
clean
finish
prepares
the
palate
for
each
ensuing
sampling
it
drinks
easily
and
with
a
refreshing
note
cool
bottle
and
cool
beer
a
cool
combo
this
is
a
great
beer
it
looks
great
it
tastes
great
its
drinkable
and
the
bottle
is
da
proverbial
bomb
this
beer
would
appeal
to
fans
of
many
beer
styles
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
everyone
uerige
sticke
is
a
unique
brew
brewed
in
dusseldorf
one
can
taste
and
smell
the
german
bock
flavors
in
it
pours
slightly
very
slightly
hazy
amber
color
really
tastes
like
a
bock
but
maintains
a
hint
of
belgian
amber
flavor
smooth
with
flavor
of
dark
fruits
and
malt
tawny
brown
color
slightly
cloudy
and
a
rocky
off
white
head
with
sticky
milky
like
crown
and
lace
bright
fruit
aromas
juicy
fruit
gum
and
light
florals
bubble
gum
toasted
grain
base
with
a
lazy
caramelized
sugar
sweetness
and
a
little
phenolic
hop
herbals
tea
leaves
a
spice
with
a
vegetablefruity
flavor
like
pink
peppercorns
slight
tartness
that
builds
and
goes
into
the
finish
with
some
dry
husky
grains
and
tea
herbals
in
the
back
as
it
warms
some
of
that
fruity
nose
comes
into
play
its
odd
how
little
the
nose
corresponds
with
the
flavor
here
almost
no
similarities
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
carbonation
that
starts
out
great
but
flattens
a
bit
midway
i
thought
id
enjoy
this
beer
more
than
i
did
perhaps
it
sitting
several
months
in
my
fridge
was
the
problem
so
take
my
opinion
of
this
with
a
grain
of
salt
as
i
liked
the
smaller
alt
from
this
brewery
appearance
was
a
ruddy
hazy
lightish
brown
with
an
offwhitetan
head
nose
was
caramel
nuts
and
what
i
thought
were
alcoholrum
notes
which
seemed
weird
taste
was
figs
nuts
caramel
and
sweet
dark
malt
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
presence
again
which
does
not
make
sense
for
this
beer
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
frothy
and
almost
medium
in
body
drying
finish
with
a
bit
of
roastiness
ill
take
another
go
at
this
one
in
the
future
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
overall
i
like
it
very
much
and
i
hope
that
i
can
find
some
more
close
to
home
i
bought
this
in
chicago
if
you
know
of
a
place
close
to
me
that
stocks
it
please
beermail
me
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
excellent
representation
of
style
good
kick
this
beer
is
wellworth
drinking
for
a
whole
evening
but
i
like
the
classic
version
a
little
bit
better
at
once
overcarbonated
and
a
touch
thin
not
a
total
mess
just
a
bit
unbalanced
overall
however
this
is
a
wonderful
alt
exceptionally
sessionable
and
never
close
to
being
boring
strangely
high
rate
of
carbonation
accentuates
the
bitterness
an
odd
beer
to
be
sure
looks
weird
smells
pretty
uninteresting
tastes
pretty
good
given
the
level
of
bitterness
this
is
definitely
the
freshest
batch
of
this
ive
sampled
but
im
still
not
convinced
bottle
poured
a
flat
deep
brown
color
alt
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
no
lacing
aroma
of
huge
caramel
malt
with
some
sweetness
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
sweet
malt
with
loads
of
caramel
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
no
real
carbonation
interesting
and
refreshing
but
nothing
really
earth
shattering
in
here
d
since
this
is
an
underwhelming
brew
i
would
not
return
to
it
however
i
am
hoping
that
once
again
i
got
an
old
bottle
will
repeat
this
taste
on
tap
in
germany
next
year
drinkability
starts
off
with
a
great
aroma
but
the
taste
slips
just
a
bit
oh
and
what
an
adorable
looking
bottle
d
this
beer
has
some
interesting
flavors
but
they
are
very
soft
and
a
bit
watery
upon
supping
palate
is
smacked
with
more
malty
goodness
a
big
caramel
malt
presence
mingled
with
plums
dates
and
raisins
actually
many
ingredients
of
a
good
bread
pudding
and
the
cookiedoughlike
character
is
still
there
as
well
cookiedough
in
a
bread
pudding
why
not
a
fine
thread
of
faint
herbal
hoppiness
comes
around
before
powdery
grain
husk
brings
in
the
finale
moderate
carbonation
cleans
and
dries
out
the
finish
further

its
effervescence
creates
subtle
earthy
notes
that
were
perhaps
missed
in
the
initial
nose
a
semilight
creamy
mouthfeel
keep
this
very
drinkable
and
im
sad
this
cool
bottle
is
so
very
small
a
very
easy
to
drink
ale
with
plenty
of
depth
and
character
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
i
could
drink
several
of
these
with
pretzels
on
hand
it
reminds
me
of
a
sweeter
vienna
lager
somehow
uerige
sticke
was
a
nice
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
head
was
fairly
large
and
had
decent
retention
leaving
some
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
toasty
and
nutty
the
taste
was
toased
malt
and
some
spice
with
sweetness
upfront
and
a
nice
bitterness
towards
the
end
with
a
long
very
dry
finish
it
was
medium
in
body
with
a
fine
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
with
lots
of
complex
aromas
and
flavors
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
dopplesticke
the
drinkability
is
good
buti
wouldlove
to
find
this
on
tap
some
day
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
final
verdict
uerige
makes
some
incredible
beers
id
recommend
trying
them
all
quite
drinkable
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
more
when
i
find
it
again
an
excellent
alt
the
body
is
fairly
thin
and
crisp
but
the
carbonation
is
still
fairly
soft
on
the
palate
the
balance
really
is
something
to
behold
i
could
drink
this
all
night
which
i
probably
couldnt
say
for
the
doppelsticke
even
though
i
quite
enjoyed
it
as
well
i
will
probably
revisit
this
one
fairly
often
as
long
as
it
stays
fresh
and
i
will
have
to
try
the
original
as
well
cheers
drinkability
eh
not
a
beer
i
would
reccommend
but
its
not
wretched
either
this
sticke
altbier
poured
a
clear
coppery
color
with
light
tan
creamy
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
leaving
lace
the
smell
was
sweetly
malty
with
notes
of
munich
malt
hint
of
grape
skins
the
taste
was
sweetly
malty
with
the
pils
malt
at
for
fore
and
a
bit
of
munich
malt
beneath
there
was
a
good
hoppy
bitterness
to
balance
but
the
sweet
malt
won
out
over
the
hops
there
was
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
sweet
and
malty
with
mediumfull
body
and
modest
carbonation
the
finish
was
hoppy
this
was
a
good
beer
though
a
bit
sweet
the
regular
altbier
was
a
welcomed
respite
after
and
evening
of
this
sticke
alt
overall
impression
the
aroma
and
flavor
didnt
match
for
me
it
was
a
much
sweeter
aroma
with
a
much
drier
flavor
still
one
heck
of
an
enjoyable
beer
glad
i
tried
it
for
the
value
i
probably
wont
try
this
very
often
but
its
a
great
example
strongly
recommended
cheers
d
cant
say
much
else
other
than
this
is
tasty
enough
to
keep
me

very
cleansing
and
satisfying
session
beer
drinkability
for
my
200th
beer
review
i
thought
i
would
try
a
style
of
beer
i
havent
had
before
in
a
cool
bottle
and
i
was
glad
to
try
this
beer
its
something
i
might
like
to
try
again
in
the
future
but
i
would
like
more
is
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
to
see
what
their
others
beers
are
like
thats
if
i
can
find
any
more
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
and
smooth
mildly
carbonated
a
very
nice

drinkable

sticke
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
minimal
head
from
a
brown
33
cl
swingtop
bottle
aroma
is
a
little
fruity
maybe
even
a
little
hoppy
nice
chewy
malt
flavor
but
balanced
well
with
hop
definitely
the
best
alt
ive
tried
recommended
12oz
bottle
light
brown
with
some
copper
slightly
cloudy
essentially
no
head
formed
the
foam
scraps
were
light
tan
aroma
was
very
malty
coming
through
as
molasses
other
scents
included
alcoholphenol
and
raisins
no
hops
to
be
found
taste
stayed
in
character
with
the
smell
pretty
sweet
with
alcoholmedicinal
notes
in
the
middle
hops
showed
up
as
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
body
was
medium
and
carbonation
was
light
the
beer
had
a
smooth
coating
feel
to
it
finish
was
drying
overall
ok
but
not
my
favorite
alt
and
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
the
head
was
thin
and
quickly
disappated
the
initial
flavor
is
a
bit
hoppy
and
bitter
transitioning
into
a
malty
almost
doppelbock
like
flavor
the
beer
is
dry
and
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
it
hides
its
alcohol
content
well
a
flavorful
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
pours
with
a
rust
and
dirt
colored
body
and
minimal
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
there
is
little
carbonation
apparent
smells
are
of
figs
and
molasses
sweet
smells
like
a
doppelbock
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
palate
theres
first
a
metallic
bite
then
some
figgy
fruits
somehow
the
taste
is
creamy
and
minerally
at
the
same
time
long
dry
finish
with
pinpricks
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
still
and
smooth
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
hides
its
abv
well
this
is
one
to
sip
with
company

after
it
warmed
up
the

came
through
in

a
wellcrafted
example
of
an
altbier
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
sharing
this
example
of
an
uncommon
style
liquid
copper
in
a
glass
head
is
around
an
inch
thick
and
the
color
of
a
marshmellow
nose
is
a
bit
understated
but
i
get
honey
and
caramel
taste
is
much
the
same
but
the
alcohol
gives
me
the
idea
that
maybe
they
arent
trying
to
conceal
it
its
in
your
face
theres
also
a
grainy
and
sour
taste
in
the
finish
that
isnt
unpleasant
mouth
is
very
nice
thanks
to
clickpush
for
providing
this
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
as
a
few
bottles
can
easily
be
quaffed
nicely
balanced
and
hits
the
tastebuds
just
right
nice
coppery
color
no
real
head
but
a
decent
carbonation
level
aroma
of
caramel
and
toasted
malt
somewhat
of
a
metallic
or
industrial
tinge
to
it
slight
frutiness
very
nice
malty
caramel
flavor
trace
of
bitternessalmost
more
of
an
alcohol
tinge
then
hops
good
body
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
ages
i
actually
prefer
the
double
sticke
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
none
the
less
drinkability
moderate
abv
good
malt
flavor
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
all
day
long
very
satisfying
great
balance
of
fresh
hops
and
nutty
caramel
body
mouthfeel
a
little
sweet
but
most
of
the
palate
was
centered
around
the
malt
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
all
around
hand
carried
back
from
kansas
city
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
fine
and
tight
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
reasonably
drinkable
but
not
quite
as
satisfying
for
my
palate
as
an
american
amber
ale
i
did
a
little
research
and
found
out
that
this
beer
is
only
brewed
twice
a
year
each
third
tuesday
in
january
and
october
notes
when
you
see
this
grab
a
bunch
usually
around
45
a
bottle
if
i
lived
in
germany
this
would
most
definately
be
in
my
stable
at
all
times
in
high
quanity
outstanding
light
hazy
mahogany
body
supports
a
smallish
offwhite
head
despite
a
vigorous
pour
nice
balanced
aroma
of
sweet
malt
cracker
malt
and
citrusy
hops
flavor
has
much
higher
hop
notes
than
the
aroma
citrus
pine
and
bitter
hops
crisp
bitey
and
peppery
mouthfeel
is
good
and
round
with
light
carbonation
very
pleasing
and
drinkable
overall
somewhat
less
enjoyable
than
the
doppelsticke
but
still
very
nice
price
is
a
bit
high
for
an
everyday
beer
but
good
for
special
occasions
taste
mmm
lots
of
malts
caramel
and
molasses
dried
figs
and
cherries
walnuts
and
some
allspice
theres
just
a
bit
of
a
hop
bitterness
towards
the
end
to
balance
it
out
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
so
easy
to
drink
its
almost
gone
and
i
feel
like
i
just
started
drinking
it
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
nothing
out
of
this
world
spectacular
but
something
ill
buy
again
and
again
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
again
to
confirm
the
nature
of
this
beer
lots
of
sweet
malt
in
the
aroma
caramel
brown
sugar
and
molasses
light
amber
in
color
with
a
head
that
is
both
creamy
and
bubbly
has
a
deep
fruity
sweetness
in
the
fore
followed
by
a
crisp
but
tongue
coating
flavor
of
peanut
skins
never
come
across
that
before
in
a
beer
and
then
the
moment
is
over
the
aftertaste
is
quite
clean
with
just
a
faint
remembrance
of
what
a
wonderful
experience
it
was
just
try
not
to
quaff
it
down
too
fast
what
a
beer
what
a
beer
malt
was
the
star
of
the
uerige
sticke
it
was
a
well
balanced
tasty
ale
pours
from
the
uniquely
shaped
bottle
with
a
short
vanilla
colored
head
of
tiny
bubbles
that
quickly
reduces
itself
to
a
few
lingerers
at
the
edges
the
soft
copper
and
amber
highlighted
beer
produces
only
a
few
small
carbonation
streams
the
smell
is
carmelly
and
sweet
but
with
subtle
hop
notes
the
taste
is
initially
malty
and
sweet
and
finishes
with
nice
gentle
hops
that
linger
a
short
time
the
flavors
are
well
integrated
and
beautifully
balanced
soft
mouthfeel
and
medium
bodied
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
absolutely
drinkable
following
the
indomitable
paulk
and
his
tognues
on
this
review
poured
a
brown
color
very
clear
not
much
of
a
head
and
it
appeared
fairly
flat
nose
is
a
bit
biscuity
with
some
nice
toasted
malts
flavor
is
simple
malts
fairly
sweet
at
first
but
then
swiftly
followed
by
a
nice
hop
presence
sweet
with
a
bit
of
berries
toward
the
end
very
nice
and
light
extremely
easy
drinking
drinkability
a
style
that
i
like
but
havent
been
able
to
try
too
many
of
uerige
is
maybe
the
most
distinctive
alt
brewer
just
because
of
their
unique
and
eye
grabbing
bottles
it
is
a
good
beer
one
of
the
better
alts
i
have
tried
thanks
again
to
luckysevens82
this
is
the
best
alt
i
have
had
to
date
hands
down
from
a
unique
longnecked
swingtop
bottle
this
brew
pours
a
deep
reddish
earthy
color
the
beer
sports
a
very
thin
white
persistent
head
theres
considerable
malt
in
the
aroma
lots
of
caramel
along
with
a
lightly
toasted
viennalike
character
very
light
hop
smell
also
mingles
with
the
malt
but
takes
a
decidedly
back
seat
slightly
dry
and
nutty
taste
with
the
malt
character
following
through
bitterness
develops
late
in
the
midtaste
and
the
beer
finishes
with
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
very
clean
and
crispreminiscent
of
a
lager
very
drinkable
with
an
entertaining
balance
this
is
an
extraordinarily
good
brew
overall
this
is
my
third
uerige
and
i
dont
love
it
as
much
as
the
classic
alt
or
the
doppelsticke
those
both
had
nicer
appearances
held
their
heads
better
and
didnt
have
the
little
off
flavors
throughout
finish
is
smooth
and
cleansing
and
it
is
drinkable
just
a
funky
old
school
brew
in
an
overpriced
bottle
mouthfeel
was
extremely
light
the
carbonation
even
made
it
more
so
which
i
feel
detracted
a
bit
however
this
also
just
increased
the
already
drinkable
nature
of
the
brew

i
could

not

it

excellent

this
is
kind
of

not
a

medium

with
a

it
very
good
full

drinkability
as
someone
who
developed
his
love
for
beer
in
the
zum
uerige
brewpub
in
1968
i
was
anxious
to
try
this
secret
offering
i
was
not
disappointed
this
brew
is
eminently
drinkable
with
a
maltier
and
hoppier
character
than
the
usual
alt
beer
offered
by
zum
uerige
bad

if
nothing
else
poured
out
to
a
brown
amber
color
with
a
small
head
and
some
traces
of
lace
lower
carbonation
odors
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
were
most
noted
along
with
some
alcohol
taste
was
pretty
good
flavors
of
sweet
floral
earth
and
malt
with
a
nice
crips
hoppy
finish
finished
a
bit
dry
and
rather
smooth
a
good
beer
as
now
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
of
the
other
varites
from
uerige
obergärige
hausbrauerei
recommended
for
those
with
a
more
developed
taste
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
ruby
amber
color
that
is
topped
by
a
frothy
thinnish
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
quite
fruity
with
notes
of
brandy
and
rum
hints
of
strawberry
citrus
and
lightly
spicy
notes
actually
a
fairly
interesting
aroma
that
is
still
intriguing
after
these
6
months
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
fairly
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
this
is
quite
fruity
as
well
with
notes
of
cherry
raisins
and
a
bit
of
strawberry
and
some
notes
of
bergemot
as
well
for
some
reason
the
fruity
character
in
an
alt
i
have
always
associated
as
an
interesting
mix
of
hop
and
malt
character
this
has
held
up
much
better
in
the
voyage
across
the
atlantic
than
the
regular
alt
did
though
it
stills
suffers
quite
a
bit
from
the
voyage
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
brown
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
i
thought
it
might
be
flatvery
sweet
aromas
of
caramel
malt
and
roasted
nuts
very
slick
mouthfeel
slides
down
easy
flavors
are
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
cloyingcaramel
dominates
the
flavors
with
an
underlying
roasted
maltiness
finishing
with
just
a
little
herbal
hop
a
good
beer
no
doubt
as
good
as
i
thought
and
the
hypenot
sure
thanks
to
joe

in

for
the
heads
up
on
a
great
alt

provided
by

thanks
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
single
finger
tan
head
over
a
cloudy
rust
orangebrown
liquid
smells
caramel
malty
with
a
sour
tang
thats
almost
citrusy
pine
sollike
searching
beneath
that
unpleasant
aroma
i
get
nuts
chocolate
and
a
grassy
herbal
tastes
sweet
nutty
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
piercing
sour
countering
beneath
yeah
im
sorry
but
that
sour
pinesol
flavor
is
just
ruining
it
for
me
lets
see
what
i
can
get
after
it
warms
to
room
temperature
the
sour
is
still
present
but
it
comes
across
as
more
of
a
black
patent
sour
than
a
pine
sol
sour
there
is
also
come
coffee
roast
medium
body
with
a
sugary
thickness
and
mildly
carbonated
certainly
not
a
favorite
of
mine
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
top10
best
looking
beer
bottles
in
the
world
the
shape
the
embossing
the
classy
label
and
the
swingtop
say
im
special
i
agree
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
i
was
in
danger
of
running
out
of
beer
while
still
pondering
the
hidden
charms
of
the
multidimensional
flavor
profile
i
would
love
to
have
another
bottle
in
front
of
me
uerige
sticke
is
great
beer
and
is
by
far
the
best
altbier
that
ive
had
yet
overall
ive
had
this
before
but
i
remember
it
being
better
maybe
i
should
have
reviewed
it
then
and
maybe
my
tastes
have
changed
since
then
ill
have
another
for
a
best
2
outta
three
almost
perfect
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
to
style
and
despite
what
i
prefer
but
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
overall
a
very
good
altbier
and
a
definite
must
try
nice
flip
top
action
on
the
bottle
the
beer
exits
a
foamy
and
clear
ruby
into
a
big
chalice
aroma
reeks
of
caramel
malts
accompanied
by
light
red
fruits
and
burnt
sugar
spicy
rye
breadiness
in
the
flavor
provides
a
smooth
but
intense
experience
that
finished
with
a
pointed
bitterness
has
the
potential
to
be
huge
but
suffers
from
a
lack
of
gravity
try
the
doppelsticke
for
the
experience
you
want
out
of
this
beer
but
fail
to
have
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
very
flavorful
it
simply
does
not
satisfy
on
the
complexity
that
the
initial
contact
promises
drinkability
and
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
the
uerige
altbier
classic
is
much
better
in
my
opinion
this
one
lacks
the
fullness
and
complexity
i
expected
it
still
a
good
brew
a
nice
example
of
an
altbier
and
one
worth
trying
pours
a
clear
ambertanbrown
color
very
little
carbonation
what
bubbles
do
form
are
extremely
small
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
plum
first
sip
starts
with
a
rich
creamy
texture
that
gives
way
to
a
hoppy
bitter
after
taste
as
i
drink
and
it
warms
the
creaminess
starts
to
wane
the
malt
quickly
is
taken
over
by
the
grassy
hops
as
the
glass
nears
the
end
the
brew
seems
exceedingly
smooth
when
i
first
started
drinking
i
thought
this
was
interesting
and
nice
but
i
would
want
to
change
to
something
else
when
finished
now
that
it
is
gone
i
wish
i
had
another
drinkability
isnt
easy
to
set
as
i
only
have
one
bottle
of
this
i
was
made
familiar
with
the
altbier
style
through
alaskan
amber
a
brew
i
enjoy
at
least
once
a
month
alaskan
amber
is
a
near
perfect
session
beer
this
beer
is
much
stronger
than
alaskan
amber
in
smell
and
bitterness
but
it
isnt
more
pleasant
to
drink
just
different
very
drinkable
with
the
small
abv
pours
out
a
rich
copper
color
pretty
much
the
color
of
a
penny
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
appears
smells
of
rich
caramel
and
molases
kind
of
a
roasty
aroma
but
not
burnt
taste
is
of
mellow
caramel
sweet
and
sugary
but
not
thick
and
syrupy
at
all
the
herbal
hops
balance
this
one
out
perfectly
wow
is
this
incredibly
smooth
i
could
really
pound
these
puppies
down
cool
bottle
but
damn
pricey
is
there
a
comparable
alt
i
think
this
version
of
the
uerige
altbier
is
wonderfully
put
together
just
like
the
everyday
brew
is
it
better
well
its
flavors
are
more
assertive
though
just
as
nicely
balanced
i
cant
choose
so
i
guess
ill
have
to
enjoy
each
according
to
my
mood
of
the
moment
the
beer
evacuates
the
330ml
brown
swingtop
bottle
a
somewhat
hazy
copper
with
a
moderate
size
frothy
light
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
a
thin
coating
of
lace
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
hints
of
hops
fresh
and
crisp
nutlike
start
is
nicely
malted
light
at
the
top
finish
is
moderately
carbonated
with
the
hops
pleasantly
spicy
extremely
dry
and
somewhat
sour
aftertaste
lingers
long
upon
the
palate
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
much
prefer
the
dopplesticke
a
must
buy
beer
for
ale
lovers
note
although
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
have
some
before
this
is
the
first
altbier
ive
sampled
i
can
see
myself
buying
this
again
someday
but
it
also
makes
me
want
to
branch
out
and
try
other
altbiers
hopefully
the
others
can
stand
up
to
my
first
impression
im
a
bit
disapointed
in
this
brew
the
regular
alt
is
quite
good
this
one
seems
to
fall
short
dark
coppery
color
and
fair
bit
of
tan
head
are
spot
on
and
the
aroma
is
quite
pleasing
with
a
bit
of
nutty
malt
and
floral
hops
present
flavor
starts
well
but
the
bitterness
was
unpleasant
and
possibly
a
bit
medicinal
a
good
start
that
fell
flat
mouthfeel
is
good
a
great
balance
of
substance
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
the
regular
offering
i
was
lucky
to
find
this
during
a
recent
trip
to
frederick
md
if
you
can
believe
it
a
neat
fliptop
rubber
cork
supposedly
will
keep
it
fresh
once
opened
but
my
sample
went
in
about
15
minutes
proof
of
its
drinkability
it
opens
with
a
thick
head
that
sssllllooowwwlllly
dissolves
without
a
bit
of
lacing
the
color
was
a
cross
between
amber
and
copper
those
dusselldorfers
do
know
their
bier
i
detected
an
applelike
smell
but
maybe
it
was
just
my
sensorial
schematics
the
sticke
german
for

a
fact
which
other

may
have
addressed
i

to

while

cloying
strange

aftertaste
very
unpleasant
hard
to
review
this
beer
it
smells
fantastic
all
the
rich
malty
notes
from
quality
dark
european
beers
like
toffee
raisin
molasses
etc
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
but
its
just
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
mouthfeel
is
full
a
little
syrupy
sweetness
lingers
after
the
swallow
so
although
i
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
because
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
cloying
i
can
tell
its
well
made
and
is
what
it
is
really
i
can
others
enjoying
it
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
i
imagine
it
would
go
well
with
game
meat
the
beers
full
body
makes
it
a
slow
sipping
affair
but
the
thinning
effects
of
aged
acidity
and
alcohol
keeps
the
taste
palatable
and
manageable
to
avoid
cloying
its
long
and
savory
finish
is
chocked
full
of
umami
and
spiced
rum
had
this
at
christmas
and
it
massively
exceeded
my
expectations
wonderfully
balanced
quirky
beer
with
a
complex
mix
of
flavours
caramel
raisins
prunes
lots
of
malt
not
overly
sweet
shares
some
characteristics
with
doppelbocks
but
the
alcohol
is
much
better
disguised
really
hope
to
track
this
down
again
taste
like
fugde
very
sweet
butter
with
some
ogange
zest
and
a
quite
nice
bitter
finish
o
a
nice
dessert
beer
but
pretty
intense
with
some
rough
edges
not
very
balanced
and
that
is
a
pity
wow
this
is
a
grand
brew
very
enjoyable
and
satisfying
dark
rich
light
fruit
and
toffee
nice
cap
to
a
great
evening
fantastic
like
a
cross
between
a
belgian
quad
and
a
barleywine
well
balanced
with
a
bit
of
boozy
warmth
this
will
put
some
warmth
on
my
body
this
is
one
beer
that
every
beer
geek
needs
to
try
on
their
journey
overall
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
the
aromas
and
flavors
were
good
but
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
i
also
didnt
care
for
the
excessively
thick
and
sticky
mouthfeel
definitely
sticke
a
maltheavy
altbier
that
i
could
drink
all
day
its
appearance
is
outstanding
saying
trink
while
its
flavor
makes
you
want
to
drain
the
glass
or
bottle
or
tap
a
lovely
malt
bomb
low
b
this
brew
shows
a
dark
and
hazy
mahogany
color
with
a
decent
but
delicate
light
tan
head
and
a
sure
cascading
lace
the
aroma
offers
deep
caramel
maple
malt
with
a
subtle
grassy
edge
maybe
a
little
chocolate
licorice
to
boot
nice
the
flavor
climaxes
with
an
intense
sweet
licorice
malt
and
more
grassy
hops
theres
a
bit
of
rhubarb
tartness
and
deep
root
beer
flavor
it
is
a
little
sweeter
than
i
normally
like
but
its
tolerable
as
you
enjoy
the
combined
flavors
it
finishes
a
bit
harsh
at
the
back
of
the
palate
with
a
modest
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
from
this
medium
bodied
brew
i
would
say
that
theres
a
cloying
quality
here
that
interferes
with
the
enjoyment
but
they
get
kudos
for
big
flavor
this
might
be
the
oldest
beer
ive
ever
consumed
it
was
amazing
the
strong
altbier
had
turned
into
a
rich
barleywine
like
ale
almost
like
a
very
dry
old
ale
some
oxidation
was
present
but
it
didnt
really
detract
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
omy
limited
experience
with
other
altbiers
was
nothing
like
this
whereas
those
other
beers
were
mellow
and
lighter
in
body
this
beer
is
hugely
complex
and
substantial
a
real
sipper
i
kept
thinking
i
was
drinking
a
quad
or
a
hoppedup
dubbel
because
the
malt
profile
was
so
huge
and
similar
in
flavor
im
not
sure
how
true
to
style
this
beer
is
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
definitely
drink
more
my
rating
will
be
skewed
as
a
result
of
the
appearance
which
really
didnt
appeal
to
me
but
i
otherwise
found
this
beer
to
be
good
and
presenting
a
lot
of
different
aromas
and
flavors
id
like
to
try
this
more
often
and
perhaps
much
fresher
to
determine
whether
my
rating
reserves
an
adjustment
still
im
a
fan
nice
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
younger
sample
the
stales
distracts
on
the
intake
yet
can
still
imagine
what
a
fresh
version
would
be
will
seek
out
a
younger
one
in
time
good
beer
definitely
as
malty
as
i
expected
and
without
a
doubt
a
far
purer
altbier
a
polar
opposite
in
so
many
respects
from
the
rival
kölsch
recipe
across
the
rhine
nevertheless
i
doubt
we
get
these
as
fresh
as
id
like
in
the
us
the
oxidized
notes
are
obvious
and
the
malts
are
far
more
on
the
sweetened
honeyed
side
more
than
i
personally
enjoy
it
to
be
heres
hoping
fresher
german
altbiers
will
come
into
the
us
for
now
i
will
sip
on
this
let
it
lay
me
down
like
the
boozy
malty
elixir
that
it
has
become
the
beer
pours
a
dull
coppery
brown
with
chunks
of
yeast
and
no
head
definitely
looking
both
german
and
malty
the
nose
is
definitely
sweet
with
bit
of
fruity
yeast
and
alcohol
on
the
back
end
the
taste
delivers
the
goods
as
expected
with
fruit
and
malt
upfront
reminiscent
of
figs
and
plums
and
a
lingering
burn
from
the
alcohol
clouding
the
palate
and
sloughing
off
some
taste
buds
when
it
finally
dissipates
its
medium
bodied
yeasty
undercarbonated
slightly
boozy
and
quite
malty
this
is
a
tasty
brew
malty
and
boozy
thanks
for
sharing
doc
great
beer
to
have
on
a
fall
night
would
not
want
to
drink
this
daily
but
its
very
enjoyable
o
nifty
beer
better
flavor
than
the
smell
not
my
normal
style
but
i
did
enjoy
it
i
probably
wont
purchase
again
more
because
i
would
rather
have
a
good
stout
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
taste
caramel
malt
with
raisin
and
fig
notes
and
a
bready
malt
that
comes
through
just
before
the
bittering
hops
lay
a
spiciness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
warming
alcohol
heat
that
does
not
come
through
in
taste
except
for
maybe
a
little
sweetness
o
overall
very
good
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
the
higher
abv
doesnt
overwhelm
the
flavors
at
all
would
definitely
buy
this
again
this
beer
is
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
drink
but
i
cant
say
its
really
my
style
of
beer
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
though
id
like
to
try
some
other
beers
of
this
style
o
great
balance
of
flavors
that
are
smooth
and
palate
pleasing
the
aged
presence
really
shines
here
this
is
a
beer
i
will
be
gravity
g
more
of
soon
cheers
o
very
full
flavor
glad
it

you
will

a

some
sort
of
smoked
dopple
bock
or
something
this
is
my
first
encounter
with
one
thanks
to
the
legendary
claystation
this
oddity
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brown
color
with
visible
carbonation
and
a
homebrewed
root
beer
looking
head
nice
and
thick
and
just
off
white
the
nose
is
sweet
and
smoky
not
quite
on
the
rauchbier
level
but
definitely
pronounced
there
are
a
mix
of
dark
roasted
as
well
as
sweeter
caramel
grains
and
some
yeast
thats
about
strong
enough
to
break
it
all
down
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
huge
about
as
much
intensity
as
can
be
packed
into
a
single
very
interestingly
shaped
bottle
long
graham
crackery
sweetness
all
the
way
through
some
pleasant
oak
smoke
up
front
and
noticeable
relaxing
alcohol
content
that
seems
appropriate
with
all
this
malt
density
claystation
described
it
as
meaty
like
downright
bacon
i
was
less
inclined
to
say
meat
and
more
maybe
just
smoke
i
guess
i
can
see
some
beef
jerky
going
on
here
but
its
not
pervasive
long
sweet
finish
the
feel
is
as
full
bodied
as
they
come
and
the
carbonation
is
decent
but
hardly
lightens
the
texture
up
at
all
this
is
a
bomb
a
bottle
to
be
shared
and
one
of
the
more
unique
german
beers
ive
encountered
not
sure
ill
rush
to
find
one
again
but
i
enjoyed
the
experience
and
thought
process
involved
here
overall
an
interesting
beer
kind
of
tastes
like
a
dubbelbarley
wine
but
with
some
gruit
like
flavours
mixed
in
not
something
id
drink
a
whole
lot
of
but
points
for
originality
full
of
character
at
first
kick
as
a
mule
with
its
intense
flavors
from
the
ueriges
versions
i
believe
the
sticke
is
the
most
balanced
also
flavorful
but
still
with
high
drinkability
to
drink
this
version
is
best
at
winter
or
for
a
slow
degustation
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
and
goes
down
easy
poured
into
a
stange
glass
pours
dark
copper
with
a
near
fingerlength
offwhite
head
the
beer
is
mostly
opaque
but
there
is
some
light
visible
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
dissipates
leaving
a
thin
cap
of
lace
atop
the
beer
the
beer
smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
toffee
plum
and
raisin
its
a
very
rich
and
inviting
aroma
like
their
standard
alt
the
beer
has
more
hop
notes
than
you
would
expect
just
from
the
nose
theres
a
strong
bready
malt
backbone
with
some
toffee
sweetness
plum
and
raisin
theres
some
earthy
and
woody
hop
notes
in
this
beer
that
come
through
rather
well
to
balance
everything
out
and
provides
some
satisfying
back
end
bitterness
i
cant
taste
the
8
5
abv
because
it
is
masked
very
well
the
body
is
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
has
a
dry
finish
this
is
pleasantly
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
taste
is
like
a
raisin
rolled
in
brown
sugar
drizzled
with
dark
rum
and
thrown
in
a
pan
on
high
heat
with
no
oil
or
butter
quite
decadent
and
the
alcohol
feels
bigger
than
8
5
surprising
considering
how
rich
the
beer
is
mouthfeel
is
great
and
silky
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
even
with
the
fairly
steep
pricetag
this
is
an
outstanding
slow
sipping
beer
not
so
strong
as
to
make
you
comatose
a
welcome
addition
to
any
cold
weather
beer
drinking
wow
this
was
difficult
to
score
because
ive
never
had
quite
an
ale
like
this
i
paced
myself
but
by
the
end
i
wish
id
had
a
much
bigger
mug
of
this
oh
boy
overall
one
of
the
neater
bottles
ive
held
and
i
was
happy
to
go
for
a
few
more
experience
points
in
a
lesser
known
style
but
i
didnt
love
it
this
certainly
could
purely
be
personal
preference
m
for
a
beer
this
stickysweet
it
doesnt
at
all
feel
it
thats
a
good
thing
drinks
very
clean
off
the
palate
overall
very
interesting
stuff
here
cant
say
ive
had
anything
like
it
before
edit
just
checked
havent
had
anything
of
this
style
before
not
sure
if
its
my
thing
or
not
but
id
try
it
again
to
see
drinkability
high
initial
sweetness
is
well
balanced
by
sharper
flavors
and
bitterness
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
wish
more
breweries
made
doppelsticke
beers
o
very
unique
and
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
im
not
in
a
hurry
to
have
another
but
respect
it
for
what
it
is
overall
uerige
doppelsticke
is
a
fantastic
altbier
it
is
easy
to
see
why
it
is
rated
at
the
top
of
the
style
i
will
certainly
be
getting
many
more
bottles
of
this
in
the
future
i
wish
there
were
a
bros
score
because
sometimes
there
is
a
large
discrepancy
between
the
ba
score
and
the
bros
score
i
dont
know
this
strikes
me
as
the
eku28
or
the
samiclaus
did
when
i
was
just
a
younger
man
with
lots
of
fruity
brandylike
tastes
and
apparently
a
whole
lot
of
alcohol
its
just
not
my
idea
of
a
good
time
although
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
someone
is
brewing
this
stuff
it
definitely
is
a
sipper
as
opposed
to
a
hungry
brew
and
i
think
back
to
a
thomas
hardy
i
had
back
then
also
thats
it
its
similar
to
a
thomas
hardy
gawd
that
stuff
was
a
gagger
then
and
its
a
still
a
gagger
now
even
if
i
do
feel
i
have
refined
my
taste
buds
a
bit
i
appreciate
the
taste
but
it
just
isnt
someting
id
buy
a
lot
of
review
from
122010
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
dark
dark
red
amber
nice
light
tan
head
and
lots
of
lacing
malt
roast
malt
and
fruit
aroma
excellent
presentation
both
the
head
and
aroma
are
very
nice
medium
to
heavy
bodied
strong
malt
toasted
malts
and
dark
fruits
up
front
middle
and
finish
with
a
tannic
bitter
malt
flavor
i
like
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
but
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
astringent
for
me
well
made
but
not
quite
to
my
taste
overall
this
is
a
tasty
treat
to
be
sipped
and
cherished
not
much
of
a
session
drink
but
beyond
worthy
to
the
distinguished
palate
the
burnt
malt
is
somewhat
to
excessively
strong
and
seems
to
take
away
from
other
more
discrete
flavor
profiles
wonderful
but
id
prefer
the
lower
alcohol
offerings
from
this
brewery
as
far
as
taste
and
balance
is
concerned
o
a
very
intriguing
balance
of
flavors
in
this
rich
ale
recommended
o
incredibly
tasty
i
would
gladly
polish
of
as
many
of
these
as
i
could
but
also
i
would
take
as
much
time
as
i
could
possibly
in
doing
so
the
alcohol
content
should
make
most
people
wary
of
drinking
one
of
these
quickly
but
im
young
and
its
the
weekend
fantastic
brew
o
this
beer
is
well
balanced
between
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
bitterness
but
the
mouthfeel
and
the
higher
abv
make
this
a
beer
that
you
could
have
only
a
single
in
a
session
this
is
a
sipping
beer
and
is
not
sessionable
o
a
very
nice
beer
if
you
are
a
malt
bomb
fanatic
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
complex
but
straightforward
keep
in
mind
this
beer
is
an
imperial
alt
beer
very
well
executed
and
very
enjoyable
wow
words
cannot
describe
the
aroma
of
this
beer
this
is
a
malt
lovers
dream
come
true
very
complex
layers
that
meld
wonderfully
good
alcohol
presents
that
fits
perfectly
in
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
o
excellent
altbier
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
lots
of
complex
flavors
and
aromas
nice
sipping
beer
at
8
5
abv
o
i
dont
want
to
say
terrible
but
what
could
have
been
really
cool
is
absolutely
ruined
by
whatever
the
hell
is
going
on
ill
put
up
another
bottle
in
the
future
but
as
it
is
stay
far
far
away
o
this
certainly
deserves
the
praise
it
gets
no
question
overall
a
nice
powerful
winter
warmer
save
for
cold
weather
and
drink
as
an
afterdinner
beer
o
amazing
all
around
this
is
a
musttry
medium
bodied
with
a
similar
amount
of
carbonation
that
creates
a
fairly
creamy
and
smoothflowing
mouthfeel
finish
is
quite
dry
with
plenty
of
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
highly
approachable
and
mysterious
in
an
uerige
flute
luring
one
to
seek
more
one
will
easily
look
forward
to
trying
this
with
smoked
cheeses
poured
a
deep
violet
no
real
head
is
produced
other
than
a
film
which
faded
about
halfway
through
the
glass
little
to
no
retention
and
some
modest
legs
nose
is
heavy
on
the
malt
sugary
dark
fruits
some
brown
sugar
and
dark
bread
although
resembling
a
sweet
fruity
doppelsticke
this
had
some
qualities
akin
to
what
reminded
me
of
a
similar
english
barleywine
call
me
crazy
taste
has
more
dark
fruits
figs
and
dates
still
lightly
sugary
bready
and
malty
as
heck
rich
dark
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
ton
of
herbal
and
spicy
hop
notes
in
the
finish
producing
the
same
dryness
and
bitterness
as
the
others
no
real
alcohol
on
the
palate
with
a
full
and
dense
body
sweet
with
a
very
low
carbonation
thats
a
shade
or
two
off
of
being
flat
a
big
sipper
for
the
winter
i
can
imagine
this
being
immaculate
on
draught
or
cask
o
rich
and
full
of
flavor
this
beer
has
a
great
balance
and
tons
of
character
not
too
sweet
and
not
to
dry
cheers
all
in
all
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
with
complex
and
refined
notes
and
lots
of
drinkability
i
am
again
highly
impressed
with
another
great
beer
from
uerige
i
give
it
an
a
unique
looking
bottle
i
thought
that
even
though
a
bit
big
for
the
style
that
this
was
excellent
recco
overall
great
example
of
the
style
but
also
a
little
pricey
one
i
would
try
again
mouthfeel
very
creamy
full
bodied
velvety
slight
astringency
in
the
finish
a
perfect
beer
to
savor
on
a
chilly
autumn
evening
highly
reccomended
m
d
this
dark
and
weighty
brew
with
hints
of
alcohol
slows
the
drinking
pace
the
co2
keeps
it
from
dragging
overall
an
expertly
crafted
beer
that
traveled
to
the
states
well
i
wish
the
bottle
which
will
be
perfect
for
future
use
in
homebrewing
was
larger
because
one
pint
might
not
be
enough
overall
great
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
and
very
distinct
needs
a
good
food
pairing
never
had
anything
like
it
and
i
enjoy
it
o
overall
its
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
and
would
also
recommend
it
to
others
i
cant
give
it
4
5
or
5
0
simply
because
it
wasnt
up
to
that
standard
but
it
is
a
solid
4
0
which
is
a
really
good
score
in
my
book
o
how
does
an
eight
year
old
altbier
taste
pretty
good
the
caramel
played
nicely
throughout
the
entire
beer
i
wonder
what
a
fresher
bottle
would
taste
like
d
a
superb
alt
reminds
me
of
adnams
broadside
lots
of
hop
and
malt
presence
that
balance
well
but
still
manage
to
hold
their
own
indivdual
characteristics
in
both
palate
and
nose
a
beer
to
warm
the
soul
oone
cannot
deny
that
this
is
damned
good
stuff
i
would
hazard
to
say
that
this
brew
is
the
benchmark
of
the
style
but
then
again
how
many
double
altbiers
do
you
see
i
really
need
to
track
down
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
to
see
if
the
age
has
detracted
or
not
overall
pretty
good
a
nice
dark
german
ale
with
some
nice
malts
hops
hint
of
booze
nice
fruits
and
tasty
overall
beer
finishes
sweet
with
a
little
ethanol
heat
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
an
interesting
beer
the
imperial
altness
is
not
quite
my
thing
on
this
hot
eve
but
i
can
see
its
vision
in
the
fall
a
glorious
glass
tempting
me
this
is
a
beautiful
alt
this
is
a
huge
beer
that
hides
its
size
wonderfully
it
balance
between
the
dark
and
sweet
malt
flavors
and
the
hoppy
undertones
marry
perfectly
this
is
a
wonderful
sipper
that
i
would
buy
again
without
hesitation
poured
a
hazy
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
nice
puff
of
offwhite
head
aroma
of
caramel
malts
and
dark
dried
fruit
with
some
musk
and
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
rich
and
flavorful
with
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
malts
raisins
and
fig
newtons
fresh
hops
earthy
with
a
slight
sensation
of
apple
peel
finishes
nice
and
dry
medium
mouthfeel
and
quite
a
pleasant
drink
medium
bodied
with
a
fine
but
soft
carbonation
this
is
a
delectable
dark
altbier
one
that
really
makes
the
german
style
shine
interesting
and
unique
beer
here
my
first
alt
so
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
it
the
smokey
elements
balance
the
pungent
fruit
and
malts
so
overall
im
enjoying
it
hides
its
strength
pretty
well
i
will
need
more
time
to
consider
this
but
for
now
i
say
its
pretty
good
but
not
for
everyone
this
caught
my
eye
because
the
unique
bottle
they
have
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
minimal
head
on
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
rich
malts
on
the
nose
theres
also
a
light
roasted
smell
to
the
beer
the
taste
has
a
nice
sweet
flavor
with
a
malty
dry
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
which
is
kind
of
nice
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
interesting
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
sometime
o
this
is
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
and
words
can
barely
do
it
justice
find
it
drink
it
be
grateful
to
be
alive
as
their
web
site
says
it
is
the
delicious
droplet
o
strange
brew
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
creamy
throughout
smooth
on
the
finish
with
a
chalky
dry
feeling
in
the
midpalate
fine
carbonation
allows
the
beer
to
dance
on
the
tongue
while
allowing
the
body
of
the
brew
to
shine
easy
to
drink
and
so
complex
that
i
cant
imagine
that
ive
caught
it
all
i
definitely
hope
to
return
to
this
soon
served
from
bottle
into
a
mother
earth
strange
poured
a
massively
dark
amber
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
caramel
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
caramel
sweet
alcohol
and
honey
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
it
was
very
well
balanced
despite
having
quite
a
bit
going
on
the
aroma
was
not
very
strong
but
was
still
quite
good
after
you
worked
to
find
it
i
would
have
never
guessed
that
the
alcohol
was
this
high
on
this
one
as
the
sweetness
aspect
of
this
brew
hides
it
quite
well
a
definite
must
try
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
nose
is
sweet
and
bready

of

cherry
molasses
toffee
bread
followed
by
a
bit
of
cocoa

finish

nice
and

almost
roasty
plenty
of
bite
a
hint
of
booze
as
well
slightly
thinner
body
complex
flavor
silky
mouthfeel
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
wish
i
had
gotten
a
few
more
its
a
style
i
dont
normally
gravitate
to
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
reminded
me
a
little
of
an
imperial
stout
with
the
complex
robust
flavors
halfway
through
the
glass
i
was
wishing
i
had
bought
more
than
one
sampled
on
april
30
2011
there
was
a
code
on
the
label
that
i
simply
could
not
read
but
i
think
it
had
a
couple
of
zeroes
in
it
it
has
a
gorgeous
reddishmahogany
brown
pour
with
a
longlasting
foamy
head
and
seltzer
waterlike
carbonation
the
malt
aroma
is
overwhelming
it
is
sweet
like
molasses
and
sharp
like
licorice
oh
and
did
i
say
it
was
malty
it
really
tingles
my
tongue
with
its
sweet
malty
toffee
taste
and
its
dry
bite
stabbing
me
at
the
end
i
also
thought
the
bottle
was
kind
of
neat
poors
a
mahogany
brown
big
malty
aroma
roasted
carmel
toffee
sticky
sweetness
almost
like
maple
syrup
or
creme
brulee
mouthfeel
is
rich
almost
a
bit
too
sweetcloying
overall
good
trying
to
get
into
the
german
styles
after
assaulting
my
pallet
with
ipas
and
stouts
for
years
a
good
start
o
good
but
not
great
ill
probably
chose
to
spend
my
money
elsewhere
in
the
future
o
very
very
pleasant
smooth
well
balanced
more
hoppy
than
i
would
have
thought
but
def
a
brew
to
give
a
shot
yay
germany
draft
sampled
at
kickbacks
served
in
a
snifter
glass
and
pours
a
dark
murky
reddish
mahagony
brown
color
with
a
rich
tan
head
some
lace
ive
never
smelled
an
altbier
like
this
rich
aroma
of
dark
fruit
raisin
and
plum
with
some
caramel
notes
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
caramel
notes
off
the
bat
along
with
the
mentioned
dark
fruit
notes
some
roasted
flavors
creep
into
the
flavor
as
well
fairly
complex
booze
shows
slightly
and
ends
with
a
lingering
bitterness
drinkability
again
this
beer
defines
umami
it
is
so
delicious
because
it
covers
so
many
flavor
components
and
covers
them
all
very
well
it
is
complex
fruity
sweet
bitter
and
german
this
is
the
best
german
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
it
rivals
many
of
the
overall
beers
i
have
ever
had
as
close
to
perfection
as
it
gets
the
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
substantial
and
even
sticky
o
not
my
favorite
dont
really
like
the
flavor
of
aged
brews
old
ales
etc
as
this
was
an
aged
version
of
an
altbier
doppelsticke
it
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
however
considering
the
style
of
beer
it
is
it
was
very
well
done
and
remained
true
to
its
characteristics
notes
hmm
high
bracket
for
the
style
i
have
not
had
many
altbiers
but
all
ive
had
before
this
was
forgettable
this
is
on
an
entirely
different
league
nice
complex
treat
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
for
an
8
50
abv
beer
the
aftertaste
is
both
bitter
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
a
good
beer
which
was
a
nice
treat
to
find
at
zipps
liquors
pours
yields
a
deep
molassescolored
brew
with
a
good
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
lacing
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
a
spotty
fashion
the
nose
is
incredibly
rich
with
dark
fruits
molasses
brown
sugar
and
some
caramel
its
nearly
a
cross
between
a
doppelbock
and
an
eisbock
really
insanely
enjoyable
the
flavor
doesnt
back
down
presenting
a
really
nice
fruity
presence
along
with
a
touch
of
booze
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
but
fails
a
bit
in
the
finish
good
medium
body
presents
itself
well
but
theres
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
in
the
finish
wiping
away
the
beautiful
flavor
really
quite
drinkable
a
solid
hit
on
the
best
of
germany
list
d
sweet
fruity
and
full
of
chocolate
not
bad
definitely
interesting
ill
have
to
seek
out
more
beers
from
this
style
and
from
this
brewery
the
taste
surprised
me
a
lot
with
what
i
conceived
of
as
a
plumish
spice
a
bit
of
wheat
smoothed
the
beer
out
after
the
plum
but
then
came
the
alcohol
taste
followed
by
some
malty
sweetness
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
although
it
isnt
my
style
it
certainly
tested
my
palette
and
was
surprising
enough
to
impress
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
flavor
even
if
i
cannot
describe
it
properly
and
is
a
full
bodied
beer
i
like
everything
about
this
beer
even
down
do
the
funky
gasket
bottle
im
definitely
going
to
be
picking
up
another
one
of
these
so
this
is
definitely
not
my
first
german
beer
and
definitely
not
my
last
germans
can
make
a
great
glass
of
bubbly
brew
my
local
beer
store
is
selling
these
for
5
99
a
bottle
pick
one
up
bottled
on
0603
which
means
this
is
8
years
old
dark
mahogany
color
creamy
head
sweet
smell
of
malts
supposedly
this
is
an
altbier
but
it
smells
like
a
dopplebock
taste
is
great
and
exceptional
fruits
maybe
raisins
nice
caramel
malts
and
a
great
sweet
brew
outstanding
d
too
rich
for
more
than
the
one
pint
but
i
would
love
to
have
this
as
an
afterdinner
snack
drinkability
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
easy
to
drink
and
complex
a
bit
of
a
mouth
takeover
in
its
flavor
and
mouthfeel
it
seems
to
coat
everything
that
it
touches
delightful
but
not
sessionable
this
beer
makes
me
wish
to
get
in
touch
with
more
alt
style
beers
d
tasty
and
interesting
not
my
favorite
thing
in
the
world
but
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
a
great
example
of
a
style
which
doesnt
exist
imperial
altbiers
are
really
basically
doppelbocks
with
ale
yeast
but
this
is
really
great
regardless
of
what
you
call
it
thankfully
it
comes
in
an
11
oz
bottle
so
you
can
ration
yourself
and
not
have
to
take
an
early
nap
this
beer
should
be
on
every
beer
geeks
bucket
list
drinkability
this
one
is
delicious
id
love
to
sip
and
savor
but
its
too
good
drinkability
at
7
for
a
500ml
bottle
combined
with
the
fact
that
this
is
a
sipper
i
gave
this
one
a
grade
of
3
on
drinkability
very
different
beverage
when
compared
to
the
pinkus
altbier
which
is
the
only
other
entrant
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
good
beer
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
plumbrown
color
with
not
too
much
head
you
can
smell
the
concentrated
altbier
on
the
nostrils
the
extreme
malty
bready
and
boozy
aroma
in
this
case
creates
a
very
strong
example
of
the
style
for
my
money
its
a
bit
too
intense
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
a
kind
of
rum
booze
mixed
with
some
roasted
wheat
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
sticky
for
my
liking
and
this
is
still
a
good
drinking
beer
if
you
want
to
experience
the
style
in
all
its
glory
theres
no
reason
you
shouldnt
get
this
beer
in
short
a
complex
fruity
bitter
yet
malty
lagered
ale
md
strong
warming
abv
surprisingly
drinkable
i
honestly
didnt
like
it
at
first
i
think
because
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
is
balanced
complex
full
of
ingredients
unique
and
interesting
d
this
is
a
might
tasty
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
rather
well
it
has
great
flavor
and
it
is
a
nice
intro
for
me
into
altbiers
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
two
fingers
of
tan
head
this
beer
is
a
murky
brown
color
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
raisins
and
prunes
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
too
the
taste
is
sweet
and
contains
the
aforementioned
raisins
and
prunes
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
alcohol
the
roasted
malt
lingers
as
i
work
on
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
most
this
is
my
first
beer
in
this
style
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
probably
try
this
again
and
look
forward
to
exploring
more
examples
of
altbier
d
meal
in
a
bottle
cliche
applies
more
than
ever
here
i
felt
the
booze
but
it
was
totally
worthwhile
i
dont
think
im
a
big
fan
of
uerige
beers
as
this
is
my
second
mediocre
reaction
to
them
drinkability
dangerously
drinkable
at
8
5
abv
the
alcohol
says
sip
but
the
flavor
says
keep
it
coming
plain
delicious
taste
is
frruity
raisiny
lightly
spicey
with
brown
bread
rich
while
wheat
bread
light
sweetnes
and
a
nutty
maple
hint
it
has
a
lot
of
character
great
complexity
and
balance
and
everything
is
well
integrated
feel
is
firm
and
somewhat
lively
it
is
exceedingly
drinkable
the
beer
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
ton
of
caramel
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
earthy
hops
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
caramel
malt
earth
and
dirty
hops
chocolate
malt
and
smoke
the
alcohol
is
fairly
noticeable
and
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
is
low
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
dexceptional
drinkability
smooth
and
wellbalanced
no
real
sign
of
this
beers
true
abv
impression
absolutely
the
star
of
an
evening
of
great
alts
try
this
one
and
you
will
be
an
alt
fan
too
d
an
outstanding
experience
d
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
because
it
has
a
good
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
but
its
a
sipping
beer
and
theres
no
way
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
o
good
heavy
and
would
only
want
a
small
pour
of
it
but
very
good
the
bottle
flet
like
a
small
meal
but
clearly
worth
it
i
kept
the
bottle
just
because
it
looked
cool
id
say
one
of
the
best
beers
of
its
type
looks
like
the
bottle
mustve
cost
at
least
a
dollar
da
malt
monster
this
one
is
for
true
grainiacs
a
little
too
sweet
for
drinking
by
itself
but
would
make
an
excellent
food
or
dessert
beer
d
this
was
a
blind
impulse
purchase
i
tried
and
loved
an
american
made
barrel
aged
dopplesticke
plus
i
liked
the
cool
bottle
what
a
fantastic
experience
rich
and
decadent
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
thick
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
deep
complex
and
rich
dark
fruit
such
as
figs
and
dates
primarily
with
an
underlying
caramel
sweetness
flavor
is
rich
and
sweet
not
as
fruity
in
flavor
as
was
the
aroma
more
of
a
carmel
sweetness
complimented
by
a
dark
bread
flavor
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
near
the
finish
some
hop
bitterness
helps
balance
the
sweetness
finally
a
touch
of
alcohol
warmth
at
the
end
a
big
body
that
i
have
not
experienced
in
an
altbier
before
chewey
texture
this
beer
feels
like
a
meal
in
itself
am
i
in
dusseldorf
has
the
old
world
taste
that
just
does
not
get
duplicated
here
in
the
states
d
goes
down
easily
quite
tasty
well
done
somewhat
filling
though
because
of
the
lingering
sweetness
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
d
certainly
one
of
the
maltiest
beers
ive
ever
had
any
fan
of
dopplebocks
or
english
barleywine
should
try
this
its
kind
of
a
hybrid
tending
more
towards
the
dopplebock
side
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
syrupy
chewy
slick
and
warming
upfront
flavors
of
dates
raisins
toast
brown
sugar
and
spice
theres
a
faint
mineal
twang
peppery
spice
a
bit
of
alcohol
complex
but
nicely
balanced
malty
but
not
especially
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
almost
syrupy
and
the
finish
is
peppery
and
dry
this
is
awesome
stuff
i
liked
it
a
great
deal
and
am
very
pleased
to
have
at
last
tasted
one
of
these
beers
overall
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
id
still
love
to
find
ueriges
regular
sticke
and
regular
altbier
but
ive
never
seen
them
in
stores
11
2
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
reddishbrown
color
with
a
decent
frothy
lightbrown
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
roasted
malts
caramel
and
a
hint
of
wood
flavor
is
sweet
fruity
licorice
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
earthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
oily
flat
bitter
and
slightly
alcoholic
very
complex
beer
more
of
a
barleywine
than
an
alt
lots
of
flavors
well
balanced
warms
well
and
probably
ages
well
if
style
points
for
a
cool
bottle
were
available
id
award
some
here
this
was
my
first
experience
wiht
this
substyle
so
i
dont
have
any
frame
of
reference
but
it
was
certainly
interesting
dark
caramel
pour
slightly
turbid
malt
flavor
of
toffee
and
caramel
followed
closely
by
a
slightly
tangy
note
that
was
not
quite
sour
finished
with
bittering
without
characteristics
of
any
particular
hops
varietal
good
stuff
a
bit
more
challenging
than
something
like
double
bag
but
much
more
rewarding
d
alcohol
fairly
well
hidden
will
have
to
try
the
regular
and
single
sticke
versions
next
for
all
the
rich
malt
the
beer
is
pretty
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
full
smooth
and
sticky
with
a
lower
moderate
level
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
an
eyeopener
and
id
say
it
is
to
alts
what
a
weizenbock
is
to
a
hefe
everything
is
intense
rich
and
powerful
not
a
beer
to
be
messed
with
but
one
id
love
to
have
a
case
of
seriously
good
stuff
thanks
bobsy
nice
and
dark
the
head
quickly
disappears
after
pouring
the
smell
is
mouthwatering
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
taste
to
come
malty
and
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
this
coats
the
mouth
and
fills
the
stomach
a
musthave
for
dark
german
beer
lovers
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
finish
a
whole
bottle
of
this
beer
and
i
imagine
it
is
presented
in
small
pours
fairly
regularly
that
said
it
was
a
truly
enjoyable
sipper
and
i
was
happy
to
try
this
lovely
example
of
the
altbier
style
really
impressed
with
this
beer
ill
be
buying
another
to
store
in
the
beer
cellar
bet
this
will
mellow
nicely
if
rested
for
a
few
years
all
in
all
this
is
a
beer
that
is
rich
bold
flavorful
and
tastes
great
what
more
could
you
ask
for
overall
feels
much
stronger
than
abv
more
bite
than
i
prefer
utopias
probably
drinks
better
this
beer
really
surprised
me
which
is
odd
because
i
didnt
really
have
expectations
first
its
dry
but
smooth
the
first
thing
i
taste
is
the
malt
this
really
is
a
malt
bomb
but
it
doesnt
stop
there
the
midpalate
there
are
these
odd
spices
i
cant
really
identify
them
but
they
are
definitely
there
its
a
difficult
combination
of
flavors
but
it
keeps
me
drinking
the
spice
is
followed
by
a
short
and
really
bright
round
flavor
that
if
it
lasted
any
longer
would
be
unpleasant
but
it
is
cut
short
by
the
back
of
the
mouth
dryness
the
dryness
causes
this
beer
to
finish
completely
mouthfeel
is
great
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
not
sure
i
could
drink
very
many
of
these
d
a
different
take
on
the
doppelbock
worth
looking
into
if
doppels
are
your
thing
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
it
sticks
to
your
mouth
for
minutes
not
very
drinkable
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
this
has
to
be
the
stronger
altbier
ive
tried
and
i
thought
ngs
alt
was
out
of
character
that
said
the
alcohol
presence
was
quite
in
your
face
i
imagine
this
is
one
beer
that
would
definitely
benefit
from
aging
if
i
ever
find
any
bottles
of
it
taht
is
what
i
intend
to
do
tasty
and
enjoyable
topnotch
for
the
style
d
decent
despite
the
intense
palate
because
this
beer
is
really
tasty
deep
brown
with
reddish
highlights
thin
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
leafy
and
lemony
hops
dominate
the
nose
with
bright
citrus
contrasting
the
malt
depth
thats
excellent
wildflower
honey
burnt
caramel
dark
wheat
bread
excellent
on
the
palate
it
opens
with
a
great
combination
and
contrast
of
lemony
earthy
bitterness
and
honey
and
caramel
ive
never
had
this
beer
this
fresh
dark
german
wheat
bread
with
a
mild
spiciness
almost
ryelike
thats
probably
a
combination
of
the
hops
the
malt
and
the
alcohol
fruity
with
plums
and
raisins
excellent
stuff
medium
in
body
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
long
lasting
finish
with
bitterness
and
honey
sweetness
great
stuff
i
must
confess
that
i
couldnt
drink
too
much
of
it
but
that
was
probably
a
result
of
the
environment
in
which
i
drank
it
d
as
drinkable
as
i
would
expect
8
5
to
be
not
one
that
i
am
looking
to
gulp
so
i
will
be
enjoying
this
for
awhile
sessionability
im
thinking
you
need
to
be
in
alaska
or
siberia
to
session
this
beer
mfd
feel
is
a
medium
heavy
body
with
an
amazing
creaminess
carbonation
is
perfect
just
enough
to
make
the
beer
incredibly
drinkable
the
only
thing
affecting
the
drinkability
is
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
but
it
is
still
a
rock
solid
amazing
brew
while
it
is
kinda
alcoholic
i
have
to
say
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
like
it
some
similarities
to
an
eisenbock
or
a
strong
ale
but
lighter
than
either
variety
a
little
underwhelming
but
a
decent
beer
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different

if
you
like

sweeter

beers
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
id
definitely
buy
this
again
future
outlook
good
stuff
very
reminiscent
of
drinking
a
barleywine
id
be
happy
to
have
again
up
to
the
finish
its
difficult
to
believe
that
this
could
come
from
an
alt
base
it
seems
much
more
like
a
delicious
barleywine
than
a
strong
derivative
of
altbier
absolutely
delicious
its
quite
understandable
why
this
beer
is
brewed
for
the
american
market
as
it
doesnt
fit
in
with
the
vast
majority
of
german
beer
styles
with
only
eisbock
or
strong
bocks
such
as
samichlaus
even
coming
close
in
terms
of
palatal
characteristics
being
a
good
american
bierliebhaber
i
could
definitely
use
another
soon
drinkability
is
high
here
but
for
the
fact
i
have
never
seen
this
at
all
kane
says
he
might
be
able
to
acquire
this
one
hope
he
does
d
this
is
definitely
a
one
beer
for
the
evening
brew
this
is
not
a
sessions
beer
though
i
do
like
the
thinness
to
allow
for
seconds
its
just
too
sweet
i
could
do
more
of
these
if
i
was
eating
something
salty
to
balance
out
the
sweet
of
the
malt
d
not
very
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
id
have
a
hard
time
drinking
more
than
one
great
sticke
bier
overall
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
an
altbier
though
i
understand
it
was
a
bit
beefed
up
for
the
american
market
regardless
its
well
worth
a
shot
d
this
one
hides
the
abv
extraordinarily
well
not
one
i
would
session
yet
easy
to
drink
all
the
same
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
one
for
sure
almost
viscous
but
not
overly
syrupy
astringency
in
the
middle
and
on
into
the
finish
light
to
moderate
carbonation
provides
tingle
and
complements
the
light
syrup
feel
overall
very
good
complex
and
malty
beer
reminiscent
of
a
dopplebock
with
a
hoppy
finish
definitely
a
sipper
a
few
would
be
ok
but
more
than
2
of
these
and
i
would
be
out
good
to
enjoy
one
or
two
during
a
nice
setting
m
medium
bodied
a
little
chewy
well
carbonated
have
this
beer
bathed
and
brought
to
my
chamber
dont
think
its
any
better
or
worst
than
that
lighter
one
certainly
another
world
all
together
i
appreciate
the
uerige
sticke
on
the
basis
that
it
is
so
complex
and
so
light
in
comparison
pours
a
clear
dark
amberbrown
with
a
smallish
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
caramel
malts
and
brown
sugar
along
with
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
tastes
of
caramel
raisin
and
toffee
overall
pretty
molasseslike
spice
and
alcohol
warmth
finish
it
out
thick
quasisyrupy
body
this
isnt
even
reminiscent
of
the
classic
alt
a
bit
too
big
for
its
own
good
d
if
you
like
altbiers
this
is
one
for
you
this
isnt
necessarily
one
id
return
to
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
camalized
malt
toffee
with
hints
of
herbal
hops
the
taste
has
the
malty
tones
of
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
a
firm
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
nicely
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
makes
me
wish
there
were
more
doppelsticke
altbiers
out
there
aroma
is
full
of
raisins
malt
deep
dark
fruit
very
winey
and
complex
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
outstanding
surprising
for
an
alt
in
its
rich
fruitiness
recalls
a
great
belgian
quad
in
the
multilayered
malty
and
fruity
complexity
wonderful
to
savor
and
sad
when
its
gonehence
wonderfully
drinakble
must
try
this
again
nice
and
slightly
viscous
on
the
tongue
very
pleasant
overall
and
an
excellent
beer
d
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
overall
and
that
does
hinder
this
category
a
tad
the
big
malty
flavors
really
work
well
with
the
finished
product
at
times
the
alcohol
also
seems
to
fade
a
little
and
let
this
beer
shine
i
can
see
having
another
one
of
these
in
a
session
but
that
would
be
about
it
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
out
for
the
abv
range
its
not
the
best
and
the
taste
is
heavy
enough
that
id
probably
not
want
too
many
in
a
row
but
i
could
drink
this
on
a
more
regular
basis
if
it
werent
so
expensive
this
beer
pours
brown
with
a
2
fingered
light
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
nice
toasted
malts
the
flavor
is
ver
deep
some
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
tons
of
malt
very
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
smooth
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
a
highly
drinkable
brew
minus
the
price
it
poured
up
a
very
cloudy
dark
reddish
brown
colour
with
a
sandy
coloured
foamy
cap
smell
is
quite
nice
with
notes
of
sweet
cereals
about
a
dozen
breakfast
cereals
come
to
mind
a
bit
of
caramel
some
fruity
aromas
that
i
cant
quite
pin
down
and
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
brown
sugar
these
sweet
profiles
in
the
smell
are
represented
in
the
flavour
as
well
along
with
a
surprising
earthy
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
about
where
it
should
be
for
the
style
especially
considering
the
abv
carbonation
while
certainly
present
is
modest
and
pleasant
this
is
a
well
crafted
alt
and
seems
to
be
wonderfully
balanced
im
very
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
interesting
i
really
liked
this
beer
on
cask
and
in
bottle
but
on
draft
the
hoppy
bitterness
was
a
bit
more
then
i
would
have
liked
still
a
good
solid
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
an
awesome
beer
tons
of
flavor
and
character
one
of
the
great
german
ales
this
is
by
far
the
best
alt
i
have
had
very
glad
i
picked
it
up
poured
out
of
a
very
unique
bottle
this
beer
is
about
the
color
of
a
glass
of
coke
as
i
got
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
small
protein
particles
were
noticeable
it
smells
malty
and
bready
and
the
same
goes
for
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
raisin
its
different
from
any
altbier
ive
had
it
tastes
more
like
a
doppelbock
overall
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
its
good
but
i
dont
know
if
id
go
out
searching
for
it
again
id
reach
for
a
quality
doppelbock
instead
very
different
than
the
american
altbiers
im
familiar
with
lots
going
on
here
definitely
a
sipper
i
love
the
aroma
of
bread
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
was
great
as
well
my
only
mark
is
the
alcohol
is
very
pronounced
bringing
the
drinkability
down
wow
a
very
complex
brew
very
unique
as
it
hits
on
quite
a
few
styles
a
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
this
was
my
second
time
having
this
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
the
first
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
couple
of
millimeters
thick
it
has
very
good
carbonation
and
very
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
unlike
anything
i
have
had
before
malty
and
bready
at
first
with
hints
of
bittersweet
fruit
on
the
backbone
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
very
nice
it
starts
with
a
sweet
malt
profile
but
that
tapers
off
to
a
dry
fruity
hop
finish
that
stays
on
the
palate
although
it
has
a
higher
abv
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
is
very
elegant
as
it
hits
the
tongue
uerige
doppelsticke
is
a
very
good
brew
and
would
make
a
great
afterdinner
beer
i
couldnt
even
begin
to
try
to
pair
this
with
any
specific
cuisine
this
bottle
was
part
of
a
funky
beer
run
for
me
and
this
lived
up
to
my
expectations
a
real
treat
a
sipper
for
sure
because
of
density
of
flavors
body
and
boozy
kick
but
it
was
a
one
and
done
type
of
beer
no
way
i
could
have
2
in
a
row
im
not
that
gluttonous
get
this
in
the
cooler
weather
and
curl
up
and
enjoy
very
very
good
drink
a
very
good
beer
very
strong
yet
hidden
well
considering
not
by
any
means
anything
but
sipping
beer
but
very
good
intriguing
beer
of
the
style
very
complex
and
enjoyable
out
of
a
nifty
swingtop
bottle
this
sticke
beer
a
more
punchy
version
of
an
altbier
was
a
very
dark
nearly
opaque
mahoganycopper
color
the
head
was
one
finger
of
fine
beige
bubbles
that
retained
themselves
well
as
a
collar
and
left
streaks
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
blend
of
very
fruity
esters
raisins
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
yeast
and
a
little
alcohol
the
flavors
were
excellent
very
similar
to
a
belgian
dark
ale
rich
and
sweet
i
tasted
lots
of
caramel
malt
and
toffee
first
then
dark
fruit
sweetness
especially
of
golden
raisins
and
figs
followed
by
alcohol
heat
yeast
and
wheat
with
a
semibitter
hoppy
finish
though
it
started
sweet
the
elements
at
the
end
really
balanced
it
out
beautifully
the
mouthfeel
was
silky
the
carbonation
delicate
but
not
at
all
flat
and
the
body
mediumfull
this
beer
really
felt
luxurious
and
the
8
5
was
well
blended
into
the
complex
flavors
i
have
no
problem
saying
it
i
think
this
is
the
best
altbier
i
have
ever
had
and
definitely
one
of
if
not
the
best
in
the
world
im
new
to
alts
if
this
is
what
they
are
all
about
im
in
this
beer
has
a
dark
character
but
doesnt
go
too
far
smokey
cedarwood
mellow
fruits
and
vanilla
slighty
sticky
with
mild
carbonation
maybe
just
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
but
still
very
drinkable
on
tap
at
papago
ruby
tinted
brown
shade
of
black
with
a
huge
puffy
off
white
head
additional
aromas
of
fresh
cherries
and
maple
syrup
added
to
the
prior
review
lots
of
spice
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
creep
in
on
the
palate
as
it
warms
any
sugar
previously
tasted
from
the
bottle
is
no
issue
and
really
nowhere
roasty
bitterness
and
fresh
hoppy
dryness
really
clean
it
up
nicely
full
rich
body
with
a
luscious
creamy
mouth
feel

its
always
hard
to
review
a
beer
when
you
have
no
experience
with
the
style
this
being
my
first
altbier
i
would
say
it
was
pretty
good
and
i
look
forward
to
finding
some
other
examples
assuming
my
memory
holds
up
this
tastes
and
smells
mighty
close
to
arrogant
bastard
ale
to
my
untrained
tastebuds
and
nostrils
a
short
review
with
equivalent
ratings
to
my
aba
review
pricey
but
tasty
d
the
mouthfeel
alone
makes
this
beer
easy
enough
to
finish
in
a
few
gulps
luckily
uerige
doppelsticke
possess
an
extremely
different
and
unique
character
as
well
nothing
short
of
greatness
i
only
wish
i
had
more
of
it
to
drink
d
different
than
virtually
any
altbier
ive
tried
before
packs
much
more
wallop
pervasively
warming
you
have
to
know
what
you
are
getting
into
if
you
are
jumping
into
these
you
feel
every
drop
and
it
was
a
pleasure
overall
a
powerfully
strong
and
rich
beer
well
made
there
is
no
roasted
character
in
the
beer
but
there
a
good
level
of
bitterness
the
malt
surrounds
the
noble
hops
in
turn
providing
a
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
astringent
but
clean
and
spicywarm
full
bodied
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
the
beer
the
finish
is
a
bit
nutty
and
lingers
on
the
palate
allowing
the
drinker
to
reflect
on
the
style
of
the
beer
i
love
the
bottle
and
dont
want
to
throw
it
away
i
wish
for
serving
type
there
was
an
option
for
coolass
bottle
this
bottle
was
very
unique
pours
a
clear
dark
dark
amber
with
creamy
1
finger
head
retention
and
lacing
were
minimal
though
smell
was
strong
of
caramel
and
raisin
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
was
complex
but
this
was
a
malt
bomb
if
you
ask
me
when
it
was
cooler
i
did
notice
a
slight
bitterness
but
as
it
waremed
it
was
all
caramel
malt
with
some
sweetness
some
dark
fruit
and
some
toasted
grain
mouuthfeel
was
fine
mediumish
or
so
reminded
me
a
little
of
a
dopplebock
overall
a
good
beer
definitely
a
slow
sipper
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
noticable
in
this
beer
which
lends
it
to
slow
sippin
i
will
try
this
again
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
as
far
as
the
experience
didnt
live
up
the
expectations
i
really
liked
this
funny
little
beer
this
doppelsticke
fun
name
to
boot
its
like
a
cross
between
an
english
barleywine
nils
oscar
comes
to
mind
as
i
tried
it
recently
and
a
doppelbock
think
korbinian
very
sweet
doughy
malt
but
with
a
ton
of
fruity
tang
and
a
mildly
sticky
feel
the
flavor
is
mostly
sweet
doughy
malt
it
has
a
vinous
and
nearbrandy
quality
its
not
as
rich
as
a
straight
malt
bomb
there
is
a
much
more
delicate
quality
particularly
in
a
fruity
yeast
ripe
plums
and
bananas
and
mineral
to
earthy
hops
i
guess
there
are
probably
sweet
notes
of
caramel
and
chocolate
lurking
but
the
sweetness
comes
through
more
in
a
barleywine
flavor
than
most
highly
malty
styles
the
beer
is
a
bit
sticky
sweet
dont
get
me
wrong
i
certainly
wouldnt
recommend
this
as
a
session
beer
in
fact
it
may
be
getting
more
difficult
to
drink
as
i
go
through
the
bottle
its
a
lot
of
sweetness
that
said
i
would
very
much
enjoy
having
a
case
of
these
to
open
whenever
i
was
in
the
mood
doppelsticke
is
a
funny
beer
and
i
may
rarely
be
in
the
mood
for
it
but
its
excellent
in
certain
circumstances
also
it
does
not
seem
to
fulfill
the
characteristics
of
the
style
but
i
imagine
the
brewery
is
aware
of
this
fact
and
doesnt
mind
being
somewhat
unique
also
the
bottle
is
wonderfully
almost
clichédly
german
d
tough
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
i
much
prefer
the
alt
doesnt
do
it
for
me
at
all
this
was
a
great
beer
i
thought
it
was
outstanding
and
what
all
altbiers
should
aspire
to
be
served
from
cask
at
redlight
redlight
in
orlando
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
fluffy
head
that
leavs
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
mug
smell
is
amazing
roasted
malt
berry
nectar
sweet
fig
and
nuts
there
was
alot
going
on
in
this
brew
the
taste
was
amazing
sweet
fig
with
layers
of
bread
chocolate
earth
stickiness
and
a
amazing
hop
finish
that
left
it
all
balance
out
this
beer
was
like
nothing
i
have
had
before
very
complex
warm
and
amazing
with
each
sip
tasting
different
flavors
of
sweet
goodness
this
was
such
a
wonderful
experience
that
i
will
always
remeber
this
beer
was
simply
out
of
this
world
thick
and
viscous
very
little
carbonation
ill
be
looking
for
more
and
pretty
damn
interested
in
trying
the
other
alts
from
uerige
deep
amber
in
color
with
a
ruby
hue
and
medium
off
white
head
decent
retention
for
a
big
alt
such
as
this
one
smell
is
rich
of
sweet
malts
lots
of
fruity
sweetness
with
raisin
fig
and
cherry
some
toffee
and
light
caramel
also
a
faint
toasted
bread
taste
is
pretty
nice
good
fruit
flavors
and
again
rich
in
sweetness
a
light
spicy
heat
is
also
present
and
possibly
a
spritz
of
citrus
mouthfeel
is
mostly
smooth
and
silky
but
a
bit
syrupy
at
times
pretty
full
in
body
for
the
style
still
its
pretty
drinkable
not
so
much
as
others
but
interesting
either
way
its
good
but
not
one
that
ill
seek
out
often
pours
a
cloudy
brown
almost
cocoa
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
fades
qickly
without
leaving
any
lacing
week
aroma
that
is
malty
with
some
hops
a
little
watered
down
for
my
taste
abv
well
hidden
with
a
nice
balance
of
maltiness
and
hops
s
well
as
a
slight
nutty
caramel
presence
d
drinks
much
bigger
and
bitter
then
others
by
style
and
really
stands
out
mfd
although
i
believe
the
bottle
i
sampled
may
have
been
long
pasted
its
prime
it
was
still
pretty
decent
i
will
definately
try
this
one
again
paying
a
little
more
attention
to
the
best
before
date
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
brown
in
color
with
no
head
forming
on
the
pour
another
beer
in
clean
out
the
designated
beer
fridge
08
smell
is
very
toffee
like
with
a
shit
ton
of
caramel
malts
taste
is
even
more
of
the
toffee
and
caramel
malts
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
dark
smooth
beer
very
well
done
this
is
something
that
i
could
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
very
nice
d
this
is
odd
i
dont
know
about
this
beer
i
want
to
drink
more
of
it
to
get
a
better
idea
but
dont
know
how
much
i
could
this
is
a
different
beer
i
like
it
but
i
dont
know
what
exactly
to
think
of
it
definitely
an
interesting
beer
though
definitely
a
sipper
easily
drinkable
but
works
best
if
savoring
in
small
doses
welldone
a
nice
wellbalanced
thick
tasty
german
beer
the
rich
creamy
body
of
uerige
dopplesticke
starts
with
candied
caramel
malts
and
quickly
transitions
to
layers
of
dark
musky
fruit
and
bitter
powdered
chocolate
very
impressive
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
even
better
with
a
velvety
smooth
texture
that
balances
perfectly
with
a
peppery
spicy
kiss
of
hops
at
the
finish
the
carbonation
level
is
perfect
keeping
the
body
from
becoming
too
viscous
and
syrupy
truly
a
phenomenal
beverage
highly
recommended
this
is
the
first
alt
i
have
ever
tried
though
its
more
like
a
doppelbock
i
think
i
am
gonna
have
to
try
and
seek
out
more
in
this
style
as
it
is
quite
good

the

on

is
hard
to

but
it
looks
like
it
says

pours
a
cloudy
medium
dark
brown
with
a
1

head
ok
longevity
and
ok
lace
big
malt
aromas
mixed
with
caramel

big
malt
flavors
too
again
mixed
with
caramel
sherry
and
a
yeasty
chocolate
flavor
higher
than
expected
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
while
alcohol
is
present
and
this
is
a
definate
sipping
beer
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
but
is
a
real
sipper
not
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
drank
this
at
about
50f
which
seemed
close
to
right
as
a
fan
primarily
of
darker
brews
i
enjoyed
this
drink
quite
a
bit
it
pours
a
deep
brown
like
cola
with
a
thin
tan
head
not
much
aroma
there
but
detectable
hints
of
sweetness
taste
has
a
fruity
sweetness
with
mainly
fig
in
it
like
a
fig
newton
but
also
apple
and
pear
i
found
the
taste
very
interesting
in
fact
i
was
not
aware
that
the
drink
is
an
altbier
i
thought
it
was
a
fruity
variation
on
a
dopplebock
the
appearance
and
word
dopplesticke
probably
encourages
this
idea
as
well
the
malt
sweetness
was
subtle
but
present
with
a
hint
of
espresso
mouth
is
medium
thick
and
finishes
clean
with
a
very
faint
enjoyable
aftertaste
of
fig
subtle
carbonation
almost
like
a
stout
its
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
sip
doesnt
feel
like
its
weighing
you
down
though
i
could
see
the
sweetness
becoming
overwhelming
even
with
the
extra
bit
of
alcohol
content
this
is
very
drinkable
a
very
tasty
brew
here
if
you
ever
see
it
try
it
its
worth
it
ill
try
it
again
but
maybe
ill
look
for
a
fresher
example
next
time
cool
bottle
though
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
but
dense
brown
head
that
dissipated
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
caramel
malt
fig
raisinsdates
and
a
bit
of
spice
similar
to
an
old
ale
the
taste
is
grainy
lightly
roasted
molasses
red
wine
an
odd
lemony
twang
and
rust
not
what
i
expected
from
the
aroma
the
feel
is
well
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
slightly
sticky
with
a
stale
hop
bitterness
a
malty
beverage
for
sure
but
it
seems
past
its
prime
though
im
not
sure
that
it
is
has
both
good
and
bad
characteristics
its
ok
not
sure
i
would
seek
out
again
a
wonderful
little
treat
if
i
ever
find
a
fresher
bottle
i
will
be
sure
to
update
my
review
very
interesting
flavor
profile
its
part
alt
part
doppelbock
and
part
bitter
i
have
to
wonder
if
something
like
this
influenced
all
the
india
brown
ales
we
see
nowadays
tasted
on
41908
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
dont
think
it
quite
fits
the
altbier
style
where
bjcplike
styles
are
concerned
but
its
a
very
tasty
strong
ale
version
of
an
altbier
oxidation
clouds
what
this
beer
originally
tasted
like
when
it
was
fresh
which
was
probably
really
fantastic
but
it
doesnt
spoil
the
experience
at
all
dnot
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
beer
tough
to
drink
and
enjoy
the
balance
is
just
not
their
and
nothing
seems
to
blend
well
a
bit
disappointing
bought
it
because
i
like
altbiers
and
thought
a
double
secret
alt
would
be
even
better
nope
bigger
is
not
better
some
styles
dont
amp
up
well
maybe
the
beer
has
a
rich
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
lacing
swirl
it
around
and
the
lacing
thickens
up
nicely
extra
points
for
the
cool
bottle
with
the
fliptop
lid
the
aroma
is
faint
but
its
there
and
its
flavorful
the
taste
is
astounding
such
a
rich
pure
fullbodied
beer
taste
that
tickles
your
bitter
senses
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
has
a
slight
kick
but
it
goes
down
smooth
and
fast
i
cant
imagine
nursing
a
beer
like
this
for
too
long
its
so
good
you
dont
even
want
to
take
a
pause

can

my

pleasantly

a

challenging
by
midglass
but
overall
a
warming
brewand
at
75
a
case
probably
not
an
economic
choice
when
seeking
out
doppelbocks
which
i
falsely
thought
this
was
weighing
that
in
still
an
enjoyable
beer
to
sit
with

enjoy
one
prosit
not
a

if
you
like
old

anything
along

lines
you
will
probably
enjoy
this
one

great

not

i
could
have
multiple
of

sitting
deep

by
a

that
fades
quickly
to
a

aroma
has
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
and
alcoholic
notes
with
a
hint
of
noble
hops
flavor
is
also
very
sweet
and
malty
but
the
finish
is
balanced
more
towards
the
hops
with
a
slight
herbal
biterness
in
the
finish
after
a
few
sips
the
bitterness
creeps
in
but
its
definitely
balanced
by
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
very
solid
as
well
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
abv
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
wish
i
could
find
it
more
often
d
well
suited
alcohol
well
balanced
great
mouthfeel
very
well
done
pours
out
a
deep
amber
tinged
ruby
with
a
frothy
beige
head
that
stays

put

some
interesting

smells
incredible
the
mix
of
toasted
and
roasted
malts
dried
fruits
fresh
fruits
toffee
caramel
bread
nuts
honey
and
earthy
hops
is
just
about
perfect
kind
of
a
letdown
in
the
flavor
compared
to
the
nose
malt
is
not
as
chewy
and
rich
as
i
would
have
been
led
to
believe
has
a
nice
toastiness
and
dryness
though
an
odd
astringent
bitterness
starts
soon
after
the
sip
and
just
lingers
on
and
on
also
has
a
flat
yeastiness
to
it
not
my
cup
of
tea
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
considering
the
abv
but
there
remains
a
little
stickiness
and
some
lively
bubbles
drinkability
is
ok
its
not
a
drain
pour
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
buying
this
again
i
much
prefer
their
classic
over
this
one
maybe
im
just
not
big
on
doppelsticke
pours
a
light
muddy
brown
color
with
light
head
smell
is
thin
and
caramel

malt
mostly
taste
is
toasty
creamy
caramel
with
a
tart
edge
to
it
in
the
way
an
oktoberfest
might
be
somewhat
thin

smooth

drinkable

didnt
stand

enjoyable

this
is
a
unique
brew
probaly
the
first
for
me
with
this
taste
ive
had
altbiers
before
but
this
one
is
in
a
class
all
its
own
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
has
been
aging
in
my
cellar
for
over
two
years
and
while
it
is
a
little
rough
on
the
finish
from
the
oxidization
it
is
still
quite
a
nice
brew
flavors
disappeared
quickly
except
for
some
remaining
nuttiness
but
smooth
drinkability
made
me
want
another
sip
asap
beautifully
balanced
texture
this
is
possibly
the
easiest
drinking
double
bock
ive
had
d
a
rather
intense
brew
and
one
to
sip
the
8
5
comes
out
through
the
flavour
but
suitably
so
id
take
these
one
or
two
at
a
time
but
its
intriguing
enough
to
certainly
do
again
full
mouthfeel
moderate
and
even
carbonation
a
bit
powdery
and
tanic
very
drinkable
real
tasty
beer
note
i
really
need
some
westy
to
revive
my
hope
in
beer
really
fairly
thick
backbone
to
balance
the
high
abv
again
reminds
me
of
a
bw
brewed
by
a
german
this
may
be
the
first
time
ive
had
this
one
i
always
seem
to
pass
over
it
when
i
see
it
in
the
cooler
i
know
ive
had
at
least
12
other
uerige
beers
over
the
years
but
i
think
i
would
remember
this
fantastic
brew
a
big
flavorful
yet
balanced
doppelbock
a
pleasant
lager
from
a
brewery
i
probably
wouldve
passed
over
thankfully
i
didnt
11
2
oz
bottle
with
swing
top
0507
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
2
cm
offwhite
head
that
is
mostly
diminishing
aroma
is
full
of
dark
fruits
mostly
raisins
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
dark
fruits
maybe
more
dates
now
and
bitter
hops
and
some
citrus
medium
body
no
carbonation
very
light
lacing
some
alcohol
noted
as
it
warms
nice
beer
and
drinkable
quite
nice
brew
memorable
easy
to
drink
and
bold
i
would
buy
this
one
again
but
at
this
price
its
more
a
curiosity
and
not
a
stable
drinkability
not
too
hard
to
drink
surprisingly
given
its
strength
the
doppelsticke
tastes
just
like
the
sticke
but
stronger
and
warmer
going
down
with
about
the
same
drinkability
slightly
better
but
only
different
in
that
it
pours
alittle
redder
and
the
nose
is
stronger
i
like
this
better
than
the
sticke
it
has
a
stronger
taste
and
warms
the
soul
a
little
more
good
beer
i
am
sure
i
do
not
need
to
go
into
overall
drinkability
after
reading
the
above
comments
on
this
great
alt
i
think
it
was
a
great
easy
drink
i
would
love
to
pick
up
a
case
or
two
or
three
of
this
wonderful
nectar
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
it
though
i
would
try
it
again
but
perhaps
one
with
less
alcohol
the
alcohol
burn
and
taste
really
detracted
from
the
overall
experience
for
me
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
possibly
a
little
to
easy
for
a
beer
at
this
abv
level
not
too
filling
good
representation
of
style
nice
strong
kick
this
beer
is
certainly
unique
as
it
has
a
lot
more
sweetness
and
packs
a
little
bit
more
punch
than
most
altbiers
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
and
its
an
excellent
beer
overall
but
its
not
one
that
you
would
want
to
pound
down
for
a
whole
evening
a
really
unique
beer
very
drinkable
pours
a
dark
chestnut
with
a
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
some
lacing
the
smell
has
lots
of
dry
malt
up
front
some
fresh
grain
wasa
crackers
and
powderey
chocolate
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
lots
more
chocolate
very
big
dry
and
smooth
a
nicely
integrated
malt
bomb
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
and
quite
creamy
as
well
delicious
this
is
only
my
second
altbier
and
while
the
first
was
unremarkable
this
one
has
definitely
piqued
my
interest
in
the
style
keep
em
coming
fullthick
mouthfeelsyrupy
complex
tastes
more
drinkable
than
i
would
have
thought
from
first
impression
still
a
sipperon
the
filling
side
one
of
these
is
enough
for
me
d
a
good
dark
alt
tho
i
dont
recall
the
astringency
in
previous
samplings
well
have
to
compare
these
notes
next
time
d
one
was
good
overall
3
99
for
a
bottle
and
worth
it
i
highly
suggest
aging
this
my
bottle
was
bottled
on
05
07
and
it
was
sweet
and
fruity
4
months
in
give
it
time
to
ripen
pretty
light
though
there
is
a
lot
packed
into
the
body
carbonation
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
but
still
a
bit
higher
than
i
remember
from
aged
bottles
drinkability
is
pretty
high
though
this
falls
short
of
the
near
lethal
drinkability
of
previous
experiences
a
nice
beer
brown
in
color
has
that
distinctive
german
aroma
and
malt
flavor
that
is
unique
to
german
beers
stronger
than
the
sticke
alt
but
the
hop
level
was
adjusted
so
it
is
not
sweet
like
you
get
in
a
dopplebock
versus
a
bock
pretty
fresh
beer
and
it
had
just
arrived
in
the
state
and
was
new
on
the
shelf
at
papago
brewing
along
with
the
sticke
alt
i
didnt
like
this
at
first
but
it
eventually
grew
a
bit
on
me
was
it
to
style
likely
did
i
enjoy
it
only
marginally
uerige
doppelsticke
is
just
too
sweet
for
my
general
consumption
but
its
interesting
and
would
probably
be
a
lot
better
if
i
wasnt
drinking
it
on
a
sweaty
85
degree
night
in
south
carolina
try
it
and
form
your
own
opinion
at
the
least
youll
come
away
with
a
swell
swing
top
bottle
this
really
is
sort
of
like
a
german
barleywine
really
not
like
anything
ive
ever
had
on
a
side
note
i
find
it
interesting
they
brew
this
just
for
the
american
market
thanks
jdoolin
for
adding
this
one
to
the
trade
it
was
most
welcomed
bottle
courtesy
of
plucier
poured
a
dark
brown
color
beer
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
chocolate
and
dry
raisins
is
enjoyable
but
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
taste
is
comprised
of
sweet
malt
with
some
nice
notes
of
chocolates
and
dry
fruits
with
a
somewhat
dry
finish
well
done
overall
but
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
and
alt
but
again
it
is
style
that
i
dont
really
know
too
well
d
the
intensity
of
the
flavor
makes
this
one
a
sipper
and
i
think
that
11
2
oz
is
going
to
be
about
all
of
this
that
i
could
drink
in
one
sitting
still
this
one
is
damn
good
and
one
to
look
for
it
had
a
lovely
bitterness
to
it
with
some
big
coconut
in
the
finish
it
was
quite
dry
almost
sucking
any
moisture
that
was
in
your
mouth
to
begin
with
right
out
we
questioned
how
fresh
this
was
so
it
would
be
nice
to
taste
one
that
was
a
bit
fresher
the
drinkaility
is
good
this
would
be
a
killer
on
tap
prosit
mk
poured
with
good
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
seemed
to
boil
up
and
then
simmer
down
some
considerable
clarity
nice
auburn
and
purple
highlighting
with
the
darker
shades
over
top
the
beer
aroma
of
esters
and
roting
fruit
with
a
soft
malty
underscore
some
suggestion
of
alcohol
the
aftertaste
lingers
with
strong
malty
notes
the
flavour
note
as
strong
as
it
should
be
with
the
malts
faded
the
esters
weak
the
taste
showcased
alot
of
exotic
fruit
notes
like
coconut
but
oddly
left
your
mouth
feeling
quite
dry
this
was
alright
but
im
sure
alot
was
lost
with
age
id
love
to
be
able
to
try
this
fresh
we
didnt
intend
to
age
it
because
im
sure
its
much
better
than
what
my
first
impression
was
will
rereview
again
a
very
drinkable
brew
abv
putting
it
up
there
with
many
belgians
very
tasty
beer
and
one
that
goes
down
fairly
easy
considering
the
alcohol
content
my
only
experience
of
dusseldorf
was
passing
through
on
a
train
and
doing
a
doubletake
while
passing
the
whorehouse
near
the
train
station
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
pack
up
and
move
there
ooh
thats
tasty
its
the
nosferatu
of
germany
robust
but
plenty
hoppy
big
bitterness
for
a
german
beer
sweet
and
lightly
fruity
its
clean
as
an
alt
should
be
drinkability
definitely
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
havent
had
many
dopplesticks
yet
but
this
seems
to
be
styledefiniing
in
my
opinion
small
poptop
brown
bottle
from
florians
in
auburn
copperred
slightly
murky
translucent
body
with
about
a
half
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
leavea
fairly
good
lacing
nuttiness
dominates
the
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
black
licorice
or
root
beer
quality
to
it
nut
caramel
malt
roastiness
all
play
big
parts
in
the
flavor
with
hints
of
black
licorice
fruit
and
smoke
with
a
clean
finish
some
alcohol
warming
present
although
alcohol
flavor
is
almost
nonexistent
impressively
a
nice
and
surprising
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
body
but
id
still
approach
this
as
a
bit
of
a
sipper
actually
impressed
with
this
one
an
impressive
altbier
and
a
damn
good
lager
a
slight
bit
pricey
for
the
dollar
to
ounce
serving
but
well
worth
it
and
one
ill
be
visiting
again
warming
and
rich
is
how
this
beer
leaves
you
and
more
importantly
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
this
is
an
example
of
a
beer
that
typifies
what
beer
should
be
i
could
imagine
someone
hundreds
of
years
ago
ordering
a
beer
and
getting
something
like
this
its
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
very
full
caramel
flavor
with
a
hint
of
burning
alcohol
just
under
the
surface
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
is
substantial
if
this
is
representative
of
the
altbier
style
then
i
need
to
try
some
more
from
this
style
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
but
it
might
be
difficult
to
drink
more
than
two
of
these
cheers
11
2oz
bottle
this
bottle
gives
a
new
definition
to
the
term
long
neck
this
beer
certainly
has
the
longest
skinniest
neck
on
a
swing
top
that
i
have
ever
seen
it
opens
with
a
loud
pfffft
good
color
is
is
a
hazy
slightly
reddish
mahogany
hue
with
a
small
head
on
it
nice
aroma
notes
of
toffee
caramel
and
some
spiciness
an
interesting
taste
slightly
sweet
with
some
bitterness
at
the
same
time
the
taste
itself
is
quite
complex
full
flavor
with
notes
of
caramel
fruits
roastiness
and
others
coming
through
a
very
good
beer
uerige
doppelsticke
is
packaged
in
a
distinctive
33cl
swingtop
bottle
it
pours
a
deep
rubybrown
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
aroma
is
slightly
boozy
with
lots
of
sour
raisins
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
maybe
some
slight
citrus
flavors
as
well
taste
is
roasted
malt
more
raisins
with
a
semidry
finish
hops
are
evident
in
this
beer
but
there
is
a
ton
of
malt
as
well
amazingly
balanced
almost
a
coffee
like
aftertaste
medium
to
full
body
so
drinkable
i
wish
this
beer
were
more
available
my
previous
exposure
to
this
style
was
long
trail
double
bag
while
i
love
that
beer
still
this
one
blows
it
away
ill
have
to
try
the
uerige
altbier
next
d
a
tasty
bigger
more
complex
altbier
than
i
have
tried
in
the
past
lovely
concentrated
fruit
malt
aroma
has
some
mild
citrusy
tingle
in
the
nose
and
features
fruitcake
baked
pineapple
sweetbread
bannana
nut
bread
and
some
toned
down
caramel
accents
very
lovely
aroma
highligted
by
the
wonderfully
malt
complimentary
pineapple
notes
the
body
of
the
beer
is
a
ruddy
dusky
brown
and
holds
creamy
tan
head
that
is
about
the
thickness
of
a
standard
bic
pen
the
fore
is
a
rich
and
sweet
lowspice
fruitcake
baked
pineapple
accents
here
as
well
more
caramel
flavor
than
aroma
rich
sweet
and
malty
with
caramel
through
the
middle
the
finish
is
strongly
sweet
but
well
balanced
with
a
firm
bitterness
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
always
new
id
try
but
never
got
around
to
and
now
feel
silly
for
having
waited
so
long
very
nice
from
the
characteristic
long
necked
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brownmahogany
color
that
sports
intense
red
highlights
the
head
is
solid
and
tan
a
powerful
molasses
and
fruit
smell
leaps
from
the
glass
its
mixed
with
a
beautiful
malt
smell
wood
and
leather
theres
a
little
alcohol
aroma
and
some
mildly
roasted
qualities
this
is
certainly
the
smell
of
a
big
complex
beer
but
it
also
has
a
sense
of
wellcrafted
refinement
all
of
the
aromas
fit
together
perfectly
the
taste
is
similar
complex
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
malt
flavorsmolasses
again
a
little
toffee
caramel
ripe
fruit
and
a
modest
warming
despite
the
sweetness
theres
a
nice
balance
without
excessive
hops
the
finish
lingers
smooth
and
heavy
in
body
this
is
an
amazing
beer
the
smell
is
strong
with
tons
of
malt
caramel
some
nuts
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
good
it
starts
with
dark
toffee
and
malt
then
adds
caramel
and
some
dark
fruit
alcohol
and
some
degree
of
bitterness
take
over
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
finally
i
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
this
famous
altbier
this
bottle
cost
me
4
03
at
hitimes
in
costa
mesa
but
damn
it
was
worth
every
cent
quality
in
a
bottle
recommended
and
highly
impressive
lovely
stuff
surprising
balance
with
hoppy
bitterness
following
the
malt
throughout
the
sip
and
into
the
aftertaste
smoky
and
oily
in
the
mouth
but
both
enhance
the
flavor
instead
of
distorting
it
terrific
sticky
lacing
as
well
smooth
satisfying
mouthfeel
goes
a
way
to
hiding
the
hefty
abv
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
overall
but
you
cant
hide
from
quality
di
like
it
its
full
of
flavor
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
will
most
definitely
pick
up
more
of
these
mouth
malty
up
front
with
a
bit
of
a
chili
pepper
flavor
real
thick
and
yeasty
with
a
very
pleasant
long
lasting
bitter
finish
bitter
enough
that
it
tingles
up
to
my
ears
chewy
creamy
mouthfeel
hops
hit
really
hard
with
a
slight
grapefruit
flavor
as
it
warms
this
beer
gets
fruitier
and
more
enjoyable
some
banana
flavor
pops
through
and
some
chocolate
and
licorice
its
like
a
dark
hopped
up
hefeweizen
delicious
mouthfeel
is
off
slightly
and
hurts
the
drinkability
somewhat
this
is
an
enjoyably
complex
tasty
sipping
beer
always
comes
in
that
oddball
yet
so
awesome
looking
bottle
the
color
is
a
amber
maple
syrup
with
some
trubby
haze
pretty
crappt
foam
and
head
the
aroma
is
stale
bread
with
some
alcohol
the
tomgue
is
hit
with
more
stale
bread
biscuits
and
hints
of
bananas
ohh
yeah
and
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
but
more
than
wanted
for
an
alt
but
uerige
is
the
only
brewery
ive
tried
any
altbier
from
so
im
still
open
to
try
more
beers
of
this
style
excellent
for
sipping
i
plan
to
store
the
second
bottle
that
i
bought
for
a
while
to
see
how
it
changes
mostly
clear
chestnut
with
a
modest
yet
solid
head
of
fine
tan
bubbles
lacing
is
shortlived
and
coats
the
glass
caramel
dominates
the
aroma
but
there
are
fruit
and
yeast
notes
that
really
round
it
out
smells
delicious
mild
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
hop
flavour
to
provide
a
bit
of
balance
to
the
malt
sweet
to
start
caramel
and
fruit
apple
and
raisin
follow
quickly
along
with
breadiness
then
bitterness
and
alcohol
warmth
carry
into
the
finish
refined
texture
with
a
full
body
and
well
integrated
fine
carbonation
though
the
low
carbonation
levels
leave
it
feeling
just
a
bit
dull
this
left
a
really
good
impression
its
reminiscent
of
some
old
ales
particularly
those
of
higher
abv
id
definitely
have
this
again
all
in
all
a
great
beer
drinks
like
a
alt
tastes
more
like
a
dopplebock
well
rounded
well
made
and
much
enjoyed
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tried
i
will
buy
more
of
these
just
to
keep
them
for
special
occasions
if
you
want
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
one
to
look
for
bottled
on
0604
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
creamy
off
white
head
aroma
is
fruity
with
raisens
and
caramel
that
is
also
a
bit
doughey
taste
is
thick
creamy
and
complex
that
is
very
yeasty
and
bready
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
overall
this
is
a
brew
that
is
definately
worth
trying
recommended
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
it
will
take
me
a
bit
to
get
used
to
such
a
bold
version
of
the
duesseldorfer
altbier
i
really
enjoy
it
but
it
is
really
in
a
different
class
from
its
traditional
cousins
this
beer
is
better
aged
to
enhance
the
drinkability
but
there
is
so
much
alcohol
here
it
makes
the
whole
experience
a
lot
different
this
is
not
necessarily
a
beer
for
someone
who
likes
alts
like
myself
but
more
for
someone
that
would
like
a
german
barley
wineif
there
was
such
a
thing
the
hops
are
such
a
big
player
that
it
really
doesnt
fit
in
any
other
category
it
is
good
and
i
would
definitely
drink
it
againbut
it
is
big
for
the
style
that
i
am
used
to
drinkablity
a
fine
sipper
i
have
heard
uerige
beers
are
best
fresh
and
i
believe
it
fantastic
beer
just
absolutely
awesome
mouthfeel
is
smooth
quite
smooth
mediumbodied
and
smooth
overall
a
nicely
flavored
brew
the
smell
is
a
bit
misleading
but
i
like
that
the
taste
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
nose
would
have
you
believe
its
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
fruity
coffee
but
not
really
fruity
just
smooth
good
solid
tasty
german
craft
some
might
have
a
hard
time
having
more
than
one
bottle
but
would
probably
seek
to
get
it
again
at
some
point
as
for
myself
i
could
easily
see
sitting
down
with
a
few
of
these
notes
one
that
ill
seek
out
in
bulk
this
is
the
fourth
of
four
and
im
depressed
that
its
gone
for
now
dark
brown
hue
with
a
tint
of
red

nice
tan
head
small
bubbles

nose
caramel
red
fruit
cherries
and
raspberries
and
subtle
oats

caramel
cereal
cane
sugar
yeast
and
honey
taste

raw
grainy
palate
aftertaste
brown
sugar
cereal
honey
and
salty
pours
the
color
of
dark
rust
with
dirt
and
ruby
highlights
appetizingly
enough
some
carbonation
and
a
relatively
small
but
persistent
head
aromas
are
of
very
sweet
molasses
spices
and
sugared
figs
very
doppelbock
like
no
hops
are
apparent
on
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
first
sensation
is
one
of
sweetness
followed
by
pinpricks
of
carbonation
the
sweetness
fades
then
to
metals
then
into
a
long
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
the
weight
of
this
beer
seems
to
thin
out
toward
the
finish
overall
a
wonderful
beer
very
smooth
with
completely
hidden
alcohol
weighty
enough
to
be
substantial
smooth
enough
to
be
enjoyed
often
medium
body
with
little
carbonation
not
very
easy
drinking
the
only
other
version
of
this
brew
ive
tasted
has
been
victory
10
anniversary
so
here
it
goes
appears
a
slight
clouded
amber
dark
copper
with
a
light
cream
colored
head
leaves
fine
even
lacing
down
my
glass
aroma
contains
complex
tart
raisincitrus
anise
fruity
alcohol
presence
as
well
taste
alcohol
is
evident
a
little
hot
indeed
nice
spicy
herbal
content
toasted
nut
caramel
complex
fruity
notes
alcoholic
plum
raisin
mix
very
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slight
syrupy
texture
higher
carbonation
does
tickle
the
throat
light
burn
on
the
palate
drinkability
one
to
savor
quite
a
rare
offering
that
i
have
only
seen
on
a
few
occasions
quality
but
not
something
i
would
crave
over
and
over
again
prost
beertracker
d
very
dry
and
quite
enjoyable
ipa
vs
doppelbock
not
bad
not
great
not
much
to
this
one
imo
tawny
in
color
with
a
fantastic
headwouldbe
lace
along
the
side
of
my
glass
the
carbonation
was
light
and
undisturbing
aromas
of
roasted
nuts
slightly
sweet
goodness
and
with
a
backdrop
of
almost
hollistic
german
hops
smooth
on
the
palate
almost
coating
the
hops
are
in
no
way
overpowering
as
it
is
the
malt
that
speaks
the
volumes
here
again
the
fruit
notes
come
through
on
the
tongue
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
one
may
be
borderline
on
knife
and
fork
in
its
chewiness
and
that
is
ok
by
me
a
nice
balance
of
the
malt
underlying
sweetness
and
the
hops
a
fine
fine
brew
to
be
sure
drinkability
very
nice
brew
not
my
favorite
style
but
if
you
like
altbiers
this
is
a
great
one
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
enjoyable
german
beers
ive
had
yet
reminds
more
of
a
french
or
belgian
concoction
than
a
german
but
i
never
doubted
the
countrys
ability
to
make
great
beer
maybe
i
doubted
their
ability
to
make
different
beer
considering
their
incredibly
strict
brewing
laws
i
stand
reminded
of
this
countrys
awesome
brewing
capabilities
the
body
is
mid
to
full
body
limited
carbonation
overall
this
should
have
more
of
a
drier
flavor
but
still
easy
to
drink
sticke
it
to
you
drinkability
superb
and
easy
drinking
this
was
a
wonderful
find
and
is
better
than
the
sticke
version
buy
this
if
you
find
it
drinkbility
is
great
very
enjoyable
wishing
i
had
another
already
little
pricey
but
worth
it
a
very
nice
surprise
i
was
hoping
for
an
equal
exchange
of
goodness
for
the
5
29
per
11
2
oz
bottle
price
tag
and
got
it
a
special
beer
for
a
special
price
and
worth
getting
this
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
good
sized
dirty
white
head
the
smell
has
a
real
bisquity
aroma
the
yeast
smell
was
overwhelming
like
walking
into
a
bakery
but
this
also
has
sweet
malt
and
maple
syrup
scents
the
taste
starts
with
a
creamy
feel
to
it
the
flavors
include
smoked
woodsweet
malt
maple
toffee
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
mf
is
medium
and
chewy
with
the
flavors
mixing
extremely
well
this
is
an
absolute
classic
you
must
try
this
beer
as
an
additional
note
i
love
the
bottles
took
it
home
to
add
to
my
homebrew
swingtop
collection
pours
a
muddy
brown
with
a
light
nutty
brown
head
sweet
caramel
dominates
the
aroma
but
there
is
also
some
chocolate
and
maybe
a
slight
port
quality
the
caramel
is
also
the
first
thing
noticable
in
the
taste
but
there
is
also
a
nice
nuttiness
to
it
slight
hints
of
smoky
peat
the
alcohol
becomes
more
noticable
as
it
warms
sticky
mouthfeel
probably
too
heavy
to
drink
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
but
something
nice
to
relax
with
at
the
end
of
the
day
drinkability
again
the
maltiness
is
a
bit
much
providing
too
strong
of
a
sweetness
at
times
a
poster
child
for
the
bigger
is
not
better
movement
uerige
doppelsticke
doesnt
look
quite
as
spectacular
as
the
other
uerige
beers
because
its
darker
color
is
more
dull
than
their
jewellike
majesty
in
all
other
ways
however
it
meets
or
surpasses
their
excellence
has
there
ever
been
a
more
complex
more
deliciously
drinkable
trio
of
similarly
styled
beers
from
any
one
brewery
not
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
yummy
droplet
indeed
drinkability
is
above
average
but
overall
this
one
was
a
large
disappointment
to
me
maybe
the
beer
simply
does
not
travel
well
d
very
easy
drinking
despite
its
8
5
abv
cant
believe
it
dangerously
drinkable
sessionablity
is
a
personal
thing
but
a
wee
too
heavy
for
me
a
clean
deep
copper
colored
beer
has
a
nice
foamy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
nicely
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
candy
some
dried
fruit
and
in
the
background
alcohol
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
licorice
the
caramel
sweetness
hits
first
in
the
taste
followed
by
a
quick
rush
of
alcohol
then
some
dried
fruit
and
a
bit
of
coffee
bitterness
with
a
dry
finish
drinkable
but
too
heavy
to
have
more
than
2
a
session
nice
beer
for
a
cold
night
wish
i
couldve
had
some
of
this
over
in
deustchland
where
im
sure
it
surely
cheaper
most
likely
better
definitely
worth
a
purchase
a
great
after
dinner
glass
d
not
great
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
sometime
but
it
isnt
too
easy
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
more
than
anything
gives
problems
it
is
unsessionable
as
for
food
it
is
strong
alcohol
ad
sweet
if
a
jack
and
coke
would
work
so
would
this
definetly
another
beer
i
would
find
fresh
to
appreciate
more
of
what
it
has
to
offer
but
this
isn
t
bad
at
all
rusy
cola
brown
with
an
offwhite
bonelike
head
that
fizzles
out
quickly
smells
of
many
malts
toffee
caramel
sweet
fruits
nuts
berries
sugar
coated
cinnamon
dusted
twigs
and
more
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
up
front
spicy
and
fruity
in
the
middle
and
boozy
and
drying
in
the
finish
to
sum
it
up
nicely
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
sweet
drinkability
is
good
but
the
sweetness
really
cuts
into
me
these
days
still
a
beautiful
example
of
the
style
an
awesome
double
alt
dangerously
drinkable
for
this
level
of
abv
additionally
the
taste
is
subtle
enough
to
be
an
easy
drinker
i
went
through
the
bottle
much
quicker
than
i
normally
do
i
could
get
myself
into
alot
of
trouble
with
this
one
very
well
done
beer
is
good
happy
desseldorf
beering
put
me
on
a
plane
to
germany
now
quite
excellent
really
theres
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
its
dry
sweet
and
clean
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
treat
but
at
40
cents
an
ounce
its
has
limited
drinkability
great
now
and
then
but
8
5
makes
it
a
one
and
done
brew
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
from
a
33cl
brown
swingtop
bottle
mild
hop
aroma
not
much
else
the
malt
character
is
fairly
strong
the
hops
are
present
too
has
a
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
with
some
definite
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
i
dont
think
ive
had
an
alt
before
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
especially
considering
its
alcohol
content
definitely
worth
a
try
but
it
is
on
the
pricey
side
finally
tracked
down
at
premiere
gourmet
recent
shipment
not
as
enjoyable
as
the
others
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
the
alcohol
was
burning
me
a
bit
in
the
nose
in
the
taste
smooth
mouthfeel
nice
appearance
in
the
glass
but
sourish
which
some
like
yes
there
is
chocolate
malt
which
gave
bitterness
pours
a
threefingered
pillowy
cream
head
that
goes
slowly
and
leaves
a
good
lace
nearly
clear
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
light
hops
starts
with
the
hops
and
malts
nearly
balanced
some
sweetness
finish
has
some
hops
good

for
the
american

as
per
the
uerige
website
served
lightly
chilled
it
pours
an
unfiltered
chestnutbrown
with
a
halfinch
of
khaki
head
that
leaves
nice
trails
of
lacing
throughout
smells
of
caramel
and
vinous
malts
green
hopshop
oils
sweetness
and
maybe
some
metal
kinda
like
a
dopplebock
it
has
a
big
maltiness
up
front
and
a
big
hop
background
with
a
thick
body
that
drinks
like
a
meal
other
flavors
are
burnt
malts
raisins
hop
oils
leafy
hops
alcohol
and
a
good
allaround
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
burnt
malts
overall
very
nice
a
beer
that
i
would
come
back
to
reminds
me
of
a
dopplebock
with
ale
yeast
now
to
try
others
in
the
uerige
lineup
overall
i
still
prefer
the
4
5
alt
but
this
one
is
excellent
as
well
i
guess
this
could
be
a
different
style
less
of
a
session
due
to
alcohol
level
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
light
tan
head
over
a
somewhat
murky
dark
amberlight
brown
brew
head
fades
rather
quickly
with
spotty
delicate
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
grains
and
fruit
taste
is
slight
vinous
with
dark
fruits
yet
malt
still
evident
throughout
and
a
light
alcoholic
close
and
warming
flows
tremendously
easy
over
the
tongue
and
drinkability
is
also
excellent
especially
for
something
with
a
higher
abv
wont
be
sorry
here
lovely
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
redish
hue
nice
head
and
lots
of
lace
smell
is
sweet
malty
and
very
inviting
moutfeel
is
medium
with
a
hint
of
carbanation
taste
is
sweet
and
rich
you
can
really
taste
the
alchol
in
the
finish
this
is
a
excellent
beer
tastes
malty
very
slight
oxidation
may
have
contributed
some
sherry
notes
but
these
flavors
dont
seem
to
be
off
in
any
way
big
mouthfeel
i
will
deduct
from
drinkability
because
of
oxidation
even
if
it
is
slight
drinkability
another
winner
for
tonight
very
tasty
and
worth
picking
up
for
a
try
pours
with
a
frothy
fine
bubbled
tan
to
pale
brown
colored
head
the
beer
is
brilliantly
clear
yet
quite
dark
and
amber
hued
wow
the
aroma
is
concentrated
and
malty
with
notes
of
molasses
and
dark
sweet
cakelike
notes
there
is
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
and
even
something
resembling
cinnamon
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
malty
up
front
yet
it
has
a
spicy
hoppiness
to
it
as
well
the
finish
is
dry
in
a
sort
of
cocoa
powder
way
but
some
of
the
malty
toffeelike
sweetness
lingers
on
the
palate
and
tongue
even
after
swallowing
this
beer
this
beer
is
quite
rich
and
concentrated
definitely
of
bock
strength
this
almost
reminds
me
of
rich
dark
german
cake
or
sweetbread
that
has
been
lightly
spiced
this
beer
has
that
characteristic
fresh
alt
hoppiness
that
no
bock
would
have
herbal
with
even
a
hint
of
citrus
fruit
this
is
quite
nice
and
flavorful
d
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
stuff
very
rich
despite
that
it
is
still
a
very
nice
beer
worth
having
from
time
to
time
quite
enjoyable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
am
sure
i
will
purchase
this
one
again
also
i
would
like
to
try
the
other
ones
they
brew
damned
good
stuff
drink
it
when
you
see
it
somewhat
hazy
reddish
color
quickly
receeding
head
low
aromasweet
maltsomewhat
toffeeish
malt
flavor
dominates
great
caramel
sweetness
backed
by
a
nuttiness
that
cant
be
beat
very
soft
and
velvety
tastingcould
that
be
the
water
no
hop
bitterness
to
be
found
here
great
mouthfeel
overall
a
killer
beer
i
could
see
drinking
this
all
night
even
at
8
5
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
just
great
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
smell
its
very
difficult
to
distinguish
this
from
a
doppelbock
there
are
hardly
any
alelike
characteristics
at
all
actually
as
i
dont
detect
any
fruit
and
the
finish
is
very
clean
and
lagerlike
a
nice
nuttiness
lingers
on
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
crisp
but
loses
carbonation
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
and
becomes
too
watery
which
hinders
the
drinkability
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
presented
in
a
nicelooking
skinny
longnecked
bottle
with
a
swingtop
poured
into
my
stange
the
body
is
a
dark
caramel
color
topped
by
a
good
three
inches
of
creamy
sticky
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
pretty
lacing
aroma
is
heavy
on
tangy
yeast
with
spicy
hops
sweet
caramel
malt
raisin
and
dark
sugar
accented
by
a
significant
alcohol
presence
palate
is
dominated
by
roasted
caramel
malt
accompanied
by
notes
of
raisins
nuts
brown
sugar
and
the
slightest
tinge
of
hops
finish
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
warming
alcohol
body
is
full
and
just
a
bit
sticky
just
about
perfect
for
a
robust
altbier
man
this
is
pretty
damn
good
outstanding
pours
a
mediumbrown
color
that
is
about
slightly
opaque
the
head
is
white
colored
that
leaves
behind
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
figs
dates
and
malt
seem
to
come
out
the
taste
is
very
much
malt
and
sugar
dominated
with
a
fruity
presence
that
intensifies
as
the
beer
warms
the
figs
and
dates
seem
to
blend
together
very
well
it
took
me
some
time
to
identify
these
flavors
because
the
malt
is
so
dominant
both
in
the
taste
and
the
aftertaste
a
few
sips
leads
to
a
warming
alcohol
sensation
an
interesting
beer
since
i
havent
had
this
style
before
so
smooth
for
being
so
big
and
complex
classic
german
flavors
to
the
extreme
something
unseen
to
these
beer
eyes
this
beer
pours
a
chenut
brown
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
with
a
tight
one
finger
headawesome
aromas
going
one
very
nutty
with
huge
molasses
and
vanilla
tones
this
brew
exudes
complexities
even
more
as
it
warmsvery
doughy
with
molasses
and
with
an
underlying
nuttiness
finishing
with
a
nice
herbalspiciness
that
rounds
it
out
nicely
a
big
complex
gem
here
with
alot
going
on
flavor
wiseglad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
alcohol
is
masterly
hidden
and
this
beer
is
dangerous
because
it
is
way
to
smooth
to
drink
for
such
a
high
abv
drinkability
to
me
the
alcohol
presence
seems
a
little
out
of
context
in
this
style
of
beer
its
an
interesting
concept
a
dopplealt
and
applaudable
but
ill
take
their
regular
old
sticke
any
day
of
the
week
over
this
so
glad
this
is
now
in
my
market

no
sign

great

i
thought
the
sticke
alt
was
good
but
the
dopplesticke
blows
it
away
too
bad
its
so
expensive
this
stuff
is
for
real
buy
two
bottles
if
you
find
it
i
made
the
mistake
of
only
taking
home
one
purchased
cellars
wine
spirits
in
minnetonka
mn
body
is
almost
big
yet
slick
and
almost
juicey
feeling
soft
carbonation
adds
to
the
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
the
8
5
is
well
integrated
into
the
brew
awesome
bottle
too
definately
worth
3
50
a
pop
awesome
drinkability
because
i
want
to
sip
this
beer
so
slow
so
i
can
savor
every
ounce
this
is
a
beer
to
pair
with
gourmet
cheese
i
found
the
palate
to
be
simply
complex
at
no
point
am
i
awed
or
overwhelmed
but
i
am
delighted
every
second
excellent
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
fort
collins
co
i
believe
i
want
more
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
could
suck
these
down
all
night
long
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
cheers
even
better
than
the
normal
secret
this
is
the
double
dog
dare
it
is
darker
prettier
and
with
a
more
healthy
head
the
aromas
are
darker
with
molasses
and
dark
sugar
riding
around
with
the
usual
belgian
the
same
yeasty
swirls
are
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
darker
with
a
heavier
mouthfeel
candy
sugar
and
dark
malts
run
the
show
here
a
great
sipping
brew
yet
again
this
would
be
deadly
as
a
tap
version
here
in
the
states
but
please
bring
it
anyway

to

there
are

no

and
liked

then
i
have
one

and
will
rereview
in

right
about
now
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
wont

some
fruit
flavors
like
plum
cherry
and
raisin
coming
through
briefly
before
a
fairly
big
assault
of
grassy
hops
hitleaving
a
slightly
lingering
bitterness
which
mixes
with
the
alcohol
taste
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
somewhat
creamy
and
dispite
the
big
sweetness
isnt
at
all
syrupy
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
beerkind
of
the
barley
wine
of
alts
but
in
the
end
its
a
little
much
for
me
and
id
prefer
one
of
ueriges
other
versions
i
hope
they
keep
brewing
this
stuff
it
is
awesome

to

the

a
good

of
toasty

are
there
as
is

there
are

they
are
definitely
not
the

very

like
in

flavor
a
good

this
out
pretty
thick

with
flavor
damn
drinkable

well
a

have
been

of
a
sip
to
the
end
starts
a
tad
sweet
with
nutty
hazlenut
flavors
and
spices
that
get
you
thinking
of
warming
holiday
brews
a
mild
yet
crisp
hop
bitterness
leads
you
towards
the
end
where
youll
find
yourself
hit
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
massive
wallop
of
malty
goodness
cripes
i
didnt
expect
this
to
be
this
good
and
the
mouthfeel
so
smooth
and
velvety
perfection
on
that
slightly
warming
from
the
alcohol
but
its
hidden
well
definitely
somewhat
of
a
cross
between
a
big
malty
german
alt
and
an
american
barleywine
ima
go
buy
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
goodness
thankya
very
much
d
this
is
a
good
solid
altbier
it
has
the
great
malty
flavors
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
with
the
alcohol
warmth
to
balance
very
nice
brew
overall
really
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
at
new
beer
distributors
in
nyc
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
it
is
slightly
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
masquerading
as
an
alt
but
with
a
much
lighter
less
severe
flavor
and
texture
moreover
the
typical
alt
characteristics
hold
it
together
quite
nicely
try
this
one
if
you
can
ill
treat
this
as
a
dubbelbockalt
it
has
the
sweet
brown
pecan
pie
spice
aromas
reminiscent
of
celebrator
ot
traquair
house
ale
creamy
textured
and
loaded
with
sweet
malt
flavor
the
alcohol
pulls
away
from
the
roasted
bitterness
leaving
a
coughsyrup
effect
that
could
become
a
chore
to
drink
sticky
tarry
bitterness
on
the
finish
huge
creamy
light
brown
colored
head
faded
slowly
leaving
scattered
strings
of
lace
dark
copper
almost
mahogany
colored
beer
has
a
transparent
candy
hue
to
it
sweet
caramel
malt
candied
flowers
and
a
whif
of
pineapple
in
the
aroma
strong
sweet
malt
up
front
feels
fairly
thick
plums
and
vinuous
notes
in
the
middle
mix
with
caramel
and
alcohol
a
mild
bitterness
joins
the
party
at
the
end
supressing
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
full
but
not
to
the
point
of
thick
my
first
imperial
altbier
but
flavorful
and
light
on
the
finish
there
is
a
healthy
toasted
nut
flavor
unless
they
can
find
the

5this
one
apparently
had
been
flying
off
the
shelves
and
what
a
sight
and
treat
it
was
had
several
glasses
personally
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
some
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
bready
this
is
quite
the
drinkable
beer
one
of
my
favorite
german
beers
sit
down
at
the
brewery
and
this
is
what
you
get
like
it
or
not
fortunately
i
did
and
had
another
beginning
is
very
soft
on
the
palate
with
lots
of
earth
and
wholegrain
bread
while
a
subtle
biscuit
touch
adds
sweeter
hints
to
it
malt
body
then
turns
particular
bitter
for
an
alt
still
accompanying
the
malts
finishes
with
slightly
sour
soft
yeasty
hints
while
a
dry
bitter
hop
note
becomes
more
present
inconvenient
bitter
very
complex
with
a
distinct
flowery
dry
hop
note
amongst
a
bready
malt
body
a
terrifically
malty
tasty
beer
i
wish
it
came
in
a
bigger
bottle
this
one
of
the
best
german
breweries
that
you
can
get
in
the
us
awesome
stuff
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
but
because
of
the
bitterness
and
hops
i
suspect
that
my
10
month
old
bottle
had
some
oxidation
so
try
to
get
this
beer
fresher
than
that
a
great
intensity
of
aromas
beautiful
balance
between
malts
yeasts
and
hops
creating
a
strong
very
german
bitterness
that
few
beers
achieve
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
tiny
chunks
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
biscuit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
surprising
hoppy
flavor
that
i
wasnt
expecting
based
on
the
smell
o
do
not
quite
get
why
this
is
supposedly
better
than
other
altbier
in
my
opinion
this
is
middle
of
the
road
o
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
and
balanced
altbier
probably
the
best
ive
ever
had
overall
impression
a
darker
heavier
and
more
ale
like
version
of
the
altbier
while
this
beer
exhibits
lager
like
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
it
leans
towards
an
ale
in
clarity
flavor
and
aroma
o
good
overall
altbier
not
my
favorite
style
but
worthy
of
a
try

with
a
smooth

and
a
slight

at
the

overall
a
very
different
animal
than
what
is
generally
available
in
the

a
great

not
many

is
left
down

consumption
the
aroma
is

and
malty
caramel
with
some
brown
bread
with
some
woody
and
grassy
notes
from
the
hops
the
rich
yet
delicate
maltiness
of
this
beer
is
up
front
with
the
hops
providing
some
of
that
woody
and
grassy
flavor
from
the
hops
the
malt
character
of
this
beer
is
bready
with
some
mild
caramel
sweetness
like
a
previous
reviewer
i
would
agree
there
is
more
hop
bitterness
than
you
would
expect
from
the
aroma
but
it
is
wellbalanced
with
the
malt
backbone

a

o
a
great
alt
that
is
balanced
delicate
and
smooth
the
nose
is
much
sweeter
than
the
taste
but
its
cuts
the
sweet
perfectly
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
was
unique
and
almost
tricky
with
the
switch
in
taste
to
more
roasted
and
smoked
flavor
i
expected
it
to
be
similar
to
a
sweet
belgian
dark
ale
i
recommend
trying
this
one
out
cheers
o
what
a
fascinating
style
this
was
straightforward
that
would
be
great
on
a
fall
evening
lots
of
bread
with
caramel
and
peppery
hops
to
balance
it
out
if
your
interested
in
this
style
you
should
pick
this
one
up
overall
its
actually
fairly
nice
but
i
think
i
prefer
some
of
the
other
uerige
versions
compared
to
this
beer
still
medium
bodied
with
mediumlevel
carbonation
that
creates
at
first
a
crisp
mouthfeel
that
gradually
soothes
into
being
quite
a
bit
smoother
finish
is
dry
o
quite
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
enjoyable
flavor
and
low
abv
o
a
very
easy
drinking

a
great
example
of
the
style
well
worth
checking
this
one
out
d
very
drinkable
loaded
with
malt
flavor
very
easy
to
have
more
than
one
in
an

recommended
poured
an
orange
brown

to
avoid
the

on

offwhite

that
leaves
a
bit

nose
is

than
most
alts
ive
come
across
predominantly
plum
but
some
general
dark
fruits
otherwise
some
notes
almost
resembling

having
a
greater

ive
had
before
certainly
could
been

a

up

one
of
the
best
beers
i
have

beer
love
pour
is
a
caramelcolored
liquid
that
is
mostly
clear
thin
offwhite
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing

brings
a
good
amount
of
light

and
earthy

nothing
too
complex
perhaps
a
bit
of
very
light
fruit
flavor
is
similarly
restrained
with
some
bread
and
then
not
too
much
else
however
the
hops
coke
through
in
the
finish
for
a
good
bitterness
light
body
and
good
carbonation
good
but
nowhere
near
the
sticke
or
especially
the
doppelsticke
overall
perhaps
a
bad
or
old
bottle
but
i
have
had
this
before
and
remember
the
same
qualities
i
know
it
is
the
classic
altbier
but
it
does
not
agree
with
me
at
all
overall
a
nice
beer
probably
tastes
better
fresh
and
i
realize
finding
that
will
be
an
uphill
battle
but
i
will
try
very
drinkable
and
unoffensive
this
beer
is
meant
for
large
consumption
and
done
so
quickly
a
great
thirst
quencher
for
food
pairings
but
lacking
complexity
for
deep
evaluation
light
graininess
and
slight
overattenuation
gives
a
mild
watery
effect
late
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easy
this
would
be
a
nice
fall
beer
o
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
very
tasty
and
worth
the
price
its
hard
to
do
this
beer
a
justice
as
adjectives
worthy
enough
to
describe
it
simply
dont
exist
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
possible
the
best
altbier
in
the
world
definitely
uerige
alt
classic
pours
an
auburn
color
with
a
thin
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
caramel
chocolate
and
toast
that
leads
to
a
flavor
with
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
anise
notes
very
well
balanced
its
got
a
mediumfull
mouthfeel
that
is
very
filling
this
is
a
good
altbier
recommended
d
i
could
drink
them
all
day
long
based
on
flavor
and
abv
great
drinkability
d
quite
nice
and
much
more
malty
than
i
expected
it
to
be
there
is
a
lot
of
toast
and
caramel
with
some
surprising
fruity
notes
the
hops
are
present
and
while
they
are
not
particularly
intense
they
balance
the
malt
while
also
adding
a
light
spicy
touch
to
the
beer
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
quite
sessionable

the
flavor

brown

long

finish
decent
brew
but
personally
i
would
prefer
local
hoppy
ambers
maybe
ill
try
a
fresher
bottle
next
time
what
is
the
deal
with
some
of
these
alts
being
disproportionately
bitter
and
i
am
a
guy
who
loves
ipas
i
tend
to
enjoy
the
more
balanced
examples
of
the
style
such
as
schlüssel
and
schumacher
the
flavor
is
caramel
and
roasted
malts
upfront
with
a
nice
bitter
edge
at
the
end
and
a
clean
aftertaste
no
problems
whatsoever
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
within
this
style
drinkability
a
solid
beer
but
as
i
said
its
not
precisely
my
cup
of
tea
totally
drinkable
though
dgood
beer
that
i
would
have
again
but
i
personally
think
that
there
are
better
balanced
altbiers
in
dusseldorf
d
same
theme
here
very
good
for
the
style
overall
but
not
outstanding
for
a
beer
in
general
drinkable
incredibly
flavorful
for
the
low
abv
it
washes
the
tongue
with
bitter
herbal
hops
flavors
of
earth
and
mineral
toasted
malt
and
light
fruity
tartness
its
a
complex
beer
difficult
to
wrap
the
mind
around
but
immensely
enjoyable
the
finish
has
a
big
hoppy
bite
quite
bitter
but
also
faintly
metallic
and
sour
this
is
a
beer
ill
have
to
revisit
a
few
times
before
i
can
fully
grasp
every
nuance
drinkability
this
is
said
to
be
one
of
the
most
sought
after
altbiers
and
is
deserving
so
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
2
from
the
brewery
d
this
is
a
fairly
light
easy
drinking
beer
but
the
bitterness
from
the
roasted
grain
and
the
hops
may
be
a
turnoff
to
some
i
like
it
another
great
beer
from
uerige
its
a
little
bit
thinner
than
their
sticke
but
thats
to
be
expected
little
to
no
head
on
the
beer
but
good
lacing
great
amber
color
with
great
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
is
a
great
session
beer
where
you
can
have
many
without
getting
full
drinkability
hahahahahaha
o

the
floral
character
is
nice
beer
has
a

cleanly
with
no

there
is
a
mild
bitterness
throughout
but
there
is
not
much
flavor
up
front
at
all
the
more
i
drink
the
more
there
appears
an
aftertaste
a
slight
bitter
taste
that
builds
in
my
mouth
maybe
a
like
sulfur
in
that
back
flavor
as
well
drinkability
good
and
mouthfeel
could
use
some
more
connectivity
but
overall
a
good
experience
slightly
watered

sweet
dark
fruit
notes
licorice
saaz
hops
and
a

finish

this
beer
is
a
touch
lighter
than
the
regular
sticke
dense
offwhite
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
on
the
nose
this
is
clean
with
grassy
hops
and
a
bready
character
that
makes
me
think
of
raisin
bread
mildly
spicy
almost
ryelike
with
a
touch
of
baking
spices
the
palate
opens
up
very
hoppy
and
bitter
with
earthy
hops
with
the
character
of
petrichor
mildly
grassy
and
lemony
the
malt
character
is
similar
to
but
a
touch
lighter
than
the
sticke
mild
caramel
is
present
and
the
finish
is
long
dry
and
bitter
carbonation
is
high
and
enjoyable
drier
and
hoppier
than
the
sticke
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
prefer
the
sticke
though
d
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
flavor
and
mouthfeel
combine
to
create
a
fantastically
smooth
beer
really
love
this
one
theres
just
something
very
sessionable
about
this
beer
i
think
its
that
up
front
sweetness
and
dry
finish
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
not
sure
but
i
like
it
mfd
they
nailed
the
feel
on
this
one
it
is
a
solid
medium
body
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
bingo
right
on
the
mark
the
drinkabilty
is
also
very
exceptional
but
maybe
this
is
because
i
dont
particularly
enjoy
this
style
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
have
another
other
than
that
fact
no
aspect
of
the
beer
hampers
the
drinkability
which
is
the
main
important
thing
here

receeds
smell
is
slightly
sweet
slightly
nuttyyeast
with
some
minor
fruity
hops
in
there
as
well
mediumbodied
and
slightly
chewey
this
is
a
dry
beer
but
still
rich
and
smooth
and
easy
down
the
hatch
has
a
biscuitbreadnutty
taste
along
with
some
slightly
sticky
and
sweet
malts
hop
bitterness
leads
to
a
dry
backbite
that
balances
the
beer
with
some
fruit
flavors
a
great
beer
to
just
chill
out
with
a
perfect
quaffer
if
ever
there
was
one
with
such
a
wonderful
complexity
not
found
in
lagers
but
with
that
clean
crisp
lager
character
thanks
to
the
lagering
period
involved
a
topnotch
altbier
and
one
of
the
exemplars
of
the
style
i
cant
wait
to
someday
try
this
vom
fass
at
the
source
in
the
düsseldorfer
altstadt
delicious
drinkable
and
delectable
i
want
another
a
very
drinkable
and
elaborate
alt
dark
amber
with
a
mild
head
clean
with
consistent
bubbles
coming
up
nose
is
malty
brown
sugar
with
a
smoky
quality
palate
is
that
with
a
bold
bitter
leather
quality
that
is
a
bit
sour
smoky
this
could
be
a
big
turn
off
seeing
as
this
one
doesnt
seem
as
malty
as
others
not
particularly
sweet
going
down
but
earthy
bitter
with
a
oily
resin
quality
in
the
malt
i
dont
know
if
the
crisp
quality
does
the
style
justice
the
sweetness
seemed
to
hide
the
bitter
smoke
before
this
is
well
just
as
drinkable
but
in
a
different
manner
very
flavorful
but
very
light
weight
dry
and
oily
too
walnut
apple
and
a
pilsner
bitter
finish
a
must
for
the
style
a
great
lighter
beer
to
go
with
must
food
particularly
seasoned
poultry
overall
this
is
very
good
and
easily
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
kind
of
beer
in
a
session
without
much
issue
if
only
it
werent
so
pricey
and
more
available
d
we
are
getting
into
some
seriously
sessionable
terms
here
big
on
complexity
big
flavor
and
feel
and
little
on
abv
adds
up
to
some
pretty
impressive
drinkablility
if
only
i
were
in
germany
this
beer
might
be
a
little
more
reasonable
to
have
a
massive
supply
of
very
well
carbonated
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
great
example
of
the
alt
style
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
a
rare
treat
pours
chestnut
brown
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
and
sticky
lacing
smells
like
a
freshly
cleaned
stable
sweet
hay
and
a
touch
of
earth
and
wood
as
well
as
fresh
grains
some
light
malt
throughout
as
well
the
taste
is
similar
with
predominant
notes
of
hay
and
cereal
grains
as
well
as
some
light
malt
smooth
toasty
and
malty
quite
dry
and
easy
to
drink
nice
to
try
this
on
tap
ill
try
it
fresh
one
day
but
ill
be
extremely
nervous
when
i
do
d
i
liked
this
one
the
best
of
the
3
and
found
it
the
most
complex
i
will
preface
this
review
with
this
i
have
never
had
an
altbier
before
and
also
this
is
my
first
ba
review
so
with
that
said
i
had
this
wonderful
beer
at
the
brickstore
pub
in
decatur
ga
yesterday
it
was
served
to
me
in
proper
glassware
a
2l
glass
with
the
breweries
name
printed
on
it
small
was
of
sweet
malt
which
is
something
i
normally
dont
like
i
would
also
say
that
i
was
almost
put
off
cause
it
had
a
hint
of
skunkyness
to
it
once
i
tasted
it
thought
the
thought
of
that
was
quickly
gone
it
had
a
very
nice
caramel
taste
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
round
it
out
the
aftertaste
was
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
some
kind
of
warm
fruit
thats
just
not
distinguishable
to
me
overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
will
be
wanting
again
soon
i
might
have
to
find
a
homebrew
recipe
for
this
so
i
can
always
have
some
on
the
shelf
overall
i
was
impressed
i
believe
this
is
only
my
second
altbier
and
the
first
wasnt
as
true
to
the
style
as
this
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
d
low
abv
good
taste
makes
this
a
winner
in
my
book
overall
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
a
definite
letdown
in
that
it
just
didnt
have
much
if
any
character
this
was
not
a
terrible
beer
or
anything
like
that
but
its
just
not
worth
another
visit
overall
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
brew
i
will
definitely
pick
it
up
again
d
nice
hopmalt
balance
had
some
bratwurst
and
spätzle
earlier
in
the
evening
ill
bet
this
would
have
made
a
great
pairing
next
time
very
well
done
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
theres
a
bit
of
substance
but
still
on
the
watery
side
overall
a
very
good
alt
that
lives
up
to
its
reputation
not
thin
smooth
some
tannic
astringency
lively
carbonation
pours
a
nice
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
nice
dense
cream
colored
head
that
left
some
insane
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
a
rich
nutty
malt
a
bit
buttery
and
a
hint
of
steel
the
taste
is
very
malty
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
prevail
some
mineral
water
and
a
light
but
noticable
hoppy
bitterness
towards
the
end
perhaps
a
very
very
light
fruitiness
as
well
the
feel
is
light
and
almost
watery
fairly
soft
carbonation
and
finishes
bitter
from
the
malt
and
hops
a
great
looking
altbier
with
a
nice
roasty
malt
taste
the
feel
was
a
bit
thin
but
that
is
the
only
real
negative
recommended
for
those
who
like
chewing
lemon
rinds
what
an
enjoyable
beer
i
bet
this
beer
is
incredible
fresh
its
easy
to
drink
a
good
session
ale
recommended
d
its
very
good
no
doubt
but
i
feel
im
fuchschen
just
shades
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
dept
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
great
but
with
the
import
price
this
is
one
id
overlook
the
next
time
around
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
hint
of
ruby
nose
is
a
mix
of
old
fruit
skins
slightly
sweet
in
a
mature
fashion
flavor
is
tangy
a
touch
of
kick
from
spice
on
the
tongue
overall
it
seems
a
bit
like
grapefruit
skins
tamer
though
feel
is
nice
good
level
of
bubble
definitely
drinkable
very
smooth
just
dont
know
how
to
compare
it
to
other
altbiers
since
this
is
my
first
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
excellent
representation
of
style
mild
kick
this
is
a
very
good
beer
in
a
style
that
many
brewers
seem
either
reluctant
to
do
or
unable
to
do
well
if
i
want
a
beer
with
some
substance
that
isnt
going
to
be
overpowering
this
is
an
excellent
choice
too
bad
its
such
an
expensive
one
a
well
balanced
beer
that
was
pleasant
to
drink
d
perhaps
this
will
be
more
drinkable
in
person
i
will
have
to
make
an
effort
to
have
it
on
tap
in
deutschland
next
year

interesting
beer
from
a
style
that
i
have
rarely
the
opportunity
to
try
great
alt
its
good
in
a
bottle
but
if
you
have
a
chance
its
a
totally
different
experience
drinking
a
fresh
glass
at
the
brewpub
drinkability
is
decent
a
solid
alcohol
presence
will
not
sit
right
with
new
beer
lovers
but
the
brew
is
very
rich
well
balanced
and
has
perfect
concentration
cheers

with
excellent
clarity
and
a
tenacious

leaves
plenty

up
in

complexity

firmbutmild
tea
like
bitterness
starts
things
off
and
moves
further
back
on
the
tongue
gaining
in
power
through
the
palate
the
malts
start
to
round
out
at
the
midpalate
displaying
some
nice
chewiness
and
depth
before
the
finish
dries
out
in
hoppy
glory
mouthfeel
is
pretty
heavy
on
carbonation
but
its
soft
carbonation
that
feels
pretty
natural
good
weight
for
sessioning
in
spite
of
the
slightly
high
abv
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
drunk
fresh
this
is
a
stellar
example
of
a
drastically
underappreciated
style
interesting
drinkable
refreshing
excellent
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
tealike
wouldnt
be
too
far
off
the
carbonation
is
visible
but
its
not
felt
as
much
very
easy
to
quaff
this
cost
may
prevent
an
all
out
session
though
bottle
opens
with
a
not
too
enthused
pop
and
pours
almost
still
there
is
a
very
thin
layer
of
bubbles
atop
the
strong
iced
tea
body
smells
of
toasty
malt
caramel
toffee
and
some
herbal
hops
kind
of
like
a
clean

flavor

lots
of
bread
honey
dried
figs
nuts
toffee
caramel
along
with
tea
minty
herbs
perfume
and
toast
finishes
a
touch
dry
and
with
a
yeastiness
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
in
weight
but
the
carbonation
is
dull
very
delicious
but
im
afraid
i
must
have
gotten
a
bottle
with
a
faulty
cap
but
i
cant
really
detect
any
oxidation
so
who
knows
a
well
done
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
overall
a
very
unique
and
tasty
beer
certainly
something
i
would
like
to
revisit
d
not
bad
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
its
superb
cousins
extremely
drinkable
with
the
very
modest
abv
d
great
drinkability
is
found
in
the
low
alcohol
session
worthy
ale
the
alt
has
a
nice
fruity
essence
with
spice
hop
and
pleasing
carbonation
adding
balance
the
flavor
is
dark
fruit
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
actually
a
fair
amount
of
hop
presence
as
compared
to
the
other
alts
or
doppelbocks
i
think
the
hops
are
a
little
peppery
and
maybe
a
little
citric
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
oily
from
the
hops
thick
and
viscous
though
great
brew
i
prefer
this
one
to
the
other
ueriges
for
drinkability
although
for
4
5
its
not
the
easiestdrinking
beer
the
body
is
medium
and
very
creamy
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
carbonation
that
sharpens
the
palate
it
would
probably
help
to
define
the
hops
a
bit
more
but
it
feels
nice
and
slick
the
finish
has
a
very
light
hint
of
alcohol
burn
still
quite
drinkable
despite
the
slight
oxidization
i
love
me
some
altbier

the
sticke
and
to
a
slightly
lesser
extent
the
doppelsticke
if
only
there
were
more
commercial
examples
of
the
style
that
were
readily
available
to
me
but
i
am
quite
impressed
with
uerige

taste

then
the

the

for

bitterness
is
high
so
that
outbalances
the
beer
a

mainly
hops

are
the
main

bitterness
is

an

to

the

builds
almost
to
the
point

being

is
switches

i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
really
interesting
flavour
ill
definitely
have
this
again
this
alt
pours
into
my
mug
an
orangeygolden
color
with
some
cloudiness
and
thin
but
persistent
white
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
rather
sweet
that
of
caramel
type
malt
and
maybe
a
sherry
aroma
judging
by
this
and
the
bottle
date
the
beer
may
be
a
bit
over
the
hill
well
see
i
cannot
detect
much
of
any
hop
aroma
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
quite
complex
there
are
elements
of
malty
sweetness
that
of
fruit
and
bready
notes
the
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
and
balances
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
nicely
after
the
swallow
the
beer
leaves
my
mouth
rather
dry
with
a
moderatelow
hop
taste
present
definitely
wanting
another
sip
the
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
rather
highly
carbonated
yet
is
incredibly
smooth
overall
i
truly
enjoyed
this
one
not
as
much
as
the
uerige
sticke
but
this
was
very
good
i
like
the
flavor
of
the
beer
best
along
with
the
aftertaste
it
really
leaves
you
perfectly
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
and
not
too
dry
but
rather
the
perfect
mix
of
the
three
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
sample
sometime
and
see
if
the
aroma
is
any
different
id
recommend
this
beer
and
if
i
ever
make
to
germany
i
will
visit
uerige
the

the

i

fell
in

with
back

i

frequented
the
local

in

ne
i
dont
think
ive
had
another
one
that
i
can
remember
for
several
years
now
and
im
ashamed

that

an

really
nice
this
is
probably
one
of
the
standards
if
not
the
standard
of
the
style
and
it
shows
why
light
but
complex
and
very
flavorfulkick
ass
pours
a
clear
and
almost
lager
like
amger
but
not
a
lot
of
bubbles
and
a
crappy
head
and
no
residual
foam
during
the
drinking
a
par
mix
or
toasted
malts
byt
very
hard
to
pick
up
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
just
a
bit
easier
to
pick
up
a
very
lagery
bread
crust
tase
with
some
carbonation
that
is
tasted
but
not
seen
a
very
lager
feel
to
the
palate
as
well
crsip
and
refreshing
drinks
okay
maybe
this
beer
is
tired
i
do
know
this
tasted
much
malty
sweeter
the
on
one
evening
i
spent
at
the
brewery
in
duddeldorf
would
try
again
if
i
was
sure
i
getting
fresher
beer
md
softly
fizzy
on
the
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
and
pretty
clean
on
the
texture
so
that
the
bitterness
roams
free
all
over
the
palate
the
beer
surely
the
bitterest
german
beer
ive
had
shows
an
equivalent
length
and
depth
like
a
really
good
english
best
bitter
albeit
much
milder
in
fruitiness
and
cleaner
in
texture
and
added
with
a
woody
touch
that
is
seldom
imparted
to
most
bitters
nowadays
im
surprised
to
find
it
so
thirstquenching
and
quaffable
compared
to
schumacher
alt
that
i
tasted
at
the
gbbf
this
year
stillaged
this
beer
to
schumacher
is
like
a
dryhopped
best
bitter
to
a
fruitymalty
premium
bitter
if
this
weird
comparison
makes
sense
if
its
available
on
casktap
a
little
more
often
in
this
country
ill
certainly
know
where
to
look
to
get
a
perfect
alternative
to
my
bitters
lovely
nectar
this
is
but
damn
i
shouldve
bought
a
case
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
but
its
not
good
i
wouldnt
buy
it
or
recommend
it
this
beer
tastes
like
carcinogens
and
death
down
the
drain
13
of
the
way
into
it
cheers
joe
prost
beertracker
d
i
dont
know
how
many
of
these
i
could
polish
off
in
one
night
i
would
say
two
maximum
its
pretty
roasty
which
i
personally
can
only
take
so
much
of
before
they
all
start
to
taste
the
same
a
very
good
beer
in
moderation
very
drinkable
however
too
pricey
to
have
very
many
of
them
rare
as
hens
teeth
in
colorado
thanks
to
indys
shbobdb
for
hooking
me
up
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
malt
notes
but
they
are
very
light
and
could
be
a
bit
more
bold
an
excellent
beer
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
beer
that
is
so
good
but
man
is
it
ever
good
words
fail
when
describing
this
beer
wickedly
cool
bottle
will
save
for
homebrew
my
first
uerige
product
and
i
hope
to
try
the
stronger
versions
of
this
as
well
pours

slightly
cloudy

orangecopper
topped
by
a
firm
thick
cushion
of

flecked
with

of

this
is
a
good
looking
beer
nose
is
full
of

backed
by
a
spicy

nicely
doughy
sweet

up

but
quickly
give
way
to
toasted

spicy

dry

the
most
bitter
alt
ive
had
and
probably
the
driest
finishing
nice
the
hop
bitterness
is
tasty
too
floral
and
herbal
the
finish
as
ive
mentioned
is
dry
with
winks
of
cookieish
malt
over
bitter
minerals
mediumbodied
exceedingly
drinkable
id
love
to
try
this
ontap
at
the
source
this
one
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
fruitiness
and
has
some
grain
character
there
is
a
lot
more
grain
character
in
the
flavor
also
the
fruits
are
there
along
with
some
spicy
hop
flavor
finish
is
spicy
and
slightly
bitter
and
the
drinkability
is
good
rather
light
bodied
sessionable
if
you
have
the
money
a
bit
pricey

very
toasty
with
lighter
raisiney
notes
hiding
behind
it
there
is
a
big
toffee
sweetness
in
it
as
well
flavor
is
very
interesting
the
hops
are
much
more
dominant
here
than
in
the
nose
with
a
light
toastyness
and
a
moderate
raisin
hops
is
grassy
and
herbal
in
flavor
with
a
pretty
healthy
bitterness
i
like
it
feel
is
moderate
with
a
carbonation
on
the
lighter
end
of
moderate
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
pretty
nice
brew
im
not
overly
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
id
have
it
again
one
day
hopefully
while
in
germany
to
see
what
it
is
like
without
a
trip
across
the
ocean
as
its
nice
now
but
i
bet
better
over
there

is
medium
well
carbonated

mouthfeel

this

provides
creamy

with
pleasant
lingering
sweetness
lovely
anytime
bitter
and
full
of
flavor
is
what
the
tongue
signalises
but
also
moreish
is
the
tortured
translation
that
appears
on
the
uerige
website
i
couldnt
have
said
it
better
after
learning
that
classic
is
the
lower
malt
lower
hops
lower
alcohol
version
of
sticke
i
envisioned
myself
saying
something
along
the
lines
of
its
good
but
ill
sticke
with
the
bigger
beer
well
im
here
to
say
that
the
little
guy
has
nothing
to
apologize
for
as
far
as
im
concerned
uerige
obergarige
hausbrauerei
brews
the
definitive
versions
of
the
altbier
style
the
beer
was
a
little
cloudy
which
was
kind
of
offputting
but
it
may
be
ok
since
its
an
older
beer
style
im
not
sure
if
it
was
bottle
conditioned
or
not
color
wise
i
get
a
coppery
brown
tint
and
a
decent
offwhite
head
the
aroma
gives
me
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
as
well
as
some
yeasty
notes
the
latter
surprises
me
some
since
i
thought
alts
were
kind
of
wellaged
and
smoother
i
also
get
some
nice
dark
germanstyle
malts
some
caramel
and
some
graininess
allinall
they
blend
nicely
the
flavor
is
killer
in
my
opinion
its
smooth
yes
but
also
complex
with
nice
bitterness
in
the
end
and
an
easy
maltiness
as
well
that
attacks
your
tongue
and
blends
with
some
hop
flavor
notes
too
this
is
great
in
my
opinion
the
beer
is
rather
unique
and
thats
hard
to
say
in
these
days
only
because
we
have
so
many
great
beers
available
since
the
craft
brew
revolution
overall
i
would
prefer
a
fuller
rounder
drink
from
an
alt
is
that
off
base
overall
quite
a
nice
alt
but
theres
not
really
much
comparison
to
their
doppelsticke
i
tried
last
week
still
worth
seeking
out
and
a
pleasant
surprise
in
the
supercool
bottle
drinkability
and
overall
what
a
fabulously
rich
and
complex
brew
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
the
complexity
is
ridiculous
for
a
beer
thats
4
5
unreal
kills
any
american
altbier
ive
ever
had
great
stuff
great
looking
fliptop
bottle
with
a
long
thin
neck
bottle
on
41405
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
its
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
two
fingers
of
foamy
offwhite
head
and
very
good
retention
smell
is
a
thick
biscuit
malt
with
a
detectable
floral
hops
and
a
slight
nuttiness
as
well
taste
is
slightly
sweet
upfront
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
with
a
large
bitter
grassy
hop
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
middle
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
with
great
taste
and
low
alcohol
only
the
cost
keeps
me
from
drinking
these
all
the
time
slightly
used
copper
penny
with
a
foamy
head
that
falls
to
a
ring
some
laving
and
sporadic
bubbling
served
in
a
collins
glass
smell
is
burnt
biscuits
with
a
nutty
essence
just
beneath
the
surface
taste
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
malt
sweetness
especially
in
the
middle
and
hop
bitterness
like
biorhythms
meeting
above
the
lifeline
the
cylindrical
glass
is
perfect
for
capturing
the
nose
and
then
quafffing
a
swallow
tasty
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
with
a
body
to
match
this
is
a
fun
drinking
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
suggest
more
than
3
or
4
in
a
setting
i
might
use
it
as
a
balancing
beer
between
a
malty
brew
and
one
that
is
predominately
hoppy
drinkability

this
is
a
little
bigger
than
i
prefer
my
altbiers
but
it
sure
lives
up
to
its
billing
if
you
want
to
try
an
altbier
on
steroids
than
this
is
it
you
could
probably
even
cellar
this
is
you
wanted
taste
pretty
straightforward
but
nice
the
malt
hit
huge
upfront
but
it
wasnt
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
there
was
a
little
bit
of
molasses
at
first
but
this
quickly
transformed
into
a
strong
nuttiness
that
was
a
dry
and
husky
then
a
nice
slightly
herbal
hops
bitterness
arose
to
balance
things
out
a
little
bit
of
dark
cherry
hung
out
underneath
the
other
flavors
much
drier
and
huskier
than
i
was
expecting
nice
definately
one
of
the
best
altbiers
ive
had
and
truly
a
solid
example
of
this
often
overlooked
style
what
a
wonderful
session
beer
if
only
it
was
not
4
a
bottle
uerige
is
dark
copper
in
color
with
a
moderate
head
size
rentention
is
pretty
good
the
aroma
is
weak
and
somewhat
uninteresting
a
light
carmel
smell
underlies
a
slightly
stronger
herbal
body
the
main
taste
here
is
of
herbal
hops
caramel
malts
are
faintly
tasted
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
fairly
active
due
to
the
herbal
elements
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
however
this
isnt
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
i
think
i
liked
uerige
sticke
better
coppery
color
and
crystal
clear
body
with
a
nearly
white
thin
cap
of
foam
aroma
is
herbal
hops
and
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
flavor
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
clean
finish
malt
sweetness
lies
just
below
the
herbal
hop
and
fruity
tastes
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
but
not
at
all
watery
interesting
brew
that
begs
you
to
drink
more
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
it
has
a
refreshingly
fruity
yeast
aroma
that
is
quite
pleasant
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
light
and
bitter
flavor
that
is
loaded
with
hops
and
balanced
with
light
crystal
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
altbier
its
light
and
bitter
and
highly
drinkable
the
persistant
hoppy
finish
sloughs
off
the
palate
ready
for
the
next

very
dry

witch
goes
well
wit
the
amount
of

just
what
you
want
in
a
altbeer
so
perfect
again
mouthfeel
is
great
too
all
your

are
just
gonna
be
in
tilt
after
a
couple
of

except
for
the

ones
who
dont

at
all
dinkability
is
perfect
again
if
you
like
burnt
and
bitter
taste
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
this
altbier
poured
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
was
very
persistent
and
clung
to
the
glass
there
was
a
good
steady
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
nicely
malty
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
was
hoppy
up
front
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
there
were
some
fruity
malty
flavors
and
a
slight
bitterness
and
hoppiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
aftertaste
was
both
malty
and
hoppy
and
it
lingered
pleasantly
this
was
a
very
nice
altbier
dark
brown
with
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
aromas
are
a
bit
weaker
than
the
sticke
but
still
consists
of
nuts
spices
floralherbal
hops
and
more
the
taste
is
hoppy
up
front
and
malty
in
the
middle
witha
good
balance
of
the
spicynuttiniess
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
thin
for
me
but
drinkability
is
very
good
despite
its
short
comings
this
is
still
damn
nice
it
will
live
in
the
shadows
when
compared
to
the
sticke
though
imo
in
my
experience
alts
are
best
drunk
fresh
as
possible
as
in
from
a
gravity
cask
in
front
of
the
brewery
in
the
altstadt
in
dusseldorf
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
slender
altbier
glass
it
pours
a
brilliant
deep
copper
color
with
three
fingers
of
head
sticky
lacing
is
left
all
over
the
glass
the
smell
is
rich
and
malty
lots
of
sweet
caramel
aromas
coming
through
just
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
as
well
the
taste
is
full
of
caramel
maltiness
at
first
slightly
toasty
the
finish
is
very
hoppy
i
was
really
surprised
at
the
amount
of
hops
in
this
one
considering
the
sticke
has
more
hops
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
i
really
need
to
get
my
ass
to
düsseldorf
to
try
this
super
fresh
drinkability
interesting
beer
that
was
nice
to
try
a
bit
too
expensive
for
what
i
got
though
i
think
it
was
between
45
glad
i
tried
it
though
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pinkish
copper
shouldnt
an
alt
be
darker
under
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
to
chunky
film
leaving
a
lot
of
good
lace
potential
that
remains
unfortunately
unfulfilled
the
nose
is
mild
with
sweet
malt
the
overriding
characteristic
the
mouth
is
mildly
carbonated
and
fairly
light
the
flavor
follows
suit
at
first
with
lots
of
sweet
slightly
caramel
malt
up
front
backed
by
very
little
hops
character
at
all
the
bitterness
builds
steadily
though
rather
like
ravels
bolero
the
hops
are
flowery
in
essence
with
a
twinge
of
carnation
into
the
finish
the
crescendo
comes
in
the
aftertaste
as
a
wave
of
good
strong
espresso
flavor
rolls
across
the
tongue
and
down
the
throat
some
1015
seconds
after
the
liquid
is
gone
remarkable
for
its
punch
this
is
a
very
nice
and
unusual
beer
the
initial
taste
is
extremely
dry
with
some
mild
caramel
afterwards
long
lingering
spicy
hop
flavors
develop
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
drank
very
soon
after
bottling
like
within
a
month
since
the
bottle
i
had
was
made
in
april
and
its
now
november
i
think
a
lot
of
flavor
was
lost
due
to
time
a
delay
long
lingering
spicy
hops
update
as
of
020206
i
got
another
bottle
of
classic
like
my
first
bottle
review
above
it
shows
a
little
age
i
am
not
going
to
adjust
any
of
the
numbers
or
really
write
a
new
review
i
will
say
i
can
reaffirm
the
already
known
this
is
a
damn
tasty
alt
i
want
nothing
more
then
a
stunningly
fresh
bottle
ill
try
again
very
nice
brown
color
with
a
very
generous
level
of
carbonation
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
sweetnessalmost
a
touch
of
cinnamon
in
the
backround
flavor
is
mostly
maltslight
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
very
slight
metallic
aftertaste
but
its
not
unpleasant
good
body
a
drinkable
beerwell
worth
trying
after
hearing
about
it
for
years
i
would
love
to
get
to
germany
for
the
real
thing
on
tap
came
in
a
very
interseting
bottle
with
the
option
to
reseal
its
only
11
ounces
so
why
would
i
anyway
the
color
was
redcopper
and
sealed
on
top
with
a
one
or
two
inch
white
bubbly
head
a
quiet
fruit
aroma
dark
fruit
like
passion
fruit
or
a
plum
followed
by
a

the
taste
was
above

the
hops
and
malt
played
well
together
very

of
the
plum
hops
and
slight
caramel
a
well
to

and
a

this
a

take
control

decent

the
taste
comes
off
as

lots
of
fresh
tasting

lend
a
herbal
and
floral
bitterness
that
combine
very
well
with
the

varieties
used
in
this
dusseldorf
gem
no
hint
of
alcohol
but
none
expected
at

a
very
refreshing
and
very
enjoyable
altbier
the
hops
never
overwhelm
and
lend
an
ideal
balance
that
results
in
a
clasic
alt
very
drinkable
this
came
in
a
nifty
looking
slim
neck
bottle
with
a
swing
top
this
poured
a
murky
brownish
amber
color
with
about
2
inches
of
off
white
head
as
the
head
eventually
dropped
this
left
good
sized
sheets
of
lace
all
around
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
a
roasted
grain
and
slightly
sweet
malt
there
was
a
small
earth
toned
hop
presence
that
added
to
the
scent
to
the
scent
as
well
taste
was
of
sweet
caramel
malt
backed
with
more
doughy
malt
hops
gave
it
a
slightly
bitter
after
taste
the
taste
was
very
clean
and
dry
which
left
you
wanted
more
each
time
you
took
a
sip
pretty
impressive
taste
for
the
size
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
nicely
carbonated
feel
to
it
this
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
would
make
a
perfect
sessionable
brew
having
tried
this
has
definitely
peaked
my
interest
in
the
style
highly
recommended
sweet
malty
aroma
with
dark
fruits
making
hints
at
you
plums
and
figs
mainly
very
appetizing
hops
arent
present
ot
me
at
all
very
clean
and
dry
tasting
somewhat
dissapointing
the
aroma
leads
to
expect
so
much
more
from
this
beer
obviously
it
doesnt
seem
to
travel
to
well
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
center
and
a
rather
silent
finish
very
drinkable
but
if
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smells
fresh
than
id
give
it
a
5
its
ok
to
try
once
but
nothing
i
get
regularly
unless
i
was
at
the
source
reddish
in
color
with
a
copper
hue
medium
white
head
floats
above
lacing
is
minimal
smell
is
more
sweet
than
bitter
but
i
get
some
hops
there
along
with
a
bready
yeasty
flavor
but
in
the
taste
the
hops
are
the
dominate
flavor
these
hops
are
not
bitter
at
all
but
really
really
flavorful
they
have
a
floral
taste
and
a
piney
flavor
honey
sweetness
lures
behind
the
hops
a
hazelnut
base
flavor
comes
from
the
yeast
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
but
leaves
just
enough
hoppiness
for
me
to
want
more
to
me
this
is
the
ultimate
session
beer
the
hops
are
very
flavorful
but
not
overly
so
the
balance
is
quite
amazing
and
more
flavors
seem
to
come
out
the
more
i
try
this
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
classic
pours
an
orangishbrown
hue
with
a
smaill
white
head
minimal
retention
sweet
smell
of
roasted
malt
and
toffee
probably
muted
because
i
didnt
let
this
bottle
properly
warm
up
very
complex
palate
holds
notes
of
roasted
malt
brown
sugar
and
light
hops
finish
is
bitter
and
slightly
smoky
like
a
rauchbier
nice
sturdy
creamy
body
a
fairly
unique
beer
unlike
most
americanbrewed
alts
despite
the
initial
enthusiastic
unleashing
of
trapped
gasses
this
brew
soon
lost
most
of
its
fizz
and
remained
largely
inactive
throughout
my
tasting
this
fast
release
and
prolonged
stillness
goes
a
long
way
towards
explaining
the
flux
in
flavors
the
beer
poured
a
copper
color
and
formed
a
nice
small
bubbly
white
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
a
very
small
stream
of
carbonation
was
present
a
heavy
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
with
floral
and
caramel
elements
with
a
slightly
nutty
aspect
a
flavor
of
malt
lightly
of
caramel
and
a
nice
hop
aspect
that
relects
well
in
the
astrigent
bitter
finish
of
this
beer
not
quite
up
to
the
classic
but
still
a
great
beer
pours
a
lightly
hazy
ruby
color
topped
by
a
cream
colored
head
a
clean
sweet
malty
aroma
greats
my
nose
i
also
get
some
grassy
herbal
hoppy
notes
i
get
hints
of
pine
flowers
and
candied
orange
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
washed
out
than
the
nose
suggests
though
when
tasted
on
draft
at
the
source
this
is
a
completely
different
beer
it
has
a
nice
clean
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
bitterness
is
preceded
by
a
somewhat
muted
hop
flavor
that
adds
a
bit
of
fruitiness
to
this
beer
which
shows
what
this
beer
could
be
like
if
sampled
fresh
at
the
brewery
does
have
a
nice
level
of
maltiness
here
that
is
reminiscent
of
biscuits
with
a
bit
of
caramel
in
it
it
almost
unfortunate
that
this
is
imported
this
beer
loses
so
much
by
leaving
its
home
pub
if
you
really
want
to
try
this
and
see
that
it
is
a
completely
different
beer
go
to
the
altstadt
of
düsseldorf
the
bottle
came
with
a
caveat
from
the
vendor
belmont
station
to
be
drunk
very
cold
not
to
let
it
warm
up
this
seemed
strange
to
me
and
perhaps
the
first
warning
sign
that
this
sample
was
not
all
it
could
be
the
beer
pours
a
shadowy
waxy
amber
with
a
substantial
head
that
melts
away
and
leaves
a
small
amount
of
intricate
lace
on
the
glass
nearly
invisible
musty
aroma
which
had
all
the
fleeting
substance
of
a
disremembered
dream
some
caramel
malts
up
front
tempered
with
a
winey
roundness
a
gentle
nutty
flavor
and
a
light
apple
quality
a
deepdown
roastiness
reveals
itself
reluctantly
but
adds
a
twinge
of
smoke
and
perhaps
coffee
the
taste
in
itself
actually
seems
a
bit
hollow
with
a
rolling
grassy
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
makes
up
a
large
part
of
the
flavor
i
found
this
to
be
an
intriguing
enveloping
beer
and
was
impressed
by
many
of
its
complexities
but
it
wasnt
as
likeable
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
this
bottle
is
the
second
time
ive
tried
the
beer
the
first
was
a
disastrously
sour
cask
served
at
the
horse
brass
based
on
the
elusiveness
of
this
bottled
sample
i
can
only
conclude
that
the
beer
is
best
when
absolutely
fresh
and
travelling
across
both
the
atlantic
ocean
and
the
continental
u
s
has
done
this
beer
absolutely
no
favors
a
11
2
oz
bottle
that
is
dated
as
being
bottled
on
41404
pours
a
cardboard
brown
leaving
a
three
finger
head
that
is
quite
pillowy
and
foamy
first
sip
wow
a
wonderful
hops
taste
that
remains
on
the
edges
of
the
tongue
not
a
bitter
hops
taste
but
a
green
taste
i
had
a
local
version
of
alt
beer
and
it
was
much
more
watery
and
thin
with
little
hops
flavor
this
has
a
little
more
depth
and
something
going
on
with
the
hops
when
i
take
a
bit
more
of
a
bigger
sip
and
swish
it
around
i
get
a
malty
taste
that
is
present
but
goes
away
much
more
quickly
i
have
avoided
getting
some
imports
lately
as
they
seem
to
go
stale
by
the
time
they
get
here
but
this
one
tastes
very
good
in
spite
of
being
stored
out
of
a
cooler
the
swingtop
popped
loudly
and
i
thought
i
might
have
a
gusher
so
i
quickly
poured
this
ale
and
it
revealed
a
rich
nutbrown
color
with
a
white
head
that
was
thin
yet
resilient
it
has
a
caramel
aroma
and
a
very
interesting
flavor
it
begins
very
smoothly
with
sweet
malt
flavors
which
slowly
segue
into
a
strong
hop
background
that
lingers
and
leaves
the
most
wonderful
hop
flavor
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
flavor
and
i
was
surprised
by
the
delicate
earthiness
of
the
german
hops
thanks
to
cokes
for
yet
another
uerige
altbier
love
the
bottle
for
this
one
a
work
of
art
now
the
beer
lovelly
looking
ale
it
is
an
almost
glowing
amber
with
a
huge
sticky
frothy
off
white
head
great
lacing
aroma
is
strong
on
the
malts
some
small
hops
too
very
soft
malty
flavour
semi
dry
finish
some
hints
of
honey
and
a
small
hoppiness
at
the
very
end
very
nice
on
the
palate
not
the
biggest
beer
in
the
world
but
certainly
a
top
class
alt
pours
a
rich
copper
with
an
off
white
head
that
lingers
a
little
longer
than
a
good
night
kiss
smells
more
malty
than
its
cousin
the
uerige
sticke
taste
is
also
more
malty
classic
alt
style
brew
with
nice
brown
ale
caramel
and
toast
notes
not
nearly
as
hoppy
in
the
finish
as
the
sticke
but
its
pretty
darn
tasty
more
in
line
with
the
tradional
alt
style
i
prefer
the
sticke
but
the
classic
proved
worth
the
price
pair
it
with
some
smoked
gouda
or
smoked
almonds
for
a
tasty
treat
ok
now
i
think
i
understand
altbiers
this
is
much
better
than
anything
ive
yet
had
but
ill
take
a
wild
guess
its
taste
is
extravagantly
even
better
fresh
in
dusseldorf
yeah
so
this
bottle
aint
fresh
but
ill
be
damned
if
it
aint
good
thanks
to
trbeer
for
the
extra
bottle
both
are
galaxyclass
ng
gratitude
aplenty
towards
moulefrite
for
the
bottles
ok
i
have
got
the
last
bit
of
a
small
glass
of
uerige
classic
been
enjoying
this
for
about
an
hour
or
so
beer
is
the
color
of
clear
iced
tea
ive
had
it
out
for
so
long
now
all
head
and
traces
of
it
have
vanished
aroma
is
of
rich
malt
maybe
a
hint
of
some
alcohol
taste
is
pretty
much
all
bitter
juicy
hop
goodness
with
some
ripe
fruit
and
maybe
a
few
tootsie
rolls
thrown
into
the
wort
the
hop
juicyness
lingers
for
a
bit
it
makes
your
mouth
water
pleasantly
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
remarkably
long
lasting
compared
to
so
many
other
beers
it
really
does
linger
glad
to
have
another
german
archtypical
beer
to
review
poured
from
a
cask
gravity
keg
it
is
a
seethorugh
brown
in
color
the
color
of
stained
wood
it
matched
the
bar
there
was
no
head
and
no
lace
product
of
the
gravity
keg
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
on
the
tongue
it
definitely
came
across
as
stronger
than
the
6
listed
here
by
the
taste
but
not
sure
about
the
effect
hops
were
slightly
noticeable
but
they
were
woven
around
a
fruity
flavor
but
not
particularly
sweet
bit
of
a
bite
the
alcohol
flavor
seemed
to
prevail
over
all
else
it
would
be
a
good
sipping
beer
and
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
really
something
i
would
go
looking
for
in
the
future
poured
into
a
middle
ages
imperial
half
pint
glass
formed
a
thick
12
light
toffee
head
over
a
clear
caramelhued
brew
laced
well
aroma
is
lightly
of
yeast
and
malts
taste
is
light
malts
upfront
with
hops
dominating
the
latter
portion
of
the
flavor
expected
a
bit
deeper
malt
character
but
what
do
i
know
note
as
it
warmed
a
nutty
characteristic
became
more
pronounced
nice
mouthfeel
excellent
and
drinkability
is
endless
maybe
i
can
get
a
friend
stioned
in
the
air
force
in
germany
to
bring
me
back
some
fresh
uerige
so
i
can
see
how
it
can
possibly
be
even
better

in

purchased
at

in
chapel
hill
nc
i
have
had
both
the
bottle
and
a
gravity
fed
cask
at
the
old
bay
in
new
brunswick
have
to
say
that
i
think
both
were
outstanding
this
brew
has
a
nice
deep
orange
color
with
a
tannish
head
the
aroma
has
that
peppery
character
that
you
get
with
a
true
alt
yeast
strain
flavor
is
very
big
for
a
4
5
beer
with
the
malt
and
hops
doing
battle
to
the
end
easy
to
drink
if
not
tough
to
find
as
long
as
you
like
it
herb
zehr
trocken
or
in
other
words
as
dry
as
an
espressocovered
pine
forest
note
dont
try
this
one
after
having
something
big
the
nuances
of
the
beer
are
hidden
if
your
palate
has
been
exhausted
by
something
like
an
imperial
stout
good
lord
this
is
a
pretty
glass
of
suds
just
got
in
a
case
of
this
rather
hard
to
come
by
brew
and
am
pleased
as
punch
and
speaking
of
punch
this
baby
gives
a
champagne
like
burst
when
opened
from
its
slumber
in
its
awesome
flip
top
format
the
color
is
of
the
purest
copper
and
a
sticky
head
with
gracious
stick
and
lace
adds
to
the
very
elegant
picture
a
real
treasure
to
behold
ahh
and
the
aromas
here
are
pure
magicclean
as
a
whistle
with
fresh
breadymalty
nuances
gentle
fruity
esters
and
magestic
hop
notes
to
boot
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crispquite
dry
and
the
finish
is
rather
hoppy
is
this
the
ultimate
session
beer
or
what
them
damn
germans
know
how
to
make
beer
honestly
i
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
for
the
style
semi
dark
brown
colored

body
with
a
thick
off
white
head
this
alt
covered
all
the
spectrums
of
the
other
alts
i
had
in
dusseldorf
had
a
good
hop
nose
from
dry
hopping
mixed
in
with
a
leathery
dank
basement
smell
from
the
wooden
kegs
malty
sweet
but
clean
in
the
back
of
the
throat
in
the
beginning
with
a
fresh
hop
flavor
coming
through
in
the
middle
strong
hop
presence
in
the
bittering
which
left
the
mouth
feeling
dry
and
the
tounge
just
a
touch
burned
out
from
the
hops
the
best
one
i
had
in
dusseldorf
tried
this
beer
twice
the
first
one
mightve
been
an
old
batch
because
it
was
kinda
sour
but
the
last
one
i
had
taste
great
it
was
malty
with
a
nice
semi
sweet
finish
ill
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
these
in
the
future
nothing
special
pretty
average
wow
perfection

a
glass

a
superb

my
new
go
to
beer
it
is
a
beer
that
will
not
kill
you
on
the
booze
but
still
maintains
enough
balance
perfection
i
just
wish
i
could
find
it
more
readily
available
poured
on
tap
in
a
shaker
the
beer
is
a
deep
vibrant
copper
coloring
aromas
of
subtle
caramel
and
roasted
notes
very
balanced
and
light
flavors
are
extremely
balanced
and
smooth
with
caramel
and
nut
highlights
blending
perfectly
smooth
light
body
with
a
caramel
sweet
linger
in
the
aftertaste
finish
is
light
and
crisp
insanely
balanced
and
immensely
drinkable
o
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
altbiers
i
have
ever
had
it
is
full
of
such
bright
fruity
notes
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
with
super
high
drinkability
this
amazing
altbier
or
brown
ale
caught
my
attention
just
for
being
different
i
wasam
new
to
mecklenburg
and
not
expecting
alot
gave
it
a
shot
what
i
got
was
an
amazing
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
and
also
a
member
of
a
brewery
i
look
forward
to
exploring
its
dark
red
appearance
really
lets
you
know
your
drinking
a
great
beer
while
its
smell
is
not
strong
i
will
happily
overlook
this
factor
its
mouth
feel
is
amazing
probably
the
best
of
any
beer
i
have
head
to
date
and
it
really
tastes
great
this
beer
is
great
and
when
i
have
friends
from
my
home
area
ct
come
visit
i
will
make
sure
they
have
a
omb
copper
of
there
own
to
try
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
a
nice
american
representation
of
the
style
which
i
have
fond
memories
of
when
i
visited
düsseldorf
definitely
one
to
grab
again
obest
copper
ale
i
have
had
its
such
a
bland
style
this
one
was
very
memorable
and
im
happy
i
got
to
try
it
several
times
at
acbf
copper
pairs
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
including
traditional
german
foods
such
as
bratwurst
pork
roast
turkey
lamb
and
steak
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
surprise
and
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
one
again
true
to
its
name
in
color
clear
with
a
fair
off
white
collection
of
ringside
bubbles
on
top
lacing
is
decent
as
well
somewhat
if
a
scattered
marbled
look
the
taste
is
a
funky
skunk
malt
with
a
bit
of
spicy
herbal
hop
bitterness
theres
a
fermented
fruit
suggestion
in
there
but
overall
its
just
a
good
old
german
brew
with
a
little
bite
that
goes
down
easy
but
not
entirely
quietly
the
feel
is
of
a
subtle
but
certain
brisk
tang
for
the
tip
of
you
tongue
on
a
medium
light
bodied
brew
very
nice
and
an
understandable
flagship
o
i
figured
i
would
like
this
but
i
had
no
idea
id
like
it
as
much
as
i
did
awesome
stuff
overall
just
a
great
enjoyable
beer
right
here
i
didnt
know
it
would
be
a
german
style
and
flavor
before
opening
it
i
was
expecting
just
a
regular
american
amber
pleasantly
surprised
will
gladly
return
to
this
this
is
quite
a
crisp
brew
it
is
light
without
being
watery
but
also
modestly
carbonated
to
help
glide
the
flavors
across
the
tongue
admittedly
this
isnt
a
style
i
typically
geek
out
over
but
this
one
was
decently
done
i
appreciate
the
chance
to
give
it
a
try
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
im
not
sure
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
super
well
done
for
the
style
and
very
drinkable
a
welcome
sight
in
an
airport
but
there
are
other
beers
that
i
would
look
for
o
this
beer
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
it
is
also
very
easy
to
drink
had
my
first
try
while
on
a
business
trip
to
north
carolina
and
was
very
pleased
it
has
a
smooth
flavor
that
goes
wonderfully
with
a
nice
rib
eye
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
the
after
taste
on
the
beer
was
as
good
as
the
taste
when
the
beer
hit
your
mouth
comparison
for
me
would
be
boont
amber
ale
or
moose
drool
this
is
currently
in
my
top
3
favorite
beers
and
always
fresh
since
i
only
live
30
minutes
from
the
brewery
lucky
me
a
solid
lager
good
flavor
and
great
balance
great
session
candidate
had
this
beer
in
a
growler
years
ago
and
then
more
recently
on
draft
agree
with
the
over
reviewers
that
this
beer
is
an
underutilized
and
underappreciated
style
german
altbier
it
was
one
of
their
first
beers
and
definitely
a
winner
very
clear
and
an
excellent
example
overall
dang
this
beer
was
certainly
a
very
pleasant
surprise
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
takes
on
a
simple
and
classic
style
and
i
must
say
omb
pretty
much
nailed
it
this
is
very
full
flavored
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
well
done
omb
mecklenburgs
flagship
copper
ale
does
dusseldorf
proud
with
a
very
versitile
beer
with
an
array
of
entrees
or
as
a
rather
satisfying
session
unto
itself
o
nothing
flashy
here
but
a
solid
amber
ale
this
is
a
style
you
dont
see
much
of
and
olde
mecklenburg
has
made
this
their
brewery
standard
well
done
this
is
a
brew
where
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
individual
parts
overall
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
ale

by

finishing
with
a
delightful

of
fresh

appropriately
clean

easy

very
wellcrafted
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
we
picked
up
a
pack
of
bombers
to
bring
home
so
i
hope
its
just
as
satisfying
and
enjoyable
from
the
bottle
o
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
o
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
isnt
that
much
exciting
about
it
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
putting
much
effort
into
seeking
out
my
first
omb
beer
to
try
poured
into
a
becker
a
rich
clear
copper

awesome

the

this
is
one
damn
fine
rendition
of
an
alt
beer
it
packs
alot
of
subtle
delicious
flavorsiam
lookin
forward
to
trying
the
rest
of
the
omb

from
tap
into
a
new
belgium

poured
copper
surprise
surprise
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
bread
and
grain
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
banana
bread
and
grain
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
there
were
quite
a
few
nice
flavors
and
aromas
going
on
in
this
one
but
it
really
didnt
stand
out
over
some
other
brews
ive
had
from
the
same
style
while
this
was
unfortunate
it
wasnt
disappointing
if
this
one
were
a
little
more
complex
it
could
have
been
something
special
but
it
just
feels
as
if
they
held
back
some
hopefully
they
will
go
for
it
in
the
future
and
truly
shock
all
the
craft
beer
drinkers
out
there
in
the
future
overall
not
too
bad
one
of
the
most
drinkable
of
their
brews
but
after
trying
more
at
the
brewery
this
one
seems
a
little
under
flavored
and
simple
very
nice
altbier
interpretation
glorious
with
pretzels
and
mustard
o
overall
this
is
a
terrific
drinking
beer
the
balance
between
maltiness
and
bitterness
is
quite
good
without
a
clash
of
flavors
as
can
often
happen
in
an
american
brown
ale
and
the
cleanliness
of
lagering
a
topfermented
beer
smooths
out
the
character
nicely

thanks
for
the
omb
beer
wil
another
good
one
form
this
brewer
trying
the
olde
mecklenburg
while
on
layover
at
charlotte
nc
airport
at
the
restaurant
taste
of
carolina
the
beer
poured
a
rich
clear
copperamber
with
thin
white
head
that
is
lacing
the
smell
includes
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
a
well
balance
beer
between
caramel
malt
and
hops
which
help
to
clear
the
pallate
after
the
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
medium
body
beer
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
wish
i
could
drink
more
the
beer
had
a
lighter
body
to
it
and
the
beer
was
extremely
drinkable
very
smooth
and
a
wellbalanced
beer
from
what
i
can
tell
this
is
what
a
german
alt
is
supposed
to
taste
like
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
wish
that
i
could
get
in
atlanta
as
if
i
could
it
would
be
a
staple
at
my
house
od
a
great
beer
thats
very
traditional
its
always
nice
to
pick
up
a
few
of
these
when
i
visit
the
qc
very
smooth
drinkable
and
well
balanced
very
good
beer
from
such
a
young
brewery
as
someone
who
enjoys
a
variety
of
beers
year
round
with
my
tastes
being
very
seasonal
i
dont
usually
have
one
beer
that
i
can
really
enjoy
all
the
time
this
is
absolutely
the
exception
to
the
rule
what
an
outstandingly
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
very
proud
to
have
these
guys
as
one
of
our
many
local
breweries
great
beer
great
people
o
old
mecklenburg
makes
yet
another
tasty
low
gravity
beer
not
complex
by
any
means
but
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
warm
summer
evening
o
what
else
can
i
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
always
fresh
always
tasty
and
always
easy
drinking
omb
is
doing
it
right
all
in
all
a
good
local
brewery
with
some
good
beers
however
omb
copper
is
not
anything
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
if
you
happen
to
be
in
the
charlotte
nc
it
is
worth
a
tasting
but
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
bother
the
benefits
of
being
local
are
abundant
but
if
truth
be
told
this
is
not
the
best
beer
in
charlotte
its
everywhere
to
be
sure
and
its
got
some
decent
characteristics
most
prominently
its
drinkable
but
then
again
all
4
8
beers
are
more
or
less
drinkable
the
appearance
is
copper
to
be
sure
the
smell
missed
it
the
taste
was
good
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
like
most
altbiers
overall
if
this
werent
a
local
beer
with
a
great
presence
in
the
queen
city
it
would
an
afterthought
not
sure
that
they
can
expand
outside
of
charlotte
definitely
a
beer
i
will
be
having
again
a
great
beer
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
after
a
hard
day
out
in
the
blazing
sun
very
refreshing
and
overall
a
great
tasting
beer
overall
i
would
summarize
the
omb
copper
as
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
it
is
highly
drinkable
on
its
own
or
paired
with
a
variety
of
foods
congratulations
to
the
brewers
keep
up
the
good
work
o
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
absolute
awesomeness
best
beer
in
the
world
i
love
omb
copper
live
near
theer
and
get
like
3
growls
a
week
and
i
think
it
is
just
the
best
stuff
ever
go
out
and
try
some
i
will
even
buy
you
some
it
is
a
copper
color
with
white
head
and
smells
real
malty
with
noble
hops
and
some
malt
tastes
and
sweets
it
is
awesome
the
copper
pours
a
nut
brown
color
with
a
stiff
head
that
sticks
to
your
glass
presents
caramel
biscuits
with
underlying
notes
of
datesraisins
authentic
is
the
first
word
that
comes
to
mind
stellar
is
another
if
you
are
even
remotely
close
to
charlotte
n
c
make
a
trip
and
get
a
growler
or
two
kudos
to
the
brewers
for
hit
ting
the
bullseye
on
this
one
easy
drinker
for
the
style
though
a
little
heavy
the
appearance
is
a
perfect
crisp
clear
copper
smell
is
of
toasty
munich
and
bready
biscuity
pilsner
malts
the
taste
is
again
a
perfect
balance
of
crisp
cleanliness
toasty
malts
mellowing
into
a
mild
caramel
treacly
sweetness
with
a
perfect
balance
of
noble
german
hops
extremely
well
done
drinkability
smooth
refreshing
and
just
a
pleasant
drink
overall
its
nice
to
see
a
brewery
specializing
and
giving
great
care
to
these
german
styles
if
you
live
in
the
charlotte
area
you
have
to
try
copper
from
olde
mecklenburg
brewery
d
its
easy
to
drink
despite
its
pitfalls
the
atmosphere
of
their
taproom
is
good
and
it
is
easy
to
stick
around
and
kill
these
beers
nit
a
bad
session
beer
if
you
can
get
over
the
metallic
taste
d
i
could
put
this
back
all
day
it
is
so
easy
to
go
through
a
whole
growler
of
this
while
watching
a
football
game
if
you
love
a
good
lager
then
this
is
for
you
i
know
i
will
pick
this
up
again
and
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
from
omb
it
is
their
flagship
and
i
truly
believe
it
is
their
best
offering
it
pours
a
good
strong
copper
color
with
a
yellowish
white
head
it
has
a
great
scent
of
floral
hops
and
hints
of
caramel
it
has
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
great
smooth
body
very
drinkable
a
really
decent
beer
all
and
all
a
great
beer
that
is
well
worth
a
try
on
a
side
note
i
did
pick
up
a
growler
of
this
beer
while
at
the
brewery
that
i
will
be
reviewing
in
the
next
few
days
d
this
was
good
i
would
like
to
try
it
at
a
true
beer
bar
not
a
hotel
bar
on
tap
at
macs
speed
shop
steele
creek
a
favorite
style
i
had
to
really
work
to
maintain
objectivity
here
beautifully
presented
dark
brown
in
the
glass
with
amber
and
orange
highlights
helped
by
the
setting
sun
coming
through
the
window
behind
it
subtle
carbonation
visible
smell
was
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
first
sip
was
at
first
a
touch
sweet
but
immediately
shifted
to
a
round
biscuity
malt
with
a
rich
hops
bitterness
that
finished
a
touch
dryperfectly
balanced
easily
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
the
moderate
abv
would
render
this
a
session
beer
of
choice
and
something
id
seek
out
wherever
i
could
though
sadly
i
dont
live
in
nc
and
havent
yet
seen
it
here
in
md
drinkability
solid
well
done
dark
lager
where
this
one
lacks
in
flavor
it
at
least
somewhat
makes
up
for
it
in
texture
and
finish
crisp
and
nicely
carbonated
the
copper
serves
almost
as
a
palate
cleanser
with
how
clean
it
finishes
overall
certainly
not
the
most
complex
or
adventurous
beer
but
this
one
is
inoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
making
it
highly
drinkable
although
also
highly
forgettable
a
very
enjoyable
alt
good
stuff
copper
alt
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
subsequent
mecktoberfest
in
my
mind
but
this
brewery
is
also
less
than
a
year
old
this
is
really
fresh
germanstyle
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
good
olde
meck
gets
in
a
few
years
john
is
on
to
something
special
here
recommended
and
watch
this
brewery
anyway
if
you
want
to
know
good
german
beer
try
anything
by
old
meck
close
to
two
finger
head
of
cream
white
very
whipped
up
froth
freshness
extends
the
head
life
unusually

perfect

would
please
even
the
most
demanding
resident
of
düsseldorf
great
job
omb
i
wonder
why
im
a
weekly
visitor
drinkability
is
good
for
an
alt
this
is
a
solid
example
on
the
level
of
well
done
german
examples
full
of
caramelly
and
malty
notes
with
a
solid
profile
cheers
pours
a

with
a
chillhaze
not
much
head
or
lacing
smell
and
taste
of
caramel
up
front
followed
by
bread
and
light
hops
needs
much
more
flavor
mouthfeel
is
decent
nicely
creamy
you
could
drink
a
few
but
wouldnt
want
to
glad
to
have
a
new
brewery
in
charlotte
hope
it
grows
up
and
branches
out
drinkability
pretty
nice
heavier
than
the
abv
would
suggest
though
the
shining
point
on
this
brew
is
the
drinkability
it
goes
down
very
smooth
with
a
very
pleasant
palatability
i
could
certainly
have
a
number
of
these
in
one
sitting
it
would
be
nice
to
have
these
in
bottles
because
they
would
be
great
to
crack
open
at
a
summer
cookout
very
solid
take
on
the
alt
style
and
a
good
first
effort
for
omb
period
fuller
flavors
and
just
the
right
amount
of
crispness
in
the
body
helped
enhance
the
drinkibility
of
this
i
looked
forward
to
more
offerings
from
this
new
to
the
charlotte
area
brewery
d
need
i
say
more
i
go
back
week
after
week
for
growler
refills
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
for
this
new
brewery
but
a
little
too
grainy
from
my
perspective
the
color
is
dark
amber
with
translucent
clarity
and
thick
beige
head
with
fine
bead
and
some
lace
with
good
retention
the
smell
has
a
slight
fruity
yeast
aroma
with
subtle
sweet
malt
scent
and
gentle
hop
note
with
hint
of
fruity
yeast
ester
as
it
warms
with
light
alcohol
the
feel
has
medium
high
carbonation
with
slight
spice
and
light
sweetness
and
gentle
toasted
aspect
with
mostly
dry
bitter
finish
with
mild
alcohol
influence
on
the
palate
the
feel
leads
to
a
mix
of
malt
with
toasted
flavor
and
spicyherbal
hop
with
gentle
malt
backing
and
slightly
bitter
hops
with
a
malt
emphasis
on
toasted
grain
flavor
and
finish
is
spicy
bitter
and
mostly
dry
this
is
a
decent
alt
but
more
emphasis
on
hops
than
is
necessary
for
the
style
could
use
more
malt
to
fit
even
though
it
is
still
very
drinkable
and
yeast
seems
to
be
a
proper
alt
strain
based
on
aroma
and
flavor
decent
winter
brew
nothing
outstanding
but
worthy
choice
for
six
packet
over
winter
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
good
notes
of
toasted
malt
and
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
balanced
well
with
some
good
hops
it
is
a
highly
quaffable
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
3
365
timid
nose
aside
this
is
another
secretly
good
offering
from
evolution
o
i
read
back
through
the
above
and
i
feel
like
im
not
giving
this
brew
enough
credit
its
pretty
darn
good
not
world
class
not
award
winning
but
decent
in
its
own
right
my
first
go
round
with
evolution
brewing
and
ill
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
them
in
my
travels
cheers
iid
take
a
generic
ipa
and
then
toss
in
a
few
spices
presto
you
have
this
beer
brown
in
color
carries
a
large
amount
of
head
on
a
violent
pour
from
the
bottle
so
much
so
that
it
ran
over
the
glass
within
a
minute
or
two
the
white
foam
was
gone
i
couldnt
pick
up
that
much
on
the
aroma
but
the
taste
is
sour
yeah
you
can
sugar
coat
it
and
say
bitter
but
the
lack
of
sweetness
comes
off
as
if
you
are
sucking
on
a
bag
of
buckles
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
good
to
taste
in
a
comparison
of
winter
beers
def
taste
like
a
backyard
brewer
o
decent
beer
not
going
to
see
it
out
again
i
could
compare
this
to
an
ipa
or
to
a
red
ale
positively
enjoyable
with
plenty
of
toast
but
nothing
burnt
the
malt
is
outstanding
and
lasting
throughout
the
drink
the
balance
is
excellent
and
the
hops
hold
their
own
without
becoming
fruity
its
creamy
but
also
strong
and
stately
what
a
treat
as
a
bonus
the
tour
guide
brought
a
growler
of
secret
spot
along
on
the
tour
of
the
brewery
and
refreshed
our
glasses
as
he
talked
o
enjoyable
enough
brew
malty
beer
lovers
will
enjoy
this
one
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
evolution
brewing
has
had
several
very
good
brews
in
their
initial
splash
into
va
see
lot
3
ipa
for
the
best
of
the
bunch
secret
spot
is
also
a
high
quality
brew
that
crosses
style
lines
of
west
coast
style
red
ale
with
supernoble
hopped
altbier
definitely
this
is
a
good
one
to
check
out
oonce
again
the
altbier
is
beyond
me
at
first
i
was
like
ipa
but
then
i
was
like
nahhh
it
certainly
has
the
nose
of
an
ipa
but
the
taste
of
a
muted
ipa
that
is
somewhat
more
dignified
and
stable
it
is
what
it
is
and
its
proud
and
it
wont
change
it
is
worth
a
try
ill
say
its
really
just
an
easy
drinker
much
like
an
apa
o
a
solid
beer
that
i
will
be
picking
up
again
good
beer
for
the
colder
months
clear
honeyamber
pour
topped
with
a
small
bubbly
offwhite
head
minimal
retention
and
a
few
streaks
of
lacing
caramel
malts
in
the
nose
some
floral
and
citrus
hops
taste
of
caramel
malts
toasted
grains
toffee
backbone
quickly
giving
way
to
a
crisp
hoppiness
orange
peel
and
floral
notes
fairly
bitter
from
midpalate
onward
hoppier
than
id
expect
for
an
altbier
maybe
even
closer
to
an
apa
but
still
good
either
way
medium
body
and
pretty
good
overall
o
quite
good
reminds
of
their
esb
almost
with
more
hops
too
bad
it
wont
be
around
until
next
winter
as
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
the
cold
months
d
a
great
draft
beer
worth
sipping
at
the
bar
with
a
nove
salad
and
burger
easy
drinking
and
a
light
hopmalt
finish
id
expect
this
to
become
a
standard
seasonal
offering
from
evo
i
was
told
this
is
a
double
alt
or
a
sticke
altthat
being
saidvery
nice
coppery
color
sweet
caramel
and
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
floral
hoppiness
very
solid
malty
flavors
upfront
definate
hop
presencemore
so
then
any
other
alt
beer
i
have
had
lingering
caramel
presence
great
residual
sweetness
going
on
has
a
nice
bite
in
the
finish
soft
almost
a
creamy
body
goes
down
quite
easy
very
enjoyable
nice
beer
for
the
colder
months
can
at
euclid
hall
pours
red
colored
with
a
one
finger
white
to
off
white
head
aroma
is
floral
with
some
nice
fruits
coming
through
flavor
follows
this
closely
with
a
crisp
hop
finish
it
seems
very
floral
notes
and
some
fruits
galore
going
on
here
light
bodied
and
goes
down
very
easy
not
really
in
the
altbier
traditional
style
but
a
pretty
decent
beer
bordering
on
the
session
ale
side
totally
decent
beer
from
my
former
hometown
of
loveland
one
of
the
first
craft
breweries
there
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
not
bad
not
bad
on
tap
at
tellers
tap
room
for
only
4
25
not
a
bad
happy
hour
price
amber
color
ample
head
aroma
was
sort
of
grainy
malts
and
not
much
else
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
and
almost
made
me
think
of
wet
dog
i
really
didnt
much
care
for
this
beer
and
would
not
order
one
again
overall
decent
alt
toasted
caramel
and
toffee
malts
with
quite
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
have
an
inkling
i
got
a
bad
bottle
absolutely
no
foam
on
the
pour
couldnt
get
a
decent
aroma
for
the
life
of
me
still
mildly
effervescent
on
the
tongue
but
also
a
metallic
aftertaste
that
im
pretty
sure
was
not
intentional
other
than
that
a
bit
grainy
pours
a
deep
translucent
amber
thats
quite
fetching
but
a
bit
of
a
bad
deal
overall
thats
what
i
get
for
buying
sale
beers
c
o
very
nice
offering
here
this
is
typically
not
a
style
of
beer
that
i
enjoy
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
and
remarkably
balanced
the
mild
hop
notes
can
unfortunately
have
a
tendency
to
fade
with
age
on
this
one
the
malt
notes
are
still
there
of
course
but
it
does
come
across
a
bit
sweeter
still
great
offering
here
from
grimm
nicely
done
the
beer
sports
an
excellent
appearance
and
has
above
average
aroma
and
flavors
nothing
overly
unique
but
good
and
flavorful
all
around
a
rather
pleasant
alt
the
malt
kept
tight
to
the
chest
while
the
fruit
and
hops
put
their
heads
down
and
do
their
background
jobs
something
to
sip
on
for
a
while
should
that
occasion
arise
at
least
until
the
heretofore
undetected
alcohol
comes
into
play
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
and
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
caramel
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
prost
pours
a
burnt
amber
with
a
nice
size
fizzy
khaki
head
flavor
and
aroma
both
offer
a
not
overly
sweet
toffee
some
pitted
fruit
and
some
bread
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
was
a
huge
fan
of
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
alt
bier
but
id
personally
grab
an
alaskan
amber
over
this
pretty
nice
beer
overall
i
enjoy
the
way
it
balances
an
interesting
malt
and
hop
profile
without
being
overly
complex
it
makes
for
a
beer
you
can
have
multiple
of
on
tap
upstairs
at
wyknoop
brewery
i
am
shocked
to
hear
this
won
a
gold
at
the
gabf
not
because
its
a
bad
beer
but
because
it
doesnt
stant
out
at
all
as
something
special
to
me
poured
a
clear
redish
caramel
color
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
smells
of
amber
malts
caramel
and
a
bit
of
dried
fruit
flavor
is
a
bit
watered
down
malt
forward
and
bland
i
dont
know
just
not
a
lot
here
to
get
excited
about
its
good
but
is
it
a
gold
medal
worthy
beverage
i
would
have
to
answer
no
but
then
again
im
not
a
professional
beer
judge
hey
where
do
you
sign
up
for
that
anyway
feel
is
fine
medium
to
light
body
mild
carbonation
weird
aftertaste
decent
drink
but
not
a
champion
in
my
book
othis
is
ok
it
is
sorta
what
i
expected
for
a
crisp
lager
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
but
the
offflavor
is
a
little
distracting
not
sure
what
to
think
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
after
tasting
several
alts
of
german
origin
this
one
fit
very
well
with
some
of
the
best
ive
had
from
germany
it
uses
a
touch
of
american
hops
to
it
so
its
drinkable
to
the
hop
heads
on
this
side
of
the
pond
it
was
a
hot
day
and
this
seemed
to
really
go
down
smooth
although
not
a
radical
beer
its
very
drinkable
and
would
be
one
i
would
drink
more
than
one
pint
in
a
sitting
a
decent
altbier
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
a
nice
amber
color
verging
on
a
cherry
red
after
their
porter
this
seemed
bland
and
so
light
dont
know
much
else
to
say
except
i
didnt
write
notes
and
it
tasted
similar
to
an
alaskan
alt
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
or
spend
too
much
but
i
would
for
the
porter
d
pretty
high
though
the
taste
is
a
little
understated
its
pretty
smooth
on
the
palate
and
easy
to
drink
there
were
better
choices
there
though
ishmael
is
a
decent
attempt
at
an
american
twist
on
a
germanstyle
altbier
however
the
earthy
hops
were
rather
overdone
for
my
liking
perhaps
i
need
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
to
see
if
the
hops
contribute
more
than
just
bitterness
o
looked
and
smelled
great
flavor
was
unbalanced
and
not
really
to
my
liking
o
this
makes
for
a
really
drinkable
copper
ale
the
flavors
arent
too
complex
but
theyre
enjoyable
and
the
body
light
enough
to
throw
back
a
few
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
while
walking
to
the
drug
store
to
buy
trash
bags
beer
has
this
bizarre
mineral
taste
i
cant
place
burton
water
salts
heard
that
a
large
portion
of
munich
malt
may
contribute
this
flavor
too
would
prob
taste
better
paired
with
food
on
its
own
a
little
weak
but
not
bad
for
walking
around
the
hood
on
a
mission
bet
itd
be
real
good
in
chili
or
used
to
steam
sausages
a
good
roasted
malt
character
highlights
the
taste
experience
with
a
mellower
but
somewhat
earthy
hop
finish
this
is
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
a
decent
take
on
german
altbier
smooths
out
nicely
with
every
ongoing
sip
nice
balance
between
malt
grains
and
bop
bitterness
nice
light
malt
sweetness
overall
m
medium
light
harshness
on
the
tongue
no
aftertaste
or
finish
overall
a
solid
and
above
average
english
tasting
altbier
i
would
pick
this
up
again
but
there
are
better
in
the
style
ad
from
the
brewery
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
coppery
color
there
was
a
very
small
offwhite
head
on
it
it
has
a
nice
nose
malty
and
nutty
notes
are
most
prevalent
some
earthy
hops
and
a
few
lurking
fruits
the
taste
is
good
a
bit
bitter
with
an
underlying
sweetness
a
good
balance
caramel
malts
nuttiness
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
a
pretty
solid
beer
o
a
nice
simple
american
version
of
an
alt
nothing
crazy
or
out
of
this
world
but
the
amount
of
hops
add
a
nice
dimension
to
the
style
pretty
solid
for
5
99
a
bomber
o
a
pretty
average
brew
here
not
a
horrible
one
but
not
a
great
one
either
overall
very
decent
not
sure
how
many
of
these
id
want
to
have
in
a
row
but
i
enjoyed
the
big
bomber
decent
beer
a
wellbalanced
beer
with
a
dry
malt
start
that
is
accentuated
by
the
white
pepper
hop
flavor
reasonable
body
with
an
equally
neutral
carbonation
the
swallow
has
elements
of
a
brown
ale
with
an
elevated
level
of
hop
poured
only
a
12
head
opaque
naples
yellow
in
color
but
it
had
decent
lifespan
the
body
in
masstone
lookes
like
iced
tea
held
to
the
light
is
more
of
a
raw
sienna
yellow
and
in
either
case
i
wouldnt
really
describe
it
as
copper
it
smells
nicely
of
malt
and
caramel
taste
mirrors
the
smell
and
the
munich
malt
really
comes
through
along
with
a
bitter
hops
reminding
me
a
little

enough
beer
3
5
will
try
to
buy
again
in
the
future
not
my
favorite
style
but
ive
been
so
impressed
with
rising
tide
ill
try
anything
they
put
out
good
but
still
not
my
thing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
opaque
dull
copper
coloring
with
a
thin
white
filmy
coating
along
the
surface
aromas
of
roasted
caramel
and
sugar
sweetness
as
well
as
some
nutty
highlights
flavors
are
light
with
a
caramel
and
toffee
sweet
blend
riding
a
smooth
light
body
roasty
highlights
with
some
subtle
spicing
of
fenugreek
and
nutmeg
the
aftertaste
is
light
and
shortlived
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
and
roasty
notes
smooth
clean
quick
finish
solid
brew
safe
beer
to
lure
people
into
the
world
of
craft
with
o
this
is
good
for
the
style
and
good
for
me
still
quite
drinkable
overall
interesting
take
not
exactly
falling
in
love
here
but
enjoyable
22oz

a

body
with
a
good
sturdy
inch
of
khakicolored
head
smells
malty
with
caramel
chocolate
fruity
nut
malt
dominates
the
flavor
too
nut
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
bread
all
contend
to
be
in
front
medium
to
full
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
awesome
a
really
solid
alt
tasty
and
quaffable
overall
a
solid
offering
from
a
very
good
up
and
coming
brewery
id
peg
this
one
as
a
great
lunch
time
beer
o
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
from
rising
tide
not
my
favourite
one
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
amber
in
color
with
copious
amounts
of
carbonation
bubbling
up
toward
the
surface
throughout
nice
white
head
on
top
maybe
an
inch
and
a
half
before
settling
down
to
coat
the
inside
of
the
glass
for
a
minute
interesting
aroma
mix
of
grains
light
bready
malts
and
a
touch
of
a
grassy
herbal
hoppiness
nothing
crazy
here
but
nicely
balanced
same
could
be
said
for
the
flavor
nice
pale
taste
light
bready
notes
balancing
a
herbal
sort
of
hop
lightly
sweet
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
one
could
go
down
like
water
o
again
kinda
reminded
me
of
the
wellbalanced
approach
brought
by
a
boston
lager
obviously
it
is
a
different
style
of
beer
but
im
just
using
the
boston
as
comparison
since
it
is
an
enjoyable
sessionable
beer
i
wont
get
this
beer
again
because
it
didnt
stand
out
too
much
but
i
did
definitely
enjoyed
it
and
im
glad
i
got
it
overall
this
is
a
fairly
nuanced
yet
accessible
brew
decent
second
bottle
from
rt
that
has
been
overcarbonated
and
a
bitch
to
pour
oh
well
flavors
great
though
lots
of
potential
for
this
new
portland
brewer
this
is
close
to
being
a
malt
bomb
but
dries
out
nicely
on
the
end
the
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
dance
around
i
get
some
wet
new
leather
in
the
back
smoke
nah
cant
be
the
feel
is
lighter
than
it
looks
like
it
would
be
prickly
on
the
end
actually
went
well
with
the
tuna
melt
d
at
this
abv
and
light
flavors
very
drinkable
a
bit
offflavored
kinda
hard
to
describe
its
still
pretty
good
just
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
rising
tide
beers
ive
tried
a
tasty
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
a
nice
session
beer
overall
a
crisp
and
refreshing
take
on
an
alt
fairly
hoppy
for
the
style
but
still
really
drinkable
drink
is
decent
the
slight
salty
minerality
on
the
finish
as
well
as
slight
astringent
flavors
take
away
a
bit
from
the
drinkability
but
with
a
nice
dry
finish
and
smooth
taste
its
almost
sessionable
tastes
like
a
homebrew
very
fresh
and
smooth
with
crystal
and
roasted
malts
through
out
to
finish
not
a
lot
of
body
or
carbonation
leaves
a
dry
roasted
flavor
d
a
surprisingly
good
beer
with
a
lighter
body
than
expected
making
for
easier
drinking
md
extremely
thin
with
no
carbonation
the
taste
is
ok
but
the
body
was
a
huge
let
down
when
i
bought
the
bottle
the
store
had
just
gotten
them
in
the
owner
took
it
out
of
the
case
and
sold
me
the
first
bottle
so
it
wasnt
sitting
long
hopefully
i
will
get
to
give
this
one
another
shot
maybe
its
my
mood
but
this
beer
seems
like
it
has
the
right
combination
of
subtile
flavor
and
mild
characteristics
for
times
when
one
wants
a
less
that
robust
flavor
but
still
a
satisfying
beer
experience
d
decent
beer
that
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
brown
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
still
has
some
flavor
i
would
drink
it
again
the
beer
fits
the
style
quite
well
i
enjoyed
it
but
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
again
that
being
said
i
would
like
to
see
what
other
offering
become
available
from
this
brewery
pours
a
khaki
fourfinger
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
very
good
lace
cloudy
amberred
color
with
some
yeast
left
in

lightmedium
carbonation
and

solid

extremely
drinkable
rich
wonderful
taste
fantastic
medium
bodied
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
one
finishes
clean
with
the
flavor
lingering
on
the
palate
just
long
enough
a
nice
solid
offering
from
maines
other
nano
brewery
ill
finish
this
bomber
with
ease
making
it
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
ive
had
d
goes
down
very
easily
mild
kick
not
too
filling
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
its
the
first
altbier
that
i
enjoyed
as
opposed
to
simply
appreciate
that
it
met
the
style
serving
type
22
oz
bomber
drinkability
is
great
no
problems
getting
through
the
bomber
and
the
crisp
bitterness
cleans
the
palate
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
have
problems
drinking
the
entire
22oz
bottle
i
could
even
have
a
second
one
this
is
a
good
initial
offering
from
this
new
brewery
this
was
a
smooth
easydrinking
beer
interesting
choice
for
a
debut
beer
not
particularly
a
lot
of
personality
but
a
really
nice
mellow
flavor
and
really
a
pretty
tasty
beer
reminds
me
of
a
mild
or
something
will
definitely
keep
an
eye
out
for
other
beers
from
these
guys
goodluck
to
them
and
cheers
d
not
bad
but
perhaps
not
my
cup
of
tea
either
not
sure
if
i
would
have
another
but
it
is
worth
a
try
and
may
try
again
if
offered
according
to
rtbs
website
and
other
reviewers
here
the
official
launch
is
not
until
october
1st
the
bear
is
likely
now
sold
out
of
the
prerelease
but
we
stumbled
across
a
few
bottles
at
bootleggers
in
topsham
me
not
sure
if
there
are
any
left
but
if
your
curiosity
gets
the
better
of
you
and
it
should
call
bootleggers
or
rsvp
in
portland
for
availability
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
a
great
beer
from
a
new
brewery
ill
keep
my
eyes
open
for
more
of
their
stuff
could
have
another
mbc
on
our
hands
as
for
availability
the
bartender
informed
us
that
regular
distribution
of
ishmael
begins
october
1
so
keep
an
eye
out
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
an
average
one
enjoyed
at
the
hotel
soon
after
arriving
in
zermatt
switzerland
lacks
the
soul
of
the
famous
dusseldorf
pub
alts
still
a
nice
reprieve
from
euro
lagers
bright
copper
nice
and
bready
with
a
mild
herbal
hop
flavor
clean
and
lagerlike
too
filtered
and
refined
needs
more
edge
then
again
who
cares
what
one
is
drinking
when
in
the
shadow
of
the
matterhorn
body
depth
about
right
not
rich
or
deep
but
enough
to
carry
the
flavours
and
alcohol
content
without
any
problems
great
beer
overall
nice
beer
for
dinner
this
is
the
bier
that
deutschland
uses
as
a
measure
for
all
altbier
so
i
do
to
having
lived
in
the
country
for
some
years
so
as
my
standard
for
altbier
it
is
a
perfect
blend
of
lagering
and
hops
it
presents
a
pretty
opaque
color
for
deutschland
and
has
a
nice
but
mild
hop
aftertaste
overall
i
thought
this
was
really
great
either
im
just
romanticizing
the
style
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
that
im
having
one
while
in
germany
but
it
has
a
great
taste
mouthfeel
and
finish
d
very
smooth
well
worth
the
drink
if
you
can
find
it
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
not
bad
nothing
special
either
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
light
tan
head
that
shortly
fades
to
almost
nothing
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
dark
amber
with
light
red
highlights
aroma
is
malt
roast
and
a
bit
of
metal
flavor
is
quite
mild
malt
roast
dark
bread
dough
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
has
about
medium
length
very
easy
drinking
and
a
session
if
you
dont
have
much
better
and
like
a
very
mild
dark
beer
d
overall
not
bad
color
a
great
smell
but
a
dissapointing
taste
beer
is
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
great
head
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
caramel
malty
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
malty
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
it
has
a
thick
body
smooth
and
a
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
alt
beers
and
can
be
found
in
many
places
in

decent

remember
to
let
it
warm
up
before
you
drink
itthe
complexity
doesnt
really
come
out
if
you
have
it
cold
d
i
like
this
one
a
lot
but
not
in
any
moment
i
seem
to
have
a
preference
for
this
beer
at
dinner
time
i
cant
compare
this
to
many
other
alts
as
it
is
a
style
that
i
have
only
had
a
few
but
from
what
i
see
it
is
a
pleasant
light
and
refreshing
style
note
a
lot
of
the
finer
characteristics
of
the
smell
and
taste
really
come
out
well
when
this
beer
warms
up
a
bit
d
too
heavy
and
thick
otherwise
alright
taste
is
clean
the
malt
is
a
bit
strawlike
and
combines
nicely
with
the
roasted
chocolate
malt
there
is
an
earthy
taste
to
this
beer
a
bit
of
husk
which
makes
the
beer
a
bit
dry
and
astringent
aftertaste
is
dry
and
light
roasted
md
in
a
sense
this
is
a
wellbalanced
altbier
that
benefits
from
the
hops
and
fruitiness
as
much
as
from
the
woodageing
process
theres
no
wow
factor
to
the
drink
but
just
like
a
good
honest
english
bitter
i
just
cant
resist
another
sip
of
it
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
its
pretty
complex
for
as
little
abv
contained
taste
the
most
important
part
of
any
beer
was
quite
good
quite
malty
and
toasty
with
excellent
balance
some
herb
notes
in
a
way
reminding
of
a
good
cabernet
sauvignon
with
slight
tobacco
undertones
finishes
with
a
dry
bitterness
but
not
at
all
overwhelming
medium
body
drinkability
good
beer
in
the
style
not
very
common
alt
bier
d
sold
altbier
nice
nutty
roasted
notes
combined
with
a
full
mouthfeel
and
balance
gives
it
excellent
drinkability
all
in
all
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
reasonably
priced
and
fairly
easy
to
get
so
if
the
mood
strikes
me
for
this
style
beer
again
i
would
consider
this
one
very
pleasant
pours
a
clear
deep
copper
hue
under
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
to
film
and
collar
leaving
only
a
couple
of
lace
strings
behind
the
nose
is
mild
with
just
a
hint
of
grain
the
mouth
is
light
and
very
prickly
the
taste
is
mild
at
first
with
just
a
bit
of
dark
bread
and
no
caramel
then
the
hops
kick
in
crisp
and
spicey
leaving
a
nice
dry
bitterness
in
the
mouth
espresso
notes
linger
well
into
the
aftertaste
begging
for
another
sip
to
relieve
the
parched
palate
this
is
not
a
great
or
exciting
beer
but
it
is
contagious
must
have
another
tall
palecream
colored
head
holds
strong
after
several
minutes
it
left
a
few
specs
of
lace
as
it
morphed
into
a
scattered
film
not
much
in
the
aroma
just
some
mustygrainy
malt
not
much
flavor
just
a
slight
pale
malt
sweetness
nothing
from
the
darker
malts
and
hardly
any
hops
it
tastes
more
like
a
pils
i
really
like
altbiers
and
i
know
there
arent
a
whole
lot
out
there
but
you
can
do
better
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
like
my
alts
to
have
a
bit
more
of
a
balanced
malty
approach
poured
with
good
head
a
nice
colour
like
a
burnt
amber
mahogony
highlights
awesome
chalky
mineraly
nose
some
ambercaramalyzed
malt
comes
through
first
heavy
in
the
mouth
but
a
somewhat
dry
finish
leaves
it
more
lightmedium
bodied
fairly
malty
overall
but
not
over
the
top
more
restrained
than
say
a
bock
but
certainly
a
lovely
bold
touch
of
malt
falls
apart
a
little
too
quickly
than
id
like
leaves
an
odd
mineral
feel
in
the
mouthfeel
but
void
in
the
taste
plenty
more
caramel
as
it
warms
some
brown
malt
maybe
this
was
nice
but
seemed
to
me
it
could
be
something
more
dark
and
misterious
it
pours
out
of
the
bottle
to
form
a
modest
cappuccino
crown
over
a
darkruby
liquid
aroma
is
toffeish
with

english

not
one
of
the
seven
wonders

poured
a
rich
amberbrown
ale
with
a
white
head
that
started
about
an
inch
or
so
thick
and
subsided
to
a
14
inch
and
left
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
malts
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
flavor
is
very
dry
and
begins
with
a
rush
of
carbonic
bite
and
a
dry
toasted
malt
that
reminds
me
of
black
tea
there
is
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
bitterness
and
it
is
sort
of
floral
but
it
seems
not
present
enough
for
me
to
be
able
to
describe
it
well
the
bitterness
lingers
into
the
finish
and
lends
a
further
crispness
to
this
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
the
carbonic
bite
is
a
bit
out
of
balance
and
takes
away
from
the
maltiness
this
is
a
great
and
flavorful
session
beer
though
my
favorite
in
the
style
is
still
zum
ueridge
opinion
i
really
love
alt
beers
since
i
lived
in
dusseldorf
for
a
while
they
taste
like
home
this
one
wasnt
my
favorite
while
i
was
over
there
but
since
i
havent
had
it
in
quite
some
time
it
tastes
mighty
good
now
i
know
this
is
because
i
miss
the
flavor
and
no
other
style
is
nearly
this
drinkable
with
this
much
flavor
if
you
have
never
tried
an
altbier
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
because
it
is
an
experience
if
you
are
in
dusseldorf
stick
to
the
altstadt
beautiful
brown
color
with
great
clarity
malts
dominate
and
slight
raisin
and
nut
taste
in
my
3
years
in
germany
this
was
my
old
standby
and
got
me
through
many
cold
nights
my
british
freinds
liked
it
a
lot
since
i
lived
in
rheiland
pfalz
this
was
my
stable
when
i
ran
out
out
biers
from
my
filed
trips
up
to
dusseldorf
or
bavaria
drank
hundreds
was
always
very
consistent
slightly
better
on
draft
prost
a
damn
solid
beer
from
a
hard
to
find
catagory
taste
is
very
strong
maltaromatic
and
like
smell
tasting
as
greenmalt
good
and
not
overdone
sweetness
and
a
low
dosed
bitterness
and
phenolic
mouthfeel
is
ok
with
good
carbonation
annd
a
nice
a
full
beer
without
edges
easy
drinkable
and
imo
one
of
the
better
altbeers
though
no
competition
to
uerige
or
gleumes
overall
impression
my
first
alt
beer
so
i
really
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
its
pretty
good
rich
taste
nice
appearance
and
a
clean
finish
the
rich
taste
makes
me
think
it
would
be
a
hard
session
im
happy
after
one
but
glad
i
tried
the
style
drinkability

this
went
very
well
with
my
weisswurst
and
sauerkraut
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
again
preferably
freshly
poured
in
a
german
tavern
i
am
a
fan
of
this
style
but
there
was
something
about
the
bottle
taste
that
i
couldnt
adjust
to
i
have
also
had
it
now
in
a
minikeg
which
i
purchased
from
the
same
store
and
it
tasted
fine
so
im
going
to
have
to
blame
the
bottles
here
if
you
come
across
it
try
it
its
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
just
be
cautious
of
the
bottles
nice
head
forms
upon
pouring
and
takes
quite
awhile
to
subside
aroma
is
a
little
stale
and
perhaps
metallic
flavor
is
slightly
metallic
with
a
nice
malt
and
hop
balance
and
a
toasted
finish
that
lasts
and
lasts
the
malt
and
hop
balance
is
really
nice
and
impressive
and
the
bitterness
is
well
done
the
drinkability
is
very
good
with
the
only
real
flaw
being
that
metallic
aroma
and
flavor
at
the
beginning
a
light
brown
version
of
altbier
that
pour
with
a
burst
of
foam
that
settles
to
a
thin
collar
starts
with
mostly
caramel
malt
flavors
the
hops
become
more
noticeable
later
on
and
ending
with
a
dry
finish
theres
some
bits
of
toffee
and
some
buttery
notes
but
not
much
complexity
fairly
lightbodied
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
a
very
quaffable
altbier
a
beer
that
i
believe
would
appeal
to
many
beer
drinkers
looking
to
try
a
german
beer
other
than
a
spaten
or
paulaner
something
a
wee
bit
more
interesting
color
ís
almost
that
of
pine
bark
and
head
is
off
white
and
short
lived
scent
is
powerful
and
quickly
brings
a
resemblance
to
molasses
to
mind
flavor
can
best
be
sumed
up
into
rye
bread
meets
molasses
meets
brown
sugar
its
a
flavorful
beer
the
flavors
however
seem
out
of
place
its
interesting
at
first
but
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
beers
individuality
had
gotten
on
my
nerves
and
i
was
already
looking
for
something
different
as
i
have
had
very
little
experience
with
alt
beers
this
may
be
typical
for
the
style
german
brewers
are
not
known
for
their
wild
and
unique
creations
like
some
american
micros
are
mouthfeel
was
pleasantsilky
full
and
satisfying
this
is
my
first
altbier
and
i
may
end
up
changing
these
ratings
later
if
future
samples
warrant
it
i
enjoyed
this
style
quite
a
bit
and
this
beer
seems
to
be
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
tasted
080403
this
is
a
very
drinkable
altbier
while
its
not
as
tasty
as
an
uerige
sticke
its
still
pretty
good
and
its
certainly
cheaper
this
dark
alt
beer
poured
almost
a
clear
brown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
stayed
around
for
some
time
the
aroma
was
subtle
but
left
a
little
malt
in
the
nose
the
bitterness
jumps
out
and
grabs
the
tongue
but
lets
the
sweetness
creap
back
in
the
beer
finishes
with
a
light
chocolate
taste
the
mouthfeel
borders
on
creamy
and
is
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
is
what
i
am
hoping
the
alt
in
my
keg
that
is
fermenting
now
will
taste
like
pours
a
clear
deep
brownish
amber
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
offwhite
colored
head
that
fades
into
a
nice
lace
nose
is
sweet
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
toffee
smooth
and
quite
slick
mouthfeel
but
is
a
bit
thin
taste
is
sweet
malts
and
molasses
up
front
followed
by
some
bready
notes
and
a
touch
of
a
raisinlike
flavor
finish
is
dry
a
nice
brew
but
nothing
special
thick
and
creamy
offwhite
cloudtop
head
lots
of
lace
crystal
clear
dark
copper
color
with
slight
carbonation
toasty
malt
aroma
with

strong
dark
malt
in
the
taste
as
well
as
rich
earthy
flavors
and
bitter
chocolate
finishes
dry
with
a
definite
smoky
note
it
seems
that
germany
cannot
make
a
bad
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
and
quite
a
clean
taste
even
though
it
lacked
a
lot
of
flavour
i
couldnt
find
to
much
wrong
with
it
probably
a
bit
boring
but
a
nice
session
beer
light
malty
flavour
with
ever
so
slight
bittering
hop
no
flavours
really
stand
out
not
too
interesting
but
enjoyable
enough
to
drink
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
complex
and
tasy
altbier
and
it
made
me
think
that
we
need
more
altbiers
in
the
us
on

at
the
national

in

imported
through

slighly

almost
some
smoeky
qualities
or
was
it
the
bar
i
drinking
it
in
medium
bodied
very
unique
and
interesting
malts
fail
to
leave
much
of
an
impression
they
come
and
go
on
the
palate
like
the
wind
looks
great
though
it
has
a
beautiful
reddish
brown
hue
mouth
feel
is
pleasingly
thick
and
frothy
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
so
far
overall
this
is
just
your
average
to
below
average
flagship
brown
ale
nothing
to
write
home
about
here
but
maybe
if
it
was
thicker
and
a
little
more
roasty
it
would
be
a
little
better
pour
is
a
burgundy
oxblood
color
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
malty
and
non
descript
taste
is
pretty
clean
with
notes
of
chocolate
slight
toffee
and
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
enjoyable
for
an
easy
drinking
brown
overall
not
the
best
brown
ive
had
but
easy
drinking
thin
watery
fairly
generic
not
bad
overall
o
somewhere
between
doppelbock
northern
english
brown
and
brown
ipa
this
is
an
interesting
entry
for
any
of
those
styles
regardless
of
genre
really
an
excellent
very
drinkable
brew
a
great
example
of
an
american
brown
ale
im
a
fan
overall
a
well
brewed
example
of
a
brown
ale
probably
fits
best
as
a
northern
english
brown
well
brewed
but
nothing
too
memorable
o
3
nope
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
its
not
very
good
at
all
nice
take
on
the
style
hop
forward
with
a
strong
toast
character
this
beer
is
a
little
lighter
in
body
than
other
brown
ale
but
there
is
enough
good
taste
and
quality
to
make
this
beer
deserving
of
a
try
i
am
not
so
sure
i
would
refer
to
this
as
a
german
alt
but
judged
as
an
american
brown
ale
it
is
a
good
tasting
brew
that
may
not
be
the
most
complex
on
the
planet
but
still
has
enough
good
flavor
to
recommend
borderline
drainpour
not
terrible
but
definitely
worse
than
okay
strange
thing
is
that
several
elements
of
the
beer
are
actually
pretty
good
not
sure
what
happened
with
this
one
o
very
drinkable
beer
npt
a
super
complex
beer
but
still
enjoyable
and
i
will
definately
be
picking
up
more
of
their

i
do
like
the

it

it

i
would
drink
it
again
probably
not
going

buy
it
again
just
nothing
really
exciting
at
all
about
it
not
a
huge
fan
of
this

nothing

really
a

i
found
quite
pleasant
not

brew
very
drinkable
to
quote
another
missouri
brewery
i
would
buy
again
found
this
brew
while
vacationing
in
missouri
pours
a

from

seemed
to
disappear
at
about
half
gone
smells

tastes
of

also
from
the
malt
as
well
as
a
nuttybready
notes
i
enjoy
brown
ales
and
this
one
i
enjoyed
more
than
some
others
i
tried
overall
an
attempt
at
a
german
altbier
possibly
has
lost
some
character
due
to
oxidation
this
is
still
an
alright
beer
but
can
certainly
use
some
cleaning
up
it
appears
others
have
had
better
luck
with
with
this
company
than
i
o
good
drinker
that
goes
down
easy
this
beer
hit
the
spot
for
some
reason
worth
checking
out
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
bit
spicier
than
others
of
the
style
but
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
which
i
was
able
to
get
on
vacation
as
this
brewerys
products
are
not
sold
in
my
area
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
brown
ale
a
nice
brew
by
mothers
pours
dark
brown
with
a
nice
sized

has
a
nice
carmely
aroma
which
carries
over
into
the
taste
carmel
malt
dominates
the
flavor
of
this
beer
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
which
i
found
quite
pleasant
not
a
super
complex
brew
but
a
reliable
alwaysonhand
beer
i
almost
always
have
a
few
in
the
fridge
overall
not
bad
my
first
mothers
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
having
more
nice
to
see
another
brewery
in
my
old
stomping
grounds
will
be
trying
their
offerings
as
soon
as
im
back
in

an
alright
beer
though
nothing
special
id
like
a
bit
less
bitterness
and
a
creamier
body
lots
of
malty
flavors
ranging
from
biscuity
to
caramel
to
even
some
chocolate
hops
are
mostly
on
the
back
end
with
a
fair

yeast
throws
out
a

and
a
bit

it
is
not
as
rich
as
it
looks

smells

the
body
is
solidly

this
beer
is
a
little
beguiling
odd
little
critter
i
like
it
well
enough
and
always
glad
to
try
a
small
new
brewery
could
use
a
few
improvements
mainly
some
richness
and
sweetness
would
be
nice
but
overall
im
pretty
happy
with
a
sixpack
purchase
medium

firm
and
dry
im
not
a

even
with
obvious
style
difference
id
buy
it
again
when
i
crave
a
malty
treat
not
a
bad
beer
easily
drinkable
it
just
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
somewhat
one
dimensional
and
boring
and
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
particular
category
so
it
feels
like
theres
no
reason
to
revisit
thanks
to
jeff
for
sharing
this
one
though
bottle
from
champagnes
hits
the
spot
better
than
i
thought
malty
aroma
a
good
balance
of
malt
complexity
not
too
sweet
very
good
drinkability
a
tad
above
average
mouthfeel
smooth
tan
coloured
body
and
a
bit
of
tan
coloured
head
a
transition
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
fine
half
inch
frothy
head
and
great
lacing
scents
of
sugar
cookies
grass
balsamic
vinegar
and
molasses
definitely
an
odd
scent
profile
taste
has
notes
of
soy
malt
and
a
touch
of
molasses
very
different
taste
from
the
nose
not
really
much
there
mouthfeel
is
very
light
some
fine
carbonation
but
overall
an
incredibly
easy
drinking
beer
almost
too
easy
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
felt
this
was
really
lacking
substance
o
very
drinkable
but
a
bit
of
an
odd
beer
flavoraroma
wise
not
really
sure
what
to
think
about
this
might
have
to
try
it
again
with
a
few
other
examples
of
the
style
to
see
how
it
compares
side
by
side
tasting
my
second
beer
from
cheboygan
brewering
over
fathers
day
weekend
in
michigan
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
smell
includes
milk
chocolate
and
roast
the
taste
has
what
the
smell
provides
a
very
solid
beer
but
not
my
favorite
amber
to
me
this
is
closer
to
a
brown
ale
than
amber
nonetheless
worth
parttaking
in
for
sure
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
great
altbier
this
beer
was
all
about
the
malts
and
they
were
very
well
put
together
and
that
made
for
one
tasty
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
has
great
drinkability
its
real
smooth
not
filling
and
the
taste
really
grabs
my
attention
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
perfectly
satisfied
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
pretty
much
everything
but
i
think
the
flavors
were
my
favorite
aspect
i
really
liked
the
combination
of
toasted
bread
and
caramel
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
absence
of
hops
a
little
more
hop
flavor
might
make
this
the
best
altbier
ever
i
also
didnt
like
the
fact
that
it
had
not
bottling
date
all
new
brewerys
should
date
their
bottles
it
just
makes
sense
i
will
for
sure
be
buying
more
of
this
beer
its
too
good
not
to
and
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
its
that
good
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
brewery
they
sure
made
a
very
good
first
impression
on
me
for
a
beer
and
brewery
that
i
have
heard
nothing
about
this
was
a
great
surprise
and
i
am
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
this
brew
this
has
to
be
the
best
altbier
i
have
ever
had
i
dont
think
they
get
much
better
then
this
awesome
job
on
this
beer
guys
rest
i
assured
i
will
be
more
then
willing
to
check
out
more
of
your
brews
this
is
quite
the
sleeper
beer
people
need
to
know
how
awesome
this
beer
is
you
can
bet
i
will
spreading
the
word
o
this
was
a
very
solid
offering
up
at
the
millersburg
bar
in
the
ne
michigan
i
walked
in
expecting
to
order
pbr
and
ended
up
drinking
three
of
these
very
well
done
taste
very
malty
smooth
slightly
slick
medium
bodied
light
brown
sugar
hint
of
coffee
herbal
hop
bread
crust
modest
hop
bitterness
faint
fruitiness
yeast
dried
grass
walnut
skin
semidry
finish
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
once
more
the
crack
revealed
a
brimful
craft
can
and
i
feel
as
though
i
have
gained
something
extra
in
the
bargain
the
inverted
glug
revealed
a
darker
beer
than
i
had
been
expecting
dummy
me
and
this
produced
a
very
noticeable
pseudocascade
which
settled
into
three
fingers
of
dense
puffy
lighttan
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
brown
dark
brown
srm

im
a
big
altbier
fan
and
now
i
have
another
choice
made
better
in
that
its
a
local
brewery
as
local
as
we
can
get
here
in
tx
one
more
plus
is
that
it
comes
in
cans
very
nice
job
hops
and
malt
o
altbiers
dont
seem
to
be
a
very
popular
or
trendy
style
most
that
i
have
had
have
been
drinkable
but
not
too
exciting
this
is
absolutely
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
overall
never
had
an
alt
before
but
this
was
quite
tasty
i
really
liked
hgs
zoe
and
wanted
to
give
this
a
shot
so
far
i
like
what
they
are
doing
there
in
austin
i
would
be
more
than
happy
breaking
this
out
during
any
get
together
this
is
a
tasty
beer
overall
and
its
the
type
of
beer
that
most
everyone
will
like
who
tries
it
it
already
has
one
major
award
under
its
belt
and
will
likely
win
more
in
due
time
its
a
nice
beer
in
most
every
way
and
i
recommend
a
tasting
if
you
can
find
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
brown
color
with
a
solid
off
white
head
i
detected
a
nutty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
a
caramel
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
tobacco
some
earthy
hop
flavor
up
front
followed
by
a
malty
sweetness
slightly
roasty
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
its
light
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
slightly
dry
finish
solid
beer
all
around
for
6
99
a
sixpack
i
would
go
back
to
this
one
regularly
od
a
good
albeit
a
bit
heavy
altbier
abv
is
manageable
and
a
bit
filling
a
good
fall
beer
i
would
reckon
appearance
is
typical
brown
aleish
smells
a
lot
like
a
mix
of
shiner
bock
and
a
brown
taste
just
does
not
hit
altbier
on
the
head
enough
im
not
too
stuck
on
style
but
when
you
say
this
is
an
altbier

pretty
uneventful
in
general
onot
bad
pinic
beer
could
see
myself
knocking
some
down
after
mowing
the
lawn
delicious
got
me
into
the
alt
style
toasty
will
always
order
it
if
its
on
tap
or
in
a
can
im
pretty
sure
this
won
a
medal
this
year
at
gabf
but
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
its
basically
an
american
amber
ale
with
a
moderate
german
character
to
its
grain
bill
really
nothing
too
unique
or
distinctive
about
it
save
that
its
a
little
dryer
than
most
and
still
has
that
nice
rich
body
nothing
bad
about
it
at
all
though
in
fact
its
a
relatively
solid
example
of
the
style
which
i
suppose
is
what
these
beers
are
judged
on
at
such
events
so
maybe
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
i
guess
i
just
figure
that
a
beer
that
can
win
a
medal
out
of
so
many
entries
must
be
absolutely
delicious
and
while
this
is
decent
its
not
medal
worthy
to
me
it
lacks
depth
and
its
carbonation
is
a
bit
light
for
me
so
the
beer
gets
tired
as
it
drinks
im
sure
its
nice
from
the
can
though
and
we
dont
have
many
alts
in
cans
around
so
thats
a
nice
touch
too
my
first
beer
from
these
guys
the
taste
has
a
mild
hop
flavor
up
front
wiht
light
spice
from
the
yeast
and
nutty
toasted
grain
flavor
in
the
malt
profile
with
woody
accent
and
mild
yeast
creaminess
in
the
taste
which
is
supported
by
the
caramel
sweetness
in
the
background
with
toasted
flavor
and
mildly
spicy
yeast
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
decent
alt
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
overall
just
not
enough
to
style
from
the
plethora
of
altbiers
i
enjoyed
so
much
outside
of
duesseldorf
20
years
ago
again
much
more
like
a
nutty
brown
ale
than
a
true
crisp
alt
i
feel
like
fordhams
copper
ale
was
much
more
on
point
balt
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
nice
long
lasting
lacing
head
there
is
a
doughy
bready
aroma
like
dry
bread
the
taste
is
very
dry
and
has
a
very
nice
creamy
roasted
oat
taste
nice
body
and
very
nice
strong
flavors
overall
its
a
nice
dry
thick
roasted
oat
beer
pours
a
dark
rubytinted
brown
with
two
finger
head
and
lace
patches
on
top
of
an
aroma
of
strong
malts
mostly
some
roasted
and
bready
malts
a
graininess
as
well
and
touches
of
sweet
malt
like
caramel
and
toffee
and
i
get
a
touch
of
hops
beer
is
smooth
mediumbodied
there
is
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
to
it
as
i
get
caramel
and
some
other
sugary
goodness
a
little
balance
from
roasted
malts
and
bitter
hops
but
its
not
evenly
matched
finishes
dry
and
is
a
good
sipping
beer
that
i
enjoyed
but
not
really
complex
and
a
little
off
key
overall
as
a
beer
its
pretty
nice
more
like
a
creamy
brown
ale
as
an
altbier
i
dont
think
it
really
gets
there
and
lacking
on
the
carbonation
esp
for
a
canned
beer
but
its
still
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
an
interesting
easydrinking
amber
ale
that
could
sub
in
nicely
for
more
boring
party
beers
like
yuengling
or
blue
moon
this
is
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
this
brewer
i
look
forward
to
more
baltimore
is
definitely
rising
as
far
as
beer
is
concered
i
had
my
can
glass
at
the
ready
and
directly
following
the
crack
i
instituted
an
inverted
glug
this
resulted
in
a
massive
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
lighttan
head
with
great
retention
the
exold
lady
did
not
dig
when
i
would
pour
this
way
but
since
we
are
no
longer
together
i
really
dont
care
what
she
thinks
color
was
more
deepbrown
than
coppery
srm
22

with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
musky
scent
kind
of
an
anise
chocolate
and
caramel
but
heavy
put
some
of
this
in
an
atomizer
spray
it
behind
your
earlobes
and
stand
by
ladies
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
the
tastes
of
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
were
immediate
and
obvious
on
the
tongue
the
finish
gave
it
a
minty
character
that
was
undoubtedly
from
the
hops
this
seemed
bigger
than
its
advertised
5
5
abv
but
that
was
no
problem
for
me
this
was
quite
good
but
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
prost
note
to
dim
youre
right
on
all
counts
o
not
a
style
i
know
well
at
all
looking
back
over
my
reviews
of
the
few
i
have
tried
my
favorites
seem
to
be
bigger
extreme
examples
i
need
to
try
more
traditional
examples
this
is
damn
good
poured
from
a
growler
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
dark
red
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
caramel
dark
roasted
grain
and
slight
berry
tastes
of
slight
grassy
hop
flavor
with
a
nice
fruit
and
dark
roasted
grain
backbone
beer
is
carbonated
well
and
very
drinkable
for
a
medium
body
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
this
tastes
pretty
on
point
for
the
style
and
one
that
ive
rarely
seen
around
a
refreshing
break
from
the
pales
and
ipas
and
a
good
one
to
share
with
a
friend
who
is
more
partial
to
the
malt
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
clean
finish
and
lingering
bitterness
really
fill
this
one
out
overall
it
is
a
very
subtle
and
smooth
very
well
balanced
that
being
said
taste
wise
it
isnt
really
exceptional
if
youre
a
real
fan
of
the
style
id
try
it
but
for
someone
like
me
i
think
10
a
six
pack
is
just
a
bit
too
much
for
this
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
caramel
malts
some
sweetness
very
easy
drinking
considerably
dry
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
worth
checking
out
nice
coppery
color
small
tight
head
nice
aromagood
balance
between
malt
and
a
good
hop
presence
sort
of
metallic
and
soapy
solid

flavor
with
a
nice
bitterness
somewhat
grainy
and
a
tad
earthy
lasting
hop
bite
some
sweetness
in
there
decent
mouthfeel
a
very
nice
beer
in
all
first
offering
i
have
had
from
these
folks
a
tad
pricey
i
am
seeing
more
and
more
10
and
11
dollar
six
packs
and
it
leaves
me
less
likely
to
try
something
new
worth
having
for
sure
though
ever
since
frankenheim
was
pulled
from
the
us
market
i
have
been
searching
for
an
american
craft
alt
that
was
as
authentic
and
drinkable
as
an
original
german
a
tall
order
indeed
and
there
have
been
a
few
come
close
this
one
comes
the
closest
so
far
balt
alt
has
the
same
lighter
body
subtle
carbonation
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
without
being
too
sweet
and
a
slight
hops
bitternessparticularly
in
the
aftertaste
rendering
the
whole
extremely
drinkable
best
of
all
its
fresh
where
i
live
but
comes
in
cans
so
a
glass
pour
can
be
almost
as
good
as
a
tap
very
enjoyable
o
ive
only
tried
a
few
ales
of
this
style
but
this
one
seems
to
be
a
pretty
good
one
not
my
thing
but
an
enjoyable
brew
good
enough
that
i
want
to
try
some
of
unions
others
i
live
5
minutes
from
the
brewery
so
i
think
i
check
em
out
overall
its
alright
but
could
be
better
o
a
nice
tasting
malty
altbier
with
good
flavors
of
breadbiscuit
dark
fruit
and
brown
sugar
somewhat
reminiscent
of
brewers
art
resurrection
though
with
a
bit
more
dark
fruit
and
a
touch
more
bitterness
and
more
of
a
lagery
wheat
feel
quite
drinkable
nice
version
of
a
not
often
seen
style
brewed
right
around
the
corner
from
where
i
grew
up
o
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
the
beer
is
amber
to
copper
with
crimson
highlights
and
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
head
the
aroma
brings
sweet
breads
malt
toffee
ripe
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
pine
and
hop
character
emerge
in
the
flavor
sweet
and
malty
with
nots
of
plum
and
fig
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
good
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
ruby
with
a
retentive
creamy
head
and
light
lacing
robust
rich
aroma
of
roast
malt
caramel
smoke
and
berry
medium
soft
body
light
carbonation
creamy
smooth
texture
rich
malt
flavor
caramel
toffee
and
chocolate
with
light
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
excellent
flavor
and
balance
this
was
a
treat
great
beer
more
of
a
honey
brown
then
an
altbier
they
call
it
a
dark
honey
ale
its
really
good
and
worth
trying
no
matter
this
rating
not
too
sure
how
true
to
form
this
is
for
an
altbier
but
i
do
know
scurry
is
exceptionally

i
feel
sorry
for
the
oats
that
died
to
make
this
liquid
good
dark
color
i
enjoyed
the
mouth
feel
initially
although
it
finished
with
a
very
dry
after
taste
taste
was
initially
okay
expected
more
sweet
from
the
molasses
and
honey
the
after
taste
is
what
got
this
beer
poor
ratings
the
poor
taste
at
the
end
and
the
dry
mouth
feel
taste
is
of
caramel
roasted
malts
light
smoke
honey
and
a
lot
of
molasses
makes
for
an
interesting
and
complex
sessionable
beer
glad
i
picked
it
up
to
try
not
sure
if
i
would
rush
out
to
get
this
again
but
it
is
tasty
doesnt
quite
fit
the
style
for
altbier
but
i
do
imagine
theyre
not
all
that
interested
in
that
im
sorry
to
say
this
falls
far
short
of
the
enticing
description
on
the
bottle
while
the
acuteness
of
the
oats
is
intriguing
this
brew
comes
off
as
thin
and
sugary
without
much
balance
to
speak
of
this
is
my
first
experience
with
off
color
and
i
wouldnt
exactly
describe
it
as
putting
their
best
foot
forward
not
halfbad
personally
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
from
the
malts
but
i
didnt
let
it
ruin
my
night
had
this
poured
from
a
bottle
at
fig
in
downtown
charleston
then
subsequently
returned
the
glass
after
about
3
or
4
sips
and
went
back
to
the
revelry
crosstown
brown
that
i
was
drinking
on
tap
in
the
short
time
that
my
wife
and
i
sampled
the
beer
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
to
get
an
objective
rating
and
experience
the
beer
was
poured
without
so
much
as
a
suggestion
of
a
head
no
froth
foam
or
suds
to
be
seen
it
was
a
deep
roasty
brown
in
dim
bar
lighting
with
decent
clarity
the
aroma
was
somewhat
complex
with
a
sweet
honeylike
aroma
a
little
faint
roasted
nuttiness
and
an
off
sour
vinegar
scent
the
flavor
followed
suit
imitating
a
toasty
american
brown
ale
but
with
the
addition
of
a
peculiar
green
olive
flourish
i
cant
say
if
this
is
the
desired
flavor
profile
or
if
this
bottle
was
spoiled
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
average
adequate
body
and
carbonation
so
it
didnt
really
stand
out
one
way
or
the
other
minus
the
strange
vinegarlike
sour
notes
it
would
have
passed
as
a
mild
brown
ale
but
i
was
simply
unable
to
get
past
that
odd
quality
in
reading
other
reviews
ive
heard
this
beer
described
in
so
many
different
ways
its
a
wonder
that
we
are
all
drinking
the
same
beer
is
it
a
matter
of
bottling
or
production
consistency
or
is
the
beer
that
much
of
an
enigma
as
to
produce
such
vastly
ranging
descriptions
hopped
porter
stout
bubbly
scotch
ale
american
brown
these
are
all
seemingly
contradictory
descriptions
that
youll
find
here
perhaps
i
would
try
this
again
just
to
confirm
whether
the
first
bottle
i
had
was
off
or
not
at
its
best
i
doubt
this
is
going
to
move
the
needle

just
makes
this
i
have
had
it
from

on

and
thought
it
lacked
body
and
was
a
bit
thin

is
perfect
for
this
just
sends
it

dark

good
deal

tad
bit
of

not
very
balanced
watery
as
well
too
flat
for
my
taste
this
beer
was
difficult
to
rate
it
did
not
have
any
head
so
it
was
ugly
it
had
a
slight
sour
smell
which
i
hate
and
the
taste
was
nondescript
pretty
bland
actually
however
it
was
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
it
was
slightly
sweet
and
thats
about
it
i
mean
it
was
a
dark
beer
but
really
did
not
taste
dark
good
dark
beer
for
a
intro
to
non
dark
drinkers
or
those
who
are
scared
of
dark
beers
o
like
most
altbiers
this
seems
like
it
could
identify
in
other
categories
and
this
one
gives
a
clear
impression
of
a
hopped
porter
or
the
beginning
of
an
american
stout
very
flavorful
very
drinkable
an
excellent
beer
o
a
nice
porter
like
beer
nice
roster
major
flavor
smells
great
but
not
of
that
translates
to
the
actual
taste
i
like
the
mouthfeel
for
the
style
good
beer
i
would
drink
again
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
perfect
for
a
make
your
own
6
pack
something
didnt
work
for
me
with
this
beer
way
too
much
carbonation
with
a
head
that
settled
awkwardly
and
uneven
on
top
of
the
beer
with
big
symmetrical
bubbles
it
had
a
soapy
smell
and
bubbly
taste
on
account
of
the
carbonation
it
got
slightly
better
after
it
settled
and
warmed
slightly
the
honey
and
molasses
taste
came
out
a
bit
that
made
me
think
it
tasted
more
like
a
bubbly
scotch
ale
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
but
wouldnt
write
it
off
entirely
as
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
ive
liked
the
other
off
color
beers
ive
tried
low
b
sorta
underwhelming
considering
what
the
listed
ingredients
were
i
thought
it
would
be
a
bit
more
sweet
andor
out
there
was
good
but
let
down
my
high
expectations
pours
a
medium
dark
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
and
plenty
of
lace
aroma
of
malt
sweetness
notes
of
caramel
brown
sugar
the
flavor
has
a
good
amount
of
nuts
caramel
and
raisin
pretty
nice
and
well
rounded
ale
slight
tangy
flavor
to
go
with
the
bread
nuts
caramel
and
raisin
tones
oats
smooth
out
the
body
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
full
bodied
well
carbonated
ale
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
hybrid
style
bier
and
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
some
time
oakey
and
a
bit
malty
with
a
dark
color
and
light
body
flavor
isnt
super
full
but
its
drinkable
i
dont
think
id
drink
it
again
unless
my
only
alternatives
were
cheap
domestics
bottle
from
lazy
dog
macon
pours
dark
brown
with
no
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
floating
to
the
top
it
looks
like
coke
aroma
of
honey
molasses
and
malt
tastes
of
malt
molasses
and
very
sweet
light
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
with
smokey
finish
its
like
drinking
an
alcoholic
cocacola
this
altbier
old
beer
style
brew
pours
a
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
a
very
thin
offwhite
is
seen
more
lacing
seen
than
i
did
expect
after
the
thin
head
very
pleasant
aroma
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
molasses
also
with
more
so
in
the
taste
great
taste
and
goes
down
very
easy
medium
carbonation
as
well
as
medium
bodied
overall
a
different
tasty
brew
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
vanishes
leaving
no
lace
deep
brown
opaque
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium

not
much
of

its

but
cant
say
that
it
wowed
me
over
still
nice
to
try
a
new
style
i
never
heard
of
before
i
loved
this
and
its
my
favorite
so
far
from
this
brewer
the
taste
is
very
good
with
malt
flavor
and
slight
molasses
earthiness
with
sweet
flavor
and
mild
herbal
flavor
of
hops
with
gentle
earthy
and
dry
yeast
with
a
mild
toffeelike
semi
sweet
finish
overall
i
consider
this
pretty
good
for
the
style
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
enjoyable
all
the
way
through
the
body
is
just
short
of
effervescent
and
rests
on
the
border
of
light
and
medium
its
starts
off
with
the
promise
of
a
bigger
body
sweetness
maybe
even
creaminess
but
dries
out
which
is
nice
and
still
keeps
some
smoothness
it
does
go
a
little
thinner
than
the
style
calls
for
but
all
in
all
its
good
stuff
off
color
continues
to
impress
me
so
far
overall
simple
and
unassuming
beer
but
its
well
made
and
balanced
o
no
flaws
but
i
expected
more
given
the
extensive
ingredient
list
only
my
second
time
trying
an
altbier
so
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
another
overall
it
was
okay
wasnt
impressed
it
taste
like
its
going
to
be
amazing
in
the
beginning
and
then
just
falls
off
into
blandness
o
im
glad
i
grabbed
this
in
my
travels
its
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
surprised
by
the
blend
of
raw
grain
and
sweetness
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
honey
probably
plays
a
big
role
in
the
fizzy
carbonation
and
lighter
body
i
enjoy
the
beer
and
find
it
an
interesting
recipe
worth
a
shot
the
flavor
is
less
sweet
than
i
expected
the
hop
is
also
much
more
present
theres
some
strong
porter
elements
to
this
beer
lowly
carbonated
with
a
fuller
body
short
aftertaste
but
with
a
nice
blend
overall
good
beer
though
a
bit
cost
prohibitive
for
me
at
four
clams
per
bottle
were
it
to
be
a
bit
more
reasonable
i
would
readily
make
this
a
standard
addition
to
the
fridge
its
got
an
inviting
maltiness
bolstered
by
the
molasses
and
honey
yet
it
remains
reasonably
dry
and
nimble
on
the
tongue
thanks
to
the
healthy
carbonation
o
altbiers
arent
done
a
whole
lot
but
off
colors
scurry
is
a
very
nice
unique
take
on
this
german
style
keeping
in
line
with
the
malt
and
hop
profile
while
spicing
things
up
with
wheat
and
flaked
oats
for
a
smooth
body
and
honey
and
molasses
for
sweetness
and
a
little
sumthin
special
didnt
expect
the
tart
character
definitely
malt
dominant
with
enough
dryness
at
the
finish
to
counter
the
suggested
sweetness
from
the
aroma
if
that
off
flavor
werent
there
this
would
fare
better
overall
pleasant
and
fits
the
altbier
profile
a
smooth
and
delicate
beer
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
pleasant
enough
though
nothing
to
get
excited
about
either
overall
this
is
only
my
second
altbier
that
i
have
drank
the
other
is
new
glarus
altbier
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
really
good
beer
style
its
like
a
sessionable
brown
ale
flavorful
yet
very
easy
drinking
this
is
honestly
my
favorite
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
off
color
so
far
i
have
had
troublesome
and
apex
predator
its
a
must
try
if
you
like
altbier
i
definately
prefer
off
color
scurry
over
new
glarus
alt
i
would
also
recommend
this
beer
to
people
who
like
a
malty
brown
ale
because
this
beer
will
fit
into
that
niche
very
well
overall
solid
beer
well
balanced
bready
dark
ale
nicely
carbonated
with
some
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
that
adds
a
lot
to
this
beer
i
think
it
is
brewed
very
well
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
seems
like
what
i
have
had
from
offcolor
so
far
is
pretty
great
olove
love
love
off
colors
labels
and
their
general
ambiance
this
is
my
second
beer
from
them
and
both
have
been
above
average
i
never
mind
being
able
to
enjoy
a
well
made
offering
of
a
style
that
is
rare
among
the
american
craft
beer
scene
overall
so
off
color
brewing
defines
this
as
a
beer
that
is
based
on
the
obscure
style
a
kottbusser
which
is
a
dark
honey
ale
i
love
the
vision
and
inspiration
these
guys
have
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
beers
they
have
produced
so
far
if
you
want
something
different
these
are
your
guys
o
enjoyable
brew
esp
when
i
want
something
roasty
but
not
so
much
a
porter
or
stout
overall
a
very
pleasant
summertime
beer
with
a
variety
of
flavors
very
cool
recipe
here
in
a
surprising
beer
a
honey
and
molasses
dark
beer
thats
heavy
on
the
oats
i
expected
a
sugar
bomb
and
got
a
remarkably
dry
and
full
flavored
beer
that
seems
more
appropriate
for
autumn
than
late
spring
dark
amber
to
light
brown
in
color
some
viscosity
here
and
not
a
ton
of
head
creamy
and
lazy
looking
the
nose
is
the
unrefined
sugar
element
of
the
molasses
a
nice
rich
grain
bill
that
ranges
from
medium
crystal
malt
to
chocolate
malt
and
the
buttery
dry
freshness
of
rolled
oats
hops
appear
minimal
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
great
i
get
the
honey
on
the
front
end
the
essence
of
the
bee
the
pollen
and
the
flower
with
much
of
the
sweetness
being
fermented
out
perfect
grain
profile
for
that
flavor
too
its
just
right
more
molasses
in
the
finish
with
a
light
spice
and
a
very
sturdy
base
in
terms
of
body
a
really
dialed
in
and
clever
recipe
i
hope
this
is
around
in
the
fall
when
the
leaves
start
to
turn
it
has
that
hunker
down
and
cozy
in
type
of
vibe
without
being
a
barrel
aged
enormous
beer
i
super
dig
this
overall
as
i
said
im
not
a
great
fan
of
amber
ales
unless
they
are
extremely
welldone
the
caramel
in
scurry
really
is
something
to
experience
and
while
some
of
its
surrounding
flavors
dont
float
my
boat
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
a
very
interesting
concoction
highly
drinkable
and
totally
unusual
im
not
sure
i
want
to
try
this
often
but
its
great
to
share
the
adventurous
spirit
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
seattle
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
few
shades
of
maroon
mixed
in
it
looks
pretty
clear
but
its
hard
to
tell
due
to
the
relatively
dark
color
small
head
beige
its
really
just
a
smattering
of
bubbles
and
even
those
fade
away
after
a
minutes
the
aroma
has
a
grapey
malt
sweetness
to
it
some
deeper
sweetness
molasses
and
caramel
is
also
fairly
strong
maybe
a
touch
of
honey
but
thats
always
hard
to
find
in
beer
fairly
nutty
mild
cocoa
id
bet
the
molasses
contributed
a
good
bit
of
color
because
there
isnt
a
ton
of
darker
malt
flavor
its
definitely
more
toasty
and
lightly
so
at
that
than
roasty
the
taste
is
similar
though
theres
a
piney
hop
note
and
almost
cinnamony
spice
flavor
mild
mint
too
its
fairly
sweet
almost
cloying
for
a
5
abv
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
those
oats
give
it
some
body
its
actually
more
altbierish
than
id
expected
regardless
its
tasty
enough
and
they
packed
in
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
the
abv
but
its
just
not
all
that
enjoyable
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
without
really
committing
to
that
idea
pours
a
clear
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps

of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
molasses
and
nut
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
molasses
oat
and
nut
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
very
nice
set
of
aromas
and
tasty
flavors
that
get
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
i
find
this
beer
to
be
unique
in
that
its
lighter
in
feel
and
abv
but
the
flavor
is
terrific
and
moderately
complex
the
molasses
adds
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
to
go
with
the
honey
and
it
just
compliments
the
cocoa
notes
fantastically
i
could
probably
drink
a
whole
sixer
of
this
wonderful
little
brew
scurry
is
a
somewhat
more
hefty
ale
than
what
the
germans
would
have
made
but
its
kiss
of
molasses
and
chocolate
tilt
suggests
an
american
microbrewer
hand
was
involved
o
this
is
going
to
make
some
great
pancakes
interesting
brew
as
it
holds
about
80
percent
a
solid

mouthfeelbody

i
think
its
a
good
brew
its
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
off
color
brewing
and
hopefully
it
wont
be
the
last
o
i
really
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
brew
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
but
it
is
very
drinkable
o
this
beer
seems
to
have
very
nondescript
aromas
and
flavors
and
doesnt
stand
out
compared
to
any
of
the
other
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
o
really
good
beer
that
surprisingly
comes
in
a
six
pack
love
that
the
aroma
is
on
point
and
the
taste
delivers
as
well
i
would
regularly
drink
this
but
the
price
is
a
tad
steep
however
you
get
what
you
pay
for
cheers
o
good

that
is
well
worth
tasting

a
fizzy

nose
is
mostly
molasses
and
notes
of
coffee
bean
and
roast
taste
is
more
sticky
molasses
and
strong
roasted
malt
notes
some
cooked
brown
sugar
through
a
finish
that
thins
a
bit
medium
body
with
assertive
carbonation
thinning
in
the
finish
overall
a
solid
ale
with
a
really
fun
label
while
i
didnt
get
much
in
the
way
of
honey
or
molasses
the
dark
malty
notes
were
fantastic
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
lagers
but
the
lager
yeast
wasnt
too
prominent
over
the
malts
which
i
really
enjoyed
recommended
to
all
fans
of
malty
lagers
enjoyed
while
several
ounces
of
snow
accumulated
outside
my
door
appearance
is
a
deep
amber
with
white

dry
roasted
malts
with

malty
the
taste
follows
in
suit
with
the
nose
heavy
on
roasted
malts
with
light
honey
notes
shining
throughout
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
light
carbonation
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
style
definitely
worth
trying
o
a
really
well
made
beer
very
enjoyable
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
i
hear
they
will
be
coming
to
ny
soon
cant
wait
decent
beer
nothing
too
special
enjoying
the
sweet
brown
malt
flavours
o
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
a
forgettable
one
still
somewhat
drinkable
o
it
would
be
worth
enjoying
a
6pack

level
another
more
obscure
style
that
i
do
not
have
alot
of
experience
with
but
from
past
examples
this
is
much
sweeter
and
richer
for
the
style
in
my
eyes

very
well
balanced

with
syrupy

on

a

enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
and

to

o
great
beer
for

easy
to
drink
with
low

too
sweet
to
be
sessionable
but
one
goes
down
great
this
is
a
beautifully
restrained
ale
which
reminds
me
of
new
glarus
in
its
drinkability
in
other
words
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
in
a
couple
of
hours
and
i
think
thats
part
of

intention
its
an

crushable
brew
smells
sweet
and
malty
touch
of
honey
clear

with

not

i
love
how
it

but
not
cloying
pleasant
dry

elegant
you
might
say

is
slightly

the

is
greater
than
the

of
its

i
love
it
bonus
this

a

by

of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
dry
barley
mixed
nuts
dried

and
a

the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
things
are
dominated
by
a
toasty
syrupcoated
nut
flavor
that
doesnt
sit
all
that
well
with
my
tastebuds
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
slick
feel
overall
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
of
this
beer
it
was
nice
to
try
a
style
thats
nearly
extinct
but
this
one
just
tasted
a
bit
too
strange
for
me
still
a
solid
way
to
end
a
crazy
night
o
very
nice
altbier
sweet
but
not
sweet
enough
to
inhibit
drinkability
i
probably
had
around
4
or
5
tasters
of
this
throughout
the
night
the
brewers
mentioned
the
next
batch
will
have
more
honey
aroma
in
this
batch
it
was
added
all
at
once
and
sank
to
the

forward
to
this

its

fresh

i
would

rather

for
some
reason
i
am
surprised
that
this
is
so
appealing
more
sweet
and
gentle
than
my
conceptualization
of
the
alt
style
but
a
great
session
brew
with
enough
complexity
to
hold
ones
attention
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
light
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
simple
as
that
the
musk
and
altness
of
it
comes
all
from
the
malts
which
are
heavily
wheated
and
less
to
the
darker
brown
side
of
the
spectrum
if
this
beer
was
put
in
front
of
us
we
wouldnt
turn
it
away
but
we
likely
wont
actively
seek
it
out
again
compare
this
to
the
americanized
version
of
the
alt
with
the
musky
old
ales
and
these
unfortunately
fall
to
fainter
shells
of
those
more
robust
flavorforward
offerings
that
is
us
being
mighty
nitpicky
so
dont
get
us
wrong
this
was
pleasant
and
we
are
always
happy
to
sip
down
an
organic
beverage
enjoyable
and
something
germany
should
be
generally
proud
to
export
taste
is
round
with
malt
a
bit
of
depth
but
no
heaviness
grainy
a
slight
honey
sweetness
and
the
roundness
of
the
malt
come
together
perfectly
with
a
good
little
bite
from
carbonation
this
finishes
dry
and
with
a
slight
bitter
the
herbal
is
but
a
whisper
in
the
drink
just
barely
there
crisp
and
lovely
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
in
general
very
different
the
combination
of
a
different
fruit
sweet
clove
and
maltiness
make
an
excellent
beer
worth
seeking
out
i
bought
this
bottle
for
3
29
at
front
street
market
in
butte
montana
this
beer
is
a
very
reasonably
priced
treat
and
i
must
extend
kudos
to
my
favorite
local
beer
outlet
ive
noticed
a
few
of
these
german
imports
that
are
a
very
good
value
prost
not
really
getting
the
alt
designation
on
the
label
this
is
more
helles
than
alt
even
if
it
did
use
top
fermenting
yeast
not
recommended
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
nice
example
a
typical
german
lager
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
would
expect
from
that
style
and
it
didnt
seem
to
be
all
that
similar
to
any
of
the
altbiers
ive
had
but
ive
never
had
a
munster
alt
before
so
that
might
be
typical
for
the
style
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
the
sweetness
might
start
to
wear
on
me
after
that
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
that
caramel
aspect
made
it
pretty
nice
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
if
it
was
toned
down
a
little
it
would
help
this
beer
out
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
this
style
its
priced
well
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
german
lagers
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
it
was
pretty
similar
to
some
of
the
better
german
lagers
ive
had
and
it
didnt
have
anything
off
about
it
this
made
for
a
nice
first
impression
for
brauerei
pinkus
mueller
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
a
few
more
of
their
beers
nice
job
guys
keep
up
the
good
organic
work
my
first
altbier
pours
murky
dark
yellow
with
a
small
white
quickly
receding
head
aroma
of
sweetly
tart
cherries
some
alcohol
not
much
else
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
with
the
cherry
and
honey
then
fades
into
pilsner
malt
characteristics
light
and
lots
of
carbonation
so
would
be
fine
for
a
hot
day
overall
a
small
step
up
from
a
pale
lager
if
you
ask
me
meh
a
delightful
alt
beer
ive
grown
to
expect
alt
to
appear
darker
but
i
can
totally
take
a
pass
at
this
because
of
its
flavorful
goodness
great
on
a
humid
summer
eve
with
a
nice
cheese
plate
would
probably
be
wonderful
with
grilled
sausages
o
overall
i
like
this
but
i
think
it
is
a
little
too
sour
to
be
a
really
good
alt
there
is
not
enough
malt
flavor
and
aroma
or
bitterness
and
a
little
too
much
fruityeast
ester
going
on
to
make
this
a
quaffable
alt
rjt
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
light
smooth
and
slightly
foamy
mouthfeel
that
actually
complements
the
bodys
weight
quite
well
closes
semidry
with
little
to
no
residual
stickiness
clinging
to
the
mouth
o
a
very
drinkable
bier
my
first
alt
that
want
a
homebrew
and
it
was
much
different
then
i
expected
i
could
easily
drink
a
liter
of
this
on
a
warm
day
and
to
me
thats
a
sign
of
a
good
german
beer
i
think
this
is
my
first
proper
german
alt
pretty
well
enjoyable
a
strange
brew
for
sure
i
almost
thought
it
was
brewed
from
lager
yeast
odd
tangy
notions
that
didnt
blend
well
with
a
ho
hum
base
beer
i
like
the
fact
that
its
organic
but
this
is
a
no
go
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
with
an
odd
combination
of
bready
yeast
grassy
hops
citrus
and
astringent
metal
really
weird
and
off
style
with
a
very
watered
down
mineral
like
flavor
some
zesty
spice
bready
yeast
citrus
peel
and
rusted
tin
bland
and
very
unpleasant
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
nice
hue
decent
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
full
and
floral
flavor
is
of
cardboard
and
fresh
hay
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
high
c
16oz
bottle
pours
super
pale
gold
super
clear
topped
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
holds
decent
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
grassy
biscuity
fresh
grape
juice
apple
juice
tastes
are
crisp
very
dry
tart
white
grape
chardonnay
apple
juice
grassy
delicate
noble
hops
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
bubbly
finishes
dry
overall
this
is
different
than
any
other
altbier
ive
had
definitely
sessionable
but
not
for
the
price
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
what
more
can
you
ask
for
from
a
brewer
this
is
terrific
and
refreshing
brew
nice
job
overall
this
is
a
great
german
alt
if
i
ever
go
back
i
will
have
to
pick
up
the
pils
light
to
medium
body
and
crisp
there
is
a
mild
tartness
about
it
slightly
drying
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
with
a
clean
crisp
feel
which
made
the
beer
extremely
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
worldglass
beer
and
one
that
i
will
enjoy
often
o
a
very
interesting
flavorful
and
drinkable
beer
o
an
interesting
beer
very
earthy
and
raw
i
dont
know
of
the
organic
part
has
anything
to
do
with
that
but
its
definitely
intererting
o
not
bad
at
all
but
i
wouldnt
want
much
of
it
o
a
much
lighter
alt
than
i
am
used
to
refreshing
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
beer
i
enjoyed
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
may
pick
this
up
again
for
a
summer
time
thirst
quenching
session
3
5
pinkus
was
decent
but
i
am
not
really
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
bottle
overall
very
intriguing
brew
i
wish
i
could
figure
out
more
about
the
taste
and
whats
in
it
o
a
pleasant
beer
i
could
see
taking
down
a
handful
of
these
too
sweet
to
be
honest
im
far
from
a
fan
and
i
dont
believe
its
a
particularly
good
alt
its
smooth
and
somewhat
drinkable
but
depressing
in
its
expressibility
top
beer
very
very
drinkable
this
is
a
subdued
beers
in
many
ways
but
subtle
and
tasty
overall
it
is
floral
and
bready
some
more
complexity
would
go
a
long
way
still
i
could
easily
drink
several
pints
of
this
i
may
have
gotten
an
old
beer
ill
certainly
keep
my
out
for
it
in
the
future
and
give
it
another
try
clearly
they
are
doing
something
right
by
the
other
reviews
i
fear
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
of
this
stuff
o
not
at
all
like
any
alt
ive
had
and
just
not
good
to
my
taste
o
decent
alt
ive
had
much
better
would
pass
this
up
if
i
saw
it
again
i
dont
know
i
lived
in
ktown
so
maybe
there
is
a
difference
between
southern
and
northern
alts
but
for
an
alt
i
much
prefer
a
hannen
to
the
pinkus
opinion
unfortunately
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
in
that
i
was
really
hoping
for
an
altbier
this
is
not
that
it
is
a
pretty
decent
german
beer
but
not
even
a
northern
alt
would
work
here
as
it
is
too
light
and
has
too
much
of
some
things
and
not
enough
of
others
it
is
an
ok
session
beer
nonetheless
but
the
fact
that
it
is
grainy
makes
it
a
bit
hard
to
just
sit
and
drink
i
have
one
more
bottle
of
this
beer
that
i
will
drink
pretty
soon
but
i
doubt
that
i
will
be
buying
any
more
of
this
beer
any
time
soon
drinkability
very
smooth
and
drinkable
though
i
dont
think
it
is
true
to
style
it
is
really
tasty
stuff
i
like
this
beer
in
many
ways
and
the
drinkability
is
high
d
this
is
a
delightful
readily
available
altbier
that
delivers
the
goods
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
to
get
to
know
german
beer
looks
more
like
a
pils
than
their
ur
pils
does
this
one
is
a
straw
slightly
hazed
but
no
yeast
sediment
in
the

with

very
nice

of

strains
nothing
like
the
brown
versions
found
in
dusseldorf
this
is
a
pale

totally
different
version
carbonation
is
natural
smooth
light
to
medium
bodied
never
heavylight
perfect
crisp

qualities

on

drinkability
overall
was
killer
a
beer
i
remember
trying
before
i
started
writing
reviews
im
glad
i
decided
to
revisit
these
beers
each
one
is
more
interesting
than
the
next
next
up
the
dunkel
at
first
i
wasnt
too
keen
on
this
stuff
probably
because
i
was
expecting
a
typical
alt
but
then
i
realized
how
unique
and
drinkable
it
is
unlike
any
other
german
ale
ive
sampled
poured
from
bottle
into
pilsner
glass
liquid
is
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
small
white
fizzy
cap
that
quickly
settles
smell
is
incredibly
bready
lots
of
raw
dough
and
crust
some
yeast
and
malted
wheat
in
the
smell
as
well
taste
seems
off
it
is
equally
tart
and
sour
as
it
is
malty
i
cant
remember
having
an
altbier
that
was
this
tart
not
to
mention
this
lacking
in
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
body
with
a
medium
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
too
good
because
of
the
off
flavors
overall
this
beers
flavors
are
a
bit
harsh
and
unbalanced
pinkus
meet
drain
a
nice
session
beer
that
agreed
well
with
some
salty
pretzels
d
the
lightbodied
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
go
down
rather
easily
drinkability
really
refreshing
beverage
knocked
down
a
bit
due
to
the
price
my
first
altbier
and
i
am
not
disappointed
drinkability
smooth
light
and
tasty
one
could
drink
all
night
and

500ml

straw
colored
with
some
haziness
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
long
on
this
one
receding
in
minutes
to
a
thin
film
smells
very
fruity
but
its
hard
to
place
persimmon
maybe
a
bit
of
tartness
citrus
zest
light
bready
malt
and
a
bit
of
aspirin
similar
on
the
palate
ambiguously
fruity
with
a
touch
of
lemony
tartness
and
orange
peel
fairly
sweet
and
lacking
the
bitter
finish
id
expect
from
an
alt
or
any
finish
to
speak
of
actually
it
just
falls
off
the
palate
finishes
with
an
aspirinlike
flavor
that
puts
me
off
the
body
is
thin
and
carbonation
a
bit
too
low
pretty
mediocre
though
it
goes
down
easily
enough
on
a
hot
day
this
would
be
a
fantastically
thirst
quenching
beer
i
think
i
could
knock
a
few
of
these
back
in
quick
succession
the
organic
aspect
is
a
big
plus
in
my
opinion
d
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
with
this
one
i
expected
something
much
darker
and
rougher
but
was
given
a
sweet
surprise
this
beer
is
much
more
simple
than
i
was
expecting
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
kolsch
nice
cloudy
strawgolden
colored
pour
with
white
head
nose
has
bright
fresh
fruits
with
a
whiff
of
sees
hard
candies
on
the
palate
the
fruit
is
there
as
well
but
also
a
pleasant
malty
component
that
isnt
overly
sweet
rather
light
bodied
but
smooth
texture
of
course
with
nice
carbonation
good
drinkability
taste
is
sharp
got
that
signature
german
lager
flavor
thats
very
crisp
and
refreshing
its
got
a
nice
light
noble
hop
bite
but
theres
also
some
creamy
maltiness
to
it
its
super
drinkable
especially
when
its
90
degrees
out
drinkability
to
me
this
beer
is
a
little
too
sweet
not
really
to
style
imbalanced
and
generally
flawed
it
is
pretty
refreshing
though
and
i
dig
the
texture
quite
a
lot
split
the
difference
notes
to
some
this
beer
up
quickly
i
would
call
it
simply
liquid
bread
and
a
tasty
one
at
that
the
pour
initially
netted
a
massive
two
fingers
worth
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
that
settled
into
a
marshmallow
fluflike
consistency
color
was
a
beautiful
strawyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
light
slightly
sweet
but
quite
tempting
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
very
dry
quality
on
the
tongue
finish
was
totally
bonedry
man
this
would
be
fantastic
in
the
summer
a
beer
with
slightly
more
than
a
golden
look
sort
of
mild
white
head
a
nose
of
apple
and
a
hint
of
sourness
very
very
discreet
palate
of
hay
and
apple
doughiness
but
also
a
very
mild
sour
finish
no
smokey
qualities
though
and
the
malt
is
a
bit
lean
the
carbonation
is
good
on
the
tongue
and
a
good
late
summer
early
autumn
feel
very
drinkable
as
a
general
beverage
this
falls
somewhere
between
good
and
excellent
as
an
alt
i
cant
see
how
id
even
rate
it
as
average
i
shall
have
to
do
more
research
on
this
beer
nicelight
tart
and
refreshing
maybe
not
a
typical
altbier
but
tasty
nonetheless
ill
be
living
near
munster
soon
so
looks
like
ill
have
lots
more
in
my
future
cheers
d
pinkus
has
brought
a
smorgasboard
of
german
beer
styles
together
and
created
a
fantastic
ale
this
would
make
a
great
beer
for
the
summertime
d
smooth
and
crisp
the
finish
is
really
the
best
part
of
this
beer
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
on
a
hot
day
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
it
worth
drinking
for
a
while
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
i
cant
remember
ever
having
an
alt
beer
before
let
alone
an
organic
ale
i
was
pretty
impressed
pours
cloudy
rich
golden
in
color
with
a
moderately
thick
white
head
good
retention
and
plenty
of
lace
inviting
aromas
of
german
malts
apples
honey
estery
yeast
and
a
citric
hoppiness

lightly
sweet
but
with
a
dry
tarty
balancemalty
but
with
apples
tart
wheat
estery
and
a
malty
cookie
and
floral
finish
very
light
in
body
but
creamy
and
complementary
to
the
nicely
balanced
flavor
this
beer
gave
me
a
new
appreciation
for
alt
biers
very
tasty
stuff
very
easy
to
drink
very
good
d
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
alt
this
is
one
to
reach
for
d
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
easy
to
drink
but
isnt
anything
special
hazy
straw
yellow
pour
out
of
the
500ml
bottle
with
a
couple
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
has
some
sweet
banana
yeast
on
the
nose
but
then
the
smell
of
a
musty
barn
enters
faint
hops
in
the
aroma
and
taste
a
bit
of
lemonlike
tartness
mixed
in
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
im
not
real
familiar
with
this
style
so
i
may
have
to
come
back
to
this
at
a
later
date
d
overall
this
is
a
good
enjoyable
beer
nothing
crazy
going
on
but
just
being
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
its
like
a
chillout
beer
worth
trying
sometime
d
for
an
organic
beer
with
which
i
havent
had
much
luck
this
one
is
drinkable

something

100
per

a

good

especially
now
in
the
summer
time
sorry
i
cant
get
as
worked
up
about
this
beer
as
its
rating
would
suggest
alt
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
i
assumed
munster
alt
would
be
similar
not
so
the
appearance
is
fine
light
straw
with
a
decent
head
and
the
nose
was
encouraging
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
the
taste
delicate
but
bland
this
maybe
a
case
of
rating
a
beer
based
only
on
personal
perception
rather
than
judging
it
as
compared
to
other
examples
of
the
same
style
but
realistically
how
many
authentic
alt
beers
am
i
going
to
find
a
refreshing
enough
summer
quaff
once
the
bubbles
settle
and
agreeably
complex
if
a
bit
light
all
around
id
have
this
again
after
checking
out
a
few
other
instances
of
the
style
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
the
smell
was
mostly
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
spicy
and
slightly
grassy
hops
the
taste
follows
the
smell
starting
off
with
a
little
sweet
malt
that
gives
away
to
some
flavorful
hops
that
arent
overbearing
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
watery
with
some
very
refreshing
crisp
carbonation
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
doesnt
sacrifice
flavor
for
drinkability
d
goes
down
smooth
and
delicious
decent
drinkability
much
lighter
then
i
previous
atl
beers
almost
like
a
wheat
beer
sting
is
admittedly
problematic
as
this
is
not
a
necessarily
smooth
brew
that
being
said
it
can
be
dealt
with
quickly
and
the
lack
of
back
helps
this
area
out
overall
a
tasty
very
drinkable
alt
incredible
drinkability
d
very
smooth
and
pretty
flavorful
goes
down
real
easy
crisp
and
dry
i
only
had
one
bottle
but
easily
sessionable
drinkable
tasty
refreshing
d
such
a
nice
beer
with
fantastic
drinkability
could
easily
put
down
3
of
these
in
a
night
and
could
session
it
all
day
nice
light
flavors
yet
complex
and
flavorful
md
extremely
carbonated
and
not
the
smooth
creamy
yet
light
mouthfeel
i
love
about
alts
pretty
weird
however
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
in
the
summertime
but
over
a
good
hefe
or
german
or
czech
pils
or
lager
a
very
solid
delicious
brew
at
first
the
flavors
reminded
me
of
many
different
styles
and
given
what
ive
read
it
seems
that
this
beer
is
lighter
in
color
anyway
than
most
altbiers
nevertheless
this
one
is
infinitely
drinkable
and
tasty
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
gateway
beer
im
not
sure
how
its
being
organic
factored
into
the
taste
but
hey
its
organic
for
what
its
worth
d
interesting
but
not
incredible
its
a
surprisingly
solid
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
ill
necessarily
buy
another
bottle
d
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
no
real
bells
and
whistles
though
do
all
beers
need
bells
and
whistles
i
have
to
continuously
remind
myself
that
the
answer
is
no
paler
than
ive
come
to
expect
of
alts
but
manages
to
retain
quite
a
lot
of
malt
character
d
a
nice
unassuming
beer
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
relatively
low
abv
makes
for
easy
drinking
seems
like
a
good
session
beer
d
not
the
most
unusual
beer
ive
ever
had
but
crisp
refreshing
and
tasty
it
would
be
a
good
and
perhaps
excellent
pairing
for
a
wide
range
of
foods
im
especially
thinking

if
you
think
of
it
as
a

with

and
it
definitely
brought
me

i
think
this
is

its
not
as
dark
as
other

that
ive
had
and
seems
more
true
to
the

really
what
im
after
in

not

going

what
was
going

didnt
interest
me
bought
a
bottle
at
huckleberrys
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
big
white
head
the
big
smell
im
getting
out
of
this
is
honeyish
nice
lacing
the
taste
is
predominantly
the
honey
that
i
smelled
but
with
a
citrusy
hop
flavor
vying
for
attention
a
bit
paler
than
i
remember
the
alts
i
had
in
germany
but
a
tasty
beer
nonetheless
overall
different
dare
i
suggest
that
it
does
indeed
taste
organic
maybe
it
sounds
stupid
but
it
does
a
very
natural
earthy
aspect
to
it
which
for
me
dampens
the
overall
appeal
of
the
beer
a
little
this
brew
poured
a
full
head
of
finely
sized
white
bubbles
with
a
fair
lacing
this
brew
has
a
cloudy
dark
yellow
color
with
carbonation
rising
continuously
up
the
side
of
the
glass
it
has
a
citrus
flavor
with
a
hint
of
honey
full
bodied
and
flavorful
with
a
corresponding
citrusy
honey
aroma
i
can
tell
already
that
this
brew
is
going
to
go
down
well
with

poured
a
light

with
a
sizable
head
that
receded

fine

light
malt
and
hops
tast
is
smooth

with
a
little
sweetness
and
a
nice

finish
very
good
carbonation
and
very
refreshing
another
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
when
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
poured
a
good
head
and
it
also
had
decent
lacing
to
it
in
my
opinion
it
had
a
fruity
aroma
and
there
was
a
lot
of
carbonation
observed
this
beer
went
down
very
smooth
which
is
much
to
my
liking
and
it
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
the
third
installment
ive
had
from
pinkus
mueller
naturally
cloudy
gold
color
with
beautiful
snow
white
head
and

is
a

close

taste
also
is

a
pils

a

sweeter
nice
overall
beer

love
the

queen

dessert
or
something
flowery

flavors
lots
of
cashew
and
a
lot
of
persistant
mouthfeel
for
style
while
there
is
bit
of
hoppiness
its
more
like
a
seedy
skin
bitterness
that
permeates
the
sweet
side
from
middle
to
finish
not
a
dry
finish
at
all
lots
of
aftertaste
seems
a
lot
bigger
in
profile
than
many
alts
you
can
either
like
it
or
go
the
other
way
i
tried
this
the
same
day
that
i
had
copper
creeks
excellent
alt
this
isnt
bad
but
it
doesnt
hold
up
with
the
athens
ga
brewpubs
take
on
the
style
this
is
a
little
paler
and
has
less
of
a
hop
bite
but
it
still
doesnt
fall
into
the
realm
of
just
another
crappy
beer
called
alt
interesting
dull
gold
with
a
nice
foamyfrothy
head
and
trails
of
sliding
lace
the
aroma
is
faintly
of
yeast
malt
and
hops
the
malt
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
trace
of
herbs
lightly
limelike
citrus
hops
with
a
hint
of
cloves
the
alcohol
peeks
through
from
time
to
time
becomes
sweeter
and
more
evenly
balanced
throughout
this
is
a
gulpable
beer
i
kept
raising
my
ratings
as
i
drank
it
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
huge
ivory
head
that
was
tightly
built
over
a
hazy
apricot
colored
body
the
head
tended
to
depart
rather
quickly
but
it
left
behind
great
lace
deposits
from
the
filmy
residue
head
a
very
good
looking
beer
the
nose
seemed
to
build
as
the
head
lowered
and
the
beer
warmed
mostly
it
gave
off
scents
of
malt
and
yeasty
breadiness
from
the
medium
bodied
brew
very
creamy
and
mild
the
taste
is
mostly
sweet
malt
with
some
light
graininess
also
some
grassy
notes
finishes
somewhat
tart
and
has
a
long
aftertaste
that
is
bitter
in
the
front
clear
yellowgold
color
with
a
slight
haziness
and
a
towering
white
head
the
head
has
decent
retention
cereal
grains
and
a
dryish
spicy
continental
hop
smell
in
the
aroma
fleeting
veggie
smell
didnt
believe
it
at
first
not
terrifically
carbonated
and
llight
to

hoppy
and
a
rather
dry
finish
pretty
good
for
a
spring

toffee
some
slight
caramel
and
choco
notes
all
backed
up
with
an
unmistakeable
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
seems
quite
light
in
all
aspects
for
an
alt
but
yet
pretty
stiff
because
it
has
some
serious
alcohol
overtones
munster
alt
definitely
is
a
style
all
its
own
recommended
for
its
uniqueness
a
nice
organically
cloudy

the
head
large

frothy
the

the

noticeable
the
malts
and

also
present
and

is
quite
sweet
the

middling

is
a

the
acidity

with
the
hops

the

really
gotten
quite

nothing
i
must

again

that
ofallon
took
a
shot
at

even
this
overthetop
interpretation
its
not
unpleasant
in
any
way
but
for
me
theres
not
enough
malt
to
support
the
high
hop
rates
and
the
alcohol
which
to
be
fair
doesnt
taste
like
10
this
was

a

at

i
might
pick
this
up
fresh
if
they
were

it
up

id
have
to
give
this
one
a

i
would

didnt

some

do
taste
initially
was

as
it
warmed
the
thought
of
finishing
the
whole
twelve
ounces
seemed
like

task
i
agree
with
whoever
said
there
was
a
slight
medicinal

as
it
warmed
i
should
have
split
this

i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to

theres
the
addition
of
some
booze
molasses
and
a
medicinal

that
was
noticable

warmed

mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
slick
and
syrupy
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
more
i
drank
of
this
the
less
i
liked
it
i
dont
think
its
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
in
the
end
i
just
didnt
care
too
much
for
it
this
is
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
bit
of
booziness
which
will
keep
you
from
drinking
it
to
excess
it
is
also
a
great
example
of
the
style
though
a
little
bit
boosted
drinkability
a
little
strong
for
extended
sessioning
but
a
pretty
good
little
night
cap
overall
this
beer
is
a
mess
the
dark
fruit
up
front
is
overwhelming
the
alcohol
on
the
finish
is
way
too
hot
there
is
no
hop
taste
of
any
kind
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
off
theres
just
too
much
wrong
with
this
i
wont
have
this
one
again
pours
an
amber
color
with
absolutely
no
head
after
an
aggressive
pour
some
carbonated
bubbles
line
the
outside
of
the
glass
but
quickly
fade
appearance
resembles
tea
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malts
some
fruits
including
plums
and
fig
and
a
subtle
but
present
hop
presence
taste
has
plenty
of
caramel
but
also
has
a
sweetness
from
maple
syrup
mouthfeel
is
also
somewhat
syrupy
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
on
the
palate
as
well
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
truly
unique
and
a
new
style
for
me
taste
is
nice
with
the
sweetness
ill
sticke
it
to
my
taste
buds
with
this
brew
its
fullbodied
and
high
alcohol
lets
its
presence
known
it
has
a
dark
ans
cloudy
brown
look
with
a
ton
of
sediment
swirling
about
the
bottom
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
maple
syrup
and
plum
the
aroma
is
more
plum
with
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
orange
its
smooth
but
leaves
a
bit
of
a
tingle
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
its
very
nice
and
worth
another
try
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
with
a
thin
carbonation
there
is
a
light
creamy
texture
that
goes
down
smooth
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
at
10
abv
i
will
have
this
again
even
though
i
work
for
the
man
i
am
a
henchman
dont
ya
know
too
boozy
this
doesnt
make
a
bad
sipper
though
best
or
worst
name
ever
not
really
sure
which
yet
regardless
it
pours
a
clear
russetamber
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
sandy
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
maple
syrup
toffee
and
orange
peel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
toffee
orange
peel
and
a
strange
combination
of
char
and
rubber
blechhh
i
hope
this
is
just
a
bad
bottle
but
no
one
else
around
seemed
to
have
the
same
painful
experience
i
was
having
must
just
be
me
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
not
too
big
a
fan
of
this
period
reasonable
i
find
this
to
be
really
tasty
its
very
flavorful
but
also
high
in
abv
i
got
the
bottle
for
free
so
i
cant
say
much
about
cost
but
the
beer
itself
is
great
overall
as
long
as
it
doesnt
cost
a
fortune
d
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
something
seemed
off
in
the
smell
nothing
offensive
but
not
good
taste
was
slightly
better
but
the
alcohol
hurt
it
wouldnt
seek
out
again
for
a
scots
ale
this
would
be
pretty
good
as
a
sticke
alt
not
so
much
not
sure
what
they
were
trying
to
hit
with
this
but
i
call
it
a
swing
and
a
miss
not
impressed
d
i
foolishly
opened
this
expecting
a
nice
session
beer
and
didnt
notice
this
was
a
imperial
sticke
im
not
sure
ive
ever
had
a
craving
for
such
a
thing
dont
think
id
have
this
one
again
as
it
took
me
quite
a
while
to
work
through
all
12oz
d
flavors
are
easy
on
the
palette
able
to
really
take
in
the
complexity
the
abv
in
this
beer
is
very
hidden
sneaky
not
filling
but
the
thickness
probably
wouldnt
lend
towards
sessioning
a
sipper
for
sure
but
not
a
chore
to
drink
i
like
pours
a
clearish
icedtea
brown
a
fine
tan

stickes
it
to
the

and

and
other
assorted
good
candy
malt
hues
a
little
bit
of
spice
attempts
to
keep
things
in
balance
first
taste
is
hot
and
syrupy
a
few
unidentified
flavors
come
to
the
front
along
with
some
fig
an
alcoholic
presence
lingers
for
a
while
and
the
feel
is
viscous
and
finishes
bitter
interesting
complexity
afterthesip
drinkability
above
average
this
is
an
interesting
brew
but
borders
just
a
bit
too
much
on
the
medicinal
side
notes
strong
malty
yet
well
hopped
ale
that
drinks
like
a
lager
and
approaches

seemed
way

the

mediumfull

with
a
slightly

feel
a
little

onedimensional
alt
beers
are
one
of
my
favorites
styles
but
not
this
one
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
me
d
goes
down
ok
big
kick
somewhat
filling
ok
representation
of
style
i
wouldnt
grab
this
one
again
in
the
future
as
the
booze
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
mild
too
on
the
palate
perhaps
more
so
than
the
nose
a
bit
unpleasant
really
the
more
of
it
i
drink
tannic
and
chalky
boozy
a
bit
of
astringent
nuttiness
mild
tart
cherry
somewhat
grainy
quite
full
bodied
drying
finish
a
bit
oaky
it
seems
which
unfortunately
only
adds
to
the
tannic
woodiness
instead
of
giving
some
nice
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
im
really
not
sure
just
what
to
do
with
this
beer
drinkability
its
interesting
and
makes
for
a
good
sipper
but
its
definitely
not
something
i
would
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
due
to
the
higher
abv
the
flavors
are
good
but
again
not
something
that
i
would
like
a
lot
of
as
the
sweetness
and
booziness
really
become
a
bit
much
to
me
after
a
bit
as
well
drinkable
as
a
double
alt
can
be
i
like
where
ofallon
was
reaching
for
on
this
i
hope
we
see
more
such
as
this
in
a
4
pack
format
a
touch
warm
boozewise
i
would
happily
pick
this
up
as
a
seasonal
release
if
an
option
fruity

surface
in
the
taste
cantaloupe
or
melon
plum
dried
fruit
and
bitter
walnut

earthy
and
fresh
very
malty
a
rich

carbonation
is
somewhat
low
but
it
doesnt
distract
definite
sipper
d
very
nice
enjoyable
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
flavor
that
it
quite
delicious
not
amazing
but
very
good
and
it
hides
its
alcohol
well
its
a
pretty
far
fetched
alt
beer
but
i
see
similarities
with
the
olde
german
style
i
guess
if
you
add
steroids
to
hannen
alt
this
is
what
you
get
d
ofallon
had
their
abv
cap
lifted
and
theyve
gone
big
with
a
10
wee
heavy
and
now
a
10
altbier
this
is
quite
good
though
hazy
amberbrownish
color
with
a
tan
head
that
gives
way
to
decent
lacing
both
the
smell
and
tastes
are
a
good
combination
of
malt
and
floral
hops
very
refreshing
the
finish
is
neither
dry
nor
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
good
as
is
the
carbonation
level
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
with
hot
wings
which
i
did
and
with
the
lower
abv
it
is
an
excellent
session
beer
o
a
very
drinkable
amber
ale
that
was
refreshing
and
paired
well
with
my
food
at
the
brewpub
amber
in
color
with
copious
amounts
of
carbonation
bubbling
up
toward
the
surface
throughout
nice
white
head
on
top
maybe
an
inch
and
a
half
before
settling
down
to
coat
the
inside
of
the
glass
for
a
minute
interesting
aroma
mix
of
grains
light
bready
malts
and
a
touch
of
a
grassy
herbal
hoppiness
nothing
crazy
here
but
nicely
balanced
same
could
be
said
for
the
flavor
nice
pale
taste
light
bready
notes
balancing
a
herbal
sort
of
hop
lightly
sweet
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
o
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
didnt
really
dig
this
one
o
pretty
boring
though
this
styles
not
exactly
a
stunner
to
begin
with
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
from
the
nose
i
expected
to
be
blasted
in
the
body
but
the
flavors
are
nice
and
clean
if
this
were
available
in
pennsylvania
i
would
probably
pick
up
more
and
at
around
4
this
is
one
i
could
drink
all
night
poured
clear
brown
color
with
an
average
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
with
good
lacing
moderate
roasted
malt
and
tart
citrus
aroma
medium
body
with
a
sticky
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
medium
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
duration
my
expectations
where
met
overall
a
very
good
alt
or
amber
ale
it
more
balanced
than
the
american
pale
ale
from
this
brewery
i
noticed
the
brewery
packages
this
now
as
an
amber
ale
instead
of
an
alt
like
had
for
several
years
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
nearly
amber
with
a
loose
head
which
dissipates
rather
quickly
leaving
just
a
little
ring
theres
a
little
lacing
but
not
much
looks
about
average
id
say
the
smell
is
primarily
of
maltiness
very
sticky
and
sweet
munich
malt
id
guess
but
fairly
dry
in
the
smell
nice
minty
hop
presence
kind
of
slight
but
still
there
behind
the
sweet
caramel
smells
with
maybe
a
touch
of
chocolate
i
dont
know
if
i
just
love
the
noble
hops
on
top
of
the
sticky
malt
body
but
this
one
tastes
great
a
nice
malty
backbone
caramel
butterscotch
almost
nice
and
bready
a
bit
toasty
and
then
a
beautiful
minty
hop
presence
that
sticks
to
you
and
kind
of
washes
down
with
a
hint
of
lime
low
bitterness
almost
no
esters
this
one
is
nicely
balanced
malty
hoppy
but
not
american
hoppy
there
are
both
subtleties
and
very
obvious
tastes
here
that
are
all
pleasant
theres
a
kind
of
sharp
bite
of
carbonation
maybe
a
bit
much
accentuated
by
the
hops
nice
body
not
huge
kind
of
walks
the
line
between
thin
and
full
maybe
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
a
good
drink
nice
flavors
not
too
high
on
the
abv
overall
a
bit
challenging
interesting
simple
and
enjoyable
in
varying
degrees
and
phases
this
would
probably
be
my
choice
if
i
returned
copper
color
with
a
a
white
foam
head
and
active
but
small
bubbles
of
prickle
some
wheat
in
the
nose
that
blends
with
the
malts
in
the
way
that
hops
usually
does
this
is
an
interesting
way
of
creating
balance
malty
flavor
with
a
smooth
attack
and
clean
finish
simple
but
fair
beer
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
german
food
than
german
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
went
very
well
with
my
angus
burger
notes
from
021908
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
and
in
fact
i
resent
the
microbrew
of
the
month
people
a
bit
for
sending
it
to
me
nothing
that
special
here
but
its
a
really
good
drinking
beer
simple
clean
flavors
perfect
for
session
drinking
not
bad
or
undrinkable
not
something
id
seek
out
again
solid
amber
ale
brewed
in
the
old
style
pours
a
good
looking
light
amber
color
with
an
ample
head
decent
aroma
of
sweet
malts
countered
by
a
bit
of
dry
rye
smooth
and
easy
very
drinkable
good
flavors
of
sweet
and
toasted
malts
with
a
faint
noble
hop
bitterness
a
nice
ale
that
could
get
you
through
the
night
md
medium
bodied
but
a
little
flat
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
medium
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
for
the
style
lower
levels
of
carbonation
allow
this
beers
malt
character
to
shine
in
my
opinion
without
giving
it
a
soda
type
of
feel
carbonation
is
fine
and
lightly
dances
in
minute
small
groupings
of
bubbles
on
the
tongue
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
goes
great
with
a
medieval
themed
novel
or
moviemakes
you
feel
even
more
involved
in
what
you
are
watchingreading
this
is
one
i
recommend
a
great
offering
from
a
local
brewery
id
like
to
explore
this
style
more
before
coming
back
to
it
though
drinkability
is
nice
a
smooth
beer
but
not
incredibly
exciting
i
would
not
say
this
beer
was
bad
but
there
was
nothing
about
it
that
excited
me
pours
an
clear
amber
with
a
nice
head
good
looking
beer
displays
a
distinctive
herbal
aroma
the
flavor
is
light
malty
though
strangely
lacking
in
hop
character
the
moutfeel
is
nice
viscous
with
a
good
sting
of
carbonation
i
wish
this
beer
was
more
exciting
but
it
is
not
bad
for
an
alt
d
easy
enough
to
drink
but
a
little
disappointing
i
really
like
this
style
but
it
is
not
readily
available
though
not
a
beer
that
will
blow
your
mind
the
light
and
balanced
flavors
make
this
a
nice
session
beer
d
a
very
nice
beer
i
must
have
been
served
the
bitter
by
mistake
at
the
brewpub
none
of
the
fruitiness
and
a
very
nice
malty
flavor
w
bready
touches
and
a
dry
texture
that
makes
it
easy
to
return
to
i
consider
this
a
fine
alt
and
it
is
highly
quaffable
tasted
3308
the
taste
is
decent
bran
cereal
malts
with
a
pinch
of
wheat
and
organic
grain
it
does
a
decent
job
of
emulating
the
german
altbier
style
mouthfeel
is
overcarbonated
and
packs
a
lasting
bitterness
that
does
little
to
complement
the
flavor
overall
theres
not
much
in
the
way
of
excitement
for
this
beer
id
have
to
say
pass
if
i
ever
came
across
it
again
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
quater
inch
white
head
that
slowly
dissolves
away
the
scent
of
malt
strikes
the
nose
at
first
followed
by
a
light
grassy
fragrance
then
a
citrusy
lemon
scent
at
the
end
the
taste
is
strong
and
malty
with
growing
mild
bitterness
coming
in
halfway
there
is
a
metallic
taste
at
the
end
but
only
lingers
there
for
a
short
amount
of
time
the
feel
is
a
little
chewy
at
the
front
it
then
blend
to
a
very
consistant
medium
bodied
feel
there
is
a
tingle
from
carbonation
but
nothing
to
put
one
off
this
beer
could
be
very
good
session
beer
selection
very
solid
in
flavor
and
aroma
when
i
am
at
the
bbc
brewpub
this
is
a
good
go
to
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
head
and
almost
no
lacing
nice
scent
a
bit
malty
with
a
little
floral
but
not
very
strong
nice
taste
too
a
good
malty
beer
i
got
honey
overtones
but
that
may
be
the
smoothness
it
is
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
ever
had
very
good
very
tasty
i
would
drink
more
and
will
hopefully
be
able
to
try
it
in
may
when
im
in
louisville
really
loved
this
on
tap
and
brought
home
a
bottle
to
compare
the
lack
of
freshness
was
striking
and
really
took
this
beer
down
a
notch
while
the
adherence
to
the
dry
toasty
altbier
style
was
excellent
there
was
less
crispness
less
life
the
taste
was
a
touch
stale
certainly
well
within
the
best
by
date
bbc
does
better
by
this
style
with
a
fresh
pour
there
is
also
the
issue
of
the
fluorescently
lit
fridge
despite
the
brown
bottle
which
may
have
prematurely
aged
this
sample
see
my
other
reviews
of
bbc
beers
this
bottle
was
the
least
flawed
so
far
final
thought
i
like
it
a
solid
showing
from
bbc
i
just
wish
more
american
brewers
experimented
and
produced
the
altbier
style
because
it
is
an
interesting
concoction
i
dont
want
to
have
this
beer
again
it
is
not
overly
offputting
but
it
is
still
hard
to
finish
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
very
well
constructed
beer
not
much
flavor
and
slightly
muddled
drinkability
if
you
want
a
true
altbier
youll
need
to
look
elsewhere
this
is
a
light
version
of
one
which
some
may
enjoy
very
easy
to
drink
but
little
flavor
makes
it
dull
much
of
what
i
expect
from
an
altbier
is
really
ramped
up
in
this
one
it
looks
a
brilliantly
clear
copper
and
golden
and
pours
an
overcarbonated
white
loose
head
that
faded
but
laced
well
smells
malty
toasty
and
caramelly
alcoholic
phenols
penetrate
the
nose
tastes
slightly
roasty
and
malty
nice
frutiness
like
ripe
pears
and
to
a
lesser
extent
peaches
spices
float
in
the
background
nutmeg
and
corriander
american
hops
add
to
the
spice
and
to
the
flavor
sweet
alcohol
chases
you
through
the
body
and
into
the
finish
the
finish
is
clean
crisp
and
dry
a
bit
mouth
coating
like
butter
this
is
a
bold
alt
what
do
yo
expect
from
an
american
micro
a
whimpy
beer
not
here
pours
a
translucent
copper
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
decent
lacing
and
retention
smells
of
caramel
pine
and
a
creamy
coffee
upon
tasting
nothing
much
stood
out
it
has
some
soapy
malt
taste
some
nondescript
flavors
in
the
middle
and
a
mild
bitter
finish
i
cant
place
much
of
anything
its
not
bad
really
but
its
nothing
real
remarkable
its
fine
in
the
mouth
too
maybe
a
little
watery
goes
down
easily
for
the
most
part
but
nothing
is
drawing
me
back
to
it
so
two
thumbs
in
the
middle
got
a
mixed
sixpack
of
bbc
beers
from
my
brother
for
christmas
the
altbier
says
its
best
by
april
2007
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
little
to
no
retention
on
it
smells
like
a
classic
pilsner
bread
simple
grains
touch
of
hops
wood
a
little
musty
tastes
very
crisp
with
a
nice
malty
aftertaste
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
a
little
chemically
in
the
middle
overall
could
be
a
little
stronger
mouthfeel
has
some
nice
fizz
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
a
tad
watery
in
the
back
overall
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
nice
example
of
the
style
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
at
the
cincinnati
airport
the
beer
put
up
a
twofinger
light
tan
head
that
fell
slowly
to
surface
lace
the
body
had
a
translucent
goldenamber
appearance
the
nose
was
spicy
with
herbal
hops
and
slightly
sweet
toasted
caramel
malt
the
taste
was
toasted
a
bit
metallic
but
not
estery
this
beer
was
very
lagerlike
and
reminded
me
of
brooklyns
ofest
it
had
a
sweet
finish
and
little
bitterness
the
mouth
was
medium
and
there
was
a
lot
of
tingly
carbonation
an
easy
beer
with
nice
body
drinkability
pretty
easy
drinking
which
translates
to
not
a
lot
of
complex
or
strong
flavors
a
good
session
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
the
beer
poured
a
dark
bronze
with
only
a
half
finger
of
head
the
aroma
had
something
wrong
with
it
that
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
kind
of
a
corn
water
smell
like
when
boiling
cornonthecob
the
aroma
was
not
present
in
the
flavor
however
the
flavor
was
mainly
malty
with
a
little
caramel
not
much
hops
mouthfeel
was
good
its
a
silky
creamy
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
all
in
all
it
was
a
disapointment
drinkability
wow
its
good
i
had
some
spaten
last
night
and
i
must
say
i
think
i
like
this
better
ducks
i
could
definitely
drink
a
shit
ton
of
this
and
not
get
tired
of
it
it
seems
to
be
fitting
with
any
occasion
too
i
was
quite
surprised
by
this
one
drinks
really
easy
a
good
american
take
on
a
style
that
i
loved
over
in
germany
easily
the
best
of
the
bbc
beer
i
tried
this
beer
is
a
very
easy
drinker
and
one
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
down
here
in
the
hot
state
of
texas
this
would
be
my
summer
beer
of
choice
on
scorcher
days
easy
drinking
and
pretty
refreshing
pours
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
some
orange
highlights
maybe
a
half
inch
thick
head
that
fades
quickly
no
lacing
left
behind
very
weak
aromas
of
some
dark
malts
dark
dried
fruits
with
some
hints
of
molasses
and
a
smokey
aroma
to
it
some
flavors
of
dark
malts
fruits
and
finishes
clean
a
little
watery
mouthfeel
but
very
light
quite
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
i
just
wish
this
beer
had
a
stronger
taste
overall
will
not
try
again
i
travel
for
business
and
always
look
for
new
beers
this
is
my
favorite
style
and
was
diapointing
drinkable
with
a
nice
taste
but
the
thin
body
is
a
little
too
annoying
to
make
me
desire
another
that
said
it
smells
wonderful
spice
and
chocolate
dance
on
my
nose
if
only
the
taste
were
more
pronounced
this
would
be
one
killer
beer

not

a
pretty

one
worth

with

low

with

dont
get
a
chance
to
drink
an
alt
very
often
and
it
was
a
nice
change
overall
a
very
easy
brew
to
drink
not
heavy
but
refreshing
my
first
alt
it
was
golden
amber
color
with
a
whitish
caramel
head
quickly
dissipating
aroma
is
unusual
almost
like
over
ripe
fruit
but
cant
determine
what
kind
some
light
but
lasting
carbonation
slight
hoppiness
but
not
overwhelming
once
again
the
fruit
taste
was
noticable
but
still
unfamiliar
leaves
mouth
feeling
bubbly
and
sudsy
no
major
flavors
stand
out
just
hints
easy
to
drink
would
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
certainly
easy
drinking
and
pretty
darn
enjoyable
wouldnt
keep
away
from
it
but
wouldnt
go
searching
my
first
alt
in
recent
memory
i
think
i
may
try
a
few
more
of
the
style
this
weekend
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
profile
that
goes
down
easy
a
drinkable
beer
by
my
standards
and
one
i
could
see
as
being
a
good
crossover
for
the
macro
drinkers
a
solid
altbier
from
a
great
kentucky
brewery
per
bbc
website

gabf
bronze
altbier
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to

the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
and
fruity
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
there
is
a
nice
hop
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
altbier
it
has
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
drinkability
is
ok
not
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular

this
beer
is
very
interesting
to
drink
nice
malt
flavor
with
carmel
dominating
but
too
much
carbonation
gets
in
the
way
of
the
flavors
bluegrass
altbier
is
my
first
altbier
and
i
found
it
to
be
delicious
and
some
kind
of
drinkable
is
there
any
style
that
bluegrass
brewing
company
doesnt
do
well
thanks
to
sheepnutz
for
the
bottle
now
i
wish
that
wed
done
a
bigger
trade
pours

and
bready

notes
that
give

to

this
is
a
subtle
but
very
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low

all
in

quite
a
nice
effort
big
thanksymcgee

sheepnutz
for
the
bottle
tawnycopperyamber
in
hue
slightly
hazy
but
some
animation
is
noticeable
racing
towards
the
head
which
reached
a
finger
in
height
the
compact
bubbles
of
the
white
head
hung
together
well
in
other
words
the
retention
was
very
good
a
small
tight
cap
lasted
the
entire
consumption
impressive
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
and
it
didnt
cling
well
the
nose
is
pleasantly
malty
as
expected
for
the
style
there
is
also
an
airy
grassiness
that
is
mainly
at
the
front
the
malt
imparts
a
touch
of
toffee
and
a
very
weak
suggestion
of
peat
and
nuts
i
realize
neither
of
the
latter
two
are
typical
for
an
altbier
honestly
the
bouquet
seems
more
a
kin
to
a
märzen
and
a
scottish
ale
mixed
whatever
i
like
it
it
is
inviting
with
modest
potency
the
palate
immediately
tells
me
it
is
german
however
it
is
also
very
clean
like
a
lager
odd
the
grassy
hops
with
a
slightly
herbal
hint
and
only
modest
bitterness
say
german

the
hoppiness
is
good
but
the
malt
makes
this
beer
work
with
its
slightly
sweet
beginning
and
long
toffee
flavors
in
the
middle
at
the
finish
the
beer
dries
out
substantially
this
works
the
finish
is
muddled
just
a
bit
mainly
because
it
becomes
tacky
and
too
sweet
but
overall
the
palate
is
straightforward
and
tasty
if
not
overly
complex
this
is
a
good
clean
german
ale
medium
in
body
and
modest
carbonation
helps
produce
a
good
mouthfeel
this
is
plenty
drinkable
likeable
as
well
it
is
worthy
a
try
thanks
sheepnutz

easy

doesnt

me
its
alright
but
i
havent
fallen
in
love
yet
i
was
at
first
impressed
with
the
copper
color
and
the
creamy
head
but
the
head
quickly
sank
and
the
aroma
was
correct
my
first
taste
told
me
the
whole
story
it
is
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
there
was
no
bite
at
the
beginning
but
it
did
however
have
a
clean
finish

with
some
mild
bitterness
lingering
feel
is
close
to
medium
with
playfully
light
carbonation
fluffy
textured
and
floats
right
down
making
for
some
easy
drinking
a
good
session
brew
filling
in
a
calming
easy
fashion
with
just
enough
flavor
and
body
to
keep
it
interesting
thanks
to
brent
for
the
sample
pack
of
ky
beers
from
the
holiday
exchange
program
here
at
beeradvocate
happy
holidays
all
drinkability
very
good
session
beer
al
around
enjoyable
this
beer
had
a
medium
sized
ivory
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
the
body
was
very
murky
and
there
was
carbonation
observed
the
hue
was
dark
orange
and
the
lacing
was
good
the
nose
was
malty
and
hoppy
the
flavor
was
bitter
and
it
had
an
aftertaste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
smooth
thin
and
light
bodied
pours
a
medium
coper
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
head
displays
excellent
retention
soft
malty
aroma
has
hints
of
caramel
and
biscuity
notes
the
taste
is
initially
sweet
with
a
slightly
fruity
component
then
finishes
crisp
and
bitter
a
touch
of
sweetness
sweeps
in
on
the
aftertaste
but
is
quickly
replaced
by
the
lingering
hop
notes
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
an
interesting
flavor
combination
ill
definitely
consider
buying
more
of
this
on
my
next
trip
to
kentucky
this
beer
pours
a
clear
medium
reddish
golden
color
with
a
moderate
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
there
was
a
slight
cookie
smell
to
the
beer
the
taste
was
a
rounded
fruity
malt
with
a
tart
bitter
finish
and
firm
mouthfeel
overall
it
seemed
a
good
drinkable
beer
source
beers
across
america
tasted
at
the
barrelhouse
brewing
company
microbrew
fest
on
november
9
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
altbiers
but
this
was
okay
the
other
bluegrass
beers
i
have
tried
were
noticeably
better
though
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
lightbodied
malt
flavor
with
a
hoppy
and
slightly
nutty
finish
german
style
amber
ale
nice
amber
color
aroma
is
mild
and
sweet
but
flavor
is
not
as
sweet
moderate
hops
bittering
with
somewhat
dry
tangysour
finish
well
balanced
and
clean
very
good
beer
very
approachable
good
malt
very
creamy
and
smooth
making
this
an
enjoyable
malty
brew
what
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
and
id
have
it
again
but
i
cant
exactly
put
a
finger
on
what
is
going
on
with
this
beer
i
mean
it
tastes
like
a
beer
but
i
cant
pinpoint
the
style
hence
the
alt
categorization
this
altbier
old
beer
style
brew
pours
a
very
deep
reddishmahogany
in
color
with
a
good
23
finger
offwhite
foamy
and
creamy
head
that
finally
settled
down
to
a
good
3mm
or
so
after
a
good
bit
a
good
amount
of
ringlike
lacing
is
seen
as
well
as
some
sheets
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
dark
malts
with
some
hints
of
caramel
cocoa
and
biscuit
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
there
is
some
dark
fruits
figs
cherries
plums
with
some
brown
sugar
also
very
tasty
and
smooth
a
very
light
dry
hoppy
finish
is
noted
but
is
very
slight
which
actually
added
some
character
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
another
very
tasty
brew
from
this
brewery
odecent
alt
but
a
perhaps
a
bit
to
bitter
and
dark
could
use
more
malt
aroma
overall
a
very
solid
malty
alt
good
toasty
biscuit
malt
notes
with
a
very
nice
presence
of
fruits
overall
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
a
brown
ale
meets
a
german
dunkel
qualities
of
both
true
to
style
a
nice
take
pretty
decent
tasting
beer
considering
its
in
the
less
than
10
sixpack
range
of
beers
good
for
what
it
is
a
very
malty
brew
with
light
herbal
hops
o
the
initial
flavor
the
malty
backbone
and
the
sweetness
is
nice
but
there
really
isnt
much
holding
this
together
the
flavor
dies
to
quickly
i
got
this
as
part
of
variety
pack
which
is
good
because
even
though
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
would
not
by
this
in
a
six
or
twelve
pack
final
thoughts
definitely
ruined
by
the
aftertaste
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
bottle
though
because
the
rest
of
the
sixer
was
consumed
by
my
friends
who
didnt
seem
to
take
issue
with
its
flavor
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
at
the
brewery
o
love
the
schells
style
of
malt
forward
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
bold
deep
interesting
but
simple
flavors
brewed
the
old
style
way
done
right
great
for
cold
nights
very
good
altbier
the
beer
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
as
expected
is
very
malty
i
get
a
lot
of
bread
and
toffee
with
not
too
much
else
going
on
the
flavor
is
also
very
malty
there
is
a
lot
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
thrown
in
there
is
also
a
touch
of
grass
from
the
hops
overall
the
beer
is
very
dry
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
mediumlevel
of
carbonation
that
is
still
quite
soft
on
the
palate
the
resultant
mouthfeel
is
generally
smooth
and
creamy
wellflowing
finish
is
dry
making
you
want
another
sip
m
wet
throughout
the
sip
but
it
gives
way
for
some
nice
drying
aftertaste
is
pleasant
this
brew
simply
avoids
bitterness
and
compensates
with
extra
malt
character
like
eating
crackers
when
you
were
a
kid
sometimes
simple
is
tasty
o
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
and
a
great
bready
beer
that
you
can
drink
a
few
of
i
think
that
this
balance
could
also
be
interpreted
as
making
the
beer
too
muddled
and
i
do
agree
that
some
of
these
flavors
could
be
more
pronounced
than
they
are
schmaltzs
alt
shows
once
again
schells
really
knows
how
to
craft
solid
beers
nice
dark
amber
with
rededges
pour
smells
like
toffee
and
malt
and
tastes
about
the
same
i
really
enjoyed
the
subtle
caramel
taste
behind
everything
nothing
outstanding
overall
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
again
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
could
probably
be
sessionable
really
approachable
and
easy
drinking
i
would
have
no
problem
tipping
several
of
these
back
makes
a
nice
lighter
winter
brew
than
the
typical
crowd
i
found
a
variety
pack
of
schells
brews
at
the
store
thought
id
explore
their
offerings
and
take
down
some
tasting
notes
while
im
at
it
pours
out
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
at
the
fringes
of
the
glass
there
is
a
sand
colored
craggy
single
finger
head
leaving
behind
decent
lacing
body
is
much
lighter
than
i
had
expected
from
the
darkness
of
the
appearance
tastes
and
smells
of
heavy
breadiness
malts
some
minor
roasted
character
than
finishes
bitter
on
the
palate
along
with
a
light
earthy
hop
tone
pretty
good
o
i
had
to
drive
all
over
town
to
find
this
beer
it
is
a
great
beer
needs
nothing
added
or
taken
away
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
august
schell
for
the
price
this
brewery
makes
some
solid
beers
that
hit
their
style
pretty
well
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
nothing
really
spectaculat
just
a
decent
beer
i
would
go
to
it
in
a
pinch
for
sure
but
faced
with
other
options
i
would
probably
not
finishes
lower
on
body
but
very
drinkable
this
would
pass
by
anyone
who
just
drinks
it
not
very
complex
but
well
worth
it
this
is
a
lagered
ale
so
it
is
crisp
and
along
the
lines
if
a
dunkel
overall
and
average
drinkability
for
this
one
the
flavors
are
a
little
too
strong
for
a
session
yet
not
bold
enough
just
to
keep
drinking
out
of
interest
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
at
the
bar
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
unless
i
had
few
options
although
this
is
really
drinkable
this
was
passable
but
not
really
notable
drinkability
good
amount
of
characteristics
to
become
appealing
to
a
wide
variety
of
people
and
not
necessarily
offputting
in
any
sense
the
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
deep
garnet
hue
and
a
clingy
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
mediumlow
malt
bready
and
grainy
the
flavor
is
moderately
malty
sweet
bready
and
a
little
roasty
the
beer
finishes
just
a
bit
dry
and
hop
bitterness
is
low
but
combined
with
dry
subtly
roasted
flavors
it
is
well
balanced
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
body
mediumfull
overall
a
well
made
flavorful
north
german
alt
that
is
quite
drinkable
d
this
is
another
solid
brew
from
august
schell
that
really
nails
the
style
d
very
nice
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
worth
a
purchase
toasted

mouth
feel
is
warm
and
medium
well
carbonated
as
it
warms
the
palate
with
a
wave
of
malt
and
some
hops
the
flavor
is
good
but
not
robust
its
a
nice
winter
brew
that
went
down
fast
and
got
better
more
flavorful
as
it
warmed
d
great
i
am
not
versed
in
this
style
so
i
may
not
see
the
deviation
like
other
may
but
i
really
like
this
beer
one
of
the
finest
from
the
secondoldest
family
owned
brewery
in
the
united
states
decent
beer
by
schells
drinks
pretty
easy
not
a
classic
alt
imo
but
sessionable
enough

with
lighter
amber
along

smells
of
sweet

and
slight

the
style
of
an

crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
up
front
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
and
slight
hop
in
the
finish
overall
one
of
the
better
altbiers
ive
had
smooth
good
blend
and
a
nice
body
d
very
good
beer
lighter
than
one
would
expect
so
it
can
be
enjoyed
all
night
md
medium
bodied
a
touch
on
the
creamy
side
crisp
carbonation
which
seems
a
little
out
of
place
very
easy
drinking
purchased
from
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
pours
are
dark
black
color
with
reddish
hues
in
the
bottom
corners
of
the
glass
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
aroma
is
sweet
and
caramel
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
this
beer
has
a
smooth
sweet
taste
with
an
understated
hop
aftertaste
and
a
nutty
finish
good
beer
overall
my
second
beer
from
schells
and
i
am
impressed
again
very
sessionable
beer
that
i
wish
was
available
to
me
d
personally
i
could
drink
it
all
day
but
i
like
the
style
this
would
make
an
excellent
camping
beer
and
the
caramelly
malt
would
go
great
with
baked
beans
and
roasted
brats
this
will
be
worth
revisiting
every
late
winter
heres
the
deal
this
is
one
of
the
better
schells
beers
its
great
dark
and
roasted
but
light
and
easy
to
drink
hv
d
while
there
is
not
much
to
the
taste
you
could
drink
this
all
night
because
of
the
light
body
and
crisp
smooth
mouthfeel
dive
loved
this
beer
for
quite
some
time
now
its
an
interesting
beer
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
appearance
is
clear
brown
with
a
frothy
tan
head
aroma
hits
you
with
some
bready
malts
along
with
some
cocoa
raisins
toast
caramel
and
faint
flowery
hop
aroma
flavor
much
the
same
as
aroma
but
here
i
taste
a
little
smoke
in
the
background
malts
are
fairly
sweet
but
this
beer
is
clean
and
wellattenuated
the
higher
carbonation
scrubs
your
palate
and
leaves
you
thirsting
for
more
a
nice
dark
lager
that
isnt
heavy
or
sweet
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
sessionable
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
decent
tan
colored
head
that
falls
slowly
leaving
some
good
chunky
lacing
nuttiness
and
cocoa
in
the
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
citrusy
hops
in
the
background
flavor
is
of
some
toasted
malts
lightly
bready
and
the
slightest
hints
of
nuts
fruit
and
cocoa
powder
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
its
light
on
the
carbonation
and
goes
down
super
smooth
this
is
a
nice
alt
but
there
are
many
other
great
ones
out
there
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
good
darker
session
beer
for
the
winter
into
spring
time
although
spring
is
far
away
from
us
here
in
mn
very
drinkable
but
i
drank
alot
these
and
gave
me
a
killer
hangover
like
most
dark
beers
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
short
offwhite
head
smells
of
darkly
toasted
toasted
bread
the
hops
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
spicy
blend
of
herb
and
citrus
behind
dry
bready
cocoa
and
nuts
overall
very
tasty
and
drinkable
worth
picking
up
for
a
different
sort
of
alt
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
for
it
being
dark
also
it
only
has
5
1
so
you
can
enjoy
a
few
of
these
thanks
schells
for
bringing
this
wonderful
beer
back
i
really
appreciate
it
great
style
and
great
beer
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
as
well
as
english
brown
ales
schells
is
impressing
me
with
their
good
beer
which
sells
for
a
great
price
sessionable
and
would
be
nice
to
have
a
few
on
cool
summers
eve
or
a
typical
fall
evening
will
be
revisint
this
brew
as
well
as
sampling
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
d
what
a
great
beer
and
at
5
1
id
be
crazy
to
not
call
this
sessionable
great
job
schells
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
not
exactly
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
i
may
pick
this
up
in
doppelbock
season
it
seemed
kind
of
bockish
but
not
quite
as
powerful
this
beer
didnt
make
me
want
to
seek
an
alt
out
but
id
give
one
a
try
if
i
saw
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
may
buy
it
again
in
the
future
drinkablity
very
drinkable
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
several
bottles
of
this
well
made
its
great
that
august
schell
decided
to
bring
back
schmaltzs
alt
as
part
of
their
brewers
select
series
because
its
one
of
their
best
beers
too
bad
more
craft
brewers
dont
try
their
hand
at
this
style
a
sixer
every
winter
isnt
out
of
the
question
at
all
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
light
tan
in
color
creamy
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
cream
vanilla
and
a
mild
spicy
hop
note
the
taste
is
maltier
than
the
aroma
and
the
hops
arent
noticable
th
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
could
easily
drink
this
again
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
the
caramel
and
dark
fruit
are
upfront
being
backed
up
by
a
roasted
slightly
smokey
malt
flavor
i
would
of
prefered
the
malt
to
be
more
pronounced
and
the
sweetness
cut
back
but
it
still
is
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
no
hint
of
alcohol
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
slightly
out
of
whack
by
being
heavily
carbonated
for
the
style
i
would
buy
this
again
alcohol
could
have
been
a
tad
higher
for
a
winter
warmer
but
an
oll
round
decent
beer
d
pretty
great
tasting
beer
and
smells
nice
too
one
of
the
best
ive
tasted
from
schells
poured
with
a
huge
thick
rich
foamy
light
tan
luscious
textured
head
and
lots
of
lace
odd
aroma
and
flavor
of
bavarian
weisse
beer
otherwise
pretty
good
beer
opaque
brownish
black
very
soft
flavors
and
body
very
good
carbonation
could
be
a
session
beer
verdict
one
of
my
favorites
from
schells
a
very
sessionable
yet
dark
and
creamy
beer
a
bit
dark
for
an
alt
but
thats
a
good
spin
on
it
for
schells
schmaltzs
alt
was
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
large
light
tan
head
the
head
had
good
retention
and
left
rings
of
lace
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
sweet
dark
malt
and
a
little
roasty
the
taste
was
dark
malt
with
a
light
bitterness
chocolate
roasted
grain
and
a
touch
fruity
with
a
dry
finish
it
was
mediumfull
in
body
with
nice
carbonation
and
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkability
was
good
its
a
good
beer
that
i
will
definately
have
again
pours

ia
very
drinkablerefreshing
tasty
and
enjoyable
been
drinking
this
beer
for
over
20
yearsnever
disappointingsaying
a
lot
anymore
appears
dark
brown
with
a
tan
foamy
head
that
left
some
light
speckling
of
lace
as
it
was
consumed
aroma
is
sweet
with
ripe
fruits
and
caramel
some
nuttiness
comes
out
after
it
warmed
a
bit
as
well
the
flavor
starts
with
some
sweet
caramel
over
fruit
and
light
grains
notes
of
light
bitterness
and
nuts
come
through
before
the
sweet
fruit
finish
creamy
smooth
body
makes
this
go
down
very
easily
a
solid
very
drinkable
version
of
the
style
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
of
12
ounce
bottle
schmaltzs
alt
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
topped
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
chocolatey
the
flavor
is
not
what
i
expected
but
still
somewhat
nice
chocolatey
buttery
and
a
bit
acidic
some
fruity
flavors
appear
at
the
middle
most
notably
apple
and
plum
there
is
a
very
light
hoppiness
not
as
sweet
as
some
alts
mouthfeel
is
creamy
just
as
the
label
claims
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
dits
not
bad
and
very
drinkable
probably
no
more
than
three
but
a
nice
one
to
sip
for
sure
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nearly
black
dark
brown
with
ruby
tones
good
offwhite
head
and
thick
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
malty
and
nutty
kind
of
some
brown
sugar
mild
hops
and
faint
alcohol
taste
is
a
smooth
creamy
walk
of
caramel
malts
thickish
nutty
roasted
chocolate
malt
tones
mild
hop
bittering
for
balance
and
a
cool
but
warming
alcohol
finish
good
body
good
flavor
nothing
fantastic
just
an
overall
good
beer
i
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
pack
in
order
to
try
another
variety
of
schells
this
was
decent
but
nothing
special
i
felt
that
this
was
very
similar
to
a
porter
as
evidenced
from
my
comments
above
slightly
above
average
beer
is
awesome
going
to
but
a
6er
tomarrow
not
a
bad
offering
from
schell
poured
out
to
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
think
white
head
and
some
notes
of
lace
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
malt
toffee
and
tamed
hops
were
present
nice
flavor
was
nice
but
lighter
that
i
expected
flavors
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
with
wood
overtones
were
very
present
slightly
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
was
generally
good
but
nothing
special
a
decent
level
of
drinkability
this
is
not
what
i
would
think
of
when
someone
mentions
the
altbier
style
but
it
is
rather
good
nonetheless
recommended
dthis
sample
was
a
bit
smoother
than
last
time
but
it
still
has
a
strange
dark
burnt
malt
to
the
taste
it
taste
much
different
that
when
i
used
to
drink
10
plus
years
ago
i
remember
a
very
nice
rounded
malt
but
this
one
just
doesnt
have
that
character
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
creamy
brownish
head
and
a
light
brussels
lace
that
cascades
down
the
side
of
the
glass
this
alt
has
a
roasted
phenolic
aroma
this
mediumbodied
beer
posseses
a
smooth
rich
malty
flavor
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
dry
thirstquenching
finish
drinkability
and
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
suffers
from
the
same
problem
most
shcell
brews
do
lack
of
anything
special
its
nothing
great
nothing
to
seek
out
but
still
a
decent
solid
brew
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
color
smells
of
bubblegummy
malt
taste
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
juicyfruit
i
may
be
imagining
that
all
in
all
not
an
impressive
beer
here
its
tasty
enough
that
i
downed
it
in
no
time
flat
but
its
not
one
id
buy
on
a
regular
basis
just
a
decent
brew
nothing
more
pours
a
nearly
black
dark
brown
body
that
loks
more
like
a
porter
than
anything
else
pours
with
a
nice
creamy
12
of
tan
head
that
has
very
good
retention
smell
is
robust
with
roasted
malt
and
a
slight
coffee
scent
taste
and
mouthfeel
approach
the
porterstout
level
of
body
and
taste
good
coffee
and
bready
malt
flavors
with
mild
acidity
present
a
truely
great
beer
and
one
that
i
am
happy
so
see
return
to
the
schells
lineup
12
oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
some
light
manages
to
pass
through
it
there
was
very
liottle
head
on
my
example
what
was
there
was
tan
and
died
out
quickly
the
aroma
is
mainly
that
of
chocolate
some
sweetness
coming
through
also
the
taste
is
a
bit
roasty
with
a
subdued
sweetness
a
hint
of
fruits
in
the
tsate
also
im
sure
that
ther
are
hops
in
there
but
they
are
overpowered
by
everything
else
decent
i
would
have
rated
this
higher
if
i
was
rating
in
general
terms
but
versus
others
in
the
style
it
just
didnt
have
the
hops
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
classified
as
a
brown
ale
or
almost
a
porter
this
brew
is
a
black
colored
liquid
some
red
hues
when
held
to
light
with
a
small
tan
head
on
top
the
scent
is
dank
chocolate
malts
the
taste
of
this
guy
is
roastedchocolate
maltsoome
fruit
tones
nice
bitter
hop
bite
medium
mouthfeel
creamy
i
would
have
almost
thought
this
was
a
stout
if
it
had
a
thicker
feel
to
it
good
beer
i
seemed
to
like
this
beer
more
than
many
others
who
also
reviewed
this
beerpours
a
nice
mediumdark
brown
with
a
decent
slightly
off
white
head
aroma
is
buttery
with
some
light
malty
fruitinesstaste
is
very
buttery
with
some
big
toffee
notes
and
as
it
warmed
it
turned
into
a
raisin
like
flavor
i
think
a
real
nice
beer
if
drank
at
a
good
temp
a
nice
find
slight
smell
of
musty
shoe
leather
slight
pale
tan

deep
dark
purple
color
flat
plainish
malt
taste
that
is
not
interesting
at
all
there
is
a
slightly
sour
burnt
kettle
finish
to
the
taste
as
well
shockingly
tranparent
mouth
as
well
not
one
i
think
is
very
drinkable
brown
with
garnet
highlights
maybe
too
dark
for
this
style
kind
of
falls
into
the
dark
beer
category
but
then
theres
a
surprising
smoky
quality
too
a
taste
of
adjunct
also
appears
to
be
involved
i
guess
schells
is
trying
to
stride
that
middle
line
between
liquor
stores
and
beer
geeks
i
got
mine
at
an
iowa
liquor
store
because
the
ones
in
minnesota
were
closed
for
sunday
so
this
comes
off
a
little
less
than
it
could
be
its
says
on
the
label
a
dark
german
style
ale
i
was
expecting
a
deep
copper
due
to
the
alt
style
but
this
one
takes
on
a
similar
appearance
as
a
schwarzbier
deep
ruby
with
a
tan
head
leaves
efficient
lacing
nice
full
rings
at
that
aroma
contains
some
fruity
tones
based
from
the
malt
but
there
is
an
astringent
metallic
offness
in
the
background
taste
conists
of
darker
roasts
subtle
fruit
notes
and
a
standoftish
hop
character
overall
quite
nice
rolling
toasted
malts
mouthfeel
conists
of
soft
chewy
texture
medium
bodied
ale
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
i
am
fine
with
just
one
nice
beer
but
i
prefer
more
pronounced
flavors
nothing
from
the
august
schell
brewing
is
of
shock
and
awe
nature
color
of
very
dark
leathery
brown
nearly
black
with
amber
highlights
small
but
thickly
loose
tannish
top
that
fades
down
and
leaves
minimal
spotty

smell
is
faint
mild
roasty
malts
kinda
woodish
and
wet
dirtlike
must
taste
is
mild
somewhat
subdued
but
present
of
roasted
malts
maybe
black
malts
as
well
quite
clean
with
a
smokey
softness
a
bit
of
cocoa
and
a
over
all
mineral
like
taste
with
a
lingering
dry
finish
thats
a
bit
nutty
feel
is
a
lightmedium

quick
thin
start
quick
thin

nothing
to
overwhelming
its
a
very
easy
roasty
calm
beer
that
could
be
better
in
the
taste
but
is
still
a
good
drinker
goes
well
with
a
grilled
burger
pours
a
clear
very
dark
cocacola
color
with
a
very
nice
dense
tan
head
the
smell
is
earthy
and
grassy
malt
aroma
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
smoke
roasted
malts
with
a
burnt
aftertaste
mild
hops
and
hints
of
chocolate
it
is
full
bodied
with
a
rich
taste
and
finishes
with
a
lightly
dry
bitter
end
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beverage
imo
thanks
to
budgood1
for
this
cheers
a
big
dense
tan
head
is
noisy
but
slow
theres
some
spotty
lacing
the
beer
is
dark
coffee
brown
the
toffee
in
the
nose
is
slathered
with
butter
and
sugar
toffee
in
the
front
with
some
coffee
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
thick
fruity
malty
toffee
middle
turns
dark
for
the
bitter
chocolate
finish
that
butter
from
the
nose
comes
back
in
the
aftertaste
where
some
fruit
shows
up
again

by
the

just
a

in

that
doesnt
stop
an
overriding
fruitiness
to
continue
to
ride
throughout
the
flavor
and
the
finish
the
rest
of
the
drink
is
a
wellrounded
and
fruity
flavor
with
a
slightly
coppery
edge
im
no
expert
on
alts
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
this
is
that
as
it
sets
in
my
glass
a
deep
mahogany
almost
an
opaque
brown
the
head
is
commodious
the
texture
is

thanks
feloniousmonk
for
the

pours
a
nice

color
with
a
large
and
thick
head
which
maintains
nicely
throughout
a
nice
aroma
of
roasted
malts
some
light
hops
are
slightly
noticed
the
taste
of
caramel
and
black
barley
malts
are
followed
by
a
nice
light

sweet
taste
of
chocolate
the

are
tasted

a
sixer
i
would
buy
this
one
agian
great
price
for
a
decent
beer
an
interesting
beer
but
not
very
complex
pours
out
to
a
amber
almost
brown
color
somewhat
sweet
with
a
light
hop
presence
on
the
finish
i
honestly
can
say
i
liked
it
but
wished
it
were
a
little
more
flavorful
the
schell
brewery
is
a
nice
thing
for
the
folks
in
minnesota
and
the
midwest
to
have
around
pours
to
a
deep
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
leaves
a
nice
lacework
when
sipped
down
the
nose
is
one
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
rich
malty
roasty
with
hints
of
chocolate
the
malt
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
by
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
unfortunately
in
the
bottle
i
tasted
i
detected
a
metallic
flavor
in
the
finish
this
was
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
big
and
malty
overall
a
tastey
beer
deep
ruby
in
color
nice
looking
but
no
head
the
aroma
was
malt
with
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
the
flavor
was
pretty
simple
hoppedspicy
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
short
lasting
flavor
because
it
is
light
it
is
fairly
drinkable
not
bad
but
schell
makes
better
offerings
this
beer
is
a
deep
deep
copper
color
pretty
dark
for
an
alt
the
slight
beige
head
becomes
only
a
colar
in
seconds
lacing
is
negligible
a
fairly
distinct
hoppy
nose
on
this
alt
the
taste
is
very
nice
but
a
little
different
than
id
expect
from
an
alt
it
doesnt
have
that
nice
mellow
characteristic
typical
of
cold
lagered
alts
what
is
does
have
is
a
nice
blend
of
herbal
hop
notes
and
roasted
malt
tones
this
is
one
of
the
more
roasty
alts
ive
had
mediumfull
in
body
pretty
tasty
beer
here
a
good
stab
at
an
alt
but
not
my
favorite
id
like
to
see
more
of
these
type
of
beers
around
this
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
tried
from
this
brewery
and
have
always
had
a
fondness
for
it
although
it
may
not
be
a
classic
example
for
the
style
and
not
the
best
schells
beer
the
label
has
always
appealed
to
me
color
is
dark
brown
with
reddishamber
hue
in
the
light
head
is
sufficient
and
darker
in
color
aroma
is
light
overall
mostly
malt
with
light
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
fairly
full
much
more
malt
than
hops
and
not
particularly
bitter
finish
is
somewhat
dry
with
a
quality
of
hard
water
and
slightly
metalic
taste
nice
medium
mouthfeel
and
some
richness
to
the
drink
a
beer
ill
continue
to
buy
put
a
little
schmaltz
in
your
life
this
altbier
is
darker
and
maltier
than
the
average
alt
and
is
in
many
ways
more
of
a
porter
than
an
altbier
has
a
very
deep
dark
reddish
brown
color
pleasant
light
roasted
malt
aroma
featuring
faint
licorice
and
chocolate
notes
the
wonderfully
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
is
very
tasty
with
a
good
body
and
long
creamy
finish
the
last
time
i
had
this
was
close
to
five
years
ago
and
i
remember
liking
it
even
back
then
my
experience
tonight
is
not
so
good
i
get
a
definite
fruity
aroma
and
sweet
fruity
taste
with
some
chocolate
tones
this
in
noway
compares
to
the
alaskan
alt
i
had
a
few
weeks

i
thought
i
may
have
a
bad
date
but
after
checking
the
code
thanks
to
a
post
on
the
forum
it
appears
it
is
relatively
fresh
certainly
not
a
horrible
experience
but
i
expected
much
more
one
of
my
least
favorite
schells
beers
i
will
try
the
rest
and
upgrade
this
review
if
it
is
warranted
but
right
now
this
slightly
above
3
0
rating
may
be
a
bit
steep
i
look
forward
to
alts
but
this
one
was
a
little
dissappointing
in
its
bold
but
undefined
flavors
good
but
almost
greasy
mouthfeel
nice
aroma
and
color
was
looking
for
a
little
more
hop
and
dryness
too
dark
and
with
a
more
highly
defined
chocolate
tone
than
any
other
alt
i
have
had
and
not
really
to
style
not
bad
to
drink
though
looks
like
a
porter
without
much
head
the
nose
is
restrained
which
could
lead
to
a
variety
of
perceived
aromas
if
you
think
hard
enough
this
is
also
evident
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
its
too
restrained
the
usual
depth
of
coffee
chocolate
caramel
raisins
molasses
fruitcake
with
the
lightly
hopped
finish
are
their
but
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
nothing
outrageous
nothing
offending
notes
one
of
the
more
robust
altbiers
out
there
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
in
the
roasted
malt
flavours
this
could
easily
be
confused
with
a
brown
porter
none
the
less
a
tasty
brew
that
should
be
tried
by
all
smooth
sweet
balanced
amber
with
just
the
right
drink
ability
good
beer
to
drink
with
just
about
anything
and
for
just
about
any
occasion
our
little
red
rooster
strong
copper
color
like
a
shiny
lincoln
penny
sweet
floral
smell
very
smooth
taste
for
an
amber
pint
at
uncle
bucks
in
grapevine
texas
with
dodgechargercrew
for
an
amber
it
is
not
the
best
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
pacific
northwest
feel
and
taste
very
good
a
decent
amber
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
a
good
intro
to
the
style
overall
this
was
a
really
great
amber
and
a
great
beer
overall
too
sweet
offtaste
not
hoppy
enough
not
strong
enough
not
good
enough
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
worth
the
trip
to
juneau
had
it
at
the
brewery
and
was
amazing
not
a
very
good
brew
just
okay
one
of
those
ales
that
just
misses
the
mark
and
i
had
this
one
right
in
juneau
alaska
where
its
brewed
nice
smooth
drinking
amber
could
throw
back
a
few
of
these
best
alt
ive
ever
had
overall
a
nice
selection
of
flavours
and
a
pleasant
combination
of
sweet
sour
and
bitter
a
good
midrange
altbier
good
stuff
a
classic
and
one
of
my
favorites
much
better
on
tap
than
bottled
for
whatever
reason
this
review
based
on
the
bottled
version
well
balanced
amber
ale
that
tastes
a
lot
like
a
standard
brown
ale
i
used
to
enjoy
this
way
back
a
few
years
ago
i
think
it
just
doesnt
stack
up
against
others
of
the
same
style
i
based
this
rating
on
a
beer
i
had
on
draft
at
a
sports
pub
i
can
not
say
enough
good
things
about
alaskan
amber
it
is
creamy
without
being
thick
sweet
without
being
saccharine
hoppy
without
being
bitter
just
toasty
caramelly
i
realize
this
is
not
a
word
and
generally
perfect
i
have
tried
hundreds
of
beers
and
this
remains
a
mainstay
in
my
household
not
bad
very
drinkable
but
more
like
an
altlite
than
a
typical
altbier
deep
red
smooth
slight
bubblegum
or
fruit
good
stuff
solid
beer
smooth
and
tasty
overall
very
nice
solidly
built
and
tasty
floral
hops
toasted
caramel
malt
and
specialty
malt
fruitiness
form
the
aroma
flavor
is
based
in
specialty
malt
fruitiness
with
a
caramel
malt
backbone
floral
notes
and
a
touch
of
a
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
brew
almost
like
yummy
bread
well
balanced
had
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
on
alaskan
air
it
was
just
okay
but
compared
to
their
other
choices
it
was
the
best
available
really
good
amber
its
smooth
and
makes
you
want

another
very
smooth
beer
from
alaskan
no
overpowering
hops
just
right
on
the
hoppy
side
enjoyable
beer
with
a
very
slight
honey
aftertaste
a
little
high
on
the
carbonation
a
little
above
medium
carbonation
i
like
medium
carbonation
would
have
been
a
higher
rating
if
the
carbonation
was
lighter
medium
body
to
slightly
less
medium
to
a
little
above
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
an
altbier
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
would
expect
from
the
style
and
it
had
some
nice
balance
with
no
off
flavors
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
clean
crisp
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
decent
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
especially
in
the
fall
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
it
was
a
straight
up
true
example
of
an
altbier
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
about
this
beer
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
altbiers
or
malty
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
just
what
i
expect
from
a
good
altbier
and
nothing
else
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
think
its
close
to
being
one
of
the
better
altbiers
out
there
good
job
guys
this
was
a
nice
tasting
altbier
keep
up
the
solid
work
overall

id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
if
it
were
on
tap
and
my
other
choices
were
not
as
good
i
would
choose
alaskans
amber
beer
im
not
sure
if
alaskan
considers
themselves
to
be
a
craft
beer
but
as
of
now
from
what
ive
tried
id
rate
them
only
slightly
better
than
shock
top
taste
palate
first
up
is
a
medium
body
mix
of
bready
sweet
maltiness
blending
with
the
same
dark
fruit
notes
from
the
the
aroma
the
finish
adds
notes
of
roasted
almond
and
a
mild
balance
of
earthy
dryness
from
hops
the
palate
feels
smooth

somewhat

lovers
dream
o
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
after
tasting
many
other
beers
alaskan
amber
seems
almost
light
the
flavor
is
fine
the
carbonation
seems
a
bit
much
for
this
style
needs
more
malt
and
less
co2
it
gets
the
alt
style
but
its
not
my
favorite
overall
alaskan
amber
is
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
alt
style
ale
it
has
some
winelike
qualities
due
to
the
fruit
flavors
most
excellent
o
good
drinkability
a
bit
too
sweet
nevertheless
quite
pleasant
smooth
and
easy
drinking
recommended
alaskan
amber
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
nice
decent
size
frothy
head
there
is
a
weak
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
very
light
has
some
nice
biscuit
flavors
near
the
end
with
a
noticeable
malty
flavor
a
little
flat
and
very
weak
flavors
overall
it
has
nice
flavors
but
its
just
too
weak
o
better
than
i
expected
but
not
extravagant
this
is
a
pleasant
brew
for
relaxation
and
sessioning
not
the
balls
but
good
regardless
overall
very
good
brew
i
think
i
may
have
a
new
top
favorite
to
add
to
the
list
with
this
one
httpyoutu
beraxcbijexus
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
catalina
brewing
company
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
copper
color
not
much
retention
or
lacing
smell
is
malt
biscuit
molasses
and
a
little
yeast
taste
is
different
than
i
expected
i
thought
this
would
be
more
of
a
newcastle
type
brown
ale
but
its
not
taste
is
more
sweet
than
expected
malt
molasses
and
brown
sugar
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
finish
guess
its
more
an
altbier
than
anything
pretty
decent
brew
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
n
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
went
great
with
the
salmon
bake
in
juneau
where
i
tried
this
lucky
to
have
that
experience
lacks
complexity
or
a
large
character
but
certainly
one
to
try
and
to
enjoy
dark
copper
with
good
clarity
super
dense
head
with
good
retention
white
fluffy
aroma
is
caramel
and
bananas
makes
me
think
of
a
dunkelweizen
caramel
toffee
flavors
with
a
lingering
sweetness
on
the
finish
much
sweeter
with
more
yeast
character
than
other
alts
ive
sampled
which
i
assume
were
more
of
the
dusseldorf
style
strong
malt
character
but
just
too
sweet
for
me
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
mediumlow
to
low
carbonation
levels
leading
to
a
beer
that
has
a
smooth
35
and
slightly
foamy
25
mouthfeel
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
coating
the
lips
and
palate
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
enjoy
nothing
is
offputing
but
nothing
stands
out
either
good
balance
but
id
say
definitely
malt
forward
i
wish
the
co2
was
adjusted
upwards
a
bit
overall
above
average
nothing
amazing
but
also
nothing
that
disappoints
i
would
give
it
a
try
o
this
beer
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
but
it
definitely
isnt
bad
i
really
enjoy
the
caramel
flavors
that
you
get
in
the
after
taste
the
color
of
the
beer
is
also
quite
nice
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
this
again
but
im
in
no
rush
to
go
out
and
buy
more
id
say
give
it
a
try
if
youre
into
ambers
o
this
beer
is
quite
malty
but
there
are
enough
underlying
hops
so
it
isnt
rendered
undrinkable
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
all
of
the
complexity
as
german
altbiers
o
nothing
really
special
here
its
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
bitter
better
than
a
lot
of
beer
out
there
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
o
after
i
finished
this
beer
it
felt
like
i
had
just
eated
a
rolo
good
beer
smell
malty
sweet
this
beer
is
a
winner
as
an
everyday
beer
given
that
six
packs
are
going
for
7
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
you
really
cant
beat
the
bang
for
your
buck
its
tasty
easydrinking
and
smooth
this
is
an
easy
choice
for
showing
up
at
a
party
with
a
small
cheap
offering
overall
a
pretty
average
amber
ale
a
tab
bit
bitter
and
not
unique
by
any
means
but
a
decent
choice
given
limited
selection
as
out
here
in
the
northwest
it
is
a
pretty
common
beer
even
at
places
that
only
have
a
few
choices
amber
in
color
and
i
saw
another
poster
mention
cheerios
when
describing
the
smell
and
color
actually
i
think
that
is
pretty
spot
on
so
i
will
go
with
that
i
generally
drink
out
of
a
bottle
drank
at
my
wedding
due
to
limited
beer
choices
no
kegs
allows
only
bottles
only
bottles
the
venue
carried
poured
into
a
pint
glass
chilled
down
to
36
degrees
in
my
beer
cooler
poured
into
a
pilsner
8ball
pool
ball
glass
i
have
the
whole
set
of
15
glasses
pours
a
pretty
copperbronze
in
color
with
really
no
head
to
speak
of
just
a
bit
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
just
some
malthops
the
taste
was
actually
very
pleasant
with
a
slight
nutty
hint
very
smooth
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
never
had
this
style
of
brew
before
and
liked
it
overall
thick
creamy
head
was
the
first
thing
i
noticed
not
a
bad
beer
less
flavorful
than
i
expected
i
would
buy
again
if
selection
was
limited
overall
a
slightly
better
than
okay
beer
good
color
decent
aroma
a
beer
you
could
have
multiples
of
at
one
sitting
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
this
makes
me
want
to
grab
a
few
more
these
amber
beer
onice
representation
of
the
style
i
am
not
a
huge
amber
fan
but
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
nice
looking
pour
with
a
surprisingly
light
colored
foamy
head
clear
burnt
orange
appearance
is
also
pretty
pleasant
nose
is
mainly
nutty
before
the
maltiness
takes
ovee
with
the
taste
strictly
following
the
noses
lead
the
taste
initially
bares
a
nuttiness
that
ever
so
briefly
presents
a
faint
banana
essence
before
the
malts
overwhelm
all
else
finish
is
blech
with
a
cloying
sweetness
pretty
high
level
of
carbonation
here
as
wwll
overall
this
is
fairly
average
o
above
average
beer
but
i
like
the
alaskan
ipa
better
poured
a
rich
amber
with
almost
no
head
what
head
formed
was
an
offwhite
it
got
the
amber
part
down
but
its
nothing
too
special
scents
of
sweet
malt
bubblegum
and
slight
banana
pleasant
matches
well
with
the
flavor
but
again
nothing
too
special
flavors
of
sweet
malt
a
little
bit
of
toffee
and
a
slight
nutty
flavor
on
the
finish
pretty
nice
similar
to
a
brown
ale
but
with
a
slightly
more
german
flavor
profile
hop
character
is
low
but
is
present
balancing
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
good
for
a
session
beer
overall
id
say
its
a
pretty
good
beer
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
session
ale
overall
a
nice
amber
the
beer
is
friendly
but
a
little
lacking
in
character
rjt
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
the
carbonation
kind
of
detracts
from
it
for
me
digging
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
the
bubbles
are
a
bit
too
intense
o
i
really
enjoy
altbiers
as
they
blend
the
best
of
ales
and
lagers
together
this
is
a
tad
too
sweet
and
i
would
to
have
seen
a
bit
more
of
the
lager
side
to
quell
the
sweetness
not
bad
at
all
though
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
going
in
but
i
am
leaving
the
alaskan
amber
very
impressed
this
makes
me
want
to
grab
a
few
more
ambers
to
compare
this
original
recipe
is
from
1900
i
dont
think
this
beer
will
age
that
long
cheers
everyone
o
i
like
it
id
drink
it
again
nothing
special
at
all
but
i
do
enjoy

is

not

not

had
on

to

easy

great
session
beer
having
only
one
on
the
day
id
reach
for
something
a
little
more
interesting
this
is
a
good
choice
for
an
american
made
amber
ale
without
the
overbearing
hop
profile
which
the
west
coast
has
imposed
on
the
style
it
compares
well
with
british
pale

just

can
never

on
it
like
they
have
in

picture
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
aromas
the
aromas
of
some
grains
and
toast
come
through
with
some
caramel
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
sweet
with
a

in

the

and
toast

balance

the

my

best
of

so
far
if
im

would

on

obo
drinkability
a
very
nice
alt
not
sure
why
they
call
this
an
amber
notes
this
one
deserves
a
second
try
if
only
because
i
am
left
with
the
feeling
that
this
may
not
be
a
fresh
bottle
at
least
in
the
sense
that
i
was
expecting
a
rather
different
hop
profile
d
a
really
easy
going
beer
easy
to
see
why
its
so
popular
flavor
follows
in
the
direction
of
the
malt
with
a
toasted
grain
and
a
thin
caramel
sweetness
yet
finishing
clean
and
somewhat
dry
feel
begins
rather
creamy
but
lightens
as
the
carbonation
escapes
yielding
a
somewhat
thin
but
not
quite
watery
close
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
malt
flavors
linger
nicely
throughout
however
decent
drinkability
well
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
drinkability
im
finding
this
to
be
quite
a
drinkable
beer
it
plays
well
with
a
band
jam
session
a
serviceable
amber
passable
beer
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
yard
house
scottsdale
a
little
sournesslike
a
drp
of
cherry
fruitiness
which
also
gave
it
an
edgy
drinkability
a
bit
amber
colour
a
little
lace
hops
there
and
decent
balance
average
mouthfeel
not
only
will
i
not
have
this
beer
again
it
firmly
plants
altbier
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
of
beer
styles
i
wish
this
beer
suited
my
taste
buds
but
it
didnt
i
guess
im
not
crazy
about
overly
sour
brews
what
the
what
this
is
an
alt
the
body
was
a
too
light
and
somewhat
watery
but
i
suppose
a
lighter
body
aids
the
ability
to
pound
em
this
has
enough
flavor
and
drinkability
to
be
highly
sessionable
if
you
dont
want
to
be
challenged
too
much
excellent
for
a
newbie
drinkability
is
okay
a
session
type
ale
a
bit
too
sweet
and
simple
for
my
taste
though
to
drink
many
of
them
still
a
nice
enough
beer
but
really
nothing
to
get
excited
about
expecting
an
american
amber
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
subdued
bitterness
and
rich
maltyfruity
character
checking
ba
the
altbier
description
seems
well
placed
best
had
around
5560
degrees
as
thats
when
the
great
character
of
this
beer
seems
to
peek
out
d
very
sessionable
not
a
bad
beer
while
watching
the
fight
or
having
family
over
d
acceptable
beer
but
nothing
i
have
not
tried
in
other
beers
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
smell
is
malty
and
fruity
sweet
malty
taste
this
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
medium
bodied
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
out
there
but
this
is
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
i
dont
know
what
everyone
else
seems
to
be
tasting
when
they
state
that
this
beer
has
aggressive
hops
this
is
a
traditional
alt
style
beer
and
has
much
in
common
flavor
wise
with
a
german
pils
or
czech
lager
the
color
is
medium
copper
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
an
average
lace
the
nose
is
faint
but
appealing
with
notes
of
apple
and
a
slight
hint
of
spice
maybe
cinnamon
the
palate
is
all
lager
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
remember
altbier
was
made
before
lager
and
despite
being
top
fermented
they
share
much
in
common
with
lagers
are
far
as
flavors
the
traditional
lager
character
that
kind
of
old
bubble
gum
flavor
is
present
but
it
nudges
out
any
other
discernable
flavors
the
texture
is
light
and
doesnt
suit
the
beer
all
that
much
it
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
though
i
could
probably
only
top
off
two
since
it
is
rather
boring
better
than
mass
production
american
lagers
and
pilsners
but
lacking
any
real
identity
drinkability
alaskan
amber
is
a
smooth
tasty
brew
id
gladly
drink
it
after
two
straight
days
of
crabbin
especially
since
itd
probably
the
only
thing
available
d
on
a
hot
day
a
few
could
ones
of
these
would
be
a
welcome
treat

drinkability
a
tasty
malty
and
very
sessionable
altbier
i
like
the
hint
of
fruit
in
the
taste
another
great
camping
beer
despite
the
sting
the
carbonation
is
mild
and
doesnt
interrupt
the
palate
it
leaves
room
something
a
bit
more
distinguishing
flavorwise
d
very
drinkable
however
my
recommendation
is
to
consume
only
a
few
since
they
are
a
bit
heavy
and
amber
d
very
easy
to
drink
it
goes
down
well
a
good
session
beer
this
was
a
beer
i
drank
a
lot
years
ago
when
the
microbrew
craze
was
in
its
infancy
having
searched
out
bigger
badder
brews
over
the
years
ive
shunned
this
one
as
being
too
pedestrian
i
am
convicted
of
my
snobbishness
by
how
much
i
enjoy
this
beer
a
solid
session
beer
and
one
i
will
drink
again
when
i
dont
need
a
west
coast
hopfix
d
a
very
enjoyable
altbier
dont
have
too
many
experiences
with
the
style
right
now
to
compare
but
this
was
my
third
alaskan
amber
and
i
enjoy
it
every
time
extremely
drinkable
overall
a
solid
goto
microbrew
and
one
of
my
main
choices
at
local
bars
restaurants
or
concerts
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
solid
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
substance
that
makes
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
well
maybe
thats
why
it
was
on
special
for
3
25
i
dont
know
just
was
very
unimpressed
um
i
probably
should
have
just
spent
the
extra
1
25
to
get
something
really
worth
drinking
well
i
know
better
next
time
i
do
have
a
nice
buzz
though
also
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
the
bottle
design
on
the
label
this
is
a
good
beer
something
i
would
recommended
pours
with
a
nice
head
that
dissipates
quickly
into
nothing
with
no
lacing
great
brilliant
copper
color
not
much
smell
a
little
sweet
malt
light
sweetness
on
the
taste
buds
a
little
malty
medium
mouth
feel
with
a
good
of
fizz
the
flavor
is
slight
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
session
beer
but
not
for
amazing
your
taste
buds
as
its
a
little
boring
after
two
pints
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
as
expected
does
not
blow
you
off
but
is
easy
to
put
down
overall
this
is
really
nice
drinks
really
fast
an
i
coulda
easily
kill
several
pints
of
this
fine
brew
wish
i
could
get
it
in
oklahoma
d
very
drinkable
if
i
could
get
it
out
in
pa
it
would
definitely
be
a
regular
d
very
enjoyable
and
sessionable
beer
notes
bbcsd0905geoffv
first
alt
looks
great
but
that
doesnt
translate
to
mind
blowing
smells
like
faint
ale
like
watered
down
anchor
steam
and
i
think
it
tastes
like
that
too
not
good
not
bad
but
definitely
a
weaning
product
for
your
freinds
or
a
session
beer
not
alot
going
on
but
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
them
and
not
feel
overpowered
dark
amber
in
color
lots
of
bubbles
and
active
prickle
upon
pouring
but
the
bubbles
dissipate
pretty
quickly
no
head
smooth
and
fruity
malt
nose
with
hints
of
banana
strong
attack
that
is
refreshing
and
has
some
effervescence
the
flavor
is
definitely
based
in
grains
but
they
are
there
to
taste
and
not
to
dominate
pretty
clean
and
easy
there
are
some
sour
notes
at
the
finish
and
hints
of
nut
as
well
these
qualities
carry
into
the
aftertaste
it
seems
to
be
robust
for
the
alt
beer
variety
dark
brown
body
with
creamy
tan
onefinger
head
decent
lacing
malts
predominate
the
nose
with
roasty
malt
taste
but
the
hops
are
fairly
well
hidden
active
mouthfeel
pretty
sessionable
and
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
but
nothing
spectacular
the
beer
is
mild
in
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
very
wimpy
beige
head
that
fizzles
into
almost
nothing
within
a
minute
of
pouring
nice
full
aroma
despite
the
lack
of
head
with
a
big
graham
cracker
character
munich
maltiness
and
some
honey
flavor
is
very
similar
with
additional
accents
of
grassy
hops
toffee
and
even
a
touch
of
candied
orange
a
little
light
in
body
and
carbonation
very
drinkable
a
good
brew
would
work
well
with
a
sausage
peppers
grinder
a
fine
example
of
a
style
i
dont
get
to
enjoy
enough
worth
trying
it
if
you
see
it
out
somewhere
a
stubby
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
this
altbier
appears
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
dense
light
ecru
foam
no
lacing
to
mention
nose
and
flavors
are
of
medium
toasted
grains
caramel
malts
grassy
slightly
fragrant
bitter
hops
about
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
for
the
style
worth
checking
out
pours
a
nice
attractive
amber
color
with
a
pretty
decently
constructed
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
spicy
musty
fruity
and
malty
taste
is
a
spicy
malt
with
hints
of
citrus
fruit
and
berries
mouthfeel
is
a
good
body
that
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
refreshing
brew
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
a
good
representation
of
the
style
it
seems
to
be
one
of
the
more
widely
distributed
micros
in
the
pacific
northwest
the
sam
adams
or
goose
island
of
its
region
and
it
represents
the
everyday
craft
beer
title
very
well
a
good
reliable
brew
thats
pretty
easy
to
find
in
the
nw
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
c
a
really
great
beer
that
seems
to
be
brewed
to
style
a
great
beer
and
definitely
one
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
though
not
a
session
beer
due
to
its
slightly
higher
color
is
a
light
brownish
amber
color
with
a
crisp
easily
dissapating
light
beige
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
no
hops
flavor
of
sweet
brown
malt
with
a
slight
bittersweet
finish
more
like
a
brown
ale
than
an
alt
mouthfeel
is
low
with
little
belgian
lacing
drinkability
very
good
this
beer
could
be
consumed
during
any
festivity
or
occasion
by
a
wide
variety
of
palettes
good
mass
appeal
i
usually
expect
more
smokiness
in
an
altbier
but
this
was
still
enjoyable
i
found
this
in
a
small
liqour
storetavern
while
passing
through
wheatland
wyoming
on
a
recent
business
trip
while
they
did
have
guinness
and
a
few
other
premium
beers
the
alaskan
amber
was
the
only
craft
beer
in
stock
will
wonders
never
cease
since
alt
used
to
be
a
favorite
style
of
mine
thanks
to
frankenheim
i
was
happy
to
give
it
a
try
altbier
tends
to
be
a
very
mild
inoffensive
brew
with
little
hop
charactor
well
suited
for
extended
consumption
and
that
pretty
well
describes
alaskan
amber
the
appearence
was
a
deep
brown
typical
of
the
style
with
a
nice
head
somewhat
thin
body
a
flavour
more
malty
than
hoppy
and
just
very
mild
all
the
way
around
maybe
my
tastes
have
changed
or
maybe
this
is
just
an
unremarkable
beer
the
best
thing
this
beer
has
going
is
its
drinkability
no
real
off
flavors
and
no
real
flavors
mild
is
a
good
word
to
describe
this
beer
it
seems
to
lack
the
bitterness
and
dry
finish
expected
of
the
altbeir
style
these
comments
do
not
distract
from
my
overall
impression
they
are
meant
as
a
commentary
on
hitting
the
style
guidelines
drinkability
would
try
again
easy
to
drink
but
maybe
as
a
second
or
third
choice
of
available
beers
d
a
bit
too
sweet
and
cloying
but
ok
a
good
value
thanks
to
colts9016
for
this
one
12
oz
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
reddish
gold
amber
perhaps
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
caramel
malt
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
sweetness
light
to
medium
bodied
malt
predominates
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
some
hop
bitterness
helps
to
balance
things
out
easy
drinking
beer
but
pretty
unremarkable
imo
verdict
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
its
getting
as
easy
to
find
as
sam
adams
and
its
always
good
to
have
a
safe
back
up
beer
note
as
far
as
i
can
see
this
beer
meets
the
bjcp
guideline
with
the
exception
of
taste
here
while
appealing
there
is
a
departure
overall
alaskan
amber
is
one
of
my
favorite
altbiers
and
i
would
recommend
anything
from
this
brewery
d
a
fair
altbier
d
goes
down
very
smoothly
not
much
like
the
strong
alt
biers
and
amped
up
versions
so
this
was
a
nice
touch
great
to
pair
with
food
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
i
think
i
was
just
used
to
the
stickes
this
is
far
different
d
very
drinkable
interesting
flavors
and
quite
surprising
at
that
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
one
i
will
certainly
go
back
for
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
ok
drinkability
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
again
however
i
would
try
more
brews
from
this
brewery
a
pint
of
alaskan
amber
arrived
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
shimmering
copper
color
and
minimal
foam
floating
above
caramel
tinged
roasted
hops
was
balanced
in
the
aroma
by
a
light
floral
hoppiness
a
big
malt
and
grainy
flavor
on
the
palate
up
front
followed
by
a
semijuicy
center
and
a
quick
finish
a
solid
session
ale
from
the
sweeter
end
of
the
spectrum
definitely
drinkable
d
this
beer
is
smooth
and
drinkable
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
malts
and
hoppy
bitterness
although
i
would
prefer
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
d
very
enjoyable
nicely
balanced
i
only
wish
i
had
more
thanks
donkeyrunner
d
easy
very
easy
to
drink
doesnt
spend
much
time
in
the
mouth
without
a
struggle
somewhat
crisp
for
an
amber
ale
tastes
just
like
it
smells
with
a
toasty
orange
spice
flavor
at
4
abv
this
is
my
ideal
session
beer
d
a
nice
drinkable
beer
pours
a
perfect
amber
with
a
fluffy
cream
colored
cap
that
retains
for
a
moment
or
two
before
leaving
some
hawaiian
island
lacing
this
looks
very
nice
and
inviting
the
nose
is
a
interesting
blend
of
subtle
fruitmostly
strawberry
and
caramel
malts
lightly
roastedhoney
oat
bread
crust
as
well
this
taste
uniquely
like
it
smells
strawberry
marshmallow
notes
and
very
fresh
maltsvery
clean
and
quaffable
mouthfeel
is
lightyet
sturdy
this
is
very
good
and
very
drinkable
this
is
like
the
sarah
palin
of
beers
straight
out
of
alaska
and
aged
well
thanks
for
the
bottle
paul
a
bit
more
agressively
hopped
than
most
but
my
palate
really
enjoyed
the
agression
great
balance
throughout
but
with
that
citrusy
hop
assertiveness
all
the
way
nice
very
drinkable
tasty
beer
thanks
to
barleywinefiend
for
throwing
this
one
in
the
box

this
starts
to
make
up
for
the
extremely
shitty
can
of
bud
light
you
sent
me
starts
to
make
up
for
it
but
not
entirely
overall
the
beer
is
more
an
amber
style
instead
of
an
altbier
there
is
a
lack
of
hops
in
the
beer
its
an
ok
beer
d
good
drinkablity
but
a
little
to
syrupy
for
me
very
lighttasting
beer
clear
amber
color
with
moderate
head
aroma
of
flowers
and
malt
kind
of
like
sweet
bread
dough
tastes
malty
with
deifnite
fruitysweet
flavors
and
and
minor
hops
kind
of
a
wheaty
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
was
unexpected
from
an
amber
above
average
beer
d
this
is
very
tasty
and
very
sessionable
i
wish
i
had
more
it
could
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
newbies
d
nice
drinkability
woodsy
earthy
and
a
nice
beer
that
represents
its

from

for
ya
poured
with
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
tannish
head
nose
is
a

to
it

md
a

a
passable

nothing
great
very
easy
drinking
from
a
22

apples
with
some

is

fast
malty
toasty
some

and
evenly

medium

dry
but
just
sits
on
the
tongue
still
an
easy
drinking
beer
taste
is
well
balanced
though
slightly
tilted
toward
the
malts
nice
medium
bitter
finish
a
very
easy
drinker
the
abv
may
be
5
not
4
as
listed
it
certainly
feels
more
like
a
five
good
session
alt
if
you
dont
mind
the
sweetness
pours
a
redbrown
color
noncloudy
medium
sized
head
very
quickly
diminshing
an
aroma
of
hops
malt
sweet
flowers
good
smooth
nutty
taste
clean
finish
very
tasty
beer
ill
have
to
check
out
more
altbiers
if
this
is
representative
of
the
style
dont
know
about
the
alcohol
content
but
it
seems
fairly
strong
this
brew
pours
up
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
light
white
head
the
nose
consists
of
a
little
honey
also
malty
the
taste
is
dried
apple
peel
medium
bodied
spritzy
carbo
pretty
decent
brew
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
beer
much
better
than
i
last
remember
goes
down
easy
i
could
drink
on
this
all
night
dvery
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
sticking
out
on
this
one
that
sets
itself
apart
to
by
it
over
something
else
a
good
beer
appearance
has
a
light
brownish
amber
with
a
crisp
easily
dissapating
head
smell
is
grainy
sweet
malts
taste
of
light
malts
blends
to
make
a
slight
bitter
sweet
with
the
hops
slightly
grainy
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
slight
viscous
to
it
not
much
complexity
going
on
in
this
amber
but
it
does
make
for
a
good
session
drinkability
im
not
too
familiar
with
altbiers
but
tastes
like
a
spicier
amber
to
me
theres
a
slight
stinging
sensation
created
by
the
spices
and
carbonation
but
other
than
that
this
is
an
easy
drink
not
the
best
flavor
though
pours
a
light
amber
like
a
glass
of
iced
tea
the
head
is
slight
and
quick
to
die
the
aroma
is
thin
slightly
malty
but
only
slightly
the
flavor
is
decent
slightly
honeyish
but
vanishingly
slight
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
this
is
drinkable
but
hardly
an
outstanding
example
of
an
alt
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
does
not
dominate
the
palate
as
some
beers
can
d
this
beer
sort
of
goes
down
like
pop
its
very
smooth
but
i
think
that
the
sweetness
would
get
to
me
after
awhile
this
is
a
beer
with
appeal
to
to
nonbeer
drinkers
due
to
its
lack
of
hop
flavors
and
smoothness
my
grandparents
and
father
love
this
stuff
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
but
ill
continue
accepting
it
for
free
d
due
to
the
difficulty
of
brewing
an
alt
this
isnt
bad
however
they
need
to
reduce
the
hops
for
earthiness
and
color
and
add
more
grains
will
not
be
as
dry
d
yeah
its
drinkable
not
my
most
favorite
from
alaskan
brewing
but
it
is
still
not
too
bad
i
have
to
with
no
offense
intended
call
this
a
chick
beer
also
looks
like
a
vodka
cran
just
bothers
me
besides
anyone
who
knows
me
knows
i
take
my
vodka
cran
without
the
cran
probably
wont
be
revisiting
it
myself
but
ill
grab
a
bottle
now
and
then
in
case
i
need
help
getting
the
wife
in
the
mood
to
drink
beer
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
i
would
like
to
try
more
by
these
guys
if
i
get
a
chance
d
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
very
enjoyable
all
by
itself
complex
beer
that
becomes
more
so
as
you
drink
it
ive
never
been
to
alaska
but
would
like
to
however
this
beer
would
not
be
the
only
reason
i
visit
as
far
as
ambers
go
this
beer
is
totally
fine
the
appearance
is
spot
on
amber
caramely
sweetness
in
the
nose
and
leading
the
way
flavor
wise
as
well
mouthfeel
is
minimal
almost
like
water
yet
for
the
averageness
this
beer
is
totally
drinkable
and
not
offensive
at
all
this
could
easily
beer
paired
with
some
pizza
or
nachos
while
watching
tv
or
sitting
at
the
bar
with
friends
slight
recommendation
d
very
easy
drinking
easy
on
the
palate
not
too
boring
for
a
beer
with
amber
on
the
label
its
pretty
good
poured
a
light
amber
in
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
stuck
around
aroma
was
slight
cereal
grains
and
malty
sweetness
taste
was
a
little
bland
some
hops
and
malt
there
was
slight
bitterness
and
sweetness
to
it
it
has
a
decent
texture
but
it
is
a
little
light
i
feel
this
beer
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
never
really
enjoyed
it
i
would
rate
this
as
a
good
session
beer
for
some
but
for
me
it
is
not
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
though
ive
had
this
beer
on
tap
im
reviewing
the
bottled
version
both
variants
are
great
im
very
pleased
with
what
this
brew
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
other
ones
from
this
brewery
if
you
havent
had
it
i
suggest
that
you
at
least
attempt
to
try
it
once
on
tap
if
given
the
choice
everytime
i
try
this
beer
i
seem
to
like
it
more
and
more
it
has
a
good
texture
and
feel
in
the
mouth
it
is
tasty
and
refreshing
to
boot
much
better
than
their
summer
ale
kolsch
style
doesnt
the
beer
always
taste
better
when
you
visit
the
estabishment
where
its
brewed
while
in
juneau
i
stopped
by
and
had
a
few
brews
one
of
the
brews
was
there
amber
ale
the
color
when
poured
from
the
tap
was
a
deep
golden
amber
with
a
fair
amount
of
foam
that
dissapated
but
carried
a
fair
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
fruit
with
a
hint
of
spice
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
was
even
better
roasted
malts
with
a
complex
of
fruit
and
spices
like
i
said
being
there
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
evaluation
of
the
beer
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
theres
nothing
too
complex
going
on
but
it
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
had
at
the
1st
ever
stumelagram
tasting
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
aaages
honey
and
meaty
aromas
some
nice
looking
foam
and
head
action
a
simple
but
really
enjoyable
beer
pours
orange
a
very
people
friendly
altbier
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
next
d
it
has
a
refreshing
feel
to
it
so
it
would
be
suitable
for
a
hot
day
beer
or
an
i
want
to
get
drunk
session
slammer
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
seeking
it
out
drinkability
ehhh
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
maybe
a
bad
batch
its
interesting
but
remove
a
few
of
the
chemical
funk
notes
and
itd
be
a
lot
more
enjoyable
notes
enjoyable
stuff
but
not
something
id
reach
for
too
often
i
can
see
this
being
great
on
cask
however
from
a
bomber
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
nice
offwhite
head
and
lacing
caramel
and
some
nuts
and
vague
light
fruity
aromas
in
the
nose
taste
follows
suit
semisweet
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
creamy
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
bigger
than
the
abv
suggests
due
to
the
residual
sugars
and
offdry
finish
would
be
a
great
session
beer
if
it
was
a
bit
more
balanced
drinkability
is
the
strong
point
here
a
great
session
beer
candidate
tasty
and
light
in
abv
i
highly
recommend
this
one
would
have
liked
to
try
it
on
tap
but
time
was
limited
and
there
were
three
great
ipas
on
tap
on
my
few
beer
forays
and
also
alaskan
smoked
porter
drinkability
this
stuff
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
you
dont
have
to
think
about
but
you
can
theres
nothing
offensive
about
it
theres
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
i
find
this
beer
rather
sessionable
drinkability
is
this
beers
strong
suit
a
nice
tasty
beer
that
is
really
easy
to
drink
nothing
overly
special
just
a
good
session
brew
i
like
it
but
i
cant
say
id
drink
it
all
the
time
probably
good
with
some
spicy
brats
whole
grain
mustard
spatzel
etc
i
want
to
be
critical
take
away
from
the
amazing
accomplishment
but
im
lost
for
words
the
lightly
sweetened
bread
pudding
that
delicately
runs
over
my
taste
buds
has
me
ready
to
skip
dinner
and
dive
straight
into
dessert
the
head
is
weak
but
the
balanced
toasted
grain
is
so
goddam
yummy
this
beer
transports
me
to
a
long
harvest
table
decorated
with
rice
pudding
and
malty
sweet
pastry
breads
the
oily
sliver
seduces
me
and
im
hooked
this
is
by
far
the
hottest
grandma
in
the
woods
and
even
the
milf
hunters
must
turn
to
take
a
second
glance
im
in
love
with
an
altbier
and
she
makes
me
feel
so
so
good
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
browncopper
color
not
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
sweet
malty
smell
taste
is
very
malty
sweet
with
a
nutty
aftertaste
not
too
incredibly
complex
smooth
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
abv
a
pretty
tasty
average
beer
would
be
a
fine
choice
for
a
session
brew
i
brewed
a
clone
and
it
is
going
over
really
well
simple
session
beer
thats
clean
and
tasty
perfect
for
a
warm
day
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
with
decent
retention
smell
of
malts
grains
caramel
and
biscuits
lots
of
flavor
balanced
sweet
malty
taste
with
some
caramel
biscuits
and
some
hops
on
the
finish
well
balanced
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
malts
and
hops
nice
brew
creamy
and
rich
definitely
worth
a
try
the
body
is
between
light
and
moderate
very
impressed
with
how
clean
the
yeast
is
on
this
understandable
a
good
bjcp
candidate
and
very
refreshing
d
checking
out
the
alaskan
brewing
co
website
shows
this
is
classified
as
an
altbier
by
them
i
found
it
a
great
beer
to
have
with
dinner
id
consider
picking
up
another
sometime
caramel
malt
and
crispy
clean
finish
the
aftertaste
became
sweet
and
mouthwatering
a
really
good
brew
interesting
that
ba
has
it
listed
as
an
altbier
it
is
a
lot
smoother
and
mellow
with
more
malt
than
most
ambers
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
copper
colored
amber
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
sweet
biscuity
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
malt
that
has
nutty
and
biscuity
characteristics
with
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
bodied
overall
alaskan
amber
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
i
love
all
beer
and
given
a
choice
between
this
ale
and
iced
tea
would
pick
the
ale
any
day
of
the
week
but
this
is
not
by
a
long
shot
the
best
beer
i
have
had
alaskan
amber
might
also
get
some
bonus
points
because
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
first
awoke
me
out
of
macros
to
the
bigger
world
of
craft
beer
its
also
a
point
of
bonding
with
my
father
who
shares
a
deep
love
of
this
brew
but
enough
with
the
autobiography
i
think
this
is
good
stuff
easy
enough
to
drink
a
good
sitandwatchtv
beer
somewhat
drying
not
particularly
memorable
o
m
light
spice
balances
it
well
nice
malt
and
slight
yeasty
spice
dry
finish
light
to
med
mouthfeel
this
is
a
decent
sessionable
beer
nicely
balanced
with
just
a
few
flaws
its
worth
a
try
drank
pretty
easy
not
bad
but
i
actually
prefer
this
in
the
bottle
weird
d
very
awesome
beer
could
be
a
perfect
session
brew
id
wholeheartidly
recommend
this
to
anyone
if
i
ever
get
another
opportunity
to
try
this
i
wont
hesitate
m
mediumlight
body
very
smooth
the
taste
is
robust
for
such
a
small
beer
big
maltiness
dark
fruits
background
floral
hops
this
is
a
great
session
beer
funny
enough
its
probably
better
than
more
scores
reflect
just
because
its
just
so
all
purpose
its
not
going
to
blow
you
away
but
it
does
everything
really
well
a
pretty
good
amber
id
try
this
again
color
is
a
deep
orange
with
a
very
light
head
smelled
lightly
of
malt
tasted
of
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
near
the
end
nice
flavor
the
slightly
hoppy
bitter
finish
is
intriguing
enough
that
it
keeps
you
wanting
to
take
another
sip
very
very
drinkable
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
into
a
session
glass
the
beer
is
golden
orange
and
has
a
thin
head
which
dissipates
quickly
to
leave
a
lace
the
nose
is
initially
malty
some
spiciness
nutmeg
some
cabbage
in
the
background
the
taste
is
malt
forward
followed
be
an
unimpressive
watery
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
and
crisp
could
be
better
this
is
an
ok
session
brew
at
the
reef
in
point
roberts
there
is
one
lone
craft
tap
at
the
back
of
the
bar
and
it
is
alaskan
amber
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
west
coast
session
classic
seems
they
started
bringing
into
washington
state
early
on
in
the
craft
revolution
what
works
for
me
about
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
more
amber
than
alt
in
my
mind
the
malt
backbone
is
the
main
flavour
which
holds
the
beer
together
but
the
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
and
most
importantly
you
want
another
pint
right
after
like
fat
tire
or
full
sail
amber
this
is
a
food
friendly
drinking
beer
that
is
sold
almost
everywhere
in
the
pnwexpect
bc
alas
good
light
body
and
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
alaskan
brewing
always
does
a
good
job
a
great
session
beer
very
easy
to
drink
i
see
as
i
have
already
reached
the
bottom
of
my
glass
nothing
that
will
knock
you
socks
off
but
a
very
good
quality
beer
befitting
the
style
overall
nothing
too
exciting
but
this
is
a
well
made
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
brew
this
reminded
me
a
bit
of
fat
tire
but
better
22oz
bottle
that
was
amber
in
color
no
surprise
right
the
smell
was
a
very
nice
fruity
aroma
i
liked
it
the
taste
however
was
kinda
funky
and
departed
from
the
smell
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
but
i
am
going
to
have
to
drink
this
a
second
time
to
form
a
good
opinion
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
a
beer
which
i
could
easily
drink
several
bottles
of
md
thick
mouthfeel
that
washes
off
the
tongue
quickly
but
not
the
teeth
heavy
carbonation
is
a
detraction
meh
im
not
likely
to
try
this
one
again
drinkability
a
fine
easydrinking
session
beer
overall
i
tent
to
like
extreame
beers
this
beer
is
a
good
one
to
remind
me
that
there
are
other
great
beers
out
there
that
are
not
10
abv
with
130
ibus
great
beer
i
have
had
it
before
and
i
will
definately
have
it
again
thanks
to
fordest
for
this
one
pours
a
rich
orange
amber
color
with
a
some
nice
head
to
it
smell
is
nice
and
toasty
sweet
malt
and
toffee
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
tastes
is
good
and
heavily
on
the
malty
side
of
ambers
no
real
sign
of
hops
to
speak
of
but
it
is
a
nice
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
i
was
introduced
to
this
beer
by
my
brother
in
ak
and
cant
get
it
here
in
ne
but
i
can
in
wy
came
back
with
a
case
this
past
weekend
its
going
to
be
hard
to
make
it
stretch
out
the
flavor
has
a
nutty
toasted
grain
with
some
fading
fruit
quality
on
the
finish
a
simple
brew
that
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
its
goodwish
we
could
get
the
alaskan
beers
on
the
east
coast
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
chimay
chalice
thanks
nathan
for
this
one
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
2
inch
head
that
fades
away
quickly
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
aroma
is
malty
sweetness
up
front
but
then
the
fruits
come
out
bits
o
apple
and
citrus
come
out
in
the
nose
taste
is
mostly
malts
with
a
little
bready
yeasts
going
on
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
this
is
a
all
around
great
session
beer
ive
only
had
a
few
altbiers
over
the
years
and
the
notes
arent
good
enough
to
do
a
comparison
but
as
far
as
ambers
go
alaskan
amber
would
be
a
fantastic
session
and
a
great
gateway
beer
for
a
macrodrinker
wanting
to
expand
their
horizons
overall
i
should
give
these
more
chances
to
find
a
place
in
the
fridge
amber
is
the
staple
of
the
ak
brewing
co
it
is
a
qutie
average
altbier
it
pours
the
color
of
a
penny
with
good
head
and
malt
smell
it
starts
with
a
classic
altbier
taste
but
quickly
turns
malty
doesnt
have
the
creamy
fruitiness
of
an
amber
but
after
one
it
gets
much
more
drinkable
good
dark
malt
and
fruit
flavor
but
rather
grainy
and
almost
no
hop
flavors
present
the
bud
of
ak
drinkability
a
decent
session
beer
but
not
worth
seeking
out
could
use
a
little
bit
more
depth
of
character
and
less
cavity
forming
sugar
could
drink
several
of
these
especially
at
only
four
percent
alcohol
super
light
beer
that
goes
down
easier
than
most
out
there
another
good
beer
from
alaskan
i
needed
something
to
last
me
till
the
weekend
when
i
had
more
time
to
explore
la
beer
scene
alaskan
amber
was
my
choice
at
the
local
supermarket
ralphs
and
i
am
not
disappointed
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
drinkability
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
so
i
wanted
to
take
a
fresh
look
at
it
it
is
a
good
beer
it
is
not
my
favorite
alaskan
brewing
company
product
but
it
is
a
worthy
member
of
their
family
it
is
one
of
their
bestknown
and
best
selling
products
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
well
you
guessed
it
amber
a
full
amber
at
that
a
thinner
off
white
head
atopvery
nice
clarity
to
the
pour
lighter
malt
aromas
like
that
of
cookie
dough
with
notes
of
caramel
as
well
almost
no
hop
really
to
speak
of
except
for
a
drifting
leaf
presence
but
you
have
to
try
to
find
it
mild
malt
flavors
as
well
sweetish
cookie
dough
with
some
caramel
sweetness
a
touch
of
crispness
in
the
finish
keeps
it
from
being
to
sweet
a
no
frills
old
school
beer
lightly
sweet
low
in
alc
to
make
it
very
drinkable
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
although
i
prefer
it
on
tap
i
am
defiantly
not
disappointed
with
it
in
bottles
this
is
a
beer
i
almost
always
have
on
hand
good
brew
d
i
dont
know
about
this
one
it
seemed
to
make
me
thirsty
for
something
else
this
was
a
rather
drinkable
beer
i
normally
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
and
this
one
was
no
exception
there
are
others
who
do
this
beer
better
but
overall
this
is
a
solid
choice
comment
this
used
to
be
my
standard
bar
beerit
is
a
solid
choice
but
after
several
sessions
it
fell
into
disfavor
drinkability
good
the
alaskan
amber
pours
you
got
it
an
amber
color
with
little
head
to
it
the
smell
is
faint
tinge
of
grain
the
taste
is
a
mellow
and
it
has
a
balance
to
it
between
the
hops
and
malt
it
is
light
on
the
carbonation
and
the
feeling
on
the
palate
is
soft
and
a
little
floral
in
the
finish
this
would
be
a
hot
summer
day
beer
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbo
is
medium
its
pretty
drinkable
and
somewhat
sessionable
considering
that
its
only
4abv
but
doesnt
stand
out
as
very
exciting
d
this
is
one
i
havent
had
in
a
long
time
went
back
to
it
and
im
glad
i
did
a
good
simple
ale
and
inexpensive
to
boot
a
nice
amber
the
color
is
actually
a
pleasant
ruby
shade
very
appealing
the
nose
carries
a
faint
indistinct
trace
of
hops
beneath
a
big
sweet
maltiness
caramel
or
biscuit
flavor
had
a
bit
of
roastiness
along
the
lines
of
a
stout
suggesting
some
roasted
barley
in
all
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
accompany
my
steak
at
the
dam
bar
and
grill
in
page
arizona
drinkability
not
bad
for
the
apparent
altbier
classification
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
of
the
classic
amber
ale
has
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
that
i
did
really
enjoy
and
would
probably
be
more
enjoyable
with
food
than
sitting
watching
a
baseball
game
smells
of
grain
and
bready
malts
tastes
malty
and
has
a
slight
fruity
sweetness
to
it
very
balanced
taste
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
very
smooth
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
it
were
offered
to
me
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
it
again
the
taste
has
an
enjoyable
malty
presence
with
some
notes
of
pear
plum
and
raisin
some
hop
shows
up
to
balance
out
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
with
a
wellcarbonated
body
and
a
smooth
lingering
caramelmalt
finish
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
especially
with
such
a
low
abv
its
tasty
moderately
complex
and
nicely
balanced
so
id
be
willing
to
have
it
again
a
light
browncopper
color
with
a
whispy
head
and
little
sign
of
lacing
a
malty
smell
with
highlights
of
vanilla
and
carmel
even
a
little
pineapple
this
particular
pour
seemed
a
tad
flat
definitely
undercarbonated
but
the
flavor
hangs
in
with
the
slightly
sweet
nutty
goodness
malt
and
carmel
hold
but
this
one
does
disappoint
in
its
lack
of
carbonation
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
perhaps
fresher
to
do
better
justice
to
its
potential
drinkable
enough
but
not
lively
enough
here
promising
o
a
decent
amber
ale
with
a
small
abv
and
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
has
a
copper
colored
appearance
with
a
relatively
small
head
which
eventually
laced
away
the
main
aroma
consisted
of
malt
and
that
dominated
the
palate
too
this
was
followed
by
toffee
and
slight
nuttiness
this
beer
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
was
also
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
creamy
head
fed
by
a
lazy
progression
of
tiny
bubbles
drifting
up
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
to
tickle
your
nose
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
malt
with
oak
flavors
and
a
sour
finish
it
has
a
nutty
taste
that
makes
me
happy
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
as
smooth
as
the
head
promises
the
drinkability
is
great
ive
got
easy
access
to
it
for
the
next
10
days
while
im
in
alasks
and
i
plan
to
take
full
advantage
this
is
a
pretty
straightforward
yet
enjoyable
beer
copper
to
orange
in
appearance
its
a
bit
bready
with
some
sweet
dough
and
toffee
the
flavors
make
way
for
some
notes
of
caramel
as
you
would
expect
its
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
overbearing
at
just
4
abv
it
makes
a
good
choice
if
youre
looking
to
drive
your
car
afterwards
dvery
high
i
can
completely
understand
why
this
would
be
a
very
popular
beer
100
middle
of
the
road
in
almost
all
categories
it
is
bland
enough
to
fit
in
with
the
light
beer
drinking
crowd
while
being
obscure
enough
to
give
it
some
street
cred
with
the
craft
beer
group
i
would
drink
this
all
day
long
hanging
out
with
my
friends
as
long
as
they
paid
for
it
it
is
just
too
plain
jane
to
spend
my
own
money
on
again
i
even
allowed
my
secoond
one
to
warm
a
bit
so
it
wasnt
ice
cold
but
i
detected
no
improvement
average
amber
d
nice

sort

boring

0
this
is
a
prime
session
candidate
a
nice
alternative
to
brown
or
amber
ales
sort
of
reminds
me
of
anchor
steam
in
a
way
thanks
to
bitterbill
for
including
this
one
that
ive
been
wanting
to
try
for
too
long
toasty
grain
aroma
with
a
citrus
hint
tastes
biscuity
and
starch
in
mouth
with
a
possible
cherry
note
at
the
end
starts
promising
but
dissapoints
going
down
the
throat
quite
plain
and
bland
however
still
quite
drinkable
in
my
opinion
but
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
in
an
alt
poured
a
nice
clear
bright
but
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
that
had
a
nice
slow
fade
and
some
very
good
lacing
smell
was
nice
a
bit
lit
ful
of
grain
and
bread
tastes
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
a
slight
bitter
hop
trying
to
work
its
way
into
the
back
overall
not
bad
the
taste
was
very
full
lots
of
malt
flavors
with
a
hint
at
a
nice
slightly
hopped
back
a
very
good
session
beer
and
a
fine
offering
from
alaskan
brewing
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
ambers
generally
but
this
was
rather
nice
i
could
see
myself
putting
down
several
of
these
with
ease
a
very
good
call
overall
on
par
for
an
average
amber
ale
cereals
and
grains
with
some
light
fruitiness
i
would
have
liked
to
see
some
more
citrus
character
from
the
hops
when
i
think
of
an
altbier
i
think
of
something
with
a
little
more
complexity
a
yawner
d
this
beer
is
only
4
the
malts
make
me
think
of
a
strong
ale
that
is
twice
as
strong
this
is
a
big
chewy
drink
that
rightfully
is
alaskans
flagship
ale
poured
to
a
dark
copper
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
aroma
was
a
very
pleasant
blend
of
malty
dark
fruit
peat
and
a
hint
of
smokey
wood
flavor
was
not
quite
as
pronounced
although
more
of
the
same
mouthfeel
was
slightly
sweet
and
rich
and
finish
long
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
i
could
not
drink
many
of
these
at
once
but
a
good
tasting
sipping
beer
di
enjoyed
it
and
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
but
it
is
the
polar
opposite
from
what
an
alt
should
taste
like
the
yeast
used
contributed
too
many
esters
it
also
lacked
munich
malt
flavor
and
a
clean
lager
characteristic
mahoganycoulour
with
a
minimal
head
raisins
cherries
dominate
the
smell
with
an
almost
pumpernickle
like
malt
aroma
almosta
portlike
taste
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
better
than
the
typical
amber
ale
especially
considering
the
elow
sweet
aftertaste
minimal
hops
tasty
the
mouthfeel
almost
stings
though
good
body
wierd
carbonation
interesting
beer
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
a
wonderful
dark
copper
tone
with
a
tan
color
to
the
head
which
was
small
due
to
the
pour
but
still
tan
nonetheless
a
lovely
doughy
caramel
and
sweet
malt
scent
wafted
from
the
glass
going
down
the
beer
had
a
great
and
wonderfully
drinkable
creamy
character
to
it
sweet
malt
and
caramel
also
took
the
show
in
the
flavor
department
nothing
too
exotic
but
this
brew
made
for
a
delightful
experience
that
paired
well
with
both
an
irish
style
meat
bread
and
cheese
platter
and
the
fish
and
chips
basket
that
followed
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
before
when
had
on
its
own
but
taking
a
critical
look
its
average
at
best
for
a
craft
beer
and
mediocre
by
the
usually
very
high
standards
of
alaskan
appearance
was
a
brilliant
redbrown
with
great
amounts
of
white
head
with
good
staying
power
aroma
was
malty
and
a
bit
reminiscent
to
me
of
the
way
a
bock
smells
flavor
was
also
bock
malt
flavor
with
lots
of
unexpected
chocolate
taste
mouthfeel
was
good
but
almost
coarse
and
chalky
which
seemed
to
help
rub
the
chocolate
taste
into
my
taste
buds
i
found
this
beer
to
be
highly
drinkable
a
very
drinkable
beer
particularly
since
abv
is
low
but
nothing
spectacular
or
particularly
complex
if
you
are
wondering
how
a
guy
from
massachusetts
gets
a
beer
from
alaska
ill
tell
you
a
friend
from
albany
new
york
gets
this
beer
shipped
from
alaska
and
i
happened
onto
a
few
and
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
that
you
cannot
get
in
massachusetts
its
not
a
bad
beer
ill
certainly
drink
it
again
like
a
lot
of
the
larger
craft
brews
it
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
i
just
dont
think
itll
be
my
first
choice
on
the
beer
list
overall
a
very
nice
malty
beer
but
well
attenuated
and
balanced
cant
believe
it
is
only
4
abv
but
if
so
it
packs
a
wallop
of
flavor
into
such
a
small
package
what
an
interesting
beer
i
love
a
beer
that
doesnt
fall
into
a
category
easily
ive
had
some
altbiers
enough
to
know
that
this
settles
grudgingly
into
that
style
however
to
me
it
seems
to
have
some
slipperiness
around
its
style
edges
its
mouthfeel
is
slick
but
also
chewy
full
and
buttery
yet
the
middle
of
the
beer
is
brassy
and
slightly
sour
lacing
is
sparse
head
does
not
last
long
and
only
a
skim
remains
but
a
great
deal
of
taste
for
a
beer
of
so
low
abv
recommended
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
am
enjoying
quaffing
this
one
watching
college
gameday
on
espn
a
fine
mixture
of
satisfying
flavor
and
a
very
modest
abv
make
for
a
tremendously
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
overall
a
good
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
that
id
buy
very
often
drank
it
on
its
own
i
think
itd
probably
be
much
better
served
with
food
a
very
enjoyable
beer
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
the
light
body
and
full
taste
of
this
beer
make
it
a
new
favorite
as
a
session
beer
heartily
recommended
it
was
a
clear
red
amber
color
with
thin
tan
head
lacing
stayed
for
the
whole
beer
also
the
nose
was
filled
with
sweeter
malts
and
was
hard
to
distinguish
other
smells
it
was
a
sweet
beer
with
very
light
bitter
aftertatse
had
the
taste
of
caramel
in
it
also
pretty
laid
back
malts
and
not
much
else
was
smooth
and
crisp
not
much
was
going
on
in
it
after
being
restricted
to
midwest
beers
lived
in
in
for
23
years
and
3
drinking
years
this
is
still
a
treat
to
me
a
good
fallback
and
a
cheap
grocery
store
pickup
the
smell
is
mostly
of
caramel
with
a
bit
of
esters
the
taste
starts
with
caramel
and
malt
moves
to
a
notable
hop
presence
and
ends
with
grains
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
pleasing
while
drinkability
is
good
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
lacing
around
the
rim
a
caramel
malt
smell
with
a
light
sweet
floral
sent
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
toasted
malts
and
caramel
with
a
slight
hops
spice
and
a
sweet
finish
the
feel
is
crisp
and
has
a
light
finish
in
all
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
its
a
light
amber
beer
with
a
clean
taste
and
finish
its
flavors
are
not
over
powering
its
not
a
wonderful
beer
but
is
has
good
qualities
it
is
very
drinkable
and
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
stuff
while
its
still
on
sale
alaskan
has
named
this

but
labeled
it
as

which
gave
way
in
the
finish
to
a
mild
slightly
earthy
bitterness
these
flavours
were
nicely
balanced
and
all
lingered
on
as
a
pleasant
aftertaste
relatively
light
bodied
for
a
beer
this
dark
and
with
a
fine
carbonation
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
bit
thin
for
my
personal
taste
overall
though
this
fairly
uncommon
style
of
beer
is
probably
the
best
of
creemores
offerings
and
certainly
worth
a
try
at
2

slight

light

decent

pretty
good
pleasant
to
drink
overall
good
a
nice
minor
variation
on
standard
creemore
though
not
as
nice
as
their
kellerbier
an
okay
beer
but
pretty
lacking
in
complexity
and
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
first
altbier
ive
tried
happens
to
be
pretty
tasty
and
look
forward
to
trying
others
in
a
similar
style
o
this
was
a
nice
easy
drinker
thanks
again
matt
i
look
forward
to
the
day
when
a
glass
of
altbier
is
as
popular
as
a
latte
and
traditional
brewhouses
are
as
plentiful
as
starbucks
thats
the
norm
in
germany
though
it
is
still
a
long
way
off
here
in
canada
creemore
springs
altbier
however
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
heres
hoping
more
breweries
follow
can
poured
a
clear
brown
color
alt
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
alight
lacing
aroma
of
dry
caramel
malt
with
chewy
biscuit
malt
is
quite
great
taste
is
a
great
mix
between
some
dry
caramel
malt
with
light
roasted
nuts
and
chewy
gain
body
is
about
average
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
bang
on
to
style
great
drinkability
and
very
enjoyable
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
creemore
i
like
the
urbock
better
still
a
highly
drinkable
beer
nonetheless
final
thoughts
i
dont
think
altbier
is
my
cup
of
tea
as
with
my
love
for
english
brown
ales
my
preference
for
brown
beer
is
malt
over
nuttiness
and
certainly
over
dryness
if
you
like
a
dry
beer
but
dont
like
the
high
bitterness
of
excessive
hops
this
beer
is
for
you
i
hate
to
say
it
but
its
my
first
disappointment
from
creemore
springs
but
i
cant
really
hold
it
against
them
as
at
the
very
least
they
continue
to
push
the
envelope
by
brewing
this
under
represented
style
o
this
is
an
amazing
collaboration
beer
and
a
great
beer
the
germans
should
be
proud
that
canadians
have
brewed
a
great
altbier
overall
resin
flavour
begins
to
dominate
over
time
but
that
prevents
it
from
getting
tired
dry
rustic
flavour
is
great
but
too
light
overall
a
highly
unimpressive
beer
leaves
a
malty
aftertaste
and
drinks
like
a
macro
seeing
as
its
molson
owned
disapointed
let
down
a
hoppy
altbier
sure
why
the
hell
not
and
thankfully
not
very
adherent
to
west
coast
standards
in
that
regard
anyway
a
decent
balanced
tipple
and
a
nice
sideshow
for
this
brewery
very
helpful
in
showing
we
far
flung

that
they
havent
lost

creemore
have
stuck
to
their
roots
making
europeaninspired
beers
while
doing
something
fairly
different
for
the
ontario
market
theyve
also
made
a
delicious
beer

d
very
easy

dry

good

sipper
unlikely
to
find
this
on
the

o
pretty
good

a

drinkable
beer
i
feel
like
this
would
pair
nicely
with
a
rich
pasta
dish
im
interested
to
try
another
altbier
would
definitely
purchase
again

an

creemore

altbier
makes
for
yet
another
fantastic
offering
to
add
to
their
portfolio
despite
their
acquisition
by
one
of
the
nations
macro
giants
this
brewery
keeps
chugging
along
and
producing
some
of
ontarios
most
widelyavailable
consistently
solid
beer
this
is
well
worth
adding
to
their
seasonal
lineup
assuming
it
doesnt
displace
their
also
excellent
kellerbier
this
is
a
great
summerautumn
refresher
that
is
well
worth
sampling
despite
being
the
first
ale
from
creemore
springs
brewery
limited
this
altbier
has
a
familiarity
the
brewerys
fans
will
appreciate
for
my
taste
it
could
use
a
bit
more
of
a
malt
punch
to
balance
the
bitterness
but
this
is
a
very
solid
effort
that
i
will
be
sure
to
try
again
while
its
available
o
its
nice
to
see
something
new
coming
out
of
creemore
they
do
things
well
and
arent
ones
to
push
boundaries
or
experiment
and
i
enjoy
the
subtleties
of
their
beers
overall
pretty
decent
i
guess
but
nothing
exciting
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
an
altbier
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
with
style
wise
its
worth
trying
but
id
have
one
of
their
other
varieties
before
this

next

i
enjoyed
the
extra

in
this
one
and
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
brews
for
a
style
im
not
crazy
about
another
good
brew
from
creemore
certainly
a
great
project
for
their
anniversary
year
as
a
kw
resident
i
really
hope
this
brew
makes
it
to
some
of
the
oktoberfest
events
as
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
again
and
again
easydrinking
wellmade
traditional
altbier
good
flavour
and

malts
tend
to
dominate
the

a
bit
i
find
but
it
works
together
not
a
common
style
to
come
across
in
ontario
so
a
solid
effort
that
is
worth
trying
brown
in

with
a

has
earthy

bready

hop

altbier
not
exactly
what
i
expected
from
the
style
yet
a
very
drinkable
and
reasonably
tasty
beer
some
ace
slightly
amber
colour
average
mouthfeel
me
thinks
this
will
be
a
hit
collaboration
with
zum
schlussel
reputed
the
greatest
alt
brewers
good
drinkability
in
the
can
as
well
nothing
special
here
maybe
this
bottle
is
a
bit
past
its
prime
expires
in
two
months
but
i
dont
see
this
being
much
better
fresh
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
that
was
pretty
thin
the
aromas
were
of
a
lot
of
grains
and
malt
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
hops
on
the
nose
or
much
else
perhaps
a
little
spice
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
mostly
dry
malt
some
fresh
leaves
some
other
flavors
of
nature
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
its
drinkable
and
worth
trying
again
i
was
better
than
i
expected
a
dark
but
clear
rosey
mahogany
color
with
an
offwhitegrey
whimpy
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
with
modest
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
maltyroot
brown
sugar
and
sour
mash
the
flavor
is
sour
malt
and
weak
wheat
grain
goodness
but
its
quite
thin
and
watery
minimal
carbonation
a
bit
tingly
drinkable
but
not
desirable
particularly
i
cant
really
pick
up
any
other
qualities
just
kind
of
nondescript
not
one
i
will
revisit
this
was
my
first
alt
beer
that
i
remember
ive
had
others
since
but
i
figured
id
review
this
one
first

medium
body
at
best
with
a
rather
astringent
mouthfeel
an
easy
drinker
with
the
mild
alcohol
not
really
noticeable
except
in
the
nose
worth
a
try
for
the
style
and
a
nice
reuseable
bottle
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
medium
tan
head
lots
of
caramel
and
bread
in
the
aroma
flavor
was
dense
with
caramel
and
malt
with
a
bitter
end
no
hops
mostly
sour
apple
some
fruitiness
with
a
heavier
than
expected
mouthfeel
its
okay
but
not
worth
doing
again
appearance
is
crystal
clear
deep
chocolate
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
and
a
rocky
offwhite
head
that
lingers
for
only
a
moment
or
two
to
settle
in
a
thin
layer
aroma
has
bready
malts
with
notes
of
milk
chocolate
and
bread
dough
along
with
some
faint
flowery
noble
hops
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
it
took
me
nearly
the
whole
glass
to
nail
down
all
the
flavors
up
front
im
hit
with
sweet
chocolate
and
bread
dough
through
the
middle
i
taste
those
flowery
noble
hops
and
hazelnut
then
in
the
finish
is
a
distinct
sherrylike
note
medium
to
medium
low
mouthfeel
makes
this
highly
drinkable
and
the
restrained
carbonation
compared
to
most
other
german
lagers
i
think
really
helped
bring
out
the
robust
flavors
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
im
upset
i
didnt
pick
up
more
bottles
oh
well
i
guess
ill
have
to
buy
more
d
overall
a
good
drinking
and
hoppy
alt
with
rich
ripe
fruit
makes
this
and
enjoyable
experience
that
was
rich
and
fruity
and
smooth
going
down
i
bought
this
in
a
0
5
liter
bottle
that
had
a
resealable
top
like
grolsch
it
pours
with
very
little
head
which
went
away
quickly
with
no
lacing
very
dark
brown
it
has
a
nutty
smell
with
hints
of
sweetness
and
the
taste
is
similar
with
malt
medium
carbonation
this
is
my
first
try
with
an
altbier
so
i
have
no
others
to
compare
it
to
i
do
like
it
even
though
it
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
my
taste
drinkability
works
for
me
not
too
heavy
not
too
much
alcohol
content
good
taste
not
much
can
go
wrong
with
a
couple
of
these
this
is
a
pretty
delicate
beer
with
light
flavors
and
aromas
but
its
pretty
good
there
is
something
to
be
appreciated
about
that
very
recommended
appearance
is
deceiving
it
looks
a
lot
heavier
than
it
really
is
the
color
of
cherry
coke
with
a
thin
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
into
an
even
lacing
it
has
a
very
subtle
aroma
similar
to
that
of
a
traditional
scottish
amber
but
with
more
of
a
sweetness
its
a
fullbodied
taste
that
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
has
a
relatively
mild
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
watery
mouthfeel
not
quite
enough
uumph
for
my
personal
preference
but
i
certainly
cant
put
it
down
this
is
a
genuine
beerdrinkers
beer
light
in
body
and
fairly
thin
on
the
tongue
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
lacks
a
bit
in
flavor
but
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
good
session
beer
that
wont
get
in
the
way
drinkability
very
good
great
smooth
taste
and
easy
to
drink
would
make
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
im
on
the
fence
with
this
one
it
started
off
nice
with
the
appearance
and
unique
aroma
but
it
finished
off
rather
weak
it
wasnt
all
that
hoppy
and
it
wasnt
all
that
unique
drinkability
worth
a
try
but
it
aint
great
pours
a
dark
brownish
amber
color
with
a
nice
lace
of
head
smell
has
fruity
and
malty
aromas
taste
is
fruity
but
very
complex
also
its
lightly
carbonated
and
goes
down
extra
smooth
with
a
slight
bitterness
towards
the
end
the
hops
and
malts
are
perfectly
balance
the
is
one
fine
brew
and
i
cant
imagine
and
altbier
getting
much
better
than
this
a
great
example
of
an
often
negleted
style
personally
i
think
this
is
schwelmers
best
offering
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
mahoganny
color
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
sweet
at
first
then
i
thought
a
little
skunky
possibly
the
taste
at
first
was
watery
but
then
i
came
to
tase
a
little
nuttiness
maply
spicey
taste
i
first
said
no
then
changed
my
mind
to
yes
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
kind
of
a
wishy
washy
reveiw
but
this
beer
got
better
as
i
drank
on
it
a
deep
mohagany
beer
with
a
thin
head
and
the
aroma
of
rich
malt
and
slight
sweetness
of
molasses
taste
is
rich
but
not
overdone
with
the
malt
having
the
right
amount
of
hop
and
good
carbonation
to
give
it
a
clean
bite
having
a
medium
mouthfeel
i
got
to
say
that
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
wish
i
had
another
to
chase
it
darkish
brown
with
mild
yeasty
and
malty
aroma
taste
like
a
subdued
barleywinea
bit
of
a
season
and
an
understated
maudite
nuttiness
herbal
and
creamy
carmel
easy
drinking
nothing
bold
and
exciting
but
a
fine
brew
well
carbonated
with
no
significant
head
its
a
good
beer
and
i
am
a
scotch
fan
and
like
the
taste
but
like
i
said
above
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
not
an
everyday
beer

i
get
the
tobacco
notes

a

review
very
smooth
with
maltiness
balanced
by
slight
hops
enjoyable
brew
in
a
style
i
loved
in
germany
and
very
hard
to
find
locally
this
is
fine
and
delicate
altbier
do
not
expect
the
hop
level
in
this
guy
to
match
an
american
double
ipa
or
anything
instead
approach
this
like
you
would
a
piece
of
antique
furniture
the
more
you
allow
this
one
to
grow
on
your
palate
the
more
it
appreciates
in
value
would
make
a
fantastic
session
beer
in
some
dark
hiddenaway
german
bar
might
go
great
with
dumplings
or
struedel
overall
a
tasty
beer

im
not

i
am
totally
getting
the
style
since
i
dont
encounter
it
often
enough
but
i
thought
this
example
was
generally
boring
despite
the
disappointment
it
does
have
a
certain
smoothness
especially
as
it
warms
that
gives
it
a
certain
drinkability
for
the
one
bottle
but
wouldnt
rush
for
more
well
i
wasnt
crazy
about
the
bernstein
which
this
has
a

similarity
too
and
this
was
even
blander
i
would
stick
with
the
weizen

the
three
offerings
ive
had
from

overall

alt

expected

beer
really
moderate
malt
aroma
slight
caramel
smell
to
it
malty
flavor
with
a
decent
nutty
flavor
there
is
a
whisper
of
smokiness
in
it
for
me
good
mouthfeel
very
good
beer
i
could
see
drinking
bucketloads
of
this
on
a
nice
sunny
day
as
beautiful
a
color
as
ive
seen
in
a
beer
head
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
it
but
my
god
what
a
color
deep
dark
mahogany
visible
through
the
small
amount
of
light
that
permeates
smell
of
toasy
malt
and
light
hops
hallertau
is
at
work
here
and
doing
a
real
nice
job
taste
is
just
a
little
smoky
in
addition
to
the
aformentioned
characteristics
from
the
nose
this
with
a
nice
hop
finish
mouthfeel
though
velvety
is
a
touch
sticky
still
the
verdict
here
is
two
thumbs
way
up
10
bucks
a
sixer
is
a
little
crazy
but
youre
paying
for
that
fine
packaging
and
the
cool
bottles
would
love
it
if
more
american
micros
would
enter
the
ring
with
this
style
dthis
could
be
a
good
session
ale
but
i
think
i
would
have
to
switch
after
about
2
or
3
the
drinkability
is
good
and
easy
just
dont
expect
a
lot
of
body
prosit
mk
not
the
most
complex
of
beers
but
the
nice
roast
and
hops
together
with
the
high
drinkability
make
this
a
nice
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
alt
beer
and
one
that
is
worth
a
try
drinks
fairly
easy
but
like
my
alts
a
little
more
beefier
on
the
malt
hops
side
give
me
a
diebels
any
day
so
far
this
brewery
aint
really
floating
my
boat
this
beer
simply
blows
me
away
and
ill
be
sure
to
revisit
it
next
time
pulled
pork
is
on
my
entertainment
menu
one
of
my
favorites
probably
my
favorite
session
beer
behind
anchor
steam
beer
all
of
the
flavors
are
mellow
and
supremely
well
balanced
and
the
overall
palate
is
exceedingly
drinkable
this
one
is
a
classic
the
alt
poured
a
cola
like
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
head
was
decent
nothing
special
but
left
very
nice
lacing
it
has
a
malt
sweetness
to
it
caramel
toasted
the
taste
is
of
caramel
malts
a
bit
nutty
a
bit
dark
fruit
a
nice
fizzy
mouthfeel
crisp
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
am
not
very
familar
with
the
style
but
i
like
it
d
great
very
similar
to
a
brown
or
nutbrown
ale
but
with
some
very
odd
qualities
smooth
and
easydrinking

which
doesnt
make
any
sense
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
it
opens
with
a
loud
pop
and
pours
a
chestnut
hue
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
toasted
and
caramel
malts
fruits
paper
and
some
sweetness
that
is
a
bit
too
prevalent
it
tastes
essentially
the
same
with
spicy
leafy
and
freshlycuthay
hops
that
leave
a
mild
bitterness
on
top
of
a
light
body
that
leaves
light
finish
overall
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
that
great
balanced
yes
but
they
need
to
beef
up
the
both
the
malts
and
hops
drinkability
is
nice
its
a
representative
example
of
the
the
style
enjoyed
it
drinkability
ive
yet
to
be
impressed
by
an
altbier
but
this
one
is
okay
and
fairly
drinkable
i
might
have
been
a
little
disappointed
if
it
werent
so
cheap
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
brew
for
sure
the
flavors
are
very
mellow
but
interesting
and
tasty
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
style
so
i
was
happy
to
try
it
out
overall
i
found
it
to
be
a
nice
beer
slightly
smoky
in
smell
balanced
as
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
crisp
in
my
mouth
and
it
leaves
a
pleasent
lingering
flavor
easy
to
drink
i
would
buy
it
again
pours
dark
almost
like
a
coke
with
a
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
ring
of
lacing
on
the
glass
i
looked
at
the
label
unique
hoppy
altbier
and
thought
the
hops
were
gonna
rip
my
tongue
off
or
something
not
so
to
find
the
truth
turn
the
bottle
around
simply
water
malt
hops
simple
things
are
good
though
it
has
a
sweet
caramel
malt
nose
with
a
bit
of
hmmm
is
it
fruit
or
chocolate
it
is
kinda
hard
to
tell
after
inhaling
concrete
dust
today
now
for
the
taste
nice
and
malty
in
the
front
with
a
hint
of
hops
taking
over
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
pardon
me
while
i
have
another
skoal
opinion
i
really
like
this
beer
and
am
rather
glad
that
it
doesnt
have
the
hoppy
bite
that
i
thought
it
may
from
the
label
this
beer
comes
across
a
bit
like
a
dunkel
and
i
am
hard
pressed
to
pick
up
the
alt
character
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
would
certainly
drink
it
any
time
that
i
get
the
chance
i
would
just
not
expect
an
alt
but
a
well
crafted
dark
beer
hey
its
always
a
decent
weekend
when
you
score
big
on
news
brews
this
alt
is
new
to
me
and
yet
it
already
seems
like
a
longtime
friend
already
after
a
couple
of
bottles
talk
about
nice
dar
reddish
brown
nice
sticky
head
sweet
malty
backbone
that
is
almost
nutty
but
certainly
bready
it
finishes
nice
with
a
pperfect
mix
of
hops
the
more
i
drink
altbiers
the
more
i
like
them
but
this
is
definitely
a
great
alt
that
should
be
enjoyed
by
everyone
has
a
nice
deep
ruby
medium
clear
brown
but
no
bublles
and
no
head
only
a
16th
of
an
inch
after
the
pour
the
first
snikks
are
very
acidty
and
battery
head
liek
but
they
bring
some
darker
malts
to
the
nose
a
little
the
taste
jas
some
stale
malts
but
a
good
yet
light
bitterness
beer
is
good
happy
altbeering
corked
bottle
opens
with
a
big
pop
good
start
and
an
aroma
of
malty
chocolate
pours
to
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
red
thick
tan
head
that
lingers
awhile
and
decent
lacing
unfortunately
the
beer
goes
downhill
after
this
flavor
is
okay
more
malt
and
hint
of
chocolate
but
a
very
thin
body
and
watery
finish
makes
this
a
less
enjoyable

the

dont

it
i

i
will

this

poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
formed
a
nice
2

that
was

in
color
the
beer
itself
was
a
dark
brown
with
traces
of
red
when
held
to
the
light
medium
body
not
hoppy
at
all
although
it
describes
itself
as
hoppy
on
the
label
well
balanced
bread
like
nose
with
floral
hints
very
easy
to
drink
not
at
all
like
traditional
alts
from
dusseldorf
but
still
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
highly
recomended
for
the
altbier
style
this
is
a
good
beer
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
its
quite
refreshing
this
may
be
a
bit
too
strong
to
be
what
the
bros
would
define
as
a
session
beer
but
i
would
say
its
as
close
to
a
great

5this
duesseldorf
style
altbier
has
been
my
favorite
alt
for
years
while
living
in
germany
in
comparison
to
many
other
alts
this
one
is
slightly
sweeter
and
smoother
than
for
example
a
diebels
alt
from
dusseldorf
now
in
its
new
fliptopbottle
this
beer
is
real
gemdasa1044nov
21
its
lighter
in
body
that
expected
though
it
actually
fits
fairly
well
and
isnt
watery
or
overly
thin
it
does
lean
a
little
too
much
in
that
direction
but
not
heinously
so
its
definitely
crisp
with
a
fair
smoothness
off
of
even
carbonation
o
nice
amber
that
goes
down
easy
good
for
a
few
overall
not
my
style
just
tasted
unadventurous
a
solid
malt
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
hops
or
bitterness
too
pricey
for
me
to
drink
when
im
not
all
that
high
on
it
to
begin
with
the
key
to
this
one
is
freshness
if
you
can
find
it
somewhere
still
in
the
box
try
it
out
otherwise
its
spoilled
and
hard
to
enjoy
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
sticky
white
head
toasted
grain
rules
the
nose
the
taste
more
or
less
follows
along
with
a
pleasently
bitter
after
taste
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
solid
all
around
brew
i
found
this
in
the
beer
fridge
at
my
brotherinlaw
and
sisterinlaws
house
i
figured
i
would
pop
the
top
and
take
some
notes
it
is
an
amber
or
light
brown
color
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
the
highlight
of
this
beer
with
some
nutty
malt
tones
the
attack
is
initially
clean
and
then
the
flavor
follows
like
a
mouthful
of
straw
it
instantly
made
me
think
of
a
beer
i
had
some
years
ago
before
i
started
reviewing
called
bitburger
some
people
like
it
but
i
remember
it
for
how
much
i
did
not
grolsch
amber
ale
conjured
memories
of
that
long
ago
brew
the
tones
and
flavors
in
this
grolsch
amber
are
nutty
and
strawlike
a
decent
if
boring
lawnmower
beer
ugh
not
much
ale
more
american
macro
lager
kind
of
flat
while
it
is
better
than
most
lager
when
youre
expecting
an
ale
this
was
disappointing
conclusion
this
is
a
simple
but
quite
tasty
amber
ale
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
high
drinkability
this
beer
poured
with
a
generous
head
and
a
deep
amber
color
the
aroma
is
light
caramel
maltiness
balanced
by
a
touch
of
hops
medium
bodied
with
good
drinkability
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
smell
very
nicely
balanced
this
is

i
like
the
clear
bottle
in
that
you
can
really
see
the
filtered
contents
within
but
as
there
was
no
age
date
ya
gotta
wonder
how
fresh
or
old
this
beer
is
by
the
time
it
reaches
your
tastebuds
but
i
like
it
and
will
drink
it
periodically
throughout
the
year
a
fine
session
beer
finished
the
third
bfore
i
tried
to
review
it
purely
an
accident
i
assure
you
drinkability
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
no
issues
it
tastes
fine
smells
fine
and
goes
down
well
i
probably
wouldnt
reach
for
many
though
its
not
the
type
of
beer
i
see
as
having
more
than
2
of
im
used
to
just
seeing
swingtop
green
bottles
of
grolsch
euro
lager
on
store
shelves
so
to
see
this
clearbottled
beauty
was
a
rare
treat
not
the
best
beer
to
have
all
night
but
it
probably
wont
steer
you
wrong
d
too
sweet
to
me
this
tasted
like
a
sweeter
newcastle
with
a
hint
of
hops
it
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
it
is
decidedly
average
d
decent
drinkability
could
have
a
couple
of
these
with
a
nice
dry
toasted
woodiness
and
equally
nice
flowery
hopping
makes
for
a
decent
example
though
the
mouthful
hinders
a
better
rating
not
a
bad
amber
from
grolsch
a
decent
session
beer
that
i
would
have
again
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
a
lighter
alt
in
body
with
a
decent
character
but
overall
lacks
in
richness
it
resembles
an
altflavored
red
ale
which
could
be
a
good
thing
but
it
falls
short
in
certain
areas
drinkablity
decent
european
flavor
with
dark
characteristics
easily
consumed
d
other
than
the
slight
strange
bitter
metallic
taste
this
is
a
good
beer
actually
drinkable
if
you
plug
your
nose
and
dont
expect
anything
spectacular
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
gross
um
i
mean
grolsch
way
too
sweet
that
is
my
first
impression
i
am
kinda
dissappointed
since
it
has
been
compared
to
an
altbier
by
some
people
an
altbier
tastes
different
i
am
thinking
of
flying
to
duesseldorf
to
get
that
real
experience
back
i
just
notice
if
grolsch
amber
is
really
cold
that
sweetness
becomes
less
bothering
i
dont
know
how
this
could
be
superiour
in
any
way
to
newcastle
brownale
by
the
way
pours
a
great
midamber
color
with
wonderful
head
and
good
if
uneven
lacing
it
has
a
nice
scent
a
bit
hoppy
with
a
nice
fruity
kick
although
the
smell
is
not
very
strong
it
has
an
excellent
malty
taste
with
a
bit
of
light
citrustangerine
flavor
its
not
a
hoppy
beer
at
all
it
goes
down
extremely
smooth
its
a
very
good
beer
decided
to
pour
this
into
a
pils
glass
rather
than
a
stange
or
flute
the
smell
was
sharp
as
the
carbonation
kicked
up
there
leaving
a
foamy
twofinger
head
i
picked
up
hints
of
citrus
and
yeast
plus
earth
tones
but
nothing
too
hoppy
and
no
strong
malt
presence
the
taste
is
different
though
as
the
frontkick
is
drying
and
hoppy
but
it
passes
over
the
tongue
smoothly
as
there
might
be
coffee
or
roastburnt
malt
in
there
for
the
price
of
the
6pack
it
wasnt
bad
and
that
aids
its
drinkability
it
is
just
not
complexlacks
depth
that
holds
it
back
salud
did
not
expect
much
from
this
to
begin
with
but
it
was
even
worse
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
would
not
drink
this
again
or
recommend
it
to
anybody
either
bottle
smell
is
a
sweet
lightly
toasted
malt
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
huge
creamy
head
that
clings
like
there
is
no
tomorrow
color
is
well
amber
upon
sipping
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
broad
based
bitterness
that
underscores
but
doesnt
overshadow
the
sweetness
a
typical
holland
beer
by
all
means
but
with
a
twist
the
carbonation
is
good
and
the
body
is
very
heavy
this
is
a
delicious
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
to
brown
color
with
a
beige
one
finger
head
a
lots
of
lace
sheeting
through
the
finish
fruity
aroma
along
with
some
caramel
in
the
nose
fruity
and
bready
slightly
grainy
taste
mouthfeel
light
and
good
carbonation
nicely
balanced
beer
and
i
would
buy
again
pours
a
dark
amber
with
burnt
bread
crust
edges
and
no
head
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
very
slight
just
hints
of
bready
grains
and
some
earthy
claylike
hops
on
the
palate
only
slight
bitterness
thats
identifiable
as
hops
instead
theres
a
medicinal
quality
to
it
like
its
chemically
derived
too
sweet
at
the
midpalate
and
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
and
slightly
metallic
overall
theres
nothing
to
recommend
this
beer
but
its
not
terrible
dthis
will
be
the
last
grolsche
amber
ale
i
will
ever
have
unless
its
the
only
beer
on
tap
drinkability
is
ok
but
there
are
so
many
more
macros
that
are
better
than
this
i
suppose
that
is
not
a
good
thing
to
say
overall
not
bad
not
bad
better
than
expected
im
not
familiear
enough
with
the
altbier
style
to
speak
to
style
adherance
but
this
is
a
decent
brew
nevertheless
i
dont
see
me
paying
a
premium
import
price
tag
for
another
sixer
but
i
wouldnt
decline
a
few
if
offered
worth
a
try
a
delicate
and
flavorful
session
beer
but
maybe
a
bit
dull
in
the
end
starts
off
with
a
brilliantly
clear
abundantly
carbonated
deep
golden
light
copper
hue
with
a
favorable
foamstand
that
laced
throughout
aromas
show
a
balance
of
malt
and
sparged
grains
with
a
mild
noble
hop
grassy
scent
mild
sulfers
is
the
only
deterant
in
the
nose
flavors
also
take
on
a
nice
malt
grain
blend
albeit
a
bit
strained
sweetness
takes
on
light
toasty
biscuity
yeasty
heartiness
with
light
hints
of
caramel
and
powdered
sugar
sweetness
is
balanced
by
german
hops
but
dont
offer
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
feels
light
nearly
watery
thus
finishing
with
a
linger
of
grassy
hops
and
mild
grainhusk
astringency
fair
beer
that
either
needs
to
be
flawless
in
its
style
or
gain
a
bit
more
intensity
in
flavor
and
feel
to
win
beerlovers
over
unfortunately
i
was
in
a
smoky
bar
when
i
tasted
this
so
that
could
have
affected
my
review
that
said
the
aroma
i
could
smell
besides
the
smoke
was
pretty
good
slight
caramel
and
some
aromatic
hops
clarity
was
great
3
out
of
5
on
sweetness
light
body
since
it
was
bottled
i
had
no
head
good
carbonation
and
of
course
you
can
reuse
the
bottle
for
home
brewing
always
a
plus
grolsch
amber
ale
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
clear
twelve
ounce
bottle
theres
a
little
grainyness
in
the
nose
thats
about
it
there
is
more
flavor
than
i
expected
a
bit
of
toasted
grain
some
caramel
malt
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
much
more
interesting
than
i
was
expecting
from
grolsch
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
red
amber
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
like
a
hint
of
smoke
some
sweet
maltiness
is
also
present
taste
is
much
like
a
smoke
beer
bacony
and
malty
maybe
im
just
crazy
though
very
unique
amber
ale
a
bit
watery
but
nothing
to
turn
away
from
solid
mouthfeel
with
a
full
body
and
no
unpleasant
residual
astringency
once
again
though
the
taste
really
isnt
enough
to
make
me
come
back
to
it
just
another
well
made
reliable
inoffensive
brew

its
a
sweet
beer
kind
of
a
hybrid
of
bass
and
newcastle
toffee
toasted
malts
and
a
soft
gentle
hop
aroma
firm
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
i
found
their
amber
ale
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
d
this
was
pretty
good
sometimes
with
oldschool
imports
branch
out
it
isnt
so
good
but
this
was
pretty
good
verdict
lacks
complexity
it
may
not
be
a
great
representative
of
the
style
but
its
availability
makes
it
a
good
standby
beer
for
those
times
when
better
brews
arent
within
reach
smooth
to
a
point
the
malt
gets
old
after
a
while
overall
better
than
the
lager
wish
the
skunkiness
would
go
away
overall
a
bitter
moderately
dark
lager
a
bit
bland
but
certainly
drinkable
if
nothing
better
was
sitting
around
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
true
amber
color
with
a
huge
head
that
leaves
nice
webs
of
lacing
smell
is
all
malt
mostly
of
lighter
corn
but
also
slightly
of
the
amber
malt
and
a
slight
metallic

taste
is
of
caramel
and
toasted

malts
nice
balance
of
hops
slight
metallic
taste
as
with
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
in
my
opinion
better
than
grolschs
premium
lager
good
choice
if
you
are
looking
for
a
change
happy
holidays
from
the
keystone
state
drinkability
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
it
has
a
nice
taste
not
exactly
what
i
expected
from
an
amber
ale
but
definitely
not
unpleasant
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
grolsch
amber
ale
was
clear
and
amber
in
color
it
had
an
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
mainly
malt
the
taste
was
malty
as
well
with
a
slight
twang
and
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
light
with
medium
carbonation
its
nothing
special
and
i
prefer
the
premium
lager
picked
this
up
at
the
local
pbblix
its
amber
in
color
as
it
should
be
it
is
an
amber
ale
it
has
a
good
aroma
it
has
a
complex
robust
taste
and
yet
it
still
pretty
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
there
and
it
is
pretty
strong
you
feel
this
ale
and
it
compliments
the
taste
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
ale
a
huge
step
backward
in
my
search
for
the
best
altbier
im
sorry
but
calling
this
an
altbier
is
like
taking
the
phrase
fine
pilsner
on
the
miller
lite
label
seriously
this
is
a
watereddown
slightly
hoppedup
version
of
newcastle
brown
ale
medium
brownred
almost
artificiallooking
color
slight
head
lots
of
bubbles
smell
is
hops
even
a
bit
of
skunk
and
the
taste
is
like
i
said
a
newcastle
clone
nothing
against
newcastle
but
it
is
what
it
is
i
was
not
impressed
to
paraphrase
a
former
vp
candidate
i
know
altbiers
ive
tasted
altbiers
and
believe
me
this
is
no
altbier
drinking
this
beer
was
a
very
unique
experience
i
looked
at
the
bottle
and
was
very
pleased
with
the
appearance
when
i
took
my
first
sip
however
i
was
rather
suprised
to
find
that
i
was
drinking
nothing
but
water
this
beer
had
minimun
tast
at
best
what
was
worse
was
that
i
couldnt
feel
the
beer
in
my
mouth
at
all
this
critique
might
just
be
me
but
i
felt
that
i
should
have
experienced
a
taste
and
experienced
some
sort
of
feel
in
my
mouth
but
none
was
givento
me
this
is
why
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
again
i
am
still
looking
for
someone
to
shoot
me
in
the
direction
of
a
book
or
place
that
can
teach
me
more
about
the
ways
of
beer
appearance
is
a
copper
color
with
good
ivory
foam
and
lacing
aroma
is
strong
malt
dough
a
faint
hops
initial
taste
contains
sweet
fresh
bread
a
thickish
mouthfeel
crisp
bitter
hops
balanced
nicely
with
malt
the
mildly
sweet
flavor
persists
to
the
end
and
the
finish
is
barley
malt
fruity
hops
and
is
nicely
dry
a
wellbrewed
ale
poured
a
medium
copper
with
tannish
chunky
head
that
threatened
to
escape
from
the
glass
smell
is
very
minimal
with
a
slight
malty
caramel
sweetness
present
taste
is
very
malty
with
some
dry
hoppioness
initially
noted
but
rapidly
fades
to
to
leave
only
the
caramel
malt
finish
is
also
big
on
malt
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
nothing
special
i
probably
wont
buy
any
more
amber
ale
from
grolsch
but
i
wont
be
opposed
to
drinking
it
again
either
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
mildly
sweet
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
aroma
its
simplistic
but
good
smelling
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
basic
malt
bill
pale
and
crystal
malts
its
semisweet
with
a
dry
finish
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
smooth
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
amber
ale
theres
nothing
special
going
on
here
but
it
tastes
good
nonetheless
a
drinkable
brew
no
doubt
and
it
was
ok
imo
but
not
one
i
would
reach
for
with
better
beers
available
overall
drinkabilty
isnt
that
good
after
the
appearance
it
went
downhill
i
still
prefer
this
over
grolsch
premium
lager
though
clear
bottle
pours
dark
copper
with
a
thick
chunky
longlasting
head
aroma
of
dark
i
wanted
to
say
caramel
but
that
didnt
seem
right
malt
with
a
sharp
hoppiness
quite
smooth
malt
flavor
very
tasty
hops
provide
solid
bitterness
but
there
is
something
off
about
it
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
its
certainly
not
the
skunkiness
ive
experienced
with
grolsch
lager
this
is
an
altbier
if
you
say
so
either
way
it
is
decent
for
a
change
of
pace
this
beer
is
copper
colored
with
a
creamy
white
head
it
has
a
malty
bouquet
with
a
slight
dms
dimethyl
sulfide
corn
aroma
it
has
a
nice
mediumbodied
malty
flavor
with
a
light
clean
dry
bitter
finish
not
as
clean
and
smooth
as
schmaltzs
alt
which
i
think
is
a
better
example
of
the
altbier
style
drinkability
i
am
not
impressed
with
this
one
yes
it
is
drinkable
but
i
would
rather
choose
something
else
before
drinking
it
on
another
hand
it
is
easy
to
get
something
worst
than
this
beer
taste
is
about
the
same
rather
balanced
but
certainly
a
tame
example
of
the
style
eager
carbonation
and
a
medlight
body
easily
forgettable
deep
clear
amber
color
with
a
big
white
head
sticks
around
the
glass
a
little
bit
clean
hops
aroma
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
and
wheat
back
ground
taste
twangy
from
the
wheat
and
hops
roasted
malts
some
grains
and
a
clean
finish
smooth
going
down
and
very
drinkable
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
forgettable
but
not
regretable
ive
spent
3
00
on
worse
im
sampling
this
6
months
or
so
after
its
best
by
date
the
beer
doesnt
taste
like
its
been
affected
grolsch
amber
is
brown
in
color
with
an
averagesized
creamy
head
aroma
is
malty
not
too
strong
but
inviting
taste
is
malty
sweet
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
newcastle
brown
but
is
better
tasting
finish
has
a
mild
lingering
sweetness
this
is
a
good
sessionable
beer
not
too
complex
but
very
much
worth
drinking
i
prefer
this
over
original
grolsch
poured
out
to
an
amber
color
decent
white
foamy
head
that
was
quite
dense
when
poured
quickly
aromas
of
hops
with
a
touch
of
floral
odors
flavors
of
roasted
hops
and
malt
slightly
crisp
but
had
a
aftertaste
of
wheat
in
the
finish
not
bad
but
nothing
special
overall
worth
a
try
on
the
bright
side
it
wasnt
skunked
even
with
the
clear
bottle
the
best
that
i
can
say
about
grolsch
amber
is
that
it
has
no
major
faults
as
noted
above
i
consider
it
to
be
a
better
beer
than
its
more
famous
greenlabeled
swingtopped
brother
unfortunately
thats
far
from
a
ringing
endorsement
funny
before
i
became
a
ba
but
after
i
started
sampling
better
beers
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
it
was
better
in
the
swingtop
bottle
which
isnt
available
anywhere
down
here
now
now
this
beer
just
tastes
weak
and
thin
overly
sweet
with
nothing
really
standing
out
i
like
grolsch
lager
when
i
dont
have
a
better
option
but
this
is
nowhere
near
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
a
few
years
ago
how
far
ive
come
id
never
seen
this
one
before
a
fellow
ba
brought
it
over
for
me
to
try
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
fast
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
very
little
hops
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
mostly
comprised
of
biscuit
malts
with
a
slightly
grassy
hop
seems
slightly
thin
but
very
good
beer
this
is
a
good
session
beer

hot
summer
day
could
do
worse
signature
grolsch
definition
i
like
this
beer
better
than
regular
grolsch
color
is
ok
clear
amber
taste
is
roasted
malt
with
a
slightly
metalicchemical
aftertaste
hop
profile
is
ok
but
not
great
over
powered
by
the
sligthly
sweet
malt
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
it
does
go
down
smooth
imagine
if
newcastle
made
a
light
beer
although
i
would
wager
the
abv
is
slighly
lower
than
grolsch
lager
grolschs
amber
ale
is
a
decent
beer
that
doesnt
have
any
major
flaws
other
than
its
profound
unremarkableness
if
thats
a
word
it
was
one
of
my
starter
beers
a
few
years
ago
and
it
would
be
a
good
one
to
use
to
introduce
beer
drinkers
to
the
craft
brew
world
no
complaints
here
malt
profile
took
some
thought
to
sort
out
some
vague
chocolate
malt
flavors
and
a
smokeyness
that
waffled
between
a
peat
smoke
and
oxidation
in
a
blind
tasting
id
probably
have
tried
to
put
this
in
some
sort
of
scottish
category
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
thrown
in
for
good
measure
not
bad
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
not
a
lot
that
engaged
me
looks
great
with
good
head
retention
and
lace
smell
is
weak
but
allmalt
flavor
is
very
weak
malt
and
a
slight
sharpness
contributed
by
the
wheat
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
a
bit
watery
at
times
finishes
clean
and
refreshing
not
offensive
in
the
least
but
boring
light
amber
color
medium
white
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
malty
and
sweet
lighter
bodied
altbier
lightly
hopped
medium
malts
slightly
sweet
mild
flavor
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
hoppy
some
malts
no
bitterness
kind
of
bland
but
a
least
it
dosnt
have
any
objection
flavors
this
was
kind
of
boring
for
a
darker
beer
a
very
average
brew
i
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
but
there
is
nothing
here
that
would
make
me
keep
on
buying
this
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
hue
under
a
thick
tan
head
with
lots
of
contour
the
head
stuck
around
a
long
time
and
left
outstanding
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
nose
was
very
malty
while
the
mouth
was
sweet
and
prickly
the
taste
was
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
with
largely
malty
tones
followed
by
a
decent
hoppy
bitterness
the
aftertaste
was
mainly
hoppy
and
quite
pleasant
despite
the
price
i
liked
it
enough
to
have
another
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
skims
the
top
of
the
glass
but
that
forms
nice
and
delicate
lace
sweet
aroma
subcaramel
and
more
like
dark
brown
sugar
with
some
sense
of
straw
bready
and
biscuity
malt
profile
less
carbonation
than
the
lager
hops
are
slightly
metallic
somewhat
grassy
and
are
earlycomers
to
the
flavor
profile
finishes
fairly
clean
with
some
tart
apple
impression
not
bad
alts
rarely
are
super
memorable
for
me
but
this
is
a
quaffable
beer
the
beers
color
on
the
pour
a
burnished
copper
with
a
massive
head
that
is
frothy
in
texture
and
a
light
tan
color
as
it
evaporates
the
lace
forms
an
adequate
covering
upon
the
glass
nose
is
malt
clean
and
fresh
start
is
sweet
lots
of
malt
top
cadaverous
finish
is
lightly
acidic
lightly
hopped
dry
aftertaste
a
benign
beer
and
one
that
i
suppose
is
suitable
for
a
summer
cookout
as
it
does
wet
your
whistle
a
nice
brew
with
a
meal
recomended
came
with
a
grolsch
bremasters
selection
12pk
2
different
beers
what
variety
enough
with
the
sarcasm
i
paid
8
for
this
12
pack
and
at
that
price
it
was
a
steal
a
clear
brown
beer
with
nice
bubbly
white
head
smell
is
slightly
skunky
and
somewhat
flowery
taste
is
crisp
mellow
with
a
slight
maltiness
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
easy
on
the
wallet
session
brew
theres
really
not
much
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
yet
nothing
stands
out
either
besides
the
trademark
holland
skunk
factor
a
decent
beerand
for
the
price
its
hard
to
beat
i
bought
myself
a
grolsch
sampler
pack
and
encountered
this
beer
for
the
first
time
overall
this
seems
much
more
like
bass
than
regular
grolsch
this
beer
isnt
quite
as
good
as
bass
but
its
still
pretty
good
the
taste
is
a
little
thin
with
the
alcohol
taste
quite
noticable
for
an
import
as
i
said
i
bought
this
beer
in
a
sampler
pack
its
not
very
common
and
not
really
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
find
bass
is
better
however
grolsch
amber
ale
is
pretty
good
drink
it
if
you
have
it
i
know
ive
had
better
samples
of
this
beer
in
the
past
but
if
they
insist
on
selling
it
in
clear
bottles
then
they
will
have
to
live
with
the
consequences
ill
give
this
beer
high
credits
for
a
very
attractive
beer
nice
frothy
head
with
great
stamina
attractive
amber
colors
with
hues
of
brown
and
light
red
clear
but
because
i
think
my
bottle
was
old
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
flat
and
dead
each
had
a
malty
quality
that
wasnt
necessarily
unpleasant
just
dead
the
other
area
for
credit
was
the
very
soft
mouthfeel
in
fact
that
is
what
made
the
bottle
worth
finishing
maybe
if
i
have
a
fresher
bottle
sometime
ill
update
this
and
give
it
the
credit
it
may
deserve
deep
and
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
large
creamcolored
head
that
retains
quite
well
carbonation
is
moderate
the
excellent
lace
leaves
prominent
rings
in
the
glass
aroma
consists
of
dark
and
bready
malt
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
quite
pleasing
taste
begins
with
solid
bready
malt
notes
reminiscent
of
homebaked
dark
bread
finishes
dry
with
substantial
mild
hops
and
dark
fruit
notes
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
this
is
an
unflaggingly
excellent
beer
that
i
will
assuredly
buy
again
a
very
nice
surprise
i
am
quietly
highly
impressed
by
this
very
drinkable
beer
and
all
for
just
80
cents
not
bad
i
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
well
as
soon
as
they
start
to
sell
it
in
the
new
single
women
aisle
anyways

lol
darkish
reddishbrown
amber
offwhite
head
no
real
depth
or
staying
power
but
it
did
produce
waves
of
lace
clean
nose
hints
of
malt
and
grain
a
solid
dollop
of
malt
hits
your
tastebuds
a
faint
hint
of
roastedness
medium
body
good
consistency
not
complex
yet
very
enjoyable
pleasing
clear
bottles
scare
me
but
i
reckon
this
would
make
a
very
good
session
beer
try
it
recommended
pours
with
a
thick
sound
as
the
dense
creamy
offwhite
head
develops
the
head
lasts
a
good
while
leaving
a
coating
of
heavy
lace
on
the
glass
the
beer
is
more
of
a
dark
ambermahogany
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
very
malty
yet
clean
there
is
a
component
that
is
very
inviting
yet
i
cant
quite
place
it
the
flavors
are
many
including
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
fruit
i
want
ot
say
pears
but
that
just
seems
weird
the
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
taste
but
in
a
good
way
it
has
a
rather
creamy
mouthfeel
that
really
caught
me
off
guard
the
hops
are
barely
evident
but
are
present
in
the
finish
and
perhaps
are
the
source
of
the
inviting
aroma
perhaps
one
of
the
more
flavorful
ales
ive
tried
and
an
excellent
beer
that
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
much
better
than
the
lager
which
is
a
good
beer
rich
copper
to
brown
in
color
nice
fluffy
head
that
hangs
in
there
for
a
while
coarse
lace
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
was
of
malt
caramel
and
noble
hops
the
malt
was
the
only
one
that
realy
stood
out
though
roasted
grains
really
came
through
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
tiny
bit
of
bittering
hops
also
there
was
a
dose
of
nice
mouth
warming
alcohol
though
the
abv
is
most
likely
normal
there
may
have
been
a
little
metallic
taste
as
well
there
was
nothing
special
about
the
mouthfeel
very
average
in
every
regard
grolsch
lager
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
mostly
for
sentimental
reasons
and
this
amber
ale
carries
the
name
well
much
better
then
that
god
aweful
blonde
crap
that
had
the
same
dirty
cap
problem
amber
brown
color
foamy
head
floral
caramel
hoppy
nose
toasted

spicy

taste
well
balanced
slightly
bitter
and
enjoyable
light

this
beer
went
very
well
with
my
roasted
turkey
sandwich
on
fresh
white
bread
with
mayo
and
tuong

vietnam
chili
garlic
sauce
and
so
did
the

smooth
very
drinkable
well
rounded

nice
long
lasting
rocky

head
great
teacolored
liquid
smells
a
bit
of
new
mown
hay
with
a
light
malt
aroma
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
due
to
the
addition
of
wheat
malt
with
some
sweet
malt
flavors
creeping
in
finishes
sweet
too
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
overall
smooth
and
very
drinkable
love
the
clear
bottlecool
label
presentation
too
notes
we
can
all
assume
this
is
an
altbier
or
something
close
to
it
i
dare
not
say
german
or
i
might
offend
its
much
further
away
from
american
or
english
styles
so
that
is
what
they
must
have
been
going
for
who
really
cares
right
this
is
a
decent
amber
ale
and
goes
down
just
as
good
as
their
lager
light
amber
color
w
a
decent
head
clear
w
no
chill
haze
slight
toasty
munich
and
caramel
malt
dominate
the
aroma
subdued
floral

the
aroma
is
all
around
clean
and
unassertive
light
body
with
a
smooth
and
agreeable
mouthfeel
hop
bitterness
is
fairly
low
and
leaves
the
beer
w
a
slight
residual
sweetness
that
isnt
overbearing
no
surprises
in
flavor
in
this
brew
innocuous
quaffable
and
much
better
than
grolsch
in
the
green
bottle
a
pleasant
surprise
this
beer
didnt
impress
me
whatsoever
infact
it

and
slight
hoppy
notes
on

clean

with

this
is
a
really
good
brew
very
similar
to
regular
grolsch
lager
not
what
id
label
as
a
true
premium
beer
and
not
entirely
lame
and
boring
like

were
very
much
what
i
expected
for
the

a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
o
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
getting
through
the
bomber
solo
is
almost
too
easy
more
proof
that
local
is
the
way
to
go
overall
this
is
a
great
offering
from
buzzards
bay
brewing
i
like
that
it
isnt
one
of
their
more
hop
forward
less
malty
beers
it
does
have
a
great
caramel
malty
taste
and
it
is
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
bring
this
beer
to
your
next
fall
gathering
and
pair
it
with
some
sausages
decent
overall
worth
the
small
price
tag
atmosphere
okay
slight
head
plenty
of
effervescence
and
some
fair
lacing
nose
is
nutty
mapley
and
a
synthetic
sweetness
bitter
nut
shells
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
o
definitely
one
of
the
hoppiest
altbiers
that
i
have
ever
experienced
and
different
than
the
ones
i
had
in
düsseldorf
i
found
it
to
be
an
americanized
version
of
the
style
and
enjoyable
pretty
easy
to
drink
o
this
beer
definitely
tastes
like
an
americaninfluenced
version
of
an
altbier
as
its
a
little
more
hoppier
compared
to
the
types
of
beers
brewed
in
düsseldorf
overall
pass
the
harpoonor
a
harpoon
the
bottles
simple
image
fascinated
me
into
a
purchase
but
this
pale
ale
pales
to
much
meatier
mellower
enjoyable
brews
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
pretty
boring
for
the
style
yes
i
recommend
i
really
really
liked
this
one
although
i
had
it
after
a
12
marathon
race
so
i
was
really
thirsty
the
flavor
feminded
me
of
toasted
nuts
kissed
with
mild
sweetness
and
was
really
nice
to
drink
it
was
perfect
with
the
smoky
flavors
of
the
sandwich
i
ordered
o
the
harsh
and
rough
taste
is
hard
to
get
through
with
the
husky
flavor
and
hops
only
coming
through
as
a
bitter
bite
very
drinkable
this
beer
made
for
a
great
hot
day
on
the
lake
overall
bought
this
not
knowing
anything
about
it
and
boy
i
was
satisfied
it
is
rich
and
would
satisfy
most
if
not
all
palates
salud
overall
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
ale
as
much
an
esb
as
an
apa
in
my
opinion
very
quaffable
i
love
malty
pale
ales
and
this
is
definately
one
of
the
better
ones
highly
recommended
nice
job
by
this
new
brewery
cheers
22oz
bottle
label
is
not
fancy
but
i
found
the
beer
to
be
a
nice
amber
color
and
head
that
lasted
for
a
while
the
smell
was
a
typical
pale
ale
and
taste
was
right
on
this
american
pale
ale
went
down
easy
and
my
friends
were
impressed
with
the
beer
would
recommend
this
my
friends
just
a
bit
too
much
tart
and
unbalanced
bitterness
going
on
for
me
to
rank
higher
recommended
for
something
sessionable
lots
of
flavor
here
for
a
5
apa
and
2
99
a
bomber
its
one
of
the
best
deals
around
these
parts
awesome
definitely
the
goto
session
beer
when
its
fresh
which
seems
to
be
often
sometimes
called
an
american
mild
and
drinkability
is
okay
wish
the
flavor
worked
better
for
me

a
home
run
for
the
price
as
well
brewers
share
phils
existential
alt
o
overall
a
decent
beer
i
think
the
aging
of
this
particular
one
may
not
have
been
a
good
thing
for
it
but
either
way
still
worth
a
try
the
beer
starts
out
with
promise
including
the
taste
but
it
soon
loses
much
of
its
appeal
overall
the
malt
flavors
seem
weaker
with
each
mouthful
and
the
body
comes
across
more
watery
one
is
left
with
a
slightly
overbitter
ale
flavor
i
hoped
for
better
and
its
drinkable
but
falls
flat
in
the
long
run
my
pour
created
two
fingers
of
dense
foamy
lighttan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deepcopper
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
lightly
molasseslike
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
molasseslike
flavor
on
the
tongue
definitely
not
malty
but
not
bitter
either
it
landed
somewhere
in
the
middle
ground
of
the
two
flavors
finish
definitely
had
the
grassiness
of
german
noble
hops

is
nice
and
smooth
with
some
rich
malty

toast
and
maybe
a
light

sweetness
the
hops
are
just
about
perfect
and
add
a
nice
flavor
and
bittering
balance
this
is
actually
the
second
bottle
of
this
i
have
bought
good
price
point
for
a
bomber
and
i
think
it
is
a
damn
fine
altbier
the
nutty
yeast
makes
more
of
an
impact
as
it
warms
and
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
however
but
thats
pretty
common
with
the
type
overall

must
be

behind

a

tan

smells
malty
and
germanic
flavor
is
yeasty
with
dark
grain
dark
bread
and
caramel
i
enjoy
the
altbier
style
and
this
one
seems
to
fit
right
in
line
although
my
experience
with
the
style
is
mild
at
best
i
loved
its
light
body
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
have
ever
tried
but
had
it
again
and
it
sparked
some
nostalgia
great
malty
ale
smooth
great
with
dinner
this
beer
is
a
tad
on
the
sweeter
side
and
while
nothing
amazing
it
is
an
agreeable
everyday
brown
ale
that
most
will
find
good
enough
to
recommend
as
i
said
it
is
very
approachable
and
makes
a
good
choice
when
you
want
some
brown
ale
to
serve
guests
and
dont
want
to
offend
anyone
o
nice
beer
not
up
to
the
german
alt
style
at
all
but
a
pleasant
american
brown
ale
variant
this
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
tuckermans
before
so
ill
have
to
make
it
a
point
to
try
more
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
thirsty
moose
a
bold
tasting
malt
with
nutty
elements
of
a
brown
ale
an
acidic
tartness
unexpected
sweet
malt
in
the
aroma
very
dark
red
and
lacey
a
bit
watery
not
so
drinkable
maybe
another
place
another
time
would
yield
better
results
overall
a
nice
surprise
a
few
flaws
but
it
still
works
a
good
one
from
these
guys
good
solid
beer
from
a
brewery
i
dont
know
a
ton
about
if
i
see
another
sixer
of
them
around
ill
probably
be
picking
it
up
o
a
very
unique
taste
for
me
first
alt
type
beer
i
like
it
will
try
again
o
all
in
all
this
is
nothing
special
this
brew
seems
to
bring
nothing
new
to
the
style
nor
does
it
really
take
anything
away
its
a
very
mild
interpretation
this
may
be
a
good
bmc
to
craft
conversion
brew
o
a
nice
earthy
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
please
the
palate
a
sublime
altbier
d
fairly
balanced
just
leaning
slightly
to
malts
but
with
fair
bittering
and
bit
of
hop
flavor
a
rather
nice
rendition
of
the
style
certainly
the
better
of
the
two
from
the
12
pk
of
these
and
the
pale
ale
this
one
is
a
good
session
beer
that
is
slightly
heartier
than
another
popular
alt
from
northern
new
england
and
more
sessionable
as
well
single
that
i
picked
up
a
while
back
and
opened
tonight
poured
into
a
irish
style
pint
glass
dark
auburn
colored
body
great
amount
of
carbonation
surging
upwards
and
a
nice
amounts
remains
as
i
drink
the
thin
white
head
forms
and
just
doesnt
go
away
it
stayed
intact
the
whole
time
which
doesnt
seem
to
happen
very
often
not
much
lacing
though
smell
had
some
nice
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
dominated
by
malt
i
enjoyed
the
hearty
nutty
taste
and
the
creamy
mouthfeel
the
low
abv
is
a
bonus
as
i
could
see
myself
quaffing
a
few
of
these
very
drinkable
id
get
this
again
draught
barley
pub
this
one
poured
a
clear
dark
caramel
color
there
was
a
small
offwhite
head
that
didnt
linger
or
leave
any
lacing
it
has
a
lighter
aroma
some
caramel
notes
some
toasted
malts
also
the
taste
is
nice
some
toasted
caramel
malt
with
a
very
faint
chocolate
malt
taste
slightly
bitter
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
nice
overall
not
bad
nothing
special
a
but
lighter
than
i
expected
but
a
nice
malt
profile
maybe
a
bit
light
on
the
hops
as
well
overall
not
too
bad
but
feels
a
little
downplayed
the
spice
angle
on
this
is
totally
unexpected
and
a
nice
touch
overall
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
fresh
fruity
nutty
and
refreshing
fairly
light
for
the
style
but
the
low
abv
keeps
it
so
drinkable
what
it
does
it
does
well
and
i
would
happily
reach
for
another
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dark
beers
it
is
wonderfully
balanced
in
flavor
and
much
lighter
in
feel
than
most
dark
beers
but
is
still
able
to
hold
up
to
a
full
pizza
such
as
those
at
flatbread
where
i
get
it
regularly
d
great
flavors
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
what
more
could
you
ask
it
is
a
wonderful
beer
in
its
simplicity
a
nice
looking
beer
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
and
a
dense
tan
cap
lots
of
chunky
clinging
lace
good
head
retention
malty
aroma
roast
cereal
grains
mild
bitterness
up
front
was
more
prominent
in
the
finish
malty
throughout
roasty
some
dry
astringency
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
glad
i
tried
this
but
not
something
ill
be
seeking
out
again
eh
goes
down
ok
would
be
better
if
not
for
the
metallic
aroma
and
chewing
on
tinfoil
flavor
it
is
not
the
dominant
quality
but
it
is
there
and
it
detracts
a
bit
d
love
the
amount
of
flavor
packed
in
to
an
under
5
abv
brew
i
could
certainly
have
a
few
and
not
complain
one
bit
the
feel
to
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
with
a
nice
drinkable
feel
it
goes
down
well
and
makes
for
a
good
session
ale
d
very
nice
incredibly
flavorful
great
grainiac
beer
d
quite
drinkable
although
not
my
favorite
of
browns
i
would
definitely
buy
myself
another
round
of
this
d
good
solid
drinkable
beer
the
brew
is
a
nice
chestnut
brown
witha
rocky
foamy
tan
head
leaves
nice
lacing
nice
clean
malty
aroma
the
flavor
shows
an
excellent
balance
with
malt
and
hops
that
makes
alt
such
a
refershing
and
drinkable
style
yet
with
a
toasty
heft
really
nice
job
a
light
crispy
and
jazzy
malty
feel
and
flavor
light
biscuit
dark
wheat
bread
dry
spicey
hops
and
sour
from
the
yeast
a
most
excellent
balance
clean
light
feel
keeps
it
going
strong
for
a
long
session
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
an
expiration
date
of
february
10
sampled
on
december
31
2009
it
pours
a
maple
syrupbrown
with
three
quarters
inch
frothy
longlasting
beige
head
the
aroma
has
a
kind
of
perfumeywooden
note
to
it
as
well
as
a
welcome
cleanliness
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
sweetness
that
comes
up
on
the
tail
end
a
nice
brew
even
being
less
then
inspired
with
this
beer
i
can
see
casually
consuming
a
few
before
really
considering
to
put
up
an
effort
to
change
speeds
d
good
brown
ale
although
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
a
sixpack
d
i
had
this
at
acbf
and
i
liked
it
more
there
probably
because
it
was
a
little
bit
cooler
a
really
nice
beer
on
the
plus
side
their
staff
are
class
acts
simple
balanced
beers
dont
get
their
fair
shake
a
lot
of
times
its
hard
to
give
a
5
for
taste
if
it
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
but
sometimes
you
arent
looking
for
a
complicated
beer
to
appreciate
just
a
simple
one
to
enjoy
i
think
this
may
be
that
beer
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
mild
beer
with
some
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
whole
evening
out
of
a
bottle
purchased
in
lancaster
nh
this
german
style
brown
ale
was
a
deep
garnetruby
red
color
with
three
fingers
of
tan
head
the
retention
was
good
as
a
small
cap
and
the
lacing
sticky
the
aroma
was
of
toasted
malt
and
dry
grains
the
flavors
were
similar
very
dry
and
neat
toasted
malt
and
hoppy
bitterness
in
a
good
balance
not
complex
but
onpoint
for
the
style
rather
acidic
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
oily
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
par
for
the
course
strikes
me
as
more
of
a
brown
ale
a
touch
of
ale
fruitiness
hangs
faintly
in
there
no
notable
hop
presence
but
the
bottle
dates
to
march
08
so
i
suppose
thats
to
be
expected
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
with
a
little
nutty
oil
mediumtohigh
carbonation
solid
sessioner
not
sure
if
its
quite
right
as
an
alt
but
ill
rate
it
as
a
nonetooshabby
brown
although
i
like
this
beer
i
feel
that
the
dry
hopping
goes
overboard
and
overshadows
the
malty
sweetness
of
the
alt
style
but
still
very
good
i
like
their
pale
and
stout
way
better
pours
dark
amber
light
mahogany
dark
tan
medium
bubble
head
showing
some
retentive
powers

would

it

12102004
sampled
on
tap
this
is
a
new
brown
ale
thats
been
introduced
by
tuckerman
brewing
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
browncopper
color
flavor
is
rich
malts
semisweet
with
a
slightly
bitter

finish
malts
are
strong
up

and
the
rest
of
it
seems
rather
weak
id
get
it
again
though
drinkability
easy
drinking
one
of
those
beers
that
go
down
real
easy
very
nice
brown
beer
to
taste
i
havent
had
all
that
many
alt
beers
but
if
this
is
representative
of
the
style
i
think
ive
been
missing
out
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
pours
a
dark
amber
slightly
cloudy
color
it
is
quite
carbonated
with
a
slightly
soapy
tan
head
that
hangs
on
and
laces
nicely
the
smell
is
a
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hops
perhaps
a
bit
nut
brown
or
chocolatey
hints
in
there
as
well
this
beer
is
exceptionally
creamy
quite
mellow
with
soft
caramel
and
nut
flavors
and
a
nice
balance
the
taste
is
mellow
perhaps
slightly
tilted
to
the
watery
side
but
there
are
plenty
of
roasted
notes
in
the
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
between
the
prodigious
carbonation
the
creamy
mouthfeel
and
the
light
brown
tastes
throughout
you
cant
go
wrong
there
is
a
bit
more
hop
in
the
finish
but
this
is
just
a
really
laid
back
type
of
beer
that
would
suffice
for
all
occasions
lchaim
this
brew
pours
a
solid
brown
with
a
thin
layer
of
foam
smell
is
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
some
caramel
and
some
chocolate
and
a
slight
hint
of
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
same
a
definite
nuttiness
to
this
one
along
with
a
solid
dose
of
hops
pretty
tasty
overall
mouthfeel
is
solid
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
feel
this
would
make
for
a
pretty
nice
session
ale
overall
its
low
abv
and
solid
flavor
would
allow
you
to
drink
quite
a
few
pours
a
solid
brown
that
shows
some
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
two
finger
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
a
bit
roasty
chocolatey
and
some
caramel
thrown
in
there
too
taste
follows
the
smell
but
adds
a
hop
bite
in
the
finish
medium
thick
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
great
little
session
brew
from
an
up
and
coming
local
company
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
opaque
brown
with
some
red
highlights
when
backlit
threequarter
inch
offwhite
head
slowly
dissipated
into
quarter
inch
layer
of
foam
that
retained
its
volume
through
the
session
fair
amount
of
lacing
with
decent
consistency
throughout
the
tasting
nose
presented
with
roasted
malt
and
hops
taste
similar
to
nose
with
addition
of
a
slightly
floral
aftertaste
slightly
bitter
at
the
finish
nicely
effervescent
mouthfeel
and
low
abv
makes
this
a
good
session
beer
and
a
slightly
different
alternative
to
an
english
or
american
brown
ale
with
slightly
more
emphasis
on
the
hops
than
the
malt
d
a
little
hoppy
for
the
style
but
works
well
with
the
mix
of
flavors
the
carbonation
adds
a
nice
kick
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
special
roast
malts
it
also
has
a
light
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
crisp
brown
ale
flavor
with
a
mild
hop
finish
its
not
as
malty
as
some
altbiers
its
dryer
with
a
more
roasted
component
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
but
there
are
better
alts
on
the
market
its
a
nice
american
interpretation
of
a
german
alt
a
bit
hoppy
for
the
style
but
not
overly
so
and
it
works
well
here
certainly
fuller
in
taste
and
body
than
some
other
american
interpretations
drinkable
and
enjoyable

tiny
sediment
keeps
it
from
being
perfectly
clear
smell
is
a
wonderful
blast
of
fresh
and
clean
toasty
malt
devoid
of
fruitiness
in
the
taste
as
an
alt
should
be
the
clean
malt
flavor
dominates
hops
are
to
balance
and
lead
into
a
limelike
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
leaning
towards
creamy
most
of
the
alt
beers
out
there
are
of
a
copper
color
with
a
medium
crisp
carbonation
and
this
one
is
brown
and
smooth
but
still
retains
that
clean
malt
alt
beer
characteristic
its
uniqueness
is
a
reason
to
seek
out
and
its
flavor
is
a
reason
to
keep
going
back
to
it
d
easily
drinkable
quite
sessionable
a
good
take
on
what
i
would
define
as
an
american
alt
drinkability
i
like
this
one
quite
drinkable
alcohol
unlisted
but
likely
low
enough
to
be
drinkable
pours
a
chestnut
brown
with
a
white
fluffy
head
good
residual
lacing
smells
of
malt
and
sweet
yeast
the
taste
is
really
well
balanced
good
bitterness
all
the
way
through
nice
malty
characteristics
nothing
overpowering
balanced
is
how
i
would
sum
this
beer
up
very
dead
on
for
the
style
another
beer
to
make
new
hampshire
proud
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
wispy
head
malty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
toastiness
the
roastiness
comes
across
in
the
flavor
in
a
big
way
followed
by
a
bit
of
hop
twang
as
others
have
noted
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tea
flavor
that
shows
itself
between
the
malt
and
hops
pretty
well
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
i
dont
know
if
its
a
good
representation
of
the
alt
style
but
its
a
pretty
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
the
flavors
of
an
alt
are
present
but
are
limited
by
the
dryness
and
carbonation
a
decent
version
of
an
altbier
but
not
my
favorite
depiction
a
good
take
on
the
altbier
style
pours
a
clear
chestnut
brown
body
beneath
a
creamy
head
of
light
tan
the
head
retention
is
average
and
it
drops
shortly
but
leaves
some
nice
lace
before
it
goes
the
body
is
medium
and
it
has
a
delicate
finebubbled
median
carbonation
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
delicate
note
of
caramel
and
thats
true
for
the
flavor
as
well
its
not
meant
to
be
complex
just
balanced
solidly
bitter
as
it
should
be
it
lingers
on
the
tongue
with
some
mild
residual
leafy
hop
notes
and
a
dull
bitter
note
enjoyable
probably
worth
trying
this
altbier
poured
a
clear
chestnut
redbrown
color
with
creamy
fluffy
tan
foam
that
slowly
settled
and
clung
and
coated
the
glass
the
smell
was
malty
with
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
not
sweet
with
moderate
hoppiness
coming
through
and
a
touch
of
yeast
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
with
medium
body
and
smooth
carbonation
the
aftertaste
was
light
lingering
malt
and
mild
hoppiness
this
was
a
very
nice
german
style
altbier
this
was
a
dark
brown
beer
with
reddish
highlights
it
had
a
thick
coffeecolored
head
nice
looking
beer
it
had
a
roasted
grain
aroma
and
i
thought
a
touch
of
nut
taste
was
sweet
caramel
malt
a
bit
hoppy
and
again
a
touch
of
nut
a
heavier
beer
than
it
looked
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
would
do
it
for
me
a
very
good
brew
and
one
im
pleased
to
have
picked
up
on
a
whim
it
cant
hurt
that
i
got
a
free
pint
glass
out
of
the
deal
it
looks
like
this
brewery
only
has
a
few
offerings
thus
far
hopefully
that
will
change
in
the
future
drinkability
is
ok
two
or
so
go
down
well
not
really
a
session
brew
as
the
metallic
flavor
tends
to
build
up
rather
than
fading
this
is
an
excellent
offering
in
the
world
of
brown
beers
id
love
to
compare
this
german
to
a
traditional
english
brown
deep
coffee
amber
color
thin
head
that
leaves
a
frothy
crust
aroma
of
lightly
toasted
cinnamon
nut
and
coffee
bean
taste
is
a
robust
toasty
biscuit
like
flavor
that
fades
leaving
a
slight
bitterness
toward
the
end
less
complex
than
the
aroma
suggested
but
a
flavor
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
medium
body
with
soft
foamy
carbonation
this
one
drinks
pretty
well
but
could
use
just
a
bit
more
excitement
to
make
a
session
ale
out
of
it
medium
brown
on
the
pour
hazy
with
small
flecks
of
yeast
floating
about
generous
fizzy
almond
flesh
head
settling
into
a
thick
film
no
lacing
floral
hops
are
readily
apparent
in
the
aroma
with
grainy
slightly
roasty
malt
a
bit
chocolatey
the
flavor
opens
with
grainy
malt
just
a
bit
charry
and
chocolatey
fairly
clean
with
some
ale
fruitiness
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
for
an
authentic
german
alt
everything
from
the
fatherland
seems
to
be
clean
as
a
whistle
lighter
medium
body
with
sturdy
carbonation
pretty
easy
drinking
more
of
an
american
brown
ale
with
altbier
traits
nevertheless
its
a
tasty
beer
grainy
through
and
through
with
robust
floral
hops
in
the
finish
a
touch
of
citrus
giving
it
that
american
flair
moderate
bitterness
a
little
bit
of
metallic
flavor
in
the
end
finishing
clean
and
dry
very
much
a
darker
american
ale
rather
than
anything
german
reminding
me
of
mid
90s
microbrews
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
lacking
refinement
but
thats
what
you
like
about
them
tasted
071506
overall
a
nice
beer
i
think
it
improves
greatly
as
it
warms
i
think
with
a
thinner
body
it
would
be
a
regular
for
me
as
it
is
i
will
enjoy
it
on
occasion
ps
im
finished
and
the
lacing
is
still
on
the
top
of
the
glass
nice
poured
a
hazy
copper
color
with
offwhite
creamy
head
attractive
lacing
as
the
head
very
slowly
fell
smell
is
very
light
with
some
slight
notes
of
roasted
malt
to
be
found
taste
is
pleasant
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
characted
combined
with
an
impressive
hop
background
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
an
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
settles
into
a
18
creamy
head
that
stays
throughout
the
whole
beer
spicy
aroma
with
some
roastiness
taste
has
a
slight
chocolate
tinge
roasted
malt
slight
toungue
burn
carbontion
a
little
citrus
on
the
back
of
the
mouth
this
beer
is
drinkable
i
dont
know
if
meets
the
alt
ber
style
but
an
all
right
beer
saw
this
on
tap
along
with
the
bmc
choices
i
would
gladlt
order
this
a
clear
light
brown
color
with
some
red
tones
head
was
fairly
small
the
aroma
was
of
malt
coffee
hops
caramel
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
more
towards
hops
than
malt
with
a
burnt
toast
flavor
in
the
finish
no
metallic
in
main
or
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
very
crisp
and
astringent
overall
highly
drinkable
and
light
beer
poured
a
reddishbrown
with
a
well
sustaining
fluffy
white
head
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
very
pleasant
taste
at
the
beginning
was
very
malty
but
the
hops
are
becoming
more
prevelant
now
almost
astringent
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
worth
a
shot
d
appearance
and
smell
started
off
good
but
went
down
hill
from
there
d
high
easy
down
would
be
great
for
a
beginner
di
dont
care
for
this
one
much
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
at
all
im
thinking
that
i
might
not
like
this
style
very
much
d
a
great
job
at
tackling
the
altbier
style
very
tasty
and
paired
well
with
some
grilled
bratwurst
i
was
happily
surprised
to
see
it
in
sixpacks
in
ma
from
a
12oz
bottle
copper
color
with
rocky
offwhite
head
and
little
lacing
nose
is
warm
nutty
and
a
little
bit
of
fresh
baked
bread
or
muffins
palate
is
likewise
quite
malty
and
breadlike
with
only
a
slight
hop
presence
enough
to
make
the
finish
relatively
dry
and
keep
the
mouthfeel
from
being
cloying
to
me
there
is
nothing
exciting
here
its
okay
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
way
i
could
taste
any
number
of
brown
ales
that
would
be
very
similar
and
can
think
of
several
that
are
much
better
this
was
my
first
alt
from
what
i
know
of
the
style
it
seems
to
be
apropos
on
most
criteria
the
tea
note
is
kind
of
weird
to
me
for
a
germanstyle
beer
though
this
is
a
well
balanced
very
tasty
brew
easy
to
drink
and
very
pretty
in
the
glass
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
light
tan
head
over
the
clear
copperish
brown
brew
head
fades
slowly
with
average
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
grain
husks
with
light
hoppiness
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
medium
malts
dancing
with
the
rounded
hops
throughout
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
nice
i
can
see
this
beer
again
in
my
fridge
had
a
last
lonely
bottle
i
was
holdeing
onto
but
now
that
i
know
its
finally
available
in
ma
ill
be
going
out
to
get
me
some
more
pours
hazy
browngold
with
an
impressive
head
smells
like
it
was
made
yesterday
its
still
so
fresh
after
being
in
my
fridge
for
a
month
and
a
half
all
the
classic
components
come
through
one
at
a
time
citrus
hops
coriander
nah
it
couldnt
have
beenwhat
is
that
im
tasting
but
the
slightly
malty
finish
wraps
it
all
up
in
one
clean
punch
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
and
its
a
real
treat
to
finally
have
another
beer
from
these
great
folks
moutfeel
is
pretty
creamy
but
without
being
too
heavy
pleasant
and
enjoyable
decently
drinkable
this
stuff
is
alright
pours
a
twofinger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
not
quite
clear
deep
amber
color
vague
malty
nose
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
starts
with
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
some
sweetness
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
no
real
difference
between
the
bottle
and
on
tap
1
30
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capital
convenience
concord
nh
drinkability
is
not
very
good
i
only
got
this
because
im
a
fan
of
the
alt
style
taste
okay
the
taste
conforms
a
little
bit
more
caramel
malts
dominates
and
has
a
fruity
mouthfeel
maybe
again
a
little
too
much
hop
finish
brewed
to
style
no
enjoyable
much
more
than
their
pale
ale
which
tasted
too
infected
to
review
slightly
sweet
with
a
firm
bitterness
that
balances
nicely
great
brew
this
altbier
german
for
old
style
style
brew
pours
a
pretty
copperamber
in
color
with
close
to
a
finger
of
a
offwhite
foamy
head
some
ringlike
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
mostly
nutty
roasted
malts
pretty
much
is
said
for
the
taste
as
well
with
good
very
light
bitter
finish
that
doesnt
last
too
long
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
brew
o
overall
not
a
bad
ale
but
not
remarkable
the
medium
body
has
both
crispness
and
smoothness
to
it
though
it
leans
light
and
the
soft
carbonation
keeps
up
at
the
end
of
the
session
slightly
less
than
it
began
overall
glad
i
got
to
try
it
this
is
a
solid
if
not
particularly
memorable
local
beer
from
lawrence
kanasas
this
is
a
rather
dark
beer
with
a
small
fuzzy
head
and
as
advertised
a
great
balance
between
malts
and
hops
the
malts
will
hit
you
firstsmooth
coffeeflavored
fullbodied
then
come
the
grainy
spicy
hops
the
flavor
is
rather
pronounced
but
neither
element
is
very
strong
great
beer
overall
i
think
there
is
one
way
to
describe
this
beer
an
awesome
american
take
on
a
german
style
that
might
beat
the
native
germans
in
terms
of
a
smooth
drinking
lager
the
beer
poured
ruby
redbrownish
the
head
was
thin
and
not
too
hearty
as
is
disappeared
quickly
it
did
maintain
a
little
head
to
the
finish
but
the
lacing
was
scant
the
taste
was
somewhat
bready
with
a
hint
of
molasses
mouthfeel
was
really
nice
very
crisp
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
o
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
a
nice
well
crafted
beer
mouthfeel
is
average
drinkability
is
wonderful
o
another
solid
beer
from
free
state
this
one
doesnt
do
anything
mindblowing
but
is
still
a
very
well
crafted
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
strong
it
has
a
nice
finish
to
it
but
not
my
favorite
alt
ive
had
a
little
roasty
on
the
back
end
eh
i
might
have
it
again
overall
i
like
it
i
just
may
not
have
this
one
very
often
its
an
easydrinking
beer
and
well
crafted
from
this
brewery
a
beautiful
deep
amber
pour
with
a
half
inch
of
head
smells
of
floral
hops
caramel
sweetness
and
honey
tastes
of
chocolate
cherry
caramel
really
sweet
light
body
crossing
over
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
very
easy
to
go
down
very
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
overall
o
honestly
not
bad
a
pretty
simple
and
malty
beer
drinkable
and
inoffensive
overall
it
was
a
bit
more
complex
that
i
thought
it
would
be
i
liked
it
and
if
i
was
reaching
for
something
out
of
my
norm
i
would
drink
it
again
pours
a
clear
brown
color
64
inch

of
an

great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
slight
earthy

slight
caramel

hops
slight
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
citrus
fits
the
style
of
an

feel
is

clean
with
an
average

tastes
of
sweet

of

hint
of

slight
earthy

a

freshly

is
initially
some
munich

sweetness
followed
by
a
cinnamony
rye
bread
middle
and
a
slightly
tart
earthy
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
cask
like
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
not
too
often
you
find
an
altbier
in
the
usa
drink
its
good
i
liked
it
but
needs
to
even
out
with
some
pop
behind
it
drinks
easy
enough
but
nothing
special
as
alts
go
yet
another
superior
kansas
beer
im
becoming
quite
the
fan
of
ks
beers
i
must
admit
i
like
the
beer
overall
but
the
flavor
on
the
finish
is
a
little
strange
pours
an
amberish
copper
with
a
creamy
white
head
on
it
smells
of
toasts
malts
with
a
bit
of
nut
character
the
taste
is
close
to
the
nose
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
but
deviates
from
the
aroma
in
that
it
has
a
stronggrassy
hop
bitterness
i
dont
lnow
if
it
my
palate
or
this
brewery
but
i
am
getting
a
lot
of
grass
hop
on
their
beers
as
ith
their
other
beers
i
really
enjoy
the
story
behind
the
name
and
appreciate
the
effort
put
into
the
beer
but
it
isnt
one
i
would
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
for
worth
a
try
though
definitely
not
a
great
beer
but
i
certainly
could
drink
a
lot
of
them
thanks
dan
and
ratman
for
sharing
this
one
last
night
although
i
sincerly
appreciate
it
i
did
not
enjoy
it
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
on
top
aromas
of
cardboard
nuts
and
caramel
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
cardboard
roasted
nuts
and
caramel
malt
kind
of
sad
maybe
this
one
sat
for
a
while
this
was
quite
an
interesting
beer
with
some
characteristics
keeping
this
closer
to
traditional
amber
ale
and
then
others
finding
their
over
more
over
to
the
altbier
category
it
never
really
seems
to
find
its
footing
in
the
middle
of
the
two
that
being
said
though
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
in
any
way
and
just
seems
a
little
confused
there
is
still
more
than
enough
flavor
and
drinkibility
for
you
to
take
a
chance
on
it
worth
a
look
the
beer
pours
a
deep
rusty
copper
with
a
rocky
white
head
the
head
dissipates
to
leave
a
sticky
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
pure
malty
sweetness
the
beer
tastes
of
sweet
roasty
malts
with
a
good
balance
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
of
the
drink
the
beer
finishes
relative
clean
with
just
a
slight
malty
sweetness
this
is
one
of
those
great
sessionable
beers
well
worth
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
o
this
is
a
nice
fallwinter
beer
i
really
like
this
and
it
would
be
good
as
a
dinner
pairing
as
well
with
a
burger
or
steak
or
bbq
a
nice
example
of
the
altbier
style
this
is
an
ok
beer
too
sweet
and
malty
for
me
the
lack
of
any
hop
character
is
a
downer
for
me
great
beer
but
not
in
the
category
for
me
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
is
a
plus
though
great
beer
free
state
brewing
d
very
nice
drinkable
beer
first
beer
from
free
state
but
hopefully
not
the
last
mouthfeeldrinkability
in
between
light
and
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
drinking
overall
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
pretty
nice
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
free
state
ad
astra
ale
is
a
beer
i
got
from
a
reddit
secret
santa
gift
it
is
a
nice
looking
reddish
brown
beer
with
just
a
little
lace
of
rocky
head
the
beer
smells
darkly
toasty
like
pumpernickel
bread
and
also
a
little
sweet
caramel
malt
the
beer
is
a
little
fruity
very
nicely
malty
and
accented
with
good
german
hoppy
bittering
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
aftertaste
that
i
definitely
enjoyed
will
be
in
my
normal
rotation
as
long
as
i
can
keep
getting
it
around
town
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
slight
rusty
tint
short
white
head
the
nose
brigs
some
fruits
and
lift
caramel
plus
a
small
amount
of
hops
bad
news
underneath
though
just
like
other
beers
here
we
were
unfortunate
to
get
somethig
bad
going
on
as
the
taste
here
was
quite
buttery
as
well
luckily
this
hadnt
pervaded
other
aspects
of
the
beer
all
that
much
its
too
bad
as
i
really
enjoyed
their
barleywine
and
that
had
no
off
flavors
at
all
maybe
we
just
happened
to
catch
a
bad
time
either
with
brewing
or
bad
lines
it
was
at
the
brewpub
though
so
either
way
i
have
to
say
that
its
on
them
this
is
my
favorite
at
the
local
water
hole
the
poor
is
full
with
a
nice
12
inch
head
that
is
creamy
white
the
smell
is
rather
intoxicating
itself
but
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
it
goes
down
glass
after
glass
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
usually
reminding
me
of
plum
it
carries
a
good
amount
of
kick
and
after
5
i
feel
like
i
want
one
more
it
has
the
right
balance
between
hoppiness
and
yeast
which
makes
this
altbier
a
pure
delight
d
very
drinkable
for
the
smooth
and
fine
quality
of
the
malt
a
good
medium
bodied
ale
with
a
hefty
malt
flavor
and
a
light
balance
of
floral
hops
this
is
one
of
the
most
popular
beers
in
lawrence
and
it
is
obvious
why
i
can
only
hope
freestate
goes
national
soon
its
a
good
choice
and
recipe
for
a
house
beer
different
enough
not
to
be
just
another
amber
ale
in
the
portfolio
free
state
is
an
impressive
little
brewery
that
is
slowly
but
surly
expanding
their
ad
astra
ale
is
one
of
their
oldest
offering
but
it
holds
up
as
a
worthy
part
of
their
lineup
it
is
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
clarity
the
head
doesnt
last
long
it
smells
and
tastes
malty
and
reminds
me
of
a
marzen
style
beer
it
drinks
smoothly
and
cleanly
excellent
for
accompanying
food
a
definite
favorite
aroma
was
mainly
malty
with
mild
multigrain
and
sunflower
seed
notes
flavor
was
similarly
bready
with
some
light
sweetness
that
finished
dry
there
were
some
notes
of
earthy
hop
as
it
came
to
room
temperature
the
body
was
light
for
an
alt
but
this
rendered
it
very
drinkable
i
drank
my
half
of
the
growler
no
problem
free
state
is
on
my
radar
hope
to
visit
the
brewpub
someday
the
body
was
full
and
well
rounded
not
heavy
and
very
smooth
drinkability
was
great
if
available
to
me
this
would
be
a
regular
quaff
overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
visit
kansas
dnot
a
bad
beer
but
this
one
was
a
bit
too
boring
for
me
i
found
nothing
exceptional
about
it
a
good
training
wheels
craft
beer
drinkability
is
fairly
high
with
good
flavors
d
this
is
a
very
good
alt
and
yet
another
good
brew
from
the
free
state
brewery
overall
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
at
free
state
its
a
real
smooth
easy
drinking
award
winning
beer
draught
mine
poured
a
clear
amber
color
that
was
tinged
with
red
it
had
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
that
left
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
bit
weak
while
still
nice
it
was
somewhat
malty
and
a
bit
grassy
the
taste
was
much
better
a
decent
maly
body
without
any
real
sweetness
a
bit
of
a
roastiness
to
it
with
a
hint
of
coffee
a
fair
amount
of
biterness
to
it
this
is
really
a
decent
brew
most
drinkable
taste
was
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
citurs
and
nut
good
finish
wanted
more
as
astra
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
not
a
lot
there
to
overwhelm
but
enough
to
make
it
interesting
dark

to

light

that
disappears
rather
quickly
nice
orange
aftertaste
to
go
along
with
initial
terrific
flavor
this
copper
hued
ale
was
the
first
to
be
brewed
in
kansas
since
the
wild
west
days
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
slight
sweet
edge
that
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
hops
perhaps
too
easy
drinking
on
a
monday
night
with
1
75
pints
on
tap
this
is
excellent
beer
a
good
beer
free
states
first
and
i
believe
possibly
the
first
beer
brewed
in
kansas
after
it
became
legal
again
a
good
one
to
try
and
probably
try
again
but
not
really
that
outstanding
clear
dark
reddishslightly
bronzy
hue
served
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
excellent
retention
laced
well
clean
nose
there
was
a
slight
dull
maltiness
disappointing
mute
invitation
moderately
flavorsome
palate
the
maltiness
is
the
focal
point
accomplished
the
hops
play
a
minor
supporting
rule
they
do
add
a
touch
of
bitterness
some
caramel
and
nut
hints
too
nicely
balanced
if
not
too
soft
modest
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
decent
enough
to

of

a

for

drinkers
just
to
bland
for
me
this
american
amber
ale
possesses
a
deep
amber
color
with
no
head
the
very
insignificant
aroma
is
slightly
of
malt
a
nice
smooth
heavier
body
supports
a
sharp
malt
sweetness
and
a
lingering
bitterness
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
harsh
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
a
latent
fruity
spice
helps
to
curb
it
some
dark
orange
copper
in
color

very
clear
impressive
thick
and

w

toasted
and
dark

malt
flavors
are
accompanied
by
moderate
hop
bitterness
the
medium
body
and
fairly
high
carbonation
make
this
brew
quite
effervescent
and
refreshing
the
finish
is
quite
dry
and
tannic
but
in
a
pleasant
way
ad
astra
is
an
all
around
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
a
style
that
isnt
brewed
enough
first
thoughts
wow
this
thing
is
dark
for
an
alt
which
in
my
opinion
is
a
style
of
beer
that
often
goes
overlooked
here
in
the
states
the
only
thing
i
am
sitting
here
wondering
about
is
if
victors
memoriale
is
really
an
altbier
why
did
i
get
so
much
yeast
flocculated
in
the
dregs
of
the
bottle
enough
nitpicking
though
this
beer
is
delicious
and
deceptively
strong
really
creeps
up
on
you
with
that
last
sip
overall
two
brothers
does
it
againthis
is
a
great
alethe
flavor
is
dynamic
and
well
roundedi
know
that
theres
a
bit
higher
abv
here
but
its
not
overly
dominate
like
some
in
this
rangemalts
and
hops
balance
so
nicelythis
beer
is
absolutely
perfect
while
watching
tom
brady
do
his
thing
versus
well
anybodygreat
beer
hope
i
find
another
before
its
gone45
o
consistent
from
start
to
finish
this
was
truly
one
of
the
highlights
of
my
holiday
vacation
therefore
i
went
next
door
to
a
local
wine
shop
and
grabbed
a
bottle
to
bring
back
to
dc
to
share
at
a
future
tasting
i
havent
explored
the
altbier
style
much
so
thought
id
give
this
one
a
go
it
is
smooth
balanced
easy
drinking
and
has
some
flavor
i
think
it
is
pretty
well
tostyle
it
is
definitely
not
complex
or
boundary
pushing
but
it
is
a
tasty
balanced
well
made
beer
as
it
warms
the
toasted
malt
character
becomes
more
dominant
to
its
advantage
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
moderate
to
moderatelight
carbonation
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
enough
carbonic
pep
to
make
this
move
across
the
palate
smoothly
and
easily
closes
rather
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
around
the
lips
not
as
good
as
the
sticke
brews
from
germany
but
it
is
close
very
well
done
i
wanna
see
if
we
can
get
a
count
of
the
number
of
new
portmanteau
words
coined
by
brewers
over
the
years
for
their
beers
names
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
deep
garnet
topped
by
a
fingerandahalf
of
sandy
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
earthy
greens
toffee
tea
and
a
kiss
of
clove
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
tea
dry
caramel
light
earthy
greens
light
brown
sugar
minerals
and
a
splash
of
cola
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
feel
overall
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
alt
though
it
did
at
times
come
to
resemble
a
dark
mild
that
had
been
mixed
with
a
cola
still
not
a
bad
combination
in
practice
22oz

poured

dark

topped

a
bubbly
ivory

that
holds

are

faint

nice

allowing
flavors
to

the
palate
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
for
its
uniqueness
i
wish
this
was
a
year
rounder
or
at
least
a
seasonal
offering
very
well
crafted
found
a
bottle
of
this
in
indianapolis
no
date
on
the
bottle
so
i
have
no
idea
how
old
it
is
yeah
overprimed
smelled
like
fermented
milk
the
appearance
was
nice
very
dark
with
red
hughes
tasted
awful
perhaps
it
was
good
when
fresh
but
nasty
now
what
i
would
like
to
drink
on
a
farm
after
a
hard
day
f
pretty
bitter
on
the
finish
with
more
earthy
spicy
hops
pretty
dry
but
maintains
a
good
malty
sweetness
feel
and
a
slight
syrupy
feel
the
sour
flavors
linger
only
long
enough
for
the
long
bitterness
to
seem
to
take
over
and
ride
out
the
finish
d
this
is
a
good
beer
i
enjoy
drinking
the
brothers
ebels
brews
great
ruby
amber
color
beneath
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
nothing
you
can
barely
see
the
bubbles
in
this
dark
ruby
beer
the
aroma
is
an
awesome
fruity
nutty
toasted
malt
extavaganza
the
taste
starts
with
a
toasted
plum
with
maybe
some
brown
sugar
the
middle
mixes
in
some
hazelnuts
that
move
to
very
grainy
but
still
pleasantly
sweet
nice
mouthfeel
that
is
grainy
sweet
and
very
well
carbonated
great
integration
ofthe
abv
too
a
session
beer
in
flavor
and
palate
but
the
abv
makes
that
pretty
unadvisable
this
is
my
favorite
alt
style
beer
to
date
its
a
relatively
straight
forward
beer
that
can
be
sipped
or
sessioned
i
was
blown
away
by
this
overall
i
think
i
may
have
found
my
new
favorite
style
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
most
complex
beers
i
have
had
in
years
hands
down
this
was
great
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
minimal
tan
head
aroma
is
nice
with
caramal
chocolate
and
dark
dried
fruits
dominant
the
taste
was
more
roasted
than
the
smell
with
a
fair
hop
balance
mainly
in
the
background
there
is
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
in
the
finish
but
it
isnt
overpowering
all
in
all
a
very
solid
beer
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
several
of
them
on
a
hot
summers
night
would
like
to
see
how
this
one
does
after
being
sat
down
for
about
1218
months
drinkability
a
great
beer
for
a
cooler
day
i
was
excited
to
try
and
consumed
on
a
warmer
day
the
roasted
notes
and
thick
mouthfeel
were
a
bit
much
for
summer
in
chicago
i
def
want
some
of
these
around
for
fall
and
will
be
putting
a
few
away
for
a
nice
cool
day
of
watching
college
football
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
and
served
in
a
shaker
this
beer
poured
a
deep
dark
mahogany
brown
hue
with
a
thin
head
of
tan
foam
that
quickly
faded
into
a
lasting
ring
some
clingy
lace
was
left
around
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
made
up
of
toasted
caramel
light
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
some
fruit
the
flavor
consisted
of
bittersweet
chocolate
lightly
bitter
roasted
malts
caramelized
sugar
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
fullbodied
with
minimal
carbonation
different
and
a
little
unusual
way
over
the
top
for
the
style
but
thats
what
the
brewer
intended
this
is
my
first
altbier
so
i
didnt
really
no
what
to
expect
from
the
style
but
this
one
is
a
well
crafted
tasty
enjoyable
brew
very
light
feeling
despite
its
robust
flavor
profile
easy
to
drink
something
i
could
have
once
in
a
while
one
bomber
is
the
perfect
serving
size
pours
a
dark
mahogony
with
a
full
one
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
behind
smell
is
a
musty
oak
and
new
leather
scent
hints
of
caramel
malt
and
some
dark
fruits
in
the
nose
as
well
there
also
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
pepper
and
spice
too
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
sweet
potato
flavor
up
front
with
molasses
on
the
tongue
as
well
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
finds
its
way
in
the
flavor
but
doesnt
take
away
from
the
overall
complexity
leather
makes
another
appearance
in
the
taste
with
an
almost
almond
like
nuttiness
in
the
aftertaste
somewhat
slick
feel
with
a
medium
body
warming
alchol
flavor
towards
the
end
such
an
interesting
brew
with
the
few
ive
had
of
this
style
this
one
is
easily
the
best
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
hopefully
more
breweries
will
attempt
this
style
drinkability
i
unfortunately
only
picked
up
one
bomber
of
this
while
in
illinois
and
am
now
disappointed
i
didnt
get

this

drinks
very

mouthfeel
is
very
thick

glazing
meaty
rich
and
long
on
the
mouth
which
translates
well
into
the
overall
taste
nutty
and
burnt
biscuit
like

do
also
develop

a

recommended
victors
memoriale
altbier
cant
touch
the
excellence
of
the

altbiers
but
its
one
of
the
best
american
alts
that
ive
ever
had
only
heavyweight
stickenjab
r
i
p
and
victory
ten
years
alt
can
compare
this
is
a
worthy
member
of
the
two
brothers
artisan
beer
series
and
was
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
dnotes
i
think
attenuation
is
the
big
issue
here
those
strong
flavor
characteristics
need
some
more
alone
time
and
a
reduction
in
sweetness
would
help
in
terms
of
drinkability
the
beer
poured
a
colabrown
color
with
a
tan
longlasting
head
great
biscuity
malt
aroma
and
flavor
with
just
enough
hops
and
roast
grain
bitterness
to
balance
the
dryness
helped
offset
the
weight
that
must
have
gone
along
with
all
that
malt
making
it
an
easy
drinker
out
in
the
summer
heat
and
sun
no
idea
that
it
was
nearly
8
abv
until
i
looked
at
the
stats
on
the
beer
here
before
i
posted
maybe
if
theres
enough
of
an
outcry
we
can
get
jason
to
brew
this
one
again
like
we
did
with
cane
ebel
last
swigs
a
porter
meets
altbier
but
an
altbier
in
the
end
now
if
i
could
only
remember
where
this
bottle
came
from
clocking
in
at
7
8
abv
is
impressive
d
the
full
mouthfeel
and
higher
abv
leave
me
content
with
the
one
bomber
that
i
have
the
bier
is
quite
good
however
a
mustsee
for
fans
of
the
alt
style
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
tan
head
over
the
clear
burgundy
brew
head
holds
well
with
ample
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
of
dark
malty
and
fruitiness
taste
starts
with
fruity
roastiness
goes
a
bit
dry
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
hints
of
hoppiness
as
it
warms
the
nuttiness
comes
out
and
balances
the
fruit
well
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
okay
but
this
one
just
doesnt
come
together
well
for
me
the
late
arrival
nuttiness
helps
though
the
taste
is
molasses
and
more
dark
malts
with
a
somewhat
nutty
finish
reminds
me
of
hazelnuts
and
almonds
unfortunately
its
not
too
drinkable
with
this
high
abv
and
resultant
sticky
sweetness
still
one
of
the
better
alts
ive
tried
very
good
this
is
a
tasty
well
balanced
beer
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
dubble
i
thought
the
appearance
was
a
bit
flat
and
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
otherwise
a
great
brew
drinkability
very
nice
a
new
style
for
me
ill
be
out
on
the
hunt
for
the
next
opportunity
for
this
the
7
8
is
hidden
from
the
one
of
the
best
alts
ive
had
very
well
done
pours
a
hazy
brown
some
red

thin
tan

nice

settles

bit

solid

in
the

mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
low
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
hidden
shows
itself
as
some
fruitiness
nice
shot
at
doing
an
8
altbier
this
works
pretty
well
doesnt
come
across
as
too
big
for
the
style
d
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
mouthfeel
is
super
with
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
and
thickness
to
balance
each
other
out
as
previously
noted
abv
isnt
apparent
making
this
a
deadly
drinkable
beer
the
ebels
appear
to
be
the
real
deal
if
they
were
to
focus
solely
on
the
beers
that
make
up
their
seasonalartisan
roster
i
have
little
doubt
they
could
become
a
phenomenon
quite
dark
brown
with
a
deceent
head
but
one
that
dissipates
quickly
there
are
aromas
of
rye
an
undefined
graininess
mint
and
some
sweet
maltiness
toward
the
end
really
nice
flavors
here
with
lightly
toasted
grain
some
bitter
hops
in
the
background
and
some
nice
bubblegum
flavors
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
has
good
body
but
its
a
little
grainy
and
perhaps
a
tad
heavy
for
the
style
very
drinkable
just
delicious
in
the
u
s
just
rivaled
by
the
10
year
alt
from
victory
it
pours
a
coffee
brown
with
a
very
minimal
head
less
than
a
cm
aroma
is
light
pleasant
and
toffeeish
flavor
is
slightly
sour
and
heavily
caramely
more
like
a
bock
than
i
expected
the
sourness
seems
slightly
off
to
me
and
i
must
say
that
the
mouthfeel
is
overcarbonated
which
is
odd
given
the
small
amount
of
head
when
i
poured
it
this
beer
is
also
sticky
in
your
mouth
which
in
my
opinion
is
consistent
with
the
style
still
i
must
say
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
flavor
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
this
beer
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
its
worth
a
try
nice
alt
very
drinkable
smooth
as
a
whistle
and
not
as
chewy
as
i
like
my
alts
again
there
is
the
cola
with
a
tobacco
hint
some
dates
as
well
as
prune
dark
yeasy
breads
lacking
depth
of
mouthfeel
but
has
a
finesse
too
it
that
is
unmatched
this
one
pours
a
nice
medium
to
dark
brown
purists
would
say
its
too
dark
they
would
probably
also
call
this
a
dopplesticke
as
it
is
rather
strong
i
didnt
get
much
a
head
with
my
pour
but
what
foam
was
generated
seem
to
last
leaving
some
thick
lace
the
body
is
just
about
right
medium
with
a
smooth
as
satin
mouthfeel
the
malt
flavor
seems
predominant
with
burnt
caramel
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
just
little
bits
though
the
bitterness
at
the
finish
is
solid
and
nicely
assertive
overall
one
of
the
two
brothers
best
offerings
so
far
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
slightly
oily
feel
medium
carbonation
i
have
really
enjoyed
every
two
brothers
beer
i
have
tried
good

and

with
a

the
taste
up

is
that
of

caramel
and
nougat
even
with
the
34
ibus
this
is
a
malt
dominated
beer
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
either
the
hops
add
balance
to
this
beer
and
a
little

the
finish

at

av
this
is
quite
a

as
uerige
but
this
stuff
is
pretty
damn
good

is

this
one
goes
down

is

i
could
get
myself
into
trouble
drinking
this
one
i
imagine
im
sitting
here
kicking
myself
for
only
buying
one
bottle
its
time
to
go
pick
up
some
more
one
of
the
best
altbiers
i
have
ever
sampled
cheers
to
the
memory
of
victor

everyone
at

overall
im
thrilled
to
see
an
american
craft
brewer
attempting
a
sticke
altbier
while
ive
only
had
a
few
other
varietals
and
im
using
zum
uerige
as
the
standard
this
seems
a
bit
too
malty
to
fit
the
style
a
more
pronounced
noble
hop
presence
along
with
a
slightly
thinner
body
would
put
this
in
the
same
league
as
anything
from
duesseldorf
style
guidelines
aside
the
beer
is
delicious
i
would
almost
categorize
it
as
an
ale
equivalent
of
a
doppelbock
its
not
going
to
displace
zum
uerige
sticke
in
my
cellar
but
a
wonderful
offering
in
its
own
right
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
belies
its
7

d
this
beer
has
a
smooth

light

even
though
it
has

at

certainly
its
a

rare
style
in
my
neck
of
the

which
is
a
shame
i
drank
the
hell
out
of
all
the
alts
i
could
find
when
i
was
going
to
school
in

in
the

and

i
could
find

i

pretty

altbier
not

but
not

again
o
easy
to

and
enjoyable
reminds
me
of
a
visit
to
dortmund
a
couple
of
years
ago
where
i
enjoyed
quite
a
few
of
these
nice
flavors
and
aromas
pretty
true
to
the
style
in
my
opinion
nice

and

taste
is
nice
lightly
toasty
faintly
caramelly
bread
crust
sweetness
a
nice
gently
dominant
toastywoodygrassy
bitterness
its
dryish
but
with
noticeable
sweetness
and
bitterness
and
an
excellent
characterful
session
beer
as
a
good
alt
should
be
i
used
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
years
ago
i
still
like
it
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
thin
persistent
light
tan
head
with
some
lacing
mellow
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
light
wheat
fortunately
the
skunky
whiff
i
got
when
opening
the
bottle
was
not
present
in
the
aroma
from
the
glass
green
bottle
why
do
they
do
this
flavor
of
caramel
and
bready
malt
finishes
with
light
grassy
hops
and
a
long
hop
and
malt
aftertaste
starts
slightly
sweet
and
finishes
slightly
dry
guess
i
got
a
bottle
of
this
soon
enough
that
the
skunk
had
not
affected
taste
all
flavors
are
pleasant
but
very
low
key
and
unmemorable
light
to
medium
bodied
definitely
would
consider
this
as
a
pleasant
dinner
beer
but
would
never
buy
it
again
if
it
is
in
a
green
bottle
not
worth
taking
the
chance
it
suprised
me
by
not
totally
sucking
o
an
interesting
altbier
with
the
dryness
and
the
nettles
rjt
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
taste
might
have
suffered
a
bit
as
a
result
of
the
long
trip
across
the
pond
and
the
green
bottle
o
this
one
might
be
one
for
those
that
like
their
beers
ending
with
a
bitter
kick
o
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
around
as
an
altbier
this
doesnt
have
too
much
to
offer
an
overmarketed
average
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
brown
color
with
medium
head
aroma
was
very
nice
sweet
floral
and
herbal
taste
was
mostly
sweet
malts
with
a
light
herbal
hop
finish
although
on
the
whole
this
was
a
disappointingly
weak
beer
very
light
with
decent
carbonation
the
palate
was
surprising
for
something
thats
supposed
to
be
in
the
altbier
realm
also
had
a
weak
hop
profile
compared
to
other
alts
mouthfeel
felt
like
an
altbier
at
the
onset
but
the
hops
were
a
bit
of
a
surprise
not
unpleasant
just
a
little
unexpected
grade
one
thumb
up
beer
wouldnt
kill
to
have
it
again
although
i
wouldnt
avoid
it
at
all
costs
good
beer
to
try
balanced
and
pleasant
dnothing
i
would
search
for
but
if
you
come
across
it
i
would
give
it
a
try
just
so
you
can
say
you
have
had
one
d
very
drinkable
but
difficult
to
place
at
times
it
seems
to
be
a
bitter
then
an
altbier
still
this
qualifies
as
a
solid
effort
a
good
beer
with
a
kind
of
hardcore
oldschool
vibe
its
easy
to
imagine
this
beer
being
just
like
this
in
1893
you
know
untouched
by
time
and
trend
and
all
that
very
good
beer
wish
i
could
drink
this
more
often
a
natural
tasting
and
spicy
beer
very
aromatic
indeed
like
an
altbier
only
with
a
little
less
fruitiness
akin
to
an
english
bitter
as
well
drinkability
this
went
very
well
with
my
meal
and
seemed
as
if
it
would
go
well
with
any
meat
dish
it
also
was
smooth
and
interesting
enough
to
make
me
want
it
back
as
a
regular
back
in
new
york
d
has
the
drinkability
of
any
good
german
lager
plus
this
one
has
that
extra
taste
complexity
that
i
really
enjoyed
d
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
have
more
of
this
d
i
really
did
feel
i
was
drinking
a
cross
between
an
80
shilling
and
an
altbier
all
the
roasted
malt
characteristics
of
these
2
styles
with
a
firm
body
nice
but
metallic
quality
puts
me
off
wanting
another
the
beer
poured
a
clear
red
amber
color
with
tall
very
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
nice
with
some
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
noble
hops
the
taste
was
richly
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
hoppiness
was
modest
up
front
but
became
stronger
toward
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
it
was
malty
with
a
good
hoppy
finish
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
this
beer
its
a
nice
welldeveloped
flavor
without
being
heavy
kind
of
reminiscent
of
an
altbier
in
that
respect
md
i
tend
to
agree
with
the
last
reviewer
paterlodie
that
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
welllagered
filtered
altbier
than
a
naturally
murky
kellerbier
while
sigmunds
comment
also
hits
the
bulls
eye
that
the
moderate
level
of
hop
bitterness
seems
to
well
balance
the
mixed
maltiness
the
finish
is
slightly
sticky
rather
than
consistently
clean
but
overall
this
mediumbodied
and
lightly
fizzy
bitter
amber
beer
is
definitely
a
thirstquencher
if
only
the
brewery
used
real
hops
rather
than
hop
extract
bb

nice

and
with

imo
more

with
that

nowhere

a

not

i
kind
of
expected
a

but
the

is
actually
very
moderate
still
some
hops
are

and
they
are
quite
well

with
the

of

a

o
this
beer
is
a
bit
watery
with
some
nice
malt
hints
but
also
taste
like
it
is
a
bit
old
oa
bland
boring
beer
other
altbiers
long
trails
were
more
complex
but
this
one
brought
very
little
to
the
table
overall
a
solid
sessionable
amber
not
a
beer
i
would
go
for
every
day
but
certainly
once
a
month
it
has
a
wonderful
combination
of
toasted
malt
and
earthiness
another
middle
of
the
road
offering
from
tyranena
mouth
feel
is
light
but
still
has
some
smoothness
it
also
coats
the
tongue
oits
ok
not
anything
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
definitely
wouldnt
turn
one
down
trying
the
headless
amber
alt
from
tyranena
the
beer
is
v
ery
interesting
at
least
for
me
the
beer
is
clear
rich
amber
in
color
and
the
decent
carbonation
forms
a
nice
thin
head
which
seems
to
be
lacing
nicely
the
smell
is
sweet
belgium
maltsugar
the
taste
includes
an
earthy
zest
almost
comes
across
with
a
coffee
bean
zest
there
is
definite
malt
and
hint
of
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
at
5
abv
it
has
a
huge
flavor
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
if
you

good

overall
i
think
it
is
a
very
solid
altbier
havent
had
one
in
years
and
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
and
you
could
definitely
session
this
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
cheers
overall
a
drinkable
malty
session
beer
its
ok
overall
clearly
a
bit
flawed
with
the
lingering
sourness
but
it
almost
adds
a
little
something
that
would
otherwise
be
missing
overall
not
bad
i
am
not
really
sure
one
would
look
for
this
one
in
any
way
but
you
really
cannot
complain
too
much
about
it
overall
i
give
this
one
props
as
a
fine
session
ale
enjoyable
and
well
balanced
it
is
tasty
and
easy
drinking
but
not
a
beer
to
rave
about
finally
my
first
altbier
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
white
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aromas
are
very
sweet
im
picking
up
a
lot
of
malt
with
light
yeast
there
is
also
some
dark
fruit
apparent
the
taste
too
is
of
sweet
maltiness
it
has
a
little
fruityness
to
it
but
theyre
hard
to
define
its
kind
of
like
a
potpourri
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
isnt
too
bad
it
isnt
too
good
either
this
seems
like
a
wannabe
belgian
it
definitely
doesnt
seem
german
this
one
is
average
at
best
ill
have
to
try
the
uerige
sticke
next
i
liked
the
mellow
blend
fruit
and
sweetness
here
and
the
body
helped
keep
this
approachable
but
the
hop
profile
just
seemed
to
come
get
in
the
way
a
bit
too
much
leaving
this
with
an
unbalanced
feel
overall
this
is
an
interesting
alt
for
sure
id
be
willing
to
give
it
another
look
sometime
another
beer
thanks
to
my
brothers
random
buying
habits
lovin
it
it

by

nose

mild
toffee
very
light
buttery
biscuits
light
greens
and
a
hint
of
orange

its
all
meek
and
ineffective
the
taste
holds
notes
of
grass
wheat
light
orange
peel
very
light
buttery
biscuits
and
greens
with
all
the
meekness
this
beer
must
be
inheriting
a
larger
portion
of
the
earth
than
others
not
only
is
it
mild
though
but
its
overly
grassy
and
leafy
with
nothing
else
going
on
kinda
odd
if
you
ask
me
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
justundermoderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
sad
beer
one
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
accomplish
anything
but
disappointing
all
of
the
tyranena
beers
have
good
names
artwork
and
stories
on
the
bottles
and
this
one
is
no
different
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
all
in
all
this
brew
was
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
semi
creamy
texture
nothing
special
but
enjoyable
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
i
wish
i
could
describe
the
taste
and
smell
better
but
i
dont
get
very
much
pours
a
moderate
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
and
some
mild
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
some
mild
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
bread
the
taste
doesnt
bring
much
morea
bit
of
dough
caramel
and
toffee
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
decent
depth
drinks
okay
but
not
a
terribly
eventful
beer
drinkability
im
not
crazy
about
this
beer
its
something
different
and
it
has
that
trademark
tyranena
fun
about
it
but
im
not
sure
id
purchase
this
again
maybe
its
the
style
d
pretty
quaffable
i
find
german
style
beers
improve
by
the
second
or
third
glass
and
i
can
see
this
happening
here
its
nice
to
see
a
bottled
american
altbier
around
precisely
because
i
love
drinking
them
over
the
long
term
this
ones
fine
it
scratches
the
itch
but
doesnt
blow
me
away
overall
drinkable
though
one
of
the
weaker
tyranena
brews
that
ive
had
highly
sessionable
headless
man
is
a
smooth
wellbalanced
altbier
with
a
refreshing
thirstquenching
drinkability
d
unlike
most
beers
from
this
company
i
cannot
really
recommend
this
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
overly
exciting
and
the
dry
bitter
flavor
is
just
a
bit
much
for
me
and
this
style
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
lightly
dry
finish
dvery
easy
drinking
nice
sipper
from
tyranena
really
not
a
ton
of
complexity
just
a
simple
beer
to
sip
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
for
free
but
there
are
more
worthy
brews
to
be
had
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
the
excellent
flavor
followed
by
a
low
abv
makes
this
a
brew
you
could
session
during
the
summer
months
an
excellent
brew
from
tyranena
d
a
decent
beer
with
some
basic
flavors
easy
enough
to
drink
enjoy
d
this
is
an
easytodrink
tasty
sessionable
beer
recommended
d
a
nice
redamber
ale
for
spring
i
would
drink
this
again
however
i
think
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
of
beer
i
liked
this
one
i
can
see
having
a
few
of
these
dmeh
i
like
other
alt
beers
i
had
but
im
not
sure
how
drinkable
this
one
is
on
an
overall
experience
d
good
very
drinkable
almost
sessionable
though
i
believe
this
is
more
of
a
result
of
crafting
this
beer
for
mass
appeal
more
than
anything
else
this
was
not
fantastic
by
any
means
but
a
nice
good
consistent
beer
its
an
everyday
beer
dont
expect
to
impress
people
with
this
one
on
par
with
leinenkugels
amber
picked
up
a
single
at
princeton
liquors
in
maple
grove
for
about
2
the
beer
has
a
tall
light
tan
head
with
a
hazy
amberred
body
the
flavor
is
akin
to
a
typical
dry
red
ale
with
a
fair
share
of
hops
the
malt
provide
a
mild
toffee
and
dried
date
the
hops
quickly
kick
in
after
the
malt
with
grapefruit
and
orange
rind
flavor
that
offers
a
nice
balance
to
the
barley
oddly
enough
the
aroma
remind
me
of
a
sugar
cookie
with
dark
bread
notes
no
hint
of
hops
all
in
all
a
decent
and
dry
amber
that
about
as
hoppy
as
your
average
pale
ale
but
with
richer
malt
character
the
overall
feel
is
almost
astringent
with
the
combination
of
hop
bitterness
and
dry
malts
but
its
otherwise
very
drinkable
pours
a
nice
hazy
red
color
maybe
some
orange
a
little
lighter
than
red
with
a
decent
1
cm
head
it
falls
back
kind
of
quickly
leaving
a
bit
of
a
ring
which
leaves
only
a
bit
of
lacing
decent
looking
a
little
more
clarity
would
be
nice
the
smell
is
pretty
good
and
interesting
caramelly
toastiness
comes
up
front
something
is
a
little
fruity
something
is
a
little
herbal
and
spicy
minty
a
bit
and
something
is
a
little
leafy
the
nice
breadiness
in
here
makes
this
one
interesting
i
really
love
the
taste
of
altbiers
i
think
its
an
amazing
blend
of
what
i
like
about
german
lagers
and
american
ales
the
malt
body
is
really
interesting
too
its
like
a
nice
nutty
bready
taste
with
this
minty
sugar
syrup
poured
on
top
of
it
i
really
like
it
it
tastes
fairly
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
fruity
flavors
i
like
the
graininess
too
that
isnt
a
flavor
that
comes
out
in
other
ale
styles
the
body
is
nice
medium
full
a
nice
rush
of
carbonation
and
a
little
bite
in
the
finish
the
drink
is
pretty
good
enjoyable
nice
and
light
a
bit
clean
the
flavors
are
nice
i
could
probably
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
and
i
find
that
to
be
quite
normal
with
the
style
d
im
not
really
enjoying
this
very
much
though
id
love
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
d
brewed
for
drinkability
this
beer
has
the
flavor
of
an
ale
with
the
mouthfeel
of
a
lager
while
being
complex
yet
sessionable
very
tasty
and
drinkable
i
would
partake
in
this
beer

time
its

not
have
the

like
to
see
more
of
appearance
is
a
copper

deep

color
i
dont
know
what
i
can
add
for
smell
or
atase
there
was
not
much
of
a
defining
characteristic
for
me
although
if
you
have
ever
had
ngs
alt
this
one
tyranenas
was
better
drinkability
was
pretty
good
d
pretty
easy
drinking
nothing
great
about
this
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
have
it
again
not
bad
not
great
mouthfeel
was
active
and
mouthfilling
carbonation
medium
to
light
body
solid
all
around
d
not
the
best
amber
or
alt
that
i
have
but
the
story
behind
it
is
pretty
nice
drinks
fairly
easy
a
pretty
good
alt
but
i
expected
more
from
these
guys
d
its
not
something
to
drink
all
night
have
one
early
in
the
evening
while
you
can
appreciate
it
and
its
complexity
almost
drinks
too
fast
and
lets
the
details
escape
you
d
this
a
pretty
solid
brew
overall
for
inexperienced
drinkers
this
one
maybe
a
little
harder
to
drink
because
of
the
bitterness
that
is
evident
in
this
beer
its
nice
to
see
a
domestic
brewer
crank
out
a
respectable
alt
even
though
i
felt
the
carbonation
was
a
little
high
its
still
worth
checking
out
my
first
experience
with
this
brewery
is
a
good
one
dark
golen
in
color
pretty
clear
which
this
style
should
be
a
nice
creamy
white
lace
great
nose
grainsmalt
and
a
herbal
hop
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
nice
clean
maltiness
accented
by
a
dry
herbal
hop
finish
maybe
a
little
too
hopped
up
for
my
liking
but
i
am
still
getting
to
know
this
style
definitely
finishes
on
a
dry
note
a
pretty
nice
little
brew
thanks
to
cokes
via
bighugey
for
the
beer
4
1bottle
d
pretty
complex
for
a
5
brew
drinkable
and
low
abv
d
nothing
outstanding
but
would
drink
again
if
offered
to
me
i
dont
think
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
for
this
beer
however
it
was
a
very
simple
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
those
that
like
redbrown
beers
paired
this
up
with
jasper
hill
bandagewrapped
cheddar
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
its
not
the
first
one
that
i
would
choose
in
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
dark
cloudy
amber
with
basically
no
head
the
smell
is
of
nuts
and
apricots
the
taste
is
ok
i
must
admit
i
am
not
an
altbier
fan
but
this
one
is
better
than
the
other
one
i
have
tasted
its
kind
of
like
you
are
going
to
get
a
big
citrusy
hop
bite
like
a
dipa
but
it
never
happens
and
the
flavor
fades
rather
fast
not
the
greatest
after
tastemouthfeel
after
you
swallow
and
its
a
drinkable
beer
just
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
attain
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
dvery
drinkable
and
a
good
summer
session
beer
but
as
a
a
tremendous
fan
of
this
brewery
this
is
the
first
one
im
not
a
big
fan
of
i
will
have
to
try
this
style
more
to
sanity
check
this
review

for
this
extra

into
a
teardrop
glass
deep
orangebrown
color
with
a
good
amount
of
haze
and
thick
head
with
an
aggressive
pour
not
much
on
the
nose
perhaps
some
caramel
and
malt
smooth
full
flavor
good
malt
backbone
with
a
lingering
sweet
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
but
another
fine
beer
from
this
brewery
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
there
is
a
good
level
of
carbonation
that
gives
a
little
bite
to
the
tongue
i
like
this
one
it
came
through
very
well
for
the
style
and
was
memorable
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
nice
little
creamy
tannish
head
nice
carbonation
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
very
slight
hop
and
some
caramel
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
the
finish
is
slightly
drybitter
medium
body
drinkable
i
like
this
one
glad
to
get
to
try
it
out
thanks
daniel
d
solid
amber
beer
thanks
to
beertracker
for
trying
to
get
me
to
warm
up
to
altbiers
pours
a
nice
amber
duh
color
with
near
perfect
clarity
absolutely
no
head
at
all
i
suppose
next
time
i
should
pour
harder
i
didnt
exactly
ease
it
into
the
glass
this
time
smells
of
light
german
malts
and
toffee
little
to
no
hops
present
however
hops
tingle
the
tongue
upon
tasting
as
it
warms
the
toffee
becomes
more
prominent
nice
earthiness
in
the
tail
end
with
some
light
malt
flavors
soft
spicey
hops
develop
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
easy
drinking
medium
bodied
beer
a
much
better
altbier
than
my
previous
experience
even
without
a
head
pours
a
deep
amber
in
color
moderate
carbonation
and
lacing
shows
up
as
well
smells
of
great
malts
caramel
some
subtle
fruits
some
toasted
bread
taste
brings
forth
a
good
hop
presence
somewhat
spicy
and
a
good
compliment
to
the
brew
mostly
about
the
malts
nice
silky
refreshing
mouthfeel
a
good
session
brew
if
i
do
say
so
myself
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
leaving
minimal
lacing
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
almost
nonexistent
there
was
a
slight
roasted
smell
of
malt
and
minimal
hints
of
earthy
tones
the
taste
is
of
mild
hops
and
rich
malts
there
is
a
good
balance
leaving
traces
of
the
bitterness
in
your
mouth
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
this
brew
is
decent
but
thats
all
not
enough
to
merit
going
out
and
buying
a
sixer
drinkability
a
good
wellbalanced
beer
and
a
real
quaff
sensation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
is
not
too
heavy
or
bold
but
smooth
and
refined
nicely
crafted
altbier
is
a
style
that
is
often
overlooked
and
tyranena
has
done
a
solid
job
at
creating
a
good
example
of
one
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
solid
cap
lots
of
sticky
lacing
coats
the
glass
a
very
attractive
beer
that
justs
exudes
quality
the
smells
are
faint
but
hints
of
sweet
malt
and
toffee
the
taste
is
just
that
as
a
sweet
malt
is
dominate
with
a
hint
of
toffee
it
leaves
a
creamy
coating
and
a
lightmedium
body
very
pleasant
all
around
and
a
low
abv
makes
this
a
easy
drinking
beer
definately
will
be
buying
this
again
when
in
need
of
a
lighter
tasting
sessionable
beer
pours
a
copperish
orange
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
somewhat
skunky
and
a
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
a
sweet
skunky
malt
just
like
it
smells
a
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
malty
aftertaste
ok
malty
and
kind
of
skunky
nothing
really
that
great
solid
alt
from
tyranena
probably
my
least
favorite
from
them
ive
tried
so
far
but
a
solid
example
nonetheless
the
only
reason
this
is
my
least
favorite
is
because
every
other
beer
from
tyranena
ive
sampled
has
been
from
really
good
to
spectacular
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
the
head
is
large
billowy
and
offwhite
in
color
the
aroma
is
of
malty
with
a
nice
caramel
and
floral
notes
but
is
rather
faint
the
taste
is
very
balanced
with
caramel
up
front
and
flower
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
again
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
plenty
of
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
alt
that
ends
up
being
quite
refreshing
too
overall
headless
man
is
a
tasty
brew
from
tyranena
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
regular
lineup
a
nice
session
beer
all
in
all
this
is
a
fine
ale
if
you
are
looking
for
bold
powerful
flavor
this
is
not
where
to
find
it
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pleasing
relaxing
and
refreshing
ale
please
sir
or
madam
drink
up
good
solid
beer
served
with
a
nice
full
head
and
plenty
of
lace
very
nice
reddish
color
mild
aroma
super
balanced
malty
caramely
and
a
little
dry
definitely
a
session
beer
good

mai
bock
drinkability
good
session
pick
props
to
jj21
for
this
sample
quite
enjoyable
a
very
clean
wellbrewed
ale
that
exemplifies
the
altbier
style
nicely
well
done
overall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
there
is
no
real
backbone
to
the
beer
very
light
for
the
style
there
is
also
little
to
no
head
or
lacing
it
drinks
decent
but
only
because
the
flavor
is
rather
weak
the
malt
has
a
decent
flavor
but
again
is
underdone
drinkability
overall
i
think
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
there
just
arent
any
tremendous
flavors
to
keep
me
here
too
long
12
ounce
bottle
thanks
afatty
not
overdone
in
any
way
and
all
the
better
for
it
just
a
solid
good
tasting
alt
thanks
to
ba
keffkrenner
for
the

da
good
session
brew
in
this
one
i
would
have
it
again
for
sure
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
would
make
great
sessioncrossover
fare
im
sure
ill
be
enjoying
this
one
again
sometime
pours

fades
to
a

nose
starts
off
with
a
blast
of
metalliccopperrust
grainy
malt
caramel
and
toasted
nuts
if
theres
such
a
thing
as
a
nut
bomb
this
is
it
nuttier
than
most
nut
browns
ive
tried
along
with
loads
of
breadycaramel
sweet
malt
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
crisply
carbonated

but
silky

in
the
mouth
this
is
a
hell
of
a
drinker
plenty

again
this
beer
is

so
if
thats
not
your
thing
well
youve
been
warned
otherwise
seek
this

winner
from

mills
drinkability
sessionable
while
its
hard
to
say
that
anything
really
standsout
to
make
this
beer
exceptional
it
might
be
slightly
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
certainly
a
quality
beer
quite
drinkable
and
i
highly
recommend
it
try
pairing
this
with
brats
or
pork
for
a
special
treat

decent

cloying
with

in
the

but
well
hopped
bitter

clean
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
doesnt
seem
to
fit
too
well
in
the
style
but
im
no
alt
expert
so
what
the
hay
ill
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
drinkability
oh
you
could
throw
back
about
fifteen
of
these
but
you
still
wouldnt
get
much
character
an
altbier
is
apparently
an
aged
brown
ale
but
this
is
definitely
amberred
territory
pours
a
rich
golden
amber
color
with
a
very
fizzy
yellow
head
aroma
is
caramel
malts
and
noble
german
hops
spicy
like
taste
is
doughy
and
bread
like
up
front
there
is
some
definite
nuttiness
to
the
taste
as
well
some
hop
bite
is
apparent
at
the
end
again
its
a
spicy
noble
hop
presence
there
is
somewhat
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
present
to
this
beer
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
not
too
light
a
great
session
brew
here
not
sure
how
stylistically
sound
this
example
is
as
it
is
my
first
but
i
will
now
definitely
explore
pours
out
to
a
dark
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
moderatesized
head
aroma
is
that
of
biscuit
dough
and
malt
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
residual
light
sweetness
on
the
swallow
this
would
be
a
good
thirst
quencher
on
a
warm
day
thanks
to
fantome
for
the
offering
this
beer
pours
out
a
clear
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
the
flavor
is
caramel
malt
with
some
tangy
fruitiness
there
is
not
much
complexity
to
the
flavor
but
it
is
still
tasty
a
little
hop
bitterness
but
the
flavor
is
mainly
malt
i
would
like
this
beer
more
if
it
were
a
little
more
crisp
decent
drinkability
dark
amber
color
faint
malt
aroma
little
or
no
head
slight
malt
sweetness
along
with
the
taste
of
yeast
or
some
adjunct
rather
thin
on
the
palate
i
think
i
had
this
on
tap
once
and
it
was
a
little
better
but
for
the
time
being
im
going
to
pass
on
the
bottles
drinkability
ummm
not
a
great
beer
that
offers
a
hell
of
a
lot
but
yet
it
is
an
easy
drinker
that
goes
down
not
half
bad
make
sense
i
didnt
think
so
im
up
in
the
air
over
this
one
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
12
of
light
beige
head
over
the
orangeyhoney
hued
brew
a
little
light
in
color
for
what
i
would
expect
from
an
alt
but
the
lacing
is
okay
aroma
is
minimal
and
what
is
present
is
reasonably
neutral
with
some
apple
or
fruit
notes
taste
is
caramel
malt
tempered
with
some
crisp
fruity
flavors
similar
to
the
nose
not
sure
if
its
what
i
think
an
alt
should
be
but
standing
on
its
own
merits
its
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
even
better
clear
medium
amber
appearance
nice
head
of
sustainable
14
inch
foam
after
about
30
seconds
simple
lace
slipping
strings
on
the
glass
malty
aroma
candied
apple
and
malted
milk
with
slight
esters
mouthfeel
is
shy
of
medium
but
sub
creamy
flavor
is
welltempered
and
laid
out
sort
of
unfolding
like
a
ball
of
caramel
rolling
down
a
caramel
hill
looked
for
more
hopping
just
a
slight
sense
of
pepper
and
a
nut
skin
sense
give
an
impression
of
bittering
a
very
pleasant
beer
in
drinkability
i
just
get
more
snap
from
some
alts
and
theres
a
bit
of
ragged
texture
here
at
the
end
of
the
glass
that
takes
away
from
its
initial
smoothness
an
old
headless
cheers
to
bighuge
for
this
one
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
but
the
chalkiness
on
the
finish
distracts
nice
level
of
carbonation
a
very
nice
beer
for
a
session
but
would
be
excellent
if
a
bit
better
balanced

generous
with

first
with
a
malty
beginning

dry
and
flowery
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
punches
in

the

a

thanks
jeffboo
lacy
white
head
and
a
nice
pale
amber
color
citrusy
and
nut
aromas
are
most
evident
sweetness
is
very
prevalent
in
the
taste
with
a
nice
hop
bite
near
the
finish
finish
itself
is
rather
dry
with
a
slight
roasted
character
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
out
there
this
medium
bodied
alt
style
brew
presents
with
a
rich
copper
color
and
creamy
offwhite
head
german
yeast
and
bready
hops
control
the
aroma
the
creamy
body
and
sweet
malts
are
balanced
very
well
by
a
strong
but
not
overpowering
hop
presence
quite
a
good
beer
this
beer
is
a
perfect
copper
shade
with
a
thin
tan
head
a
hugely
sweet
caramel
maltiness
is
dominant
on
the
nose
pretty
nice
taste
is
predominantly
malt
this
is
definitely
not
on
the
high
side
of
the
spectrum
for
hop
rates
in
an
alt
it
has
a
really
nice
clean
malty
taste
different
from
a
malty
bock
taste
though
this
is
more
toasty
and
non
complex
very
mellow
tasting
as
it
should
be
from
the
extended
cold
lagering
that
this
ale
undergoes
and
if
anything
the
hops
that
are
used
add
a
touch
of
dryness
to
the
finish
quite
a
solid
altbier
i
am
glad
to
have
it
around
as
it
is
my
beer
of
choice
in
just
about
any
situation
i
likely
drink
this
more
than
any
other
single
beer
as
it
is
my
goto
session
brew
not
bad
but
really
not
special
at
all
generic
even
for
these
guys
who
usually
do
pretty
well
with
flavor
in
conventional
styles
this
one
is
a
bit
watered
down
for
me
not
a
whole
lot
of
the
rich
caramel
german
malt
i
like
in
the
style
and
its
not
lagered
yet
i
think
it
has
a
pretty
similar
grain
base
to
the
marzen
beers
of
the
season
usually
i
would
be
all
for
that
but
it
just
has
not
much
flavor
and
it
finishes
with
a
strange
metallic
tang
that
obviously
doesnt
belong
i
do
get
a
hint
of
citrus
there
and
then
the
bittering
hops
on
top
of
the
grain
but
the
whole
thing
is
just
too
light
for
my
tastes
especially
this
time
of
year
carbonation
is
on
point
but
it
has
no
body
and
that
hurts
it
for
me
the
ale
yeast
adds
nothing
and
im
left
pretty
underwhelmed
on
the
whole
from
12
oz
bottle
this
has
got
to
be
the
brightest
beer
i
have
ever
seen
pours

this
is
why
we
drink
beer
to
taste
the
good
varieties
and
interesting
beers
that
celebrate
special
times
of
the
year
and
to
relax
in
our
work
this
oktoberfest
is
another
great
example
of
a
beer
you
can
enjoy
and
savor
the
flavors
of
autumn
a
good
choice
for
the
style
initially
surprised
by
the
ale
in
a
lager
dominated
specialty
nice
color
and
great
mouth
feel
but
after
that
it
fads
ill
stick
to
lagers
for
octoberfest
overall
well
done
and
appropriate
to
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
lot
easy
to
drink
and
inoffensive
as
they
come
everyone
should
give
this
one
a
go
horrible
stuff
i
realize
this
is
an
older
bottle
but
it
should
have
held
up
better
than
this
alas
im
reviewing
this
because
i
feel
that
even
in
its
freshest
stages
does
it
retain
these
off
flavors
throughout
am
i
crazy
or
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
or
something
not
anything
id
want
to
revist
again
and
i
could
definitely
say
the
same
for
most
of
widmers
beers
at
this
point
more
caramel
and
fruits
than
expected
not
really
a
classic
altbier
but
still
an
ok
beer
this
was
a
good
value
at
about
7
50
a
sixer
despite
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
as
fresh
as
it
could
be
overall
pretty
good
american
version
of
an
oktober
fest
beer
and
a
little
surprising
coming
from
widmer
bros
whos
beers
tend
to
be
much
hoppier
than
this
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
this
one
is
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
o
i
was
looking
for
a
seasonal
brew
to
get
me
pumped
for
halloween
something
better
than
the
tried
and
true
sam
adams
seasonal
fare
this
was
not
the
beer
i
was
looking
for
maybe
i
can
hand
it
out
with
the
candy
this
coming
thursday
to
the
parents
pours
a
pretty
burnt
orange
in
color
with
a
1finger
off
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
good
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
some
caramel
spice
and
hops
very
nice
the
taste
was
the
same
and
much
better
than
other
oktober
brews
i
have
tried
very
smooth
actually
and
went
down
easy
the
malts
are
certainly
the
focal
point
in
this
one
with
the
hops
doing
a
good
job
of
adding
some
complimentary
notes
in
the
finish
a
well
done
example
of
a
tasty
maltforward
beer

this
beer
its

great

and

lol
seriously
though
this
is
a
impressive
oktoberfest
beer
in
the
mix
of
contenders
and
pretenders
this
beer
stands
out
i
was
impressed
contender

caramel

chocolate
delicate

aroma
o
decent
an
easy

nonoffensive
and
generally
hits
the
right
notes
for
the
style
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
to
be
truthful
it
falls
way
short
of
my
expectations
an
oktoberfest
beer
for
my
taste
should
be
very
malty
and
spicytoffee
flavored
this
beer
was
just
bland
if
i
had
made
this
one
myself
i
definitely
would
not
be
very
proud
of
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
i
wouldnt
bring
it
to
a
friends
home
to
share
which
is
my
baseline
for
a
great
beer
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
been
disappointed
in
a
widmer
brothers
product
most
likely
will
not
buy
anything
from
this
house
again
if
you
are
a
wb
fan
i
dont
wish
to
offend
you
as
it
is
probably
just
my
palate
not
their
product
not
a
bad
beer
and
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
the
rich
toffee
flavors
distinct
for
the
style
and
the
citrusy
aspect
is
a
little
weird
its
pretty
to
look
at
though
overall
its
alright
no
complaints
but
seems
a
bit
lacking
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
copperorange
coloring
with
a
slow
flow
of
carbonation
in
the
body
and
a
filmy
light
fluffy
white
head
on
top
aromas
of
toasted
grain
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spices
and
subtle
caramel
sweetness
give
a
true
harvest
feel
to
the
aromas
rich
and
pleasant
nose
flavors
are
roasted
and
sweet
on
the
forward
tongue
with
a
sugary
undertone
that
detracts
from
the
overall
balance
of
the
beer
roasted
caramel
notes
hit
a
tangy
level
while
the
spices
present
on
the
nose
seem
to
all
but
disappear
on
the
palate
light
slighty
frothy
body
from
the
carbonation
but
even
that
cant
help
clear
the
cloying
sugary
linger
that
bleeds
all
the
way
through
to
the
slick
finish
this
one
started
great
for
me
but
then
seemed
to
spiral
out
of
control
from
there
o
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
beer
my
last
review
of
widmer
bros
was
an
unexpected
disappointment
but
they
have
redeemed
themselves
which
i
knew
they
would
this
beer
shows
how
versatile
they
can
be
as
most
of
what
i
have
tried
from
widmer
bros
has
been
hoppy
ales
this
has
a
nice
delicate
hop
in
the
background
that
accents
this
beer
nicely
the
flavor
is
malty
up
front
with
some
light
toasted
and
caramel
flavor
with
a
gentle
yeast
element
which
gives
way
to
some
light
herbal
and
slightly
spicey
hop
flavors
which
continue
into
the
finish
with
a
subtle
dry
quality
but
no
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
taste
i
like
a
good
alt
and
this
fits
with
a
bit
more
hops
than
the
german
counterpart
perhaps
but
the
flavor
is
clean
and
it
is
a
drinkable
example
of
the
style
o
just
ok
flavorwise
and
mediocre
in
other
categories
too
pretty
easy
to
drink
however
if
youre
craving
an
ale
of
the
style
and
on
the
light
side
the
taste
was
more
bitter
than
the
aroma
led
me
to
believe
it
would
be
some
mildly
sweet
malts
up
front
but
slight
lingering
note
at
the
end
overall
a
tasty
fall
brew
brewed
on
date
aug
12
2013
about
one
month
old
i
think
this
beer
might
suffer
from
not
quite
meeting
octoberfest
standards
and
not
quite
having
anything
distinctive
about
it
balanced
as
such
i
would
guess
most
raters
are
going
to
put
this
dead
in
the
middle
no
high
ratings
no
low
ratings
lots
of
average
ones
overall
a
rather
crisp
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
with
a
nice
blend
of
roasted
flavors
light
sweeter
flavors
and
spice
flavors
which
overall
create
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
decent
beer
that
could
use
greater
hop
inclusion
or
some
other
flavors
to
make
it
more
interesting
the
verdict
not
bad
a
solid
german
altbier
with
good
malt
backbone
and
enough
caramel
and
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
some
octoberfest
brews
are
overpowering
with
spice
to
me
but
this
one
is
just
about
right
o
i
dont
hate
this
beer
one
bit
but
i
certainly
do
not
love
it
it
is
just
soso
i
wouldnt
recommend
you
run
out
and
buy
it
when
its
being
made
but
i
might
want
to
try
a
fresh
one
of
these
one
day
to
see
if
the
added
ibu
brings
something
else
to
the
table
overall
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
not
outstanding
overall
not
a
bad
oktoberfest
although
it
definitely
tastes
more
like
an
altbier
pretty
unoffensive
but
mostly
forgettable

now
as

only

in
the

its
a
very

taste
reminds

of

both
of
which
are

ill
probably
share
the
rest
of
these
this

on

who
knows
it
may
introduce
some
friends
to
good
craft
beer
overall
a

i
was
surprised
at
how
good
this
is
and
could
easily
see
putting
back
a
few
on
a

o
an

not

familiar

this
one
drinks
more
like
an
octoberfest
to
me
o
overall
a
solid
altbier
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
alternative
than
al
the
bud
lights
being
drank
around
you

in

taste
worth
checking
out
in
a

with
not
a
lot
of

options
nice

but
thats
about
it
tastes
like
bread
and
has
a
sour
aftertaste
a
little
bit

sweet
flavor
would
have
helped
the
taste
is
the
number
one
priority
which
is
why
i
gave
it
a
overall
rating
to
match
the
taste
yazoo
never
fails
to
disappoint
overall
rather
disappointed
with
this
beer
dont
like
the
sweetness
and
i
dont
care
for
the
husky
grains
cheers
taste
is
again
toasty
and
grainy
with
a
tingehint
of
citrus
hops
at
finish
overall
a
sturdy
and
sessionworthy
ale
but
not
a
gamechanger
this
is
a
light
caramel
beer
kinda
like
a
washed
out
amber
bock
or
shiner
bock
this
beer
came
highly
recommended
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
think
it
is
a
great
easy
drinking
brew
i
havent
always
been
a
huge
fan
of
yazoo
but
i
think
this
beer
was
done
pretty
well
overall
bleh
not
really
an
amber
ale
taste
bready
and
cracker
tasting
herbal
earthy
hops
that
barely
bitter
it
and
just
add
meh
flavors
over
dried
finish
with
a
cracker
taste
and
not
really
enjoyable
this
continues
the
streak
of
bad
yazoo
beers
i
really
think
the
brewery
just
pumps
out
cheap
beer
or
maybe
they
only
bottle
the
lame
ones
dont
know
but
still
havent
found
a
good
one
a
very
nice
looking
pour
with
some
nice
complex
smells
however
it
falls
short
in
every
other
aspect
kind
of
a
disappointment
o
its
an
ok
beer
but
ive
come
to
expect
better
from
yazoo
not
offensive
but
not
memorable
a
bit
carbonated
but
very
easy
drinking
o
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
if
you
prefer
malty
flavors
with
virtually
no
hoppy
bitterness
that
i
could
detect
definitely
glad
i
got
a
growler
full
to
take
home
it
poured
an
dark
amber
almost
a
brown
with
a
good
one
inch
head
that
slowly
dissipated
malt
dominated
the
aroma
taste
was
clearly
a
malt
fest
of
flavors
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
but
not
cloying
dry
finish
with
low
bitterness
not
really
crisp
but
very
drinkable
balanced
and
pleasant
gerst
was
lightbodied
enough
to
go
well
with
food
pizza
and
was
very
sessionable
this
would
be
a
great
bridge
beer
for
relatives
not
sold
on
craft
beer
o
very
refreshing
great
as
a
session
beer
i
can
see
this
being
a
perfect
house
beer
for
the
gerst
haus
served
in
their
large
fishbowl
style
glasses
now
i
just
need
some
bratwurst
and
sauerkraut
this
is
amber
brown
with
orange
hues
in
the
body
a
good
head
sticks
on
top
of
the
beer
and
leaves
good
lace
the
nose
brings
vague
citrus
modest
bread
crust
and
some
toffee
however
the
aromas
intensity
is
a
little
softer
than
other
alts
not
so
much
with
the
taste
which
brings
a
note
of
citrus
from
the
hops
followed
by
the
standard
good
old
bread
crust
and
toffee
its
a
lightermedium
bodied
beer
which
is
both
refreshing
and
nicely
flavored
nothing
special
o
overall
this
is
one
of
the
worst
of
the
alts
that
we
had
during
our
stay
in
dusseldorf
given
the
high
ratings
that
others
have
given
this
beer
it
is
probably
not
the
best
sample
to
rate
i
will
still
give
it
another
try
some
spicy
grassy
german
hops
on
the
nose
some
mild
tasting
darkroasted
malt
residual
sweetness
and
a
medium
bitterness
on
finish
quite
a
sharp
profile
sessionable
but
i
preferred
some
of
the
other
alts
on
the
altstadt
seemed
to
be
on
tap
in
a
lot
of
restaurants
an
ok
altbier
no
more
no
less
than
that
anyway
some
hop
in
the
end
but
less
convincing
than
others
altbier
really
good
alt
here
though
perhaps
not
as
fresh
snappy
or
bitter
as
some
of
the
other
düsseldorf
alts
many
of
which
arent
really
distributed
in
de
frankenheim
alt
is
still
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
its
readily
available
in
german
supermarkets
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
spectacular
decently
carbonated
average
body
light
easy
to
drink
but
not
compelling
in
flavor
at
least
for
me
but
for
the
style
pretty
decent
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
interesting
first
try
of
the
style
shares
qualities
with
kellers
for
so
many
dark
flavors
stays
light
and
drinkable
high
drinkability
i
just
had
a
couple
of
these
in
bar
never
had
it
in
a
bottle
this
beer
has
body
i
liked
it
a
lot
without
really
knowing
why
nice
brown
with
white
foamy
head
very
full
flavored
and
malty
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
finish
and
other
pleasant
flavors
i
cant
pinpoint
made
this
a
delight
somewhat
syrupy
but
not
too
much
now
adays
i
cant
find
any
alt
except
for
a
few
micros
or
unless
i
want
to
spend
4
00bottle
for
some
fancy
import
from
germany
this
stuff
was
affordable
if
anyone
knows
where
to
get
some
in
iowa
or
adjacent
states
please
let
me
know
d
very
drinkable
tastes
pretty
good
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
but
i
enjoy
it
drinkability
flavourful
yet
crisp
and
refreshing
as
well
quite
wellbalanced
and
highly
drinkable
md
the
overall
flavour
is
more
fruity
with
an
assertive
soursweet
edge
than
both
hannen
and
niederrhein
alt
tasted
yesterday
but
the
sourness
seems
to
balance
with
the
lingering
bitterness
in
quite
a
harmony
a
wellhopped
and
bittered
brown
ale
but
still
suffering
a
little
from
the
thinish
body
overall
pretty
carbonated
but
not
such
that
it
disrupts
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
soft
and
watery
again
not
bad
but
also
not
too
impressive
not
quite
a
beast
of
a
beer
but
no
slouch
either
a
worthy
drink
but
not
something
id
run
to
germany
to
try
drinkability
is
great
the
concentration
and
profile
are
solid
coming
together
to
form
a
wonderful
alt
with
rich
flavors
and
a
medium
body
prost
d
an
ok
alt
but
not
enough
complexity
compared
to
other
and
the
watery
mouthfeel
lets
the
drinkability
down
this
beer
was
fair
but
nothing
especially
memorable
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
but
for
something
different
it
was
worth
a
try
taste
leans
heavy
on
the
munich
malts
a
medium
deep
earthy
maltiness
bitterness
is
not
as
high
as
other
german
counterparts
and
this
happens
to
be
the
nicest
thing
about
an
alt
for
me
a
pretty
ininspiring
alt
not
bad
but
lacks
in
character
this
was
an
old
bottle
yet
it
still
had
a
good
flavor
i
will
look
for
a
fresh
bottle
in
the
future
i
dont
think
the
pottery
in
williamsburg
rotates
its
stock
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
sure
would
like
to
have
tasted
a
fresher
bottle
as
this
is
nearing
the
end
of
its
life
nonetheless
the
essence
of
the
beer
comes
through
and
it
was
clearly
well
made
absolutely
beautiful
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
hefty
foam
top
that
lasted
through
the
first
few
sips
then
laced
the
glass
all
the
way
down
subtle
but
definite
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
carmel
sweetness
it
was
undoubtedly
an
older
batch
but
age
didnt
seem
to
have
affected
the
taste
other
than
a
hint
of
metallic
aftertaste
extremely
well
balanced
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
tartness
to
balance
the
malt
no
fruitiness
to
speak
of
with
a
nice
again
subtle
bitterness
to
keep
you
drinking
it
if
this
shelfaged
sample
is
this
good
i
cant
wait
to
take
that
trip
to
germany
to
try
it
fresh
from
the
brewery
in
the
meantime
ill
have
to
savor
the
few
bottles
i
could
find
left
in
the
us
and
hope
warsteiner
will
consider
bringing
it
back
of
course
it
may
well
have
been
only
poor
in
the
bar
i
was
in
so
please
try
it
if
you
see
it
and
let
me
know
if
it
was
a
one
off
on
my
part
my
favorite
beer
that
is
unfortunately
not
available
anymore
maybe
someday
warsteiner
the
company
that
now
owns
frankenheim
will
decide
to
import
to
the
us
again
poured
into
a
22
oz
stein
bright
white
head
that
gave
to
nice
lacing
hoppy
on
the
nose
brown
to
amber
in
color
well
balanced
rich
malty
undertones
that
finished
with
a
clean
hop
bitterness
easy
to
drink
this
one
i
will
miss
gotta
get
to
germany
opinion
i
am
really
happy
with
this
beer
and
this
is
one
that
i
would
get
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
was
available
here
in
texas
still
i
havent
seen
it
around
in
quite
some
time
to
keep
myself
fresh
with
this
style
i
make
homebrewed
versions
pretty
regularly
trying
mine
along
side
of
this
commercial
example
tells
me
that
i
still
have
quite
a
ways
to
go
to
get
this
style
right
my
version
is
quite
a
bit
darker
and
has
more
of
a
roasty
sharpness
where
as
the
frankenheim
gets
warmer
it
is
getting
much
fuller
ill
have
to
keep
tweaking
my
version
note
to
self
ranked
34
of
top
50
altbiers
when
i
tried
it
i
think
this
beer
would
be
great
with
meat
and
veggies
but
i
dont
really
like
it
by
itself
im
not
familiar
with
the
style
im
sure
its
a
good
altbier
maybe
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
i
will
try
it
again
some
time
i
love
the
german
ales
this
alt
is
very
authentic
and
tastey
for
a
high
volume
brewer
poured
a
lovely
deep
chestnut
color
with
red
highlights
nice
frothy
tan
cap
stacks
out
of
the
stein
and
lasted
great
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
sweet
malts
and
herbal
hops
slight
mustiness
starts
sharpdry
then
mellows
on
the
palate
as
the
sweet
malts
and
alt
yeast
produces
a
sweetnuttybready
taste
then
the
finish
becomes
drying
with
the
herbal
german
hops
providing
a
medicinal
bittering
in
the
finish
all
in
all
a
very
nice
commercial
alt
from
the
home
of
altbeir
dusseldorf
overall
fairly
decent
i
think
i
could
stand
to
try
this
a
little
fresher
than
i
found
it
pretty
good
deal
but
im
not
forgetting
the
uerige
brews
overall
impression
this
baby
aged
well
malt
goodness
with
a
clean
overall
taste
the
finish
is
a
bit
flat
in
taste
but
dries
enough
to
encourage
the
next
sip
quality
work
overall
it
was
served
in
frankenheim
specific
glass
at
waldo
pizza
brown
and
crystal
clear
with
no
head
i
felt
the
aroma
was
lacking
but
there
was
some
chococaramel
notes
very
good
chococaramel
flavor
though
med
body
for
2
bucks
a
glass
you
cant
beat
it
my
first
experience
with
an
altbier
poured
a
deep
copper
color
with
white
head
that
was
fell
to
a
lacy
retention
smell
is
roasty
with
a
caramel
background
the
taste
is
a
mixture
of
roasted
grains
a
toasted
maltiness
and
a
nice
hop
features
left
a
bitter
dry
taste
in
the
mouth
im
sorry
i
havent
tried
this
type
of
beer
before
but
i
wiil
need
to
some
other
examples
the
roasted
malt
flavour
is
pleasantly
rather
than
obnoxiously
smoky
there
are
hints
of
coffee
and
raspberry
hops
dont
seem
much
of
a
factor
i
like
the
carbonation
the
bubbles
feel
good
on
the
tongue
drinkability
not
really
my
style
of
beer
not
flavorful
enough
for
me
very
smooth
creamy
very
drinkable
decent
beer
nothing
amazing
fun
to
smell
though
thick
foamy
pale
brown
colored
head
leaves
large
patches
of
lace
transparent
hazel
colored
beer
with
a
copper
hue
floral
hop
aroma
with
a
bit
of
malt
underneath
lightly
sweet
malt
upfront
is
balanced
by
a
barely
bitter
hop
tea
flavor
that
kicks
in
midway
the
malt
fades
away
in
the
finish
leaving
a
tasty
mild
bitterness
the
body
is
light
but
not
thin
its
just
right
i
could
put
these
down
all
night
and
combined
with
the
fairly
low
abv
and
price
6
99
6pack
i
had
to
give
it
a
5
0
for
drinkability
now
i
just
need
to
find
a
local
source
its
a
great
session
beer
and
fabulous
with
grilled
foods
i
had
it
with
some
bbq
spare
ribs
nice
light
flavor
surprisngly
malt
and
fruit
and
zip
are
all
there
but
they
all
just
kind
of
die
near
the
middle
leaving
a
very
dry
aftertaste
strange
nice
color
kind
of
a
mahogany
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
looked
like
it
was
going
to
last
forever
but
dissipated
after
a
couple
of
minutes
nothing
special
about
the
smell
damn
my
nose
man
thin
bodied
with
a
mildly
hoppy
aftertaste
left
for
lack
of
a
better
term
a
carbonation
buzz
on
my
tongue
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
do
it
again
a
decent
german
brew
ive
had
a
few
altbiers
prior
to
this
one
and
i
remember
them
much
more
fondly
than
frankenheim
alt
the
unfortunate
thing
is
that
it
seems
as
if
theres
a
good
beer
in
there
struggling
to
get
out
more
malt
would
seem
to
be
the
ideal
solution
thumbs
down
a
lighttomedium
body
very
smooth
but
the
alcohol
while
low
in
abv
was
a
little
too
noticeable
otherwise
a
very
drinkable
brew
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
an
oktoberfest
with
the
caramel
maltiness
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
a
nice
drinkable
ale
that
i
would
enjoy
doing
it
again
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
with
about
one
and
a
half
fingers
of
creamy
creamcolored
head
a
creamy
film
lingers
a
long
time
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
roasted
malt
with
a
little
hops
taste
is
initially
malty
toasty
maybe
a
bit
smoky
with
some
carmel
notes
an
almost
chocolate
flavor
in
the
middle
finishes
with
some
herbal
hop
bitterness
clean
dry
finish
medium
body
with
good
mouthfeel
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
pretty
tasty
and
a
little
different
i
liked
it
it
was
an
all
right
beer
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
more
it
was
however
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
just
a
mislabled
one
i
think
it
should
have
labled
a
brown
ale
deep
brown
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
into
an
uneven
layer
of
foam
across
the
top
of
the
beer
smells
of
carmel
toffee
roasted
malts
coffee
bananas
and
hops
taste
is
distinct
to
say
the
least
dark
roasted
malts
are
mainly
present
more
banana
in
the
flavor
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
bitterness
to
finish
for
my
first
true
alt
this
is
a
very
good
one
i
would
recommend
the
beer
and
the
style
almost
like
a
macro
only
way
to
describe
it
is
beerlike
nothing
distinguishes
this
from
any
other
run
of
the
mill
brown
thick
offwhite
twofinger
head
sits
atop
a
clear
brown
beer
plenty
of
head
retention
little
bubbles
lazily
float
upwards
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
thick
with
caramel
malts
maybe
some
figs
and
plums
in
there
as
well
taste
starts
with
a
nice
earthy
hop
bitterness
quickly
followed
by
smooth
caramel
malt
flavors
maybe
some
roasted
malt
characteristics
in
there
towards
the
finish
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
very
prickly
with
carbonation
and
a
drying
sensation
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
there
is
an
overall
smoothness
that
fills
the
mouth
very
drinkable
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
with
a
toasty
breadlike
aroma
that
is
a
bit
bitter
and
dry
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
smooth
malty
core
with
a
dry
and
slightly
bitter
finish
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
creamy
ending
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
it
has
fantastic
flavor
and
aroma
an
excellent
sessions
brew
this
is
a
smooth
and
rounded
beverage
it
goes
well
with
sausages
and
breaded
veal
dishes
except
for
the
disappointing
taste
this
beer
is
generally
drinkable
but
that
taste
makes
me
want
to
go
elsewhere
the
pour
is
a
beautiful
deep
copper
and
the
head
forms
up
big
bold
and
creamy
with
a
fantastic
lace
and
amazing
retention
aromas
and
flavors
while
malt
oriented
are
balanced
nicely
with
bitter
clean
and
very
crisp
in
the
mouth
this
medium
bodied
alt
is
all
that
and
a
bag
of
chips
loads
of
toasty
malt
a
biscuity
malt
at
that
a
bit
of
steelmineral
and
a
long
luxurious
and
faintly
hoppy
finish
make
this
a
damn
well
balanced
and
awesome
session
brew
that
i
will
visit
again
real
soon
when
poured
in
my
mug
out
of
the
tap
it
was
a
medium
dark
brown
with
a
little
bit
of
tan
foam
the
smell
had
a
little
aroma
of
roasted
malts
but
not
much
more
of
anything
else
the
flavor
was
of
a
brown
ale
that
was
just
a
hint
above
average
not
overly
impressed
with
this
tap
beer
but
would
possibly
try
it
again
worth
a
try
if
you
never
had
it
after
reading
other
reviews
not
sure
if
this
bottle
was
bad
or
i
missed
the
boat
pleasantly
suprised
this
is
an
interesting
unique
and
very
easy
to
drink
alt
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
who
has
hated
every
alt
hes
tried
so
far
the
great
drinkability
unique
woodsy
characteristics
and
soft
mouthfeel
contribute
to
a
drink
that
i
would
gladly
purchase
again
perfectly
balanced
lovely
creation
never
had
an
alt
that
i
thougt
was
worth
even
snorting
at
but
this
is
amazing
nice
brew
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
i
am
not
all
that
familiar
with
alt
beers
but
i
think
this
was
a
nice
beer
for
newcomers
to
the
style
the
color
was
a
nice
dark
caramel
and
the
white
head
was
a
good
1
finger
thick
there
was
a
fairly
heavy
malty
smell
the
overall
taste
was
very
comparable
to
a
normal
brown
ale
but
it
had
a
little
more
kick
to
the
finish
i
have
had
one
of
these
a
few
months
ago
and
was
not
impressed
but
this
time
it
seemed
better
nothing
great
but
not
too
bad
either
pours
a
dark
coppery
colour
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
stays
around
for
a
bit
and
continues
to
lace
nicely
smell
is
a
bit
of
buttery
grains
with
a
bit
of
breadiness
taste
the
malt
is
a
bit
subdued
and
the
beer
is
dryer
than
one
would
think
very
nicely
balanced
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
might
indicate
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
an
nice
carbonation
level
this
beer
goes
down
easily
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
the
only
real
german
alt
available
in
my
area
i
would
love
to
try
more
of
them
if
this
is
indicative
of
the
style
this
beer
pours
out
a
cola
colored
brown
body
smooth
creamy
colored
head
doesnt
last
for
too
long
the
nose
is
caramel
malts
the
malt
taste
is
kinda
subdued
this
beer
has
sort
of
a
metallic
taste
to
it
hops
are
there
but
you
have
to
look
for
them
this
is
my
first
venture
in
the
alt
style
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
a
very
fine
looking
ale
its
a
deep
clear
chestnut
brown
with
a
frothy
biege
head
which
begins
to
lapse
into
a
a
thickish
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
pastry
in
the
beginning
but
soon
picks
up
grassy
characteristics
and
a
hop
presence
flavour
packs
toasted
dry
malt
along
with
astringent
herbal
tones
and
a
bittering
hop
finish
that
is
very
dry
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
but
the
aftertaste
leaves
the
palate
dry
nearly
parched
a
very
curious
experience
yet
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
although
looks
are
deceiving
in
this
case
it
is
still
a
very
attractive
looking
beer
all
things
said
and
done
what
lurks
beneath
was
totally
unexpected
malts
malts
and
more
dry
malts
the
color
is
dark
and
full
of
brownish
hues
and
offers
a
light
and
short
lasting
off
white
head
not
the
most
attractive
appearance
but
nothing
to
put
ur
nose
up
at
smell
is
bready
and
presents
notes
of
ginger
and
hickory
flavor
is
much
the
same
and
has
no
discernable
hop
properties
mouthfeel
is
full
and
leaves
a
satisfied
feeling
in
the
belly
i
didnt
feel
that
this
brew
was
particularly
drinkable
though
kinda
boring
and
it
left
an
unwelcomed
sour
aftertaste
appearance
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
sized
cream
colored
head
sitting
atop
the
body
leaving
nice
uneven
rings
of
lacing
not
bad
at
all
aroma
darker
roasts
toasted
nicely
with
an
underlying
sweetness
in
the
background
not
bad
at
all
taste
soft
tones
of
malt
sweetness
balanced
with
a
dose
of
german
hops
and
harsher
roasted
malts
coming
to
the
forefront
of
the
flavor
simple
and
straight
forward
mass
produced
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
with
a
medium
to
light
body
a
nice
intro
to
the
alt
style
bier
drinkability
very
good
crisp
refreshing
and
flavorful
not
over
the
top
but
a
balanced
beer
that
you
can
seperate
where
all
the
tones
are
coming
from
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
either
dark
copper
body
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
a
blend
of
bread
roasted
malt
hops
and
wood
very
smooth
taste
tons
of
malt
reminds
me
of
a
bock
to
be
sure
flavors
get
a
little
more
roasty
as
the
beer
warms
nice
carbonation
little
or
no
bitterness
and
a
semi
sweet
finish
that
is
most
appealing
a
nice
example
of
a
finely
crafted
dusseldorf
style
alt
beer
excellent
beer
had
a
nice
clear
dark
copper
color
and
poured
with
a
health
one
inch
head
although
the
head
died
down
moderately
fast
a
decent
lace
was
formed
that
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
slight
bit
of
hops
flavor
was
most
noticeably
about
the
malts
which
were
a
little
roasty
and
picked
up
a
little
sweet
fruitiness
as
the
beer
warmed
the
beer
was
fairly
light
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
a
touch
creamy
towards
the
middle
there
was
only
a
slight
hop
finish
and
malts
came
though
again
in
the
aftertaste
not
a
very
assertive
brew
but
okay
non
the
less
clear
copperyreddishbrown
hue
offwhite
foamy
bubbly
head
a
fingers
worth
at
its
apex
slowly
fades
good
retention
very
minimal
lace
i
was
surprised
at
how
clean
and
hollow
the
nose
was
light
caramel
and
grainhuskhaygrass
hints
mediocre
the
palate
is
crisp
and
refreshing
light
toastiness
caramel
malts
very
mild
bitterness
lightly
husky
grassy
decent
medium
body
modest
carbonation
good
durable
mouthfeel
clean
finish
very
balanced
maybe
too
much
so
nothing
grabs
your
tastebuds
and
says
hello
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
enough
nothing
worth
hunting
down
but
id
quaff
it
again
if
need
be
this
alt
would
be
a
good
beer
to
cross
people
over
with
more
lagerlike
that
alelike
dark
amber
and
almost
brown
looking
with
no
head
at
all
earthy
aroma
to
it
with
a
slight
malt
fragrance
very
thin
and
reminded
me
of
a
pils
only
darker
beer
was
served
so
cold
i
really
couldnt
seek
out
its
flavors
all
that
well
but
nothing
really
stuck
out
as
to
flavor
with
the
exception
of
some
malt
presence
f
this
is
the
first
alt
ive
ever
had
at
the
local
beverage
store
i
was
debating
between
chosing
a
hearty
ale
or
a
crisp
pilsner
decided
to
give
this
alt
a
try
instead
as
it
is
a
nice
compromise
among
the
two
the
head
on
the
beer
was
impressive
at
the
start
but
receded
to
fairly
thin
line
unlike
the
british
style
ales
where
it
generally
persists
longer
the
beer
leans
more
towards
malty
to
dry
rather
than
an
overly
hoppy
taste
very
refreshing
and
smooth
like
a
lager
but
not
as
bland
this
is
very
drinkable
brew
that
is
somewhat
let
down
by
a
lack
of
body
will
try
again
from
time
to
time
the
beer
came
to
me
with
a
nice
dark
copper
body
and
large
offwhite
head
that
lasted
well
and
produced
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
pleasant
though
light
and
gave
off
some
malty
and
nutty
sense
the
taste
itself
was
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
with
just
enough
bite
to
give
a
decent
finish
this
is
a
nice
beer
on
tap
and
one
that
ill
revisit
not
bad
dry
and
just
a
bit
thin
in
body
and
flavor
i
could
drink
another
though
low
abv
so
if
you
are
looking
to
get
happy
look
elsewhere
the
bottle
i
had
was
a
little
oxidized
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
unenjoyable
aroma
of
biscuity
grain
caramel
chocolate
and
a
nice
sweetness
brown
beer
with
some
red
highlights
and
a
light
tan
head
caramel
and
a
nice
sweetness
dominant
with
a
solid
grain
flavor
underneath
light
bodied
pours
with
a
superbly
massive
longlived
just
offwhite
head
like
someone
placed
a
dollop
of
freshwhipped
cream
on
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
clean
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
the
taste
is
semiroasty
and
dry
with
a
slight
nod
to
coffeeish
notes
light
and
spritzy
on
der
palate
finshes
dry
and
extremely
clean
an
excellent
session
beer
a
great
alt
beer
smooth
and
excellent
balance
of
malt
and
hops
this
ruby
dark
brown
ale
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
highly
drinkable
spicy
with
the
nice
alt
body
that
lends
itself
to
this
style
low
abv
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
ale
and
the
smooth
texture
of
the
beer
adds
to
a
good
session
ale
drinkability
outstanding
this
brew
is
damn
good
its
rich
and
flavorful
yet
clean
and
smooth
enough
to
keep
it
highly
drinkable
very
soft
in
the
mouth
with
subtle
toffee
and
the
bready
malt
has
a
bit
of
a
zing
to
it
that
i
didnt
expect
which
makes
it
quite
refreshing
more
malt
and
hop
spice
come
out
with
time
wellbalanced
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
one
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
amberchestnutmahogany
brown
in
color
it
was
clear
and
well
carbonated
it
produced
a
head
that
was
tan
in
color
and
the
consistency
was
dense
foamy
and
seemingly
sticky
the
lace
that
it
produced
had
much
of
the
same
characteristics
as
the
head
sticky
and
stretchy
the
aromas
that
were
pouring
out
of
the
glass
were
of
roasted
malt
nuts
floral
hops
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
fruit
and
yeast
as
well
the
tastes
were
of
a
good
percentage
of
hops
mostly
floral
but
i
also
noticed
some
burnt
malt
roasted
nuts
and
malts
yeast
and
fruit
it
was
slightly
watery
in
the
beginningmiddle
but
over
all
it
was
dry
the
aftertastes
were
mostly
of
floral
hops
this
beer
was
clean
and
crisp
imo
it
quenched
my
thirst
with
its
dry
nature
states
that
it
follows
the
strictest
german
purity
law
reinheitsgebot
and
i
would
have
to
agree
not
stellar
but
really
good
especially
if
you
want
to
experience
reinheitsgebot
there
is
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouth
feel
overall
the
frankenheim
is
a
well
balanced
brew
with
great
drinkability
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
rich
malty
with
a
bit
of
grain
and
toastiness
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
in
the
flavor
it
is
somewhat
light
in
body
smooth
and
easy
drinking
not
a
bad
alt
i
would
sample
this
one
again
fairly
uncomplicated
beer
aroma
was
malt
with
a
slight
roast
and
caramel
notes
and
a
hint
of
hops
medium
sized
but
steady
and
somewhat
thick
head
with
good
stamina
amber
color
with
more
brown
than
orange
or
red
hues
taste
is
restrained
a
blending
of
a
smooth
malt
with
some
bitterness
but
lacking
in
a
bite
or
bitterness
surprisingly
thin
with
lower
carbonation
but
a
clean
presence
and
softer
feel
this
is
a
fine
and
drinkable
beer
but
lacks
strength
of
character
the
smell
is
sweetish
some
toffeelike
malt
a
touch
sour
nice
the
front
is
toffee
and
dust
the
middle
is
a
little
watery
leading
to
a
dry
finish
to
me
this
is
pretty
much
indistinguishable
from
a
good
amber
na
a
good
solid
malt
base
with
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
to
it
a
little
bit
of
fruits
come
through
just
before
the
dry
and
somewhat
roasty
aftertaste
it
is
very
smooth
with
extremely
light
carbonation
i
cant
say
anything
fantastic
about
it
but
it
is
certainly
a
good
beer
copper
brown
amber
with
a
nice
head
nice
malts
a
touch
sweet
smooth
light
fruity
and
toasty
hops
are
well
balanced
quite
complex
and
quite
good
one
of
the
better
alts
available
nice
dry
finish
certainly
worth
a
sample
if
you
can
find
it
with
its
top
fermentation
i
would
love
to
have
this
with
bbq
pork
a
lovely
clear
reddishmahogany
body
reveals
some
goldenorange
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
a
short
but
creamy
white
head
holds
fairly
well
and
initially
leaves
thin
sheets
of
lace
about
the
glass
it
drops
to
a
creamy
collar
but
continues
to
leave
some
nice
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
grainy
toasted
malts
with
a
light
touch
of
diacetyl
that
adds
to
its
complexity
with
its
buttery
character
adding
warmth
and
combining
with
the
toasted
malt
to
give
it
a
gentle
nuttiness
the
body
is
light
but
creamy
and
smooth
due
to
an
impressively
fine
and
moderate
carbonation
in
the
case
of
this
particular
beer
it
adds
to
the
overall
drinkability
the
flavor
is
as
might
be
expected
given
the
aroma
with
a
toasty
malt
upfront
grassy
and
herbal
hop
flavors
as
it
crosses
the
palate
and
some
residual
butteriness
and
caramel
character
in
the
gently
lingering
dry
finish
the
bitterness
is
firm
against
the
relatively
light
maltiness
and
its
exceptionally
wellbalanced
its
a
bit
lighter
in
overall
character
than
some
other
dusseldorfer
alts
but
its
still
quite
drinkable
with
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
throughout
several
servings
well
worth
trying
theres
not
much
that
i
can
say
about
this
beer
except
that
i
hated
it
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12inch
head
that
faded
away
quickly
leaving
no
lace
the
aroma
was
very
skunky
with
some
mild
malt
undertones
the
taste
was
just
as
skunky
as
the
aroma
i
noticed
a
slight
bit
of
nuttiness
and
malt
there
was
a
wretched
bitter
aftertaste
left
it
took
all
i
had
to
finish
this
one
off
solid
brown
with
no
head
slight
aroma
of
sweet
maltyness
taste
is
clean
and
crispy
sweet
taste
of
sweet
malt
and
grains
yeast
like
notes
but
very
light
light
body
feel
a
small
malty
sweet
tang
with
a
slight
hop
presence
everything
about
this
beer
speaks
drinkable
very
clean
and
malty
sweet
not
bad
at
all
pat
this
alt
pours
very
clear
brown
with
a
fair
white
head
the
head
retention
is
fairly
good
and
keeps
some
lace
on
the
glass
the
munich
malts
were
all
that
i
could
smell
there
were
no
hops
an
alt
should
have
a
bitterness
and
an
malty
offset
i
tasted
the
bitterness
a
little
and
the
malt
even
less
this
beer
finishes
with
a
little
sweetness
i
think
it
finishes
better
than
it
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
semi
full
and
has
little
carbonation
or
tingle
on
the
tongue
it
is
an
okay
beer
alts
are
not
big
in
my
book
and
this
one
falls
to
the
middle
of
that
pack
light
brown
in
color
doesnt
look
all
that
appealing
for
a
brown
ale
next
to
some
of
its
english
counterparts
but
that
is
the
only
area
this
beer
falls
short
in
this
brew
starts
out
dry
and
crisp
with
some
mild
hop
bitterness
then
quickly
switches
gear
into
a
smooth
malt
flavor
it
is
clean
all
the
way
through
with
no
detectable
esters
or
diactyl
this
alt
is
highly
drinkable
any
time
of
year
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
reminiscent
of
texas
style
iced
tea
the
head
is
fair
and
settles
out
quickly
the
nose
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
middle
level
hop
scent
the
flavor
is
a
crisp
malt
with
a
medium
strength
hop
all
across
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
silk
also
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
i
enjoy
it
poured
a
nice
brown
color
with
medium
headnot
alot
of
smell
mainly
malty
taste
was
very
dry
and
spicyspiciest
alt
style
i
have
had
very
pepperyi
think
goes
well
with
alot
of
food
medium
bodied
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
classic
for
a
reason
very
well
made
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
alt
ive
ever
had
im
going
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
just
to
see
how
it
will
compare
to
this
bottle
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
just
had
this
for
the
first
time
at
lunch
today
quite
a
solid
altbier
great
dark
brown
color
obscure
chocolate
and
malty
nose
silky
smooth
easy
to
drink
no
noticeable
bitterness
but
a
solid
somewhat
dry
somewhat
roasty
sweet
malty
presence
more
so
than
most
ales
of
course
its
not
a
terribly
complex
beer
and
is
hard
to
say
anything
creative
about
it
as
a
result
but
its
straightforward
taste
is
appreciated
and
representative
of
the
style
wonderful
example
of
the
style
malty
with
a
slight
aftertaste
of
hops
beautiful
rich
brown
color
with
a
head
that
poured
to
two
fingers
and
stuck
around
just
long
enough
left
little
lace
though
although
this
may
be
my
glasss
fault
rather
than
the
biers
this
is
a
bier
that
i
could
drink
for
hours
i
bought
this
as
a
single
not
knowing
anything
about
this
particular
brew
and
i
will
certainly
return
for
more
mouthfeel
i
expected
a
little
more
body
to
this
beer
it
was
on
the
thin
side
however
it
was
not
difficult
to
finish
id
like
to
try
this
ontap
and
see
how
it
tastes
clear
brown
nice
lasting
tan
head
sweet
bready
aroma
slightly
metallic
the
beer
is
clean
dry
grainy
and
nutty
a
certain
offness
cardboard
kept
this
beer
from
being
exceptional
it
was
still
quite
tasty
and
i
could
imagine
myself
drinking
dozens
of
little
glasses
of
this
in
dusseldorf
deep
amber
colored
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
and
abundant
carbonation
lots
of
thick
and
sticky
irregular
lace
rich
aroma
of
dark
bread
with
slight
earth
and
smoke
notes
taste
begins
with
rich
toasted
malt
flavors
that
segue
into
restrained
hops
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
carbonation
is
quite
delicate
almost
unnoticed
aftertaste
is
largely
absent
merely
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
a
truly
superior
alt
as
good
as
it
gets
pours
a
dark
copper
colour
and
in
combination
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
perfect
malty
aroma
tastes
sweeter
than
what
i
expected
hints
of
chocolate
good
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
quite
easily
very
dark
in
appearance
almost
black
with
an
overflowing
whitish
head
very
sweet
tasting
from
the
malt
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
not
much
in
the
hop
flavor
department
this
alt
is
all
about
the
malt
very
drinkable
because
the
low
level
of
bittering
hops
did
not
dry
out
the
tounge
nor
did
the
malt
factor
become
too
cloying
it
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
but
still
a
nice
tradtional
german
treat
as
it
is
i
had
this
beer
recently
on
tap
at
ludwigs
in
philadelphia
it
was
my
first
taste
of
a
true
german
altstyle
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
great
very
unique
deep
copper
color
with
a
creamy
head
ultradry
yet
smooth
with
virtually
no
aftertaste
very
drinkable
i
did
get
some
spicy
peppery
hop
notes
which
gave
the
beer
some
of
its
character
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
if
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
then
i
might
have
a
new
favorite
this
is
one
i
could
of
drank
all
night
and
definitely
one
to
seek
out
316
you
can
be
assured
that
this
was
not
a
biased
review
only
after
tasting
and
rating
it
i
noticed
the
eagle
on
the
label
quality
lace
over
deep
tea
lagerlike
sulfurous
nose
highlights
the
malt
aroma
nice
balance
a
lingering
bitterness
keeps
the
malt
backbone
in
order
an
easy
drinking
german
ale
and
for
5
50
a
six
i
will
no
doubt
be
trying
it
again
the
aroma
is
decoctionmalty
with
hints
of
graininess
the
brew
starts
out
very
grainydry
with
a
rather
tingly
mouthfeel
it
sweetens
as
the
sip
goes
along
with
chocolate
caramel
and
fig
flavor
notes
joining
the
graininess
the
bitterness
is
there
throughout
also
growing
towards
the
finish
the
finish
is
a
mix
of
bitter
sweet
and
grain
that
is
very
enjoyable
not
too
shabby
i
kindof
like
this
one
and
it
is
a
sure
change
up
in
my
fridge
if
you
are
not
sure
what
an
alt
is
supposed
to
taste
like
this
is
a
good
starting
point
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
dusseldorfalt
bier
as
per
style
guidlines
the
finish
also
had
a
slight
smokey
taste
interesting
beer
and
one
that
does
stimulate
the
palate
chestnut
amber
color
nicely
frothy
1
inch
head
sweet
coconut
and
nutty
smells
very
nice
the
taste
is
another
matter
to
me
i
too
had
a
bottle
not
destined
to
expire
for
many
months
and
still
got
a
heavy
mix
of
slight
skunk
and
wet
cardboard
from
the
malts
there
is
a
residual
nuttiness
though
hops
on
the
other
hand
are
nice
and
give
a
good
crispness
unfortunately
the
malt
tastes
that
are
in
good
balance
with
the
hops
are
not
particularly
pleasant
some
german
brews
have
a
similar
malt
character
that
i
usually
call
nutty
rather
than
cardboard
but
residual
sweetness
is
low
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
a
little
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
behind
smells
of
malts
some
hops
but
mostly
an
ether
type
smell
taste
has
a
good
balance
at
the
presentation
till
the
end
where
it
starts
tasting
like
it
smells
feel
is
overall
pretty
smooth
its
a
pretty
average
beer
with
a
different
taste
if
you
like
brown
ales
and
wanted
to
try
it
go
for
it
i
dunno
i
remember
hearing
about
double
bag
way
back
in
2005
or
soback
in
the
day
it
was
possible
for
malt
bombs
to
generate
buzz
believe
it
or
not
maybe
my
pallet
has
just
been
destroyed
by
the
extremeness
of
the
modern
beer
scene
or
maybe
this
was
just
an
off
batch
either
way
i
was
let
down
got
some
kick
too
5
words
flavorful
and
warming
a
very
good
brew
im
not
that
familiar
with
the
style
but
damn
this
is
a
tasty
beer
great
malt
backbone
without
being
too
sweet
and
a
nice
mild
hop
character
very
drinkable
at
7
2
i
had
had
it
years
before
and
didnt
care
for
it
this
one
was
given
to
me
from
the
rep
the
other
may
have
been
old
the
malt
character
jumped
right
out
and
there
was
no
hint
of
the
strength
very
tasty
malt
sweetness
without
being
too
much
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
this
style
for
comparison
one
of
my
gotos
long
trail
is
consistently
good
i
like
that
it
is
7
2
so
you
can
catch
a
decent
buzz
of
of
1
or
2
however
you
cant
taste
it
relatively
bitter
but
something
that
could
get
you
through
your
family
picnick
in
a
pinch
i
reccomend
it
to
all
of
my
beer
loving
friends
nice
taste
light
for
the
alcohol
content
finish
is
good
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
malty
well
crafted
but
not
my
favorite
style
a
double
alt
this
is
like
making
an
imperial
berliner
weisse
it
should
never
be
done
however
its
quite
tasty
when
its
cool

if
youre
looking
to
stick
every
rating
here
on
at
least
one
beer
this
fits
the
justabovethemiddleoftheroad
rating
its
got
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
takes
away
from
the
initial
taste
but
not
so
bitter
that
it
runs
it
its
just

penetrating

is

not
a

prevalent
beer
style
so
dont
really
know
how
it
stacks
up
very
good
but
a
little
malty
for
my
taste
and
it
strangely
seems
to
lack
carbonation
this
beer
was
one
of
the
first
big
beers
i
ever
had
and
i
continue
to
enjoy
it
to
this
day
you
all
sound
like
a
bunch
of
pinkys
up
hoity
toities
i
love
this
beer
and
think
it
kinda
feels
like
milk
in
my
mouth
i
really
enjoy
this
beerits
got
so
many
things
going
for
it
including
the
really
nice
taste
that
they
far
outweigh
the
average
mouthfeel
very
good
beer
i
had
one
good
one
once
it
was
a
16
oz
can
and
was
really
tasty
but
ive
had
it
again
more
times
than
i
could
reasonably
remember
and
all
have
been
awful
skunky
and
funky
and
no
bueno
many
bottles
many
pints
all
terrible
except
for
one
its
almost
mythical
and
actually
i
keep
trying
this
beer
like
a
sucker
hoping
for
another
good
one
o
the
malt
notes
are
great
they
are
mellow
but
the
depth
is
nice
even
after
being
settled
out
in
lagering
hop
bitterness
is
great
and
cuts
the
sweetness
some
but
doesnt
take
over
the
beer
a
slight
bit
of
booze
at
7
2
too
much
sweetness
an
interesting
mineral
back
note
not
much
hop
id
pick
this
over
other
longtrails
but
only
in
a
pinch
pours
a
dark
yellow
almost
brown
with
a
thick
head
that
lasts
for
a
bit
the
smell
is
very
sweet
both
from
the
alcohol
as
well
as
the
malt
the
taste
was
really
nice
balancing
the
sweet
malt
with
the
bitter
hops
to
cancel
out
a
bit
of
the
intense
alcohol
flavor
i
found
it
very
nice
and
a
good
sipping
beer
that
is
easy
to
pair
with
large
meals
would
highly
recommend
not
my
kind
of
thing
overall
a
good
try
from
long
trail
at
a
true
doppelsticke
alt
but
i
still
felt
bad
for
it
in
the
glass
next
to
freigeist
it
is
very
hard
to
duplicate
such
a
delicate
german
style
that
is
so
refined
which
is
why
so
few
american
breweries
dabble
in
them

the

who

malty
brews
this

a

strong
altbeer
perfect
for

the

compensates
somewhat

drinkable
any

probably
one
of
the

in

overall
very
good
beer
i
cant
go
more
than
a
week
or
two
with
a
six
pack
of
this
one
i
will
always
go
back
full
flavor
very
drinkable
for
a
fairly
high
abv
beer
smooth
flavorful
full
bodied
and
balanced
everything
i
look
for
in
an
ale
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
ale
im
drinking
this
bad
boy
out
of
a
bottle
in
a
beer
glass
the
beer
is
copper
colored
and
i
have
found
that
you
really
have
to
play
with
it
as
you
pour
in
order
to
get
a
noticeable
head
which
is
cream
colored
and
retains
for
about
5
secs
the
beer
has
a
faint
noticeable
smell
that
is
malty
maybe
with
a
little
fruit
when
you
taste
it
there
is
an
initial
very
malty
toffee
flavor
followed
by
a
smooth
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
which
sometimes
persists
this
is
a
beer
that
stays
with
you
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
producing
continuing
flavors
after
the
initial
taste
it
is
very
sweet
and
goes
well
after
dinner
it
is
tough
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
as
they
are
very
rich
and
flavorful
o
this
isnt
my
double
bag
as
the
scores
reflect
still
i
dont
hate
it
decent
to
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
a
full
6
pack
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
good
change
from
all
the
ipas
ive
been
having
lately
very
very
different
as
no
one
part
of
this
beer
stands
out
but
it
all
comes
together
well
definitely
something
to
have
again
in
the
future
a
big
malty
beer
with
enough
balance
and
complexity
to
keep
you
interested
sip
after
sip
heavy
on
the
residual
sugars
it
tastes
and
feels
much
like
a
barley
wine
deep
and
inviting
for
a
big
beer
would
have
again
worth
getting
ahold
of
o
i
had
an
altbier
of
regular
strength
last
week
that
was
more
flavorful
drinks
smooth
on
the
palate
its
fairly
clean
with
pretty
much
no
aftertaste
o
as
mentioned
before
its
not
overly
complicated
but
all
the
flavors
in
here
work
really
well
drinks
really
smooth
and
is
quite
enjoyable
sometimes
sold
out
not
real
heavy
if
you
dont
want
a
stout
but
something
a
little
lighter
o
solid
brew
wellbuilt
and
well
balanced
overall
interesting
but
not
in
the
most
appetizing
way
could
see
it
growing
on
me
however
the
juxtaposition
of
the
flavors
while
not
outright
complementary
definitely
gives
one
something
to
mull
over
overall
a
very
nice
clean
crisp
beer
definitely
maltheavy
without
being
out
of
balance
crisp
finish
with
lingering
bitterness
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
in
no
way
would
i
guess
this
was
over
7
abv
its
a
bit
big
for
the
style
altbier
but
its
a
great
beer
o
im
surprisingly
okay
with
this
beer
i
was
wary
of
the
maltforwardness
coming
into
my
first
taste
but
it
really
was
pleasant
to
drink
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
the
summer
but
thankfully
it
was
cool
out
tonight
not
bad
at
all
overall
this
is
so
readily
available
around
here
i
keep
on
forgetting
how
good
a
quality
this
beer
is
this
is
a
nice
and
sweet
malty
treat
it
is
sweet
without
ever
being
cloying
i
do
like
this
one
on
the
colder
side
though
overall
impressed
by
this
one
my
favorite

nice

nice
mouthfeel
not
too
thin

thick

ale
slightly
sharp
on
the

drinks
quite
nice
really
nice
brew
thats
readily

i
love
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
and
one
that
i
always
keep
in
my
fridge
it
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
malt
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
delicious
very
drinkable
in
spite
of
the
relatively
high
abv
i
had
long
ignored
long
trails
beers
and
now
im
regretting
not
trying
double
bag
sooner
this
is
surely
one
beer
that
will
wind
up
in
my
fridge
time
and
again
o
actually
a
pretty
good
offering
from
long
trail
im
not
really
familiar
with
this
style
but
its
not
what
i
expected
but
it
does
have
a
nice
complexity
in
taste
that
is
good
and
refreshing
would
really
like
to
get
this
on
tap
long
trails
altbier
is
a
great
beer
not
quite
a
traditional
version
but
still
quite
tasty
nonetheless
it
is
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
pours
a
caramelamber
color
with
an
almost
nonexistent
head
which
disappears
instantly
to
leave
a
thin
topping
smells
caramel
some
cereals
little
earthy
notes
slightly
herbal
at
the
back
flavors
are
very
mild
and
clean
similar
to
the
nose
and
in
my
opinion
not
so
enjoyable
moderate
carbonation
with
low
bitterness
i
didnt
like
this
one
wonder
if
its
a
bad
bottle
or
i
just
dont
like
the
style
sweet
and
biscuity
incredibly
easy
drinking
and
smooth
for
7
2
always
a
fan
of
the
double
bag
o
hands
downby
farlong
trails
best
yearround
probably
all
together
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
at
just
a
dollar
more
than
any
other
lt
6pack
it
is
a
steal
here
in
long
trails
home
state
one
of
my
choice
goto
vt
sixers
under
10
o
long
trails
double
bag
shows
no
signs
of
being
a
strong
ale
with
its
nice
malty
presence
and
deceptively
smooth
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
that
straddles
the
line
of
ale
and
lager
with
characteristics
of
both
coming
through
o
everything
works
well
together
and
this
is
remarkably
easy
to
drink
in
spite
of
the
abv
i
want
another
and
its
a
tough
act
for
the
single
bag
to
follow
nice
malty
flavor
with
some
bite
and
not
too
mention
the
7
2
abv
kick
my
vote
is
to
give
it
a
shot
and
then
move
on
o
an
old
stand
by
one
of
my
goto
brews
when
im
not
sure
what
i
want
nice
ale
with
a
high
alcohol
content
very
drinkable
plus
for
vermont
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
its
a
bit
sweet
and
bitter
for
me
for
the
style
not
exactly
a
session
ale
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
i
might
pick
some
more
up
sometime
great
beer
overall
i
will
def
be
enjoying
again
soon
overall
it
was
a
decent
brew
it
had
some
good
malty
flavors
and
a
light
herbal
hop
worth
a
try
but
nothing
that
is
super
exceptional
a
decent
stronger
alt
style
ale
dark
amber
in
color
with
onefinger
head
which
disappears
fairly
quickly
clear
and
very
smooth
malty
with
minimal
hops
i
havent
figured
out
yet
how
to
describe
the
smell
but
its
clean
and
fresh
i
really
like
this
one
ive
switched
to
this
from
sam
adams
boston
ale
as
my
default
brew
with
food
or
just
by
itself
overall
a
cheap
and
strong
beer
but
lacks
in
complexity
soft
amber
in
color
with
near
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
short
offwhite
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
caramel
malt
toffee
and
ripe
fruit
aromas
blend
very
nicely
with
delicate
floral
notes
in
the
background
soft
silky
smooth
feel
with
creamy
rich
carbonation
sweet
caramel
malt
and
toffee
flavors
up
front
with
a
tangy
floral
hop
bite
through
the
middle
toasted
malt
flavors
follow
the
tangy
hop
bite
as
this
finishes
semidry
with
a
lingering
biscuity
floral
hop
bitterness
altbiers
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
do
like
this
one
good
cold
weather
brew
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
pours
thick
and
milk
chocolate
brown
color
lets
just
a
little
light
through
and
sports
a
lasting
two
inch
head
smells
like
dark
german
malts
caramel
and
crusty
bread
the
flavor
is
very
malt
forward
without
much
sweetness
the
alcohol
content
is
very
well
hidden
it
can
be
felt
but
not
tasted
mouthfeel
works
well
rich
and
creamy
beer
but
somehow
drinkable
to
the
max
full
bodied
but
not
heavy
moderate
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
best
long
trail
brew
is
my
opinion
and
im
glad
they
started
making
it
available
all
year
great
with
a
nice
hearty
meal
on
an
early
fall
night
bottle
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
clear
amber
with
a
thick
lingering
offwhite
head
good
lacing
notes
of
malt
biscuit
maybe
something
like
a
dark
fruit
in
there
no
real
hop
notes
coming
through
sweet
tasting
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
gradually
builds
very
smooth
beer
highly
drinkable
considering
the
high
alcohol
content
and
initial
sweetness
o
delicious
altbier
highly
drinkable
alcohol
is
masked
well
definitely
one
of
the
best
examples
ive
had
for
this
style
originally
reviewed
07132011
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
a
pretty
good
example
for
the
style
though
im
probably
a
little
more
harsh
in
reviewing
it
than
others
after
having
spent
a
couple
of
weeks
in
dusseldorf
drinking
altbiers
the
beer
pours
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
bland
with
some
biscuit
malt
and
not
much
else
the
flavor
is
also
lacking
with
some
bread
grain
and
a
hint
of
grass
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
much
going
on
here
bought
a
sixpack
at
table
and
vine
has
a
light
clearbrown
appearance
with
a
lasting
lacing
on
the
side
aromas
are
quite
strong
with
alcohol
malt
caramel
and
some
fruit
flavoring
maybe
some
burnt
sugar
or
a
maple
flavor
taste
is
great
with
a
sweet
definitely
maple
flavor
mouthfeel
has
a
slight
dairy
feel
but
it
is
pretty
light
and
drinkable
overall
a
fantastic
drink
notes
drank
on
552012
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
light
to
moderate
carbonation
of
the
soft
concentrated
variety
surprisingly
good
beer
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
definitely
a
beer
that
tilts
toward
the
malty
side
of
the
scale
but
without
becoming
sickly
sweet
and
it
still
has
some
balance
at
the
end
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
bottled
on
leap
day
2012
pours
a
clear
orange

3
inch
sticky
off

all
over
smell

carmel
brown
sugar
some
pine
hops
and
figs
taste
is
very
balanced
lots
of
malts
with
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
body
is
medium
large
plenty
of
life
more
lush
than
dry
and
very
drinkable
this
is
very
nice
i
remember
when
this
beer
seemed
giant
now
it
is
easy
going
down
o
juxtaposes
a
variety
of
flavors
yet
ends
up
being
simple
and
accessible
and
just
remarkably
pleasant
no
matter
what
your
level
of
sophistication
or
momentary
proclivities
may
be
beautiful
o
aww
i
dont
want
to
leave
on
a
negative
note
so
ill
say
that
i
like
you
a
lot
long
trail
but
i
think
id
rather
stick
with
your
flagship
brew
double
bag
aint
bad
but
if
i
want
something
on
the
slightly
stronger
slightly
sweeter
side
i
think
id
rather
have
a
gearys
hampshire
special
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
very
concentrated
and
well
blended
flavors
deep
complexity
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
a
touch
of
phenolics
some
dark
fruit
enough
floral
hop
bitterness
to
make
the
finish
clean
and
dry
not
a
touch
of
detectable
alcohol
which
is
impressive
my
standard
go
to
beer
at
my
local
watering
hole
since
they
have
it
on
tap
good
stuff
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
bright
crisp
orangecopper
coloring
with
a
bit
of
filmy
head
on
the
pour
that
disappears
almost
instantly
leaving
behind
a
ring
of
film
around
the
edge
of
the
surface
caramel
and
toffee
aromas
richly
sweeten
the
slight
toasting
on
the
nose
flavors
are
rich
and
smooth
with
a
creamy
blending
of
cream
and
toffee
forming
the
backbone
toasty
rich
overtones
with
a
sweetness
similar
to
sugardaddy
the
aftertaste
is
toffee
rich
with
a
crisp
roasted
finish
very
tasty
brew
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
with
the
richness
of
the
flavors
oa
good
beer
that
i
wish
has
a
little
more
bite
overall
very
nicely
done
beer
a
little
sneaky
with
this
abv
but
the
flavors
work
very
well
from
the
bottle
nice
flavors
and
drinkability
here
i
am
surprised
by
the
abv
cant
even
tell
its
7
2
this
is
a
good
session
brew
a
good
malt
heavy
brew
when
you
desire
all
malts
very
good
stuff
here
o
decent
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
most
of
the
german
styles
because
i
think
they
lack
the
full
flavor
i
am
looking
for
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
an
iced
teaish
brown
color
with
a
12
finger
foam
that
settles
into
a
medium
collar
carbonation
appears
to
be
very
light
not
many
bubbles
aroma
is
of
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
1st
sip
brings
a
rather
dry
flavor
that
somewhat
belies
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
right
down
the
middle
not
heavy
or
watery
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
im
pretty
new
to
beer
tasting
so
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
some
tasting
notes
on
the
long
trail
website
you
get
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
taste
and
burn
at
the
end
of
the
sip
as
well
but
the
velvety
smooth
rich
malty
taste
melded
together
with
that
slight
herbal
hop
quality
will
definitely
have
me
getting
this
beer
again
in
the
future
overall
its
pretty
good
but
not
spectacular
o
i
enjoy
trying
altbiers
and
long
trails
version
is
very
nice
the
caramel
flavors
really
stand
out
and
are
supported
nicely
throughout
the
beer
pours
a
rusty
copper
color
with
almost
zero
head
in
my
snifter
glass
minimal
lacing
as
well
this
beer
is
fairly
clear
in
spite
of
the
fact
its
a
darker
beer
the
nose
is
caramel
malt
nutty
aroma
and
thats
about
it
fairly
weak
nose
on
this
beer
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
thrown
in
the
feel
is
thin
with
a
nutty
aftertaste
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
the
style
though
cheers
o
this
is
a
good
beer
for
its
style
and
good
to
me
notes
nice
surprise
finding
this
on
tap
locally
was
very
pleasing
id
sure
love
to
try
a
bottled
version
overall
enjoyable
american
try
of
a
rare
german
style
easy
drinking
tasty
brew
with
lots
of
flavors
dancing
on
your
tongue
only
thing
kind
of
disappointing
is
the
nose
isnt
as
good
as
the
taste
buds
say
it
is
o
very
good
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
other
then
that
solid
o
overall
this
one
is
a
keeper
i
first
bought
a
case
last
year
and
was
extremely
impressed
its
no
surprise
that
i
had
no
apprehension
in
picking
it
up
again
this
winter
as
well
i
imagine
i
will
purchase
it
again
in
the
future
very
nice
work
long
trail
d
an
intriguingly
sweet
richly
malty
sticke
style
alt
certainly
not
as
darkly
or
robustly
malty
as
many
stabs
at
the
substyle
but
rich
nonetheless
i
like
the
estery
fruity
sweetness
very
drinkable
and
potent
with
a
well

abv
o
just
a
really
tasty
beer
ive
only
had
the
hibernator
before
this
i
was
a
little
worried
it
wouldnt
be
to
my
taste
due
to
my
preference
for
porters
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
a
caveat
it
is
very
filling
i
would
recommend
taking
ones
time
with
it
overall
ive
not
had
this
style
before
and
that
will
change
starting
this
weekend
very
good
beer
especially
on
a
cold
winter
night
o
a
really
nice
beer
for
the
post
winter
months
well
crafted
i
paid
7
99
for
a
six
pack
and
feel
like
i
just
robbed
a
bank
a
big
cheers
to
long
trail
for
making
a
mighty
fine
altbier
er
stickebier
according
to
the
label
i
think
i
found
a
new
go
to
beer
i
must
keep
a
few
of
these
around
at
all
times
price
point
single
purchased
for
1
79
cool
sticke
o
a
better
than
decent
beer
though
ill
admit
im
not
entirely
familiar
with
the
style
or
the
substyle
o
this
is
a
focused
well
made
likeable
beer
d
theres
nothing
here
for
me
to
get
too
excited
about
but
its
balanced
and
lacks
flaws
so
i
could
have
a
few
more
and
it
was
worth
the
addition
to
the
mix
and
match
six
pack
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
caramel
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
grains
some
sweetness
taste
is
malts
grains
some
bitterness
at
the
finish
different
but
in
a
good
way
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
91
very
nice
worth
getting
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
even
though
there
was
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
taste
and
mouthfeel
made
up
for
that
characteristic
will
enjoy
more
of
these
in
the
future
nice
clear
amber
in
appearance
this
beer
has
a
nice
aroma
that
serves
it
well
the
feel
on
the
mouth
is
ok
lingers
a
little
but
not
to
bad
the
taste
is
very
nice
and
clean
overall
we
feel
that
long
trail
has
done
it
again
nice
beer
this
beer
will
go
well
with
a
good
sweet
ham
or
pork
chop
d
this
one
might
throw
off
people
who
arent
accustomed
to
bold
and
complex
brews
would
not
recommend
as
a
first
or
even
30th
beer
for
a
beginner
but
longtime
enthusiasts
can
easily
find
something
to
get
behind
within
this
one
o
the
only
other
beer
of
this
style
i
have
had
is
alaskan
amber
and
this
compares
very
nicely
with
it
not
up
to
par
with
it
but
still
a
pretty
good
beer
readily
available
and
fairly
cheap
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
o
a
very
light
beer
the
wateriness
is
not
pleasant
the
malt
flavors
would
be
nice
but
they
die
out
far
to
quickly
and
there
is
no
complexity
to
the
flavor
not
very
drinkable
my
second
bottle
was
better
my
fiancée
finally
put
some
shoes
on
very
nice
beer
for
the
style
o
a
singular
beer
for
the
most
part
not
too
many
other
locals
like
this
one
always
worth
a
buy
great
to
have
a
few
of
but
it
sneaks
up
on
you
quick
overall
a
very
nice
little
brew
cheap
and
available
in
nyc
and
big
bonus
points
to
ltbc
for
adding
such
an
overlooked
style
in
their
regular
lineup
for
an
alt
especially
a
sticke
version
this
is
pretty
tame
stuff
smells
of
caramel
malt
and
little
else
taste
is
again
pretty
malty
but
theres
just
not
a
lot
going
on
here
buttery
and
bready
with
very
light
leafy
and
baked
apple
notes
clean
and
crisp
for
sure
obviously
a
brew
constructed
with
care
but
not
something
id
revisit
the
sweet
honeylike
malty
backbone
could
easily
double
as
a
dopple
bock
the
german
citrusy
and
metallic
tangy
nobles
hops
and
alt
yeast
are
what
keeps
this
in
the
altbier
family
the
7
2
abv
makes
it
a
sticke
bottoms
up
final
thoughts
this
is
good
simplicity
not
folling
with
out
there
flavors
just
making
a
good
brew
enjoy
this
one
deep
in
the
fallstart
of
winter
it
would
be
perfect
great
brew
long
trail
im
usually
unimpressed
with
long
trail
but
this
is
actually
a
quality
beer
its
really
tasty
try
the
triple
bag
overall
this
beer
is
stunning
im
currently
doing
a
road
trip
thru
the
north
east
and
turning
it
into
a
beercation
so
now
my
big
dilemma
is
should
i
continue
sampling
other
ne
brews
or
should
i
head
back
to
sam
the
beer
man
in
binghamton
and
buy
a
shitload
more
double
bag
longtrail
oh
how
i
suffer
overall
a
bit
much
for
me
taste
is
overly
sweet
and
leaves
you
feeling
very
heavy
first
time
i
had
one
of
these
was
by
surprise
i
dont
think
i
finished
it
decided
to
give
it
another
chance
when
i
wasnt
already
drinking
still
a
no
i
wont
get
this
again
this
is
one
really
tasty
altbier
for
sure
this
is
a
great
brew
i
would
certainly
consider
adding
this
to
my
regular
rotation
the
stronger
abv
is
well
hidden
making
this
a
very
enjoyable
brew
for
anytime
of
the
year
o
this
is
a
great
great
beer
its
the
first
german
alt
ive
ever
had
so
im
not
sure
about
style
guidelines
but
id
definitely
buy
more
of
this
lots
of
complex
flavors
and
they
come
together
well
overall
a
very
nice
altbier
doesnt
move
the
earth
but
its
tasty
a
very
solid
offering
from
long
trail
o
im
enjoying
this
beer
more
now
that
im
really
paying
attention
to
it
but
i
still
dont
think
this
beer
is
anything
more
than
an
enjoyable
yet
unremarkable
new
england
local
its
pretty
easy
to
find
double
bag
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
so
if
youre
up
here
it
may
be
worth
trying
a
bottle
but
otherwise
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
it
alcohol
of
7
2
is
not
noticed
in
the
nose
or
taste
but
does
show
up
with
a
warming
after
glow
another
fun
find
on
tap
at
my
place
in
newtown
ct
this
one
shows
a
deep
copper
color
clear
with
yellow
highlights
a
decent
white
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
says
wheat
and
thin
yeasty
malt
not
my
favorite
but
reasonable
for
the
style
i
suppose
the
flavor
brings
lemony
malt
and
honey
sweetness
theres
a
little
licorice
edge
almost
a
bock
interesting
and
consistent
with
my
previous
enjoyment
form
bottles
its
mediumlight
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
and
a
fairly
aqueous
feel
its
got
a
tart
quality
a
bit
of
citrous
hops
perhaps
but
very
subtle
nice
drinkable
brew
with
some
personality
o
pretty
forgettable
o
this
may
or
may
not
be
the
only
altbier
i
have
had
either
way
it
is
a
nice
refreshing
brew
could
and
have
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
poured
into
my
ccb
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
no
head
aroma
of
caramel
malts
sweetness
taste
follows
the
nose
slight
amount
of
hops
present
sweet
beer
easy
to
drink
hides
alcohol
well
not
bad
at
all
just
not
a
lot
of
complexity
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
nice
and
complex
and
very
balanced
at
the
same
time
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
with
very
nice
balance
nutty
up
front
with
some
cranberry
very
smooth
though
as
it
coats
the
mouth
with
malty
buttery
bread
notes
ends
dry
with
a
bite
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
an
excellent
brew
my
cousin
picked
up
a
bottle
and
we
split
it
between
ourselves
the
color
was
pretty
nice
it
poured
as
a
transparent
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
tan
head
on
it
that
turned
into
just
a
little
film
over
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
mostly
grains
and
malts
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
light
i
wasnt
able
to
really
pull
too
much
from
the
flavors
in
there
besides
some
grains
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
drinkable
this
brew
didnt
really
impress
me
all
that
much
id
try
it
again
if
i
could
pours
a
filtered
clear
copper
with
a
bubbly
thick
creamy
head
long
lasting
retention
with
foamy
clumps
of
lacing
aroma
is
caramel
and
nutty
malt
light
butterscotch
and
faint
leafy
hops
creamy
smooth
body
with
light
carbonation
and
a
sticky
butterscotch
sweet
finish
toffee
and
caramel
malt
sweetness
dominate
the
flavor
with
a
leafy
and
earthy
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
but
not
particularly
bitter
a
little
sweet
but
the
depth
of
the
toasted
malts
are
pleasant
and
is
the
best
long
trail
beer
ive
had
to
date
poured
a
burnt
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
layer
of
a
head
toasted
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
caramel
malts
on
the
tongue
with
light
graininess
and
some
hop
bitterness
balancing
things
out
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
but
overall
drinkable
nice
light
body
on
this
a
little
bit
on
the
side
of
low
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
hear
im
relativly
unfamiliar
with
the
style
so
id
be
interested
to
see
a
few
more
the
hops
are
somewhat
subdued
but
then
again
so
are
the
malts
a
very
drinkable
but
not
particularly
memorable
beer
for
me
grabbed
one
of
these
at
the
foundry
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
lot
of
frothy
head
a
pretty
light
and
simple
body
a
balanced
amount
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
floral
hop
aroma
the
hops
are
subdued
compared
to
the
malty
sweetness
malts
are
present
but
take
a
back
seat
to
the
hops
in
the
taste
however
the
body
is
balanced
well
a
toasty
body
that
compliments
the
pretty
intense
hop
flavors
o
good
stuff
i
had
some
wasabi
mix
on
hand
which
was
a
good
choice
this
is
a
nice
strong
brew
from
long
trail
that
always
hides
its
true
abv
d
nice
complete
flavors
it
tends
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
which
makes
it
a
bit
less
drinkable
than
the
flavor
warrants
dr
so
very
easy
to
drink
this
love
it
a
pretty
interesting
and
different
beer
that
i
quite
enjoyed
nice
amber
color
but
thin
quickly
disappearing
head
smell
wasnt
great
kind
of
metallic
taste
was
nice
creamy
and
malt
with
some
late
hoppy
and
alcohol
hints
mouthfeel
was
milky
with
light
cling
very
drinkable
recommend
a
few
at
a
time
to
get
good
feel
for
it
overall
i
like
this
beer
very
much
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
long
trail
in
my
opinion
good
and
interesting
beer
cheers
d
a
nicely
balanced
flavorful
beer
some
enjoyable
subtletycomplexity
to
this
one
but
its
a
pretty
easy
drinker
and
a
nice
version
of
a
somewhat
uncommon
style
accessible
for
being
a
fairly
big
beer
unfortunately
thats
the
only
drawback
to
this
beer
its
strong
but
you
wont
realize
it
until
the
whole
bottle
is
down
and
the
alcohol
kicks
in
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
session
beer
but
this
isnt
one
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
not
if
i
was
out
with
my
friends
for
the
wintertime
when
youre
stuck
at
home
this
is
a
great
choice
to
warm
up
and
mellow
out
to
its
a
shame
that
this
style
isnt
more
readily
available
around
here
but
theres
no
need
to
worry
long
trail
has
it
nailed
and
for
any
lovers
of
altbiers
this
will
suffice
quite
nicely
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
drink
is
decent
a
slight
bit
of
booze
but
good
for
7
2
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
minerality
the
herbal
hop
flavors
dont
go
as
well
as
i
remember
in
fact
this
beer
is
not
as
much
like
i
remember
it
i
remember
it
being
a
lot
more
malty
perhaps
my
tastes
are
a
lot
different
and
more
in
tune
or
perhaps
it
has
to
do
with
the
freshness
as
i
was
probably
used
to
drinking
older
ones
and
this
was
bottled
122210
so
barely
5
weeks
old
an
interesting
beer
lots
of
sweetness
without
being
too
cloying
more
caramel
and
estery
maybe
not
estery
actually
but
might
be
from
the
hops
d
high
alcohol
percentage
notwithstanding
it
goes
down
very
nicely
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
waiting
to
try
another
double
alt
pours
a
light
brown
color
into
the
glass
my
glass
had
a
very
small
amount
of
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
smells
immediately
of
bready
biscuit
some
caramel
and
toffee
light
floral
notes
are
present
as
well
upon
drinking
i
sense
a
big
malt
backbone
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
really
standing
out
also
a
hint
of
honey
really
smooth
beer
drinks
incredibly
easily
i
cant
believe
the
abv
is
over
7
drinks
more
like
a
beer
around
4
feels
like
a
top
notch
session
beer
with
the
abv
so
well
hidden
just
dont
let
it
sneak
up
on
you
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
golden
color
and
it
poured
a
thin
brown
head
the
head
was
gone
instantly
the
beer
had
a
caramel
smell
with
a
big
hoppy
smell
sitting
on
top
of
that
caramel
notes
on
the
finish
but
hops
blew
that
away
i
will
not
buy
again
pours
a
golden
light
brown
with
good
tan
head
and
carbonation
on
top
of
a
candisugar
sweet
malt
aroma
like
caramel
and
toffee
the
beer
is
real
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
good
sweet
malt
taste
of
caramel
and
toffee
a
i
swear
im
picking
up
vanilla
a
bready
dryness
is
evident
as
well
maybe
a
roastedtoasted
malt
as
well
as
some
stickiness
picking
up
minor
hop
fruit
flavors
that
are
bitter
and
i
think
im
getting
some
apple
must
say
the
higher
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
beer
has
a
good
dry
yet
crisp
finish
dvery
drinkable
so
far
the
best
offering
from
long
trail
i
was
reluctant
to
pick
this
up
after
having
tried
their
ale
ipa
belgian
white
and
blackberry
beers
in
a
mix
pack
but
this
one
was
great
aromas
of
sweet
biscuity
maltiness
and
significant
notes
of
earthy
herbal
and
citrus
hops
a
slight
caramel
taste
with
a
bitter
and
sweet
aftertaste
malts
were
evident
and
pretty
sweet
but
the
taste
of
caramel
was
more
evident
a
pretty
equal
balance
upon
further
review
though
malty
at
first
sip
hop
bitterness
follows
quickly
the
alcohol
warmth
isnt
strong
but
is
quite
pleasant
i
would
describe
it
as
slippery
mediumbodied
and
yet
at
the
same
time
enormously
clean
and
refreshing
a
good
solid
hops
slight
maltiness
hints
of
fruits
and
some
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer
that
comes
very
close
to
being
excellent
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
small
white
head
that
settles
into
a
collar
the
nose
has
some
honey
and
grain
but
not
much
else
flavors
of
bold
toasty
and
caramel
malts
that
are
perfectly
balanced
with
a
woody
tealike
bitterness
elegant
in
its
simple
but
balanced
flavor
construction
d
very
drinkable
disguises
the
abv
well
flavorful
smooth
and
balanced
d
a
pretty
good
alt
didnt
blow
me
away
and
not
my
favorite
beer
from
long
trail
but
its
well
made
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
would
drink
again
transparent
amber
with
a
beige
head
smells
is
herbal
not
anything
offensive
but
nothing
outstanding
either
taste
is
bitter
sweet
pleasantly
so
has
a
bit
of
a
burn
i
could
drink
this
one
down
easily
id
recommend
this
to
someone
looking
for
something
different
long
trail
has
a
winner
here
lots
of
complex
fruit
esters
melded
with
an
excellent
malt
profile
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
his
stuff
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
just
enough
bite
to
it
and
plenty
of
taste
to
it
beer
is
nice
its
a
great
great
alt
medium
bodied
interesting
late
flavors
from
the
yeast
mild

mild

nice

a
great
beer
all
around
ruby
red
in
sunlight
my
goto
for
quite
a
while
about
sixer
per
week
overtones
of
caramel
and
molasses
sweet
malty
body
overall
a
strong
reliable
and
distinctive
ale
accessible
enough
for
guests
you
may
have
at
dinner
but
not
quite
complex
enough
to
inspire
mystery
in
this
noob
d
pretty
drinkable
for
a
7
2
abv
great
flavors
and
very
easy
to
drink
worth
looking
for
o
this
is
a
nostalgic
beer
for
me
my
wife
and
i
went
camping
in
canada
and
split
a
warm
sixer
of
this
after
sitting
in
the
front
row
of
the
sting
annie
lennox
concert
i
will
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
good
stuff
d
for
a
high
abv
beer
this
is
unbelievably
drinkable
the
alcohol
content
is
almost
undetectable
which
makes
this
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
pour
is
a
light
amber
with
some
brown
streaks
white
head
the
nose
is
a
bit
nutty
with
some
slightlytoasted
malt
caramel
and
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
light
malt
chopped
peanuts
toffee
and
light
earth
decent
body
one
of
the
better
brews
that
ive
had
from
long
trail
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
definitely
drinkable
this
would
make
a
good
fall
six
pack
the
drink
on
this
one
might
be
a
little
high
for
some
its
a
stong
drink
if
you
havent
had
a
altbier
like
this
before
its
a
great
brew
for
those
who
seek
out
this
kind
style
not
quite
what
you
expect
from
a
altbier
though
seems
to
be
a
bit
on
there
own
style
still
a
decent
brew
i
would
certianly
have
again
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
an
affordable
one
as
well
also
widely
available
in
my
area
and
a
great
value
for
the
abv
d
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
overall
but
a
nice
beer
that
should
be
tried
poured
from
a
bottle
a
light
brown
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
rapidly
dissolves
to
just
a
sparsely
bubbled
coat
sweet
malty
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
a
mouth
full
of
bready
malts
honey
and
some
earthy
hops
lightmedium
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
very
deceptive
at
7
2
easy
drinking
beer
long
trails
describes
this
as
a
strong
ale
but
here
its
an
altbier
not
what
i
would
typically
consider
mistakable
for
a
strong
ale
final
note
fall
certainly
comes
to
mind
with
this
one
but
id
enjoy
one
no
matter
the
season
gotta
say
this
beer
impressed
me
malty
and
sweet
with
some
biscuity
yeast
flavors
low
level
of
carbonation
helps
create
a
nice
creamy
dry
finish
def
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
in
the
mix
too
this
reminds
me
of
a
really
good
flavorful
marzen
typically
not
a
long
trail
fan
but
this
is
a
good
brew
also
the
7
2
abv
is
well
hiddenvery
drinkable
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
but
i
just
dont
it
doesnt
seem
to
me
like
they
stayed
true
to
the
styler
either
it
seems
like
they
tried
to
do
something
a
touch
different
which
is
commendable
unfortunaely
risk
sometimes
rewards
and
sometimes
it
doesnt
i
dont
think
that
it
has
this
time
di
enjoy
the
taste
but
for
me
the
drinkablility
is
not
extremely
high
a
bit
too
boozey
and
not
my
favorite
style
but
still
goes
down
easy
enough
goes
down
well
very
well
for
a
7
beer
where
the
booze
stays
in
the
background
as
a
supporting
feature
one
of
the
better
alt
biers
i
have
had
and
one
i
shouldnt
pass
over
so
often
i
would
say
this
beer
hits
the
spot
after
a
long
day
raking
leaves
quality
product
absolutely
cant
believe
its
7
2
tastes
much
softer
that
being
said
excellent
strong
brew
mine
had
great
head
but
not
so
much
lace
great
autumn
brew
note
i
have
had
this
beer
in
both
12
oz
bottles
and
22
oz
bottles
the
22
oz
bottles
always
taste
better
and
less
bitter
i
have
no
idea
why
but
this
has
been
consistant
over
multiple
trails
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
plenty
rich
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
i
did
not
notice
the
7
2
at
all
i
suppose
it
is
necessary
to
get
the
good
strong
flavor
i
would
drink
a
few
of
these
very
nice
dont
notice
the
7
abv
alcohol
at
all
dvery
drinkable
it
goes
down
very
smooth
i
am
very
glad
i
had
the
oppertunity
to
try
this
thanks
jason
holla
lol
impression
with
fine
examples
like
this
it
is
mysterious
how
this
style
isnt
more
popular
hv
a
nice
refreshing
brew
with
a
slight
amber
color
to
it
a
slight
taste
of
carmel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
slight
bitter
after
taste
that
goes
away
quickly
it
goes
well
with
most
meals
ive
had
it
with
and
doesnt
overpower
the
food
also
oddly
refreshing
a
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
overall
an
interesting
beer
for
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
is
a
good
beer
to
just
relax
with
its
smooth
refreshing
and
full
of
flavor
everything
i
look
for
in
a
beer
minimal
head
but
beautiful
dark
amber
color
fruityspicy
nose
smooth
mouthfeel
i
did
get
a
hint
more
alcohol
on
the
palate
which
is
the
only
thing
that
kept
my
taste
rating
at
4
instead
of
4
5
but
overall
this
was
a
very
good
brew
d
a
great
beer
if
youre
in
high
school
otherwise
a
pretty
shallow
offering
kinda
gross
real
musty
not
fresh
tasting
at
all
imagine
licking
a
storm
cellar
thats
never
been
frequented
in
20
years
yeah
from
a
12
oz
bottle
to
a
glass
rich
copper
color
minimal
head
very
clear
indeed
smells
of
molasses
and
caramel
nice
malt
undertones
taste
is
rich
and
thick
no
real
hop
taste
or
bitterness
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
the
taste
that
lingers
is
less
pleasant
than
the
initial
taste
more
metallic
drinkability
is
average
due
to
its
heaviness
but
still
lovely
everything
is
so
understated
in
this
one
that
it
would
be
easy
to
overlook
as
a
relatively
boring
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
attention
the
complexity
however
is
more
obvious
d
easy
to
drink
and
very
smooth
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
if
you
take
your
time
with
them
just
can
get
very
filling
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
taste
didnt
quite
life
up
to
the
smell
but
this
was
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
but
also
fairly
complex
overall
really
enjoyed
this
a
bit
high
in
the
alcohol
range
but
it
doesnt
stick
out
too
badly
just
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
with
a
medium
finish
i
really
like
the
flavors
and
the
contrasts
in
this
beer
it
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
i
am
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
an
awesome
beer
the
first
one
i
have
tried
from
long
trail
and
apparently
after
this
one
i
need
to
try
more
a
delicious
blend
of
sweet
gloriousness
in
a
glass
its
a
hit
long
trail
never
fail
this
beer
best
in
bombers
looks
beautiful
a
lot
of
beers
are
said
to
look
amber
there
is
a
huge
array
natural
amber
color
and
tones
even
green
from
certain
places
in
the
caribbean
and
europe
that
being
said
this
is
what
most
people
think
of
when
they
think
amber
its
clear
and
you
can
see
right
through
but
the
color
like
honey
amber
its
head
isnt
overwhelming
but
present
and
honey
white
in
color
it
smell
like
none
other
its
mild
almost
sweet
and
smells
somewhat
like
bananas
the
taste
is
good
it
not
harsh
in
any
way
it
doesnt
taste
nearly
as
alcoholic
as
it
is
again
like
its
smell
its
somewhat
sweet
but
no
banana
taste
so
far
as
i
can
tell
the
mouthfeel
is
strong
and
crisp
the
way
i
like
it
overall
this
beer
is
very
very
drinkable
so
much
so
that
you
might
not
realize
its
high
alcohol
content
after
putting
back
a
several
pints
until
the
buzz
hits
you
strongly
delicious
thank
you
long
trail
good
beer
different
than
what
i
usually
drink
malty
smooth
almost
carmel
tasting
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
about
it
was
the
finish
goes
down
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
taste
left
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
at
the
end
could
be
the
malt
that
stays
there
a
while
all
in
all
a
good
beer
easy
to
drink
great
pour
and
amber
color
and
body
i
would
get
this
again
strong
abv
as
well
gives
a
good
buzz
cheers
really
refreshing
for
a
7
abv
and
quite
drinkable
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
with
this
one
as
a
friend
dropped
it
off
in
my
fridge
about
3
months
ago
and
im
just
getting
around
to
trying
the
hops
have
really
held
up
well
oh
how
i
love
me
a
double
bagger
obviously
youre
dealing
with
a
strong
brew
here
but
fortunatly
not
with
the
negative
side
affects
that
usually
accompany
one
pours
a
robust
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
solid
long
lasting
head
clearly
brings
the
funk
but
finishes
with
the
grace
of
a
lawrence
taylor
half
time
crack
hit
if
oe
or
steel
reserve
were
to
get
you
drunk
with
class
and
quality
ingrediants
they
would
do
it
along
the
lines
of
a
double
bag
press
play
on
the
cow
phunk
and
let
me
ride
baby
an
excellent
after
beer
after
snowboarding
not
particularly
drinkable
the
flavors
are
simple
and
strong
more
than
pleasant
and
interesting
drinkability
a
great
beer
allround
i
read
a
bit
about
the
style
altsticke
kinda
thing
bottle
says
strong
ale
this
is
a
beer
that
really
crosses
styles
brown
ale
alt
strong
ale
overall
its
a
really
subtle
brew
and
also
a
very
strong
one
youll
never
notice
the
abv
in
taste
or
aroma
but
itll
sneak
up
on
you
never
sweet
or
bitter
malty
with
faded
floral
and
fruit
notes
a
relaxed
brew
with
a
higher
alcohol
content
i
recommend
drinking
this
on
a
cold
night
when
youre
not
feeling
something
as
complex
as
an
imperial
stout
barleywine
or
dark
belgians
a
good
brew
but
certainly
more
american
than
alt
from
the
22
fl
oz
bottle
with
a
marking
of
1102092226
sampled
on
january
25
2010
served
at
about
45
degrees
it
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
color
with
fantastic
clarity
and
about
two
fingers
of
fronty
foamy
soapy
offwhite
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
the
aroma
is
not
terribly
enticing
and
quite
frankly
reminded
me
of
paint
thinner
with
a
dash
of
floral
hops
but
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
turned
around
the
initial
impression
with
a
medium
chewy
mouthfeel
and
a
mildly
hopped
taste
with
a
dry
finish
once
i
got
around
the
aroma
i
liked
it
very
nice
overall
sweet
malty
flavor
but
not
outstanding
in
any
way
an
enjoyable
beer
with
midrange
flavor
thats
quite
drinkable
considering
the
abv
but
its
just
above
average
tastewise
ah
double
bag
how
youve
let
me
down
i
really
used
to
love
this
beer
and
now
it
seems
it
isnt
quite
as
good
as
i
remember
kind
of
tastes
like
a
shipyard
or
something
not
what
it
used
to
be
but
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
though
somewhat
doughy
to
finish
this
is
still
an
enjoyable
if
heay
quaff
for
any
cold
winter
afternoon
or
perhaps
after
a
day
on
vermonts
verdant
slopes
see
also
my
beerfly
review
for
long
trail
all
around
good
beer
but
the
constant
theme
is
that
the
last
taste
is
far
worse
than
the
first
drinkability
unique
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
then
1
so
i
would
say
it
is
low
as
i
progress
through
the
multitude
of
beers
and
ales
of
the
world
i
find
beers
ive
never
seen
before
and
try
them
out
this
one
was
a
great
find
nice
pour
nice
color
nice
flavor
interesting
bottle
labels
all
aimed
at
catching
and
holding
the
beer
drinker
who
can
resist
a
double
udder
cow
more
and
more
i
find
the
microbrews
best
with
most
of
the
big
beers
a
waste
of
money
having
a
recent
trip
to
germany
with
octoberfest
a
big
part
of
it
this
one
would
meet
the
german
taste
test
easily
honeybiscuit
malt
base
with
a
twang
of
spicy
vegetal
hops
on
the
finish
tinge
of
sour
whiskey
mash
on
the
finish
lets
you
know
the
alcohol
is
working
while
the
yeast
adds
some
fruitiness
malts
are
big
and
chewy
on
the
palate
with
a
creaminess
that
plays
well
off
the
wellcarbonated
body
overall
a
very
solid
altbier
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
with
each
sipthis
thing
is
going
so
fast
that
i
could
burn
through
a
750ml
without
even
blinking
d
i
think
i
like
a
pretty
nicedrinking
beer
definitely
the
better
of
the
several
long
trail
brews
ive
had
so
far
t
very
solid
malt
taste
thick
fullbodied
and
has
a
strong
alcohol
taste
to
it
would
be
perfect
if
the
malt
and
alcohol
were
dialed
down
just
a
hair
drinkability
perfectly
priced
brew
for
what
you
get
its
a
nice
addition
to
the
winter
lineup
but
something
i
would
stay
away
from
in
the
warmer
months
as
its
a
bit
cloying
and
coating
on
the
palate
and
the
boos
comes
through
a
tad
too
much
i
would
love
to
try
an
aged
one
though
d
a
great
beer
to
come
home
to
at
the
end
of
the
day
very
smooth
tasty
and
filling
its
malt
reminds
me
of
a
oktoberfest
great
beer
but
not
the
best
buy
again
no
pours
a
nice
bright
copper
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
quickly
recedes
leaving
some
nice
lacing
along
the
glass
smells
pretty
good
sweet
bready
caramel
malts
dominate
with
a
some
faint
hops
in
the
background
not
really
too
much
going
on
here
taste
is
similar
to
smell
a
good
strong
malty
background
provides
most
of
the
flavor
here
a
nice
toasted
caramel
with
hints
of
toffee
as
well
just
hints
of
floral
grassy
hops
provide
some
balance
has
a
nice
full
body
to
it
and
its
very
smooth
going
down
every
sip
leaves
you
coming
back
for
more
this
is
my
first
long
trail
brew
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
had
this
at
bridgewaters
pub
at
amtrak
station
in
philadelphia
served
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
persisted
and
good
lace
color
was
a
medium
coppery
amber
aroma
is
caramel
toffee
malt
and
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
was
same
but
sweet
up
front
and
a
bitter
end
good
body
and
carbonation
short
finish
very
drinkable
session
beer
d
not
bad
ive
never
been
a
vermont
beer
fan
but
this
one
is
okay
d
abv
is
up
there
but
this
is
still
and
easy
drinker
the
taste
is
good
with
semidry
herbal
hops
with
slight
fruity
tinges
of
yeast
and
mild
caramel
body
with
slightly
creamy
malt
and
gentle
spice
in
the
hops
with
light
alcohol
taste
and
dark
cherry
element
from
the
yeast
the
finish
is
sweet
and
tangy
wtih
slight
tinge
of
alcohol
i
think
this
is
a
good
double
alt
with
nice
malt
but
doesnt
really
become
cloying
still
a
good
quaffer
even
though
it
appears
my
palate
may
have
changed
in
3
years
you
can
drink
3
of
these
before
you
know
what
has
caught
up
with
you
and
still
desire
more
drinkability
solid
if
a
bit
visceral
and
wild
though
theres
a
balance
issue
that
would
make
me
not
want
to
have
more
than
a
few
id
say
still
worth
a
shot
for
a
bottle
long
trail
never
lets
you
down
always
an
enjoyment
delicious
beer
d
definitely
something
i
could
drink
regularly
and
in
high
quantities
interestingly
this
is
described
on
the
label
as
a
double
alt
never
heard
that
term
before
so
ive
learned
something
new
anyway
you
catagorize
it
this
is
an
excllent
brew
deep
copper
color
great
looking
head
rich
malty
aroma
flavor
and
body
are
rich
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
pleasant
alcohol
warming
sensation
follows
each
swallow
hops
balance
things
out
nicely
good
drinkability
for
such
a
strong
rich
beer
d
a
good

gets
progressively
better

each

light

enjoyed
the
combination

i
am
just
not
getting

in

at

at
first
though
a

up

really
what
i
would
consider
an
american
strong

however
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
it
goes
down
easy
its
a
good
beer
nuff
said
the
funny
thing
is
that
throughout
enjoying
this
it
kept
on
reminding
me
of
lagunitas
products
perhaps
they
share
some
of
the
same
recipes
and
with
the
low
prices
they
at

have
to
be
very
similar

i
think
this
is
a
great
gateway
beer
for
people
the
body
is
not
that
heavy
but
the
flavor
is
up
there
at
7
it
will
be
bearable
for
those
just
getting
in
to
craft
beer
for
me
it
is
a
nice
beer
that
drinks
easier
than
it
should

hung
around

smell
brought
a
thick

followed
by

another

smooth
grainy
with
a
strong
presence
of
hops
finishing
with
a
bitter
taste
a
bit
complex
and
very
well
balanced
beer
well
carbonated
but
a
bit
overwhelming
the
drinkability
is
poorer
than
the
triple
bag
in
my
opinion
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
initial
entrance
on
the
tongue
is
uneventful
and
weak
but
it
does
improve
with
a
swish
and
it
remains
moderately
carbonated
the
harsh
whipping
flavors
dont
help
make
this
beer
a
truly
enjoyable
experience
drinkability
the
overall
impression
is
of
a
well
brewed
well
balanced
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
found
it
easy
to
drink
while
it
is
not
one
of
my
preferred
styles
it
could
grow
to
be
and
i
can
see
having
more
than
one
and
also
returning
to
it
in
the
future
overall
a
tasty
beer
easy
to
drink
given
its
size
its
a
nice
interpretation
to
this
catch
all
style
that
is
usually
overly
hopped
overall
a
great
complex
beer
not
similiar
to
anything
i
have
had
so
far
great
choice
for
a
session
brew
something
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
i
would
not
go
back
to
this
one
way
to
bitter
without
enough
taste
throughout
the
offset
it
overall
alts
especially
stong
alts
are
one
of
my
brewing
passions
and
americans
tend
to
butcher
them
so
ill
admit
i
was
expecting
the
worst
when
i
first
poured
this
beer
i
was
especially
nervous
after
reading
on
their
website
some
the
malts
mostly
tworow
and
crystal
rather
than
munich
and
hops
mt
hood
that
they
use
that
being
said
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
results
my
biggest
complaint
would
be
that
using
two
row
and
crystal
rather
than
munich
leaves
this
beer
more
sweet
than
bready
and
as
you
continue
to
drink
the
beer
this
leaves
it
a
bit
full
and
cloying
nonetheless
its
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
get
here
in
chicago
d
excellent
across
the
board
a
fantastic
brew
lts
best
offering
this
brew
is
very
good
bottled
when
its
fresh
on
tap
its
absolutely
freakin
fantastic
drinkability
definitely
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
balance
to
it
the
flavors
are
just
right
pours
a
clear
amber
with
1
finger
of
foamy
eggshell
colored
head
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
smells
of
caramel
clove
and
apples
tastes
of
toasted
grainy
malts
apples
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
very
bitter
pine
and
spicy
hop
finish
medium
in
body
with
average
carbonation
sticky
with
a
strong
dry
bitter
finish
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
want
too
often
a
little
too
much
bitterness
that
doesnt
really
mesh
well
with
the
other
flavors
d
an
enjoyable
malty
ale
with
an
interesting
hops
twist
a
nice
ale
with
a
wide
appeal
d
good
stuff
i
could
see
this
as
a
session
beer
if
i
was
in
the
mood
and
planned
on
slowsipping
only
a
few
glasses
during
an
evening
the
burnt
and
bitter
aftertaste
might
catch
up
on
me
in
the
long
run
though
to
me
the
flavors
dont
blend
or
balance
well
a
bit
too
dry
not
enough
body
glad
a
got
a
12oz
instead
of
22
sorry
to
say
d
for
a
7
20
abv
it
was
very
drinkable
leaves
a
sweet
then
slightly
bitter
taste
very
good
d
on
the
sweet
side
but
super
easy
for
me
to
drink
octoberfest
like
will
buy
again
possibly
a
six
pack
one
of
my
long
time
favorites
i
have
always
enjoyed
the
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
the
beer
left
a
2
head
in
a
beer
glass
with
a
lot
of
lacing
the
smell
is
of
malts
and
slightly
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
is
remarkable
its
very
malty
with
a
nice
sweetish
taste
to
it
that
has
a
little
alchohol
and
even
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
when
held
in
the
mouth
the
alchohol
taste
is
more
present
but
definatley
not
over
bearing
has
a
nice
aftertaste
almost
wheatish
that
makes
you
want
to
sip
again
the
beer
has
no
sign
of
being
7
2
by
drinking
alone
overall
this
was
a
pretty
simple
beer
thats
good
for
just
enjoying
and
not
thinking
aboutanalyzing
not
something
i
see
myself
visiting
often
or
possibly
ever
again
but
not
bad
i
have
to
remember
i
dont
like
this
tastes
like
an
agressive
sweet
fruitcake
heavy
sweet
caramel
with
lots
of
fruit
peaches
and
plums
mainly
and
citrus
hops
mild
alcoholic
giddiness
is
the
only
indication
of
a
7
2
abv
double
bag
is
a
great
session
ale
for
the
bravehearted
two
or
three
will
more
than
make
one
content
the
triple
bag
was
a
bit
too
rough
around
the
edges
but
this
one
hits
the
mark
deadon
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
made
this
beer
very
drinkable
pretty
easy
on
the
stomach
too
good
beer
overall
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
though

just
a
great
beer
that
is
hard
to
point
out
individual
details
but
is
just
an

beverage
that
always
leaves

smiling

satisfied

creamcolored

reminiscent
of

froth
all
sorts
of
authentic
smelling
german
malts
billowing
off
the
top
of
this
toffee
toast
caramel
and
a
bit
of
butter
round
out
the
nose
fruity
to
start
apple
going
into
dark
toast
and
caramel
and
finishing
off
with
a
subtle
flowery
bitterness
and
delicate
european
grain
note
a
somewhat
sharp
medium
carbonation
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
bit
of
warming
a
very
nice
drinking
ale
with
an
awesome
malt
profile
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
authentic
tasting
americanbrewed
german
style
ales
that
i
have
had
great
job
by
long
trail
on
producing
this
smooth
unique
ale

drinkability
at
7

this
is
very
sessionable
again
im
not
a
huge
long
trail
guy
but
like
the
hibernator
this
one
is
extremely
well
put
together
the
maltiness
in
this
one
is
a
huge
factor
in
that
its
not
overdrawn
and
it
pairs
perfect
with
the
amount
of
spices
at
hand
this
is
a
neat
beer
probably
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
was
exposed
to
as
a
youth
it
has
a
very
unique
flavor
and
is
ridiculously
drinkable
for
the
abv
pours
a
dark
copper
color
and
has
a
excellent
off
white
head
that
leave
decent
lacing
the
aroma
give
off
a
nice
mixture
of
smells
from
malt
to
citrus
to
hops
to
spices
as
for
the
taste
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
decent
warming
effect
to
it
quite
delicious
and
at
7
2
is
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
all
day
not
the
greatest
but
would
definitley
accept
as
a
gift
12
oz
bottle
browish
amber
pour
with
a
medium
tan
head
aroma
of
toffee
and
caramel
taste
of
malt
chocolate
caramel
and
brown
sugar
sticky
mouthfeel
but
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
great
full
finish
very
accessible
in
my
area
and
a
great
intro
to
altbiers
a
good
beer
not
sure
id
chase
it
but
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
id
be
very
happy
and
accept
their
gift
dude
i
dont
know
this
seems
to
be
a
wellliked
beer
but
i
just
wasnt
diggin
it
it
has
a
nice
clear
amber
color
but
the
head
was
smallish
and
didnt
hang
out
long
left
some
thin
strings
of
lace
very
malty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
hops
the
flavor
is
incredibly
malty
with
a
pronounced
fruitiness
and
some
grassy
hop
leaf
in
the
finish
but
what
i
really
get
in
the
finish
is
a
pretty
harsh
alcohol
presence
somewhat
bittering
and
unpleasant
the
feel
is
nice
smooth
and
soft
light
body
overall
i
found
the
second
half
of
the
glass
to
be
less
enjoyable
than
the
first
which
is
never
a
good
thing
the
malty
twang
becomes
a
bit
irritating
and
the
alcohol
is
harsh
for
all
my
criticism
its
not
a
terrible
beer
perhaps
its
just
the
style
that
i
dont
care
for
d
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
beer
is
significantly
more
palatable
after
a
few
months
in
the
cellar
the
pour
is
copper
in
color
light
head
smell
was
very
fruity
mostly
apple
the
alcohol
is
very
noticable
in
this
beer
but
is
not
over
powering
at
all
very
sweet
and
crisp
with
a
little
hop
at
the
end
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
will
drink
again
this
is
quite
a
solid
beer
at
first
i
was
thinking
that
it
was
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
the
toasted
grain
and
bitterness
complement
it
nicely
and
keep
it
quite
drinkable
good
stuff
id
certainly
have
again
clear
amber
with
thin
disappearing
head
weak
and
mildly
malty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
green
apple
starts
with
a
citrussy
bitterness
and
fruitiness
slight
peppery
alcohol
biscuity
malt
base
finishes
with
a
faint
grassy
hop
bitterness
that
lasts
a
little
decent
not
too
impressive
nicely
crafted
d
it
is
a
well
structured
brew
with
excellent
balance
and
mouth
feel
it
hits
the
abv
well
making
it
an
excellent
session
beer
very
nice
looking
pour
with
good
head
retention
and
dark
brown
color
sweet
and
woody
on
the
nose
smelling
of
brown
sugar
but
oddly
and
rare
this
beer
imo
tastes
nothing
like
it
smells
sweet
malty
brown
sugar
on
the
front
followed
by
spicey
high
hoppiness
udetectable
high
hoppiness
beer
smelled
to
me
more
like
an
english
brown
but
tastes
like
a
highly
hopped
american
strong
ale
says
its
an
altbier
but
i
think
ba
has
it
right
as
an
american
strong
as
ive
never
had
this
hoppy
of
an
alt
excellent
beer
nonetheless
a
very
unusual
brew
lots
going
on
would
enjoy
another
label
lists
this
as
a
stickealt
american
strong
ale
on
here
semantics
aside
this
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
so
smooth
for
its
7
2
abv
and
is
a
nice
malty
beer
with
tons
of
taste
a
great
breadybiscuity
aroma
and
just
fantastic
taste
this
is
a
great
beer
this
beer
has
a
nice
dark
fruit
aroma
intense
flavor
that
you
would
expect
from
a
double
the
malt
backbone
is
rich
and
could
use
more
of
a
bitter
counterbalance
the
dark
and
mapley
sweetness
is
a
bit
cloying
but
this
is
certainly
a
good
beer
to
try
liquid
fruit
cake
is
not
my
thing
at
the
moment
but
i
recognize
that
this
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
that
i
will
likely
appreciate
more
as
i
deviate
towards
the
maltier
styles
a
pumpkin
pie
treat
of
nutmeg
spice
and
sweet
bread
pudding
cinnamon

for

taste
smooth
malty
fullbodied
brew
that
disguises
alcohol
extremely
well
with
medicinal
flavor
that
slicks
the
tongue
nonexistent
carbonation
while
in
the
palate
creates
a
syrupy
characteristic
to
the
beer
a
well
balanced
thickness
like
molasses
or

taste
consists
of
a
sweet
mix
of
dark
malts
caramel
and
some
stale
fruits
amazing
balance
of

faint
alcohol
also
oh
so
pleasing
medium

full
bodied
with
very
little
carbonation
very
smooth
and
milky
one
of
my
highest
rated
for
sure

this
one
has

feel
and
is
a

in
the
process

one
to
sip
and
them
move
on
to
something

a

nuttiness
and
some

in
the
finish
smooth
chewy
mouthfeel
seems
to
suit
the
flavours
perfectly
and
i
cant
see
much
room
for
improvement
likewise
the
drinkability
is
just
short
of
exceptional
and
only
the
dangerously
hidden
alcohol
could
be
a
negative
factor
awesome

notes
it

the
best
you
can
had
the
pleasure
of
having
a
pint
yesterday
while
having
lunch
at
the
lt
brewery
on
the
drive
home
from
the
vt
beer
fest
served
in
a
pint
glass
brownish
red
hue
to
the
color
bordering
on
a
hint
of
orange
smell
didnt
hit
me
with
much
taste
was
good
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
though
for
a
strong
ale
the
flavor
seemed
a
bit
subdued
i
guess
i
am
used
to
beers
knocking
my
proverbial
socks
off
this
was
nice
beer
to
enjoy
with
some
food
as
its
a
bit
strong
7
so
some
food
in
the
stomach
was
good
before
driving
besides
the
ale
this
is
my
second
most
favorite
beer
that
lt
makes
pretty
good
drinkability
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
smooth
and
tasty
enough
to
enjoy
more
than
one
at
a
time
d
this
was
one
of
my
first
craft
beer
loves
and
i
like
to
revisit
from
time
to
time

makes
this
a
nonsession
beer
but
i
usually
find
myself
drinking
in
concession
goes
down
with
ease
and
that
7
can
sneak
up
on
you
d
nice
brew
very
easy
to
drink
especially
at
more
than
7
good
flavors
before
seeing
the
abv
i
though
that
i
could
drink
several
of
these
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of

hops
toffee
up
front
flavors
of
carmelized
malt
and
grapefruit
hops
are
well
balanced
highlighting
each
other
medium
body
and

this
is
a
mouth
cleansing
beer
with
a
dry
finish
and
has
a

bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
clean

crisp
and
well

very
drinkable
for

this
is
a
solid
alt
from
long
trail
although
alts
really
arent
something
i
drink
all
that
often
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
giving
this
another
try
if
i
had
a
couple
more
thanks
again
israel
drinkability
great
beer
easy
to
drink
great
taste
definitly
one
of
my
favorites
from
long
trail
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
alcohol
content
and
medium
body
but
1
or
two
is
definitly
managable
this
beer
is
great
for
anytime
of
the
year
not
too
dark
for
summertime
and
not
too
light
for
winter
id
buy
this
again
with
no
regrets
i
could
see
drinking
these
on
a
summer
night
in
front
of
a
campfire
or
in
front
of
my
tv
watching
the
pats
kick
butt
notes
not
for
session
the
abv
is
not
the
only
obstacleit
is
that
the
beer
is
medium
to
full
bodied
one
can
sip
or
drink
it
quickly
good
tasting
by
far
the
class
of
the
long
trail
lineup
this
beer
has
a
rich
amber
color
and
a
pretty
good

it
smells
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
there
is
a
hint
of
hops
with
a
citrus
tinge
in
there
somewhere
strangely
enough
its
smooth
mouthfeel
can
lead
you
to
keep
drinking
beware
the
strong
abv
is
hidden
well
in
this
intense
flavour
experience
bravo
long
trail
notes
this
is
certainly
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
year
round
and
very
drinkable
cheers
drinkability
is
very
good
nice
smooth
beer
that
leaves
a
nice
taste
on
your
tongue
pushing
you
to
take
another
sip
malt
in
the
forefront
with
a
bitter

beer
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
rest
of
this
sixpack
my
favorite
long
trail
brew
and
one
of
the
beers
that
started
me
on
a
neverending
odyssey
of
drinking
craft
beer
try
it
the
double
bag
pours
with
a
thin
head
and
has
a
reddish
golden
brown
color
it
is
sediment
free
and
has
a
strong
earthy
fruit
smell
tastes
of
chocolate
caramel
dates
and
a
hint
of
citrus
lighter
carbonation
makes
this
beer
an
easy
drinker
and
less
filling
the
higher
alcohol
content
is
hidden
by
its
deliciousness
my
absolute
favorite
long
trail
brew
the
double
bag
is
a
pretty
solid
alt
but
not
quite
equal
to
its
inspiration
uerige
sticke
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
d
refreshing
and
definately
seasonal
i
think
this
fits
the
fallwinter
seasons
better
than
right
now
d
over
all
its
ok
id
probably
never
choose
this
one
again
though
this
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
color
with
a
short
but
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
sits
atop
the
beer
most
of
the
time
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
smells
of
very
sweet
malts
some
viney
fruitiness
and
caramel
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
deep
but
sweet
malty
base
intertwined
with
some
viney
fruit
flavors
some
caramel
and
then
a
touch
of
hops
finishing
off
the
taste
of
this
beer
it
has
a
very
smooth
and
rich
mouthfeel
and
doesnt
feel
anywhere
near
its
alcoholic
content
which
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
altbier
well
worth
a
try
tastes
malty
with
a
definite
alcohol
backbone
kind
of
surprising
as
stronger
beers
mask
that
a
little
better
the
alcohol
content
in
this
one
is
definitely
not
a
secret
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
without
the
initial
sweetness
its
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
despite
the
alcohol
content
being
over
7
the
body
is
between
mid
and
full
a
nice
presence
with
a
under
carbonation
feel
that
enhances
the
malt
presence
overall
i
could
sticke
to
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
brew
doesnt
drink
like
you
would
think
a
7
2
abv
would
double
bag
is
a
solid
yet
subtle
beer
some
might
dismiss
it
because
theres
nothing
really
over
the
top
about
it
but
that
why
i
like
it
sometimes
you
need
a
beer
that
is
well
crafted
but
not
a
test
of
your
mouths
endurance
to
drink
this
is
a
balanced
beer
that
is
far
from
boring
and
is
very
drinkable
kudos
to
long
trail
just
watch
out
for
that
abv
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
long
trail
double
bag
has
been
on
my
radar
screen
for
some
time
now
im
pleased
to
say
that
it
has
lived
up
to
my
high
expectations
and
is
a
beer
that
i
would
gladly
purchase
on
a
semiregular
basis
if
it
was
available
locally
thanks
to

a

for
sending
me
a
bottle
out
of

this
is
a

beer
with
good
balance
and
full
flavor
12
oz
single
bottle
purchased
from
buy
rite
on
oak
tree
in
south
plainfield
pours
a
clean
clear
lucid
amber
and
copper
appearance
with
a
small
head
that
soon
receded
smell
was
a
nice
balance
between
malts
and
hops
which
was
also
strongly
evident
in
the
taste
which
was
also
crisp
clear
and
refreshing
noticeable
dichotomy
of
malts
and
hops
along
with
hints
of
caramel
and
slight
vanilla
which
included
a
slick
oily
taste
combining
elements
of
bread
and
butter
good
mouthfeel
that
was
rich
and
thick
with
a
nice
7
2
abv
wasnt
impressed
by
long
trails
hefeweizen
but
this
one
was
a
nice
sample
decent
mouthfeel
with
an
overall
quality
taste
led
to
a
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
worth
a
try
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
excepting
the
tiny
bit
of
astringency
i
would
drink
it
again
d
a
very
easy
drink
by
nature
woodsy
enjoyable
and
very
well
balanced
great
fall
beer
and
six
pack
worthy
d
really
drinkable
very
enjoyable
smooth
and
refreshing
and
at
7abv
a
surprisingly
refreshing
beer
had
it
with
some
salt
and
cracked
pepper
pan
fried
sirloin
strips
went
very
well
toasty
mellow
maltiness
picked
up
the
caramelized
meat
flavors
very
well
and
the
hop
bitterness
and
initial
carbonation
lifted
away
the
fattiness
will
be
interesting
when
i
compare
this
to
an
actual
german
alt
drinkability
is
definate
it
goes
down
easily
which
is
surprising
given
the
alcohol
content
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
and
decently
drinkable
but
not
much
going
on
overall
besides
the
malt
drinkability
very
high
this
beer
has
a
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
the
nioe
hop
flavor
that
along
with
the
smoothness
of
the
brew
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
good
carbonation
semidry
finish
medium
bodied
all
in
all
a
great
altbier
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
it
is
going
well
with
the
cold
air
and
snow
all
over
the
ground
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
by
a
long
shot
good
job
at
hiding
the
alcohol
volume
as
well
very
sessionable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
buttery
leaves
a
little
film
gives
a
smooth
balance
to
the
tangy
flavor
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
long
trail
brews
tangy
and
smooth
bottled
17sep07
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
very
clear
pale
colored
with
no
head
smells
of
straw
bananas
and
sweet
toasted
malt
light
in
the
mouth
with
some
hops
at
the
tail
end
seems
german
in
style
but
reminds
me
of
fosters
special
bitter
that
is
not
a
good
thing
i
was
a
bit
dissapointed
from
the
label
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
double
milk
stout
neh
i
could
easily
live
without
this
beer
d
drinker
please
beware
this
is
a
good
beer
that
will
creep
up
on
you
a
little
too
quickly
served
up
a
clear
almostbrown
amber
with
a
creamy
1finger
beige
head
signs
of
carbonation
persisted
and
left
nice
rings
and
a
little
lacing
as
the
beer
vanished
spicy
noble
hops
aroma
is
balanced
off
with
rich
malt
slightly
like
toasty
bread
rich
and
clean
in
smell
the
taste
is
equally
clean
the
light
hoppy
flavor
hits
the
tongue
first
quickly
followed
by
midlow
bittering
bitter
flavor
could
have
been
a
bit
stronger
the
sweet
toasty
malt
fills
the
mouth
and
sticks
through
a
dry
aftertaste
midfull
mouth
feel
and
a
bit
light
on
the
carbonation
which
may
have
helped
add
to
the
bitter
taste
very
nice
taste
clean
smooth
and
subtly
rich
bittering
or
carbonation
could
have
been
a
bit
increased
flavors
get
much
richer
as
it
is
allowed
to
warm
good
offering
and
highly
drinkable
i
think
that
this
is
long
trails
best
beer
i
will
purchase
it
again
and
again
i
was
a
bit
leary
of
trying
an
american
alt
but
this
one
pours
a
med
copper
color
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissapates
quickly
leaving
a
minimal
amount
of
lacing
a
malty
slightly
vinous
aroma
w
a
faint
hoppy
butterishlike
undertone
a
crisp
little
hop
bite
at
first
followed
by
a
rich
malty
butterscotch
flavor
some
hop
flavors
as
well
a
dry
lightmed
bodied
brew
w
a
med
amount
of
carbonation
sticks
around
long
enough
to
taste
it
dry
enough
to
make
you
want
more
a
very
drinkable
beer
esp
for
the
7
2
abv
im
on
my
3rd
now
this
beer
had
that
dark
wood
appearance
with
a
kicking
smell
the
aroma
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
medicine
maybe
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
3
in
a
night
because
of
its
potency
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
draft
some
time
overall
its
a
good
brew
and
i
agree
with
the
guy
that
says
too
many
of
these
will
put
you
in
the
bag
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
that
left
some
spot
lacing
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
and
some
nice
floral
hops
the
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
slightly
buttery
with
a
metallic
twang
this
is
followed
by
a
nice
mellow
floralgrassy
hop
presence
the
malt
and
hops
balance
very
well
in
the
brew
the
alcohol
is
subtle
you
know
that
it
is
there
but
you
cant
really
tastefeel
it
the
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
crisp
and
well
balanced
a
good
malty
brew
with
a
nice
complimenting
hop
balance
and
enough
of
a
alcohol
presence
to
be
able
to
put
you
in
the
bag
if
you
had
a
few
of
these
nice
looking
reddish
browh
with
12
tan
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves
continuous
to
spotty
lace
very
active
bubbling
in
the
body
smelss
big
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
initial
flavor
is
excellent
big
malt
with
light
bread
and
a
very
smooth
transition
to
nicely
balanced
malt
and
bitter
hop
aftertaste
medium
to
full
bodied
with
slightly
dry
texture
and
lively9
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
wish
were
more
widely
available
it
has
a
very
nicely
balanced
flavor
that
is
just
a
little
sweet
this
is
a
big
beer
that
feels
a
lot
more
traditional
than
some
of
americas
other
big
beers
it
is
not
overwhelming
in
any
way
no
need
for
making
faces
due
to
overabundant
hops
very
pleasant
and
smooth
now
this
is
what
i
call
a
session
beer
yeah
i
know
way
too
strong
but
thats
how
i
like
em
looks
good
decent
but
not
huge
head
although
it
recedes
pretty
quickly
smell
is
sweet
malt
nothing
special
really
its
the
taste
that
makes
this
brew
smooth
fullbodied
wellbalanced
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
too
finely
carbonated
and
just
chewy
enough
loses
some
of
that
as
i
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
lose
the
carbonation
but
up
to
that
point
its
a
really
smooth
brew
drinkability
pretty
enjoyable
despite
somewhat
unpleasant
initial
hop
presence
good
but
not
exceptional

last
pretty
matly
but
not
overly
sweet
and
very
crisp
definantly
can
notice
the
hops
but
not
in
a
dominant
way
kind
of
a
chewy
mouthfeel
but
overall
the
body
is
pretty
good
very
drinkable
good
beer
all
around
overall
double
bag
is
a
really
good
brew
its
a
highly
drinkable
smooth
tasting
strong
beer
i
definitely
recommend
it
d
very
drinkable
given
the
abv
enjoyed
it
with
a
burger
and
could
have
enjoyed
a
few
more
this
is
a
delicious
beer
from
what
i
understand
alts
are
german
style
beers
fermented
with
ale
yeast
but
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
a
lager
well
both
characteristics
come
out
in
this
brew
with
nice
clean
and
refreshing
lager
traits
balanced
and
complemented
by
fruity
esters
and
malt
sweetness
and
body
fruits
berries
cranberries
blackberries
and
some
cherries
and
caramel
sugar
in
the
nose
it
is
a
nice
clear
medium
brown
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
thin
white
bubbly
head
tastes
malty
and
sweet
but
with
enough
bitterness
to
satisfy
the
hopheads
a
very
balanced
presentation
in
all
both
malt
and
hops
are
fully
enjoyed
in
this
brew
smooth
mouthfeel
and
reasonable
carbonation
i
cant
really
remember
a
beer
in
which
the
alcohol
is
so
disguised
itll
make
you
want
to
down
a
few
so
watch
out
as
a
side
note
i
drank
one
of
these
one
night
after
drinking
a
rather
hoppy
amber
ale
and
the
complexity
of
the
beer
jumped
out
much
further
it
reminded
me
of
a
tripel
mixed
with
a
quad
the
sweetness
and
richness
of
the
malts
really
came
through
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
makes
this
a
dangerously
drinkable
brew
by
far
my
favorite
long
trail
brew
i
will
definetly
be
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
this
next
time
i
visit
the
liquor
store
this
is
one
tasty
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
have
it
the
abv
is
hidden
and
the
beer
is
sweetthis
may
be
the
sweetest
i
like
my
beer
to
be
without
a
generous
amount
of
hop
balance
in
there
go
long
trail
rock
on
with
your
bad
self
very
enjoyable
i
must
say
had
i
purchased
more
than
one
bottle
i
could
sticke
with
this
for
one
or
two
more
drinkability
flavorful
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
something
with
alcohol
this
evident
md
i
imagine
this
could
be
quite
sessionable
and
also
a
beer
to
get
people
who
dont
normally
drink
craft
beer
trying
somethings
medium
bodied
slightly
chewy
not
too
bad
might
pick
up
one
or
two
more
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
little
head
but
whats
their
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
malts
with
some
yeast
notes
the
taste
is
also
sweet
with
a
fruit
and
hop
bite
at
the
end
not
super
drinkable
a
tad
to
sweet
for
my
taste
without
the
hop
to
balance
it
a
decent
beer
from
long
trail
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
juicy
fruit
and
cereal
finish
lowmoderate
carbonation
makes
for
a
more
dense
finish
that
is
not
dry
pleasant
on
the
palate
throughout
well
balanced
and
very
complex
high
marks
in
all
categories
i
would
certainly
suggest
it
definitely
a
german
beer
the
malt
is
very
sweet
w
a
very
subtle
fruitiness
to
it
a
deep
amber
w
a
thick
but
quickly
faded
head
the
nose
is
somewhat
alcoholic
but
that
doesnt
carry
over
to
the
taste
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
and
gives
it
a
slight
tingle
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
i
cant
describe
what
makes
this
beer
so
reminiscent
of
german
beers
but
the
flavor
is
unique
and
tastes
very
clean
although
the
malt
is
very
sweet
there
is
also
a
nice
complement
of
roasted
malt
and
light
hops
which
keep
it
from
being
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
clean
while
the
drinkability
is
crazy
although
it
can
get
heavy
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
im
finishing
the
last
few
sips
right
now
and
the
beer
is
very
close
to
room
temperature
but
still
tastes
great
although
this
beer
claims
to
be
a
secret
brew
it
still
remains
very
close
to
german
style
definitely
my
favorite
offering

i
think
this
is
actually
an

o
overall
i
would
say
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
if
i
was
introducing
one
of
my
40

or

friends
to
something
else
this
would
be
a

like

this
is

on

independently

beer
the

if
i
was
to

i
would
imagine
this
was
the
beer
they
brewed
to
introduce
the
masses
to
their
line
as
its
a
great
spot
on
beer
for
just
that

completely
resonated

will

be
pouring
this

really
stands

the

the

with
just
the

im
an

fan
been
drinking
it
for
about
12
years
now
it
always
seemed
to
have
this
different
taste
which
i
have
come
to
love
in
that
old
friend
kind
of
way
this
is
always
my
go
to
as
far
as
a
simple
everyday
beer
goes
seems
to
pair
up

just
about
everything

its

like
and
a
great
starting
point
into
more
experimental
and
craftier
beers
as
i
noted
above
its
also
handy
because
it
pairs
with
almost
any
meal
i
had
one
with
some
bbq
seitan
baked
beans
and
broccoli
and
it
really
tied
the
meal
together
thumbs
up
o
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
and
it
still
holds
up
as
an
easy
drinking
yet
flavorful
session
ale
nothing
special
but
its
different
from
your
average
amber
ale
or
lager
o
i
guess
its
ok
for
the
style
id
much
rather
have
double
bag
though
pours
a
nice
oftburnt
orange
color
with
a
thin
but
full
head
scents
of
pears
apricots
and
caramel
rush
to
the
nose
malty
musty
grainy
on
the
first
sip
a
touch
of
tangy

caramel
flows
throughout
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
medium
washes
down
clean
with
a
slight
twinge
of
hops
very
refreshing
and
an
excellent
session
beer
easy
drinking
almost
like
a
lighter
version
of
an

crisp
and

very
well
crafted
yeah
this
was
good
id
get
a
sixer
long

ale
is
an
ok
american

good
starter
craft
good
reliable
id
take
a
sams
over
it
not
great
for
a
flagship
good
with
burgers
and
burlington
fare
not
a
huge
amber
guy
but
i
love
me
a
proper
altbier
and
this
is
mighty
proper
a
beer
ive
fallen
back
to
time
and
time
again
and
one
of
my
favorite
sessions
when
its
ice
ice
ice
cold
it
has
a
dim
scent
of
american
and
german
malts
red
and
pilsener
with
a
crisp
lager
yeast
right
one
cue
although
this
is
an
ale
it
has
that
snappy
cleanness
to
it
uncommon
for
the
style
but
perfect
in
this
brew
love
the
barely
there
hop
balance
in
the
finish
almost
english
in
that
regard
with
the
grains
being
the
dominant
players
touch
of
sweetness
touch
of
bittersweet
burnt
toffee
touch
of
bitter
hops
touch
of
fruity
punch
outstanding
feel
enough
body
to
be
a
beer
drinkers
beer
but
light
enough
and
brightly
enough
carbonated
to
be
refreshing
at
the
same
time
if
all
ambers
from
the
united
states
were
like
this
one
i
might
set
my
ipa
down
and
drink
more
of
them
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
when
like
i
said
it
is
freezing
cold
warmer
not
so
much
a
staple
in
my
beer
drinking
for
the
last
ten
years
or
so
o
this
is
an
ale
that
is
cold
fermented
lagered
and
it
drinks
like
it
this
is
about
as
perfectly
as
i
can
sum
up
a
standard
basic
ale
that
isnt
bad
and
is
quite
drinkable
but
is
otherwise
unremarkable
it
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
in
any
way
other
than
the
slightly
out
of
place
banana
aroma
and
flavor
i
absolutely
wouldnt
mind
having
one
or
two
of
these
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
or
purchase
it
over
a
good
lager
or
a
better
ale
overall
looks
and
feels
very
clean
but
the
smell
and
flavor
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
get
their
double
bag
instead
if
you
have
to
choose
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
not
gross
but
not
very
good
o
long
trails
flagship
ale
is
admittedly
only
slightly
above
average
that
said
as
far
as
flagship
ales
for
breweries
like
long
trail
go
long
trail
ale
is
ahead
of
the
pack
if
only
in
that
it
is
unique
rather
than
being
a
simple
apa
or
ipa
long
trail
opted
for
a
lesserknown
german
altbier
and
in
long
trail
ale
they
have
accomplished
what
they
presumably
intendedtaking
over
the
vermont
beer
market
that
is
i
would
never
turn
down
a
long
trail
ale
even
if
i
have
been
drinking
less
and
less
of
it
as
time
progresses
o
good
to
try
but
not
for
a
steady
diet
overall
i
guess
this
is
long
trails
flagship
ale
and
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
traditional
altbier
style
but
this
was
not
particularly
enjoyable
even
though
it
lacks
in
the
flavor
dept
this
beer
is
so
enjoyable
and
so
easy
to
drink
i
have
give
it
an
overall
of
4
5
o
very
drinkable
especially
at
the
subfive
abv
this
is
a
good
beer
very
sessionable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
wish
the
beer
tasted
better
i
like
everything
about
it
but
the
flavor
its
one
very
basic
bitter
note
i
have
to
give
this
a
sub
par
rating
considering
copper
colored
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipated
a
nice
strong
malty
smell
to
it
the
sweet
malt
is
the
first
flavor
then
mild
bitter
grapefruit
and
a
solid
bitter
ending
a
kind
of
up
and
down
taste
profile
but
it
works
well
together
medium
body
moderate
carbonation

overall
o
a

nicely

a

breadiness
that
offers
up

taste

with

edge
dry

hops
and
toasted
multigrain
bread
crust
feel
is

in

a

and

with
an

to
go
with
just
about
any
food
you
may
throw
at
it
a
solid
brew
o
this
is
a
very
underappreciated
beer
its
actually
quite
impressive
what
long
trail
has
been
able
to
accomplish
with
it
theyve
made
a
relatively
obscure
beer
style
into
their
flagship
offering
and
turned
it
into
the
best
selling
beer
in
vermont
flavorful
and
fullbodied
but
simple
approachable
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
solid
stuff
and
a
good
quaff
the
crack
revealed
yet
another
brimful
craft
can
i
subsequently
employed
an

glug

in

good
retention
color
was
a
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
both
sweet
and
spicy
like
malt
coupled
with
pepper
interesting
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
bittersweet
a
pleasant
marriage
of
malt
and
hops
some
great
lacing
began
to
appear
as
i
drank
through
it
finish
was
tending
towards
bitter
so
i
am
going
to
call
it
dry
or
semidry
either
way
it
should
give
you
some
idea
of
what
to
expect
not
bad
and
i
am
curious
as
to
why
they
are
characterizing
it
as
an
amber
on
the
can
the
rest
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
ok
if
you
drink
it
fast
but
if
you
really
taste
it
it
isnt
so
good
decent
session
beer
on
a
warm
afternoon
still
a
real
solid
ale
but
certainly
not
up
to
the
high
standars
of
the
long
trail
double
bag
this
has
a
very
clean
yeast
flavor
which
is
good
with
a
nice
body
and
mild
grainy
malt
which
has
a
toasted
yet
not
quite
caramel
flavor
with
some
hops
adding
balance
the
only
thing
lacking
is
a
bit
more
malt
could
have
helped
as
it
seems
to
be
light
for
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
for
what
it
is
a
relatively
mild
alt
it
is
refreshing
and
is
not
lacking
in
flavor
yet
it
does
leave
you
wanting
more
in
the
taste
and
aroma
overall
a
nice
beer
with
a
distracting
flaw
ive
held
this
longer
than
i
shouldve
picked
it
up
on
a
trip
back
east
but
that
didnt
seem
to
hurt
much
nothing
really
to
bring
me
back
but
glad
i
tried
it
an
average
ale
that
comes
with
no
surprises
a
real
good
altbier
theres
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
such
a
low
alcohol
beer
o
an
average
to
below
average
ale
i
was
slightly
put
off
by
the
astringency
but
managed
to
keep
with
this
one
not
a
drain
pour
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
6
pack
o
i
remember
this
being
better
when
i
drank
it
more
often
towards
the
beginning
of
college
slightly
better
than
average
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
nor
would
i
pay
for
this
beer
if
most
others
in
its
price
range
were
available
o
overall
its
a
nice
sessionable
flavorful
refreshing
beer
light
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
not
bad
this
one
was
a
left
over
from
a
gathering
with
a
handful
of
friends
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
to
exciting
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
copper
color
with
a
decent
sized
fluffy
white
head
that
displays
moderate
retention
and
lace
smells
of
sweet
bready
malt
toffee
hints
of
apricot
and
tangerine
and
a
light
herbal
earthy
hop
aroma
taste
is
sweet
malts
up
front
immediately
followed
by
an
earthy
hop
bite
sweet
toffee
and
a
hint
of

contrasted
with
apricot
spice
pepper
and
a
light
fruitiness
medium
body
with
a
dry
finish
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
used
to
be
the
beer
i
drank
when
i
went
skiing
15
years
ago
but
i
havent
had
it
in
years
sometimes
when
you
try
to
go
back
it
only
serves
to
disappoint
decent
enough
drinker
but
really
nothing
special
o
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
put
back
a
few
of
these
easily
seems
like
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
off
or
the
style
but
otherwise
a
nice
simple
tasty
brew
o
slightly
above
average
would
recommend
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
overall
approachable
very
smooth
easydrinking
ale
long
trail
has
seemed
to
hone
in
on
nice
interpretations
of
the
altbier
style
perfect
for
friday
night
beer
and
pizza
oan
average
boring
beer
long
trail
has
better
offering
but
still
nothing
much
to
say
about
this
beer
12oz

somewhat

a

near

very
drinkable
ive
had
this
beer
at
least
100
times
and
never
reviewed
it
until
now
obviously
its
a
pretty
decent
choice
of
beer
when
your
at
a
place
with
a
limited
tap
selection
overall
a
fine
beer
needs
a
cigarette
love
the
initial
taste
color
is
pure
a
bit
of
a
soda
pop
aeration
after
3
minutes
it
smells
better
so
not
too
bad
but
the
pallet
ends
up
gritty
texture
is
bit
foamy
makes
pretzels
very
dry
possible
bulk
quantity
for
unexpected
guests
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
its
a
great
session
brew
or
one
to
have
after
a
day
in
the
mountains
clear
copper
in
color
topped
off
by
a
short
head
of
foam
the
smell
is
tangy
and
sort
of
fruity
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
finishes
dry
the
body
of
this
beer
is
medium
and
works
well
with
the
taste
carbonated
just
right
overall
this
is
a
respectable
brew
definitely
cant
go
wrong
with
it
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
to
the
mouth
leaves
nicely
letting
you
to
want
more
the
taste
is
exceptional
for
this
type
of
beer
overall
we
are
impressed
this
is
a
good
american
ale
enjoy
o
an
enjoyable
brew
not
outstanding
in
any
aspect
but
it
drinks
nicely
and
i
do
love
long
trail
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
hazy
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
thin
eighth
of
an
inch
offwhite
foamy
head
aromas
of
berry
fruit
sweetness
with
a
somewhat
rich
toffeelike
background
flavors
are
rich
and
sweet
with
the
toffee
character
once
again
present
and
a
fruit
blend
not
unlike
a
piece
of
fruitcake
with
some
nuttiness
and
sugary
highlights
very
light
in
mouth
with
a
slick
and
substantial
feel
to
it
the
aftertaste
is
much
like
fruitcake
as
well
a
bit
of
a
letdown
the
aftertaste
is
lighter
than
the
initial
palate
and
the
fruit
characters
and
toffeelike
body
all
get
a
tad
bit
watered
down
the
finish
is
light
and
crisp
without
much
of
a
linger
very
easy
brew
to
drink
and
not
bad
around
a
campfire
o
easy
drinker
good
for
a
couple
comes
across
as
run
of
the
mill
nonoffensive
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
of
charactor
from
an
altbier
o
very
drinkable
but
not
quite
as
good
at
the
otter
creek
copper
ale
overall
really
not
bad
though
not
terribly
thrilling
i
can
see
bringing
a
case
of
this
to
a
party
not
my
favorite
alt
but
still
nice
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
a
very
tasty
and
highly
quaffable
ale
overall
well
balanced
would
be
a
good
beer
to
offer
a
friend
who
is
not
into
the
craft
brews
we
tend
like
very
good
an
easy
drinker
a
bit
on
the
subtle
side
but
definately
not
macrolike
a
good
crossover
beer
just
noticed
the
beer
is
listed
as
an
altbier
which
i
doubt
i
wouldve
guessed
o
balanced
a
maltforward
beer
that
doesnt
get
clumsy
though
a
little
simple
in
places
there
is
plenty
to
enjoy
and
execution
counts
for
a
lot
good
stuff
d
this
is
a
great
eastcoast
standby
i
dont
appreciate
the
last
several
b
and
c
grades
some
of
the
other
members
have
given
long
trail
ale
the
previous
beer
drinkers
claim
that
this
beer
appears
to
be
toomacro
for
cryin
out
loud
this
is
one
1st
beers
of
the
micro
revolution
mid
80s
to
early
90s
paved
the
way
for
what
everyone
tastes
now
was
a
fan
in
the
back
in
the
day
and
remain
one
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
beer
that
i
could
definitely
session
it
comes
across
as
more
of
an
esb
or
a
english
pale
ale
than
a
altbier
however
for
the
price
its
worth
a
try
o
its
a
good
beer
glad
i
tried
it
but
nothing
for
me
to
seek
out
in
the
future
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
to
remember
o
when
the
hell
did
long
trail
get
this
good
after
not
having
one
for
years
i
had
my
first
lta
at
a
relatives
house
last
month
and
was
pretty
amazed
way
better
than
i
remembered
it
and
i
had
to
go
out
and
buy
some
more
to
see
if
it
was
a
fluke
it
aint
a
great
session
beer
o
pretty
good
i
havent
had
many
altbiers
its
been
awhile
since
the
old
days
of
stickenjab
and
even
southamptons
altbier
which
i
recall
liking
a
lot
i
havent
had
in
awhile
nonoffensive
and
drinkable
i
cant
complain
about
this
beer
but
it
does
nothing
to
impress
either
overall
i
find
this
a
great
ale
and
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
quality
and
flavor
overall
one
of
long
trails
stand
out
brew
in
a
bottle
clean
flavors
make
this
very
drinkable
style
is
somewhere
between
an
esb
and
alt
but
very
tasty
o
decent
altbier
with
a
nice
caramel
balance
character
havent
had
too
many
altbier
brews
but
this
was
pretty
good
and
easily
drinkable
this
is
a
very
simple
beer
which
goes
well
at
just
about
any
occasion
perfect
midwinter
and
midsummer
bottom
line
this
beer
is
a
bitter
version
of
the
double
bag
with
a
less
abv
i
also
found
this
beer
to
be
slightly
more
complex
than
double
bag
probably
due
to
the
sweetness
not
getting
in
the
way
the
drink
ability
of
this
beer
is
also
better
because
of
this
its
another
respectable
offering
from
long
trail
definitely
worthy
of
trying
d
pretty
enjoyable
and
definitely
sessionable
well
rounded
and
tasty
ill
have
to
remember
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
one
copper
brown
color
no
head
or
lace
at
first
taste
i
thought
this
beer
had
some
very
lagerish
qualities
there
was
not
much
complexity
however
it
was
smooth
with
a
slight
hop
flavor
the
hoppiness
came
out
more
and
more
with
each
sip
and
overall
this
beer
evolved
into
something
i
could
drink
again
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
that
a
summer
beer
couldnt
beat
the
price
either
o
great
session
ale
perfect
balance
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
a
bit
light
and
unremarkable
it
does
not
feel
watery
or
empty
it
is
felt
like
it
needed
a
bit
more
of
a
kick
would
like
to
do
this
side
by
side
with
shiners
old
time
alt
which
i
enjoyed
o
nothing
especially
outstanding
it
went
down
a
little
too
easily
to
be
taken
seriously
on
my
part
its
not
terrible
just
a
little
too
basic
for
my
taste
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
cap
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
the
aroma
is
of
light
caramel
almonds
and
some
earthy
hops
not
overwhelming
nor
overly
pleasing
on
the
palate
this
is
a
nice
little
drinker
earthy
notes
caramel
with
some
almonds
in
the
mix
very
similar
to
the
nose
a
smooth
easy
drinker
with
a
clean
dry
finish
a
touch
of
bitterness
just
to
let
you
know
its
there
lingers
on
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
extremely
easy
beer
to
put
back
crisp
and
smooth
and
a
decent
option
in
a
pinch
average
not
a
must
have
pine
like
bite
and
dry
finish
left
you
thirsty
at
the
end
of
it
some
nice
malts
mixed
in
as
well
as
a
decent
amount
of
sugar
super
light
and
crisp
absolutly
perfect
for
a
summer
day
really
impressed
with
the
taste
here
really
good
and
quite
suprised
actually
this
one
really
had
quite
a
smooth
feel
to
it
lots
of
carbonation
rippled
through
nicely
and
a
somewhat
slick
but
not
that
bad
of
a
feeling
it
was
just
light
enough
to
really
be
a
good
drinker
mo
super
clean
and
crisp
the
carbonation
seems
spot
on
which
i
am
pleased
with
after
seeing
how
fizzy
it
looked
when
i
first
poured
it
all
in
all
its
nothing
crazy
nothing
special
but
this
beer
is
one
that
i
could
bring
over
a
friends
house
and
know
that
everyone
would
like
not
to
mention
more
than
adjunct
lags
just
personal
preference
but
i
wish
i
had
a
little
more
hop
to
it
oas
may
have
said
pretty
good
from
start
to
finish
very
drinkable
an
interesting
alt
as
for
the
style
goes
as
far
as
a
beer
goes
its
not
very
complex
and
its
simplicity
is
nice
for
drinkability
but
otherwise
makes
me
a
little
bored
with
it
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
but
if
you
want
something
to
take
hiking
or
fishing
this
one
would
be
pretty
nice
i
think
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
making
this
rather
refreshing
overall
for
a
beer
ive
had
a
thousand
times
before
i
still
enjoy
it
just
as
much
as
i
did
the
first
time
nothing
to
exciting
going
on
but
refreshing
and
enjoyable
with
a
low
abv
too
this
beer
is
a
good
summer
session
not
much
going
on
but
easy
to
drink
serving
type
on
tap
at
the
wobbly
barn
in
vt
d
i
could
keep
drinking
this
beer
all
night
long
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
quite
sessionable
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
though
it
was
fairly
light
i
expected
something
with
a
much
lighter
flavor
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
from
notes
tasted

2010

easy

familiar
with
the
style
so
its
difficult
for
me
to
make
a

evaluation
that
being
said
i
found
the
brew
to
be
simple
wellbalanced
and
easy
drinking
not
something
i
would
seek
out
on
its
own
but
a
nice
addition
to

its
more
interesting
than
i
expected
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable

a
good

is
high
due
to
the
refreshing
nature
lighter
mouthfeel
and
desirable
aftertaste
a
good
beer
for
having
a
few
but
nothing
profound
an
easy
session
beer
but
nothing
very
special
here
i
got
this
in
the
survival
long
trial
variety
pack
otherwise
i
prolly
wont
seek
this
out
again
d
although
nothing
thats
going
to
blow
your
socks
off
its
quite
drinkable
it
was
pretty
easy
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
watching
football
a
nice
crispy
beer
d
not
overly
complex
but
a
decent
beer
that
could
easily
be
sessioned
if
you
enjoy
a
beer
with
more
malt
flavor
and
just
a
taste
of
bitter
hops
drink
well
my
friends
a
good
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
long
trail
is
a
beer
that
you
dont
go
out
of
the
way
for
but
if
you
see
it
on
tap
it
is
nice
go
to
beer
you
wont
go
wrong
with
this
drinkability
i
would
likely
limit
myself
to
2
or
3
by
that
point
i
would
be
ready
for
a
new
taste
drinkability
meh
its
ok
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
id
pick
it
up
again
a
rich
mostly
clear
copper
brew
with
a
standard
quarter
to
half
inch
head
from
a
tap
pour
light

thick

of

and

rind
carry
through
to
the
taste
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitter
kumquat
mouthfeel
is
dry
with
adequate
sharp
carbonation
crisp
and
tasty
a
worthy
and
enjoyable
brew
drinkability
a
very
light
beer
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
for
sure
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
only
a
slight
bitter
mouth
feel
at
the
end
d
a
fine
nondescript
ale
indeed
i
would
definitely
have
a
couple
of
these
d
not
a
great
beer
but
not
a
terrible
beer
either
has
some
very
pleasing
qualities
that
can
be
accessible
for
a
newcomer
to
craft
beer
nothing
to
sneeze
at
im
looking
forward
to
trying
some
other
long
trail
beers
served
in
a
pint
at
joe
sent
me
in
waltham
reddish
tinged
golden
with
a
bit
of
a
head
with
some
resultant
lace
malty
aroma
with
no
clue
as
to
the
hopping
balance
maybe
leaning
toward
the
sweetmalty
side
some
of
the
hops
come
out
in
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
pours
transparent
reddishorange
hue
with
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
weak
aroma
of
sweets
light
syrup
spices
malt
ginger
bread
spices
ginger
bread
cinnamon
burnt
malt
flavors
light
hops
but
they
stay
vague
light
slight
spritzy
body
that
is
very
drinkable
for
an
afternoon
brew
d
not
something
i
would
personally
look
for
again
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
d
its
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
its
pretty
easy
to
sit
down
and
have
a
couple
this
was
my
first
taste
of
long
trail
and
i
must
say
i
was
a
little
disappointed
perhaps
i
expected
too
much
i
cant
really
see
myself
buying
this
again
though
i
still
would
like
to
try
more
from
this
company
ranks
a
pretty
average
beer
i
like
the
taste
pretty
unique
in
my
opinion
for
a
lager
a
good
base
beer
for
long
trail
to
work
off
of
but
nothing
spectacular
that
would
keep
me
buying
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
still
a
solid
brew
a
real
good
new
england
beer
good
taste
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
which
is
better
on
draft
if
you
can
find
it
good
from
the
bottle
but
not
as
good
as
on
draft
taste
is
really
swee
hoppy
and
rich
honestly
its
a
great
beer
vert
rich
mouthfeel
with
a
real
strong
wheaty
and
malt
flavor
great
beer
now
ill
lay
feelings
and
probably
biases
to
bear
as
a
native
vermonter
i
love
the
long
trail
ale
walk
into
any
bar
in
vt
and
chances
are
youll
find
this
on
tap
or
in
the
cooler
at
the
local
store
but
despite
its
saturation
in
the
vermont
market
its
a
damn
good
beer
to
boot
theres
nothing
in
your
face
about
it
but
the
balance
and
drinkability
is
spot
on
perfect
and
its
low
abv
means
you
can
enjoy
several
without
too
much
worry
of
alcohols
less
desirable
sideeffects
there
is
no
occasion
season
time
event
that
i
can
think
of
that
long
trail
ale
wouldnt
be
suitable
for
all
in
all
if
youre
into
craft
beer
avoid
this
brew
nothing
special
at
all
this
would
be
good
for
mainstream
beer
lovers
if
you
like
brews
like
bud
coors
and
michelob
then
this
is
for
you
otherwise
avoid
d
the
balance
on
this
beer
is
like
one
perfect
up
and
down
of
a
seesaw
with
the
malts
on
one
side
and
the
hops
on
the
other
i
swear
theres
something
about
vermont
water
that
makes
beers
from
there
seem
cleaner
and
fresher
tasting
a
wonderful
session
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
all
day
or
night
long
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
and
recommend
it
for
anybody
that
likes
a
rich
flavorful
and
rather
light
drinking

brew
but
i
wouldnt
want
a
whole

them
madjr80nov

but
overall
i
found
it
to
smell
a
little
macro
and
to
be
a
little
bit
soapy
i
made
sure
that
it
wasnt
because
of
the
glass
the
taste
goes
down
very
easily
and
thats
a
good
thing
in
the
land
of
heavy
amber
ales
the
ale
yeast
is
adding
a
distinctive
fruitiness
somewhat
overcarbonated
but
not
smooth
and
not
inyourface
well
balanced
malt
vs
hops
with
a
dry
graininess
and
light
toast
neither
light
nor
heavy
good
retention
and
lacing
this
is
a
light
bodied
lale
eaning
towards
medium
on
the
heartiness
continuum
the
smell
is
indistinct
and
inoffensive
hardly
an
enticing
descriptor
the
taste
is

a

and
a

it

this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
refreshing
smooth

clean

color
with

leaves
a

in

not

malty
and
just
the
right
balance
of
hops
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
solidly
brewed
beer
this
is
one
brew
that
long
trail
really
has
done
well
with
it
is
enjoyable
year
round
and
reminds
me
of
some
good
times
during
college
in
vt
this
a
great
brew
and
a
good
choice
to
use
if
you
are
introducing
new
people
to
the

to
a

some

a

with

session
beer
and
since
it
can
usually
be

at

for
a
12
pack
one
of
my
favorites
a
dark
amber
colored
brew
with
lagerlike
smooth
malt
and
hop
aromas
nothing
distinct
here
but
fresh
and
apetizing
taste
is
similar
with
a
nice
hop
bite
and
smooth
robust
malt
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
session
beer
great
for
apres
ski
at
jay
peak
vt
dont
know
that
this
tastes
like
an
alt
beer
but
drink
it
anyway
this
is
one
of
longs
trails
finest
it
has
a
nice
color
and
a
nice
hops
flavor
and
aroma
it
has
just
enough
bite
to
be
interesting
but
not
to
much
to
scare
away
some
people
it
is
a
great
beer
to
convert
people
who
hate
a
good
hoppy
beer
the
aroma
is
great
somewhat
fruity
but
not
to
much
a
good
beer
all
around
long
trail
ale
was
entirely
unremarkable
it
was
pulled
a
clear
golden
brown
it
carried
no
head
in
fact
a
scant
film
only
vaguely
hinted
that
the
beer
might
conceive
of
such
a
thing
the
flavor
was
generic
yeast
and
barley
with
a
little
hopping
i
cant
talk
about
balance
as
there
was
no
real
flavor
interaction
the
beer
was
basic
perhaps
a
bit
thin
and
watery
it
neither
neither
succeeded
nor
failed
its
drinkable
but
only
something
id
select
if
it
were
a
lone
micro
standout
in
a
bar
of
macros
char
it
pours
to
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
has
hardly
any
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
pleasant
with
a
bit
of
a
floral
bouquet
the
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
and
very
crisp
pretty
nice
tasting
beer
over
all
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
one
that
i
would
never
turn
down
if
offered
its
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
that
is
just
one
persons
feelings
thanks
to
rabidawg
for
the
sampling
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
crystal
and
pale
malts
along
side
the
taste
is
decent
there
is
a
good
balance
here
between
hops
and
malts
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
clean
tasting
the
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
a
light
bodied
ale
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
microale
from
vermont
a
good
sessions
ale
with
a
fellow
ba
one
of
my
standard
favorites
when
i
can
get
it
tapfresh
up
in
vt
a
good
social
brew
and
a
good
one
to
begin
sessions
with
this
is
an
altbierstyled
brew
similar
to
both
the
famous
düsseldorf
altstadt
and
northern
german
varieties
not
quite
the
intensity
of
the
citys
yet
more
bitter
than
most
northern
styles
i
would
not
label
this
beer
simply
a
moderately
bitter
brown
ale
by
the
german
standard
but
might
be
so
inclined
by
american
ones
not
sure
how
much
munich
malt
is
involved
or
whether
they
laydown
the
ale
for
a
period
of
maturity
but
when
i
drink
this
i
do
not
necessarily
relate
it
in
my
head
to
an
altbier
just
greattasting
enjoyment
long
trails
namesake
ale
was
my
favorite
beer
from
all
the
thanksgiving
weekend
tastings
i
believe
it
to
be
a
great
american
tribute
to
german
altbiers
it
pours
a
deep
amberbrown
with
a
touch
of
clouding
in
the
glass
this
ales
white
head
doesnt
last
long
over
your
pint
it
smells
of
bittersweet
toffee
andor
caramel
i
couldnt
really
pin
it
down
lt
ale
starts
crisp
flavorful
and
smooth
it
is
full
bodied
with
dominant
wheat
and
oat
flavors
there
are
several
suggestions
of
both
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
present
in
each
mouthful
it
finishes
cool
crisp
clean
and
most
pleasantly
were
i
ever
in
new
england
again
id
definately
look
for
another
bottle
of
long
trail
ale
decent
offwhite

that
left
a
good
amount

the
smell
is

the

will
definitely

pretty
good
old

picked
up
a
single
at
princetons
in

mmmm
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
doppelbock
for
the
big
fruity
tang
a
little
roasted
barley
follow
it
up
but
theres
a
distinct
creamy

character
that
ties
the
toasty

to
the
dry

the
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
and
the

isnt

thick
you
can
take
this
as
a
sipper
or
treat
it
as
a
regular
beer
worth
checking
out
o
a
really
nice
beer
and
i
am
very
happy
that
i
got

abv
is
very
well

this
is
on
the
cusp
of
something
special
clean
the
particles
out
and
remove
the
light
chunky
sourdoughvinegary
from
the
yeast
flavor
and
this
becomes
one
to
talk
about
and
search
out
its

a
sixpack
and
probably
worth
it
even
with
these
gripes
overall
this
is
a
richly
malty
wellbalanced
brew
id
like
to
see
more
noble
hop
presence
but
age
could
be
a
factor
as
this
beer
was
purchased
3
months
ago
and
lacks
freshness
dating
sweet
and
sticky
tobacco
almond
and
walnuts
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
robust
and
silky
a
warming
malty
blanket
envelops
and
settles
over
the
palate
nicely
full
bodied
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
pleasant
malty
aftertaste
of
woody
tobacco
and
brown
sugar
very
flavorful
and
somewhat
rich
with
toffee
and
notes
of
caramelized
sugars
a
tasty
beer
that
was
pretty
impressive
hope
to
run
across
more
of
this
soon

overall
all
in

one
of
the
more
impressive
alts
ive
had
in
a
long
while
smooth
solid
flavors
clean
all
in
all
this
one
hits
on
all
cylinders
not
one
id
want
a
ton
of
but
as
a
single
its
exceptional
o
uber
alt
is
a
rampedup
version
of
the
german
classic
that
absolutely
nails
the
style
while
remaining
dangerously
drinkable
definitely
one
of
rush
rivers
best
brews
i
can
see
why
they
call
it
yumyum
juice
uber
alt
is
a
weighty
rendition
which
brings
to
mind
others
doppel
sticke
new
glarus
alt
which
are
a
tough
act
to
follow
but
here
the
whole
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
worth
a
try
and
is
probably
worth
picking
up
bottles
to
laydown
for
a
spell
pairs
very
well
with
lighter
entrees
really
digging
this
brew
not
sure
how
well
it
fits
the
style
but
im
enjoying
it
too
much
to
care
loads
of
depth
sweetness
and
character
time
to
get
me
a
sixer
of
this
onowhere
near
as
bitter
as
the
alt
style
typically
calls
for
that
is
a
good
thing
in
my
opinion
all
alts
from
here
on
out
should
taste
like
this
one
rich
malty
and
decadent
a
dynamite
beer
make
this
the
prototype
overall
i
strongly
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
at
least
once
well
maybe
not
if
you
are
an
ipa
person
but
if
you
dig
scotch
ales
look
this
one
up
and
give
it
a
shot
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toast
toffee
light
caramel
nuts
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
aroma
and
it
is
literally
making
me
salivate
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
lot
of
caramel
buttered
toast
nuts
light
toffee
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
reminds
me
of
victory
brewings
ten
years
alt
which
i
was
very
fond
of
i
can
easily
see
uber
alt
becoming
a
regular
of
mine
on
tap
at
the
black
forest
inn
this
brew
is
a
dark
orange
amber
color
with
a
light
oatmeal
colored
modest
head
and
minor
lacing
the
aroma
brings
somewhat
nondescript
wheat
and
vague
salty
malt
the
flavor
however
comes
on
with
a
licorice
herbal
hop
layered
over
toffee
malt
decided
and
satisfying
for
sure
it
has
tiny
bubble
carbonation
sprite
in
feel
with
a
mediumlight
body
pretty
drinkable
though
not
a
classic
session
beer
once
you
dive
in
for
a
taste
it
doesnt
disappoint
so
i
recommend
you
try
it
and
see
for
yourself
a
good
backyard
quencher
when
youre
not
planning
on
more
than
a
couple
or
so
d
a
little
funky
o
if
somebody
told
me
this
was
an
american
imperial
ipa
id
have
believed
them
it
seems
to
follow
none
of
the
altbiers
textbook
characteristics
other
than
its
definitely
a
maltforward
beer
but
here
the
malt
seems
very
mangled
up
and
messy
its
possible
i
had
this
particular
bottle
well
past
its
prime
from
my
tasting
notes
the
gravel
road
was
a
deep
reddish
amber
color
thats
not
too
heavy
despite
its
7
alcohol
content
i
tasted
a
malty
sweetness
and
slight
caramel
as
well
it
went
down
fast
and
easy
and
was
a
good
introduction
to
rahr
sons
not
a
great
alt
but
not
bad
either
summary
very
nice
altbier
this
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
beer
types
a
nice
alt
reads
as
a
dusseldorf
good
balance
though
oxidization
detected
this
is
a
very
drinkable
7
2
all
told
i
enjoyed
the
beer
finding
it
tremendously
drinkable
though
not
overly
exceptional
certainly
a
good
accompaniment
to
pizza
while
waiting
for
my
flight
has
an
ipa
bitterness
but
without
the
good
citrus
or
floral
smell
and
aroma
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
season
is
winding
down
for
this
grab
a
couple
sixes
if
you
can
find
em
great
brew
for
the
fall
overall
more
of
a
stickebeer
than
what
i
would
consider
an
alt
i
almost
passed
but
im
glad
i
didnt
rich
malty
substantial
almost

ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
one

i
like
this
beer
and
will
be
drinking
more
of
it

packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce

with
a

so
not

not
badan
interesting
bockishscottish
ale
that
drinks
pretty
decent
i
see
this
is
an
altbier
here
on
ba
i
can
see
that
maybe
like
an
imperial
altbier
of
sorts
a
smooth
and
thick
medium
body
but
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
let
you
know
that
the
beer
is
alive
the
flavors
are
all
sweet
and
malty
there
is
caramel
toffee
toasted
dark
bread
and
a
hint
of
maple
all
of
this
smoothly
transitions
to
a
slightly
bitter
finish
thats
just
dry
enough
to
make
you
really
want
that
next
sip
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
wishing
that
altbier
was
a
more
readily
available
style
bitter
finish
yet
very
smooth
i
also
find
it
to
be
ever
so
slightly
under
carbonated
which
is
a
common
complaint
of
mine
from
rahr
beers
in
general
overall
pretty
good
this
would
pair
better
with
food
than
it
stands
alone
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownishred
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
toffee
with
some
dark
fruit
added
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
and
hazelnut
notes
with
some
dark
fruit
thrown
in
light
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
the
beer
because
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
a
decent
easy
drinker
but
nothing
too
exciting
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
decent
representation
of
this
style
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
more
favorite
beers
that
i
have
tried
from
rahr
their
barrel
aged
winter
warmer
is
my
favorite
so
far
this
one
is
a
little
green
but
this
is
a
hard
style
to
do
well
and
they
did
pretty
well
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
altbiers
like
i
am
i
would
give
this
one
a
day
in
court
overall
this
beer
is
okay
o
great
representation
of
the
style
as
the
hops
and
malts
are
very
well
balanced
its
easy
to
drink
and
the
subtle
flavors
dont
overpower
one
another
o
smoky
interesting
decent
like
most
everything
from
rahr
just
ho
hum
nothing
particularly
wrong
but
boring
nothing
i
would
recommend
but
nothing
bad
either
once
again
i
am
still
trying
to
find
out
what
an
altbeir
acutally
is
i
dont
thing
this
is
one
im
all
for
supporting
the
rahr
brewery
but
i
felt
this
brew
was
below
their
standards
id
be
willing
to
try
another
one
and
give
rahr
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
my
buddy
scott
stumbled
across
this
cheers
it
is
dark
translucent
brown
with
very
little
head
the
smell
gets
things
going
though
with
caramel
wood
and
a
biscuit
smell
the
taste
is
slightly
sharp
and
almost
smoky
with
a
kind
of
earthy
aftertaste
very
easy
to
drink
see
i
just
did
it
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
little
slippery
overall
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
character
id
like
it
with
bbq
i
imagine
and
i
like
it
in
me
im
sure
somewhere
between
buy
another
sixer
and
buy
a
keg
id
say
o
i
found
this
to
just
be
okay
it
wasnt
all
that
aromatic
or
flavorful
overallaltbiers
are
not
a
style
i
prefer
but
have
enjoyed
the
others
ive
hadspoetzl
long
trail
but
this
one
didnt
really
bring
much
flavor
or
anything
to
really
savor
or
enjoy
not
for
me
and
probably
wont
be
for
you
either
overall
this
was
disappointing
i
am
going
to
revisit
this
if
i
find
any
difference
when
i
come
back
to
it
but
ultimately
a
strangely
flavorless
brew
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
a
nice
bit
of
experimentation
sort
of
a
altbierlight
porter
nothing
earth
shattering
but
id
happily
have
another
or
six
while
the
rahr
brewery
generally
impresses
me
this
beer
does
not
i
would
probably
have
called
it
a
strong
porter
rather
than
an
alt
it
doesnt
fit
alt
characteristics
at
all
and
its
just
not
a
very
interesting
beer
the
beer
is
dark
copper
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
faded
and
left
a
filmy
layer
and
lacing
it
smells
strangely
of
mint
with
some
spicy
hops
and
fruit
its
a
very
different
smell
for
a
beer
but
it
does
smell
quite
good
it
tastes
bitter
with
lemon
and
pine
there
is
a
lot
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
dark
fruit
the
beer
is
thick
with
low
carbonation
and
a
sticky
lingering
finish
this
is
the
best
altbier
ive
had
so
far
it
is
very
balanced
between
sweet
and
bitter
o
this
is
tasty
although
i
have
no
basis
as
to
the
style
reading
about
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
style
it
seems
pretty
close
well
done
rahr
12
oz
bottle
poured
to

glass
a
hazed
dark
amber
pour
with
little
head
that
quickly
fades
to
collar
and
almost
no
lace
aroma
of
toasted
malt
and
a
spice
like
a
rye
the
flavor
is
caramel
malt
balanced
with
a
haylike
hop
and
tangy
spice
has
an
earthy
slightly
bitter
and
dry
finish
more
than
average
carbonation
keeps
it
lively
think
this
beer
would
be
perfect
when
paired
with
a
grilled
pork
chop
go
rahr
this
is
a
nice
new
brew
from
rahr
its
dangerously
quaffable
the
alcohol
never
gets
in
the
way
its
practically
unnoticed
not
necessarily
the
best
altbier
i
have
had
it
does
though
hit
all
the
right
notes
props
to
rahr
for
creating
another
tasty
brew
